00:13.833 --> 00:15.233
Hello?

00:15.234 --> 00:17.401
Flynn.

00:31.117 --> 00:33.185
Charlene?

00:33.186 --> 00:35.820
Flynn.

00:43.062 --> 00:45.096
Flynn.

01:01.147 --> 01:03.614
He's coming.

01:30.877 --> 01:34.546
We're scaling this cliff
because of a bad dream?

01:34.547 --> 01:37.082
Not a dream. An apocalyptic vision.

01:37.083 --> 01:39.617
And Charlene is the
only one who can stop it.

01:43.322 --> 01:44.523
I'm still confused.

01:44.524 --> 01:46.291
How can Charlene stop it?

01:46.292 --> 01:49.828
Exactly. How. That's
what we have to find out.

01:53.266 --> 01:55.267
And you're sure she's here?

01:55.268 --> 01:56.935
Professor friend of mine

01:56.936 --> 01:58.559
at the Peruvian
Anthropological Institute

01:58.560 --> 02:00.472
telephoned me after he spotted her

02:00.473 --> 02:04.109
on a bus surrounded by
Tarantilla guerillas.

02:04.110 --> 02:06.144
The Tarantilla are a brutal cult

02:06.145 --> 02:07.479
who worship ancient Incan gods.

02:07.480 --> 02:09.381
They perform human sacrifices!

02:09.382 --> 02:10.582
Last the professor saw,

02:10.583 --> 02:12.451
they were headed to this very temple.

02:13.820 --> 02:15.887
That's Charlene's voice.

02:15.888 --> 02:17.988
I'd know it anywhere.

02:26.399 --> 02:28.900
How many?

02:28.901 --> 02:31.336
Three sets of shuffling footsteps.

02:31.337 --> 02:33.138
Heavy breathing from two others.

02:33.139 --> 02:34.372
One lifting something heavy,

02:34.373 --> 02:36.740
the other applying pressure.

02:39.011 --> 02:40.212
- Oh!
- Charlene!

02:40.213 --> 02:41.446
Charlene.

02:41.447 --> 02:44.082
Oh, Flynn. Eve.

02:44.083 --> 02:46.051
You're a sight for sore eyes.

02:46.052 --> 02:48.086
And a sore neck. Esteban, can you...

02:48.087 --> 02:49.588
ah, thank you.

02:49.589 --> 02:51.389
We thought you were in danger.

02:51.390 --> 02:52.624
Oh, don't be silly.

02:52.625 --> 02:55.360
I just needed a little distraction.

02:55.361 --> 02:58.330
After I lost Judson, I
needed to clear my head.

02:58.331 --> 03:01.199
- Nice clearing.
- Thank you.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.869
These are our brutal cultists?

03:03.870 --> 03:07.239
No, no. They're just misunderstood.

03:07.240 --> 03:09.040
I just had to show
them the understanding

03:09.041 --> 03:12.010
of a mature, sensual woman.

03:12.011 --> 03:15.480
Whew. You used an enchantment artifact.

03:15.481 --> 03:18.415
What? No. Oh, I am offended.

03:21.120 --> 03:23.143
You made them think that
you were an Incan goddess.

03:23.144 --> 03:24.656
So sue me.

03:24.657 --> 03:26.525
I just needed a little affection.

03:26.526 --> 03:28.593
- Is that so wrong?
- Well, good for you.

03:28.594 --> 03:31.463
It's important to take
personal time once in a while.

03:31.464 --> 03:33.265
Thank you.

03:33.266 --> 03:36.066
Gentlemen, take five.

03:40.039 --> 03:42.440
Take four.

03:42.441 --> 03:45.177
- Ooh.
- I missed you so much.

03:45.178 --> 03:46.945
I... I can't breathe.

03:46.946 --> 03:50.215
Mm.

03:50.216 --> 03:52.083
You're still wearing it.

03:52.084 --> 03:55.253
I haven't taken it off
since you gave it to me.

03:55.254 --> 03:59.024
You know, I don't think
that I've ever even told you

03:59.025 --> 04:01.660
- how much...
- We need you back at the Library.

04:01.661 --> 04:03.395
That's why we came.

04:03.396 --> 04:06.498
No, no. Uh, no, I can't do that.

04:06.499 --> 04:08.633
We wouldn't ask you if
it weren't important.

04:08.634 --> 04:10.035
Oh, I'm sure that's true,

04:10.036 --> 04:14.139
but, uh, this is where I need to be,

04:14.140 --> 04:16.308
and nothing you can say
is going to change my mind.

04:16.309 --> 04:17.851
Cassandra's been doing the accounting.

04:17.853 --> 04:19.377
- What? No!
- Yes.

04:19.378 --> 04:22.546
She knows math, but she knows
nothing about accounts pay...

04:25.218 --> 04:26.952
I see what you did.

04:26.953 --> 04:29.521
Ooh, I like her.

04:29.522 --> 04:32.557
I'm sorry, but I just haven't finished

04:32.558 --> 04:35.260
balancing my emotional checkbook.

04:35.261 --> 04:38.163
Apep is back.

04:38.164 --> 04:40.465
Esteban.

04:42.101 --> 04:43.368
Take them to the guest chamber.

04:43.369 --> 04:45.136
I assume you don't mind sharing a bed.

04:45.137 --> 04:47.772
- No, you know...
- Wherever.

04:47.773 --> 04:49.174
Whatever's easiest.

04:49.175 --> 04:51.610
We leave at sun up. Go. Go.

04:51.611 --> 04:54.778
Go, go, go!

05:01.020 --> 05:03.121
Wow. Great view.

05:03.122 --> 05:04.322
Great view.

05:04.323 --> 05:05.891
You know, this reminds me.

05:05.892 --> 05:08.994
We really need to take that
vacation we keep talking about.

05:08.995 --> 05:10.562
We could use some unwinding.

05:10.563 --> 05:13.531
Unwinding, unraveling...

05:13.532 --> 05:16.668
decoding, deciphering...

05:16.669 --> 05:17.736
- Same thing.
- Come on.

05:17.737 --> 05:19.404
I love our adventures,

05:19.405 --> 05:21.439
but I'm talking like a
real vacation, you know.

05:21.440 --> 05:24.609
One where we just... are.

05:24.610 --> 05:27.111
Okay, I promise. We will.

05:29.515 --> 05:32.117
You know, it's not really sun up

05:32.118 --> 05:35.253
until the sun clears Mt. Waytapallana.

05:35.254 --> 05:37.022
Oh?

05:37.023 --> 05:38.655
No.

05:40.987 --> 05:42.130
I'm actually really excited.

05:42.131 --> 05:43.662
You know, Charlene and I,

05:43.663 --> 05:46.103
in all these years, we've never
been on an adventure together.

05:46.104 --> 05:48.088
All the years together,
we've never been in the...

05:48.089 --> 05:48.770
Flynn.

05:52.138 --> 05:54.205
He's dead.

05:54.206 --> 05:55.640
They all are.

05:55.641 --> 05:57.475
Charlene!

05:57.476 --> 05:59.019
Esteban has finger bruises on his neck

05:59.020 --> 06:02.180
like he was strangled.

06:02.181 --> 06:04.582
Above the bruises, scratch marks.

06:04.583 --> 06:09.587
First scratch mark is a
third deeper than the rest.

06:09.588 --> 06:12.223
His index fingernail's a third longer.

06:12.224 --> 06:14.392
You're saying he attacked Esteban?

06:14.393 --> 06:16.428
I'm saying they attacked each other.

06:16.429 --> 06:19.297
Judging by the bruises,
the scrapes, the abrasions,

06:19.298 --> 06:20.799
they ripped each other to pieces.

06:20.800 --> 06:23.734
Why would they do that?

06:26.639 --> 06:29.173
Apep.

06:33.693 --> 06:35.894
Mr. Carsen, I implore you, reconsider.

06:35.895 --> 06:38.096
I won't reconsider. I will reconfigure.

06:38.097 --> 06:41.800
I created the door to
find places, not people.

06:41.801 --> 06:43.824
It is simply not designed
to do what you're asking.

06:43.825 --> 06:44.970
Oh, pishky posh, Jenkins.

06:44.971 --> 06:46.405
You underestimate yourself.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.906
This remarkable piece of machinery

06:47.907 --> 06:49.241
has endless possibilities.

06:49.242 --> 06:52.878
I don't... can... can you
talk some sense into him?

06:52.879 --> 06:54.980
And stop the show? Not a chance.

06:54.981 --> 06:58.116
He's like a kitten on catnip.

06:58.117 --> 07:00.752
Simply a matter of focus.

07:00.753 --> 07:02.376
I just have to alternate
the frequencies.

07:02.377 --> 07:03.989
No, sir, it's not that simple.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.891
I've spent years experimenting.

07:05.892 --> 07:08.126
Trial, error after err... no...

07:08.127 --> 07:10.829
after error fine-tuning the technology.

07:10.830 --> 07:13.065
You can't expect an
entire overhaul like this

07:13.066 --> 07:15.067
to work just like that off the bat.

07:15.068 --> 07:17.436
Why is Flynn rewiring our door?

07:17.437 --> 07:20.038
He's trying to use it to find Charlene.

07:20.039 --> 07:22.441
- Can it do that?
- Most emphatically no.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.376
Unless it can.

07:24.377 --> 07:26.912
Instead of honing in
on a specific location,

07:26.913 --> 07:28.180
I have reconfigured it

07:28.181 --> 07:30.249
to home in on a
specific human resonance.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.850
Emotionally-charged vibrations

07:31.851 --> 07:33.418
which we store where?

07:33.419 --> 07:35.220
In our... hearts?

07:35.221 --> 07:38.257
The objects we hold dear.

07:38.258 --> 07:40.641
Oh, the pendant you gave her
that she wears around her neck.

07:40.642 --> 07:42.494
Precisely. She said
she never takes it off.

07:42.495 --> 07:45.397
It is loaded with emotional resonance.

07:45.398 --> 07:47.466
Yeah, no, but for your theory to work,

07:47.467 --> 07:49.368
to make that kind of connection,

07:49.369 --> 07:51.632
you would need another object
of equal emotional strength

07:51.633 --> 07:53.772
on this side of the door.

07:53.773 --> 07:56.815
Something that Charlene loved as much
as or even more than that pendant.

07:56.816 --> 07:59.444
Charlene's accounting
ledgers. Where do you want 'em?

07:59.445 --> 08:01.213
Right on the end of that table.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.448
Still don't get it, man.

08:03.449 --> 08:05.984
What does Apep want with
the Library's accountant?

08:05.985 --> 08:09.755
She was far more than an accountant!

08:09.756 --> 08:12.857
Is there something we
don't know about Charlene?

08:15.995 --> 08:18.263
Tell them.

08:18.264 --> 08:21.932
Ch... Charlene was... is...

08:23.937 --> 08:25.904
a Guardian.

08:25.905 --> 08:27.773
Not just any Guardian.

08:27.774 --> 08:30.078
The most important Guardian
in the history of the Library.

08:30.079 --> 08:32.778
Guardian to the original Librarian,

08:32.779 --> 08:34.578
otherwise known as Judson.

08:36.849 --> 08:38.383
I had no idea.

08:38.384 --> 08:41.453
Her connection to the Library
is a deep and profound...

08:41.453 --> 08:43.422
Inexorable. I mean, she's the one...

08:43.423 --> 08:45.857
Who must be found.

08:45.858 --> 08:48.827
Everything is in place.
Everything is secure.

08:48.828 --> 08:50.928
Okay, let's give it a whirl.

08:54.060 --> 08:55.643
No, no, Mr. Carsen. You cannot do this.

08:55.644 --> 08:57.336
We don't know where the pendant is.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.037
It could be at the bottom of the sea.

08:59.038 --> 09:01.073
You could be beamed into solid stone.

09:01.074 --> 09:02.808
You cannot go through these doors.

09:02.809 --> 09:04.667
Is that the invisible Cloak of Perseus?

09:04.668 --> 09:07.479
No, no, I brought
that upstairs to... oh.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.514
Well, I guess I'm going with him.

09:09.515 --> 09:11.416
- We all will.
- All of us?

09:11.417 --> 09:15.020
Of course. Whatever he
faces, it won't be alone.

09:15.021 --> 09:17.922
And I can't sway your decision?

09:24.430 --> 09:26.598
Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on him.

09:26.599 --> 09:28.666
Ah. You ca...

09:34.240 --> 09:36.407
Jenkins.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.212
Where's Baird?

09:43.449 --> 09:45.450
Door collapsed.

09:45.451 --> 09:47.185
I can't get a cell signal.

09:47.186 --> 09:49.354
I got a bad feeling about this.

09:49.355 --> 09:52.591
What is this place?

09:52.592 --> 09:55.293
Pressurized rooms, pumped-in oxygen,

09:55.294 --> 09:57.229
high-voltage cables,

09:57.230 --> 10:01.266
temperature maintained and
controlled at 68 degrees,

10:01.267 --> 10:03.168
and judging from these
wall reinforcements,

10:03.169 --> 10:05.604
I'm guessing that we
are in an underground...

10:05.605 --> 10:07.472
Supercollider facility.

10:07.473 --> 10:09.975
We're in a supercollider facility?

10:09.976 --> 10:11.543
The question is why.

10:11.544 --> 10:14.946
Why would Apep bring Charlene here?

10:14.947 --> 10:17.049
Question is what the hell happened here?

10:17.050 --> 10:18.483
This place has been ripped up.

10:18.484 --> 10:20.452
Freeze! Hold it right there.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.354
Who are you people?
What are you doing here?

10:22.355 --> 10:25.691
It's okay. We're the Librarians... oh.

10:25.692 --> 10:27.225
How do I know you're not infected?

10:27.226 --> 10:28.593
Infected?

10:28.594 --> 10:31.630
How do I know you're not one of them?

10:31.631 --> 10:35.333
Because... we're the Librarians.

10:35.334 --> 10:37.703
From government census?

10:37.704 --> 10:40.038
To inventory the assembly records?

10:40.039 --> 10:41.422
Why does that always work for you?

10:41.423 --> 10:43.575
We're looking for a woman.
Her name is Charlene.

10:43.576 --> 10:45.644
She's roughly 5'5", blond hair,

10:45.645 --> 10:47.379
very sarcastic.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.414
You people are the only ones I've seen

10:49.415 --> 10:50.749
besides our crew.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.217
Or what's left of them.

10:52.218 --> 10:54.352
Wait, what happened to your crew?

10:56.422 --> 10:58.457
East perimeter's been breached.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.292
They're coming this way.

11:00.293 --> 11:02.726
Hurry! We gotta get out of here.

11:09.535 --> 11:12.471
Somewhere in a
five-mile radius in this?

11:12.472 --> 11:14.740
Sorry. Best I could do. Told you before.

11:14.741 --> 11:16.475
I know, I know, I know, I know.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.477
The door wasn't made to find people.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.212
All right, got it.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.047
We'll find high ground,
scanning as we go.

11:22.048 --> 11:23.381
If we average a ten-minute mile,

11:23.382 --> 11:25.617
we should cover about
one radius per hour.

11:25.618 --> 11:27.018
We'll find them.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.720
If they're still alive.

11:28.721 --> 11:31.088
They have to be.

11:41.467 --> 11:44.035
This is not a time to be getting drunk.

11:44.036 --> 11:46.104
I can think of no better time.

11:46.105 --> 11:47.339
We should never have split up.

11:47.340 --> 11:48.277
It's against protocol.

11:48.278 --> 11:49.878
You know what? Screw protocol.

11:49.879 --> 11:52.022
How long do you think we'd
last here without supplies?

11:52.023 --> 11:53.712
He's out there risking his life for us,

11:53.713 --> 11:56.448
which is supposed to
be your job, Lt. Becker.

11:56.449 --> 11:57.682
Oh, and if they got me,

11:57.683 --> 11:59.184
who protects the rest of you, huh?

11:59.185 --> 12:00.986
Greg, the drunken male nurse?

12:08.127 --> 12:10.428
Tom. Thank God.

12:10.429 --> 12:11.763
Who are you people?

12:11.764 --> 12:13.732
Hey, I'm the head of security here.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.333
I know every face in this facility.

12:15.334 --> 12:17.335
They're okay, Becker.
They're Librarians.

12:17.336 --> 12:19.471
You know every face? How about this one?

12:19.472 --> 12:21.206
Never seen her. I would know.

12:21.207 --> 12:23.001
Unless she was transferred
here this morning.

12:23.002 --> 12:24.945
She could have come before
we went into lockdown.

12:24.946 --> 12:27.112
Lockdown? Did something
happen with the collider?

12:27.113 --> 12:28.816
We were setting the
collider for a test run

12:28.817 --> 12:30.182
when the synchrotrons overheated.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.117
There was an explosion,
fried the phones,

12:32.118 --> 12:33.661
communications, most of the computers.

12:33.662 --> 12:35.120
If somebody was transferred here,

12:35.121 --> 12:36.464
that would be recorded somewhere?

12:36.465 --> 12:38.190
You can check the entrance logs.

12:38.191 --> 12:41.626
All right. What happened
right after the explosion?

12:41.627 --> 12:43.395
They started killing
us is what happened.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.397
Killed? By who?

12:45.398 --> 12:48.099
The crew. Or whatever they
turned into started attacking,

12:48.100 --> 12:49.835
tearing people apart.

12:49.836 --> 12:52.470
I'm sorry. So everybody
started attacking each other?

12:52.471 --> 12:55.140
No. Something infected some of the crew,

12:55.141 --> 12:56.341
made them crazy.

12:56.342 --> 12:57.525
They attacked the rest of us.

12:57.526 --> 12:59.544
Could it have been radiation poisoning?

12:59.545 --> 13:01.079
More like some damn alien virus.

13:01.080 --> 13:04.049
They attacked, our dead rose up,

13:04.050 --> 13:05.383
became just like 'em.

13:05.384 --> 13:07.118
And now they outnumber us two to one.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.462
What about security video?

13:08.463 --> 13:10.355
Can you pull up an
image from the cameras?

13:10.356 --> 13:12.357
No. No, the explosion
wiped out the hard drive.

13:12.358 --> 13:13.833
We can't even override the lockdown.

13:13.834 --> 13:15.057
That's why we're stuck inside.

13:15.058 --> 13:16.328
But you have backups.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.630
- In the server room.
- Okay, where is that?

13:18.631 --> 13:20.198
Oh, you're not going anywhere.

13:20.199 --> 13:21.593
This is the only room that's safe.

13:21.594 --> 13:23.097
Oh, six-inch door, pressurized locks.

13:23.098 --> 13:24.185
I can see why.

13:24.186 --> 13:24.967
Wait a sec, Becker.

13:24.968 --> 13:27.772
Going to the server room
might not be such a bad idea.

13:27.773 --> 13:29.985
If the main SAT line wasn't
damaged in the explosion...

13:29.986 --> 13:32.277
Maybe we could gerry-rig
it to override the lockdown.

13:32.278 --> 13:33.678
Look, we step out there,

13:33.679 --> 13:35.582
we have no idea where
the hell those things are.

13:35.583 --> 13:37.649
Uh, Ezekiel, did you notice

13:37.650 --> 13:39.783
any fire detectors in the hallways?

13:42.622 --> 13:45.211
I reconfigured the
facility's fire detectors

13:45.212 --> 13:47.225
to pick up any fluctuating
heat changes from here.

13:47.226 --> 13:48.826
They make any movements in the hallways,

13:48.850 --> 13:49.794
we'll be able to see.

13:49.795 --> 13:52.068
Look at 'em. It's like evil Pac-Man.

13:52.069 --> 13:54.452
Stone, you and Cassandra stay
here, monitor their movements.

13:54.453 --> 13:55.667
Ezekiel, you're with me.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.438
I need you to help
me search the servers.

13:57.439 --> 13:59.342
I'll hook up the SAT
lines and come back to you.

13:59.343 --> 14:00.876
You better.

14:02.575 --> 14:04.569
Come on, Becker. It's a
level-four clearance room.

14:04.570 --> 14:06.438
We're gonna need your
retina scan to get in.

14:06.439 --> 14:09.447
Flynn, this only tracks the hallways.

14:09.448 --> 14:12.884
I mean, they could be in any
room you walk by or go into.

14:12.885 --> 14:15.253
Okay, whatever's out
there, we can deal with it.

14:15.254 --> 14:16.688
I mean, they're just people, right?

14:22.895 --> 14:24.595
Or not.

14:27.259 --> 14:28.660
All right, so far so good.

14:28.661 --> 14:31.194
You're all clear.

14:35.768 --> 14:39.704
Flynn, you got company coming.

14:39.705 --> 14:41.039
Why the hell are you stopping?

14:48.247 --> 14:50.348
Flynn.

14:52.685 --> 14:54.085
Run! Run!

14:54.086 --> 14:55.919
Through here, Hurry!

15:02.328 --> 15:04.395
Whoa! You ain't kidding.

15:04.396 --> 15:06.430
I told you they were vicious.

15:09.435 --> 15:11.336
Tom. Tom, can you hear me, Tom?

15:11.337 --> 15:13.037
We're all right. Don't worry.

15:13.038 --> 15:15.021
Is there another way to
the server room from here?

15:15.022 --> 15:16.807
Follow me.

15:25.651 --> 15:27.251
What kind of infection would give them

15:27.252 --> 15:28.286
the strength to do this?

15:28.287 --> 15:30.188
Lycanthropy.

15:30.189 --> 15:32.090
What the hell is that?

15:32.091 --> 15:33.291
Werewolves, mate.

15:33.292 --> 15:35.126
And not the dorky Taylor Lautner kind.

15:35.127 --> 15:39.097
Here. This one's working.

15:39.098 --> 15:41.532
Okay, bring up the security footage

15:41.533 --> 15:43.568
and find me Charlene.

15:43.569 --> 15:47.338
Hold up. Werewolves? You're not serious.

15:47.339 --> 15:49.374
Accounts of werewolves
date back to 75,000 BC.

15:49.375 --> 15:50.917
They're found all over the globe.

15:50.918 --> 15:53.142
Japanese have the Kitsune,
the Greeks have the Leycaeon.

15:53.143 --> 15:54.712
Almost all the files are corrupted.

15:54.713 --> 15:56.411
Look, my crew didn't
turn into werewolves.

15:56.412 --> 15:57.555
Well, I'm sure you're right.

15:57.556 --> 15:59.584
Lots of people have
yellow eyes and howl.

15:59.585 --> 16:01.451
Okay. Got something.

16:02.788 --> 16:05.790
Give me the radio.

16:05.791 --> 16:07.492
Cassandra, Stone, do you read me?

16:07.493 --> 16:09.526
We're all here. What about the SAT line?

16:13.532 --> 16:15.866
Not gonna happen. Sorry.

16:17.803 --> 16:20.871
I knew it. I'm gonna die in here.

16:23.542 --> 16:26.210
Ezekiel is sending the feed through.

16:26.211 --> 16:28.345
Now.

16:30.616 --> 16:32.517
Wow.

16:32.518 --> 16:34.752
That is the most powerful
supercollider I've ever seen.

16:34.753 --> 16:36.786
All looks normal so far.

16:38.690 --> 16:40.892
Wait a second. There
should only be four there.

16:40.893 --> 16:42.527
Who is that walking to the computer?

16:42.528 --> 16:43.827
Ezekiel, zoom in.

16:46.498 --> 16:48.166
Come on, Ezekiel.

16:48.167 --> 16:49.400
Yeah, I'm trying,

16:49.401 --> 16:51.153
but I'm dealing with
the digital equivalent

16:51.154 --> 16:52.469
of wet paper.

16:54.540 --> 16:56.973
Right, we're back up. Here's
the footage from earlier.

16:58.644 --> 17:00.778
Who's that man?

17:00.779 --> 17:03.214
That's not a man.

17:03.215 --> 17:05.583
It's a woman. Look at the earring.

17:05.584 --> 17:07.417
It's a woman with blond hair.

17:07.419 --> 17:09.153
It can't be.

17:09.154 --> 17:11.253
Is that...?

17:13.592 --> 17:15.692
Charlene?

17:26.905 --> 17:29.539
Oh, my God.

17:38.951 --> 17:41.252
Military gate guards are trained

17:41.253 --> 17:43.146
to be uncooperative,
hostile, and unfriendly.

17:43.147 --> 17:44.410
Just let me do all the talking.

17:45.858 --> 17:47.592
Colonel Eve Baird,
NATO. Spot inspection.

17:47.593 --> 17:49.308
We're gonna need immediate access.

17:49.309 --> 17:51.496
NATO? I don't think we ever had anyone

17:51.497 --> 17:52.897
from NATO around here.

17:52.898 --> 17:54.799
That must be exciting.

17:54.800 --> 17:57.535
You get to travel around the world, eh?

17:57.536 --> 17:59.337
I had a cousin who dated a guy in NATO.

17:59.338 --> 18:00.805
Frank something? Maybe you know him?

18:00.806 --> 18:02.540
Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank...

18:02.541 --> 18:04.876
Strange guy. Collected glass figurines.

18:04.877 --> 18:06.444
Obsessed with them.

18:06.445 --> 18:07.912
Think he was a little
touched in the head.

18:07.913 --> 18:08.657
Well, interesting,

18:08.658 --> 18:10.982
but we're on a very tight
schedule right now, so...

18:10.983 --> 18:12.550
Where's my manners?

18:12.551 --> 18:14.519
Sgt. Rubin, Canuck Defense.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.320
So you wanna get to the underground lab?

18:16.321 --> 18:18.856
Lab? Lab. Yes, lab.

18:18.857 --> 18:20.958
I haven't been able to
raise the place for hours.

18:20.959 --> 18:22.426
Something of a pickle.

18:22.427 --> 18:24.262
We better get there right away.

18:24.263 --> 18:27.598
Sure. Except the humvee's dead
and the foot path is rough,

18:27.599 --> 18:28.799
but you can follow me.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.767
All right, great. We'll follow you.

18:32.471 --> 18:34.472
Get it back. Get the footage back.

18:34.473 --> 18:35.840
I need to see more.

18:35.841 --> 18:37.424
Yeah, I'm trying, but it's not working.

18:37.425 --> 18:38.943
Just do it. I need to know for sure!

18:38.944 --> 18:40.927
She survived for thousands
of years as a Guardian.

18:40.928 --> 18:42.313
She may have survived this.

18:42.314 --> 18:43.915
Cassandra, any luck on your end?

18:43.916 --> 18:46.384
Yeah, I think I might be able to help.

18:46.385 --> 18:48.719
Digital video stored
in a series of bitmaps?

18:48.720 --> 18:50.354
If I can access the binary codes,

18:50.355 --> 18:51.989
I might be able to
reconstruct the video.

18:51.990 --> 18:53.574
I mean, it's gonna take a while, but...

18:53.575 --> 18:55.860
Do it. Give her access to the drives.

18:55.861 --> 18:57.061
Back to the explosion.

18:57.062 --> 19:00.765
What did you do with the remains?

19:00.766 --> 19:02.433
What did you do with the remains?

19:02.434 --> 19:04.358
What little there was,
we took to the infirmary.

19:04.359 --> 19:05.336
Where is that?

19:05.337 --> 19:06.971
Back two hallways.

19:06.972 --> 19:08.439
We passed 'em when we came here.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.474
But I wouldn't...

19:10.475 --> 19:12.742
Your friend's gonna get himself killed.

19:13.912 --> 19:15.912
Hey.

19:23.522 --> 19:25.623
What in the hell are they doing?

19:25.624 --> 19:29.827
They're running right towards 'em.

19:29.828 --> 19:31.996
Tom. Tom, can you hear me?

19:31.997 --> 19:33.831
You're headed straight for them.

19:33.832 --> 19:38.469
Tom. Tom.

19:38.470 --> 19:41.439
I can't get through.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.606
I can.

20:02.060 --> 20:04.528
It's me! It's me!

20:04.529 --> 20:06.030
Where you going, buddy?

20:06.031 --> 20:07.965
The infirmary. I have
to look for Charlene.

20:07.966 --> 20:09.567
I know, I know, but I have to be sure.

20:09.568 --> 20:10.901
All right, we will, okay?

20:10.902 --> 20:12.502
But right now, we gotta get out of here.

20:12.526 --> 20:13.704
Alive.

20:13.705 --> 20:15.940
Move! Move! Move! They're behind us!

20:15.941 --> 20:17.141
Go! Come on!

20:17.142 --> 20:18.542
This way! This way!

20:18.543 --> 20:19.910
Go, go, go, go!

20:28.453 --> 20:30.120
It's this way.

20:36.028 --> 20:38.029
The bridge. We can pull these pins.

20:38.030 --> 20:39.630
We can collapse it right under 'em.

20:39.631 --> 20:41.098
I've spent my life on catwalks.

20:41.099 --> 20:43.566
I've got this. Go! Go!

20:44.436 --> 20:45.902
Let's go, McCormack!

20:47.673 --> 20:51.609
Aah!

20:51.610 --> 20:53.910
Tom!

21:10.495 --> 21:13.630
Aah!

21:20.005 --> 21:22.940
Aah!

21:22.941 --> 21:25.175
Aah!

21:28.919 --> 21:30.639
We should have never
left the security room.

21:30.640 --> 21:32.214
I told you that was the only safe place.

21:32.215 --> 21:32.967
Where are the remains?

21:32.968 --> 21:34.135
Didn't you hear what your friend said?

21:34.136 --> 21:35.330
McCormack just died up there.

21:35.331 --> 21:36.354
So will countless others,

21:36.355 --> 21:39.153
which is why right now I
need to see those remains!

21:43.980 --> 21:45.947
And just what are you hoping to find?

21:45.948 --> 21:47.349
It's what he's hoping not to find.

21:47.350 --> 21:49.016
And what the hell is that?

21:57.059 --> 21:59.860
Charlene's pendant.

22:06.969 --> 22:08.937
Guys, can you hear me?

22:08.938 --> 22:10.939
I was able to reconstruct
some of the video.

22:10.940 --> 22:12.606
I'm sending it to you now.

22:16.278 --> 22:18.579
Hey, we didn't see this part before.

22:22.985 --> 22:25.152
Wait, Cassandra, freeze that.

22:29.959 --> 22:31.793
Apep?

22:31.794 --> 22:33.395
I think so.

22:33.396 --> 22:35.230
He possessed Charlene.

22:35.231 --> 22:37.265
He possessed her so he could kill her.

22:37.266 --> 22:41.102
The only way that an
immortal can be killed...

22:41.103 --> 22:42.871
from the inside.

22:42.872 --> 22:46.073
There's something else.
Take a look at this.

22:51.447 --> 22:54.516
What the hell is that thing?

22:54.517 --> 22:57.352
Anubis, the jackal-headed

22:57.353 --> 22:59.187
Egyptian lord of the underworld.

22:59.188 --> 23:01.456
The original werewolf.

23:01.457 --> 23:04.359
But how... how...

23:04.360 --> 23:06.995
Guys, we're in Canada,
right? Whereabouts?

23:06.996 --> 23:10.098
Alberta. Ring Rose Peak.

23:10.099 --> 23:12.367
Flynn, that is right on a ley line.

23:12.368 --> 23:14.502
Apep must have been
able to use the collider

23:14.503 --> 23:16.838
to create a space-time rift
and bring Anubis back to life.

23:16.839 --> 23:18.440
This doesn't make any sense.

23:18.441 --> 23:21.276
This doesn't make any sense.

23:21.277 --> 23:22.811
Why would he bring Charlene here

23:22.812 --> 23:24.045
to turn on the supercollider?

23:24.046 --> 23:25.229
That could have been anybody.

23:25.230 --> 23:27.430
Why her?

23:34.323 --> 23:39.094
"In Alexandria, the Library
was born in my defeat.

23:39.095 --> 23:42.997
My resurrection begins
the Library's end.

23:42.998 --> 23:46.034
Starting with you."

23:46.035 --> 23:49.003
Is he talking to us?

23:49.004 --> 23:52.507
He knew that this is where
we'd find the pendant.

23:52.508 --> 23:57.312
He knew that this is
where we'd see his message.

23:57.313 --> 23:59.881
What does all that mean?

23:59.882 --> 24:03.251
It means it's a trap.

24:03.252 --> 24:05.487
The entire thing. He lured us in.

24:05.488 --> 24:06.925
He brought Charlene here

24:06.926 --> 24:08.549
because he knew that
we would follow her!

24:08.550 --> 24:09.891
And he knew that the explosion

24:09.892 --> 24:12.160
would throw the facility into lockdown.

24:12.161 --> 24:14.429
And he summoned Anubis here to kill us.

24:14.430 --> 24:17.332
And every person Anubis
turns into a werewolf

24:17.333 --> 24:20.969
becomes another soldier in Apep's army.

24:20.970 --> 24:24.572
Why did I not see this coming?

24:24.573 --> 24:27.575
You mean to tell me that those deaths,

24:27.576 --> 24:29.043
that blast, those werewolves,

24:29.044 --> 24:30.227
that was all because of you?!

24:30.228 --> 24:33.229
- Hey.
- Get off me!

24:34.617 --> 24:37.218
You sure this is the only
way to get to the lab?

24:37.219 --> 24:38.887
By foot? Yes.

24:38.888 --> 24:40.088
We could walk the roadway,

24:40.089 --> 24:42.157
but it's nearly twice the distance.

24:42.158 --> 24:46.327
Uh, no, it's fine. Just lead the way.

24:46.328 --> 24:48.963
Jenkins, why are you here?

24:48.964 --> 24:51.466
Uh, well, that's the eternal
question, isn't it, Colonel?

24:51.467 --> 24:53.067
Why are any of us here?

24:53.068 --> 24:55.170
I mean specifically here, now, with me.

24:55.171 --> 24:56.461
Whatever do you mean?

24:56.462 --> 24:58.408
Well, it's impossible to
get you out of the Annex.

24:58.409 --> 24:59.998
It's like pulling teeth to
get you out in the field.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.133
Yet as soon as you had the door fixed,

25:01.134 --> 25:02.477
you went through it before I did.

25:02.478 --> 25:04.662
Well, I created the door.
I feel responsible for it.

25:04.663 --> 25:05.880
Don't lie to me.

25:05.881 --> 25:07.382
Oh, I never lie, Colonel.

25:07.383 --> 25:09.651
Omission is as good as a lie.

25:09.652 --> 25:11.595
There's something you're
not telling me, Jenkins.

25:11.596 --> 25:13.154
Something Flynn's not telling me.

25:13.155 --> 25:14.389
I kept asking about Charlene.

25:14.390 --> 25:16.122
He kept ducking my questions.

25:16.123 --> 25:17.467
You started to tell us something,

25:17.468 --> 25:18.560
he cut you off.

25:18.561 --> 25:20.195
And now the Librarians, my Librarians,

25:20.196 --> 25:21.379
are somewhere in these woods,

25:21.380 --> 25:22.664
and I'm completely in the dark.

25:22.665 --> 25:25.900
I deserve to know what's going on.

25:25.901 --> 25:27.635
Couldn't help overhearing.

25:27.636 --> 25:29.699
You lost contact with some
of your friends, did you?

25:29.700 --> 25:31.940
Uh, military colleagues.

25:31.941 --> 25:33.942
We sent them ahead to do a spot check.

25:33.943 --> 25:37.312
Oh, sure. People get lost
around these woods all the time.

25:37.313 --> 25:39.714
So these friends of yours,

25:39.715 --> 25:41.583
you think all four of
'em went into the lab?

25:41.584 --> 25:44.584
We never said there were four.

25:46.622 --> 25:50.191
- Ugh.
- Apep.

25:50.192 --> 25:53.695
Your chaos spell won't work
on us anymore, remember?

25:53.696 --> 25:55.463
But that will.

25:55.464 --> 25:57.932
The only reason I've
kept you alive this long

25:57.933 --> 26:00.301
is I needed to know
your precious Librarians

26:00.302 --> 26:01.469
were in my trap.

26:01.470 --> 26:03.046
And now that I know,

26:03.047 --> 26:05.607
I can join my soldiers and
watch as they kill your friends.

26:05.608 --> 26:07.208
Then there will be no one left

26:07.209 --> 26:09.110
who can stop me from
releasing pure evil.

26:09.111 --> 26:10.311
Colonel, I have an idea,

26:10.312 --> 26:12.247
but you're gonna have to trust me.

26:12.248 --> 26:16.416
Oh, now you wanna talk about trust?

26:28.197 --> 26:29.397
Ugh.

26:29.398 --> 26:31.499
Jenkins. Jenkins, are you all right?

26:31.500 --> 26:33.534
Missed the river by that much.

26:33.535 --> 26:35.603
How did you do that?

26:35.604 --> 26:40.341
One of the advantages of being immortal.

26:40.342 --> 26:43.211
Can help break the fall of your friends.

26:43.212 --> 26:47.115
Oh, God. It doesn't mean I'm
not in extreme pain, though.

26:47.116 --> 26:48.716
We could... we could still track her.

26:48.717 --> 26:50.118
How?

26:50.119 --> 26:52.086
Tracks are like fingerprints.

26:52.087 --> 26:54.355
Her right foot kicks out
further than her left.

26:54.356 --> 26:56.257
- Come on.
- All right, go, go.

26:56.258 --> 26:58.192
I got it. Ah.

26:58.193 --> 27:01.228
Oh, oh, oh. That's a bone right there.

27:02.531 --> 27:05.233
Guys, we gotta come up with a plan.

27:05.234 --> 27:07.467
All right? We...

27:08.671 --> 27:12.106
Hey, what's with your arm, huh?

27:12.107 --> 27:13.741
Is that blood?

27:13.742 --> 27:15.710
Would you believe I
had a tattoo removed?

27:15.711 --> 27:17.645
You got bit. This is serious, all right?

27:17.646 --> 27:19.379
We gotta do something.

27:24.720 --> 27:27.455
Maybe you should just lock me
in here so I can't hurt anyone.

27:27.456 --> 27:30.058
Let me see your eyes.

27:30.059 --> 27:32.527
Pupils are clear. Heart
rate's still regular.

27:32.528 --> 27:34.128
Okay, you haven't started to change yet.

27:34.152 --> 27:35.691
We still have time to do something.

27:35.692 --> 27:37.564
Right, Flynn?

27:38.400 --> 27:40.435
Flynn!

27:44.106 --> 27:46.674
Cassandra, what's going on?

27:46.675 --> 27:50.411
Someone's activated the self destruct.

27:50.412 --> 27:53.548
Where's Becker?

27:53.549 --> 27:55.316
Becker, what have you done?

27:55.317 --> 27:56.784
When the collider blows,

27:56.785 --> 27:59.454
this entire facility will be destroyed,

27:59.455 --> 28:01.822
including those monsters.

28:03.425 --> 28:06.027
We can't let this spread.

28:06.028 --> 28:08.495
It's protocol.

28:29.318 --> 28:34.188
Uh...

28:40.696 --> 28:43.197
Guys, how do we override
the self destruct mode?

28:43.198 --> 28:45.099
You can't.

28:45.100 --> 28:47.668
So what do we do?

28:47.669 --> 28:49.804
We let it blow up.

28:49.805 --> 28:52.439
It's the only thing we can do.

28:56.928 --> 28:58.829
I'm sorry. Let it blow up?

28:58.830 --> 29:00.197
What are you talking about?

29:00.198 --> 29:03.100
The lieutenant is right.

29:03.101 --> 29:05.669
If Apep's gonna create
an army of werewolves,

29:05.670 --> 29:07.437
this is the only way to stop 'em.

29:07.438 --> 29:09.439
And what about the people here?

29:09.440 --> 29:10.741
What about us?

29:10.742 --> 29:12.576
This is not like you, man, all right?

29:12.577 --> 29:15.454
You're the one that taught
us we don't give up, okay?

29:15.455 --> 29:17.147
There is nothing we can't solve

29:17.148 --> 29:18.749
no matter how bad things get.

29:18.750 --> 29:20.951
How did I miss this? How
could I have been so blind?

29:20.952 --> 29:24.688
Everybody has blind
spots, brother. All right?

29:24.689 --> 29:27.157
Sometimes you feel so
deeply about something

29:27.158 --> 29:29.793
you miss the big picture.

29:29.794 --> 29:32.028
How many other people are
gonna die because of me?

29:32.029 --> 29:33.563
Oh, no, no.

29:33.564 --> 29:39.136
The question is how
many more will be saved?

29:39.137 --> 29:41.905
I've got it!

29:41.906 --> 29:44.674
What if we shut down the main power?

29:44.675 --> 29:46.659
Wouldn't that stop the self destruct?

29:46.660 --> 29:48.283
You'd have to shut
down three power lines

29:48.284 --> 29:49.505
in the supercollider chamber.

29:49.506 --> 29:50.747
Low-level, RF, and bias lines.

29:50.748 --> 29:52.048
All simultaneously.

29:52.049 --> 29:53.850
Good luck to the man
trying to get in there.

29:53.851 --> 29:57.187
The hallways are swarming
with those monsters.

29:57.188 --> 29:59.122
What if you're more monster than man?

29:59.123 --> 30:01.591
What are you... absolutely not!

30:01.592 --> 30:03.293
Yeah, think about it, okay?

30:03.294 --> 30:05.896
I've been bitten. I'm
turning into one of them.

30:05.897 --> 30:07.320
If I can get amongst those beasties

30:07.321 --> 30:08.732
and distract them somehow,

30:08.733 --> 30:10.700
then you lot can go
and shut the power down.

30:10.701 --> 30:13.005
Ezekiel, you haven't even
started changing yet, all right?

30:13.006 --> 30:15.105
You don't have the eyes.
You don't have the fangs.

30:15.106 --> 30:17.040
They'll tear you to shreds.

30:17.041 --> 30:19.643
Not necessarily.

30:19.644 --> 30:22.813
Lupine parvovirus attacks
the sudoriferous glands

30:22.814 --> 30:25.215
before it moves on to the
ocular and aural nerves.

30:25.216 --> 30:26.783
Right. What he said.

30:26.784 --> 30:28.351
Meaning that if Ezekiel was changing,

30:28.352 --> 30:29.786
it would start with his scent.

30:29.787 --> 30:31.621
He would smell more like friend...

30:33.291 --> 30:34.724
...than foe.

30:34.725 --> 30:36.059
Okay, so if Ezekiel is right,

30:36.060 --> 30:37.472
how do we get 'em out of the halls?

30:37.473 --> 30:39.196
With steam.

30:39.197 --> 30:40.717
Yeah, uh, the one back at the catwalk,

30:40.718 --> 30:41.901
he copped a face full of it,

30:41.902 --> 30:43.333
and he screamed bloody murder.

30:43.334 --> 30:46.069
Of course. Parvovirus
is related to rabies,

30:46.070 --> 30:47.721
which presents as an
acute fear of water.

30:47.722 --> 30:49.739
The steam will totally
repel all these creatures.

30:49.740 --> 30:51.620
If we can get Ezekiel
into that main radiator...

30:51.621 --> 30:53.221
He could blow all the lines in the hall,

30:53.245 --> 30:54.411
creating a path.

30:54.412 --> 30:56.275
- Once he's done that...
- We'll be able to get

30:56.276 --> 30:57.781
to the supercollider, pull the plugs,

30:57.782 --> 30:59.649
and shut down the self destruct.

30:59.650 --> 31:02.319
Guys, I think we have a plan.

31:02.320 --> 31:04.087
Come on, Jenkins. We
have to stay on her.

31:04.088 --> 31:05.584
Yeah, good Lord.

31:05.585 --> 31:08.291
You know what? I have not been
in this much pain... ugh...

31:08.292 --> 31:10.293
since I jumped off the Hindenburg.

31:10.294 --> 31:13.163
Look, just because you
saved my butt back there...

31:14.999 --> 31:16.900
Don't think I'm letting you off the hook

31:16.901 --> 31:18.068
for keeping secrets from me.

31:18.069 --> 31:20.337
Yes. You're right.

31:20.338 --> 31:22.873
I should have been more forthcoming.

31:22.874 --> 31:25.976
Guardian needs to be able
to trust the Caretaker.

31:25.977 --> 31:28.044
And vice versa.

31:28.045 --> 31:31.381
All right, so you know that Apep
is trying to release pure evil.

31:31.382 --> 31:33.683
What you don't know is
that we are in the midst

31:33.684 --> 31:36.987
of the ultimate battle
between good and evil.

31:36.988 --> 31:38.388
Before the Library was created,

31:38.389 --> 31:40.357
Apep managed to release pure evil,

31:40.358 --> 31:43.460
but Judson and Charlene
were able to banish it.

31:43.461 --> 31:46.429
Now... Judson gone, Apep back,

31:46.430 --> 31:48.732
Charlene is the only one
who knows how to stop it,

31:48.733 --> 31:49.933
and if we don't find her...

31:49.934 --> 31:51.134
We're doomed.

31:51.135 --> 31:53.003
Oh, we are so...

31:56.274 --> 31:58.174
Okay, we're ready when you are.

31:58.175 --> 32:00.943
I'm ready.

32:04.148 --> 32:07.016
I could be wrong about the
whole werewolf scent thing.

32:08.986 --> 32:13.290
Well, at least then I'll die happy...

32:13.291 --> 32:16.225
knowing you were finally
wrong about something.

32:34.779 --> 32:38.014
Nice doggies...

32:38.015 --> 32:41.083
just another member of the wolf pack.

32:47.458 --> 32:49.958
Woof?

33:13.818 --> 33:15.752
They're leaving the hallways.

33:15.753 --> 33:17.320
It worked.

33:17.321 --> 33:18.822
They're breaking up.

33:18.823 --> 33:21.090
Okay, stay here. You guys will be safe.

33:39.810 --> 33:41.378
The hell is that?

33:41.379 --> 33:43.146
Supercollider surging
before the overload.

33:43.147 --> 33:44.214
We need to shut it down.

33:44.215 --> 33:45.319
Cassandra, the power lines!

33:45.320 --> 33:47.550
Yeah, low level, RF, and
bias. All at the same time.

33:47.551 --> 33:50.186
On three, two...

33:50.187 --> 33:51.588
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

33:51.589 --> 33:52.989
Wait? What do you mean wait?

33:52.990 --> 33:54.591
This thing is about to create

33:54.592 --> 33:59.396
the exact same space-time
rift that it did before.

33:59.397 --> 34:01.264
Don't you see? If we
time this just right,

34:01.265 --> 34:03.199
we can send Anubis back through it.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.468
Yeah, if the field doesn't destabilize,

34:05.469 --> 34:07.337
and if you can get
Anubis next to the field

34:07.338 --> 34:09.139
within a 43-second window.

34:09.139 --> 34:11.607
Guys, that's a lot of ifs.

34:31.395 --> 34:35.998
Ezekiel! We need you
to turn off the steam.

34:36.000 --> 34:40.170
Let me guess. You have a cunning plan.

34:40.170 --> 34:42.072
I'm on it.

34:42.072 --> 34:44.540
Ugh.

34:59.457 --> 35:01.991
Something's wrong. The steam's still on.

35:01.992 --> 35:04.194
Ezekiel, we're running out of time!

35:04.195 --> 35:07.296
Ezekiel!

35:22.613 --> 35:25.147
Someone has to shut off the steam.

35:26.884 --> 35:28.618
I'll do it.

35:28.619 --> 35:31.020
Since when did you get courage?

35:31.021 --> 35:33.388
What do you think I have this for?

35:39.463 --> 35:41.064
It's just like the others.

35:41.065 --> 35:43.398
He'll be one of them any minute.

35:50.574 --> 35:52.475
Steam's off!

35:55.112 --> 35:57.013
Be ready!

35:57.014 --> 35:58.614
Okay, get the other one.

36:02.219 --> 36:03.453
Hey!

36:05.556 --> 36:07.657
Hey! Need another soldier for your army?

36:07.658 --> 36:09.658
Try me!

36:11.662 --> 36:13.296
That's it. Come on.

36:13.297 --> 36:14.464
Get ready!

36:14.465 --> 36:17.667
Come on. Come on. That's it.

36:17.668 --> 36:19.401
Wait, wait, wait. Uh-oh.

36:41.525 --> 36:44.059
Apep.

36:47.626 --> 36:49.894
The field's starting to destabilize!

36:49.895 --> 36:51.963
It's now or never, Flynn!

36:51.964 --> 36:53.965
You kinda suck at the whole trap thing.

36:53.966 --> 36:55.366
I mean, I'm still here.

36:55.367 --> 36:58.002
Then you shall die at my hands.

36:58.003 --> 37:01.072
I've always wanted to kill a Librarian.

37:01.073 --> 37:03.841
Come and get me.

37:03.842 --> 37:05.476
We can't just leave him like this.

37:05.477 --> 37:07.045
There's nothing I can do for him.

37:16.021 --> 37:17.588
Ezekiel, what happened?

37:17.589 --> 37:19.724
Apep. Hurry.

37:19.725 --> 37:21.559
Jenkins, keep an eye on him.

37:21.560 --> 37:22.894
Tapetum lucidum in the eyes,

37:22.895 --> 37:24.095
hyperactive follicles.

37:24.096 --> 37:25.663
He's turning into a werewolf.

37:25.664 --> 37:28.064
No, he is not. Not yet.

37:36.442 --> 37:38.009
What's the matter? Are you scared?

37:38.010 --> 37:40.411
Did you really think
I would be so foolish

37:40.412 --> 37:42.046
as to fall into your trap?

37:42.047 --> 37:44.549
You underestimate me, Librarian.

37:44.550 --> 37:46.818
I have thought of everything.

37:46.819 --> 37:48.686
There is no escape.

37:48.687 --> 37:50.788
Today you will die.

37:50.789 --> 37:52.757
You forgot something, Apep.

37:52.758 --> 37:54.625
You forgot the most important thing

37:54.626 --> 37:56.127
if you're gonna kill a Librarian.

37:56.128 --> 37:57.662
And what is that?

37:57.663 --> 38:00.498
His Guardian.

38:27.893 --> 38:30.193
- Aah!
- Cut the power!

38:35.868 --> 38:38.736
What happened?

38:38.737 --> 38:41.571
Who are you?

38:44.843 --> 38:46.811
I can't believe it.

38:46.812 --> 38:50.081
You did it. It's over.

38:50.082 --> 38:52.782
I'd raise a glass, but I'm all out.

39:02.161 --> 39:05.563
That's my last cup of wolfsbane tea.

39:05.564 --> 39:08.065
I'm officially cured.

39:08.066 --> 39:10.901
Think that did it, huh?

39:14.072 --> 39:17.141
Go get it! Go get it!

39:17.142 --> 39:19.075
That's never gonna get old.

39:24.483 --> 39:26.751
Gonna be okay?

39:26.752 --> 39:28.486
I don't know that I'm ever gonna be able

39:28.487 --> 39:30.721
to accept losing Charlene.

39:30.722 --> 39:33.524
Maybe you won't have to.

39:33.525 --> 39:35.374
I was able to reconstruct
more of the video.

39:35.375 --> 39:38.016
Thought you said you weren't gonna
be able to get any more of that.

39:38.040 --> 39:40.598
With their computers, no,
but using magic, however...

39:40.599 --> 39:42.200
Cassandra.

39:42.201 --> 39:44.135
Just used a small reconstruction spell

39:44.136 --> 39:46.737
from "Merlin's Remedial Sorcery," and...

39:46.738 --> 39:49.940
well, just look.

39:56.849 --> 39:58.282
That's not Charlene.

39:58.283 --> 40:01.312
Nope. I looked her up.

40:01.313 --> 40:03.570
Her name's Corporal Victoria Moore.

40:03.571 --> 40:04.989
She worked perimeter security,

40:04.990 --> 40:06.190
had full access to the base.

40:06.191 --> 40:08.125
That's who Apep possessed?

40:08.126 --> 40:10.061
That means at the temple
Apep got the pendant

40:10.062 --> 40:12.129
but Charlene got away.

40:12.130 --> 40:15.699
Of course she did. She's a Guardian.

40:18.904 --> 40:22.139
Flynn? Flynn?

40:22.140 --> 40:25.810
I'm afraid he's already gone.

40:25.811 --> 40:29.112
He... he left this.

40:40.726 --> 40:42.760
"How lucky I am to have someone

40:42.761 --> 40:44.228
who makes saying goodbye so hard.

40:44.229 --> 40:46.898
That's a paraphrase of Winnie the Pooh,

40:46.899 --> 40:48.666
but I mean it.

40:48.667 --> 40:49.934
As you've probably guessed,

40:49.935 --> 40:51.736
I've gone to look for Charlene.

40:51.737 --> 40:53.271
She holds the key to stopping Apep

40:53.272 --> 40:54.672
from releasing pure evil,

40:54.673 --> 40:56.908
but I'm going alone
because after what happened,

40:56.909 --> 40:58.776
I refuse to put you
and the other Librarians

40:58.777 --> 41:00.278
at further risk.

41:00.279 --> 41:02.079
Because of me, lives were lost.

41:02.080 --> 41:04.882
Because of me, we almost lost Ezekiel.

41:04.883 --> 41:06.684
I cannot let that happen again.

41:06.685 --> 41:09.787
But I swear once I
find her I will return.

41:09.788 --> 41:14.190
And then, Eve, I promise
we'll take that vacation."
