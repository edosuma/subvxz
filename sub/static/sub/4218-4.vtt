00:00.959 --> 00:03.086
Previously on
Chicago Fire...

00:03.253 --> 00:05.171
- Stabilize her!
- She's going!

00:06.548 --> 00:09.050
Hey, I need to talk to you.
You said you were gonna
get your arm looked at.

00:09.218 --> 00:10.301
Part of me doesn't
want to know.

00:10.469 --> 00:12.887
There's a surgery
which can take pressure
off the nerve, and...

00:13.055 --> 00:16.099
How long would
I be off work?
Six months to a year.

00:16.266 --> 00:17.433
How long you been
dating this guy?

00:18.936 --> 00:19.727
He's taken.

00:19.895 --> 00:23.773
I got a scar on my back that
reminds me about the price of
playing "beat the clock".

00:23.941 --> 00:25.149
Field-test this idiot.

00:26.026 --> 00:28.861
Look. Detective Voight, that
was his son driving this car.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.780
He's a dirty cop.

00:30.948 --> 00:33.533
You filed a report
that said my son
was drunk that night.

00:33.701 --> 00:34.659
He was.

00:34.827 --> 00:37.328
I can take this
to the next level
real easy.

00:37.496 --> 00:39.872
Believe me,
you are gonna
retract that statement.

00:40.040 --> 00:40.998
What you're asking me
to do...

00:41.166 --> 00:42.500
I'm not asking!

00:45.921 --> 00:47.922
Why didn't you call
Alexa back? I liked her.

00:49.174 --> 00:51.843
You know the joke. What does
a lesbian bring
on a second date?

00:53.429 --> 00:54.971
A moving van.

00:55.139 --> 00:56.889
You have major
commitment issues.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.141
Yeah, yeah.

00:58.308 --> 01:00.977
Can you please put this
out front? I'm gonna take
this stuff to the kitchen.

01:01.145 --> 01:03.896
All right. I am not
carving this thing.

01:07.317 --> 01:10.194
Hey, do we have any spices
around here besides
salt and pepper?

01:10.362 --> 01:12.280
What else do you need
besides salt and pepper?

01:13.490 --> 01:15.742
Wow.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.411
This is for the
trick-or-treaters.
And, heads-up,

01:18.579 --> 01:20.413
Halloween is Chief Boden's
favorite holiday.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.290
Oh, I'm dead serious.

01:25.127 --> 01:26.210
We can see where
you're putting that.

01:26.378 --> 01:29.422
Hey! Nobody touches the candy.
We ran out last year.

01:29.590 --> 01:34.010
I graciously donate my
in-laws' television and I
cannot get a piece of candy?

01:37.181 --> 01:39.599
I keep coriander, cumin
and bay leaves in
the back cupboard.

01:39.767 --> 01:42.101
Um, I used up all the
saffron the last time
I cooked.

01:46.774 --> 01:50.943
Engine 51,
Truck 81, Squad 3,
Ambulance 61,

01:51.111 --> 01:53.237
warehouse fire,
6620 Oak Park...

02:06.376 --> 02:08.503
This is the old
Triskin warehouse.

02:08.670 --> 02:10.713
Looks like the door's
been pried open.
Could be squatters inside.

02:10.881 --> 02:14.217
Smoke's already coming out
pretty quick. We don't have
long on this one.

02:14.384 --> 02:17.553
Engine 51, give me a
two-and-a-half in the front
door, cover the search team.

02:17.721 --> 02:21.474
Truck 81, open up the back,
vent the skylights. Kelly,
give me the primary search.

02:21.642 --> 02:22.517
Yes.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.728
Cruz and Otis, raise
the aerial, take out
the skylights.

02:25.896 --> 02:29.023
Herrmann and Mills,
let's open up the back
and get in there.

02:29.191 --> 02:30.483
Let's go!

02:31.944 --> 02:34.612
Smoke's bad.
Get the doors down back.

02:43.747 --> 02:44.747
Done.

02:45.791 --> 02:48.543
- You in here?
- Mind your step!

02:48.710 --> 02:51.295
Fire department!
Anyone in here?

02:55.801 --> 02:57.885
That smoke's turning ugly.

02:58.053 --> 03:00.221
Fire department!
Anyone in here?

03:00.389 --> 03:02.723
There's someone
in the back! Let's go!

03:03.725 --> 03:05.017
Hey, guys! Over here!

03:05.185 --> 03:07.854
Fire department!
Anybody here?

03:08.021 --> 03:09.647
Pull him out!

03:09.815 --> 03:11.065
I got you. Come on!

03:11.900 --> 03:13.943
Hang on to me.
We're gonna get you out.

03:16.238 --> 03:17.530
I got him.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.240
Fire department!

03:23.787 --> 03:26.330
All companies evacuate
the building!

03:26.498 --> 03:28.541
Come on Mills!
Let's go!

03:30.294 --> 03:31.878
It's gonna flash.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.755
Herrmann and Mills
still inside?

03:34.923 --> 03:35.840
Yeah.

03:36.008 --> 03:37.592
Repeat, evacuate immediately.

03:38.844 --> 03:42.471
Come on now, guys,
we gotta get out of there.
Let's go. Come on, Mills.

03:44.308 --> 03:45.933
Come on, Mills!

03:47.895 --> 03:49.812
There's a guy still inside.
I saw him.

03:49.980 --> 03:52.023
Chief, give me one more
minute to go back in there.

03:52.190 --> 03:53.608
No. It's over.
No more minutes.

03:53.775 --> 03:54.817
He could be alive!

03:54.985 --> 03:56.777
Just give me one more minute!
I know I can get to him.
I know...

03:56.945 --> 03:58.779
You're not going anywhere.
This building's about
to flash.

03:58.947 --> 04:00.865
Chief, I can get...
Enough!

04:04.369 --> 04:06.829
All officers take count
of your firefighters.
Nobody goes back in.

04:06.997 --> 04:08.873
All members out
of the collapse zone.

04:09.041 --> 04:11.751
Everybody back up.
Back it up.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.294
Let's go.

04:13.462 --> 04:15.379
Company 16...

04:15.547 --> 04:18.132
Roger that 25,
Ladder 47, engines set.

04:31.063 --> 04:32.939
Fire up the water cannons.

04:59.091 --> 05:01.384
Come on, let's go!
Boys! Boys!

05:01.551 --> 05:04.261
Hey! Give her back the wand.
Now! Hey, hey.

05:04.429 --> 05:05.471
Here you go.

05:10.769 --> 05:11.894
I thought you were
gonna be a superhero.

05:12.062 --> 05:14.397
I am. I'm Superboy.

05:14.564 --> 05:15.731
That's the whole costume?

05:17.651 --> 05:19.485
That's pretty half-assed.
Christopher!

05:19.653 --> 05:21.070
What, he can't
put on a cape?

05:21.238 --> 05:22.905
He doesn't have...

05:24.658 --> 05:28.536
I walked in on your dad
again on the can. The man
refuses to lock the door.

05:28.704 --> 05:30.246
And you refuse to knock.

05:34.668 --> 05:35.835
This came.

05:37.254 --> 05:38.546
Ah, crap.

05:40.465 --> 05:41.757
Were you there, Daddy?

05:43.093 --> 05:46.554
Yep, and we kicked
that fire's butt.

05:46.722 --> 05:48.639
Love you. Okay, bye.
Bye.

05:54.813 --> 05:57.690
You can't leave.
I put a force field
around the door.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.942
If you had a cape on,
I might believe that.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.610
Come on. I'm late.
No.

06:03.655 --> 06:05.906
Lukie, hey.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.745
I told you, you don't have to
worry about me so much.

06:10.912 --> 06:12.621
What if you
get hurt again?

06:14.791 --> 06:17.334
I'll get better.
Just like last time.

06:17.502 --> 06:19.545
And like you did,
when your bike went over.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.716
Us Herrmanns,
we're tough bastards.

06:24.676 --> 06:26.552
You said "bastards".

06:26.720 --> 06:28.804
Don't tell Mom.

06:32.184 --> 06:34.852
Okay, come on. Come on, buddy.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.106
I love you, buddy.

06:48.492 --> 06:51.660
Happy Halloween!
Happy Halloween!

06:53.163 --> 06:59.418
Guess what? After school
I'm gonna break out a
bottomless bowl of treats.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.670
You gonna come back
and get them? You gonna
bring them back?

07:01.838 --> 07:04.131
Yeah!
Then get out of here
and come back.

07:05.884 --> 07:08.385
You all look great!
Thank you!

07:08.553 --> 07:10.513
Lieutenant, can I
ask you something?
Sure.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.265
In general, when Chief says
"everybody out of
the building now,"

07:13.433 --> 07:14.642
how much time
do we really have?

07:14.810 --> 07:16.602
A minute?
Thirty seconds? What?

07:17.854 --> 07:19.355
Don't beat
yourself up, Mills.

07:19.523 --> 07:23.526
The thing is, I was closest
to the victim. I could
see him, you know? I...

07:23.693 --> 07:25.820
When Chief says now,
he means now.

07:25.987 --> 07:29.031
Not 30 seconds,
not any seconds.
Got it?

07:32.452 --> 07:36.497
Yeah. Yeah, I figured.
Thanks.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.129
Uh!

07:45.590 --> 07:49.176
Morning, Lieutenant.
Morning.

07:49.344 --> 07:50.845
You get hurt
the other night?

07:52.264 --> 07:54.473
You mind not turning the
locker room into a chat room?

07:55.892 --> 07:56.892
Yeah.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.818
Just take the damn piece
of candy, already.
She won't notice.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.987
I'm not climbing
onto the counter.

08:10.574 --> 08:14.535
Hey, did you guys hear that
Casey's gonna testify against
Detective Voight's son?

08:15.745 --> 08:18.539
Apparently Dawson's brother
says it's a risky move.

08:18.707 --> 08:20.332
Voight's a dangerous
son-of-a-bitch.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.210
I wouldn't put my ass
on the line like that.

08:25.672 --> 08:31.302
Lieutenant, you need any help
with the Detective Voight
situation, you let me know.

08:31.469 --> 08:35.764
When I became union rep,
they sent me a
bunch of brochures...

08:36.725 --> 08:41.437
I'm good, thanks. Just have
to testify at the arraignment,
once it's set.

08:41.605 --> 08:42.938
You see this crap?

08:44.524 --> 08:46.942
Why is that crap?

08:47.110 --> 08:48.819
I just mean...
That's what happened,
isn't it? So?

08:48.987 --> 08:53.699
Where's the headline about
how we busted our humps and
saved three guys? Huh?

08:53.867 --> 08:56.202
Okay, everybody, listen up.

08:56.369 --> 09:02.249
Today our very own Jose Vargas
transfers from Truck to Squad.

09:02.417 --> 09:05.711
As of now, he's officially
a member of Rescue Squad 3.

09:07.631 --> 09:10.341
- Whoo!
- Big time Vargas!

09:10.508 --> 09:12.635
I'll make sure to bow
next time you walk by.

09:14.721 --> 09:15.888
Best of luck.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.223
Thanks, Lieutenant.

09:18.183 --> 09:21.018
Hey, Lieutenant Casey, I just
saw your car out front.
Something happened to it.

09:27.108 --> 09:29.568
What the hell?
This is why I can't
stand Halloween, man.

09:29.736 --> 09:30.736
The punks, they go wild.

09:32.364 --> 09:33.614
My gym bag got lifted...

09:33.782 --> 09:37.201
Right in front of the station.
Call the cops, file a report.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.370
Yeah, I should...

09:41.790 --> 09:45.292
Alarm Truck 81.
Squad 3. House fire,
220 South Kilbourn.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.470
Fire's out on arrival,
hold all incoming companies.

09:56.638 --> 09:59.473
We'll do a little overhaul.
You okay, ma'am?

09:59.641 --> 10:01.684
I'm fine.

10:01.851 --> 10:06.939
I must've dropped a cigarette
or something while I was
cleaning out the garage.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.399
So stupid of me.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.150
Well, good job
putting it out.

10:15.740 --> 10:18.742
We were here a few weeks ago.
Fire in your car,
parked out front?

10:20.578 --> 10:22.204
The car is old.

10:23.540 --> 10:24.915
Two fires in two weeks?

10:25.792 --> 10:27.751
Bad luck always
comes in streaks.

10:29.087 --> 10:31.046
Yo, yo.
Good afternoon, Officer.

10:35.260 --> 10:38.387
I need to check inside,
make sure the fire didn't get
into the adjoining wall.

10:38.555 --> 10:39.555
All right.

10:46.771 --> 10:47.896
No heat, that's good.

10:50.775 --> 10:53.027
Me and my late husband.

10:53.194 --> 10:57.031
How long were you married?
45 years, until he passed.

10:57.198 --> 10:59.491
Wow. What's the secret?

10:59.659 --> 11:03.704
I never asked.
Just counted my
blessings every day.

11:11.046 --> 11:12.755
Did she say what happened?
Uh-uh.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.813
What the hell happened?
It went out.

11:29.981 --> 11:31.607
What?

11:31.775 --> 11:33.734
It just needed a new cord,
nobody panic.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.361
Go ahead, try it.

11:36.780 --> 11:37.863
- Yes!
- Ah...

11:38.031 --> 11:41.200
Halloween Horror Marathon,
Channel 11.
We are back.

11:44.954 --> 11:48.624
My brother died
because he was homeless
and poor.

11:48.792 --> 11:51.919
If he had been a firefighter
or a banker

11:52.087 --> 11:55.714
in a fancy apartment,
they would've found
a way to save him.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.008
It was recorded
on cell phone...

11:58.176 --> 12:00.135
Chief, give me one more
minute to go back in there.

12:00.303 --> 12:01.553
No, it's over.
No more minutes.

12:01.721 --> 12:05.182
He could be alive.
Just give me one more minute.
I know I can get to him.

12:05.350 --> 12:08.811
You're not going
anywhere. This building's
about to flash. Enough!

12:08.978 --> 12:13.440
Even his own men wanted
to go back in and
save my brother's life.

12:13.608 --> 12:18.320
But the Chief on the scene,
Wallace Boden, said no.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.697
So the
investigation continues...

12:34.337 --> 12:38.715
Hey. There's another request
for an interview about
the fire, from some blogger.

12:38.883 --> 12:41.301
The answer's the same.
No comment.

12:42.178 --> 12:45.681
Got it. And Peter Mills
wanted to see you.

12:45.849 --> 12:47.808
Send him in.

12:47.976 --> 12:49.518
Thanks.
Sure.

12:49.686 --> 12:50.644
Hey, Mills.
What's up?

12:51.771 --> 12:55.190
Um, when I asked to go
back in, I apologize if
that was out of line.

12:55.358 --> 12:58.986
Not another word.
That is exactly the attitude
I want from all my men.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.157
Forget the news report.

13:04.659 --> 13:07.786
Yes, sir. Thank you.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.001
You're welcome.

13:20.425 --> 13:21.967
Hey, we've got our
first trick-or-treater!

13:22.135 --> 13:24.636
Hey, guys. Happy Halloween.
Happy Halloween, lady.

13:24.804 --> 13:25.929
Sweet shoes.

13:26.097 --> 13:28.599
Thanks. Uh, you're
a runner too?

13:28.766 --> 13:32.269
Uh, I just did my first 10-K a
couple of months ago.

13:32.437 --> 13:34.521
Oh, wow. That's my race, too.

13:34.689 --> 13:38.233
I've been training for
the next one. I'm trying to
get in under 48 minutes.

13:38.401 --> 13:39.693
That sounds like a good goal.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.821
How'd you do?
45:20.

13:44.699 --> 13:46.825
Wow. That's great.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.871
Casey's in his quarters,
I think.
Awesome, thank you.

13:51.039 --> 13:52.456
I'll see you guys.
Yep.

13:52.624 --> 13:53.832
Bye.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.543
45:20?

13:56.711 --> 13:58.253
It was somewhere
around there.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.759
Everything okay?

14:03.927 --> 14:06.094
Of course.
Why do you look worried?

14:07.263 --> 14:11.850
I... I'm not worried,
just surprised.

14:12.727 --> 14:16.355
Well, I was thinking about our
new plan to start fresh.

14:16.523 --> 14:19.566
And I realized...
What?

14:20.610 --> 14:22.736
That there is something that
we talked about doing
and never did.

14:24.697 --> 14:25.697
Yeah?

14:59.732 --> 15:01.608
Chief, this is
Sondra Sherman...

15:01.776 --> 15:03.902
I'm an attorney
with the City's office.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.488
How can we
help you today?

15:06.656 --> 15:11.493
I need to ask you some
questions about the
Triskin warehouse fire.

15:11.661 --> 15:12.619
Why?

15:12.787 --> 15:15.664
The City's been contacted by

15:15.832 --> 15:18.500
an attorney for Marc Thorne,
the victim's brother.

15:18.668 --> 15:22.337
There are some concerns
about the way the fire
was handled.

15:22.505 --> 15:24.298
My sympathies go out
to Mr. Thorne,

15:24.465 --> 15:26.675
but if I hadn't handled
the fire the way that I did,

15:26.843 --> 15:29.177
not only would his brother
be dead, but so would my men.

15:29.345 --> 15:33.974
Mmm-hmm. And how long was it
after you called your men out
that the structure exploded?

15:34.142 --> 15:36.810
I don't know exactly.
Oh.

15:36.978 --> 15:39.229
About a minute.

15:39.397 --> 15:42.482
And did one of your men
tell you there was
someone still inside?

15:42.650 --> 15:44.943
Yes, he did.
And he wanted to go
back in and get him.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.779
I said no.
Seconds later,
there was a flashover.

15:49.907 --> 15:53.619
I wouldn't ask you
these questions unless
I had to, Chief.

15:54.454 --> 15:57.164
We don't think you
did anything wrong. But,

15:57.332 --> 15:59.750
an ME's report will be
released soon,

15:59.917 --> 16:03.211
and if it says his brother
was alive up until
the explosion,

16:03.379 --> 16:06.673
Thorne will come after you,
the Department and
the City of Chicago.

16:08.343 --> 16:12.429
The City completely
supports you. You shouldn't
feel bad that...

16:12.597 --> 16:13.597
I don't.

16:18.019 --> 16:20.646
If we're done here,
I have some work to do.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.588
Wait here, guys.

16:47.465 --> 16:49.675
Hey, Bobby.
Thanks for coming.
Good morning. How you doing?

16:49.842 --> 16:52.052
Good.
So, what's the deal here?

16:52.220 --> 16:54.179
You tell me.

17:01.104 --> 17:02.938
Mrs. Grady.
How are you, ma'am?

17:03.106 --> 17:04.231
I'm fine.

17:04.399 --> 17:07.109
We just had a few questions
about those fires
that you had.

17:09.278 --> 17:10.821
They were accidents.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.824
I don't know any more
than I've already told you.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.786
Okay, well, we just want
to be sure that there
are no more incidents.

17:19.622 --> 17:20.664
Sorry...

17:26.754 --> 17:31.091
Someone set fire to her car
two weeks ago. This morning,
her garage burns. She says...

17:31.259 --> 17:32.676
I thought she said
they were just accidents.

17:32.844 --> 17:33.885
They weren't.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.346
Well, why do you think
somebody would come after her?

17:36.514 --> 17:38.473
I mean, she lives alone,
she keeps to herself...

17:42.353 --> 17:43.645
Pick a reason.

17:48.276 --> 17:50.152
I have a suggestion.

17:51.320 --> 17:56.575
If you do a sit-down with
Marc Thorne, that could help
minimize the damage.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.118
A sit-down.
Yeah.

17:58.286 --> 18:03.498
A "beer in the rose garden"
kind of thing. You, Thorne,
attorneys for both sides...

18:03.666 --> 18:07.461
Whose idea was this?
Sit-down was his.
Beer was mine.

18:08.963 --> 18:13.133
Sometimes a simple
conversation can avert
a major lawsuit.

18:13.301 --> 18:15.260
Maybe all he wants
is an apology.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.803
I doubt that.

18:16.971 --> 18:18.764
Chief, I don't think
you understand.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.808
If we can't make this go
away before the ME's
report comes back,

18:21.976 --> 18:23.643
your job and your livelihood
are at risk.

18:23.811 --> 18:26.605
I'm not gonna apologize.
I did nothing wrong, neither
did any of my men.

18:26.773 --> 18:27.939
Look, the City completely
supports you...

18:28.107 --> 18:31.777
You keep saying that.
And in the same breath, you
tell me my job's on the line.

18:34.322 --> 18:35.363
Well...

18:37.825 --> 18:42.370
I really do have work to do.
And I'm gonna go do it.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.758
I have a favor
to ask you.

18:54.926 --> 18:56.802
Can I borrow
your house key?

18:57.720 --> 19:00.597
I just want to set a
little something up
for Kelly in his room.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.557
Champagne, candles...

19:02.725 --> 19:06.353
I think my dad showing up
at your apartment maybe
pushed him away.

19:06.521 --> 19:09.731
Yeah, I don't think it's
your dad showing up
so much that's the problem

19:09.899 --> 19:12.734
as much as him announcing
that you're engaged.

19:13.694 --> 19:15.153
I wasn't hiding that.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.113
Where's your ring?

19:17.281 --> 19:19.449
It's being re-sized
right now.

19:19.617 --> 19:21.159
So can I have
the key or not?

19:21.327 --> 19:23.203
Not. At all.

19:26.958 --> 19:30.252
Ambulance 61.
Hand laceration,
310 East Pearson.

19:45.226 --> 19:48.436
Ooh! You got a nice bleed
going there.

19:48.604 --> 19:49.563
Yikes. What happened?

19:49.730 --> 19:52.232
I was chopping,
and suddenly there were

19:52.400 --> 19:54.609
screams, so I took
my eyes off the onion.

19:54.777 --> 19:56.736
Next thing I know,
my hand is gushing blood.

19:56.904 --> 19:57.863
Screams?

19:58.030 --> 20:01.783
Reaction to a two-tier
baby carriage and
matching car seat.

20:02.743 --> 20:04.077
Wiggle your fingers for me?

20:04.245 --> 20:07.122
Oh, that's not bad,
but yeah, you're
gonna need stitches.

20:08.791 --> 20:11.459
The mom-to-be had
a dizzy spell when
she saw the blood.

20:11.627 --> 20:14.504
Can one of you guys
take a look at her?
Uh, yeah, sure.

20:23.973 --> 20:25.765
You're not gonna
believe this...
What?

20:41.699 --> 20:43.700
Hey, Clare.

20:43.868 --> 20:45.160
Oh, my God.

20:49.874 --> 20:50.874
Um...

20:52.418 --> 20:57.339
Honey, this is Leslie Shay,
my old girlfriend.

21:01.427 --> 21:02.427
Hi.

21:08.684 --> 21:10.602
There are two patients.
We'll take this one
with the hand lack,

21:10.770 --> 21:13.188
so you can grab the
other lady if you don't mind.

21:13.356 --> 21:15.065
Actually, I just put Clarice
in the back of our rig, so...

21:15.232 --> 21:17.233
And I said we would
take him, so...

21:17.401 --> 21:18.818
It doesn't matter to me.

21:19.904 --> 21:21.112
Here you go.

21:26.243 --> 21:28.745
All right, I'm just gonna
check your vitals and
then have a listen

21:28.913 --> 21:30.664
to make sure everything's
okay with the baby.

21:30.831 --> 21:32.499
Okay, I just haven't felt
a kick in a while,

21:32.667 --> 21:33.708
and the dizzy spell
came on so suddenly...

21:33.876 --> 21:36.544
I'm sure everything's
fine, sweetie.

21:40.007 --> 21:41.758
Your blood pressure is good...

21:41.926 --> 21:44.511
I am just gonna lift
your shirt off your belly
and have a listen.

21:54.897 --> 21:56.481
Heart rate's 140,
it's perfect.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.904
Thank you. Thank you, Les.

22:04.699 --> 22:09.202
See? The baby's already got a
flair for the dramatic. The
teen years are gonna be fun.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.790
You know what I
still have of yours?

22:13.958 --> 22:16.251
Those old blues records
your mom gave you.

22:16.419 --> 22:18.878
Oh, yeah.
Forgot about those...

22:20.006 --> 22:22.841
Yeah. You know what,
I can get them back
to you any time.

22:23.009 --> 22:26.219
Why don't you just
give me a call,
we could figure it out.

22:40.067 --> 22:41.401
Who was that?

22:41.569 --> 22:43.737
That's Mills' sister, Elise.
Wow.

22:44.572 --> 22:46.322
When is the next, uh,
family picnic?

22:48.409 --> 22:50.493
Hey, let me give you
a hand with those.
I'm good, thanks.

22:50.661 --> 22:52.787
You sure? If this food ends up
on the floor instead of

22:52.955 --> 22:54.330
the table,
it could cause a riot.

22:54.498 --> 22:57.000
You're Severide,
right?

22:57.168 --> 22:58.501
Kelly.

22:58.669 --> 23:01.963
Peter called, said he was
supposed to make lunch
and got busy.

23:02.131 --> 23:03.965
He didn't sound so great.

23:04.133 --> 23:05.717
Is everything okay
around here?

23:07.261 --> 23:09.387
Just another day on the job.

23:09.555 --> 23:10.597
Your brother's a good kid.

23:10.765 --> 23:12.932
Yeah, he is.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.438
I gotta get back
to the restaurant.
Thanks for the help.

23:22.860 --> 23:25.070
- Give me the ball.
- Oh... Oh!

23:26.697 --> 23:30.366
My name is Marc Thorne.
I'm here to talk to
Chief Wallace Boden.

23:31.744 --> 23:32.952
Is he here?

23:43.839 --> 23:45.632
I'm very sorry
for your loss,
Mr. Thorne.

23:51.806 --> 23:52.722
Chief Boden!

23:55.684 --> 23:58.478
You knew my brother
was in that warehouse.

23:59.438 --> 24:04.025
Did you? The guy was homeless,
keeping warm in a warehouse.

24:04.193 --> 24:06.444
You're his brother,
where've you been?

24:06.612 --> 24:10.073
Herrmann... Come on.
Nah, sorry, but I'm
not gonna be quiet.

24:11.200 --> 24:14.202
'Cause a few weeks ago,
I almost bought the farm,

24:14.370 --> 24:17.997
trying to save a stranger.
It's what we do, every day.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.417
It's what we tried to do
for your brother.

24:22.545 --> 24:24.879
Chief Boden made the call
he had to make.

24:30.427 --> 24:32.387
Just be glad you
never have to do that.

24:48.404 --> 24:50.738
What is this?
I heard you
represented, Herrmann.

24:54.618 --> 24:56.828
So I'm gonna throw
out a name.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.538
Clarice Carthage.

24:58.706 --> 25:01.166
Ah... Oh, ho-ho...
Ow...
Wait, who?

25:01.333 --> 25:02.876
The bitchy ex-girlfriend.

25:03.043 --> 25:04.836
She wasn't a bitch, per se...

25:05.004 --> 25:07.130
She was a little
full of herself.

25:07.298 --> 25:11.217
Well, she's got a
new status update.
She is now Clarice Schwartz,

25:11.385 --> 25:14.137
married to a dude
and seven months pregnant.

25:14.305 --> 25:15.471
Oh!

25:15.639 --> 25:19.058
Oh! Did I just call that?
Did I not tell you she had
one foot in, one foot out?

25:19.226 --> 25:20.435
You did not say that.

25:20.603 --> 25:23.396
Well, not to you, maybe.
But did I not call that?

25:23.564 --> 25:24.981
He called that.

25:29.278 --> 25:32.488
Look, he's got candy.
He's got a bunch of candy!

25:32.656 --> 25:36.868
Oh, look at you.
That costume is terrifying.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.703
You're about to scare
the neighbors to death.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.038
You want some treats?

25:40.206 --> 25:43.416
Give me that. Oh!

25:43.584 --> 25:45.752
Hey, I saw your
picture online,
I read about what happened.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.713
Keep your chin up,
you did the right thing.

25:50.132 --> 25:51.382
Appreciate that.

25:52.426 --> 25:53.885
Halloween is about the kids.

25:55.679 --> 25:56.638
Thank you for coming.

25:56.805 --> 25:58.681
Come on, guys,
let's go. Next.

25:59.850 --> 26:02.852
Want to get some more candy?
Should we get some more?
Let's go.

26:11.654 --> 26:14.864
Truck 81,
Ambulance 61. Man down,
3500 block of North Clark.

26:15.032 --> 26:18.034
Oh! Vargas wants back
on Truck already, huh?

26:18.202 --> 26:19.661
Yeah, yeah.

26:42.017 --> 26:47.397
Coming through.
Excuse me, everybody
make way, coming through.

26:47.564 --> 26:49.357
Anybody seen
an injured person?

26:51.110 --> 26:53.736
Is that our guy?
Okay, never mind.

26:54.697 --> 26:56.322
Halloween sucks.

26:56.490 --> 26:57.657
Looking for
an injured person...

26:57.825 --> 27:00.410
Thank God! He's over here.
Can we get some
room please?

27:00.577 --> 27:03.037
Okay. Got a location
on the victim.

27:03.205 --> 27:04.831
"Witches' Brew."

27:04.999 --> 27:06.457
Copy that, right behind you.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.293
- Watch out, guys.
- Hold his head steady.

27:08.460 --> 27:09.794
Guys, come on!

27:12.548 --> 27:14.257
- I got it.
- Hold his head.

27:14.425 --> 27:15.925
Yep.
Did he take any drugs?

27:16.093 --> 27:17.302
No, just a couple beers.

27:17.469 --> 27:20.013
Then all of a sudden
his eyes rolled back in his
head and he dropped,

27:20.180 --> 27:22.390
just started jerking around...
Does he have a
history of seizures?

27:22.558 --> 27:24.309
I don't think so.
But this is only
our second date.

27:24.476 --> 27:27.979
All right, ready.
Turn him over.

27:28.147 --> 27:30.398
Hey, let me
help out, fellas...
Stay back, sir.

27:30.566 --> 27:33.276
Yeah, how about givin' me
a C-4 tube and
a lidocaine drip?

27:33.444 --> 27:36.070
Let them do their job.
All right, come on!
Move it out!

27:36.238 --> 27:39.032
All right, come on!
Don't tell them you're
homeless. They won't help you!

27:40.159 --> 27:44.203
Hey! Hey! Go. Go.

27:47.875 --> 27:50.668
You got your head
screwed on straight?

27:51.545 --> 27:53.880
These people,
mouthing off at us...
We rise above it.

27:56.508 --> 27:59.469
Won't happen again.
Let's get the hell
out of here.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.308
Chief...

28:05.476 --> 28:08.519
I wanted to let you know
the ME's report came in.

28:09.563 --> 28:13.316
Jonathan Thorne died
from injuries sustained
during the explosion.

28:13.484 --> 28:16.319
The department is putting
together a committee now.

28:18.906 --> 28:20.406
This doesn't
change anything.

29:02.783 --> 29:05.618
Lieutenant Casey, there's
someone out front for you.

29:14.294 --> 29:15.586
Detective Voight.

29:16.672 --> 29:18.673
I got some good
news for you, Casey.

29:18.841 --> 29:21.426
Yeah? What's that?

29:22.302 --> 29:24.262
Well, I heard about what
happened to your car.

29:25.514 --> 29:28.182
And I don't normally handle
this kind of thing, but

29:29.685 --> 29:33.604
to be honest, I felt like I
owed you an apology after
my behavior the other day.

29:34.690 --> 29:35.690
I was out of line.

29:36.817 --> 29:39.527
So I put my guys on it
and caught the
little scumbag.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.657
And how'd you know
it was him?

29:44.825 --> 29:46.159
Come here.

29:49.913 --> 29:51.622
Is this yours?

29:54.626 --> 29:56.085
There you go.
He had it on him.

29:59.590 --> 30:01.507
And make sure
nothing's missing,
will you?

30:10.142 --> 30:11.476
This isn't mine.

30:12.394 --> 30:14.812
Well, the kid must
have stashed it in there.

30:14.980 --> 30:17.982
You know, there's a simple,
honest solution to
all our problems.

30:19.610 --> 30:22.528
One that keeps
my son out of jail

30:22.696 --> 30:25.698
and lets you and I
get on with our lives.

30:26.700 --> 30:28.993
All you have to do
is change that report.

30:30.746 --> 30:32.705
I'm not gonna do that.

30:47.471 --> 30:50.431
Last year we went
through four of these.

30:50.599 --> 30:53.351
This year we barely
finished one.

30:53.519 --> 30:54.519
Not the best day.

30:56.939 --> 30:58.231
What is it?

31:04.988 --> 31:07.448
Detective Voight
showed up here.

31:07.616 --> 31:09.617
Tried to bribe me
with a wad of cash.

31:10.619 --> 31:13.621
What? Well, we've gotta
call my brother and tell him.

31:13.789 --> 31:16.916
I'm just gonna testify and let
the courts handle it.

31:18.627 --> 31:19.919
Well, what does
Hallie say?

31:21.255 --> 31:23.673
I didn't tell her.
Why not?

31:23.840 --> 31:26.926
I don't know.
I don't want to worry her,
I guess...

31:28.887 --> 31:30.304
You should tell her.

31:31.682 --> 31:32.723
Yeah.

31:33.725 --> 31:34.976
Yeah, I probably should.

31:38.897 --> 31:42.692
I'll see you later.
Yeah... Later.

31:48.824 --> 31:51.242
I mean, you should've seen
Clarice's apartment.

31:51.410 --> 31:56.497
It was like a museum,
all this fancy
breakable crap everywhere.

31:56.665 --> 32:01.085
The place she and I
used to live, it was peeling
paint, dripping faucets...

32:01.253 --> 32:04.672
But it was great, you wanted
to hang out there all day
long, you know?

32:04.840 --> 32:06.173
Will you pass me a lime?
Yeah.

32:06.341 --> 32:11.220
They had a floor-to-ceiling
wine rack. I mean,
she used to hate wine.

32:12.180 --> 32:14.640
She would drink beer,
I loved that about her.

32:14.808 --> 32:16.392
I guess she drinks wine now.

32:17.853 --> 32:20.479
How long did you two...
Three years.

32:20.647 --> 32:24.900
Yeah, I mean, it wasn't like,
you know, a casual thing.
It was, uh...

32:25.944 --> 32:28.696
We were serious.
Or at least I thought
we were.

32:29.906 --> 32:34.785
Turns out I may
have overestimated
her lesbianism.

32:56.767 --> 32:57.642
Really?

32:58.560 --> 33:01.687
No offense,
I'm not taking advice
from you right now.

33:05.859 --> 33:07.693
This is a new low.

33:17.496 --> 33:18.663
Wanna help with this?

33:26.380 --> 33:27.505
What?

33:29.341 --> 33:30.800
I was engaged once, too.

34:07.379 --> 34:09.797
Just wanted to pass
along some
positive news.

34:10.674 --> 34:13.467
The Thorne situation
has been resolved.
Resolved how?

34:13.635 --> 34:16.637
Marc Thorne has
dropped all plans
to sue the city.

34:17.889 --> 34:19.348
You gave him
a payout.

34:20.267 --> 34:22.518
There's a settlement
in the works, yes.

34:22.686 --> 34:23.936
You yourself said
we did nothing wrong.

34:24.104 --> 34:25.563
You should be
happy about this.

34:26.606 --> 34:29.984
Thorne was willing
to settle quickly and for
a reasonable amount.

34:30.152 --> 34:32.570
There's no further risk
of impact on you

34:32.738 --> 34:34.780
and you continue to have
the City's full support.

34:37.868 --> 34:38.993
Appreciate that.

34:43.665 --> 34:44.665
Take care, Chief.

34:46.626 --> 34:47.626
Yeah.

34:57.137 --> 34:58.471
- How many?
- Three.

35:02.684 --> 35:08.147
House fire, 220
South Kilbourn. Engine 51.
220 South Kilbourn.

35:08.315 --> 35:09.523
Damn it!

35:09.691 --> 35:12.109
Truck and Engine are
near the scene,
they'll meet you there.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.238
What happened?

35:16.406 --> 35:18.741
Molotov cocktail
through the front window.
Fire's under control.

35:18.909 --> 35:20.159
The woman who
lives here,
Mrs. Grady?

35:20.327 --> 35:21.577
With Dawson.

35:23.789 --> 35:26.916
Just breathe in nice and easy.
We're gonna get that smoke out
of your lungs, okay?

35:27.083 --> 35:28.083
Is she okay?

35:28.251 --> 35:30.795
Yeah, smoke inhalation,
oxygen will clear her up.

35:31.671 --> 35:34.173
Hey. Can you give
me a second?

35:36.802 --> 35:37.676
Yeah.

35:43.183 --> 35:44.391
We could've lost you.

35:46.645 --> 35:49.897
I won't go to the police,
okay, I'll promise you that.
But you gotta talk to me.

35:50.065 --> 35:51.065
Okay?

36:17.133 --> 36:18.467
Who the hell are you?

36:18.635 --> 36:21.428
Hey. What you doing?

36:21.596 --> 36:23.430
Shut up. Sit down.

36:32.816 --> 36:35.484
Mrs. Grady, on Kilbourn.

36:35.652 --> 36:36.986
Man, we don't even
know who that is.

36:37.153 --> 36:40.489
She's the one who called
the cops about the drug
dealers on her block.

36:40.657 --> 36:41.699
She's also my aunt.

36:44.536 --> 36:45.536
Listen to me.

36:46.580 --> 36:48.455
If I hear about
one more ember

36:48.623 --> 36:52.626
going anywhere near Mrs. Grady
or her property again,

36:52.794 --> 36:55.754
I'll come back here,
break your kneecaps,

36:55.922 --> 36:57.214
and drag you down
to the police station.

36:57.382 --> 36:59.174
And if you don't have
drugs on you, I'll plant
them on you.

36:59.342 --> 37:00.342
You can't do that.

37:00.510 --> 37:01.594
The hell I can't.

37:03.096 --> 37:05.389
It's a firefighter's word
against a couple bangers.

37:07.601 --> 37:08.767
Who they gonna believe?

37:18.695 --> 37:23.532
Extra, extra!
Firefighters are off
the front page.

37:23.700 --> 37:26.410
Back into the black
smoke we go,
until another tragedy.

37:26.578 --> 37:27.995
Another day, another story.

37:28.163 --> 37:30.789
I wonder how much that
Thorne is getting
from the City?

37:30.957 --> 37:33.876
Why work for a living when you
can sue someone instead?

37:35.003 --> 37:36.086
Morning, Chief.

37:37.714 --> 37:39.715
Our assistant Nicki
has quit.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.384
According to her father,

37:42.552 --> 37:45.888
she has broken off
her engagement and left
for Europe for a while, so...

37:46.806 --> 37:49.725
Will you all just let me know
if you hear of anybody
available for the position?

38:02.781 --> 38:04.031
Leslie Elizabeth Shay.

38:06.076 --> 38:07.076
What.

38:08.954 --> 38:10.454
It's... It's not
a big deal.

38:10.622 --> 38:12.081
No, it is. And...

38:13.375 --> 38:15.751
I'm sorry, but, I'm not gonna
pretend like I don't remember

38:15.919 --> 38:17.962
peeling you off the floor
after that woman
broke your heart.

38:19.089 --> 38:20.798
She is married now.

38:20.966 --> 38:22.424
Taken. Unattainable.

38:25.929 --> 38:26.845
I know.

38:29.015 --> 38:30.641
I just wanted my records back.

38:33.353 --> 38:35.437
I'll buy you a new set,
I promise.

38:43.279 --> 38:45.447
You wanted to see me, Chief?
Yeah, Mills, come on in.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.956
I know you've
been struggling

38:54.124 --> 38:55.541
ever since
the warehouse fire.

38:57.544 --> 38:59.586
Yeah, I was close
enough to see him.
If I'd had...

39:00.672 --> 39:02.631
One minute, I might have...
Let me tell you
about one minute.

39:04.676 --> 39:05.759
I've been there.

39:06.803 --> 39:07.803
Most of us have.

39:08.847 --> 39:10.305
In my case, I was sure.

39:11.141 --> 39:12.516
Surer than you
are right now even.

39:12.684 --> 39:16.478
And if I'd had that
one minute, I would've been
able to go in there

39:16.646 --> 39:18.022
and rescue those people.

39:20.358 --> 39:22.359
My best buddy and I
went running back in.

39:24.654 --> 39:26.071
The fire was trapped
in the ceiling.

39:28.575 --> 39:30.034
We couldn't see it,
so we didn't know.

39:32.662 --> 39:34.121
We didn't have one minute.

39:35.665 --> 39:36.665
We lost the victims.

39:39.294 --> 39:40.502
I lost my friend.

39:41.463 --> 39:44.256
I got a scar on my back
that reminds me
every single day

39:44.424 --> 39:46.383
about the price of playing
"beat the clock".

39:48.803 --> 39:51.597
It is my job
to make sure
that you never get

39:52.807 --> 39:54.099
any kind of reminder.

39:57.103 --> 39:58.687
You understand me?

40:00.899 --> 40:01.982
Yes, sir.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.821
You've got it in you.

40:09.282 --> 40:11.825
You're gonna make
one hell of a firefighter.

40:12.660 --> 40:15.162
Just like your dad was.

40:20.085 --> 40:21.085
Go on.

40:33.473 --> 40:34.932
Jeffrey brings up
a good point.

40:35.100 --> 40:38.227
We'll be opening up
the phone lines shortly
to take your calls.

40:38.394 --> 40:41.313
Let's talk about the Bears
game on Monday. Tuesday it's...

40:52.200 --> 40:53.659
Hey, Karen.
Hi, Peter.

40:53.827 --> 40:55.202
How you doing?
Good.

41:26.484 --> 41:30.070
So where should we go?
Restaurant? Bar? Strip Club?

41:30.238 --> 41:31.822
Yeah, okay...

41:34.617 --> 41:35.826
Hey. You all right?

41:37.996 --> 41:39.079
Yeah.

41:40.957 --> 41:43.417
I just always thought
she was the one.

41:52.468 --> 41:53.594
Strip club it is.

42:01.144 --> 42:02.769
Fifty-one.

42:02.937 --> 42:04.146
Oh, hey, Hallie.

42:05.440 --> 42:06.940
You all right?

42:07.108 --> 42:08.609
Oh, hold on.

42:08.776 --> 42:09.818
Hey.

42:33.051 --> 42:34.176
Matt...

42:35.053 --> 42:36.428
What is going on?
