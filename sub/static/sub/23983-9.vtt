WEBVTT

00:00.133 --> 00:02.951
So, am I ready for adulthood? TBD.

00:02.961 --> 00:05.094
But the thing I'll take
away most from high school

00:05.096 --> 00:07.663
isn't the books I read
or the tests I took.

00:07.665 --> 00:10.866
It's the memories, like Senior Skip Day.

00:10.868 --> 00:12.668
Sorry, Mother Superior.

00:12.670 --> 00:14.904
We didn't really have the flu.

00:14.914 --> 00:16.430
We had twelfth grade-itis.

00:17.908 --> 00:20.400
I can't believe Matthew
finally graduated.

00:20.915 --> 00:23.341
I've never been prouder
of anyone except me.

00:23.351 --> 00:26.120
All day, er'ry day.

00:28.156 --> 00:29.848
Yeah, I'm Hey. D of him, too.

00:29.858 --> 00:31.624
Why aren't you laughing at Matthew?

00:31.635 --> 00:33.925
You wrote this speech for your
class on Award Show Patter.

00:33.936 --> 00:35.587
Gregg hasn't texted me in days.

00:35.597 --> 00:38.490
We grew so close during
the musical, but now, nothing.

00:38.500 --> 00:40.425
He'd better be sick. Like, so sick,

00:40.435 --> 00:43.394
- they write a YA novel about it.
- Hey, don't feel bad.

00:43.404 --> 00:46.397
It's just because he's a
senior and you're a freshman.

00:46.407 --> 00:48.833
- You mean nothing to him.
- Shh.

00:48.843 --> 00:50.401
Matthew's almost done, and I helped him

00:50.411 --> 00:52.537
with this last part for weeks.

00:52.547 --> 00:55.006
Well, I guess there's just
one thing left to say.

00:55.016 --> 00:58.610
Hasta la vista, high school baby.

00:58.620 --> 01:00.578
That means good-bye, high school, baby!

01:00.588 --> 01:03.081
Whoo, yeah!

01:05.827 --> 01:09.220
No, no, bad, weird smile.

01:09.230 --> 01:12.056
Chin up, ugh, guys, this is awful.

01:12.066 --> 01:14.926
Ah, enough with the pictures.
Matty, you did it.

01:14.936 --> 01:17.796
Congratulations.
Now, I'm not a mushy guy

01:17.806 --> 01:19.964
or nothing, but I got you something.

01:19.974 --> 01:22.600
Whoa!

01:22.610 --> 01:24.068
- A gun?
- Belonged to your pop

01:24.078 --> 01:26.504
in the '70s.
He won it in a church raffle.

01:26.514 --> 01:28.306
Okay, maybe we don't flash a gun around.

01:28.316 --> 01:30.909
Anyway,
Matthew, I also got you something.

01:30.919 --> 01:32.644
We are going to expand the gym,

01:32.654 --> 01:34.479
just like Matthew's
been saying we should.

01:34.489 --> 01:37.382
No way, we can finally get
the shower to stop sparking.

01:37.392 --> 01:41.052
- But how are we gonna get the money?
- Well, we've saved a bundle

01:41.062 --> 01:43.288
since Vince cracked
our neighbor's Wi-Fi password.

01:43.298 --> 01:46.191
Yeah, and my old buddy
Leo Kemper's coming to town.

01:46.201 --> 01:48.293
He's pretty high up at
the Cardinals organization.

01:48.303 --> 01:50.094
The Vatican? He gay?

01:50.104 --> 01:52.463
No, the St. Louis Cardinals
baseball team.

01:52.473 --> 01:54.999
And he not gay. Leo's been trying

01:55.009 --> 01:57.135
to straighten this perm
since high school.

01:57.145 --> 01:59.737
And he also owes me one.

01:59.747 --> 02:01.739
In tenth grade, the principal found some

02:01.749 --> 02:03.842
schwag dank chronic in his locker,

02:03.852 --> 02:05.687
- and I said it was mine.
- Oh, wow.

02:05.698 --> 02:07.575
That's when white people
used to get in trouble

02:07.586 --> 02:09.013
for weed, too. That's a big deal.

02:09.023 --> 02:12.317
Wow, what a day.
I graduated, I got a gun,

02:12.327 --> 02:13.818
and we're expanding the gym.

02:13.828 --> 02:16.387
Could anything make this better?

02:16.397 --> 02:20.325
Vince taking me and a couple
friends to graduation pancakes?

02:20.335 --> 02:22.160
Fine.

02:22.170 --> 02:25.463
He said yes!

02:27.037 --> 02:29.533
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

02:29.544 --> 02:32.136
Okay, when you see Leo today,
butter him up,

02:32.146 --> 02:33.806
then tell him my plans for the gym.

02:33.817 --> 02:36.541
Sauna, climbing wall,
and for the ladies,

02:36.551 --> 02:37.976
virtual reality treadmills

02:37.986 --> 02:39.477
where they can run from murderers.

02:39.487 --> 02:41.512
No, no, no.

02:41.522 --> 02:43.081
Ah, someone's in a good mood.

02:43.091 --> 02:44.716
Did an old French lady win an Oscar?

02:44.726 --> 02:46.818
No, I'm just back in control of my life.

02:46.828 --> 02:48.853
Since Gregg still hasn't
responded to my text,

02:48.863 --> 02:50.588
I've decided to do the mature thing.

02:50.598 --> 02:52.924
Ah, take a hint
and never text him again.

02:52.934 --> 02:54.759
No, I'm gonna speak to him face-to-face,

02:54.769 --> 02:56.628
like in an old movie.

02:56.638 --> 02:58.997
Okay, but again, he is a senior.

02:59.007 --> 03:00.899
So if he was even remotely interested,

03:00.909 --> 03:03.701
- he'd be treating you way worse.
- Vince, I don't need you

03:03.711 --> 03:05.737
to put things in perspective
for me right now, okay?

03:05.747 --> 03:08.030
I want to hear the truth.
That I'm a beautiful unicorn

03:08.041 --> 03:09.493
that will one day be crushed to death

03:09.504 --> 03:11.738
under the weight of his own Grammys.

03:12.387 --> 03:15.313
Well, unicorns are immortal,
so that can't happen.

03:15.323 --> 03:17.715
But he burned you, for sure.

03:21.062 --> 03:22.553
Oh, hello, Gregg.

03:22.563 --> 03:26.124
Hope you saved some room for humble pie.

03:26.134 --> 03:28.927
Michael, I am so sorry for ghosting you.

03:28.938 --> 03:30.827
I'm doing a phone cleanse
where I can only look

03:30.838 --> 03:32.864
at one of my phones. How are you?

03:32.874 --> 03:34.788
- I've missed you.
- You've missed me?

03:34.799 --> 03:36.737
That's weird, I haven't
thought about you at all.

03:36.748 --> 03:38.252
How was your half-birthday celebration

03:38.263 --> 03:39.690
with just immediate family last Monday?

03:39.701 --> 03:41.506
Eh, it was whatever.
Anyway, let's grab dinner

03:41.516 --> 03:43.174
sometime, just you and me.

03:43.184 --> 03:47.111
- I do.
- Cool, I'll text you.

03:51.793 --> 03:53.885
Man, it is good to see you, Vince.

03:53.895 --> 03:55.720
- It's been too long.
- Yeah.

03:55.730 --> 03:57.422
Hey, how is Ruby doing?

03:57.432 --> 04:00.625
Ruby McClure, from high
school, who accidentally

04:00.635 --> 04:02.760
spit on my shoe today? Why do you care?

04:02.770 --> 04:04.329
I always thought we had chemistry.

04:04.339 --> 04:05.964
You and Ruby?

04:07.442 --> 04:09.067
- You know she's...
- Out of my league.

04:09.077 --> 04:11.035
Yeah, I get it.
Anyway, you know, you always

04:11.045 --> 04:13.471
were the best of us. I swear, back then,

04:13.481 --> 04:15.206
I thought I'd be the one running the gym

04:15.216 --> 04:17.041
and you'd be the one
arm-wrestling John Hamm

04:17.051 --> 04:18.843
on the cover of "St. Louis Magazine."

04:18.853 --> 04:22.113
Well, thank you, but, uh,
I'm doing good, you know?

04:22.123 --> 04:24.649
Got a kid, hairline's staying put,

04:24.659 --> 04:26.617
and, uh, Tim's doing great.

04:26.627 --> 04:30.221
Speaking of, um, I wanted to let you in

04:30.231 --> 04:33.057
on a sick investment opportunity.

04:33.067 --> 04:34.926
No.

04:34.936 --> 04:37.061
No? But the schwag dank chronic.

04:37.071 --> 04:38.830
- Yeah, I remember.
- So...

04:38.840 --> 04:40.298
I'm not gonna help you, Jim.

04:40.308 --> 04:41.899
'Cause I want you to come work for me.

04:41.909 --> 04:43.835
Okay, just because I'm
dressed like the waitstaff

04:43.845 --> 04:45.436
doesn't mean I need a job.

04:45.446 --> 04:47.739
The Cardinals have a developmental team.

04:47.749 --> 04:49.540
The Baton Rouge Humidity.

04:49.550 --> 04:53.044
Not the best name,
but I want you to manage them.

04:53.054 --> 04:55.613
You want me to manage a baseball team?

04:55.623 --> 04:58.049
Pack your bags, Vince. And remember,

04:58.059 --> 05:01.185
it's not the heat, it's the Humidity.

05:01.195 --> 05:04.288
Team slogan also needs a little
work, but still, you get it.

05:04.298 --> 05:05.866
Are you in?

05:07.837 --> 05:09.610
- Hello?
- Oh, hey.

05:09.621 --> 05:11.529
- You're back early.
- Leo wanted to hit the club,

05:11.540 --> 05:14.058
but there was a $5 cover, so...

05:14.556 --> 05:16.656
- Is Matthew around?
- No, he prayed so hard

05:16.658 --> 05:18.391
that you'd get the loan
that he fell asleep.

05:18.393 --> 05:20.384
- He's still kneeling.
- Oh, boy.

05:22.963 --> 05:26.357
- I didn't get the loan.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

05:26.367 --> 05:29.994
Leo offered me a job managing
a baseball team in Baton Rouge.

05:30.004 --> 05:31.428
- Huh?
- It's like New Orleans,

05:31.438 --> 05:33.697
without Mardi Gras, jazz,
or sexy vampires.

05:33.707 --> 05:35.666
Oh. What did you say?

05:35.676 --> 05:37.968
No, obviously, you know,
I'm taking care of you,

05:37.978 --> 05:41.906
and it's just not the right time.

05:41.916 --> 05:44.408
- Right?
- Yeah, yeah.

05:44.418 --> 05:48.675
- I... I think you made the right choice.
- Exactly, yeah, good, good, good.

05:49.790 --> 05:51.749
- Okay, well, I'm gonna...
- Oh, wait, get this.

05:51.759 --> 05:53.450
- Gregg asked me out.
- Whoa, really?

05:53.460 --> 05:54.818
- Uh-huh!
- It wasn't just a...

05:54.828 --> 05:56.558
Cruel prank
to entertain his friends?

05:56.569 --> 05:59.757
No, it wasn't; it was real.
It was a real ask-out.

05:59.767 --> 06:02.226
- Wow, congrats.
- Thank you.

06:02.236 --> 06:04.194
Unfortunately, that's never,
ever gonna happen.

06:04.204 --> 06:06.130
What, are you kidding?

06:06.140 --> 06:08.332
I want nothing more for you
than to find a rich guy

06:08.342 --> 06:10.034
that can take care of all of us.

06:10.044 --> 06:12.169
- But Gregg's too old.
- Look, I know Gregg's older,

06:12.179 --> 06:13.771
and we have nothing in common.

06:13.781 --> 06:15.839
You know, he's a harpist,
and I write musicals.

06:15.849 --> 06:17.341
But the more we worked together,

06:17.351 --> 06:19.343
the more we realized we click.

06:19.353 --> 06:21.845
Fine, I'll make you a deal.

06:21.855 --> 06:24.982
No date, but Gregg
can come here for dinner.

06:24.992 --> 06:27.885
So we can suss out his real
intentions, Focker style.

06:27.895 --> 06:30.521
Thank you, but get
your weird references like that

06:30.531 --> 06:33.490
- out of your system right now.
- Okay, Jinxy!

06:33.500 --> 06:35.626
Okay, you can stop that, okay.

06:40.341 --> 06:43.367
Oh, look, the world's stupidest guy.

06:43.377 --> 06:45.725
I can check that off
my scavenger hunt list.

06:45.736 --> 06:48.539
Stupid? I'm not the one telling her
boss she's on a scavenger hunt

06:48.549 --> 06:50.908
- in the middle of the workday.
- Leo Kemper called me.

06:50.918 --> 06:52.843
After hitting on me
for, like, 20 minutes,

06:52.853 --> 06:56.213
he told me he offered you a
managing job and you said no?

06:56.223 --> 06:58.382
Yeah, my life's here now,
raising Michael.

06:58.392 --> 07:00.279
Plus, I just put 20 bucks
on a Metro card.

07:00.290 --> 07:01.380
What, am I supposed to burn that?

07:01.391 --> 07:03.120
But this is what you've always wanted.

07:03.130 --> 07:05.723
This would be like me
turning down my dream job.

07:05.733 --> 07:08.425
Stunt coordinator
for the Wonder Woman franchise.

07:08.435 --> 07:11.395
I know, I know, but I just
can't leave Michael again.

07:11.405 --> 07:13.497
Sure, having a deadbeat dad
would help his art,

07:13.507 --> 07:15.566
but I'm not that guy anymore.

07:15.576 --> 07:18.669
You really think he's gonna respect
you more for deferring your dreams?

07:18.679 --> 07:21.305
Seeing them dry up
like a raisin in the sun?

07:21.315 --> 07:24.408
Whoa, now I know you mean it if
you're quoting Langston Hughes.

07:24.418 --> 07:26.043
Langston who?

07:26.053 --> 07:28.345
I saw that on the back
of a Sun-Maid Raisins box.

07:28.355 --> 07:30.547
My point is, there's a reason

07:30.557 --> 07:34.351
you held on to this
baseball junk all these years.

07:34.361 --> 07:35.953
Thank you.

07:35.963 --> 07:38.789
Guys, I went through all your ideas
for the new gym expansion.

07:38.799 --> 07:40.891
Brittany, your negative
calorie celery bar.

07:40.901 --> 07:43.360
Shabaz, your new sound system
for the open mic night.

07:43.370 --> 07:45.295
And Ruby, your cryochamber.

07:45.305 --> 07:47.531
What about my meat shop
for old men to hang out in?

07:47.541 --> 07:49.500
Mm, well, I haven't done the math yet,

07:49.510 --> 07:51.101
but I feel like we can do it all.

07:51.111 --> 07:52.803
- Yeah.
- Bring it in!

07:52.813 --> 07:54.838
Vince hasn't even told us
he has the loan yet.

07:54.848 --> 07:56.607
I would hate for this to be another

07:56.617 --> 07:58.876
"buy the prom dress before
anyone asks me" situation.

07:58.886 --> 08:00.307
Boo!

08:00.318 --> 08:02.070
Dana, I think what they're
trying to say is,

08:02.081 --> 08:03.614
maybe workshop that speech a little bit

08:03.624 --> 08:05.783
before you bring it
to our new open mic night!

08:05.793 --> 08:07.751
Yes!

08:07.761 --> 08:10.354
It's poetry time at the gym!

08:10.364 --> 08:12.256
<i>Hey, Michael, so what's up?</i>

08:12.266 --> 08:14.591
Wow, you get threaded for the big date?

08:14.601 --> 08:15.993
Brows on fleek.

08:16.003 --> 08:17.461
Oh, no one says "on fleek" anymore.

08:17.471 --> 08:19.396
Just stick to the updated slang
I taught you.

08:19.406 --> 08:22.366
- You got it, squirrel-friend.
- Look, I've been thinking.

08:22.376 --> 08:24.201
You have to take this baseball job.

08:24.211 --> 08:25.769
It's your dream, you're perfect for it,

08:25.779 --> 08:27.071
and frankly, it sounds on fleek.

08:27.081 --> 08:28.906
- Wait, what?
- I just got a text.

08:28.916 --> 08:30.941
- "On fleek" is cool again.
- No, no, you want me

08:30.951 --> 08:32.809
to move to Baton Rouge?
You know you're not

08:32.820 --> 08:35.546
- getting my room, right?
- I did not.

08:35.556 --> 08:37.881
But I came to New York to
follow my dreams, like Fievel.

08:37.890 --> 08:39.450
But how can I live my truth

08:39.460 --> 08:41.485
knowing I've kept you from living yours?

08:41.495 --> 08:44.221
- Wait, is this a song?
- Look, I can't go.

08:44.231 --> 08:46.290
Who would take care of you?
Sure, you act mature,

08:46.300 --> 08:48.759
but all your jeans
have elastic waistbands.

08:48.769 --> 08:50.360
Matthew will take care of me.

08:50.370 --> 08:52.129
He already does everything
for both of us,

08:52.139 --> 08:53.964
and I'm basically an adult.

08:53.974 --> 08:56.166
Hello, give me the stock market
on my car phone.

08:56.176 --> 08:58.836
Golf is fun. Tell my wife we're married.

08:58.846 --> 09:02.139
I've got to go use
my MasterCard, good-bye.

09:02.149 --> 09:05.209
Okay, all right, wow.

09:05.219 --> 09:06.810
I can't believe I'm about

09:06.820 --> 09:09.279
to do this, that you're
letting me do this.

09:09.289 --> 09:11.215
Yeah, well, maybe now
you'll be okay with me

09:11.225 --> 09:13.150
getting "Gregg" tattooed
inside my lower lip

09:13.160 --> 09:15.986
before our dinner tonight.
See how cool it would look?

09:15.996 --> 09:19.022
That's never gonna happen.
Okay, I am going to text Leo.

09:19.032 --> 09:22.493
Tell him I want the job.
Then I got to tell Matthew.

09:22.503 --> 09:24.604
Oh, no, you can't.
He will die of a broken heart.

09:32.871 --> 09:35.376
Whoa, whoa, whoa, John Stamos.

09:35.387 --> 09:37.410
Way too sexy. Are you wearing eyeliner?

09:37.421 --> 09:40.188
Are you not wearing eyeliner?
We're having dinner with Gregg.

09:40.199 --> 09:42.757
This is the most important
night of all of our lives.

09:42.759 --> 09:45.226
Okay, relax.
I got enough to worry about.

09:45.228 --> 09:47.119
After dinner, I'm telling
Matthew about the job.

09:47.129 --> 09:48.787
I even bought Kleenex for the tears.

09:48.797 --> 09:51.023
Well, actually,
it's toilet paper, nine-ply.

09:51.033 --> 09:53.292
Anything less than that will
get swept away in the flood.

09:53.302 --> 09:54.860
Mm.

09:54.870 --> 09:57.830
Aw, you look great. Love your eyeliner.

09:57.840 --> 10:00.365
Hey, why'd you guys
go quiet when I walked in?

10:00.375 --> 10:04.937
- Were you talking about me?
- Oh, um, yes, we were.

10:04.947 --> 10:07.406
But it was all compliments.
Keep it up, dude.

10:07.416 --> 10:08.874
- Yeah.
- Compliments?

10:08.884 --> 10:11.376
Dude, you're gonna make me cry.

10:11.386 --> 10:12.678
And you bought more toilet paper?

10:12.688 --> 10:14.746
- This is the best day ever.
- Yeah.

10:19.768 --> 10:21.393
Well, I hope Gregg brought his appetite.

10:21.404 --> 10:23.288
This is the most turkey burgers
I've ever made.

10:23.298 --> 10:25.324
- Four.
- Oh, Gregg doesn't eat meat

10:25.334 --> 10:27.659
or carbs, but he will have ketchup

10:27.669 --> 10:29.161
and conflict-free lettuce.

10:29.171 --> 10:31.029
What, now what will he like me for?

10:31.039 --> 10:33.599
Oh, God, Gregg's here.

10:33.609 --> 10:34.933
I'm sweating through my silk.

10:34.943 --> 10:36.702
Why didn't you let me Botox my pits?

10:36.712 --> 10:38.971
- This is the nightmare!
- Relax, this is good.

10:38.981 --> 10:42.007
We always put pheromones
into the air before a big date.

10:42.017 --> 10:45.677
It sets the mood. Go ahead.

10:45.687 --> 10:47.813
Let the 'mones out. You got it.

10:47.823 --> 10:49.615
Okay.

10:49.625 --> 10:51.392
- There you go, that's nice.
- You got it.

10:52.528 --> 10:55.098
Michael, phew, I wasn't sure
this was the right building.

10:55.109 --> 10:56.868
When I Googled the address,
it was just a bunch

10:56.879 --> 10:58.423
of bad reviews for a gym.

10:58.433 --> 11:00.270
- And this must be your dad.
- Hey.

11:00.281 --> 11:02.194
You said he was the
weird-looking one, right?

11:02.204 --> 11:04.463
Yes, he is, but I don't call him Dad.

11:04.473 --> 11:06.932
- I just call him...
- Mr. Cook, Gregg.

11:06.942 --> 11:08.934
And I'm uncle Mr. Cook, Gregg.

11:08.944 --> 11:10.769
Nice to meet you. I hope it's okay,

11:10.779 --> 11:13.071
but I brought dessert.
It's breadless bread pudding.

11:13.081 --> 11:15.003
Well, raised right. I like that, son.

11:15.014 --> 11:17.015
Oh, I'll take that, and
maybe just put the soufflé

11:17.026 --> 11:18.788
that I made in the garbage.
Does that work for everyone?

11:18.799 --> 11:20.712
Yes, that's fine. You know,
Gregg, we don't have

11:20.722 --> 11:22.814
to talk to them, I imagine
we just eat in silence

11:22.824 --> 11:24.516
on our phones like normal teens.

11:24.526 --> 11:27.286
Are you kidding?
I have so many questions.

11:27.296 --> 11:29.187
Like, how do two aging brothers

11:29.197 --> 11:30.767
put together a place this stylish?

11:30.778 --> 11:32.884
It's nice to finally have a
man with an eye in here.

11:32.895 --> 11:35.227
Everything you're looking at
is Tim Allen for Big Lots.

11:35.237 --> 11:37.162
- Phew. Yep.
- So, what are the kids

11:37.172 --> 11:40.098
drinking these days, Gregg?
Jager, Goldschlag, Tide pod?

11:40.108 --> 11:41.433
- Bloop.
- I actually have

11:41.443 --> 11:43.468
- a bottle of water in my bag.
- Oh, great.

11:43.478 --> 11:46.138
What else did you bring
that I'm already providing?

11:46.148 --> 11:47.915
Okay, let's eat.

11:48.884 --> 11:51.209
So, Gregg, what are your plans
for next year?

11:51.219 --> 11:52.610
Gregg's gonna try acting.

11:52.621 --> 11:54.305
He was worried there
weren't as many roles

11:54.316 --> 11:55.981
for white actors as there used to be,

11:55.991 --> 11:57.950
but then I laughed for 15 minutes.

11:57.960 --> 12:00.652
It's exciting, but not
as exciting as your news.

12:00.662 --> 12:02.454
Michael tells me
you're moving to Louisiana

12:02.464 --> 12:03.589
to manage a baseball team.

12:05.834 --> 12:07.926
- What?
- Oh, um, Gregg must have

12:07.936 --> 12:10.329
misheard me saying nothing about that.

12:10.339 --> 12:12.854
Yes, I misspoke. You see, I'm moving

12:12.865 --> 12:14.600
to Louisiana to manage a baseball team.

12:14.610 --> 12:17.018
- What?
- I beat Vince out for the job.

12:17.029 --> 12:18.612
That's where the confusion was.

12:18.623 --> 12:20.359
I'm sorry, but perhaps
you're all forgetting

12:20.370 --> 12:22.274
that you're speaking
to a high school graduate.

12:22.284 --> 12:24.209
Vince, what is going on?

12:26.488 --> 12:29.081
Look, Leo didn't give us
the loan for the expansion.

12:29.091 --> 12:30.916
- What?
- But there's a silver lining.

12:30.926 --> 12:33.227
For me. Um...

12:35.163 --> 12:38.991
Leo offered me a job managing
a baseball team in Baton Rouge.

12:39.001 --> 12:41.159
- And I accepted it.
- What?

12:41.169 --> 12:43.228
- How could you do this to me?
- Okay, you know what?

12:43.238 --> 12:45.063
- Maybe you should go.
- I said no at first,

12:45.073 --> 12:46.698
but then Michael
convinced me to take it.

12:46.708 --> 12:48.934
Excuse me, are there
tire marks on my back

12:48.944 --> 12:50.435
from being thrown under the bus?

12:50.445 --> 12:52.371
And I had to find out from Gregg?

12:52.381 --> 12:54.439
Who else knows? Alexa?

12:54.449 --> 12:55.984
<i>I'm sorry. I didn't quite get that.</i>

12:55.995 --> 12:57.275
<i>Do you want to know the weather?</i>

12:57.285 --> 12:59.211
Oh, I already know the weather, Alexa.

12:59.221 --> 13:01.213
It's a hurricane... of lies!

13:01.223 --> 13:02.914
- Whoa!
- No one else knows

13:02.924 --> 13:04.716
except my mom, okay?

13:04.726 --> 13:08.020
And I'm Facebook Live-ing this.
McKensie says Vince is a jerk.

13:08.030 --> 13:09.988
Well, tell her the job is seasonal.

13:09.998 --> 13:13.225
Okay, so I'll come and go,
like Santa and the McRib.

13:13.235 --> 13:15.994
- You love both of those things.
- How dare you compare yourself

13:16.004 --> 13:17.729
to such a jolly symbol of hope.

13:17.739 --> 13:19.807
- Or Santa!
- Cut it out!

13:21.710 --> 13:23.602
You killed him!

13:23.612 --> 13:27.039
Okay, uh, let's all just calm down.

13:27.049 --> 13:29.608
Okay, take some deep breaths,
and focus on the fact

13:29.618 --> 13:32.377
- that this is all Gregg's fault.
- Uh, what?

13:32.387 --> 13:34.946
Gregg, Gregg, Gregg!

13:34.956 --> 13:36.648
How dare you bring Gregg into this?

13:36.658 --> 13:38.583
That's my future nephew-in-law!

13:38.593 --> 13:40.819
- Help, help, hey, help, help!
- Do not help that man!

13:40.829 --> 13:42.754
He is a traitor to his family.

13:44.000 --> 13:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here

13:53.241 --> 13:55.701
- Say uncle!
- Never!

14:01.717 --> 14:03.108
You okay?

14:03.118 --> 14:04.943
Oh, my God.

14:04.953 --> 14:06.445
- Get off of me.
- I'm gonna put

14:06.455 --> 14:07.908
- my tongue in your ear.
- Be my guest!

14:07.919 --> 14:09.322
I haven't Q-tipped in a month!

14:09.333 --> 14:11.016
- Oh, come on, come on.
- Cut it, will you?

14:11.026 --> 14:14.653
Get up here. What is going on here?

14:14.663 --> 14:16.855
This is the lamest fight
I have ever seen,

14:16.865 --> 14:19.624
and I was a bouncer at
Senor Frog's for six years.

14:19.634 --> 14:21.321
You know, Matthew, most brothers our age

14:21.332 --> 14:23.661
only see each other at bachelor
parties and interventions.

14:23.672 --> 14:26.331
We can't do everything together forever.

14:26.341 --> 14:28.233
Yes, we can! I bought us a single

14:28.243 --> 14:31.203
burial plot that has bunk beds
and a trundle for Michael.

14:31.213 --> 14:33.338
But who cares?
You'd probably just abandon us

14:33.348 --> 14:35.407
for a job in hell, where I hope you rot!

14:35.417 --> 14:36.975
- What, that's it!
- Stop!

14:36.985 --> 14:38.844
Stop fighting. You're too old

14:38.854 --> 14:40.312
for your faces to heal properly.

14:40.322 --> 14:43.181
Now knock it off!

14:43.191 --> 14:44.950
Matthew, I'm sorry.

14:44.960 --> 14:47.018
But I need to take this managing job.

14:47.028 --> 14:49.755
I don't care. Just get out of here.

14:49.765 --> 14:52.733
And never come back.
I'll take care of Michael.

14:55.124 --> 14:57.441
Well, Vince, I hope you like
your going-away party.

14:57.452 --> 15:00.423
The theme is leftover
decorations from every holiday.

15:00.434 --> 15:03.660
Also, heads up, Shabaz insisted
we hire him as a mime.

15:03.662 --> 15:05.628
- Okay.
- Yeah.

15:05.630 --> 15:08.622
- Have you heard from Matthew?
- Well, actually, he texted me.

15:08.632 --> 15:11.425
Baseball emoji, eyeroll emoji. Ouch.

15:11.435 --> 15:14.428
Ugh, well, send him a
waving good-bye emoji, I guess.

15:14.438 --> 15:17.164
Hey, great party!

15:17.174 --> 15:18.999
Uh, Vince, do you have a second?

15:19.009 --> 15:20.394
- Yeah.
- Dana, it's a party.

15:20.405 --> 15:22.633
Don't bother Vince
with boring accounting stuff.

15:22.644 --> 15:24.104
Okay.

15:24.114 --> 15:27.908
Um, I was just gonna say
that I think it's very cool

15:27.918 --> 15:29.376
that you're following your dreams.

15:29.386 --> 15:33.781
And at the risk of
sounding unprofessional,

15:33.791 --> 15:35.816
good luck in the
upcoming fiscal quarter.

15:35.826 --> 15:37.618
Thank you.
That's very nice of you to say.

15:37.628 --> 15:39.720
I appreciate that. Oh, and if I ever

15:39.730 --> 15:41.121
finish your detective novel,

15:41.131 --> 15:42.823
I will be sure
and email you my thoughts.

15:42.833 --> 15:44.191
- Aw.
- But I like it, yeah.

15:44.201 --> 15:46.393
I like it.

15:46.403 --> 15:48.929
Well, I guess I will see you
out at the "par-tay."

15:48.939 --> 15:50.597
- Yes!
- Okay, hey, don't do anything

15:50.607 --> 15:52.366
I would do.

15:52.376 --> 15:54.368
Yes!

15:54.378 --> 15:56.971
- Oh, my God.
- What?

15:56.981 --> 15:58.973
Dana likes you.

15:58.983 --> 16:00.574
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

16:00.584 --> 16:01.942
Nah, come on.

16:01.952 --> 16:03.811
I mean, what would make you think that?

16:03.821 --> 16:05.579
Uh... no.

16:05.589 --> 16:07.514
And you like Dana?

16:07.524 --> 16:10.784
Ugh, you could not be leaving
at a better time.

16:10.794 --> 16:13.587
Okay, but I...

16:13.597 --> 16:15.222
Nah.

16:15.232 --> 16:17.257
Well, guys, almost time for me to go.

16:17.267 --> 16:19.126
As you know, I'm about to head out

16:19.136 --> 16:21.295
and do something that
I'm really excited about,

16:21.305 --> 16:23.030
which is a new feeling.

16:23.040 --> 16:24.698
I'm not used to things
working out for me,

16:24.708 --> 16:26.633
so I appreciate you guys supporting me.

16:26.643 --> 16:28.112
It's the right move for you, Vince.

16:28.123 --> 16:29.603
You can finally get into white women.

16:29.613 --> 16:32.172
And in Baton Rouge,
you'll be at least a six.

16:32.182 --> 16:33.841
At least.

16:33.851 --> 16:36.143
Aren't mimes not supposed to talk?

16:36.153 --> 16:38.912
Damn it, it's the one thing
I always forget.

16:38.922 --> 16:40.414
Yep.

16:40.424 --> 16:42.883
Which brings me to my brother, Matthew.

16:42.893 --> 16:44.885
As some of you know, we had a pretty

16:44.895 --> 16:47.755
- public fight the other day.
- Well, it's not a fight

16:47.765 --> 16:49.623
if one person just gets beat up.

16:49.633 --> 16:51.725
That's an ass-kicking.

16:51.735 --> 16:54.028
Anyway, the point is,
he's in charge now.

16:54.038 --> 16:55.662
And I would hope
you guys could treat him

16:55.672 --> 16:57.631
with more respect
than you treated me with.

16:59.643 --> 17:02.603
Well, looks like
my uberPOOL has arrived.

17:02.613 --> 17:04.505
So, just want to say one last thing.

17:04.515 --> 17:05.839
Um...

17:05.848 --> 17:09.343
- I'm gonna miss you guys.
- Aw, of course.

17:10.621 --> 17:12.445
Yeah.

17:12.455 --> 17:14.281
Ooh.

17:14.290 --> 17:15.949
I'm gonna miss you, too.

17:15.959 --> 17:18.018
I got you something for your nightstand.

17:18.028 --> 17:19.553
- Aw.
- I stole this frame

17:19.563 --> 17:21.655
from the living room.
I threw out that picture

17:21.665 --> 17:23.624
of that old, ugly man.

17:23.634 --> 17:26.560
- That was... that was my father.
- Oh, that's...

17:26.569 --> 17:28.695
But I love it. This is... this is great.

17:28.705 --> 17:31.098
Thank you. You see that?

17:31.108 --> 17:33.133
Okay, well...

17:34.478 --> 17:36.670
Nice.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.405
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go

17:38.415 --> 17:40.140
- manage a baseball team.
- All right, buddy.

17:40.150 --> 17:42.076
Go get 'em!

17:45.989 --> 17:47.848
Bye, Vince.

17:47.858 --> 17:50.317
Damn it, no talking, Shabaz! Jeez!

17:56.166 --> 17:58.759
Michael, your dinner's getting cold.

17:58.769 --> 18:01.795
Vince, if you can hear me
wherever you are, drop dead.

18:01.805 --> 18:03.197
I hope you're happy.

18:03.207 --> 18:04.798
Gregg doesn't want to see me again

18:04.808 --> 18:06.300
because we have too much family drama.

18:06.310 --> 18:07.901
And he's moving to LA

18:07.911 --> 18:09.870
to be on the family drama
"Family Drama"!

18:09.880 --> 18:11.317
Don't blame me. Blame Vince.

18:11.328 --> 18:13.817
He's the one who wanted to have it all.
Only women can do that.

18:13.828 --> 18:16.122
Matthew, you can't stay mad
at Vince forever.

18:16.133 --> 18:17.841
What happens
when he comes home in October?

18:17.852 --> 18:19.513
Uh, he won't be able to come inside

18:19.523 --> 18:21.615
- because I changed the locks.
- Look.

18:21.625 --> 18:23.575
Baseball is what Vince
has always wanted to do.

18:23.586 --> 18:25.953
That'd be like me telling you
you can't go to the aquarium

18:25.963 --> 18:27.294
and touch the stingrays anymore.

18:27.305 --> 18:29.560
Well, maybe if a baseball felt
anything like a stingray,

18:29.571 --> 18:31.624
that wouldn't be the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.

18:35.405 --> 18:36.670
Oh, God.

18:36.681 --> 18:38.732
Sounds like someone's
trying to break into my room.

18:42.679 --> 18:45.472
It's the Slender Man!

18:45.482 --> 18:48.008
Ow, mother(BLEEP)!

18:48.018 --> 18:49.610
Vince!

18:49.620 --> 18:51.945
Vince, I am so sorry, but why were you

18:51.955 --> 18:54.047
breaking into my window?
You know women stalk me.

18:54.057 --> 18:57.217
I tried the front door,
but you changed the locks.

18:57.227 --> 18:59.520
Okay, well, look at the bright side.

18:59.530 --> 19:01.622
The doctors were saying
had your penis been longer,

19:01.632 --> 19:03.123
you would have been in real trouble.

19:03.133 --> 19:05.125
What? No, I felt it.

19:05.135 --> 19:08.228
- It def grazed me.
- Vince, why did you come back?

19:08.238 --> 19:10.297
When I left, I said it was because

19:10.307 --> 19:11.765
the managing job meant that things

19:11.775 --> 19:13.167
were finally working out for me.

19:13.177 --> 19:15.936
But then I got down there,
and I realized

19:15.946 --> 19:18.839
that things were already working out.

19:18.849 --> 19:21.074
With you guys.

19:21.084 --> 19:24.611
- Even when I shot you?
- No, I hated that.

19:24.621 --> 19:27.581
But... I love all the other times.

19:28.962 --> 19:30.928
Sir, visiting hours are over.

19:30.939 --> 19:33.565
Your... assailants will have to leave.

19:33.576 --> 19:35.301
Oh, we're not just his assailants.

19:35.312 --> 19:37.107
He's my dad.

19:38.115 --> 19:39.540
Dad?

19:39.551 --> 19:41.176
You just called me Dad.

19:41.186 --> 19:44.079
Yeah, but let's not
make a whole meal out of it.

19:44.089 --> 19:46.415
Sir, is your assailant
pretending to be your son?

19:46.425 --> 19:49.803
- No, no, no, he is my son.
- I am.

19:51.063 --> 19:54.589
You see, 15 years ago, I made a choice,

19:54.599 --> 19:56.224
a choice that's haunted me

19:56.234 --> 19:58.694
- every waking...
- Sir, the Staten Island ferry

19:58.704 --> 20:00.195
just crashed into Chelsea Piers.

20:00.205 --> 20:02.464
- I don't have time for this.
- Yeah, hey, can you just

20:02.474 --> 20:04.132
give us a second? I'll donate blood.

20:04.142 --> 20:06.468
So, Michael.

20:06.478 --> 20:09.137
Notice you've been posting some
inspirational quotes on Insta.

20:09.147 --> 20:11.406
- Things okay with Gregg?
- I can't believe

20:11.416 --> 20:13.008
I'm saying this, but, who Gregg?

20:13.018 --> 20:15.811
Ah. Sorry, dog.

20:15.821 --> 20:18.747
But if it helps...

20:18.757 --> 20:20.816
I always thought he was
just a pretty face.

20:20.826 --> 20:23.618
But man, what a face.

20:23.628 --> 20:25.120
See, Matthew? That's how you

20:25.130 --> 20:26.455
make someone feel better.

20:26.465 --> 20:28.623
Shading the person that rejected you.

20:28.633 --> 20:30.392
No, I'm too nice to throw shade.

20:30.402 --> 20:32.394
Unless it's holding a parasol
over an old woman.

20:32.404 --> 20:34.096
Too nice? You just shot me.

20:34.106 --> 20:35.664
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

20:35.674 --> 20:38.467
So think about that
next time you try and leave.

20:38.477 --> 20:40.602
Well, I'm not going anywhere.
I got metal in my leg,

20:40.612 --> 20:43.171
so it'll be pretty hard
to get on an airplane.

20:43.181 --> 20:45.941
Hey, uh, that was here
when they wheeled me in.

20:45.951 --> 20:47.943
No way, how'd they know I like Jell-O?

20:47.953 --> 20:49.878
Oh, can we order nachos?

20:49.888 --> 20:52.347
<i>Ugh, that's not how a hospital works.</i>

20:52.357 --> 20:55.025
<i>Actually, I don't know that
for a fact, let's try.</i>
