25:16.253 --> 25:17.385
[lightning cracks]

25:27.482 --> 25:28.962
[shovel thuds]

25:44.760 --> 25:46.327
Hey.

25:46.370 --> 25:49.069
Okay, so as of now they got
the dogs searching the woods,

25:49.112 --> 25:50.766
but it looks like
she got away.

25:50.810 --> 25:53.813
Well, at least we know that
Katie's telling the truth.

25:53.856 --> 25:55.554
There is a Molly.

25:55.597 --> 25:57.904
Judging by the bite marks
on the mother's hand,

25:57.947 --> 25:59.383
clearly, she's
very real.

25:59.427 --> 26:01.647
So, what, she just sneaks
into people's houses

26:01.690 --> 26:05.215
and draws creepy pictures
of real-life crime scenes? Why?

26:08.044 --> 26:10.003
STEVE: Maybe the
kid can't speak.

26:10.046 --> 26:13.049
Maybe she was born that way

26:13.093 --> 26:14.616
or maybe from some
kind of trauma.

26:19.142 --> 26:21.754
What if this kid
knows so much about the murder

26:21.797 --> 26:23.320
because she was there?

26:23.364 --> 26:26.628
She's just trying to tell
the story the only way she can.

26:26.672 --> 26:28.151
Now listen to me,
there's a chance this girl

26:28.195 --> 26:30.066
knows who the killer is,
which means we need to find her

26:30.110 --> 26:31.154
and we need to find her
right now.

26:34.201 --> 26:37.073
I knew it. I was right.
Now they got to believe me.

26:41.861 --> 26:44.211
[lightning cracks]

27:00.836 --> 27:03.186
Take your time, Emily.
Whenever you're ready.

27:06.712 --> 27:08.452
It was early in the morning.

27:08.496 --> 27:10.977
I was leaving the Laundromat.

27:13.675 --> 27:16.156
[Molly crying]

27:20.116 --> 27:22.379
Hey, honey.

27:22.423 --> 27:24.207
Are you lost?

27:32.563 --> 27:33.826
I don't remember

27:33.869 --> 27:35.610
what happened after that.

27:35.654 --> 27:38.787
I must have managed
to flag down a car.

27:38.831 --> 27:42.269
The next morning I filed
a report, but it went nowhere.

27:42.312 --> 27:43.836
Well, not nowhere.

27:43.879 --> 27:47.187
That report is how
I found you.

27:47.230 --> 27:49.537
You really think the same man
that did this to me

27:49.580 --> 27:51.104
killed the girl
they found in the church?

27:51.147 --> 27:53.280
It's very possible.

27:53.323 --> 27:56.326
Like you, she was also

27:56.370 --> 27:59.286
injected with
ketamine.

27:59.329 --> 28:00.896
We also think
he might be

28:00.940 --> 28:03.464
targeting a certain type
of woman.

28:03.507 --> 28:06.206
Karen Miles also had red hair
and blue eyes.

28:06.249 --> 28:10.036
So if I hadn't gotten away...

28:10.079 --> 28:11.037
Hey.

28:11.080 --> 28:14.344
Emily, you did, you got away.

28:16.216 --> 28:17.347
GROVER:
Well, there's no denying it,

28:17.391 --> 28:19.785
these two women
look very similar.

28:19.828 --> 28:22.135
So either our perp has a thing
for blue-eyed redheads,

28:22.178 --> 28:23.223
or he's targeting these women

28:23.266 --> 28:24.790
because they remind him
of someone.

28:24.833 --> 28:27.140
Okay, Molly drew three pictures
all featuring

28:27.183 --> 28:28.184
a redheaded woman.

28:28.228 --> 28:29.620
Now so far,

28:29.664 --> 28:31.187
we've presumed
this is three drawings

28:31.231 --> 28:32.449
of the same incident,

28:32.493 --> 28:34.930
but what if they're
three different victims.

28:34.974 --> 28:36.845
If that's the case, then we're
looking for a serial killer.

28:36.889 --> 28:39.152
It's possible.
Lou, do me a favor.

28:39.195 --> 28:41.894
Search missing persons for
redheads who have gone missing

28:41.937 --> 28:43.983
in the last few years.

28:44.026 --> 28:45.854
Tani, I need you to go back
through Molly's drawings.

28:45.898 --> 28:47.769
See if you can find anything
at all that might help

28:47.813 --> 28:50.337
point us towards
potential burial sites.

28:50.380 --> 28:51.773
That means that this poor girl

28:51.817 --> 28:53.253
would've witnessed
three different murders?

28:53.296 --> 28:55.734
Yeah, I guess it does.

28:57.170 --> 28:58.780
How could we all lose our keys?

28:58.824 --> 29:00.564
The keys, anyone?

29:00.608 --> 29:02.044
CRYSTAL:
Looked here eight times.

29:03.045 --> 29:05.047
[screaming]

29:10.705 --> 29:12.185
Jerry?

29:12.228 --> 29:13.969
A-Are you okay? We were
really worried about you.

29:14.013 --> 29:17.538
Are you kidding?
I'm better than okay.

29:17.581 --> 29:18.800
Will you cut the crap

29:18.844 --> 29:20.541
and just tell us
where you put them.

29:20.584 --> 29:22.108
Put what?Look, Jerry.

29:22.151 --> 29:24.545
I've been a good sport
for the last three decades.

29:24.588 --> 29:26.373
Coming up here,
digging holes

29:26.416 --> 29:28.810
so you can live out some
stupid Hardy Boys fantasy.

29:28.854 --> 29:30.072
Ano, dial it back.

29:30.116 --> 29:33.293
No, no, no. But-but-but
keeping us hostage

29:33.336 --> 29:35.512
by taking our keys
and our phones?

29:35.556 --> 29:37.297
You've gone too far this time.

29:37.340 --> 29:38.472
What are you talking about?

29:38.515 --> 29:39.473
I didn't take your phones.
Why would I?

29:39.516 --> 29:42.041
To make us stay, Jerry.

29:42.084 --> 29:45.305
But I'm done. We all are.
It's over.

29:45.348 --> 29:49.178
You're right,
the search is over...

29:49.222 --> 29:52.181
'cause I found proof.

29:53.879 --> 29:55.881
This look like
a dog bone to you?

30:00.189 --> 30:02.017
Well?

30:02.061 --> 30:05.064
I mean, I have to take it
back to the lab to confirm,

30:05.107 --> 30:07.370
but this is a human femur.

30:08.937 --> 30:10.896
I'm sorry,

30:10.939 --> 30:14.203
but could you say that again,
only slower?

30:14.247 --> 30:17.206
It appears you've found
human remains.

30:20.557 --> 30:22.342
Booyah!

30:22.385 --> 30:24.257
Where did you
find this?

30:24.300 --> 30:26.346
Four feet under the dog bones.So the dead dog was
there to throw off

30:26.389 --> 30:27.651
the scent, just like you said.

30:27.695 --> 30:29.001
CRYSTAL:
You were right.

30:29.044 --> 30:31.351
You actually did it, Jerry.

30:34.310 --> 30:36.922
We need to get an
excavation team up here ASAP.

30:36.965 --> 30:38.227
ANO: Yeah, I hate
to change the subject,

30:38.271 --> 30:39.968
but at least one of us

30:40.012 --> 30:41.578
is gonna need our phones
in order to do that.

30:41.622 --> 30:43.232
Don't look at me.
I told you I didn't take them.

30:43.276 --> 30:44.277
Who did then?

30:44.320 --> 30:46.975
[loud banging]ERIC: Wait, wait.

30:47.019 --> 30:50.326
One... [mouthing]

30:50.370 --> 30:51.327
We're all here.

31:11.957 --> 31:13.436
[all screaming]

31:16.396 --> 31:19.268
Surprise, suckers! [laughs]

31:19.312 --> 31:21.183
When my heart starts
beating again,

31:21.227 --> 31:22.358
I'm gonna kill you.

31:22.402 --> 31:26.319
Aw, oh, look at your faces.
Priceless.

31:26.362 --> 31:28.451
Dude! Who the hell are you?

31:28.495 --> 31:31.628
Oh, Eric, Noelani,
this is Gordie.

31:31.672 --> 31:33.587
He-he was in our bunk, too.

31:33.630 --> 31:35.937
He usually comes up here
every year with us to dig,

31:35.981 --> 31:38.157
but he bailed 'cause
he had a conference.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.419
Oh, it wrapped early.

31:39.462 --> 31:41.029
Figured I'd come out
and surprise you guys,

31:41.073 --> 31:42.465
but by the time I got here,
you were already out digging.

31:42.509 --> 31:44.424
And then I remembered I had
this costume in my car

31:44.467 --> 31:46.382
from the office party
last night, and, well, you know,

31:46.426 --> 31:48.994
the whole "scaring the crap
out of you guys" thing

31:49.037 --> 31:52.519
just kind of snowballed
from there. [chuckles]

31:52.562 --> 31:54.738
Oh, come on, guys.

31:54.782 --> 31:58.090
Who can blame me for having
a little fun at your expense?

31:58.133 --> 31:59.961
I can.Yeah, me. I blame you.

32:00.005 --> 32:01.441
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

32:01.484 --> 32:03.138
It was you?

32:03.182 --> 32:04.618
You took our keys
and our phones?

32:04.661 --> 32:07.447
Yeah. Nice touch, right?

32:07.490 --> 32:09.014
No, I didn't.

32:09.057 --> 32:10.537
Yeah, I hated that.
Jerk.

32:10.580 --> 32:12.974
Fine. I stashed 'em
in the car.

32:13.018 --> 32:15.411
I'll go get them. Okay?

32:15.455 --> 32:18.675
All right? Just...
try to lighten up.

32:20.416 --> 32:22.418
ERIC: You're right,
he is a jerk.

32:22.462 --> 32:24.290
Sorry about that.

32:24.333 --> 32:25.465
Gordie's usually
a really good guy

32:25.508 --> 32:27.989
when he's not being
a total asshat!

32:28.033 --> 32:29.512
ERIC:
Yeah, well, Jer,

32:29.556 --> 32:31.688
I'm gonna have to take
your word for that one, pal.

32:31.732 --> 32:33.038
ANO:
Speaking of asshats...

32:35.083 --> 32:36.302
Dude...

32:36.345 --> 32:37.956
I'm sorry for doubting you

32:37.999 --> 32:39.609
and acting like a dick,

32:39.653 --> 32:41.960
and calling you crazy
and all that stuff.

32:45.137 --> 32:46.616
JERRY:
Past few years,

32:46.660 --> 32:48.836
I was even starting to think
I might be crazy myself.

32:51.186 --> 32:54.320
[choking]
JERRY:
Gordie?

32:54.363 --> 32:55.364
Not cool.

32:55.408 --> 32:57.149
It's not funny.
ERIC:
Come on.

32:57.192 --> 32:58.759
You guys are
so gullible.

32:58.802 --> 33:00.282
Oh, come on.

33:00.326 --> 33:01.718
I'm not even falling for that
a second time.

33:01.762 --> 33:04.243
Guys, this isn't a joke.
His throat's been slashed.

33:04.286 --> 33:06.680
What?It looks like they missed
the carotid artery,

33:06.723 --> 33:08.290
but he's still losing
blood rapidly.

33:08.334 --> 33:10.292
That's real blood?Yes! Clear!

33:10.336 --> 33:12.033
Come on, come on, get him on
the bed. Get him on the bed.

33:15.384 --> 33:17.865
Wait, that means...Somebody's out there.

33:17.908 --> 33:19.780
Only one person that could be.Bo.

33:19.823 --> 33:21.956
Jerry, the door!

33:23.566 --> 33:25.046
He must know
we found his victim.

33:25.090 --> 33:28.354
He's got no other choice
but to kill us all.

33:33.968 --> 33:35.709
We got to fortify
all these windows.

33:35.752 --> 33:36.797
ANO: Hurry! He's
trying to get in.

33:36.840 --> 33:39.539
I got this door.Pulse is fading.

33:39.582 --> 33:42.368
Stay with us, Gordie!Someone get the back door.

33:44.239 --> 33:46.328
[Noelani screams]

33:46.372 --> 33:49.157
[screaming]

33:51.203 --> 33:53.292
Crystal, help me move this.

34:04.433 --> 34:05.913
Maybe he gave up.

34:05.956 --> 34:07.349
Because axe-wielding maniacs

34:07.393 --> 34:09.438
have notoriously short
attention spans?

34:09.482 --> 34:10.874
He's plotting
his next move.

34:10.918 --> 34:12.789
What is he gonna do?
We got every way in sealed off.

34:12.833 --> 34:14.661
Eric, get me more towels.
I need to stem this bleeding.

34:14.704 --> 34:17.490
Is he gonna make it?I can stabilize him but we need

34:17.533 --> 34:18.621
to get him
to a hospital right now.

34:18.665 --> 34:20.362
Hey. Hey, hey.

34:20.406 --> 34:21.450
You smell that?

34:21.494 --> 34:22.669
Gasoline.

34:22.712 --> 34:24.192
He's trying to smoke us out.

34:24.236 --> 34:26.281
We leave, he's gonna
chop us to bits.

34:26.325 --> 34:28.283
Yeah, but if we stay,
then we're literally toast.

34:28.327 --> 34:30.329
That's why we need
to get out of here.

34:30.372 --> 34:32.766
I'll go out the front
and cause a diversion.

34:32.809 --> 34:34.768
You guys head out the back.ANO: Are you crazy?

34:34.811 --> 34:36.335
That door's on fire

34:36.378 --> 34:37.901
and there's an axe murderer
out there.

34:37.945 --> 34:39.773
I got us into this 30 years ago.
Now I'm gonna get us out.

34:39.816 --> 34:42.123
Aah!

34:44.169 --> 34:46.258
[gunshot][groans]

34:56.398 --> 34:58.270
Let's-let's put him
down right here.

35:04.189 --> 35:08.062
Uh, Bo Bradley's a lot younger
than I thought he'd be.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.411
That's not Bo Bradley.

35:09.455 --> 35:10.456
That's our old
camp counselor.

35:10.499 --> 35:12.501
CRYSTAL:
Blaine Morgan.

35:12.545 --> 35:14.024
ANO: He must've been
the one that Jerry saw

35:14.068 --> 35:15.504
with the axe that night.

35:15.548 --> 35:17.767
So Bo Bradley had nothing
to do with this after all?

35:17.811 --> 35:20.596
He just saved our lives.

35:21.815 --> 35:23.077
You guys all right?

35:23.121 --> 35:28.648
We will be now...
thanks to you, Mr. Bradley.

35:34.044 --> 35:37.613
Okay, so, HPD returned
Karen Miles's personal effects

35:37.657 --> 35:40.138
to the family today.
According to them,

35:40.181 --> 35:41.487
that crucifix necklace
that she was wearing,

35:41.530 --> 35:43.402
that didn't belong to her.
She was an atheist.

35:43.445 --> 35:45.969
So, I had the lab run it
for traces of DNA,

35:46.013 --> 35:47.797
see if they could get a hit.
They got a hit.

35:47.841 --> 35:52.280
Jane Martin. Arrested for
possession three years ago.

35:52.324 --> 35:54.456
Okay. Well,
we're not thinking that

35:54.500 --> 35:56.197
this Jane Martin
is our killer, are we?

35:56.241 --> 35:58.243
She looks like
one of the victims:

35:58.286 --> 35:59.461
red hair, blue eyes.

35:59.505 --> 36:00.593
TANI: Well, except that
she's still alive.

36:00.636 --> 36:01.681
Public records showing

36:01.724 --> 36:02.682
a current address

36:02.725 --> 36:04.510
in Minnesota.

36:04.553 --> 36:06.033
All right...

36:06.076 --> 36:07.339
Huh.

36:07.382 --> 36:09.297
She filed a petition for divorce

36:09.341 --> 36:11.473
from Dennis Coleman
two years ago.

36:12.996 --> 36:15.216
She was denied custody
of her daughter

36:15.260 --> 36:16.696
because of her drug history.

36:16.739 --> 36:18.393
Her daughter's name is Molly.

36:18.437 --> 36:19.699
STEVE:
Serial killers,

36:19.742 --> 36:21.440
they often leave a totem
on their victims, right?

36:21.483 --> 36:22.876
TANI:
And that's interesting

36:22.919 --> 36:24.138
because Molly's
other two drawings

36:24.182 --> 36:25.705
clearly show jewelry
on the bodies.

36:25.748 --> 36:28.490
Look at that.
That's-that's a bracelet.

36:28.534 --> 36:29.752
And this one

36:29.796 --> 36:32.015
is definitely, that's a ring.

36:32.059 --> 36:34.235
Okay. Maybe
Dennis Coleman's our guy

36:34.279 --> 36:36.498
and he's leaving his ex-wife's
jewelry on his victims.

36:36.542 --> 36:38.457
Got an address for this guy?

36:45.290 --> 36:47.292
Clear.

36:49.294 --> 36:53.515
Clear.Clear.

36:53.559 --> 36:55.735
Hey, hey, I got him.

36:55.778 --> 36:57.432
Hold it right there.

37:00.696 --> 37:02.916
Shh. He's sleeping.

37:02.959 --> 37:04.613
We good.

37:08.138 --> 37:10.140
[Molly crying]

37:17.278 --> 37:19.237
Come here.

37:22.283 --> 37:23.937
You're safe now, Molly.

37:49.223 --> 37:51.530
TANI: So, CSU exhumed
two more bodies.

37:51.573 --> 37:55.098
Locations match Molly's
two other drawings.

37:55.142 --> 37:57.666
Both were redheads, both were
wearing Jane Martin's jewelry.

37:57.710 --> 37:59.407
Well, it sounds like
Coleman lost his mind

37:59.451 --> 38:01.670
after his wife divorced him
and just took his rage out

38:01.714 --> 38:03.411
on any woman
who looked like her.

38:03.455 --> 38:05.892
I have come across
some sick individuals in my day,

38:05.935 --> 38:07.763
but to take this little girl

38:07.807 --> 38:10.853
and use her as part of your
twisted revenge fantasy?

38:10.897 --> 38:14.466
If there's a special place
in hell, boy, he's got
that all to himself.

38:14.509 --> 38:17.164
Yeah. Poor kid
never had a chance

38:17.207 --> 38:18.426
at a normal life--
no friends, no school.

38:18.470 --> 38:20.646
Well, at least she gets
to see her mom now.

38:20.689 --> 38:21.516
GROVER:
Well, where the hell

38:21.560 --> 38:22.996
has she been all this time?

38:23.039 --> 38:25.520
She was in rehab when
Coleman took off with Molly.

38:25.564 --> 38:26.782
She's now clean.

38:26.826 --> 38:28.654
Apparently, she's been
looking for her daughter

38:28.697 --> 38:30.046
ever since.

38:30.090 --> 38:32.527
She's actually on her way
right now.

38:32.571 --> 38:33.876
[sighs]:
Well, Tani...

38:33.920 --> 38:36.662
getting that DNA
off that necklace,

38:36.705 --> 38:38.228
that was a great move.

38:38.272 --> 38:41.362
If that kid's got any kind
of future in front of her,

38:41.406 --> 38:42.711
she owes it to you.

38:44.278 --> 38:45.497
He's right.

38:49.457 --> 38:51.198
Excuse me.

38:59.641 --> 39:01.904
[birds chirping]

39:07.257 --> 39:09.999
Mr. Bradley, hi.

39:10.043 --> 39:11.392
Uh...

39:11.436 --> 39:13.394
I just wanted to say thank you

39:13.438 --> 39:15.265
for saving our lives.

39:16.615 --> 39:18.660
I wasn't sure what you
get someone for that,

39:18.704 --> 39:21.315
but the store had
hot cocoa gift baskets,

39:21.359 --> 39:24.187
so I figured...
who doesn't like hot cocoa?

39:24.231 --> 39:26.712
You'd have to be crazy not to.

39:27.756 --> 39:30.368
BRADLEY:
So, tell me what happened.

39:30.411 --> 39:32.587
Well, Blaine Morgan
made it through surgery.

39:32.631 --> 39:34.763
HPD already has his confession.

39:34.807 --> 39:38.593
He admitted to abducting
Susanna Tumuro in 1982

39:38.637 --> 39:40.726
and burying her
near your property.

39:40.769 --> 39:44.947
He was trying to exhume the body
before developers found it,

39:44.991 --> 39:47.297
but had forgotten
the exact location.

39:47.341 --> 39:50.039
But then he saw us up there
and figured he'd sit back

39:50.083 --> 39:51.650
and let us do all the work.

39:51.693 --> 39:53.434
You know, Jerry, if
it wasn't for you,

39:53.478 --> 39:56.698
no one would've ever known
what happened to that girl.

39:56.742 --> 39:58.787
Well, I had help.

39:58.831 --> 40:00.963
And if it wasn't for you...

40:01.007 --> 40:02.965
me and all my friends
would be dead.

40:03.009 --> 40:05.228
I'm sorry, Mr. Bradley,

40:05.272 --> 40:07.274
for thinking you
had anything to do with this.

40:07.317 --> 40:09.972
Eh. I heard all
those stories.

40:10.016 --> 40:12.540
And I did nothing
to discourage 'em.

40:12.584 --> 40:14.150
In fact, I welcomed it.

40:14.194 --> 40:16.239
Kept campers
off my property.

40:16.283 --> 40:17.806
Most of the time.

40:17.850 --> 40:22.289
[chuckles] Do you know
I nearly caught a kid...

40:22.332 --> 40:25.510
who was hiding
in my living room once.

40:25.553 --> 40:27.163
What?

40:27.207 --> 40:29.035
That's crazy.

40:29.078 --> 40:30.602
Weird.

40:37.522 --> 40:38.740
Is that for me?

40:38.784 --> 40:39.785
Wow.

40:39.828 --> 40:41.743
That's beautiful.Well, thank you.

40:41.787 --> 40:43.963
Is this you?

40:44.006 --> 40:46.095
And who's this?It's you.

40:53.451 --> 40:54.930
[knocking]

40:56.628 --> 40:58.412
[clears throat]
Uh, Molly?

40:58.456 --> 41:00.545
Uh, someone's
here to see you.

41:07.726 --> 41:09.162
Mom?

41:10.206 --> 41:11.643
Yes, baby, it's me.

[phone vibrating]

41:23.132 --> 41:24.220
[beeps]

41:24.264 --> 41:25.657
Excuse me.

41:27.833 --> 41:29.399
♪

41:34.883 --> 41:36.537
Captain Keo.

41:36.581 --> 41:39.192
Hi. I wasn't sure
I was gonna hear from you.

41:39.235 --> 41:41.977
Well, this went against
my better judgment, believe me.

41:42.021 --> 41:43.805
But I ran the ballistics

41:43.849 --> 41:45.764
on the gun you gave me.

41:45.807 --> 41:47.896
Looks like your hunch was right.

41:47.940 --> 41:49.811
Um, it...

41:49.855 --> 41:51.726
it matched to an open case?

41:51.770 --> 41:52.988
That's right, homicide.

41:53.032 --> 41:54.686
Victim's name is

41:54.729 --> 41:55.991
Noriko Noshimuri.

41:56.035 --> 41:58.559
Listen, I got to ask.

41:58.603 --> 42:00.953
Is she any relation
to Adam Noshimuri

42:00.996 --> 42:02.998
who married
Officer Kono Kalakaua?

42:03.042 --> 42:05.044
[exhales]

42:05.087 --> 42:08.351
As far as I'm concerned, prison
would be letting her off easy.

42:08.395 --> 42:10.615
She deserves worse,
a lot worse.

42:10.658 --> 42:12.660
Yeah.

42:12.704 --> 42:14.662
I'm guessing by your reaction,

42:14.706 --> 42:16.664
that's not what
you wanted to hear.

42:16.708 --> 42:19.537
No, it wasn't.

42:19.580 --> 42:21.103
Captain Keo,
thank you for your help.

I really appreciate it.
