WEBVTT

01:21.040 --> 01:23.776
Nathan. Are you okay?

01:26.012 --> 01:27.446
Dad and I fought.

01:28.680 --> 01:30.014
Did he whip you?

01:32.584 --> 01:35.220
<i>No, he got tired.</i>

01:39.458 --> 01:41.226
and then he tried to find you...

01:43.628 --> 01:44.764
<i>...to say goodbye.</i>

01:46.933 --> 01:50.435
Oh... I was out
looking for my kingdom.

01:51.904 --> 01:53.436
What's that?

01:53.438 --> 01:55.742
It's where my thoughts
become real.

01:56.909 --> 01:58.410
What do you think about?

01:59.411 --> 02:03.379
I think about having
lots of different friends

02:03.381 --> 02:06.483
and having the power
to do whatever I want,

02:06.485 --> 02:07.754
like being a princess.

02:08.955 --> 02:10.087
I take all those thoughts

02:10.089 --> 02:11.423
and keep them safe
in my kingdom.

02:13.458 --> 02:14.524
<i>It's a special place.</i>

02:14.526 --> 02:16.561
<i>It's probably
somewhere near the mountains.</i>

02:22.334 --> 02:25.602
There is evil that wants
to destroy the kingdom,

02:25.604 --> 02:27.504
but as long as
we stick together,

02:27.506 --> 02:29.407
evil will not find it.

02:34.947 --> 02:38.050
<i>There is a kingdom
for every man, woman, and child.</i>

02:43.856 --> 02:46.556
<i>Doubts and fears
climb inside each of us</i>

02:46.558 --> 02:47.559
<i>to destroy it.</i>

02:55.734 --> 02:56.969
<i>There is a guardian.</i>

02:58.637 --> 03:02.407
<i>It guides us,
helps us to find our path.</i>

03:17.522 --> 03:18.557
<i>Laura,</i>

03:19.724 --> 03:21.359
do I have a kingdom?

03:22.962 --> 03:23.793
Yes.

03:23.795 --> 03:25.363
Will you help me find
my kingdom?

03:32.839 --> 03:34.939
I will never stop
looking for it.

03:34.941 --> 03:36.042
Promise?

03:40.545 --> 03:41.646
I promise.

03:46.785 --> 03:49.387
- You're brave, Laura.
- I know!

05:49.208 --> 05:51.776
Shh.

06:08.127 --> 06:10.495
Baby, let's take this back
to my place, okay?

06:12.999 --> 06:14.566
Hurry up, I don't have all day.

06:17.136 --> 06:19.269
This is not an accident.

06:19.271 --> 06:21.238
Put on some clothes, Nathan.

06:21.240 --> 06:24.041
You should
have been home yesterday.

06:24.043 --> 06:25.144
I hate you!

06:26.978 --> 06:28.245
Why is he here?

06:28.247 --> 06:31.848
I work my ass off
to make sure we pay the bills,

06:31.850 --> 06:34.186
to keep us
from living like this.

06:35.653 --> 06:37.720
You asshole!

06:37.722 --> 06:39.922
Hey, Laura, is everything okay?

06:39.924 --> 06:42.159
Nathan! Oh my God! Nathan, stop.

06:42.161 --> 06:43.227
Make him stop!
Get him off of me.

06:43.229 --> 06:45.697
- Get him off of me.
- What are you doing?

06:48.633 --> 06:51.070
Stop laughing,
you're a grown man.

06:52.238 --> 06:53.337
You know that's it.

06:53.339 --> 06:55.905
I'm disappearing now
and you'll never see me again.

06:55.907 --> 06:57.074
Where are you going?

06:57.076 --> 06:59.642
- I'm stepping out of this hell.
- I'm coming with you.

06:59.644 --> 07:03.679
No, you're staying here
and cleaning up this mess.

07:26.971 --> 07:27.906
Okay.

07:29.408 --> 07:31.177
Let's first go over the facts.

07:32.710 --> 07:34.180
Nathan is autistic

07:35.081 --> 07:36.846
and I am supposed to evaluate

07:36.848 --> 07:39.251
whether you, Laura,
are capable of caring for him.

07:41.719 --> 07:44.221
This is my fifth visit
this month,

07:44.223 --> 07:46.823
nonetheless, I am supposed
to give each of you

07:46.825 --> 07:47.990
the benefit of the doubt

07:47.992 --> 07:51.295
and write a report before
any final decisions are made.

07:51.297 --> 07:52.429
Stop.

07:52.431 --> 07:54.366
So, who wants to go first?

07:56.368 --> 07:57.303
Nathan...

08:00.972 --> 08:03.407
How do you feel about Laura?

08:03.409 --> 08:05.007
Is she your friend?

08:05.009 --> 08:06.212
No, she's not.

08:11.117 --> 08:12.384
She's my little sister.

08:13.285 --> 08:15.254
That's more important to me
than friendship.

08:30.768 --> 08:32.336
What's going on with you?

08:32.338 --> 08:34.138
The only reason you're here

08:34.140 --> 08:36.708
is because Nathan got upset
that I left him home alone.

08:37.443 --> 08:39.809
I tried to explain to him
that he's a grown man

08:39.811 --> 08:41.878
and he needs
to start acting like one.

08:41.880 --> 08:44.150
You might be asking Nathan
for the impossible.

08:47.085 --> 08:48.985
What if I said to you,

08:48.987 --> 08:50.820
"Laura, you are a grown woman

08:50.822 --> 08:52.158
and you need
to start acting like one."

08:54.160 --> 08:55.827
What would you do differently?

08:59.398 --> 09:01.032
I need to go to work.

09:05.970 --> 09:08.004
Think about what you want to do
and make a decision

09:08.006 --> 09:10.474
before he
or someone around him gets hurt.

09:10.476 --> 09:13.075
- State law requires...
- State law?

09:13.077 --> 09:15.044
Nathan and I have been together
our whole lives.

09:15.046 --> 09:16.746
I'm not surrendering him.

09:16.748 --> 09:18.482
State Law requires
that we follow up

09:18.484 --> 09:20.384
to see what immediate changes
you are making

09:20.386 --> 09:21.886
to better accommodate Nathan.

09:24.323 --> 09:26.290
And if something like this
happens again?

09:26.292 --> 09:28.726
You may lose whatever custody
you think you have of him.

09:29.994 --> 09:31.328
For his safety

09:31.330 --> 09:34.799
and anyone he hurts,
you're liable for that.

09:35.800 --> 09:37.800
Here's another one of these
and my card.

09:37.802 --> 09:40.036
You need to contact me
within two days

09:40.038 --> 09:42.374
and use those two days
to get yourself together.

10:00.959 --> 10:02.894
Something on your mind, Laura?

10:04.896 --> 10:07.331
She told me
I can't let you out of my sight.

10:07.333 --> 10:08.733
Do you know what that means?

10:09.801 --> 10:11.568
It means
that we get to be together.

10:11.570 --> 10:13.339
It means I can't go to work.

10:15.073 --> 10:16.140
Take me with you.

10:19.411 --> 10:21.177
I need you to promise me

10:21.179 --> 10:23.081
that you will never flip out
like that again.

10:24.383 --> 10:25.817
- I promise.
- Again.

10:27.051 --> 10:28.318
- I promise.
- Again.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.820
I need to know that you
understand what I am telling you.

10:30.822 --> 10:31.624
I promise.

10:32.591 --> 10:34.491
Because if you don't keep
your promise

10:34.493 --> 10:37.059
that bitch social worker
is going to take you away

10:37.061 --> 10:38.763
and you'll never see me again.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.100
I really messed
up this time, Laura.

10:44.102 --> 10:45.271
I'm sorry.

10:50.041 --> 10:52.576
Just listen to what
I'm telling you. It's easy.

10:55.314 --> 10:57.148
<i>Do you remember
the rules about the truck?</i>

10:58.850 --> 10:59.782
<i>Don't...</i>

10:59.784 --> 11:00.717
<i>Don't play
with the gears,</i>

11:00.719 --> 11:03.154
<i>don't honk the horn,
and most of all...</i>

11:05.023 --> 11:06.989
<i>Don't leave the truck.</i>

11:06.991 --> 11:08.826
Never <i>leave the truck.</i>

11:33.452 --> 11:35.385
<i>Just draw in your book
or something.</i>

11:35.387 --> 11:36.888
<i>I'll be back as soon as I can.</i>

12:05.451 --> 12:08.019
Hey, man.
What are you doing up there?

12:15.193 --> 12:16.060
- Shit!
- Ah!

12:35.012 --> 12:35.878
<i>All right, everybody.</i>

12:35.880 --> 12:38.013
Ten minutes
to the curtain, let's go!

12:38.015 --> 12:39.115
You guys, this is it.

12:39.117 --> 12:40.983
Eight months
we've been doing this,

12:40.985 --> 12:42.586
it's time for the big payoff,
you guys.

12:42.588 --> 12:44.954
First impressions
are the only impressions.

12:44.956 --> 12:49.327
I guarantee you, you guys will go
someplace if you bring your game.

12:51.697 --> 12:55.297
<i>You should have let that
social worker arrest him or something.</i>

12:55.299 --> 12:57.467
<i>You obviously
don't get it.</i>

12:57.469 --> 13:00.236
<i>People have been abandoning
Nathan and I our whole lives.</i>

13:00.238 --> 13:02.073
<i>I'm not gonna do
the same to him.</i>

13:03.174 --> 13:05.040
So, life's hard.

13:05.042 --> 13:06.976
We made it this far.
We keep going.

13:06.978 --> 13:08.512
Make sure
you bring it tonight

13:08.514 --> 13:10.045
like you've never
bought it before.

13:10.047 --> 13:13.082
This is where we get paid.

13:13.084 --> 13:15.552
- He's dangerous.
- He's not dangerous.

13:15.554 --> 13:17.754
You just don't know him
like I do.

13:17.756 --> 13:20.091
He's got a lot going on in
his head. He can be sensitive.

13:24.395 --> 13:27.096
I have to believe
that things will get better.

13:27.098 --> 13:32.034
Somebody is going somewhere far
from this performance tonight.

13:32.036 --> 13:34.138
Less than ten,
everybody, let's go.

13:35.373 --> 13:36.575
I need your support.

13:43.014 --> 13:43.715
Hello.

13:44.750 --> 13:45.717
Who is this?

13:46.785 --> 13:49.586
No, no, no. Listen,
this is a misunderstanding.

13:49.588 --> 13:51.521
There is no way that guy
is my brother.

13:51.523 --> 13:54.125
I don't know how he got
my name and number.

13:56.462 --> 13:58.662
My brother is right here
waiting for me.

13:58.664 --> 14:00.599
So, whoever this is,
you're full of...

14:01.500 --> 14:02.468
Shit!

14:04.536 --> 14:06.435
My brother
got into some trouble.

14:06.437 --> 14:08.574
I need to pick him up right now,
or he's gonna get arrested.

14:09.641 --> 14:11.073
You can't go anywhere.

14:11.075 --> 14:14.744
Listen, doesn't he have like a safe
place he can go to or something?

14:14.746 --> 14:17.079
It should only take a couple
of minutes. I'll be right back.

14:19.116 --> 14:22.318
- You know her lines, right?
- Yeah, inside and out.

14:22.320 --> 14:25.789
Look, if you leave,
don't come back.

14:25.791 --> 14:27.691
All right, everybody,
it's showtime.

14:27.693 --> 14:29.360
I need everybody
in their places.

14:53.719 --> 14:54.686
Excuse me.

14:57.689 --> 14:59.691
I don't really think you know
what you're doing.

15:02.426 --> 15:04.293
- I think he needs special care.
- Yeah?

15:04.295 --> 15:05.797
I'll keep that in mind.

15:09.133 --> 15:09.801
I hope so.

15:11.703 --> 15:13.437
I'm erasing you from my life.

15:16.842 --> 15:17.809
What does that mean?

15:19.110 --> 15:21.747
- Nothing.
- Where are we going?

15:23.314 --> 15:24.448
Where do you want to go?

15:25.383 --> 15:27.182
That's a funny question.

15:27.184 --> 15:30.119
You're always in control,
so, I'll ask you again.

15:30.121 --> 15:31.855
Where do you want to go?

15:31.857 --> 15:32.824
It's your night, Nathan.

15:36.427 --> 15:39.497
- Any... where?
- Yes, anywhere.

15:41.833 --> 15:46.368
I... I just want to go home.

15:46.370 --> 15:47.371
Take me home.

15:48.907 --> 15:49.808
Okay.

15:52.376 --> 15:53.377
I can do that.

16:13.331 --> 16:14.565
We're a family, right?

16:15.934 --> 16:17.501
Yeah, we're a family.

16:18.536 --> 16:21.738
You need a big brother
to protect you, right?

16:21.740 --> 16:24.674
I have a big brother,
but I can take care of myself

16:24.676 --> 16:27.343
and you can take care
of yourself, too.

16:27.345 --> 16:29.445
You know, I'm gonna ask you
again and this time tell me

16:29.447 --> 16:31.382
what were you doing
on top of that house?

16:32.684 --> 16:33.852
I was looking.

16:35.386 --> 16:36.788
I want to find the kingdom.

16:38.422 --> 16:42.226
This will solve everything
with us and the social worker.

16:46.197 --> 16:48.132
I told you not to go
through my stuff.

16:50.501 --> 16:52.234
I wasn't gonna keep it.

16:52.236 --> 16:53.170
I promise.

16:56.407 --> 16:57.573
In the kingdom,

16:57.575 --> 17:02.712
no one ever gets sick, or hurt,
or ever feels scared.

17:02.714 --> 17:04.916
It's never cold, or too hot,

17:05.984 --> 17:07.651
and it never gets dark,

17:07.653 --> 17:11.220
so we can play there
as much as we want

17:11.222 --> 17:12.689
without worrying.

17:12.691 --> 17:14.760
Sounds too good
to be true, Nathan.

17:16.460 --> 17:19.397
No one ever feels lonely
in the kingdom.

17:20.398 --> 17:21.733
We'll be happy there.

17:22.968 --> 17:24.268
It's perfect.

17:25.771 --> 17:29.238
Can I count on you to have your stuff
all packed up before you go to bed?

17:29.240 --> 17:30.341
Are we going on a trip?

17:32.711 --> 17:33.577
Yeah.

17:41.285 --> 17:42.219
Are you happy?

17:43.654 --> 17:44.622
I will be.

17:45.791 --> 17:47.425
Yeah, me, too.

19:04.035 --> 19:05.503
You want some breakfast?

19:06.805 --> 19:07.839
Yeah.

19:24.022 --> 19:27.793
Hey, listen, there's some things
we got to figure out today.

19:33.832 --> 19:34.833
Excuse me.

19:40.371 --> 19:41.039
Thanks.

19:46.744 --> 19:48.880
Hey, you want the usual?

20:08.632 --> 20:09.500
Laura.

20:11.769 --> 20:13.604
Laura, look at me.

20:15.506 --> 20:19.008
I said look at me.
I need you to look at me.

20:33.925 --> 20:34.893
We'll make it.

20:37.528 --> 20:40.431
We're going
to the Red Rocks together.

20:42.033 --> 20:45.134
That's where we are going
to find the kingdom.

20:45.136 --> 20:46.568
Please.

20:46.570 --> 20:48.706
Nathan, open the door.

20:50.108 --> 20:52.643
I can't help you two
if you don't open this door.

20:54.880 --> 20:57.148
I don't see
a better alternative.

20:58.782 --> 21:01.685
We can find it... together.

21:25.809 --> 21:27.913
<i>There are voices
at times when I'm alone.</i>

21:28.980 --> 21:31.713
<i>I like thinking it's the wind.</i>

21:31.715 --> 21:34.183
<i>Nathan told me
it was so quiet one night</i>

21:34.185 --> 21:36.487
<i>that he could hear
the air whisper.</i>

21:37.222 --> 21:38.689
<i>I remember that night.</i>

21:40.959 --> 21:42.559
<i>It was much quieter.</i>

21:57.775 --> 21:59.675
What are you doing?

21:59.677 --> 22:01.947
I want you to hear what
the night and wind are up to.

22:03.181 --> 22:05.014
They're playing.

22:05.016 --> 22:06.483
Listen, Laura.

22:13.291 --> 22:16.292
<i>All I could hear
was my breathing coming back.</i>

22:33.944 --> 22:35.612
<i>Do you believe
that angels exist?</i>

22:36.714 --> 22:38.181
Look at me.

22:38.183 --> 22:40.582
This is very important.

22:40.584 --> 22:43.286
I need to know that you
still believe angels exist.

22:43.288 --> 22:45.889
- I do. I believe angels exist.
- Good.

22:50.928 --> 22:53.164
It's necessary
for finding the kingdom.

23:00.771 --> 23:03.039
That's so sad.
What happened?

23:03.041 --> 23:04.940
He is the guardian angel

23:04.942 --> 23:07.310
who once protected the kingdom.

23:07.312 --> 23:09.212
Before there was ever a kingdom,

23:09.214 --> 23:13.717
an Evil Condor reigned terror
over these lands.

23:15.886 --> 23:18.887
<i>The Evil Condor
sought to align his blood</i>

23:18.889 --> 23:20.624
<i>with the world he conquered.</i>

23:25.596 --> 23:28.932
<i>and compelled the most
beautiful angel to marry him.</i>

23:29.900 --> 23:33.369
<i>Astounded by the love he felt
for his wife and unborn child,</i>

23:33.371 --> 23:35.871
<i>he considered ending his war.</i>

23:35.873 --> 23:37.739
<i>But the angel was afraid.</i>

23:37.741 --> 23:41.110
<i>She did not want her baby to
be born into a world of hatred.</i>

23:41.112 --> 23:45.714
<i>So, she fell and gave birth
to the Condor Angel,</i>

23:45.716 --> 23:47.383
<i>a creature with great strength</i>

23:47.385 --> 23:50.752
<i>of the virtuous likeness
of an angel.</i>

23:50.754 --> 23:53.889
<i>She spread her wings
over her newborn son</i>

23:53.891 --> 23:55.991
and became a tree.

23:55.993 --> 23:58.094
The Evil Condor felt betrayed.

23:58.096 --> 23:59.795
He wanted revenge.

23:59.797 --> 24:01.997
And this baby just magically
survived on its own?

24:01.999 --> 24:05.236
She broke his beak off
to conceal his identity.

24:06.304 --> 24:08.837
<i>His mother, this tree,</i>

24:08.839 --> 24:12.743
<i>stuck her roots into the
Condor Angel and fed him.</i>

24:14.912 --> 24:16.412
<i>It was his pain to bear</i>

24:16.414 --> 24:18.980
<i>for being given a chance
to live freely.</i>

24:20.351 --> 24:21.752
This is wicked good, Nathan.

24:23.020 --> 24:24.753
Nine hundred years later,

24:24.755 --> 24:29.125
the Condor Angel fell in love
with a native princess,

24:29.127 --> 24:31.427
<i>Princess A'hioka.</i>

24:35.100 --> 24:37.699
<i>The chief,
father to the princess,</i>

24:37.701 --> 24:41.672
<i>told the Condor Angel that
his appearance had a purpose.</i>

24:44.041 --> 24:48.344
<i>He instructed the Condor Angel
to guard what he then called...</i>

24:48.346 --> 24:49.280
<i>the kingdom.</i>

24:53.851 --> 24:58.189
<i>The princess and Condor Angel
married and had a son,</i>

24:59.157 --> 25:02.858
<i>but the Evil Condor
learned of the angel's family</i>

25:02.860 --> 25:04.928
and promised to kill their son.

25:07.432 --> 25:09.367
<i>There was a final fight
between them.</i>

25:12.803 --> 25:14.272
<i>but the Evil Condor...</i>

25:15.839 --> 25:17.142
<i>was too strong.</i>

25:21.379 --> 25:22.380
<i>The angel fell...</i>

25:23.881 --> 25:26.184
<i>leaving his son defenseless</i>

25:27.152 --> 25:30.018
with no one
to stand in evils way.

25:30.020 --> 25:32.488
The Condor Angel's son
had to escape

25:32.490 --> 25:34.159
and go into hiding.

25:35.393 --> 25:37.160
Now,

25:37.162 --> 25:41.863
<i>the angel must find his son
before the Evil Condor does.</i>

25:41.865 --> 25:44.435
<i>What happens if the
Evil Condor finds the kid first?</i>

25:46.003 --> 25:47.170
- Why would you say that?
- Get off of me!

25:47.172 --> 25:48.737
- Why?
- Get off of me!

25:48.739 --> 25:51.307
Nathan, stop.

25:51.309 --> 25:53.942
Damn it!

25:53.944 --> 25:55.112
Holy shit, Nathan!

26:01.885 --> 26:05.423
I keep the Evil Condor here.

26:08.091 --> 26:12.160
It's absolutely
the most powerful monster

26:12.162 --> 26:13.897
anyone has ever faced.

26:15.065 --> 26:18.936
I don't know how long I can
keep him locked away like this.

26:34.352 --> 26:37.386
<i>I really believe
Nathan's stories are metaphors.</i>

26:37.388 --> 26:41.823
<i>Each character represents
the love, fight, hate,</i>

26:41.825 --> 26:43.961
<i>and struggles
we've been through in our past.</i>

26:45.363 --> 26:48.497
<i>He's adopted
these guys as his family.</i>

26:48.499 --> 26:51.132
<i>The Condor Angel
is his adopted father</i>

26:51.134 --> 26:52.368
<i>and guardian angel.</i>

26:52.370 --> 26:55.937
<i>And the Condor Angel's son
is his adopted little brother</i>

26:55.939 --> 26:57.172
<i>that he can watch over,</i>

26:57.174 --> 27:00.110
<i>the way he wishes he could
have watched over me growing up.</i>

27:08.453 --> 27:09.318
Let me out here.

27:09.320 --> 27:12.120
- Right here, right now.
- Just wait.

27:12.122 --> 27:13.855
I need to find
someplace to park.

27:13.857 --> 27:16.057
It's a desert
with miles of parking.

27:16.059 --> 27:17.328
Stop!

27:20.265 --> 27:21.164
Well?

27:31.342 --> 27:34.177
This is awesome! Woo!

27:35.446 --> 27:36.314
Yeah!

27:40.318 --> 27:41.486
Yeah!

27:57.868 --> 27:59.435
Laura!

27:59.437 --> 28:01.136
Hurry!

28:01.138 --> 28:02.873
Bring my book!

28:04.409 --> 28:05.476
Come on!

28:08.945 --> 28:09.913
Come on!

28:18.021 --> 28:19.424
It's so beautiful.

28:37.542 --> 28:39.477
We must be
at the gates to the kingdom.

28:41.546 --> 28:43.046
We have to explore.

28:48.118 --> 28:49.452
I am not wearing this.

28:49.454 --> 28:51.587
It's part of the costume.

28:51.589 --> 28:53.254
What did you make this
out of again?

28:53.256 --> 28:55.058
Dumpster boxes and stuff.

28:57.327 --> 28:58.862
You'll have to catch me.

28:59.664 --> 29:00.964
Laura, wait up!

29:07.438 --> 29:09.605
What part of the world
do you call this, Spirit Wing?

29:09.607 --> 29:11.239
It's very strange.

29:11.241 --> 29:12.375
Young Huntress,

29:12.377 --> 29:15.411
we have passed through the gates
into a nameless world

29:15.413 --> 29:18.514
where hungry creatures have not
enjoyed the taste of meat

29:18.516 --> 29:21.349
for a very long time.

29:21.351 --> 29:24.152
I'll take the first look
over this ridge.

29:24.154 --> 29:25.186
Stay close.

29:25.188 --> 29:27.322
<i>When we play pretend,</i>

29:27.324 --> 29:30.959
<i>I have him chase me sometimes
hoping that I can get us lost,</i>

29:30.961 --> 29:34.432
<i>far enough away to forget all
the bad stuff we have in common.</i>

29:37.502 --> 29:40.203
<i>I don't blame him
for wanting to escape reality.</i>

29:41.606 --> 29:44.372
<i>Being numb, playing pretend,</i>

29:44.374 --> 29:47.510
<i>what's the difference
as long as you can get away.</i>

29:47.512 --> 29:50.078
Spirit Wing,
this area is clear,

29:50.080 --> 29:52.615
but I fear that we
may venture too far.

29:52.617 --> 29:56.384
The sun is growing weak and your
powers will soon be swallowed by nightfall.

29:56.386 --> 29:59.154
We should venture
just a little bit more,

29:59.156 --> 30:02.023
so we may expand
our knowledge of these lands

30:02.025 --> 30:04.094
and share our findings
with the kingdom.

30:06.363 --> 30:08.531
I'm thirsty.
I think we should head back.

30:08.533 --> 30:10.298
Nonsense, Young Huntress.

30:10.300 --> 30:12.703
I will fetch you the bag
and get you water.

30:47.805 --> 30:50.073
Laura!

30:51.809 --> 30:53.210
He escaped!

30:54.712 --> 30:57.515
Laura, help! He escaped!

31:05.055 --> 31:06.289
I'm not afraid of you.

31:07.558 --> 31:10.393
You must have heard us talking
about the Condor Angel's son,

31:11.394 --> 31:12.795
but you'll never find him

31:12.797 --> 31:15.163
because I hid him from you.

31:15.165 --> 31:16.601
I hid him from you!

31:21.572 --> 31:22.838
Laura!

31:22.840 --> 31:24.773
Where are you?

31:24.775 --> 31:28.142
Laura, where are you?

31:34.384 --> 31:35.318
That's it.

31:36.554 --> 31:39.289
I'm just gonna let
the social worker take you.

31:40.691 --> 31:42.558
Dumbass!

31:42.560 --> 31:45.794
You promised
never to play like this.

31:45.796 --> 31:48.666
The social worker bitch
said we have to stick together.

31:51.234 --> 31:52.402
Nathan!

31:53.871 --> 31:55.606
Where the hell are you?

32:13.223 --> 32:14.124
Nathan?

32:15.292 --> 32:17.693
Nathan! Nathan!

32:17.695 --> 32:19.260
Nathan!

32:19.262 --> 32:20.530
Oh, my God! Nathan!

32:22.198 --> 32:24.232
Nathan! Nathan!

32:24.234 --> 32:26.902
Nathan! Wake up!

32:26.904 --> 32:27.805
Wake up.

32:29.239 --> 32:30.573
Nathan!

32:30.575 --> 32:32.741
Nathan, please, just wake up!

32:32.743 --> 32:34.309
Nathan...

32:34.311 --> 32:35.644
Help over here!

32:35.646 --> 32:38.479
Someone, come on! Help!

32:38.481 --> 32:40.283
Someone help me!

32:42.587 --> 32:44.587
Someone, please...

32:44.589 --> 32:46.722
What the hell
is going on in there?

32:46.724 --> 32:48.726
Hey, we hear you.

32:49.794 --> 32:53.561
- Hey!
- Help... Help!

32:53.563 --> 32:54.562
Please, help!

32:54.564 --> 32:56.197
I think it's coming
from over there.

32:56.199 --> 32:57.434
Over here!

32:59.804 --> 33:02.671
Hey how's he doing? Did he fall?

33:02.673 --> 33:05.206
- What happened?
- I don't know.

33:05.208 --> 33:07.177
- He looks really bad.
- Yep.

33:08.244 --> 33:10.244
Jesus Christ!
How long has he been like this?

33:10.246 --> 33:11.816
I don't know
maybe a couple minutes.

33:12.783 --> 33:15.550
- No visible head trauma.
- Nathan.

33:17.220 --> 33:18.321
Nathan, wake up.

33:19.757 --> 33:21.322
There's no pulse.

33:21.324 --> 33:22.658
What?

33:22.660 --> 33:24.893
- Well, do something!
- Okay...

33:24.895 --> 33:26.862
All right!

33:26.864 --> 33:28.563
Back... back up. All right.

33:28.565 --> 33:30.264
Lower his head.

33:30.266 --> 33:33.468
Nathan, wake up.

33:33.470 --> 33:34.772
Come on, Nathan.

33:36.239 --> 33:38.239
Just please, don't let him die.

33:38.241 --> 33:40.608
Please.

33:40.610 --> 33:42.243
There's nothing. Shit!

33:42.245 --> 33:45.346
Okay, Nathan,
you can breathe, man.

33:45.348 --> 33:46.347
Come on!

33:46.349 --> 33:47.615
Wake up, man!

33:47.617 --> 33:48.884
- Nathan!
- Just breathe, goddamn it!

33:48.886 --> 33:50.753
Breathe!

33:50.755 --> 33:52.921
Oh, my God. Nathan.

33:52.923 --> 33:53.856
Thank God.

33:53.858 --> 33:54.757
Let go!

33:54.759 --> 33:56.593
- Get off of me.
- Nathan. It's just me.

33:58.361 --> 34:00.829
The Evil Condor
tried to kill me.

34:00.831 --> 34:02.700
I know it was you
who let him out.

34:04.334 --> 34:06.401
You want me dead.

34:06.403 --> 34:08.403
Nathan, stop with that shit.

34:08.405 --> 34:10.338
He needs to get to a hospital.

34:10.340 --> 34:13.942
I don't need to go
to some stupid hospital.

34:13.944 --> 34:14.912
I'm fine.

34:16.747 --> 34:18.847
He was dead just a moment ago.

34:18.849 --> 34:21.282
I don't know what to tell you.

34:21.284 --> 34:22.185
Thanks.

34:28.693 --> 34:29.626
You okay?

34:31.561 --> 34:32.930
No goddamn sense.

34:33.864 --> 34:35.231
Yeah, I saw that, too.

35:33.389 --> 35:34.757
Oh, my God, Nathan!

35:34.759 --> 35:38.359
I have to make sure that nothing
like this ever happens again.

35:38.361 --> 35:39.260
It wouldn't have happened

35:39.262 --> 35:41.662
if you had left
the Evil Condor alone

35:41.664 --> 35:43.999
and didn't help him escape.

35:44.001 --> 35:44.869
Bitch!

35:47.805 --> 35:49.305
Who am I to you?

35:51.008 --> 35:53.474
Because last time I checked,
I'm all you got.

35:53.476 --> 35:55.246
- Honestly?
- Yeah, honestly.

35:56.881 --> 35:58.646
You're a nobody.

35:58.648 --> 36:01.018
You're nothing.
Your life is meaningless.

36:03.954 --> 36:06.289
I am not helping you.

36:07.590 --> 36:08.893
I'm done.

36:10.795 --> 36:11.728
We are done.

36:23.473 --> 36:26.877
Nathan! Nathan!

36:41.491 --> 36:43.558
I'm so tired of this shit.

36:43.560 --> 36:44.895
I'm gonna kick your ass.

36:45.863 --> 36:48.130
Hi, I am the guy from yesterday.

36:48.132 --> 36:49.399
What do you want?

36:54.637 --> 36:56.040
- What?
- How you doing?

36:57.074 --> 36:57.942
Why?

36:58.976 --> 37:00.508
Your brother's missing.

37:02.579 --> 37:03.479
Really?

37:16.793 --> 37:17.995
My name is Jimmy.

37:19.829 --> 37:20.697
Laura.

37:21.764 --> 37:24.166
I heard you yelling Nathan
last night from our camp.

37:24.168 --> 37:25.934
That's us right there.

37:25.936 --> 37:27.870
So, I thought
I'd help you find him now.

37:27.872 --> 37:29.770
Why didn't you help me
last night?

37:29.772 --> 37:33.676
Well, it was dark
and you two are sort of weird.

37:35.913 --> 37:37.678
You know what?
Forget I said that.

37:37.680 --> 37:39.982
No, you know,
I'm just a crazy person.

37:39.984 --> 37:41.986
You... you should stay
the hell away from me.

37:46.456 --> 37:49.857
Wait, are there tall rocks
around here?

37:49.859 --> 37:51.826
What do you mean?
We're surrounded by them.

37:51.828 --> 37:54.597
I need to find the tallest peak.
Can you help me do that?

38:15.618 --> 38:17.021
I don't see
an easy way up there.

38:22.892 --> 38:24.661
Nathan, get down from there.

38:27.031 --> 38:28.165
Come up here, Laura.

38:29.532 --> 38:30.731
No way.

38:30.733 --> 38:33.103
I won't climb down
until you come up here.

38:35.738 --> 38:37.074
Shit!

38:44.647 --> 38:45.581
Come on.

39:00.897 --> 39:02.596
It m <i>ust be nice</i>
<i>to have the freedom</i>

39:02.598 --> 39:05.102
<i>to just run away and always
have someone find you.</i>

39:10.007 --> 39:12.709
I'm sorry about what
I said to you last night.

39:13.943 --> 39:15.576
I didn't mean it.

39:15.578 --> 39:17.081
Your life has plenty of meaning.

39:18.983 --> 39:20.583
Whatever, that's fine.

39:22.885 --> 39:25.220
I believe the kingdom
is over there.

39:25.222 --> 39:26.754
I see it.

39:26.756 --> 39:27.724
Let's go down and get it.

39:28.591 --> 39:31.226
The kingdom
is not that easy to find.

39:31.228 --> 39:32.860
It's hidden, remember?

39:32.862 --> 39:34.264
Come on, Nathan.

39:36.699 --> 39:38.100
Hey, Nathan.

39:38.102 --> 39:40.868
You dropped
a silver bird skull yesterday.

39:40.870 --> 39:43.171
If you come down,
I'll show you where it is.

39:43.173 --> 39:44.306
Yeah?

39:44.308 --> 39:45.541
All right, come on.

40:01.591 --> 40:04.692
All right.

40:06.863 --> 40:09.964
So, wait a minute.
He beat up your boyfriend?

40:09.966 --> 40:12.300
Yeah,
I kicked his teeth in.

40:12.302 --> 40:13.603
Kicked his teeth in?

40:15.205 --> 40:17.740
<i>I'd rather stay quiet
in loud places,</i>

40:18.808 --> 40:20.342
<i>listen for things that matter.</i>

40:20.344 --> 40:22.177
Let me get this straight,

40:22.179 --> 40:23.978
you pulled the fire alarm...

40:23.980 --> 40:26.714
Then I screamed,
"You're all gonna die."

40:26.716 --> 40:28.283
And the social worker?

40:28.285 --> 40:29.850
Bitch!

40:29.852 --> 40:31.819
Yeah, she is a bitch.

40:31.821 --> 40:33.188
Well. that sounds like fun.

40:33.190 --> 40:37.094
<i>Honestly, I'm afraid
of what others may see in me,</i>

40:38.262 --> 40:40.328
<i>the awkwardness,</i>

40:40.330 --> 40:42.266
<i>the difficulty I have
fitting in.</i>

40:43.666 --> 40:44.967
<i>He's a piece of me.</i>

40:46.936 --> 40:48.205
<i>And I am a piece of him.</i>

41:15.332 --> 41:16.732
There is no salt on these eggs.

41:17.667 --> 41:18.701
We're roughing it.

41:22.406 --> 41:24.339
Where are your parents?

41:24.341 --> 41:26.143
We're adults, so don't ask.

41:27.144 --> 41:28.112
Yeah, don't ask.

41:30.247 --> 41:34.748
Okay, you're both out here
to escape big expectations.

41:34.750 --> 41:37.219
I get it. The kingdom.

41:37.221 --> 41:40.122
Do you try to piece people
together on a regular basis?

41:40.124 --> 41:41.389
Yeah, as often as possible.

41:41.391 --> 41:43.057
You two are fused
together like rocks.

41:43.059 --> 41:44.161
Noel.

41:45.329 --> 41:47.795
He's been a cement truck driver
almost his whole life.

41:47.797 --> 41:49.997
It's where he gets
his unique outlook on life.

41:49.999 --> 41:51.067
Yeah.

41:52.236 --> 41:54.869
And dumbass here has a
way out by going to college,

41:54.871 --> 41:57.272
but he'd rather continue
building boats.

41:57.274 --> 41:58.540
Why?

41:58.542 --> 42:01.276
It's a good question, Nathan.
Why does anybody do anything?

42:01.278 --> 42:03.010
Jimmy thinks he knows it all.

42:03.012 --> 42:04.647
I love what I do, Noel.

42:05.415 --> 42:07.748
And you're okay
throwing your future away?

42:07.750 --> 42:09.652
You're not being fair
to him, Noel.

42:13.423 --> 42:17.760
See, finally, I have a friend
to stick up for me against you.

42:18.728 --> 42:20.295
Make that two friends.

42:20.297 --> 42:21.896
You're outnumbered, Noel.

42:24.800 --> 42:28.002
All right, lighten up, kids.
I'm not all bark.

42:28.004 --> 42:30.804
Actually, I open up whenever
Jimmy and I spend time together.

42:30.806 --> 42:32.274
Isn't that right?

42:32.276 --> 42:33.377
Kind of like therapy.

42:35.044 --> 42:36.112
Clear your mess, Jimmy.

42:42.486 --> 42:45.220
Hey, what were you
studying at school?

42:45.222 --> 42:47.424
General Ed stuff,
nothing really.

42:50.927 --> 42:52.126
It was psychology.

42:52.128 --> 42:53.796
He wants to be
a mental mechanic.

42:56.533 --> 42:59.234
Nathan, I'm assuming
you're not going to a hospital.

42:59.236 --> 43:01.436
I mean not that there's one
anywhere near here.

43:01.438 --> 43:03.837
I'll be more careful next time.

43:03.839 --> 43:06.907
Good, cause your sister needs a
big strong brother like you

43:06.909 --> 43:08.310
- to watch over her.
- Whoa!

43:08.312 --> 43:09.544
That's a lot of responsibility.

43:09.546 --> 43:11.180
Yeah.

43:12.482 --> 43:14.384
Do you think you're up
for the challenge, Nathan?

43:15.452 --> 43:17.285
I'll watch over you, woman.

43:17.287 --> 43:20.955
You can tell
he's the protective type, too.

43:20.957 --> 43:23.460
A lot of love between you guys,
a lot of history, too.

43:24.361 --> 43:25.229
You can see it.

43:26.430 --> 43:28.232
You two are lucky
to have each other.

43:29.165 --> 43:30.099
All right.

43:31.501 --> 43:33.337
I got something for you here.

43:35.239 --> 43:36.571
There is a mine
in the same direction

43:36.573 --> 43:38.808
that Nathan
thinks his kingdom is in.

43:42.211 --> 43:44.880
You follow the highway.

43:45.582 --> 43:48.851
Up you make a right
on this road here.

43:50.520 --> 43:56.223
If you... I mean, well,
when you get through "Last Chance Pass",

43:56.225 --> 43:57.292
you'll see the tunnel.

43:57.294 --> 43:59.429
It's right there on your right.
You can't miss it.

44:01.298 --> 44:03.933
Who knows? Maybe you'll find
something on the other side, right?

44:05.435 --> 44:07.335
- We should go with them.
- What?

44:07.337 --> 44:08.869
We're not gonna do this.

44:08.871 --> 44:10.338
I'm taking us back home.

44:10.340 --> 44:12.875
Laura, you promised
you'd help me find the kingdom.

44:17.113 --> 44:18.879
All right. I got an idea.

44:18.881 --> 44:21.385
Before you guys leave,
I want a group picture.

44:23.119 --> 44:24.319
What?

44:24.321 --> 44:27.324
I don't get any group photos
out here. It's just me, man.

44:28.358 --> 44:29.624
Come on.

44:29.626 --> 44:32.192
Guys, it's called a group photo.
You're supposed to be together.

44:32.194 --> 44:34.529
Jimmy. In, in, in. Come on.

44:34.531 --> 44:35.965
Okay. That'll work.

44:38.635 --> 44:41.070
Mm, smiles.

44:46.876 --> 44:48.242
Okay,
we are going to the mine

44:48.244 --> 44:49.413
to find the kingdom now.

44:55.051 --> 44:56.386
There you go.
That's nice.

45:07.163 --> 45:08.164
Thanks.

45:10.232 --> 45:11.233
Who knows?

45:12.369 --> 45:16.005
You may actually find
whatever it is he's looking for.

45:17.940 --> 45:18.841
Nathan.

45:23.613 --> 45:24.847
Good luck.

45:46.969 --> 45:48.438
The map says
to make a left.

45:50.306 --> 45:51.307
I'm turning right.

45:56.078 --> 45:57.614
When we find the kingdom,

45:59.383 --> 46:00.916
everything will be better.

46:02.118 --> 46:03.487
You and I will be happier.

46:04.488 --> 46:06.388
I promise.

46:06.390 --> 46:08.224
Are you sure you
can keep that promise?

46:10.059 --> 46:10.926
I can.

46:11.994 --> 46:13.430
I will keep my promise.

46:20.136 --> 46:21.003
Fine.

46:24.541 --> 46:26.476
Yes! Atta girl!

47:00.376 --> 47:04.011
Okay,
you have to go 39 miles

47:04.013 --> 47:05.379
until you hit this dirt road.

47:05.381 --> 47:06.246
Then what?

47:06.248 --> 47:09.318
You get us there,
then I'll tell you.

47:12.522 --> 47:15.557
<i>It's impossible not to
wonder how my life would be</i>

47:15.559 --> 47:18.660
<i>if Nathan wasn't
so dependent on me.</i>

47:18.662 --> 47:20.628
<i>It's just a simple question.</i>

47:20.630 --> 47:21.631
<i>What if?</i>

47:22.632 --> 47:24.799
<i>At times, I daydream
of the possibilities</i>

47:24.801 --> 47:26.503
<i>of who he could have been
in my life.</i>

47:29.338 --> 47:31.606
And appreciate
the vastness...

47:31.608 --> 47:33.643
<i>He would have been
that bright student,</i>

47:34.578 --> 47:36.212
<i>the popular kid,</i>

47:37.279 --> 47:39.379
<i>all eyes wanting to be like him.</i>

47:39.381 --> 47:42.985
They are involved
in gravitational pull...

47:44.253 --> 47:45.254
Hey...

47:46.656 --> 47:47.757
meet me outside.

47:49.759 --> 47:52.161
<i>He would know what
it feels like to have a crush,</i>

47:53.763 --> 47:56.432
<i>feel wanted,
and want that person back.</i>

48:13.315 --> 48:15.552
<i>There are times
I swear it's all an act.</i>

48:20.757 --> 48:23.660
<i>I hate him for everything
he could have been in my life.</i>

48:35.437 --> 48:36.472
<i>And, yet...</i>

48:37.641 --> 48:40.777
<i>I envy him for finding a way
to scrape by this far.</i>

48:49.485 --> 48:52.352
Pull it to the side of the road.

48:52.354 --> 48:53.489
It's heavy!

49:00.630 --> 49:02.131
It's full of costumes.

49:04.166 --> 49:05.702
Yeah, costumes.

49:08.504 --> 49:09.538
Woah!

49:14.578 --> 49:16.443
Movie, baby.

49:17.914 --> 49:19.181
Argh!

49:22.217 --> 49:23.152
Oh!

49:31.226 --> 49:33.262
Must search for adventure!

49:42.672 --> 49:43.539
Yes!

50:02.558 --> 50:04.191
That's it.

50:06.663 --> 50:08.765
We must proceed on foot.

50:11.500 --> 50:13.435
I can't believe
I'm going through with this.

50:31.855 --> 50:35.457
Hey, so let's check
this place out.

50:49.605 --> 50:52.207
It looks like no one's
lived here in a long time.

50:53.609 --> 50:55.845
Do you think our old place
looks like this now?

50:56.746 --> 50:58.447
I remember it
looking better.

51:09.558 --> 51:10.426
Got you.

51:15.497 --> 51:18.702
Nathan, you'll never catch me.

51:47.030 --> 51:48.464
What are you looking at?

51:49.733 --> 51:50.632
Nothing.

51:59.475 --> 52:02.342
Hey,
there's another house back here.

52:02.344 --> 52:03.179
Let's check it out.

52:07.050 --> 52:08.550
Totally creepy.

52:22.664 --> 52:23.532
Hello.

52:25.769 --> 52:26.936
It's nice to meet you.

52:29.705 --> 52:30.807
What are you doing?

52:31.707 --> 52:34.276
It's their house.
I'm being polite.

52:53.762 --> 52:54.630
Go in.

52:55.664 --> 52:57.699
You can't be serious.
It's pitch-black in there.

52:58.935 --> 53:00.469
- We'll go together.
- Wait.

53:01.871 --> 53:03.405
What if there's no way out?

53:05.108 --> 53:06.841
Noel said
there is a way out.

53:06.843 --> 53:08.542
He could be lying.

53:08.544 --> 53:11.413
Jimmy and Noel
probably befriend people,

53:12.414 --> 53:14.714
naive young people like us,

53:14.716 --> 53:17.084
and give us somewhere
to drive all the way up here

53:17.086 --> 53:18.554
and go into this mine.

53:19.721 --> 53:21.956
We'll be trapped
like dozens of others

53:21.958 --> 53:25.625
and then eventually die
a slow and torturous death.

53:25.627 --> 53:27.829
What do you think
traps them in there?

53:27.831 --> 53:31.132
A lot of things. Sick things.

53:31.134 --> 53:32.934
The couple
that lived in that house

53:32.936 --> 53:34.768
had like 30 kids
and convinced them

53:34.770 --> 53:36.170
to live and work in that mine.

53:36.172 --> 53:39.539
There's just
this twisted society in there

53:39.541 --> 53:40.844
just waiting for us to come in.

53:42.744 --> 53:43.947
They plan to eat us.

53:45.181 --> 53:47.716
We need an adventure.

53:48.885 --> 53:51.888
Yeah, one that we'll never
walk out of.

54:14.210 --> 54:16.443
Laura,
I don't see anything.

54:16.445 --> 54:18.814
Shh!
I hear some something.

54:20.016 --> 54:22.449
It's moving by the walls.

54:22.451 --> 54:23.985
Nathan, stay close.

54:23.987 --> 54:26.688
The master's coming so far.

54:34.063 --> 54:36.596
We must be quick
and stick together

54:36.598 --> 54:39.466
for I fear there's no forgiving
passage into the kingdom.

54:42.005 --> 54:45.106
The only way through
is by getting past all these people.

54:45.108 --> 54:48.175
Okay, don't...
don't eat them right away.

54:48.177 --> 54:49.743
Is anyone...
are you hungry?

54:49.745 --> 54:50.710
But no.

54:50.712 --> 54:54.514
I see you two have dressed
for the occasion,

54:54.516 --> 54:56.683
Marvelous.

54:56.685 --> 54:58.553
What is the occasion?

55:08.164 --> 55:10.697
We are celebrating
the return of our master.

55:20.642 --> 55:22.243
He had been
locked away, you see,

55:22.245 --> 55:24.611
but he's finally free

55:24.613 --> 55:27.281
and he will be making
his appearance soon.

55:27.283 --> 55:30.251
He will be pleased to see
that you two have joined in

55:30.253 --> 55:31.718
on the celebration,

55:31.720 --> 55:32.686
not to eat you,

55:32.688 --> 55:33.853
just to see you.

55:33.855 --> 55:34.788
Uh?

55:42.198 --> 55:46.100
Going down.

55:57.981 --> 56:02.582
When you meet my master
just have him smell you.

56:02.584 --> 56:07.021
Ah, delicious.

56:07.023 --> 56:09.223
I... never mind.
Go ahead, have fun at the party.

56:10.826 --> 56:12.494
Laura,
give me your lamp.

56:15.597 --> 56:16.998
Go along with it.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.002
Go along with what? We
need to find the way out of here.

56:20.069 --> 56:22.203
Let's just feel the room out.

56:22.205 --> 56:25.106
You guys are beautiful.

56:25.108 --> 56:27.308
All right,
so now what's your plan?

56:27.310 --> 56:29.876
We have a friend here
who can help. We can trust him.

56:29.878 --> 56:31.878
Nathan,
we don't have friends!

56:31.880 --> 56:33.247
Especially, not in a cave!

56:33.249 --> 56:34.881
Just calm down.

56:34.883 --> 56:37.519
Look, he's just over there.

56:38.287 --> 56:39.255
Come on.

56:42.191 --> 56:44.991
I now admit
this whole thing was a bad idea.

56:44.993 --> 56:46.093
I want to leave.

56:46.095 --> 56:48.064
Don't stop dancing.
It'll cause suspicion.

56:50.166 --> 56:53.234
- Condor Angel.
- Nathan.

56:53.236 --> 56:55.804
I didn't think you'd be daring
enough to take this route.

56:56.805 --> 56:59.040
The Evil Condor
knows you're here.

56:59.042 --> 57:00.607
I will help you escape.

57:00.609 --> 57:01.741
Not too soon.

57:01.743 --> 57:03.077
They'll catch us.

57:03.079 --> 57:07.081
We just need
to find an opportunity.

57:07.083 --> 57:09.818
So, is it really you?

57:11.054 --> 57:12.186
Hello, Laura.

57:12.188 --> 57:15.089
I was your guardian angel
when you were a little girl.

57:15.091 --> 57:17.058
It's nice to see you
all grown up.

57:17.060 --> 57:20.660
- I've been following you both.
- Are we near the kingdom?

57:20.662 --> 57:24.964
It exists just as you have
imagined it in your book,

57:24.966 --> 57:27.101
but these ghouls
aren't going to let you go

57:27.103 --> 57:29.103
until the master arrives
to greet you.

57:33.076 --> 57:35.811
Condor Angel, we have
to find a way out of here.

57:36.945 --> 57:38.013
Follow me.

57:39.415 --> 57:42.916
I am so bored
of this dancing.

57:42.918 --> 57:43.917
Surround them!

57:43.919 --> 57:46.786
Get them, eat them,
pick them limb from limb.

57:49.092 --> 57:50.093
Time to die.

57:51.127 --> 57:52.095
Laura.

57:54.297 --> 57:56.796
Our lamps,
grab our lamps.

58:01.670 --> 58:02.838
Their master's here.

58:04.806 --> 58:07.274
Run!

58:10.379 --> 58:12.313
Nathan, run! Run!

58:12.315 --> 58:15.715
Find the kingdom
before the Evil Condor finds you.

58:15.717 --> 58:17.817
Don't stop running!
Hurry!

58:17.819 --> 58:20.323
I will meet you
at the kingdom.

58:30.466 --> 58:34.002
Woo! Woo!

58:35.404 --> 58:36.705
Feels amazing.

58:41.843 --> 58:42.777
So, what now?

58:45.080 --> 58:46.946
You're lost for words, right?

58:46.948 --> 58:48.284
It's that amazing.

58:50.286 --> 58:53.054
It left you lost for words.

58:54.956 --> 58:56.691
It's nice to be
in your kingdom, Nathan.

59:00.263 --> 59:04.099
You know,
getting here was an adventure.

59:05.201 --> 59:08.067
And this place is almost
impossible to find, so...

59:08.069 --> 59:09.871
I need to hear you say it.

59:10.939 --> 59:11.973
Just say it.

59:13.742 --> 59:15.344
"I found my kingdom, Laura."

59:17.946 --> 59:22.115
Just say it because
that'll make everything better

59:22.117 --> 59:24.686
and we'll just be happier.

59:25.421 --> 59:27.190
And things will be perfect.

59:29.192 --> 59:30.158
It's wrong.

59:31.760 --> 59:32.794
It's all wrong.

59:37.966 --> 59:39.134
This is not it.

59:47.142 --> 59:49.312
If you don't claim it,
then I will.

59:50.779 --> 59:52.180
This is my kingdom.

59:53.982 --> 59:55.484
I found my kingdom!

59:58.787 --> 1:00:00.755
I found my kingdom!

1:00:06.895 --> 1:00:08.529
Let's go.

1:00:08.531 --> 1:00:09.864
I am going back home.

1:00:11.500 --> 1:00:12.901
We need to keep looking.

1:00:14.135 --> 1:00:15.003
No.

1:00:15.904 --> 1:00:16.771
We don't.

1:01:04.453 --> 1:01:05.820
Nathan, keep pushing.

1:01:07.889 --> 1:01:09.891
Laura, turn the wheel
towards the tree over there.

1:01:11.560 --> 1:01:12.493
Nice hat.

1:01:12.495 --> 1:01:15.531
Nice makeup.

1:01:37.620 --> 1:01:38.521
You look great.

1:01:39.921 --> 1:01:41.324
It's just something I picked up.

1:01:42.658 --> 1:01:44.290
How long have you
been waiting here?

1:01:44.292 --> 1:01:45.994
I didn't think you were ever
gonna show up.

1:01:49.465 --> 1:01:52.433
Meet me at the lake
just past Tunnel Road.

1:01:52.435 --> 1:01:54.601
And you left your phone number.

1:01:54.603 --> 1:01:56.069
You think you're smooth.

1:01:56.071 --> 1:01:58.304
Maybe, little bit.

1:01:58.306 --> 1:02:00.241
I should get a reward
just for showing up.

1:02:06.948 --> 1:02:08.649
What's up with the truck?

1:02:08.651 --> 1:02:10.917
We ran out of gas.

1:02:10.919 --> 1:02:12.020
I'm glad.

1:02:34.443 --> 1:02:38.313
Nathan, find the kingdom before
the Evil Condor finds you.

1:02:39.682 --> 1:02:40.949
Son of God.

1:02:44.319 --> 1:02:45.654
I need to find the kingdom.

1:02:46.622 --> 1:02:48.156
The Condor Angel
will be there soon.

1:02:50.058 --> 1:02:50.959
Nathan!

1:02:56.064 --> 1:02:56.998
Nathan.

1:02:59.435 --> 1:03:00.603
I'll be right back.

1:03:06.409 --> 1:03:07.942
Hey, Nathan,
how you doing, man?

1:03:09.277 --> 1:03:10.644
We need to leave.

1:03:10.646 --> 1:03:11.779
Now!

1:03:11.781 --> 1:03:14.380
The Condor Angel said
he was going to meet us there.

1:03:14.382 --> 1:03:15.283
Nathan...

1:03:16.619 --> 1:03:18.619
I'm going to use the restroom.

1:03:18.621 --> 1:03:20.388
I'll talk about it with you
when I get out.

1:03:22.290 --> 1:03:23.490
Hey, Nathan,
did you find the mine?

1:03:23.492 --> 1:03:24.625
Did you find
what you were looking for?

1:03:24.627 --> 1:03:26.127
Get out of my way!

1:03:31.700 --> 1:03:33.332
Don't worry.

1:03:33.334 --> 1:03:34.402
I'll keep an eye on him.

1:03:41.009 --> 1:03:42.074
I have to hurry,

1:03:42.076 --> 1:03:45.378
find the kingdom before
the Evil Condor finds you.

1:03:45.380 --> 1:03:46.281
I'm close.

1:03:47.282 --> 1:03:48.782
Just keep going.

1:03:48.784 --> 1:03:50.118
I'm almost there.

1:03:52.455 --> 1:03:55.254
I have to hurry,
I have to hurry!

1:03:55.256 --> 1:03:56.991
Sure know
how to pick your friends.

1:04:00.061 --> 1:04:01.029
I want to help them.

1:04:02.130 --> 1:04:04.700
Yep, I know you do.

1:04:36.832 --> 1:04:37.999
Nathan.

1:04:57.352 --> 1:04:59.653
Is that where
your kingdom is, Nathan?

1:04:59.655 --> 1:05:00.656
Over that mountain?

1:05:17.706 --> 1:05:19.642
Why don't you wait by the truck
for a minute, all right?

1:05:20.609 --> 1:05:22.510
I mean he has already
beat up one boyfriend, right?

1:05:28.249 --> 1:05:29.117
Nathan.

1:05:30.351 --> 1:05:32.320
What is the kingdom, really?

1:05:52.440 --> 1:05:53.474
Fill up the truck.

1:06:18.533 --> 1:06:19.602
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:06:20.836 --> 1:06:22.303
You look good just as yourself.

1:06:23.304 --> 1:06:24.172
Maybe.

1:06:25.040 --> 1:06:26.807
What do you guys
have planned today?

1:06:26.809 --> 1:06:29.342
Uhm...

1:06:29.344 --> 1:06:31.344
We were thinking
about getting away from the heat

1:06:31.346 --> 1:06:32.613
and heading up to the mountain.

1:06:32.615 --> 1:06:34.081
You and Nathan
should come with us.

1:06:34.083 --> 1:06:37.316
I'd actually really like to get some
gas from your RV before you leave.

1:06:37.318 --> 1:06:38.484
Well, listen,

1:06:38.486 --> 1:06:41.187
there's mountains stacked
on top of mountains up there.

1:06:41.189 --> 1:06:43.189
You know, no one really knows
about the place.

1:06:43.191 --> 1:06:46.192
There's only one trail that
leads up with an eyeshot of it,

1:06:46.194 --> 1:06:49.462
Mount Langley, the most gorgeous
mountain you're ever going to see.

1:06:49.464 --> 1:06:52.465
Yeah, plus,
we can all caravan up and share a campsite.

1:06:52.467 --> 1:06:53.399
There you go.

1:06:53.401 --> 1:06:54.567
It's just too far of a drive

1:06:54.569 --> 1:06:56.937
and at this point, I'd really
just like to get some gas.

1:06:56.939 --> 1:06:59.507
But it's not that far. It's just
a left on St. Peter's Road.

1:07:00.608 --> 1:07:02.743
You sure that road is going
to lead us to the kingdom?

1:07:02.745 --> 1:07:04.778
You have to be sure.

1:07:04.780 --> 1:07:06.880
Yes, Nathan,
it winds all the way up.

1:07:06.882 --> 1:07:07.750
Thanks, man.

1:07:08.917 --> 1:07:10.653
You're encouraging him again?

1:07:12.153 --> 1:07:15.621
We just went through a mine and
almost got lost, stranded, and killed.

1:07:15.623 --> 1:07:18.593
I'm not driving up
to some goddamn mountain now.

1:07:19.494 --> 1:07:20.561
You're an asshole.

1:07:22.530 --> 1:07:23.997
And you're an asshole, too.

1:07:23.999 --> 1:07:25.598
Hey, I'm just trying to help.

1:07:25.600 --> 1:07:27.233
What about me?

1:07:27.235 --> 1:07:29.402
Whoever is trying to help me?
I'll answer that.

1:07:29.404 --> 1:07:30.971
Nobody. All right?

1:07:30.973 --> 1:07:32.673
This is just a game
to all of you.

1:07:32.675 --> 1:07:35.374
Calm down. It's not about you
right now, princess, okay?

1:07:35.376 --> 1:07:36.877
It's about him.

1:07:36.879 --> 1:07:39.478
He is <i>my</i> brother.
He is my responsibility.

1:07:39.480 --> 1:07:41.948
And as soon as I get some gas,

1:07:41.950 --> 1:07:44.885
I am... I'm taking us home

1:07:44.887 --> 1:07:46.487
and forgetting
you two ever existed.

1:07:48.791 --> 1:07:50.693
Nathan, get out of the truck!

1:07:52.828 --> 1:07:55.327
Oh shit! Oh shit!

1:07:55.329 --> 1:07:58.199
Heeey!

1:07:59.768 --> 1:08:01.467
How much gas did you put in it?

1:08:01.469 --> 1:08:03.237
Uh, I don't know.

1:08:08.844 --> 1:08:11.312
Hold on, hold on.
I think I can pass from here.

1:08:14.817 --> 1:08:16.785
Nathan, pull over!

1:08:18.286 --> 1:08:20.923
Nathan, you can't find
the kingdom on your own.

1:08:22.490 --> 1:08:23.624
Watch out!

1:08:24.893 --> 1:08:27.027
Truck is going too fast,
we're gonna run out of road.

1:08:27.029 --> 1:08:29.628
Nathan, listen to me.

1:08:29.630 --> 1:08:32.866
You need me to help you
find your kingdom.

1:08:32.868 --> 1:08:34.333
No matter what you think of me,

1:08:34.335 --> 1:08:36.702
I'll always be
your little sister.

1:08:36.704 --> 1:08:39.373
And it's more important to me
than anything.

1:08:40.374 --> 1:08:41.607
No, it's gone.

1:08:41.609 --> 1:08:42.811
Maybe hit the rocks fast.

1:08:51.519 --> 1:08:54.455
Stay out of my way!
You are not helping!

1:08:59.727 --> 1:09:01.962
You have been planning on
leaving without me? Is that it?

1:09:01.964 --> 1:09:03.729
The Condor Angel
said we need to hurry.

1:09:03.731 --> 1:09:05.631
The Evil Condor
is following us.

1:09:05.633 --> 1:09:07.936
And I can't let you keep me
from finding my kingdom!

1:09:15.409 --> 1:09:16.845
We are wasting time.

1:09:18.446 --> 1:09:19.815
We need to leave now.

1:09:20.916 --> 1:09:22.481
All this has to stop.

1:09:22.483 --> 1:09:23.819
Laura, no.

1:09:25.254 --> 1:09:27.921
- This book has been keeping you sick.
- Please stop.

1:09:27.923 --> 1:09:29.790
You need to be
a responsible man.

1:09:29.792 --> 1:09:31.124
Please, Laura, please.

1:09:31.126 --> 1:09:34.360
- And stop creating all this make-believe bullshit.
- No, no, no.

1:09:34.362 --> 1:09:35.494
What have you done?

1:09:35.496 --> 1:09:36.830
I'll tell you what's real.

1:09:36.832 --> 1:09:38.731
You and I, you ruined my life.

1:09:41.469 --> 1:09:44.770
I regret
ever telling you about it.

1:09:44.772 --> 1:09:46.809
There is no kingdom, Nathan!

1:09:47.810 --> 1:09:50.076
I was nine years old
and I made the whole thing up

1:09:50.078 --> 1:09:53.046
just to make you feel better
when our dad ditched us.

1:09:55.616 --> 1:09:58.086
Grow up and start acting
like a man, okay?

1:09:59.487 --> 1:10:01.620
No, no. No.

1:10:01.622 --> 1:10:04.858
What is it? It's nothing.
It's nothing, Nathan!

1:10:04.860 --> 1:10:07.393
I'm just gonna live out
the rest of my life without you

1:10:07.395 --> 1:10:10.897
because all of this is just
how fucked up my life is!

1:10:29.684 --> 1:10:30.716
Come on.

1:10:30.718 --> 1:10:31.954
Time to go, Jimmy.

1:11:21.036 --> 1:11:22.534
I hate her!

1:11:22.536 --> 1:11:23.937
I wish she was never born.

1:11:23.939 --> 1:11:25.140
Your book!

1:11:28.476 --> 1:11:30.511
- Nathan, listen to me, man.
- Leave me alone!

1:11:32.180 --> 1:11:34.080
She made it all up.

1:11:34.082 --> 1:11:35.783
Doesn't matter anymore.

1:11:53.936 --> 1:11:54.802
Nathan...

1:11:56.704 --> 1:11:57.838
you believe in fate, man?

1:11:59.774 --> 1:12:01.909
You know nothing happens
by accident?

1:12:05.280 --> 1:12:06.214
See, I don't...

1:12:08.083 --> 1:12:09.650
I think we all have choices
to make.

1:12:13.621 --> 1:12:14.655
It's kind of heavy.

1:12:15.589 --> 1:12:16.957
Beautiful, too.

1:12:16.959 --> 1:12:18.060
Listen, Nathan,

1:12:19.760 --> 1:12:21.229
Laura is here
because she loves you.

1:12:25.033 --> 1:12:26.201
It's your kingdom, Nathan.

1:12:27.468 --> 1:12:30.671
Nobody else has to believe in it
for it to be real but you, man.

1:13:40.975 --> 1:13:42.977
Did Jimmy and Noel say
where they were going?

1:13:47.882 --> 1:13:49.884
I have been holding
a lot of anger in me.

1:13:50.851 --> 1:13:52.718
And it's not fair
that I let it out on you.

1:13:52.720 --> 1:13:55.121
Tell me the real reason
why you're here

1:13:55.123 --> 1:13:57.325
and be honest.

1:14:02.897 --> 1:14:03.798
You know,

1:14:05.133 --> 1:14:07.102
the kingdom could be right
on the other side of this forest.

1:14:09.204 --> 1:14:10.905
What do you say, Spirit Wing?

1:14:15.776 --> 1:14:18.080
I've received word
that we are very close.

1:14:24.885 --> 1:14:27.353
Noel and Jimmy
gave you that map?

1:14:27.355 --> 1:14:28.656
Today could be the day.

1:14:30.158 --> 1:14:31.625
We must travel north.

1:14:35.130 --> 1:14:37.330
Do I really have to wear this?

1:14:37.332 --> 1:14:38.298
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1:14:38.300 --> 1:14:39.232
Put it on!

1:14:59.221 --> 1:15:02.089
- Hey, let's race.
- Go for it!

1:15:50.004 --> 1:15:51.972
You must be
the Condor Angel's mother.

1:15:53.941 --> 1:15:54.875
I'm Nathan.

1:15:55.776 --> 1:15:56.744
It's nice to meet you.

1:16:03.318 --> 1:16:06.252
<i>Nathan is
a great believer of the truth.</i>

1:16:06.254 --> 1:16:08.456
<i>I've never known
a better judge of character.</i>

1:16:10.325 --> 1:16:12.760
<i>I'm always scared to wonder
what he thinks of me.</i>

1:16:14.061 --> 1:16:16.298
<i>Assuming things
can just go on like this.</i>

1:16:17.765 --> 1:16:21.267
<i>How far back do you
remember things, like, with mom and dad?</i>

1:16:21.269 --> 1:16:22.468
<i>I remember the park.</i>

1:16:22.470 --> 1:16:25.273
Mom brought us out for a picnic
and dad brought a kite.

1:16:26.408 --> 1:16:28.208
Dad held the kite up.

1:16:28.210 --> 1:16:29.775
I ran behind him.

1:16:29.777 --> 1:16:31.411
Mom is running next to me.

1:16:31.413 --> 1:16:33.981
We all wanted the kite to fly up
and then it finally flew up.

1:16:37.319 --> 1:16:39.153
I thought we were gonna run
like that forever.

1:16:41.121 --> 1:16:42.490
I've never heard that story.

1:16:50.164 --> 1:16:51.897
Hey, Laura.

1:16:51.899 --> 1:16:53.399
Yeah?

1:16:53.401 --> 1:16:55.501
I remember something else.

1:16:55.503 --> 1:16:57.303
What's that?

1:16:57.305 --> 1:16:58.406
On your graduation,

1:16:59.307 --> 1:17:01.940
I pretended to be
one of your friends

1:17:01.942 --> 1:17:04.410
sitting next to you,
wearing what you were wearing

1:17:04.412 --> 1:17:05.911
and feeling
what you were feeling.

1:17:05.913 --> 1:17:06.981
I was so happy.

1:17:08.182 --> 1:17:10.352
I thought of the dreams you had
and they became mine, too.

1:17:11.952 --> 1:17:13.355
Mom clapped when she saw you.

1:17:15.457 --> 1:17:18.358
Please stop with all that,
I am tired.

1:17:18.360 --> 1:17:20.892
I told mom that I wished
I was like you.

1:17:20.894 --> 1:17:23.128
I wanted to be popular,

1:17:23.130 --> 1:17:27.899
have a lot of friends
to tell my stories to,

1:17:27.901 --> 1:17:28.969
be in love.

1:17:31.105 --> 1:17:33.441
I wanted to be in love,
like you,

1:17:34.409 --> 1:17:35.541
have a relationship.

1:17:35.543 --> 1:17:38.446
I mean I was so happy for you
for having everything.

1:17:42.384 --> 1:17:45.117
It doesn't make
any sense to do that.

1:17:45.119 --> 1:17:47.287
Nathan, how sick are you?

1:17:47.289 --> 1:17:50.323
Mom is dead.
I never had any of that.

1:17:50.325 --> 1:17:53.461
Everything you imagined
about me is a lie.

1:17:55.062 --> 1:17:55.894
Okay, look at me!

1:17:55.896 --> 1:17:57.463
I'm standing
right in front of you.

1:17:57.465 --> 1:17:58.932
Why are you so angry?

1:18:00.335 --> 1:18:02.000
I am a lost girl!

1:18:02.002 --> 1:18:05.505
I don't have friends,
no childhood I want to remember.

1:18:05.507 --> 1:18:07.939
My life is broken.

1:18:07.941 --> 1:18:10.345
And you're broken, too.

1:18:12.580 --> 1:18:14.148
I can help you fix it.

1:18:15.617 --> 1:18:17.352
I can help you
find your kingdom.

1:18:19.920 --> 1:18:22.154
Oh, really?

1:18:22.156 --> 1:18:24.390
I have a... I have a kingdom?

1:18:24.392 --> 1:18:26.258
I have a kingdom?

1:18:26.260 --> 1:18:29.263
I have a kingdom?
I have a fucking kingdom?

1:18:30.964 --> 1:18:32.230
Well, how about this?

1:18:32.232 --> 1:18:34.534
The day that you find
your kingdom,

1:18:34.536 --> 1:18:37.104
I'll start looking for mine.

1:18:38.640 --> 1:18:40.640
We need to go home. Now.

1:18:40.642 --> 1:18:44.042
No. Come on, Nathan,
we gotta find your kingdom.

1:18:44.044 --> 1:18:46.880
Sure it's right on the other
side of this hill, so, let's go!

1:18:48.015 --> 1:18:51.049
Laura! Laura!

1:18:51.051 --> 1:18:53.854
I'd rather go hoping
to help you fix things.

1:19:14.041 --> 1:19:15.075
Where are you?

1:19:16.578 --> 1:19:18.312
I'm not playing anymore.

1:19:23.551 --> 1:19:24.452
Laura!

1:19:25.352 --> 1:19:26.954
Don't leave me alone, Laura.

1:19:29.022 --> 1:19:30.290
Laura, please.

1:19:42.169 --> 1:19:45.038
Laura, please,
don't leave me alone.

1:19:55.349 --> 1:19:56.216
Laura!

1:19:57.151 --> 1:19:59.419
Don't leave me alone, Laura.

1:20:09.497 --> 1:20:11.566
Laura, please!

1:20:15.637 --> 1:20:17.505
Laura, don't leave me!

1:20:23.143 --> 1:20:25.545
I'm not afraid of you!

1:20:25.547 --> 1:20:27.682
You can't keep me
from my kingdom!

1:20:28.616 --> 1:20:30.550
I'm not afraid of you!

1:20:30.552 --> 1:20:33.753
You can't keep me
from my kingdom!

1:20:51.739 --> 1:20:53.508
Ah! Ah!

1:21:03.785 --> 1:21:05.252
<i>Stop!</i>

1:21:06.754 --> 1:21:09.389
The angel doesn't run away
when he's scared.

1:21:10.592 --> 1:21:11.557
He's not ready.

1:21:11.559 --> 1:21:13.559
Nathan, what's wrong with you?

1:21:13.561 --> 1:21:14.729
Nothing is wrong with me.

1:21:16.029 --> 1:21:19.197
<i>You're different
and I like that about you.</i>

1:21:19.199 --> 1:21:20.700
Because no matter
what happens,

1:21:20.702 --> 1:21:23.270
brothers and sisters
stick together forever.

1:21:34.649 --> 1:21:37.652
You have to take care of me,
too, because you're older.

1:21:46.159 --> 1:21:47.094
Ah!

1:21:50.464 --> 1:21:52.497
I'm not afraid of you.

1:21:53.601 --> 1:21:55.535
I'm not afraid of you!

1:22:03.410 --> 1:22:07.178
I create my doubts,
my fears,

1:22:07.180 --> 1:22:08.513
and I can defeat you!

1:22:18.358 --> 1:22:19.493
Nathan!

1:22:21.328 --> 1:22:22.630
Where are you?

1:22:26.568 --> 1:22:27.735
Nathan!

1:23:04.706 --> 1:23:06.406
I'm sorry things were tough.

1:23:11.846 --> 1:23:13.681
As long as we find
your kingdom...

1:23:16.718 --> 1:23:19.419
we'll never get hurt or sick

1:23:21.288 --> 1:23:22.690
or ever feel scared.

1:23:24.591 --> 1:23:26.426
It's never cold or too hot,

1:23:27.594 --> 1:23:29.864
and it never gets dark
so we can play

1:23:30.932 --> 1:23:32.700
as much as we want

1:23:33.567 --> 1:23:34.869
without getting tired.

1:23:37.805 --> 1:23:39.641
No one gets lonely
in the kingdom.

1:23:41.743 --> 1:23:42.844
We'll be happy here.

1:23:44.846 --> 1:23:45.713
It's perfect.

1:23:49.951 --> 1:23:52.219
Still sounds
too good to be true.

1:23:55.857 --> 1:23:57.424
That must be Mount Langley.

1:24:02.864 --> 1:24:03.931
So now what?

1:24:09.671 --> 1:24:10.537
Hey.

1:24:13.273 --> 1:24:14.974
I'm glad that you found
your kingdom,

1:24:14.976 --> 1:24:17.444
but I can't let you stay,
you'll die out here.

1:24:23.751 --> 1:24:24.952
I made a decision.

1:24:26.553 --> 1:24:28.288
You can't take that
away from me.

1:24:35.529 --> 1:24:37.529
Condor Angel!

1:24:37.531 --> 1:24:41.666
Condor Angel, we made it!

1:24:41.668 --> 1:24:44.337
Whooo! We made it!

1:24:46.040 --> 1:24:48.406
I'm glad that we made it.

1:24:48.408 --> 1:24:50.810
We are at the kingdom!

1:24:50.812 --> 1:24:51.913
This way!

1:24:56.718 --> 1:24:58.685
Whoa!

1:25:00.353 --> 1:25:01.686
Come on, Nathan!

1:25:01.688 --> 1:25:04.724
Nathan, you did it!

1:25:04.726 --> 1:25:05.760
Let's go!

1:26:15.562 --> 1:26:16.761
Alright, guys.

1:26:16.763 --> 1:26:18.931
Remember today that we're doing
the ballroom box stuff.

1:26:18.933 --> 1:26:20.032
You guys are doing a great job.

1:26:20.034 --> 1:26:23.068
It's continuing four steps,
you can step together,

1:26:23.070 --> 1:26:24.437
step together.

1:26:34.514 --> 1:26:35.917
Uh, nice room.

1:26:41.621 --> 1:26:43.356
I got your favorite.

1:26:44.892 --> 1:26:46.326
Happy 25th birthday!

1:26:47.694 --> 1:26:48.963
It's nice to see you, Laura.

1:26:50.730 --> 1:26:52.432
It's nice to see you, too.

1:26:53.134 --> 1:26:55.870
Here, open your present.

1:26:57.939 --> 1:27:00.139
"To the best big brother
in the kingdom.

1:27:00.141 --> 1:27:01.441
Love, Laura."

1:27:10.985 --> 1:27:12.885
Pretty cool, huh?

1:27:12.887 --> 1:27:14.654
Bet you didn't think
I had it in me.

1:27:25.765 --> 1:27:27.367
I miss you a lot.

1:27:28.702 --> 1:27:29.569
I miss you, too.

1:27:33.074 --> 1:27:35.607
You should come
to my housewarming party.

1:27:35.609 --> 1:27:37.675
I didn't know
you were having one.

1:27:37.677 --> 1:27:39.444
I still have some work to do
around the room,

1:27:39.446 --> 1:27:41.148
but I'll send you
an invitation soon.

1:27:59.566 --> 1:28:00.700
Where's your book?

1:28:03.237 --> 1:28:04.704
I don't need it anymore.

1:28:17.084 --> 1:28:18.152
<i>Nathan...</i>

1:28:19.086 --> 1:28:20.087
are you happy?

1:28:21.855 --> 1:28:22.889
I will be.

1:28:26.027 --> 1:28:27.861
Your kingdom
will be different from mine,

1:28:29.063 --> 1:28:31.230
but I'll help you
find your kingdom

1:28:31.232 --> 1:28:33.633
as long as you help me
find mine, too.

1:28:38.005 --> 1:28:38.940
Okay.

1:28:52.519 --> 1:28:55.222
<i>I now try to convince
myself that I am capable of anything.</i>

1:28:57.058 --> 1:29:00.527
<i>I am boring in comparison to all
the great characters we create.</i>

1:29:05.099 --> 1:29:07.532
<i>We're part of some epic journey</i>

1:29:07.534 --> 1:29:10.237
<i>put together by the imagination
of a greater being.</i>

1:29:11.671 --> 1:29:13.473
<i>And for the first time
in my life,</i>

1:29:15.042 --> 1:29:16.710
<i>I can let myself breathe.</i>

1:29:18.878 --> 1:29:20.247
<i>No longer be afraid.</i>

1:29:22.016 --> 1:29:25.317
<i>I'm the closest I have ever been
to finding it now.</i>

1:29:25.319 --> 1:29:27.854
<i>And I have a fresh start.</i>

1:29:48.009 --> 1:29:50.577
Thanks for coming
to my housewarming party.

1:29:51.811 --> 1:29:53.147
It's great to be here with you.

1:29:54.881 --> 1:29:55.947
Drum roll!

1:30:04.791 --> 1:30:07.627
Jimmy, please,
hand her the family photo.
