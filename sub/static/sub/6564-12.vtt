Hi, I'm looking for CeCe Jones.

00:15.400 --> 00:18.130
I want to talk to her about school.

00:21.220 --> 00:21.940
School?

00:22.620 --> 00:26.280
Uh, you see that
really tall girl over there?

00:26.310 --> 00:28.320
That is CeCe Jones.

00:32.250 --> 00:35.320
Hi, Mark Taussig, it's nice to
meet me, the pleasure is yours.

00:37.190 --> 00:38.290
If you say so.

00:38.330 --> 00:40.030
I do. Because it's true.

00:43.070 --> 00:46.070
I'm the Dean of Admissions of
the Chicago Fine Arts Academy.

00:46.100 --> 00:48.110
I want to talk to you
about auditioning for CFA.

00:51.080 --> 00:52.080
Hi, I'm CeCe Jones.

00:53.080 --> 00:56.150
Sorry about saying I wasn't.

00:56.180 --> 00:58.350
You know, stranger danger.

01:00.190 --> 01:04.319
Well, I don't know who the stranger
is, but I know who the danger is.

02:05.980 --> 02:09.090
How could you have for the two of usons

02:09.120 --> 02:11.020
to the Chicago Fine Arts
Academy and not tell me?

02:11.060 --> 02:14.990
Pretty easily, actually.

02:15.030 --> 02:17.260
It was all online.
A few buttons.

02:17.290 --> 02:20.000
So, what are we gonna
wear for the audition?

02:20.030 --> 02:22.000
I'm not wearing anything.

02:22.030 --> 02:25.130
Well, that'll get you noticed.
It'll get you in.

02:27.100 --> 02:29.140
I'm not wearing anything,
because I'm not going.

02:29.170 --> 02:30.940
Okay, look, it was very sweet of you

02:30.970 --> 02:32.270
to commit online fraud for me...

02:34.210 --> 02:36.150
But as much as I love dancing,

02:36.180 --> 02:40.020
I'm not going to a school
my standard of academia.

02:40.050 --> 02:42.020
Wow. What an ego on you.

02:43.360 --> 02:46.220
We weren't accepted prestigious school

02:46.260 --> 02:49.090
anyone in their right mind
would be thrilled to go to.

02:49.130 --> 02:50.230
We were asked to audition.

02:50.260 --> 02:53.200
I thought it would be
a great experience for us,

02:53.230 --> 02:55.300
but obviously you're too
busy with your macadamia.

02:57.370 --> 03:00.010
My blue, one-sleeve leotard.

03:00.040 --> 03:01.140
What are you talking about?

03:01.170 --> 03:03.080
"My outfit for the audition," she said,

03:03.110 --> 03:05.110
trying to gloss over the fact
that her best friend has a point.

03:05.250 --> 03:07.150
Sweet.

03:09.220 --> 03:10.320
Wait, I'm that best friend, right?

03:17.190 --> 03:19.260
I'll get it, Mom!

03:22.160 --> 03:24.060
Hello, my bespectacled friend,

03:24.100 --> 03:27.130
who is unsuccessfully trying
to bring back the bow tie.

03:28.970 --> 03:29.100
Hi, Flynn.

03:31.100 --> 03:34.270
Hi, Flynn? Hi, Flynn?

03:34.310 --> 03:36.940
Where's the insult?

03:36.980 --> 03:39.980
Where's the big words I have
to look up after you leave?

03:40.010 --> 03:43.050
I see that you ascertained I am
uncharacteristically aloof today.

03:44.320 --> 03:47.250
And he's back.
So what's up?

03:47.290 --> 03:49.150
Well, the good news is

03:49.190 --> 03:51.220
I've discovered an unidentified meteor,

03:51.260 --> 03:53.090
which means I get naming rights.

03:55.230 --> 03:58.300
That's cool and boring.

03:58.330 --> 04:01.270
Well, the bad news is, the meteor
is hurtling towards Earth,

04:01.300 --> 04:03.230
and impact will be in four days.

04:03.270 --> 04:04.270
You know what this means, don't you?

04:04.300 --> 04:06.970
I sure do.

04:07.010 --> 04:09.210
No point wasting my last
few days on this junk.

04:10.280 --> 04:12.210
Come on, let's go find some chicks,

04:12.250 --> 04:14.010
go to Vegas and get crazy!

04:20.220 --> 04:22.150
Wow, look at all these dancers,

04:22.190 --> 04:24.090
I mean, you can smell the anxiety.

04:24.120 --> 04:26.130
Will they get in, won't they get in?

04:28.260 --> 04:30.260
You know, I'm glad we're just
here for the experience.

04:30.300 --> 04:32.930
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't
hear a word you said

04:32.970 --> 04:33.930
because I was too busy...

04:33.970 --> 04:36.230
Freaking out!

04:36.270 --> 04:39.200
Look at that girl, she's
holding her leg over her head.

04:43.110 --> 04:45.110
And those guys just doing
leaps across the room

04:45.140 --> 04:47.080
like super heroes.

04:47.110 --> 04:49.950
Oh, you left out that one
guy in the really tighty

04:49.980 --> 04:52.280
tight, tight, tight tights.

04:52.320 --> 04:54.180
Whoo! That cannot be healthy.

04:55.350 --> 04:58.190
Everyone, can we gather, please?

04:58.220 --> 05:00.290
Gather, gather.
I'm waiting.

05:00.320 --> 05:04.060
Gathering. Oh, not so close
that I can smell the anxiety.

05:06.230 --> 05:09.130
Thank you all for coming.

05:09.170 --> 05:10.930
Thousands applied, but you represent

05:10.970 --> 05:13.240
the best Chicago has to offer.

05:14.140 --> 05:16.940
I know, I chose you.

05:18.240 --> 05:19.270
Wow, thousands?
I didn't realize that.

05:19.310 --> 05:22.110
This is very flattering.

05:22.150 --> 05:24.250
Graduates from our school appear in movies,

05:24.280 --> 05:29.090
on Broadway, and some even
go on to have a sandwich

05:29.120 --> 05:30.320
named after them at Melvin's Delicatessen.

05:33.020 --> 05:36.060
The Mark Taussig is black forest ham,

05:36.090 --> 05:39.060
brie cheese on rye with a tangy
thousand island dressing.

05:41.300 --> 05:44.100
Fat-free, tangy
thousand island dressing.

05:44.140 --> 05:46.100
Wow, I never thought of myself

05:46.140 --> 05:48.040
as possibly one day being a sandwich.

05:49.310 --> 05:51.180
Others find that the dance
world isn't for them,

05:51.210 --> 05:55.080
but because of our
top notch academic program,

05:55.110 --> 05:59.220
they find themselves being
accepted into Ivy League schools.

06:01.220 --> 06:03.060
Did you hear that?
Ivy League, Ivy League, Ivy League...

06:06.230 --> 06:12.030
If I didn't know any better, I'd say
you want this just as much as I do.

06:12.070 --> 06:14.100
Don't just stand there, help
me get my leg over my head.

06:19.070 --> 06:20.270
Why do we have to call NASA?

06:20.310 --> 06:23.980
I already emailed them to
warn them about the meteor.

06:24.010 --> 06:27.110
Dude, I'm pretty sure the end of
the world is worth a phone call.

06:28.950 --> 06:33.020
But you know I have
telephone-based anxiety issues.

06:33.050 --> 06:35.250
<i>Thanks for holding.</i> <i>This is

06:35.290 --> 06:36.960

Hey, Captain.
My super genius friend

06:38.990 --> 06:40.230
has discovered a meteor
heading towards Earth

06:40.260 --> 06:41.430
with the coordinates of,

06:41.460 --> 06:46.200
right ascension 58 degrees
and declination of 45 degrees.

06:46.230 --> 06:50.000
<i>Well,</i>
<i>isn't that the cutest story.</i>

06:50.040 --> 06:51.300

<i>some astronaut ice cream?</i>

06:55.240 --> 06:59.040
Seriously, this is a national emergency!

06:59.080 --> 07:00.080
Do you have strawberry?

07:02.020 --> 07:04.120
This is unbelievable!

07:04.150 --> 07:07.050
I know, I didn't give her my address.

07:07.090 --> 07:08.020
How's she going to know
where to send my ice cream?

07:12.130 --> 07:13.960
Here's how this is going to work.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.060
Based on your performance of this dance,

07:15.100 --> 07:18.200
I'm going to whittle you
down to the final four.

07:18.230 --> 07:23.040
No pressure, but for most of
you, your dreams die today.

You four are moving on...

08:55.160 --> 08:56.130
...to the interview stage.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.030
Unfortunately, for two of you,

09:00.070 --> 09:03.300
it'll be the last stage you're ever on.

09:05.210 --> 09:08.140
Interview?
That sounds like a test.

09:08.170 --> 09:09.880
No, no, no, Cece.
It's nothing like a test, okay.

09:09.910 --> 09:11.140
You don't study for it.

09:11.180 --> 09:13.980
Oh, okay. Well, in that case,
it sounds exactly like a test!

09:20.250 --> 09:23.120
Ta-da! What do you think?

09:23.160 --> 09:27.260
I think it's interesting that when
faced with your own mortality,

09:27.290 --> 09:27.990
you decide to make yourself lunch.

09:30.970 --> 09:36.100
This isn't lunch.
This is an item on my bucket list.

09:36.140 --> 09:40.140
You know, your list of things to
do before you kick the bucket.

09:40.170 --> 09:44.010
Or in this case,
get pulverized by a meteor.

09:44.040 --> 09:47.150
Number 22, eat a sandwich
that contains every sandwich.

09:47.180 --> 09:51.990
So here is the "PBT-RBHT-
CSC-JAS-R-Double W.

09:52.220 --> 09:55.920
"LT."

09:55.960 --> 09:59.230
That's a peanut butter,
tuna, roast beef, ham,

09:59.260 --> 10:02.230
turkey, chicken salad, with cheddar, jack,

10:02.260 --> 10:05.060
American and Swiss,
on rye, white and wheat...

10:07.130 --> 10:09.100
With lettuce and tomato.

10:10.200 --> 10:12.270
Well, I'm saving the world!

10:12.300 --> 10:15.070
I'm buying everything I need to
build a gamma ray deflector.

10:15.110 --> 10:20.010
Let's see, the last item in my shopping
cart is three tons of sheet metal.

10:21.980 --> 10:24.220
Proceed to checkout? Yes.

10:24.250 --> 10:25.990
Do you have a coupon?

10:26.020 --> 10:27.320
No, no I don't.

10:31.190 --> 10:33.990
Do you want your items gift wrapped?

10:34.030 --> 10:36.260
Sure, why not?
We're about to be creamed by a meteor,

10:36.300 --> 10:37.330
it'll brighten the mood.

10:39.200 --> 10:42.240
And, submit order.
There, done!

10:42.270 --> 10:44.340
We're saved! The world's not
gonna end in four days!

10:44.370 --> 10:46.270
Whoo! Yeah!

10:49.040 --> 10:55.010
Uh-oh. Five days for shipping.

10:55.050 --> 10:57.080
I hope it's free 'cause we're all gonna
be dead by the time it gets here.

11:01.290 --> 11:07.960
Hi, I'm CeCe, I'm a Pisces which
means my symbol is two fish.

11:07.990 --> 11:11.100
Which is weird because I wouldn't
eat one fish, let alone two.

11:12.130 --> 11:13.230
I like pork chops.

11:16.070 --> 11:18.300
CeCe, we haven't asked you anything yet.

11:20.270 --> 11:23.010
Right.

11:23.040 --> 11:24.980
So, CeCe and I started dancing
when we were little.

11:25.010 --> 11:28.180
Actually, CeCe and I met in dance class...

11:28.210 --> 11:31.280
We don't want to hear about CeCe.
We want to hear about you.

11:31.320 --> 11:34.050
Who is Rocky?

11:34.090 --> 11:36.990
Oh, that's easy.
I'm CeCe's best friend.

11:38.290 --> 11:40.360
Oh, sorry.
And dance partner.

11:41.290 --> 11:44.260
Oh, hold on, my phone is ringing.

11:44.300 --> 11:47.230
Oh, it's my agent.
You better act fast.

11:47.270 --> 11:50.240
Because I'm in high demand.

11:50.270 --> 11:55.110
Oh, hold on, it's my phone.
Hello? What's that?

11:55.140 --> 11:57.310
Tell her to cut the bunk, we
want to know who CeCe really is?

11:58.380 --> 12:00.210
Well, I, I...

12:01.180 --> 12:03.350
Can't I just dance again?

12:03.380 --> 12:05.020
Why is dance special to you?

12:06.190 --> 12:11.920
Because dancing is fun.
Dancing is cool.

12:11.960 --> 12:13.060
Dancing is, you know,

12:14.090 --> 12:15.060
great.

12:17.130 --> 12:19.070
Okay, here's the deal.

12:21.100 --> 12:25.110
I'm not the smartest kid
in history, or math,

12:25.140 --> 12:28.240
or science, or language,

12:28.280 --> 12:31.050
or any other subject...

12:31.080 --> 12:33.280
You do realize this is a
school you're applying to.

12:35.020 --> 12:37.990
My point is, that... Yeah,

12:38.020 --> 12:40.190
I'm not the best student.

12:40.220 --> 12:44.030
But the dance floor is the one place

12:46.000 --> 12:47.230
I get to be a genius.

12:49.270 --> 12:52.130
Nice.

12:52.170 --> 12:55.140
When I was growing up, I went through
this really insane growth spurt.

12:55.170 --> 13:01.180
And everyone made fun of me and called
me names like giraffe and tree,

13:01.210 --> 13:03.280
and just in case you are wondering,
yes, the weather is fine up here.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.980
I mean, everyone made me feel so awkward.

13:08.020 --> 13:10.290
But when I would dance,

13:10.320 --> 13:13.960
all those names, they would slip away.
I wasn't awkward.

13:13.990 --> 13:16.230
I was... I was me!

13:16.260 --> 13:18.930
And I was graceful, and...

13:18.960 --> 13:19.100
I felt alive.

13:22.230 --> 13:23.270
Good answer.

13:23.300 --> 13:25.070
So I got an A?

13:25.100 --> 13:26.140
That's for me to decide.
Right.

13:30.240 --> 13:34.180
Mmm, bill for Mom, bill for
me that I'll give to Mom,

13:34.210 --> 13:37.080
catalogue for Mom that I'll take for me...

13:40.320 --> 13:42.080
I got a letter from CFA!

13:42.120 --> 13:42.520
Me too! I got a packet!

13:45.020 --> 13:46.060
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

13:48.190 --> 13:51.160
Why did I get a letter,
and you got a packet?

13:51.200 --> 13:53.960
Wait, why did I get a packet
and you got a letter?

13:54.000 --> 13:57.270
Uh-oh. You're in, I'm out.

13:57.300 --> 13:59.270
Rocky, we applied to a school.

13:59.300 --> 14:01.270
Isn't it more likely that
you're in, and I'm out?

14:02.110 --> 14:05.040
Well, normally, yes.

14:05.070 --> 14:07.910
But CeCe, big envelopes have
all the information and forms.

14:07.940 --> 14:09.040
Small envelopes mean
I'll never be a sandwich.

14:11.280 --> 14:14.250
Unless big envelopes mean...

14:14.280 --> 14:16.090
I have no idea what it means, guess
I'll just have to open it and find out.

14:18.250 --> 14:20.090
Okay...

14:23.960 --> 14:27.030
Yes! I did it!
I got in! I got in!

14:27.060 --> 14:28.100
Not that it matters.

14:30.270 --> 14:34.300
I mean, it's just
a stupid school. Who cares?

14:34.340 --> 14:37.240
Yeah, you're right.
It's no big deal.

14:37.270 --> 14:40.210
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna
go make The Rocky Blue sandwich.

14:40.240 --> 14:43.150
Alfalfa and Brussels
sprouts on moldy bread.

14:43.180 --> 14:44.600
All things nobody wants.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.800
Rocky, don't rip up your letter.

14:56.830 --> 14:58.160
You should at least read it first.

14:58.200 --> 15:01.930
Why not? They clearly don't
think I'm talented enough.

15:04.840 --> 15:05.870
Wait, wait, wait!
This piece says,

15:05.910 --> 15:09.080
"You have been accep...
Congra..."

15:10.080 --> 15:12.110
Let me see that.

15:14.780 --> 15:16.850
Oh, my Godfather!
I got in!

15:16.890 --> 15:18.120
Don't just sit there, "congra" me!

15:18.150 --> 15:21.060
Congra!

15:21.090 --> 15:23.960
So, why was your packet
so much bigger than mine?

15:23.990 --> 15:26.900
Mmm. I don't know.

15:28.830 --> 15:30.100
Oh, it's just says a bunch of stuff about

15:30.130 --> 15:32.030
how I qualify for a scholarship.

15:32.070 --> 15:34.870
Wow. I never thought
you'd qualify for anything

15:34.900 --> 15:36.140
starting with
the word "scholar."

15:37.910 --> 15:39.140
I wonder why I didn't qualify.

15:39.170 --> 15:43.840
Uh, I don't know.
Here's the phone number to the school.

15:43.880 --> 15:44.880
Call and ask them.

15:46.150 --> 15:48.920
CeCe, that's not the phone number.

15:48.950 --> 15:50.120
That's how much the school costs.

15:51.990 --> 15:52.950
To go to or to build?

16:00.990 --> 16:03.860
We're so proud of you
for getting into CFA, honey.

16:03.900 --> 16:05.070
That's right, that's right.

16:05.100 --> 16:08.100
I bragged to one of
my patients for two hours.

16:08.140 --> 16:10.040
Of course, he was under anesthesia,

16:10.070 --> 16:12.870
and his liver was sitting up on his chest,

16:12.910 --> 16:14.040
but it really touched his heart.

16:14.080 --> 16:17.110
Well, I know I touched his heart.

16:17.150 --> 16:18.850
Rocky, we have something to tell you

16:18.880 --> 16:20.950
and thought it best
if it happened in public.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.750
Yeah, so you don't freak out.

16:24.790 --> 16:25.950
I can't believe it.
You're gonna have another baby?

16:25.990 --> 16:29.920
No! No, this factory
is officially closed.

16:32.830 --> 16:34.960
Well, then, what is it?
Just tell me. I won't freak out.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.800
We can't afford to send you to CFA.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.900
No! No, no, no.
This is not happening.

16:39.930 --> 16:41.870
I cannot hear you!
La-la-la-la-la...

16:44.040 --> 16:48.010
Ugh, I can't think of
anything for my bucket list!

16:48.040 --> 16:53.010
Why did I have to achieve all of my
life's goals at such a young age?

16:53.050 --> 16:54.010
Come on, there's got to be
something you want to do

16:54.050 --> 16:57.080
before we get vaporized by this meteor!

16:59.050 --> 17:02.020
Well, there is one thing,
but it's a trifle silly.

17:02.060 --> 17:04.990
My family is Scottish,
and I always imagined

17:05.030 --> 17:06.060
that I'd learn to play the bagpipes,

17:06.089 --> 17:06.859
while wearing a traditional kilt.

17:08.960 --> 17:09.960
Well, seeing you in a man skirt

17:10.000 --> 17:12.770
certainly wasn't on my bucket list...

17:13.030 --> 17:15.900
But it is now!

17:17.910 --> 17:20.770
As hard as it is to say no, we can't do it.

17:21.839 --> 17:24.980
I'll give up my allowance.

17:25.010 --> 17:26.910
No.
I'll never buy clothes again.

17:26.950 --> 17:28.780
No.
I'll get a part time job.

17:29.790 --> 17:31.220
No.
No.

17:31.250 --> 17:34.020
Wow. You guys are a lot better at
saying no than you think you are.

17:37.160 --> 17:40.000
CeCe, I can't go to CFA.
I begged, I cried,

17:40.030 --> 17:42.800
I promised to do better in school,

17:42.830 --> 17:44.130
but of course, we all
know that's not possible.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.900
Bottom line is, they just can't afford it.

17:49.940 --> 17:52.940
What if I give you half my scholarship?

17:52.980 --> 17:54.180
Then how will you pay for the other half?

17:55.010 --> 17:56.880
Hmm.

17:56.910 --> 17:58.910
Oh, wait. I know!
You can give me half of your scholarship.

18:03.190 --> 18:05.850
Okay. Look,

18:05.890 --> 18:07.920
my parents are gonna talk to the
Dean tomorrow about financial aid.

18:07.960 --> 18:09.860
But they told me not to get my hopes up.

18:09.890 --> 18:12.060
We're a double income family.

18:12.100 --> 18:14.930
Hey, what if they thought

18:14.960 --> 18:19.840
you were a single parent household
with a single income, like me?

18:19.870 --> 18:20.770
Okay, I don't know what you're thinking,

18:20.800 --> 18:23.740
but I recognize that look in your eyes.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.770
It's that look you get right before
you come up with some crazy idea,

18:25.810 --> 18:27.010
and I get grounded.

18:28.940 --> 18:30.110
Don't worry if you get grounded,

18:30.150 --> 18:31.910
according to Henry,
the longest it can last is

18:31.950 --> 18:33.850
17 hours, 26 minutes and 11 seconds.

18:51.970 --> 18:53.870
Before Rocky's dad gets here,

18:53.900 --> 18:55.100
there's something we need to tell you.

18:55.140 --> 18:57.840
The thing is...

18:57.870 --> 18:58.810
I know it says on my application

18:58.840 --> 19:01.010
that I come from a double income household,

19:01.040 --> 19:03.080
but it's not true.

19:03.110 --> 19:04.910
My mom walked out on us years ago.

19:06.880 --> 19:09.020
All she left behind was a note saying,

19:09.050 --> 19:11.890
"I need to find myself, and I'm moving

19:11.920 --> 19:14.820
"to a remote village in Micronesia

19:14.860 --> 19:21.060
"where there's no access to telephones or Internet.
Or even a postal system."

19:21.100 --> 19:25.770
That's awful. You know, my father
wanted to walk out on us...

19:25.800 --> 19:28.940
Mama wouldn't let him.

19:28.970 --> 19:31.110
But wait, why didn't you just
put this on your application?

19:31.140 --> 19:34.980
Because my father, he refuses
to admit that she's gone.

19:35.010 --> 19:40.750
Yeah, he actually pretends
she's still around.

19:40.790 --> 19:43.850
And we all go along with it because...
We don't want to upset him.

19:43.890 --> 19:44.990
Sad, but true.

19:47.930 --> 19:49.960
Well, on the bright side, this information

19:49.990 --> 19:54.100
does open up a new possibility
of a scholarship.

19:54.130 --> 19:55.870
Really? I had no idea.

19:57.870 --> 19:59.040
Hi, girls.

19:59.070 --> 20:01.870
Hi, I'm Dr. Curtis Blue.

20:01.910 --> 20:03.910
My apologies, but my wife won't
be able to make it today.

20:03.940 --> 20:05.110
She's having car problems.

20:05.140 --> 20:07.180
Car problems.

20:10.880 --> 20:13.120
So, Mr. Taussig,
I wanted to talk to you

20:13.150 --> 20:15.090
about reconsidering
Rocky for a scholarship.

20:15.120 --> 20:17.890
Her application does not
tell the whole story.

20:17.920 --> 20:20.090
No, no it doesn't.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.030
How do you do it?

20:24.060 --> 20:27.800
Saving lives all day and raising
your kids at the same time?

20:27.830 --> 20:30.800
Well, it's a challenge.
But it's not like I do it alone.

20:30.840 --> 20:32.910
Because I'm there to help
as much as he needs!

20:33.140 --> 20:34.010
Oh.

20:34.040 --> 20:38.980
No, not you, CeCe.
My wife, Marcie.

20:39.010 --> 20:41.180
Sure, we're like two ships
passing in the night.

20:41.220 --> 20:43.950
I work nights, and rush home
to have breakfast with her,

20:43.990 --> 20:45.950
only to find that she's long gone.

20:45.990 --> 20:47.190
Long gone.

20:50.190 --> 20:53.900
Curtis, I never do this,

20:53.930 --> 20:55.230
but may I give you a hug?

20:58.100 --> 21:01.870
Oh! This is
a progressive school.

21:01.900 --> 21:05.040
I'm here!
Sorry I'm late.

21:05.070 --> 21:07.040
Someone let the air out of my tires.

21:07.080 --> 21:09.940
It's a miracle!
She's come home!

21:12.180 --> 21:15.950
Mom, you've come back!
I missed you so much.

21:15.980 --> 21:18.080
How was your trip back from Micronesia?

21:18.120 --> 21:20.790
What are you talking about, Rocky?
I came from downtown.

21:20.820 --> 21:22.050
Downtown Micronesia...

21:27.890 --> 21:30.130
I'm grounded for a month.

21:30.160 --> 21:32.100
I'm grounded for two
months, and technically,

21:32.130 --> 21:35.900
I can't come into
your apartment ever again.

21:37.940 --> 21:42.980
Look, if you can't go to CFA,
then I'm not going to CFA.

21:43.010 --> 21:45.910
It just wouldn't be the same without you.

21:45.950 --> 21:48.850
Don't even bother trying to change my mind.

21:48.880 --> 21:49.950
He took away your scholarship, right?

21:49.980 --> 21:51.120
And my acceptance.

21:53.120 --> 21:54.150
Me too.

21:54.190 --> 21:55.990
But on the bright side,

21:56.020 --> 21:58.020
Mr. Taussig was very impressed
with our performance,

21:58.060 --> 22:00.130
and said we should
audition again next year.

22:00.250 --> 22:01.710
For the drama department.

22:06.980 --> 22:09.850
Forty-two seconds
until the meteor hits.

22:09.890 --> 22:12.820
If I had to come to an untimely end,

22:12.860 --> 22:14.720
I'm glad it's with you, Flynn.

22:14.760 --> 22:14.820
I love you, man.

22:22.100 --> 22:24.000
Don't you have something to say to me?

22:24.030 --> 22:27.940
Fine. I love you too, Henry.
Now, count us down.

22:30.140 --> 22:32.080
Five, four,

22:32.110 --> 22:32.140
three, two...

22:39.080 --> 22:42.890
At what point do we realize
the meteor's not coming

22:42.920 --> 22:43.820
and we're just two dudes
hugging under a table?

22:46.890 --> 22:48.930
And here I thought being hit by a meteor

22:48.960 --> 22:50.930
was going to be the most
uncomfortable experience of the day.

22:54.800 --> 22:58.070
I'll get it, Mom!

22:58.100 --> 23:01.040
This makes no sense.
I know my calculations were correct.

23:01.070 --> 23:04.180
Check this out.
Astronaut ice cream.

23:05.850 --> 23:06.850
It's a thank you package from NASA.

23:11.120 --> 23:13.920
"Dear Flynn Jones,

23:13.950 --> 23:16.020
"Thanks for the tip about the meteor.

23:16.060 --> 23:17.990
"You saved the world.

23:18.020 --> 23:20.960
"Yours always, NASA."

23:22.900 --> 23:25.830
Great! One little case
of phone-based anxiety,

23:25.870 --> 23:28.940
and I don't even get for saving the world.

23:28.970 --> 23:30.070
I'll make you a deal.

23:30.100 --> 23:31.960
I'll tell everyone
you helped save the world

23:32.100 --> 23:34.880
if you don't tell anyone about that hug.
