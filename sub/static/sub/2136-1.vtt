00:50.342 --> 00:52.515
<i>An old man...</i>

00:53.011 --> 00:55.013
<i>...turned ninety-eight</i>

00:55.931 --> 01:00.061
<i>Won the lottery
and died the next day</i>

01:00.269 --> 01:03.318
Why is this shit on
the get-psyched mix?

01:03.522 --> 01:05.489
If I don't throw you
a curveball, you get

01:05.607 --> 01:07.530
bored and the mix
loses its intended effect.

01:07.818 --> 01:10.492
I want to get revved up and
this song isn't doing it.

01:10.696 --> 01:13.700
I defy you to crush this
chorus and not get psyched.

01:13.991 --> 01:15.163
Won't happen.

01:15.367 --> 01:16.539
Don't you think?

01:17.202 --> 01:20.376
<i>It's like rain...</i>

01:20.706 --> 01:22.333
<i>...on your wedding day</i>

01:22.541 --> 01:26.216
<i>A free ride...</i>

01:26.545 --> 01:28.218
<i>...when you've already paid</i>

01:28.714 --> 01:30.216
<i>It's good advice...</i>

01:31.174 --> 01:32.346
Help me out here!

01:32.551 --> 01:34.553
<i>...that you just didn't take</i>

01:35.053 --> 01:37.397
<i>And who would have thought?</i>

01:37.723 --> 01:40.067
<i>It figures</i>

01:40.559 --> 01:41.811
<i>Mr. Play It Safe...</i>

01:41.893 --> 01:43.065
Classic Alants.

01:43.395 --> 01:44.692
<i>...was afraid to fly</i>

01:44.771 --> 01:45.897
He was afraid.

01:47.566 --> 01:49.239
- Bring it home.
- Oh, yeah.

01:50.068 --> 01:52.912
Go home, Papi. Yes!

01:55.073 --> 01:56.916
We got our jam on now.
Jump to it!

01:57.200 --> 01:58.372
It was a dry June.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.546
It needn't be said out loud,
but we need this sale.

02:00.746 --> 02:02.714
I'm so confident
we'll close this,

02:02.831 --> 02:04.754
I'm ordering
the Pappy Van Winkle.

02:05.042 --> 02:08.387
It's pricey, but I want to
spiritually invest in our success.

02:08.586 --> 02:12.433
If you didn't order the Pappy,
I'd send you back to the car...

02:12.716 --> 02:15.094
...to listen to
the get-psyched mix again!

02:15.385 --> 02:16.386
Go over the stat sheet.

02:16.595 --> 02:19.599
Bob Williams. Married 16 years.
Wife Karen. One daughter.

02:19.890 --> 02:22.234
That's page one.
Let me hip you to page two.

02:22.434 --> 02:24.232
Daughter's name
is Skyler. Big into

02:24.353 --> 02:26.105
gymnastics. Aces
on the pommel horse.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.774
He don't just tell it,
he shows it with pictures.

02:29.066 --> 02:31.615
Everyone's searching for
something, right, Bob?

02:31.902 --> 02:33.620
Love. Success.

02:33.945 --> 02:37.415
But what's the one thing
no one can get more of?

02:38.950 --> 02:40.247
Time.

02:41.119 --> 02:42.621
And you can't fight it.

02:42.913 --> 02:45.257
Oh, you don't have to tell me.
Look at my little girl.

02:45.457 --> 02:47.459
How old is Skyler now?
Just turned nine.

02:47.751 --> 02:49.970
Nine?! Skyler's nine?!

02:50.295 --> 02:54.801
Good Lord. How old does that make all of us?
Don't answer that, Bob!

02:55.092 --> 02:56.435
I was about to answer.

02:56.635 --> 02:59.184
Soon she'll be borrowing
Karen's makeup and

02:59.262 --> 03:01.185
you'll have two beauties
on your hands!

03:01.264 --> 03:03.813
Lock the door.
It's coming. Double digits.

03:04.101 --> 03:06.061
Skyler still giving them
hell on the pommel horse?

03:06.144 --> 03:08.272
Want to see a photo? If
it's not too much trouble.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.153
Let me show you Sky.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.942
Look at her.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.777
She's really sprouted.

03:13.985 --> 03:16.158
Yeah, Skyler's
really slimming down.

03:16.488 --> 03:18.832
I'll tell you what, she's
eating really healthy.

03:19.116 --> 03:22.495
Mostly fruits and nuts.
Her choice.

03:22.619 --> 03:26.214
No telling what this girl on a
squirrel diet could end up doing.

03:26.289 --> 03:27.962
Win us the gold, make us proud?

03:28.041 --> 03:30.885
Damn right she could. I think
she's already made you proud.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.304
Guilty, my friend.

03:32.462 --> 03:35.136
Oh, guys, it goes so fast.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.726
Like a freight train on the
track, clickety-clack.

03:37.968 --> 03:40.642
Now she's got a boyfriend... a
guy you'll like, hopefully.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.390
Clickety-clack,
she's married.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.734
Clickety-clack,
she's putting you in a home!

03:47.394 --> 03:49.897
She would do it, too.
She would.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.073
Only when you forget who she is.
I'm kidding!

03:54.901 --> 03:57.324
It feels good to
laugh about Alzheimer's.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.073
You can't control time.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.418
But you can manage it.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.458
Mmm.
Bob...

04:06.246 --> 04:08.419
...the Chronoshock
Aught Thirteen.

04:08.749 --> 04:12.003
<i>Carpe diem.</i> These
babies will fly off your shelf.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.380
I know you have six
stores now, so you'll

04:14.463 --> 04:16.841
probably want a larger order
than last year's.

04:17.423 --> 04:18.425
You're kidding, right?

04:20.469 --> 04:23.063
Your business has been folded.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.107
I'm sorry?

04:25.390 --> 04:28.564
No, there's been some chatter. The
last few years have been rough.

04:28.643 --> 04:30.236
But who hasn't felt the pinch?

04:30.604 --> 04:32.356
They didn't tell you, did they?

04:33.273 --> 04:37.779
I thought you guys wanted to
grab dinner for old times' sake.

04:38.111 --> 04:43.117
Your company is closed. I hate
to be the one telling you that.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.962
I know that I can't
buy the watches because...

04:47.204 --> 04:51.550
...your company doesn't exist
anymore, but I wish I could!

04:51.792 --> 04:53.965
That's how good you guys are!

04:54.211 --> 04:57.636
One round of Pappy Van Winkle.
Enjoy, gentlemen.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.300
Oh.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.644
Wow. That is
expensive stuff.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.812
You know, Bob, uh...

05:05.722 --> 05:06.723
...do you mind...

05:06.973 --> 05:08.975
Say no more. I'm doing this.

05:09.226 --> 05:11.399
Let's slice the pie three ways.

05:11.645 --> 05:14.649
That's silly.
I'm doing really, really...

05:14.981 --> 05:18.861
really well right now and
you guys are not... at all.

05:18.944 --> 05:19.991
Let me do this.

05:20.403 --> 05:21.563
Let's just split it.
Go Dutch.

05:21.613 --> 05:22.705
Okay.

05:22.781 --> 05:25.660
Let's be three Dutchmen. But
this Dutchman's going to pay

05:25.742 --> 05:27.710
when he can in a couple weeks.

05:28.787 --> 05:30.130
What the fuck, Sammy?

05:30.330 --> 05:32.424
What the fuck me?
What the fuck you!

05:32.499 --> 05:33.751
Who told you you could
barge into my office

05:33.834 --> 05:34.881
without an appointment?

05:35.001 --> 05:36.844
You closed the company?!

05:37.045 --> 05:39.264
Then you send us out on a
sale we really needed and had

05:39.339 --> 05:41.216
Bob Williams
drop that bomb on us?!

05:41.508 --> 05:43.931
Bob Williams' got
a big fucking mouth.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.394
Yeah, he does.

05:45.929 --> 05:48.557
Forget the sale. Nobody
wears a watch anymore...

05:48.640 --> 05:49.892
they check their phones.

05:49.975 --> 05:51.443
Disagree.
Cite your source.

05:51.518 --> 05:52.815
Kids, maybe.
There's a broader market.

05:52.894 --> 05:53.986
Lorraine, what time is it?

05:55.605 --> 05:56.652
10:26.

05:57.274 --> 06:00.528
One hip pioneering secretary
does not a cultural trend make.

06:00.819 --> 06:04.494
She's 75. Watches are
obsolete, and so are you two.

06:04.739 --> 06:06.241
Obsolete?
What does that mean?

06:06.491 --> 06:08.744
It means everything's
computerized now!

06:09.077 --> 06:11.500
It's cheaper for a machine
to tell companies

06:11.663 --> 06:14.086
what to order than
a manufacturer's rep.

06:14.416 --> 06:17.420
No, people have a deep
mistrust of machines.

06:17.752 --> 06:19.754
Have you seen "Terminator"?

06:20.005 --> 06:21.473
Or "Two"?
Or "Three"? Or "Four"?

06:21.590 --> 06:23.092
Yep. Mmm-hmm.
All of them.

06:23.425 --> 06:26.599
People want to deal with
people, not Terminators.

06:26.845 --> 06:29.769
People hate people!
Times have changed.

06:30.015 --> 06:31.358
That's so negative.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.604
Luckily I saw this coming, cashed
out, bought a condo in Miami...

06:34.853 --> 06:37.948
...new tits for the wife. Silicone.
It's legal again.

06:38.189 --> 06:39.691
Saline's out?

06:39.941 --> 06:42.114
Me and the old lady
will be tucked away nice.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.362
Great for you, huh?
Perfect.

06:44.946 --> 06:47.119
So that's it, right?

06:47.616 --> 06:49.459
But what about us, Sammy?

06:50.285 --> 06:52.959
You two were great
salesmen. The best!

06:53.204 --> 06:55.298
But at the end of the day,
you're grinders.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.543
Foot soldiers.
You'll never be generals.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.294
I'm going to say
something harsh now.

06:59.544 --> 07:01.105
Now you're going to
say something harsh?

07:01.296 --> 07:03.640
Strap it in, 'cause it
ain't pretty out there.

07:03.965 --> 07:05.558
And you two are dinosaurs.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.478
Face it. Where you're going...

07:09.220 --> 07:10.893
...you've already been.

07:12.307 --> 07:13.980
Thank you for your service.

07:19.564 --> 07:21.532
What are we going to do?

07:22.025 --> 07:23.527
I don't know.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.954
But I have to
worry about the now.

07:26.029 --> 07:28.452
I don't know what I'm going
to say to Megan.

07:34.871 --> 07:36.748
<i>It's like rain...</i>

07:36.831 --> 07:38.799
No. Let it play.

07:39.209 --> 07:42.213
For the love of God,
let it play.

07:42.921 --> 07:46.266
<i>It's a free ride
when you've already paid</i>

07:46.716 --> 07:48.059
Go.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.855
<i>Megan, let's talk about this.</i>

07:52.931 --> 07:55.980
Is it because I'm too unselfish in bed?
I can change.

07:56.059 --> 07:58.653
It won't be easy,
but I'll do it.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.446
It's always darkest
before the dawn.

08:00.522 --> 08:02.991
No, Billy. It's actually darkest
in the middle of the night.

08:03.066 --> 08:05.489
Enough's going on without
arguing about proverbs.

08:05.568 --> 08:08.663
I knew things weren't great, but to
come home to a foreclosure sign?

08:08.738 --> 08:11.161
Can we hug? Can I touch it? No!

08:11.241 --> 08:14.336
I could have avoided this if the
Bob Williams deal hadn't gone bad.

08:14.411 --> 08:15.412
You blew that?

08:15.495 --> 08:18.465
Not so much that I blew it
as the company shut down

08:18.540 --> 08:19.666
and took our jobs away.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.628
Sweetheart, I promise
I can pay for all of this.

08:22.711 --> 08:25.885
It's not about the money, Billy.
This is about you.

08:25.964 --> 08:29.093
You talk a big game, but
never do anything about it!

08:29.175 --> 08:31.655
You say we'll go to Spain... but
have I ever been to Barcelona?

08:31.678 --> 08:34.022
Barthelona! And not
yet, but we're going.

08:35.849 --> 08:36.850
What?

08:38.934 --> 08:41.279
We are not going to Barthelona.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.981
We discussed going
to Barthelona...

08:43.063 --> 08:46.238
...but we are never
going to go to Barthelona.

08:46.317 --> 08:48.319
Not with that
attitude we're not.

08:48.445 --> 08:50.368
Do you even hear yourself? Yes.

08:50.447 --> 08:53.075
I'm glad you said some of that...
we're in a relationship and

08:53.158 --> 08:54.580
I'm glad we're committed to it.

08:54.659 --> 08:57.082
You know how badly
I want to believe that?

08:57.162 --> 09:00.792
Because I've been with you a long
time and nothing ever gets better.

09:01.416 --> 09:02.463
Honey, you're...

09:02.834 --> 09:04.711
You're such a great guy...

09:04.794 --> 09:08.264
...but you always screw things
up and let people down.

09:09.132 --> 09:12.853
Billy, I love you, but I'm
tired of being let down.

09:19.517 --> 09:22.145
That's terrible,
Nicky. Are you okay?

09:22.228 --> 09:26.074
I should have gone on my own
when I had the chance. Stupid!

09:26.149 --> 09:29.403
You did the right thing. Got
a paycheck, played it smart.

09:29.569 --> 09:30.821
Dad would have been proud.

09:30.987 --> 09:34.457
Proud of what? I didn't play it smart.
I played it safe.

09:34.532 --> 09:37.206
Look where I am now.
Proud?

09:37.660 --> 09:40.129
At your nephew's Little League game.
Cheer up!

09:40.705 --> 09:41.797
Come on.

09:41.873 --> 09:43.170
All right, Tate!

09:43.249 --> 09:45.593
Here we go, Tate!
Put some wood on it!

09:45.794 --> 09:46.920
He's a great kid.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.347
I keep telling you
you'd be a terrific father.

09:49.464 --> 09:51.762
Yep, you do keep telling me that.

09:51.841 --> 09:54.594
Unfortunately, it would require
having a relationship lasting longer

09:54.677 --> 09:56.179
than three months.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.264
I'm not sure
it would require that.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.267
Let me call Kevin.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.193
I'm sure your
boyfriend's great,

10:02.268 --> 10:04.111
but I don't want
to work for someone...

10:04.187 --> 10:06.360
...who spent all
last Thanksgiving

10:06.439 --> 10:08.112
explaining the meaning
of his tattoo.

10:08.525 --> 10:11.028
Be reasonable, Nicky.
Take the job.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.201
What else are you going to do?

10:13.655 --> 10:15.703
That's it. Just
take the walk, Eagle Eye.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.125
Walk's as good
as a hit, come on.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.627
What is this guy saying?
Bullshit.

10:19.702 --> 10:22.330
Nick. Nick! Walk's not
as good as a hit.

10:22.413 --> 10:24.461
It's not as good
as a double or a triple.

10:24.541 --> 10:25.838
It's not as good as a dinger.

10:25.917 --> 10:28.420
Go on, take a big cut, Tate.
Nick!

10:28.920 --> 10:30.547
Get off the field.
What are you doing?

10:30.880 --> 10:32.974
You're calling him Eagle Eye
to get him not to swing?

10:33.299 --> 10:35.301
Come on, he's 12 years old.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.349
He's got the rest
of his life to take a walk.

10:37.428 --> 10:39.556
How about you take a walk, pal?
And get off my field!

10:39.681 --> 10:41.433
Just stop calling him
Eagle Eye, okay?

10:41.516 --> 10:42.938
Oh, I'm gonna
call him Eagle Eye.

10:43.059 --> 10:44.652
Oh, no, you're not. Yes, I am.

10:44.894 --> 10:46.817
You're Eagle Eye.
Want a piece of me?

10:52.485 --> 10:54.829
- Go ahead, Tate. Swing!
- Let him go.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.906
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.960
Play ball. Come on, Tate.
Swing big!

11:06.958 --> 11:10.428
Read "Moneyball," asshole.
Walks are as good as hits.

11:14.757 --> 11:17.510
Just when you think your
day couldn't get any worse,

11:17.594 --> 11:19.096
it got worse.

11:19.304 --> 11:20.647
I feel like my day
bent me over,

11:20.722 --> 11:22.599
put a ball in my mouth
and fucked me bad.

11:24.434 --> 11:27.028
Is it just me, or does life look
a lot like those hillbillies

11:27.103 --> 11:28.696
from "Deliverance" now?

11:28.771 --> 11:30.648
It's got me over
by the tree there,

11:30.732 --> 11:32.405
just told me
I had a pretty mouth.

11:32.734 --> 11:35.487
You over, squealing like
a pig on all fours.

11:36.696 --> 11:39.040
I'm looking, where's Burt
Reynolds with the crossbow?

11:39.115 --> 11:40.241
He's not coming.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.498
We're there.
It's gonna happen.

11:42.911 --> 11:45.164
You're gonna get raped.
You know what it is?

11:45.538 --> 11:47.256
I feel like
life's inside of me.

11:47.332 --> 11:50.552
Just working, just pushing.
Just going all after it.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.754
And all of a sudden,
life pulls out.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.237
But he's gonna
scurry up the pillow.

11:54.464 --> 11:56.637
Boom, just explodes
right in my fucking mouth.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.431
How are you?

11:59.636 --> 12:01.354
Hey.
Hey, cute kid.

12:01.763 --> 12:02.855
How old is she?

12:03.139 --> 12:04.891
She's a boy.
Okay.

12:05.308 --> 12:06.730
Still very attractive.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.569
Without pink or blue,
it's hard to tell,

12:08.645 --> 12:09.726
but the features are great,

12:09.729 --> 12:10.981
maybe put him in some modeling.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.791
That's what they're going for,
that right-down -the-middle thing.

12:14.025 --> 12:17.404
How many different ways do
we have to say, "I give up"?

12:17.528 --> 12:21.203
Say "Uncle," Say "Mercy," before
life stops whaling away on us.

12:21.282 --> 12:23.080
I mean, we are getting pounded.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.537
I feel like our whole
generation of sheep

12:25.620 --> 12:27.748
has been sold
a bad bill of goods.

12:27.830 --> 12:31.130
We were told, "Go to
college, get good grades."

12:31.209 --> 12:33.052
Wait, you didn't go to college.

12:33.127 --> 12:34.970
I'm saying in theory,
in concept,

12:35.046 --> 12:37.174
our generation was told
that you go to college,

12:37.257 --> 12:39.760
you get a job,
you get a mortgage,

12:39.842 --> 12:42.595
and here we did everything the way we
were supposed to, and what do we get?

12:42.679 --> 12:44.022
Where's our thanks?
Nothing.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.767
I'm gonna call Kevin
about that job.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.482
Kevin?
Thanksgiving tattoo?

12:51.854 --> 12:53.276
We're not that low,
are we, Nick?

13:25.805 --> 13:28.228
Show me one
little something here.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.238
What are you
going to do, Billy?

14:27.992 --> 14:30.836
There he is!
Nickrophiliac! Hey.

14:32.413 --> 14:33.756
How you been?
Good.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.124
Just working away.

14:35.249 --> 14:36.341
I see that.

14:36.667 --> 14:40.672
Don't slag off on the corners.
They are so important.

14:41.005 --> 14:43.508
People track shit
in here all the time.

14:43.841 --> 14:46.845
And I mean literally dog shit.

14:47.095 --> 14:48.267
Jesus!

14:48.513 --> 14:49.856
I should have worn gloves.
Huh?

14:50.098 --> 14:51.378
I said I should
have worn gloves.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.608
They won't help.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.523
You don't want protector duty?

14:54.769 --> 14:58.364
'Cause I can put you out at the
curb, twirling the big arrow.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.449
Hot sun beating down on you?

15:00.691 --> 15:02.318
I've lost three guys
to skin cancer!

15:02.485 --> 15:04.112
We call that curb
"the widowmaker."

15:04.362 --> 15:06.205
I don't want to go
out to the widowmaker.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.870
How would you fare out there,
with that alabaster skin?

15:09.117 --> 15:10.460
I don't know.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.096
I'll tell you.
You'd be dead in a year.

15:14.705 --> 15:15.745
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Jeggings.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.383
Jeggings, five o'clock.

15:18.126 --> 15:19.423
Where?
Right there.

15:20.503 --> 15:23.757
I'd like to play around in that
rumpus room, you know what I mean?

15:24.048 --> 15:26.050
Have you done the back door yet?
What?

15:26.175 --> 15:28.269
Back door?
Back door action?

15:28.845 --> 15:32.019
"Knock-knock.
It's me."

15:32.098 --> 15:33.350
"With my penis."

15:34.517 --> 15:37.521
A life changer.
It is a life changer!

15:37.687 --> 15:40.941
You VIP your way
into that back alley,

15:41.023 --> 15:43.276
you'll never think about
the main entrance anymore.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.032
You know what I mean
by the main entrance?

15:45.111 --> 15:48.240
We're talking dick
into the vagina.

15:48.865 --> 15:51.163
This is
an awkward conversation.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.958
Why? Because you're
dating my sister!

15:54.036 --> 15:58.291
Oh! Yeah. Well, don't think we didn't
go through a period of adjustment.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.459
Adjustment?

15:59.709 --> 16:01.052
Can you gentlemen help me?

16:01.294 --> 16:03.092
Yes.
Nick is one of our best.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.891
In fact, his entire family knows
their way around a mattress.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.219
Get it!

16:11.012 --> 16:14.516
My question is about memory
foam versus standard...

16:14.765 --> 16:17.769
...specifically as it
relates to lumbar support.

16:17.852 --> 16:19.024
What?

16:19.103 --> 16:20.104
Lumbar support.

16:20.438 --> 16:24.113
Great choice of mattress. Why
don't you lie down there?

16:24.442 --> 16:26.410
Let's work our way through this

16:26.527 --> 16:28.450
conundrum. What I
think you're asking...

16:29.280 --> 16:31.032
Billy, I'm with a customer.

16:31.282 --> 16:33.034
Maybe start off on this.

16:33.284 --> 16:34.410
Yeah, just lie down.

16:34.535 --> 16:35.627
Come here for a second.

16:36.245 --> 16:37.337
What are you doing here?

16:37.413 --> 16:39.711
I've seen the future and
it is beautiful for us!

16:39.957 --> 16:43.382
I don't know what you got, but I got
a job and I don't want to lose it.

16:43.461 --> 16:44.633
Can we discuss this later?

16:44.712 --> 16:47.465
No. The future
doesn't know later.

16:47.715 --> 16:50.218
What? All the future is
is later.

16:50.468 --> 16:53.722
That's literally what the future is.
What are you talking about?

16:54.138 --> 16:55.139
Google.

16:56.641 --> 16:58.985
The place is amazing.
They have nap pods,

16:59.101 --> 17:01.479
massage rooms,
a volleyball court.

17:01.729 --> 17:05.074
It's ranked as the greatest
place to work at in America!

17:05.316 --> 17:08.490
It's a technology company... a
field we know jack squat about.

17:08.736 --> 17:11.579
Look, Google needs us.
And Google wants us.

17:11.821 --> 17:15.998
They do? You sweet son of a bitch!
You got us jobs at Google?!

17:16.243 --> 17:17.587
Well, it's not actually a job.

17:17.828 --> 17:18.920
What do you mean?

17:19.163 --> 17:20.756
Oh, it's an interview for
an internship that has

17:20.830 --> 17:23.505
a better-than-not chance of
materializing into a job.

17:23.751 --> 17:26.174
Now you are
making me very angry!

17:26.420 --> 17:28.047
You want me to leave my job...

17:28.130 --> 17:29.882
...to go for an interview,
not for a job, but for

17:29.966 --> 17:32.970
an internship that may or
may not lead to a job?

17:33.594 --> 17:36.268
Aren't you tired of asking
for just enough to get by?

17:36.514 --> 17:38.187
Yes.
I want to do something...

17:38.432 --> 17:40.685
...that matters.
I want to have a life

17:40.810 --> 17:43.108
I'm excited about
and that's great.

17:43.354 --> 17:45.573
Nick, I want us to
go to California.

17:45.690 --> 17:47.943
And I want us to get
these jobs at Google.

17:48.359 --> 17:50.361
I'm going to
speak to a manager.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.454
Terrific!
He's right over there.

17:52.697 --> 17:54.699
Let's roll over
onto the stomach.

17:55.032 --> 17:56.329
He'll be very helpful.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.628
What we're going to
do is get a little

17:58.703 --> 18:01.957
support for the hips. Imagine
a pillow right there.

18:02.206 --> 18:05.210
Then we separate the feet.
Create a little heat dispersion.

18:05.459 --> 18:06.802
Excuse me!

18:07.128 --> 18:09.631
Is there something
I can help you with?!

18:09.714 --> 18:11.762
What?!

18:11.966 --> 18:13.309
I'm trying to buy a mattress.

18:13.634 --> 18:14.806
Unbelievable!

18:15.052 --> 18:19.228
Our interview's in one hour. This
might be the last chance we got.

18:19.473 --> 18:21.100
How's it going, Gossip Girls?

18:21.183 --> 18:22.560
C.W. just called.
You're canceled.

18:22.643 --> 18:23.769
Excuse me?

18:23.853 --> 18:26.447
You're peddling him
a bunch of crap, just like

18:26.522 --> 18:28.524
the crap merchandise
you two used to shill.

18:28.733 --> 18:30.531
So listen up, Marfan Syndrome.

18:30.693 --> 18:32.036
What?
Marfanism.

18:32.236 --> 18:34.739
Big man's disease.
The giant killer. You.

18:35.031 --> 18:36.374
We're the same height.

18:36.574 --> 18:38.417
We are not the same height.

18:38.701 --> 18:40.453
I'm handsome tall.

18:40.536 --> 18:43.210
You're the type of tall where,
you walk through the airport...

18:43.414 --> 18:45.041
people stop eating
and look at you.

18:45.249 --> 18:48.093
You're a freak. Nick, you
have a customer waiting.

18:48.419 --> 18:50.888
Nick, we have
our future waiting.

18:51.255 --> 18:52.928
Nick, you know what that says?

18:53.215 --> 18:54.717
No, I don't read Sanskrit.

18:54.925 --> 18:57.098
"Make reasonable choices."

18:57.386 --> 19:00.105
That's an odd thing to get
tattooed on your neck.

19:00.389 --> 19:02.391
Just get back to work!

19:03.893 --> 19:06.487
God! I'm sorry you
had to see that, ma'am.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.906
Now let's get back to you
and pelvic ventilation.

19:09.106 --> 19:10.278
Kevin!

19:12.234 --> 19:14.783
You've been saying insulting
things to me all day.

19:15.237 --> 19:16.363
What are you doing?

19:16.489 --> 19:17.615
Taking the shirt off.

19:17.907 --> 19:19.955
I don't know what happens
to a dream deferred.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.745
Does it dry up,
like a raisin in the sun?

19:22.953 --> 19:26.799
Or does it explode?
I don't want to find out.

19:28.584 --> 19:30.586
You just made the worst
mistake of your life.

19:30.961 --> 19:34.636
Hey, hey! You take the shirt
off, it doesn't go back on.

19:34.965 --> 19:36.638
There's not a second chance!

19:38.969 --> 19:40.186
I'll see you in hell!

19:42.640 --> 19:43.766
We're meeting
the interviewer in here?

19:43.891 --> 19:44.983
No, not in here.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.269
We're meeting him in here.
It's a Hangout.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.484
People do interviews
on the Internet.

19:49.814 --> 19:52.658
I like it.
Now it says here that the...

19:52.942 --> 19:55.286
...internship is only
for college students.

19:55.486 --> 19:59.332
Way ahead of you. I enrolled us
at the University of Phoenix.

19:59.657 --> 20:02.456
That proud online institution.
Go Fighting Phoenixes!

20:03.661 --> 20:06.164
Wait... you put my
major down as physics?

20:06.497 --> 20:10.218
Why? I don't know shit about physics.
Physics scares me.

20:10.543 --> 20:13.217
These guys paint
the corner of the plate.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.389
They won't go down the middle
and ask about physics.

20:15.631 --> 20:17.474
Too obvious.
I took it off the table.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.515
Good.
Hide in plain sight.

20:19.593 --> 20:23.143
But you put
down sales as your major?

20:23.305 --> 20:25.979
Because I'm a talker.
I figure I should dazzle.

20:26.225 --> 20:29.570
I thought about this...
hide your vacancy and let me dazzle.

20:30.146 --> 20:31.819
Are you done?
There's a 15-minute limit.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.905
Sorry... the big boys need the
computer a little longer.

20:35.151 --> 20:38.496
But we can make this a win-win
for you... go get a soda.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.331
Put some sugar in your body.

20:41.115 --> 20:42.116
Enjoy it.

20:42.491 --> 20:43.583
Cute kid.

20:44.076 --> 20:47.421
Here they are. When I hit this,
they'll be able to see us.

20:47.621 --> 20:48.964
Get in close so
they can see us.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.750
The webcam's small.
Come here.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.426
Don't crowd me.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.011
Get cheek to cheek.
I get you.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.426
They can't see us.
I understand that.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.595
Put your fucking cheek next to mine!
I get it!

20:58.674 --> 20:59.891
We can see you guys!

21:00.134 --> 21:02.637
Okay, great! Hi!
My name is Billy!

21:02.845 --> 21:04.472
We can hear you fine as well.

21:04.680 --> 21:05.681
Oh, great.
Good.

21:05.973 --> 21:07.520
Billy McMahon.
Nick Campbell.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.151
I'm Benjamin.
Allison.

21:09.351 --> 21:10.352
We're thirsty, too.

21:10.644 --> 21:13.864
Slow down, camper. I'm not an ATM.
I have a job interview here.

21:14.315 --> 21:15.658
We'll be back.

21:16.025 --> 21:17.698
Are you in a library?

21:17.943 --> 21:20.446
We are. Some beautiful
little kids here.

21:20.696 --> 21:23.449
A program we're involved in.
We take suburban kids

21:23.532 --> 21:25.705
and teach them what
it's like to be homeless.

21:25.951 --> 21:26.952
What's it called?

21:27.286 --> 21:28.287
It's called, uh...

21:28.412 --> 21:29.459
Attitude Adjustment.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.085
We're helping the kids.

21:31.165 --> 21:34.385
We did our interview here so
we could help out, and also

21:34.460 --> 21:36.303
we don't have webcams
on our computer.

21:36.462 --> 21:38.464
If you don't have
a webcam on your

21:38.589 --> 21:40.637
computer, how do you do coding?

21:40.883 --> 21:42.226
Coding?

21:42.468 --> 21:44.812
Under "computer skills",
you put "C++".

21:45.054 --> 21:46.556
That's actually a C+.

21:46.889 --> 21:50.735
The second plus reflects my attitude
of how I felt about the C+.

21:50.976 --> 21:53.274
It was a typing class. Same
principle, just no engine

21:53.354 --> 21:55.607
in the baby.
More like "quick brown fox".

21:55.815 --> 21:58.238
Put your hands in the basin.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.160
But that helped me when
I started my journey into

22:00.236 --> 22:03.331
computers, because I knew
where to put my hands.

22:03.405 --> 22:05.999
Okay, let's focus on
this... you're currently

22:06.075 --> 22:07.918
enrolled at the University
of Phoenix online?

22:08.327 --> 22:09.579
Yes, we are.

22:09.745 --> 22:10.997
Damn right we are.

22:11.247 --> 22:13.500
It's the oldest
institution of its kind.

22:13.582 --> 22:16.256
Many people refer to it as the
Harvard of Internet colleges.

22:16.502 --> 22:18.095
Oh! I hadn't heard that.

22:18.254 --> 22:19.847
No, that has not
made it out here.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.298
That reputation.

22:21.423 --> 22:22.595
Well, we're Phoenix proud.

22:22.675 --> 22:25.554
That's fine. We're going
to ask you some questions

22:25.636 --> 22:27.183
some of our candidates
find a bit odd.

22:27.513 --> 22:29.356
Let's get weird!
No judgment. Shoot.

22:29.598 --> 22:33.523
You're shrunken down to the size of
nickels and dropped into a blender.

22:33.602 --> 22:34.694
What do you do?

22:34.770 --> 22:37.023
Is anything else
in the blender?

22:37.356 --> 22:38.608
Uh, I don't know.

22:38.858 --> 22:41.702
It makes a difference. Are there ice cubes?
Is this a daiquiri?

22:41.944 --> 22:43.446
Is there rum?
Is it a smoothie?

22:43.696 --> 22:46.620
It's been a long week... maybe these
little guys want to live a little.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.709
Okay, let's say it's empty.

22:48.993 --> 22:50.336
In that case, it's easy.

22:50.411 --> 22:51.458
Why?

22:51.537 --> 22:55.041
If we're nickel-size and the
blender's empty, we go on our backs.

22:55.374 --> 22:56.375
Flat, like this.

22:56.458 --> 22:57.630
Enjoy that breeze.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.383
Stiff as a board,
light as a feather.

22:59.628 --> 23:01.471
Like it's a fan.
Let the wind whip.

23:04.300 --> 23:05.392
Like getting an MRI.

23:05.634 --> 23:06.635
Once the blender's on,
it's on forever.

23:06.802 --> 23:07.803
Forever.

23:08.053 --> 23:11.057
Respectfully, I have to disagree.
We sold blenders...

23:11.307 --> 23:14.311
...and even the best model
only runs non-stop for, what?

23:14.560 --> 23:15.982
Even the Germans...

23:16.228 --> 23:19.823
Yeah, even a Braun will only run
non-stop for 10 or 11 hours.

23:20.065 --> 23:21.908
So we'll get out and when
we do, we're better off,

23:21.984 --> 23:24.078
because what doesn't kill
you makes you stronger.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.414
I'd like to big-picture
this for a second.

23:26.655 --> 23:29.408
Just like the founders of Google.
Big-picture Googling.

23:29.742 --> 23:32.086
It's not so much
getting out of the blender...

23:32.328 --> 23:35.081
...as what happens next.
That's the question.

23:35.331 --> 23:39.677
Two nickel-sized men free in the world.
Think of the possibilities.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.512
Off the top of my head...

23:41.754 --> 23:43.097
My head's swimming.

23:43.213 --> 23:44.653
Sunglass repair?
Those little screws.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.638
Put us in those
submarines they put

23:46.759 --> 23:48.511
in people's bodies
to fight diseases.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.513
That's cutting edge.

23:50.679 --> 23:52.431
Okay, that's not real,
the submarines.

23:52.681 --> 23:56.185
Wait... we were stuck in a blender,
now we're saving lives. What?!

23:56.435 --> 23:57.527
What?

23:57.686 --> 23:59.108
What?
What?

23:59.271 --> 24:02.115
I'll recap. We started in a
blender, now we're saving lives!

24:02.232 --> 24:03.358
What?!

24:03.609 --> 24:04.610
What?

24:04.860 --> 24:08.535
Wait a minute! We were stuck in a
blender and now we're saving lives?!

24:08.781 --> 24:10.783
You guys led us to this.
Thank you.

24:11.033 --> 24:12.330
I think we've gotten
a little far afield.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.703
A little off-topic.

24:13.953 --> 24:16.126
I'll get inside you
and I'll fight for you.

24:16.372 --> 24:17.669
Thank you.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.042
Which one of you is physics?

24:19.291 --> 24:23.467
Mr. Campbell? Maybe you could
expound on this from a physics aspect.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.139
Physics.

24:27.049 --> 24:29.973
Listen, I could bend
your ear about physics...

24:30.219 --> 24:34.224
...and physical phenomena, but the
truth is, we were in a blender.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.317
We'd lost our jobs,
and we'd given up.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.734
So we already answered the question
when we took this interview.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.824
We got ourselves out,
and here we are.

24:44.149 --> 24:46.072
If you really want
to know what happens

24:46.235 --> 24:48.158
when you take two
guys out of a blender...

24:48.404 --> 24:50.156
I'm sorry, Allison, is it?

24:51.323 --> 24:55.078
Then give us a shot. I think
you'll be happy you did.

24:57.246 --> 24:58.964
Who is our next applicant?

24:59.289 --> 25:01.587
Ah, our two daiquiri men.

25:01.792 --> 25:04.295
So what do
we think? Dana?

25:04.628 --> 25:07.131
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

25:07.631 --> 25:08.632
Eleanor?

25:08.966 --> 25:12.140
Hmm. They seem like really nice
guys, but I don't think so.

25:12.428 --> 25:13.395
Okay! Moving on.

25:13.470 --> 25:14.562
Can I say something?

25:14.638 --> 25:16.640
You can. We will
resent you for wasting

25:16.765 --> 25:18.813
our time, but don't
let that stop you.

25:19.101 --> 25:22.275
It's just... diversity
is in our DNA, right?

25:22.479 --> 25:23.919
I thought the goal
was to find people

25:23.939 --> 25:25.316
with a different
way of thinking.

25:25.607 --> 25:28.281
That doesn't mean
we have to hire them.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.283
Very good point, Dana.
Moving on!

25:30.487 --> 25:33.832
You read their resumes,
right? They have more years...

25:34.116 --> 25:35.709
...of sales and
life experience than

25:35.826 --> 25:37.453
the age of most of our interns.

25:37.661 --> 25:41.131
Plus, our final judgment is
always based on the Layover Test.

25:41.623 --> 25:44.968
Who would you rather sit with at an
airport bar for a 6-hour delay?

25:45.085 --> 25:46.962
The ten millionth
kid who knows if you

25:47.046 --> 25:50.095
shrink your strength-to-weight
ratio you can jump higher? Duh.

25:50.507 --> 25:52.976
Or the out-of-the-box
thinkers who turned

25:53.093 --> 25:55.516
being stuck in
a blender into an advantage.

26:00.601 --> 26:01.978
<i>Tell me how you feel
What's your fantasy?</i>

26:02.061 --> 26:04.905
<i>I see you on the beach
down in Mexico</i>

26:05.272 --> 26:07.821
<i>You can put your feet up
Be my señorita</i>

26:07.900 --> 26:10.574
<i>We ain't gotta rush
Just take it slow</i>

26:10.652 --> 26:13.451
<i>You'll be in the high life
Soaking up the sunlight</i>

26:13.530 --> 26:15.624
<i>Anything you want is yours</i>

26:16.325 --> 26:19.249
<i>I heard you're living life
like you should</i>

26:19.328 --> 26:22.002
<i>You say you never
had it so good</i>

26:23.540 --> 26:25.383
So it begins.
Here we go.

26:25.667 --> 26:26.668
This place is incredible.

26:26.794 --> 26:27.841
Where do we check in?

26:28.045 --> 26:29.342
Let's ask somebody.

26:29.880 --> 26:32.554
Oh, excuse me!
I'm sorry, excuse me...

26:36.887 --> 26:38.013
Billy?

26:38.722 --> 26:40.895
It's scary because it's new.

26:41.183 --> 26:44.232
Let's check in. Head towards
those big, big letters.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.067
What's up, family?

26:46.897 --> 26:49.741
<i>Tell me how you feel
What's your fantasy?</i>

26:49.817 --> 26:52.570
<i>I see you on the beach
down in Mexico</i>

26:52.736 --> 26:55.455
<i>You can put your feet up
Be my señorita</i>

26:55.531 --> 26:58.205
<i>We ain't gotta rush
Just take it slow</i>

26:58.534 --> 27:01.037
<i>You'll be in the high life
Soaking up the sunlight</i>

27:01.328 --> 27:03.376
<i>Anything you want is yours</i>

27:05.082 --> 27:06.254
Name?

27:06.625 --> 27:09.845
<i>You say you never
had it so good</i>

27:13.257 --> 27:15.555
<i>You never had it so good</i>

27:18.887 --> 27:20.730
<i>You never had it so good</i>

27:21.598 --> 27:25.273
Picture the greatest amusement
park you ever went to as a kid.

27:25.561 --> 27:29.907
Now imagine a place nothing like
it and a million times better.

27:30.107 --> 27:31.950
That's where we are.

27:32.276 --> 27:35.120
I'll grab us a coffee.
You check us in.

27:42.119 --> 27:43.120
Good morning.

27:43.620 --> 27:44.792
What's the damage here?

27:44.913 --> 27:46.130
Nothing.

27:48.125 --> 27:49.798
For these?
Free.

27:50.085 --> 27:51.086
They're complimentary?

27:51.295 --> 27:53.639
Complimentary.
Free. Whatever you want.

27:54.089 --> 27:56.308
You're saying
whatever I walk away with...

27:56.592 --> 27:57.764
It's free.

27:59.261 --> 28:00.262
Have bananas.

28:00.470 --> 28:04.100
I probably should. This is the
most important meal of the day.

28:04.308 --> 28:05.605
Take two, they're free.

28:05.726 --> 28:06.978
For my day, I need it.

28:07.311 --> 28:08.813
What about the bagels
and all that?

28:08.937 --> 28:10.484
Free. Anything you want.

28:10.772 --> 28:12.991
If you're insisting,
I'll have a couple.

28:13.275 --> 28:15.323
Like four.
Just whatever it is.

28:15.611 --> 28:17.284
What about five?
Free, too.

28:17.487 --> 28:18.659
Make it seven, then.

28:18.947 --> 28:20.119
And if you want to whip
up some other drinks.

28:20.199 --> 28:22.577
Do you have a to go cup,
like a Guzzler?

28:23.827 --> 28:25.170
Excuse me.

28:25.495 --> 28:27.497
Do you know what
launch this was from?

28:27.789 --> 28:29.336
Sorry, I have a meeting.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.002
Oh, no, no, no. I don't
want to hold you. I just...

28:33.337 --> 28:36.136
I was just curious. Was this
thing actually in space?

28:36.840 --> 28:39.013
If there were only
a webpage you could go to.

28:39.343 --> 28:42.847
Where we could just type things
in and search for answers.

28:43.138 --> 28:45.186
Ah, yes, that would be nice.

28:46.683 --> 28:48.856
Nick Campbell. Intern.

28:49.519 --> 28:51.362
Dana Simms. Late.

28:52.022 --> 28:53.865
Me, too.
Have to rush off.

28:54.149 --> 28:57.653
And it's SpaceShipOne. First
private manned spaceflight.

28:57.861 --> 28:59.454
Winner of the X Prize.

29:07.204 --> 29:08.547
Are those your dads?

29:08.830 --> 29:13.552
Same-sex partners make excellent parents.
I so wish my parents were gay.

29:13.835 --> 29:15.087
When did twenty start
to look like twelve?

29:15.212 --> 29:16.509
Oh, man.

29:16.713 --> 29:18.193
Of course I'll work my hardest.

29:18.340 --> 29:21.184
Mom, how can I work harder than my hardest?
That's impossible.

29:21.385 --> 29:24.059
Okay, okay, I will.
Yes, I love you.

29:24.554 --> 29:25.555
Mom?

29:26.223 --> 29:28.225
Billy McMahon. Billy McMahon.
How are you?

29:28.892 --> 29:30.132
Oh, I'm going to
grab some food.

29:30.143 --> 29:31.235
I'm good.

29:31.478 --> 29:32.570
You all right alone?

29:35.565 --> 29:37.909
This stuff looks good, huh?
Little pick-me-up.

29:38.318 --> 29:39.410
Graham Hawtrey.

29:39.903 --> 29:41.746
I'm so thrilled to be here.
Oh, me, too.

29:41.989 --> 29:43.582
Feels kind of
like the first day of

29:43.699 --> 29:45.326
spring training
for Little League.

29:47.744 --> 29:51.840
I think I have a few more clicks
on the odometer than you kids.

29:51.957 --> 29:54.710
That's why I came over.
I said to myself,

29:54.793 --> 29:57.296
"That man has life experience.
He can teach you a lot."

29:57.379 --> 29:59.473
You have to meet
my friend, Nick. Nicky!

29:59.715 --> 30:01.467
Nickelodeon!
Come here!

30:02.217 --> 30:05.437
Meet Graham. He's in the
internship program with us.

30:05.679 --> 30:07.101
You're interns?

30:07.347 --> 30:08.769
Shut up!
Deal with it.

30:08.849 --> 30:10.476
Shut the fuck up!
Deal with it.

30:10.642 --> 30:11.985
But you're so old.

30:12.227 --> 30:13.570
Oh. Excuse me?

30:13.812 --> 30:15.655
I feel terrible!
I feel so stupid.

30:15.897 --> 30:17.991
I feel terrible.
For what?

30:18.066 --> 30:22.572
I just, you know... I thought
you were important. Oh, shit.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.745
I have to find some people who
actually matter. Good luck!

30:25.991 --> 30:28.744
Why did you bring me
over to meet that guy,

30:28.827 --> 30:30.829
like he was your best friend?
You introduced me to Hitler.

30:31.079 --> 30:33.173
He seemed sweet at first.

30:33.415 --> 30:38.012
My name is Roger Chetty. I am head
of the Google Intern Program.

30:38.086 --> 30:40.054
Welcome to Google.

30:40.589 --> 30:44.264
This will not be your
average internship. Oh, no.

30:44.593 --> 30:46.436
You will do what we do.

30:46.678 --> 30:49.682
And we will watch
how well you do it.

30:49.931 --> 30:52.275
You represent
the finest schools.

30:52.517 --> 30:55.191
Your intelligence and
achievement is well noted...

30:55.437 --> 30:57.155
...but to excel
at this internship,

30:57.230 --> 30:59.858
you're going to need
far more than brain power.

31:00.108 --> 31:01.951
What you're going to need...

31:05.405 --> 31:07.908
Nothing funny. Googliness.

31:08.241 --> 31:12.587
The intangible stuff
that made a search engine...

31:12.913 --> 31:14.756
...into an engine for change.

31:15.248 --> 31:18.252
Now, you will be
divided into teams...

31:18.543 --> 31:21.888
...and by the end of the summer
only one team...

31:22.089 --> 31:25.593
...will be guaranteed a full-time position.
The other...

31:25.926 --> 31:29.100
...95% of you... will not.

31:29.429 --> 31:31.557
You've been split up
into several seminars

31:31.640 --> 31:33.893
to acquaint you with
our campus and culture.

31:34.434 --> 31:36.732
Descriptions have
been emailed to you.

31:36.937 --> 31:40.111
I would wish you luck, but
it's not luck that you need.

31:40.607 --> 31:42.109
Get to work!

31:42.609 --> 31:46.910
This ain't gonna be about getting
coffee and running errands.

31:47.114 --> 31:49.116
It's a mental
Hunger Games against

31:49.282 --> 31:51.284
a bunch of genius kids
for a handful of jobs.

31:51.576 --> 31:53.453
So we nail it. This is
our opening statement.

31:53.745 --> 31:54.962
If it please the court.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.480
Oh, it pleases the court,
counselor.

31:56.623 --> 31:58.751
<i>Workplace Seminar.
A few seats left.</i>

31:59.918 --> 32:00.919
First impression time.

32:01.044 --> 32:02.091
Bingo!

32:02.254 --> 32:03.255
We can do good here.

32:03.463 --> 32:05.966
Shazam! So close
yet so far, boys.

32:06.299 --> 32:08.301
Whoa! Graham,
we were here first.

32:08.593 --> 32:12.143
You're right. You guys could
use the advantage. Go ahead.

32:12.472 --> 32:13.724
What does that mean?

32:14.015 --> 32:16.438
It means that in
a world of excellence,

32:16.518 --> 32:18.896
old and unexceptional
qualifies as diversity.

32:19.187 --> 32:21.360
So go ahead.
What's that saying?

32:21.565 --> 32:23.408
"Age before beauty"?

32:24.526 --> 32:25.527
Thank you.

32:25.735 --> 32:27.112
You're welcome, William!

32:27.612 --> 32:28.613
There's always

32:28.697 --> 32:31.701
some joker who likes
to play fuckaround.

32:32.117 --> 32:35.997
I guess that's you, Graham.
At least we know. Game on.

32:36.079 --> 32:37.080
Good luck, boys.

32:38.123 --> 32:41.002
Google is not
a conventional workplace.

32:41.084 --> 32:43.337
Having said that,
we have rules.

32:43.753 --> 32:45.926
I will ask you
a series of questions.

32:46.256 --> 32:49.260
You will raise the green
paddle to indicate yes...

32:49.593 --> 32:52.938
...and the red paddle
to indicate no.

32:53.305 --> 32:54.932
So, let's begin.

32:55.265 --> 32:58.269
"Having a beer
with your boss."

32:59.603 --> 33:02.447
Some of you are under 21.

33:02.689 --> 33:04.691
Some of us aren't,
so if you want to grab

33:04.816 --> 33:06.864
a cold one with me,
I'd be happy to.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.112
I will not "grab
a cold one" with you.

33:09.529 --> 33:10.576
You get high?

33:10.697 --> 33:11.789
I don't get high.

33:12.032 --> 33:14.535
I'm not judging.
Just saying. People do it.

33:14.951 --> 33:17.625
If you want something
cold to drink, we'll hook you up.

33:17.871 --> 33:20.215
Okay. Thank you.
Just stop talking to me.

33:20.457 --> 33:22.801
I'm your Bill Holden
in "Stalag 17".

33:23.126 --> 33:24.969
I really don't
get that reference.

33:25.212 --> 33:26.805
Google it.
Got it.

33:28.131 --> 33:29.974
"Dating a fellow intern."

33:31.635 --> 33:34.980
This is Google,
not Match.com.

33:35.222 --> 33:37.224
What about
a full-time employee?

33:37.474 --> 33:40.819
Say, management level
but not a direct supervisor.

33:41.144 --> 33:42.737
Great eyes, and a...

33:42.979 --> 33:47.325
...severity to her look
that is surprisingly sexy.

33:47.651 --> 33:49.324
What's the policy on that?

33:49.653 --> 33:51.155
That's frowned upon also?

33:51.404 --> 33:52.405
So we say no to love?

33:52.489 --> 33:53.581
Say no to love.

33:53.657 --> 33:54.749
That's a no.

33:55.825 --> 33:58.499
"Taking food home
from the office."

33:58.745 --> 34:00.247
Boom. That's a yes.

34:00.497 --> 34:03.000
Are you having difficulty
with this, Mr. McMahon?

34:03.250 --> 34:05.344
Just to drill down on this,
what if it's a

34:05.502 --> 34:07.596
perishable? Like
pudding that was left out?

34:07.837 --> 34:09.339
You'd like to
take home pudding?

34:09.589 --> 34:11.091
I wouldn't mind it.

34:11.341 --> 34:12.342
Oh, yeah.

34:12.509 --> 34:15.012
If it's going to go bad,
is it okay to take it home?

34:15.262 --> 34:16.764
Mmm-hmm. Anything else
you'd like to take home?

34:17.013 --> 34:19.357
Well, salsa or chips.
Something not wrapped.

34:19.599 --> 34:20.690
Salsa, chips and pudding.

34:20.934 --> 34:21.935
Sushi.

34:22.018 --> 34:23.257
Salsa, chips,
pudding and sushi.

34:23.270 --> 34:24.612
Anything else?
Ice cream.

34:24.853 --> 34:26.400
Salsa, chips, pudding,
sushi and ice cream.

34:26.481 --> 34:27.482
Pizza?

34:27.565 --> 34:29.525
Salsa, chips, pudding, sushi,
ice cream and pizza.

34:30.025 --> 34:33.371
Not a frozen pizza. But if
there was a nice pie out...?

34:33.697 --> 34:37.371
I am truly impressed,
Mr. McMahon.

34:37.659 --> 34:38.659
Thank you.

34:38.784 --> 34:39.831
At the both of you.

34:40.161 --> 34:42.835
At how quickly you have
confirmed my doubts about you.

34:43.706 --> 34:47.712
Now, let's try
this one more time.

34:48.210 --> 34:51.715
"Taking food
home... from the office."

34:54.050 --> 34:55.393
Very good.

34:59.556 --> 35:01.729
Ladies and gentlemen,
that is all!

35:11.067 --> 35:13.911
I'm not going to dress it
up... today didn't go well.

35:15.739 --> 35:19.039
It certainly wasn't the
first impression we wanted.

35:21.578 --> 35:23.080
But here's the deal.

35:23.705 --> 35:26.379
Tomorrow is
the pick teams day, right?

35:26.750 --> 35:30.425
It's important for us to
fall in with a strong team.

35:30.754 --> 35:32.506
If we can surround
ourselves with the right

35:32.589 --> 35:35.433
group of geniuses,
we still got a shot here.

35:35.925 --> 35:37.097
Nicky...

35:38.261 --> 35:39.934
...we can coattail this bitch.

35:40.221 --> 35:42.895
You're right! And there's
no shame in that.

35:43.141 --> 35:46.145
No shame in being the 12th man
at the end of the bench...

35:46.478 --> 35:49.482
...who never gets in the game
but has a lot of enthusiasm.

35:49.731 --> 35:52.985
He waves the towel, doles out
high fives during timeouts.

35:53.318 --> 35:55.491
Because I'll tell
you about that guy...

35:55.570 --> 35:58.323
when the team wins the championship,
he still gets a ring.

35:58.823 --> 35:59.915
Damn right he does.

36:00.158 --> 36:03.332
So we have to be that awkward
seven-footer from Lithuania.

36:03.662 --> 36:06.336
I love your spirit. And I
love you like a brother...

36:06.581 --> 36:09.755
...but I can't have those cold clams
brushing up against me in bed.

36:10.001 --> 36:11.674
Keeping me up.
Suit yourself.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.513
I'll take the bed tomorrow.

36:13.755 --> 36:15.928
<i>Can you hit that light,
Pocahontas?</i>

36:17.092 --> 36:18.685
<i>Tomorrow's a new day.</i>

36:19.511 --> 36:21.855
<i>Welcome to day two!
I am Sid.</i>

36:22.097 --> 36:25.772
Eight-year Googler.
You guys are new Googlers.

36:26.017 --> 36:28.361
Thus, you are Nooglers!

36:29.771 --> 36:32.274
Now, this place is
all about community...

36:32.524 --> 36:35.949
...and collaboration, so you'll
be working in teams from now on.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.447
You have five minutes.
Pick your teams.

36:38.863 --> 36:40.035
You, on me.

36:40.281 --> 36:42.454
Oh! Be picky, okay.
Play hard to get.

36:42.701 --> 36:45.545
Don't be desperate, just be cool.
This is everything!

36:45.787 --> 36:47.130
Are you looking for someone?

36:47.372 --> 36:48.464
College, major, SAT score.

36:48.665 --> 36:50.338
Harvard,
computer science, 2390.

36:50.625 --> 36:51.592
Fine. On me, fatface.

36:51.668 --> 36:52.760
My name's Zach.

36:52.836 --> 36:54.179
You.
University of...

36:54.462 --> 36:55.509
No.

36:56.339 --> 36:58.842
Hello, Stanford!
You're coming with me.

36:59.175 --> 37:02.349
University of Phoenix online...
sort of the Harvard of the west.

37:02.637 --> 37:05.356
Why don't we all be a team?
Why don't we all be a team?

37:05.682 --> 37:07.184
Why don't we all be a team?

37:07.475 --> 37:09.523
Please don't touch me.
You're touching me!

37:09.811 --> 37:12.485
Blondie, you're with me on account
of your physical appearance.

37:12.689 --> 37:15.158
Does anyone want to
be on a team with me?

37:15.358 --> 37:18.703
Super fun! Really smart,
but also very fun.

37:18.987 --> 37:22.161
I was voted Most Likely to
Succeed in my chess club.

37:28.455 --> 37:32.335
Um... Mr. Chetty?
I don't have a group.

37:32.709 --> 37:34.552
You'll mentor the leftovers.

37:34.878 --> 37:38.178
Which it would seem includes
your two charity cases.

37:39.048 --> 37:40.550
Off you go.

37:45.346 --> 37:46.393
Yo, Billy and Nick!

37:47.056 --> 37:48.228
There they are!

37:48.516 --> 37:51.520
I'm Lyle, one of the team managers.
Pound me.

37:52.395 --> 37:55.239
Just putting the fist out without
words is all that's necessary.

37:55.565 --> 37:57.408
Come on, bro, fist me.

37:57.692 --> 37:59.694
That's definitely not right.

37:59.903 --> 38:02.406
You're a manager?
How old are you?

38:02.697 --> 38:06.543
I'm 23. But no worries,
fellas, I'm an old soul.

38:07.243 --> 38:10.087
Well, the thing about that
is, we don't have a team.

38:10.371 --> 38:13.215
We have two... me and Nick. We
don't have the rest of our team.

38:13.374 --> 38:14.466
We didn't...

38:14.542 --> 38:17.716
Correction. You didn't have a
team, but you got one now, son!

38:17.921 --> 38:22.017
'Cause I got a few outliers.
Buh-bam! Kerplash! Zzz-yah!

38:22.217 --> 38:24.891
We about to get it all good
up in this hood, right?

38:25.261 --> 38:28.060
"Outliers". I just dropped
a little G-well on you.

38:28.264 --> 38:30.266
'Cause Malcolm is my dawg.

38:30.558 --> 38:32.526
What you say? Malcolm
is my...

38:32.769 --> 38:34.362
"Outliers", "10,000 hours".

38:34.604 --> 38:38.609
But let's get a team meeting going, everyone!
Team meet time!

38:39.275 --> 38:40.447
Nick?

38:40.944 --> 38:42.946
What other options do we have?

38:47.283 --> 38:50.287
Okay! Let's get some meet and
greet going up in this heezy!

38:50.620 --> 38:53.794
I'm Lyle and it's pretty much Wysiwyg...
what you see is what you get.

38:54.040 --> 38:56.042
Been at the Goog
for four years.

38:56.292 --> 38:58.966
Working on seven projies
<i>en este momento.</i>

38:59.295 --> 39:01.297
Wow! Seven projects!

39:01.548 --> 39:04.552
They ask and I do's it. What can I say?
I'm a people pleaser.

39:04.801 --> 39:08.806
'Specially the ladies, my Mercedes!
It's all good in Lyle's hood.

39:09.305 --> 39:12.650
Is Lyle always going to be referring
to himself in the third person?

39:12.892 --> 39:15.236
If he is, I might want to
punch Lyle in the face.

39:15.478 --> 39:16.900
Okay, good note.

39:17.146 --> 39:20.491
- Lyle's still a little nervous.
- Lyle's a first-time manager.

39:20.733 --> 39:22.235
I'll stop that.

39:22.485 --> 39:25.489
Keep it to first and second person.
Who's next?

39:27.657 --> 39:29.330
My name is Yo-Yo Santos.

39:29.659 --> 39:31.502
Yo-Yo, high five.
- Whoa!

39:32.161 --> 39:33.834
Yo-Yo, easy.
I come in peace!

39:34.080 --> 39:36.583
Did you get beat up
a lot in school?

39:37.166 --> 39:38.839
I was homeschooled by my mom.

39:39.085 --> 39:41.087
Did you get beat up
a lot in homeschool?

39:41.337 --> 39:43.180
Discipline is an important
part of growth.

39:43.423 --> 39:44.766
But my mother was
a very nurturing person.

39:44.841 --> 39:48.436
She provided me selflessly
with the milk of her bosom...

39:48.678 --> 39:50.772
...until I was seven.

39:50.847 --> 39:53.691
So you're tying your shoe,
climbing trees...

39:53.933 --> 39:56.777
blowing up fireworks,
and then you got mouth on Mom.

39:57.020 --> 39:58.613
Breastfeeding
leads to higher I.Q.

39:59.272 --> 40:01.946
Actually, the science
isn't definitive on that.

40:02.191 --> 40:04.614
I was bottle-fed.
It never slowed me down.

40:04.861 --> 40:08.707
Vitamins are vitamins, whether
they come from a teat or a baba.

40:09.032 --> 40:10.033
Wrong.

40:10.700 --> 40:11.701
Sorry, what?

40:11.951 --> 40:14.670
The teat or baba thing,
it's wrong.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.293
I just Googled it.
You're wrong.

40:18.207 --> 40:19.379
Oh, yeah, I'm Stuart.

40:19.876 --> 40:23.221
You know, you can't trust
everything you read on...

40:23.546 --> 40:25.548
The Journal of
the American Medical

40:25.673 --> 40:27.641
Association?
Pretty trustworthy.

40:27.717 --> 40:29.936
It says breast milk
has more nutrients,

40:30.011 --> 40:32.389
which are more easily
digested and absorbed.

40:32.805 --> 40:34.978
Your confusion's understandable...
you were bottlefed.

40:35.224 --> 40:36.225
He's right.

40:36.476 --> 40:39.320
Whoa! Guys, where's all
this hostility coming from?

40:39.562 --> 40:41.405
Where do you think,
you big tree?

40:41.648 --> 40:45.494
Two-fifths of our team are two
old guys who don't know shit.

40:46.152 --> 40:49.998
Okay, I for one am very
happy to have two...

40:50.657 --> 40:53.001
...strapping, mature
gentlemen on the team.

40:53.076 --> 40:54.419
Thank you.

40:54.494 --> 40:56.542
Oh, I'm Neha Patel.
And, oh, my God,

40:56.621 --> 40:59.716
you guys would make
the best Luke and Han.

40:59.916 --> 41:01.759
Oh, "Star Wars" cosplay.
"Cosplay"?

41:02.001 --> 41:03.753
Costume play!
People dress up as

41:03.920 --> 41:05.672
their favorite movie character.

41:05.922 --> 41:10.348
I'd be slave girl Leia. Yeah. Metal bikini top.
Metal G-string panty.

41:10.760 --> 41:12.433
High-heeled leather boots.

41:12.679 --> 41:15.774
I'm chained at the neck. Not too
constricted, but just enough...

41:16.099 --> 41:17.942
...to make things interesting.

41:18.184 --> 41:19.527
Neck constriction's
interesting.

41:19.769 --> 41:22.693
A few of us get together
and whatever happens happens.

41:23.940 --> 41:27.285
Oh, but workwise, your skills
aren't really relevant here...

41:27.527 --> 41:29.780
...or in this millennium,
so stay out of

41:29.946 --> 41:32.199
our way... we'll do
this shit on our own.

41:32.615 --> 41:34.242
Well, I'm loving this friction.

41:34.367 --> 41:35.960
It's how you get
a fire started.

41:36.285 --> 41:39.289
I'm Nick, this is my pal, Billy,
and despite what you think...

41:39.580 --> 41:41.924
...we're just like you,
running down a dream.

41:42.125 --> 41:43.297
All right!

41:43.626 --> 41:45.299
Team Lyle!

41:45.962 --> 41:48.260
Okay, we'll workshop
that. It's in beta.

41:48.798 --> 41:51.677
Okey-doke! Our Translate
lecture is in 15 minutes.

41:53.428 --> 41:57.149
Translate is about giving
everyone access to every word...

41:57.432 --> 42:00.606
...ever written, no matter what
language it was written in.

42:00.810 --> 42:02.938
Because when
the entire world can see,

42:03.021 --> 42:05.820
read and find the rest of
the world's cool stuff...

42:06.315 --> 42:07.487
...good things happen.

42:07.650 --> 42:09.903
Lyle, you laying-in-the-weeds
son of a bitch.

42:09.986 --> 42:12.159
You're hot for teacher, my man.

42:13.156 --> 42:15.329
I took her dance
class once here,

42:15.491 --> 42:17.664
but she doesn't
even know I exist.

42:17.994 --> 42:20.167
Doesn't know you exist?

42:20.455 --> 42:23.629
You're communicating
with her right here.

42:23.833 --> 42:26.256
Oh, no, this is just
the company intranet.

42:26.377 --> 42:28.800
It has info on
every Google employee.

42:29.005 --> 42:32.009
Birthdays, trivia, meeting
calendars, everything.

42:33.509 --> 42:35.432
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

42:49.192 --> 42:50.819
Ah! Hey. Fancy
seeing you here!

42:51.027 --> 42:54.531
Is it? Or you calendar-stalked
me and knew where I'd be.

42:54.864 --> 42:56.384
Now, am I detecting
a bit of an accent?

42:56.532 --> 42:58.034
You are!

42:58.326 --> 43:00.169
Uh-huh. I have
a very good ear.

43:00.369 --> 43:02.329
English, right?
Hello, guvnor!

43:02.413 --> 43:04.586
Oliver Twist.
"More bread, please."

43:04.832 --> 43:06.175
Australian, actually.

43:06.584 --> 43:08.586
Really? Similar flags,
though.

43:08.920 --> 43:11.264
Kiwi. "Lord
of the Rings" country.

43:11.506 --> 43:14.680
The stain on this one's better,
but the white one's a goner.

43:15.259 --> 43:16.260
I eat very fast.

43:16.511 --> 43:17.558
Bangers and mash.

43:17.720 --> 43:18.767
That's also British.

43:19.013 --> 43:21.015
Vegemite sandwich then,
which you gobble

43:21.140 --> 43:23.188
down so you can get
back to the grind.

43:23.434 --> 43:25.607
It is impressive,
staying at work till

43:25.728 --> 43:27.947
midnight every day.
Also on the calendar.

43:28.189 --> 43:29.361
Look, Nick.

43:29.774 --> 43:32.118
I'm sure you're
very popular with the

43:32.235 --> 43:34.613
19-year-olds at
the University of Phoenix...

43:34.862 --> 43:38.036
...with the southern drawl
and the blond hair and...

43:38.282 --> 43:41.582
...this whole thing you got going
on, but I have to tell you

43:41.661 --> 43:42.958
this is never going to happen.

43:43.204 --> 43:44.877
"This". What?

43:46.040 --> 43:48.714
Oh, no, no, no! This is me
reaching out as an intern.

43:48.960 --> 43:52.430
They encouraged us to approach experienced
Googlers and pick their brains.

43:52.505 --> 43:56.009
Oh! Oh, I'm sorry!
Of course!

43:56.134 --> 43:59.138
You thought I was... "Oh, who's
this wanker steaming in?"

43:59.387 --> 44:01.731
You just want to learn!
Well, look.

44:01.973 --> 44:05.648
Sid here is incredible. He's
about to give a talk on HTML5.

44:05.977 --> 44:09.322
Nick is desperate to learn.
He'd love to come along.

44:09.564 --> 44:11.407
Sure. Come on down,
brother!

44:11.649 --> 44:13.322
Sometimes we go
all day, all night.

44:13.568 --> 44:16.321
Oh, I can't start any sooner
than right now. Let's do it.

44:16.571 --> 44:19.165
Come on, everybody!
Where are you going?

44:19.490 --> 44:23.495
Oh, I have a meeting.
But you know that. Cheerio!

44:24.162 --> 44:25.163
Cheerio.

44:25.496 --> 44:28.170
Let's go.
Come on. Don't be shy.

44:31.836 --> 44:34.635
You have a crush
on her, my friend!

44:35.089 --> 44:36.682
<i>Good morning,
interns. Today marks</i>

44:36.799 --> 44:38.426
<i>the first of
several challenges...</i>

44:38.676 --> 44:40.849
<i>...through which your team
shows its merits.</i>

44:41.095 --> 44:43.769
While dogfooding
a new product, Googlers...

44:44.015 --> 44:46.359
<i>...reported a bug that
disabled their audio.</i>

44:46.601 --> 44:50.447
<i>Two million lines of code
are in the source files.</i>

44:50.688 --> 44:52.690
Your job? Find the bug.

44:52.940 --> 44:54.533
Let's check the user reports.

44:54.692 --> 44:55.773
Check for red flags.

44:55.818 --> 44:57.058
See what
exceptions were thrown.

44:57.111 --> 44:59.785
I start by drawing up
strategies to sift through the code.

45:00.031 --> 45:01.624
Code, right?
Code, right?

45:01.866 --> 45:04.710
So we're looking to kind
of break the password.

45:04.952 --> 45:07.125
Is the answer in
the question? "Bug".

45:07.205 --> 45:08.457
Eureka!

45:08.539 --> 45:10.541
Bug like fly. "The Fly".
Is Chetty a cinephile?

45:10.791 --> 45:12.088
Goldblum!

45:12.168 --> 45:14.011
Mind-boggling no
one's notebook is out.

45:14.086 --> 45:15.087
This gibberish you're
writing may or may not be

45:15.171 --> 45:18.766
helpful. I guarantee what
we're saying is helpful!

45:19.133 --> 45:22.478
We're looking for a bug, not a password.
They're different things.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.438
Keep going with
that human connection.

45:25.723 --> 45:28.067
Go on, stay positive.
Go, go, go.

45:28.309 --> 45:30.482
We'll go on "fly".
'Cause we're "fly"-ing it.

45:30.728 --> 45:32.822
Fly. Fly. I like that.

45:33.648 --> 45:36.151
Y-L-F. It's a word
scramble, it's "life"!

45:36.400 --> 45:37.868
I can't get
"fly" out of my mind,

45:37.985 --> 45:39.407
and now I'm
going Jennifer Lopez.

45:39.654 --> 45:40.997
Is it a Fly Girl?
Superfly!

45:41.239 --> 45:43.241
Pop fly. Uh, excavation.

45:43.491 --> 45:44.583
Earthquakes! California!

45:44.825 --> 45:46.919
That's it! Write it down!
Do it, do it!

45:47.161 --> 45:48.583
Will you please stop?!

45:48.829 --> 45:51.082
No, we're working!

45:51.332 --> 45:53.676
Yeah, and that's
a Sharpie, genius.

45:55.169 --> 45:56.512
That's my fault.

45:57.338 --> 45:58.840
I'll go ahead and wash that.

45:59.507 --> 46:01.885
Guys, I'm sorry,
but you're not helping.

46:01.968 --> 46:04.517
You're saying a lot of words
really fast that mean nothing.

46:04.762 --> 46:07.686
To find the bug, we need to
review the code and find...

46:07.932 --> 46:09.934
...the programmer's mistake.
It's the only way.

46:10.184 --> 46:11.857
But what if it's
not the only way?

46:12.520 --> 46:14.568
You said someone programmed it.

46:14.689 --> 46:16.737
Someone in this building
wrote that code.

46:16.816 --> 46:18.033
A human being!

46:18.109 --> 46:19.861
Let's give him
a name... Tony.

46:20.444 --> 46:22.196
Let's say Tony likes kayaking.

46:22.863 --> 46:25.537
Me and Nick become
friends with Tony.

46:25.783 --> 46:28.457
We throw some beers back,
do some kayaking.

46:28.786 --> 46:30.459
Tony's bombed on
the open water.

46:30.705 --> 46:33.379
Next thing you know, we're
gabbing about audio bugs!

46:33.708 --> 46:35.301
I think it's a great idea.

46:35.543 --> 46:36.715
Great!
Finally!

46:36.961 --> 46:38.304
Dark and Stormy feeling us!

46:38.546 --> 46:39.968
Feeling you big time, buddy.

46:40.214 --> 46:43.559
In fact, why don't the two of
you go and find the programmer?

46:43.884 --> 46:45.227
Great. Great idea.

46:45.428 --> 46:46.554
Yo-Yo, who's our man?

46:47.430 --> 46:49.558
His name is Charles Xavier.

46:50.558 --> 46:52.438
Perfect. Nick, write it down.
Steel trap.

46:52.560 --> 46:55.234
Uh... He's a professor.
At Stanford.

46:55.438 --> 46:57.236
Just a few
minutes away, really.

46:57.315 --> 46:58.316
Guys.

46:58.399 --> 46:59.446
He's in a wheelchair.

46:59.734 --> 47:01.202
Stanford.
Wheelchair. What else?

47:01.277 --> 47:02.369
Oh, he's bald!

47:02.445 --> 47:04.565
May be with his best friend,
who wears a metal helmet.

47:04.739 --> 47:06.499
He's a genetics professor.

47:06.741 --> 47:07.913
More, more! Hit us!

47:08.117 --> 47:09.960
He has a British accent. British!
With my ear, we're done.

47:10.202 --> 47:13.251
Keep searching.
Think fly, think bug.

47:13.331 --> 47:14.833
I promise you this somehow
intersects with Goldblum.

47:14.915 --> 47:16.087
Goldblum. Of course.

47:16.208 --> 47:17.425
Back to work, guys.

47:21.422 --> 47:22.942
Hey, Professor, what up?

47:27.094 --> 47:28.596
Professor Charles Xavier?

47:28.804 --> 47:29.976
Very funny.

47:30.222 --> 47:33.271
British! Professor Xavier,
sorry to bother you. If you...

47:33.476 --> 47:35.478
Gentlemen, I don't
have time for this.

47:35.770 --> 47:39.274
Professor Xavier, we know it's you.
We really need your help.

47:39.482 --> 47:42.326
All right, you found me out.
I am Charles Xavier.

47:43.944 --> 47:47.619
And that's Cyclops,
and Rogue. We're all here.

47:48.282 --> 47:52.628
Come closer. I want to share some
of my telekinetic wisdom with you.

47:52.953 --> 47:55.456
Good, 'cause I want to
know about these bugs.

47:58.626 --> 47:59.627
Assholes!

47:59.835 --> 48:01.963
You maniacal monster!

48:02.296 --> 48:04.640
Professor Xavier
is a total dick!

48:06.008 --> 48:08.682
Yo to the Yo, have we ensured
it wasn't a networking issue?

48:08.844 --> 48:10.471
Confirmed there
was no packet loss.

48:10.554 --> 48:12.682
Almost done checking
the encryption.

48:12.973 --> 48:16.477
"Almost"? Either you're done or not.
You can't be almost pregnant.

48:16.685 --> 48:18.187
And she would know, guys.

48:18.479 --> 48:20.197
Go Google "asshole", asshole.

48:20.481 --> 48:23.655
She's right. It's not good enough, Yo-Yo.
Get it together.

48:24.193 --> 48:25.445
What the fuck was that?

48:25.528 --> 48:27.576
I'm punishing myself for
my inferior performance.

48:27.655 --> 48:30.909
Wow. Good. Great.
That one's crazy.

48:30.991 --> 48:32.163
And crazy horny over here.

48:32.243 --> 48:34.962
Let me guess. Big dick,
'cause little dick?

48:35.162 --> 48:37.836
Does your mind just immediately
go to a penis joke?

48:38.124 --> 48:40.502
Was that not witty enough?
I'm just busy working.

48:40.793 --> 48:43.922
That's fine, but I'm
winning the quip-off.

48:44.046 --> 48:45.423
- That's what you're worried about?
- Yes.

48:45.506 --> 48:48.350
You're more concerned with
snarky banter than working?

48:55.057 --> 48:57.776
Hey! Did you guys
find Professor Xavier?

48:58.018 --> 48:59.019
Yeah, we found him.

48:59.270 --> 49:02.945
Yeah, thanks so much for that.
Really great team spirit.

49:03.190 --> 49:04.533
Mind sliding over?

49:06.610 --> 49:09.614
I'm sorry, it doesn't look like
there's enough room for you.

49:12.783 --> 49:14.535
Have a great lunch.
Yeah, enjoy it.

49:16.245 --> 49:17.747
Okay, let's see.

49:20.291 --> 49:21.634
Let's see.

49:21.959 --> 49:23.802
- See anything?
- Oh! There's an opening.

49:24.044 --> 49:25.796
- Is that taken?
- It's taken.

49:30.301 --> 49:31.974
Let's go over there.

49:34.805 --> 49:37.228
Hi, Headphones.
Mind if we sit here?

49:38.017 --> 49:40.145
We can take that as a yes.

49:41.145 --> 49:42.818
We have to at this point.

49:43.063 --> 49:44.656
How you doing, bud?

49:44.899 --> 49:48.654
He doesn't even know we exist. He's
like a superhero on this computer.

49:48.903 --> 49:51.907
Look at him, just crushing
his thing and kicking ass.

49:52.323 --> 49:55.167
Do you remember what it felt like
to be that good at something?

49:56.327 --> 49:58.830
Look at this! William.

49:59.246 --> 50:00.247
Nicholas.

50:00.498 --> 50:02.500
Person I don't know.

50:02.917 --> 50:04.677
Thought I'd find you
at the cool kids' table.

50:04.835 --> 50:07.679
It's like a confederacy
of outcasts out here.

50:08.172 --> 50:10.846
Heard you had a day
trip to Palo Alto.

50:11.175 --> 50:14.679
Home of Silicon Valley and
also the X-Men, apparently.

50:15.012 --> 50:16.434
Where are you going with this?

50:16.680 --> 50:20.685
Oh, I just wanted to let you guys
know we won the bug challenge!

50:20.935 --> 50:22.357
What are you
going to do about it?

50:22.603 --> 50:25.777
Don't worry about what we'll do or not do.
We'll be just fine.

50:26.023 --> 50:28.697
You'll be fine?
Keep telling yourself that.

50:29.026 --> 50:30.448
See you on the intramural field

50:30.611 --> 50:32.033
for the next
challenge I'll win.

50:32.279 --> 50:33.952
Sports! Something
we know about, baby.

50:34.073 --> 50:35.700
Something we know a lot about.

50:36.033 --> 50:37.376
Come on now!
Look at me.

50:38.202 --> 50:39.249
For real.

51:01.934 --> 51:04.312
All right, teams, welcome
to the Quidditch pitch.

51:04.603 --> 51:06.804
Let's have a good clean match, Nooglers.

51:13.779 --> 51:15.122
Fatty, don't touch the ball.

51:15.322 --> 51:17.416
Rules: The Beaters
toss the Bludgers at the

51:17.491 --> 51:18.993
Chasers then get the
Quaff le through the ring.

51:19.285 --> 51:20.878
No blagging,
blatching, bumphing,

51:20.995 --> 51:22.622
haversacking or
Quaff le-pocking.

51:22.830 --> 51:25.003
No Imperius Curses
or Confundus Charms.

51:25.291 --> 51:28.636
In the unlikely event of a Dementor
attack, use a Patronus Charm.

51:28.836 --> 51:30.964
I recommend
the stag personally.

51:31.171 --> 51:33.139
Lyle, they have
no idea what you're

51:33.257 --> 51:35.180
talking about.
Use your Muggle words.

51:35.467 --> 51:38.141
You're making me feel like
I'm back in math class.

51:38.345 --> 51:41.315
You have a couple savants here
with eye-hand coordination.

51:41.390 --> 51:43.017
Say "game on" and let us play!

51:43.642 --> 51:45.986
Version 2.0: Peg them
with kickballs before

51:46.103 --> 51:48.481
they throw the volleyball
through the hoop.

51:48.689 --> 51:50.862
Brooms in, people.
Hufflepuff on three.

51:51.150 --> 51:52.823
One, two, three...

51:52.901 --> 51:54.073
Hufflepuff!

51:54.194 --> 51:56.196
Yeah, son! Let's get it!

51:56.488 --> 51:57.831
Game time.

51:58.157 --> 52:00.077
Let's get started in here!

52:05.372 --> 52:06.715
No mercy!

52:06.999 --> 52:08.501
No mercy!

52:09.543 --> 52:11.045
Tips down!

52:11.211 --> 52:12.383
Blue team ready?

52:14.381 --> 52:16.054
Red team ready?

52:16.342 --> 52:17.559
Bangarang!

52:17.676 --> 52:19.019
Brooms up!

52:31.899 --> 52:33.196
Ball!

52:37.112 --> 52:38.238
Yeah!

52:38.530 --> 52:40.203
Ten points, blue!

52:40.449 --> 52:42.209
- Billy, talk to me!
- What do I do?

52:42.368 --> 52:43.620
What are we doing?
It's chaos!

52:43.744 --> 52:45.087
How do I do it?

52:48.540 --> 52:49.712
I'm lost!

52:49.958 --> 52:51.301
Hit up, hit up!

52:51.543 --> 52:53.671
Whoa, whoa, what's happening?!

52:56.840 --> 52:57.841
What the hell was that?

52:58.092 --> 52:59.844
Try looking up
and giving a shit!

52:59.968 --> 53:02.016
Come on!

53:02.096 --> 53:05.441
What am I supposed to... Come get
some of this! Who do I hit?

53:05.766 --> 53:08.440
I want somebody to hit!

53:08.686 --> 53:10.029
Broom between the legs!

53:10.270 --> 53:11.943
My bad. Lesson learned.

53:12.189 --> 53:14.612
What the fuck does this
have to do with computers?

53:15.567 --> 53:17.285
Stop.
Don't move, fatty!

53:25.119 --> 53:26.211
Blue, ten points!

53:26.453 --> 53:27.454
Ball!

53:28.914 --> 53:30.086
Thank you.

53:33.168 --> 53:34.215
Time out!

53:34.294 --> 53:35.261
Time.

53:38.424 --> 53:39.767
Bring it in, guys!

53:40.008 --> 53:42.352
Good work, everybody.
Except you, Zach.

53:42.594 --> 53:44.267
It's over.
Our team's a joke.

53:44.513 --> 53:46.561
Well, I ain't laughing.
Are you, Billy?

53:46.640 --> 53:47.687
Hell, no.

53:47.933 --> 53:51.278
We need to get our minds
right and start believing.

53:51.520 --> 53:54.364
This reminds me of a girl
who had to start believing.

53:54.440 --> 53:55.862
A girl from a steel town
who had the dream...

53:56.108 --> 53:57.200
...to dance.

53:57.443 --> 54:00.617
No one believed in the welder girl,
but she believed in herself.

54:00.863 --> 54:02.957
Are you talking
about "Flashdance"?

54:03.198 --> 54:05.200
You're damn right I am!

54:05.451 --> 54:08.625
The deck was stacked against Alex.
You know how she overcame it?

54:08.871 --> 54:10.999
By believing in
herself and trying.

54:11.123 --> 54:13.217
She literally had
to become a maniac!

54:13.459 --> 54:16.963
Have any of you been called a
maniac because you were different?

54:17.212 --> 54:19.886
My morn calls me a maniac
when I tell her I love her.

54:20.132 --> 54:23.136
Of course she does! You are a little bit...
in a good way!

54:23.552 --> 54:26.556
Well, guess what? They called
Bill Gates a maniac, too.

54:26.638 --> 54:27.890
No question.

54:27.973 --> 54:30.226
I don't think anyone
called him a maniac.

54:30.517 --> 54:31.860
I just did!

54:31.977 --> 54:33.354
You guys are
getting off the point!

54:33.562 --> 54:35.030
She had to strip
down to nothing!

54:35.230 --> 54:37.483
She had to sit in a chair,
pull that chain

54:37.566 --> 54:38.909
to nowhere back and douse
herself with water!

54:39.193 --> 54:41.036
Where did that water come from?
Who knows?!

54:41.236 --> 54:43.580
It came from her
belief it was there!

54:43.864 --> 54:47.539
She believed so hard, she got an
audition at the dance school...

54:47.868 --> 54:50.872
...and she spun. Oh, she spun.

54:51.205 --> 54:52.878
And she spun and she spun...

54:53.081 --> 54:57.052
...and she spun herself into that dance school!
And into our hearts.

54:58.212 --> 55:02.217
Now, in the second half of whatever
the hell you call this game...

55:02.549 --> 55:04.222
...can't we all be
that welder girl

55:04.343 --> 55:06.061
who wants to be something more?

55:06.720 --> 55:09.769
I know you're not excited we're on your team.
But we're here.

55:10.390 --> 55:12.063
We're in this thing together.

55:12.267 --> 55:15.237
So I'm asking you, believe in yourselves.
Believe in each other.

55:16.438 --> 55:18.111
Let's put on our leg warmers...

55:18.398 --> 55:19.900
...and dance our asses off.

55:20.108 --> 55:22.782
Come here, you little lovable maniacs.
Get in here.

55:23.070 --> 55:26.074
I have an idea that I think
would make Bear Bryant smile.

55:26.281 --> 55:28.321
I don't know who that
is, but we're listening.

55:32.913 --> 55:34.085
Let's go!

55:36.583 --> 55:37.584
Stuart!

55:38.585 --> 55:39.757
Neha!

55:41.088 --> 55:43.341
Lyle, hit me! I got it!

55:46.176 --> 55:47.473
Baby!

55:55.102 --> 55:57.104
Blind her!
I'm going in!

55:59.815 --> 56:01.488
Yes!

56:09.283 --> 56:10.455
Yo-Yo!

56:12.953 --> 56:14.626
Eat it, Malfoy!

56:19.626 --> 56:20.627
See you!

56:20.711 --> 56:22.008
Coming at you, Nick!

56:24.548 --> 56:26.425
Who's on blondie?

56:27.217 --> 56:29.060
Let's go, boys!

56:33.181 --> 56:34.398
Pick and roll!

56:35.142 --> 56:37.895
Stockton and Malone.
She shoots and scores!

56:38.145 --> 56:39.818
Billy, what's up!

56:41.148 --> 56:42.149
Tie game!

56:42.482 --> 56:43.699
Where were you, huh?!

56:43.817 --> 56:45.069
I had to use the restroom.

56:50.032 --> 56:51.375
It's the Golden Snitch!

56:51.658 --> 56:53.831
Who the fuck is this now?

56:54.161 --> 56:55.504
Zach, get over here.

56:56.330 --> 56:58.503
Fatface, it's time
to fake an injury.

56:58.707 --> 56:59.833
I don't know how.

57:01.335 --> 57:02.552
Man down!

57:04.880 --> 57:07.053
Get the tennis ball and we win!

57:14.890 --> 57:16.392
Run, you big tree!

57:17.017 --> 57:18.769
Go!

57:18.852 --> 57:21.526
Come on, ref!
Are you going to call that?

57:34.493 --> 57:35.790
Yeah! Yeah!

57:46.046 --> 57:48.720
That bitch just snaked me!
That must be illegal!

57:49.049 --> 57:51.097
Sorry. If I didn't
see it, I can't call it.

57:51.551 --> 57:53.224
You okay, Golden Boy?

57:53.387 --> 57:54.388
The Snitch is fine.

57:54.596 --> 57:55.939
G.D. it!

57:56.223 --> 57:58.442
Don't start that, Yo-Yo.
You did...

57:58.725 --> 58:00.648
...your best out there.
That's the first time

58:00.769 --> 58:02.737
we all came together as a team.

58:03.063 --> 58:04.736
Billy's right.

58:05.107 --> 58:07.951
Let's keep it rolling.
Just keep it rolling.

58:08.235 --> 58:09.908
Come on, let's get a frosty.

58:10.237 --> 58:11.409
Nick?

58:14.241 --> 58:16.084
Would I be wrong to
call you my brother?

58:16.284 --> 58:19.959
Of course not. I'd do anything for
my little show pony. Anything.

58:20.455 --> 58:22.082
I need you to ice
my balls for me.

58:25.919 --> 58:27.136
Brother!

58:33.343 --> 58:35.516
Oh, boy.

58:35.804 --> 58:38.307
Time to shut the engines
down for a bit.

58:39.099 --> 58:43.445
Take a load off, Nicky. What
would I do without these babies?

58:43.770 --> 58:45.613
This is a "shh" zone.

58:45.939 --> 58:47.441
Oh, hi! Hey.

58:47.774 --> 58:49.117
Sorry.

58:49.609 --> 58:51.282
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

58:52.112 --> 58:55.616
Thanks for sending me to that seminar.
It was actually interesting.

58:56.116 --> 58:57.959
- Really?
- Absolutely.

58:58.952 --> 59:00.352
What have you been up to?

59:00.495 --> 59:01.587
I'm going to go.

59:01.705 --> 59:02.797
No, no, wait!

59:03.165 --> 59:05.839
You were here first.
I'll leave. Sorry.

59:06.126 --> 59:07.799
One thing... quick question.

59:08.003 --> 59:09.971
If I was to invite
someone out to a really

59:10.088 --> 59:12.011
nice dinner around here,
where would I go?

59:12.340 --> 59:13.842
Urn...

59:14.301 --> 59:17.805
I wouldn't know. I spend
most of my time on campus.

59:18.013 --> 59:20.141
What? That's criminal!

59:20.348 --> 59:22.521
Has it occurred to you I
work hard for a reason, hmm?

59:23.643 --> 59:26.647
This may sound silly to you, but
I believe what we do here...

59:26.855 --> 59:28.357
...makes people's
lives better.

59:28.648 --> 59:31.492
That doesn't sound silly.
I think it's admirable.

59:31.693 --> 59:34.822
I'm just saying that sometimes
with all the work you can...

59:35.197 --> 59:37.495
...forget about the person
who matters most.

59:38.158 --> 59:42.208
Is this a nap pod or a convo pod?
Oh, that's right, it's a nap pod.

59:42.287 --> 59:44.164
Shh!
Yikes.

59:44.831 --> 59:47.209
- I know where you're going with this.
- You think...

59:47.501 --> 59:50.550
I'm some 30-year-old exec who
devoted her life to her career.

59:50.837 --> 59:55.217
And one day I'll wake up wanting more.
Stop me if I'm off base here.

59:56.843 --> 59:59.687
What else? That I can't
go on Facebook anymore...

59:59.888 --> 01:00:01.890
because it's only happy
couples gloating over

01:00:01.973 --> 01:00:04.692
perfect babies in socks
that look like sneakers?

01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:06.895
Oh, yeah,
the little Chuck Taylors.

01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:09.189
Only I'm ten years too late.
While I've been

01:00:09.356 --> 01:00:11.404
working, I missed
out on the bad dates...

01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:14.035
...and assholes and now
I'm running out of time.

01:00:15.195 --> 01:00:17.493
No one told me it was a
game of musical chairs.

01:00:17.572 --> 01:00:20.200
By the time I figured
it out, it was too late.

01:00:20.408 --> 01:00:21.830
Yeah.

01:00:23.036 --> 01:00:24.208
Anyway...

01:00:25.705 --> 01:00:29.050
Anyway, is that what
you were going to say to me?

01:00:29.376 --> 01:00:31.424
No. I was going to suggest
you work harder.

01:00:31.711 --> 01:00:34.385
That you buckle down
and get to work.

01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:38.935
You can't change the world while
laying in a nap pod. But honestly...

01:00:39.219 --> 01:00:43.065
...if any of what you just said
applies even slightly to yourself...

01:00:43.265 --> 01:00:45.939
...you might think about
doing something about it.

01:00:46.226 --> 01:00:47.899
That's coming from someone...

01:00:48.103 --> 01:00:51.778
...who wakes up in the morning, and first
thing on their calendar is regret.

01:00:52.065 --> 01:00:53.908
And that's not a good feeling.

01:00:57.279 --> 01:00:58.781
Anyway, I should go.

01:00:59.072 --> 01:01:00.073
Thank you!

01:01:00.907 --> 01:01:02.580
- But before I do...
- Oh, jeez!

01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:06.413
Just bear with me. I want to throw
down a challenge for you...

01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:08.623
...to go out to dinner
before I leave town.

01:01:08.915 --> 01:01:10.963
I'll tell you if
a window opens up.

01:01:11.251 --> 01:01:13.253
Great. And if it does,
don't minimize it.

01:01:13.378 --> 01:01:15.426
Don't click
the red X in the corner.

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:17.303
See? I'm getting it.

01:01:17.757 --> 01:01:19.100
I get it.

01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:22.929
Shh, go back to sleep.

01:01:29.603 --> 01:01:30.775
Hey, Chetty!

01:01:31.771 --> 01:01:34.445
Pretty good effort
on the Quidditch field, huh?

01:01:34.774 --> 01:01:38.119
It was a game throwing
balls. And you lost.

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:42.116
But we really rallied in the second half.
Kind of a spiritual victory.

01:01:42.282 --> 01:01:44.705
Perhaps you'll
land a spiritual job.

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:47.541
You know,
the admissions committee

01:01:47.662 --> 01:01:49.881
was split on you.
You made it by one vote.

01:01:50.123 --> 01:01:52.626
The deciding member thought
you showed promise.

01:01:52.959 --> 01:01:56.133
It's clear now
that he was wrong.

01:01:56.463 --> 01:01:59.467
Sometimes the long shots
pay off the biggest.

01:02:01.468 --> 01:02:02.640
Enjoy your pudding.

01:02:02.761 --> 01:02:03.978
I will.

01:02:04.804 --> 01:02:06.147
Oh! And Chetty?

01:02:06.806 --> 01:02:10.060
Not for nothing... you can't
get me not to like you.

01:02:17.984 --> 01:02:20.032
Let's take this new
team spirit and apply it

01:02:20.153 --> 01:02:22.247
to this next app challenge.
We got this.

01:02:22.489 --> 01:02:24.332
It'd help
if we had an idea for one.

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:27.418
You bet your sweet
ass it would, Stewie.

01:02:27.744 --> 01:02:28.916
No. Never Stewie.

01:02:29.162 --> 01:02:31.836
Perimeter breach
acknowledged, Stuart.

01:02:32.082 --> 01:02:34.255
It'll feel good
when he warms up to me.

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:35.927
It's going to happen.

01:02:36.169 --> 01:02:39.173
I'll break you down like a
two-by-four, bronco. Watch me.

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:41.265
Let's brainstorm this puppy.

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:43.844
Put the coffee in the pot
and let it percolate!

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:46.438
Let's explore what apps
have been most popular.

01:02:46.638 --> 01:02:47.759
Go backwards to go forwards!

01:02:47.847 --> 01:02:51.021
Oh, and we can bin it. Categorize
needle-movers by user.

01:02:51.101 --> 01:02:52.353
Do what?

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:54.779
Hit it by function
and user. Two-prong.

01:02:55.021 --> 01:02:56.523
Taking out the shield
generator on the forest moon

01:02:56.606 --> 01:02:58.779
of Endor and fighting
with Admiral Ackbar.

01:02:59.025 --> 01:03:00.368
It's not a trap!

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:03.284
Guys, I don't want to kill
the momentum or the mojo...

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:06.958
...but needles and categories,
they don't use apps.

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:08.661
People use apps.

01:03:08.868 --> 01:03:11.371
So I have an idea.
People take pictures, right?

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:12.626
They have their phones out,
they see something,

01:03:12.706 --> 01:03:16.427
take it, but then the photo's
just sitting there.

01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:18.219
What if they take that
photo and instantaneously

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:21.390
put it out on the line and
share it with friends?

01:03:21.464 --> 01:03:23.808
That's Instagram.
It already exists.

01:03:23.883 --> 01:03:25.601
It's one of the most popular
apps in the world.

01:03:25.677 --> 01:03:28.556
Facebook bought it
for a billion dollars.

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:30.148
Oh, no, no,
mine's very different.

01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:32.233
How is yours "very different"?

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:34.773
In mine, you put
the photo out on the line.

01:03:34.853 --> 01:03:36.070
"Online".

01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:37.819
A photo exchange on the line.

01:03:38.064 --> 01:03:39.065
That's Instagram.

01:03:39.316 --> 01:03:41.410
Mine has social sharing on the line.
Online.

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:44.746
When you keep saying "on the
line", do you mean "online"?

01:03:44.988 --> 01:03:48.913
Stuart, don't do that! He's got
a million dollar idea there!

01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:50.411
Billion dollar idea.

01:03:50.535 --> 01:03:51.752
Even better! Let him flow.

01:03:51.911 --> 01:03:53.254
You can't bring me down,
I'm too positive.

01:03:53.413 --> 01:03:56.166
Let me share something with you.
Nah.

01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:58.752
Come. I'll explain in
a way that's visual.

01:03:59.002 --> 01:04:00.282
He's bigger than you.
Be careful.

01:04:00.337 --> 01:04:01.714
So you're out there,
you take a photo.

01:04:01.796 --> 01:04:03.719
Pretend. Go ahead.

01:04:05.925 --> 01:04:08.019
So you take that photo,
put it on the line...

01:04:08.094 --> 01:04:09.095
Online.

01:04:09.179 --> 01:04:12.023
Put it on Twitter, whatever you want.
That's Instagram.

01:04:12.265 --> 01:04:13.687
That is Instagram.
100%.

01:04:13.933 --> 01:04:14.934
I get it.

01:04:15.018 --> 01:04:16.110
We're not dummies!

01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:18.860
Point taken. Now
let's go with my concept.

01:04:19.189 --> 01:04:22.489
You've taken
a photo instantaneously

01:04:22.567 --> 01:04:24.194
or not instantaneously
and then...

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:27.451
...you take those and send
those out on the line.

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:28.698
Online.

01:04:28.948 --> 01:04:32.122
You don't have to say shit!
You just say...

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:35.464
... "I like that photo"  and share
that photo on the line...

01:04:35.705 --> 01:04:36.797
Online.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:39.884
Now everyone's
exchanging photos!

01:04:40.126 --> 01:04:43.721
And that's why the photos being
shared on the line will be known...

01:04:44.047 --> 01:04:45.720
...as Exchangeagram!

01:04:45.965 --> 01:04:48.468
Holy shitballs, Billy, we
don't have time for this!

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:51.562
Hello, fellow interns!
Graham Hawtrey here.

01:04:51.805 --> 01:04:54.228
I've attached
a link to our app...

01:04:54.474 --> 01:04:57.148
...which has already been
downloaded 230 times. Booyah!

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:01.197
We're going to lose
another challenge.

01:05:01.272 --> 01:05:03.570
We won't get these jobs. Our
lives are basically ruined.

01:05:03.817 --> 01:05:05.990
Hold on.
Your life isn't ruined.

01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:09.414
You guys are 21. You have your
whole life in front of you.

01:05:09.656 --> 01:05:11.408
Do you know what
it's like to be 21 now?

01:05:11.825 --> 01:05:14.499
A quarter of the kids coming
out of college can't get jobs.

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:17.588
That's correct. Mother says
you can work hard and...

01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:18.753
...go to the right school
but nothing is

01:05:18.832 --> 01:05:21.676
guaranteed anymore.
That's life.

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:23.261
These guys are right.

01:05:23.503 --> 01:05:25.597
The whole American Dream
thing you guys

01:05:25.672 --> 01:05:28.516
grew up on, that's
all it is now... a dream.

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:30.510
You're too young
to be this cynical!

01:05:30.677 --> 01:05:32.429
You really see
the world this way?

01:05:32.679 --> 01:05:36.354
That's not how we see it. It's
just the way things are now.

01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:39.853
That's it. Everybody up.

01:05:40.186 --> 01:05:41.859
Breath-of-fresh-air time.

01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:43.448
We have work to do.

01:05:43.523 --> 01:05:45.116
No, no, no, no, no. Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.

01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:49.037
We're taking it to the street.
We'll get our heads right...

01:05:49.279 --> 01:05:50.622
...so we can work
as a team.

01:05:50.864 --> 01:05:52.366
What about the app?
This is bigger than an app.

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:54.959
And we have
something pretty terrific

01:05:55.034 --> 01:05:56.627
in our back pocket
with Exchangeagram.

01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:58.622
Just let it marinate.

01:05:58.913 --> 01:06:00.256
Yeah, that's a winner.

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:03.293
Time to light it up
forever and never go to sleep.

01:06:04.294 --> 01:06:06.968
Can we talk about this
online/on the line thing?

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:08.610
We're gonna follow the morons.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.404
<i>...and she says "Wait a
minute, that's not a duck!"</i>

01:06:36.576 --> 01:06:39.697
My friend here says there's a
dance club down the street that's great.

01:06:39.871 --> 01:06:42.715
You're shitting me.
Come on, let's hit it!

01:07:18.743 --> 01:07:20.791
Are you sure
he said "dance club"?

01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:23.794
I was rocking Mandarin,
he was rocking Cantonese.

01:07:23.957 --> 01:07:29.214
Something clearly got confused.
But I say, happy accident.

01:07:31.297 --> 01:07:33.015
Show you to your table?

01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:39.397
Great big world
out there, my friend,

01:07:39.472 --> 01:07:41.600
just three inches up,
I beg you.

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:45.190
Any questions?

01:07:46.646 --> 01:07:48.114
Oh! Ooh!

01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:51.485
Holy shit, that's deep.

01:07:54.487 --> 01:07:56.660
I think that's
our cue. Here we go.

01:07:57.991 --> 01:07:59.664
Come on!

01:07:59.951 --> 01:08:02.545
This is good. It's totally cool.
It's great. Ahem!

01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:04.167
You okay, firecracker?

01:08:04.539 --> 01:08:07.634
What? Yeah! Totally!
This is my jam.

01:08:08.042 --> 01:08:09.715
This here is my shit.

01:08:10.003 --> 01:08:12.256
I know, but if you
don't want to be here,

01:08:12.338 --> 01:08:15.683
we'll grab the guys by their little
boners and go back on the bus.

01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:19.013
No, no, don't do that.
Don't. It's just...

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:22.189
...I've only read
about this stuff, okay?

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:26.357
Craigslist casual encounters.
"Twilight" fan fiction. Hentai.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.562
What's Hentai?

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:30.939
Japanese comic books where
women get penetrated

01:08:31.024 --> 01:08:32.196
by octopus tentacles.

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:34.532
Oh! Ah!

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:36.287
Look, it's just...

01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:39.287
...I have imagined everything.
It's just...

01:08:39.616 --> 01:08:41.538
...I've never done anything.

01:08:41.618 --> 01:08:43.620
Your secret's safe with us.

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:48.129
And for what it's worth,
your imagination is so wild...

01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:51.218
...reality will be a breeze,
if not a letdown.

01:08:52.502 --> 01:08:55.051
Thanks. Show you to
your table, cutie?

01:09:15.068 --> 01:09:16.069
Let's go!

01:09:16.361 --> 01:09:18.033
About time
this group had a night.

01:09:18.237 --> 01:09:20.238
Let the good times roll!

01:09:21.741 --> 01:09:24.415
Here you go.
Bottoms up, Yo-Yo.

01:09:24.743 --> 01:09:25.745
Oh, I can't.

01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:27.538
Why? You're 21, right?

01:09:27.747 --> 01:09:30.626
Yeah, but my morn says
alcohol numbs the brain.

01:09:30.957 --> 01:09:33.506
I'm not saying a shot of
tequila is the first step

01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:35.133
on the journey
to self-respect...

01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:39.725
...but maybe it's a step in
the right direction. Maybe?

01:09:40.968 --> 01:09:42.310
Your call.

01:09:42.553 --> 01:09:43.725
One shot.

01:09:44.721 --> 01:09:45.723
Bang it, Yo!

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:48.939
To the night
you'll never remember!

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:02.908
Yeah!

01:10:03.491 --> 01:10:04.834
He's getting down!

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:20.342
Look what we got cooking here.

01:10:22.969 --> 01:10:25.813
Exchangeagram moment, bitches!

01:10:28.725 --> 01:10:30.398
Ready for your first lap dance?

01:10:30.643 --> 01:10:32.737
Are you kidding?
Yo-Yo stays ready

01:10:32.812 --> 01:10:34.155
so he doesn't
have to get ready.

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:37.571
This is Tapioca. She's studying
to be a dental assistant.

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:38.992
Enjoy!

01:10:48.327 --> 01:10:50.079
It happens all the time.

01:10:50.163 --> 01:10:51.790
Some would say it's the point.

01:10:56.794 --> 01:10:58.842
It's all good.

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:02.175
Might want to double up
on the underwear next time.

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:10.650
I got to tell you, the
reboot time is impressive.

01:11:11.225 --> 01:11:12.522
Trifecta.

01:11:13.186 --> 01:11:14.278
Cheers, bud.

01:11:14.353 --> 01:11:15.479
Cheers, cheers.

01:11:44.008 --> 01:11:45.305
No way!

01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:46.807
Hi.

01:11:47.804 --> 01:11:49.605
Is that your dance
teacher from Google?

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:51.983
Go talk to her.

01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:55.812
Yeah, fo shizzle,
I'll just go up and I'm like...

01:11:56.062 --> 01:11:57.735
..."Want to join
the Lyle High Club?"

01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:01.075
Lyle, sometimes the most radical
move is to just be yourself.

01:12:02.485 --> 01:12:04.487
And I really like
the real Lyle.

01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:06.073
Yeah?

01:12:06.155 --> 01:12:07.202
Yeah.

01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:09.909
Go on, you're burning daylight!

01:12:12.912 --> 01:12:14.255
Let's do this.

01:12:22.088 --> 01:12:23.180
Hi.

01:12:23.422 --> 01:12:25.299
Hi.
Hi.

01:12:25.925 --> 01:12:27.643
Hi.
Hi.

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.057
Hi.

01:12:29.136 --> 01:12:32.310
You were really good up there.
I mean, that was amazing!

01:12:32.598 --> 01:12:34.271
Not in like a sexual way.

01:12:34.475 --> 01:12:35.476
Kind of in a sexual way.

01:12:35.768 --> 01:12:40.114
You're very talented. Everything you
do is special is what I'm saying.

01:12:40.314 --> 01:12:42.112
I'm just so embarrassed.

01:12:42.316 --> 01:12:44.819
You're emb... Are you kidding?
Now we're even...

01:12:45.069 --> 01:12:46.912
...because dancing in
your class at Google was

01:12:46.988 --> 01:12:49.491
one of the most embarrassing
moments of my life.

01:12:50.741 --> 01:12:54.086
If it helps, I don't remember
anything specifically awful.

01:12:54.287 --> 01:12:57.131
Oh, poop.
You don't remember.

01:12:57.415 --> 01:12:59.588
That means we're not even.

01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:03.262
There's only one very
unfortunate way to fix that.

01:13:04.046 --> 01:13:05.798
Oh?

01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:11.638
That is burned in my memory.
You can stop.

01:13:12.096 --> 01:13:16.772
How about I stop if and only
if I can buy you a drink?

01:13:17.435 --> 01:13:19.062
I would love that.

01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:22.152
Yeah? Shots?
Yeah.

01:13:22.523 --> 01:13:24.321
Yes. Shots.
Shots.

01:14:06.484 --> 01:14:09.283
I love teaching at Google,
but it's only part-time

01:14:09.362 --> 01:14:11.042
and doesn't cover my
tuition, so I augment.

01:14:11.155 --> 01:14:13.874
No, don't augment. You're
perfect the way you are!

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:15.876
Can I get a dance?

01:14:16.369 --> 01:14:17.541
Not now.
Look, bitch...

01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:19.456
...I don't know
who this geek is,

01:14:19.538 --> 01:14:21.586
but I spent a shitload
of dinero here,

01:14:21.666 --> 01:14:22.667
and I expect to nut.

01:14:23.084 --> 01:14:26.258
Yeah, no, I'm totally
a geek, Biff Tannen.

01:14:26.504 --> 01:14:27.704
Who's Biff Tannen?

01:14:27.838 --> 01:14:30.512
You're Biff from "Back
to the Future", right?

01:14:30.675 --> 01:14:31.715
Want to take this outside?

01:14:32.009 --> 01:14:34.262
No, I'd rather stay here
and talk to the pretty girl.

01:14:34.512 --> 01:14:35.855
Let's rock, not talk.

01:14:36.013 --> 01:14:37.014
Hey, man.

01:14:37.264 --> 01:14:38.436
Is there a problem?

01:14:38.683 --> 01:14:41.106
It looks like somebody needs
their way older brothers

01:14:41.185 --> 01:14:42.402
to fight for him, huh?

01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:45.614
Oh, it's
the United Colors of Nerd!

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:47.533
Do you all work together?

01:14:47.775 --> 01:14:49.869
I'm going to go out on a limb
and say it's a tech company.

01:14:49.944 --> 01:14:51.446
Free cereal and ugly people.

01:14:51.529 --> 01:14:52.576
Oh! Whoa! Hey!

01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:56.080
Come on, take it easy!
Is this the Jets and the Sharks?

01:14:56.367 --> 01:14:57.607
Why don't you guys
head that way

01:14:57.660 --> 01:14:59.821
and we'll head that way and
never the twain shall meet.

01:14:59.870 --> 01:15:00.871
Have a great night.

01:15:01.539 --> 01:15:02.916
That's a good idea.

01:15:19.223 --> 01:15:21.646
My mother hits harder than you!

01:15:23.769 --> 01:15:25.362
Down goes stranger!

01:15:27.481 --> 01:15:29.324
What's up?
Oh, shit.

01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:31.323
If I see you again,
I'll kill you!

01:15:31.402 --> 01:15:32.995
Hide your kids!
Hide your wife!

01:15:34.155 --> 01:15:35.407
That's how you party!

01:15:38.826 --> 01:15:42.171
We're too hot to party! That's
why they got to kick us out!

01:15:42.413 --> 01:15:44.791
'Cause they're gonna
call the fire department!

01:15:44.957 --> 01:15:46.675
Bring it outside to party!

01:15:48.919 --> 01:15:50.421
Look at that view!

01:15:51.005 --> 01:15:54.726
You're not gonna see that on your 4-inch screen.
You got to look up.

01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:59.890
Buddy, you were an animal
out there tonight!

01:16:00.681 --> 01:16:02.854
You were.
Did you have a good time?

01:16:03.059 --> 01:16:04.732
Yeah, it was all right.

01:16:04.894 --> 01:16:06.567
"It was all right."
Why do you do that?

01:16:06.854 --> 01:16:08.197
What do you mean?
Do what?

01:16:08.856 --> 01:16:11.826
Lowball me like that!
I'm not going to take away...

01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:12.993
...your cool guy card if
you admit you give a shit

01:16:13.069 --> 01:16:17.245
about something or, God
forbid, had a great time.

01:16:20.659 --> 01:16:22.411
Um... All right,
it was fun.

01:16:22.661 --> 01:16:24.004
Stewie...

01:16:24.663 --> 01:16:26.256
What?
Come on!

01:16:26.499 --> 01:16:28.922
You want me to say it was
the best night of my life?

01:16:29.168 --> 01:16:30.841
Only if it's true.

01:16:34.173 --> 01:16:36.267
Okay, it was
the best night of my life.

01:16:37.343 --> 01:16:39.516
My Noogler! Come here!

01:16:39.845 --> 01:16:41.188
My Noogler.

01:16:41.597 --> 01:16:44.350
I don't believe there
hasn't been one boyfriend.

01:16:44.683 --> 01:16:47.527
Nope. That's embarrassing.

01:16:48.187 --> 01:16:51.691
It's nothing to be embarrassed of.
You have plenty of time.

01:16:52.358 --> 01:16:53.951
I mean,
you're the whole package.

01:16:54.777 --> 01:16:57.872
You're beautiful. You're smart.
You have great teeth.

01:16:58.197 --> 01:17:02.873
You do. Unbelievable choppers
on the old girl, I mean it!

01:17:03.202 --> 01:17:05.830
And terrific shoes. I'm
always excited to see

01:17:05.913 --> 01:17:08.211
what kind of get-up you're
going to throw together.

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:09.337
That part's true.

01:17:09.416 --> 01:17:11.134
It is true. A lot of
great things going on.

01:17:11.377 --> 01:17:14.301
Some guy will find himself
very lucky to be next to you.

01:17:15.047 --> 01:17:16.139
I'm not so sure.

01:17:16.298 --> 01:17:17.390
Well, I am.

01:17:17.716 --> 01:17:19.718
And I've been
around a little bit.

01:17:20.719 --> 01:17:22.062
I'm positive.

01:17:28.227 --> 01:17:31.731
<i>Hot thing, hot
thing Hot thing, what up with it?</i>

01:17:33.065 --> 01:17:36.740
Lyle! Looks like you hit it
off with Saffron tonight.

01:17:37.069 --> 01:17:38.491
I'm texting her that I love her

01:17:38.654 --> 01:17:40.076
and sending
a picture I just took...

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:43.496
...of little Lyle when he made pee in the bushes.
Look, he's winking.

01:17:44.410 --> 01:17:48.665
Lyle, that's a horrible idea. Don't do that.
You're drunk off your ass.

01:17:48.914 --> 01:17:52.088
I appreciate your concern, but
I'm flying, baby.

01:17:52.585 --> 01:17:55.589
Lyle, you're not flying.
Look, what's 17 squared?

01:17:55.921 --> 01:17:57.423
289, why?

01:17:57.673 --> 01:18:00.017
Give me a harder
question than that.

01:18:00.259 --> 01:18:02.432
Try, uh, maybe
square root of seventeen.

01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:03.850
4.23 maybe?

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:08.025
That's the app. That's
the app we should do.

01:18:08.684 --> 01:18:11.813
A quiz question you
have to answer before

01:18:11.896 --> 01:18:13.694
you can send a drunk text or
a drunk email or phone call.

01:18:13.939 --> 01:18:15.941
Something to protect
you from yourself.

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:17.535
That's good.
Can we do that?

01:18:17.776 --> 01:18:18.777
Hells, yeah!

01:18:19.028 --> 01:18:20.951
Are you shitting me?
I could program

01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:24.034
the shit out of that
on the bus ride home.

01:18:24.283 --> 01:18:26.957
I'll take that as an overwhelming yes!
Come on!

01:18:27.286 --> 01:18:28.287
Let's get back to HQ!

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:29.462
Wait.

01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:32.792
Let's stay five more minutes.
Enjoy the view a little more.

01:18:34.335 --> 01:18:35.678
All right.

01:18:36.962 --> 01:18:38.464
Wow. Yeah.

01:18:54.897 --> 01:18:58.401
The whole world looks like
a giant pinwheel of death.

01:18:58.692 --> 01:19:00.535
Price of making
memories, Stewie.

01:19:00.903 --> 01:19:02.905
I think my liver hurts.

01:19:03.239 --> 01:19:05.583
Astonishingly, your app...

01:19:06.033 --> 01:19:08.877
received ten times more downloads
than any other team's.

01:19:10.537 --> 01:19:12.881
It appears you won
your first challenge.

01:19:13.082 --> 01:19:14.083
How about it?!

01:19:14.708 --> 01:19:15.709
Congratulations.

01:19:15.918 --> 01:19:17.261
Come on, baby!

01:19:17.544 --> 01:19:18.921
The lead!

01:19:20.756 --> 01:19:22.258
Oh, easy there, big guy.

01:19:24.385 --> 01:19:25.887
He gets overexcited.

01:19:26.762 --> 01:19:28.105
Lovely.

01:19:28.931 --> 01:19:30.274
Let it out.

01:19:30.724 --> 01:19:32.101
Let it out, little feller.

01:20:19.148 --> 01:20:21.992
Our Professor X was
way meaner than this guy.

01:20:23.527 --> 01:20:25.200
It wasn't funny at the time.

01:20:33.037 --> 01:20:37.133
What I'm doing is supercharging
my CSS and HTML skills...

01:20:37.374 --> 01:20:39.217
...'cause you can do
both simultaneously.

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:40.803
HTML5, right?

01:20:41.045 --> 01:20:44.470
That's one step beyond
the HTML5 they mentioned

01:20:44.548 --> 01:20:46.050
the other day with
the CSS3, remember?

01:20:46.258 --> 01:20:47.384
No.

01:20:47.468 --> 01:20:49.721
When writing code,
you have your choice

01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:52.143
of a number of editors,
such as...

01:20:52.389 --> 01:20:54.062
Emacs, nano and vi, of course.

01:20:54.308 --> 01:20:55.651
What does that mean?

01:20:55.893 --> 01:20:58.737
They have syntax highlighting
and autocomplete. Questions?

01:21:01.565 --> 01:21:04.034
It occurred to me,
why not use Emacs

01:21:04.109 --> 01:21:06.578
rather than vi as the
default editor for Ubuntu?

01:21:07.488 --> 01:21:10.412
That's actually
a very good thought, Nick.

01:21:10.657 --> 01:21:11.749
Thank you.

01:21:11.992 --> 01:21:15.496
Vi versus Emacs is a
constant debate. Moving on.

01:21:30.928 --> 01:21:32.100
Sammy!

01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:34.432
Did you forget an insult?

01:21:34.681 --> 01:21:38.185
Billy, you magnificent son of a bitch!
How's unemployment?

01:21:38.435 --> 01:21:39.607
<i>Come work for me.</i>

01:21:39.853 --> 01:21:41.696
Sammy, I thought you retired.

01:21:41.939 --> 01:21:46.285
I did, Nicky, but I have stumbled
onto King Solomon's Mines.

01:21:46.610 --> 01:21:48.954
Two words: motorized scooters.

01:21:49.279 --> 01:21:51.532
<i>Go to Modesto,
check out old age homes.</i>

01:21:51.782 --> 01:21:53.455
Ah, Sammy, we have a gig.

01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:54.792
We have a new gig.

01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:56.036
We're interns at Google.

01:21:56.370 --> 01:21:58.418
Interns at Google?
Who are you kidding?

01:21:58.497 --> 01:22:01.000
You're salesmen!
This is a sales gig.

01:22:01.208 --> 01:22:02.209
<i>It's a job.</i>

01:22:02.376 --> 01:22:04.720
We've had jobs.
We're building a future.

01:22:05.003 --> 01:22:07.847
And I'm trying to get hard on my
own, but the Cialis is a guarantee.

01:22:08.048 --> 01:22:11.222
<i>You finish this "internship",
who knows what will happen?</i>

01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:13.558
Exactly. Who
knows what will happen?

01:22:13.846 --> 01:22:15.606
That's what I said.
Why are you repeating me?

01:22:15.848 --> 01:22:17.521
Shh! Time for baby
to go night-night.

01:22:17.724 --> 01:22:19.522
<i>Billy, you're cutting out.</i>

01:22:19.893 --> 01:22:21.236
That felt great.

01:22:25.399 --> 01:22:26.821
I'll catch up
with you later, okay?

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:28.410
Okay. See you in a bit.

01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:33.324
If this is being a workaholic,
maybe I should get a glass.

01:22:33.574 --> 01:22:36.248
I have fifteen minutes
until my next meeting.

01:22:36.493 --> 01:22:39.337
You know how we were
talking about regret, and...

01:22:39.663 --> 01:22:41.336
You were talking about regret.

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:44.714
I don't want to add
not asking you out to

01:22:44.793 --> 01:22:46.713
that list, because that
credit card is maxed out.

01:22:47.004 --> 01:22:50.679
So can we establish you are, in
fact, asking me out on a date?

01:22:51.008 --> 01:22:53.761
Yes. And I figure I'm such
a mountain of mistakes

01:22:53.844 --> 01:22:55.846
that going out with me
just once this evening...

01:22:56.096 --> 01:22:58.224
...will be like
packing ten years of

01:22:58.348 --> 01:23:00.521
bad experiences into one night.

01:23:00.809 --> 01:23:01.810
Okay. Fine.

01:23:02.352 --> 01:23:04.025
Yes?
I'm saying yes.

01:23:04.313 --> 01:23:05.986
Great.
I'm in.

01:23:06.857 --> 01:23:08.029
I'll leave you to it.

01:23:08.317 --> 01:23:09.694
Okay. Tonight.

01:23:15.657 --> 01:23:16.829
Hello, William.

01:23:17.201 --> 01:23:18.202
I've been watching you.

01:23:18.494 --> 01:23:20.997
You should choose your words
more carefully in a bathhouse.

01:23:21.205 --> 01:23:22.878
In the words of Nelly:

01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:25.213
"It's gettin' hot in herre."

01:23:25.876 --> 01:23:27.674
It's getting hot
out there, too.

01:23:27.878 --> 01:23:29.551
You definitely
got my attention.

01:23:29.838 --> 01:23:32.182
Okay, I want to go
put my robe on now.

01:23:32.382 --> 01:23:33.850
Enough to do research on you.

01:23:34.718 --> 01:23:36.720
What did we find out?
Let's see.

01:23:37.054 --> 01:23:41.059
Your company was shut down,
your home was foreclosed upon...

01:23:41.391 --> 01:23:43.735
...your credit score
is actually negative.

01:23:44.019 --> 01:23:46.898
That's kind of amazing,
Billy. That's hard to do.

01:23:47.397 --> 01:23:50.742
You try hard, McMahon.
I'll give you that.

01:23:51.568 --> 01:23:54.412
But things never quite
work out for you, do they?

01:23:54.738 --> 01:23:57.708
I could waste my energy
trying to beat you.

01:23:57.908 --> 01:24:02.914
But it seems, given enough time,
you always find a way to fail.

01:24:03.914 --> 01:24:05.587
I just need to
get out of your way.

01:24:06.250 --> 01:24:07.752
So this is me going.

01:24:12.214 --> 01:24:14.057
Only two challenges remain.

01:24:14.258 --> 01:24:16.556
After which,
a mere handful of you

01:24:16.677 --> 01:24:18.930
will be offered
full-time employment.

01:24:19.429 --> 01:24:22.774
The next challenge is manning
the Google helpline.

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:25.603
This is one of the most
difficult jobs we have...

01:24:25.936 --> 01:24:30.237
...combining both customer
relations and product fluency.

01:24:30.774 --> 01:24:33.448
You will be judged on both.

01:24:33.735 --> 01:24:35.078
This...

01:24:35.445 --> 01:24:38.449
...is a very tight
race right now.

01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:42.957
I suggest you study up.

01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:48.070
Okay, let's drill it
and kill it.

01:24:48.083 --> 01:24:51.087
Authorization failure
with Google Drive. Neha.

01:24:51.336 --> 01:24:53.509
Permission's probably
changed. Request access.

01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:55.757
Barn!
Chrome connectivity. Nick.

01:24:56.008 --> 01:24:58.010
Unselect proxy
server for your LAN.

01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:00.934
Nice! Billy, I'm locked out
of my Google Wallet account.

01:25:01.179 --> 01:25:02.681
Is that under
Gmail or Wallet Help?

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:05.855
"I don't know, sir. That's kind
of what I called you for."

01:25:06.184 --> 01:25:10.360
Look, I'm terrific on phones. I can
sell prosciutto to a rabbi, and I have.

01:25:10.606 --> 01:25:12.199
But you're not
selling anything.

01:25:12.441 --> 01:25:14.785
You can't bullshit
your way through this one.

01:25:15.027 --> 01:25:18.372
The only way to nail this
challenge is to study.

01:25:18.614 --> 01:25:20.787
Then study up is
what I'm going to do.

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:25.704
Let me ask you, is there a
blanket statement I could say...

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:28.457
...that could apply to
literally anything?

01:25:28.707 --> 01:25:30.425
And then I either
shove product down

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:33.549
their face or give
them another hotline.

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:37.140
You're tech support, so if you
refer them to another number...

01:25:37.382 --> 01:25:40.977
...your phone will ring again, 'cause
it's your number you referred to.

01:25:41.219 --> 01:25:44.894
I'm suggesting, give me the blanket
thing, so I'm not wrong or right...

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:48.815
...then I either hit them with a real
helpline or push some product on them.

01:25:49.061 --> 01:25:50.984
I can shove product
down their throat.

01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:54.824
You're working too hard. All you have
to do is click the button and read.

01:25:56.485 --> 01:25:57.486
I got it.

01:25:57.736 --> 01:25:59.409
Bam! Done. Read it.

01:25:59.738 --> 01:26:01.490
I got it. I'll do it.

01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:03.413
That's my man, Bill.

01:26:03.742 --> 01:26:05.085
You'll get it.

01:26:10.916 --> 01:26:13.169
Is it just me,
or is this food incredible?

01:26:13.752 --> 01:26:14.753
You're a liar.

01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:16.296
What?

01:26:16.421 --> 01:26:17.782
You were supposed
to be an asshole.

01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:19.682
Come on!

01:26:19.925 --> 01:26:22.098
You were supposed
to pack a decade of

01:26:22.177 --> 01:26:24.930
jerks and bad
dates into one night.

01:26:25.263 --> 01:26:26.264
Remember?

01:26:26.348 --> 01:26:27.440
Now I remember, yes.

01:26:27.516 --> 01:26:30.690
But so far you've
been... totally fine.

01:26:30.936 --> 01:26:32.028
Totally fine?

01:26:32.562 --> 01:26:33.688
Wah-wah.

01:26:33.939 --> 01:26:37.944
I have dropped the ball. I
promised that and didn't deliver.

01:26:38.193 --> 01:26:39.945
Can we get the check, please?

01:26:40.195 --> 01:26:41.538
May we get the check...
Jennifer?

01:26:41.655 --> 01:26:43.032
How'd you know my...?

01:26:43.281 --> 01:26:45.534
It says right here on
this little necklace.

01:26:45.784 --> 01:26:47.957
And now I have the name,
how about the number?

01:26:48.203 --> 01:26:51.207
Oh, I'm just kidding. Or maybe
I'm not kidding.

01:26:51.623 --> 01:26:54.297
You're so cute. Beautiful.

01:26:55.043 --> 01:26:56.636
Did you just hit
on the waitress?

01:26:56.712 --> 01:26:59.807
I did, yes!
The lady asked for a jerk

01:26:59.881 --> 01:27:02.304
and I am trying to
live up to my promise.

01:27:02.801 --> 01:27:06.897
I said ten years of assholes.
You have some ground to cover.

01:27:07.139 --> 01:27:09.141
I think you've
had enough dessert.

01:27:09.474 --> 01:27:11.147
I've been watching
you eat all night.

01:27:11.393 --> 01:27:14.897
I'll take care of this. You
have to watch your figure...

01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:16.152
and you're right
on the borderline.

01:27:16.231 --> 01:27:17.904
You know what they say,

01:27:17.983 --> 01:27:19.735
"A moment on the lips,
forever on the hips."

01:27:19.985 --> 01:27:23.740
Mmm! This is divine! Oh, you do
not know what you are missing.

01:27:23.989 --> 01:27:25.662
That's nice.

01:27:25.907 --> 01:27:29.787
Here's something you aren't missing...
the check. I paid for the cab.

01:27:36.209 --> 01:27:37.381
Bullshit!
Right?

01:27:37.586 --> 01:27:39.429
Wow, a little heart
and everything.

01:27:41.089 --> 01:27:43.433
Why don't you
take care of that?

01:27:43.508 --> 01:27:45.602
The night is still young. I'm
taking you to see some dogfights.

01:27:45.844 --> 01:27:48.313
Rock and roll! I think
we're up to five years.

01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:50.899
All right.

01:27:51.099 --> 01:27:52.100
I'll get this.

01:27:52.267 --> 01:27:53.610
Oh!

01:27:53.685 --> 01:27:55.028
That's amazing!

01:28:00.275 --> 01:28:04.200
"In Gmail, a 'bad request'
message shows if..."

01:28:04.863 --> 01:28:06.206
"...shows if..."

01:28:06.531 --> 01:28:08.033
"...your Internet is down."

01:28:09.618 --> 01:28:10.915
Son of a bitch!

01:28:10.994 --> 01:28:12.166
It shows...

01:28:12.245 --> 01:28:14.748
Jesus Christ! You scared
the shit out of me!

01:28:15.207 --> 01:28:18.882
...If your browser has
a bad or outdated cookie.

01:28:20.545 --> 01:28:21.888
Wait, you could...
Hmm?

01:28:23.381 --> 01:28:28.228
Yes, I can hear everything. I'm not
actually listening to anything.

01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:30.472
It allows me to be with myself.

01:28:30.889 --> 01:28:33.563
I'm not very good
with other humans.

01:28:38.021 --> 01:28:39.694
I'm not very good
with Gmail support.

01:28:39.981 --> 01:28:42.075
No, actually,
you're quite horrible.

01:28:43.693 --> 01:28:46.697
You can do this.
This can be learned.

01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:48.703
But those kids...

01:28:49.032 --> 01:28:53.538
...the way they look at you...
you have a way with people.

01:28:57.707 --> 01:28:59.209
That's a lost art.

01:28:59.876 --> 01:29:01.048
Go again.

01:29:01.711 --> 01:29:02.883
Go again.

01:29:03.547 --> 01:29:05.220
"In Chrome..."

01:29:06.716 --> 01:29:10.186
For you, this is like teaching a
little kid the alphabet, right?

01:29:10.387 --> 01:29:15.393
No, actually, it's like teaching
a kid a letter. Just one letter.

01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:19.188
Your strong point would not
be communicating to humans.

01:29:19.688 --> 01:29:21.031
I know.

01:29:27.237 --> 01:29:31.583
All right, that's my guy. Give it to me straight.
I like it. No chaser.

01:29:31.867 --> 01:29:32.868
We're having fun.

01:29:33.034 --> 01:29:34.081
I am. I hope you are.

01:29:58.101 --> 01:30:01.776
Well, thank you.
That was really awful.

01:30:02.439 --> 01:30:04.282
Ah! You're welcome.
I aim to please.

01:30:04.608 --> 01:30:07.077
I told you I'd
deliver on ten years of

01:30:07.193 --> 01:30:09.616
assholes. I think
I did a pretty good job.

01:30:09.946 --> 01:30:12.290
A little bit too
convincing at times.

01:30:12.532 --> 01:30:14.375
Was it?
That doesn't surprise me.

01:30:14.618 --> 01:30:16.461
When you've been
out there as long as

01:30:16.578 --> 01:30:18.455
I have,
you learn to play the game.

01:30:18.705 --> 01:30:21.049
Oh, I'd be out there,
laying my rap. I'd have

01:30:21.166 --> 01:30:23.544
girls literally thinking
I was an astronomer.

01:30:23.793 --> 01:30:28.299
I'd be pointing out
constellations and harvest moons.

01:30:28.548 --> 01:30:30.221
"Oh, there's Pluto!"

01:30:30.467 --> 01:30:33.141
Then they'd start to fact
check you with the Internet.

01:30:33.803 --> 01:30:37.228
Google singlehandedly cut
into my ability to bullshit.

01:30:37.557 --> 01:30:38.809
Cramping your style?

01:30:38.934 --> 01:30:40.231
Big time.

01:30:40.477 --> 01:30:42.320
Making you a better person?

01:30:42.812 --> 01:30:46.988
True. Ninety percent Google,
ten percent you.

01:30:47.984 --> 01:30:49.986
Just ten percent? Really?

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:52.322
Let's call it twenty percent.

01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:58.833
You know, um...

01:31:01.748 --> 01:31:04.092
...I really didn't
expect to like you.

01:31:06.628 --> 01:31:08.801
I didn't think
you'd like me, either.

01:31:17.305 --> 01:31:18.648
Thank you.

01:31:24.145 --> 01:31:26.489
That was my ride home.

01:31:28.817 --> 01:31:30.160
I know.

01:31:40.328 --> 01:31:43.332
<i>Good morning.
Welcome to the Google Helpline.</i>

01:31:43.623 --> 01:31:46.627
You will man the phones for one hour.
Before you begin...

01:31:46.835 --> 01:31:50.009
I'm so ready for this thing.
I was up all night studying.

01:31:50.338 --> 01:31:52.340
This is where Team Lyle
takes the lead.

01:31:52.632 --> 01:31:55.055
...The log file icon,
accessing your account,

01:31:55.176 --> 01:31:57.645
so we can review
your work later.

01:31:58.847 --> 01:32:00.349
The Helpline...

01:32:01.141 --> 01:32:02.188
...is open.

01:32:02.684 --> 01:32:05.528
Google Helpline. My name's Billy.
How can I help you?

01:32:05.812 --> 01:32:07.860
So you're locked
out of your Gmail.

01:32:07.981 --> 01:32:10.029
Well, the good news
is Uncle Bill here...

01:32:10.316 --> 01:32:11.818
...has a key under the mat.

01:32:12.027 --> 01:32:15.031
I'm going to play a hunch here.
Delete all your cookies.

01:32:15.363 --> 01:32:17.536
Did that work? Great.

01:32:17.866 --> 01:32:21.086
You probably have too many
Gmails open at the same time.

01:32:21.286 --> 01:32:23.630
Go ahead and
close a couple and...

01:32:23.872 --> 01:32:27.547
Okay, great. Thank you.
Call with anything else.

01:32:28.043 --> 01:32:30.967
Not a problem. You want to
click on the gear icon,

01:32:31.046 --> 01:32:32.548
then Settings,
then Advanced Settings.

01:32:32.797 --> 01:32:35.892
Yeah, you can have the same tabs
open across all your devices.

01:32:36.134 --> 01:32:38.262
So the browser
windows keep opening

01:32:38.386 --> 01:32:40.559
and you're telling me
that's from Amazon?

01:32:40.805 --> 01:32:42.148
You need anti-virus software.

01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:45.564
Let's fix that before the wife
gets home... am I making sense?

01:32:45.810 --> 01:32:48.484
Sign into Google Wallet
and update your credit card.

01:32:49.147 --> 01:32:50.148
That's the problem.

01:32:50.398 --> 01:32:51.900
Switching time
zones causes a Calendar

01:32:52.067 --> 01:32:53.569
sync issue.
Are you on vacation?

01:32:53.902 --> 01:32:54.903
Miami, nice.

01:32:55.153 --> 01:32:56.826
Let's get your cache
cleared up, then I'll

01:32:56.905 --> 01:32:59.658
talk you through the best
Cuban spots in town.

01:32:59.908 --> 01:33:01.581
Google Helpline,
this is Graham.

01:33:01.826 --> 01:33:03.999
Your device isn't compatible
with Google Play.

01:33:04.245 --> 01:33:06.748
I want you out there
salsa-ing and grinding up...

01:33:07.082 --> 01:33:10.507
...against a complete stranger,
having a good time

01:33:10.585 --> 01:33:12.087
doing the wrong things.
Are we on the same page?

01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:15.765
See the box at the bottom of your window?
Click it twice.

01:33:16.091 --> 01:33:18.890
<i>Come on, baby, let me
hear you do that conga</i>

01:33:18.968 --> 01:33:20.936
<i>You know you can't
control it any longer</i>

01:33:21.262 --> 01:33:22.263
Time's up!

01:33:22.514 --> 01:33:25.188
So soon? I was
just getting warmed up!

01:33:25.433 --> 01:33:26.776
Good going here!

01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:28.778
Whoo! Come on,
Ladybug!

01:33:29.604 --> 01:33:33.234
Please submit your log files so
I may review your work later.

01:33:33.608 --> 01:33:35.952
Happily. Just click
the blue button.

01:33:36.277 --> 01:33:37.369
Where's that?

01:33:37.487 --> 01:33:38.579
Blue button, upper left.

01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:42.125
Mine's not blue, it's grey.
I can't click it.

01:33:42.450 --> 01:33:43.451
The blue one.

01:33:43.535 --> 01:33:44.616
Mine won't click.
It's grey.

01:33:44.786 --> 01:33:45.912
Is anyone else's grey?

01:33:46.121 --> 01:33:48.123
Did you not hear
my opening remarks?

01:33:48.456 --> 01:33:50.129
Most of them.

01:33:50.416 --> 01:33:52.293
I was getting in the zone.

01:33:52.585 --> 01:33:55.304
I was very clear that
you have to log into

01:33:55.380 --> 01:33:57.599
your account so I could
review your work later.

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:01.144
The good news is
you reviewed my work now.

01:34:01.427 --> 01:34:02.895
You don't need
the instant replay

01:34:03.012 --> 01:34:04.480
because you saw
the touchdown live.

01:34:05.265 --> 01:34:08.314
I don't really understand that
analogy, but I do know...

01:34:08.601 --> 01:34:11.775
...attention to detail is of
paramount importance here...

01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:14.153
...and my instructions
were explicit.

01:34:14.482 --> 01:34:16.155
If there is no recording...

01:34:16.442 --> 01:34:18.991
it's as if you
didn't even show up today.

01:34:21.489 --> 01:34:23.491
Except I did show up.
I'm right here.

01:34:23.783 --> 01:34:27.504
Well, according to
your log, you're not.

01:34:28.163 --> 01:34:30.837
And since every
intern must complete...

01:34:31.124 --> 01:34:34.344
...the challenge in order
for your team to be scored...

01:34:35.003 --> 01:34:36.346
...your team...

01:34:36.838 --> 01:34:40.012
...will unfortunately receive
a score... of zero.

01:34:41.301 --> 01:34:42.473
Zero?

01:34:44.179 --> 01:34:46.181
Well done, Mr. McMahon.

01:34:46.681 --> 01:34:49.355
Perhaps more studying,
less pudding.

01:34:49.642 --> 01:34:51.895
Chetty, come on.
You're not going to trip

01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:54.318
us up with a technicality.
He's right here.

01:34:54.564 --> 01:34:57.067
Oh, Billy, Billy.
What have you done?

01:34:57.317 --> 01:34:59.319
It's you lot I feel bad for.

01:34:59.569 --> 01:35:01.242
It's really hard to get here.

01:35:01.571 --> 01:35:03.244
You're probably
pretty intelligent.

01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:05.242
You deserve better.

01:35:05.575 --> 01:35:06.747
I'm sorry.

01:35:09.579 --> 01:35:12.253
It's all right,
<i>El Niño,</i> we'll get them.

01:35:16.419 --> 01:35:18.421
I studied for the test.

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:25.933
Great.
Another win for Team Graham.

01:35:26.179 --> 01:35:27.431
There's only
one challenge left.

01:35:27.555 --> 01:35:28.852
Even if we're perfect,
it won't be enough.

01:35:29.098 --> 01:35:30.099
We had them, too.

01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:33.945
We did, but it's just a little
hiccup, a little adversity.

01:35:34.270 --> 01:35:36.739
Nick, come on.
Billy's a great guy,

01:35:36.856 --> 01:35:39.279
but he kind of
blew it for us today.

01:35:40.026 --> 01:35:41.278
They're right, Nick.

01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:44.744
I just wanted to come
by and let you know...

01:35:44.822 --> 01:35:47.746
I did study last night, I tried my best.
It's just...

01:35:47.825 --> 01:35:50.829
...that today on the phones...
It's my fault.

01:35:50.995 --> 01:35:51.996
And, uh...

01:35:53.164 --> 01:35:55.417
...he was right when he
said you deserved better.

01:35:55.833 --> 01:35:57.801
I'm really sorry
that I cost you.

01:36:07.262 --> 01:36:08.514
Damn.

01:36:13.059 --> 01:36:14.402
Billy, stop!

01:36:14.644 --> 01:36:16.317
I'm not helping anybody here.

01:36:16.562 --> 01:36:19.156
What do you mean?
You're helping those kids!

01:36:19.649 --> 01:36:21.492
Where are you going?

01:36:21.734 --> 01:36:23.657
You going radio silence on me?

01:36:23.903 --> 01:36:26.577
I'm not letting you ride away
from the Garden of Eden!

01:36:26.823 --> 01:36:28.166
I let down the team!

01:36:28.408 --> 01:36:32.163
You didn't letdown the team! Who
cares if you made a mistake?

01:36:32.412 --> 01:36:34.255
I'm not taking
everyone down with me.

01:36:34.497 --> 01:36:37.842
Billy, give me a chance to turn
you with a sports metaphor.

01:36:38.167 --> 01:36:40.670
Damn it, Nick, it's the
best thing for everybody!

01:36:41.004 --> 01:36:43.507
Stop dragging me down
with all your horseshit!

01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:47.344
You're doing great here,
okay? I'm not! I got it!

01:36:48.511 --> 01:36:50.013
Just get off my back.

01:36:50.263 --> 01:36:53.358
How dare you!
How dare you!

01:36:53.683 --> 01:36:56.857
Shame on you!
Put this badge back on!

01:36:57.145 --> 01:36:59.273
If you're going to quit,
quit, but don't

01:36:59.397 --> 01:37:01.525
give me this crap that
it's better for them!

01:37:02.150 --> 01:37:04.152
Come on, Billy!

01:37:25.506 --> 01:37:26.507
Randy?

01:37:27.550 --> 01:37:31.726
I'm Billy McMahon. Sammy sent me?
I'm the new salesman.

01:37:33.723 --> 01:37:35.225
No shit!

01:37:35.558 --> 01:37:37.401
My new partner.

01:37:37.977 --> 01:37:39.900
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen, it has been...</i>

01:37:40.146 --> 01:37:41.648
...an impressive summer.

01:37:42.398 --> 01:37:45.072
One final challenge remains.

01:37:45.902 --> 01:37:47.245
Sales.

01:37:47.653 --> 01:37:49.747
Over a million
companies advertise

01:37:49.906 --> 01:37:52.000
with Google.
Find one that doesn't.

01:37:52.241 --> 01:37:53.242
Convince them.

01:37:53.493 --> 01:37:55.416
The bigger the sale,
the more chance

01:37:55.578 --> 01:37:57.501
you have of taking
this competition.

01:37:57.914 --> 01:37:59.336
The winner will
be announced at our

01:37:59.415 --> 01:38:02.259
final meeting this
afternoon. Good luck.

01:38:02.585 --> 01:38:03.757
Happy hunting!

01:38:04.087 --> 01:38:05.088
On me!

01:38:11.427 --> 01:38:15.432
Sales... done! Those other
bitches are going down!

01:38:15.765 --> 01:38:16.937
Where's Billy?

01:38:17.058 --> 01:38:18.275
He left.

01:38:19.268 --> 01:38:22.693
You heard him. He thought
he was holding us back

01:38:22.772 --> 01:38:24.172
and he didn't want
to talk about it.

01:38:24.690 --> 01:38:26.033
We got to get him back.

01:38:26.275 --> 01:38:28.277
We're a team... you
guys taught us that.

01:38:28.528 --> 01:38:31.873
It was buried under a mountain
of obscure 80s references...

01:38:32.115 --> 01:38:33.788
...and just a ton of...

01:38:34.033 --> 01:38:36.627
...other super
inappropriate bullshit

01:38:36.702 --> 01:38:38.454
I guess was
intended as life lessons...

01:38:38.704 --> 01:38:41.878
...but you did teach us
how to come together, Nick.

01:38:42.125 --> 01:38:45.800
The problem is, when he makes
up his mind on something...

01:38:46.045 --> 01:38:48.889
...Billy has a tendency
to really dig in.

01:38:49.465 --> 01:38:51.308
We may have to do
this without him.

01:38:51.551 --> 01:38:52.643
But, Nick...

01:38:53.052 --> 01:38:55.475
...we wouldn't want to.
Right, guys?

01:39:02.061 --> 01:39:03.062
Hey, Tony!

01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:06.824
Slow it down, man.
Just kidding.

01:39:07.817 --> 01:39:09.490
How long you
worked this territory?

01:39:09.819 --> 01:39:11.162
Three years.

01:39:11.487 --> 01:39:14.832
It's great... you build a
relationship with the customer.

01:39:15.241 --> 01:39:17.369
Then they die.

01:39:17.452 --> 01:39:22.458
You resell scooters with 25, 35 miles
on them, tops. Everybody wins!

01:39:23.332 --> 01:39:25.334
Hey! Look who's back!

01:39:25.668 --> 01:39:27.011
Hey, Randy!

01:39:30.256 --> 01:39:31.428
Hey, old timer.

01:39:31.674 --> 01:39:33.176
Hey, Randy.

01:39:33.509 --> 01:39:34.852
What do you want?

01:39:35.344 --> 01:39:38.518
Treat them like shit...
makes them want you more.

01:39:39.182 --> 01:39:41.025
Everybody, listen up!

01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:43.193
This is my new
tail gunner, Billy!

01:39:43.436 --> 01:39:46.781
Billy, tell them about that
sweet ride you pulled up on.

01:39:47.023 --> 01:39:49.367
Oh, you mean
the brand new X-70.

01:39:49.692 --> 01:39:52.787
It has an eight-hour
motor, and a

01:39:52.862 --> 01:39:54.742
rear-mounted stainless
sleeve for your oxy tank.

01:39:55.072 --> 01:39:57.621
You have no idea how much
boning goes on here.

01:39:57.867 --> 01:40:01.713
It's amazing. Check this one
out... Ethel, that's her name.

01:40:02.038 --> 01:40:03.756
She calls my junk the "cocoon".

01:40:03.831 --> 01:40:05.378
Says it makes her feel younger.

01:40:05.625 --> 01:40:08.128
Lowered her blood pressure.
I'm not fighting it.

01:40:08.377 --> 01:40:11.051
I'm a life-giver and
a lovemaker. Ethel!

01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:12.552
Ethel!

01:40:13.049 --> 01:40:15.723
What's up, girl? Look who's back!

01:40:16.552 --> 01:40:18.225
Come here, boo.
Who's your friend?

01:40:18.804 --> 01:40:20.056
Billy!

01:40:20.556 --> 01:40:22.149
What are you doing here?

01:40:22.391 --> 01:40:23.938
What are you doing here?

01:40:24.227 --> 01:40:25.900
Billy!
Hi.

01:40:26.229 --> 01:40:29.733
Ethel and Doris tell me they're
up for a little group play.

01:40:29.982 --> 01:40:31.325
Can I count you in?

01:40:32.652 --> 01:40:34.404
What the shit?

01:40:35.404 --> 01:40:37.907
Uh... I'm sorry. Randy, this
is my old partner, Nick.

01:40:38.157 --> 01:40:40.831
Nick, this is my
new partner, Randy.

01:40:42.245 --> 01:40:43.747
Welcome to the jungle, ese.

01:40:44.580 --> 01:40:46.082
Billy, can I count you in?

01:40:46.582 --> 01:40:47.754
Give me a second here.

01:40:47.917 --> 01:40:49.089
No problem.

01:40:49.335 --> 01:40:50.375
What are you doing?

01:40:50.503 --> 01:40:51.675
New partner, huh?

01:40:51.796 --> 01:40:53.013
I'm a salesman.
I sell things.

01:40:53.256 --> 01:40:56.931
I remember another guy
who was selling mattresses...

01:40:57.176 --> 01:41:01.181
...when in walks this behemoth! Big guy.
Big mouth. Big dreams.

01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:03.478
He made this old
son of a gun remember

01:41:03.599 --> 01:41:05.693
dreams are still
floating around out there.

01:41:05.935 --> 01:41:07.687
You just got to
reach out and grab them.

01:41:07.937 --> 01:41:11.282
I reached for my dreams.
I messed it up for everybody.

01:41:11.524 --> 01:41:15.700
You forgot to click a button!
You're not a computer wizard!

01:41:15.945 --> 01:41:17.117
You're also not a pussy.

01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:21.626
You're tough. You grew up in the 70s.
There weren't any computers!

01:41:21.867 --> 01:41:25.963
Or bike helmets or sunscreens or seatbelts.
Did you wear a seatbelt?

01:41:26.289 --> 01:41:27.290
No.

01:41:27.456 --> 01:41:28.457
What was your seatbelt?

01:41:29.292 --> 01:41:30.384
My mom went like this.

01:41:30.626 --> 01:41:33.300
Yeah. And how
did that work out?

01:41:33.713 --> 01:41:34.885
You know. I went
through the windshield.

01:41:35.172 --> 01:41:36.389
Eighty-nine stitches.

01:41:36.465 --> 01:41:38.684
You looked like a little
badass in third grade.

01:41:39.010 --> 01:41:41.684
And were you afraid to get
back in that station wagon?

01:41:41.887 --> 01:41:43.730
Nah.
Five years later...

01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:47.644
...you took out that same car,
without permission from nobody.

01:41:47.852 --> 01:41:50.105
Not your parents,
not Old Man Law.

01:41:50.313 --> 01:41:53.567
Just you and Sally Moran,
parked at the point,

01:41:53.649 --> 01:41:55.526
finger-blasting away!

01:41:55.818 --> 01:41:57.866
Didn't even know
if you were doing it right!

01:41:58.237 --> 01:41:59.910
Where are you going with this?

01:42:00.239 --> 01:42:03.118
I'm saying life is
that station wagon, okay?

01:42:03.367 --> 01:42:06.337
Yeah, sometimes it's going to
throw you through the windshield

01:42:06.412 --> 01:42:08.039
and crack your skull open.

01:42:08.289 --> 01:42:09.632
Maybe even break your heart.

01:42:09.874 --> 01:42:13.629
But every once in a while, it
drops a Sally Moran in your seat.

01:42:13.878 --> 01:42:15.801
We came to Google for a reason.

01:42:16.047 --> 01:42:19.551
I can't promise we'll win,
but we're going back there...

01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:22.644
...to see those kids and we're
going to see it through.

01:42:22.887 --> 01:42:25.561
Now you get your ass
back in that car and ride.

01:42:25.806 --> 01:42:29.151
You hear me, Billy
Bojangles McMahon? Ride!

01:42:33.481 --> 01:42:36.826
"Contextual
targeting technology can...

01:42:37.151 --> 01:42:40.997
...automatically
match your ads...

01:42:41.656 --> 01:42:43.329
...to webpages...

01:42:43.658 --> 01:42:47.504
...that are most relevant
to your business."

01:42:48.829 --> 01:42:50.001
Yo-Yo?

01:42:51.499 --> 01:42:54.844
"Review ad performance
to see impressions...

01:42:55.169 --> 01:42:58.013
...click, cost and
conversion data."

01:42:59.090 --> 01:43:01.843
You seem like good kids and I
appreciate you stopping by...

01:43:02.093 --> 01:43:05.688
...but we're just a family-run business.
We don't do the Internet.

01:43:06.847 --> 01:43:09.851
Thanks for coming. Frankie will
get you a slice on the way out.

01:43:18.943 --> 01:43:20.115
Oi, oi!

01:43:20.361 --> 01:43:21.362
Oh, great.

01:43:21.612 --> 01:43:23.285
Lovely.
This guy.

01:43:23.698 --> 01:43:26.292
Saw you checked in here on
foursquare, so we stopped by.

01:43:26.784 --> 01:43:28.957
That's really creepy.
Is that all?

01:43:29.203 --> 01:43:31.376
It is all, actually.
We just closed

01:43:31.497 --> 01:43:33.716
a sale at a coffee shop
down the street.

01:43:33.958 --> 01:43:37.462
Your chances of catching up to
us went from zero to piss all.

01:43:37.878 --> 01:43:41.223
Now if you'll excuse us, we have
to get to the final meeting.

01:43:41.549 --> 01:43:44.894
Get those jobs of which we're
so profoundly deserving.

01:43:45.886 --> 01:43:46.887
Zach?

01:43:47.221 --> 01:43:48.564
Eyes off the pizza.

01:43:48.889 --> 01:43:51.733
God made you lactose
intolerant for a reason.

01:43:52.393 --> 01:43:53.895
You're so fat.

01:43:55.646 --> 01:43:56.989
You're so fat.

01:43:57.648 --> 01:43:58.820
Let's go!

01:43:59.066 --> 01:44:00.067
On me!

01:44:06.824 --> 01:44:08.576
What a douche!

01:44:11.746 --> 01:44:12.747
Guys.

01:44:20.588 --> 01:44:22.090
Welcome back, Billy boy.

01:44:22.423 --> 01:44:23.515
Good to be with you.

01:44:23.632 --> 01:44:24.758
What happened there?

01:44:25.009 --> 01:44:27.353
Uh, well, he didn't bite,
so it didn't go well.

01:44:27.595 --> 01:44:29.475
You know who else
it didn't go well for?

01:44:29.597 --> 01:44:30.598
Lay it on us.

01:44:30.848 --> 01:44:33.021
That's right,
the steel town girl, Alex.

01:44:33.267 --> 01:44:36.771
When she finally got her shot,
she took a tumble and fell.

01:44:37.104 --> 01:44:40.108
But she picked
herself back up...

01:44:40.357 --> 01:44:43.201
...tightened that little ass,
pumped her legs...

01:44:43.444 --> 01:44:47.449
...and danced herself right back
into a slot at that dance school.

01:44:47.948 --> 01:44:49.950
And that's what
we're going to do.

01:44:50.701 --> 01:44:52.795
Tighten your asses, let's go.

01:44:53.454 --> 01:44:55.206
Let's get her done, boys.

01:44:56.791 --> 01:44:59.294
Guys, we've always done
things the same way...

01:44:59.376 --> 01:45:01.799
Yellow Pages, flyers,
San Jose Mercury News.

01:45:02.129 --> 01:45:04.473
We're all creatures
of habit, Sal.

01:45:04.590 --> 01:45:06.888
We like what we know,
no question.

01:45:06.967 --> 01:45:09.265
But you know what the
scariest thing in life is?

01:45:09.345 --> 01:45:11.973
The thing in life that
frightens us the most?

01:45:12.932 --> 01:45:14.058
Change.

01:45:14.141 --> 01:45:16.644
I think most people
are set in their ways.

01:45:16.977 --> 01:45:18.979
I know I need
change to come along

01:45:19.104 --> 01:45:21.152
and kick me in
the ass to get me moving.

01:45:21.398 --> 01:45:23.400
Guys, I know
where you're going.

01:45:24.151 --> 01:45:25.631
But I'm not changing anything.

01:45:26.153 --> 01:45:29.657
Like I told your friends,
we're getting by okay.

01:45:29.907 --> 01:45:31.875
Sal, if you fight for your
limitations, you get to keep them.

01:45:31.951 --> 01:45:34.170
You're getting by okay.

01:45:34.411 --> 01:45:36.084
Okay isn't good.

01:45:36.330 --> 01:45:38.003
Okay isn't great, or fantastic.

01:45:38.123 --> 01:45:39.841
I'm starting to
think he's selfish!

01:45:40.084 --> 01:45:42.257
I don't want to get
sideways with you...

01:45:42.503 --> 01:45:47.179
...you're as big as a barn! But you're an artist!
This is great pizza!

01:45:47.258 --> 01:45:49.101
Picasso with pepperoni!

01:45:49.176 --> 01:45:51.975
And don't even get me
started on the sauce.

01:45:52.054 --> 01:45:54.102
Is there nutmeg in there?
I respect the fact...

01:45:54.348 --> 01:45:57.022
...you don't want to divulge, but
if I'm right, don't say anything.

01:45:59.353 --> 01:46:00.445
Exactly!

01:46:00.688 --> 01:46:01.728
There's your answer!

01:46:02.022 --> 01:46:03.194
Come on!

01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:05.784
All I'm saying is,
why should Papa John's...

01:46:06.026 --> 01:46:08.700
make all the dough when Papa
Sal has the better sauce?

01:46:08.946 --> 01:46:12.792
You sound like him. He wants
to open a Sal's in Los Gatos.

01:46:13.033 --> 01:46:15.536
The big chains are killing us.
We barely stay afloat.

01:46:15.786 --> 01:46:17.914
When you franchise,
you lose quality.

01:46:18.038 --> 01:46:20.211
You lose the taste
that people trust.

01:46:20.457 --> 01:46:23.131
You want to know
why my sauce is better?

01:46:23.377 --> 01:46:26.381
I go to the farmers' market every day.
I buy tomatoes...

01:46:26.630 --> 01:46:28.974
...get the basil,
the oregano.

01:46:29.383 --> 01:46:34.230
I know these people. I'm part of
the fabric of this neighborhood.

01:46:35.139 --> 01:46:36.482
That's good enough for me.

01:46:36.724 --> 01:46:39.728
Sal, that's better than good enough.
That's the best.

01:46:39.977 --> 01:46:42.071
We don't want you to
abandon the neighborhood.

01:46:42.897 --> 01:46:46.743
All we're saying is, what if your
neighborhood got a little bit bigger?

01:46:47.067 --> 01:46:51.072
Take a look at this, Sal. These are
all people who love your pizza.

01:46:51.405 --> 01:46:53.078
Talk about word of mouth, huh?

01:46:53.324 --> 01:46:55.167
Don't you want to
talk back to them?

01:46:55.242 --> 01:46:57.791
There are almost as many
people from Los Gatos

01:46:57.870 --> 01:46:59.747
searching for Sal's as
there are in Palo Alto.

01:46:59.997 --> 01:47:04.753
If there was a location closer
to them, they'd be regulars.

01:47:05.085 --> 01:47:06.883
Boom! Just found
a great commercial spot

01:47:06.962 --> 01:47:09.181
on Los Gatos Boulevard,
just hit the market.

01:47:09.256 --> 01:47:11.634
It's .3 miles away from
the nearest farmers' market.

01:47:11.717 --> 01:47:13.594
You can smell the tomatoes
from your door.

01:47:13.677 --> 01:47:14.678
Farm to table!

01:47:14.929 --> 01:47:16.101
F to T!

01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:19.104
F to T is exactly right,
Gomer Lyle!

01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:23.196
We're not asking you to
abandon the artistry, just...

01:47:23.437 --> 01:47:25.940
...expand the reach a little.
At the end of the

01:47:26.023 --> 01:47:28.242
day, the kids have
their information.

01:47:28.442 --> 01:47:31.116
It's all accurate. I get it,
and I know you do, too.

01:47:31.612 --> 01:47:35.116
Sal, I can't blame you
for being a little afraid.

01:47:35.449 --> 01:47:39.704
Hell, we were scared for a long
time out there, grinding it out.

01:47:39.954 --> 01:47:43.208
And Lord knows I've fallen on
my ass more than a time or two.

01:47:43.457 --> 01:47:45.300
But I promise you something.

01:47:45.626 --> 01:47:47.128
You lift your head up...

01:47:47.252 --> 01:47:49.846
...and take a breath...

01:47:50.547 --> 01:47:52.891
...there are a lot of great
possibilities out there.

01:47:53.634 --> 01:47:56.137
New customers, new franchise...

01:47:56.470 --> 01:48:00.316
...just the tip of the iceberg. It's
waiting at the click of a button.

01:48:02.768 --> 01:48:04.611
Everybody's
searching for something.

01:48:04.979 --> 01:48:06.652
They're searching for you.

01:48:06.981 --> 01:48:08.824
We just want to
help them find you.

01:48:15.698 --> 01:48:17.871
T.G.I.F., Nooglers!

01:48:18.325 --> 01:48:19.668
All right!

01:48:21.996 --> 01:48:25.000
Easy, easy. It's okay.

01:48:25.332 --> 01:48:27.460
Today marks not only
the end of the week,

01:48:27.584 --> 01:48:29.712
but the end of
the summer's internships.

01:48:30.045 --> 01:48:31.137
I know.

01:48:31.213 --> 01:48:33.011
As you see through these images

01:48:33.173 --> 01:48:35.016
behind me,
it's been quite a journey.

01:48:35.259 --> 01:48:38.012
A lot of memories,
a lot of bonds were made.

01:48:38.262 --> 01:48:41.106
Kind of reminds me of the
first time I... All right.

01:48:41.348 --> 01:48:43.851
Today we reveal
the intern team...

01:48:44.184 --> 01:48:46.278
...that will be
awarded jobs here.

01:48:47.354 --> 01:48:50.028
Sadly, one team
has not returned, so...

01:48:50.357 --> 01:48:52.780
...therefore I am
forced to calculate the

01:48:52.901 --> 01:48:55.370
results with their score
as an incomplete.

01:49:01.702 --> 01:49:03.204
We have a victor.

01:49:04.705 --> 01:49:06.378
Congratulations...

01:49:24.558 --> 01:49:25.559
What's going on?

01:49:27.061 --> 01:49:28.404
<i>What a feeling</i>

01:49:30.147 --> 01:49:32.491
<i>Being's believing</i>

01:49:33.067 --> 01:49:34.910
Okay, calm down!

01:49:35.152 --> 01:49:39.157
<i>Pictures come alive You can
dance right through your life</i>

01:49:42.159 --> 01:49:43.832
<i>Take your passion</i>

01:49:45.245 --> 01:49:48.089
<i>And make it happen</i>

01:49:49.416 --> 01:49:54.092
<i>Pictures come alive You can
dance right through your life</i>

01:49:57.424 --> 01:49:59.097
<i>What a feeling</i>

01:49:59.343 --> 01:50:00.686
Nice!

01:50:09.603 --> 01:50:11.276
Come on!

01:50:16.693 --> 01:50:18.787
Extra toppings
on this one, boss.

01:50:19.363 --> 01:50:20.364
I see that.

01:50:27.037 --> 01:50:29.165
Yeah!

01:50:29.289 --> 01:50:30.882
That's enough!

01:50:31.125 --> 01:50:32.968
That's enough!!

01:50:35.879 --> 01:50:38.052
Lovely theatrics,
but the jig is up.

01:50:38.298 --> 01:50:40.721
It's too late. Rules
are rules, right, Chetty?

01:50:40.968 --> 01:50:42.811
Yes. Rules are rules.

01:50:43.470 --> 01:50:46.314
And the rules state that
every team has the right...

01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:49.234
...until the announcement is
made to turn in their sales.

01:50:49.810 --> 01:50:53.986
So, in spite of your lack of
punctuality, which is astounding...

01:50:55.149 --> 01:50:58.995
...I have no choice but to
accept this submission...

01:50:59.403 --> 01:51:01.083
...and to recalculate.

01:51:01.488 --> 01:51:03.490
Go ahead. Recalculate.

01:51:03.824 --> 01:51:07.328
One sale to a small family pizza
joint won't make a difference.

01:51:07.578 --> 01:51:10.957
It does seem that Mr. Hawtrey
is correct once again.

01:51:11.039 --> 01:51:12.165
Boom!

01:51:12.249 --> 01:51:15.844
The sales from one shop
on the last challenge...

01:51:16.044 --> 01:51:18.046
...are not enough to
put you in the lead.

01:51:18.338 --> 01:51:19.339
I'm sorry, bud.

01:51:21.175 --> 01:51:22.176
But...

01:51:23.844 --> 01:51:25.187
...this...

01:51:25.512 --> 01:51:27.185
...is not one shop.

01:51:27.681 --> 01:51:29.354
You see, this...

01:51:30.184 --> 01:51:34.690
is a blossoming franchise with endless
possibilities, thanks to you.

01:51:35.022 --> 01:51:39.027
And what you have done as a
team is connect to people.

01:51:39.359 --> 01:51:41.703
And connect those
people to information.

01:51:42.029 --> 01:51:44.373
Which is what we do.

01:51:44.865 --> 01:51:47.709
And more than that, you
have the courage to dream.

01:51:48.035 --> 01:51:53.041
In spite of your obvious
and astonishing limitations...

01:51:53.874 --> 01:51:55.876
...you never gave up
on that dream.

01:51:56.877 --> 01:51:58.049
So...

01:51:58.545 --> 01:51:59.717
...gentlemen...

01:52:00.547 --> 01:52:01.673
...and lady...

01:52:01.882 --> 01:52:03.384
Whoa, whoa, hold on.

01:52:03.717 --> 01:52:06.721
Chetty, no offense, you're
a glorified babysitter.

01:52:07.054 --> 01:52:09.898
Let's get somebody down here
who means something.

01:52:10.224 --> 01:52:11.521
I'm right here.

01:52:11.642 --> 01:52:12.894
Terrific.

01:52:15.896 --> 01:52:18.900
Graham, please
meet Mr. Anderson.

01:52:19.191 --> 01:52:20.238
You know this guy?

01:52:20.525 --> 01:52:24.200
I should think so. Andrew
here is the head of Search...

01:52:24.404 --> 01:52:27.203
...a rather important
position here at Google.

01:52:27.407 --> 01:52:29.034
Honored... It's an honor.

01:52:29.243 --> 01:52:31.917
Look at you, Headphones. A
little mystery behind the boy.

01:52:32.204 --> 01:52:33.251
How do you know him?

01:52:33.538 --> 01:52:37.088
We were encouraged to reach
out to experienced Googlers.

01:52:37.376 --> 01:52:41.256
To reach out to other Googlers,
not just kiss their asses.

01:52:41.546 --> 01:52:44.265
You see,
these interns are smart...

01:52:45.092 --> 01:52:46.435
...collaborative...

01:52:46.927 --> 01:52:48.770
pretty...
Thank you.

01:52:49.096 --> 01:52:52.771
...and just weird enough
to make them interesting.

01:52:53.100 --> 01:52:56.775
Also, they came
together as a team...

01:52:57.104 --> 01:52:58.947
...to do something here.

01:52:59.273 --> 01:53:02.277
Their Googliness is
truly off the charts.

01:53:02.609 --> 01:53:06.614
Oh, stop with the "Googliness".
What does that even mean?

01:53:06.947 --> 01:53:09.416
The fact that you
don't know what it means

01:53:09.533 --> 01:53:11.956
is why you will
never work here.

01:53:13.787 --> 01:53:14.959
Also...

01:53:15.414 --> 01:53:19.089
...you just made me use a bunch of
words in front of a ton of people.

01:53:19.334 --> 01:53:21.678
Look at me... you're a
real dick for doing that.

01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:25.265
Look at me again. And I know
that your accent is bullshit.

01:53:25.841 --> 01:53:27.013
What?

01:53:29.678 --> 01:53:30.850
So...

01:53:35.183 --> 01:53:36.856
...welcome to Google.

01:53:41.648 --> 01:53:42.740
All right!

01:53:44.109 --> 01:53:45.281
Yes!

01:53:53.452 --> 01:53:54.795
I have a job!

01:53:55.037 --> 01:53:56.710
I have a job!

01:53:57.039 --> 01:54:00.885
Why are you getting up?
I should be the winner.

01:54:01.626 --> 01:54:03.128
I hope you're all happy.

01:54:03.211 --> 01:54:06.340
Maybe if I had a team of
equals who contributed

01:54:06.423 --> 01:54:08.425
once in a while, this
wouldn't have happened.

01:54:08.884 --> 01:54:11.137
What do you have
to say for yourself, eh?

01:54:12.220 --> 01:54:14.063
I think it's time
to fake an injury.

01:54:14.306 --> 01:54:16.308
What are you...

01:54:16.391 --> 01:54:17.483
Ohh!

01:54:17.559 --> 01:54:18.560
Man down!

01:54:20.228 --> 01:54:23.402
Chetty, I appreciate
what you said back there.

01:54:23.648 --> 01:54:25.742
You had us figured
wrong from the start.

01:54:25.984 --> 01:54:27.577
He voted for you
from the start.

01:54:27.903 --> 01:54:29.075
What?

01:54:29.321 --> 01:54:31.824
Mr. Chetty was
the deciding vote.

01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:34.640
I didn't have a fancy education
like most of the people here.

01:54:34.701 --> 01:54:37.170
I had to work hard
to get where I am.

01:54:37.579 --> 01:54:41.584
I recognized a similar tenacity in
you two, so I took a chance on you.

01:54:42.751 --> 01:54:45.095
You did test my faith
a few times.

01:54:46.254 --> 01:54:47.927
Basically, the entire time.

01:54:48.256 --> 01:54:50.099
But I'm glad you
proved me right.

01:54:50.592 --> 01:54:53.266
Chetty,
thanks for betting on us.

01:54:58.517 --> 01:55:01.361
It looks like you'll be
seeing a lot more of me here.

01:55:01.686 --> 01:55:03.939
So it does.
Congratulations.

01:55:04.022 --> 01:55:05.023
Thank you.

01:55:05.857 --> 01:55:06.858
The other night...

01:55:07.359 --> 01:55:08.611
It was fun.

01:55:08.860 --> 01:55:09.827
It was fun.

01:55:09.903 --> 01:55:11.826
Right?
Yeah.

01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:16.543
No regrets.

01:55:17.702 --> 01:55:18.874
No.

01:55:31.633 --> 01:55:34.136
Let's get to that warm,
fuzzy part.

01:55:34.344 --> 01:55:35.687
That's not going to happen.

01:55:37.806 --> 01:55:40.559
I love him even more.
He leaves it cold like that.

01:55:40.892 --> 01:55:43.896
You keep playing hard to get,
you'll find yourself alone!

01:55:44.146 --> 01:55:45.693
We're
not having a beer together.

01:55:45.772 --> 01:55:47.900
We're going to have five.
We're equals now.

01:55:47.983 --> 01:55:49.075
No, we're not.

01:55:49.151 --> 01:55:50.494
Yes, we are!
No, we're not.

01:55:50.735 --> 01:55:52.328
Let's go find more interns.

01:55:52.446 --> 01:55:54.073
Please stop talking to me.

01:55:54.322 --> 01:55:55.414
We'll get drunk!

01:56:03.415 --> 01:56:05.509
Have a great
senior year. We'll keep

01:56:05.625 --> 01:56:07.343
your desk chairs warm.
Team Lyle!

01:56:07.461 --> 01:56:09.008
Team Lyle!

01:56:11.089 --> 01:56:13.091
Yo-Yo! Come! Now!

01:56:13.425 --> 01:56:14.768
Mom, I need a minute.

01:56:15.010 --> 01:56:16.512
We need to...
Mom.

01:56:16.928 --> 01:56:20.774
I'm saying good-bye to my friends.
I'm taking a minute.

01:56:21.266 --> 01:56:22.438
Okay?

01:56:29.274 --> 01:56:31.777
You grew an eyebrow,
Yo-Yo! Come on!

01:56:32.110 --> 01:56:35.455
Okay, you riff-raff, get out of here!
See you down the road.

01:56:35.947 --> 01:56:37.039
Thank you, Captain.

01:56:37.157 --> 01:56:38.283
Thank you, Big B.

01:56:40.785 --> 01:56:42.128
My Khaleesi.

01:56:42.245 --> 01:56:43.622
My sun and stars.

01:56:44.122 --> 01:56:46.124
Want to get weird in a nap pod?

01:56:46.374 --> 01:56:49.878
So, don't be a stranger.
Shoot me a text sometime.

01:56:50.128 --> 01:56:52.631
Forget that. I'll come
see you in person.

01:56:53.298 --> 01:56:55.847
I'd like that.

01:56:56.968 --> 01:56:58.060
I grew a pair of balls,
did you see?

01:56:58.178 --> 01:56:59.304
A big pair.

01:56:59.554 --> 01:57:00.726
You were amazing!

01:57:00.972 --> 01:57:02.144
They're touching my ankles.

01:57:02.265 --> 01:57:03.482
Okay, we don't need that.

01:57:05.644 --> 01:57:06.987
Congratulations, guys.

01:57:07.312 --> 01:57:08.655
Thank you, boss!

01:57:09.147 --> 01:57:12.947
I did get you a little something.
Not to get too sentimental...

01:57:13.026 --> 01:57:14.994
Whoa! Whoa!

01:57:15.362 --> 01:57:18.536
Look at this high roller!
Busting out the Pappy on me!

01:57:18.865 --> 01:57:20.745
I figured we earned a swig.
Mmm-hmm!

01:57:21.243 --> 01:57:22.369
Hell of a summer, bud.

01:57:22.869 --> 01:57:24.542
Hell of a summer.

01:57:42.931 --> 01:57:44.148
<i>Doo wacko!</i>

01:57:52.941 --> 01:57:57.697
<i>Here is to you, honey
But I'm out of your league</i>

01:57:59.155 --> 01:58:05.504
<i>Never gonna pass me 'Cause I'm out of
your league, your league, your league</i>

01:58:05.579 --> 01:58:10.085
<i>Lookie here, baby
You're coming my way</i>

01:58:11.167 --> 01:58:14.091
<i>But I move like a landslide</i>

01:58:14.170 --> 01:58:17.549
<i>So get out of my way
and stay away</i>

01:58:17.799 --> 01:58:20.427
<i>Up from the floor
on the count of ten</i>

01:58:20.510 --> 01:58:23.810
<i>Oh, you get up, you get
down and you try it again</i>

01:58:23.888 --> 01:58:26.516
<i>Up and down and around again</i>

01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:28.102
British! Listen,
Professor...

01:58:32.522 --> 01:58:33.865
<i>All right</i>

01:58:45.452 --> 01:58:50.128
<i>Time to learn a lesson
Like Pavlov's dog</i>

01:58:51.333 --> 01:58:54.007
<i>If same-ing isn't working</i>

01:58:54.085 --> 01:58:57.305
<i>Why don't you different
instead, instead, instead</i>

01:58:57.380 --> 01:59:01.726
<i>Like Samson and Delilah
Attila and the Huns</i>

01:59:03.470 --> 01:59:04.847
I understand that,
but here we go.

01:59:04.929 --> 01:59:06.306
Go cheek to cheek.

01:59:06.640 --> 01:59:08.313
Yes, yes, I get it.

01:59:08.642 --> 01:59:09.985
Hi, my name is Billy!

01:59:10.226 --> 01:59:11.569
Nick Campbell.

01:59:12.854 --> 01:59:15.778
<i>Oh, you get up, you get
down and you try it again</i>

01:59:16.358 --> 01:59:18.656
<i>Up and down and around again</i>

01:59:18.735 --> 01:59:21.909
<i>Oh, you get up, you get
down and you try it again</i>

01:59:24.908 --> 01:59:28.037
<i>Oh, you get up, you get
down and you try it again</i>

01:59:31.247 --> 01:59:36.247
<i>Oh, you get up, you get
down and you try it again</i>

01:59:46.513 --> 01:59:48.356
Guys, hey.

01:59:48.431 --> 01:59:50.604
Hey.
So, what do you think?

01:59:51.101 --> 01:59:52.694
Cosplay, what can you say?

01:59:52.769 --> 01:59:55.147
I knew you'd love it. Stuart
totally loves it too, now.

01:59:55.271 --> 01:59:56.614
You guys have fun.
Okay, great.

01:59:56.690 --> 01:59:58.112
Don't worry about us,
we're having a great time.

01:59:58.233 --> 01:59:59.359
Don't worry about us,
we're having fun.

01:59:59.442 --> 02:00:01.035
Here we go.
I get it.

02:00:01.111 --> 02:00:02.988
Classics Luke and Han
with Boba Fett.

02:00:03.071 --> 02:00:04.744
Couple of observers,
we're just here to observe.

02:00:04.823 --> 02:00:06.120
It's me.
Kevin!

02:00:06.199 --> 02:00:08.076
What the shit?
Guys.

02:00:08.159 --> 02:00:09.160
Kevin?
Yeah!

02:00:09.285 --> 02:00:12.084
What the hell are you doing here?
Cosby.

02:00:12.205 --> 02:00:14.207
Is it your first time at Cosby?
Excuse me?

02:00:14.290 --> 02:00:16.668
It's my new journey.
And I have you to thank.

02:00:16.751 --> 02:00:18.253
You really pointed
some things out,

02:00:18.336 --> 02:00:20.009
I was being a jerk to people.

02:00:20.088 --> 02:00:21.214
'Cause I was hurting inside.

02:00:21.297 --> 02:00:22.719
Hell, it takes a big man to
admit he's wrong, Kevin.

02:00:22.799 --> 02:00:23.800
Good for you.

02:00:23.967 --> 02:00:26.265
Anyway, I'm gonna dive
back into the fun. Ooh!

02:00:26.344 --> 02:00:27.891
Check out this
hot little number.

02:00:27.971 --> 02:00:31.396
I don't know if it's an
Ewok or a space squirrel.

02:00:31.474 --> 02:00:33.021
I can't wait to rip into that.

02:00:33.101 --> 02:00:34.648
How do you know who's
underneath the mask?

02:00:34.728 --> 02:00:37.698
Look, I don't know what's underneath
the hood, and I don't give a shit.

02:00:37.772 --> 02:00:39.649
I'm insatiable.
Now if you'll excuse me,

02:00:39.733 --> 02:00:43.658
old Boba Fett's gonna give this
squirrel a couple of nuts to hide.

02:00:44.279 --> 02:00:45.326
You know Boba Fett,

02:00:45.405 --> 02:00:47.765
he always fucked the space
squirrel at the end of the movie.

02:00:48.158 --> 02:00:51.412
Audience knew it was coming,
audience wanted it.

02:00:51.494 --> 02:00:52.916
Audience got it!

02:01:07.177 --> 02:01:10.681
<i>She's coming on to me
because she said</i>

02:01:10.764 --> 02:01:13.517
<i>I'm lonely Darling, please</i>

02:01:13.600 --> 02:01:17.650
<i>But instead of waiting,
I go flying off to you</i>

02:01:17.729 --> 02:01:21.029
<i>Why? Oh, well,
just because</i>

02:01:41.961 --> 02:01:45.386
<i>I arrive when you're gone,
so I wait at your door</i>

02:01:45.465 --> 02:01:48.890
<i>You pull up in some
guy's car around four</i>

02:01:48.968 --> 02:01:52.563
<i>I punch him, kiss
then carry you inside</i>

02:01:52.639 --> 02:01:55.518
<i>Why? Oh, well,
just because</i>

02:02:23.711 --> 02:02:26.555
<i>Oh, baby, do you
like me that way?</i>

02:02:27.131 --> 02:02:30.556
<i>There's something 'bout you
that makes me want to say</i>

02:02:30.635 --> 02:02:33.263
<i>I don't mind, I don't mind,
I don't mind</i>

02:02:34.097 --> 02:02:37.192
<i>Oh, baby, I like it that way</i>

02:02:37.684 --> 02:02:41.063
<i>She's coming home to me
because she said</i>

02:02:41.145 --> 02:02:44.069
<i>I'm lonely Darling, please</i>

02:02:44.148 --> 02:02:50.622
<i>But instead of waiting,
I go flying off to you</i>

02:02:54.117 --> 02:02:57.621
<i>Why? Well, just because</i>
