<i>New York is still here.</i>

00:27.094 --> 00:29.187
<i>We're here.</i>
<i>We're going to be here tomorrow.</i>

00:29.329 --> 00:30.591
<i>This is the way</i>
<i>of life people want.</i>

00:30.664 --> 00:34.259
<i>Democracy, the rule of law, people</i>
<i>treating each other decently...</i>

00:34.668 --> 00:37.762
<i>people caring about each other,</i>
<i>and we're gonna prevail.</i>

00:37.838 --> 00:41.604
<i>New York is gonna be here tomorrow</i>
<i>and it's gonna be here forever.</i>

00:41.975 --> 00:46.912
<i>And this is the way of life that</i>
<i>people want throughout the world.</i>

00:51.652 --> 00:52.744
Daddy's home!

00:52.986 --> 00:55.454
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

00:55.556 --> 00:56.682
What are you doing here?

00:56.957 --> 00:59.755
She's been dying to do that
for the past hour. Where were you?

00:59.826 --> 01:02.659
What's she doing still up? I had
some paper and the traffic is horrible.

01:02.763 --> 01:04.060
What are you doing
with the balloon?

01:04.131 --> 01:04.858
Heavy traffic.

01:05.966 --> 01:08.867
- Let us know next time.
- I will, I will.

01:09.303 --> 01:11.134
What are you doing? You're going
to go upstairs and brush your teeth?

01:12.806 --> 01:15.297
- Come on, go, go, go!
- Go. Get up there.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.836
- You're going to tuck me in?
- Yeah of course.

01:19.346 --> 01:20.779
I'm gonna check that toothbrush.

01:20.948 --> 01:22.609
Dad!

01:27.421 --> 01:28.979
So what,
they change her medication?

01:29.056 --> 01:32.492
The doctor says we'll keep trying
different ones until the seizures stop.

01:33.026 --> 01:34.687
That sounds like a genius plan.

01:36.029 --> 01:37.553
That's where she got
the balloon then?

01:38.265 --> 01:40.256
They're pretty nice in there.

01:41.234 --> 01:45.534
- Except that one idiot.
- Who? Dr. Sing?

01:45.939 --> 01:48.339
He talks to her like there's
something wrong with her.

01:49.242 --> 01:50.903
What are you talking about?
He talks to her like she's five.

01:50.978 --> 01:52.377
I can't stand him.
He's an asshole.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.407
He is...
I'm sorry, I just...

01:55.482 --> 01:59.111
I don't understand how they can
move you two hours away randomly.

01:59.486 --> 02:02.284
- It's ridiculous, you know it is.
- It's temporary, isn't it, Ker?

02:02.356 --> 02:03.823
- I don't care that it's temporary.
- Come on!

02:03.957 --> 02:05.957
'Quality of Life' it's a bunch
of shit and you know it.

02:05.958 --> 02:07.392
<i>Daddy, I brushed my teeth.</i>
<i>I'm going to bed.</i>

02:07.393 --> 02:08.883
Okay, I'm coming up right now.

02:09.696 --> 02:11.463
What do you want me to do?
I ain't got no seniority.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.626
- <i>Daddy! I brushed my teeth!</i>
- Gotta finish this now.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.065
<i>I run in bed!</i>

02:15.135 --> 02:16.500
Okay, baby,
I'm coming up. Hold on.

02:17.170 --> 02:19.536
I love you.
You stop it, okay?

02:24.111 --> 02:27.046
- Hey you!
- Hay is for horses.

02:27.781 --> 02:28.713
Yeah, it is.

02:31.385 --> 02:33.478
How did Charlie
run again, Daddy?

02:33.987 --> 02:35.978
How did Charlie run?
You know how Charlie ran.

02:42.863 --> 02:44.888
And Charlie
was a good dog, right?

02:44.965 --> 02:47.263
Yeah, what are you talking
about? He was the best.

02:48.769 --> 02:51.070
And that's why you
named me Charlie, right?

02:51.071 --> 02:53.062
Yeah. Psh.
We can't say that too loud.

02:53.874 --> 02:56.399
Mommy still thinks I named
you after Grandma Charlotte.

03:07.020 --> 03:07.645
Charlie?

03:09.456 --> 03:10.115
Charlie!

03:21.068 --> 03:21.864
You okay?

03:24.805 --> 03:25.430
Okay.

03:28.975 --> 03:29.771
You tired?

03:32.446 --> 03:33.037
Okay.

03:34.381 --> 03:37.475
You know all I ever dreamed about
was people like you and mommy.

03:47.094 --> 03:48.152
Good night, baby.

03:51.364 --> 03:53.491
And that's where
the castles were...

03:54.634 --> 03:55.498
right?

03:57.337 --> 03:59.805
- Where you grew up?
- That's right, baby.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.543
The giant castles.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.644
And they was as big as
the whole world?

04:12.586 --> 04:16.077
Okay, go to sleep.

04:21.762 --> 04:22.694
Good night, baby.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.295
<i>Milk! I want my gun!</i>

05:08.241 --> 05:11.277
I got the little motherfucker
down here in the apartment 1-C.

05:11.278 --> 05:13.576
A little Casper motherfucker.

05:13.647 --> 05:17.242
A little glow-in-the-dark motherfucker
that they call Milk. Milk!

05:17.317 --> 05:21.549
Little glow-in-the-dark Casper
motherfucker got my gun...

05:21.621 --> 05:25.523
and I'm gonna get my shit, Milk!
Where's my goddamn gun, Milk?

05:25.592 --> 05:28.356
Give me my goddamn gun.
Fuck you, Milk!

05:28.428 --> 05:30.988
Give me my gun!
Shit, you stole my gun.

05:41.775 --> 05:45.404
Where Milk at?
Where he at? Milk?

05:47.113 --> 05:50.674
You glow-in the-dark
Casper motherfucker!

05:56.089 --> 05:58.057
I want my shit!

05:59.793 --> 06:02.318
- Get the fuck out! Get out!
- Shut up!

06:02.395 --> 06:05.330
Get outta here, Hanky!
Go to your own fucking house!

06:12.772 --> 06:13.466
Vinny?

06:15.442 --> 06:16.643
Vinny!

06:33.860 --> 06:36.061
<i>Seeing it is, in person...</i>

06:36.062 --> 06:39.657
<i>is very different than seeing it</i> <i>on
television or seeing pictures of it.</i>

06:39.966 --> 06:44.403
<i>It gives you a sense of the devastation</i>
<i>that was accomplished there.</i>

06:55.982 --> 06:57.745
<i>Retiring Police Commissioner,</i>
<i>Charles Stanford...</i>

06:57.817 --> 07:00.285
<i>and his predicted successor,</i>
<i>Captain Marion Mathers...</i>

07:00.286 --> 07:01.982
<i>are coming under</i>
<i>continued scrutiny...</i>

07:02.088 --> 07:04.689
<i>of the Quality of Life raid here</i>
<i>at the Queensboro Projects...</i>

07:04.690 --> 07:06.224
<i>on Christmas Eve.</i>
<i>Locals are saying...</i>

07:06.225 --> 07:08.493
<i>this didn't have a whole</i>
<i>lot to do with safer streets.</i>

07:08.494 --> 07:10.429
<i>It had a lot more to do</i>
<i>with real estate.</i>

07:10.497 --> 07:14.033
<i>A deal to turn the coveted</i>
<i>waterfront property into condos.</i>

07:14.034 --> 07:14.898
I fucking live here!

07:15.635 --> 07:17.035
<i>Osama Bin Laden</i>
<i>and other terrorists...</i>

07:17.036 --> 07:18.004
<i>are still in hiding.</i>

07:18.071 --> 07:19.368
<i>Our message to them is clear.</i>

07:19.506 --> 07:20.996
<i>No matter how long it takes...</i>

07:21.274 --> 07:24.243
<i>America will find you</i>
<i>and we will bring you to justice.</i>

07:24.244 --> 07:27.805
- I fucking live here! We live here!
- You live here? We know that.

07:29.182 --> 07:37.954
All right, back up! Back up!

07:43.697 --> 07:45.265
Captain Mathers,
I talked to one woman...

07:45.266 --> 07:47.399
who said that the 118
isn't welcome here.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.800
You're causing trouble
by being here tonight.

07:48.801 --> 07:49.734
What we're doing...

07:49.735 --> 07:51.704
is we're making a dangerous
neighborhood safer.

07:51.771 --> 07:53.466
So that, the good citizens
who live here...

07:53.540 --> 07:55.235
<i>we want them</i>
<i>to enjoy their holidays.</i>

07:55.308 --> 07:58.072
- <i>They don't agree with you.</i>
- <i>Well, that's what we're doing.</i>

08:16.963 --> 08:17.952
I'm a cop.

08:19.766 --> 08:20.357
Fuck.

08:26.306 --> 08:28.638
Twenty in, twenty right out.
Johnny.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.313
Twenty in twenty out,
twenty in, twenty out...

08:35.315 --> 08:37.078
that's what I fucking
tell myself every day.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.618
Twenty in, twenty out,
twenty in, twenty out...

08:39.686 --> 08:41.950
twenty in, twenty out,
twenty in, twenty out.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.622
Jesus, you're
a fucking rookie at 30?

08:45.025 --> 08:47.459
Shit. My 30th birthday...

08:47.460 --> 08:48.950
I was halfway to retirement.

08:49.996 --> 08:53.295
So you just spent your fucking
twentys, having fun, being free.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.833
Bullshit. Eating pussy.

08:55.835 --> 08:58.360
You've ask me this every day,
since I've transferred here.

08:58.471 --> 08:59.062
Yep.

09:00.607 --> 09:04.805
You know record shop, 7-11 's,
they're not that exciting.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.311
Fuck excitement.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.075
You know, I feel bad
for you, old man.

09:09.482 --> 09:12.885
One day, you're fucking pulling
over these hot Italian chicks...

09:12.886 --> 09:14.080
the next with this shit?

09:14.921 --> 09:18.652
Fuck.
Everybody hates America.

09:19.225 --> 09:22.285
Meanwhile, what the fuck is anyone
else doing for the rest of the world?

09:26.900 --> 09:28.731
Where's my money?
You got my money?

09:30.470 --> 09:34.531
<i>She's Olive Oyl.</i>
<i>Pick that stink bitch up.</i>

09:34.674 --> 09:37.609
- <i>See you two at the precinct.</i>
- You got it.

09:43.149 --> 09:45.117
Olive? Hey, Olive.

09:53.693 --> 09:57.652
- Take that son of a bitch in!
- All right, all right.

09:59.699 --> 10:03.635
- Come on, get in the car. Get in.
- You're going to the car. Get in.

10:03.703 --> 10:06.371
Right after you,
you bonny-assed motherfucker!

10:06.372 --> 10:07.031
Shut up.

10:08.174 --> 10:08.902
Fuck you!

10:10.243 --> 10:12.268
You're gonna
fucking regret that later.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.248
What are you doing?
Get outta here!

10:16.316 --> 10:17.340
I'm looking.
I'm looking.

10:17.484 --> 10:20.452
What are you, retarded?
What are you doing? Fuck!

10:20.453 --> 10:22.148
You call people retarded?

10:23.323 --> 10:24.722
Get outta here!

10:26.392 --> 10:29.020
Thanks for coming to work
today, Mom. I appreciate it.

10:29.095 --> 10:30.392
- Shut up!
- Stop it!

10:56.890 --> 11:00.121
All right, all right. You know what?
Keep them separated.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.423
Look who's here.
Olive!

11:02.495 --> 11:04.730
- Got your Sunday best on?
- Go fuck yourself.

11:04.731 --> 11:06.699
Not over here.
Not over here!

11:07.133 --> 11:09.499
Are you going flying today,
Martinez? Look at you.

11:09.569 --> 11:12.197
It smells like he flew out
of somebody's ass, Cap.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.174
You going flying?
Look at him.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.508
Go to hell!

11:16.509 --> 11:19.706
Easy, Olive. What about you?
Do you mind the smell?

11:19.879 --> 11:21.005
I don't know.
I mean, I'd rather not.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.247
You know what we'd rather
not do is smell like shit...

11:23.248 --> 11:24.549
when we go home
to our wives.

11:24.550 --> 11:26.719
When the old man steps down,
you can beat out of anybody you want.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.619
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!

11:31.024 --> 11:33.618
Yeah, get him.

11:35.962 --> 11:38.497
All right, all right.

11:38.498 --> 11:40.489
Get off me! Fuck you!

11:41.401 --> 11:43.460
Sit down.
Sit down.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.071
- Way to go, Olive.
- Fuck you!

11:46.139 --> 11:47.538
How'd you get
the weekends off?

11:48.274 --> 11:50.504
Just told them I wasn't
gonna transfer here without it.

11:52.011 --> 11:56.072
Man, Mathers must have
wanted you pretty bad.

11:57.317 --> 12:00.946
All right.
I'll see you on Monday.

12:01.654 --> 12:02.416
Yeah, man.

12:02.488 --> 12:05.889
Listen, think of me
from your 7/11's and shit.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.524
And Mathers said
to look at that shit!

12:27.447 --> 12:29.180
The city's in
an elevated Code Yellow...

12:29.181 --> 12:30.650
and this fucker
we should be looking...

12:30.651 --> 12:33.252
into some unsolved shit
from 16 years ago.

12:33.253 --> 12:36.620
- Excuse me, sir?
- What, are you in the Army?

12:37.423 --> 12:39.687
No, no, I'm just...

12:41.394 --> 12:43.328
Fucker can't even
sign his own name.

12:46.699 --> 12:49.031
It's the third month in a row.

12:51.004 --> 12:52.733
This reporter's making
a career out of it.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.468
It's the first I heard of it.

12:58.311 --> 13:00.074
Now that you're here,
you should be aware of it.

13:30.109 --> 13:33.979
I didn't even want this.
I told him to stop coming to me.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.311
This is where I live.

13:49.595 --> 13:50.892
This is where I live!

13:50.963 --> 13:54.199
<i>I got the little motherfucker</i>
<i>down here in apartment number 1-C.</i>

13:54.200 --> 13:55.895
This is where live!

14:08.214 --> 14:11.809
Grandmother, she's an old lady.
He takes the checks and...

14:13.119 --> 14:14.677
I thought he was gonna kill me.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.821
I thought he
was gonna kill me.

14:27.066 --> 14:31.833
My grandmother does nothing! She's
an old lady. She doesn't do anything!

14:37.643 --> 14:40.111
Shit! Pretend you're
taking a shit or something.

14:41.047 --> 14:43.180
You can't even knock? You just
walk in people's houses and shit?

14:43.181 --> 14:44.550
Listen, teenager.
I got to take a shit.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.348
I'll take a shit right here,
right now. Outta my way.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.217
What the fuck!

14:59.966 --> 15:01.934
What kind
of fucking butcher shop?

15:53.653 --> 15:54.984
<i>He comes every day.</i>

15:55.455 --> 15:58.423
He takes the checks
from the mailbox...

15:58.424 --> 16:01.621
right from the mailbox.
And she doesn't do anything.

16:01.694 --> 16:03.596
I just didn't want him
to come here any more.

16:03.597 --> 16:07.157
I saw when Louie died.
Cops were all laughing.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.302
I thought he was gonna kill me.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.634
We'll throw him in the garbage.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.865
- He got a bullet in him, Vin.
- Shut the fuck, I don't care.

16:14.006 --> 16:16.804
We're gonna throw his ass
in the garbage. No one gives a shit.

16:20.646 --> 16:25.106
Yeah, the cops don't care.
No one does.

16:25.351 --> 16:28.684
Yeah, trust me,
No one gives a shit.

17:33.819 --> 17:34.751
Hey, baby.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.790
Did Charlie run, Daddy?

17:45.064 --> 17:46.326
He ran like this.

17:53.172 --> 17:56.300
And he loved to hang
in the giant castle?

17:57.209 --> 17:59.734
That's right,
in the giant castles.

18:01.881 --> 18:02.905
Okay, night.

18:22.501 --> 18:23.900
<i>You liked the circus, baby?</i>

18:25.338 --> 18:27.067
<i>Of course she liked the circus.</i>

18:28.441 --> 18:29.999
<i>I loved the circus.</i>

18:31.811 --> 18:33.938
<i>Loved the circus!</i>

18:55.067 --> 18:58.195
I'm gonna stop by the precinct.
I left my cell phone there.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.905
And then we're gonna
watch Sponge Bob, right?

19:00.973 --> 19:03.408
No secrets!
You were whispering!

19:03.409 --> 19:05.309
Daddy was just saying
this is where he grew up.

19:05.444 --> 19:08.106
Did you know that?
In one of these buildings.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.379
The giant castles.

19:27.199 --> 19:27.790
Come on.

19:39.912 --> 19:42.278
Nice hip pack.

19:42.715 --> 19:45.650
Family outing at the 118, man.
You ran out of shit to do on the island?

19:45.718 --> 19:47.686
We came in from the city.
We went to the circus.

19:47.753 --> 19:49.321
- This is Kerry.
- Hi, yeah, Kerry and Charlotte.

19:49.322 --> 19:53.121
- Hi, did you see some lions?
- Charlie loves the lions, right?

19:53.192 --> 19:55.727
- Everybody loves lions, man.
- Come here.

19:55.728 --> 19:58.390
You're bringing two pretty ladies
up in this shithole? What's up?

19:58.464 --> 19:59.830
You can sit right here, okay?

19:59.831 --> 20:01.832
I'm gonna be right back. I'm gonna
get my cell phone out of my locker.

20:01.833 --> 20:04.101
All right, man. I'll be up here.
I'm taking care of them.

20:04.102 --> 20:05.127
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

20:39.071 --> 20:39.765
Char?

20:41.207 --> 20:43.505
- What are you doing?
- We were playing with the breathalyzer.

20:43.876 --> 20:46.312
Stop it. This stuff's filthy.
You don't touch this stuff around here.

20:46.313 --> 20:49.304
- We were just fucking around here.
- Really? You don't know that well.

20:49.815 --> 20:52.477
- You understand?
- Really?

20:55.988 --> 20:56.920
Kerry, come on.

20:57.389 --> 20:58.014
Really?

20:59.792 --> 21:00.588
Come on, baby.

21:03.195 --> 21:04.321
There she goes.

21:06.565 --> 21:08.533
Have a safe trip
back to the island.

21:33.025 --> 21:36.791
<i>It's a desire and a chance to react</i>
<i>under certain circumstances.</i>

21:36.862 --> 21:39.126
<i>The economy reacted,</i>
<i>the stock market too.</i>

21:39.498 --> 21:41.431
<i>New York is on track to a rebound.</i>

21:41.432 --> 21:43.924
<i>It's just a year</i>
<i>after many have said...</i>

21:44.003 --> 21:48.337
<i>that a city like New York</i>
<i>couldn't bounce back</i>

21:48.407 --> 21:50.375
<i>And see what happened</i>
<i>to the market.</i>

21:50.976 --> 21:53.240
<i>This boy, Milk,</i>
<i>done took my gun.</i>

22:06.392 --> 22:07.859
<i>You get a murder on Whitestone.</i>

22:07.927 --> 22:08.916
<i>The kids are crying. You know?</i>

22:09.929 --> 22:12.830
<i>Parents givin' 'em</i>
<i>days off of school.</i>

22:14.567 --> 22:18.059
<i>The children here are different.</i>

22:37.857 --> 22:39.256
You see them from your window?

22:44.396 --> 22:47.297
Don't worry. They'll do their
shit and then they'll leave.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.065
We just can't say nothing.

22:51.503 --> 22:52.492
I gotta go.

22:53.172 --> 22:54.969
You better not say
nothing, Vicky!

22:56.876 --> 23:00.039
- Everybody's freaking out now.
- I know.

23:00.312 --> 23:01.802
But I gotta get home.

23:02.014 --> 23:04.107
Please, just chill.

23:04.683 --> 23:06.344
My mother's boyfriend is here...

23:06.452 --> 23:07.680
and I don't wanna deal
with that.

23:07.753 --> 23:08.988
He got a bullet in him, Vin.

23:08.989 --> 23:11.650
I know that.
You don't think I know that?

23:12.491 --> 23:17.087
- What do you want me to do?
- Just I gotta go home.

23:17.596 --> 23:19.154
I'm serious.
What do you want me to do?

23:19.231 --> 23:20.960
I don't know!
I'm going home.

23:30.075 --> 23:33.611
Jonathan, your grandma
took the dog out.

23:33.612 --> 23:35.671
So I was here just
looking at an old picture.

23:37.483 --> 23:39.849
And I thought maybe you
and I could talk for a minute.

23:41.186 --> 23:45.748
How about we go outside?
Nice day today.

23:45.958 --> 23:47.226
Just you and me...

23:47.227 --> 23:50.457
sit somewhere, just talk
a little bit. Is that all right?

23:51.797 --> 23:54.960
It'll be fine. It'll be fine.

24:12.451 --> 24:15.420
You seem a little
shook up, Jonathan.

24:16.188 --> 24:17.280
A reason for that?

24:27.800 --> 24:29.700
It ain't easy
growing up around here.

24:30.869 --> 24:34.100
I could imagine,
especially without a father.

24:34.606 --> 24:37.632
He was a good man.

24:39.144 --> 24:39.974
Your father.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.855
You know why I brought you
out here though, don't you?

24:57.429 --> 25:00.489
With all of them
looking at us wondering...

25:00.766 --> 25:06.404
what's Detective Charlie,
white Officer Charlie...

25:06.405 --> 25:09.397
doing talking
with little white Jonathan?

25:09.475 --> 25:10.908
What are they talking about?

25:12.511 --> 25:16.381
And a few of them are particularly
concerned about some dead junkie...

25:16.382 --> 25:19.249
last seen going through your door...

25:19.518 --> 25:24.478
and then winding up about
twenty feet from that same door.

25:26.492 --> 25:29.893
You don't know why?

25:43.409 --> 25:45.809
You're a deer in the jungle here,
my boy.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.206
And that fellow, Hanky...

25:49.314 --> 25:52.477
he wasn't worth
two damn cents, Milk.

25:54.787 --> 25:57.119
Yeah, that's what
they call you, right? Milk?

26:00.726 --> 26:02.523
I'm just talking.
It's over.

26:03.328 --> 26:10.700
You can go. But you hear anything,
you come talk to Officer Charlie.

26:11.770 --> 26:12.429
Okay.

26:17.209 --> 26:18.767
Good seeing you Jonathan!

26:33.826 --> 26:34.758
Charlie?

26:53.645 --> 26:57.012
Someone can tell me sitting
in my hallway is a fucking crime?

26:57.082 --> 26:58.784
Fuck you outta here!
Fuck that shit!

26:58.785 --> 27:01.184
Fuck you!
Fuck that shit, motherfucker!

27:05.157 --> 27:07.990
White, Prudenti! Come here.
Let's take a walk. Outside.

27:09.228 --> 27:11.560
Olive Oyl, you look beautiful,
sweetheart.

27:15.367 --> 27:17.062
Fucking asylum in there.

27:18.904 --> 27:20.132
Jesus... Look.

27:20.205 --> 27:23.732
I need you go over to the Gazette's
offices, over there by Ditmars.

27:23.809 --> 27:25.140
I want you to talk
to the writer.

27:25.210 --> 27:28.111
Tell her she's not hunting
the fucking Son of Sam here, right?

27:28.180 --> 27:31.549
Tell her we're fighting a war on terror
in this fucking city already.

27:31.550 --> 27:33.142
- No problem.
- Here, you take this.

27:33.519 --> 27:36.721
Handle it.

27:36.722 --> 27:37.523
Last thing we need...

27:37.524 --> 27:41.425
is them demanding we reopen
some case 16 years ago.

27:41.760 --> 27:43.523
None of us want that,
I imagine.

27:44.563 --> 27:46.394
No. All right. Let's go.

27:46.465 --> 27:47.489
- Just be safe.
- Okay.

27:49.234 --> 27:50.826
Tell her to cut the shit.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.384
I watched him die
in the heat of the sun.

28:12.658 --> 28:15.525
Sucking up bullets
of a policeman's gun.

28:15.594 --> 28:18.688
"Police at the 118 know."
Listen to this fuck.

28:18.764 --> 28:20.493
But Mathers said
it's bullshit though, right?

28:20.566 --> 28:21.624
Yeah, it's all bullshit.

28:21.934 --> 28:24.027
If he was a man, he would have
signed his fucking name though.

28:46.525 --> 28:48.186
God...

28:48.560 --> 28:50.960
- Ms. Bridges?
- Lauren Bridges.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.629
Like London bridges, right?

28:52.931 --> 28:54.262
Just like that.

28:54.933 --> 28:57.163
I know who you are.
Officer Prudenti.

28:58.136 --> 28:59.000
Yeah, that's right.

28:59.871 --> 29:02.101
- You're new?
- Yes, madam. Jonathan White.

29:02.307 --> 29:03.331
Pleased to meet you.

29:03.976 --> 29:06.206
- Look at this.
- You like that?

29:06.278 --> 29:08.379
Yeah, I do.
Look at these fucking assholes.

29:08.380 --> 29:10.881
So Marion sent you.
I understand why you're here.

29:10.882 --> 29:12.008
Captain Marion?

29:12.084 --> 29:13.619
All I can say, as far as me
not printing them...

29:13.620 --> 29:15.382
you came to the wrong person.

29:15.454 --> 29:17.820
- We'd like to see the letters.
- Of course.

29:21.159 --> 29:23.593
Tampered evidence
is wasted evidence.

29:23.662 --> 29:28.031
You realize it's not actually evidence
until somebody gives a fuck about this.

29:31.136 --> 29:33.195
- Are there any more?
- Only three.

29:33.905 --> 29:35.839
Here on, the minute
they come in, I print them.

29:35.907 --> 29:37.033
Like doughnuts, right?

29:39.811 --> 29:42.746
I'd appreciate you stop
touching my shit. Thank you.

29:42.814 --> 29:43.644
I'm sorry.

29:44.683 --> 29:47.015
So I called Marion
after I received them...

29:47.919 --> 29:49.079
and he couldn't give a damn.

29:50.322 --> 29:52.257
Seems no one's interested
in the possibility...

29:52.258 --> 29:56.591
of police doing anything corrupt,
since this whole 9/11 debacle.

29:56.728 --> 29:59.128
You must feel
like a real reporter then.

29:59.898 --> 30:02.389
We have
a circulation of over 100,000.

30:02.534 --> 30:04.770
You can tell me the last time
that many people...

30:04.771 --> 30:06.499
knew a cop for a good reason?

30:06.571 --> 30:10.632
Look, if you get another letter,
why don't you give us a call?

30:11.810 --> 30:15.246
Officer, you do know
the hero tide will turn?

30:15.647 --> 30:18.349
- My cell is on the back.
- Of course, you know no one...

30:18.350 --> 30:20.341
stays loved
in New York for long.

30:27.426 --> 30:28.222
What do you think?

30:28.293 --> 30:30.158
What do I think?
I think she's a dyke.

31:04.162 --> 31:04.719
Hello?

31:09.634 --> 31:10.191
Milk?

31:12.771 --> 31:13.931
<i>Please, don't hang up.</i>

31:16.341 --> 31:19.538
You know, I would never
do any of that stuff.

31:21.313 --> 31:23.508
Vin, I didn't see
anything anyways.

31:32.324 --> 31:35.725
<i>Do nothing. I swear.</i>
<i>I swear I wasn't gonna do nothing.</i>

31:35.794 --> 31:36.993
<i>He just said,</i>
<i>if I didn't...</i>

31:36.994 --> 31:38.860
<i>he'd tell my mother</i>
<i>to put me back in the hospital.</i>

31:38.930 --> 31:40.530
And if they put me back
in that hospital...

31:40.531 --> 31:42.466
I can't do anything,
if anything happens to you.

31:42.534 --> 31:43.592
I can do nothing.

31:45.771 --> 31:47.295
What are you
talking about, Vin?

31:56.615 --> 32:00.073
You don't think I'm a faggot,
Milk, I'm not a faggot right?

32:00.152 --> 32:00.777
<i>No.</i>

32:11.396 --> 32:14.888
<i>You're the only fucking person</i>
<i>in this whole world I can trust.</i>

32:15.000 --> 32:17.969
<i>I hate it.</i>
<i>I hate it here so fucking much.</i>

32:18.737 --> 32:20.227
<i>I fucking hate it here.</i>

32:21.673 --> 32:22.503
Me too.

32:34.986 --> 32:36.010
<i>Listen, Milk.</i>

32:36.555 --> 32:38.386
<i>In my mother's</i>
<i>boyfriend's apartment...</i>

32:39.057 --> 32:41.355
he has a thousand dollars.

32:42.160 --> 32:44.462
I saw it, Milk.
A thousand dollars.

32:44.463 --> 32:47.364
<i>That's a lot of money.</i>
<i>I got the key.</i>

32:49.568 --> 32:52.002
I got the key to his apartment.
I can go in.

32:52.003 --> 32:54.767
I can find it, Milk.
I know where it is. I saw it.

32:57.342 --> 33:01.472
I can take it. And, man,
we can get outta here, Milk.

33:02.547 --> 33:03.741
<i>We can get outta here.</i>

33:05.484 --> 33:06.314
Okay.

33:20.665 --> 33:21.791
What's up, Milk?

33:26.304 --> 33:28.135
You kids are cold-blooded.

33:29.274 --> 33:33.074
Killing junkies, partying
and shit afterwards.

33:34.246 --> 33:34.946
Vinny up there...

33:34.947 --> 33:36.846
sucking his mama
boyfriend dick.

33:37.616 --> 33:38.981
Fuck is that about?

33:41.586 --> 33:43.884
Hanky OD'd in my apartment.

33:44.856 --> 33:45.948
OD'd?

33:47.392 --> 33:51.055
Fucker jumped in the bathtub
for one last bath.

33:53.231 --> 33:57.258
Gun went off.
I could see that.

33:59.871 --> 34:03.705
Anyway,
Hanky was a no-good junkie.

34:07.212 --> 34:10.612
Junkie with a $300 tab
and a gun like this.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.018
When I'm putting
the pieces together...

34:15.620 --> 34:17.884
pieces of a fucking murder.

34:23.094 --> 34:25.562
Somebody, definitely,
killed Hanky...

34:28.166 --> 34:29.063
except me.

34:30.135 --> 34:34.435
I'm not going to the cops.
They could give two shits about me.

34:35.639 --> 34:38.130
I just want the $300
he owed me.

34:41.313 --> 34:42.405
Listen, little man.

34:44.282 --> 34:48.878
I want $300 or I'm gonna go
to the cops with this.

34:52.424 --> 34:54.824
This shit still smell
like firecracker.

35:02.567 --> 35:04.034
Get your ass inside.

35:39.771 --> 35:42.604
What's going on?
Johnny?

35:43.508 --> 35:44.839
Sorry I'm late, Ker.

35:48.747 --> 35:50.305
What's going on for real?

35:53.618 --> 35:54.414
What do you mean?

36:01.960 --> 36:03.086
Is there someone else?

36:07.866 --> 36:08.855
Are you kidding me?

36:10.835 --> 36:13.065
I met you when you were
working in a record shop.

36:13.171 --> 36:15.867
You take this ridiculous
police test...

36:15.940 --> 36:19.000
because you're going to be right down
the street. Now you're two hours away...

36:19.077 --> 36:20.544
and you're in no rush
to get home.

36:20.612 --> 36:21.806
It's temporary, Kerr.

36:23.214 --> 36:24.875
Then why are you
getting home so late?

36:29.320 --> 36:32.414
I just can't believe I ended up
at my father's old precinct.

36:35.960 --> 36:37.757
I just can't believe
I ended up there.

36:41.533 --> 36:42.431
I'm sorry.

36:47.639 --> 36:50.472
I keep going by my old address
and I just look at it.

36:55.714 --> 36:56.510
Who's there?

36:59.851 --> 37:00.647
No one.

37:05.156 --> 37:06.282
No one any more.

37:14.265 --> 37:14.856
White?

37:19.070 --> 37:19.661
White...

37:21.239 --> 37:23.341
I don't need to tell you
like I've been telling Prudenti...

37:23.342 --> 37:25.571
which I'm sure you both
already know this.

37:25.710 --> 37:27.200
But for the sake of clarity...

37:27.679 --> 37:30.681
someone went in and tore the Gazette's
offices to shreds last night...

37:30.682 --> 37:31.979
about 11 p.m.

37:33.251 --> 37:37.779
I know Bridges for 15 years.
15 years I've known her.

37:38.256 --> 37:39.587
She's relentless.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.226
- Listen, Captain...
- No, you listen.

37:43.094 --> 37:46.222
I don't give a shit who did this.
You know why?

37:46.297 --> 37:49.960
Because I don't. But what I do
need is you both to go over there...

37:50.101 --> 37:52.262
and tell her
that whoever did this...

37:52.537 --> 37:55.870
is gonna be a top priority
on our list, whatever, anything.

37:56.674 --> 37:57.402
Okay?

37:59.744 --> 38:00.904
And go on.

38:18.196 --> 38:20.357
Ms. Bridges. I'm...

38:22.100 --> 38:24.625
You came to have a good look
at the work you'd done?

38:24.836 --> 38:27.964
I can assure you that we didn't
have anything to do with this.

38:28.039 --> 38:31.475
You know every mafia wannabe
who grew up here became a cop?

38:31.743 --> 38:35.279
Big facades with your hero
9/11 charity events. Fuck this!

38:35.280 --> 38:37.612
If I understood a fucking
word you just said...

38:37.682 --> 38:38.449
I'm sure I'd have a comeback.

38:38.450 --> 38:41.351
I can have a car come around
maybe a few extra times at night...

38:41.352 --> 38:42.220
Are you sure that wasn't...

38:42.221 --> 38:43.915
your captain's request last night?

38:44.656 --> 38:46.146
Fuck her, let's go.

38:46.558 --> 38:47.792
Goddamn frat boy.

38:47.793 --> 38:51.922
Just contact me directly,
if you have any more problems.

38:52.564 --> 38:53.394
I have one.

38:53.865 --> 38:56.732
It'll be the cover of our
next issue. Yeah, really.

39:00.004 --> 39:02.131
You know what
a Mucky Pup is, Officer?

39:03.474 --> 39:05.032
It's the son of a copper.

39:09.013 --> 39:12.414
You? You look like
the son of no one.

39:15.286 --> 39:17.846
But you were the son
of Stanford's old partner.

39:21.559 --> 39:22.821
You have my card.

39:26.598 --> 39:27.929
Did she say
anything else in there?

39:28.499 --> 39:30.364
Just that she won't stop
printing these letters...

39:30.435 --> 39:31.766
and her place got tore up.

39:32.170 --> 39:33.467
Diesel bitch.

39:34.172 --> 39:35.907
Probably did it herself
looking for a story.

39:35.908 --> 39:37.966
And still no one gives
a fuck out those letters.

39:38.309 --> 39:39.333
Except for us.

39:41.446 --> 39:42.242
Except you.

40:01.165 --> 40:04.760
- You came here with that dog?
- I want him to come with us.

40:08.072 --> 40:11.337
- They won't let him come.
- Who won't?

40:12.877 --> 40:14.367
We don't even know
where we're going.

40:16.814 --> 40:19.182
Just, just tie him up.
Just tie him up.

40:19.183 --> 40:22.516
I just gotta get in this
guy's then we can go.

40:23.454 --> 40:25.319
It's under the couch.
Let's just get it and go.

40:26.257 --> 40:29.124
- You have the key?
- It's, it's right here.

40:35.033 --> 40:36.796
We're just gonna get it
and then go.

40:37.001 --> 40:37.865
In and out.

40:48.947 --> 40:50.005
Just close the door.

40:55.620 --> 40:56.951
Charlie, stay quiet.

40:58.623 --> 40:59.783
Just gotta get it and go.

40:59.857 --> 41:01.722
Keep quiet. Stay quiet.

41:08.599 --> 41:09.793
Shut that dog up!

41:20.078 --> 41:21.705
Fuck ya'll doing in here?

41:21.779 --> 41:24.014
- Nothing.
- What you two doing in here?

41:24.015 --> 41:26.916
What's going on in there?

41:32.490 --> 41:34.720
Charlie, stop!
Charlie, stop!

41:37.328 --> 41:40.024
Get this motherfucker. Shut
this dog. You hearing me, man?

41:40.098 --> 41:42.599
- Charlie, stop! Charlie, stop!
- Piece of shit!

41:42.600 --> 41:45.068
Stop that!

42:06.124 --> 42:07.819
Charlie...

42:11.095 --> 42:12.187
Charlie?

42:14.832 --> 42:16.060
Vinny!

42:28.946 --> 42:29.810
Shit.

42:30.348 --> 42:31.110
Hello?

42:32.717 --> 42:34.810
<i>Sounds like</i>
<i>your baby's crying.</i>

42:37.722 --> 42:38.518
Who is this?

42:39.991 --> 42:41.219
<i>What's the problem?</i>

42:41.559 --> 42:43.322
<i>She doesn't like</i>
<i>her new medication?</i>

42:43.428 --> 42:44.417
Who is this?

42:45.430 --> 42:47.193
<i>When your husband</i>
<i>gets home tonight...</i>

42:48.032 --> 42:51.263
<i>ask him about</i>
<i>two murders in 1986.</i>

43:00.111 --> 43:02.602
It's okay. It's okay.
Here, it's okay.

43:04.549 --> 43:07.313
I'm not...
Keep your feet up.

43:17.395 --> 43:18.487
<i>Precinct 118.</i>

43:18.796 --> 43:20.024
Officer White, please.

43:20.098 --> 43:21.326
<i>Sure. Hold on.</i>

43:22.033 --> 43:24.524
White!
You got a call on line one.

43:25.002 --> 43:26.162
This came for you, too.

43:26.871 --> 43:27.565
Thank you.

43:29.507 --> 43:30.064
Hello?

43:30.174 --> 43:31.407
<i>Jonathan,</i>
<i>I just got a weird call.</i>

43:31.408 --> 43:31.932
What?

43:32.844 --> 43:34.245
<i>It was really fucked up.</i>

43:34.246 --> 43:37.112
Kerry, I can't hear you.
Is Charlie all right?

43:37.515 --> 43:39.142
<i>Where are you?</i>
<i>I need you to come home.</i>

43:39.217 --> 43:41.708
No, I can't hear you.

43:43.855 --> 43:47.222
<i>I got a really weird call</i>
<i>and I need you.</i>

43:48.626 --> 43:50.753
I'm gonna call you back
from my cell outside.

43:54.298 --> 43:55.128
Jonathan!

43:58.069 --> 43:59.934
What the fuck are you calling?
Are you kidding me?

44:01.839 --> 44:03.674
I'm telling you
need to shut the fuck up...

44:03.675 --> 44:06.234
you fucking Puerto
Rican piece of shit. It's fine.

44:06.310 --> 44:09.546
- I'm Dominican, motherfucker.
- I'm sorry, he's Dominican!

44:09.547 --> 44:11.606
You don't want this, man.
Get the fuck down.

44:11.682 --> 44:13.084
- I don't want this. I don't want this!
- Put it down.

44:13.085 --> 44:15.752
- Put it down, right fucking now.
- This motherfucker though.

44:15.753 --> 44:17.520
Relax. I swear to God,
I'm gonna put one in your head!

44:17.521 --> 44:18.988
He's calling it like bullshit.

44:18.989 --> 44:20.651
- Just put that gun down. Put it down.
- I don't wanna do this!

44:20.892 --> 44:22.883
I'm gonna put a fucking
bullet right in your head.

44:23.461 --> 44:25.895
- Relax!
- I don't want this!

44:27.131 --> 44:29.224
- I'm just trying to live.
- Come on.

44:29.433 --> 44:31.663
I don't want this. I don't want this.
I don't want this.

44:34.205 --> 44:35.729
Take him
in the fucking bathroom!

44:39.911 --> 44:41.469
What the fuck is going on?

44:41.546 --> 44:43.309
Motherfucker took
my fucking gun!

44:43.381 --> 44:44.882
So what are you're
bringing him to the bathroom?

44:44.883 --> 44:46.509
We are in the fucking '80s?

44:47.785 --> 44:49.719
Cameras all over
the place here.

44:49.820 --> 44:52.186
What's the matter with you?
Get this piece of shit up.

44:52.790 --> 44:55.156
Bring him over to the desk,
rear cuff him.

44:59.297 --> 45:02.164
People wonder why we pump
40 bullets in these fuckers.

45:03.734 --> 45:04.723
<i>Forty one!</i>

45:09.840 --> 45:12.331
I got half the city watching
my every fucking move...

45:12.443 --> 45:15.435
and this asshole can't control
himself in his own precinct.

45:16.981 --> 45:17.845
Look at him.

45:18.749 --> 45:20.148
Look at him.
He thinks it's funny.

45:21.052 --> 45:22.883
- I think it's funny.
- Look at him.

45:24.055 --> 45:27.354
Yeah, he's laughing.
It's like you're retarded.

45:29.927 --> 45:31.326
Un-fucking-believable.

45:42.206 --> 45:43.867
Let me ask you
something, Jonathan.

45:44.976 --> 45:46.273
When you were out there...

45:47.378 --> 45:49.938
did you feel like shooting
that piece of shit Puerto Rican?

45:50.915 --> 45:52.405
Putting two in his head?

45:53.918 --> 45:57.319
- Probably not the best idea.
- Why? Why is that?

45:59.390 --> 46:02.985
We'd have your back.
It's important that you know that.

46:05.096 --> 46:06.464
It's important
that you understand...

46:06.465 --> 46:08.989
that that's not going above
and beyond the call of duty.

46:11.369 --> 46:12.563
It's doing your job.

46:13.037 --> 46:14.004
It's our job.

46:15.239 --> 46:16.171
It's what we do.

46:21.379 --> 46:23.779
- Okay. Answer that.
- Sorry.

46:24.949 --> 46:28.385
You take the night off.
You saved a cop's life today.

46:29.754 --> 46:31.551
Even if he is an asshole.

46:43.601 --> 46:44.192
Kerry?

46:45.303 --> 46:49.000
<i>Why aren't you answering your phone?</i>
<i>I got a call.</i>

46:50.808 --> 46:53.641
<i>He told me to ask you</i>
<i>about two murders in 1986.</i>

46:55.579 --> 46:57.513
What the fuck
is going on, Johnny?

47:16.000 --> 47:17.433
They don't know anything, Jim.

47:18.069 --> 47:19.502
They don't know
nothing about this.

47:26.010 --> 47:26.874
This is life.

47:28.112 --> 47:30.613
Everything you, you want
or care about in this world...

47:30.614 --> 47:32.673
it ends up nowhere, right?

47:37.254 --> 47:39.814
My mom says she's gonna
put me back in the hospital.

47:41.692 --> 47:44.024
It's like they're always
trying to get rid of me or something.

47:47.832 --> 47:51.700
But when I get out,
I'm gonna get a job.

47:52.503 --> 47:54.698
I'm gonna get enough money
to get an apartment...

47:55.773 --> 47:57.263
and we're gonna be okay.

47:59.443 --> 48:00.740
You're gonna be okay, Milk.

48:02.380 --> 48:03.870
As long as we don't say nothing.

48:05.082 --> 48:06.481
And I never will.

48:08.185 --> 48:09.482
I never will.

48:11.756 --> 48:12.450
Vinny.

48:53.964 --> 48:54.692
<i>Hello?</i>

48:55.599 --> 48:59.763
<i>Ms. Carter? I was friends</i>
<i>with Vincent a long time ago.</i>

49:01.005 --> 49:02.836
I lived downstairs.
Milk.

49:12.383 --> 49:13.850
<i>I was here to see Vinny.</i>

49:15.119 --> 49:19.317
Jonathan! It's so nice
to see you. Look at you.

49:19.824 --> 49:22.192
You look like you're
doing well with yourself.

49:22.193 --> 49:22.852
Vicky?

49:26.297 --> 49:29.198
- <i>You here for Vinny?</i>
- <i>Yes, is he here?</i>

49:30.134 --> 49:33.160
Vincent's not
the same boy you knew.

49:33.404 --> 49:36.771
He is still my boy,
but he's not the one you knew.

49:39.877 --> 49:41.742
<i>I'm just gonna check up</i>
<i>on the roof real quick.</i>

49:41.812 --> 49:43.712
<i>Jonathan, please</i>
<i>don't go up there.</i>

49:44.048 --> 49:46.312
The past bothers
Vincent a lot.

49:49.320 --> 49:50.685
<i>Jonathan, please!</i>

50:20.751 --> 50:21.410
Hey, Vinny.

50:25.789 --> 50:26.619
Hey man.

50:35.199 --> 50:35.927
It's me...

50:38.869 --> 50:39.893
It's Jonathan.

50:43.607 --> 50:46.838
Milk. My man, Milk.

50:49.547 --> 50:53.005
Milk, my little man.

50:55.553 --> 50:56.611
What's up, Milk?

51:01.225 --> 51:02.317
Been a long time.

51:09.533 --> 51:10.397
Yes, Milk.

51:22.079 --> 51:24.104
Someone's calling
my house, Vinny.

51:28.085 --> 51:29.712
Someone's
calling my house.

51:35.125 --> 51:36.786
Yeah, he's talking to my wife.

51:45.202 --> 51:46.464
He's calling my...

51:50.074 --> 51:52.167
I always knew you
was gonna be good.

51:54.178 --> 51:56.738
I always knew it.

51:59.450 --> 52:00.517
I always knew it.

52:00.518 --> 52:04.044
- I know, man, but you got...
- I think I should go.

52:04.121 --> 52:05.754
If you're writing
letters, you gotta listen.

52:05.755 --> 52:06.955
You're not hearing me.

52:06.956 --> 52:09.360
If you're writing these letters
you'll destroy our lives. You hear me?

52:09.361 --> 52:10.190
Enough.

52:12.429 --> 52:13.293
Enough.

52:36.453 --> 52:37.010
Hello?

52:39.590 --> 52:41.080
Yeah, I'm on my way.

52:42.760 --> 52:44.318
No, I'm coming home now.

52:46.430 --> 52:47.089
All right.

54:10.714 --> 54:12.615
What part of our conversation...

54:12.616 --> 54:14.015
made you take another
two hours to get home?

54:14.016 --> 54:16.017
- Did he call back?
- I am asking you a question.

54:16.018 --> 54:17.619
Did he call back?
Kerry, I love you.

54:17.620 --> 54:19.755
- I'm asking you a fucking question!
- Shut the fuck up, man!

54:19.756 --> 54:21.156
You just can't fucking talk
to me right now!

54:21.157 --> 54:22.324
I love you Kerry,
so just stop. Stop, all right?

54:22.325 --> 54:24.059
Don't tell me you love me.
Don't tell me that.

54:24.060 --> 54:25.358
Why don't you look at me?

54:25.963 --> 54:29.296
Why don't you fucking look at me?
Look at me!

54:30.334 --> 54:31.323
Look at me!

54:32.069 --> 54:34.731
Look at me! Stop staring
at the sink! You look at me!

54:35.305 --> 54:36.795
You look at me!

54:45.048 --> 54:46.037
My God!

54:48.418 --> 54:49.476
What happened?

54:56.193 --> 54:57.091
What happened?

55:52.049 --> 55:53.607
I never...

55:54.952 --> 55:56.943
I never told anyone else.

55:59.156 --> 56:01.249
I didn't. I never told.

56:06.196 --> 56:07.060
I'm sorry.

56:15.405 --> 56:16.929
I'll never tell anyone.

56:22.746 --> 56:24.771
Okay, here he is.

56:26.383 --> 56:28.977
Look who's here.
Detective Stanford.

56:29.186 --> 56:31.086
He's gonna ask you
some questions.

56:31.154 --> 56:32.678
- Hey, Jonathan.
- All right?

56:33.657 --> 56:34.624
Okay, Mrs. White.

56:34.691 --> 56:36.792
I'm going to the store.
I'll see you later.

56:36.793 --> 56:38.124
Okay, thanks.

56:41.465 --> 56:43.160
Sit down.

56:43.967 --> 56:45.195
Why don't you just sit down?

56:46.436 --> 56:49.928
Your grandmother told me about
your dog. I just heard about it.

56:50.007 --> 56:52.567
I'm so sorry.
It's just awful.

56:55.846 --> 56:58.974
Nothing quite as painful
in this world as that.

57:01.285 --> 57:03.219
Dog's name was Charlie,
right?

57:07.224 --> 57:10.284
You know, Jonathan,
I don't apologize about things...

57:10.360 --> 57:16.822
but I have to say I shouldn't have
paraded you around here, like I did.

57:17.134 --> 57:21.468
That was, it wasn't right.
You see...

57:24.508 --> 57:25.998
when your father died...

57:32.883 --> 57:36.512
I had an obligation.
You understand?

57:36.586 --> 57:39.646
It wasn't like we worked
in a department store together...

57:40.657 --> 57:43.148
or a bakery shop or something.
We were partners.

57:44.061 --> 57:46.859
And when you're partners,
you're family...

57:48.765 --> 57:51.632
like you are
with your grandmother.

57:56.540 --> 58:00.704
I got two dead bodies
on my hands, Jonathan.

58:01.278 --> 58:02.609
Now, that's a lot.

58:03.680 --> 58:08.947
I got barking dogs,
people looking through peepholes...

58:09.019 --> 58:13.217
drug talk about Hanky.
And it's all leading me...

58:15.959 --> 58:16.983
to this.

58:17.060 --> 58:18.049
To this.

58:18.128 --> 58:18.992
To this.

58:19.162 --> 58:20.186
To this.

58:29.339 --> 58:32.206
You know the severity
of which I'm talking about here.

58:34.077 --> 58:35.510
I want you to answer me.

58:41.251 --> 58:44.084
These buildings
are full of secrets, Milk.

58:45.689 --> 58:48.157
They're full of things people
shouldn't be doing.

58:49.726 --> 58:51.894
Mrs. Carter,
up on the sixth floor...

58:51.895 --> 58:55.023
she's telling me Little
Vinny's hearing voices again.

58:56.233 --> 58:57.666
What I'm gonna do with that?

58:59.002 --> 59:01.835
I gotta worry about my own.
I can't save the world.

59:01.905 --> 59:04.601
This ain't a fucking
Superman outfit I'm wearing.

59:14.184 --> 59:21.454
I've got two worthless pieces of over
21-year-old garbage that are dead.

59:23.126 --> 59:24.354
No one cares.

59:25.295 --> 59:28.128
Not a single fucking person.

59:30.200 --> 59:31.497
So what do I do?

59:33.637 --> 59:35.070
Case is closed.

59:36.206 --> 59:37.138
I closed it.

59:39.776 --> 59:42.506
So you can go live
your long life.

59:44.981 --> 59:46.812
Next time we meet though...

59:48.018 --> 59:50.316
you'll be a man like I am.

59:53.857 --> 59:58.487
And a man has to learn
to live with shit.

01:00:12.142 --> 01:00:12.870
Okay.

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:41.126
I noticed you got a rental.

01:00:43.273 --> 01:00:45.241
Come here, we need
to talk. Come on in.

01:00:48.612 --> 01:00:49.237
Come on.

01:00:55.952 --> 01:00:59.945
It's funny. Whoever's writing
these bullshit letters...

01:01:00.891 --> 01:01:04.486
seems to be interested in everyone,
except the actual fucking killers.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.797
It's time this shit stopped...

01:01:12.702 --> 01:01:13.600
don't you think?

01:01:22.913 --> 01:01:24.813
This next article comes out...

01:01:26.716 --> 01:01:27.944
naming names...

01:01:28.752 --> 01:01:30.549
all of us are fucked.

01:01:31.488 --> 01:01:32.352
But you...

01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:35.857
your life's destroyed.

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:42.161
Yours and your family's.
Obliterated.

01:01:46.736 --> 01:01:48.431
You understand
what I'm saying?

01:02:01.985 --> 01:02:03.714
This would be
the place for that.

01:02:05.789 --> 01:02:09.384
That thing that you're thinking
there, with your gun...

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:11.724
you ain't wrong in it.

01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:17.097
You're just projecting it
on the wrong people.

01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:23.702
Sit down, Jonathan.

01:02:37.053 --> 01:02:39.044
Let me tell you
something, Jonathan.

01:02:40.357 --> 01:02:43.520
All that guilt and hate...

01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:49.258
and all that other shit you've got
bottled up inside your fucked up head.

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:56.535
You've gotta realize what you
gotta do to save your own shit.

01:02:58.508 --> 01:03:02.103
I'm worried about a promotion,
simple things.

01:03:04.681 --> 01:03:09.448
You, this comes out...

01:03:09.686 --> 01:03:13.589
I'll see to it that your secret life
is the headline...

01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:15.854
in the New York
fucking-Times.

01:03:16.026 --> 01:03:20.827
And that, Milk, that's
what we're talking about now.

01:03:55.365 --> 01:03:56.889
Ms. Bridges! Ms Bridges!

01:03:57.834 --> 01:03:58.698
Ms. Bridges!

01:04:11.081 --> 01:04:14.073
So, brethren have been calling.
I know why you're here.

01:04:14.417 --> 01:04:16.715
No.
I'm here on my own.

01:04:17.987 --> 01:04:19.587
This has nothing
to do with the cops.

01:04:19.588 --> 01:04:21.255
This has everything to do
with the cops.

01:04:21.256 --> 01:04:23.191
- We're just getting a lot of pressure.
- We're?

01:04:23.259 --> 01:04:24.248
Yes, we're...

01:04:24.627 --> 01:04:26.129
You love that term
here in America.

01:04:26.130 --> 01:04:28.893
Makes you feel like you're
part of something, family.

01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:34.500
Everything about them
will be over come Saturday.

01:04:51.154 --> 01:04:53.782
The kind of thing
a newspaper should be breaking.

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:04.291
Not a single witness questioned.
Not a single suspect brought in.

01:05:04.968 --> 01:05:07.232
How very 1986.

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:10.834
This isn't out yet, is it?

01:05:11.574 --> 01:05:13.735
Saturday
is gonna be a huge day.

01:05:15.311 --> 01:05:17.575
Marion had me all confused,
and I kept thinking...

01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:21.050
he could give two damns
about these letters.

01:05:21.551 --> 01:05:25.487
And he's got plainclothes
following me over some articles?

01:05:25.555 --> 01:05:27.750
- Look, all I'm asking is...
- All you're asking...

01:05:27.824 --> 01:05:30.418
is exactly what your captain
sent you here to ask...

01:05:30.493 --> 01:05:32.791
and I'm not even sure
you know what that is.

01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:36.095
Okay.

01:05:42.238 --> 01:05:43.239
If this were a movie...

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:46.072
I'd say you looked like
you saw a ghost, Mr. White.

01:05:48.478 --> 01:05:49.843
Look, you can't print this.

01:05:52.715 --> 01:05:55.980
- Why wouldn't I?
- Please, sit down.

01:05:56.319 --> 01:05:57.183
Why wouldn't I...

01:05:59.055 --> 01:05:59.783
Please just.

01:06:05.328 --> 01:06:07.396
Can you give me a week?
Give me a week.

01:06:07.397 --> 01:06:10.566
Two murdered nobodies
from the projects you grew up in...

01:06:10.567 --> 01:06:14.560
are about to finally get the justice
they deserve after all these years.

01:06:14.938 --> 01:06:16.462
- You're not, you're not hearing me.
- Nothing's gonna change that.

01:06:16.539 --> 01:06:19.167
You're not hearing me.
Can you please...

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:24.705
Ms. Bridges, just hold
one second. Just hold...

01:06:27.417 --> 01:06:29.146
One second.
Just hold on, please!

01:06:31.387 --> 01:06:32.489
Bridges, please...

01:06:32.490 --> 01:06:35.822
- You can give me one week?
- Your father is dead, Mr. White.

01:06:35.892 --> 01:06:37.825
I'm not sorry,
because I didn't know him...

01:06:37.826 --> 01:06:39.529
but his partner's an old
man now, a dirty old man...

01:06:39.530 --> 01:06:42.157
full of dirty old man secrets...

01:06:42.232 --> 01:06:43.961
I get to fuck his legacy...

01:06:44.033 --> 01:06:45.432
and Mathers' future
in one shot.

01:06:45.702 --> 01:06:47.067
Gives me great delight.

01:07:45.194 --> 01:07:45.990
Hey, Vinny.

01:08:07.116 --> 01:08:08.845
You got something
you wanna say to me?

01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:22.390
You wanna talk to me?

01:08:23.366 --> 01:08:25.595
You wanna talk to me about
these letters you been writing?

01:08:43.653 --> 01:08:45.486
I remember when you
caught me up here...

01:08:45.487 --> 01:08:46.921
on the roof
with my mother's boyfriend.

01:08:48.992 --> 01:08:50.550
You never told nobody.

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:54.622
Why you never told nobody?

01:09:01.504 --> 01:09:05.600
'Cause you was my friend?
Are you still my friend?

01:09:14.651 --> 01:09:17.245
When the pressures
and things started to happen...

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:24.656
you was the only one that came
to see me in the hospital.

01:09:26.395 --> 01:09:28.863
They made me drink
all that stuff.

01:09:30.198 --> 01:09:34.658
Couldn't say my words right.
Couldn't talk.

01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:39.975
But you did talk.

01:09:42.879 --> 01:09:45.346
- I tried to say it.
- But you did talk.

01:09:46.716 --> 01:09:47.876
You did talk.

01:09:50.219 --> 01:09:52.345
You said that you weren't gonna
say nothing to nobody.

01:09:55.391 --> 01:09:58.292
But you fucked both of our
lives up in this shit, man.

01:10:01.764 --> 01:10:03.459
You said you weren't
gonna tell nobody.

01:10:08.838 --> 01:10:10.465
I think I'm gonna go.

01:10:13.509 --> 01:10:14.976
I knew you would do good.

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:21.380
I think I'm gonna go.

01:10:24.687 --> 01:10:25.949
You're gonna be fine.

01:11:09.866 --> 01:11:10.457
Hello?

01:11:10.767 --> 01:11:13.930
<i>Do I need to talk to your</i>
<i>wife to get this done?</i>

01:11:14.036 --> 01:11:16.630
- What?
- <i>Is that I'm gonna have to do?</i>

01:11:17.673 --> 01:11:19.197
Kerry, you know
where my gun is?

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:19.707
<i>What?</i>

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:21.676
- You know where my gun is.
- <i>I'm calling the cops, Johnny.</i>

01:11:21.744 --> 01:11:24.338
You're on with a fucking cop!
I'm on my way.

01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:53.271
I don't know.

01:11:56.045 --> 01:11:56.909
You don't know.

01:12:00.583 --> 01:12:01.208
No.

01:12:03.586 --> 01:12:05.577
You don't know why people
are calling about a murder...

01:12:06.022 --> 01:12:09.116
or why your car was totaled
or what's going on?

01:12:09.192 --> 01:12:13.026
Because eventually you're gonna have
to know something, Jonathan. You are.

01:12:14.130 --> 01:12:16.064
You are.
I am talking to you!

01:12:16.065 --> 01:12:18.090
Please, just don't
touch me right now.

01:12:22.104 --> 01:12:23.935
I just wanted to give us
a normal life.

01:12:25.141 --> 01:12:29.840
I just wanted to give us
a normal life.

01:12:30.213 --> 01:12:31.840
- He said it's all.
- What does that mean?

01:12:37.119 --> 01:12:39.019
It means I don't know
what to do about this.

01:12:41.524 --> 01:12:43.116
I have no idea
what to do about this.

01:12:45.127 --> 01:12:46.560
It comes out next week.

01:12:51.634 --> 01:12:53.295
I killed those people, Ker.

01:13:00.276 --> 01:13:02.301
I killed the people those
letters are talking about.

01:13:05.414 --> 01:13:06.938
I killed both of those people.

01:13:13.089 --> 01:13:15.421
Charlie? Shit. Charlie!

01:13:18.728 --> 01:13:19.422
Char...

01:13:22.365 --> 01:13:25.061
It's okay. It's okay.

01:13:26.369 --> 01:13:28.166
Okay, darling.

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:30.762
- I'll the ambulance.
- She's fine. Let her sleep it off.

01:13:31.107 --> 01:13:36.477
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

01:13:37.413 --> 01:13:40.041
Mama's here.
Mama's here.

01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:41.948
Mama's here.

01:13:43.586 --> 01:13:44.484
Mama's here.

01:14:01.203 --> 01:14:04.570
<i>So as it's coming in last night</i>
<i>at approximately 7:45 local...</i>

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:07.905
<i>writer and columnist for The Queens</i>
<i>Gazette, Lauren Bridges...</i>

01:14:07.977 --> 01:14:09.911
<i>was gunned down</i>
<i>execution style...</i>

01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:13.946
<i>at the foot of her office</i>
<i>on 31st Street in Astoria, Queens.</i>

01:14:14.050 --> 01:14:15.039
<i>Witnesses say...</i>

01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:18.416
<i>one man in a black ski mask</i>
<i>was last seen running right here...</i>

01:14:18.888 --> 01:14:19.786
Oh, my God.

01:14:22.725 --> 01:14:24.124
That's the woman
from the paper.

01:14:26.228 --> 01:14:27.718
She was killed, Jonathan.

01:14:34.503 --> 01:14:37.267
- Hello?
- <i>Prudenti's outside.</i>

01:14:39.175 --> 01:14:40.199
<i>You'll take a drive.</i>

01:14:40.276 --> 01:14:43.370
You fuck with my family, I swear
I'll kill you. I don't care who you are.

01:14:43.612 --> 01:14:47.275
<i>You're watching the news right now.</i>
<i>You know how serious I am.</i>

01:14:47.883 --> 01:14:51.512
<i>Now get in his fucking car</i>
<i>and go.</i>

01:15:03.733 --> 01:15:04.825
I'm taking my own car.

01:15:07.203 --> 01:15:07.862
You got it.

01:15:30.192 --> 01:15:31.853
It's fucked up
about that dyke.

01:15:34.497 --> 01:15:35.327
Fuck her though.

01:16:07.797 --> 01:16:08.923
<i>Let's swing it right there.</i>

01:16:15.104 --> 01:16:16.935
- Where?
- Pull up.

01:16:20.276 --> 01:16:22.369
All right. Here.

01:16:54.443 --> 01:16:55.273
Go ahead.

01:17:08.591 --> 01:17:09.319
Come on in.

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:31.613
- Fuck you want from me?
- Okay. Come on.

01:17:37.153 --> 01:17:38.381
Have a seat over here.

01:17:42.725 --> 01:17:45.421
Tommy, close the door.
Come on. Sit down.

01:17:56.238 --> 01:18:00.572
All right, how about I sit
first. Have a seat.

01:18:13.455 --> 01:18:16.447
Love fades. Did you ever
hear that expression?

01:18:18.327 --> 01:18:19.419
Less than a year ago...

01:18:19.495 --> 01:18:22.225
we lost almost 400 fellow,
officers and firemen...

01:18:22.464 --> 01:18:25.160
and people are already getting
tired of saying thank you.

01:18:26.202 --> 01:18:27.226
It's a tough city.

01:18:28.404 --> 01:18:31.965
These are photographs of you
and Lauren Bridges at Mike's Diner...

01:18:32.141 --> 01:18:33.267
seven p. M...

01:18:34.076 --> 01:18:37.409
the night that she
was murdered. Last night.

01:18:39.014 --> 01:18:42.142
Those pictures could cause you
a lot of problems, I imagine.

01:18:42.985 --> 01:18:45.044
- You killed her.
- Jonathan...

01:18:46.689 --> 01:18:48.523
- Sit down.
- Easy. Go easy.

01:18:48.524 --> 01:18:50.992
Thomas put it away.

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:54.028
- Put it away now.
- That's okay. Just go sit over there.

01:18:54.029 --> 01:18:55.553
- What's going on?
- Everything's okay.

01:18:57.066 --> 01:19:00.331
Just do what he says.
Just relax.

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:03.064
Jonathan,
you don't recognize me?

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:08.376
- Yeah, I recognize you.
- That's good.

01:19:09.345 --> 01:19:11.176
I'm glad to hear that.
Sit down.

01:19:13.649 --> 01:19:15.082
Sit.
We're gonna talk.

01:19:15.217 --> 01:19:17.777
You have to excuse
my godson Marion.

01:19:17.853 --> 01:19:21.311
He has a tendency
to draw things out.

01:19:26.729 --> 01:19:29.289
Last I saw you,
you were a boy.

01:19:29.531 --> 01:19:31.226
I was a man.

01:19:32.067 --> 01:19:34.092
Look at me now.

01:19:39.174 --> 01:19:43.008
Jonathan, shouldn't be
concerned about this.

01:19:44.513 --> 01:19:47.515
This is family matters,
it's between all of us.

01:19:47.516 --> 01:19:51.782
You're here because, in 1986.
You and your friend Vincent Carter...

01:19:51.854 --> 01:19:54.555
killed the two men referred
to in this bitch's articles.

01:19:54.556 --> 01:19:55.648
They were no good.

01:19:56.925 --> 01:19:58.191
This is a family, Jonathan...

01:19:58.192 --> 01:20:00.661
that you passed your civil
service test to rejoin.

01:20:00.729 --> 01:20:02.822
Listen, I knew
your godfather.

01:20:02.898 --> 01:20:05.093
No, I know you did.
He was your dad's partner.

01:20:05.367 --> 01:20:07.597
And, as you can see now,
he's an old man.

01:20:07.670 --> 01:20:09.900
Stop talking about me
like I was not here.

01:20:10.239 --> 01:20:13.675
Stop talking about me like
I'm not in the fucking room!

01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:20.482
After all these years,
none of us were gonna allow...

01:20:20.483 --> 01:20:22.848
the good names
of our family to go down...

01:20:23.018 --> 01:20:27.387
because he did what was right
for two ungrateful punk murderers...

01:20:28.123 --> 01:20:30.353
especially on the verge
of his retirement.

01:20:30.426 --> 01:20:33.156
- You mean on your inauguration?
- I did what I had to do.

01:20:33.429 --> 01:20:35.761
I did it for you and I did it
for your father.

01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:38.095
That's who I did it for.
I had to do it.

01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:41.330
Bridges first told me about
the letters, I could give a shit.

01:20:41.470 --> 01:20:43.806
- But then they just kept on coming.
- They just kept coming.

01:20:43.807 --> 01:20:46.774
We knew it either had to be you
or that other piece of garbage.

01:20:46.775 --> 01:20:49.767
- But it didn't make any sense to us.
- That's right.

01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:51.073
You'd gotten away with it.

01:20:51.246 --> 01:20:54.079
So we figured you were just
suffering from a guilty conscience.

01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:57.209
- We thought you were a fucking moron.
- So we brought you back.

01:20:57.286 --> 01:20:59.654
Turns out you didn't have
any conscience at all.

01:20:59.655 --> 01:21:03.887
All the while it was your brain-damaged
friend with the desire to talk...

01:21:04.259 --> 01:21:07.562
to confess,
to write the letters...

01:21:07.563 --> 01:21:09.664
to be a fucking retard.

01:21:09.665 --> 01:21:11.428
But you were a good kid,
Jonathan.

01:21:11.667 --> 01:21:16.400
So, let us take care of this here.
Let us do it.

01:21:16.472 --> 01:21:19.236
- I've got a family.
- Of course you got a family.

01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:23.201
This is what you've gotta do.

01:21:24.179 --> 01:21:26.272
- Listen to him.
- He's listening.

01:21:26.348 --> 01:21:27.713
Just listen to him, Jonathan.

01:21:28.617 --> 01:21:30.517
You're gonna get back
in your car now...

01:21:31.353 --> 01:21:34.049
and you're gonna drive
home to your daughter, Charlotte.

01:21:35.057 --> 01:21:39.861
And, on that long drive home, you're
gonna think about her pretty face...

01:21:39.862 --> 01:21:44.629
your beautiful wife, and your nice
life out there on the island.

01:21:45.267 --> 01:21:49.328
And after you get there, you're
gonna think how lucky you are...

01:21:49.405 --> 01:21:52.272
to have half the 118
working overtime...

01:21:52.641 --> 01:21:54.905
to ensure
that nobody finds out...

01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:58.341
that you're a cold-blooded killer.

01:21:58.414 --> 01:22:02.043
- I'm not no murderer.
- You're a murderer, Jonathan.

01:22:02.551 --> 01:22:05.543
Jonathan, you get back here,
it'll be like it never happened.

01:22:05.621 --> 01:22:07.389
You'll get a transfer
back to the land...

01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:09.823
where DUIs
are your biggest concern.

01:22:10.826 --> 01:22:14.262
Here in Queens, they'll be
a tiny blurb in a little paper...

01:22:14.263 --> 01:22:15.696
about a crazed fan...

01:22:15.864 --> 01:22:17.991
who wrote letters
to a lonely woman.

01:22:19.101 --> 01:22:23.231
Killed her and then
he takes his own life.

01:22:25.007 --> 01:22:26.804
And life will go on.

01:22:27.643 --> 01:22:29.804
The life you never
dreamed you'd have.

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:32.307
Got it?

01:22:33.482 --> 01:22:35.177
- It's gonna be okay then.
- Good.

01:22:36.418 --> 01:22:37.885
It'll be okay, Jonathan.

01:22:39.655 --> 01:22:40.314
Go.

01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:43.389
You're okay, Jonathan.

01:23:27.703 --> 01:23:31.139
<i>Here in Queens, there'll be</i>

01:23:51.827 --> 01:23:52.494

01:23:52.495 --> 01:23:54.257
I hate it here
so fucking much.

01:23:58.700 --> 01:23:59.325
Vinny?

01:23:59.902 --> 01:24:01.961
I never told.
Never.

01:24:13.615 --> 01:24:16.778
Whatever you and your
little friend did, Milk...

01:24:19.488 --> 01:24:21.046
whatever it was...

01:24:22.991 --> 01:24:24.549
I could give two shits.

01:24:27.362 --> 01:24:29.421
<i>You're gonna have</i>
<i>to learn to deal with it...</i>

01:24:30.966 --> 01:24:31.933
<i>live with it...</i>

01:24:34.269 --> 01:24:35.497

01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:38.970
<i>Remember...</i>

01:24:42.344 --> 01:24:44.278
<i>this is the last time we meet...</i>

01:24:47.049 --> 01:24:48.539
<i>as man and child.</i>

01:24:49.885 --> 01:24:50.476
Vinny?

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:52.243
Shit!

01:24:55.958 --> 01:24:57.016
<i>And a man...</i>

01:24:59.695 --> 01:25:00.957
<i>has to learn...</i>

01:25:02.898 --> 01:25:03.728
<i>to live...</i>

01:25:08.136 --> 01:25:09.194
<i>with shit.</i>

01:25:09.805 --> 01:25:10.362
Vinny!

01:25:15.444 --> 01:25:17.878
No, no! Jonathan!

01:25:17.879 --> 01:25:19.145
Stupid motherfucker!
Jonathan.

01:25:19.146 --> 01:25:21.281
- We told you to go home!
- Get a hold of yourself!

01:25:21.282 --> 01:25:22.272
You, come here.

01:25:22.517 --> 01:25:23.851
Come here! Retard!

01:25:23.852 --> 01:25:24.910
Stop!

01:25:25.087 --> 01:25:26.384
Get a hold of yourself!

01:25:26.455 --> 01:25:26.944
Get the fuck off me!

01:25:27.122 --> 01:25:28.188
Back the fuck off.

01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:29.248
You gonna shoot me now?

01:25:29.591 --> 01:25:31.183
Back the fuck off.

01:25:31.994 --> 01:25:34.792
- He didn't kill nobody!
- You stay the fuck down!

01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:36.497
Stay down!

01:25:36.898 --> 01:25:38.166
He ruined your life!

01:25:38.167 --> 01:25:41.397
Now, you're gonna take this gun and
you're gonna shoot him in his head.

01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:44.530
Stay fucking down!

01:25:44.873 --> 01:25:47.068
Take his fucking gun and shoot him!
Shut the fuck up!

01:25:47.142 --> 01:25:48.905
He ruined your life.
Do you hear me?

01:25:49.077 --> 01:25:51.412
He ruined your fucking life.

01:25:51.413 --> 01:25:54.081
- He didn't kill anybody!
- You both did! Forget it!

01:25:54.082 --> 01:25:54.878
Shoot him!

01:26:00.822 --> 01:26:01.789
My God.

01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:05.319
No!

01:26:07.996 --> 01:26:08.792
Vin!

01:26:32.821 --> 01:26:34.880
Another step, I end it.

01:26:36.558 --> 01:26:37.388
I end it.

01:26:44.032 --> 01:26:47.263
You go now.
You keep going.

01:26:50.472 --> 01:26:51.962
You go, you keep going.

01:26:53.141 --> 01:26:56.406
Keep going. Let him go.
Let him go!

01:26:57.546 --> 01:27:01.312
You can hate me
all you want, Jonathan!

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:03.110
All you want!

01:27:03.952 --> 01:27:05.920
But you're a free man now!

01:27:07.322 --> 01:27:08.721
You're a free man!

01:27:28.143 --> 01:27:28.700
Milk.

01:27:32.013 --> 01:27:32.707
Milk...

01:27:36.985 --> 01:27:39.783
- Never told nobody.
- I know, I know.

01:27:41.089 --> 01:27:42.750
Never told nobody.

01:27:44.926 --> 01:27:45.790
I'm sorry.

01:27:46.695 --> 01:27:50.961
- It's okay. It's okay, Vinny.
- Milk...

01:28:10.418 --> 01:28:11.715
<i>Jonathan White.</i>

01:28:15.824 --> 01:28:17.724
<i>I never meant for this to hurt you.</i>

01:28:19.628 --> 01:28:20.560
<i>Or Vinny.</i>

01:28:22.397 --> 01:28:23.329
<i>Or anyone.</i>

01:28:26.067 --> 01:28:27.557
<i>It was always them.</i>

01:28:31.439 --> 01:28:34.636
<i>In the end, we matter.</i>

01:28:37.779 --> 01:28:42.512
<i>And now, one of them is</i>
<i>dead and the other...</i>

01:28:45.287 --> 01:28:48.051
<i>No one cares about a
foolish old man.</i>

01:28:51.126 --> 01:28:52.593
<i>Funny how things work out.</i>

01:28:57.999 --> 01:28:59.523
<i>This will be my last letter.</i>

01:29:01.803 --> 01:29:03.202
<i>Go live your life.</i>

01:29:05.507 --> 01:29:06.872
<i>You're free to do that.</i>

01:29:09.277 --> 01:29:10.301
<i>Free to forget.</i>

01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:13.108
<i>Vicky.</i>
