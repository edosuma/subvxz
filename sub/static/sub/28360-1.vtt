01:42.301 --> 01:46.702
We have some new additions
to our home, Jay and Willy.

01:46.704 --> 01:48.772
They'll be sharing
a room with Jeremy.

01:48.774 --> 01:51.909
Jay and Willy, we all chip
in to keep things running

01:51.911 --> 01:54.877
smooth and comfortable
to keep the house clean,

01:54.879 --> 01:56.415
so feel free to help out.

01:57.615 --> 01:59.916
And remember, we're
you're house parents,

01:59.918 --> 02:01.487
we're here for
whatever you need.

02:03.289 --> 02:04.557
Now we can bow our heads.

02:07.893 --> 02:09.893
Father, bless this food.

02:09.895 --> 02:12.461
Thank you for the
nourishment it provides.

02:12.463 --> 02:14.364
We welcome Jay and
Willy into our home,

02:14.366 --> 02:16.500
and we thank
you that they can be with us.

02:17.603 --> 02:20.436
As we enjoy this meal and
after help us be mindful

02:20.438 --> 02:22.305
of the needs of others.

02:22.307 --> 02:24.144
Amen.

02:55.807 --> 02:57.441
Where you going?

02:57.443 --> 02:59.476
What your back, bro,
something out there,

02:59.478 --> 03:01.213
and it ain't friendly.

04:24.062 --> 04:24.894
Represent.

04:26.031 --> 04:26.930
Represent.

04:27.966 --> 04:29.031
Represent.

04:29.033 --> 04:30.269
Represent.

04:31.002 --> 04:31.837
Represent.

04:41.779 --> 04:42.913
What's up, man?

05:38.205 --> 05:41.676
Good morning, Mr. Tibbe,
we're glad you're here, welcome.

05:42.844 --> 05:45.745
Okay, class, you have
a choice this semester.

05:45.747 --> 05:48.048
For your extra credit
assignment you can either

05:48.050 --> 05:51.650
keep a journal or you can
write a letter every week.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.118
Yes?

05:53.120 --> 05:55.322
If we write a journal,
that's like a diary, right?

05:55.324 --> 05:56.255
Right.

05:56.257 --> 05:57.190
You're not gonna read them?

05:57.192 --> 05:59.159
No, no, I'm just
gonna flip through it,

05:59.161 --> 06:01.327
make sure you did it,
everybody gets an A.

06:01.329 --> 06:02.361
And what about the letters?

06:02.363 --> 06:03.296
Are you gonna read those?

06:03.298 --> 06:04.800
No, same thing.

06:06.168 --> 06:07.233
Good, 'cause I don't
think you should be looking

06:07.235 --> 06:08.304
at our private stuff.

06:09.303 --> 06:10.639
I agree, Angela.

06:12.673 --> 06:15.609
But, you know, I think you
should mail those letters.

06:15.611 --> 06:18.044
Letter writing is a lost art.

06:18.046 --> 06:19.678
I think that they
will have a big impact

06:19.680 --> 06:21.281
on whoever reads 'em.

06:33.829 --> 06:35.764
So, where you headed?

06:36.932 --> 06:37.767
I'm Willy.

06:39.101 --> 06:40.200
I have stuff to do.

06:40.202 --> 06:42.238
Stuff, I like stuff.

06:43.404 --> 06:46.107
Hey, Angela, you're
looking good today.

06:48.010 --> 06:49.743
You know that guy
runs like a girl.

06:49.745 --> 06:52.615
I'm a girl, and I could
run circles around you.

06:56.784 --> 06:58.286
Um, uh, I'll see you later.

07:04.392 --> 07:05.859
You need to be in school.

07:05.861 --> 07:07.726
You need structure
and stability,

07:07.728 --> 07:09.395
and I can't give that
to you right now.

07:09.397 --> 07:11.164
I don't understand
why I just can't go

07:11.166 --> 07:12.364
on the road with you.

07:12.366 --> 07:13.465
We
tried that approach

07:13.467 --> 07:16.237
and we both got in trouble,
so we're trying this now.

07:17.372 --> 07:18.871
You can't keep me here.

07:18.873 --> 07:20.675
First chance I get,
I'm gonna leave.

07:43.998 --> 07:49.004
Yeah, looking good,
champ, looking good.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.371
I give you another mile
before you pass out

07:51.373 --> 07:53.642
from heat exhaustion,
the way you're dressed.

07:55.209 --> 07:56.378
Also, you got no water,

07:58.380 --> 07:59.113
got no form,

08:01.450 --> 08:03.219
you're sucking wind
after one hill.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.288
What do you care?

08:08.824 --> 08:10.056
Who are you anyway?

08:10.058 --> 08:10.925
Coach Davis.

08:12.928 --> 08:15.962
You know if you like to run,
you can come run for me.

08:15.964 --> 08:17.266
Practice everyday at four.

08:18.834 --> 08:20.467
Of course from the looks of you,

08:20.469 --> 08:22.301
I'm not sure you could
hang with my runners.

08:22.303 --> 08:24.203
Whatever, man, I
smoke those dudes.

08:24.205 --> 08:26.341
Oh, you smoke those
dudes, cool.

08:28.075 --> 08:30.310
You're welcome to come
prove that if you want,

08:30.312 --> 08:32.948
but please, carry on.

08:34.315 --> 08:35.351
Have a nice day.

09:05.847 --> 09:06.482
Yeah?

09:07.983 --> 09:08.914
Got a sec?

09:08.916 --> 09:10.085
Yeah, Chaplin, come on in.

09:12.521 --> 09:14.520
Listen, Mitch, I wanna
apologize about this morning.

09:14.522 --> 09:16.157
We didn't have time to speak.

09:17.258 --> 09:19.358
I am sorry about Michael.

09:19.360 --> 09:20.526
I know you loved the kid.

09:20.528 --> 09:22.428
And I know Jeanie loved him too.

09:22.430 --> 09:24.164
Yeah, actually
I'm glad you came in

09:24.166 --> 09:26.432
because I wanna talk to you
about this new kid, Willy--

09:27.935 --> 09:29.269
Hold on a second.

09:29.271 --> 09:30.502
Davis.

09:30.504 --> 09:32.404
Coach,
Andy Andrews here

09:32.406 --> 09:34.173
from the Brentmoor Mustangs.

09:34.175 --> 09:35.274
Hi, how are you?

09:35.276 --> 09:37.544
Good, good, we're
good, ranked number one

09:37.546 --> 09:40.513
in the state again,
happy about that.

09:40.515 --> 09:42.048
Oh, congratulations.

09:42.050 --> 09:43.382
Thank you,
sir, well, listen,

09:43.384 --> 09:44.951
I'll cut to the chase,

09:44.953 --> 09:46.952
I'm moving up to athletic
director next year

09:46.954 --> 09:49.389
and I'm looking for a cross
country coach to replace me.

09:49.391 --> 09:52.292
I've been looking at your
program there for a long time,

09:52.294 --> 09:53.559
always been impressed,

09:53.561 --> 09:55.130
and I'd like you to
come visit us here.

10:11.412 --> 10:14.047
Yo, your mom's on the phone.

10:14.049 --> 10:14.917
I'm not here.

10:16.350 --> 10:17.852
Come on, bro, it's your mom.

10:36.637 --> 10:37.473
Hey, mom.

10:39.373 --> 10:42.007
You
know I love you, right?

10:42.009 --> 10:44.209
Mom, I can barely hear you.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.381
I found
your dad's information,

10:47.214 --> 10:48.249
gonna send it to you.

10:50.352 --> 10:51.921
My, my dad?

10:53.454 --> 10:55.321
- I
- love you very much.

10:55.323 --> 10:56.325
Mom, what?

10:57.592 --> 11:00.596
You're my only man.

11:02.296 --> 11:03.199
Mom, mom?

11:04.999 --> 11:06.632
Mom!

11:32.393 --> 11:33.228
Jeremy?

11:35.563 --> 11:39.401
It's okay, you know,
this is the house of God.

11:42.637 --> 11:44.239
You don't need to break into it.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.557
How'd you know I was here?

12:05.326 --> 12:06.594
Well, it's our job
to know things, son.

12:13.600 --> 12:18.573
Don't forget to lock up.

13:02.416 --> 13:03.415
Hey, what's up?

13:03.417 --> 13:04.686
Hey.

13:06.320 --> 13:07.720
So, where
are we heading?

13:07.722 --> 13:10.192
You never let up, do you?

13:14.362 --> 13:15.694
Well, I'll see you at school.

13:15.696 --> 13:18.430
Oh, I was gonna walk you home.

13:18.432 --> 13:21.135
Sorry, cowboy, no
boys pass the stop sign.

13:28.443 --> 13:31.611
Yeah, I'm not very
good at following rules.

13:31.613 --> 13:32.214
I can tell.

13:33.348 --> 13:35.213
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

13:35.215 --> 13:36.515
Bye.

13:36.517 --> 13:37.319
Bye.

13:41.723 --> 13:44.222
Stretch
out those shoulders,

13:44.224 --> 13:46.228
extension, flexion.

13:48.496 --> 13:50.295
How's everybody doing
in school, good?

13:50.297 --> 13:51.764
- Good.
- I'm not gonna hear

13:51.766 --> 13:52.731
about how you're falling behind?

13:52.733 --> 13:53.665
No, Coach.

13:53.667 --> 13:54.733
Turn in your homework?

13:54.735 --> 13:56.535
Yes, Coach.

13:56.537 --> 13:59.140
Oh, hi, Jay,
what time you got?

14:00.675 --> 14:02.741
I assume you're all
warmed up since you're not

14:02.743 --> 14:04.747
stretching with the rest
of us, is that right?

14:05.680 --> 14:06.712
Yeah.

14:06.714 --> 14:07.545
Ah, okay, good.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.182
Well, I guess you're
gonna run well.

14:09.184 --> 14:11.252
Let's go, line up.

14:15.690 --> 14:19.357
So we got two new guys who're
gonna get their wristbands,

14:19.359 --> 14:20.793
gonna represent.

14:20.795 --> 14:21.630
On my whistle.

14:22.696 --> 14:23.795
On set.

14:48.890 --> 14:52.290
Good effort.

14:52.292 --> 14:53.826
Good effort, Jay, good effort.

14:53.828 --> 14:55.861
Grab some water, get
ready for the next lap.

14:55.863 --> 14:56.962
What?

14:56.964 --> 14:58.497
I said grab some water,
get ready for the next lap.

14:58.499 --> 14:59.598
I just ran.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.366
Yeah, you ran the warm
up lap. You got three more.

15:01.368 --> 15:02.869
Grab some water.

15:02.871 --> 15:03.702
Stupid.

15:03.704 --> 15:04.803
All
right, guys, come on.

15:04.805 --> 15:05.740
That right?

15:06.807 --> 15:07.742
Let's go.

15:08.843 --> 15:11.244
On my whistle, runners set.

15:13.815 --> 15:15.150
Good job, how're you doing?

15:16.483 --> 15:17.717
What's going on.

15:17.719 --> 15:19.751
Run another lap,
how you doing?

15:19.753 --> 15:20.589
You okay?

15:21.823 --> 15:22.822
Give me your best effort?

15:22.824 --> 15:24.325
- Yeah.
- That's all I ask for.

15:25.560 --> 15:26.726
Don't worry about them.

15:26.728 --> 15:27.659
You wanna go again?

15:27.661 --> 15:28.827
Yeah.

15:28.829 --> 15:30.833
I'll run
this one with you.

15:32.333 --> 15:33.165
Come on.

15:39.773 --> 15:40.707
You okay?

15:40.709 --> 15:44.512
Yes, it's hard
to breath sometimes.

16:32.859 --> 16:36.462
Jay, come on buddy, wake up.

16:37.864 --> 16:38.700
Let's go.

16:52.946 --> 16:54.182
Get over here.

16:55.516 --> 16:56.351
Please.

17:00.622 --> 17:02.757
Hey, how's it going?

17:09.863 --> 17:12.401
So, Jay, I hear
you're from Lubbock.

17:14.502 --> 17:16.838
I lived in Lubbock for
two years, I went to Tech.

17:19.272 --> 17:20.472
It was pretty cool.

17:20.473 --> 17:23.911
Um, the, the sand storms
are crazy out there.

17:25.280 --> 17:26.978
I'm originally from Houston,

17:26.980 --> 17:28.948
so it was definitely
a culture shock

17:28.950 --> 17:30.285
when I came here, for sure.

17:31.319 --> 17:32.550
You can force me to come here,

17:32.552 --> 17:34.820
but you can't make
me talk to you.

17:34.822 --> 17:36.792
That's all right,
just sit and hang out.

17:38.759 --> 17:39.861
We'll talk when you're ready.

17:56.911 --> 17:57.746
Boo!

18:00.948 --> 18:02.848
What ya doing?

18:02.850 --> 18:04.883
Homework, how 'bout you?

18:04.885 --> 18:07.519
I'm about to go
feed the horses.

18:07.521 --> 18:08.356
You wanna come?

18:08.989 --> 18:10.025
Yeah.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.458
You like horses?

18:13.460 --> 18:14.462
Yeah, who doesn't?

18:25.605 --> 18:27.105
This is Buttercup.

18:27.107 --> 18:28.573
Yeah, she's pretty.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.376
And this is Stranger.

18:30.378 --> 18:30.979
Nice.

18:32.346 --> 18:36.050
This is Dash, but
I call her Starlight.

18:36.984 --> 18:38.687
I don't know, I
just like it better.

18:41.722 --> 18:42.987
Do you wanna feed one?

18:42.989 --> 18:44.692
Yeah, of course.

18:46.026 --> 18:47.493
Here.

18:52.967 --> 18:54.703
Keep your hand flat.

18:56.871 --> 18:57.873
There you go.

19:00.874 --> 19:01.742
You're a natural.

19:02.610 --> 19:04.043
Yeah, thanks.

19:04.045 --> 19:05.878
And that's Goldie, by the way.

19:05.880 --> 19:07.012
She'll be at the prairie ride.

19:07.014 --> 19:09.114
Hey, Goldie,
me, you, tomorrow.

19:09.116 --> 19:09.948
Got it?

19:10.985 --> 19:11.816
You're the man.

19:11.818 --> 19:12.653
Will you be there?

19:13.955 --> 19:14.990
Maybe.

19:15.989 --> 19:16.988
Okay.

19:43.985 --> 19:46.685
Okay, guys, when
we get to the gate

19:46.687 --> 19:49.121
it's an invitation
to grand silence.

19:49.123 --> 19:51.924
Now grand silence is
not about being quiet,

19:51.926 --> 19:53.793
it's about being still.

19:53.795 --> 19:56.027
It's about looking
inside yourself,

19:56.029 --> 19:58.933
and letting go of
whatever burdens you have.

20:00.101 --> 20:01.199
Now when we get to
the edge of the world,

20:01.201 --> 20:04.769
there'll be another invitation
to take those burdens

20:04.771 --> 20:06.474
and lay them down before God.

20:07.909 --> 20:11.910
Now adjourning scripture is
Matthew 11:28 through 30.

20:11.912 --> 20:15.180
Jesus said, "Come unto
me all you who are weary

20:15.182 --> 20:18.583
"and carry heavy burdens,
and I will give you rest.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.087
"Take my yoke upon you

20:21.555 --> 20:26.127
"let me teach you, for I am
humble and gentle in heart,

20:27.094 --> 20:28.529
"and you will find
rest for your souls.

20:29.697 --> 20:32.501
"My burden is easy,
my yoke is light."

20:37.103 --> 20:40.139
Shh.

23:56.269 --> 23:58.203
Represent.

23:58.205 --> 23:59.204
Represent.

24:00.306 --> 24:01.907
Represent.

24:01.909 --> 24:03.676
Goal posts.

24:05.278 --> 24:06.311
Represent.

24:06.313 --> 24:07.146
Hey, Coach.

24:07.148 --> 24:08.380
Represent.

24:08.382 --> 24:10.352
Excuse me, Mr. Purple
Shirt, come back here.

24:11.686 --> 24:12.884
You, come on.

24:12.886 --> 24:14.355
Go, hustle back, jog back.

24:16.222 --> 24:17.421
I was pacing myself.

24:17.423 --> 24:20.295
Uh huh, does this mean you
would like to join the team?

24:21.194 --> 24:22.194
Yeah.

24:22.196 --> 24:23.795
Yes, Coach.

24:23.797 --> 24:25.096
Yes, Coach.

24:25.098 --> 24:27.932
In that case, you show
up on time, every time,

24:27.934 --> 24:28.936
not a half hour late.

24:30.136 --> 24:32.004
You listen to what I tell you,

24:32.006 --> 24:34.206
and you never quit, no
matter how tough it gets.

24:34.208 --> 24:35.306
Understand?

24:35.308 --> 24:36.708
Yes, Coach.

24:36.710 --> 24:40.344
Good, my mailbox woke
me up in the middle

24:40.346 --> 24:41.412
of the night on Tuesday.

24:41.414 --> 24:43.350
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

24:44.852 --> 24:46.384
Nah, nah, no.

24:46.386 --> 24:47.287
No, that's good.

24:48.288 --> 24:50.022
But I will find out who did it.

24:50.024 --> 24:52.293
Meanwhile, get on the line,
you owe me three more laps.

24:53.827 --> 24:55.326
What?

24:55.328 --> 24:56.797
You owe me three more laps
from last week, remember?

24:57.430 --> 24:58.764
Let's go.

25:06.306 --> 25:07.406
You're thinking way too much

25:07.408 --> 25:10.175
about your technique,
Jay, relax.

25:10.177 --> 25:10.945
This isn't track.

25:13.413 --> 25:15.315
Try to run too
straight up and down.

25:20.220 --> 25:21.388
That's better.

25:27.193 --> 25:29.697
Relax your hands, too tight.

25:30.930 --> 25:31.732
Good.

25:34.401 --> 25:37.404
Gotta stop thinking, don't
think when you're running.

25:41.142 --> 25:42.073
There you go, that's better.

25:42.075 --> 25:43.508
That looks better.

25:43.510 --> 25:46.410
Remember this isn't
track, it's cross country.

25:54.455 --> 25:57.054
Get out of
my way, man, get off.

25:57.056 --> 26:02.063
So slow, get out the way.

26:06.901 --> 26:09.370
Oh, you're not about to beat me.

26:36.396 --> 26:38.198
Get outta my way, man.

26:42.603 --> 26:45.305
Hey, pace yourself
we're on the same team.

27:15.001 --> 27:16.601
I finally got that
horse smell off me.

27:16.603 --> 27:18.603
Yeah, it's not off, I can
smell it from over here.

27:18.605 --> 27:20.471
I mean at least he
doesn't look like his horse.

27:20.473 --> 27:22.442
You could be your
horse's twin brother.

27:24.944 --> 27:26.477
At least I live here
and wasn't sent here.

27:26.479 --> 27:27.545
All right, none of that.

27:27.547 --> 27:29.247
You don't know
anything about me.

27:29.249 --> 27:30.215
I don't belong here.

27:30.217 --> 27:32.016
That's what they all say.

27:32.018 --> 27:33.552
I don't belong here,
I didn't do anything.

27:33.554 --> 27:35.519
If you didn't do anything
then why are you here?

27:35.521 --> 27:36.588
You wanna start something?

27:36.590 --> 27:37.458
That's enough!

27:42.395 --> 27:45.499
I don't wanna hear this,
I don't want bickering.

27:46.600 --> 27:47.468
I want support.

27:50.904 --> 27:52.271
Dwight, you've been
here for two years.

27:52.273 --> 27:53.205
What are you talking about?

27:53.207 --> 27:54.409
You know better than that.

27:55.910 --> 27:57.512
That's not what
this place is about.

27:59.212 --> 28:01.913
If you guys put as much
energy into running

28:01.915 --> 28:04.551
as you do bickering with each
other, we might win a race.

28:10.658 --> 28:12.591
Speaking of which, this
scrimmage tomorrow,

28:12.593 --> 28:13.992
it's gonna be a challenge.

28:13.994 --> 28:16.495
It's 3.1 miles, and
it's against Brentmoor.

28:16.497 --> 28:17.729
Brentmoor.

28:17.731 --> 28:20.631
Yeah, Brentmoor High School,
defending AA state champions.

28:20.633 --> 28:21.499
Are they fast?

28:21.501 --> 28:22.634
Yeah, they're fast.

28:22.636 --> 28:25.373
They beat a couple of AAAA
teams outright last year.

28:26.973 --> 28:27.608
Good.

28:31.577 --> 28:32.679
I think we can beat 'em.

28:34.581 --> 28:36.985
In fact, I'm sure we can beat
them if we work as a team.

28:38.017 --> 28:39.887
But I can't tell
if we're a team.

28:40.621 --> 28:42.353
Are we a team?

28:42.355 --> 28:43.721
Yes, Coach.

28:43.723 --> 28:45.023
I didn't hear you.

28:45.025 --> 28:46.524
Yes, Coach.

28:46.526 --> 28:48.726
I didn't hear
Dwight, I didn't hear Jay.

28:48.728 --> 28:50.461
Are we a team?

28:50.463 --> 28:51.330
Yeah.

28:51.332 --> 28:52.166
Yeah.

28:53.267 --> 28:53.901
Yeah what?

28:55.702 --> 28:57.404
Yes, Coach.

29:00.641 --> 29:01.976
All right, let's eat.

29:02.742 --> 29:04.511
Who wants to lead us in prayer?

29:07.748 --> 29:09.616
- Why don't you go ahead, Will.
- Me?

29:13.620 --> 29:14.455
Jay, don't.

29:19.360 --> 29:22.430
Um, dear Lord, Willy here.

29:24.664 --> 29:26.163
Thanks, amen.

29:26.165 --> 29:27.000
Amen.

29:28.201 --> 29:30.569
Hey, you,
pass the crackers.

29:30.571 --> 29:31.769
Yeah, come
on, pass the crackers.

29:31.771 --> 29:33.738
Yeah, thanks.

29:39.479 --> 29:42.280
Who taught you to eat?

29:42.282 --> 29:43.715
I guess my dad.

29:43.717 --> 29:45.050
Well.

29:45.052 --> 29:46.752
He's a trucker.

29:46.754 --> 29:48.019
There's more
popcorn on the floor

29:48.021 --> 29:49.423
than in the bowl.

29:52.292 --> 29:55.663
Geez, the last time I
invite you to my house.

30:00.267 --> 30:01.302
Yo, Coach!

30:02.702 --> 30:03.901
Yo, Willy.

30:03.903 --> 30:07.007
Why you got this big house
and you live in this corner?

30:08.609 --> 30:09.674
Bring me
that box by your feet.

30:09.676 --> 30:10.609
Yeah, sure.

30:10.611 --> 30:11.612
Don't look inside.

30:14.815 --> 30:19.784
I told you not to
look inside, didn't I?

30:19.786 --> 30:22.387
All right, it's official now.

30:22.389 --> 30:23.391
Ah, sweet!

30:25.691 --> 30:27.027
What are these?

30:28.128 --> 30:28.730
William.

30:30.797 --> 30:32.130
Aw, dude,
it even smells good.

30:32.132 --> 30:33.401
Ha, got it.

30:34.668 --> 30:36.067
Represent.

30:36.069 --> 30:37.636
Yeah, we need
to change that word.

30:37.638 --> 30:38.669
I can help you.

30:39.605 --> 30:41.473
Three, four, five.

30:41.475 --> 30:44.012
One, two, three, four, five.

31:00.661 --> 31:02.130
Go take your warmup.

31:04.297 --> 31:05.563
Coach, how you doing?

31:05.565 --> 31:06.665
Good, and you?

31:06.667 --> 31:07.631
I'm good.

31:07.633 --> 31:08.699
Hey, boys, you all go warm up.

31:08.701 --> 31:09.503
Yes, sir.

31:10.403 --> 31:11.602
Hey, did you get my offer?

31:11.604 --> 31:13.237
I did, I did.

31:13.239 --> 31:15.107
Wow, it's really
generous, thank you.

31:15.109 --> 31:17.508
There's a lotta guys
interested in this job,

31:17.510 --> 31:18.810
but I want you.

31:18.812 --> 31:20.579
You know, make that call.

31:20.581 --> 31:21.813
Well, I certainly
am flattered.

31:21.815 --> 31:22.781
Thank you very much.

31:22.783 --> 31:23.715
Well, let's get after it.

31:23.717 --> 31:25.249
Okay, let's do it.

31:25.251 --> 31:26.517
- All right.
- See you down there. Set.

31:45.238 --> 31:46.737
Oh, you gonna sprint this out?

31:46.739 --> 31:49.640
Jay, pace yourself.

31:49.642 --> 31:51.078
Good luck, buddy.

32:49.369 --> 32:50.771
Come on,
come on, come on.

32:51.771 --> 32:53.206
What are you doing?

32:56.677 --> 32:57.812
Get away from me, ugh!

33:14.260 --> 33:16.527
I'm sorry is the
finish line right there?

33:16.529 --> 33:18.362
Where's the finish line?

33:18.364 --> 33:19.531
Dwight, where's the finish line?

33:19.533 --> 33:20.599
Come on.

33:20.601 --> 33:22.266
Why did you not run
through it? Are you injured?

33:22.268 --> 33:22.900
Did you not see what
happened back there?

33:22.902 --> 33:24.669
Yes, you quit running!

33:24.671 --> 33:26.004
I tripped, he tripped me!

33:26.006 --> 33:28.439
Oh, well, gosh I hope you
don't trip in a real race

33:28.441 --> 33:30.842
because then we'll just
give up, how 'bout that?

33:30.844 --> 33:32.811
Hit the showers, you too.

33:32.813 --> 33:34.916
Why don't you run
back to the showers?

33:36.482 --> 33:37.317
Hustle!

33:44.924 --> 33:46.024
Okay, guys, we've
got a long way to go

33:46.026 --> 33:49.326
before we can compete with
schools like Brentmoor.

33:49.328 --> 33:50.996
They're experienced,
they're focused,

33:50.998 --> 33:52.831
and they're very well coached.

33:52.833 --> 33:54.869
Are they as well
coached as we are?

33:55.835 --> 33:57.904
And they don't beat
themselves, Dwight.

33:59.506 --> 34:00.471
All right, let's warm up.

34:00.473 --> 34:01.672
One lap around the pond,

34:01.674 --> 34:03.007
and then we're gonna
do some drills.

34:03.009 --> 34:04.211
Let's go, get at it.

34:05.411 --> 34:06.680
Jay, Dwight, come here.

34:12.918 --> 34:14.018
I don't know what's
going on with you two,

34:14.020 --> 34:16.053
but it gets worked out today.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.554
We're gonna win, we're
gonna win as a team.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.725
It means out there, we gotta
have each other's backs.

34:20.726 --> 34:22.360
So get up there and work it out.

34:22.362 --> 34:23.264
Up where?

34:28.969 --> 34:33.007
Finally, dude.
man, this is fun.

34:35.775 --> 34:37.574
No, I like it up here.

34:37.576 --> 34:38.877
Hey, maybe you should
ruin our meets more often,

34:38.879 --> 34:40.281
so we can come out here.

34:41.647 --> 34:43.514
Aw, what, you silent now?

34:43.516 --> 34:44.716
Are you just mad 'cause
I'm faster than you?

34:44.717 --> 34:46.984
In fact, next meet, I'm
gonna run backwards,

34:46.985 --> 34:48.819
so I can beat you while
running backwards.

34:48.821 --> 34:49.920
Oh, hold up, nah,
I'm not gonna do that

34:49.922 --> 34:52.525
'cause I don't wanna see
your ugly face when I win.

34:53.960 --> 34:54.926
Get out
here to the middle,

34:54.928 --> 34:56.527
and let's get this over with.

34:56.529 --> 34:57.897
I'm coming, come now.

34:59.765 --> 35:00.968
All right, help me across.

35:02.502 --> 35:05.969
Come on, hey.

35:05.971 --> 35:06.804
Hey, man, what you doin'?

35:06.806 --> 35:08.038
What you doin'?

35:08.040 --> 35:09.406
I'm not doing anything.

35:09.408 --> 35:10.475
Yeah, you are, you're
shaking the pole.

35:10.477 --> 35:11.676
I'm not shaking the pole.

35:11.678 --> 35:13.712
That's exactly
what you're doing.

35:13.714 --> 35:14.846
You have to lean back more.

35:14.848 --> 35:15.983
I'm leaning, I'm leaning.

35:17.350 --> 35:19.953
Oh, geez, you're face
is even uglier up close.

35:22.455 --> 35:23.955
Hey, Dwight, what was that?

35:25.091 --> 35:26.294
Coach, this guy's crazy.

35:32.899 --> 35:33.797
Mom, what is
coach's problem with me?

35:33.799 --> 35:36.400
What do you mean,
did something happen?

35:36.402 --> 35:38.103
I do exactly what
he wants me to do,

35:38.105 --> 35:38.971
but that's never good enough.

35:38.973 --> 35:41.038
He cuts Willy and
Jay so much slack.

35:41.040 --> 35:43.475
I feel like I'd be better off
if I had gotten in trouble.

35:43.477 --> 35:45.109
Hey, I don't wanna
hear you talk like that.

35:45.111 --> 35:45.944
Too bad.

35:45.946 --> 35:46.777
Dwight.

35:46.779 --> 35:47.614
I'm done!

35:48.614 --> 35:49.450
Dwight!

35:59.993 --> 36:01.558
Hi, Debra, how are you?

36:01.560 --> 36:03.627
- What's going on?
- What's going on with what?

36:03.629 --> 36:05.096
Dwight's upset.

36:05.098 --> 36:06.563
And I know him well enough

36:06.565 --> 36:07.732
to believe there's a
good reason for it.

36:07.734 --> 36:09.768
Well, I understand
your concern,

36:09.770 --> 36:10.667
but can we talk about
it at a different time--

36:10.669 --> 36:11.870
No, we can't, Mitch.

36:11.872 --> 36:13.074
- Now is not a very good--
- No!

36:14.507 --> 36:16.042
It's gonna be fine.

36:21.948 --> 36:24.681
Runners set, go.

36:24.683 --> 36:27.587
Oh, yeah, exactly.

36:29.022 --> 36:30.524
Now,
stay on lane one.

38:13.527 --> 38:14.826
By the way, Sarah wanted me

38:14.828 --> 38:16.596
to invite you to dinner tonight.

38:17.964 --> 38:19.129
Tonight?

38:19.131 --> 38:20.166
I'm there.

38:21.134 --> 38:23.671
We were also thinking
about inviting Debra.

38:26.105 --> 38:27.174
Absolutely not.

38:29.542 --> 38:30.977
It's been five years, Mitch.

38:33.113 --> 38:35.114
So five is the magic number?

38:36.683 --> 38:39.683
I didn't know there was a
statute of limitations on grief.

38:39.685 --> 38:40.988
You're right, I'm sorry.

38:45.591 --> 38:46.660
So, big day tomorrow.

38:47.727 --> 38:49.029
It's the interview, right?

38:50.730 --> 38:53.033
Ah, I'm just gonna
test the waters.

38:54.667 --> 38:57.234
Mitch, I've known
you a long time.

38:57.236 --> 39:00.039
If you're going, it's more
than just testing waters.

39:01.575 --> 39:03.277
Well, why shouldn't
I go down there?

39:05.712 --> 39:06.881
I deserve to be happy.

39:09.015 --> 39:13.283
And these kids, every
year there's a new crop,

39:13.285 --> 39:15.185
and you and I both know
that they need our help,

39:15.187 --> 39:16.956
but none of them
actually want it.

39:19.993 --> 39:21.960
I'm sick of it.

39:21.962 --> 39:22.830
I'm sick of them.

40:19.152 --> 40:20.588
Idiot.

40:23.857 --> 40:24.959
Where's Willy?

40:26.225 --> 40:27.357
He's not here.

40:27.359 --> 40:29.095
No
kidding, where is he?

40:30.363 --> 40:31.198
He quit.

40:32.297 --> 40:33.633
Did he tell you that?

40:35.035 --> 40:35.835
Yeah.

40:40.040 --> 40:45.045
Okay.

41:19.011 --> 41:19.879
Hey, Jeremy.

41:21.281 --> 41:22.913
How you feeling?

41:22.915 --> 41:23.748
A little nervous.

41:23.750 --> 41:25.783
Yeah, so am I.

41:25.785 --> 41:27.317
So is everyone else.

41:27.319 --> 41:30.087
Listen, this course
is built for you.

41:30.089 --> 41:32.422
It's flat, everything
we worked on together.

41:32.424 --> 41:33.257
It's gonna work out for you here

41:33.259 --> 41:35.192
if you just trust
yourself, okay?

41:35.194 --> 41:36.127
All right.

41:36.129 --> 41:36.928
All right, go get 'em.

41:36.930 --> 41:37.761
Thanks, Coach.

41:37.763 --> 41:38.462
Mm hmm.

43:36.850 --> 43:38.786
I love you, Jeremy.

44:44.484 --> 44:46.516
I knew this
place was stupid.

44:46.518 --> 44:48.551
Stop it, Willy.

44:48.553 --> 44:49.987
Stupid Boys Ranch.

44:49.989 --> 44:51.355
Shut up, this
place saved my life!

44:51.357 --> 44:53.259
Yeah, well, it ruined mine.

44:55.395 --> 44:56.230
There they are.

44:58.364 --> 45:01.431
Hey, Willy, we won
second, silver medal, baby!

45:01.433 --> 45:05.004
You would've gotten
first if I was there.

45:06.138 --> 45:07.573
Willy!

45:12.712 --> 45:13.547
Willy!

45:15.948 --> 45:17.383
Willy!

45:23.256 --> 45:26.125
Hey, Willy, get over here now.

45:31.029 --> 45:32.263
What's going on,
what happened to you?

45:32.265 --> 45:34.632
Seriously, I'm just
making it easy for you.

45:34.634 --> 45:35.665
Easy for what?

45:35.667 --> 45:37.400
Quitting.

45:37.402 --> 45:38.703
Quitting.

45:38.705 --> 45:40.004
Man, I heard you.

45:40.006 --> 45:41.739
I know you're
taking another job.

45:41.741 --> 45:42.672
I know you're sick
of this place,

45:42.674 --> 45:45.208
sick of me, sick of all of us.

45:45.210 --> 45:46.476
Sorry you had to deal me.

45:46.478 --> 45:48.015
Hey, wait, don't
walk away from me.

45:53.652 --> 45:55.656
I didn't know you
heard that, I'm sorry.

45:58.190 --> 46:01.391
You did hear right,
I am considering another job next year.

46:01.393 --> 46:03.661
This year, right now,
I've got this job,

46:03.663 --> 46:05.096
and I'm gonna finish it.

46:05.098 --> 46:06.464
That has nothing to
do with quitting.

46:06.466 --> 46:07.301
Man, whatever.

46:08.468 --> 46:11.171
I've never quit anything
that I've started before, ever.

46:12.372 --> 46:13.707
Can you say the same thing?

46:16.609 --> 46:18.241
Is this how you're
gonna live your life

46:18.243 --> 46:20.143
anytime someone says
something you don't like?

46:20.145 --> 46:21.612
Anytime someone offends you,

46:21.614 --> 46:25.252
you're just gonna say I'm,
I'm out, I'm finished?

46:28.053 --> 46:30.623
'Cause it's gonna happen a lot
in life, I'll tell you that.

46:32.457 --> 46:34.360
Have people quit on you before?

46:37.096 --> 46:40.196
I think they have, but
I'm here to tell you

46:40.198 --> 46:42.668
that I am never gonna
quit on you, ever.

46:44.337 --> 46:46.006
Man, I don't care.

46:46.705 --> 46:47.707
Don't you?

46:49.075 --> 46:51.174
Why'd you paint that wall then?

46:51.176 --> 46:52.777
Man, you think an
awful lot of yourself.

46:52.779 --> 46:56.216
I tagged 57 walls in L.A.,
was that all about you, too?

46:58.817 --> 46:59.652
No.

47:02.654 --> 47:04.591
No, that's about you.

47:14.767 --> 47:17.435
Mr. Tibbe, this
is Debra Everett.

47:17.437 --> 47:20.603
And, uh, I know that you've
been missing your appointments.

47:20.605 --> 47:22.806
If there is anything that
we can do to help you,

47:22.808 --> 47:24.143
will you please call me.

47:34.786 --> 47:38.091
Hey, Dad, did you
get that picture I sent?

47:39.859 --> 47:41.424
I wish you would call me.

47:41.426 --> 47:43.661
I mean, maybe you have
called and I missed it.

47:43.663 --> 47:46.230
You could email too, but
probably can't figure out

47:46.232 --> 47:47.300
how to work the computer.

47:49.167 --> 47:51.669
Anyway, Ms. DeMarco says I
should mail you a letter,

47:51.671 --> 47:53.707
so, uh, here it is.

47:55.674 --> 47:57.274
I'm doing all these
stupid activities

47:57.276 --> 47:59.609
to keep me from
dying of boredom.

47:59.611 --> 48:01.712
I mean, I'm so far ahead
of the students here,

48:01.714 --> 48:04.084
I rarely make it to class on
time. I mean, why should I?

48:06.185 --> 48:08.886
Ms. Everett signed me up
for some science club.

48:08.888 --> 48:10.323
It's probably boring too.

48:11.823 --> 48:13.759
I know I made it hard
on you sometimes,

48:14.727 --> 48:16.495
I guess hard on myself, too.

48:17.562 --> 48:21.267
But don't give up on me.

48:25.471 --> 48:27.337
Anyway, I wish you were here.

48:27.339 --> 48:29.542
Drive safe, love you.

49:33.306 --> 49:35.272
Does this rocket work?

49:35.274 --> 49:36.774
Of course it works.

49:36.776 --> 49:37.775
How high does it go?

49:37.777 --> 49:39.246
18,000 feet.

49:40.846 --> 49:41.681
What?

49:42.814 --> 49:43.649
What?

49:53.859 --> 49:55.525
Yep.

49:55.527 --> 49:57.328
I heard you're not going
to the rocket launch.

49:57.330 --> 49:59.533
Oh yeah, who'd you
hear that from, Debra?

50:02.634 --> 50:03.567
Hey, check this out.

50:03.569 --> 50:05.805
It's the offer from Brentmoor.

50:08.573 --> 50:09.473
That's a lot of money.

50:09.475 --> 50:10.310
I know.

50:13.478 --> 50:14.978
You never cared
about the money before.

50:14.980 --> 50:17.748
Well, I've never been
offered that much before.

50:17.750 --> 50:18.852
Sounds like a done deal.

50:22.421 --> 50:23.920
What?

50:23.922 --> 50:25.422
I didn't say anything.

50:25.424 --> 50:26.656
Yeah, I know you
didn't say anything,

50:26.658 --> 50:27.857
but I know you too well.

50:27.859 --> 50:28.759
Just because you
don't say anything,

50:28.761 --> 50:30.393
doesn't mean you
don't have an opinion.

50:31.631 --> 50:32.464
What?

50:33.966 --> 50:35.632
I'm asking you.

50:35.634 --> 50:37.337
Well, if you're
asking me, okay.

50:38.803 --> 50:40.839
I think you're wrong about
the kids, and you know it.

50:41.906 --> 50:43.809
They do want our help, Mitch.

50:44.843 --> 50:47.246
Yes, we lose some, and it hurts.

50:48.580 --> 50:51.348
But Jesus said in
the book of Matthew,

50:51.350 --> 50:53.850
"A shepherd that
has a hundred sheep,

50:53.852 --> 50:57.855
if one goes astray,
he'll leave the 99

50:57.857 --> 50:59.793
and go after the
one that got lost."

51:00.960 --> 51:02.596
That's what we do.

51:06.431 --> 51:08.799
And again, since you're asking,

51:08.801 --> 51:10.500
I think you're lost.

51:10.502 --> 51:12.603
I think you're living in fear.

51:12.605 --> 51:14.605
Now if you're too blind to see
what's right in front of you,

51:14.607 --> 51:16.643
if you have lost that ability,

51:17.810 --> 51:22.782
then yes, maybe you
need to move on.

51:26.419 --> 51:28.788
Well, that's the last time
I ask you for your opinion.

52:45.931 --> 52:47.000
Do you ever lose faith?

52:49.801 --> 52:52.037
Faith, you mean faith in God?

52:53.872 --> 52:57.808
No, I mean faith in
the work you're doing.

52:57.810 --> 52:59.712
Faith in this place?

53:00.846 --> 53:02.949
Faith in people, I guess
that's what I mean.

53:04.183 --> 53:09.355
Well, I would consider
a loss of faith in people

53:11.457 --> 53:13.625
equivalent to a loss
of faith in myself,

53:15.127 --> 53:16.129
and in God.

53:19.464 --> 53:24.136
I believe in the inherent
good in all people.

53:25.504 --> 53:27.973
It's just an expression
of the love of God.

53:29.442 --> 53:32.978
And everything else, all the
shakenings and the doubts?

53:33.978 --> 53:35.582
They're just tests of that love.

53:37.616 --> 53:40.987
Yeah, I just feel like, uh,

53:45.056 --> 53:48.558
I feel like I'm failing
all the test, you know?

53:48.560 --> 53:51.096
Well, welcome
to the party, we all do.

53:54.799 --> 53:57.100
Mitch, everything you do here,

53:57.102 --> 53:59.705
it means everything
to these kids.

54:02.006 --> 54:04.042
Well, I hope you're
right, I really do.

54:07.212 --> 54:09.145
So how's things
going with you and Debra?

54:09.147 --> 54:12.082
Mitch: I have faith in it.

54:12.084 --> 54:13.116
You have faith?

54:21.660 --> 54:22.493
Hi, there.

54:22.495 --> 54:23.226
Hey.

54:23.228 --> 54:25.495
Hey, is Dwight here?

54:25.497 --> 54:26.897
I'd like to speak
to him, if I could.

54:26.899 --> 54:28.130
Yeah, come on in.

54:28.132 --> 54:29.134
Thanks.

54:34.138 --> 54:36.707
Come in.

54:36.709 --> 54:37.509
Hey, Dwight.

54:39.745 --> 54:40.580
How are you?

54:43.248 --> 54:44.884
Can I talk to you a second?

54:50.589 --> 54:51.955
Talk.

54:51.957 --> 54:56.025
Well, I tell you've,
uh, you've noticed

54:56.027 --> 55:00.096
that I have not been the
best coach this year.

55:00.098 --> 55:04.571
And I need help, sometimes
even coaches need help.

55:05.770 --> 55:07.203
I was wondering if you
could do me the favor

55:07.205 --> 55:09.640
of helping me out with the team?

55:09.642 --> 55:12.308
You know, um, maybe
you could run some

55:12.310 --> 55:15.113
of the captain's
practices yourself?

55:18.116 --> 55:19.583
Take the roll of a leader,

55:19.585 --> 55:22.489
even a bigger leader
than you already are.

55:24.790 --> 55:26.255
Why me?

55:26.257 --> 55:28.257
Well, you have
the most experience,

55:28.259 --> 55:30.893
you know the terrain
better than anybody,

55:30.895 --> 55:35.265
and frankly, you require
the least amount of coaching

55:35.267 --> 55:38.136
of anybody on and
off the course.

55:41.006 --> 55:41.841
What do you say?

55:45.210 --> 55:46.246
Okay.

55:47.212 --> 55:48.745
- Yeah?
- You got it, Coach.

55:48.747 --> 55:50.013
Great.

55:50.015 --> 55:52.248
And a great favor
to me, thank you.

55:52.250 --> 55:55.687
You could also, you know,
help out with the laundry.

55:56.689 --> 55:57.723
I'm kidding.

55:58.756 --> 55:59.790
I'll see you.

56:02.995 --> 56:03.830
Thanks, Mitch.

56:04.897 --> 56:05.998
I know he needed that.

56:07.232 --> 56:08.668
Were you eavesdropping?

56:09.835 --> 56:11.100
He is
my son, you know.

56:11.102 --> 56:12.969
Mitch: He's a great kid.

56:12.971 --> 56:13.904
Yeah, he is.

56:13.906 --> 56:15.071
I needed it too.

56:15.073 --> 56:15.908
Good.

56:17.875 --> 56:18.710
Yeah.

56:21.013 --> 56:24.681
I, uh, oh, well.

56:24.683 --> 56:25.781
I'll, I'll see you.

56:25.783 --> 56:26.417
Okay.

56:30.221 --> 56:31.723
You going to the rocket launch?

56:33.192 --> 56:36.292
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I wouldn't miss it.

56:36.294 --> 56:38.127
Good, I'll see you there.

56:38.129 --> 56:39.629
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.

56:39.631 --> 56:40.265
Bye.

56:49.174 --> 56:51.311
That's 2:20 right there.

56:52.343 --> 56:54.011
That's a good job,

56:54.013 --> 56:56.212
that's an improvement
from last time, isn't it?

56:56.214 --> 57:00.216
Well done, it's a good pace.

57:00.218 --> 57:02.921
Good effort, guys, keep it up.

57:06.959 --> 57:07.794
What's up?

59:07.513 --> 59:09.716
This is gonna be cool.

59:10.848 --> 59:12.549
That's it,
you got it turned on.

59:12.551 --> 59:14.484
Insert tiny screws.

59:14.486 --> 59:15.986
Pretty
boring this weekend.

59:15.988 --> 59:17.120
Yeah.

59:17.122 --> 59:19.054
You gonna do
anything next weekend?

59:19.056 --> 59:21.091
I don't know.

59:21.093 --> 59:23.159
Now let's get
the radio tuned in.

59:23.161 --> 59:25.395
I don't
plan ahead much.

59:25.397 --> 59:26.996
Take this out.

59:26.998 --> 59:28.565
And we've got a beacon
inside the nose cone.

59:28.567 --> 59:30.103
Oh, do you like rockets?

59:31.303 --> 59:33.270
Yeah, what about you?

59:33.272 --> 59:34.306
Sure, yeah.

59:37.209 --> 59:38.877
Okay, rocket's
ready to launch, Charlie.

59:40.011 --> 59:42.981
Five, four,
three, two, one.

01:00:15.214 --> 01:00:18.147
I'm sorry, I'm
not very good at this.

01:00:18.149 --> 01:00:19.382
At what?

01:00:19.384 --> 01:00:23.486
Just sitting still
without, you know,

01:00:23.488 --> 01:00:28.326
filling the space with
words or, or movement.

01:00:31.395 --> 01:00:33.362
Would you rather go
for a walk instead?

01:00:33.364 --> 01:00:35.065
No, no, no.

01:00:35.067 --> 01:00:38.935
I think being still is
not gonna hurt me, right?

01:00:38.937 --> 01:00:40.573
No, not at all.

01:00:46.544 --> 01:00:48.814
It's totally
exhausting though.

01:00:55.553 --> 01:00:58.456
You know, there's nothing
that you have to do,

01:00:59.924 --> 01:01:02.961
nothing you have to
accomplish, not right now.

01:01:04.363 --> 01:01:06.399
And especially, not with me.

01:01:13.906 --> 01:01:14.873
Thank you.

01:01:18.609 --> 01:01:20.210
Right now you're running
like you've been told

01:01:20.212 --> 01:01:22.978
one too many times to
keep your chest out

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:24.614
and your head over your hips.

01:01:24.616 --> 01:01:26.650
Those are all fine
things, good cues,

01:01:26.652 --> 01:01:29.451
but nobody runs straight
up and down, 'kay?

01:01:29.453 --> 01:01:31.487
You look fine, I just want
you to relax a little bit.

01:01:31.489 --> 01:01:34.093
Mitch, can I see you a second?

01:01:41.065 --> 01:01:44.502
Man, I don't think
we're gonna be cool.

01:01:51.143 --> 01:01:56.148
Jeremy, why don't
you go talk to the chaplain.

01:01:59.584 --> 01:02:00.583
Go join the others.

01:02:00.585 --> 01:02:02.018
Coach, what happened?

01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:03.222
Just go ahead.

01:02:09.361 --> 01:02:11.027
What's up?

01:02:11.029 --> 01:02:13.529
Look son, there's
no easy way to tell you this,

01:02:13.531 --> 01:02:15.367
but I'm sorry, look.

01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:30.315
This is how you
answer my prayers?

01:02:31.549 --> 01:02:34.083
All I've asked for is for
you to take care of her,

01:02:34.085 --> 01:02:35.654
and this is what you do?

01:02:37.055 --> 01:02:40.690
Jeremy, look, I know it
doesn't make sense sometimes.

01:02:40.692 --> 01:02:42.391
I didn't come
here for a sermon.

01:02:42.393 --> 01:02:43.625
Okay, if that's what
you're here to do,

01:02:43.627 --> 01:02:45.562
then you can take these back.

01:02:48.299 --> 01:02:49.935
I didn't come
to preach at you.

01:02:53.105 --> 01:02:54.307
I came to say I'm sorry.

01:02:56.174 --> 01:02:57.276
Yeah, I'm sorry too.

01:02:58.743 --> 01:03:03.448
I'm sorry my mom was an
alcoholic and a crackhead.

01:03:05.649 --> 01:03:08.384
I'm sorry she thought
a car was a good home.

01:03:08.386 --> 01:03:11.056
And that it was okay to get
dinner out of a trashcan.

01:03:46.158 --> 01:03:51.161
Hey, dad, I mean,
um, Mr. Harris.

01:03:51.163 --> 01:03:52.694
What
can I do for you, Jeremy?

01:03:52.696 --> 01:03:56.001
Um, I'm just calling
to let you know that, um,

01:03:57.636 --> 01:04:02.208
mom died today, just
thought you should know.

01:04:03.607 --> 01:04:05.641
I'm sorry to hear that,
but I'm not surprised.

01:04:05.643 --> 01:04:10.448
She had a, I guess you could
say she had a hard life.

01:04:14.652 --> 01:04:16.689
So you
live in Chicago?

01:04:17.855 --> 01:04:18.690
I do.

01:04:20.357 --> 01:04:21.690
So what do you do.

01:04:22.593 --> 01:04:25.594
Look, Jeremy, I'm
sorry about your mom,

01:04:25.596 --> 01:04:28.498
but I gotta go, good luck.

01:04:54.859 --> 01:04:56.859
All right,
listen up guys.

01:04:56.861 --> 01:04:58.527
We've been to the
Lubbock regions before,

01:04:58.529 --> 01:04:59.596
you know how it works.

01:04:59.598 --> 01:05:01.563
It's a little warm today,
but that's all right.

01:05:01.565 --> 01:05:03.333
We've got the Falcons coming,

01:05:03.335 --> 01:05:04.299
they're on the up and coming,

01:05:04.301 --> 01:05:05.738
but that's all right.

01:05:08.239 --> 01:05:10.873
Rough Riders, we
know about them.

01:05:10.875 --> 01:05:11.841
Hey, I need to
talk to that coach.

01:05:11.843 --> 01:05:14.212
Hey, you guys warm up
for a minute, all right?

01:05:15.881 --> 01:05:16.714
Coach!

01:05:18.716 --> 01:05:19.551
Be right back.

01:05:22.486 --> 01:05:23.419
Hey, how are you?

01:05:23.421 --> 01:05:24.254
Good.

01:05:24.256 --> 01:05:25.487
Good.

01:05:25.489 --> 01:05:26.623
Congratulations
on your season,

01:05:26.625 --> 01:05:28.690
you've made something out
of nothing one more time.

01:05:28.692 --> 01:05:29.759
Thanks.

01:05:29.761 --> 01:05:30.859
Hey, give us a call.

01:05:30.861 --> 01:05:33.198
Yep, that's the guy that's
trying to steal coach.

01:05:34.933 --> 01:05:36.266
Coach wouldn't leave.

01:05:36.268 --> 01:05:37.779
Money changes
a lot of things.

01:06:11.723 --> 01:06:13.726
Yo, D, check it
out, it's team orphan.

01:06:14.859 --> 01:06:16.661
Hey, hey, it's
boy's camp, right?

01:06:17.561 --> 01:06:18.828
It's Boys Ranch

01:06:18.830 --> 01:06:20.395
All right, same
thing, whatever.

01:06:20.397 --> 01:06:22.065
Is it true what they
say about you guys?

01:06:22.067 --> 01:06:24.567
That Father's Day is the
hardest time of the year

01:06:24.569 --> 01:06:26.804
'cause none of you know
who your parents are?

01:06:28.005 --> 01:06:28.906
You got a problem?

01:06:31.076 --> 01:06:32.478
Got something to say, tough guy?

01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:34.513
Say it, tough guy.

01:06:36.081 --> 01:06:38.047
Yeah, that's what I thought.

01:06:42.087 --> 01:06:43.052
I will destroy you!

01:06:43.054 --> 01:06:43.954
Jeremy, calm
down, hey, calm down.

01:06:43.956 --> 01:06:46.355
Save it
for the race, Jeremy.

01:06:46.357 --> 01:06:48.090
Jeremy,
what's going on?

01:06:48.092 --> 01:06:49.025
Hey!

01:06:49.027 --> 01:06:49.826
I'm outta here.

01:06:49.828 --> 01:06:50.625
Jeremy!

01:06:50.627 --> 01:06:51.561
It wasn't his fault.

01:06:51.563 --> 01:06:53.061
What wasn't is fault?

01:06:53.063 --> 01:06:53.996
- It was that Brentmoor kid.
- He was standing up for him.

01:06:53.998 --> 01:06:54.931
He was only standing up for Jay.

01:06:54.933 --> 01:06:55.732
He was talking trash.

01:06:55.734 --> 01:06:56.866
What happened?

01:06:56.868 --> 01:06:57.532
Jeremy
punched him in the face.

01:06:57.534 --> 01:06:59.034
Jeez.

01:06:59.036 --> 01:07:00.869
Come here, come on.

01:07:00.871 --> 01:07:01.704
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:07:01.706 --> 01:07:02.871
your attention please.

01:07:02.873 --> 01:07:07.409
Boys Ranch competitor number
1351 has been disqualified

01:07:07.411 --> 01:07:09.811
for unsportsmanlike conduct.

01:07:15.719 --> 01:07:16.788
Chad, pace.

01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:38.944
All right boys, come on.

01:09:20.911 --> 01:09:21.844
According
to your grandma,

01:09:21.845 --> 01:09:24.046
you quit everything you do.

01:09:24.048 --> 01:09:25.050
You always give up.

01:09:26.116 --> 01:09:28.185
This how you're gonna live
the rest of your life?

01:09:48.606 --> 01:09:49.774
Go Jay, go!

01:10:34.686 --> 01:10:35.587
It's Boys Ranch!

01:11:17.794 --> 01:11:19.730
Coach Andrews, hey, uh,

01:11:20.865 --> 01:11:23.299
what was all that
stuff before the race?

01:11:23.301 --> 01:11:24.434
We're just playing
by the rules, Coach.

01:11:24.436 --> 01:11:27.235
I mean, what your boy said
to mine before the race?

01:11:27.237 --> 01:11:28.304
Did you hear it?

01:11:28.306 --> 01:11:29.704
Yeah, I heard it.

01:11:29.706 --> 01:11:30.976
Boys will be boys.

01:11:32.176 --> 01:11:33.876
So you approve of
that sort of thing?

01:11:33.878 --> 01:11:35.711
I approve of winning.

01:11:35.713 --> 01:11:37.212
If you don't wanna
win as bad I do,

01:11:37.214 --> 01:11:39.817
maybe working together is
not such a good idea, Davis.

01:11:41.285 --> 01:11:43.051
It sounds like maybe you
and I have a different idea

01:11:43.053 --> 01:11:43.955
of what winning is.

01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:48.056
Well, maybe we do.

01:11:48.058 --> 01:11:50.225
Well, this is life in
the fast lane, Coach.

01:11:50.227 --> 01:11:51.730
You're either in or you're out.

01:11:53.964 --> 01:11:55.132
I'll see you at state.

01:11:56.133 --> 01:11:57.201
This year and next.

01:11:59.169 --> 01:12:01.836
All right, look
at you guys, huh?

01:12:01.838 --> 01:12:02.938
How you feeling?

01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:04.372
Thank you.

01:12:04.374 --> 01:12:05.875
Well, done, that's a
great effort, great effort.

01:12:05.877 --> 01:12:07.009
Look at you, huh?

01:12:07.011 --> 01:12:08.411
Well done.

01:12:08.413 --> 01:12:09.982
Woo, how you feeling?

01:12:11.382 --> 01:12:13.948
Guys , all right,
let's get on the bus.

01:12:13.950 --> 01:12:18.389
Hey, hey Coach, I blew
up your mailbox, sorry.

01:12:20.157 --> 01:12:21.793
I know, come on, let's go.

01:12:25.396 --> 01:12:26.761
Whoa, come on, guys,

01:12:26.763 --> 01:12:27.930
that's what I'm talkin' about.

01:12:27.932 --> 01:12:29.331
Good job, bubba.

01:12:29.333 --> 01:12:30.302
Thanks, man.

01:12:34.237 --> 01:12:36.305
Just gonna
leave me hangin'?

01:12:48.186 --> 01:12:51.921
Hey, man, I just,
uh, wanna say thanks

01:12:51.923 --> 01:12:53.788
for gettin' my back today.

01:12:53.790 --> 01:12:56.027
Dude, Jeremy did
most of the work.

01:12:58.862 --> 01:13:01.298
Hey, Jeremy, thanks, man.

01:13:12.477 --> 01:13:15.914
Hey, Jay, how's that
personal best feel?

01:13:16.813 --> 01:13:18.083
Feels good, I just, uh,

01:13:19.249 --> 01:13:20.985
kinda wish my dad
was here to see it.

01:13:22.853 --> 01:13:23.688
Yeah, so do I.

01:15:11.262 --> 01:15:13.394
Man, this
stop sign again?

01:15:13.396 --> 01:15:15.430
This stop sign is stupid.

01:15:15.432 --> 01:15:16.498
It's
not stupid to me.

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:19.501
My mother had me when she
was 15, and here I am.

01:15:19.503 --> 01:15:21.470
I like the stop sign.

01:15:21.472 --> 01:15:25.477
Oh, I'm, I'm sorry, I
didn't know, I'm sorry.

01:15:28.545 --> 01:15:31.247
I'm leaving in
two weeks, Willy.

01:15:31.249 --> 01:15:34.315
What, why, where
are you going?

01:15:34.317 --> 01:15:36.150
My mother wants me back.

01:15:36.152 --> 01:15:37.351
We're moving to St. Louis,

01:15:37.353 --> 01:15:41.390
or outside of St. Louis, but
we Skyped for like two hours.

01:15:41.392 --> 01:15:43.028
And how is this good news?

01:15:44.128 --> 01:15:45.429
Aren't you happy for me?

01:15:47.231 --> 01:15:48.596
Happy for you?

01:15:48.598 --> 01:15:51.033
Why does everybody
have to do this to me?

01:15:51.035 --> 01:15:52.268
I'll still
be here for state.

01:15:52.270 --> 01:15:53.605
I can still see you run.

01:15:56.606 --> 01:15:58.209
I'm not running anymore.

01:15:59.643 --> 01:16:01.146
I was only running for you.

01:16:27.637 --> 01:16:29.671
Father, bless this food.

01:16:29.673 --> 01:16:31.674
Thank you for the
nourishment it provides.

01:16:31.676 --> 01:16:33.475
As we enjoy this meal and after,

01:16:33.477 --> 01:16:36.381
help us to be mindful of
the needs of others, amen.

01:17:21.525 --> 01:17:24.228
Do you know what one of your
best qualities is, Jeremy?

01:17:25.463 --> 01:17:27.432
You always try to
do the right thing.

01:17:31.602 --> 01:17:34.306
I didn't do the right thing.

01:17:35.638 --> 01:17:37.409
No, no, you didn't.

01:17:40.643 --> 01:17:44.648
And though I admire your courage,
I can't condone violence.

01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:49.286
It's a path that leads
to pain and unhappiness.

01:17:52.589 --> 01:17:54.292
I think you've had
enough of both.

01:18:02.633 --> 01:18:05.136
I could've kept hitting him.

01:18:06.102 --> 01:18:07.571
I wanted to keep hitting him.

01:18:10.708 --> 01:18:13.044
If they hadn't pulled
me off, I would have.

01:18:17.248 --> 01:18:18.083
It scared me.

01:18:19.417 --> 01:18:21.315
It should scare you.

01:18:21.317 --> 01:18:23.521
I don't see myself
that way, Chaplain.

01:18:24.588 --> 01:18:26.191
That's the flesh in all of us.

01:18:28.058 --> 01:18:31.663
And we could feed it
with anger and fear,

01:18:32.730 --> 01:18:35.600
or we can quench it with
love and compassion,

01:18:37.168 --> 01:18:37.768
but it's there.

01:18:39.803 --> 01:18:40.771
Is it in you too?

01:18:44.741 --> 01:18:46.511
We're all made
of the same stuff,

01:18:49.213 --> 01:18:53.317
but it's our choice
who we become.

01:20:00.851 --> 01:20:03.755
It's not who you
are, or where you've been,

01:20:05.822 --> 01:20:07.825
it's where you're
going that counts.

01:20:09.192 --> 01:20:11.762
I can't tell you how
proud I am of all of you.

01:20:17.401 --> 01:20:20.903
When you get out there on that
course, and you get tired,

01:20:20.905 --> 01:20:23.608
I want you to remind
yourself how far you've come.

01:20:27.844 --> 01:20:29.610
If you guys run with a
purpose in your heart,

01:20:29.612 --> 01:20:31.816
if you give every
ounce of your strength,

01:20:33.417 --> 01:20:35.216
you're already champions.
