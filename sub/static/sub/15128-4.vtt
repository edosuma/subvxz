WEBVTT

00:00.978 --> 00:02.731
You want to know why
those trains collided?

00:02.732 --> 00:04.707
The people wish to know.

00:04.732 --> 00:06.580
<i>The girl is Reid's daughter.</i>

00:06.582 --> 00:08.492
The Leman Street
locomotive tragedy,

00:08.517 --> 00:09.883
55 souls killed.

00:09.908 --> 00:11.413
The sea-can they cleaned out,

00:11.438 --> 00:13.863
it carried bearer bonds,
American dollars.

00:13.888 --> 00:16.589
And you think, what,
Susan was involved in this?

00:16.614 --> 00:19.559
There are some folk claim
to have seen Inspector Reid

00:19.584 --> 00:21.284
<i>bloody like a butcher.</i>

00:21.309 --> 00:23.409
Give me the truth of it.

00:23.434 --> 00:24.983
I have already done so.

00:25.008 --> 00:26.579
<i>We do right by the girl,</i>

00:26.604 --> 00:28.937
but she must remain dead

00:28.962 --> 00:30.429
to her father.

00:30.454 --> 00:31.668
Rose.

00:32.534 --> 00:34.469
<i>I've seen her, the girl.</i>

00:34.494 --> 00:36.043
What do you...?

00:38.938 --> 00:39.819
Hold up!

00:40.630 --> 00:42.593
Alice!

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:02.181 --> 01:04.677
And do it...

01:06.608 --> 01:07.822
<i>Is he sleeping?</i>

01:08.695 --> 01:10.064
-Yeah.
-You sure?

01:11.246 --> 01:12.814
Come on, light it... light it.

01:23.363 --> 01:24.719
Clear off!

01:29.035 --> 01:30.055
Do you see him?

01:30.104 --> 01:31.791
Thought the roof had fallen in.

01:32.860 --> 01:33.953
Did you smell him?

01:33.985 --> 01:37.316
Like one of them crackers
when up him, and his arse shredded.

01:38.513 --> 01:39.245
What?!

01:39.826 --> 01:41.588
Who is it you speak of boy?

01:49.688 --> 01:51.404
Mr. Reid, sir.

01:55.359 --> 01:57.960
What brings you
here, Inspector Drake?

02:00.177 --> 02:01.959
Only a memory.

02:02.982 --> 02:05.671
Of a weekend you
once spoke of, here.

02:05.697 --> 02:07.288
You told me of your

02:07.313 --> 02:10.496
steamer along the Thames,
bound for Margate.

02:10.739 --> 02:12.025
Your wife.

02:13.151 --> 02:14.777
Your Mathilda.

02:15.523 --> 02:16.947
Her first oyster,

02:16.948 --> 02:19.409
-taken from a cultch here.
-Bennet!

02:20.306 --> 02:23.540
Bennet, I cannot, if you
have cuffs in your jacket,

02:23.541 --> 02:26.839
if you have men waiting beyond,

02:26.840 --> 02:28.297
you have a judge
for my arraignment.

02:28.322 --> 02:30.756
You will not say her name again.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.962
No judges, Mr. Reid.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.178
No witnesses were there.

02:36.203 --> 02:39.772
And who is there to
complain on behalf of that man?

02:39.797 --> 02:42.364
Then what? What, why, why...?

02:42.389 --> 02:46.262
Why do you not leave
me here? In peace.

02:46.287 --> 02:49.373
Because I must say it, Mr. Reid.

02:49.860 --> 02:51.595
Her name, that is.

02:52.979 --> 02:54.538
Your Mathilda.

02:55.263 --> 02:56.872
It is why I come.

02:57.332 --> 02:59.075
She has been seen.

02:59.639 --> 03:02.304
Your girl lives, Mr. Reid.

03:06.902 --> 03:07.950
Someone saw her?

03:08.101 --> 03:10.027
Let us get you home, sir.

04:21.380 --> 04:25.734
<b>marythecrazy & PetaG addic7ed</b>

04:27.925 --> 04:29.643
55...

04:29.668 --> 04:31.195
65...

04:33.550 --> 04:35.763
75,000.

04:36.262 --> 04:38.826
The first of five
such exchanges.

04:39.082 --> 04:41.749
It is your guile which
now allows us the peace

04:41.774 --> 04:44.346
to see our bonds
transacted into cash.

04:44.622 --> 04:47.101
But your strategy, Mr. Capshaw.

04:47.163 --> 04:48.668
You disown the credit?

04:48.693 --> 04:50.347
I'm happy to assume it.

04:50.373 --> 04:51.906
Credit?

04:52.279 --> 04:55.177
You imagine me performing
private pirouettes of glee

04:55.202 --> 04:56.971
at all this, do you?

04:57.308 --> 05:01.971
She was my ward, my charge.

05:02.157 --> 05:04.411
She's now disappeared,
I know not where,

05:04.436 --> 05:06.102
in those streets,

05:06.127 --> 05:09.924
and you expect me to
find a feather for your cap?!

05:11.659 --> 05:13.970
Tell me something.

05:14.846 --> 05:16.746
If it is in my gift to do so,

05:16.771 --> 05:17.970
I shall tell it.

05:18.382 --> 05:21.515
I kept you on after the...

05:23.058 --> 05:24.624
Loss of Duggan

05:24.649 --> 05:28.571
because, well, there is one
with his affairs, of course...

05:29.337 --> 05:31.186
but in truth...

05:31.887 --> 05:32.924
I had an instinct

05:32.949 --> 05:35.562
about what you were, as a man...

05:36.519 --> 05:38.419
Or, rather, what you lacked.

05:39.160 --> 05:42.113
Do not mistake me.

05:42.115 --> 05:45.183
It is a quality I
would have all men lack.

05:45.782 --> 05:48.696
It seemed to me you
were happy as you were.

05:48.721 --> 05:50.451
You had no need
to make the world

05:50.452 --> 05:53.409
stand up and applaud
your very existence.

05:55.673 --> 05:57.473
Was I wrong to judge you so?

05:57.498 --> 05:59.121
No.

06:00.233 --> 06:05.410
Not then. But we all
evolve, Miss Susan, do we not?

06:05.789 --> 06:08.403
Adapt to the world
we find ourselves in,

06:08.831 --> 06:10.274
much like this borough

06:10.275 --> 06:12.819
you would shape
to a higher ideal.

06:13.756 --> 06:16.110
I, too, perhaps,

06:17.191 --> 06:19.391
feel myself advance

06:20.726 --> 06:22.774
and, from there,

06:22.882 --> 06:25.329
see further.

06:31.746 --> 06:34.302
Your mistress, girl!
She is to bring herself out,

06:34.327 --> 06:36.076
or I shall pull her
forth by her ears!

06:36.077 --> 06:37.697
Perhaps I am not, after all,

06:37.698 --> 06:39.058
as skilled as you would believe.

06:39.083 --> 06:40.249
What are we to do?

06:40.411 --> 06:42.044
Mathilda!

06:42.069 --> 06:44.197
Lock this cash with
the remaining bonds.

06:44.294 --> 06:45.809
Mathilda!

06:45.834 --> 06:46.981
Then leave.

06:47.013 --> 06:49.047
Mathilda!

06:51.521 --> 06:53.595
Mathilda Reid!

06:55.269 --> 06:56.332
Mathilda!

06:56.469 --> 06:58.825
In there! Mathilda!

06:58.850 --> 07:00.707
Mathilda!

07:01.343 --> 07:03.409
Mathilda!

07:07.942 --> 07:09.634
Mathilda!

07:10.767 --> 07:12.457
Mathilda!

07:15.735 --> 07:17.274
You are sure, Bennet?

07:17.299 --> 07:20.963
I'm sure she said it, and she would not
say it, if she were not sure of it herself.

07:20.964 --> 07:23.210
I see your search
is exhausted, then.

07:23.781 --> 07:25.317
What is this, Inspector?

07:25.669 --> 07:26.500
That is, indeed,

07:26.525 --> 07:28.311
if you're still to
be given that title.

07:28.521 --> 07:30.688
My understanding,
Inspector Drake,

07:30.713 --> 07:34.666
is that this man has a case to answer at
Leman Street for the murder of a suspect

07:34.728 --> 07:37.268
and therefore has no
business stampeding through my house.

07:37.293 --> 07:39.486
You know why it is
I am here, woman.

07:39.842 --> 07:41.046
Now, where is she?

07:41.071 --> 07:42.671
Who, Mr. Reid?

07:42.696 --> 07:43.867
Damn you.

07:43.892 --> 07:45.725
My daughter!

07:45.750 --> 07:48.205
My daughter, that you had
me believe was dead!

07:48.230 --> 07:51.185
Your daughter is dead, sir.

07:58.193 --> 08:00.095
You may kill me,

08:00.120 --> 08:01.368
but it remains the case.

08:01.393 --> 08:02.426
She was seen.

08:03.351 --> 08:04.386
By who?

08:04.411 --> 08:06.411
Whose eyes deceive themselves?

08:06.436 --> 08:08.700
The girl was seen, Miss Susan!

08:08.725 --> 08:10.084
Captain, please, come.

08:10.109 --> 08:11.333
Your lies.

08:11.358 --> 08:13.806
Your eternal lies.

08:13.831 --> 08:15.637
I felt her captor's skull

08:15.661 --> 08:17.227
come apart in my hands,

08:17.252 --> 08:18.916
as you intended.

08:18.941 --> 08:20.284
Reid.

08:20.678 --> 08:22.778
You let her go.

08:23.305 --> 08:25.122
Can't you look at me?

08:25.147 --> 08:26.281
Look at me.

08:26.959 --> 08:29.173
And now you tell
me where is she hid.

08:29.191 --> 08:30.697
She dies, you die.

08:30.729 --> 08:32.070
Now you let her go.

08:39.881 --> 08:42.734
Could be she's gone, sir,
now that her purpose is served.

08:42.759 --> 08:45.255
Whichever way, she
needs you hunting her.

08:45.672 --> 08:47.933
You are watched, bitch.

08:59.424 --> 09:00.723
Charity,

09:00.725 --> 09:02.125
you go mix elderflower water,

09:02.127 --> 09:04.291
two drops of laudanum
within, you got it?

09:08.133 --> 09:10.241
What is this, his daughter?

09:10.662 --> 09:12.024
Does he think her...?

09:12.025 --> 09:13.639
His girl is dead.

09:14.348 --> 09:16.628
Well, he seems to
believe otherwise, Susan.

09:16.629 --> 09:18.131
The last the world
knows of the man,

09:18.156 --> 09:19.719
he kills another
with his own fists.

09:20.338 --> 09:22.788
He has become
deranged, as you have witnessed.

09:22.813 --> 09:25.080
And Drake, he lost
his wits, also?

09:25.116 --> 09:27.300
I do not know and, currently,
I do not care.

09:27.325 --> 09:28.948
I'm half-killed
in my own house,

09:28.973 --> 09:31.294
and, now, must suffer your
interrogation, also?

09:33.138 --> 09:35.189
I wish to know
what's happened here.

09:37.010 --> 09:40.666
Nothing, other than that which I have
previously described, husband.

09:42.184 --> 09:44.964
You wish for another story,
seek another teller.

09:49.145 --> 09:50.744
They have moved her.

09:50.769 --> 09:52.302
Or she has run, Mr. Reid.

09:52.327 --> 09:54.942
And is out here,
somewhere, alone.

09:54.967 --> 09:56.548
Drake!

09:59.934 --> 10:02.012
You find him and bring him here?

10:02.387 --> 10:04.674
Why, Reid, why would
you torment yourself?

10:04.912 --> 10:06.611
She was seen, Jackson.

10:06.612 --> 10:08.818
Rose saw her, a girl hidden,

10:08.843 --> 10:10.104
in there, with red hair.

10:10.105 --> 10:12.516
It is natural, I know, for a man
to want to protect his wife,

10:12.517 --> 10:14.605
but you cannot
protect her from me!

10:14.873 --> 10:17.142
That place, her place,

10:17.167 --> 10:18.974
Obsidian, all
that lies hidden...

10:18.999 --> 10:20.002
Reid, enough.

10:20.740 --> 10:22.427
Now, it's understandable,
of course it is,

10:22.452 --> 10:24.195
but your mind is scrambled.

10:24.221 --> 10:25.499
It's not your own.

10:26.485 --> 10:29.869
Mister, of what my
addled wits see that you and she

10:29.894 --> 10:33.378
are not as estranged as
the world might believe,

10:33.379 --> 10:37.338
that you are still
her creature, Captain.

10:37.363 --> 10:39.283
Drake, come on, stop him.

10:39.463 --> 10:41.509
I have given it thought.

10:41.838 --> 10:44.006
I've asked myself how it is

10:44.007 --> 10:46.494
that the thieves
who went to the rope

10:46.519 --> 10:48.119
for the murder of the 55 did so

10:48.144 --> 10:50.590
without that I could lay my
hands on their paymaster,

10:50.615 --> 10:52.615
he who might then
only be described

10:52.640 --> 10:53.958
but by one other man,

10:53.982 --> 10:56.084
a man named Cree, Captain.

10:56.109 --> 10:58.088
You met him, in my cells,

10:58.113 --> 10:59.303
and yet, then,

10:59.328 --> 11:01.391
he is found with his throat cut,

11:01.416 --> 11:03.816
unable to describe
that face to me further.

11:03.841 --> 11:05.405
A face I believe, now,

11:05.430 --> 11:08.164
may be found in your
mutton wife's halls.

11:08.189 --> 11:10.185
Yes, Captain, Mr. Capshaw.

11:10.210 --> 11:12.310
And she, knowing full well

11:12.335 --> 11:14.428
the part he has played,
once more calls for you,

11:14.528 --> 11:16.638
her still-favourite dupe,

11:16.663 --> 11:19.310
to stroke and tug
our secrets free.

11:19.311 --> 11:20.507
Reid!

11:21.223 --> 11:22.466
Reid!

11:22.492 --> 11:24.556
Edmund Reid!

11:25.832 --> 11:28.731
That's quick work,
Chief Inspector.

11:28.756 --> 11:31.429
Your face is known in
these parts, Edmund.

11:31.430 --> 11:35.147
You raise hell,
word will travel.

11:35.173 --> 11:36.514
There is hell to
be raised, Fred,

11:36.538 --> 11:37.797
and I am to raise it.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.613
My girl is here.

11:39.638 --> 11:41.862
Somewhere. My Mathilda.

11:42.392 --> 11:45.546
Taken from me and then lost
again here, in these streets.

11:54.775 --> 11:56.343
Please,

11:56.345 --> 11:58.312
you are not yourself.

11:58.314 --> 12:01.317
Come in, no cuffs.

12:01.342 --> 12:03.009
We shall talk, you and I,

12:03.034 --> 12:04.816
find the truth of it together.

12:04.841 --> 12:07.588
But you come in.

12:07.963 --> 12:10.651
You can have me, Mr. Abberline,

12:10.676 --> 12:12.226
my word on it, only,

12:12.272 --> 12:14.171
you must let me be for now.

12:14.196 --> 12:15.829
You must let me search.

12:15.831 --> 12:17.197
I will come to you later.

12:17.199 --> 12:19.342
No, Mr. Reid.

12:19.367 --> 12:21.910
You shall come now.

12:55.046 --> 12:58.158
Sure to come to an
ugly end, she said.

13:00.062 --> 13:02.182
An ugly end.

13:14.216 --> 13:17.016
The Frying Pan.

13:26.469 --> 13:27.467
Oi.

13:27.499 --> 13:30.044
Hubba, with me.

13:37.667 --> 13:39.183
He lived from the river,

13:39.208 --> 13:40.627
whatever he could find and sell

13:40.652 --> 13:42.726
from that shop of his.

13:42.752 --> 13:45.688
He must have discovered her
on that shore, unconscious, lost,

13:45.713 --> 13:47.880
removed her to his
wife, his barren wife!

13:48.235 --> 13:51.937
And the woman, Hart,
found her, lied to me!

13:52.145 --> 13:54.120
Lied to me!

13:54.262 --> 13:56.629
Gave me to believe...

13:57.686 --> 13:59.119
Gave me to believe

13:59.225 --> 14:01.896
the trauma of her discovery,

14:01.921 --> 14:03.687
Mathilda did not survive it.

14:03.712 --> 14:05.577
Thus,

14:06.437 --> 14:09.753
the man, Buckley,
taken by you to...

14:10.499 --> 14:12.632
Taken back to that place,

14:12.657 --> 14:15.146
the place where she was...

14:15.633 --> 14:17.246
kept,

14:18.580 --> 14:22.570
and, there, ended.

14:23.238 --> 14:26.205
And all he might speak of

14:26.230 --> 14:28.038
ended with him.

14:32.917 --> 14:35.115
Your daughter, used against you,

14:35.140 --> 14:36.373
yet alive,

14:36.398 --> 14:38.893
broken free from
whatever gilded fetter

14:38.919 --> 14:40.520
Susan Hart had her bound by.

14:40.545 --> 14:45.515
She now walks free in those
streets out there.

14:46.783 --> 14:49.139
This is your belief.

14:49.164 --> 14:51.151
Yes.

14:57.913 --> 14:59.413
All men,

14:59.438 --> 15:02.172
all uniforms, whatever
their arse sit on,

15:02.197 --> 15:04.471
they will be sat
on it no longer.

15:04.496 --> 15:08.233
Thank you. Thank you.

15:08.258 --> 15:11.678
Have a man put on the door
of Buckley's Curiosity Shop.

15:11.703 --> 15:13.496
It is the only home she knows.

15:15.464 --> 15:16.804
No, Edmund.

15:16.829 --> 15:18.859
It is in hand. She is out there.

15:18.884 --> 15:21.985
She will be found,
but you will stay put.

15:22.010 --> 15:23.709
Fred, it is Whitechapel.

15:23.734 --> 15:25.156
I have not had call

15:25.181 --> 15:28.071
to put irons on a
man in three years.

15:28.072 --> 15:31.056
Do not think I forget how.

15:49.786 --> 15:50.673
Here, sir.

15:50.698 --> 15:52.093
Thank you. God bless you.

15:52.097 --> 15:52.597
Cheers.

16:00.443 --> 16:01.737
How now, Harry?

16:01.762 --> 16:06.131
Victor, one baker if you please.
Dollop of butter also.

16:12.322 --> 16:14.001
Erm, much obliged.

16:16.567 --> 16:18.504
"Sure to come to an ugly end,"

16:18.505 --> 16:21.514
said Mrs. Store, "an ugly end."

16:21.735 --> 16:23.229
Hello, beauty.

16:23.550 --> 16:25.038
Look at you,

16:25.063 --> 16:27.397
that pretty dress all mucked.

16:27.835 --> 16:30.633
Sooty angel,
that's what you are.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.743
You hungry, beauty?

16:34.560 --> 16:35.859
'Ere.

16:36.251 --> 16:38.518
A tater, if you wants it,

16:38.543 --> 16:40.717
bought and buttered.

16:41.232 --> 16:43.126
Hungry indeed.

16:48.520 --> 16:50.286
What's your name, then?

16:51.644 --> 16:54.401
I'm not Alice.

16:54.426 --> 16:56.614
Not-Alice?

16:56.640 --> 16:58.767
Then what are ya?

17:01.658 --> 17:04.013
Well, not-Alice,

17:04.039 --> 17:05.681
I am Harry,

17:05.705 --> 17:09.214
and I am charmed to
make your acquaintance.

17:13.535 --> 17:15.167
You eat your tater, beauty.

17:15.193 --> 17:17.752
Wait there one
sec for old Harry.

17:21.854 --> 17:24.234
She's a right one?

17:24.260 --> 17:26.585
Pretty as a picture,
mad as a flag.

17:26.988 --> 17:29.324
That one is sixteen, certainly.

17:30.400 --> 17:31.569
A bit of comelies.

17:31.647 --> 17:33.266
Have the word spread.

17:33.291 --> 17:36.084
Tell 'em Harry Ward
has a new popsy.

17:42.071 --> 17:44.338
Look at that, not-Alice.

17:44.363 --> 17:47.297
Hungry girl, aren't ya?

17:47.434 --> 17:50.569
"See what a jolly
bonnet I've got now."

17:50.802 --> 17:54.070
Jolly, indeed.

17:54.095 --> 17:56.362
Where to now, not-Alice?

17:56.387 --> 17:58.787
Osborn.

17:58.812 --> 18:00.545
Osborn Street?

18:00.883 --> 18:03.711
Do you know the way?

18:03.736 --> 18:06.183
No,

18:07.396 --> 18:12.420
Well, Harry has nowt better
to do currently.

18:23.326 --> 18:25.534
Morning to you, Dr. Frayn.

18:25.536 --> 18:27.703
Morning, Captain Jackson.

18:29.175 --> 18:30.842
This is Mendeleev's

18:30.867 --> 18:32.199
classification, correct?

18:32.224 --> 18:33.257
It is.

18:33.444 --> 18:35.158
You a chemist,

18:35.183 --> 18:36.789
alongside your doctorate?

18:37.181 --> 18:39.928
All doctoring is
chemistry, of one form or another.

18:39.953 --> 18:43.668
Yeah, all life is
chemistry, in one form or another.

18:43.693 --> 18:45.713
Captain, did you come here
solely to pronounce

18:45.738 --> 18:47.041
on the self-evident,

18:47.066 --> 18:48.928
or is there another
purpose to your visit?

18:48.952 --> 18:50.952
It was Aristotle
that said it first,

18:50.996 --> 18:52.429
right?

18:52.454 --> 18:54.534
That the elements from which
everything consists

18:54.559 --> 18:56.492
must necessarily be limited.

18:56.517 --> 18:58.482
Limited to four, he said.

18:58.507 --> 19:01.866
Earth, water, air, fire.

19:01.891 --> 19:03.716
Which are you, Dr. Frayn?

19:04.819 --> 19:08.398
There are other element discovered
beyond Ancient Greece, Captain.

19:08.423 --> 19:11.502
But all those discoveries were
made with the same motive.

19:12.107 --> 19:13.306
Hennig Brand

19:13.331 --> 19:18.059
pisses in the retort, boils it back to
a solid slurry, calls it phosphorous.

19:18.442 --> 19:20.064
Why?

19:21.179 --> 19:24.935
Because he wanted to know
what was fundamental in the thing.

19:27.218 --> 19:30.261
They make one of
these for a person yet?

19:33.096 --> 19:36.175
Your benefactor, Miss
Hart, for example...

19:36.715 --> 19:40.255
You distil her,
what do you find?

19:40.977 --> 19:43.045
Much of my life
would be impossible,

19:43.143 --> 19:45.397
were it not for her
commitment and support.

19:45.484 --> 19:49.130
In her heart, fundamentally Dr.
Frayn, you say she is good?

19:49.155 --> 19:50.837
I do.

19:52.877 --> 19:55.815
You see, now I always
would have agreed with you...

19:55.994 --> 19:59.157
I mean, she cuts her cloth
with the world the way we all must...

19:59.182 --> 20:01.871
but, I trusted her
always, when pushed...

20:01.943 --> 20:03.825
to fall the right way.

20:03.850 --> 20:06.876
You would hope that those
that love you, would say the same.

20:06.901 --> 20:08.252
I would.

20:08.504 --> 20:10.954
But these elements,

20:11.328 --> 20:15.615
they're not stable are they. You apply
heat, you apply pressure, they shift.

20:15.750 --> 20:18.250
Do they not? They
shift and on occasion...

20:19.519 --> 20:21.121
become toxic.

20:21.162 --> 20:24.956
If I require a lecture, on
the production of gases, Captain...

20:24.981 --> 20:27.300
-there are many more qualified to give it
-You see,

20:27.331 --> 20:28.187
what I'm trying

20:28.212 --> 20:31.605
to understand is the chemistry

20:31.761 --> 20:34.194
of how two such
fundamentally good women

20:34.219 --> 20:37.053
as yourself and my admittedly
estranged wife

20:37.077 --> 20:39.120
can stand there
and you tell a man

20:39.145 --> 20:42.560
that his daughter is
dead when she is not.

20:47.020 --> 20:50.111
Now you see, here's the thing...

20:50.655 --> 20:57.755
I wasn't certain of it. Could not
believe it over, not until this moment.

21:31.546 --> 21:32.870
Miss.

21:32.895 --> 21:34.261
Take a look.

21:38.115 --> 21:40.991
Something caught
your eye, has it?

21:42.693 --> 21:44.100
Thank you, sir.

21:47.119 --> 21:48.545
No!

21:49.077 --> 21:51.010
All right, not-Alice.

21:51.035 --> 21:52.853
Steady.

21:55.694 --> 21:57.645
Happy now?

22:01.855 --> 22:03.681
No?

22:04.891 --> 22:06.594
Well, then,

22:07.729 --> 22:09.462
it is time we found a means

22:09.487 --> 22:11.260
for you to repay my...

22:11.433 --> 22:13.021
Generosity.

22:13.740 --> 22:15.835
Little Paternoster and Hanbury.

22:15.860 --> 22:18.033
Hanbury Street?

22:19.149 --> 22:21.243
What are the chances?

22:21.449 --> 22:23.883
That's just where we
are headed, beauty.

22:23.908 --> 22:25.545
You follow me.

22:40.144 --> 22:43.850
They is only streets
beauty, so why the fascination?

22:43.875 --> 22:46.342
What is it you
search for, not-Alice?

22:46.694 --> 22:48.467
My daddy.

22:49.663 --> 22:51.646
Your pops, is it?

22:52.436 --> 22:53.658
Well,

22:53.660 --> 22:55.156
you come with me,

22:55.181 --> 22:57.496
we shall have a
measure or two of gin.

22:57.919 --> 23:00.302
and I shall show you him.

23:06.874 --> 23:08.350
Mr. Reid!

23:09.643 --> 23:12.502
This man, collected on
Thrawl Street just now.

23:12.503 --> 23:14.216
Tell the Inspectors
what you told our men.

23:14.241 --> 23:16.348
It was the dress, sir, white.

23:16.372 --> 23:17.636
And red of hair, correct?

23:17.661 --> 23:19.027
Close on 15 years of age?

23:19.052 --> 23:20.811
And you offered
her your assistance?

23:20.836 --> 23:21.779
I did not, sir.

23:21.804 --> 23:23.571
She was already assisted.

23:24.036 --> 23:25.980
By someone known to you.

23:26.290 --> 23:28.097
His name is Ward, sir.

23:28.122 --> 23:29.188
'Arry Ward.

23:29.190 --> 23:31.179
And how is it he
is known to you?

23:31.204 --> 23:34.150
I station meself
besides The Frying Pan, sir.

23:34.175 --> 23:36.475
A drinker on Thrawl
and Brick Lane.

23:36.817 --> 23:38.373
Indeed, he is well-known.

23:38.398 --> 23:39.798
You tell me...

23:39.800 --> 23:41.857
How so is he known?

23:41.882 --> 23:43.254
He procures

23:43.279 --> 23:44.469
and he sells.

23:45.439 --> 23:48.374
We must find him, this Ward.

23:49.207 --> 23:51.336
Those that pimp the young.

23:53.924 --> 23:56.265
Ward, Harry.

23:58.642 --> 24:00.861
Where does he take them?

24:01.590 --> 24:03.320
Cooley's.

24:03.345 --> 24:05.678
It's that rookery, Mr. Reid.

24:05.703 --> 24:08.375
There's no uniform
stepped inside for 10 years.

24:18.393 --> 24:20.821
We are not in uniform, Bennet.

24:21.394 --> 24:23.146
No, Mr. Reid.

24:23.988 --> 24:25.238
No!

24:25.240 --> 24:26.540
Inspector Drake!

24:26.541 --> 24:29.714
I brought you here so
this man could be corralled,

24:29.739 --> 24:32.432
not spun into ever-greater
acts of lunacy!

24:32.444 --> 24:33.645
I'm sorry your faith in me

24:33.646 --> 24:36.059
is not better rewarded,
Chief Inspector.

24:36.084 --> 24:37.060
Edmund,

24:37.891 --> 24:39.991
think on what you do.

24:40.016 --> 24:42.527
For once, Fred, there
is no need to think,

24:42.552 --> 24:43.711
only to act.

24:43.736 --> 24:46.748
My friend and I go
to fetch my daughter

24:49.230 --> 24:50.173
Now.

24:51.361 --> 24:53.418
We are leaving.

25:17.070 --> 25:20.556
Do not fear, beauty,
this is Harry's land.

25:20.782 --> 25:23.906
No harm shall come to
you, in Harry's land.

25:40.304 --> 25:42.464
Afternoon, Agatha.

25:42.489 --> 25:43.220
Harry.

25:43.221 --> 25:44.705
Special 7, if you please.

25:47.908 --> 25:49.865
Here we are, not-Alice.

25:50.477 --> 25:52.097
Up the stairs, now.

25:52.507 --> 25:53.844
Come on, Alice.

25:53.845 --> 25:55.748
I have to take
you to your daddy.

26:06.644 --> 26:08.477
You, Ward.

26:08.502 --> 26:09.935
Been here nigh on an hour.

26:09.960 --> 26:12.263
No complaints, now, are there?

26:16.599 --> 26:18.530
You know the dance.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.705
'Ere's wisdom.

26:59.874 --> 27:02.824
Two ways this thing now goes.

27:03.089 --> 27:04.464
You scream,

27:05.238 --> 27:06.688
you get a clout.

27:06.689 --> 27:08.448
You keep yourself peaceful

27:09.045 --> 27:10.626
and it passes quick-like.

27:11.638 --> 27:13.120
My daddy?

27:13.619 --> 27:16.104
I'm your daddy now, beauty.

27:17.535 --> 27:20.984
And I believe I
shall take mine first.

27:42.679 --> 27:44.735
Harry Ward! Which room?!

27:47.610 --> 27:48.922
7!

27:54.220 --> 27:56.304
Where is she?! Where is she?!

27:56.329 --> 27:58.062
The roof, sir!

28:00.035 --> 28:02.305
You, stay there.

28:03.181 --> 28:05.338
Go to her, Drake, get her!

28:09.080 --> 28:12.183
Go on! Do not lose
her! Do not lose her!

28:14.526 --> 28:16.453
Mathilda!

28:21.715 --> 28:23.227
You.

28:23.228 --> 28:24.790
You are Harry Ward.

28:25.195 --> 28:27.168
You are with me.

28:32.525 --> 28:33.574
Get out!

28:38.088 --> 28:39.588
Mathilda!

28:39.613 --> 28:40.979
Mathilda Reid!

28:41.846 --> 28:43.260
Stop, child.

28:43.285 --> 28:44.350
Please.

28:44.375 --> 28:46.016
Please, stay where you are.

28:46.898 --> 28:48.570
Who are you?

28:50.130 --> 28:51.601
Uncle Ben.

28:51.626 --> 28:53.197
Who bought you strawberry ices

28:53.222 --> 28:54.889
on Petticoat Lane each Sunday.

28:55.442 --> 28:57.947
A... and your gloves
would get all sticky with 'em

28:58.183 --> 29:00.645
and your mother would have words
with me for allowing such.

29:01.300 --> 29:02.502
Each weekend,

29:02.527 --> 29:04.030
we would do the same, Mathilda,

29:04.048 --> 29:05.414
you and I.

29:05.654 --> 29:07.533
"Strawberry ices with Uncle Ben"

29:07.558 --> 29:09.142
was what you would say.

29:13.676 --> 29:15.543
And my daddy?

29:16.511 --> 29:18.335
He is my friend.

29:18.762 --> 29:20.784
Inspector Edmund Reid,

29:20.862 --> 29:24.064
your father, my friend.

29:25.067 --> 29:26.748
Inspector Reid.

29:28.944 --> 29:30.376
Mathilda.

29:30.401 --> 29:31.805
No, please, wait!

29:32.190 --> 29:33.196
Mathilda!

29:33.221 --> 29:34.988
She flees, sir!

29:47.114 --> 29:48.999
She got away from me, Mr. Reid.

29:51.284 --> 29:52.950
But...

29:52.975 --> 29:54.442
was it her, Bennet?

29:55.998 --> 29:57.560
I am sure of it, sir.

30:02.569 --> 30:03.956
Mr. Ward!

30:04.165 --> 30:05.981
That face of yours needs a wash.

30:09.549 --> 30:13.446
Fear not Inspector I
will not kill him. Not yet.

30:17.267 --> 30:21.640
Now, you will
tell me everything!

30:21.665 --> 30:23.187
No matter how small the detail,

30:23.212 --> 30:24.837
it will be important to me.

30:24.838 --> 30:26.242
Do you understand?!

30:26.266 --> 30:28.640
Everything she said,
everything she did,

30:28.641 --> 30:30.349
where she came from,
where she was going.

30:30.351 --> 30:31.177
Yes, sir.

30:31.202 --> 30:32.032
Then begin.

30:32.404 --> 30:34.383
You found her outside
The Frying Pan.

30:34.795 --> 30:35.690
Yes, sir.

30:35.715 --> 30:36.974
And then?

30:37.407 --> 30:39.593
Then I took her to where she
wanted to go, didn't I?

30:39.618 --> 30:40.609
Where, boy?

30:40.633 --> 30:41.699
Osborn.

30:41.724 --> 30:42.753
And then?

30:43.392 --> 30:45.795
S-Spitalfields
Market, B-Brushfield Street,

30:45.820 --> 30:47.584
Little Paternoster Row, Hanbury.

30:49.523 --> 30:51.448
What was it she used to cut you?

30:51.720 --> 30:54.121
There was a shard of mirror
up there on the bed.

30:54.146 --> 30:55.264
Yes, that.

30:55.265 --> 30:56.552
Where was it found?

30:56.553 --> 30:57.939
H-had it with her, sir.

30:57.983 --> 30:59.420
Er, kept it in her purse.

30:59.421 --> 31:00.766
About her neck, sir,

31:00.791 --> 31:03.002
a white scarf with
a red border, tied.

31:03.027 --> 31:04.655
-Knotted at the front?
-Indeed.

31:04.977 --> 31:06.515
Bought that for her, I did.

31:06.540 --> 31:08.127
And what else? What else?

31:08.152 --> 31:09.352
Her words.

31:09.353 --> 31:10.878
Her words! What
did she speak of?

31:10.879 --> 31:12.330
N-nothing of no
sense, Mr. Reid.

31:12.355 --> 31:13.888
Nonetheless, her words!

31:13.913 --> 31:17.106
She spoke of a bonnet, but there
was no bonnet on her to speak of.

31:17.107 --> 31:18.519
Precise words!

31:19.148 --> 31:24.038
"Perhaps, see this... ", no.

31:24.625 --> 31:27.022
"See what a jolly
bonnet I've got now."

31:28.499 --> 31:30.002
Y-yes, but...

31:30.277 --> 31:33.803
If... if you know
already, why do you ask?

31:36.604 --> 31:38.367
How is that possible?

31:38.605 --> 31:41.526
Does she follow them, Mr. Reid?

31:41.723 --> 31:43.377
Polly and Annie,

31:43.402 --> 31:45.205
The Ripper's first victims.

31:45.231 --> 31:48.348
Their last wanderings,
Polly Nichols

31:48.373 --> 31:50.499
and Annie Chapman,
the final hours

31:50.524 --> 31:52.428
before they fell
beneath his knife.

31:52.453 --> 31:54.444
The streets they
walked, what they wore,

31:54.469 --> 31:56.077
what they carried.

31:57.551 --> 31:58.894
Where The Ripper did his work,

31:58.919 --> 32:01.001
my daughter now follows.

32:05.383 --> 32:07.480
We have done what we
can to forget these names,

32:07.505 --> 32:09.976
but his killings must
be remembered now, so.

32:10.837 --> 32:13.537
Ward picks her up outside The
Frying Pan public house.

32:13.686 --> 32:15.182
Friday the 31st of August,

32:15.207 --> 32:16.640
12:30 am,

32:16.665 --> 32:18.739
Polly Nichols is seen
leaving The Frying Pan

32:18.764 --> 32:21.150
at the corner of Brick
Lane and Thrawl Street.

32:21.175 --> 32:22.641
She returned to
the lodging house

32:22.666 --> 32:24.092
at 18 Thrawl Street,

32:24.093 --> 32:26.055
where the deputy tells
her to leave the kitchen

32:26.056 --> 32:27.849
of the lodging house because she

32:27.874 --> 32:30.041
has not produced her doss money.

32:30.839 --> 32:35.144
"Never mind," she
said, "I shall soon have it.

32:35.782 --> 32:38.252
See what a jolly bonnet

32:38.254 --> 32:39.799
I've got now."

32:45.055 --> 32:48.056
Osborn, next, so Ward says.

32:48.058 --> 32:51.180
2:30 am, er, Emily
Holland meets Polly

32:51.181 --> 32:54.431
outside the grocer's on Whitechapel
Road and Osborn Street.

32:54.456 --> 32:56.373
Polly tells her she
has earned her doss money

32:56.374 --> 32:59.072
three times over and
drunk it all away.

32:59.097 --> 33:01.831
3:40 or 3:45 am,

33:01.856 --> 33:04.222
Polly Nichols'
body is discovered

33:04.247 --> 33:06.894
at Buck's Row by Charles Cross.

33:06.895 --> 33:09.159
A coal man on his way to work

33:09.184 --> 33:11.635
at Pickford's, on the City Road.

33:11.676 --> 33:13.933
Ward does not take
Mathilda there, however.

33:13.958 --> 33:16.183
Spitalfields, Brushfield Street,

33:16.208 --> 33:19.559
Little Paternoster Row, Hanbury.

33:20.379 --> 33:22.279
She follows Polly

33:22.304 --> 33:24.306
and then, she follows Annie.

33:24.558 --> 33:26.586
Saturday, September the 8th,

33:26.611 --> 33:27.877
1:35 am,

33:27.902 --> 33:29.809
Annie Chapman is seen leaving

33:29.834 --> 33:31.330
Crossingham's Lodging House

33:31.355 --> 33:33.889
and entering into
Little Paternoster Row

33:33.914 --> 33:36.381
in the direction of
Brushfield Street.

33:36.406 --> 33:39.653
5:30 am, Elizabeth
Long sees Annie with a man

33:39.678 --> 33:41.790
hard against the
shutters of 29 Hanbury Street.

33:42.420 --> 33:44.017
Long hears the man ask

33:44.043 --> 33:45.097
"Will you?",

33:45.379 --> 33:48.194
and hears Annie reply "Yes."

33:48.640 --> 33:50.919
Long is certain of the
time, as she had heard the clock

33:50.920 --> 33:54.118
on the Black Eagle Brewery struck the
half hour as she turned into the street.

33:54.170 --> 33:57.009
Man has his back
towards the witness,

33:57.120 --> 33:59.874
who therefore can
not describe his face.

34:00.957 --> 34:02.422
Edmund,

34:02.447 --> 34:05.268
how does your Mathilda
know these things,

34:05.293 --> 34:07.694
the fine details
of The Ripper case?

34:08.137 --> 34:09.478
The shard of glass

34:09.504 --> 34:11.469
that Polly Nichols
had in her purse,

34:11.494 --> 34:12.949
the red and white neckerchief

34:12.975 --> 34:15.230
that Annie Chapman
had tied around her neck?

34:15.963 --> 34:17.652
These are...

34:18.208 --> 34:21.409
not even those
hounds at The Star

34:21.434 --> 34:22.603
have such knowledge.

34:23.937 --> 34:25.623
Pardon me.

34:25.648 --> 34:28.047
The American
surgeon called, sir.

34:28.072 --> 34:29.842
Wishes to speak with Mr. Reid.

34:29.867 --> 34:31.210
He has a woman with him.

34:31.378 --> 34:33.545
Pronounces it of
current urgency.

34:35.474 --> 34:38.192
The world that had
been constructed for Alice.

34:38.193 --> 34:39.233
Mathilda.

34:39.583 --> 34:41.781
Her name is Mathilda.

34:42.264 --> 34:44.882
It was a world of fantasy, sir,

34:45.159 --> 34:47.324
of fairy tales made real,

34:47.815 --> 34:50.658
where she was
protected by her parents

34:50.808 --> 34:52.732
from the violent
and terrible forces.

34:52.733 --> 34:53.989
"Forces"?

34:54.130 --> 34:56.960
You mean the boat,
her near-drowning,

34:56.962 --> 35:00.204
the the flames, the
water, the death?

35:00.205 --> 35:02.608
That certain trauma
was helpful to them

35:02.633 --> 35:04.225
in the immediate sense, yes.

35:05.500 --> 35:06.999
But there were horrors,

35:07.313 --> 35:09.313
which preceded that moment,

35:09.338 --> 35:12.941
that were born when you
still had her, Mr. Reid.

35:13.276 --> 35:15.009
What?

35:16.799 --> 35:19.948
What? God damn you,
woman, speak! What?!

35:20.223 --> 35:23.326
I spoke with Mathilda
at great length,

35:23.351 --> 35:25.631
attempted to peel
back the fiction

35:25.656 --> 35:27.255
she had come to live,

35:27.280 --> 35:29.171
to see what she lived before.

35:29.640 --> 35:32.880
I returned her to
where her trauma began.

35:33.277 --> 35:35.297
What did you find?

35:35.322 --> 35:37.869
There are stories she tells

35:38.291 --> 35:41.079
the women, dead women,

35:41.104 --> 35:43.740
she could not provide
any greater detail, but

35:43.765 --> 35:46.518
that is what she disinterred
from her memory.

35:47.116 --> 35:48.956
Two dead woman.

35:48.981 --> 35:52.206
their bodies brutally put apart.

35:53.843 --> 35:54.798
It is this

35:54.799 --> 35:58.160
which persuaded me
that the wicked king

35:58.161 --> 36:00.084
she had made of her
father might, indeed,

36:00.109 --> 36:02.060
be as wicked as she imagined.

36:09.943 --> 36:11.619
Which women?

36:12.419 --> 36:16.178
They did not have
names, only stories.

36:18.783 --> 36:20.574
And pictures.

36:20.891 --> 36:22.850
She drew them.

36:28.876 --> 36:32.803
These these stories
you speak of...

36:32.828 --> 36:37.265
what other elements, besides these
pictures, I mean... were there...?

36:37.290 --> 36:39.878
streets...? The
streets of Whitechapel.

36:39.903 --> 36:40.721
That's right.

36:40.722 --> 36:44.593
And belongings, personal belongings? A
scarf, a shard of glass used as a mirror?

36:44.619 --> 36:46.951
Perhaps, I think so.

36:48.574 --> 36:50.507
Sergeant Artherton.

36:52.517 --> 36:53.589
Mr. Reid.

36:53.614 --> 36:55.490
Captain Jackson and
Dr. Frayn are leaving.

36:55.491 --> 36:57.656
-No, Reid, wait.
-I've heard enough.

37:00.414 --> 37:02.235
Mr. Reid, please.

37:02.795 --> 37:04.800
I did not treat Mathilda

37:04.825 --> 37:06.459
without becoming fond of her.

37:06.484 --> 37:09.885
What she saw there,
in her personal history,

37:09.910 --> 37:11.778
was it real?

37:12.304 --> 37:14.450
In one way, yes.

37:14.475 --> 37:16.794
Now, get out.

37:19.093 --> 37:20.417
Both of you.

37:32.728 --> 37:35.648
Sergeant Artherton, my archive,
the Northwest Corner,

37:35.673 --> 37:37.829
there is a long, steel
case propped there,

37:37.854 --> 37:39.220
rusted, I'm sure.

37:39.245 --> 37:41.014
Would you be so kind
as to fetch it to me?

37:41.015 --> 37:41.627
Yes, sir.

37:47.850 --> 37:48.811
When...

37:49.692 --> 37:53.502
people are lost to us, it is perhaps
true that we remember them as we

37:53.557 --> 37:55.771
wish them to have
been, not as they were.

37:55.869 --> 37:59.585
The daughter of mine, who when
into the water that day.

38:00.218 --> 38:01.570
For many weeks

38:01.595 --> 38:05.520
she had not smiled, nor taken my hand,
without that I had taken hers first.

38:06.109 --> 38:08.784
on the boat, before the collision,
she would not even allow that.

38:08.785 --> 38:10.714
She kept ripping herself free.

38:11.031 --> 38:12.571
There is weeks,

38:12.603 --> 38:14.862
the first weeks,

38:14.887 --> 38:18.268
the knowledge that the
killer had begun and would go on...

38:18.494 --> 38:21.407
This here, this
station house, I barely left.

38:21.669 --> 38:25.172
And when I did leave, the station
house came home with me.

38:38.071 --> 38:40.908
Unbeknown to me, she
must have found it,

38:40.933 --> 38:44.253
the map I made of his
works and his victims.

38:44.596 --> 38:45.551
Found it

38:45.576 --> 38:48.422
and, somehow compelled
by the horror,

38:48.467 --> 38:50.166
studied it.

38:50.191 --> 38:52.047
And returns to it now.

38:52.072 --> 38:54.423
These atrocities are
all that she now remembers

38:54.448 --> 38:56.174
of our life together.

38:56.199 --> 38:58.542
Edmund, she cannot

38:58.568 --> 39:00.728
follow them all, however.

39:00.752 --> 39:01.495
Indeed, indeed.

39:01.496 --> 39:04.668
The Pride of Wapping, my daughter and
I aboard, sank the 15th September.

39:05.116 --> 39:09.196
Mathilda, thereafter, in
the care of the Buckleys.

39:09.221 --> 39:10.822
And Miss Stride,

39:11.577 --> 39:13.526
Catherine Eddowes,

39:14.283 --> 39:17.370
Mary Jane Kelly, did
not exist for her.

39:21.467 --> 39:23.505
Sergeant, these to be burnt.

39:27.423 --> 39:28.226
Donald.

39:29.046 --> 39:31.625
Men stationed at
all these addresses.

39:40.282 --> 39:42.810
Captain Jackson.

39:43.718 --> 39:46.066
Feet on my desk,
drinking my whiskey.

39:46.067 --> 39:48.114
This is not the
station house on Leman Street,

39:48.138 --> 39:49.314
nor am I Edmund Reid.

39:49.339 --> 39:50.657
Yeah, his is hooch.

39:50.764 --> 39:52.182
Yours is decent.

39:52.288 --> 39:54.021
None of which surprises me.

39:55.857 --> 39:58.131
What is it you want, Captain?

39:58.308 --> 40:01.408
When last we parleyed,
you were far from receptive.

40:03.057 --> 40:05.558
That fella I saw you with

40:05.663 --> 40:07.759
the day the train...

40:08.716 --> 40:11.071
Died with his head in your lap.

40:14.799 --> 40:16.533
What of him?

40:16.558 --> 40:18.491
You loved him.

40:23.437 --> 40:26.172
And it's for his sake that you

40:26.197 --> 40:29.878
mount the investigation you
informed me of, last we met.

40:29.879 --> 40:31.372
Susan Hart,

40:31.397 --> 40:34.947
her father, these
bearer bonds you speak of, you

40:34.972 --> 40:38.214
understand why it
is a difficult thing

40:38.239 --> 40:40.380
for me to hear you say that?

40:40.405 --> 40:41.412
I do.

40:42.918 --> 40:44.479
You love her.

40:46.284 --> 40:48.609
Would something
that approached proof

40:49.002 --> 40:50.135
be of interest?

40:51.019 --> 40:53.653
Since I brought
that telegram to you,

40:53.678 --> 40:56.645
I have dug deeper
into its details.

40:57.605 --> 40:59.559
Theodore Patrick Swift

40:59.584 --> 41:01.759
moves his money
on a regular basis

41:01.784 --> 41:03.002
through Whitechapel,

41:03.003 --> 41:05.321
de facto fiefdom, you might say,

41:05.322 --> 41:08.234
of his estranged
daughter, your beloved Miss Susan,

41:08.235 --> 41:10.763
and that money is stolen.

41:10.788 --> 41:14.402
And I told you that conjecture
ain't worth a pot of piss to me.

41:14.680 --> 41:15.971
Nor to me.

41:17.430 --> 41:19.553
Her man Capshaw,

41:19.928 --> 41:23.161
he's a curious one,
would you not agree?

41:23.186 --> 41:25.097
Such still waters.

41:25.122 --> 41:27.140
I have never met
the man, myself.

41:27.165 --> 41:29.688
Well, perhaps it is time
you made the effort.

41:31.372 --> 41:33.305
The City of London,

41:33.330 --> 41:36.164
it squirms with
agents of all kind.

41:36.490 --> 41:38.673
An unregulated
pasture of opportunity,

41:38.698 --> 41:40.609
should you have a burgled bag of

41:40.634 --> 41:43.217
anonymous securities
to see exchanged

41:43.242 --> 41:44.774
into ready cash.

41:45.191 --> 41:47.168
I followed Mr.
Capshaw this morning

41:47.193 --> 41:49.435
as he visited just
one such an agent.

41:49.515 --> 41:51.666
You see the signature, Captain.

41:52.678 --> 41:55.112
Capshaw.

41:56.270 --> 41:58.142
Captain.

41:58.464 --> 42:00.200
Mine.

42:33.849 --> 42:36.272
The word is out, Mr. Reid.

42:36.748 --> 42:38.593
She cannot step foot on
one of those streets

42:38.618 --> 42:40.404
without our men
there to greet her

42:40.405 --> 42:41.864
and see her back to you.

42:41.889 --> 42:44.576
You do not insist
on joining them?

42:47.803 --> 42:49.036
No Fred.

42:50.143 --> 42:52.148
After all I...

42:52.367 --> 42:55.417
If, in her mind I
am somehow become

42:55.798 --> 42:59.010
monstrous, no.

42:59.235 --> 43:02.586
I cannot risk that
she will run from me.

43:04.013 --> 43:06.122
Whatever now happens, I am...

43:06.546 --> 43:08.541
I am finished with this life.

43:08.566 --> 43:12.123
And so now I ask only
one more request of you both.

43:12.148 --> 43:13.670
She knew you.

43:13.695 --> 43:15.969
Mathilda knew you, so, please,

43:15.994 --> 43:18.903
be out there yourselves,
search for her yourselves,

43:18.927 --> 43:22.628
be there to reassure her,
should she be found.

43:25.793 --> 43:27.408
Thank you.

43:47.880 --> 43:50.358
What is it you thought
to find here, Mathilda?

44:01.569 --> 44:03.202
Mr. Artherton.

44:03.227 --> 44:04.727
Inspector.

44:05.011 --> 44:06.862
I'm leaving here, Sergeant.

44:07.486 --> 44:08.923
Will you stop me?

44:09.081 --> 44:12.345
Well, that depends,
sir, on where it is you go.

44:12.370 --> 44:13.969
To fetch my girl.

44:13.971 --> 44:16.359
There are men already
about her purpose,

44:16.384 --> 44:17.717
as you know.

44:17.742 --> 44:20.460
This is where she will be
brung, so it's best you wait here.

44:20.461 --> 44:22.353
But they will not find
her where they look.

44:22.379 --> 44:23.615
Mr. Reid!

44:24.326 --> 44:26.357
Do you trust me?

44:27.489 --> 44:29.206
I always have.

44:29.398 --> 44:32.431
Then you turn about,
drink your coffee.

45:52.344 --> 45:54.143
Hello.

45:56.654 --> 45:58.187
Hello.

46:03.788 --> 46:07.141
There was a bird
caught in here once.

46:07.736 --> 46:09.368
There was.

46:09.393 --> 46:11.716
You trapped it.

46:13.221 --> 46:14.890
I did.

46:16.696 --> 46:18.985
And then, you set it free.

46:21.579 --> 46:23.003
I remember.

46:25.183 --> 46:28.686
And... can you say your name?

46:46.202 --> 46:48.624
I am

46:50.620 --> 46:52.286
Mathilda.

46:52.651 --> 46:54.058
You are

46:57.468 --> 46:58.968
Mathilda.

46:59.631 --> 47:02.294
Do you know how I found you?

47:05.463 --> 47:08.374
You remember the map, don't you?

47:10.989 --> 47:12.088
The women.

47:12.113 --> 47:13.415
Yes.

47:13.440 --> 47:16.047
The dead women.

47:16.812 --> 47:19.182
You were following them.

47:20.186 --> 47:22.536
And then you stopped.

47:24.324 --> 47:27.168
The map, you put
pins in the map.

47:28.327 --> 47:31.027
Where I thought
they would be safe.

47:31.052 --> 47:32.776
Here.

47:32.801 --> 47:35.536
You put pins in here.

47:36.158 --> 47:38.024
They would be safe here.

47:38.049 --> 47:40.382
And why would they be safe?

47:40.808 --> 47:42.496
Wh...

47:42.522 --> 47:45.019
Why would they be
safe here, Mathilda?

47:47.168 --> 47:49.655
Because my daddy
would protect them.

47:53.135 --> 47:58.310
And who am I, Mathilda?

48:02.515 --> 48:04.571
You are my daddy.

48:06.909 --> 48:07.409
Yep.

49:08.767 --> 49:10.700
Sit down.

49:23.099 --> 49:25.146
The last time you
brought me here,

49:25.171 --> 49:27.489
there was a diamond
in your coat pocket.

49:28.814 --> 49:33.081
Yeah, things were,
er, different then?

49:33.886 --> 49:36.025
I'd hoped to bring
you back to me.

49:36.807 --> 49:38.719
Whereas, now?

49:39.896 --> 49:42.703
Perhaps I'm glad I failed.

49:43.547 --> 49:45.641
I did not agree to
this because your carping

49:45.666 --> 49:47.321
was a sound for which I yearned.

49:47.346 --> 49:50.468
You're gonna sit and
you're gonna listen.

49:50.830 --> 49:52.857
You've been usin' me.

49:52.882 --> 49:54.232
Indeed?

49:54.257 --> 49:57.112
And what possible use
could I have for you?

49:57.138 --> 49:59.657
The day that
locomotive came down,

49:59.829 --> 50:02.211
the first occasion
I have to step foot

50:02.212 --> 50:04.125
in that station house
in almost three years,

50:04.150 --> 50:06.083
and I find you on my doorstep,

50:06.108 --> 50:08.265
with your cooing entreaties,

50:08.290 --> 50:10.186
and I speak to you in good faith

50:10.211 --> 50:11.661
and I tell you what
you need to hear

50:11.662 --> 50:12.884
and, lo,

50:13.460 --> 50:15.806
Reid misses his man.

50:16.238 --> 50:18.236
Excuse me.

50:18.582 --> 50:21.137
Five men went to the scaffold,
did they not?

50:21.162 --> 50:22.891
But not the man.

50:23.360 --> 50:24.904
Not your man,

50:25.221 --> 50:27.062
Miss Hart.

50:41.194 --> 50:44.132
If you are going
to make accusation

50:44.243 --> 50:47.153
I suggest you do so clearly.

50:49.438 --> 50:51.702
Bearer bonds.

50:52.768 --> 50:55.336
Dollars, darlin',
our native currency,

50:55.733 --> 50:58.168
and stolen from your father.

50:58.192 --> 51:00.369
But what I have
yet to conclude...

51:00.816 --> 51:03.791
was it your Mr. Capshaw
that fixed the job

51:04.422 --> 51:06.083
or was it you, Susan?

51:06.537 --> 51:08.177
Is that why you told Reid

51:08.202 --> 51:10.293
his girl was dead
when she was not?

51:20.230 --> 51:22.330
The girl.

51:22.355 --> 51:23.888
Reid's girl.

51:23.913 --> 51:25.143
The lies.

51:25.168 --> 51:26.698
What you put inside
that man's head.

51:26.699 --> 51:31.227
A man that you have known in fellowship,
and you lace him with such torment.

51:34.599 --> 51:36.933
I want to know if I can see it,

51:37.550 --> 51:39.722
see the evil that has
come to roost in you,

51:39.747 --> 51:41.212
Caitlin Swift,

51:41.237 --> 51:43.754
the woman that I once made mine.

51:47.703 --> 51:49.937
And can you?

51:49.962 --> 51:51.361
Can you see it?

51:52.387 --> 51:55.394
I see what I've always seen.

51:55.781 --> 51:57.625
What is that?

51:59.374 --> 52:02.937
I see the face of
the woman that I love.

52:18.697 --> 52:21.344
Does it feel like
flesh, Matthew?

52:21.369 --> 52:23.448
Because, to me,
it does no longer.

52:29.400 --> 52:30.819
This world,

52:30.844 --> 52:33.396
the world where I carve
a place for myself,

52:33.813 --> 52:35.105
the world of men,

52:35.369 --> 52:36.811
it would turn on me,

52:36.836 --> 52:38.411
tear my flesh from my bones,

52:38.436 --> 52:40.925
and feed me to the crows and so,

52:40.950 --> 52:43.396
each step I've taken,
I've hardened myself.

52:43.421 --> 52:46.288
Each step, every day,
the creep of it unrelenting,

52:46.289 --> 52:49.088
until, one morning, I
touch myself and wonder

52:49.326 --> 52:52.325
if I am not, after
all, become stone.

52:54.630 --> 52:58.339
I have not known
another, not since.

53:16.472 --> 53:17.604
Will we be together?

53:17.629 --> 53:19.296
We will, my darling.

53:19.933 --> 53:21.403
Where, here?

53:21.428 --> 53:23.822
No. No, not here.

53:23.847 --> 53:27.285
Not... not
Whitechapel, not London.

53:28.428 --> 53:30.079
Then where, Daddy?

53:30.529 --> 53:32.445
Do you remember the seaside?

53:32.628 --> 53:35.396
We stayed in a house
by the sea once.

53:36.606 --> 53:39.317
Well, it... it's very pretty

53:39.342 --> 53:42.789
and there are birds
and a sandy beach.

53:43.175 --> 53:45.920
And it's very quiet, Mathilda.

53:46.027 --> 53:48.432
And the sun shines,
and you may...

53:48.457 --> 53:51.864
you may like be needed with your shoes
and socks off. And your feet in the water.

53:52.629 --> 53:54.107
It is not like the river?

53:54.132 --> 53:55.390
No, no.

53:55.523 --> 53:57.957
No, the river here
is a dead thing

53:57.958 --> 53:59.491
and the sea is life.

53:59.627 --> 54:01.238
We shall go there.

54:02.679 --> 54:03.601
When?

54:03.626 --> 54:06.894
Now, this morning.

54:07.381 --> 54:09.214
We shall get you
washed and cleaned

54:09.239 --> 54:11.005
and then, we shall
find a dress for you.

54:11.030 --> 54:14.375
And we'll pack a small bag,
and then we shall go.

54:19.143 --> 54:21.393
A little big, perhaps,
but it'll serve

54:21.394 --> 54:23.299
until we find you
some new clothes.

54:28.514 --> 54:31.481
I shall leave you
whilst you change.

54:34.201 --> 54:35.945
Please.

54:39.725 --> 54:41.617
Where is my mother?

54:48.727 --> 54:50.343
She...

54:55.699 --> 54:58.389
Your Mamma is no longer with us.

55:02.122 --> 55:04.420
My darling girl

55:04.453 --> 55:08.995
a day shall come when
we shall talk and talk

55:09.034 --> 55:10.417
and I shall tell you

55:10.442 --> 55:15.629
of everything that missed the ***
in the year since... since we lost you.

55:17.013 --> 55:19.632
But for now, know
only this... your Mamma

55:19.657 --> 55:24.265
loved you in every thought, in every
breath, in every beat of her heart.

55:25.274 --> 55:29.242
She never passed a moment of her life
without thinking on you, in that love.

55:32.316 --> 55:35.771
Now... change.

55:48.083 --> 55:49.482
Reid.

55:49.507 --> 55:51.520
Open up. I have
something for ya.

55:53.005 --> 55:55.272
Reid, it's me. Open
up. I know you're in there.

56:05.973 --> 56:08.536
Morning, Inspector.

56:08.965 --> 56:10.837
Fear not, I've got
one thing to give you,

56:10.862 --> 56:13.038
and then I'm gone,
and no man ever the wiser.

56:13.064 --> 56:14.792
This is everything you need.

56:15.357 --> 56:17.823
It's Ronald Capshaw, named
in the transaction

56:17.848 --> 56:20.209
of U.S. bearer bonds
to pounds sterling.

56:21.018 --> 56:23.694
55 men, women, and children.

56:24.677 --> 56:26.811
This is a warrant, Reid.

56:27.121 --> 56:28.204
For what it's worth,

56:28.229 --> 56:31.020
I don't believe
Susan a part of it.

56:41.761 --> 56:43.566
Mathilda,

56:43.591 --> 56:48.461
this is Captain
Jackson, an associate of mine.

56:48.567 --> 56:50.326
Good morning, sir.

56:50.554 --> 56:52.317
Good morning.

57:00.985 --> 57:03.802
You're both leaving.

57:04.922 --> 57:07.155
No, you know what?

57:07.180 --> 57:08.446
Forget it.

57:08.471 --> 57:09.570
You go.

57:09.595 --> 57:10.694
No.

57:10.719 --> 57:12.352
Show it to me.

57:22.617 --> 57:24.513
It is, as you say,
all that is needed

57:24.538 --> 57:26.786
for the 55 dead to
have their justice.

57:28.190 --> 57:29.364
It is, but,

57:29.365 --> 57:31.564
you might imagine
the world capable

57:31.565 --> 57:33.654
of righting itself without ya.

57:34.061 --> 57:36.265
To believe otherwise
is just another stripe

57:36.290 --> 57:37.390
of selfishness.

57:37.415 --> 57:39.354
And, yet, you bring this to me.

57:39.379 --> 57:41.470
Because I know you, Reid.

57:44.062 --> 57:46.809
What I say is change,
the permanent kind,

57:46.834 --> 57:48.520
the change you seek,

57:49.715 --> 57:52.349
you will never see it.

57:54.918 --> 57:56.656
Just like...

57:57.410 --> 57:59.844
The rising of
mountains, all of this...

57:59.869 --> 58:01.319
You, me?

58:03.731 --> 58:05.586
It's nothing.

58:06.381 --> 58:08.548
It is nothing.

58:09.074 --> 58:11.690
It is everything.

58:16.725 --> 58:18.985
As you see fit.

58:20.234 --> 58:22.647
Goodbye, Reid.

58:26.003 --> 58:28.074
Goodbye, Captain.

58:51.489 --> 58:53.809
Have bad people,
done bad things?

58:53.834 --> 58:54.947
They had.

58:57.046 --> 58:59.553
And you will catch
them and put them in prison?

58:59.578 --> 59:01.619
Will you not, my Daddy?

59:21.256 --> 59:22.989
Mr. Reid.

59:23.014 --> 59:25.434
Councillor, Miss Cobden,

59:25.782 --> 59:27.346
good morning.

59:27.719 --> 59:30.091
My daughter, Mathilda.

59:31.457 --> 59:32.542
You.

59:32.567 --> 59:34.234
She has come back to me.

59:34.888 --> 59:37.336
You are the only
soul I might trust

59:37.337 --> 59:39.686
to sit with her,
for an hour only,

59:39.711 --> 59:41.094
after which I shall return.

59:41.119 --> 59:42.710
There is a wickedness

59:42.735 --> 59:45.039
it is within my power
to see corrected.

01:00:08.771 --> 01:00:10.037
Mr. Reid.

01:00:10.062 --> 01:00:12.119
I am to show you in.

01:00:19.213 --> 01:00:22.064
Capshaw, girl. Take me to him.

01:00:22.412 --> 01:00:24.191
This way, sir.

01:00:42.181 --> 01:00:44.231
Mr. Reid.

01:00:50.086 --> 01:00:51.831
Do you come with more fantasies

01:00:51.832 --> 01:00:54.200
of children rising
from their graves?

01:00:54.531 --> 01:00:57.263
No, man. I come for you.

01:00:57.952 --> 01:01:01.219
You are to accompany me
to Leman Street, now.

01:01:01.244 --> 01:01:02.869
Indeed?

01:01:04.403 --> 01:01:06.296
Am I arrested

01:01:06.957 --> 01:01:08.757
or merely aiding the police

01:01:08.782 --> 01:01:10.148
with their inquiries?

01:01:10.173 --> 01:01:11.864
I cannot say,

01:01:11.998 --> 01:01:14.635
but I am delivering you to them,

01:01:14.711 --> 01:01:16.862
along with this.

01:01:20.556 --> 01:01:21.914
Your name.

01:01:22.299 --> 01:01:24.122
ã75,000,

01:01:24.388 --> 01:01:26.234
in exchange for the
equivalent amount

01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:29.914
in U.S. bearer bonds, a
portion of that stolen

01:01:29.939 --> 01:01:32.354
from a London and
India goods train.

01:01:32.379 --> 01:01:35.162
Your name, Mr. Capshaw,

01:01:35.277 --> 01:01:38.140
writ above the murder of masses.

01:01:41.396 --> 01:01:43.714
Whitechapel is to
be rid of you, sir.

01:01:44.276 --> 01:01:47.730
Rid also of this place, this...

01:01:48.304 --> 01:01:50.076
Obsidian.

01:01:52.738 --> 01:01:53.590
You are with me,

01:01:53.615 --> 01:01:55.152
Capshaw.

01:01:56.784 --> 01:02:00.138
Rid of Obsidian, Mr. Reid?

01:02:02.259 --> 01:02:04.693
It's not as easy as
all that, I'm afraid.

01:02:05.658 --> 01:02:07.163
We are the stone

01:02:07.723 --> 01:02:09.612
and we are the brick.

01:02:12.119 --> 01:02:13.485
Needs must you demolish

01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:15.571
the whole of Whitechapel, sir.

01:02:31.586 --> 01:02:35.408
And so, Edmund Reid is ended.

01:02:38.359 --> 01:02:41.480
You are a rare one, madam.

01:02:41.906 --> 01:02:43.569
I'd begun to think you lacking

01:02:43.594 --> 01:02:46.025
the wherewithal to
support your ambitions.

01:02:46.277 --> 01:02:48.889
I need not have
disquieted myself, however.

01:02:49.292 --> 01:02:52.559
It seems the required
equipment does lie

01:02:52.584 --> 01:02:55.658
beneath those skirts
of yours, after all.

01:03:06.671 --> 01:03:08.314
This man,

01:03:08.709 --> 01:03:10.673
he was a...

01:03:12.881 --> 01:03:14.500
He was a friend to me.

01:03:15.177 --> 01:03:19.039
A friend betimes when he
had no call to be so.

01:03:20.832 --> 01:03:22.788
He was a good man.

01:03:23.089 --> 01:03:24.616
Good.

01:03:30.073 --> 01:03:33.085
Have you ever
known what that is?

01:03:33.833 --> 01:03:36.869
To be good.

01:03:38.216 --> 01:03:39.865
You

01:03:40.338 --> 01:03:43.133
you, who now dance
over him when it is I...

01:03:43.158 --> 01:03:45.916
I... who have brought
him to his end.

01:03:52.339 --> 01:03:54.869
You believe a woman
must become a man

01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:56.482
to own such an act.

01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:00.387
How little you
have learnt, Ronald.

01:04:03.132 --> 01:04:04.613
Miss Susan, what are you...?

01:04:04.638 --> 01:04:05.667
No.

01:04:09.542 --> 01:04:11.720
Please. No.

01:04:22.312 --> 01:04:24.479
You shot him, Mr. Reid,

01:04:24.504 --> 01:04:26.459
in defence, once
he had shot you.

01:04:39.868 --> 01:04:41.666
Forgive me.

01:04:41.691 --> 01:04:43.578
Forgive me.

01:04:51.296 --> 01:04:52.182
Capshaw.

01:04:52.207 --> 01:04:53.129
H-h...

01:04:53.154 --> 01:04:56.522
Help me. Help me. Help me.

01:04:57.110 --> 01:05:00.266
What has happened, Mr.
Reid? Who has done this?

01:05:00.267 --> 01:05:02.966
I'm shot. I'm shot.
