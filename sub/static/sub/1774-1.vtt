03:33.381 --> 03:36.149
OPERATOR: 911.
What's your emergency?

03:36.183 --> 03:39.186
H-Help.

03:39.219 --> 03:42.022
There's...
accident...

03:42.055 --> 03:43.691
I can't hear you.

03:43.724 --> 03:44.492
What's your location?

03:44.525 --> 03:46.026
There's been an accident.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.161
Please come now.

03:48.195 --> 03:50.798
What is the nature
of your emergency?

03:52.300 --> 03:55.936
Hello? Are you still
on the line, sir?

04:45.386 --> 04:48.322
No. Kind of ate way
too much at dinner.

04:48.356 --> 04:50.023
Oh, okay.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.258
Very special.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.461
Just a little.
All right.

04:58.566 --> 05:00.167
I'd like
to propose a toast.

05:00.200 --> 05:03.537
To Christine on her
high school graduation

05:03.571 --> 05:06.940
and her admission
to Oregon University.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.876
Cheers.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.315
Our little girl's
growing up.

05:16.249 --> 05:17.518
I love you guys.

05:17.551 --> 05:21.389
Oh, a little something
from your mom and me.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.557
Is this
what I think it is?

05:23.591 --> 05:24.825
I don't know.

05:26.394 --> 05:28.161
It's exactly
what I wanted!

05:28.195 --> 05:30.197
I think that's
enough wine for you,

05:30.230 --> 05:31.298
graduation girl.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.602
Thank you, guys.

05:39.473 --> 05:41.274
Um, well, since
we're all in such

05:41.308 --> 05:42.342
a great mood,

05:42.376 --> 05:45.145
I thought it would
be a good time for us

05:45.178 --> 05:47.347
to talk about something
that means a lot

05:47.381 --> 05:48.549
to Christine and I.

05:48.582 --> 05:53.220
Um, as you guys know,
I love her so much,

05:53.253 --> 05:55.723
and--and we really feel

05:55.756 --> 05:57.791
like now is--
is the right opportunity

05:57.825 --> 05:59.860
for us to start
our family together,

05:59.893 --> 06:05.599
and we really want
your blessing for that.

06:07.401 --> 06:09.837
I think it's important
for a young woman

06:09.870 --> 06:10.638
like Christine

06:10.671 --> 06:12.239
to finish
her education

06:12.272 --> 06:13.841
before taking
a serious step

06:13.874 --> 06:14.775
like marriage.

06:14.808 --> 06:15.943
Mom, please.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.045
I want Christine
to have her independence.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.948
James, I can't
think of anybody

06:20.981 --> 06:23.183
I'd rather have
in the family than you,

06:23.216 --> 06:25.919
but Ellen's
probably right.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.721
You both should wait.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.793
I completely
respect your guys'

06:32.826 --> 06:33.894
point of view,

06:33.927 --> 06:36.497
um, but I
feel that--

06:36.530 --> 06:38.298
that I've
been on my own since

06:38.331 --> 06:39.500
I was 15 years old,

06:39.533 --> 06:41.635
nd I have a great job
t the mill,

06:41.669 --> 06:44.905
and I know I can provide
in every way possible.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.006
James...

06:46.039 --> 06:49.543
life is far more difficult
than you realize.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.881
To this day, Doug wishes
that he had completed

06:53.914 --> 06:54.948
a proper education.

06:57.217 --> 07:00.253
Look, I know
that I didn't complete

07:00.287 --> 07:02.355
the proper education--

07:02.389 --> 07:05.058
It was my education
that allowed me

07:05.092 --> 07:06.927
to launch
a very prosperous

07:06.960 --> 07:08.261
publishing company.

07:08.295 --> 07:10.263
James, I understand
your perspective.

07:10.297 --> 07:12.399
I do. I get it,
but Ellen's right.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.803
You're both too young.
Wait.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.777
That doesn't sound good.

07:26.614 --> 07:28.816
I would like
to get home before

07:28.849 --> 07:29.783
this gets worse.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.952
James, buddy,
would you mind being

07:31.985 --> 07:33.353
the designated driver?

07:33.386 --> 07:35.255
I think you're
the only sober one

07:35.288 --> 07:36.189
at this table.

07:37.958 --> 07:41.061
Yeah, sure, Mr. Webb.
That's fine.

07:43.430 --> 07:47.000
"So foul and fair a day
I have not seen."

07:48.168 --> 07:49.469
"Macbeth."

07:58.846 --> 08:00.514
James, look,
I'm sorry, okay?

08:00.548 --> 08:03.350
I had no idea they were
gonna react that way.

08:03.383 --> 08:05.519
Yeah, well, I kind of
expected you to chime in

08:05.553 --> 08:07.755
instead of just letting your
mom tear me a new one.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.690
I mean, we talked about
what we were gonna say.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.559
Okay, but you did an amazing
job in there, okay?

08:11.592 --> 08:14.695
I'm--I didn't have any idea tha
t
it was gonna happen that way.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.964
Yeah, well...
I'll talk to her.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.700
Well, your parents are
never gonna respect me,

08:19.733 --> 08:21.702
'cause I didn't get
a precious college

08:21.735 --> 08:23.170
education like you did.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.807
That's not fair, James.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.742
Well, I know you're
just gonna go and find

08:28.776 --> 08:31.311
some trust-fund frat boy
and leave me, so--

08:31.344 --> 08:33.080
Is that what
you really think?

08:33.113 --> 08:38.418
James, you're the man
that I want to marry.

08:38.451 --> 08:41.188
I love you.
I would never do that.

08:41.221 --> 08:43.456
Okay. I'm sorry.

08:43.490 --> 08:45.225
I'm sorry, too.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.065
I love you.

08:52.099 --> 08:53.033
I love you.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.640
Christine, let's go!

08:59.673 --> 09:01.041
Watch your step now.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.718
Drive safe.

09:40.881 --> 09:43.751
Look at our sleeping
beauty up there.

09:43.784 --> 09:46.319
Doug, don't break
her present before she

09:46.353 --> 09:48.021
gets a chance to use it.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.123
Will you relax?

09:50.157 --> 09:51.659
When it rains this hard,

09:51.692 --> 09:54.127
it usually only lasts
a few minutes.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.466
'm sick
f your comments

09:59.499 --> 10:01.601
about my lack
of education in front

10:01.635 --> 10:02.736
of our daughter.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.672
I don't like your tone.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.439
My tone?

10:06.473 --> 10:07.841
Yes,
your condescending tone.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.611
You started it.
You sound like a child.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.847
Then stop treating me
like a child.

10:13.881 --> 10:14.848
James!

10:14.882 --> 10:17.350
ames, there's a train!

10:33.967 --> 10:36.303
MAN: We don't know
if there's any more

10:36.336 --> 10:37.237
brain damage.

10:37.270 --> 10:40.107
She has a small blood clot...

10:40.140 --> 10:41.441
...in her brain,

10:41.474 --> 10:43.944
so we have to keep
a close eye on her.

10:45.045 --> 10:47.547
Dr. David,
please stop

10:47.580 --> 10:49.983
in the west wing
patient lobby, Dr. David.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.384
Hi.

10:51.418 --> 10:54.187
Hey, Christine.

10:54.221 --> 10:55.655
It's me. It's Bill.

10:57.124 --> 10:59.226
Susan's here, too.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.161
Hello, sweetheart.

11:03.831 --> 11:06.199
Honey, you've been in a very
serious accident.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.706
Where's everyone else?

11:12.740 --> 11:15.242
James is
right down the hall.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.778
He's doing real good.

11:19.546 --> 11:22.382
What about Mom and Dad?

11:24.451 --> 11:29.456
Bill, what about
Mom and Dad?

11:33.393 --> 11:35.796
Bill, what happened?

11:38.565 --> 11:39.967
No.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.234
No.

11:43.670 --> 11:46.306
No. No.

12:07.360 --> 12:12.732
* Thieves come by
* I close my eyes

12:12.766 --> 12:15.668
* I fall back down

12:15.702 --> 12:18.806
* Through the scenery

12:18.839 --> 12:22.075
* And I shudder twice

12:22.109 --> 12:25.512
* Like a hollow tree
* My eyes

12:25.545 --> 12:28.515
* And the city fades

12:28.548 --> 12:31.751
* Like a candle bright

12:31.785 --> 12:34.855
* In my mirror's gaze

12:34.888 --> 12:38.892
* In a dusty light
* My eyes

12:38.926 --> 12:40.861
* And the wind, it blows

12:40.894 --> 12:43.696
* It is hot and dry

12:43.730 --> 12:47.700
* In my ears and nose

12:47.734 --> 12:50.470
* My eyes
* A desert night

12:50.503 --> 12:53.506
* I keep looking back

12:53.540 --> 12:58.111
* I keep looking back

12:58.145 --> 13:01.681
* All your days,
ll your days

13:01.714 --> 13:04.684
* All your days
are moving on

13:04.717 --> 13:07.554
* All your days,
ll your days

13:07.587 --> 13:10.891
* All your days,
they're gone, they're gone

13:10.924 --> 13:13.927
* All your days,
ll your days

13:13.961 --> 13:17.230
* All your days
are moving on

13:17.264 --> 13:20.300
* All your days,
ll your days

13:20.333 --> 13:27.174
* All your days,
they're gone, they're gone

13:27.207 --> 13:33.213
* I haven't asked you yet

13:33.246 --> 13:38.251
* All that I've tried
to give

13:38.285 --> 13:41.254
* And tried to get...

14:17.524 --> 14:18.892
Oh, my God!

14:18.926 --> 14:20.327
I'm so sorry, Dave. I--

14:20.360 --> 14:21.694
Be careful in there.

14:21.728 --> 14:23.931
I just mopped
the shower area.

14:24.898 --> 14:27.534
Okay.
I'll just be a minute.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.371
Get a move on, girl.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.406
I got places to go.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.574
Pervert.

15:48.315 --> 15:51.551
Dave, where the fuck
are my clothes?!

16:09.269 --> 16:11.604
James, pick up your phone.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.408
Come on. Come on!

16:49.676 --> 16:51.378
Oh, my God.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.034
What?

17:15.902 --> 17:17.304
No.

17:23.542 --> 17:24.977
WOMAN: Christine.

17:25.011 --> 17:27.714
No! No.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.283
Fuck.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.464
Hi, honey.
Hi.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.566
Anything from
the state lottery?

17:46.599 --> 17:47.800
No, no such luck.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.035
Rats.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.371
Oh, Christine got
a letter today, though,

17:51.404 --> 17:52.972
from the Office
of Student Housing.

17:53.005 --> 17:54.141
Huh.

17:54.174 --> 17:55.742
Looks like a dorm
probably opened up.

17:55.775 --> 17:58.945
Sounds like you're
trying to get rid of her.

17:58.978 --> 18:00.113
No.

18:00.147 --> 18:02.014
I just thought
you should know.

18:02.048 --> 18:03.516
SUSAN:
Do you want anything?

18:12.159 --> 18:13.426
Baby, what happened?

18:13.460 --> 18:15.395
What are you doing here?
Oh, my God.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.164
How did you get here?
You were there!

18:17.197 --> 18:18.165
I mean,
I don't understand!

18:18.198 --> 18:19.366
What are you
talking about?

18:19.399 --> 18:20.367
At the pool!

18:20.400 --> 18:21.368
The pool?

18:21.401 --> 18:22.869
I--I heard your
cellphone ring there.

18:22.902 --> 18:24.504
My cellphone?
I told you yesterday

18:24.537 --> 18:26.539
it got stolen
at the mill, remember?

18:26.573 --> 18:28.541
I put it on the table,
and somebody took it.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.076
I don't know
what happened to it.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.511
Okay, okay.
Calm down, okay?

18:31.544 --> 18:32.312
Take a breath.

18:32.345 --> 18:33.546
I am breathing, okay?

18:33.580 --> 18:35.315
Okay, well--
You don't understand, okay?

18:35.348 --> 18:37.517
My clothes were stolen,
and I tried to call you

18:37.550 --> 18:40.320
to get you to help me, a-and
your cellphone rang there.

18:40.353 --> 18:41.988
And then somebody knocked me
in the pool, and then they

18:42.021 --> 18:42.955
chased me to the car!

18:42.989 --> 18:44.090
Hey, hey, hey!
What's going on?

18:44.123 --> 18:45.425
How'd you get
in here, asshole?

18:45.458 --> 18:47.126
Bill, just, please,
it's my fault, okay?

18:47.160 --> 18:48.228
I'll explain later.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.429
Yeah, thanks
for the backup, Bill.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.830
I got this one
under control.

18:50.863 --> 18:53.166
Bill, please.
Guys, stop.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.636
Just please leave.

18:58.471 --> 18:59.772
Dickhead.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.542
Sweetie...

19:03.443 --> 19:04.611
I didn't mean
to scare you.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.613
I know.
I'm glad you're here.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.449
I just wasn't expecting you,
that's all.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.383
Hey...

19:10.417 --> 19:12.652
It doesn't make sense.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.258
Who do you think did it?

19:18.291 --> 19:20.059
I don't know.

19:20.092 --> 19:21.861
I don't really
want to talk about it

19:21.894 --> 19:23.029
anymore, though, okay?

19:23.062 --> 19:24.731
Okay, that's fine.

19:24.764 --> 19:25.898
I just want
to go to sleep.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.267
All right.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.538
Sorry.

19:31.571 --> 19:33.206
It's all right.

19:35.642 --> 19:36.909
Okay, night.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.683
What are you doing?

20:52.251 --> 20:53.586
Nothing.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.955
Thought you
were going out.

20:55.988 --> 20:57.724
Yeah.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.694
I am.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.137
Here you go.
How's that?

21:11.170 --> 21:12.138
Thank you.

21:12.171 --> 21:13.139
Of course.

21:13.172 --> 21:15.508
It's good to see you.

21:15.542 --> 21:20.647
So, Mr. Anderson,
how's Ryan doing?

21:23.316 --> 21:25.985
As you know, he's still
at the university

21:26.018 --> 21:27.387
studying
English literature,

21:27.420 --> 21:28.855
and, uh, he's getting
pretty good grades,

21:28.888 --> 21:31.123
but he still doesn't
have a social life,

21:31.157 --> 21:33.059
and he spends
most of his time just

21:33.092 --> 21:34.361
locked up in his room.

21:34.394 --> 21:36.763
Have there been
any improvements

21:36.796 --> 21:37.997
in his behavior?

21:38.030 --> 21:40.433
No.

21:40.467 --> 21:43.235
In fact,
it's getting worse.

21:43.269 --> 21:45.805
Worse in--in what way?

21:45.838 --> 21:48.040
The violent behavior.

21:51.411 --> 21:53.145
Dr. Webb,
I'm getting concerned

21:53.179 --> 21:55.348
for the safety
of my daughter.

21:55.382 --> 21:57.717
So based on
your sessions with him,

21:57.750 --> 22:00.219
what's--
what's wrong with him?

22:00.252 --> 22:02.355
Well...

22:02.389 --> 22:05.625
Ryan is suffering
from extreme bouts

22:05.658 --> 22:06.726
of frustration

22:06.759 --> 22:10.196
that are accompanied
by a very distorted

22:10.229 --> 22:11.898
sense of reality.

22:11.931 --> 22:14.467
Uh, during these episodes,

22:14.501 --> 22:18.104
he is unable to distinguish
real from unreal.

22:19.706 --> 22:24.076
In other words, your son
has delusional paranoia.

22:27.079 --> 22:29.181
Dr. Webb, before we
go any further,

22:29.215 --> 22:31.851
there's some things
you need to know.

22:34.821 --> 22:38.425
Well, the truth is
my wife disappeared

22:38.458 --> 22:40.927
under what they
called suspicious

22:40.960 --> 22:42.094
circumstances,

22:42.128 --> 22:44.263
and to this day,
no one knows what

22:44.296 --> 22:45.832
really happened to her.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.468
What was their relationship
at the time?

22:54.240 --> 22:56.743
WOMAN: You're sick!
You need help!

22:56.776 --> 22:58.210
BOY: There's nothing
wrong with me!

22:58.244 --> 23:00.279
Stop it, Ryan!
Leave me alone!

23:00.312 --> 23:02.148
Stop it!
Let go of me!

23:02.181 --> 23:04.183
Ryan,
you're hurting me!

23:13.325 --> 23:15.061
Ryan,
unlock the door!

23:15.094 --> 23:16.929
I'm okay, Dad.

23:16.963 --> 23:18.264
Damn it,
you open this door

23:18.297 --> 23:19.298
right now!

23:19.331 --> 23:21.534
Dad, I'm okay.
It was a nightmare.

23:24.370 --> 23:26.172
Ryan, listen to me,
buddy.

23:26.205 --> 23:29.341
Just listen
to me, please.

23:29.375 --> 23:31.177
You can't
do this anymore.

23:31.210 --> 23:33.179
ow I want you
o unlock the door,

23:33.212 --> 23:35.147
and I want you
to let me in.

23:35.181 --> 23:37.950
Dad, go back to bed.

23:39.251 --> 23:43.022
Ryan, talk to me.

23:43.055 --> 23:45.492
Go back to fucking bed!

23:59.606 --> 24:01.007
I can't peek?

24:01.040 --> 24:03.442
No peeking.
None of that.

24:03.476 --> 24:05.444
Okay, don't trip.
Don't trip. Whoa.

24:05.478 --> 24:06.846
Whoa what?
I'll tell you.

24:06.879 --> 24:08.815
'll tell you.
'll tell you.

24:08.848 --> 24:09.816
Ready?
Okay.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.355
Check it out.

24:16.388 --> 24:18.090
What do you think,
huh?

24:18.124 --> 24:19.626
Whose is this?

24:19.659 --> 24:22.394
This is the bedroom
right here, okay?

24:22.428 --> 24:23.496
Okay.

24:23.530 --> 24:28.400
And we got campus
two blocks away,

24:28.434 --> 24:31.403
nd we got plenty
f time to furnish it,

24:31.437 --> 24:34.841
and when we're married,
you can move in.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.008
It's amazing.

24:36.042 --> 24:36.976
Yeah?
Yeah.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.845
You like it?
Mm-hmm.

24:38.878 --> 24:40.246
Thank you.

24:56.663 --> 24:59.799
JAMES: I can't wait
to marry you.

25:05.938 --> 25:08.340
This has been
the most amazing day ever.

25:08.374 --> 25:09.742
Well, I got you,
didn't I?

25:09.776 --> 25:11.177
I wasn't expecting it.

25:12.579 --> 25:15.114
James, what
would you do

25:15.147 --> 25:16.916
if you lost me?

25:16.949 --> 25:18.851
What?

25:20.319 --> 25:21.453
Could you ever
fall in love

25:21.487 --> 25:22.622
with someone else?

25:24.724 --> 25:26.559
I don't think I could,
and I need to know

25:26.593 --> 25:27.894
that you feel the same.

25:28.828 --> 25:30.630
How could you
even ask me that?

25:30.663 --> 25:33.165
I proposed to you,
didn't I?

25:33.199 --> 25:34.967
I know.

25:35.001 --> 25:37.570
I love you.

25:37.604 --> 25:39.538
I love you.

25:42.609 --> 25:45.144
Do I get to pick
my fiancée up for dinner

25:45.177 --> 25:46.212
tomorrow night?

25:46.245 --> 25:47.614
No. I want
to cook for us

25:47.647 --> 25:49.181
tomorrow night, okay?

25:49.215 --> 25:51.417
Okay. I get off
at, like, 5:00.

25:51.450 --> 25:53.385
Okay. Just
come over after.

25:53.419 --> 25:54.587
All right.
Okay.

26:24.416 --> 26:25.952
MAN: Christine.

26:27.620 --> 26:30.256
ive me the ring.

26:30.289 --> 26:32.992
Give me
the fucking ring!

26:34.593 --> 26:36.362
Oh, my God.

26:37.463 --> 26:39.065
Open the door!
Open the door!

26:39.098 --> 26:41.267
Bill! Open the door!

26:41.300 --> 26:42.935
Open the--
Oh, my God.

26:59.585 --> 27:01.420
You're wide awake.

27:01.453 --> 27:03.823
What are
you thinking?

27:03.856 --> 27:07.727
Just wondering
who'd stalk my sister.

27:07.760 --> 27:11.263
Are you sure that's
what's happened?

27:11.297 --> 27:13.432
What does that mean?

27:13.465 --> 27:16.335
Ever since the accident,

27:16.368 --> 27:18.470
she's been
displaying signs of

27:18.504 --> 27:20.272
post-traumatic stress.

27:21.874 --> 27:23.609
I really think
she needs help from

27:23.642 --> 27:24.877
a professional, honey.

27:24.911 --> 27:26.645
I really think
she's a strong girl,

27:26.679 --> 27:28.614
and she just needs
our support.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.117
She has our support.
I...

27:32.685 --> 27:35.955
I just wish
you'd think about it.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.656
Yeah, sure.

27:37.690 --> 27:39.759
Thank you.

27:43.763 --> 27:46.298
You know
what tonight is?

27:49.535 --> 27:52.772
It's a prime night.

27:52.805 --> 27:54.941
You want to try?

27:56.575 --> 27:58.911
Um, sure.

28:56.035 --> 28:57.770
James.

28:57.804 --> 28:59.939
Babe, what are
you doing here?

29:01.173 --> 29:02.809
Sweetie, it's dangerous
for you to be here.

29:02.842 --> 29:05.878
I told you that. You're not
supposed to come here.

29:05.912 --> 29:08.314
Please don't be
mad at me, okay?

29:08.347 --> 29:10.783
What is it?

29:10.817 --> 29:13.886
James,
my ring was stolen.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.858
W-When?

29:19.758 --> 29:21.427
Last night
after you left,

29:21.460 --> 29:23.295
omeone came
fter me again.

29:23.329 --> 29:25.564
Why didn't you tell me?

29:25.597 --> 29:26.899
Who was it?

29:26.933 --> 29:28.234
Was it the guy
from the pool?

29:28.267 --> 29:30.102
I can't tell you, James.
I can't tell you,

29:30.136 --> 29:31.737
'cause you're gonna think
that I'm crazy, okay?

29:31.770 --> 29:33.305
Baby, no, I'm not.

29:33.339 --> 29:34.740
I'm not.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.142
What is it?

29:41.447 --> 29:43.649
James, I saw my father.

29:43.682 --> 29:45.751
My father was there, okay?

29:45.784 --> 29:48.787
He's the one who took
the ring from me.

29:50.356 --> 29:52.825
I don't understand.

30:09.275 --> 30:10.576
So be honest.

30:10.609 --> 30:12.578
Do you think
I'm going crazy?

30:12.611 --> 30:15.114
Sweetie,
you're not crazy.

30:50.449 --> 30:52.184
What the hell?

30:56.288 --> 30:57.556
I'm on it!

31:12.471 --> 31:15.707
James!

31:15.741 --> 31:16.742
James!

31:16.775 --> 31:18.310
Help me! James!

31:18.344 --> 31:20.612
Could somebody just
fucking help me!

31:20.646 --> 31:22.614
Wait. What--
Somebody!

31:22.648 --> 31:23.815
What's going on?

31:23.849 --> 31:24.816
saw him again!
hat's--

31:24.850 --> 31:26.052
I saw him!
He was in here!

31:26.085 --> 31:27.586
He was in here!
Who was in here?

31:27.619 --> 31:28.988
Is there somebody
in this house?

31:29.021 --> 31:30.489
s there somebody
n my house?!

31:30.522 --> 31:32.458
Yes!

31:32.491 --> 31:33.625
I saw him.

31:37.029 --> 31:39.932
James, come with me.

31:51.843 --> 31:54.246
Okay, Ed. Yeah, thanks.
Thanks a lot.

31:55.514 --> 31:57.149
What did he say,
honey?

31:57.183 --> 31:59.885
Said he's gonna
keep an eye on her

31:59.918 --> 32:02.121
till we figure out
what's going on.

32:02.154 --> 32:04.290
don't know
hat's going on.

32:04.323 --> 32:06.392
We checked the place
up and down.

32:06.425 --> 32:08.427
I couldn't find
a handprint, footprint,

32:08.460 --> 32:10.029
broken lock, nothing.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.200
Honey, this is
the third episode

32:14.233 --> 32:16.635
without any evidence
of an actual threat.

32:16.668 --> 32:19.005
Meaning what?

32:19.038 --> 32:20.906
Well, you know
hallucinations

32:20.939 --> 32:23.809
are a sure sign
to a psychotic break.

32:23.842 --> 32:25.677
Psychotic break?
Listen to you.

32:25.711 --> 32:26.745
What?

32:26.778 --> 32:28.514
She's not making
this shit up.

32:28.547 --> 32:30.282
I'm not saying she is.

32:30.316 --> 32:31.883
Why does this have
to be about Christine?

32:31.917 --> 32:33.452
It was dark. Anyone could
have been there.

32:33.485 --> 32:35.121
Where was James when
the lights went out?

32:35.154 --> 32:36.322
You're taking this
the wrong way.

32:36.355 --> 32:37.956
You know, I gotta
be honest with you.

32:37.990 --> 32:39.891
I think you're
jealous of her.

32:39.925 --> 32:43.795
You think--
I'm jealous of Christine?

32:43.829 --> 32:46.365
Why would I be jealous
of Christine?

32:46.398 --> 32:48.334
Because she's
getting married,

32:48.367 --> 32:50.136
gonna have a family
of her own,

32:50.169 --> 32:51.337
and apparently
that's something

32:51.370 --> 32:53.405
that we're having
a hard time doing.

32:54.940 --> 32:56.475
Fuck you, Bill!

32:56.508 --> 32:58.377
uck you!

32:59.845 --> 33:01.013
Fuck you.

33:21.967 --> 33:25.637
ELLEN: By the pricking
of my thumbs,

33:25.671 --> 33:30.042
something wicked
this way comes.

33:44.790 --> 33:48.827
You destroyed our family.

33:48.860 --> 33:51.463
How dare you disobey me?

33:51.497 --> 33:52.631
You're a disgrace.

33:52.664 --> 33:55.067
Lying whore.

34:28.567 --> 34:30.469
BILL: Susan!

34:30.502 --> 34:31.536
Susan!

34:33.605 --> 34:35.873
My gun is missing!

34:35.907 --> 34:37.909
Okay, I'm sorry
about last night,

34:37.943 --> 34:39.945
but did you
take my gun?

34:39.978 --> 34:41.780
Yeah.

34:41.813 --> 34:43.949
I was planning
on shooting you

34:43.982 --> 34:46.051
in your sleep
last night.

34:46.083 --> 34:47.985
This is not funny.
This is serious.

34:48.018 --> 34:50.188
I can be suspended
for a lost firearm.

34:50.222 --> 34:54.159
Okay, look,
I didn't take the gun.

34:54.193 --> 34:55.694
It's probably
around the house.

34:55.726 --> 34:57.129
I'm telling you
I've looked everywhere!

34:57.163 --> 34:58.964
It is not here!

34:58.997 --> 35:01.700
Okay, last night,
when the lights went out,

35:01.733 --> 35:02.668
where was it?

35:02.701 --> 35:05.271
I know where it was.

35:09.675 --> 35:11.177
Prick.

35:13.379 --> 35:15.547
Campus security.
Ed Young's office.

35:15.581 --> 35:17.616
I'm sorry, Mr. Webb.
He's in a meeting

35:17.649 --> 35:18.450
right now...

35:18.484 --> 35:20.519
So then I got out
of the pool, and...

35:20.552 --> 35:23.121
Mm-hmm. Watch this.

35:23.155 --> 35:24.923
Never turns toward
the security cameras.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.124
Never shows his face.

35:26.158 --> 35:28.394
This is somebody
who knows the building,

35:28.427 --> 35:30.762
knows the setup,
where the cameras are.

35:30.796 --> 35:32.864
Is there any way
to enhance this?

35:32.898 --> 35:34.132
No. It's too dark.

35:34.166 --> 35:35.667
But don't worry about it.

35:35.701 --> 35:37.803
We turned it over
to local law enforcement.

35:37.836 --> 35:39.605
hey're better equipped
o handle this stuff.

35:39.638 --> 35:41.507
Yeah. Thanks.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.309
I appreciate it.

35:44.343 --> 35:46.245
You'll be hearing
from a detective

35:46.278 --> 35:48.113
later this week,
okay?

35:48.146 --> 35:49.615
Bye.
Bye.

36:04.663 --> 36:05.897
Hey, Bill. It's Ed.

36:05.931 --> 36:07.098
Oh, hey, Ed.

36:07.132 --> 36:08.667
Did you get a chance
to talk to Christine?

36:08.700 --> 36:10.302
Yeah. She just left.
Could you I.D. anyone?

36:10.336 --> 36:11.803
Nah, but I
know who it is.

36:11.837 --> 36:13.605
Tell me
it's James Campbell,

36:13.639 --> 36:15.207
'cause I need a reason
to put a bullet

36:15.241 --> 36:16.141
in that kid's head.

36:16.174 --> 36:17.276
Who?
Her boyfriend.

36:17.309 --> 36:18.977
I heard them arguing
after the attack.

36:19.010 --> 36:19.878
She can place
his cellphone

36:19.911 --> 36:21.046
at the scene that night.

36:21.079 --> 36:22.381
She never mentioned that.
She's in denial.

36:22.414 --> 36:23.682
That's interesting,

36:23.715 --> 36:26.952
'cause I got
two hooded suspects on tape.

36:26.985 --> 36:29.154
What?

36:29.187 --> 36:32.224
I'm thinking both of our boys
were at the pool

36:32.258 --> 36:33.592
the other night.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.428
Call you back. I gotta go.

36:36.462 --> 36:38.764
Okay, Ed. Thanks a lot.

36:40.699 --> 36:41.467
Everything okay?

36:41.500 --> 36:43.802
Yeah. Yeah, it's good.

36:43.835 --> 36:46.305
So how long
is your shift?

36:46.338 --> 36:48.840
My shift, Donna?

36:48.874 --> 36:50.942
y shift lasts all night.

36:50.976 --> 36:52.077
Oh.

36:52.110 --> 36:53.945
See about that, huh?

37:01.687 --> 37:02.754
Johnson!

37:02.788 --> 37:03.755
Dave Johnson!

37:06.492 --> 37:07.726
Hey. Unh!

37:29.080 --> 37:30.982
Johnson!

37:35.020 --> 37:36.455
Johnson!

38:10.055 --> 38:12.190
Aah!

38:32.077 --> 38:36.047
* Sitting here with you

38:46.392 --> 38:48.560
* Such a simple scene...
Come in.

38:50.195 --> 38:51.630
Hey, sweetheart.

38:52.731 --> 38:54.132
Hi.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.368
You want to talk?

38:57.569 --> 38:58.404
Sure.

38:58.437 --> 38:59.671
* A silent plea

39:01.540 --> 39:08.013
* Would you stay with me?

39:09.080 --> 39:11.016
* Is this our world...

39:11.049 --> 39:12.518
I miss them so much.

39:15.020 --> 39:16.354
Sometimes I want
to wake up,

39:16.388 --> 39:18.424
and it'd all
just be a bad dream.

39:18.457 --> 39:21.660
* Stay with me...

39:21.693 --> 39:25.263
Life can be
so cruel sometimes.

39:25.296 --> 39:27.365
Yeah.

39:28.233 --> 39:29.668
What's that?

39:29.701 --> 39:33.405
Pictures
from my graduation.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.708
They're
the last pictures

39:36.742 --> 39:37.843
I have of them.

39:38.777 --> 39:41.447
My family was
everything to me.

39:43.949 --> 39:47.453
I want to have a family
with James one day.

39:47.486 --> 39:53.224
want to have kids
nd grow old together.

39:53.258 --> 39:54.926
That's my dream, too.

39:57.362 --> 39:59.431
Might not ever happen.

40:01.366 --> 40:03.735
You may not
know this, but...

40:03.769 --> 40:07.372
I made a promise
to my mom and to myself

40:07.405 --> 40:10.008
that I wouldn't
be intimate with a guy

40:10.041 --> 40:11.577
until I was married.

40:12.678 --> 40:15.481
That's a really
tough promise to keep.

40:15.514 --> 40:17.483
I'm proud of you.

40:18.484 --> 40:19.851
I just can't believe

40:19.885 --> 40:22.253
they're not gonna be
there on my wedding day.

40:22.287 --> 40:24.556
* Stay with me...

40:24.590 --> 40:26.925
My dad won't be
there to--

40:26.958 --> 40:28.494
to walk me
down the aisle

40:28.527 --> 40:29.795
and give me away,

40:29.828 --> 40:32.798
and my mom won't
be there to help me

40:32.831 --> 40:34.265
pick out my dress.

40:34.299 --> 40:36.234
They will be there.

40:36.267 --> 40:39.738
They wouldn't miss it
for the world.

40:42.608 --> 40:44.442
You have to believe me.

40:44.476 --> 40:45.944
I promise.

40:48.013 --> 40:49.815
Thanks.

40:50.949 --> 40:53.952
* All the faces
that I've known...

40:53.985 --> 40:55.621
All right, come on.

40:55.654 --> 40:57.989
Let's put
this stuff away.

40:58.023 --> 41:00.025
Yeah. Yeah.

41:01.126 --> 41:03.328
Get some rest.

41:03.361 --> 41:04.530
Yeah.

41:04.563 --> 41:07.432
Ah, I got it.
I got it.

41:07.465 --> 41:10.936
* 'Cause our world
can be so lonely

41:53.078 --> 41:56.047
Excuse me.
Officer Webb?

41:56.081 --> 41:57.482
Do I know you?

41:57.515 --> 41:59.885
I'm Sergeant Ellis
with Internal Affairs.

41:59.918 --> 42:02.020
Please step
out of the vehicle.

42:10.161 --> 42:11.630
What's this about?

42:11.663 --> 42:14.299
Do you know a member
of the EPD by the name

42:14.332 --> 42:15.200
of Ed Young?

42:15.233 --> 42:16.835
Yeah. So?

42:16.868 --> 42:18.637
When was the last time
you had any contact

42:18.670 --> 42:19.771
with Officer Young?

42:21.072 --> 42:22.373
Called him last night.

42:22.407 --> 42:23.809
I didn't reach him. Why?

42:23.842 --> 42:27.045
Officer Young is dead,
Mr. Webb.

42:27.078 --> 42:28.513
What?

42:28.546 --> 42:30.749
He was killed yesterday.

42:30.782 --> 42:32.751
An Oregon State Police
service revolver

42:32.784 --> 42:36.021
registered in your name
was found at the scene.

42:36.054 --> 42:37.288
My gun was stolen.

42:37.322 --> 42:38.857
I've read the reports.

42:38.890 --> 42:42.293
Excessive force
three times.

42:42.327 --> 42:43.829
Questionable shootings.

42:43.862 --> 42:46.131
This conversation is over.

42:52.704 --> 42:55.941
* The end is
always messy, baby

42:55.974 --> 42:59.678
* And, yeah, just,
just a little longer

42:59.711 --> 43:03.281
* Are you trying
to drive me crazy?

43:03.314 --> 43:06.918
* Am I not the only one?

43:06.952 --> 43:10.388
* My friends say
I'm all you talk about...

43:15.861 --> 43:20.398
* Could search you and
the other way around

43:21.667 --> 43:23.368
* You're playing
tricks on me

43:23.401 --> 43:24.970
* On me

43:25.003 --> 43:26.371
* Tricks on me

43:26.404 --> 43:28.173
* On me

43:28.206 --> 43:32.010
* And now I see you,
now I don't...

43:32.043 --> 43:34.245
James, stop.

43:34.279 --> 43:36.547
You're being bad.

43:36.581 --> 43:39.284
* On me

43:39.317 --> 43:40.919
Baby, don't.

43:40.952 --> 43:43.054
Don't. Mm.

43:43.088 --> 43:45.190
No, James. Stop!

43:47.993 --> 43:50.195
Get off her, asshole.
What the--

43:50.228 --> 43:51.963
hat the fuck, man?

43:51.997 --> 43:53.899
* On me...

43:53.932 --> 43:55.600
Bill, what are
you doing?

43:55.633 --> 43:57.335
You could have
hurt him!

43:57.368 --> 43:58.904
Are you
following me? Bill?!

43:58.937 --> 44:00.205
Yes, I'm following you.

44:00.238 --> 44:03.074
This lover boy's
in some serious shit,

44:03.108 --> 44:04.676
and now we both are.

44:04.710 --> 44:06.812
Ed Young's been killed,

44:06.845 --> 44:09.247
and my weapon and
James' cellphone

44:09.280 --> 44:10.882
were found at the scene.

44:10.916 --> 44:12.117
Yeah, well,
his cellphone was

44:12.150 --> 44:12.818
stolen the other day,

44:12.851 --> 44:14.085
so obviously
it wasn't him.

44:14.119 --> 44:15.620
And you believe that?

44:15.653 --> 44:17.388
Yeah, I do believe that.

44:19.024 --> 44:22.527
Well, for your sake,
I hope he can prove it.

44:22.560 --> 44:25.663
* On me, on me

44:25.697 --> 44:27.365
* Playing tricks on me

44:28.466 --> 44:29.400
* Playing...

44:41.446 --> 44:43.148
Hey, so listen,
I got a call from

44:43.181 --> 44:44.149
a detective yesterday.

44:44.182 --> 44:45.984
He asked if you were
working here Thursday.

44:46.017 --> 44:47.052
Ah, shit.
Are you serious?

44:47.085 --> 44:48.720
No worries.
I covered for you.

44:48.754 --> 44:50.055
Ah, thank you,
Mr. Anderson.

44:50.088 --> 44:52.457
Hey, listen,
I don't want you working

44:52.490 --> 44:54.392
with your head
hurting like that.

44:54.425 --> 44:56.394
Damn,
that was a cheap shot.

44:56.427 --> 44:57.628
You listen to me.
If that Bill Webb

44:57.662 --> 44:58.964
gives you
any more trouble,

44:58.997 --> 45:00.398
if he even
looks at you funny,

45:00.431 --> 45:01.466
you let me know,

45:01.499 --> 45:02.801
'cause I got
some boys that'll put

45:02.834 --> 45:03.802
some manners on him.

45:03.835 --> 45:06.371
Might have to
take you up on that.

45:07.739 --> 45:09.574
Hey, could I ask you
something, Mr. Anderson?

45:09.607 --> 45:11.509
Shoot.

45:11.542 --> 45:14.045
Why you always
looking out for me?

45:14.079 --> 45:17.983
Well, sometimes,
I look at you,

45:18.016 --> 45:19.785
and I see
a little bit of me

45:19.818 --> 45:21.319
when I was your age.

45:21.352 --> 45:22.921
Tell you the truth,

45:22.954 --> 45:25.223
I been hoping some
of that would rub off

45:25.256 --> 45:26.224
on my son, but...

45:27.625 --> 45:29.961
Anyway, help Ryan with
the overnight shipment.

45:29.995 --> 45:31.930
Then you take the rest
of the day off, okay?

45:31.963 --> 45:33.131
Okay. I appreciate it.
Ryan!

45:33.164 --> 45:34.599
Yeah?

45:34.632 --> 45:36.034
Come help James.

45:36.067 --> 45:37.235
Sure.

45:52.017 --> 45:54.652
So my dad says
you got engaged.

45:54.685 --> 45:56.721
Congratulations.

45:56.754 --> 45:58.156
Yeah. Thanks, man.

45:58.189 --> 46:00.025
She's hot.

46:04.162 --> 46:07.132
I see her on campus
from time to time.

46:07.165 --> 46:09.400
I bet you do.

46:10.601 --> 46:12.270
I'll have
to introduce myself

46:12.303 --> 46:14.005
next time I see her.

46:15.173 --> 46:16.407
Yeah, you should.

47:18.970 --> 47:20.571
ELLEN: Hi, sweetheart.

47:20.605 --> 47:23.441
Let me know what time you'll
be home for dinner tonight.

47:23.474 --> 47:24.509
Love you.

47:25.676 --> 47:27.578
ELLEN, ECHOING:
No more tears now.

47:27.612 --> 47:29.847
I will think
upon revenge.

47:31.182 --> 47:32.717
I'm sorry.

47:32.750 --> 47:35.620
I know
it's my fault.

47:35.653 --> 47:38.924
* I just want
to stand with you

47:39.958 --> 47:41.659
* Let you know I care...

47:41.692 --> 47:43.661
Hello, Bill.

47:43.694 --> 47:46.464
I knew
I'd find you here.

47:46.497 --> 47:48.133
You think you know me.

47:49.901 --> 47:51.636
Listen, I know we
didn't grow up together,

47:51.669 --> 47:53.338
and I was in the Army
by the time that

47:53.371 --> 47:54.172
you were born,

47:54.205 --> 47:56.141
but, uh, I just
thought I would try--

47:56.174 --> 47:57.808
They're trying to stop me.

47:57.842 --> 47:59.544
What?

47:59.577 --> 48:00.946
The messages,

48:00.979 --> 48:03.014
they're from
Shakespeare's tragedies,

48:03.048 --> 48:07.352
all the stories of evil deeds
and doomed love.

48:10.021 --> 48:11.656
What has that
got to do with--

48:11.689 --> 48:13.824
Mom's favorite thing
in life,

48:13.858 --> 48:16.427
her passion was poetry.

48:17.728 --> 48:20.065
Can I give you a little
brotherly advice?

48:20.098 --> 48:22.968
Don't let
your feelings for James

48:23.001 --> 48:25.536
blind you to what's
really going on.

48:26.604 --> 48:27.738
I mean, these threats

48:27.772 --> 48:29.340
aren't coming
from beyond the grave.

48:29.374 --> 48:30.375
No, it's not James.

48:32.043 --> 48:34.045
It's Shakespeare.

48:34.079 --> 48:36.247
She's trying to warn me.

48:39.684 --> 48:44.189
* I couldn't hope that you

48:44.222 --> 48:48.526
* Could throw this out

48:48.559 --> 48:50.395
* Away...

49:16.421 --> 49:17.288
Hello.

49:17.322 --> 49:19.590
Hey, James has
been in an accident.

49:19.624 --> 49:20.858
He's at the hospital.

49:20.891 --> 49:23.128
Oh, my God.
I'll be right there.

49:23.161 --> 49:25.296
James has been
in an accident.

49:26.397 --> 49:28.399
What? What happened?

49:28.433 --> 49:30.201
Christine, wait!

49:33.304 --> 49:35.906
Code blue,
room 203.

49:35.940 --> 49:37.275
Code blue, room 203.

49:37.308 --> 49:38.709
CHRISTINE: Yes.
It's on your right.

49:38.743 --> 49:40.278
Okay, thanks.

49:41.412 --> 49:42.813
y God, James.

49:42.847 --> 49:44.582
My God!

49:44.615 --> 49:45.650
You okay?
Sweetie.

49:45.683 --> 49:46.651
What happened?

49:46.684 --> 49:47.852
I'm okay.

49:47.885 --> 49:50.621
All right, somebody
ran me off the road,

49:50.655 --> 49:52.757
but the doctors
checked me out,

49:52.790 --> 49:54.259
and I'm
gonna be fine.

49:54.292 --> 49:56.861
You don't understand.
I can't lose you.

49:56.894 --> 49:58.863
I know, sweetie.

49:58.896 --> 50:00.098
It's okay.

50:03.901 --> 50:05.936
Baby, you're
the only thing I care

50:05.970 --> 50:07.405
about in this world.

50:09.174 --> 50:11.709
I mean, why are we
waiting to get married?

50:14.011 --> 50:16.047
I don't know.

50:16.081 --> 50:17.948
Let's just do it.

50:17.982 --> 50:20.885
I don't want to spend
another day without you.

50:20.918 --> 50:22.787
Okay.

50:22.820 --> 50:24.189
This mean...

50:24.222 --> 50:25.356
Yeah.

50:25.390 --> 50:27.158
Okay.

50:30.628 --> 50:32.130
Love you.

50:36.734 --> 50:38.636
I love you more.

51:09.434 --> 51:11.902
Are you ready
to kill for me?

51:11.936 --> 51:14.205
I'd die for you.

51:14.239 --> 51:15.906
Are you sure about that?

51:15.940 --> 51:17.375
Yeah.

51:29.120 --> 51:30.921
You okay?

51:30.955 --> 51:32.022
Hey, hey, hey.

51:32.056 --> 51:33.191
Leave me alone!

51:46.237 --> 51:48.373
Oh, for God's sake.

51:54.179 --> 51:58.183
* It doesn't matter
what I do

51:58.216 --> 52:00.451
* Or how I try

52:00.485 --> 52:01.919
* I can never
be what you

52:01.952 --> 52:02.853
wanted me to be

52:02.887 --> 52:04.889
* You tell me when to...

52:07.124 --> 52:09.360
Dr. Webb,
it's John Anderson.

52:09.394 --> 52:11.996
Uh, I'm sorry
for the short notice,

52:12.029 --> 52:13.564
but is there
any chance you could

52:13.598 --> 52:14.565
meet with me today?

52:14.599 --> 52:15.966
I'm booked today.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.368
Will tomorrow work?

52:17.402 --> 52:19.504
Uh, it's--it's important,

52:19.537 --> 52:22.340
and I just need to talk
to you for a few minutes.

52:22.373 --> 52:24.375
I gotta get this
figured out.

52:24.409 --> 52:26.143
I'm ready
to discuss more--

52:26.177 --> 52:27.578
more ways of treatment.

52:27.612 --> 52:28.579
What's going on?

52:32.317 --> 52:33.851
I'm afraid Ryan
put my daughter

52:33.884 --> 52:36.053
in some real jeopardy
this time.

52:36.086 --> 52:38.589
Oh, God.
What happened?

52:38.623 --> 52:41.726
I'm meeting with detectives
tonight to figure it out.

52:41.759 --> 52:43.127
A female student
was attacked

52:43.160 --> 52:45.095
at the university pool
last week.

52:45.129 --> 52:47.131
Cops say they
can I.D. my daughter

52:47.164 --> 52:48.233
outside the pool

52:48.266 --> 52:50.401
at the time
of the attack.

52:52.270 --> 52:54.572
Dr. Webb?
Are you still there?

52:54.605 --> 52:57.275
Let's meet at the Crescent
Café at 10:00.

52:57.308 --> 53:00.211
Thank you, Doctor.
I appreciate it.

53:03.248 --> 53:05.816
GIRL:
Ryan, Dave's here!

53:08.986 --> 53:11.456
* Then I sit and watch

53:11.489 --> 53:13.958
* As you self-medicate

53:13.991 --> 53:15.025
* Never pull me down,

53:15.059 --> 53:16.894
* Calling
to your disease

53:16.927 --> 53:20.931
* As I fall down
into your...

53:20.965 --> 53:22.333
Hey.

53:22.367 --> 53:24.802
I need to borrow
your car Saturday.

53:24.835 --> 53:26.136
Done.

53:26.170 --> 53:31.309
* And now we both
live broken lives...

53:31.342 --> 53:33.110
What's wrong
with your truck?

53:33.143 --> 53:34.779
It won't start.

53:35.880 --> 53:40.351
* World of endless lies

53:40.385 --> 53:42.387
Zeal, let's go, honey!

53:47.792 --> 53:48.593
Morning, Pop!

53:48.626 --> 53:51.228
You scared me, baby.

53:51.262 --> 53:53.130
You trying to give me
a heart attack?

53:53.163 --> 53:54.465
Ah, you ready
for school?

53:54.499 --> 53:55.266
Yep.

53:55.300 --> 53:56.867
What do you got there?

53:56.901 --> 53:58.303
It's my disguise.

53:58.336 --> 54:01.539
Your disguise, huh?
Can I see it?

54:01.572 --> 54:03.741
It's a secret.
I can't show you.

54:03.774 --> 54:04.809
It's a secret?

54:04.842 --> 54:07.412
You're gonna keep
a secret from your dad?

54:07.445 --> 54:08.813
Ryan said
he's teaching me to be

54:08.846 --> 54:09.780
his partner in crime.

54:09.814 --> 54:11.148
He did, huh?
Yeah, I want

54:11.181 --> 54:12.149
to talk to you

54:12.182 --> 54:13.684
about that
on the way to school.

54:16.887 --> 54:17.855
Hey, Donna.

54:17.888 --> 54:19.023
Hey, hon,
you got a second?

54:19.056 --> 54:21.459
Yeah, what's up?

54:21.492 --> 54:22.860
Look, I'm meeting
Susan in a minute

54:22.893 --> 54:23.761
to discuss Christine.

54:23.794 --> 54:25.162
Is everything okay?

54:25.195 --> 54:26.464
Bill, I can't live
like this anymore,

54:26.497 --> 54:28.599
and I want this
resolved tonight.

54:28.633 --> 54:29.400
What? Tonight?

54:29.434 --> 54:31.436
Honey, I need more time.

54:31.469 --> 54:34.204
She's in a really
fragile place right now.

54:34.238 --> 54:37.207
She knows about us, Bill.
I can sense it.

54:37.241 --> 54:39.209
No, you're
being paranoid.

54:39.243 --> 54:41.979
She's just
really unstable.

54:42.012 --> 54:43.814
She's here. Gotta go.

54:47.652 --> 54:51.188
Donna. I really
appreciate you coming.

54:51.221 --> 54:52.857
Absolutely.
It's my pleasure.

54:52.890 --> 54:54.359
How are you?
I'm good.

54:54.392 --> 54:56.627
I really need
your help with this.

54:56.661 --> 54:59.330
Yeah. I find the whole thing
rather intriguing.

54:59.364 --> 55:01.098
Well,
you're not living it.

55:01.131 --> 55:03.934
By the way,
how is Bill holding up?

55:03.968 --> 55:06.203
He's, um--

55:06.236 --> 55:09.139
Well,
he's a basket case.

55:09.173 --> 55:10.140
Wow.

55:10.174 --> 55:11.742
Any news from the doctor?

55:11.776 --> 55:14.244
Uh,

55:14.278 --> 55:15.913
not good news.

55:15.946 --> 55:20.718
Looks like it's gonna
be just Bill and me.

55:20.751 --> 55:22.720
I'm so sorry.

55:25.723 --> 55:27.558
So we're gonna get
your brother some help.

55:27.592 --> 55:29.026
You understand?
Okay, Pop.

55:29.059 --> 55:30.327
I'll miss him.

55:30.361 --> 55:32.296
Don't want to be late.

55:32.329 --> 55:34.932
Ms. Airlie will
be upset with you, huh?

55:34.965 --> 55:36.166
Yep.

55:36.200 --> 55:37.935
Did you finish that project?

55:37.968 --> 55:39.169
Yep. I finished it.

55:39.203 --> 55:41.271
All right.
Give me a kiss.

55:41.305 --> 55:42.840
Love you.

55:42.873 --> 55:44.375
Have a good day.

55:52.049 --> 55:54.419
What the hell?

55:56.887 --> 55:57.988
Ryan!

56:00.257 --> 56:01.792
Hi, Mr. Anderson.

56:04.028 --> 56:06.497
Eh...

56:06.531 --> 56:08.298
I don't know,
though.

56:08.332 --> 56:11.068
I--I will think
about it carefully.

56:13.270 --> 56:17.074
So, uh,
Christine's case,

56:17.107 --> 56:18.342
please,

56:18.375 --> 56:19.610
tell me
what you think.

56:19.644 --> 56:21.245
I'm just
too close to it.

56:21.278 --> 56:23.280
Well, based on
what you've described,

56:23.313 --> 56:24.682
I'm thinking D.I.D.

56:24.715 --> 56:26.216
Interesting.

56:26.250 --> 56:28.385
A severe trauma can
trigger the splintering

56:28.419 --> 56:29.954
of a single personality
into two distinct

56:29.987 --> 56:31.055
personalities.

56:31.088 --> 56:33.558
You know, often
the second one is created

56:33.591 --> 56:36.561
'cause the original can't
handle the issues at hand,

56:36.594 --> 56:39.664
but it operates
as its own entity,

56:39.697 --> 56:41.666
you know,
with its own agenda.

56:41.699 --> 56:43.668
Well, then explain
the hallucinations.

56:43.701 --> 56:46.336
Cognitive leakage.
I mean, any event

56:46.370 --> 56:48.473
that threatens to expose
the original mind

56:48.506 --> 56:50.708
to the alternate mind
must be blocked,

56:50.741 --> 56:53.143
o the hallucinations
re kind of like...

56:53.177 --> 56:55.746
psychological
rationalizations.

56:55.780 --> 56:57.047
Hmm.

56:58.115 --> 56:59.817
I have
to think about it.

56:59.850 --> 57:01.852
You should trust me
on this one.

57:01.886 --> 57:05.122
You know, it was
less than 100 years ago

57:05.155 --> 57:06.924
that people thought
the mentally ill

57:06.957 --> 57:11.328
were all possessed
by spirits of the dead.

57:11.361 --> 57:14.098
I have got to get
back to the office.

57:14.131 --> 57:15.165
Okay.

57:18.335 --> 57:20.104
Great to see you.
Thank you.

57:20.137 --> 57:21.038
Yeah.

57:24.875 --> 57:26.176
Bye.

57:37.988 --> 57:39.524
John!

57:40.858 --> 57:42.026
John!

57:43.894 --> 57:45.963
John!

57:45.996 --> 57:47.898
Help, please!

57:48.999 --> 57:50.801
Help!

57:50.835 --> 57:53.470
Next we'll discuss
the supernatural symbolism

57:53.504 --> 57:55.372
Shakespeare uses
in "Macbeth."

57:55.405 --> 57:57.508
For example,
the witches represent

57:57.542 --> 57:58.943
Macbeth's inner evil.

57:58.976 --> 58:01.278
The brooding darkness
symbolizes the darkness

58:01.311 --> 58:02.279
in Macbeth's heart

58:02.312 --> 58:03.581
and the evil nature

58:03.614 --> 58:06.050
of his horrible deeds.

58:06.083 --> 58:08.085
Uh, go ahead, Ryan.

58:59.403 --> 59:01.138
What the hell?

59:23.828 --> 59:25.596
Susan?

59:54.091 --> 59:55.092
Demon!

01:00:04.902 --> 01:00:05.870
Susan.

01:00:08.773 --> 01:00:13.110
There's--There's evil
in the house.

01:00:13.143 --> 01:00:14.979
Are you sick?

01:00:17.581 --> 01:00:19.216
Did you take these?

01:00:20.651 --> 01:00:23.420
There's a demon
in the house.

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:25.289
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:25.322 --> 01:00:27.057
How many of these
did you take?

01:00:27.091 --> 01:00:29.694
Shh. Shh.

01:00:29.727 --> 01:00:31.361
All right, come on,
let's get you out of this--

01:00:31.395 --> 01:00:33.197
No! No! No!

01:00:36.533 --> 01:00:39.236
There's evil
in this house.

01:00:39.269 --> 01:00:41.471
I saw it
with my own eyes.

01:00:41.505 --> 01:00:44.441
She drove
the big red truck.

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:45.910
What truck?

01:00:45.943 --> 01:00:47.477
John Anderson,
she mowed him down.

01:00:47.511 --> 01:00:48.578
She killed him.
I saw it with

01:00:48.612 --> 01:00:49.646
my own eyes.

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:50.848
John Anderson's
dead because of her.

01:00:50.881 --> 01:00:52.582
What are you talking about?

01:00:52.616 --> 01:00:53.884
All right, come on.

01:00:53.918 --> 01:00:55.619
No, she's possessed!

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:58.022
She's possessed!

01:00:59.423 --> 01:01:01.491
She's possessed,
honey.

01:01:01.525 --> 01:01:04.695
She's possessed!

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:12.770
Hey, do you know
where your, uh, dad's at?

01:01:14.705 --> 01:01:16.073
He was
in an accident

01:01:16.106 --> 01:01:16.707
yesterday.

01:01:16.741 --> 01:01:18.709
Is he all right?

01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:21.411
He's dead.

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:23.714
Oh, my God.

01:01:23.748 --> 01:01:25.249
What are you
talking about, he's dead?

01:01:25.282 --> 01:01:26.350
Hit-and-run.

01:01:27.952 --> 01:01:29.053
Where?

01:01:29.086 --> 01:01:30.888
Oh, for God's sake!
Does it matter where?

01:01:34.491 --> 01:01:37.795
I'm really sorry
about your dad.

01:01:38.796 --> 01:01:40.530
I'm Christine,
by the way,

01:01:40.564 --> 01:01:41.531
his fiancée.

01:01:41.565 --> 01:01:43.667
Yeah. My dad
was all excited

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.402
about you guys
getting married.

01:01:45.435 --> 01:01:47.872
He wanted me
to give you this.

01:01:49.339 --> 01:01:51.041
Thank you.

01:01:51.075 --> 01:01:53.443
I'm really sorry
for your loss.

01:01:53.477 --> 01:01:55.980
Let's go.

01:01:56.013 --> 01:01:56.947
Take care.

01:02:01.218 --> 01:02:03.520
"James, congratulations
to you and Christine.

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:05.155
"I know we're
both a little

01:02:05.189 --> 01:02:06.290
strapped for cash

01:02:06.323 --> 01:02:07.391
"until
business improves,

01:02:07.424 --> 01:02:08.392
so I'd be honored

01:02:08.425 --> 01:02:10.427
"if you would accept
my cabin as your

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:11.461
honeymoon getaway

01:02:11.495 --> 01:02:13.430
"and my wedding present
to you.

01:02:13.463 --> 01:02:15.032
Best wishes, John."

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:05.015
You've been
fucking amazing.

01:03:07.751 --> 01:03:10.520
Pretty soon,
we'll be together.

01:03:10.554 --> 01:03:12.056
Can't wait.

01:03:13.958 --> 01:03:17.094
So tell me
about our fall guy.

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:20.364
I'll take care of Dave
Saturday night.

01:03:20.397 --> 01:03:21.498
Mm.

01:03:21.531 --> 01:03:23.067
What's his motive?

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:25.302
Uh...

01:03:25.335 --> 01:03:26.937
obsession.

01:03:26.971 --> 01:03:29.439
Couldn't deal with your
marriage to James.

01:03:31.308 --> 01:03:33.443
Perfect.

01:04:03.473 --> 01:04:04.441
Congratulations.

01:04:04.474 --> 01:04:07.277
Thank you so much.

01:04:07.311 --> 01:04:09.646
Hey, it's a shame Susan
couldn't make it.

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:11.181
Is everything okay?

01:04:11.215 --> 01:04:13.117
Yeah, I guess
she came down

01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:15.019
with stomach flu
or something.

01:04:15.052 --> 01:04:17.054
Take good care
of Christine,

01:04:17.087 --> 01:04:20.024
'cause if anything happens to
her, I'll kill you,

01:04:20.057 --> 01:04:22.960
and I'll make it
look like an accident.

01:04:22.993 --> 01:04:25.462
You guys have fun
at the cabin!

01:04:25.495 --> 01:04:28.665
Give me a call when you come
up for air, huh?

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:30.400
I will.

01:04:30.434 --> 01:04:32.236
Bye, big brother.

01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:34.104
Bye.

01:05:17.047 --> 01:05:19.249
So that's over with.

01:05:19.283 --> 01:05:20.750
Mm.
Got mixed emotions,

01:05:20.784 --> 01:05:22.186
but she seems
to be happy,

01:05:22.219 --> 01:05:24.288
nd I guess that's all
hat matters, right?

01:05:24.321 --> 01:05:26.957
Everyone was disappointed that
you weren't there.

01:05:26.991 --> 01:05:30.094
Well, your sister is
a very sick girl, Bill.

01:05:30.127 --> 01:05:31.895
Oh, God,
please just don't.

01:05:31.928 --> 01:05:33.297
Just don't.

01:05:34.564 --> 01:05:36.466
Donna was right.

01:05:37.534 --> 01:05:39.036
You talked to Donna?

01:05:39.069 --> 01:05:43.040
She's developed two very
distinct personalities.

01:05:44.208 --> 01:05:47.111
You know, it's interesting.
Two sides...

01:05:47.144 --> 01:05:50.580
Chrissy and Christine.

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:55.885
Now, Chrissy
is the evil one...

01:05:55.919 --> 01:06:00.857
and she absorbs
all of Christine's pain

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:03.527
nd settles all
f her grudges for her.

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:05.295
That's ridiculous.

01:06:05.329 --> 01:06:06.363
You know what?

01:06:06.396 --> 01:06:09.066
I still don't understand
why in the world

01:06:09.099 --> 01:06:11.868
she would ever
kill John Anderson.

01:06:11.901 --> 01:06:15.139
Susie, you really gotta
stop taking those pills.

01:06:15.172 --> 01:06:17.507
I know what I saw, Bill,

01:06:17.541 --> 01:06:20.177
and Monday morning,

01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:21.978
I'm going to the police,

01:06:22.012 --> 01:06:24.848
and I'm going
to tell them everything.

01:06:24.881 --> 01:06:26.850
Yeah, you do that.

01:06:26.883 --> 01:06:29.386
You're just gonna
make a goddamn ass

01:06:29.419 --> 01:06:30.354
of yourself.

01:06:46.036 --> 01:06:50.607
* Try to look me in the eyes

01:06:54.411 --> 01:06:57.781
* And see if you can recognize

01:06:59.316 --> 01:07:04.421
* The girl you thought
I should have been

01:07:07.791 --> 01:07:11.061
* And all your wishes
in between

01:07:16.566 --> 01:07:20.104
* Feels kinda strange

01:07:23.807 --> 01:07:29.779
* Set me free

01:07:29.813 --> 01:07:33.317
* You got what you want

01:07:36.986 --> 01:07:43.860
* Set me free

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:48.365
* Yeah...

01:07:51.034 --> 01:07:53.637
We did it.

01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:55.239
Yeah, we did.

01:07:56.273 --> 01:07:58.608
Can you believe it?

01:07:58.642 --> 01:08:00.577
Nope.

01:08:03.147 --> 01:08:05.081
Why are you so sad?

01:08:06.616 --> 01:08:08.185
It's nothing.

01:08:11.788 --> 01:08:14.591
Why are you crying?

01:08:16.126 --> 01:08:18.261
Just love you so much.

01:08:28.705 --> 01:08:30.439
Hey, wait.

01:08:30.474 --> 01:08:31.575
What?

01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:34.743
I have a surprise
for you in my car.

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:37.546
Go get it?

01:08:37.581 --> 01:08:38.982
What is it?

01:08:39.015 --> 01:08:41.251
It's a surprise.
I can't tell you.

01:08:41.285 --> 01:08:42.719
It's in my trunk.

01:08:45.689 --> 01:08:46.923
Okay.

01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:48.192
Go.

01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:53.095
I love you.

01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:54.764
I love you.

01:09:30.367 --> 01:09:33.169
BILL:
It's the blushing bride.

01:09:33.203 --> 01:09:35.372
Hey, big brother.

01:09:35.404 --> 01:09:37.807
Could I ask you
a favor?

01:09:37.841 --> 01:09:39.175
Yeah. What's up?

01:09:40.544 --> 01:09:43.613
If you can't,
I understand. I just--

01:09:43.647 --> 01:09:46.283
Is there any way you
could come scope out

01:09:46.316 --> 01:09:47.751
the cabin tonight?

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:48.917
Tonight?

01:09:48.952 --> 01:09:51.688
Yeah. Is that
too much to ask?

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.689
Is everything okay?

01:09:53.723 --> 01:09:55.459
I think so.

01:09:55.492 --> 01:09:57.761
Maybe I'm
just paranoid. I...

01:09:57.794 --> 01:09:59.963
just feel like
someone's following us,

01:09:59.996 --> 01:10:02.566
and I don't want
to bother James.

01:10:02.599 --> 01:10:05.302
Give me 30 minutes
to get up there.

01:10:05.335 --> 01:10:07.771
Thanks.
I owe you big time.

01:10:29.759 --> 01:10:31.328
Motherf...

01:11:22.479 --> 01:11:24.448
James.

01:11:28.885 --> 01:11:30.654
What?
James.

01:11:34.858 --> 01:11:37.494
Zeal, scram.

01:11:41.197 --> 01:11:42.966
You little bitch.

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:46.436
It was you the whole time,
wasn 't it?

01:11:48.505 --> 01:11:50.273
You don't even
have the balls to pull

01:11:50.306 --> 01:11:51.307
that trigger, Ryan.

01:11:51.341 --> 01:11:54.344
You know that.
What do you think, Ryan?

01:11:54.378 --> 01:11:56.346
Think if you kill me,
she's gonna want you, huh?

01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:58.948
hink that's
hat it's about?

01:12:00.517 --> 01:12:02.886
You're nothing
but a little freak.

01:12:06.723 --> 01:12:07.757
Christine?

01:12:10.894 --> 01:12:14.063
It's a terrifying
feeling, isn't it?

01:12:14.097 --> 01:12:16.566
Lying helpless,
waiting to die?

01:12:17.501 --> 01:12:20.470
It's how they felt,
James.

01:12:20.504 --> 01:12:24.107
What are you
talking about, baby?

01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:27.343
My parents, James.

01:12:29.446 --> 01:12:31.515
Baby, have you
gone crazy?

01:12:34.818 --> 01:12:36.686
Maybe.

01:12:43.593 --> 01:12:47.363
Ah, look at our
sleeping beauty

01:12:47.397 --> 01:12:48.598
up there.

01:12:48.632 --> 01:12:50.133
ELLEN: James,
be careful, please.

01:12:50.166 --> 01:12:51.300
DOUG:
Will you relax?

01:12:51.334 --> 01:12:53.437
When it rains this hard,

01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:56.940
it usually only lasts
a few minutes.

01:13:02.078 --> 01:13:05.549
How you doing
up there, buddy?

01:13:05.582 --> 01:13:08.151
Uh, the highway's flooded.
I gotta take this exit.

01:13:10.587 --> 01:13:13.256
y the way, I'm sick
f your comments

01:13:13.289 --> 01:13:15.224
about my lack
of education in front

01:13:15.258 --> 01:13:16.426
of our daughter.

01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:23.099
I don't like your tone.
My tone?

01:13:23.132 --> 01:13:24.801
Yes,
your condescending tone.

01:13:24.834 --> 01:13:25.935
You started it.

01:13:32.476 --> 01:13:34.478
You sound like a child.

01:13:34.511 --> 01:13:36.680
Stop treating me
like a child.

01:13:36.713 --> 01:13:38.548
What's going on, buddy?

01:13:38.582 --> 01:13:42.185
Well, the car stalled.

01:13:42.218 --> 01:13:43.753
What?

01:13:53.697 --> 01:13:55.665
DOUG: Well, there you go.
ELLEN: Oh, thank God.

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:02.506
Hey, watch out!
You're in reverse!

01:14:02.539 --> 01:14:03.473
There's a train!

01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:05.374
James,
what are you doing?!

01:14:05.408 --> 01:14:07.076
James, there's a train!

01:14:09.112 --> 01:14:10.446
James!
Sorry!

01:14:11.948 --> 01:14:12.916
James!

01:14:21.591 --> 01:14:22.892
God. Oh, my God.

01:14:22.926 --> 01:14:25.028
Oh, no! No!

01:14:25.061 --> 01:14:26.696
No!

01:14:35.438 --> 01:14:36.540
Just take
responsibility

01:14:36.573 --> 01:14:38.107
for what you did,
James.

01:14:38.141 --> 01:14:41.077
Christine,
I did it for you.

01:14:42.211 --> 01:14:43.747
For us.

01:14:44.948 --> 01:14:47.817
They were never gonna
let us be together.

01:14:47.851 --> 01:14:48.785
You know that.

01:14:50.386 --> 01:14:53.356
And I thought it
was gonna make it easier.

01:14:53.389 --> 01:14:54.490
I really did.

01:14:55.992 --> 01:14:57.894
But I was wrong.

01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:05.669
I wish
I could take it back.

01:15:10.473 --> 01:15:12.542
I'm sorry.

01:15:13.877 --> 01:15:16.279
Give me the gun.

01:15:17.446 --> 01:15:20.416
No, Christine, please.

01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:22.819
You know, it didn't
have to be this way.

01:15:24.453 --> 01:15:26.422
This is your fault,
James!

01:15:26.455 --> 01:15:27.624
Christine, no, please!

01:15:27.657 --> 01:15:31.728
No, I loved you.
I loved you.

01:15:32.729 --> 01:15:34.598
How could you do this?
This is unreal.

01:15:50.714 --> 01:15:52.348
That wasn't the plan.

01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:54.584
Your prints
are all over the gun.

01:15:54.618 --> 01:15:56.886
Just shut up, Ryan!

01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:58.788
Ah, fuck.

01:16:02.158 --> 01:16:04.327
Okay. Okay.

01:16:09.432 --> 01:16:11.735
Holy shit, Ryan!
Is that a cop?

01:16:11.768 --> 01:16:13.502
Oh, shit. They must
have heard the shot.

01:16:13.536 --> 01:16:14.638
Get him in the car.

01:17:33.783 --> 01:17:35.351
Oh, shit. Now what?

01:17:35.384 --> 01:17:36.652
Now what?

01:17:36.686 --> 01:17:37.921
Th-They're gonna
call his radio.

01:17:37.954 --> 01:17:39.022
There's gonna
be no response.

01:17:39.055 --> 01:17:40.690
Then they come
looking for him.

01:17:40.724 --> 01:17:42.425
Listen to me. Just calm down,
all right?

01:17:42.458 --> 01:17:43.626
f we get--
ust calm down.

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:45.128
It's gonna be, okay.
Just trust me.

01:17:45.161 --> 01:17:46.429
Trust me,
Ryan, okay?

01:17:46.462 --> 01:17:48.331
Just get rid
of the girl,

01:17:48.364 --> 01:17:50.066
and wipe down
the gun.

01:17:50.099 --> 01:17:51.100
Okay, trust me.

01:17:54.237 --> 01:17:55.772
Shit.

01:18:20.864 --> 01:18:21.630
Hey.

01:18:21.664 --> 01:18:24.133
Bill.
Bill, he's here.

01:18:24.167 --> 01:18:25.034
What?

01:18:25.068 --> 01:18:26.535
He's--He's
in the house.

01:18:26.569 --> 01:18:27.771
You have
to hurry.

01:18:27.804 --> 01:18:29.238
He's gonna
kill me.

01:18:29.272 --> 01:18:30.506
Stay on the phone
with me.

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:31.775
Tell me exactly
what's going on.

01:18:31.808 --> 01:18:32.942
I'm almost there!

01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:35.578
He shot James.

01:18:35.611 --> 01:18:37.213
James is dead.

01:18:37.246 --> 01:18:38.381
Who shot him?

01:18:38.414 --> 01:18:39.382
Ryan.

01:18:39.415 --> 01:18:40.383
Ryan Anderson.

01:18:40.416 --> 01:18:41.384
Bill,
please hurry.

01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:42.651
He's gonna
find me.

01:18:42.685 --> 01:18:44.087
Where is he?
Are you in the house?

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:46.422
Yes, I'm locked in the bedroom.
Hurry.

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:48.157
Okay,
I'm five minutes away.

01:18:48.191 --> 01:18:50.026
Just don't--

01:18:50.059 --> 01:18:51.928
Chr-Chri--

01:18:58.467 --> 01:18:59.635
131.

01:18:59.668 --> 01:19:00.636
131.

01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:02.038
DISPATCHER:
Go ahead, 131.

01:19:02.071 --> 01:19:03.639
Code three,
1822 Roaming Wood Road,

01:19:03.672 --> 01:19:04.473
Cottage Grove.

01:19:04.507 --> 01:19:06.275
Send every car
in the area.

01:19:06.309 --> 01:19:07.610
Roger, 131. En route.

01:20:01.297 --> 01:20:04.133
I gotta get Dave's car
back to town.

01:20:04.167 --> 01:20:06.135
Wow.

01:20:09.605 --> 01:20:13.076
How are you
gonna get rid of him?

01:20:13.109 --> 01:20:15.111
Oh, I--

01:20:15.144 --> 01:20:18.447
I'll do him
with the shotgun,

01:20:18.481 --> 01:20:20.583
and I'll, uh--

01:20:20.616 --> 01:20:22.551
I'll dump a bunch
of your stuff

01:20:22.585 --> 01:20:23.853
around his trailer,

01:20:23.887 --> 01:20:27.290
make him look like
the classic stalker.

01:20:29.192 --> 01:20:32.028
There's tire tracks
all over this place.

01:20:34.864 --> 01:20:36.232
CHRISTINE:
And what about

01:20:36.265 --> 01:20:37.366
our other loose end?

01:20:39.068 --> 01:20:41.037
RYAN: Don't worry
about a thing.

01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:43.539
She's--
She's taken care of.

01:20:46.342 --> 01:20:47.310
Perfect.

01:20:47.343 --> 01:20:48.477
Yeah.

01:20:48.511 --> 01:20:51.280
Take this off.

01:20:51.314 --> 01:20:54.050
* Leave you

01:20:54.083 --> 01:20:56.585
* There's no reason to be

01:20:58.221 --> 01:21:01.424
* There's no reason to be

01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:05.261
* Frightened

01:21:05.294 --> 01:21:07.964
* Darling, of me

01:21:12.835 --> 01:21:14.570
Come here.

01:21:43.599 --> 01:21:45.468
Choke me.

01:21:45.501 --> 01:21:46.602
What?

01:21:46.635 --> 01:21:48.571
Don't stop.
Choke me.

01:21:48.604 --> 01:21:49.805
You're k-kidding.

01:22:04.287 --> 01:22:08.857
No!

01:22:10.459 --> 01:22:12.028
Hey!

01:22:12.061 --> 01:22:13.662
You're a fucking dead man! No!

01:22:19.135 --> 01:22:21.604
* There's no reason to be

01:22:23.139 --> 01:22:26.209
* There's no reason to be

01:22:27.410 --> 01:22:28.777
Listen to me.

01:22:28.811 --> 01:22:31.814
I need you to tell me
what's going on.

01:22:31.847 --> 01:22:35.018
Susan says that
you've killed someone,

01:22:35.051 --> 01:22:37.853
that she can
place you at the scene

01:22:37.886 --> 01:22:39.088
of a homicide.

01:22:39.122 --> 01:22:43.192
Now if you need help,
I can help you,

01:22:43.226 --> 01:22:46.295
but you've gotta
be honest with me.

01:22:46.329 --> 01:22:49.432
he police are gonna
e here any second.

01:22:54.237 --> 01:22:56.739
You're in a lot
of trouble, Bill.

01:23:14.090 --> 01:23:16.192
Miss Webb,
what was the nature

01:23:16.225 --> 01:23:18.694
of your relationship
with the two victims?

01:23:18.727 --> 01:23:19.662
Miss Webb?

01:23:22.831 --> 01:23:25.134
So do you know
this Ryan Anderson?

01:23:26.635 --> 01:23:27.770
What?

01:23:27.803 --> 01:23:30.573
Did you know
Ryan Anderson?

01:23:30.606 --> 01:23:34.210
No. I think he worked
at the sawmill with James.

01:23:35.278 --> 01:23:37.012
We found this
in the front seat

01:23:37.046 --> 01:23:38.347
of one of the cars.

01:23:38.381 --> 01:23:40.249
Do you recognize
this weapon, Mr. Webb?

01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:43.819
Might be mine.

01:23:43.852 --> 01:23:45.954
It might be yours?

01:23:45.988 --> 01:23:48.657
How did it get here?

01:23:48.691 --> 01:23:51.494
I don't know.

01:23:51.527 --> 01:23:53.429
We got
two dead bodies,

01:23:53.462 --> 01:23:55.864
one young man in his
early twenties,

01:23:55.898 --> 01:23:58.834
one in his fifties,
a Sheriff

01:23:58.867 --> 01:24:00.969
both shot
execution style.

01:24:01.003 --> 01:24:02.371
Shotgun wounds?

01:24:02.405 --> 01:24:04.373
Definitely.

01:24:04.407 --> 01:24:07.776
Do you know anything about thes
e
bodies, Mr. Webb?

01:24:09.712 --> 01:24:11.314
I want an attorney.

01:24:17.353 --> 01:24:20.256
CHRISTINE: And what about
our other loose end?

01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:23.426
RYAN: Don't worry
about a thing.

01:24:23.459 --> 01:24:25.761
She's--
She's taken care of.

01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:31.500
BILL: Susan says that
you've killed someone,

01:24:31.534 --> 01:24:33.769
that she can
place you at the scene

01:24:33.802 --> 01:24:34.737
of a homicide.

01:24:36.038 --> 01:24:37.906
ELLEN: We're almost done,
sweetheart.

01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:40.643
Just one more
little thing.

01:24:50.953 --> 01:24:53.289
Hi.
Hi, Mommy.

01:24:53.322 --> 01:24:55.491
Thank you,
Mr. Blooms!

01:24:55.524 --> 01:24:56.592
Take care, Susan.

01:24:56.625 --> 01:24:58.261
Thank you.
Bye.

01:24:58.294 --> 01:25:02.831
Oh! Oh, I missed
you so much!

01:25:02.865 --> 01:25:04.467
o what did
ou learn today?

01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:07.636
I learned how to play
"Mary Had A Little Lamb."

01:25:07.670 --> 01:25:08.771
No way.
Yes.

01:25:08.804 --> 01:25:10.173
'Cause you are
my little lamb.

01:25:10.206 --> 01:25:11.674
You can't catch me!
Yes, you are!

01:25:11.707 --> 01:25:13.609
Yes, you're
my little...

01:25:29.225 --> 01:25:34.163
* We are just chemicals

01:25:35.898 --> 01:25:41.304
* In creative orbitals

01:25:42.438 --> 01:25:47.376
* And we're all
just breaking bonds

01:25:48.877 --> 01:25:52.581
* To form new ones

01:25:52.615 --> 01:25:57.720
* Whoa, oh, oh oh

01:25:57.753 --> 01:26:02.024
* So cut me

01:26:02.057 --> 01:26:04.760
* Whoa, oh

01:26:04.793 --> 01:26:08.797
* So cut me

01:26:08.831 --> 01:26:13.502
* Loose

01:26:14.737 --> 01:26:21.744
* Loose

01:26:21.777 --> 01:26:26.415
* Loose

01:26:28.451 --> 01:26:38.727
* Loose

01:26:41.230 --> 01:26:45.734
* We are just chemicals

01:26:47.536 --> 01:26:52.975
* And I'd love
to study yours

01:26:54.343 --> 01:26:58.781
* Use all my energy

01:27:00.449 --> 01:27:04.253
* To break you free

01:27:04.287 --> 01:27:09.958
* Whoa oh

01:27:09.992 --> 01:27:14.062
* So cut me

01:27:14.096 --> 01:27:16.632
* Whoa oh

01:27:16.665 --> 01:27:20.736
* So cut me

01:27:20.769 --> 01:27:25.240
* Loose

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:33.716
* Loose

01:27:33.749 --> 01:27:38.354
* Loose

01:27:40.088 --> 01:27:57.573
* Loose

01:28:25.634 --> 01:28:30.439
* I ran away from the lights

01:28:32.107 --> 01:28:37.413
* Of desire, it can last

01:28:38.447 --> 01:28:43.318
* And your negativity

01:28:44.987 --> 01:28:48.791
* It attracts me

01:28:48.824 --> 01:28:54.329
* Whoa

01:28:54.363 --> 01:28:58.601
* So cut me

01:28:58.634 --> 01:29:00.836
* Whoa oh

01:29:00.869 --> 01:29:05.073
* So cut me

01:29:05.107 --> 01:29:09.745
* Loose

01:29:11.647 --> 01:29:18.220
* Loose

01:29:18.253 --> 01:29:22.691
* Loose

01:29:24.693 --> 01:29:40.075
* Loose

01:29:58.561 --> 01:30:01.697
* There we were
dancing in the dark

01:30:01.730 --> 01:30:06.334
* With your hands
wrapped around my heart

01:30:06.368 --> 01:30:07.335
* Heart

01:30:07.369 --> 01:30:10.238
* Heart

01:30:10.272 --> 01:30:13.008
* We were kids
seamlessly in love

01:30:13.041 --> 01:30:17.412
* But in the teens,
when love's still enough

01:30:17.446 --> 01:30:18.447
* Enough

01:30:18.481 --> 01:30:20.916
* Enough

01:30:20.949 --> 01:30:24.487
* Well, take me back
to when you said goodbye

01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:27.089
* So that I can
change your mind

01:30:27.122 --> 01:30:29.391
* Darling, don't go

01:30:29.424 --> 01:30:31.760
* Don't leave me alone

01:30:31.794 --> 01:30:35.297
* Come on,
and say we're together

01:30:35.330 --> 01:30:38.467
* Say we're together

01:30:38.501 --> 01:30:40.703
* It's a mistake

01:30:40.736 --> 01:30:43.371
* Don't leave me this way

01:30:43.405 --> 01:30:46.975
* Come on,
and stay here forever

01:30:47.009 --> 01:30:50.813
* Stay here forever

01:30:52.981 --> 01:30:55.951
* Sneaking out
to meet you in the street

01:30:55.984 --> 01:31:00.956
* Running fast
against the summer heat

01:31:00.989 --> 01:31:04.159
* Heat

01:31:04.192 --> 01:31:07.195
* I never thought
that those days would ever end

01:31:07.229 --> 01:31:12.501
* But here we are, and you
want to be just friends

01:31:12.535 --> 01:31:15.604
* Friends

01:31:15.638 --> 01:31:16.839
* Well, take me back...

01:31:16.872 --> 01:31:19.307
By the pricking
of my thumbs,

01:31:19.341 --> 01:31:22.845
something wicked
this way comes.
