00:04.767 --> 00:05.594
Hey, Calvin.

00:06.320 --> 00:07.364
What are you looking for?

00:07.612 --> 00:08.745
The newspaper.

00:09.036 --> 00:11.080
That new paperboy hasn't
hit my porch once

00:11.105 --> 00:12.177
since he started.

00:12.202 --> 00:13.830
The closest he got was my truck.

00:13.855 --> 00:15.706
And I was driving down
the street at the time.

00:16.842 --> 00:17.667
That's funny.

00:17.692 --> 00:19.214
I found one right on my
doorstep this morning,

00:19.239 --> 00:20.963
and I don't even get the paper.

00:22.060 --> 00:24.269
Give me a dollar or
give me my paper, Dave.

00:24.943 --> 00:26.386
Okay, but spoiler alert:

00:26.411 --> 00:28.065
I read your horoscope,
and today's gonna be

00:28.090 --> 00:29.671
a good day for romance.

00:30.184 --> 00:32.087
It already was.

00:32.112 --> 00:34.706
Tina woke me up early this morning.

00:36.542 --> 00:37.962
Hey, Calvin.

00:37.987 --> 00:39.932
Hey, Gemma, what are you doing home?

00:39.957 --> 00:41.776
I had to come back to change.

00:41.801 --> 00:43.681
My PE teacher didn't show up again,

00:43.706 --> 00:45.643
so I had to cover dodgeball for him.

00:45.712 --> 00:46.924
Oh, that's a relief.

00:46.949 --> 00:49.511
I thought you had got
jumped into a gang.

00:49.930 --> 00:51.409
I don't know what I've got to do

00:51.434 --> 00:53.298
to get through to Coach McCluskey.

00:53.323 --> 00:54.417
I keep warning him,

00:54.442 --> 00:56.328
but he's always got some excuse.

00:56.353 --> 00:59.546
His mother died twice, and
then she was in a coma.

01:01.116 --> 01:04.363
You know, if it were me, I
would just sit him down,

01:04.388 --> 01:06.738
I would put my hand on his shoulder,

01:06.906 --> 01:08.504
and I would gently say...

01:08.909 --> 01:10.796
"Your ass if fired."

01:12.789 --> 01:14.362
But that's so extreme.

01:14.387 --> 01:15.940
I just keep hoping I
can figure out a way

01:15.965 --> 01:17.808
to get him to shape up.

01:18.199 --> 01:20.362
Yeah. I keep hoping N.W.A
will get back together,

01:20.387 --> 01:23.296
but Dr. Dre just keeps
selling headphones.

01:25.074 --> 01:26.556
Calvin, found your paper.

01:26.581 --> 01:28.421
You didn't read it in
the bathroom, did you?

01:28.489 --> 01:30.630
I'm gonna go get you a dollar.

01:33.847 --> 01:37.010

01:38.974 --> 01:40.498
Do you think Calvin's right?

01:40.523 --> 01:42.442
Should I fire Coach McCluskey?

01:42.467 --> 01:44.776
Ooh, hold on. Uh, is this
one of those situations

01:44.801 --> 01:46.374
where you really want
to hear what I think,

01:46.399 --> 01:47.935
or you just want me to support you?

01:47.960 --> 01:50.180
I absolutely want to
hear what you think.

01:50.205 --> 01:51.598
Okay, well, then...

01:51.675 --> 01:53.364
I definitely think you should fire him.

01:53.389 --> 01:55.383
But he's been there for years!

01:55.408 --> 01:57.874
But not before you give him
at least one more chance.

01:59.805 --> 02:02.552
- And make me look like a weak leader?
- No.

02:03.020 --> 02:04.544
I mean, yes. I mean...

02:04.841 --> 02:06.498
I mean, your hair looks great.

02:07.465 --> 02:09.330
Dave, I'm serious.

02:09.356 --> 02:11.663
This has been weighing on me all day.

02:11.734 --> 02:13.708
All right, look, I wish
that I could help you,

02:13.733 --> 02:16.432
but this is a decision
that only you can make.

02:16.457 --> 02:18.419
And whatever it is, I know it's gonna

02:18.444 --> 02:19.540
be the right one.

02:20.333 --> 02:21.513
You're right.

02:21.735 --> 02:23.607
I'm the boss. It's my decision.

02:23.642 --> 02:25.164
McCluskey has to go.

02:25.957 --> 02:27.873
There. I feel better already.

02:28.746 --> 02:30.582
Are you talking about Coach McCluskey?

02:31.505 --> 02:33.123
He's the best.

02:33.829 --> 02:35.543
Really? You think so?

02:35.682 --> 02:39.540
Yeah. He takes naps and
lets us watch movies.

02:39.957 --> 02:41.873
One of them even showed a butt.

02:44.456 --> 02:46.748
On the other hand, this
guy sounds pretty cool.

02:51.120 --> 02:52.410
Pop, are you gonna stand there all day

02:52.435 --> 02:53.697
waiting on the paperboy?

02:53.722 --> 02:55.140
If that's what it takes.

02:55.165 --> 02:56.993
I'm not moving a damn
inch till I give this kid

02:57.018 --> 02:58.372
a piece of my mind.

02:58.586 --> 02:59.942
Who wants pancakes?

02:59.967 --> 03:01.165
Oh, I could eat.

03:03.262 --> 03:05.248
Well, I'll take some pancakes, too.

03:05.273 --> 03:07.415
Oh, and I'll take two
years of back rent.

03:08.570 --> 03:10.137
I'm... You're on lookout duty.

03:10.162 --> 03:12.137
Yeah.

03:13.040 --> 03:14.651
- Oh, hey, Gemma.
- Hey.

03:14.684 --> 03:16.555
Oh, hey. It's 7:30 in the morning.

03:16.580 --> 03:17.830
Is everything okay?

03:17.855 --> 03:18.802
Everything's fine.

03:18.827 --> 03:20.488
I just decided Calvin was right.

03:20.513 --> 03:22.153
I'm gonna fire McCluskey today.

03:22.256 --> 03:23.989
Ah, good for you.

03:24.014 --> 03:26.856
You should've fired that fool the
second time his mother died.

03:28.214 --> 03:29.527
Right, Calvin?

03:29.603 --> 03:30.934
I'm sorry, I didn't hear anything

03:30.959 --> 03:32.790
after "Calvin was right."

03:35.533 --> 03:37.911
It's just, I've never fired
anyone before, and I was hoping

03:37.936 --> 03:39.302
maybe you could give me some advice.

03:39.327 --> 03:40.551
Oh, you came to the right place.

03:40.576 --> 03:42.498
Calvin loves firing people.

03:42.523 --> 03:44.547
Yep, it's true. Pops once fired a dude

03:44.572 --> 03:46.123
on the guy's wedding day.

03:46.758 --> 03:48.123
And I was his best man.

03:50.697 --> 03:52.304
So what's the best way to do it?

03:52.329 --> 03:54.771
What you got to do is stay calm,

03:54.796 --> 03:57.289
confident and professional.

03:57.450 --> 03:59.539
The last thing you want
to do is go personal.

04:00.088 --> 04:01.974
Wrong.

04:02.982 --> 04:06.177
Look, this dude has been
messing with your life, right?

04:06.367 --> 04:07.790
Making you look bad.

04:07.815 --> 04:09.426
You want to rip his throat out.

04:09.545 --> 04:11.460
And you want to do it
in front of people.

04:11.485 --> 04:12.637
For example,

04:12.662 --> 04:14.123
his wedding party.

04:15.307 --> 04:16.915
- Calvin!
- What?

04:17.038 --> 04:18.789
Look, it sends a message.

04:18.814 --> 04:20.380
And if it goes sideways,

04:20.404 --> 04:22.289
knock the cake over for a diversion.

04:23.875 --> 04:25.915
Gemma, things are not gonna go sideways.

04:26.357 --> 04:28.331
Oh, it went sideways back in the day,

04:28.356 --> 04:29.957
when you got fired from Pizza Hut.

04:31.397 --> 04:32.749
That was different.

04:32.774 --> 04:34.653
If Todd didn't want his finger broken,

04:34.678 --> 04:37.417
he shouldn't have been
pointing it in my face!

04:39.186 --> 04:41.164
You getting all this
great advice, Gemma?

04:41.690 --> 04:42.856
I think so.

04:43.079 --> 04:45.177
Rip his throat out, knock over a cake,

04:45.202 --> 04:47.247
and don't point my finger in his face.

04:47.659 --> 04:49.346
Sounds like you're good to go.

04:52.921 --> 04:54.165
Hey, morning, Dad.

04:54.569 --> 04:56.082
What are you doing here, Marty?

04:56.107 --> 04:57.231
Do I need a reason?

04:57.256 --> 04:59.515
Okay, can't a son just stop by

04:59.540 --> 05:00.559
and show some love to the two people

05:00.584 --> 05:02.194
that gave him life?

05:02.901 --> 05:04.706
Your mama made your lunch again.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.748
It's turkey melt Tuesday.

05:07.162 --> 05:09.664
I came out second, but
I'm first in her heart.

05:10.954 --> 05:12.565
Oh, here he comes, right here.

05:12.590 --> 05:14.330
Uh, here who comes?

05:14.355 --> 05:15.790
That sorry-ass paperboy.

05:16.382 --> 05:19.036
I'm about to make him
cry harder than you did

05:19.061 --> 05:21.280
when Malcolm told you you
were adopted.

05:22.998 --> 05:24.706
That wasn't Malcolm, Dad. That was you.

05:25.497 --> 05:27.706
That does sound
like me, doesn't it?

05:29.179 --> 05:31.455
Hold... Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, slow down.

05:31.660 --> 05:33.302
Hey, turn that bike
around and get back here.

05:33.327 --> 05:34.914
I need to talk to you right now.

05:35.082 --> 05:37.415
Marty, I want you to
film this for YouTube.

05:37.910 --> 05:41.040
I want to show the world it's
still okay to yell at kids.

05:41.954 --> 05:43.591
All right, take that
helmet off, young man,

05:43.616 --> 05:44.840
while I talk to you.

05:44.865 --> 05:46.998
See, that's the problem...
Y'all have no re...

05:48.228 --> 05:49.457
spect.

05:49.482 --> 05:51.268
Sorry, sir. What were you saying?

05:51.293 --> 05:53.208
Oh!

05:53.233 --> 05:56.914
I... I was saying... I was saying...

05:57.460 --> 05:59.039
I was... I was saying...

05:59.085 --> 06:01.581
I was saying you are doing a great job.

06:01.932 --> 06:03.540
Yes, you are.

06:03.565 --> 06:05.746
Hey, so, keep up the good work.

06:05.771 --> 06:08.146
Thanks, mister. Got to
go finish my route.

06:08.171 --> 06:09.694
Okay, you do that.

06:09.926 --> 06:11.414
All right, and put your helmet on.

06:11.439 --> 06:15.623
All right, remember, safety first.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.485
And got it.

06:19.826 --> 06:22.536
Erase that right now, boy.
Erase that, now.

06:23.614 --> 06:25.538
Hey, man. I don't have to listen to you.

06:25.563 --> 06:26.998
You're not my father.

06:29.788 --> 06:31.368
You wanted
to see me, Johnson?

06:31.820 --> 06:34.747
Yes, Coach McCluskey.
Please have a seat.

06:37.087 --> 06:39.325
Mmm. You get at some
of this banana bread

06:39.350 --> 06:41.290
from the teachers' lounge?

06:41.315 --> 06:43.709
- Uh, no, I didn't.
- Oh, here.

06:43.757 --> 06:45.890
Finish mine. It's my third piece anyway.

06:48.501 --> 06:50.039
That's very thoughtful of you.

06:51.223 --> 06:52.365
Is there anything else?

06:53.315 --> 06:55.414
Uh, yeah. A lot else.

06:55.439 --> 06:56.580
I've asked you to come in

06:56.605 --> 06:58.345
because we've talked
about you being late,

06:58.370 --> 07:00.205
and I've given you several warnings.

07:00.230 --> 07:02.190
And I've heard each and
every one of them,

07:02.215 --> 07:03.455
which is why I made sure to get back

07:03.480 --> 07:06.123
on the right track. And field.

07:09.943 --> 07:11.300
But have you?

07:11.325 --> 07:13.364
I mean, weren't you late on Friday?

07:13.389 --> 07:14.857
My alarm clock broke.

07:15.472 --> 07:17.248
And then again yesterday?

07:17.273 --> 07:18.290
Dog stuff.

07:19.674 --> 07:20.799
This meeting?

07:20.824 --> 07:22.581
I was getting you the banana bread.

07:25.557 --> 07:28.548
Look, I've given you more
than enough chances.

07:28.787 --> 07:32.573
I'm sorry, but... I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to let you go.

07:32.671 --> 07:35.290
What? You're firing me? Why?

07:38.872 --> 07:41.330
Literally everything I just said.

07:41.556 --> 07:43.658
Does the board of
trustees know about this?

07:44.123 --> 07:46.040
Because I play golf with half of them,

07:46.080 --> 07:47.914
and I always let them win.

07:49.607 --> 07:50.681
Doesn't matter.

07:50.706 --> 07:52.956
This is my decision to
make, and it's final.

07:53.568 --> 07:55.048
Okay. Fine.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.112
But can I say something before I leave?

07:57.342 --> 07:58.549
Go ahead.

07:58.694 --> 08:00.456
You're a terrible principal.

08:01.324 --> 08:02.673
Excuse me?

08:02.698 --> 08:03.955
You heard me.

08:04.021 --> 08:06.373
You're a joke,
and everybody knows it.

08:06.398 --> 08:08.400
The only reason why you got this job

08:08.425 --> 08:10.556
is because it made them look good

08:10.610 --> 08:12.177
to hire a woman.

08:13.705 --> 08:16.291
Oh... and also...

08:16.457 --> 08:17.752
this.

08:25.353 --> 08:26.431
Yeah, well...

08:26.456 --> 08:29.220
joke's on you, 'cause I'm
still gonna eat this!

08:36.938 --> 08:39.080
So?

08:39.124 --> 08:40.081
How'd it go?

08:40.361 --> 08:41.751
Great. I sat him down,

08:41.777 --> 08:43.431
I looked him right in the eye,

08:43.456 --> 08:44.789
and I did what I had to do.

08:45.004 --> 08:47.920
I even celebrated afterwards
with a little banana bread.

08:50.393 --> 08:52.330
I'm so proud of you, and so hoping

08:52.398 --> 08:54.226
that you brought home a little.

08:56.754 --> 08:59.400
Oh, Dave, I feel so terrible.

08:59.752 --> 09:00.907
O-Okay.

09:00.932 --> 09:03.289
Okay. Okay. It's okay.

09:03.314 --> 09:06.252
Look... I wouldn't have
saved any for you, either.

09:15.542 --> 09:17.196
Ooh, hey, Gemma, if you
don't get up soon,

09:17.221 --> 09:18.500
you're gonna be late for work.

09:18.525 --> 09:21.091
I'm not going in today. I'm sick.

09:21.783 --> 09:24.410
Really? Or are you just
pretending to be sick

09:24.435 --> 09:27.524
because you're still upset about
what McCluskey said yesterday?

09:27.867 --> 09:29.315
I'm sick.

09:30.787 --> 09:32.036
See?

09:34.082 --> 09:36.083
Okay.

09:36.108 --> 09:38.316
This is not the way to handle this.

09:39.324 --> 09:41.551
Why not? Grover fakes it.

09:41.699 --> 09:44.024
And so did you when Mission:
Impossible 6came out.

09:44.049 --> 09:47.379
That was a legitimate sick day,
because that movie was sick.

09:50.273 --> 09:51.889
What if McCluskey's right?

09:51.914 --> 09:53.653
What if the only reason they did hire me

09:53.678 --> 09:54.898
is because I'm a woman?

09:55.079 --> 09:56.558
Maybe I'm not tough enough.

09:56.836 --> 09:58.114
Are you kidding?

09:58.184 --> 09:59.837
Gemma, you've gotten test scores up

09:59.862 --> 10:01.950
and increased parent participation.

10:01.975 --> 10:04.787
If the Mission: Impossibleteam
needed a school principal,

10:04.812 --> 10:06.336
they'd choose you.

10:06.589 --> 10:08.648
If you chose to accept it.

10:11.720 --> 10:13.668
I appreciate you trying
to make me feel better,

10:13.693 --> 10:15.731
but I'm worried everyone
thinks I'm a joke.

10:18.060 --> 10:19.845
McCluskey only said that

10:19.870 --> 10:21.314
because you had just fired him.

10:21.506 --> 10:23.732
What'd you think he was
gonna do, give you a hug?

10:24.687 --> 10:28.441
No, but if he needed one, I
would've given it to him.

10:29.184 --> 10:31.022
Okay... this is what we're gonna do.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.596
We're gonna get up, we're
gonna take a shower,

10:32.621 --> 10:33.523
we're gonna get dressed,

10:33.548 --> 10:35.191
and we're gonna show up to that school

10:35.216 --> 10:36.697
with our head held high.

10:36.722 --> 10:38.940
- Ugh, come on.
- Ugh, okay.

10:39.158 --> 10:40.377
There we go.

10:40.402 --> 10:42.596
That's the strong woman I married.

10:44.595 --> 10:46.031
You're not coming out of there, are you?

10:46.056 --> 10:47.275
Nope.

10:52.732 --> 10:55.483
Roast beef on rye. See,
that's a man's lunch.

10:57.727 --> 10:59.275
Wait, no juice box?

11:01.951 --> 11:04.846
Hey, Pop, since when do you
read the news on an iPad?

11:05.228 --> 11:07.799
Since I still can't find my newspaper.

11:08.179 --> 11:09.393
Oh, so what'd you do,

11:09.418 --> 11:10.947
lay into that little
dude so hard yesterday

11:10.972 --> 11:12.670
you scared him off for good?

11:13.013 --> 11:15.733
Yeah, Pop, tell him all
about the big beat-down.

11:18.362 --> 11:21.669
I decided to handle
things a different way.

11:21.694 --> 11:23.173
You know, be the bigger man.

11:24.187 --> 11:25.971
You mean the only man.

11:28.191 --> 11:30.149
You know, I'm starting
to feel a lot less bad

11:30.193 --> 11:32.066
about taking your juice box.

11:34.126 --> 11:35.910
Wait. So what's the deal, Pop?

11:35.935 --> 11:37.747
Why couldn't you lay down the law?

11:38.106 --> 11:42.567
Well, the paperboy turned
out to be a papergirl.

11:43.247 --> 11:44.591
Yeah, you should've seen him, man.

11:44.615 --> 11:47.328
Dad went from thug life to hug life.

11:50.136 --> 11:51.524
Wait, I get it.

11:51.549 --> 11:54.607
You couldn't reprimand her
because she's a female.

11:54.858 --> 11:58.066
Look, I don't want to
make a little girl cry.

11:58.182 --> 12:00.505
I mean, what kind of
monster do you think I am?

12:00.705 --> 12:02.567
I don't know. The kind that
would make his son cry

12:02.592 --> 12:04.107
by telling him he was adopted.

12:04.231 --> 12:05.941
But that was funny, though.

12:08.682 --> 12:10.101
Pop, Pop.

12:10.126 --> 12:12.109
Don't you see that by
treating her differently,

12:12.134 --> 12:15.024
you're actually creating a
double-standard which is sexist?

12:15.387 --> 12:16.857
Sexist? Yep.

12:17.032 --> 12:19.440
It's called "being a gentleman,"

12:19.608 --> 12:21.781
which, I understand,
may be completely lost

12:21.806 --> 12:23.116
on your generation.

12:23.141 --> 12:24.899
I mean, when I was your age,

12:24.961 --> 12:29.523
we held ladies' doors, we
pulled out their chairs...

12:29.548 --> 12:31.577
You made sure they couldn't vote.

12:31.602 --> 12:33.430
My man.

12:36.653 --> 12:39.236
Let's just say we're from
two different times.

12:39.346 --> 12:41.023
All right? Back in the day,

12:41.048 --> 12:43.877
women were women, and men were men.

12:48.025 --> 12:50.398
Mmm, red.

12:55.122 --> 12:56.428
Hey, Tina. Hi.

12:56.453 --> 12:57.981
Can I ask you a question?

12:58.006 --> 13:00.854
Gem is really beating herself up
about what happened at school.

13:00.879 --> 13:02.274
She didn't even go to work today.

13:02.299 --> 13:04.002
Oh, my God. What happened?

13:04.027 --> 13:06.025
Coach McCluskey told her
that the only reason

13:06.050 --> 13:08.205
she got the job was
because she was a woman.

13:08.230 --> 13:10.190
Typical.

13:10.239 --> 13:13.136
Weak, little man threatened
by a woman in power.

13:13.161 --> 13:16.065
Mm. It's Pizza Hut all over again.

13:17.917 --> 13:19.876
Well, I-I don't know why,

13:19.901 --> 13:22.541
but for whatever reason,
she's believing this loser.

13:22.566 --> 13:24.994
You men just don't get it.

13:25.158 --> 13:26.267
In the working world,

13:26.292 --> 13:28.697
women are always made to feel less than.

13:28.922 --> 13:31.189
So, even if a jerk says
something that isn't true,

13:31.214 --> 13:33.275
you can't help but doubt yourself.

13:33.614 --> 13:37.103
Just makes me want to snip
some sense into y'all.

13:38.536 --> 13:40.669
Okay, well, how can I fix this for her?

13:40.712 --> 13:42.142
What... what, do I beat up McCluskey?

13:42.167 --> 13:45.158
Please, Dave,
that won't fix anything.

13:45.183 --> 13:47.524
Oh, thank God, 'cause that guy's huge.

13:48.291 --> 13:51.525
You know, Dave, what you can do

13:51.550 --> 13:53.111
is figure out a way to remind her

13:53.136 --> 13:54.713
of how strong and capable she is,

13:54.738 --> 13:56.305
and that she knows what she's doing.

13:56.487 --> 13:58.720
I mean, don't you do stuff
like this at your job?

13:58.832 --> 14:01.236
Well, yeah. Sure, there are
aspects of corporate consulting

14:01.261 --> 14:03.088
where I use team building
to motivate CEOs

14:03.113 --> 14:04.127
and their employee...

14:04.152 --> 14:06.399
Right, right, right, right, all of that.

14:06.941 --> 14:08.690
You know what? Actually...

14:09.056 --> 14:10.181
I just got an idea.

14:10.206 --> 14:11.627
Oh, Dave. Dave, Dave, Dave.

14:11.652 --> 14:14.106
You're not gonna show
her one of those silly

14:14.131 --> 14:15.447
Mission: Impossiblemovies

14:15.472 --> 14:17.256
that you're always talking about, right?

14:17.800 --> 14:19.774
I'm gonna come up with another idea.

14:24.994 --> 14:26.691
A rock-climbing gym?

14:27.028 --> 14:29.431
You told me we were going
to get frozen yogurt.

14:29.586 --> 14:31.080
And we will.

14:31.105 --> 14:33.774
But first, I need to remind
you of your own strength.

14:34.394 --> 14:36.291
Well, it's taking a lot of strength

14:36.316 --> 14:38.002
for me to not freak out right now.

14:38.027 --> 14:39.822
I was promised Froyo, Dave.

14:40.170 --> 14:43.649
Look, Gemma, I know that you're
doubting yourself at work.

14:43.674 --> 14:46.275
And when you're up on that wall,
you're probably gonna doubt

14:46.300 --> 14:47.603
whether you can make it to the top,

14:47.628 --> 14:49.455
but once you do,

14:49.599 --> 14:51.427
the next time you doubt yourself,

14:51.452 --> 14:53.941
you're gonna think back to
this, and you're gonna say,

14:53.966 --> 14:57.524
"Damn, I have
an awesome husband."

15:00.823 --> 15:02.564
Hey, guys.

15:02.791 --> 15:04.603
Whoa, Calvin, you look great.

15:04.628 --> 15:05.803
Rocking that harness.

15:05.997 --> 15:09.132
Well, this harness is chafing my rocks.

15:10.015 --> 15:11.886
Wait. What are you guys doing here?

15:11.911 --> 15:14.358
Tina told me we were
getting frozen yogurt.

15:16.123 --> 15:18.674
We will all go out to frozen yogurt

15:18.763 --> 15:21.023
right after Gemma
conquers this mountain.

15:21.244 --> 15:22.332
Your treat.

15:22.375 --> 15:24.116
Yes, it's my treat.

15:25.645 --> 15:27.951
Dave, I really don't
feel like doing this.

15:27.976 --> 15:29.398
Can we please just leave?

15:29.423 --> 15:32.353
Gemma, this is going to work. I promise.

15:32.378 --> 15:34.174
But I don't think I can do it.

15:34.199 --> 15:35.697
Yes, you can, Gemma.

15:35.722 --> 15:37.080
You're gonna get up there,

15:37.105 --> 15:39.482
and you're gonna make
this wall your bitch.

15:40.700 --> 15:42.944
I'm sorry, sweetie, you'll understand

15:42.969 --> 15:45.773
when you're making 70
cents to a man's dollar.

15:47.857 --> 15:50.076
Damn, look at all of this.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.732
Oh, I am.

15:52.231 --> 15:54.982
Your booty look good
in that thing, girl.

15:55.007 --> 15:57.046
You ain't lying.

15:57.071 --> 15:58.941
It's like a face-lift for the butt.

15:59.562 --> 16:03.116
I know what I'm getting
you for my birthday.

16:04.784 --> 16:06.822
Okay, let's get this over with.

16:07.159 --> 16:08.650
Where did Dave go?

16:08.681 --> 16:10.399
I don't know.

16:11.315 --> 16:13.232
I feel like Spider-Man in this thing.

16:13.813 --> 16:16.649
Really? 'Cause you look
more like Peter Pan.

16:17.975 --> 16:20.481
Okay. All right.

16:20.506 --> 16:23.482
I'm gonna attach this end of
the rope to your harness,

16:23.666 --> 16:26.147
and the other end is attached to mine.

16:26.362 --> 16:27.713
Okay, so if you slip,

16:27.738 --> 16:29.941
my body weight will
prevent you from falling.

16:29.966 --> 16:31.446
Your body weight?

16:31.906 --> 16:34.149
Please. You're built like a cricket.

16:35.053 --> 16:38.236
I'll have you know that
crickets are beloved in Asia,

16:38.261 --> 16:40.607
both for their voices and
crunchy deliciousness.

16:41.766 --> 16:43.768
Okay. Here I go.

16:43.793 --> 16:46.191
All right. Show 'em what you're made of.

16:50.041 --> 16:51.833
All right, come on, Gemma, you got this.

16:51.858 --> 16:53.775
Come on, Gemma. You go, Gemma!

16:53.800 --> 16:54.975
Yeah, hurry up.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.695
I'm starting to lose circulation

16:56.720 --> 16:58.566
in some very important places.

17:01.126 --> 17:03.353
I don't think I can reach
the next handhold.

17:03.378 --> 17:06.316
Yes, you can. Do not give
up on yourself. Let's go.

17:06.363 --> 17:07.931
I'm not. The exercise worked.

17:07.955 --> 17:10.232
I'm powerful, I'm strong.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

17:11.766 --> 17:14.478
I know that you can make it to the top.

17:14.790 --> 17:16.316
To show my faith in you,

17:16.340 --> 17:18.275
I'm gonna unhook my safety line.

17:18.300 --> 17:19.885
No. Dave! No!

17:19.910 --> 17:20.867
Dave, what are you doing?

17:20.892 --> 17:22.022
- She could fall.
- No, man.

17:22.048 --> 17:23.782
She's not gonna fall.

17:23.808 --> 17:25.398
She's pretty sure she is.

17:26.584 --> 17:28.277
Gemma. Don't move.

17:28.301 --> 17:29.390
I'm-I'm coming up to help.

17:29.415 --> 17:30.049
Yeah, help her, baby.

17:30.074 --> 17:31.940
Okay. Yeah, all right.

17:33.707 --> 17:36.149
This is...

17:40.696 --> 17:43.307
Oh. Whoa.

17:48.003 --> 17:51.482
Ah. Okay.

17:51.639 --> 17:54.524
On second thought, you're-you're
doing great up there.

17:55.060 --> 17:57.857
Dave, hook her back in before she falls.

17:57.882 --> 17:59.510
She's fine. She's not gonna fall, okay?

17:59.535 --> 18:00.885
There's padding everywhere.

18:00.910 --> 18:02.635
No one ever really gets
hurt in these places.

18:02.660 --> 18:05.815
Oh, my God, it's broken.
I know it's broken.

18:08.345 --> 18:09.712
Okay. I think I've made my point.

18:09.736 --> 18:12.611
- I'm gonna hook you back in.
- We-we're coming.

18:12.636 --> 18:15.566
Okay. I-I can't do it. I'm coming down.

18:15.741 --> 18:18.004
- Oh, Dave, cut it out.
- Oh.

18:18.028 --> 18:18.901
It wasn't me.

18:18.926 --> 18:20.144
It was me.

18:20.444 --> 18:21.838
Stop quitting on yourself,

18:21.863 --> 18:24.065
or you're getting more
foam rocks to the butt.

18:24.297 --> 18:26.182
Calvin, light her ass up.Oh.

18:26.207 --> 18:27.523
What? Oh.

18:31.606 --> 18:33.541
- Come on, baby.
- Okay, guys, guys, guys.

18:33.566 --> 18:35.829
Please, stop throwing rocks at my wife.

18:36.150 --> 18:37.941
W-We're just trying to help.

18:37.966 --> 18:40.055
It's obvious she can't do it by herself.

18:40.113 --> 18:42.245
Hey. You don't know what I can do.

18:44.996 --> 18:47.564
This is for Coach McCluskey

18:47.608 --> 18:49.273
and his stupid misogyny.

18:52.216 --> 18:55.645
And this is how angry I am
for letting him get to me.

18:58.226 --> 19:03.306
And this is for eating that
disgusting blob of banana bread.

19:04.056 --> 19:06.518
You got this, Gemma! Just one more!

19:06.543 --> 19:09.158
And this is
for anyone who thinks

19:09.183 --> 19:11.722
I can't be a badass, powerful woman

19:11.747 --> 19:13.806
in this patriarchal society,

19:13.831 --> 19:16.482
because I am!

19:18.174 --> 19:20.713
- I did it!
- Yeah, you did it!

19:20.738 --> 19:24.213
That's my friend! That's my friend!

19:24.238 --> 19:26.857
I gotta admit, that little
white girl is gangsta.

19:28.112 --> 19:31.117
All right, now, come on down.
Let's go get some Froyo.

19:31.960 --> 19:33.566
Whoa! Whoa!

19:33.591 --> 19:34.766
Wha...?

19:35.758 --> 19:37.844
O-Okay, you guys can meet us there.

19:37.869 --> 19:40.733
Dave, throw down your wallet.

19:51.428 --> 19:53.822
Ho-Ho-Ho-Ho-Hold on, hold on.

19:53.913 --> 19:56.354
Let me talk to you for a minute.

19:56.379 --> 19:57.868
Now, look.

19:57.893 --> 20:00.678
I know I told you you
were doing a great job,

20:00.877 --> 20:04.619
but the other day, I saw how
strong women can really be.

20:04.859 --> 20:07.077
So that's why I have
to tell you the truth.

20:07.245 --> 20:10.395
You are the worst
paper-person of all time.

20:11.787 --> 20:13.828
I mean, like straight trash.

20:14.955 --> 20:16.478
Okay...?

20:16.503 --> 20:18.639
And treating you like a princess

20:18.664 --> 20:22.394
is only holding you back
from your full potential.

20:22.492 --> 20:24.378
Now, you need to wake up earlier,

20:24.611 --> 20:26.709
deliver the paper on time,

20:26.765 --> 20:29.703
and for God's sake,
work on your damn aim.

20:31.135 --> 20:34.453
I mean, I'm only saying this
because I'm a feminist.

20:35.636 --> 20:38.559
