00:01.668 --> 00:02.909
<i>The</i> Enterprise <i>is preparing</i>

00:03.128 --> 00:06.838
<i>to leave Beta III
in star system C-111.</i>

00:07.341 --> 00:10.129
<i>Sociologist Lindstrom
is remaining behind</i>

00:10.344 --> 00:12.461
<i>with a party of experts
who will help restore</i>

00:12.679 --> 00:15.763
<i>the planet's culture
to a human form.</i>

00:16.058 --> 00:17.549
<i>The Late Landru, Captain.</i>

00:17.768 --> 00:19.600
<i>A marvelous feat of engineering.</i>

00:19.978 --> 00:21.935
<i>A computer capable
of directing the lives</i>

00:22.147 --> 00:22.978
<i>of millions of human beings.</i>

00:23.190 --> 00:24.977
<i>But only a machine, Mr. Spock.</i>

00:25.192 --> 00:27.275
<i>The original Landru programmed
it with all his knowledge,</i>

00:27.486 --> 00:29.853
<i>but he couldn't give it
his wisdom, his compassion,</i>

00:30.072 --> 00:31.734
<i>his understanding, his soul.</i>

00:31.949 --> 00:34.783
<i>I prefer the concrete,
the graspable, the provable.</i>

00:34.993 --> 00:37.360
<i>You'd make a splendid computer,
Mr. Spock.</i>

00:38.539 --> 00:40.030
<i>That is very kind of you,
Captain.</i>

00:41.333 --> 00:44.371
That's humorous, because Spock
is half human and half Vulcan.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.794
But he's ashamed
of his human side.

00:47.005 --> 00:48.837
That's why I
identify with him.

00:50.133 --> 00:52.796
<i>- Good luck.</i>
- I gravitate a little more towards Kirk.

00:53.011 --> 00:53.967
Why?

00:54.471 --> 00:56.087
Be-cause... everything

00:56.306 --> 00:57.672
he <i>says...</i>

00:58.058 --> 01:00.766
he makes sound
so im-portant.

01:00.978 --> 01:02.560
I should hope so...
he's the captain.

01:04.147 --> 01:05.012
Sheldon.

01:05.482 --> 01:06.268
<i>Do me a favor.</i>

01:06.733 --> 01:07.598
Go help your brother study

01:07.818 --> 01:08.934
for his math test tomorrow.

01:09.152 --> 01:10.768
Is that really a
good use of my time?

01:11.113 --> 01:12.649
Come on. I'm asking nice.

01:12.864 --> 01:15.072
If he doesn't pass, he
won't be able to play football.

01:15.284 --> 01:17.241
You realize
he's often mean to me.

01:17.452 --> 01:20.991
So? Your mother's mean to me.
I still try to be helpful.

01:21.373 --> 01:22.705
Does she break
wind on <i>your</i> head?

01:22.916 --> 01:24.657
Because that's what
Georgie does to me.

01:26.378 --> 01:27.414
Can you help me out here?

01:31.508 --> 01:33.716
I'll do it if you take
me to the train store.

01:34.052 --> 01:34.667
You got it.

01:38.140 --> 01:39.756
And buy me
whatever I want.

01:39.975 --> 01:41.056
Connie, what are you doing?

01:41.435 --> 01:42.425
Just providing

01:42.644 --> 01:46.479
my grandson
with financial guidance.

01:46.690 --> 01:47.897
Don't mock the captain.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.729
If Georgie passes his test,
I'll get you whatever you want...

01:50.944 --> 01:52.105
under 20 bucks.

01:54.156 --> 01:55.272
Deal.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.109
Why?

02:00.871 --> 02:03.113
I guess I like him
better than you.

02:05.417 --> 02:06.874
<i>Georgie?</i>

02:07.085 --> 02:07.950
- What?
<i>- Dad told me</i>

02:08.169 --> 02:09.957
<i>to help you study
for the math test.</i>

02:10.172 --> 02:11.538
I don't need your help.
Get lost.

02:11.882 --> 02:13.418
<i>Georgie,
let him help you!</i>

02:13.634 --> 02:14.715
Fine. Come in!

02:17.763 --> 02:18.594
Oh, dear.

02:18.805 --> 02:19.795
What's <i>your</i> problem?

02:20.015 --> 02:21.847
No problem.
I'll just...

02:22.142 --> 02:23.678
tidy while we talk.

02:24.770 --> 02:25.556
Help yourself.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.307
Before we start, I'd
like to get a sense

02:27.522 --> 02:29.980
- of how much algebra you know.<i>
- 'Kay.</i>

02:30.734 --> 02:32.020
Do you understand
solving and graphing

02:32.235 --> 02:34.943
- linear inequalities?
- Sure.

02:35.447 --> 02:36.813
Great. Explain it to me.

02:37.824 --> 02:38.735
Uh...

02:38.950 --> 02:40.066
first you solve 'em...

02:40.869 --> 02:42.405
and then you graph 'em.

02:43.372 --> 02:44.863
And how do you do that?

02:45.123 --> 02:45.829
Uh, you know,

02:46.041 --> 02:47.122
carefully.

02:48.043 --> 02:49.375
Excuse me.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.545
$20 isn't gonna do it.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.323
So you collect all
the terms linear in X.

03:20.534 --> 03:21.524
See? Simple.

03:21.743 --> 03:22.984
Maybe for you.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.069
No, it's simple for everybody.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.120
Now you collect all
the terms linear in Y.

03:28.291 --> 03:29.623
I don't get it.

03:29.835 --> 03:31.076
Try this.
Close your eyes.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.453
- 'Kay.
- Can you see

03:33.672 --> 03:37.006
the slope of the line given
by the coefficients of X and Y?

03:38.218 --> 03:38.924
No.

03:39.636 --> 03:40.547
What <i>do</i> you see?

03:40.887 --> 03:41.843
Darkness.

03:42.514 --> 03:43.470
Try harder.

03:44.975 --> 03:45.681
Wait.

03:46.435 --> 03:49.519
I see Elle Macpherson
in a bikini.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.353
Ooh, it just fell off.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.566
- Dad!<i>
- I'll make it $40! Keep going!</i>

03:55.694 --> 03:57.481
Maybe the problem is
you're not a good teacher.

03:57.779 --> 04:00.522
Unlikely. Regardless,
I am your only hope.

04:01.158 --> 04:02.774
What do you see
when you close <i>your</i> eyes?

04:03.702 --> 04:05.364
I see quadrant one as red,

04:05.871 --> 04:07.487
quadrant two is
soft and plush...

04:07.706 --> 04:10.574
quadrant three
smells like lavender,

04:10.792 --> 04:13.580
and quadrant four is overlaid
with a Fibonacci spiral.

04:14.504 --> 04:15.836
That's really weird.

04:16.130 --> 04:18.168
No. What's really weird
is doing simple algebra

04:18.382 --> 04:20.591
and thinking
about a girl in a bikini.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.006
I disagree.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.170
Dad!

04:24.389 --> 04:25.675
<i>Keep going.</i>

04:27.267 --> 04:27.882
<i>And when you divide</i>

04:28.101 --> 04:28.841
by a negative number,

04:29.060 --> 04:30.767
you have to reverse the
direction of the inequality.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.470
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.726
But we're not done.
You're going to fail.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.396
I get enough of what you said.
I'll be fine.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.398
<i>It was at that moment I decided</i>

04:39.613 --> 04:41.445
<i>I was not cut out for teaching.</i>

04:41.656 --> 04:43.238
<i>I consoled myself
with the knowledge</i>

04:43.450 --> 04:45.612
<i>that I was wonderful
at everything else.</i>

04:47.287 --> 04:48.869
<i>Take one
and pass it back.</i>

04:49.623 --> 04:51.410
<i>Take one and
pass it back.</i>

04:51.833 --> 04:53.324
As you all know,
this test'll count

04:53.543 --> 04:55.626
for 25% of your final grade.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.248
Be sure to show all your work.

04:57.464 --> 04:58.875
If you get stuck on a question,

04:59.090 --> 05:00.956
move on and come back to it
at the end.

05:01.176 --> 05:02.587
<i>And I shouldn't have
to say this,</i>

05:02.969 --> 05:05.302
but if there's any cheating,
I will see it.

05:05.514 --> 05:07.551
I got eyes in the back
of my head.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.382
I got more eyes than a potato.

05:10.936 --> 05:11.801
Ms. Ingram?

05:12.020 --> 05:14.137
- Yeah, Sheldon.
- I'm done.

05:14.356 --> 05:15.312
What?

05:15.524 --> 05:16.514
I enjoyed it very much.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.065
I'll take another
if you have one.

05:18.276 --> 05:20.108
No, I don't have
another one.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.357
J-Just read ahead
in the textbook.

05:22.572 --> 05:23.813
Oh, boy.

05:28.453 --> 05:29.864
<i>Seeing my brother struggle</i>

05:30.080 --> 05:31.696
<i>was difficult for me.</i>

05:32.332 --> 05:35.075
<i>As his tutor,
I took his failure personally,</i>

05:35.293 --> 05:37.159
<i>almost as if I had failed.</i>

05:37.379 --> 05:41.123
<i>Which was odd,
because I knew how dumb he was.</i>

05:41.967 --> 05:43.924
Georgie, how'd you do
on that math test today?

05:44.135 --> 05:45.046
It was tough.

05:45.262 --> 05:46.093
I don't know.

05:46.304 --> 05:47.840
I'm sorry I wasn't more help.

05:48.056 --> 05:48.887
Me, too.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.844
That's all right, baby,
you tried.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.595
Yeah. It's okay, baby.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.270
I don't understand
what went wrong.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.273
Is there any chance
you drank alcohol

05:59.484 --> 06:00.725
when you were pregnant
with Georgie?

06:01.361 --> 06:02.147
No!

06:02.362 --> 06:03.478
Well, don't be
so high-and-mighty.

06:03.697 --> 06:04.938
I drank when
I was pregnant with you.

06:05.156 --> 06:06.397
You turned out fine.

06:06.867 --> 06:07.857
These days everybody's like,

06:08.076 --> 06:09.157
"Don't drink, don't smoke."

06:09.369 --> 06:12.658
I swear. Texas is
turning into California.

06:13.248 --> 06:15.285
You realize there's nothing
I can do if you fail.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.286
You're off the team.

06:16.501 --> 06:17.332
I know.

06:17.544 --> 06:18.876
Well, I'm gonna ask Jesus

06:19.087 --> 06:21.545
to help you get
a good grade on that test.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.582
Shouldn't you have asked him
<i>before</i> he took it?

06:24.801 --> 06:26.963
The man rose from the dead...
I think he can fix a test

06:27.178 --> 06:28.294
after the fact.

06:28.513 --> 06:29.879
You know, I hear you
say things like that,

06:30.098 --> 06:32.841
and I wonder if maybe I did have
a few too many whiskey sours

06:33.059 --> 06:34.641
when you were in my belly.

06:42.277 --> 06:43.859
Not me, but not bad.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.314
I would say "A" for effort,

06:48.533 --> 06:50.616
but... that's an "F."

06:54.873 --> 06:56.489
What? How bad is it?

06:56.958 --> 06:58.119
You got a "B."

07:00.045 --> 07:01.206
Are you kidding?

07:01.630 --> 07:03.087
I don't believe it.

07:04.007 --> 07:05.464
Me, neither.

07:05.842 --> 07:06.707
Me, neither.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.046
So, I guess I have
to rethink my abilities.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.097
Clearly, I'm
a wonderful teacher.

07:15.477 --> 07:17.218
Georgie didn't pass
because of you.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.848
What do you mean?

07:20.023 --> 07:20.854
He cheated.

07:21.149 --> 07:23.562
He had the answers written
on the bottom of his shoe.

07:24.527 --> 07:25.358
He wouldn't do that.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.982
When you cheat in school,
you only cheat yourself.

07:28.782 --> 07:29.772
Where'd you get that?

07:29.991 --> 07:32.529
An inspirational poster
outside the boys' room.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.656
I saw what I saw, Sheldon.

07:36.122 --> 07:37.158
Well, if this is true,

07:37.374 --> 07:38.990
he needs to turn himself in.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.576
That'll never happen.
He'll get kicked off the team.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.252
I'm sorry, I can't
accept this.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.375
There mustbe
another explanation.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.502
If you don't believe me,
look at his shoes.

07:47.717 --> 07:48.582
I will.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.476
This is quite a workout.

08:49.154 --> 08:51.567
You dirty bird.

08:53.074 --> 08:54.281
What are you doing in here?

08:54.492 --> 08:55.653
You cheated.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.360
No, I didn't.

08:59.831 --> 09:02.039
I'm holding the evidence.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.286
Let me see that.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.291
I don't see nothin'.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.964
That's obstruction of justice,

09:11.176 --> 09:12.587
as well as disgusting.

09:12.927 --> 09:16.386
Oh, relax. By passing that test,
I get to play football,

09:16.598 --> 09:18.464
and you get to go
to the train store.

09:18.683 --> 09:19.844
Everybody wins.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.301
But what about the truth?

09:21.936 --> 09:22.801
What about it?

09:23.021 --> 09:24.978
It's supposed to set us free.

09:25.482 --> 09:26.518
Who told you that?

09:26.733 --> 09:27.564
The Bible.

09:28.443 --> 09:30.810
Since when do you care about
what's in the Bible?

09:31.071 --> 09:33.154
When it helps me
win an argument.

09:33.615 --> 09:36.358
The Bible also says honor
thy father and thy mother.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.159
And if you open your mouth,
you're gonna make them sad.

09:39.621 --> 09:40.953
<i>He had me.</i>

09:41.164 --> 09:44.328
<i>Somehow, the mullet-headed
simpleton had me.</i>

09:45.376 --> 09:46.332
This isn't over.

09:46.544 --> 09:48.251
Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do?

09:50.131 --> 09:51.793
All right, maybe it's over.

09:56.179 --> 09:57.386
<i>Meemaw?</i>

10:04.687 --> 10:07.145
I assume you've read the
Surgeon General's report

10:07.357 --> 10:08.723
on the dangers of smoking?

10:08.942 --> 10:10.979
I'm gonna wait
till they turn it into a movie.

10:11.945 --> 10:12.981
Is that your new train?

10:13.196 --> 10:17.156
Yes. It's my reward for helping
Georgie pass the math test.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.324
You don't seem too happy
about it.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.652
I don't feel like I earned it.

10:21.871 --> 10:22.952
Why not?

10:23.248 --> 10:24.534
Can you keep a secret?

10:24.749 --> 10:27.742
Well, at my age, the question
is can I remember one.

10:28.044 --> 10:28.955
Try me.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.130
Georgie cheated on the test.

10:33.967 --> 10:34.582
Oh.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.133
And nothing bad happened.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.551
He gets to stay
on the football team,

10:37.762 --> 10:38.673
Mom and Dad are proud of him;

10:38.888 --> 10:40.675
I even got a train for helping.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.136
So you're feeling guilty.

10:43.351 --> 10:44.637
Very much so.

10:46.396 --> 10:48.388
Well, that's
a real conundrum.

10:48.606 --> 10:50.222
Have you been reading the
Word of the Day calendar

10:50.441 --> 10:52.023
I gave you for
your birthday?

10:52.235 --> 10:54.522
Indubitably.

10:57.615 --> 10:58.731
So what do you think?

10:59.367 --> 11:01.279
I don't think you should
let it bother you very much.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.281
I mean, there's always gonna be
people in this world

11:03.496 --> 11:06.614
who are playing fast and loose
with the rules.

11:06.875 --> 11:08.286
And your brother's one of them.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.878
That's how Captain Kirk is
on <i>Star Trek.</i>

11:13.089 --> 11:15.832
Well, there you go, and he's,
like, the main guy on that show.

11:16.050 --> 11:18.508
No, Mr. Spock is the main guy.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.131
I stand corrected.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.474
Although Kirk is usually the one
who saves the <i>Enterprise.</i>

11:26.352 --> 11:28.935
Because he doesn't
always follow the rules?

11:29.731 --> 11:32.519
He even cheated on a test
when he was a cadet.

11:32.734 --> 11:34.191
The <i>Kobayashi Maru.</i>

11:34.402 --> 11:35.062
The what?

11:35.278 --> 11:36.064
<i>Kobayashi Maru.</i>

11:36.279 --> 11:37.986
Kirk is a legend because of it.

11:38.198 --> 11:41.612
<i>Ko-Kobayashi Maru.</i>

11:41.910 --> 11:44.072
Sounds like something
you eat at Benihana's.

11:44.287 --> 11:45.494
Have you ever been
to one of those?

11:45.705 --> 11:46.536
They make you sit
with strangers.

11:46.748 --> 11:47.955
It's crazy.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.918
Do you think a Spock
could become a Kirk?

11:53.963 --> 11:55.329
Well, in my experience,

11:55.548 --> 11:57.540
most people stay
the miserable bastards they are

11:57.759 --> 11:58.875
their whole entire life.

11:59.093 --> 12:00.209
But...

12:00.720 --> 12:03.007
I have seen some folks change.

12:05.558 --> 12:06.298
Hmm.

12:08.811 --> 12:11.224
All right. Well, I'm gonna
go play with this train.

12:11.898 --> 12:12.854
You do that.

12:30.208 --> 12:30.823
<i>Georgie?</i>

12:31.125 --> 12:31.740
Go away.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.246
<i>I need to ask
a favor.</i>

12:33.461 --> 12:34.247
What?

12:34.462 --> 12:36.294
<i>It's private. Can I come in?</i>

12:37.006 --> 12:38.213
Come on.

12:41.344 --> 12:42.380
Ugh.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.595
What do you want?

12:45.181 --> 12:47.343
It occurs to me
you have something in common

12:47.558 --> 12:48.639
with Captain Kirk.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.183
We both have cool hair?

12:50.395 --> 12:51.351
In order to succeed,

12:51.562 --> 12:53.804
you both play fast and loose
with the rules.

12:54.524 --> 12:56.106
Yeah, I suppose we do.

12:56.317 --> 12:59.151
When you cheated on the math
test, what was your strategy?

12:59.904 --> 13:01.395
Well, I guess the most
important part

13:01.614 --> 13:04.027
was not stepping on anything wet
before the test.

13:04.742 --> 13:05.823
And not getting an "A."

13:06.494 --> 13:07.780
Why wouldn't you want an "A"?

13:08.288 --> 13:10.450
'Cause that would
raise suspicions.

13:10.707 --> 13:12.073
Who would believe I got an "A"?

13:13.001 --> 13:13.661
Wow.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.162
Tell me more.

13:15.378 --> 13:17.540
Okay, when you're telling a lie,

13:17.755 --> 13:19.792
it's important to throw in
some details.

13:20.008 --> 13:22.091
Like, when I was wanted to spend
the night at Ricky's house,

13:22.343 --> 13:24.960
and Mom asked me if his mom
and dad were gonna be home,

13:25.179 --> 13:26.044
I said, not only

13:26.264 --> 13:27.425
are they be
gonna be home,

13:27.640 --> 13:28.551
his dad was gonna teach us

13:28.766 --> 13:30.883
how to cook turkey legs
in the smoker.

13:31.102 --> 13:32.968
I like turkey legs.
Were they good?

13:33.187 --> 13:35.349
There weren't any turkey legs,
you dope.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.181
His parents were in Branson.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.234
That's incredible.
I totally believed you.

13:41.070 --> 13:41.901
Details.

13:42.113 --> 13:44.526
Now get out of here,
I got to finish reading this.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.700
Thank you, Georgie,
that was very helpful.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.487
Did you hear that?

13:51.789 --> 13:52.495
What?

13:52.707 --> 13:53.697
Sounds like Georgie
and Sheldon

13:53.916 --> 13:55.032
are getting along.

13:55.251 --> 13:55.911
Really?

13:56.836 --> 13:57.792
That can't be right.

13:58.004 --> 13:58.994
I just heard it.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.129
Maybe there's hope
for those two after all.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.503
Or it's a sign of
the apocalypse.

14:03.718 --> 14:05.380
Honey, I'm-I'm watching this.

14:10.892 --> 14:12.303
So you'll have to
find someone else

14:12.518 --> 14:14.350
to hold your ankles
in P.E. today.

14:14.562 --> 14:15.848
I'm sorry, what?

14:16.064 --> 14:17.180
I've suffered a terrible injury

14:17.398 --> 14:18.855
and won't be able to attend.

14:19.067 --> 14:19.932
What happened?

14:20.401 --> 14:21.482
See for yourself.

14:24.113 --> 14:27.402
"Dear Coach Wilkins,
please excuse my son, Sheldon,

14:27.617 --> 14:28.528
"from P.E.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.030
"He has experienced
a testicular hernia,

14:31.245 --> 14:33.862
"and needs to rest for the next
six to eight weeks.

14:34.082 --> 14:35.698
Sincerely, Mary Cooper."

14:37.877 --> 14:39.038
Testicular hernia?

14:39.253 --> 14:41.586
That's called details.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.170
Ooh, that's rough.

14:45.593 --> 14:46.208
Hmm.

14:46.427 --> 14:47.133
How'd it happen?

14:47.345 --> 14:48.677
It's hard to say,

14:48.930 --> 14:52.173
heavy lifting, a chronic cough

14:52.392 --> 14:54.679
and repetitive straining
during bowel movements.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.392
I've been there.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.186
Hmm. All right.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.562
Guess I'll see you in...
six to eight weeks.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.982
<i>I don't know
if other supervillains</i>

15:10.201 --> 15:11.237
<i>started their careers</i>

15:11.452 --> 15:13.239
<i>by getting out of P.E.,</i>

15:13.663 --> 15:14.824
<i>but that's where I began.</i>

15:15.540 --> 15:17.406
<i>Emboldened by my faux hernia,</i>

15:17.625 --> 15:20.493
<i>I started taking books
out of the library...</i>

15:21.295 --> 15:23.412
<i>without getting
the cards stamped.</i>

15:23.631 --> 15:24.712
You didn't check
out those books.

15:24.924 --> 15:25.914
I know.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.425
<i>Before you judge me
too harshly,</i>

15:28.636 --> 15:30.673
<i>I always brought them back
on time.</i>

15:30.930 --> 15:33.547
<i>I was a rule-breaker,
not a lunatic.</i>

15:33.975 --> 15:36.683
<i>But perhaps my most
satisfying transgression</i>

15:36.894 --> 15:38.601
<i>was duping my sister</i>

15:38.813 --> 15:41.556
<i>into relinquishing control
of the TV.</i>

15:43.651 --> 15:44.266
Hello.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.268
What's that for?

15:46.571 --> 15:50.110
Oh, this? I was just digging
for money in Meemaw's backyard.

15:50.533 --> 15:51.944
There's money there?

15:52.160 --> 15:54.447
Oh, yes. I already
found 75 cents.

15:54.996 --> 15:56.282
Who do you think left it?

15:57.498 --> 15:58.113
If I were to guess,

15:58.332 --> 16:00.198
I'd say pirates
with holes in their pockets.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.535
Can I use your shovel?

16:03.421 --> 16:04.957
Be my guest.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.506
<i>Oh, baby,
I'm gonna be rich.</i>

16:10.386 --> 16:13.629
Today, we're going to learn
about Sir Isaac Newton.

16:14.432 --> 16:15.297
Hello, old friend.

16:15.516 --> 16:16.973
<i>...one of the world's
greatest scientists...</i>

16:21.772 --> 16:22.637
See you tomorrow, Wayne.

16:22.857 --> 16:24.393
You have a good one, George.

16:25.109 --> 16:26.441
Hey, how's your son doing?

16:26.694 --> 16:27.559
Georgie?

16:27.862 --> 16:29.148
No, the smart one.

16:30.615 --> 16:32.026
He's fine. Why?

16:32.241 --> 16:33.903
What about the hernia?

16:34.285 --> 16:35.241
What hernia?

16:35.453 --> 16:37.319
The one your wife said he had.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.749
Happened to me
while I was in the Army.

16:42.960 --> 16:46.169
I was in a bar in Georgia,
tried to lift up this big gal.

16:47.215 --> 16:49.047
Swear I could hear something
pop down there.

16:49.258 --> 16:50.590
Sheldon gave you this note?

16:50.801 --> 16:51.757
Yeah.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.255
I didn't write this.

16:53.471 --> 16:54.257
You sure?

16:54.805 --> 16:55.636
Looks like your
handwriting.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.259
It's got that little
swoopy thing going on.

16:57.475 --> 16:58.340
I didn't write it.

16:58.559 --> 17:01.097
And I think I'd know
if my son had a hernia.

17:01.312 --> 17:04.224
So what, Sheldon forged a
letter to get out of P.E.?

17:04.482 --> 17:05.689
Looks like it.

17:06.442 --> 17:07.307
How about that.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.977
Don't be proud of him.

17:10.279 --> 17:12.896
Can't help it. First time
he ever seemed like my kid.

17:14.242 --> 17:15.232
Do you have any idea

17:15.451 --> 17:16.567
what's gotten into him?

17:18.454 --> 17:19.194
I might.

17:19.704 --> 17:20.786
Well?

17:21.332 --> 17:23.118
Have you ever heard of...

17:24.126 --> 17:26.868
<i>Mobokachi Kaboom?</i>

17:27.338 --> 17:28.044
<i>Wait.</i>

17:28.297 --> 17:30.664
<i>Koshimaki Magoo.</i>

17:31.133 --> 17:32.920
Wait a minute,
I'm gonna get this.

17:36.681 --> 17:37.888
"Dear Professor Proton,

17:38.099 --> 17:39.715
"I would very much
like to meet you,

17:39.934 --> 17:42.517
"and I only have
three weeks to live.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.220
"Please come visit me here
in Medford, Texas.

17:45.439 --> 17:46.896
"Sincerely, Sheldon Cooper.

17:47.108 --> 17:49.145
P.S. My Meemaw makes
excellent brisket."

17:49.360 --> 17:50.020
<i>Sheldon.</i>

17:50.236 --> 17:51.818
Would you like
to explain this note?

17:54.240 --> 17:55.230
Well?

17:55.449 --> 17:56.235
I was trying to be

17:56.450 --> 17:57.406
more like Georgie.

17:57.618 --> 17:58.904
That's a dumb idea.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.737
We don't want Georgie
to be like Georgie.

18:02.415 --> 18:05.453
Well, let me start by saying
how very sorry I am.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.798
<i>Despite my explanation</i>

18:14.010 --> 18:16.377
<i>that I was embracing
my inner Kirk,</i>

18:16.596 --> 18:20.340
<i>my mother had me make amends
for all my misdeeds.</i>

18:20.641 --> 18:21.882
<i>Starting in the library,</i>

18:22.101 --> 18:25.139
<i>where I had to reshelve
hundreds of books.</i>

18:25.563 --> 18:27.896
<i>Well, to be honest,
that one was a hoot.</i>

18:28.441 --> 18:32.560
<i>The amends got worse when Coach
Wilkins made me climb the rope.</i>

18:33.154 --> 18:34.816
<i>Lacking any
upper body strength,</i>

18:35.031 --> 18:38.320
<i>I hung there like a salami
in a deli window.</i>

18:38.784 --> 18:42.198
<i>And finally, I had to apologize
to my meemaw,</i>

18:42.413 --> 18:46.532
<i>who was an unfortunate victim
of my sister's treasure hunt.</i>
