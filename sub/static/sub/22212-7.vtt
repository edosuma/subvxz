30:58.314 --> 31:02.277
The Black Hood killed Mr. Phillips
in a cell at the sheriff's station.

31:02.443 --> 31:03.695
How do you explain that?

31:03.862 --> 31:08.074
Kevin needs our friendship right now,
not your groundless suspicions.

31:08.491 --> 31:12.453
Don't worry, my intuition is telling me
that he's having an affair.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.873
But stay tuned while I prove it.

31:16.958 --> 31:18.167
[school bell ringing]

31:18.334 --> 31:21.421
I've been wracking my brain for something
to cheer you up,

31:21.588 --> 31:23.339
and I have just the prescription.

31:23.506 --> 31:27.176
-A sleepover. Doesn't that sound fun?
-A sleepover at The Pembrooke?

31:27.343 --> 31:30.638
Actually, Kev, I was thinking
how I've never seen your house.

31:32.098 --> 31:33.975
Thank you for sitting down with me.

31:34.142 --> 31:36.644
I'm writing a follow-up
about Mr. Phillips.

31:36.811 --> 31:38.313
I'm happy to oblige, Betty.

31:38.479 --> 31:41.107
How did the Black Hood get
to the Sugarman?

31:41.274 --> 31:43.443
-Here in the station.
-Forced entry.

31:43.610 --> 31:47.864
I was out on patrol,
and the overnight deputy, he fell asleep.

31:48.031 --> 31:50.742
But breaking into your station?
That seems--

31:50.909 --> 31:52.118
Incredibly ballsy.

31:57.040 --> 32:01.753
Have a look at this. See, the Black Hood
pried the door open from the outside.

32:02.378 --> 32:03.421
And then he just...

32:04.088 --> 32:06.549
Well, come on. I'll show you.

32:06.716 --> 32:07.842
[Keller grunts]

32:10.553 --> 32:12.472
I'll take you to the holding cells.

32:12.972 --> 32:14.766
Where he shot Phillips.

32:15.058 --> 32:17.727
So, we gathered shoeprints
and video surveillance,

32:17.894 --> 32:20.730
and everything else we could
to catch this monster,

32:20.897 --> 32:25.693
but what enrages me is that it happened
in my department, under my watch.

32:29.614 --> 32:35.119

-A glass of milk would be great.

32:46.464 --> 32:47.256
Betty?

32:47.423 --> 32:51.344
You're having a sleepover, without me,
in the middle of an investigation?

32:51.511 --> 32:52.971
This isn't an investigation.

32:53.137 --> 32:56.557
This is me helping a friend deal
with his father's infidelity.

32:56.724 --> 32:59.560
You're snooping to prove
Keller's having an affair?

32:59.727 --> 33:02.021
Why'd I leave the comforts
of the Pembrooke?

33:02.188 --> 33:04.023
Can you add "looking for evidence

33:04.190 --> 33:07.527
that suggests Keller's the Black Hood"
to your to-do list?

33:07.694 --> 33:09.570
I'd start in the home office.

33:13.408 --> 33:14.242
It's locked.

33:14.742 --> 33:18.287
-And, no, I don't have any bobby pins.
-Okay. Check the basement.

33:18.454 --> 33:21.499
I'm sure that's where
he keeps all his spare hoods.

33:25.920 --> 33:28.506
No way. I am not going down there.

33:28.673 --> 33:31.718
Please, just check to see
if something jumps out at you.

33:32.510 --> 33:33.553

Oh, Veronica. What can I do for you?

33:56.534 --> 33:58.161
I was-- I was just--

33:58.911 --> 34:01.706
Looking for juice.
Or a diet soda or something?

34:01.873 --> 34:04.709
The fridge in the kitchen is empty
and I'm parched.

34:05.293 --> 34:07.003
There's some here, I think.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.133
-There you are.
-Thanks.

I didn't know you worked out so much,
Mr. Keller. [chuckles]

34:18.598 --> 34:20.850
I mean, Archie Andrews, watch your back.

34:21.017 --> 34:24.854
I don't do it for vanity. I do it
for discipline and to push my limits.

34:25.021 --> 34:27.398
-I'm sure it comes in handy on the job.
-Yeah.

34:27.565 --> 34:30.943
Kevin mentioned things
have been stressful lately,

34:31.110 --> 34:32.987
with the Black Hood and everything.

34:33.154 --> 34:35.573
It must get super hard.

34:37.617 --> 34:40.328
With all the pressure,
without Mrs. Keller.

34:41.204 --> 34:43.581
-Where is she stationed, again?
-Bahrain.

34:43.748 --> 34:46.542
-There's a Naval base there.
-That can't be easy.

34:46.709 --> 34:49.212
How do you... cope?

34:50.630 --> 34:53.925
Veronica? What are you doing down here?

[Veronica]  I saw Kevin's dad sneaking out
in the middle of the night.

35:27.875 --> 35:30.044
And he came home at like 4 a.m.

35:31.963 --> 35:32.797
Look.

35:35.341 --> 35:39.428
A jingle-jangle addict's body was found
by the tracks this morning.

35:40.346 --> 35:43.141
It says this guy was hit
and then killed by a train.

35:43.307 --> 35:46.894
Yeah, because he was pushed
in front of it by Sheriff Keller.

35:47.061 --> 35:48.563
Or he stumbled into its path.

35:48.729 --> 35:52.233
No, think about all the locked doors
in his house. Why? Why?

35:52.400 --> 35:55.153
Because he's a private person.
Look, Betty.

35:55.319 --> 35:59.532
Let's not confuse wanting a solution
to this mystery with actually having one.

35:59.699 --> 36:01.951
This is Kevin's father
we're talking about.

And as for Betty, I...
I apologize. I mean, I--

Accusing you of being the Black Hood?
I can't imagine where she got that idea.

Well, she found my research on the case

of Archie's locker.
