M_I_SForEver

00:42.729 --> 00:42.995
All the way, baby.

00:44.964 --> 00:45.898
What do you mean you don't know?

00:45.965 --> 00:46.966
I don't know.

00:47.133 --> 00:48.033
Kaepernick almost pulled it off.

00:48.167 --> 00:49.168
Yeah, yeah.

00:49.235 --> 00:49.669
He's got confidence now.

00:51.904 --> 00:53.105
Hey, think of it, man.

00:53.172 --> 00:54.608
Saftey's in play so far back

00:54.674 --> 00:55.809
'cause they know he might run.

00:56.008 --> 00:57.544
But he's a big guy.

00:57.611 --> 00:58.712
Don't think of him as like,
you know, some little,

00:59.145 --> 01:00.480
look at all the wide receivers

01:00.547 --> 01:02.014
that take a shot
right up the middle.

01:02.181 --> 01:03.282
- He's got.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:03.349 --> 01:04.351
Hold up, hold up, stop the car.

01:04.617 --> 01:05.552
What?

01:05.619 --> 01:06.252
I think I see something.

01:29.843 --> 01:31.076
Ah, Jesus, man.

01:37.884 --> 01:38.984
God.

01:53.867 --> 01:55.167
Nine out and 144..

01:55.234 --> 01:56.235
Can you go ahead and show us 97

01:57.203 --> 02:00.072
on what appears to be a
recent homicide scene?

02:00.139 --> 02:04.109
We have a young Caucasian female

02:04.176 --> 02:08.146
covered in bruises and
lacerations, break.

02:08.615 --> 02:11.384
Including the ligature
marks on the throat area,

02:12.452 --> 02:13.986
she actually looks like
she could be associated

02:14.053 --> 02:16.021
with our recent
missing-persons case.

02:16.088 --> 02:17.824
Can you go ahead and
start a major crime scene

02:17.891 --> 02:19.024
at my location?

02:34.441 --> 02:36.175
Smells great, honey.

02:38.077 --> 02:39.078
Morning.

02:39.144 --> 02:41.180
Good morning, sweetie.

02:41.247 --> 02:42.649
Any news, dad?

02:43.783 --> 02:45.752
Oh, same old boring stuff.

02:46.720 --> 02:49.154
Well, except the state
championships this week.

02:49.221 --> 02:51.257
Does coach Haffen have
you practice on Sunday?

02:51.323 --> 02:53.225
Yeah, well the tournament
starts next month,

02:53.292 --> 02:56.095
so yeah, we're gonna have
training every Sunday now.

02:56.161 --> 02:57.196
Oh, you are.

02:59.031 --> 03:01.233
What time you comin'
home tonight, son?

03:01.300 --> 03:02.602
Practice ends at six.

03:02.669 --> 03:03.904
I should be home by 6:30.

03:04.971 --> 03:07.941
Okay, want me to
pick you up after practice?

03:08.008 --> 03:09.041
Mm-mm.

03:09.108 --> 03:10.109
Don't bother.

03:10.944 --> 03:12.344
You sure?

03:12.412 --> 03:13.480
Yeah, I like running
home after training.

03:15.180 --> 03:17.049
Can't believe
your energy level.

03:20.152 --> 03:23.289
Yeah, I actually gotta run,

03:23.356 --> 03:27.527
- but there you are.
- Oh, son, you do love me.

03:27.594 --> 03:29.261
Yeah, nothing says
I love you like bacon.

03:29.328 --> 03:30.730
Wrap it up.

03:30.797 --> 03:31.565
You got it.

03:31.631 --> 03:32.465
Thanks, mom.

03:34.568 --> 03:35.402
Thank you.

03:35.468 --> 03:36.036
Bye.

03:36.101 --> 03:37.069
Bye.

03:37.136 --> 03:38.103
Check your cell, baby.

03:38.170 --> 03:39.104
All right, you got it.

03:40.239 --> 03:42.074
All right, dad.

03:42.141 --> 03:43.009
Remember, 6:30.

03:43.075 --> 03:44.044
Yup.

03:44.109 --> 03:44.911
Be home.

03:44.978 --> 03:45.779
Got it.

03:58.658 --> 04:00.694
All right, pick it
up, come on, let's go.

04:00.760 --> 04:03.262
Quick, quick, quick,
come on, come on.

04:10.070 --> 04:11.538
Pick it up, pick
it up, pick it up.

04:11.605 --> 04:12.405
Come on, guys.

04:21.748 --> 04:23.083
All right, good job guys.

04:23.148 --> 04:24.283
Good work today.

04:35.428 --> 04:36.863
Okay, tighten up, guys.

04:36.930 --> 04:38.698
Everything good, any
questions with anything?

04:38.765 --> 04:40.199
You guys are looking good.

04:40.265 --> 04:41.300
Speed's good.

04:42.702 --> 04:46.138
Let's stay focused, somewhat.

04:46.205 --> 04:48.108
So, I think we're
gonna be pretty well.

04:48.173 --> 04:49.376
- Yeah.
- Pretty well this week.

04:49.442 --> 04:51.143
Any questions at
all, or anything?

05:06.325 --> 05:07.594
Drat.

05:07.661 --> 05:08.762
All right,
good job guys.

05:08.828 --> 05:09.496
Good hustling there.

05:09.562 --> 05:10.930
Good job.

05:10.997 --> 05:12.164
Good, good, good, good, good.

05:12.231 --> 05:13.466
You guys feeling okay?

05:13.533 --> 05:14.501
Yeah.

05:14.567 --> 05:15.502
Coach.

05:15.568 --> 05:16.335
Good job.

05:16.403 --> 05:17.370
See ya tomorrow?

05:17.437 --> 05:19.338
Yeah man, absolutely.

05:20.305 --> 05:22.642
Well, here comes Charlie, man.

05:22.709 --> 05:24.243
All right, man.

05:26.446 --> 05:27.514
What's up, Charlie?

05:27.580 --> 05:28.247
How you doin' man?

05:28.313 --> 05:29.883
Hey man.

05:29.949 --> 05:30.917
Hey Dave, we're gonna go
see some movies tonight, man.

05:30.984 --> 05:31.885
You comin'?

05:31.951 --> 05:33.486
Uh, nah, actually.

05:33.553 --> 05:34.354
I promised my dad I'd go to
the game with him tonight.

05:34.421 --> 05:35.355
All right, dude.

05:35.422 --> 05:36.221
I'll see you tomorrow man.

05:36.288 --> 05:37.724
All right, man.

05:37.791 --> 05:38.792
- First thing in the morning.
- Definitely.

05:38.858 --> 05:38.558
Tomorrow, got it.

06:15.028 --> 06:15.862
Hey.

06:17.030 --> 06:17.864
Hi.

06:31.276 --> 06:32.311
Call me.

07:29.402 --> 07:30.637
Carrie, honey.

07:31.471 --> 07:33.373
Carrie, the phone.

07:33.439 --> 07:34.474
I got it.

07:38.044 --> 07:38.878
What?

07:55.395 --> 07:57.463
Dr. Richard, these
are David Donnor's parents.

07:57.530 --> 07:59.265
David, how is he?

07:59.331 --> 08:01.100
Mr. Donner, David was involved

08:01.167 --> 08:03.536
in a car accident a
couple of hours ago.

08:04.637 --> 08:07.607
He was brought into the
hospital one hour ago.

08:07.674 --> 08:09.375
Oh, my god, where is he?

08:11.110 --> 08:12.445
He had
a serious skull fracture

08:12.512 --> 08:13.813
and internal bleeding.

08:14.781 --> 08:16.516
Had, what does that mean?

08:18.318 --> 08:20.119
David passed
away 25 minutes go.

08:20.186 --> 08:21.721
No.

08:21.788 --> 08:23.523
I'm so sorry.

08:26.759 --> 08:30.797
Get her a chair, please.

08:40.506 --> 08:41.374
A car accident?

08:41.441 --> 08:42.876
He doesn't drive.

08:42.942 --> 08:44.978
It
was a hit and run.

08:46.579 --> 08:48.248
Hit and run?

08:48.314 --> 08:49.983
Where's the driver?

08:50.049 --> 08:51.784
Is that why they're here?

08:51.851 --> 08:54.420
Sir, we're looking for
the suspect right now.

08:54.487 --> 08:55.822
Find him, then.

08:55.889 --> 08:57.490
- We're trying.
- Then find him.

08:57.557 --> 08:58.858
- Find the murderer of my son.
- Calm down, sir.

08:58.925 --> 09:00.426
- I wanna see my son.
- Sir, calm down.

09:00.493 --> 09:01.628
- Calm down, sir.
- Can't let you in there.

09:01.694 --> 09:02.495
- Is he in there?
- Sir, sir.

09:02.562 --> 09:03.630
Let me see him.

09:23.216 --> 09:25.386
It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

09:25.451 --> 09:27.086
Not David...

09:33.126 --> 09:34.027
Not David...

09:52.679 --> 09:55.181
We gave a sedative to
your wife, Mr. Donner.

09:57.250 --> 10:00.620
There is the issue of
the body to identify.

10:01.788 --> 10:04.090
It's an unavoidable
formality, I'm afraid.

10:06.926 --> 10:09.629
You can get a relative
to come in, if you wish.

10:19.038 --> 10:19.872
No.

10:23.543 --> 10:24.644
I'm his father.

10:25.478 --> 10:26.646
It should be me.

10:28.982 --> 10:30.683
You
can take your time.

10:54.307 --> 10:55.141
It's this way.

11:04.250 --> 11:05.051
Doctor.

11:18.631 --> 11:19.699
That's David.

11:21.267 --> 11:22.635
That's my son.

15:40.926 --> 15:43.162
I'd always thought
that after-funerals

15:43.229 --> 15:45.399
were for comforting siblings,

15:45.465 --> 15:49.201
family members, and
friends, of the departed.

15:50.936 --> 15:51.971
For real,

15:54.708 --> 15:55.975
there're meaningless.

15:57.678 --> 16:02.882
The real ones in pain are
the mother and father.

16:04.317 --> 16:05.985
I'm sorry, do I know you?

16:07.887 --> 16:10.056
My name is Dr. William Hobson.

16:11.123 --> 16:12.693
Are you
from the neighborhood?

16:12.759 --> 16:16.596
No, I live downtown and
I work at the hospital.

16:17.930 --> 16:20.066
I'm head of the
psychiatric department.

16:21.435 --> 16:24.970
David was brought into
our ER after the accident.

16:26.972 --> 16:29.008
I'm very sorry for
your loss, Gordon.

16:30.876 --> 16:32.011
Thank you.

16:34.648 --> 16:38.017
I lost my daughter,
Samantha, years ago.

16:40.920 --> 16:42.154
She was 18.

16:44.990 --> 16:46.460
First year in college.

16:48.060 --> 16:50.630
I'm sorry to hear that, I am.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.934
But can I ask you a question?

16:55.901 --> 16:57.571
Is this a service
of the hospital?

16:58.304 --> 16:59.740
Sending a psychiatrist?

17:00.774 --> 17:03.543
Because I honestly don't think
I really need one right now.

17:03.610 --> 17:06.278
I don't need to see
a shrink, no offense.

17:07.913 --> 17:09.281
None taken.

17:10.915 --> 17:14.887
I run a small therapy
group downtown.

17:16.790 --> 17:19.892
People like you, people like me.

17:21.627 --> 17:26.232
We get a chance to
share our feelings,

17:27.233 --> 17:28.435
lighten the burden.

17:30.169 --> 17:32.439
It isn't something I
do for the hospital.

17:33.573 --> 17:35.941
They meet at my private
office downtown.

17:38.244 --> 17:39.679
Knowing you're not alone

17:41.748 --> 17:44.851
may help to ease that grievance.

17:44.917 --> 17:46.653
You're welcome to come, Gordon.

17:49.288 --> 17:50.657
I hope to see you there.

17:51.758 --> 17:57.096
And please, give your
wife my condolences.

18:35.802 --> 18:37.637
He had 14 stitches.

18:56.088 --> 18:57.156
Donner case.

19:01.060 --> 19:02.094
Okay.

19:02.995 --> 19:03.830
Mr. Donner,

19:04.865 --> 19:08.067
in the U.S., 13% of car
crashes are hit-and-runs.

19:08.133 --> 19:11.538
In this city, that
percentage is 40%.

19:11.605 --> 19:14.106
107 people lost
their lives last year

19:14.173 --> 19:15.942
in hit-and-run collisions.

19:16.008 --> 19:17.611
The city's like a war zone.

19:17.677 --> 19:21.381
I'm not even including
murders, suicides, fights, etc.

19:21.448 --> 19:24.116
In hit-and-run cases, if the
driver turns themselves in,

19:24.183 --> 19:26.353
they just serve six
months to a year in jail,

19:26.419 --> 19:28.488
and then they get out
on the streets again.

19:28.555 --> 19:32.024
Now, in David's case, we're
working on some evidence.

19:32.091 --> 19:34.361
But I'm gonna be
honest with you,

19:34.427 --> 19:37.229
the street where the
collision happened,

19:37.296 --> 19:40.767
it has no camera records,
it was a residential area.

19:40.834 --> 19:42.469
Everybody was in their houses,

19:42.536 --> 19:44.169
probably waiting for the big
Sunday game to start on TV.

19:44.236 --> 19:46.105
There're just no eye-witnesses.

19:46.171 --> 19:47.239
What about the neighbors?

19:47.306 --> 19:48.642
Were they questioned?

19:48.708 --> 19:51.778
Or restaurants,
bars in the area.

19:51.845 --> 19:53.145
Somebody knows something.

19:53.212 --> 19:56.016
I really do
understand your pain.

19:56.081 --> 19:57.784
I don't think you do.

19:57.851 --> 19:59.886
You have no idea how many
family's I deal with every day.

19:59.953 --> 20:04.123
Now, we are dealing with dozens
of hit-and-runs right now.

20:04.189 --> 20:05.825
David's case is one of them.

20:05.892 --> 20:07.027
I give you my word on this,

20:07.092 --> 20:08.260
we are on it.

20:10.730 --> 20:11.565
Yes.

20:13.198 --> 20:14.701
Yeah, okay, in a minute.

20:20.272 --> 20:22.042
That's, is that it?

20:23.009 --> 20:26.111
I'm just one more of the
many victim's family members.

20:26.178 --> 20:28.848
Unfortunately,
I have to say yes.

20:28.915 --> 20:30.584
Now, if you'll excuse me,

20:30.650 --> 20:32.619
I have some work
to do, Mr. Donnor.

21:05.986 --> 21:06.786
Hey.

21:09.288 --> 21:11.223
What are you doing?

21:13.860 --> 21:15.829
Folding clean laundry.

21:26.171 --> 21:27.841
Okay, that's good.

21:30.944 --> 21:32.679
That's good, come on.

21:36.016 --> 21:36.850
Let's go.

21:38.150 --> 21:40.285
Let's go to our room.

22:17.256 --> 22:20.593
Did you see his
face at the funeral?

22:21.861 --> 22:23.262
He was so handsome.

22:23.328 --> 22:24.964
Carrie.

22:25.031 --> 22:26.733
He smiled like an angel.

22:32.539 --> 22:34.874
He would have been so handsome.

22:34.941 --> 22:37.377
He would have been
such a good, good man.

22:40.880 --> 22:43.149
He would have been,
he had your eyes.

22:43.215 --> 22:44.451
Carrie, stop.

22:53.225 --> 22:54.394
Stop.

24:15.441 --> 24:17.477
I'm sorry.

24:18.343 --> 24:19.344
I'm sorry.

24:21.346 --> 24:23.650
It's all right.

25:35.622 --> 25:38.124
Hey, Gordon.

25:38.191 --> 25:39.025
Hey, Robert.

25:40.727 --> 25:45.565
I just wanna say I'm
really sorry for your loss.

25:46.466 --> 25:47.834
Thanks, Robert.

25:47.901 --> 25:49.469
Uh, no.

25:50.236 --> 25:51.604
Yeah.

25:51.671 --> 25:55.108
Did you hear anything
from the police?

25:55.174 --> 25:56.542
Any leads?

25:57.176 --> 25:58.611
No, not a thing.

26:00.313 --> 26:01.547
Police know nothing.

26:03.182 --> 26:04.584
How's everything at home?

26:05.485 --> 26:06.586
How's Carrie?

26:08.554 --> 26:10.890
Carrie, you know,
Carrie, she's,

26:15.094 --> 26:16.996
I guess she's
holding it together.

26:19.265 --> 26:22.602
I need to leave the office
for a couple of hours today.

26:23.469 --> 26:25.138
Things I need to take care of.

26:26.306 --> 26:27.140
Okay.

27:12.453 --> 27:13.586
- Yes?
- Hi.

27:13.653 --> 27:14.954
I'm Gordon Donnor.

27:15.021 --> 27:17.424
I'm here to see
Dr. William Hobson.

27:17.490 --> 27:18.524
You're Gordon.

27:18.591 --> 27:20.126
Hi, I'm Karen.

27:21.694 --> 27:23.096
I heard about your son.

27:23.162 --> 27:24.431
It must have taken
a lot of courage

27:24.497 --> 27:25.665
for you to come here.

27:26.566 --> 27:28.001
Thanks.

27:28.067 --> 27:29.302
Come on in, we'll be
starting in a few minutes.

27:29.370 --> 27:30.970
Okay, thank you.

27:36.609 --> 27:39.679
Well, okay, well
let's get started.

27:39.746 --> 27:43.016
We have a new
member to our group.

27:44.317 --> 27:46.986
As we are welcoming Gordon

27:47.053 --> 27:48.921
to the group for the first time,

27:49.922 --> 27:52.692
let's start out with
introductions, shall we?

27:55.695 --> 27:57.864
I am Antonio Rugada.

27:57.930 --> 28:00.633
I'm a former
narcotics detective.

28:00.700 --> 28:02.101
I am here because my partner

28:02.168 --> 28:05.571
was killed four years
ago, in a shootout.

28:06.672 --> 28:08.941
I wasn't with her that day,

28:10.076 --> 28:14.981
and things started crashing
down all around me.

28:16.349 --> 28:20.720
I started having blackouts.

28:22.722 --> 28:25.359
Add to that alcohol and drugs,

28:25.426 --> 28:30.830
and well, the department
frowns on that, so I resigned.

28:34.435 --> 28:37.003
This group, and the good doctor,

28:39.506 --> 28:43.176
have helped me to
cope with my pain.

28:44.143 --> 28:45.211
Thank
you, Antonio, thank you.

28:47.647 --> 28:50.016
Hello, Gordon, I'm Karen.

28:50.083 --> 28:53.086
Last year, my husband
had a car accident.

28:54.354 --> 28:56.523
A drunk driver was in the
wrong lane on the highway

28:56.589 --> 28:58.257
and hit him head-on.

28:59.592 --> 29:01.594
He was in a coma for two months,

29:02.496 --> 29:04.364
and he died eight months ago.

29:06.400 --> 29:10.703
But William really helped
me to accept my loss,

29:10.770 --> 29:13.574
and to meet it head-on,

29:14.607 --> 29:18.945
and I'm really lucky to have
all these people as my friends,

29:19.912 --> 29:21.881
and we're really glad
you're here with us.

29:25.618 --> 29:27.053
Thank you, Karen.

29:31.224 --> 29:32.158
It's okay, Michael.

29:34.160 --> 29:36.162
You just need to
tell us who you are

29:37.697 --> 29:39.132
and why you are here.

29:40.066 --> 29:42.802
Just share what you're
comfortable with.

29:46.072 --> 29:47.340
I'm Michael Dorothy.

29:49.308 --> 29:52.145
My boyfriend and I were
celebrating my 32nd birthday.

29:53.846 --> 29:57.083
We went for dinner
at the Oyster Haven.

29:58.050 --> 29:59.719
I hated oysters,
but he loved 'em,

29:59.785 --> 30:01.053
so I'd pretend to love 'em too.

30:01.120 --> 30:02.221
I mean, that's
what you do, right?

30:02.288 --> 30:03.289
For people you love.

30:05.459 --> 30:06.759
He liked 'em on the half shells,

30:06.826 --> 30:09.228
a little bit of
lemon, horseradish,

30:09.295 --> 30:12.665
and I really started
liking it too.

30:16.603 --> 30:17.437
I'm rambling.

30:21.674 --> 30:23.443
We were walking
back to the subway,

30:27.113 --> 30:29.115
and a man insulted
us on the street.

30:30.917 --> 30:32.386
He called as faggots.

30:35.389 --> 30:38.257
Brian wanted to protect me,
so he went up to the man,

30:38.324 --> 30:40.394
and the man stabbed
him in the chest.

30:43.763 --> 30:45.164
He did this to my face.

30:49.302 --> 30:51.270
Brian died there right
in my lap on the sidewalk

30:51.337 --> 30:53.806
and the man just walked
away and laughed.

30:56.376 --> 30:59.345
They never found the
man that stabbed Brian,

31:02.148 --> 31:04.050
and he's still out
there somewhere.

31:05.885 --> 31:08.888
Gordon, it's your turn.

31:13.460 --> 31:14.927
I'm Gordon Donnor.

31:16.430 --> 31:21.801
A week ago, my son David
was running back home

31:22.902 --> 31:24.804
after his basketball practice.

31:27.173 --> 31:28.140
He was 16.

31:31.310 --> 31:33.513
He was hit by a car
in the neighborhood.

31:36.148 --> 31:39.285
He died shortly after he
was taken to the hospital,

31:41.355 --> 31:46.225
and they say if the driver had
stopped and called for help

31:47.893 --> 31:50.096
that he might have lived.

31:52.832 --> 31:53.899
We salute you,

31:55.736 --> 31:57.903
for your honesty and
sincerity, Gordon.

32:00.806 --> 32:03.309
One thing you'll know
about this group,

32:04.977 --> 32:06.812
we are family.

32:07.913 --> 32:09.949
You can share anything you need.

32:11.685 --> 32:13.252
You won't be judged.

32:15.355 --> 32:16.255
Not gonna be easy.

32:17.923 --> 32:19.393
Not gonna be easy.

32:20.192 --> 32:22.962
It's gonna be painful sometimes,

32:25.831 --> 32:31.037
but you will be successful.

32:36.476 --> 32:37.276
Hey.

32:37.343 --> 32:38.612
Hey, coffee?

32:38.679 --> 32:40.547
No, thank you, I'll be
up all night.

32:41.947 --> 32:43.417
What'd you think?

32:43.483 --> 32:45.151
Well, it was okay.

32:46.687 --> 32:48.254
Good.

32:48.321 --> 32:49.855
Yeah.

32:49.922 --> 32:50.923
Gordon.

32:50.990 --> 32:51.957
Nice to meet you.

32:52.024 --> 32:53.159
Nice to meet you too.

32:53.225 --> 32:54.628
See you next week?

32:54.695 --> 32:55.861
Okay.

32:55.928 --> 32:56.996
All right.

32:57.764 --> 32:58.964
Bye, sweetie.

33:09.041 --> 33:11.611
Michael has some
social issues.

33:13.513 --> 33:14.880
I can see that.

33:14.947 --> 33:16.483
He's really a great guy.

33:16.550 --> 33:17.917
You'll like him when
you get to know him.

33:17.983 --> 33:19.318
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:21.053 --> 33:22.922
Dr. Hobson's great.

33:22.988 --> 33:24.056
He really helps.

33:25.224 --> 33:27.661
You'll see when you
spend more time with him.

33:27.728 --> 33:29.429
How did you meet Dr. Hobson?

33:30.497 --> 33:31.964
The hospital.

33:32.031 --> 33:34.701
It was the day I decided
to let my husband go.

33:35.669 --> 33:38.638
He was in a coma, but there
was no brain activity.

33:40.841 --> 33:43.810
It was the hardest decision
I ever made in my life.

33:43.876 --> 33:45.044
I imagine it was.

33:52.885 --> 33:54.320
I need some more.

33:54.388 --> 33:55.522
Yeah.

34:01.361 --> 34:02.629
First days
in Westminster,

34:02.696 --> 34:03.896
I wasn't drinkin' over there.

34:03.963 --> 34:04.765
It did.

34:04.831 --> 34:06.098
I liked it there.

34:06.165 --> 34:07.634
You think
everything else is...

34:07.701 --> 34:09.668
Ah, who fuckin'
taught you that shit, man?

34:15.007 --> 34:16.909
Oh, hey,
I forgot my watch.

34:16.976 --> 34:18.143
What time is it?

34:20.045 --> 34:20.946
It's comin' up on midnight.

34:21.013 --> 34:22.081
- Thanks.
- Yep.

34:24.484 --> 34:25.485
Oh, here she
comes, here she comes.

34:25.552 --> 34:26.686
Shh, shh, shh.

34:27.721 --> 34:29.922
Do you guys have a ride,
'cause you drank a lot.

34:29.989 --> 34:31.591
Don't worry about
my ride, sweetie.

34:31.658 --> 34:32.859
My ride is fine.

34:32.925 --> 34:34.126
Just give me some,
hey, be careful,

34:34.193 --> 34:35.829
you're spilling
that shit anyway.

34:37.797 --> 34:38.998
Yeah, Georgie.

34:39.063 --> 34:40.966
I'll be all right.

34:41.033 --> 34:43.570
Aaron, did you
see that, Aaron?

34:45.539 --> 34:46.972
Fuck me.

35:01.488 --> 35:04.156
All right,
Gordon W., get out.

35:12.131 --> 35:13.733
Fuckin' cocksucker.

35:13.800 --> 35:14.601
Fuck you.

35:14.668 --> 35:15.569
Yeah.

35:15.635 --> 35:16.503
Hey, knock it off.

35:27.112 --> 35:28.247
Took him
to the emergency room.

35:28.314 --> 35:30.517
He had 14 stitches.

35:30.584 --> 35:33.920
I'm sorry, I didn't
know who to call.

35:33.986 --> 35:35.988
Well, you called
the right person.

35:37.457 --> 35:38.257
Sign here.

35:44.831 --> 35:45.699
Thank you.

35:45.765 --> 35:46.600
You too.

35:54.774 --> 35:55.609
Doctor.

35:56.476 --> 35:58.177
Property
next window.

35:59.078 --> 36:00.112
Thank you.

36:01.313 --> 36:06.285
I took the liberty of
towing your car, no charge.

36:07.521 --> 36:11.123
But you can't deal with this
pain by beating up drunk guys.

36:11.190 --> 36:12.124
Fuck.

36:12.191 --> 36:12.993
Come on.

36:13.058 --> 36:14.026
Get, get.

36:14.093 --> 36:15.996
Get him.

36:16.061 --> 36:17.364
Come on.

36:17.430 --> 36:22.469
Fuck you.

36:24.036 --> 36:25.739
Yeah, I know, I know.

36:27.039 --> 36:28.575
You're right, it was a mistake.

36:29.409 --> 36:31.511
I mean, I see your point.

36:31.578 --> 36:33.413
If you're gonna
fight these guys,

36:36.215 --> 36:39.051
this is not the way
to do that, Gordon.

36:40.119 --> 36:42.187
There're other ways.

36:45.090 --> 36:46.927
I'll get you home.

36:46.993 --> 36:48.662
Let's get you cleaned up first.

37:56.228 --> 37:57.196
Took him
to the emergency room.

37:57.262 --> 37:59.164
He had 14 stitches.

37:59.231 --> 38:00.634
How can I help you?

38:00.700 --> 38:03.737
I need to speak to
Sergeant McGinty, please.

38:03.803 --> 38:07.239
Sergeant McGinty just walked
into a meeting right now.

38:07.306 --> 38:08.808
That's okay, I can wait.

38:09.843 --> 38:12.746
Sir, his meeting will
likely be a few hours.

38:12.812 --> 38:14.848
You can leave a
message if you want.

38:16.750 --> 38:19.853
I wanna know more about
the David Donnor case.

38:19.919 --> 38:21.888
It was a hit-and-run,
happened 10 days ago.

38:21.955 --> 38:22.789
I'm his father.

38:35.001 --> 38:37.169
Sir, I'm sorry, but this
is still an open case.

38:37.236 --> 38:38.972
I can't give you any
more information.

38:39.039 --> 38:41.741
Look, if you wanna schedule
a meeting with Mr. McGinty.

38:41.808 --> 38:43.877
You know what, I do
wanna leave him a message.

38:43.943 --> 38:45.945
Tell him I wanna know what
the fuck the police are doing

38:46.012 --> 38:47.580
to find my son's murderer.

38:47.647 --> 38:49.783
Pardon me, sir, but you
can't talk like that in here.

38:49.849 --> 38:50.617
Oh, really?

38:50.684 --> 38:52.052
I can't?

38:52.118 --> 38:53.285
Officer Maloy, tell me,
how the fuck should I talk?

38:53.353 --> 38:55.287
Hey, hey, hey, relax.

38:55.355 --> 38:56.288
You don't need to handle me.

38:56.356 --> 38:57.791
This is ridiculous.

38:57.857 --> 38:59.324
Fuck should I talk?

38:59.392 --> 39:00.493
Hands off me.

39:01.394 --> 39:03.228
Hey, it's all right.

39:03.295 --> 39:04.329
I know him.

39:05.899 --> 39:07.033
Let him go.

39:07.100 --> 39:08.034
Are you sure?

39:08.101 --> 39:09.903
Yes, thank you officer.

39:11.236 --> 39:12.772
Let's go, Gordon, come on.

39:15.875 --> 39:16.710
Thank you, sir.

39:36.629 --> 39:38.398
Did you talk to the police?

39:40.200 --> 39:43.235
Yes, I did, and it's tough

39:43.302 --> 39:44.904
because they don't tell me much.

39:46.439 --> 39:48.541
So try not to dwell
on it too much.

39:50.143 --> 39:53.613
And in the meantime, you
need to take your pills.

39:56.116 --> 39:57.417
Take them why?

39:58.250 --> 39:59.619
To forget about David?

40:01.121 --> 40:05.324
No, no, to accept the
fact that he is gone.

40:05.391 --> 40:06.826
The fact,

40:08.628 --> 40:12.565
the fact that every time
I look at your face,

40:14.367 --> 40:15.668
I see my David.

40:18.872 --> 40:21.174
Tell me how to
forget that, tell me.

40:21.241 --> 40:24.711
You're not the only one who
has to live through all this.

40:24.778 --> 40:26.212
I hurt too.

40:26.278 --> 40:27.714
But where is he?

40:28.915 --> 40:30.116
Where is the driver?

40:30.183 --> 40:32.886
Where is the man
who killed my son?

40:34.587 --> 40:36.990
Why don't they do something?

40:37.056 --> 40:38.191
Calm down, take it easy.

40:38.258 --> 40:39.291
Don't tell me to calm down.

40:41.293 --> 40:43.429
Don't tell me to take it easy.

40:45.365 --> 40:47.700
And don't look at me like that.

40:47.767 --> 40:50.335
Don't you dare pity me, Gordon.

40:50.403 --> 40:52.605
You don't know how this feels.

40:56.543 --> 40:58.378
Actually, I do.

41:17.797 --> 41:19.499
Let's have dinner.

41:22.435 --> 41:23.670
Carrie, I'm sorry.

41:35.114 --> 41:36.516
Where's Michael?

41:37.349 --> 41:39.018
Well, I called, no answer.

41:40.520 --> 41:42.655
Okay, well let's
start without him.

41:44.224 --> 41:49.629
Today, we're gonna talk
about wishes and desires.

41:50.597 --> 41:54.901
Gordon, what do you
wish for in life?

41:58.171 --> 42:01.941
I wish I could go back
to the day I lost David.

42:03.443 --> 42:06.145
I'd ask him what
he thought of me,

42:07.413 --> 42:09.549
if I was a good dad to him.

42:12.285 --> 42:15.388
I wish I had picked him
up from practice that day.

42:20.026 --> 42:23.463
You know, every
night, I close my eyes

42:23.529 --> 42:25.431
and I think of the
driver who hit David

42:25.498 --> 42:26.966
and then just left him there.

42:29.836 --> 42:33.374
He's still out there,
somewhere, living life,

42:34.375 --> 42:39.112
walking, eating,
laughing, fucking.

42:44.984 --> 42:49.822
What I wish is that God's
justice really did exist.

42:51.190 --> 42:53.726
I could rest assured
that that person

42:53.793 --> 42:55.695
would be getting
what he deserved.

42:57.931 --> 43:02.168
Well, revenge, that's
a powerful feeling.

43:05.772 --> 43:08.942
It's like a, it's like a poison,

43:10.476 --> 43:14.447
and if you don't get rid of
it, it could consume your life.

43:15.448 --> 43:17.083
If you were to find that guy,

43:19.485 --> 43:21.721
what would you do to him?

43:21.788 --> 43:25.525
Would you punish him?

43:26.693 --> 43:27.727
Or forgive him?

43:32.532 --> 43:35.301
I guess I believe
in a little of both.

43:37.637 --> 43:40.873
And I've always seen
myself as a decent person.

43:41.908 --> 43:45.144
A person who obeys laws
and believes in them.

43:46.012 --> 43:50.883
A person who's
capable of forgiving.

43:52.552 --> 43:56.622
And I've always seen
myself as a person

43:56.689 --> 43:59.826
who would never do harm
to another human being.

44:02.295 --> 44:07.667
So if I am to answer
your question, doctor,

44:08.868 --> 44:13.806
I guess it comes down to what
kind of person I am today.

44:17.944 --> 44:22.682
And if I were to look deep
into my hidden depths,

44:24.250 --> 44:26.586
I think I'd see
someone much different.

44:31.290 --> 44:32.959
Ah, let me guess.

44:34.927 --> 44:37.163
Hey, let's, all right.

44:38.865 --> 44:39.699
Yep.

44:42.135 --> 44:46.606
Oh, god.

44:48.708 --> 44:51.844
Michael, Michael, what
the fuck are you doing?

44:51.911 --> 44:55.214
I told you not to do
anything, didn't I?

44:55.281 --> 44:56.082
Get your ass in here.

44:56.149 --> 44:57.216
Get on back there.

44:57.283 --> 44:59.118
God dammit, Michael.

44:59.185 --> 45:00.686
Get over the fuck
back here, now.

45:00.753 --> 45:02.356
What are you doing?

45:02.423 --> 45:03.589
God dammit.

45:03.656 --> 45:05.825
Come on, get the fuck in here.

45:05.892 --> 45:07.560
The fuck you think
you're doing, man?

45:07.627 --> 45:08.728
Huh?

45:09.530 --> 45:10.963
You don't need to go in there.

45:11.030 --> 45:12.466
It's fine, it's okay,
don't worry about it.

45:12.533 --> 45:13.800
Are you kidding me?

45:13.866 --> 45:14.801
Yeah, it's fine.

45:14.867 --> 45:15.802
it's absolutely fine.

45:15.868 --> 45:17.336
What the hell happened?

45:17.404 --> 45:18.738
He probably had a fight.

45:19.972 --> 45:21.542
Yeah, I'm always pushing him

45:21.607 --> 45:22.875
to take his
medication, everyday,

45:22.942 --> 45:24.744
and he probably didn't.

45:25.678 --> 45:26.979
Look, I'll take care of Michael.

45:27.046 --> 45:30.316
Let's just end the
session today, all right?

45:30.384 --> 45:32.585
Gordon, see you tomorrow.

45:32.652 --> 45:33.686
Thank you, thank you both.

45:33.753 --> 45:35.655
Hey, let's just go, okay?

45:35.721 --> 45:37.690
Come on, come on.

45:37.757 --> 45:40.360
Karen, just wait a minute.

45:40.427 --> 45:42.228
All that blood, and
you think it's okay?

45:42.295 --> 45:44.097
Ah, he's had a couple
of fights before,

45:44.163 --> 45:45.965
and this is probably
just the last one.

45:46.032 --> 45:47.133
I mean.

45:47.200 --> 45:48.835
But it's
happened before?

45:48.901 --> 45:49.702
Yeah, but
William can't force him

45:49.769 --> 45:50.870
to take his meds,

45:50.937 --> 45:52.338
he can just sort of remind him,

45:52.406 --> 45:54.307
and when he doesn't,
this is what happens.

45:54.374 --> 45:55.208
Come on.

45:57.343 --> 45:58.579
If you say so.

45:58.644 --> 46:01.314
Hey, you wanna
get some coffee?

46:09.490 --> 46:12.392
Well that was some
crazy shit back there.

46:17.364 --> 46:18.131
Thank you.

46:18.197 --> 46:19.031
Thanks.

46:23.202 --> 46:25.872
You know, the state wanted
to have Michael committed,

46:25.938 --> 46:28.040
after he had that last
breakdown at work,

46:28.107 --> 46:29.909
and William convinced
the authorities

46:29.976 --> 46:34.414
to release Michael into this
doctor-sponsored probation,

46:34.481 --> 46:37.683
so that Michael would be
under William's control.

46:39.185 --> 46:41.320
But Michael lost his
boyfriend and his job,

46:41.388 --> 46:43.390
and I can understand
how he feels.

46:44.790 --> 46:46.393
Understand him?

46:46.460 --> 46:47.293
Are you serious?

46:48.495 --> 46:51.063
Maybe what Michael needs
is to be in an institution.

46:52.265 --> 46:55.301
Right, well, yes, after
an incident like this,

46:55.369 --> 46:57.837
I'm sure he'll
probably be committed.

46:59.573 --> 47:00.474
You're right.

47:00.541 --> 47:01.642
I would think so.

47:01.707 --> 47:02.442
Yeah.

47:02.509 --> 47:03.342
Sorry.

47:05.311 --> 47:06.145
Hi.

47:08.714 --> 47:09.749
Yes.

47:10.750 --> 47:11.784
Right.

47:12.685 --> 47:13.753
Okay.

47:13.819 --> 47:15.054
Yeah, see ya.

47:16.822 --> 47:18.659
Everything all right?

47:18.724 --> 47:19.926
Yeah, it's what I thought.

47:19.992 --> 47:21.495
Michael got into
a fight in a bar,

47:21.562 --> 47:24.997
and William and Antonio
are taking care of it.

47:25.064 --> 47:25.898
Ah.

47:37.777 --> 47:38.878
Okay.

47:40.614 --> 47:41.648
Oh, you know what?

47:41.714 --> 47:43.383
What, what's wrong?

47:43.450 --> 47:44.951
I forgot my jacket.

47:45.017 --> 47:47.053
It's okay, I'll go
back for it later.

47:47.987 --> 47:49.656
- It's fine.
- Okay.

47:49.722 --> 47:51.791
Well, goodnight Gordon.

47:51.857 --> 47:53.859
Goodnight, Karen.

48:22.356 --> 48:25.425
What
were you thinking?

48:26.593 --> 48:29.161
I don't know.

48:29.228 --> 48:32.366
Yeah, you're a fuckin' idiot.

48:32.432 --> 48:33.799
You know that?

48:35.502 --> 48:36.436
A fuckin' idiot.

48:36.503 --> 48:37.770
I said I was sorry.

48:37.837 --> 48:38.938
You are?

48:39.872 --> 48:41.807
Well live by the sword, die.

49:11.904 --> 49:13.105
Ah, blondie.

49:17.810 --> 49:18.779
Antonio.

49:18.844 --> 49:19.879
Hey.

49:20.747 --> 49:21.715
Same as usual?

49:21.782 --> 49:22.882
Sure, yeah.

49:26.787 --> 49:27.587
Same as always?

49:27.654 --> 49:28.622
Yeah, sure.

49:28.689 --> 49:29.356
How 'bout your friend?

49:30.724 --> 49:31.458
Uh, give me a pug.

49:31.525 --> 49:32.359
Pug?

49:33.225 --> 49:34.193
Ugly dog.

49:36.095 --> 49:38.097
And you're obviously
a regular here.

49:38.164 --> 49:38.931
Oh, yeah.

49:38.998 --> 49:40.032
Thank you.

49:41.435 --> 49:42.268
Cheers.

49:47.474 --> 49:48.908
Off the wagon, huh?

49:49.776 --> 49:51.010
Never on, never off.

49:52.845 --> 49:54.213
Ah, moderation.

49:55.848 --> 49:57.784
Even that's been a
challenge for me, lately.

49:57.850 --> 49:59.118
I bet.

49:59.185 --> 50:00.319
But I'm managing.

50:02.422 --> 50:06.125
Speaking of managing,
how's Michael?

50:07.561 --> 50:08.628
He's okay.

50:08.695 --> 50:09.629
Yeah?

50:09.696 --> 50:11.063
He broke his parole.

50:11.130 --> 50:15.000
We had to intervene,
but he's clean now.

50:15.901 --> 50:16.837
What do you mean
he's clean now?

50:16.902 --> 50:18.237
What's the problem?

50:18.304 --> 50:19.939
He had a fight.

50:20.940 --> 50:22.409
Stitches.

50:22.476 --> 50:23.543
He got stitches?

50:23.610 --> 50:25.277
Well,
not him, other guy.

50:25.344 --> 50:26.245
Oh.

50:26.312 --> 50:27.547
But I talked to him.

50:27.614 --> 50:28.382
He said he wouldn't sue, so.

50:29.649 --> 50:30.751
That's good news.

50:30.817 --> 50:31.618
Yeah.

50:31.685 --> 50:32.952
He's lucky.

50:33.018 --> 50:34.987
Get your ass sued
for hittin' someone.

50:35.054 --> 50:36.088
Yeah.

50:39.959 --> 50:41.327
How you doin'?

50:43.896 --> 50:45.331
I don't even know how

50:45.399 --> 50:47.166
to answer that question
right now, Antonio.

50:47.233 --> 50:50.704
Let's get some
air, what do you say?

50:50.771 --> 50:51.605
Smoke one.

50:53.973 --> 50:55.040
Heading out?

50:55.107 --> 50:55.742
You want money?

50:55.809 --> 50:56.743
Please.

50:56.810 --> 50:57.744
All right.

50:57.811 --> 50:58.745
Goodnight, Antonio.

50:58.812 --> 50:59.713
Thank you.

50:59.780 --> 51:00.547
See ya later, pal.

51:00.614 --> 51:01.180
Thank you.

51:10.791 --> 51:14.093
You know, I saw you
and Michael that day.

51:14.960 --> 51:16.763
What day?

51:16.830 --> 51:19.499
Last week, after
our group session.

51:19.566 --> 51:20.367
Oh.

51:20.434 --> 51:21.668
The parking lot.

51:21.735 --> 51:23.102
I forgot my jacket, so
I went back to get it.

51:24.003 --> 51:25.171
Oh, yeah.

51:25.237 --> 51:26.673
Sure it was me?

51:26.740 --> 51:27.908
I mean, it's pretty dark
in that parking lot.

51:28.007 --> 51:29.275
I thought it was you.

51:29.341 --> 51:31.110
I mean, did you see anything?

51:31.944 --> 51:32.978
I mean.

51:34.213 --> 51:35.247
No, nothing.

51:36.817 --> 51:37.584
Why, should I have?

51:37.651 --> 51:38.485
No.

51:39.985 --> 51:41.987
Is everything all right?

51:42.054 --> 51:43.490
Yeah, no problem.

51:43.557 --> 51:44.458
Everything's fine.

51:45.459 --> 51:46.292
Good.

51:48.628 --> 51:49.463
That's good.

51:52.031 --> 51:53.500
Then tomorrow, right?

51:53.567 --> 51:55.802
Yeah, see
you tomorrow, group.

51:55.869 --> 51:57.269
See you at group.

51:57.336 --> 51:59.372
All right.

52:27.501 --> 52:30.370
Do you question my
methods from time to time?

52:31.371 --> 52:33.507
Ah, my methods
are your methods.

52:33.573 --> 52:34.741
You know that.

52:36.476 --> 52:39.178
What's your
thoughts on Gordon Donnor?

52:40.179 --> 52:43.182
Oh, he's damaged, just
like the rest of us.

52:44.384 --> 52:45.184
Exactly.

52:47.286 --> 52:50.189
He's searching
for a way in life,

52:51.525 --> 52:56.095
where the good
overcomes the bad.

52:57.162 --> 52:58.230
Oh, yeah.

52:59.933 --> 53:01.300
He's the walking wounded.

53:02.602 --> 53:04.804
He's looking for a way to heal.

53:09.208 --> 53:10.377
He needs all of us.

53:16.750 --> 53:17.717
And Michael?

53:19.151 --> 53:20.687
Oh, that's done.

53:20.754 --> 53:21.922
He's done.

53:21.988 --> 53:22.789
It's finished.

53:24.424 --> 53:27.059
I think Gordon saw us last week.

53:27.794 --> 53:29.061
What'd he see?

53:29.128 --> 53:31.230
He said he didn't
see anything, but.

53:34.467 --> 53:35.301
Okay.

53:37.404 --> 53:39.238
We'll take it to the next level.

53:42.274 --> 53:43.743
I'll talk to him tonight.

53:45.077 --> 53:46.078
All right.

53:46.880 --> 53:49.583
I'll be at the bar.

53:49.649 --> 53:50.650
Need anything?

53:50.717 --> 53:51.651
Be careful.

53:52.786 --> 53:53.687
All right, doc'.

54:16.910 --> 54:17.744
Hey.

54:28.153 --> 54:29.188
Gordon?

54:30.624 --> 54:31.458
Yeah?

54:36.195 --> 54:37.364
I wanna visit David.

54:56.315 --> 54:57.684
Are you okay?

54:59.719 --> 55:00.553
I don't know.

55:35.055 --> 55:39.426
Well, we're changing
things up here a little bit.

55:40.727 --> 55:44.329
I'm gonna, I'm
gonna tell a story.

55:46.265 --> 55:48.601
Samantha's story.

55:50.202 --> 55:51.004
My daughter.

55:59.045 --> 56:01.715
Greatest pain in my
life was losing her.

56:05.952 --> 56:07.787
It was five years ago.

56:11.825 --> 56:16.596
I can't even imagine what
her face looks like now.

56:18.498 --> 56:19.532
And it's true,

56:25.138 --> 56:26.439
they say time heals.

56:30.110 --> 56:35.014
It also erases the freshness,

56:35.982 --> 56:39.753
the intimate details of
something so precious.

56:45.358 --> 56:46.426
No, no, please, no, no.

56:46.493 --> 56:47.292
No, wait, no.

56:47.360 --> 56:48.461
I have money.

56:48.528 --> 56:49.429
Get in the fucking car,

56:49.496 --> 56:51.765
- you bitch.
- No, no.

57:03.009 --> 57:08.381
These are the two
who kidnapped Samantha.

57:15.488 --> 57:20.460
Jordan Nile and Carlos Juarez.

57:24.097 --> 57:28.835
Two small time thugs,
with criminal records.

57:33.940 --> 57:38.444
They kidnapped my daughter,
then they raped her.

57:40.180 --> 57:43.483
They beat her for
three, three days.

57:45.451 --> 57:46.486
Three,

57:48.988 --> 57:49.823
three days.

57:53.660 --> 57:58.498
Then they drove her
out to a forest,

58:02.135 --> 58:07.040
and dumped her body
on the side of the,

58:08.007 --> 58:10.243
the road.

58:10.310 --> 58:11.343
Road.

58:12.212 --> 58:13.012
I'm sorry.

58:14.280 --> 58:17.951
I met Dr. Hobson four
years ago, in the hospital.

58:19.652 --> 58:22.055
I started to see him
on a regular basis

58:22.121 --> 58:23.556
because of my blackouts.

58:26.292 --> 58:27.794
He's more than my doctor.

58:30.129 --> 58:30.964
He's my friend.

58:32.732 --> 58:37.937
He's our team leader, if you
really wanna know the truth.

58:40.240 --> 58:41.074
Right, doc'?

58:42.508 --> 58:43.543
You're our leader.

58:51.284 --> 58:52.752
No, help.

58:57.790 --> 58:59.692
Stay down, fucker.

58:59.759 --> 59:00.727
Yeah.

59:01.895 --> 59:02.729
Fucker.

59:06.432 --> 59:07.567
No, ay, no.

59:08.868 --> 59:09.602
No.

59:29.222 --> 59:34.093
Four years ago, we found them.

59:36.529 --> 59:40.600
I killed Carlos Juarez
and Jordan Nile.

59:43.102 --> 59:47.607
We dumped their bodies.

59:50.143 --> 59:51.444
I saved my soul,

59:53.546 --> 59:57.650
and my Samantha is
finally at peace,

59:57.717 --> 01:00:02.655
knowing those monsters
are in that river.

01:00:04.924 --> 01:00:05.758
What?

01:00:06.793 --> 01:00:08.628
You could say I was,

01:00:10.463 --> 01:00:11.631
I was reborn.

01:00:13.633 --> 01:00:15.635
Is this some
kind of sick joke?

01:00:16.403 --> 01:00:18.338
No, no, no, it's not.

01:00:18.405 --> 01:00:19.706
- It's...
- Karen.

01:00:19.772 --> 01:00:21.074
William and Antonio
helped me find

01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:23.276
that drunk driver that
killed my husband.

01:00:23.977 --> 01:00:25.878
His name was Norman Ferguson.

01:00:27.046 --> 01:00:27.880
And what?

01:00:29.582 --> 01:00:32.652
Yeah, I killed him.

01:00:37.123 --> 01:00:39.826
So, Michael.

01:00:40.827 --> 01:00:44.564
Don't you have something
to say to the group?

01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:45.832
Isn't that right?

01:00:45.898 --> 01:00:48.001
I owe you all an apology.

01:00:50.837 --> 01:00:53.940
I didn't listen to Antonio
and the doctor last week.

01:00:55.308 --> 01:00:59.579
When Antonio showed me
who stabbed my boyfriend,

01:01:00.747 --> 01:01:05.918
I took the address, went to
his home, and I beat him.

01:01:07.354 --> 01:01:08.521
I beat him to death.

01:01:11.124 --> 01:01:14.160
I should have listened to you
and followed the same path.

01:01:16.963 --> 01:01:19.866
I should have came to you
all for help, but I didn't.

01:01:19.932 --> 01:01:20.933
Enough.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.835
I've heard enough
from all of you.

01:01:22.902 --> 01:01:25.238
This is, this,
this is not right.

01:01:25.304 --> 01:01:27.707
You, you, you people,
what the hell is that?

01:01:30.009 --> 01:01:31.144
It's a file.

01:01:31.210 --> 01:01:32.078
What does it look like?

01:01:33.546 --> 01:01:34.981
Just read it.

01:01:35.048 --> 01:01:36.082
It's from
the police department.

01:01:36.149 --> 01:01:36.983
How 'bout that?

01:01:40.787 --> 01:01:42.088
Who the hell is this?

01:01:43.890 --> 01:01:45.291
- This is.
- It's Boyd.

01:01:45.359 --> 01:01:46.292
Boyd?

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.060
Yeah, Gerald.

01:01:49.929 --> 01:01:52.298
Is this the person
who hit David?

01:01:52.366 --> 01:01:53.699
Is that what you're saying?

01:01:53.766 --> 01:01:54.567
Yes, that's
what we're saying.

01:01:54.634 --> 01:01:56.069
What do you mean?

01:01:56.135 --> 01:01:57.270
Left him
bleeding in the street.

01:01:57.336 --> 01:01:58.738
That's right.

01:01:58.805 --> 01:01:59.906
For you.

01:02:01.674 --> 01:02:02.543
How can you be certain?

01:02:02.642 --> 01:02:04.243
I mean, what if.

01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:05.645
Now, look, look,

01:02:05.711 --> 01:02:07.180
Boyd is up to here
with priors, all right?

01:02:07.246 --> 01:02:10.384
Drunk driving, domestic
abuse, aggravated assault.

01:02:10.451 --> 01:02:11.518
We checked this guy out.

01:02:11.584 --> 01:02:12.618
We're sure.

01:02:12.685 --> 01:02:13.753
How, how can you be sure?

01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:15.121
We do our homework, Gordon.

01:02:15.188 --> 01:02:16.589
We do our homework.

01:02:16.656 --> 01:02:18.291
You can believe what
you wanna believe,

01:02:18.358 --> 01:02:21.327
but that man killed your son.

01:02:21.395 --> 01:02:23.564
The police have been looking
for him for over a month,

01:02:23.629 --> 01:02:25.064
and then you come out of nowhere

01:02:25.131 --> 01:02:26.833
and show me a picture of a
guy that could be anybody,

01:02:26.899 --> 01:02:29.902
and you say it's him, it's
the guy that killed David?

01:02:29.969 --> 01:02:31.170
Yes.

01:02:31.237 --> 01:02:32.271
- It just doesn't seem real.
- You want proof?

01:02:32.338 --> 01:02:33.139
You want proof?

01:02:33.206 --> 01:02:34.107
Look at page two.

01:02:34.173 --> 01:02:35.141
Yeah, check it out.

01:02:35.208 --> 01:02:36.109
Look at it.

01:02:36.175 --> 01:02:37.110
Look at the invoice, the date.

01:02:37.176 --> 01:02:37.944
Look at it.

01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:38.911
He's a killer, Gordon.

01:02:38.978 --> 01:02:39.879
He deserves to die.

01:02:39.946 --> 01:02:40.613
Mm, you see that?

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:41.747
Yeah.

01:02:41.814 --> 01:02:43.049
The day after David was hit.

01:02:43.116 --> 01:02:44.016
- Yeah.
- A replaced headlight.

01:02:44.083 --> 01:02:45.218
So what?

01:02:45.284 --> 01:02:47.421
- A replaced headlight.
- Headlight, yeah.

01:02:47.488 --> 01:02:48.589
You remember that?

01:02:48.654 --> 01:02:49.722
The police didn't inform anyone.

01:02:49.789 --> 01:02:51.090
You know why?

01:02:51.157 --> 01:02:54.260
They cannot breathe
right now, okay?

01:02:54.327 --> 01:02:55.728
We fill in the gaps.

01:02:55.795 --> 01:02:56.762
That's what we do.

01:02:56.829 --> 01:02:58.131
Yeah.

01:02:58.197 --> 01:02:59.198
What do you mean
you fill in the gaps?

01:02:59.265 --> 01:03:00.567
To help you.

01:03:00.633 --> 01:03:01.535
They
have a hundred and...

01:03:01.602 --> 01:03:02.503
Did you plan this?

01:03:02.569 --> 01:03:03.870
Oh, God.

01:03:03.936 --> 01:03:05.204
Did you people
plan this all along?

01:03:05.271 --> 01:03:06.706
To try and set me up
to get me to kill?

01:03:06.772 --> 01:03:08.241
You people kill people,

01:03:08.307 --> 01:03:09.775
and then try to justify it

01:03:09.842 --> 01:03:10.843
- with...
- Gordon, Gordon,

01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:11.744
- Gordon.
- We don't.

01:03:11.811 --> 01:03:13.012
Just read it.

01:03:13.079 --> 01:03:15.882
We really care for
your wellbeing.

01:03:15.948 --> 01:03:17.316
- Do you?
- Believe me.

01:03:17.384 --> 01:03:18.519
We're
setting it right, Gordon.

01:03:18.585 --> 01:03:19.752
I don't know how to feel

01:03:19.819 --> 01:03:20.753
- about you people anymore.
- Oh, God.

01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:22.221
You know what?

01:03:22.288 --> 01:03:23.689
- Just read it, please.
- Don't leave, man.

01:03:23.756 --> 01:03:24.824
- Just read it.
- Don't leave.

01:03:24.891 --> 01:03:25.057
I am not, I can't...

01:03:26.058 --> 01:03:27.528
You're making a
big mistake, man.

01:03:27.594 --> 01:03:29.463
I can't.

01:03:29.530 --> 01:03:30.631
I can't.

01:03:30.696 --> 01:03:31.964
Come on, man.

01:03:33.799 --> 01:03:34.767
- All right, all right.
- Let him go, let him go,

01:03:34.834 --> 01:03:36.202
let him go.

01:03:36.269 --> 01:03:39.071
- He will return.
- All right, all right.

01:03:39.805 --> 01:03:41.941
- Ah, shit.
- You all did.

01:04:50.876 --> 01:04:52.945
What are we doing here?

01:04:53.012 --> 01:04:54.747
Is this about David's case?

01:04:55.716 --> 01:04:56.683
Cars in
impound stays there

01:04:56.749 --> 01:04:58.784
'til the investigation.

01:05:08.595 --> 01:05:09.429
Yes?

01:05:10.830 --> 01:05:12.599
Gordon Donnor.

01:05:12.666 --> 01:05:13.933
This is my wife, Carrie.

01:05:15.001 --> 01:05:17.571
Yes, of course,
the Donnor case.

01:05:17.638 --> 01:05:18.904
I remember now.

01:05:20.574 --> 01:05:23.175
Well, there's nothing new
to say about the case.

01:05:24.777 --> 01:05:26.345
Gordon?

01:05:26.413 --> 01:05:29.248
Mr. Donnor, you don't have
to come here every week.

01:05:29.315 --> 01:05:31.250
We'll inform you if
there is any development

01:05:31.317 --> 01:05:32.251
with David's case.

01:05:37.557 --> 01:05:38.958
You know what?

01:05:39.025 --> 01:05:41.327
- You're right.
- Gordon, watch it.

01:05:43.896 --> 01:05:45.699
We should never
have come here.

01:05:45.766 --> 01:05:46.767
This system is broken.

01:05:46.832 --> 01:05:47.933
You're broken.

01:05:48.868 --> 01:05:49.835
I'm broken.

01:05:49.902 --> 01:05:50.803
Mr. Donnor.

01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:51.937
We're all broken.

01:05:59.045 --> 01:06:01.180
How did you find him?

01:06:03.583 --> 01:06:04.884
That's what I do.

01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:05.985
I find people.

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.690
Been doin' it 20 years.

01:06:09.756 --> 01:06:11.525
We found that son of a bitch.

01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:17.997
Fuckin' dick.

01:06:18.964 --> 01:06:21.000
He's been divorced
for two years.

01:06:21.067 --> 01:06:22.602
His wife fuckin' hates him.

01:06:22.669 --> 01:06:25.304
That explains assault
and battery charges.

01:06:27.407 --> 01:06:29.942
He's a drunk, he's
a troublemaker,

01:06:30.009 --> 01:06:32.044
he's fucked up,
that's what he is.

01:06:32.912 --> 01:06:34.448
Oh, and get this.

01:06:35.147 --> 01:06:37.049
He owns a gun shop.

01:06:37.917 --> 01:06:39.885
He sells guns.

01:06:39.952 --> 01:06:41.655
That's fucked up, isn't it?

01:06:41.722 --> 01:06:43.856
Been fucked up for two years,

01:06:43.923 --> 01:06:45.425
'til it all came to a head

01:06:46.626 --> 01:06:49.862
when he ran over your son
in the fuckin' street.

01:06:49.929 --> 01:06:52.031
Fuckin' asshole.

01:06:55.267 --> 01:06:58.170
Oh, he's gonna get his.

01:07:02.074 --> 01:07:03.477
Is that it?

01:07:03.543 --> 01:07:05.111
The truck, is that his?

01:07:05.177 --> 01:07:07.748
Oh yeah, that's the truck
that ran over your son.

01:07:07.814 --> 01:07:09.248
That's his.

01:07:09.315 --> 01:07:11.183
Probably still has blood
on the front of it.

01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:14.987
- I'm not just gonna sit here.
- No, no, don't get out.

01:07:15.054 --> 01:07:15.988
No, no, no.

01:07:16.055 --> 01:07:17.156
Don't fuckin' do it, man.

01:07:17.223 --> 01:07:18.023
You out of your fuckin' mind?

01:07:18.090 --> 01:07:19.125
No, I'm not.

01:07:19.191 --> 01:07:20.560
I know what I'm doin' here.

01:07:20.627 --> 01:07:22.763
Just close it, quietly,
please, please.

01:07:22.829 --> 01:07:24.531
We gotta do this
thing right, man.

01:07:24.598 --> 01:07:26.265
We gotta do it right.

01:07:26.332 --> 01:07:28.468
We need to think about it, we
need to be smart, all right?

01:07:28.535 --> 01:07:30.470
Don't wanna fuck
it up like Michael.

01:07:30.537 --> 01:07:32.171
Well what the fuck
you want me to do?

01:07:32.238 --> 01:07:33.573
I want you to be calm.

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:34.574
What am I supposed to do?

01:07:34.641 --> 01:07:36.041
You have me sitting here,

01:07:36.108 --> 01:07:37.276
lookin' at the truck
that ran over my son.

01:07:37.343 --> 01:07:39.912
It's the process, yes.

01:07:39.979 --> 01:07:41.013
You're gonna get your day.

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:43.884
Don't worry, we'll be there.

01:07:43.949 --> 01:07:45.117
We're gonna set you up.

01:07:50.022 --> 01:07:51.991
It's gonna be smooth.

01:08:05.472 --> 01:08:07.374
I gotta give you
credit, Carrie.

01:08:10.877 --> 01:08:12.379
You are an amazing cook.

01:08:14.113 --> 01:08:15.347
Thank you, William.

01:08:16.348 --> 01:08:18.685
It's very nice to
have you here with us.

01:08:23.823 --> 01:08:25.256
How do you feel these days?

01:08:27.326 --> 01:08:29.127
The medications help.

01:08:31.162 --> 01:08:33.733
Mostly I try not
to think about it.

01:08:35.067 --> 01:08:38.505
So I spend time in the garden,

01:08:38.572 --> 01:08:40.206
I take long walks,

01:08:41.408 --> 01:08:46.345
and, well, Gordon has
been very busy with work.

01:08:47.078 --> 01:08:47.881
Isn't that right, honey?

01:08:47.948 --> 01:08:49.381
Yeah, busy days.

01:08:53.553 --> 01:08:55.087
Very busy.

01:08:55.154 --> 01:08:59.291
You're coping
much, much better.

01:09:02.929 --> 01:09:03.763
You know,

01:09:05.331 --> 01:09:08.000
I've got this big
condominium project

01:09:08.067 --> 01:09:10.169
that I'm drafting up right now.

01:09:12.037 --> 01:09:13.406
Isn't that right, babe?

01:09:14.573 --> 01:09:18.176
In fact, I need to have those
drafted by this evening,

01:09:18.243 --> 01:09:23.015
so if you don't mind,
I'm gonna hop up stairs

01:09:23.082 --> 01:09:24.518
and get to work on those,

01:09:24.584 --> 01:09:28.187
and I'll leave the two of
you to chat a little bit.

01:09:30.322 --> 01:09:33.058
Thank you for joining
us for dinner, doctor.

01:09:35.294 --> 01:09:37.162
Dinner was excellent, babe.

01:09:40.032 --> 01:09:41.200
Really great.

01:09:50.309 --> 01:09:51.578
I don't know what's
wrong with him.

01:09:51.645 --> 01:09:52.645
I'm sorry.

01:09:53.779 --> 01:09:56.148
I'm sorry for his
behavior, doctor, I don't.

01:09:57.082 --> 01:09:58.150
No, no, no, no.

01:10:00.052 --> 01:10:01.086
It's fine.

01:10:01.855 --> 01:10:06.359
Work puts his,

01:10:10.162 --> 01:10:11.230
puts his head,

01:10:14.133 --> 01:10:15.234
in another place.

01:10:31.183 --> 01:10:32.852
We need to know
his daily routine.

01:10:32.919 --> 01:10:34.921
What time he wakes up, what
time he leaves the house,

01:10:34.988 --> 01:10:37.991
when does he come back,
does he go to a bar,

01:10:38.058 --> 01:10:39.392
does he have any friends.

01:10:40.594 --> 01:10:42.062
How much beer he consumes?

01:10:42.127 --> 01:10:44.263
Gotta feed
the beer monster.

01:10:46.098 --> 01:10:48.068
Well, he's doing
plenty of that.

01:10:48.133 --> 01:10:49.803
I can't believe
he has friends.

01:10:51.705 --> 01:10:52.539
Shouldn't have.

01:11:00.981 --> 01:11:03.717
Know anyone that walks
like that?

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:15.127
He always carries his gun.

01:11:15.829 --> 01:11:16.696
Yeah, always.

01:11:18.732 --> 01:11:21.166
Yeah, he's gotta
be squeaky clean,

01:11:21.233 --> 01:11:23.168
'cause he's got prior arrests.

01:11:23.235 --> 01:11:25.071
He's gotta go by
the book, you know.

01:11:25.137 --> 01:11:30.275
If not, they're gonna
take his business.

01:11:30.877 --> 01:11:31.878
He loves that gun shop.

01:11:35.247 --> 01:11:36.616
There he is.

01:12:02.274 --> 01:12:04.243
Hey, see this?

01:12:05.177 --> 01:12:06.379
What's that?

01:12:07.614 --> 01:12:10.116
He doesn't keep his gun
on him when he drives.

01:12:10.182 --> 01:12:11.418
That's right.

01:12:11.484 --> 01:12:12.652
Keeps it on the
seat next to 'im.

01:12:17.857 --> 01:12:20.225
When is
he without that gun?

01:12:23.195 --> 01:12:24.864
When he goes to
the liquor store.

01:12:26.933 --> 01:12:28.300
That's right.

01:12:29.301 --> 01:12:30.370
Detective.

01:12:31.404 --> 01:12:33.373
Very good, detective.

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:37.242
That's when we'll get him.

01:12:37.309 --> 01:12:39.344
That's when we'll do it.

01:12:40.312 --> 01:12:42.916
We'll set him up at
the liquor store.

01:12:42.982 --> 01:12:43.783
That's it.

01:12:52.425 --> 01:12:54.627
Two packs, mad man.

01:12:57.464 --> 01:12:58.998
34.35, sir.

01:13:01.835 --> 01:13:02.969
Keep the change.

01:13:23.223 --> 01:13:25.425
'Scuse me, do
you have a light?

01:13:34.968 --> 01:13:36.236
Thanks.

01:13:36.301 --> 01:13:37.437
Yeah, get
your own, grandpa.

01:14:37.230 --> 01:14:38.765
My car just stopped.

01:14:50.143 --> 01:14:51.277
What's wrong, sugar?

01:14:51.343 --> 01:14:53.379
I don't know, it just stopped.

01:14:54.714 --> 01:14:58.618
This is my brother, he has
a chronic asthma condition.

01:14:58.685 --> 01:15:01.688
Okay, turn the key.

01:15:04.624 --> 01:15:07.627
Well, me and your brother
can push, all right?

01:15:07.694 --> 01:15:09.629
You just turn the key.

01:15:09.696 --> 01:15:11.698
Michael, get
out and help him okay?

01:15:13.499 --> 01:15:15.068
Come on, I got asthma too.

01:15:29.549 --> 01:15:31.184
Women drivers.

01:15:31.251 --> 01:15:33.953
Come on, help me push.

01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:38.024
All right, okay, you
opened the trunk, okay.

01:15:38.091 --> 01:15:40.159
Hello, look, listen.

01:15:40.226 --> 01:15:41.561
You just turn the key.

01:15:41.628 --> 01:15:43.229
You don't have to touch
any other buttons.

01:15:43.296 --> 01:15:44.163
Mm-hmm.

01:15:44.230 --> 01:15:45.064
Okay?

01:15:45.999 --> 01:15:47.000
You guys wanna push?

01:16:01.247 --> 01:16:02.916
Who's broken now?

01:16:04.484 --> 01:16:05.585
Car is coming.

01:16:05.652 --> 01:16:06.753
Go to the lake house with Gordon

01:16:06.819 --> 01:16:08.054
and we'll follow in Boyd's car.

01:17:02.241 --> 01:17:04.110
Get his
feet, get his feet.

01:17:06.546 --> 01:17:07.647
Ow, God dammit.

01:17:11.918 --> 01:17:12.952
Wait, I got him,
Gordon, I got him.

01:17:14.821 --> 01:17:19.192
Come on in here, you fuckin'
hit-and-run boy, huh?

01:17:26.132 --> 01:17:28.101
Hit-and-run boy, huh?

01:17:28.167 --> 01:17:29.769
Get him, get him.

01:17:32.638 --> 01:17:33.740
Tie him up.

01:17:33.806 --> 01:17:35.608
The god damned cow, tie him up.

01:17:37.343 --> 01:17:39.912
Rope him like a god-damned cat.

01:18:00.666 --> 01:18:02.568
How do you feel?

01:18:08.608 --> 01:18:09.642
I don't.

01:18:11.878 --> 01:18:13.179
When I lost Brian,

01:18:15.181 --> 01:18:19.685
I felt lonely,
scared, and worthless.

01:18:20.887 --> 01:18:23.089
The man that killed him
was out there somewhere.

01:18:26.626 --> 01:18:28.227
I locked myself in my apartment.

01:18:32.098 --> 01:18:33.833
At some point, I thought I
was working up the courage

01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:35.134
to take my own life.

01:18:37.336 --> 01:18:39.739
Then Dr. Hobson gave
me a second chance.

01:18:40.907 --> 01:18:42.742
Now I feel a part of this group.

01:18:45.244 --> 01:18:46.712
This family.

01:18:50.817 --> 01:18:52.553
I feel strong again.

01:19:39.966 --> 01:19:41.901
I didn't lose my pain.

01:19:44.538 --> 01:19:45.805
That would be impossible.

01:19:48.641 --> 01:19:50.477
But I took my husband's revenge

01:19:50.544 --> 01:19:53.146
on a man that didn't
mean shit in this world.

01:19:56.015 --> 01:19:57.917
The world is full of evil.

01:20:01.921 --> 01:20:04.824
They say that once you
have hatred in your heart,

01:20:05.691 --> 01:20:06.692
it stays with you.

01:20:06.759 --> 01:20:08.362
It never goes away.

01:20:10.663 --> 01:20:11.831
It's true.

01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:15.268
Now when I wake
up in the morning

01:20:15.334 --> 01:20:19.373
and read the newspaper
or watch the news,

01:20:21.274 --> 01:20:22.409
all I feel is hate.

01:20:25.711 --> 01:20:27.079
It's who I am now.

01:20:28.848 --> 01:20:29.916
Am I proud of it?

01:20:34.555 --> 01:20:35.755
I don't know yet.

01:20:38.659 --> 01:20:39.759
It's hard to tell.

01:20:49.636 --> 01:20:51.070
You're a good friend, Gordon.

01:21:00.012 --> 01:21:01.981
That sucks what
they did to your son,

01:21:02.048 --> 01:21:03.783
that son of a bitch.

01:21:05.785 --> 01:21:08.788
You know, soldiers,
and war, and battle,

01:21:08.854 --> 01:21:11.023
it's kill or be killed, right?

01:21:12.559 --> 01:21:16.095
They do it for money or
the glory or their country.

01:21:17.129 --> 01:21:18.699
You know what they
really do it for,

01:21:18.764 --> 01:21:21.468
is that son of a bitch
fighting right alongside him.

01:21:21.535 --> 01:21:23.503
That's a good reason to kill.

01:21:25.071 --> 01:21:29.775
People fight, people
kill, for no reason.

01:21:31.378 --> 01:21:34.013
I'm not a killer,
not a vigilante.

01:21:35.649 --> 01:21:40.186
I'm just trying to make
it right, that's it.

01:21:41.622 --> 01:21:44.424
And that was wrong what
he did to your son.

01:21:50.997 --> 01:21:53.299
The world is a war-zone,

01:21:54.401 --> 01:21:55.835
but you never know it

01:21:55.901 --> 01:21:58.271
until it jumps up and
bites you on the ass.

01:21:59.005 --> 01:22:00.239
You know what I mean?

01:22:02.908 --> 01:22:04.877
Yeah, I think I do.

01:22:15.422 --> 01:22:17.524
Do you
know why you're here?

01:22:19.292 --> 01:22:20.427
No.

01:22:30.136 --> 01:22:32.204
The fuck is this, man?

01:22:32.271 --> 01:22:33.272
Who is that?

01:22:34.807 --> 01:22:36.342
That's my son.

01:22:37.043 --> 01:22:38.478
My 16-year-old son.

01:22:40.846 --> 01:22:42.348
You hit him with your car,

01:22:44.384 --> 01:22:47.820
and you left, you drove away
and left him in the road.

01:22:48.988 --> 01:22:50.457
You didn't call for help,

01:22:51.924 --> 01:22:53.460
you didn't take him
to the hospital.

01:22:54.827 --> 01:22:56.829
If you had, he might have lived.

01:22:57.731 --> 01:22:58.931
Look, man.

01:22:59.865 --> 01:23:01.867
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:23:02.935 --> 01:23:03.936
I think that you do.

01:23:05.639 --> 01:23:07.073
Do not lie to me.

01:23:11.712 --> 01:23:13.913
Confess to what you've done.

01:23:13.979 --> 01:23:16.115
Call the cops then, man.

01:23:16.182 --> 01:23:18.485
I'll have my day in
court, motherfucker.

01:23:18.552 --> 01:23:20.186
Wait 'til I get out.

01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:24.424
What the hell is
the matter with you?

01:23:28.961 --> 01:23:30.397
Do not lie to me.

01:23:32.599 --> 01:23:33.933
Confess.

01:23:33.999 --> 01:23:36.603
Confess to what you've done.

01:23:36.670 --> 01:23:39.473
Police, police, police!

01:23:40.906 --> 01:23:41.941
Help!

01:23:43.008 --> 01:23:44.310
No one can hear you.

01:23:47.414 --> 01:23:50.784
What do
you wanna hear, man?

01:23:50.851 --> 01:23:52.619
I wanna hear the truth.

01:23:52.686 --> 01:23:55.054
I want you to tell me the truth.

01:23:56.623 --> 01:23:57.890
Tell me what you did.

01:24:00.527 --> 01:24:01.361
Confess.

01:24:09.469 --> 01:24:10.302
I was drunk.

01:24:17.644 --> 01:24:19.413
I didn't see the light.

01:24:24.083 --> 01:24:26.420
It happened so fast.

01:24:30.690 --> 01:24:32.526
He went over the car,

01:24:32.592 --> 01:24:37.096
and I turned around, and
I thought he was dead.

01:24:45.672 --> 01:24:46.573
I didn't stop.

01:24:50.677 --> 01:24:51.912
I kept going.

01:24:59.318 --> 01:25:01.922
Please don't kill me.

01:25:01.987 --> 01:25:04.990
Please don't kill me.

01:25:05.057 --> 01:25:07.026
Please don't kill me.

01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:09.563
I have a son.

01:25:10.464 --> 01:25:11.731
I have a son.

01:25:12.833 --> 01:25:14.501
I have a son and a wife.

01:25:15.836 --> 01:25:17.002
I have a picture of him.

01:25:17.069 --> 01:25:17.970
You can look at my wallet.

01:25:18.037 --> 01:25:19.138
I'm not lying.

01:25:22.576 --> 01:25:23.410
I swear.

01:25:24.377 --> 01:25:25.211
Look.

01:25:26.646 --> 01:25:27.481
Look.

01:25:28.882 --> 01:25:33.553
I have a son.

01:25:48.835 --> 01:25:49.669
Where?

01:25:53.305 --> 01:25:56.776
That's Tommy.

01:25:56.843 --> 01:25:59.913
And that's Angie next to him.

01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:02.582
She doesn't talk to me anymore.

01:26:06.118 --> 01:26:08.187
I want to see them again.

01:26:10.557 --> 01:26:13.727
Gordon, what the fuck
are you doing, man?

01:26:13.793 --> 01:26:14.761
You outta your mind?

01:26:14.828 --> 01:26:16.061
This guy's in your head.

01:26:16.128 --> 01:26:17.263
What are you think' of?

01:26:17.329 --> 01:26:19.031
He wants to see his son, huh?

01:26:19.098 --> 01:26:20.700
He wants to see his son?

01:26:20.767 --> 01:26:21.968
You wanna see yours?

01:26:22.034 --> 01:26:23.102
Huh, how 'bout that?

01:26:23.168 --> 01:26:24.971
Let's go over to the cemetery,

01:26:25.037 --> 01:26:27.106
and dig his ass up
and see how he looks.

01:26:27.172 --> 01:26:28.708
And see what the fuck

01:26:28.775 --> 01:26:29.676
- he's talkin' about.
- Don't talk to me like that.

01:26:30.844 --> 01:26:32.211
Man up, man.

01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:36.383
Let's calm down, okay?

01:26:37.082 --> 01:26:39.184
Do not listen to him.

01:26:39.251 --> 01:26:42.022
Don't let him get
into your head.

01:26:42.087 --> 01:26:43.990
He is a murderer.

01:26:44.056 --> 01:26:48.028
Gerald Boyd killed
your son, David.

01:26:48.093 --> 01:26:49.261
End of story.

01:26:50.195 --> 01:26:51.230
Period.

01:26:54.066 --> 01:26:55.200
You've got to do it man.

01:26:55.267 --> 01:26:56.302
- I can't.
- It's gonna be

01:26:56.369 --> 01:26:58.004
the rest of your life, man.

01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:59.005
- Gordon, end it.
- Look, doc'.

01:26:59.071 --> 01:27:00.540
God dammit.

01:27:00.607 --> 01:27:01.441
Gordon.

01:27:03.443 --> 01:27:04.511
Oh, I'm gonna
take him out, doc'.

01:27:04.578 --> 01:27:05.879
I'm gonna take this one out,

01:27:05.946 --> 01:27:07.346
and then I'm gonna take him out.

01:27:07.414 --> 01:27:08.748
- No, no, no.
- I'm gonna end this, doc'.

01:27:08.815 --> 01:27:10.082
Don't do something stupid.

01:27:10.149 --> 01:27:11.017
Don't do something stupid.

01:27:11.083 --> 01:27:12.284
Let me go.

01:27:13.787 --> 01:27:14.621
Fuck.

01:27:15.555 --> 01:27:16.389
Fuck.

01:27:36.141 --> 01:27:38.612
Gordon, Gordon.

01:27:38.678 --> 01:27:39.479
Stupid fuck.

01:27:39.546 --> 01:27:41.581
You gotta finish the job.

01:27:47.654 --> 01:27:48.287
Gordon.

01:27:48.355 --> 01:27:50.122
Oh, God baby.

01:27:50.189 --> 01:27:51.156
Oh my God.

01:27:51.223 --> 01:27:52.792
Where have you been?

01:27:52.859 --> 01:27:54.461
- I've been calling you.
- He was right in front of me.

01:27:54.527 --> 01:27:55.895
I had him, I had him
right in front of me.

01:27:55.962 --> 01:27:56.963
I couldn't do it, I
was gonna kill him.

01:27:57.030 --> 01:27:58.498
I couldn't do him.

01:27:58.565 --> 01:27:59.699
Oh my God, he was right
there in front of me, too.

01:27:59.766 --> 01:28:00.834
He begged for his life.

01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:01.801
Who?

01:28:01.868 --> 01:28:04.404
Who was begging?

01:28:04.471 --> 01:28:05.705
Who?

01:28:05.772 --> 01:28:06.640
Who was lying?

01:28:06.706 --> 01:28:07.641
What are you,

01:28:07.707 --> 01:28:08.708
- what are you saying?
- The guy.

01:28:08.775 --> 01:28:09.509
Baby, the man.

01:28:10.877 --> 01:28:11.978
The man.

01:28:12.045 --> 01:28:14.114
- The man who.
- What man?

01:28:14.179 --> 01:28:17.550
The man, I found him.

01:28:17.617 --> 01:28:20.219
The man, it was the man who
killed him, it was the man.

01:28:20.285 --> 01:28:21.554
Whose car is that?

01:28:21.621 --> 01:28:23.923
Whose care is that, Gordon?

01:28:25.324 --> 01:28:27.527
Baby, that's the
car that killed David.

01:28:30.797 --> 01:28:31.931
That's the car, and
I found the man,

01:28:31.998 --> 01:28:33.433
and I was gonna kill him,

01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:34.434
but he was begging for his
life right in front of me

01:28:34.501 --> 01:28:36.268
and I could not do it.

01:28:43.476 --> 01:28:46.579
I couldn't, baby,
I couldn't do it.

01:28:50.850 --> 01:28:51.685
Honey.

01:28:53.285 --> 01:28:54.319
Carrie.

01:30:36.356 --> 01:30:38.458
I wanna do this alone.

01:31:05.218 --> 01:31:08.521
Are you the driver
who killed my son?

01:31:14.227 --> 01:31:15.528
Yeah.

01:31:18.131 --> 01:31:19.766
Why did you leave?

01:31:21.968 --> 01:31:23.335
Why did you run?

01:31:24.504 --> 01:31:26.072
I didn't know what to do.

01:31:27.874 --> 01:31:29.108
I wasn't thinking.

01:31:31.978 --> 01:31:32.879
I panicked.

01:31:35.315 --> 01:31:37.116
Does your husband beat you?

01:31:48.494 --> 01:31:51.831
My husband is a good man.

01:31:53.900 --> 01:31:56.135
I'm sure he is.

01:31:56.202 --> 01:31:58.805
I'm sure he is such a good guy.

01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:04.611
You could convince
him to let me go.

01:32:06.346 --> 01:32:07.914
I won't say a word.

01:32:09.749 --> 01:32:13.653
I'll even overlook how he
broke my jaw.

01:32:19.192 --> 01:32:20.059
He might.

01:32:22.562 --> 01:32:23.696
But I won't.

01:32:40.947 --> 01:32:41.948
Carrie, Carrie.

01:32:42.015 --> 01:32:44.584
First
aid, first aid.

01:33:27.627 --> 01:33:30.630
Come on, come on, Gerald Boyd.

01:33:34.534 --> 01:33:36.102
Stop.

01:33:36.169 --> 01:33:37.003
Hold it.

01:33:41.274 --> 01:33:42.642
All right, guys.

01:33:43.843 --> 01:33:44.445
That's it.

01:33:51.418 --> 01:33:53.319
God dammit.

01:33:54.455 --> 01:33:55.655
That's enough.

01:34:01.861 --> 01:34:02.662
Carrie.

01:34:13.374 --> 01:34:14.540
Carrie.

01:34:14.607 --> 01:34:15.675
Carrie.

01:34:17.143 --> 01:34:19.645
She's in the
cabin with William.

01:34:24.584 --> 01:34:25.618
Carrie.

01:34:30.123 --> 01:34:30.957
Carrie.

01:34:33.259 --> 01:34:34.461
Carrie.

01:34:34.527 --> 01:34:35.695
Baby.

01:34:36.430 --> 01:34:37.263
Hey.

01:34:38.297 --> 01:34:39.699
Baby, I thought I lost you.

01:34:41.734 --> 01:34:43.504
Are you okay?

01:34:43.569 --> 01:34:44.405
Hey.

01:34:44.471 --> 01:34:45.571
She's okay.

01:34:45.638 --> 01:34:47.306
She's gonna need some treatment.

01:34:47.374 --> 01:34:48.174
She needs to be quiet.

01:34:48.241 --> 01:34:49.042
What is it?

01:34:49.909 --> 01:34:50.877
What is it, what
happened to her?

01:34:50.943 --> 01:34:52.145
Keep pressure on this.

01:34:52.211 --> 01:34:53.713
You need to keep
pressure on that.

01:34:54.647 --> 01:34:55.681
All right?

01:34:56.616 --> 01:34:57.550
I'm gonna leave you
two alone, okay?

01:34:57.617 --> 01:34:58.251
Yeah, yeah, okay.

01:35:00.887 --> 01:35:01.721
Hey.

01:35:05.925 --> 01:35:06.759
Hey.

01:35:13.733 --> 01:35:14.834
Did he get away?

01:35:19.305 --> 01:35:20.106
No.

01:35:26.413 --> 01:35:27.246
No, he didn't.

01:35:47.633 --> 01:35:48.835
Here you go.

01:35:51.137 --> 01:35:53.039
I'll take Carrie
to the hospital,

01:35:53.106 --> 01:35:54.674
just to make sure she's okay.

01:35:54.740 --> 01:35:55.708
What?

01:35:55.775 --> 01:35:56.776
I'm going with you.

01:35:58.579 --> 01:36:00.980
I want to be with her.

01:36:01.047 --> 01:36:02.815
I'll see you tomorrow, Gordon.

01:36:02.882 --> 01:36:04.650
No, you won't.

01:36:04.717 --> 01:36:06.052
You won't be seeing me again.

01:36:06.119 --> 01:36:07.454
That's it for me.

01:36:07.521 --> 01:36:09.622
We are going somewhere
very far away from here,

01:36:09.689 --> 01:36:11.624
and we are starting over.

01:36:11.691 --> 01:36:13.092
I wanna be with my wife.

01:36:15.362 --> 01:36:16.195
Okay.

01:36:17.364 --> 01:36:21.701
But I need you to do
one last thing for us.

01:36:21.767 --> 01:36:23.269
Boyd's almost done.

01:36:28.774 --> 01:36:29.809
Yeah.

01:36:32.178 --> 01:36:33.547
You.

01:36:33.614 --> 01:36:34.647
Come on.

01:37:25.698 --> 01:37:26.866
He was a good man.

01:37:28.334 --> 01:37:29.268
He became a man.

01:37:29.335 --> 01:37:30.169
I saw him.

01:37:34.541 --> 01:37:36.275
Live by the sword, you die.

01:37:37.578 --> 01:37:38.978
You die by the sword.

01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:43.849
Oh yeah, and he did.

01:37:45.851 --> 01:37:49.188
Now, we're gonna take care
of some business here.

01:37:50.189 --> 01:37:52.158
We're gonna start right here.

01:37:52.225 --> 01:37:56.062
Right there, 'cause the
ankles are the hardest ones.

01:37:56.128 --> 01:37:58.498
We're gonna start
with the ankles first.

01:37:58.565 --> 01:37:59.765
You gotta start there.

01:37:59.832 --> 01:38:01.300
- Wait a second.
- Then we're gonna

01:38:01.368 --> 01:38:02.735
- take him off here, right here.
- Wait a second.

01:38:02.802 --> 01:38:03.936
Antonio, what are
you talking about?

01:38:04.003 --> 01:38:06.172
What am I talking about?

01:38:06.239 --> 01:38:10.042
I'm talking about
you, helping me,

01:38:10.109 --> 01:38:12.078
to clean this mess up.

01:38:12.144 --> 01:38:13.346
That's what I'm talkin' about.

01:38:13.413 --> 01:38:14.213
This mess?

01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:15.348
Yeah.

01:38:15.415 --> 01:38:16.683
What exactly is it
you want me to do.

01:38:16.749 --> 01:38:18.585
I'm trying to tell you that.

01:38:18.652 --> 01:38:22.021
You killed a man today, Gordon.

01:38:22.088 --> 01:38:23.322
Do you remember that?

01:38:25.157 --> 01:38:27.760
Who cleaned that mess up, hmm?

01:38:27.827 --> 01:38:28.761
I did.

01:38:28.828 --> 01:38:29.795
I did it.

01:38:29.862 --> 01:38:31.097
I cleaned up your mess.

01:38:31.163 --> 01:38:35.034
You are gonna help
me with this mess.

01:38:35.101 --> 01:38:37.937
Like I said, then
we'll get to the head.

01:38:38.004 --> 01:38:39.839
Get up to here,
gonna take that off.

01:38:39.905 --> 01:38:41.642
You're gonna lop the arms off,

01:38:41.708 --> 01:38:43.009
and we're gonna put him in a bag

01:38:43.075 --> 01:38:44.777
and put him in the river.

01:38:44.844 --> 01:38:46.312
That's what we're doing here.

01:38:47.681 --> 01:38:50.883
I know you probably wanna
go off to the little wify

01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:53.853
and go to never-never land
and forget about all this.

01:38:53.919 --> 01:38:55.187
Is that true?

01:38:55.254 --> 01:38:57.457
Yeah, that's
what's gonna happen.

01:38:57.524 --> 01:38:59.559
Yeah, I think
that's a good thing.

01:39:00.661 --> 01:39:04.063
But you got some unfinished
business with me,

01:39:04.930 --> 01:39:05.965
and with Michael.

01:39:06.866 --> 01:39:08.968
We're not leaving
him here like this.

01:39:10.002 --> 01:39:13.072
So I want you to man up.

01:39:31.190 --> 01:39:31.991
Mary...

01:39:33.926 --> 01:39:34.960
Mary Dawson?

01:39:42.569 --> 01:39:44.170
I'm Dr. William Hobson,

01:39:45.938 --> 01:39:47.541
the head psychiatrist.

01:39:50.777 --> 01:39:52.144
I heard about your husband,

01:39:55.314 --> 01:39:57.384
and I'm very sorry
for your loss.

01:40:00.019 --> 01:40:01.320
Thank you, doctor.

01:40:04.758 --> 01:40:06.593
Do you wanna talk about it?

01:40:08.961 --> 01:40:10.029
Yeah.

01:40:10.996 --> 01:40:12.031
Sure.

01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:15.034
I know it's not easy.

01:40:16.268 --> 01:40:17.103
I know.

01:40:19.038 --> 01:40:21.541
I just, I can feel it.

01:40:21.608 --> 01:40:22.442
It hurts.
