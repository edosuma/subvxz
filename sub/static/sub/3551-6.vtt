WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.103
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.103 --> 00:04.135
BREE'S ROMANCE WARMED UP.

00:04.135 --> 00:05.776
OH, MY.

00:05.776 --> 00:08.679
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO
GIVE GRACE EXPENSIVE GIFTS.

00:08.679 --> 00:10.681
GABY GREW CLOSER
TO HER BIOLOGICAL DAUGHTER.

00:10.681 --> 00:13.744
I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.
YOU DESERVE BEAUTIFUL THINGS.

00:13.744 --> 00:15.746
LYNETTE FINALLY GOT A NANNY.

00:15.746 --> 00:17.418
TOMMY!

00:17.418 --> 00:20.191
MOM!
 BUT THERE WAS A CATCH.

00:20.191 --> 00:23.054
SUSAN ADDED
TO HER TEACHING INCOME--

00:23.054 --> 00:26.097
A SECRET JOB
THAT MADE HER VULNERABLE...

00:26.097 --> 00:28.059
OH! OH!
 It would be unfortunate

00:28.059 --> 00:30.461
if anyone were to find out
what I already know.

00:30.461 --> 00:31.662
TO BLACKMAIL.

00:31.662 --> 00:33.664
Imagine what your husband
would think.

00:40.040 --> 00:44.245
(Mary Alice) PAUL YOUNG
WAS A FRUSTRATED MAN.

00:44.245 --> 00:47.578
HE'D BEEN LIVING WITH HIS WIFE
FOR OVER TWO MONTHS,

00:47.578 --> 00:52.183
BUT SHE STILL REFUSED
TO SLEEP WITH HIM.

00:52.183 --> 00:55.426
HE TRIED EVERYTHING
HE COULD THINK OF

00:55.426 --> 00:58.359
TO PUT HER IN THE MOOD--

00:58.359 --> 01:01.592
EXPENSIVE JEWELRY...

01:01.592 --> 01:05.766
SECOND GLASSES OF WINE...

01:05.766 --> 01:10.201
INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS.

01:10.201 --> 01:11.502
BUT SADLY,

01:11.502 --> 01:15.476
HIS WIFE'S RESPONSE
WAS NEVER WHAT HE'D HOPED FOR.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.111
SO PAUL DECIDED TO GET HELP

01:20.111 --> 01:25.116
FROM SOMEONE SURE TO SYMPATHIZE
WITH HIS SITUATION...

01:25.116 --> 01:27.258
HI. I'M DR. GABLE.

01:27.258 --> 01:29.390
ANOTHER MAN.

01:29.390 --> 01:31.562
SHOULD WE GET THIS SESSION
STARTED?

01:33.564 --> 01:36.127
SO... WHEN YOU MARRIED PAUL,

01:36.127 --> 01:39.570
IT DIDN'T OCCUR TO YOU HE MIGHT
BE RELEASED FROM PRISON SOMEDAY?

01:39.570 --> 01:41.472
NOT REALLY.

01:41.472 --> 01:43.804
SO YOU WERE CONTENT
TO MARRY A MAN

01:43.804 --> 01:46.637
YOU COULD NEVER TRULY BE WITH?

01:46.637 --> 01:49.710
I JUST WANTED SOMEONE
TO CARE ABOUT ME.

01:49.710 --> 01:53.214
I-I WASN'T REALLY INTERESTED
IN ALL THAT OTHER S-STUFF.

01:53.214 --> 01:55.146
"STUFF"?

01:55.146 --> 01:56.587
MEANING SEX?

01:59.190 --> 02:02.122
DO YOU NOT LIKE SEX?

02:02.122 --> 02:06.126
I'M NOT... SURE EXACTLY.

02:07.598 --> 02:09.330
I'M A VIRGIN.

02:09.330 --> 02:12.333
OH, COME ON!

02:12.333 --> 02:15.306
IT'S TRUE.
 YOU'RE 30 YEARS OLD!

02:15.306 --> 02:17.908
I WAS SAVING MYSELF
FOR MARRIAGE.
 GOOD NEWS. YOU ARE MARRIED.

02:17.908 --> 02:20.641
TIME TO TAKE THE LID
OFF THE COOKIE JAR.

02:20.641 --> 02:23.714
STOP CALLING IT THAT.
 GIVE ME A COOKIE,
AND I WILL!

02:23.714 --> 02:26.146
OKAY, OKAY,
LET'S TAKE A STEP BACK HERE.

02:26.146 --> 02:29.380
THIS IS CLEARLY
AN UNUSUAL SITUATION.

02:29.380 --> 02:31.882
THE TWO OF YOU...
NEVER GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER

02:31.882 --> 02:34.385
IN ANY TRADITIONAL SENSE.

02:34.385 --> 02:36.487
MY SUGGESTION?

02:36.487 --> 02:37.828
START DATING.

02:37.828 --> 02:40.791
YOU WANT ME TO DATE MY WIFE?

02:40.791 --> 02:44.395
YES. COURT HER. TAKE BETH OUT
TO SOME NICE RESTAURANTS.

02:44.395 --> 02:46.337
GIVE HER A CHANCE TO KNOW YOU

02:46.337 --> 02:48.299
SO SHE CAN DEVELOP
NORMAL ROMANTIC FEELINGS.

02:48.299 --> 02:50.301
IN TIME, I'M SURE
SHE'LL WANT NOTHING MORE

02:50.301 --> 02:52.843
THAN TO SHARE YOUR BED.

02:52.843 --> 02:56.477
I WOULDN'T MIND GOING
TO SOME NICE RESTAURANTS.

02:59.410 --> 03:01.512
FINE.

03:01.512 --> 03:04.555
YES, PAUL YOUNG WAS FRUSTRATED.

03:04.555 --> 03:06.687
BUT EVEN FRUSTRATED MEN...

03:06.687 --> 03:09.790
F.Y.I.,
UNTIL I GET SOME ACTION,

03:09.790 --> 03:12.223
IT'LL BE DUTCH TREAT.

03:12.223 --> 03:25.976
HAVE THEIR PRIDE.

03:25.976 --> 03:29.840
IT WAS THAT TIME OF YEAR
WHEN PEOPLE FIND OUT

03:29.840 --> 03:31.982
WHAT THEY'RE AFRAID OF.

03:35.246 --> 03:39.920
FOR SOME, IT'S THE MONSTER
IN THE BUSHES.

03:39.920 --> 03:43.754
FOR OTHERS, IT'S THE SPIDER
IN THEIR HAIR.

03:43.754 --> 03:45.726
♪♪♪

03:45.726 --> 03:50.601
FOR A FEW, IT'S THE VAMPIRE
IN THE DRIVEWAY.

03:50.601 --> 03:56.467
YES, HALLOWEEN HAD ONCE AGAIN
COME TO WISTERIA LANE.

03:56.467 --> 04:00.271
AND THE ONLY THING
THAT FRIGHTENED ONE WOMAN

04:00.271 --> 04:03.944
WAS THAT SHE MIGHT NOT BE
THE CENTER OF ATTENTION.

04:03.944 --> 04:06.647
I'M HAVING A PARTY,
AND YOU ALL HAVE TO COME.

04:06.647 --> 04:09.450
DID YOU KNOCK?

04:09.450 --> 04:12.723
DOUG AND I HAD HALLOWEEN PARTIES
EVERY YEAR IN NEW YORK,

04:12.723 --> 04:15.356
AND I FIGURED JUST BECAUSE
I'M IN FAIRVIEW NOW,

04:15.356 --> 04:17.528
DOESN'T MEAN I CAN'T CARRY ON
THE TRADITION...

04:17.528 --> 04:19.529
EVEN THOUGH
THE FOOD'S NOT AS GOOD

04:19.529 --> 04:22.393
AND THE COMPANY IS... (sighs)
FAR LESS INTERESTING.

04:22.393 --> 04:25.496
WELL, WHO CAN TURN DOWN
AN INVITATION LIKE THAT?

04:25.496 --> 04:28.339
WELL, GRACE IS SLEEPING OVER
THAT NIGHT,

04:28.339 --> 04:30.341
BUT WE CAN SWING BY AFTER
WE'RE DONE TRICK-OR-TREATING

04:30.341 --> 04:32.773
AND SHOW YOU THEIR COSTUMES.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.706
JUANITA'S GOING AS A PUPPY THIS
YEAR. SHE'S GONNA LOOK SO CUTE.

04:35.706 --> 04:37.678
YEAH, SEE THIS?

04:37.678 --> 04:39.980
THE TRICYCLE WITH A LINE
THROUGH IT? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

04:39.980 --> 04:41.312
NO KIDS.

04:41.312 --> 04:43.654
THEY ALWAYS GET UNDERFOOT,
THEY EAT ALL THE CANDY,

04:43.654 --> 04:46.717
AND, UH, YOU CAN'T SWEAR
IN FRONT OF THE LITTLE BASTARDS.

04:46.717 --> 04:49.360
WELL, I'LL COME
IF I CAN BRING KEITH.

04:49.360 --> 04:53.023
I GUESS ONE CHILD WILL BE OKAY.

04:53.023 --> 04:55.896
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
LYNETTE?

04:55.896 --> 04:57.067
YEAH?

04:57.067 --> 04:58.969
DID YOU BUY ME
MY CHINA PEARL HAND CREAM?

04:58.969 --> 05:01.031
I DON'T REMEMBER
YOU ASKING ME TO.

05:01.031 --> 05:03.974
BUT I GUESS I COULD GO
AFTER WE'RE DONE EATING.

05:03.974 --> 05:06.036
OH, ALL RIGHT. IT'S JUST
THAT MY HANDS ARE SO DRY.

05:06.036 --> 05:09.440
THEY'RE STARTING TO CRACK
AND BLEED.

05:09.440 --> 05:13.644
UH... OKAY. I'LL GO NOW.
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

05:13.644 --> 05:16.316
JUST MAKE SURE THAT
YOU WAKE UP PAIGE AT 3:00,

05:16.316 --> 05:18.989
'CAUSE IF SHE SLEEPS ANY LONGER,
SHE'LL BE UP ALL NIGHT.

05:18.989 --> 05:21.792
ALL RIGHT, DEAR.
 OKAY.

05:21.792 --> 05:23.354
OH!

05:23.354 --> 05:24.525
(singsongy) A PARTY!

05:24.525 --> 05:26.026
(scoffs) NO.

05:30.931 --> 05:33.864
AS WEB SITES GO,
IT'S NOT THAT POPULAR...

05:33.864 --> 05:37.007
JUST IN ASIA
AND PARTS OF EUROPE.

05:38.709 --> 05:41.011
AND YOU CAN SEE
THAT THERE'S NO NUDITY.

05:41.011 --> 05:44.515
I WAS JUST CLEANING...
IN MY UNDERWEAR.

05:46.947 --> 05:49.720
OH, LOOK, MIKE.
I KNOW THAT YOU MUST BE ANGRY.

05:49.720 --> 05:53.784
I-IF YOU WANNA YELL, YELL.
LET ME HAVE IT.

05:53.784 --> 05:55.926
SAY SOMETHING, PLEASE?

05:55.926 --> 05:59.490
I SHOULD'VE TAKEN
THAT JOB IN ALASKA.

05:59.490 --> 06:01.031
WHAT?

06:01.031 --> 06:03.033
IF I DID A BETTER JOB
TAKING CARE OF THIS FAMILY,

06:03.033 --> 06:05.035
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE HAD
TO RESORT TO THIS.

06:05.035 --> 06:08.038
NO, NO! THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT!
IT WAS MY STUPID MISTAKE.

06:08.038 --> 06:11.872
I THOUGHT I COULD MAKE SOME EASY
MONEY AND NO ONE WOULD KNOW.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.544
I'M SO SORRY.

06:13.544 --> 06:16.607
WHY'D YOU DECIDE TO TELL ME?
DID SOMEBODY SEE YOU?

06:17.948 --> 06:19.980
PAUL YOUNG.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.111
OH, GOD.

06:21.111 --> 06:23.914
AND HE'S...
SORT OF BLACKMAILING ME.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.958
HE SAID THAT IF WE DON'T
SELL HIM OUR HOUSE,

06:27.958 --> 06:30.921
HE WAS GONNA TELL YOU.

06:30.921 --> 06:34.024
BUT I TOLD YOU,
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER.

06:34.024 --> 06:35.996
AND W-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:35.996 --> 06:37.998
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

06:37.998 --> 06:40.000
NO, NO, NO! DON'T BE ANGRY.
THIS WAS GOOD.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.002
I'M NOT LYING TO YOU NOW.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.934
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
PAUL DID US A FAVOR.

06:43.934 --> 06:46.006
LOOK! NO! NO!

06:46.006 --> 06:48.579
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK!
WE'RE CLOSER THAN EVER.

06:48.579 --> 06:50.911
SUSAN, GET OFF ME.
 VIOLENCE ISN'T THE ANSWER.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.983
WE CAN'T LET HIM
GET AWAY WITH THIS.

06:52.983 --> 06:56.817
WE WON'T. I HAVE AN IDEA
HOW TO GET HIM TO BACK OFF.

06:58.849 --> 07:01.692
I'M LISTENING.

07:04.054 --> 07:06.196
I CAN'T WAIT TO GO
TRICK-OR-TREATING WITH YOU.

07:06.196 --> 07:08.198
THIS IS WHAT I'M GONNA USE
TO HOLD ALL MY CANDY.

07:08.198 --> 07:10.961
UH, THAT'S NOT GOING TO CUT IT
IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD.

07:10.961 --> 07:12.933
LAST YEAR, I FILLED UP
TWO PILLOWCASES.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.466
WOW.
 (sets down pumpkin)

07:19.169 --> 07:21.041
WHERE'D YOU GET THIS?

07:21.041 --> 07:23.073
WHY?

07:23.073 --> 07:25.115
THIS IS MY MOM'S.

07:25.115 --> 07:26.817
NO, IT'S NOT.

07:26.817 --> 07:29.550
THIS WAS A GIFT...
FROM MY AUNT.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.722
OH.

07:31.722 --> 07:33.083
OKAY.

07:33.083 --> 07:35.726
GIRLS, COME ON.
MRS. SOLIS IS HERE.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.095
HI, SWEETIE.

07:45.095 --> 07:47.137
YOU AND GRACE
HAVE A GOOD TIME?

07:47.137 --> 07:48.999
IT WAS OKAY.

07:48.999 --> 07:52.072
WHAT ARE YOU SMILING ABOUT?

07:52.072 --> 07:55.576
I FOUND OUT SOMETHING
ABOUT GRACE TODAY.

07:55.576 --> 07:57.878
SHE'S A THIEF.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.479
WHAT...

07:59.479 --> 08:01.552
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT?

08:01.552 --> 08:04.685
SHE STOLE YOUR NECKLACE,
SO I STOLE IT BACK.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.156
NO! NO! NO!

08:06.156 --> 08:07.958
I...

08:07.958 --> 08:10.561
I MEAN...
THAT'S VERY SWEET OF YOU,

08:10.561 --> 08:14.064
BUT GRACE DIDN'T STEAL THIS.
I GAVE IT TO HER AS A PRESENT.

08:14.064 --> 08:15.566
WHY?

08:15.566 --> 08:19.499
BECAUSE... I FELT SORRY
FOR HER.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.873
YOU KNOW, HER FAMILY IS POOR,
AND WE HAVE SO MUCH.

08:22.873 --> 08:25.676
AUNT ROSIE'S POOR, AND YOU
ALWAYS HIDE YOUR JEWELRY BOX

08:25.676 --> 08:27.137
WHEN SHE COMES OVER.

08:27.137 --> 08:30.981
YEAH, WELL, GRACE ISN'T
A KLEPTO WITH A METH HABIT.

08:30.981 --> 08:33.914
SO DO YOU WANT ME
TO GIVE IT BACK?

08:33.914 --> 08:37.988
(sighs) NO.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

08:37.988 --> 08:39.820
(engine starts)

08:39.820 --> 08:42.823
BUT NOW THAT I KNOW YOU'RE GOOD
AT GETTING THINGS BACK,

08:42.823 --> 08:46.827
NEXT TIME WE'RE AT AUNT ROSIE'S,
I'M MISSING GOLD EARRINGS.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.829
(door opens)

08:50.200 --> 08:52.202
(door closes)
 AH! HERE YOU GO.

08:52.202 --> 08:54.635
YOUR CHINA PEARL HAND CREAM.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.807
THANK YOU, DEAR.
I JUST USED MY LAST JAR.

08:56.807 --> 08:58.538
YOU'RE WELCOME.
 (keys clatter)

08:58.538 --> 09:01.642
SO HOW DID IT GO
WITH THE BABY?

09:01.642 --> 09:04.144
AND ON A RELATED NOTE,
WHERE IS THE BABY?

09:04.144 --> 09:05.616
UPSTAIRS IN THE CRIB.

09:05.616 --> 09:07.618
OH. WHAT?!

09:07.618 --> 09:09.219
SHE'S STILL ASLEEP?

09:09.219 --> 09:11.221
YES, BLESS HER HEART.

09:11.221 --> 09:14.885
I HAD TIME TO MEND
ALL OF RODNEY'S OLD SWEATERS.

09:14.885 --> 09:16.186
TOM'S SWEATERS,

09:16.186 --> 09:19.289
AND I ASKED YOU, AND YOU SAID
YOU WOULD WAKE HER AT 3:00.

09:19.289 --> 09:20.991
OH, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

09:20.991 --> 09:23.063
I WOULD NEVER AGREE
TO WAKE A SLEEPING BABY.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.996
OH, SHE'S BEEN DOWN
FOR ALMOST FOUR HOURS.

09:25.996 --> 09:28.198
DAMN IT.
SHE'S GONNA BE UP ALL NIGHT.

09:28.198 --> 09:29.900
YOU STOP YELLING AT ME!

09:29.900 --> 09:33.073
I'M NOT YELLING AT YOU. I'M--
 YES, YOU ARE!

09:33.073 --> 09:35.706
YOU'RE ANGRY AND YOU'RE SAYING
IT'S MY FAULT, AND IT ISN'T!

09:35.706 --> 09:37.007
YOU'RE A LIAR!

09:42.282 --> 09:44.084
SUSAN.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.216
HELLO. UM... WHAT'S THIS?

09:46.216 --> 09:47.958
A PEACE OFFERING.

09:47.958 --> 09:49.920
A WHAT?

09:49.920 --> 09:53.193
PAUL, WE NEED TO MOVE PAST...
THE PAST.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.926
AND YOU HAVE BEEN
A REALLY GOOD TENANT,

09:55.926 --> 09:57.597
AND I APPRECIATE THAT.

09:57.597 --> 10:01.001
YOU NEVER COMPLAIN. YOU'RE NEVER
LATE WITH THE RENT CHECK.

10:01.001 --> 10:04.004
IN FACT, YOU'RE USUALLY EARLY.
AND WHO DOES THAT?

10:04.004 --> 10:06.306
I'M JUST SO LUCKY THAT--
OH, DEAR.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.078
WHAT?

10:08.078 --> 10:11.611
IS--IS THAT A THUMBTACK
ON THE WALL?

10:13.043 --> 10:15.045
WELL, I TRIED WILLING
THE CALENDAR TO STAY UP,

10:15.045 --> 10:17.648
BUT IT JUST WOULDN'T
COOPERATE.

10:17.648 --> 10:19.119
OH, BUT, PAUL,

10:19.119 --> 10:21.121
THAT'S A CLEAR VIOLATION
OF YOUR LEASE AGREEMENT,

10:21.121 --> 10:24.224
WHICH I HAPPEN TO HAVE...
(chuckles)

10:24.224 --> 10:26.356
RIGHT HERE. OH.

10:28.258 --> 10:31.301
SEE? PAGE 2.

10:31.301 --> 10:33.934
STRICTLY NO ALTERATIONS.

10:33.934 --> 10:36.066
SO...

10:36.066 --> 10:39.039
IT APPEARS THAT YOU HAVE 60 DAYS
TO VACATE THE PREMISES.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.041
BUT GOOD NEWS.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.213
I THINK YOU'LL BE GETTING
MOST OF YOUR DEPOSIT BACK.

10:43.213 --> 10:45.215
I'LL JUST NEED TO DEDUCT

10:45.215 --> 10:48.148
THE COST OF REPAIRING
THE THUMBTACK HOLE.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.150
VERY CLEVER, SUSAN,
BUT DO YOU REALLY THINK

10:50.150 --> 10:52.783
YOU'RE IN A POSITION
TO BE MAKING SUCH DEMANDS?

10:52.783 --> 10:54.785
WHY DON'T WE JUST AGREE

10:54.785 --> 10:56.787
TO OVERLOOK
THIS SLIGHT LEASE INFRACTION

10:56.787 --> 10:58.789
BEFORE I CALL YOUR HUSBAND
AND LET HIM KNOW

10:58.789 --> 11:00.861
ABOUT HIS WIFE'S
LITTLE CLEANING FETISH?

11:00.861 --> 11:02.733
HE KNOWS, PAUL.

11:02.733 --> 11:04.865
I TOLD HIM EVERYTHING,

11:04.865 --> 11:08.368
INCLUDING THE PART WHERE
YOU TRIED TO BLACKMAIL ME.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.040
HE WASN'T HAPPY.

11:10.040 --> 11:13.173
SEE THIS?

11:13.173 --> 11:16.176
THIS IS WHAT I HAD
TO PRY OUT OF HIS HAND

11:16.176 --> 11:19.910
SO YOU WOULDN'T NEED A PARAMEDIC
TO PRY IT OUT OF YOUR SKULL.

11:19.910 --> 11:23.113
ALLOW ME TO DEMONSTRATE.

11:23.113 --> 11:25.756
THIS...

11:25.756 --> 11:27.117
IS YOU.

11:29.459 --> 11:33.824
THIS IS YOU IF YOU TELL ANYONE
AND MIKE FINDS OUT.

11:35.365 --> 11:36.767
I UNDERSTAND.

11:39.830 --> 11:42.873
DON'T FORGET. 60 DAYS.

11:45.175 --> 11:47.938
OH! AND ENJOY
THOSE RAISIN MUFFINS.

11:47.938 --> 11:49.940
AT LEAST,
I HOPE THEY'RE ALL RAISINS.

11:49.940 --> 11:52.382
MY APARTMENT HAS RATS.

11:52.382 --> 11:54.184
(door closes)

12:02.052 --> 12:04.354
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE FINALLY
GONNA SEE MY APARTMENT.

12:04.354 --> 12:06.356
ME NEITHER, BUT AS YOU SAID,

12:06.356 --> 12:09.059
WE NEED TO GET TO KNOW
EACH OTHER BETTER.

12:09.059 --> 12:10.730
SO... (sighs)

12:10.730 --> 12:13.864
HERE GOES.

12:16.366 --> 12:18.138
OH, MY GOD.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.140
WHAT'S WRONG?
 WELL, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.142
I HAD
THIS WHOLE FROZEN SMILE READY.

12:22.142 --> 12:24.344
I WAS EXPECTING A BACHELOR PAD--

12:24.344 --> 12:28.018
YOU KNOW, PIZZA BOXES,
DIRTY UNDERWEAR,

12:28.018 --> 12:30.220
NEON BEER CLOCK.
BUT LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

12:30.220 --> 12:32.252
IT'S TASTEFULLY DECORATED

12:32.252 --> 12:34.354
AND SMELLS...
(inhales deeply)

12:34.354 --> 12:37.257
OH, MY. IS THAT POTPOURRI?

12:39.029 --> 12:42.192
I JUST SWITCHED
TO THE... AUTUMN BLEND.

12:42.192 --> 12:45.265
TAKE ME... RIGHT NOW...
ON THE TABLE.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.237
SHOULD I USE A PLACE MAT?

12:47.237 --> 12:48.839
(chuckles)

12:48.839 --> 12:51.942
MMM. MMM.

12:51.942 --> 12:54.144
HELLO.

12:56.807 --> 12:58.979
THAT IS MIMI, MY ROOMMATE.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.450
SEE YA.

13:00.450 --> 13:02.452
(chuckles)

13:04.384 --> 13:06.056
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE

13:06.056 --> 13:09.089
THAT FROZEN SMILE
CAME IN HANDY AFTER ALL.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.922
(wolf howls)

13:11.922 --> 13:15.295
I HAVE TO SAY,
YOU DO KEEP ME ON MY TOES.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.128
THIS IS AN UNEXPECTED SPOT
FOR A FIRST DATE.

13:18.128 --> 13:20.130
WELL,
I KNOW IT SOUNDS CORNY.

13:20.130 --> 13:23.033
BUT YOU TAKE A GIRL
TO A HAUNTED HOUSE,

13:23.033 --> 13:25.575
AND SHE'LL PROBABLY WANNA
GRAB ONTO YOU.

13:25.575 --> 13:27.577
HEY, THAT PUMPKIN BREAD
LOOKS PRETTY GOOD.

13:27.577 --> 13:29.579
WHY DON'T YOU GET US
A COUPLE OF SLICES?

13:29.579 --> 13:32.012
SURE.

13:32.012 --> 13:35.015
(children shouting playfully)

13:38.949 --> 13:41.151
SO... ARE YOU
AN OAKRIDGE PARENT?

13:41.151 --> 13:43.153
OH, YES. WE LOVE THE SCHOOL.

13:43.153 --> 13:45.195
ARE YOU THINKING
OF SENDING YOUR CHILD THERE?

13:45.195 --> 13:47.057
I DON'T THINK SO.

13:47.057 --> 13:49.129
MY FAMILY VALUES
ARE QUITE TRADITIONAL.

13:49.129 --> 13:52.232
I HAPPENED TO HEAR
SOME INFORMATION ABOUT

13:52.232 --> 13:55.065
THE AFTER-SCHOOL ACTIVITIES
OF ONE OF THE TEACHERS.

13:55.065 --> 13:58.368
AND LET'S JUST SAY...
IT WAS TROUBLING.

13:58.368 --> 14:01.071
WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION?

14:01.071 --> 14:06.376
ARE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH A, UM, MRS. DELFINO?

14:08.078 --> 14:10.080
(Paige crying)
 OHH.

14:10.080 --> 14:13.123
(tune of Brahms' "Lullaby")
♪ GO TO SLEEP, GO TO SLEEP ♪

14:13.123 --> 14:17.157
♪ THIS IS ALL GRANDMA'S FAULT ♪

14:17.157 --> 14:20.860
♪ GO TO SLEEP, GO TO SLEEP ♪

14:20.860 --> 14:22.862
(crying continues)

14:22.862 --> 14:27.237
♪ WHY CAN'T SHE PUT
HER THINGS AWAY? ♪

14:27.237 --> 14:32.072
(humming Brahms' "Lullaby")

14:32.072 --> 14:34.404
(stops humming)

14:34.404 --> 14:36.246
(sets jar down)

14:39.609 --> 14:42.412
(click)

14:42.412 --> 14:44.154
YOU OKAY?

14:44.154 --> 14:45.455
WHAT TIME IS IT?

14:45.455 --> 14:46.987
4:12.

14:46.987 --> 14:49.990
I'M SORRY TO WAKE YOU UP,
BUT I AM WORRIED ABOUT YOUR MOM.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.162
I DON'T THINK
SHE'S ALL THERE.

14:52.162 --> 14:56.096
YOU WOKE ME UP AT 4:00 A.M.
TO BITCH ABOUT MY MOM?

14:56.096 --> 14:58.598
YOU COULDN'T DO THAT
DURING BUSINESS HOURS?

14:58.598 --> 15:01.671
NO. LISTEN. SHE SENT ME OUT
TO BUY HAND CREAM

15:01.671 --> 15:04.034
WHEN SHE ALREADY HAD
TEN JARS.

15:04.034 --> 15:07.307
SHE FORGOT
TO WAKE UP THE BABY.
 SHE'S OLDER.
SHE FORGETS SOME THINGS.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.309
NO! SHE ALSO HAS THESE...

15:09.309 --> 15:11.041
(exhales deeply)

15:11.041 --> 15:13.113
INTENSE MOOD SWINGS.

15:13.113 --> 15:16.386
I MEAN, TODAY, SHE ALMOST
TOOK MY HEAD OFF FOR NO REASON.

15:16.386 --> 15:18.088
WELL, SHE'S--
 AND THEN--

15:18.088 --> 15:20.220
AND THEN SHE LOOKED LIKE
SHE WAS GONNA BURST INTO TEARS.

15:20.220 --> 15:23.523
SHE'S AWAY FROM HOME. SHE ISN'T
USED TO ALL THIS CHAOS.

15:23.523 --> 15:26.196
OKAY. I GET IT.

15:26.196 --> 15:28.198
SHE'S YOUR MOM,
AND YOU LOVE HER,

15:28.198 --> 15:31.231
AND YOU CAN LOOK FOR AN EXCUSE
FOR EVERY ONE OF THESE THINGS.

15:31.231 --> 15:34.004
BUT I THINK THERE'S MORE
GOING ON HERE

15:34.004 --> 15:36.936
THAN JUST HER BEING
A LITTLE FORGETFUL.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.568
UGH.

15:38.568 --> 15:40.240
(sighs)

15:40.240 --> 15:42.242
YOUR LIGHT'S ON.

15:55.685 --> 15:57.557
HEY, MOM.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.559
MMM.
 MWAH.

15:59.559 --> 16:02.332
HOW YOU DOING?

16:02.332 --> 16:04.064
YOU OKAY?

16:04.064 --> 16:05.495
YES.

16:05.495 --> 16:09.099
WHY DO YOU ASK?
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

16:11.201 --> 16:13.443
YOU JUST SEEM A LITTLE...

16:13.443 --> 16:16.076
A LITTLE SCATTERED LATELY.

16:16.076 --> 16:18.108
H-HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT?

16:18.108 --> 16:21.081
THERE'S MY LITTLE WORRYWART.

16:22.752 --> 16:25.185
REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE
AT CAMP KICKAPOO?

16:25.185 --> 16:27.457
YOU WERE SURE HURRICANE BELLE
HAD KILLED US ALL

16:27.457 --> 16:30.290
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS
OFF THE COAST OF GEORGIA.

16:30.290 --> 16:34.324
A-AND THAT--THAT MEAN COUNSELOR
BOB WOULDN'T LET ME CALL YOU.

16:34.324 --> 16:36.396
HIS NAME WAS ANDY.

16:36.396 --> 16:38.628
MY GOD, YOU'RE RIGHT.
 AND YOU DID CALL.

16:38.628 --> 16:41.171
YOU EVEN MADE ME
PUT THE DOG ON THE PHONE.

16:41.171 --> 16:43.503
WHICH YOU DID. (laughs)

16:43.503 --> 16:46.106
(laughs) NO. I JUST BARKED
A COUPLE OF TIMES.

16:46.106 --> 16:48.238
RUFF RUFF! (laughs)

16:48.238 --> 16:50.210
SPARKY WAS ASLEEP.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.442
OH, I BETTER
GO GET DRESSED.

16:52.442 --> 16:56.616
I TOLD PENNY I'D HELP HER
WITH HER COSTUME.

16:56.616 --> 16:59.018
OKAY.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.520
DID YOU SEE THAT?

17:00.520 --> 17:03.623
SHE'S REMEMBERING THINGS
THAT I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER.

17:03.623 --> 17:06.156
YEAH, BUT IT'S 9:00
IN THE MORNING, AND...

17:06.156 --> 17:08.157
AND WHAT?

17:08.157 --> 17:10.160
I'VE BEEN DOING
A LITTLE RESEARCH,

17:10.160 --> 17:12.332
AND THERE IS THIS THING
CALLED SUNDOWNING.

17:12.332 --> 17:15.535
A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA
DON'T SHOW SIGNS IN THE DAY.

17:15.535 --> 17:18.238
IT'S ONLY AT NIGHT
THAT THEY GET CONFUSED.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.540
DID YOU NOT JUST HEAR HER?
MY MOTHER IS NOT SENILE.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.242
LET'S BE HONEST.

17:22.242 --> 17:24.714
YOU'VE BEEN TRYING
TO GET HER OUT OF THIS HOUSE

17:24.714 --> 17:27.717
EVER SINCE SHE WALKED IN.
 YOU THINK THIS IS A TACTIC?

17:27.717 --> 17:30.720
THE OTHER DAY, SHE MADE TEA THEN
LEFT THE STOVE ON FOR AN HOUR.

17:30.720 --> 17:33.283
(sighs)
 THERE HAS BEEN
A LOT OF STUFF LIKE THAT,

17:33.283 --> 17:35.285
AND I'M STARTING
TO GET WORRIED.

17:35.285 --> 17:37.387
MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE HER
TO THE DOCTOR.

17:37.387 --> 17:38.588
NO!

17:38.588 --> 17:39.829
TOM--
 NO!

17:39.829 --> 17:41.831
UNTIL WE KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON,

17:41.831 --> 17:44.664
I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE
WITH HER WATCHING THE BABY.

17:44.664 --> 17:47.297
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG
WITH MY MOTHER, OKAY?

17:47.297 --> 17:48.598
SO JUST DROP IT!

18:00.380 --> 18:03.383
(dishes clattering)

18:07.517 --> 18:10.760
MORNING. DO YOU WANT
SOMETHING TO EAT OR SOME TEA?

18:10.760 --> 18:12.492
OH. TEA WOULD BE LOVELY.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.324
HOW DO YOU TAKE IT?

18:14.324 --> 18:16.095
WITH AN EXPLANATION.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.529
I'M SORRY. KEITH DIDN'T TELL ME
THAT HE HAD A FEMALE ROOMMATE.

18:19.529 --> 18:22.332
AND, YES, HE SAID THAT YOU TWO
NEVER SLEPT TOGETHER--

18:22.332 --> 18:24.474
WELL, EXCEPT FOR
THOSE TWO TIMES.

18:24.474 --> 18:27.177
WHAT?! WE NEVER HAD SEX!

18:27.177 --> 18:29.179
(chuckles) THAT'S REALLY
WHAT HE SAID.

18:29.179 --> 18:31.311
I JUST NEEDED
TO SEE YOUR REACTION

18:31.311 --> 18:34.314
TO KNOW THAT IT WAS TRUE.
 NICELY DONE.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.146
THANK YOU.

18:36.146 --> 18:38.218
BY THE WAY, YOU DON'T NEED
TO WORRY ABOUT OTHER WOMEN.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.220
THE GUY NEVER STOPS
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.722
OH, THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.

18:42.722 --> 18:45.325
WELL, I'M GONNA
GRAB A SHOWER.

18:45.325 --> 18:48.328
HERE'S YOUR TEA.
WATER WILL BE READY IN A MINUTE.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.330
OH, AND, UH,
WHEN KEITH WAKES UP,

18:50.330 --> 18:53.333
COULD YOU JUST
GIVE HIM HIS MAIL?
 SURE.

19:16.886 --> 19:20.360
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T COME TO
DELIVER YOUR R.S.V.P. IN PERSON.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.491
WHAT'S UP?

19:21.491 --> 19:23.493
WELL, I NEED
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

19:23.493 --> 19:25.895
IN THE TIME THAT YOU AND KEITH
SPENT TOGETHER,

19:25.895 --> 19:28.668
DID YOU EVER HAVE THE SENSE
THAT HE MIGHT BE--

19:28.668 --> 19:30.870
INTO BONY OLD WHITE LADIES?

19:30.870 --> 19:32.242
DEFINITELY.

19:32.242 --> 19:34.244
NO,
WHAT I WAS WONDERING IS,

19:34.244 --> 19:37.347
HAVE YOU EVER GOTTEN A VIBE THAT
HE MIGHT BE A LITTLE... CRAZY?

19:37.347 --> 19:39.379
OH. WELL, LET ME THINK.

19:39.379 --> 19:41.381
OUR FIRST DATE WAS CUT SHORT

19:41.381 --> 19:43.413
WHEN YOU SABOTAGED
YOUR OWN SPRINKLER SYSTEM.

19:43.413 --> 19:46.216
OUR SECOND WAS DERAILED

19:46.216 --> 19:48.518
WHEN YOU TERRORIZED ME
WITH A LITTLE PERSON.

19:48.518 --> 19:52.191
NO, I THINK THE VIBE I PICKED UP
IS YOU'RE CRAZY.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.264
RENEE, YOU'RE NOT BEING
VERY HELPFUL.

19:54.264 --> 19:56.796
FINE. YOU WANNA TELL ME
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

19:56.796 --> 19:59.329
I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT
IF HE'S DANGEROUS.

19:59.329 --> 20:03.733
I RECENTLY DISCOVERED THAT HE IS
ON PROBATION FOR ASSAULT.

20:03.733 --> 20:05.875
OH. THAT?

20:05.875 --> 20:07.707
YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?

20:07.707 --> 20:09.809
YEAH. IT HAPPENED AT THE BAR
WHERE I MET HIM.

20:09.809 --> 20:12.282
ABOUT A YEAR AGO, HE BROUGHT
HIS GIRLFRIEND THERE.

20:12.282 --> 20:15.545
SOME GUY STARTED HITTING ON HER,
SO KEITH FLATTENED HIM.

20:15.545 --> 20:17.387
KEITH TOLD YOU THAT?

20:17.387 --> 20:19.389
NO, THE BARTENDER DID.

20:19.389 --> 20:21.891
I ALWAYS CHECK OUT THE GUYS
BEFORE I BRING 'EM HOME.

20:21.891 --> 20:24.654
DON'T WANNA END UP HANDCUFFED
TO MY BED FOR THREE DAYS...

20:24.654 --> 20:25.895
AGAIN.

20:25.895 --> 20:29.559
SO... KEITH WAS DEFENDING
HIS GIRLFRIEND.

20:29.559 --> 20:32.732
WELL, IT'S NICE TO KNOW
THAT CHIVALRY ISN'T DEAD.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.535
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER WAY
TO FIND OUT IF HE'S VIOLENT.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.507
HOW?

20:37.507 --> 20:40.770
WELL, START A FIGHT WITH HIM.
IF HE SLUGS YOU, HE'S VIOLENT.

20:43.573 --> 20:46.776
WHOEVER LEFT YOU HANDCUFFED
TO THE BED FOR THREE DAYS...

20:46.776 --> 20:48.518
HE HAS MY RESPECT.

20:48.518 --> 20:49.949
(puckers lips)

20:51.921 --> 20:55.024
NOW, GRACE, THIS IS THE FIRST
TIME I'VE MADE A COSTUME,

20:55.024 --> 20:57.287
SO IF YOU HATE IT,
JUST TELL ME.

20:57.287 --> 20:58.588
(Grace) I LOVE IT.

20:58.588 --> 21:01.260
I'VE NEVER HAD SUCH
A PRETTY COSTUME BEFORE.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.694
THANK YOU!
YOU'RE THE COOLEST MOM EVER!

21:06.396 --> 21:09.268
LOOK, MOMMY! WOOF! WOOF!

21:09.268 --> 21:11.040
YOU'RE ADORABLE!

21:11.040 --> 21:13.042
(laughs)

21:13.042 --> 21:15.044
(gasps)

21:15.044 --> 21:16.446
OH, GRACE.

21:16.446 --> 21:18.047
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

21:18.047 --> 21:20.009
LIKE A REAL PRINCESS.

21:20.009 --> 21:21.451
I FEEL LIKE ONE.

21:21.451 --> 21:23.753
OHH.

21:23.753 --> 21:26.856
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT
EVERY PRINCESS NEEDS?

21:26.856 --> 21:28.918
LOOK,
I CAN ALSO WAG MY TAIL.

21:28.918 --> 21:30.920
OKAY, HANG ON, SWEETIE.

21:30.920 --> 21:35.064
NOW ONCE I PUT THIS ON, I'M
GONNA STYLE YOUR HAIR AROUND IT.
 OKAY.

21:35.064 --> 21:36.826
CAN YOU STYLE MY HAIR?

21:36.826 --> 21:39.669
BUT, SWEETIE,
IT DOESN'T EVEN SHOW.

21:39.669 --> 21:41.901
BUT I AM GONNA GO OVER YOU
WITH A LINT ROLLER.

21:44.634 --> 21:46.536
I WANNA BE A PRINCESS.

21:46.536 --> 21:49.379
WHAT? ALL YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT
FOR THE LAST FOUR MONTHS

21:49.379 --> 21:51.381
IS HOW MUCH YOU WANTED
TO GO AS A DOG.

21:51.381 --> 21:52.842
I CHANGED MY MIND.

21:52.842 --> 21:54.344
WELL, I'M SORRY.

21:54.344 --> 21:56.346
YOU'RE EITHER GOING AS A DOG
OR A LITTLE MEXICAN GIRL.

21:56.346 --> 21:58.348
AND IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD,

21:58.348 --> 22:00.420
WE BOTH KNOW WHICH ONE'S
GETTING MORE CANDY.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.752
LET'S GO TO THE MIRROR,
SWEETIE. OKAY.
 OKAY.

22:04.323 --> 22:09.599
SO YOUR PUMPKIN CAN HAVE
A HAPPY FACE OR A SCARY FACE.

22:09.599 --> 22:10.760
MS. DELFINO?

22:12.432 --> 22:14.434
PRINCIPAL HOBSON
WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU.

22:14.434 --> 22:16.906
HE SEEMS UPSET
ABOUT SOMETHING.

22:18.768 --> 22:21.741
(banging)

22:21.741 --> 22:22.912
(door opens)

22:22.912 --> 22:24.374
THERE YOU ARE.

22:24.374 --> 22:26.376
YOUR SON'S BEEN WAITING
FOUR MILLION YEARS

22:26.376 --> 22:28.418
TO GO TRICK-OR-TREATING.

22:28.418 --> 22:29.919
ME WANT CANDY. UGH!

22:29.919 --> 22:31.921
OHH. OKAY, SWEETIE.

22:31.921 --> 22:34.123
WHY DON'T YOU GO GET YOUR
TENNIS SHOES ON AND WE'LL GO?

22:34.123 --> 22:37.587
WHAT'S WITH THE BOX?
(sighs)

22:37.587 --> 22:40.029
YOU OKAY?

22:40.029 --> 22:42.492
I GOT FIRED.

22:42.492 --> 22:44.394
WHAT?

22:44.394 --> 22:46.736
THEY FOUND OUT
ABOUT THE WEB SITE.

22:46.736 --> 22:49.038
(groans)

22:49.038 --> 22:50.400
PAUL!

22:50.400 --> 22:53.403
THIS TIME, I'M GONNA KILL HIM,
AND YOU'RE NOT STOPPING ME.

22:53.403 --> 22:55.975
MIKE, NO. IT--IT WASN'T HIM.

22:55.975 --> 22:58.948
ONE OF THE MOMS
CALLED THE SCHOOL,

22:58.948 --> 23:01.851
PROBABLY CAUGHT HER HUSBAND
WATCHING IT OR SOMETHING.

23:03.853 --> 23:05.154
(sighs)

23:07.957 --> 23:10.460
SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

23:10.460 --> 23:12.462
WE CAN'T MAKE IT
ON WHAT I'M BRINGING IN.

23:12.462 --> 23:15.164
I'LL FIND ANOTHER JOB.

23:15.164 --> 23:16.526
I'LL...

23:16.526 --> 23:18.968
YOU'LL WHAT?

23:25.875 --> 23:27.807
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:27.807 --> 23:30.139
I'M CALLING TOMMY GLENN
IN ALASKA.

23:30.139 --> 23:32.141
HE SAID WHENEVER
I WAS READY--
 NO ALASKA.

23:32.141 --> 23:34.814
YOU'LL BE GONE THREE MONTHS.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT TO M.J.

23:34.814 --> 23:36.816
DO WHAT?
 MAKE AN HONEST LIVING?

23:36.816 --> 23:39.118
HOW MUCH THOUGHT
DID YOU GIVE M.J.

23:39.118 --> 23:42.191
WHEN YOU WERE DANCING AROUND
IN YOUR UNDERWEAR?

23:42.191 --> 23:44.454
PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT.

23:44.454 --> 23:47.827
AND NOW ONE OF THE MOMS
AT THE SCHOOL KNOWS,

23:47.827 --> 23:51.100
SO THERE'S A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE
HE'S GONNA HEAR ABOUT IT.

23:51.100 --> 23:53.603
NO, SUSAN, YOU DON'T GET
TO MAKE THE DECISIONS

23:53.603 --> 23:56.766
ABOUT WHAT'S BEST
FOR THIS FAMILY ANYMORE. I DO.

23:58.868 --> 24:03.142
TAKE M.J. TRICK-OR-TREATING.
I'M GONNA MAKE THIS PHONE CALL.

24:08.147 --> 24:12.652
I HAD A LOVELY TIME
AT DINNER TONIGHT.

24:12.652 --> 24:15.885
IT WAS NICE TO HEAR ALL THOSE
STORIES ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD.

24:15.885 --> 24:19.458
IT WAS NICE TELLING THEM.
THOSE WERE HAPPY DAYS.

24:19.458 --> 24:22.031
I LIKED REMEMBERING THEM.

24:22.031 --> 24:25.695
CAN I GIVE YOU
AN ODD COMPLIMENT?

24:25.695 --> 24:29.839
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE PAST,
IT CHANGES HOW YOU LOOK.

24:29.839 --> 24:31.871
YOU'RE NOT SO...

24:31.871 --> 24:33.142
INTIMIDATING.

24:35.144 --> 24:38.207
WELL, THAT IS
AN ODD COMPLIMENT.

24:38.207 --> 24:40.810
BUT I... APPRECIATE IT.

24:42.111 --> 24:43.783
W-W-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

24:43.783 --> 24:47.587
I WAS RESPONDING TO WHAT
I THOUGHT WAS A SIGNAL FROM YOU.

24:47.587 --> 24:49.589
I WASN'T SIGNALING FOR YOU

24:49.589 --> 24:51.621
TO TRY TO JAM YOUR TONGUE
DOWN MY THROAT.

24:51.621 --> 24:53.623
BETH, I'M NOT

24:55.625 --> 24:59.899
I COULD'VE GONE TO A BAR
OR ANY STREET CORNER WEEKS AGO.
 THEN WHAT DO YOU WANT?

24:59.899 --> 25:02.972
I WANNA CONNECT WITH YOU,
TO HAVE A REAL MARRIAGE.

25:02.972 --> 25:06.005
AND, YES, SEX IS PART OF THAT.
BUT THERE'S MORE.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.638
WITH WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH,

25:08.638 --> 25:13.242
I NEED A PARTNER BY MY SIDE,
SOMEONE THAT I CAN TRUST.

25:13.242 --> 25:17.016
I THINK
YOU CAN BE THAT PERSON.

25:17.016 --> 25:19.148

33:15.394 --> 33:18.527
BOY, I REALLY HOPE
YOU MARRY WELL.

33:18.527 --> 33:21.370
(Grace screams)

33:22.401 --> 33:24.033
(gasps)

33:24.033 --> 33:28.277
SHE WAS HAVING A PROBLEM.
I FIXED IT.

33:28.277 --> 33:30.279
(gasps)

33:30.279 --> 33:32.281
REALLY? YOU'RE NOT JUST
SAYING THAT?

33:32.281 --> 33:35.284
NO, LEE, YOU ARE A MUCH PRETTIER
MARILYN THAN SHE IS.

33:35.284 --> 33:37.286
J.F.K. WOULD BE
ALL OVER THAT.

33:37.286 --> 33:38.787
(cell phone rings)
 HMM.

33:38.787 --> 33:40.289
OH, HANG ON.
 (beep)

33:40.289 --> 33:43.422
OH, HEY, CARLOS.
WHAT'S UP?

33:43.422 --> 33:47.126
OH, I... O-OKAY. I WILL BE--
I WILL BE RIGHT THERE.

33:47.126 --> 33:49.128
(beep)
 (whispers) SHOOT.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.342
(gasps)

34:03.342 --> 34:05.314
IT'S ME.

34:05.314 --> 34:06.615
LYNETTE?

34:06.615 --> 34:07.646
YEAH.

34:07.646 --> 34:10.379
OH! THANK GOD.

34:10.379 --> 34:12.751
OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

34:12.751 --> 34:16.585
I WAS WALKING. I-I-I MUST
HAVE GOT TURNED AROUND.

34:16.585 --> 34:20.259
I MADE IT UP--UP TO
CLAIRE GRAHAM'S PLACE,

34:20.259 --> 34:25.264
BUT... (voice breaking)
THE LIGHTS WERE OUT.

34:25.264 --> 34:27.766
THERE IS NO CLAIRE GRAHAM
ON THIS STREET.

34:27.766 --> 34:32.141
OH, THERE MOST CERTAINLY IS.
SHE... LIVES...

34:33.601 --> 34:36.844
OH. LET'S JUST...
LET'S GO HOME.

34:36.844 --> 34:40.478
YOU LET GO OF ME!
YOU'RE DOING THIS TO ME.

34:40.478 --> 34:42.710
YOU'RE MAKING ME FEEL CRAZY.
 OH, ALLISON--

34:42.710 --> 34:44.313
I SAID LET GO!
 (slap)

34:44.313 --> 34:46.255
OHH!

34:48.456 --> 34:52.161
I'M SO SORRY, DEAR.
UH...

34:52.161 --> 34:54.163
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE MY HEAD IS.

34:54.163 --> 34:58.367
I'VE NEVER DONE THAT...
BEFORE.

35:02.801 --> 35:04.873
TELL HER, TOMMY.

35:07.136 --> 35:10.309
IT'S OKAY, MOM.

35:10.309 --> 35:11.780
I'M HERE.

35:14.213 --> 35:18.387
MAMA, THAT IS WHAT HE SAID.

35:18.387 --> 35:20.789
"I WANT YOU GONE."

35:20.789 --> 35:24.293
THOSE WERE HIS EXACT WORDS.

35:24.293 --> 35:28.797
I AM. I-I AM TRYING
TO MAKE IT WORK, I SWEAR.

35:28.797 --> 35:31.300
I DO EVERYTHING HE ASKS OF ME.

35:34.303 --> 35:37.336
MAYBE I SHOULD COME HOME.

35:37.336 --> 35:39.338
BUT, YES, I KNOW I MADE
A COMMITMENT,

35:39.338 --> 35:42.341
BUT I AM SO UNHAPPY.

35:46.175 --> 35:50.279
OF COURSE I WANT YOU
TO BE PROUD OF ME.

35:50.279 --> 35:52.150
OKAY. UH...

35:53.782 --> 35:56.325
I-I-I-I WILL.

35:59.328 --> 36:00.789
I'LL TRY.

36:03.332 --> 36:05.334
BYE, MAMA.

36:05.334 --> 36:06.495
(beep)

36:06.495 --> 36:09.798
SUSAN! HANG ON.
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

36:09.798 --> 36:12.801
OW, OW, OW. STILETTO HEELS,
WHY DO YOU HATE ME?

36:12.801 --> 36:14.303
WHAT'S UP?

36:14.303 --> 36:17.306
PAUL YOUNG WANTED ME TO ASK
AGAIN IF YOU HAD ANY INTEREST

36:17.306 --> 36:18.807
IN SELLING YOUR PLACE.

36:18.807 --> 36:20.309
NO. HE KNOWS THAT.

36:20.309 --> 36:22.811
IN FACT, HE'S VACATING
OUR HOUSE IN 60 DAYS.

36:22.811 --> 36:24.813
WELL, HE INSISTED
I CHECK AGAIN.

36:24.813 --> 36:27.316
HE SAID YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES
HAD RECENTLY CHANGED, AND...

36:27.316 --> 36:31.490
WAIT. WHEN DID HE SAY THAT,
EXACTLY?

36:31.490 --> 36:32.761
THIS MORNING.

36:37.526 --> 36:39.468
(sighs) CAN YOU TAKE M.J.

36:39.468 --> 36:42.471
TO MRS. McCLUSKEY'S FOR ME?
 SURE.

36:42.471 --> 36:45.504
SWEETIE, MOMMY'S GONNA HOLD THAT
FOR YOU.

36:45.504 --> 36:47.336
(doorbell rings)

36:47.336 --> 36:49.378
SUSAN.

36:49.378 --> 36:52.241
YOU BASTARD!

36:52.241 --> 36:53.612
(glass shatters)

36:53.612 --> 36:56.315
SUSAN,
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

36:56.315 --> 36:58.417
WHEN YOU MOVED HERE,

36:58.417 --> 37:01.420
I TRIED TO GIVE YOU
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT!

37:01.420 --> 37:03.252
BUT YOU'RE EVIL!

37:03.252 --> 37:06.355
WELL, GUESS WHAT?
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT IS OVER!

37:06.355 --> 37:08.557
(doorbell rings)

37:08.557 --> 37:11.330
(children, singsongy)
TRICK OR TREAT!

37:11.330 --> 37:14.232
HE'S OUT OF CANDY!
(panting)

37:14.232 --> 37:15.564
YOU KNOW WHAT?

37:15.564 --> 37:17.866
I'M GLAD I DIDN'T LET
MIKE DO THIS.

37:17.866 --> 37:19.868
'CAUSE I'M REALLY
ENJOYING IT!

37:19.868 --> 37:21.670
(Beth) GET AWAY FROM HIM.

37:24.343 --> 37:26.745
BETH, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S DONE.

37:26.745 --> 37:29.948
I DON'T CARE.

37:29.948 --> 37:31.450
HE'S MY HUSBAND.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.754
(click)

37:35.754 --> 37:37.986
NOW GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE.

37:46.965 --> 37:50.268
(thud, clatter)

37:54.803 --> 37:57.906
ARE YOU OKAY?

37:57.906 --> 38:00.048
YEAH.

38:00.048 --> 38:01.880
THANK YOU.

38:19.828 --> 38:22.331
WELL, I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.
MRS. SANCHEZ WAS FURIOUS

38:22.331 --> 38:24.833
WHEN SHE SAW WHAT YOU DID
TO GRACE'S HAIR.

38:24.833 --> 38:26.835
FORTUNATELY,
THAT SWEET LITTLE GIRL

38:26.835 --> 38:30.339
SAW I WAS IN A JAM
AND SAID IT WAS HER IDEA.
 OF COURSE SHE DID.

38:30.339 --> 38:31.680
WELL, THANK GOD.

38:31.680 --> 38:34.613
OTHERWISE, SHE WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO COME HERE AND PLAY ANYMORE.

38:34.613 --> 38:36.014
WHO CARES?

38:36.014 --> 38:38.647
HONEY, GRACE IS YOUR FRIEND.

38:38.647 --> 38:40.819
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HER
TILL A MONTH AGO.

38:40.819 --> 38:43.021
BUT YOU LOVE
SPENDING TIME WITH HER.

38:43.021 --> 38:44.493
NO, YOU DO.

38:44.493 --> 38:47.496
YOU'RE ALWAYS TALKING TO HER,
KISSING HER,

38:47.496 --> 38:49.327
STARING AT HER.

38:49.327 --> 38:50.999
YOU LIKE HER BETTER THAN ME.

38:50.999 --> 38:53.362
OH, THAT'S RIDICULOUS!

38:53.362 --> 38:55.364
THEN WHY DID YOU GIVE HER
THAT NECKLACE?

38:55.364 --> 38:57.906
YOU DON'T EVEN LET ME
TOUCH YOUR JEWELRY.

38:57.906 --> 39:00.539
WHAT'S SO SPECIAL
ABOUT GRACE?

39:03.642 --> 39:06.014
WHATEVER.

39:13.552 --> 39:15.684
THIS IS BAD.

39:15.684 --> 39:18.727
SHE KNOWS SOMETHING IS UP.
I THINK WE SHOULD PULL BACK,

39:18.727 --> 39:20.729
STAY AWAY FROM GRACE
FOR A WHILE.

39:20.729 --> 39:25.033
NO! NO WAY. NO, NO, NO.
I'LL JUST BE MORE CAREFUL.

39:25.033 --> 39:27.436
IT'LL BE FINE.

39:27.436 --> 39:30.368
GABY, WE HAVE TO PROTECT
OUR DAUGHTER.

39:30.368 --> 39:33.041
THEY'RE BOTH OUR DAUGHTERS.

39:36.545 --> 39:38.777
I REALLY DON'T WANT YOU
TO GO.

39:38.777 --> 39:40.779
I DON'T WANNA GO EITHER,

39:40.779 --> 39:42.781
BUT THIS WILL MAKE US
ENOUGH MONEY

39:42.781 --> 39:46.455
TO GET PAUL OUT OF OUR HOUSE
AND GIVE US OUR LIVES BACK.

39:46.455 --> 39:47.986
PLUS IF I STAY,

39:47.986 --> 39:50.889
I'M AFRAID I'LL KILL HIM.

39:59.868 --> 40:04.433
OKAY. CAR'S LOADED.

40:04.433 --> 40:05.874
IT'S TIME TO GO.

40:05.874 --> 40:08.537
TO THE NURSING HOME.

40:08.537 --> 40:11.880
MOM, AGAIN,
IT ISN'T A NURSING HOME.

40:11.880 --> 40:13.181
IT'S ASSISTED LIVING.
IT'S--

40:13.181 --> 40:17.045
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL FACILITY
WITH--WITH FLOWER BEDS

40:17.045 --> 40:19.748
AND ACTIVITIES AND LOTS
OF OTHER PEOPLE. IT'S...

40:19.748 --> 40:21.750
JUST TELL ME THIS, TOMMY.

40:21.750 --> 40:24.453
AFTER I GO THERE,
WHEN DO I GET TO LEAVE?

40:24.453 --> 40:26.555
WHEN DO I GET TO GO HOME?

40:26.555 --> 40:28.757
WE'LL HAVE TO SEE
WHAT THE DOCTORS SAY.

40:28.757 --> 40:30.459
NEVER, THAT'S WHEN.

40:30.459 --> 40:32.761
I'VE SEEN MY FRIENDS
GO INTO THESE PLACES,

40:32.761 --> 40:34.833
AND THEY DON'T COME BACK.

40:34.833 --> 40:37.065
MOM...

40:39.738 --> 40:44.913
I TALKED TO PETER AND THERESA,
AND WE ALL AGREE.

40:46.174 --> 40:49.077
YOU CAN'T LIVE BY YOURSELF
ANYMORE.

40:49.077 --> 40:52.050
IF SOMETHING BAD
WERE TO HAPPEN TO YOU,

40:52.050 --> 40:54.883
WE WOULD NEVER... (kisses)

40:54.883 --> 40:56.184
FORGIVE OURSELVES.

40:56.184 --> 40:58.186
THE ONLY THING BAD
HAPPENING HERE

40:58.186 --> 41:00.629
IS WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO ME.

41:06.565 --> 41:10.569
MOM... I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

41:10.569 --> 41:15.203
WHEN YOU CALLED ME
AT THAT CAMP

41:15.203 --> 41:19.578
AND YOU WERE SCARED,
YOU KEPT SAYING,

41:19.578 --> 41:21.850
"I WANT TO COME HOME, MOM."

41:21.850 --> 41:27.586
AND I SAID,
"TOMMY, IF YOU MEAN THAT,

41:27.586 --> 41:29.918
I'LL COME GET YOU."

41:31.860 --> 41:34.623
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

41:41.570 --> 41:43.071
(sighs)

42:01.920 --> 42:05.754
THE TIME COMES
WHEN WE ALL MUST FIND OUT

42:05.754 --> 42:08.096
WHAT WE'RE AFRAID OF.

42:11.099 --> 42:13.101
SOME OF US FEAR...

42:13.101 --> 42:16.264
"SHE MAY NEVER FORGIVE ME."

42:16.264 --> 42:19.237
OTHERS WORRY...

42:19.237 --> 42:22.240
"SHE MIGHT LEARN THE TRUTH."

42:24.212 --> 42:26.575
A FEW WONDER...

42:26.575 --> 42:29.247
"COULD HE SEND ME AWAY?"

42:32.921 --> 42:37.726
YES.
THE WORLD IS A SCARY PLACE.

42:37.726 --> 42:41.930
IT'S EVEN MORE TERRIFYING...

42:41.930 --> 42:44.693
IF WE HAVE TO FACE IT...

42:46.264 --> 42:48.336
ALONE.
