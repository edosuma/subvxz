WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:02.518
MARY:<i> Previously on</i> Reign...
I need you, Nicholas.

00:02.519 --> 00:05.036
France?
I've appointed you
the new English ambassador.

00:05.039 --> 00:08.474
How often do the queen of France
and the king of Navarre

00:08.476 --> 00:09.341
get to meet?

00:09.343 --> 00:10.476
I am dying.

00:10.478 --> 00:12.011
Charles will
inherit my throne.

00:12.013 --> 00:13.545
A young king needs a regent.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.214
You want me to marry Charles.

00:15.216 --> 00:16.648
I would be honored
if you would agree

00:16.650 --> 00:18.784
to be my wife.
The honor is mine.

00:18.786 --> 00:20.152
Clearly we should have taken
your head

00:20.154 --> 00:21.286
when you last betrayed your son.

00:21.288 --> 00:23.088
Now you've betrayed
your nation

00:23.090 --> 00:25.090
by consorting with an enemy.
Take her.

00:25.092 --> 00:26.425
Don't think
of crossing us again.

00:26.427 --> 00:29.094
I want the king!

00:31.265 --> 00:33.098
MARY:
I hope you recognize, Charles,

00:33.100 --> 00:35.634
how vital our commitment will be
to each other in the future.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.236
When we are married...

00:37.238 --> 00:39.171
You don't have to worry
about that, Mary.

00:39.173 --> 00:41.774
I know I'm young, and you
may assume I'm inexperienced,

00:41.776 --> 00:45.044
but I promise I'll
give you an heir.

00:45.046 --> 00:47.246
Actually, I was talking

00:47.248 --> 00:48.580
about the future
of the alliance

00:48.582 --> 00:50.249
between France and Scotland.

00:50.251 --> 00:52.651
Oh. Well, um...

00:52.653 --> 00:55.254
I only meant that an heir will
be important for the alliance.

00:55.256 --> 00:56.588
Of course.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.257
I love my brother.

00:58.259 --> 00:59.658
He's protected me all my life,

00:59.660 --> 01:01.326
and he loves you and...

01:01.328 --> 01:02.828
and who knows, he may live
for a long while yet.

01:02.830 --> 01:05.497
Charles, I don't quite
think you understand.

01:05.499 --> 01:06.832
Is-is that Constance?

01:06.834 --> 01:09.268
I invited her,

01:09.270 --> 01:11.203
but I can't believe she came
all the way from Toulouse.

01:12.306 --> 01:13.539
Constance!

01:15.142 --> 01:16.241
You'll have to
excuse me, Mary.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.376
We'll talk later.

01:19.346 --> 01:20.712
Seems he's rather enamored

01:20.714 --> 01:22.247
with the Duke of
Toulouse's daughter.

01:22.249 --> 01:23.816
Sorry, I couldn't
help but overhear.

01:23.818 --> 01:25.484
Constance...
MARY:
At least somebody else sees

01:25.486 --> 01:26.685
I've got my work
cut out for me.

01:26.687 --> 01:29.655
Yes, he's very...

01:29.657 --> 01:31.690
young.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.492
Well, there is some good news.

01:33.494 --> 01:35.394
Our military in Scotland

01:35.396 --> 01:37.763
is close to claiming a victory
over the Protestants.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.798
And what about Francis?

01:39.800 --> 01:41.200
Is he feeling any better?

01:41.202 --> 01:43.802
He hasn't left his room in days.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.671
He doesn't want anyone
to know he's ill.

01:45.673 --> 01:48.140
He's desperate
to handle his affairs

01:48.142 --> 01:49.174
before word gets out.

01:49.176 --> 01:50.542
The English Ambassador.

01:53.380 --> 01:54.480
Sir Nicholas.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.849
And how are you enjoying France?

01:56.851 --> 01:59.351
I'm still waiting to be granted
an audience with the king.

01:59.353 --> 02:02.588
King Francis has traveled
to the Cathedral in Reims

02:02.590 --> 02:04.823
for a period
of seclusion and prayer.

02:04.825 --> 02:05.891
When he returns,

02:05.893 --> 02:07.626
you will be the first received.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.666
He's already sniffing around.

02:30.351 --> 02:32.351
(gasps) Oh...!

02:32.353 --> 02:35.354
I thought Catherine was in
the infirmary because she fell.

02:35.356 --> 02:36.588
That's what
the servants thought

02:36.590 --> 02:38.223
when they found her
a few days ago,

02:38.225 --> 02:39.391
but it turns out
she's recovering

02:39.393 --> 02:40.626
from self-inflicted wounds.

02:40.628 --> 02:43.362
Self-inflicted how?

02:43.364 --> 02:45.330
Catherine threw herself
against a door, repeatedly,

02:45.332 --> 02:47.366
and then bit out
a piece of her own cheek.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.501
A servant found it this morning
whilst cleaning the dungeon.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.637
Good God, even the
rats wouldn't eat it.

02:51.639 --> 02:54.606
She's demanding to see Francis,
and she's threatening

02:54.608 --> 02:57.509
to do further harm to herself
if refused.

02:57.511 --> 03:00.546
Let me see my son,
you bloodsucker!

03:00.548 --> 03:02.948
Francis doesn't want
to see you ever again.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.716
So don't waste any more flesh.

03:04.718 --> 03:06.485
You would keep me
from my firstborn

03:06.487 --> 03:07.519
in his final days?

03:07.521 --> 03:08.854
What kind of a monster are you?

03:08.856 --> 03:10.322
Monster?!

03:10.324 --> 03:12.257
Catherine, take a look
in the mirror.

03:12.259 --> 03:13.325
You brought this on yourself.

03:13.327 --> 03:14.893
Have you ever once considered

03:14.895 --> 03:17.763
you are the cause
of all of this tragedy?

03:17.765 --> 03:19.831
You can't deny that
your union with Francis

03:19.833 --> 03:21.600
has been ill-fated.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.969
His alliance with you
has cost us everything.

03:23.971 --> 03:25.837
The war in Scotland
will be over soon.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.639
French troops
will be returning home.

03:27.641 --> 03:28.774
Don't be naive.

03:28.776 --> 03:29.942
I've been to English court.

03:29.944 --> 03:31.343
Their resources are vast.

03:31.345 --> 03:33.545
Elizabeth's grudge is personal.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.681
She can escalate
this war indefinitely.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.216
France cannot.

03:37.218 --> 03:38.483
I am just as strong

03:38.485 --> 03:39.618
and as stubborn as Elizabeth.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.386
I will not live in fear of her.

03:41.388 --> 03:42.654
I will marry Charles.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.223
Our union is our best hope...

03:44.225 --> 03:46.491
I am the best hope
of a stable France,

03:46.493 --> 03:47.826
of protecting my family.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.561
As regent.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.929
That's what
you've always wanted.

03:50.931 --> 03:52.831
Not just to sit
on a throne, but to rule.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.300
All I have ever wanted was
to protect my children.

03:55.302 --> 03:57.836
Let me protect them
while I still can.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.304
Let me help him.

03:59.306 --> 04:00.772
Francis doesn't want your help.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.975
None of your children
want your help.

04:02.977 --> 04:05.277
You vampire bitch!

04:05.279 --> 04:06.445
Let me out of these restraints!

04:06.447 --> 04:07.646
Nurse?

04:07.648 --> 04:09.514
Nurse!

04:09.516 --> 04:11.516
Drag her back to her cell.
(gasping, growling)

04:11.518 --> 04:12.584
If she tries to bite
anything else,

04:12.586 --> 04:13.986
shove a bit in her mouth.

04:13.988 --> 04:15.654
(yells)
(door closes)

04:18.592 --> 04:20.792
You actually went
to see my mother?

04:20.794 --> 04:22.694
What did she say?

04:22.696 --> 04:24.563
Oh, the usual.

04:24.565 --> 04:26.798
She should be regent,
I'm sucking France dry.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.668
Prettiest vampire
I've ever seen.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.337
There are so many things

04:32.339 --> 04:33.872
I wish we'd done together:

04:33.874 --> 04:37.743
eating oranges freshly plucked
from the trees in Nice,

04:37.745 --> 04:40.279
dancing under the stars
at the Louvre.

04:40.281 --> 04:41.880
Well, we were married there.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.882
Ah. So many ceremonies,

04:43.884 --> 04:46.685
so many nobles,
and we barely got to dance.

04:47.755 --> 04:49.821
We will do all those things.

04:50.891 --> 04:51.890
We will.

04:51.892 --> 04:53.492
(door opens)

04:54.561 --> 04:57.029
Brother.
Francis.

04:57.031 --> 04:59.364
(chuckles) You look like hell.

04:59.366 --> 05:01.500
What are you still doing here?

05:01.502 --> 05:03.302
Shouldn't you be looking
for that killer-- Delphine?

05:03.304 --> 05:04.503
I hear that

05:04.505 --> 05:05.704
her last two victims

05:05.706 --> 05:06.772
had their hearts cut out.

05:06.774 --> 05:08.340
I'm not certain
Delphine is guilty

05:08.342 --> 05:09.741
of those atrocities.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.043
But she is a suspect.

05:11.045 --> 05:13.345
My men are searching
for her day and night.

05:13.347 --> 05:15.547
In the meantime,
I'm not leaving your side.

05:16.517 --> 05:17.616
What is it then?

05:17.618 --> 05:19.017
I know that look.

05:19.019 --> 05:20.485
It's the one that you get
before a fight.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.754
King Antoine of Navarre

05:22.756 --> 05:24.690
has requested permission
to enter court.

05:24.692 --> 05:25.891
Antoine?
Is he alone?

05:25.893 --> 05:27.426
He's not here with an army,

05:27.428 --> 05:28.560
and he's not here
with his brother,

05:28.562 --> 05:30.629
if that's what
you're asking.

05:30.631 --> 05:31.963
Condé's whereabouts
are still unknown.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.632
What is he doing here now?

05:33.634 --> 05:35.934
Perhaps he's learned
of my illness.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.402
As a Bourbon, Antoine
has the best claim

05:37.404 --> 05:39.371
to the throne after Charles.

05:39.373 --> 05:40.906
If he rallies
his Protestant supporters,

05:40.908 --> 05:42.908
he could replace Charles
as king.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.042
We don't know
that's why he's here.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.444
Francis.

05:45.446 --> 05:46.645
Let me handle him.

05:46.647 --> 05:47.846
Bash, I know
that you blame him

05:47.848 --> 05:49.047
for what happened with Kenna,

05:49.049 --> 05:50.115
but you will not

05:50.117 --> 05:52.050
"handle" the king of Navarre.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.052
In fact, you'll stay
well away from him.

05:55.389 --> 05:56.555
Francis, please don't.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.590
Antoine can't see you like this.

05:58.592 --> 05:59.858
I'll find out
why he's here.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.593
<i>I</i> will talk to him.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.629
Grant him entrance.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.733
I can't accept this.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.101
It's too extravagant.

06:09.103 --> 06:10.869
Not for me; I'm a princess.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.037
Try it on.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.572
What, here?
Don't be modest.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.006
I want to see
how it looks on you.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.784
(chuckles) Oh,

06:25.786 --> 06:27.119
it's perfect!

06:27.121 --> 06:28.920
I really do have
an abundance of good taste.

06:30.391 --> 06:31.590
It feels good to share it
with a commoner.

06:31.592 --> 06:32.758
I'm glad I entertain you.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.493
I mean it.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.395
You lift my spirits.

06:36.397 --> 06:37.896
It's been so difficult

06:37.898 --> 06:39.931
watching my brother get worse.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.600
Princess, the
king of Navarre.

06:42.603 --> 06:43.902
Ugh, my work never ends.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.504
Leith, I expect you
to be wearing that

06:45.506 --> 06:46.671
when we play cards tonight.

06:50.611 --> 06:53.011
Greetings, Your Majesty.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.913
I've been sent to welcome you
by the king and queen.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.015
A meager royal reception,

06:57.017 --> 06:58.016
but a lovely one.

06:58.018 --> 07:00.419
Please, take me to them.

07:00.421 --> 07:02.454
Are you going to just
stand there?

07:02.456 --> 07:03.522
There's royal luggage
to unload.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.772
Queen Mary.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.008
Where is the king?

07:23.010 --> 07:24.843
He does not wish
to see you, Antoine.

07:24.845 --> 07:27.512
He associates you
with your brother's treason.

07:27.514 --> 07:30.048
I was never involved in Louis'
plans to seize the throne.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.717
I come in peace.

07:32.719 --> 07:33.885
Why?

07:33.887 --> 07:35.654
To trade for my brother's life.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.589
Louis has been captured
by mercenaries

07:37.591 --> 07:39.157
in the mountain village
of Chamonix.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.593
I'm willing to pay the ransom,
but his only path home

07:41.595 --> 07:43.061
is a remote mountain pass
controlled

07:43.063 --> 07:44.763
by your king's forces.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.665
I'm here to negotiate
for Louis' safe passage.

07:46.667 --> 07:47.933
I will not let

07:47.935 --> 07:50.202
my brother die
in those mountains.

07:50.204 --> 07:52.637
Condé is a traitor

07:52.639 --> 07:54.639
and deserves to die in France.

07:54.641 --> 07:57.042
You are asking that he live
his life in luxury in Navarre.

07:57.044 --> 07:59.544
Why on earth
should we grant him this?

07:59.546 --> 08:01.680
Because I have something
to offer you in return.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.683
I will convert
to Catholicism,

08:04.685 --> 08:07.819
and I will credit
my conversion to you.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.120
In doing so,

08:09.122 --> 08:11.056
any alliance I have with England

08:11.058 --> 08:12.757
will be destroyed.

08:12.759 --> 08:14.860
If you want Condé to live,

08:14.862 --> 08:18.063
it will cost you
much more than that.

08:19.700 --> 08:22.200
You will renounce
your family's claim

08:22.202 --> 08:23.835
to the French throne.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.570
(laughs)

08:27.107 --> 08:28.773
You can't be serious.

08:28.775 --> 08:30.275
If you really love your brother,

08:30.277 --> 08:32.944
and your intentions are sincere,
what's the issue?

08:32.946 --> 08:36.248
Giving up my claim means
giving up my supporters,

08:36.250 --> 08:37.949
the men who keep me in power.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.951
France will keep you in power,
and Condé will live.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.120
I will not even consider this
until I've spoken with Francis.

08:42.122 --> 08:43.922
As queen I can negotiate
on his behalf.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.624
Have I been too subtle?

08:45.626 --> 08:48.193
I have no interest
in negotiating with you.

08:48.195 --> 08:51.096
You are a dangerous
and duplicitous woman,

08:51.098 --> 08:53.031
and you destroyed my brother.

08:53.033 --> 08:56.101
Why are you trying to blame
a woman for a man's choices?

08:56.103 --> 08:59.938
It was Condé's decision alone
to start a revolution.

08:59.940 --> 09:02.574
It was his love for you
that fueled his ambition.

09:02.576 --> 09:04.042
You swore that you loved him,

09:04.044 --> 09:05.210
that you'd spend
your lives together,

09:05.212 --> 09:06.978
and then you stabbed him
in the gut

09:06.980 --> 09:08.780
and threw him in a dungeon.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.851
I think
you've done enough, Mary.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.586
I will only speak
with the king.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.859
How do I look?

09:20.861 --> 09:22.661
Well, you look well enough.

09:22.663 --> 09:25.130
Are you sure you're able
to negotiate in person?

09:25.132 --> 09:27.198
If it means putting an end
to the Bourbon threat

09:27.200 --> 09:29.234
and keeping you and Charles
safe after I'm gone,

09:29.236 --> 09:31.136
I'll do anything.

09:31.138 --> 09:32.938
Though I do hope Antoine
is serious

09:32.940 --> 09:34.139
about signing
away his claim.

09:34.141 --> 09:35.874
He is.

09:35.876 --> 09:38.076
I know how much he
cares about Condé.

09:38.078 --> 09:41.012
And I've seen Antoine choose to
protect him time and time again.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.286
What is it?

09:48.288 --> 09:51.823
This feels like it did
in the beginning:

09:51.825 --> 09:54.359
like we can do anything
together.

09:55.629 --> 09:56.895
I'm ready.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.870
Francis? Francis!

10:05.872 --> 10:06.905
No, no, no, no, no.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.106
Guards!

10:08.108 --> 10:10.041
Guards!

10:10.043 --> 10:11.910
Francis...
Francis, come on.

10:11.912 --> 10:14.913
Take him upstairs
before anyone sees him.

10:14.915 --> 10:16.982
Quickly! Quickly!

10:27.995 --> 10:29.728
He's gone.

10:29.730 --> 10:33.264
And now you have
nothing to fear...

10:33.266 --> 10:35.033
except me.

10:35.035 --> 10:37.035
If only that were true.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.903
I'm still having nightmares
about that rat

10:38.905 --> 10:40.805
Catherine planted
in my bath.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.407
Catherine is locked away.

10:42.409 --> 10:45.944
And even if she escaped,
I'd protect you.

10:45.946 --> 10:48.146
Mmm.

10:48.148 --> 10:52.283
Mmm...

10:52.285 --> 10:54.285
So from now on,

10:54.287 --> 10:57.155
you are only allowed
to dream about me.

10:57.157 --> 11:00.959
As you wish, Lord Narcisse.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.994
Lola.
Hmm?

11:02.996 --> 11:04.763
I want something.

11:04.765 --> 11:07.966
Well, whatever it is,
the answer is yes.

11:07.968 --> 11:10.969
I want to know
what your plans are

11:10.971 --> 11:12.404
when we can be together,

11:12.406 --> 11:15.840
since Francis has forbidden
our union.

11:16.843 --> 11:19.844
(sighs)

11:19.846 --> 11:22.247
Now I really want to know.

11:22.249 --> 11:25.917
You just need to trust me
and be patient.

11:25.919 --> 11:28.386
Are you sure?

11:28.388 --> 11:32.724
I have had years of experience
scheming and plotting.

11:32.726 --> 11:35.126
Please, stop.

11:35.128 --> 11:39.731
Ah... all right.

11:39.733 --> 11:42.133
But I shall need...

11:42.135 --> 11:44.135
something in return--

11:44.137 --> 11:47.272
a sign of your
good intentions.

11:47.274 --> 11:49.007
Right here...

11:49.009 --> 11:52.711
on this...
delicate little finger.

11:55.282 --> 11:57.148
Lola...

11:57.150 --> 12:01.152
when the time is right...

12:01.154 --> 12:04.255
will you marry me?

12:04.257 --> 12:07.992
To marry you
is to defy my king,

12:07.994 --> 12:10.795
to risk Catherine's wrath
and the judgment

12:10.797 --> 12:13.498
of my friends,
and yet...

12:13.500 --> 12:17.001
you make me feel stronger
than I've ever felt before.

12:17.003 --> 12:20.105
I can't believe
I'm saying this, but...

12:20.107 --> 12:24.109
yes-- yes, I will marry you.

12:24.111 --> 12:28.346
¶ I found love where it wasn't ¶

12:28.348 --> 12:30.882
¶ Supposed to be ¶

12:30.884 --> 12:33.151
Someday...

12:33.153 --> 12:34.953
I will.
But for now,

12:34.955 --> 12:38.456
we must keep it a secret.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.292
For now.

12:41.294 --> 12:47.432
¶ ...love where it wasn't
supposed to be... ¶

12:48.435 --> 12:50.435
CHARLES:
<i> Constance,</i>

12:50.437 --> 12:52.036
we had quite a time
in Milan last summer.

12:52.038 --> 12:53.505
It was brilliant.

12:53.507 --> 12:56.241
Remember the party at
Lord Francesco's castle?

12:56.243 --> 12:59.043
You and I drank
so much wine.

12:59.045 --> 13:01.179
If only it had
just been you and I.

13:01.181 --> 13:04.449
Sadly, your friends never seemed
to let you out of their sight.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.850
Well...

13:05.852 --> 13:08.319
my friends aren't here now.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.054
What's happening
at court tonight?

13:10.056 --> 13:12.223
Anything exciting?
Tonight?

13:12.225 --> 13:13.958
We'll have
after-dinner festivities.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.527
The King of Navarre
will be attending.

13:15.529 --> 13:17.862
Dreadfully boring.
I know.

13:17.864 --> 13:19.531
It'll be terrible.

13:19.533 --> 13:21.833
But I can find
something exciting.

13:21.835 --> 13:24.169
Hmm. I'll leave it up
to you then.

13:27.474 --> 13:30.475
The drug's powers are
miraculous, Your Majesty.

13:30.477 --> 13:35.880
Opium will relieve your pain for
hours and even bring euphoria.

13:35.882 --> 13:39.217
Thank you. But I've heard
the drug can be unpredictable

13:39.219 --> 13:41.085
and dangerously abused.

13:41.087 --> 13:43.488
Hm. I only have one chance
with Antoine.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.089
I need my mind to be sharp.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.827
I can do this.

13:48.829 --> 13:50.829
I just need rest.
Well,

13:50.831 --> 13:54.399
in case you reconsider.

13:54.401 --> 13:56.367
CHARLES:
Francis,

13:56.369 --> 13:58.169
do I have to attend
the festivities tonight?

13:58.171 --> 14:00.438
It would be good
to have you there.
It's-it's just

14:00.440 --> 14:02.240
I have already promised
the Duke of Toulouse

14:02.242 --> 14:04.008
I'd play cards
with him tonight.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.276
It would be rude of me
to cancel.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.045
He's a very important man.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.480
Well, if you finish in time,
come and join us.

14:09.482 --> 14:13.351
I'll do my best. Though I expect
our game to run rather late.

14:28.235 --> 14:30.101
Are you sure
you can do this, Francis?

14:30.103 --> 14:32.203
Mary told me about what
happened on the stairs.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.404
You must be in so much pain.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.006
I appreciate
your concern,

14:35.008 --> 14:36.875
though I do wonder
if it's genuine.

14:36.877 --> 14:38.943
What?
Since my mother
lost her power,

14:38.945 --> 14:40.912
I have inherited her network
of spies.

14:40.914 --> 14:42.413
One of them
saw you leaving

14:42.415 --> 14:44.315
Narcisse's chambers
this morning.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.986
So it's true.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.988
After I forbade Narcisse
from courting you.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.390
Francis, I'm in love with him.
For what,

14:52.392 --> 14:54.559
his honesty? His loyalty
to his king and crown?

14:54.561 --> 14:55.960
I'm not a fool.

14:55.962 --> 14:58.329
I know he's done awful things.

14:58.331 --> 15:01.266
But there are other sides to him
that you don't see. There is...

15:01.268 --> 15:04.335
goodness in him, kindness.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.304
He makes me happy.

15:06.306 --> 15:09.474
So you're going to marry him
after I'm dead.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.976
That's what you're trying
to tell me, in so many words.

15:11.978 --> 15:14.379
Lola, you're not
the first person to tell me

15:14.381 --> 15:17.382
that I can't control things
after I'm gone.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.951
So I am asking you,

15:19.953 --> 15:22.587
not as your king
but as John's father...

15:24.190 --> 15:27.525
...please don't marry him.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.661
When I'm gone, John

15:29.663 --> 15:32.196
won't remember me.

15:32.198 --> 15:34.065
He'll never feel my love.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.400
(crying)

15:35.402 --> 15:37.502
He needs

15:37.504 --> 15:38.937
a man in his life

15:38.939 --> 15:41.005
(crying)
to protect him,

15:41.007 --> 15:43.341
to guide him, to show
him right from wrong.

15:44.511 --> 15:47.278
Narcisse is not that man.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.149
I understand.

15:51.151 --> 15:54.218
And... I will consider
your wishes, I promise.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.155
(door opens)
Francis,

15:57.157 --> 15:58.456
it's time.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.232
(crying)

16:12.105 --> 16:14.505
(crying, sobbing)

16:17.077 --> 16:21.212
(soft music playing)
(Antoine chuckles)

16:21.214 --> 16:24.115
You're quite enchanting,
aren't you?

16:24.117 --> 16:26.651
Tell me, have you seen
the king?

16:26.653 --> 16:29.187
Oh, I don't think
he's arrived yet.

16:34.227 --> 16:35.626
Here's our chance.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.061
The seat beside him is empty.

16:37.063 --> 16:39.497
MAN:
Musicians!

16:39.499 --> 16:40.999
(music stops)

16:41.001 --> 16:44.235
Dancing music
for the king and queen!

16:44.237 --> 16:47.005
Francis, we don't have to.
I'll make an excuse.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.208
No. I want to dance with you.

16:50.210 --> 16:53.277
(soft song begins)
Can you do this?

16:54.347 --> 16:56.080
If we're here
to put on a show,

16:56.082 --> 16:57.715
what better way than this?

16:59.619 --> 17:05.423
¶ ¶

17:11.031 --> 17:13.297
You're leading.

17:13.299 --> 17:15.500
Just keep your
eyes on me.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.735
¶ ¶

17:23.710 --> 17:24.709
(gasps)

17:24.711 --> 17:27.512
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

17:27.514 --> 17:31.082
¶ ¶

17:42.729 --> 17:44.562
What is it?

17:46.800 --> 17:48.232
You'll have to excuse me.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.641
Let's slip away from here.

17:56.643 --> 17:59.077
I want to feel
your skin against mine.

18:00.780 --> 18:01.813
LOLA: Francis knows.

18:01.815 --> 18:04.816
That is a problem.

18:04.818 --> 18:06.751
We'll find
a solution.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.420
¶ ¶

18:17.797 --> 18:21.532
Stephan, I can't do this.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.134
What do you mean?

18:23.136 --> 18:25.436
LOLA:
It's strange. So long

18:25.438 --> 18:27.438
I've resented that my life
belonged to a king.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.675
But now I realize my life
really belongs to my son.

18:30.677 --> 18:33.678
I have to think
about what's best for him.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.313
I'm not sure

18:35.315 --> 18:36.647
that's you.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.816
I have raised children
of my own, you know.

18:38.818 --> 18:41.619
Some of them turned
out quite well.

18:42.555 --> 18:43.788
(groans quietly)

18:48.128 --> 18:50.661
I swear that I will help

18:50.663 --> 18:54.532
you and Francis raise
your son with honor.

18:54.534 --> 18:57.535
Do you doubt me?

18:57.537 --> 19:01.606
As long as Francis
has doubts, so will I.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.787
I had them clear out
this room just for us.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.656
Do you like it?

19:18.658 --> 19:22.193
It's just like the
wine cellar in Tuscany.

19:22.195 --> 19:24.228
We had quite a
night, didn't we?

19:24.230 --> 19:26.731
Until you went off
with Lorenzo.

19:29.369 --> 19:32.837
So, what do
you want to do?

19:34.207 --> 19:36.741
Um...

19:36.743 --> 19:38.543
Is that what
I think it is?

19:38.545 --> 19:40.444
(chuckles)
Charles!

19:40.446 --> 19:43.247
I've never actually
tried it before.

19:43.249 --> 19:44.248
Shall we smoke it?

19:44.250 --> 19:45.616
No need, darling.

19:50.190 --> 19:51.322
To us.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.597
(chuckles)

20:02.702 --> 20:04.502
That's all?

20:04.504 --> 20:05.770
(chuckles)

20:07.907 --> 20:09.473
Mmm.

20:09.475 --> 20:11.809
Have some of me then.

20:14.781 --> 20:15.780
(glass shatters)

20:15.782 --> 20:17.615
(laughing)

20:23.323 --> 20:25.790
(gagging)

20:25.792 --> 20:27.658
Constance, are
you all right?

20:27.660 --> 20:29.393
(gagging, gasping)

20:31.397 --> 20:34.432
Constance!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

20:34.434 --> 20:35.866
Constance, please,
you have to wake up!

20:35.868 --> 20:37.235
(panting anxiously)

20:43.009 --> 20:46.377
What do you mean she might
be dead?
How am I to know?
Haven't you smoked it before?

20:46.379 --> 20:49.614
That's why you came to me?
What do you expect me to do?

20:49.616 --> 20:51.849
Constance's father's
a duke.

20:51.851 --> 20:54.619
If she dies here
in the castle...

20:54.621 --> 20:56.621
God, I wish Mother were here.

20:56.623 --> 20:58.923
She manages tragedy
with ruthless clarity.

21:00.493 --> 21:02.560
Actually, there-there is someone

21:02.562 --> 21:04.295
who shares mother's talents...

21:04.297 --> 21:06.497
I will not help you with this.
Why not?

21:06.499 --> 21:07.832
You have to.

21:07.834 --> 21:10.301
The king mistrusts me
enough as it is.

21:10.303 --> 21:11.702
I can't get involved
in hiding

21:11.704 --> 21:13.638
the death of a noble girl.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.707
She is actually dead,
isn't she?

21:16.709 --> 21:18.776
CHARLES:
Her eyes rolled
back in her head.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.845
What is it?
She's still
breathing.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.613
Barely, but she's alive.

21:24.851 --> 21:26.450
How long
has she been like this?

21:26.452 --> 21:27.685
I'm not sure.
Ten minutes?

21:27.687 --> 21:30.655
Charles, fetch me
a bucket of water.

21:30.657 --> 21:32.056
You want me,
the Dauphin,

21:32.058 --> 21:33.457
to get you a
bucket of water?

21:33.459 --> 21:34.859
You want to save her life,

21:34.861 --> 21:36.394
then we need to flush

21:36.396 --> 21:38.596
the drug from her body
before her heart stops.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.431
Now fetch me that bucket!

21:40.433 --> 21:41.799
And some
kind of tube.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.934
A tube?

21:55.081 --> 21:57.448
Your Majesty,
you received my invitation.

21:57.450 --> 21:59.016
What was so urgent?

21:59.018 --> 22:01.752
I've learned of your
negotiations with the Valois.

22:01.754 --> 22:04.355
So disappointing
after the wrongs they've done

22:04.357 --> 22:06.023
to your noble family.

22:06.025 --> 22:07.525
You have a counteroffer?

22:07.527 --> 22:09.527
Don't sign away your claim
to the French throne

22:09.529 --> 22:11.362
and England will make it
worth your while

22:11.364 --> 22:13.097
with gold and military support.

22:13.099 --> 22:15.099
And if France retaliates
against my country?

22:15.101 --> 22:17.501
They won't.
They can't afford it.

22:17.503 --> 22:19.770
I came here to save
my brother's life.

22:19.772 --> 22:21.038
With the roads under
French control,

22:21.040 --> 22:22.373
he can't get back
into Navarre.

22:22.375 --> 22:23.574
If I don't sign
away my claim,

22:23.576 --> 22:24.775
he will die.

22:24.777 --> 22:27.044
Condé is an anchor
around your neck.

22:27.046 --> 22:28.979
Let him go.

22:28.981 --> 22:30.514
You are a king.

22:30.516 --> 22:32.683
Of a small nation, to be sure.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.785
Which is why you,
more than your brother,

22:34.787 --> 22:36.954
want the French throne.

22:36.956 --> 22:38.456
And you can have it,

22:38.458 --> 22:39.557
with England behind you

22:39.559 --> 22:40.791
to make good on your claim

22:40.793 --> 22:42.927
when the opportunity
presents itself.

22:42.929 --> 22:44.862
France could one day be yours.

22:46.599 --> 22:48.733
We'll need a decision
before dawn.

22:52.004 --> 22:54.538
(laughter,
indistinct conversations)

22:54.540 --> 22:56.140
Where the hell is Antoine?

22:56.142 --> 22:58.409
He asked to negotiate
with me in person

22:58.411 --> 22:59.977
and then, suddenly,
he just disappears?

22:59.979 --> 23:02.613
Apparently he received a
message and then he rushed off.

23:02.615 --> 23:04.615
A message from who?
I don't know.

23:04.617 --> 23:06.450
Greer had one of her
girls watching him,

23:06.452 --> 23:08.586
but unfortunately the
poor thing can't read.

23:08.588 --> 23:11.655
Antoine was willing
to negotiate with me, so...

23:11.657 --> 23:13.758
something in that message
changed his mind.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.393
I'll find out what happened.

23:17.964 --> 23:21.098
Talk to the rest of your ladies
who were on duty tonight.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.067
Find out if anyone knows
what Antoine has been up to

23:23.069 --> 23:24.702
since he left the festivities.

23:24.704 --> 23:26.003
You needn't bother.

23:27.607 --> 23:28.806
Sebastian.
I know you ordered me

23:28.808 --> 23:30.007
to stay away from Antoine.

23:30.009 --> 23:31.475
You've been following him.

23:31.477 --> 23:32.476
Yes. And I saw him take

23:32.478 --> 23:33.577
a private meeting with Nicholas.

23:33.579 --> 23:35.079
The English ambassador.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.680
I was too far away
to hear their conversation,

23:36.682 --> 23:38.015
but I think we can assume
that England

23:38.017 --> 23:40.017
made an offer that Antoine
couldn't refuse.

23:40.019 --> 23:42.620
Then we have to force England
to rescind that offer.

23:42.622 --> 23:43.921
And how will you manage that?

23:46.626 --> 23:48.626
You said that you could
still help your children.

23:48.628 --> 23:51.195
Now it's time
for you to prove it.

24:01.474 --> 24:03.607
You must be Nicholas.

24:03.609 --> 24:05.009
How did you get in here?

24:05.011 --> 24:06.577
I'm Catherine de Medici,

24:06.579 --> 24:07.878
Queen Mother of France.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.513
Maybe you've heard of me.

24:09.515 --> 24:10.514
I heard you were locked away

24:10.516 --> 24:11.982
in the dungeons by your own son.

24:11.984 --> 24:13.517
And I heard
that you made an offer

24:13.519 --> 24:15.152
to the king of Navarre.

24:15.154 --> 24:17.521
You will withdraw it
immediately.

24:17.523 --> 24:19.523
I know Elizabeth likes
having a friend in Navarre

24:19.525 --> 24:21.625
with a claim to our throne.

24:21.627 --> 24:22.893
A king who could

24:22.895 --> 24:24.462
one day take over France.

24:24.464 --> 24:27.031
I will never let that happen.

24:27.033 --> 24:29.033
And Elizabeth
will never give up Navarre.

24:29.035 --> 24:30.501
Yes, she will.

24:30.503 --> 24:32.536
Because I have
something to trade:

24:32.538 --> 24:33.904
my silence.

24:33.906 --> 24:36.173
I was at English court
when Elizabeth

24:36.175 --> 24:39.210
sanctioned a conspiracy
against Mary.

24:39.212 --> 24:41.745
And I can tell the whole world

24:41.747 --> 24:44.682
how your Virgin Queen and I
conspired together,

24:44.684 --> 24:48.219
with her lover Dudley
panting in the wings.

24:48.221 --> 24:50.521
That would be
disastrous for her.

24:50.523 --> 24:53.190
She's gone to a great deal
of trouble to cover it all up.

24:53.192 --> 24:56.694
By accusing her, you'd implicate
yourself as a traitor to France.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.162
Your own son
would be forced

24:58.164 --> 25:00.097
to execute you for treason.

25:00.099 --> 25:02.900
You don't know me, Englishman.

25:02.902 --> 25:05.102
I don't have much
to live for these days.

25:05.104 --> 25:06.937
But I can still die
for my children.

25:06.939 --> 25:08.706
Withdraw your offer,

25:08.708 --> 25:10.007
or I will burn

25:10.009 --> 25:12.076
Elizabeth's name to the ground.

25:18.818 --> 25:19.984
Open her mouth,
hold the tube in place.

25:19.986 --> 25:22.520
Not you. Charles.

25:22.522 --> 25:24.788
Why me?
Because you
are responsible for this.

25:24.790 --> 25:26.857
She took something you gave her
because she trusted you,

25:26.859 --> 25:28.893
so now you're gonna
make this right.

25:28.895 --> 25:30.227
Now put the tube
in her mouth!

25:33.299 --> 25:34.865
I need a funnel.

25:36.302 --> 25:37.268
(gasps)

25:39.305 --> 25:41.071
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

25:41.073 --> 25:42.172
It's been years
since I found myself

25:42.174 --> 25:43.173
in an opium den, but...

25:43.175 --> 25:44.608
But you've done this before?

25:44.610 --> 25:47.011
Never. Claude, the funnel.
Hold it steady.

25:47.013 --> 25:49.680
Keep the tube all the way
down until I give word.

25:53.920 --> 25:54.985
Narcisse.

25:54.987 --> 25:56.587
Not yet.

25:56.589 --> 25:58.556
Is this supposed to happen?

25:58.558 --> 26:00.624
I think she's dying!
Hold it.

26:00.626 --> 26:02.693
Now. Pull it out now.

26:02.695 --> 26:04.261
(gurgles, retches)

26:04.263 --> 26:06.964
Constance.

26:06.966 --> 26:09.033
Are you all right?

26:10.069 --> 26:11.802
Good.
(shrieking)

26:12.872 --> 26:14.138
(sobbing)

26:14.140 --> 26:16.140
There, there.
You're fine.

26:16.142 --> 26:18.075
Here, Charles. Come on.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.743
Get her cleaned up
and back to her chambers.

26:19.745 --> 26:22.112
You may not be king,

26:22.114 --> 26:24.081
but your actions
reflect on Francis,

26:24.083 --> 26:25.883
and he has the weight

26:25.885 --> 26:27.618
of thousands of lives,
just like this one,

26:27.620 --> 26:29.119
on his shoulders.

26:29.121 --> 26:30.688
Be wiser next time.

26:35.094 --> 26:38.195
That girl is alive
because of your quick thinking.

26:39.265 --> 26:41.332
Well done.

26:43.636 --> 26:46.770
Leith, you'll never believe...

26:46.772 --> 26:49.306
Claude! Uh, w-what
are you doing here?

26:49.308 --> 26:50.641
Alexandra?

26:50.643 --> 26:51.842
Dear Lord!

26:54.046 --> 26:55.112
Claude!

26:55.114 --> 26:57.748
Claude, wait! Wait!

26:57.750 --> 26:59.717
What?

26:59.719 --> 27:02.987
Uh... I'm sorry
that you had to see that.

27:02.989 --> 27:03.988
Don't apologize.

27:03.990 --> 27:06.056
I should have knocked.

27:06.058 --> 27:08.225
I don't understand this.

27:08.227 --> 27:10.995
I thought you were
heartbroken over Greer.

27:10.997 --> 27:13.697
When did you decide to take up
with one of my ladies?

27:13.699 --> 27:16.000
Recently.
How recently?

27:16.002 --> 27:17.801
And why her?

27:17.803 --> 27:19.803
It's very confusing
being your friend,

27:19.805 --> 27:23.207
so instead of doing something
foolish, I did this.

27:23.209 --> 27:25.943
What do you mean,
something foolish?

27:25.945 --> 27:27.945
Something with me?

27:27.947 --> 27:30.280
I fell in love with a woman
above my station before.

27:30.282 --> 27:31.715
It was torture.

27:31.717 --> 27:33.350
I'll never
make that mistake again.

27:33.352 --> 27:35.085
You thought you might
fall in love with me?

27:35.087 --> 27:37.087
No, I thought
that this cannot happen.

27:37.089 --> 27:38.222
Fine, fine, fine.

27:38.224 --> 27:40.290
Could you just repeat the part

27:40.292 --> 27:42.292
about realizing
you had feelings for me?

27:50.870 --> 27:53.270
You wanted to see me,
Your Majesty?

27:53.272 --> 27:54.772
You don't look well.

27:54.774 --> 27:57.007
Are you feeling all right?

27:57.009 --> 27:58.976
I've been fasting.
I was just in Reims

27:58.978 --> 28:00.844
for seclusion and prayer.

28:00.846 --> 28:02.246
Oh.
I know what happened

28:02.248 --> 28:03.747
with Charles.

28:03.749 --> 28:06.417
King Francis, if I may...
You may not.

28:06.419 --> 28:07.851
Not a word.

28:09.455 --> 28:11.455
Charles came to me
because he made a mistake

28:11.457 --> 28:14.391
and felt terrible about it.

28:14.393 --> 28:16.360
That is quite a change.

28:16.362 --> 28:19.029
I've been trying
to get through to him

28:19.031 --> 28:22.933
for weeks and somehow
you reached him.

28:22.935 --> 28:24.802
You challenged him

28:24.804 --> 28:26.470
to take responsibility,
and he listened.

28:26.472 --> 28:30.007
I'm confused about the nature
of this conversation.

28:31.811 --> 28:34.211
Lola tried to convince me
that there was more to you

28:34.213 --> 28:36.747
than treachery and greed.

28:36.749 --> 28:38.415
I didn't
want to hear it.

28:38.417 --> 28:42.052
But the measure of a man is what
he does when no one is looking.

28:42.054 --> 28:46.056
Perhaps you still have
some honor to impart.

28:47.727 --> 28:50.928
Are you offering me
your gratitude?

28:50.930 --> 28:53.063
I'm offering you
my blessing with Lola.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.765
To court her?

28:54.767 --> 28:56.133
To marry her.

28:56.135 --> 28:58.335
As long as
you do so quickly.

28:58.337 --> 29:00.270
In the interest
of Lola's reputation.

29:00.272 --> 29:02.172
Gossip is already
spreading about the two of you,

29:02.174 --> 29:03.874
and I will not
have Lola mistaken

29:03.876 --> 29:05.175
for another
one of your conquests.

29:05.177 --> 29:06.877
No. Uh...

29:06.879 --> 29:08.011
I will attend, of course.

29:08.013 --> 29:09.446
To publicly sanction this union.

29:09.448 --> 29:11.482
Francis.
Mary needs you.

29:11.484 --> 29:13.283
She's found Antoine.

29:18.324 --> 29:19.757
(door opens)

29:21.327 --> 29:23.227
Antoine.

29:23.229 --> 29:26.897
Thought you'd retired
for the evening.

29:26.899 --> 29:28.232
My apologies, cousin.

29:28.234 --> 29:30.167
We know you're here
to meet Nicholas.

29:30.169 --> 29:31.468
He's not coming.

29:31.470 --> 29:32.592
You no longer have

29:32.593 --> 29:33.715
an alliance with England.

29:33.716 --> 29:34.838
Only one path remains.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.540
Sign away your claim
to my throne, right now,

29:36.542 --> 29:39.276
and I will make sure that
your brother comes home alive.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.545
I give you
my assurance as king,

29:41.547 --> 29:43.814
France will protect you.

29:43.816 --> 29:45.415
(stifled groan)

29:45.417 --> 29:47.484
King Francis...

29:47.486 --> 29:49.153
(gasps)
Francis?

29:51.257 --> 29:52.823
I'm all right.

29:53.559 --> 29:54.958
No you're not, you're sick.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.393
That's why you've barely
been at court.

29:56.395 --> 29:57.995
They've been hiding you away.

29:57.997 --> 29:59.496
Sign it.

29:59.498 --> 30:00.998
You're in such a rush
for me to sign tonight.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.167
It's not because you're ill.
Are you dying?

30:03.169 --> 30:04.868
Francis is recovering.
ANTOINE: Enough!

30:04.870 --> 30:06.837
I can't be expected
to sign away my claim

30:06.839 --> 30:09.072
to a dying king.
It's true.

30:10.242 --> 30:11.408
I'm dying.

30:11.410 --> 30:13.177
But a dying king
is capable of anything.

30:13.179 --> 30:14.545
Antoine, I could kill you--

30:14.547 --> 30:16.180
right here--
I could march

30:16.182 --> 30:17.981
on Navarre and crush it.

30:17.983 --> 30:19.283
Are you threatening me with war?

30:19.285 --> 30:21.418
Now, your father
was a tyrant and a brute,

30:21.420 --> 30:22.886
but you're not
that kind of king.

30:22.888 --> 30:24.288
It's not in your nature.

30:24.290 --> 30:26.356
I'm going back to Navarre.

30:29.562 --> 30:31.461
My God.

30:35.434 --> 30:37.034
When I die,

30:37.036 --> 30:39.036
Mary and Charles will rule

30:39.038 --> 30:41.071
and you will not
rise against them.

30:41.073 --> 30:42.339
Have you gone mad?

30:42.341 --> 30:44.908
You misjudged me, Antoine.

30:44.910 --> 30:46.510
I'm my father's son.

30:48.147 --> 30:50.013
Sign away your claim

30:50.015 --> 30:52.149
or I will gather my forces
at your borders,

30:52.151 --> 30:54.918
ransack your cities,
pillage your gold--
I don't care

30:54.920 --> 30:56.920
if I have to run France
into the ground,

30:56.922 --> 30:58.322
I will take your country.

30:58.324 --> 31:00.057
Mary, convince your husband
to see sense.

31:00.059 --> 31:03.060
Remember why you came here--

31:03.062 --> 31:05.395
to save your brother,
to protect your family.

31:05.397 --> 31:09.166
Sign, please, before
you lose everything.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.484
I will abdicate my claim.

31:28.888 --> 31:31.388
Charles will rule.

31:38.530 --> 31:41.164
Another attack?
A young peasant woman
in the narrows.

31:41.166 --> 31:42.933
Stabbed in the chest.

31:42.935 --> 31:44.668
The woman's heart--
was it removed

31:44.670 --> 31:46.169
like the others?

31:46.171 --> 31:47.671
No, my lord.
She survived.

31:47.673 --> 31:49.640
Neighbors heard her scream
and rushed outside.

31:49.642 --> 31:51.408
The killer had already fled.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.110
But we have
a surviving witness.

31:53.112 --> 31:56.446
She's in a peasant house
in the village, unconscious.

31:56.448 --> 31:58.181
Shall I stand guard
until she wakes?

31:58.183 --> 32:01.051
I need to know what
this woman saw. I'll go myself.

32:01.053 --> 32:05.055
I know Charles's
behavior concerns you.

32:05.057 --> 32:07.057
Let me think.

32:07.059 --> 32:09.326
He's lied to our faces,
stolen opium,

32:09.328 --> 32:11.528
and endangered the life
of a young girl.

32:11.530 --> 32:14.531
Yes. Let's talk about it
after the wedding.

32:16.135 --> 32:17.935
Ambassador.

32:17.937 --> 32:19.269
Surprised
to see you here

32:19.271 --> 32:20.404
after your dealings
with Navarre.

32:20.406 --> 32:21.972
I was only
doing my job--

32:21.974 --> 32:23.373
protecting Elizabeth's
interests.

32:23.375 --> 32:25.142
No, I would call it spying.

32:25.144 --> 32:27.110
All diplomats
are spies.

32:27.112 --> 32:28.478
We trade in information.

32:28.480 --> 32:29.947
Your health, for example.

32:29.949 --> 32:31.481
My condolences, King Francis.

32:32.952 --> 32:34.151
What do you want?
Is Elizabeth

32:34.153 --> 32:36.486
also sending her condolences?
No,

32:36.488 --> 32:39.156
she's sending 6,000 peacekeepers
into Scotland.

32:39.158 --> 32:40.557
"Peacekeepers"?

32:40.559 --> 32:42.993
Is that what she's
calling her soldiers now?

32:42.995 --> 32:45.362
It has a pleasant,
nonaggressive ring to it,

32:45.364 --> 32:47.164
but they will crush
your supporters

32:47.166 --> 32:49.032
and your French forces
nonetheless.

32:49.034 --> 32:51.168
This is an act of war.

32:51.170 --> 32:54.271
We will not bow to the English,
not in France or in Scotland.

32:54.273 --> 32:55.539
Tell your queen that

32:55.541 --> 32:57.040
I will fight for Scotland

32:57.042 --> 32:58.241
until my last breath.

32:58.243 --> 33:01.111
¶ ¶

33:06.452 --> 33:09.619
I will not abandon your
country, Mary, I promise.

33:09.621 --> 33:11.722
We can't afford
to keep on fighting.

33:11.724 --> 33:14.524
We don't have the soldiers,
we don't have the gold.

33:16.261 --> 33:18.328
Catherine was right
about Elizabeth.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.330
She'll never retreat.

33:20.332 --> 33:22.532
I...
You haven't lost me yet.

33:26.238 --> 33:29.006
I'm still here, at your side.

33:30.342 --> 33:33.210
¶ I know that
I should not hold on ¶

33:33.212 --> 33:36.680
¶ So why can't I let go? ¶

33:36.682 --> 33:39.549
¶ 'Cause every time
I'm with you ¶

33:39.551 --> 33:43.754
¶ Somehow I forget to breathe ¶

33:43.756 --> 33:47.524
¶ You got me like a rag doll,
now I'm ¶

33:47.526 --> 33:49.226
¶ Dancing on your string ¶

33:49.228 --> 33:52.662
¶ And I keep trying ¶

33:52.664 --> 33:54.297
¶ To figure out ¶

33:54.299 --> 33:57.134
¶ Who you are to me ¶

33:57.136 --> 33:59.503
¶ But maybe all that ¶

33:59.505 --> 34:02.406
¶ We were meant to be ¶

34:02.408 --> 34:07.177
¶ Is beautifully unfinished ¶

34:07.179 --> 34:09.613
¶ 'Cause you're the one that ¶

34:09.615 --> 34:11.782
¶ I can't lose, you're the one ¶

34:11.784 --> 34:14.484
¶ That I can't win ¶

34:14.486 --> 34:17.354
¶ 'Cause every time
I'm with you ¶

34:17.356 --> 34:20.457
¶ Somehow I forget to breathe ¶

34:20.459 --> 34:23.727
¶ But maybe all that we ¶

34:23.729 --> 34:26.730
¶ Are meant to be ¶

34:26.732 --> 34:29.833
¶ Is beautifully unfinished. ¶

34:33.305 --> 34:35.839
(door opens)

34:35.841 --> 34:38.341
Mary, what are you
doing up here?

34:38.343 --> 34:40.811
Come back to the celebration.

34:42.648 --> 34:44.648
I can't marry Charles.

34:44.650 --> 34:48.285
I-I know that
you're worried about him,

34:48.287 --> 34:50.720
worried that France can't
sustain a prolonged war, but...

34:50.722 --> 34:53.390
the alliance...
The alliance is not

34:53.392 --> 34:55.459
what has protected Scotland
all these years.

34:55.461 --> 34:57.594
It's you.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.696
It's your love for me.

35:01.433 --> 35:03.700
When you threatened Antoine
with war,

35:03.702 --> 35:06.570
I could see it in your eyes,
you meant it.

35:06.572 --> 35:08.839
There is nothing you
wouldn't do for me.

35:08.841 --> 35:11.141
How can I expect the same
of Charles?

35:11.143 --> 35:13.310
We don't know
what kind of king he'll be,

35:13.312 --> 35:14.444
what kind of man.

35:14.446 --> 35:17.314
He won't be you, Francis.

35:17.316 --> 35:19.883
He won't have your heart--
he won't have to take care

35:19.885 --> 35:21.485
of his own country.

35:21.487 --> 35:24.387
And France is weakening
with its king.

35:25.724 --> 35:27.457
And when you die...

35:27.459 --> 35:28.658
The alliance will die with me.

35:32.865 --> 35:36.299
(groaning quietly)

35:36.301 --> 35:39.503
If you don't marry Charles,
what will you do?

35:39.505 --> 35:42.205
Intelligence from Spain.

35:42.207 --> 35:43.907
(sniffles)

35:43.909 --> 35:46.776
Prince Don Carlos
is their next king,

35:46.778 --> 35:49.312
and according
to this message,

35:49.314 --> 35:51.548
he has begun
secretly looking for a wife.

35:52.851 --> 35:54.684
Ah.

35:56.355 --> 35:58.622
Spain has the strongest navy
in the world.

35:58.624 --> 36:00.757
It could protect Scotland.

36:00.759 --> 36:02.359
(sniffles)
I hate talking

36:02.361 --> 36:03.927
like this,
thinking like this.

36:03.929 --> 36:05.362
It's all right.

36:05.364 --> 36:06.796
I just need
to make sure that

36:06.798 --> 36:10.534
the ones that I love
are safe after I'm gone.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.203
If you leave France,

36:13.205 --> 36:15.438
someone else
will have to watch over Charles.

36:15.440 --> 36:18.175
Yes.

36:18.177 --> 36:20.911
Someone devoted
to the Valois line.

36:20.913 --> 36:24.948
Someone who will protect
your family and your country,

36:24.950 --> 36:27.417
no matter the cost
to themselves.

36:27.419 --> 36:29.553
No.

36:29.555 --> 36:32.222
How could you even consider her?

36:32.224 --> 36:35.492
She just blackmailed Elizabeth,
and offered up her life

36:35.494 --> 36:38.628
to be sure the Bourbons never
threaten her children again.

36:38.630 --> 36:41.331
If England had called her
bluff, she would have died.

36:41.333 --> 36:45.402
She's been a danger to you
one too many times.

36:46.738 --> 36:49.806
She saw me
as a threat to her sons.

36:49.808 --> 36:51.641
But when I lose you

36:51.643 --> 36:55.412
and leave France,
I won't be anymore.

36:55.414 --> 36:58.648
(sighs) She will
protect your family.

36:58.650 --> 37:01.418
She'll keep them safe.

37:04.690 --> 37:06.489
(dog barking in distance)

37:06.491 --> 37:08.558
(fire crackling softly)

37:08.560 --> 37:09.793
It's all right.

37:09.795 --> 37:11.361
You're safe now.

37:12.231 --> 37:13.797
Who did this to you?

37:13.799 --> 37:15.699
Was it the witch?
Was it Delphine?

37:15.701 --> 37:16.833
WOMAN:
I-I...

37:16.835 --> 37:18.501
don't know who it was.

37:18.503 --> 37:20.904
I couldn't see his
face in the dark.

37:20.906 --> 37:23.707
<i> His</i> face?
He tried to cut me open.

37:23.709 --> 37:25.508
He tried to take my heart.

37:25.510 --> 37:28.311
DEPUTY: I'll call off
the search for Delphine.

37:28.313 --> 37:29.679
No. Keep looking for her.

37:29.681 --> 37:31.581
Knock on every door
in every village.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.717
I don't understand.
Delphine predicted
that evil

37:33.719 --> 37:35.552
would strike the castle,
then the village.

37:35.554 --> 37:38.388
The young people I found in the
boat both worked in the castle.

37:38.390 --> 37:39.856
This woman works here
in the village.

37:39.858 --> 37:41.725
If we find Delphine,
we might be able

37:41.727 --> 37:43.593
to stop the killer
before he strikes again.

37:44.997 --> 37:48.498
Thank you, Francis,
for granting my release.

37:49.701 --> 37:52.469
You have Mary
to thank for that.

37:52.471 --> 37:54.938
She called off
the engagement with Charles

37:54.940 --> 37:57.774
for the sake
of both our countries.

37:58.744 --> 38:01.878
She suggested
I reconsider you.

38:01.880 --> 38:05.515
She does have her moments,
doesn't she?

38:05.517 --> 38:06.816
(exhales)

38:07.919 --> 38:09.986
(whispers):
Promise me.

38:12.557 --> 38:14.624
I'll look after her.

38:14.626 --> 38:17.027
I will look
after everyone.

38:17.029 --> 38:19.362
I promise you.

38:22.501 --> 38:26.703
I know I've done
terrible things.

38:26.705 --> 38:29.906
I'm sorry I wasn't the mother
that you wanted me to be.

38:29.908 --> 38:32.442
I did my best.

38:33.445 --> 38:35.312
I know.

38:35.314 --> 38:37.447
In your own way.

38:38.917 --> 38:41.451
(footsteps approaching)

38:42.954 --> 38:45.722
I must rest now.

38:58.670 --> 39:01.871
I appreciate
all that you've done for me.

39:03.875 --> 39:05.775
Catherine...

39:07.446 --> 39:08.878
Don Carlos of Spain.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.513
It was your spies

39:10.515 --> 39:12.582
that got that information
to me, wasn't it,

39:12.584 --> 39:14.017
so I could make a new alliance?

39:15.687 --> 39:18.755
I knew you couldn't
leave France empty-handed.

39:24.062 --> 39:26.129
Is there anything
I can bring you?

39:26.131 --> 39:28.932
I've sent for oranges
from the trees in Nice.

39:28.934 --> 39:30.967
They'll be arriving
tomorrow morning.

39:30.969 --> 39:33.703
I don't care
about any of that anymore.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.940
I just want more time with you.

39:36.942 --> 39:40.744
¶ ¶

39:58.730 --> 40:01.765
Did my wife enjoy
her wedding day?

40:01.767 --> 40:04.067
Mm.

40:04.069 --> 40:08.438
CATHERINE:
Congratulations to you both.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.807
Catherine.
How was the ceremony?

40:10.809 --> 40:14.043
I wouldn't know, as you seem to
have forgotten<i> my</i> invitation.

40:14.045 --> 40:16.446
What are you
doing here?

40:16.448 --> 40:18.415
Well, this might seem
a bit awkward,

40:18.417 --> 40:21.084
but my son has asked me back
into his life.

40:21.086 --> 40:22.719
So here I am.

40:22.721 --> 40:24.721
Back in your lives, too.

40:26.525 --> 40:28.925
May they be long and healthy.
