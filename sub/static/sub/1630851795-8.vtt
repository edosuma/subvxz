01:15.142 --> 01:17.543
listen, jerry's in
the hospital right now, okay?

01:17.545 --> 01:19.945
Sorry we're late, well,
he's in the hospital,

01:19.947 --> 01:22.915
throwing up, sweating,
weak in his arms and legs,

01:22.917 --> 01:25.350
can't use his left arm
hardly or anything.

01:25.352 --> 01:27.453
And they're now
transporting him

01:27.455 --> 01:30.522
to asheville over
to the big hospital.

01:30.524 --> 01:32.324
He's got bleeding
on his brain,

01:32.326 --> 01:34.893
takes him a little while
to answer a question.

01:34.895 --> 01:38.931
Um, so something's definitely
going wrong with the...

01:38.933 --> 01:40.632
With the mind, with the brain.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.801
I don't know any...
All the details yet.

01:42.803 --> 01:46.271
But, uh, jerry's in
pretty rough shape right now.

01:46.273 --> 01:49.541
And, um, we're both
in rough shape.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.010
Yeah, I guess I can go on here

01:52.012 --> 01:54.146
and check on
the champagne myself

01:54.148 --> 01:55.514

<i>  I just hope that</i>
<i>  he gets better.</i>

But he's got bleeding
on the brain.

And his blood pressure
is at a stage

02:08.295 --> 02:10.796

<i>  But this point, jerry's</i>
<i>  with some very smart doctors,</i>

02:13.434 --> 02:16.335

<i>  My wedding's coming up.</i>

<i>  I've only got a few</i>
<i>  more days left, you know,</i>

02:18.372 --> 02:20.506
and the pressure is on,
but I can't help

02:20.508 --> 02:21.874
but be thinking about jerry.

02:21.876 --> 02:24.943
This is mine

02:24.945 --> 02:26.912
We're gonna get this ready
for the wedding.

02:30.151 --> 02:32.484
Well, speak of the devil,
that's old jerry.

02:33.587 --> 02:34.586
Hey, buddy.

Playing with these
champagne bottles

02:36.891 --> 02:38.090
like you asked me to.

02:38.092 --> 02:40.159
Biggest question is
how you doing?

02:40.161 --> 02:42.060
<i> [jerry] I'm hanging</i>
<i>  in there, getting...</i>

02:42.062 --> 02:43.829
<i>  They're just trying to</i>
<i>  figure out what's going on,</i>

02:43.831 --> 02:45.931
<i>  bleeding on the brain,</i>
<i>  and trying to figure out why.</i>

02:45.933 --> 02:47.766
Oh, my god, man, that...

02:47.768 --> 02:49.635
<i>  They have me hooked</i>
<i>  up to all these</i>
<i>  daggum machines</i>

02:49.637 --> 02:51.870
<i>  and ivs and pumps</i>

02:51.872 --> 02:54.773
<i>  and all kinds of gadgets</i>
<i>  and stuff.</i>

02:54.775 --> 02:56.108
But the main most
important thing

02:56.110 --> 02:57.176
is you take care of yourself

02:57.178 --> 02:58.977
and get better and everything.

02:58.979 --> 03:01.313
<i>  You know that the champagne</i>

03:01.315 --> 03:03.682
<i>  is important to you...</i>
<i>  To your woman there.</i>

03:03.684 --> 03:05.484
<i>  I wanna make sure</i>
<i>  we get that taken care of.</i>

03:05.486 --> 03:07.553
<i>  So continue on getting them</i>
<i>  bottles ready</i>

03:07.555 --> 03:09.054
so we can get that process
<i>  done.</i>

03:09.056 --> 03:10.322
I will, I'll do that, brother,

03:10.324 --> 03:12.424
but my biggest concern
is you get better.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.660
I need you.
You know, you're my brother.

03:14.662 --> 03:15.994
You're my other partner.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.095
You see what I'm saying?

03:17.097 --> 03:18.030
<i> [jerry] I hear you.</i>

03:18.032 --> 03:19.531
I need you not to worry
about all this.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.767
<i>  But you know me,</i>
<i>  I wanna make stuff sure...</i>

03:21.769 --> 03:23.101
<i>  Make sure stuff gets done.</i>

03:23.103 --> 03:24.236
[laughs] I know you do.

03:24.238 --> 03:25.671
<i>  The state I'm in.</i>

03:25.673 --> 03:28.440
You take care of yourself
and keep me updated, okay?

03:28.442 --> 03:29.474
<i> [jerry] all right,</i>
<i>  see you soon.</i>

03:29.476 --> 03:31.076
All right.

03:31.078 --> 03:34.313
He seems to be in
real good spirits and talking,

03:34.315 --> 03:37.649
but you can tell he's weak
and he's real tired.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.952
But, uh, there
ain't no give up in him,

03:39.954 --> 03:41.220
that's for sure.

03:41.222 --> 03:42.988
It kind of lifts my spirits
up a little bit,

03:42.990 --> 03:44.723
and we're gonna
make this happen...

03:44.725 --> 03:47.693
We're gonna get this champagne
ready for the wedding.

03:47.695 --> 03:49.528
Well, I guess
I just got to get them

03:49.530 --> 03:51.230
upside down and vertical.

03:51.232 --> 03:52.965
Me and jerry, we started
the second fermentation

03:52.967 --> 03:54.433
on the champagne a while back,

03:54.435 --> 03:55.801
<i>  where we add our bubbles</i>

03:55.803 --> 03:57.903
<i>  by adding the champagne,</i>
<i>  yeast, and sugar.</i>

03:57.905 --> 04:00.239
Time to start rotating
the bottles up vertically

04:00.241 --> 04:02.307
<i>  so that leftover</i>
<i>  champagne yeast</i>

04:02.309 --> 04:04.042
<i>  will come to</i>
<i>  the neck of the bottle,</i>

04:04.044 --> 04:05.911
then when we freeze
all that sediment

04:05.913 --> 04:07.879
right here in this neck,
we take it,

04:07.881 --> 04:10.616
knock this cap off,
blow the plug,

04:10.618 --> 04:12.351
and then cork it off.

04:12.353 --> 04:13.852
<i>  You definitely</i>
<i>  don't want nothing</i>

04:13.854 --> 04:15.420
floating around
in your champagne.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.623
That kinda turns people off.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.291
Yeah, you know,
people want their champagne

04:19.293 --> 04:20.959
to be just as clear
as it can be.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.894
It can have color to it.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.563
But it don't
need to be cloudy.

04:24.565 --> 04:27.633
<i>  So I've got to just get this</i>
<i>  blueberry champagne finished</i>

04:27.635 --> 04:29.067
and that's what
I intend to do.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.535
All right. We're good to go.

04:35.175 --> 04:38.176
[upbeat music playing]

04:44.952 --> 04:46.018
oh.

04:46.020 --> 04:48.320
The higher we get,
the slower we go.

04:48.322 --> 04:49.554

<i> [digger] you know, last year,</i>

05:02.202 --> 05:06.038
<i>  we put some liquor on</i>
<i>  a french shrimp boat agent.</i>

05:06.040 --> 05:08.173
Everything worked out perfect.

05:08.175 --> 05:10.175
-[mark] hot damn.
-There's something
in there for us.

05:12.546 --> 05:15.213
We put liquor in these
about seven, eight months ago.

05:15.215 --> 05:16.481
Yeah.

05:16.483 --> 05:17.983
But we need to
finish them off.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.484
We need to get them aged up

05:19.486 --> 05:21.119
like we did
the ones on the boat,

05:21.121 --> 05:22.788
so we can sell them
and make some money.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.122
Mmm-hmm.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.424
<i>  Honestly, a shrimp boat</i>

05:25.426 --> 05:27.959
is just too much risk,
too time-consuming.

05:27.961 --> 05:30.295
<i>  It's a seven hour-drive</i>
<i>  in each direction</i>

05:30.297 --> 05:33.298
<i>  with two barrels</i>
<i>  of a untaxed whiskey.</i>

05:33.300 --> 05:36.768
Also, he's subject
to coast guard inspections.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.270
[digger] you know, mark,
here in these mountains,

05:38.272 --> 05:41.206
temperatures change pretty
drastic day to night,

05:41.208 --> 05:44.176
along with humidity.
Barometric pressure changes.

05:44.178 --> 05:45.911
We've just got to figure out

05:45.913 --> 05:48.146
something that causes motion.

05:48.148 --> 05:50.949
All the factors in aging
liquors are important.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.551
<i>  The barometric pressure,</i>

05:52.553 --> 05:54.686
<i>  the temperature change,</i>
<i>  humidity,</i>

05:54.688 --> 05:58.023
but none of them are
as important for rapid aging

05:58.025 --> 06:00.726
as the motion of the liquor
in the barrel.

06:00.728 --> 06:02.227
It don't matter
what moves them,

06:02.229 --> 06:03.795
as long as they move.

06:03.797 --> 06:06.064
It's got to be something
that occurs naturally,

06:06.066 --> 06:07.432
land or water.

06:07.434 --> 06:09.267
It has to be wind or water.

06:09.269 --> 06:10.435
Wind or water.

06:10.437 --> 06:12.371
Our dilemma is,
we know we need to

06:12.373 --> 06:14.873
<i>  make a ocean aged liquor,</i>
<i>  if you will,</i>

06:14.875 --> 06:15.841
in the mountains.

06:15.843 --> 06:17.242
We ain't got no ocean,

06:17.244 --> 06:18.910
but we got a lot of different
kinds of water,

06:18.912 --> 06:21.546
we got moving water,
we got creeks, we got rivers.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.648
Every piece of water
in our neck of the woods,

06:23.650 --> 06:26.685
somebody fishing it,
kayaking it.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.553
-Too many fishermen on it.
-[digger] yeah.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.389
Wind is gonna be
our better option.

06:30.391 --> 06:32.958
I say we go with wind
right off the bat,

06:32.960 --> 06:34.359
and see what we can do
with it.

06:34.361 --> 06:35.594
[mark] okay.

06:35.596 --> 06:37.295
You know, digger's idea
for sea aging

06:37.297 --> 06:38.964
in the mountains is wind.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.532
It just has to move this much.

06:40.534 --> 06:41.967
[digger] that's all it needs.

06:41.969 --> 06:44.369
<i>  Now the biggest problem</i>
<i>  we've got to overcome</i>

06:44.371 --> 06:47.906
is how do we replicate
that constant motion?

06:47.908 --> 06:50.509
I mean if it moved...
If it do that right there...

06:50.511 --> 06:52.210
-Ten hours a day.
-Yeah.

06:52.212 --> 06:54.646
So here we go,
we got to find some place

06:54.648 --> 06:56.415
to put our liquor in the wind.

06:56.417 --> 06:57.883
-Cool.
-Thank you, puss.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.284

is I got these two stills.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.251
I don't know
if it's worthy or not,

08:39.253 --> 08:40.852
but I do got a place or two

08:40.854 --> 08:42.954
that I wanna go inspect
and look around.

08:45.359 --> 08:47.292
If you want to go, I'm in.

08:47.294 --> 08:48.994
Sure it is good to see brian

08:48.996 --> 08:51.796
after all we've been through,
getting back home.

08:51.798 --> 08:53.732
It feels like we're back up
in action now.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.968
<i>  We're gonna go find</i>
<i>  a new still site,</i>

08:56.970 --> 08:59.571
move our stills in,
and get them to running.

08:59.573 --> 09:02.173
Just because we got raided
at a still site

09:02.175 --> 09:04.743
don't mean that we're
not gonna be moonshiners.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.112
<i>  He claims</i>
<i>  that he knows the place,</i>

09:07.114 --> 09:08.413
so what we're gonna do first

09:08.415 --> 09:09.714
is we're gonna take
the four-wheelers out

09:09.716 --> 09:11.416
<i>  and make sure</i>
<i>  there's a creek nearby.</i>

09:11.418 --> 09:12.784
<i>  Make sure</i>
<i>  the land looks good,</i>

09:12.786 --> 09:14.719
<i>  and make sure it's off</i>
<i>  the beaten path.</i>

09:14.721 --> 09:17.789
See if we can set
these stills up
and make some money.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.424
<i> [josh] how's that, amigo?</i>

09:19.426 --> 09:20.559
Them bugs are bad.

09:20.561 --> 09:22.494
-[brian] yeah...
-[laughs] damn.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.965
[engine revving]

09:26.967 --> 09:29.200
I'll tell you what,
nobody's driving a car

09:29.202 --> 09:30.635
to where we're getting to.

09:33.574 --> 09:34.406
Hold on, man.

09:34.875 --> 09:35.707
Hold on, man.

09:36.977 --> 09:37.876
Back up.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.544
[engine revving]

09:45.285 --> 09:46.751
[josh]
<i>  now I'm back with brian,</i>

09:46.753 --> 09:48.186
<i>  we got our side by sides,</i>

09:48.188 --> 09:49.554
and we're gonna try
to find us a still site.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.893
<i>  And then hopefully</i>
<i>  get these stills set up,</i>

09:54.895 --> 09:56.261
<i>  start making some run,</i>

09:56.263 --> 09:58.096
start contributing
to this business.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.268
[brian] oh, damn.

10:09.476 --> 10:12.077
[country music playing]

10:13.180 --> 10:14.813
[mark]
<i>  it's all about the notion of</i>

10:14.815 --> 10:16.881
<i>  letting tennessee</i>
<i>  whiskey sail.</i>

10:17.517 --> 10:19.517
<i>  Not sell, but sail.</i>

10:19.519 --> 10:21.786
<i>  Well, we'll see.</i>

10:21.788 --> 10:23.221
<i>  We've challenged</i>
<i>  ourselves now</i>

10:23.223 --> 10:26.391
to figure out a way to sea age
liquor on dry land.

10:26.393 --> 10:29.027
[digger] we'll give
<i> it a try anyhow.</i>

10:29.029 --> 10:30.996
<i> [mark] we ain't</i>
<i>  about trying, are we?</i>

10:30.998 --> 10:32.831
So we're gonna go
to an old barn

10:32.833 --> 10:36.001
<i>  and see if we can't replicate</i>
<i>  that constant motion.</i>

10:36.003 --> 10:38.603
Sometimes it's like being
in a wind tunnel in this barn,

10:38.605 --> 10:39.904
it gets big.

10:39.906 --> 10:41.406
Show me what you got
in mind here, puss.

10:41.408 --> 10:42.941
Well, my first thought is

10:42.943 --> 10:44.743
clip that rascal
around there.

10:44.745 --> 10:47.445
The best thing
about this old barn is

10:47.447 --> 10:48.546
<i>  it has accessibility.</i>

10:48.548 --> 10:49.981
<i>  We can drive right to it.</i>

10:49.983 --> 10:51.750
<i>  And we have</i>
<i>  the owner's blessing,</i>

10:51.752 --> 10:54.719
you know, those are
crucial, crucial things

10:54.721 --> 10:56.388
in the whiskey business.

10:56.390 --> 10:58.223
And then mr. Chain.

10:58.225 --> 10:59.524
[mark] this is overkill,

10:59.526 --> 11:01.693
but we're simulating
it being full.

11:01.695 --> 11:03.895
<i>  I honestly feel</i>
<i>  that aged whiskey</i>

11:03.897 --> 11:06.498
will command a hundred dollars
more per gallon.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.433
<i>  That's not a lot of money</i>

11:08.435 --> 11:10.068
if you have to wait five years

11:10.070 --> 11:11.603
in order to get it.

11:11.605 --> 11:14.873
<i>  But if you can make</i>
<i>  a hundred additional dollars</i>

11:14.875 --> 11:16.975
in six months' time
per gallon,

11:16.977 --> 11:18.343
<i>  it's a good deal for us.</i>

11:18.345 --> 11:19.477
It'll hold it.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.780
It'll hold 3,000 pounds.

11:21.782 --> 11:24.249
Our plan is
we'll use a chain pile

11:24.251 --> 11:25.784
to pull the barrels up,

11:25.786 --> 11:29.888
and then we'll suspend them
on ratchet straps

11:29.890 --> 11:32.457
between the poles
and the pole bar.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.192
You keep your toes
out from under there,

11:34.194 --> 11:35.994
-puss, in case...
-[digger] why?

11:35.996 --> 11:37.962
Don't you worry about that.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.366
Oh, you watch
your toes, too...

11:41.368 --> 11:43.435
[laughs]

11:43.437 --> 11:45.203
that was stupid as hell.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.672
If we can get the barrel
swinging in this barn,

11:47.674 --> 11:48.606
it's perfect.

11:48.608 --> 11:49.808
All right.

11:49.810 --> 11:52.043
Yeah, tighten that
bad boy up.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.979
It's secure
and it's easily accessible.

11:54.981 --> 11:56.915
<i>  We can back</i>
<i>  the truck right in</i>

11:56.917 --> 11:58.316
to where we wanna hang
the barrels.

11:58.318 --> 12:00.085
I may drive back out
from under it.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.486
[digger]
well, whatever, chief.

12:02.456 --> 12:03.688
Whoa now.

12:03.690 --> 12:06.524
[laughs] there you go.

12:06.526 --> 12:08.159
You forgot I was back here,
did you?

12:08.161 --> 12:09.294
I forgot you was hanging on.

12:09.296 --> 12:10.628
I thought you got down.

12:11.098 --> 12:12.664
I just about did.

12:12.666 --> 12:15.033
<i>  We got a barrel swinging</i>
<i>  from the rafters here now,</i>

12:15.035 --> 12:17.135
<i>  we got to wait on the wind</i>
<i>  to get here and move it.</i>

12:17.137 --> 12:19.037
You know, right now everything
is hanging in the balance.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.472
No pun intended.

12:20.474 --> 12:23.742
[mark] see, it's moving
a little tiny bit.

12:23.744 --> 12:28.279
I just don't know if that's
enough to jostle it enough.

12:28.281 --> 12:30.882
We look at it,
we take a step back from it,

12:30.884 --> 12:34.085
<i>  and it's just</i>
<i>  hanging out there, you know,</i>

12:34.087 --> 12:35.353
like a hair in a biscuit,

12:35.355 --> 12:37.355
it ain't really
doing anything.

12:37.357 --> 12:38.757
But we needed to move you know

12:38.759 --> 12:43.094
about just at least that much
right there.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.029
<i>  I mean just to push</i>
<i>  with your finger on it,</i>

12:45.031 --> 12:47.198
it sends it moving,
it sends it rocking,

12:47.200 --> 12:48.867
doing what it needs to do.

12:48.869 --> 12:51.269
<i>  But, uh, the wind</i>
<i>  has to do it,</i>

12:51.271 --> 12:53.304
digger and myself,
we're not gonna be here

12:53.306 --> 12:55.273
to push it backwards
and forwards.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.076
Is there any way even
to check weather pattern?

12:58.078 --> 12:59.477
Let me look at the wind,

12:59.479 --> 13:01.613
I'll look at
the aviation website.

13:01.615 --> 13:02.747
How high are we here?

13:02.749 --> 13:05.350
We're 1,327 feet.

13:05.352 --> 13:07.185
Winds at this elevation
are calm,

13:07.187 --> 13:09.020
that's like this
little boring

13:09.022 --> 13:10.555
five mile air breeze.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.757
We need a windier place.

13:12.759 --> 13:14.759
-Yeah.
-I don't know where to go.

13:14.761 --> 13:17.762
But I know for a fact
the higher up we are,

13:17.764 --> 13:19.197
the more wind that blows.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.800
Mountain tops are where
you get your biggest wind.

13:21.802 --> 13:23.268
We all know that.

13:23.270 --> 13:26.104
Got that old topographical map
to give us elevations,

13:26.106 --> 13:27.906
all these knobs through here.

13:27.908 --> 13:31.409
I'm thinking we need to go
find my old topographical map,

13:31.411 --> 13:32.811
<i>  look at the highest peaks,</i>

13:32.813 --> 13:35.213
and then try to find a way
to get up there

13:35.215 --> 13:37.048
and put some liquor
somewhere to age it.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.349
We know this will work.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.418
It will.
We just got to find the wind.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.859
[dramatic music playing]

13:56.503 --> 13:58.536
help me pick up this stuff
right here.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.505
<i>  Me and brian are riding</i>
<i>  all over the place,</i>

14:00.507 --> 14:01.973
trying to locate a still site.

14:01.975 --> 14:05.109
Long story short,
I turn them side by side over.

14:05.111 --> 14:06.911
See, what happened was...

14:09.249 --> 14:10.915
Joshua was coming in hot.

14:12.118 --> 14:13.484
<i> [josh] I still don't know</i>
<i>  what happened really.</i>

14:13.486 --> 14:15.286
I just know
that it flipped over

14:15.288 --> 14:18.456
and I knew as it was going
I just locked on tight

14:18.458 --> 14:20.191
and I held on
as hard as could.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.227
<i>  I knew it was too late</i>
<i>  to catch myself.</i>

14:22.229 --> 14:24.062
<i>  There was no freaking</i>
<i>  stopping it.</i>

14:24.064 --> 14:26.030
<i>  When it toppled over</i>
<i>  at some point,</i>

14:26.032 --> 14:27.599
<i>  it landed on my foot...</i>

14:27.601 --> 14:30.602
-[groans]
<i>  -my foot hurting bad.</i>

14:30.604 --> 14:33.304
When I got up,
I was thinking that my foot

14:33.306 --> 14:34.873
was cut in half
inside my boot.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.074
That's what it felt like.

14:38.411 --> 14:41.179
This [bleep] went on your leg,
your foot was stuck

14:41.181 --> 14:43.248
in the steering wheel
and it was like flipped over.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.717
So here josh sits
with a purple foot.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.418
<i>  Like this thing</i>
<i>  was instantly purple</i>

14:47.420 --> 14:49.020
<i>  and he could barely</i>
<i>  get his boot off.</i>

14:49.022 --> 14:50.722
All right, man,
you gotta go to the hospital.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.724
[josh] I just wanna go home.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.192
<i>  My grandma and grandpa said,</i>

14:54.194 --> 14:56.828
"boy, if you're gonna be dumb,
you got to be tough."

14:56.830 --> 14:59.664
<i>  I was trying to get up</i>
<i>  and walk it off,</i>

14:59.666 --> 15:01.399
but I wasn't walking
any damn where.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.835
My whole foot
is turning purple.

15:03.837 --> 15:05.803
I gotta go to the hospital,
I'm just telling you.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.573
I know I do,
my foot's crushed.

15:09.876 --> 15:11.609
Look how purple it is...

15:13.580 --> 15:14.646
-[bleep] just take...
-Yeah.

15:14.648 --> 15:15.546
Just take me.

15:24.991 --> 15:26.791
<i>  I was trying to be</i>
<i>  tough about it.</i>

15:28.628 --> 15:31.562
Just another
little old checkmark,

15:31.564 --> 15:32.997
another brick in the wall,

15:32.999 --> 15:37.001
broken bones, and injuries
to the josh owens saga.

[engine revving]

15:58.391 --> 16:01.392
[acoustic music playing]

16:06.366 --> 16:09.200
[sighs] well,
my initial plan is today

16:09.202 --> 16:11.336
is to fill these bins
with ice.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.271
I've got to freeze
all the necks

16:13.273 --> 16:15.573
<i>  of these champagne bottles,</i>
<i>  just the necks,</i>

16:15.575 --> 16:17.709
<i>  so I can pull it out</i>
<i>  and knock the cap off,</i>

16:17.711 --> 16:19.243
blow the frozen plug out,

16:19.245 --> 16:22.914
which contains all the
sediment of the leftover yeast

16:22.916 --> 16:26.150
and particles that could have
been left over into the wine.

16:26.152 --> 16:29.220
And then cork it off,
put my wire cage on it,

16:29.222 --> 16:30.855
<i>  and she's ready</i>
<i>  to rock and roll.</i>

16:30.857 --> 16:32.991
But first off,
I wanna give old jerry a call.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.492
You know,
me and jerry are partners.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.661
<i>  We do this stuff together.</i>
<i>  We need each other.</i>

16:36.663 --> 16:39.030
So I'm glad that
he's able to communicate

16:39.032 --> 16:40.231
with me through phone.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.333
What's up, buddy?

16:42.335 --> 16:43.668
<i>  Oh, I'm just laying here.</i>

16:43.670 --> 16:45.737
I got these bottles
I wanted to show you.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.638
<i>  Nice.</i>

16:47.640 --> 16:49.807
I got all the...
All the bottles upside down.

16:49.809 --> 16:51.676
I guess now, next thing is

16:51.678 --> 16:53.378
I'll just start freezing
those necks.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.013
<i>  Don't forget to get</i>
<i>  two bags of ice</i>

16:55.115 --> 16:56.514
<i>  and add a</i>
<i>  little bit of salt.</i>

16:56.516 --> 16:58.383
<i>  I want about two inches</i>
<i>  up the bottleneck.</i>

16:58.385 --> 16:59.584
So about two inches?

16:59.586 --> 17:01.486
<i> -Two just over the neck, yeah.</i>
<i> -Okay.</i>

17:01.488 --> 17:03.221
<i> [jerry] now make sure</i>
<i>  you do it right.</i>

17:03.223 --> 17:05.023
-I'm gonna do it right.
<i> -[jerry] yeah.</i>

17:05.025 --> 17:06.057
<i>  Make me proud.</i>

17:06.059 --> 17:07.392
All right, brother, I'll do.

17:07.394 --> 17:08.659
-See you, man.
<i>  -Have a good night.</i>

17:08.661 --> 17:10.094
All right. Bye-bye.

17:10.096 --> 17:12.397
<i>  Jerry is so hell-bent</i>
<i>  on me finishing it.</i>

17:12.399 --> 17:13.664
I want it to be as perfect

17:13.666 --> 17:15.833
as I could ever
possibly make it now.

17:23.376 --> 17:24.642
All right.

17:27.914 --> 17:30.014
<i>  I'm at the last process</i>
<i>  of this champagne.</i>

17:30.016 --> 17:31.549
<i>  I've got to freeze</i>
<i>  all the necks</i>

17:31.551 --> 17:33.217
<i>  of these champagne bottles.</i>

17:33.219 --> 17:36.320
Today is the final process
of the champagne run.

17:36.322 --> 17:39.090
<i>  When we freeze that neck,</i>
<i>  we can lock that top off,</i>

17:39.092 --> 17:40.658
<i>  shoot that plug of ice out,</i>

17:40.660 --> 17:42.326
<i>  which is gonna contain</i>
<i>  all the sediment in it</i>

17:42.328 --> 17:43.928
and then turn around
and re-cork it

17:43.930 --> 17:45.163
and it should be good to go.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.198
I can do it by myself.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.567
But, you know,
it's always best

17:49.569 --> 17:51.702
if you have you partner
here with you.

17:51.704 --> 17:54.672
He wants me to carry forward,
I'm carrying forward

17:54.674 --> 17:56.407
a little salt to it.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.809
<i>  The salt, it starts</i>

17:57.811 --> 17:59.811
the process
of melting the ice,

17:59.813 --> 18:01.479
but it'll be colder

18:01.481 --> 18:03.514
than the freezing
temperature of 32.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.316
<i>  As soon as you put the neck</i>
<i>  to your champagne bottles</i>

18:05.318 --> 18:09.253
<i>  in the icy, salty water,</i>
<i>  it's gonna immediately</i>

18:09.255 --> 18:11.055
start to freeze the neck
of that bottle.

18:11.057 --> 18:13.391
I'm gonna get my boards,
got to lift this up

18:13.393 --> 18:16.561
so I can get
my ice bin under here.

18:16.563 --> 18:18.429
But I'll tell you what, I wish
jerry was here right now

18:18.431 --> 18:19.997
to help me do this.

18:19.999 --> 18:21.232
Yeah, I got to be careful

18:21.234 --> 18:22.967
not to shake
these things up too much.

18:22.969 --> 18:24.535
I gotta bring the bottles up,

18:24.537 --> 18:27.071
so I can slide
the dadgum ice bin under them.

18:27.073 --> 18:29.740
Now, I need to take a board
out at a time I guess.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.344
<i>  And then I got to bring them</i>
<i>  right back down,</i>

18:33.346 --> 18:35.213
but you only want your neck
sticking down an ice

18:35.215 --> 18:36.914
because that's all
you wanna freeze

18:36.916 --> 18:39.117
because that's where
all your sediments' at,
is in that neck.

18:39.119 --> 18:41.385
All I got to do is wait
for these things to freeze.

18:41.387 --> 18:43.421
Jerry, I know
he'd love to be there,

18:43.423 --> 18:45.456
<i>  but he can't be and he's</i>
<i>  depending on me to do it.</i>

18:45.458 --> 18:47.758
So, you got figure
it out for yourself,

18:47.760 --> 18:49.327
you know, sometimes.

18:49.329 --> 18:52.563
Well, oh, sure.

18:58.071 --> 18:59.537
Oh, yes.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.739
We got a good plug
of ice in there.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.774
We've got all
the sediment from the yeast

19:03.776 --> 19:06.043
and particles
and everything left behind

19:06.045 --> 19:08.446
that we do not want
in our champagne

19:08.448 --> 19:12.116
froze right here in the neck
of this champagne bottle.

19:12.118 --> 19:13.551
All right.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.520
We got to take the cap off,
blow it out.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.855
It should blow
the cube of ice out.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.557
I hope like so.

19:23.696 --> 19:24.695
Uh-oh. Here we go.

19:26.232 --> 19:28.065
Let me shake that up,
blow that down there.

19:29.335 --> 19:31.002
It froze too much.

19:35.074 --> 19:36.908
All we got to do
is get that to blow out.

19:40.180 --> 19:42.580
Oh, there we go... [laughs]

19:42.582 --> 19:44.148
boy, what a good blow.

19:44.751 --> 19:45.716
Here we go.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.018
We got champagne.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.986
Jerry's gonna be proud now.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.655
<i>  So you got to be real,</i>
<i>  real quick.</i>

19:50.657 --> 19:52.723
Get back to the table,
cork it off,

19:52.725 --> 19:53.958
put the wire cage on it.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.359
There we go.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.128
We can lay it flat again.

19:57.130 --> 19:58.596
<i>  If you don't put</i>
<i>  the wire cage on it,</i>

19:58.598 --> 19:59.964
it could blow the cork.

20:02.602 --> 20:04.435
Right there.
There's the plug of ice

20:04.437 --> 20:05.937
that comes out
of the champagne bottle.

20:05.939 --> 20:08.139
That's your yeast sediment
right there.

20:09.008 --> 20:10.942
And we got
good clean champagne.

20:10.944 --> 20:12.410
Yee-haw.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.812
I'm actually having fun
popping these caps

20:14.814 --> 20:16.681
and plugging it off,
and putting the wire cages on.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.116
<i>  You know, I'm about to</i>
<i>  taste this champagne</i>

20:19.118 --> 20:20.785
<i>  for the very,</i>
<i>  very first time.</i>

20:20.787 --> 20:22.954
<i>  There's a whole hell of a lot</i>
<i>  riding on this right now.</i>

20:23.389 --> 20:24.655
Damn it.

20:24.657 --> 20:25.756
Calm down.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.967
Oh, my god.

20:35.969 --> 20:38.336
Jerry is gonna be
proud of this.

20:38.338 --> 20:41.105
<i>  I tell you what, man,</i>
<i>  this stuff is phenomenal.</i>

20:41.107 --> 20:43.574
He's got the blueberry
coming through all the way.

20:45.111 --> 20:46.644
Whoo, boy.

20:46.646 --> 20:48.980
<i>  But right up there</i>
<i>  about the 12%, 13%</i>

20:48.982 --> 20:50.581
<i>  alcohol in there.</i>

20:50.583 --> 20:51.882
I'm tickled to death.
I can't believe

20:51.884 --> 20:54.252
that it's turned out this way.
Whoo.

20:54.254 --> 20:56.153
<i>  You know, jerry would love</i>
<i>  to be here right now</i>

20:56.155 --> 20:58.522
to help me do this,
but he's not.

20:58.524 --> 21:01.359
I just try to make it
as fun as I can for myself.

21:01.361 --> 21:04.395
<i>  He'll be proud of my work</i>
<i>  that I've done and completed</i>

21:04.397 --> 21:07.732
for both of us
and it's a win-win at the end.

21:07.734 --> 21:09.767
Oh, yes, we're getting there.

21:13.206 --> 21:16.207
[country music playing]

21:23.483 --> 21:24.715
it's getting here

21:24.717 --> 21:26.384

aren't poor anymore.

21:26.386 --> 21:27.785
<i>  You know, mark and myself,</i>

21:27.787 --> 21:29.153
<i>  we got to figure out</i>
<i>  some place</i>

21:29.155 --> 21:32.590
where the wind moves enough
to keep these barrels moving.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.091
This topo map's gonna show us

21:34.093 --> 21:36.727
where we're high up
in the hills.

21:36.729 --> 21:38.596
I've got an old
topographical map

21:38.598 --> 21:40.965
<i>  and it shows us</i>
<i>  what the elevation is.</i>

21:40.967 --> 21:42.700
One thing that
we're not short on

21:42.702 --> 21:44.068
that's, mountaintops
around here.

21:44.070 --> 21:46.504
And all the...
All the highest peaks though,

21:46.506 --> 21:48.306

21:48.308 --> 21:50.207
Yeah, we can't be in no park.

21:50.209 --> 21:52.943
You do not do anything
illegal on federal land.

21:52.945 --> 21:56.747
That gets you more time than
doing the actual crime itself.

21:56.749 --> 21:58.115
Well, we got to have
some place

21:58.117 --> 22:00.151
people don't infringe
upon that.

22:00.153 --> 22:01.385
It's got to be secure.

<i> [mark] digger and I grew up</i>
<i>  in these mountains here</i>

<i>  and these hills</i>

Okay.

points of national park.

Yup, we have our cherokee.
Yup. Sure is.

22:43.429 --> 22:46.263

but we don't have access
to them.

It's an old theme park.

And that might work for us,
puss.

23:21.401 --> 23:22.466
Yup.

23:22.468 --> 23:24.001
It was a shoot 'em up town.

Yeah, I broke it
in like four places.

24:22.929 --> 24:25.229
It's gonna have
to have some pins in it.

24:25.231 --> 24:28.432

I can't really do anything.

24:31.304 --> 24:32.837

You know, I'm in pain,

What I'm not good
about is the fact

that I can't go do anything.

where I maybe

could make some money
without the stills.

What's the trick
you got up your sleeve?

26:39.899 --> 26:42.566
-Just go get the whiskey.
-All right.

26:42.568 --> 26:44.568
Brian, he's picking up
my cut of the liquor

26:44.570 --> 26:47.605
instead of picking up the cash
because I got this idea,

26:47.607 --> 26:49.340
it's risky
and it may not work.

26:49.342 --> 26:50.908
But if it does work,

26:50.910 --> 26:52.443
I think
I'm really onto something.

<i>  I got half</i>

27:21.907 --> 27:23.340
<i>  of the champagne</i>
<i>  going to the wedding</i>

27:23.342 --> 27:24.675

that I'm going to try

27:24.677 --> 27:27.077
to sell to somebody
to try to help jerry out.

27:27.079 --> 27:30.080
We've got it done, man.
We got to call jerry.

-We got good champagne.
<i> -[jerry] nice.</i>

27:55.174 --> 27:57.207
<i>  Ready for the wedding, huh?</i>

27:57.209 --> 28:00.310
It's all ready, man.
That's for sure.

28:06.585 --> 28:09.787
Yeah. That's okay, brother.
As long as you get well.

28:09.789 --> 28:11.121
It's all right

No, man, we don't never know
nothing about it, you know?

28:19.932 --> 28:21.432
<i>  Nah, I sure don't.</i>

28:23.202 --> 28:24.835

<i>  What can I do?</i>

28:30.743 --> 28:33.043
You know,
you can always rewind

28:33.045 --> 28:35.145
and always tell yourself,

28:35.147 --> 28:37.514
"I should have done this
or why didn't I do that?"

28:37.516 --> 28:40.317
you know, every one
of us is guilty of it.

28:40.319 --> 28:42.519
Well, I've got this done,
brother.

28:42.521 --> 28:44.321
<i> [jerry] I'm proud of you, man.</i>

28:44.323 --> 28:45.622
<i>  I knew you could do it.</i>

28:46.792 --> 28:48.659
Take care of yourself.

Damn. [chuckles]

29:33.639 --> 29:36.206
I hate getting emotional, man.
I can't stand it.

29:39.678 --> 29:41.044
I just figured
he'd been good enough

29:41.046 --> 29:43.013
to be at the wedding,
you know.

29:43.015 --> 29:46.016
I guess it's a bunch
of dudes for you.

29:46.018 --> 29:48.385
We think
we're better than we are,

29:48.387 --> 29:52.356
and then life hits.

29:53.526 --> 29:55.025
Brings you down.

29:57.229 --> 29:59.797
I just hope he gets better.
That's all I can hope for,

29:59.799 --> 30:01.532
that he gets better
and I'll do everything

30:01.534 --> 30:03.233
I can to help him.

30:03.235 --> 30:05.269
Even if he can't be
at the wedding,

30:05.271 --> 30:08.205
even if he can't continue
on working with me.

30:09.809 --> 30:12.910
I might one day
get somebody else to help me.

30:12.912 --> 30:17.214
But they won't never,
nobody ever replace jerry.

Oh, where the hell is brian?

He said
he'd be here.

30:40.840 --> 30:42.806
Henry, kenny, and tickle

30:42.808 --> 30:44.241
to pull my fair share
of the weight

30:44.243 --> 30:46.610
while I'm back here.
Now that I broke my foot,

30:46.612 --> 30:49.012
I don't wanna let henry,
kenny, or tickle down.

<i>  So I sent brian to virginia</i>

have to be real creative.

30:57.323 --> 30:59.256
Just come look at it.

30:59.258 --> 31:02.492
-110 gallons.
-Hell, yeah.

31:02.494 --> 31:04.394
There ain't no way
I'm gonna be running in

31:04.396 --> 31:06.463
and have a 600 gal steel site
over and over.

31:06.465 --> 31:08.632
<i>  So I've been thinking</i>
<i>  about something else.</i>

31:08.634 --> 31:11.134
We could take a little bit
of moonshine

31:11.136 --> 31:13.837
and turn it into a whole lot
of damn money.

31:13.839 --> 31:14.972
What do you wanna do
with all this?

31:14.974 --> 31:17.007
You know, everybody's
into this hard silky thing.

31:17.009 --> 31:18.108
Yeah.

31:18.110 --> 31:20.177
I was thinking about maybe

31:20.179 --> 31:21.879
trying to do something
like that.

31:21.881 --> 31:22.980
There's all these drinks

31:22.982 --> 31:24.715
popping up with carbonation
and stuff,

31:24.717 --> 31:27.050
you know,
and the, sort of, like soda

31:27.052 --> 31:28.418
and some of them
are really good.

31:28.420 --> 31:30.287
We could make flavored
seltzer water

31:30.289 --> 31:32.256
and add a little bit
of alcohol to it,

31:32.258 --> 31:35.325
like of a homemade
moonshine seltzer, you know.

31:35.327 --> 31:37.561
I know that sounds insane,

31:37.563 --> 31:39.763
but I think
it might be a worthy cause,

31:39.765 --> 31:41.698
because it's like
such a big thing right now,

31:41.700 --> 31:43.934
there's always companies
popping up doing it.

31:43.936 --> 31:46.503
You know, everybody's
got a hard seltzer. Yeah.

31:46.505 --> 31:48.238
I got to see...
Here are two things.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.807
Maybe we could take
a little bit of moonshine,

31:50.809 --> 31:53.010
mix it with some flavors
and stuff,

31:53.012 --> 31:55.379
pressurize it,
carbonate our own drink.

31:55.381 --> 31:56.980
<i>  We're really firing</i>
<i>  a hole this year.</i>

31:56.982 --> 31:59.283
<i>  We haven't hardly made</i>
<i>  a ounce of liquor.</i>

31:59.285 --> 32:01.118
I really need this idea
to work out.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.619
[brian] open up.

32:06.325 --> 32:09.326
Every time josh tells me
he's got some kind of an idea,

32:09.328 --> 32:11.261
sometimes it works
and sometimes it doesn't,

32:11.263 --> 32:12.562
but most of the time,

32:12.564 --> 32:15.132
he knows
what he's got going on.

32:15.134 --> 32:18.035
All right. So my whole plan
is just to try it out

32:18.037 --> 32:20.304
<i>  on a small scale</i>
<i>  just to see if it works,</i>

32:20.306 --> 32:22.039
so I don't waste
a lot of liquor.

a pressure cooker.

<i>  Hook it to a co2 tank.</i>

32:27.713 --> 32:29.947

-holy [bleep].

-do it again.

[brian] fire in the hole.

32:35.154 --> 32:36.920
We put the first batch
of moonshine in there

32:36.922 --> 32:38.989
and we put the pressure to it.

32:38.991 --> 32:41.124
[brian] I don't know if I'd
hold it right under your face.

32:41.126 --> 32:43.093

<i>  may be one of the biggest</i>

<i>  harebrained ideas</i>
<i>  I've ever had.</i>

32:45.597 --> 32:47.331
But for the hole it fills,

32:47.333 --> 32:49.232
man, we're definitely
gonna be onto something.

32:49.234 --> 32:51.435
Let see what it does
if it damn carbonates

32:51.437 --> 32:54.371
our moonshine or not.

32:54.373 --> 32:56.139
Does that look
carbonated to you?

32:56.141 --> 32:57.507
[brian] I don't know.

33:02.348 --> 33:03.814
Hell no.

33:08.921 --> 33:13.090

Son of a bitch.

33:19.631 --> 33:20.964
You need me to help you out?

33:20.966 --> 33:23.300
Don't throw the thing.
Set that on there.

33:25.771 --> 33:28.205
-Look here.
-I know. It used to be...

33:28.207 --> 33:29.706
Far down

33:29.708 --> 33:31.375
Well, I wouldn't put it
any different,

33:31.377 --> 33:33.043
I just have to stretch it out.

33:33.045 --> 33:34.177
I don't need it stretched out.

-Now what's up with that?
-[mark] I don't know.

[josh] that's not
carbonated worth a damn.

34:03.142 --> 34:05.409
That didn't
pan out for me too well.

34:05.411 --> 34:07.344
We're using some
pretty highproof moonshine

34:07.346 --> 34:09.012
<i>  and when I carbonate</i>
<i>  the liquor,</i>

34:09.014 --> 34:11.214
<i>  I see bubbles in it</i>
<i>  and I see it's carbonated,</i>

34:11.216 --> 34:13.083
<i>  but it goes flat</i>
<i>  almost instantly.</i>

34:16.021 --> 34:17.654
[grunts]
that's not carbonated.

34:17.656 --> 34:19.523
<i> [josh] I don't know.</i>
<i>  I'm not a scientist.</i>

34:19.525 --> 34:21.525
We got a lot
of experimenting to do.

34:21.527 --> 34:24.428
Adding that to moonshine
just don't make it carbonated.

34:24.430 --> 34:27.064
Alcohol contents
are high in it or something?

34:27.066 --> 34:29.032
Here's a jar of some
cherry moonshine in there,

34:29.034 --> 34:30.400
that we could put in there.

34:30.402 --> 34:31.935
Shoot, let's try it, hell,
it's worth a shot

34:31.937 --> 34:33.170
and it can't hurt it.

34:33.172 --> 34:34.738
<i>  I've been thinking, you know,</i>

34:34.740 --> 34:37.641
I've tried to carbonate
this high proof alcohol,

34:37.643 --> 34:40.577
well, water carbonates,
soda carbonates,

34:40.579 --> 34:43.580
and all these things
are forced carbonated.

34:43.582 --> 34:46.083
So maybe if I use
different ingredients,

34:46.085 --> 34:48.552
<i>  maybe, like, if I use</i>
<i>  a lower proof liquor,</i>

34:48.554 --> 34:52.222
an alcoholic beverage with
other ingredients mixed in it,

34:52.224 --> 34:53.924
maybe that'll hold
carbonation.

34:53.926 --> 34:55.292
Just gonna dump
the whole thing in there?

34:55.294 --> 34:56.793
Yeah, let it rip, tater chip.

some cherry bounce.

All right.

-Good theory.
-Oh, I'll just be damned.

35:16.115 --> 35:19.116
Wait, look here.
It fizzes just like a coke.

35:19.118 --> 35:21.284
Now that we got
another concoction in here,

35:21.286 --> 35:22.819

the fizz.

what do you think, josh?

35:25.324 --> 35:26.957
That's wild.

like a moonshine in a jar,

35:29.962 --> 35:33.230
to more like a soda
with a little alcohol in it.

35:33.232 --> 35:35.298
It just kind of took a little
bit of the edge off of it,

35:35.300 --> 35:36.900
and put a little bit
of fizz in it.

35:36.902 --> 35:38.969
-Is that not damn good?
-That's damn good.

35:38.971 --> 35:41.304
Yeah, that's damn good,
puts a spin on it, don't it?

35:41.306 --> 35:42.772
You know what josh owens
would say, don't you?

35:42.774 --> 35:45.041
-[josh] what?
-Damn.

35:45.043 --> 35:47.344
<i> [josh] I know a lot</i>
<i>  of alcohols like beer,</i>

35:47.346 --> 35:48.712
<i>  sparkling wine.</i>

35:48.714 --> 35:50.313
They create
their own carbon dioxide.

35:50.315 --> 35:51.982
<i>  But that's not</i>
<i>  what we're doing.</i>

35:51.984 --> 35:54.017
We're creating
an alcoholic drink

35:54.019 --> 35:55.385
and we're pressurizing it.

35:55.387 --> 35:57.220
We're putting the co2 in it.

35:57.222 --> 36:00.023
We're putting
our own carbon dioxide in it.

36:00.025 --> 36:02.025
-You see that?
-Cherry bounce seltzer?

36:02.027 --> 36:03.326
That's crazy.

36:03.328 --> 36:05.929
If we can take this
and turn this into something

36:05.931 --> 36:08.632
that actually holds up
and we got the corner

36:08.634 --> 36:10.333
of the market
far as I'm concerned.

36:10.335 --> 36:11.701
Two barrels of shine out there

36:11.703 --> 36:12.936
and in the... In the van.

36:12.938 --> 36:16.006
That will go a long way,

36:16.008 --> 36:18.508
you go to making some
flavors with that shine,

36:18.510 --> 36:20.744
because you're cutting it down
with that right there.

36:20.746 --> 36:23.246
It's gonna stretch it out
and double the money.

36:23.248 --> 36:25.749
That's over
a thousand courses, at least.

36:25.751 --> 36:27.784
This broken foot
may kick my ass

36:27.786 --> 36:29.553
but it sure ain't broke
my ass.

36:29.555 --> 36:31.721
I think we might be
onto something.

36:31.723 --> 36:33.056
I hope we are.

36:33.058 --> 36:34.791
Something other
than a broke foot.

36:34.793 --> 36:36.259
[josh] yeah, no doubt.

36:44.236 --> 36:46.203
[country music playing]

36:46.205 --> 36:48.471
how out of place
is a wooden barrel

36:48.473 --> 36:51.074
gonna look in the place
called ghost town?

36:51.076 --> 36:54.110
<i>  Ghost town</i>
<i>  is an abandoned theme park</i>

36:54.112 --> 36:55.679
<i>  from the early '60s</i>

36:55.681 --> 36:57.113
and, you know,

36:57.115 --> 36:59.482
what makes ghost town
so ideal for us

36:59.484 --> 37:01.651
<i>  is it's behind a locked gate.</i>

37:01.653 --> 37:04.154
<i>  It has a road</i>
<i>  leading directly to it.</i>

37:04.156 --> 37:06.022
<i>  It's not accessible</i>
<i>  to the public,</i>

37:06.024 --> 37:07.591
and it's on a mountaintop.

37:07.593 --> 37:09.893
So for what we need it for,

37:09.895 --> 37:12.362
it's the perfect solution
to our problem.

37:12.364 --> 37:15.799
I ain't seeing no cowboys
since popcorn was still alive.

37:15.801 --> 37:17.434
Cowboy got his nickname,

37:17.436 --> 37:19.803
because he was a gunfighter
at ghost town.

37:19.805 --> 37:21.905
He was one of the first
employees there.

37:21.907 --> 37:23.573
<i>  He's always</i>
<i>  been the caretaker.</i>

37:23.575 --> 37:25.342
<i>  Every time</i>
<i>  it's changed hands,</i>

37:25.344 --> 37:27.043
they've always
entrusted cowboy

37:27.045 --> 37:29.546
with keys
and with the property.

37:29.548 --> 37:30.914
But, you know,
if anybody knows

37:30.916 --> 37:32.549
about ghost town, it's cowboy.

37:32.551 --> 37:34.451
He always told me
he's the first man

37:34.453 --> 37:37.220
to blaze a trail in there.

37:37.222 --> 37:38.955
Here comes his ford
pick him up truck.

37:38.957 --> 37:40.090
All right. Maybe.

37:40.092 --> 37:42.525
That sounds like
what a cowboy oughta drive.

37:42.527 --> 37:44.294
[cowboy] are you fellas lost?

37:44.296 --> 37:46.830
-Hello, old buddy.
-Lord, there's my buddy.

37:46.832 --> 37:48.665
-How you doing, old buddy?
-Hello there, cowboy.

37:48.667 --> 37:49.866
How you doing old buddy?

37:49.868 --> 37:51.101
I ain't seen you
in a long time.

37:51.103 --> 37:52.235
I ain't seen you in 15 years.

37:52.237 --> 37:54.237
Well, I ain't
no purdier, son.

37:54.239 --> 37:55.605
Well, let me ask you
a question.

37:55.607 --> 37:57.140
Just lay it on me, brother.

37:57.142 --> 38:00.443
Now your role as a gunfighter
in ghost town.

38:00.445 --> 38:02.912
-Yeah.
-Actually bought you a part

38:02.914 --> 38:04.648
in the hollywood movie
<i> of deliverance , then?</i>

38:04.650 --> 38:06.149
<i>  Deliverance.</i>

38:06.151 --> 38:08.551
<i>  Cowboy's claim to fame,</i>
<i>  I guess,</i>

38:08.553 --> 38:11.888
he was a character
<i> in the movie deliverance.</i>

38:11.890 --> 38:13.356
Yeah. On the show
was jon voight

38:13.358 --> 38:14.991
-and burt reynolds.
-Yeah.

38:14.993 --> 38:18.995
And all them,
and I went to hollywood.

38:18.997 --> 38:20.897
<i> [mark] he was one</i>
<i>  of the mountaineer men</i>

38:20.899 --> 38:23.199
<i>  that had the encounter</i>

38:23.201 --> 38:25.068
<i>  with ned beatty's</i>
<i>  character in the movie,</i>

38:25.070 --> 38:27.470
which wasn't
a very pretty scene.

38:27.472 --> 38:29.606
I did have my two
front teeth out

38:29.608 --> 38:31.207
when they done the movie
<i>  deliverance.</i>

38:31.209 --> 38:33.343
<i>  Cowboy's most famous line</i>

38:33.345 --> 38:36.012
is "you sure got
a pretty mouth, boy."

38:36.014 --> 38:37.881
of all the lines
in that movie,

38:37.883 --> 38:39.449
that one sticks with you.

38:39.451 --> 38:42.719
-He's an icon.
-What do you need me for?

38:42.721 --> 38:44.254
-Uh...
-Well,

38:44.256 --> 38:47.157
we think you're the only one
that may be able to help us.

38:47.159 --> 38:49.659
-Well, if I can, I will.
-I know you will.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.494
We wanna get in up there
on top of the mountain,

38:51.496 --> 38:53.063
at the old ghost town.

38:53.065 --> 38:55.065
What are you going up
there for in that old place?

38:55.067 --> 38:57.434
Well, you know
that man,

38:57.436 --> 39:00.070
popcorn, and mark, all of us,
you know what we's into.

39:00.072 --> 39:01.971
I know what you're into.
I know.

39:01.973 --> 39:04.007
You know it don't hurt us any
by the fact

39:04.009 --> 39:07.310
that cowboy was friends
with popcorn sutton.

39:07.312 --> 39:09.279
<i>  We'll tell him</i>
<i>  what we have in mind.</i>

39:09.281 --> 39:11.414
<i>  We don't wanna keep</i>
<i>  any secrets from him.</i>

39:11.416 --> 39:13.416
We got some barrels
we wanna take up there

39:13.418 --> 39:15.218
-and let them age.
-I see.

39:15.220 --> 39:16.252
Yeah.

39:16.254 --> 39:18.054
The weather changes
up there are drastic.

39:18.056 --> 39:19.222
-Oh, yeah.
-And we're wanting to...

39:19.224 --> 39:20.690
We're wanting to age
our liquor up there,

39:20.692 --> 39:22.325
and you know
as well as anybody

39:22.327 --> 39:24.060
when that...
When that weather changes,

39:24.062 --> 39:25.462
-that barometric pressure...
-Oh.

39:25.464 --> 39:27.230
Drops, that liquor
goes in all that wood.

39:27.232 --> 39:28.531
And makes it work there.

39:28.533 --> 39:29.799
And we're gonna try
to set it somewhere

39:29.801 --> 39:32.302
where it'd wobble around like,
you know, it's almost...

39:32.304 --> 39:33.903
And the wind blows
up here, yeah.

39:33.905 --> 39:36.072
And we need
that weather changing

39:36.074 --> 39:38.174
-drastic every day or so.
-That's good.

39:38.176 --> 39:39.609
What's the weather like
up there?

39:39.611 --> 39:41.211
-Does it change quick?
-Oh, lord,

39:41.213 --> 39:43.580
it can be hot today
and cold tomorrow

39:43.582 --> 39:45.048
and the wind would be blowing,

39:45.050 --> 39:47.517
that's what you need,
the wind blowing and...

39:47.519 --> 39:50.120
These are the things
that we wanted to hear.

39:50.122 --> 39:52.155
This is what
we're looking for.

39:52.157 --> 39:54.224
We know that it'd be
safe up there because...

39:54.226 --> 39:55.525
-Yeah.
-You know,

39:55.527 --> 39:57.327
-nobody can get to it.
-Yeah.

39:57.329 --> 39:59.529
And the thing that we
want more than anything...

39:59.531 --> 40:00.764
-What?
-We want you

40:00.766 --> 40:02.432
to be the only one
that knows that they're there.

40:02.434 --> 40:04.868
Yeah. You know why?
It's none of my business.

40:04.870 --> 40:07.670
I know. Well, we trust you
with everything we got.

40:07.672 --> 40:09.739
Do you care to let us in
up there and...

40:09.741 --> 40:11.574
I'll let you in
and let you out.

40:11.576 --> 40:13.376
Ain't nobody gonna know.

40:13.378 --> 40:16.246
I know where to turn the
cameras off and turn them on.

40:16.248 --> 40:17.881
We appreciate that.

40:17.883 --> 40:20.150
Cowboy said yes
and I couldn't be any happier.

40:20.152 --> 40:23.019
The mayor of this town handed
me the keys to the city.

40:23.021 --> 40:25.955
[cowboy speaking]

40:28.660 --> 40:30.360
now, you'd go off
like a rocket.

40:32.197 --> 40:34.197
-Yup.
-[cowboy speaking]

40:36.234 --> 40:38.802
you can just follow me up.

40:38.804 --> 40:40.103
That sounds like a plan.

40:40.105 --> 40:41.371
We'll follow right behind you,
old buddy.

40:41.373 --> 40:42.572
All right.
You follow behind me.

40:42.574 --> 40:43.840
You know,
we don't know exactly

40:43.842 --> 40:45.275
what we're looking for,

40:45.277 --> 40:47.777
but getting in the gate's
half the battle.

40:47.779 --> 40:50.480
We'll have to fix old cowboy
up a little bit of alchy-hall.

40:50.482 --> 40:53.082
Yes, we will. Cowboy said yes.

40:53.084 --> 40:56.619
Under his conditions he has
to let us in and let us out.

40:56.621 --> 40:58.555
Cowboy, thank you, old buddy.
We'll be in touch.

40:58.557 --> 41:00.123
Yeah. All right. Well,
take care, you boys.

41:00.125 --> 41:01.458
-All right.
-And I'm watching.

41:01.460 --> 41:02.792
All right.
Hit the leak here baby, man.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.027
We got access.

41:04.029 --> 41:04.928
We're in the middle
of nowhere,

41:04.930 --> 41:05.995
that's the main thing.

41:05.997 --> 41:08.798
[country music playing]

41:08.800 --> 41:10.733
we feel like we just
got the key to the kingdom,

41:10.735 --> 41:11.935
so to speak.

41:15.407 --> 41:16.539
Wow.

41:16.541 --> 41:18.408
Damn, this is
a lot of memories.

41:18.410 --> 41:20.777
It was a big deal to get come
up here when we was a kid.

41:20.779 --> 41:22.846
We're about to enter
the emerald city

41:22.848 --> 41:26.049
as far as whisky aging
we hope.
