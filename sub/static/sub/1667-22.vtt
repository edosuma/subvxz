00:01.156 --> 00:02.725
<i>Previously on "The Originals"...</i>

00:02.726 --> 00:03.956
Davina, the covens
need a leader.

00:03.957 --> 00:05.822
I'm only doing this because
you said it will give me

00:05.823 --> 00:07.524
the power I need
to bring back Kol.

00:07.525 --> 00:09.726
I accept the role
of regent to our people.

00:09.727 --> 00:13.062
I die, and then I wake up
in my true body.

00:14.631 --> 00:16.560
Sacred soil, viking ash.

00:16.561 --> 00:19.339
Did you think that your blood
was the key to my demise?

00:19.340 --> 00:20.852
You're supposed
to be guarding Hayley.

00:20.853 --> 00:22.157
She and Jackson took hope,

00:22.158 --> 00:23.564
and you will not
find them, brother.

00:23.565 --> 00:26.579
You helped Hayley
escape with my daughter.

00:26.580 --> 00:29.078
Uh!
Aagh!

00:31.615 --> 00:34.017
Dahlia: I want power.
I am owed hope's.

00:34.018 --> 00:35.722
You will get
to raise your daughter,

00:35.723 --> 00:38.114
and I will channel the magic
that has been promised to me,

00:38.115 --> 00:40.357
and in so doing, I would help
hope to hone her craft

00:40.358 --> 00:42.258
that you couldn't
possibly comprehend.

00:42.260 --> 00:44.854
I'm glad to see you made
the right decision.

00:44.855 --> 00:46.029
We need to hurry.

00:46.030 --> 00:48.765
Agh! Ah!

00:48.766 --> 00:50.199
What are you doing to us?

00:50.201 --> 00:51.401
Klaus: The Crescent curse.

00:51.402 --> 00:53.814
Now you will be trapped
in wolf form.

00:53.815 --> 00:56.106
He needs her to trust him so
he can do what he needs to do.

00:56.107 --> 00:59.441
He told me her secret.
I know how we can kill Dahlia.

01:06.716 --> 01:10.085
[Hope fusses]

01:11.921 --> 01:14.556
You're quiet.

01:14.557 --> 01:16.124
Are you having misgivings?

01:16.126 --> 01:17.593
I was just looking
for a polite way

01:17.594 --> 01:20.096
to ask what the hell
is taking so long.

01:20.097 --> 01:23.533
Well, we can begin now.

01:23.534 --> 01:25.101
Once we're linked,
I'll no longer

01:25.102 --> 01:27.469
have to sleep
for 100 years again.

01:27.471 --> 01:29.539
Your concerns for
my status will ease,

01:29.540 --> 01:32.407
and I will finally
be able to focus on hope.

01:33.976 --> 01:36.612
I will only need a single drop

01:36.613 --> 01:42.652
of her blood, and then her
power shall be mine, also.

01:42.653 --> 01:44.820
What do you want
to do about Freya?

01:44.821 --> 01:46.656
She served her purpose.

01:46.657 --> 01:48.691
So tonight...

01:48.692 --> 01:51.460
At the moon's apex,
I'll end her life,

01:51.461 --> 01:53.962
and once our link is severed,

01:53.964 --> 01:55.631
the bond that I share
with your daughter

01:55.632 --> 01:57.266
will become permanent.

01:57.267 --> 02:01.002
Best get on with it, then.

[Slurp]

02:33.169 --> 02:35.871
So now that you have healed...

02:35.872 --> 02:39.006
What do you mean,
Niklaus had a plan?

02:39.008 --> 02:45.047
We had a plan, a plan
he has mercilessly destroyed!

02:45.048 --> 02:48.183
Your plan wouldn't
have worked, Elijah.

02:48.184 --> 02:51.520
When Klaus got into my head,
he said your plan would fail.

02:51.521 --> 02:53.688
So he had to enact
one of his own.

02:53.690 --> 02:55.290
And what might that be?

02:55.291 --> 02:57.159
He has to get her
to link to him.

[Chanting]

Elijah: My brother wishes to
bind himself to our enemy?

03:18.414 --> 03:19.748
She'll be virtually
indestructible.

03:19.749 --> 03:22.751
He said I ha to convince you
that everything he had to do

03:22.752 --> 03:24.052
he had to do alone.

03:24.053 --> 03:25.420
You had the wrong ingredients

03:25.421 --> 03:27.355
to kill Dahlia,
and he has to buy time

03:27.356 --> 03:29.057
before he finds the right ones.

03:29.058 --> 03:30.959
How?

Ohh...

03:44.406 --> 03:46.774
With your strength,

03:46.775 --> 03:50.845
I will never need to sleep
for a century again.

03:50.846 --> 03:54.715
Well, perhaps one more nap.

It can't end this way.

04:49.671 --> 04:51.805

04:57.445 --> 04:59.513
Ah! Well, I have
always been a sucker

04:59.514 --> 05:02.982
for a good display of strength.

05:02.984 --> 05:05.953
Fair warning, if you're
still compelled to kill me,

05:05.954 --> 05:07.820
you've got a whole new
fight on your hands.

05:08.922 --> 05:11.525
That was one hell of a gamble.

05:11.526 --> 05:13.526
I didn't have much choice.

05:15.162 --> 05:18.599
With Klaus as the dealer,
I expect a crappy hand.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.033
And it's not just a bad hand.

05:20.034 --> 05:21.168
He rigged the game.

05:21.169 --> 05:22.703
He compelled me to hurt you

05:22.704 --> 05:24.637
because he knows
what you mean to me.

Well, this should be good.

05:46.893 --> 05:48.595
I am sorry about your friend.

05:48.596 --> 05:49.930
Are you?

05:49.931 --> 05:51.164
I'm not condoning
Klaus' actions.

05:51.165 --> 05:53.300
I'm trying to help you.

05:53.301 --> 05:55.735
All I know is, Klaus will do
whatever he has to do for...

05:55.736 --> 05:58.370
Klaus will do whatever
he has to do for Klaus.

05:58.372 --> 06:01.041
Now Hayley is not
answering her phone.

06:01.042 --> 06:02.709
Now, what has he done?

06:02.710 --> 06:05.678
Rebekah: Don't blame
the messenger.

06:05.679 --> 06:08.347
Rebekah.

06:09.749 --> 06:12.919
Looks like Niklaus had a lot
on his to-do list last night,

06:12.920 --> 06:14.087
and as for Hayley...

06:14.088 --> 06:15.355
What is it?

06:15.356 --> 06:16.890
When Klaus attacked me,
he stole the spell

06:16.891 --> 06:18.858
that I used on
the Crescent wolves.

06:18.859 --> 06:22.929
So he would condemn her
to the body of a beast?

06:22.930 --> 06:24.697
Elijah, listen to me.

06:24.698 --> 06:26.399
Hayley will be human
once a month.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.234
We will find her,
and we will help her.

06:28.235 --> 06:29.435
No.

06:29.436 --> 06:32.472
We need to focus on those
who need saving today.

06:32.473 --> 06:34.006
Freya called.

06:34.007 --> 06:36.242
Dahlia is incapacitated.

06:36.243 --> 06:39.579
They are two hours north at
orchard near Pearl River.

06:39.580 --> 06:41.146
She has hope.

06:41.148 --> 06:42.314
[Whosh]

06:45.585 --> 06:47.719
[Hope crying]

06:48.621 --> 06:49.788
[Whoosh]

06:50.957 --> 06:53.693
Well, my adage holds.

06:53.694 --> 06:56.095
Nothing good ever happens
in a clearing in the woods.

06:56.096 --> 06:59.632
Nothing good ever happens where
my brother is concerned,

06:59.633 --> 07:02.100
with one exception.

07:02.102 --> 07:03.769
[Fussing]

07:03.770 --> 07:05.204
How is she?

07:05.205 --> 07:08.908
She's a Mikaelson.
She's resilient.

07:08.909 --> 07:12.044
When I woke,
they were like this.

07:12.045 --> 07:14.946
Rebekah tells me Klaus has
a plan to kill Dahlia,

07:14.948 --> 07:18.150
that he knew
our plan would not work.

07:18.151 --> 07:21.821
Yes. According to him,
our ingredients were incorrect.

07:21.822 --> 07:25.124
Niklaus infiltrated
Dahlia's mind.

07:25.125 --> 07:27.493
You didn't break her heart.

07:27.494 --> 07:30.062
We needed the blood of
the witch she loved most,

07:30.063 --> 07:33.064
and you were not that witch.

07:33.066 --> 07:36.334
That honor belongs
to our beloved mother.

07:37.803 --> 07:40.673
Se we need Esther's blood.

07:40.674 --> 07:42.541
Well, that's impossible.

07:42.542 --> 07:43.808
I killed her.

07:43.810 --> 07:47.146
One incarnation.

07:47.147 --> 07:50.381
Our mother is buried
in New Orleans.

07:51.917 --> 07:55.219
Niklaus wants us to revive
the original body.

08:03.562 --> 08:06.298
Earth magic.

08:06.299 --> 08:09.768
Ah, who taught you this?

08:09.769 --> 08:11.703
Closest thing I had
to a teacher...

08:11.704 --> 08:14.306
The guy I'm bringing back.

08:14.307 --> 08:16.475
Now, when you became regent,
our ancestors gave you

08:16.476 --> 08:19.211
a one-time-only access
to their power.

08:19.212 --> 08:22.814
Now, are you sure you want to
use that on Kol Mikaelson?

08:22.815 --> 08:24.716
I've already made up my mind.

08:24.717 --> 08:25.984
Spell's almost done.

08:25.985 --> 08:27.519
I just use the power
of the spirits

08:27.520 --> 08:29.721
to turn dirt and ash
into flesh and bone,

08:29.722 --> 08:32.457
though maybe I should've
worn an apron. Ha!

08:32.457 --> 08:34.326
Look, Davina Claire.
You want my advice?

08:34.327 --> 08:35.727
As someone who has just been put

08:35.727 --> 08:37.828
through the Mikaelson
meat grinder, be careful.

08:37.830 --> 08:39.563
Kol's not like his brothers.

08:39.565 --> 08:41.232
They all turn on each other.

08:41.232 --> 08:43.368
"I against my brother,
my brother and I

08:43.369 --> 08:45.570
against the infidel."

08:45.571 --> 08:47.172
What does that mean?

08:47.173 --> 08:51.009
It means that families fight,
but when push comes to shove,

08:51.010 --> 08:56.481
you can always trust a Mikaelson
to back another Mikaelson.

08:56.482 --> 08:59.783
So you watch your back.

09:02.287 --> 09:05.023
Nik is demented.

09:05.024 --> 09:06.558
Are we really
to dig up our mother,

09:06.559 --> 09:08.826
burn her to ash,
swap said ash for Kol's,

09:08.827 --> 09:10.995
and then trick Davina
into using up her last chance

09:10.996 --> 09:12.897
to bring someone
back from the dead,

09:12.898 --> 09:15.867
not to mention we lose
the opportunity to save Kol

09:15.868 --> 09:17.869
if Davina doesn't
turn us inside out?

09:17.870 --> 09:20.037
Or we dig a deep hole
and leave both our problems

09:20.038 --> 09:21.571
at the bottom of it.

09:21.573 --> 09:24.442
I say we choose a more
permanent option...

09:24.443 --> 09:26.711
Find the white oak stake,
kill Klaus.

09:26.712 --> 09:28.079
Dahlia dies with him.

09:28.080 --> 09:29.447
Oh, yeah, and so do I

09:29.448 --> 09:31.715
and every other vampire
that Klaus has turned.

09:31.717 --> 09:34.151
[Trickling]

09:34.152 --> 09:40.151
The dagger.

09:50.401 --> 09:51.969
We have no choice but to finish

09:51.970 --> 09:54.270
the task that Niklaus has set.

10:06.110 --> 10:09.447
Oh, isn't this
lovely... fresh air,

10:09.448 --> 10:11.782
the birds are singing
in the trees,

10:11.783 --> 10:14.451
perfect day to dig up
mommie dearest's corpse.

10:14.453 --> 10:17.388
Perfect day to carry out
the assignment of a lunatic.

10:17.389 --> 10:18.556
What's that saying...

10:18.557 --> 10:21.559
A madman often speaks the truth?

10:21.560 --> 10:22.860
Can't help but think
we should be using

10:22.861 --> 10:25.963
this opportunity to raise
Kol, and not this daft bitch.

10:25.964 --> 10:27.997
You speak as if it's
a foregone conclusion.

10:27.999 --> 10:31.035
Let's not forget, we still
have to deceive Davina Claire.

10:31.036 --> 10:34.805
So perhaps we steal a page
from Niklaus' playbook.

10:34.806 --> 10:36.540
She might yet help us

10:36.541 --> 10:39.176
if she has no idea
that she is helping us.

10:39.177 --> 10:43.680
I said I'd stay in that witch
body until I saved Kol.

10:45.449 --> 10:49.620
Now I've broken my promise,
and I am actively conspiring

10:49.621 --> 10:51.221
to Shanghai Davina
of her one chance

10:51.222 --> 10:53.323
to bring him back herself.

10:53.324 --> 10:55.259
I feel like a traitor.

10:55.260 --> 10:57.661
You are not to blame.

10:57.662 --> 11:00.197
It's not just my promise to Kol.

11:00.198 --> 11:02.432
Now, because of Nik's spite,

11:02.433 --> 11:05.802
I am once again
built to take life,

11:05.803 --> 11:08.171
robbed of the chance
to create it.

11:11.775 --> 11:16.880
Luv, he stole from you, too.

11:16.881 --> 11:20.149
Gia was innocent.

11:21.986 --> 11:24.855
Innocence does not
do well with our family.

11:24.856 --> 11:27.691
She's not the only thing
Nik stole from you last night.

11:27.692 --> 11:29.326
Oh, Hayley was never
mine to steal.

11:29.327 --> 11:30.995
Elijah, it hurts me
to see you pretend

11:30.996 --> 11:35.032
you don't deserve happiness,
that you don't deserve her.

11:35.033 --> 11:36.834
And what about you, sister?

11:36.835 --> 11:39.268
Where is your happiness?

11:44.808 --> 11:47.777
I suppose it's a family trait.

11:48.796 --> 11:52.915
Everything we love
we turn to ash.

11:57.680 --> 12:00.757
Elijah said Klaus kept
Kol's ashes in a blue urn.

12:00.758 --> 12:02.993
What he didn't do
was narrow the field.

12:02.994 --> 12:05.996
Heaven forbid one thing not be
a damn secret in this family.

12:05.997 --> 12:07.496
Yet, despite your anger,
here you are,

12:07.498 --> 12:09.132
casting your lot with Klaus.

12:09.133 --> 12:10.600
Is that because you believe
his plan's going to work?

12:10.601 --> 12:13.003
That is the Mikaelson paradox.

12:13.004 --> 12:17.474
You want to love and kill each
other all at the same time.

12:17.475 --> 12:20.476
[Books clatter]

12:51.984 --> 12:54.576
Ha ha ha!

12:54.578 --> 12:57.246
Look who got lucky.

13:03.086 --> 13:05.722
Either you have a curious
definition of "luck,"

13:05.723 --> 13:07.857
or someone got to those
ashes before we did.

13:07.858 --> 13:09.125
All right.

13:09.126 --> 13:10.426
We better find a way
to stop that dagger

13:10.427 --> 13:12.362
from melting
because if the thief

13:12.363 --> 13:15.664
is who I think it is,
we've got a problem.

13:18.167 --> 13:23.004
It's gonna be weird, seeing
you with your original face.

13:28.938 --> 13:32.981
He was a handsome
one, my brother.

13:44.693 --> 13:46.362
So much for your big promise

13:46.363 --> 13:48.164
to stay a witch
till we got Kol back.

13:48.165 --> 13:49.799
He is my brother,
and I have loved him

13:49.800 --> 13:52.802
many lifetimes longer than you
have been on this earth.

13:52.803 --> 13:55.271
I will stop at nothing
to get Kol back,

13:55.272 --> 13:57.472
no matter what flesh I'm in.

13:58.908 --> 14:03.078
I'm sorry.
So what happened?

14:03.079 --> 14:04.980
Nik happened.

14:04.981 --> 14:06.649
I suppose he thinks
I'm more durable

14:06.650 --> 14:09.918
in this body,
and he is probably right,

14:09.919 --> 14:12.488
given we're up against Dahlia.

14:12.489 --> 14:15.890
That's why I'm here.
I need your help.

14:15.892 --> 14:18.527
What do you want me to do?

14:18.528 --> 14:21.530
There is only one witch
strong enough to stop Dahlia,

14:21.531 --> 14:24.133
and that is
my very dead mother Esther.

14:24.134 --> 14:26.168
I need you to use
your power as regent

14:26.169 --> 14:27.569
to bring her back.
No.

14:27.570 --> 14:29.171
I only get one shot at this.

14:29.172 --> 14:30.605
I'm using it to bring back Kol.

14:30.607 --> 14:31.874
Please, luv.

14:31.875 --> 14:34.710
I promise you, we will
find another way.

14:34.711 --> 14:36.378
Yaah!

14:36.379 --> 14:38.947
You are all liars.

14:38.948 --> 14:40.282
Aah!

14:40.283 --> 14:41.984
I'm gonna bring back
the only one of you

14:41.985 --> 14:44.545
who has ever meant anything.

14:47.141 --> 14:49.190
[Chanting]

14:59.968 --> 15:02.304
It's no use.

15:02.305 --> 15:04.372
I can't slow her magic.

15:04.373 --> 15:06.907
Everything I'm trying fails.

15:07.995 --> 15:12.913
[Whispering voices and creaking]

15:20.674 --> 15:23.490
There's got to be
a way to kill her.

15:27.097 --> 15:29.930
There is.
No. Freya!

15:29.932 --> 15:32.900
Ah! Uh!

15:46.147 --> 15:48.648
[Chanting]

15:54.958 --> 15:57.190
Freya, we can find another way.

15:57.192 --> 15:59.760
I'm sorry, but I see
no other way.

15:59.761 --> 16:02.429
[Chanting]

16:05.333 --> 16:07.834
[Whoosh]

16:09.303 --> 16:11.339
Marcel: Ah! No! No! No!

16:11.340 --> 16:13.307
You kill him, you kill me, too!

16:13.308 --> 16:16.043
I don't want to kill you.

16:16.044 --> 16:19.713
I don't want to kill him.

16:20.948 --> 16:24.150
[Crackling]

16:29.326 --> 16:35.325
This is the family I longed
for, but, because of her,

16:37.199 --> 16:40.667
I'll forever be alone.

16:44.004 --> 16:45.538
Sister...

16:56.145 --> 16:57.984
Uh!

17:10.826 --> 17:13.199
Who the hell are you?

17:22.457 --> 17:24.054
[Bird caws]

17:27.191 --> 17:29.126
What did you do?

17:29.127 --> 17:31.595
Elijah: It wasn't Rebekah.

17:33.030 --> 17:35.433
Rather simple matter, actually.

17:35.434 --> 17:37.368
Davina: So much
for your big promise

17:37.369 --> 17:39.203
to stay a witch
till we got Kol back.

17:39.204 --> 17:40.771
Rebekah: He is my brother,
and I have loved him

17:40.772 --> 17:43.574
many lifetimes longer than you
have been on this earth.

17:43.575 --> 17:45.943
I will stop at nothing
to get Kol back.

17:45.944 --> 17:48.813
That was my only chance.

17:48.814 --> 17:50.848
That was Kol's only chance.

17:50.849 --> 17:52.816
Now I know why he hates you.

17:52.818 --> 17:55.719
Agh...
I'm so sorry, luv.

17:55.720 --> 17:59.573
I promise we'll get Kol
back, just not today.

18:00.824 --> 18:03.494
Welcome back, mother.

18:03.495 --> 18:05.629
I'm almost impressed by
the lengths you'd go to

18:05.630 --> 18:11.629
for your little girl, though
not enough to let bygones be.

18:13.804 --> 18:16.940
We are still linked, dear aunt.

18:16.941 --> 18:20.943
You may not want to punish me
with that particular weapon.

18:20.945 --> 18:23.914
Hmm, I made sure
that the link between us

18:23.915 --> 18:26.315
melted along with that dagger...

18:28.952 --> 18:31.688
Meaning...

18:31.689 --> 18:34.857
I'm quite free to kill you.

18:34.859 --> 18:35.992
D'aagh!

18:43.634 --> 18:45.301
[Hope crying]

18:46.670 --> 18:48.270
[Crying continues]

18:56.980 --> 18:59.950
Marcel: Why didn't
she take hope?

18:59.951 --> 19:02.852
Because all she needed
was a drop of her blood.

19:02.854 --> 19:04.154
Unfortunately, I have no idea

19:04.155 --> 19:05.956
where the vile harpy
has fled to.

19:05.957 --> 19:07.691
All right. Go.
Get hope someplace safe.

19:07.692 --> 19:09.960
I'll track down your witch,
and when this is over,

19:09.961 --> 19:11.561
you and I are gonna settle up.

19:11.562 --> 19:13.196
Provided we survive
what's to come tonight,

19:13.197 --> 19:15.364
I look forward to it.

19:17.467 --> 19:21.805
Davina, are you ok?
I sensed something was wrong.

19:21.806 --> 19:23.840
Elijah hijacked my spell.

19:23.841 --> 19:25.842
But you're all right.

19:25.843 --> 19:27.644
I'm not ok.

19:27.645 --> 19:30.346
I'm furious, and I can
do something about it.

19:30.347 --> 19:31.681
I am regent of all 9 covens.

19:31.682 --> 19:33.316
I will turn every single witch

19:33.317 --> 19:35.118
against that family
until they're broken.

19:35.119 --> 19:36.786
Marcel: Fair enough.

19:36.787 --> 19:39.789
All I ask is that the war
wait one day, just one day.

19:39.790 --> 19:41.925
What are you doing here?

19:41.926 --> 19:43.593
You're right.

19:43.594 --> 19:45.561
You're learning what
I've known for over 200 years,

19:45.562 --> 19:47.230
that if you're not a Mikaelson,

19:47.231 --> 19:49.232
you're cannon fodder,
but right now,

19:49.233 --> 19:51.734
their problem is my problem.

19:51.735 --> 19:54.170
I need you to find Dahlia.

19:54.171 --> 19:56.873
You want me to help them.

19:56.874 --> 19:58.641
Dahlia wants to kill
them all, right?

19:58.642 --> 20:01.177
If Klaus dies, I die.
Josh dies.

20:01.178 --> 20:02.812
Everyone I've turned dies.

20:02.813 --> 20:07.516
Help me right now, and we all
live to fight another day.

20:16.425 --> 20:18.960
[Cell phone vibrates]

20:25.267 --> 20:27.570
Camille, I need your help.

20:27.571 --> 20:30.039
"Hello, Klaus." "Hello, Camille.

20:30.040 --> 20:31.540
"Thank you so much
for convincing

20:31.541 --> 20:33.876
my furious siblings to join
my Machiavellian plan."

20:33.877 --> 20:36.345
"Yeah. That was good times.
Oh, what did you say?

20:36.346 --> 20:37.847
"How is my neck?
It's healed.

20:37.848 --> 20:39.381
Thank you so much for asking."

20:39.382 --> 20:41.584
Now, you were saying?

20:41.585 --> 20:43.419
I had to make it seem
as if I cared for nothing,

20:43.420 --> 20:49.419
for no one, but you should
know that when I hurt you...

20:58.967 --> 21:02.237
Our battle is not yet won,
and I need you to protect

21:02.238 --> 21:04.439
the most important
thing in my life.

21:04.440 --> 21:09.044
I need you to do it here,
where magic is void,

21:09.045 --> 21:12.079
and I'm sorry.

21:15.083 --> 21:17.919
I will find a way to
make it up to you.

21:24.993 --> 21:28.263
Esther: Let me guess...
You brought me back

21:28.264 --> 21:30.599
from the dead to torture me.

21:30.600 --> 21:33.268
My dear mother,
we simply need your blood,

21:33.269 --> 21:35.270
but in the event that you should

21:35.271 --> 21:39.875
suffer horribly, I can't promise
I won't enjoy it immensely.

21:39.876 --> 21:42.310
Ah, mother, I've arrived
just in time

21:42.311 --> 21:45.013
for another of your deaths,
and, as much as I appreciate

21:45.014 --> 21:46.648
the front-row seat,
I'm afraid I'm going

21:46.649 --> 21:48.717
to have to postpone
the festivities.

21:48.718 --> 21:50.352
You're in excellent spirits.

21:50.353 --> 21:54.055
Lucky for you, as I'm the one
needed to save the day.

21:54.056 --> 21:55.390
Is that what it's called?

21:55.391 --> 21:57.192
Why not? My plan's
worked perfectly.

21:57.193 --> 21:59.194
Easy, Elijah.

21:59.195 --> 22:02.697
I can see your red door
swinging wide open,

22:02.698 --> 22:04.332
but our job's not yet done.

22:04.333 --> 22:05.867
Shall we kill her
and be done with it?

22:05.868 --> 22:07.702
To be clear,
I do want her blood,

22:07.703 --> 22:10.004
but I want it on this blade,

22:10.005 --> 22:11.539
which I've had bound
with the soil

22:11.540 --> 22:14.642
from Dahlia's homeland,
not to mention viking ash.

22:14.643 --> 22:16.978
Mother's demise
will have to wait.

22:16.979 --> 22:20.181
You see, I need her to
weaken Dahlia's defenses,

22:20.182 --> 22:22.216
bit of psychological warfare

22:22.217 --> 22:24.718
before I slaughter
the both of you.

22:24.720 --> 22:26.387
Ah, yes.

22:26.388 --> 22:29.657
You expect me to walk
willingly to my death.

22:29.658 --> 22:32.260
Oh, willing participation
would have been a bonus,

22:32.261 --> 22:33.895
but it's far from necessary.

22:33.896 --> 22:36.063
If needs be,
I'll drag you there myself.

22:36.064 --> 22:40.334
Yes, dear mother,
you do not have a choice.

22:40.335 --> 22:41.869
Then again, why should you be

22:41.870 --> 22:43.337
any different from
the rest of us?

marionette show.

gonna stand there

22:51.079 --> 22:52.912
and pretend you
don't need me to?

22:52.914 --> 22:54.849
The both of you have fought me

22:54.850 --> 22:58.518
at every turn, leaving me
no choice but to act alone.

23:01.176 --> 23:03.924
We're no strangers
to disagreements

23:03.925 --> 23:06.727
on the battlefield,
but we also have

23:06.728 --> 23:08.496

23:08.497 --> 23:11.064
whatever it takes
to win the war.

are part of some ruse.

This was punishment.

23:36.591 --> 23:39.526
Punishment?
What ever for?

23:39.527 --> 23:41.895
Perhaps the dagger
you put in my heart.

23:41.896 --> 23:44.531
You brought
that upon yourself. No.

23:44.532 --> 23:46.133
We have fought together
for centuries,

23:46.134 --> 23:52.133
and once again, to break your
enemy, you broke your family.

Well, know this.

you will no longer
see me by your side.

you to meet me,

have such a gorgeous guest.

Oh, yeah.

What do you feel like
you owe these people?

25:10.497 --> 25:13.367
You forgot, I have a few
psychology degrees

25:13.368 --> 25:16.236
before the family you're
so wrapped up in stole my body.

25:16.237 --> 25:17.770
So you're head-shrinking
me now. Is that it?

25:17.772 --> 25:19.639
No. I'm... I'm trying
to figure out why

25:19.640 --> 25:22.542
a smart, levelheaded
woman such as yourself

25:22.543 --> 25:24.010
would choose to stick
around a town that,

25:24.011 --> 25:26.012
to my eyes, seems to offer
you nothing but danger.

25:26.013 --> 25:27.881
I'm the last of my family line.

25:27.882 --> 25:29.849
The O'Connells have
a long legacy here.

25:29.850 --> 25:31.551
Uh-uh. Don't feed me
that legacy crap, Camille.

has ever seen,

25:38.025 --> 25:39.826
and yet still, I'm able
to walk away from magic

25:39.827 --> 25:41.994
because I know
that it's not good for me,

25:41.996 --> 25:43.863
just like Niklaus
and his whole clan

25:43.864 --> 25:45.265
are not good for you, Camille.

25:45.266 --> 25:47.199
So you're walking away, huh?

25:47.201 --> 25:48.835
More like you're dumping
your responsibilities

25:48.836 --> 25:51.004
on a teenager
who doesn't know any better.

25:51.005 --> 25:53.373
She knows better.
She knows.

25:53.374 --> 25:55.475
She knows a hell of a lot
more than she should,

25:55.476 --> 25:58.545
and if she's not careful,
she doesn't walk the right line,

the wickedest of them all.

26:02.483 --> 26:05.550
Then why would you leave
her without a teacher?

26:08.354 --> 26:11.090
Well, ok. Fair enough.
Pick a fight.

26:11.091 --> 26:14.961
Call me out, but, um, from one
head shrink to another,

26:14.962 --> 26:17.462
what is it that you're
deflecting from yourself?

26:18.564 --> 26:20.700
You want to know
why I stay in town?

26:20.701 --> 26:22.567
Yeah.

26:22.569 --> 26:25.505
Because... against every ounce

26:25.506 --> 26:27.440
of my better judgment,
my sanity,

26:27.441 --> 26:30.176
and my common sense...
It turns out,

26:30.177 --> 26:36.256
I have complicated
feelings for a monster.

26:38.384 --> 26:42.253
And does this monster have
complicated feelings for you?

26:42.255 --> 26:46.224
I think it's entirely
possible that he does, yeah.

26:51.263 --> 26:53.232
We're gonna need another bottle.

26:53.233 --> 26:54.934
Yeah.

26:54.935 --> 26:56.634
[Chuckles]

27:04.310 --> 27:09.715
Two centuries ago, this city
hung its traitors right here.

27:09.716 --> 27:11.717
I thought it only fitting

27:11.718 --> 27:14.520
that it be
your slaughtering grounds.

27:14.521 --> 27:16.288
Uh!

27:16.289 --> 27:19.382
[Panting]

27:21.527 --> 27:23.996
I actually pity you.

27:23.997 --> 27:26.165
Over the course of
our long lives together,

27:26.166 --> 27:28.834
I could see you were broken.

27:28.835 --> 27:30.969
I used to think it was my fault,

27:30.970 --> 27:36.641
but in time, I learned your
ability to love died long ago.

27:36.643 --> 27:39.244
Darkness isn't born, you know.

27:39.245 --> 27:41.680
It's created...

27:41.681 --> 27:44.182
By the snuffing out of a light.

27:44.183 --> 27:46.785
So, however you thought
you might mend me,

27:46.786 --> 27:48.854
please know you never could.

27:48.855 --> 27:52.456
Whenever I looked in your eyes,
I saw your mother,

27:52.458 --> 27:57.027
the sister who turned
my heart to stone...

27:59.131 --> 28:04.169
And with that stone,
I will crush

28:04.170 --> 28:07.171
every one of her children.

28:07.173 --> 28:10.242
Klaus: Isn't there a saying
about stones and glass houses?

28:10.243 --> 28:11.643
[Whoosh]

28:11.644 --> 28:13.445
Rebekah: In case the analogy
is lost on you,

28:13.446 --> 28:16.681
I believe my brother is calling
you a hypocritical bitch.

28:16.682 --> 28:20.284
Dahlia: Hmm, bringing vampires
to a witch fight.

28:20.286 --> 28:22.554
Someone hasn't
learned their lesson.

28:22.555 --> 28:24.989
Well, I can be a bit
thick sometimes...

28:24.990 --> 28:27.357
[Chains rattling]

28:31.529 --> 28:33.364
Although on this occasion,

28:33.365 --> 28:36.166
I'd say I took
your lesson to heart.

28:38.102 --> 28:41.071
[Chains clatter]

28:57.490 --> 28:59.683
My sister...

29:02.454 --> 29:04.088
In chains.

29:05.748 --> 29:09.094
Ha ha ha!

29:09.095 --> 29:13.732
Is... is she to be a gift
to buy your freedom?

29:13.733 --> 29:16.334
Because I brought something.

29:16.335 --> 29:19.303
[Thunder]

29:19.305 --> 29:21.172
One stake, 3 of us.

29:21.173 --> 29:22.641
Even if you don't hesitate,

29:22.642 --> 29:25.810
the other two will
rip you in half.

29:25.811 --> 29:31.316
Sound thinking
but small thinking.

29:31.317 --> 29:33.350
[Thunder]

29:34.903 --> 29:37.988
[Thunder]

29:45.872 --> 29:48.633
[Gasping]

29:48.634 --> 29:50.500
[Coughing]

29:55.214 --> 29:57.874
[Coughing continues]

30:00.136 --> 30:01.713
Ugh!

30:01.714 --> 30:04.014
[Coughing continues]

30:05.783 --> 30:07.552
You're killing them.

30:07.553 --> 30:09.887
[Coughing continues]

30:09.888 --> 30:12.457
Now, sister,
let us watch together

30:12.458 --> 30:15.927
as I burn your children
from the inside out.

30:15.928 --> 30:18.929
[Coughing continues]

30:22.784 --> 30:27.538
You still carry around
so much anger for me

30:27.539 --> 30:29.874
after all these years.

30:29.875 --> 30:31.542
You broke your vow.

30:31.543 --> 30:34.478
We were to stand together
always and forever,

30:34.479 --> 30:38.716
and you left to marry
that brutish viking imbecile.

30:38.717 --> 30:44.254
You ended my family,
and they were the result.

30:46.474 --> 30:48.091
Rebekah: No!

30:48.093 --> 30:50.126
[Siblings gagging]

30:51.980 --> 30:55.399
You call this my wrongdoing?

30:55.400 --> 31:01.646
You made me bargain away
my firstborn child, my daughter.

31:01.706 --> 31:06.042
Not just this firstborn,
but every firstborn,

31:06.044 --> 31:07.911
and even then, you found
a way to deny me that

31:07.912 --> 31:10.114
which you had sworn
would be mine.

31:10.115 --> 31:11.682
How do you think that felt?

31:11.683 --> 31:13.217
D'rrgh!

31:13.218 --> 31:15.585
Uh!

31:16.987 --> 31:19.422
[Gagging continues]

31:23.011 --> 31:29.010
Now, Esther, say good-bye to
the last of your children.

31:31.269 --> 31:33.803
[Gagging]

31:44.281 --> 31:47.450
Sister, wait. Wait.

31:47.451 --> 31:50.053
You've won, Dahlia.

31:50.054 --> 31:52.756
You have everything
you ever wanted,

31:52.757 --> 31:55.191
including the firstborn
of a new generation.

31:55.192 --> 31:59.329
You have bested us all.

31:59.330 --> 32:03.066
At least let me try
to make amends.

32:03.067 --> 32:05.735
Let me share with you
the glorious freedom

32:05.736 --> 32:09.772
that I have found in death.

32:11.350 --> 32:13.176
[Coughs]

32:13.177 --> 32:15.545
Raah!

32:15.546 --> 32:16.813
D'aagh!

32:16.814 --> 32:19.149
[Coughing]

32:19.150 --> 32:21.517
[Gagging]

32:21.518 --> 32:23.186
Elijah?

32:23.187 --> 32:25.396
Uh!
Ah!

32:26.699 --> 32:28.825
Rrr... aagh!

32:28.826 --> 32:31.827
[Both panting]

32:33.129 --> 32:35.365
Where are we?

32:35.366 --> 32:37.533
Where...

32:37.534 --> 32:39.669
What have you done?

32:39.670 --> 32:42.037
What I should've done
1,000 years ago...

32:44.874 --> 32:47.142
Stay by your side.

32:48.930 --> 32:50.680
When I saw my children willing

32:50.681 --> 32:52.982
to fight for one
another, dear sister,

32:52.983 --> 32:54.650
it is only now that I realize

32:54.651 --> 32:59.554
my more grievous sin...
Not standing by you.

33:02.091 --> 33:04.559
Please forgive me.

33:06.095 --> 33:08.763
Oh...

33:12.902 --> 33:16.604
Of course I forgive you.

33:40.662 --> 33:44.365
Seems we're officially orphans.

33:59.198 --> 34:01.933
[Wind whistling]

34:41.172 --> 34:43.172
[Trickling]

34:48.647 --> 34:51.917
Rebekah: The spoils of war, hey?

34:51.918 --> 34:54.185
A family tradition.

34:54.186 --> 34:55.954
Minus the family.

34:55.955 --> 34:57.654
Well, you're here.

34:57.656 --> 35:00.191
In the skin of your choosing,
no less.

35:00.192 --> 35:03.994
Well, poor you because that body
is such a hardship.

35:05.330 --> 35:06.731
Meanwhile, the rest
of the family

35:06.732 --> 35:08.366
enjoys the fruits of my labor.

35:08.367 --> 35:10.735
Freya has her freedom
from Dahlia,

35:10.736 --> 35:12.237
and Marcel will forgive me

35:12.238 --> 35:14.639
once I hand him back
the reins of the city.

35:14.640 --> 35:16.907
I was done with it, anyway.

35:16.909 --> 35:20.111
You would hand over your crown?

35:20.112 --> 35:21.679
And do what?

35:21.680 --> 35:25.016
Raise my daughter with
the help of my sisters,

35:25.017 --> 35:28.486
one big, happy family.

35:28.487 --> 35:30.922
Now, that does sound grand,

35:30.923 --> 35:32.924
minus the giant,
Elijah-sized hole

35:32.925 --> 35:34.826
in the room,
and whilst your sisters

35:34.827 --> 35:36.761
raise your child, what will

35:36.762 --> 35:39.129
the child's mother
be doing, exactly?

35:43.234 --> 35:48.872
This, dear brother, is not
what happiness looks like.

36:04.989 --> 36:06.690
You wanted to see me?

36:06.691 --> 36:10.628
I finally have the freedom
that I've always wanted,

36:10.629 --> 36:13.297
the ability to
choose my own fate.

36:13.298 --> 36:15.265
I thought you should
have the same.

36:27.411 --> 36:29.480
I've healed this body
and made it so that

36:29.481 --> 36:31.148
you can inhabit it once again.

36:31.149 --> 36:32.983
Now you can be
who you want to be,

36:32.984 --> 36:36.120
either a vampire or a witch.

36:36.121 --> 36:38.555
You have a choice.

36:38.556 --> 36:41.125
Why would you do this?

36:41.126 --> 36:45.261
Because you were the first
to see me as a sister,

36:45.263 --> 36:48.165
and since you spent so long
looking after your family,

36:48.166 --> 36:50.501
I thought, for once,
you deserve a sister

36:50.502 --> 36:52.702
to look after you.

36:55.172 --> 36:57.473
Oh. Hmm.

37:00.944 --> 37:04.314
[Cell phone vibrates]

37:04.315 --> 37:06.349
[Beep]

37:06.350 --> 37:12.349
So which did you choose, the new
version or the O.G. model?

37:21.531 --> 37:25.669
I decided not
to decide, not yet.

37:25.670 --> 37:27.804
I will use
the advantages this body has

37:27.805 --> 37:29.873
while I search for a way
to bring back Kol,

37:29.874 --> 37:32.207
and then who knows?

37:32.209 --> 37:36.145
And you? What will
you do, Marcel?

37:36.147 --> 37:41.050
Uh, I will try not to start
a war with your brother.

37:41.051 --> 37:44.687
Some things change.
Some never do.

37:44.688 --> 37:49.391
Well, here's one more constant.

38:16.953 --> 38:21.023
Klaus: '78, a good year.

38:21.024 --> 38:23.525
Crack one of those
open, would you?

38:23.527 --> 38:26.929
Let's commiserate my sister
leaving me... again.

38:26.930 --> 38:29.265
You have to stop
compelling the customers.

38:29.266 --> 38:30.966
I need the tips.

38:34.704 --> 38:36.105
[Chuckles]

38:36.106 --> 38:40.109
When I first got into town,
you handed me one of those.

38:40.110 --> 38:42.144
I had taken a shift
from another girl.

38:42.145 --> 38:45.581
If not for that, could've been
someone else standing here

38:45.582 --> 38:47.549
right now instead of me.

38:50.119 --> 38:54.123
You know, I prefer
to see it the other way.

38:54.124 --> 38:57.193
If it wasn't that night,
this bar, that $100 bill,

38:57.194 --> 39:02.965
it would've been Jackson
square staring at a painting

39:02.966 --> 39:08.903
or Frenchmen street
listening to jazz.

39:13.809 --> 39:15.977
I would have found you.

39:18.580 --> 39:21.516
Thank you...

39:22.951 --> 39:25.086
For the drink.

39:39.801 --> 39:42.303
[Footsteps]

39:56.117 --> 39:58.753
How is she?

39:58.754 --> 40:04.659
She's safe and well,
according to Freya.

40:04.660 --> 40:08.430
Hayley, I promise you, by
whatever means necessary,

40:08.431 --> 40:11.266
I will release you from this.

40:11.267 --> 40:15.203
I want you to make me
another promise, Elijah.

40:15.204 --> 40:18.339
I can't let Klaus be
the only thing that she knows.

40:18.340 --> 40:22.210
I need you to be there for her.

40:22.211 --> 40:26.813
Promise me that.
She needs you.

40:39.594 --> 40:45.593
Once upon a time, there was
a wolf king who fought a war

40:47.669 --> 40:51.037
for the most precious treasure
in all the kingdom...

40:52.240 --> 40:56.543
His beautiful,
little Princess...

40:57.378 --> 41:00.447
But victory came at a price...

41:01.382 --> 41:03.850
Allies lost...

41:06.254 --> 41:08.722
New enemies made...

41:14.295 --> 41:19.433
And so the wolf
king stood alone.

41:19.434 --> 41:22.536
Happily ever after it was not,

41:22.537 --> 41:28.242
but sometimes
even the worst endings

41:28.243 --> 41:30.811
are not really endings at all...

41:30.812 --> 41:33.279
[Footsteps]

41:43.390 --> 41:47.294
And you should know,
my littlest wolf,

41:47.295 --> 41:53.294
that, even when all seems
burnt to ash, in our story,

41:54.435 --> 41:57.927
there is always
another chapter to be told.
