<i>NARRA TOR: Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:02.635 --> 00:05.331
Look, I know I screwed up as a father,
but I'd like to be a good grandfather.

00:05.405 --> 00:08.067
Well, you should have thought of that
before you killed Jamie's great-uncle.

00:08.141 --> 00:10.769
- I passed on the Omaha job.
- Marvin.

00:10.844 --> 00:14.507
I feel like I'm good at what I do,
Millicent, and I'll just work hard

00:14.581 --> 00:16.606
and hope the station gives me
another shot.

00:16.683 --> 00:17.672
Are you sure?

00:17.751 --> 00:22.313
That I'm doing the right thing?
I don't know. But about us? Yeah. I'm sure.

00:22.589 --> 00:24.614
I trusted you, all right?

00:24.691 --> 00:26.886
- Quentin, you needed this.
- I needed this?

00:26.960 --> 00:28.723
You know what I needed? A scholarship.

00:28.795 --> 00:31.127
I needed you to keep your mouth shut,
that's what I needed.

00:31.197 --> 00:32.357
Millicent.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.330
They're giving me a baby.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.335
Lindsey, I love you.

00:39.406 --> 00:43.740
I love you, too, Luke, but it takes
more than love to build a marriage.

00:43.810 --> 00:45.641
I'm willing to learn.

00:52.385 --> 00:54.148
This is for you.

00:54.220 --> 00:57.451
You're giving me the beach house.
I don't want it.

00:59.192 --> 01:04.494
Son, I have a bad heart.
I have six months to live.

He didn't come to my birthday party.
Everyone else came.

02:08.995 --> 02:12.988
- I really wanted him to come.
- Yeah, I know you did, buddy.

02:13.066 --> 02:14.533
Your party was still pretty cool, right?

02:14.601 --> 02:17.331
Yeah, but Grandpa Dan said he missed me.

02:18.538 --> 02:19.527
(SIGH)

02:19.639 --> 02:22.836
Well, you know that old jersey
that you love so much?

02:24.043 --> 02:27.308
- That was from your Grandpa Dan.
- Really? I knew it!

Hey.

this birthday present.

(EX CLAIMING)

02:37.657 --> 02:39.784
Can I talk to you for a second?

02:39.859 --> 02:41.656
- He's dying, Hales.
- What?

02:41.728 --> 02:44.822
Dan needs a heart transplant.
He says it's his HCM.

02:44.898 --> 02:47.765
He's got six months to live,
maybe not even that.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.768
Do you believe him?
He's not even that old.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.236
I don't know. I mean, it's Dan.

02:52.305 --> 02:53.363
But he's even drawn up a will,

02:53.439 --> 02:55.771
and he's leaving us the beach house,
among other things.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.675
And this time he seemed scared.

02:59.445 --> 03:03.438
I mean, I've seen my father be
a lot of things, Hales, but never scared.

03:03.516 --> 03:05.006
Well, if it is true, at least now we know

03:05.084 --> 03:07.450
why he wants to spend so much time
with Jamie.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.351
Nothing like a ticking clock.

03:09.422 --> 03:13.222
Ticking clock or not,
Dan's not spending any time with Jamie.

03:17.463 --> 03:21.331
Come on, baby girl, give me a smile.

03:21.401 --> 03:26.202
Well, fine. Have it your way,
but we got a big week ahead of us, kid.

Tonight we meet the doctor
who's gonna make you all better.

Aunt Millicent's gonna watch you

03:49.829 --> 03:54.129
What, did you think I was gonna forget
something this important? 7:00, right?

03:54.200 --> 03:58.068
Yeah, 7:00 p.m.
But I appreciate the enthusiasm, Luke.

03:59.472 --> 04:02.407
I am kind of nervous
about the whole hospital thing.

04:02.475 --> 04:04.909
Not really a big fan of hospitals.

04:04.978 --> 04:08.470
- How's it going? Better?
- Yeah. I'm starting to get it down.

04:08.548 --> 04:11.073
She's sleeping through the night now.

04:11.150 --> 04:15.644
See? I told you you'd be a good mama.
Is it what you expected?

04:15.722 --> 04:17.349
It's a lot of work.

04:17.423 --> 04:21.291
A lot more than I ever thought it could be,
but she's so cute.

Oh, God,
that was like the best night's sleep ever.

04:25.498 --> 04:28.228
Luke! Hey. What are you doing here?

04:28.301 --> 04:30.633
He just came by
for Angie's pre-op appointment.

04:30.703 --> 04:32.637
Talk about a gentleman.

04:33.573 --> 04:36.303
Probably should've just called, eh?

04:37.944 --> 04:40.970
- Brooke, I'll pick you up later.
- Sounds good.

04:42.882 --> 04:44.213
Bye, Luke.

04:46.152 --> 04:47.141
You two.

04:48.755 --> 04:49.847
God.

04:53.393 --> 04:55.884
They're silly. Aren't they silly?

04:59.866 --> 05:01.493
He knew there was practice
this morning, right?

05:01.567 --> 05:02.932
I told him.

05:05.071 --> 05:06.197
Okay.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.206
Bring it in.

05:11.944 --> 05:15.607
So, as you can all see,
Q's out for six weeks.

05:15.682 --> 05:18.480
Which means we're gonna have to make it
to the playoffs without him.

05:18.551 --> 05:20.314
Every single one of you is
gonna have to step it up.

05:20.386 --> 05:23.617
Now, there's 12 games
between now and the playoffs.

05:24.490 --> 05:28.722
We can't afford to lose many.
Any questions?

05:31.998 --> 05:35.399
Hey, just because Quentin's injured
doesn't mean the season's over.

05:35.468 --> 05:38.301
Now, here's what I'm expecting
from each and every one of you.

05:38.371 --> 05:42.034
- Q, where you going?
- Ain't nothing here for me now, man.

05:43.776 --> 05:46.904
- Hey, Q, you can't just quit.
- Yeah, I just did.

05:57.490 --> 06:02.291
Mmm. Look what we got,
more squash and peas. Yummy.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.421
She loves it, go figure.

06:04.497 --> 06:08.866
Hey, about that. I just want you to know,
I am available to help with Angie.

06:08.935 --> 06:12.132
It's just my hair's been on fire trying to
get the new recording studio done, and...

06:12.205 --> 06:15.072
It's okay. You are excused from baby duty.

06:16.275 --> 06:20.143
Besides, I kind of like
having the time alone with Angie,

06:20.213 --> 06:22.044
so don't feel bad.

06:22.115 --> 06:25.881
And anyway, Angie's scared
of her creepy Aunt Peyton, isn't she?

06:25.952 --> 06:28.887
- Yes. We like Uncle Lucas better.
- Hey!

06:28.955 --> 06:31.924
I'm kidding! We're kidding, aren't we?
Yes, we are.

06:31.991 --> 06:34.482
I mean, it is pretty great
that he's helping out.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.529
- It's kind of <i>Mr. Mom,</i> but it's nice.
- It's cute.

06:37.597 --> 06:42.534
And anyway, he's still pining over Lindsey,
so I'm helping distract him.

06:42.602 --> 06:45.901
Yeah. Well, speaking of distractions,
I actually have to get going to the studio.

06:45.972 --> 06:47.030
Why? Who's recording?

06:47.106 --> 06:51.065
Oh, just this girl you might know.
Haley James Scott.

06:51.144 --> 06:55.342
Did you hear that, baby girl?
Haley James Scott's making music again.

06:55.415 --> 06:58.816

- Excuse me?

07:23.075 --> 07:25.635
That, or did you fix the salmon mousse
in the cafeteria?

07:25.711 --> 07:30.546
My sports on-air is sick as a dog.
He just booted all over the station floor.

07:30.616 --> 07:34.416
- And you want me to clean that up?
- No.

07:35.421 --> 07:39.687
Listen, I know we haven't spoken much
since I took over for Alice.

07:39.759 --> 07:44.719
- And I know you were close with her.
- Pretty close. Yeah.

07:44.797 --> 07:49.097
Anyway, I really like the remote piece
you did on the Ravens.

07:49.168 --> 07:51.068
So how would you like to fill in tomorrow?

07:51.137 --> 07:52.434
Really?

07:52.872 --> 07:55.739
- What about the weekend guy?
- He's okay.

07:55.808 --> 07:58.777
But then,
how would you get your big shot?

07:58.845 --> 08:03.646
I got three slots, 4:00, 5:00 and 6:00.
I need you to do sports for all three.

08:03.716 --> 08:05.707
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

08:07.620 --> 08:10.680
Oh, and Marvin, I heard
about your Omaha offer.

08:10.857 --> 08:13.417

It's Dan.

08:32.578 --> 08:33.977
He's dying.

08:35.347 --> 08:36.679
Right.

08:36.749 --> 08:38.943
I'm serious. It's something about his heart.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.611
He had Nathan out to the beach house
to tell him.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.678
- And Nathan believes him?
- I think so.

08:43.756 --> 08:48.193
At least, he seems pretty convinced.
Dan drafted up a will and everything.

08:49.128 --> 08:52.427
- What, you think he's lying?
- Of course he's lying!

08:53.032 --> 08:54.260

08:56.202 --> 09:00.901
All right, I'll get into it, okay?
But in the meantime, be careful. All right?

09:00.973 --> 09:03.441
Don't let him suck you and Nathan
back into his life.

09:03.509 --> 09:07.502
I know. I'm with you on that.
But what if he's telling the truth?

09:08.648 --> 09:10.775
What if he really is dying?

09:12.518 --> 09:16.147
Well, then all I have to say is,

09:16.322 --> 09:18.790
it couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

09:27.967 --> 09:31.698
- You'll get it back again, trust me.
- What are you doing here?

09:31.771 --> 09:33.898
You told me in the gym
you weren't trying to come back,

09:33.973 --> 09:36.203
but I know you are.
That's what I would do.

09:36.275 --> 09:38.607
- It's not a comeback.
- Sure.

09:38.678 --> 09:40.407
You know, Nathan,
you may just have to face the fact

09:40.479 --> 09:42.504
that you'll never be the same player
you once were.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.812
But that doesn't mean
you still won't be a great player.

09:44.884 --> 09:46.647
You just have to learn
how to play differently.

09:46.719 --> 09:49.916
Reinvent yourself.
The best players always find a way.

09:49.989 --> 09:52.856
- Okay, try again, but slow it down a step...
- Stop it.

09:52.925 --> 09:54.654
- Stop what?
- Following me.

09:54.727 --> 09:57.321
Trying to see Jamie. This. All of it.

09:58.397 --> 10:01.662
Dan, I don't care that you're dying, okay?
This isn't happening.

10:01.734 --> 10:03.326
We're done here.

10:05.104 --> 10:08.437
Nathan, don't hate me because I'm proud
of your accomplishments.

10:08.507 --> 10:12.341
Take it from someone who knows,
you don't wanna live a life of regret.

10:12.411 --> 10:16.711
It's not too late. You can have your dream.
You just have to really want it.

10:16.782 --> 10:20.843
Stop it! Okay? You don't get it, do you?
Just stop it. All of it.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.186
And leave my family alone.

10:38.971 --> 10:40.632
There. Check it out.

10:40.706 --> 10:44.233
How awesome is this, Haley?
It's Red Bedroom Studios.

10:44.310 --> 10:49.509
- Yeah, it's great.
- Hey. What's going on with you?

10:49.582 --> 10:54.076
Nothing. I'm fine. Just... Nothing.
The studio looks awesome.

10:54.153 --> 10:55.677
So, what is it?

10:58.124 --> 11:01.753
- Can I just ask you a personal question?
- Yeah, please do.

11:03.529 --> 11:05.690
If you had the chance
to get to know your real father,

11:05.765 --> 11:08.325
- would you want to?
- Oh, whoa.

11:08.801 --> 11:11.998
I mean, you know, before Ellie,
I probably would've said no,

11:12.071 --> 11:13.698
but she was awesome.

11:13.773 --> 11:17.732
And so, yeah, it does make me kind of
wonder about my real dad sometimes.

11:17.810 --> 11:21.109
But, you know, then again,
what if I meet him and I don't like him?

11:21.180 --> 11:23.842
So, sometimes I think it's just easier
not to know

11:23.916 --> 11:27.283
and go with my own idealized
version of him.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.446
- Yeah.
- Why do you ask?

11:33.392 --> 11:35.917
There's a chance Dan might be dying.

11:37.263 --> 11:40.460
Are you kidding? Does Nathan know?

11:40.533 --> 11:42.967
Yeah, Nathan and Lucas both know,
the problem is with Jamie.

11:43.035 --> 11:45.333
He is obsessed
with getting to know his grandfather,

11:45.404 --> 11:47.872
and if Dan's really sick,
he might not get the chance to do that.

11:47.940 --> 11:51.307
God, Haley, I'm sorry. That's tough, man.

11:51.377 --> 11:54.938
I mean, I will say
that getting to know Ellie changed my life.

11:55.014 --> 11:56.709
And I'm pretty sure
we wouldn't be standing here

11:56.782 --> 11:59.307
if it weren't for her.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.876
Then again, Ellie wasn't Dan Scott.

12:04.523 --> 12:09.222
- Well, you look healthy.
- Come on in, Lucas. Have a seat.

12:09.328 --> 12:12.354
No, that's okay, what I have to say,
I can say from right here.

12:12.431 --> 12:15.400
Well, suit yourself. But you of all people
should take this seriously.

12:15.468 --> 12:16.662
There's nothing wrong with my heart.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.567
And if I know you,
there's nothing wrong with yours, either.

12:18.637 --> 12:20.537
I wish that was true,

12:20.606 --> 12:24.098
but I've got the best cardiologist
money can buy, and even he can't help me.

12:24.176 --> 12:26.542
Dr. Thornton. Call him yourself.

12:26.612 --> 12:29.445
- I might just do that.
- Good.

12:29.515 --> 12:32.279
And when you do,
you'll find out that I'm not lying.

12:32.351 --> 12:35.752
Without a transplant,
I'll be dead within six months.

12:36.856 --> 12:39.882
But you're dead
to so many of us already, Dan.

12:40.326 --> 12:42.658
So really, what does it matter?

13:03.315 --> 13:05.442
So do you wanna put down
the piano scratch track first?

13:05.518 --> 13:08.487
- Yeah, that's perfect.
- Hey.

13:10.456 --> 13:13.983
Who would have thought that one day
we'd be in our own recording studio

13:14.059 --> 13:17.187
- making your next record together?
- On your label.

13:17.263 --> 13:20.824
It's great that you're really enjoying
your work so much, Peyton,

13:20.900 --> 13:24.165
just as long as you're not using it
to hide behind.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.833
What's that supposed to mean?

13:30.676 --> 13:35.010
Look, before the wedding, I told Lucas
that he shouldn't marry Lindsey.

13:36.982 --> 13:39.007
- Why?
- Because I just read his new novel,

13:39.084 --> 13:41.951
and when I did, I knew right away
that he was still in love with you,

13:42.021 --> 13:46.253
- whether he's ready to admit it or not.
- It's a book, okay?

13:46.325 --> 13:48.691
You can't draw those kind of conclusions
from a story.

13:48.761 --> 13:51.286
Really?
What about when I write my music?

13:51.363 --> 13:54.594
Some of my subconscious always ends up
sneaking into my lyrics somewhere.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.568
I don't even notice it until the song's done.

13:57.636 --> 13:59.763
I think Lucas is the same way
with his writing.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.534
Well, I watched him up on that altar,

14:01.607 --> 14:04.041
and it's very clear to me
where his heart lies,

14:04.109 --> 14:08.307
and if I can see it,
I'm not really sure why Lindsey can't.

14:08.380 --> 14:12.612
You know, it's unfair to Luke. He loves her.

14:15.588 --> 14:19.752
I think she's just afraid of the idea of you.
Your history with him.

14:21.126 --> 14:24.220
Think how you'd feel
if the roles were reversed.

14:28.500 --> 14:31.162
Hi, sorry if I kept you waiting.

14:31.237 --> 14:34.138
- Dr. Copeland. You must be Brooke Davis.
- Mmm.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.336
- Clothes, right?
- Yes.

14:36.408 --> 14:38.808
I thought you looked familiar.
Which must make you...

14:38.878 --> 14:41.938
- A friend. Lucas Scott.
- Great.

14:42.047 --> 14:45.574
So, I just wanted to run through
the surgical procedure,

14:45.651 --> 14:49.781
so you can know what to expect.
Are you familiar with Angie's condition?

14:49.855 --> 14:52.221
Not really.
She has a hole in her heart, right?

14:52.291 --> 14:56.284
She has a number of holes, actually.
But we're gonna fix them.

14:56.362 --> 14:58.091
We'll put Angie
under a general anesthesia,

14:58.163 --> 15:01.155
we'll stop her heart,
and then I'll do the repairs.

15:01.233 --> 15:04.134
You have to stop her heart? For how long?

15:04.203 --> 15:08.105
Two hours. Maybe longer,
depending on the extent of her condition.

15:08.173 --> 15:12.303
- Two hours?
- Yes, that's how we do it, Brooke.

15:12.378 --> 15:14.312
Angie will be on a heart and lung machine

15:14.380 --> 15:17.838
which will keep blood and oxygen
circulating in her body.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.942
Then I will graft skin
from another part of her heart

15:20.019 --> 15:21.509
and use it to fix the holes.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.578
How do you intend
to restart Angie's heart?

15:23.656 --> 15:27.114
After the repairs are complete,
we will use an electric shock,

15:27.192 --> 15:29.422
and once she's stabilized,
we'll take her to the ICU,

15:29.495 --> 15:30.792
and you'll be able to see her then.

15:30.863 --> 15:34.799
I know I don't have a choice here,
but this seems so dangerous.

15:34.900 --> 15:36.868
Is there some other way?

15:37.603 --> 15:39.332
I'm sorry, but, no,

15:39.405 --> 15:42.067
there is no other way
to correct Angie's condition.

15:42.141 --> 15:46.441
Dr. Copeland, what's Angie's prognosis
if she didn't have the surgery?

15:47.279 --> 15:49.406
A year, maybe two.

15:51.050 --> 15:52.517
And then what?

15:53.452 --> 15:54.851
She'll die.

16:03.796 --> 16:06.629
Look, Brooke, it's okay to be nervous.

16:06.699 --> 16:10.863
But I just... I want you to focus on
what a great thing it is

16:10.970 --> 16:15.498
- that you're doing for Angie.
- Okay. Thank you.

16:16.976 --> 16:21.174
So, if there are no further questions,
I will see you next week.

16:21.246 --> 16:25.774
Actually, there is one thing.
Do you happen to know a Dr. Thornton?

16:30.089 --> 16:32.319
You're shooting like me now.

16:33.592 --> 16:36.459
Yeah, we both former Ravens now, too.

16:36.528 --> 16:40.225
- What? Why?
- Oh, well, I don't know. Let's see.

16:40.399 --> 16:41.832
This thing?

16:41.900 --> 16:46.269
You're still part of the team, Q.
You can't just quit because you're injured.

16:46.338 --> 16:48.704
You sound like your brother now.

16:48.774 --> 16:50.105
I mean, I expected a little grief from you,

16:50.175 --> 16:52.439
but what's Lucas know
about playing injured, anyway?

16:52.511 --> 16:57.312
Let me tell you something about Lucas.
Lucas played injured his entire senior year.

16:57.383 --> 17:00.841
Cost him a lot of playing time,
but he never gave up on his team.

17:00.919 --> 17:03.149
- And what if they make the playoffs?
- They won't.

17:03.222 --> 17:05.315
Even if they do, man,
it's my shooting hand, Nate.

17:05.391 --> 17:06.824
I ain't gonna be ready
for the scouts anyway.

17:06.892 --> 17:08.859
Well, then, you'll have to learn
how to play differently.

17:08.926 --> 17:11.987
- You have to reinvent your game.
- Reinvent my...

17:12.064 --> 17:15.396
- Man, that ain't that easy, okay?
- Who said it was gonna be easy?

17:15.467 --> 17:16.798
But what are you gonna do?
You gonna quit?

17:16.868 --> 17:18.837
You gonna throw away everything
you ever worked for?

17:18.904 --> 17:21.737
No, I'm not going to, I already did. Okay?

17:23.142 --> 17:26.339
- You know I punched that dude for you?
- Come on.

17:26.412 --> 17:30.041
I've thrown a lot of punches,
and every last one was selfish.

17:30.115 --> 17:34.711
Now, face it, Q,
you punched that guy for you. Deal with it.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.358
<i>We'll nail him!</i>

17:41.527 --> 17:43.859
You're dead, dude. Deal with it.

17:43.929 --> 17:45.328
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

17:45.798 --> 17:48.892
Hey. These games are so addicting,

17:48.967 --> 17:51.868
I just waxed a 13-year-old kid
from Arkansas. He was pretty upset.

17:51.937 --> 17:55.737
Okay. We're gonna have
to keep an eye on that.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.639
Millie, you won't guess
what happened to me today at work.

17:57.709 --> 17:59.301
- What?
- I'm gonna get a shot

17:59.378 --> 18:01.107
to anchor the sports segments tomorrow.

18:01.180 --> 18:02.977
- No way.
- Yeah, the regular guy's sick,

18:03.048 --> 18:04.709
and the station manager's
giving me a shot.

18:04.783 --> 18:06.341
Marvin, that is great!

18:06.418 --> 18:08.943
Just think of all those people
who are gonna be watching you on TV.

18:09.021 --> 18:11.285
You wanna come?
You could be there at the station?

18:11.356 --> 18:14.018
I wish I could, but Brooke has
her big presentation tomorrow,

18:14.093 --> 18:16.288
and I promised to look after the baby.

18:16.361 --> 18:20.593
But I'll watch every minute of you
on the big screen at the store.

18:20.666 --> 18:24.295
I'm so proud of you, Marvin.
You're gonna do great.

18:32.644 --> 18:36.580
- Mama, where does Grandpa Dan live?
- Why?

18:36.648 --> 18:40.482
I need to thank him
for my birthday present. Can you take me?

18:42.588 --> 18:44.852
Well, I can't do that right now, 'cause...

18:44.923 --> 18:48.654
Well, Grandpa Dan lives at the beach,
and it's getting kind of late.

18:48.727 --> 18:50.160
But I'll tell you what we can do.

18:50.229 --> 18:52.527
<i>(MYLOVE IN</i> BLUEPLAYING)

- and I will make sure that he gets it.
- Cool.

18:57.369 --> 19:00.930

19:26.698 --> 19:29.462
What if she dies? What then?

19:29.535 --> 19:33.631
What do I tell her parents,
these people that I've never met?

19:33.705 --> 19:36.173
What made me think I could handle this?

19:36.241 --> 19:41.076
Hey. Just remember, you're giving Angie
a chance to live a full, wonderful life.

19:44.283 --> 19:47.081
She couldn't do that without the surgery.

19:48.453 --> 19:50.648
Yeah, I guess so.

<i>Oh, my love in blue</i>

- I do not.

20:20.319 --> 20:23.379
Do, too. You're killing me.

20:26.425 --> 20:28.791
It's true. Dan's dying.

20:29.695 --> 20:31.390
Without a transplant, he's got six months.

20:31.463 --> 20:34.261
- And you're sure?
- I spoke with the cardiologist.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.733
- So what are we gonna do?
- Nothing.

20:37.703 --> 20:40.103
In six months, Dan's out of our lives,
once and for all.

It couldn't happen
to a more deserving guy.

No, it's not. He has two more broadcasts
this afternoon.

more than I need you here.

So come on. If we hurry, I can drop you off
and still make it in time.

22:40.826 --> 22:42.817
Come on, baby, let's go.

22:47.632 --> 22:52.501
So, without Quentin,
we have no inside game.

- No defense.
- And no assists.

<i>(SONG WE SANG AWA</i> YPLAYING)

- Yeah? Let's hear it.

22:59.945 --> 23:02.812
I say we push the tempo
and just shoot threes.

23:02.881 --> 23:04.872
Like, almost all threes.

23:04.950 --> 23:06.508
I mean, we still got
some good outside shooters,

23:06.585 --> 23:08.212
and they're in pretty good shape,
so if we push it,

23:08.286 --> 23:10.277
we might just run the score up
high enough

23:10.355 --> 23:13.085
to where we don't need no big man
in the paint.

23:13.158 --> 23:16.958
- Almost all threes, huh?
- Hey, it wasn't my idea, it was him.

23:17.996 --> 23:20.055
That's a good idea, Jamie.

23:20.165 --> 23:21.564
Hey, but see, with that kind of offense,

23:21.633 --> 23:25.865
we're gonna need a really strong player

- Okay.

23:57.936 --> 24:00.769
Weird and totally inappropriate of me,

'Cause I know that he loves you.
And he hasn't wavered from that.

24:12.350 --> 24:14.682
Yes, he wrote about a comet,

24:14.753 --> 24:18.553
but in his non-fiction life,
he seems very much in love with you.

24:18.657 --> 24:20.955
Have you read the book, Peyton?

24:24.296 --> 24:25.558
I didn't think so.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.860
Because if you had,
you wouldn't be so sure

24:27.933 --> 24:30.026
who Lucas loves and how much.

24:30.101 --> 24:33.502
Lindsey, the book was a work of fiction,

24:33.572 --> 24:38.339
but what wasn't fiction was the fact
that he said "I do" to you in that church.

24:45.750 --> 24:49.709
It's not me that has to make
a decision about Lucas.

24:51.256 --> 24:52.655
It's you.

24:54.359 --> 24:58.352
Go home, Peyton.
Go home and read his book.

Oh, and hey, Quentin?
You're not quitting the Ravens.

25:33.431 --> 25:35.831
You quit the Ravens?

25:35.901 --> 25:38.836
- Yeah, I got hurt, little man.
- My daddy got hurt, too.

25:38.904 --> 25:40.963
Sometimes it makes him sad.

25:43.475 --> 25:47.912
I'd give anything to see him play again.
I can tell he wants to.

25:51.249 --> 25:52.648
You realize I can make one phone call

25:52.717 --> 25:54.582
and have your parole revoked
for coming around here like this?

25:54.653 --> 25:56.211
Just hear me out, Nathan.

25:56.288 --> 25:58.017
Once I've said my piece,
I'll go and never come back,

25:58.089 --> 26:01.490
- if that's what you want.
- Okay, you got five minutes.

26:05.330 --> 26:07.127
I never told anyone else this before,

26:07.198 --> 26:10.167
but when I was in prison,
I tried to kill myself.

26:10.235 --> 26:12.203
I put a rope around my neck
and I tried to hang myself.

26:12.270 --> 26:13.931
- Dad, I...
- Just let me finish.

26:14.005 --> 26:17.202
<i>Can you place yourself</i>
<i>in a moment's notice, in my situation?</i>

26:17.275 --> 26:22.303
When I stepped off that chair,
I'd truly given up on everything.

26:22.414 --> 26:25.474
But then the rope broke,
and I took it as a sign,

26:25.584 --> 26:29.179
a sign that I wasn't finished on this Earth,
that my life wasn't complete.

26:29.254 --> 26:31.688
So you see, I need to fix it.

26:31.756 --> 26:36.159
I need to fix all of it. You. Us.
I need that peace before I die.

26:39.965 --> 26:43.492

with what little time I have left.

26:44.469 --> 26:45.959

26:49.507 --> 26:51.975
Nathan. Please.

- He'll be fine.

and the teleprompters, it's...

27:23.408 --> 27:26.707
- It's different than I expected.
- Marvin, it's okay.

27:27.278 --> 27:30.839
Do you remember what you told me
when you first brought me here?

27:30.915 --> 27:32.314
I can't remember.

27:32.384 --> 27:36.912
You said that sports reminded you
of the greatness we all have inside of us.

27:36.988 --> 27:40.549
You said that on any given day,
an underdog can rise up.

27:41.660 --> 27:46.029
Well, you're my underdog, Marvin.
And you can do this.

27:46.131 --> 27:47.598

28:25.003 --> 28:27.233
there was genuine excitement
about what lies ahead.

28:31.810 --> 28:33.437
- Brooke Davis.
- Hi.

28:33.511 --> 28:36.947
So sorry I'm late, everyone.
Something sort of came up.

28:37.015 --> 28:42.954
Excuse me. Just set that down.
Set that here, sorry. We can get started.

28:43.021 --> 28:45.683
Are you sure you're prepared
for this meeting, Miss Davis?

28:45.757 --> 28:48.954
- Perhaps we should reschedule.
- Oh, no. I'm ready to go, I just...

Look, all right, I owe you an apology.
I'm sorry.

29:29.501 --> 29:32.766

that were just out of line.

29:35.106 --> 29:38.564
I was just upset about my wrist
and I didn't think you had my back.

Quentin, the day you think Lucas and I
don't have your best interests at heart,

29:42.847 --> 29:44.838
that's the day I gotta call you on it.

that we gonna do whatever it takes

- Okay.

30:12.510 --> 30:14.944
You didn't give it away, did you?

30:15.914 --> 30:18.280
We probably could get that back.

30:20.285 --> 30:24.119
Hey, Q. Apology accepted, man.

30:37.302 --> 30:41.136
Okay, we're in this together.
It's just me and you.

30:41.206 --> 30:43.367

I mean, I'm not gonna tell you to pass

- But we're just shooting threes.

40:07.671 --> 40:11.903
<i>Down a road that's leading me nowhere</i>

40:13.844 --> 40:17.405
<i>And there's no way around it</i>

40:17.481 --> 40:21.178
<i>Will this be our last dance?</i>

40:21.252 --> 40:25.689
<i>Fall asleep with the TV, darling</i>

40:26.490 --> 40:31.154
<i>Be back again</i>

40:31.228 --> 40:33.822
<i>LUKE: And his world would be whole again.</i>

40:33.898 --> 40:37.698
<i>And his belief in God, and love, and art</i>

40:39.603 --> 40:42.037
<i>would be reawakened in his heart.</i>

40:43.607 --> 40:46.041
Thank you for being so good today.

40:46.644 --> 40:49.374
We make a pretty good team, me and you.

40:51.882 --> 40:54.874
I know this surgery is really scary,

40:54.952 --> 40:59.412
but I'm gonna be right here for you,
every step of the way, okay?

40:59.490 --> 41:02.015
We're gonna get through this together.

41:02.092 --> 41:03.184
Yeah.

41:04.929 --> 41:07.489
And I know I'm not your real mom,

41:09.200 --> 41:13.830
but I could just use a sign or something
to let me know I'm doing okay.

41:26.817 --> 41:27.943
Okay.

41:30.921 --> 41:32.786
It's you and me, baby.
