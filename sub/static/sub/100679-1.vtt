WEBVTT

01:15.267 --> 01:17.837
Kick out the fires, campers,
it's time to turn it in.

01:17.870 --> 01:19.872
Let's go to bed,
come on, let's go.

01:19.906 --> 01:21.606
- Okay.
- All right.

01:21.641 --> 01:23.810
Bedtime. Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

01:23.843 --> 01:26.846
- Bret, turn off the TV.
- After this game.

01:26.879 --> 01:28.648
You gotta get
some sleep, buddy.

01:28.681 --> 01:30.348
If you pass
your driver's test tomorrow,

01:30.382 --> 01:32.517
then you can drive a real car.
Wouldn't that be somethin'?

01:32.551 --> 01:34.419
This is kinda
like practice, Dad.

01:34.453 --> 01:36.856
Oh, well, this wouldn't be
confusing or distracting.

01:36.889 --> 01:38.691
Come on, Dad.

01:38.725 --> 01:40.292
- Is this a problem for you?
- Dad.

01:40.325 --> 01:41.828
- I'm so sorry.
- You're gonna make me crash!

01:41.861 --> 01:43.696
I'm a pedestrian!
I'm a pedestrian, look out!

01:43.730 --> 01:46.498
Don't hit the pedestrians!
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

01:46.531 --> 01:48.300
Go to bed.

01:49.902 --> 01:51.570
Love you.

01:52.905 --> 01:54.941
Toby, shut the TV.

01:57.476 --> 02:00.345
All right, pal,
it's just you and me,

02:00.378 --> 02:03.482
so you know what that means.
Snack time.

02:05.084 --> 02:07.552
One for me.

02:09.588 --> 02:10.790
And one for you.

02:12.324 --> 02:15.427
Mm, I got my snack,
buddy.

02:15.460 --> 02:16.696
Here's yours.

02:18.765 --> 02:20.565
Good catch.

03:08.948 --> 03:10.950
Activate tactical vest.

03:18.891 --> 03:23.461
<i>Agent Toby Barks,
do you read me?</i>

03:23.495 --> 03:27.099
<i>Agent Toby Barks, come back.</i>

03:27.133 --> 03:29.735
Hold your horses, lady.

03:29.769 --> 03:32.537
I mean,
reporting for duty, ma'am.

03:33.538 --> 03:35.540
<i>That's more like it.</i>

03:35.574 --> 03:39.078
<i>How's that Bark Link working?
I've made some modifications.</i>

03:39.111 --> 03:43.149
Seems to be working great.
I feel like I could <i>♪ sing! ♪</i>

03:43.182 --> 03:45.084
<i>Great, hold that song
for later.</i>

03:45.117 --> 03:46.719
<i>We have business to tend to.</i>

03:46.752 --> 03:49.421
Oh, fine, I'm all ears.

03:49.454 --> 03:51.858
<i>Agent Prescott will brief you
at the mobile command unit.</i>

03:51.891 --> 03:55.560
- Roger.
- <i>Gear up, and meet at the extraction point.</i>

03:56.696 --> 03:57.930
Better get my tail movin'.

04:18.784 --> 04:22.021
It's go time. Yeah.

04:29.195 --> 04:31.063
Agent Barks,
welcome to the party.

04:33.232 --> 04:34.867
Let's go.

04:34.901 --> 04:36.002
Don't have
to tell me twice.

04:36.035 --> 04:40.640
All systems online.

04:40.673 --> 04:42.675
<i>Looks like the team's
all here.</i>

04:42.708 --> 04:45.543
<i>Agent Prescott,
let's go.</i>

04:45.577 --> 04:47.479
Meet Horrace the Horrible.

04:47.512 --> 04:50.582
He's big, he's nasty,
and he loves money.

04:50.615 --> 04:54.020
<i>He runs an evil faction out of an
old nightclub on the edge of town.</i>

04:54.053 --> 04:56.689
<i>He's hired rogue hackers
to spread a virus</i>

04:56.722 --> 04:58.925
<i>within the American
banking system.</i>

04:58.958 --> 05:01.459
<i>His ultimate plan is
to shut down Wall Street,</i>

05:01.493 --> 05:04.830
<i>creating an economic downswing
worse than the Great Depression.</i>

05:04.864 --> 05:08.734
<i>He always rolls
with a pack of very mean,</i>

05:08.768 --> 05:11.837
<i>very dedicated bodyguards.</i>

05:11.871 --> 05:15.041
<i>He is considered to be
extremely dangerous.</i>

05:15.074 --> 05:17.710
This man must be stopped.

05:17.743 --> 05:19.544
That's where Toby here
comes in.

05:19.577 --> 05:22.148
<i>The Horrible Compound is known
for its tight security.</i>

05:22.181 --> 05:24.516
Agent Barks can
infiltrate the building

05:24.549 --> 05:26.018
and shut down
the security system,

05:26.052 --> 05:28.254
allowing agents in
through the undefended flanks

05:28.287 --> 05:30.488
east and west
of the main building.

05:30.522 --> 05:34.492
- You be careful in there, Agent Barks.
- Copy that.

05:34.526 --> 05:35.828
Have no fear, buddy.

05:35.861 --> 05:37.797
We're watching
your every move.

05:37.830 --> 05:39.966
I got this,
no problem, Jack.

05:59.952 --> 06:02.121
Toby, you've got
company.

06:04.290 --> 06:06.959
Copy that.
I can smell 'em.

06:17.169 --> 06:19.537
Activate stink canister.

06:27.880 --> 06:29.614
It stinks!

06:30.615 --> 06:32.118
Threat neutralized.

06:32.151 --> 06:35.788
Stinky job,
but somebody's gotta do it.

06:35.821 --> 06:39.792
West wall is clear, repeat,
all clear on the west wall.

06:39.825 --> 06:41.894
Nice work.
Move in.

06:41.927 --> 06:45.031
Ray Ray,
remember that vault job in Rhode Island?

06:45.064 --> 06:48.634
That's peanuts to this!

06:48.667 --> 06:50.602
- We're gettin' paid, boys.
- Yeah!

06:51.603 --> 06:52.838
Third door on the left.

06:52.872 --> 06:55.007
That's the security hub,
but be careful.

06:55.041 --> 06:56.742
You need to get
by the main "foryer."

06:56.776 --> 06:58.610
<i>It's foyer.</i>

06:58.644 --> 07:00.880
That place is crawlin'
with guards.

07:00.913 --> 07:03.783
- Double D.
- A crawling joke?

07:03.816 --> 07:06.252
This is the big job!

07:07.920 --> 07:13.159
Soon, we will destroy
Wall Street.

07:13.192 --> 07:14.960
Whoo, let's go!

07:14.994 --> 07:17.830
The markets will crash!

07:19.765 --> 07:21.267
<i>Yeah!</i>

07:23.135 --> 07:24.737
<i>That's it, Toby,
that's the main hub.</i>

07:24.770 --> 07:26.839
You're doing fantastic.

07:26.872 --> 07:29.842
Now plant that virus,
and let's go home.

07:29.875 --> 07:33.012
The country
will crumble!

07:35.981 --> 07:38.150
It's time that we take over!

07:38.184 --> 07:40.786
Yeah!

07:52.431 --> 07:55.768
Okay, let's see here.

07:57.403 --> 07:59.738
- Come on, come on
- <i>Toby, look out.</i>

07:59.772 --> 08:02.875
Two bogies headin'
your way and fast.

08:02.908 --> 08:04.677
Repeat, two bogies!

08:04.710 --> 08:07.046
Yeah!

08:18.958 --> 08:22.027
Come on, come on, come on.

08:37.776 --> 08:39.912
Aw!

08:39.945 --> 08:43.415
- Look at this little guy!
- Oh, somebody wants a belly rub!

08:43.449 --> 08:45.784
This must be
Horrace's new dog.

08:45.818 --> 08:48.721
- Hey, he kinda looks like him.
- Yeah, he does.

08:48.754 --> 08:51.390
- Don't tell him I said that.
- Mm, no, I won't.

08:51.423 --> 08:54.126
Oh, boy, yeah.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.195
Better get goin'.

08:57.396 --> 08:58.764
Fools.

08:58.797 --> 09:00.733
<i>Works every time.</i>

09:06.138 --> 09:08.073
Those typing classes
came in handy.

09:31.864 --> 09:34.300
What is this?

09:34.333 --> 09:35.801
I don't know.

09:38.837 --> 09:40.940
No. It's not responding!

09:40.973 --> 09:42.508
It's not.

09:42.541 --> 09:44.343
Sound the alarms!

09:44.376 --> 09:46.345
They're coming for us.

09:46.378 --> 09:50.249
Here's a little goin' away
present, fellas.

09:58.324 --> 10:01.327
He did it.
All their systems are down.

10:01.360 --> 10:03.095
Yes!

10:04.863 --> 10:09.134
Get Agent Barks out of there,
and send in the cavalry.

10:11.237 --> 10:14.506
Toby, the back window to the
rear courtyard is open and clear.

10:23.382 --> 10:26.318
No!

10:38.931 --> 10:40.099
All right.

10:43.602 --> 10:45.170
Woo-hoo!

10:49.141 --> 10:50.809
All right!

11:06.258 --> 11:08.093
Mission accomplished, baby!

11:15.868 --> 11:19.238
Yeah. Proud to know you,
Agent Barks.

11:19.271 --> 11:21.840
Couldn't have done it
without you.

11:24.076 --> 11:27.413
You gotta love it.
One more bad guy off the Most Wanted list,

11:27.446 --> 11:30.482
one more dangerous raid with
nobody hurt on either side.

11:30.516 --> 11:32.951
He's a fine agent, sir.

11:35.154 --> 11:36.855
Figured nothin'
like a smoke show

11:36.889 --> 11:38.524
to add a little excitement
to the dance floor.

11:39.659 --> 11:41.026
Hey, Toby.

11:42.928 --> 11:45.164
I figured
I'd throw you a bone.

11:45.197 --> 11:46.565
This guy gets it.

11:46.598 --> 11:48.100
Hawk, you're the man.

11:48.133 --> 11:50.469
Thank you, but I gotta take
that bone to go.

11:50.502 --> 11:53.539
Need to get back before my people
wake up and notice I'm gone.

11:55.174 --> 11:57.509
Of course. Later, Toby.

11:59.178 --> 12:03.182
Agents, we were all just
in the presence of greatness.

12:05.652 --> 12:07.319
We could all learn
a lot from that dog.

12:11.290 --> 12:13.559
That dog is one of a kind.

12:13.592 --> 12:15.594
Wouldn't the world
be a happier place

12:15.628 --> 12:18.897
if there were a million others
just like him?

12:58.537 --> 13:00.339
Uh, yes, sir,
Mr. Albright.

13:00.372 --> 13:02.174
Yes, sir, I'll have
that report in

13:02.207 --> 13:04.176
by the end of the day
today, sir.

13:04.209 --> 13:05.544
Yes, sir, no problem.

13:05.577 --> 13:08.247
Uh, no.

13:08.280 --> 13:11.250
No, no, fishing trip? No, sir,
I haven't heard anything about that yet.

13:11.283 --> 13:13.452
This is the first thing
I've heard.

13:13.485 --> 13:16.021
No... yes, sir,
yes, of course, yeah.

13:16.054 --> 13:18.123
Absolutely,
I can make that happen.

13:18.157 --> 13:19.992
Yes, sir. Okay,
I'll see you at the office then, sir.

13:20.025 --> 13:22.428
Thank you so much.
Great.

13:22.461 --> 13:25.397
Oh, boy. How am I
gonna make this happen?

13:27.132 --> 13:28.735
Kids, let's go, come on!
Let's move, move, move!

13:28.768 --> 13:31.303
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
We're gonna be late.

13:31.336 --> 13:32.705
- Morning, Daddy.
- Good morning, sweetheart.

13:32.739 --> 13:36.041
Wow, look at... That is
a very, very festive outfit.

13:36.074 --> 13:37.376
Thanks, I like
all the colors.

13:37.409 --> 13:40.245
- What's for breakfast?
- Breakfast, um...

13:40.279 --> 13:42.649
<i>♪ Doughnuts! ♪</i>
I got doughnuts.

13:42.682 --> 13:44.684
- Doughnuts are for breakfast.
- Doughnuts are for breakfast, sweetheart!

13:44.717 --> 13:46.485
- Oh, wow, doughnuts?
- Look at that!

13:48.287 --> 13:51.089
- Ah, sick!
- I know, right?

13:51.123 --> 13:52.458
Oh, hey, I hear
today's a big day.

13:52.491 --> 13:54.661
Yep, my boy's gonna ace
his driver's test.

13:54.694 --> 13:57.396
Yeah, can't wait.
Just me, the open road,

13:57.429 --> 13:59.598
Dad's beat up old Honda with
the busted air conditioner.

13:59.632 --> 14:01.099
- Gonna be great.
- That's a great car.

14:01.133 --> 14:02.735
You should be
very lucky to have that car.

14:02.769 --> 14:04.671
- You're welcome.
- Kate, the bus is here.

14:04.704 --> 14:06.673
Coming, Bretty.
Bye, Dad, bye, Dave.

14:06.706 --> 14:09.341
Bye, sweetheart,
I love you... okay.

14:09.374 --> 14:10.743
Hey, thank you
for comin' through

14:10.777 --> 14:14.079
with those doughnuts.
Big win.

14:14.112 --> 14:18.751
Yeah, I mean, I know it hasn't
been easy without Diane.

14:18.785 --> 14:23.121
Can you believe
it's been a year already?

14:23.155 --> 14:25.758
It's not getting easier,
you're right.

14:25.792 --> 14:28.393
Well, if we get
this promotion,

14:28.427 --> 14:30.362
you'll have less work,
more money,

14:30.395 --> 14:32.331
more time to spend
with the kids.

14:32.364 --> 14:35.267
- That's a good point.
- And then I get to have your job.

14:35.300 --> 14:37.135
Uh, yeah, no,
I don't think so.

14:37.169 --> 14:39.505
You're jumpin' the gun there
a little bit, big guy.

14:39.538 --> 14:41.774
Well, rumor has it

14:41.808 --> 14:44.644
that Albright is ready
to promote the both of us.

14:44.677 --> 14:46.512
We just need to seal the
deal on this fishing trip.

14:46.545 --> 14:48.347
- Oh, the fishing trip.
- It's great, right?

14:48.380 --> 14:51.583
No, it's terrible.
It's a scheduling nightmare for me.

14:51.617 --> 14:53.552
I gotta find someone
to watch the kids.

14:53.585 --> 14:56.622
Ted, you're doing this
for those kids.

14:56.656 --> 14:59.324
It's for their future.
You're fishing for their future.

14:59.358 --> 15:03.730
I guess
I could call my sister.

15:03.763 --> 15:06.231
Oh! Oh,
of course, yes, yes!

15:06.265 --> 15:08.333
Whatever you need,
I'm there!

15:08.367 --> 15:10.670
Okay, okay. I-I'll...

15:10.703 --> 15:14.373
I'll get my stuff,
and I will stop by after work.

15:14.406 --> 15:17.509
This is such a great surprise.
I can't wait to see everyone!

15:20.647 --> 15:21.848
- Hello.
- Oh.

15:21.881 --> 15:24.516
- Hungry?
- Oh, no, thank you.

15:24.550 --> 15:26.753
Oh, come on! Look,
it's juicy, take a bite.

15:26.786 --> 15:29.321
I don't doubt that they are,
but I really don't... okay.

15:29.354 --> 15:31.390
So, what are you
workin' on, huh?

15:31.423 --> 15:34.560
Oh, well, I was just making some
modifications to the B Link.

15:34.593 --> 15:37.229
Oh, you mean the world's
greatest invention?

15:37.262 --> 15:39.866
- You're a genius.
- Thanks.

15:39.899 --> 15:41.466
Yeah.

15:44.436 --> 15:47.239
So, that's so top secret,
I've always wondered,

15:47.272 --> 15:50.175
how do we deal with the plans
for that sort of thing?

15:50.208 --> 15:51.778
Where-where do we keep
those plans?

15:51.811 --> 15:55.147
Well, they're filed away.
Why do you wanna know?

15:55.180 --> 15:59.384
Shop talk. Inside baseball.
Chit-chat.

15:59.418 --> 16:03.589
You don't have clearance, so there's
really no point in my telling you.

16:03.622 --> 16:04.857
I could get clearance.

16:06.158 --> 16:08.293
Brr, got cold in here.

16:08.327 --> 16:10.763
Oh, nice talk.

17:09.588 --> 17:14.559
All the key ingredients for
an epic weekend with Auntie B.

17:22.735 --> 17:26.405
Well, I didn't think I'd be
seeing you again so soon, huh?

17:27.807 --> 17:30.977
Really nice of you
to help out.

17:31.010 --> 17:34.212
Well, it's a great opportunity for me
to catch up with the niece and nephew

17:34.246 --> 17:36.783
before I blink
and they're off to college.

17:36.816 --> 17:40.419
But there is one thing
I wanna make very clear.

17:41.586 --> 17:45.223
The kids cannot know
about what we do.

17:45.257 --> 17:46.558
If they were
to ever find out,

17:46.591 --> 17:48.695
we'd be putting them
in incredible danger.

17:48.728 --> 17:51.530
- Agreed.
- Okay, good.

17:52.899 --> 17:54.232
Now, do you mind?

17:54.266 --> 17:56.703
I have to go
to the bathroom.

17:56.736 --> 17:58.336
Stay!

18:13.686 --> 18:15.353
How was
your driver's test?

18:15.387 --> 18:17.890
Um, it was great.
I aced it, yeah.

18:17.924 --> 18:20.960
- Can we go for a ride?
- Um, maybe tomorrow.

18:20.993 --> 18:22.662
Yes!

18:30.737 --> 18:33.371
- Hi, Auntie B!
- I have missed you so much!

18:33.405 --> 18:36.909
- Auntie B!
- Oh!

18:36.943 --> 18:40.713
Oh, Bret, you are now taller than me!
How did that happen?

18:40.747 --> 18:42.447
Vegetables?

18:42.481 --> 18:43.783
Missed you too,
Auntie B.

18:43.816 --> 18:46.018
Yeah, we did. Hey,
today's not a holiday.

18:46.052 --> 18:48.020
No, I don't think so.
What do you mean?

18:48.054 --> 18:49.889
Well, usually you
only come on holidays.

18:49.922 --> 18:53.325
- Oh.
- Dad's home.

18:53.358 --> 18:55.293
- Ha!
- Dad, Auntie B's here!

18:55.327 --> 18:56.763
Ah, yeah, I know.
Hey, you!

18:56.796 --> 18:59.065
- Hi!
- Hi, sweetheart, my little sis.

18:59.098 --> 19:00.666
Good to see you, sis.
She's here

19:00.700 --> 19:03.002
because she's gonna
stay the weekend.

19:03.035 --> 19:05.972
Daddy has to go schmooze
his boss on a fishing trip.

19:06.005 --> 19:07.907
Daddy, what does
schmooze mean?

19:07.940 --> 19:11.978
It's like being extra nice
to somebody

19:12.011 --> 19:14.046
so they'll be nice to you
in the long run.

19:14.080 --> 19:16.783
Oh, so kinda like kissing up to
your teacher but for grownups?

19:16.816 --> 19:21.520
Yes, that's exactly what it's
like, Miss Smartypants. Geez.

19:21.553 --> 19:23.856
Hey. How'd the test go?

19:23.890 --> 19:26.926
Um, it was good,
I nailed it.

19:26.959 --> 19:30.963
I have a ton of homework and a book report.
I am so far behind.

19:30.997 --> 19:34.634
You know, actually,
I should get on it right now.

19:36.803 --> 19:38.503
Well, that's a first.

19:38.537 --> 19:39.806
Anybody hungry?

19:39.839 --> 19:41.473
Come here you.
You I gotta feed,

19:41.506 --> 19:42.675
I know I have to feed you.

19:48.480 --> 19:52.450
I guess this is the closest I'm
gonna get to a car this summer.

19:52.484 --> 19:54.519
I could've swore
I passed it.

19:55.688 --> 19:57.757
Come in.

20:01.861 --> 20:03.395
I'm not mad.

20:04.797 --> 20:05.865
But I was doing
the laundry

20:05.898 --> 20:09.534
and I found this.

20:12.905 --> 20:15.975
Well, now you know.

20:16.008 --> 20:17.844
Why'd you lie?

20:17.877 --> 20:19.679
I didn't wanna
let you down.

20:21.681 --> 20:24.917
Buddy...

20:24.951 --> 20:29.655
Making a mistake
is not letting me down.

20:29.689 --> 20:32.892
Lying to me is.

20:32.925 --> 20:35.094
All right?

20:35.127 --> 20:38.496
Lying is like driving
a car in reverse.

20:38.530 --> 20:40.066
Okay? I don't care
how good you are at it,

20:40.099 --> 20:42.101
you're still going
backwards.

20:42.134 --> 20:44.770
I was just embarrassed.

20:44.804 --> 20:46.571
Why? So what?

20:46.605 --> 20:48.140
I failed
my first driving test.

20:48.174 --> 20:50.643
- Really?
- Miserably.

20:50.676 --> 20:52.912
Like, not even close.

20:52.945 --> 20:55.580
What do I tell
the other kids?

20:55.614 --> 20:58.450
Forget them.
Your real friends won't care.

21:00.720 --> 21:03.155
I guess bad driving
runs in the family.

21:03.189 --> 21:07.459
Yeah, we don't have to
tell anybody else though, okay?

21:07.492 --> 21:08.961
That's our secret.

21:10.462 --> 21:12.430
- You okay?
- Yeah.

21:13.666 --> 21:15.167
All right.

21:15.201 --> 21:17.904
If you fail the next one,
I'm gonna kill you.

21:31.217 --> 21:33.119
Gummy worms before bed?

21:33.152 --> 21:36.722
I like your style, kid,
but I'm not so sure I can allow that.

21:36.756 --> 21:38.523
They're not for me,
they're for you, silly.

21:38.556 --> 21:40.059
Really?

21:40.092 --> 21:42.728
Yes, you can use them
as bait on your fishing trip.

21:42.762 --> 21:45.197
Oh, sweetheart,
I appreciate that,

21:45.231 --> 21:47.565
but I don't think the fishies
like candy as much as we do.

21:47.599 --> 21:49.534
No, look, they do.

21:49.567 --> 21:52.604
Fish are known to be attracted to
the bright colors of the gummy worms.

21:52.638 --> 21:55.573
- Look at that!
- Yeah, and it even says

21:55.607 --> 21:57.209
if you keep your line
just above the water,

21:57.243 --> 21:58.878
it can catch the light.

21:58.911 --> 22:00.545
I guess it makes them
all shiny.

22:00.578 --> 22:02.715
Well, you are
my little Einstein.

22:02.748 --> 22:05.583
Thank you very much.

22:05.617 --> 22:09.521
Hey, you better hit the road if you're
gonna get to the lake by daybreak.

22:09.554 --> 22:11.123
All right, all right.

22:11.157 --> 22:13.859
Listen, you have fun
with your Auntie B, okay?

22:13.893 --> 22:16.963
- Sweet dreams and jellybeans.
- And gummy worms.

22:16.996 --> 22:18.998
And gummy worms.

22:19.031 --> 22:21.566
Toby...
here, buddy.

22:21.599 --> 22:23.601
I got a little something
for you.

22:23.636 --> 22:26.739
Listen, I know my sister's
here this weekend,

22:26.772 --> 22:30.209
but you and I know
who's really in charge, okay?

22:30.242 --> 22:32.878
It's you.
Thanks, buddy.

22:34.981 --> 22:38.918
- He understands every word I say.
- Yeah, go have some fun.

22:38.951 --> 22:42.989
I have everything
under control here.

23:08.047 --> 23:10.649
Don't even think
about it, Toby.

23:10.683 --> 23:11.817
- What smells so good?
- Oh!

23:11.851 --> 23:15.087
- Whoa!
- Order up!

23:15.121 --> 23:18.224
I wish we could have
breakfast like this every day.

23:28.334 --> 23:31.070
There's the genius!
Workin' on your day off?

23:32.705 --> 23:36.275
Oh, Agent Lane!
Everything okay?

23:36.308 --> 23:38.110
Oh, great, great, great,
couldn't be better.

23:38.144 --> 23:41.881
Brought you some coffee.
Cream, no sugar.

23:41.914 --> 23:44.683
- Just the way you like it.
- Oh, thanks.

23:44.717 --> 23:47.319
Um...

23:47.353 --> 23:49.855
So how'd you know
to track me down here?

23:49.889 --> 23:51.957
I'm a federal agent,
it's what we do.

23:51.991 --> 23:54.794
I guess...
guess that's true.

23:54.827 --> 23:59.765
Actually, I wanted a little time
just me and you away from the office.

23:59.799 --> 24:01.934
Oh.

24:01.967 --> 24:04.170
- Go on...
- It's about the B Link.

24:04.203 --> 24:08.808
The ability to translate
barking into words.

24:08.841 --> 24:10.209
I mean, who knew
that "woof woof"

24:10.242 --> 24:12.078
meant, "How you doin',
Charlie?"

24:12.111 --> 24:15.948
Ha. You made it possible
for man's best friend

24:15.981 --> 24:18.684
to actually be
man's best friend.

24:18.717 --> 24:21.353
Well, the frequencies
were always there.

24:21.387 --> 24:23.989
- It was just a matter of deciphering...
- No, you!

24:24.023 --> 24:26.392
You made them talk.

24:26.425 --> 24:29.195
I didn't make them
talk, Agent Lane.

24:29.228 --> 24:32.298
Dogs have been talking
since the beginning of time.

24:32.331 --> 24:34.767
I just found a way
for us to listen to them.

24:34.800 --> 24:37.069
- Well, listen to this...
- What's this about?

24:37.103 --> 24:43.342
What if I told you that I could put
$20 million in your pocket today

24:43.375 --> 24:48.714
and offer you a partnership in my
new enterprise, Lane Technologies?

24:48.747 --> 24:53.853
Which will be worth billions for
all of us very soon, I assure you.

24:53.886 --> 24:55.888
All you would have to do...

24:55.921 --> 24:59.258
Leave out the plans
for the B Link,

24:59.291 --> 25:01.927
accidentally, casually,

25:01.961 --> 25:05.197
so I could take a few quick
snaps of them, huh?

25:05.231 --> 25:08.100
- Okay, okay.
- Uh-huh, yeah?

25:08.134 --> 25:10.035
That's a good joke.

25:10.069 --> 25:13.139
No, no, no, this is
anything but a joke.

25:13.172 --> 25:19.278
I have an associate at the
largest overseas tech company

25:19.311 --> 25:22.715
who is willing to pay
a fortune for those plans.

25:22.748 --> 25:24.950
You really aren't
joking, are you?

25:24.984 --> 25:28.254
You don't realize
what you have here!

25:28.287 --> 25:31.357
You have invented
the most important device

25:31.390 --> 25:35.427
of the history of mankind
and animalkind.

25:35.461 --> 25:38.464
I mean, every little boy
is gonna wanna come home

25:38.497 --> 25:40.766
and hear about the dog's day.

25:40.799 --> 25:43.235
Every little girl
will be able to say,

25:43.269 --> 25:44.803
"Fluffy, how you feeling?"

25:44.837 --> 25:46.172
"I ate a paperclip."

25:46.205 --> 25:50.176
Or you could be on vacation
and call home,

25:50.209 --> 25:53.012
and Bowser can say,
"I chased a burglar away."

25:53.045 --> 25:57.216
The possibilities are endless
for this invention

25:57.249 --> 26:01.020
and the marketing, the social
media, the interactive games...

26:01.053 --> 26:03.455
We've got a goldmine!

26:03.489 --> 26:07.393
But I didn't invent
the B Link to cash in.

26:07.426 --> 26:09.395
I invented it to help people.

26:09.428 --> 26:12.064
Well, it could still
help people,

26:12.097 --> 26:14.967
only in a different way.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.269
- Not a chance.
- Well, I don't think you understand...

26:17.303 --> 26:20.005
You know, why don't we pretend
that this is all a big joke

26:20.039 --> 26:22.241
and act like it never
happened, hm?

26:22.274 --> 26:24.243
Otherwise, I'm gonna
report you so fast

26:24.276 --> 26:26.879
that your tie will spin
right off your shirt collar.

26:26.912 --> 26:29.982
Ouch. So that's the way
you wanna play it?

26:30.015 --> 26:32.351
Oh, that's exactly
how I wanna play it.

26:32.384 --> 26:35.854
Okay, so it's all a big joke.

26:38.524 --> 26:41.827
Yeah, you owe me $5
for the coffee.

26:41.860 --> 26:44.930
Joking!

26:44.964 --> 26:47.166
Big joke.

26:47.199 --> 26:49.969
Enjoy your day, partner.

27:05.918 --> 27:09.021
All righty, we score big
with the boss this weekend,

27:09.054 --> 27:11.023
we earn ourselves
the Empress account

27:11.056 --> 27:14.059
along with a couple
of promotions.

27:14.093 --> 27:16.161
Yeah, well,
you're in luck, buddy,

27:16.195 --> 27:18.430
'cause I can fish
like a grizzly bear.

27:18.464 --> 27:21.200
I'll believe
it when I see it.

27:21.233 --> 27:23.102
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, here he comes.

27:23.135 --> 27:27.006
Shall we do battle
with Neptune, boys, hm?

27:27.039 --> 27:31.510
Test our mettle against
man's oldest adversary?

27:31.543 --> 27:33.946
- Huh?
- I think he wants to know

27:33.979 --> 27:37.149
- if we're ready to fish.
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.

27:37.182 --> 27:39.251
- Bait me up, Teddy.
- Yes, sir.

27:39.285 --> 27:41.920
I'm glad you boys
could make it.

27:41.954 --> 27:46.258
You know there's a
legendary fish in this lake?

27:46.292 --> 27:48.861
And I'm gonna catch it.

27:48.894 --> 27:51.330
The bad guys are
getting smarter every day,

27:51.363 --> 27:53.232
so we've gotta keep
one step ahead of them.

27:53.265 --> 27:55.134
- Are you ready?
- Born ready, baby.

27:55.167 --> 27:58.971
Okay. This looks like
a regular tennis ball, right?

27:59.004 --> 28:00.105
Right.

28:00.139 --> 28:02.207
All right,
take a good chew.

28:06.378 --> 28:11.016
Yeah, one good bite and it's
lights out for 30 seconds.

28:11.050 --> 28:14.486
It cuts the power and stops
any signal of any kind.

28:14.520 --> 28:16.221
Snap into that bad boy,

28:16.255 --> 28:18.357
and everything
within a 100-foot radius

28:18.390 --> 28:20.259
goes back to the Stone Age.

28:20.292 --> 28:22.061
Wow, that would come in handy

28:22.094 --> 28:24.596
when it's time to make
a quick getaway.

28:24.631 --> 28:26.598
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- I'll take it.

28:26.633 --> 28:28.200
Hey, what's in here?

28:28.233 --> 28:29.601
Oh, oh, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

28:29.636 --> 28:33.005
Um, this? This is
the Crossbone,

28:33.038 --> 28:35.040
and it is, perhaps,
my finest invention,

28:35.074 --> 28:40.012
but it is not ready yet,
so paws off, please.

28:40.045 --> 28:42.314
- All right, all right.
- Oh, yes, yes, yes.

28:48.354 --> 28:52.358
I give you
the cam collar.

28:53.626 --> 28:55.227
- Hey, you're on TV.
- Mm-hmm.

28:55.260 --> 28:58.931
We see everything you see.

28:58.964 --> 29:00.432
Wow.

29:00.466 --> 29:03.068
It's incredible,
you really outdid yourself.

29:03.102 --> 29:05.971
Oh, you know.

29:15.514 --> 29:18.150
Eh? Look at that.

29:18.183 --> 29:20.352
That was a nice cast.

29:37.236 --> 29:38.604
Oh, hi!

29:38.638 --> 29:41.206
There's my favorite kids
in the galaxy.

29:41.240 --> 29:43.542
Whoa...

29:43.575 --> 29:46.412
- Auntie B, are you okay?
- I'll call for help.

29:46.445 --> 29:49.548
No, no, no, no, I'm fine.
Just a little slip.

29:49.581 --> 29:51.316
Good, you scared me.

29:51.350 --> 29:53.720
Yeah, that was
a pretty hard fall.

29:53.753 --> 29:55.120
That was nothin'.

29:55.154 --> 29:56.355
Whatcha workin' on there?

29:56.388 --> 29:58.557
I am glad
that you asked.

29:58.590 --> 30:01.728
I know that your dad needs a
little help around the house,

30:01.761 --> 30:05.732
and after you enjoyed breakfast so
much, I said to myself,

30:05.765 --> 30:09.535
"How can I ensure that my
favorite kids in the galaxy

30:09.568 --> 30:13.572
have the most important meal
of the day every day?"

30:13.605 --> 30:18.243
And so I whipped up...

30:18.277 --> 30:21.280
- the Diner Drone!
- <i>♪ Diner Drone ♪</i>

30:21.313 --> 30:23.215
The Diner Drone.
I like the name.

30:23.248 --> 30:26.518
It is easy to use,
so check it out.

30:26.552 --> 30:28.487
You see our funnels
here, yes?

30:28.520 --> 30:32.191
So you just put in
basic breakfast ingredients,

30:32.224 --> 30:33.726
like syrup...

30:40.399 --> 30:43.469
Or flour...

30:45.404 --> 30:48.240
your sugar,
and I know you like that.

30:50.576 --> 30:54.747
And just a little bit
of bacon, just a little.

30:58.116 --> 30:59.752
- Can I try one?
- Crack away.

31:03.255 --> 31:05.792
All right, now we get
to customize our settings.

31:05.825 --> 31:07.627
So scrambled. Scrambled, right?
All right.

31:09.361 --> 31:13.499
Okay, and you might want
to step aside a little bit.

31:13.532 --> 31:15.501
I've never really tested
this thing out.

31:15.534 --> 31:19.304
And if it smokes,
that's normal, so...

31:19.338 --> 31:22.675
Now basically, your standard
ordinary breakfast

31:22.709 --> 31:26.445
takes approximately nine minutes
to create from start to finish,

31:26.478 --> 31:32.384
but the Diner Drone accomplishes
the whole thing in 18 seconds.

31:32.417 --> 31:35.788
Don't ask me how I do it,
it's top secret.

31:35.822 --> 31:37.456
Oh!

31:48.835 --> 31:51.704
And just because it's a shame
to waste food,

31:51.738 --> 31:54.573
- this is an after-school snack.
- Thanks!

31:54.606 --> 31:57.409
Can you believe we get to eat
breakfast like this every day?

31:57.442 --> 31:59.511
How did you do this
in just a few hours?

31:59.545 --> 32:02.080
That's also top secret.

32:04.216 --> 32:07.252
What's the matter
with these fish?

32:07.286 --> 32:11.724
I got good bait.
Are they too good for my bait?

32:11.758 --> 32:14.293
They're just
not bitin', sir.

32:15.561 --> 32:19.766
Thanks, master
of the obvious.

32:19.799 --> 32:25.370
You know, I brought you two out
here to see if you were lucky.

32:25.404 --> 32:27.139
Lucky, sir?

32:28.473 --> 32:30.509
I always say it's better
to be lucky than good.

32:30.542 --> 32:34.246
In business, it takes a lot
of luck to become successful,

32:34.279 --> 32:36.248
and there's no better judge
of a man's luck

32:36.281 --> 32:39.217
than by how the fish bite.

32:39.251 --> 32:41.086
I see.

32:42.387 --> 32:44.222
Well, then, I say
we change our luck, sir.

32:44.256 --> 32:46.525
- I don't follow.
- Well, we've been fishing

32:46.558 --> 32:50.863
this exact same spot all day
without so much as a nibble.

32:50.897 --> 32:53.733
I say we go fish
that little point right there

32:53.766 --> 32:55.200
underneath those trees?

32:55.233 --> 32:57.670
I'll bet you
that big, glorious fish

32:57.704 --> 32:59.806
is just sittin' under there
in the shade

32:59.839 --> 33:02.140
waiting for us to come over
there tomorrow,

33:02.174 --> 33:04.576
catch him, and put him
inside your cooler.

33:04.610 --> 33:06.913
I like your moxie,
Theodore.

33:06.946 --> 33:08.513
All right.

33:08.547 --> 33:12.852
Tomorrow morning,
we hit that spot at dawn.

33:12.885 --> 33:15.788
Now let's make camp
before it gets too dark.

33:15.822 --> 33:17.289
Yes, sir.

33:22.527 --> 33:26.298
Auntie B, why are we at an
old, empty grocery store?

33:26.331 --> 33:30.235
Well, it's not the old,
empty grocery store I'm after.

33:30.268 --> 33:32.170
It is the old,
empty parking lot.

33:32.204 --> 33:34.841
- Hop out of the car, Bret.
- Huh?

33:34.874 --> 33:38.210
Hop out of the car,
switch places with me, mm?

33:52.324 --> 33:54.426
What is she doing?

34:05.337 --> 34:10.810
You are about to enroll
in the Auntie B Driving Academy.

34:18.517 --> 34:19.719
Whew!

34:23.622 --> 34:25.490
So... ahem.

34:25.524 --> 34:29.361
The key to operating
a motor vehicle

34:29.394 --> 34:31.731
is simple
but very crucial.

34:31.764 --> 34:34.499
It's all about sight lines,
my young friend.

34:34.533 --> 34:38.403
You are aware of everything in
your environment at all times,

34:38.437 --> 34:41.239
including the ignition.
Start the car.

34:41.273 --> 34:44.543
Yeah!

34:44.576 --> 34:46.211
Yeah...

35:14.874 --> 35:18.376
- Lane?
- Hi.

35:18.410 --> 35:20.579
What are you doing here?

35:20.612 --> 35:22.347
Oh, nothing of any
interest whatsoever.

35:22.380 --> 35:24.751
I... you know,
I was just tryin' to catch up,

35:24.784 --> 35:26.819
and, you know,
get ahead of the game.

35:26.853 --> 35:29.756
Heh. You know, success
favors the diligent.

35:29.789 --> 35:31.456
That's what I say.

35:31.490 --> 35:33.860
Yeah? Oh, well,
we're both very wise.

35:33.893 --> 35:35.661
So what are you
doing here?

35:35.695 --> 35:37.596
- Same, just... work.
- Oh, well.

35:37.630 --> 35:38.998
- Good for you.
- Work to do.

35:39.031 --> 35:41.600
Good for you. A busy agent
is a great agent.

35:41.634 --> 35:44.503
So, let's get back
to it, shall we?

35:44.536 --> 35:46.404
- All right.
- All right.

35:46.438 --> 35:48.641
- Later. All right.
- Yes, much later.

35:48.674 --> 35:51.510
- Good night, Agent Prescott.
- Good night, Lane.

35:51.543 --> 35:52.745
Yes, good night.

35:55.614 --> 35:58.050
Where was I?

36:00.619 --> 36:02.889
Baddies, bullies,
charming sociopaths,

36:02.922 --> 36:04.489
cheaters, crackpots, creeps,

36:04.523 --> 36:06.726
crooks, deranged psychopaths...

36:06.759 --> 36:10.495
Ah-ha! Dangerous maniacs...

36:11.496 --> 36:13.598
and there he is.

36:13.633 --> 36:17.103
Sunny Wolf.

36:17.136 --> 36:20.840
Takes a big bad wolf to catch
a chatty little dog.

36:35.121 --> 36:38.390
100! 101! 102!

36:38.423 --> 36:43.963
Keep going!
You got this, yeah!

36:48.935 --> 36:53.139
It's for you.

36:53.172 --> 36:54.807
Wolf here.

36:54.841 --> 36:57.977
Hello there, Mr. Wolf.

36:58.010 --> 37:03.149
This is Benedict N. Lane
from Lane Technologies,

37:03.182 --> 37:06.585
<i>and I have a rather
lucrative offer for you, sir,</i>

37:06.618 --> 37:11.657
<i>for a man of your specific
skill set and expertise.</i>

37:11.691 --> 37:13.759
I'm listening.

37:14.760 --> 37:16.528
Oh, you're interested.

37:21.767 --> 37:23.903
What,
you're throwing sharks at me?

37:23.936 --> 37:26.906
- That makes no sense. Makes no sense.
- Come on, come on.

37:26.939 --> 37:30.142
- Move it or lose it, lady.
- Oh, ho, ho! Oh, yeah!

37:30.176 --> 37:31.844
Who taught you
how to drive, huh?

37:31.878 --> 37:33.179
Just my awesomely
wacky aunt.

37:37.149 --> 37:38.651
Whoa! Hmm!

37:38.684 --> 37:40.686
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Come on.

37:41.754 --> 37:44.556
- Oh.
- Yes!

37:44.589 --> 37:47.026
Hey, come on!

37:47.059 --> 37:50.196
Well, your awesomely
wacky aunt

37:50.229 --> 37:53.165
is quickly becoming
your awesomely old aunt.

37:53.199 --> 37:56.002
I'm ready for bed.

37:56.035 --> 38:01.439
Oh, wow, look at this!
Check out the masterpiece.

38:01.473 --> 38:03.676
That is really something.

38:03.709 --> 38:06.145
I'm getting sleepy too,
Auntie B.

38:06.178 --> 38:08.648
Why don't we call it a night,
and you go get ready,

38:08.681 --> 38:10.615
- and I'll tuck you in?
- Okay.

38:11.884 --> 38:13.920
- I'm gonna head up, too.
- Hmm.

38:13.953 --> 38:15.688
Thanks again
for the driving lesson.

38:15.721 --> 38:17.957
You'll be on the road
in no time.

38:17.990 --> 38:19.825
We'll try to get another
lesson in tomorrow.

38:19.859 --> 38:21.761
Awesome.
Night, Auntie B.

38:21.794 --> 38:23.461
Goodnight, Toby.

39:24.056 --> 39:25.590
Come on.

39:31.998 --> 39:33.666
Ah-ha.

39:45.011 --> 39:47.680
I'll grab the pooch,
you get the old lady.

39:47.713 --> 39:49.081
Got it.

40:13.339 --> 40:18.210
Get off, you stupid mangy dog!

40:28.854 --> 40:31.924
- Bretty, I heard a noise.
- So did I.

40:31.957 --> 40:33.959
Maybe Auntie B's
just getting a snack.

40:35.227 --> 40:38.297
That doesn't sound
like a snack.

40:51.377 --> 40:54.146
You stupid!

40:54.180 --> 40:58.317
- Toby!
- Wait. It might not be safe out there.

41:02.388 --> 41:05.858
Grab his things
to keep him quiet.

41:05.891 --> 41:07.927
You, you don't have
to do this.

41:07.960 --> 41:10.029
- Stay.
- Let's go.

41:16.669 --> 41:19.038
Come on, lady.
Get in the van, lady.

41:19.071 --> 41:21.674
- Someone's got Auntie B!
- Call 911!

41:32.251 --> 41:35.855
- Will you shut that dog up?
- Yeah, yeah.

41:35.888 --> 41:39.225
Here, do you want the ball?

41:39.258 --> 41:44.330
Do you want the ball?

41:57.176 --> 41:58.677
- The phone won't work.
- What?

41:58.711 --> 41:59.945
It won't even turn on.

41:59.979 --> 42:01.680
Someone must've cut
the phone line.

42:01.714 --> 42:04.150
They're gonna get away!

42:04.183 --> 42:06.285
Not if I can help it.
Stay here.

42:06.318 --> 42:07.386
I'm coming with you.

42:08.454 --> 42:11.190
- What was that?
- I don't know!

42:11.223 --> 42:12.825
It won't start.

42:12.858 --> 42:14.793
It won't start!

42:14.827 --> 42:16.962
Well, did you try
turning the key?

42:27.473 --> 42:30.809
Ah-ah-ah, don't make me snap it.

42:35.981 --> 42:38.384
Work, work, work.

42:40.786 --> 42:43.889
Whoo! Back in business.

42:43.923 --> 42:47.359
- What about the dog?
- Forget about the dog.

42:47.393 --> 42:50.029
Let's get out of here
before the cops come.

42:50.062 --> 42:51.397
Yeah, go!

43:11.050 --> 43:12.484
They're all gone.

43:13.519 --> 43:15.087
- Toby?
- Toby!

43:15.120 --> 43:16.822
Where is he going?

43:25.231 --> 43:27.032
Hold up.

43:27.066 --> 43:30.035
Be careful,
there may be aliens.

43:30.069 --> 43:33.005
I don't think it's aliens.
Let's stay close.

43:43.115 --> 43:44.483
This is Agent Toby Barks

43:44.516 --> 43:46.852
requesting
Agent Laura Prescott.

43:46.885 --> 43:50.389
Security clearance
1-1-5-6-2-4-5.

43:50.422 --> 43:53.859
Repeat, Agent Barks
for Agent Prescott,

43:53.892 --> 43:57.229
security clearance
1-1-5-6-2-4-5.

43:57.263 --> 43:58.497
Do you copy?

43:58.530 --> 44:01.200
This is Agent Barks,
do you copy?

44:01.233 --> 44:04.536
Does anybody read me?
Hello?

44:04.570 --> 44:06.405
Code red,
can you read me?

44:06.438 --> 44:07.806
This is not a drill.

44:07.840 --> 44:09.808
Repeat,
this is not a drill.

44:14.380 --> 44:17.950
This just keeps getting
weirder and weirder.

44:24.256 --> 44:26.925
Anybody?
Anybody at all?

44:28.594 --> 44:31.530
Can anyone hear me?
Answer.

44:31.563 --> 44:33.399
Uh, hi, guys.

44:33.432 --> 44:35.134
This can't be real.

44:36.502 --> 44:39.038
- Toby?
- Uh, hi, guys.

44:39.071 --> 44:40.873
Toby,
are you talking?

44:40.906 --> 44:44.310
No, I'm just...
I... yes.

44:44.343 --> 44:46.045
Auntie B gets snatched in
the middle of the night,

44:46.078 --> 44:48.347
thrown in to a van,
our dog is talking to us,

44:48.380 --> 44:51.016
and we're in the middle of some kind
of, I don't know, secret base.

44:51.050 --> 44:54.053
- Is this a secret base?
- It's the Barkcave.

44:54.086 --> 44:57.523
Right, the Barkcave, makes sense.
I know what this is.

44:57.556 --> 45:00.392
We're still sleeping.
This is a dream, I'm dreaming.

45:00.426 --> 45:05.197
I already pinched myself
six times. This is real.

45:05.230 --> 45:08.567
Kate's right, this is very real.
Don't have time to explain it.

45:08.600 --> 45:10.436
Well, excuse me for being
a little weirded out

45:10.469 --> 45:12.404
that my dog is talkin'
to me right now.

45:12.438 --> 45:14.406
Look, I'm not just your dog.

45:14.440 --> 45:16.442
I'm a highly trained
government agent.

45:16.475 --> 45:19.545
Your Auntie B and I work
for a top secret organization.

45:19.578 --> 45:22.214
You've gotta be kidding me!
So you're like a 00-doggie?

45:22.247 --> 45:24.616
Will you just listen?
We're running out of time!

45:24.651 --> 45:27.586
Auntie B invented some real
game-changing gadgets

45:27.619 --> 45:29.455
and someone must be
after her.

45:29.488 --> 45:31.890
- Who do you think it is?
- Well, only a few people know

45:31.924 --> 45:33.992
where to find Auntie B
this weekend.

45:34.026 --> 45:35.894
Sadly, they all work
for the agency.

45:35.928 --> 45:37.196
So, that means?

45:37.229 --> 45:38.430
That means someone
from the inside

45:38.464 --> 45:41.166
double-crossed us.

45:41.200 --> 45:43.936
Computer, locate
van make and model.

45:48.941 --> 45:51.543
Can't be too many of those
on the road in this area.

45:51.577 --> 45:54.413
Computer, I need
an engine sound match

45:54.446 --> 45:55.614
on a '96 Bounder.

45:55.648 --> 45:58.083
Activate the doggie ear.

45:58.117 --> 46:00.219
- That's them?
- Bingo.

46:00.252 --> 46:02.354
That's the access road
near the school.

46:02.388 --> 46:04.189
Shouldn't you call
backup or something?

46:04.223 --> 46:07.559
I need to handle this myself.
I can't trust anyone yet.

46:07.593 --> 46:09.361
You can trust us.
I'm coming with you.

46:09.395 --> 46:10.429
Me, too.

46:10.462 --> 46:12.197
Oh, no, you're not.

46:12.231 --> 46:14.500
We're Auntie B's family!
We're not just gonna sit around

46:14.533 --> 46:16.402
while someone breaks
into our house and takes her.

46:16.435 --> 46:18.070
Absolutely not!

46:18.103 --> 46:20.105
Your safety has been
jeopardized enough as it is.

46:20.139 --> 46:22.274
It's just too dangerous.

46:22.307 --> 46:24.443
Well, if you don't
let us come, we'll tell Daddy

46:24.476 --> 46:26.713
and everyone will know
that you're a secret agent.

46:26.746 --> 46:29.415
Ah, poop!

46:29.448 --> 46:31.450
- You're driving.
- What?

46:31.483 --> 46:34.052
- You heard me.
- I don't even have my license.

46:34.086 --> 46:35.621
Well, my paws
don't reach the pedals,

46:35.655 --> 46:38.590
and we're tails-deep
in a government emergency here.

46:38.624 --> 46:40.559
So I think we can make
an exception.

46:42.394 --> 46:45.297
I believe in you.
You're the man for this mission.

46:45.330 --> 46:47.332
Now, let's go
before I lose the scent.

46:55.441 --> 46:57.242
You can do this.

46:57.276 --> 46:59.712
Be the road.

46:59.746 --> 47:01.513
The road and you.

47:03.182 --> 47:06.351
Hm.

47:15.127 --> 47:18.297
You got this, kid.
Just focus on the yellow lines.

47:18.330 --> 47:22.234
My dog is giving
my brother driving tips.

47:22.267 --> 47:24.069
Okay, what's
it say, Kate?

47:24.102 --> 47:27.172
Um, okay,
take a left up ahead.

47:27.206 --> 47:28.574
Left up ahead,
got it.

47:30.075 --> 47:32.444
Now, 100 feet,
turn signals.

47:34.613 --> 47:36.348
Come to a complete stop,

47:36.381 --> 47:38.383
check all directions
for oncoming traffic.

47:38.417 --> 47:41.119
- Good, good.
- Okay.

47:42.488 --> 47:46.158
Okay, slowly accelerate
into the turn.

47:50.697 --> 47:52.765
Okay, now what?

47:52.799 --> 47:55.702
Um, take a right on Davison Ave.
Take a right!

47:55.735 --> 47:59.304
Okay, got it.
What's next?

47:59.338 --> 48:01.273
Um, that's
where the signal ends.

48:02.407 --> 48:04.109
No way they're still
gonna be there.

48:04.142 --> 48:06.278
Don't worry,
I'll smell 'em the rest of the way.

48:06.311 --> 48:07.647
Huh?

48:11.450 --> 48:13.820
- Left! Go left!
- What?

48:13.853 --> 48:16.656
Left! He said go left!

48:23.128 --> 48:25.163
- Straight!
- Straight.

48:25.197 --> 48:26.666
I like that one,
it's easy.

48:35.207 --> 48:36.843
Oh, brother.

48:36.876 --> 48:42.180
Oh, Bretty? I think
they want you to pull over.

48:42.214 --> 48:44.116
Yeah, it's the fuzz.
Pull over.

48:48.655 --> 48:51.523
Oh, man! Now I'm never
gonna get my license.

48:51.557 --> 48:53.158
I'll be banned for life!

48:53.191 --> 48:55.728
Brett, relax!
I'll do the talking.

48:59.131 --> 49:00.833
Okay, everybody,
keep cool.

49:00.867 --> 49:03.803
Keep your cool.
I got this.

49:09.909 --> 49:12.544
License and registration,
please.

49:12.578 --> 49:15.748
Evening, officer. What seems
to be the problem?

49:17.482 --> 49:20.619
I'm sorry, was I speeding?
I really didn't think so.

49:20.653 --> 49:23.121
This is a 35, right?

49:23.155 --> 49:26.626
We had reports of a van
speeding through a minute ago.

49:26.659 --> 49:29.294
Guess I got
the wrong one.

49:29.328 --> 49:33.131
Oh, I see. Well, have
a nice night, officer.

49:33.165 --> 49:35.601
Yeah, you guys take care.

49:40.372 --> 49:42.541
Stay safe!

49:42.574 --> 49:45.410
Wow, I gotta cut back
on the overtime.

49:45.444 --> 49:48.213
I cannot believe that worked.

49:48.246 --> 49:49.749
Works every time, baby.

49:49.782 --> 49:51.784
All right, let's get back
on the scent.

49:51.818 --> 49:54.219
Guys, it's Auntie B!

49:54.252 --> 49:55.922
Bingo!
Nice spot, Kate!

49:55.955 --> 49:58.223
Okay, I need you two
to stay in here.

49:58.256 --> 50:01.460
Let me guess,
it's too dangerous for kids?

50:01.493 --> 50:03.495
No. Well, yes,

50:03.528 --> 50:05.732
but the truth is,
I need you in here.

50:05.765 --> 50:08.600
Everything I see will be
transmitted on that tablet.

50:08.635 --> 50:11.536
I may need you for some intel
if I get in a jam,

50:11.570 --> 50:13.706
so be on the ready
to haul out of here

50:13.740 --> 50:15.240
once I rescue Auntie B.

50:15.273 --> 50:16.541
Got it.

50:16.575 --> 50:18.343
It's go time.

50:18.377 --> 50:20.747
Paws in the middle!

50:20.780 --> 50:22.849
Barks!

50:55.682 --> 50:58.316
Auntie B!

50:58.350 --> 51:01.954
No, no, no!

51:01.988 --> 51:04.256
What do you mean...

51:04.289 --> 51:07.627
...you couldn't get the dog?

51:07.660 --> 51:10.295
I could've hired
a dog catcher

51:10.328 --> 51:12.765
for far less money
and better results!

51:12.799 --> 51:15.868
If I knew we had to nab
some secret agent dog,

51:15.902 --> 51:17.302
I would've asked
for more money.

51:17.335 --> 51:20.572
Not <i>some</i> secret agent dog,

51:20.605 --> 51:23.241
a <i>talking</i> secret agent dog!

51:23.275 --> 51:25.712
Well, since you got
half your job done,

51:25.745 --> 51:28.380
I will offer you
half of the money,

51:28.413 --> 51:31.851
and you're still security
until this whole thing is over.

51:31.884 --> 51:35.988
And if you have a problem with it...

51:36.022 --> 51:40.693
I'll just call my friends
and tell them all about you.

51:40.727 --> 51:43.495
No problem.

51:43.528 --> 51:46.298
"No problem."
Good answer.

51:47.566 --> 51:50.002
Will you stop
squirming? Geez!

51:50.036 --> 51:52.672
<i>♪ Auntie B, Auntie B ♪</i>

51:52.705 --> 51:56.709
<i>♪ Oh my favorite money tree ♪</i>

51:56.743 --> 51:59.511
- Bazooka?
- Mm.

51:59.544 --> 52:01.480
It's my favorite.
Well, later.

52:01.513 --> 52:03.950
I came to you,

52:03.983 --> 52:05.885
and I offered you a deal,

52:05.918 --> 52:08.553
and you gave me a flat no,

52:08.587 --> 52:13.025
not knowing that I'm the kind of
guy you never say no to.

52:13.059 --> 52:15.795
My mother used
to call me "tenacious."

52:15.828 --> 52:19.397
She called me "solipsistic," too.
That was when I was six,

52:19.431 --> 52:22.034
and "Mr. Smartypants"
when I was 27.

52:22.068 --> 52:26.338
But I'll show you, Mommy!
I'll show all of you.

52:29.776 --> 52:31.778
You'll never get away
with this, Lane!

52:31.811 --> 52:34.312
Oh, won't I? Is that
your expert opinion?

52:34.346 --> 52:36.515
I think I already have!

52:38.651 --> 52:41.053
Because no one knows
you're here.

52:41.087 --> 52:43.756
Ladies and gentlemen,

52:43.790 --> 52:48.728
I introduce to you
Dr. Bonnie Barks!

52:48.761 --> 52:52.531
We're old chums
and collaborators...

52:52.564 --> 52:55.668
for huzzum huzzum years.

52:55.701 --> 52:59.739
She's the new head
of research and development

52:59.772 --> 53:01.974
at Lane Technologies,

53:02.008 --> 53:05.077
but you can call her...

53:05.111 --> 53:07.046
- Auntie B.
- Oh, yay!

53:10.116 --> 53:11.984
You're all
breaking the law!

53:15.487 --> 53:18.791
This man is a traitor
to the United States,

53:18.825 --> 53:20.693
and you're just as guilty
as he is

53:20.726 --> 53:22.728
if you don't free me at once!

53:22.762 --> 53:23.830
Oh, that's good,
that's good,

53:23.863 --> 53:26.032
appeal to their consciences.

53:26.065 --> 53:28.768
You don't know that they're paid
so much they don't have any.

53:30.036 --> 53:31.771
What do you want from me?

53:31.804 --> 53:36.541
Don't you know with that brilliant
bulb of a brain of yours?

53:36.575 --> 53:38.744
I want that B Link!
I want schematics,

53:38.778 --> 53:40.813
I want plans, I want data.

53:40.847 --> 53:44.150
I wanna know
how to make that dog talk!

53:44.183 --> 53:46.618
Years of hard work
and research

53:46.652 --> 53:49.487
just thrown away
on consumerism?

53:49.521 --> 53:51.456
It's a real shame.

53:51.489 --> 53:54.426
Shame on you.
My mommy used to say,

53:54.459 --> 53:57.830
"Self, self, self,
why don't you think about me?"

53:57.864 --> 53:59.464
Well, I'm not
giving you anything,

53:59.497 --> 54:01.433
not one shred
of information.

54:01.466 --> 54:04.070
Well, then my associates
are right here,

54:04.103 --> 54:06.839
and they are experts
at extracting

54:06.873 --> 54:08.908
all the information I need.

54:16.916 --> 54:19.986
How you doin',
Auntie B?

54:20.019 --> 54:21.654
What's that?

54:21.687 --> 54:23.990
I don't know,
but it's blue.

54:24.023 --> 54:25.191
What does that mean?

54:25.224 --> 54:27.860
Well, all the people
have been red dots,

54:27.894 --> 54:29.629
and Toby's a blue dot...

54:29.662 --> 54:31.197
So that means
there's another dog?

54:31.230 --> 54:33.132
Toby, I think
there's another dog,

54:33.165 --> 54:34.667
and he's coming your way.

54:34.700 --> 54:36.601
Don't do it.

54:37.703 --> 54:40.840
Don't... don't...

54:43.910 --> 54:45.711
What was that?

54:45.745 --> 54:47.713
Good ol' Angus
must've found somethin'.

54:47.747 --> 54:52.018
Fan out, fan out
and find out what that is.

54:52.051 --> 54:53.953
Uh-oh...

54:53.986 --> 54:56.989
Whoa! Whoa!

54:57.023 --> 54:58.590
Yes!

55:02.929 --> 55:05.597
Ow, ow, that was the dog.
That was Toby!

55:05.631 --> 55:07.733
Come on, you imbeciles!

55:07.767 --> 55:11.070
Get me my talking dog!

55:16.608 --> 55:20.012
Activate Mr. Sandman.

55:27.219 --> 55:28.788
Ooh.

55:46.973 --> 55:48.674
Angus?

55:48.708 --> 55:50.710
Half-wits?

55:50.743 --> 55:52.610
What are you doing sleeping
in the middle of the night?

55:52.645 --> 55:56.115
I was just resting
my eyes. Geez.

55:56.148 --> 55:57.984
Mommy, I don't wanna
go to school today.

55:59.819 --> 56:02.755
I'm afraid to ask this,
but do I look like your mother?

56:02.788 --> 56:05.557
Get up, get up! Go, go, go!
We're losing him!

56:05.590 --> 56:06.792
Go, go, go, go!

56:06.826 --> 56:07.893
- Go, go!
- Sleepin' on the job.

56:11.297 --> 56:13.099
Aw, no!

56:13.132 --> 56:17.636
You brainless imbeciles
let him get away!

56:17.670 --> 56:19.537
- We'll go find him!
- We got it!

56:19.571 --> 56:21.640
No, no, don't go
anywhere! I need you here.

56:21.674 --> 56:23.743
I gotta get
this show on the road.

56:23.776 --> 56:26.611
All right, tighten security.

56:26.645 --> 56:31.183
Hire reinforcements.
Do something to help me!

56:33.686 --> 56:37.056
I have to go have a little
chat with our guest.

56:37.089 --> 56:39.725
Oh...

56:39.759 --> 56:43.029
Round up some goons.
We got a job to do.

56:43.062 --> 56:46.332
Sure thing! I'll just go
put an ad in the crime paper!

56:52.604 --> 56:53.806
Well, we didn't get
what we came for,

56:53.839 --> 56:55.775
but we made it
out of there in one piece.

56:55.808 --> 56:57.676
But how are we
gonna save Auntie B?

56:57.710 --> 56:59.645
Don't worry, kid.
I have a plan.

56:59.678 --> 57:03.082
Good. A plan is good.

57:03.115 --> 57:05.684
At first I didn't know who I
could trust within the agency.

57:05.718 --> 57:07.920
Now that we know Agent
Lane's the crooked one,

57:07.953 --> 57:10.956
I can get by with a little
help from my friends.

57:56.769 --> 57:57.970
I finally figured out

57:58.003 --> 58:00.306
what the B in Auntie B
stands for...

58:00.339 --> 58:02.341
the best and the brightest!

58:02.374 --> 58:05.244
Oh, Bonnie,
you truly are a genius.

58:05.277 --> 58:07.012
Oh, can it, Lane!

58:07.046 --> 58:09.782
Ooh, I am sincere.

58:09.815 --> 58:13.152
I speak
from my heart's core.

58:17.323 --> 58:20.226
Look at these scientists!

58:20.259 --> 58:23.329
My scientists,
the best that money could buy!

58:23.362 --> 58:26.832
The greatest minds
in the universe!

58:26.866 --> 58:29.802
Nobel Prize winners!

58:29.835 --> 58:33.205
All of them working for
what seems like an eternity

58:33.239 --> 58:37.409
trying to create what
you have already created.

58:37.443 --> 58:40.179
You know,
billions and billions

58:40.212 --> 58:44.083
of overseas dollars
from my investors

58:44.116 --> 58:47.153
have gone into
supporting them

58:47.186 --> 58:50.022
trying to do
what you've already done.

58:51.223 --> 58:54.093
We attempted

58:54.126 --> 58:58.731
on every single kind
of species.

58:58.764 --> 59:00.666
We tried a parrot.

59:08.240 --> 59:09.742
A goat.

59:17.016 --> 59:20.920
<i>A bunny, a turtle,
a mouse, a horse!</i>

59:23.522 --> 59:27.226
Say "not by the hair
of my chinny-chin-chin."

59:29.028 --> 59:31.730
All right,
BLTs for lunch!

59:32.531 --> 59:34.300
We even tried a fish.

59:39.038 --> 59:41.273
We got the same results
every time.

59:41.307 --> 59:43.976
Guess what?
We got nothing!

59:45.244 --> 59:48.147
I thought the cat would work,
I was sure!

59:48.180 --> 59:50.382
And we got something,
we did.

59:50.416 --> 59:53.052
I thought every little child
would wanna say good night

59:53.085 --> 59:55.087
to his own little
kissy kitty cat,

59:55.120 --> 59:57.923
and I would be so rich!

59:59.525 --> 1:00:02.895
Ew, humans, gross!
Please give me my space.

1:00:04.196 --> 1:00:06.799
You there, fathead,
what's for lunch?

1:00:08.067 --> 1:00:11.203
Fathead, fathead!

1:00:11.237 --> 1:00:14.473
Fathead, fathead!
I'm talking to you!

1:00:18.911 --> 1:00:22.047
Mouthy little furballs,
aren't they?

1:00:22.081 --> 1:00:24.718
"Fathead."
That really hurt.

1:00:26.218 --> 1:00:28.921
You were a good agent, Lane.

1:00:28.954 --> 1:00:32.291
I was not only a good agent,
I was a great agent!

1:00:32.324 --> 1:00:34.893
I was an excellent agent!

1:00:34.927 --> 1:00:38.130
But Uncle Benny's
got a mortgage.

1:00:38.163 --> 1:00:39.798
You see what I drive?

1:00:39.832 --> 1:00:41.500
Well, I guess for you

1:00:41.533 --> 1:00:44.069
making money is more
important than helping people,

1:00:44.103 --> 1:00:46.538
but for me,
it's the other way around.

1:00:46.572 --> 1:00:50.242
Oh, she's a wonderful woman.

1:00:50.276 --> 1:00:51.877
I can't say it
with a straight face.

1:00:51.910 --> 1:00:53.545
You know,

1:00:53.579 --> 1:00:56.915
there's still a chance
for you to give up peacefully.

1:00:56.949 --> 1:00:59.585
If you let me out right now,

1:00:59.618 --> 1:01:02.254
I'll tell the agency
to go easy on you

1:01:02.288 --> 1:01:04.556
just because you've been so reasonable.
How about that?

1:01:04.590 --> 1:01:07.826
That's very nice.
Let me think about that.

1:01:09.061 --> 1:01:13.132
I may have to change
my whole life's plan,

1:01:13.165 --> 1:01:16.535
but I will,
sincerely, I will.

1:01:16.568 --> 1:01:20.172
Joking!

1:01:20.205 --> 1:01:22.041
Let's cut to the chase.

1:01:22.074 --> 1:01:25.511
This is your workstation.

1:01:25.544 --> 1:01:28.947
You have all
the materials you need

1:01:28.981 --> 1:01:33.152
to make me a prototype
of that B Link.

1:01:33.185 --> 1:01:35.854
And if you refuse...

1:01:35.888 --> 1:01:39.858
we'll pay a little call
on your niece and nephew.

1:01:39.892 --> 1:01:42.461
And we won't be
quite as nice to them...

1:01:43.663 --> 1:01:45.531
as we were to you.

1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:50.969
All right, Lane, you win.

1:01:52.204 --> 1:01:53.939
Cut me free,
and I'll get to work.

1:01:53.972 --> 1:01:56.041
I said you were smart.

1:01:56.075 --> 1:01:58.243
All right, come on,
cut her loose.

1:01:58.277 --> 1:01:59.378
You have two hours.

1:01:59.411 --> 1:02:01.180
Get to work!

1:02:08.520 --> 1:02:11.156
Prescott, Hawk.

1:02:11.190 --> 1:02:12.558
Toby, what's wrong?

1:02:12.591 --> 1:02:15.294
Auntie B's in trouble.

1:02:15.327 --> 1:02:18.030
Well, what are we
waitin' for?

1:02:30.042 --> 1:02:31.477
Work fascinates me.

1:02:31.510 --> 1:02:36.982
I could sit
and watch it for hours.

1:02:37.015 --> 1:02:39.652
You're doing
a beautiful job.

1:02:39.686 --> 1:02:43.021
Just remember,
clock's ticking.

1:03:13.419 --> 1:03:15.087
Welcome to the party.

1:03:15.120 --> 1:03:18.056
I want all exits
on lockdown.

1:03:18.090 --> 1:03:21.193
Slanderella?
Slanderella?

1:03:21.226 --> 1:03:23.562
- Huh?
- Gimme a perimeter.

1:03:23.595 --> 1:03:24.731
Okay.

1:03:24.764 --> 1:03:28.200
Nobody in,
nobody out.

1:03:28.233 --> 1:03:32.304
You and you.
Follow me, boys.

1:03:39.578 --> 1:03:41.980
Well, it's ready.

1:03:42.014 --> 1:03:44.249
Oh, it's ready,
that's good, that's nice.

1:03:44.283 --> 1:03:45.752
It's ready! Oh!

1:03:45.785 --> 1:03:48.086
Hand it over to Uncle Benny.

1:03:49.321 --> 1:03:51.256
You got what you wanted,
now let me go.

1:03:51.290 --> 1:03:53.091
Oh, a deal's a deal,

1:03:53.125 --> 1:03:55.060
but let's just make sure
this baby works.

1:03:55.093 --> 1:03:56.128
Fair is fair.

1:03:56.161 --> 1:03:58.130
Mm-hmm, knock yourself out.

1:03:58.163 --> 1:04:00.065
Voice activated
and everything.

1:04:00.098 --> 1:04:02.367
Come here, Angus. Eh? Eh?

1:04:02.401 --> 1:04:05.270
All right, activate B Link.

1:04:06.505 --> 1:04:09.676
Hey, boss.
What can I do for you?

1:04:11.778 --> 1:04:15.214
My baby! It spoke to me!

1:04:15.247 --> 1:04:19.485
We did it, we did it!

1:04:26.492 --> 1:04:29.261
Looks like they set up
patrols along the perimeter.

1:04:29.294 --> 1:04:32.097
- We'll park offsite, sneak our way in.
- Copy that.

1:04:33.700 --> 1:04:35.501
I'll pull up here,

1:04:35.534 --> 1:04:37.503
and we'll tuck in
behind this building.

1:04:37.536 --> 1:04:39.538
Everybody know
what they're doing?

1:04:43.509 --> 1:04:45.645
It's showtime.

1:05:06.198 --> 1:05:09.568
Yoo-hoo! Hey, lady!
Lookin' for me?

1:05:10.837 --> 1:05:13.472
Oh, good!

1:05:13.505 --> 1:05:15.742
I was startin'
to get bored out here.

1:05:15.775 --> 1:05:17.409
Really?
Catch me if you can.

1:05:18.778 --> 1:05:22.682
Get him, get him,
get him! Go!

1:05:34.560 --> 1:05:36.228
Yes, yes,
that's right.

1:05:36.261 --> 1:05:39.264
120% fully functional.

1:05:39.298 --> 1:05:42.702
Your buyers are going to be
more than satisfied,

1:05:42.735 --> 1:05:47.205
and we'll be ready for
mass production next month.

1:05:47.239 --> 1:05:50.643
That's right!
Yes, yes, fantastic.

1:05:50.677 --> 1:05:52.210
<i>Domo arigato.</i>

1:05:54.346 --> 1:05:57.115
Enough, Lane!
Let me go!

1:05:57.149 --> 1:05:59.184
You know what?
I changed my mind.

1:05:59.217 --> 1:06:00.552
She's coming with us.

1:06:00.586 --> 1:06:02.154
Wait, what?
You can't do that.

1:06:02.187 --> 1:06:05.257
I can do anything
that I put my mind to now.

1:06:05.290 --> 1:06:07.526
What if something
breaks, eh?

1:06:07.559 --> 1:06:09.127
We have nobody here
to fix it,

1:06:09.161 --> 1:06:13.633
and I'm not going to let
that happen ever again.

1:06:23.609 --> 1:06:25.812
Wait!

1:06:36.388 --> 1:06:38.658
That's right.
Excellent, yes.

1:06:38.691 --> 1:06:40.359
Boys and girls,

1:06:40.392 --> 1:06:44.196
we need to vacate
these premises immediately.

1:06:44.229 --> 1:06:48.600
So destroy any evidence
that we were ever here,

1:06:48.635 --> 1:06:51.738
especially
incriminating evidence.

1:06:51.771 --> 1:06:52.939
Nothing left.

1:06:52.972 --> 1:06:54.606
Lane Technologies sign,

1:06:54.641 --> 1:06:56.809
I'd like to keep that
for my rumpus room

1:06:56.843 --> 1:06:59.311
if anyone has a stepladder.

1:06:59.344 --> 1:07:01.948
Now let's crate up Porky,
shall we?

1:07:01.981 --> 1:07:04.917
And anything too heavy
to lift, burn!

1:07:04.951 --> 1:07:06.719
All right,
quick like bunnies!

1:07:06.753 --> 1:07:08.655
That's good.
Quick like bunnies!

1:07:08.688 --> 1:07:11.490
Everything gone!

1:07:33.980 --> 1:07:36.916
- Who's that?
- Looks like some kids.

1:07:36.949 --> 1:07:38.583
What do they want?

1:07:38.617 --> 1:07:40.352
Why don't you go
and ask 'em?

1:07:49.729 --> 1:07:51.263
Hello, sir.
We're raising money

1:07:51.296 --> 1:07:52.965
for my softball team,
the Ladybugs,

1:07:52.999 --> 1:07:54.399
and we're going door-to-door

1:07:54.433 --> 1:07:56.535
asking local businesses
for sponsorships.

1:07:58.037 --> 1:08:00.439
You kids can't be here.
This is private property.

1:08:00.472 --> 1:08:02.875
We're so sorry, sir.
I just got my license,

1:08:02.909 --> 1:08:05.812
and I promised my dad
I'd take my sister around.

1:08:05.845 --> 1:08:08.513
She just loves softball.

1:08:08.547 --> 1:08:09.982
You know what?

1:08:10.016 --> 1:08:12.517
I love softball too.
I do, I do, hold on.

1:08:20.525 --> 1:08:21.928
This is for you.

1:08:21.961 --> 1:08:24.329
- Really?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, hold on.

1:08:24.362 --> 1:08:26.364
Oh, Buzz!

1:08:29.301 --> 1:08:31.403
Come out here, cheapskate!

1:08:31.436 --> 1:08:34.406
Pony up a few bucks for the
kids, for their softball team.

1:08:35.607 --> 1:08:38.845
We are softball fans.

1:08:55.460 --> 1:08:57.362
Agent Barks,
do you copy?

1:08:57.395 --> 1:09:00.298
Yeah, a little busy
right now.

1:09:00.332 --> 1:09:02.001
Another canine
is inbound.

1:09:06.438 --> 1:09:08.507
Not again.

1:09:08.540 --> 1:09:11.644
Hey there, pup.
Boy, am I glad I can talk!

1:09:11.677 --> 1:09:14.080
Now, I can tell
all the other dogs

1:09:14.113 --> 1:09:17.482
how I kicked your tail
up and down this warehouse.

1:09:17.516 --> 1:09:19.584
Sunny Wolf, it's Angus.

1:09:19.618 --> 1:09:21.788
Got that little pooch
you're lookin' for.

1:09:21.821 --> 1:09:23.790
Meet me in the back hallway.

1:09:25.590 --> 1:09:27.627
You know, your boss
is a real crumb.

1:09:27.660 --> 1:09:29.594
We could use a guy
like you on our side.

1:09:29.629 --> 1:09:31.964
You know,
the good guys?

1:09:31.998 --> 1:09:34.366
Yeah, well, the bad guys
don't seem so bad

1:09:34.399 --> 1:09:36.769
when they dole out
a million treats.

1:09:36.803 --> 1:09:39.038
Good guys ever pay
you a million treats?

1:09:40.472 --> 1:09:42.541
No, but at least
I can go to sleep

1:09:42.574 --> 1:09:45.410
knowing I'm doing
the right thing.

1:09:45.443 --> 1:09:47.880
Oh, I sleep just fine,
little guy.

1:09:47.914 --> 1:09:50.783
On a big pile of treats.

1:09:55.855 --> 1:09:58.825
Well, end of the road,
little fella.

1:10:01.560 --> 1:10:04.797
Just give up,
before I unleash the beast on you.

1:10:06.498 --> 1:10:08.466
You asked for it.

1:10:08.500 --> 1:10:09.769
Angus, get him!

1:10:26.786 --> 1:10:28.120
What the...?

1:10:30.156 --> 1:10:32.825
Oh, I'm so glad
you're okay!

1:10:34.126 --> 1:10:36.062
Not so fast.

1:10:36.095 --> 1:10:37.797
Goons, sic 'em.

1:10:39.031 --> 1:10:41.767
You're surrounded,
both of you.

1:10:49.041 --> 1:10:50.442
Time to move in.

1:10:51.610 --> 1:10:53.478
Take this.
Toby gave it to us,

1:10:53.511 --> 1:10:54.647
but we don't know
what it is.

1:10:54.680 --> 1:10:56.015
The Crossbone.

1:10:56.048 --> 1:10:58.050
Auntie B told me
all about this thing.

1:10:58.084 --> 1:11:00.653
Let's hope it works.

1:11:00.686 --> 1:11:03.055
Hey, kid, you think
you can drive this monster?

1:11:03.089 --> 1:11:04.589
Like the wind, sir.

1:11:04.623 --> 1:11:06.491
That's what I like to hear.

1:11:06.524 --> 1:11:07.693
You're the extraction team.

1:11:11.563 --> 1:11:13.531
It's go time.

1:11:13.565 --> 1:11:17.103
Oh, you should've run
while you had the chance.

1:11:17.136 --> 1:11:20.873
Look!
Now I have two for one.

1:11:28.714 --> 1:11:30.883
You know... ahem.

1:11:30.917 --> 1:11:33.986
It took me a long time
to develop the B Link.

1:11:34.020 --> 1:11:36.521
I couldn't make it work.

1:11:36.554 --> 1:11:40.458
It got so hot, I must've melted
through a dozen prototypes.

1:11:44.931 --> 1:11:47.499
All the circuits
would overheat.

1:11:49.835 --> 1:11:51.971
Darn thing would cook
from the inside out.

1:11:52.004 --> 1:11:54.674
But I figured it out.

1:11:54.707 --> 1:11:56.742
Liquid nitrogen.

1:12:00.112 --> 1:12:02.148
But I had to be careful.

1:12:02.181 --> 1:12:04.216
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

1:12:04.250 --> 1:12:08.220
Well, if I use too much...

1:12:09.855 --> 1:12:11.691
it would freeze!

1:12:14.727 --> 1:12:15.795
Ah!

1:12:17.863 --> 1:12:19.198
Activate Crossbone.

1:12:32.878 --> 1:12:35.748
Agent Toby Barks.

1:12:35.781 --> 1:12:37.717
- Hey, hey, hey!
- I've heard enough from you!

1:12:39.919 --> 1:12:41.854
I'm running away!

1:12:53.766 --> 1:12:59.305
Come on!

1:12:59.338 --> 1:13:01.173
Yah!

1:13:05.011 --> 1:13:08.580
You're trapped, Lane!
There's nowhere else to run!

1:13:19.859 --> 1:13:23.095
You still have a chance
to make this right, Lane.

1:13:30.703 --> 1:13:33.005
Trapped like a gray rat.

1:13:34.373 --> 1:13:36.876
Just...

1:13:36.909 --> 1:13:41.680
turn yourself in,
and give up now.

1:13:47.720 --> 1:13:49.321
What did mother used to say?

1:13:49.355 --> 1:13:53.659
When cornered,
use what you got.

1:14:08.107 --> 1:14:09.809
Yah!

1:14:45.945 --> 1:14:47.379
It's time
to face the music.

1:14:47.413 --> 1:14:49.281
Won't get me
without a fight.

1:15:05.965 --> 1:15:08.734
Come on,
let's do this!

1:15:15.341 --> 1:15:17.977
And that's
what I'm talkin' about.

1:15:18.010 --> 1:15:20.112
- Still got it.
- Yeah, we do.

1:15:23.149 --> 1:15:26.418
Oh, hey, guys.

1:15:26.452 --> 1:15:28.220
See what we did?

1:15:28.254 --> 1:15:30.756
Well, go arrest them.

1:15:38.030 --> 1:15:39.765
Tsk.

1:15:52.211 --> 1:15:53.279
Wow.

1:15:54.480 --> 1:15:56.148
Yeah.

1:16:03.222 --> 1:16:04.456
Outstanding work.

1:16:04.490 --> 1:16:06.458
Check out the human popsicle.

1:16:06.492 --> 1:16:09.862
Oh, don't worry,
he'll thaw out in a few hours.

1:16:12.097 --> 1:16:13.465
Or a few days.

1:16:13.499 --> 1:16:16.402
I don't remember.

1:16:36.522 --> 1:16:38.857
There's my family!

1:16:38.891 --> 1:16:40.192
Auntie B!

1:16:53.305 --> 1:16:55.941
Ah, look who's talkin' now!

1:16:55.975 --> 1:16:59.144
How about some petting?
Oh, that feels good.

1:17:15.394 --> 1:17:16.996
I just don't get it.

1:17:17.029 --> 1:17:18.464
We've been out here
since four in the morning,

1:17:18.497 --> 1:17:19.832
we've done everything
by the book

1:17:19.865 --> 1:17:21.267
and still nothing.

1:17:24.436 --> 1:17:26.205
Wait a minute,
what do you got there?

1:17:26.238 --> 1:17:29.541
Well, it's a little trick
that my daughter taught me.

1:17:31.477 --> 1:17:33.212
Is that a gummy worm?

1:17:33.245 --> 1:17:35.547
Sure is!
You wanna try it?

1:17:35.581 --> 1:17:39.551
Um, no, thanks, I'll stick
to the real worms.

1:17:39.585 --> 1:17:42.988
- Suit yourself.
- Hey, I'll try one.

1:17:43.989 --> 1:17:47.059
Yes, sir, sure.

1:17:47.092 --> 1:17:48.927
Here we go.

1:17:50.262 --> 1:17:54.133
It's, uh, create your own
luck, right, sir?

1:17:54.166 --> 1:17:55.567
I like your attitude, Teddy.

1:17:55.601 --> 1:17:58.971
- Gummy me up.
- There you go.

1:17:59.004 --> 1:18:00.539
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

1:18:00.572 --> 1:18:02.908
Alrighty.

1:18:02.941 --> 1:18:04.410
Here goes nothin'.

1:18:05.911 --> 1:18:07.579
Oh! Hey...

1:18:07.613 --> 1:18:09.948
Hey, nice... nice cast, sir,
that was a good job.

1:18:09.982 --> 1:18:12.918
- Thank you, Teddy.
- Yeah.

1:18:12.951 --> 1:18:16.088
You know, I hear you can catch
Bigfoot with Sour Patch Kids.

1:18:16.121 --> 1:18:18.457
Oh.

1:18:18.490 --> 1:18:20.893
I got one! I got one!

1:18:20.926 --> 1:18:22.594
- Come on.
- Oh, yeah!

1:18:22.629 --> 1:18:24.330
Oh, yeah, that looks
like a big one too, sir.

1:18:24.363 --> 1:18:26.432
Oh, he's a-fightin',
help me out here, Teddy.

1:18:26.465 --> 1:18:27.900
Oh, wait, yes, sir.

1:18:27.933 --> 1:18:28.901
Oh, my gosh!

1:18:28.934 --> 1:18:31.036
That is a big one!

1:18:31.070 --> 1:18:32.604
Whoa, there he is!

1:18:34.206 --> 1:18:36.075
Hold on, I got him, I got him!

1:18:36.108 --> 1:18:38.410
- There he is!
- Right here, right here!

1:18:38.444 --> 1:18:41.313
The legendary fish
of Falcon Lake!

1:18:41.347 --> 1:18:43.482
And you caught him, sir!
You caught him!

1:18:43.515 --> 1:18:46.618
Thanks to you
and your gummy worms, Teddy.

1:18:46.653 --> 1:18:48.554
I tell you,
it's innovative ideas like that

1:18:48.587 --> 1:18:50.622
that separate the good
from the great.

1:18:50.657 --> 1:18:53.292
How about you come
into my office Monday morning,

1:18:53.325 --> 1:18:55.394
and we talk about a promotion, hm?
What do you say?

1:18:55.427 --> 1:18:58.297
Yes, sir.

1:18:58.330 --> 1:19:00.366
- All right.
- Ahem.

1:19:02.334 --> 1:19:04.336
All right, Dave,
you can come too.

1:19:04.370 --> 1:19:07.406
After all, you were here when
we caught this glorious fish,

1:19:07.439 --> 1:19:09.408
so you must be
at least a little lucky.

1:19:10.643 --> 1:19:12.277
How 'bout we call it
an early day, huh?

1:19:12.311 --> 1:19:14.012
Pack it in,
beat the traffic?

1:19:14.046 --> 1:19:15.447
Because I don't think
we're gonna top this fella.

1:19:15.481 --> 1:19:17.950
- Yes, sir, great idea.
- Good idea.

1:19:17.983 --> 1:19:20.319
I can't wait
to surprise my kids!

1:19:23.055 --> 1:19:25.057
Nothin'. All right.

1:19:29.261 --> 1:19:33.499
Okay, we're just about
ready to rock and roll.

1:19:33.532 --> 1:19:36.235
- Hey, everybody, Dad's home early!
- Oh!

1:19:36.268 --> 1:19:39.204
Hey! Hi, sweetness,
look at you!

1:19:39.238 --> 1:19:40.939
- You look so great!
- Welcome back!

1:19:40.973 --> 1:19:42.341
Thanks, buddy.

1:19:42.374 --> 1:19:44.042
Wow, you're sharp too.
What's goin' on here?

1:19:44.076 --> 1:19:45.411
You guys look so...

1:19:45.444 --> 1:19:47.379
This is Agent Prescott.

1:19:48.748 --> 1:19:51.316
- Call me Laura.
- Wow!

1:19:51.350 --> 1:19:52.685
I'm sorry, hi.

1:19:52.719 --> 1:19:54.953
- I'm Ted. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

1:19:54.987 --> 1:19:57.089
Why-why-why are you guys
all dressed up, though?

1:19:57.122 --> 1:20:00.225
- What's going on?
- Funny you should ask that.

1:20:00.259 --> 1:20:01.593
Anybody see
a pair of cufflinks?

1:20:01.628 --> 1:20:03.429
I know I put 'em down
a minute ago,

1:20:03.462 --> 1:20:05.431
now they're gone.
Hey, Ted!

1:20:05.464 --> 1:20:06.666
Can I borrow
a pair of cufflinks?

1:20:10.703 --> 1:20:13.005
Um, why don't you go
throw a suit on,

1:20:13.038 --> 1:20:15.040
and I'll explain
everything on the way?

1:20:18.243 --> 1:20:19.445
Yeah, uh, okay.

1:20:22.281 --> 1:20:24.950
Welcome back, Ted.
Cufflinks!

1:20:31.758 --> 1:20:36.361
Is that why... Yeah.
He's gonna be fine.

1:21:37.356 --> 1:21:41.293
Thank you! Thank you so much,
everyone! Thank you!

1:21:42.594 --> 1:21:46.633
And, so you're hearing
that too, right?

1:21:49.468 --> 1:21:51.470
Yeah. Okay.

1:22:01.213 --> 1:22:03.215
Well, agents,
you know what that means.

1:22:04.416 --> 1:22:06.585
What...
What does that mean?

1:22:06.618 --> 1:22:08.788
Looks like
our next mission.

1:22:08.821 --> 1:22:12.591
Agent Barks,
you take the lead.

1:22:12.624 --> 1:22:15.728
Yes, sir.
Agents, mount up!
