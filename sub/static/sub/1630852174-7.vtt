Lookie who's
drivin' the sleigh.

00:09.509 --> 00:11.678
Candy fuckin' Smalls!

00:11.761 --> 00:13.847
Thanks for druggin'
us last year.

00:13.930 --> 00:16.349
Move it before
I rotisserie
your asses!

00:16.433 --> 00:18.893
Why should we?
You're not even Successor.

00:18.977 --> 00:22.439
You couldn't even get a job
as a shopping mall Santa.

00:22.522 --> 00:23.773
That's so mean.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.316
(accelerating)

00:26.067 --> 00:28.194
Rhonda! No!

00:29.946 --> 00:33.283

When you mess with Candy,
you get the cane.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.996
♪ ♪

00:41.708 --> 00:45.587
(cries)
That doofus, Devin, is
gonna be the next Santa.

00:47.672 --> 00:50.300
(joyful music playing)

00:59.768 --> 01:03.104
Ugh, you know,
I even practiced
how to act surprised

01:03.188 --> 01:04.814
when my name
was announced like,

01:04.898 --> 01:07.692
"Me? What? No!
I don't deserve it!

01:07.776 --> 01:11.821
I mean, I do,
but I'm just so honored."

01:11.905 --> 01:14.365
Ugh! It's so embarrassing.

01:14.449 --> 01:16.326
Do you have
honey mustard sauce?

01:16.409 --> 01:20.538
Devin is such a lame choice.
Santa used to be a radical.

01:20.622 --> 01:23.500
And now, he's just
a company stooge, a sellout.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.502
Yeah, well,
Jesus, so are you!

01:25.585 --> 01:28.963
You know, I know
about the Christmas
Spirit Bar conspiracy.

01:29.047 --> 01:30.507
You disgust me, Brent.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.592
I'm only here
because I've alienated

01:32.675 --> 01:34.886
everyone else
in my life, drug dealer.

01:34.969 --> 01:38.014
It wasn't my plan.
I was just following
Santa's orders.

01:38.097 --> 01:40.517
Wait a second, Santa's orders?
No, no, no, no.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.186
He told me himself he was
in the dark about the meth.

01:43.269 --> 01:44.270
Nothing happens at Santa Inc.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.022
without that guy
having a glove in it.

01:46.105 --> 01:47.941
The meth bars were
the tip of the iceberg

01:48.024 --> 01:50.610
when it came to the darkness
Santa was mired in...

01:50.693 --> 01:53.196
There were bribes
to keep the rich kids
off the Naughty list,

01:53.279 --> 01:57.408
and make sure the brats
got presents instead
of the coal they deserved.

01:57.492 --> 02:01.371
And there were insider trading
tips inside the stockings.

02:01.454 --> 02:04.123
Get it? Stockings?
Like, stock market?

02:04.207 --> 02:05.917
Whatever, he always
thought it was hilarious.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.628
Stockings.
Stock Market.
Hilarious.

02:08.711 --> 02:09.879
(laughs)

02:09.963 --> 02:10.880
Plus, those lap implants

02:10.964 --> 02:12.423
weren't just made
with silicone.

02:12.507 --> 02:14.384
There's illegal titanium
from the Middle East

02:14.467 --> 02:15.718
in those cozy suckers.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.720
So much corruption.

02:17.804 --> 02:18.888
Not hungry.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.974
Thanks for mentioning
that earlier,

sarcasm.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.018
Paparazzi 1:
How long is your schlong?

02:24.102 --> 02:25.103
Paparazzi 2:
Can you tie it in a knot?

02:25.186 --> 02:26.104
Paparazzi 1:
Can you tie it in a bow?

02:26.187 --> 02:27.063
Leave me alone!

02:27.146 --> 02:28.064
Paparazzi 3:
Can I tie it for you?

02:28.147 --> 02:29.732
Messin' around.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.359
Devin:
Ow!

02:31.442 --> 02:32.402
I'm back to assure you guys

02:32.485 --> 02:35.572
that none of this
will change anything.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.866
I'll still stay in my room,
write your papers,

02:37.949 --> 02:39.117
let you call me
Tub Of Shit.

02:39.200 --> 02:42.078
'pologies, bro,
but you need to move out.

02:42.161 --> 02:43.746
My coke dealer's
on the corner,

02:43.830 --> 02:45.498
and he is pissed
about the press.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.542
So, get your shit,
leave right now,

02:47.625 --> 02:51.754
love you, bro,
invite us to cool shit.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.923
Candy removed
the tracking devices.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.885
-No idea where the sleigh is.
-What a traitor!

02:56.968 --> 03:00.388
Did I tell you
when she told me
to "go fuck myself"?

03:00.471 --> 03:02.265
A jillion riveting
times, sire.

03:02.348 --> 03:06.686
Then, Mrs. Claus
leaves to shack up
with a fucking barkeep?

03:06.769 --> 03:08.688
Why is everyone
turning on me?!

03:08.771 --> 03:11.024
I'm fuckin' Santa!
Everyone loves me.

03:11.107 --> 03:14.068
Mick Jagger texts
me every day.

03:14.152 --> 03:15.612
He's thinkin' of growin'
an old guy goatee,

03:15.695 --> 03:17.614
and I was like,
why would you cover
up those lips, idiot?

03:17.697 --> 03:19.657
Everyone loves
those fuckin' lips,
which reminds me.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.159
Did you find out who was
selling my beard hair?

03:21.242 --> 03:25.788
Uh, no. Very hard to track.
All those tiny hairs.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.625
Doorbell Carolers (singing):
♪ Answer the door ♪

03:28.708 --> 03:31.252
-♪ Answer, answer ♪
-Fuck! This doorbell
was so cool at first.

03:31.336 --> 03:35.423
What I would not
give for a simple,
"Ding dong! Ding dong!"

03:35.506 --> 03:39.010
-(Doorbell Carolers crying)
-That's so mean! We try so hard.

03:41.429 --> 03:42.764
Devin?
Why are you here?

03:42.847 --> 03:43.806
He's your Successor.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.725
Once you die,
he becomes Santa.

03:45.808 --> 03:47.810
Logically, he's,
probably, come
to murder you.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.479
No, I would never kill anyone!

03:49.562 --> 03:52.023
I just was wonderin' if I could
crash for a couple nights?

03:52.106 --> 03:55.652
Stay as long as you want.
You know, you are like
the son I never had.

03:55.735 --> 03:57.153
You used to say
that to me.

03:57.236 --> 03:58.905
Come in, Dev.
You look like a guy

03:58.988 --> 04:00.907
who appreciates
a half-stale sheet cake.

04:00.990 --> 04:03.451
My fourth favorite food?
How did you know?

04:03.534 --> 04:05.161
Santa:
‘Cause it's my
third favorite food!

04:05.244 --> 04:06.496
I've had it!

04:06.579 --> 04:07.664
God, I'm mad!

04:07.747 --> 04:09.207
Santa Inc. is so evil.

04:09.290 --> 04:11.459
So, stay here at Amazon
and work with me.

04:11.542 --> 04:13.878
Fuck the North Pole!
The future is all about the

04:13.962 --> 04:15.296
(sings) Northwest!

04:15.380 --> 04:18.716
At least Amazon's not pretending
to be something it isn't.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.009
It knows it sucks.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.345
Exactly!
And we do amazing work.

04:22.428 --> 04:23.763
Ordering face cleanser in bulk,

04:23.846 --> 04:26.641
and havin' it delivered
in 11 seconds is everything!

04:26.724 --> 04:28.601
Your traitorous family
and your idiot friends

04:28.685 --> 04:30.228
who abandoned you are nothing.

04:30.311 --> 04:32.605
Whoa, wait.
Cookie and Goldie aren't idiots,

04:32.689 --> 04:34.357
and I betrayed my family, too.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.401
(sighs) Whatever.
You know what I mean.

04:36.484 --> 04:39.862
Now hop on your
new mountain bike,
and join me.

04:39.946 --> 04:42.281
-Are you in?
-Well...

04:44.409 --> 04:47.745
No, I-I'm sorry.
Santa Inc. is my home.

04:47.829 --> 04:51.207
Even if everyone hates me,
shuns me, laughs at me,

04:51.290 --> 04:54.377
I have to at least try
to help make things better.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.087
But, truly,
thanks for everything.

04:56.170 --> 04:58.172
And, hey, thank you
for the snacks, Curtis.

04:58.256 --> 05:00.967
Those chicken nuggets
were an absolute poem.

05:01.050 --> 05:04.512
The secret is:
baste it in its own fat.

05:09.267 --> 05:13.062
(gasps)
Ugh, they took everything.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.063
Huh?

05:14.147 --> 05:15.440
(party music plays)

05:15.523 --> 05:18.860
Hey! Check out
our new digs!

05:18.943 --> 05:20.570
Look at your
mom's tits!

05:20.653 --> 05:23.531
Ugh, I know
you're mad at me,
and I-I probably

05:23.614 --> 05:25.867
deserved it,
but I wanna help now!

05:25.950 --> 05:29.203
Can't hear you!
Partying too hard!

05:29.287 --> 05:30.204
Ugh!

05:30.288 --> 05:31.289
(guns cocking)

05:31.372 --> 05:32.582
Candy Smalls!

05:32.665 --> 05:35.668
You're under arrest
for Grand Theft Sled!

05:35.752 --> 05:38.212
You'll never catch me alive.
Serpentine fake out!

05:38.296 --> 05:40.465
The chase begins--
(grunts)

05:40.548 --> 05:42.050
And the chase ends.

05:42.133 --> 05:43.760
-(siren wails)
-(camera clicks)

05:43.843 --> 05:45.762
Wait, did I look
too guilty in that one?

05:45.845 --> 05:48.264
Okay... cavity check.

05:48.347 --> 05:50.099
Fine, but it's
a total waste of time.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.642
You know,
I may be a sugar fiend,

05:51.726 --> 05:54.812
but I am also
obsessed with flossing.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.856
You know, death creeps
in through the gums.

05:56.939 --> 05:58.232
(growls)

05:58.316 --> 06:00.693
Oh, you don't mean
that kind of cavity.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.653
Candy:
I should not be
locked up in here.

06:02.737 --> 06:03.821
Neither should I.

06:03.905 --> 06:06.449
All I wanna do is give
people happy endings.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.117
Hollywood loves 'em, Tra La La,

06:08.201 --> 06:09.827
but in real life,
it's a crime.

06:09.911 --> 06:12.413
-What're you in for, Hot Toddy?
-Breakin' and enterin'.

06:12.497 --> 06:15.708
Santa does it a million times
in one night, it's adorable.

06:15.792 --> 06:19.045
When I do it once
in my whole goddamn life,

06:19.128 --> 06:22.256
-I get locked up for years!
-Textbook double standard.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.801
There's so much
corruption and hypocrisy.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.845
Things have to change.
But... but how?

06:27.929 --> 06:30.932
What do you mean "how"?
Shake some shit up.

06:31.015 --> 06:33.434
Start a revolution,
sister!

06:33.518 --> 06:37.647
A revolution? Me?
Oh, really?
Oh, that's nuts.

06:37.730 --> 06:40.441
I don't like
that phrase!

06:40.525 --> 06:43.027
Sorry, my first
love was a chestnut.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.238
Smartest woman I ever knew.

06:45.321 --> 06:48.908
Until she roasted herself
over that open fire.

06:48.991 --> 06:50.451
You remind me of her.

06:50.535 --> 06:52.203
The, the pre-roasting
part, I mean.

06:52.286 --> 06:54.497
I do?
But, no, I'm the biggest

06:54.580 --> 06:56.541
laughingstock
in the North Pole.

06:56.624 --> 06:58.000
I'm not the next Santa.

06:58.084 --> 07:00.628
I'm just a highly
intelligent nobody.

07:00.711 --> 07:01.921
Listen to me, Candy.

07:02.004 --> 07:03.589
You're a coal miner's daughter

07:03.673 --> 07:06.592
who got to the top
of the ladder at Santa Inc.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.719
All of us girls
in the women's clink

07:08.803 --> 07:11.597
-were rootin' for you
to be Santa.
-It's true!

07:11.681 --> 07:14.350
We all went on a hunger strike
when Santa chose Devin.

07:14.433 --> 07:16.352
-You did?!
-We sure as hell did!

07:16.435 --> 07:19.689
Until they broke us
with some rigatoni Bolognese.

07:19.772 --> 07:21.232
(softly):
So damn delicious...

07:21.315 --> 07:24.735
Anyway, Candy, you'll figure out
how to start the revolution,

07:24.819 --> 07:27.029
and change this shitty place.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.991
And when you do, send me
a pound cake with a file in it.

07:30.074 --> 07:32.243
Thanks for believing
in me, you guys.

07:32.326 --> 07:33.953
It feels good, really.

07:34.036 --> 07:38.916
But I'm currently incarcerated,
so I can't do anything.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.627
Candy Smalls!
You have a visitor.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.629
Biscuit! Wow!
Oh my god, you guys,

07:43.713 --> 07:46.048
Biscuit is my best friend's
cousin from England.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.634
She's like a super
high-powered lawyer.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.928
I'm sorry.
Barrister.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.221
Did Cookie
bail me out?!

07:52.305 --> 07:55.099
Dear me.
Unfortunately, no.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.602
My cousin is still
extremely pissed with you

07:57.685 --> 07:59.896
for quote,
"being a dick," unquote.

07:59.979 --> 08:02.565
Your bail came
from an anonymous
Super PAC.

08:02.648 --> 08:05.401
Now let's get out
of this shit box.

08:05.484 --> 08:08.779
-Help the cause, Candy!
-Fight for us all!

08:08.863 --> 08:11.866
Goodbye, Hot Toddy.
Goodbye, Tra La La.

08:11.949 --> 08:13.784
You haven't heard
the last of me,

08:13.868 --> 08:16.078
-I promise!
-Yes! You got this!

08:16.162 --> 08:17.997
-Come on, Candy! You go, girl!
-Don't forget about the cake,

08:18.080 --> 08:19.665
and if you can make
it a pound cake--

08:19.749 --> 08:21.083
-Reporter 1:
Candy, what's the story?
-Reporter 2: Candy...

08:21.167 --> 08:23.002
-(reporters shouting)
-Santa!

08:23.085 --> 08:25.296
-Candy--
-Please don't speak
to my client.

08:25.379 --> 08:28.299
Ugh, I've decided
I am not going
to press charges

08:28.382 --> 08:33.262
because of my gigantic
and incredibly cool heart!

08:33.346 --> 08:36.140
Uh, and also,
you know what, you're fired,
you fuckin' wise-ass.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.892
Uh,‘cause you told me
to "go fuck myself,"

08:37.975 --> 08:40.603
which I'm totally over,
never hurt in the first place,

08:40.686 --> 08:42.438
-but still, fuck you.
-Pff! No biggie.

08:42.521 --> 08:45.441
I was just about to quit,
so it doesn't count as
being fired anyway.

08:45.524 --> 08:47.068
But ha ha,
you didn't quit,

08:47.151 --> 08:49.946
so, uh, you're fired.
I win. Fuck you.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.447
You're fired as fuck,
motherfucker.

08:51.530 --> 08:52.782
Fine, I'm free.

08:52.865 --> 08:55.117
I'd rather be an unpaid
intern at Passover

08:55.201 --> 08:57.119
then work for your
stupid company.

08:57.203 --> 09:00.122
Great, go have
some roaring haroset,
and get lost.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.124
Good, I love haroset.
I love the combination

09:02.208 --> 09:03.626
of flavors.
It's delicious.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.461
Stop squeezing my hand so hard.

09:05.544 --> 09:07.088
Wait, is that morse code?

09:07.171 --> 09:08.798
Are you squeezing,
"Go fuck yourself"?

09:08.881 --> 09:10.800
Why, yes, I am,
and no one knows it,

09:10.883 --> 09:13.844
which is cool as shit.
So, guess what? I win!

09:13.928 --> 09:15.721
Ugh, I--
You know what,
show's over.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.223
Thank you
for coming,
everyone!

09:17.306 --> 09:19.141
Goddammit,
it stings every time.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.351
Gosh,
that was easy money.

09:20.434 --> 09:22.478
Sorry about your job,
but what're you doing now?

09:22.562 --> 09:25.147
I gotta clean out my office,
and steal some office supplies

09:25.231 --> 09:27.650
because no matter how
alone I am in this fight,

09:27.733 --> 09:31.112
my revolution
will be collated.

09:33.572 --> 09:35.950
-(Candy gasps)
-Candy, I'm so sorry.

09:36.033 --> 09:38.452
My dream was
that Santa and I
would one day

09:38.536 --> 09:40.788
do a classic rock
karaoke duet.

09:40.871 --> 09:43.874
Not that he'd make
me the next Santa!
That was your dream.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.876
Stop.
It's, It's not
your fault.

09:45.960 --> 09:49.839
It was your beard,
and your gut,
and your dick.

09:49.922 --> 09:52.675
And your college,
and your frat choice,

09:52.758 --> 09:55.511
and your-- I guess,
your personality.

09:55.594 --> 09:59.015
Hey, I was just...
looking for Devin.

09:59.098 --> 10:01.642
Goldie, you're
looking well.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.853
Candace Ellen Smalls.

10:03.936 --> 10:05.521
Awkward!

10:05.604 --> 10:08.316
Ooh, guys.
Who's gonna talk?
Who's gonna talk next?

10:08.399 --> 10:10.192
I-I'm sorry.
I was a bitch.

10:10.276 --> 10:13.112
But I, I thought that
if you were my true bitch

10:13.195 --> 10:15.948
that you wouldn't
bitch about me
being such a bitch.

10:16.032 --> 10:21.245
But I was being
a little bitch,
and I apologize.

10:21.329 --> 10:24.832
I'm so sorry,
and I, I love you.

10:26.584 --> 10:30.463
-Oh.
-Aw, this is sweet.

10:30.546 --> 10:32.131
And you know what's
kinda weird-a-roo

10:32.214 --> 10:36.052
in like a super cosmic
fate-y kinda way?

10:36.135 --> 10:38.220
I would never
have even been
on Santa's radar

10:38.304 --> 10:40.306
if it hadn't been
for what Goldie
told me to do.

10:40.389 --> 10:43.267
Goldie?! You told Devin
to go for Successor?

10:43.351 --> 10:45.853
Even though you knew
it was my dream?

10:45.936 --> 10:47.730
You know what, you have
always been jealous of me

10:47.813 --> 10:50.983
-because I accomplish things
while you're stuck on the bench!
-No!

10:51.067 --> 10:52.610
Devin, why're
you saying that?

10:52.693 --> 10:54.570
Well, in a way,
you did, babe.

10:54.653 --> 10:56.572
You told me you wanted
a partner with a career,

10:56.655 --> 10:58.240
so I got all ambitious.

10:58.324 --> 11:01.327
Oh, she inspired you, oopsie.

11:01.410 --> 11:05.164
That's on me. I'm good now.
Phew! False-o alarm-o.

11:05.247 --> 11:07.708
Nope, because now
I am fucking pissed!

11:07.792 --> 11:10.753
You think I'd hurt
you like that because
I'm jealous of you?!

11:10.836 --> 11:14.423
I was happy when
I heard Devin was gonna
be Santa instead of you.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.550
Wow, really nice.
That is so fucked!

11:16.634 --> 11:20.012
I thought everything
would go back to normal,
and I'd get my friend back,

11:20.096 --> 11:22.681
but I'd rather sit on that
bench for a thousand years

11:22.765 --> 11:25.184
before sitting in this room
with you for one more second.

11:25.267 --> 11:28.312
I-- You--
We're not
even sitting!

11:28.396 --> 11:30.481
And, god,
we shouldn't even
be fighting!

11:30.564 --> 11:33.984
We're all just collateral damage
in a much bigger conspiracy.

11:34.068 --> 11:36.946
Conspiracy?
Do you realize
how nuts you sound?

11:37.029 --> 11:39.073
Girl fights
are so weird.

11:39.156 --> 11:41.826
The Igma Loo bros
would just smash
my face into a door,

11:41.909 --> 11:43.202
and all would
be forgiven.

11:43.285 --> 11:44.578
Simple and civilized.

11:44.662 --> 11:45.621
Goldie/Candy:
Shut up, Devin!

11:45.704 --> 11:48.082
-Shut up, Candy!
-You shut up, Goldie!

11:48.165 --> 11:51.085
Ugh, I need
a fucking drink.

11:51.168 --> 11:52.795
I feel like
this is my fault.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.463
Candy:
Yeah, it is,
dumb fuck!

11:54.547 --> 11:55.548
Oops.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.135
Mrs. Claus:
Hey.

11:59.218 --> 12:01.011
Mm, dammit,
you're sexy.

12:01.095 --> 12:06.142
The last time
Santa told me that was
in 1969 at Spruce Stock,

12:06.225 --> 12:08.644
when "Blowing In The Snow"
was playing.

12:11.981 --> 12:14.191
Holy mother
of May and December.

12:14.275 --> 12:18.154
Ah! James, you can turn
around right this instant.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.822
If Santa wants
to talk to me,

12:19.905 --> 12:21.449
he can drag
his butt here himself.

12:21.532 --> 12:26.203
This is not about Santa.
It's about... this!

12:26.287 --> 12:29.999
Uh, no idea what that means,
but it seems private.

12:30.082 --> 12:33.586
I acted out
because I felt
trapped in my life.

12:33.669 --> 12:36.338
A little...
Claus-trophobic?

12:36.422 --> 12:37.548
Yes!

12:37.631 --> 12:40.050
I could kick
myself for never
thinking of that.

12:40.134 --> 12:42.219
I felt so
sheltered
and useless.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.805
I wanted to feel like
a young girl again.

12:44.889 --> 12:47.933
-A young girl who sold hair?
-(Mrs. Claus sighs)

12:48.017 --> 12:50.311
My father,
Leonard Senior,
was a barber,

12:50.394 --> 12:53.564
and every night we'd peddle
the day's shavings to the poor

12:53.647 --> 12:58.694
for them to use for pillow
and mattress stuffings,
and hair dolls.

12:58.777 --> 13:03.032
I came from nothing,
and then, grew up
to have everything,

13:03.115 --> 13:05.993
and still feel like
I wasted my life.

Dave-Pierre! Dave-Pierre!
Hello? I need some advice.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.969
How do I make big changes to--

13:24.053 --> 13:26.555
Hey... Huh?

13:26.639 --> 13:28.432
-What the hell?
-I left Santa

13:28.516 --> 13:29.892
because he's the worst,

13:29.975 --> 13:31.852
and I moved in
with Dave-Pierre,

13:31.936 --> 13:34.230
and I have no regrets.
(chuckles)

13:34.313 --> 13:37.608
This man's tongue was built
for giving women orgasms.

13:37.691 --> 13:40.110
-(Mrs. Claus laughs)
-What can I say,
I've been blessed.

13:40.194 --> 13:44.073
And I came here
as a safe haven to vent
about how much Santa sucks.

13:44.156 --> 13:47.493
Oh my god.
Is this anger because he
didn't pick me as Successor?

13:47.576 --> 13:49.828
You guys,
I'm moved!

13:49.912 --> 13:51.413
That is not
the whole story.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.332
Don't you dare
be moved by me!

13:53.415 --> 13:54.792
Well, Jingle Jim,
I do dare.

13:54.875 --> 13:57.753
And guess what?
I have a plan to take
that fucker down.

13:57.836 --> 14:00.589
I am going to start
a revolution of one.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.341
My allies may despise me,

14:02.424 --> 14:04.677
but I alone can
single-handedly fix

14:04.760 --> 14:07.263
this deceptively
adorable empire!

14:08.597 --> 14:10.432
Uh... clap now.

14:10.516 --> 14:13.602
Oh, Candy, this is
exactly what tripped
you up with Successor.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.312
You thought
you could do it
all by yourself.

14:15.396 --> 14:17.398
You can't make this
kind of change alone.

14:17.481 --> 14:20.025
You need us.
And everyone.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.403
All of the workers
oppressed by Santa Inc.

14:22.486 --> 14:24.405
As much as it pains
me to be nice to you,

14:24.488 --> 14:26.448
you're the person
to lead it, Candy.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.617
People rooted for you
to be the next Santa.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.287
Despite that annoying,
high-pitched voice of yours,

14:31.370 --> 14:33.747
-I believe they'll
listen to you.
-No, they won't!

14:33.831 --> 14:36.375
I was an asshole,
and everyone despises me.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.335
What could ever change that?

14:38.419 --> 14:41.255
-You could apologize to them.
-He's right!

14:41.338 --> 14:43.340
Women are always
apologizing.

14:43.424 --> 14:44.633
You should be
good at that!

14:44.717 --> 14:47.136
Yeah, well, it's not
that easy, Mrs. Claus.

14:47.219 --> 14:51.098
-I mean, I tried with Goldie.
It just made it worse.
-Try harder.

14:51.181 --> 14:53.434
Jesus, this new
Mrs. Claus is pushy.

14:53.517 --> 14:56.145
But, yeah,
let's do this!
Together!

14:56.228 --> 14:57.479
(all cheering)

14:57.563 --> 14:58.981
(crying)

14:59.064 --> 15:01.650
I'm sorry.
You know, I did things

15:01.734 --> 15:04.528
I never thought I would do
to become the next Santa.

15:04.612 --> 15:07.156
I keep thinking about
the South Pole trip.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.408
You know, how happy
I was when everyone said

15:09.491 --> 15:10.659
I was "one of the guys."

15:10.743 --> 15:12.703
It was so weird
and off-brand,

15:12.786 --> 15:14.330
but I didn't
wanna say anything.

15:14.413 --> 15:15.664
You were so psyched.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.916
So, I just talked shit
about you with Goldie later.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.294
All I want now is
to be one of the girls.

15:20.377 --> 15:22.504
-Too bad Goldie still hates me.
-I know.

15:22.588 --> 15:25.007
I heard about your fight.
It sounds ugly,

15:25.090 --> 15:27.635
but I've been going
through a lot myself.

15:27.718 --> 15:30.387
Tomorrow, I'm quitting
my job at the factory.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.014
But this is what
you always wanted,

15:32.097 --> 15:35.851
a baby, a husband, a career,
a, a premature ham--

15:35.934 --> 15:38.854
You have a career,
or... had one.

15:38.937 --> 15:42.149
I stare into space,
stirring a bunch
of melted sugar.

15:42.232 --> 15:44.735
When Fun Size tried
to assassinate his babysitter,

15:44.818 --> 15:48.238
I realized he's not happy,
and neither am I.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.823
I missed his first steps.

15:49.907 --> 15:52.368
Is it really worth missing
my kid's whole childhood?

15:52.451 --> 15:54.703
Ah, it sounds like
the right move.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.955
But can you hold on
a little longer?

15:57.039 --> 15:58.916
I, I need your help.

15:58.999 --> 16:01.293
Ooh, you know how
I love being needed.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.670
What is going on?

16:02.753 --> 16:05.047
I can't get into it,
but do me a favor,

16:05.130 --> 16:06.965
and bring the factory
women to a meeting.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.092
It's on Thanksgiving.

16:08.175 --> 16:09.259
I don't know, Candy.

16:09.343 --> 16:10.886
I wanna be home
for the holidays.

16:10.969 --> 16:12.513
I already promised
Craig I'd hang out

16:12.596 --> 16:15.432
while he made a dry turkey
for his horrible family.

16:15.516 --> 16:17.851
Did I tell you
his sister's dating
an ornament?

16:17.935 --> 16:19.728
Everyone's freaking
out about it.

16:19.812 --> 16:23.190
I get it. I do.
But just please
think about it.

16:23.273 --> 16:26.527
It's not just about me
and my ego this time,
I promise.

16:26.610 --> 16:30.406
So, I wanted to apologize
for how I, uh...

16:30.489 --> 16:34.243
manipulated the situation
at the golf course.

16:34.326 --> 16:37.621
I'm, uh,
sorry, Junior.

16:37.705 --> 16:39.206
Oh, Candy.

16:39.289 --> 16:41.458
If you thought coming here
and apologizing to me

16:41.542 --> 16:45.754
would mean I'd stop being
a rude asshole to you,
you're wrong.

16:45.838 --> 16:50.759
Now I'm going
to be a rude, vengeful
asshole, Tiny Brain.

16:50.843 --> 16:51.969
What's that supposed to mean?

16:52.052 --> 16:55.180
"Duh... what's
'Tiny Brain' mean?"

16:55.264 --> 16:59.143
Elves have tiny brains,
and lady elves have the tiniest.

16:59.226 --> 17:02.062
I used to know
your mother,
so I know.

17:02.146 --> 17:03.689
You did?
I, I had no idea--

17:03.772 --> 17:06.942
All women are whores,
and all elves are trash,

17:07.025 --> 17:09.278
and all women elves
are trashy whores.

17:09.361 --> 17:13.323
So, I do not
accept your apology,
you trashy whore elf!

17:13.407 --> 17:16.160
-(Junior grunts)
-Wow, that guy is fucked up.

17:16.243 --> 17:18.746
Look, I know we've had
a complicated relationship,

17:18.829 --> 17:21.081
and I-I'm sorry
I betrayed you all.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.041
Come on, Candy.

17:23.125 --> 17:24.376
I'm rich.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.629
I don't give two shits
about anything anymore.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.173
Mom, do you forgive me?

17:29.256 --> 17:30.299
I will...

17:30.382 --> 17:32.176
when you call all
the Board members,

17:32.259 --> 17:34.845
and recommend me as a mistress.

17:34.928 --> 17:37.181
Here's some talking points.

17:37.264 --> 17:39.808
"My mom never met
a shaft she couldn't crank,

17:39.892 --> 17:44.980
but, beware, Big Candy
may cause extreme horniness."

17:45.063 --> 17:47.858
-Fine. Tony?
-I might be covered
in bling, yeah,

17:47.941 --> 17:50.527
but I still feel like
shit because of you.

17:50.611 --> 17:53.530
Why didn't anyone tell us
money doesn't bring happiness?

17:53.614 --> 17:55.866
I feel like it's a pretty
common thing you hear a lot.

17:55.949 --> 17:57.826
I don't care.
It sucks!

17:57.910 --> 18:00.245
There's only one thing
I want from you, Candy,

18:00.329 --> 18:03.957
and only then will
we be cool again.

18:47.584 --> 18:50.462
It's taken 20 years,
but I'm glad we cleared the air.

18:51.421 --> 18:54.007
-(flatulence)
-(all laughing)

18:54.091 --> 18:55.717
Santa:
Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.

18:55.801 --> 18:56.844
Glad you could
make it, Almonds.

18:56.927 --> 18:58.387
I feel like
I need some counsel.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.556
You know,
I, I hope I didn't take
you away from your family.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.474
Well, my quadruplets
are only nine months.

19:02.558 --> 19:04.434
They'll retain no memory
of the abandonment,

19:04.518 --> 19:07.229
and my husband
is a sociopath.
He feels nothing.

19:07.312 --> 19:08.897
In other words,
all good!

19:08.981 --> 19:11.066
Do you think
I've changed
over the years?

19:11.149 --> 19:13.360
Have I stopped caring
about what's important?

19:13.443 --> 19:15.863
Santa,
you're fuckin' fine.
Women suck.

19:15.946 --> 19:18.115
Candy sucks,
your wife sucks.

19:18.198 --> 19:19.950
My mother was a fuckin' monster.

19:20.033 --> 19:22.578
She told me my nose made me
look like a fuckin' freak,

19:22.661 --> 19:24.746
and made me paint it
with nail polish to hide it!

19:24.830 --> 19:28.208
The only woman who
I thought was cool
was a tiny-brained elf

19:28.292 --> 19:31.920
I loved who rejected me
for a coal miner!

19:32.004 --> 19:34.298
Me?! I fuck
human models!

19:34.381 --> 19:37.926
Are you talking about Big Candy?
She was the love of your life?!

19:38.010 --> 19:41.179
Wow, Sherlock Holmes
just crashed our dinner.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.514
Now fuck off, B-Team.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.308
Oh, god.
Junior sucks.

19:44.391 --> 19:45.893
This is turning
into the creepiest

19:45.976 --> 19:47.269
Thanksgiving
of my life.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.021
I'll take care of this.

19:49.104 --> 19:50.939
So, uh...
ding, ding, ding.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.108
I'd like to make
a holiday toast.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.736
Uh, in the immortal words
of my fourth-grade teacher,

19:55.819 --> 19:59.239
Mr. Joopy, who was later
arrested for dating a student,

19:59.323 --> 20:02.117
"If no one else will let
you sit at their lunch table,

20:02.201 --> 20:03.744
there's always room at mine."

20:03.827 --> 20:05.871
Hey, hey did you see
my new barracuda fish?

20:05.954 --> 20:08.206
The Board got them for me
as a Successor pick bonus.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.167
They glow
in the dark
all the time.

20:10.250 --> 20:13.295
It's like watching
a bunch of cell phones
float around in a tank.

20:15.380 --> 20:18.300
(mischievous music plays)

20:27.601 --> 20:30.312
(indistinct chatter)

20:31.855 --> 20:34.900
Uh, hi, hey.
Can I have everyone's attention?

20:37.569 --> 20:38.487
(coughs)

20:42.783 --> 20:44.618
Hi! Keep talking, keep talking.

20:45.827 --> 20:48.830
Friends, co-workers, and family,

20:48.914 --> 20:51.250
thank you so much
for being here.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.210
I'm gonna say this
plain and simple,

20:53.293 --> 20:57.339
we are all sick of the shit
that goes on at Santa Inc.

20:57.422 --> 21:00.217
So, let's change things!
Who's with me?

21:00.300 --> 21:03.011
I've been forced
to sit my partridge ass

21:03.095 --> 21:05.847
in this goddamn
pear tree for 20 years

21:05.931 --> 21:07.933
with a debilitating
pear allergy

21:08.016 --> 21:10.269
just because
of some stupid song!

21:10.352 --> 21:13.730
Are you aware of what sores
looks like on a partridge?!

21:13.814 --> 21:16.358
Because they do not
look like regular sores!

21:16.441 --> 21:20.112
-They look like... this!
-Oh my god, my eye holes!

21:20.195 --> 21:23.657
I complained to all
the department heads,
but no one ever cared!

21:23.740 --> 21:27.536
Every time I pick mistletoe,
I get sexually assaulted.

21:27.619 --> 21:29.663
Turtle doves are being
replaced with tortoise doves,

21:29.746 --> 21:32.207
and no one says anything!
What are you gonna do?

21:32.290 --> 21:34.126
Listen, listen!

21:34.209 --> 21:35.669
I have a plan,

21:35.752 --> 21:40.048
and it is going
to blow your minds.

21:40.132 --> 21:44.720
(all cheering)

21:46.221 --> 21:49.307
(light music playing)

21:56.273 --> 22:01.403
♪ If there is nothing
under the tree ♪

22:01.486 --> 22:08.326
♪ Don't be sad,
you'll always have me ♪

22:09.327 --> 22:13.290
♪ Me, me, me, me ♪

22:16.209 --> 22:19.296
(guitar riffs)

22:33.852 --> 22:40.734
♪ Don't be sad,
you'll always have me ♪

22:40.817 --> 22:42.778
Y-You'll always have me.
