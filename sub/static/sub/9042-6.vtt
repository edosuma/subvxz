WEBVTT

00:01.367 --> 00:02.900
- HEY.
- HEY, ROBERT.

00:02.900 --> 00:04.133
- HEY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:04.133 --> 00:05.767
- OH, NOTHING.

00:05.767 --> 00:08.033
JUST THOUGHT I'D COME BY,
SEE WHAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING.

00:08.033 --> 00:09.400
- OH, WE'RE GOING TO THE MOVIES.

00:09.400 --> 00:10.533
- OH.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.133
- YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT,
YOU CAN COME.

00:16.133 --> 00:18.433
- NO, NO.
THAT'S OKAY.

00:21.967 --> 00:24.167
- NO, YEAH.
I MEAN, COME. COME.

00:24.167 --> 00:25.400
WE WERE GONNA GO AS A COUPLE,

00:25.400 --> 00:27.667
BUT YOU CAN RUIN IT IF YOU WANT.

00:29.600 --> 00:32.300
- WELL, THAT'S SWEET OF YOU,
BUT NO, NO.

00:32.300 --> 00:33.900
- OH, COME ON, ROBERT.
COME WITH US, HUH?

00:33.900 --> 00:36.200
YOU CAN CALL SOMEBODY,
AND WE'LL MAKE IT A DOUBLE DATE.

00:36.200 --> 00:37.433
- WELL, BY THE TIME
HE GETS A DATE,

00:37.433 --> 00:40.400
THE MOVIE'LL BE ON VIDEO.

00:44.667 --> 00:47.767
- ACTUALLY, MOVIES REALLY AREN'T
IN MY BUDGET RIGHT NOW.

00:47.767 --> 00:50.367
- REALLY?
- BUDGET?

00:50.367 --> 00:53.300
WHAT, THE NEW GIANT TAX
KICK IN?

00:59.667 --> 01:01.267
- IF YOU MUST KNOW,

01:01.267 --> 01:03.167
THEY'RE MAKING A LOT OF PAY CUTS
AT THE PRECINCT.

01:03.167 --> 01:04.633
THEY'RE CUTTING BACK
ON THE HOURS,

01:04.633 --> 01:07.433
AND PEOPLE ARE JUST SCRAMBLING
TO MAKE ENDS MEET.

01:07.433 --> 01:10.567
- OH, ROBERT, I HAD NO IDEA.
WHY THE CUTBACKS?

01:10.567 --> 01:12.733
- UH, CRIME'S AT A 30-YEAR LOW.

01:15.467 --> 01:18.467
IT'S TOUGH ON EVERYBODY.

01:18.467 --> 01:21.267
AND THE GUYS--THEY'RE HAVING TO
TAKE SECOND JOBS,

01:21.267 --> 01:23.233
PEOPLE ARE DIPPING
INTO THEIR RETIREMENT FUNDS.

01:23.233 --> 01:25.500
IT'S ROUGH OUT THERE.

01:25.500 --> 01:28.600
SO I HAD TO CANCEL
MY CABLE,

01:28.600 --> 01:30.700
BUT, UH, THOUGHT MAYBE
I CAN COME OVER HERE

01:30.700 --> 01:32.867
AND WATCH A MOVIE
ON YOUR SATELLITE.

01:32.867 --> 01:35.167
- YOU CANCELED CABLE?

01:37.100 --> 01:38.433
- OH, YEAH,
BUT THAT'S OKAY.

01:38.433 --> 01:40.000
YOU KNOW,
I GOT TO SHIFT MY FOCUS,

01:40.000 --> 01:42.133
REEVALUATE MY PRIORITIES.

01:42.133 --> 01:44.367
- COULDN'T KEEP BASIC CABLE?

01:45.767 --> 01:47.700
- I'M DOING WHAT NEEDS
TO BE DONE, RAYMOND,

01:47.700 --> 01:49.433
ACROSS THE BOARD.

01:49.433 --> 01:52.233
YOU KNOW, YOU'D BE SURPRISED
HOW INEXPENSIVE AND VERSATILE

01:52.233 --> 01:54.000
BOLOGNA IS.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.467
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

01:55.467 --> 01:58.133
- BOLOGNA. IT'S GREAT.

01:58.133 --> 02:00.367
I MADE IT IN CASSEROLES,
STEW, SALAD.

02:00.367 --> 02:02.133
I EVEN PUT IT INTO A PIE.

02:03.733 --> 02:05.133
- HOW WAS THAT?

02:05.133 --> 02:06.733
- NOT TOO GOOD.

02:10.833 --> 02:13.600
- ROBERT, I'M A LITTLE
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.600
- NO, NO, I'M FINE.
I'M A GROWNUP.

02:15.600 --> 02:19.100
- WELL, HERE.
MOMMY MADE SOME COOKIES.

02:19.100 --> 02:21.200
- HUH. THANKS.
WELL, YOU GUYS GO AHEAD.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.600
YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.467
- ALL RIGHT, COME ON.
LET'S GO.

02:25.467 --> 02:28.400
NOW THAT I DON'T HAVE COOKIES,
I GOT TO GET GOOBERS.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.000
- RAY, WHAT ABOUT ROBERT?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.167
- WELL...

02:46.433 --> 02:50.433
WELL...WELL, HE'S COMING OFF
BOLOGNA PIE.

02:54.267 --> 02:55.567
- WE NEED TO HELP HIM.

02:55.567 --> 02:57.500
- WH-WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
LIKE MILK?

03:04.267 --> 03:07.167
- MONEY. HE NEEDS MONEY.
WEREN'T YOU LISTENING?

03:07.167 --> 03:09.400
- YEAH. HE DIDN'T
ASK FOR MONEY.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.000
- BECAUSE HE'S
TOO PROUD TO ASK.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.667
- WELL, IT'S A GOOD SYSTEM.

03:15.367 --> 03:18.600
HE KEEPS HIS PRIDE.
WE KEEP OUR MONEY.

03:18.600 --> 03:21.200
- RAY, WE ARE IN PRETTY GOOD
SHAPE FINANCIALLY, OKAY?

03:21.200 --> 03:22.700
I WOULD NEVER BRING IT UP

03:22.700 --> 03:24.500
IF I DIDN'T THINK
WE COULD AFFORD TO HELP HIM.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.700
I MEAN, HE CAN'T EVEN
GO TO THE MOVIES.

03:26.700 --> 03:28.467
- NEITHER CAN I!

03:30.167 --> 03:31.567
- I SAY WE GIVE HIM
SOME MONEY.

03:31.567 --> 03:34.333
- WELL, YOU'RE ALWAYS
SAYING THINGS.

03:34.333 --> 03:36.000
- ALL RIGHT, THEN, A LOAN.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.633
- COME ON, HE'S FINE.

03:37.633 --> 03:40.100
- RAY, LOOK AT HIM.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.633
- [sighs]

03:56.533 --> 03:59.333
- I'M SO GLAD
WE'RE DOING THIS.

03:59.333 --> 04:01.067
- WHOA, WHOA. WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

04:01.067 --> 04:02.167
HOW MUCH WE GONNA GIVE HIM?

04:02.167 --> 04:04.100
- LIKE...$1,000.

04:04.100 --> 04:05.267
- A THOUSAND--
- SHH.

04:08.333 --> 04:11.600
- [muffled] $1,000?

04:11.600 --> 04:14.233
- IT HAS TO BE ENOUGH
TO HELP HIM, RAY.

04:14.233 --> 04:18.133
- WELL, ALL RIGHT, HELP HIM,
BUT $1,000.

04:18.133 --> 04:21.433
WHAT ABOUT THAT THING:
TEACH A MAN TO FISH

04:21.433 --> 04:24.700
SO HE DOESN'T TAKE
YOUR $1,000?

04:29.967 --> 04:31.500
- HIS BILLS ARE PILING UP.

04:31.500 --> 04:33.200
THIS WILL GET HIM
OUT FROM UNDER THEM.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.967
WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

04:34.967 --> 04:38.700
- IT'S JUST...
I LIKE $1,000.

04:40.100 --> 04:43.667
- RAY, HE'S YOUR BROTHER.

04:45.033 --> 04:47.300
- [exhales sharply]

04:50.100 --> 04:51.667
- ROBERT?

04:51.667 --> 04:54.333
- HEY. I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WERE GOING TO THE MOVIES.

04:54.333 --> 04:55.533
- I THOUGHT SO TOO.

04:57.733 --> 04:58.933
- RAY AND I WERE TALKING,

04:58.933 --> 05:00.400
AND WE WANT TO LEND YOU
SOME MONEY.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.967
- WHAT?

05:01.967 --> 05:04.333
- YEAH, IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT.

05:04.333 --> 05:07.567
OKAY?
HERE. JUST TAKE IT.

05:15.233 --> 05:17.767
- THIS IS $1,000.

05:17.767 --> 05:19.700
- YES.

05:23.333 --> 05:24.967
- THIS IS SO SWEET OF YOU.

05:24.967 --> 05:28.233
- OH, THAT'S OKAY, ROBERT.

05:28.233 --> 05:29.667
- I CAN'T TAKE THIS.

05:29.667 --> 05:31.367
- ALL RIGHT,
IF THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL.

05:31.367 --> 05:32.600
- RAY!

05:40.000 --> 05:42.067
LOOK, ROBERT,
IT'S OKAY.

05:42.067 --> 05:43.867
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S JUST A LOAN.

05:43.867 --> 05:45.067
- YEAH, BUT SEE,
THAT'S JUST IT.

05:45.067 --> 05:46.667
BECAUSE THE WAY THINGS ARE,

05:46.667 --> 05:48.933
I DON'T KNOW WHEN
I'LL BE ABLE TO PAY IT BACK.

05:48.933 --> 05:50.800
AND I CAN'T LIVE WITH THAT.

05:50.800 --> 05:52.633
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:52.633 --> 05:57.500
I'LL NEVER FORGET
THAT YOU OFFERED IT TO ME.

05:57.500 --> 06:00.267
THIS MEANS
SO MUCH TO ME.

06:12.967 --> 06:17.300
- HERE, TAKE IT.
IT'S A GIFT.

06:17.300 --> 06:18.733
- WE WANT YOU
TO HAVE IT, ROBERT,

06:18.733 --> 06:21.000
AND WE DON'T WANT YOU
TO WORRY ABOUT IT.

06:29.233 --> 06:31.400
- THANK YOU.

06:38.667 --> 06:41.000
- OKAY.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.467
- COME HERE.

06:51.467 --> 06:53.067
THIS REALLY HELPS, RAYMOND.

06:53.067 --> 06:56.467
- IT'S OKAY, ROBERT.

06:56.467 --> 06:58.600
[straining]
YOU'RE MY BROTHER!

07:04.400 --> 07:06.233
HEY, WE'RE HERE
TO PICK UP THE KIDS,

07:06.233 --> 07:08.533
UNLESS YOU WANT TO KEEP 'EM.

07:08.533 --> 07:10.467
- HERE, FRANK,
WE BROUGHT YOU SOME DONUTS.

07:10.467 --> 07:13.700
- YOUR KIDS WERE HERE
TWO DAYS IN A ROW.

07:13.700 --> 07:16.367
THERE BETTER BE
SOME ECLAIRS IN HERE.

07:16.367 --> 07:18.033
- SORRY, DAD.
I GUESS YOU DON'T WANT 'EM.

07:18.033 --> 07:20.100
- GET LOST.

07:20.100 --> 07:21.200
- HI, DEARS.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.333
- HEY, MARIE.
- HEY.

07:22.333 --> 07:24.067
- WHAT ARE THOSE, DONUTS?

07:24.067 --> 07:26.733
- GET LOST.

07:26.733 --> 07:28.867
- YOU BETTER SAVE ONE
FOR ROBBIE.

07:28.867 --> 07:30.100
HE'S COMING OVER.

07:30.100 --> 07:34.333
- OH, GREAT. MOPEY DICK.

07:34.333 --> 07:36.433
- HE'S IN A VERY GOOD MOOD NOW.

07:36.433 --> 07:38.367
HE'S NOT MOPEY DICK.

07:38.367 --> 07:41.867
HE SOUNDED SO HAPPY.

07:41.867 --> 07:43.467
WHAT'S GOING ON?

07:45.867 --> 07:47.600
- YEAH, WE DID A NICE THING.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.567
- HEY, IT'S A BOX OF DONUTS.
YOU'RE NOT MOTHER TERESA.

07:50.567 --> 07:54.333
- NO, DAD,
WE DID SOMETHING FOR ROBERT.

07:54.333 --> 07:55.767
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

07:55.767 --> 07:58.333
- HE JUST TOLD US THAT
HE'S BEEN GOING THROUGH

07:58.333 --> 08:00.067
A ROUGH PATCH FINANCIALLY,

08:00.067 --> 08:02.867
SO WE HELPED HIM OUT
A LITTLE.

08:02.867 --> 08:05.100
- YOU MEAN WITH MONEY?

08:06.900 --> 08:08.533
- YEAH.

08:08.533 --> 08:11.033
- HOW MUCH?

08:13.333 --> 08:15.500
- $1,000.
- [gasps]

08:15.500 --> 08:19.333
- WHAT ARE YOU TWO, IDIOTS?

08:19.333 --> 08:21.167
- NO, WE THOUGHT IT WAS
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.533
AND YOU HEARD MARIE.
HE'S FINALLY HAPPY.

08:23.533 --> 08:26.433
- WHY DIDN'T HE COME TO US
IF HE NEEDED MONEY?

08:26.433 --> 08:29.300
- BECAUSE WE'D SAY NO.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.867
- I'M HIS MOTHER.

08:30.867 --> 08:32.733
I'M THE ONE HE SHOULD COME TO
IF HE NEEDED MONEY.

08:32.733 --> 08:34.933
RAYMOND, I WANT TO
BUY OUT THAT LOAN.

08:34.933 --> 08:36.833
- NO! NO WAY!

08:36.833 --> 08:38.200
LENDING MONEY TO ROBERT

08:38.200 --> 08:40.200
IS THE STUPIDEST THING
I EVER HEARD.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.200
- IT WASN'T A LOAN.
IT WAS A GIFT.

08:42.200 --> 08:46.533
- I STAND CORRECTED.

08:49.333 --> 08:50.933
- WHY DON'T YOU SEE
HOW MANY DONUTS

08:50.933 --> 08:52.800
YOU CAN GET
IN YOUR MOUTH, DAD?

08:52.800 --> 08:56.400
- OH, THEY'RE ALL GOING IN.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.900
BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT GIVING MONEY.

08:58.900 --> 09:02.467
FIRST OF ALL, YOU NEVER
JUST OFFER IT TO ANYBODY.

09:02.467 --> 09:05.067
THEY GOT TO COME TO YOU
WITH A REALLY GOOD REASON

09:05.067 --> 09:07.767
AND A WHOLE PLAN
TO PAY YOU BACK.

09:07.767 --> 09:11.233
AND THEN, ONLY AFTER THEY'VE
PROVED THAT THEY'RE GOOD FOR IT,

09:11.233 --> 09:16.400
YOU TELL 'EM, BEAT IT, LOSER.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.167
- SO YOU JUST HUMILIATE THEM?

09:18.167 --> 09:20.367
- NO, THEY SHAME THEMSELVES.

09:20.367 --> 09:21.933
THEY LEARN A LESSON.

09:21.933 --> 09:23.367
AND IF THEY DON'T, SCREW THEM.

09:23.367 --> 09:26.400
WHO NEEDS FRIENDS LIKE THAT?

09:26.400 --> 09:28.700
- HEY, EVERYBODY!
HOW'S IT GOING?

09:28.700 --> 09:32.133
NICE TO SEE EVERYBODY.

09:32.133 --> 09:34.167
- OKAY, SEE?
HAPPY.

09:34.167 --> 09:35.600
- YEAH, IT'S NICE.

09:35.600 --> 09:38.567
- WHY WOULDN'T HE COME TO ME?

09:38.567 --> 09:40.500
- ALL RIGHTY.
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

09:40.500 --> 09:42.133
- HEY, WHERE YOU GOING?
- YEAH, ROBBIE.

09:42.133 --> 09:43.800
DO YOU WANT A DONUT?

09:43.800 --> 09:45.700
- OH, I'D LOVE TO, MA,
BUT THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS

09:45.700 --> 09:49.033
I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF
BEFORE I GO ON VACATION.

09:49.033 --> 09:50.100
- VACATION?

09:50.100 --> 09:54.100
- YEP, LAS VEGAS, NEVADA!

09:54.100 --> 09:56.667
OH! I NEED MY FLIP-FLOPS.

10:01.733 --> 10:04.600
- [laughs]

10:10.733 --> 10:14.200
- DID HE JUST SAY
HE'S GOING TO LAS VEGAS?

10:14.200 --> 10:17.167
- NEVADA!

10:20.067 --> 10:21.767
- ROBERT. ROBERT!

10:21.767 --> 10:23.067
- YEAH?

10:23.067 --> 10:25.667
- DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT?

10:27.367 --> 10:29.133
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

10:29.133 --> 10:30.700
- HEY. WHAT'S UP, BRO?

10:30.700 --> 10:32.667
- WELL, BRO...

10:32.667 --> 10:34.600
WORD HAS IT
YOU'RE GOING TO VEGAS.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.700
- YEP, I'M HOPPING ON
THE BIG, SILVER BIRD

10:36.700 --> 10:38.033
AT 8:45 TOMORROW.

10:38.033 --> 10:41.967
BY 1:45, THE EMPEROR'S BUFFET
AT CAESARS PALACE:

10:41.967 --> 10:46.067
SHRIMP, TACOS, WAFFLES,
AND TURKEY LEGS.

10:46.067 --> 10:47.667
- AND, HEY,
WHILE YOU'RE IN VEGAS,

10:47.667 --> 10:53.033
YOU CAN PICK UP RAY'S
"SUCKER OF THE YEAR" AWARD.

10:53.033 --> 10:54.500
- WAIT A MINUTE, ROBERT.

10:54.500 --> 10:57.400
ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN AFFORD
TO GO TO LAS VEGAS?

10:57.400 --> 11:01.067
- WELL, I CAN NOW,
THANKS TO YOU.

11:01.067 --> 11:03.733
- BUT YOU WERE EATING
BOLOGNA PIE!

11:03.733 --> 11:05.000
- [gasps]

11:05.000 --> 11:07.433
DEBRA, WHY WOULD
YOU MAKE THAT FOR HIM?

11:09.900 --> 11:11.633
- I DIDN'T MAKE IT.

11:11.633 --> 11:14.133
ROBERT WAS SAYING HE'S BEEN
EATING BOLOGNA IN EVERYTHING,

11:14.133 --> 11:15.667
BECAUSE HE HAS NO MONEY.

11:15.667 --> 11:17.567
- YEAH, WE THOUGHT YOU WOULD
USE THAT $1,000 TO--

11:17.567 --> 11:20.533
I DON'T KNOW--
KEEP YOURSELF ALIVE.

11:20.533 --> 11:22.533
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- WHAT DO I MEAN?

11:22.533 --> 11:24.600
WHAT ABOUT ALL YOUR PROBLEMS
AND YOUR BILLS?

11:24.600 --> 11:26.167
- YEAH, YOU SEE,
I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT,

11:26.167 --> 11:27.767
BUT THOSE THINGS'LL
ALWAYS BE THERE.

11:27.767 --> 11:32.033
WHEN ELSE AM I GONNA HAVE
AN EXTRA $1,000 TO GO TO VEGAS?

11:32.033 --> 11:35.800
- THAT WASN'T
AN EXTRA $1,000.

11:35.800 --> 11:37.700
- ROBERT, CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

11:37.700 --> 11:40.100
GOING TO LAS VEGAS
SEEMS A BIT EXTRAVAGANT

11:40.100 --> 11:41.767
FOR SOMEONE
IN YOUR POSITION.

11:41.767 --> 11:45.433
- WELL, MY POSITION IS EXTREMELY
STRESSED AND NEEDING A VACATION.

11:45.433 --> 11:47.200
- OH, IF YOU NEED
A VACATION, ROBBIE,

11:47.200 --> 11:48.833
YOU KNOW WHERE
I ALWAYS WANTED TO GO?

11:48.833 --> 11:51.567
HERSHEY, PENNSYLVANIA.

11:51.567 --> 11:54.033
WE COULD WATCH THEM
MAKE CHOCOLATE.

11:54.033 --> 11:57.600
- YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA WATCH.

11:57.600 --> 12:00.567
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

12:00.567 --> 12:02.533
- HOLD IT, ROBERT.

12:02.533 --> 12:04.100
YOU DON'T SEE ANYTHING WRONG

12:04.100 --> 12:05.600
WITH TAKING MY MONEY
AND GOING TO VEGAS?

12:05.600 --> 12:07.800
- YOU MEAN THE MONEY
I NEVER ASKED FOR

12:07.800 --> 12:09.100
THAT YOU GAVE ME
AS A GIFT?

12:09.100 --> 12:10.633
- OH, COME ON,
YOU CAME IN OUR HOUSE

12:10.633 --> 12:11.567
WITH A BIG CRYING ACT,

12:11.567 --> 12:13.733
AND THEN YOU ATE
ALL MY COOKIES.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.200
- CAN I JUST SAY SOMETHING?

12:15.200 --> 12:18.200
- NO, THE LAST THING YOU SAID
COST ME $1,000.

12:23.900 --> 12:27.733
I DIDN'T GIVE YOU THAT MONEY
SO YOU COULD GO TO VEGAS.

12:27.733 --> 12:31.167
- OH, I'M SORRY I DIDN'T READ
THE SMALL PRINT ON THE CHECK.

12:31.167 --> 12:34.100
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT YOUR GIFTS
CAME WITH RULES ATTACHED.

12:34.100 --> 12:35.633
"HERE'S THE MONEY,

12:35.633 --> 12:37.667
AND HERE'S A LIST OF THINGS
YOU CAN DO WITH IT."

12:37.667 --> 12:38.933
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

12:38.933 --> 12:40.200
- I MEAN,
IF YOU GAVE ME A CHAIR,

12:40.200 --> 12:41.500
WOULD YOU TELL ME
HOW TO SIT IN IT?

12:41.500 --> 12:44.000
"HERE, ROBERT.
I GAVE YOU THIS CHAIR.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.900
DON'T SIT LIKE THIS.
SIT LIKE THIS!"

12:47.900 --> 12:51.000
- NOW, ROBERT...

12:54.767 --> 12:58.833
- I GAVE YOU THAT MONEY,
AND YOU HUGGED ME.

12:58.833 --> 13:00.733
AND I LET YOU HUG ME.

13:00.733 --> 13:02.500
AND I SAID,
"YOU'RE MY BROTHER."

13:04.733 --> 13:10.067
YOU TAKE THAT MONEY
AND YOU GO TO VEGAS WITH IT,

13:10.067 --> 13:12.567
YOU'RE NOT MY BROTHER.

13:16.600 --> 13:19.000
- OH, REALLY?

13:32.733 --> 13:34.467
- YOU KNOW...

13:34.467 --> 13:38.233
I ONCE LOST A FRIEND OVER $50.

13:38.233 --> 13:40.567
AND I'LL TELL YA,

13:40.567 --> 13:43.567
SOMETIMES, WHEN I'M DRIVING,

13:43.567 --> 13:46.400
I STILL THINK
ABOUT THAT $50.

14:37.500 --> 14:38.667
[knock on door]

14:38.667 --> 14:40.900
- COME IN!

14:40.900 --> 14:43.300
GET OUT!

14:45.000 --> 14:47.567
- CAN I TALK TO YOU?

14:49.667 --> 14:53.700
LOOK, I MIGHT'VE SAID
SOME THINGS BACK THERE

14:53.700 --> 14:56.133
THAT I PROBABLY
SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID.

14:56.133 --> 14:59.333
- IT'S FINE, RAYMOND.

15:12.367 --> 15:16.333
- YOU LIKE THAT FLAVOR COMBO?

15:17.500 --> 15:18.733
- YES, I DO.

15:18.733 --> 15:22.233
AND I'M GONNA
SAVE SOME FOR LATER.

15:22.233 --> 15:25.600
- I'M SORRY, ALL RIGHT?

15:25.600 --> 15:28.400
I GUESS I REACTED BADLY,
BECAUSE, I DON'T KNOW,

15:28.400 --> 15:31.100
I WAS KIND OF SHOCKED.

15:31.100 --> 15:33.233
I DIDN'T MEAN TO IMPLY
THAT YOU'RE NOT MY BROTHER

15:33.233 --> 15:37.133
OR THAT I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE MY BROTHER.

15:37.133 --> 15:41.533
YOU'RE MY BROTHER, OKAY?

15:41.533 --> 15:43.933
- THANK YOU, RAYMOND.
THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

15:43.933 --> 15:46.700
I THINK I UNDERSTAND NOW
WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM.

15:46.700 --> 15:49.800
- GOOD. GOOD.

15:49.800 --> 15:51.967
- I'M GONNA GO PACK.

15:51.967 --> 15:54.400
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
YOU'RE STILL GOING?

15:54.400 --> 15:56.933
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU JUST APOLOGIZED.

15:56.933 --> 15:59.600
- YEAH, I APOLOGIZED FOR SAYING
YOU'RE NOT MY BROTHER,

15:59.600 --> 16:02.067
BUT WHY WOULD I APOLOGIZE
FOR YOU TAKING MY MONEY

16:02.067 --> 16:03.633
AND GOING TO VEGAS
WITH IT?

16:03.633 --> 16:06.967
- BECAUSE YOU REALIZE
THAT ONLY A HEARTLESS DICTATOR,

16:06.967 --> 16:09.300
OR MOM,

16:09.300 --> 16:12.200
WOULD TELL PEOPLE
HOW TO LIVE THEIR LIVES.

16:12.200 --> 16:15.933
- YOU'RE CALLING ME
A HEARTLESS DICTATOR...

16:15.933 --> 16:19.633
OR MOM?

16:25.967 --> 16:27.567
- YOU'RE EXACTLY THE SAME.

16:27.567 --> 16:29.267
SO WHY DON'T YOU
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE

16:29.267 --> 16:31.033
AND GO BACK
TO RAYMONDLAND,

16:31.033 --> 16:32.433
WHERE ALL THE BIRDS
SING YOUR NAME

16:32.433 --> 16:35.600
AND THE SQUIRRELS
PRESS YOUR PANTS FOR YOU?

16:40.133 --> 16:42.500
- OH, I SEE.
OH, I HAVE THE LIFE, RIGHT?

16:42.500 --> 16:45.567
OH, IT NEVER ENDS
FOR RAYMOND.

16:45.567 --> 16:48.500
YEAH. YEAH.
I'M LUCKY, RIGHT?

16:48.500 --> 16:50.167
I HAVE SO MUCH MONEY
TO GIVE AWAY

16:50.167 --> 16:52.467
THAT YOU CAN JUST TAKE IT
AND GO TO VEGAS WITH IT,

16:52.467 --> 16:54.733
AND THAT'LL BE YOUR BIG
"SCREW YOU" TO ME.

16:54.733 --> 16:56.700
- OH, YEAH?
WELL, THEN, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

16:56.700 --> 16:59.000
SEE? WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TAKE YOUR CHECK BACK, OKAY?

16:59.000 --> 17:00.300
BECAUSE THE BOTTOM LINE IS,

17:00.300 --> 17:03.167
YOU CAN'T STAND
TO SEE ME HAPPY.

17:03.167 --> 17:04.533
- NO, YOU TAKE IT.
YOU TAKE THIS CHECK.

17:04.533 --> 17:08.133
- I DON'T WANT IT.
- YOU TAKE IT.

17:08.133 --> 17:11.067
TAKE IT! STOP IT!
YOU TAKE IT!

17:17.300 --> 17:19.267
IT'S WORTH $1,000

17:19.267 --> 17:21.167
NOT TO HEAR
ANY OF YOUR CRAP AGAIN.

17:21.167 --> 17:24.033
- MY CRAP IS TRUE!

17:27.133 --> 17:30.600
- WHAT IS IT, HUH?

17:30.600 --> 17:32.600
IT'S LIKE YOU WANT TO
TAKE MY MONEY,

17:32.600 --> 17:36.167
'CAUSE YOU THINK I DON'T EVEN
DESERVE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.

17:37.400 --> 17:42.200
OH, MY GOD.
YOU DO THINK THAT.

17:42.200 --> 17:44.467
YOU DO THINK THAT!
GIVE ME MY CHECK BACK!

17:44.467 --> 17:46.967
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT!
- YOU DIDN'T NOT SAY IT.

17:46.967 --> 17:48.467
- OH, COME ON, RAYMOND,
BE HONEST.

17:48.467 --> 17:50.200
YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT LUCK
HASN'T PLAYED

17:50.200 --> 17:51.567
A SMALL ROLE IN YOUR LIFE?

17:51.567 --> 17:54.033
- WHERE? WHAT?
HOW AM I LUCKIER THAN YOU?

17:54.033 --> 17:57.033
- LOOK AT ME!

17:57.033 --> 18:00.067
LOOK HOW I'M LIVING!
LOOK HOW I EAT!

18:00.067 --> 18:04.700
BOLOGNA AND ORANGE JUICE,
LIKE AN ANIMAL!

18:09.267 --> 18:11.900
WHY DO YOU THINK
I HAVE TO GO TO VEGAS?

18:11.900 --> 18:14.267
BECAUSE I'M NOT LUCKY, RAYMOND.

18:14.267 --> 18:17.400
I NEED A BREAK FROM MY LIFE!

18:32.767 --> 18:34.167
- HERE.

18:34.167 --> 18:36.633
GO TO VEGAS.

18:36.633 --> 18:41.433
- NO. I CAN'T.
I DON'T WANT TO.

18:41.433 --> 18:44.300
SORRY WHAT I SAID, RAYMOND.

18:44.300 --> 18:46.800
YOU DESERVE
EVERYTHING YOU GOT.

18:46.800 --> 18:50.133
I'M JUST A JEALOUS JERK.

18:53.467 --> 18:54.967
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE JEALOUS ABOUT.

18:54.967 --> 18:59.900
I MEAN...YOU DREAM OF TAKING
A VACATION IN VEGAS.

18:59.900 --> 19:01.467
YOU KNOW WHAT I DREAM OF?

19:01.467 --> 19:03.767
FIVE MINUTES IN THE BATHROOM
WITHOUT A GANG OF MANIACS

19:03.767 --> 19:05.700
POUNDING ON THE DOOR.

19:08.367 --> 19:10.600
- YEAH, BUT AT LEAST
IF YOU PASS OUT IN THERE,

19:10.600 --> 19:13.600
YOU'VE GOT SOMEONE
TO COME AND FIND YOU.

19:15.100 --> 19:18.233
- WHAT DO YOU DO
IN THE BATHROOM?

19:24.867 --> 19:28.667
- HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH ME?

19:28.667 --> 19:30.600
- WHERE? VEGAS?

19:30.600 --> 19:34.000
- COME ON, THE BARONE BROTHERS
ON THE STRIP.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.867
- NO...

19:35.867 --> 19:37.300
I CAN'T GO THERE.

19:37.300 --> 19:40.267
I'LL GO ONE DAY,
PROBABLY TEN YEARS FROM NOW,

19:40.267 --> 19:44.133
TO DRAG ALLY
OUT OF A CASINO CHAPEL.

19:44.133 --> 19:45.500
- COME ON.

19:45.500 --> 19:48.033
WHITE TIGERS,
MAGICAL FOUNTAINS,

19:48.033 --> 19:49.867
THEY GOT A HOTEL
FROM EVERY COUNTRY.

19:49.867 --> 19:53.833
IT'S LIKE THE WHOLE WORLD
ON ONE BIG, HOT STREET.

19:53.833 --> 19:55.800
- HEY, DON'T THINK
I WOULDN'T LOVE TO GO.

19:55.800 --> 19:59.033
THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM,
AND SHE'S NOT A SMALL PROBLEM.

19:59.033 --> 20:00.500
- ALL RIGHT, BUT LOOK,

20:00.500 --> 20:03.133
JUST TELL HER IT WOULD BE
REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.

20:03.133 --> 20:05.167
COME ON, TWO OR THREE DAYS.
TELL HER.

20:05.167 --> 20:06.833
I MEAN, SHE MAY NOT CARE
IF YOU'RE HAPPY,

20:06.833 --> 20:11.000
BUT SHE LIKES ME.

20:14.300 --> 20:17.233
- THAT'S TRUE.

20:17.233 --> 20:19.933
- COME ON, RAY.
TWO OR THREE DAYS.

20:19.933 --> 20:25.933
EMPTY HOTEL ROOM, MINIBAR,
PAY-PER-VIEW MOVIES.

20:25.933 --> 20:29.600
ROOM SERVICE CHEESEBURGERS
AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING.

20:31.367 --> 20:33.733
- WE'RE GONNA NEED
ANOTHER THOUSAND.

20:41.233 --> 20:43.133
- HEY.
SO HOW'D IT GO?

20:43.133 --> 20:45.367
- [sighs]
IT DIDN'T GO WELL.

20:45.367 --> 20:46.600
- REALLY?
- NO.

20:46.600 --> 20:49.167
THOSE THINGS I SAID
REALLY HURT HIM.

20:49.167 --> 20:50.800
- DIDN'T YOU APOLOGIZE?

20:50.800 --> 20:52.467
- YEAH, I APOLOGIZED.

20:52.467 --> 20:54.800
HE SAID IT'S GONNA TAKE MORE
THAN AN APOLOGY, YOU KNOW?

20:54.800 --> 20:57.033
HE SAID TALK IS CHEAP.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.133
- OH.
[clicks teeth]

21:02.133 --> 21:04.900
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
- I DON'T KNOW.

21:04.900 --> 21:07.433
I THINK HE'D LIKE IT IF I SPENT
MORE TIME WITH HIM.

21:09.500 --> 21:12.600
- YEAH, THAT WOULD BE GOOD.

21:12.600 --> 21:17.433
- HE'S THINKING OF, LIKE,
SIX DAYS IN VEGAS.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.267
- WHAT?

21:24.267 --> 21:25.700
- THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.
YEAH.

21:25.700 --> 21:28.433
I TOLD HIM,
"NO WAY. I DON'T WANT TO GO."

21:28.433 --> 21:30.167
HE GOT THIS HURT LOOK
ON HIS FACE, YOU KNOW,

21:30.167 --> 21:31.867
AND THEN HE TURNED
HIS BACK TO ME,

21:31.867 --> 21:34.133
AND I THINK HE WAS CRYING,
'CAUSE HE DID ONE OF THOSE--

21:34.133 --> 21:37.333
[inhales heavily]

21:37.333 --> 21:42.100
I DON'T KNOW.
I FELT SO BAD.

21:42.100 --> 21:44.000
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.867
- I THINK MAYBE
IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

21:46.867 --> 21:48.400
- YEAH? YOU THINK?

21:48.400 --> 21:50.667
- YEAH. I THINK YOU SHOULD GO.

21:50.667 --> 21:51.733
AND WHEN YOU GET THERE,

21:51.733 --> 21:52.900
SEE WHAT THE ODDS ARE

21:52.900 --> 21:55.000
OF ME BEING HERE
WHEN YOU GET BACK.
