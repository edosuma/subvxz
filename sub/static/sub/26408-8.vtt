00:01.870 --> 00:04.031
Previously onSEAL Team... Andres Doza, the head

00:04.090 --> 00:06.558
of the most lethal cartel
In MeXIco.

00:06.610 --> 00:09.955
They executed an American
DEA agent.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.786
CISEN recovered the Mercedes.
GPS tells the story.

00:12.830 --> 00:14.388
Multiple visits
to local businesses.

00:14.440 --> 00:17.739
RITA: One business stands out:
The Reyes Talent Agency,

00:17.800 --> 00:21.179
owned by a very successful
businesswoman, Carla Reyes.

00:21.230 --> 00:23.539
MANDY:
There will be a Doza connection,
we just have to figure it out.

00:23.580 --> 00:26.014
Who the hell are you?Right now, I'm your executioner.

00:26.060 --> 00:28.108
Why not make me a friend?

00:30.070 --> 00:33.540
"Muerta."Marked for death.
My family.

00:33.590 --> 00:35.114
Now do you understand?

00:35.160 --> 00:36.718
RAY: You blame yourself
for the position he's in.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.761
You're latching on.Latching onto what, Ray?

00:38.820 --> 00:40.037
A family that needs
to be kept together

00:40.080 --> 00:42.162
'cause yours was torn apart.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.201
I don't think that I can
be with you anymore.

00:44.260 --> 00:46.558
I'm sorry.

00:46.610 --> 00:47.907
Cheers, buddy.Send that down.
Here we go.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.217
I'll meet you outside.
He's getting the drinks.Yeah.

00:51.260 --> 00:52.431
All right.See you!

00:52.480 --> 00:56.826
Oh, man. Here
we go. Feet up.

00:56.880 --> 00:59.610
The target was Gonzalez.Are you questioning me
right now, Mandy?

00:59.660 --> 01:02.128
We don't stand a chance
of getting Doza

01:02.190 --> 01:03.316
if your head is back home.

01:20.290 --> 01:23.726
Happy anniversary,
Andres Doza.

01:23.770 --> 01:27.388
Maria, you shouldn't have.

01:30.130 --> 01:31.347
And my present?

01:35.960 --> 01:38.656
As soon as I get back.

01:38.700 --> 01:40.918
I promise.

01:50.580 --> 01:52.491
You forgot to remind me
it's my anniversary.

01:52.540 --> 01:53.495
I have no present.

01:53.540 --> 01:54.757
LAZO:
What, your girlfriend?

01:54.810 --> 01:56.880
My wife, fool.

01:56.940 --> 01:58.760
Just give her the gift of cash.

01:58.810 --> 02:01.415
Cash only works
with girlfriends, Lazo.

02:01.460 --> 02:04.281
Not wives.
One day, you'll learn that.

02:26.490 --> 02:29.095
I entrusted you
with the plaza, Javier,

02:29.140 --> 02:31.836
and you repay me
by stealing from me?

02:31.890 --> 02:35.189
No, Seor Doza, this is
all a misunderstanding.

02:35.240 --> 02:38.232
Look at the position you have
put your employees in.

02:38.280 --> 02:41.363
What will you tell
his family?

02:44.860 --> 02:46.066
You think I don't track

02:46.120 --> 02:47.985
how much product comes
through the plaza?

02:48.030 --> 02:49.816
Please, Andres,

02:49.860 --> 02:51.464
it's my wife.

02:51.510 --> 02:53.774
My wife handles
all of the accounting.

02:53.820 --> 02:57.950
Well, that's fortunate...
because she's here.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.218
She can clear the matter.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.836
DOZA:
Gabriela...

03:09.880 --> 03:14.351
is _it true what
JaVIer IS saying?

03:14.410 --> 03:16.366
You're responsible
for the theft

03:16.410 --> 03:17.365
of my money?

03:17.410 --> 03:19.366
No.

03:19.410 --> 03:21.366
No. What are you
talking about?

03:23.330 --> 03:25.844
Convincing. I believe her.

03:25.900 --> 03:28.858
No, I did not say that
Gabriela was responsible.

03:28.900 --> 03:31.209
I said she handles
all the...

03:31.250 --> 03:32.376
Help me! Oh, my God!

03:39.610 --> 03:43.341
Please accept my
sincere apologies

03:43.390 --> 03:45.346
for this ugliness.

03:45.390 --> 03:47.119
But I cannot go easy
on you and your employees

03:47.180 --> 03:48.954
because you're family.

03:50.620 --> 03:54.613
Please, please,
please don't kill me...

03:54.660 --> 03:56.139
I am not a monster.

03:58.020 --> 04:00.659
DOZA: Do you really think
I would kill my wife's sister?

04:00.710 --> 04:04.498
Maria would never forgive me.

04:04.540 --> 04:08.067
So I want you to go home,
never speak of this.

04:08.110 --> 04:11.898
Tell Maria that Javier,
pig that he is,

04:11.940 --> 04:14.022
left you for another woman.

04:14.070 --> 04:16.766
Okay, Andres. S.
Thank you. Thank you.

04:18.950 --> 04:21.510
Shh...

04:24.820 --> 04:27.300
Your sister would like these.

04:27.350 --> 04:30.262
Yes, Maria would.
Take them.

04:36.840 --> 04:38.649
Gracias, Gabriela.

05:19.310 --> 05:20.572
How are your sons?

05:20.620 --> 05:22.053
They're bored.Yeah.

05:22.100 --> 05:24.409
They miss their friends.Mm-hmm.

05:24.450 --> 05:26.406
They don't understand
why they're here.

05:26.450 --> 05:28.236
Danger isn't real for them.

05:28.280 --> 05:30.054
It's our job
to protect them.

05:30.110 --> 05:31.930
Isn't that right, Lopez?You sound like a good father.

05:31.980 --> 05:33.754
Jury's still out
on that one.

05:33.810 --> 05:35.493
I'm trying to be a good father.
Day to day, right?

05:35.550 --> 05:38.155
That's all you can do.
Day to day.

05:38.200 --> 05:41.328
You know, what you did for me
last night, coming after me,

05:41.380 --> 05:43.428
that took courage.

05:43.470 --> 05:45.074
I thought I was doing
what was best for my family.

05:45.120 --> 05:47.463
I wasn't. Thank you.

05:47.520 --> 05:50.648
Getting Doza is what's
best for your family right now.

05:50.690 --> 05:52.476
We do that, and
we get your boys

05:52.520 --> 05:53.999
back to their
friends, okay?

05:54.040 --> 05:55.473
God willing.

05:55.520 --> 05:56.919
Nobody's gotten close
to Doza yet.

05:56.960 --> 06:00.919
Let's hope snagging Carla Reyes
leads us somewhere.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.702
'Cause she's all we got
right now.

06:03.750 --> 06:06.059
Right?

06:12.850 --> 06:15.148
You got anything yet?Not yet, but we will.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.668
Getting tired of
waiting on you.

06:22.250 --> 06:26.858
Phone records, bank records,
travel records.

06:26.900 --> 06:29.778
What are we missing?

06:29.820 --> 06:31.811
Carla Reyes's bra size.

06:31.860 --> 06:34.078
And the date of
her First Communion.

06:34.130 --> 06:37.600
Otherwise... we know
everything about her.

06:37.650 --> 06:39.606
All we have to show for it
are the names

06:39.660 --> 06:42.049
of a few mid-level
cartel figures.

06:42.090 --> 06:45.480
Dante Vega,
a money man for Doza,

06:45.530 --> 06:48.442
visited Carla Reyes several
times; we know this.

06:48.490 --> 06:51.960
There's got to be something
more, some deeper connection

06:52.020 --> 06:53.351
that Carla has to Doza.

06:53.410 --> 06:55.492
Unless there isn't.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.098
We've been
through everything.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.754
Twice.

06:58.800 --> 07:02.896
No. She's hiding something.

07:02.940 --> 07:04.896
Let's go through it again.

07:04.940 --> 07:06.453
Hiyah!

07:06.510 --> 07:08.944
Wake up, Sleeping Beauty.

07:08.990 --> 07:11.117
Rise and shine.

07:11.160 --> 07:13.856
Nope.
You see,
I think I found a cure

07:13.910 --> 07:15.866
for this emotional pain
that ails you.

07:15.910 --> 07:17.389
What the hell are you
talking about, man?

07:17.430 --> 07:18.738
Oh, you fighting your way

07:18.780 --> 07:19.906
through the battlefield
of despair.

07:19.960 --> 07:21.564
Look at that.

07:21.610 --> 07:23.521
What's a battlefield of despair?
What are you talking about?

07:23.570 --> 07:24.696
Right.

07:24.740 --> 07:27.300
See, you need a plan.

07:27.350 --> 07:29.432
How 'bout I stop
drinking bad tequila?

07:29.490 --> 07:32.186
Is that a good plan?Not enough of one.

07:32.230 --> 07:34.403
You see, a plan is waging war
and taking out the enemy.

07:34.450 --> 07:37.010
And tequila, my friend,
is not your enemy.

07:37.060 --> 07:39.108
Heartbreak is.

07:39.150 --> 07:41.141
You understand?Oh, all right, Sonny.

07:41.190 --> 07:43.146
You know what, I would
honestly rather right now

07:43.200 --> 07:45.191
you wrapped your little
skiwies around my face

07:45.240 --> 07:47.504
than hear what you're
about to tell me.
Okay.

07:47.550 --> 07:50.018
One might ask how you
wage war against heartbreak.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.504
I will tell you.
Step one:

07:52.550 --> 07:54.506
you need to minimize it
in all forms.

07:54.560 --> 07:55.720
Which means you need
to block Stella

07:55.770 --> 07:57.818
on all social media
platforms.

07:57.860 --> 07:59.339
No late-night perusing
of her pictures,

07:59.390 --> 08:02.257
and no checking on her
updated relationship status.

08:02.300 --> 08:05.474
Is this seriously
happening right now?Uh-huh. Step two:

08:05.520 --> 08:09.047
you need to create
a heartbreak-free environment.

08:09.090 --> 08:11.399
That means purging
your living space

08:11.440 --> 08:12.657
of all gifts.
Yeah.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.133
Anything associated with

08:14.180 --> 08:15.579
the-the person
of-of your affection.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.099
Hold on a second.

08:17.140 --> 08:18.835
Did you just say
"person of affection"?

08:18.880 --> 08:20.882
Yes.

08:20.930 --> 08:22.534
Where did you,
where did you get this?

08:22.580 --> 08:26.459
Uh, well...
Sonny?

08:26.500 --> 08:28.411
Did you google how to
get over a breakup?

08:28.460 --> 08:31.634
No. My...

08:31.680 --> 08:33.022
Okay, look,
I got it from Cosmo.

08:34.510 --> 08:37.070
You boys having fun?

08:37.120 --> 08:38.462
We're healing, Ray.

08:38.510 --> 08:39.295
What, from last night?

08:39.340 --> 08:41.331
Yes.

08:41.390 --> 08:43.460
What the hell is it I_ hear about
you two gonng outSIde the wrre?

08:43.520 --> 08:45.556
Who told you that?RAY: The moron police.

08:45.610 --> 08:47.214
Got you dead to rights.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.125
You two witness some dude
get schwacked at a strip club,

08:49.180 --> 08:50.386
and you decide to hit the town?

08:50.440 --> 08:52.567
Okay, look, Mr. Buzzkill,

08:52.610 --> 08:55.044
it was my idea to
take the young buck out.

08:55.090 --> 08:56.489
No, come on, Sonny.

08:56.530 --> 08:57.428
It was my idea
to go to the club.

09:01.410 --> 09:02.923
What do you think Jason would
say if he found out?

09:02.970 --> 09:05.575
What could he say? Jason went
outside the wire, too.

09:05.630 --> 09:07.359
Yeah, to help Lopez.

09:07.410 --> 09:09.275
Him and his entire family
has been marked for death.

09:09.330 --> 09:11.139
Ray, you know the White House
sent us down here

09:11.200 --> 09:13.282
because Andres Doza murdered
an American DEA agent?

09:13.330 --> 09:15.025
Graham Kowit.

09:15.070 --> 09:16.583
Remember him?

09:16.640 --> 09:17.891
Yeah, well, he's the reason
we're here.

09:17.940 --> 09:19.339
Not the, uh, not
the Lopez family.

09:19.380 --> 09:24.113
It is not your place to
question number one, Spenser.

09:24.170 --> 09:25.944
Or me.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.605
Now, you go outside
the wire again,

09:28.650 --> 09:29.730
I'll drop the hammer.

09:37.660 --> 09:40.174
We can go through this
ten more times.

09:40.230 --> 09:43.222
It won't matter.
Reyes IS a dead end.

09:43.270 --> 09:45.090
Maybe not. H need to see
the bank statements

09:45.140 --> 09:46.050
for the past two years.

09:46.100 --> 09:48.318
Thanks.

09:52.110 --> 09:53.099
Yep.

09:53.150 --> 09:55.232
What is it?

09:58.720 --> 10:00.119
Carla's been holding out on us.

10:04.380 --> 10:07.031
REYES:
I gave you everything.

10:07.080 --> 10:08.809
RITA:
No, you gave us

10:08.860 --> 10:10.999
Doza's middle management.

10:11.040 --> 10:12.860
You asked for_the names
of my clients.

10:12.910 --> 10:14.514
MANDY: All of your
clients, Carla.

10:14.570 --> 10:17.437
Not just the ones
who don't terrify you.

10:19.830 --> 10:22.560
You keep meticulous records.

10:24.440 --> 10:27.136
Too meticulous.

10:27.190 --> 10:29.613
There's a lot of
outgomg payments

10:29.670 --> 10:31.092
to some of your girls.

10:31.150 --> 10:33.368
No corresponding
incoming payments from a client.

10:33.410 --> 10:36.231
Somebody's getting
a freebie.

10:36.280 --> 10:39.363
Must be someone special.Someone scary.

10:39.420 --> 10:43.117
MANDY: Someone you know
will kill you if you talk.

10:43.160 --> 10:45.196
You're gonna have to talk.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.556
He willkill me.

10:54.610 --> 10:58.125
Then helping us find Doza is
your best chance for survival.

10:58.170 --> 11:02.391
Help us, Carla, and you
can go back to your life.

11:02.440 --> 11:04.089
The one you had
before the cartel.

11:14.630 --> 11:16.279
Luis Castillo.

11:16.320 --> 11:19.050
He's the client
I've been compIng.

11:19.110 --> 11:20.884
Luis Castillo?

11:24.850 --> 11:26.636
Who is Luis Castillo?

11:26.680 --> 11:28.762
He's Doza's most trusted
lieutenant.

11:33.600 --> 11:37.639
They call him El Lazo.

11:37.690 --> 11:38.770
This is the break we need.

11:38.820 --> 11:40.424
We find Lazo, we find Doza.

11:47.180 --> 11:49.819
LOPEZ: Colonel, I need
to be a part of it.

11:49.880 --> 11:52.314
My mind's good.
I got it set straight.

11:52.360 --> 11:56.057
Let the man work.
Let him work.

11:56.100 --> 11:57.442
MANDY: Okay.
One of the very few

11:57.490 --> 11:59.924
pictures we have of Doza.

11:59.980 --> 12:03.757
Beside him is Luis Castillo,
aka El Lazo.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.971
He is Doza's second in command
and his oldest friend.

12:06.020 --> 12:07.282
E| Lazo?

12:07.330 --> 12:09.104
"The Noose."

12:09.160 --> 12:11.720
All right, look, is there a link
between Lazo and Carla Reyes?

12:11.770 --> 12:14.728
MANDY: Lazo uses Reyes's
escort services.

12:14.770 --> 12:16.761
Every time Lazo
comes to Mexico City,

12:16.820 --> 12:18.378
he calls her, for a woman.

12:18.430 --> 12:19.772
How often is he in town?

12:19.820 --> 12:21.424
Last trip was eight weeks ago.

12:21.470 --> 12:23.950
So we just wait around
till he gets horny.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.218
JASON:
No. This is what we do.

12:26.260 --> 12:27.306
We lure him to Mexico City.

12:28.700 --> 12:31.009
What's your proposal on that?

12:31.050 --> 12:32.210
This guy's Doza's
number two, right?

12:32.270 --> 12:33.749
What's the
number two guy do?

12:33.790 --> 12:36.964
He takes care of all
of the major problems.

12:37.010 --> 12:38.614
What do we do?

12:38.670 --> 12:39.568
Create a major problem.

12:39.620 --> 12:40.962
Hit one of his assets.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.147
What?

12:45.190 --> 12:46.976
This.

12:47.020 --> 12:49.625
This is a pottery factory.
It's right outside the city.

12:49.680 --> 12:51.636
This is a front for Doza's
biggest meth lab.

12:51.680 --> 12:53.238
We take it out.

12:53.290 --> 12:55.155
Perfect.Doza's a businessman.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.202
Right? I'm sure he's got losses
built in to the whole system.

12:57.250 --> 12:58.945
So we just take out
this one lab,

12:58.990 --> 13:00.469
it might not even
elicit a response.

13:00.510 --> 13:02.978
Unless the lab was taken out
by a rIval cartel.

13:03.040 --> 13:04.814
Doza would never ignore that.

13:04.870 --> 13:06.076
Mm-hmm.

13:06.130 --> 13:08.519
You want to start
our own cartel?

13:08.570 --> 13:10.470
Damn straight.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.044
Los Badasses. That's got
a nice ring to it, doesn't it?

13:13.350 --> 13:14.749
CLAY: All right,
so we

13:14.790 --> 13:17.839
We hope that Lazo takes
the bait, comes back to town?

13:17.880 --> 13:19.438
We hit it hard, man.
Let's go hunting, boys.

13:19.490 --> 13:21.185
Yeah, we need to
blend in for this op.

13:21.230 --> 13:23.403
Wear civilian clothes,
cover our faces,

13:23.450 --> 13:27.147
minimal comms, ND vehicles
and, most importantly,

13:27.190 --> 13:30.273
the attack itself needs
to look like a cartel hit.

13:30.330 --> 13:32.275
Rough and messy, right?Rough and messy.

13:35.160 --> 13:37.765
We can do a simultaneous breach
on two sides of the building.

13:37.810 --> 13:40.278
Clear towards the middle.
Set charges, break out.

13:40.340 --> 13:41.637
JASON:
How many hostiles you expect

13:41.690 --> 13:43.021
we're gonna encounter here?

13:43.080 --> 13:45.719
LOPEZ: Doza will have
armed men there.

13:45.780 --> 13:48.169
Understand: many who work in the
factory don't want to be there.

13:48.210 --> 13:50.121
They made bad choices,
they're not bad people.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.123
All right, we're not out
to hurt nobody, right?

13:54.180 --> 13:55.829
So we let them go, hope they
spread the word back to Doza.

13:59.270 --> 14:00.965
SONNY:
Rules of engagement?

14:01.010 --> 14:02.489
ERIC:
If they're armed, we engage.

14:02.530 --> 14:04.919
Needs to be fast. In, out.

14:41.270 --> 14:44.137
JASON: Havoc, this is 1.
I pass Petty.

14:44.180 --> 14:46.262
ERIC: Bravo 1, this is Havoc.
I copy Petty.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.003
JASON:
Bravo 2, this is 1, stand by.

14:48.060 --> 14:49.448
Bravo 1, this is Bravo 2.
In position.

14:49.490 --> 14:51.185
Execute, execute, execute.

16:07.310 --> 16:09.175
Have your men set the
charges, then meet us
back at the exfil point.

16:09.220 --> 16:10.699
Havoc, this is 1.
We're passing Earnhardt.

16:10.750 --> 16:12.172
ERIC: Good copy, Bravo 1.
Passing Earnhardt.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.358
JASON:
Hey.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.049
Nice work out there.

17:00.100 --> 17:01.442
Once the bullets
started flying,

17:01.490 --> 17:03.048
all my problems went away.

17:03.100 --> 17:07.139
Yeah, I know that drill.
I know it all so well.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.668
It's the calm in the chaos.

17:09.720 --> 17:12.063
But now we're back.

17:12.110 --> 17:13.668
And so are your problems.

17:27.650 --> 17:32.599
My... my sons,

17:32.660 --> 17:34.821
they can't live
like this forever.

17:37.140 --> 17:40.655
They did nothing wrong.

17:42.060 --> 17:44.051
You got to
hang in there.

17:44.100 --> 17:47.445
Like I told you,
we're gonna get this done.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.400
We're not leaving
till we get Doza,

17:49.450 --> 17:53.011
and your family
is safe.

17:55.070 --> 17:56.367
Here it is right here.

17:56.420 --> 17:57.239
Uh...

17:57.290 --> 17:58.894
ALL:
Oh!

17:58.940 --> 18:00.419
Another slap, another drink.

18:05.170 --> 18:08.162
Ah, man,
he is getting beat up.

18:08.210 --> 18:10.166
Hey, you guys mind turning
this down a little bit?

18:10.210 --> 18:12.553
Some of us have better things
to do than listen to this crap.

18:12.610 --> 18:14.032
Ain't that right, Spenser?

18:14.090 --> 18:15.432
SONNY: What are you talking
about, Ray Perry?

18:15.480 --> 18:17.562
This is the best
damn show on TV.

18:17.610 --> 18:18.952
_Little senorita
right there, well,

18:19.010 --> 18:20.955
she could slap me
any day of the week,

18:21.010 --> 18:23.001
'cause she is half-crazy,
half-fire.

18:23.050 --> 18:25.006
That is the perfect
Sonny Quinn mix right there.

18:25.060 --> 18:26.618
Mm, I'm just a little surprised

18:26.670 --> 18:28.615
that her name doesn't
end in a Y, Sonny.

18:28.670 --> 18:30.968
Meaning?Uh, Tammy, Brandy,
Tiffany, Charity.

18:31.020 --> 18:32.442
See a theme here?

18:34.280 --> 18:36.976
Well, let's talk about
your track record there, Davis.

18:37.020 --> 18:38.191
Let's not. Let's not.Okay-- Todd.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.457
Okay.

18:39.500 --> 18:40.899
Then there was Keith.Stop.

18:40.940 --> 18:42.157
And then the winner, winner,
chicken dinner:

18:42.200 --> 18:43.155
Dakota.Okay.

18:45.380 --> 18:47.200
Here it goes again.
Here she comes.

18:47.250 --> 18:49.036
ALL:
Oh!

18:49.080 --> 18:51.992
SONNY: Oh, he's got welts.
Look at him. Look at him.

18:52.040 --> 18:53.689
He needs some ice.

18:53.740 --> 18:56.254
CISEN's picked up
a lot of chatter about
our hit on the lab.

18:56.300 --> 18:59.519
Specifically, speculation that
the Merida Cartel was behind it.

18:59.570 --> 19:02.698
That's good.You realize that even if
H Lazo comes to town,

19:02.750 --> 19:04.695
there's no guarantee he'll call
Carla for a woman?

19:04.750 --> 19:08.447
He will.It's been three days and nada.

19:08.490 --> 19:10.879
He'll call.

19:10.930 --> 19:13.888
We're all creatures of habit.

19:13.930 --> 19:16.660
Oof, this is the part I hate.
The waiting.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.790
You picked the wrong job.

19:21.550 --> 19:23.506
What got you into this work?

19:23.550 --> 19:28.761
A CIA recruiter approached me
in college.

19:28.810 --> 19:31.506
I had no idea what the job
entailed, but... how about you?

19:31.560 --> 19:33.949
I'm from a small town.

19:33.990 --> 19:37.608
An only child,
so my father was my hero.

19:37.650 --> 19:40.255
Mm.He was a kind man.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.780
Always happy,

19:42.830 --> 19:46.084
until the cartels came.

19:46.140 --> 19:48.563
From then on, he lived in fear

19:48.620 --> 19:52.613
that they would force him
to grow drugs.

19:52.660 --> 19:57.188
They never did, but my
father's-- his fear and his,

19:57.230 --> 20:02.327
his worry replaced his,
his faith and his joy.

20:02.370 --> 20:06.761
And I grew up wanting
no one else to know that fear.

20:11.640 --> 20:14.200
What about
your family?

20:14.250 --> 20:18.778
Oh, um, I never knew my father

20:18.820 --> 20:20.993
and, uh, my mother
was a criminal,

20:21.040 --> 20:22.553
for lack of a better word.

20:22.610 --> 20:25.773
Actually, that's
the perfect word for it.

20:25.830 --> 20:29.391
She was a scammer,

20:29.440 --> 20:31.135
a con artist.

20:31.180 --> 20:34.229
Credit card fraud,
insurance fraud, identity theft.

20:34.270 --> 20:37.353
She was always working
one angle or another,

20:37.410 --> 20:40.402
one man or another;
one of them was my dad.

20:40.450 --> 20:43.055
I don't think
I've ever

20:43.110 --> 20:45.055
heard her tell the truth
about anything,

20:45.110 --> 20:46.805
not even the weather.

20:46.850 --> 20:48.841
That's no way to grow up.

20:48.890 --> 20:51.632
Nope.

20:51.680 --> 20:54.410
Hi, Em, it's Dad.
I'm calling you again

20:54.470 --> 20:56.461
'cause according to
the schedule that we have,

20:56.510 --> 20:58.978
I was supposed to
talk to you today.

20:59.040 --> 21:01.986
So just do me a favor,
can you call me back

21:02.040 --> 21:03.644
and tell me that you're
getting these messages.

21:03.690 --> 21:05.510
I'd like to hear
from my kids, okay?

21:05.560 --> 21:07.255
I love you.

21:07.300 --> 21:08.562
Bye.

21:10.660 --> 21:13.652
Hey.
All good at home?

21:13.700 --> 21:16.134
Yeah, all is great
at home, just, you know,

21:16.180 --> 21:19.923
the kids, they're MIA,
Davis. I can't...

21:19.970 --> 21:21.449
They're probably
just out having fun.

21:21.490 --> 21:22.741
Well, if they're
out having fun,

21:22.800 --> 21:24.927
it'd be nice if they would
call to confirm that.

21:24.970 --> 21:26.403
Talk to me,
leave me a voice mail.

21:26.450 --> 21:29.237
I've called, like, 19,000 times.
They're not picking up.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.976
I don't know. Maybe I can
get some sleep when they do.

21:32.020 --> 21:34.068
I think that every kid
feels a certain responsibility

21:34.110 --> 21:35.759
to drive his
parents crazy.

21:35.810 --> 21:38.677
Well, then I guess my kids
are overachievers, Davis.

21:38.730 --> 21:42.632
Hey, how're you doing?
How're you holding up?

21:42.690 --> 21:44.590
How am I doing?

21:47.480 --> 21:51.166
How am I doing?

21:51.220 --> 21:53.120
I don't know how to answer that.
I really don't.

21:53.180 --> 21:55.865
Good.

21:55.920 --> 21:59.174
Okay.

21:59.230 --> 22:02.575
I guess it depends on
the time of day, right?

22:02.620 --> 22:05.487
Got to get Lazo here.

22:05.540 --> 22:08.100
I got to get him here.
I got to lure this guy here

22:08.150 --> 22:09.663
'cause I got to do something.
Man, I'm...

22:09.710 --> 22:12.235
I get it.Yeah.

22:12.280 --> 22:16.102
Hey. What you did for Lopez,
that was...

22:16.160 --> 22:17.366
It's good to give men hope.

22:17.420 --> 22:20.503
Hope.

22:20.550 --> 22:23.337
Not a lot of hope
these days here.

22:23.380 --> 22:24.893
You've seen the stats, right?
You read about them?

22:27.470 --> 22:31.645
30,000 people were killed
last year in this war in Mexico.

22:31.690 --> 22:35.694
That is 80 families
a day torn apart.

22:35.740 --> 22:40.348
I know. I get it. It's hard
to wrap your head around.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.960
Yeah.

22:44.920 --> 22:46.922
Yeah, it is.

22:46.970 --> 22:50.406
But, hey, thank God
for the tequila, right?

23:01.160 --> 23:03.196
Bag's all yours.

23:03.250 --> 23:04.854
I'm not here
for that.

23:04.900 --> 23:07.243
I'm here to find out why
you've been hitting that bag

23:07.290 --> 23:08.985
like you've been watching
Rockyon a loop.

23:11.950 --> 23:14.680
Nothing's wrong.

23:14.740 --> 23:17.345
The hell it's not.

23:17.390 --> 23:19.176
Something is wrong.

23:19.220 --> 23:20.608
Clay Spenser I know

23:20.660 --> 23:23.470
doesn't question his leaders
or disobey team rules.

23:23.530 --> 23:26.260
You're off.

23:26.310 --> 23:28.574
And I'm not going away
till you tell me why.

23:28.620 --> 23:31.088
It's, uh...

23:34.100 --> 23:35.317
Stella.

23:37.630 --> 23:40.098
She left me.

23:44.850 --> 23:49.332
I... thought everything was
solid between you two.

23:52.690 --> 23:55.386
Yeah, it was.

23:55.430 --> 23:59.469
Yeah, and then, uh,
then it wasn't.

23:59.520 --> 24:03.342
Adam's death really
hit her hard.

24:03.390 --> 24:06.041
Then me taking a round
terrified her.

24:10.360 --> 24:12.089
The thing is, H...

24:12.140 --> 24:13.653
I thought that
I could have it all.

24:13.710 --> 24:17.271
I did. Thought I could
have the team,

24:17.320 --> 24:19.015
the family,

24:19.060 --> 24:21.585
you know, as long as I just,
as long as I just tried,

24:21.630 --> 24:24.190
as long as I did it better
than my old, my old man,

24:24.240 --> 24:25.195
better than Jason.

24:27.680 --> 24:29.762
I was wrong, Ray.

24:29.810 --> 24:31.459
Reality is, it's a choice.

24:34.640 --> 24:35.948
It's one or the other.

24:38.120 --> 24:40.168
Me and Naima make it work.

24:40.210 --> 24:41.905
Yeah, well, you two
are a miracle.

24:41.950 --> 24:44.475
Miracles don't happen
for most people.

24:48.480 --> 24:49.697
Look,

24:49.740 --> 24:51.696
just because this isn't
the life for Stella

24:51.750 --> 24:55.447
does not mean you cannot
have them both.

24:55.490 --> 24:58.357
Just maybe not with her.

24:58.400 --> 25:00.186
That's not what I want to hear.

25:03.450 --> 25:08.103
Clay. The pain is real.

25:08.150 --> 25:10.289
But you are off.

25:10.330 --> 25:11.843
And you got to get
yourself squared away

25:11.900 --> 25:13.856
for the good of the team.

25:13.900 --> 25:17.540
You sure I'm the only one you
should be giving this speech to?

25:19.470 --> 25:21.426
It seems to me the only one
who's worried

25:21.470 --> 25:24.598
about the good of the team,
Ray, is you.

25:24.650 --> 25:26.550
It's not Bravo 1.

25:52.110 --> 25:53.008
Okay.

25:56.070 --> 25:58.459
Okay. Bye.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.725
Now what happens?

26:02.770 --> 26:06.991
You do everything exactly
the way you've done it before.

26:07.040 --> 26:11.773
You_do not deviate
In any way.

26:11.830 --> 26:15.049
These agents will take you home
and they'll stay with you.

26:18.440 --> 26:19.350
It's almost over, Carla.

26:22.230 --> 26:23.618
Muy bien.

26:23.660 --> 26:26.788
MANDY:
Four hours ago,

26:26.840 --> 26:29.627
Lazo called Carla to set up
an escort for tonight.

26:29.670 --> 26:31.581
Okay.
Who's the lucky lady?

26:31.630 --> 26:35.236
Sofia Nunez. She's an
aspIrIng actress,

26:35.280 --> 26:37.419
one-time Mexicana Universal
contestant.

26:37.460 --> 26:40.850
Sofia is meeting Lazo at
a nightclub called La Sociale.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.458
So we gonna pick
him up en route

26:42.510 --> 26:44.683
or wait till he gets
to his shag pad?

26:44.730 --> 26:46.595
MARTINEZ: Picking him up's
gonna do us no good.

26:46.640 --> 26:48.289
The minute that Lazo
goes off the ngd,

26:48.340 --> 26:49.386
Doza's gonna know
something is up.

26:49.430 --> 26:51.648
All right, so what's the plan?

26:51.690 --> 26:53.510
After Lazo meets Sofia
at the club,

26:53.560 --> 26:55.380
we track her cell
to wherever he takes her.

26:55.430 --> 26:57.864
CISEN will then
step in to establish
surveillance on El Lazo

26:57.920 --> 26:59.524
going forward.That's great and all,

26:59.570 --> 27:01.879
but a guy like Lazo isn't just
gonna walk in the front door.

27:01.920 --> 27:04.229
So what we need to do

27:04.270 --> 27:06.318
is we need to verify
he's inside with Sofia.

27:06.360 --> 27:08.669
You want to put eyes
in the club?

27:08.710 --> 27:11.577
Mm-hmm.
Not sure we're
gonna blend In.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.143
Uh, well, La Sociale
is a hot spot

27:13.190 --> 27:14.532
for Europeans
and Americans.

27:14.580 --> 27:16.753
And the Cartel.

27:16.800 --> 27:18.142
Okay, so who's going in?

27:18.200 --> 27:22.102
Couples attract
less attention.

27:22.160 --> 27:23.377
Meaning?

27:23.420 --> 27:25.376
Meaning you've got
a date tonight.

27:25.420 --> 27:28.639
Should our cover be _that we're
celebrating an anniversary

27:28.690 --> 27:30.021
or on our honeymoon?

27:30.080 --> 27:31.331
I'd say the honeymoon's over.

27:33.210 --> 27:35.166
All right, let's get some rest.
Gonna be a long night.

27:35.210 --> 27:37.952
A lot of moving pieces
in this one, brother.

27:38.000 --> 27:38.898
Never thought I'd miss
the simplicity

27:38.960 --> 27:39.904
of kicking down doors.

27:39.960 --> 27:41.348
What, a low-vis op,

27:41.390 --> 27:42.914
bunch of Cartel killers
in a club.

27:42.960 --> 27:43.915
What can go wrong?

27:43.960 --> 27:45.871
Besides that.

27:56.410 --> 27:59.106
La Sociale is the most popular
club in the city with two levels

27:59.150 --> 28:00.492
and an estimated
nightly attendance

28:00.540 --> 28:02.451
of about 2,000 people.

28:02.500 --> 28:04.548
Between service doors
and VIP entrances,

28:04.590 --> 28:07.058
the club has more_ than a dozen
entry and eXIt pomts.

28:07.120 --> 28:09.247
We're gonna need low-vis
vehicles watching

28:09.290 --> 28:11.076
from every side
of this building.

28:11.120 --> 28:12.894
RITA: La Sociale
is Cartel-friendly.

28:12.950 --> 28:14.815
That means that Lazo's men
Will be strapped.

28:14.860 --> 28:15.986
RAY:
But the metal detectors

28:16.040 --> 28:17.905
means Mandy and Jason won't be.

28:17.950 --> 28:20.214
No armor, no comms either.
That's risky.

28:23.520 --> 28:26.603
Reyes instructed Sofia
to arrive at 10:30.

28:26.660 --> 28:28.821
The club is at its busiest
between 10:00 and 2:00.

28:28.880 --> 28:31.747
It's gonna be difficult to keep
track of El Lazo in that crowd.

28:31.790 --> 28:33.041
ERIC:
All we need to do

28:33.100 --> 28:34.829
is confirm that Sofia
leaves with him.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.836
Then we can track her phone
to his next location.

28:36.880 --> 28:38.097
You thinking
a follow op?

28:38.150 --> 28:40.141
Two cars, one front,
one behind?

28:40.190 --> 28:42.010
DAVIS: Given the nature of
this city-- its narrow streets,

28:42.060 --> 28:43.539
sharp turns,
and heavy traffic--

28:43.590 --> 28:45.103
I suggest you follow
from a distance.

28:45.150 --> 28:46.970
Standard CTR. Agreed.

28:47.020 --> 28:49.102
I'm assuming ISR's still out?

28:49.160 --> 28:51.116
Drone use over the city
would require approval

28:51.160 --> 28:52.889
from multiple
government agencies.

28:52.940 --> 28:55.682
We might as well tell Doza
that we're tailing his boy.

28:55.730 --> 28:57.766
Not a lot of options.

28:57.820 --> 28:59.981
Well, if we want Doza,
we go with what we got.

29:18.190 --> 29:20.613
SONNY:
Damn, look at that.

29:20.670 --> 29:22.661
CLAY: We definitely
drew the short straw.

29:22.710 --> 29:25.178
Mm-mm. No way in hell.

29:25.240 --> 29:27.845
That music inside
is like a sick calf

29:27.890 --> 29:29.107
bawling for mama.

29:57.010 --> 29:58.875
Bravo 2,
this is Bravo 3.

29:58.920 --> 30:00.911
How's it look
on your snde?

30:00.970 --> 30:03.268
RAY:
We've got multiple fighting-age
males entering the club.

30:03.320 --> 30:05.276
All armed.

30:05.320 --> 30:06.924
They're likely getting
ready for Lazo's arrival.

30:06.970 --> 30:09.621
Jason and Mandy are in
the lion's den now.

30:14.940 --> 30:16.760
MANDY:
Lazo's date's arrived.

30:31.300 --> 30:34.258
Havoc, this is Bravo 2.
Bravo 1 has eyes on Cinderella.

30:34.310 --> 30:35.698
As does Rita.

30:38.010 --> 30:40.353
Signal ping is working.
We have a lock on her phone.

30:40.400 --> 30:42.709
ERIC:
That's a good copy, Bravo 2.

30:42.750 --> 30:43.785
We have it as well.

30:43.840 --> 30:45.876
Let us know when
the HVT arrives.

30:45.930 --> 30:47.409
RAY:
Copy that.

30:47.450 --> 30:48.929
I don't like not having
eyes on them.

30:48.970 --> 30:50.961
Rita's their backup.
All they have to do

30:51.020 --> 30:52.317
is stay locked
onto Sofia's phone

30:52.370 --> 30:53.587
and follow from
a distance.

30:53.630 --> 30:55.803
Simple.

30:55.850 --> 30:57.977
Why is it always
the simple ones that worry me?

31:00.640 --> 31:03.063
I don't understand places
like this.

31:03.120 --> 31:05.076
If you ask me, it's loud noise,

31:05.120 --> 31:08.078
it's crowded, there's $1000
bottles of Ukrainian vodka.

31:08.120 --> 31:10.588
Not the spot I would take you
on our first date.

31:10.650 --> 31:13.813
You seem more like a, uh,
dive bar and tequila gal.

31:13.870 --> 31:15.258
That means
I dragged you here?

31:15.300 --> 31:17.120
Hmm.

31:17.170 --> 31:18.774
We're a couple
for ten minutes,

31:18.830 --> 31:20.172
we're already
a clich, Jeff.

31:24.830 --> 31:27.481
I shouldn't have
doubted you.

31:27.530 --> 31:30.488
I don't want to be
at each other's throats forever.

31:30.540 --> 31:32.053
I want to put it to bed.

31:32.100 --> 31:33.749
Bury it.
Want to bury it?

31:33.800 --> 31:35.188
Yeah, you're pretty
good at burying things.

31:35.240 --> 31:37.925
Burying people, too.

31:37.980 --> 31:39.675
Was going to Harrington
that wrong?

31:39.720 --> 31:41.540
Like I said before,
if you had any doubts,

31:41.590 --> 31:42.841
you should have
come to me.

31:42.900 --> 31:45.460
It wasn't entirely
about doubts.

31:45.510 --> 31:47.671
Maybe I was thinking
that pulling you down here

31:47.730 --> 31:50.290
so soon after losing Alana
wasn't the best thing

31:50.340 --> 31:51.989
for you and your kids.

31:52.040 --> 31:55.646
Maybe I was thinking
about you, Jason.

31:55.690 --> 31:57.510
Well, you put it that way,

31:57.560 --> 31:59.425
makes it a lot
easrer to swallow.

31:59.480 --> 32:01.732
Then again,
you make a living

32:01.780 --> 32:04.954
telling people what
they want to hear.

32:05.010 --> 32:06.307
I don't believe you.

32:13.060 --> 32:15.278
Lazo's here.
Come on.

32:28.680 --> 32:31.808
Bravo 2 to Havoc.
Bravo 1 has eyes on HVT,

32:31.860 --> 32:33.282
who has made contact
with Cinderella.

32:33.340 --> 32:34.591
ERIC:
Good copy, Bravo 2.

32:49.790 --> 32:53.351
None of my people saw him
come through the street.

32:53.400 --> 32:55.652
Likely came up
from underground.

32:55.710 --> 32:58.099
Martinez, let's have your man
sit on the garage exits, yeah?

32:58.150 --> 32:59.447
Copy.

33:20.300 --> 33:21.642
Is he gonna
chat all night

33:21.690 --> 33:23.555
or is he gonna
close the deal?

33:23.610 --> 33:26.602
Terrorizing a country
is a stressful job.

33:26.650 --> 33:29.175
Even psychopaths
need someone to talk to.

33:37.360 --> 33:38.873
JASON: Hey, he's
taking a call.

33:54.940 --> 33:56.373
Damn it.

34:20.920 --> 34:22.478
Yeah?

34:22.530 --> 34:24.179
Do you have a lock
on Cinderella's cell?

34:24.230 --> 34:27.017
We lost her.

34:27.060 --> 34:28.277
Yeah, boss,
she's still in the club.

34:28.320 --> 34:30.185
Northwest corner
of the building.

34:30.240 --> 34:32.322
Copy.

34:32.370 --> 34:33.712
Check to see
if she's in the bathroom.

34:33.760 --> 34:35.284
We lose her,
we lose our track on Lazo.

34:35.330 --> 34:37.366
We lose Lazo, we lose Doza.

34:50.040 --> 34:51.860
What is it, boss?

34:51.910 --> 34:52.956
Got eyes on our HVT?

34:53.000 --> 34:54.217
RAY:
Negative. Watching all doors.

34:54.260 --> 34:55.818
Thinking he left
without our Cinderella.

35:53.450 --> 35:55.441
What is it?

35:55.500 --> 35:57.718
Sofia said Lazo left
to see his boss.

35:57.760 --> 35:58.977
He left to go see Doza.

35:59.020 --> 36:00.806
It's not exactly
solid intelligence.

36:00.850 --> 36:03.159
Don't have anything
else to go on here.

36:03.200 --> 36:04.588
Something's wrong.

36:10.640 --> 36:12.551
RAY:
There's Jason.

36:20.780 --> 36:22.509
Silver Mercedes, heading east.

36:22.570 --> 36:23.696
He's leaving his date?

36:23.740 --> 36:25.822
Yup. To meet Doza. Drive.

36:25.870 --> 36:27.303
MARTINEZ: This could
all end tonight.

36:27.350 --> 36:28.999
Yeah, that's right,
it could end tonight.

36:29.050 --> 36:30.529
RAY:
All elements, this is Bravo 2.

36:30.570 --> 36:31.741
We are following the HVT.

36:31.790 --> 36:32.575
Headed northbound on
Paseo de la Reforma.

36:32.620 --> 36:33.928
What the hell?

36:36.280 --> 36:37.759
I don't remember this
being part of the plan.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.676
J, following Lazo without
the girl's cell to track?

36:49.720 --> 36:51.506
There's too many unknowns.

36:51.550 --> 36:52.858
We don't know why
he left his date

36:52.900 --> 36:54.413
or how many eyes
are on him.

36:54.470 --> 36:55.983
Sitting on his bumper
is not the smartest play.

36:56.030 --> 36:57.725
It's our only one, Ray.

36:57.780 --> 36:58.986
Sit on the bumper, Trent.

36:59.040 --> 37:01.338
ERIC:
Bravo 2, this is Havoc.

37:01.390 --> 37:04.029
Interrogative;
is Cinderella with the HVT?

37:04.090 --> 37:06.388
RAY:
Negative, Havoc. He's alone.

37:06.440 --> 37:08.476
All right, good copy, Bravo 2.

37:08.530 --> 37:10.304
Maintain your distance,
keep your heads down.

37:10.350 --> 37:12.079
RAY: Roger that.We don't have the cell.

37:12.140 --> 37:13.357
You're not scrubbing the op?

37:13.400 --> 37:14.742
Jason's call.

37:14.790 --> 37:15.961
Gonna back it.

37:18.750 --> 37:19.739
What?

37:19.800 --> 37:21.188
Nobody's answering at Reyes's.

37:21.230 --> 37:23.403
We're on our way
to her apartment now.

37:23.450 --> 37:24.929
All right. Keep me posted.MANDY: Jason,

37:24.980 --> 37:27.016
I have a bad feeling.
I think we could be burned.

37:27.070 --> 37:28.458
We don't know that;
keep me posted.

37:31.370 --> 37:32.803
Hey. Where are we?

37:32.850 --> 37:35.159
Ixtapaluca, it's the biggest
slum in the city.

37:35.200 --> 37:36.724
RAY: Any idea
why Lazo would be

37:36.770 --> 37:38.374
meeting Doza in
a place like this?

37:38.430 --> 37:40.034
MARTINEZ: Yeah, Doza's smart.
He would never set up

37:40.080 --> 37:41.240
a meeting at the Four Seasons.

37:41.300 --> 37:42.688
No one would ever think
to look here.

37:45.040 --> 37:46.644
SONNY:
Bravo 3 to Bravo 1.

37:46.690 --> 37:49.158
We're passing outside our 20
minute perimeter of our QRF.

37:49.220 --> 37:51.529
Is there any reason
we don't wave this off?

37:51.570 --> 37:53.083
JASON:
Bravo 3, this is 1.

37:53.140 --> 37:54.653
Got you loud and clear.
Charlie Mike.

37:54.700 --> 37:56.964
Cont_in_ue mission?
We're Sitting cucarachas.

38:12.980 --> 38:14.368
JASON:
Bravo 3, this is 1.

38:14.420 --> 38:16.809
They split right,
down two side streets.

38:23.210 --> 38:25.337
That's not good.

38:25.390 --> 38:27.460
Havoc to all Bravo stations,
we have vehicles

38:27.520 --> 38:28.418
rapidly approaching
our position.

38:32.910 --> 38:33.911
Havoc Base, this is Bravo 6.

38:33.960 --> 38:35.348
We have troops in contact.

38:35.400 --> 38:38.301
Copy, Bravo 6.
Bravo 1, QRF is inbound.

38:38.350 --> 38:40.659
Get your guys mustered up
in five and out the damn door.

38:40.700 --> 38:42.782
Davis, I need ISR ASAP.Roger, sir.

38:45.140 --> 38:46.448
JASON:
Go through them.

38:53.150 --> 38:55.368
CLAY:
RPG!
