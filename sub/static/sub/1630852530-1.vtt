01:04.060 --> 01:07.623
- Hello.
- Are you going out?

01:07.855 --> 01:09.523
My face is puffy, right?

01:10.357 --> 01:11.776
A bit.

01:12.443 --> 01:15.321
You drank last night?
It's a bit puffy.

01:15.697 --> 01:17.883
- I did go drinking.
- With who?

01:17.907 --> 01:19.158
My friends.

01:20.451 --> 01:21.703
Really?

01:22.411 --> 01:24.080
I have a job interview today.

01:24.914 --> 01:28.042
- So that's why you're dressed up.
- Yes.

01:28.542 --> 01:29.794
You look nice.

01:32.004 --> 01:33.965
But my face is so puffy.

01:34.465 --> 01:37.802
No, it's fine.
It's not puffy.

01:38.385 --> 01:39.762
You look fine.

01:40.262 --> 01:42.223
But I'm so nervous.

01:42.640 --> 01:43.640
Really?

01:43.933 --> 01:45.977
Do your best.
You'll do well.

01:46.811 --> 01:49.689
I'll try,
but I'm not optimistic.

01:50.397 --> 01:51.649
Really?

01:53.067 --> 01:54.777
It's good to see you.

01:55.778 --> 01:57.029
Bye.

01:57.363 --> 01:58.614
See you later.

03:13.898 --> 03:13.958
Gamhee!

03:13.982 --> 03:15.149
Gamhee!

03:16.525 --> 03:17.401
Youngsoon!

03:17.484 --> 03:18.736
You really came.

03:19.153 --> 03:22.007
It's been so long.
How did you know I arrived?

03:22.031 --> 03:24.909
- There's a CCTV at home.
- Really?

03:26.243 --> 03:28.955
- Was it hard getting here?
- No, it was easy.

03:29.413 --> 03:32.059
Though I drove past the entrance.

03:32.083 --> 03:34.477
- Really?
- But it didn't take long.

03:34.501 --> 03:35.502
That's a relief.

03:35.711 --> 03:38.339
- It's pretty here.
- You cut your hair?

03:39.506 --> 03:43.177
Just a few days ago.
How does it look? Odd?

03:43.594 --> 03:46.013
It's much shorter than before.

03:46.263 --> 03:48.432
Your hair was really long.

03:48.766 --> 03:51.143
I got tired of it, so I cut it.

03:52.061 --> 03:53.980
- I did it myself.
- What?

03:54.981 --> 03:58.484
- You cut it?
- In the bathroom.

04:00.402 --> 04:03.781
Then I went to a hair salon
and had it done right.

04:04.240 --> 04:05.491
I see.

04:06.158 --> 04:08.494
You look like a flighty
high school student.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.121
Really?

04:11.622 --> 04:12.874
It's cute.

04:13.707 --> 04:14.959
You look young.

04:16.168 --> 04:17.711
I look flighty?

04:17.920 --> 04:20.882
No, it's cute.
You look so young.

04:21.215 --> 04:24.385
I brought some meat.
They said it's good.

04:25.594 --> 04:28.264
Right, you wanted meat.
Good job.

04:28.848 --> 04:32.226
- I got makgeolli, too.
- You brought alcohol?

04:32.559 --> 04:34.311
I can't drink.

04:35.187 --> 04:37.064
Anyway, good job.

04:47.199 --> 04:49.410
Do you like meeting up
with people?

04:52.121 --> 04:54.123
That's what everyone does.

04:55.249 --> 04:56.500
It's needed.

04:58.169 --> 05:00.379
I used to meet people often.

05:01.713 --> 05:04.341
It does make you tired.

05:07.094 --> 05:08.888
I don't want to see anyone.

05:11.473 --> 05:12.934
When I do,

05:15.019 --> 05:20.042
I say things I don't need to say,
and do things I don't need to do,

05:20.066 --> 05:21.317
I'm sick of it.

05:21.943 --> 05:23.360
You've changed.

05:24.820 --> 05:26.447
I guess so.

05:38.584 --> 05:44.090
When is your roommate coming?
We need to grill the meat.

05:44.548 --> 05:48.344
A bit late, in about an hour.

05:48.677 --> 05:49.720
You're hungry?

05:50.387 --> 05:54.391
A bit, and I'm craving meat.

05:56.685 --> 06:00.999
She grills really well,
like a pro.

06:01.023 --> 06:02.709
- Really?
- It'll be tasty.

06:02.733 --> 06:05.111
- Great.
- She's really good.

06:10.199 --> 06:13.160
But how did you end up here?

06:13.535 --> 06:15.329
Did you buy or rent it?

06:16.956 --> 06:18.207
I bought it.

06:20.667 --> 06:25.881
With the money from
the divorce, and a loan.

06:30.802 --> 06:32.429
It's so nice here.

06:32.638 --> 06:37.643
With that gorgeous mountain,
and the birdsong.

06:38.810 --> 06:40.062
It's great.

06:40.812 --> 06:42.982
I want a place like this.

06:46.110 --> 06:50.114
It's so remote,
it's hard to get around.

06:50.614 --> 06:53.492
I only go out when I have to.

06:57.204 --> 06:58.455
So,

07:00.082 --> 07:04.295
what is he doing, your ex?
Are you in touch?

07:05.546 --> 07:08.882
No, why stay in touch?

07:10.134 --> 07:13.554
- Splitting up was so hard.
- Is he still working?

07:14.180 --> 07:17.933
Sure.
More than before, I think.

07:18.684 --> 07:22.438
Still writing plays,
and directing.

07:23.564 --> 07:27.359
He deserves to fail, doesn't he?

07:29.570 --> 07:32.323
It may yet happen.

07:35.451 --> 07:37.578
How are things
with your husband?

07:38.287 --> 07:40.456
We're always together.

07:42.499 --> 07:44.501
We've never been apart.

07:45.086 --> 07:48.255
- Really?
- Yes, this is the first time.

07:49.673 --> 07:53.320
It's just a short trip,
so I didn't join him.

07:53.344 --> 07:55.179
The first time in 5 years.

07:57.139 --> 07:59.451
You've never been apart
in 5 years?

07:59.475 --> 08:04.438
Not once.
Not for a single day.

08:07.858 --> 08:09.961
That's what he wants.

08:09.985 --> 08:13.905
He says people in love should
always stick to each other.

08:18.035 --> 08:19.953
You two are amazing.

08:22.373 --> 08:25.709
I guess we're very compatible.

08:26.085 --> 08:30.547
We manage to have
good moments every day.

08:33.384 --> 08:34.635
Is that so?

08:37.638 --> 08:39.348
But I don't know...

08:40.224 --> 08:42.976
I really need time to myself.

08:44.395 --> 08:47.273
It was hard seeing someone
every day.

08:48.565 --> 08:53.237
For me, spending all day
with someone is unbearable.

09:00.952 --> 09:05.624
My husband thinks
you're a really good person.

09:06.458 --> 09:08.585
That's why I came.

09:10.712 --> 09:11.963
Really?

09:12.173 --> 09:16.093
There aren't many people
around me he likes.

09:18.387 --> 09:23.160
Of course I really like you,
but that's good too.

09:23.184 --> 09:26.978
When I tell him I saw you,
he'll be so happy.

09:38.740 --> 09:40.784
You really love meat.

09:41.660 --> 09:45.831
I didn't used to,
but these days I like it.

09:46.457 --> 09:49.042
It's another thing
that changed with age.

09:52.087 --> 09:53.880
You don't like meat?

09:54.756 --> 09:56.967
I like it.

09:58.969 --> 10:02.223
- But you're not eating much.
- I'm eating.

10:04.433 --> 10:09.789
Youngji, come eat.
I feel bad that we're eating alone.

10:09.813 --> 10:11.898
Yes, I will.

10:12.983 --> 10:17.255
You bought really nice meat.
It's delicious.

10:17.279 --> 10:21.200
- Isn't it?
- Yes, it's high quality.

10:21.367 --> 10:23.660
She loves meat.

10:23.744 --> 10:27.164
If you let her,
she'd eat everything here.

10:29.625 --> 10:32.645
Living with me,

10:32.669 --> 10:36.632
she can't eat meat,
since I don't eat it.

10:37.508 --> 10:40.927
Yes, I'm so happy today!

10:42.638 --> 10:46.743
You grill it so well,
this is delicious.

10:46.767 --> 10:50.562
No, it's just really
high quality meat.

10:54.608 --> 10:57.903
I wanted to become vegetarian.

10:58.820 --> 11:00.406
I still do.

11:01.323 --> 11:03.385
Really? Me, too.

11:03.409 --> 11:04.660
Really?

11:06.703 --> 11:09.956
Yes, seeing cows
makes me so sad.

11:11.458 --> 11:13.335
Yes, you're right.

11:14.044 --> 11:15.980
Aren't their eyes beautiful?

11:16.004 --> 11:18.358
Once I went to the country,

11:18.382 --> 11:21.510
and I saw some calves
running in a field.

11:23.220 --> 11:27.808
There was a newborn,
it didn't even know what it was,

11:28.225 --> 11:34.332
and it was so beautiful,
those eyes, all black,

11:34.356 --> 11:36.608
were just beautiful.

11:36.900 --> 11:40.547
The most beautiful eyes
in the world, among animals.

11:40.571 --> 11:43.073
More beautiful than humans, too.

11:43.907 --> 11:47.411
- They're beautiful animals.
- Right.

11:49.871 --> 11:54.293
Our minds and bodies
are totally separate.

11:54.335 --> 12:02.335
I mean, our consciousness
can easily interact with cows.

12:02.884 --> 12:06.930
But our bodies
don't care in the least.

12:07.222 --> 12:09.641
They're just ruled by instinct.

12:10.100 --> 12:12.978
- That's what makes things hard.
- Right.

12:17.733 --> 12:20.235
I think I can give up meat now.

12:21.194 --> 12:23.322
Just eat it.

12:24.406 --> 12:26.700
If your body craves it,
go ahead.

12:27.368 --> 12:31.037
It feels good to have
this consciousness,

12:32.122 --> 12:37.961
but I'm not sure if cows
can feel that.

12:41.006 --> 12:42.048
Let's eat!

12:52.017 --> 12:56.456
Sorry.
I'm slow by nature.

12:56.480 --> 12:59.316
Not at all, thank you.

13:00.359 --> 13:03.570
- Is the coffee okay?
- Yes, it's good.

13:04.446 --> 13:07.741
I worried it might be too weak.

13:08.909 --> 13:12.496
She doesn't like strong coffee.

13:13.580 --> 13:17.083
- This is perfect for me.
- Really? All right, then.

13:27.844 --> 13:28.863
Enjoy.

13:28.887 --> 13:30.472
Thank you.

13:35.727 --> 13:36.978
Thank you.

13:37.979 --> 13:39.230
It's great.

13:39.523 --> 13:40.774
That's good.

13:41.149 --> 13:45.713
Thanks to you, we had so much meat,
and so much alcohol.

13:45.737 --> 13:47.614
- That's good.
- Is it good?

13:48.865 --> 13:52.118
Your face isn't as flushed
as it was before.

13:52.536 --> 13:56.873
My face gets so red,
I don't usually drink.

13:57.791 --> 14:00.126
I must have been
happy to see you.

14:01.712 --> 14:04.715
You've been close
for a long time?

14:04.965 --> 14:07.468
Yes, we've been close.

14:08.343 --> 14:09.928
Have we?

14:11.597 --> 14:14.140
But I guess you haven't
drank together.

14:14.391 --> 14:17.894
I don't think we have.

14:18.437 --> 14:24.377
Back then, we didn't
really drink together.

14:24.401 --> 14:25.652
Right.

14:27.362 --> 14:30.007
Next time, we'll treat you.

14:30.031 --> 14:33.803
If you tell me
what you want to eat,

14:33.827 --> 14:35.888
we'll prepare it ahead for you.

14:35.912 --> 14:40.501
No, this was delicious.
You went to so much trouble.

14:40.751 --> 14:43.920
We're so far away,
it's not easy getting here.

14:44.421 --> 14:46.172
Still, it's great.

14:46.339 --> 14:48.359
It's like the countryside.

14:48.383 --> 14:53.054
The air is nice and
I can hear the chickens.

14:53.472 --> 14:56.642
- You hear the chickens?
- I heard them before.

14:57.225 --> 14:58.852
So you heard them.

14:59.728 --> 15:02.689
The two of you raise chickens?

15:03.106 --> 15:04.459
No.

15:04.483 --> 15:07.903
It's not us, it's our neighbor.

15:08.654 --> 15:14.301
Our plot borders on theirs.
The coop is above their plot.

15:14.325 --> 15:15.577
It's not our land.

15:16.286 --> 15:17.538
I see.

15:18.830 --> 15:21.667
But they must crow
every morning.

15:22.501 --> 15:25.420
You wouldn't believe it.
He's so loud.

15:26.379 --> 15:31.760
But those chickens...
it's a bit horrible.

15:32.761 --> 15:33.988
Really?

15:34.012 --> 15:39.309
There's a rooster there.
But he's so mean.

15:39.976 --> 15:40.976
Why?

15:41.144 --> 15:44.999
Every day he climbs up
on the backs of the hens.

15:45.023 --> 15:51.297
Then he pecks at
the back of their necks.

15:51.321 --> 15:56.201
If you look closely,
the hens have no feathers there.

15:56.409 --> 15:58.345
He must be trying to mate.

15:58.369 --> 16:02.082
It's not that,
he's just doing it for show.

16:02.373 --> 16:09.089
He does it on purpose to prove
he's the strongest.

16:09.840 --> 16:11.842
He's so mean.

16:14.094 --> 16:16.614
Wow.
He really is mean.

16:16.638 --> 16:18.324
So if you go up close,

16:18.348 --> 16:22.310
they have
no feathers there at all.

16:23.228 --> 16:24.395
Really.

16:25.772 --> 16:27.148
It's horrible.

16:30.193 --> 16:31.737
Just a minute.

16:37.993 --> 16:39.578
- Hello?
- Hello.

16:39.953 --> 16:43.558
- I moved in next door.
- I see.

16:43.582 --> 16:46.627
- I have a favor to ask.
- What is it?

16:47.043 --> 16:49.814
It's my first time
seeing you, right?

16:49.838 --> 16:52.007
Yes, I think so.

16:53.341 --> 16:56.136
Are you feeding those cats?

16:56.595 --> 16:59.055
They're strays, robber cats?

16:59.222 --> 17:00.766
Well...

17:03.351 --> 17:07.331
I'm not sure if they're robber cats,
but we feed them.

17:07.355 --> 17:11.085
They call them robber cats
for a reason, right?

17:11.109 --> 17:12.152
Right.

17:16.156 --> 17:21.929
Because you feed them,
the cats keep coming here.

17:21.953 --> 17:23.038
Yes...

17:23.622 --> 17:26.976
So actually it makes us
very uncomfortable.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.920
It's uncomfortable?
I'm sorry.

17:31.630 --> 17:38.344
But I'm not sure what we can do.

17:40.263 --> 17:42.057
It's an important matter.

17:43.308 --> 17:46.078
- My wife is very sensitive.
- Is she?

17:46.102 --> 17:48.021
She's very scared of cats.

17:50.148 --> 17:55.236
So, she's scared to come out
in the yard.

17:56.613 --> 17:58.007
I see.

17:58.031 --> 18:01.052
It's absurd not being
able to come outside.

18:01.076 --> 18:02.202
Sure.

18:02.786 --> 18:07.207
It's a real shame
she's scared of cats.

18:08.583 --> 18:16.466
Still, these cats have to survive.
It's an important matter.

18:18.218 --> 18:23.598
That's true,
but people come first.

18:24.474 --> 18:28.436
We shouldn't encourage
these robber cats to come in, right?

18:29.479 --> 18:31.564
Yes, people are important.

18:31.773 --> 18:37.278
But it's very important
for these cats to eat.

18:37.445 --> 18:41.241
So that's why I feed them.

18:41.783 --> 18:43.744
I'm sorry.

18:45.036 --> 18:47.914
But they're not people.

18:48.414 --> 18:50.458
Neighbors are
more important, right?

18:50.541 --> 18:52.794
Right, neighbors are important.

18:53.003 --> 18:55.106
They're important,

18:55.130 --> 18:59.550
and it's just as important
for cats to eat.

19:01.344 --> 19:02.721
I'm sorry.

19:03.138 --> 19:04.389
What to do?

19:05.682 --> 19:08.601
Well, can't you do anything?

19:09.144 --> 19:15.084
You call them robber cats,
but actually to us,

19:15.108 --> 19:17.044
they're like children.

19:17.068 --> 19:19.130
That's why we feed them.

19:19.154 --> 19:21.281
But they're not kids.

19:21.990 --> 19:25.786
But we think of them that way.

19:26.077 --> 19:28.955
You call them robber cats,

19:29.330 --> 19:33.668
but you've never seen them
steal anything, have you?

19:34.544 --> 19:41.634
We think of them as children,
so we feed them every day.

19:44.179 --> 19:46.139
I'm sorry.

19:49.893 --> 19:51.144
Is something wrong?

19:51.937 --> 19:54.815
They've just moved in.

19:55.065 --> 19:58.026
They're scared of cats,

19:58.234 --> 20:02.155
so they're asking us
not to feed them.

20:03.406 --> 20:05.491
- Hello.
- Hello.

20:05.616 --> 20:07.911
Do you have to feed them?

20:08.286 --> 20:12.415
Yes, we intend to.
Why?

20:13.166 --> 20:14.417
Really?

20:14.625 --> 20:17.128
As long as it's not
against the law.

20:20.924 --> 20:23.820
There must be
a residents' council here?

20:23.844 --> 20:27.097
Very well then.
Have a nice day.

20:36.647 --> 20:37.899
Go in, it's cold.

20:44.823 --> 20:46.342
Wait a minute.

20:46.366 --> 20:48.576
We'll get you some food.

21:32.412 --> 21:33.663
Can't sleep?

21:34.873 --> 21:37.667
Use this.
It's cold at night.

21:40.045 --> 21:41.045
What is it?

21:41.922 --> 21:45.008
Who is that?
She's so scary.

21:45.300 --> 21:48.719
She's a neighbor's daughter.

21:49.429 --> 21:50.680
Really?

21:51.306 --> 21:53.349
What's she doing late at night?

21:54.100 --> 21:56.102
Sometimes she smokes here.

21:56.519 --> 22:00.207
Her father's a bit scary,
so she comes here.

22:00.231 --> 22:03.944
Sneaking around
late at night, it's creepy.

22:06.279 --> 22:08.073
Her mom ran off.

22:09.407 --> 22:11.076
So it's hard for her.

22:12.410 --> 22:14.745
Her mom ran off and left her?

22:16.039 --> 22:17.415
How did she run off?

22:18.499 --> 22:23.629
She just left at night,
and didn't come back.

22:25.840 --> 22:28.051
She's missing?
Out of contact?

22:29.052 --> 22:30.303
Right.

22:31.721 --> 22:33.764
She lives with her father,

22:34.432 --> 22:37.643
but he's not
coping with it well.

22:40.021 --> 22:41.439
How old is she?

22:43.149 --> 22:45.818
Twenty-six?

22:46.402 --> 22:47.820
You know her age.

22:48.821 --> 22:51.657
Sometimes we smoke
together and talk.

22:55.078 --> 22:57.080
She had a job interview today.

23:04.170 --> 23:06.756
I better go see her.

23:07.966 --> 23:09.217
Go to sleep.

23:09.926 --> 23:10.926
Okay.

24:30.381 --> 24:33.176
Sleep some more.
Why are you awake?

24:34.260 --> 24:35.595
What are you doing?

24:36.512 --> 24:37.972
I went to the bathroom.

24:38.723 --> 24:39.890
Really?

24:40.100 --> 24:43.144
As I get older, I go more often.

24:45.313 --> 24:47.440
What's the secret
of the 3rd floor?

24:52.778 --> 24:53.778
What?

24:54.780 --> 24:56.949
The secret of the 3rd floor.

24:59.410 --> 25:01.704
What secret?

25:02.830 --> 25:05.666
Then why is the 3rd floor
blocked off?

25:08.294 --> 25:10.421
Because it's so dirty.

25:11.464 --> 25:13.549
I don't think so.

25:15.051 --> 25:16.761
You don't trust me?

25:19.139 --> 25:21.891
Of course I trust you.

25:22.850 --> 25:25.353
Then why is the
3rd floor blocked off?

25:26.937 --> 25:30.358
Sorry, it's just too dirty.

25:30.775 --> 25:32.610
Don't get any wrong ideas.

25:38.616 --> 25:39.867
All right, then.

25:41.244 --> 25:42.662
Go back to sleep.

30:29.114 --> 30:32.260
I bought this for me,
but I think it will fit you.

30:32.284 --> 30:36.246
It's oversized.
It'll look good on you.

30:37.206 --> 30:38.874
This is my favorite brand.

30:39.249 --> 30:42.420
It was great when
Grenier was still there.

30:42.503 --> 30:46.006
- Now their designs have changed.
- You're right.

30:46.591 --> 30:49.510
- This is his design?
- Yeah, it's his.

30:50.553 --> 30:51.804
How does it look?

30:57.893 --> 30:59.479
- It's nice.
- Is it?

31:00.730 --> 31:02.565
It fits well.

31:03.941 --> 31:05.693
It's perfect for me.

31:07.236 --> 31:11.073
- It doesn't suit you?
- It looks better on you.

31:11.491 --> 31:15.119
And the color goes well
with your face.

31:16.579 --> 31:17.830
Thanks.

31:18.914 --> 31:20.684
Want more coffee?

31:20.708 --> 31:22.853
No, that's enough.

31:22.877 --> 31:25.045
Too much coffee makes me tired.

31:25.463 --> 31:27.507
Right, I remember.

31:36.390 --> 31:39.059
The mountain here is incredible.

31:40.019 --> 31:41.395
Which mountain is it?

31:41.687 --> 31:42.938
Mt. Inwang.

31:43.397 --> 31:44.982
- Impressive, right?
- Yeah.

31:45.315 --> 31:47.359
The first time I came here,

31:48.193 --> 31:53.616
that mountain in the window
was like an old painting.

31:54.825 --> 31:57.870
You know the painting I mean.

31:58.412 --> 31:59.914
What was his name?

32:02.207 --> 32:05.545
The person who painted
"Mt. Inwang After the Rain".

32:07.922 --> 32:09.339
What was his name?

32:11.884 --> 32:15.471
Why can't I remember names?

32:16.764 --> 32:18.283
He's really famous.

32:18.307 --> 32:20.601
- Jeong Seon!
- Yes, that's right.

32:22.895 --> 32:24.480
It's so frustrating.

32:25.397 --> 32:28.192
These days I can't remember
anyone's name.

32:28.818 --> 32:30.069
You too?

32:30.402 --> 32:32.881
I just can't remember anything.

32:32.905 --> 32:35.926
You know fish oil?
Try that.

32:35.950 --> 32:38.929
They say it helps with memory.

32:38.953 --> 32:41.121
I'm already taking it.

32:41.747 --> 32:44.083
But it's not helping.

32:45.084 --> 32:47.169
It's really serious.

32:48.963 --> 32:51.090
We need to take care
of ourselves.

32:52.925 --> 32:56.637
The design of
this place is great.

32:57.387 --> 33:00.808
Like a proper architect
designed it.

33:01.308 --> 33:02.560
I think so.

33:02.935 --> 33:05.479
I saw the upstairs, too.

33:06.146 --> 33:08.232
It's really nice.

33:09.274 --> 33:11.401
I was so lucky.

33:11.777 --> 33:16.550
The Jeonse deposit is $500,000.
But I got a $100,000 discount.

33:16.574 --> 33:17.574
Really?

33:17.658 --> 33:21.161
Who heard of
a $100,000 discount?

33:22.580 --> 33:28.293
So at first I thought
the landlord was scamming me.

33:30.254 --> 33:31.023
But no.

33:31.047 --> 33:33.090
Really?
Why'd he do it?

33:34.174 --> 33:36.510
The landlord lives upstairs,

33:38.596 --> 33:42.701
and I think he likes artists.

33:42.725 --> 33:45.370
So he rents to artistic people.

33:45.394 --> 33:48.272
Then how'd you get in?

33:48.313 --> 33:50.816
I still produce
dance performances.

33:51.942 --> 33:54.671
You didn't know?

33:54.695 --> 33:58.365
No, I didn't.
You're still doing that?

33:59.324 --> 34:00.576
Not often.

34:00.868 --> 34:06.999
Once every two or three years...

34:07.291 --> 34:10.711
You were really fortunate.
Saving $100,000?

34:11.503 --> 34:13.964
Different from your last place.

34:14.924 --> 34:16.175
It's so nice.

34:17.051 --> 34:19.637
I want to live in
a place like this.

34:21.388 --> 34:23.599
It's nice.

34:24.433 --> 34:29.706
Actually it's smarter to buy
an apartment.

34:29.730 --> 34:32.399
The prices on these
type of homes don't go up.

34:32.983 --> 34:35.945
But I like this neighborhood.

34:36.361 --> 34:39.489
So I'm happy.

34:40.074 --> 34:42.242
I lived with my mom so long.

34:42.451 --> 34:45.830
It was a long time.

34:46.371 --> 34:47.623
You did well.

34:48.332 --> 34:49.583
You did well.

34:54.171 --> 34:56.423
It's great, the mountain.

34:57.174 --> 35:02.346
With such a discount,
I had to take it.

35:02.429 --> 35:06.308
Then are you still
teaching Pilates?

35:06.350 --> 35:08.894
Sure, that's my income.

35:09.311 --> 35:12.564
Do a lot of people sign up?

35:13.190 --> 35:14.441
Not bad.

35:15.067 --> 35:17.820
More than before, actually.

35:18.195 --> 35:20.239
Then you're all set.

35:22.157 --> 35:25.410
Things are good.
I'm saving, too.

35:26.036 --> 35:28.247
I'm going to save $1 million.

35:30.666 --> 35:31.959
Seriously?

35:33.085 --> 35:34.336
You're amazing.

35:34.670 --> 35:37.506
I've been teaching a long time.

35:39.049 --> 35:43.178
Now I can buy whatever I want.

35:43.888 --> 35:48.058
Good for you,
saving so much money.

35:49.351 --> 35:51.788
That includes
the Jeonse deposit?

35:51.812 --> 35:53.689
Of course.

35:55.315 --> 36:01.280
Really, you're amazing.

36:02.114 --> 36:05.409
I want to have fun.

36:07.286 --> 36:09.914
I've always held myself back.

36:11.707 --> 36:13.542
That's why I moved here.

36:13.959 --> 36:17.963
You did well.
Your home is nice.

36:18.338 --> 36:20.233
The area's fun, too.

36:20.257 --> 36:22.718
It's a fun neighborhood.

36:23.052 --> 36:26.263
Lots of nice houses
and good restaurants.

36:26.430 --> 36:27.657
Right.

36:27.681 --> 36:31.143
I found an interesting bar, too.

36:31.268 --> 36:32.978
It's really nice.

36:33.312 --> 36:35.314
- A bar?
- Yeah.

36:36.023 --> 36:38.901
I'm thinking of
going more often.

36:39.401 --> 36:44.614
Lots of regulars there,
most of them artists.

36:44.865 --> 36:50.096
Film directors, writers,
novelists,

36:50.120 --> 36:55.584
and architects...
people like that.

36:56.418 --> 37:02.049
Every day they get together
and sing or whatever,

37:02.549 --> 37:04.176
it looks fun.

37:04.343 --> 37:06.720
I see. Is it far?

37:07.221 --> 37:10.682
It's close. 15 minutes?

37:11.851 --> 37:15.538
I'm thinking of becoming
a regular there.

37:15.562 --> 37:16.814
Sounds good.

37:19.691 --> 37:21.401
Is something burning?

37:22.444 --> 37:24.130
Oh no!

37:24.154 --> 37:25.154
Oh my god.

37:57.271 --> 37:58.438
Is it okay?

38:03.986 --> 38:05.237
Is it okay?

38:05.529 --> 38:08.198
Yeah, it's fine!

38:30.846 --> 38:32.722
You're eating a lot.

38:33.057 --> 38:34.516
It's delicious.

38:34.850 --> 38:36.268
I'm told it's no good.

38:36.601 --> 38:39.521
- Says who?
- Someone I know.

38:40.605 --> 38:43.901
I'm a bad cook, like my mom.

38:44.359 --> 38:48.864
She can only make things
salty or spicy.

38:49.448 --> 38:50.449
Really?

38:51.616 --> 38:53.285
Who says it's no good?

38:53.869 --> 38:55.871
I wish I could cook.

38:56.371 --> 38:57.622
It's tasty.

38:58.623 --> 39:00.834
No it's not.
Just eat.

39:02.294 --> 39:03.545
I ate it all.

39:20.645 --> 39:21.897
It was good.

39:22.772 --> 39:25.067
Thank you, for enjoying it.

39:25.650 --> 39:29.571
And I really love
the clothes, too.

39:29.947 --> 39:32.383
It really suits you.

39:32.407 --> 39:33.658
- Really?
- Yes.

39:34.952 --> 39:36.870
Will your husband be gone long?

39:37.412 --> 39:39.373
Just a few days.

39:40.374 --> 39:43.043
We've never been apart
until now.

39:44.003 --> 39:45.254
Surprised?

39:46.255 --> 39:48.215
Why not?

39:49.049 --> 39:53.345
In 5 years we've
never once been apart.

39:54.346 --> 39:58.600
- Amazing, right?
- How can that be?

39:58.934 --> 40:00.644
It's what he wants.

40:01.020 --> 40:06.108
He says people in love
should stick to each other.

40:07.192 --> 40:09.694
- It's natural, he says.
- That's nice.

40:10.946 --> 40:13.323
Some people are like that.

40:17.744 --> 40:20.956
Do you really love your husband?

40:21.999 --> 40:23.250
Me?

40:24.043 --> 40:25.752
I don't know.

40:26.336 --> 40:30.966
It's not something
you can prove.

40:31.925 --> 40:39.925
But if I feel some love each day,
I think it's enough.

40:41.143 --> 40:43.853
- You think so?
- Yes, I do.

40:44.021 --> 40:48.876
I feel it each day.
Wow, it's love.

40:48.900 --> 40:52.862
This is what it's like
to be loved.

40:56.241 --> 40:58.202
You're really fortunate.

40:58.910 --> 41:01.121
I think so.

41:03.832 --> 41:08.087
But there are so few
decent guys.

41:09.546 --> 41:13.651
And Koreans... my god.

41:13.675 --> 41:14.884
It's pretty bad.

41:16.386 --> 41:18.347
So hard to find.

41:23.310 --> 41:25.437
Everyone has a match somewhere.

41:40.369 --> 41:42.996
I met a man recently.

41:44.414 --> 41:47.959
- At that bar.
- The place you mentioned?

41:49.378 --> 41:55.175
Not long ago, I stopped by
and met him then.

41:55.675 --> 41:58.928
On my first visit to the bar.

42:00.264 --> 42:01.264
Really?

42:02.015 --> 42:04.434
Who is he?

42:07.771 --> 42:10.232
He's gentle-looking,

42:11.066 --> 42:12.567
an architect.

42:13.777 --> 42:17.781
He looks gentle,
and he's really thoughtful.

42:18.157 --> 42:19.199
Really?

42:20.700 --> 42:22.494
You know what's funny?

42:24.496 --> 42:26.915
He lives on
the second floor here.

42:27.416 --> 42:29.102
- Isn't it funny?
- Really?

42:29.126 --> 42:30.126
Yeah.

42:30.460 --> 42:33.981
You didn't know it,
when you met him?

42:34.005 --> 42:36.966
No, I'd never seen him.

42:37.301 --> 42:39.594
I haven't lived here long.

42:40.137 --> 42:43.640
Anyway, we left the bar,

42:43.932 --> 42:48.621
started walking, and kept
going in the same direction.

42:48.645 --> 42:50.439
All the way here.

42:51.022 --> 42:56.778
It was so funny,
both of us in front of the house.

42:57.946 --> 43:01.092
- He's just upstairs.
- That's so funny.

43:01.116 --> 43:03.618
How could that be?

43:04.744 --> 43:06.455
But he's married.

43:07.997 --> 43:10.834
Well, separated
but still married.

43:11.960 --> 43:15.964
It's okay,
they're almost divorced.

43:18.217 --> 43:22.554
Did he design this house?

43:23.888 --> 43:28.977
I don't know, I doubt it.
He just rents the place.

43:29.436 --> 43:31.688
Did he get
the $100,000 discount?

43:32.105 --> 43:34.149
I didn't ask.

43:34.858 --> 43:37.068
- I doubt it.
- Really?

43:39.363 --> 43:41.531
He's separated?

43:41.823 --> 43:43.074
Yes.

43:43.950 --> 43:45.660
He lives alone.

43:47.746 --> 43:53.627
These days I'm producing
a dance performance.

43:53.835 --> 43:58.882
He volunteered to do
the stage art, so I said yes.

43:59.508 --> 44:02.903
He'll do well, he's talented.

44:02.927 --> 44:05.013
Very intelligent.

44:05.264 --> 44:07.266
Must be fun doing that.

44:07.849 --> 44:11.561
Without it, I get burned out.

44:12.312 --> 44:14.856
I need something.

44:15.148 --> 44:17.234
That must be exciting.

44:18.443 --> 44:24.533
I want something like that.
I've too many interests.

44:25.325 --> 44:28.287
It's hard to settle on one.

44:29.954 --> 44:32.582
But you have
a flower shop, right?

44:33.292 --> 44:34.543
It's boring.

44:36.670 --> 44:38.588
Hardly any customers.

44:39.172 --> 44:44.279
It's a quiet area, but a clothes shop
next to me does well.

44:44.303 --> 44:48.014
In the flower shop,
there's no work.

44:49.140 --> 44:51.768
I like flowers, but...

44:53.478 --> 44:59.984
Well, it's not like you
need to support yourself.

45:41.776 --> 45:45.489
Why do you keep coming here?
It's not normal.

45:45.697 --> 45:51.119
I was just out for a walk,
and thought I'd stop by.

45:52.746 --> 45:55.808
You're not answering your phone?

45:55.832 --> 45:57.834
Guess I missed the call.

46:00.169 --> 46:02.964
Are you a stalker?

46:03.548 --> 46:06.486
What do you mean, stalker?

46:06.510 --> 46:09.280
Stalker, stalker.
Don't you understand?

46:09.304 --> 46:12.098
I'm just...

46:13.767 --> 46:19.564
Can we talk inside for a minute?

46:23.151 --> 46:27.196
You really don't get it, do you?

46:28.365 --> 46:33.388
Why should you
come into my home?

46:33.412 --> 46:35.955
You're really out of line.

46:37.957 --> 46:42.170
Can't we talk inside?
It'll just take a minute.

46:42.421 --> 46:45.131
Why? Are you cold?

46:45.715 --> 46:52.389
A warm room and a warm body
would be so nice now, right?

46:52.806 --> 46:55.975
But guess what?
It's not going to happen.

46:59.938 --> 47:06.445
Can you stop humiliating me?
Treat me like a human being?

47:07.153 --> 47:08.905
I'm a human, too.

47:09.656 --> 47:13.702
I need some more time,
even if we break up.

47:15.203 --> 47:19.416
If you just push me away,
what am I supposed to do?

47:26.005 --> 47:28.132
I keep thinking of you.

47:31.010 --> 47:35.932
I can't control my feelings,
so what should I do?

47:37.183 --> 47:41.020
You should at least take
some responsibility.

47:48.403 --> 47:52.323
Aren't you willing to help?

47:53.575 --> 47:57.662
Are you really that cruel?

47:58.287 --> 47:59.914
You're insane.

48:01.374 --> 48:03.460
You think we're dating?

48:04.461 --> 48:08.399
Why should you mean
anything to me?

48:08.423 --> 48:11.635
Get a grip, you fucking...

48:15.805 --> 48:17.932
Keep going.

48:20.477 --> 48:25.023
I'll take it, like last time.

48:25.314 --> 48:29.611
Scream your heart out,
get furious, treat me like dirt.

48:30.945 --> 48:33.173
Humiliate me, go ahead!

48:33.197 --> 48:36.010
I humiliated you? When?

48:36.034 --> 48:37.720
You humiliated me!

48:37.744 --> 48:39.621
I humiliated you?

48:40.413 --> 48:43.792
But, what did I do wrong?

48:44.626 --> 48:47.378
Just go away. Go!

48:47.837 --> 48:50.048
Don't show up here like a creep.

48:50.674 --> 48:53.468
You humiliated me!

49:25.208 --> 49:29.396
This young poet keeps coming.
He's crazy.

49:29.420 --> 49:30.589
Really?

49:30.797 --> 49:33.358
He's young, but so rigid.

49:33.382 --> 49:35.402
I see.

49:35.426 --> 49:37.738
He's young, but so inflexible.

49:37.762 --> 49:38.823
Young?

49:38.847 --> 49:42.117
Really young.
Only twenty-six.

49:42.141 --> 49:45.019
He's a baby!

49:46.980 --> 49:50.149
It's no laughing matter.

49:50.650 --> 49:51.943
Sorry.

49:52.318 --> 49:56.573
But what happened
between you two?

49:57.657 --> 50:01.160
I ended up
sleeping with him once.

50:02.411 --> 50:04.139
I was drunk.

50:04.163 --> 50:05.665
You slept with him?

50:06.124 --> 50:09.460
He came here late at night,
calling me.

50:09.794 --> 50:14.215
I was really drunk, and annoyed.

50:14.966 --> 50:18.302
I thought about it,
then just did it.

50:20.138 --> 50:22.199
It was a big mistake.

50:22.223 --> 50:23.558
Right.

50:24.934 --> 50:30.439
But I met him at that bar.
That's the problem.

50:30.732 --> 50:32.108
It could be.

50:32.651 --> 50:36.171
He goes to that bar often,

50:36.195 --> 50:42.427
but if he ends up talking
to the guy who lives upstairs,

50:42.451 --> 50:46.473
it could be bad, so I'm worried.

50:46.497 --> 50:48.291
I can see why.

50:51.628 --> 50:57.508
Why did I sleep with him?
I must be crazy.

50:58.802 --> 51:01.488
It's okay.

51:01.512 --> 51:04.515
No, he's a mental case.

51:04.974 --> 51:11.731
He's a poet, but he talks so much,
especially when he's drunk.

51:14.525 --> 51:19.072
Crazy fool,
why did he come that night?

51:20.239 --> 51:23.761
Still, you seem to be
living a fun life.

51:23.785 --> 51:25.954
No fun at all, it's exhausting!

51:26.579 --> 51:28.623
It looks fun.

51:29.082 --> 51:34.337
It's no good living
this way at my age.

51:37.423 --> 51:39.258
I'm going to wash my face.

51:40.009 --> 51:42.011
Oh, me too.

51:42.095 --> 51:43.930
Do it after me.

51:45.389 --> 51:48.685
Suyoung, you'll be fine.

51:49.978 --> 51:51.730
I'm going crazy!

51:55.900 --> 51:57.485
You'll be fine!

51:58.695 --> 52:00.881
Thanks for believing in me.

52:00.905 --> 52:03.825
I do!
You'll get through this.

52:04.158 --> 52:05.451
Okay.

52:46.325 --> 52:49.078
- Goodbye!
- Bye!

52:50.747 --> 52:53.207
- Sorry for my cooking.
- Go on in.

52:54.542 --> 52:57.045
- I'll see you.
- Bye!

53:58.522 --> 53:59.648
Woojin.

54:01.650 --> 54:03.069
This is from yesterday.

54:03.152 --> 54:04.487
Why give it to me?

54:05.613 --> 54:06.924
You keep it.

54:06.948 --> 54:08.366
- Me?
- Yeah.

54:09.492 --> 54:10.492
Okay.

54:10.785 --> 54:13.013
Are people arriving already?

54:13.037 --> 54:16.641
Yeah, a bit.
Tomorrow should be full.

54:16.665 --> 54:18.251
I think so.

54:18.918 --> 54:21.880
- Did you go downstairs?
- I did.

54:22.255 --> 54:25.466
Mr. Jung seems really
popular these days.

54:27.802 --> 54:29.512
Are you happy?

54:30.096 --> 54:32.932
Why should I be happy?

54:33.766 --> 54:37.662
Still, he's your husband,
you must be happy.

54:37.686 --> 54:40.481
I have no wish
for him to be famous.

54:40.815 --> 54:44.318
He should just focus
on what he's good at.

54:45.236 --> 54:47.113
He published a lot of books.

54:47.280 --> 54:50.867
He did. Too many.

54:54.578 --> 54:59.184
I don't know.
Do I have an inferiority complex?

54:59.208 --> 55:01.210
Ah...

55:02.378 --> 55:03.963
I'm tired.

55:05.673 --> 55:08.968
Do your best today.

55:09.260 --> 55:14.390
Thanks,
but Mr. Jung's so smart,

55:14.933 --> 55:16.559
I'm intimidated.

55:16.725 --> 55:19.955
Don't worry,
you don't have to do much.

55:19.979 --> 55:23.774
Just remember
the list of questions.

55:24.150 --> 55:25.860
Yes.

55:27.153 --> 55:30.489
Is it cold in the basement?

55:30.949 --> 55:33.659
It's warmed up, it's fine.

55:33.826 --> 55:35.161
Okay.

55:35.619 --> 55:37.538
Then I'll go down and get ready.

55:39.790 --> 55:41.768
No need to rush.

55:41.792 --> 55:42.792
Okay!

56:36.055 --> 56:37.348
Hi.

56:38.807 --> 56:40.119
Have you been well?

56:40.143 --> 56:41.602
Yeah.

56:43.021 --> 56:44.355
It's you.

56:44.730 --> 56:46.732
Strange meeting you here.

56:47.984 --> 56:50.444
Yeah, really.

56:53.114 --> 56:54.657
I work here.

56:56.075 --> 56:57.785
You came for a movie?

56:59.245 --> 57:01.455
Yes, I came to see a movie.

57:02.081 --> 57:04.184
- You work here?
- Yes.

57:04.208 --> 57:06.520
I didn't know.

57:06.544 --> 57:08.879
I've worked here two years.

57:10.298 --> 57:12.925
I didn't know you were here.

57:23.561 --> 57:25.938
You look the same, still skinny.

57:27.898 --> 57:29.233
Yeah?

57:31.110 --> 57:34.089
I have something
to say to you, okay?

57:34.113 --> 57:35.323
Sure.

57:37.158 --> 57:38.534
You came alone?

57:38.909 --> 57:39.952
Yes.

57:42.413 --> 57:43.789
Are you married?

57:44.457 --> 57:46.667
Yes. And you?

57:46.959 --> 57:48.419
Of course.

57:49.128 --> 57:51.380
Oh, right.

57:53.007 --> 57:55.759
I knew that.
I heard it before.

58:00.389 --> 58:02.516
Who did you marry?

58:04.977 --> 58:07.063
You're curious?

58:08.897 --> 58:13.444
A guy, just some guy
you don't know.

58:14.278 --> 58:15.529
I see.

58:18.574 --> 58:21.827
I thought of you sometimes.

58:22.203 --> 58:23.537
Really?

58:43.224 --> 58:46.018
I never run into you.

58:46.602 --> 58:49.772
Other people I run into
every so often.

58:50.481 --> 58:52.691
But not you.

58:55.778 --> 58:57.821
Seoul is so big.

58:58.406 --> 59:00.074
Right.

59:00.824 --> 59:05.954
If you stay in your own area,
you never see people.

59:06.455 --> 59:07.581
Right.

59:08.999 --> 59:10.918
It's been so long.

59:13.796 --> 59:16.340
- Here's your coffee.
- Thanks.

59:19.718 --> 59:23.889
It's good to
talk to you like this.

59:24.307 --> 59:25.825
How are you doing?

59:25.849 --> 59:32.064
Me? I'm fine.
What about you?

59:32.981 --> 59:37.195
Not bad.
Life's a bit boring.

59:37.861 --> 59:40.323
You wanted to say
something to me?

59:42.408 --> 59:43.409
Yes.

59:46.036 --> 59:52.126
There is.
How should I say it?

59:54.837 --> 59:56.755
I'm sorry.

1:00:00.676 --> 1:00:02.803
I'm really sorry.

1:00:06.182 --> 1:00:11.145
Don't say sorry.
It's nothing.

1:00:12.896 --> 1:00:17.818
There's no need for that.
Don't think about it.

1:00:18.736 --> 1:00:20.488
Really?

1:00:21.947 --> 1:00:23.532
Thank you.

1:00:27.203 --> 1:00:34.460
It's in the past,
but I really wanted to say sorry.

1:00:37.713 --> 1:00:43.719
No, I hardly even remember it.

1:00:44.720 --> 1:00:48.224
So don't worry, it's fine.

1:00:48.974 --> 1:00:50.351
Forget it.

1:00:51.018 --> 1:00:54.313
- You really feel that way?
- I really do.

1:00:56.274 --> 1:01:02.446
I never think about
the two of you.

1:01:03.531 --> 1:01:04.531
Okay.

1:01:06.450 --> 1:01:08.160
That's good, then.

1:01:24.092 --> 1:01:25.844
I'm really sorry.

1:01:28.639 --> 1:01:31.309
I felt really bad.

1:01:32.851 --> 1:01:34.603
It's okay.

1:01:36.939 --> 1:01:38.316
Okay.

1:01:39.983 --> 1:01:41.735
All right, then.

1:01:43.571 --> 1:01:45.030
Oh my.

1:01:46.740 --> 1:01:49.243
It's so nice here.

1:01:50.035 --> 1:01:51.662
It is.

1:03:45.776 --> 1:03:46.920
Woojin.

1:03:46.944 --> 1:03:49.154
- Is the movie over?
- Yeah.

1:03:49.613 --> 1:03:51.699
- Can I come in?
- Sure.

1:04:00.874 --> 1:04:05.522
I'm no good at this.

1:04:05.546 --> 1:04:06.839
It's okay.

1:04:12.470 --> 1:04:13.721
Have some.

1:04:13.971 --> 1:04:17.576
Thanks, but I ate a lot already.

1:04:17.600 --> 1:04:18.369
Really?

1:04:18.393 --> 1:04:20.579
I ate bread in the theater.

1:04:20.603 --> 1:04:21.604
Really?

1:04:22.980 --> 1:04:25.273
You're not supposed
to eat in the theater.

1:04:27.234 --> 1:04:28.234
Sorry.

1:04:29.236 --> 1:04:33.949
- Did you like the film?
- Yes, it was peaceful.

1:04:34.492 --> 1:04:37.411
It was nice, thanks.

1:04:37.995 --> 1:04:39.514
Why thank me?

1:04:39.538 --> 1:04:41.457
For showing a good movie.

1:04:42.458 --> 1:04:45.520
I thought you came
to see Seonggu.

1:04:45.544 --> 1:04:49.339
- Really? I didn't.
- I know.

1:04:50.173 --> 1:04:52.276
Is he doing something here?

1:04:52.300 --> 1:04:56.221
A book concert.
In the basement theater.

1:04:56.388 --> 1:04:57.973
He does those?

1:04:58.140 --> 1:05:00.934
It got scheduled here.
It's annoying.

1:05:01.435 --> 1:05:06.273
I don't know book concerts,
never been to one.

1:05:06.482 --> 1:05:08.025
What is it?

1:05:08.150 --> 1:05:11.111
Just a meeting with an author.

1:05:12.530 --> 1:05:15.925
Then they add things
in the middle.

1:05:15.949 --> 1:05:20.203
Show videos, invite a singer...

1:05:21.121 --> 1:05:25.333
- You prepare all that?
- No, the staff here does it.

1:05:25.584 --> 1:05:27.294
I don't even go down.

1:05:27.545 --> 1:05:28.629
Why not?

1:05:30.213 --> 1:05:36.637
Honestly, I don't like
that he's so popular.

1:05:37.220 --> 1:05:38.907
It's not good.

1:05:38.931 --> 1:05:40.575
- Really?
- Yeah.

1:05:40.599 --> 1:05:42.560
For him, either.

1:05:46.313 --> 1:05:49.483
Are you two doing well?

1:05:50.108 --> 1:05:51.569
Not bad.

1:05:51.944 --> 1:05:57.908
We each have our own work,
so we keep busy.

1:05:58.784 --> 1:06:01.954
It's fine, we've been
together a long time.

1:06:02.705 --> 1:06:05.224
Do you talk a lot?

1:06:05.248 --> 1:06:06.249
Well...

1:06:07.543 --> 1:06:12.297
Sometimes when we drink at home.

1:06:12.798 --> 1:06:16.635
But after so long,
we don't talk much.

1:06:17.928 --> 1:06:21.056
I saw him on TV.

1:06:21.473 --> 1:06:22.516
Did you?

1:06:24.434 --> 1:06:26.729
How did you feel?

1:06:27.896 --> 1:06:29.857
He talks so much.

1:06:30.232 --> 1:06:33.902
Made me wonder
if I ever really knew him.

1:06:34.361 --> 1:06:37.823
He's changed, it seems to me.

1:06:38.240 --> 1:06:40.450
He loves to talk.

1:06:41.118 --> 1:06:46.289
Whatever the subject,
he blurts out everything he knows.

1:06:46.790 --> 1:06:48.208
I'm sick of it!

1:06:48.584 --> 1:06:50.562
Really?

1:06:50.586 --> 1:06:53.631
You didn't date him very long.

1:06:54.923 --> 1:06:58.969
And back then,
he wasn't so talkative.

1:06:59.427 --> 1:07:02.574
He was more serious.
Sharper.

1:07:02.598 --> 1:07:03.974
Right.

1:07:04.266 --> 1:07:07.645
But now he's styled
himself as an orator.

1:07:08.061 --> 1:07:09.354
Yeah.

1:07:11.273 --> 1:07:16.945
What I hate about the TV is,
he keeps saying the same thing.

1:07:17.112 --> 1:07:20.240
It's absurd
how he repeats himself.

1:07:22.367 --> 1:07:24.929
My own husband,

1:07:24.953 --> 1:07:30.668
rattling off the same comments
over and over in front of people...

1:07:32.377 --> 1:07:35.130
- It's hard to take.
- Sure.

1:07:36.048 --> 1:07:38.151
He says the same thing?

1:07:38.175 --> 1:07:43.281
If he just repeats himself,
how can that be sincere?

1:07:43.305 --> 1:07:44.365
Right.

1:07:44.389 --> 1:07:47.661
That means it's all from memory,

1:07:47.685 --> 1:07:51.455
but how can that be sincere?

1:07:51.479 --> 1:07:54.458
And with that serious face.

1:07:54.482 --> 1:07:55.377
Right.

1:07:55.401 --> 1:08:01.073
It seems ridiculous.
What is that? It's stupid.

1:08:02.032 --> 1:08:03.992
Why does he do it?

1:08:04.910 --> 1:08:06.912
Why does he?

1:08:07.746 --> 1:08:10.666
He'll regret it later.

1:08:11.709 --> 1:08:15.963
Or he might go around
boasting of it.

1:08:17.005 --> 1:08:18.256
Will he?

1:08:25.180 --> 1:08:26.264
Have an apple.

1:08:26.473 --> 1:08:28.058
Looks good.

1:08:28.809 --> 1:08:31.019
What does your husband do?

1:08:31.144 --> 1:08:35.190
Translating, from English.
He teaches, too.

1:08:36.692 --> 1:08:39.027
Wow, what does he translate?

1:08:39.653 --> 1:08:43.991
Mostly he does history books,

1:08:44.491 --> 1:08:46.660
or sometimes novels.

1:08:47.535 --> 1:08:50.455
That sounds fun, translating.

1:08:51.373 --> 1:08:53.125
He's home every day.

1:08:53.333 --> 1:08:59.816
He wakes up at dawn and
translates until noon,

1:08:59.840 --> 1:09:03.385
then he teaches
2-3 days per week.

1:09:04.594 --> 1:09:07.347
- That's how we live.
- Really?

1:09:08.348 --> 1:09:10.517
Why come alone today?

1:09:10.934 --> 1:09:12.310
He's on a business trip.

1:09:13.520 --> 1:09:16.398
It's our first time apart
in ages.

1:09:16.564 --> 1:09:17.564
Really?

1:09:17.733 --> 1:09:20.819
We're hardly ever apart.

1:09:21.569 --> 1:09:27.284
In the 5 years since we married,
we haven't spent a day apart.

1:09:27.701 --> 1:09:32.015
Really?
How is that possible?

1:09:32.039 --> 1:09:33.832
He says,

1:09:34.207 --> 1:09:38.146
people in love
should always stick together.

1:09:38.170 --> 1:09:40.338
That it's natural.

1:09:40.798 --> 1:09:45.427
Wow, Seonggu is
the total opposite.

1:09:46.428 --> 1:09:49.097
But I think it's good.

1:09:49.890 --> 1:09:51.767
You think so?

1:09:52.309 --> 1:09:55.729
Yeah, I'm envious.

1:09:58.190 --> 1:10:00.943
I think people are
more envious of you.

1:10:03.946 --> 1:10:08.033
Tell them not to be.
What do they know?

1:10:08.658 --> 1:10:10.994
You're right.

1:10:16.458 --> 1:10:17.334
It's tasty.

1:10:17.459 --> 1:10:20.337
- Tasty?
- Yeah, it's good.

1:10:22.840 --> 1:10:24.818
Wow, tasty!

1:10:24.842 --> 1:10:26.176
Good, right?

1:10:28.511 --> 1:10:30.597
- It's sweet.
- It's tasty.

1:10:35.602 --> 1:10:36.746
You can smoke here.

1:10:36.770 --> 1:10:37.747
Thank you.

1:10:37.771 --> 1:10:41.625
- Do you need anything else?
- No.

1:10:41.649 --> 1:10:43.002
Then I'll wait inside.

1:10:43.026 --> 1:10:45.028
- I'll be right down.
- Okay.

1:11:05.215 --> 1:11:06.466
I heard you came.

1:11:07.509 --> 1:11:08.403
You've been well?

1:11:08.427 --> 1:11:12.222
You were here?
Hello.

1:11:14.307 --> 1:11:16.768
I've got a thing downstairs.

1:11:17.602 --> 1:11:18.686
How've you been?

1:11:19.229 --> 1:11:21.899
I was talking with
Woojin upstairs.

1:11:22.399 --> 1:11:23.608
I see.

1:11:24.484 --> 1:11:26.361
You met her again upstairs?

1:11:26.904 --> 1:11:28.947
I heard many people came.

1:11:29.948 --> 1:11:31.909
I guess so.
I don't know.

1:11:37.122 --> 1:11:42.502
Now that I'm older,
seeing you is awkward.

1:11:44.046 --> 1:11:45.380
Really?

1:11:46.298 --> 1:11:50.177
I feel comfortable.
You're uncomfortable?

1:11:50.802 --> 1:11:52.804
It's just awkward.

1:11:53.388 --> 1:11:55.348
You still smoke.

1:11:56.599 --> 1:12:00.103
They say you have to die
to quit smoking.

1:12:00.687 --> 1:12:03.773
The stress from quitting
is worse than the cigarettes.

1:12:04.024 --> 1:12:06.068
That's what a doctor said.

1:12:10.447 --> 1:12:15.535
How could you come here?

1:12:17.454 --> 1:12:19.247
Don't smoke too much.

1:12:19.915 --> 1:12:22.334
Did you call me once?

1:12:26.171 --> 1:12:27.297
Yeah.

1:12:28.673 --> 1:12:30.467
It's been a long time.

1:12:34.012 --> 1:12:38.266
You think I came
because of you? I didn't.

1:12:39.059 --> 1:12:42.187
You didn't?
Never mind, then.

1:12:44.314 --> 1:12:46.900
How have you been?

1:12:47.359 --> 1:12:50.153
Yes, I have a good life.

1:12:51.446 --> 1:12:55.033
Do you?
That's great.

1:12:56.368 --> 1:12:58.954
I saw you on TV.

1:13:01.414 --> 1:13:02.916
You did?

1:13:04.126 --> 1:13:06.503
It's funny, right?

1:13:07.462 --> 1:13:09.214
You talk a lot.

1:13:10.090 --> 1:13:12.092
You talked so much,

1:13:12.884 --> 1:13:17.764
later I doubted if
you were sincere.

1:13:18.473 --> 1:13:23.645
If you keep talking so much,
you'll lose it completely.

1:13:23.937 --> 1:13:26.856
You really should
just stop talking.

1:13:29.609 --> 1:13:31.653
That's what you felt?

1:13:33.613 --> 1:13:35.657
Not that it concerns me.

1:13:39.661 --> 1:13:41.913
Then why'd you come?

1:13:42.664 --> 1:13:43.665
What?

1:13:49.421 --> 1:13:53.216
I'd better go this way.
Goodbye.

1:13:53.341 --> 1:13:54.592
Oh, okay.

1:13:54.801 --> 1:13:56.136
See you!
