Tommy, can you believe your mom
is 39 years old today?

01:07.525 --> 01:09.903
I know. I don't look a day over 17.

01:12.864 --> 01:14.866
Don't give me that look,
just go with it.

01:19.204 --> 01:20.705
Oh, I told you all to ignore my--

01:20.789 --> 01:21.998

Out.

01:31.966 --> 01:34.385
I thought we agreed
to no party this year.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.346
Well, you agreed. Not us.

01:38.014 --> 01:40.016
What? You nodded when I said it.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.227
I have a medical condition.

01:43.394 --> 01:44.771
Nodding neck syndrome.

01:46.689 --> 01:49.025
Look, we found your secret dream board

01:49.109 --> 01:51.694
of things you wanna do
before you turn 40.

01:51.778 --> 01:54.447
Hey, that was hidden under my bed.

01:56.407 --> 01:57.700
If you wanted to keep it a secret,

01:57.784 --> 01:59.869
you shouldn't have said
where it was in your diary.

02:02.163 --> 02:03.373
You read my diary?

02:03.456 --> 02:04.707
It helps me sleep.

02:07.293 --> 02:10.088
So, these are your dreams.

02:10.672 --> 02:11.673
Skydiving.

02:11.756 --> 02:12.674
Oh, please.

02:13.424 --> 02:14.884
I'm gonna do it!

02:15.426 --> 02:17.345
As soon as I get over
my fear of heights.

02:18.513 --> 02:19.556
And planes.

02:20.515 --> 02:22.058
And a man attached to my back.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.353
Coffee with Ryan Gosling.

02:25.436 --> 02:26.855
It could happen.

02:26.938 --> 02:29.482
I wouldn't mind Ryan Gosling
attached to my back.

But number one
on the DJ Tanner dream board:

02:34.112 --> 02:36.489
front row seats
to New Kids on the Block.

Well of course.
I mean, I'm their biggest Blockhead.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.039

I haven't heard one of those
since your wedding night.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.352
How did you get these?

03:06.436 --> 03:08.938
Now, I don't want you to think
about how much they cost.

is no longer my own.

my best friend since I was five.

Yeah, and you've been
my best friend since I was born.

03:21.868 --> 03:25.705
Aww, it's hugging time!

Let me see.

03:44.515 --> 03:46.643
Uh... Kimmy?

03:46.726 --> 03:48.228
These tickets look funny.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.480
And why do they say
"New Kids on the Clock"?

03:52.649 --> 03:54.317
I'm sure that's just a misprint.

03:55.026 --> 03:56.569
Where did you get these?

03:56.653 --> 03:58.154
I found a guy online.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.031
These tickets are counterfeit.

Man, what are we gonna do?

04:11.668 --> 04:13.461
I guess we have to tell DJ the truth.

I love you guys so much.
Best birthday ever!

04:22.262 --> 04:23.346

-But that's how old she is.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.094
I got us a meeting
with New Kids on the Block.

Are you sure you don't just mean
New Kids on the Clock?

05:07.181 --> 05:09.267
Anyway, I'm gonna ask them
for front row tickets.

05:09.350 --> 05:12.562
Because I'm president of the Blockheads
For New Kids Fan Club International.

05:14.647 --> 05:17.317
-You just made that up.
-They don't know that. Shh.

05:28.119 --> 05:29.078

05:29.162 --> 05:31.205
Yes, we have a meeting with the band.

05:31.289 --> 05:34.584
What kind of meeting starts
at a red light in the middle of traffic?

05:36.294 --> 05:37.837

Well... thank you.

12:55.691 --> 12:57.318
But... why?

12:58.736 --> 13:03.491
Because I won't be living here forever,
and now, in a way, I will be.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.620
You should hang it over the fireplace.

on the Block doing in my house?

we bought were counterfeit.

and sent me to get the tickets.

if it was gonna work out

-and didn't wanna get your hopes up.
-Aww, is that true?

a patient of mine

22:26.595 --> 22:27.846

22:27.929 --> 22:30.265
I cleared up a wicked case of toe fungus.

22:33.018 --> 22:33.852
But why?

22:33.935 --> 22:36.730
Well, because if left untreated
you could lose the nail.

22:39.941 --> 22:41.359
Why did you give me credit?

22:41.443 --> 22:43.653
