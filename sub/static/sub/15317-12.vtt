No... crap.

What is it?

02:07.435 --> 02:08.435
It's not in him anymore, is it?

02:08.436 --> 02:09.502
Look at him.

for a long, long time.

02:37.777 --> 02:39.443

02:39.444 --> 02:41.844
Okay, people, moving on.

02:41.845 --> 02:43.078
Spread out.

02:43.079 --> 02:45.913

our spin is holding up.

What is causing this?

06:21.068 --> 06:22.702
No idea,

06:22.703 --> 06:23.968

Maybe, but this is

06:37.083 --> 06:38.482

06:38.483 --> 06:39.783

06:45.490 --> 06:46.723
A change in atmosphere?

06:46.724 --> 06:48.157
No way. Our satellite feeds

06:48.158 --> 06:49.425

arguing over the cause

07:06.443 --> 07:08.411

07:36.606 --> 07:39.207
There has to be a reason
that this is happening.

07:39.208 --> 07:40.508
We just have to remain vigilant

07:40.509 --> 07:41.910
until we can figure out what it is.

07:41.911 --> 07:45.680
In the meantime, survey
your sentient abnormals,

07:45.681 --> 07:46.781

I'm not sure if this falls

08:01.264 --> 08:02.531
under our purview,

08:02.532 --> 08:04.733
but I thought it was worth mentioning.

08:04.734 --> 08:07.570
A man was found shot dead in Dharavi.

He had the mark of Kali on his left leg.

08:09.573 --> 08:11.206

Yeah, it's an ancient cult

Its followers were rumored to
be able to foretell disaster.

08:17.614 --> 08:18.714

08:32.496 --> 08:33.996
anything, no matter how insignificant,

08:33.998 --> 08:34.998
could be a factor.

Damn, there aren't
that many of these left.

10:15.893 --> 10:17.360
I've arranged for a helicopter transport

10:17.361 --> 10:18.728
to Cairo.

10:18.729 --> 10:21.364
We should do a biopsy
on the wings, tail,

10:21.365 --> 10:22.732
and cephalic lobe,

10:22.733 --> 10:24.167
send them to London.

10:24.168 --> 10:25.769
Declan can do a full work-up,

10:25.770 --> 10:27.939
see if there's any link
to the other abnormals.

10:39.387 --> 10:41.655
Any chance we can get
access to the victim?

10:41.656 --> 10:43.390
We're in good with
the local authorities.

10:43.391 --> 10:44.825
They've given us the crime scene,

10:44.826 --> 10:46.159
and I've arranged with the coroner

10:46.160 --> 10:47.294
to "borrow" the body
for a window of time.

10:47.295 --> 10:48.262

10:52.300 --> 10:54.034
Still haven't ID'd the body.

10:54.035 --> 10:55.301
They think this was just

10:55.302 --> 10:56.736
another drug deal gone bad.

10:56.737 --> 10:57.971
I dot think so.

10:57.972 --> 10:59.305
Talk to me, William.

10:59.306 --> 11:01.340
Well, the spatter angle seems very long.

11:01.341 --> 11:02.642
I mean, do you think slum gangbangers

11:02.643 --> 11:03.710
carry that heavy a caliber?

11:03.711 --> 11:05.379
Doubtful.

11:05.380 --> 11:06.814
Cheaper the gun, smaller the bullet.

11:06.815 --> 11:09.050
I'm thinking...

11:09.051 --> 11:10.317
Military issue.

11:11.686 --> 11:12.653
These are new treads.

11:12.654 --> 11:13.754
It's a recent acquisition.

11:13.755 --> 11:14.989
Yeah, those kicks st.

11:14.990 --> 11:17.122
Okay, so...

11:17.123 --> 11:18.921
Some dudes with expensive boots

11:18.922 --> 11:21.724
and even more expensive guns were here.

11:21.725 --> 11:23.726
So not a local job, then.

11:23.727 --> 11:25.328
Well...

11:25.329 --> 11:27.063
I'm saying no.

11:29.466 --> 11:31.800
[Chuckles]

11:31.801 --> 11:33.802
Not unless the locals buy their guns

11:33.803 --> 11:37.071
direct from the manufacturer.

11:37.072 --> 11:39.806
Armor-piercing 9 mil.

11:39.807 --> 11:41.207
Still jagged.

11:41.208 --> 11:42.909
Russian.

11:42.910 --> 11:44.777
Pricey.

11:44.778 --> 11:45.978
You thought I was just a token Indian,

11:45.979 --> 11:47.413
didn't you?

11:47.414 --> 11:49.781
Okay, so, all of this points

11:49.782 --> 11:52.751
to a professional, if
not military-style hit.

11:52.752 --> 11:53.919
Why?

11:53.920 --> 11:55.854
I mean, who is this guy?

11:55.855 --> 11:56.955
What did they want from him?

11:56.956 --> 11:59.758
Or this cult he belonged to?

12:01.160 --> 12:02.994
Hey, Ravi, what's this?

12:02.995 --> 12:04.896
Ah, a shrine to the goddess Durga.

12:04.897 --> 12:07.031
They're fairly common.

12:11.069 --> 12:12.302
Okay.

12:12.303 --> 12:13.903
So the witnesses say

12:13.904 --> 12:15.338
that the victim was being chased,

12:15.339 --> 12:16.940
but he had a good head start.

12:16.941 --> 12:18.207
There's lots of ways out of this alley.

12:18.208 --> 12:19.442
Why did he stop here?

12:19.443 --> 12:21.277
'Cause he was headed this way?

12:21.278 --> 12:23.012
Yeah.

12:23.013 --> 12:27.015
Hey, what do you make of this?

12:29.118 --> 12:30.318
Nice call.

12:45.166 --> 12:46.166
Uh, Dr. Zimmerman...

12:46.167 --> 12:47.367
[Stone grinding heavily]

12:52.939 --> 12:55.774
Will Z. with the score.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.075
You guys are good.

12:58.444 --> 12:59.477
Is that supposed to be there?

12:59.478 --> 13:01.312
No.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.091
Huh...

13:13.092 --> 13:16.294
Let's get this back to the Sanctuary.

13:26.408 --> 13:28.845
Helicopter's a half an hour out.

13:28.846 --> 13:30.280
Apparently, they had some problems

13:30.281 --> 13:31.415
with navigations.

13:31.416 --> 13:32.650
That's all right.

13:32.651 --> 13:34.319
It's giving me a chance
to study these samples.

13:34.320 --> 13:36.989
What do you make of this?

13:41.495 --> 13:42.895
Evidence of nociception.

13:42.896 --> 13:43.996
Exactly.

13:43.997 --> 13:45.430
This creature was in pain.

13:45.431 --> 13:46.896
Which explains the fear reaction,

13:46.897 --> 13:47.996
but what caused it?

13:47.997 --> 13:49.896
I still don't know.

13:49.897 --> 13:51.197
I have to compare results with Declan

13:51.198 --> 13:52.331
when I get back to London.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.100
Pili?

13:55.101 --> 13:58.536
You worked with Terrance
Wexford in Berlin, right?

14:00.072 --> 14:01.539
Yes.

14:01.540 --> 14:04.274
How do you think he's
enjoying his new post?

14:06.044 --> 14:10.513
I think he's enjoying the
authority of it immensely.

14:10.514 --> 14:12.514
I see.

14:12.515 --> 14:13.815
Thank you, Pili.

14:24.091 --> 14:26.359
You think this was
hidden by the dead guy?

14:26.360 --> 14:28.094
Or someone else.

14:28.095 --> 14:29.528
Or it means nothing.

14:29.529 --> 14:33.366
We'll run some scans, see what turns up.

14:33.367 --> 14:35.301
Indian military has no
record of any personnel

14:35.302 --> 14:37.303
operating in Dharavi during
the time of the murder.

14:37.304 --> 14:40.372
Okay, so we're looking
for career mercenaries,

14:40.373 --> 14:42.141
ex-military.

14:42.142 --> 14:44.109
I'll send out a few emails,

14:44.110 --> 14:46.612
see if any k&r or
Blackwater guys were in town.

14:48.848 --> 14:50.515
[Will]: No trace on the casing we found?

14:50.516 --> 14:53.552
[Ravi]: None, but we do
have an ID on the victim,

14:53.553 --> 14:55.087
one Ajay Paveljit.

14:55.088 --> 14:56.155
No immediate family. No fixed address.

14:56.156 --> 14:57.856
Huh.

14:57.857 --> 14:59.058
The body's downstairs.

14:59.059 --> 15:00.593
We're ready to start the autopsy.

15:03.496 --> 15:05.963
Wow, I am, uh, jetlagged.

15:05.964 --> 15:07.398
I think I better turn in,

15:07.399 --> 15:09.199
but why don't you do the autopsy,

15:09.200 --> 15:11.435
and we'll just go over
the results tomorrow?

15:17.411 --> 15:18.779
Thought he was a doctor.

15:18.780 --> 15:23.249
He is, just not the kind
that likes autopsies.

16:14.585 --> 16:15.718
Hey, wake up!

16:17.688 --> 16:18.855
[Knocking]

16:18.856 --> 16:21.724
Don't make me come in there.

16:21.725 --> 16:24.494
No, seriously, don't
make me come in there.

16:24.495 --> 16:27.330
[Knocking]

16:27.331 --> 16:28.565
Hey!

16:28.566 --> 16:30.533
Wow.

16:30.534 --> 16:32.335
Next time you should
actually try sleeping.

16:32.336 --> 16:36.870
Oh, I don't know...

16:36.871 --> 16:39.604
I guess it's the 22
time zones in two days.

16:39.605 --> 16:41.572
Well, snap out it.

16:41.573 --> 16:43.641
Ravi's downstairs. He
says he's got something.

16:44.911 --> 16:47.546
All right, I'll be down in a minute.

16:53.954 --> 16:55.621
Tests on the statue came back clean.

16:55.622 --> 16:58.057
There's nothing unusual about it,

16:58.058 --> 17:00.659
however...

17:00.660 --> 17:03.829
I completed the autopsy on Mr. Paveljit.

17:03.830 --> 17:04.929
According to his DNA scan,

17:04.930 --> 17:06.830
he's human,

17:06.832 --> 17:07.865
so imagine my surprise

17:07.866 --> 17:09.366
when I examined his internal organs

17:09.367 --> 17:10.733
and found evidence

17:10.734 --> 17:12.801
that he was over 200 years old.

17:12.803 --> 17:14.203
What?

17:14.204 --> 17:16.238
But his DNA is normalI

17:16.239 --> 17:17.071
You're sure?

17:17.073 --> 17:17.906
Absolutely.

17:17.906 --> 17:19.708
He's 100% human.

17:19.709 --> 17:21.643
I ran the test three times to be sure.

17:27.214 --> 17:31.254
Crafty son of a bitch.

17:31.255 --> 17:33.689
Stares down the barrel of a gun

17:33.690 --> 17:37.359
not 20 feet away from where
he hid the bloody thing.

17:37.360 --> 17:39.827
That's devotion.

17:39.828 --> 17:42.196
So where is it now?

17:42.197 --> 17:43.997
Well, often, that's a good question.

17:43.998 --> 17:46.199
Any sign of the old
woman, or the statue? No?

17:46.200 --> 17:48.068
This one said he saw
someone take the statue,

17:48.069 --> 17:49.202
a man.

17:49.203 --> 17:52.204
Was he a white man like me?

17:52.205 --> 17:53.272
Yeah.

17:53.273 --> 17:54.640
Yeah?

17:57.977 --> 18:00.177
Competition.

18:00.178 --> 18:01.211
Hmm.

18:01.212 --> 18:03.981
Magnus's people.

18:03.982 --> 18:05.849
It would be so crappy

18:05.850 --> 18:08.818
if they got to the bug before us.

18:08.819 --> 18:10.620
[Sighs]

18:10.621 --> 18:12.855
Lads, this just got more difficult.

18:15.692 --> 18:16.860
[Declan]: How was Egypt?

18:16.861 --> 18:18.030
[Magnus]: [Sighs] Tiring,

18:18.031 --> 18:19.332
and what's the other
word I'm looking for?

18:19.333 --> 18:20.800
Ah, yes, Sandy.

18:20.801 --> 18:22.001
What's been happening here?

18:22.002 --> 18:23.069
Well, you'll be pleased to hear

18:23.070 --> 18:24.371
at most of the affected abnormals

18:24.372 --> 18:25.974
have calmed down substantially.

18:25.975 --> 18:27.309
Whatever wascausing the flare-up

18:27.310 --> 18:28.677
seems to have dissipated somewhat.

18:28.678 --> 18:29.844
Well, that's a relief.

18:34.150 --> 18:35.450
These are the locations

18:35.451 --> 18:37.752
where the events took place.

18:37.753 --> 18:41.121
London, Tokyo, Sydney,
Rio, Lagos, Cairo.

18:41.122 --> 18:43.090
There doesn't appear to be
a common link between them.

18:43.091 --> 18:44.825
No pattern that I can discern.

18:44.826 --> 18:46.160
You're saying all these places

18:46.161 --> 18:47.794
were affected at the same time?

18:47.795 --> 18:49.296
Yeah, roughly, why?

18:49.297 --> 18:50.764
Well, if it was some kind of trigger,

18:50.765 --> 18:52.865
it would have to be very
strong and moving very quickly.

18:52.866 --> 18:54.334
An EM pulse of some kind.

18:54.335 --> 18:55.902
Maybe.

18:55.903 --> 18:57.437
But that doesn't align with
the symptoms we're seeing.

18:57.438 --> 18:58.872
Exactly.

18:58.873 --> 18:59.907
Mean, none of the
abnormals we're dealing with

18:59.908 --> 19:01.141
are usually affected by Em spikes.

19:01.142 --> 19:02.443
Not to mention,

19:02.444 --> 19:03.844
I don't know anything powerful enough

19:03.845 --> 19:06.481
to send a pulse worldwide like that.

19:06.482 --> 19:09.283
Still, I'll have Henry go
over the satellite data.

19:09.284 --> 19:10.851
There must be something we're missing.

19:12.953 --> 19:15.055
You were right about the pulse.

19:15.056 --> 19:16.256
Chinese weather satellite

19:16.257 --> 19:18.391
caught a trace of a
unique energy signature

19:18.392 --> 19:20.026
right around the time
the incidents began,

19:20.027 --> 19:21.960
but I followed it to this.

19:22.962 --> 19:25.096
It's an em pulse originating in Mumbai,

19:25.097 --> 19:26.365
right in the heart of Dharavi.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.034
Dear God.

19:28.035 --> 19:29.236
Yeah, that's pretty much what I said.

19:29.237 --> 19:31.004
So, what do you think it means?

19:31.005 --> 19:35.441
That this is somehow
connected to the cult of Kali.

19:38.078 --> 19:39.480
And voila.

19:39.481 --> 19:40.848
Drink this.

19:40.849 --> 19:42.283
Thanks.

19:42.284 --> 19:43.751
[Sighs in frustration]

19:43.752 --> 19:45.853
I don't know what's wrong with me.

19:45.854 --> 19:47.321
I feel like I'm dying or something.

19:47.322 --> 19:49.290
Maybe it's something you ate.

19:49.291 --> 19:50.858
You know, the first time I was here,

19:50.859 --> 19:52.393
I had a samosa off the street cart.

19:52.394 --> 19:53.928
I barfed for, like, two days straight...

19:53.929 --> 19:55.963
Okay, thank you.

19:55.964 --> 19:57.264
That's great.

19:57.265 --> 19:58.866
Wow.

19:58.867 --> 20:02.469
Maybe you should go back and lie down.

20:02.470 --> 20:05.204
Yeah, maybe that's a good idea.

20:05.205 --> 20:06.405
Do you want me to come with you?

20:07.507 --> 20:09.142
No, thanks, I'm fine.

20:09.143 --> 20:13.414
Why don't you just keep
asking about the cult?

20:13.415 --> 20:14.348
Oh...

20:14.349 --> 20:15.783
You sure you're okay?

20:15.784 --> 20:17.218
Yeah...

20:17.219 --> 20:20.988
Yeah, I think I just need to sleep.

21:10.475 --> 21:12.376
Quickly! They're coming!

21:16.181 --> 21:20.985
They must not find him.

21:36.053 --> 21:37.020
You lost him?

21:37.021 --> 21:39.256
No, he wasn't feeling well,

21:39.257 --> 21:40.259
so he headed back to
the Sanctuary early.

21:40.410 --> 21:41.711
Did you check the hospitals?

21:41.712 --> 21:42.612
Nobody fits his description.

21:42.613 --> 21:43.880
What about his cell phone?

21:43.881 --> 21:45.882
We tracked it using the GPS.

21:45.883 --> 21:47.617
Found it in a ditch.

21:47.618 --> 21:48.718
I've organized a search.

21:48.719 --> 21:50.452
We have people
going door-to-door.

21:50.453 --> 21:51.553
Don't worry, we'll find him.

21:53.189 --> 21:55.357
Show me this statue you found.

21:57.793 --> 21:59.561
Kate?

21:59.562 --> 22:00.829
[Cocks gun]

22:00.830 --> 22:03.264
He's out there, which means I am too.

22:06.368 --> 22:08.169
We just found out, sir.

22:08.170 --> 22:09.837
She only landed here 90 minutes ago.

22:09.838 --> 22:11.405
Bribe an official.

22:11.406 --> 22:12.539
Get a passenger manifest.

22:12.540 --> 22:13.640
You can't just come to me

22:13.641 --> 22:14.674
and say, "guess what, boss,

22:14.675 --> 22:15.675
she's suddenly in town."

22:15.676 --> 22:16.776
Sir, she flies a private charter

22:16.777 --> 22:17.876
with a bogus flight plan.

22:17.877 --> 22:19.144
There's no way we could have known...

22:19.145 --> 22:22.213
enough, enough.

22:22.214 --> 22:24.315
I mean, this... this isn't a game.

22:24.316 --> 22:25.949
It's a one-shot,

22:25.950 --> 22:27.617
once-in-a-lifetime
thing.

22:27.618 --> 22:29.352
Some mooks from the local Sanctuary,

22:29.353 --> 22:30.420
one thing.

22:30.421 --> 22:32.656
Helen Magnus?

22:32.657 --> 22:36.228
Whoa, she's another,

22:36.229 --> 22:37.262
and it means if we screw up,

22:37.263 --> 22:38.797
even marginally,

22:38.798 --> 22:41.299
we're going to get pinched,

22:41.300 --> 22:43.435
or die,

22:43.436 --> 22:45.505
or worse.

22:48.944 --> 22:51.312
No more surprises.

22:55.451 --> 22:58.185
It commemorates the
ceremony of acceptance.

22:58.186 --> 22:59.453
You recognize it?

22:59.454 --> 23:01.255
From a conference in
Brazil about 40 years ago.

23:01.256 --> 23:03.357
Markings are similar,

23:03.358 --> 23:05.225
signifying a cult member's
initiation as a doot.

23:05.226 --> 23:07.360
"Doot?" I don't know that word.

23:07.361 --> 23:09.796
Ancient Urdu dialect meaning "herald"

23:09.797 --> 23:10.797
or "guardian,"

23:10.798 --> 23:12.733
or in some translations, "prophet".

23:12.734 --> 23:15.903
It was believed that the doots
could foretell disaster...

23:15.904 --> 23:17.404
earthquakes, tsunamis, and the like...

23:17.405 --> 23:18.839
and that the advance warning

23:18.840 --> 23:20.107
gave the other cult
members a chance to escape.

23:20.108 --> 23:21.542
Seems like someone with that ability

23:21.543 --> 23:22.943
would be worth more alive than dead.

23:22.944 --> 23:24.745
Definitely.

23:24.746 --> 23:26.947
You're sure there was
nothing inside these?

23:26.948 --> 23:28.349
They're completely solid.

23:28.350 --> 23:29.516
Scans for surface residue

23:29.517 --> 23:30.984
are still pending.

23:30.985 --> 23:33.586
Huh...

23:33.587 --> 23:35.788
The pattern inside here changes.

23:35.789 --> 23:37.357
The design loses symmetry.

23:41.562 --> 23:44.297
Something's missing.

24:53.868 --> 24:58.105
Durga, where have you been?

24:59.608 --> 25:02.110
I've been looking for you.

25:02.111 --> 25:04.713
I tried to call,

25:04.714 --> 25:07.816
but you didn't answer.

25:11.654 --> 25:14.356
What's wrong?

25:14.357 --> 25:15.424
Are you sick?

25:20.529 --> 25:24.499
What's happened to you?

25:24.500 --> 25:28.669
Why won't you answer me?

25:45.618 --> 25:47.619
Will he survive?

25:58.498 --> 25:59.364
I don't believe it.

25:59.365 --> 26:00.465
What?

26:00.466 --> 26:02.134
Tests show surface residue on the statue

26:02.135 --> 26:03.636
came from a makri.

26:03.637 --> 26:05.137
I'm not familiar with that species.

26:05.138 --> 26:06.505
You wouldn't be.

26:06.506 --> 26:08.307
It's an incredibly rare
species of abnormal spider

26:08.308 --> 26:09.408
that requires a
warm-blooded host to survive.

26:09.409 --> 26:11.310
I thought they were extinct.

26:11.311 --> 26:13.642
Something that rare
would be very valuable...

26:13.643 --> 26:15.076
Oh, no.

26:15.077 --> 26:17.345
This isn't about money.

26:18.981 --> 26:22.616
This is about something far worse.

26:22.617 --> 26:26.152
The makri is a subspecies off-shoot

26:26.153 --> 26:27.720
of a marine-dwelling abnormal

26:27.721 --> 26:30.056
known as gephallis bertallosso.

26:30.057 --> 26:31.590
It's a massive arachnid creature

26:31.591 --> 26:33.592
capable of manipulating tectonic plates

26:33.593 --> 26:36.227
via focused magnetic resonance.

26:36.228 --> 26:38.162
You're talking about big Bertha.

26:39.565 --> 26:41.165
The one who makes the earth move.

26:41.166 --> 26:43.000
And the waters rise.

26:43.001 --> 26:45.035
The makri is its tiny genetic cousin.

26:45.036 --> 26:46.536
They may well have a link,

26:46.537 --> 26:48.505
a chemical, or even psychic bond

26:48.506 --> 26:50.206
that allows the host a deeper connection

26:50.207 --> 26:51.274
to big Bertha.

26:51.275 --> 26:53.642
So if anyone finds this makri...

26:53.643 --> 26:56.077
they could potentially use it

26:56.078 --> 26:58.747
to locate the most
powerful abnormal on earth.

26:58.748 --> 27:00.549
Wait, but big Bertha is dead.

27:00.550 --> 27:01.750
You killed her four years ago, yes?

27:01.751 --> 27:04.719
We all know that.

27:04.720 --> 27:07.255
Dr. Magnus?

27:08.624 --> 27:10.224
Not exactly.

27:10.225 --> 27:12.559
Bertha is alive.

27:16.216 --> 27:18.584
You kept her alive and lied about it?

27:18.585 --> 27:20.619
Historically, creatures
as powerful as big Bertha

27:20.620 --> 27:21.954
have a symbiotic relationship

27:21.955 --> 27:23.956
with other life forms this planet.

27:23.957 --> 27:25.757
I felt that euthanizing her

27:25.758 --> 27:27.526
would create far greater problems...

27:27.527 --> 27:28.994
tidal patterns would be altered,

27:28.995 --> 27:30.595
undersea ecological systems

27:30.596 --> 27:31.930
completely destroyed,

27:31.931 --> 27:34.499
massive geological shifts.

27:34.500 --> 27:35.900
The best course of action

27:35.901 --> 27:38.803
was to keep her secure and under watch.

27:38.804 --> 27:40.671
Killing her posed far greater risks

27:40.672 --> 27:41.873
than keeping her alive.

27:41.874 --> 27:44.008
[Sighs heavily]

27:44.009 --> 27:45.276
Where is she?

27:49.748 --> 27:50.848
A specialized containment field

27:50.849 --> 27:52.850
at the bottom of the Indian ocean.

27:52.851 --> 27:54.052
Which you kept hidden from
the entire Sanctuary...

27:54.053 --> 27:55.620
it was necessary!

27:55.621 --> 27:58.156
To keep her and the
rest of the world safe.

28:02.161 --> 28:03.828
It was my prerogative, Ravi.

28:03.829 --> 28:04.896
My choice.

28:07.798 --> 28:10.067
Okay.

28:10.068 --> 28:11.769
Fine.

28:11.770 --> 28:13.270
We need to dispatch ships immediately,

28:13.271 --> 28:15.306
increase security to the entire area...

28:15.307 --> 28:16.875
Of course. I'll get Henry on it.

28:16.876 --> 28:17.976
He'll coordinate,

28:17.977 --> 28:20.077
but we need to find Will.

28:20.078 --> 28:22.846
If the makri behaves the
way I believe it does,

28:22.847 --> 28:25.216
then it could well be a doorway
into finding Bertha's location,

28:25.217 --> 28:26.651
which is no doubt

28:26.652 --> 28:29.620
what the mercenaries were after
when they killed Mr. Paveljit.

28:36.195 --> 28:37.662
[Gasps]

28:46.272 --> 28:48.940
What happened to me?

28:48.941 --> 28:50.975
You went away for a while,

28:50.976 --> 28:52.210
but now you're back.

28:53.579 --> 28:54.779
Why did I get sick?

28:54.780 --> 28:55.847
Because of the makri,

28:55.848 --> 28:59.985
the ancient spider inside you.

28:59.986 --> 29:01.954
The former host, Ajay,

29:01.955 --> 29:03.121
was being chased by bad men.

29:03.122 --> 29:05.724
He hid the makri in the shrine of Durga.

29:05.725 --> 29:07.659
You found it.

29:07.660 --> 29:09.293
You were not supposed to.

29:11.696 --> 29:13.063
But why did it...

29:13.064 --> 29:14.898
the makri needs a host.

29:14.899 --> 29:17.200
When it doesn't have one,

29:17.201 --> 29:20.036
it speaks for all the world to hear.

29:20.037 --> 29:22.972
It chose you...

29:22.973 --> 29:24.974
Which is a great honor.

29:24.975 --> 29:28.111
I should get back to the Sanctuary.

29:28.112 --> 29:30.747
The streets are not safe.

29:30.748 --> 29:31.815
For that matter,

29:31.816 --> 29:34.117
the Sanctuary may not be either.

29:34.118 --> 29:35.819
You must stay hidden

29:35.820 --> 29:38.288
until you get proper training.

29:38.289 --> 29:39.823
Trained?

29:39.824 --> 29:41.758
To become a suitable host.

29:41.759 --> 29:45.130
It is in the blood of my people

29:45.131 --> 29:47.065
to withstand the trials of the makri.

29:47.066 --> 29:50.769
You are strong,

29:50.770 --> 29:52.771
but you are far from being ready.

29:57.309 --> 29:58.976
Helen, news travels fast.

29:58.977 --> 30:00.711
Terrance.

30:00.712 --> 30:02.413
You kept Bertha alive
after all we discussed.

30:02.414 --> 30:03.647
It was necessary.

30:03.648 --> 30:06.718
And I appreciate your opinion,

30:06.719 --> 30:08.186
but things have changed considerably.

30:08.187 --> 30:09.521
Do you have any leads?

30:09.522 --> 30:11.656
At the moment, we're at
a bit of a disadvantage,

30:11.657 --> 30:13.424
but Bertha is secure, I assure you.

30:13.425 --> 30:15.226
And let's hope she stays that way.

30:15.227 --> 30:17.328
You're certain this
makri is linked to her?

30:17.329 --> 30:18.462
We are now.

30:18.463 --> 30:20.197
Let come to Mumbai,

30:20.198 --> 30:21.898
help you analyze
everything you've learned.

30:21.899 --> 30:23.400
You don't need to do that.

30:23.401 --> 30:25.669
Besides, you've got your
hands full in New York.

30:25.670 --> 30:27.304
You have my complete support, Helen,

30:27.305 --> 30:29.707
you always have,

30:29.708 --> 30:32.276
but people are
questioning your judgment.

30:32.277 --> 30:34.712
I can handle it.

30:34.713 --> 30:37.381
I hope so.

30:46.357 --> 30:48.358
What is the makri?

30:48.359 --> 30:53.163
It's what gives you your power.

30:53.164 --> 30:54.832
My power?

30:54.833 --> 30:56.800
To be a doot,

30:56.801 --> 30:58.869
a prophet.

30:58.870 --> 31:00.270
It is through you

31:00.271 --> 31:02.239
that the destroyer of the
world communicates with us.

31:04.108 --> 31:05.175
[Whispers]: Kali...

31:05.176 --> 31:08.044
She is extremely powerful.

31:08.045 --> 31:11.314
Without the makri to
help us speak to her,

31:11.315 --> 31:14.083
we'll be as helpless
as leaves in the wind.

31:14.084 --> 31:17.286
That's the woman of my visions.

31:17.287 --> 31:18.321
That's Kali.

31:20.891 --> 31:22.391
You're seeing her already?

31:22.392 --> 31:27.497
Then your connection
must be very strong.

31:40.377 --> 31:42.345
What are we going to do?

31:42.346 --> 31:43.813
Run and hide.

31:43.814 --> 31:44.981
Go, go, go, go, go.

31:57.062 --> 31:59.163
Check in there.

32:08.775 --> 32:12.277
[Dishes breaking]

32:12.278 --> 32:14.512
We've got search ships
moving into the area now.

32:14.513 --> 32:15.546
We should be at Bertha's coordinates

32:15.547 --> 32:17.147
in six hours or less.

32:17.148 --> 32:18.449
Good.

32:18.450 --> 32:19.650
I want you on a plane
immediately with the weapon.

32:19.651 --> 32:21.319
We'll monitor her sensors from here.

32:21.320 --> 32:23.388
Yeah, about that.

32:23.389 --> 32:28.126
Just so you know, I went
over the sensor logs.

32:28.127 --> 32:31.262
You know how she's supposedly
been asleep this whole time?

32:31.263 --> 32:32.897
Well, guess what happened

32:32.898 --> 32:35.332
at roughly the same time

32:35.333 --> 32:37.434
as the Mumbai EM pulse?

32:37.435 --> 32:39.002
She responded to the call of the makri.

32:39.003 --> 32:40.437
Yeah.

32:40.438 --> 32:42.939
She emitted a magnetic
burst so low in frequency

32:42.940 --> 32:44.274
at the sensors didn't detect it

32:44.275 --> 32:45.542
until I did a full scan,

32:45.543 --> 32:47.043
but it was powerful enough

32:47.044 --> 32:49.312
to briefly alter the
earth's magnetic field.

32:49.313 --> 32:51.881
Magnetic North was shifted

32:51.882 --> 32:54.450
by one hundred thousandth of a degree.

32:54.451 --> 32:55.585
Navigation instruments
all over the world

32:55.586 --> 32:56.585
were affected.

32:56.586 --> 32:59.188
Doc, that is power.

33:01.991 --> 33:03.458
Let's go, come on.

33:03.459 --> 33:05.327
Let's go.

33:05.328 --> 33:06.495
Well, who said

33:06.496 --> 33:09.198
good things don't happen
to good people, huh?

33:10.534 --> 33:11.601
Dr. Will Zimmerman?

33:17.506 --> 33:19.607
And you...

33:19.608 --> 33:21.609
Oh, I've been looking for you for years.

33:25.047 --> 33:26.414
If I'm not mistaken,

33:26.415 --> 33:27.548
you're the last surviving member

33:27.549 --> 33:28.816
of the cult of Kali.

33:28.817 --> 33:30.184
You're too old to withstand it,

33:30.185 --> 33:32.386
so the spider's got to be in him.

33:32.387 --> 33:34.221
Please, you must not do this.

33:34.222 --> 33:37.090
Are you kidding?

33:37.091 --> 33:38.058
Is she kidding?

33:38.059 --> 33:39.559
Of course I must.

33:41.496 --> 33:43.263
This is huge!

33:43.264 --> 33:44.998
Hmm?

33:44.999 --> 33:46.466
I was sure your boss
was going to find you

33:46.467 --> 33:47.534
before I did,,

33:47.535 --> 33:50.004
so I think this is kismet.

33:50.005 --> 33:51.539
Karma.

33:51.540 --> 33:52.640
Fate.

33:54.344 --> 33:55.410
All that stuff.

33:59.478 --> 34:01.912
Get that set up.

34:01.913 --> 34:03.279
Who are you?

34:04.982 --> 34:06.015
Who, me?

34:06.016 --> 34:07.650
Just a guy...

34:07.651 --> 34:09.518
With lots of money,

34:09.518 --> 34:12.487
and people.

34:12.487 --> 34:13.655
I like to get my hands on

34:13.656 --> 34:17.625
rare stuff, you know?

34:17.626 --> 34:20.092
Why, did you think I
was someone a bit cooler?

34:24.031 --> 34:26.065
An abnormal?

34:26.065 --> 34:28.100
Hmm?

34:28.101 --> 34:29.568
[Laughs]

34:29.569 --> 34:31.136
Don't I wish it.

34:31.137 --> 34:33.905
But you just wait.

34:33.906 --> 34:35.473
What are you...

34:35.474 --> 34:36.474
What are you going to do to me?

34:38.076 --> 34:40.944
You mean you haven't worked it out yet?

34:40.945 --> 34:43.478
Okay, so you know that
little thing inside of you?

34:43.480 --> 34:45.380
It's like a
dial-an-earthquake

34:45.382 --> 34:46.614
in a box.

34:46.616 --> 34:49.583
You see, you are...

34:49.585 --> 34:51.386
Psychically cod to...

34:51.387 --> 34:53.955
Kali.

34:55.322 --> 34:57.123
Yeah.

34:57.125 --> 34:59.292
Well, I was going to
say big Bertha, but sure.

34:59.293 --> 35:02.996
Big Bertha?

35:02.997 --> 35:04.297
And Kali...

35:05.266 --> 35:06.332
One and the same.

35:06.333 --> 35:07.534
I know, I know,

35:07.535 --> 35:08.368
you thought she was dead.

35:08.369 --> 35:09.602
So did everybody

35:09.603 --> 35:11.204
thanks to sheriff Magnus,

35:11.205 --> 35:12.638
[laughs]

35:12.639 --> 35:15.174
But she's still alive and kicking,

35:15.175 --> 35:18.043
and whoever has that
bug inside of them...

35:18.044 --> 35:19.411
They control her.

35:20.714 --> 35:22.081
So, my friend here is going to hit you

35:22.082 --> 35:23.716
with a low-frequency magnetic pulse,

35:23.717 --> 35:26.118
and I'm not going to lie to you,

that little thing is
not going to like it,

35:29.022 --> 35:30.589
no, not one little bit...

35:32.858 --> 35:34.192
But to tell you the truth,

35:34.193 --> 35:36.727
it's the only way to get
the bug out, all right?

35:36.728 --> 35:38.363
So... sorry, Will.

35:42.667 --> 35:44.501
Wait a second.

What have you done?

36:37.179 --> 36:39.346
Relax, he's perfectly okay.

36:39.347 --> 36:42.415
You just need to send your signal out,

36:42.416 --> 36:43.716
don't you, little buddy,

36:43.717 --> 36:47.486
before you're ready for your new home.

36:52.158 --> 36:53.159
Henry's en route.

36:53.160 --> 36:54.260
Good.

36:54.261 --> 36:56.461
I need a detailed list
of all naval traffic

36:56.462 --> 36:58.629
within a 500-kilometer radius

36:58.630 --> 37:00.228

[Alerts beeping]

37:01.597 --> 37:03.364

a disturbance in Mumbai.

We need to let Kate know.

37:21.980 --> 37:23.447
I will.

into systemic failure.

with toxic antibodies.

43:44.778 --> 43:46.112
What? He's been poisoned?

43:46.113 --> 43:48.014
No, the makri, it must
have been removed by force.

43:48.015 --> 43:49.414
It would have released these toxins.

43:49.415 --> 43:51.283
But I thought the hosts
can't survive without it.

Hey...

44:13.911 --> 44:15.512
God, he looks terrible.

44:15.513 --> 44:16.647
Unfortunately,

44:16.648 --> 44:18.717
the makri's absence
from his nervous system

44:18.718 --> 44:20.519
is causing a hypersensitive
immune response.

44:21.520 --> 44:23.655
I've stabilized him for now,

44:23.656 --> 44:26.124
reduced the fevers,
prevented more seizures.

44:26.125 --> 44:27.658
We're running tests.

44:27.659 --> 44:29.426
I know of a few treatments

44:29.427 --> 44:31.162
that could slow his decline,

44:31.163 --> 44:32.832
but we simply don't know
enough about the makri

44:32.833 --> 44:34.200
or its effect on his physiology.

44:35.636 --> 44:37.904
Any sign of Bertha?

44:37.905 --> 44:40.039
All our resources are being
diverted to the search,

44:40.040 --> 44:41.274
but it'll take time.

44:41.275 --> 44:43.509
She could be thousands
of miles away by now.

44:43.510 --> 44:45.578
Hey, don't beat yourself up about it.

44:45.579 --> 44:46.712
You did what you had to do.

44:48.448 --> 44:50.449
I wish it were that simple.

44:50.450 --> 44:54.018
The truth is, I broke the rule
that I myself set into place.

44:54.019 --> 44:55.686
I knew it would come back
and haunt me sooner or later.

44:55.687 --> 44:59.057
No, doc, there is a
psychic link to a parasite

44:59.058 --> 45:00.492
and an ancient cult.

45:00.493 --> 45:03.462
Abnormals all over the
world are acting crazy.

45:03.463 --> 45:04.897
I would say that your hunch

45:04.898 --> 45:05.999
about Bertha being
connected to the eco-system

45:06.000 --> 45:07.200
is on the money.

45:07.201 --> 45:09.136
She could destroy millions of lives.

45:09.137 --> 45:10.471
And by killing her,

45:10.472 --> 45:11.605
she could destroy millions of lives,

45:11.606 --> 45:12.840
so what kind of choice is that?

45:12.841 --> 45:17.178
Look, it happened...

45:17.179 --> 45:20.916
So we improvise, we fix it.

45:20.917 --> 45:22.985
What else can I do?

45:24.654 --> 45:25.954
Find out if Henry's made it

45:25.955 --> 45:27.289
to the lead search ship.

45:27.290 --> 45:29.191
Patch him through when he's ready.

45:29.192 --> 45:31.195
Done.

45:46.313 --> 45:49.148
Bertha's magnetic burst

45:49.149 --> 45:51.816
definitely caused a spike in weirdness.

45:51.817 --> 45:54.649
I've adjusted our navigation
systems to compensate.

45:54.650 --> 45:57.083
Also, Declan's reporting more incidents

45:57.084 --> 45:58.583
of abnormals appearing in public,

45:58.584 --> 45:59.884

45:59.885 --> 46:01.686
Yes, I've been getting messages

46:01.687 --> 46:03.320
from heads of sanctuaries
all over the world.

46:03.321 --> 46:04.989
Things are only getting worse.

46:04.990 --> 46:07.158
Hey, doc, listen, about Bertha.

46:07.159 --> 46:08.259
I'm really sorry I wasn't there to help.

46:08.260 --> 46:09.427
You were in the air, Henry.

46:09.428 --> 46:10.261
There's nothing you could've done.

46:10.262 --> 46:11.562
Yeah...

46:11.563 --> 46:12.528
Okay, so we lost round one.

46:12.529 --> 46:13.926
What's our next move?

46:13.927 --> 46:17.528
We need to re-establish contact
with Bertha's tracking device.

46:17.529 --> 46:18.895
Yeah, bad guys have got her

46:18.896 --> 46:20.796
under some sort of a jamming cloak.

46:20.797 --> 46:22.030
None of my scans are
picking anything up.

46:22.031 --> 46:23.764
Who the hell could've done this?

46:23.765 --> 46:26.600
Someone with major connections
in the abnormal world.

46:26.601 --> 46:27.902
It's far more than that.

46:27.903 --> 46:29.671
This is someone who has put together

46:29.672 --> 46:31.872
pieces of information that
are thousands of years old...

46:31.873 --> 46:34.741
the cult of Kali, the makri,
its connection to Bertha.

46:34.742 --> 46:36.209
Who everybody believed was dead.

46:36.210 --> 46:38.678
Yeah, you know, this whole cult thing,

46:38.679 --> 46:40.180
I mean, that's got to be,
like, biblical old, huh?

46:40.181 --> 46:41.714
Older, in fact.

46:41.715 --> 46:44.116
There are legends of abnormals
who were movers of earth,

46:44.117 --> 46:45.717
heralds of the great floods,

46:45.718 --> 46:47.785
the whisperers who could
talk to all creatures.

46:47.786 --> 46:49.020
All these predate

46:49.021 --> 46:51.021
even the earliest egyptian dynasties.

46:51.022 --> 46:52.289
Someone studied this

46:52.290 --> 46:54.024
as though it were all fact, not myth,

46:54.025 --> 46:55.292
and now they have control

46:55.293 --> 46:57.961
of the most dangerous abnormal on earth.

46:57.962 --> 46:59.595
I want to know who we're dealing with

46:59.596 --> 47:00.963
and where they've taken her.

47:00.964 --> 47:02.631
Get us back in the game, Henry.

47:21.282 --> 47:24.117
We're almost in position, Mr. Forsythe.

50:17.830 --> 50:20.566
the herald will see her
as a beautiful enchantress

50:20.567 --> 50:21.834
when the connection is strong,

50:21.835 --> 50:24.102
"with color so vibrant
so as to blind a man."

50:24.103 --> 50:25.603
It does say that.

50:25.604 --> 50:29.807
So why am I seeing nothing
when I'm connected to Bertha?

50:31.643 --> 50:32.676
Come on.

50:34.345 --> 50:37.514
I brought you here as my tech support,

50:37.515 --> 50:39.582
and it's my first time as a herald.

50:41.518 --> 50:46.388
I'm not going to get nasty with you...

50:46.389 --> 50:47.456
But he might.

50:51.528 --> 50:54.229
Kali only comes to the mind's eye

50:54.230 --> 50:56.331
when the makri wills it so.

50:56.332 --> 51:00.701
You are not its chosen host.

51:00.702 --> 51:02.669
You will never see
her mind inside yours.

51:02.670 --> 51:05.105
So I don't get fries with my happy meal.

51:05.106 --> 51:06.740
[Whimpers mockingly]

51:06.741 --> 51:07.774
You're not a herald,

51:07.775 --> 51:09.476
and you never will be.

51:09.477 --> 51:10.510
[Spits]

51:10.511 --> 51:13.279
Oh, really?

51:13.280 --> 51:15.681
That's funny, because
I thought I was the one

51:15.682 --> 51:20.719
who made her crawl 200
miles across the ocean floor.

51:20.720 --> 51:22.554
I'm the one with the
critter inside of me.

51:22.555 --> 51:24.690
I think Bertha will do whatever I want.

51:24.691 --> 51:26.057
Such as?

51:26.058 --> 51:28.560
What do the ancient texts foretell?

51:30.663 --> 51:34.832
The great flood will
come and sweep away sins.

51:34.833 --> 51:37.301
The earth swallowing up

51:37.302 --> 51:38.869
our unclean.

51:38.870 --> 51:42.173
Every single holy man has
predicted Bertha's awakening

51:42.174 --> 51:44.842
since the beginning of
time, and guess what?

51:46.744 --> 51:49.880
They're right.

51:50.948 --> 51:52.683
They're right.

51:53.651 --> 51:54.652
Bibi...

51:54.653 --> 51:58.756
It's the end of days.

52:25.013 --> 52:25.946
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

52:25.947 --> 52:29.483
Ah... do not do that.

52:29.484 --> 52:30.517
Do what?

52:30.518 --> 52:31.885
Follow me like that.

52:31.886 --> 52:33.920
You're looking for the
ones who hurt the white man.

52:33.921 --> 52:34.954
The ones who took my bibi.

52:34.955 --> 52:36.122
You saw them?

52:37.424 --> 52:39.058
The, uh...

52:39.059 --> 52:40.526
the white guy is pretty sick right now.

52:40.527 --> 52:41.728
Sick?

52:41.729 --> 52:42.895
But he has a makri inside him.

52:42.896 --> 52:44.830
Not anymore.

52:44.831 --> 52:46.098
[Sighs]

52:46.099 --> 52:48.567
That's very bad.

52:48.568 --> 52:51.070
Dr. Magnus?

52:51.071 --> 52:52.371
Have you heard from Henry?

52:52.372 --> 52:53.572
Still trying to steal back satellites

52:53.573 --> 52:55.007
to pick up Bertha's trail.

52:55.008 --> 52:56.542
He's going through
every ship in the area

52:56.543 --> 52:57.676
at the time she escaped.

52:57.677 --> 53:00.545
So far all their stories check out.

53:00.546 --> 53:02.047
He's looking for false
registries, shell companies...

53:02.048 --> 53:03.849
it's all taking too long.

53:03.850 --> 53:05.817
Bertha's been gone
more than 12 hours now.

53:05.818 --> 53:07.552
Someone has control of her.

53:07.553 --> 53:09.554
Declan's reporting
more abnormals worldwide

53:09.555 --> 53:10.822
wreaking havoc.

53:10.823 --> 53:12.123
Controlling the spin
on that many sightings,

53:12.124 --> 53:13.091
not easy.

53:13.092 --> 53:15.160
And will, I mean...

53:15.161 --> 53:17.996
He's speaking more hindI now
than English when he talks.

53:17.997 --> 53:19.164
He keeps calling out for Kali.

53:19.165 --> 53:20.899
Quite possibly a side effect

53:20.900 --> 53:23.101
of having the makri forcibly removed.

53:23.102 --> 53:24.069
It isn't.

53:24.070 --> 53:25.270
This is Arjuna.

53:25.271 --> 53:27.706
He says he's a member of the cult.

53:27.707 --> 53:29.208
Tell them what you told me.

53:29.209 --> 53:30.909
Your friend is still connected to Kali.

53:30.910 --> 53:32.911
Are you certain?

53:32.912 --> 53:35.514
If he still sees her in his dreams,

53:35.515 --> 53:37.149
they can speak.

53:37.150 --> 53:38.583
Kali's an apsara.

53:38.584 --> 53:40.919
A sea spirit.

53:40.920 --> 53:42.120
Bertha?

53:42.121 --> 53:43.956
Once the makri chooses its host,

53:43.957 --> 53:46.191
that bond can't be undone,

53:46.192 --> 53:47.759
even when the makri is gone.

53:47.760 --> 53:50.195
Can he sense this apsara, control it?

53:50.196 --> 53:51.797
Not without the makri to help him.

53:51.798 --> 53:53.798
He's helpless.

53:53.799 --> 53:55.633
Unless they call her in a rapati sungu.

53:55.634 --> 53:57.235
Rapati sungu?

53:57.236 --> 53:59.036
He must dance for her.

53:59.037 --> 54:00.438
Dance for her?

54:00.439 --> 54:03.140
If he dances a song for
her, she will hear him.

54:03.141 --> 54:04.508
If he dances well,

54:04.509 --> 54:06.111
she will listen to whatever he says.

54:06.112 --> 54:07.112
Are you sure about this?

54:07.113 --> 54:08.480
Of course.

54:08.481 --> 54:09.781
I am to be a host when I am older.

54:09.782 --> 54:11.616
I've been training
since I was very young.

54:11.617 --> 54:13.118
[Telephone rings]

54:15.755 --> 54:18.790
Infirmary, go ahead.

54:18.791 --> 54:19.992
You have a visitor.

54:22.795 --> 54:24.996
[Wexford]: You took Bertha
to the woods to kill her,

54:24.997 --> 54:26.098
and you never pulled the trigger.

54:26.099 --> 54:27.099
The optics on that are...

54:27.100 --> 54:29.201
Oh, to hell with the optics, Terrance.

54:29.202 --> 54:31.069
It was my choice not to kill her.

54:31.070 --> 54:32.237
If I thought it would be popular,

54:32.238 --> 54:34.005
I wouldn't have kept it secret.

54:34.006 --> 54:35.307
Well, the only problem with lying

54:35.308 --> 54:37.242
is getting caught.

54:37.243 --> 54:40.678
What are you saying?

54:40.679 --> 54:41.946
I'm saying that 80...

54:41.947 --> 54:43.948
50 years ago, even,

54:43.949 --> 54:46.250
no one would have
challenged you on this,

54:46.251 --> 54:48.753
but things have changed.

54:48.754 --> 54:50.654
Helen, I'm sure you did
what you thought was best,

54:50.655 --> 54:51.889
and at the time, it
probably was, but now...

54:51.890 --> 54:54.625
I couldn't have known about the makri,

54:54.626 --> 54:56.193
or that someone would
have figured out a way

54:56.194 --> 54:57.527
to control Bertha remotely.

54:57.528 --> 54:59.296
And I know you took every precaution,

54:59.297 --> 55:00.630
but it still happened.

55:01.866 --> 55:04.634
Look, this isn't even about credibility.

55:04.635 --> 55:06.235
It's becoming about trust.

55:07.804 --> 55:10.639
You need to contain
this situation quickly.

55:10.640 --> 55:12.774
We need to find whoever's
controlling Bertha

55:12.775 --> 55:14.209
and sever the connection.

55:14.210 --> 55:16.778
Once I get her back into
containment again, then I...

55:16.779 --> 55:18.713
Containment?

55:18.714 --> 55:20.881
Helen, Bertha is a threat

55:20.882 --> 55:22.216
to every living creature on this planet,

55:22.217 --> 55:23.150
and you want to put her back in her box?

55:23.151 --> 55:25.018
This issue is far larger

55:25.019 --> 55:26.953
than you could possibly understand.

55:26.954 --> 55:29.322
Killing her is a last resort.

55:29.323 --> 55:31.124
The other heads of house agree.

55:31.125 --> 55:32.225
It would be far too reckless.

55:32.226 --> 55:36.129
Yes, some feel that way,

55:36.130 --> 55:37.263
but not all...

55:38.899 --> 55:41.167
And Helen, the tides are turning.

55:41.168 --> 55:44.571
We've known each other for a long time,

55:44.572 --> 55:47.073
and I owe you everything...

55:48.943 --> 55:51.944
But you need to rethink
your stand on this.

55:51.945 --> 55:55.148
You're on thinner ice than you realize.

55:59.620 --> 56:01.020
[Henry]] There were about
18 ships in the vicinity

56:01.021 --> 56:02.688
when Bertha was taken.

56:02.689 --> 56:04.757
Now, at first blush,
most of them check out.

56:04.758 --> 56:08.628
You got oil tankers, cargo
ships, fishing trawlers.

56:08.629 --> 56:10.797
No connective tissue
between any of them.

56:10.798 --> 56:12.332
But you found something.

56:12.333 --> 56:14.200
Yeah. Hi!

56:14.201 --> 56:15.835
Yeah, I hacked into the databases

56:15.836 --> 56:17.303
of a few fortune 500 companies,

56:17.304 --> 56:19.404
and I cross-referenced
their boards of directors.

56:19.405 --> 56:21.406
You know, those guys make
a whole bunch of money

56:21.407 --> 56:23.308
for doing pretty much nothing?

56:23.309 --> 56:25.043
And?

56:25.044 --> 56:28.012
And, well, one of the
guys sits on the board

56:28.013 --> 56:30.014
of every company that
had ships in the region

56:30.015 --> 56:31.849
where Bertha was hijacked.

56:31.850 --> 56:33.718
Here you go.

56:33.719 --> 56:35.320
This is Edward Forsythe.

56:35.321 --> 56:36.722
Now, he's a big player

56:36.723 --> 56:38.157
in the global geo-mining biz, okay.

56:38.158 --> 56:40.326
This guy owns half of the oil rigs

56:40.327 --> 56:41.593
in the Gulf of Mexico

56:41.594 --> 56:45.698
and the North sea oil
project, all right?

56:45.699 --> 56:48.033
And he was in Mumbai
when all this went down.

56:48.034 --> 56:50.102
I've met him before.

56:50.103 --> 56:52.171
He approached me at a
conference years ago,

56:52.172 --> 56:53.272
asked all sorts of questions

56:53.273 --> 56:55.875
about abnormals in ancient mythology.

56:55.876 --> 56:57.110
[Waves crashing] Oh, sorry .

56:57.111 --> 57:00.013
It's a bit rough in here.

57:00.014 --> 57:03.215
So I don't know how
he knows what he knows,

57:03.216 --> 57:05.117
yet,

57:05.118 --> 57:07.286
but he did buy a lot
of ancient artifacts

57:07.287 --> 57:09.321
from museums over the last few years

57:09.322 --> 57:11.157
for, like, insane amounts of money.

57:11.158 --> 57:12.258
What kind of artifacts?

57:12.259 --> 57:14.026
Totems, scrolls, ancient texts.

57:14.027 --> 57:16.328
It's all shroud-of-turin
Indiana-Jones stuff.

57:16.329 --> 57:17.797
He believes every abnormal can be traced

57:17.798 --> 57:19.799
to a certain region of Pangea,

57:19.800 --> 57:21.834
going back, like, millions of years.

57:21.835 --> 57:23.269
The original super-continent?

57:23.270 --> 57:25.237
That's an interesting
theory, but there's no proof.

57:25.238 --> 57:27.307
So what does a billionaire
art collector want

57:27.308 --> 57:28.842
with an earthquake monster?

57:28.843 --> 57:31.311
Well, controlling Bertha's
like having the ultimate nuke.

57:31.312 --> 57:32.912
I mean, he could be using her

57:32.913 --> 57:34.013
to leverage oil rights

57:34.014 --> 57:35.315
anywhere in the world.

57:35.316 --> 57:37.450
Political blackmail
for business contracts.

57:37.451 --> 57:41.721
Any coastal city is in
jeopardy if he lets her loose.

57:41.722 --> 57:43.489
No.

57:43.490 --> 57:45.191
That's a lot of risk for a little gain.

57:45.192 --> 57:46.692
I mean, the guy definitely

57:46.693 --> 57:47.793
doesn't need the money.

57:47.794 --> 57:50.829
Then what on earth is he up to?

57:53.100 --> 57:58.438
You think they're onto
me, Magnus and her crew?

57:58.439 --> 58:01.040
Yeah, I think they're onto me.

58:01.041 --> 58:03.242
Not that it matters.

58:03.243 --> 58:05.478
They have no idea what I'm up to.

58:05.479 --> 58:07.413
They're probably digging
up the auction sale

58:07.414 --> 58:09.916
from the canopic jar of
shtabi from the London museum.

58:09.917 --> 58:12.918
They should've bought it
from a numbered company.

58:15.722 --> 58:17.322
We're never going to be pals, are we?

58:17.323 --> 58:18.924
[Scoffs]

58:18.925 --> 58:20.993
You're afraid.

58:20.994 --> 58:22.160
You should be.

58:24.297 --> 58:26.064
Sorry about the delay, sir.

58:26.065 --> 58:28.133
Bertha's proximity

58:28.134 --> 58:29.835
is playing havoc with our navigation.

58:29.836 --> 58:31.770
Yeah, well, we were about to
start swapping puke stories.

58:31.771 --> 58:33.171
What's new?

58:33.172 --> 58:34.439
She's made good progress, sir.

58:34.440 --> 58:35.807
She's at the designated coordinates now.

58:35.808 --> 58:38.210
So we're ready for phase two?

58:38.211 --> 58:39.578
Collateral damage?

58:39.579 --> 58:41.046
We anticipate major seismic activities

58:41.047 --> 58:42.848
associated with her actions.

58:42.849 --> 58:44.416
Coastal areas will be hit very hard.

58:44.417 --> 58:46.919
That's a damn shame.

58:48.187 --> 58:49.755
Let's get it started.

58:49.756 --> 58:51.156
Right.

59:03.035 --> 59:05.804
Come on, girl, let's go to work.

59:22.223 --> 59:24.391
Where have you been?

59:41.136 --> 59:42.903
Come.

01:00:16.535 --> 01:00:18.469
You have been looking for me?

01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:22.039
That depends if this is real or not.

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:25.443
I am real, Durga.

01:00:25.444 --> 01:00:27.511
As real as you.

01:00:27.512 --> 01:00:31.015
Why do you call me that?

01:00:31.016 --> 01:00:33.284
Durga.

01:00:33.285 --> 01:00:36.219
It is your name.

01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:39.122
Don't tell me you have
forgotten mine as well?

01:00:41.125 --> 01:00:43.527
Kali.

01:00:46.531 --> 01:00:50.567
You should have not
disappeared like that.

01:00:50.568 --> 01:00:52.268
Where did you go?

01:00:52.269 --> 01:00:55.338
The thing that connects
us was taken from me.

01:00:55.339 --> 01:00:57.974
The makri?

01:00:57.975 --> 01:00:59.408
And you allowed this?

01:00:59.409 --> 01:01:02.411
I didn't have much of a choice...

01:11:24.115 --> 01:11:25.216
The great flood!

01:11:27.252 --> 01:11:30.153
The great flood is coming!

01:11:49.973 --> 01:11:52.074
We're almost at the coordinates.

01:11:52.075 --> 01:11:53.508
Anything yet?

01:11:53.509 --> 01:11:55.610
Yeah, reports of seismic
activity in the area,

01:11:55.611 --> 01:11:57.445
low-grade, but pretty constant.

01:11:57.446 --> 01:11:59.380
I'd say we've got to
be getting pretty close.

01:12:01.683 --> 01:12:04.384
I'm just getting some
weird mapping data here.

01:12:06.187 --> 01:12:08.020
Okay, that's just crazy.

01:12:08.021 --> 01:12:09.355
What is it?

01:12:09.356 --> 01:12:11.191
I'm cross-checking with
our nautical charts.

01:12:11.192 --> 01:12:12.125
Just hold on.

01:12:15.596 --> 01:12:17.164
Okay, either we're totally off course,

01:12:17.165 --> 01:12:19.132
or...

01:12:19.133 --> 01:12:21.702
Doc, I'm reading a chain
of Islands dead ahead,

01:12:21.703 --> 01:12:23.204
but there's nothing in the charts

01:12:23.205 --> 01:12:24.372
indicating any land mass,

01:12:24.373 --> 01:12:25.706
just open ocean.

01:12:25.707 --> 01:12:27.441
That's because it's new.

01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:36.551
She's not making earthquakes.

01:12:36.552 --> 01:12:38.719
She's making land.

01:12:43.258 --> 01:12:45.492
This is Magnus. We have a complication.

01:12:45.493 --> 01:12:47.194
Are you getting these images?

01:12:47.195 --> 01:12:48.462
Yes, we are.

01:12:48.463 --> 01:12:50.464
Sonar indicates tectonic
plates are diverging rapidly.

01:12:51.666 --> 01:12:53.467
We're also detecting a smaller vessel

01:12:53.468 --> 01:12:55.302
approximately six miles
West of your position.

01:12:55.303 --> 01:12:56.770
What do you want to bet it's Forsythe?

01:12:56.771 --> 01:12:57.738
This is the captain.

01:12:57.739 --> 01:12:59.139
We're moving to intercept.

01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:01.608
Don't! He's got control of Bertha.

01:13:01.609 --> 01:13:03.310
If we try taking his ship,

01:13:03.311 --> 01:13:04.478
there's no telling what he'll do.

01:13:04.479 --> 01:13:06.046
That's why he's out here alone.

01:13:06.047 --> 01:13:07.414
He has tte ultimate bodyguard.

01:13:07.415 --> 01:13:08.949
If she keeps building
land at this rate...

01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:12.186
it'll cause massive destruction
to the entire region, I know.

01:13:12.187 --> 01:13:13.621
We're circling around,

01:13:13.622 --> 01:13:15.288
trying to get a better
lock on her position.

01:13:17.792 --> 01:13:20.293
Copy that. Standing by.

01:13:20.294 --> 01:13:22.362
Ready deployment of all depth charges.

01:13:22.363 --> 01:13:25.164
If she can't finish this, we will.

01:13:26.733 --> 01:13:28.200
Yes, sir.

01:13:31.537 --> 01:13:33.371
Ravi!

01:13:33.372 --> 01:13:34.539
People are saying

01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:36.574
there's something happening
a few streets over.

01:13:47.553 --> 01:13:48.720
Henry?

01:13:48.721 --> 01:13:50.588
I can't get a shot.

01:13:50.589 --> 01:13:53.224
We didn't anticipate her making Islands,

01:13:53.225 --> 01:13:54.459
and they're kind of in the way.

01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:55.426
Dammit.

01:13:55.427 --> 01:13:57.128
What do you want me to do, doc?

01:13:58.230 --> 01:14:00.330
Target Forsythe's ship.

01:14:01.766 --> 01:14:03.233
Forsythe's ship?

01:14:03.234 --> 01:14:04.801
If we can't get a shot at Bertha,

01:14:04.802 --> 01:14:06.203
we might be able to use the l-rad

01:14:06.204 --> 01:14:07.738
to sever his connection to her.

01:14:08.773 --> 01:14:10.240
Oh, man...

01:14:13.344 --> 01:14:15.745
Kali!

01:14:15.746 --> 01:14:16.646
Kali, you must stop!

01:14:16.647 --> 01:14:18.281
The end of days...

01:14:19.883 --> 01:14:21.417
I must...

01:14:21.418 --> 01:14:23.220
I must find her.

01:14:23.221 --> 01:14:25.656
How can I find her?

01:14:30.361 --> 01:14:33.398
Dance...

01:14:33.399 --> 01:14:36.501
[Laughing feverishly]

01:14:36.502 --> 01:14:38.938
I can dance!

01:14:38.939 --> 01:14:41.174
[Drumbeats surge]

01:14:51.482 --> 01:14:54.317
I can dance!

01:14:57.321 --> 01:14:58.955
Kali!

01:16:22.444 --> 01:16:23.911
Kali!

01:16:32.286 --> 01:16:34.287
Damn, I'm losing her.

01:16:34.288 --> 01:16:35.655
Mr. Forsythe, we're
tracking a lone helicopter

01:16:35.656 --> 01:16:36.990
closing in on our position.

01:16:38.393 --> 01:16:39.426
Mr. Forsythe...

01:16:41.362 --> 01:16:42.429
Mr. Forsythe?

01:16:42.430 --> 01:16:44.898
It's Magnus. Shoot her down.

01:16:53.007 --> 01:16:55.776
Doc!

01:16:55.777 --> 01:16:57.912
We have a weapons lock on our position!

01:16:59.347 --> 01:17:00.447
He's got missiles?

01:17:00.448 --> 01:17:01.682
Of course he does.

01:17:13.390 --> 01:17:15.224
Deploying countermeasures. Hang on!

01:17:21.632 --> 01:17:22.632
[Laughing]: Yeah!

01:17:22.633 --> 01:17:24.400
Nice move, doc!

01:17:24.401 --> 01:17:27.402
Get ready to fire the weapon!

01:17:27.403 --> 01:17:31.339
We have missed the target.
20 seconds to reload.

01:17:37.481 --> 01:17:39.382
[Crowd murmurs in confusion]

01:17:44.821 --> 01:17:46.555
Namaskarr, Durga.

01:17:46.556 --> 01:17:48.491
[Panting wearily]

01:17:48.492 --> 01:17:49.658
Namaskarr, Kali.

01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:55.764
Sir, Bertha's slowing down.

01:17:55.765 --> 01:17:57.199
Her rate of volcanic
activity is decreasing.

01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:59.701
Come on, stay with me.

01:17:59.702 --> 01:18:00.669
I have a shot!

01:18:00.670 --> 01:18:01.436
Take it!

01:18:08.343 --> 01:18:09.644
He was here.

01:18:09.645 --> 01:18:11.412
People saw him only a few minutes ago.

01:18:11.413 --> 01:18:12.580
I know, I got the same story,

01:18:12.581 --> 01:18:13.548
and something about a...

01:18:13.549 --> 01:18:15.349
dancing, and apparently, quite well.

01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:17.285
Will dancing?

01:18:17.286 --> 01:18:18.286
Pull our people back.

01:18:18.287 --> 01:18:19.554
What?

01:18:19.555 --> 01:18:20.755
The dance, the rapati sungu.

01:18:20.756 --> 01:18:22.358
He's trying to reach Bertha.

01:18:22.359 --> 01:18:24.458
Get our people away from him.

01:18:24.459 --> 01:18:26.427
[Speaking Hindi]

01:18:29.197 --> 01:18:30.398
It worked.

01:18:30.399 --> 01:18:32.199
You heard me.

01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:34.334
You summoned me.

01:18:35.636 --> 01:18:36.803
Kali...

01:18:38.539 --> 01:18:41.474
Please, stop what you're doing.

01:18:42.676 --> 01:18:45.244
The makri is telling
me that there is danger.

01:18:45.245 --> 01:18:47.513
You said your makri was taken from you.

01:18:47.514 --> 01:18:51.282
I know, but...

01:18:51.283 --> 01:18:52.550
I can still feel you.

01:18:54.586 --> 01:18:55.753
What you're doing...

01:18:55.754 --> 01:18:57.621
Is what I am asked to do.

01:18:57.622 --> 01:19:01.591
If you don't stop,
millions of people will die.

01:19:02.793 --> 01:19:05.194
Then they will die.

01:19:07.466 --> 01:19:08.934
But this herald...

01:19:10.803 --> 01:19:13.205
He doesn't respect you.

01:19:13.206 --> 01:19:14.774
He's only using you for his own gain.

01:19:14.775 --> 01:19:16.376
You are different?

01:19:16.377 --> 01:19:17.477
Yes!

01:19:17.478 --> 01:19:19.980
I respect you.

01:19:19.981 --> 01:19:22.416
Your power is incredible,

01:19:22.417 --> 01:19:23.684
but killing innocent people

01:19:23.685 --> 01:19:24.952
is not what you're meant to do.

01:19:24.953 --> 01:19:27.990
I have heard this from
other heralds in the past,

01:19:27.991 --> 01:19:30.426
a request for leniency,

01:19:30.427 --> 01:19:31.527
for mercy.

01:19:31.528 --> 01:19:34.698
People are stronger now.

01:19:34.699 --> 01:19:38.001
If you hurt them,

01:19:38.002 --> 01:19:40.303
they'll hurt you back.

01:19:41.604 --> 01:19:43.938
I only wish to be left alone.

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:49.307
What's Bertha doing now?

01:19:49.308 --> 01:19:51.642
Scans indicate...

01:19:51.643 --> 01:19:54.377
She's inactive!

01:19:54.378 --> 01:19:56.345
I think it worked!

01:19:56.346 --> 01:19:57.279
Magnus, did you hit the target?

01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:58.047
[Magnus]: She's quiet.

01:19:58.048 --> 01:20:00.416
But still conscious?

01:20:00.417 --> 01:20:02.084
[Magnus]: Yes.

01:20:02.085 --> 01:20:04.285
We should be able to guide her
back to her containment area.

01:20:05.388 --> 01:20:06.521
I'm heading back to the ship.

01:20:06.522 --> 01:20:08.823
We'll regroup for the next phase.

01:20:08.824 --> 01:20:10.691
Understood.

01:20:12.293 --> 01:20:13.827
Captain...

01:20:13.828 --> 01:20:16.998
Deploy all depth charges
to Bertha's position.

01:20:16.999 --> 01:20:18.733
Target her with everything we have.

01:20:18.734 --> 01:20:20.568
Right now.

01:20:20.569 --> 01:20:21.836
Yes, sir.

01:20:21.837 --> 01:20:23.037
Ready all ordnance.

01:20:23.038 --> 01:20:24.706
All charges, maximum depth.

01:20:24.707 --> 01:20:27.575
All charges max depth. Aye, sir.

01:20:27.576 --> 01:20:29.744
And cut off all Magnus'
radio communications

01:20:29.745 --> 01:20:33.015
with the other ships.

01:20:34.317 --> 01:20:36.351
Why was I asked to make land?

01:20:36.352 --> 01:20:38.852
Oh, I don't know,

01:20:38.853 --> 01:20:40.887
but you don't have to do what he says.

01:20:42.822 --> 01:20:46.022
Please...

01:20:46.023 --> 01:20:48.758
You danced well for me, Durga.

01:20:48.759 --> 01:20:50.460
[Laughing]

01:20:50.461 --> 01:20:53.929
Well, I... I didn't
have much of a choice.

01:20:53.930 --> 01:20:57.800
I had to get your attention, didn't i?

01:21:03.774 --> 01:21:04.840
No!

01:21:04.841 --> 01:21:05.975
Depth charges?

01:21:05.976 --> 01:21:08.711
Terrance, what the hell are you doing?

01:21:09.847 --> 01:21:11.581
Dammit!

01:21:27.564 --> 01:21:28.831
[Screams in pain]

01:21:28.832 --> 01:21:30.099
What? What is it?

01:21:31.568 --> 01:21:32.802
You said you would leave me alone!

01:21:32.803 --> 01:21:33.903
What happened?

01:21:33.904 --> 01:21:37.505
You betrayed me!

01:21:42.911 --> 01:21:43.978
[Gasps in pain]

01:21:43.979 --> 01:21:44.712
Will!

01:21:46.047 --> 01:21:47.648
Will!

01:21:53.621 --> 01:21:55.856
What the hell are you playing at?

01:21:55.857 --> 01:21:57.524
She was calm!

01:21:57.525 --> 01:21:59.159
We had a window of opportunity.

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.861
It had to be done.

01:22:00.862 --> 01:22:02.229
Captain...

01:22:02.230 --> 01:22:04.497
Please escort Mr. Wexford to the brig,

01:22:04.498 --> 01:22:05.932
pending my orders.

01:22:05.933 --> 01:22:07.801
With all respect, ma'am, I can't.

01:22:07.802 --> 01:22:09.602
I received a coded message

01:22:09.603 --> 01:22:11.604
on the secure network frequency.

01:22:11.605 --> 01:22:12.839
Mr. Wexford...

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:14.507
by unanimous consent,

01:22:14.508 --> 01:22:15.941
you are hereby relieved of your command

01:22:15.942 --> 01:22:17.576
of the Sanctuary network,

01:22:17.577 --> 01:22:18.911
effective immediately.

01:22:18.912 --> 01:22:20.012
Dude, you cannot be serious.

01:22:20.013 --> 01:22:22.181
Don't interfere... dude.

01:22:22.182 --> 01:22:24.951
I'm in charge of operations now.

01:22:24.952 --> 01:22:26.953
You're remanded to custody

01:22:26.954 --> 01:22:28.855
pending further disciplinary action.

01:22:28.856 --> 01:22:29.990
You had this planned all along.

01:22:29.991 --> 01:22:32.692
My orders were to take
over if you failed,

01:22:32.693 --> 01:22:34.627
and by letting Bertha
live yet once again,

01:22:34.628 --> 01:22:36.896
you most certainly have.

01:22:36.897 --> 01:22:38.130
I'm sorry, Helen.

01:22:38.131 --> 01:22:39.632
You gave me no choice.

01:22:43.671 --> 01:22:45.572
[Groans groggily]

01:22:57.788 --> 01:22:59.655
You have no idea what you've done.

01:22:59.656 --> 01:23:01.057
I saved lives.

01:23:01.058 --> 01:23:03.126
I did what you refused to do.

01:23:03.127 --> 01:23:05.194
[Sirens and alarms begin wailing]

01:23:05.195 --> 01:23:08.531
No, Terrance, this is what you've done!

01:23:18.906 --> 01:23:21.537
[Chuckling]: Oh...

01:23:25.106 --> 01:23:28.808
Oh, she's mad.
