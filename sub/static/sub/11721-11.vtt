Just got here from
Grand Rapids, Michigan.

03:59.330 --> 04:01.430
15 minutes after he
checks in the hotel,

04:01.432 --> 04:03.399
gets shot at
point-blank range.

04:03.401 --> 04:04.533
Any witnesses?

04:04.535 --> 04:05.834
No, not yet.

04:05.836 --> 04:07.569
His family was at the pool
when the whole thing happened.

04:07.571 --> 04:10.672
From what we can make of it,
it just looks like a robbery.

04:12.575 --> 04:14.676
Well, according to the wife,
the only suitcase that's missing

04:14.678 --> 04:16.245
is the husband's
carry-on.

04:16.247 --> 04:17.913
What was in it?
She doesn't know.

04:17.915 --> 04:21.183
She says it's the only bag
she didn't pack herself.

04:21.185 --> 04:24.353
Okay, so our shooter ignores
all these valuables,

04:24.355 --> 04:26.422
grabs what he came for,
and then just takes off.

04:26.424 --> 04:27.556
GROVER:
Clearly, he was after something

04:27.558 --> 04:28.690
that our victim
brought with him,

04:28.692 --> 04:30.459
and he was willing
to kill for it.

04:30.461 --> 04:32.961
The question is-- what?

04:42.942 --> 04:44.409
LUKELA:
<i>We've been taking statements</i>

at the time of
the shooting.

04:47.548 --> 04:49.281
So far, no one recalls
seeing anyone suspicious.

04:49.283 --> 04:50.582
Okay, what about
security cameras?

04:50.584 --> 04:52.818

Officer Kai,

04:58.158 --> 05:00.092
back in the saddle.

05:02.161 --> 05:05.230
I told Gene here I used to work
this gig over at the Marriott.

05:05.232 --> 05:07.966
He was kind enough
to let me take the wheel.

05:07.968 --> 05:10.035
Well, you still got
the touch, I see.

05:10.037 --> 05:12.370
Indeed, I do.

05:12.372 --> 05:13.738
But, full disclosure,

05:13.740 --> 05:17.075
your window of opportunity
has finally closed.

05:17.077 --> 05:20.846
I've been in an exclusive
relationship for three weeks.

05:20.848 --> 05:23.248
Really?

05:23.250 --> 05:24.783
Hmm, well,
who's the lucky girl?

05:24.785 --> 05:26.785
Her name is Brenda.

05:26.787 --> 05:28.520
Met her at a karaoke bar.

05:28.522 --> 05:32.257
My rendition of "Love Is
a Battlefield" closed the deal.

05:32.259 --> 05:33.525
Bold choice.

05:33.527 --> 05:37.028
I'm sure you hit
those high notes.

05:37.030 --> 05:38.997
Check out this
suitcase.

05:38.999 --> 05:41.399
Yeah, that matches the
description of our stolen bag.

05:41.401 --> 05:42.567
Can you punch in
on those tags?

05:42.569 --> 05:44.035
Sure.

05:44.904 --> 05:47.139
Flight 27 out
of Gerald Ford.

05:47.141 --> 05:48.406
That's the same flight
our victim flew in on.

05:48.430 --> 05:49.609
Then that's our shooter.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.109
Yeah, we still need
to I.D. him.

05:51.111 --> 05:53.044
Can you pull every angle
we have on this guy?

05:53.046 --> 05:54.546
You got it, sistah.

05:55.681 --> 05:57.716
GROVER:
<i>Just heard from the hospital.</i>

05:57.718 --> 05:59.718
The bullet's lodged inches away
from Wallace's heart.

05:59.720 --> 06:03.221
He's in surgery now, but
it's pretty much touch and go.

06:03.223 --> 06:04.789
Well, let's hope
he pulls through.

06:04.791 --> 06:06.158
Yeah.

06:06.160 --> 06:09.261
So I had TSA send over the
X-ray of our stolen bag.

06:09.263 --> 06:11.563
It was scanned right before
Wallace boarded his flight

06:11.565 --> 06:12.864
in Grand Rapids.

06:12.866 --> 06:15.400
GROVER:
What do we got?

06:15.402 --> 06:17.269
Some clothes, toiletries,
couple of magazines.

06:17.271 --> 06:20.172
That's hardly anything worth
shooting somebody over.

06:20.174 --> 06:21.973
Which means there's something
here that we're not seeing.

06:21.975 --> 06:24.643
Or maybe this ain't
about the bag.

06:24.645 --> 06:27.212
You think this robbery might be
a smoke screen for a hit?

06:27.214 --> 06:28.280
Yeah, it could be.

06:28.282 --> 06:29.682
Here we are talking
about a suitcase

06:29.683 --> 06:31.316
instead of asking who
might want Wallace dead.

06:31.318 --> 06:33.485
Well, maybe that's the question
we need to ask.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.755
(man yelling directions
in Japanese)

06:37.823 --> 06:39.791
KAMEKONA: Don't think
this is a good plan, brah.

06:39.793 --> 06:41.693
STEVE:
It's the only one we got.

06:43.863 --> 06:46.131

Uh, my friend,

Hi. <i>Konnichi wa.</i>

06:54.541 --> 06:56.841

06:56.843 --> 06:58.577

06:58.579 --> 06:59.778
I got to rain-check today, chef.

06:59.780 --> 07:01.446
But, uh, I was kind of hoping
you could do

07:01.448 --> 07:03.381
my friend Kamekona
a favor.

07:04.784 --> 07:08.453
Right, well,
you see, chef,

07:08.455 --> 07:09.888
I'm competing in
a shrimp cook-off

07:09.890 --> 07:12.757
and the competition
is mad intense.

07:12.759 --> 07:15.026
I'm gonna really have to
bring it to have a chance.

07:15.028 --> 07:17.562
So we figured-- who better
to help me step up my game

07:17.564 --> 07:19.798
than an actual
Iron Chef.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.967
Oh, you want me
to teach you how to cook?

07:21.969 --> 07:23.568
No.

07:23.570 --> 07:25.637
I want you to teach
me how to win.

07:25.639 --> 07:27.539
Be my sensei.

07:27.541 --> 07:29.808
Like Mr. Myagi
in <i>Karate Kid.</i>

07:30.743 --> 07:31.943
The movie?

07:31.945 --> 07:33.211
Ralph Macchio?

07:33.213 --> 07:34.646
Yes, Pat Morita.

07:35.514 --> 07:37.249
Wax on. Wax off.

07:37.251 --> 07:39.217
Yeah, "paint the fence," yeah.

07:39.219 --> 07:42.254
But I'm not running
cooking school.

07:42.256 --> 07:45.690
So my answer is-- sorry, no.

07:47.159 --> 07:49.060
Okay.

07:49.062 --> 07:50.195
Sorry, big guy. Tried.

07:50.197 --> 07:51.296
That's okay.

07:51.298 --> 07:52.998
Maybe he'll give me a job
washing dishes

07:53.000 --> 07:54.299
when we lose to Choy.

07:54.301 --> 07:55.600
Choy?

07:55.602 --> 07:58.436
You said Sam Choy?
STEVE: Yeah, Sam Choy, yeah.

07:58.438 --> 08:00.171
He's, uh, he's competing
in the cook-off.

08:02.708 --> 08:05.877
Okay, Daniel-San,
I will train you.

08:05.879 --> 08:09.014
And together we will
destroy him, Sam Choy.

08:09.016 --> 08:10.782
STEVE:

08:10.784 --> 08:11.916
Chef, <i>domo arigato.</i> Thank you.

08:11.918 --> 08:12.951
<i>Arigato.</i>

08:12.953 --> 08:14.319
Hey, congratulations.

08:14.321 --> 08:16.021
I'll leave you to it.

08:16.023 --> 08:17.322
Okay?

08:17.324 --> 08:19.324
(cell phone rings)

08:19.326 --> 08:20.692
Yeah, Lou, what do you got?

08:20.694 --> 08:22.560
GROVER: Well, we looked
into our Vic, Bryan Wallace.

08:22.562 --> 08:24.462
This guy sure picked
a hell of a time

08:24.464 --> 08:25.730
to go on a Hawaiian vacation.

08:25.732 --> 08:26.998
Why? What are you talking about?

08:27.000 --> 08:29.834
Wallace lost his job
as a consultant five months ago.

08:29.836 --> 08:31.269
He hasn't collected
a paycheck since.

08:31.271 --> 08:33.371
Wait a minute.
If he's broke and out of work,

08:33.373 --> 08:36.207
what's he doing taking
his family on an expensive trip?

08:36.208 --> 08:39.443
That doesn't make any sense.

08:39.446 --> 08:42.047
Why would he keep something
like that from me?

08:45.685 --> 08:47.285
The kids.

08:47.287 --> 08:49.621
He promised them.

08:49.623 --> 08:51.056
What did he
promise them?

08:51.058 --> 08:55.026
This trip.

08:55.028 --> 08:56.695
They've been talking
about coming to Hawaii

08:56.697 --> 08:59.931
ever since they saw it
on one of their TV shows.

08:59.933 --> 09:01.933
Then last Christmas,

09:01.935 --> 09:05.203
he promised to take them.

09:05.205 --> 09:08.740
If he had told me
what had happened with work,

09:08.742 --> 09:10.508
I would have made him cancel.

09:10.510 --> 09:14.012
I just feel so terrible that he
had to keep all this to himself.

09:14.014 --> 09:15.714
Ma'am, that's not
important right now.

09:15.716 --> 09:20.018
The most important thing is that
your husband gets through this

09:20.020 --> 09:22.387
and he has you and your
children to support him.

09:22.389 --> 09:24.322
Mrs. Wallace, I promise you,
we're gonna do

09:24.324 --> 09:26.524
everything we can to find
out who did this, okay?

09:26.526 --> 09:28.827
Thank you.

09:29.695 --> 09:31.029
I'm gonna go check

09:31.031 --> 09:33.832
with the doctors
to see if they have an update.

09:33.834 --> 09:34.999
Of course.

09:40.172 --> 09:41.673
Tell me something--
how do you keep

09:41.675 --> 09:44.109
your wife in the dark
about something like that?

09:45.277 --> 09:48.380
Well, when the governor took
my badge, I lost my job,

09:48.382 --> 09:50.915
I thought I was never
gonna work again.

09:50.917 --> 09:54.119
Now, I went home and put a brave
face on for Renee and the kids,

09:54.121 --> 09:56.621
but, man...

09:56.623 --> 09:59.124
when you're alone late at night
and you think about the prospect

09:59.126 --> 10:01.192
of not being able to take
care of your family,

10:01.194 --> 10:04.295
you know what kind of a
load that is to carry?

10:04.297 --> 10:06.264
Pride, brother.

10:06.266 --> 10:08.032
It is one of the
seven deadlies.

10:08.034 --> 10:11.636
Makes you do things
you otherwise wouldn't.

10:11.638 --> 10:14.372
All right, so if Wallace is
capable of lying to his family,

10:14.374 --> 10:17.075
what else could
he have been hiding?

10:21.514 --> 10:22.580
If I didn't know any better,

10:22.582 --> 10:24.549
I'd say our shooter's
camera-shy.

10:24.551 --> 10:26.584
KONO:
All right, he definitely knew

10:26.586 --> 10:27.652
where all the cameras
were positioned

10:27.654 --> 10:29.254
and was careful to avoid them.

10:29.256 --> 10:31.623
That's every angle we have.
None of them caught

10:31.625 --> 10:32.891
an image of his face.

10:34.827 --> 10:37.128
Maybe this kid did.

10:38.264 --> 10:39.964
Hotel towel says

10:39.966 --> 10:41.800
he's probably a guest here.

10:41.802 --> 10:42.967
Thanks.

10:48.841 --> 10:52.010
(woman giggling)

10:53.345 --> 10:55.280
Excuse me.

10:59.885 --> 11:01.453
Excuse me.

11:01.455 --> 11:03.555
Yeah, I'm gonna need
to see your phone.

11:03.557 --> 11:05.457
I wasn't looking
at those Web sites.

11:06.392 --> 11:08.193
I swear.
My friend borrowed my cell.

11:08.195 --> 11:09.427
That sounds like
a reasonable defense.

11:09.429 --> 11:10.829
Look, I'm only interested
in the photos

11:10.831 --> 11:12.430
that you took earlier
in the lobby.

11:13.432 --> 11:14.632
So, please,
hand it over.

11:18.003 --> 11:19.204
I'll tell you what.

11:19.839 --> 11:21.105
I'll trade you.

11:21.107 --> 11:22.640
For what?

11:22.642 --> 11:24.375
BOY:
My homeboys are gonna flip

11:24.377 --> 11:25.643
when I send them this.

11:25.645 --> 11:26.544
(phone camera clicks)

11:26.546 --> 11:27.512
(laughs)

11:27.514 --> 11:28.780
Okay, I ever see
that photo online,

11:28.782 --> 11:31.649
you're spending the rest
of your puberty behind bars.

11:34.186 --> 11:36.287
(phone ringing)

11:36.289 --> 11:37.289
Kono, what do you got?

11:37.290 --> 11:38.590
KONO:
An I.D. on our shooter.

11:38.592 --> 11:39.724
He's a Belgian national

11:39.726 --> 11:42.026
named Lukas Janssen.
Interpol has him connected

11:42.028 --> 11:44.229
to a string of high-end
robberies throughout Europe.

11:44.231 --> 11:47.298
Well, how did our Vic get
mixed up with a guy like that?

11:47.300 --> 11:49.567
He didn't. He just shared
a connecting flight with him.

11:49.569 --> 11:51.069
Janssen was coming in
from Antwerp

11:51.071 --> 11:52.470
and he just happened
to be seated

11:52.472 --> 11:53.771
next to the entire
Wallace family.

11:53.773 --> 11:55.640
But this is where it gets
really interesting, though:

11:55.642 --> 11:57.375
While the plane's in the air,

11:57.377 --> 11:59.577
TSA gets word
that Lukas is smuggling

11:59.579 --> 12:01.212
stolen artwork into Hawaii.

12:01.214 --> 12:03.081
But when he lands,
they don't find anything.

12:03.083 --> 12:04.315
CHIN:
So they let him go.

12:04.317 --> 12:05.984
And then, less than
an hour later,

12:05.986 --> 12:07.352
Janssen shoots Bryan Wallace

12:07.354 --> 12:09.354
in his hotel room
and takes only one thing:

12:09.356 --> 12:10.822
a carry-on suitcase
that was stored

12:10.824 --> 12:11.956
in the airplane's cabin--

12:11.958 --> 12:13.892
a suitcase that he had access to

12:13.894 --> 12:14.959
throughout the entire flight.

12:14.961 --> 12:16.995
All right,
Janssen must have suspected

12:16.997 --> 12:18.730
they were gonna search him
when he landed.

12:18.732 --> 12:20.665
So Janssen slips
whatever he's smuggling

12:20.667 --> 12:21.766
into Wallace's bag,

12:21.768 --> 12:24.302
tracks the guy down
at his hotel,

12:24.304 --> 12:26.004
shoots him,
and then gets his bag back.

12:26.006 --> 12:27.639
Well, it looks like
Wallace's luck

12:27.641 --> 12:29.274
just went from bad to worse.

12:49.524 --> 12:50.958
Nicole Booth?

12:50.960 --> 12:53.060
Yes.

12:53.062 --> 12:54.338
Steve McGarrett.
This is Captain Lou Grover.

12:54.362 --> 12:54.863
Ma'am.

12:54.864 --> 12:56.697
I understand
you called TSA

12:56.699 --> 12:57.898
with the tip
about Lukas Janssen.

12:57.900 --> 12:59.333
That's right.
My firm chartered a flight

12:59.335 --> 13:01.669
as soon as we heard
that he was en route.

13:07.209 --> 13:08.609
Wait a minute.
You're an insurance agent?

13:08.611 --> 13:10.378
Recovery specialist.
And if you don't mind,

13:10.380 --> 13:12.747
I'd like to see
Janssen right now.

13:12.749 --> 13:14.215
That's going to be
a little difficult.

13:14.217 --> 13:15.217
We don't have him.

13:15.218 --> 13:16.550
What do you mean?

13:16.552 --> 13:17.752
STEVE:
Janssen got past TSA

13:17.754 --> 13:19.420
by hiding whatever
he was smuggling

13:19.422 --> 13:20.621
in another passenger's bag.

13:20.623 --> 13:22.556
GROVER: Now that passenger's
in surgery,

13:22.558 --> 13:23.758
fighting for his life.

13:23.760 --> 13:24.925
STEVE: Unfortunately,
this isn't just

13:24.927 --> 13:26.127
about a piece
of stolen art.

13:26.129 --> 13:27.689
We're investigating
an attempted murder.

13:29.197 --> 13:30.931
Look, I'm sorry to hear that,

13:30.933 --> 13:33.100
but with all due respect,
I'm working a case, too.

13:33.102 --> 13:34.602
And if I don't
recover that piece,

13:34.604 --> 13:36.904
it's going to cost my firm
$55 million.

13:38.774 --> 13:40.875
What did this guy steal?

13:40.877 --> 13:43.811
NICOLE: Vincent van Gogh's
Vase with Irises.

13:43.813 --> 13:46.647
It was stolen from the
Bremen museum in 2012.

13:46.649 --> 13:48.449
Bishop & Copley
Insurance

13:48.451 --> 13:50.418
holds the policy
and is on the hook

13:50.420 --> 13:52.586
for the full value.

13:52.588 --> 13:54.021
CHIN: All right, well,
according to Interpol,

13:54.023 --> 13:57.091
Janssen was investigated for
the heist, but never charged.

13:57.093 --> 13:58.392
This guy is meticulous
in both planning

13:58.394 --> 13:59.560
and in execution.

13:59.562 --> 14:01.395
I mean, short of
catching him in the act,

14:01.397 --> 14:03.364
your only chance to nail
him is when he surfaces

14:03.366 --> 14:04.665
to unload the artwork.

14:04.667 --> 14:05.766
Which is exactly
why Janssen's here.

14:05.768 --> 14:06.867
STEVE:
Okay, wait a minute.

14:06.869 --> 14:08.436
If this was stolen
three years ago,

14:08.438 --> 14:09.904
why's he only
moving it now?

14:09.906 --> 14:11.605
The hardest part
in trafficking art

14:11.607 --> 14:12.840
isn't just stealing
a painting;

14:12.842 --> 14:14.975
it's converting
it into cash.

14:14.977 --> 14:16.777
Especially when you're
dealing with a Van Gogh.

14:16.779 --> 14:18.746
I mean, there's only
a handful of potential buyers

14:18.748 --> 14:20.414
for a piece like that.

14:20.416 --> 14:22.116
But it just so happens
that the wealthiest

14:22.118 --> 14:23.384
collectors in the
world are gathered

14:23.386 --> 14:24.785
here in Hawaii
this week.

14:24.787 --> 14:25.920
The Pacific Art Forum.

14:25.922 --> 14:27.221
It's a big international
art event

14:27.223 --> 14:28.489
they hold in Honolulu
every year.

14:28.491 --> 14:29.957
And where the legitimate
art world gathers,

14:29.959 --> 14:33.160
there's a black market
that travels with it.

14:33.162 --> 14:34.495
So Janssen's just
following the money.

14:34.497 --> 14:36.864
All right. How does he
go about finding a buyer?

14:36.866 --> 14:38.632
Very carefully.

14:38.634 --> 14:41.068
These transactions
occur in the shadows.

14:41.070 --> 14:42.636
Buyers and sellers communicate
through back channels,

14:42.638 --> 14:44.371
often using a middleman
to broker the deal.

14:44.373 --> 14:46.907
So we find the middleman,
we find Janssen.

14:46.909 --> 14:48.309
CHIN: Why don't I get a list
of attendees at the convention

14:48.311 --> 14:50.177
and run it against the FBI's
art crime database?

14:50.179 --> 14:51.345
NICOLE:
Why bother?

14:51.347 --> 14:52.713
The guy
that we want

14:52.715 --> 14:54.315
isn't in any
criminal database.

14:54.317 --> 14:55.249
Gerard Hirsch.

14:55.251 --> 14:57.084
See, on paper
he's clean.

14:57.086 --> 14:59.086
A respected
art appraiser.

14:59.088 --> 15:02.056
But to insiders,
he's a black market

15:02.058 --> 15:03.991
facilitator, dealing
in stolen art

15:03.993 --> 15:05.726
and high-end
forgeries.

15:05.728 --> 15:07.161
He's also a
notorious perv.

15:07.163 --> 15:08.896
STEVE:
Good.

15:08.898 --> 15:11.499
We'll be able to get
some leverage on him.

15:11.501 --> 15:13.667
We just need some bait.

I should hope not.

18:34.003 --> 18:36.136
He ran the mess
up at Halawa Correctional.

18:36.138 --> 18:39.273
Gave me my first job
in a kitchen.

18:39.275 --> 18:41.675
I became pretty good
at it, too.

18:41.677 --> 18:44.044
My butter shrimp were so famous,

18:44.046 --> 18:47.114
the night guards used
to sneak in the fresh catch.

18:47.116 --> 18:51.151
I used to grill 'em up
in my cell on a hot plate

18:51.153 --> 18:53.554
that ran off a car battery.

18:53.556 --> 18:57.458
Some of the best meals
I ever cooked.

18:58.526 --> 19:00.094
Show me that.

19:02.063 --> 19:03.397
<i>Hai.</i>

19:03.399 --> 19:06.400
♪ ♪

19:27.689 --> 19:29.757
(sizzling)

19:58.586 --> 20:00.821
♪ ♪

20:01.756 --> 20:04.324
This is how you
will beat Choy.

20:05.126 --> 20:07.728
Now we just work
on your technique.

20:09.063 --> 20:12.132
KONO: I picked it up
in San Miguel last week.

20:12.134 --> 20:13.600
The seller clearly
underestimated

20:13.602 --> 20:15.536
its collectability.

20:15.538 --> 20:17.638
You can tell more about
a painting's provenance

20:17.640 --> 20:20.340
by looking
at its back.

20:20.342 --> 20:22.242
Gallery labels,

20:22.244 --> 20:23.777
the patina
of the frame,

20:23.779 --> 20:26.246
even the nails used
to secure the canvas...

20:26.248 --> 20:27.314
they all tell a story.

20:27.316 --> 20:30.050
And what story
does this tell you?

20:30.052 --> 20:32.252
Unfortunately, that this piece

20:32.254 --> 20:33.954
is a forgery.

20:33.956 --> 20:36.123
Albeit a very good one.

20:38.026 --> 20:38.992
I spent $80,000

20:38.994 --> 20:41.061
of company money
on this piece.

20:41.063 --> 20:43.096
You're telling me
it's worthless?

20:43.098 --> 20:45.499
I'm sorry.

20:45.501 --> 20:47.501
You could go
after the seller,

20:47.503 --> 20:49.770
but I'm guessing
he demanded payment in cash.

20:49.772 --> 20:53.073
If that's the case,
then he's long gone.

20:55.543 --> 20:57.444
My boss is going
to fire me.

20:57.446 --> 20:59.046
If he doesn't
kill me first.

21:00.915 --> 21:04.284
I may have a solution
to your problem.

21:04.286 --> 21:06.587
Please.

21:06.589 --> 21:09.690
I'll do anything.

21:12.193 --> 21:13.927
I could write up an appraisal,

21:13.929 --> 21:15.762
vouching for
the piece's authenticity.

21:15.764 --> 21:18.832
That way, you can
unload it at auction.

21:18.834 --> 21:21.602
And your problem becomes...

21:21.604 --> 21:24.838
well, someone else's problem.

21:24.840 --> 21:26.607
I am so glad

21:26.609 --> 21:28.041
that you said that.

21:28.043 --> 21:29.643
CHIN:
Five-O! Gerard Hirsch,

21:29.645 --> 21:31.245
get your hands
where I can see 'em!

21:31.247 --> 21:32.779
What is this?

21:32.781 --> 21:35.048
Your problem.
And it's a big one.

21:35.050 --> 21:37.684
CHIN: We got you on conspiracy
to commit fraud.

21:37.686 --> 21:40.387
And once the FBI starts
looking into every sale

21:40.389 --> 21:41.822
you've ever touched,
who knows how many more counts

21:41.824 --> 21:43.690
you'll be facing?
The only way to help yourself

21:43.692 --> 21:46.159
now is by helping us.

21:46.161 --> 21:47.227
Meet Tom Emery.

21:47.229 --> 21:48.695
According to Hirsch,

21:48.697 --> 21:51.431
he's one of the biggest buyers
of stolen art in the world.

21:51.433 --> 21:52.633
And he's holding
a private party today

21:52.635 --> 21:53.700
at his Kahala mansion

21:53.702 --> 21:55.035
to show off
his collection.

21:55.037 --> 21:56.470
CHIN: And add to it.
Apparently, this party

21:56.472 --> 21:58.539
is known among insiders
to be <i>the</i> place

21:58.541 --> 22:00.140
to buy and sell
stolen artwork.

22:00.142 --> 22:02.075
A stolen art swap meet?

22:02.077 --> 22:03.877
Seems like a good place
to unload a hot Van Gogh.

22:03.879 --> 22:06.013
Janssen will be there,
guaranteed.

22:06.015 --> 22:08.015
All right, I want us inside that
party when Janssen shows up.

22:08.017 --> 22:09.816
Security's
gonna be tight.

22:09.818 --> 22:11.218
No one's gonna be
allowed in there

22:11.220 --> 22:12.619
without being vetted first.
But thankfully,

22:12.621 --> 22:14.488
Hirsch is on the guest list,
and he's willing to vouch

22:14.490 --> 22:15.923
for Chin and me.
All right, that's good.

22:15.925 --> 22:17.391
Grover and I are gonna lead
the entry team.

22:17.393 --> 22:18.659
As soon as you guys give us word

22:18.661 --> 22:20.294
that Janssen is on site,
we'll move in.

22:20.296 --> 22:21.728
I'll notify SWAT.
(cell phone ringing)

22:21.730 --> 22:22.796
I'll find something to wear.

22:22.798 --> 22:24.197
Hey, Jerry.

22:24.199 --> 22:26.633
Shh. Don't say my name.

22:26.635 --> 22:29.836
Just be cool
and meet me in the hallway.

22:38.713 --> 22:40.681
Jerry, what's this?

22:40.683 --> 22:42.215
When I got home,
I checked my research

22:42.217 --> 22:43.483
and I realized I made a mistake.

22:43.485 --> 22:44.851
A mistake about what?

22:44.853 --> 22:46.253
Bishop & Copley.

22:46.255 --> 22:48.321
The insurance company Nicole
claims to work for.

22:48.345 --> 22:48.756
Mm-hmm.

22:48.757 --> 22:51.291
It turns out they did not
handle the Pordenone case.

22:52.193 --> 22:54.027
Well, then why didn't
she correct you

22:54.029 --> 22:55.596
when you said they did?

22:55.598 --> 22:57.264
Maybe because she's not who

22:57.266 --> 22:59.433
she says she is.

23:03.237 --> 23:05.572
Just hang on a minute,
and I can explain.

23:05.574 --> 23:07.374
What's there to explain?
I know who you are.

23:07.376 --> 23:08.742
You're a bounty hunter
who tracks down

23:08.744 --> 23:10.611
lost and stolen pieces of art
for massive rewards.

23:10.613 --> 23:13.547
And based on the warrants
out for your arrest

23:13.549 --> 23:15.916
in Athens and Budapest,
it's clear you don't

23:15.918 --> 23:18.418
have a problem bending the law.

23:18.420 --> 23:20.754
Look, this isn't just
a payday for me, all right?

23:20.756 --> 23:23.123
I track these pieces down,
and I return them

23:23.125 --> 23:24.825
to their rightful owners.

23:24.827 --> 23:26.893
So what if I have to bend
the rules sometimes?

23:26.895 --> 23:28.795
Hey, Bryan Wallace is
laying in a hospital room

23:28.797 --> 23:30.464
right now fighting
for his life.

23:30.466 --> 23:31.932
And while I've been
out there trying

23:31.934 --> 23:33.634
to catch the guy
who put him there,

23:33.636 --> 23:35.035
you've been lying to me.

23:35.037 --> 23:36.937
The really crazy part is

23:36.939 --> 23:38.238
I still need your help.

23:38.240 --> 23:39.740
There's dozens of
artworks and buyers

23:39.742 --> 23:41.375
who need to be I.D.'d.

23:42.610 --> 23:44.611
See, here's the deal.

23:44.613 --> 23:46.546
We get Janssen.

23:46.548 --> 23:49.149
You get to return the Van Gogh
and collect the reward.

23:49.151 --> 23:51.351
The whole $1.5 million of it.

23:53.821 --> 23:55.288
Girl's got to eat, right?

23:55.290 --> 23:57.391
Yeah, well, flying private
can't be cheap, either.

23:59.093 --> 24:01.395
Look, thank you, really.

24:01.397 --> 24:04.097
I promise I'll be
up front moving forward,

24:04.099 --> 24:06.433
and help any way I can, really.

24:06.435 --> 24:08.435
All right, good.

24:08.437 --> 24:09.970
You're not gonna be
working alone, either.

24:09.972 --> 24:11.471
You should know that.

24:17.745 --> 24:20.047
You mad at me for outing you?

24:20.049 --> 24:22.149
No, I'm just enjoying
the pungent aroma

24:22.151 --> 24:23.417
of those chips you're eating.

24:23.419 --> 24:25.852
Mango habanero.

24:25.854 --> 24:29.156
Got to stay fueled up
on these long stakeouts.

24:29.158 --> 24:31.158
Oh, by the way,

24:31.160 --> 24:32.793
if nature calls,
I got you covered.

24:32.795 --> 24:34.161
GROVER:
Put that away.

24:34.163 --> 24:35.696
That's disgusting.
All right, guys.

24:35.698 --> 24:37.064
All right, heads up.

24:37.066 --> 24:38.832
Our guys just landed.

24:47.108 --> 24:49.309
Thank you.

24:55.450 --> 24:58.518
I ordered some spyglasses off
the back of a comic book once.

24:58.520 --> 25:00.554
Not as cool as these.

25:16.370 --> 25:17.804
Mr. Hirsch?

25:17.806 --> 25:19.406
Mr. Park, Ms. Lin.

25:20.408 --> 25:22.609
Thank you.
Enjoy the event.

25:25.079 --> 25:26.513
GROVER:
Entry team, stand by.

25:26.515 --> 25:27.881
Players on set.

25:28.716 --> 25:30.150
JERRY:
Running facial rec.

25:30.152 --> 25:32.052
Should have a guest list
for you shortly.

25:32.054 --> 25:34.387
STEVE: Chin, you got any sign
of the subject?

25:34.389 --> 25:36.590
Negative.

25:38.793 --> 25:40.694
Guys, none of these paintings

25:40.696 --> 25:42.162
are coming up as stolen.

25:42.164 --> 25:43.830
Something ain't right here.

25:48.803 --> 25:50.904
KONO:
Here comes our host now.

25:50.906 --> 25:52.372
Tom.

25:52.374 --> 25:55.342
This is Mr. Park.

25:55.777 --> 25:58.044
Ms. Lin.

25:58.046 --> 25:59.579
I hear you had quite
the haul today.

25:59.581 --> 26:00.647
Did you bid on the Richter?

26:00.649 --> 26:02.282
Unsuccessfully,
I'm afraid.

26:02.284 --> 26:04.184
Frozen out at $7 million.

26:04.186 --> 26:06.119
There's always that one
that gets away.

26:06.121 --> 26:07.921
I suppose I'll have
to find a way to spend

26:07.923 --> 26:09.189
my money here today.

26:14.095 --> 26:18.265
Well, then, why don't I show you
where we keep the good stuff?

26:28.009 --> 26:30.577
Holy mother lode.

26:31.445 --> 26:32.746
Oh, my God.

26:32.748 --> 26:34.014
Wait. Those paintings
were stolen

26:34.016 --> 26:35.515
from the Himerman in '72.

26:35.517 --> 26:39.553
And that piece is from
the Doscher heist.

26:40.888 --> 26:43.623
I'm told it's human nature
to want what you cannot have.

26:43.625 --> 26:46.459
Thankfully, I wouldn't know.

26:46.461 --> 26:48.061
This is quite the collection.

26:48.063 --> 26:50.130
I'd ask how you
put it together,

26:50.132 --> 26:52.232
but I'm guessing
you'd rather not say.

26:52.234 --> 26:53.800
Discretion is key.

26:53.802 --> 26:55.001
But what's the
point in owning

26:55.003 --> 26:56.837
something so rare and expensive

26:56.839 --> 26:59.206
if you cannot show it off
to your friends?

27:03.878 --> 27:05.545
If you'll excuse me,

27:05.547 --> 27:09.082
I have some business
to attend to.

27:09.084 --> 27:10.650
We got eyes on the subject.

27:10.652 --> 27:12.118
Janssen is here.

27:12.120 --> 27:13.653
All right, move, move!

27:13.655 --> 27:15.889
(sirens whooping)

27:15.891 --> 27:17.357
MAN (over radio):
3902 to CP.

27:17.359 --> 27:18.758
GROVER: All right, entry team,
get ready to roll!

27:18.760 --> 27:20.060
(over radio):
Inner perimeter is set.

27:20.062 --> 27:21.361
Hit team ready.
CP standing by.

27:21.363 --> 27:23.243
We have high ground cover
with our sniper teams.

27:24.732 --> 27:27.601
(quietly): Be advised.
Subject is on the move.

27:27.603 --> 27:30.036
Emery's taking Janssen into the
office. Looks like they're about

27:30.038 --> 27:31.304
to make a deal for the...
(radio chirps)

27:31.306 --> 27:33.173
(feedback echoing)

27:33.175 --> 27:34.307
Chin, say again your last.

27:34.309 --> 27:35.909
Chin?

27:35.911 --> 27:37.944
Kono?
Jerry?

27:37.946 --> 27:40.480
Jerry, we lost Chin and Kono.
What's going on?

27:41.616 --> 27:43.016
I don't know.

27:43.018 --> 27:44.251
But I suddenly

27:44.253 --> 27:45.852
lost cell service.

27:45.854 --> 27:48.054
Yeah, me, too.

27:48.956 --> 27:51.091
Someone's using a signal jammer.

27:51.093 --> 27:52.759
Move!

27:52.761 --> 27:54.494
MAN (over radio): Inner perimeter is set.
Hit team ready.

27:54.496 --> 27:55.862
We are set and ready.

27:55.864 --> 27:58.331
(alarm wailing)

28:09.810 --> 28:11.444
On the floor right now!

28:11.446 --> 28:12.512
Down! Down! On the floor!

28:12.514 --> 28:13.914
On the floor!

28:13.916 --> 28:15.415
Everybody down!

28:15.417 --> 28:16.716
JANSSEN:
If it wasn't already obvious,

28:16.718 --> 28:19.519
this is a robbery.

28:33.731 --> 28:35.500
SWAT's established a perimeter.

28:35.501 --> 28:37.768
Every entry point in the house
is locked down.

28:37.770 --> 28:39.469
Got to be a way to breach.

28:39.471 --> 28:41.371
Not without calling a lot
of attention to yourself,

28:41.373 --> 28:42.639
and that endangers the hostages.

28:42.641 --> 28:44.408
You guys see what's
happening here, right?

28:44.410 --> 28:45.776
Janssen's trading up.

28:45.778 --> 28:47.344
The Van Gogh was just
his way in the door

28:47.346 --> 28:48.712
so that he could boost
Emery's collection.

28:48.714 --> 28:51.214
Yeah, and judging from
the gunfire, he's got at least

28:51.216 --> 28:52.983
four or five
accomplices with him

28:52.985 --> 28:54.217
all armed with
automatic weapons.

28:54.219 --> 28:56.453
I don't get it.
We had eyes on the place.

28:56.455 --> 28:57.455
Every guest was checked

28:57.456 --> 28:58.889
going in.
How did he get

28:58.891 --> 29:00.190
a bunch of guys
in there with guns?

29:00.192 --> 29:01.158
JERRY:
Better question is:

29:01.160 --> 29:02.692
How is he planning
on getting out?

29:02.694 --> 29:04.961
After that alarm went off,
this place became

29:04.963 --> 29:06.396
as impenetrable
as the Dreadfort.

29:06.398 --> 29:08.064
What?

29:08.566 --> 29:10.367
<i>Game of Thrones?</i>

29:10.369 --> 29:11.802
Anyone?

29:11.804 --> 29:13.236
Okay, I don't know
what you're talking about,

29:13.238 --> 29:15.038
but I do know that this
is all by design.

29:15.040 --> 29:17.741
If the alarm went off, it's
because Janssen wanted it to.

29:17.743 --> 29:19.910
And you can be certain
that he's got an exit strategy.

29:19.912 --> 29:22.045
Well, the guy's best card
is the hostages.

29:22.047 --> 29:23.713
Maybe he's gonna play
that to negotiate.

29:23.715 --> 29:26.183
Yeah, and if he finds out
that Chin and Kono are cops,

29:26.185 --> 29:28.051
they're the first ones
he's gonna try to leverage.

29:28.053 --> 29:29.653
NICOLE: I could reach out
to my contacts

29:29.655 --> 29:31.121
at the security companies.

29:31.123 --> 29:32.889
If we can track down
the schematics,

29:32.891 --> 29:35.759
there may be a way that we could
remotely override the alarm.

29:35.761 --> 29:37.527
That's smart.
Okay, thank you, Nicole.

29:37.529 --> 29:40.564
Listen. Even if SWAT could
breach this place right now,

29:40.566 --> 29:42.098
I wouldn't make the call.

29:42.100 --> 29:43.467
Not without knowing
where the hostages were,

29:43.469 --> 29:44.734
how many shooters
we got in there.

29:44.736 --> 29:46.336
We'd just be
going in there blind.

29:46.338 --> 29:48.271
I know, I know,
I know, I know.

29:48.273 --> 29:49.573
Jerry, there's got to be
someway we can

29:49.575 --> 29:50.707
reestablish communication
with Chin and Kono.

29:50.709 --> 29:52.676
Well, theoretically speaking,
I suppose

29:52.678 --> 29:55.378
there is a way
to crash a signal jammer.

29:55.380 --> 29:56.680
Okay.
If I could tap into

29:56.682 --> 29:58.114
the blocking frequency...
Jerry, Jerry, I don't,

29:58.116 --> 29:59.950
I don't care how you do it.
I just need you to do it.

29:59.952 --> 30:02.052
Okay? Can you do it now?
Copy that.

30:02.054 --> 30:04.221
Get in there! Everybody
on the floor. Nobody move.

30:04.223 --> 30:05.956
Be quiet.

30:16.701 --> 30:20.070
JANSSEN: HPD's response time was supposed
to be four minutes,

30:20.072 --> 30:21.805
yet the cops already have
the place surrounded.

30:21.807 --> 30:25.108
MAN: But the only way that's possible
is if they were tipped off

30:25.110 --> 30:26.676
before the alarm
was triggered.

30:26.678 --> 30:29.246
Yeah, find out how.

30:32.717 --> 30:34.284
Holy crap!

30:34.286 --> 30:36.019
I did it!

30:36.021 --> 30:37.487
STEVE: All right, Jerry,
I got the feed up here.

30:37.489 --> 30:39.322
Patch me through to their comms.

30:39.324 --> 30:41.157
JERRY:
You got it.

30:42.026 --> 30:44.561
Please hold for Steve McGarrett.

30:44.563 --> 30:46.263
Go ahead.
STEVE: All right, guys.

30:46.265 --> 30:47.531
Just listen to me
and don't say anything.

30:47.533 --> 30:49.432
We don't want to draw
any attention to ourselves.

30:49.434 --> 30:53.236
Kono, nod if all
the hostages are okay.

30:53.238 --> 30:55.205
Good.
All right, Chin,

30:55.207 --> 30:56.406
I need you to show me
the shooters

30:56.408 --> 30:58.141
and where they're positioned.

31:05.750 --> 31:07.784
All right, stand by, guys.

31:07.786 --> 31:09.886
We've got six threats all armed
with Steyr machine pistols.

31:09.888 --> 31:11.721
Three at the north end
of the room watching

31:11.723 --> 31:13.089
the hostages, the other three
packing up the artwork.

31:13.091 --> 31:15.625
I'll have SWAT ready
as soon as we can make entry.

31:15.627 --> 31:17.827
All right, please tell me
you got the schematics.

31:17.829 --> 31:19.763
I did. There's something here
I need you to see.

31:19.765 --> 31:21.164
This is the office,

31:21.166 --> 31:23.500
which doubles up as
a fortified panic room

31:23.502 --> 31:25.235
when Emery needs to be
holed up inside the house.

31:25.237 --> 31:27.938
But here's where he takes
his paranoia to the next level.

31:27.940 --> 31:29.439
This is a tunnel.

31:29.441 --> 31:30.707
As in an escape tunnel.

31:30.709 --> 31:32.876
Wait a minute.
Janssen was in the office

31:32.878 --> 31:34.210
when the alarm was tripped.

31:34.212 --> 31:36.279
That tunnel is how he and
his boys got into this house.

31:36.281 --> 31:39.849
And that's how he's
gonna take the art out.

31:41.285 --> 31:42.953
We have a problem.

31:42.955 --> 31:44.788
The police took out

31:44.790 --> 31:47.290
our signal jammer.

31:47.292 --> 31:48.558
Collect everyone's phones,

31:48.560 --> 31:50.427
and make sure
they are turned off.

31:50.429 --> 31:51.429
Already done.

31:51.430 --> 31:53.330
I'm still showing a signal.

31:53.332 --> 31:55.932
Only it's radio,
not cellular.

31:56.968 --> 31:59.169
And it's coming from

31:59.171 --> 32:01.371
inside the house.

32:08.346 --> 32:10.614
We've got cops in here.

32:13.184 --> 32:14.985
(static crackling)

32:14.987 --> 32:17.153
All right, this is the mouth

32:17.155 --> 32:18.989
of the tunnel--
it's about 200 yards from here.

32:18.991 --> 32:20.790
This is where we're
gonna be positioned.

32:20.792 --> 32:22.692
All right, once we detain
Janssen and his men

32:22.694 --> 32:24.995
and get them out of there,
then we go back in

32:24.997 --> 32:26.429
and we secure the
hostages-- copy?

32:26.431 --> 32:27.931
JERRY:
Guys?

32:27.933 --> 32:30.033
It's Jerry.

32:30.035 --> 32:31.267
We got a problem.

32:31.269 --> 32:33.503
GROVER:
Jerry, what's in his hand?

32:33.505 --> 32:34.871
JERRY:
Signal finder. He's looking

32:34.873 --> 32:36.840
for an outgoing frequency.

32:36.842 --> 32:39.643
(signal finder chirping)

32:48.219 --> 32:50.420
Yeah, it's them.

32:51.222 --> 32:52.756
You two...

32:52.758 --> 32:55.659
Hand over your earpieces.

33:08.973 --> 33:11.241
I'm still registering
a signal.

33:21.218 --> 33:24.120
If anyone tries coming in here,

33:24.122 --> 33:26.956
your people die first.

33:29.694 --> 33:31.194
(glasses cracking)

33:41.497 --> 33:42.831
(sirens wailing)

33:42.833 --> 33:44.799
GROVER:
All right, HPD

33:44.801 --> 33:46.935
and emergency personnel
are staying put

33:46.937 --> 33:48.670
to help secure the hostages.

33:48.672 --> 33:49.871
All right, nobody
moves until Janssen

33:49.873 --> 33:51.206
and his men are
all in cuffs.

33:51.208 --> 33:53.208
I'm not gonna put Chin and Kono
at any more risk.

33:53.210 --> 33:54.642
All right, gentlemen,

33:54.644 --> 33:56.077
we got six hostiles

33:56.079 --> 33:58.413
about to poke their heads out
and get a nasty surprise.

33:58.415 --> 34:00.949
Any of them tries to engage you,
you light that ass up.

34:01.717 --> 34:03.985
JANSSEN:
Ladies and gentlemen,

34:03.987 --> 34:06.287
I'm afraid this...

34:06.289 --> 34:08.289
is where we say good-bye.

34:10.592 --> 34:12.427
Au revoir.

34:22.737 --> 34:24.472
Everybody, get back from the bag.
KONO: Get back.

34:24.474 --> 34:26.574
Close to the walls.
It's locked.

34:26.576 --> 34:28.909
The gallery
is hermetically sealed.

34:28.911 --> 34:30.844
The doors only open
from outside.

34:34.483 --> 34:35.850
Oh, I know that look.

34:35.851 --> 34:37.452
All right, what's going on?

34:38.821 --> 34:41.755
Janssen's been three steps
ahead of us this whole time.

34:41.757 --> 34:43.891
All right, he eluded TSA.

34:43.893 --> 34:45.627
He made us think
this was about a sale,

34:45.629 --> 34:47.429
when it was actually
about a heist.

34:47.431 --> 34:48.596
He even used the alarm system

34:48.598 --> 34:49.964
to his advantage
by locking us out.

34:49.966 --> 34:52.033
It ain't checkers; it's chess.
I get that,

34:52.034 --> 34:53.831
but what do you think
his next move is gonna be?

34:53.855 --> 34:54.969
I don't know,

34:54.971 --> 34:57.939
but if Janssen can get his hands
on those security schematics,

34:57.941 --> 35:00.809
that man is smart enough
to know that we can, too.

35:02.011 --> 35:04.546
JANSSEN:
If anyone tries coming in ere,

35:04.548 --> 35:08.082
your people die first.

35:08.084 --> 35:10.218
(typing)

35:12.121 --> 35:13.755
Do you want to tell me
what you're doing?

35:13.757 --> 35:14.823
You see that?

35:14.825 --> 35:16.124
See what?

35:17.393 --> 35:19.160
There, check out the shoes.

35:19.162 --> 35:21.629
The shooters are all wearing
patent leather shoes.

35:22.565 --> 35:24.332
Guys,

35:24.334 --> 35:25.867
you better get back here.

35:25.869 --> 35:27.836
For what?

35:27.838 --> 35:29.003
'Cause Janssen's not
coming out that tunnel.

35:29.005 --> 35:30.371
He's going out the front door.

35:32.007 --> 35:34.375
Move out! Move out!
Load up! Load up!

35:49.925 --> 35:52.060
Shut it down.

35:55.231 --> 35:56.431
(buzzer blaring)

35:58.701 --> 36:00.168
MAN (over radio):
Steady. Steady.

36:00.170 --> 36:01.369
Stand fast.

36:01.371 --> 36:02.570
Repeat, stand fast.

36:02.572 --> 36:04.405
(beeping)

36:06.876 --> 36:08.877
Everyone, stay calm.

36:10.579 --> 36:12.347
(hissing)

36:12.349 --> 36:14.182
Close your eyes
and cover your mouth!

36:14.184 --> 36:16.451
(coughing)
And stay low!

36:18.754 --> 36:19.988
(buzzer blares)

36:19.990 --> 36:21.523
Door's open!
KONO: Move toward the door!

36:21.525 --> 36:23.391
Go!
Let's go, let's go!

36:23.393 --> 36:24.559
Go, go!
Come on, let's go!

36:24.561 --> 36:25.994
(coughing continues)

36:25.996 --> 36:29.597
(screaming)

36:33.269 --> 36:35.470
STEVE:
Hold your fire!

36:35.472 --> 36:36.738
Hold your fire!

36:36.740 --> 36:38.039
Paramedics, get in here!

36:38.041 --> 36:40.174
These people need medical attention.
Come on.

36:40.176 --> 36:41.709
All right, come on, folks.

36:41.711 --> 36:43.244
Come on, this way.

36:43.246 --> 36:45.113
Hey, cuff this guy.

36:45.115 --> 36:46.781
And you, keep your nose clean.

36:46.783 --> 36:48.116
Thanks!

36:53.622 --> 36:55.056
Freeze! Drop your weapon!

36:56.292 --> 36:57.625
(crowd screaming)

37:02.431 --> 37:05.099
GROVER:
Steve, cover me!

37:19.648 --> 37:21.282
GROVER:
Lukas Janssen!

37:21.284 --> 37:22.350
Get them up!

37:22.352 --> 37:24.852
Get your hands up.

37:24.854 --> 37:26.854
You're under arrest
for attempted murder,

37:26.856 --> 37:29.390
armed robbery and
a whole bunch of other stuff.

37:29.392 --> 37:30.592
Get up here.

37:30.594 --> 37:31.793
What happened?

37:31.795 --> 37:33.394
"What happened?"

37:33.396 --> 37:35.396
You just caught the bad guy.
That's what happened.

37:35.398 --> 37:36.598
Where's Nicole?

37:36.600 --> 37:38.166
I'm here.

37:38.168 --> 37:40.301
I know I said
I'd help any way I can,

37:40.303 --> 37:42.937
but I'm not suicidal.

37:46.308 --> 37:47.675
You all right?

37:47.677 --> 37:49.544
Huh?

37:49.546 --> 37:51.179
Need an ambulance
or something?

37:51.181 --> 37:52.614
Huh?
Yeah, you know me.

37:52.616 --> 37:54.849
I just got to
walk it off.

38:05.461 --> 38:07.428
Thank you for
keeping your word.

38:07.430 --> 38:09.097
I know you guys
could've easily

38:09.099 --> 38:10.398
returned this yourselves.

38:10.400 --> 38:11.499
Well, if law enforcement

38:11.501 --> 38:13.701
weren't barred
from collecting cash rewards,

38:13.703 --> 38:15.169
you'd be going home
empty-handed right now.

38:15.171 --> 38:16.237
(chuckles)

38:16.239 --> 38:18.272
Well, it was lovely working
with you.

38:18.274 --> 38:20.808
You, too. I'm glad we both
got what we wanted.

38:20.810 --> 38:22.610
Bye.

38:22.612 --> 38:24.812
Bye.

38:25.914 --> 38:27.882
Oh, wait.

38:27.884 --> 38:29.150
I forgot to ask,

38:29.152 --> 38:30.485
how's Bryan Wallace doing?

38:30.487 --> 38:32.453
He's doing okay.

38:32.455 --> 38:35.690
The doctors say he should make
a full recovery.

38:35.692 --> 38:38.059
I'm glad to hear it.

38:38.061 --> 38:40.461
I hope his luck changes soon.

38:40.463 --> 38:42.664
I'll tell him.

38:54.977 --> 38:57.311
(phone rings)

38:57.313 --> 38:58.846
Hello.

38:58.848 --> 39:00.248
Steve, it's Chin.

39:00.250 --> 39:01.883
I just got word from the FBI

39:01.885 --> 39:03.651
that the paintings we recovered
were all fakes.

39:03.653 --> 39:04.886
What?

39:04.888 --> 39:06.287
How's that possible?

39:06.289 --> 39:08.923
Well, according to Tom Emery,
those paintings were all decoys

39:08.925 --> 39:11.592
and the real ones are stored
in a vault inside his house.

39:11.594 --> 39:12.560
Whoa, hold on.

39:12.562 --> 39:14.028
Jerry had
the security schematics.

39:14.030 --> 39:15.730
Why didn't we know
about the vault?

39:15.732 --> 39:17.031
Because Nicole
conveniently omitted

39:17.033 --> 39:18.766
that one page from the file.

39:21.103 --> 39:23.671
Well, there's only one reason
she'd do that.

39:42.758 --> 39:46.360
NICOLE: <i>Like I said,</i>
<i>girl's got to eat, right?</i>

39:46.362 --> 39:47.495
<i>I'll make sure the pieces</i>

39:47.497 --> 39:48.730
<i>get back to</i>
<i>their rightful owners.</i>

39:48.732 --> 39:50.898
<i>As for the Van Gogh,</i>

39:50.900 --> 39:52.600
<i>please see</i>
<i>that the reward goes</i>

39:52.602 --> 39:54.836
<i>to someone deserving.</i>

40:09.818 --> 40:12.120
I don't understand.

40:12.122 --> 40:15.089
What kind of person would just
give us this kind of money?

40:16.325 --> 40:19.227
Somebody who figured
you were due for some good luck.

40:20.963 --> 40:21.929
(Mrs. Wallace gasps)

40:21.931 --> 40:23.464
(chuckles)

40:36.979 --> 40:39.814
(indistinct announcements)

40:41.950 --> 40:43.951
CHIN:
Hey.

40:43.953 --> 40:46.654
I've got to say, Jerry,
you've helped us out before,

40:46.656 --> 40:48.890
but you took it from, like,
a four to an 11 on this one. Thank you.

40:48.892 --> 40:50.625
Yeah, I think
hanging out with Steve is,

40:50.627 --> 40:51.859
uh, having an effect on you.

40:51.861 --> 40:54.629
GROVER: Oh, yeah, driving
head-on into a suspect,

40:54.631 --> 40:55.863
vintage McGarrett.

40:55.865 --> 40:57.131
JERRY:
Now that I have sustained

40:57.133 --> 40:58.566
bodily injury for you guys,

40:58.568 --> 41:00.568
you think I can get that badge?

41:00.570 --> 41:01.969
(laughs)

41:01.971 --> 41:03.271
STEVE: No, but to show
our appreciation,

41:03.273 --> 41:05.339
lunch is on me today.

41:05.341 --> 41:06.407
JERRY:
This isn't lunch.

41:06.409 --> 41:07.775
And besides, it's free.

41:07.777 --> 41:09.497
Right, and as for now,
so are your services.

41:11.013 --> 41:12.647
You brought your own bib?

41:12.649 --> 41:14.715
It's hardly my first rodeo.

41:14.717 --> 41:17.018
Trust me, when the grinds
start coming fast and furious,

41:17.020 --> 41:19.620
you're gonna be wishing
you had one of these babies.

41:19.622 --> 41:20.788
Watch your sauté work.

41:20.790 --> 41:23.624
Don't get sloppy
with the presentation, okay?

41:23.626 --> 41:25.693
SAM CHOY:
Just want to wish you good luck

41:25.695 --> 41:27.995
and say hello
to an old friend here.

41:27.997 --> 41:29.630
Hi, Sam. Good to see you.

41:29.632 --> 41:31.833
So how's the family?
Everything is good?

41:31.835 --> 41:33.501
Yeah, Carol and the boys
are doing great.

41:33.503 --> 41:36.003
We've actually been spending
a lot more time back here

41:36.005 --> 41:37.705
since I opened the new place.

41:37.707 --> 41:38.906
You know,
after I signed the contract,

41:38.908 --> 41:41.709
I heard you were eyeing up
the same spot.

41:42.411 --> 41:43.444
I hope there's

41:43.446 --> 41:44.912
no hard feelings.
Please.

41:44.914 --> 41:46.914
I'm just happy
with your success.

41:46.916 --> 41:48.482
Good to be catching up.

41:48.484 --> 41:50.117
Good luck.
Hey,

41:50.119 --> 41:52.887
can't wait to taste your food.

41:52.889 --> 41:55.223
(laughs)

41:57.359 --> 41:59.493
We must crush him.

42:00.629 --> 42:02.897
I don't think I can do this.

42:02.899 --> 42:04.599
Of course you can.

42:04.601 --> 42:06.667
You are a shrimp samurai.

42:18.647 --> 42:20.915
♪ ♪

42:34.162 --> 42:36.197
All right... yeah!
All right, all right, all right.

42:36.199 --> 42:38.266
That's right! Yeah!

42:47.476 --> 42:49.443
(crowd cheering)

42:54.616 --> 42:56.417
And the winner
of the first annual

42:56.419 --> 42:58.753
Shrimpapalooza cook-off...

43:02.658 --> 43:04.659
Kamekona Tupuola!

43:04.661 --> 43:06.394
(crowd cheering)

43:09.865 --> 43:11.432
Yay!

43:14.937 --> 43:16.904
CHIN: Congratulations.
STEVE: Awesome.

43:18.941 --> 43:20.074
Chef, thank you.
<i>Domo arigato.</i>

43:20.076 --> 43:21.909
I don't know what
you taught him,

43:21.911 --> 43:23.511
but whatever you taught him,
it helped.

43:23.513 --> 43:26.647
MORIMOTO: What helped was
my secret ingredient.

43:26.649 --> 43:28.149
Sansho.

43:28.151 --> 43:30.084
Special Japanese pepper.

43:30.086 --> 43:32.219
Very, very spicy.

43:32.221 --> 43:33.654
I didn't taste
anything spicy at all

43:33.656 --> 43:35.089
in Kamekona's dish.
Of course not.

43:35.091 --> 43:37.892
It was not in his dish.

43:37.894 --> 43:39.560
It was in Choy's dish.

43:41.505 --> 43:43.737
Cooking is combat,

43:44.739 --> 43:46.639
and I don't lose.
