- Morning burgs. Clink, clink.
- Yeah.

00:03.379 --> 00:04.714
- Nothing like being
at a bus stop,

00:04.839 --> 00:06.757
crushing burgs
in the morning with my boys.

00:06.882 --> 00:08.509
- Nothing like it.
- With that said,

00:08.634 --> 00:10.344
uh, when are you going to get
the 'V0 fixed, Ders?

00:10.469 --> 00:12.305
- Dude, when I get $600
to fix the brakes.

00:12.430 --> 00:14.265
- When do you think that's going
to happen for you in your life?

00:14.390 --> 00:15.975
- I don't know.
When I win the lottery'?

00:16.100 --> 00:17.893
- That's, like, a great plan.
My neighbor growing up--

00:18.019 --> 00:20.062
he actually bought
a lotto ticket every day.

00:20.187 --> 00:22.064
He's homeless now.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.899
- Right, 'cause it's next to
impossible to win the lottery.

00:24.025 --> 00:25.276
- It wasn't about the--
the tickets.

00:25.401 --> 00:27.278
He was addicted
to methamphetamines.

00:27.403 --> 00:29.697
- Nice buns.
- They are.

00:29.822 --> 00:31.073
- They're good, right?
- Yeah.

00:31.198 --> 00:32.741
- Excuse you?

00:32.867 --> 00:35.286
- What's up?

00:35.411 --> 00:37.830
- Oh, no. Uh, we were talking
about the burgers.

00:37.955 --> 00:40.458
We were--we were commenting
on how delicious the buns are.

00:40.583 --> 00:42.752
- We can't even see your buns.
- Bitch!

00:42.877 --> 00:44.420
- Hey, leave him alone,
all right?

00:44.545 --> 00:45.755
- Oh, is this your mommy?

00:45.880 --> 00:47.423
- No, if anything,
I'm the daddy,

00:47.548 --> 00:50.676
and I'm asking you to step off.

00:50.801 --> 00:52.845
- And I'm--
I'm a cool bachelor uncle,

00:52.970 --> 00:54.597
and I'm--I'm just, like,
hanging around.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.349
I ride a motorcycle.
I have good hair.

00:56.474 --> 00:58.309

- No, what?

01:01.979 --> 01:03.481
What the--
- Oh, jeez!

01:03.606 --> 01:05.441
- Whoa! Just take--
just take our money, then.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.276

pocket, it's in there.

though--I need that.

01:10.696 --> 01:12.657
- Just give me your soda.
- Yeah, of course.

01:12.782 --> 01:14.742
Uh, I mean, I've already had
too much caffeine anyways.

01:14.867 --> 01:15.951
[chuckles]
- Bitch.

01:16.077 --> 01:17.453
- Hit my limit.
- Oh.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.372

Ooh.

01:19.497 --> 01:22.333
Yeah. So take it.

It's never okay to hit
a chick, right?

She wanted to hit me!
So what am I supposed to do?

My hands are tied, and I'm not
gonna head-butt her either.

02:08.336 --> 02:10.005
- Look, I'm American,
born and bred,

02:10.131 --> 02:12.007
but as a country,
I think it's time we rethink

02:12.133 --> 02:14.093
this whole
never-hit-women policy.

02:14.218 --> 02:15.761

It's Miss B.S.

02:25.146 --> 02:26.605
- Sir, do you recognize me?

02:26.731 --> 02:28.482
Last week you sold me
bogus Jason Mraz tickets.

02:28.607 --> 02:29.900
That's a B.S.!

02:45.332 --> 02:48.043
where last week I went in
with a hidden camera

02:48.169 --> 02:51.881
and got a pretty pricey quote
for a new muffler.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.799
- Oh, yeah, lady,
I can replace that muffler,

02:53.924 --> 02:55.885
but it's going to be,
like, $900.

02:56.010 --> 02:58.220
- So that was the price
for Miss B.S.

02:58.345 --> 03:01.807
Now let's see
what kind of price...

03:03.768 --> 03:06.145
Mr. B.S. gets.

03:06.270 --> 03:08.063
My lady's always trying
to control me.

03:08.189 --> 03:10.357
Last month I had to eat soup
for four nights.

03:10.483 --> 03:13.944
So--so what do we got here,
I mean, just between us?

03:14.069 --> 03:16.655
- Listen, just between us guys--
- Just between us dudes.

03:16.781 --> 03:20.451
- 400 bucks.
- 400 bucks for a new muffler.

03:20.576 --> 03:22.661
- Exactly.
It's a great deal.

03:22.787 --> 03:25.664

08:12.326 --> 08:14.661
- Old people are so stupid.
[laughs]

08:14.787 --> 08:16.205
Oh, cool.

08:16.330 --> 08:17.831
- We should start beating up
old people too...

08:17.956 --> 08:19.083
- Right?

08:19.208 --> 08:20.667
- Just 'cause I hate 'em
so much.

08:20.793 --> 08:22.294
- So tune in Monday

08:22.419 --> 08:24.880
to find out which telemarketing
firm I call B.S. on.

08:25.005 --> 08:29.301
Remember,
you can't B.S. Miss B.S.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.637
- Well, Chuck, what's going on
with the weather?

08:31.762 --> 08:34.472
- I mean, nobody at the office
watches the news, right?

08:34.597 --> 08:35.765
- Nah
I'm sure we're fine.

08:35.890 --> 08:36.892
- Yeah, exactly, so...

08:37.017 --> 08:39.477
- Well, well, well...

08:39.602 --> 08:41.480
if it's not the cast
of Newsroom,

08:41.605 --> 08:44.733
except Jeff Daniels didn't try
to fuck me in my ass.

08:44.858 --> 08:47.694
- You're gonna cost us our jobs,
and I can't lose my job.

08:47.820 --> 08:51.406
This is the only place I feel
comfortable making eye contact.

08:51.532 --> 08:54.868
- [speaking native language]

08:56.662 --> 08:57.663
I pissed now!

08:57.788 --> 08:59.289
- Okay, Yep-

08:59.414 --> 09:01.333
- [spits]
- Whoa!

09:01.458 --> 09:03.335
- Hey, Alice wants to see you
in her office.

09:03.460 --> 09:04.711
Y'all done done it now.

09:04.837 --> 09:07.005
- Ew, what did you eat?

09:07.131 --> 09:08.215
Jeez.
Excuse me.

09:08.340 --> 09:09.800
- Okay, come on,
a little respect.

09:09.925 --> 09:11.426
- Good thing I'm stronger
than most of you.

09:11.552 --> 09:14.721
- Just let me into her office!
She needs to see us!

09:14.847 --> 09:17.724
- Okay, Alice, uh...
[chuckles]

09:17.850 --> 09:19.268
You being a smart lady,

09:19.393 --> 09:21.353
I'm sure you watch the news,
stay informed,

09:21.478 --> 09:23.522
and I just want you to know
that everything we did

09:23.647 --> 09:26.525
was for charity, so it's
a good cause, very positive.

09:26.650 --> 09:29.361
- Also, I would like to press
charges against Waymond

09:29.486 --> 09:30.946
for spitting
in my face just now.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.531
It was very violent.

09:32.656 --> 09:34.616
I don't know what he ate,
but it--it stunk.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.410
Maybe he ate peppercorn.

09:36.535 --> 09:38.579
- After the story airs,
they're closing the branch.

09:38.704 --> 09:40.247
- What--what if we got
on the phones right now,

09:40.372 --> 09:42.624
you know, really took it to 'em
and showed TAC brass

09:42.749 --> 09:44.751
a little hustle and flow?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:44.877 --> 09:46.545
We could throw a little, like,
uh, musical festival outside,

09:46.670 --> 09:48.213
get a baby pool.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.965
- Oh, man,
it's like an '80s movie.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.758
We're just gonna all get
on the phones--a cool montage.

09:51.884 --> 09:53.260
It's like...

09:53.385 --> 09:54.803
♪ Dun-dun-dun,
take it to the limit ♪

09:54.928 --> 09:56.805
- Just go home, or don't.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.391
It doesn't really matter.
Nothing matters.

09:59.516 --> 10:03.228
We're already unemployed,
marked for death.

10:03.353 --> 10:04.563
- Well, I'm gonna...
- Yeah.

10:04.688 --> 10:06.273
- Yeah.
- Go on some calls.

10:06.398 --> 10:07.566
- We're just gonna
let you do your thing.

10:07.691 --> 10:08.817
- <i>Marked</i> for Death, though--

10:08.942 --> 10:10.569
great Segal movie.
Check it out.

10:10.694 --> 10:12.404
- Okay, that was scary.

10:12.529 --> 10:14.573
I've never seen Alice like that
in my life.

10:14.698 --> 10:16.408
I mean, she looked
like she was gonna kill herself

10:16.533 --> 10:18.452
like the Predator does
in Predator.

10:18.577 --> 10:20.579
- Whoa, spoiler alert.
- What are you talking about?

10:20.704 --> 10:22.539
We've watched
the Predator together.

10:22.664 --> 10:24.374
- Yeah, and then I forgot,
so I could enjoy it again.

10:24.499 --> 10:26.335
- Cheer up, 'cause at least now
we know what the B.S.

10:26.460 --> 10:29.171
in "Miss B.S." stands for--
betrayal slut.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.298
- If Miss B.S. were a mister,

10:31.423 --> 10:32.925
I'd say, "Hey, guess what.

10:33.050 --> 10:37.054
You pull that story,
or I will tune you up!"

10:37.179 --> 10:38.805
But I can't, right?
'Cause she's a chick.

10:38.931 --> 10:40.515
- That doesn't even
make sense, man,

10:40.641 --> 10:42.017
because you wouldn't even be
hitting her

10:42.142 --> 10:44.436
for, like, s-sexist,
gender-based reasons.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.438
- That's exactly right,
'cause if you hit a chick

10:46.563 --> 10:48.857
just 'cause she's a chick,
that's wrong.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.943
But if you hit her
because she's out of pocket...

10:51.068 --> 10:53.487
- Isn't it more sexist
not to hit a woman

10:53.612 --> 10:54.863
because she's a woman?

10:54.988 --> 10:56.907
- What you're saying
is more sexist--

10:57.032 --> 10:59.368
- I'm saying, do you want us
to hold the door for you or not?

10:59.493 --> 11:01.536
- Well, you do.
That's gentlemanly.

11:01.662 --> 11:03.455
- Well, sure, right,
but then if you don't get

11:03.580 --> 11:04.748
through that door,
I'm gonna tag you.

11:04.873 --> 11:06.416
- Yeah.
- You're basically denying

11:06.541 --> 11:08.794
the woman's right to get smashed
in the face with a fist.

11:08.919 --> 11:11.463
- That's her right.
It's your human right.

11:11.588 --> 11:12.756
- I think I got an idea.

11:12.881 --> 11:14.466
You know,
just because three dudes

11:14.591 --> 11:16.176
can't hit a woman, right,

11:16.301 --> 11:17.844
doesn't mean that a woman
can't hit the woman

11:17.970 --> 11:20.847
that the three dudes
won't hit.

11:20.973 --> 11:23.517
- What?
- A lot of numbers.

11:23.642 --> 11:24.810
- I stopped listening.

11:24.935 --> 11:26.270
I got really
into chugging my beer.

11:26.395 --> 11:27.896
- I just--| have a plan.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.564
- So you want me to punk
some white lady for y'all?

11:29.690 --> 11:30.691
- That's right, yep.
- Right.

11:30.816 --> 11:32.192
- And if she gets out of hand,

11:32.317 --> 11:33.860
you have our permission to swing
on that chick,

11:33.986 --> 11:35.821
just stomp a mud-hole
in her crud-hole.

11:35.946 --> 11:38.198
- I mean, technically, all you
got to do is scare her enough

11:38.323 --> 11:39.866
that she doesn't run
the story on us,

11:39.992 --> 11:42.327
but if you get the chance,
sock her in the mouth.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.288
- We'd punch her,
but it's, like, a society thing.

11:44.413 --> 11:45.872
- Right.
- Men can't hit women.

11:45.998 --> 11:47.541
It's like Chris Brown
ruined it for everyone.

11:47.666 --> 11:49.501
- What's in it for me?
- Why don't you go ahead

11:49.626 --> 11:52.087
and consider this Carl's Jr.
gift card

11:52.212 --> 11:54.881
and coupon
a little advance.

11:55.007 --> 11:57.092
- Yeah, we thought you'd like it
'cause you ate our food earlier.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.510
- 15 bucks on there,

11:58.635 --> 11:59.928
so you can get a ton
of different stuff.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.430
The guacamole burger,
I'd recommend.

12:01.555 --> 12:03.890
- Beating up a white bitch
for burgers?

12:04.016 --> 12:05.559
That's the shit I like.

12:05.684 --> 12:07.185

15:27.594 --> 15:29.429
- Cheers. Cheers.
- Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.

15:29.554 --> 15:30.680
- Mm-mm.

15:30.805 --> 15:32.224
- Oh, yeah,
you got to put it back.

15:32.349 --> 15:33.433
- [groans] Oh!
- Oh.

15:33.558 --> 15:35.060
- Ow.
- Are you okay?

15:35.185 --> 15:36.561
- No, he'll be fine.
- It's okay.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.063
- Yeah, let's close the door.

15:38.188 --> 15:39.439
We're not trying to heat
the neighborhood.

15:39.564 --> 15:41.066
<i>_</i> okay-
- Yep.

15:41.191 --> 15:43.568
- [humming] I love your blouse.
- Oh, thank you.

15:43.693 --> 15:44.694
Okay.
- Whoo!

15:44.819 --> 15:46.238
- Cheers.
- Oh!

15:46.363 --> 15:47.656
- To new best friends.
- To new best friends.

15:47.781 --> 15:48.949
- [laughs]
Okay.

15:49.074 --> 15:50.534
- [laughs]
Chug UP-

15:50.659 --> 15:52.744
- I think that calls for a shot.
- That calls for a shot.

15:52.869 --> 15:55.038
- Come on, gal pal.
- Okay.

15:55.163 --> 15:56.665
- Mmm.

15:56.790 --> 15:58.667
- And I think that calls
for another shot.

15:58.792 --> 16:00.752
<i>'</i> Oh!
_ [laughs]

16:00.877 --> 16:04.089
- When Miss B.S. is off
the clock, she's off the chain.

16:04.214 --> 16:07.300
- Yeah, tell me about it, man.
She has the coolest moves too.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.261
Look at her go. They're, like,
Indian-influenced.

16:09.386 --> 16:10.762
- [imitating
Native American chant]

16:10.887 --> 16:12.347
I wouldn't mind, uh,
sleeping with her.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.932
I'm part Cherokee, so...
- Yeah.

16:14.057 --> 16:16.476
- My dad drives a grand one.
- So sick.

16:16.601 --> 16:18.562
- Uh-huh.
[siren wails]

16:18.687 --> 16:19.980
- Cops!

16:20.105 --> 16:21.690
Cops, cops, cops, cops,
cops, cops, cops, cops!

16:21.815 --> 16:23.275
- Time to go.
Cops are here.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.776
- Miss B.S., you probably want
to get out of here

16:24.901 --> 16:25.986
before the cops see you.

16:26.111 --> 16:27.737
- [laughs] What?
- Yeah.

16:27.862 --> 16:30.031
Cops are always just snatching
up celebrities unjustly,

16:30.156 --> 16:31.408
like Mel Gibson.

16:31.533 --> 16:33.076
- Why would I care
if the cops see me?

16:33.201 --> 16:34.911
I mean, what's the big deal,
you know?

16:35.036 --> 16:38.081
We're all just having a few
drinks, enjoying the party.

16:38.206 --> 16:39.666
- Actually,
that is the big deal.

16:39.791 --> 16:42.210
Um, everybody drinking here
is pretty much underage.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.588
- Yep.
- This is good for a Merlot.

16:44.713 --> 16:47.257
- Yeah, the all three of them
combined are probably 30.

16:47.382 --> 16:49.301
- Will you go to prom with me?

16:49.426 --> 16:51.761
- What?
Oh, no.

16:51.886 --> 16:55.056
What--so I'm at, like,
a house party with minors?

16:55.181 --> 16:57.225
Why are there children
at your house?

16:57.350 --> 16:59.102
- Well, they rage.
- Kind of.

16:59.227 --> 17:01.104
- They came with me.
- Oh, so what?

17:01.229 --> 17:02.897
You're just here to get
your ass kicked again?

17:03.023 --> 17:04.316
- I'm gonna cut this--

17:04.441 --> 17:05.525
- Oh, you ladies got
some history, huh?

17:05.650 --> 17:07.068
Check this out.
- What?

17:07.193 --> 17:08.612
- Look at this funny video

17:08.737 --> 17:10.739
of you just grinding up
on a child--that's cool.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.449
- That's disgusting.

17:12.574 --> 17:13.907
- Turned into a man
right before our eyes.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.660
- So here's the deal.

17:15.785 --> 17:17.621
We don't want that to leak,
and that'd be bad news.

17:17.746 --> 17:19.580
I mean,
there's Facebook, Twitter.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.333
Myspace is back again.
[pounding at door]

17:21.458 --> 17:22.916
- No, Myspace is not back.
- Dude, I'm telling you.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.127
It's back, okay?
I got a profile on there now.

17:25.252 --> 17:26.963
The format is sick.

17:27.088 --> 17:28.757
- I hope you're right
because I'd love to bring back

17:28.882 --> 17:32.594
my "Hey, Tom,
I'm not your friend," joke.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.554
[pounding at door]
- Open the door!

17:34.679 --> 17:36.014
It's the police!
- Okay. Oh, my god.

17:36.139 --> 17:37.265
This is happening.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.059
I--you guys,
I could lose my job.

17:39.184 --> 17:40.810
- Oh, that sucks.
It's a terrible feeling.

17:40.935 --> 17:41.936
We know it well.
- Terrible.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.563
- But we're cool, right?

17:43.688 --> 17:45.357
We could probably find a way
to not tell the cops--

17:45.482 --> 17:46.691
like, get rid
of all these videos.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.777
- Okay, I see it.
I see all--

17:48.902 --> 17:51.154
I see what you did
and, you know, cue the applause.

17:51.279 --> 17:52.322
Kudos on that.

17:52.447 --> 17:54.574
All right, here's the deal.

17:54.699 --> 17:57.786
If you guys promise to kill
all this footage of me,

17:57.911 --> 18:02.123
and I-l will not run
the TelAmeriCorp story.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.500
- Yes!
- All right!

18:03.625 --> 18:05.168
- Yes, you got it.
You got it.

18:05.293 --> 18:06.961
- Wait, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:07.087 --> 18:08.630
Wait a second.
How do we know you're not lying?

18:08.755 --> 18:09.964
- Yes.
- [sighs]

18:10.090 --> 18:11.675
- You can't B.S. the B.S.ers.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.301
- She's slippery, isn't she?
- That's us.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.969
- Who is it?
- Rick

18:15.095 --> 18:16.971
- It's Rick.
- Don't run the TAC story.

18:17.097 --> 18:19.808
- It's Rick. It's him.
- Okay, I got the facts wrong.

18:19.933 --> 18:22.394
Just run
the dog-park story again.

18:22.519 --> 18:23.853
Everybody loves that crap.

18:23.978 --> 18:25.814
- Dog-park story.
That's the one.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.816
Where's that dog park too?
'Cause, like, chicks for days.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.317
[pounding at door]
- Open the door!

18:29.442 --> 18:30.610
I'm not gonna ask again!

18:30.735 --> 18:31.986
- Okay, so we'll take it
from here.

18:32.112 --> 18:33.613
You hit the back door,
all right?

18:33.738 --> 18:35.031
We'll call you.
- Don't ever call me!

18:35.156 --> 18:36.825
- Wait!
- Oh, Mike.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.368
- See you later, Mike.

18:38.493 --> 18:40.203
- That's a real bonding moment
we shared.

18:40.328 --> 18:42.205
- Right? It was, like, eye
for an eye, and now let's hug.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.416
- Yeah. Now get in here,
and let's French-kiss.

18:44.541 --> 18:45.834
Let's three-way kiss.
- You want to get <i>loco?</i>

18:45.959 --> 18:47.460
I think she knows
what that means.

18:47.585 --> 18:49.379
- What the fuck
is wrong with you guys?

18:49.504 --> 18:51.214
- [beatboxing]

18:53.591 --> 18:55.844
- [beatboxing]

18:57.512 --> 18:59.931
- Don't shoot. No.
- Did it work?

19:00.056 --> 19:01.933
- We did our best cop voices.

19:02.058 --> 19:04.602
I pretended I was Vic Mackey
from The Shield.

19:04.728 --> 19:05.937
- Is that what that was?
- Mm-hmm.

19:06.062 --> 19:07.731
- Okay.
Either way, it worked, so, nice.

19:07.856 --> 19:09.441
- Thanks, Anders.
It means a lot.

19:09.566 --> 19:11.568
- You're creepy sincere.
- I'm proud of y'all.

19:11.693 --> 19:13.570
You know, normally
y'all be messing stuff up,

19:13.695 --> 19:15.280
but you finally
cleaned up your--

19:15.405 --> 19:17.907
oh, my go--why is my 14-year-old
son in here drinking wine?

19:18.032 --> 19:19.033
- [laughing]
Hey, man.

19:19.159 --> 19:20.160
- Junior!
- Chill.

19:20.285 --> 19:21.661
He's a party animal.

19:21.786 --> 19:23.163
- Yo.
- Hey

19:23.288 --> 19:24.581
- I'm taking all the beers.

19:24.706 --> 19:26.499
Marissa, A.J., let's roll.

19:26.624 --> 19:27.959
- No. No, you're not.
- Nope.

19:28.084 --> 19:30.503
- Not this time, no.
- Yeah.

19:31.963 --> 19:33.840
Just give us our beers.

<i>'</i> [sighs]

19:36.426 --> 19:37.635
- Fine.

19:40.305 --> 19:42.474
You can split one.
- Fine. That's all we wanted.

19:42.599 --> 19:44.976
- Move!
- Yeah, that's fine.

19:45.101 --> 19:46.603
- We're brave, though, right?
- Get out of here.

19:46.728 --> 19:47.979
I wasn't even intimidated
that time,

19:48.104 --> 19:49.189
and my crotch is totally dry.

19:49.314 --> 19:51.399
Hell, yeah!
- Whoo! My man!

19:51.524 --> 19:53.151
- Yeah, real heroes.

19:53.276 --> 19:55.195
So we definitely know
the problem is located

19:55.320 --> 19:56.613
under the hood area.

19:56.738 --> 19:58.364
- Yeah, but the--
- Yes!

You GUYS-

19:59.908 --> 20:01.409
- What's up?
- You guys, we did it.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.786
- What?
Are you helping us or what?

20:02.911 --> 20:04.162
- What's up?
- We beat the odds, man.

20:04.287 --> 20:05.580
We did the next to impossible.

20:05.705 --> 20:08.249
- We won the lotto?
- We won the lotto?

20:08.374 --> 20:09.751

- Oh, my god!

I'm buying a new car!

20:11.753 --> 20:13.004
I'm gonna buy you a car!
- No.

- What do you want?
What do you want?

20:15.089 --> 20:17.008
- I'm gonna cry. I'm gonna cry.
Truck it. I want a motorcycle!

20:17.133 --> 20:18.635
- You're gonna burn your crotch
on a rocket!

20:18.760 --> 20:20.386
- I want to go all...

We, uh--we made it
on Worldstar!

20:29.521 --> 20:31.022

- What?

20:31.147 --> 20:33.733
- We made it on to the website
Worldstar Hip-Hop.

20:33.858 --> 20:35.235
Yeah.
Our video made the page.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.195
- Okay, well,
that's still pretty cool.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.197
You got us all excited.
- Come on, get pumped.

20:39.322 --> 20:41.616

Brutal.

- We got a comment.

20:44.786 --> 20:46.663
What's this?
Ezzybeatz7--

20:46.788 --> 20:49.874
he's saying, "if it weren't
illegal to hit women,

20:49.999 --> 20:51.668
I would box these bitches out!"

20:51.793 --> 20:53.294
- [laughs] Yeah.
- That's cool.

20:53.419 --> 20:56.047
- It's good to know
Mr. Beatz7 is on our side.

- Amen.

21:06.307 --> 21:07.517
not watch The Departed
if it's on?

21:07.642 --> 21:09.394
She's telling me,
"Get outside.

21:09.519 --> 21:12.939
"You didn't finish--you never
finished doing up the coop,

21:13.064 --> 21:15.149

all over the place,"

- I know exactly what you mean.

I got one at home
grinding me all the time.
