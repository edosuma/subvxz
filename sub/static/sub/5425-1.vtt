WEBVTT

02:19.084 --> 02:21.751
- Evening, Mr Elliott.
- Good evening.

02:25.084 --> 02:26.751
Brr.

02:26.792 --> 02:29.167
- Just sign the book, if you will?
- Yes.

02:29.917 --> 02:32.751
- Been keeping you busy, Mr Elliott?
- Oh, just nicely.

02:32.834 --> 02:35.417
Went up to Manchester on Monday,
a poisoner.

02:35.501 --> 02:39.084
Baby-farmer at Holloway this morning.
Very ordinary crimes, both of them.

02:39.126 --> 02:41.501
This one we've got for you tomorrow
is something special.

02:41.584 --> 02:43.334
Yes, very much so.

02:43.417 --> 02:45.626
Even after all my years
in the profession,

02:45.751 --> 02:47.834
I'm quite looking forward to him.

02:47.917 --> 02:49.959
- Well, I must be getting along.
- Good night, Mr Elliott.

02:50.084 --> 02:51.792
- Good night.
- Usual cup of tea at 7:00?

02:51.917 --> 02:52.917
Oh, please.

02:54.084 --> 02:57.834
Even my lamented master,
the great Mr Barry himself

02:57.917 --> 03:00.334
never had the privilege
of hanging a duke.

03:00.417 --> 03:01.626
Yes.

03:01.751 --> 03:05.084
What a finale to a lifetime
in the public service.

03:05.126 --> 03:07.959
- "Finale"?
- Yes, I intend to retire.

03:08.084 --> 03:10.584
After using the silken rope,

03:10.667 --> 03:13.834
never again be content with hemp.

03:13.917 --> 03:16.417
- Quite. Well, here we are.
- Oh, thank you.

03:33.126 --> 03:34.876
How will he approach it?

03:34.917 --> 03:37.542
I should think
as the calmest you've ever known.

03:37.584 --> 03:40.417
Noblesse oblige, doubtless.

03:40.542 --> 03:45.042
A difficult client can make things
most distressing.

03:45.084 --> 03:47.917
Some of them tend
to be very hysterical.

03:47.959 --> 03:49.876
So inconsiderate.

03:49.959 --> 03:53.917
Well, Colonel, considering
the importance of the occasion,

03:53.959 --> 03:56.084
I shall retire early.

03:56.209 --> 04:00.709
The last execution of a duke in
this country was very badly bungled.

04:00.751 --> 04:03.376
That was in the old days of the axe,
of course.

04:03.417 --> 04:04.751
Yes.

04:05.584 --> 04:08.251
Oh, I... I almost forgot.

04:08.376 --> 04:11.376
Um, you must forgive my ignorance

04:11.417 --> 04:14.417
but when we meet in the morning,

04:14.459 --> 04:16.959
what is the correct form of address?

04:17.084 --> 04:19.459
- Your Lordship?
- Your Grace.

04:19.584 --> 04:22.917
"Your Grace"? Oh.

04:22.959 --> 04:24.584
Thank you.

04:26.251 --> 04:27.959
Good morning, Your Grace.

04:29.084 --> 04:30.751
Good morning, Your Grace.

04:43.876 --> 04:46.751
- All right. Sit down.
- Ah, good evening, Colonel. Glass of wine?

04:46.876 --> 04:49.459
Good evening, Your Grace.
Uh, thank you, no.

04:49.584 --> 04:53.626
I, uh, I called to inquire whether
you had any special wishes for breakfast.

04:53.751 --> 04:56.751
Just coffee and a slice of
toast, thank you.

04:56.876 --> 04:58.751
Oh, and perhaps a few grapes.

04:58.876 --> 05:00.751
I hate to disappoint
the newspaper-reading public

05:00.876 --> 05:03.792
but it'll be too early
for the conventional hearty breakfast.

05:03.917 --> 05:05.917
The appointment is at 8:00,
is it not?

05:05.959 --> 05:07.959
At 8:00, uh, yes.

05:08.084 --> 05:11.584
If I may venture to say so,
I am amazed at your calmness.

05:13.584 --> 05:16.209
Dr Johnson was, as always, right,

05:16.251 --> 05:18.251
when he observed,
"Depend upon it, sir.

05:18.292 --> 05:20.792
"When a man knows that he's going
to be hanged in a few hours,

05:20.917 --> 05:23.292
"it concentrates his mind wonderfully."

05:23.792 --> 05:27.417
Yes. Well, if there is nothing further
I can do for you...

05:27.542 --> 05:28.917
Nothing, thank you, Colonel.

05:28.959 --> 05:32.876
We shall have the opportunity of making
our adieus in the morning, I presume.

05:32.917 --> 05:34.917
I regret to say, yes.

05:36.584 --> 05:39.084
- Good night, Your Grace.
- Good night, Colonel.

05:48.126 --> 05:51.917
<i>A brief history of the
events leading thereto</i>

05:52.042 --> 05:54.417
<i>written on the eve of his execution</i>

05:54.542 --> 05:58.417
<i>by Louis D'Ascoyne Mazzini,
10th Duke of Chalfont</i>

05:59.417 --> 06:01.959
<i>who ventures to hope
that it may prove not uninteresting</i>

06:02.084 --> 06:04.917
<i>to those who remain to read it.</i>

06:10.917 --> 06:15.084
My good man, it is not by my choice
that you keep me company.

06:15.126 --> 06:18.917
If you wish to sleep, pray do me
the courtesy of sleeping quietly.

06:22.251 --> 06:25.459
<i>With so little time
remaining to complete my story,</i>

06:25.584 --> 06:28.209
<i>it is difficult to choose
where to begin it.</i>

06:28.251 --> 06:29.792
<i>Perhaps I should begin
at the beginning.</i>

06:31.084 --> 06:36.292
<i>I was a healthy baby, born of an
English mother and Italian father...</i>

06:37.792 --> 06:41.751
<i>...who succumbed to a heart attack
at the moment of first setting eyes on me.</i>

06:41.792 --> 06:45.959
<i>In the circumstances, it will be understood
that I have but slight memory of him.</i>

06:46.084 --> 06:48.542
<i>The little I know comes
from what Mama told me.</i>

07:10.042 --> 07:12.376
Your father was a very handsome man.

08:05.917 --> 08:09.084
<i>Mama was the daughter
of the seventh duke of Chalfont</i>

08:09.209 --> 08:11.084
<i>of Chalfont Castle.</i>

08:12.126 --> 08:14.417
<i>She eloped with her handsome singer</i>

08:14.542 --> 08:18.251
<i>and exchanged the medieval splendours
of Chalfont Castle</i>

08:18.376 --> 08:19.751
<i>for the modern conveniences</i>

08:19.792 --> 08:22.417
<i>of No 73, Balaclava Avenue, SW.</i>

08:31.417 --> 08:35.542
<i>They were poor, but they had
five happy and harmonious years</i>

08:35.583 --> 08:39.251
<i>before my arrival sent Papa off
to join the heavenly choir.</i>

08:45.126 --> 08:48.042
<i>Reduced to even deeper poverty
by my father's death,</i>

08:48.084 --> 08:49.959
<i>Mama swallowed her pride</i>

08:50.084 --> 08:53.709
<i>and made an effort at reconciliation
with her family.</i>

08:53.751 --> 08:56.417
<i>They did not even reply to her letter.</i>

08:57.584 --> 08:59.792
<i>In order to keep us both alive,
she was reduced</i>

08:59.917 --> 09:02.209
<i>to the horrible expedient
of taking in a lodger.</i>

09:04.334 --> 09:07.917
<i>For him, she had to perform
the most menial tasks.</i>

09:08.042 --> 09:12.376
<i>She felt that her family had conspired
to cheat me of my birthright,</i>

09:12.417 --> 09:14.584
<i>and I passed
from infancy to childhood</i>

09:14.709 --> 09:18.001
<i>in an atmosphere
of family history and genealogies.</i>

09:19.209 --> 09:20.917
<i>The dukedom had been bestowed</i>

09:21.042 --> 09:24.501
<i>by Charles II
on Colonel Henry D'Ascoyne</i>

09:25.376 --> 09:28.667
<i>for services rendered to His Majesty
during his exile.</i>

09:29.751 --> 09:32.584
<i>Later, for services rendered
to His Majesty</i>

09:32.709 --> 09:35.667
<i>after his restoration by the Duchess,</i>

09:36.167 --> 09:38.084
<i>the title was granted
the unique privilege</i>

09:38.167 --> 09:40.667
<i>of descending by the female
as well as the male line.</i>

09:42.042 --> 09:43.084
Louis.

09:43.209 --> 09:45.584
<i>It was therefore theoretically possible</i>

09:45.709 --> 09:48.751
<i>that via Mama I might inherit the dukedom.</i>

09:51.417 --> 09:53.417
<i>Mama scraped and saved</i>

09:53.501 --> 09:56.667
<i>and sent me to the best school
she could afford.</i>

09:56.751 --> 09:59.709
<i>One little incident of my school days
occurs to me as amusing</i>

09:59.751 --> 10:01.542
<i>in relation to my present situation.</i>

10:01.584 --> 10:03.251
Lionel Holland.

10:04.417 --> 10:06.209
What is the Sixth Commandment?

10:07.417 --> 10:09.417
Come, come now.

10:10.542 --> 10:11.667
Someone else then.

10:11.751 --> 10:13.917
I know, please, Miss Waterman.

10:14.042 --> 10:16.334
Louis Mazzini. Tell him.

10:18.167 --> 10:20.751
- Thou shalt not kill.
- Quite right, Louis.

10:20.834 --> 10:23.417
<i>The Sixth Commandment is,
"Thou shalt not kill."</i>

10:23.542 --> 10:25.209
<i>No, in those days,</i>

10:25.251 --> 10:28.376
<i>I never had any trouble
with the Sixth Commandment.</i>

10:28.417 --> 10:32.834
<i>As to the Seventh, I was hardly of an age
to concern myself with it.</i>

10:32.917 --> 10:36.042
<i>Although I was old enough
to be in love.</i>

10:36.084 --> 10:39.001
<i>So Sibella enters my story.</i>

10:39.084 --> 10:41.584
<i>Sibella and her brother, Graham,
were my only close friends</i>

10:41.709 --> 10:43.834
<i>and we grew up together.</i>

10:43.917 --> 10:48.417
<i>In their case, Mama relaxed her objection
to my associating with the local children.</i>

10:49.084 --> 10:53.084
<i>At least their father, Dr Halworth,
was a professional man.</i>

10:54.209 --> 10:58.209
Louis, we must think very carefully
about your future.

10:58.751 --> 11:00.584
Well, it should be quite easy
to get a job.

11:00.709 --> 11:03.417
Not a job, dear. A career.

11:05.376 --> 11:08.001
I had hoped for Cambridge for you.

11:08.084 --> 11:10.417
The D'Ascoynes always go to Trinity.

11:10.501 --> 11:13.584
And then, perhaps, the diplomatic.

11:13.709 --> 11:16.834
But I'm afraid it's no use
looking as high as that.

11:17.834 --> 11:20.251
However, when you've
passed your examination

11:20.334 --> 11:23.251
that should equip you for a start
in one of the professions.

11:23.334 --> 11:27.584
People of quite good family go into
the professions nowadays, I understand.

11:28.751 --> 11:31.417
Now, who do we know
who could help us?

11:32.417 --> 11:36.667
We don't really know anyone,
except the family, and they don't know us.

11:36.751 --> 11:39.417
The least we can do
is try once more.

11:41.917 --> 11:44.584
I shall write
to Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne.

11:44.709 --> 11:47.417
He can surely do something
in that bank of his.

11:47.542 --> 11:50.584
Bank, Mama? Is that a profession?

11:50.709 --> 11:53.417
This is a private bank, Louis, dear.

11:53.542 --> 11:56.001
They don't pass money over the counter.

11:56.084 --> 11:57.917
<i>The letter was duly dispatched</i>

11:58.001 --> 12:00.251
<i>and this time we did get an answer.</i>

12:00.376 --> 12:03.584
"Madam, I am instructed
by Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne

12:03.709 --> 12:06.917
"to inform you that he is not aware
of your son's existence

12:07.001 --> 12:10.084
"as a member
of the D'Ascoyne family."

12:10.209 --> 12:12.584
Signed by his secretary.

12:12.709 --> 12:16.251
It's very stupid of him, of them all,
not to admit your existence

12:16.376 --> 12:19.209
when one day you might be
duke of Chalfont.

12:19.251 --> 12:21.251
It's a very big "might", Mama.

12:21.334 --> 12:23.751
There must be at least 12 people
before me

12:23.876 --> 12:26.209
to say nothing of the ones
who haven't been born yet.

12:26.251 --> 12:28.834
Stranger things have happened.

12:28.917 --> 12:31.917
I don't wish to be unchristian,
but in view of their attitude,

12:32.042 --> 12:35.501
I could almost wish those 12 people
should all die tomorrow.

12:36.917 --> 12:38.751
All except one, Mama.

12:38.876 --> 12:42.376
Because you must be duchess
of Chalfont before I'm duke.

12:45.167 --> 12:49.251
It will have to be a job, not a career,
after all, Mama.

12:49.334 --> 12:51.667
I'm afraid so, Louis.

12:51.751 --> 12:54.167
A D'Ascoyne in trade.

12:54.251 --> 12:56.709
<i>Did poor Mama's silly dreaming</i>

12:56.751 --> 13:00.251
<i>plant in my brain some seed
which was afterwards to grow</i>

13:00.376 --> 13:03.834
<i>into the most sensational
criminal endeavour of the century?</i>

13:03.917 --> 13:06.251
<i>If so, I was not conscious of it
at the time</i>

13:06.376 --> 13:08.667
<i>for there were things
of more immediate concern.</i>

13:08.751 --> 13:11.334
<i>Even potential dukes have to eat.</i>

13:11.417 --> 13:14.834
<i>Mr Perkins,
our lodger for nearly 15 years,</i>

13:14.917 --> 13:16.542
<i>did his best to be helpful.</i>

13:16.584 --> 13:19.209
<i>He was employed as shop walker
in a local drapery store</i>

13:19.251 --> 13:21.209
<i>and found employment for me there.</i>

13:21.251 --> 13:23.501
<i>The possible future duke of Chalfont</i>

13:23.584 --> 13:27.834
<i>became what was known
as a general assistant at the drapery.</i>

13:27.917 --> 13:32.042
<i>This humiliation continued
for two dispiriting years.</i>

13:33.167 --> 13:36.167
<i>And then one day, Mama,
who had broken her glasses</i>

13:36.251 --> 13:38.584
<i>and could not afford
to have them mended,</i>

13:38.667 --> 13:41.584
<i>was knocked down by a tram
near Clapham Junction</i>

13:41.709 --> 13:43.584
<i>and fatally injured.</i>

13:45.584 --> 13:48.251
- Louis.
- Yes, Mama.

13:49.709 --> 13:52.834
I should like to be buried
at Chalfont,

13:53.542 --> 13:55.542
in the family vault.

13:57.251 --> 13:58.709
Yes, Mama.

14:07.917 --> 14:12.417
<i>I wrote to the Duke
informing him of Mama's dying wish.</i>

14:12.501 --> 14:15.584
<i>His reply
was the curtest possible refusal.</i>

14:15.709 --> 14:20.167
<i>Standing by Mama's poor little grave
in that hideous suburban cemetery,</i>

14:20.251 --> 14:24.709
<i>I made an oath that I would revenge
the wrongs her family had done her.</i>

14:26.084 --> 14:29.376
<i>It was no more than
a piece of youthful bravado</i>

14:29.417 --> 14:34.167
<i>but it was one of those acorns
from which great oaks are destined to grow.</i>

14:34.251 --> 14:36.876
<i>Even then I went so far
as to examine the family tree</i>

14:36.917 --> 14:39.709
<i>and prune it
to just the living members.</i>

14:39.751 --> 14:42.417
<i>But what could I do to hurt them?</i>

14:42.501 --> 14:44.792
<i>What could I take from them,</i>

14:44.876 --> 14:48.417
<i>except, perhaps, their lives?</i>

14:48.501 --> 14:51.209
<i>I indulged for a moment
in a fantasy of all 12 of them</i>

14:51.292 --> 14:54.042
<i>being wiped out simultaneously
at a family reunion</i>

14:54.126 --> 14:55.834
<i>by my unseen hand.</i>

14:55.917 --> 15:00.709
<i>Of the penniless boy from Clapham being
miraculously transplanted to his birthright.</i>

15:00.792 --> 15:03.542
<i>I even speculated
as to how I might contrive it.</i>

15:05.126 --> 15:07.084
<i>But there were
other more urgent problems.</i>

15:07.167 --> 15:10.917
<i>Mama's tiny income came from an annuity
and had died with her.</i>

15:12.417 --> 15:16.751
<i>The problem of how to live
on 25 shillings a week was solved for me</i>

15:16.834 --> 15:20.001
<i>by an invitation from Dr Halworth
to lodge with them.</i>

15:20.084 --> 15:23.834
<i>It was galling to accept the status
of a poor relation</i>

15:23.917 --> 15:27.959
<i>but the certainty of seeing Sibella
every day was too tempting to be refused.</i>

15:28.792 --> 15:32.292
Louis, I'm so glad you accepted.

15:32.376 --> 15:34.334
It was my idea, you know.

15:35.417 --> 15:37.917
- I've brought you something.
- Oh, Louis, you shouldn't have.

15:38.001 --> 15:40.376
You can't possibly afford it.

15:43.001 --> 15:45.376
Oh, what a bother. There's Lionel.

15:45.792 --> 15:47.751
See you at supper.

15:58.251 --> 16:01.834
<i>The next few years
brought many such heartbreaks,</i>

16:01.917 --> 16:03.834
<i>but they also brought promotion.</i>

16:03.917 --> 16:06.626
<i>Laces and ribbons
at 30 shillings a week,</i>

16:06.709 --> 16:09.251
<i>fabrics at 32 and six.</i>

16:09.334 --> 16:12.251
<i>Finally, ladies' underwear at 35.</i>

16:23.417 --> 16:25.876
<i>I decided that
if I was to be a draper,</i>

16:25.959 --> 16:29.292
<i>at least I would not be
a suburban draper.</i>

16:29.376 --> 16:33.376
<i>So I migrated to a large modern store which
had just been opened in the West End,</i>

16:33.459 --> 16:36.584
<i>at the gigantic salary of Â£2 a week.</i>

16:38.542 --> 16:41.917
<i>Every lunchtime I went to see
how my inheritance was proceeding.</i>

16:42.001 --> 16:44.959
<i>Sometimes the deaths column
brought good news.</i>

16:53.751 --> 16:56.917
<i>Sometimes,
the births column brought bad.</i>

16:58.626 --> 17:02.251
<i>The advent of twin sons to the Duke
was a terrible blow.</i>

17:04.916 --> 17:07.209
<i>Fortunately, an epidemic of diphtheria</i>

17:07.291 --> 17:10.291
<i>restored the status quo almost immediately</i>

17:10.376 --> 17:13.666
<i>and even brought me a bonus
in the shape of the Duchess.</i>

17:14.876 --> 17:17.541
<i>That summer, the Halworths gave a party.</i>

17:25.334 --> 17:27.916
- Good evening, Sibella.
- Hello, Louis.

17:29.001 --> 17:31.834
- You do look nice.
- So do you.

17:31.917 --> 17:34.417
- Doesn't he, Lionel?
- Very.

17:43.334 --> 17:45.209
<i>Emboldened by her kindness to me,</i>

17:45.292 --> 17:48.292
<i>I made a decision
I'd been toying with for some time.</i>

17:49.751 --> 17:52.667
Well, that's the last of them,
thank heaven.

17:53.626 --> 17:56.042
- What an evening.
- I thought it was a very nice evening.

17:56.126 --> 17:58.167
It may have been for you. Oh!

17:58.251 --> 18:02.751
It's awful being a woman,
having to dance with a lot of dull men,

18:02.834 --> 18:05.834
laugh at their jokes
while they're treading on your feet.

18:05.917 --> 18:08.834
- I didn't tread on your feet.
- You're not dull.

18:08.917 --> 18:11.501
- And your jokes are funny.
- Thank you.

18:12.709 --> 18:14.959
- Sibella?
- Mmm-hmm?

18:15.042 --> 18:17.792
Sibella, will you marry me?

18:20.001 --> 18:22.709
Louis, of course not. Do get up.

18:22.792 --> 18:24.792
You may be half Italian,
but even so,

18:24.876 --> 18:27.417
you do look silly
playing the stage lover like that.

18:27.501 --> 18:29.959
- Oh, I look silly, do I?
- Yes. Very.

18:37.126 --> 18:39.084
Do I still look silly?

18:45.751 --> 18:47.834
Now, will you marry me?

18:48.667 --> 18:50.209
No.

18:50.876 --> 18:53.917
- Why not?
- Because I just said I'd marry Lionel.

18:56.292 --> 18:58.834
- You can't.
- Why not?

18:58.917 --> 19:01.334
Well, he's a clod.
He's not a gentleman.

19:01.417 --> 19:03.417
Listen to who's talking.

19:03.501 --> 19:06.751
Whoever heard of a gentleman
blacking the lodger's boots?

19:07.167 --> 19:10.042
That's a wicked thing to say.
Just because Mama was poor.

19:10.292 --> 19:12.334
Lionel will be very rich one day.

19:12.626 --> 19:16.376
- I might be a duke one day.
- Pigs might fly.

19:16.459 --> 19:19.834
No, I might. Really, I might.
You see, Mama was the daughter...

19:19.917 --> 19:21.709
Oh, yes. I know.

19:21.792 --> 19:23.417
Well, when you are a duke,

19:23.501 --> 19:26.292
you just come and show me your crown,
or whatever it's called

19:26.376 --> 19:28.667
and then I'll feel awfully silly,
won't I?

19:28.751 --> 19:29.792
Yes, you will.

19:29.876 --> 19:33.376
Anyhow, I'm going to marry Lionel
and now I'm going to bed.

19:37.292 --> 19:40.167
You will.

19:42.876 --> 19:44.459
<i>If there was a precise moment</i>

19:44.542 --> 19:47.626
<i>at which my insubstantial dreaming
took on solid purpose</i>

19:47.709 --> 19:49.584
<i>that was it.</i>

19:49.667 --> 19:52.584
<i>The D'Ascoynes had not only
wronged my mother,</i>

19:52.667 --> 19:56.167
<i>they were the obstacle between me
and all that I wanted.</i>

19:57.334 --> 20:01.042
<i>The more I thought of them,
these people whom I had studied</i>

20:01.126 --> 20:04.751
<i>until I knew their names and histories
as well as I knew my own,</i>

20:04.834 --> 20:07.959
<i>the more they became monsters
of arrogance and cruelty</i>

20:08.042 --> 20:12.126
<i>whose only function in the world
was to deprive me of my birthright.</i>

20:14.876 --> 20:18.251
<i>I had seen Chalfont
only as Mama had painted it.</i>

20:22.876 --> 20:25.709
<i>To pass in through
that magnificent gateway,</i>

20:25.792 --> 20:30.501
<i>on Visitors Day at a cost of sixpence
was a humiliating experience,</i>

20:30.584 --> 20:33.042
<i>but I forced myself to undergo it.</i>

20:33.126 --> 20:37.209
<i>I wanted a closer view of the target
at which I had determined to aim.</i>

20:40.834 --> 20:44.126
<i>I little expected to catch
a glimpse of the bull's-eye.</i>

20:48.501 --> 20:49.917
Excuse me, sir.

20:50.626 --> 20:53.792
<i>There were then some eight people
between me and the dukedom</i>

20:53.876 --> 20:56.292
<i>all seemingly equally out of reach.</i>

20:56.376 --> 20:58.834
<i>It is so difficult to make a neat job
of killing people</i>

20:58.917 --> 21:01.751
<i>with whom one is not
on friendly terms.</i>

21:02.167 --> 21:05.292
<i>I was almost resigned
to its being an impossibility</i>

21:05.376 --> 21:09.167
<i>when one afternoon, at a moment when
my thoughts were furthest from the subject,</i>

21:09.251 --> 21:11.292
<i>fate took a hand.</i>

21:11.376 --> 21:14.334
If you've nothing better,
those will have to do.

21:14.792 --> 21:17.209
These London shops
are so far behind Paris.

21:17.292 --> 21:19.584
Parcel them up quickly,
and we'll take them with us.

21:19.667 --> 21:22.501
- Charge them to my account.
- Yes, sir. What is the name?

21:23.292 --> 21:25.334
Mr Ascoyne D'Ascoyne.

21:27.084 --> 21:30.251
<i>At last, I was face to
face with one of them.</i>

21:30.334 --> 21:33.626
<i>This was the son
of Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne, the banker,</i>

21:33.709 --> 21:36.667
<i>whose refusal to help me
towards a more dignified career</i>

21:36.751 --> 21:39.459
<i>had led to my present
ignominious occupation.</i>

21:40.376 --> 21:42.167
<i>What right had this arrogant puppy</i>

21:42.251 --> 21:45.959
<i>to be standing on the other side
of the counter ordering me about?</i>

21:46.042 --> 21:49.167
<i>In my excitement and anger,
I listened openly to their conversation.</i>

21:49.251 --> 21:52.042
I've booked rooms
at Cruickshanks' at Maidenhead.

21:52.126 --> 21:53.917
We'll go down late
on Friday afternoon.

21:54.001 --> 21:55.667
Are you sure it's safe?

21:55.751 --> 21:59.126
It's the most discreet place.
In fact, anonymous.

22:00.376 --> 22:03.834
Hey, you. Get on with that parcel,
and never mind what we're talking about.

22:03.917 --> 22:06.292
Don't you dare touch me like that!

22:06.376 --> 22:09.251
I'm not interested
in your idiotic conversation.

22:09.334 --> 22:12.792
If you want to add impertinence
to your eavesdropping,

22:13.542 --> 22:15.709
we'll soon see about that.

22:17.459 --> 22:20.834
<i>The upshot was
that I was dismissed on the spot.</i>

22:20.917 --> 22:23.459
<i>I decided to repay him in kind</i>

22:23.542 --> 22:27.459
<i>by dismissing him with equal
suddenness from this world.</i>

22:27.542 --> 22:31.709
<i>His conversation had told me where I could
probably find the opportunity to kill him.</i>

22:31.792 --> 22:35.334
<i>Dr Halworth's dispensary
had provided me with a means.</i>

22:37.626 --> 22:40.501
<i>With the week's wages
I had received in lieu of notice,</i>

22:40.584 --> 22:43.959
<i>I invested in suitable apparel
for a weekend at Maidenhead.</i>

22:53.751 --> 22:56.417
<i>It was possible
they might remember me</i>

22:56.501 --> 22:58.126
<i>but I thought it unlikely,</i>

22:58.209 --> 23:01.459
<i>shop assistants being commonly
regarded as an inferior race</i>

23:01.542 --> 23:04.667
<i>who never emerge
from the other side of the counter.</i>

23:07.834 --> 23:10.751
<i>I decided
to take the bull by the horns.</i>

23:12.209 --> 23:14.876
Forgive me. I wonder if you could
oblige me with a match.

23:14.959 --> 23:16.792
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

23:17.751 --> 23:21.417
- Haven't we met before somewhere?
- I don't think so.

23:22.084 --> 23:25.126
Funny, 'cause I could have sworn
I knew your face.

23:25.209 --> 23:27.417
- Were you at Monte last year?
- The year before.

23:27.501 --> 23:30.209
Ah, that must be it.
Won't you join me?

23:30.292 --> 23:32.459
Thank you. Not this evening.

23:32.542 --> 23:34.459
We are rather tired.

23:40.792 --> 23:43.959
<i>I deprecated their retiring so early,</i>

23:44.042 --> 23:45.959
<i>but it was hard to blame them,</i>

23:46.042 --> 23:48.626
<i>for weekends, like life, are short.</i>

23:49.792 --> 23:52.709
<i>The next morning,
I waited for them to come down</i>

23:52.792 --> 23:54.751
<i>and the next afternoon.</i>

23:57.542 --> 24:00.001
<i>They didn't appear the whole day.</i>

24:05.376 --> 24:06.667
<i>Nor the morning after.</i>

24:23.042 --> 24:24.959
<i>I no longer felt sentimental.</i>

24:25.042 --> 24:27.376
<i>The weekend was nearly over,
and I could hardly expect providence</i>

24:27.459 --> 24:30.917
<i>to offer me
so promising a chance again.</i>

24:31.001 --> 24:32.959
<i>I was in a state of desperation</i>

24:33.042 --> 24:36.251
<i>and I followed them,
hoping for I knew not what.</i>

24:37.376 --> 24:41.417
<i>I had the poison with me, but they
hadn't even taken a picnic basket.</i>

24:41.501 --> 24:45.167
<i>It was possible, however, that they might
stop somewhere for refreshment.</i>

24:48.001 --> 24:50.959
<i>They did stop shortly afterwards,</i>

24:51.042 --> 24:53.001
<i>but not for that.</i>

24:54.209 --> 24:57.667
<i>Judging by past experience,
they would be there for hours.</i>

25:17.959 --> 25:19.792
<i>The rest followed automatically.</i>

25:19.876 --> 25:23.251
<i>I had fortunately learned to swim
at the Clapham Municipal Baths,</i>

25:23.334 --> 25:26.292
<i>though I never had occasion
to try it underwater.</i>

25:27.459 --> 25:30.251
<i>I had no wish to surface
under their noses,</i>

25:30.334 --> 25:33.542
<i>though I doubt if they would have
noticed me even if I had.</i>

25:38.959 --> 25:40.917
<i>It was beautifully timed.</i>

26:15.417 --> 26:17.292
<i>I was sorry about the girl,</i>

26:17.417 --> 26:20.251
<i>but found some relief in the reflection
that she had presumably,</i>

26:20.334 --> 26:23.959
<i>during the weekend, already undergone
a fate worse than death.</i>

26:33.417 --> 26:37.292
<i>I decided to defer consideration
of where and how I should next strike</i>

26:37.417 --> 26:40.251
<i>until my nerves
were thoroughly restored.</i>

26:40.834 --> 26:42.917
<i>It must be remembered
that I was very young</i>

26:43.001 --> 26:46.334
<i>and, furthermore,
I am not naturally callous.</i>

26:48.417 --> 26:50.751
<i>I suddenly conceived a brilliant idea.</i>

26:52.459 --> 26:57.501
<i>I would write a carefully phrased letter
of condolence to old Ascoyne D'Ascoyne.</i>

26:57.584 --> 27:01.751
<i>It would be an agreeable feeling of revenge
for his cruelty to Mama.</i>

27:01.834 --> 27:04.834
<i>And, further, it had not failed to occur
to me that there was, at the moment,</i>

27:04.917 --> 27:07.001
<i>a vacancy in the banking house.</i>

27:08.084 --> 27:10.626
<i>Ascoyne D'Ascoyne duly rose to the bait.</i>

27:12.626 --> 27:15.084
Please be seated, Mr Mazzini.

27:19.417 --> 27:21.417
How do you do?

27:27.084 --> 27:29.001
My late son.

27:33.417 --> 27:34.751
A great loss.

27:35.251 --> 27:36.959
He was young and foolish

27:37.084 --> 27:40.626
but I believe had he been spared
until his maturity...

27:40.751 --> 27:44.417
It was my consciousness of that which led
me to presume to tender you my sympathy.

27:44.459 --> 27:46.584
I am glad that you did so.

27:46.626 --> 27:50.917
A loss so tragic serves to put lesser
matters in their proper perspective.

27:51.959 --> 27:54.459
If I remember rightly, Mr Mazzini,

27:54.584 --> 27:58.917
some years ago
I received a communication

27:58.959 --> 28:00.917
from your mother.

28:01.417 --> 28:02.792
My late mother.

28:10.501 --> 28:13.084
Hello, Louis.
You look very pleased with yourself.

28:13.167 --> 28:15.334
- So do you.
- I have news.

28:15.417 --> 28:16.917
- So have I.
- What is it?

28:16.959 --> 28:18.001
No, yours first.

28:18.084 --> 28:22.084
Lionel and I have fixed a date
for our wedding, in two months' time.

28:22.167 --> 28:23.751
My congratulations.

28:23.834 --> 28:27.001
No, I should congratulate him.
I compliment you.

28:27.084 --> 28:29.917
- Now yours.
- Nothing as exciting as yours.

28:30.917 --> 28:33.501
I went today to see Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne,
my cousin, you know.

28:34.167 --> 28:36.251
He has a private banking house
in the city.

28:36.292 --> 28:38.917
He offered me employment at once
at Â£5 a week

28:39.001 --> 28:41.334
with excellent prospects
for promotion.

28:42.584 --> 28:46.334
Louis, I'm so glad for you.

28:47.959 --> 28:51.584
- Louis, do you remember?
- What?

28:52.084 --> 28:54.501
Once, in this room,

28:55.751 --> 28:57.834
after my party...

28:58.417 --> 29:00.834
- I kissed you.
- Yes.

29:00.917 --> 29:02.792
And you were horrible to me.

29:02.917 --> 29:04.167
Yes.

29:05.084 --> 29:08.667
I made fun about you
being related to the D'Ascoynes.

29:09.917 --> 29:11.834
I'm sorry.

29:11.917 --> 29:13.501
You'll take it more seriously now?

29:13.584 --> 29:15.084
Yes.

29:16.126 --> 29:18.167
Louis, kiss me,

29:19.417 --> 29:21.751
to show you forgive me.

29:25.251 --> 29:28.834
No, it would be wrong.
You're pledged to Lionel.

29:28.917 --> 29:31.751
I behaved like a cad that night.

29:31.792 --> 29:34.751
I like you when you behave
like a cad.

29:41.626 --> 29:44.834
You're a person who must dance
through life, Sibella,

29:44.917 --> 29:47.626
and I hope Lionel won't tread
on your feet too often.

29:52.251 --> 29:54.584
<i>My new employment
was humble enough</i>

29:54.626 --> 29:58.251
<i>but I had to test the rungs of the ladder
before I could climb it.</i>

30:04.667 --> 30:07.626
That's very nice.

30:08.084 --> 30:12.126
<i>The next candidate for removal
seemed to be young Henry D'Ascoyne,</i>

30:12.251 --> 30:14.834
<i>24 years old, recently married,</i>

30:14.917 --> 30:17.084
<i>as yet, without issue.</i>

30:17.167 --> 30:20.126
<i>I had quite an accumulation by now
of D'Ascoyne data</i>

30:20.251 --> 30:22.959
<i>culled from newspapers and periodicals,</i>

30:23.084 --> 30:25.959
<i>and I looked through it
for a possible approach to Henry.</i>

30:26.084 --> 30:27.917
<i>I found one.</i>

30:28.001 --> 30:31.084
<i>I bought the necessary equipment,
second hand,</i>

30:31.126 --> 30:34.001
<i>and bicycled down
the following weekend.</i>

30:34.084 --> 30:37.417
<i>I had studied a couple of photographic
manuals during the week,</i>

30:37.459 --> 30:40.167
<i>and found that, in practice,
the mysteries of the camera</i>

30:40.251 --> 30:42.959
<i>demand a little more
than ordinary intelligence,</i>

30:43.084 --> 30:46.834
<i>plus the ability to judge
a subject upside-down.</i>

30:46.917 --> 30:50.251
<i>It was thus, indeed,
that I first saw Henry D'Ascoyne.</i>

31:05.334 --> 31:08.834
<i>My method of approach proved
an instantaneous success.</i>

31:08.917 --> 31:12.334
Excuse me.
Isn't that a Thornton Pickard?

31:12.417 --> 31:14.626
Yes. Are you a photographer?

31:14.751 --> 31:17.001
Dabble in it. Got a Sanger Shepherd.

31:17.084 --> 31:18.917
- A Sanger Shepherd?
- Nice little camera.

31:19.001 --> 31:21.667
Focal plane shutter,
rapid rectilinear and all that.

31:21.751 --> 31:24.501
Look here. Why not come up
to my house and I'll show it to you?

31:24.584 --> 31:26.751
Well, I'd be most interested.

31:28.126 --> 31:31.417
- My name's D'Ascoyne, by the way.
- Mine is Mazzini.

31:32.167 --> 31:34.626
<i>He seemed a very pleasant fellow</i>

31:34.751 --> 31:37.292
<i>and I regretted that our acquaintanceship
must be so short.</i>

31:38.459 --> 31:41.126
Had one of the potting sheds
fixed up as a darkroom.

31:41.251 --> 31:43.417
Couldn't have suited better
if it had been built for it.

31:43.459 --> 31:45.251
Had the equipment
sent down from town.

31:45.751 --> 31:49.084
And I must say the results
have been absolutely top-hole.

31:49.126 --> 31:53.209
I'll show you some quarter-plates
I've taken about the village.

31:55.084 --> 31:58.417
There we are.
Absolutely lightproof, except for this.

31:58.542 --> 32:03.251
Everything to hand, developing dishes here,
toning bath here, whole-plate enlarger.

32:03.376 --> 32:05.751
- Perfect.
- Not too bad, is it?

32:06.792 --> 32:09.292
Talking of the village, by the by,
I don't know if you're thinking

32:09.417 --> 32:12.209
of sending any of your efforts here
to some periodical,

32:12.251 --> 32:14.251
but there's just one thing.

32:15.709 --> 32:18.209
I'm sure you're a good fellow,
or I wouldn't like to ask.

32:18.251 --> 32:20.251
Ask what?

32:20.292 --> 32:23.917
I'd be most grateful if you'd keep back
that last plate you exposed.

32:24.584 --> 32:27.251
- The inn? But it was delightful.
- Yes.

32:27.876 --> 32:30.917
The fact is, my wife has views
about such places,

32:30.959 --> 32:33.084
so I never go in them,
you understand?

32:33.126 --> 32:35.209
Naturally, I wouldn't dream
of embarrassing you.

32:35.251 --> 32:38.792
I knew you were a good fellow.
Suppose we drink on it?

32:41.084 --> 32:44.251
Unless you have views yourself,
of course.

32:44.292 --> 32:45.917
- None.
- Splendid.

32:46.417 --> 32:49.251
What shall it be?
Sherry? Whisky?

32:52.417 --> 32:54.542
I think a small developer.

32:55.876 --> 32:59.251
<i>The mental picture of his wife
that I had formed from Henry's words</i>

32:59.292 --> 33:03.084
<i>left me unprepared for the charm
of the woman I was to meet.</i>

33:03.126 --> 33:06.584
<i>She was as tall and slender as a lily
and as beautiful.</i>

33:06.626 --> 33:09.459
My dear, this is Mr Mazzini.
He has a Thornton Pickard.

33:09.584 --> 33:11.751
Mr Mazzini, my wife.

33:12.459 --> 33:14.917
I'm no photographer myself,
Mr Mazzini,

33:15.042 --> 33:18.209
but I share my husband's pleasure
in welcoming a fellow enthusiast.

33:18.251 --> 33:21.126
- You'll take some sherry?
- Well, thank you, I...

33:26.751 --> 33:30.292
My husband and I never touch alcohol,
but we see no reason, on that account,

33:30.417 --> 33:32.584
to enforce our views on our guests.

33:32.709 --> 33:34.042
Glass of sherry, Harwood.

33:34.084 --> 33:36.709
I have some printing frames
out in the sun.

33:36.751 --> 33:39.042
If you don't mind,
I'll just run out and see to them.

33:40.751 --> 33:43.251
Have you been in the neighbourhood long,
Mr Mazzini?

33:43.376 --> 33:45.084
A few hours only.

33:45.209 --> 33:47.251
I was cycling through the village

33:47.292 --> 33:49.917
and felt compelled to stop
and make a study or two of the inn.

33:50.042 --> 33:52.917
- It looked so charming.
- It does look charming.

33:53.709 --> 33:55.209
But I'm afraid it's, by no means,

33:55.251 --> 33:57.792
an influence for good
in the lives of our people here.

33:57.917 --> 33:59.584
The landlord
is a former coachman of ours.

33:59.709 --> 34:02.876
I have spoken to him several times about
the amount of drinking that goes on there

34:02.917 --> 34:04.959
but he continues to allow it.

34:05.084 --> 34:07.251
It is, after all, I suppose,
his livelihood.

34:07.292 --> 34:09.417
I do not consider he has the right
to make a livelihood

34:09.542 --> 34:11.876
by exploiting the weaknesses
of his fellow men.

34:13.126 --> 34:15.417
Put as you put it,
it does sound deplorable.

34:15.542 --> 34:18.208
It is deplorable.
Will you excuse me a moment?

34:19.126 --> 34:20.251
Harwood.

34:21.208 --> 34:23.626
<i>I could well understand
Henry's visits to the village inn</i>

34:23.751 --> 34:26.251
<i>and his stock of refreshments
in the darkroom.</i>

34:26.292 --> 34:29.542
<i>Mrs D'Ascoyne was beautiful,
but what a prig she was.</i>

34:30.251 --> 34:33.458
<i>I wondered how
to ingratiate myself with her,</i>

34:33.583 --> 34:36.917
<i>and decided to attack on her own ground
and with her own weapons.</i>

34:36.958 --> 34:40.417
I'm afraid we can offer you
only a simple luncheon, Mr Mazzini.

34:40.458 --> 34:43.792
You are most kind,
but I feel I should not intrude.

34:43.917 --> 34:46.958
- It is no intrusion.
- I'm afraid it is.

34:48.417 --> 34:51.251
- May I explain?
- Please do.

34:54.876 --> 34:57.251
It was only when your husband
told me his name

34:57.376 --> 35:02.417
that I realised that I'd come by chance
into the most embarrassing situation.

35:02.542 --> 35:05.751
My mother was a member
of the D'Ascoyne family.

35:05.876 --> 35:08.751
She married,
as they thought, beneath her.

35:08.792 --> 35:11.376
And from that day,
they refused to recognise her

35:11.417 --> 35:13.584
or my existence.

35:14.251 --> 35:18.959
I feel that, although in the circumstances
you might hesitate to say so to my face,

35:19.084 --> 35:22.917
you and your husband would prefer
not to receive me at your table.

35:23.042 --> 35:26.584
Perhaps you would be good enough
to explain matters to your husband for me.

35:26.626 --> 35:29.417
I shall, naturally,
leave the neighbourhood at once.

35:29.459 --> 35:31.917
Mr Mazzini, please sit down.

35:33.084 --> 35:34.209
Oh.

35:36.459 --> 35:39.251
You have exhibited
the most delicate feelings.

35:39.792 --> 35:42.709
I know nothing of the history
to which you refer,

35:42.751 --> 35:45.584
but I have often felt that the attitude
of my husband's family

35:45.626 --> 35:47.709
has failed to move with the times,

35:47.751 --> 35:50.209
that they think too much
of the rights of nobility

35:50.251 --> 35:52.542
and too little of its duties.

35:52.584 --> 35:57.084
The very honesty of your behaviour
would appear to me to prove them wrong.

35:57.126 --> 36:00.292
Was Lord Tennyson far from the mark
when he wrote,

36:00.417 --> 36:02.751
"Kind hearts are more than coronets

36:02.792 --> 36:05.042
"and simple faith than Norman blood"?

36:06.084 --> 36:07.626
I hope you will stay to luncheon.

36:08.501 --> 36:12.417
Oh, in that case,
I shall be delighted and honoured.

36:12.626 --> 36:15.751
<i>My impersonation of a
man of sterling character</i>

36:15.876 --> 36:17.584
<i>was such a resounding success</i>

36:17.709 --> 36:22.084
<i>that Mrs D'Ascoyne invited me to spend
the following Saturday-to-Monday with them.</i>

36:24.084 --> 36:27.917
<i>When I returned to the somewhat
contrasting atmosphere of Clapham,</i>

36:27.959 --> 36:31.584
<i>I found the house in a whirl with
preparation for Sibella's wedding to Lionel</i>

36:31.709 --> 36:34.042
<i>which was to take place next day.</i>

36:34.084 --> 36:37.126
<i>Before going to bed that evening,
I wandered into the old nursery</i>

36:37.251 --> 36:39.209
<i>to fetch a book I'd left there.</i>

36:48.376 --> 36:50.126
Penny for them.

36:50.251 --> 36:52.417
Oh, hello, Louis.

36:55.459 --> 36:58.251
You're not looking as radiantly happy
as young females in your situation

36:58.376 --> 36:59.417
are supposed to look.

36:59.542 --> 37:02.917
I was just thinking of all the fun
we've had in this room.

37:03.042 --> 37:05.959
- You and I and Graham.
- And Lionel.

37:06.751 --> 37:08.917
Yes, and Lionel.

37:11.584 --> 37:15.417
Oh, Louis,
I don't want to marry Lionel!

37:15.459 --> 37:17.792
- Why not?
- He's so dull!

37:19.376 --> 37:22.376
I must admit he exhibits the most
extraordinary capacity for middle age

37:22.417 --> 37:25.959
that I've ever encountered
in a young man of 24.

37:26.084 --> 37:29.709
However, it's a bit late in the
day to think of that, isn't it?

37:29.751 --> 37:33.084
I know. That only makes it worse.

37:33.126 --> 37:36.084
- I always told you, you should marry me.
- I know.

37:37.459 --> 37:39.917
That makes it worse too.

37:54.417 --> 37:57.584
You look more lovely
today than I've ever seen you.

38:01.042 --> 38:04.251
You're a lucky man, Lionel.
Take my word for it.

38:09.126 --> 38:12.084
<i>I could not help feeling that
even Sibella's capacity for lying</i>

38:12.209 --> 38:14.751
<i>was going to be taxed to the utmost.</i>

38:14.876 --> 38:17.584
<i>Time had brought me revenge on Lionel.</i>

38:18.251 --> 38:20.209
<i>And as the Italian proverb says,</i>

38:20.251 --> 38:24.417
<i>"Revenge is a dish which people of taste
prefer to eat cold."</i>

38:27.584 --> 38:30.251
<i>The following Saturday I left London
in the middle of the night</i>

38:30.376 --> 38:32.417
<i>and reached Henry's house just before dawn.</i>

38:36.959 --> 38:39.376
<i>It took a mere three minutes
to substitute petrol</i>

38:39.417 --> 38:42.209
<i>for the paraffin in the darkroom lamp.</i>

38:42.584 --> 38:45.292
<i>And I then repaired to a meadow
and took a few hours' sleep</i>

38:45.417 --> 38:48.209
<i>while awaiting the hour at which
I could reasonably arrive at the house.</i>

38:50.542 --> 38:53.209
<i>The day dragged by
in an agony of suspense for me.</i>

38:53.626 --> 38:56.584
<i>Henry took photograph
after photograph,</i>

38:56.709 --> 39:00.626
<i>but seemed to have no urge whatever
to follow it up with a visit to the darkroom.</i>

39:04.417 --> 39:05.626
Bravo, Edith!

39:06.042 --> 39:09.959
<i>I began to fear that he had
suddenly taken the pledge.</i>

39:10.959 --> 39:14.584
I think I'll just go and develop these
before tea. Care to come?

39:14.709 --> 39:17.417
I would, indeed, but I have a slight headache.
The sun, I think.

39:17.542 --> 39:19.959
And I'm afraid the chemicals
wouldn't improve it.

39:20.084 --> 39:22.542
Mr Mazzini and I will have tea
under the tulip tree.

39:22.584 --> 39:24.751
I've always found that
most beneficial for a headache.

39:25.251 --> 39:27.792
I'm afraid Henry
will think me a poor enthusiast.

39:27.917 --> 39:31.251
I sometimes think that
he is too great a one.

39:31.292 --> 39:33.209
In a way, I am to blame for it.

39:33.626 --> 39:36.126
Before we were married,
he had few interests.

39:36.251 --> 39:38.209
He used to spend the greater part
of each day at his club.

39:39.917 --> 39:41.251
I felt that such a life was unhealthy

39:41.292 --> 39:44.084
and persuaded him to come
and live here in the country.

39:45.251 --> 39:46.917
I hoped
that perhaps he would interest himself

39:46.959 --> 39:49.917
in the welfare of our tenantry, as I do.

39:50.209 --> 39:52.251
But he became interested in photography
on our honeymoon

39:52.876 --> 39:57.042
and since then it has become
the major preoccupation of his life.

39:58.042 --> 40:00.292
- Mr Mazzini...
- Yes?

40:00.417 --> 40:02.959
I hope you will forgive my speaking to you
on a personal matter,

40:03.626 --> 40:06.209
but it worries me that Henry
should spend so much time on his hobby

40:06.251 --> 40:08.417
that he has little left
for any more useful activity.

40:09.251 --> 40:11.376
Am I right to let him go on like this?

40:11.417 --> 40:14.251
<i>I could hardly point out that
Henry now had no time left</i>

40:14.292 --> 40:16.084
<i>for any kind of activity,</i>

40:16.126 --> 40:18.751
<i>so I continued to discuss his future.</i>

40:18.876 --> 40:20.917
He has never shown any wish
for a career in politics?

40:21.751 --> 40:24.376
- None.
- Nor any other ambitions?

40:24.417 --> 40:27.917
One only. To win a prize
at the Salon Photography in Brussels.

40:29.292 --> 40:30.792
What is it?

40:30.917 --> 40:34.751
Oh, they're just burning some leaves
at the bottom of the garden.

40:34.876 --> 40:37.626
But they can't be at this time of year.

40:39.751 --> 40:41.917
- Henry!
- No. You stay here.

40:42.584 --> 40:44.292
<i>Needless to say, I was too late.</i>

40:46.084 --> 40:49.251
<i>The funeral service was held
in the village church at Chalfont,</i>

40:49.376 --> 40:52.209
<i>prior to interment in the family vault.</i>

40:53.584 --> 40:56.126
<i>Mrs D'Ascoyne, who had discerned in me</i>

40:56.251 --> 40:59.459
<i>a man of delicate sensibility
and high purpose</i>

40:59.584 --> 41:02.417
<i>asked me to accompany her
on the cross-country journey.</i>

41:03.251 --> 41:05.251
"To everything there is a season

41:05.292 --> 41:09.251
"and a time to every purpose
under the heaven.

41:10.126 --> 41:13.751
"A time to be born, and a time to die."

41:14.126 --> 41:16.542
<i>The occasion was interesting,
in that it provided me</i>

41:16.584 --> 41:19.751
<i>with my first sight
of the D'Ascoynes en masse.</i>

41:20.584 --> 41:23.126
<i>Interesting and somewhat depressing,</i>

41:23.251 --> 41:26.417
<i>for it emphasised how
far I had yet to travel.</i>

41:26.876 --> 41:28.709
<i>There was the Duke.</i>

41:32.417 --> 41:35.376
<i>There was my employer,
Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne.</i>

41:37.376 --> 41:40.251
<i>There was Admiral Lord Horatio D'Ascoyne.</i>

41:42.751 --> 41:45.917
<i>There was General Lord
Rufus D'Ascoyne.</i>

41:48.917 --> 41:51.792
<i>There was Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne.</i>

41:55.876 --> 41:59.417
<i>And in the pulpit,
talking interminable nonsense</i>

41:59.542 --> 42:01.626
<i>the Reverend Lord Henry D'Ascoyne.</i>

42:01.751 --> 42:03.542
The life cut short

42:04.292 --> 42:09.084
was one rich in achievement and promise

42:09.542 --> 42:11.959
of service to humanity.

42:12.084 --> 42:14.542
<i>The D'Ascoynes certainly
appeared to have accorded</i>

42:14.584 --> 42:16.751
<i>with the tradition of the landed gentry</i>

42:16.792 --> 42:20.084
<i>and sent the fool of the family
into the church.</i>

42:21.584 --> 42:24.084
Well, goodbye, my dear.

42:24.959 --> 42:27.251
- Goodbye.
- No fretting now.

42:27.292 --> 42:30.417
After all, one thing to be said,
we all have to come to it.

42:31.417 --> 42:35.751
Great thing, you know, family vault like ours.
Constant reminder of one's heritage.

42:35.792 --> 42:37.959
Now, take this new cremation nonsense.

42:38.084 --> 42:41.376
Who wants to see his nearest and dearest
put in an incinerator?

42:41.417 --> 42:44.417
I think, sir, Mrs D'Ascoyne should leave.
The wind is turning cold.

42:44.542 --> 42:46.876
As Mrs D'Ascoyne thinks best.

42:48.459 --> 42:51.126
Glad we had Cousin Henry
to take the service.

42:51.251 --> 42:54.751
Boring old ass,
but it keeps the thing in the family.

42:55.251 --> 42:57.251
People getting strange ideas these days.

42:57.376 --> 42:59.417
Had a fellow write to me not so long ago,

42:59.542 --> 43:02.709
wanted to bury his mother here
from Tooting or somewhere.

43:02.751 --> 43:05.584
Start letting strangers in,
the place will be full up.

43:05.709 --> 43:07.459
No room for us, eh?

43:08.417 --> 43:11.084
<i>I privately promised him that
I would make it my business</i>

43:11.126 --> 43:13.459
<i>to see there was room for him.</i>

43:18.542 --> 43:21.542
Uncle Ethelred is not
the most tactful of men.

43:21.584 --> 43:23.792
I could gladly have struck him.

43:23.917 --> 43:26.709
Thank you for intervening when you did.

43:29.251 --> 43:31.417
The house will be so empty

43:31.917 --> 43:34.584
and yet he will be in it everywhere.

43:35.876 --> 43:38.917
I find the thought of
life there hard to face.

43:38.959 --> 43:41.251
Must you stay there? A new environment...

43:41.917 --> 43:43.459
I must,

43:43.584 --> 43:45.417
for one reason if no other.

43:45.542 --> 43:49.251
They would say I was running away,
that there was truth in all these rumours.

43:49.376 --> 43:52.084
- Rumours?
- In the village.

43:52.876 --> 43:54.709
There's been gossip.

43:55.251 --> 43:58.251
They say that Henry drank in secret.

43:59.917 --> 44:01.876
They even say that
that was the cause of the accident.

44:02.751 --> 44:06.292
I'm sure that Henry would never have
professed one thing and practised another.

44:07.917 --> 44:09.584
I, too, am sure.

44:11.376 --> 44:13.376
Otherwise, I think I could not survive.

44:13.917 --> 44:17.209
We have a long way to go.
Try to sleep a little.

44:18.417 --> 44:19.876
Sleep does not come easily.

44:20.417 --> 44:21.792
Please try.

44:23.042 --> 44:24.376
Allow me.

44:28.251 --> 44:30.042
<i>I was conscious that a new obsession</i>

44:30.084 --> 44:34.251
<i>was about to join the one that I should
wear the coronet of the duke of Chalfont,</i>

44:34.917 --> 44:38.417
<i>that Edith D'Ascoyne should wear that
of the duchess beside me.</i>

44:39.376 --> 44:42.459
<i>Her dignity of bearing
at the worst moments of her grief</i>

44:42.584 --> 44:44.751
<i>had impressed me with the feeling
that here was a woman</i>

44:44.792 --> 44:47.292
<i>whose quality matched her beauty.</i>

44:47.917 --> 44:50.126
<i>I resolved to embark upon her courtship</i>

44:50.251 --> 44:53.917
<i>as soon as a decent period of mourning
should have elapsed.</i>

44:54.251 --> 44:58.584
<i>Sibella? Yes, Sibella was pretty enough
in her suburban way.</i>

44:59.251 --> 45:01.209
<i>And, indeed, there was no reason
why we shouldn't continue</i>

45:01.251 --> 45:03.292
<i>to meet on friendly terms.</i>

45:03.417 --> 45:06.792
<i>But her face would have looked
rather out of place under a coronet.</i>

45:09.751 --> 45:12.751
That, sir, is a list of bills
due for redemption this week.

45:12.876 --> 45:15.209
I've marked in red those
asking for renewal.

45:15.251 --> 45:19.376
Aitcheson, yes.
Pole and Carter, I suppose so.

45:19.417 --> 45:21.709
Knollis Limited, oh, no.

45:21.751 --> 45:23.751
Redbank and Holland...

45:23.792 --> 45:25.917
You have a friend there, have you not?

45:26.042 --> 45:28.626
An acquaintance. I know Lionel Holland.

45:28.751 --> 45:31.084
Would you say that he's sound?

45:31.584 --> 45:32.959
I wouldn't say not, sir.

45:33.084 --> 45:34.709
Hmm. Thank you.

45:40.251 --> 45:42.626
- Mazzini.
- Yes, sir?

45:43.417 --> 45:46.542
I've watched your progress here
with great care

45:46.584 --> 45:49.917
and have been gratified to note
that it has fully justified my judgement

45:49.959 --> 45:52.251
in inviting you into the firm.

45:52.376 --> 45:56.792
In view of that, and in order that
you may be able to adopt a style of living

45:56.917 --> 45:59.751
befitting a member of the D'Ascoyne family,

45:59.876 --> 46:03.209
I have decided
to appoint you my private secretary

46:03.251 --> 46:06.251
at a salary of Â£500 per annum.

46:07.084 --> 46:10.376
- Sir, I cannot begin to...
- Oh, please do not try.

46:10.417 --> 46:14.084
I had intended
that my son should occupy the position.

46:14.917 --> 46:18.876
I can only say that I will try
to make my occupancy of it

46:18.917 --> 46:20.792
worthy of his memory.

46:24.709 --> 46:26.417
<i>I left the Halworths' house</i>

46:26.542 --> 46:29.292
<i>and took a bachelor
apartment in St James's.</i>

46:29.417 --> 46:32.084
<i>Clapham no longer held Sibella's presence
to compensate me</i>

46:32.126 --> 46:34.792
<i>for the tedious journey
between the suburbs and the city.</i>

46:37.084 --> 46:41.459
<i>Anyhow, it would be vastly more convenient
for her to visit me here.</i>

46:54.417 --> 46:57.959
Now, let me have a look
at the beautiful Mrs Holland.

46:58.084 --> 47:01.251
- No, I think I prefer Miss Halworth.
- So do I.

47:02.417 --> 47:05.751
Louis, it's very wrong
of me to visit you here.

47:05.876 --> 47:08.959
- Why?
- A married woman calling on a bachelor?

47:10.292 --> 47:12.126
A dangerous bachelor

47:13.084 --> 47:14.751
in his apartment.

47:14.876 --> 47:16.376
I? Dangerous?

47:19.084 --> 47:21.792
These things only become wrong
when people know about them.

47:21.917 --> 47:24.792
This is a very discreet apartment.
That's why I chose it.

47:24.917 --> 47:28.126
So that young women
could call on you in safety?

47:29.417 --> 47:31.917
So that one young woman could.

47:32.959 --> 47:35.251
How did you know she'd want to?

47:35.376 --> 47:36.626
I hoped.

47:40.542 --> 47:43.542
- How did you enjoy your honeymoon?
- Not at all.

47:45.251 --> 47:46.626
Not at all?

47:47.626 --> 47:49.084
Not at all.

47:51.376 --> 47:53.626
- And how was Italy?
- Oh, impossible!

47:54.126 --> 47:57.376
Every time I wanted to go shopping,
Lionel dragged me off to a church

47:57.417 --> 47:59.209
or picture gallery.

47:59.251 --> 48:02.751
- Said he wanted to improve his mind.
- He has room to do so.

48:03.417 --> 48:07.042
I should reprove you
for saying unkind things about him

48:07.084 --> 48:08.584
but I can't.

48:10.209 --> 48:14.709
Louis, I think I've married
the most boring man in London.

48:14.751 --> 48:16.876
- In England.
- In Europe!

48:20.584 --> 48:24.209
Oh, the Italian men are so handsome,

48:24.751 --> 48:28.251
but I could never get away
from Lionel for a moment.

48:29.542 --> 48:32.251
But I was forgetting, you're Italian.

48:32.709 --> 48:33.876
Half.

48:39.542 --> 48:40.876
Louis...

48:42.126 --> 48:44.917
I can speak frankly to you?

48:46.709 --> 48:48.917
Well, if not to me, to whom?

48:49.751 --> 48:51.376
I shall go mad.

48:51.876 --> 48:54.917
Already when he touches me,
I want to scream.

49:09.751 --> 49:11.417
What am I doing?

49:13.251 --> 49:14.917
You know very well.

49:14.959 --> 49:17.084
You're playing with fire.

49:17.584 --> 49:19.459
At least it warms me.

49:20.959 --> 49:22.376
I must go.

49:24.584 --> 49:26.751
Lionel's dining at home tonight.

49:26.792 --> 49:28.626
Where is Lionel dining tomorrow night?

49:28.751 --> 49:31.251
With some business acquaintances.

49:31.959 --> 49:34.626
And where are you dining tomorrow night?

49:34.751 --> 49:36.251
Here?

49:36.376 --> 49:37.542
Here.

49:44.376 --> 49:46.376
<i>Poor little imprisoned bird.</i>

49:46.417 --> 49:50.417
<i>Well, she was welcome to come
and flutter her wings with me.</i>

49:50.459 --> 49:53.084
<i>I could think of many more
disagreeable ways of killing time</i>

49:53.126 --> 49:55.042
<i>pending the arrival of the moment</i>

49:55.084 --> 49:57.126
<i>when the conventional decencies
would permit me</i>

49:57.251 --> 49:59.626
<i>to make my declaration to Edith.</i>

50:00.626 --> 50:04.251
<i>As to the other undertaking,
I had not forgotten or forgiven</i>

50:04.292 --> 50:06.917
<i>the boredom of the sermon
at young Henry's funeral</i>

50:07.292 --> 50:10.376
<i>and I decided to promote
the Reverend Lord Henry D'Ascoyne</i>

50:10.417 --> 50:11.959
<i>to next place on the list.</i>

50:12.542 --> 50:16.709
<i>I therefore assumed the garb and character
of a colonial bishop</i>

50:16.751 --> 50:21.917
<i>spending his vacation making a collection
of brass rubbings from country churches.</i>

50:24.084 --> 50:26.042
Good evening, my lord.

50:27.251 --> 50:28.751
<i>It was, for a moment,
a shock to be addressed</i>

50:28.792 --> 50:31.917
<i>by my ecclesiastical title,
but I recovered quickly.</i>

50:31.959 --> 50:36.459
Good evening. I was just taking a rubbing
of this most interesting brass.

50:36.751 --> 50:39.792
An ancestress of my dear late wife.

50:40.584 --> 50:43.084
Allow me to introduce myself.

50:43.126 --> 50:47.084
Henry D'Ascoyne, rector of this parish.

50:47.126 --> 50:50.542
Septimus Wilkinson, bishop of Matabeleland.

50:51.959 --> 50:56.542
I was spending my vacation taking a cycling
tour around your beautiful country churches.

50:56.584 --> 51:00.876
- Ah! Have you noticed our clerestory?
- Cle...

51:03.251 --> 51:05.084
Ah, exquisite!

51:05.209 --> 51:07.751
- The corbels are very fine.
- Hmm.

51:08.584 --> 51:12.709
Perhaps Your Lordship would permit me
to show you one or two other things

51:12.751 --> 51:14.417
in which we take a pride.

51:14.459 --> 51:16.584
I should be most interested.

51:16.709 --> 51:19.376
Our most notable features, of course,

51:19.751 --> 51:22.417
are the D'Ascoyne memorials.

51:23.084 --> 51:25.584
Every member of the family

51:26.042 --> 51:29.751
to a cadet branch
of which I have the honour to belong

51:29.876 --> 51:33.584
is buried here in the family vault.

51:35.126 --> 51:39.959
Here you will see
the first duke and his duchess.

51:40.709 --> 51:44.876
The dead watching, as it were,
over the living.

51:46.292 --> 51:49.542
The church is exceptionally endowed also

51:49.584 --> 51:52.959
with items of architectural interest.

51:54.376 --> 51:57.584
You will note that our chantry

51:57.709 --> 52:01.626
displays the crocketed and finialed ogee

52:01.751 --> 52:06.084
which marks it as very early Perpendicular.

52:07.917 --> 52:10.751
The bosses to the pendant are typical.

52:12.626 --> 52:14.584
And I always say

52:15.459 --> 52:18.292
that my west window

52:18.417 --> 52:21.792
has all the exuberance of Chaucer

52:22.751 --> 52:28.251
without, happily, any of
the concomitant crudities of his period.

52:28.292 --> 52:29.584
Hmm.

52:30.084 --> 52:32.251
Now we approach the font.

52:33.251 --> 52:36.376
<i>At last he did as I had hoped
and invited me to dinner.</i>

52:36.417 --> 52:39.959
<i>The Reverend Lord Henry was not
one of those newfangled parsons</i>

52:40.084 --> 52:43.751
<i>who carry the principles of their vocation
uncomfortably into private life.</i>

52:43.792 --> 52:46.376
<i>However, he exhibited a polite interest</i>

52:46.417 --> 52:48.917
<i>in the progress of the Christian faith
in Matabeleland</i>

52:49.042 --> 52:50.917
<i>which I was at some difficulty to satisfy.</i>

52:51.042 --> 52:53.709
The SPCK have provided us

52:53.751 --> 52:56.459
with a large number of copies
of the Good Book

52:56.584 --> 52:58.792
translated into Matabele.

52:58.917 --> 53:02.251
But as none of the natives can read
even their own language...

53:02.292 --> 53:06.251
- You speak Matabele yourself?
- Not as a native.

53:07.251 --> 53:09.626
It would be most interesting

53:09.751 --> 53:12.751
to hear a sample of the language.

53:13.584 --> 53:15.626
I'm afraid my Matabele is a little rusty.

53:15.876 --> 53:18.251
Oh, come, my lord.

53:20.209 --> 53:25.084
Daniel cast into the lions'
den, for example.

53:36.917 --> 53:39.751
It is a colloquial rendering, of course.

53:40.251 --> 53:41.959
Most interesting.

53:44.126 --> 53:46.209
My lord, the port is with you.

53:46.542 --> 53:47.584
Oh.

53:50.917 --> 53:53.917
- How do you find the wine?
- Admirable.

53:54.584 --> 53:57.126
- Courban '69.
- Oh.

53:57.251 --> 53:59.584
No finer year, in my view.

54:02.376 --> 54:06.042
My doctor, though,
is of a different opinion.

54:06.584 --> 54:08.584
And what does he favour?

54:10.251 --> 54:11.792
Abstinence.

54:14.626 --> 54:16.917
Would you care for a cigar?

54:18.126 --> 54:19.584
Thank you.

54:47.084 --> 54:48.251
Yes.

54:50.292 --> 54:55.251
He's continually warning me
about the state of my arteries.

55:00.751 --> 55:02.459
But I say to him,

55:03.417 --> 55:06.584
"What possible harm can there be

55:06.626 --> 55:09.042
"in one glass of an evening

55:11.292 --> 55:12.792
"or even two?"

55:13.251 --> 55:14.959
What harm, indeed.

55:16.917 --> 55:20.251
- You do not condemn me then?
- Not in the least.

55:21.751 --> 55:23.376
If I may say so,

55:24.209 --> 55:27.751
without disrespect to my superiors,

55:28.751 --> 55:32.126
your visit has brought me something

55:32.751 --> 55:37.584
which I could not expect
from any churchman in this country.

56:11.042 --> 56:13.584
<i>I surmised, correctly, as it proved,</i>

56:13.709 --> 56:17.584
<i>that Lord Henry's doctor would assume
that he had succumbed to a surfeit of port</i>

56:17.626 --> 56:20.084
<i>and would politely ascribe death
to a heart attack.</i>

56:20.917 --> 56:23.959
<i>On my return to London,
I decided to proceed methodically</i>

56:24.084 --> 56:27.209
<i>with the elimination of
the remaining minor obstacles.</i>

56:27.251 --> 56:32.084
<i>Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne was a pioneer
in the campaign for women's suffrage.</i>

56:38.417 --> 56:40.917
<i>With the inconvenient consequence
that her public appearances</i>

56:41.042 --> 56:44.917
<i>were invariably made under the watchful
eyes of the metropolitan police.</i>

56:45.042 --> 56:47.292
<i>When she was not making
public appearances,</i>

56:47.417 --> 56:50.584
<i>she was in prison
and still more inaccessible.</i>

56:50.709 --> 56:54.084
<i>In fact, before I could learn
of a favourable opportunity,</i>

56:54.126 --> 56:56.626
<i>I had to join the movement myself.</i>

56:57.126 --> 56:59.376
<i>Secret plans had been made for Lady Agatha</i>

56:59.417 --> 57:01.376
<i>to celebrate her latest
release from Holloway</i>

57:01.417 --> 57:04.459
<i>by a shower of leaflets over Whitehall
and the West End.</i>

57:38.376 --> 57:40.042
<i>I shot an arrow in the air,</i>

57:41.584 --> 57:44.292
<i>she fell to Earth in Berkeley Square.</i>

57:45.459 --> 57:49.209
<i>Admiral Lord Horatio D'Ascoyne
presented a more difficult problem.</i>

57:50.459 --> 57:52.917
<i>He scarcely ever set foot ashore</i>

57:54.126 --> 57:58.626
<i>and I was beginning to feel that this task
was beyond even my ingenuity.</i>

58:01.251 --> 58:04.209
<i>When he was conveniently
involved in a naval disaster</i>

58:04.251 --> 58:07.376
<i>which arose from a combination
of natural obstinacy</i>

58:07.417 --> 58:09.542
<i>and a certain confusion of mind.</i>

58:09.584 --> 58:11.417
<i>Unfortunate in one of his rank.</i>

58:12.709 --> 58:14.417
Bring her to port.

58:17.084 --> 58:20.084
- Surely you mean starboard, sir.
- Port!

58:29.209 --> 58:31.917
<i>Both ships sank almost immediately.</i>

58:31.959 --> 58:35.459
<i>Though, fortunately,
all hands were saved, save one.</i>

58:37.417 --> 58:40.417
<i>Admiral Lord Horatio,
obstinate to the last,</i>

58:40.459 --> 58:43.209
<i>insisted on going down with his ship.</i>

58:46.917 --> 58:50.251
<i>General Lord Rufus D'Ascoyne,
on the other hand,</i>

58:50.292 --> 58:52.626
<i>who never tired of demonstrating
how he had fought</i>

58:52.751 --> 58:55.709
<i>the most calamitous campaign
of the South African War,</i>

58:55.751 --> 58:57.209
<i>was a fairly easy proposition.</i>

58:57.251 --> 59:03.459
At that moment, the concealed enemy
emerged from behind the kopje.

59:04.084 --> 59:08.917
I held our guns' fire until
we could see the whites of their eyes.

59:09.042 --> 59:12.417
Then I gave the order. "Fire!"

59:13.792 --> 59:15.209
Boom, boom, boom.

59:16.459 --> 59:19.417
<i>It seemed appropriate that
he who had lived amidst the cannon's roar</i>

59:19.542 --> 59:21.542
<i>should die explosively.</i>

59:21.917 --> 59:26.917
<i>I therefore concealed in a pot of caviar
a simple but powerful homemade bomb</i>

59:27.626 --> 59:31.376
<i>and through the post,
I sent the caviar to the general.</i>

59:31.626 --> 59:34.292
I pretended to be
deceived by the feint

59:34.417 --> 59:36.626
and sent our horse to meet it.

59:36.751 --> 59:41.709
At that moment, the concealed enemy
emerged from behind the kopje.

59:42.292 --> 59:44.417
I held our guns' fire

59:44.542 --> 59:47.459
till we could see the whites of their eyes.

59:52.959 --> 59:56.292
Used to get a lot of
this stuff in the Crimea.

59:56.417 --> 59:59.251
One thing the Russkies do really well.

01:00:03.292 --> 01:00:05.459
<i>Not an atom of him was left.</i>

01:00:08.792 --> 01:00:13.876
One could almost believe there was a curse
on our unfortunate family, Mazzini.

01:00:13.917 --> 01:00:15.251
Indeed, sir, one could.

01:00:15.376 --> 01:00:18.751
I don't know if you realise
how close this series of tragedies

01:00:18.792 --> 01:00:20.959
has brought you to the succession.

01:00:21.084 --> 01:00:22.792
I had not actually given the matter
any thought, sir.

01:00:22.917 --> 01:00:24.751
Then it's time that you did.

01:00:24.792 --> 01:00:28.626
Do you not realise that you are
heir presumptive to the dukedom?

01:00:28.751 --> 01:00:31.251
That is to say, in the event of
the present duke dying without issue,

01:00:31.376 --> 01:00:34.417
I alone intervene between
you and the title.

01:00:34.876 --> 01:00:36.709
And I am an old man.

01:00:37.459 --> 01:00:40.417
I've never really recovered
from the first of these calamities.

01:00:41.209 --> 01:00:43.251
You mean I might become Duke of Chalfont?

01:00:43.376 --> 01:00:45.292
I mean that you almost certainly will.

01:00:46.751 --> 01:00:48.917
In view of that,
I feel it would be more fitting

01:00:49.042 --> 01:00:52.209
that you should cease to be
an employee here.

01:00:52.251 --> 01:00:55.459
- Oh.
- And become instead my partner.

01:00:56.876 --> 01:00:58.959
I am most deeply grateful and honoured.

01:00:59.084 --> 01:01:03.417
If you'll come round here,
I will make everything very clear to you.

01:01:12.626 --> 01:01:17.626
Uh, had she lived, your mother, of course,
would have succeeded before you.

01:01:18.167 --> 01:01:20.084
<i>One of my first tasks as partner</i>

01:01:20.126 --> 01:01:22.417
<i>was to interview Lionel, who came cap...</i>

01:01:22.959 --> 01:01:25.251
<i>or rather, silk hat in hand.</i>

01:01:26.417 --> 01:01:29.834
To save time, I presume you have called
to ask for renewal of your bill?

01:01:30.917 --> 01:01:33.251
The fact is, old boy, we sold short

01:01:33.334 --> 01:01:36.417
and the market hasn't
dropped as we expected.

01:01:36.501 --> 01:01:40.167
I feel entitled to point out
that we here regard our function

01:01:40.251 --> 01:01:43.251
as the encouragement
of constructive investment

01:01:43.334 --> 01:01:46.251
and not the financing
of mere gambling transactions.

01:01:46.334 --> 01:01:47.584
Now...

01:01:48.626 --> 01:01:50.917
<i>It would have delighted
me to refuse him.</i>

01:01:51.001 --> 01:01:53.667
<i>However, a bankrupt Lionel
could hardly have continued</i>

01:01:53.751 --> 01:01:56.292
<i>to support Sibella in her extravagances</i>

01:01:56.417 --> 01:01:58.751
<i>and I had no wish to do so myself.</i>

01:01:58.792 --> 01:02:03.084
Very well. We will renew
at three and a half percent.

01:02:03.501 --> 01:02:06.167
<i>I judged that the time was now ripe
to make a move</i>

01:02:06.251 --> 01:02:07.917
<i>in the matter of Edith D'Ascoyne.</i>

01:02:07.959 --> 01:02:10.084
It's becoming cold. Shall we go in?

01:02:11.084 --> 01:02:13.584
I know why you shivered just now.

01:02:13.667 --> 01:02:15.917
It was not because you were cold.

01:02:15.959 --> 01:02:17.084
No.

01:02:18.459 --> 01:02:20.501
I couldn't help remembering.

01:02:20.584 --> 01:02:23.459
I know. But do you try to forget?

01:02:24.501 --> 01:02:27.667
- I may sound harsh, but believe me...
- Please.

01:02:28.292 --> 01:02:29.667
Not there.

01:02:32.001 --> 01:02:34.501
Because it was Henry's chair.

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:37.167
It hasn't been used since that day.

01:02:37.667 --> 01:02:39.501
Nothing of his.

01:02:39.584 --> 01:02:43.751
Everything is just as he left it,
his writing desk, his clothes.

01:02:44.459 --> 01:02:47.417
I cannot bear that it should be otherwise.

01:02:49.251 --> 01:02:51.834
You want this house to be a shrine.

01:02:51.917 --> 01:02:55.959
You're wrong.
Shrines are not meant to house the living.

01:02:57.167 --> 01:03:01.667
I have always respected you,
your principles, your courage,

01:03:01.751 --> 01:03:04.167
above any woman I've ever met.

01:03:04.251 --> 01:03:07.584
It is your duty to yourself and to others,

01:03:07.626 --> 01:03:09.459
to Henry even,

01:03:09.584 --> 01:03:12.667
to live again in the
present, in the future.

01:03:13.751 --> 01:03:15.167
What future is there for me?

01:03:22.167 --> 01:03:25.459
I am now going to say
something presumptuous.

01:03:25.584 --> 01:03:28.251
You must order me
from your house if you wish.

01:03:28.334 --> 01:03:29.917
It is this...

01:03:30.626 --> 01:03:34.917
If you should ever feel that
the constant support of a devoted admirer

01:03:34.959 --> 01:03:37.334
would be of assistance to you,

01:03:37.417 --> 01:03:40.584
I should be most honoured
if you would permit me

01:03:40.626 --> 01:03:43.126
to offer you my hand in marriage.

01:03:44.959 --> 01:03:46.417
Mr Mazzini...

01:03:53.626 --> 01:03:55.292
This is a shock.

01:03:57.292 --> 01:03:59.001
I'm most touched.

01:03:59.959 --> 01:04:02.251
Most grateful,

01:04:02.334 --> 01:04:06.251
but I could not consider
even the possibility of remarrying.

01:04:07.292 --> 01:04:10.626
I have spoken too boldly and too soon.

01:04:12.334 --> 01:04:16.292
Please regard what I have said merely
as something to draw upon

01:04:16.417 --> 01:04:18.084
should you ever feel so inclined.

01:04:18.792 --> 01:04:21.417
<i>Sibella was waiting
for me when I got back.</i>

01:04:21.459 --> 01:04:24.417
<i>I was pleased to see her,
for while I never admired Edith</i>

01:04:24.501 --> 01:04:26.584
<i>as much as when I was with Sibella,</i>

01:04:26.626 --> 01:04:29.584
<i>I never longed for Sibella
as much as when I was with Edith.</i>

01:04:31.959 --> 01:04:34.751
I'm afraid I'm late. Have you been bored?

01:04:34.834 --> 01:04:36.001
No.

01:04:36.501 --> 01:04:39.417
I've been looking into
the fire and thinking.

01:04:39.459 --> 01:04:41.501
- What about?
- Oh.

01:04:41.584 --> 01:04:44.959
How we used to roast chestnuts
round the other fire

01:04:45.084 --> 01:04:47.584
and what a lot has happened since.

01:04:47.667 --> 01:04:49.084
Such as?

01:04:49.126 --> 01:04:53.251
How you told me not to marry Lionel
because you might be a duke one day

01:04:53.292 --> 01:04:55.417
and how I laughed at you.

01:04:56.126 --> 01:04:58.251
And how I married Lionel

01:04:58.751 --> 01:05:01.417
and now you very nearly are a duke.

01:05:02.834 --> 01:05:04.667
We're much better off as we are, you and I.

01:05:04.751 --> 01:05:09.417
It's all very well for you to say that.
You're not married to Lionel.

01:05:09.459 --> 01:05:12.167
We see each other when we want to.

01:05:12.251 --> 01:05:14.251
We're not obliged to see each other
when we don't want to.

01:05:14.292 --> 01:05:17.459
We don't see each other
as often as I'd like to.

01:05:17.584 --> 01:05:20.417
- You've been away the whole weekend.
- I had to go.

01:05:20.459 --> 01:05:22.834
- Where?
- To see Mrs D'Ascoyne,

01:05:22.917 --> 01:05:25.667
the widow of that cousin of mine
who was killed.

01:05:25.751 --> 01:05:28.584
All your cousins seem to get killed.

01:05:28.626 --> 01:05:32.792
I really wouldn't be in the least surprised
if you'd murdered them all.

01:05:32.917 --> 01:05:35.126
- Oh.
- How clumsy of me.

01:05:47.251 --> 01:05:50.667
- Whatever made you say that?
- Just silliness.

01:05:51.501 --> 01:05:54.834
Well, if you promise not to tell anyone,
I'll let you in to my guilty secret.

01:05:54.917 --> 01:05:56.251
I did murder them all.

01:05:57.751 --> 01:06:00.292
I've suspected it for a long time.

01:06:01.417 --> 01:06:03.584
- What's she like?
- Who?

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:07.792
- Mrs D'Ascoyne.
- Oh, she's tall, slender...

01:06:08.334 --> 01:06:09.667
Beautiful?

01:06:09.751 --> 01:06:11.667
Yes, I suppose some people
would call her beautiful.

01:06:11.751 --> 01:06:13.251
Would you?

01:06:13.292 --> 01:06:16.626
I suppose so.
I never really thought about that.

01:06:16.751 --> 01:06:19.834
What would you say
if she asked you about me?

01:06:28.501 --> 01:06:32.292
I'd say that you were
a perfect combination of imperfections.

01:06:32.417 --> 01:06:36.001
I'd say that your nose
was just a little too short,

01:06:36.084 --> 01:06:38.584
your mouth just a little too wide,

01:06:39.251 --> 01:06:41.751
but that yours was a face
that a man could see in his dreams

01:06:41.834 --> 01:06:43.959
for the whole of his life.

01:06:44.626 --> 01:06:47.459
I'd say that you were vain, selfish,

01:06:48.334 --> 01:06:50.917
cruel, deceitful.

01:06:52.751 --> 01:06:55.126
I'd say that you were adorable.

01:06:55.917 --> 01:06:58.751
I'd say that you were Sibella.

01:07:00.084 --> 01:07:02.167
What a pretty speech.

01:07:02.251 --> 01:07:03.626
I mean it.

01:07:04.751 --> 01:07:07.001
Come and say it to me again.

01:07:12.126 --> 01:07:14.751
I'd say your nose was
just a little too short,

01:07:14.834 --> 01:07:19.292
and your mouth, yes,
your mouth just a little too wide.

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:29.917
<i>Shortly afterwards,
my employer had a stroke.</i>

01:07:30.417 --> 01:07:32.126
<i>There was little that could be done</i>

01:07:32.251 --> 01:07:35.417
<i>and the doctor gave him a month,
at the most, to live.</i>

01:07:35.459 --> 01:07:38.084
<i>I was glad, after all his kindness to me,</i>

01:07:38.167 --> 01:07:40.626
<i>that I should not have to kill the old man.</i>

01:07:40.751 --> 01:07:44.084
<i>Soon the only obstacle
between me and my inheritance</i>

01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:45.917
<i>would be the Duke himself.</i>

01:07:46.292 --> 01:07:48.584
<i>I could lay no plan for disposing of him</i>

01:07:48.667 --> 01:07:52.584
<i>as the life he led within those great
stone walls was a closed book to me.</i>

01:07:52.626 --> 01:07:55.834
<i>I was gloomily examining the problem
for the hundredth time</i>

01:07:55.917 --> 01:07:59.459
<i>as I awaited one day the expected arrival
of Sibella at my apartments.</i>

01:08:06.917 --> 01:08:10.084
- Good afternoon, Mr Mazzini.
- Mrs D'Ascoyne.

01:08:10.584 --> 01:08:12.001
I was passing through St James's

01:08:12.084 --> 01:08:15.751
and thought I would take the opportunity
to call on you.

01:08:19.084 --> 01:08:20.917
Was that wise? Discreet, I mean?

01:08:21.334 --> 01:08:24.751
There are some conventions which must be
governed by individual circumstance.

01:08:24.792 --> 01:08:27.792
Surely it is safe for a woman
to visit a man of your reputation.

01:08:27.917 --> 01:08:29.751
It is of your reputation that I'm thinking.

01:08:29.834 --> 01:08:33.334
Without being inhospitable, I would be
happier if your visit were not a long one.

01:08:33.417 --> 01:08:36.292
I appreciate the scrupulousness
of your motives.

01:08:36.417 --> 01:08:39.084
I have, anyhow,
only one important matter to speak of.

01:08:39.126 --> 01:08:40.292
That is?

01:08:40.417 --> 01:08:44.084
I have thought a great deal about
what you said at our last meeting

01:08:44.167 --> 01:08:47.792
and I have tried to think
what Henry's wishes would be.

01:08:48.084 --> 01:08:50.417
I remember he said to me once,

01:08:51.126 --> 01:08:54.167
"You have too much good in you, Edith,
for one man.

01:08:54.251 --> 01:08:56.251
"I sometimes wish
that others could have a share of it."

01:08:59.459 --> 01:09:01.667
I have reconsidered the
offer you made to me.

01:09:01.751 --> 01:09:04.417
Thank you again for it,
and accept it gladly.

01:09:05.584 --> 01:09:07.417
You rob me of words.

01:09:08.084 --> 01:09:11.667
I think, however, we should make
no announcement for three months, at least.

01:09:12.126 --> 01:09:13.751
As you think best.

01:09:13.834 --> 01:09:15.751
In these new circumstances

01:09:15.792 --> 01:09:18.584
I think it more than ever desirable
that your unconventional,

01:09:18.667 --> 01:09:21.251
though in its purpose delightful visit
should be cut short.

01:09:21.751 --> 01:09:26.626
If your attention as a husband is equal
of your consideration as a friend,

01:09:26.751 --> 01:09:29.751
I shall have made a
most fortunate decision.

01:09:36.917 --> 01:09:39.167
Do you not think, though,
that perhaps Uncle Ethelred,

01:09:39.251 --> 01:09:42.417
as head of the family,
should be told at once?

01:09:42.917 --> 01:09:45.792
Perhaps so. Yes, I'll write to him.

01:09:45.917 --> 01:09:47.917
Goodbye, Louis.

01:09:48.001 --> 01:09:49.917
Goodbye, Edith.

01:09:51.584 --> 01:09:54.834
You leave behind you
the happiest man in London.

01:10:02.917 --> 01:10:04.292
<i>This was not a piece of news</i>

01:10:04.417 --> 01:10:07.792
<i>which I was looking forward
to breaking to Sibella.</i>

01:10:07.917 --> 01:10:09.751
<i>She had no rights in the matter,</i>

01:10:09.792 --> 01:10:13.417
<i>but women have a disconcerting ability
to make scenes out of nothing</i>

01:10:13.459 --> 01:10:17.417
<i>and to prove themselves injured
when they themselves are at fault.</i>

01:10:19.126 --> 01:10:23.251
<i>Anyhow, I had three months' grace
before I need face that storm.</i>

01:10:34.251 --> 01:10:37.167
Have you taken to using attar of roses?

01:10:37.251 --> 01:10:40.292
- No. Why?
- Thought I could smell it.

01:10:41.501 --> 01:10:45.001
I met such a beautiful woman
on the stairs just now.

01:10:45.917 --> 01:10:47.417
I expect that would be Mrs D'Ascoyne.

01:10:47.501 --> 01:10:49.626
- What was she doing here?
- She called in to see me.

01:10:49.751 --> 01:10:52.626
- What about?
- Business. Family business.

01:10:52.751 --> 01:10:55.251
Let me get you a glass of sherry.

01:10:58.917 --> 01:11:01.917
<i>A day or so later,
I received a letter from Lionel.</i>

01:11:01.959 --> 01:11:06.084
<i>He requested an interview with me
at his house on a matter of some delicacy.</i>

01:11:06.167 --> 01:11:09.292
<i>I was somewhat perturbed,
for nine times out of 10</i>

01:11:09.417 --> 01:11:12.042
<i>what is referred to
as a matter of some delicacy</i>

01:11:12.126 --> 01:11:15.376
<i>is, in point of fact,
one of extreme indelicacy.</i>

01:11:15.667 --> 01:11:19.334
<i>Two days later,
I made the tedious journey to Bayswater.</i>

01:11:20.126 --> 01:11:23.334
<i>It was typical of Lionel that he should
live on the wrong side of the park.</i>

01:11:23.417 --> 01:11:25.709
Hello, old boy. Have a drink.

01:11:26.584 --> 01:11:29.376
No, thank you. Never during the day.

01:11:29.459 --> 01:11:32.709
You don't mind if I do? Keep out the cold.

01:11:33.251 --> 01:11:35.584
I was about to remark
on the warmth of the day.

01:11:35.667 --> 01:11:38.292
- Just a joke, old boy.
- Ah, yes.

01:11:38.876 --> 01:11:42.626
- Sit down, old boy.
- No, thank you. I would rather stand.

01:11:45.001 --> 01:11:48.626
A warm day, isn't it?
For the time of the year, I mean.

01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:52.292
Distinctly. It's also a very busy day.

01:11:52.376 --> 01:11:54.667
May we proceed to the matter
about which you wished to see me?

01:11:54.751 --> 01:11:58.209
Right. A matter of some delicacy,
actually, old boy.

01:12:00.001 --> 01:12:03.251
But I said to myself,
"Louis is a sport and a man of the world.

01:12:03.792 --> 01:12:06.501
- "Always been a sport."
- Thank you.

01:12:06.584 --> 01:12:11.584
Always admired the sporting way in which you
took to Sibella marrying me and not you.

01:12:11.667 --> 01:12:13.709
Some fellows would have
taken it very differently.

01:12:14.584 --> 01:12:16.709
But "May the best man win," you said.

01:12:17.209 --> 01:12:19.667
And when I won,
you behaved like a gentleman.

01:12:19.751 --> 01:12:24.167
So I thought as you being keen on Sibella
at one time

01:12:24.626 --> 01:12:29.084
and you and I are old friends,
I... I'd ask you to help us.

01:12:29.167 --> 01:12:30.334
Help you?

01:12:30.417 --> 01:12:33.167
I told you some time back
business hasn't been going so well.

01:12:34.167 --> 01:12:37.292
Since then, it's gone worse. I'm bankrupt.

01:12:37.959 --> 01:12:42.167
So I say to myself,
"Why not talk to my old pal, Louis Mazzini

01:12:42.959 --> 01:12:47.667
"who we used to have such jolly times with
round the old nursery fire

01:12:48.209 --> 01:12:49.834
"roasting chestnuts."

01:12:49.917 --> 01:12:52.001
I'm afraid your memory is deceiving you.

01:12:52.084 --> 01:12:56.667
By no stretch of imagination could you and
I be described as ever having been "pals".

01:12:56.751 --> 01:12:59.292
If I remember correctly,
we detested each other cordially

01:12:59.376 --> 01:13:00.542
from the first day we met,

01:13:00.626 --> 01:13:03.126
with a detestation
which increased with our years.

01:13:03.209 --> 01:13:06.834
Always thought of you as a pal.
Always have done.

01:13:07.626 --> 01:13:08.917
That's why I said to myself...

01:13:09.001 --> 01:13:11.459
It's only fair to warn you
that any further expense of breath

01:13:11.542 --> 01:13:13.459
on this subject would be a waste.

01:13:14.626 --> 01:13:16.626
You know what you're doing?

01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:19.667
- Condemning me to death.
- What do you mean?

01:13:19.751 --> 01:13:23.292
Only one way out for me,
do away with myself.

01:13:23.792 --> 01:13:26.209
If you knew how absurd
these histrionics sounded...

01:13:26.292 --> 01:13:29.751
I'm insured. At least the little woman
will be provided for.

01:13:29.834 --> 01:13:33.167
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.
- Louis, I appeal to you.

01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:37.459
Not for my sake,
but for the sake of the little woman.

01:13:37.542 --> 01:13:39.876
Please rise from that absurd position.

01:13:55.126 --> 01:13:58.334
All I can say is
I think you're a cad.

01:13:58.876 --> 01:14:00.417
A selfish cad.

01:14:02.667 --> 01:14:05.001
Let me remind you
of a little not-so-ancient history.

01:14:05.751 --> 01:14:08.584
When I was a draper's assistant and you
a rich father's son,

01:14:08.667 --> 01:14:10.251
you showed me no kindness.

01:14:10.334 --> 01:14:14.001
Now our positions are reversed,
and you come whining to me for favours.

01:14:14.084 --> 01:14:16.917
Draper's assistant. That's right.

01:14:17.001 --> 01:14:19.459
Rotten little counterjumper.
That's all you are.

01:14:20.417 --> 01:14:22.792
Very high and mighty now

01:14:22.876 --> 01:14:26.084
but your mother married
an Italian organ-grinder.

01:14:29.042 --> 01:14:30.417
- Stand up.
- Huh?

01:14:30.501 --> 01:14:32.459
I said stand up.

01:14:33.834 --> 01:14:37.292
I will not tolerate hearing
my mother's name on your coarse tongue.

01:14:45.459 --> 01:14:49.042
If you take my advice, you'll go
and put your head under a cold tap.

01:14:49.126 --> 01:14:52.792
I refuse to demean myself
by fighting with a drunken oaf.

01:15:04.876 --> 01:15:07.959
<i>There seemed no point
in prolonging this vulgar brawl</i>

01:15:08.042 --> 01:15:10.167
<i>so I returned to my apartment.</i>

01:15:17.334 --> 01:15:19.751
<i>I took a bath and decided to relax
for half an hour</i>

01:15:19.834 --> 01:15:22.126
<i>and efface this disagreeable scene
from my memory.</i>

01:15:24.542 --> 01:15:26.501
<i>I was not allowed to relax for long.</i>

01:15:32.167 --> 01:15:33.584
Sibella.

01:15:36.751 --> 01:15:40.251
Louis, I'm sorry to worry you
when you must be so busy

01:15:40.334 --> 01:15:42.459
but I have a piece
of important news.

01:15:43.042 --> 01:15:44.167
Bad news.

01:15:44.751 --> 01:15:46.751
I thought you ought
to know it at once.

01:15:54.376 --> 01:15:56.167
Lionel has found out about us.

01:15:57.584 --> 01:15:59.751
About me coming here.

01:15:59.834 --> 01:16:01.542
- Really?
- Yes.

01:16:01.626 --> 01:16:02.667
Oh.

01:16:04.001 --> 01:16:07.626
I had the most dreadful scene
with him last night.

01:16:08.709 --> 01:16:12.376
Well, I suppose even Lionel isn't
stupid enough to be deceived forever.

01:16:12.459 --> 01:16:14.792
You won't take it so calmly
when you hear.

01:16:16.084 --> 01:16:18.334
He's going to start
divorce proceedings.

01:16:18.417 --> 01:16:20.459
How very unsophisticated of him.

01:16:22.209 --> 01:16:26.542
There's only one possible
way out that I can see.

01:16:28.042 --> 01:16:31.542
- And that is?
- Lionel is still in love with me.

01:16:32.376 --> 01:16:34.751
My happiness
is all he cares about.

01:16:35.459 --> 01:16:38.542
He might do the gentlemanly thing
and let me divorce him.

01:16:39.542 --> 01:16:40.626
If?

01:16:42.167 --> 01:16:44.709
If I were in a position to explain to him

01:16:44.792 --> 01:16:47.751
that otherwise he will be jeopardizing
the social position

01:16:47.834 --> 01:16:50.167
not only of the future duke,

01:16:50.251 --> 01:16:52.917
but also the future duchess of Chalfont.

01:16:55.084 --> 01:16:56.292
I see.

01:17:02.917 --> 01:17:06.167
You're a clever little thing, Sibella,
but not quite clever enough.

01:17:06.251 --> 01:17:07.584
What do you mean?

01:17:07.667 --> 01:17:10.209
I mean that not only do I know
that you're blackmailing me,

01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:12.501
an ugly word,
but the only appropriate one,

01:17:12.584 --> 01:17:15.167
but I also know
that you're bluffing me.

01:17:15.251 --> 01:17:17.292
Call my bluff and see.

01:17:17.376 --> 01:17:18.709
I will.

01:17:22.792 --> 01:17:24.501
Let me explain.

01:17:24.584 --> 01:17:27.126
It must have seemed to you
that you hold a very strong hand.

01:17:27.209 --> 01:17:29.584
But... A very important "but",

01:17:29.667 --> 01:17:34.001
it so happens that I hold a card which
you did not even know to be in the pack.

01:17:34.084 --> 01:17:35.376
Who's bluffing now?

01:17:35.459 --> 01:17:38.626
It so happens that I was with Lionel
less than an hour ago.

01:17:38.709 --> 01:17:42.126
And it was transparently clear
from his demeanour and conversation

01:17:42.209 --> 01:17:45.667
that he had not the faintest suspicion
that you and I had any relationship

01:17:45.751 --> 01:17:48.501
other than that of,
as he would probably put it,

01:17:48.959 --> 01:17:53.084
old pals who used to roast chestnuts
together round the jolly old nursery fire.

01:17:55.084 --> 01:17:58.292
So, while thanking you
for the honour that you've done me,

01:17:58.376 --> 01:18:01.209
I must decline your offer
because I have other arrangements

01:18:01.292 --> 01:18:03.084
which make it impossible for me
to accept it.

01:18:03.167 --> 01:18:04.626
Namely?

01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:08.084
I'm shortly going to announce
my engagement to Mrs D'Ascoyne.

01:18:17.001 --> 01:18:20.042
May I say that I think
you've behaved despicably?

01:18:22.584 --> 01:18:27.042
Has it ever occurred to you, Sibella,
that we serve each other right, you and I?

01:18:32.167 --> 01:18:35.959
Would it be asking too much of your manners
to escort me to the door?

01:18:43.376 --> 01:18:46.209
<i>I had suspected that to
confide our secret to the Duke</i>

01:18:46.292 --> 01:18:49.459
<i>might be an adroit manoeuvre,
and I was proved correct,</i>

01:18:49.542 --> 01:18:54.167
<i>for it produced an invitation for Edith
and me to spend a few days at the castle.</i>

01:18:55.251 --> 01:18:59.084
<i>I must confess that I could not suppress
an agreeable sensation of triumph</i>

01:18:59.167 --> 01:19:01.334
<i>as I approached
the castle gateway</i>

01:19:01.417 --> 01:19:04.792
<i>in circumstances so different
from those in which I had last done so.</i>

01:19:05.751 --> 01:19:08.209
<i>It was just an informal
little house party.</i>

01:19:09.209 --> 01:19:13.167
<i>Our fellow guests were Lady Redpole
and her daughter Maud,</i>

01:19:13.251 --> 01:19:16.542
<i>who most suitably resembled
nothing so much as a red poll cow</i>

01:19:16.626 --> 01:19:18.584
<i>and had little more
conversational ability.</i>

01:19:18.667 --> 01:19:21.667
- Did you go to the opera this season?
- No.

01:19:24.917 --> 01:19:28.334
<i>In the afternoon,
Ethelred invited me to inspect the castle.</i>

01:19:28.417 --> 01:19:30.626
<i>It was pleasant to stand
on the battlements</i>

01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:34.001
<i>and know that the acres
which stretched as far as the eye could see</i>

01:19:34.084 --> 01:19:35.917
<i>would soon be mine.</i>

01:19:36.334 --> 01:19:40.376
<i>And it amused me to cover much the same
ground as that of my sixpenny tour.</i>

01:19:41.501 --> 01:19:43.959
<i>I had never been in a building
so lavishly equipped</i>

01:19:44.042 --> 01:19:46.376
<i>with the instruments
of violent death.</i>

01:19:46.459 --> 01:19:48.376
Feel the weight of that.

01:19:48.459 --> 01:19:51.001
Our ancestors must have
been fine men, Louis.

01:19:54.042 --> 01:19:55.959
<i>They seemed, however, ill-adapted</i>

01:19:56.042 --> 01:19:58.959
<i>to the discreet requirements
of 20th-century homicide.</i>

01:20:00.042 --> 01:20:05.167
<i>And the end of the day found my host
still intact and myself still without a plan.</i>

01:20:12.126 --> 01:20:14.417
Beautiful woman, Edith.

01:20:14.501 --> 01:20:16.209
You're a lucky fellow, Louis.

01:20:16.292 --> 01:20:18.501
I never cease to be conscious of that.

01:20:18.876 --> 01:20:20.917
- Thank you.
- What do you think of Maud?

01:20:21.417 --> 01:20:22.876
A charming girl,

01:20:22.959 --> 01:20:26.251
though perhaps at times her conversation
is a little lacking in sparkle.

01:20:26.334 --> 01:20:28.709
Dullest woman I ever met in my life.

01:20:31.167 --> 01:20:32.959
Plain too.

01:20:33.584 --> 01:20:35.709
But good breeding stock.

01:20:38.292 --> 01:20:40.584
Good breeding stock, the Redpoles.

01:20:41.292 --> 01:20:43.501
And they litter a very
high proportion of boys.

01:20:45.876 --> 01:20:47.751
Do I gather you to mean...

01:20:47.834 --> 01:20:52.876
Spoke to old Lady Redpole this afternoon.
Only too glad to get the girl off her hands.

01:20:53.459 --> 01:20:54.834
My congratulations.

01:20:56.834 --> 01:20:58.917
Duty to the family, really.

01:20:59.542 --> 01:21:01.792
And when does the union take place?

01:21:01.876 --> 01:21:04.501
Very soon.
I'm not growing any younger.

01:21:04.584 --> 01:21:08.459
Mightn't get a son the first time.
Quiet wedding, I thought.

01:21:08.542 --> 01:21:10.626
Maud's hardly the type for St Margaret's.

01:21:11.792 --> 01:21:15.792
We shall honeymoon on the Riviera
and then go on to Italy afterwards.

01:21:15.876 --> 01:21:18.501
No sense inflicting her on one's friends.

01:21:20.292 --> 01:21:23.334
When she's got a family,
that'll keep her out of the way.

01:21:25.251 --> 01:21:28.209
<i>This news threw me into
such distress of mind</i>

01:21:28.292 --> 01:21:30.084
<i>that had I had poison
in my possession</i>

01:21:30.167 --> 01:21:33.334
<i>I would probably have administered it
to Ethelred there and then</i>

01:21:33.417 --> 01:21:35.792
<i>and chanced the consequent inquiries.</i>

01:21:37.376 --> 01:21:41.126
<i>One thing was clear,
if I did not succeed in disposing of him</i>

01:21:41.209 --> 01:21:43.626
<i>during this present visit
to the castle,</i>

01:21:43.709 --> 01:21:46.667
<i>I was likely to see the ruin
of my whole campaign.</i>

01:21:49.876 --> 01:21:52.709
My best wishes
for a successful outcome.

01:21:54.751 --> 01:21:57.001
<i>The next morning
I went out shooting with Ethelred</i>

01:21:57.084 --> 01:21:59.001
<i>or rather,
to watch Ethelred shooting</i>

01:21:59.084 --> 01:22:02.876
<i>for my principles will not allow me
to take a direct part in blood sports.</i>

01:22:02.959 --> 01:22:05.667
- Been round the traps this morning, Hoskins?
- Not yet, Your Grace.

01:22:05.751 --> 01:22:08.376
Sounds as if we've bagged one there.

01:22:08.459 --> 01:22:13.584
Ah. Been losing so much game lately,
we've started setting the mantraps again.

01:22:22.334 --> 01:22:26.667
Hoskins is now going to thrash you.
Then he'll let you go.

01:22:26.751 --> 01:22:29.917
Let this be a lesson to you
not to poach on my land.

01:22:40.792 --> 01:22:42.209
That'll do.

01:22:51.292 --> 01:22:54.501
Keep moving them around, Hoskins,
or they'll tell each other where they are.

01:22:54.584 --> 01:22:56.209
Yes, Your Grace.

01:22:58.001 --> 01:23:00.292
- I thought mantraps were illegal.
- They are.

01:23:01.001 --> 01:23:02.292
What happens if he tells the police?

01:23:02.376 --> 01:23:05.959
He comes up before the bench for poaching,
gets six months in jail.

01:23:06.042 --> 01:23:09.834
If he keeps his mouth shut,
he just gets a few days in bed.

01:23:10.417 --> 01:23:12.167
Which would you choose?

01:23:17.417 --> 01:23:20.876
Only way to deal with these ruffians,
I assure you.

01:23:20.959 --> 01:23:25.167
Oh. I must have dropped my cigarette case
back there. I'll catch you up.

01:23:42.709 --> 01:23:44.376
- Find it?
- Yes, thanks.

01:23:44.459 --> 01:23:48.042
Might have another walk round this afternoon,
if you feel like it.

01:23:49.001 --> 01:23:50.626
That would be most pleasant.

01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:55.209
<i>After luncheon we went out to
massacre a few more unfortunate birds.</i>

01:23:56.209 --> 01:23:58.209
- Listen.
- What is it?

01:23:58.292 --> 01:24:01.084
I thought I heard something,
like someone running through the bracken.

01:24:01.167 --> 01:24:03.459
Another poaching ruffian! Come on!

01:24:08.292 --> 01:24:10.584
There was someone here. Look.

01:24:12.292 --> 01:24:13.917
Blast!

01:24:14.001 --> 01:24:16.876
Louis, get me out of this. Hurry up, man.

01:24:21.084 --> 01:24:23.584
- Have you gone mad?
- Be quiet, Ethelred.

01:24:24.209 --> 01:24:26.376
I want to talk to you for a minute.

01:24:26.459 --> 01:24:29.542
If you make a noise,
I shall blow your head off at once.

01:24:31.417 --> 01:24:33.459
By the time anyone has heard the shot,

01:24:33.542 --> 01:24:37.001
I shall be running back toward the castle,
shouting for help.

01:24:38.042 --> 01:24:40.417
I shall say that you stepped on the trap

01:24:41.042 --> 01:24:43.959
and that your gun went off
accidentally as it fell.

01:24:44.042 --> 01:24:45.167
So be quiet.

01:24:46.626 --> 01:24:49.126
To spare you as much pain as possible,

01:24:49.584 --> 01:24:50.667
I'll be brief.

01:24:55.459 --> 01:24:57.917
When I've finished, I shall kill you.

01:24:59.626 --> 01:25:02.001
You'll be the sixth
D'Ascoyne that I've killed.

01:25:02.084 --> 01:25:03.459
You want to know why?

01:25:04.917 --> 01:25:07.792
In return for what
the D'Ascoynes did to my mother.

01:25:08.709 --> 01:25:13.959
Because she married for love
instead of for rank or money or land,

01:25:14.834 --> 01:25:18.167
they condemned her to a life
of poverty and slavery

01:25:18.251 --> 01:25:20.584
in a world with which
they had not equipped her to deal.

01:25:20.667 --> 01:25:23.709
You yourself refused to grant
her dying wish,

01:25:23.792 --> 01:25:25.876
which was to be buried here at Chalfont.

01:25:26.376 --> 01:25:29.834
When I saw her poor little coffin
slide underground,

01:25:30.417 --> 01:25:33.251
saw her exiled in death
as she'd been in life,

01:25:34.417 --> 01:25:38.084
I swore to have my revenge
on your intolerable pride.

01:25:40.251 --> 01:25:44.917
That revenge
I am just about to complete.

01:25:47.876 --> 01:25:50.001
It's clear that you are insane.

01:25:50.751 --> 01:25:52.001
Give me that gun at once.

01:25:52.626 --> 01:25:53.917
No.

01:25:56.251 --> 01:26:01.209
From here, I think, the wound should look
consistent with the story that I shall tell.

01:26:10.584 --> 01:26:11.709
Help!

01:26:12.792 --> 01:26:13.917
Help!

01:26:14.501 --> 01:26:15.667
Help!

01:26:17.126 --> 01:26:20.292
<i>And so Ethelred,
Eighth Duke of Chalfont,</i>

01:26:20.584 --> 01:26:23.376
<i>duly came to his place in the family vault.</i>

01:26:28.042 --> 01:26:30.501
<i>There were few D'Ascoynes
left to mourn him.</i>

01:26:30.584 --> 01:26:34.626
<i>My employer, who was Ninth Duke of Chalfont
for the shortest possible period,</i>

01:26:34.709 --> 01:26:38.209
<i>having expired of shock on hearing
that he had succeeded to the title.</i>

01:26:40.501 --> 01:26:45.001
<i>And so, I became
the 10th Duke of Chalfont.</i>

01:26:48.584 --> 01:26:52.001
<i>Fortunately, the Ninth Duke
had found time before he expired</i>

01:26:52.084 --> 01:26:55.459
<i>to make a will bequeathing to me
his interests in the business.</i>

01:26:58.292 --> 01:26:59.876
You may remove that.

01:27:08.209 --> 01:27:11.626
<i>A day or two later,
an affecting little feudal ceremony took place</i>

01:27:11.709 --> 01:27:13.459
<i>to welcome me into residence at the castle.</i>

01:27:13.542 --> 01:27:16.876
And I promise you
that my first consideration,

01:27:16.959 --> 01:27:21.542
and that of Mrs D'Ascoyne, who has done me
the honour to consent to be my bride,

01:27:22.126 --> 01:27:26.917
will be the welfare of the estate
and of the people who live on it.

01:27:27.001 --> 01:27:29.251
God bless you all.

01:27:36.584 --> 01:27:38.292
Long live His Grace!

01:27:38.376 --> 01:27:40.001
Long live His Grace.

01:27:47.001 --> 01:27:49.626
Pennyman, Your Grace,
from Sprockett's Farm.

01:27:49.709 --> 01:27:51.334
Mrs Pennyman.

01:27:51.417 --> 01:27:53.334
My son, Tom, from Sprockett's Farm.

01:27:54.001 --> 01:27:56.459
Mr Wyvold, from Sprockett's Farm.

01:27:57.917 --> 01:27:59.501
Sprockett's Farm?

01:28:00.959 --> 01:28:03.292
No, Your Grace. From Scotland Yard.

01:28:05.959 --> 01:28:07.501
Scotland Yard?

01:28:08.251 --> 01:28:10.126
A matter of some delicacy.

01:28:15.959 --> 01:28:17.459
Follow me, please.

01:28:17.959 --> 01:28:21.459
<i>The blow was so sudden that I
found it hard to collect my thoughts.</i>

01:28:23.167 --> 01:28:25.042
<i>Which of them could it be?</i>

01:28:25.834 --> 01:28:29.376
<i>Young Ascoyne? Henry? Ethelred?</i>

01:28:30.251 --> 01:28:33.584
<i>The parson? The general?</i>

01:28:33.667 --> 01:28:35.251
<i>Lady Agatha?</i>

01:28:35.334 --> 01:28:37.459
<i>Or could it be all of them?</i>

01:28:42.626 --> 01:28:43.959
Now.

01:28:44.042 --> 01:28:46.876
You are, I take it,
His Grace, the Duke of Chalfont?

01:28:46.959 --> 01:28:48.084
I am.

01:28:48.167 --> 01:28:52.667
I am Detective Inspector Burgoyne
of the Criminal Investigation Department.

01:28:52.751 --> 01:28:55.084
And I hold a warrant for your arrest
on a charge of murder.

01:28:55.501 --> 01:28:56.667
Murder?

01:28:57.376 --> 01:28:59.001
Of murdering Mr Lionel Holland at...

01:28:59.084 --> 01:29:00.251
Murdering whom?

01:29:00.334 --> 01:29:01.876
Mr Lionel Holland

01:29:01.959 --> 01:29:05.376
at number 242 Connaught Square,
Bayswater,

01:29:05.459 --> 01:29:07.626
on the 17th of October last.

01:29:18.292 --> 01:29:21.584
<i>Utterly bewildered,
I tried to fathom what series of events</i>

01:29:21.667 --> 01:29:24.834
<i>could conceivably have led
to this not-very-amusing irony.</i>

01:29:25.292 --> 01:29:27.626
<i>I could only suppose that Lionel
had actually carried out</i>

01:29:27.709 --> 01:29:29.459
<i>that drunken threat of suicide.</i>

01:29:30.667 --> 01:29:32.876
<i>But how then had the blame fallen on me?</i>

01:29:33.542 --> 01:29:36.876
<i>Time alone, and the trial,
would reveal the answer.</i>

01:29:36.959 --> 01:29:40.834
<i>Seeing no reason to forego any of
the available privileges of my rank...</i>

01:29:45.584 --> 01:29:48.501
<i>I exercised my right to be tried
before the House of Lords.</i>

01:29:48.584 --> 01:29:53.167
Louis D'Ascoyne Mazzini, Duke of Chalfont,

01:29:53.251 --> 01:29:56.126
you, as a peer of England,
are indicted for murder.

01:29:57.001 --> 01:29:58.709
How say you, Your Grace?

01:29:58.792 --> 01:30:02.667
Are you guilty of the felony with which
you are charged or not guilty?

01:30:03.209 --> 01:30:05.542
- Not guilty.
- How will you be tried?

01:30:07.209 --> 01:30:12.042
- By God and my peers.
- God send Your Grace a good deliverance.

01:30:12.459 --> 01:30:17.084
It shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth,

01:30:17.167 --> 01:30:18.751
so help me God.

01:30:19.417 --> 01:30:23.084
Mrs Holland, will you tell
Their Lordships in your own words

01:30:23.167 --> 01:30:25.417
the substance of the conversation
you had with your husband

01:30:25.542 --> 01:30:27.417
the evening before his death?

01:30:29.251 --> 01:30:32.417
He told me that Louis...the prisoner,

01:30:33.209 --> 01:30:36.334
was coming to see him the next day
on a rather delicate matter.

01:30:36.417 --> 01:30:38.417
Did he indicate what that matter was?

01:30:40.584 --> 01:30:43.667
He had discovered that
the prisoner and I had been...

01:30:45.209 --> 01:30:47.167
Had been on terms of intimacy?

01:30:48.584 --> 01:30:51.251
- Yes.
- And what was his attitude?

01:30:52.417 --> 01:30:55.209
He felt that the correct thing to do
was to tell him to his face

01:30:55.251 --> 01:30:58.084
that he intended to start
proceedings for divorce.

01:30:58.751 --> 01:31:00.209
From your knowledge of the prisoner

01:31:00.251 --> 01:31:02.667
how would you expect him
to receive that news?

01:31:04.251 --> 01:31:06.584
I should expect him to be very angry.

01:31:07.501 --> 01:31:10.917
Now he was heir to a dukedom,
he had no more use for me.

01:31:11.251 --> 01:31:14.167
I see. He was trying to discard you.

01:31:14.834 --> 01:31:15.917
Yes.

01:31:16.042 --> 01:31:19.376
Mrs Holland, I apologise for submitting you
to this ordeal

01:31:20.042 --> 01:31:23.876
but will you tell Their Lordships
how you found your husband's body?

01:31:26.251 --> 01:31:29.001
I came back about 4:30.

01:31:31.584 --> 01:31:35.167
Their Lordships have no objection
to the witness being seated.

01:31:39.584 --> 01:31:41.167
Yes, Mrs Holland?

01:31:43.042 --> 01:31:45.251
I came back about 4:30.

01:31:45.917 --> 01:31:48.251
I went into my husband's study.

01:31:49.001 --> 01:31:51.501
He was lying on the floor

01:31:52.501 --> 01:31:54.667
with a dagger stuck in his chest.

01:31:55.376 --> 01:31:56.917
One last question, Mrs Holland.

01:31:57.584 --> 01:32:01.084
Had your husband ever, at any time,
threatened suicide?

01:32:02.084 --> 01:32:04.709
- Never.
- Thank you, Mrs Holland.

01:32:07.876 --> 01:32:10.251
My client craves
Their Lordships' permission

01:32:10.334 --> 01:32:12.251
to cross-examine the witness himself.

01:32:12.917 --> 01:32:14.917
Their Lordships grant their permission.

01:32:18.584 --> 01:32:22.584
Mrs Holland, you understand
the meaning of being on oath?

01:32:22.667 --> 01:32:24.542
Of course.

01:32:26.251 --> 01:32:29.876
You realise that a life may depend upon
the truthfulness of your evidence?

01:32:32.001 --> 01:32:33.251
Yes.

01:32:35.251 --> 01:32:37.751
I put it to you that your story
of your conversation with your husband

01:32:37.876 --> 01:32:40.501
on the night before his death
is a complete fabrication.

01:32:40.584 --> 01:32:42.042
It is not.

01:32:43.251 --> 01:32:45.501
I put it to you
that your husband committed suicide.

01:32:45.917 --> 01:32:48.751
He would never have done that
without leaving a message for me.

01:32:48.876 --> 01:32:50.751
Can you swear that he did not?

01:32:52.084 --> 01:32:54.084
The police searched the room
very thoroughly.

01:32:55.667 --> 01:32:57.417
They didn't find anything.

01:32:58.917 --> 01:33:03.501
I suggest that your evidence is a tissue
of lies dictated by motives of revenge.

01:33:08.542 --> 01:33:10.334
It is not.

01:33:10.917 --> 01:33:12.417
It is not.

01:33:12.501 --> 01:33:16.417
I presume that the prisoner has some
purpose in these submissions

01:33:16.501 --> 01:33:18.376
other than that of distressing the witness.

01:33:19.042 --> 01:33:21.209
My purpose, my lord,
is to determine the truth.

01:33:22.167 --> 01:33:25.417
That, Your Grace,
is the whole purpose of this assembly.

01:33:27.751 --> 01:33:31.667
...the whole truth and nothing but the truth,
so help me God.

01:33:35.209 --> 01:33:38.667
You're Edith D'Ascoyne Mazzini,
Duchess of Chalfont?

01:33:38.751 --> 01:33:40.001
I am.

01:33:40.084 --> 01:33:42.917
When and where did you become
the wife of the accused?

01:33:43.584 --> 01:33:46.251
Yesterday morning, in Pentonville Prison.

01:33:47.751 --> 01:33:50.751
I wanted to publish irrevocably
before the whole world

01:33:51.501 --> 01:33:52.917
my faith in his innocence.

01:33:54.876 --> 01:33:57.001
I wanted to show by my marriage

01:33:57.917 --> 01:34:00.334
that though he was led astray,
as I believe

01:34:00.417 --> 01:34:03.334
by that innate kindliness
and courtesy of his

01:34:03.417 --> 01:34:06.376
which made it so hard for him to rebuff
the advances of a woman,

01:34:07.084 --> 01:34:08.667
I nevertheless regard him as a man

01:34:08.751 --> 01:34:11.167
to whom I can happily entrust
the remainder of my life.

01:34:11.751 --> 01:34:14.084
I am not alone
in these opinions of him.

01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:16.542
My late husband, Henry,

01:34:16.584 --> 01:34:18.709
and his late Uncle Ethelred,
the Eighth Duke,

01:34:19.751 --> 01:34:22.751
both unfortunately
unable to testify today...

01:34:23.751 --> 01:34:27.709
These and other members of the
D'Ascoyne family, had they been alive,

01:34:27.751 --> 01:34:30.542
would, I know, have echoed
every word that I have said.

01:34:31.251 --> 01:34:33.084
Thank you, Your Grace.

01:34:34.417 --> 01:34:36.251
The deceased was a client
of the banking house

01:34:36.376 --> 01:34:38.417
of which you are chairman
and managing director.

01:34:38.542 --> 01:34:39.667
He was.

01:34:39.751 --> 01:34:44.042
In the normal course of business transactions
he would have come to see you at your office.

01:34:44.084 --> 01:34:45.209
Yes.

01:34:45.251 --> 01:34:47.542
Instead of which,
he asked you to go to his house.

01:34:47.584 --> 01:34:48.667
Yes.

01:34:48.751 --> 01:34:51.251
He invited you to his house
to discuss business.

01:34:51.334 --> 01:34:52.417
Yes.

01:34:52.501 --> 01:34:54.584
And you ask Their Lordships
to believe that?

01:34:55.167 --> 01:34:56.334
Yes.

01:34:56.917 --> 01:34:59.084
In the course of this, business discussion

01:34:59.167 --> 01:35:02.584
he burst into tears, fell on his knees
and threatened suicide.

01:35:02.709 --> 01:35:05.584
- Yes.
- Is that usual in business discussions?

01:35:06.084 --> 01:35:08.709
- Not usual. No.
- But it happened on this occasion.

01:35:08.792 --> 01:35:12.042
- Yes.
- And you ask Their Lordships to believe that?

01:35:12.542 --> 01:35:14.126
Yes.

01:35:14.209 --> 01:35:16.959
Then this, business discussion
became so heated

01:35:17.042 --> 01:35:20.251
that blows were exchanged
and he made a murderous attack on you.

01:35:20.334 --> 01:35:21.501
Yes.

01:35:21.584 --> 01:35:24.376
- Is that usual in business discussion?
- No.

01:35:24.459 --> 01:35:27.792
- But it happened on this occasion.
- Yes.

01:35:27.876 --> 01:35:32.042
- And you ask Their Lordships to believe that?
- Yes.

01:35:32.792 --> 01:35:33.917
Very well.

01:35:34.751 --> 01:35:38.209
You've heard of cases of a jealous husband
and his wife's lover coming to blows?

01:35:38.709 --> 01:35:40.626
- Yes.
- Frequently?

01:35:41.251 --> 01:35:44.001
It is one of the clichÃ©s
of the cheaper kind of fiction.

01:35:47.792 --> 01:35:51.209
I put it to you that, in this case,
it happened not in fiction,

01:35:51.292 --> 01:35:52.501
but in fact.

01:35:52.584 --> 01:35:55.792
- I put it to you that it did not.
- I put it to you further

01:35:55.876 --> 01:35:59.751
that being unaware at that time
of your future wife's forgiving nature

01:35:59.834 --> 01:36:02.709
you assumed that if you were cited
in a divorce suit

01:36:02.792 --> 01:36:06.376
it would ruin your chances
of making this advantageous match

01:36:06.459 --> 01:36:08.917
with a wealthy and beautiful woman.

01:36:10.042 --> 01:36:11.709
No. Not at all.

01:36:11.792 --> 01:36:15.959
Still, you were proposing
to discard Mrs Holland.

01:36:16.042 --> 01:36:17.501
No.

01:36:17.584 --> 01:36:20.959
Even though you were
about to be married to the other lady?

01:36:28.209 --> 01:36:31.667
I must confess to feeling
quite intrigued as to their decision.

01:36:40.917 --> 01:36:45.959
My lords, the question
for Your Lordships is this...

01:36:47.167 --> 01:36:49.209
Is the prisoner guilty

01:36:49.292 --> 01:36:52.917
of the felony whereof
he stands indicted

01:36:53.001 --> 01:36:55.001
or not guilty?

01:36:58.376 --> 01:36:59.917
Guilty, upon mine honour.

01:37:01.042 --> 01:37:03.209
Guilty, upon mine honour.

01:37:04.001 --> 01:37:06.542
Guilty, upon mine honour.

01:37:14.542 --> 01:37:18.626
I considered it both seemly and touching
that my dear wife should visit me

01:37:18.709 --> 01:37:21.542
as she did this morning,
to make her farewells.

01:37:22.834 --> 01:37:26.084
Your arrival, on the other hand,
appears to me unseemly

01:37:26.167 --> 01:37:28.126
and tasteless in the extreme.

01:37:28.876 --> 01:37:32.709
I couldn't bear my last sight of you
to be that look of hatred you gave me

01:37:32.834 --> 01:37:34.584
as you went out from the trial.

01:37:35.542 --> 01:37:39.709
In view of the fact that your evidence
had put the rope round my neck

01:37:39.792 --> 01:37:42.667
you could hardly expect
a glance of warm affection.

01:37:42.751 --> 01:37:46.001
- Isn't there any hope?
- What hope could there be?

01:37:47.334 --> 01:37:49.542
I was only thinking.

01:37:49.626 --> 01:37:51.959
That question you asked at the trial

01:37:52.834 --> 01:37:55.417
about Lionel leaving a suicide note...

01:37:56.667 --> 01:38:00.084
Suppose he did?
Suppose that one were found

01:38:00.167 --> 01:38:03.084
even now, this last evening?

01:38:03.959 --> 01:38:07.459
- It would savour of a miracle.
- Miracles can happen.

01:38:08.626 --> 01:38:10.459
Miracles <i>could</i> happen.

01:38:15.167 --> 01:38:16.417
I see.

01:38:17.917 --> 01:38:20.792
Oh, strange, isn't it, how things turn out?

01:38:20.876 --> 01:38:23.501
Now, if you had married me,
instead of Edith...

01:38:24.334 --> 01:38:26.959
Or you had married me,
instead of Lionel.

01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:29.167
He would still be alive,

01:38:29.251 --> 01:38:32.209
and you wouldn't be going
to be hanged tomorrow morning.

01:38:33.209 --> 01:38:36.126
Unless, of course,
you've murdered somebody else.

01:38:40.376 --> 01:38:42.376
All of which is rather beside the point,
isn't it?

01:38:42.459 --> 01:38:43.542
Is it?

01:38:46.167 --> 01:38:48.501
Do you remember in the old days

01:38:48.584 --> 01:38:51.834
how we used to play
Eeny, meeny, miny, mo?

01:38:51.917 --> 01:38:56.876
- Catch a nigger by his toe.
- If he hollers, let him go. Out goes he.

01:38:58.292 --> 01:39:01.834
Quite a lot of little niggers have gone out,
haven't they, one way or another?

01:39:02.834 --> 01:39:05.792
And every one of them a D'Ascoyne.

01:39:09.792 --> 01:39:12.501
We do seem to be
a very short-lived family.

01:39:13.459 --> 01:39:17.042
Of course, Edith is only
a D'Ascoyne by marriage

01:39:17.126 --> 01:39:19.501
so I suppose
her prospects are better.

01:39:22.709 --> 01:39:24.209
Except for a miracle.

01:39:24.876 --> 01:39:27.209
Like the other one
we were talking about.

01:39:27.292 --> 01:39:31.126
<i>So there it was.
She would find the suicide note</i>

01:39:31.209 --> 01:39:33.792
<i>if I, in return, would murder Edith.</i>

01:39:34.876 --> 01:39:37.334
So we now have two miracles in mind, do we?

01:39:38.042 --> 01:39:39.167
Yes.

01:39:39.251 --> 01:39:42.709
I wonder if they are, in any way,
dependent on each other?

01:39:44.376 --> 01:39:46.542
I suppose perhaps they might be.

01:39:48.542 --> 01:39:50.334
What do you think?

01:39:52.126 --> 01:39:53.501
Time's up.

01:39:58.376 --> 01:40:00.084
What do you think?

01:40:01.501 --> 01:40:05.584
Poor Edith. I'm afraid all this is going
to take years off her life.

01:40:09.251 --> 01:40:12.667
<i>- Au revoir,</i> Louis.
<i>- Au revoir.</i>

01:40:13.876 --> 01:40:15.792
<i>What could I do but accept?</i>

01:40:15.876 --> 01:40:19.001
<i>After all, I could always decide afterwards</i>

01:40:19.084 --> 01:40:22.126
<i>which of these two little niggers
would finally have to go.</i>

01:40:22.209 --> 01:40:23.709
<i>Dear Edith.</i>

01:40:24.417 --> 01:40:26.542
<i>Captivating Sibella.</i>

01:40:26.626 --> 01:40:30.251
<i>How different they were,
and how well I knew each of them.</i>

01:40:31.126 --> 01:40:32.501
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

01:40:33.334 --> 01:40:36.167
<i>But the night has gone by
and nothing has happened.</i>

01:40:36.751 --> 01:40:39.001
<i>It is now but a few minutes to 8:00.</i>

01:40:39.084 --> 01:40:43.167
<i>And I realise that Sibella
came yesterday merely to tantalise,</i>

01:40:43.251 --> 01:40:46.251
<i>to raise my hopes
in order to dash them again.</i>

01:40:46.334 --> 01:40:48.792
<i>How unlike me not to have guessed.</i>

01:40:49.626 --> 01:40:53.459
<i>But, after all, how very like Sibella.</i>

01:41:17.834 --> 01:41:19.167
Already?

01:41:20.667 --> 01:41:22.876
I'll tell you who time gallops withal.

01:41:22.959 --> 01:41:24.584
"With a thief to the gallows,

01:41:24.667 --> 01:41:29.834
"for though he tread as softly as foot can fall,
he thinks himself too soon there."

01:41:30.959 --> 01:41:32.501
If you have any last instructions...

01:41:32.584 --> 01:41:36.376
I think, Colonel, it only remains
to thank you for your many kindnesses.

01:41:37.084 --> 01:41:38.751
Won't you introduce our friend?

01:41:40.709 --> 01:41:44.084
Mr Elliott, His Grace,
the Duke of Chalfont.

01:41:46.084 --> 01:41:47.584
Good morning, Your Grace.

01:41:48.501 --> 01:41:50.126
This won't take a moment.

01:41:50.834 --> 01:41:54.584
First, if Your Grace
will pardon the liberty

01:41:54.667 --> 01:41:57.334
I should like to read some verses

01:41:57.417 --> 01:42:01.209
composed by myself for use
on these melancholy occasions.

01:42:02.584 --> 01:42:05.042
- Your Grace permits?
- With pleasure.

01:42:10.417 --> 01:42:13.042
"My friend, reflect."

01:42:13.626 --> 01:42:16.209
Oh. Pardon.

01:42:17.042 --> 01:42:19.251
"Your Grace, reflect.

01:42:19.834 --> 01:42:25.084
"While yet of mortal breath,
some span however short, is left to thee

01:42:25.792 --> 01:42:30.209
"how brief the total span
twixt birth and death

01:42:30.292 --> 01:42:35.167
"how long thy coming tenure of eternity.

01:42:37.417 --> 01:42:40.167
"Your Grace, prepare..."

01:42:44.334 --> 01:42:46.209
Colonel.

01:42:51.209 --> 01:42:52.459
Your Grace,

01:42:52.542 --> 01:42:54.292
I am happy to inform you
that a telephone communication

01:42:54.376 --> 01:42:56.417
has just been received
from the Home Office.

01:42:56.501 --> 01:42:59.501
A note has been found,
undoubtedly in Mr Holland's handwriting

01:42:59.584 --> 01:43:02.376
expressing his intention to commit suicide.

01:43:02.459 --> 01:43:03.584
It is a miracle.

01:43:04.626 --> 01:43:07.292
Yes. It is like a miracle.

01:43:08.667 --> 01:43:10.209
Pending receipt of further instructions,

01:43:10.292 --> 01:43:13.626
I will try to make you reasonably
comfortable in my quarters.

01:43:14.876 --> 01:43:17.417
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Your Grace, sir.

01:43:25.501 --> 01:43:29.376
I assure you I have never been more
happy to be relieved of an official duty.

01:43:30.501 --> 01:43:31.876
Poor Elliott.

01:43:32.417 --> 01:43:34.751
If he had not insisted
on reading that abominable poem,

01:43:34.834 --> 01:43:38.042
he would have had me neatly dangling at the
end of his rope before the news arrived.

01:43:39.417 --> 01:43:41.292
He was so looking forward to it.

01:43:41.376 --> 01:43:43.459
I understand, Your Grace,
from the men on duty outside

01:43:43.542 --> 01:43:45.834
that a large crowd awaits your leaving.

01:43:45.917 --> 01:43:47.709
Having robbed them
of the pleasure of my death

01:43:47.792 --> 01:43:49.667
the least I can do is to
let them see me alive.

01:43:50.459 --> 01:43:53.667
Including, by the way,
not only Her Grace, the Duchess,

01:43:53.751 --> 01:43:55.501
but also Mrs Holland.

01:43:55.584 --> 01:43:56.959
Oh.

01:43:57.626 --> 01:43:59.209
How does the song go?

01:43:59.292 --> 01:44:03.542
"How happy could I be with either
were t'other dear charmer away."

01:44:03.626 --> 01:44:04.667
Well, good-bye.

01:44:04.751 --> 01:44:06.709
Good-bye, Your Grace.

01:44:39.417 --> 01:44:41.834
"How happy could I be with either

01:44:41.917 --> 01:44:44.126
"were t'other dear charmer away."

01:44:46.292 --> 01:44:48.542
- Your Grace.
- Yes?

01:44:49.251 --> 01:44:51.667
I represent the magazine <i>Titbits</i>

01:44:51.751 --> 01:44:53.626
by whom I'm commissioned
to approach you

01:44:53.709 --> 01:44:56.001
for the publication rights
of your memoirs.

01:44:56.459 --> 01:44:57.959
My memoirs?

01:44:59.084 --> 01:45:00.501
My memoirs.

01:45:03.376 --> 01:45:05.292
My memoirs.
