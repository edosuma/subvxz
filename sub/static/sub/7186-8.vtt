<i>¶ Just off the shores</i>

00:09.276 --> 00:10.976
<i>¶ A hideaway at sea </i>

00:10.978 --> 00:12.611
- Yo-ho!
- Yo-ho!

00:12.613 --> 00:14.246
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

00:14.248 --> 00:15.881

00:15.883 --> 00:17.249

00:17.251 --> 00:18.717

00:29.997 --> 00:32.965

<i>We need some volunteers ¶</i>

00:32.967 --> 00:34.700

00:34.702 --> 00:36.235

<i>- Ahoy!</i>

Yooo, yo-ho!

Let's go!

00:52.586 --> 00:54.086
<i>¶ We'll set</i>

¶ Come on and join the crew

00:57.123 --> 00:58.590
Yo-ho, let's go!

00:58.592 --> 01:00.159
Ha-har!

01:01.694 --> 01:03.228
Ahoy, mateys!

01:03.230 --> 01:05.898
Do you want to join
my pirate crew?

01:07.300 --> 01:08.333
Great!

01:08.335 --> 01:10.002
To start
today's adventure,

01:10.004 --> 01:12.771
everybody say
the Pirate Password.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.673
Yo-ho-ho!

01:14.675 --> 01:16.642
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:16.644 --> 01:17.910
One more time.

01:17.912 --> 01:19.745
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:23.616 --> 01:25.984
[Jake] A Feather in Hook's Hat.

01:27.854 --> 01:31.924
Shiver me timbers! Sea serpent
of the starboard bow.

01:31.926 --> 01:34.660
[roars]

01:34.662 --> 01:37.663
Step lively, crew!
Save the ship!

01:37.665 --> 01:39.331
[Skully] Aye-aye, Captain Jake!

01:39.333 --> 01:41.867
I say, Smee.
Don't those puny pirates

01:41.869 --> 01:44.269
know that ship
has already sunk,

01:44.271 --> 01:46.638
and it's stuck in the sand?

01:46.640 --> 01:49.141
[Smee] I think
they're pretending, cap'n.

01:49.143 --> 01:54.279
Aye, and spy that cool feather
Captain Jake be wearin'!

01:54.281 --> 01:55.981
Let me see
that feather!

01:55.983 --> 01:58.383
[gasps]
The sail is stuck!

01:58.385 --> 02:03.255
Captain Jake will
take care of everything!

02:05.992 --> 02:08.727
Whoo-hoo! We saved the ship!

02:08.729 --> 02:10.996
But look what happened
to Jake's feather!

02:10.998 --> 02:15.367
Oh, poor little sea pup.
It was such a nice feather.

02:15.369 --> 02:18.003
- So colorful.
- So cool!

02:18.005 --> 02:20.706
What?!
How about my feather?

02:20.708 --> 02:24.376
Oh, yes,
it is very nice, cap'n.

02:24.378 --> 02:26.812
But did you see
Jake's feather?

02:26.814 --> 02:30.048
That one has
real pirate pizzazz!

02:30.050 --> 02:31.917
Pizzazz, you say?

02:31.919 --> 02:36.688
Oh. Perhaps my plume
could use a pinch more.

02:36.690 --> 02:39.825
Barnacles!
My feather's ruined.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.927
We can get another one,
right?

02:41.929 --> 02:45.664
Maybe. I got this feather
from the Sing-Songbird.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.699
All I had to do
was ask her nicely.

02:47.701 --> 02:51.069
Maybe if we find her,
she'll give you a new feather.

02:51.071 --> 02:52.871
All we have to do
is go to where

02:52.873 --> 02:55.874
the Sing-Songbird
lives on Never Land.

02:55.876 --> 02:58.677
[Cubby]
In Buccaneer Bird Bluff!

02:58.679 --> 03:02.414
- Did you hear that, boys?
- Yes, cap'n.

03:02.416 --> 03:05.751
If we ask the Sing-Songbird
nicely, she'll give us a...

03:05.753 --> 03:09.421
Never mind that.
Find me that bird!

03:09.423 --> 03:12.791
I want to get that
new feather before Jake does.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.760
- Aye-aye!
- Yes, sir, cap'n!

03:14.762 --> 03:19.798
Say, mateys, will you help me
get a new feather for my hat?

03:21.434 --> 03:25.003
Great! Remember to keep
a lookout for gold doubloons.

03:25.005 --> 03:28.707
Whenever we solve
a pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

03:28.709 --> 03:32.010
Then we'll collect 'em
and put' 'em in our
Team Treasure Chest.

03:32.012 --> 03:34.213
Is everybody ready?

03:34.215 --> 03:36.882
- I've got my sword!
- I got my map!

03:36.884 --> 03:39.051
And I've got
my pixie dust!

03:39.053 --> 03:42.421
The fairies gave it to me
so that we can use it to fly!

03:42.423 --> 03:44.823
But only in emergencies.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.925
Yo-ho, let's go!

03:51.030 --> 03:54.066
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away! </i>

03:54.068 --> 03:56.368
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

03:56.370 --> 04:01.406
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

04:01.408 --> 04:04.276
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

04:04.278 --> 04:06.111
<i>¶ And me </i>

04:09.148 --> 04:12.084
- [Sing-Songbird humming]
- A-ha!

04:12.086 --> 04:14.786
That must be
the Sing-Songbird.

04:14.788 --> 04:18.790
[continues humming]

04:18.792 --> 04:21.293
And she can't even fly!

04:22.028 --> 04:23.161
[both shouting]

04:23.163 --> 04:26.131
Give me your finest
feather this instant!

04:26.133 --> 04:28.900
- [coos indistinctly]
- [grunts]

04:28.902 --> 04:32.938
Blasted bird!
I want that feather!

04:32.940 --> 04:34.840
<i>¶ Coo-coo-coo! </i>

04:34.842 --> 04:39.811
Ahoy! Thar she blows.
And thar she goes!

04:41.080 --> 04:43.348
The Sing-Songbird
looks scared.

04:43.350 --> 04:45.517
And I know why.
Captain Hook!

04:45.519 --> 04:47.819
Out of me way, puny pirates!

04:47.821 --> 04:51.123
I'm going to grab
the feathers off that bird

04:51.125 --> 04:53.058
if it's the last thing I do!

04:54.193 --> 04:56.795
- [squawks]
- Move, move, move!

04:56.797 --> 04:58.530
Aw, coconuts!

04:58.532 --> 05:01.466
If Hook scares off
the Sing-Songbird,

05:01.468 --> 05:03.835
we'll never get
a new feather for Jake!

05:03.837 --> 05:07.372
- Hook on the double! Quick!
- Coo! Coo-coo.

05:07.374 --> 05:09.841
Then we'd better help her
get away from Hook!

05:12.578 --> 05:15.347
[Sing-Songbird humming]

05:15.349 --> 05:18.950
Boiling bilgewater.
We lost the bird!

05:18.952 --> 05:22.354
Maybe the Tiki Trees
will tell you where she went.

05:22.356 --> 05:24.890
If you ask nicely, cap'n.

05:24.892 --> 05:28.293
Tree, tell me
where that bird is!

05:28.295 --> 05:30.896
[Jamaican accent] Oh, don't know
a ting about it, mon.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.197
Now go away!

05:32.199 --> 05:34.866
I command you to tell me
where that bird went!

05:34.868 --> 05:38.503
Crackers! Hook's trying to
get help from the Tiki Trees!

05:38.505 --> 05:40.906
But the Tiki Trees
won't help him.

05:40.908 --> 05:43.575
Say, that gives me an idea.

05:43.577 --> 05:46.278
What if we pretended
to be Tiki Trees?

05:46.280 --> 05:50.916
Then we could give directions to
Captain Hook, and slow him down.

05:50.918 --> 05:54.886
And that'll give
the Sing-Songbird
time to get away!

05:56.956 --> 05:59.024
For the last time,
where did that bird...

05:59.026 --> 06:00.659
[Jake imitating Tree]
Captain Hook, mon.

06:00.661 --> 06:03.328
Heard you were looking
for directions.

06:03.330 --> 06:06.498
Finally!
Trees I can talk to.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.034
Which way did
that bird go?

06:09.036 --> 06:13.271
- You go dis way!
- Or you can go dis way!

06:13.273 --> 06:15.507
Or dat way!

06:15.509 --> 06:18.176
Whichever way you want,
you can go!

06:18.178 --> 06:22.013
Oh, dear,
now, which way do we go?

06:22.015 --> 06:26.651
This way, you bumblers.
Follow me!

06:27.653 --> 06:30.589
- Over the rail, mates!
- [all shouting]

06:32.959 --> 06:35.627
Yay-hey! We gave
the Sing-Songbird

06:35.629 --> 06:37.963
a chance to
get away from Hook.

06:37.965 --> 06:40.298
And we got four
gold doubloons!

06:40.300 --> 06:42.634
Let's grab 'em,
find the Sing-Songbird,

06:42.636 --> 06:45.237
and ask her nicely
for a feather!

06:48.408 --> 06:51.176
<i>¶ Ba-ba-ba-ba-boo</i>
<i>How are you? ¶</i>

06:51.178 --> 06:53.078
¶ Coo-coo-coo

06:53.080 --> 06:55.947
<i>¶ Ba-ba-ba-ba-boo</i>
<i>I like to sing with you ¶</i>

06:55.949 --> 06:57.616
¶ Coo-coo-coo

06:57.618 --> 06:59.951
<i>- ¶ Ba-ba-ba-ba-boo </i>
<i>- ¶ Coo-coo-coo! </i>

06:59.953 --> 07:02.087
Whoo-hoo!
Catchy tune.

07:02.089 --> 07:05.290
Yeah! The Sing-Songbird
and Sandy the Starfish

07:05.292 --> 07:09.528
- make a great team.
- [Hook] Get me that bird!

07:09.530 --> 07:11.329
[Sing-Songbird hums]

07:11.331 --> 07:13.932
Cracked crackers!
Hook's back.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.567
We've gotta
keep him busy

07:15.569 --> 07:18.203
so he doesn't scare the
Sing-Songbird away again.

07:18.205 --> 07:20.038
But if Hook can
hear her singing,

07:20.040 --> 07:21.540
he'll just
keep chasing her.

07:21.542 --> 07:25.944
Maybe if we all sang,
he wouldn't know who to chase!

07:25.946 --> 07:28.313
Treasure of a plan, Cubby!

07:28.315 --> 07:31.583
Let's all play
"hide and go sing!"

07:31.585 --> 07:35.320
Show yourself, bird!
I want that feather!

07:35.322 --> 07:38.457
<i>¶ Coo-coo-coo</i>
<i>I don't want to see you ¶</i>

07:38.459 --> 07:40.959
I hears her, cap'n!
Over here!

07:40.961 --> 07:45.063
<i>¶ Coo-coo-coo</i>
<i>I'm not afraid of you ¶</i>

07:45.065 --> 07:46.731
No, over there!

07:46.733 --> 07:49.000
[both grunt]

07:49.002 --> 07:50.702
<i>¶ Coo-coo-coo </i>

07:50.704 --> 07:54.206
A-ha! That bird's singing
is coming from behind that rock.

07:54.208 --> 07:59.077
I've got you! [screams]

07:59.079 --> 08:03.782
Yay-hey! We stopped
Captain Hook from scaring
the Sing-Songbird!

08:03.784 --> 08:06.485
And we got three
more gold doubloons!

08:06.487 --> 08:09.621
Let's grab 'em and go
find the Sing-Songbird,

08:09.623 --> 08:11.690
and ask her for a feather!

08:15.461 --> 08:19.397
Whoo-hoo! Welcome
to Buccaneer Bird Bluff,

08:19.399 --> 08:22.767
home of the Sing-Songbird!

08:22.769 --> 08:25.337
[humming]

08:25.339 --> 08:28.740
Maybe now I can ask her
for a new feather for my hat.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.475
Come on!

08:30.477 --> 08:34.246
- Tweet, tweet, tweet!
- Coo-coo!

08:34.248 --> 08:37.549
I'm a bird too! So...

08:37.551 --> 08:39.584
...give me
your feathers!

08:39.586 --> 08:43.555
Yo-ho, what do you know.
Hook's back... again!

08:43.557 --> 08:46.124
And he's tryin' to
trick the Sing-Songbird

08:46.126 --> 08:48.126
into thinkin' he's a bird!

08:48.128 --> 08:49.694
Mateys,
we need to keep

08:49.696 --> 08:51.663
Hook away from
the Sing-Songbird.

08:51.665 --> 08:55.066
- Izzy?
- I'm on it, Jake.

08:55.068 --> 08:58.069
Pixie dust, away!

08:58.071 --> 09:01.339
- A-ha!
- Captain Hook,
if you're a bird,

09:01.341 --> 09:04.342
- you've gotta fly!
- Ooh!

09:04.344 --> 09:08.346
Look at me, Smee!
I'm flying like a birdie.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.515
[chortling]

09:10.517 --> 09:12.217
[grunts]

09:12.219 --> 09:14.386
Yay-hey, yes-way!

09:14.388 --> 09:17.355
We stopped Captain Hook
from scaring the Sing-Songbird

09:17.357 --> 09:19.090
and taking her feathers.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.593
And we got five
more gold doubloons.

09:21.595 --> 09:26.698
- Let's grab 'em and go!
- Oh, the poor cap'n.

09:26.700 --> 09:30.569
All he wanted was a nice,
new feather for his hat.

09:30.571 --> 09:34.606
Aye, if only he
would have asked nicely.

09:34.608 --> 09:37.142
I kinda
feel sorry for Hook.

09:37.144 --> 09:39.611
He'll learn to ask
for things nicely someday,

09:39.613 --> 09:42.280
but I can do it
for him today.

09:42.282 --> 09:46.284
Ahoy, Sing-Songbird!
I'm sorry if Hook scared you.

09:46.286 --> 09:49.087
He doesn't know how
to ask for anything nicely.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.556
So could you please
give me a feather for him?

09:51.558 --> 09:53.458
Coo-coo-for him.

09:55.127 --> 09:56.861
Coo-coo for you!

09:56.863 --> 09:59.598
Thank you,
Sing-Songbird.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.166
Ahoy, Captain Hook.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.368
Would you like a new
feather for your hat?

10:03.370 --> 10:06.137
Never, if it's
coming from you!

10:06.139 --> 10:08.173
Well, I'll just
leave it here,

10:08.175 --> 10:10.108
in case you
change your mind.

10:13.145 --> 10:15.180
Ooh. A-ha!

10:15.182 --> 10:19.884
At last I have a feather
with real pirate pizzazz!

10:19.886 --> 10:21.219
[bird screeches]

10:21.854 --> 10:24.723
Save me, Smee!

10:26.859 --> 10:28.760
Blast!

10:31.631 --> 10:32.897
Thanks for helping us

10:32.899 --> 10:34.799
keep the Sing-Songbird
safe, mateys.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.535
And thanks for helping me
get a new feather for my hat.

10:37.537 --> 10:39.638
Now, let's put
all our gold doubloons

10:39.640 --> 10:42.240
into our Team Treasure Chest.

10:49.548 --> 10:51.583
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

10:51.585 --> 10:53.685
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

10:53.687 --> 10:55.787
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>with help from you ¶</i>

10:55.789 --> 10:58.523
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

10:58.525 --> 11:00.992
Come on, count with us!

11:02.261 --> 11:03.595
[all] Yeah!

11:04.664 --> 11:08.433
[Jake] One, two, three, four...

11:08.435 --> 11:10.802
[Cubby] Five, six, seven...

11:10.804 --> 11:15.373
[Izzy] Eight, nine, ten,
11, 12!

11:15.375 --> 11:18.510
Yo-ho! For solving
pirate problems today,

11:18.512 --> 11:21.212
we got 12 gold doubloons!

11:22.481 --> 11:26.217
I gotta say, Jake,
that is one fine feather.

11:26.219 --> 11:30.255
- And I ought to know.
- Thanks, Skully.

11:30.257 --> 11:32.457
<i>¶ Captain Jake</i>
<i>he went to sea ¶</i>

11:32.459 --> 11:33.958
<i>¶ Sailing in a dinghy </i>

11:33.960 --> 11:36.828
<i>¶ He wore a parrot</i>
<i>on his hat ¶</i>

11:36.830 --> 11:39.330
<i>¶ And made up</i>
<i>this song I'm singing ¶</i>

11:39.332 --> 11:42.467
Crackers!
Jake cracks me up.

11:45.871 --> 11:48.673
Isn't my new
feather magnificent?

11:48.675 --> 11:52.243
It's so much nicer
than that old one!

11:52.245 --> 11:54.512
Gee, it looks just
like your old feath...

11:54.514 --> 11:56.748
- [grunts]
- Oh, yes, cap'n!

11:56.750 --> 12:01.386
Your new feather really
gives you pirate pizzazz!

12:01.388 --> 12:06.424
Oh, it makes you
look so much more
great and glorious!

12:06.426 --> 12:07.959
And cool!

12:07.961 --> 12:12.430
Right you are, boys.
Oh, I'm cool.

12:16.302 --> 12:17.869
<i>[Jake]</i> A Whale of a Tale.

12:18.971 --> 12:21.973
[chuckling]
I've done it!

12:21.975 --> 12:24.909
At last! Success!

12:24.911 --> 12:29.848
[chuckles] Oh, but this is
a mighty special day, cap'n.

12:29.850 --> 12:32.917
You finally found a treasure
without taking it from Jake

12:32.919 --> 12:36.287
and his plucky little
sea pu... uh... uh...

12:36.289 --> 12:40.859
I mean, you finally found a
treasure all on your own, sir.

12:40.861 --> 12:43.895
How right you are, Mr. Smee!

12:43.897 --> 12:46.498
Bones, Sharky!
What's taking so long?

12:46.500 --> 12:49.567
- [both grunting]
- We're hard at work, cap'n!

12:49.569 --> 12:51.870
Why are you whispering?

12:51.872 --> 12:54.372
It's nappy time. Looky!

12:55.608 --> 12:57.342
[snoring]

12:59.445 --> 13:01.613
Stop gawking
at that whale

13:01.615 --> 13:04.015
and haul
the treasure aboard.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.884
Oh, here,
I'll do it meself!

13:05.886 --> 13:06.951
What?!

13:08.988 --> 13:11.790
[grunting]

13:12.992 --> 13:15.293
Now look what you've done!

13:15.295 --> 13:16.427
[gasps]

13:20.566 --> 13:22.367
[gulps, belches]

13:22.369 --> 13:24.068
[whining]

13:25.871 --> 13:28.039
Jumpin' jackfish!

13:28.041 --> 13:30.542
After that whale!

13:30.544 --> 13:33.878
I want me treasure back!

13:35.881 --> 13:39.851
- Crackers! It's gonna hurt.
- You'll be fine, Skully.

13:39.853 --> 13:42.787
But I've got to remove this
thorn so you'll feel better.

13:42.789 --> 13:44.756
Now, tell me
how you got it.

13:44.758 --> 13:47.592
Well, I found
some barberries...

13:47.594 --> 13:50.795
...and I forgot about
the thorns on their branches.

13:50.797 --> 13:54.065
But I, uh,
remembered in the end!

13:54.067 --> 13:57.602
[giggles] I hope
the berries tasted good.

13:57.604 --> 14:01.806
They were delicious,
but now it's gonna hurt.

14:01.808 --> 14:05.376
[laughs] Silly!
The thorn is already out.

14:05.378 --> 14:08.713
Amazing! I didn't
feel a thing.

14:08.715 --> 14:12.951
- [whale crying]
- Whoa! What was that?!

14:12.953 --> 14:15.987
Look! A whale!

14:19.091 --> 14:21.459
Something must be
wrong with him.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.761
Sounds like me
when I'm seasick!

14:23.763 --> 14:26.998
That's it, Cubby!
Whales don't get seasick.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.967
Something must've
given him a tummy ache.

14:28.969 --> 14:32.937
- We've got to help him.
- [moaning]

14:32.939 --> 14:36.975
But first we need
to find out why he's
having tummy troubles.

14:36.977 --> 14:39.043
Uh-oh.
We'd better get movin'.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.012
He's headin' back out to sea.

14:41.014 --> 14:45.783
Will you help us find out
why the whale has a tummy ache?

14:46.952 --> 14:50.722
Great! Remember to keep
a lookout for gold doubloons.

14:50.724 --> 14:54.125
Whenever we solve
a pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

14:54.127 --> 14:57.962
Then we'll collect 'em
and put 'em in
our Team Treasure Chest.

14:57.964 --> 15:00.031
Yo-ho, let's go!

15:03.636 --> 15:06.604
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away! </i>

15:06.606 --> 15:09.040
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

15:09.042 --> 15:10.608
<i>¶ Let's go </i>

15:10.610 --> 15:13.778
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

15:13.780 --> 15:16.681
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

15:16.683 --> 15:18.750
<i>¶ And me </i>

15:21.987 --> 15:26.491
- [moaning]
- Faster, ye swabs!

15:26.493 --> 15:29.093
I'll catch me treasure
by the tail!

15:29.095 --> 15:31.195
[Jake] Captain Hook! Stop!

15:31.197 --> 15:34.632
The whale is sick.
You shouldn't bother it.

15:35.801 --> 15:37.835
Hmm? [yelping]

15:37.837 --> 15:41.973
Oh, mind your own business,
puny pirates!

15:43.108 --> 15:45.109
[shouting]

15:46.612 --> 15:48.046
Yay-hey, no way!

15:48.048 --> 15:50.048
Now the whale
is really upset!

15:50.050 --> 15:52.784
[continues shouting]

15:52.786 --> 15:54.719
We've got to
calm him down.

15:54.721 --> 15:57.956
I know, let's try
singing a lullaby.

15:57.958 --> 16:00.591
Yeah, that always
calms me down!

16:02.161 --> 16:05.863
<i>¶ All is well</i>
<i>on the ocean waves ¶</i>

16:05.865 --> 16:09.167
<i>¶ Drift away, drift away </i>

16:09.169 --> 16:12.837
<i>¶ All your worries</i>
<i>will drift away ¶</i>

16:12.839 --> 16:16.708
¶ And glide away on the tide

16:16.710 --> 16:17.842
What's going on?

16:17.844 --> 16:22.847
Whoa, barnacles!

16:24.483 --> 16:25.883
Ouch!

16:25.885 --> 16:28.653
We did it!
We calmed down the whale.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.855
And we got three gold doubloons!

16:30.857 --> 16:34.492
Let's grab 'em and go
help the whale feel better!

16:35.694 --> 16:37.829
[whines]

16:37.831 --> 16:40.698
Mr. Whale, is it OK
if I give you a check-up

16:40.700 --> 16:42.934
to find out what's
making your tummy hurt?

16:42.936 --> 16:45.670
Mm-hm.

16:45.672 --> 16:48.172
OK, then. I need you
to open your mouth

16:48.174 --> 16:50.208
and say "Ahh."

16:50.210 --> 16:51.843
Ahh!

16:51.845 --> 16:54.278
And keep it open,
please!

16:55.180 --> 16:57.882
[gasps] Shiver me
bony bones!

16:57.884 --> 16:59.851
The sea pups are
gonna get swallowed up

16:59.853 --> 17:03.321
- by that there whale!
- What?!

17:03.323 --> 17:08.192
Those puny pirates are
going inside the beast
to get my treasure!

17:08.194 --> 17:11.562
Sharky! Bones!
Launch the dinghy!

17:11.564 --> 17:13.865
[both] Launching!

17:13.867 --> 17:14.932
[both grunt]

17:18.904 --> 17:20.705
Oh, you buffoons!

17:20.707 --> 17:23.975
I need to get out
to that whale at once.

17:23.977 --> 17:26.711
We could use your
life preserver, sir.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.280
And use it we shall!

17:29.282 --> 17:31.149
Men, you watch the ship.

17:31.151 --> 17:35.086
I want me treasure chest back,
even if Smee and I

17:35.088 --> 17:39.223
have to go inside the belly
of that beast to get it!

17:39.225 --> 17:41.826
That's right, mate...
Oh, my!

17:41.828 --> 17:45.063
Yo-ho, here we go!

17:47.166 --> 17:52.203
Ha-ha! Looks like I just
caught a boat full of guppies!

17:52.205 --> 17:55.139
- [grunts]
- What does ol'
Feather Hat want with us?

17:55.141 --> 17:57.008
I don't know. [grunts]

17:57.010 --> 18:00.645
But I'm not gonna let him
stop us from helping that whale.

18:01.380 --> 18:03.414
Whoa!

18:03.416 --> 18:07.618
Look alive, me hearties.
Into the whale we go!

18:07.620 --> 18:11.022
It's really big in here,
and kind of spooky.

18:11.024 --> 18:13.825
Don't worry, Cubby.
We're totally safe.

18:13.827 --> 18:16.294
Besides, this is the
perfect place to find out

18:16.296 --> 18:18.262
what's making
the whale's tummy ache.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.598
Maybe he ate something
he shouldn't have.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.166
A treasure chest!

18:22.168 --> 18:25.136
[Skully] No wonder the
big fella has a tummy ache!

18:25.138 --> 18:27.071
I think we should
get the treasure chest

18:27.073 --> 18:29.807
out of the whale's tummy
to help make him feel better.

18:29.809 --> 18:34.145
And I'll feel better, too.
That treasure is mine!

18:34.147 --> 18:37.315
Really?
You found treasure?

18:37.317 --> 18:40.351
It's true! The boys
pulled it up from the sea.

18:40.353 --> 18:44.355
And this ill-mannered
beast ate it!

18:44.357 --> 18:47.358
Now, out of me way!
Paddle, Smee!

18:47.360 --> 18:49.260
Paddlin', cap'n.

18:50.262 --> 18:52.096
We're in a boat,
Captain Hook.

18:52.098 --> 18:57.268
- Let us get it for you.
- And let you steal it? Never!

18:57.270 --> 18:59.904
We don't want your
treasure chest, Captain Hook.

18:59.906 --> 19:02.073
We only want to help
the whale feel better.

19:02.075 --> 19:04.375
When we get the chest,
we'll give it to you.

19:04.377 --> 19:07.712
- Pirate's honor!
- And how exactly

19:07.714 --> 19:11.249
do you plan to snare
my treasure chest?

19:11.251 --> 19:13.417
In a way that's
safe for the whale.

19:13.419 --> 19:15.419
May I borrow
your net, please?

19:15.421 --> 19:20.324
- Oh, if you insist.
- [grunts] Thanks!

19:22.127 --> 19:25.897
Now, let's toss the net
over the treasure chest.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.132
[Jake] We did it.

19:28.134 --> 19:32.336
Heave! Ho! Heave! Ho!

19:32.338 --> 19:34.205
[whale sighs]

19:34.207 --> 19:37.875
- Izzy, is that a good sign?
- It sure is, Cubby!

19:37.877 --> 19:40.044
The treasure chest
was bothering his tummy,

19:40.046 --> 19:42.980
and now that we got it out,
he's feeling better!

19:42.982 --> 19:45.449
And we got four more
gold doubloons!

19:45.451 --> 19:47.985
Let's grab 'em
and go!

19:47.987 --> 19:50.288
- [yawning]
- [Skully] Crunchy crackers!

19:50.290 --> 19:52.256
The big fella's
closing his mouth!

19:52.258 --> 19:56.127
- Row, Cubby!
- Paddle, Smee, paddle!

19:56.129 --> 19:59.363
I'm too pooped
to paddle, sir.

20:01.166 --> 20:04.468
Oh, what'll we do?
We're trapped!

20:04.470 --> 20:07.004
We gotta think
of a way out, Jake.

20:07.006 --> 20:10.274
Well, um... maybe the whale
will giggle us out

20:10.276 --> 20:12.176
if we tickle
the roof of his mouth.

20:12.178 --> 20:15.446
Good idea. But what could
we use to tickle him?

20:17.049 --> 20:20.818
Cracked crackers!
I had to go open my big beak.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.087
[giggles]

20:26.959 --> 20:29.193
[all cheering]

20:29.195 --> 20:32.363
- [shouting]
- Way to go!

20:32.365 --> 20:34.498
We got the whale to
giggle us out of his mouth!

20:34.500 --> 20:37.301
And we got two more
gold doubloons!

20:37.303 --> 20:42.173
- Let's grab 'em and go!
- You're not going anywhere.

20:42.175 --> 20:44.809
Not until you hand over
me treasure chest.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.277
But how're you gonna

20:46.279 --> 20:48.346
get it back to your ship,
Captain Hook?

20:48.348 --> 20:50.381
You let me worry about that!

20:50.383 --> 20:53.050
[grunts] To the
<i>Jolly Roger,</i> Smee!

20:53.052 --> 20:57.755
Aye-aye, cap'n. To the...
[sputtering]

20:57.757 --> 21:00.324
Poor Smee.
He'll never make it.

21:00.326 --> 21:01.959
What can we do?

21:01.961 --> 21:07.765
Well, this is an emergency,
so... pixie dust, away!

21:11.837 --> 21:13.471
Ooh!

21:13.473 --> 21:16.173
Thanks, sea pups!

21:16.842 --> 21:18.476
Happy to help!

21:18.478 --> 21:20.845
Now, Mr. Whale,
to stay healthy,

21:20.847 --> 21:22.446
get plenty of exercise,

21:22.448 --> 21:24.482
lots of rest
when you get tired,

21:24.484 --> 21:27.385
and try not to swallow
any more treasure chests.

21:27.387 --> 21:30.488
Especially if they
belong to Captain Hook!

21:33.792 --> 21:35.293
Thanks for helping us cure

21:35.295 --> 21:37.295
the whale's tummy ache
today, mateys.

21:37.297 --> 21:41.299
It's important to
treasure all of our
precious sea creatures.

21:41.301 --> 21:43.034
And speaking
of treasure,

21:43.036 --> 21:45.102
why don't we put
all our gold doubloons

21:45.104 --> 21:47.338
into our Team
Treasure Chest?

21:54.479 --> 21:56.580
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

21:56.582 --> 21:58.849
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

21:58.851 --> 22:00.851
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>with help from you ¶</i>

22:00.853 --> 22:03.654
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

22:03.656 --> 22:06.290
Come on, count with us!

22:07.526 --> 22:08.826
[all] Yeah!

22:10.028 --> 22:12.863
[Cubby] One, two, three...

22:12.865 --> 22:15.933
[Izzy] Four, five, six, seven...

22:15.935 --> 22:18.069
[Jake] Eight, nine!

22:18.071 --> 22:20.838
Yo-ho! For solving
pirate problems today,

22:20.840 --> 22:23.341
we got nine gold doubloons!

22:24.443 --> 22:27.578
Ow! Crackers!
Izzy, can you help me?

22:27.580 --> 22:29.880
Did you sit
on another thorn?

22:29.882 --> 22:33.884
Nope! But I just
made a new friend.

22:33.886 --> 22:35.953
[all laughing]

22:39.624 --> 22:44.228
Now, prepare to see
the greatest treasure

22:44.230 --> 22:46.530
ever hauled from the deep.

22:47.899 --> 22:49.967
It's gold!

22:50.569 --> 22:52.536
[sputtering]

22:52.538 --> 22:55.940
Oh, I think he
likes you, cap'n.

22:55.942 --> 22:59.443
- What will you name him?
- Codfish!
