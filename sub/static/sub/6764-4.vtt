David and Donna,
still here with you all night long.

01:37.397 --> 01:41.766
Now, call us at 555-KXCU
because we're totally interactive radio,

01:41.935 --> 01:43.527
which means you run the show.

01:43.703 --> 01:47.537
Now, that's the crucial part.
You're the show, so you call us.

01:47.707 --> 01:49.231
Now, with rush week
kicking off tomorrow

01:49.409 --> 01:51.707
I would think a lot of you out there
would have some advice

01:51.878 --> 01:53.812
on scoping out the fraternities
and sororities.

01:53.980 --> 01:55.174
But if that's not your scene,

01:55.348 --> 01:58.283
give us a call at 555-KXCU
and tell us why.

01:58.451 --> 02:00.976
Now, we have been getting some calls
from our regulars.

02:01.154 --> 02:02.280
And we thank you.

02:02.455 --> 02:05.583
Yes, but we'd like to hear
from some real listeners,

02:05.758 --> 02:10.752
so please don't call if your name
just happens to be Brandon,

02:10.930 --> 02:15.731
Brenda, Andrea, Kelly...

02:16.469 --> 02:18.334
Steve?

02:21.641 --> 02:23.836
This isn't working.
No one is calling us, David.

02:24.010 --> 02:26.945
Just give it some time.
It's only been three nights.

02:27.113 --> 02:28.603
Feels more like three years.

02:34.420 --> 02:36.615
- Let's go.
- Hey.

02:36.789 --> 02:38.450
One more time, come on.

02:38.625 --> 02:39.853
Right here, right here.

02:40.026 --> 02:42.051
Here's your pen.
You do one through three.

02:42.228 --> 02:46.289
You do four to seven.
I'll do eight, nine and ten.

02:47.934 --> 02:49.299
Score now.

02:49.469 --> 02:50.959
All right, all right.

02:51.137 --> 02:52.968
Very good. Yes, well done.

02:53.139 --> 02:54.834
You're the one.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.999
Hey, okay.
Who's next? Who's next?

02:57.177 --> 02:59.145
Okay, right here. Right here.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.741
That's a pretty strong... That's good.
You can work on it, though.

03:04.651 --> 03:05.709
Unbelievable.

03:05.885 --> 03:08.376
You know, I'm taking the five away.
That's just a six for you.

03:08.555 --> 03:10.955
Does anyone have any blush?
I look dead when I'm this tired.

03:11.124 --> 03:12.523
You do not.

03:12.692 --> 03:15.024
Donna, I can't believe
I let you talk me into sorority rush.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.254
Neither can I.
But I hope you're right about this

03:17.430 --> 03:20.160
- keeping us from drifting apart.
- You'll thank me.

03:20.333 --> 03:22.233
Suddenly I feel so underdressed.

03:22.402 --> 03:24.131
You're fine, we're all fine.

03:24.304 --> 03:26.829
Yeah, well, I hear one sweaty palm
can ruin your chances.

03:27.006 --> 03:28.064
Great. I have two.

03:28.241 --> 03:29.868
Just be grateful
you're not exhausted.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.908
Rush week, here we come.

03:33.313 --> 03:35.907
<i>We are the Gammas
The mighty, mighty Gammas</i>

03:36.082 --> 03:38.414
<i>Everywhere we go
People wanna know</i>

03:38.585 --> 03:40.849
<i>Who we are, so we tell them</i>

03:41.020 --> 03:43.318
<i>We are the Gammas
The mighty, mighty Gammas</i>

03:43.489 --> 03:45.684
<i>Everywhere we go
People wanna know</i>

03:45.858 --> 03:48.156
<i>Who we are, so we tell them</i>

03:48.328 --> 03:50.626
<i>We are the Gammas
The mighty, mighty Gammas</i>

03:50.797 --> 03:53.027
<i>Everywhere we go
People wanna know</i>

03:53.199 --> 03:55.167
<i>Who we are, so we tell them</i>

03:55.335 --> 03:58.236
<i>We are the Gammas
The mighty, mighty Gammas</i>

03:58.404 --> 04:00.099
<i>Everywhere we go
People wanna know</i>

04:00.273 --> 04:02.400
Somehow I doubt they do this
at Yale.

04:02.575 --> 04:04.372
<i>We are the Gammas
The mighty, mighty Gammas</i>

04:04.544 --> 04:05.568
Let's go.

04:05.745 --> 04:07.576
<i>Everywhere we go
People wanna know</i>

04:07.747 --> 04:08.805
<i>Who we are</i>

04:08.982 --> 04:11.883
- Hut.
- All right, all right.

04:16.389 --> 04:18.380
You're in my zone now.
When are you gonna learn?

04:18.558 --> 04:19.752
I learned. Keep talking, John.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.985
- Anything broken?
- No, I'm fine. Thanks for caring.

04:22.161 --> 04:24.721
Sorority stampede is in progress.
What do you say you give up?

04:24.897 --> 04:26.262
Come on, man,
give us one last down.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.127
One more down.

04:28.301 --> 04:31.031
- Blue deep, ready?
- Ready.

04:35.642 --> 04:36.768
Come on, Brandon. Come on.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.001
Come on.

04:38.177 --> 04:39.735
Hey.

04:50.590 --> 04:51.852
Don't rub it in, Walsh.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.652
Never forget, you're a freshman.

04:53.826 --> 04:56.522
As long as you don't forget
that a freshman just kicked your butt.

04:56.696 --> 04:57.924
It's been real, gentlemen.

04:58.097 --> 04:59.530
Stick around, man.
Watch the parade.

04:59.699 --> 05:02.395
Thanks. I've got time to hit
the showers, get to the student union.

05:02.568 --> 05:03.592
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

05:03.770 --> 05:06.500
You've got something better to do
than hang out with us KEGers?

05:06.673 --> 05:09.767
- Sue me. I have a life.
- You're breaking our hearts.

05:09.942 --> 05:11.603
- Take it easy.
- See you later. Good game.

05:11.778 --> 05:12.802
- Good job.
- All right.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.037
- Hey, Bran.
- Yeah.

05:14.213 --> 05:15.680
KEG House doesn't do
a formal rush.

05:15.848 --> 05:18.373
It's more like hanging out
with who-knows-who.

05:18.551 --> 05:21.281
If the president asks you to stick
around, you shouldn't blow him off.

05:21.454 --> 05:23.354
I'm not blowing him off.
I've got people to meet.

05:23.523 --> 05:25.821
You see that, that right there,
that's the wrong attitude.

05:25.992 --> 05:28.893
Watching sorority girls on parade
for the rest of the day is mandatory?

05:30.063 --> 05:32.395
Maybe not. But the house party
tomorrow night definitely is.

05:32.565 --> 05:34.430
Remember, this is our fraternity.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.535
Right and I told you, bro,
I will be there, so sure.

05:40.306 --> 05:42.866
Okay, this one here in the blue.

05:43.042 --> 05:44.805
Very good. Yes, well done.

05:44.977 --> 05:46.740
Definitely an eight.

05:46.913 --> 05:48.437
I'd give her more than an eight.

05:48.614 --> 05:51.139
Are you guys crazy? Trying
to get us thrown off campus or what?

05:51.317 --> 05:53.148
It's the '90s, gentlemen.

05:53.319 --> 05:56.777
Try to show a little sensitivity.

05:56.956 --> 05:58.890
Killjoy.

06:02.261 --> 06:03.523
Yo, man. I'll be right back.

06:04.731 --> 06:07.564
Come on,
we have 14 houses to see.

06:08.735 --> 06:10.862
- Hi, Kelly.
- Hi, John.

06:11.037 --> 06:14.063
- It's been a long time.
- Not long enough.

06:14.240 --> 06:17.300
I guess you're not gonna
introduce us, huh?

06:18.010 --> 06:19.978
- You know Kelly?
- Kind of.

06:20.146 --> 06:22.137
I asked her out in ninth grade.

06:22.315 --> 06:24.510
But she turned me down.

06:24.684 --> 06:28.176
- She turned you down?
- Yep. Come on.

06:31.591 --> 06:33.650
Well, this is the student senate.

06:33.826 --> 06:35.691
Does the faculty have it this good?

06:35.862 --> 06:37.727
They're just the teachers.

06:37.897 --> 06:40.422
We're the people
who really run this place.

06:40.600 --> 06:41.794
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:41.968 --> 06:43.026
I'm Angela Rhodes.

06:43.202 --> 06:45.170
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

06:45.338 --> 06:47.238
So how did you make out
with our favorite dean?

06:47.407 --> 06:48.499
The man is from Mars.

06:48.674 --> 06:49.800
It went that well, huh?

06:49.976 --> 06:51.637
We'll talk about it later.

06:52.545 --> 06:54.775
So Josh has told me a lot about you

06:54.947 --> 06:56.881
and your famous march
on the school board.

06:57.049 --> 06:58.380
I assume that's why I'm here.

06:58.551 --> 07:00.416
So you know that we have
an opening on our slate

07:00.586 --> 07:02.611
for a freshman representative
to the student senate.

07:03.356 --> 07:05.881
- Does that interest you?
- Yes, I'd be very interested in it.

07:06.058 --> 07:07.389
We were hoping you would say that.

07:07.560 --> 07:10.393
But you gotta know that a girl
passing out in her prom dress

07:10.563 --> 07:12.121
is not our kind of issue.

07:12.632 --> 07:14.259
Well, that wasn't our issue either.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.901
We had a school board
superintendent

07:16.068 --> 07:18.332
who was trying to sneak
through dress codes and rules

07:18.504 --> 07:20.529
about drinking
without any student input.

07:21.073 --> 07:24.406
There was no public debate,
no notification, no nothing.

07:24.577 --> 07:25.669
That was our issue.

07:25.845 --> 07:28.575
Better.
But I still don't know what you're about.

07:28.748 --> 07:31.046
All I know
is that you're from Beverly Hills.

07:32.885 --> 07:34.819
Well, I think you can tell
by the way I'm dressed

07:34.987 --> 07:36.978
that I'm not gonna give up shopping
on Rodeo Drive

07:37.156 --> 07:39.386
without a big floor fight, I'll tell you.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.553
Listen, guys, I just don't wanna
coast through college.

07:42.728 --> 07:44.389
This is important to me.

07:44.564 --> 07:46.657
Okay, well, thank you for your time.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.000
- That's it?
- We'll let you know.

07:50.169 --> 07:52.467
- It was nice to meet you, Brandon.
- Nice meeting you too.

07:52.638 --> 07:54.503
- See you.
- See you, man.

08:02.448 --> 08:04.848
Oh, this house is beautiful.
I could almost see myself here.

08:05.017 --> 08:06.075
Almost?

08:06.252 --> 08:07.844
It's Alpha Omega House.

08:08.020 --> 08:10.147
Their philanthropy
is Downey House for Children,

08:10.323 --> 08:13.292
their flower is fleur-de-lis
and their colors are rose and buff.

08:13.459 --> 08:15.723
Oh, I look horrible in buff.

08:16.896 --> 08:19.330
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:20.266 --> 08:21.631
Well, with 30 seconds left to go,

08:21.801 --> 08:24.702
I finally meet the fab four
from West Beverly.

08:24.871 --> 08:26.133
Someone's been talking about us?

08:26.305 --> 08:28.239
Let's see,
summer camp counselors,

08:28.407 --> 08:31.604
elementary school charities,
a Spring Queen, valedictorian.

08:31.777 --> 08:33.836
You guys could start
your own sorority.

08:35.381 --> 08:37.712
Oh, no, well,
this is why they call it rush.

08:37.884 --> 08:39.818
Excuse me.

08:40.753 --> 08:42.583
It was a sincere pleasure
to meet you.

08:42.755 --> 08:45.485
We may not see all of you again, so:

08:45.658 --> 08:48.889
<i>Hasta la vista, baby.</i>

08:49.161 --> 08:51.026
Thanks for coming.
Thanks for coming.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.789
Oh, it's perfect.

08:52.965 --> 08:55.525
Yeah, except their brother fraternity
is the KEG House.

08:55.701 --> 08:57.794
Well, that's Steve's house.
And maybe Brandon's.

08:57.970 --> 08:59.460
It's also John Sears'.

08:59.639 --> 09:02.699
Is that the guy
that you wouldn't talk to before?

09:03.409 --> 09:06.173
Kelly, come, on. Inquiring minds
would really like to know.

09:06.345 --> 09:08.506
- Kelly went out with him in ninth grade.
- Yeah.

09:08.681 --> 09:11.741
I had a huge crush on him
during my walk-all-over-me phase.

09:11.918 --> 09:15.319
- Well, who could blame you?
- He turned out to be the biggest jerk.

09:15.488 --> 09:19.891
I spent one highly regrettable night
with him and his parents' champagne.

09:20.059 --> 09:21.856
The next day he told every senior
he knew.

09:22.028 --> 09:23.325
And he made up stuff too.

09:23.496 --> 09:25.794
He has a fertile imagination.

09:25.965 --> 09:26.989
If he opens his big mouth,

09:27.166 --> 09:30.329
I will have doors slamming in my face
all up and down sorority row.

09:30.970 --> 09:32.631
Kelly, any sorority
would love to have you.

09:33.105 --> 09:34.732
Don't count on it.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.966
A bad rep is the kiss of death.

09:37.143 --> 09:38.371
Even past tense.

09:39.378 --> 09:41.107
Come on.

09:42.214 --> 09:44.705
Yeah, well, I can't talk right now.
I'm in the dorm.

09:44.884 --> 09:45.908
Hi.

09:46.085 --> 09:49.384
Well, this is an Andrea Zuckerman
I haven't seen before.

09:49.555 --> 09:52.752
Why, thank you, Mr. Dan Rubin.
I should be thanking you, right?

09:52.925 --> 09:54.756
Absolutely. You look great.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.758
- What's the occasion?
- I'm rushing.

09:56.929 --> 09:59.090
As in rushing?

09:59.265 --> 10:00.562
Surprise, surprise.

10:00.733 --> 10:02.428
Which one of the houses
do you like best?

10:02.969 --> 10:06.666
Well, my friends and I
like Alpha Omega the best.

10:06.839 --> 10:08.136
Really?

10:08.307 --> 10:12.505
I would have thought you'd be
zeroing in on the Jewish sororities.

10:13.579 --> 10:17.345
Oh, and if I was Asian,
I should only look at Asian sororities.

10:17.516 --> 10:18.710
If I was African American,

10:18.884 --> 10:21.375
I should only look
at African American sororities.

10:21.554 --> 10:23.351
Some kind
of resident adviser you are.

10:23.522 --> 10:25.513
I didn't invent the system.

10:25.691 --> 10:29.650
But I bet in the end,
you'll find yourself in a Jewish sorority.

10:31.931 --> 10:33.558
Are you saying
that there's anti-Semitism?

10:33.733 --> 10:37.169
No, just birds of a feather
flocking together.

10:38.938 --> 10:40.599
You know what I think?

10:40.773 --> 10:42.798
The minute someone
shows a little enthusiasm,

10:42.975 --> 10:45.034
the cynics of the world get nervous.

10:48.047 --> 10:50.515
Have a nice day, counselor.

10:59.692 --> 11:02.058
- Hey, stranger.
- Hey.

11:02.228 --> 11:03.422
Where are you hiding yourself?

11:03.596 --> 11:06.360
Oh, over at sorority row, watching
everybody out-smile each other.

11:06.532 --> 11:09.126
Yeah, Kelly's been telling me
a lot about it. So please spare me.

11:09.301 --> 11:11.599
I don't believe my luck.
This is the second school in a row

11:11.771 --> 11:13.762
- that I didn't get the classes I wanted.
- Really?

11:13.939 --> 11:17.306
I got everything. English 135B.
I'm in this class too.

11:17.476 --> 11:19.205
Poetry of the Young Romantics.

11:19.378 --> 11:20.743
You are?

11:20.913 --> 11:22.676
Every Monday, Wednesday, Friday.
Lindley Hall.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.679
Well, great.
You can help me with my homework.

11:24.850 --> 11:27.580
- You wanna get some coffee?
- No, I'm sorry.

11:27.753 --> 11:30.586
I've got to go meet the girls
for a rush-week recap.

11:31.090 --> 11:32.557
Are you really into that?

11:33.559 --> 11:35.550
I'm trying.

11:42.635 --> 11:44.364
Thanks, guys.

11:45.171 --> 11:46.934
- Hey there, Mr. Walsh.
- Yeah.

11:47.106 --> 11:49.939
We were just about to call your house.
Congratulations, Mr. Senator.

11:50.109 --> 11:51.804
Well, thank you.
You guys were a tough room.

11:51.977 --> 11:53.569
Well, now
we have to get you elected.

11:53.746 --> 11:56.510
- So we should talk strategy.
- And finalize the party platform.

11:56.982 --> 11:59.075
- Great, I'll be there.
- You're gonna be very busy.

11:59.251 --> 12:00.741
I was hoping you'd say that.

12:02.488 --> 12:04.547
Hey, Steve. John.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.625
- Bran.
- Sanders, come on.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.260
They must still be mad
since I trounced them

12:14.433 --> 12:15.798
in the football game today.

12:15.968 --> 12:17.492
How do you know those guys?

12:17.670 --> 12:20.798
Steve, the blond one,
is a buddy of mine from high school.

12:21.273 --> 12:23.468
- High school buddies, huh?
- Yeah.

12:23.642 --> 12:25.542
Well, you're not in high school
anymore, Brandon.

12:27.980 --> 12:31.211
- Yeah, so we'll catch up with you.
- Right.

12:38.457 --> 12:41.517
Walsh. Party for four, over there.

12:41.694 --> 12:44.219
- I'm so pleased you could join us.
- I know I'm late, I'm sorry.

12:44.396 --> 12:45.920
- Really late.
- Really, really late.

12:46.098 --> 12:48.123
I'm really, really sorry,
but I don't understand

12:48.300 --> 12:51.098
why we have to open up the first round
of sorority invitations together.

12:51.504 --> 12:52.994
All for one and one for all.

12:53.572 --> 12:56.063
Come on, let's do it so I can grab
a nap before the radio show.

12:56.242 --> 12:59.040
I'm so nervous. How can they make
cuts based on meeting us once?

12:59.545 --> 13:03.242
Just relax. Okay, ready, all together.

13:04.683 --> 13:05.980
- Alpha.
- Alpha.

13:06.152 --> 13:08.313
- Alpha.
- Alpha.

13:08.487 --> 13:10.182
Yes. We are on our way.

13:10.356 --> 13:12.153
Now, I remember why I did this
with you guys.

13:12.992 --> 13:14.983
We made it through the first cut,
but pace yourself,

13:15.161 --> 13:16.992
there are two more rounds to go.

13:17.463 --> 13:18.896
Two more rounds?

13:19.632 --> 13:20.997
My son, the senator.

13:21.167 --> 13:23.601
The next Jack Kennedy, right here.

13:23.769 --> 13:26.363
Dad, I said student senate,
did you hear me say "student"?

13:26.539 --> 13:27.733
You heard me, didn't you, Mom?

13:27.907 --> 13:30.808
But a lot of very important people
got started just this way.

13:30.976 --> 13:34.810
How do you think future presidents
of the United States learn the ropes?

13:34.980 --> 13:36.447
Would you tell him to get a grip,
Mom?

13:37.149 --> 13:38.844
- Get a grip.
- Get a grip, Dad.

13:39.018 --> 13:40.986
- Hey, hey.
- Hey.

13:41.153 --> 13:42.848
Did you hear what happened
to your brother?

13:43.022 --> 13:44.319
Yes, and I'm hoping it will lead

13:44.490 --> 13:46.617
to a better parking spot on campus
for his sister.

13:46.792 --> 13:49.625
Don't worry, my sister,
I will not forget the little people.

13:49.795 --> 13:52.821
There you go. Now,
you're talking like a politician, son.

13:53.799 --> 13:55.630
So, what does this Progressive Party
stand for?

13:56.468 --> 13:57.492
Good stuff.

13:57.670 --> 14:02.107
You know, they take a hard line
on racism, elitism, chauvinism, sexism.

14:02.274 --> 14:03.571
Your basic isms.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.806
The politically-correct crowd.

14:05.978 --> 14:07.570
Call it what you will.

14:07.746 --> 14:09.441
What are they gonna think
about you partying

14:09.615 --> 14:11.845
till you drop at the KEG House?

14:12.017 --> 14:13.279
KEG's progressive.

14:13.452 --> 14:16.080
Oh, right,
they recycle their beer bottles.

14:16.255 --> 14:18.917
That's right,
and I'm sure it will be just fine.

14:19.425 --> 14:20.449
Well, you're lucky.

14:20.626 --> 14:23.288
When we were in college,
things got kind of polarized.

14:23.462 --> 14:24.622
Well, that's for sure.

14:24.797 --> 14:27.459
Somehow the way people felt
about fraternities and sororities

14:27.633 --> 14:30.625
got all tangled up with how they felt
about the Vietnam War.

14:30.803 --> 14:32.270
Yeah, it wasn't always friendly.

14:32.438 --> 14:34.497
The Greeks were perceived
to be pretty conservative.

14:35.307 --> 14:37.468
Well, I wouldn't worry about it, guys.

14:38.143 --> 14:41.840
And in case you haven't heard,
the war's over.

14:43.816 --> 14:45.044
<i>Hello, Los Angeles.</i>

14:45.217 --> 14:47.082
<i>It's 2:00 in the morning
and you've guessed it,</i>

14:47.253 --> 14:48.982
this is David and Donna,
with you till dawn.

14:49.154 --> 14:51.315
- And we're totally interactive radio.
- No, no, no.

14:51.490 --> 14:52.684
We're not totally interactive.

14:52.858 --> 14:55.793
We're not totally interactive at all.
What we are is exhausted.

14:57.696 --> 14:59.823
Put on some music, okay?

15:00.299 --> 15:01.425
Well, what do you wanna hear?

15:03.102 --> 15:06.594
Obviously,
whatever's in the CD player.

15:07.873 --> 15:09.898
Oh, there's nothing in the CD player.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.370
Donna, there's nothing
in the CD player

15:12.544 --> 15:14.603
because you forgot
to load up the CD player.

15:14.780 --> 15:17.510
Now, I think our audience
deserves better than that.

15:18.550 --> 15:19.574
"Audience," David.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.879
What audience?
There's no one out there.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.319
That's because
you're screaming at them.

15:26.859 --> 15:28.554
What are you cueing up?

15:28.727 --> 15:31.321
Whatever's on the turntable.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.933
Problems, kids.

15:44.710 --> 15:45.734
Pronto.

15:45.911 --> 15:48.436
Brandon, it's me. I'm downstairs.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.481
<i>- Downstairs where?
- Downstairs of your house.</i>

15:51.650 --> 15:52.810
I saw your light on.

15:52.985 --> 15:55.044
I don't wanna wake everybody
by ringing the doorbell.

15:55.254 --> 15:56.585
And what about the phone, Steve?

15:56.755 --> 15:59.485
Isn't it possible that a ringing phone
could wake someone?

15:59.658 --> 16:02.718
Just get your butt down here
and spare me the lecture, okay?

16:03.963 --> 16:05.794
And to what do I owe
this unexpected pleasure?

16:05.965 --> 16:07.728
I couldn't sleep.
It's probably nothing, but...

16:07.900 --> 16:09.197
Of course.

16:09.368 --> 16:12.496
That's why you came all the way
over here in the middle of the night.

16:12.671 --> 16:15.538
- You're coming to that party, right?
- I told you I'd be there, yeah.

16:15.708 --> 16:19.007
KEG House rush is that party.
So be on your best behavior.

16:19.178 --> 16:21.408
Did you come all the way over here
just to tell me that?

16:21.580 --> 16:25.607
No, I couldn't help thinking
about what John Sears said.

16:25.784 --> 16:28.150
What are you doing hanging out
with those political guys?

16:28.320 --> 16:30.481
Because they're running me
for student senate.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.284
Oh, great. The KEG House
is gonna flip over that.

16:33.459 --> 16:36.553
Steve, I thought maybe you'd at least
feign a little excitement for me.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.492
Don't expect me to be too stoked.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.188
Those guys have it in for Greek life.

16:40.366 --> 16:42.266
I don't think they even care
about Greek life.

16:43.235 --> 16:46.636
All I know is the KEG crew
hates their guts. Okay?

16:46.805 --> 16:49.865
Sears doesn't even allow the pledges
to hang out with those weasels.

16:50.042 --> 16:51.907
- I really don't care.
- I thought we were gonna

16:52.077 --> 16:53.840
- stick together.
- We are.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.209
I've got this bad feeling,
like joining this fraternity

16:57.383 --> 16:58.645
is gonna cost me my best friend.

16:58.817 --> 17:01.911
- Come on, man, you're being stupid.
- You gotta make a choice, Brandon.

17:02.087 --> 17:05.113
Not at 2:00 in the morning, I don't.

17:05.290 --> 17:06.621
Relax. I'll be at the party.

17:06.791 --> 17:08.521
Now, go home and get some sleep,
all right?

17:09.361 --> 17:11.295
Don't say I didn't warn you.

17:21.707 --> 17:24.869
Have you ever seen
so many perfect-looking people?

17:25.044 --> 17:26.875
What planet are we on?

17:27.046 --> 17:31.380
Okay, ladies, on the count of three,
mingle and impress.

17:33.218 --> 17:37.712
So are you narrowing
your choices down?

17:37.890 --> 17:41.121
Well, I really love the feel
of this place.

17:41.293 --> 17:42.317
Thanks.

17:42.494 --> 17:45.088
I know this is gonna sound
too good to be true,

17:45.264 --> 17:47.596
but we really are a family here.

17:47.766 --> 17:52.260
And we're looking for people
who might fit in.

17:52.438 --> 17:53.564
Pretty big family.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.707
Yeah, tell me about it,
I'm an only child.

17:56.241 --> 17:57.265
So am I.

17:57.443 --> 17:58.967
Well, that's not all we have
in common.

17:59.144 --> 18:02.443
I was the editor
of my high school newspaper too.

18:02.981 --> 18:05.381
Did you try out for the paper here
when you were a freshman?

18:05.551 --> 18:08.748
Yeah. Yeah, I did until they asked me
to review a friend's play.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.655
I had to review a friend's restaurant.

18:11.824 --> 18:14.622
I wish I had met you last week.
I could have used your advice.

18:14.793 --> 18:16.624
You want some advice?

18:16.795 --> 18:17.921
Think Alpha House.

18:18.497 --> 18:19.896
Come on, I'll show you around.

18:34.012 --> 18:36.913
- Can that be any louder?
- It's metal and rap. Do you like it?

18:38.717 --> 18:39.741
No.

18:39.918 --> 18:41.112
I'm trying to sleep.

18:41.653 --> 18:44.349
The sorority is having a '70s party
at the KEG House tonight

18:44.523 --> 18:46.491
and I'm exhausted.

18:46.658 --> 18:49.218
Well, who said you had to rush
a sorority in the first place?

18:50.929 --> 18:55.161
I heard that, David.
It wasn't very nice.

18:55.334 --> 18:57.928
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Come here.

18:58.904 --> 19:01.065
I'm sorry.

19:01.240 --> 19:04.004
I've gotta take a nap.

19:04.176 --> 19:08.476
Yeah, well, I know
what I wanna do right now.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.046
So do I.

19:10.215 --> 19:12.376
Sleep.

19:18.924 --> 19:20.721
Okay.

19:21.393 --> 19:23.657
It is a theme party
at Steve's fraternity.

19:23.829 --> 19:24.955
Yeah, what's the theme?

19:25.130 --> 19:27.291
One of the great ones,
you know, man versus nature?

19:27.466 --> 19:29.024
Appearance versus reality?

19:30.435 --> 19:32.062
Disco Fever.

19:32.237 --> 19:34.933
I'll tell you what, I missed Disco Fever
the first time around, Kel.

19:35.107 --> 19:36.574
What makes you think
I wanna catch it?

19:36.742 --> 19:37.766
For me?

19:37.943 --> 19:41.743
Can't you just break your little
no-frat rule just this once, please?

19:41.914 --> 19:44.007
Listen, I thought we agreed
we'd go our separate ways

19:44.183 --> 19:45.673
on this party-hardy stuff.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.614
Fine. Forget I ever asked you.

19:48.754 --> 19:52.622
- Do you hate me?
- Yes, I hate you.

19:52.791 --> 19:53.917
But I love you more.

19:54.626 --> 19:57.618
Good. I'll talk to you later.

19:57.796 --> 19:58.888
Okay.

19:59.064 --> 20:00.292
Goodbye.

20:00.465 --> 20:01.489
Bye.

20:14.079 --> 20:16.206
God, I love college.

20:16.381 --> 20:17.973
Classes haven't even started yet.

20:18.150 --> 20:19.981
- Classes?
- This is the best. It's the best.

20:20.152 --> 20:21.915
Do me a favor
and tell Brandon that, okay?

20:22.087 --> 20:25.181
- Would you like to dance?
- The best.

20:25.357 --> 20:26.381
Donna, wake up.

20:26.558 --> 20:30.255
Oh, we've gotta keep moving
or I'm gonna crash, come on.

20:31.663 --> 20:34.359
Yeah, she's rushing Alpha House.

20:37.035 --> 20:39.936
Hey, are John and Leslie tight?

20:42.307 --> 20:44.172
John and everybody are tight.

20:44.343 --> 20:47.540
Hey, you knew him at West Beverly,
right?

20:47.713 --> 20:50.238
- Why? Did he say I did?
- He remembers you fondly.

20:51.383 --> 20:53.476
Give me the gory details.
What exactly did he say?

20:53.652 --> 20:57.349
He said he had a thing for you,
but you weren't interested.

20:59.391 --> 21:01.518
I love this song.

21:44.436 --> 21:46.529
Oh, Brandon,
why am I not having any fun?

21:46.705 --> 21:49.902
Well, for starters, Bren, you're not
wearing your platform shoes.

21:50.075 --> 21:52.270
Well, if that would help, I would.
Believe me,

21:52.444 --> 21:53.968
I mean, usually, I have fun at parties.

21:54.146 --> 21:57.013
This isn't a party, Bren,
this is a way of life.

21:57.182 --> 22:00.174
You know, I like the idea of all of us
having something together,

22:00.352 --> 22:02.081
but I guess I'm just not a joiner.

22:02.254 --> 22:03.949
Substitute the word fraternity
for sorority,

22:04.122 --> 22:06.955
you've just described what's going on
between me and Steve.

22:07.125 --> 22:08.922
Could it be that we're related?

22:09.094 --> 22:12.086
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Hey, Mr. KEG Man.

22:12.664 --> 22:14.825
So are you and your girlfriend
up to a little nine-ball?

22:16.568 --> 22:19.128
I'm not his girlfriend. I'm his sister.

22:19.304 --> 22:21.169
And thanks for the offer,
but, no, I'm leaving.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.739
- Bye, babe.
- Bye, Bren.

22:23.275 --> 22:25.402
Your sister is cute.

22:25.577 --> 22:27.408
Is she available?

22:27.579 --> 22:30.810
Don't even think about it, man.
Get out of here.

22:32.918 --> 22:35.853
John is an incredible guy.
I didn't realize you knew him.

22:36.388 --> 22:39.516
Actually, I haven't said a word to John
in over three years.

22:39.691 --> 22:42.626
Well, looks like you might be able
to make up for lost time.

22:42.794 --> 22:44.955
- Now is your chance.
- Hi.

22:45.130 --> 22:46.188
Hi.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.830
Let's go dance.

22:51.036 --> 22:53.197
So you having a good time?

22:53.672 --> 22:55.367
Yeah, everybody is.

22:55.540 --> 22:57.269
Wow, you look dazzling.

22:57.442 --> 22:59.410
Must be the polyester.

22:59.578 --> 23:01.910
I'm really glad you made it.
A bit surprised too, actually.

23:02.080 --> 23:04.344
I was afraid
you weren't gonna show up.

23:04.916 --> 23:05.940
I don't get it.

23:06.118 --> 23:08.678
Aren't you the same guy
who spent a year trying to ruin my life?

23:08.854 --> 23:11.789
No, I'm not that guy anymore.

23:11.957 --> 23:13.447
Do you wanna go outside?
It's quieter.

23:27.005 --> 23:29.371
I owe you a big apology.

23:29.541 --> 23:31.566
Yeah, you do.

23:32.778 --> 23:35.747
I've really tried to grow up
since then, Kelly.

23:36.581 --> 23:38.014
Have you had any success?

23:38.950 --> 23:40.577
You could find out for yourself.

23:40.752 --> 23:43.277
You've changed a lot.
Maybe I have too.

23:44.089 --> 23:47.616
Kelly? We're about to take off.

23:48.527 --> 23:50.119
Donna, this is John Sears.

23:50.295 --> 23:52.229
- This is my roommate, Donna.
- Hi.

23:53.165 --> 23:56.362
I know who he is.
Well, we better get going.

23:57.869 --> 23:59.564
Actually, I think
I'm gonna stick around.

24:01.072 --> 24:02.903
John and I
have some catching up to do.

24:04.209 --> 24:06.643
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

24:08.580 --> 24:12.243
Okay. Well, there's always 911.

24:15.287 --> 24:16.618
I can guess what that was about.

24:17.255 --> 24:18.779
She has a good memory.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.986
Fair enough.

24:22.127 --> 24:23.992
You wanna dance?

24:24.496 --> 24:26.157
Sure.

24:36.608 --> 24:38.269
So you always dress
like Donny Osmond, man?

24:38.877 --> 24:42.313
Only when the frat throws
a Disco Fever party.

24:43.381 --> 24:45.008
How did a comedy genius
like yourself,

24:45.183 --> 24:47.048
ever become the president
of Animal House?

24:47.219 --> 24:50.882
Well, I look good in a jacket and tie,
promising the disciplinary committee,

24:51.056 --> 24:52.580
"It will never ever happen again, sir. "

24:54.192 --> 24:55.523
I've done enough of that myself.

24:55.927 --> 24:58.088
Two Boy Scouts.

24:58.730 --> 25:01.096
- You know where Oroville is?
- No, I don't think so.

25:01.266 --> 25:04.201
In the mountains,
north of Sacramento.

25:04.369 --> 25:06.132
We have two attractions:

25:06.705 --> 25:10.869
The ice breaking on Oro Lake
in the spring

25:11.042 --> 25:12.373
and high school sports.

25:12.944 --> 25:16.471
Ten kids from Oro made it to college
my senior year.

25:16.648 --> 25:18.639
I came here to play football.

25:18.817 --> 25:19.943
So why aren't you playing?

25:20.118 --> 25:23.519
Tore up my shoulder halfway
through the sophomore season.

25:24.322 --> 25:26.017
The second the doctors gave up,

25:26.191 --> 25:30.150
the coaches, players
and cheerleaders, they all disappeared.

25:30.328 --> 25:31.522
But my fraternity brothers...

25:31.696 --> 25:33.425
They made you president.

25:33.598 --> 25:35.031
The best people in this whole school

25:35.200 --> 25:37.964
are right here
at Kappa Epsilon Gamma,

25:38.136 --> 25:39.569
including Steve Sanders.

25:39.738 --> 25:43.504
Well, he's no model citizen,
but he is a good friend, man.

25:43.675 --> 25:46.109
You know,
he talks about you all the time.

25:46.278 --> 25:49.509
- He thinks of you as a brother.
- I feel the same way about him.

25:49.681 --> 25:51.911
He also says you might be running
for student senate.

25:52.083 --> 25:55.143
Yeah, for the Progressives.

25:58.256 --> 25:59.621
What do you think about that?

26:00.859 --> 26:03.327
Well, I think that nobody here
is trying to pressure you

26:03.495 --> 26:06.760
into anything one way or the other.

26:06.932 --> 26:09.560
But you can't have both, Brandon.

26:10.502 --> 26:14.461
And I hope you appreciate
what you might be passing up.

26:20.345 --> 26:22.540
I can't believe that
you have one of these every week.

26:22.714 --> 26:23.976
Friday nights at the KEG House.

26:24.149 --> 26:26.515
It's the one thing around here
that you can count on.

26:26.685 --> 26:29.176
And one of the advantages
to being an Alpha.

26:29.354 --> 26:31.549
And there seems to be
the right mix of...

26:31.723 --> 26:33.418
Cute guys?

26:33.592 --> 26:35.059
Yeah, that's right.

26:35.226 --> 26:38.559
I should warn you that you're not
gonna find a lot of Jewish guys here.

26:38.730 --> 26:40.027
Is that a problem?

26:40.198 --> 26:42.928
- Why would it be?
- No reason.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.966
Oh, there's the head
of the Inter-Greek Council.

26:45.136 --> 26:48.264
I've got to go catch her
before she leaves.

26:57.782 --> 27:00.046
Hey, I see somebody bailed
from the party early.

27:00.218 --> 27:01.845
Did you have a good time?

27:02.020 --> 27:04.147
I OD'd. Over-discoed.

27:04.322 --> 27:05.380
Yeah.

27:05.557 --> 27:08.651
- Was Kelly having a good time?
- Yeah, everybody was.

27:08.827 --> 27:10.920
Not everybody,
because you're sitting here.

27:11.096 --> 27:13.326
Hey, you weren't even brave enough
to give it a try.

27:13.498 --> 27:14.988
I just wasn't that stupid, Bren.

27:16.635 --> 27:19.433
I just thought that if there was anything
Kelly, Donna and Andrea

27:19.604 --> 27:21.697
and I could do together,
it would be join a sorority.

27:21.873 --> 27:24.433
- But I just can't.
- So don't.

27:26.244 --> 27:28.508
I guess I'm afraid
that I'm gonna lose my friends.

27:30.515 --> 27:31.846
Well, to tell you the truth, Bren,

27:32.017 --> 27:34.850
I couldn't really see myself
with the sorority-girl type either.

27:35.286 --> 27:38.653
But Kelly seems to enjoy it,
it's probably harmless.

27:41.726 --> 27:43.591
I mean it, really, it's fine.

27:44.329 --> 27:47.264
So, what are you saying, I should
just join the sorority with the others?

27:47.432 --> 27:50.731
No, I'm saying that you should do
what is right for you

27:50.902 --> 27:52.836
and the rest of it
will take care of itself.

27:59.944 --> 28:01.309
This is David and Donna.

28:01.479 --> 28:03.174
All by ourselves.

28:03.348 --> 28:04.372
Give us a call.

28:04.883 --> 28:05.975
We're waiting.

28:06.151 --> 28:09.052
Oh, please. No one's gonna call.

28:09.220 --> 28:10.448
See? Look.

28:10.622 --> 28:14.388
No calls, nothing, zippo,
less than zippo.

28:14.559 --> 28:17.494
I mean, what do guys know
about waiting for someone to call?

28:18.329 --> 28:20.126
You're losing it.

28:20.999 --> 28:22.466
Oh, sure, you would think so.

28:22.634 --> 28:23.726
But all you girls out there,

28:23.902 --> 28:25.836
you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

28:26.004 --> 28:28.734
I mean, you can sit and wait forever
for a guy to call you

28:28.907 --> 28:31.034
but then when he wants you,
he's all over you.

28:31.209 --> 28:34.736
Like David here. This afternoon,
he couldn't leave me alone, could you?

28:36.381 --> 28:38.645
I was happy to see you.

28:39.317 --> 28:41.979
Well, gals,
here's a little riddle for you:

28:42.153 --> 28:43.916
What starts pawing you
the second you get home

28:44.089 --> 28:46.216
because they're happy to see you?

28:46.391 --> 28:47.585
You give up?

28:49.527 --> 28:51.154
D- O-G. Dog.

28:52.464 --> 28:53.988
Are you calling me a dog?

28:54.165 --> 28:57.760
Honey, if the fur fits, wear it.

29:00.538 --> 29:03.439
- Cool bit, huh?
- Yeah.

29:03.608 --> 29:05.200
Yeah, you're a major talent.

29:06.044 --> 29:09.104
It's a real honor
to share a booth with you.

29:10.415 --> 29:12.747
<i>David, don't be mad at me,
I thought the dog bit was funny.</i>

29:12.917 --> 29:14.077
<i>Donna, your mike is on.</i>

29:14.252 --> 29:17.449
I can't believe
you actually know these two.

29:17.622 --> 29:21.786
Donna hasn't slept all week.
She's usually not that bad.

29:21.960 --> 29:24.155
- Or maybe she is.
- Yeah, she's pretty wacky.

29:24.329 --> 29:25.762
You don't have to live with them.

29:25.930 --> 29:29.661
I'd trade places with them in a minute
to be closer to you.

29:32.036 --> 29:35.528
What kind of line is that?
You haven't changed at all.

29:43.014 --> 29:44.504
John, I have a boyfriend.

29:44.682 --> 29:46.274
Well, where is he?

29:46.451 --> 29:48.942
Because if you were my girlfriend
I'd be with you at every party

29:49.120 --> 29:51.918
just to keep guys like me
from crawling all over you.

29:52.090 --> 29:54.422
Well, Dylan's not that big on parties.

29:54.592 --> 29:56.685
Maybe Dylan's not that big on you.

29:58.429 --> 30:01.023
He is.
You don't know anything about him.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.495
I better go.

30:04.035 --> 30:05.161
Can I call you?

30:06.838 --> 30:11.275
It's been really good to see you again,
but I'd rather you didn't.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.670
I might anyway.

30:30.528 --> 30:32.359
Surprise. Surprise.

30:32.530 --> 30:34.327
Is something wrong?

30:34.499 --> 30:38.026
The party was over and I didn't have
anybody to go home with.

30:38.970 --> 30:42.770
Well, you're home now.

30:43.975 --> 30:46.034
I missed you.

30:47.245 --> 30:49.338
I missed you too.

30:52.217 --> 30:55.186
Dylan, I was wondering something.

30:55.820 --> 30:57.344
What?

30:59.123 --> 31:02.024
Why can't you be more
like everybody else?

31:07.298 --> 31:09.664
Is that really what you want?

31:12.170 --> 31:15.367
No. Not really.

31:16.107 --> 31:18.371
I didn't think so.

31:30.121 --> 31:33.613
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- I'm sure no one was even listening.

31:33.791 --> 31:37.192
- Yeah, except our closest friends.
- David.

31:37.362 --> 31:40.058
- Thanks, guys.
- What are friends for?

31:40.231 --> 31:42.131
- Come on, admit it, bro.
- All right, all right.

31:42.300 --> 31:44.393
The brothers know how to party.
You happy now?

31:44.569 --> 31:45.593
I'm getting there.

31:45.770 --> 31:47.863
Well, I like that Charlie Dixon.
He's a classy guy.

31:48.039 --> 31:49.631
The whole fraternity is classy,
Brandon.

31:49.807 --> 31:51.536
And from what my sources tell me,

31:51.709 --> 31:53.700
to pledge, all we have to do
is show up on Saturday.

31:53.878 --> 31:55.869
Brandon, you got the word
on the meeting tonight?

31:56.047 --> 31:57.742
Yeah, 8:00 sharp.
Student Senate Room.

31:57.916 --> 32:00.407
Right. We'll be going over
the fine print in the platform,

32:00.585 --> 32:01.984
so be ready for a long night.

32:02.153 --> 32:04.212
Cool.
Steve Sanders, Josh Richland.

32:04.389 --> 32:05.515
- Josh, Steve.
- Hello.

32:05.690 --> 32:06.884
- A pleasure.
- Yeah, right.

32:07.892 --> 32:10.622
There's some other stuff we should
talk about, but we can do it later.

32:11.095 --> 32:12.687
Sure.

32:13.798 --> 32:14.924
Finalize the fine print.

32:15.099 --> 32:16.589
Now, that sounds like a party, man.

32:16.768 --> 32:19.669
There is just no way a fraternity
can compete with that.

32:19.837 --> 32:20.861
Yeah, right.

32:21.039 --> 32:22.700
It's not like my being Jewish
is a secret.

32:22.874 --> 32:25.240
I mean, how many Zuckermans
have you met who aren't Jewish?

32:25.410 --> 32:26.434
Told you so.

32:26.611 --> 32:28.806
See, but maybe
she didn't mean anything by it.

32:28.980 --> 32:30.277
Maybe.

32:30.448 --> 32:31.938
Could be there's a bounty
for the Alpha

32:32.116 --> 32:34.050
that bags the most Jewish girls.

32:34.218 --> 32:37.551
Yeah, but then why would she care
if I dated only Jewish guys?

32:37.722 --> 32:40.020
Do you only date Jewish guys?

32:40.191 --> 32:42.284
After this, maybe I will.

32:42.460 --> 32:44.189
Good. Then I have a chance.

32:44.362 --> 32:46.489
Dan, please.

32:46.664 --> 32:49.724
No, really, I'm trying to understand
what happened.

32:49.901 --> 32:51.129
I mean, she gave me this pitch

32:51.302 --> 32:52.792
that was supposed to be
one big family.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.701
- Everyone's supposed to fit in.
- That's the basic Greek attitude.

32:55.873 --> 32:57.932
Yeah, but I thought she meant
that I'd fit in.

32:58.109 --> 33:01.044
This could be her way of asking
if being Jewish is something

33:01.212 --> 33:02.736
you're willing to check at the door.

33:04.849 --> 33:08.046
Well, if that's the question,
I know how to get an answer.

33:15.326 --> 33:17.317
Shouldn't we at least consider
how we're gonna pay

33:17.495 --> 33:19.486
for all the additional security
we're demanding?

33:19.664 --> 33:21.188
No, we shouldn't.

33:21.366 --> 33:22.993
- Are you done?
- Almost.

33:23.167 --> 33:25.658
What I'm really concerned with
is Priority 9.

33:25.837 --> 33:28.533
The removal of all Panhellenic
sororities and fraternities

33:28.706 --> 33:30.105
from the university campus.

33:30.274 --> 33:34.677
What? You think it should read
"all fraternity and sorority types"?

33:34.846 --> 33:38.475
Look, we know it's ambitious,
but this could be a real rallying point.

33:38.649 --> 33:41.209
Wait a minute, 90 percent
of the incoming freshmen

33:41.386 --> 33:42.819
couldn't get the classes
they needed.

33:42.987 --> 33:45.387
The library closes early
four days a week.

33:45.556 --> 33:48.116
How can one of our priorities
be to bash other students?

33:48.292 --> 33:50.157
You know how much
of your student activities fee

33:50.328 --> 33:52.796
goes to floats
and candlelight ceremonies?

33:52.964 --> 33:55.933
And that money can go
to the Chicano Cultural Project

33:56.100 --> 33:57.658
or to daycare for single mothers.

33:58.302 --> 34:00.532
Okay, wait, let me make it simple.

34:00.705 --> 34:02.969
The Greeks are elitist
and they're racist.

34:03.141 --> 34:05.803
If you have some thoughts on how
to get rid of them, we're all ears.

34:05.977 --> 34:08.103
Let's hold on a second.

34:08.279 --> 34:11.248
Some of my best friends
are pledging sororities and fraternities

34:11.416 --> 34:14.748
at this very moment,
and they are neither elitist nor racist.

34:14.918 --> 34:15.943
Greeks are more inclusive

34:16.120 --> 34:18.213
than half the groups
you want to increase funding for.

34:18.389 --> 34:20.118
Are you gonna hold us up
on every issue?

34:20.291 --> 34:22.782
There's a lot more I disagree with
if that's what you're asking.

34:22.960 --> 34:24.518
You're being a pain.
We're moving on.

34:24.695 --> 34:26.993
- I'm not finished.
- Yes, you are.

34:31.002 --> 34:33.994
Well, I can't run this platform,
ladies and gentlemen.

34:34.172 --> 34:36.902
Find yourself
another fair-haired boy.

34:47.018 --> 34:48.542
Hi, Andrea.

34:48.719 --> 34:49.879
What are you doing here?

34:50.054 --> 34:51.543
Can I come in?

34:51.722 --> 34:53.417
Sure.

34:53.925 --> 34:56.359
The candlelight ceremony
was really moving.

34:56.527 --> 34:59.018
I loved it.

34:59.197 --> 35:01.028
What got into you, huh?

35:01.199 --> 35:02.689
What'd you have to wear
the star for?

35:03.634 --> 35:04.828
I pulled for you all week long.

35:05.002 --> 35:07.095
The girls were all ready
to accept you.

35:07.638 --> 35:09.196
But not if I'm Jewish.

35:10.007 --> 35:11.599
Are you crazy?

35:11.776 --> 35:13.243
I'm Jewish.

35:15.713 --> 35:16.941
I had no idea.

35:17.615 --> 35:19.310
Yeah, well,
everybody in the sorority knows.

35:19.484 --> 35:21.543
And everybody is fine with it.

35:22.487 --> 35:24.421
- They are?
- Of course.

35:24.589 --> 35:26.454
Because I don't flaunt it.
That's the trick.

35:28.359 --> 35:30.953
So there's a trick.

35:32.763 --> 35:34.458
You've got a real problem,
you know that.

35:36.367 --> 35:38.232
I have a problem?

35:39.270 --> 35:41.204
When you go to synagogue
on the High Holy Days,

35:41.372 --> 35:43.567
what do you tell
your sorority sisters?

35:43.741 --> 35:45.072
That you're off to the mall?

35:45.243 --> 35:47.609
If you want to join a temple,
join one.

35:47.778 --> 35:50.212
But Alpha-O is a sorority.

35:51.849 --> 35:53.783
You're right, it is,

35:53.951 --> 35:55.475
and I would like you
to withdraw my name

35:55.653 --> 35:58.315
because I don't wanna be
a part of it.

36:20.144 --> 36:22.476
- What are you doing with that dog?
- It's my aunt's.

36:22.647 --> 36:24.239
- Well, lose it.
- In a minute.

36:24.415 --> 36:26.645
I don't wanna hold it.
Would you please take it?

36:26.817 --> 36:30.082
Why don't you be a little more friendly,
okay?

36:30.254 --> 36:33.121
Okay, dog, now you chill out.

36:35.693 --> 36:38.685
Since my "guys are dogs" analogy
seemed to get the fur flying a bit,

36:38.863 --> 36:42.959
I thought I'd put it to the test tonight
by doing a side by side comparison.

36:43.134 --> 36:46.228
Now, I got the guy, David Silver,
and I got the dog.

36:46.404 --> 36:49.373
Now, here's the scientific part,
the dog's name is Silver too.

36:49.540 --> 36:51.508
Donna, please.

36:51.676 --> 36:53.541
Silver, sit.

36:56.948 --> 37:01.248
My first observation, the dog appears
to be smarter than the guy.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.247
This is great, go right ahead.

37:03.421 --> 37:05.685
Lose all three people
who are listening to us right now.

37:06.123 --> 37:07.488
Okay, now, for the touch test.

37:07.658 --> 37:11.924
I've got my left hand on the guy
and I got my right hand on the dog.

37:12.096 --> 37:13.154
The guy feels pretty great.

37:14.398 --> 37:17.390
Hairy-back alert for the dog.
One point for the guy.

37:17.568 --> 37:19.627
Well, for what it's worth,
I don't have fleas either.

37:19.804 --> 37:21.169
Could you please move on with this?

37:21.339 --> 37:24.570
Okay, now. Let me throw this one out
to all you female listeners.

37:24.742 --> 37:27.233
How many of you out there
think that your dog loves you more

37:27.411 --> 37:28.435
than your boyfriend?

37:28.613 --> 37:32.071
We're standing by. I'm just trying
to lighten things up a bit between us.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.946
Well, you should have left
bad enough alone.

37:38.389 --> 37:40.084
David.

37:40.925 --> 37:44.258
- Yes.
- No way, there's people listening to us.

37:44.428 --> 37:45.452
We have an audience.

37:45.630 --> 37:47.530
Can you believe this?

37:48.266 --> 37:50.461
Well, before we handle
our many calls here,

37:50.635 --> 37:53.297
I'd just like to mention my guy
is definitely a better kisser

37:53.471 --> 37:55.530
than the dog, really.

37:59.176 --> 38:00.370
I don't know who I'm madder at.

38:00.544 --> 38:02.136
Alpha House, Leslie
or myself for thinking

38:02.313 --> 38:03.974
that a blue-eyed blond
couldn't be Jewish.

38:04.148 --> 38:06.776
It sounds to me like she's the one
who doesn't want anyone to know.

38:06.951 --> 38:08.612
If I was you, I'd give myself a break.

38:08.786 --> 38:12.085
I don't think I'm the only one
giving myself a hard time here.

38:12.256 --> 38:13.951
All you're doing
is not joining a sorority

38:14.125 --> 38:15.888
that you probably
wouldn't have joined anyway.

38:16.060 --> 38:17.994
I, on the other hand,
have to explain to my father

38:18.162 --> 38:20.722
why I'm throwing away
my future life in politics.

38:20.898 --> 38:23.298
Brandon, this Richland guy
has got a grudge against everyone.

38:23.467 --> 38:24.934
You're probably doing
the right thing.

38:25.102 --> 38:27.400
After what happened to you,
I'm not sure about the Greeks.

38:27.571 --> 38:29.266
Well, that might just be
Alpha House.

38:29.440 --> 38:30.532
I mean, we know KEG House

38:30.708 --> 38:32.835
is the least discriminating place
on the planet Earth.

38:33.010 --> 38:34.602
They'll take anybody
who can chug a beer.

38:34.779 --> 38:37.509
I know, now, Steve's gonna assume
I'm a shoo-in to join.

38:37.682 --> 38:38.706
Well, aren't you?

38:38.883 --> 38:42.319
Well, I like the guys and everything
but I'm just not sure.

38:42.486 --> 38:44.317
Andrea.

38:44.955 --> 38:46.855
I know I'm probably
the last person you wanna see

38:47.024 --> 38:48.753
but I need to speak to you.

38:48.926 --> 38:50.086
In private.

38:50.528 --> 38:51.893
Look, anything you have
to say to me

38:52.063 --> 38:54.531
you can say in front
of my friend Brandon.

38:55.966 --> 38:58.992
Well, when I told the girls
that you withdrew your name,

38:59.170 --> 39:00.296
they were really upset.

39:01.238 --> 39:03.172
They didn't care
about your Star of David

39:03.341 --> 39:05.002
or your religion or anything but you.

39:07.144 --> 39:08.168
That's what they say,

39:08.346 --> 39:10.610
but they obviously
don't make you feel that way.

39:10.781 --> 39:13.477
It's not the Alpha House.

39:14.251 --> 39:15.275
It's me.

39:16.921 --> 39:20.413
And what do you expect from a girl
whose family changed their last name

39:20.591 --> 39:22.923
from Schulman to Sumner?

39:24.228 --> 39:26.219
Listen, you two obviously
have a lot to talk about.

39:26.397 --> 39:27.864
I'm gonna excuse myself.

39:28.032 --> 39:29.761
Oh, how rude of me.

39:29.934 --> 39:33.700
Brandon Walsh,
this is Leslie Sumner Schulman.

39:34.939 --> 39:38.306
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:42.646 --> 39:43.670
Gentlemen.

39:43.848 --> 39:47.147
It says here in the Progressive Party
platform that we are the elite.

39:47.318 --> 39:49.786
No, John, that's elitist.

39:49.954 --> 39:51.319
I just thought you guys should know

39:51.489 --> 39:53.480
they're trying to dismantle
the whole Greek system.

39:53.657 --> 39:57.115
Hey, looks like we've moved up
to Priority Number 9 this year.

39:57.294 --> 39:58.318
Can you fight it?

39:58.496 --> 40:00.225
They do this every year
and then they realize

40:00.398 --> 40:03.390
that the Greek alumnus contribute
83 percent of CU's endowment.

40:03.567 --> 40:04.795
We're here to stay.

40:04.969 --> 40:06.436
Yeah, but that's not the point.

40:06.604 --> 40:10.563
No, the point is you were willing
to fight for our right to party.

40:12.376 --> 40:15.140
I'm so glad I burned my bridge
to the White House for you guys.

40:15.312 --> 40:18.042
Well, look on the bright side,
you're no longer a weasel-in-training.

40:18.215 --> 40:20.240
You're a KEG man.

40:20.918 --> 40:24.547
Listen, Steve, you're my best friend
and everything but...

40:24.722 --> 40:26.212
Pledge with me.

40:26.390 --> 40:28.551
You've got 50 new brothers here.

40:28.726 --> 40:32.355
I kind of feel like I wanna do this
on my own for a while, you know?

40:36.467 --> 40:38.458
You're GDI, Walsh.

40:40.638 --> 40:42.435
That's frat speak for?

40:42.606 --> 40:44.403
The I is for "independent. "

40:44.575 --> 40:47.237
The GD you can guess yourself,
cowboy.

40:48.612 --> 40:50.773
Join or not join.

40:50.948 --> 40:52.540
For what you did for us,

40:52.716 --> 40:54.547
we're making you
an honorary member.

40:54.718 --> 40:57.118
That, you cannot turn down.
