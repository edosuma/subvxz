You're going to pay
for what you did to me, Loomis.

Hey! Stop.

00:15.885 --> 00:18.018
-Let me see.
-Okay. I'm fine.

ALL:
Hello.

00:26.330 --> 00:27.810
What a surprise.

00:27.853 --> 00:29.246
I admire women
who try to remake themselves.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.553
Does that mean
you'll let me be in the club?

00:31.596 --> 00:33.120
CATHERINE:
I think you're responsible

00:33.163 --> 00:34.904
for his fall down the stairs.

00:34.947 --> 00:37.472
Once I can prove that,
I will destroy you.

00:37.515 --> 00:38.516
A photo of Catherine

00:38.560 --> 00:39.648
in bed with a young buck

00:39.691 --> 00:40.997
would disinherit her.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.608
That scarf looks lovely on you.

00:43.652 --> 00:45.349
I-I'm sorry. Is this person
a friend of yours?

00:45.393 --> 00:46.872
I'm his lover.

00:46.916 --> 00:49.049
You cheated on me with that?

00:49.092 --> 00:51.094
What's her name?
She humiliated me.

00:51.138 --> 00:52.356
I want to see her punished.

00:52.400 --> 00:53.879
RITA:
I think Alma

00:53.923 --> 00:56.534
is absolutely Elysian Park
Garden Club material.

00:57.579 --> 00:59.798
MARTHA:
I'm falling apart.

00:59.842 --> 01:02.366
Oh, but you don't want to hear
how sick I am.

01:02.410 --> 01:03.759
But I do.

01:03.802 --> 01:05.935
I really do.

01:10.331 --> 01:12.898
NARRATOR:
Her name was Harriet.

01:14.117 --> 01:16.815
Years earlier,
before her illness,

01:16.859 --> 01:19.644
she'd been a schoolteacher.

01:20.819 --> 01:22.517
So it was only natural

01:22.560 --> 01:25.955
she would want to impart
one last lesson.

01:27.087 --> 01:30.438
If you live long enough,
you will lose someone you love.

01:32.004 --> 01:36.183
Some people f-fall apart
when death knocks on their door.

01:36.226 --> 01:39.447
They shed buckets of tears.

01:39.490 --> 01:41.797
Well...

01:41.840 --> 01:44.104
I say it's a waste of water.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.586
Light that candle first.

01:50.371 --> 01:52.677
We should simply thank God

01:52.721 --> 01:54.810
for the time we had
with those we cared for.

01:54.853 --> 01:57.291
The ones who gave
our life meaning.

01:59.380 --> 02:02.209
Let's have music, too. Hmm?

02:02.252 --> 02:04.515
Something Italian, I think.

02:06.865 --> 02:08.867
[soft music playing]

02:10.956 --> 02:14.699
My point is,
I'm not afraid to die.

02:14.743 --> 02:17.528
So don't dwell in grief
once I've gone.

02:17.572 --> 02:20.140
I will be finally free
of suffering.

02:20.183 --> 02:22.185
That is something to celebrate.

02:25.275 --> 02:28.017
Is the syringe ready, Bertram?

02:29.323 --> 02:31.107
Yes, Mummy.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.543
Good.

02:33.849 --> 02:35.416
Let us begin.

02:39.463 --> 02:41.639
You put the needle in...

02:41.683 --> 02:43.424
where I point.

02:43.467 --> 02:45.208
I would do it myself,

02:45.252 --> 02:47.558
but you know what this disease
has done to my hands.

03:05.881 --> 03:09.450
It's a glorious thing
you've done tonight.

03:09.493 --> 03:12.235
And always remember that.

03:12.279 --> 03:14.455
Remember...

send their mothers to heaven.

NARRATOR:
It was not uncommon
for Bertram Fillcot

03:59.500 --> 04:01.676
to dream of his mother.

04:02.720 --> 04:06.333
So he wasn't at all surprised
to see her that night.

04:08.335 --> 04:11.599
But he was a bit startled
to discover...

04:12.643 --> 04:14.732
...that she'd brought company.

04:17.648 --> 04:18.736
[gasps]

04:20.825 --> 04:24.307
Bertram knew instantly
why they'd come,

04:24.351 --> 04:26.744
and what they expected of him.

04:33.185 --> 04:34.622

You look pale.

-No, I...
-Hmm.

04:44.022 --> 04:46.198
-I had a dream.
-Hmm.

04:46.242 --> 04:47.635
Martha Westcott was in it.

04:48.636 --> 04:49.680
Joan's aunt?

04:49.724 --> 04:51.682
Why dream about her?

04:51.726 --> 04:53.162
We spoke
for a long time yesterday,

04:53.205 --> 04:55.251
while you were busy with
the ladies from the Garden Club.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.644
ALMA:
Hmm.

04:56.687 --> 04:59.429
And she confessed to me
that she's seriously ill.

05:02.737 --> 05:04.391
Suffering from cancer.

05:04.434 --> 05:05.870
-No!
-Alma,

05:05.914 --> 05:07.350
she practically asked me
to kill her.

05:07.394 --> 05:10.048
If you could hear how much
she missed her dead husband...

05:10.092 --> 05:12.094
Well, you're not
going to arrange the reunion.

05:12.137 --> 05:13.704
Can't we at least discuss it?

05:13.748 --> 05:16.707
You gave me your solemn vow
you'd give up your little hobby.

05:16.751 --> 05:18.056
I'm trying to.

05:18.100 --> 05:19.536
But the urge...

05:19.580 --> 05:21.712
-It's returned.
-Oh. [scoffs]

05:21.756 --> 05:23.323
I'm just worried if I don't do
something to satisfy it soon,

05:23.366 --> 05:25.020
I might have
a complete mental breakdown.

05:25.063 --> 05:26.456
Nonsense.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.066
That's all in your head.

05:29.285 --> 05:30.721
Oh. Well, if that's the case,

05:30.765 --> 05:32.506
perhaps I should talk
to a psychiatrist.

05:35.247 --> 05:36.814
Have you lost your mind?

05:36.858 --> 05:38.990
That would be the topic
of conversation, yes.

05:39.034 --> 05:40.731
Psychiatrists gossip
just like everyone else.

05:40.775 --> 05:42.472
The risk is far too great.

05:42.516 --> 05:44.909
Well, I need to do something
to rid me of this compulsion.

05:44.953 --> 05:47.172
Bertram, I don't want
to discuss this.

05:47.216 --> 05:48.957
Please, can we just
go back to bed?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.393
I'm exhausted.

05:50.437 --> 05:52.221
Yeah, I'm sorry.

Everywhere I turn, lately,

06:47.755 --> 06:50.105
people are trying
to humiliate me.

06:50.148 --> 06:52.281
So I've been forced
to wreak a little havoc.

06:52.324 --> 06:54.109
Get a bit of revenge.

06:54.152 --> 06:55.458
What do you want revenge for?

You've got a fur coat,

Oh, Papa. You dropped the ball.

Gone where?

He left you a note.

10:22.491 --> 10:25.276
He took the bus to meet
someone down in Oxnard.

He'll be back tomorrow.

I-I was a bit curious
as to what prompted it,

Yes, well... to be honest, um...

of someone to talk to.

11:05.577 --> 11:07.362
Ah.

11:07.405 --> 11:09.625
I had a feeling.

Oh. Hey, Max.
You got a phone call.

11:16.632 --> 11:18.286
-Who is it?
-Some lady.

11:18.329 --> 11:19.548
Wouldn't give her name,

11:19.591 --> 11:21.463
but she insisted
on talking to the owner.

11:21.506 --> 11:23.378
Hello.

11:25.772 --> 11:27.077
So you're sure you're okay?

11:27.121 --> 11:29.079
I went to see Dr. Rice,

11:29.123 --> 11:31.212
and he said it was just a bump
on the noggin.

23:23.140 --> 23:24.533
Which felt good at the time,

23:24.577 --> 23:26.970
but I had no idea
she was in your club.

23:27.014 --> 23:29.756
And I certainly didn't know that
she would take it out on you.

23:29.799 --> 23:31.018
Oh, Mom.

23:31.061 --> 23:33.020
I'm so sorry she's hurt you.

23:33.063 --> 23:34.891
Mom?

23:34.935 --> 23:36.589
Can you say something?

23:36.632 --> 23:39.461
So Rita's cheating
on her husband.

23:40.549 --> 23:42.290
Uh... yeah.

23:42.333 --> 23:44.640
With an out-of-work actor.

23:45.772 --> 23:48.470
I'm surprised
she'd do such a thing.

23:48.514 --> 23:50.733
But not that I would?

23:50.777 --> 23:52.474
Oh, well, you're not married.

23:52.518 --> 23:54.520
I mean,
shame on you and all that,

23:54.563 --> 23:56.260
but we're talking about Rita.

23:56.304 --> 23:58.219
Okay.

23:58.262 --> 24:00.613
It all makes sense now.

24:00.656 --> 24:02.484
Of course
she doesn't want me in the club.

24:02.528 --> 24:05.008
Not only does she hate me
because I'm your mother,

24:05.052 --> 24:06.488
but she's afraid
of what I might know,

24:06.532 --> 24:08.185
what I might say
to the other ladies.

24:08.229 --> 24:10.492
You should say something.

24:10.536 --> 24:12.494
Let the whole town
know the truth about her.

24:12.538 --> 24:15.715
That she's a horrible,
vindictive woman.

24:15.758 --> 24:17.499
No.

24:17.543 --> 24:20.415
No, now is not the time
for spite.

24:20.459 --> 24:23.244
If I am to have satisfaction,

24:23.287 --> 24:25.855
I must be forgiving.

24:29.119 --> 24:30.773
You would forgive Rita?

24:30.817 --> 24:32.906
After everything
she's done to you?

24:32.949 --> 24:35.474
What does Proverbs say?

24:36.562 --> 24:40.261
"If thy enemy be hungry,
give her food to eat.

24:40.304 --> 24:43.482
"If she thirsts,
give her water to drink.

24:45.440 --> 24:49.096
"For thou shalt heap
hot coals upon her head,

24:49.139 --> 24:53.535
and the Lord will reward thee."

24:55.581 --> 24:57.931
This is why I love the Bible.

25:03.589 --> 25:05.112
SCOOTER:
So...

25:05.155 --> 25:07.157
you didn't mention a husband
waiting for you back home.

25:07.201 --> 25:08.419
Are you a widow?

25:09.508 --> 25:11.771
No. I never married.

25:11.814 --> 25:13.947
I bet you were asked,
though, huh?

25:13.990 --> 25:15.426
Plenty of times.

25:15.470 --> 25:17.603
Yes, I... I was asked.

25:17.646 --> 25:19.909
Turned him down, huh?

25:19.953 --> 25:22.216
Something like that.

25:23.217 --> 25:24.871
Good for you.

25:24.914 --> 25:26.525
It's better to wait
for the right guy.

25:26.568 --> 25:28.570
Don't worry.

25:28.614 --> 25:29.876
He'll show up.

25:32.966 --> 25:33.923
Um.

25:33.967 --> 25:35.272
Do I...

25:35.316 --> 25:36.839
I have something on my face?

25:36.883 --> 25:38.058
Just a little bit.

25:38.101 --> 25:39.059
No, no, no.

25:39.102 --> 25:40.495
Let me.

25:43.803 --> 25:46.545
So, uh, are you enjoying
your retirement, Father?

25:46.588 --> 25:49.504
Yes. Not to say
that I don't miss my parish

25:49.548 --> 25:50.810
and the people in it.

25:50.853 --> 25:53.116
Yeah. Well, everyone adored you.

25:53.160 --> 25:55.728
You were certainly there for me
when I needed you the most.

25:55.771 --> 25:59.775
You were a sweet child
put in an unimaginable position.

25:59.819 --> 26:04.388
I'm glad I was able
to provide some comfort.

26:04.432 --> 26:08.654
I still remember how you
calmed me down that awful day.

26:08.697 --> 26:10.960
You said God would understand
what I'd done. [chuckles]

26:11.004 --> 26:14.007
I wish He'd explain that
to my wife.

26:14.050 --> 26:19.447
You-you told Alma about
how you helped your mother?

26:19.490 --> 26:21.144
-Oh, no.
-Oh, good.

26:21.188 --> 26:22.319
It's in the past.

26:22.363 --> 26:24.104
Leave it there.

26:24.147 --> 26:26.497
But she did find out about
the others I've helped.

26:27.542 --> 26:28.935
Others?

26:28.978 --> 26:30.110
Yes.

26:30.153 --> 26:32.678
Alma isn't moved
to help the afflicted.

26:32.721 --> 26:34.810
She doesn't grasp why I need to.

26:34.854 --> 26:37.204
Compassion is always kind.

26:37.247 --> 26:39.032
No matter how it's delivered.

26:39.075 --> 26:41.208
She never had anyone
to teach her that.

26:41.251 --> 26:42.557
But luckily, I did.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.211
Did you say "others"?

26:44.254 --> 26:45.734
Well...

26:45.778 --> 26:47.823
I've met so many people
like my mother.

26:47.867 --> 26:50.783
Sick. Tormented.

26:50.826 --> 26:53.612
All ready to leave
this world behind.

26:53.655 --> 26:55.570
And I've helped them, too.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.747
The same way
you helped your mother?

26:58.791 --> 27:00.488
-Yes.
-[gasps]

27:00.531 --> 27:02.838
Do you recall
what you said to me?

27:02.882 --> 27:04.753
You said,
"God will forgive those

27:04.797 --> 27:06.320
who relieve
the suffering of others."

27:06.363 --> 27:07.930
I've always remembered that.

27:10.411 --> 27:12.500
I see. [chuckles]

27:30.736 --> 27:32.912
[coughing]

27:36.785 --> 27:39.179
You were saying?

27:40.746 --> 27:42.922
Not only did I get fired,

27:42.965 --> 27:45.402
I had to tell my mom
about my fling with Scooter.

27:45.446 --> 27:49.102
I begged her not to tell my dad,
but I know she will.

27:49.145 --> 27:52.061
So I think it's safe to say
this has been the lousiest day

27:52.105 --> 27:53.889
of my...

27:55.935 --> 27:57.850
I'm pouring my heart out here

27:57.893 --> 27:59.721
and you're grinning
like a hyena.

27:59.765 --> 28:01.288
Why?

28:01.331 --> 28:02.724
I was just thinking.

28:02.768 --> 28:04.813
About what?

28:05.901 --> 28:07.511
Well, during the war,
me and my buddies

28:07.555 --> 28:09.688
would talk about what it would
be like when we got back home.

28:10.776 --> 28:14.431
None of us expected
anything fancy.

28:14.475 --> 28:17.652
Just a quiet life
with a nice girl.

28:19.436 --> 28:23.049
Then I got hurt,
and my girl dumped me.

28:24.180 --> 28:27.227
I felt real sorry for myself.

28:27.270 --> 28:30.621
And I stopped thinking
about the future because...

28:30.665 --> 28:32.754
it didn't look bright.

28:34.364 --> 28:36.366
But now I'm here,

28:36.410 --> 28:39.500
with you,

28:39.543 --> 28:42.503
and I don't feel sorry
for myself anymore.

28:44.157 --> 28:45.985
Anyway...

28:46.028 --> 28:47.943
that's why I was smiling.

28:49.292 --> 28:50.772
But go on.

28:50.816 --> 28:52.774
Keep telling me
about your problems.

28:53.819 --> 28:55.908
Now that I think about it,

28:55.951 --> 28:58.171
I don't really have any.

29:05.134 --> 29:07.006
[doorbell rings]

29:10.705 --> 29:12.272
Hello.

29:12.315 --> 29:15.405
Could you tell Mrs. Castillo
Alma Fillcot is here to see her?

29:15.449 --> 29:17.451
I'm sorry. She's busy right now.

29:17.494 --> 29:19.714
Oh,
I think she'll want to see me.

29:26.503 --> 29:28.375
Oh, hello.

29:28.418 --> 29:30.551
Mr. Castillo?

29:32.422 --> 29:34.033
We met once.

29:34.076 --> 29:36.383
At a function.

29:36.426 --> 29:38.211
Alma Fillcot.

29:41.170 --> 29:43.172
[clears throat]

29:44.217 --> 29:45.827
I heard you had a nasty stroke.

29:45.871 --> 29:47.873
Is your recovery going well?

29:48.917 --> 29:50.440
[footsteps approach]

29:50.484 --> 29:52.138
-Mrs. Fillcot?
-Hmm?

29:52.181 --> 29:53.704
Mrs. Castillo
will see you upstairs.

29:53.748 --> 29:55.837
[gasps softly] Um...

29:55.881 --> 29:57.839
It-it was lovely
to chat with you.

30:01.974 --> 30:03.932
Okay.

30:03.976 --> 30:05.847
[clears throat] Thank you.

30:26.781 --> 30:27.782
Hello?

30:27.826 --> 30:28.870
RITA:
That's Carlo's room.

30:28.914 --> 30:31.830
I'm in my bedroom, in the back.

30:36.922 --> 30:38.662
Oh.

30:38.706 --> 30:40.839
Beautiful dressing room.

30:40.882 --> 30:43.406
What can I do for you, Alma?

30:44.668 --> 30:46.888
I'd like to talk
about what happened today.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.020
Oh.

30:48.063 --> 30:49.935
I know you were embarrassed,
but, uh...

30:49.978 --> 30:52.372
I already apologized
for the mistake.

30:52.415 --> 30:54.243
The "mistake."

30:55.244 --> 30:57.029
[chuckles]

30:57.072 --> 30:59.205
What are you smiling about?

31:00.293 --> 31:02.164
When we spoke in my kitchen
the other day,

31:02.208 --> 31:04.514
I felt that we were finally
getting to know one another.

31:04.558 --> 31:05.951
I was wrong.

31:05.994 --> 31:07.866
If you truly knew me, you'd know

31:07.909 --> 31:10.564
that you can trust me
with your secrets.

31:11.608 --> 31:12.827
What secrets?

31:14.394 --> 31:17.527
To be clear, when we spoke, I
knew nothing about you and...

31:17.571 --> 31:19.660
Oh, what is his name?

31:19.703 --> 31:21.009
Scooter.

31:21.053 --> 31:23.185
Dee only told me
that story today.

31:23.229 --> 31:25.709
I was sorry to hear
how rude she'd been to you.

31:25.753 --> 31:27.668
I did raise her
better than that.

31:27.711 --> 31:29.844
As for your friendship
with this...

31:29.888 --> 31:32.238
very handsome young actor...

31:32.281 --> 31:34.936
no one will hear
a word about it from me.

31:34.980 --> 31:37.591
Friends don't tattle on friends.

31:37.634 --> 31:38.940
But...

31:38.984 --> 31:41.638
I do hope that you'll honor
your promise

31:41.682 --> 31:43.423
and get me into the club.

31:43.466 --> 31:45.555
I know that you've
already accepted Ada,

31:45.599 --> 31:48.602
but surely the rules
can be bent a little bit.

31:48.645 --> 31:50.821
For an extra seat at the table.

31:52.998 --> 31:54.869
For a friend.

31:57.654 --> 31:59.134
[chuckling]

32:00.309 --> 32:03.225
Oh, Alma. [laughs]

32:03.269 --> 32:05.924
How masterful you are.

32:05.967 --> 32:09.057
How cleverly
you've cornered me into...

32:10.102 --> 32:11.799
...accepting you.

32:11.842 --> 32:13.714
I detect a note of sarcasm.

32:14.758 --> 32:17.544
You think you can waltz in here

32:17.587 --> 32:19.415
and threaten me in my own home?

32:19.459 --> 32:20.982
I wasn't making threats.

32:21.026 --> 32:22.331
I was offering friendship.

32:22.375 --> 32:24.638
[laughs] I don't want
your fucking friendship.

32:24.681 --> 32:27.380
If I were you,

32:27.423 --> 32:30.600
I would think very carefully
before speaking to me that way.

32:30.644 --> 32:32.385
[scoffs]
You can't touch me, Alma.

32:32.428 --> 32:35.083
I made sure of that.

32:35.127 --> 32:37.390
Why do you think I embarrassed
you today at lunch?

32:40.306 --> 32:42.612
I was making sure
that if you spread

32:42.656 --> 32:44.484
any gossip about me,
people would say,

32:44.527 --> 32:47.574
"Oh, you can't listen
to what Alma says about Rita.

32:47.617 --> 32:50.881
She's hated her ever since
that humiliating lunch."

32:50.925 --> 32:52.883
[chuckles]

32:52.927 --> 32:56.191
No one will ever believe
a word you say about me.

33:01.240 --> 33:03.546
Grace will believe me.

33:03.590 --> 33:05.722
-She'll back me up.
-[chuckles]

33:05.766 --> 33:08.856
Oh, Grace won't back you up.

33:08.899 --> 33:12.512
You see,
she knows that I know

33:12.555 --> 33:15.384
about the tawdry affair
she's been having.

33:15.428 --> 33:17.169
Grace is having an affair?

33:17.212 --> 33:19.084
With who?

33:19.127 --> 33:22.957
Oh, I'm holding on to
that little tidbit for security.

33:23.001 --> 33:24.480
But my point is,

33:24.524 --> 33:28.136
Grace won't lift a finger
to protect you.

33:28.180 --> 33:29.964
No.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.053
You can't hurt me, Alma.

33:32.097 --> 33:34.925
Oh, but I can hurt you.

33:34.969 --> 33:38.581
And that gob of pudding
you call a daughter...

33:38.625 --> 33:41.715
So you did get her fired.

33:41.758 --> 33:44.196
Oh, and I can do so much more.

33:44.239 --> 33:47.025
Think of the rumors
I can spread about her.

33:48.069 --> 33:50.202
Oh, and your husband...

33:51.246 --> 33:52.508
With one phone call,

33:52.552 --> 33:55.511
I can destroy
his entire practice.

33:55.555 --> 33:57.426
[scoffs]

33:57.470 --> 33:59.298
How horrible you are.

34:01.517 --> 34:03.345
To think I ever admired you.

34:03.389 --> 34:05.086
I don't want your admiration.

34:05.130 --> 34:07.001
Mm-mm.

34:08.959 --> 34:10.657
I want your fear.

34:10.700 --> 34:13.094
And now that I have it,

34:13.138 --> 34:15.662
get the hell out of my house.

34:42.950 --> 34:45.170
-[insects trilling]
-[bird calling]

34:49.130 --> 34:51.001
[gasps] Mr. Carlo.

34:51.045 --> 34:52.699
I was listening to the radio,
and I fell asleep.

34:52.742 --> 34:54.831
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

34:54.875 --> 34:56.268
You poor thing.

34:56.311 --> 34:59.140
Let's get you to bed
before Miss Catherine gets home.

34:59.184 --> 35:01.577
She will be so angry with me.

35:06.887 --> 35:08.889
-[panting]
-[laughing]

35:10.499 --> 35:11.674
Thank you.

35:11.718 --> 35:13.720
Thank you
for a wonderful evening.

35:13.763 --> 35:15.852
I haven't laughed like that
in a long time.

35:15.896 --> 35:17.680
Uh, maybe we should do it again
some night.

35:17.724 --> 35:19.421
Have dinner or something?

35:20.466 --> 35:22.120
[stammers]

35:22.163 --> 35:25.166
Why are you so anxious to spend
time with an old lady like me?

35:25.210 --> 35:26.994
Oh, I'm not anxious.

35:27.037 --> 35:28.517
It's just...

35:28.561 --> 35:30.302
you know...

35:30.345 --> 35:31.477
you're nice.

35:31.520 --> 35:33.087
Hmm.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.698
Is that the only reason?

35:35.742 --> 35:37.744
Also...

35:37.787 --> 35:40.921
you're a dame who doesn't know
how beautiful she is.

35:42.227 --> 35:43.967
I really dig that.

35:47.667 --> 35:49.669
Call you tomorrow.

35:55.631 --> 35:57.155
Hmm.

35:59.853 --> 36:02.203
A guy who washes dishes.

36:02.247 --> 36:05.206
-Boy, I hit the mother lode.
-[chuckles]

36:05.250 --> 36:06.599
I'm just glad
we got through a date

36:06.642 --> 36:07.861
that didn't end up
at the hospital.

36:07.904 --> 36:09.602
[laughs]

36:13.649 --> 36:15.477
[sighs]

36:16.478 --> 36:18.524
So. Um...

36:23.964 --> 36:25.444
So...

36:25.487 --> 36:26.749
Um...

36:27.881 --> 36:29.709
Thanks for coming over.

36:29.752 --> 36:31.972
It was a real good night.

36:33.016 --> 36:34.888
Does it have to be over?

36:35.932 --> 36:37.107
Meaning what?

36:37.151 --> 36:39.284
Meaning...

36:39.327 --> 36:41.155
I want to see your bedroom.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.287
Oh.

36:42.330 --> 36:43.549
Um...

36:43.592 --> 36:44.985
What's wrong?

36:47.509 --> 36:49.207
I don't think
that's a good idea.

36:49.250 --> 36:50.947
Why not?

36:50.991 --> 36:53.298
No. It's not you.

36:54.386 --> 36:55.517
It's me.

36:56.518 --> 36:57.911
Look, I haven't...

36:57.954 --> 37:01.393
I haven't been with somebody
since before the war.

37:02.785 --> 37:04.352
Because of...

37:04.396 --> 37:06.180
Yeah.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.443
I'm embarrassed.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.621
What that land mine
did to my body...

37:13.666 --> 37:15.450
Vern. No.

37:17.060 --> 37:18.714
It doesn't matter.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.084
Look, I should warn you.

37:41.128 --> 37:42.738
Don't speak.

37:52.357 --> 37:54.272
My chest isn't too bad.

37:54.315 --> 37:57.927
It's mostly my leg
and my back and my...

37:57.971 --> 38:00.190
-Shh.
-My neck and...

38:29.089 --> 38:31.091
♪

39:07.040 --> 39:09.042
[heavy breathing]

39:18.007 --> 39:21.794
Well, then I helped
Ira West die.

39:21.837 --> 39:24.144
Um... he had tuberculosis.

39:24.187 --> 39:26.407
After him was Sue Cork.

39:26.451 --> 39:27.756
She had suffered a stroke.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.149
Um, then I helped...

39:29.192 --> 39:30.933
I don't need to hear
about every victim.

39:30.977 --> 39:32.413
Just give me the grand total.

39:32.457 --> 39:35.155
Oh, uh. Right. Hmm.

39:37.505 --> 39:38.637
Twenty-six.

39:38.680 --> 39:41.074
You murdered 26 people?

39:41.117 --> 39:42.945
Sweet Jesus!

39:42.989 --> 39:44.294
I thought you'd understand.

39:44.338 --> 39:46.296
You were so kind to me
after I helped my mother.

39:46.340 --> 39:47.602
You were a child!

39:47.646 --> 39:49.865
Six is too young
to know right from wrong.

39:49.909 --> 39:52.868
I hoped you'd figure it out
by the time you were ten,

39:52.912 --> 39:54.043
let alone 40.

39:54.087 --> 39:56.829
You've got to stop this madness.

39:56.872 --> 39:57.960
Bertram, promise me.

39:58.004 --> 39:59.701
I'm trying, but it's hard.

39:59.745 --> 40:00.702
What's hard?

40:00.746 --> 40:02.356
You get up. You go to work.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.271
You don't kill. You come home.

40:04.314 --> 40:06.404
Do you think I want
to feel this way?

40:07.448 --> 40:09.668
Every day I leave my house,

40:09.711 --> 40:13.062
and I see
all the people in pain.

40:13.106 --> 40:15.456
On the streets, in cafés.

40:15.500 --> 40:18.981
Their eyes tell me
they're tired of living,

40:19.025 --> 40:20.983
that they yearn for death.

40:21.027 --> 40:23.595
To see their suffering,
but to do nothing for them?

40:23.638 --> 40:25.727
I can't bear it.

40:27.120 --> 40:28.904
-Uh...
-It torments you

40:28.948 --> 40:31.690
the-the way your mother's
pain tormented you?

40:31.733 --> 40:33.256
Yes!

40:33.300 --> 40:34.388
That's why you help them?

40:34.432 --> 40:36.608
Yes.

40:36.651 --> 40:39.132
And when you help them, Bertram,

40:39.175 --> 40:42.483
whose torment are you easing?

40:42.527 --> 40:44.485
Theirs or yours?

40:47.009 --> 40:48.968
You think these killings
are merciful. They're not.

40:49.011 --> 40:50.404
They're selfish.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.667
You're taking human life
to ease your own pain.

40:52.711 --> 40:54.539
So you'll feel better,
for a while.

40:54.582 --> 40:56.105
But it never lasts, does it?

40:57.150 --> 40:58.891
No.

41:02.198 --> 41:04.679
I think this is what Alma
was talking to me about.

41:04.723 --> 41:06.594
Then listen to her.

41:06.638 --> 41:08.640
God has blessed you
with a good woman

41:08.683 --> 41:12.382
who knows the worst of you
and loves you anyway.

41:12.426 --> 41:15.734
Heed her counsel,
for the rest of your days,

41:15.777 --> 41:18.301
and you can't go wrong.

41:19.433 --> 41:21.043
All right.

41:21.087 --> 41:23.306
So, no more killing?

41:25.091 --> 41:26.396
No. I swear.

41:31.619 --> 41:33.316
How much of that whiskey
do you intend on drinking?

41:33.360 --> 41:35.362
How much will keep me
from remembering

41:35.405 --> 41:37.059
this conversation tomorrow?

41:46.460 --> 41:48.418
[humming]

41:48.462 --> 41:50.464
[continues humming]

41:53.336 --> 41:55.643
Someone's in a good mood.

41:55.687 --> 41:57.036
Yes.

41:57.079 --> 41:59.386
So, please,
don't ruin it by speaking,

41:59.429 --> 42:00.779
or breathing.

42:00.822 --> 42:03.216
ISABEL:
Here you are, Mr. Carlo.

42:04.652 --> 42:06.524
Good morning, Papa.

42:06.567 --> 42:09.004
How are you feeling today?

42:09.048 --> 42:11.964
He's been fidgety.
I think he wanted to see you.

42:12.007 --> 42:13.269
Please.

42:13.313 --> 42:15.010
He doesn't even know
his first name anymore.

42:15.054 --> 42:16.708
Liar.

42:16.751 --> 42:18.405
His mind is fine.

42:18.448 --> 42:21.408
When we do therapy,
he obeys commands.

42:21.451 --> 42:22.888
-Right?
-He does?

42:22.931 --> 42:24.324
Yes.

42:24.367 --> 42:25.978
He even squeezed a ball
the other day in the park.

42:26.021 --> 42:27.980
[straining]

42:28.023 --> 42:29.242
What is it, Papa?

42:29.285 --> 42:31.374
Do you want to say something?

42:31.418 --> 42:33.376
[straining, mumbling]

42:33.420 --> 42:35.204
RITA:
He's probably just bored.

42:35.248 --> 42:38.077
Isabel, why don't you take him
outside for some fresh air?

42:39.339 --> 42:42.081
[straining]

42:42.124 --> 42:44.736
Oh, look. He's...
he's moving his finger.

42:44.779 --> 42:45.998
What?

42:46.041 --> 42:47.303
Do it again, Papa.

42:49.436 --> 42:51.351
I think he's pointing
at something.

42:51.394 --> 42:52.570
[mumbling]

42:54.963 --> 42:56.617
Is it the game?

42:56.661 --> 42:58.314
Do you want to play with us?

42:59.664 --> 43:01.709
[scoffs] Don't be ridiculous.

43:01.753 --> 43:03.450
He couldn't possibly...

43:05.104 --> 43:07.367
Is there something on the board?

43:11.719 --> 43:13.373
Oh! Ah.

43:13.416 --> 43:15.157
What the hell is wrong with you?

43:15.201 --> 43:17.116
I must have lost my footing.
I don't know.

43:17.159 --> 43:20.032
Isabel, help me clean this mess.

43:20.075 --> 43:21.642
ISABEL:
You got it.

43:29.955 --> 43:32.174
-[sobbing]
-Oh, Mom.

43:32.218 --> 43:33.872
Please don't cry.

43:33.915 --> 43:35.438
I can't help it.

43:35.482 --> 43:38.485
The way Rita
spoke to me was just...

43:38.528 --> 43:40.443
It was so demeaning.

43:40.487 --> 43:42.184
She's a horrible woman.

43:42.228 --> 43:43.838
Thank God
you'll never see her again.

43:43.882 --> 43:48.843
Maybe one of the other botanical
societies in town will have me.

43:48.887 --> 43:52.673
If word of my humiliation hasn't
spread across Los Angeles.

43:52.717 --> 43:55.241
There are lots of clubs

43:55.284 --> 43:57.373
that would be thrilled
to have you as a member.

43:59.506 --> 44:00.986
You're so sweet.

44:06.034 --> 44:07.253
We should start our day.

44:07.296 --> 44:09.168
You put the kettle on.

44:09.211 --> 44:10.343
I'll get the morning paper.

44:10.386 --> 44:12.127
[phone ringing]

44:13.172 --> 44:15.696
Uh, if that's your father...

44:15.740 --> 44:17.437
don't mention Rita.

44:17.480 --> 44:19.613
I can't handle him telling me
"I told you so."

44:19.657 --> 44:21.049
Not yet, anyway.

44:24.400 --> 44:26.576
-Hello?
-MAN: Dee?

44:26.620 --> 44:27.926
Good morning. It's Dr. Rice.

44:27.969 --> 44:29.579
Oh. Hi, Doc.

44:29.623 --> 44:31.451
The bump on my head
is feeling a lot better.

44:31.494 --> 44:33.148
Oh, good. Good. Um...

44:33.192 --> 44:36.108
But actually, I'm calling
because of those tests we ran.

44:36.151 --> 44:38.153
We discovered, uh...

44:38.197 --> 44:40.329
This is a bit delicate, but...

44:40.373 --> 44:43.289
Dee, are you aware
you're pregnant?

44:44.290 --> 44:46.292
[gasping]

44:49.687 --> 44:51.689
[sniffling]

45:10.359 --> 45:12.535
Oh. [gasps]

45:25.723 --> 45:29.552
NARRATOR:
As Alma looked at the ruins
of her beloved garden,

45:29.596 --> 45:34.079
she was filled
with a profound grief,

45:34.122 --> 45:36.821
unlike any she'd ever known.

45:39.301 --> 45:41.782
And then she saw the card.

45:41.826 --> 45:43.871
RITA:
Threaten me again,

45:43.915 --> 45:46.526
and this will be your family.

45:46.569 --> 45:48.310
NARRATOR:
And just like that,

45:48.354 --> 45:51.879
her grief
was transformed into rage.

45:54.577 --> 45:56.101
For a moment,

45:56.144 --> 45:59.539
Alma wondered how she would
go about punishing Rita.

46:01.759 --> 46:05.850
That's when this timid, awkward
mouse of a woman remembered...

46:06.938 --> 46:09.810
...she was married
to a serial killer.
