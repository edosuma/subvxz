00:35.236 --> 00:36.635
Fucking...

00:36.637 --> 00:38.704
Fucking cheater!

01:35.496 --> 01:37.162
Hey!

01:44.238 --> 01:48.507
¶ Take this terrifying moment ¶

01:48.509 --> 01:53.579
¶ Don't look at the other side ¶

01:57.651 --> 02:00.519
¶ If you hesitate ¶

02:00.521 --> 02:03.889
¶ You'll never break away ¶

02:03.891 --> 02:09.161
¶ From your glass case ¶

02:11.298 --> 02:12.664
¶ Even now ¶

02:12.666 --> 02:14.666
¶ Could be the only ¶

02:14.668 --> 02:18.170
¶ Place we'll ever have to hide ¶

02:18.172 --> 02:23.242
¶ Hear my body tell the truth ¶

03:03.717 --> 03:04.883
Hey, it's Greg.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.485
Michelle wants the
changes to the docket.

03:06.487 --> 03:08.654
Can you send them before
you leave for the weekend?

03:08.656 --> 03:09.821
I already did.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.323
Yeah, no, I got those.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.458
But we have new language.

03:15.196 --> 03:17.462
No, I mean I already left the office.

03:17.464 --> 03:19.231
What?

03:19.233 --> 03:20.716
I'm getting on a ferry.

03:20.717 --> 03:22.200
You know it's only two o'clock, right?

03:22.203 --> 03:23.368
I gotta go, I'll see you Tuesday.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.971
But what about...

05:22.623 --> 05:26.858
¶ A kiss ¶

05:26.860 --> 05:29.761
¶ From your lips ¶

05:29.763 --> 05:33.765
¶ Changed my whole life around ¶

05:46.113 --> 05:46.962
Oh, jeez.

05:46.963 --> 05:47.812
Hey, it's Greg.

05:47.815 --> 05:50.349
Call me back when you get...

05:52.086 --> 05:53.752
Listen, I took care of the docket

05:53.754 --> 05:55.754
but I'd appreciate it if
you keep me in the loop

05:55.756 --> 05:56.922
when you have outside commitments.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.457
Piece of shit.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.691
Excuse me?

05:59.693 --> 06:01.360
Oh, no, nothing.

06:02.062 --> 06:04.529
Do you need anything else?

06:04.531 --> 06:06.765
Just the check, please.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.467
Hi Joseph, it's Michelle.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.569
I spoke with Greg.

06:10.571 --> 06:12.471
I went ahead and set
up a feedback session

06:12.473 --> 06:14.906
for next week with me and HR, okay?

06:14.908 --> 06:16.441
See you Tuesday.

06:27.454 --> 06:28.520
Boyfriend?

06:30.724 --> 06:31.656
Work.

06:32.693 --> 06:34.092
That's too bad.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.728
Where do you work?

06:36.730 --> 06:38.063
At a law firm.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.666
I'm gonna guess.

06:42.603 --> 06:43.735
Receptionist?

06:44.671 --> 06:45.604
Lawyer.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.006
Wow.

06:54.448 --> 06:57.449
You know,

06:57.450 --> 07:00.451
this is a great place to forget
about troubles like that.

07:02.689 --> 07:03.955
I'll pay now.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.730
Where you going so quickly?

07:11.732 --> 07:13.165
I'm meeting friends.

07:13.167 --> 07:15.100
They can wait.

07:18.639 --> 07:19.971
Oh, no, sorry.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.074
We're headed to a drag show.

07:24.978 --> 07:27.446
Work on your lies, little lawyer.

07:27.448 --> 07:29.448
And friendly tip,

07:29.450 --> 07:31.716
no one goes to the Meat Rack anymore.

07:31.718 --> 07:32.818
What?

07:32.820 --> 07:34.820
I saw you Googling.

07:34.822 --> 07:37.088
I thought a young one
like you would've known.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.758
It's all Grinder now, sweetie.

07:42.930 --> 07:44.663
¶ Gee ¶

07:44.665 --> 07:45.997
¶ Gee ¶

07:45.999 --> 07:51.069
¶ How blessed I am ¶

07:53.474 --> 07:58.543
¶ To have a kiss ¶

08:01.014 --> 08:05.550
¶ From your lips ¶

08:26.907 --> 08:28.940
Find everything okay?

08:30.777 --> 08:31.710
$78.65.

08:43.155 --> 08:46.525
Do you have a changing room by chance?

08:46.527 --> 08:47.893
I forgot to ask before.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.561
We don't, sorry.

08:52.065 --> 08:52.998
Okay.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.169
Thank you.

09:03.844 --> 09:04.776
Excuse me.

09:06.547 --> 09:08.947
Do you know where the parties are?

09:08.949 --> 09:10.682
I read online somewhere about...

09:10.684 --> 09:14.286
Oh, the season hasn't
really started yet, honey.

09:14.288 --> 09:16.021
You're a little early.

09:16.023 --> 09:17.556
Oh.

09:17.558 --> 09:18.924
You might check down at the pavilion.

09:18.926 --> 09:22.327
There's something
going on, they'll know.

09:43.016 --> 09:48.086
¶ Give me some sugar, baby ¶

09:48.956 --> 09:53.692
¶ Give me some sugar, baby ¶

09:54.661 --> 09:59.731
¶ Give me some sugar, baby ¶

10:06.039 --> 10:08.340
Oh, if you want it, stop eating now.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.178
Oh, joke, honey.

10:31.632 --> 10:32.297
Hey, sweetie.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.898
Hey, you called?

10:33.900 --> 10:34.866
Oh yeah, your driver's license

10:34.868 --> 10:36.735
showed up here by mistake.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.803
I'll mail it to you tomorrow.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.805
Okay, thanks.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.340
Are you at work?

10:42.342 --> 10:43.875
I'm actually outside.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.076
I needed some fresh air.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.044
Oh, good for you, honey.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.912
Well, exciting as ever here.

10:47.914 --> 10:49.981
I'm doing a thrilling load of laundry.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.083
Doing anything fun for
the holiday weekend?

10:52.085 --> 10:53.652
Not really.

10:53.654 --> 10:54.686
No dates or anything like that?

10:54.688 --> 10:55.887
Mom.

10:55.889 --> 10:56.421
Hey, just asking.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.089
A mom can ask.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.758
You know who I was
thinking about recently

10:59.760 --> 11:01.660
was that friend of yours from school.

11:01.662 --> 11:04.195
Ran into his mom at parent's weekend.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.430
Johnathon?

11:05.432 --> 11:06.831
Yeah, Johnathon, that's it.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.199
I think he works in
finance or something

11:08.201 --> 11:10.669
because he's always
posting news articles

11:10.671 --> 11:13.338
about this company
he sold to some bank.

11:13.340 --> 11:14.739
First Bank.

11:14.741 --> 11:17.242
I don't know, maybe
it's all Russian bots.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.077
Who can tall what's real these days?

11:19.079 --> 11:21.680
Well, anyway, he lives
in New York, doesn't he?

11:21.682 --> 11:22.881
Yeah.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.816
Well.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.785
Mom, Johnathon's straight.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.186
Really?

11:28.188 --> 11:30.755
Gosh, he seems so soft to me.

11:31.425 --> 11:33.324
Maybe he knows people.

11:35.729 --> 11:36.961
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

11:36.963 --> 11:39.030
I didn't mean to imply
you don't know people.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.098
It's fine.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.866
You know,

11:41.868 --> 11:43.435
I was just reading
an article about how

11:43.437 --> 11:47.338
some of the smartest
people are introverts.

11:47.340 --> 11:48.707
Mom.

11:48.709 --> 11:49.474
Oh honey, I'm sorry.

11:49.476 --> 11:50.875
I'll let you get back to work.

11:50.877 --> 11:53.044
Everything there okay?

11:53.046 --> 11:53.978
It's...

11:55.882 --> 11:58.083
I'm actually thinking about leaving.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.151
Doing something more
meaningful with my life

12:00.153 --> 12:03.188
with defense or
something, I don't know.

12:03.190 --> 12:06.891
Feel like I haven't found
my place yet, you know?

12:08.228 --> 12:09.427
Are you there?

12:10.931 --> 12:12.731
Baby, I'm so sorry, the dyer beeped.

12:12.733 --> 12:13.932
Can you say that again?

12:13.934 --> 12:15.467
Nothing, I gotta go,
I'll talk to you later.

12:15.469 --> 12:16.334
Are you sure?

12:16.336 --> 12:18.403
Yeah, I love you, bye.

12:37.290 --> 12:38.823
Hey.

12:38.825 --> 12:39.791
Hi.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.292
What's your name?

12:41.294 --> 12:42.193
Joseph.

12:43.530 --> 12:44.996
Just Joseph?

12:44.998 --> 12:45.830
Not Joey

12:47.033 --> 12:47.966
or...

12:48.835 --> 12:49.934
- Jo-Jo?
- No.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.041
Okay.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.249
How long are you here?

13:05.051 --> 13:06.985
I don't know.

13:06.987 --> 13:09.287
I might be leaving soon.

13:09.289 --> 13:12.857
I'm not having as much
fun as I thought I would.

13:12.859 --> 13:14.859
This your first time?

13:17.197 --> 13:19.063
Who're you here with?

13:22.068 --> 13:24.335
Well no fucking wonder, buddy!

13:24.337 --> 13:27.305
You're here by yourself
at the off-season?

13:27.307 --> 13:29.574
Ugh, talk about thirsty.

13:29.576 --> 13:32.877
Shut up.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.281
Do you want to?

13:42.222 --> 13:44.522
Show me how thirsty you are.

13:55.468 --> 13:58.469
Have you been to the Meat Rack yet?

14:31.238 --> 14:33.538
Did you hear that?

14:33.540 --> 14:35.306
Hear what?

14:35.308 --> 14:37.242
I thought I heard...

14:38.411 --> 14:39.344
Nevermind.

14:40.881 --> 14:42.013
You feeling okay?

14:42.015 --> 14:42.947
Yeah.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.483
Take off your shirt?

15:32.198 --> 15:33.531
Close your eyes.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.112
Relax.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.092
I feel...

16:01.094 --> 16:02.627
Easy, easy.

16:03.697 --> 16:04.696
I feel...

16:06.266 --> 16:08.132
I feel heavy.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.200
It's okay.

16:12.305 --> 16:15.273
Stop.

16:15.275 --> 16:16.641
Stop.

16:16.643 --> 16:17.976
No.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.549
Stay down, faggot!

17:48.735 --> 17:50.301
Hey!

19:00.273 --> 19:01.139
What the fuck?

19:01.141 --> 19:02.373
Oh my God, Carlos.

19:02.375 --> 19:03.774
Basic bitch made me spill my drink.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.710
You've had enough anyway.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.445
So has he, come on.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.405
He stirs.

20:41.407 --> 20:42.573
Where am I?

20:42.575 --> 20:46.244
You're in the Pines, and I'm Cameron,

20:46.246 --> 20:47.979
the one you can thank.

20:52.452 --> 20:53.884
You were out for awhile there.

20:53.886 --> 20:54.819
You...

20:56.389 --> 20:58.356
You allergic to asprin?

21:15.575 --> 21:16.707
There you go.

21:25.285 --> 21:26.450
Help!

21:29.489 --> 21:30.354
Hey.

21:30.356 --> 21:31.389
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:31.391 --> 21:32.757
- I gotta go.
- You're okay.

21:32.759 --> 21:34.058
- I gotta go.
- You're fine.

21:34.060 --> 21:35.026
You're fine.

21:35.028 --> 21:37.561
Hey, hey, it's all right.

21:37.563 --> 21:39.563
Okay, all right.

21:39.565 --> 21:40.464
Just...

21:41.367 --> 21:42.933
Take a breath, okay?

21:52.679 --> 21:54.312
I'm sorry.

21:54.314 --> 21:55.646
No, it's okay.

22:14.867 --> 22:16.667
What'd they say?

22:16.669 --> 22:20.071
Just to go to a
branch when I get back.

22:24.911 --> 22:26.811
How's the headache?

22:28.348 --> 22:31.349
You a doctor or something?

22:31.351 --> 22:33.918
Took a first aid course once.

22:35.555 --> 22:38.889
Is there anyone else you wanna call?

22:38.891 --> 22:39.957
Not really.

22:41.894 --> 22:43.561
Anyways, I probably wouldn't
even know their numbers.

22:43.563 --> 22:45.629
They're all in my phone.

22:45.631 --> 22:47.898
Thanks for letting me
borrow yours, by the way.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.033
No problem.

23:02.648 --> 23:05.116
Do you remember anything else?

23:08.654 --> 23:09.587
I...

23:13.860 --> 23:15.793
I'm just really tired.

23:17.797 --> 23:18.729
Well,

23:19.932 --> 23:21.799
you're welcome to stay here for now.

23:21.801 --> 23:24.068
Spare room you can crash in.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.002
Thanks.

23:27.006 --> 23:27.938
No problem.

23:27.940 --> 23:30.608
Just let me know what you need.

23:32.979 --> 23:34.578
Thank you for everything.

23:34.580 --> 23:38.749
Oh my God, stop saying
that, it's not the Oscars.

23:42.955 --> 23:44.088
I'm gonna.

26:01.227 --> 26:02.993
Joseph!

26:06.999 --> 26:07.965
Beyonce?

26:07.967 --> 26:09.266
She's Carly Ray.

26:09.268 --> 26:10.734
There he is.

26:10.736 --> 26:11.969
How'd you sleep in there?

26:11.971 --> 26:13.237
Oh, fine.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.939
Thanks for the clothes.

26:14.941 --> 26:18.042
Oh, Cameron, you are a classy slut.

26:19.245 --> 26:20.110
Jealous.

26:20.112 --> 26:21.579
Joseph,

26:21.581 --> 26:22.713
how're you feeling?

26:22.715 --> 26:24.315
Joseph, this is
Anabi, he's a physician.

26:24.317 --> 26:26.684
That's Shane, he's an asshole.

26:26.686 --> 26:28.986
Funny.

26:28.987 --> 26:31.287
I'd just be happy to take a
look at you later if you like.

26:31.290 --> 26:32.923
I'm fine, thank you.

26:32.925 --> 26:33.857
I feel fine.

26:33.859 --> 26:34.725
Do you want some breakfast?

26:34.727 --> 26:36.060
Sure.

26:44.203 --> 26:47.671
So you got fucking drugged and mugged.

26:48.641 --> 26:50.007
- I'm...
- Shane!

26:50.009 --> 26:52.876
Sorry, what, that's crazy.

26:52.878 --> 26:54.278
Yeah.

26:54.280 --> 26:55.613
So,

26:55.615 --> 26:58.148
what brings you to Fire Island?

26:59.352 --> 27:00.784
Oh, I've never been.

27:00.786 --> 27:01.919
Weren't missing much.

27:01.921 --> 27:03.954
He's just mad because
he can't use apps.

27:03.956 --> 27:07.691
I know how to use them, I
just mourn the way things were.

27:07.693 --> 27:09.326
You want it back that way?

27:09.328 --> 27:11.328
I'm just saying, the '70s, okay...

27:11.330 --> 27:14.164
None of us were
around in the '70s, so.

27:14.166 --> 27:15.899
Well, I know that,
but that's not my point.

27:15.901 --> 27:17.901
What were we missing out on?

27:17.902 --> 27:19.902
Like hiding behind the bushes
to hook up with some dude?

27:19.905 --> 27:21.238
Hello?

27:22.108 --> 27:23.273
No offense.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.242
See, this is why I
can't take you nowhere.

27:25.244 --> 27:27.945
I didn't go to the woods
to hook up, for the record.

27:27.947 --> 27:30.981
Sure you didn't, sweetie.

27:32.018 --> 27:34.051
Are you in the city?

27:34.053 --> 27:35.419
Yeah.

27:35.421 --> 27:37.588
I went to school there.

27:37.589 --> 27:39.756
I work at a law firm
and I live in Harlem.

27:39.759 --> 27:40.758
I love Harlem.

27:40.760 --> 27:41.792
Gentrification much?

27:41.794 --> 27:43.327
Oh my God, Shane, shut up.

27:43.329 --> 27:44.695
What? It's true.

27:44.697 --> 27:45.929
No, no, it's true, it's true.

27:45.931 --> 27:47.164
I own it.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.032
It's convenient.

27:48.034 --> 27:50.067
Mmmm, he owns that.

27:50.069 --> 27:52.069
Come on, woke white boy.

27:52.071 --> 27:53.270
You better lock this down

27:53.272 --> 27:54.805
or you're gonna be in serious trouble.

27:54.807 --> 27:56.340
So, do you have a boyfriend?

27:56.342 --> 27:57.941
Don't mind Shane.

27:57.943 --> 27:59.176
He has a dick sucking problem.

27:59.178 --> 28:01.629
He's just a tad desperate.

28:01.630 --> 28:04.081
Says the doctor who offered
to give him a free physical.

28:04.083 --> 28:06.083
I'm just doing my part
for universal healthcare.

28:06.085 --> 28:07.451
Ew, ew, ew.

28:07.453 --> 28:10.254
Okay, back to the question, please.

28:10.256 --> 28:13.891
No, no boyfriend
but I really want one.

28:13.893 --> 28:15.826
I mean a relationship.

28:17.163 --> 28:18.696
That came out weird.

28:18.698 --> 28:20.330
No, that just came out.

28:20.332 --> 28:21.832
Hey, you're one to talk.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.734
So have you ever been to "the cock?"

28:23.736 --> 28:25.135
Oh my God, Shane.

28:25.137 --> 28:26.737
When was the last time you had sex?

28:26.739 --> 28:27.971
This is not about
me, this is about him.

28:27.973 --> 28:28.839
A year.

28:28.841 --> 28:29.707
Stop it.

28:29.709 --> 28:31.241
I'm more game than that.

28:31.243 --> 28:32.176
Two years.

28:32.178 --> 28:33.110
Ew.

28:33.112 --> 28:34.712
You're insulting me, trash.

28:34.714 --> 28:38.115
That congressman who you met in D.C.

28:38.117 --> 28:39.216
I have no idea
what they're talking about.

28:39.218 --> 28:40.184
The Republican.

28:40.186 --> 28:41.351
Yep.

28:41.353 --> 28:42.186
Oh my God, you haven't had any sex

28:42.188 --> 28:43.387
since the Republican?

28:43.389 --> 28:45.255
Aw, are you masterbating at least?

28:45.257 --> 28:47.324
Stop it, climate
change is affecting everything.

28:47.326 --> 28:49.159
A drought is a drought
is a drought, assholes.

28:52.732 --> 28:55.065
So, do you guys rent
this place out every year?

28:55.067 --> 28:57.334
Does it look like I
can afford this place?

28:57.336 --> 29:00.370
No, this is all Cam and Rafael.

29:00.372 --> 29:01.972
Mmmm, how's he doing, by the way?

29:01.974 --> 29:02.906
What?

29:02.908 --> 29:04.274
What happened to Rafael?

29:04.276 --> 29:05.909
Well he and Marcus broke it off.

29:05.911 --> 29:06.877
What?

29:06.879 --> 29:08.011
Shut the front door, when?!

29:08.013 --> 29:09.046
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

29:09.048 --> 29:09.980
Was it his boyfriend?

29:09.982 --> 29:10.981
Fiance!

29:10.983 --> 29:11.515
- When did they break up?
- Stop.

29:11.517 --> 29:13.183
Okay, just stop!

29:17.256 --> 29:19.456
Sorry, I didn't mean to...

29:21.927 --> 29:25.028
It's just really stressful
right now for him.

29:25.030 --> 29:27.030
For both of them.

29:27.032 --> 29:27.965
And...

29:28.968 --> 29:32.169
He left this morning anyways, so.

29:32.171 --> 29:33.103
Whatever.

30:10.910 --> 30:14.545
¶ Don't you forget about me ¶

30:14.547 --> 30:18.482
¶ You've been with me all along ¶

30:18.484 --> 30:22.486
¶ Don't you forget about me ¶

30:22.488 --> 30:27.524
¶ Because I won't forget you ¶

30:33.365 --> 30:35.299
So, you work in D.C.

30:39.972 --> 30:41.655
Yeah.

30:41.656 --> 30:43.339
I professionally analyze things.

30:43.342 --> 30:44.575
That's vague.

30:47.379 --> 30:48.846
Do you like it?

30:49.582 --> 30:51.982
I used to.

30:51.984 --> 30:55.085
So why don't you do something else?

30:56.856 --> 30:58.388
I'm sorry.

30:58.390 --> 31:01.124
Didn't you say you're a lawyer?

31:01.126 --> 31:03.193
I like being a lawyer.

31:04.263 --> 31:06.930
I just wanna be a different kind.

31:08.000 --> 31:08.866
Oh.

31:08.868 --> 31:10.601
Well la di da for you.

31:12.538 --> 31:15.272
If you're unhappy you
should change things, right?

31:15.274 --> 31:16.940
I didn't say I was unhappy.

31:16.942 --> 31:17.875
But you just said...

31:17.877 --> 31:19.977
I said I didn't like my job

31:19.979 --> 31:22.145
but I'm very good at it.

31:22.147 --> 31:24.348
That makes me kinda happy.

31:25.517 --> 31:26.450
Huh.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.554
So what do you analyze?

31:32.958 --> 31:34.157
So shady.

31:34.159 --> 31:35.158
I am not.

31:37.563 --> 31:39.029
Are you military?

31:39.031 --> 31:39.930
CIA?

31:41.634 --> 31:42.566
No.

31:44.436 --> 31:45.669
State Department.

31:45.671 --> 31:48.138
But I as sort of in the military.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.006
Really?

31:49.008 --> 31:50.407
Translator.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.943
I was stationed in Germany for awhile.

31:52.945 --> 31:53.677
Wow.

31:55.114 --> 31:57.281
What do you speak?

31:57.283 --> 31:58.515
Many tongues.

31:59.418 --> 32:01.418
Say something.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.587
What do you want me to say?

32:03.589 --> 32:04.621
Anything.

32:05.591 --> 32:07.024
"Anything."

32:07.026 --> 32:08.225
You're dumb.

32:09.194 --> 32:12.062
You gotta give me the language.

32:14.300 --> 32:15.198
German.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.400
Ugh, boring.

32:22.074 --> 32:24.107
"I love to drink
mimosas on the weekend."

32:27.947 --> 32:30.347
How do I know you're
not bullshitting me?

32:30.349 --> 32:31.415
You don't.

32:32.618 --> 32:33.550
Huh.

32:34.954 --> 32:36.486
Spanish?

32:41.493 --> 32:42.693
I guess that's right.

32:42.695 --> 32:46.330
Oh, you guess?

32:47.633 --> 32:48.565
Arabic.

33:01.513 --> 33:03.513
It's from "A Thousand and One Nights."

33:03.515 --> 33:06.450
I had to translate the texts once.

33:09.088 --> 33:10.654
My grandparents served.

33:10.656 --> 33:12.422
World War II.

33:12.424 --> 33:14.691
I could never handle it.

33:14.693 --> 33:16.126
Sure you could.

33:16.128 --> 33:17.194
You're out, right?

33:17.196 --> 33:18.362
It's not the same.

33:18.364 --> 33:20.998
You know, putting
your life on the line.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.532
You are in some places.

33:22.534 --> 33:25.102
You know what I mean.

33:25.104 --> 33:27.404
It's still an act of defiance.

33:27.406 --> 33:30.474
And you can't have social
change without acts of defiance.

33:30.476 --> 33:32.743
Whether they're
against a foreign power

33:32.745 --> 33:35.545
or tyranny of the moral majority.

33:35.547 --> 33:39.316
Preach.

33:39.318 --> 33:40.550
I didn't mean.

33:40.552 --> 33:42.786
Wasn't long ago I
couldn't openly serve.

33:42.788 --> 33:44.187
Queens, let's go!

33:44.189 --> 33:47.124
We cannot be late to the
preseason pool party.

33:47.126 --> 33:49.126
You want mimosas?

33:49.128 --> 33:50.127
I'm good.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.030
Joseph?

33:53.032 --> 33:55.232
Am I okay to drink?

33:55.234 --> 33:56.533
Bitch, you don't need his permission!

33:56.535 --> 33:59.202
You want mosas, you get mosas!

34:08.347 --> 34:11.481
You looking for something?

34:11.483 --> 34:12.416
No.

34:16.722 --> 34:19.656
Good, because I wasn't offering.

34:26.197 --> 34:28.264
I hate people sometimes.

34:29.467 --> 34:30.801
Especially here.

34:37.176 --> 34:38.574
What's your name?

34:43.514 --> 34:46.183
Not much of a talker, huh?

34:46.185 --> 34:47.117
Nope.

34:49.321 --> 34:50.587
Look, I just came over to say hi.

34:50.589 --> 34:53.690
You don't have to be a dick about it.

34:54.659 --> 34:56.525
Okay, you've said hi.

35:01.100 --> 35:03.200
You can go now.

35:03.201 --> 35:05.301
I'll let you get back
to drinking your feelings.

35:07.806 --> 35:09.606
You can leave now.

35:24.656 --> 35:26.456
Give me your shit.

35:30.529 --> 35:31.728
Dude, just go.

35:31.730 --> 35:32.662
I said,

35:34.900 --> 35:37.734
give me your shit, fucking loser.

35:44.510 --> 35:46.676
You fuck, you broke my fucking hand!

35:46.678 --> 35:49.029
It's a sprain.

35:49.030 --> 35:51.381
I can show you a break
if you want, though.

36:56.348 --> 36:57.280
Hello.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.220
Hey!

37:03.222 --> 37:05.855
No semen in the hot tub, you two!

37:13.298 --> 37:14.631
Sluts.

37:14.633 --> 37:17.234
Wow, what a great first
party of the season.

37:17.236 --> 37:18.435
Yeah.

37:18.437 --> 37:20.403
This is why you don't
do Fire Island in April.

37:20.405 --> 37:23.773
Hey, I told you about the
climate change like 16 times!

37:23.775 --> 37:25.008
I'm sorry, were you talking?

37:25.010 --> 37:26.409
Shut up!

37:26.411 --> 37:28.445
Anyways, anyways, it's newbie's turn.

37:28.447 --> 37:29.479
Let's hear it.

37:29.481 --> 37:31.014
Never have I ever

37:32.017 --> 37:33.650
kissed a girl before.

37:33.652 --> 37:34.884
- Come on.
- Boo!

37:34.886 --> 37:37.354
Stop it, you're wasting our time.

37:37.356 --> 37:40.290
People demand something juicier.

37:51.370 --> 37:53.036
Well, rules are rules,
rules are rules.

37:53.038 --> 37:54.638
Drink up, fellas.

37:54.640 --> 37:55.438
Hurry up so we can
get to the good questions.

37:55.440 --> 37:56.473
Shots!

37:56.475 --> 37:57.540
Yes!

37:57.542 --> 37:58.742
Give me one!

37:58.744 --> 38:00.010
Come on, everybody,
you have to do one!

38:00.012 --> 38:01.645
Oh my God, everyone take one.

38:01.647 --> 38:02.812
Let's go.

38:02.814 --> 38:04.514
To swallowing.

38:04.516 --> 38:05.715
To swallowing.

38:09.721 --> 38:13.623
¶ I'll be in your
dreams tonight, babe ¶

38:13.625 --> 38:17.661
¶ You'll be in my arms ¶

38:17.663 --> 38:21.598
¶ I'll be in your dreams, baby ¶

38:21.600 --> 38:24.901
¶ You'll be in my arms ¶

38:41.887 --> 38:46.690
¶ I'll be in your
dreams tonight, babe ¶

38:46.692 --> 38:47.624
What can I get for you?

38:47.626 --> 38:49.659
Two Ballast Points, please.

38:49.661 --> 38:50.593
Coming right up.

38:50.595 --> 38:51.661
Thank you.

38:59.104 --> 39:00.003
Hey.

39:00.005 --> 39:00.937
Hey.

39:05.944 --> 39:06.876
I'm sorry.

39:08.647 --> 39:09.779
About what?

39:12.517 --> 39:13.450
Earlier.

39:14.453 --> 39:15.919
If I offended you.

39:17.856 --> 39:22.492
¶ I'll be in your
dreams tonight, babe ¶

39:22.494 --> 39:23.560
Thank you.

40:20.619 --> 40:22.619
What're we doing?

40:22.621 --> 40:24.654
What do you think?

40:27.459 --> 40:29.859
Shouldn't we lock the door?

40:31.029 --> 40:31.928
No.

40:36.935 --> 40:37.834
What if someone...

40:37.836 --> 40:38.902
Oh my God.

40:41.139 --> 40:42.172
You nervous?

40:43.708 --> 40:44.641
A little.

41:02.961 --> 41:04.894
Get out! Get out! Get out!

41:04.896 --> 41:06.963
Why'd you say that?

41:06.965 --> 41:10.934
Whose idea was it to fucking
go in the bathroom anyway?

41:10.936 --> 41:12.035
Me? That was you!

41:12.037 --> 41:12.902
That was you!

41:12.904 --> 41:13.770
That was you!

41:13.772 --> 41:14.637
No it wasn't.

41:14.639 --> 41:15.672
I would never do that.

41:15.674 --> 41:16.673
I'm classy.

41:18.777 --> 41:21.010
Watch it, there's no guard
rails, so be careful.

41:21.012 --> 41:21.945
Where do we go?

41:21.947 --> 41:22.812
Where do we go?

41:22.814 --> 41:23.680
We go this way.

41:23.682 --> 41:24.614
Let's go.

41:26.885 --> 41:27.750
I won!

41:29.120 --> 41:30.487
What, you think I'm gonna
give you a medal or something?

41:30.489 --> 41:31.154
Yeah.

41:31.156 --> 41:32.255
Oh yeah?

41:41.833 --> 41:43.066
Okay, come one.

41:44.503 --> 41:45.502
Wait, wait, wait.

41:45.504 --> 41:46.236
No, no, no.

41:46.238 --> 41:47.103
Right here.

41:47.105 --> 41:48.171
- Oh.
- Yeah.

41:49.774 --> 41:51.808
You know what, let's
just get rid of this.

41:51.810 --> 41:53.276
Okay, easy tiger.

41:53.278 --> 41:55.211
Now who's the prude?

42:06.024 --> 42:07.857
It was probably just a deer.

42:07.859 --> 42:10.927
They're all over this fucking place.

42:17.102 --> 42:17.967
Here.

42:17.969 --> 42:19.168
I'll show you.

42:24.809 --> 42:25.742
Huh.

42:27.145 --> 42:29.078
She must be gone.

42:29.080 --> 42:30.680
She?

42:30.682 --> 42:34.050
Wouldn't that make her
a doe instead of a deer?

42:34.052 --> 42:35.084
What are you?

42:35.086 --> 42:37.120
Maria Von Trapp?

43:02.747 --> 43:03.780
No, wait.

43:04.816 --> 43:06.015
Okay.

43:26.705 --> 43:27.637
Hey.

43:30.709 --> 43:33.876
Do you have condoms and stuff?

43:33.878 --> 43:36.846
Yeah, I have everything.

43:36.848 --> 43:38.047
Give me a sec.

44:16.021 --> 44:16.953
Hello?

44:20.925 --> 44:23.159
What the?

44:28.299 --> 44:29.766
L?!

44:31.202 --> 44:34.871
I'm sorry, I thought
he was breaking in.

44:36.341 --> 44:37.674
Jesus!

44:37.676 --> 44:38.341
I didn't know.

44:38.343 --> 44:39.809
Hand me a towel.

44:39.811 --> 44:40.810
Fucking dead.

44:40.812 --> 44:42.178
All right.

44:42.180 --> 44:43.312
All right, keep your head
up, keep your head up.

44:43.314 --> 44:45.682
Pinch, pinch, pinch.

44:45.684 --> 44:46.382
Jeez.

44:46.384 --> 44:48.117
Help me get him up.

44:50.889 --> 44:51.821
All right.

44:54.225 --> 44:56.609
Watch your step.

44:56.610 --> 44:58.994
There's a step, there's
a step right there.

44:58.997 --> 45:00.229
Okay.

45:00.231 --> 45:01.230
All right.

45:01.232 --> 45:04.033
Watch the white pillows.

45:04.035 --> 45:04.967
Jesus.

45:06.971 --> 45:09.305
L, you gotta hold this
to your nose, all right?

45:09.307 --> 45:11.274
Hey, do you hear me?!

45:14.079 --> 45:15.211
Would you mind getting a bucket?

45:15.213 --> 45:16.145
Yeah.

45:23.922 --> 45:26.856
What the fuck is wrong with you?

46:14.339 --> 46:15.872
Hey.

46:15.874 --> 46:16.806
Sorry.

46:21.379 --> 46:22.478
Help me flip him on three.

46:22.480 --> 46:23.346
One.

46:23.348 --> 46:24.213
Two.

46:24.215 --> 46:25.148
Three.

46:26.317 --> 46:27.517
Okay.

46:27.519 --> 46:30.386
There's a bucket next to you, okay?

46:32.190 --> 46:33.089
Okay?

46:33.091 --> 46:35.091
Yeah.

46:38.930 --> 46:40.229
I'm so sorry.

46:41.499 --> 46:44.267
This is not your fault.

46:44.269 --> 46:47.203
He was supposed to go
home on the ferry today.

46:47.205 --> 46:48.538
Why didn't he?

46:50.408 --> 46:51.474
I don't...

46:57.081 --> 47:00.917
Listen, I'm just gonna
stay here for awhile,

47:00.919 --> 47:03.085
make sure he's okay.

47:03.087 --> 47:04.220
Yeah, sure.

47:09.861 --> 47:11.961
Goodnight, Joseph.

47:11.963 --> 47:13.029
Goodnight.

48:12.290 --> 48:13.489
Morning.

48:13.491 --> 48:16.893
I'm gonna get some coffee, do you?

48:16.895 --> 48:17.627
Right.

48:39.050 --> 48:43.252
I didn't think you two
would hit it off so well.

48:45.189 --> 48:46.355
Joseph, meet Rafael.

48:46.357 --> 48:47.623
Rafael, Joseph.

48:48.927 --> 48:49.659
We met.

48:50.628 --> 48:52.161
No we haven't.

48:53.064 --> 48:54.163
Last night.

48:55.099 --> 48:57.133
You might not remember.

48:58.569 --> 49:00.369
Who made the coffee?

49:01.205 --> 49:02.505
Your boy did.

49:04.208 --> 49:05.074
I'll get you some.

49:05.076 --> 49:07.143
No, you don't have to.

49:19.223 --> 49:20.156
What?

49:23.094 --> 49:24.360
I didn't know how you took it, so.

49:24.362 --> 49:26.362
Oh no, this is great.

49:33.137 --> 49:35.638
I hope you don't miss
your ferry again.

49:35.640 --> 49:38.407
Sorry you missed it last night.

49:42.747 --> 49:43.679
Mmmm.

49:43.681 --> 49:46.182
Yeah, I haven't decided yet.

49:46.184 --> 49:48.050
Haven't decided what?

49:48.052 --> 49:50.453
Might stay a little longer.

49:52.023 --> 49:54.590
You think that's a good idea?

49:54.592 --> 49:59.061
You know, with all your
work stuff going on.

49:59.063 --> 50:03.532
Anabi invited us to a
picnic if you wanna join us.

50:03.534 --> 50:07.737
Sorry, I meant to take
your mind off your breakup.

50:09.040 --> 50:11.007
Yeah, maybe you should.

50:11.009 --> 50:12.475
It might be good for you

50:12.477 --> 50:15.544
to be around other people, you know?

50:17.482 --> 50:19.548
You know what?

50:19.550 --> 50:21.150
Thank you.

50:21.152 --> 50:23.319
I'll see if I can make it.

50:36.434 --> 50:38.367
You made all this?

50:38.369 --> 50:39.568
Yeah.

50:39.570 --> 50:40.770
It's my thing.

50:42.040 --> 50:44.774
I thought Arabic was your thing.

50:44.776 --> 50:47.143
I have many things, my child.

50:52.517 --> 50:54.517
I found my I.D. last night.

50:54.519 --> 50:56.052
You did?

50:56.054 --> 50:57.586
I thought the guy who
mugged you took it.

50:57.588 --> 50:59.655
He did.

50:59.656 --> 51:01.723
I found it on the
floor here last night

51:01.726 --> 51:03.526
when Rafael came in.

51:08.099 --> 51:10.132
Did he find it somewhere?

51:10.134 --> 51:12.535
I don't know, I didn't ask.

51:14.539 --> 51:16.505
Well, it's great that you got it back.

51:16.507 --> 51:19.708
Be way less of a hassle for going out.

51:20.645 --> 51:21.577
Yeah.

51:22.847 --> 51:25.314
I just wonder how he got it, you know?

51:25.316 --> 51:28.517
It's not something a mugger
would just casually drop.

51:28.519 --> 51:29.418
You know?

51:31.522 --> 51:33.355
What're you suggesting?

51:33.357 --> 51:34.690
Nothing.

51:34.692 --> 51:37.726
You're meeting him at a weird time

51:39.664 --> 51:41.230
but I'm sure there's
a logical explanation

51:41.232 --> 51:42.231
for how he found it.

51:42.233 --> 51:43.365
Yeah, sure.

51:45.636 --> 51:47.703
It seems to me

51:47.705 --> 51:49.572
I owe you an apology.

51:50.708 --> 51:54.176
We got interrupted
last night, I think.

51:56.247 --> 51:57.346
Yes we did.

51:59.350 --> 52:01.884
Do you remember where we left off?

52:01.886 --> 52:04.420
I think you were going
over to get condoms.

52:04.422 --> 52:05.354
No.

52:08.126 --> 52:09.859
Condoms and "stuff."

52:54.939 --> 52:56.539
What?

52:56.541 --> 52:58.774
I can't believe
I kicked him last night.

52:58.776 --> 53:01.577
I've never kicked anyone before.

53:02.847 --> 53:07.516
And you said
you couldn't be in the army.

53:08.352 --> 53:09.652
How'd you guys meet?

53:09.654 --> 53:10.920
Rafael?

53:10.922 --> 53:12.721
We grew up together.

53:15.259 --> 53:18.427
He was the only one who knew.

53:18.429 --> 53:19.762
For the longest.

53:22.900 --> 53:24.833
He helped me come out.

53:25.970 --> 53:28.871
Talked me through my
first relationship

53:28.873 --> 53:30.806
and it's terrible end.

53:34.278 --> 53:36.612
We were scared and young but

53:38.349 --> 53:40.349
we had each other.

53:40.351 --> 53:41.283
You know?

53:43.487 --> 53:45.287
I wish I had that.

53:46.490 --> 53:47.756
I mean,

53:47.758 --> 53:49.959
I know it's better now but

53:52.430 --> 53:53.896
I only had my mom.

53:55.666 --> 53:58.300
Never really talked about it.

54:00.404 --> 54:02.671
Now she's just obsessed
with me getting married.

54:07.311 --> 54:11.280
You don't have like a
best friend or anything?

54:22.893 --> 54:24.360
If we had met the normal way

54:24.362 --> 54:26.829
would we still have hooked up?

54:28.332 --> 54:31.400
Your little insecurity is so cute.

54:32.803 --> 54:34.270
I'm not insecure.

54:34.272 --> 54:35.504
Mm-hmm.

54:35.506 --> 54:37.840
I'm not, I'm just curious.

54:39.744 --> 54:40.676
Well,

54:41.646 --> 54:42.745
probably not.

54:46.284 --> 54:49.718
Because I don't really
do random hookups.

54:57.995 --> 54:59.762
I'm not insecure.

55:01.032 --> 55:02.898
I just don't want people
to have power over me

55:02.900 --> 55:04.300
because of it.

55:07.438 --> 55:09.004
What do you mean?

55:10.308 --> 55:13.942
I remember a few years
ago at the pride parade,

55:13.944 --> 55:17.046
a bunch of corporate
floats started to appear

55:17.048 --> 55:19.782
and part of me was
relieved that they were

55:19.784 --> 55:21.717
finally pandering to us.

55:21.719 --> 55:24.486
Yeah, for your disposable income.

55:24.488 --> 55:25.421
Still.

55:26.490 --> 55:29.591
I remember a group starting booing

55:29.593 --> 55:32.661
and chanting, "Bull
shit," or whatever.

55:32.663 --> 55:34.863
They were pissed they had lost their

55:34.865 --> 55:35.798
half-naked

55:36.934 --> 55:39.335
leather drag queen parade.

55:43.374 --> 55:45.441
I was so pissed at them.

55:46.477 --> 55:49.578
They didn't understand
what this meant.

55:49.580 --> 55:52.448
We wouldn't be outsiders anymore.

55:59.090 --> 56:02.758
Acceptance doesn't
end maltreatment though.

56:02.760 --> 56:03.959
That's not what I'm saying.

56:03.961 --> 56:05.627
You are.

56:05.629 --> 56:06.829
No, I'm not.

56:06.831 --> 56:12.768
If you allow some existential
fear to dictate your life,

56:13.504 --> 56:14.703
it makes you the prey,

56:16.440 --> 56:18.974
whether you're accepted or not.

56:30.921 --> 56:34.590
You got this all
figured out, don't you?

56:36.594 --> 56:38.627
Don't get mad.

56:38.629 --> 56:39.828
I'm not mad.

56:40.831 --> 56:42.164
You sound mad.

56:43.701 --> 56:46.568
You just called me weak.

56:46.570 --> 56:48.737
I was talking within the context...

56:48.739 --> 56:49.738
Whatever.

56:59.150 --> 57:02.618
I would've at least flirted with you.

57:03.521 --> 57:04.920
Nice back-peddling.

57:04.922 --> 57:06.021
Mm-hmm.

57:06.023 --> 57:07.623
Is it working?

57:07.625 --> 57:08.557
Uh uh.

57:13.597 --> 57:14.530
Hey.

57:16.834 --> 57:18.066
Oh, you son of a...

57:19.003 --> 57:21.170
No, no, I have the glass.

57:47.631 --> 57:48.964
Hey!

57:58.476 --> 57:59.208
Fuck.

58:49.226 --> 58:51.793
You guys want a refill?

58:51.795 --> 58:54.096
When do you wanna leave?

58:54.098 --> 58:56.164
As soon as L gets back.

58:56.166 --> 58:58.934
Oh, he's finally going to emerge

58:58.936 --> 59:01.937
from his mopey break-up cocoon?

59:01.939 --> 59:03.539
Relax.

59:03.541 --> 59:06.108
Why, you wanna go put on
a jockstrap just in case?

59:06.110 --> 59:07.910
At least I have a jock strap.

59:07.912 --> 59:09.044
I think he just went to the beach.

59:09.914 --> 59:11.680
Speak of the devil.

59:16.820 --> 59:17.753
L?

59:28.933 --> 59:30.799
I fucking texted you.

59:32.069 --> 59:34.970
L, if you're gonna be here,
you need to act normal.

59:34.972 --> 59:36.705
Here's chips and salsa, see?

59:36.707 --> 59:37.639
Normal.

59:38.809 --> 59:40.609
What're you doing?

59:42.780 --> 59:44.580
Hey, I asked you something.

59:44.582 --> 59:46.014
I found his stuff.

59:46.016 --> 59:46.982
Who's stuff?

59:46.984 --> 59:48.116
Someone was watching us!

59:48.118 --> 59:49.051
Hey!

59:49.053 --> 59:51.587
Keep your fucking voice down.

59:55.793 --> 59:57.593
What're you talking about?

59:57.595 --> 59:59.094
Someone was hiding in the bushes.

59:59.096 --> 01:00:00.963
I saw them run off and
when I went back just now,

01:00:03.133 --> 01:00:04.016
I found this.

01:00:04.017 --> 01:00:04.900
People hook in the
Meat Rack all the time.

01:00:04.902 --> 01:00:08.103
How do you know that belongs to the...

01:00:13.344 --> 01:00:15.877
This could belong to anyone.

01:00:19.883 --> 01:00:21.049
L, you need to leave.

01:00:21.051 --> 01:00:22.250
Not yet, I have to make sure...

01:00:22.252 --> 01:00:25.354
No, you're acting
like a fucking lunatic!

01:00:25.356 --> 01:00:26.755
Going back there night after night,

01:00:26.757 --> 01:00:29.658
you're gonna incriminate yourself.

01:00:31.862 --> 01:00:35.297
There hasn't been a
crime yet, remember?

01:00:36.834 --> 01:00:38.400
The longer you're here,

01:00:38.402 --> 01:00:42.170
the sooner you're gonna get arrested.

01:00:42.172 --> 01:00:43.372
Or both of us.

01:00:47.911 --> 01:00:49.945
You guys ready?

01:00:49.947 --> 01:00:52.848
Yeah, we'll be out in a minute.

01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:55.183
Why do I feel like I
just walked into a fight?

01:00:55.185 --> 01:00:56.818
Would you mind taking these?

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:58.320
Put them in the bag?

01:00:58.322 --> 01:00:59.254
Sure.

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:01.023
Sorry.

01:01:09.667 --> 01:01:12.668
I'm not leaving until I find him.

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:15.737
And what's gonna happen if you do?

01:01:17.708 --> 01:01:19.441
We're leaving tonight,

01:01:20.911 --> 01:01:25.147
if I have to drag your drunk
ass out of here myself.

01:01:36.694 --> 01:01:38.126
Yeah, I'm literally on a salt diet.

01:01:38.128 --> 01:01:39.194
Only salt.

01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:40.328
- Really?
- It's working.

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:41.997
- Wow.
- Yeah.

01:01:41.999 --> 01:01:44.866
Oh my God, Cam, are you
ready to go or what?

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:45.967
Actually, they need
some help in there.

01:01:45.969 --> 01:01:48.270
Could make yourself useful?

01:01:49.773 --> 01:01:50.972
Okay, bossy.

01:01:56.814 --> 01:01:57.479
Hey.

01:01:57.481 --> 01:01:58.413
Hey.

01:02:00.217 --> 01:02:01.116
Listen,

01:02:03.253 --> 01:02:06.054
we have to leave tonight.

01:02:06.056 --> 01:02:07.456
I'm sorry.

01:02:07.458 --> 01:02:11.126
Work came up and we
have to head back, so,

01:02:12.029 --> 01:02:13.829
you should probably.

01:02:14.965 --> 01:02:16.231
Oh.

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:17.466
I'm sorry.

01:02:17.468 --> 01:02:18.467
I really...

01:02:20.471 --> 01:02:22.003
No, it's cool.

01:02:24.875 --> 01:02:27.142
I can give you some
money to cover your ferry,

01:02:27.144 --> 01:02:28.810
get you home okay.

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.114
Are you headed right back to D.C.?

01:02:32.116 --> 01:02:34.216
Let's go, boys!

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:16.925
Water damage.

01:03:16.927 --> 01:03:18.960
Yeah, it won't turn on.

01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:22.097
It was a long shot.

01:03:22.099 --> 01:03:23.398
You ready?

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:24.299
Yeah.

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:25.233
Yeah.

01:03:26.303 --> 01:03:27.969
Hey.

01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:31.006
I'm sorry I snapped at you earlier.

01:03:33.343 --> 01:03:38.413
You know you're the closet
thing I have to family, right?

01:03:38.916 --> 01:03:40.482
Yeah.

01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:42.049
I would never do anything to hurt you.

01:03:42.052 --> 01:03:43.518
I know.

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:45.453
We're in this together.

01:03:45.455 --> 01:03:46.354
Yeah.

01:03:47.558 --> 01:03:48.557
Coming with us?

01:03:48.559 --> 01:03:49.491
Yeah.

01:03:49.493 --> 01:03:51.827
Yeah, I'll meet you there.

01:04:01.305 --> 01:04:02.938
Hey,

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:03.471
I could have someone take
a look at that phone for...

01:04:03.473 --> 01:04:05.040
I got it.

01:04:05.042 --> 01:04:06.908
Don't worry about it.

01:04:30.334 --> 01:04:34.269
And that is how Fire
Island got its name.

01:04:34.271 --> 01:04:35.403
It's true.

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:39.040
I heard that there used to be a pirate

01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:40.408
that inhabited the island

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:44.045
and he made his living
by pillaging booty.

01:04:44.047 --> 01:04:46.548
What kind of booty?

01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:49.084
He would find a
shallow area in the break

01:04:49.086 --> 01:04:53.355
and stick these large wooden
shafts into the ocean floor.

01:04:53.357 --> 01:04:55.490
Oh, my kind of weekend.

01:04:56.393 --> 01:04:58.026
But it's true.

01:04:58.028 --> 01:04:59.394
In the pitch dark of night,

01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:01.329
he would build these huge
bonfires on the beach

01:05:01.331 --> 01:05:04.165
that could be seen
for miles and miles.

01:05:04.167 --> 01:05:07.435
Passing ships would see the
fires and think it was an SOS,

01:05:07.437 --> 01:05:10.472
so they would run-aground,
not realizing that their ships

01:05:10.474 --> 01:05:13.441
were about to get
stuck on those poles.

01:05:13.443 --> 01:05:14.676
And so,

01:05:14.678 --> 01:05:16.511
when the crews would make it to shore,

01:05:16.513 --> 01:05:18.680
the pirate would appear out of nowhere

01:05:18.682 --> 01:05:22.951
and slaughter them all,
before looting the ships.

01:05:22.953 --> 01:05:24.519
Oh, I keep going to sleep, oh my God.

01:05:24.521 --> 01:05:26.554
To this day, it's called Fire Island

01:05:26.556 --> 01:05:30.358
because of those fires, a false SOS.

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:31.559
How is this a ghost story?

01:05:31.561 --> 01:05:33.428
You didn't say "ghost story,"

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:35.297
you said "scary story."

01:05:35.299 --> 01:05:38.066
And it wasn't even scary, R.L. Stine!

01:05:38.068 --> 01:05:40.035
I like the lesbian pirates better.

01:05:40.037 --> 01:05:41.469
Hey, Cam?

01:05:41.471 --> 01:05:42.404
Cameroon?

01:05:42.406 --> 01:05:46.207
I hate to whine but can
you give me some red?

01:05:46.209 --> 01:05:47.509
It's all the way back at the house.

01:05:47.511 --> 01:05:49.077
You can get it yourself.

01:05:49.079 --> 01:05:50.946
You're already up, so.

01:05:50.948 --> 01:05:53.181
So what, that makes me a little bitch?

01:05:53.183 --> 01:05:54.049
No.

01:05:54.051 --> 01:05:55.550
What?

01:05:55.552 --> 01:05:56.651
I can go.

01:05:56.653 --> 01:05:58.486
I need to pee anyways.

01:05:58.488 --> 01:05:59.487
Awww, see?

01:05:59.489 --> 01:06:01.256
Gay Chivalry isn't dead.

01:06:01.258 --> 01:06:02.958
Thanks sweetie.

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:03.692
You know where everything is?

01:06:03.694 --> 01:06:04.626
Yeah.

01:06:04.628 --> 01:06:06.227
I can manage without you.

01:06:06.229 --> 01:06:09.097
I'm so bored with these snacks.

01:06:10.133 --> 01:06:11.366
Did I ever tell you guys

01:06:11.368 --> 01:06:14.002
about how the Back End got its name?

01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:16.071
So,

01:06:16.974 --> 01:06:19.307
L came out of his cave, huh?

01:06:21.511 --> 01:06:24.512
Did he talk to you
about Marcus at all?

01:06:24.514 --> 01:06:25.647
Not really.

01:06:26.717 --> 01:06:29.050
You know what happened?

01:06:45.769 --> 01:06:47.369
Hey.

01:06:47.371 --> 01:06:49.504
Sorry, did I scare you?

01:06:49.506 --> 01:06:50.438
No.

01:06:52.275 --> 01:06:55.543
They need some booze too, so
I thought I'd come help out.

01:06:55.545 --> 01:06:56.478
Okay.

01:07:00.317 --> 01:07:03.385
So, you gonna let me in or?

01:07:03.387 --> 01:07:04.586
Yeah, sorry.

01:07:08.158 --> 01:07:09.090
You know,

01:07:12.562 --> 01:07:16.464
I feel like we got
off on the wrong foot.

01:07:16.466 --> 01:07:18.666
I know you're really important to Cam

01:07:18.668 --> 01:07:22.137
and, again, I'm sorry
about last night.

01:07:24.441 --> 01:07:25.373
Me too.

01:07:26.576 --> 01:07:29.344
Did you get your I.D.
back, by the way?

01:07:29.346 --> 01:07:30.445
I did.

01:07:30.447 --> 01:07:31.379
Thank you.

01:07:44.294 --> 01:07:45.827
You okay?

01:07:58.608 --> 01:08:02.143
I thought Marcus left yesterday.

01:08:02.145 --> 01:08:03.344
He did, why?

01:08:04.714 --> 01:08:07.248
Jean was saying that he
didn't come into work today.

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:09.451
That's kinda weird, right?

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:17.826
He and L broke up.

01:08:19.496 --> 01:08:21.830
Oh my God, like seriously?

01:08:21.832 --> 01:08:25.233
So I'm guessing he took the day off.

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:27.635
Oh, they ended their engagement here?

01:08:27.636 --> 01:08:29.237
During this trip?

01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:31.272
Fuck.

01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:34.642
That's so weird.

01:08:34.644 --> 01:08:37.479
Why wouldn't they tell any of us?

01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:45.854
I think they just wanted some privacy.

01:08:45.856 --> 01:08:47.421
Well,

01:08:47.424 --> 01:08:50.792
I guess that explains
why L's been such a dick.

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:07.308
Remind me, again, what
you do for a living.

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:08.676
I'm a lawyer.

01:09:08.678 --> 01:09:10.678
Do you like it?

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:11.613
I do.

01:09:12.582 --> 01:09:13.848
Criminal law?

01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:17.417
No.

01:09:21.291 --> 01:09:25.627
Do you consider yourself
an honest person, Joseph?

01:09:27.898 --> 01:09:29.731
Lawyer's don't have a
reputation of being honest,

01:09:29.733 --> 01:09:33.600
but yes, yes, I do consider
myself an honest person.

01:09:33.603 --> 01:09:34.536
Why?

01:09:35.839 --> 01:09:38.473
Because I think you're lying to me.

01:09:38.475 --> 01:09:41.276
I think you're hiding something.

01:09:42.412 --> 01:09:43.545
I found this.

01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:48.649
Is that yours?

01:09:51.388 --> 01:09:52.787
- No.
- No?

01:09:52.788 --> 01:09:53.720
Huh.

01:09:55.325 --> 01:09:56.858
That's weird because

01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:58.860
I found this in there too.

01:10:08.738 --> 01:10:12.240
You didn't see where L went, did you?

01:10:13.476 --> 01:10:15.543
Maybe he's taking a sand dump.

01:10:15.545 --> 01:10:16.644
I'm serious.

01:10:18.815 --> 01:10:20.281
I don't know.

01:10:31.228 --> 01:10:31.960
L!

01:10:35.765 --> 01:10:37.265
- What do you want?
- I wanna know

01:10:37.267 --> 01:10:40.235
why you turned my best
friend against me.

01:10:40.237 --> 01:10:40.902
I, I, I...

01:10:40.904 --> 01:10:42.503
Stop fucking lying!

01:10:42.505 --> 01:10:44.405
You lied about your clothes,
you lied about your phone!

01:10:44.407 --> 01:10:45.573
You're a fucking liar!

01:10:45.575 --> 01:10:47.475
- I told you everything.
- No, no, no.

01:10:47.477 --> 01:10:49.611
This is what's gonna fucking happen.

01:10:49.613 --> 01:10:52.947
You're gonna leave
tonight on the next ferry

01:10:52.949 --> 01:10:53.915
and you're gonna take the first train

01:10:53.917 --> 01:10:56.017
back to your lonely little life

01:10:56.019 --> 01:10:58.886
and you're never gonna
speak about this again.

01:10:58.888 --> 01:10:59.988
What you did,

01:11:01.024 --> 01:11:02.290
who you met,

01:11:02.926 --> 01:11:04.025
what you saw.

01:11:05.495 --> 01:11:08.830
Like a little lying
lawyer that you are.

01:11:10.333 --> 01:11:12.567
Because if you do,

01:11:12.569 --> 01:11:13.501
I'll know.

01:11:14.537 --> 01:11:17.405
I will find you and I will kill you.

01:11:18.441 --> 01:11:20.541
All right, Joseph?

01:11:20.543 --> 01:11:21.976
All right?

01:11:21.978 --> 01:11:23.044
All right.

01:11:26.916 --> 01:11:28.750
I won't say anything.

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:33.388
I know you won't.

01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:34.756
Cowards never do.

01:11:38.295 --> 01:11:40.328
Is that what you said about Marcus?

01:12:05.655 --> 01:12:06.721
Get off him!

01:12:06.723 --> 01:12:07.655
L!

01:12:13.463 --> 01:12:14.862
Hey, wake up.

01:12:14.864 --> 01:12:15.797
Hey!

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:18.433
Joseph.

01:12:19.536 --> 01:12:20.501
Oh my God.

01:12:24.541 --> 01:12:26.474
Looks like you're waking
up, it's all right.

01:12:26.476 --> 01:12:27.709
Back up, L!

01:12:27.711 --> 01:12:28.976
His eye's open.

01:12:28.978 --> 01:12:29.911
We have to leave!

01:12:29.913 --> 01:12:30.912
What the fuck are you gonna do?

01:12:32.549 --> 01:12:35.350
He can't see what's going on.

01:12:35.352 --> 01:12:37.352
Let me fucking deal with this.

01:14:11.114 --> 01:14:12.580
Are you hurt?

01:14:15.919 --> 01:14:17.718
I know you're awake.

01:14:49.586 --> 01:14:51.719
I'm not a bad person.

01:14:51.721 --> 01:14:55.189
I've done some bad
things but I'm not bad.

01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:59.594
You have to understand.

01:14:59.596 --> 01:15:04.065
Everything that could go
wrong in a person's life

01:15:04.067 --> 01:15:06.000
has gone wrong in his.

01:15:08.638 --> 01:15:10.104
And then Marcus...

01:15:14.744 --> 01:15:17.778
But he's been there for me.

01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:18.713
So...

01:15:23.119 --> 01:15:25.186
I'm gonna fix this.

01:15:25.188 --> 01:15:26.988
I can figure it out.

01:15:32.929 --> 01:15:37.932
If I take the duct tape off,
you promise not to yell again?

01:15:44.674 --> 01:15:46.307
Please, Cam, let me go.

01:15:46.309 --> 01:15:48.109
I can't do that.

01:15:48.111 --> 01:15:50.211
Please, you can.

01:15:50.213 --> 01:15:51.279
You're gonna tell.

01:15:51.281 --> 01:15:52.680
