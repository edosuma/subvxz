00:02.521 --> 00:06.361
Today, we bring the true horror
of nuclear capability

00:06.442 --> 00:08.282
to the heart of the UN itself.

00:08.300 --> 00:09.980
What's the deactivation code?

00:10.100 --> 00:11.100
Nice knowing you, Mikey.

00:11.220 --> 00:13.020
You have Li-Na?

00:13.180 --> 00:16.379
Bring her in and I'll personally make
sure that Section 20 is reinstated.

00:16.500 --> 00:17.860
What the hell are they doing here?

00:18.980 --> 00:20.040
Urgh!

00:20.060 --> 00:21.220
No!

00:22.900 --> 00:24.140
Argh!

00:27.580 --> 00:29.300
The shit! Shit!

00:57.500 --> 00:58.780
Argh...!

01:03.300 --> 01:04.500
Scott?

01:15.500 --> 01:16.700
Scott!

01:16.820 --> 01:18.020
Yeah!

01:19.340 --> 01:20.400
I'm fine.

01:21.500 --> 01:22.560
Urgh...

01:28.860 --> 01:31.180
They're going to be looking for us.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.700
We can't leave his body here, Mike.

01:32.860 --> 01:35.220
Scott, we don't have a choice.
We have to move on.

01:35.340 --> 01:37.940
Well... They're going to be coming.

01:38.060 --> 01:40.100
I lost my gun. Ammo count?

01:45.580 --> 01:47.540
I got two. One up.

01:47.700 --> 01:50.820
It's enough. Three rounds isn't
enough, not if you want to survive.

01:50.980 --> 01:52.820
I'm not talking about survival,
Mike.

01:52.940 --> 01:54.940
I'm talking about getting even.

01:55.060 --> 01:56.460
You want to get even? Yeah!

01:56.620 --> 02:00.180
Then let's get smart
and let's move out.

02:00.300 --> 02:01.320
Come on.

02:57.980 --> 03:01.180
All right, listen up!
We're coming up to the crash site.

03:01.300 --> 03:02.980
Eyes on the prize.

03:04.180 --> 03:06.500
First blood gets a bonus
in their paycheck.

03:13.940 --> 03:15.860
Do you know what your problem is,
Mike?

03:16.020 --> 03:17.580
You're still thinking
like a soldier.

03:17.740 --> 03:19.740
You stand tall,
salute the fucking flag.

03:19.940 --> 03:22.940
My problem is
you'd happily get us killed
without thinking things through.

03:23.100 --> 03:24.740
What's there to think through,
Michael?

03:24.900 --> 03:26.940
They murdered the boss.
You happy about that?

03:27.100 --> 03:29.460
You think I'm happy about that?
I'm trying to keep us alive!

03:29.660 --> 03:31.540
What, by running
like a pair of fucking cowards?

03:31.700 --> 03:34.780
Call me a coward one more time,
mate, see how that fucking works out
for you!

03:38.980 --> 03:41.460
What would he say
about our situation?

03:41.620 --> 03:43.820
What would the boss say?
Shut up, Michael!

03:55.340 --> 03:57.300
He'd tell us to stop
shouting at each other

03:57.460 --> 04:00.300
like a couple of schoolgirls.
He'd say we're outnumbered.

04:02.020 --> 04:03.740
We need an escape route.

04:05.980 --> 04:07.540
Passports.

04:07.660 --> 04:09.060
Cash.

04:10.380 --> 04:13.980
He'd tell us three bullets
weren't nearly enough.

04:15.340 --> 04:18.220
That's pretty much
the way I see it, too.

04:18.339 --> 04:20.940
Problem is, we can't go for backup.

04:21.100 --> 04:23.980
The CIA have hidden weapon caches
all over Europe.

04:24.100 --> 04:25.820
What are you thinking?

04:25.940 --> 04:28.500
We need to find a phone.

04:28.620 --> 04:30.260
Well, let's find a phone, then, eh?

04:32.100 --> 04:33.420
Yes, sir.

04:42.060 --> 04:44.340
Almost touching. Yeah.

04:44.460 --> 04:46.820
Think I might cry.

04:48.700 --> 04:50.540
We got a trail over here.

04:50.660 --> 04:52.860
Yeah, got one here, too.

04:53.020 --> 04:55.780
Fake trails.
They're trying to mislead us.

04:55.940 --> 04:59.140
Check every town,
every home within a ten-mile radius.

04:59.300 --> 05:03.020
Need be, we'll go door-to-door
using our considerable charm.

05:16.620 --> 05:17.900
Telephone...

05:27.740 --> 05:29.580
Excuse me...

05:29.740 --> 05:31.540
Excuse me!

05:31.700 --> 05:34.140
Hello?
Hey.

05:34.300 --> 05:39.140
Sorry, we're a little lost and, er,
we had an accident.

05:39.300 --> 05:42.540
So, have you got a telephone
that we can use?

05:42.660 --> 05:44.780
What do the Swiss call a telephone?

05:44.900 --> 05:47.380
They call it a telephone.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.500
But I'm not Swiss. I'm Austrian.

05:50.820 --> 05:53.300
Er, we also call it a telephone.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.580
The telephone is back there.

06:00.700 --> 06:01.940
Thank you.

06:09.140 --> 06:11.860
Oscar Steiner.
Michael Stonebridge.

06:11.980 --> 06:13.820
And that's Damien Scott.

06:13.980 --> 06:16.980
Army?
Yes. And you?

06:20.580 --> 06:22.740
Look, er...

06:22.860 --> 06:24.100
I need your help.

06:24.260 --> 06:28.180
Second Lieutenant,
Austrian infantry.

06:29.540 --> 06:30.900
In the photo?

06:32.100 --> 06:33.940
Er, that was my father.

06:34.100 --> 06:38.220
He fought in the Gebirgsjager
in the Second World War.

06:39.420 --> 06:40.900
Do excuse me, please.

06:41.020 --> 06:42.420
Yeah.

06:42.540 --> 06:44.820
Any luck?

06:44.980 --> 06:48.180
Yeah. But you're not going
to like it. Christy Bryant.

06:48.340 --> 06:50.940
What? She was my handler
for seven years, Mike.

06:51.100 --> 06:53.980
Scott, you also tried to shoot her
once or twice, didn't you? Once.

06:54.100 --> 06:55.500
Huh?

06:55.620 --> 06:57.020
All right, maybe twice. Yeah.

06:57.180 --> 06:59.540
The point is,
she's running PMCs in Europe.

06:59.700 --> 07:02.380
She's going to RV with us
at a safe house,

07:02.500 --> 07:05.340
where she can get us cash, passports

07:05.500 --> 07:08.860
and she can confirm the location of
the CIA weapons cache close to here.

07:08.980 --> 07:10.180
That's good.

07:12.540 --> 07:14.140
Excuse me, sir.

07:14.260 --> 07:16.980
Have you heard of the Friedhof Dam?

07:17.100 --> 07:18.300
Yes.

07:18.420 --> 07:21.020
It's about 50km from here.

07:21.140 --> 07:23.420
We're going to need to rest.

07:23.580 --> 07:27.460
Oscar, may we please stay
for a while, rest up?

07:27.620 --> 07:31.380
We have no money, but we can offer
you this. It's worth something.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.220
I live in Switzerland.

07:33.380 --> 07:37.020
I'm surrounded by watches.
Thank you.

07:37.140 --> 07:38.420
Please...

07:39.900 --> 07:41.580
Cheers. Thank you.

08:14.460 --> 08:18.020
How long have you been in the army?

08:18.140 --> 08:20.180
Since the day I left school.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.700
So everything you know in life...

08:24.140 --> 08:28.140
..it is because you are a soldier.

08:28.260 --> 08:29.220
Hm.

08:32.140 --> 08:34.260
Have a family?

08:34.380 --> 08:35.820
Have a home?

08:37.860 --> 08:39.220
I had a wife.

08:42.780 --> 08:44.580
I would have been a father.

08:47.780 --> 08:50.180
I think things
would have been different.

08:51.460 --> 08:55.020
There's a world in which Michael
Stonebridge is fixing the fence

08:55.140 --> 08:57.380
and he's arguing with his missus

08:57.540 --> 08:59.380
and the kids are running around
the garden

08:59.540 --> 09:01.580
and they're driving him nuts
and he...

09:04.940 --> 09:07.260
..he loves every second of it.

09:07.420 --> 09:09.620
Because he's found his place
in the world.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.340
But that is not real.

09:14.460 --> 09:15.820
No, it's not.

09:17.900 --> 09:19.220
That didn't happen.

09:22.940 --> 09:25.460
I can't even imagine
that world any more.

09:25.580 --> 09:27.540
And I'm almost...

09:27.660 --> 09:30.460
I'm almost grateful,

09:30.620 --> 09:33.660
because I don't have to love
or care for anyone.

09:33.780 --> 09:35.540
I don't have to share anything.

09:36.860 --> 09:39.460
This is all I have.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.580
But there is a problem.

09:43.620 --> 09:48.140
You and him walking here...

09:49.700 --> 09:51.460
..the state you're in,

09:51.580 --> 09:53.580
there is trouble.

09:55.700 --> 09:58.580
Yeah. Yeah, there's trouble.

09:58.700 --> 10:00.460
You are scared?

10:00.580 --> 10:02.060
No, I'm not scared.

10:03.740 --> 10:05.660
And part of me hopes
I die a soldier,

10:05.820 --> 10:08.860
because without this life,
I'm... nothing.

10:12.300 --> 10:15.260
This is all I have.
This is all that I am.

10:17.860 --> 10:19.260
Life...

10:20.340 --> 10:22.020
..it is not so bad.

10:22.180 --> 10:26.620
But wherever you are,
maybe you have to get old...

10:28.020 --> 10:30.380
..before you can see that.

10:56.020 --> 10:58.700
This is to a man that we just lost.

10:58.820 --> 11:00.860
Lieutenant Colonel Philip Locke.

11:00.980 --> 11:02.660
To the boss.

11:14.300 --> 11:15.860
We leave at first light.

11:23.135 --> 11:25.535
This was my father's.

11:25.655 --> 11:27.615
It might be useful to you.

11:28.695 --> 11:30.855
Huh! A stick grenade.

11:32.415 --> 11:33.655
Oh.

11:35.135 --> 11:37.815
Are you sure?
I sleep good at night.

11:39.175 --> 11:41.495
That has no use for me.

11:44.818 --> 11:46.098
Nice.

11:46.130 --> 11:47.450
Bloody hell!

11:48.930 --> 11:51.610
Er, no. No way.

11:52.850 --> 11:54.170
She's beautiful.

12:03.530 --> 12:05.450
You in?

12:05.570 --> 12:07.450
Thank you very much.

12:07.570 --> 12:08.930
Thank you, Oscar.

12:37.450 --> 12:40.570
Ah... It looks like an old helmet.

12:40.690 --> 12:42.250
Ah-ha!

12:42.370 --> 12:44.490
Here, Mikey.

12:44.610 --> 12:46.010
Look...

12:46.170 --> 12:49.490
There you go. Now I'm comfortable.
That's perfect.

13:35.290 --> 13:36.770
Good day, sir.

13:36.890 --> 13:39.410
Have you had two men pass by here?

13:39.530 --> 13:42.530
I'm sorry, nobody visit me.

13:42.650 --> 13:44.530
Not for long time.

13:55.970 --> 13:59.050
Please understand that the men
we're looking for,

13:59.170 --> 14:00.930
despite what they may have told you,

14:01.050 --> 14:02.890
they're wanted criminals.

14:03.050 --> 14:06.530
And by protecting them,
you ain't helping no-one.

14:06.650 --> 14:09.130
I'm going to make you a promise here.

14:09.290 --> 14:12.570
Tell me what they wanted,
where they are,

14:12.690 --> 14:14.370
we'll leave you be.

14:14.490 --> 14:17.370
No harm, no fail.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.570
They are soldiers.

14:19.690 --> 14:21.290
We're soldiers, too.

14:21.410 --> 14:24.050
You're something else.

14:24.170 --> 14:25.810
Something worse.

14:30.730 --> 14:32.410
It doesn't matter.

14:32.530 --> 14:34.450
I am not going to help you.

14:35.610 --> 14:38.610
What is it you guys always say?

14:38.730 --> 14:42.850
Ve haz vays of making you talk!

14:42.970 --> 14:44.570
I am Austrian.

14:44.690 --> 14:46.650
Well, pardon me to hell!

14:46.770 --> 14:48.730
You just ruined my joke.

14:48.890 --> 14:51.410
But I ain't going to let you fuck up
my punchline, though!

14:52.850 --> 14:54.810
Smile...

14:54.930 --> 14:57.890
Argh! Argh! Argh! Aarrgghh!

14:58.010 --> 14:59.210
Argh! Argh!

15:10.770 --> 15:13.570
We'll get tooled up here. We'll
be at our rendezvous by nightfall.

15:13.690 --> 15:14.730
Copy that.

15:33.370 --> 15:35.090
God bless America!

15:35.210 --> 15:36.650
And Christy Bryant!

15:40.690 --> 15:42.210
How are we doing?

15:42.330 --> 15:43.850
It's not working very well.

15:45.530 --> 15:47.930
It's pretty wet. Give me a minute.

15:55.650 --> 15:57.650
We might have company.

15:57.770 --> 15:59.010
Shit.

16:00.130 --> 16:02.450
Yeah, that's one confirmed.
Bollocks!

16:09.730 --> 16:12.450
Shit. We've got two confirmed.
We need those guns, Scott.

16:12.570 --> 16:14.650
Yeah, I know. I'm working on it.

16:17.570 --> 16:19.770
It's disconnected. Shit.

16:19.890 --> 16:21.250
There's two more.

16:24.050 --> 16:25.850
How long have I got?

16:25.970 --> 16:27.290
Not long.

16:29.010 --> 16:32.050
We're going to have to make a call,
the guns or we move.

16:33.610 --> 16:36.650
High five.
Let's open it up, come on.

16:48.450 --> 16:49.770
Gone...

16:54.570 --> 16:56.610
Mike! What?

16:56.770 --> 16:59.690
There's nothing here, Mike.
It's fucking empty.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.490
Shit. Are you sure?

17:01.610 --> 17:03.410
There's nothing. Bollocks!

17:03.530 --> 17:04.609
Damn!

17:13.250 --> 17:14.970
Dammit!

17:15.089 --> 17:16.329
I can't believe that.

17:17.690 --> 17:19.410
All right, pros...

17:19.569 --> 17:21.849
We've got great cover
and we know they're coming.

17:21.970 --> 17:23.290
Cons...

17:23.410 --> 17:25.329
Inferior firepower.

17:25.490 --> 17:28.369
My three bullets
and your antique handgun.

17:29.970 --> 17:32.050
You got a plan, Michael?

17:33.410 --> 17:35.130
Yeah, I've got a fucking plan.

17:59.810 --> 18:01.810
Great fucking plan!

18:03.690 --> 18:05.690
Er, you got a better one?

18:06.730 --> 18:07.790
Yeah!

18:51.610 --> 18:53.170
Go! Go! Go!

19:09.930 --> 19:11.490
It was a cunning plan!

19:16.730 --> 19:17.790
Urgh!

19:19.970 --> 19:21.290
Moving!

19:24.650 --> 19:26.090
Move! Move! Move!

19:26.210 --> 19:27.610
Mikey! New plan!

19:59.210 --> 20:01.170
Beans and motherfuckers.

20:27.330 --> 20:30.210
Mate, we've got to keep moving!
Mike...

20:31.530 --> 20:33.890
May have to switch to plan B.
Shit!

20:36.890 --> 20:38.210
Can you walk?

20:38.330 --> 20:39.810
Come on, get up.

20:44.459 --> 20:46.419
Keep pressure on that, OK? Yeah.

20:51.139 --> 20:53.499
You know, statistically,
most battlefield deaths

20:53.659 --> 20:56.499
happen within the first ten minutes
of wounding, right?

20:56.659 --> 20:58.939
Why are you telling me that?
To distract you.

21:00.779 --> 21:03.099
Shit! Keep pressure on it.

21:03.219 --> 21:04.279
Urgh!

21:05.459 --> 21:07.539
Does that feel good? Yeah.

21:09.539 --> 21:12.579
OK, there you go.
Pressure. Pressure there.

21:12.739 --> 21:15.179
We've got to keep moving, Mike.
Yeah, we do.

21:15.339 --> 21:18.179
But you have to do me a favour,
mate. You need to stop bleeding.

21:20.819 --> 21:24.659
What do they say?
Those who live by the sword...

21:24.779 --> 21:26.779
die by the fucking thing.

21:29.099 --> 21:30.979
It's been a long time coming.

21:31.139 --> 21:33.179
You really need to conserve
your energy.

21:33.299 --> 21:34.419
Yeah.

21:34.539 --> 21:35.779
Relax...

21:37.139 --> 21:39.379
You know the first guy
that I killed in battle...

21:40.939 --> 21:42.259
I was shaking.

21:42.379 --> 21:43.779
Trembling.

21:45.059 --> 21:46.659
I even threw up.

21:46.779 --> 21:47.899
Yeah.

21:49.779 --> 21:51.579
When did that stop?

21:55.139 --> 21:57.939
When did this all become normal
for us, Mike?

22:02.139 --> 22:03.619
A long time coming.

22:13.379 --> 22:14.539
Uh-oh..

22:14.659 --> 22:15.979
Maybe not.

22:17.699 --> 22:20.579
Because you're going to make it
through this, OK? Huh?

22:20.739 --> 22:24.419
You're going to survive
and you're going to go home.

22:24.539 --> 22:26.139
Back to the real life?

22:28.139 --> 22:29.899
Paying bills?

22:31.579 --> 22:34.299
And mowing the lawn?

22:34.419 --> 22:36.539
Stopping at a fucking red light?

22:37.979 --> 22:40.179
I can't see that happening.

22:41.259 --> 22:43.099
And being a father to your son.

22:50.699 --> 22:52.699
After the shit I've done?

22:54.259 --> 22:56.099
Sure! Yeah, sure.

23:06.419 --> 23:07.939
Shit.

23:08.059 --> 23:09.339
Stay put.

23:11.739 --> 23:13.299
I won't be long.

23:46.779 --> 23:47.839
Hey!

24:05.139 --> 24:07.259
OK, throw up the knife, couyon.

24:07.379 --> 24:09.699
Couyon, what's that? Is that Cajun?

24:09.819 --> 24:11.659
Cajun for stupid.

24:11.779 --> 24:13.659
Well, I've been called worse.

25:51.099 --> 25:52.539
Come here, mate.

25:57.979 --> 25:59.699
Attaboy. Come on.

26:01.139 --> 26:02.899
Come on. Attaboy.

26:03.059 --> 26:05.699
I'll get you to the rendezvous
and you're going to be fine.

26:05.819 --> 26:07.339
Come on. Wake up here.

26:07.459 --> 26:09.179
Oi! Come on! Scott! Scott!

26:10.779 --> 26:12.339
Come on. Come on.

26:12.499 --> 26:14.939
Come on!
Scott, come on, wake up.

26:15.979 --> 26:17.179
Hey...

26:17.299 --> 26:18.579
Yeah, that's right.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.739
Are you with me...?

27:06.191 --> 27:07.671
Welcome back.

27:11.391 --> 27:12.671
What happened?

27:12.668 --> 27:16.228
I think the words you're looking for
are thank you.

27:16.388 --> 27:17.828
I pulled this out of you.

27:19.708 --> 27:21.988
A bullet with my name on it, huh?

27:25.628 --> 27:27.028
Are we safe here?

27:27.148 --> 27:28.908
Best I could do on short notice.

27:29.068 --> 27:31.148
We'll leave here
under the cover of dark.

27:40.108 --> 27:41.348
Urgh...

27:48.548 --> 27:50.188
Got the passports?

27:50.308 --> 27:51.708
Yeah.

27:51.868 --> 27:54.788
The dumb blonde came all this way
and forgot to bring them!

28:18.108 --> 28:19.588
Thank you.

28:24.108 --> 28:25.548
I don't get.

28:26.948 --> 28:28.668
After all these years...

28:30.428 --> 28:32.948
..and you want back in?

28:33.108 --> 28:35.548
In our line of work,
you make a lot of enemies.

28:35.668 --> 28:38.268
Multiply that by time and...

28:38.388 --> 28:40.508
Well, it's cold out there.

28:43.948 --> 28:47.268
The Agency is the best bet
for survival.

28:47.428 --> 28:51.188
Besides, I was fucking good
at my job.

28:51.308 --> 28:52.588
Yeah.

28:53.708 --> 28:54.868
You were.

28:57.268 --> 28:59.108
Don't you fucking move.

29:03.668 --> 29:06.188
You just still see the bad we did.

29:06.308 --> 29:08.708
I see the good.

29:08.828 --> 29:10.228
No.

29:10.348 --> 29:11.948
I don't.

29:12.108 --> 29:14.908
What I see are bodies
of dead children.

29:15.028 --> 29:16.308
Civilians.

29:19.428 --> 29:20.788
Collateral damage.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.268
Self-justification.

29:25.308 --> 29:26.428
Stay down.

29:35.668 --> 29:37.348
Oh, yeah...!

30:06.268 --> 30:08.828
Go on... Go on, get!

30:27.068 --> 30:30.108
No idea how long those beans
have been there.

30:31.588 --> 30:34.508
Well, it's like me,
it just gets better with age.

30:34.668 --> 30:36.988
I think you'll find that
that's wine and whisky

30:37.108 --> 30:38.828
and English gentlemen, not coffee.

30:45.068 --> 30:46.388
Christy...

30:58.108 --> 31:00.468
Christy, what's out there?

31:03.668 --> 31:05.588
Did they offer you a lot of money?

31:05.748 --> 31:07.788
Are you fucking kidding me?
There's still time.

31:07.948 --> 31:09.668
Shit!

31:09.788 --> 31:11.388
On me! On me!

31:15.748 --> 31:18.228
Are you hit? I'm good.

31:27.028 --> 31:28.228
Hey...

31:29.588 --> 31:31.548
Fuck. She's gone.

31:32.988 --> 31:34.308
Shit.

31:36.468 --> 31:38.868
How are you doing for ammo?
I got one.

31:41.868 --> 31:43.228
Are you ready for this?

31:45.348 --> 31:48.308
I am now, Mike. I am now.

31:55.348 --> 31:58.588
Ain't nothing out the back.
We're going to need more firepower.

31:58.708 --> 32:01.228
We'll just have to improvise, mate.

32:01.348 --> 32:03.548
Shit. I've got movement here.

32:03.668 --> 32:04.708
Same.

32:12.348 --> 32:13.948
Fire teams, ready?

32:15.468 --> 32:17.468
How many you got?

32:19.668 --> 32:22.828
I got two of them in my sight.
Hold! Hold! Hold! Why?

32:22.948 --> 32:24.668
Just trust me. Hold.

32:26.228 --> 32:27.668
Hold. Hold.

32:27.788 --> 32:29.948
Move in. Go! Go! Go!

32:37.348 --> 32:39.748
Was that you? Yeah, what the hell
do you think I was doing?

32:39.868 --> 32:41.308
Fire! Fire! Fire!

33:01.068 --> 33:02.148
Argh!

33:02.268 --> 33:03.308
Fuck!

33:14.348 --> 33:16.468
I'm out! I'm changing!

33:24.268 --> 33:26.308
Flashbang! Move! Move!

33:38.668 --> 33:39.728
Fuck!

33:52.228 --> 33:53.948
Not so fuckin' tough now.

33:55.468 --> 33:56.548
Urgh...!

34:01.668 --> 34:02.708
Urgh!

34:11.108 --> 34:12.228
Argh!

34:18.148 --> 34:20.507
Mike! Scott, are you hit?

34:20.628 --> 34:22.748
Yeah, I got nicked in the leg.

34:24.547 --> 34:26.868
You? Yeah, I'm wonderful. Jesus.

34:27.027 --> 34:29.547
We've got to get out of here, Mike.
There's a van in the garage.

34:29.708 --> 34:32.628
Which way? That way?
It's that way.

34:35.268 --> 34:36.947
Are you ready? Go, Mikey.

34:45.108 --> 34:46.388
Come on, Mikey!

34:47.588 --> 34:48.708
Come on!

34:51.068 --> 34:52.708
I got tagged in the leg.

35:01.668 --> 35:03.068
Can you start it?

35:03.228 --> 35:06.468
You're not the only one
that can improvise, Mikey.

35:06.588 --> 35:08.148
Let's go and find the keys.

35:10.468 --> 35:13.108
We're going to have a problem
starting that. The fuck?!

35:13.228 --> 35:14.628
Shit!

35:14.748 --> 35:16.588
Just one fucking break!

35:29.108 --> 35:30.308
Grab that.

35:36.668 --> 35:37.948
I can't die here.

35:39.188 --> 35:41.068
Not dying in Switzerland.

35:42.308 --> 35:44.908
Yeah, don't worry about it, mate.
You're not going to die here.

35:45.028 --> 35:46.668
That sounds good.

35:46.788 --> 35:49.788
But my lack of ammo, my leg...

35:51.428 --> 35:53.508
..my stomach
tells me something different.

35:56.828 --> 35:58.548
You hear movement?

35:58.668 --> 36:00.308
Fuck. Yeah, yeah.

36:00.428 --> 36:01.708
Hold your fire!

36:01.868 --> 36:04.028
Is that a white flag?
You're kidding me.

36:04.148 --> 36:06.828
Hey, what are you doing?

36:06.988 --> 36:09.708
I'm going to take him out.
No, don't take him out yet.

36:09.828 --> 36:11.428
Why's that? It's a white flag.

36:11.548 --> 36:13.468
It's not a white flag situation.

36:13.588 --> 36:15.268
So what is it?

36:15.428 --> 36:19.228
Some guy, who happens to be waving
something that's white.

36:19.388 --> 36:22.388
We are low on ammo.
And they're not.

36:22.508 --> 36:24.148
Maybe it's a good time to talk?

36:24.268 --> 36:27.188
Guys, do me a favour.

36:27.308 --> 36:29.308
Come out and have a powwow.

36:29.428 --> 36:31.348
I think we're good in here.

36:31.468 --> 36:32.868
We ain't going to shoot at you.

36:33.028 --> 36:35.628
I'm going to go ahead
and call bullshit on that one.

36:35.788 --> 36:38.668
You want to talk?
Get your ass in here.

36:38.788 --> 36:40.428
Hands on head.

36:40.548 --> 36:42.388
Hands on the head.

36:45.828 --> 36:47.228
Oh, shit, man... Hey.

36:49.668 --> 36:51.348
It's all right, I've got him.

36:55.988 --> 36:57.428
Fuck that off...

37:01.468 --> 37:05.108
Just to be clear, I come in peace.

37:05.228 --> 37:06.508
Yeah, right.

37:09.308 --> 37:12.668
It's a hell of a place
to make a last stand.

37:12.828 --> 37:16.588
Me, I always wanted to go out
in Vegas.

37:16.748 --> 37:19.468
Neon lights and rock music,
holding a full house.

37:19.628 --> 37:21.868
You come in here
to share your fantasies?

37:21.988 --> 37:24.068
At least my fantasies are realistic.

37:24.228 --> 37:27.748
This fantasy where you guys
are stuck on a farm,

37:27.868 --> 37:29.428
low on ammo,

37:29.588 --> 37:32.468
bursting out the front,
guns blazing in slow motion,

37:32.588 --> 37:34.508
the great escape.

37:34.628 --> 37:36.988
That ain't happening.

37:37.108 --> 37:38.868
This is where it ends.

37:40.668 --> 37:42.628
Let me get this straight.

37:42.748 --> 37:44.948
You walked all the way over here

37:45.108 --> 37:47.148
just to tell us
that we're going to die?

37:47.268 --> 37:48.788
You don't have to die.

37:51.068 --> 37:52.868
We all know this ain't war.

37:54.308 --> 37:58.188
It's business. I don't care who's
writing the cheques. All I care about

37:58.348 --> 38:01.268
is counting the zeros. Are you
offering us a chance to buy you out?

38:01.388 --> 38:03.468
It really is a piece of shit.

38:03.628 --> 38:05.908
I ain't going to lose any sleep
over it.

38:07.348 --> 38:09.428
Two million, each.

38:09.548 --> 38:13.348
That's pounds, not dollars.

38:13.468 --> 38:15.628
You wire transfer it to my account.

38:15.748 --> 38:17.988
You do that, everybody walks away.

38:18.108 --> 38:19.508
Goodnight. Good luck.

38:20.708 --> 38:22.108
Get fucked.

38:24.948 --> 38:26.828
Was it something I said?

38:26.948 --> 38:28.148
Yeah.

38:29.588 --> 38:31.668
Pretty much everything
you just said.

38:32.828 --> 38:35.148
You really think
we have that kind of money?

38:35.268 --> 38:37.388
You've been doing this a long time.

38:37.548 --> 38:40.268
Surely you've been skimming
something off the top?

38:42.748 --> 38:45.348
We're a couple of soldiers.

38:45.468 --> 38:47.228
Not fucking thieves.

38:48.628 --> 38:50.228
Jesus...!

38:52.228 --> 38:54.868
Ain't my fault
you're the good guys, huh?

38:56.148 --> 38:57.748
Hey, Faber.

38:57.868 --> 38:59.468
Hm?

38:59.588 --> 39:01.508
We were never that good.

39:07.628 --> 39:08.788
Christ!

39:12.268 --> 39:14.068
What happened to the white flag?!

39:14.228 --> 39:17.828
He was just a guy carrying
something that happened to be white!

39:17.948 --> 39:19.028
Grenade!

40:36.668 --> 40:39.148
I told you, Sandra,
I don't want to be disturbed.

40:45.948 --> 40:47.588
Look at them.

40:47.708 --> 40:49.828
Go on, look at them.

40:53.628 --> 40:55.108
These were good men and women

40:55.268 --> 40:57.828
who sacrificed themselves
for this country.

40:57.948 --> 41:00.428
In the name of this government.

41:00.548 --> 41:01.908
Look at them!

41:17.468 --> 41:20.268
The order came from way above me.

41:23.308 --> 41:25.268
You're not going to kill me?

41:29.068 --> 41:31.428
Of course I'm going to kill you.

42:16.108 --> 42:17.868
Well, it's official.

42:20.188 --> 42:21.988
Your dad's dead.

42:23.788 --> 42:26.508
Oi! Do you hear that?

42:26.628 --> 42:28.788
You're dead.

42:28.908 --> 42:29.968
Ha!

42:31.628 --> 42:33.708
Feels pretty good to be dead.

42:33.828 --> 42:35.388
You need a hand?

42:35.508 --> 42:39.188
No. It's a work in progress.

42:39.308 --> 42:41.228
So where are you headed?

42:41.388 --> 42:44.228
Well, I was going to take Finn
on some

42:44.388 --> 42:47.788
historical, cultural,
educational trip.

42:47.908 --> 42:49.628
Hm, which means...?

42:49.748 --> 42:52.028
Vegas, baby! I thought as much.

42:53.548 --> 42:55.388
What about you, Mikey?

42:55.508 --> 42:57.868
Back on civvy street?

42:59.348 --> 43:00.908
What are you going to do?

43:04.828 --> 43:07.268
Shit, Damien, I don't have
a fucking clue.
