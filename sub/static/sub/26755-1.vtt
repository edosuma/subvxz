Savannah.

00:58.653 --> 00:59.619
What's wrong?

00:59.621 --> 01:00.689
There's something in my room.

01:11.100 --> 01:11.932
See?

01:11.934 --> 01:12.767
No monsters.

01:13.936 --> 01:16.436
Do you want me to
check under the bed?

01:16.438 --> 01:17.073
Okay.

01:25.114 --> 01:26.082
No monsters.

01:27.116 --> 01:28.781
Should I check the closet
just so we're safe?

01:28.783 --> 01:30.885
No, don't go in there.

01:30.887 --> 01:32.719
Are you sure?

01:32.721 --> 01:34.621
I can check just so we know.

01:34.623 --> 01:35.688
No Mommy, please.

01:35.690 --> 01:37.490
I'm not scared anymore.

01:37.492 --> 01:38.660
Don't go in there.

01:47.103 --> 01:49.571
I told you you have
nothing to be afraid of.

01:51.640 --> 01:54.409
Darkness is just
darkness, nothing more.

01:59.681 --> 02:00.482
Now into bed.

02:07.689 --> 02:08.925
Can I have my flashlight?

02:13.095 --> 02:14.861
You want me to
sing you a song?

02:17.934 --> 02:19.701

these new guy jitters
and get serious.

06:30.919 --> 06:32.486
- I don't have the jitters.
- Yes you do.

06:32.488 --> 06:33.853
No really I don't.

06:33.855 --> 06:35.855
Your face looks like shit.

06:35.857 --> 06:37.391
You don't even have your badge.

06:37.393 --> 06:39.125
Maybe my face looks
like this naturally

06:39.127 --> 06:41.861
and my badge is
on back order so.

06:41.863 --> 06:43.863
Huh, well maybe it's
your first day on the job,

06:43.865 --> 06:46.966
you're really trying to impress
and you got the jitters.

06:46.968 --> 06:50.970
I got news for you, the
chief don't impress.

06:50.972 --> 06:53.273
Or maybe I'm just curious

06:53.275 --> 06:54.474
about what we're
gonna find out here.

06:54.476 --> 06:55.409
Or maybe...

06:55.411 --> 06:57.145
Maybe you two should shut up.

07:08.923 --> 07:09.958
Where's the rest of it?

07:11.025 --> 07:12.060
Good question.

07:13.295 --> 07:15.897
Ms. Palmer said her dog
drug it up this morning.

07:16.898 --> 07:18.967
Think it could be
the Linemen brothers?

07:20.868 --> 07:21.503
Maybe.

07:22.638 --> 07:25.740
You think the Linemen brothers
would go this far Chief?

07:27.309 --> 07:28.142
Probably not.

07:30.912 --> 07:33.513
I have the feeling it's gonna
be a pretty long weekend boys.

07:33.515 --> 07:37.116
Just a reminder sir, it's
Leeland's graduation weekend.

07:37.118 --> 07:39.153
- I'm aware.
- Think Savannah will show?

07:40.922 --> 07:43.055
50/50.

07:43.057 --> 07:44.959
You don't think she'll
at least show for Leeland?

07:47.929 --> 07:49.163
Alright let's get the...

07:51.467 --> 07:54.068
- Stache.
- Sorry.

07:56.272 --> 07:57.937
Let's get the Linemen
brothers down to the station.

07:57.939 --> 07:59.373
If they do know something
we're gonna find out.

07:59.375 --> 08:00.208
Yes sir.

08:01.510 --> 08:02.378
Who's Savannah?

08:05.581 --> 08:06.415
My daughter.

08:10.118 --> 08:10.952
Come on rook.

08:38.145 --> 08:41.515

08:41.517 --> 08:44.986

09:39.040 --> 09:40.507

09:45.113 --> 09:46.446
Hey.

09:46.448 --> 09:49.215
Mama's gonna go stay at
Jack's for a little bit.

09:49.217 --> 09:53.185
You're gonna go stay with Jenna,
just for a little bit okay?

10:03.965 --> 10:07.467
♪ You think I'm
lazier than hell ♪

10:07.469 --> 10:11.005

10:13.174 --> 10:16.075
- Good morning Ms. Martin.
- Good morning Bill.

10:16.077 --> 10:18.112
- Have a nice day.
- Yeah you too.

10:22.116 --> 10:23.583
Hello and welcome

10:23.585 --> 10:26.085
to Get High in the
Morning with Chris Isaac.

10:26.087 --> 10:28.154
- And Kelly Rae.
- Thanks for listening folks.

10:28.156 --> 10:29.723
We've got a real
treat for you today

10:29.725 --> 10:32.992
because last night Kelly
and I had the opportunity

10:32.994 --> 10:34.360
to sit down with a young author

10:34.362 --> 10:36.763
that has taken
the world by storm

10:36.765 --> 10:40.534
with her debut best selling
book All Light Will End.

10:40.536 --> 10:43.637
Obviously I'm talking
about Savannah Martin,

10:43.639 --> 10:46.540
in the house, on the
show, here we go.

10:46.542 --> 10:51.511
So sit back, relax and get
ready for some ear porn.

10:51.513 --> 10:53.179
Savannah thanks for
being here today.

10:53.181 --> 10:55.615
Thank you for having me Chris.

10:55.617 --> 10:57.249
I want to start off by saying

10:57.251 --> 10:59.285
I absolutely love this book,

10:59.287 --> 11:01.521
but frankly it scared
the hell out of me.

11:01.523 --> 11:03.189
God, me too.

11:03.191 --> 11:06.158
I didn't sleep for three
days after I read this book.

11:06.160 --> 11:08.194
So maybe tell us
a little bit about

11:08.196 --> 11:09.663
what inspired you
to write the book.

11:09.665 --> 11:12.364
Sure, well as a little girl

11:12.366 --> 11:16.235
I struggled with some
really vivid night terrors

11:16.237 --> 11:20.239
and as I got older it was just
something I wanted to voice.

11:20.241 --> 11:22.408
Maybe to come to terms
with it and move on.

11:22.410 --> 11:24.744
See I thought it
was absolutely genius

11:24.746 --> 11:27.614
that you wrote the book from
the mother's perspective.

11:27.616 --> 11:29.081
Yeah me too, me too.

11:29.083 --> 11:31.753
What made you decide
to write from that...

11:39.661 --> 11:42.163
It's been a while
since we last spoke.

11:43.264 --> 11:44.065
Yeah.

11:45.601 --> 11:46.400
How are things?

11:47.301 --> 11:48.568
Good.

11:48.570 --> 11:49.803
Mostly, yeah.

11:49.805 --> 11:51.172
It's been real good.

11:52.306 --> 11:54.306
Are you still seeing Jack?

11:54.308 --> 11:56.143
Mm-hmm, yeah,
we're still together.

11:58.312 --> 11:59.213
Well that's good.

12:00.248 --> 12:01.382
Is it getting serious?

12:04.452 --> 12:05.721
I don't know.

12:06.555 --> 12:07.388
Maybe.

12:09.591 --> 12:12.159
Well your career seems
to be doing very well.

12:13.227 --> 12:14.428
Yeah I suppose so.

12:16.497 --> 12:18.399
Are you still taking
your medication?

12:19.500 --> 12:21.200
Yes.

12:21.202 --> 12:25.373
- I'm not crazy or anything.
- And how are you sleeping?

12:26.374 --> 12:27.709
Good, most days.

12:29.711 --> 12:31.545
Have you noticed
any recurring thoughts,

12:31.547 --> 12:34.348
images, things you can't
shake out of your head?

12:39.353 --> 12:43.355
I have this
nightmare sometimes,

12:43.357 --> 12:46.828
that I'm trapped.

12:48.229 --> 12:49.196
Trapped where?

12:50.799 --> 12:52.300
A psychiatric ward.

12:57.138 --> 12:59.575
So you've been experiencing
more night terrors.

13:01.242 --> 13:04.278
The medication I prescribed
for you can help over time,

13:05.614 --> 13:08.347
but unfortunately there
are certain side effects

13:08.349 --> 13:10.217
that sometimes make them worse.

13:12.788 --> 13:14.188
What happens to them?

13:16.324 --> 13:18.625
Well, there've been
cases in which the patients

13:18.627 --> 13:21.262
have a difficult
time in deciding

13:22.263 --> 13:25.801
where the dream ends
and reality begins

13:27.168 --> 13:30.402
or they live in what
we call a fugue state

13:30.404 --> 13:32.606
in which they disassociate,

13:32.608 --> 13:34.743
but in your
particular case we...

13:38.312 --> 13:40.381
Did you experience
this dream recently?

13:42.450 --> 13:43.883
No.

13:43.885 --> 13:45.252
Oh, well good.

13:47.455 --> 13:51.423
But it happens, I
mean, happened to me,

13:51.425 --> 13:55.294
not disassociation
but occasionally

13:55.296 --> 13:57.463
the dreams would get blurry.

13:57.465 --> 14:00.332
You know sometimes
it would feel like

14:00.334 --> 14:02.501
I brought the
dream back with me.

14:02.503 --> 14:05.439
You know even now
when I'm with friends

14:06.507 --> 14:09.308
and other people
I can still see it

14:09.310 --> 14:11.645
in a dark corner
staring back at me.

14:11.647 --> 14:13.314
What's staring back at you?

14:17.385 --> 14:20.756
The thing that's waiting
for me when I go to sleep.

14:22.858 --> 14:24.860
And what do you
think that represents?

14:27.261 --> 14:30.329
I don't know, you're
the psych, you tell me.

14:31.265 --> 14:33.367
Well it could mean
a number of things.

14:35.771 --> 14:37.003
Have you any feelings of guilt,

14:37.005 --> 14:38.674
persecution, things like that?

14:42.510 --> 14:43.943
I feel...

14:44.980 --> 14:47.481
I feel guilty that I
can't remember that night.

14:48.684 --> 14:51.619
I try but I can't,
it's just a blur.

14:53.454 --> 14:55.454
You know the thing
that haunts me the most

14:55.456 --> 14:59.258
is why she did it.

14:59.260 --> 15:04.198
You know, what was so bad
about her life that she had...

15:08.369 --> 15:10.438
Your mother's death
was not your fault.

15:12.473 --> 15:13.842
We all have inner demons

15:15.043 --> 15:16.978
and sometimes those
inner demons win.

15:39.935 --> 15:41.737
Your dad asked
me to drop this by.

15:44.405 --> 15:46.005
The doctors did
everything they could.

15:46.007 --> 15:48.877
By the time the paramedics
got there she had...

15:54.750 --> 15:55.949
I think your mother
would want you

15:55.951 --> 16:00.454
to know it's not
your fault okay?

16:02.924 --> 16:03.724
Thank you.

16:06.862 --> 16:07.695
Yeah.

16:11.767 --> 16:14.502
I got a text from
my father today.

16:15.536 --> 16:16.836
Well that's good.

16:16.838 --> 16:19.638
Yeah, yeah, it just said
that my younger brother

16:19.640 --> 16:22.844
is graduating this weekend
and invited me to come.

16:24.012 --> 16:26.645
I think it'd be a
great opportunity.

16:26.647 --> 16:29.115
An opportunity to?

16:29.117 --> 16:30.819
To reconcile with your father.

16:31.920 --> 16:32.753
Yeah.

16:36.590 --> 16:38.958
I don't think he wants
to reconcile with me.

16:38.960 --> 16:40.294
I think he might.

16:41.529 --> 16:45.066
Sometimes it's difficult for
fathers to express themselves.

16:47.768 --> 16:48.700
Yeah maybe.

16:48.702 --> 16:51.572
I just, I don't think so.

16:52.740 --> 16:54.508
But what
makes you say that?

16:56.744 --> 17:00.614
Because he's the only
one that knows the truth.

17:05.618 --> 17:06.420
I see.

17:15.096 --> 17:17.096
We can do this the
easy way or the hard way.

17:17.098 --> 17:18.530
Makes no difference to me.

17:18.531 --> 17:21.567
♪ I'm going in
for my first day ♪

17:21.569 --> 17:23.435
I told you he
didn't kill nobody.

17:23.436 --> 17:25.404
That's
what you said but...

17:25.406 --> 17:29.510
Why the hell would I do a
stupid ass thing like that, huh?

17:30.678 --> 17:32.513
Think Mr. Cop.

17:33.982 --> 17:36.182
I got better things
to do with my time.

17:36.184 --> 17:37.384
Like what?

17:38.186 --> 17:39.087
Like this.

17:41.555 --> 17:42.723
Okay, the hard way it is.

17:44.458 --> 17:47.659
Adam, go get my taser.

17:47.661 --> 17:48.760
A taser?

17:48.762 --> 17:50.729
Hell no, hell no.

17:50.731 --> 17:52.165
No look we said we didn't, we,

17:52.167 --> 17:54.535
I swear we didn't kill
nobody, we swear it.

17:55.769 --> 17:58.439
I'm not sure where that is.

17:59.707 --> 18:00.708
Hey Chief, got a sec?

18:01.877 --> 18:02.710
Yeah.

18:05.046 --> 18:06.547
Ran out of donuts.

18:10.584 --> 18:12.218
Yeah, what is it now?

18:12.220 --> 18:14.421
Just got a call
from Janice Peterson.

18:15.489 --> 18:16.488
Okay.

18:16.490 --> 18:19.593
Apparently she found
a hand on her property.

18:24.132 --> 18:25.331
Okay.

18:25.333 --> 18:27.033
Tell Mrs. Peterson we'll be
out there as soon as we can.

18:27.035 --> 18:28.402
Chief one more thing.

18:29.737 --> 18:31.037
Yeah?

18:31.039 --> 18:31.940
This one was female.

18:35.509 --> 18:36.976
You're telling me we
got a second victim?

18:36.978 --> 18:37.845
Seems that way.

18:41.082 --> 18:42.681
What are the odds those
two dipshits in there

18:42.683 --> 18:44.683
are capable of
something like this?

18:44.685 --> 18:45.719
Not good.

18:53.694 --> 18:55.228
That's because you cheat.

18:55.230 --> 18:57.596
I don't cheat.

18:57.598 --> 18:58.231
Faith.

18:58.233 --> 19:00.599
You totally cheat.

19:00.601 --> 19:02.001
Oh bullshit.

19:02.003 --> 19:03.004
Babe, do I cheat?

19:11.212 --> 19:12.544
Babe.

19:12.546 --> 19:13.578
What?

19:13.580 --> 19:14.515
Do I cheat?

19:16.817 --> 19:18.251
I rest my case.

19:18.253 --> 19:20.719
You know what Paul
if being awesome

19:20.721 --> 19:23.622
at everything is cheating
then yeah I cheat.

19:23.624 --> 19:25.160
And he is so humble too.

19:26.527 --> 19:28.462
So we going this
weekend or not?

19:29.630 --> 19:30.931
Yeah, we're down.

19:31.865 --> 19:33.632
Where are we going?

19:33.634 --> 19:35.634
Your brothers' graduation.

19:35.636 --> 19:37.136
I mean unless you
don't want us to.

19:37.138 --> 19:38.704
We don't have to go.

19:38.706 --> 19:40.806
I just really haven't
thought about it.

19:40.808 --> 19:42.674
I think we should go.

19:42.676 --> 19:46.245
I think it's high time your
family met your boyfriend.

19:46.247 --> 19:48.249
We can stay in your
parent's old cabin.

19:50.185 --> 19:52.820
Listen babe if you're not
comfortable we don't have to go.

19:54.755 --> 19:55.654
It's okay.

19:55.656 --> 19:57.192
Sorry, what's that?

19:58.859 --> 20:00.692
Okay we'll go.

20:00.694 --> 20:02.894
- Yeah alright, good.
- Cheers to that.

20:02.896 --> 20:03.797
Clinkies.

20:07.268 --> 20:09.268
Are there any good
places to shop there?

20:10.704 --> 20:12.038
What?

20:12.040 --> 20:13.905
No.

20:13.907 --> 20:15.741
There's not.

20:15.743 --> 20:17.676
I'm sure it'll still be fun.

20:17.678 --> 20:18.677
Yeah.

20:18.679 --> 20:21.080
Alright come on, let's
go superstar, you're up.

20:21.082 --> 20:22.017
Oh am I?

20:24.585 --> 20:25.220
Okay.

20:26.687 --> 20:27.855
Alright I got one.

20:28.956 --> 20:31.590
I can only live
where there's light,

20:31.592 --> 20:33.727
but I die if the
light shines on me.

20:35.796 --> 20:36.797
What am I?

20:40.000 --> 20:42.734
Jack, put down your phone.

20:42.736 --> 20:44.936
I'm texting for work.

20:44.938 --> 20:46.805
Cheater.

20:46.807 --> 20:48.809
It's fine, fine
I don't need the phone.

20:51.812 --> 20:52.813
A shadow.

20:53.881 --> 20:55.747
You got it.

20:55.749 --> 20:58.884
- My smart man, look at you.
- Yeah.

20:58.886 --> 21:01.087
- You're sexy.
- Give me another one.

21:01.089 --> 21:02.721
Get a room, Jesus Christ.

21:02.723 --> 21:05.358
Speaking of that, Savannah
can we crash here tonight?

21:05.360 --> 21:06.927
I drank way too much to drive.

21:07.828 --> 21:09.295
Savannah?

21:09.297 --> 21:10.165
This is my house.

21:11.732 --> 21:14.367
Also can we maybe not
sleep on the couch this time?

21:14.369 --> 21:16.204
There's not a whole
lot of room for.

21:19.374 --> 21:22.776
Okay cool I'm fine with you
guys staying here or whatever.

21:35.356 --> 21:36.755
Fucking Paul.

21:40.395 --> 21:41.960
You want to?

21:44.865 --> 21:47.835
- Oh my god.
- Yeah, me neither.

21:53.941 --> 21:55.176
You okay about this weekend?

21:57.178 --> 21:59.278
Yeah, I'm fine.

21:59.280 --> 22:01.316
I mean staying at the
cabin and everything.

22:04.017 --> 22:08.021
I mean as long as everybody's
there I think I'll be okay.

22:09.756 --> 22:10.391
Good.

22:12.860 --> 22:13.694
Goodnight.

22:25.406 --> 22:28.176
Darkness is just
darkness, nothing more.

22:46.960 --> 22:47.792
See?

22:47.794 --> 22:48.429
No monsters.

22:49.963 --> 22:51.299
Want me to check under the bed?

22:57.871 --> 22:59.938
Want me to check the
closet just to be safe?

22:59.940 --> 23:02.175
- No, don't go in there.
- Are you sure?

23:02.177 --> 23:04.410
Let me check it, just wait here.

23:04.412 --> 23:06.978
No Mommy,
I'm not scared any more.

23:06.980 --> 23:08.283
Don't go in there.

23:13.854 --> 23:18.259
I told you you
have nothing to be afraid of.

24:14.449 --> 24:16.917
There's someone in my room.

24:18.218 --> 24:21.953
There's someone in my room.

24:21.955 --> 24:23.289
Mommy.

25:44.672 --> 25:45.506
Hello?

26:23.678 --> 26:24.512
Mom?

27:22.737 --> 27:24.202
Shit.

27:24.204 --> 27:25.172
What the fuck?

27:44.625 --> 27:46.057
Damn it!

28:24.832 --> 28:27.198
Well good morning beautiful.

28:27.200 --> 28:27.835
You okay?

28:28.803 --> 28:30.669
Do you know what time it is?

28:30.671 --> 28:32.237
Yeah it's like 10:30.

28:32.239 --> 28:33.539
The rest of us are all packed up

28:33.541 --> 28:35.641
so if you want breakfast
you better get a move on.

28:35.643 --> 28:38.176
Plus I made you some
coffee downstairs.

28:38.178 --> 28:39.612
You're a lifesaver, thank you.

28:39.614 --> 28:40.548
Yeah I know.

28:57.330 --> 28:59.732
Okay so how far away
is this place again?

28:59.734 --> 29:01.067
It's about six hours.

29:02.703 --> 29:04.335
Oh my god, kill me.

29:04.337 --> 29:06.239
Come on babe
it's not that bad.

29:10.778 --> 29:14.447
Savannah please tell me
that this place has wifi.

29:15.482 --> 29:18.151
The cabin does not have wifi.

29:19.152 --> 29:20.387
No cell service either.

29:22.255 --> 29:23.290
Shit.

29:24.291 --> 29:25.125
Uh oh.

29:26.393 --> 29:29.296
Okay so what are we gonna be
doing while we're there then?

29:31.131 --> 29:34.232
I don't know, relax, read.

29:34.234 --> 29:36.467
Some board games
and deck of cards.

29:36.469 --> 29:39.337
We could play strip poker.

29:39.339 --> 29:40.340
What?

29:41.876 --> 29:43.341
Oh come on guys.

29:43.343 --> 29:44.845
Savannah you got my
back on this right?

29:46.546 --> 29:49.349
No, you're on your
own with this one.

29:51.719 --> 29:53.919
Let's get to rambling.

29:53.921 --> 29:57.690
♪ I've been holding
out my hands ♪

29:57.692 --> 30:02.697
♪ Feeling somewhat special

30:06.533 --> 30:11.469
♪ But now as time
goes on dear I think ♪

30:11.471 --> 30:16.476
♪ But I tried at first
not to love you ♪

30:19.714 --> 30:23.550
♪ But I tried at first not to

30:28.421 --> 30:31.222
Alright rookie what's the
protocol in this situation?

30:31.224 --> 30:32.858
First we cordon off the area.

30:32.860 --> 30:34.392
- Then...
- Nope.

30:34.394 --> 30:36.496
Protocol's to do
whatever the chief says.

30:40.701 --> 30:44.404
I feel like that was
a preemptive response.

30:48.475 --> 30:50.809
What do you have
for us Mrs. Peterson?

30:50.811 --> 30:53.748
I got a head Chief,
no body, just a head.

30:55.716 --> 30:57.283
I thought you said a hand?

30:58.351 --> 31:00.719
She talks really
fast for an old lady.

31:00.721 --> 31:02.655
I was on my afternoon
walk with Wookie.

31:02.657 --> 31:03.588
- Wookie?
- Dog, shut up.

31:03.590 --> 31:04.823
He started acting strange

31:04.825 --> 31:06.491
so I followed him
across the creek

31:06.493 --> 31:08.428
and I stumbled over a
severed human head Chief.

31:09.629 --> 31:11.562
I won't lie, I vomited
in my mouth a little.

31:11.564 --> 31:15.299
And my husband used to call
that having breakfast twice.

31:15.301 --> 31:17.635
What time was it
you found the head?

31:17.637 --> 31:18.873
Oh about 2:30.

32:35.682 --> 32:36.549
Hello?

32:46.493 --> 32:47.327
Jack?

32:52.933 --> 32:54.001
Hello?

32:59.439 --> 33:00.040
Faith?

33:01.541 --> 33:02.843
Hey are you in there?

33:35.608 --> 33:37.608
Hey!

33:38.545 --> 33:40.446
Guys this is not fucking funny.

33:41.781 --> 33:42.950
Open the door.

34:32.665 --> 34:35.002
- Where is she now?
- Asleep.

34:36.436 --> 34:37.670
- You sure?
- Yes.

34:39.438 --> 34:42.773
- We found another body today.
- Who was it?

34:42.775 --> 34:43.976
Don't know yet,

34:43.978 --> 34:46.610
it's unrecognizable,
like the others.

34:46.612 --> 34:49.614
Any
leads, suspicions?

34:49.616 --> 34:51.716
No, I don't
know what it is.

34:51.717 --> 34:52.985
Hey do me a favor will you?

34:52.987 --> 34:55.652
Could you just leave the
TV off for a few days?

34:55.655 --> 34:57.189
For what purpose?

34:57.191 --> 34:59.124
You know good and
damn well for what purpose.

34:59.126 --> 35:01.427
I don't like what you're
doing, it's wrong.

35:02.129 --> 35:03.228
She's a little girl.

35:03.230 --> 35:06.633
It's not hurting
her and it's necessary.

35:08.701 --> 35:11.036
Is it Dianna?

36:19.006 --> 36:20.740
Savanna, hey baby we're here.

36:32.186 --> 36:33.619
Excited to be back?

36:44.731 --> 36:45.765
Charger.

36:49.669 --> 36:50.803
- I got it.
- Okay.

36:54.841 --> 36:55.808
Let's go.

37:03.117 --> 37:06.284
Hey baby, you okay?

37:06.286 --> 37:07.720
Yeah, I'm fine.

37:09.622 --> 37:10.556
Memories?

37:11.858 --> 37:12.825
Yeah a few.

37:13.760 --> 37:15.795
Hey, hey hey
hey, listen to me.

37:16.796 --> 37:19.699
We are gonna have a
great weekend, okay?

37:21.000 --> 37:21.834
Believe me?

37:23.736 --> 37:25.105
- Yeah.
- I promise.

37:26.906 --> 37:28.808
- Okay.
- That's my girl.

37:32.745 --> 37:33.679
Hey guys.

37:34.847 --> 37:36.283
Is the front door
supposed to be open?

38:13.719 --> 38:15.253
Holy shit.

38:15.255 --> 38:17.755
Leeland, what the hell?

38:17.757 --> 38:19.157
What do you mean
what the hell?

38:19.159 --> 38:21.794
You're the one trying to
murder people with an umbrella.

38:28.801 --> 38:30.801
Nice to see you too sis.

38:30.803 --> 38:31.869
So what's up with
the lights man?

38:31.871 --> 38:34.839
Oh the generator's a
pull crank, it takes two.

38:34.841 --> 38:37.942
Besides I still got the
basic layout memorized, see?

38:37.944 --> 38:39.078
No bumps on my shins.

38:40.046 --> 38:41.848
- Hey I'm Jack.
- Leeland.

38:43.150 --> 38:46.917
This is Paul and
I think you remember Faith

38:46.919 --> 38:48.420
from last summer
when you came up.

38:48.422 --> 38:50.056
- Yeah didn't we...
- Nope.

38:51.158 --> 38:51.991
Nope.

38:54.261 --> 38:56.428
So Leeland, about
those lights buddy?

38:56.430 --> 38:57.364
I'm with you man.

39:00.200 --> 39:01.667
So how you been?

39:03.303 --> 39:05.172
Good, good mostly.

39:06.939 --> 39:08.107
How's everything down here?

39:09.309 --> 39:10.975
It's good.

39:10.977 --> 39:12.011
Slow, but good.

39:13.846 --> 39:17.047
I think we're getting a Subway.

39:20.220 --> 39:22.920
Wow Lee that's real big.

39:22.922 --> 39:27.492
I know.

39:27.494 --> 39:29.762
So how's everything
else going?

39:30.930 --> 39:31.831
You mean, how's Dad?

39:35.768 --> 39:38.838
He's Dad you know, he
doesn't share much.

39:40.207 --> 39:41.241
Yeah, he never has.

39:42.376 --> 39:44.975
I think he's doing
alright though.

39:44.977 --> 39:47.079
He works a lot, drinks a lot.

39:49.015 --> 39:50.883
- He's alright.
- Yeah.

39:55.988 --> 39:57.023
How are you?

39:58.392 --> 39:59.326
I'm good.

40:02.262 --> 40:03.095
I miss Mom.

40:07.033 --> 40:10.901
You know, I see her face
sometimes in strangers,

40:10.903 --> 40:12.306
when I'm walking by I see her.

40:15.242 --> 40:16.443
That ever happen to you?

40:19.879 --> 40:22.882
You and I see very
different faces when we dream.

40:25.519 --> 40:26.917
- Yeah.
- Oh that's the stuff.

40:26.919 --> 40:28.185
- That's it.
- That's the stuff.

40:28.187 --> 40:29.887
We can make
hot dogs and things,

40:29.889 --> 40:30.921
it's gonna be great.

40:30.923 --> 40:33.123
- That's our cue.
- Yeah let's not disappoint.

40:33.125 --> 40:34.892
Hey babe
come on out here

40:34.894 --> 40:36.430
before this thing goes out!

40:38.465 --> 40:40.931
Guys I am totally serious.

40:40.933 --> 40:43.401
They were in one of those
underwater boat things

40:43.403 --> 40:45.570
and it swam right
up to the window

40:45.572 --> 40:47.272
and made eye contact with him.

40:47.274 --> 40:48.741
That is scary.

40:49.909 --> 40:52.076
It had like webbed
hands and weird eyes.

40:52.078 --> 40:54.379
I thought mermaids wore
seashell bikinis though.

40:56.283 --> 40:59.384
Alright, you guys
all laugh it up now.

40:59.386 --> 41:01.519
They're gonna announce that
mermaids are a real thing

41:01.521 --> 41:02.721
and you're gonna
think about this night

41:02.723 --> 41:07.860
and be like, wow, Faith is
never wrong about anything ever.

41:08.928 --> 41:10.928
My girlfriend, the one
who believes in mermaids.

41:10.930 --> 41:12.330
- Shut up.
- Alright, alright, alright.

41:12.332 --> 41:14.231
Let's get back to
the scary stuff.

41:14.233 --> 41:17.001
Savannah why don't you tell
us one of your stories?

41:17.003 --> 41:18.135
Why me?

41:18.137 --> 41:19.337
Seriously?

41:19.339 --> 41:21.171
Maybe 'cause you
have the best selling

41:21.173 --> 41:23.073
scariest book of all time.

41:23.075 --> 41:25.909
Yeah, with a quote from
Stephen King on the cover

41:25.911 --> 41:29.179
that says, chilled
me to my very core.

41:29.181 --> 41:31.015
I'm sure it did.

41:31.017 --> 41:32.883
Hey congrats on
all that by the way.

41:32.885 --> 41:33.951
Thank you.

41:33.953 --> 41:36.122
I read it, it was great.

41:37.491 --> 41:39.324
You didn't read it.

41:39.326 --> 41:42.159
I read the back
of it.

41:42.161 --> 41:44.329
Alright then Leeland,
you're up brother.

41:44.331 --> 41:47.131
I am not good at
telling stories guys.

41:47.133 --> 41:48.098
Yes you are.

41:48.100 --> 41:50.136
I know you at least have one.

41:52.004 --> 41:52.970
Okay.

41:52.972 --> 41:54.271
Yeah, let's hear it come on.

41:54.273 --> 41:56.510
Okay, okay, alright,
alright, calm it down.

42:01.113 --> 42:05.049
So I remember going fishing
with my dad one morning

42:05.051 --> 42:07.084
and if you know
anything about my dad

42:07.086 --> 42:09.654
well when he goes
fishing he does not stop

42:09.656 --> 42:10.724
until the sun goes down.

42:12.258 --> 42:14.124
I was about seven at the
time so I couldn't hold focus

42:14.126 --> 42:15.627
on much for very
long and I remember

42:15.629 --> 42:19.096
I was just super exhausted
and I just wanted to leave,

42:19.098 --> 42:22.066
but he just kept fishing
and fishing and fishing

42:22.068 --> 42:24.170
and finally I fell
asleep in the boat.

42:25.572 --> 42:27.171
I woke up as we were
docking the boat

42:27.173 --> 42:29.973
and we started
unloading everything

42:29.975 --> 42:32.910
and our dock was super close
to Bill Hurt's cornfield

42:32.912 --> 42:34.178
and I remember it was super tall

42:34.180 --> 42:36.115
and it really freaked me out.

42:37.316 --> 42:39.885
Anyways, we're loading
everything into the truck

42:41.087 --> 42:43.954
and I just get this
overwhelming feeling

42:43.956 --> 42:47.059
like something or
someone is watching me

42:48.160 --> 42:50.062
and at one point I
looked over my shoulder

42:51.565 --> 42:53.297
and I see this thing that
I have never seen before.

42:53.299 --> 42:56.636
I mean it was just this
massive black creature,

42:57.537 --> 43:00.072
just staring at me emotionless.

43:02.442 --> 43:04.141
I remember I tried to
get my dad's attention,

43:04.143 --> 43:06.243
but he has a super low
tolerance for that sort of thing

43:06.245 --> 43:08.380
so while he's
loading up the truck

43:08.382 --> 43:09.714
I'm just staring at this thing

43:09.716 --> 43:11.884
and it is staring
right back at me.

43:13.185 --> 43:15.052
Finally we finish loading
everything into the truck,

43:15.054 --> 43:18.989
we hop in, we start it up,
we're heading down the road

43:18.991 --> 43:23.028
and I realize we have to
go right past this thing.

43:24.398 --> 43:27.030
So as we get closer to it I
remember yelling out to my dad,

43:27.032 --> 43:28.198
"look dad there's a monster!"

43:28.200 --> 43:31.237
And he stops the
truck, he sees it too.

43:32.406 --> 43:34.472
He says, "do you see that?"

43:34.474 --> 43:36.340
I nodded my head yeah.

43:36.342 --> 43:37.575
He starts rolling
down his window

43:37.577 --> 43:38.743
and I am begging him not to.

43:38.745 --> 43:41.446
I am begging him not to do
it, but he does it anyways.

43:41.448 --> 43:43.113
Now that we're
close to this thing,

43:43.115 --> 43:45.315
I mean it had to be seven,
maybe eight feet tall.

43:45.317 --> 43:48.385
I mean it was massive and
it was just staring at me,

43:48.387 --> 43:51.123
like it didn't give a damn
that I knew he was there.

43:53.392 --> 43:55.662
I could feel my heart
in my chest and my dad

43:57.096 --> 43:58.964
he looks over at
me solemn as ever

44:00.634 --> 44:03.169
and he said, "son,
that's a scarecrow."

44:05.639 --> 44:06.671
What?

44:06.673 --> 44:08.540
You've got to be kidding me.

44:08.542 --> 44:10.775
I'm like sweating over here.

44:10.777 --> 44:12.610
That scared the
shit out of me man.

44:12.612 --> 44:14.044
Dude that was awesome.

44:14.046 --> 44:15.312
Hey, I did my best.

44:15.314 --> 44:17.449
Alright, I'm next.

44:17.451 --> 44:20.150
Actually I think
that's it for me.

44:20.152 --> 44:21.084
- What?
- Oh come on.

44:21.086 --> 44:21.952
What are you talking about?

44:21.954 --> 44:23.120
We're just getting
the night started.

44:23.122 --> 44:24.188
I'm gonna tell my story.

44:24.190 --> 44:25.355
You're gonna miss it.

44:25.357 --> 44:27.157
I love your
stories, but there's

44:27.159 --> 44:29.794
a nice hot shower
waiting for me okay?

44:29.796 --> 44:31.295
Okay.

44:31.297 --> 44:32.664
Goodnight.

44:32.666 --> 44:34.164
- Night.
- Bye.

44:34.166 --> 44:37.403
Alright, are you guys
ready to shit your pants?

44:39.038 --> 44:41.539
Hold up, you know what I
actually gotta take a piss.

44:41.541 --> 44:42.607
Seriously?

44:42.609 --> 44:43.775
Yeah.

44:43.777 --> 44:44.975
Is there another bathroom
other than the one upstairs?

44:44.977 --> 44:47.779
Yeah there's one in the master
just don't touch anything.

44:47.781 --> 44:50.548
My dad is super OCD about
people touching his stuff.

44:50.550 --> 44:51.183
Copy that.

44:52.284 --> 44:54.086
Nobody wants to hear my story?

44:56.121 --> 44:57.289
You guys suck.

45:26.151 --> 45:27.852
Hello?

45:32.458 --> 45:33.292
Jack?

46:15.267 --> 46:17.267
Whoa, sorry.

46:17.269 --> 46:18.103
Oh god.

46:19.839 --> 46:20.740
You scared me.

46:24.376 --> 46:26.145
Did you happen to
open this door?

46:27.146 --> 46:29.346
No I just got down here.

46:29.348 --> 46:30.282
That's weird.

46:33.519 --> 46:34.588
Is everything okay?

46:36.322 --> 46:38.756
I was just upstairs
and I stumbled

46:38.758 --> 46:40.326
into your parent's bedroom.

46:41.895 --> 46:43.661
I know I wasn't
supposed to be up there,

46:43.663 --> 46:45.830
but curiosity got
the better of me.

46:45.832 --> 46:47.734
Anyways I was just
about to leave

46:49.268 --> 46:51.368
and something across
the room in the shadows

46:51.370 --> 46:56.375
just caught my attention
and I found something.

47:03.783 --> 47:06.718
So why doesn't
your dad live here?

47:06.720 --> 47:08.418
We own some land
out by the bluffs.

47:08.420 --> 47:10.255
He stays in an
Airstreamer out there.

47:11.357 --> 47:12.424
Yeah, but why?

47:14.193 --> 47:15.594
Too many bad memories I guess.

47:17.496 --> 47:19.331
Can't get him to get
rid of the place either.

47:23.737 --> 47:26.436
You know I haven't told that
scarecrow story in years.

47:26.438 --> 47:28.407
'Cause it makes you
sound like a pussy?

47:30.209 --> 47:31.709
Savannah and I used
to tell that story

47:31.711 --> 47:33.443
all the time to mess
with our friends.

47:33.445 --> 47:35.782
So she's always liked
telling scary stories then?

47:36.650 --> 47:37.849
The funny thing actually,

47:37.851 --> 47:39.583
she hated them when
she was little.

47:39.585 --> 47:40.785
I was never able to tell the end

47:40.787 --> 47:43.220
of that scarecrow story
when she was around.

47:43.222 --> 47:43.955
What do you mean?

47:43.957 --> 47:45.357
'Cause of her night terrors.

47:48.728 --> 47:50.427
And there was something else

47:50.429 --> 47:52.364
in that cornfield that night
other than the scarecrow.

47:54.366 --> 47:55.401
What was it?

47:57.536 --> 47:58.805
I don't know.

48:00.472 --> 48:01.505
That's where they found
all those dead bodies

48:01.507 --> 48:04.376
of those people that
were killed 20 years ago.

48:33.807 --> 48:35.340
What the hell?

48:36.910 --> 48:37.744
Oh shit.

48:59.398 --> 49:00.464
Hey.

49:00.466 --> 49:01.968
Have you seen Paul?

49:02.902 --> 49:04.468
No.

49:04.470 --> 49:06.238
Oh, he probably went running.

49:11.643 --> 49:12.478
You okay?

49:13.579 --> 49:14.413
Yeah.

49:15.547 --> 49:16.482
I'm just tired.

49:20.519 --> 49:23.520
You know it's kind
of beautiful out here,

49:23.522 --> 49:24.423
but like really quiet.

49:26.025 --> 49:27.491
Yeah.

49:27.493 --> 49:28.926
Sometimes you just
forget over time,

49:28.928 --> 49:33.933
but man I've really really
enjoyed it as a child mostly.

49:37.036 --> 49:38.970
I mean I could probably never

49:38.972 --> 49:40.737
live this far away from a mall,

49:40.739 --> 49:45.744
but I can see myself
bringing the kids out here

49:46.411 --> 49:47.746
for like a vacation
or something.

49:49.481 --> 49:51.583
You want kids, with Paul?

49:54.486 --> 49:57.556
I mean, what, you've never
thought about kids with Jack?

49:59.458 --> 50:02.026
I mean that's just so far out,

50:02.028 --> 50:04.429
you know I haven't
even thought about it.

50:08.500 --> 50:12.337
I mean I know he's
like a total dork.

50:16.910 --> 50:18.077
But he's fun you know?

50:20.479 --> 50:22.481
Yeah he's really nice.

50:24.449 --> 50:25.084
Yeah.

50:29.588 --> 50:30.890
Can I ask you something?

50:32.491 --> 50:33.960
Of course you can.

50:36.029 --> 50:39.931
If you had a secret
that would, you know,

50:39.933 --> 50:42.568
pretty much make everybody
think your were crazy,

50:43.870 --> 50:47.504
but not telling is
like a slow descent

50:47.506 --> 50:50.409
into insanity itself
would you tell?

50:57.649 --> 50:59.884
Are we talking about
somebody in particular here?

50:59.886 --> 51:02.922
No, no, no, no it's
just hypothetical.

51:05.657 --> 51:08.527
Okay, that's a
really weird question.

51:12.932 --> 51:13.765
I would tell.

51:15.434 --> 51:17.168
Yeah, you would?

51:17.170 --> 51:21.673
Fuck it, I mean who cares
what they think right?

51:22.909 --> 51:25.475
You know you're a
really good friend.

51:25.477 --> 51:26.545
Yeah I know.

51:30.149 --> 51:32.917
- Can we go to bed now?
- Yeah.

51:32.919 --> 51:34.620
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

53:06.812 --> 53:11.817
I found something.

53:15.921 --> 53:20.924
I found something
that I don't think

53:20.926 --> 53:22.794
I was supposed to find.

53:24.796 --> 53:25.831
Paul?

54:01.067 --> 54:03.833
Hey, Paul didn't
come to bed last night

54:03.835 --> 54:05.704
and I still can't find him.

54:31.330 --> 54:33.765
Damn it Paul where are you?

54:44.277 --> 54:46.645
Guys, over here!

54:54.187 --> 54:58.122
I found his phone which means
he can't be far away right?

54:58.124 --> 55:00.990
Okay, so let's split
up and search for him.

55:00.992 --> 55:03.760
Hey, hey, he's probably
just messing with us alright?

55:03.762 --> 55:04.928
Don't worry.

55:04.930 --> 55:08.199
- Listen, be careful okay?
- Yeah, you too.

55:23.982 --> 55:25.284
Do you recognize her?

55:26.852 --> 55:28.319
No.

55:28.321 --> 55:30.920
I guess Wookie must've
drug it hear from somewhere.

55:30.922 --> 55:32.624
About fainted when
I first saw it.

55:33.825 --> 55:36.260
Then I figured it must
be another Linemen prank.

55:36.262 --> 55:38.828
Those assholes are always
trying to screw with people.

55:38.830 --> 55:41.931
The last Halloween they put up
missing signs all over town.

55:41.933 --> 55:43.400
Folks that weren't even missing.

55:43.402 --> 55:44.403
Remember that Chief?

55:45.371 --> 55:46.769
Had people thinking there was

55:46.771 --> 55:49.841
a serial killer in town
or something worse.

55:51.042 --> 55:52.677
Worse than a serial killer?

55:53.379 --> 55:55.279
You have no idea.

55:55.281 --> 55:56.982
You gotta talk to them boys.

55:58.251 --> 56:00.919
I don't think this is the
Linemen boys Mrs. Peterson.

56:03.156 --> 56:04.423
You okay Mrs. Peterson?

56:05.291 --> 56:07.191
I need to sit down.

56:07.193 --> 56:08.925
Adam could you get
some water in the car

56:08.927 --> 56:10.361
and tend to Mrs.
Peterson please?

56:10.363 --> 56:11.197
Yes sir.

56:23.309 --> 56:25.178
What do you make
of all this Chief?

56:28.013 --> 56:29.846
What kind of dog
is Wookie again?

56:29.848 --> 56:30.849
He's a Yorkie.

56:32.951 --> 56:34.784
A human head weighs?

56:34.786 --> 56:36.953
10, 11 pounds tops, why?

56:36.955 --> 56:38.291
What does a Yorkie weigh?

56:41.927 --> 56:44.029
The rest of the
body has to be close.

56:50.203 --> 56:51.801
Paul!

56:51.803 --> 56:53.038
You idiot where are you?

56:56.041 --> 56:58.875
It's just
a storm sweetheart.

56:58.877 --> 57:00.843

Do you always have to
get an attitude with me

57:58.103 --> 57:59.538
every time I come
to talk to you?

58:01.374 --> 58:04.608
I wouldn't if you
actually talked to me,

58:04.610 --> 58:08.113
but you don't, you talk at me.

58:10.148 --> 58:12.485
I just came to see how
your writing is going.

58:13.852 --> 58:15.854
Since when do you
care about my writing?

58:16.988 --> 58:18.021
Since it could
potentially reflect

58:18.023 --> 58:20.025
poorly on me if
it's not any good.

58:21.226 --> 58:23.460
Wow, thanks for the
vote of confidence Mother.

58:23.462 --> 58:26.297
I'm just saying
I've worked very hard

58:26.299 --> 58:29.433
to build my reputation and I
don't want it watered down.

58:29.435 --> 58:33.570
What do you expect me
to do, change my name?

58:33.572 --> 58:35.940
Actually a pseudonym
had crossed my mind.

58:36.975 --> 58:38.041
You're unbelievable.

58:38.043 --> 58:40.845
I just think it's
something worth considering.

58:42.315 --> 58:44.147
I also think you should consider

58:44.149 --> 58:46.115
coordinating your
writing schedule.

58:46.117 --> 58:47.486
What's that supposed to mean?

58:48.887 --> 58:51.120
I read some of your
draft last night and...

58:51.122 --> 58:53.156
Why are you going
through my stuff?

58:53.158 --> 58:56.059
- Don't make this a thing.
- No that is a thing.

58:56.061 --> 58:57.328
It's obviously a thing.

58:57.330 --> 59:00.298
- Honey you always do this.
- Do what Mother?

59:01.933 --> 59:04.133
I can't constantly live up to
your god damn expectations.

59:04.135 --> 59:05.604
Don't speak to me that way.

59:09.007 --> 59:13.211
Writing a book takes
sacrifice, commitment,

59:14.347 --> 59:16.582
things that I'm not
sure you're capable of.

59:19.050 --> 59:20.151
Enlighten me Mother.

59:23.054 --> 59:24.923
What exactly are you capable of?

59:31.029 --> 59:32.130
It's all right here.

59:35.133 --> 59:36.533
Your father's dropping
the manuscript

59:36.535 --> 59:38.404
by my publisher
tomorrow afternoon.

59:42.508 --> 59:44.708
This is what it takes
to be a real writer.

59:48.213 --> 59:50.547
Paul!

59:50.549 --> 59:52.181
Where are you?

59:56.655 --> 59:58.655
It's not fucking funny!

59:58.657 --> 01:00:00.289
Mom?

01:00:02.428 --> 01:00:03.328
You're unbelievable.

01:00:04.963 --> 01:00:08.231
Hush now, this
book changes everything.

01:00:27.051 --> 01:00:27.751
Faith.

01:00:36.595 --> 01:00:37.430
Faith.

01:00:40.331 --> 01:00:42.233
What the fuck happened?

01:00:45.403 --> 01:00:48.137
It's all your fault.

01:00:49.575 --> 01:00:52.177
- What?
- It's all your fault.

01:00:57.650 --> 01:00:59.184
It's all your fault.

01:01:00.619 --> 01:01:01.752
Faith what are you doing?

01:01:01.754 --> 01:01:04.255
It's all your fucking fault!

01:01:07.125 --> 01:01:09.225
Who else knows?

01:01:09.227 --> 01:01:10.494
No one.

01:01:10.496 --> 01:01:13.229
And I'm willing to
keep it that way.

01:01:13.231 --> 01:01:17.433
- What do you want Paul?
- What do I want?

01:01:17.435 --> 01:01:22.440
I want to know exactly what
my silence is worth to you.

01:01:24.743 --> 01:01:26.512
What did he find Savannah?

01:01:28.714 --> 01:01:33.282
I found something.

01:01:33.284 --> 01:01:38.289
I found something that I don't
think I was supposed to find.

01:01:44.295 --> 01:01:45.230
What do you mean?

01:01:47.232 --> 01:01:49.167
Let me be a little
bit more specific.

01:01:50.468 --> 01:01:53.202
I found something
that I don't think you

01:01:53.204 --> 01:01:57.075
specifically would
want anyone to find.

01:02:00.613 --> 01:02:02.646
I don't know what
you're talking about Paul.

01:02:02.648 --> 01:02:05.147
No I think you know exactly

01:02:05.149 --> 01:02:07.352
what I'm talking about Savannah.

01:02:08.687 --> 01:02:12.756
I'm talking about that
dark intimate little secret

01:02:12.758 --> 01:02:15.326
that's been eating away at
the inside of your soul.

01:02:17.262 --> 01:02:18.329
Who else knows?

01:02:19.264 --> 01:02:20.365
No one.

01:02:21.366 --> 01:02:23.268
And I'm willing to
keep it that way.

01:02:25.203 --> 01:02:26.404
What do you want Paul?

01:02:28.641 --> 01:02:29.708
What do I want?

01:02:33.546 --> 01:02:38.349
I want to know exactly what
my silence is worth to you.

01:02:43.288 --> 01:02:44.723
What did he find?

01:02:47.191 --> 01:02:48.794
What secret is so
important that you

01:02:50.361 --> 01:02:53.296
had to murder my boyfriend
to keep him silent?

01:02:53.298 --> 01:02:54.365
I didn't murder him.

01:02:56.234 --> 01:02:59.268
Are you gonna tell me you
didn't sleep with him too?

01:02:59.270 --> 01:03:00.737
I have the recording!

01:03:00.739 --> 01:03:03.640
Whoa, whoa, whoa what
the hell is going on Faith?

01:03:03.642 --> 01:03:05.243
Faith put the ax down.

01:03:07.211 --> 01:03:09.278
Oh what the fuck.

01:03:13.752 --> 01:03:15.384
This is all your fault.

01:03:15.386 --> 01:03:16.485
Faith, Faith put the ax down.

01:03:16.487 --> 01:03:18.655
- Get away from me!
- Faith just put the ax down!

01:03:18.657 --> 01:03:20.824
Paul, of course
you'd get lost.

01:03:20.826 --> 01:03:22.191
Fuck.

01:03:43.181 --> 01:03:43.816
Savannah?

01:04:06.739 --> 01:04:09.273
It was an accident,
I didn't mean to.

01:04:23.922 --> 01:04:25.454
It's my mom.

01:04:30.929 --> 01:04:31.897
Savannah.

01:04:36.467 --> 01:04:38.367
It's all my fault.

01:04:38.369 --> 01:04:41.205
This is what it
takes to be a real writer.

01:05:12.905 --> 01:05:14.439
You've got to be kidding.

01:05:16.307 --> 01:05:16.942
I'm sorry?

01:05:19.343 --> 01:05:21.646
You've really outdone
yourself this time mother.

01:05:23.648 --> 01:05:25.550
What are you talking
about Savannah?

01:05:26.985 --> 01:05:29.687
You're gonna just sit there
and act like you're innocent

01:05:30.856 --> 01:05:32.223
after everything
that you've done.

01:05:36.294 --> 01:05:37.930
Everything I did,
I did it for you.

01:05:39.497 --> 01:05:40.565
Bullshit.

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:43.401
You did it for yourself.

01:05:44.737 --> 01:05:46.704
I did it because
it had to be done.

01:05:47.806 --> 01:05:49.674
Who do you think
pays for all of this?

01:05:50.876 --> 01:05:52.677
Not your father's
joke of a salary.

01:05:54.579 --> 01:05:57.883
My writing has paved the way
for you and for your brother.

01:05:59.417 --> 01:06:00.683
Do you think those
publishers would be

01:06:00.685 --> 01:06:02.955
considering your book if
you weren't my daughter?

01:06:04.689 --> 01:06:07.824
What would they say if
I told them the truth?

01:06:07.826 --> 01:06:09.260
Don't you understand?

01:06:10.062 --> 01:06:12.728
This book changes everything,

01:06:12.730 --> 01:06:15.531
for me, for you, for all of us.

01:06:15.533 --> 01:06:17.834
At what cost?

01:06:17.836 --> 01:06:18.734
You're missing the point.

01:06:18.736 --> 01:06:20.469
No.

01:06:20.471 --> 01:06:22.373
That's the fucking point.

01:06:25.543 --> 01:06:26.845
No one will believe you,

01:06:28.513 --> 01:06:30.581
it's in your best interest
to keep this to yourself.

01:06:32.383 --> 01:06:33.518
And what if I don't?

01:06:35.553 --> 01:06:38.554
Is that a chance
you're willing to take?

01:06:38.556 --> 01:06:39.490
Go fuck yourself.

01:06:49.567 --> 01:06:50.867
Your mother's
death was not your fault.

01:06:50.869 --> 01:06:52.370
It's all my fault.

01:06:54.039 --> 01:06:55.540
We all have inner demons

01:06:56.741 --> 01:06:58.776
and sometimes those
inner demons win.

01:07:01.079 --> 01:07:02.645
There've been cases
in which the patients

01:07:02.647 --> 01:07:05.015
have a difficult
time in deciding

01:07:05.017 --> 01:07:09.451
where the dream ends
and reality begins.

01:07:09.453 --> 01:07:12.421
Or they live in what
we call a fugue state

01:07:12.423 --> 01:07:13.859
in which they disassociate.

01:07:15.027 --> 01:07:18.429
That happens, I
mean happened to me.

01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:21.432
You know, sometimes I feel like

01:07:22.533 --> 01:07:23.836
I brought the
dream back with me.

01:07:26.839 --> 01:07:27.672
You're right.

01:07:29.574 --> 01:07:30.608
What?

01:07:33.045 --> 01:07:33.879
It's my fault.

01:07:37.182 --> 01:07:42.386
Do you want to know
Savannah's dark little secret?

01:07:42.955 --> 01:07:44.888
Is that what you want?

01:07:44.890 --> 01:07:46.022
It was an accident Savannah.

01:07:46.024 --> 01:07:48.961
There are no accidents Faith.

01:07:53.564 --> 01:07:56.001
Do you want to know me Faith?

01:08:03.708 --> 01:08:06.811
I mean do you really
want to know me?

01:08:16.487 --> 01:08:19.622
Savannah, what are you doing?

01:08:19.624 --> 01:08:21.026
Goodbye Mother.

01:08:23.728 --> 01:08:25.130
I murdered my mother.

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:33.636
That's it.

01:08:33.638 --> 01:08:35.908
And it seems I started
feeling guilt about it.

01:08:37.042 --> 01:08:41.078
She fucking tormented
me my entire life.

01:08:42.479 --> 01:08:46.615
She used me like a god
damn science experiment.

01:08:59.965 --> 01:09:04.832
Mommy's
here.

01:09:04.835 --> 01:09:06.734
And it's necessary.

01:09:06.737 --> 01:09:07.670
Tormenting
our daughter

01:09:07.671 --> 01:09:09.104
for the sake of a damn book?

01:09:09.107 --> 01:09:10.572
This has to stop Dianna.

01:09:10.573 --> 01:09:11.439
This has to stop now.

01:09:11.442 --> 01:09:13.778
One day
she'll understand.

01:09:15.513 --> 01:09:17.813
This is what it takes
to be a real writer.

01:09:17.814 --> 01:09:20.816
You can't just sit there
and act like you're innocent

01:09:20.818 --> 01:09:23.252
after everything
that you've done.

01:09:23.255 --> 01:09:24.720
No one will believe you.

01:09:24.721 --> 01:09:26.089
I think
your mother would

01:09:26.091 --> 01:09:28.093
want you to to know
it's not your fault.

01:09:40.871 --> 01:09:42.573
So I stole the book.

01:09:44.841 --> 01:09:47.876
Took all the words,
the glory, the money.

01:09:47.877 --> 01:09:50.212
See I thought
it was absolutely genius

01:09:50.215 --> 01:09:53.816
that you wrote the book from
the mother's perspective.

01:09:53.818 --> 01:09:54.985
Well...

01:09:54.987 --> 01:09:57.020
And actually
speaking of mothers

01:09:57.022 --> 01:10:00.156
how helpful was it having
such a successful author

01:10:00.158 --> 01:10:03.692
such as the late Dianna Martin
as your real life mother?

01:10:03.694 --> 01:10:05.761
- I can only imagine.
- God yeah.

01:10:05.763 --> 01:10:08.133
Was she instrumental in
helping you finish the book?

01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:10.835
Definitely.

01:10:12.636 --> 01:10:16.640
And I deserve every good
thing that came from it

01:10:17.742 --> 01:10:19.111
and as for your dead boyfriend.

01:10:25.816 --> 01:10:27.651
He wanted me.

01:10:28.753 --> 01:10:29.887
I knew you'd come around.

01:10:31.689 --> 01:10:32.621
He wanted me so much

01:10:32.623 --> 01:10:36.092
he blackmailed me
over the truth Faith.

01:10:36.094 --> 01:10:38.829
- Savannah please...
- Shut up!

01:10:41.832 --> 01:10:42.800
Don't worry.

01:10:43.868 --> 01:10:44.802
I didn't fuck him.

01:10:53.178 --> 01:10:55.744
But I did kill him.

01:11:02.887 --> 01:11:03.522
Faith.

01:11:07.159 --> 01:11:09.125
Say hello to my mother for me.

01:11:09.127 --> 01:11:12.395
Savannah stop!

01:11:20.704 --> 01:11:21.872
What the fuck?

01:11:41.859 --> 01:11:44.793
You ever seen anything
like this before Chief?

01:11:44.795 --> 01:11:45.830
About 20 years ago.

01:11:47.064 --> 01:11:51.669
Do you think this is a kill
out of necessity or passion?

01:11:53.405 --> 01:11:55.906
I've seen both, but
this is pure evil.

01:12:03.448 --> 01:12:05.850
Apparently I left the
walkie in the truck.

01:12:11.256 --> 01:12:12.888
Margaret?

01:12:12.890 --> 01:12:14.124
I've been trying

01:12:14.126 --> 01:12:15.824
to get a hold of you
for over an hour.

01:12:15.826 --> 01:12:18.228
We got a distress call from a
landline out your way, over.

01:12:18.230 --> 01:12:19.795
Where, over.

01:12:33.278 --> 01:12:34.379
What's protocol now?

01:12:35.213 --> 01:12:36.912
Shit.

01:12:55.065 --> 01:12:56.765
Fuck, fuck.

01:13:18.055 --> 01:13:20.258
Keys, keys.

01:13:25.863 --> 01:13:27.863
Yeah, yeah hello?

01:13:27.865 --> 01:13:29.365
Look there's been a murder.

01:13:29.367 --> 01:13:32.034
I'm at 114 Lavender
Lane and it's...

01:13:33.003 --> 01:13:33.837
Hello?

01:13:36.006 --> 01:13:37.275
- Hello Jack.
- Fuck.

01:13:40.512 --> 01:13:42.312
What's wrong?

01:13:42.314 --> 01:13:43.246
What's wrong?

01:13:43.248 --> 01:13:44.813
Oh I don't know you just killed

01:13:44.815 --> 01:13:46.817
all our friends you crazy bitch.

01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:49.319
A little.

01:13:49.321 --> 01:13:51.356
Just stay away from me okay?

01:13:52.524 --> 01:13:54.058
I thought you loved me Jack?

01:13:55.159 --> 01:13:56.860
Why are you doing this?

01:13:57.562 --> 01:14:00.062
I'm working on new book.

01:14:00.064 --> 01:14:00.965
Shit.

01:14:13.411 --> 01:14:15.077
Chief,
we're in the squad car,

01:14:15.079 --> 01:14:16.381
we got your six, over.

01:14:17.482 --> 01:14:19.948
I'm at the cabin, over

01:14:19.950 --> 01:14:23.151
Copy that,
closing in, over.

01:14:42.574 --> 01:14:44.239
Jesus Christ.

01:15:20.978 --> 01:15:22.046
Natchez police.

01:15:37.395 --> 01:15:42.400
- Any new leads, suspicions?
- No, I don't know what it is.

01:15:45.135 --> 01:15:49.273
You okay Chief,
we're getting close over.

01:15:53.210 --> 01:15:56.111
We're clear here, over.

01:15:56.113 --> 01:15:59.116
- What, Chief you said that...
- We're clear here, over.

01:16:02.387 --> 01:16:04.154
Copy that.
