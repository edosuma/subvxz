WEBVTT

00:31.832 --> 00:33.498
Don't touch me.
No, I am going in there.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.200
Get the fuck out of the
way. I'm going in there.

00:35.202 --> 00:37.836
Dad, do you understand
that she is pregnant?

00:37.838 --> 00:39.504
You can't just leave
her locked in the room.

00:39.506 --> 00:41.640
I don't give a fuck
what you think.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.341
Open the fucking door.

00:43.343 --> 00:44.843
God, you are such a fucking,

00:44.845 --> 00:47.546
you are a fucking asshole, move!

00:56.423 --> 00:58.590
Ariane, fuck.

01:00.360 --> 01:01.526
What did you do?

01:01.528 --> 01:02.527
Ariane, what the
fuck have you done?

01:02.529 --> 01:04.596
How many pills have you taken?

01:04.598 --> 01:06.865
Talk to me, Ariane.

01:06.867 --> 01:07.799
Oh shit.

01:09.102 --> 01:10.735
Okay, your water broke.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.370
We need to go to
the hospital now.

01:12.372 --> 01:13.271
We need to go now.

01:13.273 --> 01:15.340
Oh God, fuck, this kid's coming.

01:15.342 --> 01:16.541
The kid is coming now.

01:16.543 --> 01:18.376
Fuck, okay, I've
got to drive you.

01:18.378 --> 01:21.079
I'm gonna fucking drive you
to the hospital, let's go.

02:39.760 --> 02:40.659
Fuck.

03:31.712 --> 03:32.744
Hi.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.312
I would like to put in a request

03:34.314 --> 03:36.381
to get in touch with
an adoptive family.

03:37.250 --> 03:38.583
I am a birth mother.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.253
The waiver, yeah, I signed
it a couple years ago.

03:43.190 --> 03:44.456
Yeah, I'll hold.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.193
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:48.195 --> 03:49.694
I'll take that.

03:49.696 --> 03:50.929
Thank you.

03:50.931 --> 03:52.263
I missed you.

03:54.267 --> 03:55.734
You look great.

03:58.338 --> 03:59.871
You got anything to drink?

03:59.873 --> 04:00.739
Yeah.

04:11.418 --> 04:12.283
So.

04:14.187 --> 04:15.587
How has your brother been?

04:15.589 --> 04:17.122
I haven't seen him in a while.

04:19.059 --> 04:20.959
Can we not talk about him?

04:38.378 --> 04:40.111
Slow down, slow down.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.412
Hey, calm down.

04:41.414 --> 04:43.448
Look at me, look at me.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.307
I realize I've never
told you your story.

05:11.011 --> 05:13.311
I'll never forget the
day I surrendered you.

05:14.581 --> 05:18.550
Life was very
complicated back then.

05:22.455 --> 05:24.022
You don't always
have to leave.

05:26.092 --> 05:26.991
I know.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.368
I was so scared.

05:39.873 --> 05:43.274
And this lawyer came to me,

05:43.276 --> 05:47.745
and she told me that
you could be okay.

05:49.983 --> 05:52.183
That you could have
a really good life.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.722
That's all I cared about.

06:03.396 --> 06:04.295
I was 17.

06:07.200 --> 06:12.270
And for a few brief
moments, you were mine.

06:56.549 --> 06:58.850
Thank you for taking
the time to see me.

06:58.852 --> 06:59.918
Of course.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.954
It's about my son Logan.

07:05.025 --> 07:07.959
For the past month,
it's been really hard

07:07.961 --> 07:10.762
to get a read on what's
going on with him.

07:10.764 --> 07:15.833
He's skipping
school, smoking pot.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.103
Started calling me Kristen.

07:20.540 --> 07:22.573
I just, I don't see him.

07:22.575 --> 07:25.643
And when I do,

07:27.113 --> 07:28.846
he won't talk.

07:30.583 --> 07:31.649
How old is Logan?

07:32.652 --> 07:35.386
He just turned
17, on the 15th.

07:36.756 --> 07:37.722
And with my work schedule,

07:37.724 --> 07:38.923
it's just been really hard

07:38.925 --> 07:42.493
to find the time to
deal with all of this.

07:43.596 --> 07:45.129
What about something
that may have triggered

07:45.131 --> 07:47.899
this new behavior?

07:47.901 --> 07:49.634
Any kind of trauma?

07:49.636 --> 07:50.835
No, not exactly.

07:54.074 --> 07:54.973
Except...

07:58.945 --> 07:59.844
It's okay.

08:01.247 --> 08:02.046
Take your time.

08:04.985 --> 08:08.486
I was never able to conceive,

08:10.623 --> 08:15.093
so we adopted Logan.

08:17.931 --> 08:21.499
We brought him home from
Legacy Emmanuel Hospital.

08:28.875 --> 08:29.774
Okay.

08:32.879 --> 08:35.646
- And so you've told him.
- Yeah.

08:35.648 --> 08:36.547
Just last month.

08:40.687 --> 08:45.757
And has he had
any contact with

08:47.193 --> 08:49.227
his birth mother at this point?

08:49.229 --> 08:52.063
No, I don't
think he's ready for that.

08:56.469 --> 08:57.535
If I can ask,

09:00.140 --> 09:04.409
what made you wait
until now to tell him?

09:06.579 --> 09:08.112
I felt guilty.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.816
He deserves to know the truth.

09:13.186 --> 09:14.652
Well, first of all,

09:16.156 --> 09:18.689
I think it's
important to point out

09:18.691 --> 09:22.093
what a brave thing you've
done by telling him.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.430
I'm sure that was
very scary for you.

09:28.201 --> 09:33.104
Also, parenting is,
it's impossible.

09:36.443 --> 09:38.042
And stressful.

09:38.044 --> 09:40.445
And you've taken a huge
step in helping your son

09:40.447 --> 09:41.712
by even coming here today.

09:41.714 --> 09:44.782
So I just really want
to acknowledge that.

09:45.718 --> 09:46.851
Thank you.

09:49.055 --> 09:53.024
And you know, if you'd like,

09:53.026 --> 09:56.427
I'd be happy to
see him one on one.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.697
You know, it's possible
that he'll open up

09:59.699 --> 10:02.633
if he feels like he's being
given the space to do so.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.303
That would be great.

10:07.807 --> 10:08.706
Okay.

10:09.809 --> 10:10.708
Sure.

10:24.924 --> 10:27.825
So what did your sister say?

10:27.827 --> 10:31.996
Thing is, it's his
birthday this week.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.733
Which usually distracts her.

10:37.770 --> 10:39.570
So we'll see.

10:39.572 --> 10:40.805
Look, I get it.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.507
I can't imagine
what that's like.

10:43.776 --> 10:46.077
But this isn't healthy,
she needs to move on.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.311
Yeah, no shit.

10:48.915 --> 10:49.981
Try telling her that.

10:51.518 --> 10:52.383
Hey look.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.153
Whatever happens,
we'll make it work.

10:56.589 --> 10:58.923
I'm here, I'm not
going anywhere.

11:00.527 --> 11:03.027
She needs to respect
everything you've done for her.

11:04.364 --> 11:07.265
She wouldn't be who she
is if it weren't for you.

11:21.548 --> 11:22.780
Ariane, got a minute?

11:24.184 --> 11:26.284
Yeah, is everything alright?

11:26.286 --> 11:28.619
Oh yeah, yeah, how'd it go?

11:31.124 --> 11:32.456
Oh it was fine.

11:32.458 --> 11:33.791
So listen, a bunch of
us are gonna go to dinner.

11:33.793 --> 11:35.026
I don't know if
you have any plans,

11:35.028 --> 11:37.228
but you're certainly
welcome to join us.

11:37.230 --> 11:38.396
Oh, thank you.

11:39.832 --> 11:42.833
But, I'm kind of
exhausted, actually.

11:42.835 --> 11:44.969
I think I'm just gonna go
home.

11:44.971 --> 11:47.705
Yeah I had to add something...

11:47.707 --> 11:49.640
Fuck, hold on one second.

11:51.578 --> 11:52.777
What the fuck?

12:06.259 --> 12:07.158
Hey.

12:08.194 --> 12:09.160
What are you doing here?

12:09.162 --> 12:10.061
Hi.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.930
Just stopped by after work.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.099
Can I...

12:16.736 --> 12:19.070
Can I hang out here for a bit?

12:19.072 --> 12:20.104
Yeah, of course.

12:21.674 --> 12:22.607
You doing okay?

12:24.711 --> 12:28.779
It's been, I had to fire
somebody yesterday, so...

12:28.781 --> 12:29.680
Oh shit.

12:30.683 --> 12:33.451
Business, it's been rough.

12:40.126 --> 12:42.526
I need a little bit of help.

12:43.529 --> 12:44.629
Yeah, how much.

12:44.631 --> 12:45.529
Five grand?

12:48.735 --> 12:50.668
It's a big ask, I get that.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.206
You're gonna go
there today, huh?

12:57.477 --> 12:59.610
I'm just in a
tough spot, okay?

13:01.281 --> 13:03.781
All I'm saying is we got
each other's backs, right?

13:05.084 --> 13:05.983
We always have.

13:07.587 --> 13:08.719
Yeah buddy.

13:11.057 --> 13:12.256
Can I think about it?

13:12.258 --> 13:13.624
Yeah, no totally,
think about it.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.493
- Okay, thank you.
- Think about it for sure.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.067
Yo yo yo!

16:47.273 --> 16:48.839
What's going on?

16:50.943 --> 16:52.476
Stupid.

16:52.478 --> 16:54.278
How's your whole life been?

16:54.280 --> 16:55.112
Fuck.

17:02.688 --> 17:04.255
Can you just do this for me?

17:05.858 --> 17:07.157
Look, I know it's not easy,

17:07.159 --> 17:09.026
but I really think it'll help.

17:10.162 --> 17:12.062
You really can't
do this, can you?

17:15.835 --> 17:18.469
Logan, please,
just make an effort.

17:18.471 --> 17:19.403
That's all I'm asking.

17:19.405 --> 17:21.038
An effort?

17:21.040 --> 17:22.706
Okay, I'll make an effort.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.341
You want to talk, let's talk.

17:24.343 --> 17:26.510
Alright, no stranger
in a room bullshit.

17:26.512 --> 17:27.545
Just you and me, right now.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.013
Let's be honest.

17:29.015 --> 17:30.180
You want to try that?

17:30.182 --> 17:31.849
You think you can do that?

17:31.851 --> 17:32.783
Come on, go ahead.

17:36.822 --> 17:40.457
Just be open, okay?

17:42.328 --> 17:43.227
Good talk.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.866
You know, I'm really glad

17:48.868 --> 17:50.234
you could fit this
into your schedule.

17:51.837 --> 17:53.604
You decorate this
place yourself?

17:54.607 --> 17:55.506
I did.

17:58.744 --> 18:01.845
"Resurrecting Sex."

18:01.847 --> 18:04.114
Sounds like you have
a blast in here, huh?

18:05.718 --> 18:09.453
Can I go out on a limb and
take a little guess here?

18:12.358 --> 18:14.024
First therapy session.

18:14.026 --> 18:15.059
Can you tell?

18:15.061 --> 18:16.126
Yeah I can tell.

18:17.597 --> 18:18.562
It's cool, though.

18:18.564 --> 18:20.531
Welcome, welcome to therapy.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.033
I'm glad you came today.

18:23.035 --> 18:24.234
You obviously don't
want to be here,

18:24.236 --> 18:27.371
but I'm glad you came.

18:29.208 --> 18:31.742
Is this what they
tell you in the books?

18:31.744 --> 18:33.010
So I met your mom.

18:35.214 --> 18:38.616
She seems pretty cool.

18:38.618 --> 18:39.950
So Kristen came crying?

18:41.454 --> 18:43.654
I think she just wants
what's best for you.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.823
Kristen's caught
up in her own shit.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.091
I'm caught up in mine.

18:47.093 --> 18:48.325
It's as simple as that.

18:51.497 --> 18:53.497
Is this all confidential?

18:53.499 --> 18:54.398
Yes.

18:55.501 --> 18:57.167
And what did she say about me?

18:57.169 --> 18:59.236
Ah, see here's the thing.

19:00.172 --> 19:02.272
It's confidential for her, too.

19:02.274 --> 19:04.675
I know, it's annoying,
but it's fair.

19:05.945 --> 19:07.645
In that case, you
have my permission

19:07.647 --> 19:09.313
to tell her that she's a bitch.

19:11.417 --> 19:12.816
Okay.

19:12.818 --> 19:13.717
So.

19:16.088 --> 19:17.321
We have an hour.

19:17.323 --> 19:19.657
That's my only
job, is to listen.

19:21.360 --> 19:22.359
What you got?

19:24.664 --> 19:26.330
I got nothing to say, really.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.066
Great.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.409
Oh, that's so much better.

19:49.155 --> 19:50.721
Must meet a lot
of fucked up people here.

19:50.723 --> 19:53.490
Yeah.

19:53.492 --> 19:54.892
I guess you could say that.

19:56.062 --> 19:56.960
Not married?

19:59.165 --> 20:00.664
You know, I think I'm supposed

20:00.666 --> 20:02.733
to be the one asking the
questions here, actually.

20:02.735 --> 20:03.767
I just remembered.

20:05.337 --> 20:06.570
What about you?

20:06.572 --> 20:07.871
I don't see a ring
on your finger.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.840
I'm 17, thank you.

20:09.842 --> 20:12.976
Oh, okay.

20:12.978 --> 20:15.179
No come on, you got like a...

20:15.181 --> 20:16.180
You got a person?

20:16.182 --> 20:18.082
You got a significant other?

20:19.018 --> 20:20.317
There's a girl.

20:20.319 --> 20:23.420
I don't know about a
girlfriend, per se.

20:23.422 --> 20:25.355
What's this girl's name?

20:25.357 --> 20:26.256
Megan.

20:27.193 --> 20:28.158
Megan.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.028
Nice.

20:31.030 --> 20:32.563
Have you told her
how you feel yet?

20:32.565 --> 20:33.464
No.

20:34.500 --> 20:35.399
Why not?

20:36.335 --> 20:37.267
'Cause it's still new.

20:37.269 --> 20:38.569
I don't want to fuck things up.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.671
I'm afraid she's not
gonna feel the same way.

20:42.241 --> 20:46.276
So, one way to go here.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.346
Next time you're with Megan,

20:50.683 --> 20:55.018
and you feel like
telling her, tell her.

20:56.722 --> 20:57.955
But I don't know
how she feels.

20:57.957 --> 20:59.623
No no, see that's
not the point, though.

21:00.760 --> 21:01.625
What matters is how you feel.

21:05.364 --> 21:07.064
Your mom told me
that she recently

21:07.066 --> 21:08.632
told you about your adoption.

21:13.105 --> 21:16.340
How are you feeling about her?

21:18.444 --> 21:19.810
Your birth mother.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.546
I don't care one
way or another.

21:22.548 --> 21:24.481
What's done is done.

21:24.483 --> 21:25.783
You don't care at all?

21:27.386 --> 21:28.285
Are we done?

21:29.555 --> 21:30.454
'Cause I feel like we're done.

21:30.456 --> 21:31.655
We still have plenty of time.

21:31.657 --> 21:33.490
Look, I came here
and did my part.

21:33.492 --> 21:35.259
You have my permission
to tell Kristen that.

21:35.261 --> 21:36.593
Okay, we can end early,

21:36.595 --> 21:39.329
but I just, one more
question before you go, okay?

21:40.966 --> 21:43.734
Have you considered
making contact?

21:43.736 --> 21:45.269
Jesus Christ.

21:45.271 --> 21:46.937
It's not like it
would change anything.

21:46.939 --> 21:48.138
We can talk about
it more next time.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.140
I'd really love to
see you again, Logan.

21:59.118 --> 21:59.983
Fuck.

22:10.663 --> 22:11.495
I like it.

22:11.497 --> 22:12.496
They're pretty good.

22:12.498 --> 22:14.898
Yeah, they're pretty good.

22:27.713 --> 22:31.615
Do you want to hang
out later, or something?

22:37.723 --> 22:39.122
What?

22:39.124 --> 22:41.291
It means yeah sure in French.

22:41.293 --> 22:42.492
Oh.

22:42.494 --> 22:44.995
Someone didn't
take French class.

24:32.738 --> 24:33.637
Jesus, dude.

24:33.639 --> 24:35.639
You scared the shit out of me.

24:35.641 --> 24:37.174
No, help yourself.

24:37.176 --> 24:39.843
I tried ringing the doorbell,
but you weren't answering.

24:40.746 --> 24:42.346
What's up?

24:45.284 --> 24:46.450
Who's that for?

24:46.452 --> 24:49.186
Oh, it's just a friend.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.924
Ariane, should I
be worried about you?

24:55.327 --> 24:59.496
No, by the way, your check
is on top of the microwave.

24:59.498 --> 25:02.132
No seriously, dude,
I have to go to bed.

25:02.134 --> 25:03.200
I'm exhausted.

25:04.536 --> 25:05.836
It took me years
to get you back.

25:05.838 --> 25:08.205
I don't know what
the fuck that is.

25:08.207 --> 25:10.374
I'm fine, okay?

25:11.477 --> 25:13.143
Please just take
what you came for,

25:13.145 --> 25:15.512
and please go.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.849
You're shutting me out.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.420
You know, you did
this last time.

25:24.523 --> 25:25.389
Remember?

25:26.825 --> 25:30.193
You shut me out and I had
to fucking force my way in.

25:30.195 --> 25:32.095
And Ariane, you know,

25:33.799 --> 25:35.999
I barely got to you in time.

25:36.001 --> 25:38.468
So maybe this time
around, Ariane, please.

25:39.738 --> 25:41.271
Maybe just fucking let me in.

25:45.344 --> 25:49.046
Ariane, just tell me what
the fuck's going on here.

25:51.083 --> 25:54.317
Just tell me what
the fuck's going on.

25:55.521 --> 25:58.155
It's nothing, okay?

26:08.367 --> 26:10.100
It's just this patient.

26:12.938 --> 26:14.237
This high school kid.

26:16.208 --> 26:18.642
He just found out
he was adopted.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.479
I can relate.

26:24.450 --> 26:29.019
So maybe that's what you're
feeling with me right now?

26:38.363 --> 26:39.262
Look, Ariane.

26:40.365 --> 26:43.400
I am always gonna
be here for you.

26:43.402 --> 26:46.136
Always, that is
not gonna change.

26:49.241 --> 26:50.974
But I need you to
be careful that

26:53.278 --> 26:58.215
this thing, that it
doesn't fuck you up.

27:02.988 --> 27:06.490
I'm not going there
right now with you.

27:08.093 --> 27:09.059
Okay, Ariane.

27:11.463 --> 27:15.065
Not every kid that you
cross paths with is yours.

27:16.835 --> 27:19.169
You think I don't know that?

27:22.007 --> 27:23.507
It's been 17 years, Ariane.

27:25.744 --> 27:28.745
You need to start
taking steps to move on.

27:32.284 --> 27:33.183
Please.

27:34.620 --> 27:36.219
Leave that kid the fuck alone.

27:57.109 --> 27:58.008
Hey.

27:59.111 --> 28:01.044
You look pretty
good on that thing.

28:01.046 --> 28:01.878
Thanks.

28:04.149 --> 28:06.016
Liam said you'd
probably be here.

28:08.153 --> 28:10.387
I was just gonna do some
studying for midterms,

28:10.389 --> 28:12.989
and thought that maybe
you'd want to come join?

28:12.991 --> 28:13.890
Yeah.

28:15.027 --> 28:16.526
I like that.

28:17.863 --> 28:19.529
Okay.

28:19.531 --> 28:22.399
So, are you gonna give me a
ride on this thing, or what?

28:29.474 --> 28:30.373
Hop to the back?

28:31.510 --> 28:33.310
Okay.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.760
You know, you were cute
for a second there,

28:50.762 --> 28:51.861
and then you just
messed that up.

28:51.863 --> 28:53.430
- I lost it?
- Yeah.

28:53.432 --> 28:55.298
I have to try a
little bit harder, then.

28:58.604 --> 28:59.502
Oh, oh.

29:02.207 --> 29:03.340
Your hands are cold.

29:05.544 --> 29:08.678
This creep is following me!

29:12.551 --> 29:15.385
What, you act like you don't
want to get in the water.

29:15.387 --> 29:16.586
For somebody who has jeans on,

29:16.588 --> 29:17.687
I don't know if I...

29:17.689 --> 29:19.289
Jeans?

29:19.291 --> 29:20.557
That's what I got.

29:20.559 --> 29:22.058
You want me to take 'em off?

29:27.132 --> 29:29.633
You know what you're doing.

30:38.470 --> 30:39.569
I love you.

30:40.972 --> 30:42.605
Wait, what?

30:42.607 --> 30:44.374
I love you.

30:44.376 --> 30:45.241
What?

30:47.045 --> 30:47.911
What?

30:49.848 --> 30:50.814
No, no.

30:50.816 --> 30:51.681
Hold on.

30:56.355 --> 30:57.387
I think...

30:59.157 --> 31:00.757
I think we made a mistake.

31:01.827 --> 31:04.260
What do you mean a mistake?

31:09.301 --> 31:13.103
What we have,
it's not serious.

31:16.007 --> 31:16.840
Right?

31:16.842 --> 31:17.741
Don't bullshit me.

31:18.677 --> 31:19.576
Logan.

31:21.313 --> 31:24.381
Seriously?

31:54.212 --> 31:55.111
Hey.

31:57.616 --> 31:58.481
You going out?

31:59.918 --> 32:02.619
No, I just got, I was just
about to hop in the shower.

32:02.621 --> 32:03.787
Huh.

32:06.057 --> 32:07.190
I ran into Kyle.

32:08.960 --> 32:10.627
And?

32:10.629 --> 32:14.931
And, fuck, Ariane, maybe
give this guy a chance.

32:14.933 --> 32:17.133
He says you're giving
him the cold shoulder.

32:17.135 --> 32:18.301
That's the reason
why you drove

32:18.303 --> 32:19.803
all the way out here,
to tell me that?

32:19.805 --> 32:21.638
- Well.
- Hey, I'll tell you what.

32:22.774 --> 32:25.542
If I want to talk to
either of you guys,

32:25.544 --> 32:28.278
you'll be the first
to know, okay?

32:28.280 --> 32:31.748
Alright, okay, just listen
for a second, alright?

32:31.750 --> 32:33.483
Did you think about the thing

32:33.485 --> 32:35.385
that we talked about
the other night?

32:37.923 --> 32:39.489
Yeah.

32:39.491 --> 32:42.225
I actually referred him
to another therapist.

32:42.994 --> 32:46.563
So, happy?

32:46.565 --> 32:48.798
Yeah, wow, fuck, good.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.267
Yeah, no, that's good.

32:51.269 --> 32:53.803
Awesome, wow, I'm
proud of you, really.

32:55.941 --> 32:56.840
In other news,

32:59.511 --> 33:01.311
I think I may have
found someone.

33:02.347 --> 33:04.280
So what, you want
me to meet her?

33:04.282 --> 33:06.015
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, I do.

33:06.952 --> 33:07.851
When?

33:08.987 --> 33:10.053
Next week.

33:12.023 --> 33:13.990
Next week, yeah,
I'll make it work.

33:14.926 --> 33:19.863
Cool.

33:23.468 --> 33:24.801
Hello?

33:26.204 --> 33:28.505
Halle-fucking-lujah.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.607
Your phone works.

33:30.609 --> 33:31.441
That's awesome.

33:31.443 --> 33:32.342
That's such good news.

33:32.344 --> 33:35.912
Listen, next time, call first.

33:39.284 --> 33:40.450
I see what you did there.

33:40.452 --> 33:43.119
- That's very funny.
- Yeah, night!

33:43.121 --> 33:45.455
- Very funny, actually I...
- Bye.

33:45.457 --> 33:47.457
Cool, I'll just,
I'll get going.

34:55.360 --> 34:56.259
Shit.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.472
Where have you been all night?

35:09.474 --> 35:11.240
- Out.
- Out, out where?

35:11.242 --> 35:13.309
Do you have any idea
what time it is?

35:14.746 --> 35:16.646
The school called again.

35:16.648 --> 35:18.748
This time to say that
they are seriously

35:18.750 --> 35:21.451
reconsidering your future there.

35:21.453 --> 35:24.053
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

35:24.055 --> 35:26.789
You keep this shit up and
you are gonna get expelled.

35:26.791 --> 35:28.558
What, you think
I don't know that?

35:28.560 --> 35:30.827
Oh don't act like you
are better than this.

35:31.997 --> 35:33.096
Fuck off.

35:33.098 --> 35:34.831
What did you just say to me?

35:34.833 --> 35:36.399
I said leave me
the fuck alone!

35:39.137 --> 35:40.036
Wow.

35:41.773 --> 35:42.972
Congratulations.

35:44.275 --> 35:45.875
You just got yourself grounded.

35:48.113 --> 35:49.312
Oh, and your bike.

35:51.016 --> 35:51.914
Keys.

35:53.284 --> 35:54.183
Now!

37:49.234 --> 37:50.800
Hello?

37:50.802 --> 37:53.569
Hi, could I
speak to Ariane Longwood?

37:53.571 --> 37:55.238
Yeah, yes, this is she.

37:55.240 --> 37:56.739
Hi Ariane.

37:56.741 --> 37:59.308
This is Diane from Family
Care Adoptive Services.

37:59.310 --> 38:00.743
I'm just calling to inform you

38:00.745 --> 38:02.411
that unfortunately your request

38:02.413 --> 38:05.114
to contact the adoptive
family has been denied.

38:11.756 --> 38:14.423
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:14.425 --> 38:15.458
Funny seeing you here.

38:15.460 --> 38:17.794
I was just about to call you.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.595
Oh, I'm sorry.

38:19.597 --> 38:21.063
Are you dropping off your kids?

38:21.065 --> 38:24.433
Oh, it was my
nephew, actually.

38:24.435 --> 38:26.836
I'm helping out
my brother today.

38:26.838 --> 38:29.071
What's up?

38:29.073 --> 38:32.508
I just, I just want
to ask you about Logan.

38:32.510 --> 38:34.443
How you think he's doing.

38:34.445 --> 38:36.245
Right, yeah, you know.

38:36.247 --> 38:38.514
Well, there's only so
much that I can tell you.

38:38.516 --> 38:42.585
- But he is doing great.
- Really?

38:42.587 --> 38:43.519
Honestly, yeah.

38:44.322 --> 38:45.454
He's really mature.

38:45.456 --> 38:47.857
He started opening up.

38:49.627 --> 38:52.461
Wow, okay, that's...

38:52.463 --> 38:55.097
I gotta say, that's
really surprising to hear.

38:55.099 --> 38:57.033
Yeah, you know, I also think

38:58.169 --> 39:02.505
he's ready to meet
his birth mother.

39:04.809 --> 39:05.708
Oh.

39:07.011 --> 39:07.910
Really?

39:08.980 --> 39:10.580
Even in our brief
time together,

39:11.816 --> 39:15.151
you know, I think that
it would be a remarkable

39:15.153 --> 39:16.719
gesture on your part.

39:17.822 --> 39:19.856
And you know, I
think even though

39:19.858 --> 39:21.724
Logan doesn't want to admit it,

39:21.726 --> 39:23.459
I think that it's a huge reason

39:23.461 --> 39:24.360
that he's been acting out.

39:25.196 --> 39:26.629
So, you know.

39:26.631 --> 39:28.564
Go ahead and think about that.

39:28.566 --> 39:29.498
Be patient.

39:29.500 --> 39:32.001
And we'll figure it out.

39:32.003 --> 39:33.202
Alright,
didn't mean to keep you.

39:33.204 --> 39:34.337
- Hey, you're good.
- Thank you.

39:34.339 --> 39:39.408
Take care.

39:46.217 --> 39:48.951
I'm so excited, are you going?

39:53.024 --> 39:54.323
So why are you not going?

39:54.325 --> 39:55.224
You gotta take somebody.

39:55.226 --> 39:56.859
You want to go?

39:56.861 --> 39:58.594
I mean, you're hot.

39:59.564 --> 40:00.930
Yo, are you good?

40:15.914 --> 40:16.812
Hello?

40:18.082 --> 40:19.615
Hello?

40:19.617 --> 40:22.218
Hey, what the hell
are you doing here?

40:22.220 --> 40:23.519
I know I'm covered in dirt,

40:23.521 --> 40:25.454
- but I need a hug.
- Oh no, come on.

40:25.456 --> 40:27.590
- You smell like garbage.
- I know.

40:27.592 --> 40:28.791
Did you get off of work today?

40:28.793 --> 40:31.227
Yeah, I was just
running some errands.

40:31.229 --> 40:32.461
What are you doing out there?

40:32.463 --> 40:34.563
Oh just burning some
old rotted out wood.

40:34.565 --> 40:36.132
I mean, this whole
fucking place,

40:36.134 --> 40:37.900
- this whole apartment is...
- Uh huh, yeah.

40:37.902 --> 40:41.070
You know what, that
is the one thing

40:41.072 --> 40:43.272
that the old man did correctly.

40:43.274 --> 40:46.309
Pass this piece of shit
on to you, my friend.

40:46.311 --> 40:47.576
Thank God.

40:47.578 --> 40:50.112
I've maintained its
shittiness for 10 years.

40:50.114 --> 40:52.081
If not, more shitty.

40:52.083 --> 40:53.316
Well done.

40:53.318 --> 40:55.952
- Speaking of which.
- Huh?

40:55.954 --> 40:57.920
I got a call from somebody

40:57.922 --> 41:00.556
wanting to buy this shit hole.

41:00.558 --> 41:02.258
Take it, this is a no-brainer.

41:02.260 --> 41:05.061
- I already told 'em no.
- Well you know what?

41:05.063 --> 41:05.962
Fucking fine.

41:05.964 --> 41:07.129
Just give me a lighter.

41:07.131 --> 41:08.464
I'll burn this fucker
down right now.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.466
- Ariane, calm down.
- What?

41:11.769 --> 41:14.837
I really want to raise
a family here one day.

41:16.774 --> 41:17.673
I really do.

41:19.110 --> 41:20.743
Are you fucking with me again?

41:21.846 --> 41:25.781
Maybe I just want
to fix what was broken

41:25.783 --> 41:26.849
and just make it better.

41:26.851 --> 41:28.351
You're serious.

41:29.654 --> 41:30.920
Yeah.

41:30.922 --> 41:33.255
I mean, that's fucking great.

41:33.257 --> 41:35.224
Seriously, that's...

41:36.160 --> 41:37.159
I'm happy for you.

41:38.629 --> 41:41.530
Thanks, we'll see how it goes.

41:41.532 --> 41:43.032
Be careful there.

41:48.506 --> 41:50.706
I haven't thought about
this in a long time.

41:57.815 --> 42:00.216
Remember when dad would
be in one of his moods?

42:03.021 --> 42:06.355
I'd always like, squirrel
myself away under there.

42:11.629 --> 42:13.362
He'd always find me.

42:18.036 --> 42:19.568
Every time, he just knew.

42:25.643 --> 42:26.609
You know.

42:31.849 --> 42:34.250
I really miss him sometimes.

42:41.526 --> 42:42.425
I know.

42:44.162 --> 42:45.061
I know.

42:47.165 --> 42:48.064
I know.

43:08.252 --> 43:09.085
Bring it out!

43:09.087 --> 43:10.052
Falcons on three!

43:10.054 --> 43:11.253
One two three.

43:11.255 --> 43:12.955
Falcons,
Falcons, Falcons.

43:26.304 --> 43:27.770
Hey.

43:27.772 --> 43:28.737
Who's winning?

43:28.739 --> 43:30.005
It's practice, dude.

43:31.142 --> 43:32.041
Oh.

43:33.711 --> 43:35.744
I heard you and Megan
had a thing going on.

43:35.746 --> 43:37.580
What's up with that?

43:37.582 --> 43:38.481
Nothing to say.

43:39.550 --> 43:40.483
Didn't work out.

43:41.619 --> 43:42.785
My first time, I
was like a monkey

43:42.787 --> 43:44.386
trying to fuck a football.

43:44.388 --> 43:46.088
Is that what she's
telling people?

43:46.090 --> 43:47.590
That it was my first time?

43:47.592 --> 43:48.491
I don't know.

43:49.660 --> 43:51.060
Who cares if it was, man?

43:56.434 --> 44:00.002
Hey, No Vacancy is
having an event tonight.

44:01.239 --> 44:02.071
Cool.

44:03.174 --> 44:05.407
You might meet someone
even cuter than Megan.

44:06.777 --> 44:08.410
Dude, I'm just trying to get you

44:08.412 --> 44:09.845
out of your fucking rut.

44:09.847 --> 44:12.414
Dude, you know I saw
you today talking to her.

44:12.416 --> 44:13.315
You guys looked like
you were practically

44:13.317 --> 44:14.483
gonna fuck in the hallway.

44:16.020 --> 44:17.353
So what?

44:17.355 --> 44:19.955
There is nothing going
on with me and Megan.

44:19.957 --> 44:20.890
Relax.

44:26.764 --> 44:27.730
Anyways.

44:29.133 --> 44:33.035
My mom made me start
seeing someone.

44:35.139 --> 44:36.805
You mean like a therapist?

44:36.807 --> 44:38.340
Yeah.

44:38.342 --> 44:40.476
She's actually not that bad.

44:42.480 --> 44:43.562
Is she hot?

44:43.564 --> 44:44.647
Always about being
hot with you, huh?

44:44.649 --> 44:45.581
So she's hot.

44:47.985 --> 44:50.219
So she's hot.

44:51.656 --> 44:52.755
That's all you had to say.

44:59.197 --> 45:00.863
Really?

45:00.865 --> 45:01.897
To new beginnings.

45:03.668 --> 45:06.702
This shit.

45:16.147 --> 45:17.880
Can I see your ID?

47:36.987 --> 47:39.388
- Cheers, love you.
- Cheers.

47:42.293 --> 47:47.363
Fuck.

47:48.332 --> 47:52.067
Fuck, fuck

47:52.069 --> 47:55.003
Fuck.

48:13.691 --> 48:15.357
I feel like I've
tried everything,

48:15.359 --> 48:17.159
and I cannot seem to
get through to him.

48:17.161 --> 48:18.994
And he won't even talk to me.

48:18.996 --> 48:19.928
I mean, what now?

48:22.600 --> 48:23.832
Are you even listening?

48:26.370 --> 48:27.603
Yes, mm-hmm.

48:30.107 --> 48:31.206
So what now?

48:31.208 --> 48:32.441
What now?

48:32.443 --> 48:33.909
What the hell am I
supposed to do now?

48:34.779 --> 48:36.044
Isn't that what I pay you for?

48:36.046 --> 48:38.013
To tell me, to fucking guide me.

48:39.917 --> 48:41.016
But your hour's up.

48:43.287 --> 48:44.787
We're done here, you can go.

48:47.191 --> 48:48.991
What
is wrong with you?

49:14.251 --> 49:15.784
Yeah, yeah what's up?

49:15.786 --> 49:16.652
Hey.

49:17.788 --> 49:19.154
Sorry I missed your
calls last night.

49:19.156 --> 49:20.489
I only just saw 'em now.

49:21.959 --> 49:23.258
You okay?

49:23.260 --> 49:24.493
Oh, yeah.

49:26.096 --> 49:28.630
Someone just broke into my car,

49:28.632 --> 49:30.065
and smashed a window.

49:30.935 --> 49:31.800
Fuck.

49:32.636 --> 49:34.603
Did they get anything?

49:34.605 --> 49:36.738
Oh, just some cash.

49:36.740 --> 49:38.407
But it's fine, I'm fine.

49:39.777 --> 49:41.610
It's actually in the shop
right now getting fixed.

49:41.612 --> 49:45.013
But look, I really gotta go.

49:45.015 --> 49:46.982
Hey hey, wait, wait a second.

49:49.286 --> 49:50.953
I'm taking Stacey out
tonight to dinner,

49:50.955 --> 49:53.288
and it would really
mean a lot to me

49:53.290 --> 49:55.090
if you could be there.

49:55.092 --> 49:56.425
Yeah, yeah just text me.

50:08.372 --> 50:09.271
So.

50:13.210 --> 50:14.109
How are you?

50:16.447 --> 50:17.446
I'm good.

50:23.487 --> 50:26.488
Still don't want
to be here, huh?

50:26.490 --> 50:27.623
I'm here, aren't I?

50:30.794 --> 50:32.394
I'm really glad that you are.

50:40.838 --> 50:42.237
So, do you have anything

50:44.208 --> 50:46.441
in particular you'd
like to discuss today?

50:48.178 --> 50:51.580
Just the fact that I'm a
little mad at you is all.

50:53.551 --> 50:54.650
Mad at me.

50:57.821 --> 50:59.488
After the first
time I saw you,

51:00.724 --> 51:02.858
Megan and I started hanging out.

51:02.860 --> 51:05.494
It was like everything
that I wanted it to be.

51:08.032 --> 51:08.964
What happened?

51:11.435 --> 51:14.236
And one day we
were hooking up,

51:15.539 --> 51:18.740
and I took your
wonderful advice,

51:19.577 --> 51:22.844
and I told her that I loved her.

51:24.682 --> 51:25.781
And she stopped.

51:29.753 --> 51:32.387
Made me feel like
a fucking idiot.

51:32.389 --> 51:34.356
Told me she didn't
want the same thing.

51:36.393 --> 51:38.827
I'm genuinely really
sorry that that happened.

51:42.733 --> 51:45.033
Can I give you another
angle on this, though?

51:47.404 --> 51:49.004
If that was her reaction,

51:51.609 --> 51:53.842
is this somebody you
really want to be with?

51:57.147 --> 52:00.082
I mean, Logan, I honestly think

52:00.084 --> 52:01.650
you should be proud of yourself.

52:02.953 --> 52:04.086
Why?

52:04.088 --> 52:05.053
Okay, it was
fucking humiliating.

52:05.055 --> 52:05.954
Sure.

52:07.891 --> 52:08.824
Of course it was.

52:11.729 --> 52:12.628
But...

52:15.299 --> 52:19.034
What you did, it took
a lot of courage, man.

52:22.439 --> 52:23.338
Okay.

52:29.413 --> 52:31.813
What you did is
one of the most raw

52:31.815 --> 52:34.316
and vulnerable things
that anybody can do.

52:37.154 --> 52:38.620
And sure, you know,

52:38.622 --> 52:40.355
somebody else may have
given you the advice

52:40.357 --> 52:42.090
to wait 'til the right time,

52:42.092 --> 52:43.859
but when the hell is that?

52:46.630 --> 52:48.096
And the people that do that,

52:48.098 --> 52:50.265
they're not waiting
around for the right time

52:50.267 --> 52:51.933
because they're
smarter than you.

52:53.137 --> 52:56.371
They're doing it because
it's easy and it's safe.

52:58.942 --> 53:00.242
But at least you know now.

53:04.181 --> 53:07.249
You didn't wait a
year, wondering.

53:12.656 --> 53:15.057
Honestly, man, I don't know
what's wrong with this girl.

53:16.326 --> 53:18.493
Like, if I was your age,

53:18.495 --> 53:20.095
I would totally date you, okay?

53:24.034 --> 53:25.734
Come on, you're amazing.

53:28.238 --> 53:29.137
Thanks.

53:31.208 --> 53:33.241
And by the way, did
I see you last night?

53:35.345 --> 53:36.378
Where?

53:36.380 --> 53:37.412
No Vacancy.

53:39.750 --> 53:40.982
What's that?

53:40.984 --> 53:41.883
The club.

53:43.987 --> 53:46.588
No, no, nightclub's
not really,

53:48.058 --> 53:49.391
it's not really my thing.

53:51.929 --> 53:54.429
Yeah I was actually
out of town last night.

53:54.431 --> 53:56.631
I was visiting some friends.

53:58.702 --> 53:59.568
Cool.

54:02.106 --> 54:03.772
It's actually pretty nice out.

54:08.011 --> 54:10.178
You want to see
something kind of rad?

54:11.215 --> 54:14.382
Yes, Ariane, I do.

54:14.384 --> 54:15.350
Come on, let's go.

54:26.864 --> 54:27.829
Have you...

54:29.266 --> 54:33.034
Have you thought about
contacting your birth mother?

54:33.036 --> 54:34.269
If it happens, it happens.

54:34.271 --> 54:36.204
Honestly, I just,
I don't feel like

54:37.274 --> 54:38.473
hunting her down.

54:42.246 --> 54:43.445
If you did,

54:47.251 --> 54:48.650
what would you say to her?

54:50.454 --> 54:52.220
I would not know
where to start.

55:19.983 --> 55:20.882
Hey.

55:23.821 --> 55:25.320
It's got my cell on the back.

55:27.024 --> 55:30.358
You can call me
anytime you want, okay?

55:30.360 --> 55:31.259
Day or night.

55:33.263 --> 55:34.796
Careful what you wish for.

55:34.798 --> 55:36.865
- That's all I'm saying.
- Oh, oh!

55:38.202 --> 55:40.101
Alright, sleep's gone.

55:40.103 --> 55:41.303
My life is gone.

55:41.305 --> 55:43.271
- This drama over here.
- I won't abuse it.

55:43.273 --> 55:46.975
I won't abuse it.

55:46.977 --> 55:49.144
- Cool.
- Thanks, by the way.

55:49.146 --> 55:50.545
- Of course.
- Thanks.

55:52.549 --> 55:53.615
Of course.

56:20.510 --> 56:21.409
Whoa.

56:24.147 --> 56:25.513
Wow.

56:25.515 --> 56:27.382
Wow, Ariane.

56:27.384 --> 56:28.583
Fucking wow.

56:28.585 --> 56:29.818
These guys, they work
fast, don't they?

56:29.820 --> 56:32.487
I mean, Jesus,
that's incredible.

56:33.590 --> 56:37.659
I'm sorry, were you
just waiting for me?

56:37.661 --> 56:40.228
What the fuck is
the matter with you?

56:40.230 --> 56:42.931
You tell me, without
lying this time.

56:45.535 --> 56:47.235
I didn't want you
to worry about me.

56:47.237 --> 56:48.870
Oh you didn't want me to
fucking worry about you?

56:48.872 --> 56:50.939
What, do you think
I'm a fucking idiot?

56:51.742 --> 56:53.942
You're being ridiculous.

56:54.878 --> 56:57.212
Get the fuck out of my car.

56:57.214 --> 56:58.747
- Ow.
- You're sick, Ariane.

57:00.050 --> 57:02.751
People like you, they
don't just get better

57:02.753 --> 57:04.252
and go back to being normal.

57:05.222 --> 57:07.355
You're fucking lying to me.

57:07.357 --> 57:09.391
You are lying to the only person

57:09.393 --> 57:11.593
that gives a shit
whether you live or die.

57:11.595 --> 57:13.094
I'm literally the only one

57:13.096 --> 57:15.030
that gives a fuck, Ariane.

57:15.032 --> 57:17.032
You are an addict!

57:17.034 --> 57:18.533
You will always be
a fucking addict

57:18.535 --> 57:21.036
that almost killed
her own fucking kid.

57:21.038 --> 57:22.237
Oh yeah, yeah okay.

57:22.239 --> 57:23.772
You think that
you're all fucking

57:23.774 --> 57:25.440
better now and shit, right?

57:27.244 --> 57:28.743
Bullshit!

57:28.745 --> 57:30.412
Because deep down,
you and I both know,

57:30.414 --> 57:32.981
that you are still
fucked in the head.

58:14.591 --> 58:16.624
Hey, this
is Ariane Longwood.

58:16.626 --> 58:19.294
Leave a message and I'll
get right back to you.

58:23.333 --> 58:25.500
Hey, Ari, it's
Nathan. I am so sorry.

58:25.502 --> 58:27.702
I didn't mean to lose my
temper on you like that.

58:27.704 --> 58:29.537
I just fucking worry
about you sometimes.

58:29.539 --> 58:32.507
Let's move past it, okay?

58:32.509 --> 58:33.775
Dinner is tonight.

58:33.777 --> 58:35.710
I really need you
to be there, please.

58:51.661 --> 58:52.560
Thank you.

58:55.465 --> 58:57.032
One day, I'll show
you what I mean.

58:57.034 --> 58:58.433
He is such a dork.

58:59.236 --> 59:00.402
God, it's so crazy to me

59:00.404 --> 59:02.637
that you guys still
keep in touch.

59:02.639 --> 59:04.072
- You're such opposites.
- I know.

59:05.575 --> 59:08.676
We just grew apart in
so many different ways,

59:08.678 --> 59:12.047
and just live such
different lives now.

59:14.351 --> 59:15.650
He's my friend, I guess.

59:18.422 --> 59:19.421
Real talk, though.

59:21.191 --> 59:22.557
Oh.

59:22.559 --> 59:23.758
Oh, okay.

59:23.760 --> 59:24.392
Just for a minute.

59:27.998 --> 59:29.164
If there's anything I'm doing

59:29.166 --> 59:31.266
that makes you want to leave,

59:31.268 --> 59:35.437
- or makes you uncomfortable...
- Oh God, no no no.

59:36.873 --> 59:37.939
You're fine.

59:43.380 --> 59:45.113
You're amazing, actually.

59:46.583 --> 59:48.283
It's me.

59:53.723 --> 59:55.590
Look, I've just never

59:59.129 --> 1:00:01.629
been good at letting
people get close to me.

1:00:03.733 --> 1:00:06.367
I just didn't want to hurt you.

1:00:07.471 --> 1:00:10.305
So this whole thing
is about protecting me.

1:00:12.242 --> 1:00:14.275
Well, I never
said it was logical.

1:00:16.379 --> 1:00:17.745
Is she actually coming?

1:00:17.747 --> 1:00:18.913
I'm starving.

1:00:18.915 --> 1:00:20.648
We've been sitting here
for like 20 minutes.

1:00:23.086 --> 1:00:24.853
I'll be right back.

1:00:28.158 --> 1:00:30.325
You want to ask me
something, go ahead.

1:00:32.462 --> 1:00:33.361
Anything?

1:00:35.765 --> 1:00:36.664
Shoot.

1:00:44.941 --> 1:00:47.342
You ever thought
about having kids?

1:00:51.815 --> 1:00:52.981
Are you gonna get that?

1:00:52.983 --> 1:00:54.182
No it's fine.

1:00:57.821 --> 1:01:02.090
I'm sorry.

1:01:02.092 --> 1:01:03.124
Just give me a second.

1:01:03.126 --> 1:01:04.025
Yeah.

1:01:11.868 --> 1:01:13.801
- What?
- Where the fuck are you?

1:01:13.803 --> 1:01:16.304
We've been waiting
for 45 minutes.

1:01:16.306 --> 1:01:18.173
Waiting for, what do you...

1:01:19.209 --> 1:01:20.608
Dinner.

1:01:20.610 --> 1:01:21.509
Seriously?

1:01:22.546 --> 1:01:24.479
After the shit you
pulled this afternoon?

1:01:24.481 --> 1:01:26.948
Oh my God, I told
you that I was sorry.

1:01:26.950 --> 1:01:28.449
Okay, what more do you
fucking want from me?

1:01:28.451 --> 1:01:31.352
You know what, just
fuck it, Ariane.

1:01:31.354 --> 1:01:33.888
Do you know why dad couldn't
stomach you as his daughter?

1:01:33.890 --> 1:01:36.157
Okay, because you
are a compulsive liar

1:01:36.159 --> 1:01:37.725
and a selfish brat
that only pretends

1:01:37.727 --> 1:01:39.694
to give a fuck when you're
trying to get your fix.

1:01:39.696 --> 1:01:41.496
And as soon as you do,
you fucking disappear,

1:01:41.498 --> 1:01:43.031
only to be found
again washed up,

1:01:43.033 --> 1:01:44.499
strung out, with your tail
between your fucking legs.

1:01:44.501 --> 1:01:48.203
It's really no wonder
why dad forced you

1:01:48.205 --> 1:01:49.370
to give away your kid.

1:01:59.849 --> 1:02:02.050
Can I have two
tequilas, please?

1:02:05.155 --> 1:02:06.888
Jesus Christ.

1:02:06.890 --> 1:02:08.323
I think you need to slow down.

1:02:08.325 --> 1:02:10.158
I think you need
to step it up.

1:02:10.160 --> 1:02:11.226
Can I have two more?

1:02:14.364 --> 1:02:16.364
Let's go to your room.

1:02:16.366 --> 1:02:18.166
Ariane, stop.

1:02:18.168 --> 1:02:20.034
We said we wouldn't do this.

1:02:20.036 --> 1:02:22.403
I don't want a lecture,
I want to fuck you.

1:02:22.405 --> 1:02:23.371
Stop.

1:02:23.373 --> 1:02:25.940
You know what, don't do this.

1:02:25.942 --> 1:02:27.709
Think about this.

1:02:27.711 --> 1:02:29.210
Look at me, hey.

1:02:29.212 --> 1:02:32.780
Hey you know this isn't
actually going anywhere.

1:02:32.782 --> 1:02:33.615
This doesn't mean anything.

1:02:33.617 --> 1:02:34.782
You get that, right?

1:02:34.784 --> 1:02:36.451
Ariane, just
calm down, alright?

1:02:36.453 --> 1:02:37.585
I hate when people
use my fucking name.

1:02:37.587 --> 1:02:38.786
It's so condescending.

1:02:44.861 --> 1:02:46.160
Don't touch me.

1:02:47.230 --> 1:02:48.263
You know what?

1:02:48.265 --> 1:02:49.697
I'm just gonna call you a cab.

1:02:49.699 --> 1:02:50.665
Fuck off.

1:02:58.942 --> 1:03:02.110
I mean like, when are
these pickles gonna get here?

1:03:02.112 --> 1:03:03.411
I want them fried, though.

1:03:03.413 --> 1:03:04.646
I know.

1:03:04.648 --> 1:03:06.247
You want me to ask
them to fry 'em?

1:03:06.249 --> 1:03:07.482
You can try.

1:03:16.092 --> 1:03:17.325
You wanted me.

1:03:19.162 --> 1:03:20.295
Here I am.

1:03:22.899 --> 1:03:23.798
You're drunk.

1:03:26.102 --> 1:03:27.602
So I guess my brother's
been feeding you

1:03:27.604 --> 1:03:29.771
a bunch of bullshit
about how we make

1:03:29.773 --> 1:03:32.173
an amazing team, right?

1:03:32.175 --> 1:03:33.341
- Actually...
- Babe.

1:03:35.245 --> 1:03:36.144
Just don't.

1:03:37.480 --> 1:03:38.379
Babe.

1:03:41.451 --> 1:03:43.518
Oh my god, so tell
me everything.

1:03:44.788 --> 1:03:46.554
Like how is he as a boyfriend?

1:03:47.791 --> 1:03:49.824
Does he give you a massage?

1:03:51.027 --> 1:03:52.427
Does he make you dinner?

1:03:54.164 --> 1:03:57.131
Like, tell me you
cum first, please.

1:03:57.133 --> 1:03:58.633
Like please.

1:03:58.635 --> 1:03:59.867
It's very important.

1:03:59.869 --> 1:04:02.136
- This is so embarrassing.
- Look.

1:04:02.138 --> 1:04:03.705
Oh come on.

1:04:03.707 --> 1:04:06.541
You know how he got to
be such a prince, right?

1:04:08.311 --> 1:04:10.745
Like, our dad,

1:04:12.482 --> 1:04:15.216
praise that motherfucker, right?

1:04:18.054 --> 1:04:20.888
Oh man, did he tell you what
a hard working man he was?

1:04:22.192 --> 1:04:24.592
How he was always there for us.

1:04:25.662 --> 1:04:27.295
Because if he told you that,

1:04:29.733 --> 1:04:34.335
he's a lying piece of shit.

1:04:34.337 --> 1:04:38.406
Our dad was a
manipulative, abusive cunt,

1:04:39.509 --> 1:04:41.175
who was only ever
good at making people

1:04:41.177 --> 1:04:42.744
feel fucking worthless.

1:04:43.813 --> 1:04:46.714
Now, see, no he
spared your boyfriend,

1:04:47.751 --> 1:04:50.852
but according to
our last phone call,

1:04:50.854 --> 1:04:53.221
the apple doesn't fall
too far from the tree.

1:04:54.524 --> 1:04:56.557
His moral compass
seemed to be pretty intact

1:04:56.559 --> 1:04:58.926
the night you were high
as fuck and in labor.

1:05:01.030 --> 1:05:02.163
Oh shit.

1:05:05.935 --> 1:05:09.437
Oh I like her.

1:05:09.439 --> 1:05:13.674
See, Stace, here's the thing,
though, about all that.

1:05:15.211 --> 1:05:16.978
I'm a grown ass woman now.

1:05:18.114 --> 1:05:20.948
I moved on.

1:05:22.218 --> 1:05:23.151
This one,

1:05:26.055 --> 1:05:27.488
still circling the drain.

1:05:31.694 --> 1:05:33.828
See, he still needs
me to need him,

1:05:36.433 --> 1:05:37.498
but I don't.

1:05:47.377 --> 1:05:51.546
You think that makes
us about square, Nate?

1:06:25.281 --> 1:06:26.681
I can't do this.

1:06:56.679 --> 1:06:57.879
You've reached Logan.

1:06:57.881 --> 1:06:59.780
Leave me your number
and I'll call you back.

1:07:00.617 --> 1:07:02.984
Hey sweetie, it's mom.

1:07:02.986 --> 1:07:04.886
I just want to know
that you're okay.

1:07:07.657 --> 1:07:08.856
Give me a call.

1:07:08.858 --> 1:07:11.959
Just let me know
that you're alright.

1:07:12.862 --> 1:07:14.929
Just call me back, okay?

1:07:20.503 --> 1:07:21.769
I need to talk to you.

1:07:22.839 --> 1:07:23.738
Sure.

1:07:25.074 --> 1:07:25.973
You alright?

1:07:27.977 --> 1:07:28.910
Yeah, I'm fine.

1:07:30.213 --> 1:07:32.413
Somebody called,
concerned about you.

1:07:34.517 --> 1:07:35.883
Who?

1:07:35.885 --> 1:07:37.952
The who doesn't really
matter now, does it?

1:07:41.190 --> 1:07:42.657
You know how this works.

1:07:42.659 --> 1:07:44.692
I've got to take this seriously.

1:07:44.694 --> 1:07:48.229
So why don't you go home
and clear your head?

1:07:48.231 --> 1:07:49.864
That way, you can
come back tomorrow

1:07:49.866 --> 1:07:52.433
and be more on point, okay?

1:08:23.266 --> 1:08:24.298
Are you serious?

1:08:25.535 --> 1:08:26.434
Are you fucking serious?

1:08:26.436 --> 1:08:27.702
Ariane, just calm down, okay?

1:08:27.704 --> 1:08:29.437
What's your problem, huh?

1:08:29.439 --> 1:08:30.705
Fucking my life
isn't enough for you,

1:08:30.707 --> 1:08:32.707
now you're gonna fuck
with my fucking job?

1:08:32.709 --> 1:08:34.108
Stay out of my shit.

1:08:37.313 --> 1:08:38.212
Get a life, dude.

1:09:01.304 --> 1:09:02.169
Logan!

1:09:08.945 --> 1:09:10.311
Excuse me.

1:09:12.448 --> 1:09:14.081
You looked
amazing out there.

1:09:14.083 --> 1:09:16.283
That's intense
man, that's crazy.

1:09:16.285 --> 1:09:18.586
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1:09:21.024 --> 1:09:22.490
I'm very impressed.

1:09:23.626 --> 1:09:25.092
I didn't know you could
do all that crazy stuff.

1:09:25.094 --> 1:09:26.794
What are
you doing here?

1:09:26.796 --> 1:09:28.629
- Huh?
- What are you doing here?

1:09:28.631 --> 1:09:30.698
Oh yeah, I know, I know.

1:09:30.700 --> 1:09:34.702
I have this friend with

1:09:34.704 --> 1:09:38.873
a really fancy car and a really
desperate mid-life crisis.

1:09:40.043 --> 1:09:41.475
I get it.

1:09:41.477 --> 1:09:42.777
But I've never seen
motocross before.

1:09:42.779 --> 1:09:44.912
It's really dangerous.

1:09:45.715 --> 1:09:46.981
Yeah, I don't know.

1:09:46.983 --> 1:09:49.150
It gets me out of
my mind, you know?

1:09:49.152 --> 1:09:50.885
I just don't want to
be at home right now.

1:09:55.324 --> 1:09:56.223
I do know that.

1:10:05.735 --> 1:10:07.835
Do you want to get out of here?

1:10:07.837 --> 1:10:08.736
Go hang out.

1:10:10.506 --> 1:10:11.872
You want to hang out with me?

1:10:11.874 --> 1:10:14.508
Yes, you and me, hang out.

1:10:14.510 --> 1:10:15.876
Just blow off some steam.

1:10:17.313 --> 1:10:18.846
Yeah, sure.

1:10:18.848 --> 1:10:20.915
- For real?
- For real.

1:10:20.917 --> 1:10:23.117
- Alright.
- What do you got in mind?

1:10:24.020 --> 1:10:25.086
Kicking your butt.

1:10:25.855 --> 1:10:26.754
Let's go.

1:10:30.993 --> 1:10:31.892
Come on.

1:10:32.929 --> 1:10:34.762
A little bit?

1:10:34.764 --> 1:10:37.064
No never in a million years
did I think that we were gonna

1:10:37.066 --> 1:10:37.932
be hanging out.

1:10:37.934 --> 1:10:39.200
Yeah it's cool, right?

1:10:39.202 --> 1:10:40.901
Hey, I gotta take
this phone call.

1:10:40.903 --> 1:10:42.870
Just hang out for a second.

1:10:42.872 --> 1:10:44.171
- Do your thing.
- I'll be right there.

1:10:49.011 --> 1:10:50.044
Hello?

1:10:50.046 --> 1:10:51.078
Hi, hi.

1:10:51.080 --> 1:10:53.414
I'm really sorry to bother you.

1:10:53.416 --> 1:10:54.515
I just...

1:10:56.719 --> 1:11:00.788
I think maybe Logan
ran away, and I just,

1:11:00.790 --> 1:11:02.723
he's not answering his phone.

1:11:02.725 --> 1:11:05.760
Oh okay, just
take a deep breath.

1:11:06.963 --> 1:11:09.930
Have you tried calling
his friends, or...

1:11:09.932 --> 1:11:12.299
Yeah, I have called
everyone I can think of,

1:11:12.301 --> 1:11:15.703
and I just wondered
if there was anything

1:11:15.705 --> 1:11:17.371
that he said to you,

1:11:17.373 --> 1:11:19.306
and anything at all.

1:11:21.811 --> 1:11:23.811
Nothing that I can think of.

1:11:23.813 --> 1:11:25.379
I'm sure he'll turn up, though.

1:11:25.381 --> 1:11:28.315
He probably just
needed a little space.

1:11:28.317 --> 1:11:29.817
Now, are you sure he
didn't say anything,

1:11:29.819 --> 1:11:31.719
because I really
need to find him.

1:11:33.756 --> 1:11:34.588
You know, I have
no reason to believe

1:11:34.590 --> 1:11:36.423
that he's in any danger.

1:11:36.425 --> 1:11:37.658
Okay?

1:11:37.660 --> 1:11:40.161
You probably just need
to be a little patient.

1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:45.032
Look, I have to go.

1:11:46.469 --> 1:11:47.902
If I think of anything, I
will call you immediately.

1:11:47.904 --> 1:11:50.271
Okay, I'm sorry,
I have a client.

1:11:54.143 --> 1:11:55.209
Are you kidding me?

1:11:59.115 --> 1:12:00.114
You ready to get schooled?

1:12:00.116 --> 1:12:02.650
Let's do this.

1:12:02.652 --> 1:12:04.118
I think you should
be a little afraid.

1:12:04.120 --> 1:12:04.952
Oh really?

1:12:04.954 --> 1:12:05.920
I don't know.

1:12:05.922 --> 1:12:07.621
I just got an inkling.

1:12:07.623 --> 1:12:10.124
Okay, alright, I
see how this works.

1:12:21.137 --> 1:12:22.870
I'm gonna need all the
luck I can get on this one.

1:12:24.473 --> 1:12:26.273
That's what's up,
that's what's up.

1:12:26.275 --> 1:12:28.008
See, you got this.

1:12:33.649 --> 1:12:34.548
Hello?

1:12:44.827 --> 1:12:46.727
Logan, Logan, Logan.

1:12:47.964 --> 1:12:48.863
Oh I'm not feeling that.

1:12:48.865 --> 1:12:50.564
I am not feeling that at all.

1:12:50.566 --> 1:12:51.832
You ready?

1:12:51.834 --> 1:12:53.133
That does not
look like inner space.

1:12:53.135 --> 1:12:54.501
That looks like an
internment space.

1:12:54.503 --> 1:12:56.036
Are you ready for this?

1:12:57.373 --> 1:12:58.339
Yeah.

1:12:58.341 --> 1:12:59.707
You actually got me a strike.

1:12:59.709 --> 1:13:01.542
Oh I did.

1:13:01.544 --> 1:13:02.977
- There it is, there it is.
- You got it you got it

1:13:02.979 --> 1:13:04.678
you got it you got it.

1:13:36.212 --> 1:13:37.111
Yes!

1:13:40.549 --> 1:13:44.184
- Incredibly impressed.
- Thank you.

1:13:48.691 --> 1:13:50.391
Excuse me, are you recording?

1:13:50.393 --> 1:13:51.625
What?

1:13:51.627 --> 1:13:52.426
You've been up
here half an hour,

1:13:52.428 --> 1:13:53.394
and my kid's down there.

1:13:53.396 --> 1:13:54.528
Stop fucking recording my kid.

1:13:54.530 --> 1:13:56.063
- It's creepy.
- Oh shit.

1:13:56.065 --> 1:13:57.064
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:13:57.066 --> 1:13:58.299
- It's weird.
- Yeah sorry.

1:14:04.373 --> 1:14:05.272
Hey.

1:14:06.575 --> 1:14:10.544
I can't believe it,
you're 15 years old.

1:14:10.546 --> 1:14:11.378
Oh my gosh.

1:14:12.248 --> 1:14:14.281
You're becoming a man.

1:14:14.283 --> 1:14:16.450
Yeah, so this right
here is my little

1:14:17.653 --> 1:14:20.054
Buddha zen zone thing.

1:14:20.056 --> 1:14:22.356
I just got this cool house.

1:14:23.426 --> 1:14:25.359
I made sure there
was an extra bedroom.

1:14:26.295 --> 1:14:27.361
Just in case.

1:14:28.931 --> 1:14:30.230
Happy birthday.

1:14:32.168 --> 1:14:33.767
Yes.

1:14:33.769 --> 1:14:35.502
Okay, okay.

1:14:35.504 --> 1:14:36.670
Get that bottom row.

1:14:36.672 --> 1:14:38.138
- Oh there it is.
- How's my time?

1:14:38.140 --> 1:14:39.306
How's my time, how's my time?

1:14:39.308 --> 1:14:40.374
This is horribly embarrassing.

1:14:42.144 --> 1:14:44.945
My dad once warned
me that if I brought

1:14:44.947 --> 1:14:46.447
a child into this world,

1:14:46.449 --> 1:14:49.550
that my life would be ruined
just like I ruined his.

1:14:51.954 --> 1:14:52.987
That's cute, right?

1:14:57.593 --> 1:14:58.525
He wanted me to...

1:15:03.532 --> 1:15:04.431
He was wrong.

1:15:07.203 --> 1:15:09.737
I was never gonna let him
tell me what to do with you.

1:15:17.480 --> 1:15:19.613
Maybe I don't deserve it.

1:15:21.050 --> 1:15:22.249
Having him close to me.

1:15:27.356 --> 1:15:28.522
Every year I reach out,

1:15:28.524 --> 1:15:30.424
every year your
records remain sealed.

1:15:33.362 --> 1:15:34.728
Not knowing where you are.

1:15:37.333 --> 1:15:38.899
What you may imagine about me.

1:15:40.736 --> 1:15:41.969
Why I did what I did.

1:15:44.740 --> 1:15:46.240
Not knowing how to reach you.

1:15:47.810 --> 1:15:48.876
Love that.

1:15:49.678 --> 1:15:51.045
Maybe my dad was right.

1:15:54.683 --> 1:15:55.749
I really screwed up.

1:16:00.056 --> 1:16:01.221
It's better this way.

1:16:01.223 --> 1:16:02.923
I don't deserve you.

1:16:07.763 --> 1:16:10.497
Man, that was the most
fun I've had in years.

1:16:10.499 --> 1:16:11.832
Yeah, no I needed that.

1:16:17.006 --> 1:16:18.305
Can I tell you a story?

1:16:19.375 --> 1:16:20.874
Go for it.

1:16:20.876 --> 1:16:23.944
About your age, I took
my brother's truck out,

1:16:26.048 --> 1:16:27.981
just to drive around,
clear my head,

1:16:29.351 --> 1:16:33.954
and this dog just ran
right out in front of me.

1:16:36.025 --> 1:16:37.291
And I backed up to see better,

1:16:37.293 --> 1:16:39.159
if there was anything
that I could...

1:16:42.865 --> 1:16:44.331
But I didn't know what to do.

1:16:46.102 --> 1:16:49.470
And I panicked and
I just drove off.

1:16:51.240 --> 1:16:53.440
And left it there on
the side of the road.

1:16:56.712 --> 1:16:58.312
I never told
anybody that before.

1:17:03.586 --> 1:17:04.534
I'm sorry.

1:17:04.536 --> 1:17:05.485
I don't really
remember what I was...

1:17:06.922 --> 1:17:11.992
I guess, I guess what
I'm trying to say is that

1:17:14.763 --> 1:17:16.763
everyone has those
points in their life

1:17:16.765 --> 1:17:20.634
where they feel like
it's too much to handle.

1:17:22.104 --> 1:17:24.004
And I guess I just
wanted you to know

1:17:27.276 --> 1:17:28.709
everything is temporary.

1:17:30.846 --> 1:17:31.745
Okay?

1:17:34.617 --> 1:17:36.016
Did you ever
want to have kids?

1:17:40.956 --> 1:17:41.855
I did.

1:17:45.027 --> 1:17:47.594
I think you'd be a cool mom.

1:17:59.475 --> 1:18:01.708
I have something for you.

1:18:07.716 --> 1:18:08.615
Know what?

1:18:09.685 --> 1:18:12.686
Just wait here,
I'll be right back.

1:18:20.796 --> 1:18:22.029
I don't know what you want,

1:18:22.031 --> 1:18:23.397
but I can't do this
with you right now.

1:18:37.846 --> 1:18:38.745
Ariane.

1:18:40.349 --> 1:18:41.248
You're sick.

1:18:42.351 --> 1:18:43.517
That's it.

1:18:43.519 --> 1:18:44.651
I'm changing the code.

1:18:44.653 --> 1:18:46.753
Ariane, you need help.

1:18:50.859 --> 1:18:53.260
Do you have any idea how
insane this makes you look?

1:19:02.738 --> 1:19:04.871
You don't know what you're
talking about, Nathan.

1:19:04.873 --> 1:19:06.773
Can I please just
get back to my car

1:19:06.775 --> 1:19:07.874
and go on with my day?

1:19:07.876 --> 1:19:10.177
- Look, I got shit to do.
- Wait, wait.

1:19:10.179 --> 1:19:11.979
You brought him here?

1:19:15.050 --> 1:19:17.017
- Let me out!
- Are you fucking crazy?

1:19:17.019 --> 1:19:18.252
- Let me out!
- Are you fucking crazy?

1:19:18.254 --> 1:19:20.120
- Let me out of here.
- You're not going

1:19:20.122 --> 1:19:23.190
- fucking anywhere, Ariane.
- Let go of me!

1:19:23.192 --> 1:19:24.091
Hey!

1:19:25.728 --> 1:19:26.560
You're gonna hate me now,

1:19:26.562 --> 1:19:29.263
but one day, Ariane,

1:19:29.265 --> 1:19:30.530
maybe you're gonna
fucking understand

1:19:30.532 --> 1:19:31.732
because that kid's mother

1:19:31.734 --> 1:19:33.133
deserves to know what
the fuck's going on.

1:19:33.135 --> 1:19:34.368
- What are you gonna...
- Hey!

1:19:34.370 --> 1:19:35.469
Nathan, don't!

1:19:39.241 --> 1:19:42.075
Hey, get in my truck,
I'm taking you home.

1:19:42.077 --> 1:19:43.143
Who the hell are you?

1:19:43.145 --> 1:19:44.411
Now.

1:19:44.413 --> 1:19:46.280
Don't you dare
fucking talk to him.

1:19:47.616 --> 1:19:49.916
Hey, go ahead and get in my car.

1:19:49.918 --> 1:19:53.153
Come on, let's go, let's go.

1:20:16.779 --> 1:20:17.678
Hey.

1:20:23.986 --> 1:20:26.486
I'm really sorry you had
to see that back there.

1:20:27.690 --> 1:20:28.755
It's totally cool.

1:20:30.292 --> 1:20:31.858
I've actually seen worse.

1:20:38.033 --> 1:20:40.534
I had an amazing
time today, though.

1:20:40.536 --> 1:20:41.401
Yeah.

1:20:42.304 --> 1:20:43.236
Today was amazing.

1:20:45.874 --> 1:20:47.240
Can I get a hug?

1:20:48.177 --> 1:20:49.042
Yeah.

1:21:08.864 --> 1:21:12.899
This is not how I
expected tonight to end.

1:21:17.206 --> 1:21:18.472
Me neither.

1:21:23.379 --> 1:21:24.277
Wait.

1:21:28.250 --> 1:21:29.116
No.

1:21:31.520 --> 1:21:32.419
Shit.

1:21:34.690 --> 1:21:36.556
I'm so sorry.

1:21:36.558 --> 1:21:37.891
Logan, Logan!

1:21:40.329 --> 1:21:43.497
Oh shit.

1:21:43.499 --> 1:21:44.898
- Logan.
- Are you alright?

1:21:44.900 --> 1:21:46.166
- Logan, sweetie, please.
- Go inside, Logan.

1:21:46.168 --> 1:21:47.401
You, you stay right
the fuck there.

1:21:47.403 --> 1:21:48.702
I need to talk to him.

1:21:48.704 --> 1:21:50.537
You were with him this
whole time, weren't you?

1:21:50.539 --> 1:21:52.572
Look I just, don't touch me!

1:21:53.675 --> 1:21:56.510
I am not leaving until
I talk to my son.

1:21:58.514 --> 1:21:59.595
What?

1:21:59.597 --> 1:22:00.679
He's my son, and
I am not leaving

1:22:00.682 --> 1:22:01.848
until I talk to him.

1:22:01.850 --> 1:22:03.617
You are not his mother.

1:22:04.386 --> 1:22:05.786
I spoke with her.

1:22:07.723 --> 1:22:09.055
You're lying.

1:22:09.057 --> 1:22:12.225
After you told me to,
I got in touch with her.

1:22:12.227 --> 1:22:13.126
What?

1:22:14.263 --> 1:22:16.563
And you listen to
me. He is not yours.

1:22:16.565 --> 1:22:18.398
I don't know what is
going on inside your head,

1:22:18.400 --> 1:22:20.300
but he is not yours.

1:22:20.302 --> 1:22:22.035
Now you have five
seconds to leave

1:22:22.037 --> 1:22:23.437
before I call the cops.

1:22:23.439 --> 1:22:24.438
You are done.

1:22:25.541 --> 1:22:27.707
You contact him, speak to him,

1:22:27.709 --> 1:22:29.276
even think about him again,

1:22:29.278 --> 1:22:30.877
and I will come after you.

1:23:24.466 --> 1:23:27.300
Uh uh, you can't be here.

1:23:27.302 --> 1:23:29.069
- Why?
- What do you mean why?

1:23:30.005 --> 1:23:32.138
- Why, yeah.
- Because he's a minor.

1:23:32.140 --> 1:23:33.874
Because she could press charges.

1:23:33.876 --> 1:23:37.210
Because I am now obligated
to report you to the board.

1:23:40.315 --> 1:23:43.216
- You have one hour.
- Please, come on.

1:23:43.218 --> 1:23:45.018
I'll do whatever I
have to do, please.

1:23:45.020 --> 1:23:45.919
I need this.

1:23:47.823 --> 1:23:50.824
I got a client there
who's threatening to sue us.

1:23:50.826 --> 1:23:51.725
Fuck.

1:23:53.328 --> 1:23:54.895
What am I gonna tell her?

1:23:55.964 --> 1:23:57.564
James, I thought
he was my son.

1:23:58.700 --> 1:24:00.567
I thought he was my baby boy.

1:24:00.569 --> 1:24:01.835
- You thought?
- Yes.

1:24:01.837 --> 1:24:04.804
You threw it all away
because you thought.

1:24:04.806 --> 1:24:06.673
Is that what I'm supposed
to tell the board

1:24:06.675 --> 1:24:08.041
when I go before them?

1:24:08.043 --> 1:24:10.076
Give her another chance.

1:24:10.078 --> 1:24:12.145
She's a good therapist.

1:24:12.147 --> 1:24:14.814
She knows boundaries.

1:24:14.816 --> 1:24:16.449
Is that what you want me to say?

1:24:17.686 --> 1:24:18.585
I don't know.

1:24:20.355 --> 1:24:21.254
I don't know.

1:24:23.926 --> 1:24:26.059
I trusted you, we trusted you.

1:24:30.032 --> 1:24:30.931
I know.

1:24:33.201 --> 1:24:35.335
I know, James, I'm sorry.

1:25:16.244 --> 1:25:19.779
♪ We still
can't hear you ♪

1:25:19.781 --> 1:25:22.382
♪ We are number one ♪

1:26:22.277 --> 1:26:23.510
- That was really fun.
- Yeah.

1:26:23.512 --> 1:26:26.012
That was actually really fun.

1:26:27.683 --> 1:26:30.116
Really? Out of all the
girls, you had to go for her?

1:26:30.118 --> 1:26:32.118
Logan, what the hell?

1:26:32.120 --> 1:26:33.019
- Stop!
- What?

1:26:33.021 --> 1:26:33.987
With him, it's different?

1:26:33.989 --> 1:26:35.655
Get the hell out of here!

1:26:35.657 --> 1:26:36.556
Fuck you!

1:26:51.473 --> 1:26:53.573
You've reached Logan,
leave me your number,

1:26:53.575 --> 1:26:58.044
and I'll call you back.

1:27:04.019 --> 1:27:05.251
You've reached Logan.

1:27:05.253 --> 1:27:07.587
Leave me your number,
and I'll call you back.

1:27:07.589 --> 1:27:08.488
Shit.

1:27:33.749 --> 1:27:37.751
Come on, Ariane, pick
up the fucking phone.

1:29:28.063 --> 1:29:28.962
Hello?

1:29:34.669 --> 1:29:36.936
I need to ask you something.

1:29:43.011 --> 1:29:45.912
Am I really that
much of a burden?

1:29:49.251 --> 1:29:52.585
You have no idea
how special you are.

1:29:56.591 --> 1:29:58.424
From the right angle,

1:30:00.095 --> 1:30:02.562
Saint John's
Cathedral looks like

1:30:04.366 --> 1:30:07.934
an endless vortex
ready to suck you in.

1:30:14.242 --> 1:30:17.277
Hurting you was the last
thing I wanted to do.

1:30:22.684 --> 1:30:23.783
He was right.

1:30:28.023 --> 1:30:29.422
I fucked you up.

1:30:30.892 --> 1:30:32.025
You didn't.

1:31:06.561 --> 1:31:07.460
Ariane.

1:31:08.396 --> 1:31:09.295
Ariane!

1:31:10.966 --> 1:31:13.132
Hi, I need an ambulance
at Saint John's Bridge.

1:31:13.134 --> 1:31:15.702
I don't know, I just got here.

1:31:36.091 --> 1:31:37.190
Move, move!

1:32:50.165 --> 1:32:52.165
I'm so sorry.

1:32:52.167 --> 1:32:53.232
It's okay.

1:33:31.739 --> 1:33:33.673
His name's Alexander.

1:33:36.711 --> 1:33:38.778
He's 13 in this picture.

1:33:45.553 --> 1:33:47.153
The day after he was born,

1:33:49.090 --> 1:33:51.657
I overheard the last name
of the adoptive parents.

1:33:55.497 --> 1:33:57.497
And I hunted them down.

1:33:59.934 --> 1:34:00.833
And I found them.

1:34:02.270 --> 1:34:04.637
And I begged them to keep me
updated on how he was doing.

1:34:08.843 --> 1:34:10.543
He's really good at math.

1:34:13.748 --> 1:34:16.149
I was hoping that one
day you'd be ready.

1:34:21.489 --> 1:34:23.055
For years, they complied.

1:34:25.093 --> 1:34:27.059
Soon after his 13th birthday,

1:34:30.265 --> 1:34:31.864
they stopped all communication.

1:34:36.271 --> 1:34:39.672
You had been doing so well
in rebuilding your life,

1:34:39.674 --> 1:34:42.942
that I was worried
that if I told you,

1:34:42.944 --> 1:34:44.377
that maybe I would lose you.

1:34:46.147 --> 1:34:48.581
I just didn't know if
you'd be able to take it.

1:34:54.656 --> 1:34:56.689
It was years of lying.

1:34:58.293 --> 1:34:59.192
Years and years.

1:35:03.498 --> 1:35:04.397
That it became,

1:35:06.634 --> 1:35:11.137
it became so hard to
tell you the truth.

1:35:12.840 --> 1:35:14.774
Eventually, I realized
that no matter

1:35:16.744 --> 1:35:18.811
how this thing played out,

1:35:23.184 --> 1:35:26.586
you and I would never
be the same again.

1:35:31.359 --> 1:35:32.992
I love you so much.
