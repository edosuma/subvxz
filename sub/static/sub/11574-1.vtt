WEBVTT

00:06.048 --> 00:08.539
This is the part where | tell you
we're going to take down the Fae.

00:08.634 --> 00:10.499
I know you hate the
divide as much as I do

00:10.595 --> 00:12.586
--and we're going to put an end to that.
--Boom.

00:14.098 --> 00:15.463
[LAUREN] Come on, get him
in the lab! Move! Move!

00:15.558 --> 00:16.263
[BO] What the hell is going on?

00:16.309 --> 00:18.220
[LAUREN] There was an attack on
the meeting of the High Elders.

00:18.311 --> 00:20.427
The Ash is on life support
and it does not look good.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.022
We both know you can shape destiny.

00:22.106 --> 00:24.313
You've done it before,
so do it now for Bo.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.606
This is not a game.

00:25.693 --> 00:28.526
|wi|| take...

00:28.613 --> 00:31.400
...your love of her!

00:31.490 --> 00:34.448
You will never feel
passion for her again!

00:34.535 --> 00:37.117
[roaring]

00:43.336 --> 00:45.622
[BO] Here, little Underfae
monster-thingy.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.920
Remind me again why I agreed to
waste a perfectly good Friday night

00:48.007 --> 00:49.497
helping you track these bastards.

00:49.592 --> 00:52.254
Because having a bunch of
our less-evolved brethren

00:52.345 --> 00:54.381
running amok in the city is a bad thing.

00:54.472 --> 00:56.258
Not to mention, your mom
is the one who went all

00:56.349 --> 00:58.931
Vigilante Barbie and bombed
the Ash and the Elders.

00:59.018 --> 01:00.679
--So?
--So,

01:00.770 --> 01:02.806
It's your mom's fault
the Ash is on life support,

01:02.897 --> 01:06.185
the Elders are dead and all their
pets are running free and feral.

01:06.275 --> 01:11.360
And we're the Fae S.P.C.A. Yay!
You know whose job this really is?

01:11.447 --> 01:15.065
I told you--| haven't seen Dyson in,
like, three weeks, same as you.

01:15.159 --> 01:16.695
Once again, what happened
between you two?

01:16.786 --> 01:18.492
Well, nothing that would
make him go all AWOL like that.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.786
Find it yet?

01:20.873 --> 01:23.114
--Kenzi! Not cool!
--Ow!

01:23.209 --> 01:26.042
Well, you didn't see your
faces. It was way cool.

01:26.128 --> 01:27.709
Didn't we tell you to stay in the car?

01:27.797 --> 01:31.085
Cars are the basements
of horror movie clichÃ©s.

01:31.175 --> 01:33.086
Up there, up there!

01:37.515 --> 01:38.971
Coming your way again!

01:40.226 --> 01:42.842
[UNDERFAE screeching]

01:47.984 --> 01:50.817
Bye-bye, birdie.

01:50.903 --> 01:53.690
Is it weird that I'm
craving fried chicken?

01:53.781 --> 01:56.318
Damn. What was in those claws?

01:56.409 --> 01:58.741
Know what, it must be toxins.
Let me call Lauren.

01:58.828 --> 02:00.364
No, no, no. No time, I got this.

02:00.454 --> 02:01.705
--You sure?
--Yeah. You want to be helpful,

02:01.789 --> 02:05.156
call Dyson. Tell him to
grow a pair and come home.

02:05.251 --> 02:08.539
I'm tired of getting her
emergency takeout.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.085
Hang on.

02:13.968 --> 02:16.801
I really shouldn't leave
the counter unattended.

02:16.887 --> 02:21.631
Relax. My friend's got it covered and
you, you really deserve a coffee break.

02:24.645 --> 02:28.229
So, d-do you live
around here?

02:30.359 --> 02:35.069
|-| don't mean to
pressure you or anything,

02:35.156 --> 02:39.240
but if this is going too fast,
we could start with dinner.

02:39.327 --> 02:41.113
Works for me.

03:09.732 --> 03:12.439
Got your call. What's the trouble?

03:12.526 --> 03:14.482
Over here.

03:14.570 --> 03:17.858
You all some kind of circus
people or something?

03:19.950 --> 03:22.441
Some kind.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.697
[snarling]

03:27.208 --> 03:30.120
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

03:30.211 --> 03:33.123
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

03:33.214 --> 03:36.126
My love carries a death sentence.

03:36.217 --> 03:38.299
l was lost for years,

03:38.386 --> 03:41.048
searching, while hiding,

03:41.138 --> 03:45.302
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

03:45.393 --> 03:50.262
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

03:56.278 --> 03:59.406
The scar's barely visible. Even
given the balm we've been using,

03:59.490 --> 04:01.151
you're a remarkable healer.

04:01.242 --> 04:03.654
Great. Now I can get
back to writing my novel.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.530
Remember, still no heavy lifting.

04:05.621 --> 04:09.614
Lauren, these days, all I've
been doing is heavy lifting.

04:09.708 --> 04:12.541
Hey, our mighty hunters have returned.

04:12.628 --> 04:15.870
Done and done.

04:15.965 --> 04:17.671
Looked like a Piwichen, Trick.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.625
Whatever it was, it was
ugly and damn cranky.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.300
And totally reeking up my trunk.

04:22.388 --> 04:25.880
Hale said you were scratched.
Let me take a look.

04:25.975 --> 04:29.968
Residual bruising?
Why didn't you fully heal?

04:30.062 --> 04:33.680
Well, I thought it might be
nice to leave the kid alive.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.514
I'm fine.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.692
Besides, physician heal thyself.
When's the last time you even slept?

04:38.779 --> 04:41.862
I can't trust anybody to
monitor the Ash in his coma.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.281
It doesn't leave a lot
of time for siestas.

04:44.368 --> 04:47.952
--So, what are you doing here?
--I heard you needed me.

04:48.038 --> 04:50.165
I came.
[cell phone ringing]

04:52.793 --> 04:56.661
We swept the whole west quadrant
and tonight's catch makes eight.

04:56.755 --> 04:58.916
Underfae! Collect the whole set.

04:59.008 --> 05:01.215
Please tell me that's the last of them.

05:01.302 --> 05:04.260
It's not like I have an
official count, but I think so.

05:04.346 --> 05:06.758
You know, not for nothing, but
with the Ash out of commission,

05:06.849 --> 05:08.464
we Light Fae don't have a real leader.

05:08.559 --> 05:10.049
I mean, if he doesn't get better soon,

05:10.144 --> 05:12.851
bigger and more organized baddies
are going to start testing us.

05:12.938 --> 05:16.021
Seconded. Just got a
call from my assistant,

05:16.108 --> 05:18.565
there's been a body dump,
side of Highway Nine.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.153
The Cleaners have taken it to my lab.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.226
Are you sure it's a Fae kill?

05:21.322 --> 05:23.483
It's very likely. It's been flayed.

05:23.574 --> 05:24.484
What does that mean?

05:24.575 --> 05:26.031
It means something
ripped off all its skin.

05:26.118 --> 05:28.609
Oh, horf.

05:35.628 --> 05:37.164
You suck, Siren.

05:37.254 --> 05:39.336
Hey, now.

05:39.423 --> 05:42.790
I'm going to need you to come
with us. This could get science-y.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.174
I'm tired.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.975
That's definitely a body imprint
from where the corpse was left,

05:53.062 --> 05:54.677
but it's mostly just blood and fluids.

05:54.772 --> 05:59.482
I mean, there's some lymph
matter, interstitial tissue and,

05:59.568 --> 06:04.062
let's see, possibly some
digestive secretions. Neat.

06:04.156 --> 06:06.863
Wow, do we ever have a
different definition of that word.

06:06.951 --> 06:08.157
You think something swallowed it,

06:08.244 --> 06:10.986
spit the corpse out here,
but digested the skin?

06:11.080 --> 06:14.914
Possibly. I'd love to get a look at
that skin. It would tell me a lot.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.333
Either way, we'll know more when we
get back to the lab and I do a workup.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.285
Meanwhile, what kind
of Fae feed on skin?

06:20.381 --> 06:21.587
Well, we don't know it was Feeders.

06:21.674 --> 06:23.335
I mean, flayers come
in a number of types.

06:23.425 --> 06:26.667
There's collectors, there's sadists,
there's priests performing rituals.

06:26.762 --> 06:30.675
There's creepy dudes who like to make
body suits out of other people's skin.

06:30.766 --> 06:34.600
Who- or whatever did
this needs finding fast.

06:38.774 --> 06:40.981
A lot of different
tracks in this one area,

06:41.068 --> 06:42.808
like a bunch of them
pulled over at once.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.234
Got their wheels in the mud.

06:44.321 --> 06:45.401
Could be old.

06:45.489 --> 06:47.730
Uh uh. No, we had that big
rain yesterday afternoon.

06:47.825 --> 06:50.532
Anything earlier would
have been washed away.

06:50.619 --> 06:52.780
Whatever did this might
not be travelling alone.

06:52.871 --> 06:57.456
Great. We should talk to Trick, see if
he knows any trackers we can trust,

06:57.543 --> 07:00.285
since Mr. Dyson left us high and dry.

07:00.379 --> 07:04.543
He really picked a shitty
window for some me time, huh?

07:04.633 --> 07:07.750
She said, leaving an open
opportunity for her friend to snark.

07:07.845 --> 07:11.087
Oh, I am all out of snark.

07:11.181 --> 07:15.265
What if he's not coming back?
What if he is hurt?

07:15.352 --> 07:17.013
He wouldn't leave us for good
without saying good-bye.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.971
--How do you know?
--Because I know Dyson.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.147
And he just isn't that massive a dick.

07:22.234 --> 07:25.522
And, come on, how much can
a dude change in three weeks?

07:35.873 --> 07:38.740
Six semi-conscious
rednecks and 5K in damages

07:38.834 --> 07:42.292
to a perfectly
unrespectable road house.

07:43.505 --> 07:47.214
And the first I hear of you in weeks
is a call from your arresting officer.

07:47.301 --> 07:50.964
What do you got to say
for yourself, Detective?

07:51.055 --> 07:52.841
They started it.

07:57.728 --> 07:59.309
My man.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.439
Thank you, Officers.

08:04.526 --> 08:09.941
Next time I'm in,
wherever it is you're from,

08:10.032 --> 08:11.647
dinner's on me.

08:15.704 --> 08:20.243
And by "me," I mean you.

08:22.336 --> 08:23.792
Good to see you, brother.

08:23.879 --> 08:27.337
Hey, my throat's bleeding from
all the singing I had to do, man.

08:27.424 --> 08:30.416
I didn't ask you to.

08:30.511 --> 08:32.627
l was handling it.

08:32.721 --> 08:36.179
And by "handling," ladies and
gentlemen, I'm pretty sure he means

08:36.266 --> 08:38.928
handling himself into rages
up and down the coast.

08:39.019 --> 08:43.388
At least that's what I heard.
Anyway, first, welcome back.

08:43.482 --> 08:44.813
Second, what's eating you?

08:44.900 --> 08:49.860
Uh, scratch that, don't care,

08:49.947 --> 08:52.108
--'cause we got bigger issues.
--Like what?

08:52.199 --> 08:55.282
Shit is getting real. Half the Elders
are dead, thanks to Aife's bomb.

08:55.369 --> 08:57.234
The Ash is hanging by a thread.

08:57.329 --> 08:58.284
Who's in charge?

08:58.372 --> 09:01.535
Temporarily, Elder Porter is acting Ash.

09:01.625 --> 09:04.367
Buzz Porter? "Never met an
ale I didn't like" Porter?

09:04.461 --> 09:06.873
Look, Trick is doing his best to
control things behind the scenes,

09:06.964 --> 09:09.046
but it's not enough, man.

09:09.133 --> 09:10.213
Look, the Light is weak

09:10.300 --> 09:12.552
and all the hungry nasties are
coming out of the woodwork,

09:12.636 --> 09:16.424
trying to test the waters.
We need you back.

09:16.515 --> 09:21.885
Also, your girl, about to put out a
Missing Person's A.P.B. on that ass.

09:21.979 --> 09:24.220
--How is Bo?
--She about to be a whole lot better

09:24.314 --> 09:25.850
once she sees your furry face.

09:25.941 --> 09:30.150
Finally, things can start
getting back to normal. Come on.

10:08.192 --> 10:10.023
You know what to do with it.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.505
No. No, I lost it again.

10:30.589 --> 10:32.705
Great. A bloodhound with allergies.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.916
Trick really outdid
himself with the referral.

10:35.010 --> 10:38.343
It's a sinus thing and we discussed
this. Get off my back, food!

10:38.430 --> 10:40.887
Seriously, you're both
giving me a headache.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.966
It must be the pollen count. No, wait!

10:45.437 --> 10:49.931
There! I told you I'd
do it. Now pony up.

10:50.025 --> 10:52.516
All right. Hold on.

10:55.948 --> 10:59.156
Pharmaceutical-grade allergy
meds from my doctor friend.

10:59.243 --> 11:01.655
--Enjoy.
--A|right.

11:01.745 --> 11:03.576
By the way, my nose is
still plenty good enough

11:03.664 --> 11:06.280
to tell they're friends of the family.

11:06.375 --> 11:09.082
Other Fae.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.579
Yeah, we know one of them is Fae.

11:10.671 --> 11:14.289
Not one. All of them.

11:26.186 --> 11:30.304
You'll have to excuse us, we're
not set up for visitors just yet.

11:30.399 --> 11:31.479
New to town?

11:31.567 --> 11:34.400
And every town.
Always just passing through.

11:34.486 --> 11:38.445
I present myself, Zael, and
my travelling sideshow.

11:38.532 --> 11:41.569
Do you hunger for wonder?
Do you thirst for thrills?

11:41.660 --> 11:44.276
I bring greetings from the Ash.

11:45.914 --> 11:47.450
A sister.

11:47.541 --> 11:50.908
Well, that's a relief. I wasn't in the
mood for the whole song and dance.

11:51.003 --> 11:53.039
Guh-jood juh-kweed.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.543
Where are my manners?

11:57.634 --> 12:00.250
Can we offer you something
to drink, some food?

12:00.345 --> 12:06.306
An explanation. We tracked you
from a body left on a roadside.

12:06.393 --> 12:10.352
Oh, that. Well, trust me, I'm mortified.

12:12.774 --> 12:16.312
One of our less civilized members
occasionally slips out for a feed.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.064
But we have reclaimed him

12:18.155 --> 12:21.022
and he will not trouble you
again. You have my word.

12:21.116 --> 12:24.153
Oh, that totally makes
up for killing a guy.

12:35.839 --> 12:37.955
Well, it was the circus
back in the 1800s.

12:38.050 --> 12:40.792
Then sideshow freaks, vaudevillians.

12:40.886 --> 12:44.595
Nowadays, we're more
industrial performance artists.

12:44.681 --> 12:49.175
It's a great way for our kind to pass
out in the open. Do you want to join?

12:49.269 --> 12:51.510
We always have room
for a beautiful woman.

12:51.605 --> 12:55.018
Thank you, but I'm good.

12:55.108 --> 12:58.521
We'll just file a report with the
Ash and let you off with a warning,

12:58.612 --> 13:01.149
since you're just passing through.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.155
Come on.

13:04.242 --> 13:07.609
Well, if your feet ever
start itching, come find us.

13:08.872 --> 13:10.908
Are we just going to let
him get away with murder?

13:10.999 --> 13:12.955
We're outnumbered. I don't want
to start a small war out here,

13:14.503 --> 13:15.618
So, what now?

13:15.712 --> 13:18.089
We get Trick's say-so.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.175
Can we go?

13:28.308 --> 13:30.685
Hello, my dear, dear friends.

13:34.272 --> 13:36.183
Oh.

13:36.274 --> 13:42.270
Buzz, what are you doing,
other than washing in mead?

13:42.364 --> 13:46.152
Oh, just checking out the
proletariat, kissing a few babies.

13:46.243 --> 13:48.780
Good for the people to
know I'm here for them.

13:48.870 --> 13:52.112
Your job is to calm the
people by reminding them

13:52.207 --> 13:54.289
that the Ash will be well any day now.

13:54.376 --> 13:57.368
And, in the meantime,
you're just doing his bidding.

13:57.462 --> 14:01.671
Oh, that, too. That, too.

14:06.138 --> 14:09.050
I think there's actually steam
coming out of those ears.

14:09.141 --> 14:11.132
[phone ringing]

14:11.226 --> 14:14.184
Trick. What is it, Hale?

14:15.814 --> 14:17.770
What? What is it?

14:17.858 --> 14:19.223
lt's Dyson.

14:19.317 --> 14:20.523
Is he hurt?

14:20.610 --> 14:22.191
He's home.

14:31.788 --> 14:34.245
I said I'm ready to pay
your price, crone.

14:34.332 --> 14:37.415
If you give my strength to Bo,
you can take anything you need.

14:37.502 --> 14:41.086
A deal is struck. A sacrifice
is named and accepted.

14:41.173 --> 14:46.588
In exchange, I will take from you
that which you value the most.

14:46.678 --> 14:49.385
I will take...

14:49.473 --> 14:52.965
...your love of her!

14:53.060 --> 14:54.891
You will remember
the one you have lost,

14:54.978 --> 14:57.685
but you will never feel
passion for her again.

14:57.773 --> 14:59.638
[roaring]

15:05.489 --> 15:07.070
Hey.

15:20.378 --> 15:25.589
Seriously? You disappear for
three weeks and no phone call?

15:25.675 --> 15:27.211
Do you know how scared I was?

15:27.302 --> 15:29.793
What, are there no
phones in Douchetown?

15:29.888 --> 15:31.469
See you been working
on your right hook.

15:31.556 --> 15:33.057
Dyson .

15:35.894 --> 15:38.135
l was dealing with some personal stuff.

15:38.230 --> 15:40.391
What, we're not personal?

15:43.777 --> 15:49.192
Hale said there was a body.
l was just on my way to the Dal.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.443
Want to join me?

15:54.454 --> 15:59.574
I did a forensics workup. The killer
is definitely Fae. So is the victim.

15:59.668 --> 16:03.661
--Our side?
--|'m still |.D.ing the remains.

16:03.755 --> 16:05.370
Well, we might be
able to help with that.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.330
Kenzi and l tracked the kill
to a group of circus Fae

16:07.425 --> 16:10.462
camping out by the old candy factory.
We can push them harder to talk.

16:10.554 --> 16:12.260
I'm guessing it'll take
more than a push.

16:12.347 --> 16:16.556
Zael never told us the kill was Fae, so
they are definitely hiding something.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.055
Come on, I'll take you there.

16:20.814 --> 16:24.602
I'm going to take this with Hale.
I've got some catching up to do.

16:24.693 --> 16:28.231
Actually, I have to get back
to the lab, too. Excuse me.

16:30.198 --> 16:31.813
Did he just give me the brush-off?

16:31.908 --> 16:34.650
Give him some time. Besides,
I could use your help here.

16:34.744 --> 16:37.486
Come, tell me about this circus.

16:50.552 --> 16:54.545
For starters, where
the hell they all go?

16:56.349 --> 16:58.965
And why leave their wheels?

17:01.188 --> 17:03.895
'Cause a convoy's a lot easier to track.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.603
[HALE] And their clothes.

17:12.699 --> 17:16.783
Can you get your wolf on?

17:27.839 --> 17:30.706
They got wise, salted their path.

17:32.677 --> 17:34.793
But I do smell something.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.004
What is it?

17:50.946 --> 17:53.312
What is that?

17:53.406 --> 17:57.775
It's definitely skin. And it
belongs to our Fae corpse.

17:57.869 --> 18:03.205
Whoa. Well, that's interesting,
the skin has a tattoo on it.

18:03.291 --> 18:04.451
[DYSON] The one on his hand?

18:04.542 --> 18:07.284
No, this one was done
on the inside of his skin

18:07.379 --> 18:10.837
years ago and while the
deceased was still wearing it.

18:10.924 --> 18:12.084
How is that possible?

18:12.175 --> 18:16.965
I've never seen it or heard of it. It
must be some sort of mystical process.

18:17.055 --> 18:18.340
[HALE] Damn, looks like a map.

18:18.431 --> 18:21.173
[DYSON] Well, at least now we've
got a motive for skinning someone.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.725
Any idea of what it's a map of?

18:25.105 --> 18:27.687
I'll see what I can do.

18:27.774 --> 18:28.479
[BO] Hello.

18:28.525 --> 18:30.390
Hey. ls Trick there?

18:30.485 --> 18:33.568
Hang on. Let me put you on speaker.

18:33.655 --> 18:34.440
Any luck?

18:34.489 --> 18:35.399
[DYSON] Well, they were gone,

18:35.490 --> 18:36.991
but we did find some of the skin.

18:37.075 --> 18:40.238
Strange thing is it's got a map
tattooed on the inside of it.

18:40.328 --> 18:41.363
All pre-mortem.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.490
--You sure about that?
--Lauren seems to be.

18:43.581 --> 18:45.287
Look, I'm going to check our case
files and see if there's anything

18:45.375 --> 18:49.584
I can dig up in the tattoo
database. I'll let you know.

18:49.671 --> 18:52.253
That thing about the tattoo,
there's a few things that could be.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.080
Hey, where are you going, big boss?

18:54.175 --> 18:57.667
l liberated some of the Ash's rarer
books from his storeroom recently.

18:57.762 --> 19:00.720
Why, sir, I am--l'm just appalled.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.138
For safe keeping.

19:02.225 --> 19:03.385
[KENZI] Uh huh.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.967
I think they might have
the answers we need.

19:06.062 --> 19:07.802
Take your time.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.063
Oh, god, I miss the old days

19:11.151 --> 19:13.688
when chasing your mama
was our biggest headache.

19:13.778 --> 19:17.441
Actually, what am I doing?
You are the bartender.

19:17.532 --> 19:19.568
Right.

19:19.659 --> 19:22.742
Another glass, another glass.
What are you drinking?

19:22.829 --> 19:26.868
Um... I don't know.
Maybe something sweet.

19:26.958 --> 19:30.371
Like an apology from Dyson for being
La Merde-face since he got back.

19:30.462 --> 19:33.374
Thank you. He's being
a total ass, right?

19:33.465 --> 19:35.751
Guy disappears for three
weeks and leaves you hanging,

19:35.842 --> 19:38.128
usually the girl gets to
be the pissy one, yes?

19:38.219 --> 19:39.925
That is how I have come
to understand things,

19:40.013 --> 19:42.925
from my education in
romantic comedies, yes.

19:43.016 --> 19:48.181
Also, girls with glasses are way
smart and being klutzy is adorable.

19:48.271 --> 19:50.808
It's like he's afraid
to be alone with me.

19:50.899 --> 19:53.561
Maybe you're not going
to like what he has to say.

20:06.498 --> 20:07.954
[screaming]

20:09.459 --> 20:11.575
--Are you okay?
--|'m fine. Go.

20:13.171 --> 20:14.035
[BO] Got ya!

20:14.130 --> 20:15.586
Rats.

20:17.050 --> 20:19.166
He turned into rats.

20:19.969 --> 20:22.836
Please tell me you know
what the hell is going on.

20:28.686 --> 20:30.301
That's the rat dude that attacked you?

20:30.397 --> 20:32.558
Tesso, or rather one of his descendants.

20:32.649 --> 20:34.731
Rare Japanese Fae.
Powerful shamans.

20:34.818 --> 20:37.184
They absorb knowledge
by, well, eating it.

20:39.948 --> 20:41.609
we'll know what he was
trying to learn, right?

20:41.699 --> 20:43.610
I'm already trying to piece
that together from the remains.

20:43.701 --> 20:46.363
Meanwhile, this tells a tale all its own.

20:46.454 --> 20:49.036
I saw more of those at the
circus camp. What do they mean?

20:49.124 --> 20:50.785
What do any of you
know about the Sluagh?

20:50.875 --> 20:54.038
The Wandering Damned.
Thought they were just superstition.

20:54.129 --> 20:57.166
No. They're real. And they're not
damned or dead, they're cursed.

20:57.257 --> 20:59.794
Forced to wander the Earth
without rest, without a home.

20:59.884 --> 21:01.260
Who'd they piss off?

21:01.344 --> 21:05.007
Let's just say in the early Fae
wars between Light and Dark,

21:05.098 --> 21:07.464
they tried to play both
sides and fooled neither.

21:07.559 --> 21:10.551
Well, I like them already.
But why are they here now?

21:10.645 --> 21:13.352
Many of them became thieves.
So, if there's a band of them here--

21:13.440 --> 21:15.271
They're probably here
to steal something.

21:15.358 --> 21:17.519
Something to which
that map tattoo points.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.692
And, apparently,
something worth killing for.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.155
I'll check with the local Fae-fences,

21:21.239 --> 21:24.857
see if there's something
unusually valuable in town.

21:29.956 --> 21:33.289
I took another look at the skin
that Dyson found. I got an ID.

21:33.376 --> 21:36.493
Sit. Eat. Defer your imminent coma.

21:36.588 --> 21:40.456
No, really, I'm fine.
I'm just a little bit tired.

21:45.388 --> 21:47.128
Why are carbs so damn tasty?

21:47.223 --> 21:50.215
Actually, I know why.
It's an interesting fact.

21:50.310 --> 21:53.473
They increase the body's insulin,
which clears competing amino acid

21:53.563 --> 21:55.599
and a path of serotonin to the brain--

21:55.690 --> 21:56.645
Lauren.

21:56.733 --> 21:59.440
Right. Less geeking, more eating.

21:59.527 --> 22:02.314
Marvin Arcdael.
That's our flaying victim?

22:02.405 --> 22:04.441
Uh huh. Light Fae and tow truck driver.

22:04.532 --> 22:07.365
Which makes sense because
he's a Doonie, a helpful road Fae.

22:07.452 --> 22:10.489
My guess is the Sluagh faked a roadside
emergency and called him there.

22:10.580 --> 22:12.411
Have you found out anything
more about this map tattoo?

22:12.499 --> 22:14.911
The sample was too
degraded in the fire.

22:15.001 --> 22:19.040
But he did have one external symbol
on his hand, which might be of use.

22:19.130 --> 22:21.246
But the bigger news is this--

22:21.341 --> 22:25.209
when | used the Ash's access
clearance code to look into Marvin,

22:25.303 --> 22:29.672
these two were linked to him. They
have the same symbol on their hand.

22:29.766 --> 22:30.926
[BO] Why?

22:31.017 --> 22:33.850
[LAUREN] It doesn't say.
I didn't get that far.

22:33.937 --> 22:36.895
I brought books so we
could look at it further.

22:36.981 --> 22:42.772
Maybe I could just close my eyes
for, like, maybe just one second.

22:50.954 --> 22:53.821
I knew it! Step away from the scalpel.

22:53.915 --> 22:56.622
Kenzi, give me the rat.

22:56.709 --> 23:01.999
One step closer and I'm seriously
calling PETA... or, I guess, FETA.

23:02.090 --> 23:04.331
Hey, do the Fae even have some
sort of protection society?

23:04.425 --> 23:08.714
Kenzi, it's just sleeping.
These are just tweezers.

23:08.805 --> 23:11.137
I'm not going to hurt it, I promise.

23:15.353 --> 23:17.639
--Careful.
--I will.

23:21.693 --> 23:23.433
Open wide.

23:28.241 --> 23:29.777
What is it?

23:33.079 --> 23:34.785
[TRICK] Trouble.

23:35.790 --> 23:38.873
[mumbling]

23:51.264 --> 23:53.300
[KENZI] Super-sized shit.

23:55.977 --> 23:58.468
She's just taking a
nap, relax. What's up?

23:58.563 --> 24:00.349
We may have figured out
what the Sluagh want,

24:00.440 --> 24:04.308
or at least what they're after next,
it's called the Sword of Agros.

24:04.402 --> 24:05.938
Trick doesn't know where to
find it yet, but he says that--

24:06.029 --> 24:09.271
I do. At least I have a good
idea who's protecting it.

24:09.365 --> 24:11.981
--How?
--I 'm super smart.

24:12.076 --> 24:15.989
Okay, these three are what
the Fae call Guardians.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.116
It's a sort of life of servitude,

24:18.207 --> 24:21.495
donating your actual body for
the protection of something.

24:21.586 --> 24:24.953
That kind of something
the Sluagh might want?

24:25.048 --> 24:29.382
This Guardian, he's dead. And these
two, they have no contact info.

24:29.469 --> 24:31.380
[cell phone ringing]

24:31.471 --> 24:32.460
Dyson?

24:32.555 --> 24:34.796
[DYSON] We found another body,
dumpster in the East End.

24:34.891 --> 24:37.428
Male. Something was
ripped out of him.

24:37.518 --> 24:39.679
His name wouldn't happen
to be Ralph, would it?

24:42.774 --> 24:44.810
Extraordinary. Looks like some sort of

24:44.901 --> 24:47.768
organic flexible tube implanted
right along the spinal column.

24:47.862 --> 24:50.478
It's not a tube, it's a sheath.

24:50.573 --> 24:53.315
[DYSON] This guy was
carrying a sword inside of him.

24:53.409 --> 24:55.365
So, he's a living sheath?

24:55.453 --> 24:56.989
The Sword of Agros.

24:57.080 --> 24:59.162
And something tells me whoever
pulled that sword out of him

24:59.248 --> 25:02.206
is not going to use it to trim hedges.

25:07.548 --> 25:09.834
[BO] Do we even know why
the Sluagh wanted that sword?

25:09.926 --> 25:13.134
'Cause they need it to help
them steal something greater.

25:13.221 --> 25:15.132
--What?
--Our land.

25:15.223 --> 25:16.963
What? How is that possible?

25:17.058 --> 25:20.550
In order for a district to be
claimed by the Light Fae,

25:20.645 --> 25:23.432
each Ash has to make a
covenant with the land

25:23.523 --> 25:28.142
in a secret mystic ceremony.
The bohsee ahn talahv.

25:28.236 --> 25:29.146
Translation?

25:29.237 --> 25:31.444
"He marries the land."

25:31.531 --> 25:35.274
The Ash swears to protect the
good of the land and in return,

25:35.368 --> 25:37.029
the land is good to his people.

25:37.120 --> 25:39.532
It used to mean better
crops and less disease.

25:39.622 --> 25:42.284
Now it's longer-lasting infrastructure,

25:42.375 --> 25:43.990
more wealth, less crime.

25:44.085 --> 25:47.168
But only if the marriage
ceremony's consummated.

25:47.255 --> 25:48.870
Define "consummated."

25:48.965 --> 25:53.709
Well, without getting into the grander,
more mind-bending metaphysics of it,

25:53.803 --> 25:58.137
the soul of the land takes on corporeal
form with which the Ash will mate.

25:58.224 --> 26:00.556
Talk about laying some turf.

26:00.643 --> 26:02.679
Pounding some ground.

26:02.770 --> 26:03.885
Are you done?

26:03.980 --> 26:04.935
Sorry.

26:05.022 --> 26:08.310
With the Ash on the verge of death,
he's already losing his bond.

26:08.401 --> 26:10.733
lt's exactly the opportunity
the Sluagh were looking for

26:10.820 --> 26:14.312
by binding themselves to the earth
and claiming it for their own.

26:14.407 --> 26:17.820
Well, is that really so bad? I mean,
isn't there enough room for everyone?

26:17.910 --> 26:19.650
If they steal our
covenant with the land,

26:19.746 --> 26:23.034
all the Light Fae that currently live
here would be forced into exile.

26:23.124 --> 26:26.491
And the Dark would be
free to overrun the city.

26:26.586 --> 26:28.577
Not good news for the
humans that remain.

26:28.671 --> 26:32.038
Yeah. Those are both bad.
So, what can we do?

26:32.133 --> 26:35.125
The Sluagh will need to fully
sever the Ash's land bond

26:35.219 --> 26:36.925
before they can forge their own.

26:37.013 --> 26:40.255
They're looking for this,

26:40.349 --> 26:44.592
the physical manifestation
of the bond, the heart stone.

26:44.687 --> 26:49.272
Breaking this with the Sword of Agros
will completely sever the bond.

26:49.358 --> 26:50.438
Well, where is it?

26:50.526 --> 26:53.768
Well, I'm guessing that's what Marvin's
skin map would have led them to.

26:53.863 --> 26:56.855
Too bad it's too damaged
to be of much use to us.

26:56.949 --> 27:00.487
Hello. You're our Trickopedia.

27:00.578 --> 27:02.318
No. l was never local government.

27:02.413 --> 27:05.496
I'll have to summon Buzz,
as much as it pains me.

27:05.583 --> 27:11.624
But as acting Ash, there are some
things only he's privy to. Sit tight.

27:15.843 --> 27:24.683
So, while we wait,
anyone want to get some air?

27:24.769 --> 27:26.350
I'm good, thanks.

27:26.437 --> 27:29.895
Great. That's jim-dandy.

27:33.694 --> 27:38.484
Dude, what's been up with you lately?
That time of the wolf-month?

27:38.574 --> 27:40.485
Missed you too, Kenzi.

27:43.371 --> 27:48.286
She's got a point. You seem a little
off your game since you came back.

27:48.376 --> 27:50.367
Something I should know?

27:50.461 --> 27:51.997
Not really.

27:58.553 --> 28:02.296
Okay. Do you know the
old story of King Leopold,

28:02.390 --> 28:05.006
the tribute he made as a
sacrifice to the Norns?

28:05.101 --> 28:06.307
Yeah.

28:06.394 --> 28:10.478
Well, | asked a Norn for help
when Bo went to face her mother.

28:10.565 --> 28:12.021
So?

28:13.734 --> 28:17.022
Aw, man!

28:17.113 --> 28:22.028
All right, bold move, but you just
run off after? What's up with that?

28:22.118 --> 28:25.952
l was in shock, okay,
denial. Whatever you want.

28:27.707 --> 28:30.494
Wounded animals like to
lick their wounds in private.

28:30.585 --> 28:33.952
No wonder things are tense
between you two. How did Bo take it?

28:34.046 --> 28:36.002
I haven't told her yet.

28:36.090 --> 28:38.797
Why are you shutting her down
and trying to avoid her, fool?

28:38.885 --> 28:42.218
Shouldn't you be, you know,
trying to get up close and personal?

28:42.305 --> 28:43.215
Why?

28:43.306 --> 28:48.846
To be sure. Otherwise, how do
you know the curse really took?

28:48.936 --> 28:51.848
There's a reason our Fae
tales end with a magic kiss.

28:51.939 --> 28:54.806
And your girl's lips are supercharged.

28:54.901 --> 28:58.234
What the Norn took from you,
maybe Bo can get it back.

29:12.543 --> 29:14.499
lever tell you about the
time the third Ash and |

29:14.587 --> 29:16.669
went across the border incognito?

29:16.756 --> 29:20.089
Oh, there were some shenanigans
that day, I promise you.

29:20.176 --> 29:23.339
Buzz! Try to think.
We need to know where it is.

29:23.429 --> 29:24.794
[BUZZ] Where what is?

29:24.889 --> 29:26.345
The heart stone.

29:26.432 --> 29:27.672
Well, what about it?

29:27.767 --> 29:31.100
There has to be another way,
or someone else who knows.

29:31.187 --> 29:33.143
I mean, how many old
rocks representing

29:33.230 --> 29:35.061
the Ash's link to the land can there be?

29:35.149 --> 29:37.140
You mean the heart stone.

29:37.234 --> 29:40.818
Well, why didn't you just damn
well ask, for goodness sakes?

29:40.905 --> 29:45.524
Hey, you there, meat bag, give me
my glasses and a pen, will you?

29:45.618 --> 29:47.984
I'll write you a map.

29:55.044 --> 29:57.911
--Meat bag?
--|'m sorry.

30:01.092 --> 30:04.801
Look, once we get that map, I think
Hale and I can handle the stone.

30:04.887 --> 30:05.842
Maybe you and--

30:05.930 --> 30:09.013
Stop avoiding me!

30:09.100 --> 30:11.716
--|'m not.
--You know what we do best?

30:11.811 --> 30:15.895
We fight... each other,
the world, whatever.

30:15.982 --> 30:19.145
As a team, we're pretty unbeatable.
And that is what is needed right now.

30:19.235 --> 30:23.069
You and I being Team Badass.
We'll deal with our personal shit after.

30:23.155 --> 30:25.692
But right now, you're going
to put on your big-wolf pants

30:25.783 --> 30:27.489
and you're going to come
with me and kick some tail

30:27.576 --> 30:32.616
or I'm going to start
kicking your tail. Agreed?

30:32.707 --> 30:34.572
Yes, ma'am.

30:34.667 --> 30:36.453
Thank you.

30:41.007 --> 30:43.965
So, what do we do with this
heart stone once we find it?

30:44.051 --> 30:46.258
Should we have hired a crane?

30:46.345 --> 30:51.055
Shh. The Sluagh have the map.
They might be here already.

30:52.309 --> 30:56.769
Well, this should be it. I'm not
seeing anything heart stone-ish.

30:58.357 --> 30:59.972
What about in here?

31:04.071 --> 31:05.527
Bo!

31:22.840 --> 31:24.080
It was them.

31:24.175 --> 31:27.588
Oh, great. Lovely.

31:27.678 --> 31:30.761
This isn't the place, but
they knew we were coming.

31:30.848 --> 31:32.213
Just like they knew
where to find Marvin

31:32.308 --> 31:35.596
and that the Ash's books
were in Trick's lair.

31:35.686 --> 31:39.395
They've always been two steps ahead.

31:39.482 --> 31:41.438
How is that?

31:45.780 --> 31:48.647
Well, that's a fine how do you do.

31:48.741 --> 31:50.697
Talk sense or suffer.

31:50.785 --> 31:54.698
You threaten your acting Ash?
I should call the High Council.

31:54.789 --> 31:57.280
Let me get you the phone
and I'll beat you with it.

31:57.374 --> 31:59.410
And after that, you can
explain to the High Council

31:59.502 --> 32:04.713
why you committed treason. I don't
think you'll find much mercy there.

32:04.799 --> 32:07.381
I saw an opportunity and I took it.

32:07.468 --> 32:10.380
We both know my best years are
behind me with the Light Fae.

32:10.471 --> 32:16.842
But the Sluagh, they promised me
the wealth and power I deserve.

32:16.936 --> 32:18.472
How do we stop this?

32:18.562 --> 32:24.478
You're too late. Can't
you feel it, the land?

32:24.568 --> 32:26.433
She's awakening.

32:43.879 --> 32:45.619
Hello, lover.

32:45.714 --> 32:48.000
You're not the Ash.

32:54.807 --> 32:57.549
So, what was Tesso looking
for in those books he ate?

32:57.643 --> 32:59.224
An incantation.

32:59.311 --> 33:04.772
In order for their leader, Zael, to get
enough juice for the fastening ritual.

33:04.859 --> 33:07.817
Yeah, yeah. The magical
boinking. We know. Go on.

33:07.903 --> 33:12.317
Well, Tesso will need to perform
the chant, so doing will funnel

33:12.408 --> 33:15.320
all the sexual energy from a
large group of revellers to Zael.

33:15.411 --> 33:18.699
What, crowd-sourced Viagra?
We do that?

33:18.789 --> 33:20.871
There's a reason why
Fae and pagan rituals

33:20.958 --> 33:23.791
are often performed
alongside of group revelry.

33:23.878 --> 33:29.168
All that sex and joy essence
is a powerful energy source.

33:29.258 --> 33:32.170
Playboy grotto must be, like, bam!

33:32.261 --> 33:33.671
So, where does this leave us?

33:33.762 --> 33:37.050
The easiest vessels for Fae to
draw from are always humans.

33:37.141 --> 33:39.382
Zael and his people are going
to need some sort of an event

33:39.476 --> 33:41.603
or something that gathers
some humans together.

33:41.687 --> 33:42.551
And all spur of the moment,

33:42.646 --> 33:45.479
since they only just found the
sword and the heart stone.

33:45.566 --> 33:47.602
Guys, are we looking for some kind of

33:47.693 --> 33:51.026
sexy, pagan underground
flash rave tonight?

33:51.113 --> 33:52.569
Seriously, I got this covered.

33:52.656 --> 33:55.693
Just give the human,
like, five minutes, tops.

33:55.784 --> 34:02.371
So, anyone looking for a sexy,
sexy, neopagan ritual dance party?

34:29.151 --> 34:30.687
You okay?

34:30.778 --> 34:33.611
You look a little nipple-y.

34:33.697 --> 34:37.360
Just hungry. This place is dripping sex.

34:37.451 --> 34:40.693
That Tesso is channelling
some strong hoodoo.

34:40.788 --> 34:42.779
Oh, even I can feel it.

34:42.873 --> 34:44.704
I think we need to split up.

34:44.792 --> 34:47.625
Me and D can try and muzzle
Tesso, stop the incantations.

34:47.711 --> 34:50.498
Okay. Bo and I will...

34:50.589 --> 34:52.295
Bo?

34:56.804 --> 35:00.547
Can you make it through on your own,
or do l have to cuff your muff?

35:00.641 --> 35:02.757
I think I'll manage.

36:00.743 --> 36:04.486
Go. Good luck.

36:28.020 --> 36:32.389
So, do you have to be this
horny to ride this ride?

36:34.568 --> 36:39.528
[chanting]

36:41.825 --> 36:45.818
Okay. I'll sing him into
submission and then we'll just...

36:53.087 --> 36:55.703
...or we can do that.

36:55.798 --> 36:59.006
Oops! Lost your mojo.

37:02.179 --> 37:05.387
It's no worry. I have
enough virility by now.

37:05.474 --> 37:08.432
That's what they all say. Go!

37:14.441 --> 37:18.434
Buzz told me about you.
You must realize,

37:18.529 --> 37:21.896
you have more in common with
us than those others out there.

37:21.990 --> 37:23.946
Must I?

37:24.034 --> 37:28.277
We're all outcasts, just like you.

37:28.372 --> 37:34.709
Well, don't sell yourself short. You're
also ritual murderers and thieves.

37:34.795 --> 37:38.754
I'm just doing what's
necessary for my people.

37:38.841 --> 37:41.708
We've been wandering for centuries.

37:41.802 --> 37:43.667
We just want to stop.

37:43.762 --> 37:47.630
Buddy, I understand, believe me.

37:52.646 --> 37:56.264
I've been there. I know exactly
what it is like to be an outcast.

37:56.358 --> 38:01.273
To have no home, but this one,
this one is spoken for.

38:10.038 --> 38:12.780
This one is mine.

38:17.754 --> 38:21.793
To Zael and the Sluagh being
run out of yet another town.

38:21.884 --> 38:23.499
To the bohsee ahn talahv.

38:23.594 --> 38:27.928
May our bond with the land be
restored, before someone else covets it.

38:32.519 --> 38:35.386
Well, that all ended
better than I feared.

38:35.481 --> 38:37.642
You thought the Sluagh
were going to win?

38:37.733 --> 38:40.975
I thought the Sluagh
were my punishment.

38:41.069 --> 38:47.486
The night you left, | used my blood
to try and keep Aife from harming Bo.

38:47.576 --> 38:50.113
--And?
--Seemed to work,

38:50.204 --> 38:53.321
but there's always a cost
when I use my gift.

38:59.004 --> 39:01.461
Well, maybe this time, it'll be different.

39:01.548 --> 39:04.335
It's good to have you home.

39:04.426 --> 39:07.418
l was beginning to worry
we'd lost you out there.

39:14.394 --> 39:16.100
Thanks for the drink.

39:42.422 --> 39:47.337
So, are we going to
start this reunion over?

39:47.427 --> 39:51.170
Depends. You going
to punch me again?

39:51.265 --> 39:54.849
I am tempted.

39:54.935 --> 39:57.927
You going to tell me where
you've been all this time?

39:58.021 --> 40:02.310
Barely remember. It's not important.

40:02.401 --> 40:06.895
It's important to me.

40:06.989 --> 40:09.446
What were you running from?

40:13.996 --> 40:18.035
Okay, I'll start.

40:18.125 --> 40:23.620
Before you left, | asked you not
to interfere in my fight with Aife.

40:23.714 --> 40:28.629
But that night, I swear
I could feel you with me.

40:28.719 --> 40:31.506
And it made all the difference.

40:37.853 --> 40:40.139
Thank you.

40:40.230 --> 40:45.099
| asked a Norn to give you my
strength against your mother.

40:46.903 --> 40:50.771
But you should know,
it came at a price.

40:50.866 --> 40:55.610
Well, tell me, whatever
it is, we can handle it.

40:55.704 --> 41:01.449
Norn's take in payment
what you value most.

41:01.543 --> 41:06.458
I didn't know what it was at the time.
I offered her my wolf.

41:06.548 --> 41:09.540
Dyson .

41:09.635 --> 41:12.001
That's not what she took.

41:13.639 --> 41:17.757
Well, what did she take?

41:23.523 --> 41:27.186
Us.

41:27.277 --> 41:33.489
You're not even making any sense.
How can--how can someone take "us"?

41:36.244 --> 41:42.160
By making it impossible for me
to feel anything for you, ever.

41:45.337 --> 41:50.627
Well, that's ridiculous. And anyway,
at the rave tonight, that kiss, it was--

41:50.717 --> 41:53.629
Our last.

41:53.720 --> 42:00.592
I'm sorry, Bo. It's not howl
wanted it, but I had to know.

42:00.686 --> 42:04.178
Now I do.

42:04.272 --> 42:05.853
I'm sorry.

42:26.169 --> 42:27.875
Are you lost, sweetie?

42:27.963 --> 42:31.126
Because I am really not in the mood
to go chasing after Zael and his crew.

42:31.216 --> 42:34.049
I'm not one of the Sluagh.

42:34.136 --> 42:38.129
What are you, just some
glandularly-challenged circus groupie?

42:40.142 --> 42:42.508
All right, just get to it.
What do you want from me?

42:42.602 --> 42:45.685
I'm not here to take. I'm here to warn.

42:45.772 --> 42:48.559
My nature draws me
to impending disaster,

42:48.650 --> 42:55.647
terror, tragedy, plague,
to bear witness.

42:55.741 --> 42:59.529
So, what's drawing you
here now? My love life?

42:59.619 --> 43:04.989
Just you. I don't know the specifics
yet, but I can feel it coming.

43:05.083 --> 43:07.699
Because the Light Fae's bond
with the land was broken?

43:07.794 --> 43:12.754
No. That will repair over time.
This is far worse.

43:14.134 --> 43:22.257
Something old has awoken. Something
terrible. It's coming straight for you.
