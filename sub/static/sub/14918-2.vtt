00:00.340 --> 00:01.340
Hi. Yes.

00:01.350 --> 00:04.890
I was wondering if I could make
an appointment with Dr. Avadon.

00:05.360 --> 00:08.340
Oh, no, no. Shes told me that she
would be able to squeeze me in.

00:09.050 --> 00:12.560
Oh, sorry. Uh, Kitty. Kitty McCallister.

00:12.700 --> 00:16.780
I was wondering also if maybe you
could tell me if my test results came in.

00:16.950 --> 00:18.580
She told me that they would be in today.

00:19.580 --> 00:20.570
Kern knows.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.310
No, you're right. Of course. I'm sorry.

00:22.540 --> 00:24.580
I'll... I'll call back later. Thank you.

00:24.810 --> 00:27.130
- It's unbelievable.
- I'm sorry, what'd you say?

00:27.300 --> 00:28.710
Kevin just called me when I was out on my run.

00:28.910 --> 00:30.550
Governor Kern knows about the heart attack.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.750
- You're kidding.
- Somebody's got my medical records.

00:33.020 --> 00:36.800
I mean, three months ago, we were telling every
news organization it was a minor arrhythmia.

00:36.810 --> 00:37.640
Well, I don't know.

00:37.860 --> 00:39.420
What are you what are you
what are you gonna do, Robert?

00:39.640 --> 00:41.880
Sometimes medical situations
are difficult to talk about.

00:42.060 --> 00:42.830
Kitty, you're a pundit.

00:43.040 --> 00:45.090
You know what kind of narrative
they're gonna write with this.

00:45.260 --> 00:47.360
"Senator McCallister misled us with a heart attack.

00:47.540 --> 00:51.080
He's untrustworthy, not to mention the fact
that he could drop dead at any moment.

00:51.090 --> 00:53.280
No, no, no, no, don't you worry, darling.

00:53.500 --> 00:55.710
Nobody's gonna be dropping dead
around here anytime soon.

00:55.720 --> 00:57.050
No, not yet.

00:57.060 --> 01:00.420
But this is exactly the kind of thing that could
derail this campaign before it even starts,

01:00.420 --> 01:01.630
which is probably okay with you.

01:01.640 --> 01:03.450
Oh, you know what, Robert?
Please don't start that.

01:03.460 --> 01:07.120
- That that's just not fair.
- Sorry. I just have a lot on my mind.

01:08.630 --> 01:10.120
so Shat are you gonna do?

01:10.460 --> 01:13.430
Well, I've gotten the Governor to
agree to meet me this morning.

01:13.600 --> 01:17.440
No shots have been fired, and I'm hopeful I
can come to some sort of an agreement.

01:17.650 --> 01:20.390
And she's not the only one
with opposition research.

01:21.780 --> 01:25.110
You know, I should've just told the
truth,  the minute I left the hospital.

01:25.250 --> 01:26.610
I don't know what I was thinking.

01:29.690 --> 01:32.650
You know, I was, uh, I was just calling the doctor.

01:32.660 --> 01:34.210
Oh, I thought you said he was okay.

01:36.040 --> 01:39.060
He's fine. He's fine. He is.

01:39.080 --> 01:41.600
- You want to go see your daddy?
- Hey...

01:41.610 --> 01:44.600
- There you go, baby.
- Hey, big boy.

01:45.900 --> 01:47.430
Wish me luck today.

01:55.460 --> 01:59.040
I know it's a little over the top, but I'm thinking
of making steak and eggs for breakfast.

01:59.050 --> 02:00.900
- How do you want yours?
- Bloody.

02:00.910 --> 02:02.470
Wait a minute. I've seen that look before.

02:02.670 --> 02:03.820
What look?

02:03.990 --> 02:07.050
The guy in the movie in the loin cloth
with a bone through his nose.

02:07.240 --> 02:09.120
Just promise me you'll think before you speak.

02:09.289 --> 02:10.830
Don't say anything you're gonna regret.

02:11.030 --> 02:12.640
Do you know who works for Governor Kern now?

02:12.950 --> 02:15.070
Travis March. Do you know what he used to do?

02:15.200 --> 02:17.280
He used to help run Robert's presidential campaign.

02:17.300 --> 02:19.900
I know exactly what I'm gonna say
to the mercenary little bitch.

02:20.080 --> 02:22.510
He probably went to the hospital
and stole Robert's chart himself.

02:22.520 --> 02:24.280
"Bitch"? You're off to a really good start.

02:24.300 --> 02:25.960
You know what? He wears loafers with argyle socks.

02:25.970 --> 02:27.050
What would you call him?

02:27.060 --> 02:29.130
I don't know. European?

02:29.140 --> 02:30.050
I just hope you know what you're doing.

02:30.060 --> 02:31.600
Oh, yeah. We're prepared.

02:31.790 --> 02:32.990
Hope to put an end to it this morning.

02:33.020 --> 02:37.150
Oh, and if it does go smoothly, I thought
we could go to Lucques for dinner tonight.

02:37.160 --> 02:40.520
Doug and Barry are gonna be there.
They got a table on the patio.

02:40.530 --> 02:41.720
Last time we hung out with them,

02:41.720 --> 02:44.680
you said it was like chewing on chili peppers
with a mouth full of canker sores.

02:45.490 --> 02:47.930
Yeah, you know, I... I meant that
in the best possible way.

02:49.890 --> 02:51.530
Wait a minute. The patio?

02:51.870 --> 02:53.700
They're bringing their baby, aren't they?

02:54.210 --> 02:55.710
I... I don't know. Maybe.

02:55.920 --> 02:58.590
Well, she is kind of adorable.
She's still got that new baby smell.

02:58.600 --> 02:59.460
Kevin, I am so on to you.

02:59.470 --> 03:02.220
I said I don't want to be pressured
about the whole surrogacy thing.

03:02.230 --> 03:03.920
I'm not pressuring.

03:04.610 --> 03:06.410
I... I'm nudging.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.210
- I don't want to talk about the baby thing right now.
- Fine.

03:08.450 --> 03:10.290
No more baby talk. Promise.

03:10.300 --> 03:12.660
- Won't even coo in your ear
- Thank you.

03:12.880 --> 03:17.100
And next time you feel like bullying someone,
save it for your friend in the argyle socks.

03:19.000 --> 03:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:32.500 --> 03:34.200
It's gonna get soggy.

03:34.390 --> 03:36.030
Uh, yeah. You know, it's Granola.

03:36.040 --> 03:38.850
- I'm not too worried about it.
- Oh, my!

03:39.070 --> 03:41.890
They found a feral child in Michigan.
I didn't even know those were real.

03:41.900 --> 03:43.350
Apparently, he was.

03:44.080 --> 03:45.670
I'm sorry.

03:49.900 --> 03:51.240
Your scaphoid.

03:51.950 --> 03:54.950
Your radius, your ulna, your lunate.

03:59.860 --> 04:02.100
Your ulna... I'm... I'm... you
know what Rebecca? I'm sorry.

04:02.110 --> 04:03.850
That's a little distracting right now.

04:04.520 --> 04:06.810
Well, I can't exactly clean quieter.

04:06.820 --> 04:09.610
Well, I... I don't understand why
you have to do that right now.

04:10.110 --> 04:11.600
You're right. I'm sorry.

04:13.500 --> 04:14.890
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

04:15.060 --> 04:17.089
You know, I'm not trying to be a jerk here.

04:17.269 --> 04:19.380
But I can't memorize the bones of the wrist,

04:19.380 --> 04:22.089
let alone graduate if I don't
have time to focus, okay?

04:22.230 --> 04:25.650
So... is there is there anything else
you could be doing right now?

04:25.660 --> 04:28.300
Like what? I'm just doing things that
people do around the house.

04:28.310 --> 04:31.270
I'm sorry if I have a job where I can
actually finish my work at work.

04:32.380 --> 04:35.390
To be honest, I wish I was
a little more inspired right now.

04:36.650 --> 04:38.010
Uh, the the flowers.

04:38.020 --> 04:39.710
Didn't you didn't you want to get the flowers,
you know, for our wedding?

04:39.720 --> 04:42.410
I already did that, Justin. Forget it.

04:42.680 --> 04:45.450
Maybe your mom can give you
more work or some I love you.

04:47.750 --> 04:48.910
Hello, everyone.

04:49.070 --> 04:50.060
Morning, Robert.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.890
Travis, it's good to see you.
Governor, you should watch him.

04:53.900 --> 04:58.550
He'll do anything to win, which is
uh, I guess why we're here.

04:58.750 --> 05:01.720
To tell you the truth, Robert,
my first reaction was just concern.

05:01.900 --> 05:04.060
It's always unpleasant to find out
that a friend has health problems.

05:04.070 --> 05:05.290
Well, thank you.

05:05.440 --> 05:07.380
If it makes you feel any better, I'm fine now.

05:07.660 --> 05:11.410
Uh, according to my pedometer
I ran 4 1/2 miles this morning.

05:11.780 --> 05:12.730
Impressive.

05:12.910 --> 05:15.770
On that particular day, however,
you didn't run anywhere, did you?

05:16.240 --> 05:17.940
No.

05:18.400 --> 05:19.610
No, I spent most of that one in bed.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.090
I assume you've had all this confirmed.

05:21.100 --> 05:22.990
We have a copy of the doctor's report.

05:23.660 --> 05:24.830
There are hipa laws against that.

05:24.840 --> 05:27.350
Hey, it just landed on my desk.
I don't know how it got there.

05:27.360 --> 05:31.810
I think what concerns me is that you were not
exactly truthful about what's in that report.

05:31.820 --> 05:33.090
We didn't exactly lie, either.

05:33.250 --> 05:35.150
That depends on what your
definition of a heart attack is.

05:35.160 --> 05:36.790
What's your definition of an affair?

05:37.060 --> 05:40.250
I thought my problems were
purely anecdotal, Robert.

05:40.390 --> 05:44.250
We have receipts for airline tickets, hotel rooms
and some great pictures on my computer.

05:44.860 --> 05:46.540
Mexico I imagine.

05:46.720 --> 05:48.000
Looks like you're having a good time.

05:48.190 --> 05:49.600
Just isn't with your husband.

05:49.610 --> 05:50.930
Now how'd you get those?

05:50.940 --> 05:52.780
Landed on my desk.

05:53.250 --> 05:55.540
So what? An affair is not gonna take us down.

05:55.550 --> 05:57.360
And a heart attack has legs? Come on, Travis.

05:57.370 --> 05:59.300
Sex fuels the media. You know that.

05:59.480 --> 06:02.160
Look, this is an uncomfortable
conversation for both of us.

06:02.360 --> 06:06.540
I think it's safe to say that we both bring sufficient
weaponry to the table to destroy each other.

06:06.730 --> 06:12.230
So if it's okay with you, I'd like to suggest
that we don't launch a first strike.

06:12.500 --> 06:16.450
I mean, because personally, I'd like to
avoid mutually assured destruction.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
It would create tense but stable peace.

06:21.420 --> 06:23.050
Worked during the cold war.

06:25.830 --> 06:28.360
- I have no problem with that.
- Good.

06:29.020 --> 06:30.920
- Then it's settled.
- Settled.

06:35.790 --> 06:37.520
Mom?

06:45.320 --> 06:47.400
Hello.

06:48.490 --> 06:49.200
Kitty.

06:50.330 --> 06:51.380
I just, um...

06:51.560 --> 06:54.370
I had to be in the city, and, uh, as I was driving,

06:54.370 --> 06:56.890
I... I realized that I had some time to spare, so

06:57.090 --> 06:59.120
I am so glad you're here.
Kitty, go swimming with me.

06:59.130 --> 07:00.400
I've been swimming every day.

07:00.540 --> 07:01.670
- Oh, you know, mom.
- It's so fabulous.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.920
I can't... I can't. I... I have an appointment.

07:04.190 --> 07:06.510
Well, at least have some of this fabulous water.

07:06.690 --> 07:09.820
I put cucumbers and lemon. It makes
you drink more water every day.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.280
Here, drink it down.

07:11.290 --> 07:13.350
Um, the appointment that I have
is a doctor's appointment.

07:13.360 --> 07:15.660
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah...

07:20.460 --> 07:22.070
Uh, no.

07:23.710 --> 07:25.130
I'm sorry that I didn't call.

07:25.330 --> 07:27.830
And I would've gone to Sarah, but obviously,

07:27.830 --> 07:30.290
she's still in France, and Kevin is busy.

07:30.500 --> 07:33.160
- And I don't want to worry you
- Kitty, what's happening?

07:33.170 --> 07:35.730
I don't know. I don't know.

07:35.960 --> 07:40.960
I was just in the pediatrician's office
with Evan, and she said that I looked pale.

07:41.130 --> 07:43.800
You know, which is my complexion, okay?

07:43.980 --> 07:48.010
But whatever. She suggested that
I get a blood test.

07:48.580 --> 07:50.360
Did they find something?

07:51.240 --> 07:53.870
They think I'm sick.

07:54.090 --> 07:55.670
What do you mean, "sick"?

07:56.450 --> 07:58.960
She sent me to an oncologist.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.520
- Oh, God, Kitty.
- Oh, no, no, don't don't, mom.

08:01.960 --> 08:04.520
Don't freak out. They don't know anything yet.

08:04.530 --> 08:07.650
I just have this, um, enlarged lymph node here.

08:07.820 --> 08:11.710
And, they removed some of the
cells,  I guess, with a needle,

08:11.840 --> 08:15.430
and then and then she said that
some of the cells were irregular.

08:15.540 --> 08:17.520
- What does that mean, "irregular"?
- They they don't know.

08:17.820 --> 08:21.100
So they they sent them to a lab
to do some more tests.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.470
And I'm supposed to go in today
to get the results, and...

08:23.670 --> 08:27.530
all I keep thinking about is Evan and...

08:27.540 --> 08:29.930
Kitty, stop it. Now stop it. Don't go there.

08:29.940 --> 08:33.100
- They said they don't know everything.
- You're right. I know...

08:34.840 --> 08:36.039
I'm sorry.

08:36.570 --> 08:41.830
But anyway, they told me that they don't,
they don't want me to go alone.

08:41.840 --> 08:44.440
Wait right here. It'll take me
one minute. Don't move.

08:44.660 --> 08:46.110
I'll be ready in one minute.

09:00.130 --> 09:01.700
Well, I told you, the numbers are not good.

09:01.830 --> 09:03.360
Not good? We're hemorrhaging money.

09:03.510 --> 09:06.280
Holly, the luxury market is down,
and our wines aren't cheap.

09:06.860 --> 09:09.850
I tried calling Sarah last night,
but it's nine hours later in France.

09:10.020 --> 09:11.170
She's not gonna be any help.

09:11.350 --> 09:14.090
- She's over there touring high end vineyards.
- Yeah...

09:14.460 --> 09:17.090
Just so you'll know, I have Ryan looking
into other venture streams.

09:17.230 --> 09:18.910
- Ryan?
- Yes, Ryan.

09:19.080 --> 09:21.680
And believe it or not, he's showing a
real talent for this kind of work.

09:21.690 --> 09:24.250
- Hey. Oh, uh, am I interrupting anything?
- No no no...

09:24.260 --> 09:25.380
Hi, sweetie.

09:25.600 --> 09:29.630
Okay, so we've got 20, 000 gallons of
wine that we can't afford to age.

09:29.780 --> 09:31.410
So what are we gonna do with the glut?

09:31.420 --> 09:33.530
That's one of the things
I have Ryan looking into.

09:33.920 --> 09:35.130
Well, can I help with anything?

09:35.590 --> 09:37.410
Aren't you working on the market surveys?

09:37.420 --> 09:38.950
Yeah, they're done.
They've been done for days.

09:39.140 --> 09:42.100
That's actually why I'm here.
I'm dying to do more around here.

09:42.270 --> 09:44.740
Well, Saul, why don't you bring her
up to speed with what's going on,

09:44.740 --> 09:45.890
and we'll see what she can do?

09:46.050 --> 09:49.260
Well, I told you, Holly, I already
have Ryan working on that.

09:49.420 --> 09:50.940
I don't think that's a problem.

09:51.680 --> 09:54.030
Ojai could use a little friendly competition.

09:54.210 --> 09:55.720
I don't want to step on anyone's toes, mom.

09:55.730 --> 09:57.940
Sweetie, if you want to get more involved,

09:57.940 --> 10:01.150
you can't be worrying about
stepping on other people's toes.

10:01.670 --> 10:02.880
Okay.

10:03.280 --> 10:04.840
Saul, fill me in.

10:13.650 --> 10:15.160
Would you like some gum?

10:15.690 --> 10:17.990
Uh, no, thanks. I'm fine.

10:19.600 --> 10:23.950
- I've got some calcium chews.
- No, thank you. Fine.

10:26.880 --> 10:29.890
So does Robert even know
where you are right now?

10:30.080 --> 10:31.580
Uh, no.

10:31.760 --> 10:33.470
He's in the middle of a crisis.

10:33.480 --> 10:34.820
But I know what you're thinking, and, mom,

10:34.940 --> 10:39.280
I just... I just want to find out what's going on before
I have to talk about it to the rest of the world, okay?

10:39.390 --> 10:40.700
Well, he's not exactly the rest of the world, sweet...

10:40.710 --> 10:43.450
- Mom. Please don't do this, okay?
- All right.

10:43.460 --> 10:45.510
- This is unpleasant enough as it is.
- Sorry. Okay...

10:45.550 --> 10:46.910
I just don't...

10:47.220 --> 10:48.770
Hi, Kitty.

10:50.630 --> 10:52.010
Um, this is my mom.

10:52.240 --> 10:54.940
- Hi, I'm Nora Walker.
- Hi, Joan Avadon.

10:54.960 --> 10:56.310
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

10:56.460 --> 11:00.760
Please. It wouldn't be like a real
doctor if we didn't have to wait.

11:01.220 --> 11:03.660
You know, it's not like you're
out there popping zits.

11:04.710 --> 11:05.930
She's a little nervous.

11:07.260 --> 11:09.460
I guess anybody who was sitting
in this chair would be absolutely.

11:09.530 --> 11:11.620
- Would be nervous, right?
- Be very nervous.

11:12.090 --> 11:16.860
Well, Kitty, um, I've looked over the pathology
report and your blood work, and, um...

11:17.360 --> 11:20.510
it looks like you have lymphoma.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.310
Okay.

11:24.970 --> 11:26.910
It's cancer of the lymph nodes.

11:27.430 --> 11:31.520
What kind of lymphoma? I run a
nonprofit home for cancer patients.

11:31.530 --> 11:35.960
Well, this is a diffuse large B-cell tumor,
which is a non hodgkins lymphoma.

11:35.970 --> 11:37.490
Okay.

11:39.400 --> 11:42.920
So how do we proceed
radiation, chemotherapy?

11:42.940 --> 11:44.780
Before we talk about treatment,
we need to get more information.

11:44.930 --> 11:46.610
We need to find out if it's spread.

11:46.620 --> 11:50.160
So that's why we need to get a C.
scan and a bone marrow biopsy,

11:50.550 --> 11:52.690
both of which I'd like to schedule immediately.

11:52.700 --> 11:55.070
Okay. We could just do that right away, right?

11:55.080 --> 11:57.550
Yeah. Cathy can schedule that for you.

12:01.400 --> 12:05.670
Listen, Kitty, I know you're overwhelmed.

12:05.850 --> 12:10.480
And it's hard to take all of this in, but I really
need you to hear what I'm about to say.

12:11.160 --> 12:15.770
This is a highly treatable and
potentially curable disease.

12:18.110 --> 12:21.920
- Kitty?
- Oh, yeah. yes

12:22.480 --> 12:26.560
Um, I need a bone marrow biopsy.

12:26.860 --> 12:28.320
Okay.

12:39.810 --> 12:42.300
You know, I've got a half a
chicken in the refrigerator.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.100
I could wrap it up.
You could take it home with you.

12:44.280 --> 12:48.880
Oh, mom, you keep saying the word
"home, " and I literally want to kill you.

12:49.050 --> 12:50.200
I... I want to help you.

12:50.380 --> 12:52.370
- I know you have a family waiting for you there.
- Oh, believe me.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.090
That's all I'm thinking about.

12:55.310 --> 12:57.820
You are gonna talk to him about this today?

12:57.990 --> 12:59.330
Of course I'm gonna tell him.

12:59.500 --> 13:02.800
It's just it's very hard

13:02.960 --> 13:04.030
Well, I've got an idea.

13:04.040 --> 13:06.770
How about if I take Evan for a few days?

13:06.960 --> 13:09.460
- It would give you and Robert a chance to talk...
- Oh, I don't know.

13:09.630 --> 13:11.110
I don't know, mom.

13:11.280 --> 13:14.590
It's just that Robert just has
so much going on right now.

13:14.600 --> 13:16.310
Kitty, you have cancer.

13:16.320 --> 13:19.550
- I'm sure your husband can take time out...
- You don't know Robert.

13:19.560 --> 13:22.370
Yes, I do. Don't be silly.

13:23.010 --> 13:25.130
Okay, well, what am I supposed to say, mom?

13:25.390 --> 13:27.640
Hi, honey. I have cancer.

13:27.920 --> 13:30.150
How was your day? I just...

13:30.330 --> 13:33.090
Oh, God. This is so crazy.

13:33.650 --> 13:35.100
It's so weird.

13:37.100 --> 13:39.400
I mean, what's gonna happen
when I lose my hair?

13:39.560 --> 13:42.540
I love my hair.

13:42.710 --> 13:43.980
It'll grow back.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.740
What if it grows back curly?

13:45.930 --> 13:49.120
Kitty, stop. Stop, stop, stop.

13:50.140 --> 13:51.380
Okay.

13:51.910 --> 13:54.170
If there's one thing I've learned
from my life, my marriage,

13:54.280 --> 14:04.130
it's that facing the truth is so much easier than
all the time and energy it takes to run away from it.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.820
Okay.

14:08.220 --> 14:10.490
When do you want me to bring Evan over?

14:11.380 --> 14:12.890
Okay, great. Thank you.

14:13.080 --> 14:14.650
Your cardiologist is gonna
call back in a half an hour.

14:14.660 --> 14:16.630
All right. We need to think about
getting all of this out there.

14:16.640 --> 14:18.250
I had a hernia in '98.

14:18.260 --> 14:21.690
Not that that would affect my being
governor, but people should know.

14:21.870 --> 14:23.140
Wow, you really trust her.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.780
Well, as a matter of fact,
I do, but if they have the information,

14:25.780 --> 14:28.040
then eventually everybody's
gonna have the information.

14:28.340 --> 14:30.450
I mean, we weren't gonna be
sitting on this forever.

14:30.660 --> 14:33.340
Well, then we should do a focus group.
Test different ways of talking about it.

14:33.350 --> 14:35.740
- Hi.
- Hi, honey. How are you?

14:35.870 --> 14:38.680
- What's happening over there?
- Just working.

14:38.690 --> 14:41.120
The president of the California
teachers association arrived.

14:41.130 --> 14:42.780
You wanted to take a look at these
before you met with him.

14:42.790 --> 14:44.190
I'm taking Evan for a few days.

14:44.310 --> 14:46.310
- Wow. Does Kitty know?
- Ha ha. Very funny.

14:46.470 --> 14:49.590
No, I... I just thought they
needed some time alone.

14:49.760 --> 14:51.690
Oh, well, then you know what?
I might swing by.

14:51.850 --> 14:54.090
I'll bring Scotty. Evan is kind of irresistible.

14:54.100 --> 14:56.170
Fine. Whatever you want to do. That's just fine.

14:56.370 --> 14:58.610
Uh, Kevin, how's Robert?

14:58.780 --> 15:00.180
He's not working late tonight, is he?

15:00.190 --> 15:02.660
Uh, no. It's pretty calm here for a change.

15:02.670 --> 15:06.110
Oh, good. Look, don't get him all riled
up before he goes home.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.650
He's he's unflappable.

15:07.860 --> 15:09.120
Oh, I hope so.

15:09.300 --> 15:10.890
I really hope so.

15:11.030 --> 15:12.180
What's that supposed to mean?

15:12.360 --> 15:13.650
Nothing.

15:13.660 --> 15:14.760
- Who is that?
- Mom.

15:14.770 --> 15:15.790
Tell her I said I hi.

15:16.570 --> 15:19.180
- Oh, Robert says hi, but I gotta go...
- Kevin!

15:19.390 --> 15:22.570
Kevin, make sure he gets home
at a reasonable time.

15:22.580 --> 15:24.060
Okay, I'll try. Love you. Bye.

15:24.470 --> 15:27.030
All right, I'm gonna go meet this
teacher,  and then I'll be right back,

15:27.040 --> 15:28.400
but I still have that tv thing, right?

15:28.410 --> 15:29.510
Yeah, tomorrow.

15:29.520 --> 15:33.430
Uh, energy security. You know, developing
alternative fuels, etc, etc.

15:36.180 --> 15:37.530
Oh, my God.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.370
She didn't wait a day.

15:41.060 --> 15:43.400
- Let me get the volume.
- Don't bother.

15:43.960 --> 15:45.570
I already know what they're saying.

15:53.190 --> 15:53.860
Oh, um, go ahead.

15:54.070 --> 15:56.450
- No, ladies first.
- Oh, thanks.

15:57.340 --> 16:00.870
Um, you know, I was just talking to my mom,
and she was asking me to look into

16:00.880 --> 16:04.290
I'm sorry. Rebecca, Dan's on the phone for you.

16:04.470 --> 16:06.990
Um, you can just tell him I'll call him back.

16:07.140 --> 16:09.930
I think he just wants to give you the
gallon count on our surplus wine.

16:09.940 --> 16:11.480
Actually, I think those are for me. Thank you.

16:11.490 --> 16:12.730
Tell him I already got 'em.

16:13.450 --> 16:16.060
Um, yeah, that's kind of what
I wanted to talk to you about.

16:16.240 --> 16:19.270
See, my mom asked me
to look into the glut, too.

16:19.440 --> 16:20.370
Oh, she did?

16:20.640 --> 16:21.800
Yeah.

16:21.990 --> 16:24.070
So wait. Um, I'm confused.

16:24.280 --> 16:26.790
Does that mean that she wants
us to work on it together?

16:27.310 --> 16:28.960
Um. yeah, yeah.

16:29.170 --> 16:30.940
I mean, well, I mean, I... I think that, you know,

16:30.950 --> 16:33.360
they kind of want us to, you know,
come up with some ideas,

16:33.360 --> 16:35.060
and then I don't know, maybe just choose.

16:35.350 --> 16:38.470
Okay. So they want us to
play a little one on one.

16:38.730 --> 16:42.560
- Is that a problem?
- No, no, bring it on.

16:42.920 --> 16:43.980
This is a little weird, isn't it?

16:43.990 --> 16:45.160
No, it's not weird.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.460
Actually, I'll have him fax you
a copy of the numbers, too.

16:47.600 --> 16:50.610
- Okay, cool. I'll see you later.
- See you later.

16:53.800 --> 16:54.670
We have pictures.

16:54.680 --> 16:58.890
This is the perfect opportunity to label her
as a two faced, republican philanderer.

16:58.900 --> 17:01.320
- Let it go
- I'm... I'm sorry. I don't understand.

17:01.530 --> 17:02.480
Why why can't we hit back?

17:02.530 --> 17:05.420
Because is is exactly the kind
of politics that people hate.

17:05.609 --> 17:07.220
Her turn, my turn.

17:07.230 --> 17:09.599
I have enough trouble running against
an incumbent from my own party.

17:09.609 --> 17:11.359
What do you care? You're
not the head of the R.N.C.

17:11.369 --> 17:12.599
You're just trying to win an election.

17:12.609 --> 17:15.990
And what do you suggest, that Kern and I keep
knocking each other till we're both lying in the dirt,

17:15.990 --> 17:17.470
and let a democrat take the oath of office?

17:17.480 --> 17:19.640
The general election is not for a year.

17:19.819 --> 17:21.500
People will have forgotten your fight with Kern.

17:21.670 --> 17:23.660
And you know what? Let
the party go down in flames.

17:23.839 --> 17:25.770
It's people like you who should rise in its place.

17:25.780 --> 17:28.160
And what am I, a guy that
wants to score political points'

17:28.160 --> 17:30.030
cause I caught my opponent with her skirt up?

17:31.230 --> 17:32.990
I still have to live with myself.

17:33.580 --> 17:35.520
You know, when my family came to California,

17:35.520 --> 17:38.590
this state was the envy of a country
that was the envy of the world.

17:39.700 --> 17:42.540
And I want to get us back there
but I can't do that like this.

17:42.710 --> 17:45.260
She is calling you a liar while lying herself.

17:45.470 --> 17:47.330
That's an issue. It's called hypocrisy.

17:48.330 --> 17:49.900
We're going to talk about the heart attack.

17:49.910 --> 17:51.970
I am going to tell everybody that I am fine.

17:52.140 --> 17:54.550
It is gonna play itself out,
and that's all we have to hide.

17:56.360 --> 17:57.560
Now I'm cutting out early.

17:57.750 --> 17:59.350
- So should you.
- What?

17:59.540 --> 18:01.960
And by the way, I don't think
she knew anything about it.

18:02.360 --> 18:04.720
I think this is all Travis trying to play hardball.

18:20.710 --> 18:23.110
- What took you so long?
- Got hung up in a meeting.

18:23.470 --> 18:24.690
What do you got for me?

18:24.930 --> 18:25.970
Here.

18:27.550 --> 18:28.570
Am I gonna like it?

18:28.580 --> 18:30.570
Yeah, it comes with pictures and hotel receipts.

18:31.040 --> 18:33.230
- That's always a good thing.
- Have fun with it.

18:36.760 --> 18:38.650
Things at Ojai aren't going well.

18:38.820 --> 18:39.880
I mean, I'm aware of that.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.640
But even though she doesn't mean it, Holly
just makes things worse sometimes.

18:42.790 --> 18:45.090
I told you how great Ryan was
doing at the job, didn't I?

18:45.260 --> 18:46.840
- Yeah. Pass me the water.
- Yeah, sure.

18:47.050 --> 18:48.560
Anyway, he's doing a fantastic job.

18:48.710 --> 18:51.410
He just sees things in a totally different way.

18:51.570 --> 18:54.520
So I asked him to figure out what we
could do with the excessive amount of grapes.

18:54.530 --> 18:55.480
And wouldn't you know it?

18:55.630 --> 18:59.250
Impulsively, Holly just gets Rebecca
involved in it. Do you believe that?

18:59.260 --> 19:00.460
No, I don't.

19:00.470 --> 19:04.410
And... and... and now she has them squared off
against each other like a couple of pitbulls...

19:04.420 --> 19:06.650
Oh, do we really have to talk about this right now?

19:06.660 --> 19:08.330
Can't we talk about something else?

19:08.500 --> 19:11.330
I don't give a rat's ass about Holly or grapes.

19:11.450 --> 19:13.460
The world does not revolve around Ojai Foods.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.130
Please, let's talk about something else.

19:15.290 --> 19:17.850
God, I'm just really not in the mood to chat.

19:18.030 --> 19:22.220
I'm sorry, Saul. I'm... I've gotta go.
Evan's waking up. I've gotta go.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.010
It's lymphoma.

19:28.380 --> 19:33.720
They... they don't know what the prognosis is yet,
and... but it... it doesn't matter how bad it is.

19:33.900 --> 19:35.620
I... I need you and...

19:39.390 --> 19:42.490
That was the longest ride home.

19:42.500 --> 19:44.850
I finally just had to get out of the office.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.000
Where's Evan? Is he already asleep?

19:47.300 --> 19:51.650
Uh, no, no. Actually, I, um, well, he...
he's spending the night with my mom.

19:51.910 --> 19:54.280
Thank you for that. All right. Give it to me.

19:56.250 --> 19:57.570
How bad is it?

20:00.160 --> 20:01.500
Well, what... what do you mean?

20:02.640 --> 20:04.080
Oh, God. Did you...

20:04.760 --> 20:06.170
did you talk to my mother?

20:07.030 --> 20:09.110
No, she's the one person I haven't talked to.

20:09.280 --> 20:10.570
But it's... it's everywhere,

20:10.570 --> 20:14.930
and I don't think anyone's being straight
with me about what the fallout's gonna be.

20:15.410 --> 20:17.030
Oh, my God. It's... it's the heart attack?

20:17.200 --> 20:20.290
You're talking about the heart
attack? Kern actually leaked it?

20:20.490 --> 20:21.880
You're kidding me, right?

20:22.060 --> 20:23.820
- You didn't know about this until just now?
- No...

20:24.010 --> 20:26.480
- No, I'm sorry...
- Kitty, this is breaking news.

20:26.650 --> 20:28.710
It's... it's everywhere. And I...

20:29.070 --> 20:30.370
you knew what I was going through today.

20:30.550 --> 20:32.520
You knew what I was up against. You didn't even call me.

20:32.710 --> 20:34.160
Robert, there's a very good reason.

20:34.300 --> 20:37.110
Well, I'd love to hear it, because for someone
who claims to want this marriage to work,

20:37.110 --> 20:38.240
you have a funny way of showing it.

20:38.250 --> 20:39.380
Hello.

20:40.620 --> 20:42.310
Okay, put 'em on hold.

20:43.100 --> 20:44.560
It's my top three donors.

20:44.700 --> 20:46.570
They don't think the campaign's gonna last a week.

20:46.760 --> 20:50.740
So I'm... I'm done fighting. I'm
just gonna take care of this.

20:51.690 --> 20:54.440
Well, I got the Governor to agree to meet me this morning.

21:06.100 --> 21:07.660
So how upset was he?

21:07.810 --> 21:10.420
Considering everything, he was remarkably stoic.

21:10.550 --> 21:12.660
I just can't believe this is happening right now.

21:12.790 --> 21:14.910
Well, at least you have Evan here, right?

21:15.040 --> 21:17.390
Well, I was hoping they would
have time to talk about.

21:17.530 --> 21:18.850
Something other than work.

21:18.970 --> 21:21.170
I notice that Governor Kern
has a few problems of her own.

21:21.290 --> 21:22.240
What do you mean?

21:22.390 --> 21:23.160
She had an affair.

21:23.280 --> 21:24.860
I saw it online.

21:24.980 --> 21:25.650
Really.

21:26.460 --> 21:28.110
Wait, how do I know this and you don't?

21:28.230 --> 21:29.700
Well, no. I... I heard the rumors.

21:29.820 --> 21:31.410
I just wasn't sure if they were true.

21:31.540 --> 21:34.660
Well, maybe Robert will feel better that.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.060
Where's Evan?

21:36.220 --> 21:37.950
Did you get him to go to sleep?

21:38.080 --> 21:38.730
Yeah.

21:38.870 --> 21:39.740
I can't believe it.

21:39.880 --> 21:41.890
He's been fussing and
crying for a straight hour.

21:42.020 --> 21:43.210
They are so cute together.

21:43.330 --> 21:44.470
He's like the baby whisperer.

21:44.600 --> 21:46.390
Well, if he's the baby whisperer, then what am I?

21:46.520 --> 21:47.390
Probably the baby annoyer.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.630
He's just trying to be nice to me
so he can get what he wants.

21:49.740 --> 21:50.360
No, not at all.

21:50.500 --> 21:52.180
All I'm saying is, you're great with kids.

21:52.290 --> 21:53.940
Well, that's because I live with one.

21:54.040 --> 21:55.050
Nora, why don't you take a break?

21:55.150 --> 21:56.620
I'll... I'll take over for a bit.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.710
- I'm fine.
- No, you're exhausted. I get it.

21:58.840 --> 22:00.000
I'm not exhausted.

22:00.130 --> 22:02.840
Well, Kevin told me you've
been complaining, so I thought...

22:02.970 --> 22:04.020
I've been complaining?

22:04.160 --> 22:05.590
- No, no, no.
- Oh, Kevin!

22:05.790 --> 22:07.560
I said you're probably exhausted.

22:07.750 --> 22:09.700
Will you please tell your son to
stop making these playdates for me?

22:09.800 --> 22:11.340
Kevin, I love babies, okay?

22:11.450 --> 22:12.870
That doesn't mean I want one...

22:12.990 --> 22:14.000
- I have to take this.
- Oh, sure.

22:14.130 --> 22:15.430
Hi, what's going on?

22:15.580 --> 22:18.810
No, just hanging with mom,
Scotty and your son.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.750
Is that Robert?

22:21.920 --> 22:24.350
Wo... I.. wh.. I have no idea
what you're talking about.

22:24.500 --> 22:27.350
Yeah, I can come right now if you want.

22:28.110 --> 22:29.810
All right. I'll... I'll be there as soon as I can.

22:29.910 --> 22:31.380
But, no. All I'm...

22:31.570 --> 22:32.410
- He hung up.
- What?

22:32.540 --> 22:33.180
What's wrong?

22:34.610 --> 22:36.440
I think he's a little upset with me right now.

22:36.560 --> 22:37.240
Is it about Kitty?

22:37.530 --> 22:38.100
No, believe me.

22:38.220 --> 22:39.460
This is not a marital issue.

22:39.580 --> 22:40.980
I have to go to Santa Barbara, so...

22:41.100 --> 22:42.170
- I'll call you later.
- Wait. Santa Barbara?

22:42.320 --> 22:43.800
What's going... Kevin.

22:43.940 --> 22:46.390
Kevin. I can't believe this.

22:46.520 --> 22:48.070
Wait. Wait. Who's gonna take me home?

22:48.240 --> 22:49.980
- Kevin!
- Kevin!

22:50.910 --> 22:51.800
Unbelievable.

22:51.920 --> 22:53.210
- Well, I could take you home.
- No, it's okay.

22:53.370 --> 22:55.060
You have Evan. I'll...

22:55.280 --> 22:56.720
I'll take a cab.

22:57.700 --> 23:01.330
Now I think we could break even by
selling it to an even larger producer.

23:01.490 --> 23:03.960
Every vintner in the state has excess.

23:04.080 --> 23:06.470
And the brokers are setting rock bottom prices.

23:06.580 --> 23:09.260
And that's why I say we cut out the
middle man and just sell it ourselves.

23:09.360 --> 23:12.020
We have the connections to go direct,
and we could save that 8%.

23:12.140 --> 23:14.860
And for all this extra effort, all we do is break even?

23:14.970 --> 23:15.530
Come on, Holly.

23:15.670 --> 23:16.840
8% is nothing to scoff at.

23:16.980 --> 23:20.240
Yeah, I know. But it's not exactly gonna save the company.

23:20.360 --> 23:21.870
Rebecca, what do you have for us?

23:21.990 --> 23:24.120
Actually, what I'm proposing
is... is a little bit different.

23:24.230 --> 23:25.690
I think that we should keep the excess juice.

23:25.790 --> 23:27.870
No, I already explained that's not an option.

23:27.990 --> 23:30.460
Well, no. You said aging it isn't an option.

23:30.580 --> 23:32.000
I think we should ferment it and sell it.

23:32.120 --> 23:33.340
So you want to make cheap wine?

23:33.470 --> 23:34.310
Inexpensive wine.

23:34.570 --> 23:35.250
It's still our grapes.

23:35.380 --> 23:38.660
Cannibalize the entire Ojai name
just to sell off a bunch of grapes?

23:38.780 --> 23:40.110
If anything, sweetheart,

23:40.230 --> 23:43.150
Ojai has always stood for quality in the marketplace.
- Saul, let her finish.

23:43.270 --> 23:47.790
No, no, I understand your objections, which is
why I'd create a second label an affordable,

23:47.970 --> 23:50.640
economy, conscious but decent third shelf offering.

23:50.770 --> 23:52.330
Simple label, screw cap.

23:52.450 --> 23:53.410
A screw cap?

23:53.540 --> 23:57.140
I... I... I don't... I don't know what to say about that.

23:57.240 --> 24:00.830
If we sold each bottle for $2 or
$3, we'd profit 50 cents each.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.170
Plus the expense of marketing a brand new label.

24:03.280 --> 24:05.120
Which would pay for itself once we start to sell.

24:05.220 --> 24:07.210
If it starts to sell.

24:07.340 --> 24:09.060
That's true. There is some risk.

24:09.170 --> 24:10.110
That's putting it mildly.

24:10.220 --> 24:10.820
I'll tell you what,

24:10.930 --> 24:15.350
why don't you find the sales figures for
wine at that price and get back to me?

24:15.480 --> 24:16.280
Saul, we gotta go.

24:16.400 --> 24:17.310
We're late for Vincenti.

24:17.450 --> 24:19.130
Vincenti and Maureen. Yeah, okay.

24:19.240 --> 24:21.120
Uh, you understand this is all about business, right?

24:21.230 --> 24:22.090
- Yeah, yeah, of course.
- All right.

24:22.200 --> 24:23.620
- You did a good job, kid.
- Oh, thanks.

24:23.750 --> 24:25.110
- Bye.
- Thank you.

24:26.930 --> 24:27.560
Wait. Was that...

24:27.760 --> 24:29.630
A green light?
Yeah, I think it was.

24:29.740 --> 24:31.220
That was a really good presentation.

24:31.340 --> 24:31.880
Thank you.

24:32.010 --> 24:33.200
It was a lot better than mine.

24:33.310 --> 24:34.600
No, yours was great.

24:35.040 --> 24:37.380
They get really intense about business, huh?

24:37.500 --> 24:42.250
Yeah, and sometimes I feel like
I'm caught right in the middle of it.

24:42.350 --> 24:43.790
Yeah, I know what you mean.

24:47.420 --> 24:50.020
You should see him, all curled up with his giraffe.

24:50.760 --> 24:52.140
Kevin's right. You're a natural.

24:52.260 --> 24:54.410
Oh, I wouldn't go that far.

24:54.540 --> 24:57.310
Scotty, what's going on
with all this baby stuff?

24:57.430 --> 24:59.190
What are you feeling? Why are you so afraid?

24:59.350 --> 25:03.310
Oh, I don't know my mother,
the things I grew up hearing.

25:03.410 --> 25:05.560
I mean, two gay dads.

25:05.700 --> 25:06.440
What if it's a boy?

25:06.580 --> 25:08.480
Who's gonna teach him how to bait a hook?

25:08.700 --> 25:09.440
Bait a hook?

25:09.580 --> 25:13.740
Yeah, or toss a football, beat up a
bully I don't know, defend himself.

25:13.870 --> 25:17.630
You have always been so comfortable with
yourself, from the very first time I met you,

25:17.760 --> 25:19.940
when your... your hair was all...

25:20.090 --> 25:21.530
- The toucan.
- The toucan.

25:21.960 --> 25:24.700
And you had a box of red velvet cupcakes.

25:25.130 --> 25:27.880
You seemed perfectly capable
of defending yourself.

25:28.010 --> 25:30.850
I'm not buying this whole "baiting the hook" routine.

25:31.130 --> 25:32.520
Fine.

25:33.290 --> 25:35.710
- You want to know the truth?
- Yes.

25:36.240 --> 25:39.380
It's about your son, so brace yourself.

25:39.500 --> 25:40.550
Oh, God. Now what?

25:40.690 --> 25:42.070
No, it's...

25:42.580 --> 25:43.760
He works too much.

25:43.880 --> 25:45.110
And that's never gonna change.

25:45.230 --> 25:49.050
We weren't here ten minutes before his phone
rang and he was out the door again.

25:49.160 --> 25:49.840
Well, you have a job.

25:49.980 --> 25:53.750
I know I run a kitchen at a very major restaurant.

25:53.860 --> 25:57.370
I don't know how he thinks
we're gonna be able to do this.

25:57.910 --> 25:59.980
Have you told him what you feel?

26:00.110 --> 26:00.850
No.

26:00.980 --> 26:05.930
So far, we've only been able to talk about
the money, which is a lot, by the way.

26:06.100 --> 26:10.460
Well, Scotty, you have to talk to him,
because, believe me, I know Kevin.

26:10.580 --> 26:15.860
And the moment he sees his child,
he will adjust his life to make room.

26:15.990 --> 26:17.520
I know, because when you look down at

26:17.680 --> 26:25.940
that little person they just simply own you the
rest of your life, and all that matters is that.

26:26.320 --> 26:27.670
Nora, are you all right?

26:27.810 --> 26:28.970
Yes.

26:30.870 --> 26:32.260
Yes.

26:32.690 --> 26:36.270
I just think you will be a wonderful dad.

26:36.920 --> 26:41.410
Well, don't worry. I'm keeping an open mind.

26:43.520 --> 26:45.450
Why do you just assume that I did it?

26:45.570 --> 26:48.030
You said yourself, with things
like this, if one person has it,

26:48.130 --> 26:51.960
- then it's just a matter of time until the whole thing ex...
- Kevin...

26:52.060 --> 26:55.800
You are making this so much
harder than it needs to be.

26:56.440 --> 26:57.320
Okay, fine.

26:57.450 --> 27:00.310
I was on the phone with a blogger who was
gleefully going on about your heart attack

27:00.420 --> 27:01.830
Kevin.

27:04.220 --> 27:05.910
I was trying to protect you. I'm sorry.

27:06.010 --> 27:06.990
I thought that was my job.

27:07.100 --> 27:09.170
Your job is to stay on message.

27:09.270 --> 27:10.720
This campaign has an identity.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.350
It is supposed to be about something.

27:12.450 --> 27:14.400
I was very clear how I felt about that.

27:14.490 --> 27:15.690
But you didn't tell me not to do it.

27:15.780 --> 27:19.120
You were very high minded and
noble, but you didn't say that.

27:19.210 --> 27:20.700
You left a window wide open for me.

27:20.810 --> 27:21.580
I mean, come on.

27:21.700 --> 27:24.730
Travis took it upon himself to play "hardball"?

27:24.840 --> 27:26.340
You were practically asking me to do it.

27:26.440 --> 27:29.400
All right, even if that were true, and
my impulse control was that far off,

27:29.500 --> 27:30.820
I look to you to be my compass.

27:30.920 --> 27:32.120
I need you to pull me back.

27:32.230 --> 27:34.260
I need to be able to trust that.

27:34.330 --> 27:37.660
Okay, you guys need to stop.

27:37.750 --> 27:39.430
- No, we're just we're just in the middle of something.
- No, no, no. I'm sorry.

27:39.530 --> 27:41.120
But, Kevin, you... you have to leave.

27:41.230 --> 27:42.210
- No, he doesn't.
- Yes, he does.

27:42.320 --> 27:43.590
- No, Kevin. Stay.
- No, Kevin. Go.

27:43.690 --> 27:46.280
Well, this is now turning
into my worst nightmare.

27:46.400 --> 27:47.920
Sister trumps boss.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.230
You have to go.

27:50.020 --> 27:50.870
Go.

27:51.370 --> 27:53.110
- You sure?
- Fine.

27:54.600 --> 27:55.530
Sorry.

27:58.710 --> 27:59.680
Are you.

28:00.650 --> 28:02.220
What the hell are you doing?

28:02.350 --> 28:03.390
I need ten minutes with him.

28:03.490 --> 28:05.420
I am in the middle of a crisis.

28:05.500 --> 28:06.750
I have cancer.

28:09.740 --> 28:11.090
I have lymphoma.

28:11.190 --> 28:15.600
It's the bad kind. Diffuse large B-cell.

28:15.920 --> 28:19.790
- What doctor have you...
- I have been to the oncologist twice.

28:19.900 --> 28:21.910
And I have a...

28:22.390 --> 28:24.820
a bone marrow biopsy
scheduled for tomorrow.

28:24.930 --> 28:28.190
- Okay, come and sit down.
- No, no, I... I don't.

28:28.560 --> 28:31.200
I don't want to sit down.

28:31.320 --> 28:32.300
We just need to talk about this.

28:32.410 --> 28:34.010
I don't want to talk.

28:35.700 --> 28:37.640
I don't want to talk.

28:46.030 --> 28:48.490
Rebecca, where are the financials?

28:48.610 --> 28:49.410
I put them in your desk.

28:49.520 --> 28:51.260
Well, they're not there.

28:51.380 --> 28:52.920
I'm sure I put them there. Did you move them?

28:53.020 --> 28:56.130
How could I move them if you didn't
put them back in the first place?

28:56.230 --> 28:57.530
Okay, well, do you have another copy?

28:57.640 --> 28:58.310
No, no, Rebecca.

28:58.420 --> 29:00.610
We don't have another copy.

29:00.720 --> 29:04.300
That document is our account
numbers, it lists all our assets,

29:04.410 --> 29:08.250
everything that we've had to scramble
around thanks to Tommy's mess.

29:08.350 --> 29:09.850
Oh, they're right here.

29:10.440 --> 29:11.230
Oh, thank God.

29:11.430 --> 29:13.060
That's so weird. I'm sure I put them in there.

29:13.160 --> 29:13.740
I... I'm sorry.

29:13.860 --> 29:15.930
I just I have so much stress.

29:16.020 --> 29:18.040
Things have gotten so rough around here.

29:18.140 --> 29:20.420
I... I'm sorry if I snapped at you.

29:20.530 --> 29:21.210
No, no, it's fine.

29:21.330 --> 29:23.710
I don't want any special treatment.

29:23.800 --> 29:26.230
I hope that's not why you chose my pitch.

29:26.340 --> 29:26.970
What?

29:27.080 --> 29:28.310
'Cause I'm your daughter?

29:28.390 --> 29:29.370
No, Rebecca.

29:29.470 --> 29:30.930
I wouldn't do that.

29:31.040 --> 29:35.420
I chose your idea because
your idea was the best idea.

29:36.450 --> 29:38.410
You earned it.

29:39.340 --> 29:40.630
Thank you.

29:40.980 --> 29:41.750
I gotta go.

29:41.870 --> 29:42.860
Where are you going?

29:43.000 --> 29:44.060
Back to work.

29:52.270 --> 29:53.610
Uh, I'm sorry I'm late.

29:53.740 --> 29:56.470
- But the traffic was...
- Did you bring what I asked for?

29:56.580 --> 29:57.520
Uh, yeah.

29:58.650 --> 30:01.120
I made the copies like you said.

30:02.270 --> 30:03.690
Oh, and I don't know if this matters or not,

30:03.800 --> 30:08.980
but I know they're gonna start making cheap wine
and buying bulk juice from other vineyards.

30:09.070 --> 30:10.580
Yeah, it matters.

30:13.060 --> 30:16.250
How long did you know William Walker?

30:17.590 --> 30:19.240
A long time.

30:20.190 --> 30:22.780
What'd you say you needed those for again?

30:23.160 --> 30:24.090
You have your reasons.

30:24.220 --> 30:25.360
I have mine.

30:31.920 --> 30:33.310
I was still reading that.

30:33.520 --> 30:34.420
Okay.

30:34.830 --> 30:36.150
I'm still drinking that.

30:36.520 --> 30:38.640
Please. This has to stop, okay?

30:38.740 --> 30:39.420
You're still mad.

30:39.520 --> 30:40.080
I get it.

30:40.210 --> 30:43.600
No, I'm thirsty and I haven't finished
reading the newspaper.

30:43.700 --> 30:46.650
I... I shouldn't have left you at mom's.

30:46.750 --> 30:49.430
I'm sorry. Look, why don't I
just, I'll... I'll pay the cab fare.

30:49.540 --> 30:50.440
Call it retribution.

30:50.550 --> 30:51.840
It's not about the cab, Kevin.

30:51.940 --> 30:54.840
I'm not gonna force babies
on you ever again okay?

30:54.940 --> 30:56.720
I'm not gonna force anything on anybody.

30:56.810 --> 30:59.560
You should've heard Robert last night.

30:59.690 --> 31:02.570
I'll be lucky if I still have a job when I go in today.

31:02.810 --> 31:04.430
You're always going to have a job, Kevin.

31:04.540 --> 31:05.870
You live for it.

31:07.610 --> 31:14.310
And you say you want a baby, and I'm sure you do,
but who's gonna be at home to look after it?

31:14.410 --> 31:15.410
I mean.

31:15.800 --> 31:17.940
I have a life, too, and it may
not be as important as yours,

31:18.040 --> 31:19.320
it may not be in the newspaper every day,

31:19.420 --> 31:21.990
but I like what I do, and I'm not
sure I'm ready to give that up yet.

31:22.090 --> 31:23.250
I'm... I'm not asking you to.

31:23.350 --> 31:24.400
Yes, you are.

31:24.510 --> 31:26.280
By the way you live your life, you are.

31:26.380 --> 31:27.230
I mean, look at your hours.

31:27.350 --> 31:31.210
The campaign has barely even started, and what
happens when you're on the road campaigning?

31:31.330 --> 31:32.610
We can get a nanny.

31:32.730 --> 31:35.850
That still doesn't change the fact
that you're never gonna be around.

31:36.360 --> 31:38.640
I'm not gonna be an absent father.

31:39.000 --> 31:39.900
I grew up with one.

31:40.020 --> 31:42.980
That's not what I want for my child.

31:43.990 --> 31:45.190
Okay.

31:45.680 --> 31:48.020
Then promise me if things get
crazy, you'll quit your job.

31:48.120 --> 31:49.610
Promise me that.

31:53.450 --> 31:55.670
I can't do that.

31:59.230 --> 32:04.980
But what I can do is try to prove to you...

32:05.110 --> 32:06.760
as much as possible that.

32:06.880 --> 32:14.930
I will try my best to do what's right what...
whatever that is for us and for our kid.

32:15.050 --> 32:18.950
Every family has these doubts, but...

32:19.240 --> 32:21.860
you just have to make a leap of faith.

32:23.220 --> 32:26.430
I just want to make sure we leap together.

32:27.910 --> 32:29.260
We will.

32:29.390 --> 32:31.100
I promise.

32:34.240 --> 32:37.390
The cab cost $32. 50.

32:37.520 --> 32:42.710
But...  I know how you can pay me back.

32:43.520 --> 32:46.970
So... does this mean you're
in love with me again?

32:47.060 --> 32:49.940
I never stopped loving you, Kevin.

32:58.740 --> 33:00.140
Kitty.

33:07.260 --> 33:09.300
- Can I get you anything?
- No, no.

33:09.410 --> 33:14.960
I am not supposed to eat or drink anything for
12 hours before my bone marrow biopsy.

33:15.090 --> 33:16.130
Okay.

33:16.320 --> 33:17.360
I'll be right in here.

33:17.460 --> 33:18.060
Okay.

33:18.260 --> 33:24.260
Robert, I... I think I'm ready to talk.

33:24.500 --> 33:25.350
Oh, honey.

33:25.490 --> 33:26.610
No, I know.

33:26.730 --> 33:28.430
No, I don't think you do.

33:30.120 --> 33:32.820
And even if you do, I need to say it.

33:34.800 --> 33:39.560
We are going to fight this, and we are
going to go wherever we have to go,

33:39.680 --> 33:43.970
see whoever we have to see,
and we are gonna win.

33:44.080 --> 33:47.270
'Cause I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

33:49.380 --> 33:52.160
I just can't believe that you've been
carrying all this around inside of you.

33:52.280 --> 33:53.690
Why didn't you tell me?

33:55.710 --> 33:56.670
I know. I know.

33:56.790 --> 33:58.690
I think I was just...

33:58.800 --> 33:59.940
scared.

34:00.040 --> 34:01.900
But why?

34:02.350 --> 34:03.860
Because I....

34:03.990 --> 34:07.970
was afraid that you wouldn't
be there for me.

34:08.080 --> 34:10.239
Of course I'm here for you.

34:10.370 --> 34:11.510
Well.

34:12.540 --> 34:15.480
Maybe I was afraid of that, too.

34:15.560 --> 34:17.800
I... I don't understand.

34:19.850 --> 34:21.270
Well.

34:22.909 --> 34:26.650
What if you're only here
because I have cancer?

34:31.790 --> 34:33.920
- I am here because I love you.
- Oh, God.

34:34.070 --> 34:35.679
I want to believe that.

34:36.449 --> 34:39.949
I so want to believe that. I do.

34:40.070 --> 34:41.360
I do.

34:51.050 --> 34:52.870
Look how cute you are.

34:52.889 --> 34:54.300
Hey, how are you?

34:54.409 --> 34:55.699
I'm good.

34:55.840 --> 34:59.350
Just, uh, taking a break, finally.

34:59.450 --> 35:01.250
Well, I am not.

35:01.390 --> 35:02.960
Ooh, you're not?

35:04.800 --> 35:07.350
What? I finally have more to do around here.

35:07.470 --> 35:09.010
I asked my mom for more work.

35:09.110 --> 35:10.770
And guess what.

35:10.880 --> 35:11.450
I got it.

35:11.590 --> 35:12.660
Well, that's... that's great.

35:12.780 --> 35:13.900
What do I get?

35:14.030 --> 35:14.950
You get to wait.

35:15.060 --> 35:16.340
- To wait?
- Yes.

35:16.450 --> 35:18.430
But I can't wait.

35:18.610 --> 35:19.940
Sorry. It's freaky Friday.

35:20.040 --> 35:22.030
I love freaky Fridays.

35:23.050 --> 35:24.700
Okay, fine. But I have to get this done.

35:24.800 --> 35:26.240
I can't just fall asleep after.

35:26.340 --> 35:27.940
I would never ask you to do that.

35:28.040 --> 35:29.170
I'm probably gonna fall asleep after.

35:29.310 --> 35:30.910
I'll tell you that right now.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.600
I'm only here because the Governor made me come.

35:33.750 --> 35:35.330
So say it.

35:36.610 --> 35:38.530
You have to.

35:40.300 --> 35:41.220
I went behind her back.

35:41.330 --> 35:43.070
She had nothing to do with the leak.

35:44.360 --> 35:46.120
And?

35:53.480 --> 35:55.090
I'm sorry.

35:55.900 --> 35:57.120
All right.

35:59.710 --> 36:01.490
Now it's your turn.

36:03.630 --> 36:05.870
Well, yeah, well, yeah, well, I'm yeah, I'm sorry.

36:05.990 --> 36:06.870
No, no. Not good enough.

36:06.990 --> 36:09.490
Say it louder.

36:13.950 --> 36:16.890
It was, uh.

36:16.990 --> 36:19.560
Yeah, it was... it was my idea to....

36:19.790 --> 36:24.300
leak your boss' affair, and I'm sorry.

36:26.750 --> 36:30.620
You know, you do realize, when this is
all over, we could be very good friends?

36:30.740 --> 36:32.810
We're cut from the same cloth.

36:33.310 --> 36:34.740
And what is that?

36:35.040 --> 36:37.560
Oh, cynical, meretricious, mercenary...

36:37.850 --> 36:38.860
God. You're killing me.

36:38.970 --> 36:40.340
Travis.

36:41.170 --> 36:43.010
Do I have something to worry about?

36:43.140 --> 36:44.480
Nope. Just paying my respects.

36:44.600 --> 36:48.050
It, uh, still looks good around here.

36:48.130 --> 36:48.750
Goodbye.

36:48.870 --> 36:49.920
Goodbye.

36:52.800 --> 36:53.570
What's going on?

36:53.690 --> 36:58.020
D... do you think I'm like him?

36:58.140 --> 36:59.210
I don't know.

36:59.330 --> 37:00.300
Maybe.

37:00.740 --> 37:02.190
I mean, I don't know.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.100
You and I have different jobs.

37:04.210 --> 37:08.330
You were trying to protect me, and for the
record, if somebody was coming after you,

37:08.440 --> 37:09.350
I'd rip their head off.

37:09.450 --> 37:10.980
I'd have done the same thing.

37:11.300 --> 37:13.880
Great. Uh, you have a television interview,

37:14.000 --> 37:15.270
so we should probably head over there.

37:15.370 --> 37:16.290
I'm just gonna go alone.

37:16.400 --> 37:17.860
You... you want me to stay here?

37:17.980 --> 37:19.690
Yeah. I got it.

37:19.800 --> 37:21.850
We're... we are good, right?

37:21.970 --> 37:22.830
Yeah.

37:23.280 --> 37:24.570
We're good.

37:29.210 --> 37:34.770
As you now know, I did have a
heart attack a few months ago.

37:34.900 --> 37:38.760
Ironically, it was the same
day that my son was born.

37:38.900 --> 37:45.120
And, uh, how my wife Kitty
managed that day, I'll never know.

37:46.360 --> 37:47.880
Dr. Avadon should be right in.

37:47.990 --> 37:48.900
Okay.

37:49.170 --> 37:52.300
Kitty was completely there for me and Evan.

37:52.420 --> 37:53.400
Here's a gown for you to put on.

37:53.500 --> 37:56.060
And, uh, let me tell you something, I was scared.

37:56.190 --> 38:01.390
You know, to face your
own mortality is frightening.

38:09.420 --> 38:10.370
How you doing?

38:10.580 --> 38:11.750
I'm good as...

38:11.850 --> 38:14.150
as long as I don't look over there.

38:14.330 --> 38:15.130
Well, you know what?

38:15.250 --> 38:17.640
Why don't you look right here?

38:17.970 --> 38:18.840
Oh, my God.

38:18.980 --> 38:21.440
- Is that a banana nut?
- It is.

38:21.560 --> 38:25.740
And the minute this is all over with, it's all yours.

38:27.560 --> 38:28.530
Okay.

38:28.970 --> 38:30.870
Let's get you guys out of here.

38:30.990 --> 38:32.240
Okay...

38:34.450 --> 38:39.400
so if I misled the people of
California, I also misled myself.

38:39.520 --> 38:41.290
I'm not proud of it.

38:41.390 --> 38:47.520
But I think that it takes time before
you can talk about something like this.

38:47.630 --> 38:49.540
You're gonna feel a little pressure.

38:50.700 --> 38:52.740
You need to find the courage.

38:55.020 --> 38:58.930
And when you do talk, you realize.

38:59.050 --> 39:05.980
The most amazing thing that what's
happening, as... as horrible as it is.

39:06.100 --> 39:10.190
Is bringing you closer to the people that you love.

39:10.500 --> 39:15.520
It's reminding you of what's most true in your life.

39:17.600 --> 39:19.830
And that is a good thing.

39:19.940 --> 39:21.480
All done.

39:24.700 --> 39:27.780
No matter how it happens.

39:38.550 --> 39:40.130
Nora?

39:41.610 --> 39:43.520
Nora, what are you doing here?

39:43.640 --> 39:46.360
I dropped Evan off early this morning,
and I thought I'd come find you.

39:46.460 --> 39:47.860
I know you walk here every day.

39:47.960 --> 39:51.550
So if you came here to apologize, Nora,
you didn't have to come this far.

39:51.670 --> 39:53.430
You could've just called me on the phone.

39:53.530 --> 39:55.330
I wanted to do it in person.

39:55.420 --> 39:56.100
Thank you.

39:56.210 --> 39:57.600
Apology accepted.

39:59.220 --> 40:01.500
My God, it's beautiful here.

40:03.080 --> 40:04.370
Maybe I should.

40:04.480 --> 40:07.410
Walk with you every day, and it would make me.

40:07.540 --> 40:09.650
Strong and calm.

40:09.740 --> 40:10.750
That would be good.

40:10.860 --> 40:12.850
I could use the company.

40:14.790 --> 40:17.770
I'm so tired of.

40:18.170 --> 40:21.160
trying to make sure everybody does the right thing.

40:21.280 --> 40:23.440
I don't know what the right thing is myself.

40:23.560 --> 40:25.640
By everybody, what are you
talking about, the children?

40:25.750 --> 40:28.140
Yes. Why do I have to have
the answers all the time?

40:28.240 --> 40:29.320
I don't have the answers.

40:29.430 --> 40:30.460
I can't be calm.

40:30.560 --> 40:31.180
I can't be strong.

40:31.310 --> 40:32.370
Nora, you don't have to be calm.

40:32.480 --> 40:33.370
You don't have to be strong.

40:33.480 --> 40:34.570
Come on.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.990
- Kitty's sick.
- What?

40:37.120 --> 40:39.170
What do you mean, "sick"?W hat kind of sick?

40:39.300 --> 40:41.380
Oh, she doesn't want me to tell you this.

40:41.490 --> 40:43.340
- I shouldn't be saying anything.
- Nora, tell me.

40:43.450 --> 40:45.500
I'm your brother. It's me.

40:47.850 --> 40:49.340
It's cancer.

40:49.460 --> 40:51.550
- She's got cancer.
- Oh, God.

40:51.670 --> 40:53.050
It should be me, Saul.

40:53.170 --> 40:54.110
It should be me.

40:54.250 --> 40:55.010
I'm old.

40:55.170 --> 40:57.140
She's so young and she has a little baby.

40:57.330 --> 40:58.550
Is she getting treatment?

40:58.710 --> 41:00.570
- Yes. - Good.

41:01.190 --> 41:03.380
I don't want her to have to do this.

41:03.610 --> 41:06.160
I don't want her to have to do this.

41:06.300 --> 41:07.680
I don't want her to have to do this.

41:07.880 --> 41:09.200
Oh, it's okay.

41:11.320 --> 41:13.330
It's okay. It's okay.
