00:04.470 --> 00:07.189
- SIR.

00:07.240 --> 00:09.299
- HENRY,
YOU SCREWED UP.

00:09.340 --> 00:11.467
- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, CHIEF,
I GOT THE GUY.

00:11.510 --> 00:13.398
- HE HAD A PARTNER.
- AND I'LL GET HIM TOO.

00:13.440 --> 00:16.546
- YOU'RE A DETECTIVE NOW.
STAKES ARE HIGHER.

00:16.580 --> 00:18.070
I'M NOT HERE TO RIDE YOU.

00:18.110 --> 00:19.418
YOU MADE A MISTAKE.

00:19.450 --> 00:21.111
DON'T DO IT NEXT TIME.

00:21.150 --> 00:23.186
- I'LL WORK OVERTIME, SIR.
I'LL FIX THIS.

00:23.220 --> 00:24.016
- NO, YOU WON'T.

00:24.050 --> 00:24.982
I GAVE THE CASE
TO PETERS AND BOONE.

00:25.020 --> 00:26.612
- I GET THAT,
THEY'RE THE BEST WE'VE GOT,

00:26.660 --> 00:28.116
BUT, SIR, BELIEVE ME,
I CAN TAKE--

00:28.160 --> 00:30.822
- YOU CAN LEAVE NOW.

00:30.860 --> 00:32.748
- YES, SIR.

00:46.180 --> 00:48.068
[loud creaking, footsteps]

00:51.150 --> 00:53.209

SOME SHADY PEOPLE IN MY DAY,

00:53.250 --> 00:55.377
BUT YOU TWO,
YOU MIGHT JUST BE

00:55.420 --> 00:57.285
THE WORST OF THE WORST.

00:57.320 --> 00:59.117
OKAY.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.151
YOU COME AND GET ME.

01:01.190 --> 01:03.750
I'LL SQUEEZE THE COWARD
OUT OF THE BOTH OF YOU.

01:03.790 --> 01:06.327
[approaching footsteps,

01:12.240 --> 01:14.231
- WHAT IS TODAY,
CASUAL FRIDAY?

01:14.270 --> 01:16.158
- NO, SHAWN,
IT'S MY DAY OFF.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.529
THE CHIEF WANTED ALL
LIVING BODIES ON HAND.

01:17.570 --> 01:20.403
YOU KNOW WHO THE VICTIM IS,
DON'T YOU?

01:20.440 --> 01:22.249
- SANTA BARBARA'S
OLDEST LOBSTERMAN?

01:22.280 --> 01:25.169
- NO, SHAWN.
HERB WILKINS.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.644
HE'S THE BEST CHIEF
THIS DEPARTMENT'S EVER HAD,

01:27.680 --> 01:28.749
AND MY BOSS
FOR OVER 20 YEARS.

01:28.780 --> 01:31.146
- WELL, HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS,
LOOKS LIKE HE LIVED

01:31.190 --> 01:33.249
EIGHT OR NINE DECADES
BEFORE HE MET HIS MAKER.

01:33.290 --> 01:34.484
- I'M GONNA ASK YOU
TO BE RESPECTFUL HERE.

01:34.520 --> 01:37.182
- I WILL POLITELY DECLINE.

01:37.230 --> 01:39.221
COME ON, DAD,
I'M KIDDING.

01:39.260 --> 01:40.522
ALL RIGHT, I GET IT.

01:40.560 --> 01:42.562
[horn honks]

01:48.240 --> 01:49.161
WHO ARE THE OLD GUYS?

01:49.210 --> 01:52.134
- BOONE AND PETERS,
VETERANS OF THE SBPD.

01:52.180 --> 01:54.239
WORKED UNDER HERB
FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.599
VOLUNTEERS NOWADAYS.

01:55.640 --> 01:57.141
THESE GUYS ARE LEGENDS.

01:57.180 --> 01:58.204
- SO ARE LEPRECHAUNS,
BUT YOU DON'T SEE THEM

01:58.250 --> 01:59.217
ROLLING OUT CRIME TAPE.

01:59.250 --> 02:01.343
- YOU GUYS WISH YOU HAD
1/10 OF THE KNOWLEDGE

02:01.380 --> 02:03.712
THESE GUYS CURRENTLY HAVE.

02:03.750 --> 02:05.183
HEY, BUDDY.
- HENRY.

02:05.220 --> 02:08.519
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

02:08.560 --> 02:10.721
- OH, COME ON.

02:10.760 --> 02:12.398
DAD, THESE GUYS ARE RETIRED.

02:12.430 --> 02:13.226
THE ONLY THING THEY DO NOW

02:13.260 --> 02:14.750
IS KEEP MINORS
FROM DOING WHIP-ITS

02:14.800 --> 02:15.892
AT THE 7-ELEVEN.

02:15.930 --> 02:17.295
- THESE GUYS KNEW HERB

02:17.330 --> 02:18.297
BETTER THAN ANYONE
ON THE PLANET.

02:18.330 --> 02:19.729
QUIT BEING A WISE-ASS,

02:19.770 --> 02:21.635
YOU TWO MIGHT
LEARN SOMETHING HERE.

02:23.840 --> 02:25.307
- THE ONLY THING
I'M GONNA LEARN FROM THOSE TWO

02:25.340 --> 02:27.479
IS WHAT TIME
THE HOMETOWN BUFFET CLOSES.

02:27.510 --> 02:30.399
- IT CLOSES AT 8:00.

02:30.450 --> 02:32.213
WHAT?

02:32.250 --> 02:33.717
IT CLOSES AT 8:00, SHAWN.

02:33.750 --> 02:36.184
- AS MANY OF YOU NOW KNOW,

02:36.220 --> 02:37.539
THE DECEASED IS HERB WILKINS.

02:37.590 --> 02:40.252
HE WAS SBPD'S
POLICE CHIEF FOR 20 YEARS,

02:40.290 --> 02:42.178
AND WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT THIS IS YET,

02:42.230 --> 02:44.221
BUT HERB'S LEGACY
IS TO BE PROTECTED.

02:45.960 --> 02:48.428
- LOOKS LIKE THE POOR GUY
OFFED HIMSELF.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.599
- HE DEFINITELY DID NOT
OFF HIMSELF.

02:50.630 --> 02:52.769
I'M HAVING A CLEAR VISION

02:52.800 --> 02:54.290
ON A CLOUDY DAY.

02:54.340 --> 02:55.898
HERB WILKINS DID NOT...

02:55.940 --> 02:58.966
- KILL HIMSELF.

02:59.010 --> 03:02.798
- THANK YOU,
MR. PETERS, IS IT?

03:02.850 --> 03:04.477
IF IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU,
I'D LIKE TO CONTINUE.

03:04.510 --> 03:05.875

03:05.910 --> 03:07.514
I AM THE PSYCHIC DETECTIVE
FOR TH E--

03:07.550 --> 03:08.619
- PSYCHIC?

03:08.650 --> 03:11.244
SON, WE DON'T MESS
WITH THE DEVIL.

03:11.290 --> 03:13.679
YOU BE'I'I'ER RIDE THAT GOAT
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

03:13.720 --> 03:14.948
- THE DEVIL.

03:14.990 --> 03:16.014
REALLY?

03:16.060 --> 03:18.620
ALL RIGHT, WELL, HOW ELSE
WOULD I KNOW THAT HE--

03:18.660 --> 03:19.752
- WAS WRAPPED UP
IN DUCT TAPE.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.358
WHICH EXPLAINS WHY

03:21.400 --> 03:24.824
HE'S MISSING HAIR
ON HIS WRIST.

03:24.870 --> 03:28.237
- SIR, I AM DOING MY BEST

03:28.270 --> 03:30.409
TO RESPECT YOUR LEGACY
AND YOUR WISDOM,

03:30.440 --> 03:33.273
THE MANY WORLD AND CIVIL WARS
THAT YOU'VE BOTH SEEN

03:33.310 --> 03:34.208
AND PERHAPS FOUGHT IN.

03:34.240 --> 03:36.549
- AND HERB WAS NOT KILLED
ON THIS BOAT.

03:36.580 --> 03:40.016
- CHIEF, I CAN TELL YOU
DEFINITIVELY

03:40.050 --> 03:41.938
HERB DID NOT DIE
ON THIS BOAT.

03:41.980 --> 03:43.880
- NOPE, NOT ON THIS BOAT.

03:43.920 --> 03:44.818
NOWHERE NEAR THIS BOAT.

03:44.850 --> 03:48.456
- HE WAS KILLED IN ANOTHER
LOCATION T.B.S.

03:48.490 --> 03:50.378
- IT'S "T.B.D.," SHAWN.

03:50.430 --> 03:52.819
- WHAT'S "T.B.S."?
- THAT'S THE SUPERSTATION.

03:52.860 --> 03:53.952
- IS IT REALLY THOUGH?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.854
- THIS IS EMBARRASSING.
- DON'T WORRY.

03:55.900 --> 03:57.527
HE HASN'T SAID ANYTHING
I DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.697
MY THEORY
WILL BE PROVEN CORRECT

03:59.740 --> 04:02.800
AFTER A QUICK INSPECTION
OF HERB'S GUN.

04:02.840 --> 04:04.831
- ONE PROBLEM THERE,
RICKY NELSON.

04:04.870 --> 04:06.428
THIS IS NOT HERB'S GUN.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.333
- AND YOU KNOW THAT HOW?

04:07.380 --> 04:09.541
- BECAUSE HERB WENT TO BED
EVERY NIGHT

04:09.580 --> 04:11.002
WITH HIS FAVORITE SIX-SHOOTER.

04:11.050 --> 04:13.268
- AND HE NAMED IT
"DARLA SAIDMAN."

04:13.320 --> 04:14.617
- HIS GUN WAS JEWISH?

04:14.650 --> 04:15.674
- AND HERB WOULDN'T BE CAUGHT

04:15.720 --> 04:17.938
HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH A BERE'I'I'A.

04:17.990 --> 04:20.618
- YOU KNOW,
I NEVER NAMED MY GUN.

04:20.660 --> 04:22.287
HOW 'BOUT "MR. THUNDERSTICK"?

04:22.330 --> 04:24.981
- THIS BERE'I'I'A WAS PLACED
ON THE DECK BY THE KILLER.

04:25.030 --> 04:26.793
- AND THE SERIAL NUMBER'S
FILED OFF.

04:26.830 --> 04:28.058
- WHICH MAKES IT UNTRACEABLE.

04:28.100 --> 04:29.397
- SEE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?

04:29.430 --> 04:31.295
- IT'S A NICE SUGGESTION,
MR. SPENCER.

04:31.330 --> 04:32.592
- OH, I HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING YET, CHIEF.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.437
- NO, I WAS SPEAKING
OF YOUR FATHER SUGGESTING

04:34.470 --> 04:36.631
THAT WE BRING DOWN
PETERS AND BOONE.

04:36.670 --> 04:38.729
- ALL RIGHT,
LISTEN UP, FOLKS.

04:38.770 --> 04:40.874
I WILL FIND THIS COP KILLER.

04:40.910 --> 04:42.571
- WRONG AGAIN, RICK.

04:42.610 --> 04:44.908
HERB WAS CARRIED
ON THIS BOAT,

04:44.950 --> 04:48.010
ONE PERSON UNDER THE ARMS,
ONE PERSON ON THE FEET,

04:48.050 --> 04:51.941
WHICH MEANS WE ARE LOOKING FOR
TWO COP KILLERS.

- YOU'RE EYEBALLING MY WATCH.

07:40.860 --> 07:42.213
- IT'S A CASIO.

- YOU JUST PROVED MY POINT,
SLICK FINGERS.

07:44.990 --> 07:46.958
- CAN WE FOCUS, PLEASE?

07:47.000 --> 07:49.491
OKAY, WHAT DO WE HAVE SO FAR?

07:49.530 --> 07:51.088
- WELL, WE'RE WORKING ON
GETTING ACCESS TO HERB'S HOUSE.

07:51.130 --> 07:52.995
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET IN
THERE BY LATE THIS AFTERNOON.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.564
WE SENT THE PRINTS
PULLED FROM THE CRIME SCENE

07:54.600 --> 07:55.828
TO THE LAB FOR PROCESSING.

07:55.870 --> 07:56.939
- AND WE SPOKE TO
HERB'S DAUGHTER, CAROLINE.

SHE'S FLYING IN FROM AUSTIN
TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.499
THEY HAVEN'T SPOKEN IN YEARS,
SO I DON'T THINK

08:00.540 --> 08:02.178
SHE'S GONNA BE MUCH HELP
TO THE CASE.

08:02.210 --> 08:03.973
- WHAT?

08:04.010 --> 08:06.001
- DO YOU REALIZE THAT ALL
PETERS AND BOONE DO NOW

08:06.050 --> 08:08.245
IS PLAY CHECKERS AT THE PARK
WITH OTHER RETIRED COPS?

08:08.280 --> 08:09.679
- THESE GUYS
ARE STILL THE BEST.

08:09.720 --> 08:11.039
YOU SAW THE WORK THEY DID
DOWN AT THE DOCKS.

08:11.090 --> 08:12.045
- IT'S CALLED LUCK.

08:12.090 --> 08:13.819
- SHAWN, A GOOD COP'S
INSTINCTS NEVER GO AWAY.

08:13.860 --> 08:15.009
- LOOK, IT IS YOUR FAULT
THAT THEY ARE STOM PING

08:15.060 --> 08:17.927
ALL OVER MY TURF WITH THEIR
DOUBLE-VELCRO EASY STEPPERS.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.099
WHEN A COP RETIRES,
HE SHOULD STAY RETIRED.

08:20.130 --> 08:21.097
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,

08:21.130 --> 08:22.688
THAT I SHOULD HAVE NEVER
COME OUT OF RETIREMENT?

08:22.730 --> 08:25.597
- I AM SAYING
THAT IT IS TIME

08:25.630 --> 08:27.268
FOR YOU TO TAKE OFF
THE '705 GOGGLES

08:27.300 --> 08:28.836
AND SEE THAT THE WORLD,
THE ENTIRE WORLD,

08:28.870 --> 08:31.304
HAS PASSED THOSE GUYS BY.

08:31.340 --> 08:33.205
- I'M SORRY TO HEAR
THAT YOU FEEL THAT WAY

08:33.240 --> 08:34.537
ABOUT MY COMING BACK TO WORK.

08:34.580 --> 08:36.309
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- OH, GOD.

08:36.340 --> 08:37.978
- WE'RE HEADING FOR HERB'S
LIVE BAIT SHOP,

08:38.010 --> 08:40.274
DIG UP SOME CLUES.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.242
- HEY, SWEETIE,
WHEN WE GET BACK,

08:42.280 --> 08:44.089
WE'RE GONNA NEED A FRESH POT
OF JOE AND A BAKER'S OF GLAZED.

08:44.120 --> 08:46.918
- FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, BOONE,
I AM A DETECTIVE.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.212
- SURE YOU ARE.

08:49.260 --> 08:52.229
- WE COULD LEAVE IN AN HOUR
AND STILL BEAT THEM TO THE DOCK

08:52.260 --> 08:53.227
BY FOUR DAYS.

08:53.260 --> 08:55.125
- YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.627
- DID YOU KNOW HERB
HAD A LIVE BAIT SHOP?

08:56.670 --> 08:59.195
- NO, I DID NOT.
- DAMN IT.

09:02.840 --> 09:06.571
[scoffs]

09:06.610 --> 09:07.338
[sighs]

09:07.380 --> 09:08.972
NOT GONNA SUGARCOAT THIS
FOR YOU.

09:09.010 --> 09:10.773
THIS IS A TOUGH MOMENT
FOR US, GUS.

09:10.810 --> 09:14.678
- YES, IT IS.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.280
- WE HAVE FRIENDS WHO SAW YOU
HAVING WORDS WITH HERB.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.083
- WELL, EVERYONE
HAD WORDS WITH HIM.

09:19.120 --> 09:20.712
WE BOUGHT BAIT
AT HIS SHOP ALL THE TIME.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.352
- WE HEARD HE DIDN'T
LOOK VERY HAPPY.

09:22.390 --> 09:24.722
- [chuckles]
HERB WAS NEVER HAPPY.

09:24.760 --> 09:27.024
HE WAS A CRANKY OLD MAN.

09:29.260 --> 09:31.091
- I THINK WE SHOULD AVOID
PETERS AND BOONE

09:31.130 --> 09:32.165
UNTIL WE HAVE
SOMETHING JUICY.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.361
- THEN THROW OUR SOMETHING
JUICY IN THEIR FACES.

09:34.400 --> 09:35.833
- YEAH, LIKE ROTTEN PEACHES.

09:35.870 --> 09:37.861
- WHAT? WHERE ARE WE GONNA
GET PEACHES?

09:37.910 --> 09:39.332
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I REALLY LIKE THAT IDEA.

09:39.370 --> 09:41.702
- ME TOO, BUT I THINK
WE SHOULD GET FRESH PEACHES

09:41.740 --> 09:42.946
AND EAT THEM INSTEAD.

09:42.980 --> 09:45.244
- RIGHT IN FIEO-INT OF THEM.

09:59.290 --> 10:01.690
- HOW 'BOUT A CHURRO?

10:01.730 --> 10:02.958
HELLO, MA'AM.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.399
MY NAME IS SHAWN SPENCER.

10:04.430 --> 10:06.227
THIS IS MY PARTNER, IMHOTEP,

10:06.270 --> 10:07.862
OR "HE COMETH IN PEACE."

10:07.900 --> 10:11.063
GO AHEAD, SHOW HER YOUR
"COMETH IN PEACE" FACE.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.236
WE'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS

10:12.270 --> 10:13.407
ABOUT ONE OF YOUR
FELLOW WHARF-MATES.

10:13.440 --> 10:14.668
- YEAH, I HEARD ABOUT HERB.

10:14.710 --> 10:16.075
IT'S SO SAD.

10:16.110 --> 10:17.338
- DID HE HAVE ANY ENEMIES
THAT YOU KNOW OF?

10:17.380 --> 10:18.404
- NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

10:18.450 --> 10:19.303
- HOW 'BOUT "FRENEMIES"?

10:19.350 --> 10:20.817
"PRETENEMIES"?

10:20.850 --> 10:23.045
HOW 'BOUT "PALHOLES"?

10:23.090 --> 10:24.739
- HERB WAS PRETTY TOUGH,

10:24.790 --> 10:26.189
BUT EVERYBODY RESPECT ED HIM.

10:26.220 --> 10:28.381
- SO YOU CAN'T THINK
OF ANYTHING UNUSUAL

10:28.420 --> 10:31.184
THAT WAS GOING ON?

10:31.230 --> 10:33.698
- THERE WAS ONE THING
I FOUND ODD.

10:33.730 --> 10:36.893
HE WAS SPENDING A LOT OF QUALITY
TIME WITH A YOUNG GIRL.

10:36.930 --> 10:38.363
- IS THAT RIGHT?

10:38.400 --> 10:39.992
- WHAT CAN YOU TELL US
ABOUT THAT LITTLE HARLOT?

10:40.040 --> 10:41.291
- NOT MUCH.

10:41.340 --> 10:43.262
LONG RED HAIR,
ABOUT 20 YEARS OLD.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.403
CAN'T REMEMBER HER NAME.

10:45.440 --> 10:46.930
SAMANTHA MAYBE.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.277
SHE WORKS AT THE PACIFIC
TREASURES SHOP OVER THERE.

10:48.310 --> 10:49.743
- RIGHT OVER HERE?

10:49.780 --> 10:51.338
- OH, THANK YOU.
WE'LL TALK TO HER.

10:51.380 --> 10:52.870
- YOU WON'T FIND HER THERE.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.717
SHE HASN'T OPENED HER SHOP
THE PAST FEW DAYS.

10:54.750 --> 10:57.082
both: REALLY?

10:57.120 --> 10:59.315
REALLY?

11:04.460 --> 11:06.758
- OKAY, RANDY,
NOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA PLAY

11:06.800 --> 11:08.051
IS A LITTLE GAME CALLED

11:08.100 --> 11:09.419
"DAMN GOOD CHANCE
YOU'RE GETTIN' SHOT."

11:09.460 --> 11:10.859
- TUCK THE SHOOTER, FLOYD.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.390
- TUCK IT?
THIS IS HOW I DO IT, MAN.

11:12.430 --> 11:13.863
- I KNOW THIS IS HOW
YOU DO IT,

11:13.900 --> 11:16.039
BUT THIS IS NOT THE TIME
TO DO IT HOW YOU DO IT.

11:16.070 --> 11:17.230
- I AIN'T TUCKING HER
ONCE SHE'S OUT.

11:17.270 --> 11:18.407
- TUCK IT, FLOYD.

11:18.440 --> 11:19.737
- SHOULD WE STEP IN?

11:19.780 --> 11:20.906
- JUST A LITTLE TIFF, GUS.

11:20.940 --> 11:23.170
BESIDES THERE'S NO BULLETS
IN THAT GUN.

11:23.210 --> 11:24.472
- HOW SURE ARE YOU?
- ONE IN SIX CHANCE.

11:24.510 --> 11:27.070
- THOSE ARE THE EXACT ODDS,
SHAWN.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.144
- WELL, THE PALM READER

11:28.180 --> 11:30.842
AND THAT GUY WHO LOOKS LIKE
A YOUNG LAWANDA PAGE

11:30.890 --> 11:32.312
DECIDED TO JOIN US.

11:32.350 --> 11:34.181
- LAWANDA PAGE
FROM SANFORD AND SON?

11:34.220 --> 11:35.812
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT.

11:35.860 --> 11:36.884
YOU LET THAT HAIR GROW OUT,
YOU'D LOOK JUST LIKE HER.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.329
- YOU DO HAVE A LITTLE LAWANDA
IN THE EYES, GUS.

11:38.360 --> 11:39.327
- SHUT UP, SHAWN.

11:39.360 --> 11:40.327
- CAN I GO NOW?

11:40.360 --> 11:41.759
- YEAH, YOU CAN GO.

11:41.800 --> 11:44.064
HEY, I'M GONNA BE
WATCHING YOU.

11:44.100 --> 11:45.965
- ME TOO.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.035
- JUST FOR THE RECORD,

11:47.070 --> 11:48.435
I'M A PSYCHIC,
NOT A PALM READER.

11:48.470 --> 11:50.006
- WHAT YOU ARE IS 172 POUNDS,

11:50.040 --> 11:51.860
AND WE DON'T GIVE A DAMN.

11:51.910 --> 11:52.899
- HE'S GOOD.

11:52.940 --> 11:54.908
- WHILE YOU TWO GUYS
WERE PUSSYFOOTING AROUND,

11:54.940 --> 11:56.271
WE ROUNDED UP A SUSPECT.

11:56.310 --> 11:58.005
- ALL RIGHT,
JUST TO CLARIFY,

11:58.050 --> 11:59.369
GUS IS THE ONLY ONE
WHO PUSSYFOOTS.

11:59.410 --> 12:01.173
AND IN HIS DEFENSE,
HE HAS TWO BUM KNEES

12:01.220 --> 12:02.471
AND AN ACHILLES' HEEL.

12:02.520 --> 12:03.839
- TWO ACHILLES' HEELS.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.983
- REALLY?
IT'S WORSE THAN I IMAGINED.

12:06.020 --> 12:07.954
AND WE'RE ABOUT TO DROP
A HUMDINGER ON YOU FELLAS.

12:07.990 --> 12:10.527
TURNS OUT OLD HERB
WAS PLAYING ADULT PING-PONG

12:10.560 --> 12:12.528
WITH A ZOISH-YEAR-OLD GIRL
WHO WORKS RIGHT HERE

12:12.560 --> 12:13.925
ON THE WHARF.

12:13.960 --> 12:15.029
- MAYBE THEY WERE FRIENDS.

12:15.060 --> 12:17.221
- WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
THE BIFOCALS OFF, TOM LANDRY.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.022
THE MAN WAS SHOT
EXECUTION-STYLE,

12:19.070 --> 12:20.833
AND HE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH A YOUNG DAME.

12:20.870 --> 12:22.758
- A YOUNG DAME WHO DIDN'T
SHOW UP TO OPEN UP HER SHOP

12:22.810 --> 12:24.004
IN A FEW DAYS.

12:24.040 --> 12:26.975
- I WOULD THINK LONG AND HARD
BEFORE I SPOKE AGAIN, RICK.

12:27.010 --> 12:28.978
- AND YOU BETTER THINK
LONGER AND HARDER

12:29.010 --> 12:30.978
AND THEN NOT SAY SQUAT.

12:31.010 --> 12:32.546
- THAT'S A HIGH PERCENTAGE
OF THINKING TO NOT TALKING.

12:32.580 --> 12:34.912
- AH-HA, LOOKY HERE.

12:34.950 --> 12:35.848
TEXT FROM JULES.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.848
THEY GOT THE OKAY
TO SEARCH HERB'S HOUSE.

12:37.890 --> 12:39.312
THEY'LL BE THERE
IN ABOUT AN HOUR.

12:39.350 --> 12:40.988
SO I GUESS WE'LL SEE YOU
AT HERB'S HOUSE

12:41.020 --> 12:42.214
IN ABOUT AN HOUR.

12:42.260 --> 12:44.421
- SEE YA.
- WOULDN'T WANT TO BE YA.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.068
- [groaning]

12:56.100 --> 12:59.228
- ONLY 45 MINUTES
UNTIL THE SEARCH, FLOYD.

12:59.270 --> 13:00.828
- GOOD THING, DON.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.973
EARLY BIRD SPECIAL JUST AROUND
THE CORNER AT COCO'S.

13:03.010 --> 13:04.978
- [laughs]

13:07.120 --> 13:08.849
BOONE? WHAT?

13:08.880 --> 13:10.381
YOU GUYS CAN'T DO THIS.

13:10.420 --> 13:12.012
THIS IS OUR MOVE.
WE GET HERE BEFORE THE POLICE,

13:12.050 --> 13:13.153
AND WE BREAK THE RULES.

13:13.190 --> 13:16.250
- HEY, WE WERE BREAKING
THE RULES BEFORE THEY HAD RULES.

13:16.290 --> 13:18.554
- OH, SO YOU HAVE THE COPYRIGHT
ON BREAKING THE RULES?

13:18.590 --> 13:20.455
- AND WE DON'T
DISTURB THE SCENE.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.424
WE DO OUR SEARCH,
LEAVE NO TRACE.

13:23.470 --> 13:24.425
GOT IT?

13:24.470 --> 13:26.495
- YEAH, THANKS.

13:31.510 --> 13:33.569
- [sniffs]

13:33.610 --> 13:35.578
- [scoffs]

13:35.610 --> 13:37.942
PLEASE TELL ME WE DON'T LOOK
LIKE THAT WHEN WE DO OUR THING.

13:37.980 --> 13:40.073
- THAT'S EXACTLY
HOW WE LOOK.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.241
- I THINK THERE'S
A CLUE IN THAT FISH.

13:46.290 --> 13:47.552
- I THINK HE KNOWS THAT FISH.

13:47.590 --> 13:48.909
- I THINK HE THINKS THE FISH

13:48.960 --> 13:51.053
HAS INFORMATION ABOUT
HERB'S MURDER.

13:51.090 --> 13:55.094
- FLOYD AND I HELPED HERB
CATCH THAT WALLEYE, YOU GERMS.

13:55.130 --> 13:56.529
- BACK IN '82.

13:56.560 --> 13:58.289
THAT MAN COULD REEL 'EM IN
LIKE NOBODY'S BUSINESS.

13:58.330 --> 13:59.627
- HE SURE COULD, FLOYD.

13:59.670 --> 14:00.989
- "MAN COULD REEL 'EM IN
LIKE NOBODY."

14:06.540 --> 14:07.370
- OH, LOOK AT THAT.

14:07.410 --> 14:10.345
YOU AND OLD HERB
HAVE THE SAME SWIMSUIT.

14:10.380 --> 14:12.439
- I WEAR A FULL-BODY FASTSKIN
SUIT WHEN I SWIM, SHAWN.

14:12.480 --> 14:15.119
IT INCREASES MY SPEED,
ENDURANCE, AND BUOYANCY.

14:15.150 --> 14:16.617
- NO COMMENT.

14:26.930 --> 14:28.454
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GETTING SOMETHING.

14:28.500 --> 14:32.425
A MAN, OR MEN,
A WOMAN, OR WOMEN,

14:32.470 --> 14:35.530
PERHAPS PETS,
POSSIBLY FELINE,

14:35.570 --> 14:36.594
UNWELCOME IN THIS HOUSE,

14:36.640 --> 14:38.130
SEARCHING HIGH
AND POSSIBLY LOW

14:38.170 --> 14:40.138
FOR SOMETHING
THAT HERB WILKINS,

14:40.180 --> 14:43.149
A MAN OF MANY SECRETS
AND POTENTIALLY LIES,

14:43.180 --> 14:44.340
WAS HIDING.

14:44.380 --> 14:46.439
- GETTING SICK
AND TIRED OF YOU GUYS

14:46.480 --> 14:49.040
ACCUSING HERB OF MISBEHAVIOR.

14:49.080 --> 14:50.581
- I'M FEELING LIKE I NEED
MY BILLY CLUB

14:50.620 --> 14:52.019
AND SOMETHING
TO WIPE OFF PRINTS.

14:52.050 --> 14:53.415
- OKAY, CALM DOWN.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.257
MAYBE THEY'RE RIGHT.

14:55.290 --> 14:56.985
BUT I GUARANTEE YOU,

14:57.030 --> 14:58.554
WHATEVER THOSE PERPS
WERE LOOKING FOR,

14:58.590 --> 15:00.455
THEY DID NOT FIND
IN THIS HOUSE.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.649
- HEY, HERB WAS THE MOST

15:01.700 --> 15:03.065
CAREFUL, THOROUGH MAN
ON THE PLANET.

15:03.100 --> 15:04.226
IF THERE WAS
SOMETHING IMPORTANT,

15:04.270 --> 15:05.623
SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE
WERE AFTER,

15:05.670 --> 15:07.592
THERE IS NO WAY HE WOULDA
HID IT IN HIS HOME.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.096
- WELL, WHERE WOULD
HE HAVE KEPT IT?

15:09.140 --> 15:11.529
- [chuckles]

15:14.580 --> 15:16.309
- ALL RIGHT, YOU REMEMBER
BACK IN THE OLD DAYS

15:16.340 --> 15:18.672
WHEN WE HAD REALLY, REALLY
SPECIAL EVIDENCE

15:18.710 --> 15:21.076
AND WE KEPT IT
IN A SECRET LOCKER?

15:21.120 --> 15:23.088
- NO.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.382
- I'LL BET YOU

15:24.420 --> 15:26.547
WHATEVER THOSE PERPS
WERE LOOKING FOR

15:26.590 --> 15:27.955
IS IN HERB'S LOCKER.

15:27.990 --> 15:29.082
- CAN WE BE HEARD
THAT CLEARLY

15:29.120 --> 15:30.052
WHEN WE TURN AROUND
AND WHISPER?

15:30.090 --> 15:33.628
- I SURE HOPE NOT.

15:33.660 --> 15:36.458
[both laugh]

15:36.500 --> 15:38.365
- WHY DO THEY SHAKE HANDS
LIKE THAT?

15:38.400 --> 15:39.958
- I DO NOT KNOW.
- IT'S SO RIDICULOUS.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.035
- WHAT?

15:48.080 --> 15:51.072
- I KNOW WHERE
HERB'S LOCKER IS.

15:54.050 --> 15:56.143
- DUDE, WE DIDN'T SEE
THEIR CAR RIGHT THERE?

15:56.180 --> 15:58.148
- IT CLEARLY BLENDS IN
WITH THE LANDSCAPING, GUS.

15:58.190 --> 16:00.408
SHH, JUST ACT NATURAL.

16:04.090 --> 16:05.648
- YOU GUYS GONNA CONDUCT
THE SEARCH WITH US?

16:05.690 --> 16:07.191
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.
- WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT.

16:07.230 --> 16:11.269
- LATER.
- RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

16:11.300 --> 16:15.134
I AM TELLING YOU GUYS,
DO NOT FOLLOW US.

16:15.170 --> 16:16.592
- WE DON'T NEED
TO FOLLOW YOU.

16:16.640 --> 16:19.302
I ALREADY KNOW WHERE HERB'S
SUPER SHADY SUSPICIOUS LOCKER IS

16:19.340 --> 16:21.308
BECAUSE OF THIS.

16:24.180 --> 16:25.442
DID HE JUST THROW
A LOAFER AT ME?

16:25.480 --> 16:27.573
- IT WAS A MAGNANNI SLIP-ON.
- WHAT?

16:27.620 --> 16:29.247
- WHAT, I KNOW
MY LOAFERS, SHAWN,

16:29.280 --> 16:32.044
AND I WON'T
APOLOGIZE FOR IT.

16:32.090 --> 16:36.254
- FLOYD, I THINK YOU'RE
GONNA NEED YOUR SHOE.

16:48.570 --> 16:50.561
IT'S NOT NUMBER NINE, FLOYD.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.339
- THIS IS LUCKY NUMBER NINE.

16:52.370 --> 16:53.803
- ISN'T THAT
YOUR LUCKY NUMBER?

16:53.840 --> 16:55.307
- NO, THAT'S
MY FAVORITE NUMBER.

16:55.340 --> 16:57.149
- YOU HAVE A FAVORITE NUMBER
AND A LUCKY NUMBER?

16:57.180 --> 16:58.602
- I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO
THIS WITH YOU RIGHT NOW, DON.

16:58.650 --> 16:59.708
- DO WE SOUND LIKE THAT?

16:59.750 --> 17:01.047
- THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE SOUND LIKE.

17:08.160 --> 17:08.910
- LOUIE SHARAVINO.

17:08.960 --> 17:10.450
I TOLD YOU
IT WASN'T NUMBER NINE.

17:10.490 --> 17:11.821
- MAN, YOU DIDN'T
TELL ME NOTHING.

17:11.860 --> 17:13.122
- GUYS, WOULD YOU LIKE
A LITTLE HELP

17:13.160 --> 17:14.354
FROM THE PALM READER?

17:14.400 --> 17:16.095
- WE GOT IT UNDER CONTROL,
RICK.

17:16.130 --> 17:17.768
- LOOKS LIKE ALL BOONE HAS
IS SOME BABY POWDER

17:17.800 --> 17:19.119
AND A BAG OF PRETZELS.

17:19.170 --> 17:20.569
- WHOA, WHOA,
I THINK WE CAN USE THAT.

17:20.600 --> 17:21.567
WHAT KINDA PRETZELS ARE THOSE?

17:21.600 --> 17:23.067
- SNYDER'S OF HANOVER.

17:23.110 --> 17:24.668
YOU GET ANYTHING
OUT OF THAT?

17:24.710 --> 17:26.109
- YES.

17:26.140 --> 17:28.700
THE HUNGRIES.

17:28.740 --> 17:30.241
- YOU CAN'T HAVE THESE.

17:38.120 --> 17:40.179
- GENTLEMEN, I BELIEVE
WE ARE LOOKING FOR

17:40.220 --> 17:42.780
LUCKY LOCKER NUMBER 22.

17:42.820 --> 17:44.321
- FLOYD'LL BREAK INTO IT.

17:44.360 --> 17:46.578
- NO, NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
GUS CAN DO IT.

17:46.630 --> 17:48.359
- OH, GO AHEAD.
BE PROUD.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.561
YOU CAN CRACK LOCKS
AND STEAL THINGS.

17:50.600 --> 17:51.567
TYPICAL.

17:51.600 --> 17:52.794
- FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

17:52.830 --> 17:54.468
I USED TO HAVE
AN ONLINE SUBSCRIPTION

17:54.500 --> 17:55.592
TO SAFE CRACKING MAGAZINE.

17:55.640 --> 17:56.595
- HEY, HEY, HEY.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.858
YOU'RE DISAPPOINTING ME, SON.

17:58.910 --> 18:01.435
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK,

18:01.480 --> 18:03.402
I SAY THIS WITH GREAT RESPECT
FOR HERB'S LEGACY,

18:03.450 --> 18:04.849
BUT LET'S JUST RECAP,
SHALL WE?

18:04.880 --> 18:06.279
HIS HOUSE WAS BURGLED.

18:06.310 --> 18:08.642
HE WAS SHOT
EXECUTION-STYLE.

18:08.680 --> 18:09.817
HE'S CANOODLING
WITH SOME YOUNG VIXEN.

18:09.850 --> 18:11.215
AND NOW WE BELIEVE
HE IS STORING EVIDENCE

18:11.250 --> 18:13.389
IN HIS SECRET LOCKER.

18:13.420 --> 18:16.150
IS IT AT LEAST POSSIBLE
HE WAS LIVING A DOUBLE LIFE?

18:16.190 --> 18:18.556
both: NO.

18:18.590 --> 18:20.626
- NICE.

18:32.270 --> 18:34.272
OH, BOY.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.619
- SIMPLY NO EASY WAY
TO SAY THIS,

18:45.650 --> 18:47.550
THOUGH I DON'T ANTICIPATE IT
BEING DIFFICULT TO SAY.

18:47.590 --> 18:50.650
HERB WILKINS IS THE OLDEST
DRUG KINGPIN

18:50.690 --> 18:52.419
IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.

18:52.460 --> 18:54.928
- ACTUALLY, SHAWN, THE OLDEST
DRUG KINGPIN IS A GUY NAMED--

18:54.960 --> 18:56.825
- I CAN'T DO THIS
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.

18:56.860 --> 18:58.498
- MAYBE HE WAS STILL
WORKING UNDERCOVER.

18:58.530 --> 19:01.169
- YEAH, THE GREAT COPS NEVER
TRULY RETIRE.

19:01.200 --> 19:02.861
- THESE DRUGS
ARE STILL CIRCUMSTANTIAL.

19:02.900 --> 19:04.800
- AGREED, BUT THIS IS ALL
STARTING TO PAINT

19:04.840 --> 19:06.364
A WORRISOME PICTURE.

19:06.410 --> 19:07.536
- I JUST GOT CONFIRMATION

19:07.580 --> 19:09.502
THAT HERB WITHDREW $50,000

19:09.540 --> 19:12.577
FROM HIS SAVINGS ACCOUNT
THREE DAYS AGO IN CASH.

19:12.610 --> 19:15.408
- PRESUMABLY TO BUY THIS
SURPLUS OF NOSE CANDY.

19:15.450 --> 19:17.509
- EVIDENCE POINTS
TO A DRUG HIT.

19:17.550 --> 19:19.279
- THIS IS BAD.
THIS IS REALLY BAD.

19:19.320 --> 19:21.550
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS, LOOK,
THIS IS NOT THE MAN WE KNEW.

19:21.590 --> 19:23.751
YOU GUYS JUST DO
WHAT YOU DO BEST.

19:23.790 --> 19:25.678
LET'S GET TO THE BOTTOM
OF THIS.

19:25.730 --> 19:29.257
WE OWE IT TO HERB, HUH?

19:35.700 --> 19:37.702
-IDO.

19:37.740 --> 19:39.628
- YOU MIND PICKING UP MY DUDS?

19:39.670 --> 19:40.705
THEY'LL BE READY
AT FIVE SHARP.

19:40.740 --> 19:42.628
- NO, BUT I'LL PICK
YOUR TEETH UP OFF THE FLOOR

19:42.680 --> 19:44.204
IF YOU ASK ME THAT AGAIN.

19:46.680 --> 19:49.672
WHAT COULD HE POSSIBLY
NEED DRY-CLEANED?

19:49.720 --> 19:51.711
- THOSE CRAFTY OLD DEVILS.

19:51.750 --> 19:53.650
THEY SWIPED A BOOK OF MATCHES
FROM EVIDENCE.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.791
[horn honks]

20:05.030 --> 20:07.237

20:18.010 --> 20:20.274
BUT ALWAYS DRIVE AS IF
WE'RE IN A SCHOOL ZONE?

20:20.320 --> 20:21.810
- IT'S LIKE WE'RE FOLLOWING
RICHARD FARNSWORTH

20:21.850 --> 20:23.511
IN THE STRAIGHT STORY.

20:23.550 --> 20:25.415

DON'T HAVE TURN SIGNALS.

20:25.450 --> 20:28.283

- WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

20:33.030 --> 20:35.419
ROLL 'EM UP.

20:42.500 --> 20:46.334
- IT IS IN YOUR BEST INTEREST
TO STAY AWAY FROM US.

20:48.740 --> 20:50.776
- WE'RE ON THIS CASE TOO.

20:50.810 --> 20:52.368
- YOU'RE JUST TRYING
TO TAINT HERB'S GOOD NAME.

20:52.410 --> 20:53.672
- WE'RE TRYING TO CATCH
A KILLER, SAME AS YOU.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.017
- SAME AS ME?

20:55.050 --> 20:58.042
DON'T YOU EVER USE
THE WORDS "SAME" AND "ME"

20:58.090 --> 21:00.308
AND "YOU" IN THE SAME
SENTENCE AGAIN.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.987
- I DIDN'T PUT "ME" IN.
IT WAS JUST "SAME" AND "YOU."

21:02.020 --> 21:05.353
- LOOK, I KNOW YOU SWIPED
THE MATCHBOOK FROM EVIDENCE.

21:05.390 --> 21:06.721
- SO?
- SO WE WERE GONNA DO THAT.

21:06.760 --> 21:08.057
JUST LET US IN
ON THE LEAD.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.954
- YOU GUYS JUST DON'T KNOW
WHEN TO QUIT, DO YOU?

21:10.000 --> 21:12.321
- NO, GUS AND I NEVER KNOW
WHEN TO THROW IN THE TOWEL.

21:12.370 --> 21:13.496
- WE'RE READY
FOR THE NEXT ROUND.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.428
- RING THE BELL.

21:15.470 --> 21:16.892
- BOONE, RELAX.

21:16.940 --> 21:19.329
WE DON'T CARE
WHAT HERB WAS UP TO.

21:19.370 --> 21:21.531
LET'S PUT OUR DIFFERENCES ASIDE
AND WORK TOGETHER ON THIS.

21:21.580 --> 21:22.831
OKAY, I MEAN,
BETWEEN THE FOUR OF US,

WHAT DO YOU SAY?

21:28.420 --> 21:31.583
WE'RE THE APPLES.
YOU'RE THE ORANGES.

21:31.620 --> 21:35.886

THE SAME FRUIT.

21:35.920 --> 21:36.989

WE'RE THE GRAPPLES.

21:56.940 --> 21:58.498

21:58.550 --> 22:00.415
- WHAT'S A GUY IN HIS 70$
DOING VISITING A NIGHTCLUB

22:03.080 --> 22:04.911
- WELL, WHAT ARE
WE WAITING FOR?

22:04.950 --> 22:07.612

IS ACTUALLY OPEN.

22:07.660 --> 22:12.029
- THE DOLLHOUSE, 9:00.
SEE YA.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.854

THE GOOD NEWS

22:15.900 --> 22:17.822

22:17.870 --> 22:20.634
TO CHANGE INTO
MY CLUB CLOTHES, FLOYD.

- [imitating Boone] YOU DON'T
HAVE CLUB CLOTHES, DON.

22:22.700 --> 22:24.531

EXACTLY.

22:26.610 --> 22:27.577

[club music]

22:30.610 --> 22:38.619

22:40.760 --> 22:42.580
- WELL, LOOK AT THAT.

22:42.620 --> 22:44.588
WE BEAT PETERS AND BOONE
TO THE PUNCH,

22:44.630 --> 22:46.689
AND IT FEELS GOOD.

22:46.730 --> 22:48.652
I GUESS THAT MEANS
WE GOT SOME TIME TO KILL.

22:48.700 --> 22:54.935
*

22:54.970 --> 22:56.562
- OH, MY GOD.

23:03.710 --> 23:05.678
- I REALLY HOPE BOONE DOESN'T
TAKE OUT HIS GUN ON HER.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.674
- PFFI'.

23:09.720 --> 23:10.982
- WE WERE RIGHT.

23:11.020 --> 23:13.750
- YEAH, HERB WAS IN HERE
SEVERAL TIMES

23:13.790 --> 23:15.917
WITH A HOT YOUNG THING
NAMED SARALYN.

23:15.960 --> 23:18.451
- HER CO-DANCER
SAID THAT SARALYN

23:18.490 --> 23:19.787
LIKES TO HUSTLE CASH.

23:19.830 --> 23:21.855
- I'M GETTING SOMETHING.

23:21.900 --> 23:24.994
- LONG RED HAIR,
ABOUT 20 YEARS OLD.

23:25.030 --> 23:27.635
SHE WORKS AT THE PACIFIC
TREASURES SHOP OVER THERE.

23:27.670 --> 23:30.503
- SARALYN WAS YOUNG.
YOUNG REDHEAD.

23:30.540 --> 23:31.734
- HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

23:31.770 --> 23:32.964
- I'M ALSO SENSING
SHE DIDN'T SHOW UP

23:33.010 --> 23:34.170
TO ANY OF HER SHIFTS
THIS WEEK.

23:34.210 --> 23:35.700
- I BET SHE'S THE SAME GIRL
THAT WORKS

23:35.740 --> 23:37.469
AT THE PACIFIC TREASURES SHOP
AT THE WHARF.

23:37.510 --> 23:38.579
- THAT'S RIGHT.

23:38.610 --> 23:41.773
SEE THAT'S WHY HERB TOOK
50 GRAND OUT OF HIS ACCOUNT.

23:41.820 --> 23:44.914
HE WAS BEING SEDUCED AND
SWINDLED BY SOME YOUNG HUSSY.

23:44.950 --> 23:46.212
- BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE BAG OF COCAINE

23:46.250 --> 23:47.751
WE FOUND IN HERB'S LOCKER?

23:47.790 --> 23:49.109
- HE'S PROBABLY DEALING DOPE
ON THE SIDE.

23:49.160 --> 23:50.889
THAT'S WHY HE HAD
SUCH A FAT BANK ACCOUNT.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.921
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU JUST HOLD ON.

23:52.960 --> 23:56.157

ON THE PRINTS WE TOOK

24:09.640 --> 24:10.504
FROM HERB'S BOAT.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.245
THEY'RE FROM A GUY
NAMED OTTO DERZIUS,

24:12.280 --> 24:14.168
A SUSPECTED DRUG DEALER
WE'VE BEEN KEEPING TABS ON.

24:14.220 --> 24:15.847

DID YOU ARREST HIM YET?

24:15.880 --> 24:16.812
- NO, WE'RE ON OUR WAY
TO GET HIM.

24:16.850 --> 24:18.181
HE OWNS A NIGHTCLUB

YOU EVER HEARD OF IT?

24:19.220 --> 24:20.756

24:25.590 --> 24:26.784
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

24:26.830 --> 24:28.718
MUST BE SOME SORT OF RUSH
AT THE BOOK DROP.

24:28.760 --> 24:30.762
- SHAWN, I KNOW THAT YOU
ARE AT THAT CLUB.

24:30.800 --> 24:32.665
DO NOT TALK TO OTTO
AND DO NOT SEARCH HIS OFFICE.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.668
- COPY.

24:40.810 --> 24:41.834

THIS CLUB.

24:50.120 --> 24:54.079
- HEY, I BET SARALYN AND THIS
OTTO SCUMBAG ARE A TEAM.

24:54.120 --> 24:57.214
- YEAH, THEY SWINDLED HERB
AND THEN KILLED HIM.

24:57.260 --> 24:59.649
- LISTEN, THE COPS ARE ON
THEIR WAY DOWN HERE.

24:59.690 --> 25:02.022
WE'VE BEEN GIVEN STRICT ORDERS
NOT TO TALK TO OTTO

25:02.060 --> 25:04.096
OR SEARCH HIS OFFICE.

25:04.130 --> 25:05.097
- WE DON'T WANT TO WAIT
AROUND FOR THAT.

25:05.130 --> 25:06.165
- WELL, NEITHER CAN WE.

25:11.670 --> 25:15.037
DUDE, THAT GUY LOOKS LIKE
A BILLY ZANE ACTION FIGURE.

25:15.080 --> 25:17.105
- YEAH, HE DOES.

25:17.140 --> 25:18.971
- HE'S A GROWN-ASS MAN, SHAWN.
I DOUBT HE'S FOR SALE.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.569
- YEAH.

25:22.620 --> 25:24.019
- WE'RE GONNA DO A THING
FROM THE OLD DAYS

25:24.050 --> 25:25.244
CALLED "BARK-N-MARK."

25:25.290 --> 25:27.554

25:31.760 --> 25:33.250
HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

25:33.290 --> 25:35.155
WE'RE GONNA START A GREASE
FIRE IN THE MEN'S BATHROOM.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.224
- ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

25:36.260 --> 25:37.796
- HOW 'BOUT

25:48.880 --> 25:52.099
THE SERIAL NUMBER ON THIS GUN
HAS BEEN FILED OFF.

25:52.150 --> 25:53.708
- JUST LIKE THE GUN
ON THE BOAT.

26:07.360 --> 26:10.693
WELL, WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?

26:10.730 --> 26:14.336

- YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT 'CAUSE
YOU DON'T WANNA CATCH OTTO.

27:00.350 --> 27:01.317
- DUDE, WE'RE BARELY JOGGING.

27:01.350 --> 27:03.318
WE HAVE NO CHANCE IN HELL
OF CATCHING OTTO.

27:03.350 --> 27:05.045
- AHH!
I JUST PULLED MY HAMMY.

27:05.090 --> 27:06.717
- YOU CAN'T USE
A FAKE HAMMY PULL

27:06.750 --> 27:08.718
IMMEDIATELY AFTER CALLING ME
OUT FOR USING IT.

27:08.760 --> 27:09.784
- NO, I REALLY PULLED
MY HAM--

27:09.820 --> 27:11.048
[gunshots]

27:14.800 --> 27:15.858
- TALK TO ME, GUS!

27:15.900 --> 27:17.868
- I'M OKAY!
- ALL RIGHT!

27:35.780 --> 27:38.681
WELL, WE CAUGHT UP TO OTTO.

27:46.360 --> 27:49.750
- THE FOUR OF YOU ARE LIKE
AN INCOMPETENCE MACHINE.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.995
YOU WERE GIVEN
SPECIFIC ORDERS,

27:52.030 --> 27:53.793
AND YOU DID
THE EXACT OPPOSITE.

27:53.840 --> 27:56.092
- CHIEF, MAY I SAY SOMETHING
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF

27:56.140 --> 27:57.869
AND A TEENNBIT OF GUS?

27:57.910 --> 28:00.162
- THE PSYCHIC REALM TAKES
ORDERS FROM NO ONE, CHIEF.

28:00.210 --> 28:01.438
WHEN I FEEL, I MUST ACT,

28:01.480 --> 28:03.948
AND SOMETIMES THAT REQUIRES

28:03.980 --> 28:06.904
BENDING...

28:06.950 --> 28:07.917
OVER.

28:07.950 --> 28:10.214
YOU'RE RIGHT.
CARRY ON.

28:10.250 --> 28:12.480
- OTTO DERZIUS

28:12.520 --> 28:14.408
WAS OUR PRIME SUSPECT.

28:14.460 --> 28:17.827
HE'S NOT MUCH GOOD TO US NOW.

28:19.290 --> 28:20.848
AND LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

28:20.900 --> 28:24.165
YOU BROKE INTO OTTO'S OFFICE
AND WHAT'D YOU GET?

28:24.200 --> 28:26.327
HMM?

28:26.370 --> 28:29.999
MR. GUSTER, TELL ME,

28:30.040 --> 28:31.405
WHAT'D YOU GET?

28:31.440 --> 28:33.772
- NOTHING, CHIEF.

28:33.810 --> 28:35.778
WE GOT A WHOLE LOT OF NOTHING.

28:35.810 --> 28:37.277
- THAT'S RIGHT.

28:37.310 --> 28:40.768
NOTHING.

28:40.820 --> 28:44.881
WHAT ABOUT YOU, MR. BOONE,
WHAT'D YOU GET?

28:44.920 --> 28:47.343
MENUS.

28:47.390 --> 28:48.789
WELL DONE.

28:48.820 --> 28:50.458
- WHAT'D I TELL YOU
ABOUT THE MENUS, FLOYD?

28:50.490 --> 28:52.424
- COME ON, YOU KNOW THERE'S
SOME NEW TAKEOUT PLACES--

28:52.460 --> 28:54.348
- THERE'S A TIME AND A PLACE
FOR SNATCHING MENUS.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.129
- YOU'RE SAYING A MAN DOESN'T
HAVE TO EAT? COME ON!

28:56.160 --> 28:57.798
- NO, I'M NOT SAYING
WE DON'T NEED TO EAT.

28:57.830 --> 28:58.797
- EXCUSE ME.

28:58.830 --> 28:59.797
YOU'RE BOTH FIRED.

28:59.830 --> 29:02.537
YOU'RE OFF THIS INVESTIGATION.

29:02.570 --> 29:05.903
- WELL, THEM'S THE BREAKS.

29:05.940 --> 29:07.066
SOMETIMES YOU GOTTA MAKE
THE TOUGH DECISIONS, CHIEF.

29:07.110 --> 29:08.930
- OH, YOU'RE FIRED TOO,
SPENCER.

29:08.980 --> 29:10.208
YOU'RE ALL OFF THIS CASE.

29:10.240 --> 29:11.502
both: WHAT?

29:11.550 --> 29:13.814
- NO, THAT'S--

29:19.950 --> 29:21.451
- HENRY.

29:21.490 --> 29:22.889
YOU STAY.

29:28.930 --> 29:31.194
- YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN FIRED
FROM MANY JOBS, GUS.

29:31.230 --> 29:32.868
MANY JOBS.
- WELL, I HAVEN'T.

29:32.900 --> 29:34.458
- MOST OF THEM SET
SURPRISINGLY WELL WITH ME,

29:34.500 --> 29:35.797
BUT NOT THIS ONE.

29:35.840 --> 29:38.365
I REPEAT, THIS ONE
IS NOT SITTING WELL.

29:38.410 --> 29:39.934
WE COULD STILL
SOLVE THIS CASE.

29:39.970 --> 29:41.005
- OH, NO, WE CAN'T.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.473
- BY "WE" I MEAN "US"
AND BY "US" I MEAN "THEM,"

29:42.510 --> 29:44.808
BECAUSE "US" PLUS "THEM"
EQUALS "WE."

29:44.850 --> 29:46.306
- SHAWN, YOU NEED
TO JUST SHUT IT DOWN.

29:46.350 --> 29:47.817
- NO, WE NEED
TO START IT UP.

29:47.850 --> 29:49.442
WE NEED TO REUNITE
WITH PETERS AND BOONE.

29:49.480 --> 29:50.572
BRING THIS BABY HOME.

29:50.620 --> 29:52.542
YOU KNOW WHAT, I THINK
WE UNDERESTIMATED THOSE GUYS.

29:52.590 --> 29:55.058
- DID YOU NOT SEE THE HANDFUL
OF MENUS IN BOONE'S HAND?

29:55.090 --> 29:55.852
- GUS, WE'VE BEEN WATCHING

29:55.890 --> 29:57.084
THESE OLD GEEZERS
FROM THE START.

29:57.120 --> 29:58.189
- SO?

29:58.230 --> 30:00.892
- YOU KNOW DAMN WELL HE TOOK
MORE THAN JUST MENUS.

30:00.930 --> 30:02.056
THOSE GUYS ARE CRAFTY.

30:02.100 --> 30:03.453
BOONE IS WILY.

30:03.500 --> 30:04.922
- WAIT A SECOND.

30:04.970 --> 30:06.597
JUST LIKE THE MATCHBOOK.
- EXACTLY.

30:06.630 --> 30:08.530
- WE NEED TO FIND THEM NOW.
- AND BY "WE" YOU MEAN "US,"

30:08.570 --> 30:10.936
AND BY "US"
YOU MEAN "THEM."

30:10.970 --> 30:11.800
IT MAKES SENSE, GUS.

30:20.310 --> 30:22.039
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP.

30:22.080 --> 30:23.172
WE'VE HAD OUR DIFFERENCES
IN THE PAST,

30:23.220 --> 30:25.609
BUT WE LEARNED TWO VERY
VALUABLE LESSONS FROM YOU GUYS.

30:25.650 --> 30:28.619
ONE, IT IS NEVER TOO EARLY
TO START TRIMMING OUR EYEBROWS.

30:28.660 --> 30:31.151
AND TWO, GOOD COP INSTINCTS
NEVER DIE.

30:31.190 --> 30:32.851
- AND ONE THING I KNOW FOR SURE
ABOUT YOU, BOONE,

30:32.890 --> 30:34.357
IT'S THAT YOU TAKE ONE THING
AND GIVE TO THE CHIEF,

30:34.400 --> 30:36.960
LIKE MENUS,
AND YOU TAKE SOMETHING ELSE

30:37.000 --> 30:38.922
THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY USE
TO SOLVE THIS CASE.

30:38.970 --> 30:40.494
- NOT BAD, FELLAS.

30:40.530 --> 30:42.088
TAKE IT.

30:42.140 --> 30:43.903
TH ESE ARE ALL
THE JOB APPLICATIONS

30:43.940 --> 30:44.907
FOR THE GIRLS
AT THE DOLLHOUSE.

30:44.940 --> 30:45.929
- I KNEW IT.

30:45.970 --> 30:47.198
YOU STILL HAVE
YOUR GOOD STUFF.

30:47.240 --> 30:48.969
THAT MEANS WE HAVE
SARALYN'S ADDRESS.

30:49.010 --> 30:50.204
COME ON, LET'S GO
SEARCH HER HOUSE.

30:50.240 --> 30:51.207
- LET'S TRACK HER DOWN.

30:51.250 --> 30:54.515
- REDEEM OURSELVES.

30:54.550 --> 30:57.986
FELLAS!

30:58.020 --> 30:59.214
LOOK, I THINK YOU GUYS
WERE RIGHT.

30:59.250 --> 31:00.387
SARALYN TEAMED UP WITH OTTO,

31:00.420 --> 31:01.648
THEY SWINDLED HERB
OUT OF HIS 50K,

31:01.690 --> 31:02.486
AND THEN THEY KILLED HIM.

31:02.520 --> 31:03.612
- AND THEN THAT VIXEN
KILLED OTTO,

31:03.660 --> 31:04.684
BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO KEEP
ALL THE MONEY FOR HERSELF.

31:04.730 --> 31:07.654
- WHAT ABOUT THE COCAINE
WE FOUND IN HERB'S LOCKER?

31:07.690 --> 31:09.191
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT
FOR NOW.

31:09.230 --> 31:10.993
- COME ON, LET'S DO THIS.
- WE CAN'T.

31:11.030 --> 31:13.294
FLOYD AND I THOUGHT
WE MISSED THE COP'S LIFE.

31:13.330 --> 31:16.458
WE THOUGHT WE STILL HAD
SOMETHING LEFT IN THE TANK.

31:16.500 --> 31:17.933
WE ACTUALLY BELIEVED
THAT WE COULD HELP YOU

31:17.970 --> 31:19.005
SOLVE HERB'S MURDER.

31:19.040 --> 31:20.974
- YEAH.

31:21.010 --> 31:22.898
HAVING A PUNK
SMASHING ME IN THE KNEES

31:22.940 --> 31:25.079
WITH WOODEN BATS
AND PEOPLE SPRAYING BULLETS

31:25.110 --> 31:26.646
ALL OVER THE DAMN PLACE,

31:26.680 --> 31:28.648
I'D RATHER JUST PLAY
MY CHECKERS.

31:28.680 --> 31:29.612
- OKAY, WAIT A SECOND,
WAIT A SECOND.

31:29.650 --> 31:31.481
YOU GUYS ARE TELLING ME
THAT YOU WANNA QUIT

31:31.520 --> 31:33.147
BECAUSE YOU GOT HIT
WITH A SPORTING GOOD?

31:33.190 --> 31:35.681
WELL, GUESS WHAT,
SO DO WE.

31:35.720 --> 31:38.086
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
HOLD UP.

31:38.130 --> 31:40.086
WHAT KINDA PSYCHO
CON-WOMAN KILLER

31:40.130 --> 31:42.428
PUTS DOWN HER MARK
AS AN EMERGENCY CONTACT?

31:42.460 --> 31:44.928
- MY FOURTH WIFE, MAUDINE.

31:46.700 --> 31:48.930
- SERIOUSLY, NOBODY ELSE
THINKS THIS IS WEIRD?

31:48.970 --> 31:50.938
- OH, NO,
IT'S DEFINITELY WEIRD.

31:50.970 --> 31:53.359
- I DON'T THINK SARALYN
KILLED ANYBODY.

31:53.410 --> 31:55.571
GUYS, WE HAVE TO FIND HER.

31:55.610 --> 31:58.704
SHE IS THE KEY TO THIS CASE,
AND WE CAN'T DO IT ALONE.

31:58.750 --> 32:01.173
WE NEED TWO ROCK-SOLID COPS
BY OUR SIDES.

32:01.220 --> 32:03.677
IT'S LIKE I TOLD GUS EARLIER,

32:03.720 --> 32:05.608
YOU ARE US,
AND WE ARE YOU,

32:05.650 --> 32:09.051
AND YOU ARE THEM.

32:09.090 --> 32:10.580
AND THEY ARE YOU.

32:10.620 --> 32:12.383
AND TOGETHER,
WE ARE ALL OF IT, MAN.

32:12.430 --> 32:13.658
WE ARE ALL OF IT, JACK.

32:13.690 --> 32:17.251
- OKAY, SOMETIMES HE DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

32:17.300 --> 32:19.188
- I GET WHAT HE'S SAYING.

32:19.230 --> 32:20.697
- REALLY?
- THANK YOU, BOONE.

32:20.730 --> 32:22.334
I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO DO THIS FOR ME.

32:22.370 --> 32:24.668
GOD KNOWS I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO DO IT FOR GUS.

32:24.710 --> 32:26.598
DO IT FOR HERB.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.631
IT'S TIME THE FOUR GRAPPLES
GOT BACK TOGETHER

32:28.680 --> 32:30.534
AND CLEARED HIS GOOD NAME.

32:33.010 --> 32:34.443
Peters and Boone:
WE'RE BACK.

32:34.480 --> 32:36.243
- SWEET.
- YOU WERE NEVER GONE.

32:36.280 --> 32:38.714
- WELL, THEY WERE GONE
FOR 20 YEARS.

32:38.750 --> 32:41.583
- FELLAS,
CARS ARE THIS WAY.

32:48.160 --> 32:50.151
[knocking on door]

32:51.800 --> 32:53.620
HELLO THERE.

32:53.670 --> 32:56.195
MY NAME IS SHAWN SPENCER.
I'M A PSYCHIC DETECTIVE.

32:56.240 --> 32:58.629
THIS IS MY PARTNER,
CONTROL-ALT-DELETE.

32:58.670 --> 33:00.763
THE GENTLEMEN ON THE FLANK
ARE US IN 30 YEARS.

33:00.810 --> 33:02.038
- 60 YEARS.
- 20 YEARS.

33:02.080 --> 33:03.138
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

33:03.180 --> 33:05.307
- WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SARALYN.

33:05.350 --> 33:06.703
- THE COPS WERE JUST HERE

33:06.750 --> 33:07.774
I TOLD THEM
EVERYTHING I KNOW.

33:07.810 --> 33:09.346
all: YOU'RE LYING.

33:09.380 --> 33:11.143
- OKAY, OKAY, I DIDN'T
TELL THE COPS EVERYTHING.

33:11.190 --> 33:13.181
- UH, BOONE, MAYBE YOU WANT
TO RELAX YOUR TRIGGER FINGER.

33:13.220 --> 33:14.517
- TUCK IT.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.050
- NOW WOULD YOU BE SO KIND
AS TO LET US IN

33:16.090 --> 33:20.026
SO WE CAN ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS?

33:20.060 --> 33:21.095
- THANK YOU.

33:21.130 --> 33:22.358
- HOW'D YOU KNOW
SHE WAS LYING?

33:22.400 --> 33:23.719
- I'M A PSYCHIC, PETERS.

33:23.760 --> 33:24.795
- HOW DID YOU KNOW
SHE WAS LYING?

33:24.830 --> 33:26.695
both: SHE'S A WOMAN.

33:33.710 --> 33:36.031
- TELL US EVERYTHING YOU KNOW

33:36.080 --> 33:37.707
ABOUT SARALYN'S INVOLVEMENT
IN THE MURDER

33:37.740 --> 33:39.571
OF HERB WILKINS.

33:39.610 --> 33:44.115
- I USED TO WORK AT
THE DOLLHOUSE WITH SARALYN.

33:44.150 --> 33:46.311
SHE SAID THAT SHE NEEDED
TO MAKE SOME EXTRA MONEY,

33:46.350 --> 33:48.511
SO I TOLD HER
ABOUT THIS JOB I WAS DOING

33:48.560 --> 33:49.709
FOR OTTO ON THE SIDE.

33:49.760 --> 33:51.387
- PACIFIC TREASURES.

33:51.430 --> 33:52.385
- YEAH.

33:52.430 --> 33:53.681
LOOK, ALL I CAN TELL YOU

33:53.730 --> 33:55.322
IS THAT A BAG WOULD APPEAR
INSIDE THE SHOP

33:55.360 --> 33:56.657
A FEW TIMES A MONTH.

33:56.700 --> 33:58.759
I DELIVERED IT TO OTTO.
I DIDN'T ASK ANY QUESTIONS.

33:58.800 --> 34:01.234
BUT MY ONLY WAY
OUT OF THE JOB

34:01.270 --> 34:05.058
WAS TO FIND A GIRL
TO TAKE OVER FOR ME.

34:05.110 --> 34:06.236
SARALYN WANTED TO DO IT,

34:06.270 --> 34:07.635
AND IT WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE DANGEROUS.

34:07.670 --> 34:10.275
- YOU WIN THE WORST FRIEND
EVER AWARD, SWEETIE.

34:10.310 --> 34:13.074
- TRUST ME,
I FEEL TERRIBLE.

34:13.110 --> 34:15.214
- FLOYD AND I HELPED HERB
CATCH THAT WALLEYE.

34:15.250 --> 34:17.639
- NOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA PLAY
IS A LITTLE GAME CALLED

34:17.680 --> 34:20.513
"DAMN GOOD CHANCE
YOU'RE GETTIN' SHOT."

34:20.550 --> 34:23.348
IT'S THE SAME TYPE OF BAG
WE SAW IN HERB'S LOCKER.

34:23.390 --> 34:24.755
- IT WAS SALT.

34:26.730 --> 34:29.619
THE DRUGS CAME IN ON A BOAT
CALLED THE DOUBLE WHAMMY.

34:29.660 --> 34:33.664
NO, IT'S NOT--
TWIN KIES.

34:33.700 --> 34:36.498
SECOND WIND,
THAT'S IT.

34:36.540 --> 34:37.393
THE NAME OF THE BOAT WAS
THE SECOND WIND.

34:37.440 --> 34:38.600
THE DRUG LORD WOULD
DOCK AT THE WHARF,

34:38.640 --> 34:39.732
DROP THE BAG OF LOOT OFF

34:39.770 --> 34:40.759
AT PACIFIC TREASURES,

34:40.810 --> 34:42.334
AND YOU AND SARALYN

34:42.380 --> 34:43.836
WERE MULES.

34:46.480 --> 34:47.799
WAIT A SECOND.

34:47.850 --> 34:49.442
- WE SPOKE TO HERB'S
DAUGHTER, CAROLINE.

34:49.480 --> 34:50.617
THEY HAVEN'T SPOKEN
IN YEARS.

34:50.650 --> 34:53.813
- SARALYN REMINDED HERB
OF HIS DAUGHTER,

34:53.850 --> 34:55.283
THE ONE HE HADN'T
SPOKEN TO IN YEARS.

34:55.320 --> 34:56.810
THEY EVEN HAD
THE SAME RED HAIR.

34:56.860 --> 34:58.350
- HERB WAS TRYING
TO PROTECT HER.

34:58.390 --> 35:00.881
THAT'S WHY HE TOOK
THE 50 GS OUT OF THAT ACCOUNT.

35:00.930 --> 35:02.557
- HE WAS TRYING
TO BUY HER FREEDOM.

35:02.600 --> 35:03.897
- WHAT ABOUT THE BAG OF COKE
WE FOUND IN HERB'S LOCKER?

35:03.930 --> 35:05.727
- WELL, WHEN HE FOUND OUT
WHAT SHE WAS UP TO,

35:05.770 --> 35:08.159
HE DIDN'T WANT HER
TO MAKE THAT LAST DELIVERY.

35:08.200 --> 35:09.838
I'D BET THE FARM ON THAT.

35:09.870 --> 35:10.837
- THAT'S THE HERB WE KNEW.

35:10.870 --> 35:12.667
- DID YOU EVER GET A LOOK
AT THIS DRUG LORD?

35:12.710 --> 35:14.769
- NO, HE WAS LIKE A GHOST.

35:14.810 --> 35:17.472
- HEY, HE WASN'T NO GHOST.

35:17.510 --> 35:19.148
HE'S A MAN.

35:19.180 --> 35:21.842
WE'RE GONNA FIND HIM,
AND WE'RE GONNA KILL HIM.

35:21.880 --> 35:23.677
- WE'RE NOT GONNA KILL HIM,
FLOYD.

35:23.720 --> 35:25.244
- DON'T BE SO SURE.

35:25.290 --> 35:26.643
- ALL RIGHT,
SO WHAT DO WE GOT?

35:26.690 --> 35:28.749
WE GOT THIS DRUG LORD
AND OTTO.

35:28.790 --> 35:31.258
THEY SILENCE HERB TO PROTECT
THEIR OPERATION.

35:31.290 --> 35:33.224
AND THEN WE BRING
THE HEAT ON OTTO.

35:33.260 --> 35:34.852
THE DRUG LORD CUTS HIM DOWN
BEFORE HE CAN TALK.

35:34.900 --> 35:36.891
- SARALYN'S THE LAST PIECE
OF THE PUZZLE.

35:36.930 --> 35:38.522
- YEAH, WE GOTTA FIND OUT
WHERE SARALYN IS.

35:38.570 --> 35:39.662
CAN YOU HELP US OUT THERE,
JOSE?

35:39.700 --> 35:40.724
- I WISH I COULD.

35:40.770 --> 35:43.489
BUT SHE PACKED A BAG
A FEW DAYS AGO AND TOOK OFF.

35:43.540 --> 35:44.837
IT'S SO SAD.

35:44.870 --> 35:47.862
SHE WAS SO CLOSE
TO A FRESH START.

35:50.280 --> 35:52.748
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO GRADUATE
FROM SCHOOL IN A FEW WEEKS.

35:52.780 --> 35:54.247
- NURSING SCHOOL.

35:54.280 --> 35:55.713
- YEAH.

35:55.750 --> 35:57.672
- I KNOW WHERE
SARALYN'S HIDING.

35:57.720 --> 35:58.846
FOLLOW US TO HERB'S HOUSE.

35:58.890 --> 36:00.539
[pounding on door]

36:00.590 --> 36:02.751
- SARALYN,
WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE.

36:02.790 --> 36:03.916
- AND WE KNOW YOU DIDN'T
KILL ANYBODY.

36:03.960 --> 36:05.382
WE'RE HERE TO HELP YOU.

36:05.430 --> 36:06.658
- HEY, YOU DON'T COME
TO THIS DOOR,

36:06.690 --> 36:07.657
WE'RE GONNA COME THROUGH IT.

36:07.690 --> 36:08.918
- DAMN.

36:08.960 --> 36:10.791
GUS, THEY STILL GOT IT.
- YEAH, THEY DO.

36:12.830 --> 36:15.367
- GO AWAY.
I DON'T WANT YOUR HELP.

36:15.400 --> 36:17.368
- YES, YOU DO.
WE CAN PROTECT YOU.

36:17.400 --> 36:19.504
- NO, PEOPLE TRY AND HELP ME,
AND THEY END UP DEAD.

36:19.540 --> 36:20.905
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

36:22.840 --> 36:24.740
- I THINK WE SHOULD GET FRESH
PEACHES AND EAT THEM INSTEAD.

36:24.780 --> 36:26.304
- HOW 'BOUT A CHURRO?

36:26.350 --> 36:27.772
- YOU LISTEN TO ME,
YOUNG LADY,

36:27.810 --> 36:29.346
YOU'RE IN GRAVE DANGER.

36:29.380 --> 36:30.574
- I KNOW THAT.

36:30.620 --> 36:32.747
JUST GO AWAY.

36:36.420 --> 36:37.853
- CAN I GO NOW?
- YEAH, YOU CAN GO.

36:37.890 --> 36:39.687
HEY, I'M GONNA BE
WATCHING YOU.

36:39.730 --> 36:40.788
- ME TOO.

36:44.830 --> 36:47.219
- I KNOW WHO
THE DRUG LORD/KILLER IS.

36:56.740 --> 36:58.446
- OKAY, DOES ANYONE
ACTUALLY BELIEVE

36:58.480 --> 36:59.708
THAT SARALYN
IS IN THAT HOUSE ALONE?

36:59.750 --> 37:00.876
- NO.
- MM-MMM.

37:00.910 --> 37:02.275
- WHAT'S THE PLAN?

37:02.320 --> 37:04.686
- WELL, WE COULD SNEAK
THROUGH A WINDOW

37:04.720 --> 37:06.347
AND START A GREASE FIRE
IN THE BATHROOM.

37:06.390 --> 37:09.382
- DO IT SHAWN AND GUS STYLE.
- WE COULD.

37:09.420 --> 37:12.355
- WHAT WAS
THE BARK-N-MARK AGAIN?

37:12.390 --> 37:14.392
[Shawn and Gus
barking outside]

37:20.300 --> 37:21.699
- WHAT IN THE HELL?

37:21.740 --> 37:23.731
[barking continues]

37:34.350 --> 37:37.274
YOU BETTER GET OUTTA HERE
BEFORE YOU GET YOURSELF SHOT!

37:37.320 --> 37:39.413
- HOLD UP, HOLD UP.
WE WANT TO OFFER YOU A DEAL.

37:39.450 --> 37:41.008
SEND OUT SARALYN,

37:41.050 --> 37:42.449
TAKE MY FRIEND GUS.
- WHAT?

37:42.490 --> 37:43.457
- NO DEAL!

37:43.490 --> 37:45.287
- YEAH, NO DEAL!

37:45.330 --> 37:46.456
- FINE, I'M CALLING
THE POLICE.

37:46.490 --> 37:47.752
- YOU DIAL, SHE DIES.

37:47.790 --> 37:49.291
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

37:49.330 --> 37:51.469
SEND HER OUT.
TAKE SHAWN INSTEAD.

37:51.500 --> 37:53.297
- GET OUTTA HERE, YOU IDIOTS.
- TAKE GUS!

37:53.330 --> 37:54.934
- HE CAN PASS FOR OMAR EPPS
IN RESTAURANTS.

37:54.970 --> 37:56.164
- TAKE SHAWN.

37:56.200 --> 37:58.464
TRUST ME, YOU'LL FEEL BETTER
ABOUT YOURSELF IN COMPARISON.

37:58.510 --> 38:00.330
- WHERE ARE THOSE OLD-TIMERS?

38:00.370 --> 38:01.632
- I DON'T KNOW, BUT WE CAN'T
KEEP DISTRACTING HIM

38:01.680 --> 38:02.806
TOO MUCH LONGER.

38:02.840 --> 38:03.932
- ALL RIGHT,
FOLLOW MY LEAD.

38:03.980 --> 38:05.299
AGE BEFORE BEAUTY.

38:05.350 --> 38:06.442
- YOU'RE FOUR MONTHS OLDER
THAN I AM!

38:06.480 --> 38:07.572
- SINCE WHEN?
- SINCE BIRTH.

38:07.610 --> 38:09.874
- I'M GONNA HAVE
TO SHOOT THESE MORONS.

38:09.920 --> 38:10.978
- MAN, WHY YOU GOTTA BRING UP

38:11.020 --> 38:12.612
SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED
30 YEARS AGO?

38:29.570 --> 38:32.505
- YOU'RE UNDER ARREST, PUNK.

38:32.540 --> 38:33.837
- NICE JOB, DETECTIVE.

38:33.870 --> 38:36.407
- THANK YOU.

38:36.440 --> 38:38.806
- LET'S GO.
COME ON.

38:45.090 --> 38:47.445
- IT'S THE BARK-N-MARK.
- WHAT?

38:51.390 --> 38:53.756
- MAN, THINK
WE'LL STILL BE ABLE

38:53.790 --> 38:55.553
TO KNOCK DUDES OUT COLD
WHEN WE'RE IN OUR 60$?

38:55.600 --> 38:57.124
- WE CAN'T
KNOCK DUDES OUT NOW.

38:57.160 --> 39:00.061
- I HEAR THAT.

39:03.900 --> 39:05.504
- LET ME START BY SAYING

39:05.540 --> 39:07.360
THAT EVERYONE DID
AN INCREDIBLE JOB TODAY.

39:07.410 --> 39:10.573
AND THE FACT THAT I FIRED
ALL FOUR CONSULTANTS

39:10.610 --> 39:12.407
AND THEY WENT AHEAD
AND PURSUED THIS CASE ANYWAY

39:12.450 --> 39:14.714
IS SOMETHING THAT
I'M CHOOSING TO FORGET.

39:14.750 --> 39:16.877
HERB WAS A GOOD MAN.

39:16.920 --> 39:18.649
AND IF I WERE IN YOUR SHOES,

39:18.690 --> 39:20.544
I WOULD HAVE DONE
EXACTLY WHAT YOU GUYS DID

39:20.590 --> 39:21.887
AND NEVER GIVEN UP
ON THIS CASE.

39:21.920 --> 39:23.888
- THANK YOU, CHIEF.
- WELL SAID.

39:23.920 --> 39:24.818
- THAT MEANS A LOT.

39:24.860 --> 39:26.384
- SEE I WAS TALKING
TO PETERS AND BOONE.

39:26.430 --> 39:27.488
YOU GUYS SHOULD JUST
STAYED FIRED.

39:27.530 --> 39:29.725
- NAH, SIS, WITHOUT RICK
AND GOOTSY HERE,

39:29.760 --> 39:32.797
FLOYD AND I'D STILL BE
IN THE PARK PLAYING CHECKERS.

39:32.830 --> 39:34.934
- YEAH, THEY WERE THE KICK
IN THE PANTS WE NEEDED.

39:34.970 --> 39:36.562
- GOT A HELL OF A KID HERE,
HENRY.

39:36.600 --> 39:38.966
- YEAH, HE'S ALL RIGHT.

39:39.010 --> 39:41.001
SOMETIMES.

39:41.040 --> 39:43.929
- AND THEN THERE'S YOU.

39:43.980 --> 39:45.470
STANDING TALL,

39:45.510 --> 39:47.899
SHIRT TUCKED IN
A LITTLE TIGHT.

39:47.950 --> 39:50.418
MAYBE A LITTLE TOO TIGHT.

39:50.450 --> 39:51.940
BUT THERE'S CONFIDENCE
IN YOUR EYES,

39:51.990 --> 39:52.911
AND A FIRE IN YOUR LOINS.

39:52.950 --> 39:55.851
YOU KNOW, I'D BE HONORED
TO TAKE YOU IN, GUS,

39:55.890 --> 39:58.882
IF YOU GOT NO PARENTS.

39:58.930 --> 40:01.490
- THAT'S VERY KIND
OF YOU, BOONE.

40:01.530 --> 40:02.929
BUT I DO HAVE PARENTS,

40:02.960 --> 40:06.794
AND I'M IN MY 30$,
SO I THINK I'M GOOD.

40:09.900 --> 40:10.992
- THANK GOD FOR THAT.

40:11.040 --> 40:12.735
I CAN'T BE TAKING IN
NO STRAYS, DON.

40:12.770 --> 40:14.579
- GOT LUCKY THERE, PAL.

40:14.610 --> 40:16.498
RICK.

40:16.540 --> 40:18.701
- WE JUST GOT A CALL
ABOUT A BODY DOWNTOWN

40:18.750 --> 40:20.069
ON TREMONT STREET.

40:20.110 --> 40:22.613
THERE'S SIGNS OF FOUL PLAY.

40:25.690 --> 40:27.783
- YEAH, WHOA.

40:27.820 --> 40:29.082
YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST
THERE EVER WAS,

40:29.120 --> 40:30.781
MAYBE THE BEST
THERE EVER WILL BE,

40:30.820 --> 40:34.927
BUT YOU DO KNOW THIS WAS
A ONE-TIME DEAL, RIGHT?

40:34.960 --> 40:36.825
- RIGHT, HENRY.

40:36.860 --> 40:39.966
- ALL RIGHT.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.729
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH SARALYN?

40:41.770 --> 40:45.536
- I'M GONNA DO EVERYTHING I CAN
TO GET LENIENCY FOR HER.

40:45.570 --> 40:47.606
HERB WAS LOOKING OUT
FOR A GOOD GIRL WITH POTENTIAL,

40:47.640 --> 40:49.039
AND I'LL DO THE SAME.

40:52.680 --> 40:55.547
- ARE THEY--

40:55.580 --> 40:56.808
THOSE SNEAKY--

40:56.850 --> 40:59.011
