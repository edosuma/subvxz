00:10.740 --> 00:12.731
[door opening]

00:15.440 --> 00:16.407
- UNCLE LOU!

00:16.450 --> 00:18.179
- THERE'S MY MAN.

00:18.210 --> 00:19.472
SHAWN, I GOT A NEW ONE
FOR YOU.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.169
WHAT DO POLAR BEARS GET

00:21.220 --> 00:24.246
FROM SITTING ON
THE ICE TOO LONG?

00:24.290 --> 00:26.155
POLAROIDS.

00:26.190 --> 00:27.452
[laughs]

00:27.490 --> 00:29.378
- LOU, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS,

00:29.430 --> 00:30.385
BUT I KNOW IT'S FUNNY.

00:30.430 --> 00:32.489
- [laughing]

00:32.530 --> 00:33.622
- WHAT'S GOIN' ON, DAD?

00:33.660 --> 00:36.094
- HUH? OH, UH, NOTHIN'.

00:36.130 --> 00:37.791
JUST WORK STUFF.

00:37.830 --> 00:39.661
- CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT IT?

00:39.700 --> 00:41.634
- WELL, MAYBE
WHEN YOU'RE A LITTLE OLDER.

00:41.670 --> 00:42.637
- COME ON.

00:42.670 --> 00:43.762
I'M OLD ENOUGH TO DRIVE.

00:43.810 --> 00:45.607
I THINK I CAN HANDLE HEARING
ABOUT ONE OF YOUR CASES.

00:45.640 --> 00:47.505
- SHAWN, YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE
ABLE TO DRIVE FOR THREE YEARS.

00:47.540 --> 00:49.849
- REALLY? THEN HOW WILL GUS
AND I GET TO VEGAS THIS WEEKEND?

00:49.880 --> 00:51.302
- COME ON, HENRY.

00:51.350 --> 00:52.840
HE CAN HANDLE IT.

00:52.880 --> 00:56.213
- FINE, BUT I'M CALLING YOU
WHEN HE CAN'T SLEEP TONIGHT.

00:56.250 --> 00:57.683
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A MISSING GIRL.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.312
- WHAT'S HER NAME?

00:59.360 --> 01:01.157
- VERONICA TOWNE.

01:01.190 --> 01:02.726
- WHERE WAS SHE LAST SEEN?

01:02.760 --> 01:04.227
- THIS BAR
WHERE SHE WAITRESSES

01:04.260 --> 01:05.750
CALLED THE BLUE DERBY.

01:05.790 --> 01:06.757
- WHAT WAS SHE WEARING?

01:06.800 --> 01:07.858
- WHY'S THAT MATI'ER?

01:07.900 --> 01:09.868
- A RED DRESS.

01:09.900 --> 01:11.868
AND A GOLD NECKLACE
WITH HER INITIALS ON IT.

01:11.900 --> 01:14.095
- THAN KS, LOU.

01:14.140 --> 01:15.596
SO DO YOU THINK
SHE WAS MURDERED?

01:15.640 --> 01:17.631
- STARTIN' TO LOOK THAT WAY.

01:20.440 --> 01:22.203
- UH, WHO DO YOU THINK DID IT?

01:22.250 --> 01:24.343
- GUY BY THE NAME
OF JORDAN BEAUMONT,

01:24.380 --> 01:25.574
HER BOSS AT THE BLUE DERBY.

01:25.610 --> 01:28.113
BUT WE CAN'T PROVE IT
UNTIL WE FIND THE PLACE

01:28.150 --> 01:30.345
WHERE HE STASHED THE BODY.

01:30.390 --> 01:32.381
OR PLACES.

01:34.390 --> 01:38.326
- GOTCHA.

01:38.360 --> 01:39.691
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE
ABLE TO SLEEP TONIGHT, ARE YA?

01:39.730 --> 01:40.754
- NOT A WINK.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.325
- THAN KS, LOU.

01:50.440 --> 01:52.704
- SO IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE YOU'VE GIVEN ME AN UPDATE

01:52.740 --> 01:53.809
ON YOU AND JULES.

01:53.840 --> 01:54.829
- OH, I'M SORRY, BUDDY.

01:54.880 --> 01:55.835
WE'RE DOIN' GREAT.

01:55.880 --> 01:57.472
AND CAN I TELL YOU WHY?
- WHY?

01:57.510 --> 01:59.444
- WE'RE DONE STRESSING ABOUT
WHEN WE'RE MOVING IN TOGETHER,

01:59.480 --> 02:00.617
GETI'ING MARRIED.

02:00.650 --> 02:01.719
WE BOTH KNOW
THAT'S NOT HAPPENING

02:01.750 --> 02:02.739
UNTIL WAY DOWN THE LINE.

02:02.790 --> 02:03.848
- I HEAR THAT.

02:03.890 --> 02:05.448
- AFI'ER RETIREMENT
AND MENOPAUSE.

02:05.490 --> 02:07.685
NOW, WE CAN JUST RELAX
AND ENJOY EACH OTHER.

02:07.720 --> 02:10.621
OH! AND WE FOUND THIS AMAZING
BOOK CALLED THE KAMA SUTRA.

02:10.660 --> 02:11.422
- WHAT?

02:11.460 --> 02:12.392
- ILLUSTRATIONS
ARE ILLUMINATING.

02:12.430 --> 02:14.557
THERE'S ONE CALLED
"CONGRESS OF THE RHINO."

02:14.600 --> 02:15.589
- SHAWN!

02:20.500 --> 02:23.401
I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY
TO SEE A DEAD PERSON IN MY LIFE.

02:23.440 --> 02:24.737
- JULES!

02:24.770 --> 02:25.532
WHAT DO WE GOT?

02:25.570 --> 02:27.379
- UNIDENTIFIED MALE
FOUND DEAD.

02:27.410 --> 02:28.536
GUNSHOT WOUND TO THE FACE.

02:28.580 --> 02:31.276
- OUCH.
- WHO'S THE BIG, SCARY GUY?

02:31.310 --> 02:33.449
- CARLTON LASSITER.
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT BY NOW.

02:33.480 --> 02:34.777
- HE'S THE FOREMAN
ON THE CONSTRUCTION SITE.

02:34.820 --> 02:37.539
HE'S THE ONE
WHO FOUND THE BODY.

02:37.590 --> 02:39.410
- I GO'I'I'A TELL YOU,
MR. MONTERO,

02:39.460 --> 02:40.757
YOUR STORY,
MUCH LIKE YOUR LUNCHBOX--

02:40.790 --> 02:41.859
SMELLS A LITTLE FISHY.

02:41.890 --> 02:43.721
I MEAN,
YOU'RE DIGGIN' OVER HERE.

02:43.760 --> 02:46.194
YOU FIND THE BODY
WAY OVER THERE.

02:46.230 --> 02:47.424
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

02:47.460 --> 02:49.155
- I HAD TO TAKE A LEAK.

02:50.530 --> 02:52.464
- SO AFTER YOU FOUND THE BODY,
THEN WHAT'D YOU DO?

02:52.500 --> 02:54.491
- I REALLY HAD TO TAKE A LEAK.

02:56.540 --> 02:58.531
- WE'RE GONNA NEED TO INTERVIEW
THE REST OF YOUR CREW.

03:01.580 --> 03:03.445
- STOP!

03:03.480 --> 03:04.447
STOP!

03:04.480 --> 03:05.742
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:05.780 --> 03:08.442
- I'M SENSING THERE'S
SOMETHING IN THERE.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.482
- WELL, WHAT IS IT, SHAWN?

03:13.790 --> 03:17.328
- WHAT THE HELL?

03:22.430 --> 03:23.397
- WHAT WAS SHE WEARING?

03:23.430 --> 03:25.466
- A RED DRESS.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.468
AND A GOLD NECKLACE
WITH HER INITIALS ON IT.

03:34.480 --> 03:37.847
- I'M SO NOT SLEEPING
TONIGHT.

03:37.880 --> 03:40.849
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

03:40.880 --> 03:45.419
*

03:45.450 --> 03:48.419
- * IN BETWEEN THE LINES
THERE'S A LOT OF OBSCURITY *

03:48.460 --> 03:52.294
* I'M NOT INCLINED
TO RESIGN TO MATURITY *

03:52.330 --> 03:53.820
* IF IT'S ALL RIGHT

03:53.860 --> 03:55.657
* THEN YOU'RE ALL WRONG

03:55.700 --> 03:59.295
* BUT WHY BOUNCE AROUND
TO THE SAME DAMN SONG? *

03:59.340 --> 04:00.932
-*OOH

04:00.970 --> 04:04.337
- * YOU'D RATHER RUN
WHEN YOU CAN'T CRAWL *

04:04.370 --> 04:06.679

04:06.710 --> 04:10.578
* I KNOW YOU KNOW THAT
I'M NOT TELLING THE TRUTH *

04:10.610 --> 04:12.919

JUST DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF *

[crowd chatter]

04:30.330 --> 04:31.297
- STEP ASIDE, PLEASE.

04:31.330 --> 04:33.434
- CHIEF VICK,
IS THERE ANY TRUTH TO THE RUMORS

04:33.470 --> 04:34.494
THAT ONE OF THE BODIES
FOUND YESTERDAY

04:34.540 --> 04:35.768
BELONGS TO VERONICA TOWNE?

04:35.800 --> 04:37.563
- I HAVE NO COMMENT
ON THAT AT THIS TIME.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.635
- HAS ANYONE
IN HER FAMILY BEEN CONTACTED?

04:39.680 --> 04:41.568
- I WILL PASS ALONG ALL INFO
AS IT BECOMES AVAILABLE.

04:41.610 --> 04:42.577
THANK YOU.

04:42.610 --> 04:44.305
- WHEN CAN WE EXPECT
A STATEMENT, CHIEF VICK?

04:44.350 --> 04:45.908
[crowd chatter]
- CHIEF VICK!

04:45.950 --> 04:48.339
- DON'T HAVE AN I.D.
ON THIS FELLA YET,

04:48.380 --> 04:51.543
BUT I BELIEVE HIS TIME OF DEATH
WAS APPROXIMATELY 6:00 PM.

04:51.590 --> 04:52.557
ON THE DAY IN QUESTION.

04:52.590 --> 04:54.012
NOW, AS FOR THIS ONE,

04:54.060 --> 04:58.656
SHAWN'S HUNCH ABOUT IT BEING
VERONICA TOWNE WAS SPOT-ON.

04:58.690 --> 05:01.523
YEAH, SHE WAS QUITE A LOOKER.

05:01.560 --> 05:04.324
STILL IS.

05:04.370 --> 05:06.838
ANYWAY, ALL THE RECORDS MATCH.

05:06.870 --> 05:09.566
HER SHOES AND DRESS, HOWEVER?

05:09.610 --> 05:11.566
NOT SO MUCH.
[chuckles]

05:11.610 --> 05:12.804
- [sighs]

05:12.840 --> 05:14.330
- SORRY. SORRY.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.007
I CAN BE A REAL BITCH
SOMETIMES.

05:16.040 --> 05:17.701
- HOW DID SHE DIE?

05:17.750 --> 05:19.672
- WELL, MY FIRST GUESS WAS
SMALLPOX, BUT IT TURNS OUT

05:19.720 --> 05:21.347
SHE HAD NONE OF THE SYMPTOMS.

05:21.380 --> 05:23.780
PLUS, SMALLPOX APPARENTLY WAS
ERADICATED ABOUT 40 YEARS AGO.

05:23.820 --> 05:24.787
WHO KNEW? [laughs]

05:24.820 --> 05:26.685
NOT ME.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.381
[low]
NOT ME.

05:28.420 --> 05:30.729
BUT, BASED ON
THE FRACTURE TO HER NECK,

05:30.760 --> 05:32.694
I'M GOING TO SAY
SHE WAS STRANGLED TO DEATH.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.022
- JORDAN BEAUMONT DID THIS.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.469
- WHO'S JORDAN BEAUMONT?

05:38.500 --> 05:39.592
- HER BOSS.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.790
THE BAR SHE WORKED AT,
THE BLUE DERBY.

05:41.840 --> 05:42.807
- THAT'S RIGHT, SHAWN.

05:42.840 --> 05:45.365
HE WAS ALSO HER BOYFRIEND
AND A REAL S.O.B.

05:45.410 --> 05:46.809
HE WAS SEEN PUSHING HER
AROUND IN A PARKING LOT

05:46.840 --> 05:48.569
A COUPLE OF HOURS
BEFORE SHE VANISHED.

05:48.610 --> 05:49.907
- HOW DO YOU KNOW
SO MUCH ABOUT THIS CASE?

05:49.950 --> 05:51.599
- BECAUSE I WAS
THE LEAD DETECTIVE,

05:51.650 --> 05:53.140
ALONG WITH MY PARTNER
AT THE TIME, LOU GAMBLE.

05:53.180 --> 05:55.114
- MAY HE REST IN PEACE.

05:55.150 --> 05:56.014
SWEET OLD UNCLE LOU

05:56.050 --> 05:57.711
HAD A THOUSAND JOKES
ABOUT HEMORRHOIDS.

05:57.750 --> 05:58.739
THEY WERE ALL HILARIOUS.

05:58.790 --> 06:01.111
- JORDAN WAS OUR
LEAD SUSPECT THE ENTIRE TIME.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.479
- SO WHY COULDN'T YOU GET HIM?

06:02.530 --> 06:03.986
- NEVER GOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.679
- SO WHY COULDN'T YOU GET HIM?

06:05.730 --> 06:07.595
- BEAUMONT,
WHY DO I KNOW THAT NAME?

06:07.630 --> 06:08.756
- 'CAUSE HIS FATHER ELLIS

06:08.800 --> 06:10.961
IS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL
AND POWERFUL BUSINESSMEN

06:11.000 --> 06:12.069
IN ALL OF SANTA BARBARA.

06:12.100 --> 06:14.694
- YOU MEAN HE WAS.

06:14.740 --> 06:16.731
WE JUST GOT AN I.D.
ON THIS BODY.

06:19.170 --> 06:21.730
- SO NOW I'VE GOT TWO BODIES:

06:21.780 --> 06:23.145
THE GIRL WHO'S BEEN
MISSING FOR 20 YEARS

06:23.180 --> 06:25.444
AND THE FATHER OF THE MAN
LONG SUSPECTED OF KILLING HER.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.175
DO YOU HAVE
ANY OTHER BOMBSHELLS FOR ME?

06:27.220 --> 06:28.869
- DID YOU SEE THE FINALE
OF THE BACHELORETI'E?

06:28.920 --> 06:30.717
- YES.
- THEN NO, I DO NOT.

06:30.750 --> 06:32.615
- OUR THEORY IS THAT
JORDAN BEAUMONT

06:32.660 --> 06:34.116
KILLED VERONICA TOWNE
20 YEARS AGO

06:34.160 --> 06:35.684
AND RECENTLY OFFED HIS FATHER.

06:35.720 --> 06:37.551
DUMPED HIS BODY
IN THE SAME SPOT.

06:37.590 --> 06:39.148
- WHY WOULD JORDAN BURY
ONE BODY AND NOT THE OTHER?

06:39.190 --> 06:40.623
- MAYBE IT WAS SOME WEIRD
ADMISSION OF GUILT.

06:40.660 --> 06:41.649
- AH.

06:41.700 --> 06:42.621
KINDA LIKE GUS ADMITI'ING
THAT HE LIKES CAT FOOD.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.865
- I SAID I LIKE
HOW IT LOOKS IN COMMERCIALS.

06:44.900 --> 06:45.662
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

06:45.700 --> 06:47.759
- NO, THERE IS NOT
A DIFFERENCE.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.734
- I WANT JORDAN TRACKED DOWN
AND QUESTIONED IMMEDIATELY.

06:49.770 --> 06:51.101
SHAWN AND GUS,
YOU'RE ON THIS AS WELL.

06:51.140 --> 06:52.107
- KAREN.

06:52.140 --> 06:53.505
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

06:53.540 --> 06:54.609
- I'D LIKE YOU TO SERVE
IN YOUR USUAL ROLE.

06:54.640 --> 06:57.473
- YOU KNOW, CROSSWORDS,
AIR-BOMBING THE MEN'S ROOM.

06:57.510 --> 06:59.171
- I THINK I SHOULD
ALSO WORK THE CASE.

06:59.210 --> 07:00.814
- AS WHAT? A DETECTIVE?

07:00.850 --> 07:02.511
- NOBODY KNOWS IT
BETTER THAN I DO.

07:02.550 --> 07:03.949
YOU COULD REINSTATE ME.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.787
THIS ONE TIME.
- COME ON, HENRY.

07:05.820 --> 07:07.708
ALL DUE RESPECT, YOU CAN'T
JUST HOP BACK IN THE GAME

07:07.760 --> 07:08.658
AFI'ER ALL THESE YEARS.

07:08.690 --> 07:10.226
THERE'S BEEN
A LOT OF CHANGES ON THE JOB.

07:10.260 --> 07:11.227
- LASSIE'S RIGHT.

07:11.260 --> 07:12.557
FOR EXAMPLE, THE BICYCLE?

07:12.600 --> 07:14.022
IT'S NO LONGER
JUST ONE GIANT WHEEL

07:14.060 --> 07:15.129
WITH A TINY ONE IN BACK.

07:15.160 --> 07:16.798
- AND NOW, MY PEOPLE CAN VOTE.

07:16.830 --> 07:18.468
- KAREN, I PROMISE YOU
I CAN HANDLE THIS THING.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.661
PLUS, I OWE IT TO LOU GAMBLE
TO SOLVE THIS CASE.

07:20.700 --> 07:21.667
COME ON.

07:21.700 --> 07:24.760
LET ME FINISH WHAT I STARTED.

07:24.810 --> 07:26.801
- OKAY.
- OKAY?

07:26.840 --> 07:28.068
OKAY, CHIEF, I DON'T THINK

07:28.110 --> 07:29.475
YOU'RE THINKING THIS
ALL THE WAY THROUGH.

07:29.510 --> 07:30.704
- I'M GOING TO JORDAN'S HOUSE.

07:30.750 --> 07:31.842
I THINK HE STILL LIVES
AT HIS PARENTS' ESTATE.

07:31.880 --> 07:34.849
YOU TWO SHOULD GO TO THE CLUB
HE OWNS ON 26TH STREET.

07:34.880 --> 07:35.949
- WHA?

07:35.980 --> 07:39.655
- OKAY, SO DO WE GO
WITH YOUR DAD OR WITH LASSIE?

07:39.690 --> 07:42.989
- WORST. OPTIONS. EVER.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.193
- WILL YOU RELAX?

07:48.230 --> 07:49.527
YOU ACT LIKE THIS IS
THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE EVER

07:49.570 --> 07:50.798
WORKED WITH YOUR DAD.

07:50.830 --> 07:51.922
- HOW 'BOUT YOU RELAX, HUH?
HOW 'BOUT THAT?

07:51.970 --> 07:53.494
- I AM RELAXED.

07:53.540 --> 07:54.837
- IT'S USUALLY
FROM A DISTANCE, MAN.

07:54.870 --> 07:56.633
I'M HAVING FLASHBACKS
TO THE TIME HE CHAPERONED

07:56.670 --> 07:57.807
OUR EIGHTH-GRADE FIELD TRIP.

07:57.840 --> 07:58.864
- OOH, I REMEMBER THAT.

07:58.910 --> 08:00.707
HE KEPT UNDOING HIS PANTS
TO TUCK IN HIS SHIRT.

08:00.740 --> 08:01.775
- IT WAS HORRIFYING.

08:01.810 --> 08:02.879
NOW, HE'S 20 YEARS WEIRDER

08:02.910 --> 08:05.743
AND, THIS TIME,
HE'S CARRYING A GUN.

08:05.780 --> 08:07.714
- [laughs]

08:07.750 --> 08:10.742
DETECTIVE SPENCER.

08:10.790 --> 08:12.781
BEEN A WHILE.

08:14.790 --> 08:16.781
SO WHERE'S LOU?

08:16.830 --> 08:18.752
- HE DIED OF A HEART A'I'I'ACK
FOUR YEARS AGO.

08:18.790 --> 08:21.623
- SHOCKING. HE TOOK
SUCH GOOD CARE OF HIMSELF.

08:21.660 --> 08:22.820
- HEY. HEY.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.861
EASY. EASY, SIPOWICZ.

08:24.900 --> 08:28.131
- GENTLEMEN, THE TIMING
OF YOUR VISIT IS NOT IDEAL.

08:28.170 --> 08:31.207
AS YOU MAY KNOW, MY CLIENT'S
FATHER HAS JUST PASSED AWAY

08:31.240 --> 08:33.231
AND HE HAS ARRANGEMENTS
TO MAKE.

08:35.680 --> 08:36.772
- LIKE WHAT?

08:36.810 --> 08:38.846
LIKE, UH, RENOVATING THE
GIANT HOUSE HE JUST INHERITED?

08:38.880 --> 08:39.847
- WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

08:39.880 --> 08:40.949
- WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS?

08:40.980 --> 08:42.845
- LOOK, YOU CLEARLY THINK
THAT I KILLED MY FATHER.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.949
- OH, YEAH?

08:44.990 --> 08:46.287
ACTUALLY,
I FORGOT WHAT MY POINT WAS,

08:46.320 --> 08:47.787
BUT WHAT YOU JUST SAID
MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.

08:47.820 --> 08:49.856
- EXCUSE ME, WHO ARE YOU?

08:49.890 --> 08:51.926
- SHAWN SPENCER.

08:51.960 --> 08:52.949
THAT IS MY PARTNER,
SH'DYNASTY.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.992
IT IS SPELLED S-H--
COMMA TO THE TOP--DYNASTY.

08:56.030 --> 08:57.759
- COMMA TO THE TOP?

08:57.800 --> 08:58.926
- THAT'S GOD'S COMMA.

08:58.970 --> 09:00.892
- AND I AM
A BADASS PSYCHIC DETECTIVE,

09:00.940 --> 09:02.567
JACK FON SWOO.

09:02.610 --> 09:03.565
- HE'S ALSO MY SON.

09:03.610 --> 09:04.668
- DAD.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.701
YOU TOOK THE TEETH RIGHT OUT
OF MY "BADASS" COMMENT.

09:06.740 --> 09:09.709
- I'D BE VERY CAREFUL
HOW YOU TREAD HERE, GENTLEMEN.

09:09.750 --> 09:12.776
WE WILL NOT STAND FOR
FURTHER LIBELOUS ACCUSATIONS

09:12.820 --> 09:14.708
LIKE THE ONES RELATED
TO VERONICA TOWNE.

09:14.750 --> 09:16.274
- OH, YOU MEAN
THE WOMAN WE FOUND DEAD

09:16.320 --> 09:19.039
3O YARDS FROM HIS FATHER?

09:19.090 --> 09:20.910
YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT.

09:20.960 --> 09:24.179
YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY
ABOUT THAT, SMARTASS?

09:24.230 --> 09:25.720
- SMALL WORLD?

09:25.760 --> 09:26.920
FOR THE RECORD,

09:26.960 --> 09:29.258
I WAS AT MY GIRLFRIEND
THEA'S ALL LAST NIGHT.

09:29.300 --> 09:31.120
- OH, THAT'S NICE.
THAT'S SWEET.

09:31.170 --> 09:33.161
DO YOU HAVE AN ADDRESS
FOR THIS THEA?

09:35.800 --> 09:38.234
- GENTLEMEN, MY CLIENT IS
UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO ANSWER

09:38.270 --> 09:39.931
ANY QUESTIONS FROM YOU.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.868
NOW, I'LL HAVE TO ASK
THAT YOU LEAVE.

09:41.910 --> 09:42.877
IMMEDIATELY.

09:42.910 --> 09:44.275
- TAKE IT EASY, KAT VON D.

09:44.310 --> 09:45.709
KNOW THIS, JORDAN.

09:45.750 --> 09:46.774
I'M ON TO YOU.

09:46.820 --> 09:49.118
LIKE FAT...

09:49.150 --> 09:50.117
ON A FAT PERSON.

09:50.150 --> 09:51.378
- [laughs]
PLEASE.

09:51.420 --> 09:52.956
YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND
ANYTHING ON ME, SHAWN.

09:52.990 --> 09:54.059
- WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE?

09:54.090 --> 09:57.059
- BECAUSE THE APPLE DOES NOT
FALL FAR FROM THE TREE.

09:59.960 --> 10:01.951
- GENTLEMEN.

10:04.230 --> 10:05.026
- MAN.

10:05.070 --> 10:06.867
I WANT TO PUNCH
THAT SMARMY BASTARD,

10:06.900 --> 10:10.006
AND THEN LAUGH IN HIS HANDSOME,
ETHNICALLY-NEUTRAL FACE.

10:10.040 --> 10:13.009
- NO ONE WANTS TO NAIL
THIS GUY'S ASS MORE THAN I DO.

10:13.040 --> 10:15.634
SORRY. I'M A LITTLE RUSTY
ON MY COP TALK.

10:15.680 --> 10:16.908
- WHAT ARE WE
DOIN' HERE ANYWAY, SHAWN?

10:16.950 --> 10:18.770
- LOOKIN' FOR ROOM 207.

10:18.810 --> 10:19.947
IT WAS THE NUMBER
ON HIS VALET TICKET

10:19.980 --> 10:22.881
DATED SATURDAY NIGHT.

10:22.920 --> 10:25.912
YOU SEE? HE WASN'T
AT HIS GIRLFRIEND THEA'S.

10:28.420 --> 10:31.321
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
THEA LIVES HERE.

10:31.360 --> 10:32.384
- MAY I HELP YOU?

10:32.430 --> 10:34.898
- THEA SUMMERS, WE NEED
TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS

10:34.930 --> 10:35.954
ABOUT JORDAN BEAUMONT.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.992
- FUN. I LOVE BOY TALK.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.168
- JORDAN DEFINITELY
HAS A TYPE.

10:43.210 --> 10:44.438
- OH, YES, HE DOES.

10:44.470 --> 10:47.030
- FEEL FREE TO HELP YOURSELF
TO THE MINIBAR.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.877
- I HAVE BEEN WAITING
MY ENTIRE LIFE

10:48.910 --> 10:50.104
TO HEAR THOSE EXACT WORDS.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.208
- OOH!

10:52.950 --> 10:55.248
- I'M SO GLAD I QUIT
THAT STUPID CLEANSE TODAY.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.781
- SO, THEA,
YOU'VE BEEN HERE A WHILE.

10:56.820 --> 10:58.048
- ABOUT THREE WEEKS.

10:58.090 --> 10:59.318
- NICE PLACE.

10:59.350 --> 11:02.148
- I GUESS, IF YOU LIKE GREEN.

11:02.190 --> 11:03.885
[candy wrappers crinkling]

11:03.930 --> 11:05.022
- DUDE!

11:05.060 --> 11:06.027
HAVE SOME RESPECT
FOR YOURSELF.

11:06.060 --> 11:08.722
- SUCK IT, SHAWN.

11:08.760 --> 11:11.695
- SO I GUESS DATING JORDAN
HAS ITS PERKS, HUH?

11:11.730 --> 11:13.994
- I'D SAY WE'RE MORE
"SEEING EACH OTHER."

11:14.040 --> 11:16.361
I SAVE THE "D" WORD
FOR GUYS I'M SLEEPING WITH.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.061
- REALLY? NO WHOOPIE?

11:18.110 --> 11:19.998
NO HANKY-PANK
IN THE NIGHTY-NIGHT?

11:20.040 --> 11:21.735
NO DARK DANCING?

11:21.780 --> 11:22.872
SO WHAT DOES A GUY GET
FOR PU'I'I'ING YOU UP

11:22.910 --> 11:23.706
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?

11:23.750 --> 11:26.913
- A STEP CLOSER
TO SLEEPING WITH ME.

11:32.050 --> 11:35.019
- DAD!

11:35.060 --> 11:35.913
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:35.960 --> 11:37.188
- JUST GO'I'I'A QUICKLY
TUCK IN MY SHIRT.

11:37.230 --> 11:40.927
- THAT IS EASILY ACCOMPLISHED
WITHOUT UNBUTI'ONING YOUR PANTS.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.188
THIS IS MY FIELD TRIP
ALL OVER AGAIN.

11:42.230 --> 11:44.118
- DO YOU MIND IF I STEP OUTSIDE
FOR A CIGARETTE?

11:44.170 --> 11:46.161
- COURSE NOT.
GO AHEAD. JUST--

11:49.070 --> 11:52.733
[film noir music]

11:52.780 --> 11:55.772
- I CAN TELL YOU'RE NOT A FAN
OF WORKING WITH YOUR FATHER.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.301
- HOW DID YOU KNOW HE--

11:59.350 --> 12:01.409
- YOU HAVE THE SAME EYES.

12:01.450 --> 12:05.409
DON'T WORRY.
I'M NO STRANGER TO DADDY ISSUES.

12:05.450 --> 12:10.456
- THAT PHOTO IN YOUR BAG
SUGGESTS OTHERWISE.

12:10.490 --> 12:12.378
- IT WAS A HAPPIER TIME.

12:12.430 --> 12:15.319
HAVE YOU ALWAYS
BEEN SUCH A SNOOP?

12:15.360 --> 12:17.021
- OH, YEAH.

12:17.070 --> 12:17.991
HENCE, MY NICKNAME
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

12:18.030 --> 12:19.019
- SNOOPY?

12:19.070 --> 12:21.368
- HAMMER TIME.

12:21.400 --> 12:24.836
WHERE'D YOU LIVE
BEFORE THE BEAUMONT?

12:24.870 --> 12:27.430
- MICHIGAN.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.799
MOVED TO SANTA BARBARA

12:28.840 --> 12:31.479
THREE WEEKS AGO
TO GET AWAY FROM THE COLD.

12:31.510 --> 12:32.977
I PLANNED ON
STAYING THE NIGHT,

12:33.020 --> 12:34.942
BUT THEN I MET JORDAN

12:34.980 --> 12:36.117
AND HE STARTED COMPING ME.

12:36.150 --> 12:38.038
- WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HIM?

12:38.090 --> 12:39.284
- LAST NIGHT.

12:39.320 --> 12:41.379
WE STAYED IN
AND WATCHED SUMMER SCHOOL.

12:41.420 --> 12:42.352
PRETI'Y LAM E, RIGHT?

12:42.390 --> 12:46.224
- YEAH, IF YOU HATE
CINEMATIC PERFECTION.

12:46.260 --> 12:47.295
SKI SCHOOL WAS ON
BEFORE THAT.

12:47.330 --> 12:48.354
DID YOU GUYS WATCH SKI SCHOOL?

12:48.400 --> 12:50.061
- NO.

12:50.100 --> 12:53.160
JORDAN ARRIVED JUST AS
SUMMER SCHOOL WAS STARTING.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.436
- HELLO, EVERYONE.

13:01.480 --> 13:04.574
GREAT TO BE BACK.

13:04.610 --> 13:05.804
- ENJOY YOUR STAY.

13:05.850 --> 13:07.909
- CHIEF, I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE
TO ELBOW HIM IN THE STERNUM.

13:07.950 --> 13:09.110
- PLEASE DO.

13:09.150 --> 13:12.017
- ESTIMATED TIME OF DEATH
FOR ELLIS BEAUMONT IS 6:00 PM.

13:12.050 --> 13:14.109
JORDAN ARRIVED AT THE HOTEL
JUST AS SUMMER SCHOOL

13:14.160 --> 13:15.081
WAS STARTING, AT 9:00,

13:15.120 --> 13:17.259
WHICH IS TRUE
BECAUSE I WAS WATCHING TOO.

13:17.290 --> 13:19.178
NOBODY PAINTS A SCENE
LIKE DEAN CAMERON.

13:19.230 --> 13:20.254
- HE'S "CHAINSAW," RIGHT?

13:20.300 --> 13:21.528
- THAT'S RIGHT, CHIEF.

13:21.560 --> 13:24.063
- SO THAT LEAVES
A THREE-HOUR GAP IN HIS ALIBI.

13:24.100 --> 13:25.419
- WELL, IT'S THIN,
BUT IT'S ENOUGH

13:25.470 --> 13:27.495
TO HOLD HIM FOR QUESTIONING.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.189
WHAT IS UP WITH MR. GUSTER?

13:29.240 --> 13:30.104
[snoring]

13:30.140 --> 13:32.005
- SUGAR CRASH.

13:32.040 --> 13:35.203
HE JUST ATE $600 WORTH OF CANDY
FROM THE HOTEL MINIBAR.

13:35.240 --> 13:37.140
- SHAWN.

13:37.180 --> 13:38.875
I'VE BEEN LOOKIN' ALL OVER
FOR YOU, NOW LISTEN.

13:38.910 --> 13:40.969
WE FOUND ANOTHER PERSON'S
DNA ON VERONICA TOWNE.

13:41.020 --> 13:42.271
WE RAN SOME TESTS.
WE HAVE A MATCH.

13:42.320 --> 13:44.208
- GREAT.
- LET ME GUESS.

13:44.250 --> 13:45.387
JORDAN BEAUMONT.
- NO.

13:45.420 --> 13:48.389
THE NAME THAT CAME UP WAS...

13:48.420 --> 13:50.081
LOU GAMBLE.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.555
LET ME SEE THAT.

13:52.590 --> 13:54.194
- UNCLE LOU?

13:59.630 --> 14:01.063
- THERE'S NO WAY THAT
LOU GAMBLE HAD ANYTHING TO DO

14:01.100 --> 14:02.089
WITH VERONICA TOWNE'S DEATH.

14:02.140 --> 14:03.960
- THEN WHAT WAS HIS DNA
DOIN' ALL OVER HER BODY?

14:04.010 --> 14:04.760
- I DON'T KNOW.

14:04.810 --> 14:06.038
MAYBE IT WAS
A MIX-UP IN THE LAB,

14:06.070 --> 14:07.105
SOMEBODY TRIED TO SET HIM UP,

14:07.140 --> 14:08.129
IT DOESN'T MA'I'I'ER.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.239
LOU WAS A GREAT COP,
AND HE WAS AS DECENT A GUY

14:10.280 --> 14:11.349
AS YOU'LL FIND.

14:11.380 --> 14:13.473
- HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T SEEM
LIKE THE MURDERING TYPE.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.442
THEN AGAIN, NEITHER DID
MA'ITHEW MCCONAUGHEY'S CHARACTER

14:15.480 --> 14:16.469
IN THE LINCOLN LAWYER.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.442
- RYAN PHILLIPPE
WAS THE MURDERER IN THAT MOVIE.

14:18.490 --> 14:20.481
- REALLY? I NEVER SAW IT.

14:22.260 --> 14:23.625
- HENRY SPENCER!

14:23.660 --> 14:24.627
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

14:24.660 --> 14:26.651
- AW, IT'S GREAT
TO SEE YA, BEA.

14:26.690 --> 14:29.056
HEY, YOU REMEMBER MY SON,
SHAWN, DON'T YA?

14:29.100 --> 14:30.067
- OF COURSE.

14:30.100 --> 14:31.397
- HI, BEA.

14:31.430 --> 14:33.193
- LAST TIME I SAW YOU,
YOU WERE PRACTICALLY IN TEARS

14:33.240 --> 14:35.435
BECAUSE YOUR DAD WOULDN'T
BUY YOU AN ICE CREAM.

14:35.470 --> 14:37.358
WHEN WAS THAT, HENRY?

14:37.410 --> 14:39.469
- SIX YEARS AGO.

14:39.510 --> 14:43.002
- THESE WERE THE BEST YEARS
OF LOU'S LIFE.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.506
WORKING WITH YOU,
JACK, AND JERRY.

14:44.550 --> 14:47.576
- YEAH. WELL,
WE WERE QUITE A TEAM.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.110
YOU KNOW, BACK IN THOSE DAYS,

14:49.150 --> 14:51.345
HONOR AND RESPECT
FOR THE BADGE MEANT SOMETHING.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.358
- WORST BOY BAND EVER.

14:53.390 --> 14:54.357
- [whistles]

14:54.390 --> 14:55.516
- DO YOU ALL STILL
KEEP IN TOUCH?

14:55.560 --> 14:56.515
- OCCASIONALLY.

14:56.560 --> 14:57.686
JACK STILL LIVES IN TOWN.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.028
JERRY HAS A PLACE UP NORTH.

15:00.060 --> 15:01.925
I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO HASN'T RETIRED.

15:01.960 --> 15:02.927
- HE MEANS PHYSICALLY.

15:02.970 --> 15:04.323
MENTALLY, IT'S NAPTIME, BEA.

15:04.370 --> 15:07.237
- 'SCUSE ME, DO YOU MIND
IF I HAVE SOME OF THIS CANDY?

15:07.270 --> 15:08.965
- OF COURSE, DEAR.
- THANK YOU.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.662
- YOU HAVE A PROBLEM,
CANDYMAN.

15:11.710 --> 15:14.531
- I MAKE THE WORLD TASTE GOOD.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.275
- BEA, BACK IN '91,
DO YOU REMEMBER HEARING

15:16.310 --> 15:19.404
JACK TALK ABOUT A CASE INVOLVING
THE NAME VERONICA TOWNE?

15:19.450 --> 15:20.610
- NO.

15:20.650 --> 15:22.675
HE RARELY TALKED TO ME
ABOUT ANY OF HIS CASES.

15:22.720 --> 15:24.540
- DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING
STRANGE ABOUT HIS BEHAVIOR

15:24.590 --> 15:25.579
AT THE TIME?

15:25.620 --> 15:27.554
PLEASE, THIS IS IMPORTANT.

15:27.590 --> 15:29.319
- WELL, LET'S SEE.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.225
[muttering]
'91.

15:31.260 --> 15:32.522
WELL, THERE WERE THE CALLS.

15:32.560 --> 15:33.720
- WHAT CALLS?

15:33.760 --> 15:37.469
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

15:37.500 --> 15:38.626
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

15:38.670 --> 15:40.467
YOU JUST CRASHED
AT THE POLICE STATION.

15:40.500 --> 15:42.195
- PLAYAS DON'T CRASH, SHAWN.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.629
THEY REST THEIR EYES,
AND THEN THEY REFUEL.

15:44.670 --> 15:46.228
- BURTON!

15:46.270 --> 15:47.999
- FOR ABOUT A WEEK,
I WOULD GET THESE CALLS

15:48.040 --> 15:50.349
WHEN I WAS ALONE FROM A MAN
WITH A DEEP, RASPY VOICE,

15:50.380 --> 15:51.608
AND HE'D SAY THINGS LIKE,

15:51.650 --> 15:53.675
"HOW'S YOUR DAY GOING, BEA?"
THEN HANG UP.

15:53.720 --> 15:57.247
I DIDN'T REALLY START TO GET
SCARED UNTIL THESE SHOWED UP.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.282
THESE WAS WAITIN' FOR ME ON
MY CAR WINDSHIELD ONE AFTERNOON.

16:01.390 --> 16:02.550
- DID LOU EVER SEE THESE?

16:02.590 --> 16:04.626
- YES, BUT HE
JUST SAID TO IGNORE THEM

16:04.660 --> 16:06.480
AND THEN HE PLACED
THE PHOTOS IN THE TRASH.

16:06.530 --> 16:09.158
I IMMEDIATELY FISHED THEM OUT
AND KEPT THEM, JUST TO BE SAFE.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.690
- WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT?

16:10.730 --> 16:11.697
- NOTHIN'.

16:11.730 --> 16:13.368
NO MORE CALLS, PHOTOS.

16:13.400 --> 16:16.233
BUT LOU'S BEHAVIOR DID
STRIKE ME AS A BIT STRANGE.

16:16.270 --> 16:18.409
BUT THEN I JUST ASSUMED
IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE STRESS

16:18.440 --> 16:19.668
OF WORKING TWO JOBS.

16:19.710 --> 16:20.677
- TWO JOBS?

16:20.710 --> 16:23.770
W-W-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

16:23.810 --> 16:27.075
- HE WAS TOO PROUD
TO TELL YOU.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.315
I HAD SOME MEDICAL ISSUES
AT THE TIME, SO HE PICKED UP

16:29.350 --> 16:33.389
AN OFF-DUTY SECURITY JOB
TO HELP PAY THE BILLS.

16:33.420 --> 16:34.512
- DO YOU REMEMBER WHERE?

16:34.560 --> 16:36.585
- YES.

16:36.620 --> 16:38.622
THE BLUE DERBY.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.363
- I CAME HERE TWICE
TO INTERVIEW THE STAFF

16:45.400 --> 16:46.799
AFTER VERONICA'S
DISAPPEARANCE.

16:46.830 --> 16:48.661
BOTH TIMES,
LOU CALLED IN SICK.

16:48.700 --> 16:50.702
- YEAH, HE WAS DEFINITELY
HIDING SOMETHING.

16:50.740 --> 16:51.604
- WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

16:51.640 --> 16:53.176
- WELL, BACK THEN,
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE

16:53.210 --> 16:55.337
'305, SMOKY-STYLE PIANO BARS,

16:55.380 --> 16:58.144
COMPLETE WITH RED BOOTHS AND
WAITRESSES IN SKIMPY OUTFITS.

16:58.180 --> 17:01.172
[soft blues piano]

17:02.180 --> 17:04.489
- I CAN SEE
TIMES HAVE CHANGED.

17:07.520 --> 17:09.317
- DETECTIVE SPENCER, RIGHT?

17:09.360 --> 17:10.759
- IDA LANE.

17:10.790 --> 17:13.429
I THOUGHT YOU WOULDA FOUND
A DIFFERENT LINE OF WORK BY NOW.

17:13.460 --> 17:15.189
- I WAS ABOUT TO SAY
THE SAME THING TO YOU.

17:15.230 --> 17:17.425
_ THIS IS MY SON, SHAWN,
AND HIS PARTNER, GUS.

17:17.470 --> 17:18.425
- HELLO.

17:18.470 --> 17:19.425
- NICE.

17:19.470 --> 17:20.835
I VOTED AGAINST PROP 8.

17:20.870 --> 17:23.600
- [scoffs] WE'RE PARTNERS
IN A DETECTIVE AGENCY.

17:23.640 --> 17:24.766
- OH.

17:24.810 --> 17:25.799
- BUT WE'RE ALSO LOVERS
IN THE NIGH'I'TIME.

17:25.840 --> 17:27.307
- WILL YOU STOP IT?

17:27.340 --> 17:28.637
- WE'RE LIKE THE INSIDERS,
BUT EVEN MORE GAY.

17:28.680 --> 17:29.829
- THE INSIDERS WERE NOT GAY.

17:29.880 --> 17:31.279
AND NEITHER ARE WE.

17:31.310 --> 17:34.768
- IDA, WE FOUND
VERONICA TOWNE'S BODY YESTERDAY.

17:34.820 --> 17:37.141
- DOES THAT UPSET YOU?

17:37.190 --> 17:39.249
- WHY WOULD IT?

17:39.290 --> 17:40.712
I WASN'T HER BIGGEST FAN.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.716
- AND WHY'S THAT?

17:42.760 --> 17:44.853
- SHE WAS A TERRIBLE WAITRESS
WHO DID WHATEVER SHE WANTED

17:44.890 --> 17:46.778
BECAUSE SHE WAS
SLEEPING WITH JORDAN.

17:46.830 --> 17:48.650
SHE DISAPPEARED ONCE
FOR SIX MONTHS

17:48.700 --> 17:50.520
AND THEN SHOWED BACK UP AND--
[snaps fingers]

17:50.570 --> 17:53.630
GOT HER JOB BACK,
JUST LIKE THAT.

17:53.670 --> 17:55.763
- YOU AND I TALKED
BACK WHEN VERONICA DISAPPEARED.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.609
YOU SAID THAT
SHE SEEMED UPSET.

17:57.640 --> 17:58.607
- YES.

17:58.640 --> 18:00.699
SHE WAS CRYING HYSTERICALLY

18:00.740 --> 18:02.799
AND SAYING OVER AND OVER,

18:02.840 --> 18:05.149
"I WILL NOT DO THIS ALONE."

18:05.180 --> 18:06.841
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

18:06.880 --> 18:08.643
- DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS MAN?

18:08.680 --> 18:10.784
HIS NAME IS LOU GAMBLE, HE USED
TO WORK SECURITY BACK THEN.

18:10.820 --> 18:13.584
- ALL THE SECURITY GUYS
STAYED IN THE PARKING LOT.

18:13.620 --> 18:14.450
I NEVER MET ANY OF THEM.

18:14.490 --> 18:16.811
- SECURITY GUYS?
LIKE, PLURAL?

18:16.860 --> 18:18.680
WHAT, WAS THIS PLACE
JAMMIN' BACK IN THE DAY?

18:18.730 --> 18:19.856
- HARDLY.

18:19.890 --> 18:22.427
I DON'T THINK THIS CROWD,
OR ANYTHING FOR THAT MATTER,

18:22.460 --> 18:23.722
HAS CHANGED SINCE THE '505.

18:25.530 --> 18:26.565
- THAT'S INTERESTING.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.136
WOULD YOU MIND IF WE
TOOK A PEEK IN YOUR KITCHEN?

18:28.170 --> 18:29.637
- SURE.

18:29.670 --> 18:32.138
BUT IT HASN'T BEEN OPERATIONAL
SINCE ELLIS SOLD THE PLACE.

18:32.170 --> 18:33.330
- YOU MEAN JORDAN.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.632
- JORDAN WAS JUST
THE FRONT MAN.

18:35.680 --> 18:38.478
HIS FATHER NEVER LET HIM
HAVE OWNERSHIP OF ANYTHING.

18:38.510 --> 18:40.216
- HMM.

18:40.250 --> 18:42.309
'SCUSE US.

18:45.650 --> 18:47.686
- DUDE, WHY WOULD
ELLIS BEAUMONT

18:47.720 --> 18:49.381
BE INTERESTED
IN A DIVE LIKE THIS?

18:49.420 --> 18:50.887
AND WHAT WOULD HE POSSIBLY
NEED SECURITY FOR?

18:50.930 --> 18:52.921
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I'M NOT MAD AT IDA.

18:52.960 --> 18:55.292
SOMETHIN' ABOUT OLDER WOMEN
IN INAPPROPRIATE OUTFITS

18:55.330 --> 18:56.297
KEEPIN' IT NICE AND TIGHT.

18:56.330 --> 18:57.695
- GUS, SHE'S OLD ENOUGH TO BE

18:57.730 --> 18:59.823
YOUR MOTHER'S YOUNGER,
SEXIER...SOMETHING. I GET IT.

18:59.870 --> 19:02.532
- SEE?

19:02.570 --> 19:04.435
- THAT'S WEIRD.
THERE'S NO OVEN IN HERE.

19:04.470 --> 19:06.461
JUST A BUNCH OF BURNERS.

19:09.780 --> 19:13.614
AND SODIUM BICARBONATE.
- BAKIN' SODA?

19:13.650 --> 19:14.719
- BACON SODA?
- YEAH.

19:14.750 --> 19:15.819
THAT'S A GENIUS IDEA, GUS,

19:15.850 --> 19:16.839
BUT I'M NOT SURE
THE WORLD IS READY

19:16.880 --> 19:18.279
FOR A PORK-FLAVORED BEVERAGE.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.356
- I DISAGREE,
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID.

19:20.390 --> 19:21.379
BAKING SODA.

19:21.420 --> 19:22.887
BAKING.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.923
THAT'S WHAT
SODIUM BICARBONATE IS.

19:27.830 --> 19:31.766
- WHAT THE HELL
WERE THEY MAKING HERE?

19:31.800 --> 19:33.233
- CRACK?

19:33.270 --> 19:34.532
- LOOK, THE BEAUMONTS
OWNED THE PLACE

19:34.570 --> 19:35.798
AT THE EXACT TIME

19:35.840 --> 19:37.307
THAT THE DRUG WAS RUNNING
RAMPANT EVERWVHERE.

19:37.340 --> 19:38.500
- I THINK HIS SENSE
IS RIGHT.

19:38.540 --> 19:39.666
THERE WAS ENOUGH
STUFF IN THE KITCHEN

19:39.710 --> 19:41.234
TO MIX THE DRUG
ON A BIG SCALE.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.339
- ELLIS BEAUMONT
WAS PUSHING DRUGS?

19:43.380 --> 19:44.699
- WELL, HE DEFINITELY
WASN'T MAKING HIS MONEY

19:44.750 --> 19:45.705
FROM COOKING FOOD.

19:45.750 --> 19:46.705
- YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

19:46.750 --> 19:47.739
- HOW DID THE DEPARTMENT
NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS?

19:47.780 --> 19:51.682
- 'CAUSE HE HAD PROTECTION
FROM ONE OF OUR OWN.

19:51.720 --> 19:52.914
MY EX-PARTNER, LOU GAMBLE.

19:52.950 --> 19:55.259
- WELL, THIS GETS
BETTER AND BETTER.

19:55.290 --> 19:57.758
LASSITER,
LET'S TRACK DOWN JORDAN ASAP.

19:57.790 --> 19:59.621
- TRACK HIM DOWN,
ISN'T HE HERE?

19:59.660 --> 20:01.753
- HIS LAWYER ARRANGED
HIS RELEASE A HALF-HOUR AGO.

20:01.800 --> 20:02.789
WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH
TO HOLD HIM.

20:02.830 --> 20:03.797
- I'LL BRING HIM BACK IN.

20:03.830 --> 20:04.967
DEAD OR ALIVE.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.763
- ALIVE.
- FINE.

20:06.800 --> 20:09.439
DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT CONSCIOUS.

20:09.470 --> 20:11.461
[phone vibrates]

20:14.510 --> 20:16.876
- HELLO?
- HOW'S YOUR DAY, SHAWN?

20:16.910 --> 20:17.672
- I'M SORRY, WHAT WAS THAT?

20:17.710 --> 20:19.871
- STAY AWAY
FROM THE TOWNE CASE.

20:19.910 --> 20:20.945
THAT'S A WARNING.

20:20.980 --> 20:22.914
- WHO IS THIS?
IS THIS JORDAN?

20:22.950 --> 20:24.941
[phone vibrates]

20:27.490 --> 20:29.310
- HELLO?
- HEY, IT'S THE WOODMASTER.

20:29.360 --> 20:31.453
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT
TO GET DOWN HERE.

20:31.490 --> 20:35.620
SO I'VE BEEN DOING
SOME MORE WORK ON VERONICA HERE,

20:35.660 --> 20:37.969
AND TWO
INTERESTING THINGS CAME UP.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.369
ONE: I BELIEVE SHE
WENT TO VIRGINIA TECH.

20:42.400 --> 20:43.628
NOTICE THE "V.T."
ON HER NECKLACE.

20:43.670 --> 20:44.864
- WHICH STANDS
FOR "VERONICA TOWNE."

20:44.910 --> 20:46.798
- SCRATCH THAT.

20:46.840 --> 20:49.638
SECOND THING,
THIS IS THE BOMBSHELL:

20:49.680 --> 20:52.899
SHE HAD RECENTLY GIVEN BIRTH.

20:52.950 --> 20:53.917
- ARE YOU SURE?

20:53.950 --> 20:55.941
100%. THE LAB CONFIRMED IT.

20:57.320 --> 20:59.743
- SHE DISAPPEARED ONCE
FOR SIX MONTHS

20:59.790 --> 21:01.815
AND THEN SHOWED BACK UP
AND GOT HER JOB BACK,

21:01.860 --> 21:02.986
JUST LIKE THAT.

21:03.020 --> 21:04.885
- WELL...

21:04.930 --> 21:07.490
THE PLOT, UNLIKE YOUR HAIR,

21:07.530 --> 21:10.397
CONTINUES TO THICKEN.

21:10.430 --> 21:11.897
HERE'S WHAT I THINK,

21:11.930 --> 21:13.329
I THINK JORDAN
KNOCKED UP VERONICA,

21:13.370 --> 21:14.962
SENT HER OFF
TO HAVE THE KID IN SECRET.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.833
SHE CAME BACK TO THE BLUE DERBY,
FLIPS OUT WHEN SHE REALIZES

21:17.870 --> 21:19.462
JORDAN HAS NO INTEREST
IN BEING A FATHER.

21:19.510 --> 21:23.446
- SHE WAS CRYING HYSTERICALLY
AND SAYING, OVER AND OVER,

21:23.480 --> 21:25.038
"I WILL NOT DO THIS ALONE."

21:25.080 --> 21:26.672
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

21:26.710 --> 21:29.679
- SO SHE APPROACHES HIM,
SHE DEMANDS THAT HE GIVE MORE,

21:29.720 --> 21:31.688
WHETHER THAT MEANS
TIME OR MONEY, OR BOTH.

21:31.720 --> 21:33.859
HE FREAKS OUT.
HE CHOKES HER.

21:33.890 --> 21:35.881
AND I IMAGINE HE HAD LOU
DISPOSE OF THE BODY.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.785
- THAT IS ONE
HEARTLESS-ASS DUDE.

21:37.830 --> 21:39.024
WE NEED TO TELL
YOUR DAD ABOUT THIS.

21:39.060 --> 21:40.027
- LET'S NOT AND SAY WE DID.

21:40.060 --> 21:42.426
- COME ON, SHAWN.
HE CAN'T BE THAT ANNOYING.

21:42.460 --> 21:43.666
- LOOK, MAN, THE ONE THING
THAT I HAVE NEVER DOUBTED

21:43.700 --> 21:46.692
ABOUT MY FATHER IS THAT
HE WAS A GREAT COP.

21:48.470 --> 21:50.700
IT JUST BUMS ME OUT THAT NOW
I HAVE TO QUESTION THAT TOO.

21:50.740 --> 21:52.537
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- WHAT DO I MEAN?

21:52.570 --> 21:54.504
LET'S SEE.
HE WAS LEAD ON THE CASE.

21:54.540 --> 21:56.098
HE DIDN'T KNOW
THAT VERONICA WAS PREGNANT.

21:56.140 --> 21:58.040
HE DIDN'T KNOW
THE BLUE DERBY WAS A CRACK DEN.

21:58.080 --> 21:59.843
AND HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
HIS OWN PARTNER WAS ON THE TAKE.

21:59.880 --> 22:01.472
- CUT THE MAN
SOME SLACK, SHAWN.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.044
SANTA BARBARA
HAS CHANGED A LOT SINCE THEN.

22:03.080 --> 22:04.980
THERE WAS A LOT OF UNDERHANDED,
SHADY STUFF GOING ON.

22:05.020 --> 22:07.818
- PLACES DON'T CHANGE, GUS.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.418
STOP MAKIN' EXCUSES FOR HIM.

22:09.460 --> 22:10.529
- WHAT?

22:11.990 --> 22:17.394
*

22:19.400 --> 22:21.391
- JULES?

22:22.970 --> 22:24.835
OH, GOD.

22:35.150 --> 22:36.947
[objects clattering]

22:36.980 --> 22:38.948
- HELLO?

22:38.990 --> 22:41.982
[suspenseful music]

22:43.430 --> 22:44.385
- MMM'
- GUS!-

22:44.430 --> 22:45.886
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

22:45.930 --> 22:46.885
- [talking with mouth full]

22:46.930 --> 22:48.557
- WHAT?

22:48.600 --> 22:50.158
- SORRY.
I HAD A MOUTH FULL OF M&Ms.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.963
SHAWN GAVE ME HIS KEY AND SAID
TO WAIT TILL YOU GOT BACK.

22:52.000 --> 22:52.967
HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

22:53.000 --> 22:53.967
- WORRIED? WHY?

22:54.000 --> 22:56.093
AND I WAS SAVING
THOSE M&Ms TO MAKE BROWNIES.

22:56.140 --> 22:57.960
- JULES!

22:58.010 --> 23:00.001
OH, THANK GOD.

23:00.040 --> 23:01.075
WHY AREN'T YOU
ANSWERING YOUR PHONE?

23:01.110 --> 23:02.907
- I WAS ON A RUN ON MY BREAK.

23:02.940 --> 23:04.908
WHAT IS GOING ON?
- OKAY, FIRST THINGS FIRST.

23:04.950 --> 23:06.702
WHEN WERE YOU THINKING ABOUT
PUTTING ON THOSE BROWNIES?

23:06.750 --> 23:09.116
- SOMEONE CLEARLY
TRYING TO INTIMIDATE ME

23:09.150 --> 23:10.139
INTO DROPPING THIS CASE.

23:10.180 --> 23:13.183
WE FOUND THESE ON GUS'S CAR.

23:13.220 --> 23:15.154
- SOMEONE'S FOLLOWING ME?

23:15.190 --> 23:16.589
- YES.

23:16.620 --> 23:17.985
PRETTY SURE IT'S JORDAN.

23:18.030 --> 23:20.794
HE'S BEEN COMPLETELY OFF THE MAP
SINCE HE WAS RELEASED.

23:20.830 --> 23:23.025
LISTEN, YOU CAN'T JUST
DROP OUT OF CONTACT LIKE THAT.

23:23.060 --> 23:24.960
- SHAWN, RELAX. I'M OKAY.
[phone ringing]

23:26.770 --> 23:28.135
- LOOK, I THINK I'M GONNA
STICK AROUND HERE FOR A WHILE.

23:28.170 --> 23:29.535
AT LEAST TILL
WE SOLVE THIS THING.

23:29.570 --> 23:31.629
- THANK YOU,
BUT I AM PERFECT LY CAPABLE

23:31.670 --> 23:32.637
OF TAKING CARE OF MYSELF.

23:32.670 --> 23:34.206
- JUST LET ME.

23:34.240 --> 23:36.504
PLEASE?

23:36.540 --> 23:38.076
- OKAY.

23:38.110 --> 23:40.101
- HELLO?
- GUS, IS JULIET OKAY?

23:40.150 --> 23:41.572
- YEAH, SHE'S FINE.

23:41.620 --> 23:43.542
AREN'T YOU CURIOUS HOW I AM?
- NOT REALLY.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.979
NOW, LISTEN, TELL SHAWN
THAT LASSITER HAS SET UP A TRACE

23:46.020 --> 23:47.885
ON HIS CELL PHONE
SO WE CAN NAIL DOWN THE LOCATION

23:47.920 --> 23:48.887
OF THIS CALLER.

23:48.920 --> 23:50.217
- OKAY.
- WAIT. ONE MORE THING.

23:50.260 --> 23:52.080
I'VE BEEN DOING
A LITTLE DIGGING ON JORDAN.

23:52.130 --> 23:56.021
GET THIS. TURNS OUT HE WAS
MARRIED FOR A YEAR BACK IN '97.

23:56.060 --> 23:57.049
- [mouth full]
TO WHO?

23:59.100 --> 24:00.465
- SO WHERE'S YOUR FATHER?

24:00.500 --> 24:03.060
- DON'T WORRY, IDA,
HE'S ON HIS WAY.

24:03.100 --> 24:05.068
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US
YOU WERE MARRIED TO JORDAN?

24:05.110 --> 24:06.668
- NEVER CAME UP.

24:06.710 --> 24:08.905
BESIDES, IT'S NOT SOMETHING
I LIKE TO TALK ABOUT.

24:08.940 --> 24:11.602
IT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST
DEPRESSING TIME IN MY LIFE.

24:11.650 --> 24:13.106
- THAT SAYS A LOT.

24:13.150 --> 24:14.674
- WHY DID IT END, EXACTLY?

24:14.720 --> 24:16.642
- I WANTED CHILDREN.

24:16.680 --> 24:18.113
- AND HE DIDN'T?

24:18.150 --> 24:21.017
- LET'S JUST SAY THEY
WEREN'T IN THE CARDS FOR HIM.

24:21.060 --> 24:22.015
- MEANING WHAT?

24:22.060 --> 24:23.982
- HIS JUICE HAD NO PULP.

24:24.030 --> 24:25.759
- HMM?

24:25.790 --> 24:27.621
- HIS SEED WASN'T FRUITFUL.

24:27.660 --> 24:29.992
- MAN WAS A FARMER?
HE WASN'T--

24:30.030 --> 24:31.861
- HE WAS POURING DECAF.
- [whispers] COFFEE?

24:31.900 --> 24:32.992
- PUMPING UNLEADED?

24:33.030 --> 24:34.190
- GAS? I DON'T--

24:34.240 --> 24:36.196
- HIS HALL HAD NO OATES?

24:36.240 --> 24:37.559
HE WAS STERILE!

24:37.610 --> 24:39.601
- OHH.
- OH, SURE.

24:39.640 --> 24:40.777
- HALL. OATES.

24:40.810 --> 24:43.108
- THAT MAKES TOTAL SENSE.

24:43.140 --> 24:44.903
[speaking Spanish]

24:44.950 --> 24:47.043
- [scoffs] EXACTLY.
- WHATEVER.

24:47.080 --> 24:48.741
- [scoffs] SHE DOESN'T
SPEAK SPANISH, SHAWN.

24:48.780 --> 24:50.748
- WILL YOU EXCUSE US
FOR JUST ONE MOMENT?

24:50.790 --> 24:52.781
- PLEASE.
- GLADLY.

24:54.960 --> 24:55.915
- HOLY CRAP, GUS.

24:55.960 --> 24:57.154
THAT MEANS JORDAN
COULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE ONE

24:57.190 --> 24:58.020
THAT KNOCKED UP VERONICA.

24:58.060 --> 24:59.925
- DOES THAT MEAN
HE DIDN'T KILL HER?

24:59.960 --> 25:01.621
- NOT NECESSARILY.

25:01.660 --> 25:03.127
WE GOTTA FIGURE OUT
WHO THE REAL FATHER WAS.

25:03.160 --> 25:05.128
- AND HOW DO WE DO THAT?

25:05.170 --> 25:07.092
- [sighs]

25:10.240 --> 25:11.969
I'VE GOT SOMETHING.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.705
THANK YOU
FOR MEETING WITH US, DOCTOR.

25:13.740 --> 25:14.968
- OH, OF COURSE.

25:15.010 --> 25:16.898
ONE OF MY TRUE PLEASURES IN LIFE
IS GETTING TO MEET THE PEOPLE

25:16.940 --> 25:19.147
I HELP BRING INTO THIS WORLD.

25:19.180 --> 25:21.239
PLUS, UH, STEVIE HERE
MADE ENOUGH FISH TO FEED

25:21.280 --> 25:23.168
THE ENTIRE
CAMBODIAN AIR FORCE.

25:23.220 --> 25:24.016
OH, DON'T WORRY.

25:24.050 --> 25:25.984
HE DOESN'T SPEAK
A LICK OF ENGLISH.

25:26.020 --> 25:27.578
- ACTUALLY, I DO.

25:27.620 --> 25:28.757
- HUH. LOOK AT THAT.

25:28.790 --> 25:29.984
17 YEARS.

25:30.020 --> 25:32.284
YOU ARE
FULL OF SURPRISES, STEVIE.

25:32.330 --> 25:36.198
[both laugh]

25:36.230 --> 25:37.299
- OH.

25:37.330 --> 25:41.061
HOW 'BOUT THAT.

25:41.100 --> 25:42.192
UH, CON FESSION.

25:42.240 --> 25:45.129
YOU DID NOT DELIVER ME
AS A BABY, DOCTOR.

25:45.170 --> 25:46.706
- OH.
- NO, SIR.

25:46.740 --> 25:49.208
THAT HONOR WENT
TO A CABBIE NAMED JUGDISH.

25:49.240 --> 25:50.639
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING,

25:50.680 --> 25:51.977
BUT IT WASN'T EVEN
AN EMERGENCY LABOR.

25:52.010 --> 25:53.568
- HMM.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.315
- JUGDISH JUST BROUGHT
MY MOTHER GREAT COMFORT.

25:55.350 --> 25:57.238
BACK IN INDIA,
HE WAS A DOCTOR.

25:57.280 --> 25:58.918
OF MUSICOLOGY.

25:58.950 --> 26:01.180
- BUT YOU DID DELIVER THE CHILD
OF A WOMAN WE ONCE KNEW.

26:01.220 --> 26:03.051
- OH, REALLY?
WHO WAS THAT?

26:03.090 --> 26:04.921
- VERONICA TOWNE.

26:09.300 --> 26:10.995
- WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU BOYS AFTER?

26:11.030 --> 26:12.361
- THE TRUTH WOULD BE NICE.

26:12.400 --> 26:13.697
OR SOME MALLOMARS.

26:13.740 --> 26:14.798
- WE'RE NOT SETTLING
FOR MALLOMARS.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.193
- I DIDN'T SAY
WE WERE SETTLING.

26:16.240 --> 26:19.209
- I SEE.

26:19.240 --> 26:23.802
"THE TRUTH IS HEAW, THEREFORE,
FEW CARE TO CARRY IT."

26:23.850 --> 26:25.169
WINSTON CHURCHILL SAID THAT.

26:25.210 --> 26:27.371
- [laughs]
LOOK, DOCTOR.

26:27.410 --> 26:30.174
I DON'T CARE IF THE FORMER PRIME
MINISTER OF ENGLAND SAID IT.

26:30.220 --> 26:32.609
WHAT I KNOW IS THAT
VERONICA TOWNE'S BODY

26:32.650 --> 26:34.254
WAS RECENTLY DISCOVERED

26:34.290 --> 26:36.155
WITH YOUR BUSINESS CARD ON IT.

26:36.190 --> 26:38.181
[slurps loudly]

26:40.060 --> 26:41.891
- 20 YEARS AGO,

26:41.930 --> 26:44.763
SHE ARRIVED AT A CLINIC
I HAD ON THE OUTSIDE OF TOWN.

26:44.800 --> 26:46.791
THE ENTIRE DELIVERY
RAN THREE HOURS.

26:46.830 --> 26:48.388
SHE HAD A GIRL.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.261
- WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
WHO THE FATHER WAS.

26:51.310 --> 26:53.301
[slurps loudly]

26:53.340 --> 26:55.274
- THAT I CANNOT TELL YOU.

26:55.310 --> 26:58.802
SHE DIDN'T TELL ME,
NOR DID I CARE.

26:58.850 --> 27:00.408
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

27:00.450 --> 27:02.645
I THINK I'LL FINISH THIS
INSIDE.

27:05.050 --> 27:09.214
BUT I'LL ADVISE YOU BOYS
TO WATCH YOUR STEP.

27:09.260 --> 27:12.286
THE PAST CAN BE TREACHEROUS.

27:12.330 --> 27:15.151
- CAN YOU AT LEAST
TELL US THE GIRL'S NAME?

27:15.200 --> 27:17.225
- YES.

27:17.260 --> 27:18.966
DAH LIA.
DAH LIA TOWN E.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.384
- DUDE, THERE ARE NO LISTINGS
FOR A DAHLIA TOWNE ANYWHERE.

27:45.430 --> 27:47.125
WE NEED TO CHECK
THE BIRTH RECORDS

27:47.160 --> 27:48.195
AND THE ADOPTION RECORDS.

27:48.230 --> 27:49.925
- DUDE, I AM TIRED.

27:49.960 --> 27:52.269
NOW, GET YOUR STUFF
AND GO BE WITH JULIET.

27:52.300 --> 27:53.119
WE'LL DO IT IN THE MORNING.

27:53.170 --> 27:54.933
- THE MORNING
MAY BE TOO LATE, GUS.

27:54.970 --> 27:56.892
I'M NOT GONNA MESS UP THIS
INVESTIGATION LIKE MY DAD DID.

27:56.940 --> 28:00.159
- MAN, YOU NEED TO WORK OUT YOUR
DADDY ISSUES ON YOUR OWN TIME.

28:00.210 --> 28:02.030
NOW, I'M 'BOUT TO GO HOME
AND HAVE A THREESOME

28:02.080 --> 28:05.208
WITH TWO TOBLERONES,
AND THEN HIT THE SACK.

28:05.250 --> 28:06.444
- SUCK IT.
- YOU SUCK IT.

28:06.480 --> 28:08.948
both:
* SUCK IT

28:08.980 --> 28:09.947
- I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

28:09.980 --> 28:11.982
- ALL RIGHT, MAN.

28:22.460 --> 28:24.462
[footsteps]

28:30.770 --> 28:32.829
[footsteps]

28:42.820 --> 28:44.287
[footsteps]

28:44.320 --> 28:46.880
- ALL RIGHT, WHO'S THERE?

28:46.920 --> 28:48.911
JORDAN?

28:55.430 --> 28:57.091
[grunts]

28:57.130 --> 28:58.358
- NICE NIGHT FOR A WALK.

28:58.400 --> 28:59.526
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN.

28:59.570 --> 29:01.333
I'VE GOT SIX BUCKS AND A
PICTURE OF MARY STUART MASTERSON

29:01.370 --> 29:02.496
IN MY WALLET--
IT'S ALL YOURS.

29:02.540 --> 29:04.030
- FIND ANOTHER CASE.

29:04.070 --> 29:06.209
THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING.

29:06.240 --> 29:07.878
- [shouts]

29:15.320 --> 29:18.312
[rhythmic knocking at door]

29:26.160 --> 29:28.128
HELLO, THEA.
- GOIN' SOMEWHERE?

29:28.160 --> 29:29.320
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR EYE?

29:29.360 --> 29:31.362
- WHEN I DON'T SLEEP, I GET
A DARK CIRCLE UNDER ONE EYE.

29:31.400 --> 29:32.867
WHERE'S JORDAN?

29:32.900 --> 29:33.889
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

29:33.940 --> 29:35.464
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
DO US A FAVOR AND CUT THE CRAP.

29:35.500 --> 29:38.503
HIS CAR IS PARKED OUT BACK.

29:40.270 --> 29:42.272
REALLY?

29:43.610 --> 29:46.579
HELLO, KITTY CAT.

29:46.610 --> 29:49.374
- [shouts]
OW! WHAT THE HELL?

29:49.420 --> 29:50.375
- NOW WE'RE EVEN.

29:50.420 --> 29:52.012
- FOR WHAT?
- FOR THIS.

29:52.050 --> 29:53.449
AND FOR THREATENING
MY GIRLFRIEND.

29:53.490 --> 29:55.117
- WHAT? NO! OH, MY G--

29:55.160 --> 29:57.287
I NEVER DID
ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

29:57.320 --> 29:58.287
LOOK, I AM INNOCENT.

29:58.330 --> 29:59.957
- THEN WHY WERE YOU HIDING?

29:59.990 --> 30:02.493
- BECAUSE MY LAWYER TOLD ME
TO STAY OUT OF SIGHT.

30:02.530 --> 30:04.395
HE WAS WORRIED THERE'S
GONNA BE A MEDIA CIRCUS.

30:04.430 --> 30:07.160
- OH, PLEASE. YOU MUST THINK
WE'RE COMPLETE IDIOTS.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.394
I KNOW IT'S YOU
WHO'S BEEN CALLIN' ME.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.431
[phone rings]

30:16.540 --> 30:17.438
HELLO?

30:17.480 --> 30:21.314
- YOU SHOULD HAVE
TAKEN MY ADVICE, SHAWN.

30:21.350 --> 30:22.339
[caller hangs up]

30:23.380 --> 30:25.519
- HEY, LOOK MAN,
I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR EYE, OKAY?

30:25.550 --> 30:27.438
[phone rings]

30:27.490 --> 30:28.457
HELLO?

30:28.490 --> 30:30.048
- SPENCER, LISTEN.
WE TRACED THAT PHONE CALL.

30:30.090 --> 30:32.251
IT CAME FROM THE CORNER
OF 26TH AND HOLLAND.

30:32.290 --> 30:33.257
THAT'S TWO BLOCKS FROM YOU.

30:33.290 --> 30:34.496
- 26TH AND HOLLAND.
GOT IT.

30:34.530 --> 30:36.521
PUT SOME ICE ON THAT.

30:38.630 --> 30:39.824
- AHH.

30:59.620 --> 31:03.408
- WORST BOY BAND EVER.

31:08.300 --> 31:10.291
- JACK!

31:13.600 --> 31:16.296
_ JA--

31:16.340 --> 31:18.035
- WHO'RE WE CHASING?
- JACK ATWATER, A DETECTIVE.

31:18.070 --> 31:19.059
HE USED TO WORK WITH MY DAD.

31:19.110 --> 31:21.203
- HOW OLD IS HE?
- AT LEAST 70.

31:21.240 --> 31:23.606
- THEN WHY CAN'T WE CATCH HIM?

31:23.640 --> 31:24.948
WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?

31:24.980 --> 31:26.106
- I DON'T DO WELL
AT HIGH ALTITUDES.

31:26.150 --> 31:27.572
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- YOU KNOW, LIKE DENVER.

31:27.610 --> 31:28.918
- WE'RE NOT IN DENVER!

31:28.950 --> 31:31.009
- JUST RUN, SHAWN!

31:37.420 --> 31:39.422
- IT'S OVER, JACK.

31:39.460 --> 31:41.451
[both gasping and panting]

31:50.700 --> 31:52.930
- BACK IN '91, I WAS
APPROACHED BY ELLIS BEAUMONT.

31:52.970 --> 31:56.269
HE OFFERED ME 50 GRAND TO PLAY
LOOKOUT FOR THE DRUG BUSINESS

31:56.310 --> 31:59.108
HE WAS RUNNING
OUT OF THE BLUE DERBY.

31:59.150 --> 32:02.313
I HAD TWO KIDS
IN SCHOOL, SO I BIT.

32:02.350 --> 32:05.410
THEN, HE SAID HE NEEDED
ONE MORE, SO I BROUGHT IN LOU,

32:05.450 --> 32:08.157
WHO WAS HESITANT AT FIRST BUT,
YOU KNOW, BEA HAD BEEN SICK.

32:08.190 --> 32:10.181
- YOU TOOK AN OATH, JACK.

32:10.220 --> 32:12.120
- OH, PLEASE. SPARE ME
THAT BOY SCOUT CRAP, HENRY.

32:12.160 --> 32:14.253
NOT ALL OF US COULD BE
MODEL COPS LIKE YOU.

32:14.300 --> 32:18.691
- NO WONDER I COULD NEVER GET
A LEG UP ON THE INVESTIGATION.

32:18.730 --> 32:20.061
- I'LL GIVE YOU THIS--

32:20.100 --> 32:23.069
YOU WEREN'T
AN EASY GUY TO THROW OFF.

32:23.100 --> 32:25.068
- WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?
- THINGS WERE FINE.

32:25.110 --> 32:28.238
TILL ONE DAY, ELLIS CALLED AND
SAID THERE'D BEEN AN "ACCIDENT"

32:28.280 --> 32:29.406
WITH ONE OF THE WAITRESSES.

32:29.440 --> 32:30.600
- VERONICA TOWNE.
- YEAH.

32:30.640 --> 32:33.143
HE WANTED HELP COVERING IT UP.

32:33.180 --> 32:34.340
WHEN WE SAID NO,
HE THREATENED TO TIP OFF

32:34.380 --> 32:35.711
THE CHIEF
TO WHAT WE WERE DOING.

32:35.750 --> 32:37.172
- SO YOU COVERED UP A MURDER.

32:37.220 --> 32:39.108
- WE HAD NO CHOICE.
THE JOB WAS ALL WE HAD.

32:39.150 --> 32:41.618
- YOU HAD A CHOICE!

32:41.660 --> 32:43.252
- SO LOU DISPOSED
OF THE BODY,

32:43.290 --> 32:45.986
AND THEN, A FEW WEEKS LATER,
HE STARTED TO CRACK.

32:46.030 --> 32:48.351
- SO YOU THREATENED HIM AND
HIS WIFE TO MAKE HIM SHUT UP.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.594
- AND YOU PULLED
THE SAME MOVE ON MY SON

32:49.630 --> 32:51.427
AFTER YOU KILLED
ELLIS BEAUMONT.

32:51.470 --> 32:54.166
- YES, BUT I DID NOT
KILL BEAUMONT. I SWEAR.

32:54.200 --> 32:57.192
- WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MINDS
WOULD BELIEVE THAT?

33:02.280 --> 33:03.269
- ME.

33:04.250 --> 33:05.342
- LET ME GO. JORDAN.
- NO, LISTEN.

33:05.380 --> 33:07.143
YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE.

33:07.180 --> 33:09.239
- JORDAN, THINGS WILL NEVER WORK
OUT BETWEEN THE TWO OF US.

33:09.280 --> 33:10.747
BELIEVE ME.
- WHY?

33:10.780 --> 33:13.180
- BECAUSE...

33:13.220 --> 33:15.188
SHE'S YOUR SISTER.

33:15.220 --> 33:16.653
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

33:16.690 --> 33:18.487
- YOU WEREN'T THE ONLY ONE
SLEEPING WITH VERONICA TOWNE

33:18.530 --> 33:20.418
20 YEARS AGO.

33:20.460 --> 33:21.552
YOUR DAD WAS, TOO.

33:21.600 --> 33:22.658
- AND HE GOT HER PREGNANT.

33:22.700 --> 33:23.496
AND TO HIDE IT FROM YOU,

33:23.530 --> 33:25.521
HE SENT HER AWAY
TO HAVE THE CHILD.

33:25.570 --> 33:28.334
- HER NAME IS DAHLIA.

33:28.370 --> 33:32.067
- WHAT?
- HE SAID HER NAME WAS DAHLIA.

33:32.110 --> 33:34.032
- YOUR FATHER'S PLAN WAS
TO KEEP PAYING OFF VERONICA,

33:34.080 --> 33:35.138
BUT SHE WANTED MORE.

33:35.180 --> 33:37.239
- HOW DARE YOU COME
TO MY HOUSE!

33:37.280 --> 33:38.577
- YOU CANNOT JUST ABANDON ME!

33:38.610 --> 33:39.804
I WILL NOT DO THIS ALONE!

33:39.850 --> 33:40.805
- DON'T THREATEN ME!

33:40.850 --> 33:41.817
- TH REA--

33:41.850 --> 33:43.044
[gasping]

33:43.080 --> 33:46.311
- SENSING THAT HE COULD LOSE
HIS MARRIAGE, HE TOOK ACTION.

33:46.350 --> 33:48.557
HE HAD THE OFFICERS
ON HIS PAYROLL COVER IT UP,

33:48.590 --> 33:50.512
AND THEN HE ARRANGED
TO HAVE SWEET, LITTLE DAHLIA

33:50.560 --> 33:53.358
TO BE ADOPTED
BY A COUPLE IN MICHIGAN.

33:56.260 --> 33:57.488
- NO, THIS IS ALL INSANE.

33:57.530 --> 34:00.260
- NO, IT'S NOT.

34:00.300 --> 34:01.369
A YEAR AGO,
MY PARENTS TOLD ME

34:01.400 --> 34:03.766
THAT VERONICA
WAS MY REAL MOTHER.

34:03.800 --> 34:05.802
I BECAME OBSESSED
WITH THE CASE,

34:05.840 --> 34:08.104
AND I VOWED TO FIND OUT
WHO MURDERED HER.

34:08.140 --> 34:10.438
- WHO YOU ASSUMED WAS JORDAN,
BASED ON THE NEWSPAPER ACCOUNTS.

34:10.480 --> 34:13.347
BUT SOMETHING--SOMETHING
TOLD YOU IT WAS ELLIS INSTEAD.

34:13.380 --> 34:14.449
AND I'D LIKE TO TAKE A GUESS.

34:14.480 --> 34:15.742
- SURE.

34:15.780 --> 34:16.747
YOU'RE DOING WELL SO FAR.

34:16.780 --> 34:18.589
- HE WAS COLOR BLIND.

34:18.620 --> 34:19.587
JUST LIKE YOU.

34:19.620 --> 34:20.746
- NICE PLACE.

34:20.790 --> 34:22.417
- I GUESS.

34:22.460 --> 34:23.757
IF YOU LIKE GREEN.

34:23.790 --> 34:25.451
- SEE, COLOR BLINDNESS
IS A GENETIC TRAIT

34:25.490 --> 34:28.197
THAT'S ALMOST ALWAYS PASSED
FROM FATHER TO DAUGHTER.

34:28.230 --> 34:30.323
- HAVE YOU BEEN READING
MY SCIENTIFIC WEEKLY?

34:30.360 --> 34:31.622
- NO.
- MY MEN'S HEALTH QUARTERLY?

34:31.670 --> 34:32.625
- YOU THINK WE COULD
DO THIS LATER?

34:32.670 --> 34:34.638
- STOP READING MY STUFF,
SHAWN.

34:34.670 --> 34:37.230
- ARMED WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE,
YOU CONFRONTED ELLIS,

34:37.270 --> 34:39.101
AND YOU ASKED HIM
POINT-BLANK IF HE WAS THE ONE

34:39.140 --> 34:40.129
THAT KILLED VERONICA.

34:40.170 --> 34:43.298
AND I AM ASSUMING
HE CAME CLEAN.

34:43.340 --> 34:44.341
- WITH A LITTLE PERSUASION.

34:45.310 --> 34:46.140
NOW!

34:46.180 --> 34:48.319
I THEN TOLD HIM
TO TAKE ME TO THE PLACE

34:48.350 --> 34:49.374
WHERE THEY LEFT MY MOTHER.

34:50.850 --> 34:51.885
SHOW ME WHERE YOU PUT HER.

34:51.920 --> 34:53.319
- DAHLIA, COME ON.

34:53.350 --> 34:54.715
- DON'T CALL ME THAT.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.182
- THEA, YOU'RE MY DAUGHTER.

34:56.220 --> 34:57.209
[gunshot]

35:00.390 --> 35:03.359
- I'M SORRY, JORDAN.

35:04.770 --> 35:06.362
- ROUGH DAY FOR YOU, MAN.
NO WAY AROUND THAT.

35:06.400 --> 35:08.732
THE GIRL YOU'RE DATING
TURNS OUT TO BE YOUR SISTER

35:08.770 --> 35:10.294
WHO KILLED YOUR FATHER

35:10.340 --> 35:11.238
WHO KILLED YOUR MOTHER

35:11.270 --> 35:13.329
AND WAS SLEEPING
WITH YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND.

35:13.370 --> 35:18.899
- AND SHAWN PUNCHED YOU
IN THE FACE.

35:18.950 --> 35:21.214
- I'M SORRY.

35:25.720 --> 35:26.709
- HIS GIRLFRIEND.

35:26.750 --> 35:29.184
HIS SISTER.

35:29.220 --> 35:30.187
HIS GIRLFRIEND.

35:30.220 --> 35:31.187
HIS SISTER.

35:31.230 --> 35:33.380
- FORGET ABOUT IT, SHAWN.

35:33.430 --> 35:36.399
IT'S JUST SANTA BARBARA.

35:36.430 --> 35:39.422
[film noir music]

35:50.710 --> 35:52.439
- WELL, I GUESS I SHOULD
SWING BY YOUR PLACE

35:52.480 --> 35:54.345
AND PICK UP ALL MY STUFF

35:54.380 --> 35:56.211
NOW THAT YOU'RE OKAY.

35:56.250 --> 35:58.684
- SHAWN, ALL YOU BROUGHT OVER
WERE SOME CLOTHES, A TOOTHBRUSH,

35:58.720 --> 36:00.517
AND YOUR WORKOUT BRICKS.

36:00.550 --> 36:02.552
- RIGHT. ALL MY STUFF.
- OH.

36:02.590 --> 36:05.582
- I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW, THOSE
BRICKS BUILT THIS MANHOUSE.

36:07.760 --> 36:09.899
THANK YOU.
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

36:09.930 --> 36:12.319
- I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT
HOW WORRIED YOU ALWAYS ARE

36:12.370 --> 36:13.598
WHEN YOU THINK I'M IN DANGER.

36:13.630 --> 36:15.598
- OH, JULES.

36:15.640 --> 36:17.460
MY SINGLE GREATEST FEAR
USED TO BE THAT SOMETHING

36:17.500 --> 36:18.933
WOULD HAPPEN TO ME.

36:18.970 --> 36:21.837
SECOND GREATEST FEAR WAS THAT
SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN TO GUS.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.849
CLEARLY,
ALL OF THAT HAS CHANGED.

36:24.880 --> 36:26.905
SO DO ME A FAVOR

36:26.950 --> 36:30.545
AND STOP FINDING YOURSELF
IN GRAVE DANGER.

36:30.580 --> 36:32.582
- I WILL DO MY BEST.

36:35.420 --> 36:37.718
- YOU KNOW WHAT? WHY DON'T
YOU STAY AT MY PLACE TONIGHT?

36:37.760 --> 36:40.786
TAKE YOUR THINGS HOME
TOMORROW.

36:40.830 --> 36:43.390
- OKAY, THAT'S COOL.

36:43.430 --> 36:45.261
OH, WAIT.

36:45.300 --> 36:46.528
WAIT. TOMORROW'S FRIDAY.

36:46.570 --> 36:48.834
- OH, RIGHT.

36:48.870 --> 36:50.735
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
STAY THE WEEKEND.

36:50.770 --> 36:52.635
- OH-HO-HO.

36:52.670 --> 36:56.379
THAT WOULD BE
THREE CONSECUTIVE DAYS.

36:56.410 --> 36:59.800
- 72 HOURS.
THAT'S WHAT'S ON THE TABLE.

36:59.850 --> 37:00.646
- NOT EVEN A VACATION.

37:00.680 --> 37:03.843
- NOPE.
JUST YOU AND ME AT MY PLACE.

37:09.390 --> 37:12.427
- ALL RIGHT.

37:12.460 --> 37:13.484
I'M GONNA NEED A DRAWER,
THOUGH.

37:13.530 --> 37:14.895
- [laughs]

37:14.930 --> 37:17.922
WELL, THEN YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA WAN NA LEAVE.

37:32.310 --> 37:34.414
- YO, POP. WHAT'S UP?

37:34.450 --> 37:35.917
- I'M TRYING TO CONVINCE
YOUR FATHER TO STAY ON

37:35.950 --> 37:38.612
AS A DETECTIVE
JUST A LITTLE LONGER.

37:38.650 --> 37:40.743
HE HASN'T MISSED A STEP.
- HEAR, HEAR.

37:40.790 --> 37:42.815
- NO.
MY DETECTIVE DAYS ARE OVER.

37:42.860 --> 37:44.748
SO IS MY CAREER
IN POLICE WORK.

37:44.790 --> 37:45.757
- WHAT?

37:45.790 --> 37:46.950
- WAIT. YOU'RE RETIRING?

37:46.990 --> 37:48.628
- EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.

37:48.660 --> 37:50.628
MY RESIGNATION LETTER
IS ALREADY ON YOUR DESK.

37:50.660 --> 37:51.763
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

37:51.800 --> 37:53.893
IS THIS BECAUSE I YELLED
AT YOU FOR THE PANTS THING?

37:53.930 --> 37:56.728
LOOK, DAD.
IF YOU NEED TO DROP TROU...

37:56.770 --> 37:57.737
YOU CAN DROP TROU.

37:57.770 --> 37:59.408
- NO, NO, NO. IT'S JUST--

37:59.440 --> 38:00.805
MY HEART'S NOT IN IT ANYMORE.

38:00.840 --> 38:02.637
- HENRY, I THINK
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THIS.

38:02.680 --> 38:05.069
- THERE'S NO NEED TO, KAREN.

38:05.110 --> 38:07.499
IT'S TIME.

38:07.550 --> 38:09.814
- WELL.

38:09.850 --> 38:12.887
LET ME KNOW
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND.

38:12.920 --> 38:15.650
YOU'LL BE MISSED.

38:15.690 --> 38:17.681
- THANKS FOR EVERYTHING,
KAREN.

38:22.960 --> 38:24.860
- ALL RIGHT. HOW LONG HAVE
YOU BEEN THINKIN' ABOUT THIS?

38:24.900 --> 38:26.595
- OH, NOT LONG.

38:26.630 --> 38:27.961
THE ONLY REASON
I STUCK AROUND FOR SO LONG

38:28.000 --> 38:30.935
WAS BECAUSE OF THE RESPECT
I HAD FOR THE JOB.

38:30.970 --> 38:32.039
BUT NOW?

38:32.070 --> 38:33.935
NAH.

38:33.970 --> 38:36.905
- DAD,
I--I GET IT, AND I'M--

38:36.940 --> 38:37.907
I'M REALLY SORRY.

38:37.940 --> 38:38.770
BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S STILL

38:38.810 --> 38:39.902
A LOT OF DAMN GOOD COPS
ON THE FORCE.

38:39.950 --> 38:42.669
AND THEY GO OUT THERE
AND PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE

38:42.720 --> 38:45.041
EVERY DAY
FOR THE RIGHT REASONS.

38:45.090 --> 38:47.843
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

38:47.890 --> 38:49.881
IT'S JUST NOT
MY GAME ANYMORE, KID.

38:53.090 --> 38:55.695
- WHAT?

38:55.730 --> 38:56.890
YOUR OLD POLICE HAT?

38:56.930 --> 38:58.397
[laughs]

38:58.430 --> 39:00.398
YOU REMEMBERI USED
TO PUT THIS THING ON AS A KID,

39:00.430 --> 39:02.739
RUN ALL OVER THE HOUSE
BUMPIN' INTO STUFF?

39:02.770 --> 39:05.603
DREAMIN' THAT ONE DAY
I'D BE THIS AMAZING COP,

39:05.640 --> 39:08.131
JUST LIKE MY OLD MAN.

39:08.170 --> 39:11.071
- YEAH, WELL, I GUESS YOUR,
UH, PERCEPTION OF ME

39:11.110 --> 39:13.943
HAS CHANGED
A LITTLE SINCE THEN, HUH?

39:13.980 --> 39:16.972
- ACTUALLY IT'S
QUITE THE CONTRARY.

39:21.760 --> 39:23.648
- WHAT DO YOU SAY YOU AND I
GO OUT AND GRAB A BEER

39:23.690 --> 39:25.988
A LITTLE LATER?

39:26.030 --> 39:26.883
- BEER?

39:26.930 --> 39:28.158
- YEAH.

39:28.190 --> 39:29.498
- WOW. THAT'S NOT
REALLY YOUR THING, IS IT?

39:29.530 --> 39:30.497
- YEAH, I KNOW.

39:30.530 --> 39:31.565
MAYBE WE CAN CHANGE THAT,

39:31.600 --> 39:34.125
NOW THAT I HAVE
SOME TIME ON MY HANDS.

39:34.170 --> 39:35.034
- I'M NOT GONNA LIE TO YA,

39:35.070 --> 39:38.506
A COLD BEER SOUNDS
RICH AND DELICIOUS.

39:38.540 --> 39:39.507
I THINK WE SHOULD GO NOW.

39:39.540 --> 39:40.962
LET'S GET ONE NOW.

39:41.010 --> 39:44.798
- FIRST, I GOTTA BREAK SOME
BAD NEWS TO AN OLD FRIEND.

39:44.850 --> 39:46.977
- SO MUCH BIGGER THAN MINE,
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

39:47.010 --> 39:49.012
- IT'S YOURS, KID.

39:54.120 --> 39:57.453
I'M SORRY TO BE THE ONE
TO BREAK IT TO YOU, JERRY.

39:57.490 --> 39:58.821
- I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

39:58.860 --> 40:01.454
THE FOUR OF US
WERE LIKE BROTHERS.

40:01.500 --> 40:04.492
- I GUESS WE'RE THE LAST
OF THE GOOD ONES, HUH?

40:07.870 --> 40:10.862
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
RETIREMENT'S BEEN GOOD TO YA.

40:10.900 --> 40:13.505
- OH, YEAH. THANKS.

40:13.540 --> 40:15.508
I TOLD YA TO LET ME
DO YOUR INVESTING FOR YA.

40:15.540 --> 40:17.531
- [laughing]
I KNOW, I KNOW.

40:20.180 --> 40:23.115
I STILL CAN'T UNDERSTAND
HOW THEY WOULD DO ALL OF THAT

40:23.150 --> 40:24.583
JUST FOR MONEY.

40:24.620 --> 40:27.612
- WELL, 50 GRAND

- 50 GRAND.
I-I-IT WAS A LOT OF CASH.

- YEAH, IT IS.

40:47.770 --> 40:48.976

SOMEONE SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME.

I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH THESE
OLD RECORDS FOR EIGHT HOURS.

40:51.010 --> 40:51.977

OF EVERYONE WHO FILED TO WORK

TO MAKE SURE IT WASN'T FOUND.
