You reckon?

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000

- Hi.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.950
We're getting married tomorrow!

02:27.000 --> 02:28.950
- Mm-mm. No. Day after tomorrow.
- Are you sure?

- Mm-hm.
- Are you sure?

02:31.000 --> 02:33.540
Oh, no, shit. No, it is tomorrow.

When you're done here? You cheeky bastard.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.950
Do you think when they're
married, he'll still be sneaking in

03:45.000 --> 03:46.950
her bedroom window?

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
They'll be in married
quarters so he won't need to.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.950

03:53.000 --> 03:54.950
No. Just go to sleep.

It's bloody good, though,
isn't it? Moving and hilarious.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.470
Yes, love.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.470
Oh, gross!

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
I'd rather listen to your speech
than them bonking next door.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.950
Hiya. What've you been up to,
you dirty, horrible degenerate?

04:21.000 --> 04:23.950
Nothing, just been, erm, practising
my wedding dance with your sister.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.950
Oh, yeah, bet you have(!)

04:26.000 --> 04:27.950
- Oi! Tarring me with your
brush, again. - Morning.

04:28.000 --> 04:28.950
What's going on?

04:29.000 --> 04:31.950
Erm, I am just about to head back
to London, to try my glad rags on.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.950
Not getting married in
your birthday suit, then?

04:34.000 --> 04:35.950
No, can't afford the bridesmaids
fainting at the altar, can we?

wedding dance apparently.

wedding dance then, Elvis?

04:41.000 --> 04:43.950
You going to be shaking your funky
stuff on the dance floor, Elvis?

04:44.000 --> 04:45.950
- Can't tell you.
- Hey, are you going to serenade us?

04:46.000 --> 04:48.950
I mean, your mum must have
called you Elvis for a reason.

04:49.000 --> 04:49.950
I can't tell you, it's classified!

04:50.000 --> 04:51.950
I can hold a tune, me.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.950

Georgie, where is he? He
is still coming, in't he?

He should be waiting for
you, not you waiting for him!

07:45.000 --> 07:46.950
Oh, he's always late on parade, it's fine.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.950
The groom should be here before the
bride, you know that, don't you?

07:50.000 --> 07:52.540
Oh, I know. I know what he's like.

07:59.950 --> 08:00.950
It's fine.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.950

08:04.000 --> 08:06.950
It's only five past, we've got the
place till half past, don't worry!

08:07.000 --> 08:08.950
Have you spoken to him this morning?

08:09.000 --> 08:10.200
(No.)

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
What's going on?

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Er... can we go somewhere private?

08:34.000 --> 08:35.200
Yeah.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
- Is everything all right?
- Who's that?

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
I'm so sorry, Georgie.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
He said...

08:53.000 --> 08:54.670
Tell me again.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.870
He said that he can't go through with it.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
And that's it?

09:12.000 --> 09:14.140
Why's he done this to me?

09:19.000 --> 09:20.200
Dad!

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
It's all right. Let it out. Let it out.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.950
So, on the cry of "man down", you
get to the body as soon as you can,

09:52.000 --> 09:54.950
making sure of your own personal safety.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.950
Why, Jenkinson?

09:57.000 --> 10:00.950
Erm, so... Sorry, I'm not sure, Staff.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.950
Because a dead medic is
no use to their platoon.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.950
So once it is safe, and
you've done your 5s, your 20s,

10:08.000 --> 10:09.950
proceed to the casualty.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.950
Carry out your primary
survey -- C, A, B, C.

10:13.000 --> 10:20.000
Yeah? Catastrophic bleed,
airway, breathing, circulation.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.950
So what do we do, Cox?

10:25.000 --> 10:27.950
Yeah, erm, check the airwaves
and then make sure...

10:28.000 --> 10:29.950
Airway, Cox. Airway.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.950
Erm... Erm...

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
Catastrophic bleed, airway,
breathing, circulation...

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
.. deformities, environment exposure.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Cox, airway. Now.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.950
You're all right, relax.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
- Sir.
- Relax.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.950
All right, Georgie, how have you been?

11:20.000 --> 11:21.950
Yeah, good, thanks, sir.
How's things with you?

11:22.000 --> 11:24.950
Yeah, very well, thank you.
Molly's back in Afghan.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
Yeah, I heard. Facebook.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.950
She's working with the
training and advisory team.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.400
You probably know that already.

11:36.950 --> 11:37.950
So what you doing here?

11:38.000 --> 11:40.950
Final mission-specific training
on the moors before Kenya.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.950
You going Kenya?

11:43.000 --> 11:44.950
Humanitarian mission.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.650
Outreach project in the refugee
camps on the Somali border.

11:48.700 --> 11:51.700
Well, some of us have
to work for a living.

11:52.950 --> 11:53.950
I've just had a word with your CO

11:54.000 --> 11:56.470
and he thinks it's a sound idea.

11:56.950 --> 11:57.950
What?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.950
Need a medic.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.950
Experienced. Top of the
range, fully loaded,

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
and you fit the bill.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
What do you think?

12:10.000 --> 12:12.950
Actually, don't answer that now,
you can chat it through with your

12:13.000 --> 12:14.950
loved ones and tell me in the morning.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.950
And you can say to your new
chap that it's only six weeks

12:17.000 --> 12:18.950
and you'll be back by Christmas.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.950
Isn't that what they said when they
headed out to the First World War?

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
I wouldn't know, Georgie.
I'm not as old as I look.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.950
How do you know that I've got a new chap?

12:29.000 --> 12:30.950
Ah. Molly.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.950
No secret is safe with social media.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.950
No.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.950
He's a doctor, I believe.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.540
Mm-hm, a notch up from a squaddie.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
Well, why don't you think that over?

12:50.000 --> 12:52.740
You won't hear from me in the morning.

12:53.950 --> 12:54.950
Why's that?

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
Because I can say "yes" now, sir.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.950
Ooh... 14 hour, 12 minute shift.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.950
Yeah! Apartment. Bath. Candles.

13:21.000 --> 13:21.950
Wine.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.950
I wish people would only get
ill for eight hours a day.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.950
What? It'd relieve the
pressure on the NHS.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.950
Well, funny you should say
that, because in Afghan...

13:29.000 --> 13:30.950
- Oh, during the war...
- Yes.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.270
Yeah... Heard it all before.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.950
I got made a rather
interesting proposition today.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.950
Oi, you're marrying me. Tell all
the other suitors to back off.

13:55.000 --> 13:55.950
Yeah, well, it's not that
interesting. It's, erm, work.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
Yeah, well, it's not that
interesting. It's, erm, work.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.950
A six-week humanitarian mission.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.950
Well, I hope you told
'em where to stick it.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
You're on a humanitarian mission
in Manchester, looking after me.

14:14.950 --> 14:15.950
Your eyes are rather beautiful.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.950
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.950
Well, the sclera of your eyes
are as white as virgin snow.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.950
- I can't... I'm sorry!
- What?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.950
Come on, you see, I try to be romantic
and you just throw it back in my face!

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
- Everything is just medical with you.
- Yeah, military with you, young lady!

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
It's six weeks. OK? You're
happy for me to go Kenya?

14:37.000 --> 14:39.950
What have they got in Kenya
they don't have in Preston?

14:40.000 --> 14:42.340
All right, don't answer that.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.950
And once we're married, I won't
be doing any more tours away.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
Maybe... Maybe we should set
a date... to get married.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.950
Look, I do want to marry you...

14:57.000 --> 14:59.950
I do, it's just... It's just
all the shiz that comes with it.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.950
- What shiz?
- Everything!

15:02.000 --> 15:06.950
- Yeah, but I thought after Sierra
Leone you were going to stay based
in the UK. - Yes, and I will be.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.950
You won't even know I've gone.

15:09.000 --> 15:09.950
Hmm?

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Yeah?

15:20.000 --> 15:23.950
I know I'm not exactly Sigmund
Freud or anything like that, but...

15:24.000 --> 15:26.950
it's pretty clear to me that you
are refusing to set a date for

15:27.000 --> 15:31.950
the wedding because you're shitting
yourself that Jamie's going to do an Elvis.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.950
What's doing an Elvis?

15:34.000 --> 15:36.070
"Forgetting" to turn up.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.950
Jamie's not going to do that,
Georgie, he dotes on you.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.950
So if you ARE going to
run off and abandon him,

15:43.000 --> 15:46.950
can you please let me know first?
Because... I'll be all over that boy.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.950
All right. I'll give you first dibs.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.950
Anyway, I'm not running away, Marie.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.950
You can't bullshit a bullshitter, Georgie.
I know exactly what's going on here, OK?

15:57.000 --> 15:58.950
I did GCSE psychology, don't forget.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.950
Yeah, and you failed it.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.950
So then why haven't you
told Jamie about Elvis?

16:03.000 --> 16:06.950
Look, do you mind buggering off so I can
concentrate on packing my kit, please?

16:07.000 --> 16:07.950
Ooh... Back of the net!

16:08.000 --> 16:11.950
What? You are running away, and
you haven't told him about Elvis.

16:12.000 --> 16:12.950
I don't give a toss about Elvis.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.950
I ain't thought about him in years so...

16:16.000 --> 16:16.950
Oh, really?

16:17.000 --> 16:19.950
Yeah, it's a six-week humanitarian
tour in Kenya, Marie, right?

16:20.000 --> 16:22.950
And once we're back, we'll
set a date for the wedding.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.950
OK, and that's when you're going
to tell him about Elvis, yeah?

16:26.000 --> 16:28.950
Do you tell all your boyfriends
about your previous relationships?

16:29.000 --> 16:29.950
No!

16:30.000 --> 16:32.340
And I didn't fail, I got a D!

16:33.000 --> 16:34.870
Yeah, for demented!

16:37.950 --> 16:38.950
What, into Nairobi?

16:39.000 --> 16:40.950
- Yeah.
- And then how many hours' drive?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.950
About six, seven.

16:43.000 --> 16:43.950
I bet. Bloody hell.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
Oh! I love a woman in uniform! Come here.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.950
- Let me see you.
- You used to love ME that much, Mother.

16:53.000 --> 16:53.950
In your dreams!

16:54.000 --> 16:55.950
You look gorgeous.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
- No, I do not. - Gorgeous. - Thank you.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.950
Right, guys, we're just going to
update you on our current situation

17:37.000 --> 17:39.950
and give you your missions and tasks.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.950
We're going to be heading
towards the Somali border, here.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.950
We'll be imbedded with the
Kenyan army, under the command of

17:45.000 --> 17:49.950
Captain Osman, who was,
incidentally, at Sandhurst with me.

17:50.000 --> 17:50.950
Firstly, welcome.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.950
I'm looking forward to working
with you over the next few weeks.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.950
We're going to be working
closely with the Kenyan NGO

17:57.000 --> 17:58.950
Kenya Crisis Care.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.950
They are working here at
the large refugee camp --

18:02.000 --> 18:06.950
a breeding ground for Al Shabaab.
Many NGOs have been killed,

18:07.000 --> 18:09.950
many more have fled, leaving
the camp very unstable.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.950
Primarily, we'll be tasked with
supporting the Kenyan army in

18:14.000 --> 18:16.950
restoring order and assisting
the Kenya Crisis Care with

18:17.000 --> 18:19.950
delivering medical services to
tens of thousands of inhabitants.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.950
The insurgents have a ready
supply of weapons from across

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
the Somali border and they
are proficient at making IEDs.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.950
We need to stay focused,
stay alert and stay alive.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.950
This is effectively a war zone.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.950
Therefore, whilst our mission
is primarily humanitarian,

18:39.000 --> 18:40.950
we need to protect ourselves.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.950
The situation on the Somali border
is anything but straightforward.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.950
When the Brits drew a
border between countries,

18:47.000 --> 18:48.950
they did it in a straight line...

18:49.000 --> 18:52.950
which has resulted in the
displacement of many ethnic Somalis.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.950
Generally, inside the camps here,
they are hostile to the military.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.950
Their men with guns
hate our men with guns.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.950
Pretty much.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.950
But also, the NGOs, needing to remain impartial
so they can function within the camps,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.950
cannot be seen as taking sides with us.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.950
Albeit we're there to help them.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.950
We don't want to add to the
confusion within the camp.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.950
We are there to help...

19:16.000 --> 19:19.950
then we will withdraw to a military
base three miles outside the camp.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.950
That's where we'll be based
and we'll move into the camp

19:23.000 --> 19:24.950
for a specific purpose.

19:25.000 --> 19:25.950
Any questions thus far?

19:26.000 --> 19:27.950
No, boss.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.950
Right, guys, get your heads down
tonight. Breakfast tomorrow at 0530

19:31.000 --> 19:32.950
then we move out at 0600.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Sir.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.950
I like our new medic, boss.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
I've got to hand it to you,
you've got moves like Jagger.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.950
What does that even mean,
Fingers, you weapon-grade scrotum?

19:54.000 --> 19:57.950
All right, I'm just saying,
hand on my heart, I've had worse.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.950
Oh, so we choose our medics
based on their appearance,

20:01.000 --> 20:01.950
like a beauty contest?

20:02.000 --> 20:03.950
I would.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.950
That's exactly what I'd do.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.950
That's cos you're a bell-end, Monk.

20:08.000 --> 20:08.950
Thanks, boss.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.950
When you're shot, you're
unlikely to have a hard-on,

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
so we choose our medics based on their
ability to deal with medical emergencies.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.950
I don't know, I reckon I'd
still have a raging boner.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
All we need now is to get you
shot, Monk, then we'll find out.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.950
And that will be arranged if you
two don't start getting a shift in!

20:28.000 --> 20:30.950
You two shitheads need
to switch on, sharpish.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.200
Sir.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.950
All right, babe, you need a hand?

20:37.000 --> 20:39.200
No, I'm all right, thanks.

20:40.950 --> 20:41.950
You married?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.950
Just thought I'd get
straight to the point.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.950
You'd better crack on, hadn't you?

20:46.000 --> 20:47.950
Crack on to you, that's what I'm saying.

20:48.000 --> 20:48.950
I'm engaged.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
And I'm here to work.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.400
Got that?

20:55.000 --> 20:56.950
I like you already.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.670
Welcome aboard.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.950
- Kicki, the soldiers are here.
- Did they bring the equipment?

23:35.000 --> 23:36.950
I'm sure. They're only
just parking up now.

23:37.000 --> 23:37.950
OK, let's go.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
- Everyone off. You all all right?
- All good, boss.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Hey.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.950
- Hey, Kicki, how are you?
- All right, and you?

23:50.000 --> 23:50.950
Good. Nafula...

23:51.000 --> 23:52.950
Captain Osman.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.740
Let me introduce you to Captain James.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.950
Right, C Operation now! Lane, on me!

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Help! Help!

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
- Approximately... - Kicki,
come on. - eight casualties.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.950
Lift them and get them
into triage. Quickly!

24:32.000 --> 24:33.950
Don't move them until
they've been assessed!

24:34.000 --> 24:35.950
Let's get 'em stable first.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.950
I need tourniquets and morphine
from my med Bergan... ASAP.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.950
Come on, move. We become a target here!

24:45.950 --> 24:46.950
Get down!

24:47.000 --> 24:48.950
Contact?

24:49.000 --> 24:50.950
Has anybody got eyes on?

24:51.000 --> 24:55.950
I think one shooter! No,
three, 200 metres, hillside!

24:56.000 --> 24:57.950
Don't shoot until you're sure!

24:58.000 --> 25:01.950
We need to get them extracted,
now! Into triage, quickly!

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Escort casualties!

25:06.000 --> 25:07.950
- Lift on three.
- Yeah?

25:08.000 --> 25:09.950
One, two, three... Go!

25:10.000 --> 25:12.950
Right, mate, we'll take over.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.950
Hi, sir. Hi, can you hear me?

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
- Can you tell me your name?
- Soon as he's off...

25:21.000 --> 25:23.950
- .. I want you back outside. - We're going
to get you to a doctor as soon as we can, OK?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.950
Put pressure there for
me, yeah? Push down.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.800
- One, two, three...
- Push down, yeah?

25:34.000 --> 25:36.600
We have to take his blood pressure.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.950
I have been in this camp for ten years.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.950
Which I think beats your seven minutes.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.950
I was worried, all right?

25:47.000 --> 25:48.950
If we moved him he would've bled out.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.950
Not moving them would have
resulted in a bullet in the head.

25:52.000 --> 25:52.950
For them as well as us.

25:53.000 --> 25:57.950
- We've got morphine so we can give them pain
relief until the doctor arrives. - Doctors(?)

25:58.000 --> 25:59.950
We... We treat them as best we can

26:00.000 --> 26:02.950
until it's safe to get the most
seriously injured to hospital.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.950
Where are the doctors?

26:05.000 --> 26:05.950
Gone.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Gone?

26:09.000 --> 26:12.950
German doctor was taken hostage
last week and the rest of her team

26:13.000 --> 26:14.950
withdrew to the hospital in the city.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.950
That's the reality...

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Lane.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.950
Kicki, we need you.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
- We have a head trauma that I
don't understand. - I'm here.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
What, from the fire? Why would
you have it from the fire?

27:14.000 --> 27:15.950
Right, night, lads.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
- Night.
- Goodnight.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.950
Give us a shout if you
get lonely, sugar tits.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.200
Monk!

27:28.000 --> 27:30.950
I don't want you to think I'm
a humourless Northern bird...

27:31.000 --> 27:33.950
but one more comment from you
and I will inject you with

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
a serum to make your cock shrivel
to the size of your brain.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.950
You just got told!

27:43.000 --> 27:44.950
She can handle herself.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.940
Oh, yeah, she's good.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.950
Like, everything's a bit out of control.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.950
'My grandparents went to
Kenya, said it was lovely.'

27:55.000 --> 27:57.950
Well, we're in a bit of Kenya that
I doubt your grandparents came to!

27:58.000 --> 28:01.950
'Can't be as bad as Afghan, can it?'

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
Erm... It's... It's different.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.950
'Are you OK?'

28:08.000 --> 28:08.950
Yeah, miss you.

28:09.000 --> 28:14.000
'I miss you too. Look, tell me
everything's all right out there.'

28:15.000 --> 28:16.950
Maybe I can do something good.

28:17.000 --> 28:17.950
Medic, are you decent?

28:18.000 --> 28:19.950
I've gotta go, OK? Love you.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.950
'All right. Stay safe.'

28:22.000 --> 28:23.670
Yeah, come in.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.950
Sorry to disturb you, Medic,
have you got any painkillers?

28:27.000 --> 28:28.950
Yeah, yeah. What's the matter?

28:29.000 --> 28:31.950
Oh, I've just got a headache.
It's the heat and lack of sleep...

28:32.000 --> 28:34.400
All right, keep hydrated, yeah?

28:36.000 --> 28:37.950
I just wanted to... check you were OK.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.950
You know, what with Kicki and that.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.950
I thought you were 100%
right, if that's any help.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.950
I'm fine. Thanks, Brains.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.950
You know, under normal circs we shouldn't have
moved those people till they'd been assessed.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
Well, I don't think that
normal circs exist round here.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.950
Everything all right here, Brains?

28:56.000 --> 28:58.070
Yeah, boss. Sorry, boss.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.950
Is everything all right?

29:04.000 --> 29:06.950
Yeah. Yeah. I'm just getting
everything ready for tomorrow.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.950
Do you think it's safe
to leave supplies in camp?

29:09.000 --> 29:10.950
Ah, we can ask Kicki about
that in the morning.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.950
Well, she has been here
for ten years, boss.

29:13.000 --> 29:13.950
I know!

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
I imagine six weeks is going
to feel like a lifetime to us.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.950
It's good to have you on the team, Lane.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.950
I was worried you might say no
because of the friends I keep.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.950
He's not Voldemort, you can
actually mention his name, you know.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.950
Well, it was horrible and I think
Elvis could have handled it better.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.950
It was the best thing
that never happened to me.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.950
Have you heard from Elvis at
all, caught up on his news?

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
Nope. Honestly, boss,
I'm so not interested.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.950
Look, I know he's a complete tosser but...

29:43.000 --> 29:44.950
But he's your mate. I know.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.070
Yeah, he's a good mate.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.950
Not a good boyfriend,
obviously, but as a mate...

29:50.000 --> 29:52.950
Can we... Can we just
get on with the tour?

29:53.000 --> 29:55.950
I realise he's your mate but can
we just shut the door on yesterday,

29:56.000 --> 29:57.950
please, boss?

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
Get some shuteye. Tomorrow
may well be momentous.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.200
Lane?

30:38.500 --> 30:39.840
Lane...

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Lane.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.950
Lane, you need to wake up.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.950
What's happened? What is it?

30:53.000 --> 30:54.940
They've taken Kicki.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.950
What do you mean?

30:57.000 --> 30:58.950
They smashed their way into
the Kenya Crisis Care base.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.950
She's been taken hostage by
terrorists as yet unknown.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.950
We need to get down there
and calm the situation.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.340
- ASAP, please, Lane.
- Boss.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.950
Right, guys, debus.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.950
We're supporting the
Kenyans with crowd control.

31:39.000 --> 31:43.000
Calm the situation and get these
people away from the med centre.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.200
Lane.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.200
'How?

31:54.000 --> 31:56.200
'How can anybody do this?'

32:00.000 --> 32:03.950
If you guys hadn't have come, maybe
none of this would have happened.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.950
Your presence with your guns
has stirred their anger...

32:08.000 --> 32:08.950
We're here to help.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.950
Well, it hasn't helped.
Everything's ruined!

32:13.000 --> 32:14.340
Look...

32:22.000 --> 32:23.950
I don't know how things are
ever going to get better.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.950
Or how to carry on any more.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.950
Right, guys, in here now!

32:28.000 --> 32:31.950
We'll bring in all med re-supplies,
get you back up and running.

32:32.950 --> 32:33.950
House party carnage!

32:34.000 --> 32:35.950
Learn when to keep quiet, Fingers.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.950
Right, you and Monk go and get a truck.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.950
Bring it down here and start
loading this up and get this place

32:40.000 --> 32:41.950
- cleared ASAP. - Sir. - Kingy.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.950
Right, fellas, you know what to do.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.950
Weapons and helmets down here,
let's get this squared away!

32:47.000 --> 32:49.950
Lane... Captain James.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.950
Intelligence suggests an
Al Shabaab-inspired group,

32:53.000 --> 32:55.950
but possibly a breakaway
faction working on their own.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.950
MoD up to speed on all events.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.950
Our special forces are
out looking already.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.950
We've got to get this facility
up and running today, boss.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.540
People will die without this care.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.270
You're in your own time now.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.950
They've been onto the Swiss Embassy.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.670
They're trying to contact her family.

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
But we're her family. I'm her family.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.950
You know, this was her life...

33:52.000 --> 33:54.950
We were all that she knew,
all that she cared about.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.670
Without her...

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
She'll be looking at
you to carry on, Nafula.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.949
Every minute of every
day, she was saving lives.

34:24.000 --> 34:28.000
We're not just going to let her
life's work go to waste, Nafula.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.949
Let's bring all the supplies in, yeah?

34:35.000 --> 34:37.400
See as many patients as we can.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.949
They took the computer.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
Kicki and others were working
on a database of patients...

34:45.000 --> 34:47.949
How long have you been working here?

34:48.000 --> 34:52.000
Not as long as Kicki,
but this is my life too.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.540
What's this?

35:01.000 --> 35:02.950
Kicki's Dictaphone.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Maybe it's not broken.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.950
Is that Kicki?

35:33.950 --> 35:34.950
Thank you, Lane.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.950
Boss. She was dictating
notes when they came in.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.950
She obviously had the
gumption to leave it running.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.950
Captain Osman will now be passing
this to Kenyan intelligence.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.950
Where is she, what are
they doing with her?

35:47.000 --> 35:49.950
Undercover Kenyan special forces
are imbedded in Al Shabaab.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.950
They'll find out where she's being
kept and we'll do all we can

35:53.000 --> 35:55.070
to bring her back alive.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.950
You don't exactly sound
massively optimistic!

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Right. On me.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.950
They're trying to stop a flood with...

36:13.000 --> 36:14.950
I dunno, a fishing net.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.950
We're here to do a job, Lane.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.950
Let's focus on the task in hand.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
I don't even know what
that means any more.

36:33.950 --> 36:34.950
What can I do?

36:35.000 --> 36:38.950
We need to do a quick assessment,
divide them into urgent and

36:39.000 --> 36:39.950
non-urgent cases.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.950
Urgent on the right and
we'll try to see them today.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.340
Life-threatening at the front.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.400
We're doing all we can, Nafula.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.740
- Mother with babies here...
- Go on.

36:56.000 --> 37:00.000
It's worse than Manchester Royal
Infirmary on a Friday night, mate.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.950
All right, boys, look, your
Amazon delivery is here.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.950
Guys, how about helping with the fridge?

37:10.000 --> 37:13.700
And the med kit needs to be
taken into the triage ASAP.

37:13.950 --> 37:14.950
You struggling?

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Shut up, Monk.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.950
We had one fridge all the
way through my childhood.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.950
You must have been poor, then, Dangles.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.950
I always thought we were quite rich
until I started going out with Glynis.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.950
You're joking! What's
wrong with Glynis, man?

37:30.000 --> 37:32.070
We've all seen Glynis...

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
Please keep calm.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.600
What is that?

37:42.950 --> 37:43.950
Is that a Tic Tac?

37:44.000 --> 37:47.950
Kicki's idea. Not everyone, but
some people just need a little pill.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.070
My mother, for a start.

37:50.950 --> 37:51.950
Really?

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
It seems to keep them quiet
and makes them feel better.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.340
Tic Tac!

38:02.000 --> 38:04.200
Good tac-tics, eh, Lane(?)

38:05.000 --> 38:07.800
Can you ask him how long he's had this?

38:10.000 --> 38:11.950
- Two years.
- Two years.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.950
Right, let's clean it up
and dress it as best we can.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.950
Have you got any antibiotics?
Just flip him over for me.

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
Going to flip you over, sir. There you go.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
Just hold that nice and tight
for me, there. Thank you.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Keep it down.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.470
Thank you.

38:45.950 --> 38:46.950
Thank you.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.070
No. Thank you, Georgie.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.950
Got a kid with a mouthful
of maggots, Medic.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.950
We're walking past this
kid and I smiled at him,

38:58.000 --> 39:00.950
and when he smiled back all
these maggots fell out.

39:01.000 --> 39:05.400
- Straight up, boss. - My dad was a
fisherman, boss. 24-carat maggots.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.400
We're here to help. Calm, calm.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
OK. Come here.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.340
OK. What's your name, darling?

39:23.950 --> 39:24.950
- Jomo.
- Jomo.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.950
- Jono?
- Jomo.

39:27.000 --> 39:27.950
OK, Jomo.

39:28.000 --> 39:32.000
Bit of a pen and ink in the old
north and south, eh, Georgie?

39:33.000 --> 39:34.950
OK.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.950
I'm going to look after your son, sir.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.950
Lie back for me, darling.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.950
There you go. Yeah. Open your mouth.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.540
Your mouth.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.070
Open your mouth for me.

39:56.000 --> 39:59.950
Yeah, the tooth is very loose.
I'm going to have to extract.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.950
Erm, will you get me some
lignocaine gel, please?

40:02.000 --> 40:03.950
Have you ever done an
extraction before, Lane?

40:04.000 --> 40:06.950
Erm, only on myself, but
I was seven years old.

40:07.000 --> 40:11.950
All right, I'll pull the tooth out, then we'll
flush the infected area out with saline, OK?

40:12.000 --> 40:13.950
- Can I have the forceps, please?
- Need a hand, Lane?

40:14.000 --> 40:15.950
Yeah, Monk.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.950
- There you go, darling, thank you.
- What do you want me to do?

40:18.000 --> 40:20.950
Just hold his head, very gently, yeah?

40:21.000 --> 40:21.950
There you go, darling.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.950
That's good, thank you.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.950
I'll try and get as many of
the maggots out as we can.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.950
OK, keep your mouth wide for me. OK?

40:29.950 --> 40:30.950
That's it.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.950
- You're going to be all right.
- You're going to be eating crisps in no time.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Shh, shh, shh.

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
There you go. A few more,
a few more, it's OK.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.950
That's it.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.950
Right, just keep him really still, OK?

40:50.000 --> 40:51.950
You're going to feel a
little tiny bit of pain

40:52.000 --> 40:53.950
and then you're going to be fine.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.950
Yeah, it's going to be over. Yeah? OK.

40:56.000 --> 40:59.950
Right. Monk, just hold his head
tight for me, yeah? Reassure him.

41:00.000 --> 41:00.950
What?

41:01.000 --> 41:02.600
Reassure him.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
Shh! Reassure him.

Monk, you've stopped singing.

41:25.000 --> 41:30.000
A maggot landed on my hand,
you threw me out of my stride.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.950
Did Kicki go home often?

41:37.000 --> 41:39.950
- Back to Switzerland?
- No.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.950
Why?

41:42.000 --> 41:43.950
There's never a quiet moment in the camp.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
How about you? Do you
manage to get back home?

41:48.000 --> 41:49.950
Let's just say that when
my grandfather passed away,

41:50.000 --> 41:53.950
we had an outbreak of malaria.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.950
You didn't go back home?

41:56.000 --> 41:58.070
I couldn't leave Kicki.

41:59.000 --> 42:03.000
You need to sort your work/life
balance out, young lady.

42:03.950 --> 42:04.950
What does that mean?

42:05.000 --> 42:08.950
Seriously, you need to
find some time for you.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.950
But there's work to be done.

42:11.000 --> 42:15.000
Well, are you going to get
married, have your own family?

42:16.000 --> 42:18.950
That's not for me to decide.

42:19.000 --> 42:19.950
Your parents?

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
No, Allah.

42:24.950 --> 42:25.950
Are you married?

42:26.000 --> 42:28.950
Erm, well, no, I'm engaged. To a doctor.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.950
He should come out here. Is he a nice man?

42:32.000 --> 42:36.000
Of course! I wouldn't be marrying
him if he wasn't pretty perfect.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
He's perfect?

42:42.000 --> 42:48.000
Yeah. Yeah, he is, Nafula.
Perfect for me anyway.

42:49.000 --> 42:52.950
I think I might end up married
to the Kenyan Crisis Care...

42:53.000 --> 42:54.540
like Kicki.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.070
Yeah, but look at Kicki.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.270
Sacrificed everything and...

43:04.000 --> 43:06.070
Life is about sacrifice.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.950
But it shouldn't be
about regret, should it?

43:12.000 --> 43:13.140
No.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.950
- Kicki's watch.
- Mm?

43:24.000 --> 43:25.950
This one.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
She was very proud of
that. It was very special.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.950
She said it kept absolute perfect time,

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
although she always kept
it five minutes fast.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.950
I need to go and see Captain James.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.950
Are you all right here
on your own for a sec?

43:41.000 --> 43:44.950
I'm hardly on my own... I've
half the Kenyan army outside.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.950
Jomo's father had that watch!

43:47.000 --> 43:48.950
Or one like it.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.950
No, I'm pretty sure it was that one, boss.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.950
It's not in our remit to start
investigating petty theft, Lane.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.950
But it's not exactly petty
theft, though, is it?

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
He must know something
about her abduction.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
Let's get Kenyan
intelligence to investigate.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.950
- We can't just abandon her, boss.
- We're not abandoning her.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.950
But it feels like she's
been abandoned to me.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.950
Then you don't understand.

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
Our sources are looking
at likely safe houses...

44:15.000 --> 44:17.950
So, are we going to investigate?

44:18.000 --> 44:21.950
Once we've ascertained
for sure, we move in.

44:22.000 --> 44:25.000
Your passion and your
information are appreciated.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.950
As I've already said, Lane,

44:28.000 --> 44:29.950
we're here to do a job on this camp.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.950
And that job is so colossal
we need to focus on that.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.950
And that job will be made a whole
lot easier if we find Kicki.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.740
Thank you, Lane.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.950
'There were these clowns
in the cancer ward today.'

45:06.000 --> 45:07.950
Clowns?

45:08.000 --> 45:09.950
'Yeah, yeah, but we're not
allowed to call them clowns.'

45:10.000 --> 45:11.950
Why not?

45:12.000 --> 45:14.950
'Well, cos so many people
have clown phobias.'

45:15.000 --> 45:15.950
So what do you call them, then?

45:16.000 --> 45:18.950
'Er... chuckle monsters.'

45:19.000 --> 45:20.950
You taking the piss?!

45:21.000 --> 45:22.950
'No!'

45:23.000 --> 45:26.950
All right, well... I think I might
have a chuckle-monster phobia.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.950
'Oh, yeah? Well, I think I might
become a chuckle monster.'

45:30.000 --> 45:31.950
Why not?

45:32.000 --> 45:34.950
If we're not careful, life's
going to slip through our hands

45:35.000 --> 45:35.950
without us realising.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.950
'Oh, what?!

45:38.000 --> 45:41.950
'What, do you... do you feel like
life is slipping though your hands?'

45:42.000 --> 45:43.270
Erm...

45:43.950 --> 45:44.950
Today I do, yeah.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.950
'Have you been putting your sunblock on?'

45:48.000 --> 45:50.270
Yeah... the sun's got to me!

45:52.000 --> 45:53.950
Let's just get married.

45:54.000 --> 45:54.950
As soon as I get back.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.950
'You serious?'

45:57.000 --> 46:00.950
Mm-hm! You know, I don't
want a huge thing.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.800
'I'm down for it.'

46:05.000 --> 46:07.540
How many babies we going to have?

46:08.000 --> 46:09.950
'I'll think about it and text you.'

46:10.000 --> 46:11.140
OK.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.950
Lane, you decent?

46:15.000 --> 46:16.950
- Got to go.
- Lane?

46:17.000 --> 46:19.140
Yes, boss. Come in, boss.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.950
As you were, Lane.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.950
- I've got some very interesting
intel coming in. - Boss?

46:27.000 --> 46:29.950
An eyewitness has seen a Western
woman being taken into a dwelling.

46:30.000 --> 46:31.950
Kicki?

46:32.000 --> 46:33.950
It's looking hopeful, Lane.

46:34.000 --> 46:38.000
And this individual has been
seen frequenting the place.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.950
Jomo's father.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.950
O Group, mission briefing 0600.

46:45.000 --> 46:45.950
Mission briefing?

46:46.000 --> 46:48.540
Need a combat medic. Full battle.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.950
Well done, Lane.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.740
Thank you, boss.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.670
Gents, sit up!

47:01.950 --> 47:02.950
Relax, guys.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.950
We're about to embark
on an operation to help

47:06.000 --> 47:07.950
Captain Osman and his men.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.950
Kenyan intelligence have
got eyes on this dwelling.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.950
It's an Al Shabaab dwelling
known to be frequented

47:14.000 --> 47:15.950
by Mr Sidiq, among others.

47:16.000 --> 47:19.950
He is well known around camp
and has many contacts there,

47:20.000 --> 47:22.950
that's why this morning's
operation needs to be swift...

47:23.000 --> 47:25.950
the element of surprise on our side.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.950
As the Kenyan army always do
the morning sweep around town,

47:29.000 --> 47:30.950
our presence will not be unexpected.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.950
Any questions?

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
No, sir.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.470
ETA two minutes. Focus on, guys.

48:38.950 --> 48:39.950
Prepare to move...

48:40.000 --> 48:40.950
Two alphas. Keep eyes on.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.140
'I repeat, keep eyes on.'

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Perimeter secure.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.950
Right, we're searching and
clearing. Charlie Fire team on me.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
Delta, right-flank it.
Prepare to move... Move!

49:24.000 --> 49:27.950
Lane. Two fatalities here
and attend to this one.

49:28.000 --> 49:29.950
Yes, boss!

49:30.000 --> 49:31.950
Delta Fire team, push up.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.950
Keep your hand pressed down firmly
on your neck for me, all right?

49:35.000 --> 49:37.540
There we go, keep the pressure on.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.140
Delta Fire team, push up.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.200
Cut!

49:58.000 --> 49:59.950
- Clear. - Clear. - Clear.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.950
Charlie team!

50:02.000 --> 50:05.950
Dangles, cover this door.
Mansfield, Monk, on me.

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
Eyes for hostage. Check for captive.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.950
(One, two, three...)

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Monk, on me.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.950
Move! Move!

50:18.000 --> 50:19.950
Move!

50:28.000 --> 50:30.950
- Go onto the balcony! - Balcony
clear. - Stand up slowly!

50:31.000 --> 50:34.950
- Stand up now! - Stand up... now!
- Get up, get your hands on your head.

50:35.000 --> 50:38.950
- Put your hands on your head.
- Turn tound now!

50:39.000 --> 50:40.950
Brains, turn him to me now.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Positive ID.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.950
Right, that's dressed, that
should staunch the bleed...

50:49.000 --> 50:51.740
Let's give you something for the pain.

50:54.000 --> 50:55.950
Dwelling clear!

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
Lane, need you.

51:01.000 --> 51:02.200
Jomo.

51:04.000 --> 51:07.950
Jomo. Jomo. Hey, it's all
right... Remember me?

51:08.000 --> 51:10.950
Remember me, yeah?

51:11.000 --> 51:13.950
We obviously had to search him in case
he was booby-trapped. Hence his distress.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.950
It's all right. Your father's
all right, I've seen him.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.950
He's alive, they're just taking
him to the police station.

51:19.000 --> 51:20.950
Does he speak English, Lane?

51:21.000 --> 51:23.600
You understand me, don't you, Jomo?

51:24.000 --> 51:26.950
It's all right. Let's
get you looked after.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.070
OK? Where's your mother?

51:30.000 --> 51:31.200
Dead.

51:33.500 --> 51:35.240
I'll be outside.

51:38.000 --> 51:42.000
All right... We'll take you
back to the camp, with Nafula.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.070
Do you remember Nafula?

51:46.000 --> 51:47.950
They're looking for a
lady from the camp...

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
Kicki. Do you know Kicki?

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Was Kicki here?

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Is she still here now?

52:02.000 --> 52:03.670
Where was she?

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Boss! Boss!

52:40.000 --> 52:43.950
Right, this is now a crime scene.
No-one contaminate anything.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.950
I'll leave the police here on guard.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.540
Let's get the injured to hospital.

52:51.000 --> 52:54.950
Kenya Crisis Care ambulance on
the way, boss. ETA three minutes.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.740
Nice one, Kingy.

52:58.000 --> 53:01.950
Right, guys, listen in.
Good work out there today.

53:02.000 --> 53:03.950
If I had to single out a man of the match,

53:04.000 --> 53:06.600
I'd give it to Lance Corporal Lane.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.950
- Thanks, boss. - You've always
had a thing for the medic, boss.

53:10.000 --> 53:11.950
Strike one, Fingers.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.950
- Sorry. - Her interventions
led to the arrest of several

53:15.000 --> 53:15.950
Al Shabaab figures in there today.

53:16.000 --> 53:17.950
This is exactly how it started with Molly.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.950
Strike two, Fingers.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.950
Right, guys, stay here.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Lane, on me.

53:29.000 --> 53:30.950
I'll need to go with him, boss.

53:31.000 --> 53:32.950
If he crashes and there's no-one
medical in the ambulance...

53:33.000 --> 53:34.950
You do know he's Al Shabaab, Lane?

53:35.000 --> 53:36.950
I need to keep him stable...

53:37.000 --> 53:38.950
get him to the hospital alive.

53:39.000 --> 53:42.950
We can't just let him
die, boss, whoever he is.

53:43.000 --> 53:46.950
Kingy, get 'em all loaded up, we're
escorting the ambulance to hospital.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.950
- Boss?
- Lane can't do this on her own.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.950
Mansfield, jump up front in the ambulance.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.950
Kingy, in front of the truck with me.
Eyes on the ambulance throughout. Let's go!

53:54.000 --> 53:55.950
Right, guys, you heard the boss. Let's go!

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Good luck, Lane.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.070
Right, that's all done.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.950
Shit.

54:24.500 --> 54:25.700
Fuck!

54:26.000 --> 54:28.950
- You all right back there, Georgie?
- He's crashed on me.

54:29.000 --> 54:29.950
Anything I can help with?

54:30.000 --> 54:32.950
Fuck all, mate. Let's just
get him to the hospital ASAP.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.600
Right, come on, put your foot down.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Slow down. Slow down!

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Watch out. Move!

54:48.000 --> 54:50.600
Get to the right. Get to the right.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
- What's he doing?
- No idea.

55:05.950 --> 55:06.950
What's going on?

55:07.000 --> 55:08.950
Is everybody OK?

55:09.000 --> 55:11.800
Captain Osman, find out what's going on.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.200
What the hell's he doing?!

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
- Contact.
- Yeah.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Take the doctor.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.950
Has anyone got eyes on Lane?

57:06.000 --> 57:10.950
'I am a British citizen being
held hostage and will be executed

57:11.000 --> 57:12.950
'at sundown tomorrow if
all Al Shabaab fighters'

57:13.000 --> 57:15.950
are not released.

57:16.000 --> 57:19.950
You release our fighters...
or we cut off her head.

57:20.000 --> 57:20.950
The situation has now escalated.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.940
We're soon to be joined by special forces.

57:28.000 --> 57:29.950
What's going to happen to me now?

57:30.000 --> 57:30.950
Pow!

57:31.000 --> 57:33.950
Please, I'm a medical person. I
can help you and your brothers.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.670
Please. Please!

58:10.950 --> 58:11.950
You're under arrest.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.950
You're going to prison.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.950
In what sense are you free?

58:17.000 --> 58:18.950
I live at a level of intensity

58:19.000 --> 58:22.000
unknown to you and others of your type.
