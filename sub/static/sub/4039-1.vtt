WEBVTT

00:16.306 --> 00:19.230
-ARE WE THERE, YET?
-ALMOST.

00:19.230 --> 00:21.852
WAIT, WE'RE NOT DOING THAT
BLINDFOLDED SURFING
THING AGAIN, ARE WE?

00:21.852 --> 00:25.146
'CAUSE THAT DIDN'T
EXACTLY END UP BEING
ONE OF YOUR BETTER IDEAS.

00:25.146 --> 00:27.818
FIRST OF ALL, THAT BUOY
HAD NO BUSINESS BEING THERE.

00:27.818 --> 00:30.451
SECOND OF ALL, NO,
WE'RE NOT GOING SURFING.

00:30.451 --> 00:33.324
AT LEAST NOT YET.

00:33.324 --> 00:36.787
OKAY.
DO YOU RECOGNIZE IT?

00:36.787 --> 00:39.500
-NO.
-NO?

00:39.500 --> 00:43.464
UNLESS IT'S THE GRASSY CLEARING
IN DOLPHIN'S COVE,
RIGHT BY THE LIFEGUARD TOWER,

00:43.464 --> 00:45.756
WHICH HAPPENS TO BE
THE EXACT SPOT WE MET

00:45.756 --> 00:49.340
THREE MONTHS AGO TO THIS DAY.

00:49.340 --> 00:52.343
TO THE MINUTE, ACTUALLY.

00:52.343 --> 00:55.136
(laughs) AT THE BEGINNING
OF WHAT'S TURNED OUT TO BE

00:55.136 --> 00:58.599
THE MOST BODACIOUS
SUMMER OF MY LIFE.

00:58.599 --> 01:01.772
EVEN THE PART
WHEN WE GOT TRAPPED
IN A 1960S BEACH MOVIE.

01:01.772 --> 01:03.484
(laughs)

01:06.317 --> 01:08.239
BRADY, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

01:08.239 --> 01:11.612
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING COOL
FOR OUR MEET-IVERSARY.

01:11.612 --> 01:14.535
IT ALL HAPPENED RIGHT HERE.
YOU WERE WALKING ON THE BEACH.

01:14.535 --> 01:16.907
I SAT THERE WATCHING
WET SIDE STORY
ON MY TABLET.

01:16.907 --> 01:20.501
AND I THOUGHT,
"WHO IS THE SURFER DUDE
WITH THE SHINY HAIR?"

01:20.501 --> 01:22.463
AND YOU SAID,

01:22.463 --> 01:25.085
"WANNA WATCH
THE AWESOMEST MOVIE
EVER MADE?"

01:25.085 --> 01:28.169
AND I SAID, "I DON'T THINK
'AWESOMEST' IS A REAL WORD.

01:28.169 --> 01:30.381
AND EVEN IF IT WAS,
THAT MOVIE'S DEFINITELY NOT IT."

01:30.381 --> 01:33.714
THEN I SAID,
"CHECK IT OUT WITH ME.

01:33.714 --> 01:36.517
"IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GOOD TIME,
I'LL BUY YOU A MANGO SMOOTHIE.

01:36.517 --> 01:40.100
EITHER WAY, YOU WIN."
AND...

01:40.100 --> 01:44.395
-AND I DO LOVE MANGOES.
-YEAH.

01:44.395 --> 01:47.528
YOU DID ALL THIS FOR ME?

01:47.528 --> 01:50.491
I'D SWIM
TO CHINA FOR YOU.

01:50.491 --> 01:53.073
OR HAWAII.

01:53.073 --> 01:54.825
OR WHATEVER'S THAT WAY.

01:54.825 --> 01:56.697
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT'S THAT WAY.

01:56.697 --> 01:58.539
(laughs)

01:58.539 --> 02:01.372
-YOU READY?
-MM-HM.

02:03.374 --> 02:05.416
(exhales)

02:05.416 --> 02:09.169
Tanner: IN A WAY, IT'S ALMOST
TOO BAD IT'S ALMOST ALL OVER.

WILL BE DIFFERENT
FOR US AT SCHOOL?

06:09.750 --> 06:14.254
WELL, WE WERE IN SCHOOL
ALL LAST YEAR TOGETHER.

06:14.254 --> 06:15.996
YEAH, BUT, AND WE NEVER MET.
THAT'S MY POINT.

06:15.996 --> 06:18.378
WE'VE ONLY KNOWN EACH
OTHER IN THE SUMMER.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.211
BRADY, IT'S US.

-MY NECKLACE.
THE ONE THAT LELA GAVE ME.

THE ONLY THING I HAVE
FROM WET SIDE STORY .
IT'S GONE.

06:40.360 --> 06:42.402
MAYBE IT'S STILL NEARBY.
SHOULD I DIVE FOR IT?

06:42.402 --> 06:44.865
NO, BRADY.

06:44.865 --> 06:46.987
THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO NOW.

09:01.331 --> 09:03.924
-AH!
-HEY, HOW WAS YOUR SUMMER?

09:03.924 --> 09:07.047
OH, BIG YAWN.
SCIENCE CAMP WAS EPIC,

09:07.047 --> 09:09.880

09:09.880 --> 09:11.471
I'M SO GLAD YOU

09:11.471 --> 09:12.843
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WOULD'VE DONE

09:12.843 --> 09:14.134
IF I'D LOST YOU

09:21.732 --> 09:23.233
SO, I STARTED
AN OCEANOGRAPHY CLUB.

09:23.233 --> 09:24.945
WHICH IS SUPER-CONVENIENT,
SINCE OUR SCHOOL

09:24.945 --> 09:26.607
-IS LITERALLY ON THE OCEAN.

09:58.388 --> 10:02.182
BOOK-BAG.
IT LOOKS VERY FULL OF BOOKS.

10:02.182 --> 10:05.856
AND HE DOESN'T SEEM
TO HAVE A BAG... AT ALL.

10:05.856 --> 10:08.939
I DO NOT HAVE A BAG.
I DO, HOWEVER, HAVE A PEN.

10:08.939 --> 10:11.942
-(laughs)
-HOW LONG HAS THAT
BEEN IN THERE?

10:13.573 --> 10:16.076
-WANT SOME?

WET SIDE STORY THEME PARTY?

14:19.029 --> 14:21.361
YOU COULD DO IT
AT THE BEACH.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.943
PEOPLE COULD
DRESS UP IN COSTUMES.

14:22.943 --> 14:24.444
YOU COULD EVEN PROJECT

I thought Lewis
was your middle name.

17:27.627 --> 17:29.469
It is Lewis,

35:38.096 --> 35:40.429

THEY CAN'T HANDLE THAT.

35:42.851 --> 35:45.474
-NO.
-WELL, THEN MAYBE WE JUST...

35:45.474 --> 35:50.148
WE JUST SHOW THEM THAT OUR WORLD
ISN'T AS GREAT AS THEY THINK
IT IS SO THEY WANT TO GO BACK.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.980
YEAH, THEN THEY'LL TAKE
THE NECKLACE IN THE OCEAN,

35:51.980 --> 35:53.572

SO, IF YOU'RE GONNA
COME TO SCHOOL WITH ME,

36:07.786 --> 36:12.791

45:29.227 --> 45:32.440
-MACK!
-OH, HI.

45:32.440 --> 45:34.022
UH, HI.

45:34.022 --> 45:36.694
-THIS IS, UMM...
-LELA.

45:36.694 --> 45:39.237
I'M HERE TO DISCOVER
WHO I AM AND FIND FULFILLMENT.

45:41.529 --> 45:43.701
A WOMAN THAT KNOWS
WHAT SHE WANTS.
I LIKE HER.

45:43.701 --> 45:46.785
-(giggles)
-I DID MY PHILOSOPHY CAMP THESIS
ON FEMALE SELF-EMPOWERMENT.

45:46.785 --> 45:49.327
I CAN REBUILD
A MOTORCYCLE.

45:49.327 --> 45:51.870
REALLY? I'M LOOKING
INTO BUYING A SCOOTER.

45:51.870 --> 45:55.213
I'D LOVE YOUR PERSPECTIVE
ON ENGINE TORQUE DIFFERENTIALS.

45:55.213 --> 45:57.585
OH, I CAN GO ON AND ON
ABOUT TORQUE!

45:57.585 --> 46:00.048
-(both laugh)
-Alyssa: OH, BYE, MACK!

46:00.048 --> 46:03.681
(scoffs) IT'S A DISASTER.
SHE LOVES EVERYTHING.

46:03.681 --> 46:04.973
EVEN MR. TERRY'S
CHEMISTRY CLASS.

46:04.973 --> 46:07.385
SHE TITRATED
HER SODIUM HYDROXIDE PERFECTLY

46:07.385 --> 46:10.228
AND LOVED THE WAY
THE RESULTING SOLUTION
MATCHED HER SHOES.

46:10.228 --> 46:13.151
WELL, I THINK
I'M WEARING DOWN
TANNER A LITTLE.

46:14.192 --> 46:16.484
NUGGETS MADE
OUT OF CHICKEN?

46:16.484 --> 46:18.987
AMAZING! (laughs)

46:20.158 --> 46:21.279
-OR NOT.
-(whimpers)

46:21.279 --> 46:23.161
DON'T WORRY,
I HAVE A PLAN.

46:23.161 --> 46:24.782
WE TURN THEM LOOSE, ALONE,

46:24.782 --> 46:28.746
IN THE MOST DANGEROUS,
CONFUSING, SCARY
PLACE IMAGINABLE.

46:28.746 --> 46:33.081
A PLACE WHERE
ONE FALSE MOVE RESULTS
IN EXILE, SHAME, HORROR...

46:33.081 --> 46:35.753
WAIT, WH-- WHERE?

46:37.045 --> 46:38.256
Brady:
THE CAFETERIA.

46:39.547 --> 46:40.919
(both laugh)

46:42.380 --> 46:44.973
-(screech)
-(laughing)

46:48.386 --> 46:49.637
OKAY.

46:51.269 --> 46:55.353
-HI, WE'RE NEW HERE.
-I COULD CARE LESS, SPRAY-TAN.

46:55.353 --> 46:57.565
(laughing)

46:57.565 --> 47:00.278
ACTUALLY, IT'S TANNER.
(laughs)

47:00.278 --> 47:02.490
NO SPRAY,
ADD AN "ER". TANNER.

47:02.490 --> 47:05.403
-(laughs)
TANNER LEWIS READY DANGER.
-(grunts)

47:05.403 --> 47:06.824
-OH, NO, I--
-(grunts)

47:06.824 --> 47:07.906
-WHA-- I--
-(grunts)

47:07.906 --> 47:08.947

47:08.947 --> 47:10.578
-I W-- TH-- B--

47:10.578 --> 47:14.332
GET OUT OF MY FACE.
(laughing)

47:15.333 --> 47:16.454
(grunts)

47:18.126 --> 47:21.880
-(grunts)
-TANNER, ARE YOU
GETTING THE IMPRESSION

47:21.880 --> 47:25.263
THAT PEOPLE HERE ARE
A LITTLE STAND-OFFISH

47:25.263 --> 47:27.385
AND, WELL, MEANISH?

47:27.385 --> 47:31.309
RIGHT?
AND ANGRYISH, TOO.

47:31.309 --> 47:35.353
LIKE THE BIKERS AND SURFERS,
ONLY ANGRYISHER.

47:38.106 --> 47:41.109
WHY IS EVERYONE
SITTING APART?

47:41.109 --> 47:43.741
WELL, COME ON, EVERYONE.
WHERE'S YOUR SMILE?

47:45.073 --> 47:48.616
-(laughs)
-IT'S SO EASY,
ANYONE CAN DO IT.

47:48.616 --> 47:51.289
-IT'S ATTACHED TO YOU,
HERE ON YOUR FACE.

WE'S CONFUSED.
-YEAH.

51:11.739 --> 51:14.652
-SPIT IT OUT.
-Cheechee: SPIT IT OUT.

51:14.652 --> 51:16.614
-SPIT IT OUT.
-SPIT IT OUT!

51:16.614 --> 51:17.655
LOOK!

51:17.655 --> 51:18.996

51:20.658 --> 51:25.583

US AND NEVER SAYS NOTHING,

51:25.583 --> 51:28.256

51:28.256 --> 51:30.128
INTO THIN AIRS!

51:30.128 --> 51:32.630
-LIKE A MAGICIAN...
-(gasping)

51:32.630 --> 51:35.803
DOING A MAGIC TRICK...
ON HIMSELF.

51:35.803 --> 51:36.844
(gasping)

51:38.266 --> 51:40.057
DUDE, YOU GOT
SOME BODACIOUS PIPES.

51:40.057 --> 51:41.389
YOU TOTALLY HAVE
TO BE IN MY SURF BAND.

51:41.389 --> 51:42.980
I PLAY A GNARLACIOUS
DIDGERIDOO.

51:42.980 --> 51:44.982
-(beatboxing)
-THANKS! WHY ARE
WE TALKING SO LOUDLY?

51:46.724 --> 51:49.647
-LATER, MY HOMBRE .
-SEE YOU LATER! OKAY!

51:49.647 --> 51:51.819
OH, LELA. HI.
UM... (clears throat)

51:51.819 --> 51:54.822
WANNA HANG OUT?
I'VE BEEN WORKING
ON SOME NEW LOOKS.

51:54.822 --> 51:58.866
CHECK 'EM OUT.
I CALL THIS ONE
THOUGHTFUL HANDSOME.

51:58.866 --> 52:01.869
THIS ONE'S SOULFUL SMOLDER.

52:01.869 --> 52:04.372
(laughs)
THOSE ARE WONDERFUL,
TANNER, BUT I CAN'T.

52:04.372 --> 52:07.505
WE HAVE CALCULUS HOMEWORK.
IT'S SO EXCITING.

52:07.505 --> 52:12.089
OH. OH, OKAY.
UH, WELL, HAVE FUN...
(chuckles)

52:15.173 --> 52:16.424
WITHOUT ME.

52:20.888 --> 52:23.221
WE'RE FURTHER THAN EVER
FROM TALKING THEM
INTO GOING BACK.

52:23.221 --> 52:25.022
YOU WATCH LELA,
I'LL WATCH TANNER.

52:25.022 --> 52:26.103
(sighs)

52:27.185 --> 52:29.227
I LEARNED ALL THESE
NEW THINGS, AND THEN
I WAS SITTING THERE,

52:29.227 --> 52:30.898
AND I'M LIKE, "HEY,
WHY DON'T I MAKE A NEW LOOK?"

52:30.898 --> 52:33.361
SO, I MADE A NEW LOOK,
AND IT WAS RENEGADE REBEL,
YOU KNOW?

52:33.361 --> 52:37.825
(laughing) AND THEN--
WHAT WAS THE OTHER ONE?
I CAN'T THINK OF WHAT IT WAS.

52:39.447 --> 52:42.580
OH, YEAH.
MYSTERIOUS WANDERER.

52:42.580 --> 52:44.121
AND THEN, UH, THINKING GUY.

52:44.121 --> 52:45.743
(laughs, screams)

52:45.743 --> 52:50.918
-HERE. CHECK THIS OUT.
-OH, THANKS. MM.

52:53.461 --> 52:57.425
OH. HI, MEDIUM-SIZED ME.
(laughs)

53:00.137 --> 53:01.429
STILL LOOKING GOOD.

53:20.408 --> 53:24.322
-BRADY, CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A SECOND?
-YEAH, SURE.

53:24.322 --> 53:28.496
UM, I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THINGS.

53:28.496 --> 53:31.749
AND I DON'T NORMALLY LIKE
TO THINK ABOUT THINGS.

53:31.749 --> 53:32.960
(chuckles)

53:34.382 --> 53:36.594
(clears throat) YOU SEE...

53:37.755 --> 53:40.718
I ALWAYS ASSUMED
LELA WOULD JUST
BE THERE FOR ME.

53:41.759 --> 53:43.761
BUT...

53:43.761 --> 53:47.395
THAT NIGHT WHEN
SHE RAN INTO THE WATER
WITH HER NECKLACE,

53:47.395 --> 53:49.847
IT GAVE ME
THIS STRANGE FEELING
IN MY STOMACH.

53:50.848 --> 53:52.310
IT FELT LIKE,

53:52.310 --> 53:55.353
LIKE WHEN I DRINK
A MILKSHAKE TOO FAST.
(laughs)

53:55.353 --> 53:56.484
(chuckles)

53:56.484 --> 53:59.527
IT FELT LIKE,

53:59.527 --> 54:01.569
LIKE THINGS,

54:01.569 --> 54:05.202
MIGHT NOT WORK OUT.

54:06.824 --> 54:10.037
(chuckles)
IT'S CALLED WORRY.

54:10.037 --> 54:11.789
YEAH, YEAH. THAT.

54:13.170 --> 54:16.213
AND, THE THING IS,
THINGS ALWAYS WORK OUT FOR ME.

54:19.377 --> 54:23.090
BUT, HERE, NOW,
I-- I STILL HAVE THAT FEELING.

54:24.141 --> 54:26.053
-WORRY?
-YEAH. YEAH.

54:28.265 --> 54:32.480
I'M WORRIED THAT LELA WANTED
TO COME TO THIS STRANGE WORLD
BECAUSE I WASN'T ENOUGH FOR HER.

54:33.891 --> 54:35.192
(chuckles)

54:39.567 --> 54:40.988
YEAH.

54:45.072 --> 54:48.576
I MEAN, I GUESS
ALL YOU CAN REALLY DO

54:48.576 --> 54:52.410
IS BE THE BEST
DUDE YOU CAN BE
AND HOPE THAT'S ENOUGH.

54:53.541 --> 54:55.042
IS THAT WHAT
YOU DO WITH MACK?

54:56.123 --> 54:59.677
UM, NOT--
NOT RECENTLY, NO.

55:01.298 --> 55:03.300
WE KIND OF HIT
A ROUGH PATCH.

55:05.343 --> 55:08.426
I'VE BEEN WORKING
ON SOMETHING I HAVEN'T
TOLD HER ABOUT YET.

55:08.426 --> 55:09.847
WHAT IS IT?

55:11.479 --> 55:14.101
(chuckles) COME ON.

55:17.645 --> 55:21.108
-ARE THESE SURFBOARDS?
-YEAH. THEY'RE ALL SURFBOARDS,
BUT PROTOTYPES.

55:21.108 --> 55:23.030
LIKE THIS ONE.
IT HAS ROTATING FINS,

55:23.030 --> 55:24.532
SO YOU CAN SURF
IN ANY DIRECTION.

55:24.532 --> 55:26.944
OR THIS ONE.
IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES.

55:26.944 --> 55:29.156
IT'S MY SURFBOARD SUITCASE.

55:29.156 --> 55:31.288
SO, YOU FOLD UP YOUR BOARD,
PUT IT IN YOUR BAG,

55:31.288 --> 55:33.541
AND IT GOES UP
IN THE CARRY-ON,
THEN, WHEN YOU LAND,

55:34.712 --> 55:37.084
-YOU'RE READY TO SURF.
-THAT IS SO COOL!

55:37.084 --> 55:40.167
-YEAH.
-WAIT, Y--
SO, YOU MADE ALL THIS STUFF?

55:40.167 --> 55:43.170
-UH-HUH.
-I'VE NEVER MADE ANYTHING.
WHAT'S ALL THIS STUFF?

55:43.170 --> 55:45.302
THIS ONE'S CRAZY.

55:45.302 --> 55:47.054
SO, YOU HAVE
TWO WATER INTAKES

55:47.054 --> 55:48.886
THAT LEADS
TO THE SEALED HYDRO-TURBINE

55:48.886 --> 55:50.968
THAT ALSO GOES
TO AN INTERNAL
LITHIUM ION BATTERY.

55:50.968 --> 55:55.142
THEN, WE HAVE
A PNEUMATIC ACTUATOR
THAT'S CONNECTED TO THIS HATCH,

55:55.142 --> 55:58.105
THAT MAKES IT OPEN
WHENEVER I WANT IT TO.

55:58.105 --> 56:01.188
UH, EVERYTHING
YOU JUST SAID,

56:01.188 --> 56:03.320
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT IT MEANS.

56:03.320 --> 56:04.902
(both chuckle)

56:04.902 --> 56:08.616
BASICALLY, THIS SURFBOARD
DOESN'T NEED ANY WAVES.

56:10.157 --> 56:12.249
WELL, THAT IS, IF IT WORKS.

56:12.249 --> 56:14.371
THAT'S SO COOL.

56:14.371 --> 56:16.333
WHY CAN'T YOU TELL MACK?

56:19.256 --> 56:22.590
BECAUSE...
I DON'T THINK
SHE'LL GET IT.

56:22.590 --> 56:26.173
YOU KNOW, ME SPENDING
SO MUCH TIME ON SURFBOARDS.

56:26.173 --> 56:28.766
SHE'S GOT
HER WHOLE LIFE MAPPED OUT.
SHE WANTS TO GO TO COLLEGE.

56:28.766 --> 56:30.848
COLLEGE? WHAT'S IT--

56:30.848 --> 56:34.011
WHERE IS IT-- WHAT'S A--
WHERE'S A COLLEGE?

56:34.011 --> 56:36.063
(sighs)
IT'S FAR AWAY.

56:36.063 --> 56:38.145
AND IT'S FULL
OF IMPRESSIVE PEOPLE,
LIKE HER.

56:38.145 --> 56:40.017
IT'S-- IT'S NOT A PLACE
WHERE A GUY LIKE ME

56:40.017 --> 56:41.729
COULD GET AROUND
BY MAKING SURFBOARDS.

56:41.729 --> 56:43.821
I UNDERSTAND, BRADY.

56:43.821 --> 56:48.986
MAYBE THE PROBLEM IS THAT
YOU'RE NOT TAN ENOUGH.

56:48.986 --> 56:50.828
(both laugh)

56:56.243 --> 57:00.127
MACK, I NEVER KNEW
I COULD BE SO HAPPY.

57:04.001 --> 57:06.343
I MEAN, I LOVE IT ALL,

57:06.343 --> 57:09.717
THE CHALLENGING CLASSES,
THE INTERESTING CONVERSATIONS,

57:09.717 --> 57:11.679
THE FLAVORED LIP GLOSS.

57:11.679 --> 57:14.221
I MEAN, REALLY.
TRIPLE VANILLA KIWI BERRY?

57:14.221 --> 57:16.223
(both laugh)

57:16.223 --> 57:18.435
I NEVER EVEN KNEW THERE WAS
MORE THAN ONE VANILLA.

57:19.607 --> 57:21.939
-CAN I--
-YEAH.

57:21.939 --> 57:26.824
UH, LELA, HERE'S THE THING.
OUR WORLD ISN'T REALLY
ALL THAT GREAT.

57:26.824 --> 57:30.568
OH, THERE'S FINALS,
AND TAXES, AND GLOBAL WARMING,

57:30.568 --> 57:32.910
AND HANGNAILS,
AND PUBLIC RESTROOMS.

57:34.031 --> 57:36.243
YOU REALLY HAD IT GOOD
BACK IN YOUR WORLD.

57:36.243 --> 57:40.457
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT YOUR FUTURE
OR PICKING THE RIGHT COLLEGE.

57:40.457 --> 57:42.249
YOU HAVE A BOY
THAT LOVES YOU.

57:45.132 --> 57:48.546
YOU HAVE A BOY
THAT LOVES YOU.

57:48.546 --> 57:51.639
RIGHT? AND YOU WANT
MORE THAN THAT, RIGHT?

57:53.851 --> 57:56.183
YOU WANT TO LIVE LIFE
TO THE FULLEST.

57:57.515 --> 57:58.686
I WANT THAT, TOO.

58:01.398 --> 58:03.811
BUT, LELA,
BEING WITH THE RIGHT PERSON

58:03.811 --> 58:06.694
CAN ACTUALLY
MAKE LIFE MORE FULL.

58:06.694 --> 58:09.486
IF YOU HAVE
THE SAME PASSION,
THE SAME DRIVE.

58:11.158 --> 58:13.160
OR, MAYBE THAT
DOESN'T HELP AT ALL.

58:16.534 --> 58:18.786
YOU KNOW, MAYBE HE JUST
HAS TO RESPECT YOUR PASSION

58:18.786 --> 58:20.708
AND NOT KEEP
SECRETS FROM YOU

58:20.708 --> 58:22.379
AND GET WEIRD
WHEN YOU'RE BUSY.

58:22.379 --> 58:24.672
I-- I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S ALL PRETTY CONFUSING HERE,

58:24.672 --> 58:26.423
WHICH IS WHY
YOU SHOULD GO HOME.

58:31.969 --> 58:33.931
WHAT?
WHAT'S WRONG?

58:36.053 --> 58:38.726
YOU LOOK NORMAL.

58:38.726 --> 58:40.267
-(phone rings)
-OH.

58:42.640 --> 58:43.771
HELLO?

58:43.771 --> 58:46.063

58:46.063 --> 58:48.355

58:49.446 --> 58:50.778

58:50.778 --> 58:54.491
-HI, MACK! (laughs)
-YEAH, WE'LL BE RIGHT OVER.

58:54.491 --> 58:56.363

THE WHOLE ESSENCE

59:54.091 --> 59:55.512
THEY COULD BE
STUCK HERE FOREVER,

59:55.512 --> 59:57.344
OR THE WHOLE FABRIC
OF OUR REALITY COULD
JUST RIP OPEN.

59:57.344 --> 59:59.386
-WE GOTTA GET THEM BACK.
-WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST TELL THEM

59:59.386 --> 01:00:00.517
WHERE THEY'RE FROM,
WHAT THEY DO?

01:00:00.517 --> 01:00:02.059
ARE WE WORRIED WHAT
THAT MIGHT DO TO THEM?

01:00:02.059 --> 01:00:03.600
WELL, WE'RE RUNNING OUT
OF OPTIONS, MACK.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.893
(sighs) LELA, TANNER.

01:00:05.893 --> 01:00:08.355
YOU'RE JUST MADE-UP CHARACTERS
FROM A MOVIE. YOU ARE NOT REAL.

01:00:08.355 --> 01:00:09.526
HUH?

01:00:11.148 --> 01:00:13.781
MAYBE I WOULD'VE
EASED IT INTO THEM
A LITTLE MORE GENTLY.

01:00:13.781 --> 01:00:17.785
BUT, UH, A MOVIE?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

01:00:17.785 --> 01:00:19.787

01:00:22.239 --> 01:00:24.041

01:00:28.956 --> 01:00:30.457
YOU GUYS ARE
FROM AN IMAGINARY WORLD.

01:00:30.457 --> 01:00:32.960
A MOVIE WORLD.
MY FAVORITE MOVIE.
IT'S WHERE MACK AND I MET.

01:00:34.011 --> 01:00:36.593
BUT, I DON'T WANT
TO LIVE IN A MOVIE WORLD.

01:00:36.593 --> 01:00:37.925
I-- BUT, YOU DO.

01:00:37.925 --> 01:00:39.927

IT'S WHERE YOU BELONG.

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:44.722
(sighs)
HOW DO WE
MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND?

01:00:46.223 --> 01:00:49.026

WHO JUST BLURTED IT OUT,

LIKE, "HEY,
LELA, GUESS WHAT?
YOU'RE NOT REAL."

01:06:47.003 --> 01:06:49.386
REALLY, SO THIS IS MY FAULT?
HOW ELSE SHOULD I HAVE SAID IT?

01:06:49.386 --> 01:06:51.178
I DON'T KNOW!
YOU COULD'VE BEEN
A LITTLE LESS DIRECT.

01:06:51.178 --> 01:06:54.891
LESS DIRECT, LIKE,
KEPT IT A SECRET FROM HER?
KEPT HER IN THE DARK?

01:06:54.891 --> 01:06:57.184
YEAH, 'CAUSE THAT'S
BEEN WORKING SO WELL
FOR YOU, LATELY.

01:06:57.184 --> 01:06:58.765
WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD
GO ASK SPENCER FOR HELP.

01:06:59.766 --> 01:07:01.938

WE'RE BACK TO THAT?

01:07:01.938 --> 01:07:04.351
HOW ABOUT THIS?
YOU JUST KEEP LOOKING

01:07:04.351 --> 01:07:06.143

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:15.072
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

01:07:15.072 --> 01:07:19.366
I THINK THEY WERE ARGUING.

01:07:19.366 --> 01:07:21.078
BUT THEY'RE NOT

01:07:22.749 --> 01:07:24.961

COUPLES DO IT, TOO.

01:07:29.086 --> 01:07:30.967
I DON'T LIKE IT.

01:07:32.509 --> 01:07:34.301

01:07:39.596 --> 01:07:41.438
(laughs)
WHY ARE THOSE CRAZY CATS

01:07:41.438 --> 01:07:43.270

01:08:44.831 --> 01:08:46.292

WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

01:08:46.292 --> 01:08:48.915

-Butchy: NO?

01:08:51.508 --> 01:08:53.750
I DON'T WANT
TO GO HOME, BUTCHY.

01:08:53.750 --> 01:08:55.801
BUT, LELA,
I'M YOUR BROTHER.

01:08:55.801 --> 01:08:58.515
DON'T YOU MISS ME?
DON'T YOU MISS ALL OF US?

01:08:58.515 --> 01:09:01.678
-YEAH.
-YES. OF COURSE. A LOT,

01:09:01.678 --> 01:09:06.973
BUT, WELL, I'M STARTING

BUTCHY. I'M HAPPY.

01:09:07.974 --> 01:09:09.685
OKAY, LOOK, LELA,

01:09:11.608 --> 01:09:14.191
BACK HOME, THINGS ARE
STARTING TO DISAPPEAR, LIKE.

01:09:14.191 --> 01:09:15.652
WAIT, WHAT'S DISAPPEARING?

01:09:15.652 --> 01:09:17.694
-PEOPLES.
-PEOPLES?

01:09:17.694 --> 01:09:19.656
YEAH, PEOPLES.
PEOPLES ARE JUST STARTING

01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:22.408
TO SPARKLE UP,
AND POOF, AND THEY VANISH.

01:09:22.408 --> 01:09:25.542
AND WE DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHERE'S TO
OR IF THEY'S COMING BACK.

01:09:25.542 --> 01:09:27.703
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.

01:09:27.703 --> 01:09:29.706
LELA AND TANNER ARE
THE STARS OF THE MOVIE.

01:09:29.706 --> 01:09:31.497
-WITHOUT THE STARS--
-THERE'S NO MOVIE.

01:09:32.589 --> 01:09:34.671
IT'S VANISHING
FROM EXISTENCE.

01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:36.843
YOU GUYS HAVE
TO GO BACK, RIGHT AWAY.

01:09:36.843 --> 01:09:38.054
YOU HAVE TO GO
BACK INTO THE MOVIE,

01:09:38.054 --> 01:09:39.796
OTHERWISE YOU'RE
ALL JUST GONNA DISAPPEAR.

01:09:39.796 --> 01:09:44.560
-WHAT HAVE I DONE? I--
-LELA. L-- IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:47.724
OKAY? THERE'S NO WAY
YOU COULD'VE KNOWN
THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

01:09:47.724 --> 01:09:48.765
I'VE GOTTA GO BACK.

01:09:50.015 --> 01:09:53.689

01:09:59.115 --> 01:10:00.697

01:20:32.328 --> 01:20:34.370
OF THAT TERRIFYING
WATERY STUFF.

01:20:34.370 --> 01:20:35.501

01:20:40.456 --> 01:20:42.588
OH, NO.
OH, NO, NO, NO.

01:20:45.591 --> 01:20:47.593
(ding)

01:20:47.593 --> 01:20:49.675

-BUTCHY!

01:20:49.675 --> 01:20:51.637
-HE'S GONE.
-WITH THE NECKLACE.

01:20:51.637 --> 01:20:53.809
GUYS, THERE'S-- THERE'S
NOTHING HERE BUT NOTHING.

01:20:53.809 --> 01:20:55.641
THIS IS HAPPENING.
HOW DO WE MAKE
THIS ALL RIGHT?

01:20:55.641 --> 01:20:57.313
HOW DO WE GET BACK
BEFORE WE ALL VANISH?

01:20:58.644 --> 01:21:00.897
WAIT, WHEN YOU GUYS
FIRST CAME TO OUR WORLD,

01:21:00.897 --> 01:21:01.938
YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE NECKLACE,

01:21:01.938 --> 01:21:04.240
'CAUSE I HADN'T
GIVEN IT TO YOU, YET.

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:05.571
HOW DID YOU GET THERE THEN?

01:21:17.333 --> 01:21:19.255
YOU READY?

01:21:19.255 --> 01:21:20.416

01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:26.762
-(overlapping chatter)
-Cheechee: THERE THEY IS!

01:21:26.762 --> 01:21:29.265
WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING
BEFORE WE ALL START
TO DISAPPEAR.

01:21:29.265 --> 01:21:31.717
-JUST LIKE BUTCHY.
-WE DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF TIME.

01:21:31.717 --> 01:21:33.389
-THIS SURFBOARD
WILL TAKE YOU HOME.
-ARE YOU SURE?

01:21:33.389 --> 01:21:34.810
YEAH.
I SURE HOPE SO. HERE.

01:21:34.810 --> 01:21:37.183
ALL RIGHT. GO PADDLE OUT
AND CATCH A REALLY
BIG WAVE.

01:21:38.274 --> 01:21:40.106
-OH, NO.
-THERE'S NO SURF.

01:21:40.106 --> 01:21:42.068
HOW CAN YOU SURF
IF THERE'S NO SURF?

01:21:42.068 --> 01:21:43.319
WELL, YOU CAN'T.

01:21:43.319 --> 01:21:44.900

-GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
-(ding)

01:22:02.959 --> 01:22:05.751
TANNER.
WE'RE THE ONLY ONES LEFT.

01:22:05.751 --> 01:22:07.803
WE HAVE TO GO. NOW.

01:22:07.803 --> 01:22:09.215
OTHERWISE,
WE'RE GONNA DISAPPEAR

01:22:09.215 --> 01:22:10.806
AND THE MOVIE
WILL BE GONE FOREVER.

01:22:10.806 --> 01:22:11.968
BUT HOW?

01:22:11.968 --> 01:22:13.429
YOU NEED WAVES TO SURF.

01:22:13.429 --> 01:22:14.971
TANNER, REMEMBER
WHEN YOU TOLD ME

01:22:14.971 --> 01:22:16.182
YOU'VE NEVER
MADE ANYTHING?

01:22:16.182 --> 01:22:17.893
-YEAH?
-I NEED YOU TO HELP ME
MAKE SOMETHING.

01:22:17.893 --> 01:22:18.934
OKAY.

01:22:18.934 --> 01:22:20.476
OKAY.

01:22:20.476 --> 01:22:22.438
HERE. TAKE THESE PLIERS
RIGHT HERE,

01:22:22.438 --> 01:22:23.899
AND YOU'RE GONNA
PUT IT UNDER THE EMBLEM

01:22:23.899 --> 01:22:25.361
AND YOU'RE GONNA
PRY IT OFF, OKAY?

01:22:25.361 --> 01:22:26.862
AWESOME.
COME ON, MACK.
WE GOTTA GO.

01:22:26.862 --> 01:22:28.274
-WHERE?
-TO MY HOUSE.

01:22:30.066 --> 01:22:31.867
-UNDER THERE,
AND I'LL PULL UP, OKAY?
-OKAY.

01:22:34.830 --> 01:22:36.622
-BRADY! BRADY!
-YEAH?

01:22:36.622 --> 01:22:37.994
I THOUGHT WE WERE
GOING TO YOUR HOUSE.

01:22:37.994 --> 01:22:39.335
JUST, COME ON.

01:22:39.335 --> 01:22:40.836
(both panting)

01:22:42.458 --> 01:22:44.710
(muttering)

01:22:44.710 --> 01:22:46.922
OKAY, UM, GLUE.
WHERE'S THE GLUE?

01:22:46.922 --> 01:22:49.005
WHERE'S THE GLUE?

01:22:49.005 --> 01:22:50.386
BRADY, WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

01:22:50.386 --> 01:22:53.139
IT'S MY WORKSHOP
SLASH CHILL OUT SPACE.

01:22:53.139 --> 01:22:55.141
AND ALL OF THOSE?

01:22:55.141 --> 01:22:57.093
SURFBOARDS.

01:22:57.093 --> 01:22:58.724
-AND YOU MADE THEM?
-UH-HUH.

01:22:58.724 --> 01:23:00.396
IT'S NOT AS HARD
AS IT LOOKS.

01:23:00.396 --> 01:23:01.767
ACTUALLY, IT'S PRETTY HARD.

01:23:03.979 --> 01:23:05.361
YES!

01:23:05.361 --> 01:23:06.442
OKAY.

01:23:06.442 --> 01:23:07.863
THIS WAS YOUR SECRET.

01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:15.241
YEAH.

01:23:16.782 --> 01:23:18.994
I'VE BEEN MAKING SURFBOARDS.

01:23:18.994 --> 01:23:20.376
BUT NOT JUST
ANY SURFBOARDS.

01:23:20.376 --> 01:23:23.249
BOARDS THAT DO
WHAT OTHER BOARDS DON'T.

01:23:24.830 --> 01:23:26.752
AND WHY COULDN'T
YOU TELL ME THAT?

01:23:28.674 --> 01:23:30.926
BECAUSE, MACK,

01:23:30.926 --> 01:23:32.798
YOU'RE SO TOGETHER.

01:23:32.798 --> 01:23:34.970
COLLEGE,
YOUR OCEANOGRAPHY CLUB.

01:23:36.052 --> 01:23:38.134
YOU'VE GOT A VISION
FOR YOUR LIFE
AND YOUR FUTURE.

01:23:40.186 --> 01:23:41.897
I JUST THOUGHT THAT,

01:23:41.897 --> 01:23:43.229
I DON'T KNOW,

01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:45.771
YOU WOULDN'T RESPECT IT.

01:23:45.771 --> 01:23:48.524
BRADY, THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

01:23:48.524 --> 01:23:50.606
MY GRANDFATHER
HAS MADE BOARDS
HIS WHOLE LIFE.

01:23:50.606 --> 01:23:52.027
IT'S AN ART.

01:23:52.027 --> 01:23:53.949
AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE,

01:23:53.949 --> 01:23:54.990
(sighs)

01:23:56.202 --> 01:23:58.614
THIS IS A VISION
FOR YOUR LIFE.

01:24:00.416 --> 01:24:01.657
YOU REALLY THINK SO?

01:24:01.657 --> 01:24:02.828
YEAH, I DO.

01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:05.541
GOOD, 'CAUSE...

01:24:09.545 --> 01:24:11.257
I'VE BEEN BUILDING
THIS ONE FOR US.

01:24:12.548 --> 01:24:14.049
REMEMBER IN THE SUMMER
WHEN WE COULDN'T SURF

01:24:14.049 --> 01:24:16.382
'CAUSE THERE WERE
NO WAVES?

01:24:16.382 --> 01:24:17.803
I HAD THIS IDEA THAT...

01:24:18.934 --> 01:24:20.936
WHAT IF YOU COULD
SURF WITH NO WAVES?

01:24:22.438 --> 01:24:24.560
THIS SURFBOARD
HAS A MOTOR BUILT
INSIDE IT.

01:24:25.561 --> 01:24:27.273
SO YOU CAN SURF
WHEN THERE'S NO SURF!

01:24:27.273 --> 01:24:29.645
EXACTLY.
NO MATTER WHAT.
ANY TIME.

01:24:29.645 --> 01:24:32.148
BRADY, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

01:24:32.148 --> 01:24:33.529
IF THIS BABY WORKS...

01:24:34.690 --> 01:24:36.652
WE MIGHT HAVE A SHOT
AT GETTING TANNER
AND LELA HOME.

01:24:39.034 --> 01:24:40.826
-LET'S DO IT.
-BRADY.

01:24:43.959 --> 01:24:45.331
I'M SORRY.

01:24:47.663 --> 01:24:50.206
I'M SORRY YOU FELT
LIKE YOU HAD TO
HIDE THIS FROM ME.

01:24:51.757 --> 01:24:53.879
YOU KNOW WHAT
REALLY MATTERS
ABOUT OUR FUTURE?

01:24:57.593 --> 01:24:58.764
NO SECRETS.

01:25:01.927 --> 01:25:03.058
DONE.

01:25:06.222 --> 01:25:08.604
-LET'S GO.
-OKAY.

01:25:11.357 --> 01:25:12.728
LOOK AT THAT.
WE DID IT!

01:25:12.728 --> 01:25:14.029
Brady:
GUYS! GUYS!

01:25:16.862 --> 01:25:18.154
WE GOT THE EMBLEM OFF IT.

01:25:18.154 --> 01:25:21.197
HEY, IT'S-- THIS IS
THE HYDRO-LITHIUM BOARD.

01:25:21.197 --> 01:25:22.828
THE ONE THAT CAN
SURF BY ITSELF.

01:25:24.039 --> 01:25:25.911
THE BOARD THAT CAN
SURF BY ITSELF!

01:25:25.911 --> 01:25:28.504
EXACTLY! HERE,
I'VE GOT THIS TIRE GLUE
THAT SHOULD DO THE TRICK.

01:25:28.504 --> 01:25:29.705
OKAY.

01:25:32.838 --> 01:25:34.250
OKAY, HELP ME, TANNER.

01:25:46.562 --> 01:25:47.853
WE GOTTA GET THIS BOARD
IN THE WATER.

01:25:47.853 --> 01:25:48.934
COME ON. LET'S GO.

01:25:48.934 --> 01:25:50.476
-WILL YOU GRAB THAT END?
-YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

01:25:50.476 --> 01:25:52.318
-YOU GOT IT?
-YEAH.

01:25:55.941 --> 01:25:57.363
YOU OKAY?

01:25:58.444 --> 01:26:00.035
BRADY, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE WE ARE?

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:06.161
(chuckles) YEAH.

01:26:06.161 --> 01:26:07.833
WE'RE AT DOLPHIN'S COVE.

01:26:09.164 --> 01:26:10.666
WHERE WE MET.

01:26:16.552 --> 01:26:18.634
BRADY, IF THIS DOESN'T WORK,

01:26:18.634 --> 01:26:19.965
AND LELA AND TANNER VANISH

01:26:19.965 --> 01:26:21.507
AND THE WHOLE MOVIE
NEVER EVEN EXISTED,

01:26:21.507 --> 01:26:23.599
THEN DOESN'T THAT MEAN

01:26:23.599 --> 01:26:25.180
TH- THAT WE NEVER EVEN MET?

01:26:26.432 --> 01:26:28.934
IF THEY DON'T MAKE IT,
THEN WE WON'T EVEN

THANKS FOR COMING.

01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:46.532
WE NEEDED IT.

01:28:46.532 --> 01:28:48.033
YOU'RE WELCOME, BRADY.

01:28:59.835 --> 01:29:02.918
HEY, I'M REALLY GLAD
I GOT TO SEE YOU AGAIN, LELA.

01:29:02.918 --> 01:29:04.840

WHEN YOU GET BACK
TO YOUR WORLD,

01:29:16.732 --> 01:29:18.564
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
THE WAY IT WAS.

01:29:18.564 --> 01:29:21.937
OKAY? YOU CAN
START A MATH CLUB.

01:29:21.937 --> 01:29:26.151

OF LIP GLOSS.

01:29:26.151 --> 01:29:28.073

OKAY, MAKE SURE
YOU BEND YOUR KNEES
WHEN YOU RIDE THIS THING

01:30:40.476 --> 01:30:41.817
OR ELSE YOU'RE
GONNA FALL RIGHT OFF.

01:30:41.817 --> 01:30:43.769

01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:47.152
-OKAY.
-YOU GUYS GOOD?

01:30:48.363 --> 01:30:50.115

-BRADY, WHAT'S WRONG?
-WHOA. WHAT IS IT?

01:31:07.583 --> 01:31:09.384
I DON'T KNOW.

01:31:09.384 --> 01:31:10.546
COME ON.

01:31:24.019 --> 01:31:25.230
WHAT?

01:31:25.230 --> 01:31:27.232
THE HATCH WON'T OPEN.

01:31:27.232 --> 01:31:28.774
Lela:
BRADY, WE'VE
GOTTA GO NOW.

01:31:37.112 --> 01:31:38.744
NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO!

01:31:38.744 --> 01:31:40.536
BRADY, IT'S HAPPENING.

01:31:49.004 --> 01:31:50.716
(engine sputters)

01:31:57.472 --> 01:31:58.894
I CAN'T GET IT.
I NEED MY TOOL KIT.

01:31:58.894 --> 01:32:00.636
I NEED A SMALL,
LITTLE SCREWDRIVER.

01:32:00.636 --> 01:32:02.057
I CAN'T GET IN THERE
WITH MY FINGERS.

01:32:02.057 --> 01:32:03.559
-I-- I NEED SOME HELP.
-OKAY, BRADY, BRADY.

01:32:03.559 --> 01:32:05.100
TRY THIS.

01:32:06.521 --> 01:32:08.443
-PLEASE HURRY.
-WE'VE GOT TO GO!

01:32:26.121 --> 01:32:27.542
PLEASE WORK.

01:32:30.626 --> 01:32:32.047
-YOU READY?
-Tanner: GO!

01:32:34.169 --> 01:32:35.470
COME ON, BABY.

01:32:52.988 --> 01:32:54.990
Mack:
Brady, if this
doesn't work,

01:32:54.990 --> 01:32:57.823
and Lela and Tanner vanish
and the whole movie
never existed,

01:32:57.823 --> 01:33:00.956
then doesn't that mean
we never even met?

01:33:00.956 --> 01:33:03.869
If they don't make it,
then we won't even
know each other.

01:33:03.869 --> 01:33:06.461
(echoing)
Know each other.
Know each other.

01:33:37.322 --> 01:33:39.234
YO! BRO-HEIM!

01:33:40.906 --> 01:33:42.577
WAS I RIGHT
OR WAS I RIGHT, DUDE?

01:33:42.577 --> 01:33:44.449
I TOLD YOU.
NIGHT BODY-SURFING?

01:33:44.449 --> 01:33:46.331
-MONDO SPIRITUAL, RIGHT?
-I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

01:33:46.331 --> 01:33:48.243
IT WAS SUPER FLAT.

01:33:48.243 --> 01:33:49.624
AND FREEZING.

01:33:49.624 --> 01:33:51.296
I DIDN'T CATCH
A SINGLE THING,

01:33:51.296 --> 01:33:52.668
EXCEPT MAYBE A COLD.

01:33:52.668 --> 01:33:54.629
-MY BAD, DUDE.
-IT'S ALL GOOD.

01:33:54.629 --> 01:33:55.961
HEY, YOU READY TO ROLL?

01:33:55.961 --> 01:33:57.342
-YEAH, LET'S DO THIS.
-COOL, MAN.

01:33:57.342 --> 01:33:59.054
NIGHT BODY-SURFING
IS STILL COOL, THOUGH.

01:33:59.054 --> 01:34:00.305
YEAH, YEAH.

01:34:00.305 --> 01:34:02.057

01:34:02.057 --> 01:34:03.679
Devon: IT'S THAT

01:34:03.679 --> 01:34:05.020
THERE WERE FLYERS
AT SCHOOL.

01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:06.521
THEY'RE GONNA
PROJECT A MOVIE?

01:34:07.602 --> 01:34:10.065
THAT LOOKS SUPER AWESOME.
YOU WANT TO CRASH IT?

01:34:10.065 --> 01:34:12.107
WHEN HAVE YOU KNOWN ME
TO PASS UP ON
A POSSIBLE FIESTA ?

01:34:12.107 --> 01:34:14.149

AND THEY SHOULD EACH BE
IN BATCHES OF TEN.

01:34:34.499 --> 01:34:36.051
AND THERE SHOULD BE
AT LEAST 100 ALL TOGETHER.

01:34:36.051 --> 01:34:37.172
SOME OF THEM WENT ROGUE,

01:34:37.172 --> 01:34:39.294
SO YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO RE-TIE THEM
WITH THE YELLOW STRING...

01:34:39.294 --> 01:34:41.426
-CAN WE HELP YOU GUYS?
-Boy: TWO TICKETS, PLEASE.

-THANKS.

01:34:46.932 --> 01:34:48.143
MACK!
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

01:34:48.143 --> 01:34:49.264
I JUST NEEDED SOME AIR.

01:34:49.264 --> 01:34:51.476
OH, SALES ARE THROUGH THE ROOF.

01:34:51.476 --> 01:34:54.609
-YOU'RE A GENIUS.
PEOPLE LOVE THE THEME.
-Girl: TWO TICKETS, PLEASE.

01:34:54.609 --> 01:34:58.363
HEY, HEY, HEY.
PARTY FOR ONE FOR
THE BIG SHINDIG TONIGHT.

01:34:58.363 --> 01:35:00.195
Boy: HEY, DEVON!
WHAT'S UP?

01:35:00.195 --> 01:35:01.867
CAN I HELP YOU?

01:35:01.867 --> 01:35:04.319
YEAH, I GOT TO ASK,
WHAT'S WITH THE BIG SCREEN

01:35:04.319 --> 01:35:05.700
AND THE OUTFITS?

01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:08.083
IT'S A FUNDRAISER. YEAH,
WE'RE SAVING THE BEACH.

01:35:08.083 --> 01:35:10.285
IT'S A 1962
BEACH MOVIE PARTY.

01:35:10.285 --> 01:35:12.417
COOL. WHAT MOVIE ARE
YOU GOING TO PLAY?

01:35:14.129 --> 01:35:15.881
LELA: QUEEN OF THE BEACH.

01:35:15.881 --> 01:35:17.132
NICE.

01:35:17.132 --> 01:35:19.835
-YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT?
-NO, I'VE HEARD OF IT.

01:35:19.835 --> 01:35:20.966
EVERYONE'S HEARD OF IT.

01:35:20.966 --> 01:35:23.468
SO, THEN WE AGREE THAT
IT'S THE AWESOMEST
MOVIE EVERY MADE.

01:35:23.468 --> 01:35:26.762
I'M NOT SURE
AWESOMEST IS A REAL WORD.

01:35:26.762 --> 01:35:28.183
AND EVEN IF IT WAS,

01:35:28.183 --> 01:35:30.645
I'M NOT SURE THAT MOVIE
IS EXACTLY MY JAM.

01:35:30.645 --> 01:35:33.688
BUT THAT MOVIE WAS TOTALLY
AHEAD OF ITS TIME.

01:35:33.688 --> 01:35:35.650
IT'S THE REASON
I LOVE TO SURF.

01:35:35.650 --> 01:35:37.442
YOU SURF?

01:35:37.442 --> 01:35:38.523
OF COURSE.

01:35:38.523 --> 01:35:39.905
COOL.

01:35:41.196 --> 01:35:42.778
(laughs) OKAY, HOW ABOUT THIS?

01:35:42.778 --> 01:35:44.699
YOU TAKE A TICKET,
SAVE THE BEACH,

01:35:44.699 --> 01:35:46.822
AND IF YOU DON'T
TOTALLY DIG IT,

01:35:46.822 --> 01:35:48.243
I'LL BUY YOU
A MANGO SMOOTHIE.

01:35:48.243 --> 01:35:50.125
I DO LOVE MANGOES.

01:35:50.125 --> 01:35:52.247
THEN YOU'RE GONNA
WIN EITHER WAY.

01:35:59.544 --> 01:36:01.136
THANKS.

01:36:04.049 --> 01:36:06.011
OH, HI.

SPEAKING OF MANGOES,

01:36:09.935 --> 01:36:11.807
I'M GONNA GO

OKAY, MACK,
YOU ARE GONNA
DO SO GOOD.

01:36:16.231 --> 01:36:18.393
THIS IS SO EXCITING.
AND IT'S NOT
AS SCARY AS YOU THINK.

01:36:18.393 --> 01:36:20.605
IT'S ONLY A LITTLE BIT
MORE SCARY THAN YOU THINK.

01:36:20.605 --> 01:36:22.067
-JUST BE CALM AND--
-ALYSSA. ALYSSA.

01:36:22.067 --> 01:36:23.658
