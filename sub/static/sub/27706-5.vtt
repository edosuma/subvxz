WEBVTT

00:00.958 --> 00:03.320
Previously on The Passage...
This could alter

00:03.323 --> 00:04.913
the course of Elizabeth's Alzheimer's.

00:04.916 --> 00:06.006
This is for you.

00:06.009 --> 00:07.516
No, this is for you.

00:07.519 --> 00:08.570
She's ten.

00:08.572 --> 00:10.354
She needs fresh air.

00:10.357 --> 00:12.240
Now we have a bird's-eye
view of Project Noah.

00:12.242 --> 00:14.051
Sierra Thompson died earlier today

00:14.054 --> 00:15.409
in a single-car accident.

00:15.412 --> 00:16.712
They killed her.

00:17.703 --> 00:19.114
Why did you change your mind

00:19.116 --> 00:20.348
about the execution?

00:21.785 --> 00:23.986
We've got $36 million
invested per viral.

00:23.988 --> 00:26.286
Guess nobody wants to set
that much cash on fire.

00:26.288 --> 00:27.922
There's a guy on the roof.

00:30.292 --> 00:32.994
Amy, Amy.

00:32.996 --> 00:36.018
The virals aren't gonna break
out. We're gonna let 'em out.

00:36.021 --> 00:36.931
No!

00:36.933 --> 00:38.432
I don't want to die.
Then don't.

00:38.434 --> 00:40.768
Anthony!

00:41.804 --> 00:43.538
Whose blood is that?

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:00.522 --> 01:02.055
Who's that?

01:02.057 --> 01:03.322
Horace Guilder.

01:03.324 --> 01:06.359
Deputy director, Department of Defense.

01:06.361 --> 01:07.794
You had a rough week, Mark.

01:07.796 --> 01:09.596
What the hell's going on around here?

01:09.598 --> 01:11.665
We're in uncharted territory.

01:14.402 --> 01:16.670
We need to make this thing work.

01:16.672 --> 01:18.805
We're a billion dollars in.

01:18.807 --> 01:21.741
I need some kind of positive result.

01:21.743 --> 01:23.376
Understood.

01:23.378 --> 01:25.714
He created several very expensive

01:25.717 --> 01:27.894
tactical technology programs.

01:27.897 --> 01:31.350
He's famous for taking
credit and avoiding blame.

01:31.352 --> 01:34.687
My bet is that he's here because
of what happened to Paulson.

01:34.689 --> 01:36.889
I don't like it.

01:36.891 --> 01:38.557
You want me to keep going?

01:38.559 --> 01:39.825
No.

01:39.827 --> 01:41.894
I just like to know the score.

01:41.896 --> 01:44.063
We have that in common.

01:53.474 --> 01:56.675
How do you feel about getting
the hell out of this place?

01:56.677 --> 01:58.243
You got a plan?

01:58.245 --> 01:59.917
I know you have a relationship

01:59.920 --> 02:01.619
with him, but why is Brad Wolgast

02:01.622 --> 02:03.353
running around like
he's back on the team?

02:03.356 --> 02:04.655
The consensus was that

02:04.658 --> 02:06.216
it made the little
girl more comfortable.

02:06.218 --> 02:08.286
What's her name again?
Amy.

02:08.288 --> 02:09.854
Amy.

02:09.856 --> 02:11.623
When we were up in that tree house,

02:11.625 --> 02:13.758
I saw that there's a door
outside the mess hall.

02:13.760 --> 02:16.128
The cooks prop it open to smoke.

02:16.130 --> 02:17.940
Smoking is gross.

02:17.943 --> 02:19.397
It is. Never do it.

02:19.399 --> 02:23.074
So they probably disabled
the alarm on that door,

02:23.077 --> 02:25.337
which means...
We use it to sneak out.

02:25.339 --> 02:27.539
Then what? We're just standing outside.

02:28.775 --> 02:31.176
Use that brain.

02:31.178 --> 02:33.978
The slimy old pipe on
the edge of the lawn?

02:33.980 --> 02:35.880
It's not slimy, and it's not a pipe.

02:35.882 --> 02:37.428
It's a drainage tunnel.

02:37.431 --> 02:39.431
It's probably been out
of service for years.

02:39.434 --> 02:41.519
It'll take us out of here.
What about spiders?

02:41.521 --> 02:42.787
There are no spiders.

02:42.789 --> 02:44.055
Brown widows.

02:44.057 --> 02:46.157
You're thinking about them right now.

02:46.159 --> 02:48.092
The webs getting in your mouth

02:48.094 --> 02:49.560
and your face while you're crawling

02:49.562 --> 02:52.096
through that slimy tunnel.
Okay, stop.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.532
You in or out?

02:55.535 --> 02:57.635
I'm in.

02:57.637 --> 03:00.157
I need to meet with Amy alone.

03:00.160 --> 03:02.439
Get Wolgast away from her.

03:07.480 --> 03:11.149
Can I say again that I think
what you're doing is insane?

03:11.151 --> 03:14.185
I was exposed to Carter's blood.

03:14.187 --> 03:17.154
So if I turn...
You're not gonna turn.

03:17.156 --> 03:19.455
The safest place for me is 4B.

03:19.458 --> 03:22.559
I'm not gonna be responsible
for another person's death.

03:22.561 --> 03:24.061
Plus...

03:24.063 --> 03:26.663
takes me out of commission
while Guilder's here.

03:27.800 --> 03:30.266
I'd rather be down with the vampires.

03:30.268 --> 03:32.169
We don't say "vampire."

03:32.171 --> 03:33.770
Whatever.

03:37.176 --> 03:39.509
What are you gonna tell Guilder?

03:39.511 --> 03:41.678
The truth.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.181
We used science we didn't understand

03:44.183 --> 03:46.650
to create a lethal
species with superpowers

03:46.653 --> 03:49.886
that we can't control, who
seem hell-bent on destroying us.

03:49.888 --> 03:51.554
Oops.

03:52.825 --> 03:54.224
Yeah.
Mm.

03:54.226 --> 03:56.526
Let me know how that goes.

03:58.062 --> 04:00.430
Listen.

04:00.432 --> 04:01.764
If I turn...

04:01.767 --> 04:03.766
You're not gonna turn.

04:03.768 --> 04:05.341
If I turn...

04:05.344 --> 04:06.802
I got you.

04:08.406 --> 04:09.606
One shot.

04:09.608 --> 04:12.275
Right there. I'll do it myself.

04:12.277 --> 04:14.344
Don't wait.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.180
You're ready for quarantine.

04:20.779 --> 04:24.881
There's someone I need
to see before I go.

05:13.629 --> 05:18.556
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

05:33.171 --> 05:35.296
We shouldn't stop for long.

05:35.298 --> 05:37.965
Where are we?

05:37.967 --> 05:40.468
Lacey, are you okay?

05:40.470 --> 05:44.537
I feel like something
terrible is gonna happen.

05:44.539 --> 05:47.374
Book of Revelation bad.

05:48.710 --> 05:51.444
What do you do when you're feeling lost?

05:52.381 --> 05:54.914
I go back to fundamentals.

05:54.916 --> 05:58.218
Start from the beginning,
find what I missed.

05:58.220 --> 06:00.987
I rely on my training.

06:02.924 --> 06:04.524
Okay.

06:04.526 --> 06:06.493
Let's do that, then.

06:10.298 --> 06:12.565
There are things going on

06:12.567 --> 06:14.901
with the test subjects that
we've never seen before.

06:14.903 --> 06:17.142
The evidence suggests
telepathic connection,

06:17.145 --> 06:19.172
not just with each other but with us.

06:19.174 --> 06:20.673
And it's strategic.

06:20.675 --> 06:23.075
They've aggressively targeted people.

06:23.077 --> 06:25.477
Hmm. You sound spooked.

06:25.479 --> 06:28.952
You dismiss me at your
peril, Director Guilder.

06:28.955 --> 06:31.193
In my opinion, the only option is

06:31.196 --> 06:34.219
to end the experiment and
terminate the subjects on 4B.

06:34.221 --> 06:35.721
The girl, too?

06:35.723 --> 06:38.057
No. No, of course not.

06:38.059 --> 06:39.592
Amy's an exception.

06:39.594 --> 06:41.393
She's doing well.

06:41.395 --> 06:43.161
The girl was my idea, sir.

06:43.164 --> 06:46.606
She's still within the
critical post-injection window,

06:46.609 --> 06:48.168
but we're very optimistic.

06:48.171 --> 06:51.252
However, we cannot begin
to formulate a vaccine

06:51.255 --> 06:54.206
until we're sure she won't
suffer any side effects.

06:54.208 --> 06:56.692
Dr. Sykes, it's the
side effects I'm after.

06:56.695 --> 06:58.530
Did you know that I
recently changed departments?

06:58.532 --> 06:59.812
I'm now the deputy director

06:59.815 --> 07:01.713
of the Department of Special Weapons.

07:03.150 --> 07:06.075
What does the Department of
Special Weapons have to do

07:06.078 --> 07:08.520
with finding a cure for the avian flu?

07:08.522 --> 07:11.990
We have nine other facilities
working on the bird flu.

07:11.992 --> 07:15.060
I'm here to take Project
Noah into a new direction.

07:15.063 --> 07:18.697
Your work has unlocked
a potential in an area

07:18.699 --> 07:20.699
we've been trying to crack for decades.

07:20.701 --> 07:22.667
If this girl can read minds...

07:22.670 --> 07:25.937
Amy hasn't shown any
telepathic abilities.

07:25.940 --> 07:27.772
Are you sure? Have you tested her?

07:27.774 --> 07:30.856
I would never have
given a child the virus

07:30.859 --> 07:32.578
so she could be deployed as a weapon.

07:32.580 --> 07:36.349
Scientific discoveries are
made all the time by accident.

07:36.352 --> 07:38.617
Viagra was developed
as a heart medication.

07:38.619 --> 07:40.852
What a breathtakingly
inappropriate analogy.

07:40.854 --> 07:42.614
I signed on to Project Noah

07:42.617 --> 07:45.151
because of the promise
of eradicating diseases,

07:45.154 --> 07:46.571
making the world a better place.

07:46.574 --> 07:49.094
But now you want to take
that work, which, by the way,

07:49.096 --> 07:51.162
was a colossal failure,
and weaponize it?

07:52.432 --> 07:55.500
No one here wants any part of that.

07:55.502 --> 07:58.803
It's the biting everyone
is worried about.

07:58.805 --> 08:00.571
But I have a theory.

08:00.573 --> 08:04.028
With deep brain stimulation,
we may be able to control them.

08:04.031 --> 08:06.444
You can't be serious.
It's a complex procedure,

08:06.446 --> 08:08.712
but it could yield the
results that you want.

08:08.714 --> 08:11.516
Director Guilder, please ignore him.

08:11.518 --> 08:13.151
Shut us down.

08:14.387 --> 08:16.154
Dr. Pet...

08:16.156 --> 08:18.922
I'm granting you 24
hours to prove her wrong.

08:21.894 --> 08:23.628
Okay.

08:23.630 --> 08:25.663
The kitchen's gonna be empty soon.

08:25.665 --> 08:27.598
To get to the open door...
Down the hall,

08:27.600 --> 08:30.134
door's on the right... You
said it a hundred times.

08:31.237 --> 08:33.504
I literally haven't said it once.

08:38.044 --> 08:40.044
Amy...

08:40.046 --> 08:42.345
are you reading my mind?

08:45.617 --> 08:47.184
Thank you.

08:49.087 --> 08:51.388
What am I thinking right now?

08:53.358 --> 08:55.124
Amy.

08:59.665 --> 09:01.264
Baseball.

09:01.266 --> 09:03.700
26. Blue.

09:04.936 --> 09:07.170
When did this start?

09:07.172 --> 09:08.838
It just happens sometimes.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.807
I try to stop it, but it's like my brain

09:10.809 --> 09:12.709
won't listen to me.
Yeah.

09:12.711 --> 09:14.577
Please don't be mad.

09:14.579 --> 09:15.878
I'm not mad. I'm not mad.

09:15.880 --> 09:18.414
I'm-I'm just...

09:18.416 --> 09:20.216
Why didn't you tell me?

09:20.218 --> 09:22.098
I...
Wolgast.

09:22.101 --> 09:23.385
Time to go.

09:23.387 --> 09:24.921
What? Why?

09:24.923 --> 09:27.779
Amy's got a meeting.
Is this with Guilder?

09:27.782 --> 09:29.425
No. No way.
Stop it! No!

09:29.427 --> 09:30.760
We had a deal.
Move it.

09:30.762 --> 09:32.128
Deal changed.

09:32.130 --> 09:34.063
I hate you!

09:34.065 --> 09:36.833
Eat your ice cream.

09:54.837 --> 09:56.604
The blood of Christ.

10:00.124 --> 10:01.790
The blood of Christ.

10:08.132 --> 10:10.599
Someone left the back door open, I see.

10:10.601 --> 10:12.834
I come in peace, Sister.

10:12.836 --> 10:15.203
This is my friend Lila.

10:16.503 --> 10:18.307
We need a place to stay.

10:18.309 --> 10:19.875
We're in trouble.

10:19.877 --> 10:23.245
This is a convent, not a motel, Lacey.

10:23.247 --> 10:26.681
I cannot allow whatever
storm you're caught in

10:26.683 --> 10:28.383
to interrupt things here.

10:28.385 --> 10:31.609
Lacey has told me about
all the good work you do

10:31.612 --> 10:34.684
in your community, and
we would love to help out

10:34.687 --> 10:36.558
in exchange for your hospitality.

10:38.929 --> 10:41.263
You can stay for one night.

10:47.838 --> 10:50.571
The leaves will turn soon.

10:55.245 --> 10:57.444
It didn't work.

10:58.915 --> 11:01.916
None of this brought you back to me.

11:05.621 --> 11:07.688
I'm so sorry.

11:17.766 --> 11:20.167
Clark.

11:22.004 --> 11:24.939
Did you send Amy to
talk to Guilder alone

11:24.941 --> 11:26.907
without talking to me?

11:26.909 --> 11:28.942
He's my boss.

11:28.944 --> 11:31.311
Do you know what his agenda is?

11:31.313 --> 11:33.447
I follow orders.

11:33.449 --> 11:35.515
Just like I did when
you asked me to find

11:35.517 --> 11:37.083
a kid for you to experiment on.

11:37.085 --> 11:39.315
Guilder's interested in Amy

11:39.318 --> 11:40.454
for all the wrong reasons.

11:40.456 --> 11:42.689
He could take that child
and make her into a weapon.

11:42.691 --> 11:44.224
And what do you think
the military wanted

11:44.226 --> 11:46.159
out of this experiment anyway?

11:48.997 --> 11:51.030
I called the DoD.

11:51.032 --> 11:53.933
They didn't cancel Babcock's execution.

11:53.935 --> 11:55.836
You're checking up on me now?

11:56.938 --> 11:58.672
Clark.

11:58.674 --> 12:01.608
It's just you and me here.

12:01.610 --> 12:04.042
And I'm asking as someone
who cares about you,

12:04.044 --> 12:06.078
is Shauna Babcock in your head?

12:06.080 --> 12:07.813
I remember how she was.

12:07.815 --> 12:09.948
She-she has a way of drawing people in,

12:09.950 --> 12:12.885
and if-if that's what's
happened to you, I'll help you.

12:12.887 --> 12:15.020
We can deal with this together.

12:19.694 --> 12:22.227
I don't know what you're talking about.

12:30.804 --> 12:35.072
Uh, sure hope this doesn't
go south for you, Dr. Lear.

12:35.075 --> 12:37.276
Yeah.

12:37.278 --> 12:40.712
We'll check back in
during rounds, but, uh,

12:40.714 --> 12:43.615
just don't... don't look at him.

12:43.617 --> 12:45.617
Fanning, I mean.

12:45.619 --> 12:48.887
Just, um... don't.

13:00.767 --> 13:04.335
Graduation is the formality.

13:04.337 --> 13:06.270
Your hard work and dedication

13:06.272 --> 13:11.696
is what earns you the right
to call yourselves doctors.

13:11.699 --> 13:13.298
Hear, hear.

13:13.301 --> 13:15.111
When you go forth into
the world, you will...

13:15.113 --> 13:16.846
When he started talking,
it was yesterday.

13:16.849 --> 13:19.149
Shh. I'm trying to be supportive.

13:19.151 --> 13:21.414
Okay. Can we at least agree

13:21.417 --> 13:24.287
that it's gone on kind of
long and it's a little boring?

13:24.289 --> 13:27.290
Yes. I'll give you that much.
Thank you.

13:28.427 --> 13:29.560
Oh.

13:29.562 --> 13:30.994
This will help.

13:30.996 --> 13:32.863
Thank you.

13:32.865 --> 13:34.832
Hey, you're not drinking.

13:34.834 --> 13:37.468
Nope. I'm sober. Three months.

13:37.470 --> 13:39.002
Wow.

13:40.005 --> 13:41.805
Hey, that's great.

13:41.807 --> 13:43.173
How's it going?

13:43.175 --> 13:44.307
It's horrible.

13:44.309 --> 13:46.241
Mm.
I hate it.

13:48.279 --> 13:51.413
Hey, is he really
leaving for Europe? Again?

13:52.316 --> 13:53.516
Tomorrow.

13:53.518 --> 13:54.784
He's not getting back until

13:54.786 --> 13:56.452
close to the holidays this time.

13:58.957 --> 14:00.623
How you holding up?

14:00.625 --> 14:02.676
...what the job demands of them.

14:02.679 --> 14:04.812
Marriages have their ups and downs.

14:05.964 --> 14:08.097
Tonight...

14:08.099 --> 14:10.900
What if he never stops talking?

14:10.902 --> 14:12.635
We'll have to get jobs here.

14:14.171 --> 14:15.480
You ever waited tables?

14:15.483 --> 14:20.474
So that reminds me of the summer
I got a job picking apples.

14:20.477 --> 14:23.111
Oh, no. Not the apple story.

14:23.113 --> 14:25.480
Come on. Let me get you out of here.

14:25.482 --> 14:26.848
Let's go.
No. I can't. I can't.

14:26.850 --> 14:28.049
It would be rude.

14:28.051 --> 14:29.450
That's not rude.

14:29.452 --> 14:30.986
Rude is not spending his last night

14:30.988 --> 14:33.488
in the States alone
with you. That is rude.

14:33.490 --> 14:35.957
Watch this. Hey, Jonas. Shh, shh.

14:35.959 --> 14:37.993
Excuse me. I'm gonna
take your wife home.

14:37.995 --> 14:39.475
Okay.

14:41.131 --> 14:43.423
Thank you, Tim. Thanks
for leaving your Visa.

14:51.575 --> 14:53.441
The doctors tell me what a strong,

14:53.443 --> 14:55.042
healthy girl you are, Amy.

14:55.044 --> 14:57.344
You pass all their
tests with straight As.

14:57.346 --> 14:59.780
They don't put letter
grades on a medical test.

15:01.951 --> 15:03.651
Sorry I'm late.

15:03.653 --> 15:05.419
I didn't realize you were coming.

15:05.421 --> 15:07.555
I wouldn't miss it.

15:09.091 --> 15:11.391
Please. Go ahead.

15:11.393 --> 15:13.727
Thanks.

15:13.729 --> 15:17.031
Well, how do you like it
here at Project Noah, Amy?

15:17.033 --> 15:19.800
Make any friends?

15:19.802 --> 15:21.969
Who do you talk to?

15:21.971 --> 15:25.305
The agent. Dr. Sykes.

15:25.307 --> 15:27.407
And now I'm talking to you.

15:27.409 --> 15:29.542
What about Anthony Carter?

15:29.544 --> 15:32.311
Dr. Pet tells me you were friends.

15:32.313 --> 15:34.280
Maybe you still talk to him now.

15:34.282 --> 15:36.415
That's impossible. Carter's gone.

15:36.417 --> 15:39.018
Well...

15:39.020 --> 15:40.520
this seems like the kind of place

15:40.523 --> 15:42.288
where impossible things happen.

15:43.224 --> 15:44.590
You're a bad guy.

15:44.593 --> 15:47.126
What makes you say that?

15:50.097 --> 15:51.930
Amy?

15:51.932 --> 15:54.833
Did-did you just read my mind?

15:54.835 --> 15:57.469
Can you do that?

15:57.471 --> 16:01.139
Because if you can...
I can't.

16:01.141 --> 16:02.708
Well, if you could,

16:02.710 --> 16:06.411
that'd make you an
awfully special person.

16:06.413 --> 16:09.848
And isn't that what every
kid wants to be? Special?

16:09.850 --> 16:10.949
Enough.

16:12.753 --> 16:14.519
This meeting's over.

16:14.521 --> 16:16.287
It's over when I say it's over.

16:16.289 --> 16:19.256
No, Director. I'm still in charge.

16:19.258 --> 16:20.980
Now, if you want to
strip me of my clearance

16:20.983 --> 16:22.860
and relieve me of duty, go ahead,

16:22.862 --> 16:24.713
but right now you're
upsetting my patient.

16:24.716 --> 16:26.764
So we're done.

16:30.103 --> 16:33.766
Can I make a confession?
I don't like that guy.

16:33.769 --> 16:35.773
I don't trust him at all.

16:35.775 --> 16:38.542
You and me both. What are you doing?

16:38.544 --> 16:40.645
I'm taking that little
chip in your neck offline

16:40.647 --> 16:42.412
so no one can find you.

16:42.414 --> 16:44.348
How would you feel about
you and Agent Wolgast

16:44.350 --> 16:46.250
busting out of here?

16:46.252 --> 16:49.986
Not gonna lie, we were
already working on that plan.

16:49.988 --> 16:51.855
Good.

16:51.857 --> 16:53.823
I want to help.

17:08.741 --> 17:11.309
What is this?

17:11.311 --> 17:12.845
Where am I?

17:12.847 --> 17:15.146
Montrose, Texas is one answer.

17:16.750 --> 17:18.583
Have a seat.

17:23.089 --> 17:26.791
Anthony, does your friend
want something to drink?

17:27.895 --> 17:29.995
Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

17:30.932 --> 17:33.498
Thank you.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.434
He didn't kill that lady.

17:35.436 --> 17:38.095
They locked him up for
something he didn't do.

17:38.098 --> 17:39.904
It's all right, it's all right, Gran.

17:39.907 --> 17:40.972
It's all right.

17:45.111 --> 17:47.145
Love you.

17:48.649 --> 17:51.249
She's been dead for three years.

17:52.686 --> 17:55.220
One of the benefits, I guess.

17:55.222 --> 17:57.322
I can come here any time I want.

17:57.324 --> 18:00.992
Watch the road, have some tea.

18:02.192 --> 18:04.579
I didn't know how bad Project Noah was.

18:04.582 --> 18:05.849
I didn't know about Fanning.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.849
Fanning's not your only problem.

18:09.336 --> 18:12.237
Guilder wants to turn Amy into a weapon.

18:12.239 --> 18:14.506
They think they can control what we are.

18:14.508 --> 18:17.140
We'll see how that goes.

18:17.142 --> 18:19.677
I'll get her out. I'll save her.

18:19.679 --> 18:21.879
There's no saving her.

18:21.881 --> 18:25.282
Your chance to save her was
back at that foster home.

18:26.252 --> 18:29.152
See, the game has changed, bro.

18:29.154 --> 18:32.322
Nothing's going down the
way you think it will.

18:32.324 --> 18:34.425
It's Amy that's the savior.

18:34.427 --> 18:36.093
And why should I trust you?

18:36.095 --> 18:38.462
I'm here for Amy.

18:40.165 --> 18:43.501
Not for Fanning, and
certainly not for you.

18:43.503 --> 18:46.282
You don't think I've forgotten, Agent.

18:46.285 --> 18:48.819
You were my ride into this hell.

18:50.142 --> 18:51.542
I'm gonna get her out.

18:51.544 --> 18:53.811
We're gonna run away as far as we can.

18:59.384 --> 19:01.984
How you gonna outrun
the end of the world?

19:01.986 --> 19:05.354
Keeping her away from
Guilder, that's the easy part.

19:05.356 --> 19:09.225
The hard part is getting
her ready for what's coming.

19:09.227 --> 19:11.661
That's your job now, Agent.

19:17.569 --> 19:20.703
Maybe a female subject
would be more manageable.

19:20.705 --> 19:23.205
That has not been my
life experience, Emily.

19:23.207 --> 19:25.207
Winston here had a
connection with Paulson,

19:25.209 --> 19:27.243
so we know he's game.

19:31.515 --> 19:33.715
Yeah, he'll do.

19:40.524 --> 19:42.710
You couldn't spring for the valet, huh?

19:42.713 --> 19:44.593
Oh, come on. It's just up here.

19:44.595 --> 19:46.929
Good. My feet are killing me.

19:46.931 --> 19:48.797
These shoes are no joke.

19:48.799 --> 19:50.398
I did something a little impulsive,

19:50.400 --> 19:51.800
and I want your opinion.

19:51.802 --> 19:54.870
Gonna actually need your approval.

19:57.975 --> 19:59.942
You bought a car.

19:59.944 --> 20:01.176
No.

20:01.178 --> 20:03.731
I bought a 1969, fully restored...

20:03.734 --> 20:07.314
You bought a red car
with a black stripe.

20:07.317 --> 20:09.717
I did.

20:11.521 --> 20:13.221
What are you doing?

20:14.591 --> 20:17.459
I just... Sometimes I
have a hard time accepting

20:17.461 --> 20:19.627
that you're actually a scientist.

20:19.629 --> 20:23.164
I'm not just a scientist.
Technically, I'm a genius, so...

20:23.166 --> 20:25.467
You're so braggy,

20:25.469 --> 20:27.868
with all your 30-year-old girlfriends

20:27.871 --> 20:30.505
and this stupid car.

20:33.043 --> 20:35.977
You're just hilarious to me.

20:35.979 --> 20:39.981
You do understand I'm
truly in love with you?

20:39.983 --> 20:42.682
And I've never been in
love with anyone else

20:42.684 --> 20:45.352
in my entire life.

20:46.955 --> 20:50.224
Tim...

20:50.226 --> 20:53.293
Damn it.

20:53.295 --> 20:56.030
That was our subtext, and...

20:57.699 --> 21:00.100
Now it's... it's text.

21:01.470 --> 21:03.470
I don't care.

21:25.026 --> 21:26.659
Hey.

21:28.829 --> 21:31.997
You don't play Rumours for me anymore.

21:31.999 --> 21:34.133
What gives?

21:37.972 --> 21:40.706
You should have told
me that you liked it.

21:42.610 --> 21:44.142
I begged for you to kill me.

21:44.144 --> 21:46.211
Instead, you put me in a prison.

21:46.213 --> 21:49.381
So I haven't felt much
like talking to you.

21:49.383 --> 21:50.916
Is that it?

21:52.286 --> 21:54.920
Or did you just figure out how to do it?

21:57.357 --> 21:59.658
It's pretty fun.

22:00.594 --> 22:04.395
I didn't kill you because...

22:04.398 --> 22:06.966
I thought that I could save you.

22:06.968 --> 22:10.769
Well, I'm not the one who
needs saving now, am I?

22:10.771 --> 22:14.640
And I can't believe you
let Elizabeth get that bad.

22:14.642 --> 22:17.542
I didn't let her. You know
she has a progressive disease.

22:17.544 --> 22:19.677
Can you even imagine
what it's like for her?

22:19.679 --> 22:21.926
It's probably the loneliest
place in the world.

22:21.929 --> 22:23.196
Have you thought about that?

22:23.199 --> 22:25.116
I think about that every single day.

22:25.118 --> 22:26.985
And yet you could bring her back.

22:26.987 --> 22:29.587
By giving her the virus?

22:30.890 --> 22:33.124
So she could be like
you? I'd never do that.

22:33.126 --> 22:35.259
You know, maybe we should
ask her what she wants.

22:35.261 --> 22:38.663
Oh, yeah, that's right. You
can't communicate with her.

22:38.665 --> 22:40.632
I bet I could.

22:40.634 --> 22:42.767
You stay away from Elizabeth.

22:42.769 --> 22:46.303
Did she ever tell you about that
time I drove her home at night?

22:46.305 --> 22:49.140
You were all wrapped
up with your students,

22:49.142 --> 22:51.009
and she was all alone.

22:51.011 --> 22:52.976
Again.

22:52.978 --> 22:55.112
I'm not doing this.

22:56.982 --> 22:59.116
Carter gave me the message.

22:59.118 --> 23:01.519
Said we'd already changed the world.

23:01.521 --> 23:03.954
What did you mean by that?

23:03.956 --> 23:06.157
You'll see.

23:24.109 --> 23:25.608
What are you doing?

23:25.610 --> 23:27.777
Taking you to Amy.

23:31.349 --> 23:32.982
There's a shift change in an hour.

23:32.984 --> 23:35.057
I can bring you a key
card to the loading dock,

23:35.060 --> 23:36.286
but there are cameras.

23:36.288 --> 23:37.420
That shouldn't be a problem.

23:37.422 --> 23:39.522
Dr. Stuart Ross is at Stanford.

23:39.524 --> 23:41.224
He heads up infectious diseases.

23:41.226 --> 23:42.592
He's someone I trust.

23:42.594 --> 23:44.460
I'll bring her to him. I promise.

23:51.236 --> 23:53.869
I was scared you weren't gonna make it.

23:53.871 --> 23:56.005
And miss escape night?

23:56.007 --> 23:57.507
Never.

24:04.281 --> 24:07.282
Guilder was right about one thing.

24:07.284 --> 24:09.585
You're a very special little girl.

24:09.587 --> 24:11.787
I knew that the minute I met you.

24:13.257 --> 24:16.058
There's a light in you, Amy.

24:16.060 --> 24:17.893
Never forget that.

24:20.497 --> 24:22.364
Goodbye, brave girl.

24:24.235 --> 24:26.836
All right, let me just
make sure this is good.

24:28.405 --> 24:30.372
How's it hanging, Winston?

24:30.374 --> 24:32.007
He's out.

24:32.009 --> 24:34.209
Hasn't moved a muscle.
And he won't

24:34.211 --> 24:36.544
unless I tell him to.

24:44.855 --> 24:46.154
Okay.

24:47.423 --> 24:49.991
Now is the time to induce
telepathic connection.

24:50.894 --> 24:52.894
Brain waves syncing.

24:52.896 --> 24:55.663
What's the worst that
could happen in 30 seconds?

25:03.306 --> 25:05.673
How do, fella?

25:09.190 --> 25:11.011
David Winston?
Oh.

25:11.013 --> 25:15.082
Come on, now. My friends call me Dave.

25:15.084 --> 25:18.585
You seem awfully young to be a doctor.

25:22.424 --> 25:24.024
Releasing the restraints.

25:32.201 --> 25:34.067
Oh.

25:36.571 --> 25:38.705
You know...

25:38.707 --> 25:41.440
I never got sick in the old life.

25:41.442 --> 25:43.475
See, you eat well, you live well,

25:43.477 --> 25:45.477
pray hard,

25:45.479 --> 25:47.146
all works out in the end.

25:48.783 --> 25:52.484
No, sir. My vessel was clean.

25:53.754 --> 25:56.022
How about you, Doc? Is your, uh...

25:57.292 --> 25:59.658
Is your vessel clean?

26:03.698 --> 26:05.664
Stand up, Winston.

26:05.666 --> 26:08.334
Oh, don't mind if I do.

26:13.708 --> 26:15.673
Ah.

26:19.913 --> 26:21.980
Raise your right hand.

26:25.719 --> 26:28.186
Put it down.

26:29.122 --> 26:31.056
Raise your left hand.

26:31.058 --> 26:34.025
I never had an exam like this.

26:36.330 --> 26:38.029
Winston...

26:39.432 --> 26:42.033
...what am I thinking right now?

26:42.035 --> 26:47.038
The cingulate gyrus is the key
connection to the precuneus.

26:47.040 --> 26:50.274
Precuneus? Mmm.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.977
What kind of dirty word is that?

26:56.515 --> 26:58.482
Winston, sit down.

27:11.663 --> 27:13.730
You did it.

27:13.732 --> 27:16.901
I'm a freaking genius.

27:24.729 --> 27:26.581
Ooh.

27:26.584 --> 27:28.675
Here, put your jacket
on. Aren't you cold?

27:28.678 --> 27:30.632
No.

27:35.338 --> 27:37.572
I don't have a fever.

27:37.574 --> 27:40.141
It's just another weird thing I can do.

27:40.143 --> 27:41.876
I can run fast, read minds,

27:41.878 --> 27:45.113
and I can stay in a
refrigerator without a coat.

27:50.286 --> 27:52.821
I want you to know that
you can tell me anything.

27:52.823 --> 27:55.790
All right? I mean, you don't
have to handle this on your own.

27:55.792 --> 27:58.526
Secrets can make you lonely.

28:01.231 --> 28:03.598
Did something happen?

28:06.369 --> 28:08.802
I saw Shauna Babcock.

28:10.306 --> 28:12.473
It was scary.

28:15.111 --> 28:17.229
She says I'm part of their family.

28:17.232 --> 28:18.546
No. Amy...

28:18.548 --> 28:21.458
She says when I change,
you won't want me anymore.

28:21.461 --> 28:24.285
Hey, no. I'm not going anywhere.

28:24.287 --> 28:26.254
Okay, you want family, that's me.

28:26.256 --> 28:29.290
Not them. Me.

28:30.260 --> 28:32.460
Why are you so nice to me?

28:34.130 --> 28:37.664
I lost someone very precious once.

28:37.666 --> 28:39.799
And I got rid of everyone
who cared about me,

28:39.801 --> 28:41.968
because I thought it would
make it easier, you know.

28:41.970 --> 28:45.338
And then I realized that
I didn't have anyone,

28:45.340 --> 28:50.243
and I started doing things
that I shouldn't have.

28:51.180 --> 28:53.346
Then what happened?

28:53.348 --> 28:55.482
I met you.

28:56.618 --> 28:59.286
And I believe in you.

28:59.288 --> 29:02.222
And then I started to believe in myself.

29:05.760 --> 29:08.461
I'm hearing a lot of thoughts.

29:08.463 --> 29:11.797
Not just yours...

29:11.799 --> 29:14.533
but them.

29:14.535 --> 29:16.768
What are they saying?

29:16.770 --> 29:19.938
Bad stuff.

29:21.542 --> 29:23.775
What if you started
telling a story of your own?

29:23.777 --> 29:27.279
You know? That way, you wouldn't
have to listen to theirs.

29:27.281 --> 29:28.747
I don't have any stories.

29:28.749 --> 29:32.351
Oh, come on. Everyone's got stories.

29:33.554 --> 29:35.787
Best day ever. Go.

29:37.558 --> 29:38.957
I had a bike once.

29:38.959 --> 29:40.158
There you go.

29:40.160 --> 29:41.560
Yeah? What kind of bike was it?

29:41.562 --> 29:43.461
Was it, like, a... like, a BMX bike

29:43.463 --> 29:45.697
or a mountain bike, road bike?

29:45.699 --> 29:47.232
Mountain.
Mm.

29:48.801 --> 29:51.936
From up close, he looks
as harmless as a...

29:51.938 --> 29:54.905
serial killer.

29:54.907 --> 29:56.574
This gonna work?

29:57.644 --> 30:00.245
Prepare to have your mind blown.

30:00.247 --> 30:02.580
Time for the telepathic connection.

30:14.193 --> 30:16.728
It's on. Full power.

30:19.131 --> 30:20.297
Excuse me.

30:26.438 --> 30:30.150
Director Guilder, I
assure you it worked.

30:30.153 --> 30:32.142
Emily was there.

30:32.144 --> 30:34.311
Tell him you saw it.
I saw it.

30:35.314 --> 30:36.780
Real impressive.

30:36.782 --> 30:39.416
Let me know when you
have something, Pet.

31:05.209 --> 31:07.276
Hello.

31:08.546 --> 31:10.446
Do you remember me?

31:11.782 --> 31:14.516
I'm sorry, no.

31:14.519 --> 31:17.920
I'm not even sure who I am.

31:17.922 --> 31:21.324
I left the house...

31:21.326 --> 31:23.158
a long time ago.

31:23.160 --> 31:26.894
And now I'm... just lost.

31:26.896 --> 31:29.397
You're not lost.

31:31.368 --> 31:34.602
I keep feeling like there's
something I'm forgetting.

31:37.574 --> 31:40.742
I'll help you.

31:40.744 --> 31:43.144
I'll stay with you. How about that?

31:47.384 --> 31:50.218
It's so cold.

31:50.220 --> 31:54.556
I should have brought my sweater.

31:54.558 --> 31:56.123
Well, the weather changed.

31:56.125 --> 31:58.426
How were you supposed to know that?

31:58.428 --> 32:01.595
Maybe I can help.

32:10.139 --> 32:13.574
Wow. How did you do that?

32:15.278 --> 32:17.378
I'll show you sometime.

32:18.581 --> 32:21.282
Your name is Elizabeth,

32:21.284 --> 32:24.654
and you are a wonderfully
talented writer,

32:24.657 --> 32:30.557
and you are a smart,
beautiful, hilarious woman.

32:30.559 --> 32:33.559
And you are so loved.

32:36.464 --> 32:38.899
I don't remember any of that.

32:38.901 --> 32:40.767
It's okay.

32:45.207 --> 32:47.673
Do we know each other?

32:47.675 --> 32:49.675
Yes.

32:49.677 --> 32:51.811
We were friends once.

32:52.948 --> 32:54.381
I'm Tim.

32:56.084 --> 32:58.785
And I'm gonna get you out of here.

33:17.993 --> 33:19.762
Someone is gonna have to explain to me

33:19.765 --> 33:22.522
how Agent Wolgast and
the girl are both missing.

33:24.940 --> 33:28.342
Lock the place down, find them.

33:29.978 --> 33:32.178
I have some news.

33:34.449 --> 33:36.783
I'm pregnant.

33:36.785 --> 33:38.717
What do you want to do?

33:38.720 --> 33:41.154
I'm kidding.

33:41.156 --> 33:44.824
Obviously... I mean,
we haven't even had sex.

33:44.826 --> 33:46.960
I don't have time for this.

33:48.696 --> 33:53.099
Nichole is really making you
look bad here, Clark Richards.

33:53.101 --> 33:55.368
Don't even say her name.

33:55.370 --> 33:58.171
I know where she took Amy and the agent.

33:58.173 --> 34:00.706
Why should I believe you?

34:00.708 --> 34:04.844
Because we're getting out of
here real soon, Clark Richards.

34:05.747 --> 34:07.947
And when we do...

34:07.949 --> 34:10.483
I'm taking you with me.

34:12.652 --> 34:15.053
She hid 'em in the blood cooler.

34:23.030 --> 34:25.163
Let's go.

34:28.369 --> 34:30.436
You ever wonder where
they get this stuff from?

34:30.438 --> 34:32.070
Rabbits, I heard.

34:32.072 --> 34:34.072
That's a lot of dead bunnies.

34:34.074 --> 34:37.242
You good?

34:37.244 --> 34:40.103
It's you I'm worried about.
Your heart's pounding.

34:40.106 --> 34:42.773
That's not good at your age.
How old do you think I am?

34:42.775 --> 34:44.315
Don't answer that.

34:44.318 --> 34:46.385
Hey! What are you doing here?

34:46.387 --> 34:48.286
People are looking for you.

34:51.991 --> 34:53.958
Come on.

34:53.960 --> 34:56.127
Can't wait for Sykes. Let's go.

35:02.569 --> 35:04.312
Back when I lived here,

35:04.315 --> 35:07.738
Sister Arnette used to
call it "a stirring."

35:07.741 --> 35:11.443
That feeling that you were
called to a higher purpose.

35:12.979 --> 35:15.112
Truth be told, I thought it was BS.

35:15.114 --> 35:16.747
It's part of why I left.

35:16.749 --> 35:21.618
But tonight, I realized
it's happening to me now.

35:22.688 --> 35:24.288
Amy is my calling.

35:26.492 --> 35:28.625
My job is to protect that child

35:28.627 --> 35:32.896
and all the promise she
holds out to the world.

35:32.898 --> 35:37.001
How I'll proceed is
anyone's guess, but...

35:37.003 --> 35:40.771
I'll be damned. I'm
finally feeling a stirring.

35:48.914 --> 35:52.583
Please don't let
anything happen to Brad.

35:52.585 --> 35:56.119
Please don't let anything happen to Amy.

36:15.741 --> 36:18.141
You want to tell me what's going on?

36:18.143 --> 36:20.176
I don't know.

36:20.178 --> 36:23.947
I want you upstairs until
we find Brad and Amy.

36:25.985 --> 36:28.651
I hope you never find them.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.429
All right, Winston.

36:40.431 --> 36:42.732
You and me.

36:44.936 --> 36:47.670
Hey, brother.

36:48.973 --> 36:51.306
I haven't even started stimulation.

36:51.308 --> 36:53.910
You want to play that
guessing game again?

36:53.912 --> 36:55.594
Come on.

36:55.597 --> 36:59.015
Ask me to read your thoughts.
No.

36:59.017 --> 37:03.752
You're really regretting coming
down here all alone, ain't you?

37:06.289 --> 37:08.489
You weren't like this before.

37:08.491 --> 37:11.927
Well, you can tell a lot about a person

37:11.929 --> 37:15.964
when you let 'em think they're
more powerful than you are.

37:15.966 --> 37:18.099
That's what I did with the whores,

37:18.101 --> 37:21.102
and that worked every time.

37:23.440 --> 37:25.373
Okay, what-what just happened?

37:25.375 --> 37:28.577
Those were killing me. Thank you.

37:36.318 --> 37:37.751
Who turned off the lights?

37:38.654 --> 37:40.688
You did, Doc.

37:47.496 --> 37:49.730
Who opened the door?

37:49.732 --> 37:52.967
You did, Dr. Pet.

37:58.641 --> 38:03.777
Now, I suggest you run.

38:21.730 --> 38:23.029
Jonas!

38:23.031 --> 38:25.364
Jonas, help.

38:25.366 --> 38:27.634
Help me.

38:27.636 --> 38:30.003
What?
Please help me. Help me.

38:30.005 --> 38:31.237
Geez.

38:49.390 --> 38:53.259
Help! Help! Somebody help!

39:06.510 --> 39:08.377
Is that for us?
Maybe.

39:08.379 --> 39:11.413
What are we gonna do?
Move faster.

39:12.649 --> 39:15.250
My book. I left it behind.

39:15.252 --> 39:17.019
We can't go back. Let's go.

39:25.729 --> 39:29.231
Well, this is a curveball.

39:30.434 --> 39:32.901
Bad for you. Bad for me.

39:33.904 --> 39:35.469
Get out.

39:36.606 --> 39:38.439
Good news, though.

39:38.441 --> 39:40.408
You're not infected.

39:42.579 --> 39:45.880
Elizabeth told me all
about her night with you.

39:47.017 --> 39:49.651
Yeah, I already knew.

39:50.787 --> 39:52.720
She messed up.

39:54.290 --> 39:56.558
And then we fixed it.

39:58.193 --> 40:03.897
We fixed it because we love each other

40:03.900 --> 40:08.002
and our marriage is more important

40:08.004 --> 40:10.638
than some stupid mistake.

40:11.541 --> 40:13.340
And then we moved on.

40:15.645 --> 40:17.812
Clearly, you never did.

40:18.981 --> 40:20.514
And I'm beginning to think that's what

40:20.516 --> 40:22.450
all this is about.

40:25.654 --> 40:27.888
You lost,

40:27.890 --> 40:31.125
and you'll never get over it.

40:35.030 --> 40:37.331
She never loved you.

40:38.667 --> 40:41.102
She never will.

40:42.305 --> 40:44.305
You sure about that?

40:56.618 --> 41:00.319
Hey, guard! Guard, let me out of here!

41:00.322 --> 41:03.056
Let me out!

41:11.592 --> 41:12.725
Elizabeth?

41:16.527 --> 41:18.304
Elizabeth.

41:19.708 --> 41:21.541
Jonas?

41:26.187 --> 41:27.720
What? How?

41:27.723 --> 41:31.584
I-I don't know...

41:31.587 --> 41:33.487
but I'm here.

41:50.772 --> 41:52.505
No.

41:53.375 --> 41:54.641
Not through there.

41:54.643 --> 41:55.894
That's the way to the kitchen.

41:55.897 --> 41:57.053
It gets us to the drainage tunnel.

41:57.055 --> 41:58.087
Come on.

41:58.090 --> 42:00.280
I can hear him.

42:12.125 --> 42:14.159
Amy, run!

42:26.607 --> 42:28.207
Amy, go!

42:55.134 --> 42:57.300
You just did that.

42:58.204 --> 43:00.270
I just did that.

43:02.074 --> 43:04.608
We're okay. We're okay.
