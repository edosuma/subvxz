WEBVTT

04:52.876 --> 04:55.087
It is.

05:41.091 --> 05:43.010
I understand.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.346
Hey, Doc.

07:09.471 --> 07:11.181
Hey, Joe.

07:23.444 --> 07:25.654
How's it going, Doc?

07:25.779 --> 07:27.364
As good as ever.

08:11.909 --> 08:13.243
All right.

08:14.912 --> 08:16.705
You gonna need any help, Doc?

08:16.830 --> 08:19.917
Uh, heh, you know,

08:20.042 --> 08:21.293
thanks, but no, thanks.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.337
I like to work alone.

10:31.006 --> 10:32.758
<i>Camera three.</i>

12:24.119 --> 12:25.537
<i>Delivery.</i>

12:59.988 --> 13:01.448
- Hey, Tracey.
- Hey.

13:01.573 --> 13:03.074
You didn't have to bring it yourself.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.534
Aren't you supposed to be working?

13:04.659 --> 13:07.078
Oh, no, I-I got off at ten.

13:07.204 --> 13:08.538
I brought two.

13:08.663 --> 13:09.915
Can I join you?

13:13.168 --> 13:14.753
Damn.

13:14.878 --> 13:18.089
Tracey, I'm sorry,
but no one can come in here.

13:18.215 --> 13:20.133
How much do I owe ya?

13:20.258 --> 13:21.927
Oh, no, no, I‒

13:22.052 --> 13:23.470
I got 'em for free.

13:25.764 --> 13:27.682
I can't come in?

13:27.808 --> 13:29.434
That's right.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.438
Shoot.

13:34.231 --> 13:36.691
Top secret.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.151
Ooh.

13:38.276 --> 13:41.696
Now I'm so curious.
You're driving me crazy.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.368
In fact, I got to go back in.

13:46.493 --> 13:49.830
I'll stop by on my way in
tomorrow, if I can.

13:51.581 --> 13:52.916
Okay, or if I miss you,

13:53.041 --> 13:54.918
I can come back tomorrow night

13:55.043 --> 13:57.170
and bring coffees, the same time.

13:58.713 --> 14:00.590
Thanks, Tracey.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.135
You can have 'em both.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.930
Thanks, Tracey.

14:20.443 --> 14:23.029
You're a bad girl, Tracey.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.824
Try me.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.364
Beverly,

15:47.489 --> 15:49.491
tell Mrs. Houseman that we will

15:49.616 --> 15:51.493
refund two nights of her stay

15:51.618 --> 15:53.995
but not the whole week.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.748
She and her New York friends

15:56.873 --> 15:59.668
keep our spa running.

15:59.793 --> 16:01.127
Oh, good.

16:01.252 --> 16:02.837
How did the skunk get in her room?

16:02.963 --> 16:03.964
What's that?

16:04.089 --> 16:05.590
Uh, the‒the, uh, skunk,

16:05.715 --> 16:07.217
how did it get into her room?

16:07.342 --> 16:08.385
Oh, no, no, no, no.

16:08.510 --> 16:09.636
It‒it wasn't even‒

16:09.761 --> 16:11.221
even close to her room.

16:11.346 --> 16:14.265
The skunk was on the whole
other side of the hotel.

16:14.391 --> 16:16.267
- It was...
- I am here,

16:16.393 --> 16:17.769
Brother Ben!

16:23.233 --> 16:24.985
Sweet and sour,

16:25.110 --> 16:28.655
salty, crunchy...

16:28.780 --> 16:30.240
Beverly,

16:30.365 --> 16:31.783
my brother Jerry.

16:32.867 --> 16:34.995
Hi. Nice to meet you.

16:37.205 --> 16:39.582
So get back to Mrs., uh, Houseman
as we discussed...

16:39.708 --> 16:40.625
Okay.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.502
- ...and I'll get back to you later.
- Sure thing.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.926
Is that the new girl?

16:50.051 --> 16:51.553
Or should I say "woman"?

16:51.678 --> 16:54.347
A woman like that, you can't call a girl.

16:55.974 --> 16:58.727
Beverly, yes.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.061
Are you banging her yet?

17:00.186 --> 17:01.938
Oh, Jerry!

17:02.063 --> 17:05.150
R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

17:05.275 --> 17:06.860
Respect.

17:08.653 --> 17:11.281
She's a beautiful soul.

17:11.406 --> 17:12.699
And she's married.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.910
That never stopped you before.

17:16.036 --> 17:18.621
Sock it to me. Sock it to me.
Sock it to me. Sock it to me.

17:18.747 --> 17:21.166
Jerry.

17:21.291 --> 17:23.710
What else do you have on your mind?

17:23.835 --> 17:27.338
Swimming in my mind
at this time, literally,

17:27.464 --> 17:31.718
is my new hydroponic indica-sativa hybrid,

17:31.843 --> 17:34.596
a touch of the mythic AK-47

17:34.721 --> 17:37.265
by way of the Amsterdam express.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.350
It's baked into this banana bread

17:39.476 --> 17:42.228
and infused in this potent spreadable jam

17:42.353 --> 17:44.773
that's ideal for creative sojourns

17:44.898 --> 17:47.025
of a solitary nature.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.318
Wheels up.

17:49.611 --> 17:51.488
Jerry,

17:51.613 --> 17:54.574
a prophet is without honor

17:54.699 --> 17:57.535
who eats his own profits.

17:57.660 --> 17:59.079
R&D, brother Ben.

17:59.204 --> 18:00.914
It puts me in a groove,

18:01.039 --> 18:02.749
and where it stops, nobody knows.

18:04.334 --> 18:07.962
Thank God you are no longer
in the hotel business.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.882
Where have you been, Ben?

18:11.007 --> 18:13.760
Yeah, my new legally sanctioned business

18:13.885 --> 18:15.595
is tripling our revenue.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.310
Is that Mother's hat?

18:33.029 --> 18:35.657
Hello. I'd like to see Sheriff Truman.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.492
Which one?

18:37.617 --> 18:39.452
Which one?

18:40.245 --> 18:42.080
Sheriff Truman isn't here?

18:42.205 --> 18:44.124
Well, do you know which one?

18:44.249 --> 18:45.500
It could make a difference.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.836
Uh, no, ma'am.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.254
One is sick,

18:49.379 --> 18:51.506
and the other one is fishing.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.258
Uh...

18:53.383 --> 18:55.677
It could make a difference.

18:57.137 --> 19:00.473
It's about insurance.

19:00.598 --> 19:04.936
I'm not sure I will be able to help you.

19:05.061 --> 19:06.688
I'd like to see Sheriff Truman.

19:12.527 --> 19:13.862
I'll leave my card

19:13.987 --> 19:16.322
and call in another day.

19:16.447 --> 19:17.574
Thank you.

19:17.699 --> 19:19.909
I'll keep the card,

19:20.034 --> 19:21.327
but unless‒

20:57.799 --> 20:59.175
Hey.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.261
Where the hell do you think you're going?

21:10.103 --> 21:12.563
Well, lookee here.

21:15.233 --> 21:16.776
Otis.

22:27.472 --> 22:29.182
Hello, Buella.

22:32.143 --> 22:33.853
How you?

22:35.521 --> 22:37.190
Buella,

22:37.315 --> 22:39.442
Ray and Darya‒

22:39.567 --> 22:41.819
have you got them
back there somewhere?

22:42.862 --> 22:44.989
I'll get 'em.

22:45.114 --> 22:47.867
And, Buella,

22:47.992 --> 22:50.495
put something better at your front door.

22:57.752 --> 23:01.089
It's a world of truck drivers.

23:08.513 --> 23:10.723
Ray!

23:10.848 --> 23:12.683
Darya!

23:31.244 --> 23:33.246
Ray,

23:33.371 --> 23:36.457
Darya,

23:36.582 --> 23:37.792
let's go.

23:57.103 --> 24:00.773
Mr. C. Mr. C.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.401
See ya, Otis.

25:52.134 --> 25:53.344
Hey, Tracey.

25:55.221 --> 25:56.847
He's not here.

25:56.973 --> 25:58.933
No one is here.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.351
Really?

26:46.147 --> 26:48.065
Weird.

26:48.190 --> 26:49.483
Where is he?

26:51.027 --> 26:53.237
Does this, by any chance,
mean that I can

26:53.362 --> 26:55.114
go in there with you?

26:55.239 --> 26:56.574
I brought us two lattes again.

27:00.161 --> 27:02.288
Well,

27:02.413 --> 27:05.291
since there's no one here to stop you,

27:05.416 --> 27:08.711
I guess you could come in
for a little while.

27:08.836 --> 27:12.298
But I don't know how you're gonna get out
if the guard comes back.

27:13.257 --> 27:16.302
Let's not overthink this opportunity.

27:34.445 --> 27:36.322
Whoa.

27:53.047 --> 27:55.341
What is that thing?

27:55.466 --> 27:57.343
A glass box.

27:59.261 --> 28:01.639
Yeah, but what's it for?

28:02.556 --> 28:04.392
I really don't know.

28:04.517 --> 28:07.561
It's just a job I got
to help with school.

28:14.568 --> 28:17.279
Whose place is this?

28:17.405 --> 28:20.324
I heard a billionaire.

28:20.449 --> 28:22.785
Some anonymous billionaire.

28:22.910 --> 28:24.829
Mysterious.

28:40.344 --> 28:42.638
I'm supposed to watch the box

28:42.763 --> 28:46.100
and see if anything appears inside.

28:46.225 --> 28:48.144
What?

28:48.269 --> 28:49.895
Do things appear?

28:50.020 --> 28:52.857
I haven't seen anything since I started.

28:52.982 --> 28:55.484
But the guy I replaced,

28:55.609 --> 28:57.486
he saw something once.

28:57.611 --> 28:58.487
What?

28:58.612 --> 29:00.448
He wouldn't tell me.

29:00.573 --> 29:02.742
Or couldn't tell me.

29:02.867 --> 29:05.494
We're not supposed to say
anything about this place

29:05.619 --> 29:07.413
or that glass box.

29:16.797 --> 29:18.466
It's a lot of equipment.

29:18.591 --> 29:20.468
Is it some sort
of science experiment

29:20.593 --> 29:22.011
or something like that?

29:22.136 --> 29:23.596
I guess you could say that.

29:24.847 --> 29:27.641
Do you want to sit down?

29:27.767 --> 29:29.310
Okay.

29:53.793 --> 29:55.294
Cozy.

29:56.796 --> 29:57.755
Here's your coffee.

29:57.880 --> 29:59.673
Thanks, Tracey.

30:54.645 --> 30:57.773
Do you want to make out a little?

30:57.898 --> 30:59.733
What do you think?

31:05.656 --> 31:06.866
Mm.

31:16.959 --> 31:18.377
Mm!

32:43.545 --> 32:45.089
Mm.

33:17.788 --> 33:19.373
Stop.

33:24.586 --> 33:25.546
What?

33:25.671 --> 33:26.839
Shh.

33:30.175 --> 33:32.594
Shh.

35:04.144 --> 35:06.438
What is it, Armstrong?

35:06.563 --> 35:08.273
Oh, oh!

35:09.024 --> 35:10.234
Ruth.

35:11.819 --> 35:13.487
Ruth, are you in there?

35:13.612 --> 35:15.322
Oh, oh, my goodness.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.658
Come on. Come on, Armstrong.

35:17.783 --> 35:19.493
Come on, Armstrong.

35:21.912 --> 35:22.788
Come on.

35:22.913 --> 35:24.164
Ugh.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.795
Oh, come on, Armstrong. Come on.

35:29.920 --> 35:31.255
Come on, little you.

35:31.380 --> 35:33.298
Yeah.

35:33.423 --> 35:34.758
By golly.

35:37.845 --> 35:39.596
Oh, yes, hello?

35:39.721 --> 35:41.431
Yeah, you don't know me.

35:41.557 --> 35:43.809
This is‒this is Marjorie Green.

35:43.934 --> 35:45.727
But my neighbor, there's something wrong.

35:45.853 --> 35:48.397
Yeah, um, I haven't
seen her in three days.

35:48.522 --> 35:50.357
Oh, and then there's that terrible smell.

35:50.482 --> 35:52.484
And Armstrong smelled it in the‒

35:52.609 --> 35:54.319
Then I smelled it‒
No.

35:54.444 --> 35:56.113
No, Armstrong's my dog.

35:56.238 --> 35:57.990
No‒
Oh, my address?

35:58.115 --> 35:59.783
Oh, I-I-I don't know.

35:59.908 --> 36:01.201
Um, oh, my goodness.

36:01.326 --> 36:02.995
Um, yes, oh, I know this.

36:03.120 --> 36:04.496
You know, I know this.

36:32.608 --> 36:33.901
It was a funny thing.

36:34.026 --> 36:35.611
I couldn't remember my address

36:35.736 --> 36:37.070
when I called you on the phone.

36:37.196 --> 36:39.239
Where's the smell coming from,
Mrs. Green?

36:43.035 --> 36:44.703
Oh.

36:44.828 --> 36:46.330
Oh‒oh...

37:01.178 --> 37:03.597
Oh, there it is again.

37:03.722 --> 37:05.265
There's that smell.

37:05.390 --> 37:06.391
Ugh.

37:19.696 --> 37:23.075
Oh...

37:23.200 --> 37:25.535
Ma'am, is there a manager
on-site with a key?

37:25.661 --> 37:27.621
Oh, I don't know.

37:27.746 --> 37:30.624
Um, Barney's usually here.

37:30.749 --> 37:32.251
Um, do you want me to go check?

37:32.376 --> 37:33.961
Yes, ma'am, if you don't mind.

37:34.086 --> 37:35.879
Oh. I just remembered.

37:36.004 --> 37:37.297
Barney's not here.

37:37.422 --> 37:39.216
He's a funny one, that Barney.

37:39.341 --> 37:40.842
He's in the hospital,

37:40.968 --> 37:43.553
not the regular hospital.

37:47.057 --> 37:48.267
Hey, uh, Darlene,

37:48.392 --> 37:49.685
we're gonna need a locksmith

37:49.810 --> 37:52.145
over at 1349 Arrowhead,

37:52.271 --> 37:53.897
possible 10-54.

37:54.022 --> 37:56.608
No, no, 1349.

37:56.733 --> 37:58.819
Ma'am, who lives in this apartment?

37:58.944 --> 38:01.822
That would be Ruth, Ruth Davenport.

38:01.947 --> 38:03.448
And I just remembered something.

38:03.573 --> 38:04.658
What's that, ma'am?

38:04.783 --> 38:06.243
When Barney's out of town,

38:06.368 --> 38:08.954
he leaves the keys with his brother.

38:09.079 --> 38:11.915
And who would that be?

38:12.040 --> 38:13.542
Oh, I don't know.

38:13.667 --> 38:15.544
Um, I've never met him.

38:15.669 --> 38:17.045
But Hank would know him.

38:17.170 --> 38:18.297
Who's Hank?

38:18.422 --> 38:20.549
Barney's friend, Hank Fillmore.

38:20.674 --> 38:23.343
Where would we find Hank?

38:23.468 --> 38:25.345
Oh, well...

38:25.470 --> 38:27.973
I don't know right now.

38:28.098 --> 38:29.599
He's our maintenance man.

38:29.725 --> 38:32.519
But I saw him out back a little while ago.

38:55.959 --> 38:57.210
Harvey?

38:57.336 --> 38:59.296
Harvey, you son of a bitch!

38:59.421 --> 39:00.839
Are you Hank?

39:05.552 --> 39:07.179
What the hell?

39:07.304 --> 39:09.139
Police, Mr. Fillmore.

39:09.264 --> 39:10.557
We need your help.

39:10.682 --> 39:12.100
Did Harvey send you?

39:12.225 --> 39:13.810
Mr. Fillmore, we need a key

39:13.935 --> 39:15.604
for Ruth Davenport's apartment.

39:15.729 --> 39:18.690
We're trying to find Barney's brother.

39:18.815 --> 39:21.777
Well, who told you
I was going to see Chip?

39:21.902 --> 39:24.237
Who's Chip?

39:25.781 --> 39:27.240
That's Barney's brother.

39:27.366 --> 39:29.910
We need a key from Chip.

39:30.035 --> 39:31.870
I was just on my way, but h‒

39:31.995 --> 39:33.080
how did you know?

39:33.205 --> 39:35.457
Well, do you have a phone number for Chip?

39:35.582 --> 39:36.792
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

39:36.917 --> 39:38.126
Chip?

39:38.251 --> 39:41.296
Chip ain't got no phone.

39:41.421 --> 39:43.215
I'll wait for the locksmith.

39:43.340 --> 39:45.675
Excuse me.

39:45.801 --> 39:48.470
Do you think that maybe
Ruth's out of town?

39:48.595 --> 39:49.721
Why?

39:49.846 --> 39:51.181
Well, it would be a shame

39:51.306 --> 39:52.641
'cause I'm supposed to water her plants

39:52.766 --> 39:54.684
when she's out of town.

39:54.810 --> 39:56.603
I have the key.

39:58.271 --> 39:59.689
Let's go.

40:01.608 --> 40:03.735
Am I‒am I free to go?

40:06.154 --> 40:08.615
Gentlemen, am‒am I free to go?

41:21.396 --> 41:23.064
Uh-oh.

41:26.568 --> 41:28.653
Harvey, you son of a bitch.

41:28.778 --> 41:31.281
Did you send the cops
to my place of business?

41:31.406 --> 41:33.450
My work?

41:33.575 --> 41:34.826
Harvey‒
Yes.

41:34.951 --> 41:36.328
Yeah, I got it‒

41:36.453 --> 41:37.704
I got all of it,

41:37.829 --> 41:39.289
right here, but it's mine.

41:39.414 --> 41:40.999
Mine and Chip's.

41:41.124 --> 41:43.418
No. You opted out of this one, remember?

41:43.543 --> 41:45.629
Harvey‒Harvey, don't‒

41:45.754 --> 41:47.506
don't threaten me, Harvey.

41:47.631 --> 41:48.840
Harvey.

41:50.258 --> 41:51.384
Harvey?

42:29.464 --> 42:30.674
Constance?

42:33.885 --> 42:35.095
Good for you, Dave.

42:35.220 --> 42:38.014
You're behaving yourself for a change.

42:38.139 --> 42:40.016
Want to help me with this?

42:41.810 --> 42:43.562
Very carefully.

42:45.272 --> 42:48.233
Keep it way up, off the body.

42:52.654 --> 42:54.239
Uh-oh.

43:47.375 --> 43:48.752
<i>Deputy Hawk,</i>

43:48.877 --> 43:51.004
<i>Margaret Lanterman's on line one.</i>

43:51.129 --> 43:54.424
<i>It's the line
with the light that's blinking.</i>

43:54.549 --> 43:56.259
Okay, Lucy, thank you.

43:57.927 --> 44:00.597
Margaret, what can I do for you?

44:00.722 --> 44:02.098
<i>Hawk.</i>

44:03.558 --> 44:06.853
My log has a message for you.

44:10.065 --> 44:12.442
Okay.

44:14.527 --> 44:17.030
Something is missing,

44:17.155 --> 44:20.408
and you have to find it.

44:20.533 --> 44:22.535
It has to do with

44:22.661 --> 44:25.205
Special Agent Dale Cooper.

44:25.330 --> 44:28.041
Dale Cooper?

44:28.166 --> 44:30.210
What is it?

44:31.211 --> 44:33.505
The way you will find it...

44:37.175 --> 44:40.387
...has something to do with your heritage.

44:44.224 --> 44:48.186
This is the message from the log.

44:50.897 --> 44:52.524
Okay, Margaret.

44:52.649 --> 44:54.025
Thank you.

44:56.611 --> 44:58.988
Good night, Hawk.

45:01.866 --> 45:04.202
Good night, Margaret.

45:49.414 --> 45:51.207
Dave?

45:51.332 --> 45:52.375
Dave!

45:52.500 --> 45:53.626
On my way.

45:57.672 --> 45:59.090
You got to see this.

45:59.215 --> 46:01.134
The head is definitely Ruth Davenport,

46:01.259 --> 46:04.137
the woman who lived in the apartment.

46:04.262 --> 46:06.347
And we've got a male John Doe.

46:08.183 --> 46:09.684
We don't know whose body that is.

46:09.809 --> 46:11.144
Nothing's come back on those prints.

46:11.269 --> 46:13.021
But there's another set of prints

46:13.146 --> 46:14.522
all over the apartment.

46:14.647 --> 46:17.859
And we've got a hit,

46:17.984 --> 46:20.653
a definite local hit.

46:22.071 --> 46:24.657
Bill Hastings?

46:24.783 --> 46:26.493
Oh, my God.

46:26.618 --> 46:27.660
Yeah.

46:27.786 --> 46:29.954
He's my kid's principal.

47:13.998 --> 47:15.166
Dave!

47:15.291 --> 47:16.876
- What are you‒
- Phyllis, is Bill home?

47:17.001 --> 47:18.628
- Yeah.
- Who is it, honey?

47:18.753 --> 47:20.380
It's Dave, Dave Macklay.

47:25.093 --> 47:26.427
Dave, hey.

47:26.553 --> 47:27.762
What's going on, buddy?

47:27.887 --> 47:29.097
Bill, uh,

47:29.222 --> 47:31.432
I'm gonna have to put you under arrest.

47:33.351 --> 47:35.228
- What?
- Please turn around.

47:35.353 --> 47:38.147
I've got to cuff you,
and I've got to take you in.

47:38.273 --> 47:39.607
Oh, my God, Bill!

47:39.732 --> 47:41.276
- No, it...
- Oh, my God.

47:41.401 --> 47:43.069
It's okay, honey. I hav‒
I haven't done anything wrong.

47:43.194 --> 47:44.779
Could, uh‒could you tell me
what this is about?

47:44.904 --> 47:46.865
We can talk about that at the station.

47:46.990 --> 47:47.907
I want to come with you.

47:48.032 --> 47:49.701
No, no, stay here.
There's been a mistake.

47:49.826 --> 47:51.953
All right?
I haven't done anything wrong.

47:52.078 --> 47:53.580
You have the right
to remain silent.

47:53.705 --> 47:55.373
Anything you say can and will be used

47:55.498 --> 47:57.959
against you in a court of law.

47:58.084 --> 47:59.961
But the Morgans are coming for dinner!

48:00.086 --> 48:01.421
Do you understand
these rights I am‒

48:01.546 --> 48:02.714
I understand perfectly.

48:02.839 --> 48:05.216
Just call George and tell him where I am!

48:40.251 --> 48:43.004
She said something is missing

48:43.129 --> 48:45.757
and it has to do with Agent Cooper.

48:49.052 --> 48:52.680
But Agent Cooper is missing.

48:52.805 --> 48:55.600
And he hasn't been seen or heard from

48:55.725 --> 48:57.352
since before Wally was born,

48:57.477 --> 48:59.771
and Wally's 24 years old.

48:59.896 --> 49:02.482
He was born on the same day
as Marlon Brando.

49:02.607 --> 49:04.525
Andy wanted to name him Marlon.

49:04.651 --> 49:07.278
And we haven't even gotten
a Christmas card from Agent Cooper.

49:07.403 --> 49:08.863
He hasn't even seen Wally.

49:08.988 --> 49:12.116
Andy, Lucy, it's late.

49:12.241 --> 49:15.495
Go down to storage
and get those files that we talked about.

49:15.620 --> 49:17.830
Tomorrow morning, lay 'em all out.

49:17.956 --> 49:20.500
I'll bring the coffee and the doughnuts.

49:20.625 --> 49:23.920
Okay, Deputy Chief Hawk.

49:41.938 --> 49:43.189
Dave?

49:45.066 --> 49:47.527
Don Harrison, State Police, Rapid City.

49:47.652 --> 49:50.154
Hmm, are you taking this case?

49:50.279 --> 49:51.239
It's yours, Dave.

49:51.364 --> 49:52.699
Just here to help.

49:52.824 --> 49:54.867
Mm.

49:54.993 --> 49:57.328
Any luck with the missing body and head?

49:59.747 --> 50:00.999
Nothing.

50:04.585 --> 50:07.005
How long's he been in there?

50:07.130 --> 50:09.007
About half an hour.

50:09.132 --> 50:11.634
That's enough.

50:11.759 --> 50:15.179
You sure you don't want to take this?

50:15.304 --> 50:19.017
Mike said you're fishing buddies.

50:19.142 --> 50:21.936
I've known him since high school.

50:22.061 --> 50:25.148
He might tell you more than he'd tell me.

50:25.273 --> 50:26.649
Go on in.

50:38.077 --> 50:39.996
<i>Oh, I'm sorry about the delay.</i>

50:40.121 --> 50:42.206
<i>Uh, did they get you some coffee?</i>

50:42.331 --> 50:45.251
<i>I'm good with the water.</i>

50:45.376 --> 50:48.296
Can you‒can you, uh,

50:48.421 --> 50:50.131
uh...

50:50.256 --> 50:53.092
can you please tell me what's going on?

50:53.217 --> 50:54.343
We'll get to that,

50:54.469 --> 50:56.137
but I have a few questions

50:56.262 --> 50:58.681
that I have to ask you first.

50:58.806 --> 51:00.516
Um...

51:03.061 --> 51:05.521
Do you know a Ruth Davenport?

51:10.401 --> 51:13.696
That name sounds familiar.

51:13.821 --> 51:15.114
Uh...

51:15.239 --> 51:17.158
the librarian?

51:17.283 --> 51:18.451
- Yes.
- Ah, okay.

51:18.576 --> 51:20.078
That's her.

51:20.203 --> 51:21.746
Do you know her?

51:23.331 --> 51:24.415
Not really.

51:24.540 --> 51:26.292
We say hello to each other.

51:26.417 --> 51:28.252
Mm.

51:28.377 --> 51:31.130
When did you see her last?

51:31.255 --> 51:32.757
Oh, I don't know.

51:32.882 --> 51:34.592
Uh, let me think.

51:36.636 --> 51:38.930
Maybe a couple months ago?

51:41.432 --> 51:42.558
Mm.

51:44.268 --> 51:46.979
Have you ever been
to Ruth Davenport's home?

51:47.105 --> 51:49.148
No. I've never been there.

51:49.273 --> 51:52.276
I don't‒I don't‒I don't
even know where she lives.

51:52.401 --> 51:54.612
Mm-hmm.

51:54.737 --> 51:57.240
Have you ever been
to the apartment building

51:57.365 --> 52:00.618
at 1349 Arrowhead Road?

52:02.036 --> 52:03.204
No.

52:03.329 --> 52:04.789
I never have.

52:04.914 --> 52:06.999
Uh,

52:07.125 --> 52:09.877
<i>I-I</i>‒<i>I've</i>‒<i>I've never</i>‒
<i>I've never been there.</i>

52:10.002 --> 52:12.088
<i>Could</i>‒<i>could you please tell me
what this is about?</i>

52:12.213 --> 52:13.214
Did you get the warrant?

52:13.339 --> 52:14.549
Any minute.

52:14.674 --> 52:16.509
Judge was up the mountain.

52:16.634 --> 52:19.345
<i>Bill,</i>

52:19.470 --> 52:21.139
<i>can you account for your time</i>

52:21.264 --> 52:23.391
<i>over the last three or four days?</i>

52:23.516 --> 52:25.017
<i>Sure, yes, I can.</i>

52:25.143 --> 52:26.644
<i>Uh, I've been at school every weekday.</i>

52:26.769 --> 52:28.104
<i>And evenings?</i>

52:28.229 --> 52:29.814
Our high-school principal.

52:29.939 --> 52:33.609
<i>Uh, Wednesday,
I went home right after school.</i>

52:33.734 --> 52:35.945
Thursday, we had

52:36.070 --> 52:38.990
a-a meeting in the evening.

52:39.115 --> 52:41.075
And then...

52:42.285 --> 52:44.162
...I went home.

52:44.287 --> 52:47.373
And then...

52:47.498 --> 52:48.916
uh, Friday, I went‒

52:49.041 --> 52:50.668
I went out to dinner, Phyllis and I.

52:50.793 --> 52:52.211
But we went home right after that.

52:52.336 --> 52:55.506
And‒and I was home all day today.

52:57.091 --> 52:58.593
What‒what‒

52:58.718 --> 53:01.512
what was this Thursday meeting about?

53:01.637 --> 53:02.555
Curriculum.

53:02.680 --> 53:04.348
F-faculty evaluation.

53:04.473 --> 53:06.017
It's a bimonthly meeting.

53:06.142 --> 53:08.186
Mm-hmm. And when did it end?

53:09.770 --> 53:11.272
Around 9:30, I believe.

53:11.397 --> 53:12.982
I don't know. We ordered pizza.

53:15.651 --> 53:17.862
And...

53:17.987 --> 53:20.948
you went home directly after?

53:21.073 --> 53:22.575
Yes.

53:22.700 --> 53:25.369
And what time did you get there?

53:25.494 --> 53:27.371
10:15, 10:20.

53:30.583 --> 53:33.753
Well, how long does it take you
to drive home usually?

53:42.094 --> 53:43.262
Um...

53:46.641 --> 53:49.435
Oh, yeah‒

53:49.560 --> 53:52.605
oh, yeah, now I remember.

53:52.730 --> 53:54.607
I gave...

53:56.025 --> 53:58.194
...my assistant, Betty, a ride home.

54:00.279 --> 54:02.907
Something wrong with her...

54:03.032 --> 54:05.618
car, something wrong...

54:14.919 --> 54:18.714
I think I'd like to speak to George.

54:18.839 --> 54:20.132
He's my lawyer.

54:20.258 --> 54:24.178
Is‒is‒is‒is he‒is he‒is he here?

54:24.303 --> 54:25.972
I can check.

54:30.851 --> 54:32.853
But, Bill, is there anything else

54:32.979 --> 54:34.981
that you would like to tell me

54:35.106 --> 54:37.733
before we get the lawyer involved?

54:47.743 --> 54:50.705
Please tell me what's going on.

54:56.627 --> 54:58.921
Ruth Davenport was murdered.

54:59.046 --> 55:02.341
And your prints are
all over her apartment.

55:12.685 --> 55:13.811
What?

55:15.354 --> 55:16.814
What?

55:21.777 --> 55:24.363
<i>Show Mr. Hastings to his new room.</i>

55:24.488 --> 55:26.949
He can meet with his lawyer there.

55:29.452 --> 55:32.496
Right, you're gonna have
to come with me now, Bill.

55:33.706 --> 55:35.207
Right out here.

55:57.480 --> 56:00.149
To the left here, Bill.

56:05.488 --> 56:07.239
Right‒right here, Bill.

56:17.458 --> 56:19.335
Dave,

56:19.460 --> 56:20.961
could I speak to Phyllis?

56:21.087 --> 56:22.880
Could you let me‒
could you let me do that?

56:24.924 --> 56:27.134
I'll see what I can do.

57:04.588 --> 57:05.714
Mrs. Hastings,

57:05.840 --> 57:07.883
we have a warrant
to search your house.

57:09.885 --> 57:12.012
This is unbelievable.

57:12.138 --> 57:13.931
We have guests for dinner tonight.

57:14.056 --> 57:16.517
Is that Bill's car
in the driveway, ma'am?

57:16.642 --> 57:18.102
It's the Volvo.

57:18.227 --> 57:20.187
We'll need the keys.

57:20.312 --> 57:21.522
Dave?

57:21.647 --> 57:23.649
It has to be done, Phyllis.

57:33.576 --> 57:34.743
We're coming in.

57:40.416 --> 57:41.417
Let's go.

58:16.327 --> 58:18.120
My flashlight's broke.

58:36.096 --> 58:37.973
Woof.
