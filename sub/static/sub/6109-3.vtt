00:18.520 --> 00:20.355
Oh, f...

00:30.657 --> 00:32.534
Hello?

00:35.453 --> 00:36.621
Pryce?

00:38.623 --> 00:40.375
Annie?

01:13.032 --> 01:15.744
You shouldn't be
walking around.

01:15.910 --> 01:18.163
I'm OK, I'm OK.

01:19.164 --> 01:21.249
Any pain or pressure?

01:21.416 --> 01:23.042
Just a little headache,
that's all.

01:23.209 --> 01:25.795
I guess I should thank you
for saving my life again.

01:25.962 --> 01:28.757
Thank God it was only
a bump on the head.

01:28.923 --> 01:30.925
Why are you thanking God?
He let it happen.

01:31.092 --> 01:32.844
And a slight bump on the head

01:33.011 --> 01:34.888
is exactly the wrong way
to think about a concussion.

01:35.054 --> 01:37.849
Avoid any physical exertion
for the next 24 hours.

01:38.016 --> 01:40.310
Sure. Why are we in here?

01:40.477 --> 01:42.228
Oh, because Annie, before
becoming a registered nurse,

01:42.395 --> 01:44.022
clearly was a Girl Scout.

01:44.189 --> 01:46.316
I believe Ã‰claireuses
Unionistes de France

01:46.483 --> 01:48.067
is the French equivalent.

01:48.234 --> 01:50.445
She was worried you'd gotten
bitten during the attack,

01:50.612 --> 01:53.031
and she knew the rule
that all Girl Scouts know,

01:53.198 --> 01:54.783
French or otherwise...

01:56.659 --> 01:58.953
..bring the doctor
the thing that bit you.

02:05.752 --> 02:08.128
Autopsy time.

04:00.533 --> 04:02.076
Oh, wow!

04:12.962 --> 04:15.089
Right there, in the Oval Office,

04:15.256 --> 04:18.384
Mr Johnson presents
his own johnson

04:18.551 --> 04:20.345
with a mighty flourish,

04:20.511 --> 04:22.764
and he tells the congressman,

04:22.931 --> 04:26.643
"This, my friend,
is why we're in Vietnam."

04:29.520 --> 04:32.106
A hundred years prior...

04:33.900 --> 04:37.779
..another US president,
one Ulysses S. Grant,

04:37.946 --> 04:40.740
never let anyone see him naked

04:40.907 --> 04:44.786
for reasons unknown
to the historical record.

04:44.953 --> 04:49.916
However, I have three
and a half theories why.

04:50.083 --> 04:54.045
Number one,
he had an infant-sized...

04:54.212 --> 04:57.256
Subject is female, Caucasian,

04:57.423 --> 05:01.386
5'8" and weighing 121 pounds.

05:02.971 --> 05:04.305
Subject is cachectic

05:04.472 --> 05:07.350
with large patches of
reticulated hyperpigmentation

05:07.517 --> 05:10.770
on her chest, abdomen,
and left anterior thigh

05:10.937 --> 05:12.772
consistent with melanoma.

05:12.939 --> 05:16.776
It's skinny and misshapen with
that blue stuff on its skin.

05:16.943 --> 05:18.778
Yeah, I got the gist.

05:18.945 --> 05:22.365
Fingers are ossified,
flexed into an immobile,

05:22.532 --> 05:24.409
claw-like configuration

05:24.575 --> 05:27.912
with thickened,
hypertrophic nails.

05:28.079 --> 05:30.873
All the better to rip your heart
out with, my dear.

05:34.335 --> 05:36.546
Admirable jaw flexibility.

05:46.347 --> 05:48.474
An accessory sinus
in the maxilla

05:48.641 --> 05:50.768
apparently filled with venom.

05:51.769 --> 05:54.897
- Sound familiar?
- You think this is one of us?

05:55.064 --> 05:57.442
Upirs don't feed on other upirs.
We can't.

05:57.608 --> 05:59.068
We'd get horribly sick.

05:59.235 --> 06:01.070
Bone saw.

07:05.927 --> 07:09.013
- Well, that's...
- Interesting.

07:10.932 --> 07:12.058
Sure.

07:12.225 --> 07:14.018
Grey-mottled,
highly vascular mass

07:14.185 --> 07:17.647
with extensions
to the right upper quadrant

07:17.814 --> 07:21.567
of the abdomen
and the base of the neck.

07:21.734 --> 07:23.611
I have never seen a tumour
this big.

07:23.778 --> 07:25.696
That's what makes it
interesting.

07:29.700 --> 07:32.954
- Jesus Christ!
- Very interesting.

07:33.121 --> 07:34.997
Is that alive?

07:36.082 --> 07:38.084
The corpse isn't, by definition.

07:38.251 --> 07:41.796
As for the tumour, highly
differentiated structures

07:41.963 --> 07:43.923
reminiscent of
a string of ganglia,

07:44.090 --> 07:46.843
suggesting higher
nervous system function.

07:48.761 --> 07:50.471
That thing's got a brain?

07:55.101 --> 07:57.937
And an appetite, apparently.

07:58.104 --> 08:00.857
The tumour's created a fistula
from the oesophagus

08:01.023 --> 08:04.819
to a large pocket near
the now unused original stomach.

08:04.986 --> 08:07.488
A cancer that thinks and eats?

08:08.823 --> 08:10.032
LoPS.

08:10.199 --> 08:11.450
Sorry?

08:11.617 --> 08:13.452
Lower peritoneal
squamous lymphoma, LoPS.

08:13.619 --> 08:15.955
It reminds me
of a tumour structure

08:16.122 --> 08:18.124
I dissected in medical school.

08:20.126 --> 08:22.128
Let's have a look
at Miss LoPS' brain.

08:29.051 --> 08:32.096
The tumour invests
in multiple brain regions...

08:33.264 --> 08:35.308
..especially the frontal lobe.

08:35.474 --> 08:37.643
Reasoning, self-control.

08:37.809 --> 08:40.520
- The optic nerve.
- Vision.

08:40.688 --> 08:43.816
- And the lateral hypothalamus.
- Hunger.

08:45.109 --> 08:46.986
Hypothesis -

08:47.153 --> 08:48.905
the LoPS appears to be
some previously unknown fusion

08:49.071 --> 08:51.574
of cancer
and a parasitical organism.

08:51.741 --> 08:55.453
By employing the rapidly
replicating cellular structure

08:55.620 --> 08:59.624
of tumours to manipulate the
nervous and digestive systems,

08:59.790 --> 09:01.500
it can be speculated
that the organism

09:01.667 --> 09:03.544
is modifying the behaviour
of the host

09:03.711 --> 09:07.048
to allow...or even compel

09:07.215 --> 09:10.760
the consumption
of the host's own species.

09:10.927 --> 09:14.555
Which means you, of course.

09:20.937 --> 09:24.899
Hey. Destiny told me
what happened.

09:25.066 --> 09:27.944
I was just on my way to see you.
You OK?

09:28.110 --> 09:30.988
I've been better.
Where have you been?

09:31.155 --> 09:33.074
Can I use your phone
to call a cab?

09:33.241 --> 09:34.742
I'm gonna head back to my hotel.

09:34.909 --> 09:36.369
You're welcome to stay here.

09:36.535 --> 09:38.162
Bedroom's upstairs.

09:38.329 --> 09:40.331
OK.

09:44.543 --> 09:46.045
Ochoa.

09:46.212 --> 09:48.547
Uh, I have to deal with, um...

09:49.757 --> 09:51.926
I'll explain later, OK?

09:52.093 --> 09:53.636
OK.

10:10.861 --> 10:12.488
Well, I got something for you.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.740
Just let me warn you, it's...

10:14.907 --> 10:17.076
..some crazy shit.

10:17.243 --> 10:19.537
This a bad time?
You've got company.

10:19.704 --> 10:21.831
- Just a girl.
- Oh, yeah?

10:21.998 --> 10:23.249
How'd you meet her?

10:23.416 --> 10:25.668
Since when am I part
of your investigation?

10:26.877 --> 10:29.171
Which brings me to...

10:31.507 --> 10:33.217
I found this.

10:37.263 --> 10:39.056
Remind you of anyone?

11:18.012 --> 11:19.972
So, what are you saying,

11:20.139 --> 11:21.682
this is Spivak's grandfather
or something?

11:21.849 --> 11:23.726
Have you ever seen
even a father and son

11:23.893 --> 11:25.853
look exactly, completely alike?

11:27.438 --> 11:29.648
This is Spivak.

11:31.484 --> 11:34.153
But...that can't be possible.

11:35.321 --> 11:38.366
Here's the part where I sound
like a fuckin' mental case.

11:38.532 --> 11:41.702
I think we might be dealin'
with some kind of paranormal

11:41.869 --> 11:43.412
outside-the-box-type shit.

11:43.579 --> 11:45.122
Actually, um...

11:48.584 --> 11:49.960
..outside-the-box is good.

11:50.127 --> 11:51.796
Focus there.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.649
How did you know about
Omul Negru?

12:11.816 --> 12:15.653
I thought your mom didn't
teach you any upir customs.

12:19.365 --> 12:22.493
You talking about this?
And the drawing?

12:22.660 --> 12:25.454
Yeah. Omul Negru,
the upir boogieman.

12:25.621 --> 12:27.331
- You know about it?
- Yeah.

12:27.498 --> 12:29.708
Just that it's some
Carpathian peasant story.

12:29.875 --> 12:31.293
Tell me.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.254
Uh...

12:33.421 --> 12:35.381
I don't remember
a lot of details.

12:35.548 --> 12:36.966
Anything.

12:38.342 --> 12:41.011
I have this upir friend, Nate.

12:41.178 --> 12:44.306
Well, you can talk to him.
He's an anthropology professor.

12:44.473 --> 12:47.852
OK. Call him.
Call him right now.

12:48.853 --> 12:51.522
It's that important?

12:51.689 --> 12:53.357
You have no idea.

12:54.358 --> 12:58.446
Well, I could take you to him
if you want.

12:59.572 --> 13:01.073
Yeah.

13:04.285 --> 13:06.912
It was totally uncanny.
Exactly like you said.

13:07.079 --> 13:09.874
He is completely crazy,
him and the gypsy both.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.251
I just played along,

13:12.418 --> 13:13.961
and boom.

13:15.588 --> 13:17.131
But I don't mean to minimise.

13:17.298 --> 13:18.757
He didn't get into

13:18.924 --> 13:22.011
the immortal space lizard shit
that you were talkin' about.

13:22.178 --> 13:23.596
Yes, he's a lost cause.

13:23.762 --> 13:25.264
- What about Shelley?
- I was getting to that.

13:25.431 --> 13:27.641
- I'm pretty sure she's OK.
- She was there?

13:27.808 --> 13:29.268
Someone was upstairs.

13:29.435 --> 13:32.021
From the way he acted when I
asked him, guessin' it was her.

13:32.188 --> 13:35.024
Guessing is nowhere near good
enough. This is my daughter.

13:35.191 --> 13:38.402
I will set up a camera
outside of his place.

13:41.572 --> 13:43.073
Get me in there today.

13:44.909 --> 13:47.578
Breaking and entering? You do
know that is a felony, right?

14:23.948 --> 14:25.324
Oh, f...

14:25.491 --> 14:28.285
Oh. Oh, fuck!

14:28.452 --> 14:29.787
Oh!

14:29.954 --> 14:32.456
Arggh! Fuck!

14:34.124 --> 14:35.876
Oh! Oh!

14:36.043 --> 14:37.795
Ohhh.

14:41.966 --> 14:44.009
Oh, fuck.

15:01.694 --> 15:03.320
Dr Pryce!

15:20.504 --> 15:23.090
Oh, thank you. Thank you, Klaus.

15:24.383 --> 15:26.051
I'd forgotten or...

15:27.428 --> 15:28.929
..couldn't remember where
I put the...the...

15:29.096 --> 15:32.349
- Epipen.
- Exactly. Epipen.

15:32.516 --> 15:35.394
You should have been using
the containment module, sir.

15:35.561 --> 15:37.938
You're right, you're right.
Protocols.

15:38.105 --> 15:42.192
Protocols. It's just that I got
so caught up in this autopsy.

15:43.736 --> 15:45.946
I still have
more important work to do.

15:46.113 --> 15:48.866
Maybe you really just
need to get some sleep, sir.

15:50.576 --> 15:51.785
No.

15:53.037 --> 15:56.081
But, Klaus, it's just...

16:05.591 --> 16:06.592
Shelley?

16:30.741 --> 16:34.161
- Any sign?
- No.

16:34.328 --> 16:36.455
- You said she was here.
- Actually, I didn't.

16:36.622 --> 16:38.791
- You pull any shit with me...
- I'd be upset too.

16:38.957 --> 16:41.669
I'd be pissed off
if my kid ran off

16:41.835 --> 16:44.046
after taking care of her
the way that you did.

16:44.213 --> 16:45.756
Especially given how

16:45.923 --> 16:47.633
she's hangin' out with
your fuck-up son.

16:52.388 --> 16:55.516
Wherever she is,
I'm gonna find her.

17:00.104 --> 17:01.355
OK.

17:07.319 --> 17:09.988
You actually saw it.

17:10.155 --> 17:12.991
- Yeah.
- The boogieman is real.

17:17.162 --> 17:19.873
I can't believe
what you've been through.

17:20.040 --> 17:23.292
It's the worst thing
in the world, losing a child.

17:26.422 --> 17:28.006
I think about her every second.

17:32.219 --> 17:34.012
Does it ever get any better?

17:35.723 --> 17:37.683
I wish I could say yes.

17:39.893 --> 17:42.020
But you can't blame yourself.

17:44.398 --> 17:47.943
You took in this kid,
you gave her a home, loved her.

17:48.110 --> 17:51.238
You're doing everything
you can to find her.

17:53.198 --> 17:58.287
Did your cousin ever tell you
who he was, the baby's father?

17:59.705 --> 18:01.331
Just some guy.

18:12.176 --> 18:14.595
Dude, I'm not actually
going to fuck her.

18:14.762 --> 18:17.473
I'm just gonna take her home
for the night. For Facebook.

18:17.639 --> 18:20.017
- To be ironic.
- Where's Destiny?

18:21.602 --> 18:24.938
Full day of mysterious
female wedding rituals.

18:26.148 --> 18:28.817
- What's this?
- Our next job.

18:28.984 --> 18:31.779
You should have seen it.
He had a whole slide show.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.697
Very compelling.

18:34.698 --> 18:36.366
What kind of job?

18:36.533 --> 18:38.577
The fucking fantastic kind.

18:38.744 --> 18:41.538
95 Lexington Street.
Do you know it?

18:41.705 --> 18:45.167
- No.
- You should. It's a jackpot.

18:45.334 --> 18:46.752
All the cops
in western Pennsylvania,

18:46.919 --> 18:49.087
this is where they store
the guns they confiscate.

18:49.254 --> 18:51.381
Four times a year
they truck 'em away

18:51.548 --> 18:53.175
to be melted down
in a blast furnace.

18:53.342 --> 18:54.927
Next run's on Tuesday.

18:55.093 --> 18:56.762
And you're gonna rob it first?

18:56.929 --> 18:59.306
After. Too many cameras
at the storage facility.

18:59.473 --> 19:01.642
We're gonna wait until it's en
route, then hit the vehicle...

19:01.809 --> 19:03.477
..here.

19:03.644 --> 19:07.022
- Armed guards?
- Yeah.

19:07.189 --> 19:08.982
It's not Seal Team Six.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.692
Two guys makin' minimum wage

19:10.859 --> 19:13.195
likely to shoot off their own
dicks if anything goes down.

19:30.379 --> 19:32.047
So, if Nate comes off

19:32.214 --> 19:34.550
a little full of himself
at first,

19:34.716 --> 19:37.803
just remember,
he really is a genius, OK?

19:37.970 --> 19:40.764
He's kind of famous
in our community,

19:40.931 --> 19:42.641
but you'll warm up to him.

19:42.808 --> 19:44.268
He's super charismatic.

19:44.434 --> 19:46.937
You slept with him.

19:47.938 --> 19:49.815
Times Square, V-J Day.

19:49.982 --> 19:52.484
The whole city was in love.

19:53.485 --> 19:54.987
How old are you really?

19:58.407 --> 20:01.326
You know who might be helpful?
Nate's girlfriend, Hannah.

20:01.493 --> 20:04.663
Really smart.
History professor at Columbia.

20:04.830 --> 20:06.540
Mm-hm.

20:11.628 --> 20:13.797
Annie, ma belle!

20:15.173 --> 20:18.093
- Good to see you. Hm?
- Yes.

20:18.260 --> 20:21.179
- Hi. Roman.
- Nate.

20:21.346 --> 20:23.223
- Oh, it's a party.
- Now that you're here it is.

20:23.390 --> 20:24.683
Come in.

20:24.850 --> 20:28.061
That attractive young lady
setting the table...

20:28.228 --> 20:30.147
- ..is Megan Whitney.
- Hi.

20:30.314 --> 20:31.773
And you know
Julia and Mickey Hughes.

20:31.940 --> 20:34.902
- Annie!
- Nice to see you.

20:35.068 --> 20:38.155
Oh, and, everybody,
this is Roman.

20:38.322 --> 20:41.408
So, you're the baby upir!

20:42.910 --> 20:45.621
Don't worry.
We're in the tribe too.

20:47.956 --> 20:49.833
- You're upirs?
- Mm-hm.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.418
All of you?

20:51.585 --> 20:53.128
Nate told us about you,

20:53.295 --> 20:55.130
so we wanted to welcome
you to the fold.

20:55.297 --> 20:56.798
Do you all live nearby
or something?

20:56.965 --> 20:59.217
He doesn't know
about East Cornwall?

20:59.384 --> 21:01.178
I told you, he's new.

21:01.345 --> 21:05.557
Our little burg is about 35%
upir, by my own census.

21:05.724 --> 21:08.310
- Where's Hannah?
- Later.

21:14.107 --> 21:16.610
- Oh, let me guess. Your student.
- No, of course not.

21:16.777 --> 21:19.154
My physical therapist.

21:19.321 --> 21:20.989
She's getting her degree
in kinesiology.

21:21.156 --> 21:23.116
Hmm.

22:27.764 --> 22:29.474
Klau... Klaus.

22:30.600 --> 22:33.145
How are you? Welcome!

22:33.311 --> 22:37.065
Dr Pryce, um,
you promised to get some sleep.

22:38.984 --> 22:40.360
And I will.

22:40.527 --> 22:42.404
But as I was drifting off,
I had a thought.

22:42.571 --> 22:44.823
The specific anaplastic
cellular structures

22:44.990 --> 22:46.700
resemble the procession

22:46.867 --> 22:48.285
of the horsemen
in the Parthenon frieze,

22:48.452 --> 22:50.370
which reminded me of an article
in the 'Lancet'

22:50.537 --> 22:52.164
about equine telomeres
in cellular immortalisation.

22:52.330 --> 22:54.750
Which has prompted a theory

22:54.916 --> 22:58.336
about the physiology
of the Spivak creature's...

23:02.841 --> 23:05.052
Well, in short,

23:05.218 --> 23:07.179
drumming is helping me
access my right brain.

23:07.345 --> 23:11.099
I am making some REAL progress
finding my shadow!

23:15.687 --> 23:18.315
Ula-ula-ula-ula. Hai!

23:18.482 --> 23:20.108
Hai!

23:21.610 --> 23:23.111
It's called potentisation.

23:23.278 --> 23:24.946
The more you dilute a poison,

23:25.113 --> 23:26.656
the stronger it becomes
as a cure.

23:26.823 --> 23:28.950
Homeopathy is generally
considered, um,

23:29.117 --> 23:31.286
a pseudo-science, Megan.

23:31.453 --> 23:33.830
Call it what you want.
I have seen it work.

23:35.123 --> 23:37.667
When can I talk to him about...

23:37.834 --> 23:39.461
He said after dinner.

23:39.628 --> 23:41.296
If you don't mind my asking,

23:41.463 --> 23:43.548
what have you been doing
in the way of sustenance

23:43.715 --> 23:45.967
since you turned?

23:46.968 --> 23:49.221
- Whatever I could find.
- Ah.

23:49.387 --> 23:50.931
You've been hunting.

23:51.098 --> 23:54.684
- No. Not really.
- It's OK if you have.

23:54.851 --> 23:56.770
I can't imagine
what it would be like

23:56.937 --> 23:58.438
without learning
non-violent feeding

23:58.605 --> 23:59.940
from a responsible adult.

24:00.107 --> 24:01.650
There is a support group...

24:01.817 --> 24:04.528
No, honestly, I'm not hunting.

24:04.694 --> 24:06.530
The kid's fine. Leave him alone.

24:06.696 --> 24:11.118
Now, I have a very special
amuse-bouche prepared.

24:11.284 --> 24:13.245
What is that?

24:13.411 --> 24:15.038
Is it AB negative?

24:15.205 --> 24:16.957
That's for pishers.

24:17.124 --> 24:19.459
This, my dear friends...

24:21.753 --> 24:23.630
..is the holy fucking grail.

24:23.797 --> 24:25.465
Oh, my God.

24:25.632 --> 24:27.551
You want some?

24:31.888 --> 24:34.933
Mm! Jesus Christ!

24:35.100 --> 24:37.644
Rh null! Oh!

24:37.811 --> 24:40.021
Oh, I know! My parents told me
about it, but...

24:40.188 --> 24:42.983
This is why I became a
phlebotomist. Come, come, come.

24:45.652 --> 24:48.071
Thank you.

24:59.875 --> 25:00.876
Mm!

25:01.877 --> 25:06.673
The metallic notes on the end.
It's iron-rich and...

25:08.466 --> 25:10.635
You can tell the donor's
a real meat-eater, can't you?

25:10.802 --> 25:12.929
Pretty incredible, right?

25:13.096 --> 25:15.557
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

25:15.724 --> 25:18.518
What's, um, Rh null?

25:18.685 --> 25:22.022
It's the rarest blood type.
Um...

25:22.189 --> 25:25.984
I think there's only 40 donors
in the world that we know of.

25:26.151 --> 25:28.361
Sorry, it's just...

25:29.487 --> 25:31.865
I want to show you something.

25:35.911 --> 25:37.370
Use plenty of disinfectant

25:37.537 --> 25:39.331
on Miss Ironic
before you bring her back.

25:39.497 --> 25:41.625
Ah, you wish, brother.

25:41.791 --> 25:44.002
I was just wondering...

25:45.003 --> 25:47.881
..the cops are making two stops
to drop off the guns?

25:48.048 --> 25:49.549
Yeah.

25:49.716 --> 25:51.968
Why?

25:52.135 --> 25:53.887
Spread the business around.

25:54.054 --> 25:56.598
I don't know.
You have to ask them.

25:56.765 --> 25:58.225
The second stop is
a blast furnace,

25:58.391 --> 26:00.060
which makes sense for the guns,

26:00.227 --> 26:02.938
but the first one
is a medical waste incinerator,

26:03.104 --> 26:05.774
so they're probably
dropping off drugs too.

26:05.941 --> 26:08.151
I guess.

26:09.152 --> 26:10.779
In which case

26:10.946 --> 26:13.365
the smart play would be
to make the move here...

26:15.742 --> 26:18.161
..instead of doing armed robbery
here in the middle

26:18.328 --> 26:21.206
of a busy downtown street
in the middle of the day.

26:23.917 --> 26:26.002
Unless you're after
the drugs too.

26:26.169 --> 26:29.214
You said you didn't want to be
involved in any new business.

26:30.215 --> 26:32.634
Consider yourself not involved.

26:32.801 --> 26:35.011
You're slinging heroin now?

26:35.178 --> 26:37.514
Who gives a shit if a bunch
of rich gadje shoot up?

26:37.681 --> 26:39.516
They're gonna do it anyway.

26:39.683 --> 26:41.059
What will the wolf pack say

26:41.226 --> 26:43.061
when they see you
tossing dope into your truck?

26:43.228 --> 26:45.063
They're gonna be psyched
they got a Christmas bonus.

26:45.230 --> 26:47.857
Do you think your family
would support this?

26:48.024 --> 26:50.068
- You think my mother would?
- You sold that Sebzilla shit.

26:50.235 --> 26:53.613
That was powdered milk, Andreas.
I was running game.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.740
You brought a drug deal
into Destiny's home.

26:57.450 --> 26:59.244
My home too, Peter.

27:00.870 --> 27:04.040
The Roma are not drug dealers.

27:05.208 --> 27:07.294
You're telling me
what the Roma are.

27:09.671 --> 27:11.131
Until I brought you
into this group,

27:11.298 --> 27:14.092
you were practically a gadje.

27:14.259 --> 27:18.054
You had nothing.
You were nothing.

27:18.221 --> 27:20.557
You really want to step to me,
mother-fucker?

27:32.027 --> 27:34.195
Oh, shit.

27:34.362 --> 27:36.448
Oh, God. I'm really...

27:36.614 --> 27:39.200
I'm really sorry, Peter.

27:40.452 --> 27:42.078
I'm...

27:42.245 --> 27:44.247
I'm so stressed out.

27:44.414 --> 27:46.458
With the wedding.

27:46.624 --> 27:47.959
And the job.

27:49.627 --> 27:51.129
Whew.

27:53.340 --> 27:55.675
I...I promise, and we're...

27:55.842 --> 27:57.260
We're gonna figure this out.

27:57.427 --> 27:59.304
We'll both be happy.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.182
So, the drugs?

28:02.349 --> 28:04.351
Oh, it's just details.

28:04.517 --> 28:07.520
Come on, we're brothers now.

28:07.687 --> 28:09.981
Let's not let business
get in the way.

28:18.114 --> 28:19.574
Smells good.

28:19.741 --> 28:22.160
Blood pudding.

28:22.327 --> 28:24.079
Hm.

28:24.245 --> 28:26.164
What's in it?

28:26.331 --> 28:29.376
Immunoglobulin,
amino acids, plasma.

28:29.542 --> 28:33.296
We all bring a different
ingredient. Everyone shares it.

28:33.463 --> 28:36.174
It brings everyone together.

28:37.258 --> 28:38.885
Here you go.

28:48.103 --> 28:50.188
That's good.

28:50.355 --> 28:52.482
Fantastic, in fact.

28:54.359 --> 28:55.527
Oh.

28:57.862 --> 28:59.572
Did you want to chat
before dinner?

28:59.739 --> 29:01.408
Yes, please.

29:03.076 --> 29:04.953
I'm good, I'm good.

29:16.297 --> 29:18.758
Come on!

29:18.925 --> 29:20.301
I swear,

29:20.468 --> 29:24.848
you have the most chaotic face
I have ever seen.

29:26.474 --> 29:29.686
This whole upper right quadrant
seems to be...

29:30.895 --> 29:34.190
..gallopin' in a different
direction than the rest of it.

29:39.737 --> 29:41.489
May I?

30:01.593 --> 30:04.762
They say that beauty
is determined by symmetry.

30:06.473 --> 30:08.224
But I gotta say...

30:09.809 --> 30:14.355
..I find your whole gestalt
cool and unexpected.

30:19.235 --> 30:21.571
I'm Aitor Quantic, by the way.

30:23.740 --> 30:25.325
Shelley.

30:26.326 --> 30:29.496
Why do you come here every day?

30:30.497 --> 30:32.832
I'm supposed to take
expired food to the dump,

30:32.999 --> 30:35.668
but it's...it's
completely edible.

30:36.794 --> 30:39.214
They just want you to
throw it away so you buy more.

30:39.380 --> 30:41.591
So I bring it here.

30:41.758 --> 30:44.010
Waste not, want not
and so forth.

30:45.762 --> 30:48.181
How about you?

30:49.182 --> 30:50.975
What about me?

30:51.142 --> 30:53.228
What brings you to Rooster Poot?

30:54.521 --> 30:57.899
Well, that's what the residents
call this place,

30:58.066 --> 31:00.818
but I've yet to see a rooster
around here,

31:00.985 --> 31:05.156
and I wouldn't know a poot
if I stepped on one.

31:07.492 --> 31:09.244
But getting back to you.

31:11.829 --> 31:14.290
Just needed a place to stay.

31:16.459 --> 31:20.755
Well, as places go,
it's upwind of the dump.

31:22.340 --> 31:24.717
I've stayed in worse.

31:26.678 --> 31:28.179
Come on down if you get hungry.

31:28.346 --> 31:30.265
We got pinto beans.

31:30.431 --> 31:32.684
All you can eat.

31:43.152 --> 31:46.030
You think you actually
saw something like this?

31:46.197 --> 31:49.409
Not like.
That's exactly what I saw.

31:55.331 --> 31:57.250
- You're certain?
- 100%.

32:01.546 --> 32:03.298
Holy fuck.

32:03.464 --> 32:05.216
No, no, no.

32:06.634 --> 32:08.511
Uh...

32:08.678 --> 32:10.597
Here it is. I'm always
losing this fucking thing.

32:14.100 --> 32:15.727
This is
an illuminated manuscript

32:15.893 --> 32:19.147
from 14th-century Norway.

32:22.025 --> 32:23.943
It's him.

32:24.110 --> 32:26.070
The JÃ¶rmungandr.

32:26.237 --> 32:28.656
That's what the Norse myths
call it at least.

32:28.823 --> 32:31.367
It goes by other names too.

32:31.534 --> 32:34.454
The Omul Negru. Um...

32:34.621 --> 32:37.290
The Babylonians called it
something completely different.

32:37.457 --> 32:39.083
So, what is it?

32:40.543 --> 32:42.629
The myths say it was a serpent

32:42.795 --> 32:45.131
dropped into the ocean
by the gods.

32:45.298 --> 32:47.258
It grew so large,

32:47.425 --> 32:50.136
wrapped itself
around the entire world

32:50.303 --> 32:53.264
until it was able
to bite its own tail.

32:53.431 --> 32:55.892
And it foretold the end of days,

32:56.059 --> 32:58.186
when the JÃ¶rmungandr
would constrict...

32:59.604 --> 33:02.857
..choking all other life
on the planet.

33:04.525 --> 33:06.653
The Ouroboros.

33:07.654 --> 33:09.238
The Apocalypse.

33:09.405 --> 33:10.865
It can't be real.

33:11.032 --> 33:12.492
As a single entity, no.

33:12.659 --> 33:14.118
I think I would have noticed

33:14.285 --> 33:15.703
a giant dragon wrapped
around the Earth.

33:15.870 --> 33:17.872
But I do have a theory
I've been working on

33:18.039 --> 33:19.791
with some palaeogeneticists.

33:19.957 --> 33:22.293
I think the JÃ¶rmungandr
wasn't a single entity,

33:22.460 --> 33:24.379
but our ancient memory

33:24.545 --> 33:26.422
of an entire species,

33:26.589 --> 33:29.050
our evolutionary adversaries,
if you will.

33:29.217 --> 33:32.387
Anyways, I think
we wiped them all out,

33:32.553 --> 33:36.099
just like the homo sapiens
did to the Neanderthals.

33:36.265 --> 33:38.976
Think again.

33:39.143 --> 33:43.398
And what would it be like,
the one who survived?

33:45.316 --> 33:48.653
Well, if the folk tales
about the Omul Negru

33:48.820 --> 33:51.572
have any basis in reality...

33:52.573 --> 33:56.744
..it's...
..inconceivably vicious.

33:57.745 --> 33:59.747
Like, there's this one story
out of the Crimea...

33:59.914 --> 34:00.748
Nate...

34:00.915 --> 34:02.500
..that is just totally
fucking insane.

34:02.667 --> 34:05.753
No, listen - take whole children
and grind them up into sausages.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.547
Shut up!

34:07.714 --> 34:09.924
Shut the fuck up.

34:14.929 --> 34:16.556
What the hell was that?

34:20.435 --> 34:21.978
Megan?

34:27.650 --> 34:29.360
Megan?

34:35.366 --> 34:36.659
Megan?

34:42.290 --> 34:44.292
Can we just stick
to what's important here?

34:46.085 --> 34:47.628
How well do you know this guy?

34:47.795 --> 34:51.382
- Well enough.
- Is he on drugs? Is he crazy?

34:51.549 --> 34:54.594
- If there's any truth to what...
- I believe him.

34:59.432 --> 35:03.352
Annie, this is world-changing,
epic shit.

35:04.979 --> 35:07.315
I need to get him in a room
with a video camera

35:07.482 --> 35:08.983
and any documentation
he has that...

35:10.651 --> 35:12.278
OK. I'll get it.

35:12.445 --> 35:14.238
You go talk to him.

35:20.161 --> 35:21.454
Yes?

35:24.540 --> 35:27.084
Hi, Annie. You look great.

35:27.251 --> 35:28.711
Hannah?

35:32.632 --> 35:35.134
What's going on?

35:37.553 --> 35:39.305
We gotta get out of here.

35:41.015 --> 35:42.517
Roman, we gotta go!

35:42.683 --> 35:44.519
- What's going on?
- It's...

35:44.685 --> 35:46.437
Oh, God...

35:46.604 --> 35:47.814
Megan!

36:07.875 --> 36:09.418
Where do we go?
Where do we go?!

36:09.585 --> 36:11.254
This way! Follow me!

36:13.714 --> 36:16.801
- Wait! My wife!
- There's no fucking time, man.

36:16.968 --> 36:19.554
- She's gone!
- I have to! I have to!

36:20.721 --> 36:23.182
Let's go.

36:23.349 --> 36:26.727
Come on. Hurry up! This way!

36:30.022 --> 36:31.649
Get in!

36:38.406 --> 36:41.284
Those were...
Those were Hannah's cousins.

36:41.450 --> 36:43.411
They're running in packs now.

36:43.578 --> 36:45.872
- It's spreading somehow.
- Wait, you've seen this before?

36:46.038 --> 36:47.790
Just one.

36:47.957 --> 36:50.543
Some kind of disease
upirs are getting.

36:50.710 --> 36:52.503
Great.

36:52.670 --> 36:55.840
Like the fuckin' boogieman
being real wasn't enough.

36:59.343 --> 37:01.220
OK. We've got to barricade...

37:01.387 --> 37:02.930
Arggh!

37:13.274 --> 37:14.984
Arggh!

37:24.452 --> 37:26.078
Annie, open the door.

37:26.245 --> 37:28.497
We'll feed on the others
and we'll let you go.

37:28.664 --> 37:31.667
Oh, you're going to let her go?
Total fucking lie, Hannah.

37:31.834 --> 37:34.211
Says the guy
who was fucking his masseuse.

37:34.378 --> 37:37.131
She's a kinesiologist,
you fucking psycho!

37:41.385 --> 37:44.764
Did you know
that hippopotami

37:44.931 --> 37:47.892
are the closest relative
to the whale?

37:48.059 --> 37:49.769
No way.

37:49.936 --> 37:51.812
That's a true, actual fact,

37:51.979 --> 37:55.566
because at one time whales,

37:55.733 --> 37:58.736
or the, uh, mammals
that became whales,

37:58.903 --> 38:01.405
they walked on dry land.

38:04.200 --> 38:06.702
And then, 50 million years ago
or thereabout,

38:06.869 --> 38:09.538
they decided to pull up stakes

38:09.705 --> 38:12.375
and head back to the ocean
from whence they came.

38:14.502 --> 38:15.670
Why?

38:18.673 --> 38:20.716
One individual.

38:20.883 --> 38:23.928
Let's call him, uh, Moe.

38:25.096 --> 38:27.014
He did not look like the others.

38:27.181 --> 38:31.060
He... He was an outcast,
and he was fat.

38:31.227 --> 38:33.896
He had short arms and tiny feet.

38:35.022 --> 38:37.024
But see,
Moe was soon to discover

38:37.191 --> 38:39.068
that being an outcast

38:39.235 --> 38:41.112
also gave him power,

38:41.278 --> 38:44.073
because he was forced

38:44.240 --> 38:46.409
to think for his self.

38:46.575 --> 38:50.454
He was tough
'cause nobody had his back.

38:53.708 --> 38:55.209
So into the drink he goes.

38:55.376 --> 38:57.378
He's splashin' around,
he's havin' a grand old time.

38:57.545 --> 38:59.797
Now, the others saw this,
and they went,

38:59.964 --> 39:01.590
"Hm,

39:01.757 --> 39:03.801
"I want me some of that."

39:05.219 --> 39:08.597
Which is how fat Moe,
the outcast,

39:08.764 --> 39:11.600
became wet Moses...

39:12.852 --> 39:15.312
..the first whale
who led his pod

39:15.479 --> 39:19.066
out of their vapid,
mud-caked existence

39:19.233 --> 39:22.153
and into the vast blue ocean.

39:23.571 --> 39:27.158
A place where there is never
a rainy day.

39:38.210 --> 39:39.962
Hey!

39:41.088 --> 39:45.301
So, did you get my message?
Should we invite the Nehamkins?

39:45.468 --> 39:49.138
Uh... Old Nehamkins
or young Nehamkins?

39:49.305 --> 39:52.850
Well, both, because
we went to their wedding.

39:53.017 --> 39:54.727
But then if we invite them,

39:54.894 --> 39:56.312
we have to invite
the whole Dimitri clan,

39:56.479 --> 39:58.814
in which case we'll need a
crowbar to pry Uncle Pavel off

39:58.981 --> 40:02.234
of every single woman
under the age of 75, so...

40:02.401 --> 40:03.861
Nehamkins -

40:04.028 --> 40:07.073
yea or nay?

40:07.239 --> 40:10.201
I don't really have an opinion.

40:11.786 --> 40:13.037
So...

40:14.038 --> 40:15.915
..what are you doing here?

40:17.917 --> 40:20.002
Have you ever thought maybe...

40:21.045 --> 40:23.380
..you're rushing into
this whole thing?

40:23.547 --> 40:28.010
I mean, how well do you
really know this guy, really?

40:29.011 --> 40:30.596
This guy?

40:30.763 --> 40:32.765
Andreas is "this guy" now?

40:32.932 --> 40:35.226
You've only been together
for two months.

40:37.269 --> 40:39.021
Did you get in a fight?

40:39.188 --> 40:43.109
I'm... I'm just sayin'.

40:43.275 --> 40:45.319
You can read people
better than anyone.

40:55.454 --> 40:57.414
I get what
you're going through.

40:59.458 --> 41:03.087
Losing Letha, the baby, and now
you feel like you're losing me,

41:03.254 --> 41:05.005
but you're not.

41:05.172 --> 41:06.882
You need to let go

41:07.049 --> 41:09.385
so that I can live my life.

41:11.095 --> 41:12.930
Ride or die notwithstanding.

41:16.600 --> 41:18.727
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

41:24.358 --> 41:28.112
- Any sign of them?
- Not for a while now.

41:29.113 --> 41:31.907
- You've got bars on your phone?
- No.

41:36.203 --> 41:37.621
My neighbour has a land line.

41:37.788 --> 41:39.331
One of you should run for it.

41:39.498 --> 41:41.458
- One of us?
- I tore my ACL.

41:41.625 --> 41:43.878
- 30 years ago, Nate.
- Yeah, but it still hurts a lot.

41:44.044 --> 41:45.671
Fuck it. I'll do it.

41:45.838 --> 41:47.506
No, no, no. No, wait.

41:47.673 --> 41:49.341
You don't even know
where he lives.

41:49.508 --> 41:52.136
It's really easy. Just go down
the road, underneath the bridge.

41:52.303 --> 41:54.513
He's right there and you can't
miss him. Go. Get going.

41:54.680 --> 41:55.514
Great.

41:55.681 --> 41:58.809
No, no. And if they're still
out there?

42:01.228 --> 42:03.272
Then I'll run.

42:40.309 --> 42:42.478
We got one.

43:00.120 --> 43:03.666
- Open up! They're coming!
- No. No.

43:03.832 --> 43:06.752
If you open it,
they'll kill us too.

43:09.964 --> 43:12.675
Annie, what the fuck?!

43:17.054 --> 43:18.931
Sorry, I can't help it.

43:44.498 --> 43:46.208
Roman!

43:48.252 --> 43:50.546
The barrel.

43:58.262 --> 44:01.223
Oh, fuck.

44:12.109 --> 44:13.902
Any abnormal bleeding?

44:14.069 --> 44:16.739
No. Is my cancer back?

44:16.905 --> 44:18.490
Is that why I can't feed?

44:18.657 --> 44:20.993
No. No reason to think that.

44:21.160 --> 44:23.996
And did you get a flu shot
earlier this year?

44:24.163 --> 44:25.581
- I don't have the flu.
- So it seems.

44:25.748 --> 44:27.333
But as for the shot?

44:27.499 --> 44:29.585
Yes. Yes, I got a flu shot.

44:29.752 --> 44:31.086
Norman dragged me there.

44:31.253 --> 44:32.796
At the pharmacy?

44:32.963 --> 44:35.090
No, Dr Spivak's nurse
gave it to me.

44:35.257 --> 44:37.051
Oh, God.

44:37.217 --> 44:38.802
Did Spivak do something to me?

44:38.969 --> 44:41.305
He gave you a flu shot,
apparently.

44:41.472 --> 44:44.933
Stop fucking with me, Johann.
What is this about?

44:45.100 --> 44:47.353
When I have a diagnosis,
you'll be the first to know.

44:50.147 --> 44:52.524
In the meantime, I'd urge you

44:52.691 --> 44:54.401
to consider taking drum lessons.

44:54.568 --> 44:56.945
I couldn't have gotten in touch
with my shadow without them.

45:03.327 --> 45:05.996
The dark. They're in the dark.

45:06.163 --> 45:08.248
They're always
in the fucking dark.

45:17.424 --> 45:19.051
You feeling alright?

45:19.218 --> 45:20.719
Dark.

45:20.886 --> 45:23.389
All the attacks are in the dark.

45:24.723 --> 45:26.433
Here. In Hemlock too.

45:26.600 --> 45:28.227
I turned the light on outside.

45:28.394 --> 45:30.687
They were fucked up.
They were disoriented.

45:30.854 --> 45:33.190
The tumour is wrapped
around the optic nerve.

45:33.357 --> 45:35.442
Maybe they're sensitive
to sunlight.

45:35.609 --> 45:37.820
We just wait them out.

45:37.986 --> 45:40.155
They'll have to leave
before sunrise.

47:10.871 --> 47:14.500
I now own a suit,
and it didn't fall off a truck.

47:16.210 --> 47:18.378
Two milestones reached.

47:34.561 --> 47:37.439
I promise you we're going to
get out of here, OK?

47:46.698 --> 47:48.325
Nadia's mine.

47:49.326 --> 47:51.995
I'm the father.

47:54.456 --> 47:55.749
Letha...

47:56.875 --> 47:58.585
She was my cousin.

47:58.752 --> 48:00.796
No.

48:00.963 --> 48:03.423
She was my half-sister.

48:05.509 --> 48:07.427
I fucked her...

48:08.595 --> 48:11.014
..and she died.

48:16.436 --> 48:18.647
My mother, she forced me
into doing it.

48:20.816 --> 48:23.402
Against my will,
against Letha's will.

48:25.779 --> 48:27.656
I didn't remember anything.

48:27.823 --> 48:29.074
God.

48:31.201 --> 48:34.079
It was all part of
some fucked-up plan of hers

48:34.246 --> 48:37.249
to make me the way she was.

48:37.416 --> 48:39.334
And it worked.

48:40.794 --> 48:43.213
Letha didn't know?

48:44.715 --> 48:46.967
She thought the dad
was an angel.

49:04.359 --> 49:06.445
One day my daughter's
gonna ask me...

49:07.446 --> 49:09.531
..who her father is.

49:10.616 --> 49:12.367
And I'm gonna
have to tell her

49:12.534 --> 49:16.371
who I am and what I did.

49:17.414 --> 49:19.750
It scares me.

49:21.627 --> 49:24.296
It scares me way more
than those things out there.

49:30.427 --> 49:33.388
If your daughter asks,
you lie to her.

49:35.265 --> 49:36.850
That's what parents do.

49:38.685 --> 49:40.520
Oh, Christ!

49:40.687 --> 49:43.940
You know, I'm scared too,
but you don't see me crying.

49:53.909 --> 49:56.244
Nate, help us!

49:59.039 --> 50:00.666
Fucking coward!

50:19.601 --> 50:21.978
- Hi, honey.
- Oh!

50:22.145 --> 50:23.689
Arggh!

50:38.328 --> 50:39.788
Oh, fuck.

50:41.373 --> 50:42.833
Oh, fuck!

50:50.006 --> 50:52.008
Girls, get over here.

50:56.638 --> 50:58.974
We gotta leave. Come on.

51:12.154 --> 51:14.614
Yeah, I got, you know,
however many you need.

51:14.781 --> 51:17.659
We got a ton of them.

51:42.809 --> 51:45.061
I got to thinking,

51:45.228 --> 51:48.690
that stuff
I said about symmetry and...

51:50.525 --> 51:53.987
..your face and whatnot.

51:54.154 --> 51:56.865
I say weird things sometimes.

51:57.991 --> 52:00.660
I sure didn't mean
to make you uncomfortable.

52:03.079 --> 52:06.750
Because, you know,
the other thing besides symmetry

52:06.917 --> 52:08.835
that determines beauty...

52:10.128 --> 52:11.755
Big eyes.

52:13.006 --> 52:15.550
And let me tell you,

52:15.717 --> 52:18.178
you got that in spades.

52:19.679 --> 52:21.681
Big eye.

52:23.725 --> 52:27.854
You look like one of those Keane
paintings of the kids.

52:29.981 --> 52:31.900
From the side, at least.

52:32.943 --> 52:36.238
From the front,
I'm a Dali painting.

52:41.535 --> 52:44.996
This was my dad's place,
this mill.

52:46.289 --> 52:47.958
Yeah, I kind of knew that.

52:49.292 --> 52:51.503
You're pretty recognisable.

52:55.799 --> 52:57.425
Well...

52:58.426 --> 53:00.846
So technically
you own Rooster Poot.

53:04.307 --> 53:07.394
No-one owns Rooster Poot.

55:01.257 --> 55:04.094
Over the last 24 hours,
your friend Dr Pryce

55:04.260 --> 55:05.762
went on a Google rampage.

55:05.929 --> 55:08.306
Some videos of this drummer
named Gene Krupa,

55:08.473 --> 55:10.558
but mostly about this place
called Plum Island.

55:10.725 --> 55:13.561
Apparently, it was a government
germ laboratory in the '40s.

55:13.728 --> 55:15.897
He found an old medical film
and watched it a bunch.

55:16.064 --> 55:19.067
- What's on it?
- You should probably watch it.

55:19.234 --> 55:20.151
Um...

55:20.318 --> 55:22.612
Maybe it'll make sense to you.
