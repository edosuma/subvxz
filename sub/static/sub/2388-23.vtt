00:00.502 --> 00:03.508
<i>In 1994, Robin's dad took her</i>
<i>to New York City</i>

00:03.509 --> 00:04.859
<i>for the first time...</i>

00:04.861 --> 00:07.361
This is amazing!
Thank you, sir!

00:07.363 --> 00:09.947
Wella little father-son
bonding trip never hurt anyone.

00:09.949 --> 00:12.783
I-I did almost die
from malnutrition

00:12.785 --> 00:14.518
on that wolf hunt last year...

00:14.520 --> 00:16.520
I had to almost kill you

00:16.522 --> 00:17.738
for you to learn how to kill.

00:17.740 --> 00:20.691
New York City's the best, eh?

00:20.693 --> 00:22.043
I despise it.
It's like Edmonton,

00:22.045 --> 00:23.911
minus the arts and culture.

00:23.913 --> 00:25.162
Come on, we'll miss our flight.

00:25.164 --> 00:26.747
I'll catch up.

00:28.533 --> 00:31.201
One day, I'm gonna move here,

00:31.203 --> 00:34.422
marry a sophisticated
big-city man

00:34.424 --> 00:36.474
with a sick mullet--

00:36.476 --> 00:39.543
like all the way down to his
shoulder pads,

00:39.545 --> 00:40.561
and at night,

00:40.563 --> 00:43.047
he'll let me brush it...

00:43.049 --> 00:46.934
and I'll dig up this locket

00:46.936 --> 00:51.388
so it can be my "something old"
at our wedding.

00:52.190 --> 00:53.223
R.J.!

00:53.225 --> 00:54.658
Coming, sir!

00:56.394 --> 00:57.995
I'll be back for you.

01:00.582 --> 01:03.934
Back then, I was...

01:03.936 --> 01:04.968
but we're closer now.

01:06.222 --> 01:08.189
I feel like I don't have to hide
my feminine side anymore

01:08.191 --> 01:09.473
just because you've
always wanted a...

01:09.475 --> 01:11.475
Son!
It's Barney!

01:11.477 --> 01:13.060
Great!

01:13.062 --> 01:14.695
I'll be there in 15, B-dawg.

01:14.697 --> 01:16.097
Woof, woof!

01:18.568 --> 01:20.017
That's our thing.

01:20.019 --> 01:21.702
Uh... be where in 15?

01:21.704 --> 01:22.787
Laser tag.

01:22.789 --> 01:24.572
Never been.
B-dawg's gonna teach me.

01:24.574 --> 01:28.125
Look, I-I think that it's great
that you and Barney are...

01:28.127 --> 01:28.959
B-dawg.

01:28.961 --> 01:31.662
...B-dawg are bonding,

01:31.664 --> 01:34.364
but, um... you agreed
to help me with this.

01:34.366 --> 01:35.800
Fine.

01:35.802 --> 01:37.718
Where did you bury this tampon?

01:37.720 --> 01:38.719
It's a locket.

01:38.721 --> 01:39.737
I'm sorry, I get all these

01:39.739 --> 01:42.373
girlie things confused.

01:42.375 --> 01:44.425
Do you need my help or not?

01:45.811 --> 01:47.728
Nah, it's stupid.

01:49.515 --> 01:51.882
<i>So while Robin searched</i>
<i>for her something old,</i>

01:51.884 --> 01:54.268
<i>Lily and Marshall packed</i>
<i>for their something new:</i>

01:54.270 --> 01:56.504
Lily's year-long art consultant
<i>gig in Italy.</i>

01:56.506 --> 01:58.555
I still can't believe

01:58.557 --> 02:00.524
we have to say goodbye
to this place...

02:00.526 --> 02:02.443
Oh. I know, baby.

02:02.445 --> 02:04.912
But look at it as an excuse
to simplify our lives.

02:04.914 --> 02:06.580
You know, we can't bring
everything to Italy,

02:06.582 --> 02:08.082
so we gotta throw out
some junk.

02:08.084 --> 02:10.668
For example, look...

02:10.669 --> 02:12.036
my old Sasquatch binders

02:12.038 --> 02:14.121
that "I could never throw away"

02:14.123 --> 02:15.923
because
"I was gonna be the guy

02:15.925 --> 02:17.675
who proved the existence
of Bigfoot..."

02:17.677 --> 02:18.909
These are obviously
coming to Italy.

02:18.911 --> 02:20.127
But these handbags?

02:20.129 --> 02:21.212
Gonzo.

02:21.214 --> 02:22.513
No way!

02:22.515 --> 02:25.582
These have sentimental
meaning to me.

02:25.584 --> 02:27.384
Didn't you shop-lift these
in your 20s?

02:27.386 --> 02:29.937
Yes, and I get very nostalgic
for that time.

02:29.939 --> 02:33.257
You get older, you have kids,
you stop stealing, it's sad.

02:33.259 --> 02:34.275
Lily...

02:34.277 --> 02:35.759
we just don't have
room for these.

02:35.761 --> 02:38.896
Oh, but you get to keep
your Bigfoot binders?

02:38.898 --> 02:42.432
Wait, why is this one
just December 1999?

02:42.434 --> 02:44.952
Oh. Y2K was coming.

02:44.954 --> 02:47.988
Lot of people took to the woods.

02:47.990 --> 02:49.740
Saw the truth.

02:49.742 --> 02:53.043
Okay, Marshall, we don't
have time to argue

02:53.045 --> 02:54.778
over what stays and what goes.

02:54.780 --> 02:56.881
Ooh, you know who
we gotta bring in?

02:56.883 --> 02:59.834
Okay, I agree he is
good at this stuff,

02:59.836 --> 03:01.836
but he just gets so cocky.

03:01.838 --> 03:03.120
No, he doesn't.

03:06.457 --> 03:08.943
So I heard you guys have
a bit of a...

03:08.945 --> 03:11.512
packing situation.

03:11.514 --> 03:13.797
I acknowledge now
this was a mistake.

03:13.799 --> 03:17.101
Look, I came here to chew
bubblegum and pack boxes.

03:17.103 --> 03:19.820
And I'm all out of bubble...

03:19.822 --> 03:21.972
Oh, my God.... Oh, my God.

03:21.974 --> 03:24.441
I swallowed it.

03:24.443 --> 03:25.976
Is that bad?

03:25.978 --> 03:27.495
Okay, thank you.

03:27.497 --> 03:29.246
Well, Dr. Goldsmith says
I should be fine.

03:29.248 --> 03:31.081
I just have to look for it
in my stool.

03:31.867 --> 03:34.451
So as I was saying...

03:34.453 --> 03:36.520
I heard you guys have
a bit of a...

03:36.522 --> 03:39.173
packing situation.

03:51.970 --> 03:53.804
Now, as you know,

03:53.806 --> 03:57.041
I'm a bit of a legend
when it comes to packing.

03:57.043 --> 03:58.726
We know.
We know.

03:58.728 --> 04:00.444
Tales are still told

04:00.446 --> 04:03.030
<i>of the time I traveled</i>
<i>all through Spain...</i>

04:04.515 --> 04:06.734
<i>...for two weeks...</i>

04:07.852 --> 04:09.787
<i>...with everything I needed</i>

04:09.789 --> 04:13.624
<i>efficiently packed into</i>
<i>a hands-free belt satchel.</i>

04:13.626 --> 04:15.525
<i>The locals called me...</i>

04:22.132 --> 04:25.052
Yeah, it's not a "hands-free
belt satchel," Ted.

04:25.054 --> 04:26.053
It's a fanny pack.

04:26.055 --> 04:27.838
It's not a fanny pack.

04:27.840 --> 04:30.925
In Spanish,
<i>El Ganso con la Riñonera</i>

04:30.927 --> 04:32.760
means "Fanny Pack Dork."

04:32.762 --> 04:33.928
No, it doesn't.

04:33.930 --> 04:36.380
It means "Packer of Great Skill
and Merit."

04:36.382 --> 04:37.598
<i>I looked it up.</i>

04:37.600 --> 04:39.767
<i>It means"Fanny Pack Dork."</i>

04:39.769 --> 04:42.719
And as a Packer
of Great Skill and Merit,

04:42.721 --> 04:46.240
I will tell you how to pack
with Tetris-like precision.

04:46.242 --> 04:48.776
We get it, you pack
a lot in your fanny.

04:48.778 --> 04:50.444
Obvious yet delightful.

04:50.446 --> 04:51.495
Okay.

04:51.497 --> 04:52.980
I got a big interview at 3:00

04:52.982 --> 04:54.415
about possibly designing
another building.

04:54.417 --> 04:57.234
Until then,
if you abide by my rulings,

04:57.236 --> 04:59.403
I will tell you
what goes to Italy

04:59.405 --> 05:02.923
and what goes in...
The Triangle.

05:02.925 --> 05:05.676
<i>Kids, as you know,</i>
<i>"The Bermuda Triangle"</i>

05:05.678 --> 05:07.411
<i>was the name we gave</i>
<i>to the curb</i>

05:07.413 --> 05:08.545
<i>right outside our apartment,</i>

05:08.547 --> 05:11.298
<i>which possessed</i>
<i>the magical ability</i>

05:11.300 --> 05:13.601
<i>to make any item disappear.</i>

05:13.603 --> 05:14.802
<i>Instantly.</i>

05:14.804 --> 05:16.920
The biggest rule for
de-cluttering is,

05:16.922 --> 05:19.974
"Have you used it
in the last year?"

05:19.976 --> 05:22.643
If not... Triangle.

05:23.612 --> 05:26.397
Have you used this jump rope
in the last year?

05:26.399 --> 05:27.399
Are you kidding?

05:27.400 --> 05:29.283
I hop threads
every morning, son!

05:29.285 --> 05:31.485
Do three in a row
and you can keep it.

05:34.339 --> 05:35.406
Well-played, Mosby.

05:35.408 --> 05:37.791
Next!

05:39.327 --> 05:41.078
Have you used it
in the last year?

05:41.080 --> 05:44.298
Gee, I can't remember.

05:47.585 --> 05:49.003
Are you trying to bribe me?

05:50.055 --> 05:51.505
I don't know what
you're talking about.

05:51.507 --> 05:52.606
Take it.

05:52.608 --> 05:53.691
Triangle!

05:54.793 --> 05:55.959
Next!

05:59.315 --> 06:02.149
Wow, you're a natural...
Dad.

06:02.984 --> 06:04.485
You know, I love Robin.

06:04.487 --> 06:06.170
And her sister's okay, I guess.

06:06.172 --> 06:09.657
But there's something nice
about finally having...

06:09.659 --> 06:10.858
a son.

06:10.860 --> 06:12.660
A s...

06:13.478 --> 06:15.312
I...

06:15.314 --> 06:16.514
Cristalli twins, nine o'clock!

06:19.585 --> 06:21.651
Now make like your mommy's
ovum and split!

06:22.655 --> 06:25.039
Solid biology joke, B-dawg.

06:25.041 --> 06:26.373
Woof, woof!

06:27.460 --> 06:28.759
<i>Now, I'll admit,</i>

06:28.761 --> 06:29.793
<i>to the untrained eye,</i>

06:29.795 --> 06:31.178
<i>a few of my packing rulings</i>

06:31.180 --> 06:32.262
<i>may have seemed arbitrary.</i>

06:32.264 --> 06:35.015
<i>Let's Go Italy?</i> Triangle.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.000
Triangle...

06:37.002 --> 06:38.168
let's go Italy.

06:39.471 --> 06:42.639
A gorilla suit and a blonde wig.

06:42.641 --> 06:44.558
Have you used either of these
in the last year?

06:48.898 --> 06:50.731
Please, Queen Kong...

06:50.733 --> 06:52.349
be gentle.

06:54.570 --> 06:55.953
Nope, haven't used those.

06:55.955 --> 06:57.435
I don't think those
even belong to us.

06:58.573 --> 07:00.407
Okay, here's an easy one.

07:00.409 --> 07:03.961
A leaky, ten-year-old
beanbag chair

07:03.963 --> 07:06.130
covered in beer, bong water

07:06.132 --> 07:09.583
and fossilized Cool Ranch
Dorito fingerprints.

07:09.585 --> 07:10.634
Italy.

07:10.636 --> 07:13.003
Vieni ancora per Fudge Grande?

07:13.005 --> 07:15.556
Guys, this chair
has been here forever.

07:15.558 --> 07:16.840
You gotta take it with you.

07:16.842 --> 07:18.425
- Italy.
- Ted...

07:18.427 --> 07:20.710
Italy doesn't need something
that is wrinkled,

07:20.712 --> 07:22.229
red and leaky,

07:22.231 --> 07:24.598
and smells like booze
and narcotics.

07:24.600 --> 07:27.401
They've already got former Prime
Minister Silvio Berlusconi.

07:28.687 --> 07:30.237
I don't know who that is.

07:30.239 --> 07:32.689
All rulings are final.

07:32.691 --> 07:35.993
Okay, why are things that
we like getting "Triangled"

07:35.995 --> 07:38.729
and crap you like sneaks through?
Like what?

07:38.731 --> 07:40.998
That old 50-pound
karaoke machine.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.082
Come on!

07:42.084 --> 07:43.700
We sang in the New Year in '02

07:43.702 --> 07:44.868
on this thing, remember?

07:44.870 --> 07:46.787
We were Destiny's Child!

07:49.257 --> 07:50.507
And since I was Beyonce ,

07:50.509 --> 07:52.576
I'm pretty sure
I get final say here, so...

07:52.578 --> 07:54.711
Oh, we were not your
backup singers, bitch,

07:54.713 --> 07:55.879
we were a group.

07:55.881 --> 07:58.382
I'm sorry, are you guys
married to Jay-Z,

07:58.384 --> 08:00.467
or am I married to Jay-Z?

08:01.136 --> 08:02.386
Italy.

08:04.723 --> 08:06.723
Wow.

08:06.725 --> 08:08.809
The way you used that kid
having an asthma attack

08:08.811 --> 08:09.810
as a human shield?

08:09.812 --> 08:11.478
That took my breath away.

08:11.480 --> 08:13.263
Yeah.
Okay, next,

08:13.265 --> 08:14.982
I'll be point guy
and you lay down cover.

08:14.984 --> 08:16.433
So I'm...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

08:16.435 --> 08:18.435
are you suggesting that
I will not be point guy?

08:19.455 --> 08:21.121
Look,
if Michael Jordan's healthy,

08:21.123 --> 08:23.373
you don't let Scottie Pippen
run the offense.

08:24.242 --> 08:26.443
Oh, you're from Canada, right.

08:26.445 --> 08:28.045
If... how do I put this?

08:28.047 --> 08:30.581
If Wayne Gretzky's healthy,
you don't let...

08:30.583 --> 08:32.082
uh...

08:32.083 --> 08:33.616
François...

08:33.619 --> 08:37.971
What I'm saying is: hockey
is stupid and I'm point guy.

08:37.972 --> 08:40.256
Well, I'm point guy
or I'm off the team.

08:40.259 --> 08:43.177
Gah! You are the most stubborn
human being I have ever met!

08:43.179 --> 08:44.227
You better get used to it...

08:44.230 --> 08:45.430
you're marrying a Scherbatsky.

08:45.431 --> 08:47.981
Your daughter is not
even a fraction

08:47.983 --> 08:52.135
as obstinate, stubborn
and... insane as you are!

08:52.137 --> 08:55.606
Where are you,
you son of a bitch?!

08:56.474 --> 08:58.075
Look away, kids,
she's about to pee.

08:58.077 --> 08:59.026
What...?

08:59.028 --> 09:00.611
I am not some animal.

09:00.613 --> 09:02.246
I peed 20 minutes ago

09:02.248 --> 09:04.581
and I buried it neatly
because I am a lady!

09:09.413 --> 09:12.452
Ted, we haven't used this chair
in the last year.

09:12.453 --> 09:14.920
Ergo, Triangle.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.672
Yeah, I guess I see your point.

09:16.674 --> 09:19.341
I mean, if you haven't used it
in the last year...

09:19.343 --> 09:20.793
Oh!

09:20.795 --> 09:21.760
Using it!

09:21.762 --> 09:22.761
Italy!

09:22.763 --> 09:24.096
Triangle!

09:24.098 --> 09:25.631
Italy.

09:25.633 --> 09:26.915
Triangle!
Triangle!

09:26.917 --> 09:27.916
Italy.

09:27.918 --> 09:28.917
Okay, stop!

09:28.919 --> 09:30.019
Every time he lands,

09:30.021 --> 09:32.271
that chair farts out
ten-year-old Dorito dust.

09:32.273 --> 09:34.490
Yeah, it's the chair.

09:34.492 --> 09:37.443
Guys, trust me: you're gonna
want this chair in Italy.

09:37.445 --> 09:39.945
I... it'll feel like home.

09:40.797 --> 09:41.864
All right, buddy.

09:41.866 --> 09:44.316
You win. Italy.

09:44.318 --> 09:46.035
Really?
Yeah.

09:46.037 --> 09:47.619
We asked you to be
the judge here

09:47.621 --> 09:49.621
and we gotta trust your opinion.

09:49.623 --> 09:50.606
She's right.

09:50.608 --> 09:51.940
And with all the traveling

09:51.942 --> 09:53.242
that we'll be doing...

09:53.244 --> 09:55.377
we could probably use
a couple of your...

09:55.379 --> 09:57.329
hands-free belt satchels.

09:58.214 --> 09:59.614
You said they were lame.

09:59.616 --> 10:01.166
I hate to admit it,

10:01.168 --> 10:04.119
but they actually sound useful.

10:04.121 --> 10:06.555
Could you buy us a couple?

10:07.507 --> 10:10.142
Two hands-free belt satchels,
coming right up.

10:10.144 --> 10:12.261
Oh, and don't worry,
I'll get cool colors

10:12.263 --> 10:13.679
so you guys don't look like

10:13.681 --> 10:16.265
whatever the Spanish term really
is for "Fanny Pack Dork."

10:22.439 --> 10:26.992
Men, it's us... versus them.

10:28.194 --> 10:30.696
Our actions here today

10:30.698 --> 10:32.614
will echo through eternity...

10:32.616 --> 10:34.500
Stand up straight, Kaden!

10:35.485 --> 10:38.820
I only have one rule,
you worthless maggots:

10:39.422 --> 10:41.790
We all respect each other.

10:42.842 --> 10:43.842
I only have one rule:

10:43.844 --> 10:46.178
For every three tens you bang,

10:46.180 --> 10:47.763
throw a bone to a five.

10:47.765 --> 10:50.082
They're grateful and
hard-working and let's face it,

10:50.084 --> 10:51.700
sometimes you just want
to lay there.

10:51.702 --> 10:53.852
What's that got to do
with Laser Tag?

10:57.006 --> 11:00.192
Everything!

11:00.194 --> 11:01.393
...and we will prevail,

11:01.395 --> 11:03.562
even if it takes all night!

11:04.280 --> 11:05.147
Tanner.

11:05.149 --> 11:07.199
I have to be home by 4:00.

11:10.687 --> 11:13.038
Anyone else have
any scheduling issues?

11:13.040 --> 11:14.923
You can take down anyone
on their team...

11:14.925 --> 11:17.409
but I want the big man
for myself.

11:17.411 --> 11:19.661
What's your beef with oldie?

11:19.663 --> 11:22.047
He's...

11:22.049 --> 11:23.215
my father.

11:23.217 --> 11:24.216
Father-in-law.

11:24.218 --> 11:25.534
Shut up, Kai.

11:30.590 --> 11:32.641
Wait a second...

11:32.643 --> 11:35.260
We get it, you pack
a lot in your fanny.

11:35.262 --> 11:37.896
Obvious yet delightful.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.431
Oh, no!

11:44.737 --> 11:47.906
No!

11:49.225 --> 11:51.360
<i>El Ganso!</i>
<i>El Ganso!</i>

11:51.362 --> 11:52.578
Liars!

11:52.580 --> 11:54.196
You sent me on a fool's errand.

11:54.198 --> 11:55.531
Okay, to be fair,

11:55.533 --> 11:58.233
buying a fanny pack is
inherently a fool's errand.

11:58.235 --> 12:00.369
Hands-free belt satchels.

12:00.371 --> 12:02.704
And just for that,
I will not move from this chair

12:02.706 --> 12:04.006
until you agree to keep it!

12:04.008 --> 12:05.791
Ted, unlike that chair,

12:05.793 --> 12:08.093
you, sir, are full of beans.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.744
You have a job interview
in half an hour.

12:11.747 --> 12:12.714
Screw the interview.

12:12.716 --> 12:13.799
I'm staying.

12:13.801 --> 12:18.270
And because the forecast
calls for rain...

12:18.272 --> 12:20.389
This... is a raincoat.

12:22.000 --> 12:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:29.282 --> 12:31.116
Go for Barney.

12:31.118 --> 12:33.485
Hey. Um...

12:33.487 --> 12:34.786
I'm having an issue.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.071
Now, listen, Robin...

12:36.073 --> 12:38.073
is this urgent or can we talk
about it later?

12:39.392 --> 12:40.909
Nah, it's stupid.

12:40.911 --> 12:43.495
Have fun.

12:45.382 --> 12:46.999
So long, losers!

12:50.053 --> 12:51.003
Um...

12:51.005 --> 12:52.921
Look, can you guys
help me down?

12:52.923 --> 12:54.590
I... um...

12:54.592 --> 12:57.092
Ted, if this chair really
means that much to you,

12:57.094 --> 12:58.894
why don't you just
take it for yourself?

12:58.896 --> 13:01.463
No, it's important
that you keep it.

13:01.465 --> 13:02.564
Why?

13:02.566 --> 13:04.466
This is the first thing
we bought

13:04.468 --> 13:05.901
when we moved here
after college.

13:05.903 --> 13:09.271
<i>It was the only piece of</i>
<i>furniture we had for a week.</i>

13:09.273 --> 13:10.656
<i>And now you two are</i>

13:10.658 --> 13:12.157
moving to Italy.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.442
What if our friendship
doesn't pass

13:13.444 --> 13:15.777
the "Have you used it in a yea""
test?

13:15.779 --> 13:18.697
If you can throw
out this chair...

13:18.699 --> 13:21.416
who's to say you can't
throw me out, too?

13:21.418 --> 13:22.918
That could never happen.

13:22.920 --> 13:25.003
You're not a chair,
you're our best friend.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.873
You can say that,
but a lot can change in a year.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.658
Buddy, I...

13:29.660 --> 13:30.926
Look, I know I'm being crazy.

13:30.928 --> 13:33.512
I just...

13:33.514 --> 13:36.098
I just need a moment
with this chair.

13:36.100 --> 13:38.217
You know... to say good-bye.

13:38.219 --> 13:40.886
We'll give you two
some space.

13:43.690 --> 13:47.609
<i>Kids, you can't cling</i>
<i>to the past.</i>

13:53.616 --> 13:57.903
<i>Because no matter how tightly</i>
<i>you hold on...</i>

13:58.854 --> 14:01.423
<i>...it's already gone.</i>

14:05.912 --> 14:06.912
Hello?

14:06.914 --> 14:08.130
Hi.

14:08.132 --> 14:11.333
I'm at the Central Park Carousel
and, um...

14:11.335 --> 14:13.719
I'm having a little bit
of an issue.

14:13.721 --> 14:15.203
Uh, what kind of issue?

14:15.205 --> 14:18.090
Actually, it's a long story...

14:18.092 --> 14:20.092
Um, Robin, listen,
I'm-I'm late for a big meeting.

14:20.094 --> 14:21.226
Is it important?

14:22.545 --> 14:24.680
Nah, it's stupid.

14:24.682 --> 14:26.381
Good luck.

14:27.517 --> 14:29.651
All right, here's
the bottom line, cockroaches.

14:29.653 --> 14:31.403
There's no end in sight

14:31.405 --> 14:34.256
and we've got no provisions.

14:34.258 --> 14:35.407
If it comes down to it,

14:35.409 --> 14:38.827
I need a volunteer to let
the rest of us...

14:38.829 --> 14:39.861
eat him.

14:39.863 --> 14:41.896
Barney's team seems
way more fun.

14:41.898 --> 14:42.731
Nonsense.

14:42.733 --> 14:44.299
Candy for everyone!

14:45.536 --> 14:47.919
Okay, Team Animal House...
who wants to try a cigar?

14:47.921 --> 14:49.421
Yeah!
Yay!

14:49.423 --> 14:51.673
I'm not saying we're gonna start
with your face or anything,

14:51.675 --> 14:53.175
but is there seriously
no one here

14:53.177 --> 14:55.294
willing to give up
a hand or a foot?

14:55.296 --> 14:56.628
We're outta here!

15:17.831 --> 15:19.856
Ted, why are you here?

15:19.857 --> 15:21.941
You had that meeting;
I told you not to come.

15:21.943 --> 15:23.776
You said, "Nah, it's stupid,"

15:23.778 --> 15:26.528
which is Robin-ese for,
"It's important."

15:26.530 --> 15:28.113
Everyone knows that.

15:30.149 --> 15:32.668
Well... not everyone.

15:33.703 --> 15:35.287
But you shouldn't have
skipped that meeting.

15:35.289 --> 15:36.488
Was it important?

15:36.490 --> 15:39.124
Nah, it's stupid.

15:40.010 --> 15:42.544
And yet, my future husband--

15:42.546 --> 15:45.330
who I sometimes fear
is troublingly similar

15:45.332 --> 15:48.183
to my emotionally
unavailable father--

15:48.185 --> 15:51.220
is off shooting laser guns
with, oh, yeah, you guessed it:

15:51.222 --> 15:53.355
my emotionally
unavailable father.

15:53.357 --> 15:54.723
Oh, come on, that's not fair.

15:54.725 --> 15:56.308
If you told Barney
that you needed him,

15:56.310 --> 15:57.526
he'd be here in a heartbeat.

15:57.528 --> 15:59.778
I didn't have to tell you.

15:59.780 --> 16:02.014
And you're here.

16:02.983 --> 16:04.850
You don't even know why.

16:06.853 --> 16:09.989
Seems like I'm here to dig.

16:22.035 --> 16:24.586
Looking for "D"s?

16:25.755 --> 16:28.707
Long story short,
I promised my future self

16:28.709 --> 16:31.543
the locket would be my
"something old" at my wedding.

16:32.812 --> 16:33.929
What?

16:34.564 --> 16:36.065
No, I just like that there was

16:36.067 --> 16:37.382
ever a version of you

16:37.384 --> 16:40.019
who imagined having a
"something old" at your wedding.

16:40.937 --> 16:43.322
Robin Scherbatsky--
you're a girl.

16:43.324 --> 16:44.556
Shut up. <i>You're</i> a girl.

16:44.558 --> 16:45.774
That's been established.

16:45.776 --> 16:48.694
The new information here
is that <i>you're</i> a girl.

16:51.081 --> 16:53.165
Wait... is that...?

16:53.167 --> 16:55.367
Oh, my God, I found it.

16:58.505 --> 17:00.422
Okay...

17:00.424 --> 17:02.407
what's really going on
with this locket?

17:04.962 --> 17:06.428
I'm gonna admit something
that I couldn't admit

17:06.430 --> 17:07.796
until I found this.

17:09.098 --> 17:11.834
I've been having fears
about marrying Barney.

17:12.919 --> 17:14.303
I mean, in many ways,

17:14.305 --> 17:17.356
he's-he's grown up
into a mature, caring adult...

17:17.358 --> 17:20.192
I'm gonna shoot you
with your own gun.

17:22.696 --> 17:25.230
...but I still don't know
if he's ready for this.

17:26.316 --> 17:28.734
I still don't know if I am.

17:29.602 --> 17:31.787
But if I could find
this locket--

17:31.789 --> 17:34.439
if it was still here,
waiting for me--

17:34.441 --> 17:36.291
that would mean
that the Universe

17:36.293 --> 17:37.793
wanted me to marry Barney.

17:37.795 --> 17:39.912
And that everything
was gonna be okay.

17:41.247 --> 17:43.882
And when it was gone,
it was like...

17:43.884 --> 17:47.553
every dot I-I ever had
about Barney,

17:47.555 --> 17:50.422
about myself, got dug up.

17:51.424 --> 17:53.092
But I found it.

17:54.177 --> 17:55.978
And everything's gonna be okay.

17:58.765 --> 18:00.899
Any last words?

18:00.901 --> 18:02.851
You know, seeing you
on the field of battle--

18:02.853 --> 18:06.105
ruthless, manipulative,
untrustworthy--

18:06.107 --> 18:09.241
you've got all the qualities
I would've wanted in a son.

18:10.643 --> 18:12.111
Now I say to you

18:12.113 --> 18:14.279
the last words
my father said to me:

18:14.281 --> 18:16.498
"Shoot me already."

18:17.333 --> 18:20.986
Or we could keep playing,
if you want.

18:20.988 --> 18:23.839
Nah, it's stupid.

18:24.624 --> 18:27.159
Okay, Team Animal House,
I got him!

18:27.161 --> 18:28.293
Come on out!

18:28.295 --> 18:29.545
You're point guy, R-dawg.

18:29.547 --> 18:31.880
Woof, woof.

18:54.038 --> 18:56.354
Oh, thank God.

19:08.601 --> 19:09.968
This is a sign
from the Universe.

19:09.970 --> 19:11.386
It's not a sign
from the Universe...

19:11.388 --> 19:12.387
Yes, it is!

19:12.389 --> 19:13.922
The-the locket is just gone

19:13.924 --> 19:15.974
and you're telling me
that doesn't mean anything?

19:15.976 --> 19:19.595
You know this is a bad omen,
Ted-- you're Universe Guy!

19:19.597 --> 19:20.929
And you're Skeptic Girl!

19:20.931 --> 19:22.314
You're-you're not supposed
to believe any of that.

19:22.316 --> 19:25.217
Well, maybe I've grown skeptical
of being skeptical.

19:26.019 --> 19:28.053
This is a sign.

19:28.055 --> 19:29.188
Look, it's not a sign.

19:29.190 --> 19:31.406
You're doing the right thing
marrying Barney.

19:31.408 --> 19:34.109
The Universe isn't
sending you some message.

19:37.330 --> 19:38.897
As we know from science,

19:38.899 --> 19:42.701
rain is liquid water
in the form of droplets

19:42.703 --> 19:45.070
which have condensed
from atmospheric vapor

19:45.072 --> 19:46.404
and then precipitated.

19:46.406 --> 19:47.339
It's not a sign.

19:47.341 --> 19:50.575
Ted, this is a sign
and you know it.

19:50.577 --> 19:54.179
I mean, the Universe is
screaming at me right now!

19:54.181 --> 19:55.881
How-how-how can you,
of all people,

19:55.883 --> 19:57.549
tell me to ignore that?

19:57.551 --> 20:01.086
Because maybe it's dumb to look
for "signs from the Universe."

20:01.088 --> 20:03.939
I mean, maybe the Universe
has better things to do.

20:03.941 --> 20:05.691
Dear God, I hope it does.

20:05.693 --> 20:07.425
Do you know how many
"signs" I've gotten

20:07.427 --> 20:09.528
that I should or shouldn't
be with someone?

20:09.530 --> 20:11.446
And where has it gotten me?

20:12.565 --> 20:13.982
Maybe there aren't any signs.

20:13.984 --> 20:16.902
Maybe... maybe a locket's
just a locket,

20:16.904 --> 20:19.488
a chair is just a chair.

20:19.490 --> 20:20.739
Maybe we don't have to

20:20.741 --> 20:24.126
give meaning
to every little thing.

20:24.128 --> 20:26.295
Maybe we don't...

20:26.297 --> 20:28.213
maybe we don't need the Universe

20:28.215 --> 20:30.615
to tell us what we really want.

20:30.617 --> 20:34.169
Maybe we already know that,
deep down.

20:34.171 --> 20:37.422
♪ Sharpen them with lies

20:41.010 --> 20:46.815
