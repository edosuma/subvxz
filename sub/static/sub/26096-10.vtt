<i>Growing up in this city,</i>
<i>on the streets of Old Town,</i>

00:13.680 --> 00:15.974
<i>I saw the worst mankind had to offer.</i>

00:16.057 --> 00:18.018
<i>Chaos. Disorder.</i>

00:18.977 --> 00:23.064
<i>I vowed to make it all change.</i>
<i>To make it all better.</i>

00:23.690 --> 00:28.695

00:28.778 --> 00:30.530
<i>It was all leading to this day.</i>

00:30.613 --> 00:33.199
Order has finally been established
in Charter City.

00:33.283 --> 00:36.619
No child will have to fear
for their safety again.

00:36.953 --> 00:39.289
The people owe you the greatest of debts,
Number One,

00:39.539 --> 00:41.958
for liberating them
from the chaos of their lives.

00:42.041 --> 00:43.585
This is the control and security

00:43.668 --> 00:46.463
we have sacrificed our identities
to create.

00:46.546 --> 00:50.717
Our hold might be tenuous
but soon, all of this will be permanent.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.177
[bell rings]

00:57.140 --> 00:59.225
Guys, wake up or something.

00:59.309 --> 01:03.146
-Please do not detain us, friend.
-Our duty is to study.

01:03.938 --> 01:08.318
Wrong. You two are superheroes.
Your duty is to stop all this craziness.

01:08.401 --> 01:11.404
Somewhere in your hazy brainwashing,
I know you know that.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.699
Jake, the world doesn't need
the Flex Fighters anymore.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.785
Charter City only needs order.

01:16.868 --> 01:19.412
This conversation
is not the best use of our time.

01:19.579 --> 01:21.790
We risk being late to class.

01:22.832 --> 01:23.833
[sighs]

01:25.210 --> 01:29.923
Am I the only one in the city not affected
by the SmartMark mind-control?

01:30.673 --> 01:33.259
What is going on? Hold it.

01:33.551 --> 01:36.513
No SmartMark zombie would graffiti.
It's against the law.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.598
Is someone reaching out to us?

01:39.474 --> 01:40.558
A message?

01:41.935 --> 01:44.854
Well, at this rate,
what do I have to lose?

01:51.111 --> 01:52.112
[earpiece chirrups]

02:00.870 --> 02:03.581
Stretch Monster's old lair? Huh?

02:04.290 --> 02:05.708
Hmm.

02:07.252 --> 02:10.338

Reynolds,
you left the secret trail of arrows?

02:55.258 --> 02:56.509
Yep, and if you followed it,

02:56.593 --> 02:59.220
that's enough proof for me
you aren't under Tech-Men control either.

02:59.304 --> 03:03.308
Phew. Because for a second,
I was all, eh, but, okay, yeah.

03:03.641 --> 03:06.144
I knew if anyone was still awake,
it'd be the Flex Fighters.

03:06.352 --> 03:07.562
One of the Flex Fighters.

03:07.937 --> 03:10.815
Do you know why it's only us two
when the rest of the city...?

03:13.818 --> 03:14.819
Goop?

03:14.903 --> 03:19.574
Flexarium-derived ceptio-arcide,
to be specific. Exposure makes you immune.

03:19.657 --> 03:22.160
-How do you know that?
-I was searching in the Old Library

03:22.243 --> 03:24.871
for anything I could find
on the Epsilon Society, or the Tech-Men,

03:24.954 --> 03:26.372
when these two old guys came in.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.249
Um, excuse me, sirs.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.710
But if you've found something,
I'd like to help.

03:32.503 --> 03:34.505
It was a paper submitted
to the Epsilon Society

03:34.589 --> 03:35.924
by a young Jonathan Rook.

03:36.007 --> 03:38.176
The Tech-Men used his prototype
to control the city.

03:38.259 --> 03:40.261
The paper outlines how mind-control works.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.597
And how ceptio-arcide
is the only blocking agent.

03:43.473 --> 03:44.515
So you came here?

03:44.682 --> 03:47.268
I found chemical shipment records
and knew what I needed was here.

03:47.685 --> 03:50.313
I made myself immune,
but before I could help anyone else,

03:50.396 --> 03:54.359
that wave hit, and everyone turned,
whether they had a SmartMark or not.

03:54.567 --> 03:57.612
Well, I was certainly exposed
to enough Ceptio-arca-whatsit

03:57.695 --> 03:59.614
when I battled that Living Flexarium Army.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.700
Even more than the other Flex Fighters,
I guess.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.286
But there's only enough
of the chemical left to cure a few people.

04:05.536 --> 04:08.164
Then we just cure the team we need
to take the Tech-Men down.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.624
Do you know where Dr. C and Rook are?

04:09.707 --> 04:11.209
They're mindlessly working in a lab.

04:11.292 --> 04:12.710
Then you need to wake them up.

04:12.794 --> 04:15.838
I know where the other Flex Fighters are,
I'll take care of them.

04:19.342 --> 04:22.220
Riya, er,
Principal Wilson asked to see you.

04:22.428 --> 04:24.639
I always obey authority figures.

04:28.643 --> 04:30.770
Let me apologize in advance.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.063
Agh!

04:32.647 --> 04:34.440
-Yah!
-[grunts]

04:34.607 --> 04:36.776
Hey! I already apologized!

04:37.402 --> 04:40.196
-I am angry!
-I can tell.

04:40.530 --> 04:43.283
I haven't felt anger since...

04:43.366 --> 04:44.367
Aargh!

04:46.786 --> 04:49.205
The Tech-Men.
They took control of my mind.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.958
No one gets to take control of me.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.048
What do we do next?

04:59.465 --> 05:01.884
Are you sure it's okay for us
to open this closet?

05:01.968 --> 05:03.386
I wouldn't want to get in trouble.

05:03.469 --> 05:05.388
The Mayor called
and said you have to look inside.

05:06.848 --> 05:08.266
You've been gooped!

05:08.349 --> 05:11.227
It's in my mouth! Why always the mouth?

05:11.311 --> 05:13.855
Did I just say,
"I didn't like getting in trouble?"

05:13.938 --> 05:15.690
What is wrong with me?

05:16.274 --> 05:18.401
Nothing. Not anymore.

05:24.407 --> 05:28.077
Dr. C, the amount of fulfillment
I receive by working with you

05:28.328 --> 05:29.912
is minimally sufficient.

05:29.996 --> 05:33.249
I feel a similar basic level
of contentment, Jonathan.

05:33.833 --> 05:36.544
Delivery. Number Six says
you should open them immediately.

05:36.627 --> 05:38.588
We are happy to comply.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.341
[mechanical whir]

05:43.342 --> 05:46.763
-What is this?
-I suggest you both come with me.

05:47.263 --> 05:49.057
Are you sure Kane can't find us here?

05:49.140 --> 05:51.309
This old safe house of mine
is off the grid.

05:51.476 --> 05:54.479
That's why I brought their friend here
when we found out how sick she was.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.230
My gear's enabled me to hook her vitals

05:56.314 --> 05:59.442
into our communications grid
to monitor her.

05:59.525 --> 06:03.154
Rook, we need you to produce
more of that Flexarium-variant compound.

06:03.237 --> 06:05.740
We used all of it from the Monster Factory
to wake you guys up.

06:05.948 --> 06:08.284
Sure, making more
would be totally possible.

06:08.367 --> 06:10.369
If you hadn't erased my InfoGem.

06:10.453 --> 06:11.746
Without that...

06:12.371 --> 06:15.333
-There's gotta be a way to make more.
-Not quickly enough.

06:15.416 --> 06:18.753
But there's still a way to save the city.
Right here.

06:19.921 --> 06:20.922
What about Erika?

06:21.547 --> 06:24.967
You all know I was experimenting
in creating powers in humans.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.512
Smokestack, Multi-Farious, Circuit-Stream.

06:27.929 --> 06:31.099
All empowered by chemical variations
of Flexarium.

06:31.390 --> 06:32.391
I don't know how,

06:32.475 --> 06:35.937
but this girl's been exposed
to one of those chemicals I created.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.855
Are you saying she has superpowers now?

06:41.776 --> 06:42.902
What kind of powers?

06:42.985 --> 06:45.530
In theory,
the ability to send out pulses of energy.

06:45.780 --> 06:49.534
Even with her unconscious, we could
encourage her body to accept the powers

06:49.909 --> 06:51.202
and to create an energy pulse

06:51.285 --> 06:53.704
that would burn out
the Tech-Men's mind-control for good.

06:53.788 --> 06:56.040
-Save everyone.
-But?

06:56.290 --> 07:00.837
But it's risky. She might not survive.

07:00.920 --> 07:01.963
Then no.

07:02.213 --> 07:05.007
Agreed. She's unconscious.
She can't choose for herself.

07:05.383 --> 07:08.511
Explain to these children
that sacrifices are inevitable.

07:08.594 --> 07:10.012
No. The team is right.

07:11.139 --> 07:12.223
If we force this on her,

07:12.306 --> 07:15.476
we're no better than the Tech-Men,
using people as machines.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.520
You've always been too risk-averse.

07:17.603 --> 07:19.814
My city must be freed,
no matter what the cost--

07:19.897 --> 07:20.898
[metallic clunk]

07:22.984 --> 07:25.153
This isn't your city. It's all of ours.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.822
Message received.

07:28.072 --> 07:29.365
There has to be another way.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.702
Plan B, we sneak into Rook Tower,
destroy Kane's control device,

07:32.785 --> 07:35.329
and beat up all the Tech-Men
before they can set up another one.

07:35.621 --> 07:39.208
You want us to beat up all the Tech-Men?
Like all... Every single one of them?

07:39.292 --> 07:42.879
A simple, but possibly effective plan.
One big problem.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.839
Remember,
the Tech-Men's mind-control device

07:44.922 --> 07:46.924
is based on one of my original designs.

07:47.008 --> 07:48.009
Your point?

07:48.342 --> 07:52.096
Right now, their control over people
is based on continuous transmission.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.557
But in a few hours,
everyone will have been exposed

07:54.640 --> 07:58.144
for so long that the control
will be permanent.

07:58.227 --> 07:59.979
We can't mess this up.

08:00.062 --> 08:04.901
Look, guys, I know this will be hard.
And some of us might not survive.

08:04.984 --> 08:10.281
But if we don't stop Kane, we lose
Charter City forever. Who's with me?

08:15.453 --> 08:16.537
[groans]

08:18.915 --> 08:21.167
Time to take down the Tech-Men.

08:36.682 --> 08:39.602
Sleeping on the job, guys?
Kane will be so mad!

08:39.685 --> 08:42.355
<i>Tech-Men, eliminate the intruders!</i>

08:50.947 --> 08:52.573
They walked right through the front door?

08:52.657 --> 08:55.826
I thought you trained them,
how stupid could they be?

08:55.910 --> 08:57.328
You have no idea.

08:57.411 --> 09:00.164
But it looks like they overcame
the SmartMark's mental controls,

09:00.248 --> 09:03.167
which means they must be working
with someone else.

09:04.627 --> 09:07.296
Send a battalion
to search every inch of this tower, now!

09:07.380 --> 09:08.464
What for, sir?

09:08.714 --> 09:10.550
If I know anything
about the Flex Fighters,

09:10.633 --> 09:12.134
this fight is just a distraction,

09:12.218 --> 09:15.179
and the real danger
is hiding somewhere inside this building.

09:16.013 --> 09:17.223
[chirrups]

09:21.394 --> 09:23.354
I thought Kane found
all your secret tunnels.

09:23.688 --> 09:26.566
Not all. Kane's smart,
but guess who's smarter?

09:26.649 --> 09:27.692
We have to hurry.

09:27.775 --> 09:30.653
The Flex Fighters won't be able to keep
the attention on themselves for long.

09:30.736 --> 09:33.990
I think you underestimate
just how obnoxious they can be.

09:34.073 --> 09:37.076
Let's just focus on getting upstairs
to shut that machine down

09:37.159 --> 09:39.537
before Kane's control
hits a hundred percent.

09:40.913 --> 09:41.914

09:43.791 --> 09:47.628

<i>I'm guessing Omni-Mass named this move.</i>

10:00.766 --> 10:04.395
Is it me, or are we literally
and figuratively kicking their butts?

10:04.478 --> 10:07.607
Oh, yeah, we're finally working
like the team Kane wanted us to be,

10:07.690 --> 10:10.943
- to take him down.
- Irony.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.154

We can't help them,
we're only getting one shot

10:42.725 --> 10:45.186
at shutting Kane's machine down. Come on.

Well done, my Tech-Men.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.888
This stops now.

Keep firing!

11:47.915 --> 11:49.834
I am never talking back to her again!

that's the Flex Fighters screaming.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.300
You are coming with us.

The Tech-Men, the former Epsilon Society
you so boldly rejected

is moments away from complete control
over your beloved city.

Erika, that's it.

13:11.624 --> 13:15.544
Dude, have you cracked?
She's not only not here, she's in a coma!

13:15.794 --> 13:19.131
But we could reach her. Her coma state,
it's just like a dream state, right?

13:19.673 --> 13:21.509
Now this is my kind of crazy talk.

13:21.926 --> 13:25.179
Blindstrike, do you still have any of that
knockout gas in your armor somewhere?

13:25.387 --> 13:28.098
A little bit. But I don't know
how you'd replicate Dr. C's actions

13:28.182 --> 13:29.517
that put us in the dreamscape.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.644
Erika is hooked up to our comms.

13:31.727 --> 13:34.897
If I can pulse my goggles the moment
you hit me with the gas,

13:34.980 --> 13:36.524
it's the only chance we have.

13:38.275 --> 13:39.610
[metallic clunk]

13:39.693 --> 13:40.945
[coughs]

13:41.820 --> 13:46.158
No! It didn't work!
Now what are we... gonna... do?

13:59.380 --> 14:00.923
Oh, hey, er, Jake.

14:01.131 --> 14:03.509
Weird. I didn't expect to see you here.

14:04.260 --> 14:07.012
I didn't exactly expect to be here.

14:07.096 --> 14:11.934
Um, this is kind of awkward,
and I don't know how to say it but...

14:12.184 --> 14:14.603
I need to ask you to save the city.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.397
Save the city? How?

14:16.647 --> 14:19.775
The serum that put you into this place,
it could give you powers,

14:19.859 --> 14:21.986
if you were to let your body accept them.

14:22.319 --> 14:25.030
I've seen what having superpowers
has done to all of you.

14:25.114 --> 14:27.992
You're always hiding,
always fighting some monster.

14:28.075 --> 14:31.370
If you had a choice,
if you had to do it over again,

14:31.453 --> 14:33.080
would you accept your powers?

14:33.163 --> 14:35.791
Until I had these powers,
I was just a busy kid,

14:35.875 --> 14:37.960
going from one activity to the next.

14:38.043 --> 14:40.212
I thought that's what I was supposed
to be doing.

14:40.296 --> 14:44.550
But now I realize, this,
this is what I'm supposed to be doing.

14:44.967 --> 14:48.470
But if you choose to accept your powers,
it's risky.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.598
We don't exactly know what'll happen
if you do this.

14:50.681 --> 14:53.809
So there's a chance this idea
won't work at all?

14:53.893 --> 14:55.686
And what would happen to me?

14:55.895 --> 14:58.147
I... I don't know.

15:04.653 --> 15:05.654
Stretch?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.490
You should be pleased, Dr. Cleo.

15:09.199 --> 15:13.287
You wanted Rook taken down,
and that's what I've done.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.499
This is all kinds of bad.

15:18.709 --> 15:19.710
[chirrups]

15:30.095 --> 15:31.096
[muffled grunt]

15:34.516 --> 15:35.559
[groans]

15:36.060 --> 15:40.356
-Stretch, what happened?
-We are about to see something epic.

15:44.276 --> 15:45.277
[grunts]

15:58.457 --> 15:59.458
[loud whoosh]

16:08.550 --> 16:09.718
[all groan]

16:11.470 --> 16:12.805
[groans]

16:17.851 --> 16:19.144
What is that?

16:26.568 --> 16:29.488
-Six, what is that thing?
-I don't know, but whatever it is,

16:29.571 --> 16:32.491
it's wiping out the SmartMark controls,
obliterating it.

16:32.574 --> 16:35.786
We have no chance.
This is a Situation Zeta.

16:36.286 --> 16:37.413
She did it.

16:37.705 --> 16:41.000
All Tech-Men, Order Zeta.
Repeat, Order Zeta.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.668
This is not over.

16:43.752 --> 16:46.839
With all due respect, sir,
we must cut our losses.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.466
Grrr...

17:06.150 --> 17:10.320
This is Number One. I repeal the Order
Zeta, I repeat, repeal the... Hmm?

17:12.406 --> 17:14.533
Repeal this. Boss.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.452
[groans]

17:27.087 --> 17:28.338
Oh, no, Erika!

17:37.056 --> 17:41.060
[gasps] Nathan?
Wow, this has been a weird day.

17:44.271 --> 17:45.272
[chirrups]

17:53.739 --> 17:57.785
Jonathan, we fulfilled our part.
Time for you to fulfill yours.

17:57.868 --> 18:01.830
I'm releasing the video to the world.
It's time they know the truth.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.499
Hate to be the bearer of bad news,

18:03.582 --> 18:07.419
but I erased all traces of that video
back in your mobile lab.

18:07.503 --> 18:12.758
I've got my city back, my company back.
And you are not going to stop me.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.094
I expected you would try something
like this.

18:15.177 --> 18:19.598
If you won't willingly show that video,
we'll force you to confess, live.

18:19.681 --> 18:20.682
[beeps]

18:22.851 --> 18:23.852
[chuckles]

18:24.311 --> 18:29.108
I prepare for everything, Racine.
You should know that by now.

18:29.191 --> 18:30.192
[beeps]

18:44.164 --> 18:45.165
[beeps]

18:53.257 --> 18:56.927
You won't be able to hide
from me this time.

18:59.513 --> 19:01.849
Whatever that gas was,
she's not waking up.

19:02.224 --> 19:05.769
We'll find a way to get her back.
And stop Rook together, for good.

19:23.370 --> 19:25.289
Whoa. The Parks?

19:25.497 --> 19:28.125
What's going on here?
I'm in trouble, aren't I?

19:28.417 --> 19:31.003
No, son. Look, we know the idea of moving

19:31.086 --> 19:32.921
has been harder on you
this time than usual.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.631
You've finally found some friends here.

19:34.715 --> 19:37.050
So we sort of made a deal.

19:37.426 --> 19:41.138
Any interest in living with Nathan
and us for the rest of the school year?

19:42.097 --> 19:44.141
Well, all right!

19:52.608 --> 19:56.320
Hey. How, er, are you?

19:56.570 --> 20:02.201
I thought I drained all the energy
I had in my blast but, well...

20:18.300 --> 20:19.468
So...

20:20.219 --> 20:21.220
So...

20:21.511 --> 20:23.680
It's funny now. I used to sit in the quad

20:23.764 --> 20:26.808
and make up all these stories in my head
about what you were really like.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.685
-Boy, was I wrong.
-[laughs]

20:28.769 --> 20:31.605
I thought you were boring and lame
and always played by the rules.

20:31.688 --> 20:34.566
So, I guess, nothing is what we expected.

20:34.942 --> 20:38.237
No. But I realize now,
despite all the danger...

20:38.612 --> 20:42.115
that I would not wanna have it
any other way.

20:54.419 --> 20:57.881
Well, all of that must have been
a truly frightening experience.

20:58.131 --> 21:00.008
I won't lie, it was.

21:00.092 --> 21:04.554
The Flex Fighters, when they betrayed me,
gave all of our secrets to the Tech-Men,

21:04.638 --> 21:06.306
giving them a chance
to take over the city.

21:06.598 --> 21:09.184
But with the help of Officer Reynolds,
my new Head of Security,

21:09.393 --> 21:12.980
he and I were able
to single-handedly defeat them.

21:13.063 --> 21:14.064
[squeaks open]

21:17.276 --> 21:18.402
Meow!

21:20.696 --> 21:22.114
Evening, Cat.

21:23.073 --> 21:24.992
[muffled grunts]

21:28.495 --> 21:29.496
[squelches]
