No.

Please.

00:30.739 --> 00:31.740
Please.

00:34.492 --> 00:36.202
It's my life's work.

00:37.162 --> 00:40.623
You either sign, or you're sentencing
your family to death back at the ranch.

01:21.456 --> 01:22.290
Sign it.

01:40.141 --> 01:43.812
<i>I feel the warmth from</i>
<i>my boiling blood</i>

01:44.437 --> 01:48.566
<i>I feel the fear, sweat dripping away</i>

01:48.942 --> 01:52.904
<i>There's a stillness</i>
<i>that nothing transmits</i>

01:53.321 --> 01:59.244
<i>I'm a breeze that grows stronger</i>

01:59.911 --> 02:03.248
<i>Even when the clouds drift away</i>

02:04.249 --> 02:07.335
<i>Even when my skin dries away</i>

02:08.378 --> 02:12.090
<i>I'll be back someday</i>

02:13.007 --> 02:17.137
<i>To unleash my return</i>

02:21.641 --> 02:25.436
<i>I have the dust that protects the road</i>

02:26.104 --> 02:30.275
<i>I have the branches of a leafless tree</i>

02:30.525 --> 02:34.487
<i>I'm the guardian of the tired night</i>

02:34.821 --> 02:40.535
<i>There are silhouettes</i>

02:41.411 --> 02:44.747

02:54.424 --> 02:58.720
<i>To unleash my return</i>

03:37.759 --> 03:39.093
Boss, someone's here to see you.

03:46.809 --> 03:47.936
What's up?

03:51.356 --> 03:53.024
What brings you to Acapulco, boss?

03:53.107 --> 03:53.983
Thank you.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.444
Joaquín has an assignment for you.

03:56.527 --> 03:57.862
"LA MUÑECA"
ARTURO BERNAL LEYDA'S LIEUTENANT

03:57.946 --> 03:59.072
Cool, why me?

03:59.239 --> 04:00.823
Because you're from Nuevo Laredo.

04:01.407 --> 04:03.201
Raciel's and the Gulf's turf.

04:04.869 --> 04:06.120
That's precisely why we want you.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.504
Don Joaquín, I'm at your service.

04:15.630 --> 04:18.007
RIVERSIDE ROAD

04:18.091 --> 04:19.926
Do you still have friends
in the Gulf's crew?

04:20.802 --> 04:22.095
A few, Don Joaquín.

04:22.387 --> 04:25.682
Most of the people from my old
neighborhood work for Raciel.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.282
Are these the infamous Emes?

04:45.076 --> 04:46.327
The strong arm of the Gulf.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.163
Trained by the Gringos and the Israelites.

04:51.582 --> 04:53.126
"EME 16"
CANO'S LIEUTENANT

04:53.209 --> 04:55.628
Follow us, the boss is waiting.

05:03.344 --> 05:05.305
<i>They answer directly to Cano.</i>

05:07.890 --> 05:10.184
<i>They're Elite Military, just like him.</i>

05:33.249 --> 05:34.667
What can we do for you?

05:37.628 --> 05:39.422
I wanna run some blow to Chicago.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.966
And I'd like to run it through your turf.

05:42.592 --> 05:45.219
I thought you wouldn't want any
more business with us.

05:45.344 --> 05:47.638
Because you declined
to join the Federation?

05:48.765 --> 05:50.016
Business is business, Raciel.

05:50.975 --> 05:52.185
You have your reasons.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.313
What happened to your tunnels?

05:55.855 --> 05:57.106
Still in place.

05:58.107 --> 05:59.901
But going to Chicago
is not feasible from here.

06:02.695 --> 06:03.905
What do you think, bro?

06:04.197 --> 06:07.158
"TONY TEMPEST"
GULF'S SECOND IN COMMAND

06:07.617 --> 06:09.786
You could run 10 tons a month, max.

06:10.745 --> 06:12.872
We'll provide deposits
and customs liaisons.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.333
You take care of the men and the trucks.

06:15.917 --> 06:17.668
We keep 10 percent of the profit.

06:22.006 --> 06:24.175
The Federation has an exclusive
deal with the DEA.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.469
Your customs liaison is not needed.

06:27.011 --> 06:29.555
Just your deposits will do.
And we'll give you seven.

06:34.852 --> 06:37.396
That works. Seven percent.

06:38.397 --> 06:40.900
Muñeca will oversee this entire operation.

07:01.295 --> 07:03.589
Keep your eyes on Chapo's man.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.342
We can't trust the fucker.

07:07.426 --> 07:08.261
Let's go.

07:18.813 --> 07:20.481
I have to take this in private.

07:24.652 --> 07:25.611
Hello.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.155
<i>Hello, Conrado.</i>

07:27.905 --> 07:29.240
<i>I have a gift for you.</i>

07:30.533 --> 07:32.493
Why so generous?

07:32.577 --> 07:34.120
Raciel won't cave.

07:34.871 --> 07:37.290
He's a danger to
the Federation's stability.

07:37.373 --> 07:40.501
I'll get him for you,
but I get to keep Nuevo Laredo.

08:30.551 --> 08:32.470
<i>We're preparing the first shipment.</i>

08:33.429 --> 08:35.181
The rest will be more complicated.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.308
We're being watched.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.311
You're in. That was the hard part.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.939
Notify me when you have something.

08:43.022 --> 08:44.106
Yes, sir.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.848
This is as far as you go, fucker!

09:25.398 --> 09:27.400
You shit your pants, Muñeca!

09:29.110 --> 09:31.696

-That's it!

I never forgave you for stealing my girl.

Shit! Ruby?

10:04.520 --> 10:05.688
I did you a favor, asshole!

10:06.272 --> 10:08.774
Do me another favor and take my woman now!

10:08.983 --> 10:11.152
What, you have another chubby one?

10:12.820 --> 10:14.905
We're approaching the safe house.

10:15.364 --> 10:16.657
Let's go get our weapons.

10:34.425 --> 10:35.551
Let's go.

10:58.783 --> 11:01.118
Here's the payment for the first shipment.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.593
Don Joaquín says he's grateful
for your support.

11:18.552 --> 11:20.012
Tell him we feel the same.

11:20.596 --> 11:23.099
I'll bring in your part
as we continue to ship out.

11:46.122 --> 11:49.208
ARTURO BERNAL LEYDA'S RESIDENCE
CULIACÁN, MEXICO

11:49.291 --> 11:50.584
Could we have a word?

11:51.460 --> 11:52.878
Do you know what Joaquín is up to?

12:02.263 --> 12:04.223
Listen, you're in charge.

12:05.474 --> 12:07.810
All I'm saying is that the Emes
are just as trained as we are,

12:07.893 --> 12:08.894
if not more so.

12:09.728 --> 12:11.147
Plus they outnumber us two to one.

12:12.273 --> 12:15.443
If we send our <i>sicarios </i>there,
they'll be slaughtered like lambs.

12:19.238 --> 12:21.323
Our advantage is to ambush them.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.325
Yes, but...

12:24.160 --> 12:26.579
our disadvantage is that
it's not our territory.

12:26.662 --> 12:28.747
They're in control there, plus they've
got plenty of reinforcements.

12:31.292 --> 12:32.376
True.

12:33.836 --> 12:36.046
But our people are not quitters.

12:39.508 --> 12:40.718
Or are they?

12:42.136 --> 12:43.387
No, never.

13:06.994 --> 13:08.204
What's that?

13:10.748 --> 13:11.707
It's the Emes.

13:11.790 --> 13:14.668
They burn down the homes of
those who decline to cooperate.

13:14.752 --> 13:15.961
They're fucking nuts.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.548
The band has been
confirmed for Saturday.

13:20.090 --> 13:21.592
You're shitting me!

13:22.259 --> 13:23.385
A party?

13:23.469 --> 13:26.055
At the boss's ranch.
They're something else, man!

13:34.772 --> 13:36.649
We'll kill two birds with one stone.

13:37.441 --> 13:40.402
The Feds and the Army
are going in to get Raciel.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.696
Without a leader...

13:43.155 --> 13:44.990
plus all the commotion at the party...

13:45.282 --> 13:47.952
it will be the perfect moment
to overtake Nuevo Laredo.

13:48.577 --> 13:50.079
What about Tony Tempest?

13:50.955 --> 13:52.206
With his brother captured,

13:52.289 --> 13:54.667
he'll have no other option but to
acquiesce to the Federation.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.633
The Gulf's crew is at one end,
and we're at the other.

14:04.343 --> 14:06.136
Why the fuck are we going after them?

14:07.555 --> 14:09.807
Because those who aren't with us
are against us.

14:09.890 --> 14:11.976
Besides, what we're doing
is called expansion.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.688
The Federation has to be the sole owner

14:15.771 --> 14:17.523
of the business in all of Mexico.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.610
We have to manifest the power
of our alliance.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.070
This is the moment to do so.

14:23.153 --> 14:24.196
Let's do it.

14:25.322 --> 14:26.532
When's the party?

14:35.749 --> 14:38.335
The Federal Squad and the Army

14:38.878 --> 14:40.713

32:26.736 --> 32:29.364
and close a deal to send the drugs
through Juarez.

32:29.948 --> 32:33.159
Tell them about what happened
and that we'll discuss it in person.

32:51.511 --> 32:54.347
I've always said that you're in command.

32:56.099 --> 32:58.768
But, he was nearby.

33:00.603 --> 33:02.188
You too.

33:03.439 --> 33:05.692
It won't be easy to kill those fuckers.

33:25.336 --> 33:28.548
<i>The arrest of Raciel Cardenas</i>
<i>is yet another breakthrough which</i>

33:28.631 --> 33:32.552
<i>the Mexican Government can claim</i>
<i>against drug trafficking.</i>

33:32.635 --> 33:36.973
<i>Without its leader, the Gulf Cartel has</i>
<i>now been left severely debilitated.</i>

33:37.598 --> 33:39.183
<i>More incidents have been...</i>

33:39.267 --> 33:41.853
We broke free from the tiger,
but the lion has awakened.

33:41.978 --> 33:44.522
<i>...as consequences with confrontations</i>
<i>between...</i>

33:46.691 --> 33:49.360
Cano has demonstrated
he's a better boss than Raciel.

33:49.610 --> 33:51.654
That fucker reacted quicker
than I had expected.

33:53.906 --> 33:55.199
What are we going to do?

33:56.492 --> 33:57.785
We're at war.

33:57.952 --> 34:00.580
CHAPO GIVE US MORE
COCKSUCKERS TO KILL OFF

34:03.708 --> 34:05.168
And we're gonna win.

34:07.795 --> 34:11.174
ALMOLOYA PENITENTIARY

34:38.534 --> 34:40.870
I told you it was crazy.

34:40.953 --> 34:43.498
We've lost money, weapons, men.

34:46.084 --> 34:49.337
This confrontation made it clear
that Cano and the Emes

34:49.420 --> 34:52.006
are our most dangerous enemies.

34:52.965 --> 34:55.510
-We have to get rid of them.
-No, no, you promised us

34:55.593 --> 34:57.970
that within the Federation
we would work in peace.

34:58.054 --> 35:01.349
Yet, this is gonna drag us into
a war that'll end everyone's business.

35:02.266 --> 35:04.560
You can go on on your own,
leave us out of it.

35:04.977 --> 35:06.979
You don't speak for us all, Rodolfillo.

35:10.733 --> 35:12.235
The Emes...

35:13.069 --> 35:14.195
are true militia.

35:15.905 --> 35:18.866
Unlike you and your fake soldiers
playing war with everyone's money.

35:18.991 --> 35:21.119
-Calm your brother down.
-Rodolfo...

35:22.620 --> 35:24.664
...sit down.

35:32.380 --> 35:35.049
Sorry, he will not interrupt anymore.

35:35.133 --> 35:37.135
If you lack the balls to finish with this,

35:37.468 --> 35:39.053
losses will be losses.

35:39.345 --> 35:42.390
If we finish this, it will be our
greatest investment.

35:45.643 --> 35:47.979
Nuevo Laredo is the bastion of the Gulf.

35:49.105 --> 35:51.274
And we have to take it from them.

35:54.443 --> 35:57.196
For now, we'll need to change
our strategy.

35:58.823 --> 36:01.659
We will isolate them.
There are more of us.

36:02.785 --> 36:05.163
They only have the Michoacan Family.

36:08.124 --> 36:11.419
We'll bring in their partner,
Nazario, to our side.

36:13.087 --> 36:15.381
I refuse to be part
of this fucking bullshit!

36:33.024 --> 36:35.443
Your brother's whinier
than my bitches, man.

36:47.622 --> 36:50.208
Bro, don't get me in any more trouble.

36:51.042 --> 36:53.294
-Apologize, you moron.
-Fuck, no.

36:54.670 --> 36:58.299
That asshole thinks that just 'cause
he broke out of jail he can do anything?

36:59.091 --> 37:03.179
Plus, if it weren't for us, fucking Chapo
wouldn't be sending shit to Chicago.

37:07.642 --> 37:11.103
Listen, at this moment it's not convenient
to be opposing him.

37:13.522 --> 37:15.566
Inside or outside of jail,

37:16.025 --> 37:18.653
El Chapo's more powerful than we are.

37:24.700 --> 37:26.244
Buddy, get me another one.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.542
You?

37:37.255 --> 37:38.297
Yeah.

37:53.562 --> 37:54.772
Jaguar!

37:57.858 --> 37:58.985
Hey...

38:00.278 --> 38:03.447
the things I said were only
to mess with your boss.

38:04.156 --> 38:06.325
I have no quarrel with you guys.

38:06.867 --> 38:07.868
All right?

38:08.577 --> 38:10.204
No problem.

38:28.681 --> 38:30.558
You pay for your boss, fucker!

39:18.105 --> 39:22.026
Jimena? What are you doing? I told you
to stay at home. Come on!

39:22.318 --> 39:23.611
Come on! I told you to stay at home!

39:25.321 --> 39:26.447
Quickly!

39:32.203 --> 39:33.579
What's wrong with you?

39:34.747 --> 39:36.707
I left you a note we'd be here.
Is something wrong?

40:13.035 --> 40:14.412
<i>It's done.</i>

40:21.502 --> 40:23.337
Now the good shit starts.
