00:01.392 --> 00:02.828
[Kara]
Previously onSupergirl...

00:02.872 --> 00:05.048
You think your brother's using
his powers in prison?

00:05.092 --> 00:07.268
They're being forced
to steal against their will.

00:09.357 --> 00:11.141
If you come with me,

00:11.185 --> 00:14.275
I will do everything
in my power to make sure
your voices are heard.

00:14.318 --> 00:16.146
Don't let us down.

00:16.190 --> 00:18.366
[Kelly] The Kelly Olsen
that I know
never gives up.

00:18.409 --> 00:20.672
I wanna be the new Guardian.

00:20.716 --> 00:24.024
[Nyxly] An evil man took
my powers and banished me
to the Phantom Zone.

00:24.067 --> 00:27.288
I couldn't cross
the barrier into your real
world and got trapped.

00:27.331 --> 00:29.377
If you get me out
of this dream realm,

00:29.420 --> 00:31.988
I will have enough power
to bring your mother
back to life.

00:32.032 --> 00:32.858
I'm in.

00:37.733 --> 00:38.821
I'm free.

00:40.257 --> 00:41.084
Oh!

00:42.172 --> 00:43.173
I'm free.

00:44.305 --> 00:46.568
-[sighs]
-All right.

00:46.611 --> 00:50.528
I brought you out of the dream
world just like I promised.

00:50.572 --> 00:53.314
-So where--
-Oh, relax, Naltorian.

00:53.357 --> 00:55.359
I haven't forgotten our deal.

00:55.403 --> 00:58.319
You will have your mother back
for one day as promised,

01:00.321 --> 01:02.627
but this will sap
the last of my power.

01:04.151 --> 01:05.587
Hmm.

01:05.630 --> 01:09.460
Let's get it over with
so I can be about my business.

01:10.287 --> 01:11.723
What business?

01:11.767 --> 01:14.291
I thought you said
you were going straight home.

01:14.335 --> 01:16.119
Oh! [chuckles]

01:16.163 --> 01:20.341
Nearly forgot.
There is one more stipulation.

01:20.384 --> 01:22.386
As long as Mummy is here,

01:22.430 --> 01:25.172
you'll be trapped
inside a magical realm

01:25.215 --> 01:29.045
and no messages can come in
or go out.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.220
No, my friends will worry.

01:30.264 --> 01:32.266
Doubtful. But if anyone does,

01:32.309 --> 01:36.139
my magic will redirect
their thoughts to
more worthwhile concerns.

01:36.183 --> 01:37.575
Wait...

01:37.619 --> 01:38.446
[grunts]

01:41.710 --> 01:42.493
Bollocks!

01:42.537 --> 01:44.843
Where's my mother?

01:44.887 --> 01:47.498
You know, a simple "thank you"
would suffice.

01:51.198 --> 01:52.286
Wait!

01:54.462 --> 01:55.680
[Isabel] Nia.

01:58.944 --> 01:59.945
Mom?

02:06.213 --> 02:07.388
My darling...

02:09.346 --> 02:10.478
what have you done?

02:19.269 --> 02:22.925
I know it was a dangerous deal
to make.

02:22.968 --> 02:25.928
And I know that she wasn't
to be trusted

02:25.971 --> 02:28.191
and that bringing back the dead
probably wasn't the best idea,

02:28.235 --> 02:31.803
but I sensed that she would
keep her end of the bargain,
and she did.

02:33.675 --> 02:35.242
She brought you back to me.

02:36.939 --> 02:38.332
I need you, Mom.

02:38.375 --> 02:42.423
You left so suddenly,
and I don't have any training.

02:42.466 --> 02:44.773
I never left you, Nia.

02:44.816 --> 02:49.169
I was with you, always.
You just haven't
heeded my signs.

02:49.212 --> 02:50.909
Why did you send my owl away?

02:52.259 --> 02:53.303
That was you.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.394
I thought it might be,
but I wasn't...

02:58.352 --> 02:59.222
sure.

02:59.266 --> 03:01.224
See, this is my problem!

03:01.268 --> 03:05.924
I have been trying so hard
to be a hero and to
make you proud,

03:05.968 --> 03:09.232
but I just can't interpret
my powers.

03:09.276 --> 03:14.324
Everything's muddy,
and I'm just guessing blindly!

03:14.368 --> 03:17.632
I knew it was wrong
to let Nyxly out,

03:17.675 --> 03:21.288
but I just figured that
once we were together,

03:21.331 --> 03:23.942
if she caused a problem,
we could fix it.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.207
And we will, right?

03:29.078 --> 03:31.167
Sweetheart...

03:31.211 --> 03:33.387
you've unleashed
a force of hell on Earth.

03:35.432 --> 03:36.694
Then we have to stop her.

03:42.439 --> 03:43.440
No.

03:45.181 --> 03:46.182
No!

03:47.314 --> 03:49.098
There has to be some way
out of here.

03:49.141 --> 03:50.142
Not today.

03:51.405 --> 03:52.754
You made the bargain, Nia.

03:54.146 --> 03:55.235
You called me back.

03:56.323 --> 03:57.411
Let's get to work.

04:01.371 --> 04:03.068
-Hi.
-Hello.

04:03.112 --> 04:05.810
[both] We're your friendly
neighborhood Super Friends.

04:05.854 --> 04:09.423
Wanna know how us superheroes
stay strong and sharp?

04:09.466 --> 04:12.643
We eat our greens.

04:12.687 --> 04:16.343
You see, kids,
I used to eat a lot of donuts.

04:16.386 --> 04:19.259
Mmm! Good, correct?

04:19.302 --> 04:20.651
Incorrect.

04:20.695 --> 04:23.698
I could barely keep up
my strength to fight crime.

04:23.741 --> 04:28.355
But now, I have 86% more energy
than I used to

04:28.398 --> 04:32.054
because I eat my greens.

04:32.097 --> 04:34.056
And you would know all about
being green,

04:34.099 --> 04:36.145
-wouldn't you, Brainiac-5?
-[laughs]

04:37.189 --> 04:38.365
Supergirl!

04:44.501 --> 04:45.589
[monitor beeps]

04:45.633 --> 04:47.330
Oh! That's even worse
than I thought.

04:47.374 --> 04:49.550
I cannot believe I let you
talk me into doing that.

04:49.593 --> 04:52.292
Nonsense. That PSA
is pitch-perfect.

04:52.335 --> 04:54.119
I mean, sure,
your hair looks a little weird,

04:54.163 --> 04:56.426
-but no one's gonna
notice that.
-Okay.

04:56.470 --> 04:58.385
Look, you said you wanted
to use our role in the media

04:58.428 --> 05:00.256
to bring attention
to important issues.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.475
I meant weightier issues,

05:01.518 --> 05:03.346
like mental health,
or the welfare system.

05:03.390 --> 05:05.479
Healthy eating?
That's important.

05:05.522 --> 05:07.568
I mean, you must have heard
how I struggled with it.

05:07.611 --> 05:09.221
It was gross.

05:09.265 --> 05:12.442
Brainy, I'm sorry,
but I cannot let this go live.

05:12.486 --> 05:14.183
CatCo posted it 20 minutes ago.

05:14.226 --> 05:17.839
What? You-- You sent it to
Andrea without asking me?

05:17.882 --> 05:20.624
-I asked you, didn't I?
-No! No, you didn't...

05:20.668 --> 05:22.452
Whatever. It's fine. It's fine.

05:22.496 --> 05:25.281
We can have Andrea pull it
before too many people see it.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.936
-It's already garnered
800,000 views.
-800...

05:27.979 --> 05:30.547
You were right.
When we spotlight an issue,

05:30.591 --> 05:32.593
the populace really listens.

05:32.636 --> 05:34.421
My heart is beating so fast.

05:34.464 --> 05:36.510
-[panting] Listen...
-[woman grunting]

05:40.818 --> 05:41.732
[grunts]

05:42.864 --> 05:44.605
Come on.

05:44.648 --> 05:46.389
Your turn.
Get me on the ground.

05:48.086 --> 05:49.914
[both grunting]

05:53.483 --> 05:55.355
Come on. Get me on the ground.

05:59.620 --> 06:01.404
-[grunting]
-Come on. You got this.

06:09.456 --> 06:10.761
How did you do that?

06:10.805 --> 06:12.546
Doesn't matter, it's not
the move you showed me.

06:12.589 --> 06:14.374
-Yeah, but it works
better, anyway.
-Let's just go again, okay?

06:14.417 --> 06:15.505
Okay.

06:15.549 --> 06:18.290
I remember my training days.
[chuckles]

06:18.334 --> 06:22.599
Alex made me train blindfolded
under Kryptonite emitters.

06:22.643 --> 06:26.516
And if that wasn't bad enough,
then she made me
study the tapes.

06:26.560 --> 06:28.562
-Yes.
-It was not pretty.

06:28.605 --> 06:30.172
-[chuckling]
-[phone vibrating]

06:33.784 --> 06:36.787
Oh! It's work.
I gotta go, I'm sorry.

06:36.831 --> 06:38.485
Is everything okay?

06:38.528 --> 06:39.834
It's Joey's group home.

06:39.877 --> 06:41.531
Apparently he just got some
news from Orlando.

06:41.575 --> 06:43.490
The apartment fell through.

06:43.533 --> 06:46.318
What? I thought they were
supposed to move in
next month. What happened?

06:46.362 --> 06:49.670
I don't know. But I need
to be there for Joey.

06:49.713 --> 06:51.323
I promised him
I'd have his back.

06:51.367 --> 06:53.891
Yeah, I made the same promise
to Orlando. I better find him.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.080
Supergirl. What are you
doing here?

07:09.124 --> 07:11.779
I heard from Joey's caseworker
that you lost your housing.

07:13.171 --> 07:14.172
I'm sorry.

07:16.174 --> 07:17.698
Same old story.

07:17.741 --> 07:19.351
As soon as things
start to get better,

07:19.395 --> 07:21.484
the world just knocks you
right back down.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.661
You think I'd be used to it
by now.

07:25.706 --> 07:28.186
Can you tell me what happened?

07:28.230 --> 07:32.843
Joey and I were supposed
to move into this building,
the Ormfell.

07:32.887 --> 07:34.541
It was a part of a program

07:34.584 --> 07:37.065
that offered affordable housing
for people like me.

07:37.108 --> 07:39.328
People who were recently
incarcerated.

07:39.371 --> 07:44.594
But now, some tech company
is buying it instead, so...

07:44.638 --> 07:47.554
back to crashing
on a friend's couch.

07:47.597 --> 07:50.513
The same friend that
landed me here in prison
in the first place.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.515
I'm sorry. That's so horrible.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.563
Can I help you find
an apartment or...

07:56.606 --> 07:58.826
Wish it was that simple.

07:58.869 --> 08:02.133
I can't afford a place here
until I get a decent job.

08:02.177 --> 08:04.527
And I can't get a decent job
until I have a place to live,

08:04.571 --> 08:08.618
and I can't get Joey
out of that group home
until I have both.

08:08.662 --> 08:11.229
I was really counting
on that housing program.

08:12.404 --> 08:13.841
A lot of people were,

08:13.884 --> 08:17.018
and City Council just took it
away without a thought.

08:17.061 --> 08:20.021
Look, I appreciate everything
you've done, Supergirl,

08:21.631 --> 08:23.285
but this is how it always goes.

08:23.328 --> 08:25.548
Things get better
until they get worse.

08:27.811 --> 08:28.638
Orlando.

08:31.423 --> 08:35.036
I told you I'd have your back,
and I meant it.

08:40.998 --> 08:43.261
[beeping]

08:44.698 --> 08:45.786
[man] Bingo!

09:05.457 --> 09:06.763
There she is.

09:06.807 --> 09:08.765
My main attraction.

09:08.809 --> 09:10.767
Let me out of here. Now.

09:10.811 --> 09:12.987
Sorry, no can do.

09:13.030 --> 09:15.859
It's not every day you run into
a Fifth Dimensional imp,

09:15.903 --> 09:17.818
let alone expertly trap one.

09:17.861 --> 09:19.776
No, I got big plans
for you and me.

09:19.820 --> 09:21.604
See, with you
as my leading lady,

09:21.648 --> 09:25.390
there's no way Naxim
can resist starting up
the menagerie again.

09:26.130 --> 09:26.957
Oh!

09:28.002 --> 09:30.004
-Uh...
-[keypad beeping]

09:30.047 --> 09:32.310
I'm sorry to have to
tell you this...

09:33.877 --> 09:36.271
but I have no powers.

09:36.314 --> 09:39.579
I was stripped of them
and banished here,

09:39.622 --> 09:44.061
to walk the Earth
a mere mortal.
It's pathetic, really.

09:44.105 --> 09:47.717
I mean, who wants to see
a powerless imp?

09:50.938 --> 09:53.244
I'm afraid I'm useless to you.

09:53.288 --> 09:55.899
Well, Naxim isn't gonna
wanna team up with me now.

09:57.684 --> 09:58.989
You're free to go.

10:01.949 --> 10:03.646
I'm sure you'll find the exit.

10:20.663 --> 10:25.799
You know, I might not be
a worthy headliner
in my current state,

10:25.842 --> 10:28.540
but perhaps I can help you
get someone better.

10:30.891 --> 10:33.633
Someone like... Supergirl.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.724
Do you think she'd help
bring your Naxim back?

10:37.767 --> 10:40.422
-You wanna go after Supergirl?
-Mmm-hmm.

10:40.465 --> 10:43.512
And how are you gonna do that?
You've got no powers.

10:43.555 --> 10:44.905
Powers aren't everything.

10:44.948 --> 10:49.779
An effective trap
requires know-how
and ingenuity,

10:49.823 --> 10:51.694
and I have those in spades.

10:51.738 --> 10:56.394
We'd just need a little help
constructing said trap.

10:57.613 --> 10:59.571
An expert engineer or...

10:59.615 --> 11:02.400
Well, I could capture
an engineer.

11:02.444 --> 11:03.880
Oh?

11:03.924 --> 11:05.795
Wait, why are you
doing this for me?

11:05.839 --> 11:09.407
You were just very kind to me
when you didn't need to be.

11:10.452 --> 11:13.063
This is my way of saying
"Thank you."

11:13.107 --> 11:14.674
So do we have a deal?

11:16.153 --> 11:17.111
Okay.

11:18.329 --> 11:20.462
[chuckles] Okay.

11:20.505 --> 11:23.813
Let's go find our third wheel,
then, shall we?

11:27.208 --> 11:29.514
-[elevator dings]
-And she's HUD?

11:29.558 --> 11:30.820
Uh-huh.

11:30.864 --> 11:32.735
Okay, great, thanks
for the contact, Franklin.

11:33.954 --> 11:35.912
Thank you.

11:35.956 --> 11:39.220
Kara. I've been experimenting
with almond flour alternatives,

11:39.263 --> 11:40.656
and I need a honest palate.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.266
You know I'm always down
for a taste test,

11:42.310 --> 11:43.833
but I'm kind of snowed
under right now.

11:43.877 --> 11:45.835
Okay. "Affordable housing
suffers funding cuts,"

11:45.879 --> 11:48.098
"Housing statistics for the
Heights." What is all this?

11:48.142 --> 11:50.187
Our next cover story
with Supergirl.

11:50.231 --> 11:51.493
Okay.

11:51.536 --> 11:53.190
You've heard what's
going in the Heights

11:53.234 --> 11:55.018
with the Ormfell building,
yeah?

11:55.062 --> 11:57.064
Councilwoman Jean Rankin
was able to negotiate a bid
from Orquoia,

11:57.107 --> 11:58.979
the largest cloud computing
company in the world.

11:59.022 --> 12:00.763
They wanna use the Ormfell
as their new HQ.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.243
-Why?
-Thank you.

12:02.286 --> 12:04.332
Well, did you know that before
the bid was negotiated,

12:04.375 --> 12:07.770
the Ormfell was actually set
aside for low-income housing

12:07.814 --> 12:11.687
with a percentage of the space
dedicated to recently
unincarcerated.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.472
I'd heard rumors the bid was
pushing out the earmark,

12:14.516 --> 12:15.996
but people in the Heights
seem ecstatic

12:16.039 --> 12:17.824
at the prospect
of this company.

12:17.867 --> 12:20.391
So much so I guess the Council
is holding the vote
at the Ormfell.

12:20.435 --> 12:22.089
Yeah, the community's
only ecstatic

12:22.132 --> 12:24.134
because they don't know
the other side of the story.

12:24.178 --> 12:25.832
Especially when it comes to

12:25.875 --> 12:28.356
how housing stability
and recidivism are related.

12:28.399 --> 12:30.706
Plus a lack
of permanent address

12:30.750 --> 12:33.230
could make it difficult
for people to get jobs,

12:33.274 --> 12:36.320
and make them more at risk
for parole violations.

12:36.364 --> 12:39.541
I mean, the ramifications
are endless.

12:39.584 --> 12:41.717
-[chewing] God, that's good!
-Thank you.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.937
All of this is terrible,
but what does that have
to do with Supergirl?

12:43.980 --> 12:48.071
Well, City Council is voting
on the Orquoia deal
tomorrow morning,

12:48.115 --> 12:50.204
and Supergirl wants to change
their minds.

12:50.247 --> 12:51.988
That might be a tall order.

12:52.032 --> 12:53.337
My source at city hall said

12:53.381 --> 12:55.122
Rankin spent years
putting this deal together.

12:55.165 --> 12:56.514
I doubt she'd fold.

12:56.558 --> 12:58.255
Well, she might,

12:58.299 --> 13:01.215
if her constituents
can pressure her
to see things differently.

13:01.258 --> 13:03.391
Supergirl thinks
that an interview from her

13:03.434 --> 13:05.872
and a few educational articles
from us

13:05.915 --> 13:07.395
could get people in the Heights

13:07.438 --> 13:09.571
to see the benefits
of affordable housing

13:09.614 --> 13:11.878
and convince City Council
to restore the Ormfell building

13:11.921 --> 13:13.357
to its original status.

13:13.401 --> 13:16.273
Ten out of ten for enthusiasm,
dear Kara.

13:16.317 --> 13:20.887
But as for entertainment value,
this strategy is DOA.

13:20.930 --> 13:24.629
Look, I hear the import
on Supergirl's cause,

13:24.673 --> 13:26.196
but the vote's tomorrow.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.024
If she wants to sway
the council's opinion,

13:28.068 --> 13:30.897
she needs the public engrossed
and engaged like yesterday.

13:30.940 --> 13:34.074
And a few statistics
and a colorful pie chart

13:34.117 --> 13:36.076
might not get
the blood pumping.

13:36.119 --> 13:37.904
I've got three words for you.

13:37.947 --> 13:40.602
"Social media takeover."

13:40.645 --> 13:44.084
Supergirl can use CatCo's
account to do a Q & A.

13:44.127 --> 13:45.912
We'll stream it live
on the website,

13:45.955 --> 13:48.828
let our readers chime in
with questions and comments
in real time.

13:48.871 --> 13:51.047
I don't know
if that's her style, though.

13:51.091 --> 13:55.443
Oh, dare I remind Supergirl
that we are living
in a technological age

13:55.486 --> 13:57.445
where hashtags
are battle cries,

13:57.488 --> 14:01.014
and the fuse of a revolution
can be lit by just one tweet.

14:01.057 --> 14:06.149
This takeover can circulate
her cause around the world
in a millisecond.

14:06.193 --> 14:08.412
I mean, just look how fast
the PSA went viral.

14:08.456 --> 14:11.589
-I mean, about that PSA--
-My point exactly.

14:11.633 --> 14:14.984
Have Supergirl do the takeover.
She can thank me later.

14:25.995 --> 14:26.996
I did it!

14:29.999 --> 14:31.000
There you go.

14:31.044 --> 14:32.480
[raven screeches]

14:34.308 --> 14:36.571
The cage, what does it mean?

14:36.614 --> 14:37.659
You tell me.

14:38.921 --> 14:41.358
[raven screeching]

14:41.402 --> 14:42.098
No!

14:42.142 --> 14:44.057
[screeching intensifies]

14:44.100 --> 14:45.319
I have to get out of here.

14:52.021 --> 14:54.241
You have to fight the impulse
to run, Nia.

14:54.284 --> 14:56.373
You must never exit a dream
out of fear.

14:56.417 --> 14:59.028
I'm not afraid. I just...

14:59.072 --> 15:01.726
I just saw enough of the dream
to decode Nyxly's plan.

15:01.770 --> 15:03.728
The ravens are
just a distraction.

15:03.772 --> 15:05.687
There are no distractions
in the dream realm.

15:05.730 --> 15:08.951
Everything has meaning.
What do the ravens mean?

15:08.995 --> 15:10.083
I don't know!

15:10.997 --> 15:12.085
You do.

15:12.128 --> 15:13.956
Quiet the voices in your mind.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.002
Quiet the fear.

15:16.045 --> 15:20.006
-[screeching continues]
-Ravens mean misfortune...

15:21.094 --> 15:23.096
wisdom...

15:23.139 --> 15:28.144
Connect to the interplay
between your deepest self
and the universe.

15:28.188 --> 15:30.538
What do the ravens mean to you?

15:37.937 --> 15:39.895
[screeching fades]

15:49.078 --> 15:50.340
That's...

16:02.004 --> 16:03.571
It's my old dollhouse.

16:11.013 --> 16:11.971
This dream...

16:15.061 --> 16:16.888
I've been here before.

16:22.155 --> 16:23.199
Nia?

16:24.070 --> 16:25.071
Maeve.

16:31.860 --> 16:32.774
[clears throat]

16:36.430 --> 16:38.606
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

16:38.649 --> 16:43.741
Well, thank you for helping
with this. I've never done
one of these before.

16:43.785 --> 16:45.265
You got this. Ready?

16:45.308 --> 16:47.049
I guess.

16:47.093 --> 16:48.572
Can we have our first question?

16:48.616 --> 16:51.053
Uh... A lot of comments
about broccoli?

16:52.315 --> 16:54.491
Here.

16:54.535 --> 16:56.885
[man] Supergirl,
your perspective about
the Ormfell surprises me.

16:56.928 --> 16:58.843
I live in the Heights,

16:58.887 --> 17:00.323
and Orquoia will bring
improvements
my neighborhood needs.

17:00.367 --> 17:02.064
How is that a bad thing?

17:02.108 --> 17:05.937
That is a very good question,
sir, and you're right.

17:05.981 --> 17:08.636
The deal would bring new
improvements to the Heights,

17:08.679 --> 17:11.291
but it would come
at a human cost.

17:13.380 --> 17:14.642
Next question?

17:16.339 --> 17:18.037
[woman] Supergirl.

17:18.080 --> 17:19.647
You're always going on TV,
telling people like me

17:19.690 --> 17:21.823
to have hope that things
will get better.

17:21.866 --> 17:25.522
And now that they finally are,
you want us to give
all that up?

17:25.566 --> 17:27.263
You're a hypocrite.

17:27.307 --> 17:28.177
Um...

17:29.874 --> 17:31.050
[device beeping]

17:31.093 --> 17:32.616
-[man 2] Help me!
-Someone's in trouble.

17:32.660 --> 17:35.010
I'm sorry, I... I have to go.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.150
Let him go.

17:45.629 --> 17:47.153
Wait, don't I know you?

17:48.067 --> 17:49.155
Interesting story.

17:58.251 --> 18:00.209
I've searched every corner
of the city

18:00.253 --> 18:02.255
and I still can't find them.

18:02.298 --> 18:04.344
Do we have an ID on the victim?

18:04.387 --> 18:06.607
His name is Dr. Desmond Raab.

18:06.650 --> 18:08.261
Originally from the planet
Edifar,

18:08.304 --> 18:10.437
a race of aliens
known for their
building capabilities

18:10.480 --> 18:12.047
and technological advances.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.918
Moved to Earth two years ago
with his family.

18:13.962 --> 18:15.703
[Supergirl] Huh.
What about the kidnapper?

18:15.746 --> 18:19.402
Naxim Tork and his sidekick,
Mitch.

18:19.446 --> 18:20.838
Though thanks
to image inducers,

18:20.882 --> 18:23.189
Mitch is looking less blue
these days.

18:23.232 --> 18:26.366
-They used to run
a cosmic menagerie.
-That's right.

18:26.409 --> 18:30.370
He tried to kidnap me
in high school, make me
a part of his sideshow.

18:30.413 --> 18:33.199
But I only saw Mitch. No Naxim.

18:33.242 --> 18:36.332
According to the files, Naxim
fled Earth sometime last year.

18:36.376 --> 18:39.640
How? I thought the DEO
put those two away years ago.

18:39.683 --> 18:41.990
We did. Naxim and Mitch
were released by Lex

18:42.033 --> 18:43.731
sometime before the DEO
was destroyed.

18:43.774 --> 18:45.863
Well, what's Mitch been up to
since he was released?

18:45.907 --> 18:47.909
Well, there's no
known address on file.

18:47.952 --> 18:50.259
It looks like he's been
in and out of county jail,

18:50.303 --> 18:52.392
just a few petty thefts,
one B and E.

18:52.435 --> 18:54.872
Sounds like small-time crime
wasn't paying him enough money,

18:54.916 --> 18:57.353
so he sparked up
the menagerie again.

18:57.397 --> 18:58.876
Hence the kidnapping.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.183
-[keypad beeping]
-I tried tracing their ship.

19:01.227 --> 19:04.534
Either it left with Naxim,
or Mitch is using
a cloaking device.

19:04.578 --> 19:06.319
God, another dead end?

19:06.362 --> 19:10.366
Feels like we just put this
guy away and now we have
to do it again.

19:10.410 --> 19:11.672
What are the odds of that?

19:11.715 --> 19:14.327
Based on Mitch's history
of non-violent offenses,

19:14.370 --> 19:17.765
his destitution, lack o
support system and welfare
available to him,

19:17.808 --> 19:19.767
and his overall
lack of aptitude,

19:19.810 --> 19:20.681
two in five.

19:23.162 --> 19:26.208
Recidivism is nothing
if not statistically reliable.

19:26.252 --> 19:29.255
[Supergirl] That's why
the Ormfell vote tomorrow
is so important.

19:29.298 --> 19:32.432
I need to figure out
how to sway that vote stat.

19:32.475 --> 19:34.782
Maybe if I speak directly
to Councilwoman Rankin,

19:34.825 --> 19:37.959
I can convince her not to hand
the building over to Orquoia.

19:38.002 --> 19:39.917
You guys keep looking
for Mitch and Dr. Raab.

19:39.961 --> 19:41.571
Let me know
if you find anything.

19:44.487 --> 19:46.446
[Maeve] Nia, wanna play?

19:51.015 --> 19:52.365
What's that in your hand?

19:56.456 --> 19:57.370
I don't know.

19:58.501 --> 20:01.417
It's beautiful. Can I have it?

20:03.071 --> 20:04.594
Pretty please?

20:04.638 --> 20:07.641
If you give me the light,
I'll love you forever.

20:11.340 --> 20:12.950
[crackling]

20:13.908 --> 20:16.040
-It hurts.
-I'm sorry.

20:16.084 --> 20:17.303
Turn it off!

20:17.346 --> 20:20.610
I'm trying. I--
I don't know how!

20:20.654 --> 20:23.483
[raven screeching]

20:31.360 --> 20:32.622
Maeve.

20:34.058 --> 20:35.321
The ravens are Maeve.

20:40.282 --> 20:41.327
You were right.

20:43.329 --> 20:44.721
I was afraid.

20:44.765 --> 20:47.376
I didn't wanna face them
because I can't face Maeve.

20:49.378 --> 20:51.119
I never meant to hurt her.

20:51.162 --> 20:52.903
I know, my love.

20:52.947 --> 20:55.776
All she ever wanted
were the powers.

20:55.819 --> 20:58.169
Deep down, I knew
they were mine.

20:59.345 --> 21:00.302
So I ran.

21:01.477 --> 21:03.044
I ran to become a reporter.

21:03.087 --> 21:06.308
I ran so my light
wouldn't burn her.

21:06.352 --> 21:08.528
And I just kept running.

21:09.442 --> 21:11.487
Even now, I'm running.

21:11.531 --> 21:15.143
Because if I own these powers,

21:15.186 --> 21:17.232
it just means I'm gonna
hurt her more.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.582
My darling girl,

21:19.626 --> 21:23.456
your authentic self is
the greatest gift you give
to the world.

21:23.499 --> 21:25.327
Hiding my light hurt me.

21:26.502 --> 21:28.287
And never helped anyone.

21:29.592 --> 21:31.202
I still lost her.

21:36.382 --> 21:37.513
[sobbing]

21:39.385 --> 21:41.256
CatCo, the Daily Planet

21:41.300 --> 21:44.259
and the big five networks
are all confirmed, right?

21:44.303 --> 21:46.609
I want this vote
to get wall-to-wall coverage.

21:48.394 --> 21:50.047
[whooshing]

21:50.091 --> 21:53.094
Supergirl.
What a pleasant surprise?

21:53.137 --> 21:57.098
By the way,
my daughter loves your PSAs.

21:57.141 --> 21:59.274
She gets a kick out of that
funny little green man.

21:59.318 --> 22:02.277
Just trying to make a positive
impact on my community,

22:02.321 --> 22:05.454
which actually brings me
to the purpose of my visit.

22:05.498 --> 22:08.196
Please consider voting no
on the Orquoia deal.

22:08.239 --> 22:10.633
Why in high heavens
would I do that?

22:10.677 --> 22:12.505
Reverting the Ormfell
back to its original purpose

22:12.548 --> 22:16.291
could give the recently
unincarcerated people
living there

22:16.335 --> 22:18.772
the support they need to get
their lives back on track.

22:18.815 --> 22:20.382
Housing projects like this

22:20.426 --> 22:22.558
also benefit the community
by reducing eviction--

22:22.602 --> 22:26.562
That's exactly what I'm trying
to do with Orquoia.

22:26.606 --> 22:30.653
Improve the community
and the lives of everyone
that lives there.

22:32.568 --> 22:35.223
A deal like this could
inject the Heights

22:35.266 --> 22:38.400
with new money, growth,
opportunity.

22:38.444 --> 22:40.794
That's exactly what affordable
housing could do.

22:40.837 --> 22:42.448
Instead of investing
in a corporation,

22:42.491 --> 22:45.059
you'd be investing
in the people
to create that change.

22:45.102 --> 22:48.454
Do you know how many people
are Orquoia employs?

22:48.497 --> 22:50.717
They add billions to the GDP
each year.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.849
A business of this magnitude

22:52.893 --> 22:55.069
would increase property values
in the Heights,

22:55.112 --> 22:57.593
bring better schools to the
area, improve infrastructure--

22:57.637 --> 22:59.508
You're talking about
gentrification,

22:59.552 --> 23:01.771
which prices out everyone
who currently lives
in the Heights.

23:01.815 --> 23:03.469
I am talking about progress.

23:03.512 --> 23:06.123
I've spent years
putting this deal together,

23:06.167 --> 23:08.822
and when it closes,
it will be the largest
community investment

23:08.865 --> 23:10.606
in the history
of National City.

23:10.650 --> 23:12.608
You want me
to sacrifice all that

23:12.652 --> 23:15.263
so a bunch of criminals
can have a roof
over their heads?

23:15.306 --> 23:17.308
Stick to leafy greens,
Supergirl.

23:18.484 --> 23:20.181
Leave the politicking to me.

23:29.364 --> 23:32.585
Looks like I'm not the only one
working out my aggression.

23:32.628 --> 23:33.499
Mind if I join?

23:33.542 --> 23:34.804
Be my guest.

23:37.764 --> 23:40.201
Any sign of Dr. Raab or Mitch?

23:40.244 --> 23:42.464
No, but everyone's out
searching the city,

23:42.508 --> 23:44.118
so we should hear
something soon.

23:46.729 --> 23:48.427
-[grunts]
-[crashing]

23:50.864 --> 23:53.997
Rankin doesn't care about
anything but her own ambition.

23:54.041 --> 23:56.217
I even talked to two other
City Council members

23:56.260 --> 23:59.438
to try to get them
to see my way,
but it was useless.

24:01.091 --> 24:03.529
Looks like the Ormfell
is going to Orquoia anyway.

24:05.182 --> 24:06.053
[sighs]

24:06.096 --> 24:08.098
Nothing is going right today.

24:10.361 --> 24:12.146
[grunts, groans]

24:12.189 --> 24:14.453
Hey, I know you're frustrated
about your training,

24:14.496 --> 24:16.846
but don't you think
you're being a little
hard on yourself?

24:17.673 --> 24:20.241
You, Nia, Brainy, J'onn,

24:21.155 --> 24:22.417
you have powers.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.811
Alex has her gauntlet
and her combat skills.

24:24.854 --> 24:26.552
How am I going to fight
beside all of you

24:26.595 --> 24:28.510
when I can't even
master one move?

24:28.554 --> 24:29.772
What are you talking about?

24:29.816 --> 24:31.992
I saw you take down Alex.
That was awesome.

24:32.035 --> 24:34.168
Yeah, but I couldn't get the
move she was showing me.

24:34.211 --> 24:35.735
Who cares?

24:35.778 --> 24:38.389
The way you used her momentum
against her

24:38.433 --> 24:40.391
was efficient and brilliant.

24:40.435 --> 24:43.220
You just have to shift
your perspective

24:43.264 --> 24:46.049
so that you see how capable
we already know you are.

24:47.747 --> 24:49.009
Maybe you're right.

24:50.576 --> 24:52.229
[cell phone chiming]

24:54.623 --> 24:55.842
Is it Joey?

24:57.104 --> 24:59.106
No, I, um...

24:59.149 --> 25:02.370
I set an alert
for your healthy eating PSA.

25:02.413 --> 25:05.155
Oh, wow, you are already
at five million views.

25:05.199 --> 25:06.592
Oh, my God.

25:06.635 --> 25:08.768
-Congrats.
-[groaning]

25:09.420 --> 25:11.597
[laughs]

25:11.640 --> 25:12.772
You know what?

25:12.815 --> 25:14.382
Good for Brainy.

25:14.425 --> 25:17.211
He found something
that resonated with people.

25:17.254 --> 25:19.518
Meanwhile, I can't
get anyone to see

25:19.561 --> 25:22.216
how important the Ormfell would
be to someone like Orlando.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.960
Maybe I should publish
the recidivism statistics.

25:28.352 --> 25:31.704
I don't think it was
the healthy eating statistics

25:31.747 --> 25:33.793
that resonated with people.

25:33.836 --> 25:36.012
It was Brainy's personal story.

25:36.056 --> 25:39.538
Okay. Um... When you
talk down a bad guy,

25:39.581 --> 25:42.323
you don't rattle off
facts and figures.

25:42.366 --> 25:45.239
You share your personal
experiences.

25:45.282 --> 25:48.111
And that's what inspires people
to do the right thing.

25:49.722 --> 25:50.723
Yeah, you're right.

25:52.551 --> 25:55.466
My voice is not the one
that's important right now.

25:57.294 --> 25:58.600
Maybe I step aside

25:58.644 --> 26:01.037
and use my platform
to amplify others' voices.

26:01.081 --> 26:03.605
Now that will resonate
with people.

26:13.615 --> 26:18.185
Hi. Um, I thought our little
friend was building a trap
for Supergirl.

26:18.228 --> 26:21.101
That cube looks too small
to snatch a mouse.

26:21.144 --> 26:23.538
That device might not
look like much,

26:23.582 --> 26:27.455
but trust me,
it's our Trojan horse.

26:35.724 --> 26:37.378
Thanks.

26:37.421 --> 26:39.032
I knew that if I could
just see you,

26:39.075 --> 26:42.122
I would gain the knowledge
that's been eluding me.

26:42.165 --> 26:45.038
Yes, you've gained
the knowledge you seek.

26:45.865 --> 26:47.344
But at what price?

26:48.694 --> 26:50.173
Whatever it is, I'll fix it.

26:51.740 --> 26:52.915
There's an ancient story...

26:55.875 --> 26:58.921
About a woman
who slandered her friend.

27:00.357 --> 27:03.883
The woman went to her rabbi,
full of remorse.

27:03.926 --> 27:06.407
The rabbi told her
to cut up a feather pillow

27:06.450 --> 27:09.149
and to scatter the feathers
into the wind.

27:09.889 --> 27:11.891
He then instructed her

27:11.934 --> 27:16.722
to go out and collect
every single feather.

27:16.765 --> 27:18.506
She cried,
"That was impossible!"

27:18.549 --> 27:19.812
And the rabbi replied,

27:19.855 --> 27:21.596
"No more impossible

27:21.640 --> 27:25.948
than to completely undo
the wrongs of your actions."

27:27.646 --> 27:30.126
You made a dark bargain, Nia.

27:30.170 --> 27:33.086
You unleashed Nyxly
on this world.

27:33.129 --> 27:35.915
And the actions
she will inflict

27:35.958 --> 27:37.699
will be like those feathers.

27:37.743 --> 27:39.614
So what should I do?

27:39.658 --> 27:41.747
This is not about doing, Nia.

27:41.790 --> 27:45.838
Just like your dreams,
the ravens, your sister,

27:45.881 --> 27:48.362
you cannot run away from this.

27:48.405 --> 27:51.365
You must have the courage
to sit with the pain

27:51.408 --> 27:54.368
to take in the gravity
of what you've done.

27:54.411 --> 27:55.543
I'm so sorry.

27:56.936 --> 27:57.806
I know.

28:05.727 --> 28:07.468
Our time is almost up.

28:07.511 --> 28:10.079
No, I still need you.

28:10.123 --> 28:13.561
What about Nyxly?
How am I supposed to stop her?

28:13.604 --> 28:16.085
The times ahead
will be the most trying yet.

28:16.129 --> 28:18.522
But you can face them.

28:18.566 --> 28:22.396
Trust your dreams,
even if they frighten you.

28:23.179 --> 28:26.052
Sit with your discomfort,

28:26.095 --> 28:28.489
just as you have sat
with your grief today.

28:33.450 --> 28:35.757
If you are willing
to face them,

28:35.801 --> 28:38.107
your dreams will give you
everything you need.

28:39.892 --> 28:41.197
I love you.

28:41.241 --> 28:44.723
I love you
and I believe in you.

28:53.557 --> 28:55.211
[sobbing]

28:58.040 --> 28:59.607
All right, Nyxly.

29:00.869 --> 29:03.611
I'm coming for you.

29:03.654 --> 29:07.397
Good afternoon, everyone.
Let's get straight to the vote.

29:10.705 --> 29:11.706
Supergirl.

29:13.055 --> 29:15.275
National City wants this deal.

29:15.318 --> 29:18.365
And if you couldn't tell from
your little social media stunt,

29:18.408 --> 29:20.367
they don't want to
hear from you.

29:20.410 --> 29:24.197
You're right. They don't need
to hear from me anymore.

29:24.240 --> 29:27.461
But you should hear
from the people you're
planning to displace.

29:28.767 --> 29:29.768
People like me.

29:31.508 --> 29:33.032
Councilwoman,
you don't know me.

29:34.076 --> 29:35.774
But I'm one of
your constituents.

29:37.906 --> 29:39.734
My name is Orlando Davis.

29:41.301 --> 29:44.739
I spent the last two years
at Van Kull Prison,

29:44.783 --> 29:48.308
and was one of the people
counting on housing
in the Ormfell.

29:48.351 --> 29:51.050
I've lived in National City
my entire life

29:51.093 --> 29:52.486
with my little brother Joey.

29:53.748 --> 29:57.099
We lost our parents
when I was 14.

29:57.143 --> 30:01.234
I quit school to take care
of my brother.

30:01.277 --> 30:03.714
But there isn't a big market
out there for dropouts,

30:03.758 --> 30:05.891
so the bills piled up.

30:05.934 --> 30:09.590
I made a stupid mistake

30:09.633 --> 30:11.548
and I've been paying
the price ever since.

30:11.592 --> 30:13.855
But I'm not the only one
who's paid it.

30:13.899 --> 30:17.903
See, I remember
what it felt like
to go to bed at night

30:17.946 --> 30:19.687
with my family nearby.

30:20.906 --> 30:22.037
To feel safe.

30:24.126 --> 30:25.824
To feel loved.

30:25.867 --> 30:26.912
But Joey doesn't.

30:28.652 --> 30:31.960
He's been in and out
of the system his entire life,

30:32.004 --> 30:36.182
and I am so scared that
he's gonna make
the same mistakes that I have

30:36.225 --> 30:38.532
and I can't even be there
to help him.

30:38.575 --> 30:41.709
Because what he needs
is a home.

30:41.752 --> 30:44.190
He is not the only one.

30:44.233 --> 30:46.757
So, I'm here today to ask you
one thing.

30:49.369 --> 30:50.457
See us.

30:52.633 --> 30:56.289
All the people hoping
to live in this building,

30:56.332 --> 30:59.553
when you're deciding
whether to vote
for this deal...

31:01.294 --> 31:02.861
you're voting on our lives,

31:04.036 --> 31:05.776
on our families.

31:07.126 --> 31:10.216
On my chance to give
my brother some hope.

31:12.087 --> 31:13.262
So, please...

31:15.090 --> 31:16.091
see us.

31:40.811 --> 31:42.639
[beeping]

31:42.683 --> 31:45.120
Naxim Tork's ship
just appeared on our radar.

31:46.034 --> 31:47.296
It's go time.

31:49.733 --> 31:52.258
[Mitch] So, I put the device
where you said.

31:54.390 --> 31:55.217
And...

32:01.136 --> 32:01.963
We need to hurry.

32:03.051 --> 32:05.488
[Nyxly] Help. Hello? Help me.

32:09.144 --> 32:10.972
Don't worry. You're safe now.

32:11.016 --> 32:12.626
None of us are safe.

32:12.669 --> 32:15.020
That man was creating
some kind of weapon.

32:16.064 --> 32:18.066
It's a cryo-nuclear bomb.

32:18.110 --> 32:21.026
Strong enough to encapsulate
a Kryptonian in ice forever.

32:21.069 --> 32:22.331
Supergirl.

32:22.375 --> 32:24.377
[screaming and indistinct
shouting]

32:27.162 --> 32:29.338
We need to get everyone
out of here now.

32:36.693 --> 32:38.217
-Stairwell's over there.
-Let's go.

32:38.260 --> 32:40.262
[people screaming]

32:46.747 --> 32:49.010
The cryo-nuke is
in the basement
of the building.

32:49.054 --> 32:50.446
It's a freeze bomb?

32:50.490 --> 32:52.100
If its core gets to
minus 400 degrees Fahrenheit,

32:52.144 --> 32:53.580
a chain reaction will occur,

32:53.623 --> 32:55.103
instantly freezing anything
within a one-mile radius.

32:55.147 --> 32:57.410
If the chain reaction is
triggered, it could trap
even you.

32:57.453 --> 32:58.759
I'm coming with you.

32:58.802 --> 33:00.021
We'll get everyone else
to safety.

33:02.893 --> 33:05.244
Guys. Guys.

33:11.119 --> 33:13.034
Watch out. Look out, look out.

33:27.092 --> 33:28.615
God damn it.

33:28.658 --> 33:30.399
The ice is too thick
to penetrate.

33:30.443 --> 33:33.272
There's a fire escape on the
other side of the building.

33:33.315 --> 33:34.490
-Let's go.
-Okay.

33:36.492 --> 33:37.493
Let's go!

33:47.286 --> 33:48.765
The temperature's dropping
too fast.

33:48.809 --> 33:50.985
It's encased in lead.
I can't see a way to defuse it.

33:54.858 --> 33:56.556
[people screaming]

34:06.348 --> 34:08.568
-[glass breaking]
-[screams]

34:10.265 --> 34:11.962
It's okay. This way. Come on.

34:15.009 --> 34:17.142
The building will collapse
if you don't calm the quaking.

34:17.185 --> 34:18.230
I have to destroy the bomb.

34:18.273 --> 34:20.493
This whole place could explode.

34:20.536 --> 34:22.408
It'll explode if I do nothing.

34:28.457 --> 34:29.850
Here goes nothing.

34:41.427 --> 34:44.343
[indistinct shouting]

34:49.174 --> 34:50.610
This is as far as we can go.

34:53.569 --> 34:55.919
I know I was pushing hard
to get into this building,

34:55.963 --> 34:58.313
but, man, what I wouldn't give
for a ride out.

35:01.751 --> 35:03.579
[Brainy] How's this
for a ride out?

35:03.623 --> 35:04.450
[beeping]

35:09.411 --> 35:10.934
Everyone, on the ship.

35:10.978 --> 35:12.110
Come on.

35:13.328 --> 35:14.634
Nobody touch my chair!

35:36.960 --> 35:37.874
We did it.

35:39.354 --> 35:40.486
[panting]

35:45.926 --> 35:47.884
[indistinct chatter]

35:52.062 --> 35:53.499
Thank you all for staying.

35:53.542 --> 35:56.893
After much deliberation,
the Council has decided...

35:58.286 --> 36:01.246
to rezone the Ormfell
for affordable housing,

36:01.289 --> 36:02.377
effective immediately.

36:05.859 --> 36:06.860
You did this.

36:08.296 --> 36:09.776
Joey's not gonna believe it.

36:13.301 --> 36:14.433
Hey, Councilwoman.

36:16.957 --> 36:18.001
You did the right thing.

36:19.002 --> 36:21.396
Thank you.

36:21.440 --> 36:26.575
That little speech may have
swayed the rest of Council,
but not me.

36:26.619 --> 36:28.751
Now the Heights will be left
to the criminals.

36:30.275 --> 36:31.841
I hope you are happy.

36:31.885 --> 36:34.975
The formerly incarcerated are
members of the community too,

36:35.018 --> 36:38.370
and your council agrees,
they deserve a second chance.

36:45.246 --> 36:46.987
Maybe you should've let her
get taken out.

36:47.030 --> 36:50.860
While Rankin may literally be
the worst person ever,

36:50.904 --> 36:55.256
saving her made me realize
that being a great superhero

36:55.300 --> 36:57.737
isn't about mastering
a single move.

36:58.346 --> 36:59.739
It's about adapting.

37:01.480 --> 37:03.308
That's why I'm gonna make
a kick-ass Guardian.

37:03.351 --> 37:04.961
Damn right it is.

37:12.404 --> 37:14.232
[raven screeching]

37:15.102 --> 37:16.103
Truce.

37:25.982 --> 37:27.027
I must admit,

37:28.376 --> 37:32.206
it was worthwhile
to use our platform

37:32.250 --> 37:35.165
for more than just
promoting healthy eating.

37:36.254 --> 37:38.212
Orlando really made
a difference today.

37:40.388 --> 37:42.434
Why the burdened look?

37:42.477 --> 37:44.262
I was thinking about Mitch,
actually.

37:45.915 --> 37:50.485
How he went back to a life
of crime after all these years.

37:50.529 --> 37:52.705
People like him
slip through the cracks
every day

37:52.748 --> 37:56.361
because the system
isn't designed to help them.

37:56.404 --> 37:59.799
Don't get me wrong.
I am so happy Orlando won
this one today.

37:59.842 --> 38:02.280
But I can't help but think
that's all this is...

38:03.759 --> 38:05.239
It's one.

38:05.283 --> 38:08.329
The fight for systemic change
often feels never-ending.

38:09.765 --> 38:13.465
All we can do is
keep showing up.

38:13.508 --> 38:15.989
Keep sharing our platform.

38:16.032 --> 38:18.339
I can't promise you
it'll ever get easier.

38:20.254 --> 38:21.690
But I can promise this...

38:23.779 --> 38:25.520
I will be beside you.

38:26.782 --> 38:28.044
Every step of the way.

38:30.395 --> 38:32.266
Sorry to interrupt.

38:32.310 --> 38:35.269
We picked up
an energy signature
coming from the Ormfell.

38:35.313 --> 38:36.879
That's strange.

38:36.923 --> 38:39.099
The energy from the cryo-nuke
should have dissipated by now.

38:39.142 --> 38:41.754
It could be residual
from my heat vision.

38:41.797 --> 38:43.364
I'll check it out
on my way home.

39:13.655 --> 39:14.439
Nyxly?

39:14.482 --> 39:17.833
Miss me? Be honest.

39:21.489 --> 39:23.143
[Supergirl grunting]

39:23.186 --> 39:25.101
[Nyxly] Well, look at that.
You're powerless now.

39:25.145 --> 39:26.407
[grunts]

39:26.451 --> 39:27.930
I know we didn't end things
on a chipper note

39:27.974 --> 39:31.412
when you left me to die
in the Phantom Zone.

39:31.456 --> 39:33.283
But I wanted to thank you.

39:33.327 --> 39:38.288
You see, when I got to Earth,
my powers were nil, nothing.

39:38.332 --> 39:39.812
Nada.

39:39.855 --> 39:42.815
I had to use every resource,
every ounce of my ingenuity

39:42.858 --> 39:44.512
to build something
that would restore me.

39:44.556 --> 39:48.211
But, you know,
it just wasn't quite enough.

39:48.255 --> 39:50.997
-[grunts]
-Until you came around.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.042
Then you gave it the boost
it needed.

39:54.696 --> 39:57.612
My heat vision didn't destroy
your weapon, it powered it.

39:59.571 --> 40:02.443
-I gave you your powers back.
-Mmm-hmm.

40:02.487 --> 40:05.054
Sentinel, Martian Manhunter,
I need backup now.

40:07.622 --> 40:08.928
Uh-oh.

40:10.233 --> 40:12.410
-You're all alone.
-[grunting]

40:12.453 --> 40:14.020
Utterly powerless.

40:14.063 --> 40:16.979
I felt that,
time and time again.

40:18.328 --> 40:20.374
All those years
in the Phantom Zone,

40:20.418 --> 40:22.463
there was only one thought
that kept me going.

40:22.507 --> 40:24.160
Do you wanna know what it was?

40:24.204 --> 40:29.035
That, one day,
I would go back to my home,

40:29.078 --> 40:32.081
to my father,
and I would kill him.

40:32.908 --> 40:34.693
I would stick him with a spit

40:34.736 --> 40:37.478
and roast him
like the pig that he is.

40:39.001 --> 40:41.526
A violent thought. [chuckles]

40:41.569 --> 40:42.570
I know.

40:43.528 --> 40:44.833
But he betrayed me.

40:46.487 --> 40:47.488
And so did you.

40:47.532 --> 40:48.707
You gave me no choice.

40:48.750 --> 40:51.623
We were partners, friends.

40:51.666 --> 40:55.627
And yet you destroyed my last
hope right before my very eyes.

40:56.584 --> 40:58.194
I never thought
I would recover.

40:59.457 --> 41:02.372
But as I struggled
to keep myself alive,

41:03.678 --> 41:05.680
a new thought kept me going.

41:06.681 --> 41:08.291
That, one day,

41:08.335 --> 41:11.425
you would know the pain
that I felt.

41:12.731 --> 41:14.210
You would watch

41:14.254 --> 41:20.086
as your greatest hope
crumbled before your very eyes.

41:20.129 --> 41:23.655
And unlike you,
I'm a woman of my word.

41:24.612 --> 41:26.658
So...

41:26.701 --> 41:27.963
Let's get on with it, shall we?

41:29.399 --> 41:30.618
No!

41:30.662 --> 41:32.751
-No!
-[rumbling]

41:37.233 --> 41:41.542
Struggle all you want,
Supergirl. [chuckles]
It won't work.

41:41.586 --> 41:42.630
[grunts]

41:42.674 --> 41:44.545
You're bound by magic now.

41:44.589 --> 41:46.416
And only magic can beat magic.

41:47.635 --> 41:49.289
Mr. Mxyzptlk!

41:57.863 --> 42:00.126
