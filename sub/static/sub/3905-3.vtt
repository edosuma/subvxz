WEBVTT

00:09.092 --> 00:11.427
Okay, define orphan, Sarah.

00:11.469 --> 00:12.845
Orphan, orphanage.

00:12.929 --> 00:14.763
So, you don't know your birth parents?

00:14.931 --> 00:16.598
No, I was fostered out

00:16.641 --> 00:18.934
then legally adopted and I came here.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.478
- When?
- Adopted, like, eight.

00:21.563 --> 00:22.688
Came here around 12.

00:22.772 --> 00:24.940
Heartbreaking.
Can we get back to Beth, please?

00:25.567 --> 00:26.692
Suicide?

00:26.776 --> 00:27.776
I don't accept that.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.319
This one's some kind of low-life grifter.

00:29.404 --> 00:30.612
How do we know she didn't push her?

00:30.697 --> 00:33.949
Oi! I already told you, I didn't wanna be her.

00:33.992 --> 00:36.035
I got stuck. I was running from my own shit.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.786
- I can only imagine.
- Alison.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.664
I'm very sorry about Beth, okay?

00:40.749 --> 00:44.543
But she was losing it, like clinically.

00:44.627 --> 00:46.336
She was a cop.

00:46.421 --> 00:49.631
She had tools. if she couldn't
cope, then I mean...

00:49.716 --> 00:52.426
Look, can you just tell me
what the hell this is?

00:53.344 --> 00:56.305
- Don't tell her anything.
- Uh, short answer?

00:56.389 --> 00:57.806
No.

00:57.849 --> 01:00.309
- How are we all related?
- We're not.

01:00.351 --> 01:02.603
Well, we are, by nature.

01:02.645 --> 01:04.688
Um, she's referring to nurture.

01:04.772 --> 01:07.066
Just give us the briefcase
that you got from the German.

01:07.150 --> 01:09.234
I'm not giving you shit
till you give me some answers.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.819
You don't rate answers.

01:10.862 --> 01:13.280
- Alison...
- Fine, she wants in?

01:14.657 --> 01:15.949
We're clones.

01:15.992 --> 01:18.243
We're someone's experiment
and they're killing us off.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.829
Is that helpful? Hmm?

01:22.749 --> 01:24.291
Mummy?

01:24.709 --> 01:25.793
Gemma, come here.

01:25.835 --> 01:27.002
Who are those ladies?

01:27.087 --> 01:29.421
Just...
They're just mummy's friends.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.673
Why did you get out of bed?

01:33.009 --> 01:34.927
Sorry.

01:35.011 --> 01:37.638
I wanted to float
that whole clone thing a lot softer.

01:42.685 --> 01:44.645
Come on, Sarah... Oh, shit.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.191
You're not supposed
to be parked here at night.

01:49.234 --> 01:52.319
Um, I'm... I'm waiting for someone.

01:52.362 --> 01:55.489
Well, this is
a Neighborhood Watch block, so...

01:57.909 --> 02:00.035
- Come on, girl.

02:02.580 --> 02:04.498
Bitch that guards hell.

02:07.085 --> 02:08.585
Screw it.

02:26.896 --> 02:29.731
We are
genetically identical, or whatever.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.775
It's actually kinda cool.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.402
Um, as far as...

02:33.486 --> 02:35.320
Shit. Shit!

02:35.405 --> 02:36.780
So...

02:39.409 --> 02:41.160
Was there someone there?

02:44.289 --> 02:45.539
- Oh, my God!
- Freeze!

02:45.582 --> 02:46.623
What are you doing in my yard?

02:46.708 --> 02:48.083
Don't! Do not shoot me, please!

02:48.168 --> 02:49.168
- Why are you here?
- Do not shoot, please.

02:49.252 --> 02:50.669
- Hey, Alison. Alison.
- Okay.

02:52.714 --> 02:54.339
- Put it down.
- Get out of the way.

02:54.424 --> 02:55.841
He's with me.

02:55.925 --> 02:57.718
- Okay?
- Move!

02:59.179 --> 03:00.596
It's okay.

03:06.102 --> 03:07.519
--Oh, shit.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.271
You point a gun at my brother again

03:09.314 --> 03:11.481
I will kick the living shite out of you!

03:21.784 --> 03:23.076
We need to get my shit.

03:23.119 --> 03:24.286
What the hell were you doing here?

03:25.955 --> 03:28.123
Hey, you need this?

03:28.166 --> 03:30.918
You just broke the first rule of clone club.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.462
What? Never tell anyone about clone club?

03:35.340 --> 03:37.049
Hi.

03:37.133 --> 03:39.259
Uh, awkward. I'm Cosima.

03:41.346 --> 03:43.513
You have my number.

03:44.474 --> 03:47.309
You want answers, I want the briefcase.

03:48.603 --> 03:50.437
Seriously, it's life or death.

04:38.027 --> 04:39.486
You've got to be kidding me.

04:42.031 --> 04:43.699
Clones?

04:43.741 --> 04:45.659
Clones?

04:45.702 --> 04:47.369
They're not me. They're not.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.746
They're completely different people.

04:49.831 --> 04:51.456
"Soccer mum" Sarah.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.792
"Dreadlock science geek" Sarah.

04:53.876 --> 04:55.961
Arguably more attractive
than your "evil" Sarah.

04:56.045 --> 04:57.421
Yeah, I was there. Thank you.

04:57.505 --> 04:59.256
How can it be, though?

04:59.340 --> 05:01.258
What difference does it make, Fe?

05:01.342 --> 05:04.636
Last time I checked, human cloning was
illegal, let alone impossible.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.097
Yeah, leave it out, okay? it doesn't matter.

05:07.181 --> 05:08.724
It does matter!

05:08.766 --> 05:11.018
Dead Beth, dead German.

05:11.060 --> 05:14.521
Those two, three other Euros,
you, that's eight.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.648
And Dreadlocks is going on
about a blood sample

05:16.733 --> 05:19.276
saying it's life or death.
You can't just ignore it.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.361
Yes, I can.

05:21.904 --> 05:24.072
I'm just me, okay?

05:24.115 --> 05:25.324
The song remains the same.

05:25.408 --> 05:28.827
We get the 75 grand back
from Beth's partner, we get Kira,

05:28.911 --> 05:31.580
and we get as far away
from all this as possible.

05:41.799 --> 05:43.425
Am I going insane?

06:02.570 --> 06:05.697
Hey, Beth, thought you were still off.

06:05.782 --> 06:07.407
Uh, yeah. Just can't get enough.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.242
Um, is Art around?

06:09.285 --> 06:11.203
Beth, what the hell's going on?

06:12.121 --> 06:14.956
Uh, yeah.
I've gotta talk to you for a couple of seconds.

06:16.125 --> 06:17.751
Hey. Company?

06:17.794 --> 06:18.877
Yeah.

06:18.961 --> 06:21.129
Look, things are bad with Paul.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.799
- Okay.
- We're dividing up our shit.

06:23.883 --> 06:26.051
Any second he's gonna find
that joint account empty.

06:26.135 --> 06:29.513
Look, you get the cash
when you're back on active duty.

06:29.597 --> 06:30.764
That's the deal.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.766
Childs.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.643
- Sorry, just saying hello.
- No, you're not.

06:34.727 --> 06:36.019
Both of you.

06:43.027 --> 06:44.403
Bad news.

06:46.364 --> 06:48.073
You're reinstated.

06:48.157 --> 06:49.533
Holy shit.

06:50.201 --> 06:51.535
Welcome back.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.456
Well, thank God.

06:56.499 --> 06:59.376
Buckle up, kid. You got a 10-45.

07:03.965 --> 07:05.382
Uh... Hey.

07:05.466 --> 07:07.676
Two seconds.

07:12.473 --> 07:14.391
Shit.

07:20.731 --> 07:22.441
Do you want help with that?

07:22.567 --> 07:23.817
Yeah, you mind?

07:46.382 --> 07:47.716
Rory Road and Alister,

07:47.758 --> 07:51.219
confirmed 10-45. Forensic on site.

07:51.262 --> 07:53.513
So, Art, about our deal. I'm reinstated now...

07:53.556 --> 07:55.223
Hey, I'm not carrying around

07:55.266 --> 07:57.809
75 grand in the trunk, all right?

07:57.977 --> 07:59.436
Just call us in.

08:05.234 --> 08:07.611
Heading for the 10-45. Roger.

08:08.279 --> 08:10.030
Responder, please identify.

08:11.741 --> 08:13.283
Uh...

08:14.160 --> 08:15.744
55.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.663
55. Heading for the 10-45.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.582
Roger.

08:21.125 --> 08:23.752
- Out.
- Copy.

08:26.214 --> 08:27.506
What?

08:42.938 --> 08:44.564
Something wrong?

09:11.092 --> 09:13.385
- Body's chewed up pretty bad.

09:15.137 --> 09:16.805
What do you think?

09:16.847 --> 09:19.766
I think that some idiot didn't realize

09:19.809 --> 09:22.143
they were burying a body
next to an active quarry.

09:26.899 --> 09:29.109
Got a pretty good tire print over there.

09:29.151 --> 09:32.028
I'd say the body wasn't in the ground more
than two, maybe three days.

09:32.113 --> 09:34.531
Hey, welcome back.

09:36.742 --> 09:39.828
Now, this would be
your industrial sausage maker.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.038
Nice of them to lend a hand, though.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.001
Print?

09:46.335 --> 09:48.128
They better hit 'cause, uh...

09:48.170 --> 09:50.547
Reconstructing the face is gonna be tough.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.175
Hey!

09:54.260 --> 09:56.595
Can we get the guy to open this thing up?

09:57.388 --> 09:58.805
Uh...

09:58.848 --> 10:01.349
I need to, uh, make a call, yeah?

10:01.684 --> 10:02.767
One sec.

10:07.064 --> 10:09.441
I can't talk or meet. Just answer the question.

10:09.525 --> 10:11.526
Oh, okay, okay. Um...

10:11.569 --> 10:15.155
Our fingerprints
are close enough to flag a match, yeah.

10:15.197 --> 10:17.782
- Why?
- Beth's partner found the German.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.534
At least part of her.

10:19.577 --> 10:20.744
- Part of her?
- Yeah.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.203
Um, I messed up when I buried her.

10:22.288 --> 10:23.705
They have a fingerprint, Cosima.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.082
- Oh, wait, are you being Beth right now?
- Yes.

10:26.167 --> 10:29.628
Yes, I'm at the bloody crime scene
pretending to be a bloody cop.

10:29.712 --> 10:32.422
So I need to know if the bloody fingerprints
will flag a bloody match.

10:32.506 --> 10:35.592
Whoa. Okay, okay. Don't freak out.

10:35.676 --> 10:38.928
They need to use Interpol
to find the German, which is unlikely.

10:39.013 --> 10:42.057
But, um, if one of us
had a criminal record here...

10:45.478 --> 10:47.354
Do you have a criminal record?

10:47.688 --> 10:49.064
Just...

10:49.106 --> 10:50.899
Petty fraud, assault, whatever.

10:50.941 --> 10:52.275
Wasted youth, all right?

10:53.319 --> 10:57.906
If the body matches me, the cops will see a
mug shot of somebody who looks like Beth.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.367
Only, it's yours truly,
and I'm already supposed to be dead.

11:01.535 --> 11:03.787
Wow, wow. Welcome to the trip, man.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.246
That is not helpful.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.248
Yeah, okay, sorry. Just don't bolt.

11:07.291 --> 11:08.917
Okay, don't bolt.

11:09.001 --> 11:11.586
They can't run prints instantaneously,

11:11.629 --> 11:13.380
so we do have some time here.

11:13.422 --> 11:14.964
How much time?

11:15.049 --> 11:16.591
Bring me the briefcase and we'll talk.

11:17.218 --> 11:18.385
Okay?

11:22.264 --> 11:24.099
Beckwith will have
an exact time of death soon,

11:24.183 --> 11:26.309
but till then, I say we ballpark two, three days,

11:26.394 --> 11:27.977
see who's missing.

11:30.272 --> 11:31.815
And, uh, fingerprints?

11:31.899 --> 11:33.149
About a couple of days?

11:33.234 --> 11:36.111
Yeah, you know the lab. Hopefully overnight.

11:36.195 --> 11:38.488
Uh, look, Art, um, this shit with Paul

11:38.572 --> 11:40.156
is about to go sideways, okay?

11:40.241 --> 11:41.950
I need to get to the bank.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.618
Let me see your weapon.

11:44.412 --> 11:45.995
- Huh?
- Come on.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.789
Show it to me.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.298
It's empty.

11:57.341 --> 11:58.675
Yeah, well, we left in a hurry.

11:58.759 --> 11:59.884
You rode with me empty.

11:59.969 --> 12:02.512
Art, it's a 10-45 for legs.

12:02.596 --> 12:04.222
Right, Art?
Like, I mean, who am I gonna shoot?

12:04.306 --> 12:05.306
That's bullshit, Beth,

12:05.349 --> 12:07.350
for regs and your partner.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.269
Look, if this shooting has you trigger-shy,
Beth, you got...

12:09.311 --> 12:11.312
No, I'm not. I'm not. I'm not.

12:11.355 --> 12:13.732
Just give me an hour or two
to get up to speed, for Christ's sake.

12:13.816 --> 12:15.692
You can "get up to speed" on the desk, then.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.694
I'll work this with Deangelis.

12:17.778 --> 12:19.696
Now, get out of here.

12:19.947 --> 12:21.448
- Hey, Art...
- Look, if you ask me

12:21.490 --> 12:23.116
about that money one more time, Beth,

12:23.159 --> 12:25.952
I swear to God, it's going in the shredder.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.310
Hey.

12:57.234 --> 12:58.777
Don't worry, you get used to it.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.945
Two clones? Yeah, I'm not buying that.

13:02.656 --> 13:04.616
How many of us you need to meet, Sarah?

13:06.827 --> 13:08.828
Can I have the briefcase, please.

13:09.538 --> 13:11.206
I want some answers first.

13:11.540 --> 13:13.374
You know what?
The answers are in the briefcase.

13:14.835 --> 13:16.211
Let me guess,

13:16.253 --> 13:18.505
you're the smart one, you're the wild one.

13:18.547 --> 13:20.131
Would you believe we're clones?

13:21.467 --> 13:23.760
- Bourbon, rocks.
- You got it.

13:24.720 --> 13:27.180
So you're the scientist
the German talked about.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.974
Uh, yes. Well, PhD student, um...

13:30.059 --> 13:34.103
Uh, evolutionary developmental
biology at University of Minnesota.

13:34.188 --> 13:35.563
I'm heading back there tonight.

13:37.024 --> 13:39.317
The German was sick.
Should I be worried about that?

13:39.401 --> 13:42.904
Well, if you give me the case,
I'll know in a couple of weeks.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.906
Do you know who shot her in the head?

13:44.990 --> 13:47.909
Okay.

13:47.952 --> 13:51.079
So, six months ago, uh,

13:51.163 --> 13:53.581
Katja contacted Beth with this crazy story

13:53.666 --> 13:56.459
about her genetic identicals
being hunted in Europe.

13:56.544 --> 13:57.877
Hunted?

14:00.714 --> 14:02.173
Brilliant.

14:02.258 --> 14:03.591
I know.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.553
So, so, Beth used facial recognition software

14:06.595 --> 14:10.265
to find driver's licenses in North America.

14:10.349 --> 14:11.516
Two matches.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.977
- You and soccer bitch.
- Yes, right.

14:14.061 --> 14:16.604
But who is the original?

14:16.647 --> 14:19.440
Who's created us?

14:19.483 --> 14:20.942
Who's killing us?

14:21.277 --> 14:24.779
We need to know, but we lost our cop.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.281
So, however you managed
to get into her shoes,

14:26.323 --> 14:27.949
we really need you to stay there.

14:28.784 --> 14:30.660
Stay a cop to help you.

14:30.744 --> 14:32.453
To help us.

14:33.455 --> 14:35.123
Help us find out who's killing us.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.417
How? I'm not a cop.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.627
Beth's partner's gonna figure that out.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.964
Being Beth is what
got me into this mess in the first place.

14:43.048 --> 14:45.258
I know, I know. I get it, I get it.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.760
But you can't run away from her.

14:47.803 --> 14:50.763
Look, we are your biological imperative now.

14:51.056 --> 14:54.309
Okay? Katja's fingerprints
will match your fingerprints.

14:56.061 --> 14:59.147
So, get to Katja's
fingerprint results somehow.

14:59.189 --> 15:01.065
I think that's our only option.

15:04.194 --> 15:05.361
All right.

15:07.156 --> 15:08.823
Just answer me one thing.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.325
Anything, yes.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.328
If we're genetically identical,

15:15.164 --> 15:18.124
do you get that little patch of dry
skin between your eyebrows?

15:20.669 --> 15:21.753
That's good.

15:23.881 --> 15:25.715
Try to keep your sense of humor.

15:26.508 --> 15:28.301
Beth couldn't.

15:40.022 --> 15:41.522
No cream?

15:44.318 --> 15:47.820
Booked on the range,
day after tomorrow, 4:00.

15:47.863 --> 15:49.614
The range?

15:49.698 --> 15:51.074
The gun range.

15:51.158 --> 15:52.533
You with me or not?

15:52.618 --> 15:54.285
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.580
So, what about Jane Doe?

15:57.665 --> 16:00.667
Beckwith filled a bucket
with fragments from the hopper.

16:00.709 --> 16:02.210
Couple solids so far.

16:02.294 --> 16:05.672
Dyed red hair, like bright red.

16:05.714 --> 16:06.881
And laying out the skull fragments

16:06.966 --> 16:09.842
she's 99% sure she found
entry and exit wounds.

16:09.885 --> 16:11.219
Shooting.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.680
So, what about the prints?

16:13.889 --> 16:15.390
Start calling.

16:15.891 --> 16:18.559
And keep calling
while you clear that shit pile of a desk.

16:19.770 --> 16:22.897
Hey, sorry about
poaching your seat on this, eh?

16:22.982 --> 16:24.190
- He's all yours.

16:24.233 --> 16:25.608
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

16:28.737 --> 16:30.405
Detective Bell.

16:31.573 --> 16:33.574
Yeah, well, what can you tell me about her?

16:33.617 --> 16:35.201
Jane Doe.

16:35.744 --> 16:38.830
Hey, hey. Shh, shh.

16:38.914 --> 16:40.415
Uh, you...

16:40.499 --> 16:42.166
You want to give me that again?

16:43.210 --> 16:46.421
Am I speaking to your partner now, too, Art?

16:46.505 --> 16:49.924
Actually, we love voice change apps, so...

16:50.009 --> 16:52.176
The whole office is listening.

16:52.261 --> 16:55.054
She was just one of a few,

16:55.097 --> 16:57.306
unfit for family.

16:57.391 --> 16:58.599
Horse glue.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.685
So you didn't like her very much.

17:00.769 --> 17:02.353
How about you tell us her name?

17:02.980 --> 17:06.691
She expired at Allenside Park.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.028
Fuck.

17:11.238 --> 17:13.906
So, what, Stephen Hawking did it?

17:13.949 --> 17:16.784
No, no, no. The call came to me.

17:17.411 --> 17:20.204
"Just one of a few unfit for family."

17:20.289 --> 17:21.998
"Horse glue"? Shit.

17:22.082 --> 17:23.790
Art, what else did they say?

17:23.876 --> 17:26.919
They asked if I was the lead
on the "quarry body".

17:27.337 --> 17:28.503
Listen, before we go,

17:28.589 --> 17:30.465
- we'll check the desk to see who took the call.
- Yeah.

17:30.507 --> 17:32.133
Uh, you going to Allenside?

17:32.217 --> 17:36.012
Yeah. Check the log to see if there were any
shots fired down there.

17:36.096 --> 17:38.097
Okay, look, I'll see you in a bit. Okay?

18:04.500 --> 18:05.917
Hey...

18:06.668 --> 18:07.752
Raj.

18:09.171 --> 18:10.588
Detective.

18:11.006 --> 18:12.173
Beth.

18:12.216 --> 18:14.300
- Hi.
- Um,

18:14.343 --> 18:17.553
so you probably know
I've been off for a while.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.430
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.224
Uh, nightmare.

18:21.308 --> 18:22.809
PTSD,

18:23.393 --> 18:26.813
fatal civilian shooting, enquiry, medication,

18:26.855 --> 18:29.690
the whole enchilada.

18:30.067 --> 18:33.277
- Gum?
- Uh... Thanks.

18:34.905 --> 18:37.740
So, I guess you're back, then, right?

18:37.825 --> 18:39.367
Mmm, I'm benched.

18:39.451 --> 18:42.286
I'm trying to slip in without,
you know, a ripple,

18:42.788 --> 18:45.915
but on the down low,
I'm a little scattered, memory-wise.

18:47.876 --> 18:50.169
You think you could help me
with a few basics?

18:50.212 --> 18:52.130
Oh, like resetting your password?

18:52.214 --> 18:54.549
Yes, like that.

18:54.633 --> 18:57.552
And the whole procedure
for fingerprint results.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.263
I said an hour, Childs.

19:00.347 --> 19:01.889
- I haven't checked yet.
- They're in, though?

19:01.974 --> 19:03.724
'Cause I got a Jane Doe with zero leads.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.102
They're probably in my inbox. Just hang on.

19:06.186 --> 19:08.563
Yep, not a problem.

19:10.190 --> 19:13.568
- Childs...
- "Results from Central..." I'm helping you out.

19:15.737 --> 19:17.196
I gotta log those.

19:17.906 --> 19:19.448
--It's all good.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.742
Nothing, anyway.

19:21.785 --> 19:23.119
Don't do that again, Childs.

19:23.203 --> 19:25.621
I don't know, Art.
You think someone's jerking your chain?

19:35.465 --> 19:37.258
- Auto glass.
- Hmm.

19:37.342 --> 19:39.969
Looks like a fast exit that way.

19:40.053 --> 19:41.596
I don't see any casings.

19:44.099 --> 19:45.766
Could be line of fire.

19:46.518 --> 19:48.102
- The range.
- Hmm.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.574
I've seen her elaborate
ruses and guises before,

20:01.617 --> 20:03.326
but how do you do this?

20:03.410 --> 20:06.287
How do you fake
your own demise beneath a train?

20:06.330 --> 20:08.122
Wouldn't you rather know why?

20:08.165 --> 20:09.498
I don't care to know why.

20:10.292 --> 20:14.003
Because I saw a way
to dump Vic and get out of that life.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.088
And get away with Kira.

20:17.424 --> 20:20.134
Take her on the run with you. Brilliant.

20:21.637 --> 20:24.138
New clothes and a Jaguar
do not a mother make.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.432
The other point.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.104
I don't remember.

20:32.731 --> 20:33.981
Buffleheads.

20:34.483 --> 20:36.108
Barrow's goldeneye.

20:36.485 --> 20:38.402
Just passing through.

20:43.533 --> 20:45.243
I'll set up a visit.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.829
But the only way you will
regain custody of Kira

20:48.914 --> 20:51.749
is to show me that you can be still.

20:56.838 --> 20:58.839
You're not her legal guardian.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.007
Mine either, anymore.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.842
You can visit any other approach

21:01.927 --> 21:03.719
and I will stop lying
to Social Services for you.

21:03.804 --> 21:05.179
You wouldn't do that to Kira.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.848
No. I'd do it to you.

21:23.365 --> 21:26.200
Hey, someone cleared this out.
Laid down in here.

21:26.410 --> 21:27.868
Around here? Probably homeless.

21:27.953 --> 21:30.871
Yeah. But someone moved this into position.

21:32.499 --> 21:34.041
Hey, this look like a blind to you?

21:34.084 --> 21:36.919
A log for someone to lay a rifle on?

21:37.838 --> 21:39.547
Weeds knocked down for sightlines.

21:40.465 --> 21:41.674
Where are you?

21:41.717 --> 21:43.301
Um, back at school.

21:43.385 --> 21:47.388
What? School? What?
Oh, shit, right. Right, right, right.

21:47.514 --> 21:49.056
Minneapolis, shit.

21:49.683 --> 21:50.808
Uh, what's going on?

21:50.892 --> 21:54.061
Well, I managed to scrap the
fingerprint results for a while anyway.

21:54.104 --> 21:57.106
But the killer contacted Art, Cosima.

21:57.190 --> 21:59.734
He's already at the scene
where Katja was shot.

21:59.776 --> 22:02.528
Okay, that's good. Just... Just stick with him.

22:02.571 --> 22:06.449
I can't. He's...
He's benched me because I'm bloody useless.

22:06.533 --> 22:08.284
I need help, Cosima.

22:08.368 --> 22:10.953
He wants me on the range tomorrow.
I've never even fired a gun.

22:11.121 --> 22:14.665
All right. Well, just hold tight, we know
somebody who can help with that.

22:15.042 --> 22:16.959
- You serious?
- If you are.

22:18.253 --> 22:20.254
You know we got
a motorcycle tread over here, Art.

22:20.297 --> 22:21.422
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

22:22.257 --> 22:24.467
Yeah, it's a good print,
could be the shooter's getaway.

22:24.593 --> 22:26.761
Yeah, but a long gun on a motorcycle.

22:26.845 --> 22:28.763
Could be the weapon broke down, right?

22:29.222 --> 22:30.389
Yeah, it could be.

22:34.394 --> 22:35.895
Hey, I got something over here.

22:46.281 --> 22:47.281
Headshot.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.120
Bright red hair.

23:00.587 --> 23:02.463
It has to be this morning.

23:02.547 --> 23:06.425
Art's got me chasing down
motorcycle models from tire tracks,

23:06.468 --> 23:10.096
and I'm shooting
bloody targets at a gun range tomorrow.

23:10.222 --> 23:14.100
Well, I can't just conjure a sitter out of thin
air. it's weekend primetime, Sarah.

23:14.309 --> 23:16.310
- Well, then we're all screwed.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.395
Aren't we?

23:18.355 --> 23:19.855
Donnie...

23:21.900 --> 23:24.568
Can you watch the kids
for a couple of hours today?

23:24.653 --> 23:25.903
- Golf.
- Give it.

23:26.530 --> 23:29.156
- On television?
- No, I have a tee time, remember?

23:32.035 --> 23:34.412
I'm sorry,
I'm coming up empty.

23:38.708 --> 23:40.084
I may have a solution.

23:44.506 --> 23:46.757
Gemma, Oscar, this is Felix.

23:48.802 --> 23:49.844
Hello.

23:53.974 --> 23:57.393
- Brilliant.
- So, I'm going out for a couple of hours.

23:57.477 --> 23:59.061
So you be good.

23:59.646 --> 24:02.022
Mommy's gonna be very upset. Okay?

24:03.400 --> 24:04.400
Same goes for you.

24:07.028 --> 24:09.530
So, what now?

24:13.285 --> 24:14.910
Does your daddy have a drinks trolley?

24:15.162 --> 24:16.162
What's that?

24:16.830 --> 24:17.830
Don't worry, I'll find it.

24:20.167 --> 24:21.208
You.

24:21.877 --> 24:24.211
- You want to dress up like a little girl?
- No.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.172
Well, I don't have anything for you then.

24:26.214 --> 24:27.715
I'll dress up like a boy.

24:28.425 --> 24:29.425
We can work with that.

24:30.594 --> 24:33.554
No, the make and model
matched the tread that Deangelis sent you.

24:33.597 --> 24:36.390
A sports bike Suzuki SV650.

24:37.058 --> 24:40.519
Oh, black tank, custom pipes,
and stolen when?

24:40.645 --> 24:42.062
Uh, reported four days ago.

24:42.814 --> 24:44.899
I... I should probably
get back to my real job now.

24:44.983 --> 24:49.069
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, just put out a...
You know...

24:49.112 --> 24:52.907
- An APB.
- Yes. Yes, ASAP.

24:52.949 --> 24:55.701
Um, sorry, I'm at the doctor.
My phone's about to die.

24:56.077 --> 24:57.495
Okay. I'll get someone to do it.

24:57.579 --> 24:58.704
Thanks, Raj.

25:03.627 --> 25:04.627
Well, go.

25:15.430 --> 25:17.431
Okay, reload, try again.

25:18.850 --> 25:21.769
So most city cops carry Glocks,

25:21.853 --> 25:25.022
but a Walther P99,
it has an optional-sized handgrip.

25:25.106 --> 25:26.857
It's good for women, Beth said.

25:27.734 --> 25:30.945
Particularly women
living their lives like rats in a lab.

25:32.948 --> 25:33.948
Is that what you think?

25:34.032 --> 25:35.282
Well, what else could it be?

25:36.451 --> 25:39.745
Someone is covering up
their illegal experiments by wiping us out.

25:41.581 --> 25:42.581
Well, whatever it is,

25:44.167 --> 25:47.294
I need to protect my family.
So Beth taught me how to shoot.

25:49.005 --> 25:50.130
For that I'm grateful to her.

25:52.133 --> 25:53.133
I'm sorry you lost her.

25:54.844 --> 25:57.763
Uh, but anything you can
tell me about her will help.

25:58.265 --> 25:59.306
Well...

25:59.391 --> 26:02.142
I fail to see
how someone like you can fill Beth's shoes.

26:03.478 --> 26:04.937
Truth is I barely knew Beth.

26:05.855 --> 26:08.607
She was all business but I admired her,

26:08.650 --> 26:10.192
she didn't cry, she was discreet,

26:10.277 --> 26:12.152
she didn't bring
her foster brother to my house.

26:12.237 --> 26:14.113
I didn't know the rules of clone club, did I?

26:14.155 --> 26:15.239
Can you not use the c-word?

26:16.283 --> 26:17.283
Please?

26:28.670 --> 26:29.670
Shit.

26:32.173 --> 26:33.549
Stop here. I'll walk the rest.

26:36.678 --> 26:37.761
So my bottom line

26:38.888 --> 26:41.181
is my children can't know
their mother is a freak.

26:42.225 --> 26:43.892
Things have to stay on a need-to-know basis.

26:43.977 --> 26:45.769
- Yeah, I'm fine with that.
- Good.

26:47.564 --> 26:51.525
- So, we made a decision to trust you.
- Really?

26:51.568 --> 26:55.321
Sarah, this is my life now,
and I'm doing the best I can.

26:58.033 --> 27:03.203
So Beth had,
um, a substantial sum, sort of a fund,

27:03.288 --> 27:05.456
she used to buy information
we couldn't get officially.

27:06.374 --> 27:07.416
Okay.

27:08.084 --> 27:11.754
We were a cop, a scientist and myself.

27:12.881 --> 27:14.298
The fund was how I could contribute.

27:15.216 --> 27:17.426
- How much?
- 75,000.

27:19.179 --> 27:20.304
You could rob me blind.

27:21.514 --> 27:23.557
But we're hoping you realize
you can't run away from this.

27:27.854 --> 27:29.730
So can you con her bank or not?

27:36.404 --> 27:37.571
Good.

27:49.459 --> 27:50.751
Oh, Gemma!

27:51.378 --> 27:54.088
Look, Mom, we're cross-dressers.

27:54.130 --> 27:56.298
- No, you are not.
- I'm you.

27:56.383 --> 27:58.133
Oh, you're back.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.303
- Felix.
- Don't go!

28:01.388 --> 28:03.472
Can Felix stay the night, Mom?

28:03.556 --> 28:04.598
No.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.558
My work here is done, I'm afraid.

28:06.601 --> 28:08.227
- No!
- Stay, Felix.

28:08.269 --> 28:09.770
Adios, dragsters!

28:13.233 --> 28:18.028
- Wow. Okay, so the money belongs to Alison.
- Mmm-hmm.

28:18.113 --> 28:20.155
Well, so what're you gonna do now?

28:20.240 --> 28:22.491
Gonna rip off your new sis
and abscond with Kira?

28:22.575 --> 28:26.078
She's not my sister and, yeah,
that's exactly what we do.

28:26.871 --> 28:28.288
- Well...

28:28.373 --> 28:30.290
- Shit.
- Hide!

28:30.333 --> 28:32.292
You cannot hide in minimalist furniture!

28:32.335 --> 28:33.419
Go.

28:34.003 --> 28:35.170
Shit.

28:36.965 --> 28:38.674
You're not
supposed to be here.

28:38.758 --> 28:40.426
Nice.

28:40.468 --> 28:44.346
You were staying at Cody's
for a while. I think that's a good idea.

28:44.431 --> 28:45.973
Well, I think you're being a bitch.

28:46.015 --> 28:48.559
I'm the bigger person here,
I need a change of clothes.

28:49.644 --> 28:52.146
Uh, I... I've been reinstated, Paul.

28:54.190 --> 28:55.357
- Hey.
- Oh.

28:56.693 --> 28:58.152
Well, how do you feel about that?

28:59.362 --> 29:00.529
What? Are you painting by numbers?

29:00.989 --> 29:02.114
I guess I am.

29:04.075 --> 29:06.285
Okay, I'm sorry I'm like this, Paul.

29:07.495 --> 29:10.164
- Uh...
- You're not like this, Beth, it's your job.

29:10.248 --> 29:12.833
Yeah, but I'm a cop first, Paul, but... Shit.

29:14.210 --> 29:15.461
How would you like it if I start pulling

29:15.503 --> 29:17.421
this schizophrenic hot-and-cold crap on you?

29:18.548 --> 29:20.007
Maybe you should, Paul.

29:21.092 --> 29:23.260
I mean, seriously,
where are we going with this?

30:13.061 --> 30:14.144
Sorry.

30:15.355 --> 30:16.438
Gotta go.

30:30.870 --> 30:36.083
Oh, my God! Oh!

30:36.209 --> 30:38.836
She doesn't want to break up
with big-dick Paul.

30:38.920 --> 30:43.257
She smells it in her musk.
You are stuffed.

30:43.299 --> 30:45.634
--Oh, holy shit.

30:45.718 --> 30:47.845
Oh, don't worry, I bet he's wanking already.

30:47.929 --> 30:49.179
Oh, he'd better be.

30:49.264 --> 30:51.431
Paul will so be.

30:51.516 --> 30:53.392
- No, no, no, no.
- No.

30:54.853 --> 30:58.939
Eye on the prize, okay.
Get the money back from Beth's other partner.

30:59.566 --> 31:01.859
- Get out.
- Yeah.

31:10.952 --> 31:12.661
Maybe it's a lady grip Walther.

31:12.745 --> 31:14.621
You like your big Glock, don't you?

31:17.000 --> 31:21.545
So, um, two sets
of tire tracks at the crime scene?

31:21.629 --> 31:23.380
One motorcycle and one car?

31:23.464 --> 31:25.883
Yeah, but there had to be three people there.

31:25.967 --> 31:28.510
So, if the killer's on a motorcycle, then what?

31:28.595 --> 31:31.054
He has an accomplice,
drives the vic to the quarry?

31:31.139 --> 31:36.977
Or the vic has a driver, doesn't go to police,
panics, and half-ass buries the body?

31:37.979 --> 31:41.773
Yeah, the, um, body dump
doesn't match the professional hit.

31:42.150 --> 31:43.150
Exactly.

31:43.985 --> 31:46.194
And I got something else
for you, Beth, you're gonna love this.

31:48.489 --> 31:50.073
That was in the sniper's nest.

31:51.451 --> 31:52.534
Yeah.

31:52.619 --> 31:54.161
We got a live one.

31:54.245 --> 31:58.081
Phone calls, leaving clues, messing with us.

31:58.291 --> 31:59.416
- Resetting!

32:01.085 --> 32:02.836
Weapons down, please!

32:03.171 --> 32:04.338
Detective Childs.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.674
All right, yeah, Suzuki?

32:09.719 --> 32:11.094
Okay, hang on a sec.

32:11.930 --> 32:12.930
All clear!

32:13.431 --> 32:15.390
- Okay, thanks.

32:16.100 --> 32:18.810
Patrol's spotted my stolen
Suzuki down at Parkdale.

32:19.520 --> 32:20.604
It's a long shot.

32:21.481 --> 32:23.231
We may as well see if the tires match.

32:30.907 --> 32:33.158
Is this the stolen sport bike?

32:33.201 --> 32:34.660
Yeah, it looks like it.

32:36.287 --> 32:37.579
Well, let's find the super.

32:41.709 --> 32:43.168
My son? My son?

32:43.252 --> 32:44.711
Yeah, I... I know, he's not home,

32:44.754 --> 32:48.632
but, um, the motorcycle,
does it belong to a renter?

32:48.716 --> 32:52.135
Upstair? My son no here. No. No.

32:52.220 --> 32:53.303
Thank you.

32:54.430 --> 32:55.430
Thought you were the one supposed to deal

32:55.515 --> 32:56.974
with the non-English speaking majority.

32:57.642 --> 32:59.643
Uh, yeah, my Ukrainian sucks.

33:13.449 --> 33:14.491
Easy access.

33:28.381 --> 33:29.423
Motorcycle clothes.

33:35.263 --> 33:36.388
It's open.

34:11.466 --> 34:12.466
What you got there?

34:13.967 --> 34:15.010
Uh...

34:16.471 --> 34:18.597
"You formed my inward parts,

34:18.639 --> 34:21.308
"You knitted me together in my..."
"...mother's womb.

34:21.350 --> 34:24.770
"I praise you
for I am fearfully and wonderfully made."

34:26.147 --> 34:27.481
Bibles, dolls.

34:27.940 --> 34:30.150
This perp's got some
deep-seated spiritual problems.

34:42.663 --> 34:43.663
Go!

34:43.998 --> 34:45.665
- No. No.
- I'm okay. Go!

34:46.458 --> 34:47.751
Go after him! Go!

34:56.511 --> 34:57.552
Shit.

35:00.598 --> 35:01.973
Freeze! Police!

35:04.477 --> 35:05.602
Shit.

35:37.593 --> 35:39.302
Shots fired!

35:39.387 --> 35:44.766
780 Bane. Bane and Heward.
Foot pursuit in progress.

35:59.740 --> 36:01.658
- Art.
- Where are you?

36:01.742 --> 36:07.330
Uh, I think he went west,
uh, between the two, uh, the row houses.

36:07.415 --> 36:10.167
Uh, I think he went
into one of the abandoned buildings here.

36:12.170 --> 36:19.634
Beth!

36:19.886 --> 36:21.052
No!

36:32.815 --> 36:34.733
Good riddance.

36:34.775 --> 36:36.610
Elizabeth Childs.

36:36.694 --> 36:38.445
I'm not Beth!

36:55.421 --> 36:58.048
Dirty little copy cop.

36:59.300 --> 37:00.300
Who are you?

37:20.821 --> 37:23.657
Not yet. Not Beth.

37:33.417 --> 37:34.417
Beth!

37:39.548 --> 37:40.548
Beth!

37:41.175 --> 37:42.509
Jesus Christ!

37:47.390 --> 37:48.682
Are you okay?

37:48.724 --> 37:49.891
Hey.

37:49.976 --> 37:51.101
I'm fine. I'm fine.

37:52.019 --> 37:53.061
Where'd he go?

37:54.689 --> 37:57.190
Okay. Okay, I got you.

37:58.192 --> 37:59.401
I got you, come on.

38:12.290 --> 38:13.832
All I saw was a hoodie.

38:14.709 --> 38:16.418
He hit me from behind.

38:16.502 --> 38:18.086
And you struggled with him
at close quarters?

38:18.462 --> 38:20.255
Yeah, I was almost out, I never saw his face.

38:20.339 --> 38:21.339
Lieutenant.

38:22.383 --> 38:24.134
I almost lost not one but two detectives.

38:24.218 --> 38:25.969
How the hell are you in this
without backup, Art?

38:26.053 --> 38:27.887
It was a thread, Lieutenant.

38:27.930 --> 38:29.723
It was a flimsy lead on a stolen bike.

38:29.765 --> 38:30.849
Well, it sure hit.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.185
- You sure you're all right?
- I'm fine.

38:35.730 --> 38:37.230
Just let me take her home.

38:39.066 --> 38:40.650
I never should have told you to go after him.

38:41.819 --> 38:44.237
Of course I'm gonna go after him, Art.
It's not your fault.

38:45.072 --> 38:46.781
No, no, I should have had your back.

38:48.075 --> 38:50.327
You had mine. I didn't have yours.

38:50.411 --> 38:53.997
Yes, you did. Look, shit happens fast, okay?

38:54.081 --> 38:58.793
Will you please... I'm not gonna let you drive
me home like an invalid, okay?

38:58.878 --> 39:03.048
I just need a shower
and an early start so we can catch this guy.

39:03.758 --> 39:04.758
- Okay?
- Hey.

39:13.768 --> 39:14.893
Your money's all there.

39:17.605 --> 39:19.272
You did have it in the trunk.

39:21.025 --> 39:22.067
Sorry I held it over you.

39:23.277 --> 39:24.611
Guess I owe you one.

39:25.613 --> 39:26.654
No, we're square.

39:28.949 --> 39:30.283
Hey, you're not gonna hug me, are you?

39:34.163 --> 39:35.246
See you in the morning.

39:59.605 --> 40:00.605
Are you sure about this?

40:01.482 --> 40:03.149
Yeah.

41:01.959 --> 41:05.503
Bloody Mrs. S. She's right.

41:06.130 --> 41:07.255
Really?

41:09.258 --> 41:11.551
What kind of mother am I
if I snatch my own daughter?

41:12.261 --> 41:13.928
A crap one. I agree.

41:16.640 --> 41:17.765
And if I rob Alison?

41:20.060 --> 41:22.020
- Run now and never tell my...
- Clones?

41:22.855 --> 41:25.064
Oh, God, we do have to find
another word for that.

41:25.149 --> 41:27.567
Don't tell them what, Sarah? What happened?

41:30.571 --> 41:34.324
After all this? Really gonna go
and just give the money back to bitchface?

41:34.408 --> 41:36.242
Mrs. S gave me one visit.

41:38.412 --> 41:39.537
I need to get it right.

41:42.416 --> 41:46.127
Okay.
Well, this has taken years off my life.

41:47.254 --> 41:52.800
Now can you please tell me what in the hell
happened to your face?

42:40.808 --> 42:41.808
Detective Childs.

42:41.850 --> 42:43.142
No, you're not.

42:43.185 --> 42:45.603
Can you tell me
what the angry angel looked like?

42:47.231 --> 42:49.148
Beth probably shot
Maggie Chen on purpose.

42:49.233 --> 42:51.067
She never told us anything about this.

42:51.193 --> 42:53.152
We need to spend some time together.

42:53.195 --> 42:55.363
Figure out what's suddenly going on with us.

42:55.447 --> 42:56.864
Sarah needs your help with her daughter.

42:56.949 --> 42:57.991
You're not my mother.

42:58.367 --> 43:00.159
It's not about revenge.

43:00.244 --> 43:02.287
She was here. She was Beth.

43:02.329 --> 43:05.999
She's gonna get us both busted
unless I meet her. Alone.
