WEBVTT

00:15.149 --> 00:16.484
Previously on Blunt Talk.

00:16.584 --> 00:19.787
I want you to get
an exclusive jailhouse
interview with Adler.

00:19.887 --> 00:23.224
Is it my destiny
to die alone, Harry?

00:23.324 --> 00:25.059
Not as long
as I'm around, Major.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.761
Oh, Martin,
I miss you.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.563
I have a crush
on you, Shelly.

00:29.663 --> 00:31.099
Please don't hate me.
Drop it.

00:31.199 --> 00:32.466
Are you really asking me

00:32.566 --> 00:35.603
to choose between you
and Sylvia, Major?

00:35.703 --> 00:37.638
I told you, Evelyn,
I'm not a prostitute.

00:37.738 --> 00:40.274
You are now.
No, I'm not.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.276
I know you miss Harry
and I'm trying to make

00:42.376 --> 00:44.178
everything feel
as familiar as possible.

00:44.278 --> 00:45.513
You're very kind.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.215
What is that I'm feeling?

00:47.315 --> 00:49.250
My brass knuckle.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.599
Top of the ninth,
three outs.

01:05.699 --> 01:08.001
Herschel's pitched
an almost perfect game.

01:08.136 --> 01:11.439
The real World Series.
America versus Britain.

01:11.539 --> 01:14.208
The evil empire--
Herschel, get on with it!

01:14.308 --> 01:16.844
Uh, all right.

01:22.150 --> 01:23.284
Oh!

01:23.884 --> 01:27.255
Herschel, I asked you
to use the proper action.

01:27.355 --> 01:28.589
I don't have
any control that way.

01:28.689 --> 01:30.391
You don't have
any control this way.

01:30.491 --> 01:33.327
Fine, do it your way.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.496
Old grumpy-ass British.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.598
All right.

01:41.469 --> 01:44.772
Oh! Damn it, Herschel!

01:44.872 --> 01:47.175
You know what?
I'm sorry I'm not
as good as Harry.

01:47.208 --> 01:49.343
You know
I'm American, right?
Oh, is that an excuse?

01:49.443 --> 01:51.745
Well, we need to be playing
a real sport like basketball.

01:51.845 --> 01:53.581
Basketball's
a game for girls.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.183
You would know.

01:55.216 --> 01:57.017
If you hadn't fallen
in love with Georgette,

01:57.185 --> 01:58.686
we wouldn't be here.
Wouldn't have to--

01:58.786 --> 02:00.488
Will you stop
reminding me of that?

02:00.588 --> 02:03.757
Here I am trying to forget
and you keep talking about
it all the time.

02:03.857 --> 02:06.194
Now here's another day wasted.

02:06.227 --> 02:08.296
Well, maybe you don't
try hard enough.

02:08.396 --> 02:11.899
If you can't forget,
why don't you try and
pretend to forget?

02:11.999 --> 02:14.802
How can anybody
pretend to forget?

02:14.902 --> 02:18.071
Well, I know if it was me,
I'd sit down and-- and relax.

02:18.206 --> 02:21.742
I'd close my eyes
and I'd concentrate
and I'd think of nothing.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.711
Wouldn't be long then.
That's what I'd do.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.890
Oh, wow.

02:39.427 --> 02:41.862
Mmm. Mmm.

02:49.403 --> 02:52.306
Oh, no!

02:57.010 --> 02:59.313
Excellent reflexes,
Herschel.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.315
What, are you Henry VIII?

03:01.415 --> 03:04.117
You almost took my head off
and we haven't even discussed
benefits.

03:04.318 --> 03:06.587
Walter!
Shelly.

03:06.687 --> 03:09.623
What are you doing here?
You haven't been answering
your phone.

03:09.723 --> 03:12.092
What's up, girl?
Hi.

03:12.260 --> 03:15.263
Herschel, you forgot
to charge my phone again.

03:15.363 --> 03:17.130
Walter, I'm sorry, okay?

03:17.265 --> 03:19.099
Uh, I'm not good
at this servant stuff.

03:19.267 --> 03:21.635
My mother waited on me
hand and foot for 36 years

03:21.735 --> 03:23.170
until she couldn't
take it anymore.

03:23.271 --> 03:25.706
I hate myself!
Stop it.
You're doing fine.

03:25.806 --> 03:28.141
You keep
the house very clean.
I'm supposed to clean?

03:28.276 --> 03:31.679
Walter, I'm here because
I discovered something
about Duncan Adler.

03:31.779 --> 03:36.517
Oh, uh, that's right.
I have that damned interview
at the jail today.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.319
Yeah, but check this out.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.921
Duncan Adler has been writing
letters to the LA Times

03:41.021 --> 03:43.123
for years accusing
Rudolph Global

03:43.291 --> 03:46.159
of cock-blocking water
recycling in Los Angeles.

03:46.294 --> 03:49.297
Now, that
is very interesting.
Yeah.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.699
Yo, speaking
of cock-block, if you can
give us a moment, Walter.

03:51.799 --> 03:54.101
- Shelly-shell.
- Herschel.

03:54.368 --> 03:55.503
Harry?

03:56.637 --> 03:58.939
What are you doing?

03:59.039 --> 04:02.543
You have to let Walter go.
He has Herschel now.

04:02.643 --> 04:05.313
I am trying, Sylvia.
Are you?

04:05.379 --> 04:08.416
How many times have you snuck
over there to dust and vacuum?

04:08.516 --> 04:11.919
I don't think that's trying.
I'm not a faucet, Sylvia.

04:12.019 --> 04:14.121
I can't just turn off
my heart like that.

04:14.322 --> 04:16.790
I know, Harry.

04:18.125 --> 04:20.160
It's just hard
when you're a girl.

04:20.328 --> 04:22.430
You want to be number one
in your man's life.

04:22.530 --> 04:25.833
Hey, you are number one.

04:29.737 --> 04:30.871
What have you got
there, darling?

04:30.971 --> 04:33.040
I'm off the waiting list
at Tisch.

04:33.140 --> 04:35.509
I got into the film school.
What?

04:35.609 --> 04:38.746
Well, this is amazing!
You see?

04:38.846 --> 04:41.349
And you'd given up hope.
Yeah.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.851
I'm finally going straight.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.919
But it means
moving to New York.

04:47.921 --> 04:50.424
Will you come with me?

04:55.363 --> 04:57.565
New York?

05:04.838 --> 05:07.841
Oh, thank you.
Mm-hmm.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.546
Any mail for me,
sunshine?

05:12.646 --> 05:14.548
Nothing.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.517
But I like
your Steve Jobs look.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.218
Very Michael Fassbender.

05:18.386 --> 05:20.721
Have you seen Shame?
He's enormous.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.856
Really?
Didn't seem
that big to me.

05:27.961 --> 05:30.464
Good morning, Mr. Stone.

05:30.564 --> 05:31.799
Good morning to you.

05:31.899 --> 05:34.702
Or Morgen
as they say in Munich.

05:34.802 --> 05:37.104
Oh.

05:37.405 --> 05:39.473
Mm-mmm.

05:44.478 --> 05:45.513
Good morning, Jim.

05:45.613 --> 05:47.881
Morning, coworker.

06:09.970 --> 06:13.874
Walter will be here
any minute.

06:13.974 --> 06:16.910
Did you all see
this memo from HR

06:17.010 --> 06:21.014
about not smoking
marijuana on the premises?

06:21.114 --> 06:23.884
I heard that the new head
of HR only has one testicle.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.686
I heard the same thing.

06:25.786 --> 06:28.188
Hitler only had one ball.

06:28.456 --> 06:30.023
Okay.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.629
Oh, I love that song.
I'll start again.

06:35.729 --> 06:36.997
Join me.
Okay.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.084
Morning, everyone.

06:57.184 --> 06:59.487
Morning.
Good morning, everyone.

06:59.587 --> 07:02.055
Wait in my office, Herschel.
Thank you.
Oh. Yes, Walter.

07:02.155 --> 07:04.391
Do you need anything?
Some coffee? A corn dog?

07:04.492 --> 07:07.695
Ooh, maybe a scoop
of avocado with a little
salt and olive oil.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.963
No, I'm fine, thank you.
Okay.

07:10.063 --> 07:13.200
Actually, the avocado
sounds good.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.935
Ooh, all right.
I'll be right on it.

07:15.035 --> 07:17.037
Just got to find
an avocado,

07:17.137 --> 07:18.672
salt, and oil.

07:18.772 --> 07:19.973
Have you heard
from Harry?

07:20.073 --> 07:21.909
Martin,
I've told you before,

07:22.009 --> 07:23.777
I don't want
to talk about that.

07:23.877 --> 07:26.880
So, Shelly came
to my house this morning

07:26.980 --> 07:31.351
and she told me some
very interesting things
about our Duncan Adler.

07:31.519 --> 07:34.988
Walter, you know we leave
for the jail in 45 minutes?

07:35.088 --> 07:37.691
Yes, and I am very keen
to speak with Mr. Adler,

07:37.791 --> 07:40.027
pick his brain
about Rudolph Global.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.229
So, Shelly, fill them in
on your research.

07:42.329 --> 07:44.097
Okay, so what I discovered
last night--

07:44.197 --> 07:46.600
I was here, too.
Yeah.

07:46.700 --> 07:49.837
What I discovered
last night was that
Duncan Adler has been linking

07:49.937 --> 07:53.841
Rudolph Global to the killing
of LA's recycled water plant
in 2001.

07:53.941 --> 07:55.108
How did they kill it?

07:55.208 --> 07:56.544
With a smear campaign

07:56.644 --> 07:58.411
funded by one of their
shell corporations.

07:58.546 --> 08:00.380
They labeled it
"Toilet to Tap."

08:00.548 --> 08:02.816
But they could have
gone with "Ass to Glass"

08:02.916 --> 08:05.686
or "Fanny to Faucet"
or "Shitta to Brita."

08:05.786 --> 08:08.989
Yeah, or if we were in Israel,
they could have gone with
"Tuchus to Tonsils."

08:09.089 --> 08:11.825
That's enough, Jim.
Anyway, there's
a vote coming up--

08:11.925 --> 08:14.427
Proposition 68-- to try
to reopen the plant.

08:14.562 --> 08:18.799
So the question is,
why are they against
recycled water

08:18.899 --> 08:20.267
when LA so clearly
needs it?

08:20.367 --> 08:23.436
Well, I made contact with
Margaret Rudolph last night

08:23.571 --> 08:24.938
and I will see
where that leads.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.574
In the meantime,
I think we should have

08:26.640 --> 08:30.578
an expert on tomorrow night
to discuss recycled water.

08:30.644 --> 08:31.745
A hydrologist?
Mm-hmm.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.480
Yeah, let me
handle this, Walter.
Great.

08:33.581 --> 08:35.916
Jim and Martin,
work on the Middle East
package for tonight.

08:36.016 --> 08:39.687
And Rosalie, Shelly,
and I will go to jail.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.591
Herschel,
what's the meaning of this?

08:51.799 --> 08:53.701
Martin, can you
come here, please?

08:53.801 --> 08:56.604
I'd like to talk to you
about the tech segment
on the Japanese robots.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.471
Oh, oh, what's wrong
with my segment?

08:58.606 --> 09:00.173
I told my mother
it would be on.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.610
Oh, no, no, it's fine.
We'll run it tonight.

09:05.779 --> 09:07.681
Does Jim seem different
to you today?

09:07.781 --> 09:09.617
He does.
It's mysterious.

09:09.650 --> 09:12.052
It might be the turtleneck,
but I feel drawn to him.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.688
Me, too.
Really? Does this mean
the break is over?

09:14.788 --> 09:17.157
I could update
the Jimelia Twitter account.
We've plateaued.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.960
I don't know
if the break is over.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.730
Please don't say
anything to anyone.

09:22.830 --> 09:25.132
Okay, Celia, okay.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.300
I'm very discreet.
You should know that.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.737
Like, do you know
where I live?
No, I don't.

09:29.837 --> 09:32.039
See, very discreet.

09:32.139 --> 09:34.041
Also, you've never
asked me,

09:34.141 --> 09:38.045
which, now that
I think about it,
hurts very much.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.147
Oh, Martin, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.883
It's okay.
I think I'm just having
my male period.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.484
I've been very
emotional all day.

09:44.652 --> 09:46.286
God, you must be in synch
with me and Shelly.

09:46.386 --> 09:48.689
We're also shedding
our linings. Aw.

09:48.789 --> 09:51.158
That makes
so much sense.

09:52.660 --> 09:55.095
The first thing we'll do
is shoot some footage

09:55.195 --> 09:58.165
to get a sense of Duncan's
life here in jail.

09:58.265 --> 10:01.902
What are you thinking?
He's initiated a drama group.

10:02.002 --> 10:03.971
The Oscar Wildes.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.639
So we'll film him
doing that,

10:05.739 --> 10:08.241
then we'll have
the actual sit-down.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.680
Let's get the reunion
for the B-roll.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.147
Walter.

10:14.247 --> 10:16.216
It's been months
since I kidnapped you.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.085
Mr. Adler, I-- uh.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.654
I'm so sorry that
I abducted you,

10:20.754 --> 10:23.523
but is there any chance
that you could get UBS
to drop all charges?

10:23.623 --> 10:26.026
I'm losing my mind in here.
I haven't even gone
to trial yet.

10:26.126 --> 10:29.462
Mr. Adler, there's nothing
I can do about that.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.799
Mr. Adler.
Yes?

10:31.899 --> 10:33.834
You can let go
of Walter now.

10:35.202 --> 10:36.670
Oh, sorry.
Damn it. Sorry.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.571
I always hold on
too long during hugs.

10:38.672 --> 10:41.174
It's like I'm tone deaf
when it comes to
physical space.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.276
Actually, Walter,
can you guys hug again?

10:43.376 --> 10:45.078
Oh--
I want the camera
to circle you

10:45.178 --> 10:47.180
like the kiss
in Vertigo.

10:47.280 --> 10:50.350
I think it'll tell
our audience that you've
truly forgiven Mr. Adler.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.686
Here, let me show you.
That's not necessary, Shelly.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.087
I don't mind.
I don't mind.
Oh.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.824
Oh, yeah.
Oh, this is great.

10:56.924 --> 10:59.827
60 Minutes would never
have the balls to do
a shot like this.

10:59.927 --> 11:02.595
Mr. Adler,
after our interview,
I-I would like to hear

11:02.730 --> 11:04.832
what you think
about Daniel Rudolph.

11:04.932 --> 11:08.435
I'm investigating him
for a story that I'm doing
about the drought.

11:08.535 --> 11:11.038
Rudolph?
The overreaching
water lord?

11:11.138 --> 11:13.340
Yes, that man.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.617
Okay.

11:24.752 --> 11:27.755
Okay, the Shia-Sunni
conflict,

11:27.788 --> 11:30.123
which dates back
to the year 632 AD--

11:30.223 --> 11:33.761
Jim.
What?!
Jesus, Harry.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.763
You scared the shit out of me.
How long have you been in here?

11:35.863 --> 11:38.832
I snuck in five minutes ago.
I don't want the major
to see me.

11:38.932 --> 11:40.633
Well, you don't have
to worry about that.

11:40.768 --> 11:42.903
He's at the county jail
interviewing Duncan Adler.

11:43.003 --> 11:44.371
Good.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.311
I've come for advice, Jim.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.413
Sylvia and I are finished.

11:53.513 --> 11:55.783
She's moving to New York
for graduate school.

11:55.849 --> 11:58.685
She doesn't believe
in long-distance
relationships.

11:58.786 --> 12:01.789
Oh, no.
Harry, I'm so sorry.

12:01.889 --> 12:05.893
What I'd like to know
is how have you dealt
with romantic pain?

12:05.993 --> 12:09.096
I-I feel like
a piece of my heart
has been cut away

12:09.196 --> 12:11.331
and I want to claw
at the sky.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.666
Hmm.

12:13.801 --> 12:17.637
Well, I've done a lot
of thinking about this

12:17.805 --> 12:21.208
and there are three
possible solutions.

12:21.308 --> 12:24.077
One, another woman.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.980
No.
It's too soon.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.816
I understand.

12:28.882 --> 12:32.185
Two, Laurel and Hardy
suggest pretending to
forget about the woman.

12:32.285 --> 12:35.388
I just learned that one today.
I like the sound of that one.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.825
Yeah.
Clowns are always wise.

12:37.891 --> 12:41.461
And three, some Native
American traditions

12:41.561 --> 12:44.832
suggest dancing
when you're heartbroken.

12:44.898 --> 12:49.369
I do like to dance
despite the chafing.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.839
This is all
very helpful.

12:51.905 --> 12:55.342
I better go
before the major returns.

12:58.211 --> 13:01.448
Good-bye, Jim.
And thank you.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.151
You're a good friend.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.619
Good-bye, Harry.

13:15.362 --> 13:16.897
The play we'll be
reading today

13:16.997 --> 13:19.266
is Chekhov's classic
The Three Sisters.

13:19.366 --> 13:23.436
And if you could please
read the part of Irina,
that would be great.

13:23.536 --> 13:27.240
Some of the guys don't like
to play women unless they
have to for cigarettes.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.576
Mmm, I wouldn't mind.

13:29.676 --> 13:31.511
It's what they did
in Shakespeare's day.

13:31.611 --> 13:33.413
But I can't have
the word get out.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.883
I understand, dear.

13:35.949 --> 13:39.086
Mr. Adler, why are you
called the Oscar Wildes?

13:39.186 --> 13:40.720
Because we're
the unfairly imprisoned.

13:40.888 --> 13:42.890
Also we're a theater group.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.359
Okay, list of characters.

13:51.965 --> 13:54.634
Well, I think
all this robot stuff
works really well, Martin.

13:54.902 --> 13:55.668
Good job.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.037
Thanks, Jim.

13:59.172 --> 14:02.742
Uh, so you've been
very sad about Celia,
haven't you?

14:02.910 --> 14:04.811
Yep. You know what?
Real sad.

14:04.912 --> 14:06.779
Do you want
to know something
I shouldn't tell you?

14:06.914 --> 14:09.216
Celia thinks
you're sexy again.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.118
She does?
Yeah.

14:11.218 --> 14:13.020
Why?

14:13.120 --> 14:15.222
No idea.

14:15.322 --> 14:17.357
Oh, my God.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.426
I-I think I know why.
Really?

14:19.526 --> 14:22.362
Remember that Medicine
Cabinet piece?
Uh-huh.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.597
Women's noses
can smell anything--

14:24.697 --> 14:27.767
immunities, disease,
fertility.

14:27.935 --> 14:29.836
Fear, money problems.
Right.

14:29.937 --> 14:34.274
So I think what
she's smelling on me
is another woman.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.443
Why is there
another woman on you?

14:36.543 --> 14:38.946
Because I got
drunk last night
at the fundraiser

14:39.046 --> 14:42.249
and this older woman
Evelyn picked me up.

14:42.349 --> 14:43.783
Now, wait, really?
An older woman?

14:43.951 --> 14:45.552
Was she as sexy
as Rosalie?

14:45.652 --> 14:47.154
Um...

14:50.357 --> 14:52.492
Not quite as sexy,

14:52.592 --> 14:54.627
but sh-she was hot.
Oh.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.130
She thought I was
a prostitute, which has
never happened before.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.967
Of course it
hasn't happened before.
You're not a whore.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.969
Yeah, I know.
That's what I said.

15:02.035 --> 15:04.972
Anyway, I'm feeling
really guilty about
the whole thing,

15:05.038 --> 15:06.974
but also kind of good.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.977
So don't say anything
to anyone, okay?

15:10.043 --> 15:13.413
Of course not.
I'm very discreet.

15:13.513 --> 15:15.748
Like, you don't know
where I live, right?

15:15.983 --> 15:17.417
Yeah, I do.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.987
Really? How?
I've never told you.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.555
I followed you one night
a few months ago.

15:22.655 --> 15:25.825
I was in
a really weird mood.
What?

15:25.993 --> 15:28.996
"Where?
Where has it all gone?

15:29.062 --> 15:31.831
Where is it?
Oh, my God, my God.

15:31.999 --> 15:35.535
I have forgotten everything.
Forgotten everything.

15:35.635 --> 15:38.505
Everything
is confused in my head.

15:38.605 --> 15:41.908
I can't remember
what is the word
for window in Italian.

15:42.009 --> 15:45.578
Or for ceiling.
I am forgetting everything.

15:45.678 --> 15:48.081
I forget more every day

15:48.181 --> 15:51.751
and life flies past
and never returns.

15:51.851 --> 15:55.622
Never.
And we will never
go to Moscow."

15:55.722 --> 15:59.326
I can't take this.
Life's too sad.

15:59.426 --> 16:01.628
I want to be free.

16:04.164 --> 16:05.665
Up. Up! Up!

16:05.765 --> 16:08.368
Rosalie!
Tiny, that's my toothbrush!

16:08.468 --> 16:10.503
I'm sorry, Duncan,
but I want out of here

16:10.603 --> 16:12.039
or I'm gonna ventilate
this tomato.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.640
- Are you getting this?
- Walter!

16:13.740 --> 16:15.842
Stop that!
Let her go!

16:17.777 --> 16:20.147
All of you down now.
Hands behind your heads.

16:20.247 --> 16:23.050
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
It was thrilling.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.917
I can't believe this,
Mr. Adler.

16:25.052 --> 16:26.353
This had nothing
to do with me, Walter.

16:26.453 --> 16:27.520
I thought they all
liked theater.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.122
This is great!
Line 'em up.

16:29.222 --> 16:30.890
We're gonna have to nix
the interview, Mr. Blunt.

16:31.058 --> 16:32.059
I gotta put
these inmates
in lockdown.

16:32.159 --> 16:33.560
I understand, Officer.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.895
Listen, before you go
to lockdown, Mr. Adler,

16:36.063 --> 16:37.364
tell me what you know
about Rudolph.

16:37.464 --> 16:40.067
Quid pro quo.
You pull some strings
to get me out of here,

16:40.100 --> 16:41.768
I'll get you something
good on Rudolph.

16:41.868 --> 16:44.604
Mr. Adler, I tell you,
I don't have that kind
of influence.

16:44.704 --> 16:47.274
Mr. Blunt, I--
No, please.
This is important.

16:47.374 --> 16:51.944
LA needs water
and this man Rudolph
controls too much of it.

16:52.079 --> 16:54.247
All right,
forget the quid,
here's my quo.

16:54.347 --> 16:58.318
Look into the death
of a councilman named
Wadsworth in 2001.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.287
He was pro water recycling.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.189
I think he was murdered.

17:02.289 --> 17:03.990
Murdered?
You got that?

17:04.091 --> 17:05.725
- Move along, let's go.
- Wadsworth, got it.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.660
Don't forget
about me, Walter.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.629
And send vegan food.

17:09.729 --> 17:12.165
And kosher.
And low-salt.

17:12.265 --> 17:14.301
I loved your Irina!

17:16.103 --> 17:18.938
What took place today
at the Los Angeles County Jail

17:19.106 --> 17:21.174
was frightening
and disturbing.

17:21.274 --> 17:23.810
But our own executive
producer Rosalie Winter

17:23.910 --> 17:25.978
showed mettle
and great courage.

17:26.113 --> 17:29.949
You were so brave.
Mr. Adler,
a well-intentioned, but...

17:30.117 --> 17:34.554
This Councilman Wadsworth,
his death is suspicious.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.589
Oh, no, not again.

17:38.125 --> 17:40.827
I'm sorry, Martin.
Oh, it's okay.

17:40.927 --> 17:43.730
I'm incapable of monogamy.
Me, too.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.965
Thank God Teddy's
the same way.

17:46.133 --> 17:49.869
...unlawful possession
of a firearm and kidnapping.

17:50.137 --> 17:52.139
Love.

17:52.172 --> 17:57.009
Do you want to come
over later and have dinner
and discuss our breakup?

17:57.144 --> 17:59.812
I do.
That's all we have
for tonight.

17:59.912 --> 18:03.750
I'm Walter Blunt
right here, right now.

18:59.206 --> 19:00.807
Oh, mmm.

19:00.907 --> 19:03.042
It's-- it's--
it's a little--
a little too dark.

19:03.210 --> 19:04.611
Oh, is it? Okay.
Uh...

19:04.711 --> 19:07.314
I'll turn the lights on.
Is that better?

19:07.414 --> 19:09.115
Uh, yeah,
a little--

19:09.216 --> 19:11.284
no, it's-- uh, now it's--
it's too bright.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.353
Too bright? Okay.
It's a little too bright.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.355
Thanks. Oh.
Yeah.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.690
It'll work.
Better?

19:22.462 --> 19:24.331
It's, um--
don't you think--

19:24.431 --> 19:26.499
don't you--
don't you think it's--
don't you think--

19:26.599 --> 19:28.468
What?
Don't-- don't you think
it's a little stuffy in here?

19:28.568 --> 19:29.736
Stuffy in here?
Yeah.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.671
Are you stuffy? Oh.
Yeah.

19:31.771 --> 19:34.040
Ah, okay.
Sorry.

19:34.274 --> 19:35.775
Um...

19:38.245 --> 19:40.012
There, that's fine.

19:40.247 --> 19:41.848
Ooh, sorry.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.353
I'm just gonna use
the bathroom.

19:46.453 --> 19:49.256
Okay.
Oh, God.

19:52.959 --> 19:55.428
Hey.
Oh, shit.

19:56.763 --> 19:59.499
Ah!

20:01.468 --> 20:03.570
That's okay.
Fine.

21:19.479 --> 21:21.614
Sh-- shit.

21:29.956 --> 21:33.225
Thought I'd make myself
more comfortable.

21:33.360 --> 21:37.364
And I meant
to tell you that, uh,
I cut myself shaving.

21:37.430 --> 21:39.265
A deep wound.

21:39.366 --> 21:41.200
Who's Evelyn?

21:41.368 --> 21:43.770
And why did she write
"That was money well spent"

21:43.870 --> 21:46.506
and send you pictures
of her feet?

21:46.606 --> 21:49.876
Uh, this is...

21:49.976 --> 21:52.011
This is, uh...

21:58.017 --> 22:00.387
I was ready
to give you my heart!

22:03.923 --> 22:05.558
What are you doing
there, Herschel?

22:05.658 --> 22:08.528
Just keeping
the logbook updated.
Harry asked me to.

22:08.628 --> 22:10.563
Harry.

22:12.899 --> 22:15.668
What's a 10-letter
word for idiot

22:15.768 --> 22:17.504
beginning with an N?

22:17.604 --> 22:21.040
Nimrod.
No, no, that's
six letters.

22:21.140 --> 22:24.043
Ooh, I'll get it, General.

22:24.143 --> 22:26.613
Oh, yes, of course.
I've got it.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.681
Nincompoop.

22:28.781 --> 22:30.717
Yes, Officers.

22:30.817 --> 22:32.419
What's going on?

22:32.452 --> 22:35.021
Walter, it's--
it's Harry.

22:36.623 --> 22:39.426
Ah, Mr. Blunt,
this gentleman
says he lives here,

22:39.492 --> 22:42.028
but he didn't have
any identification.

22:42.128 --> 22:45.698
Yes, he lives here.

22:45.798 --> 22:47.299
This is his home.

22:47.434 --> 22:49.335
Well, good.
He seemed like
a nice guy.

22:49.436 --> 22:51.270
Didn't want
to have to take him
to the drunk tank.

22:51.438 --> 22:53.473
I appreciate that
very much.

22:53.573 --> 22:56.008
We'll take it
from here, Officers.

22:56.108 --> 22:58.310
Herschel.
Oh, my goodness.

22:58.445 --> 23:01.280
Oh, God, Harry.
Come on, Harry.

23:01.448 --> 23:04.283
Uh, careful, and...
Oh!

23:04.451 --> 23:07.186
All right,
Herschel, will you
see the officers out?

23:07.454 --> 23:09.155
Okay.

23:10.189 --> 23:12.825
What happened, Harry?

23:12.925 --> 23:16.529
Sylvia and I,
it's all over.

23:17.564 --> 23:19.832
She's getting an MFA
in the Big--

23:19.932 --> 23:22.669
Big Apple.

23:22.769 --> 23:25.672
And Jim told me to forget

23:25.772 --> 23:28.140
and to dance.

23:28.240 --> 23:31.811
And I quit working
for Ronnie.

23:32.979 --> 23:35.047
Oh, dear.

23:35.147 --> 23:37.650
I think I need
a bucket, Major.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.351
Yeah, a bucket, Herschel.
Oh, shit, he's gonna puke.

23:39.486 --> 23:41.153
Uh-- uh--
hold on, Harry.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.322
Just hold on.
Herschel, quickly!

23:43.490 --> 23:45.124
Where are the buckets?

23:45.224 --> 23:47.627
Harry, where's the bucket?
Oh, Lord.

23:47.727 --> 23:49.328
Herschel, hurry.

23:49.496 --> 23:51.664
Oh, my God.

23:51.764 --> 23:54.333
Oh, no! Oh.

23:54.567 --> 23:55.502
Get a mop.

23:55.602 --> 23:57.870
Wh-where's the mops?
With the bucket.

23:57.970 --> 24:00.673
I-- you didn't tell me
where the buckets are yet.

24:00.773 --> 24:01.774
Oh, Lord.

24:10.750 --> 24:13.085
He's drifted off.

24:13.185 --> 24:14.954
Herschel,
what's going on?

24:15.054 --> 24:16.523
I called my mother, Walter,

24:16.589 --> 24:18.390
and she said
she'll have me back.

24:18.525 --> 24:20.560
I don't think you need me
anymore now that Harry's home.

24:20.660 --> 24:24.163
She's really
taking you back?
Yeah.

24:24.263 --> 24:26.966
I can't thank you enough
for everything.

24:27.066 --> 24:29.869
I learned a lot
being your servant.

24:29.969 --> 24:31.638
I would hug you,
but remember

24:31.738 --> 24:33.740
what happened
last time with
my brass knuckle.

24:37.176 --> 24:39.646
Herschel, may I tell
you one thing?

24:39.746 --> 24:42.549
Of course.
I don't think
you're a sex addict.

24:42.582 --> 24:45.752
In fact, I don't think there's
anything wrong with you at all.

24:45.852 --> 24:49.188
You are a wonderful man.

24:49.288 --> 24:52.224
Just try not to forget that.

24:54.026 --> 24:55.595
Can I hug you now?

24:59.999 --> 25:01.868
Thank you, Walter.

25:10.342 --> 25:14.080
Major, what are you doing?

25:14.180 --> 25:17.049
I thought I should keep
an eye on you, Harry.

25:17.149 --> 25:19.586
You were in rough shape.

25:19.652 --> 25:21.588
Yeah.

25:21.654 --> 25:24.323
I don't remember
getting into bed.

25:24.591 --> 25:26.759
Here.

25:26.859 --> 25:27.860
Drink that.

25:38.805 --> 25:41.641
You kept my room
just as it was, Major.

25:41.741 --> 25:44.010
You were only gone
a week, Harry.

25:44.110 --> 25:46.078
It felt longer
than that, sir.

25:46.178 --> 25:48.915
Oh, it certainly did.

25:50.717 --> 25:54.220
I'm very sorry
about Sylvia.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.288
I know how much
you care for her.

25:56.388 --> 26:00.259
Will I always
be alone now, Major?

26:00.359 --> 26:03.663
Not as long
as I'm around, Harry.

26:05.297 --> 26:07.266
We're quite the pair,
aren't we, sir?

26:07.366 --> 26:10.737
"We are the zanies
of sorrow.

26:10.837 --> 26:13.806
We are clowns
whose hearts are broken."

26:15.141 --> 26:16.743
Oscar Wilde?
Yes.

26:16.843 --> 26:20.212
Oh.
He's been on
my mind today.

26:22.048 --> 26:24.216
Would you
like me to read you
something, Harry?

26:24.316 --> 26:26.185
Help you
fall back to sleep?

26:26.285 --> 26:27.987
I'd like that
very much, sir.

26:28.087 --> 26:31.958
Well, you have
Tarzan of the Apes,

26:32.058 --> 26:33.760
The Island of Dr. Moreau,

26:33.860 --> 26:35.862
and 20,000 Leagues
Under the Sea.

26:35.962 --> 26:37.664
20,000 Leagues, please.

26:37.730 --> 26:38.998
Very good.

26:42.902 --> 26:46.338
Oh, I'll pick up
where you left off.
Yeah.

26:47.874 --> 26:49.909
"The sea is everything.

26:50.009 --> 26:53.680
It covers seven-tenths
of the terrestrial globe.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.815
Its breath
is pure and healthy.

26:55.915 --> 26:59.385
It is an immense desert
where man is never lonely,

26:59.485 --> 27:03.690
for he feels life
stirring on all sides.

27:03.790 --> 27:06.525
The sea is only
the embodiment

27:06.693 --> 27:09.762
of a supernatural
and wonderful existence.

27:09.862 --> 27:13.365
It is nothing but love
and emotion.

27:13.465 --> 27:16.836
It is the Living
Infinite."
