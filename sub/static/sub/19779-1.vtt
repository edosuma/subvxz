03:12.519 --> 03:13.987
Thanks, Dalwyn.

03:17.758 --> 03:19.225
That was a good fight.

03:22.262 --> 03:24.629
Nice loot! We've got the amulet!

03:24.631 --> 03:27.399
Perfect! Let's move on!

03:27.401 --> 03:29.199
Spawns are dangerous in this zone!

03:29.201 --> 03:30.768
Dalwyn, can you teleport us?

03:30.770 --> 03:32.370
Sure.

03:32.372 --> 03:34.608
Go ahead. I'll catch up with you later.

03:35.574 --> 03:37.441
I need to check my emails.

03:37.443 --> 03:38.712
Okay.

03:59.199 --> 04:00.368
Log out.

04:30.362 --> 04:32.697
<i>The year is 2047.</i>

04:32.699 --> 04:35.867
<i>A century of
technological revolution.</i>

04:35.869 --> 04:41.208
<i>The revolution did happen, just not
really the way people thought it would.</i>

04:43.242 --> 04:44.709
<i>People were expecting robots,</i>

04:44.711 --> 04:48.779
<i>flying cars, more
spatial exploration.</i>

04:48.781 --> 04:51.483
<i>Well, all of that did happen.</i>

04:51.485 --> 04:54.853
<i>But none of it was the revolution.</i>

04:54.855 --> 04:59.824
<i>The revolution wasn't our better
grasp and control on our reality.</i>

04:59.826 --> 05:02.129
<i>It was our escape from it.</i>

05:04.598 --> 05:06.865
<i>It all started as just games,</i>

05:06.867 --> 05:09.334
<i>virtual worlds called verses,</i>

05:09.336 --> 05:12.536
<i>in which players could play
avatars in different kinds of sets.</i>

05:12.538 --> 05:15.807
<i>From medieval to science
fiction to Western.</i>

05:15.809 --> 05:18.343
<i>You name it.</i>

05:18.345 --> 05:21.613
<i>These verses became
more and more realistic.</i>

05:21.615 --> 05:23.481
<i>Until the moment it became difficult</i>

05:23.483 --> 05:28.185
<i>to tell the difference
between reality and fantasy.</i>

05:28.187 --> 05:31.825
<i>When there was no reason to
stay in the real world anymore.</i>

05:34.627 --> 05:36.860
<i>Society has changed.</i>

05:36.862 --> 05:41.199
<i>75% of the population,
known as the Connected,</i>

05:41.201 --> 05:43.935
<i>don't give a damn
about reality anymore,</i>

05:43.937 --> 05:45.937
<i>and now spend all of
their time online,</i>

05:45.939 --> 05:49.777
<i>leaving the real world
to a small minority.</i>

05:51.343 --> 05:53.478
<i>The revolution did happen.</i>

05:53.480 --> 05:56.150
<i>Just not the way people
thought it would.</i>

06:15.668 --> 06:19.272
<i>Olmetta Worlds, where
death never ends.</i>

06:34.687 --> 06:37.190
<i>Discover worlds without limits.</i>

06:37.824 --> 06:39.225
<i>Synternis.</i>

06:47.334 --> 06:48.498
Dina.

06:48.500 --> 06:49.702
Nash.

06:52.706 --> 06:54.272
We have a new case.

06:54.274 --> 06:55.873
It happened a few hours ago.

06:55.875 --> 06:58.442
Players from the West
Land verse were killed.

06:58.444 --> 07:01.579
- More virulently than the last attack.
- How many?

07:01.581 --> 07:02.750
One hundred and forty-eight.

07:03.716 --> 07:04.815
Our players were prepared,

07:04.817 --> 07:06.284
but it wasn't enough.

07:06.286 --> 07:08.752
They managed to perfect the virus.

07:08.754 --> 07:11.257
How are you going to hide 148 dead bodies?

07:11.858 --> 07:13.591
That's our job, Nash.

07:13.593 --> 07:15.760
Yours is to find out who's responsible.

07:15.762 --> 07:19.663
This terrorist threat has got to
be dealt with as soon as possible.

07:19.665 --> 07:21.933
The attacks are getting out of hand.

07:21.935 --> 07:24.735
Maybe it's time to contact Interpol?

07:24.737 --> 07:26.870
I don't think that's a good idea.

07:26.872 --> 07:29.339
Their servers are hacked all the time.

07:29.341 --> 07:33.279
If Interpol got involved, we wouldn't be
able to target the Necromancers directly.

07:34.680 --> 07:38.582
I think your wages show the
recognition we have of your talent.

07:38.584 --> 07:43.288
You, of all people, wouldn't want to
see this problem go to someone else.

07:43.290 --> 07:45.889
Of course not. That's not what I meant.

07:45.891 --> 07:49.961
But the number of casualties
are increasing every single time.

07:49.963 --> 07:53.397
Maybe we're not proceeding
in the best way possible.

07:53.399 --> 07:55.500
The Necromancers are but a few.

07:55.502 --> 07:58.002
They have distinct and independent cells.

07:58.004 --> 07:59.603
With each cell that we destroy

07:59.605 --> 08:01.908
we are a step closer to a resolution.

08:02.675 --> 08:04.308
It takes time.

08:04.310 --> 08:05.878
But we are winning.

08:08.947 --> 08:10.817
Okay. What's the address?

08:12.851 --> 08:15.488
I am uploading the
information onto your PDA.

08:16.523 --> 08:19.022
So far, all we have is a location.

08:19.024 --> 08:22.426
The virus was traced back to an IP address.

08:22.428 --> 08:25.762
Find who the Necromancers
are and eliminate them.

08:25.764 --> 08:27.964
You'll get paid for the
terrorists behind the attack,

08:27.966 --> 08:30.935
as well as any cell
member that you identify.

08:30.937 --> 08:33.703
Once you proceed to
elimination, contact us.

08:33.706 --> 08:35.772
We'll send in the cleaners.

08:35.774 --> 08:37.309
As per usual.

08:38.677 --> 08:39.809
Nash.

08:39.812 --> 08:42.078
This latest crisis is unfortunate,

08:42.081 --> 08:44.815
but we're delighted to have you on board.

08:44.817 --> 08:46.617
We trust you.

08:46.619 --> 08:48.389
I'll try not to disappoint, then.

09:33.066 --> 09:36.800
<i>The good thing with having most of
the population locking itself inside,</i>

09:36.802 --> 09:40.407
<i>is that the risk of getting caught
while breaking and entering someplace</i>

09:40.907 --> 09:42.676
<i>is pretty low.</i>

10:22.182 --> 10:24.749
Typical.

12:40.620 --> 12:42.320
That was fun.

14:13.278 --> 14:15.278
Easy.

14:15.280 --> 14:18.949
Stop being such a softy, dude.

14:18.951 --> 14:20.887
Try not to enjoy torturing me so much.

14:23.423 --> 14:26.924
You do have a peculiar
way of thanking people.

14:26.926 --> 14:28.693
You could have said, "Thank you, Morel,

14:28.695 --> 14:31.027
"for welcoming me in
the middle of the night,"

14:31.029 --> 14:35.065
or, "Thank you, Morel, for patching me
up when I turn up without any notice."

14:35.067 --> 14:37.037
Would you just shut up?

14:37.836 --> 14:39.036
Yeah...

14:39.038 --> 14:40.371
That too.

14:40.373 --> 14:42.906
I presume you could have said that too,

14:42.908 --> 14:44.910
but it's not so nice, though.

14:46.979 --> 14:48.281
Anyway, what happened?

14:51.783 --> 14:52.985
Bad encounter.

14:53.753 --> 14:56.056
Ooh, bad encounter.

14:57.023 --> 14:58.955
Stop pulling my leg.

14:58.957 --> 15:01.124
This kind of thing doesn't happen anymore.

15:01.126 --> 15:03.927
You can't make bad encounters
in the streets nowadays.

15:03.929 --> 15:06.262
There's no one left to meet in the streets.

15:06.264 --> 15:09.233
Well, except in places like here.

15:09.235 --> 15:11.736
Oh, you didn't get
mugged out there, I hope?

15:11.738 --> 15:13.137
No.

15:13.139 --> 15:14.307
Good.

15:17.375 --> 15:18.943
Seriously,

15:18.945 --> 15:20.978
what do you really want?

15:20.980 --> 15:22.278
Look, I know you.

15:22.280 --> 15:24.147
You like me.

15:24.149 --> 15:26.850
No, no. Don't say anything,
I know it. You like me.

15:26.852 --> 15:29.252
I might be the closest
thing to a friend you've got.

15:29.254 --> 15:33.456
But still, you wouldn't go so far
as to stop by just to get some news.

15:33.458 --> 15:35.358
And I'm doing well, by the way.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.194
Thanks for asking.

15:37.196 --> 15:40.363
No, you do need something from me.

15:40.365 --> 15:42.999
And this has got nothing to
do with some stitching up.

15:43.001 --> 15:46.237
I'm quite sure you've got everything
you need at your place for that. So?

15:46.239 --> 15:49.973
There's a police camera, at Rue
des Deux Freres and Rue Montaubard.

15:49.975 --> 15:51.776
Can you access the history records?

15:51.778 --> 15:55.912
You're talking about hacking
Interpol's servers. It's a bit risky.

15:55.914 --> 15:58.047
I'm told they're hacked into
all the time. Can you do it?

15:58.049 --> 16:00.151
Hey, I never said I couldn't do it.

16:00.153 --> 16:02.788
I just said it was risky. That's all.

16:04.157 --> 16:06.793
2,000 euro credits for
you if you can do it.

16:07.225 --> 16:08.294
Money?

16:09.495 --> 16:11.929
I don't want money.

16:11.931 --> 16:13.998
What I want, money can't buy.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.233
Or not that easily.

16:16.235 --> 16:21.774
But I know that you have some clients
with access to certain hardware.

16:23.009 --> 16:25.276
And I do like hardware.

16:25.278 --> 16:29.182
So, if you can get me that,

16:31.817 --> 16:34.084
I'll take care of your camera.

16:34.086 --> 16:36.186
Okay, so, what are you looking for?

16:36.188 --> 16:38.589
Maybe you want to know where
the guy who did that to you went?

16:38.591 --> 16:40.523
Then that would mean hacking the records

16:40.525 --> 16:42.826
of all the other cameras
in the neighborhood.

16:42.828 --> 16:44.295
And that could become heavy.

16:44.297 --> 16:46.597
I would probably get caught
before getting anything.

16:46.599 --> 16:49.233
No. Don't bother following them.

16:49.235 --> 16:53.871
Those guys tend to use sewers and abandoned
subway lines as their mode of operation.

16:53.873 --> 16:56.073
No, his face in good
resolution is all I need.

16:56.075 --> 16:58.409
- Then I can identify him.
- Okay.

16:58.411 --> 17:01.946
Um, how will I know which one is your guy?

17:01.948 --> 17:05.181
He's a big, bald, ugly son of
a bitch. You can't miss him.

17:05.183 --> 17:09.319
Are you even sure that he went
in front of the camera, at least?

17:09.320 --> 17:12.122
No. I don't even know which way
he went when he left the building.

17:12.124 --> 17:15.092
Damn camera is positioned down the street.

17:15.094 --> 17:16.962
Doesn't overlook the building's entrance.

17:17.462 --> 17:19.063
Okay.

17:19.065 --> 17:21.101
So, what do I do if I can't find him?

17:23.935 --> 17:26.002
Do a face recognition analysis.

17:26.005 --> 17:28.538
Identify anyone who's been
appearing near the building

17:28.540 --> 17:32.075
more than once in the last
seven days, not before.

17:32.077 --> 17:34.079
Uh... Pfft. Okay.

17:37.048 --> 17:39.952
Seriously, who still hires a
private in this day and age?

17:41.354 --> 17:43.219
People who can afford it.

17:43.221 --> 17:46.257
And that's cool with me,
because I like getting paid.

17:46.259 --> 17:49.426
Yeah. And I don't picture
you becoming Connected.

17:49.428 --> 17:51.398
If only because of what happened to Helena.

17:53.365 --> 17:55.164
Seriously?

17:55.166 --> 17:56.967
What the fuck is wrong with you?

17:56.969 --> 17:59.569
Every single time I come over
here, you mention her name!

17:59.571 --> 18:01.037
Sorry, sorry, okay?

18:01.039 --> 18:02.972
It just slipped out of my mouth.

18:02.974 --> 18:04.507
What? You know me. I say shit.

18:04.509 --> 18:07.510
You, you come around asking for
weird stuff, and me, I say shit.

18:07.512 --> 18:09.246
This is just who we are, right?

18:09.248 --> 18:10.884
Hey! We good?

18:17.323 --> 18:19.456
<i>No matter how many times I tell him,</i>

18:19.458 --> 18:22.992
<i>he always talks about Helena.</i>

18:22.994 --> 18:27.064
<i>That being said, the guy
is not a complete idiot.</i>

18:27.066 --> 18:29.870
<i>He could feel something's
off with his sister's death.</i>

18:31.136 --> 18:34.071
<i>But he could never figure it out.</i>

18:34.073 --> 18:36.877
<i>I guess that's what's
still troubling him.</i>

18:44.349 --> 18:48.017
<i>I had connected the doorbell
to my gaming station.</i>

18:48.019 --> 18:50.289
<i>Almost no one was doing it anymore.</i>

18:53.692 --> 18:55.526
Who is it?

18:55.528 --> 18:57.428
The one who works when you
spend some good time online.

18:57.430 --> 18:58.597
Open up!

19:01.299 --> 19:02.301
Anyone follow you?

19:03.269 --> 19:05.602
There's no one outside!

19:05.604 --> 19:07.671
Like yesterday and like the day before.

19:07.673 --> 19:09.009
Jesus, get real!

19:10.308 --> 19:12.209
Well, maybe try calling next time!

19:12.211 --> 19:14.678
And talk about some illegal
business over the phone?

19:14.680 --> 19:16.580
What's wrong with you?

19:16.582 --> 19:18.548
You've been spending too much
time in your fairy worlds.

19:18.550 --> 19:20.953
In reality, things work differently.

19:22.320 --> 19:23.988
So, what did you find?

19:23.990 --> 19:26.623
About the guy who had fun
with your face, nothing.

19:26.625 --> 19:30.059
I checked all six hours before the
assault and the two hours after,

19:30.061 --> 19:33.299
and no one that looked like your
guy walked in front of that camera.

19:33.766 --> 19:35.701
However...

19:37.603 --> 19:39.202
Go on.

19:39.204 --> 19:42.305
However, I found a guy
who appeared several times

19:42.307 --> 19:44.641
during the last three
days before your arrival,

19:44.643 --> 19:47.143
never before, never after.

19:47.145 --> 19:49.113
Definitely not a fighter, though.

19:49.115 --> 19:51.114
Good. What about the resolution scan?

19:51.116 --> 19:52.615
Got it. Don't worry.

19:52.617 --> 19:54.351
But is it good? Does it work?

19:54.353 --> 19:56.286
Chill out!

19:56.288 --> 19:59.355
I put that on a flash drive to
avoid sending it over the Net.

19:59.357 --> 20:00.993
It's all here.

20:03.561 --> 20:06.063
Did you receive your
hardware list that you wanted?

20:06.065 --> 20:08.632
No, not yet.

20:08.634 --> 20:11.101
But it's okay. I trust you.

20:11.103 --> 20:12.469
You're the honest kind.

20:12.471 --> 20:13.804
Not always the nice kind,

20:13.806 --> 20:15.506
but definitely the honest kind.

20:15.508 --> 20:17.574
Don't worry. I transmitted all the info.

20:17.576 --> 20:19.312
- You'll get it soon.
- Okay.

20:39.832 --> 20:41.297
Any good news?

20:41.299 --> 20:43.167
Oh...

20:43.169 --> 20:45.469
I see you've encountered...

20:45.471 --> 20:47.073
...some complications.

20:48.240 --> 20:50.373
Let's just say they know I'm after them.

20:50.375 --> 20:51.711
Indeed they do.

20:53.711 --> 20:55.248
What have you got?

20:56.682 --> 20:59.749
I have the man's face on the video.

20:59.751 --> 21:02.688
I need you to put it through your
database so I can identify him.

21:03.588 --> 21:05.057
We'll take care of that.

21:17.303 --> 21:19.773
Find out who the person on the
video is and get me the results.

21:22.875 --> 21:24.711
That shouldn't take very long.

21:31.317 --> 21:33.350
So, has Interpol been in touch yet?

21:33.352 --> 21:35.451
So far, we've been able
to forge the deaths.

21:35.453 --> 21:38.154
Gamers who die Connected,
it happens every day.

21:38.156 --> 21:42.392
Just a little makeup to hide the
burns caused by the brain discharge.

21:42.394 --> 21:43.861
Sounds appetizing.

21:43.863 --> 21:45.832
Your food tastes are your own concern.

21:50.736 --> 21:52.536
Here we are.

21:52.538 --> 21:54.304
Leonard Lorenz.

21:54.306 --> 21:57.076
144, Rue Michel Colucci.

21:57.643 --> 21:59.245
Apartment 406.

22:00.412 --> 22:01.780
I'm off then.

22:04.316 --> 22:05.785
Oh, uh...

22:07.219 --> 22:08.421
By the way,

22:09.855 --> 22:11.688
I'm going to need a new gun.

22:11.690 --> 22:14.357
It will be deducted from your bounties.

22:14.359 --> 22:15.394
Stop by the warehouse.

26:00.618 --> 26:02.788
<i>Well, I have a job to do.</i>

26:06.858 --> 26:08.057
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

26:08.059 --> 26:11.128
<i>Not a very nice job.</i>

26:11.130 --> 26:14.096
<i>Not very brave for me to kill
someone who can't defend themselves</i>

26:14.098 --> 26:17.767
<i>or even know what's
happening to them.</i>

26:17.769 --> 26:23.038
<i>Then again, we're talking about a guy
who just killed 148 innocent gamers.</i>

26:23.040 --> 26:24.876
<i>Not really a saint.</i>

26:27.211 --> 26:29.578
<i>On the other hand, killing a
Necromancer while he's connected</i>

26:29.580 --> 26:32.082
<i>is actually very useful to me.</i>

26:32.084 --> 26:33.749
<i>Leonard didn't have time to log out,</i>

26:33.751 --> 26:36.886
<i>so, if I'm fast enough
to take his place,</i>

26:36.888 --> 26:40.123
<i>the machine will accept
me as the Necromancer,</i>

26:40.125 --> 26:43.893
<i>which allows me to use his avatar.</i>

26:43.895 --> 26:45.964
<i>Nothing better for
an undercover job.</i>

27:31.742 --> 27:33.745
Typical.

28:24.596 --> 28:25.964
Already finished?

28:26.932 --> 28:28.733
I've known you hornier.

28:31.702 --> 28:33.937
I can't focus.

28:33.939 --> 28:36.175
You're worried, I can tell.

28:37.742 --> 28:39.875
Well, Camylle just sent a message.

28:39.877 --> 28:42.144
A meeting has been planned to discuss it.

28:42.146 --> 28:43.883
We need to go to the Surface.

29:15.247 --> 29:16.746
Two factions...

29:16.748 --> 29:18.681
...and one Cerberus.

29:18.683 --> 29:21.617
For now, the Cerberus is the main threat.

29:21.619 --> 29:23.018
As soon as it gets destroyed,

29:23.020 --> 29:24.353
they will start fighting each other.

29:24.355 --> 29:26.823
Good thing.

29:26.825 --> 29:28.792
That means they won't pay attention to us.

29:28.794 --> 29:30.693
Indeed.

29:42.106 --> 29:43.776
Which way do you wanna take?

29:45.810 --> 29:47.245
Further down the road.

29:49.280 --> 29:51.981
I don't hear any sniper shots.

29:51.983 --> 29:54.853
If we are discreet enough, we should be
able to move on without being targeted.

29:56.355 --> 29:58.220
Let's try.

30:24.982 --> 30:26.719
They just stopped working.

30:28.053 --> 30:29.385
They must have a scrambler.

30:29.387 --> 30:31.854
We should expect an ambush.

30:31.856 --> 30:35.124
Do we have even time for that kind of shit?

30:35.126 --> 30:37.730
We don't have the choice, do we?

30:40.731 --> 30:41.866
Let's go.

31:04.221 --> 31:05.354
Cover me!

31:05.356 --> 31:06.858
Copy that!

32:30.942 --> 32:32.241
How many of them are there?

32:32.243 --> 32:33.812
How should I know that?

32:48.160 --> 32:49.959
Why are we even bothering?

32:49.961 --> 32:52.128
Remember. The deeper we are in a PVP zone,

32:52.130 --> 32:54.330
the harder it is for a player to survive,

32:54.332 --> 32:56.099
so the safer it is for us.

32:56.101 --> 32:58.003
No risk to run into an agent randomly.

33:08.380 --> 33:10.082
I'm gonna use a flash grenade.

33:37.509 --> 33:39.107
Nice job.

33:39.109 --> 33:41.312
Let's get the ammunition,
and let's move on.

34:37.101 --> 34:39.103
Thank you for joining us.

34:40.371 --> 34:41.373
Bring the beacon.

34:48.679 --> 34:51.149
So, any news?

34:52.550 --> 34:54.684
Yes.

34:54.686 --> 34:58.220
We got new visitors at the flat
we used for the last attack.

34:58.222 --> 34:59.121
Who?

34:59.123 --> 35:00.623
Another guy working solo?

35:00.625 --> 35:01.657
No.

35:01.659 --> 35:03.492
Interpol.

35:03.494 --> 35:05.864
This time, we prefer
to stay under the radar.

35:06.998 --> 35:09.264
This is the problem with our attacks.

35:09.266 --> 35:11.133
The more efficient they become,

35:11.135 --> 35:12.971
the more attraction we get
from the dangerous people.

35:13.471 --> 35:14.606
Yeah, probably.

35:16.541 --> 35:19.141
This being said,

35:19.143 --> 35:22.644
we're going to have to
change our strategy radically.

35:22.646 --> 35:25.414
The one that we are
using is just not working.

35:25.416 --> 35:28.016
Our plan was to scare the gamers off,

35:28.018 --> 35:29.686
to force them to leave the verses.

35:29.688 --> 35:31.688
But we can't control the media,

35:31.690 --> 35:33.222
so we have no way to let the people know

35:33.224 --> 35:35.624
that there are more and
more cybertronic deaths.

35:35.626 --> 35:38.161
To most of them, they're
just urban legends,

35:38.163 --> 35:43.266
and the gamers who vanished are just playing
new avatars, or left for other verses.

35:43.268 --> 35:46.735
It's useless to kill people
under such conditions.

35:46.737 --> 35:49.107
So what's the new angle, then?

35:52.177 --> 35:53.379
Less violent,

35:54.478 --> 35:56.214
but much more radical.

36:16.067 --> 36:18.070
What? What's the matter?

36:20.405 --> 36:23.008
I'm guessing Leonard is dead, right?

36:24.608 --> 36:27.078
You didn't make the rallying
sign when you came in.

36:28.313 --> 36:31.414
So, chances are you're not Leonard.

36:31.416 --> 36:36.418
But let us give you a
chance to prove us wrong.

36:36.420 --> 36:40.224
What is the password for the bunker, A4?

36:43.394 --> 36:45.097
That's what I thought.

36:46.530 --> 36:47.967
Okay.

36:52.269 --> 36:53.639
Who are you?

36:59.143 --> 37:01.012
One thing I know.

37:06.184 --> 37:08.653
You think you have nothing to worry about.

37:10.554 --> 37:12.757
It's a strong belief online.

37:14.391 --> 37:16.258
But you're wrong.

37:16.260 --> 37:18.429
You will talk, believe me.

37:32.443 --> 37:34.677
This must amuse you, I'm sure.

37:34.679 --> 37:37.447
All the negative sensations, such as pain,

37:37.449 --> 37:40.719
are voluntarily decreased to
a minimum when we are online.

37:41.719 --> 37:44.554
So, the question is,

37:44.556 --> 37:47.393
how do you expect to torture
someone properly, then?

37:48.492 --> 37:49.695
Well...

37:51.695 --> 37:54.032
You do it offline.

37:57.802 --> 37:59.836
In order for you to play Leonard's avatar,

37:59.838 --> 38:01.673
you had to do it from his place, right?

38:02.806 --> 38:05.141
That is very astute of you.

38:05.143 --> 38:09.211
But it also means that
your body is still there.

38:09.213 --> 38:11.382
And we are merely going to recover it.

38:11.715 --> 38:13.051
Go.

38:19.423 --> 38:20.425
Log out!

38:23.527 --> 38:25.327
What's happening?

38:25.329 --> 38:26.632
You can't log out.

38:28.132 --> 38:29.831
This small device I
asked to be brought here

38:29.833 --> 38:32.235
prevents anyone around from disconnecting.

38:32.237 --> 38:35.537
This is why Jon and Leslie had
to leave the room to log off.

38:35.539 --> 38:39.508
Now, offline, they just
have to go to Leonard's flat,

38:39.510 --> 38:41.179
where they will find your body.

38:48.887 --> 38:51.153
What are you going to do to me?

38:51.155 --> 38:52.657
Probably what you did to Leonard.

38:55.893 --> 39:00.262
<i>Our society was building
producers and consumers.</i>

39:00.264 --> 39:02.264
<i>Those who were successful
enough in their studies</i>

39:02.266 --> 39:05.800
were formatted to become
efficient producers.

39:05.802 --> 39:09.539
The others, however, the consumers,

39:09.541 --> 39:12.644
always had a tendency not
to be formatted enough.

39:13.644 --> 39:15.677
Always giving their opinion.

39:15.679 --> 39:18.783
Always challenging the privileges
of our political elites.

39:20.952 --> 39:23.655
Always criticizing inequalities.

39:29.226 --> 39:31.429
Critical sense became
a pain for the rulers.

39:32.931 --> 39:35.400
<i>The virtual worlds solved that.</i>

39:35.766 --> 39:37.365
<i>Right?</i>

39:37.367 --> 39:40.202
<i>What's more docile than a gamer?</i>

39:40.204 --> 39:45.307
<i>For those virtual junkies, real
life is of no interest anymore.</i>

39:45.309 --> 39:49.311
Why do you think Interpol
is now on the case?

39:49.313 --> 39:53.249
<i>The politicians have just as much
interest in maintaining the status quo</i>

39:53.251 --> 39:54.820
<i>as the corporations.</i>

39:56.588 --> 40:00.091
<i>All they want is to keep the
gamers in their vegetative state.</i>

40:03.961 --> 40:05.327
<i>But what you do...</i>

40:07.532 --> 40:10.967
<i>...is to fulfill the
will of the rulers.</i>

40:10.969 --> 40:13.871
You are helping them uphold
their control over us.

40:15.472 --> 40:19.242
From a moral perspective, this is a crime.

40:19.244 --> 40:20.846
And for that, you deserve to die.

41:14.831 --> 41:15.898
Who is it?

41:15.900 --> 41:18.501
Open up, asshole.

41:18.503 --> 41:21.037
Always a nice word. People must love you.

41:21.039 --> 41:22.737
What's the matter?

41:22.739 --> 41:25.376
Is it possible to prevent
a gamer from logging out?

41:26.510 --> 41:27.842
What?

41:27.844 --> 41:30.713
As far as I know, it can't be done. Why?

41:30.715 --> 41:32.581
Never mind.

41:32.583 --> 41:35.650
I need you to search the database
from the verse, Olmetta Worlds.

41:35.652 --> 41:39.789
Map 16, coordinates +144/-5.102.

41:39.791 --> 41:42.961
And find out who's been logging
in or out the last few hours.

41:45.730 --> 41:47.762
Okay, but it's going to take some time.

41:47.764 --> 41:50.465
Do you want me to come to your
place when I have the results?

41:50.467 --> 41:52.767
No, I can wait here. Just
tell me if anything's...

41:55.672 --> 41:57.472
Oh, shit.

41:57.474 --> 41:59.344
A car has landed on the
roof. We have visitors!

42:16.094 --> 42:18.362
Mr. Morel, I reckon?

42:19.597 --> 42:20.732
Yes.

42:21.565 --> 42:22.865
What can I do for you?

42:22.867 --> 42:24.336
Oh...

42:26.737 --> 42:28.072
We need to talk.

42:45.123 --> 42:47.525
Oh, let me introduce myself.

42:48.760 --> 42:51.092
Special Agent Stilson.

42:51.094 --> 42:52.463
Interpol.

42:59.570 --> 43:01.403
You do look good.

43:01.405 --> 43:03.708
Uh... thanks?

43:06.744 --> 43:09.077
What I mean by that, mister,

43:09.079 --> 43:13.749
is that you're not obese, nor dead skinny.

43:13.751 --> 43:17.485
This neighborhood is inhabited by
Connected, Hybrids and Living, all the same,

43:17.487 --> 43:21.092
so it was hard to imagine
what you would look like.

43:22.126 --> 43:25.063
I take it you're not a Connected?

43:26.496 --> 43:28.030
Uh, well, I...

43:28.032 --> 43:32.034
- I spend some time online.
- Mmm-hmm.

43:32.036 --> 43:36.805
But... But I keep on spending
time here too, sometimes.

43:36.807 --> 43:38.773
So you're a Hybrid.

43:38.775 --> 43:40.075
Good.

43:40.077 --> 43:42.510
You know how to keep a grip on our reality.

43:42.512 --> 43:44.914
I like that in a man.

43:44.916 --> 43:50.055
And, you see, I do believe that we
also have other points in common.

43:50.788 --> 43:52.054
Yes. Maybe.

43:52.056 --> 43:53.525
Yes.

43:54.559 --> 43:57.461
We are looking for the same thing.

44:00.130 --> 44:01.532
For instance,

44:02.934 --> 44:05.534
when you hack our servers

44:05.536 --> 44:07.970
in order to search the
record history of a camera,

44:07.972 --> 44:14.746
which happens to be located just near the
scene of a very recent cybertronic crime,

44:16.981 --> 44:19.985
I think our spheres of
interest are pretty close.

44:21.952 --> 44:24.956
What I'd like to know, Mr. Morel,

44:26.590 --> 44:31.096
is why you were interested
in this specific camera.

44:33.231 --> 44:34.762
Well, I...

44:34.764 --> 44:36.434
I was curious. That's it.

44:50.014 --> 44:53.148
Curiosity, Mr. Morel, is a sin.

44:53.150 --> 44:57.186
I feel a man should
stick to some boundaries.

44:57.188 --> 45:00.459
Otherwise, he must be called to order.

45:01.259 --> 45:02.461
Hmm?

45:03.860 --> 45:06.464
Oh, look, let me simplify
the situation for you.

45:07.864 --> 45:09.467
First possibility,

45:10.635 --> 45:13.668
you work for the terrorists,

45:13.670 --> 45:16.539
but in that case you
would have erased the file.

45:16.541 --> 45:19.575
So, second possibility,

45:19.577 --> 45:24.813
you work for someone also very
interested in finding these terrorists.

45:24.815 --> 45:27.052
I strongly suspect,

45:28.585 --> 45:30.721
the corporations attacked by them.

45:31.856 --> 45:35.760
Which is why I am going to ask you nicely.

45:38.262 --> 45:39.530
Who recruited you,

45:40.130 --> 45:41.766
Mr. Morel?

45:49.072 --> 45:50.241
Wait. Wait.

45:52.143 --> 45:54.275
No one recruited me.

45:54.277 --> 45:55.043
All right?

45:55.045 --> 45:57.313
I just came across an internal memo

45:57.315 --> 46:00.048
at Vesglas Corporations about the attack.

46:00.050 --> 46:03.084
And I thought that if I could
discover some valuable information,

46:03.086 --> 46:04.954
maybe there was a way for me

46:04.956 --> 46:06.854
to negotiate a good amount of credits,

46:06.856 --> 46:08.793
by selling it to Vesglas.

46:10.894 --> 46:15.264
Vesglas wasn't one of
the attacked companies.

46:15.266 --> 46:17.936
Yet they still had the info, though.

46:21.271 --> 46:26.307
So, you are not working for
any multinational corporation?

46:26.309 --> 46:30.548
No. Well, not like this, at least.

46:31.315 --> 46:32.380
How so?

46:35.286 --> 46:40.054
I test security systems by
finding out failures in them.

46:40.056 --> 46:43.758
Several companies contact
me so I can test theirs.

46:43.760 --> 46:45.260
If I succeed in getting in,

46:45.262 --> 46:46.996
then I get a nice amount of credits,

46:46.998 --> 46:48.630
in exchange for a report explaining

46:48.632 --> 46:51.700
what the failures are and
how to correct the system.

46:51.702 --> 46:53.101
This is why I live here,

46:53.103 --> 46:54.702
in a connected area.

46:54.704 --> 46:56.704
Breaking in is harder from outside,

46:56.706 --> 46:58.072
since I can't connect directly

46:58.074 --> 47:00.344
to a network inside Neo District.

47:01.646 --> 47:05.246
Well, I guess

47:05.248 --> 47:08.953
our agency could use your
services, one of these days.

47:11.922 --> 47:12.987
With pleasure.

47:12.989 --> 47:14.123
We just need to...

47:14.125 --> 47:17.963
You will do it pro bono, won't you?

47:18.896 --> 47:20.229
And, on our side,

47:20.231 --> 47:22.998
we won't pay too much attention

47:23.000 --> 47:25.400
to the legality or the origin

47:25.402 --> 47:29.104
of your hardware here.

47:29.106 --> 47:31.776
That does seem like an
acceptable deal, doesn't it?

47:33.043 --> 47:34.409
Yes.

47:34.411 --> 47:36.047
So, between us.

47:36.780 --> 47:38.315
Between friends.

47:41.251 --> 47:43.117
What did you find

47:43.119 --> 47:46.287
on the recording history of that camera?

47:46.289 --> 47:47.389
Nothing.

47:47.391 --> 47:49.023
Just a few people walking.

47:49.025 --> 47:51.061
But I found nothing special about them.

47:53.130 --> 47:54.829
I mean, if I had found anything,

47:54.831 --> 47:56.030
anything at all,

47:56.032 --> 47:57.833
I would have already sold it to Vesglas.

47:57.835 --> 47:59.903
But I really couldn't find a thing.

48:01.038 --> 48:02.039
Well...

48:08.913 --> 48:10.878
We will meet again,

48:10.880 --> 48:12.317
Mr. Morel.

48:17.788 --> 48:19.921
What are you doing?

48:19.923 --> 48:21.190
Bathroom.

48:21.192 --> 48:24.126
Get a grip on that
bladder, we've gotta move.

48:24.128 --> 48:27.932
There is somebody else I
really want to pay a visit to.

48:50.954 --> 48:52.157
They're gone!

48:57.427 --> 48:59.196
Thanks for not ratting me out.

49:00.364 --> 49:03.331
Are you sure it's worth it?

49:03.333 --> 49:05.032
You're taking the risk of ending up between

49:05.034 --> 49:07.503
Interpol, the corporations
and the terrorists.

49:07.505 --> 49:10.208
Is it the first time you hear
about this kind of attack?

49:11.041 --> 49:13.208
Yes. Why?

49:13.210 --> 49:15.443
There have been others before?

49:15.445 --> 49:18.380
Apparently, the terrorists are planning
on changing their operating mode.

49:18.382 --> 49:20.449
But I have no idea how.

49:20.451 --> 49:22.818
I should have made that
son of a bitch talk more.

49:22.820 --> 49:23.985
Made who talk?

49:23.987 --> 49:25.387
Thanks for having my back.

49:25.389 --> 49:26.391
I owe you.

49:28.893 --> 49:30.358
Can I still count on you

49:30.360 --> 49:32.297
for the map analysis, in Olmetta Worlds?

49:33.197 --> 49:34.262
Yeah.

49:34.264 --> 49:35.833
Okay, I'm on it.

50:08.431 --> 50:11.133
<i>As I was listening to Camylle,</i>

50:11.135 --> 50:13.905
<i>it was obvious he had
no idea who I was.</i>

50:15.105 --> 50:16.170
<i>So, in all likelihood,</i>

50:16.172 --> 50:18.005
<i>the bastard who beat me up</i>

50:18.007 --> 50:19.977
<i>never transmitted my coordinates.</i>

50:21.110 --> 50:23.147
<i>And I recovered my ID.</i>

50:24.181 --> 50:26.317
<i>My flat was probably still safe.</i>

50:27.451 --> 50:29.086
<i>Well, in theory, that is.</i>

52:10.286 --> 52:11.622
Are you all right?

52:12.523 --> 52:13.658
You seem worried.

52:14.557 --> 52:15.994
I'm fine.

52:32.041 --> 52:34.045
Don't worry. I'm good.

52:49.693 --> 52:51.396
You wanted to see me?

52:52.329 --> 52:53.595
Interpol came here.

52:53.597 --> 52:55.396
They know.

52:55.398 --> 52:56.667
It was only a matter of time.

53:02.206 --> 53:04.608
You didn't tell me the other
companies were concerned.

53:05.208 --> 53:07.476
I didn't know.

53:07.478 --> 53:10.014
You've obviously
discovered things yourself.

53:10.514 --> 53:12.347
What have you got?

53:12.349 --> 53:13.749
The attack was launched against

53:13.751 --> 53:15.383
the three biggest verse companies.

53:15.385 --> 53:17.418
Two officially.

53:17.420 --> 53:20.088
The other ones, we both
know the truth about that.

53:20.090 --> 53:21.389
Yes. I received your message.

53:21.391 --> 53:23.224
"Four down. End of the line."

53:23.226 --> 53:24.559
We sent in the cleaners,

53:24.561 --> 53:26.197
but Interpol was already there.

53:27.431 --> 53:28.630
On the one hand,

53:28.632 --> 53:30.231
I congratulate you,

53:30.233 --> 53:32.501
for eliminating four of them.

53:32.503 --> 53:33.635
On the other hand,

53:33.637 --> 53:35.436
I find it quite frustrating

53:35.438 --> 53:38.240
that the trail has seemed to go cold.

53:38.242 --> 53:40.678
Have you absolutely no new ideas?

53:41.512 --> 53:43.644
No.

53:43.646 --> 53:46.680
I had someone looking at the connections
and disconnections of the zone

53:46.682 --> 53:48.418
where the Necromancers were hiding.

53:49.420 --> 53:50.651
But nothing.

53:50.653 --> 53:53.257
Not even one over the last few weeks.

53:53.791 --> 53:55.389
I guess they

53:55.391 --> 53:58.092
always have some of them connected,

53:58.094 --> 54:00.262
to protect the area from other players.

54:00.264 --> 54:04.035
And they just log in or
log out from elsewhere.

54:04.668 --> 54:05.800
It's very clever

54:05.802 --> 54:08.670
and there's no way to track them.

54:08.672 --> 54:11.505
We need to resolve this
as quickly as possible.

54:11.507 --> 54:12.840
I don't like Interpol

54:12.842 --> 54:14.277
hanging around our business.

54:14.744 --> 54:16.144
We are allies,

54:16.146 --> 54:17.414
but we are not friends.

54:17.815 --> 54:19.815
How's that?

54:19.817 --> 54:22.316
We pay the authorities the taxes they need.

54:22.318 --> 54:25.820
They pay the Connected
the universal income.

54:25.822 --> 54:28.824
And the Connected pay us to use our verses.

54:28.826 --> 54:30.825
It's all a matter of balance.

54:30.827 --> 54:32.760
But isn't it expensive
for the governments to pay

54:32.762 --> 54:35.162
everyone's universal incomes?

54:35.164 --> 54:37.699
No. The amounts are relatively low.

54:37.701 --> 54:39.568
They pay them rent,

54:39.570 --> 54:42.570
a little food, and for the connection.

54:42.572 --> 54:44.371
If you remember in the old days,

54:44.373 --> 54:45.740
they used to have to pay for health care,

54:45.742 --> 54:48.776
retirement fund and unemployment insurance.

54:48.778 --> 54:51.112
Now, they have to pay much less

54:51.114 --> 54:52.680
and for not as long.

54:52.682 --> 54:56.717
The Connected barely reach
a life expectancy of past 40.

54:56.719 --> 54:58.787
They're obese, underfed,

54:58.789 --> 55:01.590
no health care, poor hygiene.

55:01.592 --> 55:03.191
What do you expect?

55:03.193 --> 55:04.592
Don't fool yourself.

55:04.594 --> 55:07.162
If the politicians want to
keep things the way they are,

55:07.164 --> 55:09.764
it's because they benefit from it.

55:09.766 --> 55:11.733
Anyway, the guys from Interpol

55:11.735 --> 55:13.434
pretend they know more than we do

55:13.436 --> 55:16.771
about the Necromancers
behind the latest attack.

55:16.773 --> 55:20.407
I prefer not to send in our
own hackers against them.

55:20.409 --> 55:22.476
You have your own private connections.

55:22.478 --> 55:25.082
Go in there and find out
what you can before them.

55:25.615 --> 55:27.085
And keep me posted.

55:29.186 --> 55:30.188
Will do.

55:32.456 --> 55:34.688
Is it me or you've been
spending all of your time

55:34.690 --> 55:36.691
at my place lately?

55:36.693 --> 55:38.863
Maybe you should start paying rent.

55:40.530 --> 55:41.630
I've been thinking.

55:41.632 --> 55:43.430
The guy from Interpol,

55:43.432 --> 55:46.400
he told you he wanted you to
test out his servers' security,

55:46.402 --> 55:47.668
am I right?

55:47.670 --> 55:49.172
Uh... Yes.

55:50.373 --> 55:52.242
So, what if you access the servers now?

55:53.610 --> 55:54.809
You could always just pretend

55:54.811 --> 55:57.211
that you were curious and that you

55:57.213 --> 55:58.646
just wanted to see for yourself

55:58.648 --> 56:01.349
just how reliable his protocols are.

56:01.351 --> 56:02.483
Come on.

56:02.485 --> 56:05.920
How many times do you want
me to get nuked for you?

56:05.922 --> 56:07.389
It's a walk in a park for you,

56:07.391 --> 56:08.923
compared to last time.

56:08.925 --> 56:11.828
You're not downloading hours
and hours of video files.

56:13.329 --> 56:14.795
I just wanna know

56:14.797 --> 56:17.267
what they have on cybertronic attacks.

56:18.735 --> 56:20.637
Oh, just that?

56:23.773 --> 56:25.673
Okay. Okay.

56:25.675 --> 56:26.911
I'll do it.

56:29.378 --> 56:30.545
Mmm, this is pretty good.

56:30.547 --> 56:32.215
Yeah, yeah, enjoy.

56:59.842 --> 57:03.246
You are surprisingly easy to find, Nash.

57:04.981 --> 57:06.347
Do we know each other?

57:06.349 --> 57:07.351
Yes, we've met.

57:08.351 --> 57:09.985
I am Camylle.

57:09.987 --> 57:14.722
Camylle, you look less manly

57:14.724 --> 57:16.458
than the last time we met.

57:16.460 --> 57:19.461
You're obviously a very perceptive person.

57:19.463 --> 57:22.867
But I'm not here to
discuss my taste in avatars.

57:28.338 --> 57:31.438
Is it the first time we meet?

57:31.440 --> 57:32.742
I mean, offline.

57:34.277 --> 57:36.378
Your face looks familiar to me.

57:36.380 --> 57:40.715
We're meeting for the first time, yes.

57:40.717 --> 57:43.050
How'd you find me?

57:43.052 --> 57:46.787
You left a pile of corpses behind you.

57:46.789 --> 57:50.360
One of our men got to
Leonard's flat before Interpol.

57:51.728 --> 57:54.429
He also recovered our men's PDAs.

57:54.431 --> 57:57.432
On one of them, there
was a scan of your ID,

57:57.434 --> 57:59.237
with a short note about you.

58:00.936 --> 58:03.470
Not very wise leaving that one behind.

58:03.472 --> 58:04.741
No shit...

58:05.574 --> 58:07.744
Synternis Corporations.

58:08.878 --> 58:12.012
We know you're working for them.

58:12.014 --> 58:14.851
But the thing is, you shouldn't.

58:16.887 --> 58:18.256
No?

58:20.090 --> 58:23.461
Considering who you lost, no.

58:24.795 --> 58:26.094
You shouldn't.

58:26.096 --> 58:27.862
What are you talking about?

58:27.864 --> 58:30.097
You're the ones who killed her.

58:30.099 --> 58:31.833
Is that what they told you?

58:31.835 --> 58:33.601
You know, you really
shouldn't be so trusting.

58:33.603 --> 58:35.070
It's your virus that killed her.

58:35.072 --> 58:36.637
You created cybertronic murderers

58:36.639 --> 58:39.074
and Helena was one of your first victims.

58:39.076 --> 58:41.508
We use this virus, yes.

58:41.510 --> 58:43.644
But we didn't create it.

58:43.646 --> 58:46.680
We modified it. And
before that, we stole it

58:46.682 --> 58:48.385
from Synternis.

58:51.521 --> 58:53.688
When we began our movement,

58:53.690 --> 58:56.458
Synternis immediately
identified us as a threat.

58:56.460 --> 59:00.731
They decided to use some pretty
extreme measures against us.

59:01.630 --> 59:03.097
They developed a program

59:03.099 --> 59:06.601
capable of killing a
player while he's online.

59:06.603 --> 59:09.403
They were scanning every
conversation in the verses,

59:09.405 --> 59:14.441
and each time they would find
some of our men, they'd kill them.

59:14.443 --> 59:18.646
That's when we started
developing new cloaking tactics.

59:18.648 --> 59:20.447
We used small programs

59:20.449 --> 59:21.950
to falsify our communications,

59:21.952 --> 59:23.385
we developed white zones,

59:23.387 --> 59:25.823
like the one where you met me online.

59:27.858 --> 59:29.590
And then,

59:29.592 --> 59:30.960
after a while,

59:31.862 --> 59:33.094
we finally figured out

59:33.096 --> 59:35.833
how their killing program was working.

59:36.932 --> 59:39.700
We built our own.

59:39.702 --> 59:43.670
Only we improved it to be able
to kill more people at a time.

59:43.672 --> 59:45.807
What true heroes you are.

59:45.809 --> 59:48.575
I told you online.

59:48.577 --> 59:51.012
We're changing our strategy.

59:51.014 --> 59:53.113
We're gonna put an end to the killings.

59:53.115 --> 59:55.617
What I am telling you now

59:55.619 --> 59:57.988
is that we didn't kill Helena.

59:58.855 --> 01:00:00.358
Synternis did.

01:00:02.025 --> 01:00:03.027
Why?

01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:06.797
Why would Synternis have wanted her dead?

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.869
She was close to our movement.

01:00:14.204 --> 01:00:16.438
She was hoping for more

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:17.373
peaceful solutions

01:00:17.375 --> 01:00:20.474
than the ones that we were contemplating.

01:00:20.476 --> 01:00:21.943
So, yes,

01:00:21.945 --> 01:00:24.448
we did have our differences sometimes.

01:00:25.748 --> 01:00:27.916
But she was one of us.

01:00:27.918 --> 01:00:29.987
Which made her a target for Synternis.

01:00:42.599 --> 01:00:43.968
Bastards!

01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:53.878
You can get your revenge, Nash.

01:00:56.213 --> 01:00:57.415
Help us.

01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:59.213
We're cornered.

01:00:59.215 --> 01:01:01.951
By the corporations, by Interpol.

01:01:03.887 --> 01:01:05.523
But we have a plan.

01:01:07.123 --> 01:01:09.824
Everything is going to end,

01:01:09.826 --> 01:01:10.994
with your help.

01:01:12.996 --> 01:01:15.762
I guess part of me always knew

01:01:15.764 --> 01:01:17.701
something was wrong with Helena's death.

01:01:20.836 --> 01:01:22.537
Now, you don't know

01:01:22.539 --> 01:01:25.876
how right you are when you say
they're getting closer to you.

01:01:27.110 --> 01:01:30.545
I had a friend tap in to Interpol's files.

01:01:30.547 --> 01:01:31.945
Despite your best efforts

01:01:31.947 --> 01:01:34.916
to conceal all your cash movements,

01:01:34.918 --> 01:01:36.851
they managed to track the money transfers

01:01:36.853 --> 01:01:38.519
you made to pay for the rent

01:01:38.521 --> 01:01:41.724
of the loft that you
used to launch the attack.

01:01:44.628 --> 01:01:45.963
Well, they identified two men.

01:01:47.130 --> 01:01:49.563
The first one,

01:01:49.565 --> 01:01:53.601
Leonard Lorenz. He's dead.

01:01:53.603 --> 01:01:54.972
You don't need to worry about him.

01:01:55.639 --> 01:01:57.771
And the second one,

01:01:57.773 --> 01:02:00.108
Fahim Al Saoud.

01:02:00.110 --> 01:02:02.075
He's still alive and he's
under heavy surveillance

01:02:02.077 --> 01:02:04.878
but I guess he doesn't even have a clue.

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:06.516
That's bad news...

01:02:08.117 --> 01:02:10.617
Fahim is instrumental in our plan.

01:02:10.619 --> 01:02:12.320
Now you're planning to kill more people?

01:02:12.322 --> 01:02:15.255
No, I swear.

01:02:15.257 --> 01:02:18.127
We're just gonna do
what we've always wanted.

01:02:19.563 --> 01:02:21.862
Free the Connected.

01:02:21.864 --> 01:02:24.000
This freedom you're offering.

01:02:25.068 --> 01:02:26.867
Is that what they really want?

01:02:26.869 --> 01:02:28.038
Everyone wants freedom.

01:02:28.804 --> 01:02:29.940
Are you sure?

01:02:32.175 --> 01:02:33.911
'Cause I don't know anymore.

01:02:39.949 --> 01:02:42.316
But I will help you.

01:02:42.318 --> 01:02:45.320
I think I know how to
make your friend Fahim

01:02:45.322 --> 01:02:47.825
get away from Interpol's surveillance.

01:02:52.929 --> 01:02:54.662
He received a message when he was online,

01:02:54.664 --> 01:02:56.934
telling him to go to
the Fontaine Sainte-Anne.

01:02:57.333 --> 01:02:59.833
Good.

01:02:59.835 --> 01:03:01.001
Put some men near the fountain.

01:03:01.003 --> 01:03:03.637
We'll follow him from here.

01:03:03.639 --> 01:03:05.942
Make sure the satellite is locked onto us.

01:03:06.809 --> 01:03:08.144
Yes, sir.

01:03:11.181 --> 01:03:12.282
There he is.

01:04:14.943 --> 01:04:17.244
Where did he go?

01:04:17.246 --> 01:04:18.748
Find him!

01:04:24.019 --> 01:04:25.887
Sir. A manhole.

01:04:25.889 --> 01:04:28.157
He must have fled down there.

01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:32.894
Leave it.

01:04:32.896 --> 01:04:34.231
Got to be far by now.

01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:38.932
Check the satellite history.

01:04:38.934 --> 01:04:41.170
I want to know who was here before him.

01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:59.155
Now watch your head.

01:05:21.077 --> 01:05:22.443
Thank you.

01:05:22.445 --> 01:05:24.945
That was well done.

01:05:24.947 --> 01:05:26.813
Fahim just needs to finish his work,

01:05:26.815 --> 01:05:29.751
and we'll be ready to take action.

01:05:29.753 --> 01:05:31.418
So, what's next?

01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:33.253
Would you be willing

01:05:33.255 --> 01:05:36.324
to check with your friend if
Interpol has anything else on us?

01:05:36.326 --> 01:05:39.228
I'd like to avoid any nasty surprises.

01:05:41.831 --> 01:05:43.367
Looks like I'm all in.

01:05:55.244 --> 01:05:57.144
If you think my booze is such shit,

01:05:57.146 --> 01:05:59.315
why do you insist on drinking it?

01:06:02.284 --> 01:06:04.251
You ever get the feeling
that you're being used?

01:06:04.253 --> 01:06:07.054
That you're nothing but a tool?

01:06:07.056 --> 01:06:08.856
Oh, you mean when people come

01:06:08.858 --> 01:06:10.258
knocking at your door all the time

01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:13.126
asking you for some illicit
stuff to be done for them?

01:06:13.128 --> 01:06:14.264
No...

01:06:16.132 --> 01:06:17.768
Not that way.

01:06:21.336 --> 01:06:23.271
I mean, it's...

01:06:23.273 --> 01:06:26.541
It's quite possible that my client

01:06:26.543 --> 01:06:29.075
has been using me for years.

01:06:29.077 --> 01:06:31.047
She's been manipulating me.

01:06:32.382 --> 01:06:33.514
But then there's

01:06:33.516 --> 01:06:35.318
these other guys that I'm helping

01:06:37.019 --> 01:06:39.153
and their fight is not really my fight.

01:06:39.155 --> 01:06:41.188
You're helping the Necromancers?

01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:42.490
Are you insane?

01:06:42.492 --> 01:06:44.161
No, I didn't say that.

01:06:47.130 --> 01:06:48.162
Yeah, I guess I said that.

01:06:48.164 --> 01:06:50.298
Look, you do as you want, okay.

01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:51.432
But if I were you,

01:06:51.434 --> 01:06:53.467
I would take the cash from
whatever corporation it is

01:06:53.469 --> 01:06:56.170
you're working for and I
wouldn't care about the rest.

01:06:56.172 --> 01:06:58.005
Our world is not to be repaired.

01:06:58.007 --> 01:06:59.240
We're way beyond that point.

01:06:59.242 --> 01:07:01.778
So, just accept it. You'll sleep better.

01:07:02.277 --> 01:07:03.279
Yeah.

01:07:04.347 --> 01:07:06.250
Yeah, maybe you're right.

01:07:10.987 --> 01:07:12.186
What if, maybe...

01:07:12.188 --> 01:07:15.389
It won't bring her back to you, Nash!

01:07:15.391 --> 01:07:17.961
Or to me, for that matter.

01:07:23.199 --> 01:07:25.166
So, did you get any information,

01:07:25.168 --> 01:07:27.171
anything on Interpol's servers?

01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:31.909
Yes, actually.

01:07:33.309 --> 01:07:35.208
They have an informant.

01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:38.112
Apparently someone who
works with the Necromancers.

01:07:38.114 --> 01:07:39.947
Something just popped up about

01:07:39.949 --> 01:07:41.481
them supposed to meet with him

01:07:41.483 --> 01:07:44.651
in one hour at the old City
Hall of 18th arrondissement.

01:07:44.653 --> 01:07:46.621
Now, that's not good news at all.

01:07:46.623 --> 01:07:48.358
You know, I'd better check it out.

01:08:38.073 --> 01:08:39.108
Go.

01:09:00.363 --> 01:09:01.965
Mr. Trenton...

01:09:05.368 --> 01:09:07.404
You can put those hands down now.

01:09:13.042 --> 01:09:15.312
I was expecting you, Mr. Trenton.

01:09:16.078 --> 01:09:17.344
Even though, of course,

01:09:17.345 --> 01:09:20.548
I couldn't be sure you would be showing up.

01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:23.084
It is always nice to
be given the opportunity

01:09:23.086 --> 01:09:26.154
to challenge one's own intuition.

01:09:27.488 --> 01:09:29.255
Have we met?

01:09:29.256 --> 01:09:30.657
No, we haven't.

01:09:30.658 --> 01:09:32.127
But I have seen you.

01:09:33.595 --> 01:09:35.430
Probably several times.

01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:38.665
And you are a bit of a mystery,

01:09:38.667 --> 01:09:40.603
to be honest, Mr. Trenton.

01:09:41.636 --> 01:09:43.439
That's what the ladies say.

01:09:45.041 --> 01:09:47.411
Although, coming from you,
it's a bit of a surprise.

01:09:48.609 --> 01:09:50.710
Well, you see,

01:09:50.712 --> 01:09:53.413
the history of the camera recording

01:09:53.416 --> 01:09:56.549
on the intersection
between Rue des Deux Freres

01:09:56.551 --> 01:09:59.620
and Rue Montaubard shows you,

01:09:59.622 --> 01:10:02.426
a few hours after a
certain cybertronic attack

01:10:03.559 --> 01:10:05.963
I'm sure you're aware of.

01:10:07.095 --> 01:10:09.362
A few other people are
also to be seen though.

01:10:09.364 --> 01:10:13.603
So, at that time, you
were just one among others.

01:10:15.137 --> 01:10:17.106
A face in the crowd.

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:22.108
But more recently, I happened
to lose a lead, under a bridge.

01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:25.715
And what do I see when I
check the satellite image?

01:10:27.382 --> 01:10:29.650
A few minutes before that,

01:10:29.652 --> 01:10:32.519
a guy who really looks like you,

01:10:32.521 --> 01:10:33.821
going under the same bridge,

01:10:33.823 --> 01:10:36.259
and never reappearing from it.

01:10:38.461 --> 01:10:40.227
Whoever disappeared our lead

01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:42.295
must have had access to our intel.

01:10:42.297 --> 01:10:45.402
So, all I had to do

01:10:46.335 --> 01:10:48.134
was to draft a note

01:10:48.136 --> 01:10:52.440
about some fake meeting with an informant

01:10:52.442 --> 01:10:55.442
and then wait and see who'd pay us a visit.

01:10:55.444 --> 01:11:00.683
Now, there is one thing I
don't understand about you.

01:11:02.685 --> 01:11:04.285
First, you're seen near the place

01:11:04.287 --> 01:11:05.619
from where Leonard Lorenz

01:11:05.621 --> 01:11:08.455
launched his cybertronic attack.

01:11:08.457 --> 01:11:11.291
Sometime later, we find him dead,

01:11:11.293 --> 01:11:14.163
along with three other corpses.

01:11:15.198 --> 01:11:16.700
No proof,

01:11:17.833 --> 01:11:20.867
but enough substantial evidence to conclude

01:11:20.869 --> 01:11:23.140
you're likely to have murdered them.

01:11:24.707 --> 01:11:27.441
Now, I've had your bank accounts checked.

01:11:27.443 --> 01:11:30.678
Your money always comes from
the same source, Synternis.

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:33.580
So, basically, you're easy to profile.

01:11:33.582 --> 01:11:35.652
You're one of their shadow agents.

01:11:36.351 --> 01:11:37.852
But then,

01:11:37.854 --> 01:11:41.455
and here comes the part that puzzles me,

01:11:41.457 --> 01:11:44.191
why help a terrorist to escape?

01:11:44.193 --> 01:11:46.861
Undercover work of some kind?

01:11:46.863 --> 01:11:48.629
I'm guessing this fantastic,

01:11:48.631 --> 01:11:53.666
incredibly long-winded
monologue has a point.

01:11:53.668 --> 01:11:56.806
You are conducting unauthorized
actions for Synternis,

01:11:57.606 --> 01:11:59.305
and by doing so,

01:11:59.307 --> 01:12:02.643
you are interfering with my investigation.

01:12:02.645 --> 01:12:04.344
So, what does that mean?

01:12:04.346 --> 01:12:06.679
Am I under arrest?

01:12:06.681 --> 01:12:10.151
Hmm, not necessarily, no.

01:12:10.153 --> 01:12:11.485
As for now,

01:12:11.487 --> 01:12:15.255
I haven't written anything
concerning you on my files.

01:12:15.257 --> 01:12:17.324
The Agency doesn't know

01:12:17.326 --> 01:12:19.226
about your involvement in this case.

01:12:19.228 --> 01:12:20.460
Nor do they know

01:12:20.462 --> 01:12:22.431
about Synternis'
involvement, for that matter.

01:12:24.199 --> 01:12:25.367
Why not?

01:12:26.502 --> 01:12:28.235
Ah.

01:12:28.237 --> 01:12:30.373
You want to negotiate something.

01:12:31.673 --> 01:12:34.775
That is so very astute of you, Mr. Trenton.

01:12:34.777 --> 01:12:36.378
Yes, indeed.

01:12:38.381 --> 01:12:39.479
What do you want?

01:12:39.481 --> 01:12:42.383
Straight to the point.

01:12:42.385 --> 01:12:47.187
Well, I want you to continue
working for Synternis,

01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:48.791
as you already do.

01:12:49.725 --> 01:12:51.525
But at the same time,

01:12:51.527 --> 01:12:54.695
I want you to work for us, from now on.

01:12:54.697 --> 01:12:58.435
Everything they learn, we learn it first.

01:12:59.502 --> 01:13:02.369
And before any drastic action,

01:13:02.371 --> 01:13:05.307
you must ask for our authorization.

01:13:06.208 --> 01:13:06.941
Okay.

01:13:06.943 --> 01:13:08.308
I'll see what I can...

01:13:22.257 --> 01:13:24.394
Nash? You're still alive?

01:13:25.728 --> 01:13:26.863
Barely.

01:13:27.697 --> 01:13:29.929
How did you know?

01:13:29.931 --> 01:13:32.433
We wanted to keep an eye on you.

01:13:32.435 --> 01:13:34.235
Just to be sure.

01:13:34.237 --> 01:13:35.402
When you left your friend's place,

01:13:35.404 --> 01:13:37.437
one of my men called me.

01:13:37.439 --> 01:13:39.440
I came to check.

01:13:39.442 --> 01:13:42.375
And when we saw these cops
with their guns aimed at you,

01:13:42.377 --> 01:13:44.313
we figured you needed some help.

01:13:45.381 --> 01:13:47.313
Thanks.

01:13:47.315 --> 01:13:48.816
I think we lost an opportunity.

01:13:48.818 --> 01:13:50.017
Which one?

01:13:50.019 --> 01:13:51.986
Having your two enemies,

01:13:51.988 --> 01:13:53.821
Synternis and Interpol,
fighting each other.

01:13:53.823 --> 01:13:56.022
It's no longer an option.

01:13:56.024 --> 01:13:59.492
Anyway, it doesn't change much now.

01:13:59.494 --> 01:14:01.327
Our plan is almost ready.

01:14:01.329 --> 01:14:04.266
Well, thanks to you, I think
I'm off the radar again.

01:14:05.467 --> 01:14:06.933
You know,

01:14:06.935 --> 01:14:09.637
it wouldn't be such a bad idea
to include me in your plan.

01:14:09.639 --> 01:14:10.803
Okay.

01:14:10.805 --> 01:14:12.505
Let's move first.

01:14:12.507 --> 01:14:14.344
Then I'll tell you.

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:26.053
I told you.

01:14:26.055 --> 01:14:28.725
We want to free the Connected.

01:14:29.792 --> 01:14:31.928
And we've finally found a way.

01:14:33.362 --> 01:14:37.363
We're going to launch a
virus that Fahim created.

01:14:37.365 --> 01:14:40.300
This program will progressively shut down

01:14:40.302 --> 01:14:44.373
every console, until the
verses themselves disappear.

01:14:46.408 --> 01:14:48.776
People will be forced offline.

01:14:48.778 --> 01:14:50.680
They'll get their lives back.

01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:54.647
They'll go out into the streets again.

01:14:54.649 --> 01:14:56.083
And live.

01:14:56.085 --> 01:15:00.256
We're talking about a worldwide revolution.

01:15:00.922 --> 01:15:02.423
Worldwide?

01:15:02.425 --> 01:15:03.426
Yes.

01:15:07.697 --> 01:15:11.400
There's just one problem.

01:15:13.668 --> 01:15:14.604
Imagine that.

01:15:16.072 --> 01:15:18.972
In order to be able to
replicate and spread,

01:15:18.974 --> 01:15:21.842
we need the virus to be
launched from within the matrix

01:15:21.844 --> 01:15:23.710
of one of the main verses.

01:15:23.712 --> 01:15:24.911
Which means?

01:15:24.913 --> 01:15:25.946
Which means

01:15:25.948 --> 01:15:27.348
we need it to be launched

01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:30.451
from inside Synternis headquarters.

01:15:30.453 --> 01:15:31.652
That's where you come in.

01:15:31.654 --> 01:15:32.686
No, no, no.

01:15:32.688 --> 01:15:34.420
I'm not a programmer.

01:15:34.422 --> 01:15:35.856
I don't have the first
damn clue about hacking.

01:15:35.858 --> 01:15:37.558
You don't need to.

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:41.527
Just take this device with
you the next time you go there.

01:15:41.529 --> 01:15:43.030
All you need to do

01:15:43.032 --> 01:15:45.499
is stay near a high clearance
computer long enough.

01:15:45.501 --> 01:15:48.869
From there, our hackers
will blow the protections.

01:15:48.871 --> 01:15:51.871
Then, the virus will be launched.

01:15:51.873 --> 01:15:53.874
It'll attack progressively.

01:15:53.876 --> 01:15:55.442
By the time the shutdown really begins,

01:15:55.444 --> 01:15:58.379
you won't even be in the building anymore.

01:15:58.381 --> 01:16:00.317
Nothing will connect you to the attack.

01:16:02.717 --> 01:16:04.918
Get some rest.

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:07.120
Our team needs to prepare.

01:16:07.122 --> 01:16:10.391
In a few hours, we'll be ready.

01:16:10.393 --> 01:16:12.729
Let us know when you're going
to Synternis headquarters.

01:16:14.729 --> 01:16:16.332
This is an important moment.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.037
Tomorrow, the world will be very different.

01:16:22.137 --> 01:16:25.375
All of the verses will
have ceased to exist.

01:16:26.975 --> 01:16:28.711
All of them?

01:16:29.811 --> 01:16:31.747
All the major ones, yes.

01:16:42.625 --> 01:16:44.360
Let's get ready.

01:16:56.704 --> 01:16:58.037
<i>I am no hero.</i>

01:16:58.039 --> 01:16:59.940
<i>Never was. Never will be.</i>

01:16:59.942 --> 01:17:01.511
<i>That just isn't me.</i>

01:17:03.179 --> 01:17:05.077
<i>Many centuries of evolution</i>

01:17:05.079 --> 01:17:07.516
<i>to end up like vegetables
wired to machines.</i>

01:17:08.850 --> 01:17:10.017
<i>I don't know if a God exists,</i>

01:17:10.019 --> 01:17:13.586
<i>or if there is a purpose
to our existence.</i>

01:17:13.588 --> 01:17:15.155
<i>But if there is,</i>

01:17:15.157 --> 01:17:17.961
<i>you can bet it's not to
become such derelicts.</i>

01:17:20.195 --> 01:17:21.629
<i>Then again,</i>

01:17:21.631 --> 01:17:25.031
<i>no one was forcing anyone
to spend their life online.</i>

01:17:25.033 --> 01:17:27.800
<i>That was the people's choice.</i>

01:17:27.802 --> 01:17:30.739
<i>Is it possible to force
people into freedom?</i>

01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:33.639
<i>And if it is,</i>

01:17:33.641 --> 01:17:34.778
<i>should it be done?</i>

01:17:53.561 --> 01:17:54.697
Are you okay?

01:17:55.930 --> 01:17:58.067
You really seem elsewhere.

01:18:02.770 --> 01:18:05.442
How would you describe our relationship?

01:18:07.109 --> 01:18:08.111
Love?

01:18:10.912 --> 01:18:13.580
Why give names?

01:18:13.582 --> 01:18:15.018
That was good for the old world.

01:18:16.252 --> 01:18:18.455
Now, online, we don't need this.

01:18:23.725 --> 01:18:25.759
I am well with you.

01:18:25.761 --> 01:18:27.130
You're well with me.

01:18:28.264 --> 01:18:29.899
It's all that matters.

01:21:47.296 --> 01:21:48.928
What the hell?

01:21:48.930 --> 01:21:51.197
Who are those guys?

01:21:51.199 --> 01:21:53.299
They want to shut everything down?

01:21:53.301 --> 01:21:54.334
They're crazy!

01:21:54.336 --> 01:21:55.968
We have to stop them.

01:21:55.970 --> 01:21:57.970
Wait, look.

01:21:57.972 --> 01:22:00.874
Some players from the Falchion
Guild have located them.

01:22:00.876 --> 01:22:02.808
They're in Neo Paris.

01:22:02.810 --> 01:22:04.311
Here is their address.

01:22:04.313 --> 01:22:07.347
Players from the whole verse
are sending messages about it.

01:22:07.349 --> 01:22:09.886
They're calling everyone
in Neo Paris to intervene.

01:24:00.595 --> 01:24:02.995
<i>This freedom you're offering.</i>

01:24:02.997 --> 01:24:04.464
<i>Is that what they really want?</i>

01:24:04.466 --> 01:24:06.465
<i>Everyone wants freedom.</i>

01:24:06.467 --> 01:24:08.902
<i>Are you sure?</i>

01:24:08.904 --> 01:24:10.273
<i>'Cause I don't know anymore.</i>

01:24:24.152 --> 01:24:25.619
Do you know what happened?

01:24:25.621 --> 01:24:26.887
I was online.

01:24:26.889 --> 01:24:29.089
I followed it from there.

01:24:29.091 --> 01:24:33.093
The Necromancers tried to free
the gamers against their will.

01:24:33.095 --> 01:24:34.393
It's ironic, isn't it?

01:24:34.395 --> 01:24:35.629
In order to free them,

01:24:35.631 --> 01:24:36.963
they had to force them to do

01:24:36.965 --> 01:24:39.098
the very thing they didn't want to do.

01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:41.902
Which is quite the opposite
of being free, isn't it?

01:24:41.904 --> 01:24:43.035
I see your point.

01:24:43.037 --> 01:24:45.272
Anyway, the cell has been destroyed.

01:24:45.274 --> 01:24:48.275
We found the bodies and the computers.

01:24:48.277 --> 01:24:51.010
And the identity of the remaining members.

01:24:51.012 --> 01:24:53.213
Most importantly, we have crushed them.

01:24:53.215 --> 01:24:54.613
They were given the proof

01:24:54.615 --> 01:24:57.384
that the people will not follow them.

01:24:57.386 --> 01:25:01.120
All this to say that your mission is over.

01:25:01.122 --> 01:25:03.123
You will get paid the rest of your money

01:25:03.125 --> 01:25:04.391
for the four Necromancers

01:25:04.393 --> 01:25:06.229
you've eliminated within the week.

01:25:10.332 --> 01:25:12.632
Oh, Nash...

01:25:12.634 --> 01:25:16.669
Our programmers have conclusive evidence

01:25:16.671 --> 01:25:19.004
that the virus that was launched

01:25:19.006 --> 01:25:20.205
could only have succeeded

01:25:20.207 --> 01:25:22.411
via a relay inside our headquarters.

01:25:24.112 --> 01:25:25.378
I take it as a coincidence

01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:27.213
that you happened to have been there

01:25:27.215 --> 01:25:29.051
right before the attack.

01:25:29.650 --> 01:25:32.085
Wrong place, wrong time.

01:25:32.087 --> 01:25:34.353
Story of my life.

01:25:34.355 --> 01:25:38.391
You do know if I was to
start an investigation,

01:25:38.393 --> 01:25:39.592
and it was to prove

01:25:39.594 --> 01:25:42.195
that you had anything
to do with this attack,

01:25:42.197 --> 01:25:45.167
the most probable outcome
would be the death penalty?

01:25:47.168 --> 01:25:48.170
I do.

01:25:50.404 --> 01:25:51.907
I won't, though.

01:25:53.207 --> 01:25:55.709
This case is closed.

01:25:55.711 --> 01:25:58.445
I have enjoyed working with you.

01:25:58.447 --> 01:26:00.647
But our collaboration is over.

01:26:00.649 --> 01:26:03.415
You are not to be allowed
in these offices again.

01:26:03.417 --> 01:26:05.220
And it's best that we never hear from you.

01:26:06.688 --> 01:26:08.420
Do we have an understanding?

01:26:08.422 --> 01:26:10.522
I believe we do, yes.

01:26:10.524 --> 01:26:15.027
Good. Nash, I have a question.

01:26:15.029 --> 01:26:19.199
You, of all people, I would have
thought wouldn't have turned.

01:26:19.201 --> 01:26:20.467
I am not saying that you did.

01:26:20.469 --> 01:26:22.468
But if you had,

01:26:22.470 --> 01:26:24.039
what would have convinced you?

01:26:27.743 --> 01:26:29.078
I don't know.

01:26:31.078 --> 01:26:33.345
Maybe learning that the
virus which killed Helena

01:26:33.347 --> 01:26:35.647
was created by Synternis.

01:26:35.649 --> 01:26:37.549
Is that what they told you?

01:26:37.551 --> 01:26:39.387
That we killed Helena?

01:26:40.521 --> 01:26:42.589
Yes, we created the virus.

01:26:42.591 --> 01:26:44.424
But if you had looked at our history,

01:26:44.426 --> 01:26:45.759
you would have seen

01:26:45.761 --> 01:26:48.727
that the Necromancers
designed their own version

01:26:48.729 --> 01:26:51.764
of the virus months before Helena's death.

01:26:51.766 --> 01:26:54.334
She was working for us.

01:26:54.336 --> 01:26:57.437
She was infiltrating
potential troublemakers online,

01:26:57.439 --> 01:26:59.205
when they found out,

01:26:59.207 --> 01:27:00.343
and eliminated her.

01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:03.742
I don't know who to believe.

01:27:03.744 --> 01:27:06.178
I told you the truth, Nash.

01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:08.384
What you believe is up to you.

01:27:09.650 --> 01:27:11.116
You've made enough money

01:27:11.118 --> 01:27:13.255
to have a comfortable life, online and off.

01:27:16.224 --> 01:27:17.592
Farewell, Nash.

01:27:18.659 --> 01:27:20.395
Farewell, Dina.

01:27:57.332 --> 01:28:00.366
<i>Camylle was expecting a revolution.</i>

01:28:00.368 --> 01:28:03.202
<i>But as I said at the
beginning of this story,</i>

01:28:03.204 --> 01:28:05.140
<i>the revolution already happened.</i>

01:28:08.409 --> 01:28:12.213
<i>And we were too damn
busy to notice it.</i>

01:28:17.385 --> 01:28:18.684
<i>Dina was right.</i>

01:28:18.686 --> 01:28:21.854
<i>I was in a position of
choosing a comfortable life.</i>

01:28:21.856 --> 01:28:25.261
<i>Nothing was keeping me
in the old world anymore.</i>

01:28:26.795 --> 01:28:29.632
<i>So, I decided to
stop being a Hybrid.</i>

01:28:30.564 --> 01:28:32.100
<i>Too painful.</i>

01:28:32.868 --> 01:28:34.767
<i>I'm a Connected now,</i>

01:28:34.769 --> 01:28:37.570
<i>like most of the population.</i>

01:28:37.572 --> 01:28:39.606
<i>The money I earned
allows me to add features</i>

01:28:39.608 --> 01:28:44.410
<i>that make me enjoy the
experience even more fully.</i>

01:28:44.412 --> 01:28:48.447
<i>And who's to say that what
I'm experiencing isn't real?</i>

01:28:48.449 --> 01:28:50.349
<i>Studies from the
beginning of the century</i>

01:28:50.351 --> 01:28:52.251
<i>prove that the brain
couldn't make a difference</i>

01:28:52.253 --> 01:28:54.620
<i>between real and virtual.</i>

01:28:54.622 --> 01:28:57.757
<i>Your brain secretes the same
hormones in the same quantity</i>

01:28:57.759 --> 01:29:00.226
<i>if you are seeing
real friends you like,</i>

01:29:00.228 --> 01:29:01.693
<i>or if you are watching a TV show</i>

01:29:01.695 --> 01:29:04.496
<i>with characters that you enjoy,</i>

01:29:04.498 --> 01:29:07.433
<i>in the same quantity.</i>

01:29:07.435 --> 01:29:11.638
<i>So, if my brain is telling me
that what I'm living is real,</i>

01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:14.443
<i>who the hell are you to
tell me that it's not?</i>
