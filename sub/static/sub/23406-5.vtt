WEBVTT

00:10.586 --> 00:13.448
- Oh, I'll have
a Bloody Mary. Thanks.

00:13.551 --> 00:15.103
Oh, I wonder if
the hotel has a pool.

00:15.206 --> 00:16.448
- Matt, no. I forbid you
to go swimming.

00:16.551 --> 00:19.586
This is the corporate retreat,
not MTV's Spring Break.

00:19.689 --> 00:21.827
- Jake, this is the closest
I've had to a vacation in years.

00:21.931 --> 00:23.413
All I wanna do
is have some fun

00:23.517 --> 00:25.034
and maybe
drunkenly say something

00:25.137 --> 00:27.137
way too personal to a coworker
that I'll always regret.

00:27.241 --> 00:29.137
- Matt, look. This weekend
is about one thing:

00:29.241 --> 00:30.724
forming superficial
relationships with people

00:30.827 --> 00:33.724
you can exploit in the future.
It's called networking.

00:33.827 --> 00:36.206
- "Shirley Moser,
SVP Marketing.

00:36.310 --> 00:37.206
"Son banned from Wal-Mart

00:37.310 --> 00:40.862
after Sudafed incident"?
What is this?

00:40.965 --> 00:42.034
- It's everyone I met at
last year's retreat.

00:42.137 --> 00:43.965
Names, emails, and one
dark secret per person

00:44.068 --> 00:45.413
for possible
future blackmailing.

00:45.517 --> 00:48.000
- Well, you're
a well-organized sociopath.

00:48.103 --> 00:49.344
- If you're over 30 and
don't have a spreadsheet

00:49.448 --> 00:51.206
of everyone you've ever met,
you're behind in life.

00:51.310 --> 00:53.965
- I'm so bad with names.
And faces.

00:54.068 --> 00:56.241
I have close friends
whose names I don't know.

00:56.344 --> 00:58.724
- Oh, my God!

01:00.068 --> 01:02.000
- I knew it! I knew
our pilot sucked.

01:02.103 --> 01:03.517
He was too folksy
on the PA.

01:03.620 --> 01:05.758
- Jake, I just want you
to know that you're

01:05.862 --> 01:09.034
my best friend--at work.
You're my best work friend.

01:09.137 --> 01:10.793
- Oh, my God!
I've wasted my whole life!

01:13.793 --> 01:14.689
-  I forgive you.

01:14.793 --> 01:17.034
- Are we... Okay?

01:18.068 --> 01:18.896
-  Good news.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.724
That crash you just experienced

01:20.827 --> 01:22.275
was just a simulation.

01:22.379 --> 01:26.724
- Surprise! And our apologies
if you were traumatized.

01:26.827 --> 01:28.379
- Fun fact: Coworkers
who have co-survived

01:28.482 --> 01:30.689
a near-death experience
are more bonded

01:30.793 --> 01:33.517
than coworkers who have
not almost co-died together.

01:33.620 --> 01:37.379
- So, congrats! Oh,
and if your final thoughts

01:37.482 --> 01:40.482
weren't of Hampton DeVille,
then you've got a lot

01:40.586 --> 01:42.655
of work to do this weekend.
Happy retreat!

02:02.827 --> 02:06.448
- Hello, and welcome,
Hampton DeVillionaires...

02:07.724 --> 02:09.034
- To the first day
of the rest

02:09.137 --> 02:10.241
of your corporate lives.

02:10.344 --> 02:11.931
- Now, go ahead,
put your hands together

02:12.034 --> 02:13.655
for "Inside Trader"
magazine's

02:13.758 --> 02:16.034
most motivating
motivational speakers

02:16.137 --> 02:20.931
of 2012, 2013,
and 2K-16...

02:21.034 --> 02:24.103
both:
Jeff and Gretchen Palmer!

02:32.344 --> 02:33.827
- Re-certivity!

02:33.931 --> 02:35.793
- Re-turbulation.

02:35.896 --> 02:37.586
- Acrownting.

02:37.689 --> 02:38.689
- Analystix.

02:38.793 --> 02:42.758
- Constanceuance.
- Inter-trans-deviation.

02:42.862 --> 02:44.758
both: Sporg.

02:44.862 --> 02:47.931
- None of those words
made any sense, right?

02:48.034 --> 02:50.172
But you listened to them.
Why?

02:50.275 --> 02:52.137
Because we said them
with confidence.

02:53.517 --> 02:55.241
- That's not funny.

02:55.344 --> 02:56.724
- Just laugh. If you
pretend to be brainwashed,

02:56.827 --> 02:59.206
they can't brainwash you.

02:59.310 --> 03:01.344
- "Team." That's a real word,
isn't it, Jeff?

03:01.448 --> 03:04.137
- That's right, Gretch.
In fact, every corporation

03:04.241 --> 03:05.724
is kind of like a team,
right?

03:05.827 --> 03:07.827
Hell, every marriage
is like a team, right, hon?

03:07.931 --> 03:11.965
- And my husband Jeff and I
are the ultimate team.

03:12.068 --> 03:13.862
Do you wanna know why?

03:13.965 --> 03:16.413
Do you want to know why?

03:16.517 --> 03:19.000
Because we are total...

03:19.103 --> 03:20.965
both: AHOLEs!

03:21.068 --> 03:22.068
- That's right!

03:22.172 --> 03:24.379
"Alphas Who Only
Like Excellence."

03:24.482 --> 03:27.482
That's what we are,
and that's what you can be.

03:27.586 --> 03:32.241
Who out there, Hampton DeVille,
wants to be an AHOLE?

03:32.344 --> 03:34.862
Come on! Anybody?

03:34.965 --> 03:36.655
- What are you doing?
Never participate.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.793
- Hey, how about you?
All right, this guy!

03:42.172 --> 03:44.689
All right, look at
this big, tall giraffe.

03:44.793 --> 03:45.862
Okay?

03:45.965 --> 03:48.137
Tell everyone your name,
you big, tall giraffe.

03:48.241 --> 03:49.034
- Uh, it's Matt.

03:49.137 --> 03:52.000
Human being,
not a giraffe.

03:54.172 --> 03:56.896
- All right. Hey,
took a lot of courage

03:57.000 --> 03:58.379
to volunteer like that,
Matt.

03:58.482 --> 04:00.931
- Oh, yeah, no. I mean,
all I did was raise my hand.

04:01.034 --> 04:02.310
It's not rocket science, right?

04:04.310 --> 04:07.206
- Okay, Matt.
Um, let's go ahead,

04:07.310 --> 04:09.310
and let's do
a little hypothetical.

04:09.413 --> 04:12.586
Let's say you're at
a restaurant, and you find

04:12.689 --> 04:14.517
a little hair
inside of your food.

04:14.620 --> 04:17.310
How do you handle
that situation?

04:17.413 --> 04:19.827
- Oh, I mean, I'd probably
just take the hair out

04:19.931 --> 04:21.241
and still eat the food.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.068
I don't sweat the small stuff.

04:23.172 --> 04:24.482
- Oh.
- Wow.

04:24.586 --> 04:25.586
- Wow. That truly is amazing.

04:25.689 --> 04:27.655
Let's applaud for that.
That's amazing.

04:27.758 --> 04:31.827
- Yeah, yeah. That's amazing.
You know why it's amazing?

04:31.931 --> 04:34.758
'Cause I've never seen
raw human dog shit talk.

04:37.241 --> 04:39.413
- What?
- Whoa, he keeps making noises!

04:39.517 --> 04:41.000
This is some talkative
dog shit.

04:42.517 --> 04:43.620
- Seriously, Matt.

04:43.724 --> 04:46.000
I mean, you must really
think of yourself as

04:46.103 --> 04:48.931
unflushed toilet water
to think that you deserve

04:49.034 --> 04:51.379
to eat food with hair in it.

04:51.482 --> 04:53.862
I think that
it is clear to me,

04:53.965 --> 04:57.068
to my baby Jeff,
to everyone in this room,

04:57.172 --> 04:59.172
that you are
a very weak person.

04:59.275 --> 05:01.448
Would you agree
with that statement?

05:01.551 --> 05:02.827
- No, I don't think so.

05:02.931 --> 05:05.241
- Wrong answer,
toilet giraffe.

05:05.344 --> 05:07.448
But guess what?
We are gonna mold you

05:07.551 --> 05:11.620
from a weak pile
of dog shit into an...

05:11.724 --> 05:14.034
both: AHOLE!
- Yeah!

05:15.068 --> 05:18.379
- Yeah!
Come on, guys.

05:19.620 --> 05:20.482
- Am I a weak person?

05:20.586 --> 05:22.793
- Well, you're definitely weak.

05:22.896 --> 05:24.068
I don't know
if you're a person.

05:24.172 --> 05:27.275
- I just always thought
of myself as confident.

05:27.379 --> 05:28.724
You think I'm confident,
right, Jake?

05:28.827 --> 05:31.103
- No.
- Okay, that's fair.

05:31.206 --> 05:32.275
- Now let's get dressed.

05:32.379 --> 05:33.965
We're going
to the networking mixer.

05:34.068 --> 05:35.379
-  I'm not really
in a networking mood.

05:35.482 --> 05:37.344
The whole company thinks
I'm a toilet giraffe.

05:37.448 --> 05:39.241
I think I'm just gonna
go to the pool.

05:39.344 --> 05:40.862
- Nobody's ever in
a networking mood.

05:40.965 --> 05:42.413
It's just something we do
to survive,

05:42.517 --> 05:44.034
like lying to your therapist.

05:44.137 --> 05:47.172
Now let's go trick
some people into liking us.

05:47.275 --> 05:51.103
-  Oh...
Okay.

05:57.620 --> 05:58.965
- And how's that lovely
girlfriend of yours, Seth?

05:59.068 --> 06:00.724
And how's that adorable son
of yours, Connie?

06:00.827 --> 06:02.172
And how's
your prostate, Jerry?

06:02.275 --> 06:05.068
- And how's that adorable little
daughter of yours, Melanie?

06:05.172 --> 06:08.206
- Dead.
And my name is Julie.

06:08.310 --> 06:09.413
- ♪ Oh, my God

06:09.517 --> 06:10.965

06:11.068 --> 06:13.000

Do you wanna network
with me?

06:20.517 --> 06:22.310
- Great.
- You know what, never mind.

06:28.310 --> 06:30.241
I'm sorry, I don't know
why I'm apologizing so much,

06:30.344 --> 06:32.689
but I've been saying sorry
to a lot of people tonight.

06:34.655 --> 06:37.551
Hopefully we can be
business partners, or...

06:37.655 --> 06:39.275
We can stay in touch.
We'll stay in touch.

06:39.379 --> 06:41.000
I'll put you

07:06.034 --> 07:07.206
and good luck
with your worm farm!

07:07.310 --> 07:10.448
Hey, my contacts!

07:10.551 --> 07:12.793
- Pssh. Bill Patterson?
He'll give his card

07:12.896 --> 07:15.103
to the bathroom attendant.
- Well, I have a comprehensive

07:15.206 --> 07:17.172
Excel spreadsheet
with over 500 names, emails,

07:17.275 --> 07:19.482
and personal details, so
I think I know how to network.

07:19.586 --> 07:22.965
- Excel, huh? That's cute.
I use Google Docs myself

07:23.068 --> 07:24.931
'cause I'm actually serious
about networking.

07:27.689 --> 07:30.241
"Jake Levinson, Junior
Executive in Training."

07:30.344 --> 07:31.758
Pleasure to meet you.

07:31.862 --> 07:35.724
- "Natasha Riggs, Junior VP
of HD Analytics." Same.

07:36.965 --> 07:38.344
I'd love to
keep in touch, Natasha.

07:38.448 --> 07:41.137
- Are you trying
to network with me?

07:41.241 --> 07:43.103
- Abso-fucking-lutely.

07:46.862 --> 07:48.379
- I didn't know you laugh.

07:48.482 --> 07:50.620
- I do. Hey, I'll have
another piña colada.

07:50.724 --> 07:52.034
- Make it two.
- You know, John, it has

07:52.137 --> 07:53.758
been great to get to know you
outside the office,

07:53.862 --> 07:55.758
get to know the real you,
et cetera.

07:55.862 --> 07:57.689
Along those lines,
here's an idea--

07:57.793 --> 07:58.827
and I'm open
to discussion on it.

07:58.931 --> 08:01.310
- Okay.
- What if we fucked?

08:01.413 --> 08:03.689
- Huh.
Well, that's interesting.

08:03.793 --> 08:05.724
I'm definitely open
to the idea.

08:05.827 --> 08:07.517
Should we maybe make a list
of pros and cons?

08:07.620 --> 08:08.689
- Oh, yeah.
Excellent suggestion.

08:08.793 --> 08:10.206
- Great.
- Okay, here's a pro.

08:10.310 --> 08:11.655
Retreat sex
is the best sex.

08:11.758 --> 08:14.448
- True. Pro:
Sex between us could be

08:14.551 --> 08:16.448
a team-building exercise.
- True.

08:16.551 --> 08:17.551
Now here's a con.

08:17.655 --> 08:18.827
Sex could be
the biggest mistake

08:18.931 --> 08:20.448
of our lives.
- Oh, for sure.

08:20.551 --> 08:22.275
- Excuse me, bartender?
Excuse me.

08:22.379 --> 08:24.413
- Bartender! Bourbon, neat,

08:24.517 --> 08:27.586
and a vodka soda with two limes
for my lady. Thank you, sir.

08:27.689 --> 08:29.586
Oh, hey, Matt.
Didn't see you there at all.

08:29.689 --> 08:31.413
Do you want something
from the bar?

08:31.517 --> 08:33.275
I've got the
bartender's attention.

08:33.379 --> 08:34.586
- Guess I'll take a whiskey.

08:34.689 --> 08:37.275
- Whiskey, please.
For my friend.

08:37.379 --> 08:40.068
- Hey. Sorry for singling you
out back there before.

08:40.172 --> 08:41.896
I know that can feel
pretty embarrassing,

08:42.000 --> 08:43.310
but it really is
a good thing.

08:43.413 --> 08:45.689
- First step to being
a fully confident human being

08:45.793 --> 08:47.551
is to be truly ashamed
of yourself.

08:47.655 --> 08:49.482
We're actually throwing
a seminar tomorrow

08:49.586 --> 08:50.827
for the highers-up.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.241
If you want to join,
there's an open slot.

08:53.344 --> 08:55.448
- Why? So you can call me
"dog shit giraffe" again?

08:55.551 --> 08:58.586
Uh, no, probably not.

08:58.689 --> 09:00.965
Look, there is something
truly great in you.

09:01.068 --> 09:03.000
You just gotta
tap that potential.

09:03.103 --> 09:05.586
- Seminar's tomorrow at
9:00 a.m. by the swimming pond.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.620
Let's pretend
this is a safe space.

09:10.724 --> 09:12.758
Sharing intimate secrets
with coworkers can

09:12.862 --> 09:14.689
bond us together
and increase communication

09:14.793 --> 09:16.586
in the workplace.

09:16.689 --> 09:19.793
- Now, who wants to share first?

09:21.137 --> 09:23.551
- I never admitted this before,
but...

09:23.655 --> 09:27.689
I hate my grandkids.
They just suck.

09:27.793 --> 09:31.275
- One time I hit a deer
with my car...

09:31.379 --> 09:32.793
because I wanted to.

09:32.896 --> 09:36.137
- Look, I am just gonna
say this: I am a cutter,

09:36.241 --> 09:37.586
and that works for me.

09:37.689 --> 09:39.655
- And that's when I realized

09:39.758 --> 09:44.551
I had inadvertently
helped do 9/11.

09:44.655 --> 09:46.275
- Beautiful.
- So, so great. Gorgeous.

09:46.379 --> 09:49.344
Let's all give Ted
a big round of applause

09:49.448 --> 09:52.517
and help him
feel supported.

09:52.620 --> 09:54.965
- Support Ted.

09:55.068 --> 09:57.275
Okay, seems like
everyone has shared.

09:57.379 --> 09:59.655
Except for you, Matt.

09:59.758 --> 10:03.068
Matt, why so shy?

10:03.172 --> 10:05.655
- Oh, yeah, I-I don't
really know if this is for me.

10:05.758 --> 10:07.344
I might just go for a swim.

10:07.448 --> 10:08.655
- Come on, Matt.
We've all shared

10:08.758 --> 10:11.517
with each other,
except for you.

10:11.620 --> 10:13.068
Just tell us something simple.
Be confident.

10:13.172 --> 10:16.000
Like, how did you lose
your virginity?

10:16.103 --> 10:18.827
- Oh. Uh...

10:18.931 --> 10:23.344
Okay.
Well, I was in college,

10:23.448 --> 10:26.827
and it was Halloween night,
and we were watching a movie.

10:26.931 --> 10:30.344
- Spooky. What movie?

10:30.448 --> 10:32.206
- I'd rather not say.

10:32.310 --> 10:34.310
both: Come on, come on.

10:34.413 --> 10:36.586
- It was "Hocus Pocus."

10:36.689 --> 10:38.620
- Excellent film.

10:38.724 --> 10:40.655
- Anyway, I got distracted
by the movie,

10:40.758 --> 10:41.689
and it lasted
way too long,

10:41.793 --> 10:44.517
and that's
the end of that story.

10:44.620 --> 10:46.931
- No, no, no, no.
It's not, Matt.

10:47.034 --> 10:48.793
We gotta go
way, way deeper.

10:49.793 --> 10:51.034
Way deeper.

10:56.758 --> 10:59.137
- I fully trust you
with my heart and mind

10:59.241 --> 11:01.655
to close-shave me
with a straight-edge razor.

11:01.758 --> 11:02.896
- I accept and honor
your trust

11:03.000 --> 11:05.241
and wish you
the very best of luck.

11:05.344 --> 11:06.551
- Well, look who's here.

11:06.655 --> 11:08.068
- Ow, my face.

11:08.172 --> 11:09.965
- Oh, sorry, Cliff,
but you moved.

11:10.068 --> 11:11.655
- Didn't think
you were the trust-shave,

11:11.758 --> 11:13.068
team-building type.

11:13.172 --> 11:14.758
- Oh, so you were
thinking about me.

11:14.862 --> 11:16.827
Now I have a personal tidbit
to put about you in

11:16.931 --> 11:19.310
my Excel spreadsheet:
"Thinks about Jake... A lot."

11:19.413 --> 11:22.931
- And I have something to put
about you in my Google Doc:

11:23.034 --> 11:26.620
"Suffers from narcissistic
personality disorder."

11:26.724 --> 11:27.620
Wanna get out of here?

11:27.724 --> 11:31.482
- Fine. Twist my arm.

11:31.586 --> 11:34.344
- Jake?

11:36.172 --> 11:38.172
I fully trust you
with my heart and mind.

11:38.275 --> 11:41.862
- And then Bette Midler
sang a Broadway rendition

11:41.965 --> 11:44.931
of "I Put a Spell on You,"
and then I, uh--

11:45.034 --> 11:47.275
- Give it to us, Matt.
- Share, Matt.

11:47.379 --> 11:48.758
- I camed.

11:50.793 --> 11:53.206
- Good work, Matt.
Good work.

11:53.310 --> 11:54.827
- Give Matt a hug.
Show him some support.

11:54.931 --> 11:56.896
- Everybody touch his body.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.965
Wrap your arms around his neck
and love him.

12:04.034 --> 12:05.793
- So, yeah, basically,
I analyze data,

12:05.896 --> 12:07.413
and I put it into graphs
and whatever.

12:07.517 --> 12:08.896
I'm extremely good at it,

12:09.000 --> 12:11.620
and I wake up every morning
wanting to die.

12:11.724 --> 12:14.758
- You wanna die?
I wanna die.

12:14.862 --> 12:18.000
- We have so much in common.
- Mm-hmm.

12:18.103 --> 12:21.068
I bet we're missing some
great seminars right now.

12:21.172 --> 12:23.344
- Oh, yeah. I had my eyes
on the "How to Embezzle Money

12:23.448 --> 12:25.000
While Still Looking
Really Awesome" seminar,

12:25.103 --> 12:26.827
but I already kind of
know how to do that.

12:26.931 --> 12:30.413
- Ooh, we're not
the only ones playing hooky.

12:30.517 --> 12:32.517
See that redheaded guy
about to dive in?

12:32.620 --> 12:34.620
- Mm-hmm.
- Greg Wilkins, chief of

12:34.724 --> 12:36.758
product development,
HD San Francisco.

12:36.862 --> 12:38.655
- And he cheats on his wife
with Julie Powell,

12:38.758 --> 12:40.137
VP Hampton DeVille,
west Oregon.

12:40.241 --> 12:42.034
- Hmm.

12:42.137 --> 12:43.620
- You're not married, are you?

12:43.724 --> 12:46.068
- No, I'm not,
which severely decreases

12:46.172 --> 12:48.758
the chances that we'll
have sex on this retreat.

12:50.379 --> 12:53.275
- Wait, Mark Cuban,
Condoleezza Rice,

12:53.379 --> 12:54.689
and the Barefoot Contessa
are all AHOLEs?

12:54.793 --> 12:57.068
- Mm-hmm, and
her husband Jeffrey.

12:57.172 --> 12:58.896
Really, you're no different
from any of them, Matt.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.620
- We think
you're special, Matt.

13:00.724 --> 13:02.586
I can feel
your confidence growing.

13:02.689 --> 13:05.517
Just a few more exercises
and you'll be a full AHOLE.

13:05.620 --> 13:07.689
- Oh yeah. Big-time AHOLE.

13:07.793 --> 13:09.172
Come on, let's pray.

13:09.275 --> 13:13.206
Heavenly Father, thank you
for giving me the confidence

13:13.310 --> 13:15.862
to purchase this food
with my hard-earned money,

13:15.965 --> 13:18.172
which I got without
any of your help,

13:18.275 --> 13:21.000
because you don't exist.
Amen.

13:21.103 --> 13:22.275
- Amen!
- Amen.

13:22.379 --> 13:23.724
- Let's eat.

13:26.793 --> 13:29.448
- Ew, gross.
There's a hair in my food.

13:29.551 --> 13:32.000
- Oh. Yeah, gross.

13:32.103 --> 13:33.000
I guess mistakes happen,
huh?

13:33.103 --> 13:35.103
Look, why don't
you just throw it out

13:35.206 --> 13:36.413
and move on with your life,
like you said, right?

13:37.896 --> 13:41.310
- N--no. I deserve
better than this.

13:41.413 --> 13:45.517
I'm gonna say something.
Excuse me, waitress?

13:45.620 --> 13:48.655
There's a problem with my food,
when you get a second.

13:48.758 --> 13:50.172
- Can I help you, sir?

13:50.275 --> 13:51.689
- I certainly hope
you can help me.

13:51.793 --> 13:54.655
Look at this hair.
My dinner is ruined.

13:54.758 --> 13:55.793
- Stronger, Matt.

13:55.896 --> 13:57.862
- I mean, you ruined it.

13:57.965 --> 13:59.551
You ruined my dinner.

13:59.655 --> 14:02.758
- I'm terribly sorry, sir.
I'll get you a new Cobb salad.

14:02.862 --> 14:05.448
- No, let me finish.
I'm a human being

14:05.551 --> 14:09.448
and essentially an executive,
and I deserve respect.

14:09.551 --> 14:11.896
- Of course, sir.
I'll comp the salad and then...

14:12.000 --> 14:13.758
- Get her, Matt.
- I'll go get you another one.

14:13.862 --> 14:15.793
- Fuck you!
I hope you die.

14:15.896 --> 14:18.172
- Easy, easy. Good, but...

14:18.275 --> 14:19.413
Ruin her day, not her life.

14:19.517 --> 14:21.655
Good, though. Good stuff.

14:24.724 --> 14:26.206
- So I've just been
going to parties lately

14:26.310 --> 14:27.724
and stealing things.
- I think that's smart.

14:27.827 --> 14:30.896
- Thanks.
- So... This is me.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.448
- Well, I--I would
invite myself in,

14:32.551 --> 14:34.482
but I never mix
sex and networking.

14:34.586 --> 14:35.724
- Probably for the best.

14:35.827 --> 14:38.103
Having sex with me is like
having sex on ecstasy.

14:38.206 --> 14:39.275
You'll be depressed
for six months afterwards.

14:43.517 --> 14:44.448
- I really gotta thank
you guys.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.034
Without you,
I never would have had

14:46.137 --> 14:47.689
the confidence to stand up
for myself.

14:47.793 --> 14:49.172
- You should
thank yourself, Matt.

14:49.275 --> 14:50.827
You're the one
who made that waitress cry.

14:50.931 --> 14:52.275
- Well, thanks, me.

14:52.379 --> 14:54.896
Man, I feel like
a whole new person.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.379
- You know, that's great, Matt.

14:56.482 --> 14:59.827
But right behind this door
is the final test.

15:11.068 --> 15:13.275
- Whoa, wait. I'm sorry.
What's going on?

15:13.379 --> 15:14.793
I thought you two
were married.

15:14.896 --> 15:16.620
- Well, exactly.
We're a team.

15:16.724 --> 15:19.137
- I'm gonna watch.

15:21.551 --> 15:25.689
- Oh! Oh...

15:27.068 --> 15:30.034
- I'm so happy
we're doing this, finally.

15:30.137 --> 15:30.896
- You're doing great.
- Thank you.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.724
You're doing so well.

15:33.827 --> 15:36.275
Oh! Yes.

15:36.379 --> 15:38.103
- I was a virgin
until we had sex.

15:38.206 --> 15:39.172
- Oh my God.
- Yeah.

15:39.275 --> 15:40.862
I hated it.
I'm never gonna do it again.

15:40.965 --> 15:42.137
- So you're in love
with me now?

15:44.275 --> 15:48.034
- Uh, Matt? Could you give us
a minute or go away forever?

15:49.310 --> 15:50.758
- Do whatever
you're gonna do.

15:50.862 --> 15:53.482
Nothing can shock me
anymore.

15:55.827 --> 15:58.448
I'm confident now.

15:58.551 --> 16:02.206
- Well, we fucked.
- Yes! Yes, we did.

16:02.310 --> 16:03.827
It was a pleasure
sleeping with you.

16:03.931 --> 16:05.413
- You as well.
- Mm.

16:05.517 --> 16:07.655
Nice,
firm handshake, there.

16:07.758 --> 16:08.620
- Yeah.
- Never noticed

16:08.724 --> 16:10.068
quite how firm
your handshake was.

16:10.172 --> 16:12.586
- It's firm.

16:12.689 --> 16:14.310
Shall we, uh...
- Yeah, let's go do some--

16:14.413 --> 16:15.517
- Get those emails?
- Yep, got to check up

16:15.620 --> 16:16.758
on my email, so...

16:16.862 --> 16:17.862
- So you were
used as a sex toy

16:17.965 --> 16:18.862
by a couple of cult leaders.

16:18.965 --> 16:20.448
Some people would pay
for that.

16:20.551 --> 16:23.137
- I'm a human dildo.
- Sure, but,

16:23.241 --> 16:24.896
someday you'll connect
with someone.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.931
Or maybe you won't.
Some people never do.

16:27.034 --> 16:28.379
I just don't wanna see

16:28.482 --> 16:30.068
Jeff and Gretchen
at the closing ceremony.

16:30.172 --> 16:31.793
It's gonna be so awkward.

16:31.896 --> 16:33.689
- I'm actually really looking
forward to the closing ceremony.

16:33.793 --> 16:34.862
Natasha's gonna be there.

16:34.965 --> 16:36.413
I have this weird, warm feeling

16:36.517 --> 16:37.344
where I actually
wanna see her again.

16:37.448 --> 16:40.551
- Isn't that Natasha
over there?

16:40.655 --> 16:42.655
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry.

16:45.931 --> 16:47.103
- He's got a great butt.

16:47.206 --> 16:48.793
- Your eyes are
beautiful with this--

16:48.896 --> 16:50.172
- Hey, what is this?

16:50.275 --> 16:51.689
- Hey, Jake Levinson.

16:51.793 --> 16:53.793
Excuse me, I'll be right back

16:53.896 --> 16:55.758
to sort out
all these crazy cards.

16:55.862 --> 16:58.068
Jake, why are you acting
like some jealous boyfriend

16:58.172 --> 16:59.172
all of a sudden?

16:59.275 --> 17:00.482
- Well, because...

17:00.586 --> 17:03.103
Didn't yesterday mean
anything to you?

17:03.206 --> 17:06.172
- Oh. Hey, Jake, I'm sorry.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.896
It was just networking.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.206
- Yeah... Yeah, me too.

17:12.310 --> 17:13.827
Don't worry about it.

17:13.931 --> 17:16.551
Yeah, I'm just gonna
go give my cat a quick call.

17:18.172 --> 17:19.241
- Ah, damn it.

17:19.344 --> 17:23.000
Oh, you're the waitress
from last night.

17:23.103 --> 17:24.827
- I'm not a waitress anymore.

17:24.931 --> 17:26.172
After you yelled at me,

17:26.275 --> 17:29.000
the resort demoted me
to janitorial.

17:29.103 --> 17:32.172
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
I-I never yell like that.

17:32.275 --> 17:33.379
Here, let me help you.

17:33.482 --> 17:37.172
- No! Just, please...

17:37.275 --> 17:38.482
Leave me alone.

17:38.586 --> 17:40.517
Some executive
puked on the pool deck,

17:40.620 --> 17:44.448
and I gotta go mop it up
before it dries.

17:44.551 --> 17:46.413
- My wife and I fuck
animals and men.

17:46.517 --> 17:47.827
- Yeah...
- Hey, I need to

17:47.931 --> 17:49.413
talk to you two.
- Ooh!

17:49.517 --> 17:50.379
- Oh, hey!
- Matt, how are you?

17:50.482 --> 17:52.241
- Hey, buddy boy.
- Touching you.

17:52.344 --> 17:53.344
- Look at these little nips--
- Stop!

17:53.448 --> 17:54.551
- Whoa!
- Stop touching me.

17:54.655 --> 17:55.827
- Okay, okay.
- You know that waitress

17:55.931 --> 17:57.586
got demoted because of us?

17:57.689 --> 17:58.586
- What, do you feel guilty?
Don't feel guilty.

17:58.689 --> 18:00.655
- No, no, no. Guilt?

18:00.758 --> 18:02.724
Guilt is just insecurity
leaving the body.

18:02.827 --> 18:04.724
- Besides, we're the ones who
planted the hair in your food,

18:04.827 --> 18:06.655
so you shouldn't
feel guilty about anything.

18:06.758 --> 18:07.965
- What?

18:09.241 --> 18:11.172
- Oh! We gotta go,
that's our cue.

18:11.275 --> 18:14.689
This was great.
- Yeah, it was.

18:18.758 --> 18:19.517
- All right,
team Hampton DeVille,

18:19.620 --> 18:21.103
give it up for yourselves!

18:21.206 --> 18:23.206
Yeah! We learned a lot
this weekend.

18:23.310 --> 18:24.172
Learned a lot about teamwork,

18:24.275 --> 18:26.275
learned a lot
about management,

18:26.379 --> 18:28.344
and we learned a lot
about each other.

18:28.448 --> 18:30.103
Ted? Your secret's safe
with us.

18:30.206 --> 18:31.172
- Whoopsie!

18:31.275 --> 18:35.034
Now, step forward
if you are ready

18:35.137 --> 18:38.965
to be baptized
and reborn an AHOLE!

18:39.068 --> 18:41.758
- Yeah! Come up here, AHOLE.
- Look at this AHOLE.

18:41.862 --> 18:44.068
- Come on up here,
you fucking nerd.

18:51.103 --> 18:52.896
All right, hold your breath.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.896
all:  AHOLE, AHOLE.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.862
- All right!
- Yeah.

18:57.965 --> 19:00.655
- Whoo! I love this company!

19:00.758 --> 19:04.310
- All right, who's next?
Get up here, lady!

19:04.413 --> 19:05.379
Here we go!

19:05.482 --> 19:08.689
all:  AHOLE, AHOLE!

19:12.206 --> 19:16.137
- Oh, yeah, come on, big boy.

19:16.241 --> 19:18.241
all:  AHOLE, AHOLE!

19:18.344 --> 19:21.758
- Yeah!
Look at this wet hamster.

19:21.862 --> 19:24.517
Come on up here.

19:24.620 --> 19:26.551
- Fucking whatever,
just do it.

19:26.655 --> 19:28.241
- We will!

19:32.068 --> 19:34.724
All right, see ya later,
sad guy.

19:34.827 --> 19:37.310
What a miserable AHOLE.
Oh, Matt's coming up here.

19:37.413 --> 19:42.310
All right, Matt.
Come on, let us baptize you.

19:42.413 --> 19:44.827
- You know what?
I'm not gonna do this.

19:44.931 --> 19:46.344
- Yay! My turn!

19:46.448 --> 19:49.137
- Shut up, Ted!
Don't you guys see?

19:49.241 --> 19:52.172
Jeff and Gretchen
are full of shit.

19:52.275 --> 19:54.655
This whole AHOLE program
is full of shit.

19:54.758 --> 19:58.551
Also, this isn't a baptism.
This is waterboarding.

19:58.655 --> 20:00.379
- Uh, great share, Matt.
That was really--

20:00.482 --> 20:03.034
- It's not a fucking share.

20:03.137 --> 20:07.793
- Okay.
Everyone, look at Matt.

20:07.896 --> 20:12.551
On the first day, he was
half giraffe, half dog shit.

20:12.655 --> 20:17.068
And now look at him.
He is a total AHOLE.

20:17.172 --> 20:18.172
- Congratulations, Matt.

20:18.275 --> 20:20.448
- Fuck this.
I'm going to the pool.

20:20.551 --> 20:23.103
- You're welcome, Matt.
- Come on, Teddy, let's do it!

20:23.206 --> 20:25.068
All right, Ted's weird.
He likes it.

20:25.172 --> 20:26.448
He wants it too much.

20:40.137 --> 20:41.448
- Oh, come on.

20:41.551 --> 20:44.413
- God, really? I'm not
falling for this again.

20:44.517 --> 20:48.034
-  Did you
arrange for another...

20:48.137 --> 20:50.827
- No, did you?

20:50.931 --> 20:53.517
- No.
- No?

20:53.620 --> 20:57.241
- Everyone stay calm!

20:58.620 --> 20:59.448
- ♪ Clear blue skies

20:59.551 --> 21:01.965
♪ The sun is shining

21:02.068 --> 21:03.172
♪ Birds fly high...

21:03.275 --> 21:05.068
- Jesus, what do they do to you
on that retreat?

21:05.172 --> 21:07.965
- ♪ Never gonna die

21:10.862 --> 21:12.413
- Oh! Mmm...

21:12.517 --> 21:14.068
I'm sorry.
What--what was that?

21:14.172 --> 21:15.241
- Oh.
- Oh.

21:15.344 --> 21:17.241
That--that's what
I was gonna say too.

21:17.344 --> 21:19.586
Oh. Ohh...

21:19.689 --> 21:21.482
- That's great. Yeah.
- Okay.

21:21.586 --> 21:22.551
Any critici--
- No.

21:22.655 --> 21:23.758
- Okay.
- None right now.

21:23.862 --> 21:24.689
- Okay, great.
