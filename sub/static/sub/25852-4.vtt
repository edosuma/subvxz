01:01.100 --> 01:03.880
<i>The kidnapping of Hwang Ji Wook
this afternoon</i>

01:03.880 --> 01:06.690
<i>has been resolved thanks to
the efforts of the Golden Time Team.</i>

01:06.690 --> 01:08.630
<i>Seeing this case,
the National Police Agency</i>

01:08.630 --> 01:13.390
<i>believes the new Golden Time Team,
placed in Poongsan to expand its powers</i>

01:13.390 --> 01:16.360
<i>to be a success.</i>

01:17.800 --> 01:19.440
Good job.

01:19.440 --> 01:26.770
The reporters are so happy with you,
all calling in and asking for interviews.

01:31.330 --> 01:37.470
I realized today how essential
the Golden Time Team is.

01:38.400 --> 01:44.080
Which is why I wanted to tell you to take
Yang Choon Byung and use him for a month.

01:45.210 --> 01:49.580
- Detective Yang Choon Byung?
- Yeah, he's a veteran detective.

01:49.580 --> 01:51.830
It'll be good to have him for a month.

01:51.830 --> 01:55.500
Without him, your team won't be able to
get to the scene in three minutes.

01:55.500 --> 02:00.800
They don't know Poongsan well.
I'll take that as a yes, okay?

02:00.800 --> 02:03.290
Sure. I'll get going then...

02:03.290 --> 02:05.390
Right, Director Kang!

02:05.390 --> 02:10.949
I heard Captain Do skipped work and
gave you trouble from the very first day.

02:10.949 --> 02:14.760
If he gives you any problem,
come report to me right away!

02:14.760 --> 02:18.460
We've got a ton of men
who can replace him at our station!

02:19.720 --> 02:22.190
Thank you for your concerns...

02:22.190 --> 02:27.090
but he was the one who convinced
Mr. Hwang Ki Hyuk today.

02:27.090 --> 02:29.250
Then.

02:34.380 --> 02:36.310
What the heck...

02:44.290 --> 02:47.420
<i>Even if he deserves
to be ripped to pieces...</i>

02:47.420 --> 02:50.800
<i>Even if Hee Joo asked you
to kill him for her...</i>

02:50.800 --> 02:54.390
<i>If you are Hee Joo's father...
If you truly love her...</i>

02:55.260 --> 02:57.000
You need to stop right here.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.650
<i>Yeah, good job, Ji Wook.</i>

03:00.650 --> 03:06.100
<i>I want to see Dad and Hee Joo.</i>

03:06.100 --> 03:10.970
Okay, I'll take you home.

03:12.500 --> 03:17.120
Detective Koo called saying Captain Do
just taught Yum Gi Tae a lesson.

03:17.120 --> 03:19.900
I don't think he's as bad as the rumors.

03:29.970 --> 03:32.890
Yes, Captain Do. Thank you for today.

03:32.890 --> 03:35.900
- Where are--
- I'm at Kwak Min Soo's motel room.

03:38.030 --> 03:40.020
I think he's the culprit.

03:40.020 --> 03:43.350
What? Are you sure?

03:43.350 --> 03:49.030
There are pictures of corpses.
And there's the mask he wore, too.

03:49.030 --> 03:51.540
Everything is here.

03:51.540 --> 03:54.860
<i>Kwak Min Soo was trying to
smuggle himself out on a ship</i>

03:54.860 --> 03:58.070
- and got caught by coast guards.
- Hold on, I have a message.

03:58.070 --> 03:59.190
What did you say?

03:59.190 --> 04:01.090
<i>He's detained at
the Poongsan coast guard station.</i>

04:01.090 --> 04:04.260
<i>- The inspector general went there, too.</i>
- Okay.

04:04.260 --> 04:07.770
Kwak Min Soo's been arrested by the coast
guards for trying to smuggle himself out.

04:07.770 --> 04:10.690
The inspector general is going there.
What should we do?

04:10.690 --> 04:14.190
Damn bastard, I heard
he disappeared at the port...

04:14.190 --> 04:16.190
- See you at the coast guard station.
- Okay.

04:18.500 --> 04:20.290
Stay here.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.290
I guess they caught him.

04:26.520 --> 04:30.920
- Go find out who she's meeting.
- Sure.

04:36.820 --> 04:40.680
Agent Park, I'm on my way to
the coast guard station with Captain Do.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.840
Please take care
of the call center while I'm gone.

04:51.290 --> 04:52.970
<i>[Poongsan Coast Guard Station]</i>
Just five minutes.

04:52.970 --> 04:55.140
<i>You know you can't meet
the suspect before an investigation.</i>

04:55.140 --> 04:56.700
Fine, don't worry.

04:56.700 --> 05:00.110
But I noticed that he seems
to be a little out of it.

05:00.110 --> 05:02.370
I don't know if you'll
be able to talk to him.

05:02.370 --> 05:05.840
Perfect, that's exactly
the man I'm looking for.

05:05.840 --> 05:09.670
Keep your promise. Just five minutes.

05:17.680 --> 05:20.510
Seriously, this is insane...

05:24.540 --> 05:29.470
Somebody online paid me
to make that for him, so I did.

05:29.470 --> 05:32.190
Then why did you try to run?

05:32.190 --> 05:36.040
There's evidence all over your motel room
that you're the culprit.

05:36.040 --> 05:40.580
I have no idea, I met someone
on "Racing Toto" through a chat.

05:40.580 --> 05:44.030
He said he would pay me to create
an auto-acceleration device...

05:52.290 --> 05:55.040
Who the heck is this?

05:56.250 --> 05:58.030
<i>Hi.</i>

05:58.030 --> 06:00.610
Who the heck are you?
You want to fight?

06:00.610 --> 06:02.570
<i>Can you create
an auto-acceleration device?</i>

06:02.570 --> 06:05.610
<i>I saw your engine analysis
was pretty good.</i>

06:05.610 --> 06:08.970
<i>I'll give you 10 million up front,
and another 20 million at the end, okay?</i>

06:08.970 --> 06:12.290
<i>He said he wanted to commit insurance
fraud, and if I made the device for him</i>

06:12.290 --> 06:14.260
<i>he would pay me 30 million won.</i>

06:14.260 --> 06:15.970
<i>Think about it.</i>

06:15.970 --> 06:17.660
<i>[Hercules has left the chat room.]</i>

06:19.020 --> 06:25.060
<i>Loan sharks were after me saying they
would pluck my eyes out, I had no choice.</i>

06:33.590 --> 06:36.910
<i>[Good job.]
I knew it was too good to be true.</i>

06:36.910 --> 06:39.270
Damn that Hercules...

06:41.100 --> 06:44.820
<i>He's not lying.
He really feels wronged.</i>

06:44.820 --> 06:49.240
You said you video chatted with him.
Did you get to see his face, then?

06:49.240 --> 06:52.550
We were on an illegal gambling site,
why would we show our faces?

06:52.610 --> 06:53.980
He was wearing a mask.

06:53.980 --> 06:57.170
Did you see a tattoo
on the back of his hand then?

06:57.170 --> 06:58.490
A tattoo?

06:58.490 --> 07:02.070
No, there was nothing.
It was very clean.

07:06.010 --> 07:07.570
Let's talk.

07:18.930 --> 07:22.670
From his voice,
it's likely he's telling the truth.

07:22.670 --> 07:26.640
Perhaps he's fallen into a trap
set by the real culprit.

07:26.640 --> 07:30.260
Kwak Min Soo's just another accomplice
like Jang Soo Bok?

07:30.260 --> 07:32.000
What a rat...

07:32.000 --> 07:35.660
He figured we were after him,
and used Kwak Min Soo.

07:35.660 --> 07:40.840
One good thing is that he may not know
that Kwak Min Soo's been caught.

07:40.840 --> 07:42.040
Detective!

07:42.040 --> 07:46.750
- The inspector general is here.
- What do we do now?

07:46.750 --> 07:50.270
If the real culprit is Hercules,
we need to get him.

07:50.270 --> 07:52.980
We need Kwak Min Soo's testimony.

07:58.410 --> 08:00.150
What the heck...

08:00.150 --> 08:06.020
Then that jerk Hercules
was trying to frame me from the start?

08:06.170 --> 08:08.770
This is insane.

08:09.460 --> 08:13.800
What if I become a suspect
in the murder case?

08:16.520 --> 08:18.660
I need to get him
if I want to get out.

08:18.660 --> 08:21.040
<i>Did he have a tattoo
on the back of his hand?</i>

08:21.040 --> 08:24.540
<i>I'll give you 10 million up front,
and 20 million more at the end, okay?</i>

08:24.540 --> 08:28.630
Yeah, I don't know about a tattoo,
but he had a pet spider.

08:28.630 --> 08:30.980
Yeah, I remember.

08:30.980 --> 08:33.960
I remember. I do...

08:37.210 --> 08:39.580
Who are you?

08:53.300 --> 08:55.400
Pardon me.

08:57.440 --> 09:00.500
This is a pesticide.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.870
Your heart will stop beating soon.

09:09.690 --> 09:15.250
So you're saying Officer Kwak Min Soo
is a suspect in a murder case?

09:15.250 --> 09:18.060
You said he was trying to escape
because of a gambling debt.

09:18.060 --> 09:21.580
This is the first
I'm hearing of this, too.

09:21.580 --> 09:23.970
You know about the Mount Gang Oh case
from a few days ago?

09:23.970 --> 09:28.590
We're tracking down the culprit, and we
had a few suspicions about Officer Kwak.

09:28.590 --> 09:32.680
- We just have a few more questions.
- That case has already been closed.

09:32.680 --> 09:35.270
I didn't hear anything
about a reinvestigation.

09:35.270 --> 09:38.600
You have clearance from your superior?

09:38.600 --> 09:41.580
I just heard someone
moaning and struggling.

09:41.580 --> 09:44.800
And also the snapping
of latex gloves.

09:45.460 --> 09:48.600
- What?
- Gambling when you're a cop...

09:48.600 --> 09:53.650
You're worse than mosquitoes.
What is wrong with you cops...

09:53.990 --> 09:56.770
<i>- What's going on?
- Who's in there?</i>

09:57.780 --> 10:01.060
- You're sure someone else is in there?
- I'm sure.

10:03.430 --> 10:06.160
He just opened the window, hurry!

10:06.160 --> 10:09.100
- What are you doing?
- Open the door, hurry!

10:09.100 --> 10:10.860
Yes...

10:13.400 --> 10:16.730
- Hey...
- Are you okay?

10:16.730 --> 10:22.110
- Min Soo!
- Call the ambulance now!

10:23.020 --> 10:27.600
- Oh, no...
- We have an emergency in the...

10:28.480 --> 10:31.480
Answer us!

10:32.060 --> 10:34.130
Over here, he left through here.

10:34.130 --> 10:35.780
Bastard.

10:40.760 --> 10:43.470
- Captain.
- Min Soo!

10:43.470 --> 10:46.090
Come on!

10:46.090 --> 10:47.940
Damn it!

10:52.960 --> 10:54.770
This is insane.

10:54.770 --> 10:57.010
Come on, Min Soo.

10:57.010 --> 11:01.010
<i>[Episode 4: Shhh... It's a Secret]</i>

11:01.010 --> 11:04.520
<i>[I think people that have a brother or
sister don't realize how lucky they are.]</i>

11:04.520 --> 11:08.420
<i>[Sure, they fight a lot, but to know
that there's always somebody there...]</i>

11:08.420 --> 11:10.710
<i>[Somebody that's family.
-Trey Parker]</i>

11:10.710 --> 11:12.100
<i>[8:35 p.m.]</i>

11:12.100 --> 11:16.010
<i>[Kwak Min Soo, the suspect for
Jang Kyung Hak's murder, is killed]</i>

11:16.010 --> 11:20.000
Why wasn't I told he had a panic disorder
that could lead to cardiac arrest?

11:20.000 --> 11:24.150
I didn't want to make
a big deal out of it, I'm sorry.

11:24.150 --> 11:28.670
Who knew it would lead to cardiac arrest?
He was so healthy...

11:28.670 --> 11:31.770
Are you kidding me?
What's wrong with you?

11:31.770 --> 11:35.460
- Any possibility he was murdered?
- None.

11:35.460 --> 11:38.080
Other than loan sharks,
he had no enemies.

11:38.080 --> 11:42.050
Those guys aren't crazy enough
to come in here.

11:42.050 --> 11:45.880
Don't be so sure.
If the reporters make an issue of this

11:45.880 --> 11:49.300
our superiors will be
dealing with a huge mess.

11:49.300 --> 11:53.690
Keep it quiet until
we get orders from headquarters.

11:59.560 --> 12:02.540
You think the culprit was
waiting inside the building?

12:04.710 --> 12:06.700
When Kwak Min Soo's guard was down

12:06.700 --> 12:10.040
he probably injected him
with drugs to cause cardiac arrest.

12:10.040 --> 12:13.810
Just as in the Gang Oh case,
he's used to injecting drugs.

12:13.810 --> 12:17.380
He thought he would be able to
frame everything on Kwak Min Soo

12:17.380 --> 12:19.560
but when he got arrested,
he decided to kill him.

12:19.560 --> 12:23.940
And when we got to him first,
he waited for the right time.

12:23.940 --> 12:25.720
I'll check every CCTV inside.

12:25.720 --> 12:27.700
No.

12:27.700 --> 12:31.190
As you can see, he escaped only by
going through areas without cameras.

12:31.190 --> 12:32.950
He even had a coast guard uniform.

12:32.950 --> 12:36.390
- Meticulous, just like three years ago.
- Let's talk.

12:36.390 --> 12:41.250
What have you two done?
Did you coerce Kwak Min Soo?

12:41.250 --> 12:45.090
Never, but why are you eliminating
the possibility of a murder?

12:45.090 --> 12:49.490
- Someone could have invaded--
- If you're curious what we did with him

12:49.490 --> 12:52.620
then find out yourself.
Isn't that your job as an inspector?

12:52.620 --> 12:55.250
We're busy, we need to go.

12:55.250 --> 12:56.760
Let's go.

12:58.300 --> 13:01.290
What, do you want to
request a reinvestigation?

13:01.290 --> 13:06.030
It'll take a month just to gather
evidence, we have no time to waste.

13:06.690 --> 13:09.170
Dok Ki, it's a trap.
Get out of there.

13:09.170 --> 13:11.240
- Don't leave anything behind.
- What?

13:11.240 --> 13:12.780
Okay.

13:14.830 --> 13:19.450
Damn it, I laid everything out,
now I can't leave anything behind?

13:19.450 --> 13:21.540
Why won't this go in?

13:21.540 --> 13:23.250
Damn.

13:25.600 --> 13:29.480
Kwak Min Soo died of a heart attack.

13:29.480 --> 13:31.600
It's likely it was
the real culprit's doing.

13:31.600 --> 13:35.190
Have Agent Jin find out about
Hercules on the website, "Racing Toto."

13:35.190 --> 13:38.370
Call if he needs a warrant.
I'll call again.

13:39.600 --> 13:42.540
I'm sure they haven't
done the autopsy yet.

13:42.540 --> 13:45.570
Still, I'm sure they'll have something.

13:50.710 --> 13:54.540
She says Kwak Min Soo was
murdered by the real culprit.

13:54.540 --> 13:55.910
What? Murdered?

13:55.910 --> 13:58.750
Inside the coast guard building?
He's no joke.

13:58.750 --> 14:01.470
I feel like this is getting more serious.

14:02.830 --> 14:07.550
Find out about a member named Hercules
from this website, she says it's urgent.

14:07.550 --> 14:08.830
Okay.

14:08.830 --> 14:14.240
Don't you think we should be
getting training on firearms use?

14:14.240 --> 14:17.970
- What are you saying?
- Well, that culprit...

14:17.970 --> 14:22.430
He seems like a real psycho,
what if he starts targeting us?

14:23.340 --> 14:27.950
I'm just saying,
maybe we should be prepared...

14:45.520 --> 14:48.600
How dare they get in my way.

14:48.600 --> 14:50.200
<i>Kwak Min Soo!</i>

14:50.200 --> 14:51.970
<i>Are you sure someone else is inside?</i>

14:51.970 --> 14:54.120
<i>I'm sure.</i>

14:55.630 --> 14:58.190
He just opened the window, hurry!

15:12.840 --> 15:18.240
Does she have the ability
to hear things others can't hear?

15:20.730 --> 15:22.740
I doubt that...

16:03.990 --> 16:06.800
Chief, the NFS just called.

16:06.800 --> 16:10.450
The DNA test will take a while.
The hands are missing, too.

16:10.450 --> 16:13.720
If you look here, you can see
cigarette burns on the arm.

16:13.720 --> 16:16.410
But this is not enough
to identify the victim.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.970
So, you'll just wait around?

16:23.970 --> 16:28.190
You said a witness saw that
he had one artificial eye.

16:28.190 --> 16:31.150
If you must, search all
of Poongsan to find him.

16:31.150 --> 16:33.950
Don't even think about crawling
back before you find him.

16:35.040 --> 16:36.830
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes.

16:38.700 --> 16:42.600
Come on, watch where you're going.

16:45.490 --> 16:48.720
Chief, we have the cause
of Kwak Min Soo's death.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.330
It was a heart attack.

16:50.330 --> 16:51.760
A heart attack?

16:51.760 --> 16:56.760
Yes, Captain Do and Director Kang took
Kwak Min Soo in and talked to him.

16:56.760 --> 16:59.340
That must have
had a big impact.

17:01.200 --> 17:07.450
- You found out what they talked about?
- It was a conference room for inspectors

17:07.450 --> 17:10.200
and there were no cameras.

17:11.150 --> 17:15.190
The two of them have gone
to the police hospital.

17:15.190 --> 17:19.069
Go there right now, and find
out what they're talking about.

17:19.069 --> 17:20.550
Yes, Sir.

17:26.280 --> 17:33.240
Do Kang Woo, why is it that
people around you always end up dying?

17:49.690 --> 17:52.560
Why did they have to
come at that time?

18:01.800 --> 18:04.530
<i>I don't need to worry, right?</i>

18:04.530 --> 18:06.150
<i>No evidence left behind, right?</i>

18:07.090 --> 18:09.130
<i>You don't trust me?</i>

18:10.580 --> 18:13.770
<i>It's not that,
I just wanted to make sure.</i>

18:14.430 --> 18:19.160
<i>First, Doctor Fabre members meet for the
purpose of getting rid of human insects.</i>

18:19.160 --> 18:24.810
<i>Second, Doctor Fabre members
are chosen by the administrator.</i>

18:24.810 --> 18:26.180
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

18:26.180 --> 18:29.800
<i>Find out what you can about
Kang Kwon Joo of the Golden Time Team.</i>

18:29.800 --> 18:33.450
<i>And I'm planning to cut off one member
as an example to the others.</i>

18:33.450 --> 18:35.420
<i>As an example?</i>

18:35.420 --> 18:40.440
<i>Oh, how about that one
that kept annoying us?</i>

18:40.440 --> 18:42.030
<i>Not bad.</i>

18:42.030 --> 18:44.390
<i>Let me know when you need the drugs.</i>

18:44.390 --> 18:49.200
<i>There's nothing more exhilarating
than watching an insect get killed.</i>

19:09.690 --> 19:12.250
I freed the one caught in a spider web.

19:12.250 --> 19:15.930
But he's trying
to crawl back in my mouth.

19:15.930 --> 19:19.270
Captain Do Kang Woo.

19:20.350 --> 19:23.870
I know your past that
you don't want to remember.

19:23.870 --> 19:26.010
You can't escape.

19:28.160 --> 19:30.880
I'll make it really painful for you now.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.850
Just wait.

19:42.100 --> 19:45.180
We'll have to do a full autopsy
to find out more

19:45.180 --> 19:47.850
but blood tests show that
it was a sudden heart attack.

19:47.850 --> 19:52.250
We found both high levels of creatine
and concentrated caffeine in his blood.

19:52.250 --> 19:56.320
Seeing that he had both protein powder
and caffeine tablets on his possession

19:56.320 --> 19:59.890
there's a high chance
he was taking both habitually.

19:59.890 --> 20:03.410
After taking the creatine powder
and the caffeine tablet

20:03.410 --> 20:07.910
he was caught for smuggling, and I
believe that led to his heart failure.

20:09.020 --> 20:14.630
These days it's so easy to get your hands
on drugs, so this happens quite often.

20:15.620 --> 20:17.520
What about the wounds?

20:17.520 --> 20:21.520
This may seem like a wound from a fight

20:21.520 --> 20:26.170
but this type of scar often appears
on victims of sudden heart attacks.

20:26.170 --> 20:29.100
Besides this, he also has
a scar on his forehead.

20:29.100 --> 20:32.270
Any possibility the heart attack
was caused by an injection?

20:32.270 --> 20:35.410
It's possible someone could have injected
him with caffeine near his heart.

20:35.410 --> 20:40.920
Is there no possibility this scar is
from trying to hide the injection site?

20:40.920 --> 20:43.030
Well...

20:43.030 --> 20:45.140
Theoretically, it is possible

20:45.140 --> 20:50.740
but he was already taking meds for his
heart, so we need to consider everything.

20:50.740 --> 20:53.760
It's necessary for us
to do a full autopsy.

21:00.150 --> 21:01.420
<i>Captain Do Kang Woo.</i>

21:01.420 --> 21:03.360
<i>Do you know how to hunt bears?</i>

21:03.360 --> 21:06.400
<i>You put honey-covered rock
between the trees as bait.</i>

21:06.400 --> 21:09.550
<i>Then the bear who wants to eat
the honey will smash the rock.</i>

21:09.550 --> 21:14.090
<i>The blood-covered bear will fall to the
ground, and you just wring off the neck.</i>

21:14.090 --> 21:17.630
<i>Do Kang Woo, you are that dumb bear.</i>

21:17.630 --> 21:19.590
<i>I'll send you a present.</i>

21:19.590 --> 21:21.600
Bastard.

21:21.600 --> 21:23.330
He's in my house right now.

21:25.090 --> 21:27.160
Captain Do!

21:27.160 --> 21:29.790
Captain Do, hold on.

21:29.790 --> 21:32.460
Please calm down,
and explain the situation.

21:32.460 --> 21:34.750
What do you mean he's at your house?

21:34.750 --> 21:38.810
He sent me a threatening message
with a picture of my house.

21:38.810 --> 21:41.360
If he wants to meet me,
I'll gladly meet him.

21:41.360 --> 21:43.420
You can't go alone.

21:43.420 --> 21:46.600
We'll go together.
I'll ask the police for assistance.

21:48.060 --> 21:49.890
I'll drive.

21:59.890 --> 22:02.350
The police will arrive soon,
we should wait...

22:02.350 --> 22:04.890
How can you say that seeing
how quickly he escaped?

22:04.890 --> 22:07.310
What if it's a trap?

22:07.310 --> 22:09.550
He may be waiting for you inside.

22:10.190 --> 22:14.020
You don't think I thought of that?

23:28.800 --> 23:30.460
Bastard.

23:30.460 --> 23:32.800
He was probably bluffing,
knowing we're after him.

23:32.800 --> 23:35.830
It's not the usual pattern for
a masked killer to expose himself.

23:35.830 --> 23:39.880
No, he's irritated enough
to act out of pattern.

23:39.880 --> 23:42.200
I'm sure he left something behind.

23:45.600 --> 23:48.530
Do you remember he said
he left a present for me?

24:03.220 --> 24:06.200
<i>[Your fingers]</i>

24:09.200 --> 24:12.470
<i>Come on, you don't believe me?</i>

24:12.470 --> 24:16.170
Eun Ji, I'm a cop.

24:16.170 --> 24:20.220
Yeah, I'm the genius
of the Golden Time Team.

24:22.460 --> 24:25.970
Nothing gets done without me.

24:25.970 --> 24:27.600
Yeah.

24:28.260 --> 24:29.530
Yeah.

24:29.750 --> 24:31.770
Don't worry too much.

24:31.770 --> 24:32.790
Okay.

24:34.230 --> 24:39.690
A month is a long time,
but please be patient.

24:39.690 --> 24:41.140
Okay.

24:41.140 --> 24:42.790
Don't worry.

24:42.790 --> 24:44.020
Okay.

24:44.020 --> 24:46.270
Good night.

24:50.630 --> 24:52.080
What's this?

24:52.740 --> 24:54.950
I know I turned this off.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.020
What's going on?

25:11.500 --> 25:13.540
<i>[You are next.]</i>

25:14.030 --> 25:15.790
<i>[Your fingers]</i>

25:19.980 --> 25:22.880
Director Kang, I was just
about to call you.

25:22.880 --> 25:25.290
- He's playing a prank...
- Get out right now.

25:25.290 --> 25:26.440
What?

25:26.440 --> 25:29.580
He may be targeting you,
your house may be rigged.

25:29.580 --> 25:31.140
What?

25:38.000 --> 25:41.100
<i>[Terror attempt on
Agent Jin Seo Yool]</i>

25:41.100 --> 25:43.890
- Agent Jin, Agent Jin!
- What happened?

25:44.410 --> 25:47.630
I think something happened to him.
He's at the Poongsan Studio nearby.

25:49.990 --> 25:53.340
Agent Park, I think the culprit
exploded Agent Jin's computer.

25:56.400 --> 26:00.700
How dare that lunatic terrorize
the home of a Golden Time Team agent?

26:02.440 --> 26:04.350
I just went to check the cameras.

26:04.350 --> 26:08.460
Unfortunately, they were having a
maintenance check, so nothing was filmed.

26:09.700 --> 26:12.730
You saw sliced fingers
on the screen before?

26:12.730 --> 26:16.060
Yes, the monitor
was filled with sliced fingers...

26:16.060 --> 26:18.670
then I heard people screaming.

26:18.670 --> 26:21.170
And when I tried to turn it off,
it exploded.

26:21.260 --> 26:25.330
I'm the next target, right?

26:27.830 --> 26:30.540
I've asked the police to patrol the area,
so don't worry too much.

26:30.540 --> 26:33.990
- Check up on each other often.
- Sure.

26:33.990 --> 26:36.100
Oh, I forgot...

26:39.770 --> 26:42.080
That lunatic left this behind.

26:43.500 --> 26:46.310
This seems like the level two basement
of the Poongsan Police Station.

26:46.310 --> 26:48.480
Who is this?

26:48.480 --> 26:51.100
Do you think it's the culprit?

26:59.000 --> 27:00.840
We'll find out when we look into it.

27:07.840 --> 27:09.210
Hold on.

27:10.690 --> 27:12.840
I'm glad it wasn't any worse.

27:12.840 --> 27:17.480
Yeah, I feel so safe
with all of you here.

27:17.480 --> 27:20.840
The Golden Time Team
has the best teamwork.

27:25.390 --> 27:29.910
Captain Do, what a day it's been.
Starting with Hee Joo's case...

27:29.910 --> 27:33.240
Do you realize now how dangerous
of a decision you've made?

27:33.240 --> 27:37.500
I understand well that
the culprit has a lot of hatred.

27:37.500 --> 27:42.570
But I can't understand
why he's doing all this.

27:42.570 --> 27:44.160
It's so evil.

27:44.160 --> 27:48.020
He's full of anger and hatred
towards the world.

27:48.020 --> 27:54.300
What's important is that
he's targeting your team.

27:54.300 --> 27:58.600
How about if we forget everything else,
and focus on catching that bastard?

27:59.540 --> 28:05.080
That's not possible, there are still
a lot of people who need our help.

28:05.080 --> 28:08.730
You saw before how important our work is.

28:10.150 --> 28:14.020
I don't understand why you
make things difficult for yourself.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.590
Saving lives and preventing crimes
within the golden time?

28:18.590 --> 28:22.140
You think those criminals will change
if you risk your life and fight?

28:22.790 --> 28:24.970
It's better to just
kill them on the spot.

28:26.100 --> 28:29.000
- Captain Do.
- What?

28:29.000 --> 28:31.990
I bet that's how you feel inside, too.

28:34.150 --> 28:40.090
I'm sure you think of your super hearing
as a curse in some ways.

28:40.090 --> 28:44.810
I'm sure you've had to hear
the true intentions of rotten criminals.

28:48.240 --> 28:49.870
No.

28:51.820 --> 28:55.740
I never once thought
of my talent as a curse.

28:57.970 --> 29:00.200
Yes, there are times it's difficult.

29:01.210 --> 29:05.780
But I'm grateful that I can hear sounds
that others can't hear, especially now.

29:08.050 --> 29:14.470
I'm proud of my work and
the ability to save people's lives.

29:16.720 --> 29:18.440
Go figure...

29:18.440 --> 29:20.890
To each their own.

29:22.280 --> 29:27.860
But don't believe that all police
feel the same way you do.

29:28.860 --> 29:31.650
Cops are human, too.

29:31.650 --> 29:38.030
Some do it for the money, some do it
to look cool in cop uniforms...

29:38.030 --> 29:45.300
And still, others become cops
to figure out who they really are.

30:02.260 --> 30:04.200
That lunatic...

30:04.200 --> 30:08.070
If I ever get my hands on him...
How dare he do that to a cop...

30:08.070 --> 30:09.660
Seriously...

30:11.480 --> 30:16.390
I think it's true that Captain Do was
an ace on the Poongsan police force.

30:16.390 --> 30:18.190
With Yum Gi Tae, too...

30:18.190 --> 30:21.320
The way he figures out
the minds of criminals...

30:21.320 --> 30:24.530
- I get totally shocked.
- You like him?

30:24.530 --> 30:27.940
- I'm not saying that I like him.
- I don't know.

30:27.940 --> 30:30.570
It seems like he's so full of himself.

30:30.570 --> 30:34.820
Kyung Hak and Jin Hyuk
were superb cops and leaders.

30:34.820 --> 30:38.340
He's got nothing on them.

30:39.850 --> 30:41.540
What now?

30:42.270 --> 30:44.270
It's me.

30:44.270 --> 30:46.850
I'm working, of course.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.130
That again? I told you to stop.

30:51.130 --> 30:53.310
We're done with that.

30:53.310 --> 30:57.480
Honey, this is about our future.

30:57.480 --> 31:01.400
We'll lose our chance to other people.

31:01.400 --> 31:07.290
Madame Baek runs a huge business and she
gives her time and money to charity, too.

31:07.290 --> 31:14.060
The builder has to presell a few lots.
If we buy it now, we'll get a big profit.

31:14.060 --> 31:16.240
She's doing me a favor.

31:16.240 --> 31:21.030
Excuse me, what money
do we have to buy an office?

31:21.030 --> 31:22.800
We won't be buying it alone.

31:22.800 --> 31:25.960
We'll buy it jointly,
and share the rental income.

31:25.960 --> 31:29.030
In a few years, the price will go up.

31:30.060 --> 31:33.550
With your salary, how will we ever
send So Min to an elite school?

31:33.550 --> 31:37.840
I told you to stop. Since when
did we care about elite schools?

31:37.840 --> 31:42.150
Whatever, I'm going to Poongsan
tomorrow to take a look.

31:42.150 --> 31:48.080
Director Kang liked the cucumber kimchi
I made before, I'll bring some tomorrow.

31:48.080 --> 31:52.690
Look at all this
hard work I do for you...

31:52.690 --> 31:55.880
Don't come!
You better not do anything dumb.

31:55.880 --> 31:58.830
I'll never talk to you then.
Hang up.

31:58.830 --> 32:00.310
Come on, hang up!

32:00.310 --> 32:02.580
Honey...

32:02.580 --> 32:03.730
What's going on?

32:04.780 --> 32:07.420
It's nothing.

32:07.420 --> 32:10.890
- This woman is out in her mind...
- Joong Ki.

32:10.890 --> 32:13.280
It's "out of her mind."

32:13.280 --> 32:16.210
Whatever...

32:16.210 --> 32:19.320
Seriously...

32:19.640 --> 32:22.480
He's got no guts at all.
How did he ever become a cop?

32:29.310 --> 32:32.030
Madam...

32:32.030 --> 32:34.950
<i>Yeah, Hee Jin...
What happened?</i>

32:36.070 --> 32:39.140
If your husband is against it,
then maybe next time.

32:39.140 --> 32:41.640
I've got many others
who want to jump on this chance.

32:41.640 --> 32:44.160
Others?

32:46.000 --> 32:49.370
No, my husband said it's fine.

32:49.370 --> 32:52.910
- He would be a fool to miss this chance.
- That's good, then.

32:52.910 --> 32:56.930
- Where should I meet you tomorrow?
- I'll pick you up.

32:56.930 --> 33:02.010
- We can go in my car.
- Okay, I'll see you tomorrow, then.

33:02.010 --> 33:04.510
Okay, bye.

33:13.690 --> 33:16.390
Whatever, I'll just be looking...

33:19.230 --> 33:23.100
I can't believe it's been eight years
I've been married to a cop.

33:24.230 --> 33:26.110
Wait a minute...

33:26.110 --> 33:30.680
I can't just go dressed like this.

33:33.390 --> 33:35.150
Let's see...

33:42.050 --> 33:46.200
I wore this when
I was still dating Joong Ki...

33:47.940 --> 33:49.550
I don't know if I can fit into it.

34:13.500 --> 34:16.860
Min Soo!

34:16.860 --> 34:20.600
<i>He's filled with anger and hatred
towards the world.</i>

34:20.600 --> 34:24.400
What's important is that
he's targeting your team.

34:25.840 --> 34:28.440
Who could be doing this?

34:43.500 --> 34:45.190
<i>[I heard the news, I still can't
believe Kyung Hak left like that.]</i>

34:45.190 --> 34:47.190
<i>[I'm sorry I can't be there
with you during this hard time.]</i>

34:47.190 --> 34:49.290
<i>[I'm sure you and your new partner
will catch the culprit soon.]</i>

34:51.290 --> 34:53.190
<i>[I'll go back as soon as
Dong Woo gets better.]</i>

34:53.190 --> 34:55.820
<i>[Don't forget, we're one team.
- Moo Jin Hyuk]</i>

35:18.920 --> 35:23.230
<i>But don't believe that all police
feel the same way you do.</i>

35:24.500 --> 35:26.810
Cops are human, too.

35:28.500 --> 35:34.810
Some do it for money, some do it
to look cool in cop uniforms.

35:34.810 --> 35:42.020
And still, others become cops
to figure out who they really are.

35:43.030 --> 35:45.920
<i>There was no warmth at all in his house.</i>

35:45.920 --> 35:49.270
<i>It's hard to believe
anybody lives there.</i>

36:45.750 --> 36:48.340
When you ran away yesterday
during the blackout

36:48.340 --> 36:51.600
the pruning shears disappeared
from the evidence room.

36:51.600 --> 36:55.560
I believe you took it.

37:01.980 --> 37:05.840
Bastard...

37:09.080 --> 37:10.540
Let's see...

37:20.370 --> 37:24.850
Too bad, I should have burned up
all of that critter's fingers.

37:27.360 --> 37:31.330
It's alright, it's only the beginning.

37:31.330 --> 37:33.230
Bang!

37:36.900 --> 37:39.560
Be prepared, everyone.

37:46.500 --> 37:48.350
<i>Kang Woo...</i>

37:48.350 --> 37:52.260
<i>Kang Woo, I'm here...
Kang Woo...</i>

37:53.100 --> 37:55.990
<i>Kang Woo... Kang Woo!</i>

37:55.990 --> 37:57.860
<i>Kang Woo, I'm in here!</i>

37:58.530 --> 37:59.750
<i>Kang Woo!</i>

37:59.750 --> 38:03.360
Kang Woo, please help...

38:03.360 --> 38:05.590
- Hyung Joon!
- Take me out!

38:06.200 --> 38:09.630
Kang Woo, take me out.

38:09.630 --> 38:11.540
Please...

38:11.540 --> 38:14.900
- Your hand...
- Take me out.

38:16.130 --> 38:17.490
I can't go up!

38:17.490 --> 38:19.310
Help!

38:19.310 --> 38:21.940
Please help!

38:21.940 --> 38:23.680
Do you remember who did this to you?

38:23.680 --> 38:26.110
- I'm sorry.
- No!

38:26.110 --> 38:30.940
I'll get him for you, just tell me
what he looked like, Hyung Joon!

38:32.870 --> 38:35.000
You're curious about that?

38:35.800 --> 38:37.670
It was you.

38:37.670 --> 38:39.600
Do Kang Woo.

38:39.600 --> 38:44.230
You cut off my hand and killed me.

38:44.230 --> 38:47.450
It was you!

39:00.290 --> 39:02.440
You killed me.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.790
<i>No. No!</i>

39:04.790 --> 39:05.960
No!

40:25.690 --> 40:29.490
Cut it off nice and clean.

40:46.700 --> 40:49.090
<i>Someone invaded
Agent Jin's house last night.</i>

40:49.090 --> 40:51.740
And his computer exploded.

40:51.740 --> 40:54.020
Fortunately, Agent Jin
only suffered an injury.

40:54.020 --> 40:59.600
But this was a warning that the culprit
can invade any of our homes at any time.

40:59.600 --> 41:03.470
So an alert has been issued for our team.

41:03.470 --> 41:07.460
Always move in pairs, and don't
forget to carry the baton at all times.

41:07.460 --> 41:08.950
Yes!

41:08.950 --> 41:12.450
And please welcome
Detective Yang to our team.

41:12.450 --> 41:14.120
Hi.

41:14.120 --> 41:16.840
- Should we end it here?
- Okay!

41:17.900 --> 41:21.150
Come on, don't look so glum.

41:21.150 --> 41:25.950
Too bad, there's not much
for you to do if you can't type.

41:25.950 --> 41:31.000
It's just a little burn, and I have
a lot of other talents besides this.

41:31.000 --> 41:34.260
I could have taken care of him
if I were home at the time.

41:35.300 --> 41:37.170
What a man...

41:38.900 --> 41:44.050
- Why did Captain Do miss the meeting?
- He's not in today?

41:44.050 --> 41:46.950
Of course he's here.
He came a while ago.

41:46.950 --> 41:49.090
He's sleeping.

41:49.090 --> 41:52.660
He's sleeping because
he doesn't want to be in the meeting.

41:52.660 --> 41:55.900
He must not like Captain Do.

41:55.900 --> 41:59.060
Director Kang, we need to talk.

42:00.400 --> 42:02.280
- Go ahead.
- Yes.

42:10.400 --> 42:14.260
I've explained fully well
what kind of scum Do Kang Woo is.

42:14.260 --> 42:16.710
You'll still embrace him?

42:17.670 --> 42:20.960
The fact that Captain Do
is necessary to our team

42:20.960 --> 42:24.740
was proven through
Yum Gi Tae's case yesterday.

42:25.900 --> 42:30.410
I understand this is
because of your brother...

42:30.410 --> 42:32.690
but please give us a month's time.

42:32.690 --> 42:35.010
We won't disappoint you.

42:35.010 --> 42:36.770
Then, I'll get going.

42:38.190 --> 42:40.530
You think this is
because of my own revenge?

42:41.630 --> 42:44.370
You'll know when he betrays you, too.

42:46.690 --> 42:48.640
You'll understand why I'm doing this.

42:52.560 --> 43:00.170
Just remember that I'm the one who
knows Do Kang Woo best in Poongsan.

43:11.600 --> 43:14.500
<i>If I press this, it'll be all over!</i>

43:14.500 --> 43:16.810
<i>You'll all be dead!</i>

43:17.840 --> 43:21.170
<i>Bring her! Bring her now!</i>

43:27.060 --> 43:29.560
<i>If I press this, it'll be all over!</i>

43:29.560 --> 43:31.080
<i>You'll all be dead!</i>

43:32.070 --> 43:36.730
<i>Bring her! Bring her now!</i>

43:39.550 --> 43:42.790
<i>Over there! There!</i>

43:44.240 --> 43:49.180
<i>How thorough and meticulous is his plan?</i>

43:54.230 --> 43:55.590
Yeah, go ahead.

43:55.590 --> 44:00.160
His mom came up from the countryside,
and she doesn't know anything.

44:00.160 --> 44:02.490
She's crying her eyes out.

44:02.490 --> 44:03.820
Hold on.

44:03.820 --> 44:07.860
Bring my Min Soo back!

44:07.860 --> 44:10.460
You'll faint if you keep crying.

44:11.200 --> 44:12.470
Did you hear?

44:12.470 --> 44:15.440
I don't think there's anything more
we can get from here.

44:15.440 --> 44:19.070
<i>I'm thinking of visiting
Kang Doo Won in prison.</i>

44:19.070 --> 44:21.290
But he's been losing his sanity.

44:21.290 --> 44:23.340
I don't know if
we'll get anything from him.

44:23.340 --> 44:26.100
You still want me to go?

44:26.100 --> 44:28.190
Do as I say.

44:28.190 --> 44:30.400
Okay.

44:33.910 --> 44:36.640
Why is it so dark in here?

44:36.640 --> 44:39.170
Seriously...

44:41.220 --> 44:43.210
That looks fun.

44:43.210 --> 44:46.380
You have time to play with that?

44:46.380 --> 44:49.440
It's not easy using both sides
of the brain simultaneously.

44:49.440 --> 44:54.310
It seems like you really
don't like me, Detective Park.

44:55.360 --> 44:59.290
You are mistaken.

44:59.290 --> 45:02.990
It's not that
it seems like I don't like you.

45:02.990 --> 45:06.050
I don't like you.

45:06.480 --> 45:09.380
Still, you're my superior,
I have to follow your orders.

45:09.380 --> 45:12.070
I'm used to people not liking me.

45:12.070 --> 45:16.840
But let's not stress each other.
It wasn't my choice to be here, either.

45:16.840 --> 45:21.190
There are reasons
when someone is not liked.

45:21.190 --> 45:27.480
The only people I respect as my elders
are Kyung Hak and Jin Hyuk.

45:27.480 --> 45:31.790
- It's too bad if you're disappointed.
- I'm not disappointed.

45:31.790 --> 45:36.510
I'm much younger than you.
Just look at our faces.

45:36.510 --> 45:40.180
And I don't need or want your respect.

45:40.180 --> 45:42.170
What about my face?

45:42.170 --> 45:45.880
Everybody tells me I look
young for my age, what the heck...

45:45.880 --> 45:48.260
What's the big deal?

45:48.260 --> 45:50.290
Who cares about one's appearance?

45:50.290 --> 45:53.410
Detective Koo, what year were you born?

45:53.410 --> 45:56.400
- I was born in '83.
- '83...

45:56.400 --> 45:59.460
You're the same age as me, then.

45:59.460 --> 46:02.780
<i>[12:15 p.m.
Elderly suicide case in Oksan]</i>

46:02.780 --> 46:04.870
Yes, 911 call center.

46:05.790 --> 46:10.290
Sir, can you please calm down
and explain slowly?

46:10.290 --> 46:13.290
<i>[Oksan, Poongsan]</i>

46:13.290 --> 46:14.660
Hello?

46:14.660 --> 46:20.230
My Soon Hee hung herself
and committed suicide.

46:20.230 --> 46:21.900
Suicide?

46:21.900 --> 46:26.760
Send an ambulance...
No, send me the police.

46:26.760 --> 46:29.480
Can you give me
your name and address?

46:29.480 --> 46:33.780
- The victim's name, too.
- My name is Kim Sang Goo.

46:33.780 --> 46:39.590
And I'm at 311 1st Street
in Oksan, Poongsan.

46:39.590 --> 46:42.680
The caller's name, Kim Sang Goo.
Victim's name, Won Soon Hee.

46:42.680 --> 46:47.090
311 1st Street in Oksan, Poongcheon.
Director, it's an elderly suicide case.

46:47.090 --> 46:51.380
Won Soon Hee, age 70, living in a monthly
rental home, widowed 20 years ago.

46:51.380 --> 46:54.920
She has a son named Kang Jong Seok
whose business recently went bankrupt.

46:54.920 --> 46:58.500
- He has very bad credit.
- This is Director Kang Kwon Joo.

46:58.500 --> 47:00.880
- Are you Mr. Kim Sang Goo?
- Yes.

47:00.880 --> 47:04.360
And Ms. Won Soon Hee is
the one who attempted suicide?

47:04.360 --> 47:07.700
What's your relation to her?
Are you sure she is dead?

47:07.700 --> 47:09.560
Yeah.

47:09.560 --> 47:14.780
It's her 70th birthday today,
so I came to visit her with a cake.

47:14.780 --> 47:20.060
And I found her hanged.

47:20.060 --> 47:24.610
<i>She was a cancer patient.</i>

47:24.610 --> 47:30.270
<i>Recently, she's been saying often
that she wants to just die.</i>

47:30.270 --> 47:36.870
But I had no idea she would
end her own life like this...

47:36.870 --> 47:40.730
Sir, please calm down
and try to explain more in detail.

47:44.220 --> 47:45.780
So...

47:45.780 --> 47:51.190
<i>Let's not be sad or depressed
on a happy day like today.</i>

47:51.190 --> 47:57.330
<i>Let's go away on vacation this year,
and enjoy our time together.</i>

47:57.330 --> 48:00.980
<i>Happy birthday, Soon Hee.</i>

48:02.860 --> 48:05.150
Soon Hee.

48:05.150 --> 48:06.650
It's me.

48:09.630 --> 48:16.080
<i>As soon as I walked in,
I could smell blood.</i>

48:17.080 --> 48:19.830
<i>And I saw that the dog was dead.</i>

48:19.830 --> 48:23.660
<i>And the fish tank
was shattered on the floor.</i>

48:23.660 --> 48:25.800
What happened here?

48:30.370 --> 48:34.430
<i>She's not breathing.
I think she's dead.</i>

48:34.430 --> 48:37.420
She really was diagnosed
with stomach cancer.

48:37.420 --> 48:39.810
Call the medical team
and tell the police it's suicide.

48:39.810 --> 48:41.280
Yes, Ma'am.

48:42.290 --> 48:43.920
<i>Something's not right.</i>

48:43.920 --> 48:47.320
<i>Even if she committed suicide
because of her illness</i>

48:47.320 --> 48:51.100
<i>she wouldn't have killed her pets.</i>

48:51.100 --> 48:55.860
You promised you would be
strong and hang in there.

49:01.430 --> 49:03.650
Soon Hee, you're alive?

49:03.650 --> 49:06.020
You're alive? Breathe.

49:07.590 --> 49:10.530
Excuse me, Officer, she's alive!

49:10.530 --> 49:12.800
Pardon? What did you say?

49:12.800 --> 49:14.290
Soon Hee...

49:14.290 --> 49:17.490
She breathed for a moment,
but she stopped again.

49:17.490 --> 49:21.070
Can you put the cell phone
by her nose and mouth?

49:28.850 --> 49:31.240
<i>The airways are open again
after removing the rope</i>

49:31.240 --> 49:33.380
<i>but she's still not breathing fully.</i>

49:33.380 --> 49:36.530
I think she's suffering from
prolonged asphyxia.

49:36.530 --> 49:39.160
Tilt her head backwards
to open up the airway.

49:39.160 --> 49:40.780
Okay.

49:46.760 --> 49:49.860
<i>We'll start the CPR.
Lay her on her back.</i>

49:49.860 --> 49:54.720
Continue to press down on the center of
her chest until the medical team arrives.

49:54.720 --> 49:55.930
Where's the ambulance?

49:55.930 --> 50:00.520
There's an accident at the intersection
of Oksan Market, another 10 minutes.

50:00.520 --> 50:04.100
<i>It'll be hard for a man in his 70s
to give her medical care alone.</i>

50:04.100 --> 50:07.460
<i>And there's something else
that's off about the scene.</i>

50:07.460 --> 50:10.850
- Is her residence near a police station?
Yes, five minutes away.

50:12.510 --> 50:16.540
This is a code one situation, the caller
is a 72-year-old man, Kim Sang Goo.

50:16.540 --> 50:18.490
<i>Address, 311 1st Street in Oksan.</i>

50:23.890 --> 50:27.970
Ms. Won Soon Hee is semi-unconscious
after a suicide attempt...

50:27.970 --> 50:29.480
<i>[Pretty Wife]</i>

50:29.480 --> 50:31.720
I'm busy right now.

50:31.720 --> 50:33.800
Honey...

50:36.510 --> 50:39.320
Eight minutes until an ambulance arrives.

50:39.320 --> 50:43.620
If we lose too much time, the brain may
get damaged, so please move quickly.

50:43.620 --> 50:44.920
Let's go!

50:47.590 --> 50:50.980
- Your wife will get mad.
- What can I do?

50:50.980 --> 50:52.980
We've got no time, let's go!

52:09.210 --> 52:12.310
How dare you mess things up!

52:41.850 --> 52:44.650
The police will be there soon.
Please hang in there.

52:44.650 --> 52:48.050
I can't anymore...

52:51.130 --> 52:54.340
You are the only one
who can save Ms. Won Soon Hee.

52:56.860 --> 52:59.370
Captain Do, please hurry.

53:00.690 --> 53:02.870
Mr. Kim Sang Goo!

53:02.870 --> 53:04.990
We're the dispatch team.

53:04.990 --> 53:07.030
Please move over.

53:16.900 --> 53:19.330
Ma'am, are you okay?

53:20.550 --> 53:23.120
<i>Her breathing is stabilizing.</i>

53:23.120 --> 53:25.470
That way, please.

53:27.580 --> 53:29.730
One, two, three...

53:34.760 --> 53:40.200
- Please take him.
- She's made it through the crisis.

53:45.740 --> 53:48.860
You're good with CPR, too.

53:48.860 --> 53:52.220
It's nothing.
I'm good at a ton of things.

53:54.970 --> 53:59.310
Who did this to the dog?
Why would anyone do this?

54:14.500 --> 54:17.990
Why are all the frozen items
in the refrigerator?

54:43.100 --> 54:45.330
<i>This wasn't suicide.</i>

54:45.330 --> 54:48.420
<i>An invader tried to kill her,
and covered it up as a suicide.</i>

54:48.420 --> 54:53.770
<i>A man much bigger than her,
and someone rough and violent.</i>

54:55.100 --> 54:56.630
Director Kang.

54:56.630 --> 55:00.080
This may be an attempted murder
disguised as a suicide.

55:00.080 --> 55:01.250
Attempted murder?

55:01.250 --> 55:05.870
The electrical cord used to hang her was
tied army-style in a figure-eight knot.

55:05.870 --> 55:10.150
And she wouldn't have
hung the cord to a broken doorknob.

55:10.150 --> 55:12.180
It doesn't make sense.

55:13.960 --> 55:15.970
Find out who came to the house
before the caller.

55:15.970 --> 55:19.970
<i>- And find an alibi for the caller, too.</i>
- Agent Jin, check all the CCTVs.

55:19.970 --> 55:24.150
- Agent Park, see if she had any enemies.
- Sure.

55:25.370 --> 55:27.830
Director Kang,
there aren't any CCTVs by the house.

55:27.830 --> 55:31.090
There are some installed
nearby to prevent crimes

55:31.090 --> 55:33.610
but they're controlled by the ward
office, so I'll reach out to them.

55:33.610 --> 55:38.230
So you're saying this wasn't a suicide,
but an attempted murder?

55:38.230 --> 55:40.260
The doorknob was broken.

55:40.260 --> 55:45.020
Someone strangled her and tied
the cord to the knob and hurried out.

55:45.700 --> 55:48.630
And no 70-year-old woman
could make a knot like that.

55:49.520 --> 55:51.560
Start searching the area.

55:51.560 --> 55:53.000
- Okay.
- Sure.

55:56.450 --> 56:01.810
<i>But why did he move the food
from the freezer into the refrigerator?</i>

56:02.440 --> 56:04.290
<i>What are you saying?</i>

56:04.290 --> 56:09.360
<i>Soon Hee's not the type
to be hated by others.</i>

56:09.360 --> 56:14.490
<i>She was like an angel who
gave more than she received.</i>

56:14.490 --> 56:18.320
You said that was the first time
you went to her house today, right?

56:18.320 --> 56:23.490
What? Are you suspecting me?

56:23.850 --> 56:27.250
<i>Since it's Soon Hee's birthday</i>

56:27.250 --> 56:31.900
I went to the bathhouse as well as
the barber shop, you can check.

56:31.900 --> 56:33.610
Sure.

56:34.690 --> 56:37.790
Director Kang, I just spoke
with someone at the welfare center.

56:37.790 --> 56:40.980
They said nobody would
have a grudge against her.

56:40.980 --> 56:45.300
Just a few days ago, she gave homemade
kimchi to one of the volunteers.

56:46.690 --> 56:48.930
Director Kang, you should see this.

56:48.930 --> 56:53.180
Records show her insurance recently paid
out 50 million won for her treatment.

56:53.180 --> 56:56.200
But seeing as there were
no bank transactions since then

56:56.200 --> 56:58.780
she must have kept the money at home.

56:58.780 --> 57:00.140
Captain Do.

57:00.140 --> 57:04.730
<i>There's a chance Ms. Won kept 50 million
won of medical insurance money at home.</i>

57:04.730 --> 57:08.540
I think you're right, it must be an
attempted murder disguised as suicide.

57:22.390 --> 57:23.940
Director Kang.

57:23.940 --> 57:26.510
I have Ms. Won Soon Hee's phone log.

57:26.510 --> 57:29.440
She spoke to someone from
a suspicious number for about 20 minutes.

57:29.440 --> 57:32.670
This seems to be
a typical voice phishing pattern.

57:32.670 --> 57:34.510
Voice phishing?

57:34.510 --> 57:37.130
We found a witness.

57:37.130 --> 57:39.440
Where are you?

57:39.440 --> 57:41.020
I'm at the store in front of her house.

57:41.020 --> 57:43.380
The store owner's mother
says she witnessed something.

57:43.380 --> 57:45.050
Okay, I'll be right there.

57:47.340 --> 57:53.350
Yeah, I saw a young woman
come out of Soon Hee's house.

57:53.980 --> 57:57.500
<i>She was wearing a red dress,
and running away quickly.</i>

57:57.500 --> 57:59.990
You rotten bitch!

58:03.830 --> 58:05.890
Do you remember their faces?

58:05.890 --> 58:07.500
Yeah, I remember.

58:07.500 --> 58:10.900
The woman had a pretty face.

58:10.900 --> 58:16.420
She looked like a mother in her 30s.

58:16.420 --> 58:20.560
A man came running out after her.

58:20.560 --> 58:22.000
He looked very corrupt.

58:22.000 --> 58:25.180
He looked like a criminal.

58:25.960 --> 58:31.280
In one eye, he had a fake eyeball.

58:31.280 --> 58:35.630
And he spoke in a North Korean dialect.

58:38.720 --> 58:40.530
We have the specifics on the suspects.

58:40.530 --> 58:43.200
The woman was in her mid to late 30s,
wearing a red dress.

58:43.200 --> 58:47.320
The man was in his 30s with a fake eye,
probably a Korean-Chinese.

58:47.320 --> 58:50.020
As voice phishing crimes
have gotten more common

58:50.020 --> 58:53.780
there are cases where the middleman
runs off with the victim's money

58:53.780 --> 58:56.590
so I heard sometimes
a separate surveillant is hired.

58:56.740 --> 58:59.760
Director Kang, you should see this.

59:03.350 --> 59:05.500
Aren't these the suspects?

59:05.500 --> 59:07.490
- I think so.
- Zoom in.

59:08.080 --> 59:10.580
This man really has an artificial eye.

59:12.420 --> 59:14.060
Found him.

59:14.060 --> 59:16.120
Name, Geum Tak Wi. Age 37.

59:16.120 --> 59:18.090
He's Korean, but from Yanbian, China.

59:18.090 --> 59:20.900
He was a big guy in a gang, but
was caught and sentenced to death

59:20.900 --> 59:25.350
so he smuggled himself here, and he's
been scouted by a voice phishing gang.

59:27.110 --> 59:31.770
This is the center, we're presuming this
to be a voice phishing case.

59:31.770 --> 59:35.020
The male suspect is believed to
be a Korean-Chinese surveillant.

59:35.020 --> 59:38.780
<i>He's an illegal immigrant
who ran to Korea to escape his country.</i>

59:38.780 --> 59:40.790
Please go to 300 1st Street in Oksan

59:40.790 --> 59:45.740
- to see what the woman dropped there.
- Okay, we'll move there.

59:45.740 --> 59:47.610
This way, let's go.

59:52.690 --> 59:53.690
<i>[12:40 p.m.]</i>

59:53.690 --> 59:56.100
<i>[Danger level raised from
a suicide case to attempted murder]</i>

59:56.100 --> 59:59.410
<i>Okay...</i>

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:03.500
It's Unit 304 again, right?

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:07.390
Even if I talk to them,
they always do this.

01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:11.320
No consideration for others...

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:15.770
How can they be so selfish?

01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:20.980
Officer, you should scold them.

01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:25.800
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:00:28.610 --> 01:00:31.470
Those are all of your mother's favorites.

01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:34.310
How is your mother's health? Better?

01:00:34.310 --> 01:00:36.810
What was it again, Meniere's disease?

01:00:36.810 --> 01:00:40.800
I heard everything spins around you
even if you're sitting down.

01:00:42.790 --> 01:00:46.750
Yes, we switched her meds,
and it's gotten a bit better.

01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:59.830
Mom, I'm home.

01:00:59.830 --> 01:01:01.790
You've been waiting, right?

01:01:01.790 --> 01:01:04.110
I'll go get changed
and get the food ready.

01:01:16.170 --> 01:01:22.330
Mom, didn't the people in Unit 304
illegally park their cars before, too?

01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:29.320
I just saw on my way up that they
parked in the wrong place again.

01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:33.230
Even if people say things,
they don't change.

01:01:36.510 --> 01:01:38.200
Let's see.

01:01:49.110 --> 01:01:52.030
Is that broken again?

01:01:52.030 --> 01:01:54.760
Mom, that song...

01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:58.940
Old piece of junk...

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:04.950
It's really time to get a new one.

01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:11.060
I told you I would get you a new one,
why are you being so stubborn?

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:13.330
Come on, Mom...

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.310
Let's see.

01:02:25.590 --> 01:02:27.130
Seriously...

01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:29.620
See? It's really broken.

01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:32.910
I'll buy you a new one tomorrow.

01:02:32.910 --> 01:02:34.780
Don't be too upset, Mom.

01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:47.530
Please don't hurt me... Please...

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:56.570
You can't even do as ordered,
and you're trying to run away?

01:02:58.010 --> 01:03:00.710
It's that hard to take
the money out of the freezer?

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:05.110
Madam Baek just asked me to
get something from her aunt's house.

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:12.770
I won't tell anyone, please let me go.

01:03:12.770 --> 01:03:16.340
Let you go? You mean home?

01:03:17.370 --> 01:03:22.190
Too bad, you saw my face already.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.500
Director Kang.

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:29.230
Doesn't she look just like
Detective Park's wife?

01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:42.820
Why are you doing this?

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:45.160
What are you doing?

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.580
<i>Captain Do.</i>

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:58.600
<i>The female suspect looks just like
Detective Park's wife, Ms. Ahn Hee Jin.</i>

01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:08.050
Oh, I'm getting busy at work,
I will need to hurry.

01:04:09.090 --> 01:04:13.060
When this is over,
let's go see the ocean together.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:18.520
You can wait for me, right, Mom?

01:04:23.690 --> 01:04:27.100
