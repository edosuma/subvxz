WEBVTT

00:25.093 --> 00:28.062
Excuse me,
sir. Sir.

00:28.096 --> 00:30.231
Can you step over here, please?

00:30.264 --> 00:31.865
Problem?

00:31.899 --> 00:34.902
No problem. Random
additional screening.

00:34.935 --> 00:36.904
Uh, this necessary?
My flight was two hours late,

00:36.937 --> 00:38.239
my buddy's
been waiting.
Just take a moment.

00:38.272 --> 00:39.373
Right this way.

00:39.407 --> 00:41.542
I understand you're
doing your job,

00:41.575 --> 00:45.913
but maybe you can,
uh, cut me a break?

00:48.749 --> 00:49.883
Thank you for your service.

00:49.917 --> 00:52.853
No, thank you.

00:59.093 --> 01:00.161
Passenger down.

01:00.194 --> 01:02.530
Need an EMT in Customs now.

01:04.598 --> 01:07.235
Sir. Can you
hear me, sir?

01:07.268 --> 01:09.903
WOMAN:
He's not breathing.
Got no pulse.

01:09.937 --> 01:11.972
Start CPR.
EMT's on the way.

01:12.005 --> 01:14.542
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:14.575 --> 01:17.178
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:17.211 --> 01:19.680
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:19.713 --> 01:20.981
* How, how, how, how

01:21.014 --> 01:23.351
* Hey, hey

01:29.190 --> 01:30.558
* You gotta come on.

01:32.059 --> 01:35.196
All right, let me get
this straight. Okay?

01:35.229 --> 01:37.931
I drive you to the
airport, I carry your kit,

01:37.965 --> 01:39.600
but I don't get
to work the body?

01:39.633 --> 01:41.269
It seems like I'm more
chauffeur than intern.

01:41.302 --> 01:43.604
If it's your calling,
a little grunt work won't

01:43.637 --> 01:45.005
seem like an imposition.
Calling?

01:45.038 --> 01:46.507
More like a little
pocket money.

01:46.540 --> 01:49.710
Ooh, the lady doth
protest too much, methinks.

01:49.743 --> 01:52.246
What lady?

01:52.280 --> 01:55.048
Shakespeare.
Hamlet.

01:55.082 --> 01:57.185
Never heard of either of 'em.
Oh...

01:57.218 --> 01:59.119
Look, I would protest
a little less

01:59.153 --> 02:00.788
if you let me
near that body.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.523
Patience is a virtue.

02:02.556 --> 02:04.425
Now, be a doll
and go grab me a...

02:04.458 --> 02:06.194
Coffee, sugar, cream.

02:06.227 --> 02:08.229
Thank you.

02:09.463 --> 02:12.032
Our victim-- Navy Petty Officer

02:12.065 --> 02:15.636
First Class Felix Armstrong--

02:15.669 --> 02:17.037
was making his way
through customs

02:17.070 --> 02:18.672
when he suddenly collapsed.

02:18.706 --> 02:21.775
Found this in his jacket.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.877
Dalteparin?
It's an anticoagulant.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.546
It's used to prevent
blood clots.

02:25.579 --> 02:27.114
Also note the bluish

02:27.147 --> 02:28.749
discolorations of the nail bed.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.320
Suggests cyanosis--

02:32.353 --> 02:35.022
lack of oxygen in the blood.

02:35.055 --> 02:38.125
Often caused
by cardiopulmonary arrest.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.793
So, heart attack.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.195
Possibly.

02:41.229 --> 02:43.797
But cyanosis also occurs
in drug overdoses.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.799
No way to tell
for sure until I get...

02:45.833 --> 02:47.067
Get him on the table?
Yeah.

02:47.100 --> 02:49.837
Let me get you a T-shirt made
with that written on the front.

02:51.572 --> 02:53.374
Once I run the tox screen,

02:53.407 --> 02:55.776
I'll let you know
what we're looking at.

02:57.077 --> 02:59.880
What do you got?
Got the flight records.

02:59.913 --> 03:02.250
Armstrong took a chartered
plane from Havana.

03:02.283 --> 03:04.485
Must've been stationed at Gitmo.

03:04.518 --> 03:05.986
But he took a chartered flight?

03:06.019 --> 03:07.955
What's off
is log at Belle Chasse

03:07.988 --> 03:09.457
said they got
a Gitmo flight landing

03:09.490 --> 03:10.758
in a couple of hours.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.426
Why pay for a chartered flight
when there's

03:12.460 --> 03:14.595
free transport
same day?
I'll try to find out

03:14.628 --> 03:16.264
why Armstrong was on the flight.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.098
See if he talked
to anyone on the plane.

03:18.131 --> 03:20.834
I'll talk to
airport police.
Go.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.203
Excellent,

03:23.237 --> 03:26.173
right at the base
of the skull.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.809
Yup, uh, forcing the chest to,

03:28.842 --> 03:30.678
uh... um...

03:30.711 --> 03:32.280
You know, the...

03:32.313 --> 03:36.684
Expand for maximum access
to the thoracic cavity.

03:36.717 --> 03:39.152
Yeah, that.
Someone wants

03:39.186 --> 03:42.523
to get near a body, someone
needs to do their homework.

03:42.556 --> 03:45.326
And yet someone got to go
to the crime scene today.

03:45.359 --> 03:48.028
Jealousy ain't a good look, bro.
Me?

03:48.061 --> 03:50.898
Jealous? Why would I be jealous
after working here for, like,

03:50.931 --> 03:53.200
five years and only getting
to go to the crime scene from

03:53.233 --> 03:54.368
time to time.

03:54.402 --> 03:55.903
Danny merely drove me.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.372
I have a license. I can drive.

03:58.406 --> 04:01.309
Says the dude who's afraid
to make left turns.

04:01.342 --> 04:02.943
You told him that?

04:02.976 --> 04:05.913
Today, the crime scene,
tomorrow your job, Big Bird.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.381
Okay, well,

04:07.415 --> 04:09.082
first of all, I consider myself
more of a Beaker

04:09.116 --> 04:10.584
than a Big Bird.
Second of all,

04:10.618 --> 04:12.720
53.7% of all
accidents

04:12.753 --> 04:14.922
involve left-hand turns,
so forgive me

04:14.955 --> 04:16.089
for putting safety first.

04:16.123 --> 04:17.925
Simmer down, Beaker,

04:17.958 --> 04:20.628
there's plenty of work
for both my boys.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.832
May I help you?

04:28.436 --> 04:30.170
That Felix Armstrong?

04:30.203 --> 04:31.772
And you would be?

04:31.805 --> 04:34.442
A friend.

04:34.475 --> 04:35.809
I'm sorry

04:35.843 --> 04:37.244
for your loss,

04:37.277 --> 04:39.513
but you can't be in here.

04:39.547 --> 04:41.749
Oh, no, no, no,
see, it's cool.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.016
I got this.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.518
Now, it's a letter
from the family

04:44.552 --> 04:45.853
giving me permission
to take the body.

04:45.886 --> 04:48.956
I have yet
to conduct the autopsy.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.424
And even once complete,

04:50.458 --> 04:53.527
I can only release him
to next of kin.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.364
Sir,

04:56.397 --> 04:57.865
you have to leave.

04:59.800 --> 05:00.934
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.370
Whoa, whoa.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.037
All right.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.840
Now, the only way
I'm leaving here...

05:06.874 --> 05:08.876
is with that body.

05:23.424 --> 05:26.494
I talked to the Navy,
got the bio on our vic.

05:26.527 --> 05:29.096
Petty Officer First
Class Felix Armstrong.

05:29.129 --> 05:32.400
34 years and stationed at
Gitmo for the last three.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.201
Tours in Iraq,
Afghanistan,

05:34.234 --> 05:37.070
numerous commendations.
Red flags in his personal life?

05:37.104 --> 05:40.173
I ran the cat's
financials, dumped

05:40.207 --> 05:42.275
his phone.
Found two things:

05:42.309 --> 05:43.944
jack and squat.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.379
This dude
is Mr. Clean-clean.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.180
Any idea what he was doing
in New Orleans?

05:47.214 --> 05:49.282
Armstrong's out of Chi-town.
No obvious

05:49.316 --> 05:50.784
connections
to the city.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.920
Family knew nothing
at all about the trip.

05:52.953 --> 05:55.122
Other passengers on his flight

05:55.155 --> 05:57.124
said he kept to himself.

05:57.157 --> 05:58.358
You hear from Loretta?

05:58.392 --> 05:59.760
Called.
No answer.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.829
She's probably
knee-deep in autopsy.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.296
So, Navy man comes in

06:03.330 --> 06:04.798
on a non-military
flight

06:04.832 --> 06:06.434
to a city where
he has no business.

06:06.467 --> 06:07.968
Yeah, no ties
at all.

06:08.001 --> 06:09.537
Make that one tie.
Spoke to the airport policeman.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.104
Said he was approached

06:11.138 --> 06:13.173
by a friend of Armstrong's.
His name's

06:13.206 --> 06:15.375
Philip Culliver. He was there
to pick Armstrong up.

06:15.409 --> 06:18.145
Went to contact the victim's
family, never came back.

06:18.178 --> 06:20.714
Okay. Follow up with the friend.

06:20.748 --> 06:23.651
Meantime, I'll contact
Armstrong's commanding officer,

06:23.684 --> 06:25.385
see if he can tell me
why Armstrong

06:25.419 --> 06:27.855
was in town.
And hey, give it 15 minutes

06:27.888 --> 06:29.457
and try Loretta again.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.559
Want to find out
what's going on with that body.

06:31.592 --> 06:34.294
Everyone, put your phones
on the table.

06:34.327 --> 06:35.829
Do it now.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.367
And you-- Slim.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.502
You close all
those blinds

06:41.535 --> 06:43.170
and lock
those doors.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.705
You-- help him.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.043
And you--

06:50.077 --> 06:51.344
get that body in a bag.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.115
Come on,
move, move, move.

06:56.784 --> 06:58.686
Come on,
come on, come on.

07:01.489 --> 07:04.291
Hey! What the hell
you doing, huh?

07:04.324 --> 07:06.494
I'm-I'm just scratching.
I-I get hives in high-pressure

07:06.527 --> 07:08.161
situations-- when it's fight
or flight, my brain

07:08.195 --> 07:09.897
takes over, my body
starts to malfunction.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.932
You should've seen me before
prom, it was a disaster.

07:11.965 --> 07:14.434
Shut it.
Shutting.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.337
You.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.474
Quit mad dogging me, boy.

07:20.508 --> 07:21.775
I'm not your boy.
Okay,

07:21.809 --> 07:23.977
now everybody take it easy.

07:24.011 --> 07:26.179
It's not the first time
I had a gun in my face.

07:26.213 --> 07:27.915
It could be your last.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.684
No, no, no.
Look, please, just listen to me.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.854
No one's gonna have
a last anything.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.656
We are not
trying to stop you.

07:37.357 --> 07:39.459
All right.

07:39.493 --> 07:42.262
You put that body in a bag, put
him on a gurney, and I can go.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.964
Okay, well, it's a little more
complicated than that.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.666
I've got to file a C.O.D.
and a Form 15...

07:45.699 --> 07:47.668
Don't stall me.

07:47.701 --> 07:50.203
I'm not stalling,
I am just trying to help.

07:50.237 --> 07:52.506
If you walk outside
without the proper paperwork,

07:52.540 --> 07:54.174
the armed guards

07:54.207 --> 07:55.709
at the exit
are gonna ask

07:55.743 --> 07:57.778
questions,
and none of us

07:57.811 --> 08:00.213
want those questions
answered with gunfire.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.216
Write up my paperwork.

08:04.084 --> 08:06.386
Go on. Do it now.

08:06.419 --> 08:08.956
PRIDE:
Armstrong was
unauthorized absence?

08:08.989 --> 08:11.224
Yes, sir.
Went missing yesterday.

08:11.258 --> 08:14.394
Any idea why he'd be on a
chartered flight to New Orleans?

08:14.427 --> 08:17.097
Asking ourselves
the same damn question.

08:17.130 --> 08:19.266
Petty Officer Armstrong
was a squared-away sailor.

08:19.299 --> 08:20.768
Loyal to a fault.

08:20.801 --> 08:23.537
What was Armstrong
working on at Gitmo?

08:23.571 --> 08:25.539
Latest assignment
was a task force

08:25.573 --> 08:28.108
taking down the Padilla Group.
Terrorist organization

08:28.141 --> 08:29.610
operating out of Cuba.

08:29.643 --> 08:32.379
Drug running, guns,
human trafficking.

08:32.412 --> 08:34.748
You got a cause of death
there down there?

08:34.782 --> 08:37.084
Yeah, we're still waiting.
But soon as we know anything,

08:37.117 --> 08:39.219
you're our first call.

08:39.252 --> 08:41.054
So his C.O. has no idea

08:41.088 --> 08:43.256
why he went U.A.?

08:43.290 --> 08:44.792
I just don't think we're
getting the whole story.

08:44.825 --> 08:47.561
Something's funky.
With the friend, too.

08:47.595 --> 08:49.797
No one in the city
by the name Philip Culliver.

08:49.830 --> 08:52.099
And the phone number he gave
airport police doesn't exist.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.934
Well, Patton's trying
to catch our mystery man

08:53.967 --> 08:56.870
on airport
security cams.

08:59.106 --> 09:02.175
I'm digging the new digs,
Triple P.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.744
This an office or trophy room?

09:03.777 --> 09:05.545
Batting champ,
first-team

09:05.579 --> 09:07.414
all state,
North Gwinnett High School.

09:07.447 --> 09:08.882
I was fast, too.
I had wheels

09:08.916 --> 09:10.851
before I had wheels.
Hey, All State,

09:10.884 --> 09:12.219
you got anything for us?

09:12.252 --> 09:15.355
Yeah. This is Armstrong's
mysterious

09:15.388 --> 09:17.858
airport pickup gone missing.
Bruce any help?

09:17.891 --> 09:19.593
Still working.

09:19.627 --> 09:22.062
All right.
Well, keep us posted.

09:22.095 --> 09:23.764
All right.
How about Loretta?

09:23.797 --> 09:25.999
I called again.
Nothing.

09:26.033 --> 09:29.002
Patch her in on the plasma.

09:29.036 --> 09:32.439
You know, that's the third time
they've called.

09:32.472 --> 09:35.575
If I don't pick up, they'll
know something's going on.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.546
Fine.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.182
You two. Over here.

09:42.215 --> 09:43.550
Come on,
move it.

09:43.583 --> 09:44.818
Now. Move!

09:48.956 --> 09:51.725
Hey.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.694
Now, you say anything
to tip them off--

09:53.727 --> 09:55.528
anything at all--
and you got

09:55.562 --> 09:57.898
two more autopsies you're gonna
have to do. You understand me?

09:57.931 --> 09:59.767
Mm-hmm.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.769
All right, go.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.712
Hello, Dwayne.

10:11.745 --> 10:14.214
Not taking my calls.
Something I said, Loretta?

10:14.247 --> 10:16.116
Busy morning, that's all.

10:16.149 --> 10:19.286
Just following up
on Armstrong.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.088
Of course.

10:21.121 --> 10:24.224
After further examination
of the petty officer,

10:24.257 --> 10:26.727
my initial suspicions
are correct.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.495
Cardiac arrest?

10:28.528 --> 10:30.563
From Larrabee Syndrome.

10:30.597 --> 10:34.134
A fatal spasm
of the coronary artery.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.103
Investigation's open and shut
as far as I can tell.

10:36.136 --> 10:39.472
Easy day for everyone
concerned, then.

10:39.506 --> 10:42.743
Even planning a long lunch.

10:42.776 --> 10:45.779
Contact Jefferson Parish
SWAT and EMTs.

10:45.813 --> 10:47.414
We're headed to the morgue now.

10:47.447 --> 10:48.849
Never heard
of Larrabee Syndrome.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.583
'Cause it's not a syndrome.

10:50.617 --> 10:52.119
Captain Adam Larrabee.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.154
Case we worked on
before your time.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.189
He died in a hostage standoff.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.734
Give this
to the guard at the door.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.401
Body's all yours.

11:08.435 --> 11:11.038
You're coming with.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.006
Collateral if anything
goes down.

11:13.040 --> 11:16.009
You help me get this body to
my van... and I'll let you go.

11:16.043 --> 11:18.611
Now, wait a minute, there's no
need to take her, all right?
Waiting time's over.

11:18.645 --> 11:21.181
You hear me?
Now, you two.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.783
One the ground, face down.

11:22.816 --> 11:25.052
Count to 1,000.
Hell I will.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.854
Danny, just do as he says.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.926
All right, come on.

11:36.329 --> 11:38.531
Move it.

11:38.565 --> 11:41.769
Smooth and easy.

11:44.471 --> 11:47.574
GUARD:
He's going crazy. I was like,
"Man, I'm out of here."

11:47.607 --> 11:48.876
DOCTOR:
Yeah, fear for your life.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.477
GUARD:
I know, exactly.
Mm-hmm.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.880
Morning, Dr. Wade.
I'll see you later.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.547
You done with
autopsy already?

11:54.581 --> 11:56.649
What can I say?
Open and shut.

11:56.683 --> 11:59.286
Uh-huh.
Who's this?

11:59.319 --> 12:01.554
His family.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.858
You sure
everything's all right?

12:04.892 --> 12:06.760
Oh, fine, Darrel.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.169
Back off, rent-a-cop.
Hey...

12:17.504 --> 12:19.572
Hey.
We're walking out of here.

12:19.606 --> 12:20.841
You hear me?

12:20.874 --> 12:22.175
All right,
easy, guy.

12:22.209 --> 12:23.977
Just relax, now.

12:24.011 --> 12:26.246
Just... Hey.
Oh! Oh.

12:27.747 --> 12:31.351
Come on, back to the
room now! Move, move!

12:36.023 --> 12:37.925
Anyone comes in here,

12:37.958 --> 12:39.893
and everybody dies!

12:47.300 --> 12:50.070
Danny.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.941
Danny.

13:15.228 --> 13:16.696
PRIDE:
Darrel, what happened?

13:16.729 --> 13:18.198
The guy in there with a gun,

13:18.231 --> 13:20.800
he clipped me.
We got him.
Go, guys, go.

13:20.834 --> 13:23.436
He took hostages.
They're in Autopsy.

13:23.470 --> 13:24.872
Doc Wade
and who else?

13:24.905 --> 13:27.640
Oh... Sebastian.
And the kid.

13:27.674 --> 13:29.977
Danny's in there.
DARREL:
I heard his gun go off.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.678
Anyone get hit?

13:31.711 --> 13:33.480
Oh, I couldn't see
inside the room.
All right,

13:33.513 --> 13:35.215
look, I need you to
tell Agent Brody

13:35.248 --> 13:36.950
everything you saw.

13:36.984 --> 13:40.988
All right?

13:41.021 --> 13:41.855
Chris,

13:41.889 --> 13:44.491
interface with JPSO.
Set up a perimeter.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.994
I'll see if I can
make contact with the gunman.

13:47.027 --> 13:49.462
All right, let's go.
Let's move! Move!

13:49.496 --> 13:51.364
Come on, go, go, go!

13:56.003 --> 13:58.538
I wasn't trying to shoot.
I swear to God.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.440
It's all right, Danny.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.675
Just breathe in easy.

14:02.709 --> 14:04.577
GUNMAN:
It wasn't supposed
to happen like this.

14:04.611 --> 14:05.678
None of it.

14:05.712 --> 14:07.080
Doc?
Shh, shh, shh.

14:07.114 --> 14:10.450
Don't talk. He needs
to get to a hospital.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.685
And I need to think.

14:12.719 --> 14:15.022
You hear me?
I need to think!

14:15.055 --> 14:17.790
What do we, uh...
what do we do for Danny?

14:17.824 --> 14:19.092
Get me some gauze
from the cabinet.

14:19.126 --> 14:20.760
Hey!

14:20.793 --> 14:22.795
I didn't say you could move.

14:22.829 --> 14:24.297
WADE:
No, but if he
doesn't receive

14:24.331 --> 14:26.934
medical attention, he will die,
making you a murderer.

14:26.967 --> 14:29.236
Doesn't seem like
that's why you came here.

14:29.269 --> 14:30.403
Just quiet!

14:30.437 --> 14:31.771
I'm a doctor!

14:31.804 --> 14:33.273
I can help him
if you just let me.

14:36.109 --> 14:38.378
SEBASTIAN:
Uh...

14:38.411 --> 14:40.480
I don't mean
to clutter your thinking,

14:40.513 --> 14:42.815
but I'm pretty sure that
standard operating procedure,

14:42.849 --> 14:46.419
if you don't make some sort
of contact is to, you know,

14:46.453 --> 14:48.755
storm the site.
I'm just...

14:48.788 --> 14:50.958
I'm providing you
with the facts.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.827
What?

14:54.861 --> 14:58.131
PRIDE:
Hear there's a situation
in there.

14:58.165 --> 15:01.668
I'm Dwayne Pride,
negotiator for the Navy.

15:01.701 --> 15:02.902
What's your name?

15:02.936 --> 15:04.337
Doesn't matter.

15:04.371 --> 15:06.039
Matters to me.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.874
I want to understand
what's going on,

15:07.907 --> 15:09.709
see if I can help.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.379
Maybe you feel like
you're standing on a ledge.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.914
Maybe things got
out of control,

15:14.948 --> 15:16.416
but if you'll
just talk to me,

15:16.449 --> 15:18.585
I can pull you back.

15:18.618 --> 15:22.922
First thing, I need to know
if anyone's been injured.

15:22.956 --> 15:26.559
Stupid kid. Went for my gun.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.895
Kid? Name's Danny.

15:28.928 --> 15:32.832
How about my other two people--
Loretta and Sebastian?

15:36.103 --> 15:38.171
Listen, I'm sure
you didn't mean to hurt Danny,

15:38.205 --> 15:41.041
but if he's been shot,
we got to get him some help.

15:41.074 --> 15:43.576
I don't want to see anyone else
get hurt, including you.

15:43.610 --> 15:44.944
Nice story,

15:44.978 --> 15:46.846
but I ain't buying your lies.

15:46.879 --> 15:48.448
You're just like
the rest of 'em.

15:48.481 --> 15:49.716
Rest of who?

15:51.818 --> 15:53.253
All right, look,
how about this?

15:53.286 --> 15:55.355
Why don't you tell me
what you want

15:55.388 --> 15:58.425
so we can both
figure our way out of this?

15:58.458 --> 16:01.261
What I want--

16:01.294 --> 16:03.763
no more calls,
no more in,

16:03.796 --> 16:05.132
no more out.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.666
No more contact.

16:06.699 --> 16:09.436
I see anyone,
anyone, come at me,

16:09.469 --> 16:13.206
and I promise,
gonna need a lot more body bags!

16:13.240 --> 16:15.808
Okay...

16:17.577 --> 16:19.979
(loud, overlapping shouting,
helicopter blades whirring)

16:21.481 --> 16:23.850
Jake.

16:23.883 --> 16:25.285
Glad you're here.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.187
JPSO's always
got your back, Dwayne.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.621
What's the word?

16:28.655 --> 16:29.989
Danny's been shot.

16:30.023 --> 16:31.691
Don't know how bad.

16:31.724 --> 16:34.794
Gunman doesn't seem to have
any kind of a plan.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.364
No demands. Not talking.
Where you at?

16:37.397 --> 16:38.965
All exits are covered.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.900
Snipers are on the rooftops.

16:40.933 --> 16:42.969
Monitoring phone lines,
disabling the Internet.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.871
Oh, blueprint of the morgue.

16:44.904 --> 16:46.739
Autopsy's in the back hallway.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.741
We need to talk
entry scenarios.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.910
No, we're not there yet, Jake.

16:50.943 --> 16:52.345
LASALLE:
Our friends--

16:52.379 --> 16:53.846
they're inside there.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.815
Understand that, and want
to get them out safe and sound,

16:55.848 --> 16:57.750
but given
this guy's not talking...

16:57.784 --> 16:59.886
We're gonna get him to talk.

16:59.919 --> 17:01.988
At the moment,
it's your boat, Pride.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.790
Just tell me where to row.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.725
How many guys
you got on the roof?

17:05.758 --> 17:07.394
Got three on
the east side...

17:07.427 --> 17:09.162
Got a description of the gunman.

17:09.196 --> 17:11.998
African-American,
black hat, striped shirt.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.133
Friend from the airport?

17:13.166 --> 17:15.068
One in the same.
PRIDE:
Okay.

17:15.102 --> 17:17.470
Well, Patton's still
running facial recognition.

17:17.504 --> 17:20.006
Hopefully, he'll be able to tell
us who the hell this guy is.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.808
One more thing-- Darrel said

17:21.841 --> 17:24.777
the gunman was trying to leave
with Armstrong's body.

17:26.379 --> 17:30.283
Gauze, Sebastian.

17:30.317 --> 17:32.185
What's wrong?

17:32.219 --> 17:35.088
It's my wrist. I must have
sprained it when I fell.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.659
Damn it!
Hemothorax.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.928
His lungs are filling
with blood.

17:41.961 --> 17:45.332
I need a scalpel, uh, iodine,

17:45.365 --> 17:47.934
a Kelly clamp
and a length of tubing.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.707
Think you're doing
with that blade, Slim?

17:54.741 --> 17:56.776
Drop it!
Oh, uh,

17:56.809 --> 17:58.811
I can see how this
might seem untoward.

17:58.845 --> 18:02.182
Now! And you--
on your feet, lady.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.784
I need your help.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.886
We need that scalpel
to insert a chest tube

18:06.919 --> 18:08.755
which will drain the blood
from his lungs.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.623
Otherwise,
Danny stops breathing.

18:10.657 --> 18:12.892
Actually, we need to
get him on a table.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.627
It don't sound like my problem.

18:14.661 --> 18:16.129
Son, it really is your problem.

18:16.163 --> 18:17.564
You need my help,

18:17.597 --> 18:18.798
but this boy needs it more.

18:18.831 --> 18:21.434
Now, we have
to trust each other.

18:21.468 --> 18:23.403
You just let me
take care of Danny,

18:23.436 --> 18:25.305
and then, I will do
whatever you want.

18:25.338 --> 18:26.773
Otherwise,

18:26.806 --> 18:28.408
you might as well
pull that trigger.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.382
What are you waiting for?

18:35.415 --> 18:38.151
So, this, uh...

18:38.185 --> 18:40.119
this whole surgery thing--
how you gonna do it?

18:40.153 --> 18:42.455
Not me.

18:42.489 --> 18:43.990
You.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.961
We're live
at the Jefferson Parish Morgue

18:48.995 --> 18:51.231
where a hostage situation
is unfolding.

18:51.264 --> 18:54.767
Well, you have him contact
me as soon as you find him.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.404
Trying to get in touch with
Armstrong's commanding officer,

18:57.437 --> 18:59.439
see if he has any insight

18:59.472 --> 19:01.741
into what's so important
about Armstrong's body.

19:01.774 --> 19:03.576
Might have good news here.

19:03.610 --> 19:06.813
Found an unattended van in the
parking lot behind the morgue.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.315
Reported stolen
earlier today.

19:08.348 --> 19:09.316
Could belong to our guy.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.083
Prints?
No, but I found

19:11.117 --> 19:13.019
this laptop inside,
password protected.

19:13.052 --> 19:14.687
Got to make that my bitch then.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.889
Meantime...

19:16.923 --> 19:18.858
I couldn't get
a make on the gunman,

19:18.891 --> 19:22.329
but I do know who he was trying
to call as he left the airport.

19:22.362 --> 19:25.432
You got his phone?
Yeah, right off his shades.
Check it out.

19:25.465 --> 19:26.999
See the reflection?

19:27.033 --> 19:28.501
He's dialing a number.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.370
Belongs to a Dr. Timofey Yeltin.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.272
Got an addy, too.

19:32.305 --> 19:34.341
All right, Chris,
Brody, you go check it out.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.776
No, I want to stay here.
So do I.

19:36.809 --> 19:39.011
Look, unless we know who he is

19:39.045 --> 19:41.581
and what he wants,
we can't talk him down.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.015
Answers are out there.

19:43.049 --> 19:45.418
Need you two to find 'em.

19:45.452 --> 19:47.387
We'll be in contact.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.889
All right.

19:53.960 --> 19:57.364
Good. Now to find
the seventh intercostal space.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.732
Here.

20:01.901 --> 20:05.638
Okay, now for
the one-inch incision.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.740
Sebastian, it's all
in your head.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.476
Its-it's pretty loud
in there right now.

20:09.509 --> 20:12.312
I don't really feel like
I'm in control here.

20:12.345 --> 20:13.580
You are.

20:13.613 --> 20:15.648
What about the
guy with the gun?

20:15.682 --> 20:18.485
Block him out. I need
for you to be a hero today.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.487
I'm not. I'm the sidekick.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.454
What's taking so long?

20:21.488 --> 20:22.889
Sebastian,

20:22.922 --> 20:26.225
under the talk,
the neuroses, the hives...

20:26.259 --> 20:27.727
is a hero.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.263
I saw it the first day
you walked into that lab.

20:30.297 --> 20:33.266
Now cut!

20:40.373 --> 20:41.841
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.443
I'm trying to save your life.

20:43.476 --> 20:44.977
Aah!

20:45.011 --> 20:46.413
All right.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.652
Now, keep going until
you hear a popping sound.

20:52.685 --> 20:55.154
And that's
Yeah, yeah.

20:55.187 --> 20:56.956
It means
that you're inside the chest.

20:56.989 --> 21:01.093
It will allow for the...
pressure to be relieved.

21:01.127 --> 21:02.929
Ow! Ooh!

21:02.962 --> 21:06.599
All right, now,
uh, Mr. Tube here.

21:16.075 --> 21:17.777
Danny? Danny,
look at me, look at me.

21:17.810 --> 21:22.048
Breathe slowly now.
Just slow, slow.

21:22.081 --> 21:24.684
There. Okay.

21:24.717 --> 21:27.854
Some good you are.

21:27.887 --> 21:30.256
In all my time dealing,
I never got shot.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.692
Then I start
working for you...

21:34.126 --> 21:37.296
Okay, just quiet.
Quiet, sweetie.

21:37.330 --> 21:39.899
Look, if I don't make
it, you got to tell...

21:39.932 --> 21:42.201
Oh, no, no, you're gonna
be fine, gonna be fine.

21:42.234 --> 21:44.236
But if I'm not...
No. No, just stop.

21:44.270 --> 21:45.938
You got to tell CJ...
Stop.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.974
Stop. You're gonna be just fine.

21:53.613 --> 21:55.615
There's two of them.

21:55.648 --> 21:59.752
Him and his little brother CJ--
nine years old.

22:02.221 --> 22:04.857
You have any siblings?

22:07.594 --> 22:09.996
Just finish up.

22:15.668 --> 22:18.337
Looks like the good
Dr. Yeltin doesn't believe

22:18.371 --> 22:20.039
in good housekeeping.

22:32.018 --> 22:34.153
NCIS!

22:34.186 --> 22:37.323
Doesn't sound like
anyone's home.

22:38.691 --> 22:41.661
Then again...
Ready?

22:55.608 --> 22:56.643
Okay!

23:01.781 --> 23:04.316
Get your hands in the air!
Let me see your hands!

23:06.052 --> 23:07.353
Get your ass on the ground!

23:07.386 --> 23:08.721
BRODY: Now!
Belly flat!

23:09.522 --> 23:10.790
Get on the ground!

23:10.823 --> 23:12.258
Aah!

23:12.291 --> 23:13.626
Ah, not again.

23:19.699 --> 23:21.200
Hey.

23:24.136 --> 23:26.372
You got it.
You hear that music?

23:26.405 --> 23:27.940
No, no, nyet.

23:27.974 --> 23:29.842
Is anybody else in the house?

23:29.876 --> 23:31.978
Is anybody else
in the house?!

23:32.011 --> 23:33.379
LASALLE:
I'll check it out.

23:40.019 --> 23:42.421
*

23:50.229 --> 23:51.664
What the...

23:51.698 --> 23:54.066
*

24:12.952 --> 24:15.688
What the hell
you been up to, Doc?

24:28.901 --> 24:31.203
No talk.

24:31.237 --> 24:32.739
No talk. America.
Rights. Da?

24:32.772 --> 24:34.473
Well, what about the rights
of that girl you murdered?

24:38.210 --> 24:39.846
No talk! No talk!

24:39.879 --> 24:42.048
NOPD's on the way.
You tell 'em
to bring a translator?

24:42.081 --> 24:44.150
'Cause I can't understand a word
Baryshnikov here is saying.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.289
Rosetta Stone. I was gonna
take a semester in Moscow,

24:50.322 --> 24:51.758
but it's too cold.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.395
Why I should talk to you?

24:56.428 --> 24:58.731
Because you're facing the
death penalty if you don't.

24:58.765 --> 24:59.866
How do you say
"lethal injection"?

24:59.899 --> 25:01.267
Uh, Rosetta Stone doesn't

25:01.300 --> 25:02.802
really cover stuff like that.

25:08.741 --> 25:10.543
I-I cut.

25:10.577 --> 25:12.712
Uh... girl was, uh...

25:12.745 --> 25:15.514
How do you say? Uh, donkey.

25:15.548 --> 25:18.184
Donkey Drug mule?

25:19.586 --> 25:22.154
Da.

25:22.188 --> 25:25.391
What does he have
to do with that dead girl?

25:25.424 --> 25:28.628
Marcus Martel?

25:28.661 --> 25:30.396
That's his name?
Da.

25:30.429 --> 25:33.165
Nothing to do with girl.

25:33.199 --> 25:37.536
Said he had body for me to cut.

25:41.073 --> 25:44.811
We got the connection between
Martel and this Dr. Yeltin?

25:44.844 --> 25:46.312
LASALLE:
They used to be colleagues.

25:46.345 --> 25:49.481
Both worked for a Colombian
drug cartel-- El Hacha.

25:49.515 --> 25:51.651
LASALLE:
Haven't ID'd the girl,

25:51.684 --> 25:54.086
but NOPD's on it, gonna keep us
apprised of where they are.

25:54.120 --> 25:57.356
Doctor said Martel was a
low-level dealer for the cartel.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.558
Then, one day,
he just left the game.

25:59.592 --> 26:01.761
Last doctor heard, he was
on the straight and narrow.

26:01.794 --> 26:04.230
Apparently, not
straight enough.

26:04.263 --> 26:06.398
Doctor say what was
inside Armstrong's body?

26:06.432 --> 26:08.735
Didn't know.
Martel hadn't told him.

26:08.768 --> 26:10.136
But if Armstrong was working
on that task force,

26:10.169 --> 26:12.504
taking down
a smuggling operation...

26:12.538 --> 26:14.841
He'd have access
to all kinds of contraband.

26:14.874 --> 26:16.175
Coke, heroin.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.644
And maybe Armstrong was using

26:17.677 --> 26:19.411
Martel's old connects
to move it.

26:19.445 --> 26:22.214
PRIDE:
Yeah, still, just a theory.
Pride?

26:23.482 --> 26:26.919
All right, Martel's
got an address

26:26.953 --> 26:28.988
near the Industrial Canal.
3434 Congress Street.

26:29.021 --> 26:30.790
Go. See what you can learn.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.191
We're on it, King.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.835
WADE:
Pulse is thready,
but constant.

26:42.869 --> 26:45.304
He's holding for now.
That makes one of us.

26:45.337 --> 26:47.674
Well, we've done
all we can.

26:47.707 --> 26:50.276
Danny still needs to
get to the hospital.

26:50.309 --> 26:53.680
And he will...

26:53.713 --> 26:55.982
soon as you live up
to your end of the bargain.

26:56.015 --> 26:57.950
Something inside him I need.

26:57.984 --> 27:01.220
I'm sorry.
Um, inside?

27:01.253 --> 27:04.290
Wax in your ears, Slim?

27:04.323 --> 27:06.558
No, I'm just... I'm assuming
that it's now my job

27:06.592 --> 27:08.861
to find this... thing,
and surprise, surprise.

27:08.895 --> 27:10.629
It's my maiden autopsy voyage.

27:10.663 --> 27:14.066
You'll know when you see it.

27:14.100 --> 27:18.037
Just do a Y-incision like
you've seen me do before.

27:18.070 --> 27:19.939
Shoulder to shoulder?

27:19.972 --> 27:22.141
Yes, then down the midline
to the base of the pubic bone.

27:22.174 --> 27:24.643
And make it...
Fast? Yeah, I know.

27:24.677 --> 27:26.545
But contrary to my wildest
dreams, I'm not Han Solo,

27:26.578 --> 27:27.947
this is not a lightsaber,

27:27.980 --> 27:29.581
and Mr. Armstrong
is not a Tauntaun.

27:29.615 --> 27:31.583
Now I can make this fast,
potentially destroying

27:31.617 --> 27:33.119
whatever this thing is
that you're looking for,

27:33.152 --> 27:35.221
or I can be meticulous,
which will take more time,

27:35.254 --> 27:36.889
but it will get you
what you want.

27:36.923 --> 27:38.991
I can't do both,
so, what's it gonna be, chief?

27:42.995 --> 27:46.833
Just get me what I want.

28:01.914 --> 28:03.215
Clear.

28:03.249 --> 28:05.651
It's like a vampire
lives in here.

28:05.684 --> 28:08.220
Dude likes his privacy.

28:08.254 --> 28:10.857
Look at this.

28:10.890 --> 28:13.525
There's Martel, Armstrong.

28:13.559 --> 28:15.227
Who's the third guy?

28:16.896 --> 28:19.698
WADE:
Your brother.

28:19.732 --> 28:21.233
This is about him, right?

28:21.267 --> 28:24.336
When I mentioned Danny's
brother CJ, you reacted.

28:24.370 --> 28:25.537
You're wrong.

28:25.571 --> 28:27.539
I don't think I am.
Okay.

28:27.573 --> 28:30.109
Feeling a little overwhelmed
here.
Okay, now just run

28:30.142 --> 28:32.111
the gut, dear.
Put pressure on the intestine

28:32.144 --> 28:36.415
and pull it
between your fingers.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.521
Does this remind anyone else

28:42.554 --> 28:46.125
of those Hammerpedes
from Prometheus?

28:46.158 --> 28:47.693
Yeah.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.096
Sorry. That movie
was a real letdown.

28:50.129 --> 28:52.098
Look, sir,
I can see you working very hard

28:52.131 --> 28:55.101
to present yourself
as some sort of monster,

28:55.134 --> 28:58.170
but it doesn't strike me
as real.

29:00.139 --> 29:03.675
You don't know a thing about me.

29:03.709 --> 29:05.677
Or my brother.

29:05.711 --> 29:09.115
No, but...

29:09.148 --> 29:12.151
I imagine you would like
to see him again.

29:12.184 --> 29:14.153
Yeah.

29:14.186 --> 29:17.556
I would.

29:17.589 --> 29:20.559
That ain't gonna happen.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.795
PRIDE:
Martel's brother is dead.

29:22.829 --> 29:24.330
Name was Nathan.

29:24.363 --> 29:26.465
Martel's only family.

29:26.498 --> 29:27.867
He was a SEAL.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.969
He was killed ten months ago.

29:30.002 --> 29:31.203
Combat?

29:31.237 --> 29:33.405
Details are classified.

29:33.439 --> 29:36.008
I'm in the process
of getting read in.

29:36.042 --> 29:38.010
Any word
from inside?
Radio silence.

29:38.044 --> 29:40.646
PATTON:
Okay, I got around
Martel's laptop Crack Sniffer.

29:40.679 --> 29:43.649
What?
No, it's not
what you're thinking.

29:43.682 --> 29:45.384
It's a program
that sniffs you out

29:45.417 --> 29:47.553
and locks you out the second
you try to crack in.

29:47.586 --> 29:49.221
And he hit the
mother lode.

29:49.255 --> 29:51.523
Okay, look. I went
through Martel's e-mails.

29:51.557 --> 29:53.025
I found dozens of requests
to the Navy asking

29:53.059 --> 29:56.728
for the classified story
about his brother's death.

29:56.762 --> 29:59.598
And then there's this
big ol' angry manifesto.

29:59.631 --> 30:02.268
PATTON:
And on the end...

30:02.301 --> 30:04.770
PRIDE:
"Because you won't release
the truth about Nate,

30:04.803 --> 30:07.439
I'm releasing everything
I've gotten my hands on"?

30:07.473 --> 30:10.142
Well, is there any proof
he's really got something?

30:14.446 --> 30:16.748
There it is.

30:24.623 --> 30:28.027
SEBASTIAN:
Is that a flash drive?

30:28.060 --> 30:29.828
What's on that?

30:31.397 --> 30:34.000
Payback.

30:42.141 --> 30:44.576
What is this?

30:51.617 --> 30:53.485
Captain Dawson.

30:53.519 --> 30:55.121
You're a hard man
to get

30:55.154 --> 30:56.655
ahold of.
Dealing with
the cluster

30:56.688 --> 30:58.157
on my end, Pride.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.591
I'd like you to meet

30:59.625 --> 31:02.161
FBI SWAT Team
Leader Marie Cutter.

31:02.194 --> 31:04.196
FBI? Look.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Look.

31:04.230 --> 31:06.532
We just learned the identity
of the gunman

31:06.565 --> 31:08.300
and why he's doing this.

31:08.334 --> 31:09.868
We think we can talk him down.

31:09.902 --> 31:12.204
We just need a little more time.
And your work's

31:12.238 --> 31:14.540
much appreciated,
but time's up.

31:14.573 --> 31:16.542
FBI's taking over.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.864
Dawson, come on.
You duck my calls,

31:38.897 --> 31:41.533
leave me in the dark,
and then within ten seconds

31:41.567 --> 31:43.869
of showing up, you're gonna
instigate a firefight?

31:43.902 --> 31:46.705
Two days ago, Petty Officer
Armstrong downloaded thousands

31:46.738 --> 31:50.376
of classified documents
onto a flash drive.
Troop movements,

31:50.409 --> 31:52.378
weapon capabilities,
undercover assets.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.947
Not quite Snowden
but approaching.
Son of a bitch

31:54.981 --> 31:57.383
swallowed the drive to sneak out
of our secure facilities,

31:57.416 --> 31:58.750
which is why we got
to get in.

31:58.784 --> 32:00.919
We're talking national security
here, Pride.

32:00.953 --> 32:02.955
Well, what about the security
of my people?

32:02.989 --> 32:05.524
The needs of the many
outweigh the needs of the few.

32:05.557 --> 32:06.993
Sorry, Pride.

32:11.597 --> 32:13.565
Went over the blueprint.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.867
No surprises to us.

32:15.901 --> 32:18.904
Autopsy's in back.
Only one way in and out.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.640
Tactical goes in there,
it's gonna be a turkey shoot.

32:21.673 --> 32:24.410
And protocol says wait until
there's an imminent threat.

32:28.847 --> 32:30.916
Guess those documents fit
their bill.

32:36.588 --> 32:37.523
Let me ask you this.

32:37.556 --> 32:39.691
Is there any chance

32:39.725 --> 32:42.061
that the file
on his brother's death,

32:42.094 --> 32:43.829
the one Martel requested,

32:43.862 --> 32:47.033
is on the flash drive
that Armstrong smuggled in?

32:47.066 --> 32:48.434
Probably not.

32:48.467 --> 32:50.269
Didn't have any access.

32:50.302 --> 32:51.403
But we do.

32:51.437 --> 32:52.704
How long
would it take you

32:52.738 --> 32:53.739
to get me that file?

32:53.772 --> 32:55.407
15 minutes, give or take.

32:55.441 --> 32:57.276
All right. You got five.

32:57.309 --> 32:58.910
Five?!

33:02.814 --> 33:04.916
Pride.

33:04.950 --> 33:06.485
King.

33:06.518 --> 33:08.187
What the hell you gonna do?

33:11.790 --> 33:14.626
What the...?

33:16.995 --> 33:19.965
Pride!
Pride! Get your ass
back here!

33:19.998 --> 33:20.999
Can't do that!

33:21.033 --> 33:22.301
CUTTER:
Ordering you

33:22.334 --> 33:23.669
to stand down!

33:23.702 --> 33:25.504
Give me five minutes!

33:25.537 --> 33:28.740
Then the show is all yours!

33:35.481 --> 33:37.149
Damn it.

33:37.183 --> 33:38.984
Agent Pride has breached
the building.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.553
All units,
hold positions.

33:41.587 --> 33:45.557
SEBASTIAN:
Uh, not sure
what your plan is

33:45.591 --> 33:48.560
since disabling the Internet
is Hostage Protocol 101.

33:48.594 --> 33:50.462
You can't put those files
online.

33:50.496 --> 33:53.199
MARTEL:
Can when this thing accesses
an offsite hot spot.

33:53.232 --> 33:55.834
Tether it to your computer,

33:55.867 --> 33:58.837
and you're in business.

34:02.941 --> 34:05.611
No.

34:05.644 --> 34:08.046
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

34:08.080 --> 34:12.050
He encrypted this! Why the hell
would Armstrong do that?!

34:12.084 --> 34:15.487
It's a smart way to control
how the files are disseminated.

34:15.521 --> 34:16.688
Damn it!

34:17.923 --> 34:19.958
PRIDE:
Marcus Martel?

34:19.991 --> 34:21.427
I'm Dwayne Pride.

34:21.460 --> 34:24.996
One who talked to you
on the phone before.

34:25.030 --> 34:27.166
I told you not
to come in here!

34:27.199 --> 34:29.301
I'm unarmed.

34:29.335 --> 34:31.337
Here to help.

34:31.370 --> 34:33.339
You got three seconds!

34:33.372 --> 34:35.474
Three seconds to leave
or someone dies!

34:35.507 --> 34:39.445
Marcus, FBI's outside
this building.

34:39.478 --> 34:43.449
I'm the only reason they're not
storming in here right now.

34:43.482 --> 34:45.884
Here to save
your life, son.

34:47.119 --> 34:49.321
Life don't need saving.

34:49.355 --> 34:52.023
Then tell me what you do need.

34:56.495 --> 35:00.199
An encryption specialist!

35:00.232 --> 35:01.967
Get one
in here now!

35:02.000 --> 35:04.170
FBI's not gonna let that happen.

35:04.203 --> 35:07.406
Besides,
I don't think

35:07.439 --> 35:09.308
you really care
about those files you stole.

35:14.980 --> 35:18.016
The one you... need,

35:18.049 --> 35:20.118
the one you want,

35:20.152 --> 35:23.922
truth about your brother.
All you got to do is let me in.

35:28.627 --> 35:30.929
Keep your hands up.

35:30.962 --> 35:33.965
Inside. Move. Now.

35:36.602 --> 35:38.370
How is he?
He's lost

35:38.404 --> 35:39.605
a liter of blood.

35:43.342 --> 35:46.212
You got the file on my brother?

35:46.245 --> 35:48.113
PRIDE:
I do.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.549
And I'll show it to you.

35:50.582 --> 35:52.718
But you got to let us

35:52.751 --> 35:54.220
take Danny out,

35:54.253 --> 35:56.388
get him the attention he needs.

35:56.422 --> 35:58.224
Yeah.

35:58.257 --> 36:00.559
And what about
what Nathan needed?

36:00.592 --> 36:02.127
Hmm?

36:02.160 --> 36:04.029
He goes off

36:04.062 --> 36:07.699
and he dies for his country,

36:07.733 --> 36:10.269
and they won't tell me nothing
about what happened to him.

36:13.339 --> 36:15.974
He was my best friend.

36:16.007 --> 36:20.379
The only one
who ever believed in me.

36:20.412 --> 36:22.381
Nate.

36:22.414 --> 36:24.983
Little Nate
with the... bright eyes

36:25.016 --> 36:29.187
and the... crazy smile.

36:29.221 --> 36:31.690
A smile I will never see again.

36:31.723 --> 36:33.091
WADE:
We understand, Marcus.

36:33.124 --> 36:35.026
You don't.

36:35.060 --> 36:36.495
And you can't.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.897
I can.

36:38.930 --> 36:42.334
What you want,

36:42.368 --> 36:44.670
the how and the why

36:44.703 --> 36:47.573
of a loved one's death, that's
what we do here. For instance,

36:47.606 --> 36:51.877
your friend,
Petty Officer Armstrong...

36:51.910 --> 36:53.612
Just stop.

36:53.645 --> 36:57.616
When we opened him up,

36:57.649 --> 37:00.118
I saw his
enlarged heart.

37:00.151 --> 37:02.120
Considering
he was using dalteparin,

37:02.153 --> 37:05.624
I'm guessing
he died of cardiac arrest

37:05.657 --> 37:08.427
brought on by the stress
of what you two were doing.

37:08.460 --> 37:09.961
You saying it's my fault?
I'm saying

37:09.995 --> 37:11.797
one man's perished for this.

37:11.830 --> 37:14.433
Let's not make it two.

37:14.466 --> 37:17.436
Think of
Danny's brother.

37:17.469 --> 37:23.174
You want to take from him
what was taken from you?

37:26.678 --> 37:30.782
I need some help!

37:30.816 --> 37:32.718
BRODY:
Get that ambulance over here!
Now!

37:36.722 --> 37:38.189
SEBASTIAN: Easy, easy.
LASALLE: Watch it.

37:38.223 --> 37:40.992
What do we got?
Single gunshot.
Small caliber bullet.

37:41.026 --> 37:42.528
It's lodged in his
upper thoracic region.

37:42.561 --> 37:44.062
Here we go.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.398
Let's get him in.
Come on, come on, come on!

37:46.432 --> 37:48.500
One, two... You-you
can't come with us!

37:48.534 --> 37:50.502
I'm tired of people telling me
what I can't do today.

37:50.536 --> 37:52.504
I'm staying with him till I know
he's all right. Come on.

37:52.538 --> 37:54.806
Sebastian, Pride and Wade?

37:54.840 --> 37:57.509
They're both fine, but
it's still pretty touch and go.

38:01.913 --> 38:04.149
Marcus.

38:04.182 --> 38:07.653
I don't understand.

38:08.687 --> 38:11.490
Your brother
was killed

38:11.523 --> 38:14.259
by the
al-Majid Front.

38:15.861 --> 38:18.997
Rebels who were...

38:19.030 --> 38:22.434
working secretly
with our government.

38:22.468 --> 38:27.573
Al-Majid was supposed
to help our SEALs

38:27.606 --> 38:29.575
take down
a Syrian government official.

38:29.608 --> 38:31.810
Instead...

38:31.843 --> 38:34.846
they turned on 'em.

38:37.616 --> 38:40.586
All these lies...

38:40.619 --> 38:43.555
Someone has to pay for this,
right?

38:53.565 --> 38:56.868
Marcus, the FBI's about
to come through that door.

38:56.902 --> 38:59.337
I know.

39:01.239 --> 39:04.476
Then are you ready to end this?

39:20.892 --> 39:23.294
Easy, easy!
Situation's under control!

39:25.731 --> 39:28.099
Nobody's dying here today!

39:31.136 --> 39:33.739
(indistinct police radio
transmission)

39:49.655 --> 39:51.623
DAWSON:
Thank you very much,
Agent.

39:51.657 --> 39:53.692
Appreciate all your help.
CUTTER: No problem.

39:55.761 --> 39:58.730
PRIDE:
Captain.

39:58.764 --> 40:01.132
We've got
some unresolved business.

40:01.166 --> 40:03.635
I should say so.

40:03.669 --> 40:06.505
The business
of divulging state secrets.

40:06.538 --> 40:09.074
I was protecting my people.
Not good practice.

40:09.107 --> 40:11.910
Neither was the handling
of Nathan Martel's death.

40:11.943 --> 40:14.580
Department of Defense makes
that decision, not the Navy.

40:14.613 --> 40:16.782
And now thanks to you,
Marcus Martel can tell that

40:16.815 --> 40:18.016
to anyone who'll listen.

40:18.049 --> 40:20.185
One document
as opposed to thousands.

40:20.218 --> 40:22.488
And maybe saved a few lives.

40:22.521 --> 40:24.923
I'm sure there'll be a hearing
to debate whether or not

40:24.956 --> 40:26.357
what I did was right...

40:28.059 --> 40:29.628
...but there's no debate
to this.

40:29.661 --> 40:30.929
That man's brother,
Nathan Martel,

40:30.962 --> 40:33.164
deserves a Bronze Star.

40:33.198 --> 40:35.667
Not my call to make, Pride.
Find someone

40:35.701 --> 40:37.503
who can.

40:37.536 --> 40:39.938
Kid died a hero.

40:39.971 --> 40:42.373
Deserves to be remembered
that way.

40:53.018 --> 40:55.420
* Carry me

40:57.823 --> 41:00.559
* For a while

41:02.894 --> 41:04.863
* It's your turn

41:04.896 --> 41:06.865
* To lend

41:06.898 --> 41:08.900
* A hand

41:10.902 --> 41:15.473
* Carry you

41:15.507 --> 41:19.811
* For a while...

41:21.012 --> 41:24.415
Lasalle and Brody
went to get CJ.

41:24.449 --> 41:25.917
Any updates?

41:25.951 --> 41:28.253
Uh, he's stable.

41:28.286 --> 41:30.589
The doctors will come back
and check on him in an hour.

41:30.622 --> 41:33.224
Okay.

41:33.258 --> 41:35.260
Tough kid.

41:35.293 --> 41:38.096
He'll be okay.

41:38.129 --> 41:40.532
Yeah.

41:43.201 --> 41:46.404
Heard Sebastian dug deep today.

41:46.437 --> 41:48.406
He did indeed.

41:48.439 --> 41:51.442
Sidekick no longer.

41:53.278 --> 41:57.949
He's been my silver lining
in an otherwise cloudy day.

42:00.952 --> 42:03.488
How you holding up?

42:03.521 --> 42:04.556
Me? Oh.

42:04.590 --> 42:07.258
This is nothing.

42:08.359 --> 42:11.362
I'm not talking about that.

42:13.031 --> 42:16.434
I'm fine, Dwayne.

42:16.467 --> 42:19.070
Loretta...

42:19.104 --> 42:23.642
No, I'm-I'm okay.

42:25.877 --> 42:28.279
I'm okay.

42:29.748 --> 42:33.318
:
I'm okay.

42:34.920 --> 42:37.288
You are now.

42:39.257 --> 42:42.227
You are now.
