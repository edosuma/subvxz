I've worked all

02:52.765 --> 02:54.765

I can't remember.

02:54.834 --> 02:56.200
Makes all the sense
in the world.

02:56.269 --> 02:57.301
He was your friend.

02:57.370 --> 02:58.769
Nick Taylor.

02:58.838 --> 03:01.505
He was spooked
about something.

03:01.574 --> 03:02.607
Any idea what?

03:02.675 --> 03:04.642
Never got a chance to find out.

03:04.711 --> 03:06.644
It all happened so fast,
I couldn't.

03:06.713 --> 03:09.480
If only I'd have gotten here
a moment earlier...

03:09.549 --> 03:11.093
A moment earlier, and I would
have been investigating

03:11.117 --> 03:12.717
your death right now, too.

03:12.785 --> 03:14.719
That's not something
I'm ready for.

03:14.787 --> 03:16.187
Nothing you could've done, P.

03:16.256 --> 03:18.189
Well, can we cover him up?

03:18.258 --> 03:20.358
I don't want to leave him out
here like that.

03:20.426 --> 03:24.028
You're right, Patton.
I'll take care of it.

03:24.097 --> 03:25.730
I'll make sure
you get home, okay?

03:25.798 --> 03:27.698
No, no, I should
stay here and help, man.

03:27.767 --> 03:29.133
You're not a field agent.

03:29.202 --> 03:30.968
Plus, you're
in shock, okay?

03:31.037 --> 03:32.970
Just hold tight.

03:37.710 --> 03:39.677
There's three shots,
as far as I can tell.

03:39.746 --> 03:42.079
One in the shoulder,
one in the abdomen,

03:42.148 --> 03:43.347
one in the prosthetic leg.

03:43.416 --> 03:44.548
He bled out.

03:44.617 --> 03:45.883
Seems like a drive-by.

03:45.952 --> 03:47.351
And considering
that, uh,

03:47.420 --> 03:50.221
Patton said Nick was
nervous about something...

03:50.290 --> 03:51.689
It's a targeted shooting.

03:51.758 --> 03:53.591
I spoke to NOPD.

03:53.660 --> 03:55.393
No one else was
in the parking lot.

03:55.461 --> 03:56.494
So no witnesses?

03:56.562 --> 03:58.029
Other than Patton.

03:58.097 --> 04:01.499
We need to look at CCTV,
check traffic cams.

04:01.567 --> 04:05.536
Find the car, find our suspect.

04:05.605 --> 04:07.838
Nick Taylor was
a wounded warrior.

04:07.907 --> 04:09.674
Who would want to target him?

04:09.742 --> 04:11.676
Let's find out.

Advertise your product or brand here

04:23.423 --> 04:26.424
Specialist Nick Taylor was
a former Navy SEAL,

04:26.492 --> 04:30.294
uh, before losing his leg in an
ambush in Afghanistan in 2004.

04:30.363 --> 04:32.007
But he still managed
to save the rest of his unit

04:32.031 --> 04:33.898
under heavy fire.
Earned a Silver Star.

04:33.967 --> 04:36.300
Injured 14 years ago,
still on active duty?

04:36.369 --> 04:39.470
Taylor got back into the service
through the Valor Brigade.

04:39.539 --> 04:40.571
What's the Valor Brigade?

04:40.640 --> 04:41.973
PRIDE:
Local organization

04:42.041 --> 04:44.208
that works with the military

04:44.277 --> 04:46.110
to train injured vets

04:46.179 --> 04:48.279
for careers as analysts
in law enforcement.

04:48.348 --> 04:50.247
Pride?

04:52.452 --> 04:54.986
Patton's friend was murdered.

04:55.054 --> 04:56.721
Where else am I gonna be?

04:56.789 --> 05:00.491
You just got reinstated
back into your SAC position.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.293
Figured you'd be needed
at Belle Chasse.

05:02.362 --> 05:04.039
Well, good thing about being
the boss, Christopher,

05:04.063 --> 05:07.498
is that I get to decide
where I'm needed, so...

05:08.835 --> 05:10.768
Plus, I brought breakfast.

05:12.739 --> 05:15.072
What kind of work was Taylor
doing with the Valor Brigade?

05:15.141 --> 05:17.274
Well, after he rehabbed
his injury,

05:17.343 --> 05:20.111
Navy trained and transferred him
to intelligence.

05:20.179 --> 05:21.612
Yeah, his last assignment was

05:21.681 --> 05:23.525
a joint drug interdiction task
force with the Coast Guard.

05:23.549 --> 05:26.684
Analyzing statistical data
for narcotics busts.

05:26.753 --> 05:28.297
Well, we need to speak
to his supervisor.

05:28.321 --> 05:29.487
- Yeah.
PATTON: Wow.

05:29.555 --> 05:31.489
I'm usually the first one
in the office.

05:31.557 --> 05:33.491
I got to get my mindfulness on

05:33.559 --> 05:35.159
before I start
catching bad guys.

05:35.228 --> 05:36.360
You okay, baby?

05:36.429 --> 05:37.673
Oh, I'll be better
once I start working.

05:37.697 --> 05:39.330
I got to find Nick's killer.

05:39.399 --> 05:40.642
PRIDE: Well, we can
definitely use your help,

05:40.666 --> 05:44.001
but you need
to pace yourself, huh?

05:44.070 --> 05:46.771
I'm paced just fine.

05:46.839 --> 05:48.773
Have you seen
a trauma counselor yet?

05:48.841 --> 05:50.808
I got plenty of time
to talk about my feelings.

05:50.877 --> 05:53.644
You know the first 48 hours of
a murder investigation are key.

05:53.713 --> 05:55.146
LASALLE:
Yeah, P.

05:55.214 --> 05:56.380
We know.

05:56.449 --> 05:58.115
Well, let's go. Chop, chop.

06:01.087 --> 06:04.288
I dug into Taylor's
recent activity.

06:04.357 --> 06:06.891
Last place he went before he was
shot was Crane Rehab Center.

06:06.959 --> 06:09.160
Doing PT, I guess.

06:09.228 --> 06:11.695
You know, the Crane Center
is more than just rehab.

06:11.764 --> 06:13.531
It's like a clubhouse,

06:13.599 --> 06:15.699
a sanctuary,
a place to let off steam.

06:15.768 --> 06:18.035
That's where I met Nick
back in the day.

06:18.104 --> 06:19.303
So, worth checking out.

06:19.372 --> 06:20.638
HANNAH:
Lasalle, Gregorio,

06:20.706 --> 06:22.084
head over to the rehab center.
See if anyone

06:22.108 --> 06:23.841
noticed anything
off with Taylor.

06:23.910 --> 06:26.310
Let's get in touch
with Taylor's CO,

06:26.379 --> 06:28.846
get some background on his work
with the Coast Guard.

06:30.383 --> 06:32.116
Oh, you ain't got to tell me.

06:32.185 --> 06:35.086
I'm-a go dig into
Taylor's digital life.

06:38.424 --> 06:41.859
You want to work the case,
I'm not stopping you.

06:41.928 --> 06:43.906
But you're making an appointment
with the trauma counselor.

06:43.930 --> 06:45.896
- Pride, I...
- Non-negotiable.

06:49.102 --> 06:51.902
I've been through
what you're facing.

06:51.971 --> 06:56.107
You need to get in front of it
before it gets away from you.

07:09.989 --> 07:11.600
Ever think about what
you would do if you...

07:11.624 --> 07:12.890
Nope. Don't even go there.

07:12.959 --> 07:14.269
I don't even want to
put that possibility

07:14.293 --> 07:15.793
out into the universe.

07:15.862 --> 07:17.261
Well, I think about it.

07:17.330 --> 07:18.896
I mean, it comes
with the territory

07:18.965 --> 07:20.931
with this job, Gregorio.
- And?

07:21.000 --> 07:24.969
LASALLE: Eh, as long as I got fishing
and golf to help keep me sane,

07:25.037 --> 07:26.582
- I'd be a'ight.
- Oh, it's kind of hard

07:26.606 --> 07:28.772
to swing a nine iron
sitting down, no?

07:28.841 --> 07:30.574
Well, it's the 21st century.

07:30.643 --> 07:32.187
Yeah, they got machines that
help you stand up

07:32.211 --> 07:33.944
playing golf now.

07:34.013 --> 07:38.115
Excuse me, sir, uh, we need some
information on a Nick Taylor.

07:38.184 --> 07:39.495
You're gonna want to talk
to his therapist, Julia.

07:39.519 --> 07:40.662
She's just around the corner.

07:40.686 --> 07:42.386
Okay. Thank you.

07:42.455 --> 07:44.255
- Oh!
- You good, friend?

07:44.323 --> 07:46.323
I was three seconds
shy of my record.

07:46.392 --> 07:48.125
Sorry, we didn't mean
to distract you.

07:48.194 --> 07:50.928
Just means he gets another
chance to break his record.

07:50.997 --> 07:52.341
Come on, you got this, Zan.
Let's go again.

07:52.365 --> 07:53.764
Hey, keep up the good work.

07:57.904 --> 07:59.837
Was I not supposed to say that?

07:59.906 --> 08:02.173
I don't know.

08:02.241 --> 08:04.008
JULIA:
And breathe...

08:04.076 --> 08:05.876
GREGORIO:
Excuse me.

08:05.945 --> 08:08.145
Julia Flores?
Yeah?

08:08.214 --> 08:10.492
I'm Special Agent Gregorio,
this is Special Agent Lasalle.

08:10.516 --> 08:12.449
We'd like to talk to you
about Nick Taylor.

08:12.518 --> 08:13.878
SIMMS:
Yeah, questions got to wait.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.186
She's busy.

08:15.254 --> 08:16.965
- Oh, it'll only take a few minutes.
- Yeah?

08:16.989 --> 08:18.901
Well, we only got 20 minutes
left in the session,

08:18.925 --> 08:21.992
and I want to get on
the E-Stim bike, so back off.

08:22.061 --> 08:23.906
I already told you that's not
happening today, Kevin.

08:23.930 --> 08:25.874
And I already told you
that I am sick of stretching.

08:25.898 --> 08:27.865
What's that, NOPD?

08:27.934 --> 08:29.033
You were a cop?

08:29.101 --> 08:30.634
I am a cop.

08:30.703 --> 08:31.914
Fact that I got one leg
surprising to you?

08:31.938 --> 08:33.304
Not at all.

08:33.371 --> 08:34.383
The fact that you don't know

08:34.407 --> 08:35.751
that this is an official
investigation is.

08:35.775 --> 08:37.753
- Now, can we talk to you, please?
- Yes, my office.

08:37.777 --> 08:38.777
Thank you.

08:39.912 --> 08:41.712
Practice breathing
with your diaphragm.

08:41.780 --> 08:44.114
Yeah?
(inhales, exhales)

08:44.183 --> 08:45.616
I'll be right back.

08:45.685 --> 08:47.284
(inhales, exhales)

08:47.353 --> 08:49.954
I'm sorry about Kevin.

08:50.022 --> 08:51.989
Everyone adjusts in
their own time,

08:52.058 --> 08:54.058
he just hasn't really
accepted his injury yet.

08:54.126 --> 08:55.459
It's the hardest part.

08:55.528 --> 08:56.688
Well, what about Nick Taylor?

08:56.729 --> 08:58.195
Did he have a hard time
adjusting?

08:58.264 --> 09:01.632
Nick? No. He, um,
he's an old hand at this,

09:01.701 --> 09:05.903
so he's helped a lot of
the others adjust. Is he okay?

09:05.972 --> 09:08.906
Um, I'm afraid not.
He was murdered last night.

09:11.544 --> 09:13.377
Wh...

09:13.446 --> 09:14.979
Are you okay?

09:15.047 --> 09:19.583
Sorry. I just haven't
lost a patient before.

09:21.387 --> 09:23.554
What happened?

09:23.623 --> 09:25.089
Drive-by shooting.

09:25.157 --> 09:27.758
Did you get a sense
that Nick was in trouble?

09:27.827 --> 09:29.727
Or anyone have a beef with him?

09:29.795 --> 09:31.095
Nick is the sweetest guy.

09:31.163 --> 09:32.407
Nobody would ever
want to hurt him.

09:32.431 --> 09:33.431
Were you close?

09:34.767 --> 09:36.433
Yes, I'm close
with all my patients.

09:36.502 --> 09:37.568
(clears throat)

09:38.938 --> 09:41.705
Look, ma'am,
you can't even stand up.

09:41.774 --> 09:43.907
What aren't you telling us?

09:43.976 --> 09:46.010
My God, if anybody found out...

09:46.078 --> 09:47.878
Found out what?

09:47.947 --> 09:52.283
Nick and I, we're, we're--
we're involved.

09:52.351 --> 09:55.052
- Doesn't sound exactly ethical.
- It's not.

09:55.121 --> 09:56.887
That's why we were
quiet about it.

09:56.956 --> 09:59.481
I didn't plan for this to happen,
it just sort of did, you know?

09:59.482 --> 10:01.292
LASALLE:
Well, that means

10:01.360 --> 10:03.594
you knew him better
than anyone else here.

10:03.663 --> 10:06.864
Can you keep this
between us, please?

10:06.932 --> 10:08.510
I really don't want anyone
to find out about this.

10:08.534 --> 10:09.900
Yeah, listen,

10:09.969 --> 10:11.535
we're not trying
to jam you up here.

10:11.604 --> 10:13.771
We just need some help
figuring out why he was killed.

10:13.839 --> 10:17.474
Yeah, of course.

10:17.543 --> 10:19.109
Okay, what can I do?

10:19.178 --> 10:20.911
Well, start by telling us

10:20.980 --> 10:24.148
everything you know
about Nick Taylor.

10:24.216 --> 10:25.549
WADE: I dropped by
Patton's place

10:25.618 --> 10:27.484
this morning just
to check up on him.

10:27.553 --> 10:28.508
He wasn't there.

10:28.532 --> 10:30.221
No, he was at NCIS,
working the case.

10:30.222 --> 10:31.742
Ah, throwing himself
back into the job.

10:31.791 --> 10:33.724
Yeah. It's what
every one of us would do.

10:33.793 --> 10:36.560
Oh, yeah, but the way that
he's acting, it's almost as if

10:36.629 --> 10:38.829
he didn't see his friend
murdered in front of him.

10:38.898 --> 10:40.309
I'm not sure there's
an appropriate way

10:40.333 --> 10:41.832
to act in that situation.

10:41.901 --> 10:44.668
Probably true. But I sent him
to a trauma counselor

10:44.737 --> 10:46.170
to at least
get the ball rolling.

10:46.238 --> 10:48.672
Good. He needs all
the help he can get.

10:51.277 --> 10:52.676
SEBASTIAN:
Thanks.

10:52.745 --> 10:54.978
Where did you come from?

10:55.047 --> 10:57.681
Accessible entrance
around the back.

10:57.750 --> 10:59.750
Shouldn't you be
with the counselor?

10:59.819 --> 11:02.619
We met, we talked, we
agreed I should be here.

11:02.688 --> 11:05.189
I need to see my friend.

11:05.291 --> 11:06.835
The trauma counselor told you
should come to autopsy

11:06.859 --> 11:08.125
to see his body?

11:08.194 --> 11:09.460
Technically, I told her.

11:09.528 --> 11:11.528
But you left
before she could argue.

11:14.166 --> 11:15.466
This is not a good idea.

11:15.534 --> 11:17.468
You were supposed to give
the trauma counselor

11:17.536 --> 11:18.419
a chance.

11:18.420 --> 11:20.671
Pride,
I'm a grown man.

11:20.740 --> 11:22.673
I watched him die.

11:22.742 --> 11:24.875
I want to see my friend.

11:26.212 --> 11:27.711
(quietly):
Yeah.

11:37.456 --> 11:39.390
He's not here, huh?

11:40.559 --> 11:43.193
No. Nick's gone.

11:44.530 --> 11:45.996
We'll give you a moment.

11:47.233 --> 11:49.166
What did you find, Doc?

11:56.942 --> 11:59.042
Nick was shot three times.

11:59.111 --> 12:00.644
One lodged
in the prosthetic leg,

12:00.713 --> 12:03.213
one in the shoulder
and the last one missed

12:03.282 --> 12:07.217
most of his vital organs,
but nicked the abdominal aorta

12:07.286 --> 12:08.852
and he bled out in minutes.

12:08.921 --> 12:10.521
You gonna be able
to run ballistics?

12:10.589 --> 12:12.723
The two bullets in Nick
shattered on impact,

12:12.792 --> 12:15.159
but the one in the leg
is still in good condition.

12:16.262 --> 12:18.195
Man, this thing is badass.

12:18.264 --> 12:20.898
I've never seen a prosthesis
this high tech before.

12:20.966 --> 12:22.377
(phone buzzing)
DARPA's been working on

12:22.401 --> 12:23.934
an advanced prosthetic

12:24.003 --> 12:26.336
that'll allow soldiers
to get back in combat.

12:26.405 --> 12:29.173
(phone buzzing)
Nick was part of the pilot program.

12:29.241 --> 12:30.881
Think you'll be able
to remove the bullet?

12:30.976 --> 12:32.609
(phone buzzing)
PATTON: Sebastian.

12:32.678 --> 12:35.546
He asked you a question, man.
Check your texts later.

12:35.614 --> 12:37.559
I'm not checking my texts.
E-Every time I move closer

12:37.583 --> 12:40.217
to this leg, my phone vibrates.

12:40.286 --> 12:41.218
What's it mean?

12:41.287 --> 12:44.388
Let me see that phone?

12:44.457 --> 12:47.090
(phone buzzing, crackling)

12:47.159 --> 12:48.892
Could you take that foot off,
please?

12:55.301 --> 12:57.234
Let me see.

12:57.303 --> 12:58.569
Give me some tweezers.

13:05.110 --> 13:06.710
Some sort of memory card?

13:06.779 --> 13:08.245
Looks like an aftermarket.

13:08.314 --> 13:09.947
Aftermarket for what purpose?

13:10.015 --> 13:12.649
I think Taylor's leg was bugged.

13:15.054 --> 13:17.421
Think you can access
what's on that thing?

13:17.490 --> 13:18.956
What kind of question is that?

13:19.024 --> 13:20.657
A stupid one, apparently.

13:20.726 --> 13:23.560
Someone's gonna have to explain
to the civilians here

13:23.629 --> 13:26.463
how is that thing a bug?

13:26.532 --> 13:29.166
It's a keyboard sniffer.

13:29.235 --> 13:32.169
It logs everything you do
on a computer.

13:32.238 --> 13:33.971
It's not supposed
to react like this.

13:34.039 --> 13:35.799
Must have gotten damaged
during the shooting.

13:36.809 --> 13:38.775
You got it, P. What's on it?

13:41.647 --> 13:43.413
A treasure trove.

13:43.482 --> 13:46.850
A treasure trove of what?

13:46.919 --> 13:48.919
Classified Navy Intel.

13:50.523 --> 13:52.789
Looks like Nick
Taylor was a spy.

14:04.808 --> 14:07.284
PRIDE: Nick Taylor removed
classified material

14:07.285 --> 14:09.552
from the Coast Guard
joint task force

14:09.621 --> 14:12.122
using a bug hidden
in his prosthesis.

14:12.190 --> 14:14.624
By all appearances,
he was a spy.

14:14.693 --> 14:18.061
Patton is convinced
that isn't true.

14:18.130 --> 14:19.690
Well, a spy isn't
very good if you can't

14:19.731 --> 14:21.030
deceive the people around you.

14:21.099 --> 14:22.499
Do you think
he's right?

14:22.567 --> 14:24.734
What I think is
that we need to know more.

14:24.803 --> 14:27.203
And Patton's gonna keep
investigating with us?

14:27.272 --> 14:29.072
Well, he's our computer
specialist.

14:29.141 --> 14:33.576
And he knows the victim
better than anyone else.

14:33.645 --> 14:37.013
I'll follow your lead on that.

14:37.082 --> 14:38.314
But?

14:38.383 --> 14:42.318
If we find more evidence
pointing to Taylor

14:42.387 --> 14:43.586
being a spy,

14:43.655 --> 14:45.155
Patton might not
be able to handle it.

14:45.223 --> 14:47.257
He's a professional
first and foremost.

14:47.325 --> 14:49.159
He'll handle it.

14:49.227 --> 14:50.805
Uh, think we're about
to test that theory.

14:50.829 --> 14:52.709
We got something you guys
are gonna want to see.

14:54.800 --> 14:57.066
So we've been digging
into Nick's time

14:57.068 --> 14:58.902
with the drug interdiction
task force.

14:58.904 --> 15:01.337
He was analyzing Intel
on smuggling routes.

15:01.339 --> 15:03.406
SEBASTIAN: Yeah, and since he
joined the Coast Guard,

15:03.408 --> 15:04.707
narcotics busts are down 20%.

15:04.709 --> 15:06.709
It's hard to believe
that's a coincidence.

15:06.711 --> 15:09.179
It's Occam's razor. The simplest
explanation is usually correct.

15:09.181 --> 15:10.747
Well, the simplest
explanation here

15:10.749 --> 15:12.882
is that he was feeding Intel
to drug traffickers,

15:12.884 --> 15:14.984
trying to help avoid
Coast Guard patrols.

15:14.986 --> 15:17.086
That's just not true.

15:17.088 --> 15:19.622
Look, I know it's not
what you want to hear, Patton.

15:19.624 --> 15:21.090
Nick is no spy.

15:21.092 --> 15:23.059
The evidence tells
a different story, P.

15:23.061 --> 15:24.294
He was being used.

15:24.296 --> 15:25.628
How can you be sure?

15:25.630 --> 15:27.130
I can prove it.

15:27.132 --> 15:28.932
The device we found on Nick's
leg was temporary storage.

15:28.934 --> 15:32.268
Whatever data it was
collecting had to be off-loaded

15:32.270 --> 15:34.170
using an encrypted
wireless signal.

15:34.172 --> 15:34.935
And you decrypted it?

15:34.959 --> 15:36.748
It wasn't easy, but
I backtraced it.

15:39.445 --> 15:41.311
Crane Rehab Center?

15:41.379 --> 15:42.545
There's another device there.

15:42.614 --> 15:44.447
It's emitting the same signal.

15:44.516 --> 15:46.127
Now, all we have to do
to clear Nick's name

15:46.151 --> 15:47.817
is find out who has it.

15:47.886 --> 15:51.054
All right, Gregorio, grab
Lasalle, get back down there.

15:51.122 --> 15:52.300
- I'll drive.
GREGORIO: P, we got this.

15:52.324 --> 15:54.724
Nuh-uh, no.
I'm not staying here.

15:54.793 --> 15:56.893
And besides, I have
the frequency tracker

15:56.962 --> 15:58.394
we need to find the signal.

15:58.463 --> 16:00.663
I know you're looking out
for your friend...

16:00.732 --> 16:02.298
That man is not just my friend.

16:03.869 --> 16:06.102
He was there for me
at the lowest point of my life.

16:06.171 --> 16:09.973
After my accident,
that man got me through rehab.

16:10.041 --> 16:13.509
He saved me. I owe him that.

16:16.815 --> 16:18.459
Well, let's all go,
we'll make it a field trip. Come on.

16:18.483 --> 16:20.583
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Everybody can't go.

16:20.652 --> 16:22.318
Just stay here, Sebastian.

16:22.387 --> 16:24.454
Try the rest
of the interdiction team.

16:24.522 --> 16:27.123
You think you can keep
an open mind about Taylor?

16:27.192 --> 16:28.258
Course I can, Pride.

16:32.063 --> 16:33.830
Let's do this.

16:39.437 --> 16:41.871
What exactly are
we looking for up in here?

16:41.940 --> 16:44.340
Could be another device like
the one found in Nick's leg.

16:44.409 --> 16:46.020
Meaning it's planted
in another prosthetic?

16:46.044 --> 16:47.377
Could be.

16:47.445 --> 16:48.845
LASALLE:
Signal's getting stronger.

16:48.914 --> 16:50.613
Means we're closer.

16:50.682 --> 16:53.149
Is it supposed
to make that sound?

16:53.218 --> 16:55.151
Something's telling me
that's a big fat no.

16:55.220 --> 16:57.120
Means there's multiple devices.

16:57.188 --> 16:59.289
And they're all
in the same room.

17:00.458 --> 17:02.292
Multiple devices...

17:02.360 --> 17:05.361
Multiple spies.

17:05.430 --> 17:07.230
SIMMS: While members
of the Valor Brigade

17:07.299 --> 17:08.897
are not law enforcement agents,

17:08.967 --> 17:11.401
you are held to the same
standards of protocol.

17:11.469 --> 17:13.269
(device pinging)

17:13.338 --> 17:15.637
You're late. You can get notes
from somebody else.

17:15.707 --> 17:18.141
I'm not going back.
I'm not here for training.

17:18.209 --> 17:21.044
LASALLE: We're NCIS.
- Oh, yeah, I remember.

17:21.112 --> 17:22.578
You interrupted
my PT this morning,

17:22.646 --> 17:24.180
and now you're interrupting
my lecture.

17:24.249 --> 17:26.915
Which one of them
do you want to see now?

17:26.984 --> 17:29.852
Honestly? Everybody.

17:31.556 --> 17:33.756
Including you.

17:36.428 --> 17:40.029
So, Detective Simms,
how long have you been injured?

17:40.098 --> 17:42.198
Six months.

17:42.267 --> 17:44.100
I was pursuing
a fugitive on foot

17:44.169 --> 17:47.337
when a car swerved out
of the way to avoid him, hit me.

17:47.405 --> 17:49.706
Lost my leg, bruised
my spinal cord.

17:49.774 --> 17:52.342
Oh, yeah,
and the suspect got away.

17:52.410 --> 17:53.743
Where did you get
your equipment?

17:53.812 --> 17:56.012
Rehab. Chair's just a loaner.

17:56.081 --> 17:58.348
I'll be on my feet again
soon enough.

17:58.416 --> 17:59.593
The doctors say
that's a possibility?

17:59.617 --> 18:01.884
Doctors don't know everything.

18:01.953 --> 18:03.720
The connection's
still there, just...

18:03.788 --> 18:06.055
waiting for the
swelling to go down.

18:06.124 --> 18:08.291
But you guys
didn't call me in here

18:08.360 --> 18:10.460
to talk about my injury, so...

18:10.495 --> 18:13.563
No, we're here to
talk about these.

18:17.102 --> 18:19.235
Don't even know what those are.

18:19.304 --> 18:21.437
Keyboard sniffers.

18:21.506 --> 18:23.873
Track and record
computer keystrokes

18:23.942 --> 18:25.975
within a 50-foot radius.

18:26.044 --> 18:27.810
(chuckles):
I'm a street cop.

18:27.879 --> 18:30.046
I kick down doors
and I kick ass.

18:30.115 --> 18:32.615
I don't do tech.

18:32.684 --> 18:34.384
They're advanced bugs
for hacking.

18:34.452 --> 18:37.487
One of these was found
on Nick Taylor's prosthesis.

18:37.555 --> 18:40.490
- Hmm.
- Think he was killed over it.

18:40.558 --> 18:42.558
Sounds like he was
up to no good.

18:42.627 --> 18:43.827
One of these was found on each

18:43.895 --> 18:45.172
of the members
of the Valor Brigade

18:45.196 --> 18:46.329
that you were
lecturing.

18:46.398 --> 18:47.930
I'm not in the Valor Brigade.

18:47.999 --> 18:49.665
I provide
training on behalf

18:49.734 --> 18:50.833
of the NOPD.

18:50.902 --> 18:52.835
I'm an actual cop.

18:52.904 --> 18:55.264
Well, then, you should know
what we're getting at with this.

18:58.543 --> 19:00.476
We found this one...

19:02.380 --> 19:03.946
...on your chair.

19:05.216 --> 19:07.016
That's not possible.

19:07.085 --> 19:09.285
Oh, it's more than possible,
Detective, it's a fact.

19:09.354 --> 19:11.254
Only question is,
did you know you were stealing

19:11.322 --> 19:14.290
confidential police information,
or were you being used?

19:14.359 --> 19:17.994
In 15 years of police work,
I've had a spotless record.

19:18.063 --> 19:20.596
Now, you can search my home,
search my bank accounts,

19:20.665 --> 19:23.032
whatever the hell you want.

19:23.101 --> 19:25.868
Someone's played me for a fool.

19:29.541 --> 19:32.308
These bugs were being
used to steal Intel

19:32.377 --> 19:34.177
from multiple
law enforcement agencies.

19:34.245 --> 19:38.614
Yeah, Navy, Coast Guard,
DEA, FBI, NOPD.

19:38.683 --> 19:40.494
Well, Pride's gonna head back
to Belle Chasse to liaise

19:40.518 --> 19:43.319
with the agencies, try to figure
out the damage that was done.

19:43.388 --> 19:45.733
Well, this has been going on for
months. It's, it's gonna be bad.

19:45.757 --> 19:47.523
And we don't have a
viable suspect yet.

19:47.592 --> 19:49.492
Yeah, all the members
of the Valor Brigade

19:49.561 --> 19:50.938
claim to have no
idea about the bugs.

19:50.962 --> 19:52.406
LASALLE: Yeah. Looked into
their backgrounds,

19:52.430 --> 19:54.697
and they're all
upstanding veterans

19:54.766 --> 19:56.732
dedicated to service,
even after sustaining

19:56.801 --> 19:58.568
such traumatic injuries.

19:58.636 --> 20:00.448
Is Gregorio escorting them
back to the Crane Center?

20:00.472 --> 20:02.371
Yeah, with our thanks
for their cooperation.

20:02.440 --> 20:04.340
What about Simms? He involved?

20:04.409 --> 20:07.043
He says no. I'm inclined
to believe him. It's conceivable

20:07.112 --> 20:08.722
they were being used.
All right, which means

20:08.746 --> 20:10.980
it's possible Nick Taylor
was being used, too.

20:11.049 --> 20:12.293
PATTON: That's what
I've been trying

20:12.317 --> 20:14.350
to tell you. Nick is no spy.

20:14.419 --> 20:15.499
You might be right, Patton,

20:15.553 --> 20:16.897
but we still don't have
a viable suspect.

20:16.921 --> 20:18.721
Hell yes, we do.

20:20.325 --> 20:22.525
Julia Flores? Taylor's
physical therapist?

20:22.594 --> 20:23.993
And secret
girlfriend, right?

20:24.062 --> 20:26.095
She may not be a member
of the Valor Brigade,

20:26.164 --> 20:27.419
but she had access
to all their equipment.

20:27.420 --> 20:29.765
I guess it's possible she
could have placed the devices

20:29.834 --> 20:31.567
without anyone knowing.
- But why?

20:31.636 --> 20:34.070
She was being coerced.

20:34.139 --> 20:35.705
I dumped her cell phone.

20:35.773 --> 20:37.673
I found multiple texts
from an unknown number.

20:37.742 --> 20:40.143
Seems like someone found out
about her and Nick.

20:40.178 --> 20:42.512
So, okay, wait.
So we're saying that this woman

20:42.580 --> 20:44.914
committed treason just to keep
her relationship a secret?

20:44.949 --> 20:47.416
Not only that.
The blackmailer threatened her

20:47.485 --> 20:50.286
with physical violence
if Julia didn't agree to help.

20:50.355 --> 20:52.455
So, what? Her boyfriend, Taylor,

20:52.524 --> 20:54.390
finds out and confronts her?

20:54.459 --> 20:56.299
Nick was desperate
to speak with me that night.

20:56.361 --> 20:57.927
It was probably about this.

20:59.430 --> 21:03.032
Is Julia Flores the type
to pull off a drive-by shooting?

21:03.101 --> 21:04.800
There's only one way
to find out.

21:04.869 --> 21:06.402
Let's go bring her in.

21:11.709 --> 21:13.543
Landlady next door said

21:13.611 --> 21:15.111
Julia came home early

21:15.180 --> 21:17.813
and hasn't left since.
- All right.

21:19.984 --> 21:22.552
(exhales) I do
the cop knock?

21:24.289 --> 21:25.621
Julia Flores.

21:25.690 --> 21:27.723
Federal agents.

21:29.294 --> 21:31.127
- Use the key?
- Yeah.

21:31.196 --> 21:33.063
All right, Ms. Flores.
We're coming in.

21:38.503 --> 21:40.437
SEBASTIAN:
This doesn't look good.

21:54.486 --> 21:56.019
LASALLE:
She's not in here.

21:56.088 --> 21:58.488
(exhales)
Stop playing hide-and-seek.

21:58.557 --> 21:59.989
I found her.

22:02.761 --> 22:03.960
(inhales sharply)

22:04.029 --> 22:05.662
Looks like
they got to her first.

22:15.427 --> 22:17.894
Lasalle's with Sebastian
in Julia Flores' apartment

22:17.963 --> 22:19.941
looking for any evidence
that'll point to her killer.

22:19.965 --> 22:22.132
Well, we can assume the suspect
is responsible

22:22.201 --> 22:23.867
for Nick Taylor's
murder as well.

22:23.936 --> 22:26.370
And all because she was bugging
members of the Valor Brigade

22:26.438 --> 22:28.805
in order to steal Intel
from law enforcement.

22:28.874 --> 22:31.141
Well, clearly,
she has an accomplice.

22:31.210 --> 22:32.542
There's no sign
of forced entry

22:32.611 --> 22:34.411
It's likely she
knew her killer.

22:34.480 --> 22:35.946
No sign of stolen Intel, either.

22:36.014 --> 22:38.982
Julia Flores'
digital devices are clean.

22:39.051 --> 22:40.884
No telling how much
confidential information

22:40.953 --> 22:42.386
has been sold off.

22:42.454 --> 22:45.489
Undercover operations,
names of informants,

22:45.557 --> 22:47.591
policing strategies, I...

22:47.659 --> 22:48.870
Yeah, well, I spent
all evening at Belle Chase

22:48.894 --> 22:51.061
trying to sort this all out.

22:51.130 --> 22:54.064
It's a mess for every agency
utilizing the Valor Brigade.

22:54.133 --> 22:55.999
And a mess for
veterans involved.

22:56.068 --> 22:57.567
It's a genius plan,
actually.

22:57.636 --> 22:59.669
Using disabled veterans
as spies.

23:01.140 --> 23:03.073
Disabled people are everywhere.

23:03.142 --> 23:06.076
But society trains people
to look right through us.

23:06.145 --> 23:07.944
If they look at us at all.

23:08.013 --> 23:10.147
(scoffs)
We hide in plain sight.

23:10.215 --> 23:11.581
I never thought
of it that way.

23:11.650 --> 23:13.850
(laughs) My point exactly.

23:13.919 --> 23:15.752
Fair enough.

23:15.821 --> 23:17.821
Does this get us any closer
to our suspect?

23:17.890 --> 23:20.590
Yeah, we need to figure out
who benefits.

23:20.659 --> 23:22.699
That's one of the many reasons
you keep me employed.

23:24.830 --> 23:27.531
I was able to recover
every piece of data

23:27.599 --> 23:30.500
recorded on those
confiscated devices

23:30.569 --> 23:32.669
in the last six months.

23:32.738 --> 23:34.337
Now all I got to do
is cross-reference

23:34.406 --> 23:35.839
the data with the bad guys,

23:35.908 --> 23:37.641
and see who got away
with more crimes.

23:37.709 --> 23:38.989
Do you got
some sort of algorithm

23:39.044 --> 23:40.177
that could help us do this?

23:40.245 --> 23:41.745
Huh. No, ma'am.

23:41.814 --> 23:43.980
This gonna take some
old-fashioned grunt work.

23:44.049 --> 23:46.716
It'll take us weeks
to go through this Intel.

23:46.785 --> 23:48.318
That's time we don't have
with all this

23:48.420 --> 23:49.798
sensitive information
floating around.

23:49.822 --> 23:52.055
Yeah, but it's our best chance
at finding a suspect.

23:52.124 --> 23:54.291
Think I got a better solution.

23:58.096 --> 23:59.963
I remember visiting you

24:00.032 --> 24:01.832
at a place like this
100 years ago.

24:01.900 --> 24:03.633
Yeah, I remember
you breaking me out,

24:03.702 --> 24:06.036
taking me to the Saints game.
- Needed to cheer you up.

24:06.104 --> 24:08.672
Yeah. Nurses weren't
too happy about that.

24:08.740 --> 24:10.807
Yeah, they complained
to my supervisor.

24:10.876 --> 24:13.043
Almost got me suspended.

24:13.111 --> 24:14.644
Hey, man, I covered your ass.

24:14.713 --> 24:16.546
Yeah, by telling everyone

24:16.615 --> 24:18.715
that you walked
out of there on your own,

24:18.784 --> 24:20.584
ran into me
at the Superdome.

24:20.652 --> 24:22.886
That's my story and
I'm sticking to it.

24:22.955 --> 24:24.654
That was
a good game, though.

24:24.723 --> 24:26.022
For the first time,

24:26.091 --> 24:28.058
I was able to forget
about all my troubles.

24:28.126 --> 24:29.759
Man, I was so angry.

24:29.828 --> 24:31.661
Marriage falling apart.

24:31.730 --> 24:33.408
Nick kept it real about
my injuries, though.

24:33.432 --> 24:34.931
You kept my spirits up.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.033
That's what family's for.
Hey, man.

24:37.102 --> 24:39.936
Not everybody's lucky to
have support like that.

24:40.005 --> 24:42.372
Time like that, you find
out who your friends are.

24:44.943 --> 24:48.512
Oh, you guys are really
ruining my week, here.

24:48.580 --> 24:50.780
If you're gonna arrest us,
just do it already.

24:50.849 --> 24:52.215
I was told NCIS

24:52.284 --> 24:53.617
cleared us
of any wrongdoing.

24:53.685 --> 24:54.885
That's right.

24:54.953 --> 24:56.786
No one's in any trouble.

24:56.855 --> 24:58.455
No one's getting arrested.

24:58.524 --> 24:59.723
Well, then,
what's this about?

24:59.825 --> 25:01.725
Nick Taylor and Julia Flores.

25:01.793 --> 25:05.195
Both murdered by someone
stealing Intel.

25:05.264 --> 25:06.530
Got any leads?

25:06.598 --> 25:08.265
Not yet.
That's where you come in.

25:09.535 --> 25:11.201
We need to look through
all the data

25:11.270 --> 25:13.103
stolen from your agencies.

25:13.171 --> 25:15.438
Any connection to Julia
or criminals

25:15.507 --> 25:17.073
who benefited the most.

25:17.142 --> 25:19.643
It requires more eyes
than what we've got.

25:19.711 --> 25:22.479
We need trained professionals
that know what to look for.

25:22.548 --> 25:24.648
That's all of you.

25:24.716 --> 25:26.149
If you're up for it.

25:28.287 --> 25:30.453
We're in.

25:30.522 --> 25:33.790
Nah, it's a hard
pass for me.

25:33.859 --> 25:35.470
PRIDE: You're the most experienced
person in here.

25:35.494 --> 25:37.160
We need you.

25:37.229 --> 25:38.795
And I need to focus on recovery.

25:38.864 --> 25:40.830
I'm gonna go to the gym.

25:40.899 --> 25:42.999
Y'all have fun, though.

25:47.739 --> 25:50.307
- Simms, hold up.
- No time.

25:50.375 --> 25:52.309
Busy, have a nice life.

25:54.513 --> 25:56.146
What? What do you want?

25:56.214 --> 25:57.647
To give you
a reality check.

25:57.716 --> 25:59.449
Oh, I-I get it.

25:59.518 --> 26:00.951
This is where
you relate to me

26:01.019 --> 26:02.452
and give me
some tough love?

26:02.521 --> 26:03.954
Nah, I'll smack
some sense into you

26:04.022 --> 26:06.289
if you don't show me
some respect.

26:06.358 --> 26:08.458
All right.

26:08.527 --> 26:10.360
Speak.

26:10.429 --> 26:11.928
Look, man.

26:11.997 --> 26:14.030
Your leg is not
gonna magically grow back.

26:14.099 --> 26:15.599
Here goes.

26:15.667 --> 26:17.145
You're not just gonna
get out that chair--

26:17.169 --> 26:18.802
at least not today, anyway.

26:18.870 --> 26:21.538
Your motivational speaking
could really use some work.

26:21.607 --> 26:23.206
You could skip the workout.

26:23.275 --> 26:25.609
I need you to focus on
something other than yourself.

26:25.677 --> 26:27.510
I need you to help me
find Nick's killer, man.

26:27.579 --> 26:30.113
Look, I am sorry for your loss,
but I did not know the guy.

26:30.182 --> 26:32.315
You knew the guy
better than most.

26:32.384 --> 26:33.817
You shared something in common.

26:33.885 --> 26:37.120
No. I am not like Taylor or you.

26:38.757 --> 26:40.690
All right? This chair isn't me.

26:40.792 --> 26:43.326
This is only a temporary
state of affairs.

26:43.395 --> 26:45.128
Okay, situation's temporary.

26:45.197 --> 26:47.831
You'll get up and walk.
It doesn't matter right now.

26:47.899 --> 26:49.566
And what matters, then?

26:50.702 --> 26:52.802
The suspects we're trying
to find.

26:52.871 --> 26:54.137
They used you.

26:55.440 --> 26:57.807
They saw you as weak, broken.

26:57.876 --> 26:59.576
An easy target.

26:59.645 --> 27:02.012
Don't you want
to prove them wrong?

27:06.918 --> 27:09.653
Well, I just finished
analyzing the evidence

27:09.721 --> 27:11.187
from Julia Flores's apartment.

27:11.256 --> 27:13.456
Well, I just completed
her autopsy.

27:13.492 --> 27:17.193
I managed to extract a bullet
in near-pristine condition.

27:17.262 --> 27:19.262
Same caliber as the ones
that killed Taylor.

27:19.331 --> 27:20.764
All right, I'll
run ballistics.

27:20.832 --> 27:22.332
Maybe we'll be lucky, get a hit.

27:22.401 --> 27:24.401
We could use some luck here.
There's no foreign DNA

27:24.436 --> 27:25.902
under Ms. Flores's
fingernails,

27:25.971 --> 27:27.537
no signs of a struggle.

27:27.606 --> 27:29.539
Not much to offer
in identifying her killer.

27:29.608 --> 27:32.509
Yeah, well, I might've found
something at the crime scene.

27:32.577 --> 27:34.544
Scuff marks on the floor...

27:34.613 --> 27:36.012
in the hallway.

27:36.081 --> 27:37.681
Like heels of a shoe?

27:37.749 --> 27:39.349
Maybe, but
what matters is

27:39.418 --> 27:41.095
the particles that I found
in the scuff marks.

27:41.119 --> 27:42.919
It's high-grade cocaine.

27:42.988 --> 27:44.788
No, Ms. Flores's tox screen
came back clean.

27:44.856 --> 27:46.790
Yeah, well, this
stuff is 100% pure.

27:46.858 --> 27:48.224
It's not meant
for consumption.

27:48.293 --> 27:49.859
Plus, I only found
traces of it anyway.

27:49.928 --> 27:52.929
So... it came from the suspect.
Yeah, if I can track

27:52.998 --> 27:54.297
where the cocaine came from,

27:54.366 --> 27:56.299
should be able to find
the killer.

28:01.940 --> 28:04.374
Uh, I don't know
how you do this.

28:04.443 --> 28:06.142
Sitting in this hole,

28:06.211 --> 28:08.478
eyeballing a screen
for hours at a time...

28:08.547 --> 28:10.880
Excuse me, but my office
is not a hole.

28:10.949 --> 28:12.449
I should be out on the street.

28:12.517 --> 28:13.983
Kicking ass
and taking names, right?

28:14.052 --> 28:16.586
- Exactly.
- That's not how cases are solved.

28:16.655 --> 28:18.788
It's how arrests are made.
Because of the work

28:18.857 --> 28:21.157
done in tastefully decorated
rooms like these.

28:21.226 --> 28:22.425
We've been at this for hours.

28:22.494 --> 28:24.439
All right? Along with the rest
of the Valor Brigade.

28:24.463 --> 28:25.829
And what do we have
to show for it?

28:25.897 --> 28:28.231
Do you bring this
attitude to rehab?

28:28.300 --> 28:29.966
I bring this attitude
to everything I do.

28:30.035 --> 28:32.302
Anger and frustration
have always served me well.

28:32.370 --> 28:33.803
Well, it's time
to add some faith.

28:33.872 --> 28:35.550
'Cause we just narrowed
the pool of suspects

28:35.574 --> 28:37.841
from 20 criminal organizations
to five.

28:37.909 --> 28:39.943
Yeah, five gangs
with the most to gain

28:40.011 --> 28:42.412
from stealing
this information and Intel?

28:42.481 --> 28:43.947
With 100 members?

28:44.015 --> 28:46.483
That's still not much to go on.

28:46.551 --> 28:48.651
Hey, any of these
gangs traffic

28:48.720 --> 28:51.254
high-grade cocaine from the
Apurimac Valley in Peru?

28:51.323 --> 28:53.823
They all have
some involvement in drugs.

28:53.892 --> 28:55.636
Well, according to Sebastian,
these narcotics

28:55.660 --> 28:57.260
are pretty damn special.

28:57.329 --> 28:58.695
Okay, well, we'll keep
an eye out

28:58.764 --> 29:00.664
for the Peruvian marching powder
in our search.

29:00.665 --> 29:01.531
SIMMS:
No, no, no.

29:01.600 --> 29:03.933
W-We don't have to.
Listen.

29:04.002 --> 29:06.803
Before my accident, I was
assigned to narcotics.

29:06.872 --> 29:09.005
And there was this
new player in town that was

29:09.074 --> 29:12.142
flooding the streets
with this highly potent cocaine.

29:12.244 --> 29:14.088
Well, don't keep us in suspense.
Who's the player?

29:14.112 --> 29:16.880
The Marauders.

29:16.948 --> 29:18.281
Who are the Marauders?

29:18.350 --> 29:19.649
Motorcycle gang on

29:19.718 --> 29:21.518
the margins of the
smuggling business.

29:21.586 --> 29:23.052
Guns, pot, cigarettes.

29:23.121 --> 29:25.321
They managed to luck into
a Peruvian connection

29:25.390 --> 29:27.991
for cocaine;
became big players overnight.

29:28.059 --> 29:29.692
How come I haven't
heard of them?

29:29.761 --> 29:31.161
NOPD was handling them
for a while,

29:31.229 --> 29:33.007
but then they got smart.
Managed to avoid arrests.

29:33.031 --> 29:34.731
Yeah, as if they had
inside information.

29:34.800 --> 29:36.699
How does this gang

29:36.768 --> 29:39.669
connect to Julia Flores
or Nick Taylor?

29:39.738 --> 29:41.371
We cross-referenced them

29:41.439 --> 29:43.673
with each of these names
in this gang, we got nothing.

29:43.742 --> 29:45.219
Well, then, we need
to cast a wider net.

29:45.243 --> 29:48.645
Flores, Taylor...
the Valor Brigade.

29:48.713 --> 29:51.247
They're all involved. What's
the common denominator here?

29:51.316 --> 29:53.149
Crane Rehab Center.

29:54.619 --> 29:56.519
Any Marauders connection there?

29:56.588 --> 29:58.021
I got something.

29:59.758 --> 30:01.858
Motorcycle accident.
Captain of the Marauders

30:01.927 --> 30:04.527
was involved,
walked away unhurt.

30:06.097 --> 30:07.864
Different story for his brother.

30:09.568 --> 30:11.167
You got to be kidding me.

30:11.236 --> 30:13.002
Zander Reed.

30:13.071 --> 30:14.537
Met him at the center yesterday.

30:14.606 --> 30:16.272
Patton, you were right.

30:17.576 --> 30:19.676
He was hiding in plain sight.

30:29.630 --> 30:33.538
Reed lost a leg a year ago in
an unsanctioned motorcycle race,

30:33.539 --> 30:35.506
ends up at the Crane Center
for rehab.

30:35.575 --> 30:36.775
LASALLE:
Few months after that,

30:36.843 --> 30:38.354
the Marauders' business
started booming.

30:38.378 --> 30:40.644
Avoiding arrests and
gaining strength on the street.

30:40.713 --> 30:42.391
'Cause they're probably getting
information fed to them

30:42.415 --> 30:43.981
from the Valor Brigade.

30:44.050 --> 30:46.083
How's a guy like Reed
get the technical know-how

30:46.152 --> 30:48.030
to run a scheme like this?
LASALLE: Two semesters

30:48.054 --> 30:50.421
of computer science
at a technical college.

30:50.490 --> 30:51.667
PRIDE: So what are
we thinking here?

30:51.691 --> 30:54.792
That Reed somehow
gets Julia Flores

30:54.861 --> 30:57.094
to plant the bugs
in the prosthetics and chairs?

30:57.163 --> 30:58.562
HANNAH:
Blackmails her

30:58.631 --> 31:00.075
'cause of an inappropriate
relationship she was having

31:00.099 --> 31:01.532
with a patient, Nick Taylor.

31:01.601 --> 31:05.169
Then Taylor somehow figures out
what she's been doing,

31:05.238 --> 31:07.271
wants to expose the scheme.

31:07.340 --> 31:09.707
Reed kills him,
then kills Flores

31:09.776 --> 31:12.143
when he sees NCIS
is on the case.

31:12.211 --> 31:14.645
He was right under our nose
and we didn't even know it.

31:14.714 --> 31:18.516
No one knew.
Key now is to bring him in.

31:18.584 --> 31:20.785
Yeah, well, we got to find him
first. Guy's in the wind.

31:20.853 --> 31:23.020
He could be laying low
with the Marauders.

31:23.089 --> 31:24.789
Except they're not laying low.

31:24.857 --> 31:25.990
You learn something, P?

31:26.059 --> 31:28.793
Not me. Come on.

31:28.861 --> 31:30.461
Keep at it.
All right.

31:31.597 --> 31:34.365
I still got a few CIs
who'll take my call

31:34.434 --> 31:37.401
and I rattled their cages
to get info on the Marauders.

31:37.470 --> 31:38.910
They're making a move
this afternoon.

31:38.971 --> 31:40.204
PATTON:
Meeting a boat at the

31:40.273 --> 31:42.306
Poland Street Wharf,
some kind of drug shipment.

31:42.375 --> 31:43.741
You think Reed'll be with them?

31:43.810 --> 31:45.687
What I hear, Marauders
are gonna put him on a boat

31:45.711 --> 31:46.844
and out of the country.

31:46.913 --> 31:48.624
Not if we get to
the Poland Street Wharf first.

31:48.648 --> 31:49.847
I'll get the team geared up.

31:49.916 --> 31:51.849
Yeah. This is good work.

31:51.918 --> 31:53.117
Glad I could contribute.

31:53.186 --> 31:55.886
Hey, like I said, this
is where cases get solved.

31:55.955 --> 31:57.488
I'd still like to go with you,

31:57.557 --> 31:59.757
look Reed in the eyes
when the cuffs go on.

31:59.826 --> 32:01.906
You'll get your chance
soon as we have him back here.

32:01.961 --> 32:04.095
Fair enough.
Oh, hey, hey.

32:04.163 --> 32:06.030
Marauders roll pretty heavy.

32:06.099 --> 32:08.265
We'll be careful.

32:08.334 --> 32:10.201
PATTON: Hey, Kev,
we can monitor

32:10.269 --> 32:12.536
the takedown from here
if you just want to hang around.

32:12.605 --> 32:14.038
Be like the eyes in the sky.

32:14.107 --> 32:16.207
Nah, I'm beat.

32:16.275 --> 32:17.875
All this thinking
and typing

32:17.944 --> 32:20.111
wore me out. I think
I'm just gonna head home.

32:20.179 --> 32:22.880
You sure? We're about
to catch the bad guys.

32:22.949 --> 32:24.181
This is the best part.

32:24.250 --> 32:26.851
You just let me know
when you get Reed.

32:35.094 --> 32:36.794
Not a lot of
places to hide.

32:36.863 --> 32:38.195
Let's split up.

32:38.264 --> 32:39.663
Sebastian and I'll
go around back.

32:39.732 --> 32:42.266
Eyes peeled. Marauders
could be anywhere.

32:42.335 --> 32:43.968
All right?
And they're heavily armed.

32:44.036 --> 32:46.036
Let's move.
Comms open.

32:59.385 --> 33:01.130
PRIDE (over comms):
Sebastian, Lasalle, just spotted

33:01.154 --> 33:02.453
three Marauders at the dock.

33:02.522 --> 33:04.221
What's your status?

33:04.290 --> 33:06.891
I got a visual on the
truck and five bikes.

33:06.959 --> 33:08.125
At least
three bikers.

33:08.194 --> 33:09.760
PRIDE: All right, copy that.
Let's move.

33:26.812 --> 33:28.946
(indistinct chatter)

33:33.586 --> 33:34.752
On my count.

33:36.222 --> 33:38.589
Three... two... one.

33:43.496 --> 33:44.929
HANNAH:
Federal agents!

33:44.997 --> 33:46.597
(gunfire)

34:14.793 --> 34:16.793
(over bullhorn):
This is the Coast Guard.

34:16.862 --> 34:18.062
Put your weapons down.

34:18.130 --> 34:20.030
Get down on the ground...
Put it down!

34:20.099 --> 34:21.099
Get on the ground!

34:21.132 --> 34:22.444
(over bullhorn):
...we can see them.

34:22.467 --> 34:23.500
Do it now.

34:23.569 --> 34:25.969
(siren wailing)

34:26.038 --> 34:27.371
On your feet.

34:32.911 --> 34:34.844
Where's Reed?

34:36.382 --> 34:39.850
He isn't here.

34:50.830 --> 34:52.329
I'd have bought you a drink,

34:52.398 --> 34:54.531
but I see you ain't finished
the one you got.

34:54.600 --> 34:55.933
The hell are you doing here?

34:56.002 --> 34:57.167
Obviously following you.

34:57.236 --> 34:58.869
What's your excuse?

34:58.938 --> 35:00.738
Just unwinding.

35:00.806 --> 35:03.841
You drove a hell
of a long way to unwind.

35:03.909 --> 35:05.754
Aren't there any crappy bars
in your neighborhood?

35:05.778 --> 35:07.378
Just because we spent
the day together

35:07.446 --> 35:09.580
does not mean
we're going steady.

35:09.649 --> 35:12.149
And I thought we were
getting along so well.

35:12.184 --> 35:15.853
For real, Patton, you got to go.

35:15.921 --> 35:18.122
Who you giving
evil eyes to?

35:20.326 --> 35:21.759
SIMMS:
Zander Reed.

35:23.529 --> 35:27.731
You sent NCIS to the wharf, and
you knew Reed wouldn't be there.

35:27.800 --> 35:30.567
It's a good bust. Your team will
get kudos, but Reed is mine.

35:30.636 --> 35:33.237
Do you realize
your brain and your legs

35:33.306 --> 35:35.105
aren't on speaking terms
right now?

35:35.174 --> 35:37.141
All I need is a confession.

35:37.209 --> 35:39.743
I have ways of encouraging him
to open up.

35:41.480 --> 35:43.358
You didn't think this thing
all the way through.

35:43.382 --> 35:45.549
It's all I've
been thinking about.

35:45.618 --> 35:48.919
Look, hold your roll, man. Let's
go outside and talk about this.

35:51.624 --> 35:53.290
Simms.
(grunts)

35:54.360 --> 35:55.726
Zander Reed?

35:58.898 --> 36:00.597
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa, hold up.

36:02.668 --> 36:03.934
No need for weapons.

36:04.003 --> 36:05.636
I'm just a computer specialist.

36:05.705 --> 36:07.571
I'm not.

36:18.952 --> 36:22.086
All right, look, this is
all fun and everything,

36:22.155 --> 36:24.055
but can we just use
our words right now?

36:24.123 --> 36:25.723
Shoot the chatty one first.

36:25.792 --> 36:26.991
Try it. See what happens.

36:27.060 --> 36:29.026
Don't try it.

36:29.095 --> 36:31.729
What are you even doing here?
Arresting you for murder.

36:31.798 --> 36:34.665
This seem like a good time
to be a smart-ass?

36:34.734 --> 36:36.200
He can't help himself. Trust me.

36:36.269 --> 36:38.436
You killed Nick Taylor
and Julia Flores

36:38.538 --> 36:40.171
and played the Valor Brigade
for fools.

36:41.674 --> 36:43.741
You are fools.

36:43.743 --> 36:45.443
And Taylor was
the biggest one,

36:45.445 --> 36:46.677
should've stayed in his lane.

36:46.679 --> 36:49.213
Whoa, you talking
about my friend, partner.

36:49.215 --> 36:51.015
And what're you gonna
do about it?

36:51.017 --> 36:52.116
Put a bullet between your eyes.

36:52.118 --> 36:54.318
If you were gonna shoot me,
I'd be shot.

36:54.320 --> 36:55.987
Don't test fate, son.

36:55.989 --> 36:59.457
You feel sorry for yourself.

36:59.459 --> 37:00.825
I don't.

37:00.827 --> 37:02.760
We were both dealt
a bad hand.

37:02.762 --> 37:04.895
You're just pissed 'cause
I figured out a way to make

37:04.897 --> 37:06.197
a profit from it.

37:06.199 --> 37:07.431
Enough talking.

37:07.433 --> 37:10.268
Simms, don't let him define you.

37:10.270 --> 37:11.936
You are not like him.

37:11.938 --> 37:13.437
Come on, man,
you do this...

37:14.140 --> 37:16.540
...you gonna ruin your life,

37:16.542 --> 37:18.376
if you're even breathing
after this.

37:18.378 --> 37:20.278
You're the one with the life.
I got nothing.

37:20.280 --> 37:21.345
Then do this already.

37:21.347 --> 37:22.680
Yo, would you shut up?

37:22.682 --> 37:25.116
And I need you to listen to me.

37:25.118 --> 37:28.119
Simms, if you want what I got,

37:28.121 --> 37:30.221
you gonna have to accept
your new reality.

37:30.223 --> 37:31.522
It's gonna be

37:31.524 --> 37:32.723
the hardest thing you ever do,

37:32.725 --> 37:34.025
but it's the only way.

37:34.027 --> 37:35.159
And live in your fantasyland?

37:35.161 --> 37:36.927
No, thanks.

37:36.929 --> 37:39.463
You think I don't miss feeling
the ground beneath my feet?

37:39.465 --> 37:42.333
And I still got to wake up
every day and live my life.

37:42.335 --> 37:44.935
Come on, he got
a few screws loose,

37:44.937 --> 37:46.937
but he makes a valid point.

37:46.939 --> 37:48.272
What's that?

37:48.274 --> 37:51.242
You got to make something useful
of your situation.

37:51.244 --> 37:53.978
Come on, man, let me be to you
what Nick was to me.

37:53.980 --> 37:56.080
REED: What does
it matter? You're both

37:56.082 --> 37:57.748
gonna die today anyway.

37:59.185 --> 38:02.520
REED: What does
Ain't nobody gonna die today.Th

38:02.588 --> 38:04.955
And how can you be
so sure of that?

38:05.024 --> 38:08.092
'Cause I was stalling, jackass.

38:08.161 --> 38:10.294
Federal agents!
Get your hands up.

38:10.363 --> 38:12.863
LASALLE: Zander Reed,
you're under arrest.

38:12.932 --> 38:15.800
Don't move.

38:15.868 --> 38:17.646
- H-H-How-how did you...
PRIDE: Patton gave us a heads-up

38:17.670 --> 38:19.270
as soon as he knew
you were here.

38:19.339 --> 38:20.749
PATTON: Dude, you could've
drove a little quicker.

38:20.773 --> 38:22.773
I was running out
of witty banter.

38:23.876 --> 38:25.009
You both okay?

38:25.078 --> 38:29.513
I don't know what I am.

38:32.685 --> 38:35.986
You a guy who just
got a second chance.

38:44.464 --> 38:47.698
Just spoke to Director Vance.

38:47.767 --> 38:49.367
I think I made
a pretty good case

38:49.435 --> 38:51.202
for the Valor Brigade
staying in business.

38:51.270 --> 38:52.970
You think the DoD
will still work with them

38:53.039 --> 38:54.739
after the
security breach?

38:54.807 --> 38:57.208
Well, considering the Valor
Brigade was also instrumental

38:57.276 --> 39:00.644
in taking down Reed
and the Marauders,

39:00.713 --> 39:03.414
yeah, I'd say they
earned their keep.

39:03.483 --> 39:05.549
Patton's earned himself
a commendation.

39:05.618 --> 39:07.351
If it wasn't for his faith
in Nick Taylor,

39:07.420 --> 39:08.664
we wouldn't have
solved this one.

39:08.688 --> 39:10.588
Got to admit, Patton's
a good field agent.

39:10.656 --> 39:12.156
Yeah, and he makes it look easy.

39:12.225 --> 39:13.969
Well, he's worked hard to get
to the place he's in now.

39:13.993 --> 39:16.927
I don't know if I could do it
if the roles were reversed.

39:16.996 --> 39:18.996
Eh, of course
you could.

39:19.065 --> 39:20.440
Patton wouldn't give you
another option.

39:20.464 --> 39:21.464
Yeah.

39:21.571 --> 39:24.038
I was gonna buy y'all a drink,
but it looks like you got stuck

39:24.106 --> 39:25.706
doing paperwork.
- Oh, yeah.

39:25.775 --> 39:27.775
Patton was gonna help,
but he had a game tonight,

39:27.844 --> 39:29.443
so we didn't want
him to miss it.

39:29.512 --> 39:31.145
Yeah, he deserves
a little R & R.

39:31.214 --> 39:32.646
You got that right.

39:34.584 --> 39:36.383
(whistle blows)

39:36.452 --> 39:38.619
(indistinct shouting)

39:47.463 --> 39:49.697
What?
(whistle blows)

39:49.765 --> 39:51.866
That wasn't a foul, man!
Come on, let us play, ref!

39:53.202 --> 39:55.703
You be tripping, brah.

39:55.771 --> 39:57.972
Hey, yo, check it out.
Yo, yo, yo.

39:58.040 --> 39:59.640
We got a new recruit.

40:01.244 --> 40:02.710
Glad you came, bruh.

40:04.113 --> 40:06.247
Taylor would be, too.

40:06.315 --> 40:08.315
Don't let these guys
go easy on me.

40:08.384 --> 40:11.919
Oh, no, believe me, I'm-a see to
it that you get your ass kicked.

40:11.988 --> 40:13.220
- Yeah?
- Welcome to the club.
