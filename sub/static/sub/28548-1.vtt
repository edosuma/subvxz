06:01.026 --> 06:04.228
By coming across
some marvelous treasure.

Or else by marrying well.

with the weight of the dragon

06:50.541 --> 06:53.344

06:53.712 --> 06:56.546
and a cloud of venom
flew before him

as he snorted and roared!

07:00.051 --> 07:01.185
But Sigurd waited

07:01.586 --> 07:04.123
till the dragon had
crawled over the pit

07:05.190 --> 07:08.592
and then he thrust his sword
under his left shoulder

07:08.594 --> 07:10.127
and right into his heart.

07:10.661 --> 07:13.762
The dragon lashed his tail
till stones broke

07:13.764 --> 07:16.301
and trees crashed about him.

07:17.668 --> 07:20.204
And then he spoke, as he died,

07:20.805 --> 07:23.709
and said, "Whoever thou art

07:24.375 --> 07:25.911
that hast slain me,

07:27.245 --> 07:29.645
this gold shall be thy ruin

16:07.864 --> 16:09.164
- And you're not?
- No.

16:09.166 --> 16:10.368
Oh, because you're special.

16:12.137 --> 16:13.472
Because I'm his son.

Christopher, darling.

17:43.126 --> 17:44.192
YOUNG CHRISTOPHER: Gilson.

17:44.194 --> 17:45.762
(WHISPERING)
Christopher, sit still.

17:45.764 --> 17:48.063
- Gilson, don't be absurd.
- Christopher. Sit down.

17:48.065 --> 17:49.666
- Stop!
- Chris, sit down.

17:49.668 --> 17:51.332
We're in a library.
Christopher, sit down.

17:51.334 --> 17:52.636
YOUNG CHRISTOPHER:
What?

17:53.136 --> 17:54.839
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

18:05.482 --> 18:07.451
We're going to take some tea.

18:07.786 --> 18:09.185
- So?
- So...

18:09.187 --> 18:11.420
I suppose as we're meant to be
doing everything together...

18:11.422 --> 18:12.822
I'll stay where I am,
thank you.

18:12.824 --> 18:13.925
Suit yourself.

18:18.896 --> 18:20.064
(SIGHS)

18:24.835 --> 18:26.070
He didn't want to come.

18:28.405 --> 18:30.041
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

18:36.514 --> 18:38.649
YOUNG GEOFFREY:
What Robert meant to say

18:38.848 --> 18:39.916
is that,

18:39.918 --> 18:42.487
with a little encouragement
from his friends,

18:43.054 --> 18:44.120
he has now acknowledged

18:44.122 --> 18:45.321
that this punishment
was his fault

18:45.323 --> 18:46.324
rather than yours,

18:46.892 --> 18:49.628
and he'd like to make amends,
by inviting you to tea.

18:50.562 --> 18:52.460
You should be flattered,
really.

18:52.462 --> 18:54.832
It was your cleverness
that rattled him.

18:55.566 --> 18:56.698
It would rattle you too

18:56.700 --> 18:58.536
if only you had
a father like Gilson.

18:58.803 --> 19:00.569
His marks
only have to drop below

19:00.571 --> 19:02.007
one other boy in the year...

19:03.040 --> 19:04.875
It's no excuse, but...

19:07.245 --> 19:08.346
Oh, come on.

19:08.645 --> 19:10.211
It's a lot more fun
than sitting around

19:10.213 --> 19:11.313
with a load of old books.

19:11.315 --> 19:12.584
I like books.

19:13.218 --> 19:14.518
So do we.

19:17.521 --> 19:19.490
Geoffrey Bache Smith.

19:20.624 --> 19:22.693
John Ronald Reuel Tolkien.

19:23.428 --> 19:24.892
YOUNG ROBERT:
Gentlemen. A thought.

19:24.894 --> 19:25.497
Tolkien.

19:26.030 --> 19:27.264
YOUNG ROBERT: Imagine walking
into Barrow's Stores,

19:27.665 --> 19:29.532
and finding me, guarding the
door with a very big stick...

19:29.534 --> 19:30.568
Where is this going?

19:30.834 --> 19:32.534
And I said, there's no need
to eat the cakes here.

19:32.536 --> 19:33.537
I've done it.

19:33.738 --> 19:35.704
In fact, I did it so much
it made me sick...

19:35.706 --> 19:37.439
That is the nature
of parental authority.

19:37.441 --> 19:39.374
"I've done it.
I've decided it was bad.

19:39.376 --> 19:40.942
And now I'm going to stop you
from doing it."

19:40.944 --> 19:42.879
- Cakes in this case being...
- Everything.

19:42.881 --> 19:45.048
- Everything that's good.
- YOUNG CHRISTOPHER: Right.

19:45.348 --> 19:47.217
YOUNG GEOFFREY:
Tolkien, this is Barrow's.

19:47.219 --> 19:48.516
YOUNG CHRISTOPHER:
Our kingdom,

19:48.518 --> 19:50.055
and the best tea in town.

19:51.623 --> 19:53.124
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

20:01.199 --> 20:03.466
- WAITRESS: Another pot of tea?
- YOUNG CHRISTOPHER: Thank you.

20:03.468 --> 20:05.133
And what do you have
that's under a shilling?

20:05.135 --> 20:05.969
And isn't toast.

20:06.270 --> 20:08.370
- Bath buns are four pence.
- Good. A bath bun, please.

20:08.372 --> 20:10.605
- And three forks.
- YOUNG GEOFFREY: Four.

20:10.607 --> 20:11.707
YOUNG ROBERT:
And what about the stick?

20:11.709 --> 20:12.807
YOUNG CHRISTOPHER: The stick?

20:12.809 --> 20:14.576
My father
is a perfect example.

20:14.578 --> 20:16.411
He knows about music.
He loves it.

20:16.413 --> 20:17.813
He spent the greater part
of his youth

20:17.815 --> 20:19.180
studying and composing music.

20:19.182 --> 20:21.817
Christopher has had several
musical pieces published.

20:21.819 --> 20:23.253
YOUNG CHRISTOPHER:
Not several. One.

20:23.255 --> 20:24.352
Pass me the sugar.

20:24.354 --> 20:25.420
And yet when it comes to

20:25.422 --> 20:26.988
pursuing a life
as a composer...

20:26.990 --> 20:29.492
No. "Musical dreams
are a fantasy.

20:29.494 --> 20:31.593
You will do as I did.
You will put them aside."

20:31.595 --> 20:33.497
And where does
the stick come in?

20:33.998 --> 20:35.898
The stick was a metaphor.
Move on from the stick.

20:35.900 --> 20:38.035
YOUNG GEOFFREY:
My mother's exactly the same.

20:38.268 --> 20:40.403
She values poetry.
She loves it.

20:40.938 --> 20:43.642
She refuses to see it
as a potential career.

20:44.275 --> 20:45.776
She sees me as...

20:46.110 --> 20:47.575
a lawyer or an accountant.

20:47.577 --> 20:49.711
Does she carry a stick?

20:49.713 --> 20:52.081
I'm gonna go outside and fetch
a stick, how about that?

20:52.083 --> 20:53.051
Thank you.

20:53.317 --> 20:54.651
Well, at least
your parents discuss it.

20:55.119 --> 20:57.955
If I even mentioned becoming
a painter, I'd be disowned.

20:58.421 --> 21:00.555
- No. I'd be decapitated.
- There!

21:00.557 --> 21:01.892
That's the stick.

21:25.182 --> 21:27.486
I didn't even eat the cake
that they ordered.

21:27.884 --> 21:28.952
Why not?

21:29.719 --> 21:31.519
I wasn't sure
I had enough money.

21:31.521 --> 21:32.890
YOUNG EDITH: Oh.

21:33.556 --> 21:34.793
But this is sweet.

21:39.463 --> 21:40.731
What about you?

21:41.098 --> 21:42.765
(CHUCKLES) What about me?

21:42.767 --> 21:44.870
There must be something
that you want?

21:46.071 --> 21:47.272
To get out of here.

21:48.206 --> 21:49.207
To be free.

21:50.507 --> 21:51.573
I would go somewhere

21:51.575 --> 21:53.877
where I wouldn't
feel like a poor orphan

21:54.545 --> 21:57.278
and... everybody
would be dressed

21:57.280 --> 21:59.116
like kings and queens.

21:59.683 --> 22:01.252
I wouldn't be there
to play piano.

22:02.353 --> 22:04.989
Or to carry
Mrs. Faulkner's purse.

22:06.090 --> 22:08.927
I'd be... greeted and...

22:10.026 --> 22:11.228
appreciated.

22:12.029 --> 22:13.197
Welcomed.

22:14.098 --> 22:16.100
(CHUCKLES) Welcomed.

22:29.180 --> 22:30.882
(GUNFIRE IN DISTANCE)

22:38.323 --> 22:39.554
(COUGHING)

22:39.556 --> 22:41.058
Go back to barracks, Hodges.

22:43.995 --> 22:45.863
(PANTING)

22:48.700 --> 22:51.937
Lieutenant Geoffrey Smith
is a friend.

22:53.470 --> 22:55.739
His mother...

22:57.874 --> 22:59.243
His mother wrote to me. She...

23:00.344 --> 23:02.313
She hasn't heard
from him in weeks.

23:02.947 --> 23:05.283
And he's not responded
to my letters.

23:08.486 --> 23:09.955
I'm worried he might be...

23:13.723 --> 23:15.993
I need to know he's all right.

23:17.628 --> 23:19.597
It really has
nothing to do with you.

23:20.230 --> 23:22.066
He must be a very good friend,
is he, sir?

23:23.567 --> 23:24.835
He's the best.

23:27.371 --> 23:28.806
He'd do the same for me.

23:30.275 --> 23:31.810
(GUNFIRE CONTINUES)

23:37.614 --> 23:38.880
Well, if we're halfway there,

23:38.882 --> 23:40.615
turning back
won't take any longer

23:40.617 --> 23:41.751
than carrying on, will it?

23:41.753 --> 23:42.919
Hodges, please.

23:42.921 --> 23:44.820
Perfectly frank, sir,
by the look on you,

23:44.822 --> 23:46.188
if I don't come along,

23:46.190 --> 23:47.055
you're not gonna find

23:47.057 --> 23:48.959
this Lieutenant
Geoffrey Smith, anyway.

23:53.264 --> 23:55.367
Let me see if I can find
some medicine for you, sir.

23:58.670 --> 24:00.337
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

24:08.078 --> 24:10.044
YOUNG CHRISTOPHER:
Geoffrey, are you trying

24:10.046 --> 24:11.650
to trap my bishop,
you scoundrel?

24:14.719 --> 24:16.487
Gentlemen. A thought.

24:16.819 --> 24:17.986
You know what the trouble is

24:17.988 --> 24:19.655
with all these legends
Tolkien reads?

24:19.657 --> 24:20.723
Enlighten me, Robbie.

24:20.725 --> 24:21.922
They don't have
any women in them.

24:21.924 --> 24:23.692
I'm not talking about pale,

24:23.694 --> 24:25.628
shivering maidens
sitting in towers.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.563
I'm talking about
plump, red-blooded women.

24:27.565 --> 24:30.032
- Could you sit down, please?
- The women of Southern Europe.

24:30.034 --> 24:32.435
Women with large flagons
of wine on their heads.

24:32.437 --> 24:35.204
Robbie, are you incapable
of sitting in silence?

24:35.206 --> 24:37.171
Like our waitress,
just over there.

24:37.173 --> 24:38.640
YOUNG CHRISTOPHER:
Oh, for God's sake.

24:38.642 --> 24:40.109
Robbie, if I lose this game

24:40.111 --> 24:41.511
because of
your endless prattle...

24:41.513 --> 24:43.579
You will lose this game
because of me.

24:43.581 --> 24:44.713
What are you reading now?

24:44.715 --> 24:46.482
I'm reading about
the realm of the dead.

24:46.484 --> 24:48.117
- (GROANS)
- Or at least trying to.

24:48.119 --> 24:49.150
See what I mean?

24:49.152 --> 24:52.123
Presided over by
a giant woman, as it happens.

24:52.590 --> 24:55.959
Hel, a huge
and ruthless goddess.

24:56.260 --> 24:57.927
Is that not red-blooded enough
for you?

24:57.929 --> 24:59.464
It is our waitress.

25:00.265 --> 25:01.065
Hel?

25:01.399 --> 25:03.534
Yes, she rules over the realm
of the dead. Helheimr.

25:03.767 --> 25:06.001
It's a place
where warriors are sent

25:06.003 --> 25:07.902
if they die in the wrong way.

25:07.904 --> 25:10.173
- What's the wrong way?
- Peacefully.

25:10.507 --> 25:12.443
Illness, old age.

25:12.709 --> 25:13.909
Anything other than battle.

25:13.911 --> 25:15.544
Now, that's an idea
I can get behind.

25:15.546 --> 25:17.813
I'm sorry, you're getting
behind dying in battle now?

25:17.815 --> 25:18.913
Not literally.

25:18.915 --> 25:21.251
I can die in any way
the Fates choose,

25:21.552 --> 25:22.786
that's not up to me.

25:23.254 --> 25:26.523
But what is within my power
is to decide how I live.

25:26.723 --> 25:29.792
Courageously or timidly.
(CLAPS HANDS)

25:29.794 --> 25:31.794
Helheimr! It should be
our warning. Our challenge.

25:31.796 --> 25:32.729
Yes, I know.

25:33.030 --> 25:34.130
But you should learn
how to pronounce it first.

25:34.132 --> 25:36.799
Come on. Challenge me.
Set me a quest.

25:36.801 --> 25:38.633
I'll show you
how to avoid Helheimr.

25:38.635 --> 25:40.535
I challenge you to...

25:40.537 --> 25:42.604
sit in silence for 25 minutes.

25:42.606 --> 25:43.706
Shut up, Geoffrey.

25:43.708 --> 25:44.805
I'm serious.

25:44.807 --> 25:46.007
Propose to the waitress.

25:46.009 --> 25:47.811
- YOUNG GEOFFREY: Christopher.
- (SCOFFS) What?

25:49.580 --> 25:50.879
An excellent idea.

25:50.881 --> 25:52.413
Robbie, don't you dare
do anything of the kind.

25:52.415 --> 25:54.885
That's what I call
a quest against Helheimr.

25:58.422 --> 25:59.857
Helheimr!

26:01.424 --> 26:05.328
Madam. My lady of the lake,
the bearer of my dreams.

26:06.095 --> 26:07.765
Would you do me
the greatest honor,

26:08.266 --> 26:11.002
sharing an infinite future
with me...

26:21.813 --> 26:23.544
(BOYS LAUGHING)

26:23.546 --> 26:24.949
We should form a club.

26:25.350 --> 26:27.149
- What?
- A brotherhood.

26:27.151 --> 26:29.752
Aren't we already a club?
A tea drinking club?

26:29.754 --> 26:30.755
A tea drinking club,

26:31.021 --> 26:32.655
sounds like something
my stepmother would go to.

26:32.657 --> 26:33.691
The Tea Club.

26:34.092 --> 26:36.592
It doesn't sound any better
just because you repeated it.

26:36.594 --> 26:37.692
The Birmingham Boys.

26:37.694 --> 26:39.362
That sounds like a circus act.

26:39.930 --> 26:42.432
The Boys of Barrow's Stores.

26:43.566 --> 26:44.902
Barrovians.

26:46.003 --> 26:48.969
The Tea Club
and Barrovian Society.

26:48.971 --> 26:50.573
I think that's far too long.

26:50.575 --> 26:51.674
The T. C. B. S.

26:51.676 --> 26:53.074
The T. C. B. S.

26:53.076 --> 26:55.043
Are you sure that doesn't
sound like a disease?

26:55.045 --> 26:56.445
No, listen, I don't care
what it's called.

26:56.447 --> 26:58.447
As long as we pledge
our loyalty to each other.

26:58.449 --> 26:59.249
Exactly.

26:59.484 --> 27:01.749
T. C. B. S. That's settled.
Now what do we do?

27:01.751 --> 27:02.883
We change the world.

27:02.885 --> 27:04.386
Oh, good. Something simple.

27:04.388 --> 27:05.954
Through art, you clown.

27:05.956 --> 27:08.059
Through the power of art.

27:16.700 --> 27:17.602
Brothers,

27:18.568 --> 27:19.935
will you join your comrades

27:19.937 --> 27:21.840
in this act
of changing the world?

- We will.
- We will.

- So will I.
- No, that's not true.

55:28.089 --> 55:29.625
Edith, please. Look...

55:32.328 --> 55:33.362
I let myself believe

55:33.629 --> 55:35.698
that there were happy endings
for people like us.

55:36.431 --> 55:37.700
But there aren't.

55:37.933 --> 55:38.868
There can't be.

55:42.538 --> 55:44.306
But you get your happy ending.

55:46.776 --> 55:48.710

56:18.140 --> 56:19.509
I need to rest, Sam.

56:19.908 --> 56:21.910
You have to find Geoffrey.

56:22.477 --> 56:23.676
Sir, I'm not leaving you here.

56:23.678 --> 56:26.145
- Sam.
- I'm not leaving you here.

56:26.147 --> 56:28.549
Sam. It's an order.

56:28.984 --> 56:32.154
Find Geoffrey
and tell him not to lose hope.

For goodness' sake.

57:11.794 --> 57:14.094
I was wondering,
did I mention before...

57:14.096 --> 57:15.763
The set of the play is
very much inspired

57:15.765 --> 57:17.031
by the architecture
of Trinity.

57:17.033 --> 57:17.864
Sorry, chaps.

57:17.866 --> 57:20.168
- But what's it about?
- Well...

57:20.368 --> 57:23.270
- And so, you're the poet?
- No, uh, that's Geoffrey.

57:23.272 --> 57:25.808
I think you Oxford men
should be upping the game. No?

57:26.040 --> 57:27.774
- Where are we off to next?
- Yes, do tell.

57:27.776 --> 57:29.942
Yes, where shall we...?
Sorry, excuse me.

57:29.944 --> 57:31.080

- CHRISTOPHER: Hurry up!

57:42.524 --> 57:43.593
GEOFFREY: Shh!

57:43.859 --> 57:46.091
I think that particular match
it was the Oxford men

57:46.093 --> 57:48.027
- versus the Cambridge boys.
- (LAUGHTER)

the referee was blind.

57:50.700 --> 57:52.098
CHRISTOPHER: I hereby declare

57:52.100 --> 57:54.734
the third Oxford council
of the T.C.B.S.

57:54.736 --> 57:56.671
well and truly open.

57:56.904 --> 57:58.004
And would like to welcome

57:58.006 --> 57:59.640
our damsels
from the Eagle and Child

57:59.642 --> 58:00.775
as honorary guests.

58:00.777 --> 58:02.808
May all our meetings
take place

58:02.810 --> 58:03.879
on an abandoned omnibus.

58:04.113 --> 58:05.712
I think the word "abandoned"
might be stretching it.

58:05.714 --> 58:06.913
- Maybe a bit.
- (LAUGHTER)

58:06.915 --> 58:08.584
MARY: What is the T.C.B.?

58:09.018 --> 58:10.886
- ROBERT: Oh, the T.C.B.S.
- Oh.

58:11.687 --> 58:14.223
I don't think you like me,
Mr. Burglar.

58:14.756 --> 58:16.957
- Sorry, I was just...
- I apologize for my friend.

58:16.959 --> 58:18.926
- He's pining for someone.
- What?

58:18.928 --> 58:20.861
CHRISTOPHER: He's pining
for the delectable Miss Bratt.

58:20.863 --> 58:21.929
ROBERT: Take no notice of him.

58:21.931 --> 58:23.129
Who's the delectable
Miss Bratt?

58:23.131 --> 58:24.663
- She's no one.
- Oh, is she, Tollers?

58:24.665 --> 58:25.766
The way you've been
moping around

58:25.768 --> 58:26.769
for the past couple of months.

58:26.968 --> 58:28.467
It's not very nice
to talk about another lady

58:28.469 --> 58:29.471
when you're with someone.

58:29.739 --> 58:31.274
No, you're absolutely right.
I apologize, Myrtle.

58:31.540 --> 58:33.105
- It's Beryl.
- (LAUGHTER)

58:33.107 --> 58:35.542

of a beautiful girl

58:35.544 --> 58:36.975
and he can't even
remember her name.

58:36.977 --> 58:38.312
I'm sorry if my difficulties

58:38.314 --> 58:39.812
are getting in the way
of your diversions.

58:39.814 --> 58:41.380
Ah, you made a decision,
Tolkien.

58:41.382 --> 58:42.584
Nobody forced you into it.

58:42.884 --> 58:44.317
- What?
- CHRISTOPHER: Edith or Oxford.

58:44.319 --> 58:46.020
You chose Oxford,
and here you are!

58:46.022 --> 58:48.087
Sat on a commandeered bus
with three beautiful girls

58:48.089 --> 58:49.922
and your best friends. For
God's sake, enjoy yourself!

58:49.924 --> 58:51.725
- Nobody forced me?
- CHRISTOPHER: Oh, yes...

58:51.727 --> 58:53.025
The priest. Your benefactor.

58:53.027 --> 58:54.096
Chris, this is
getting out of hand.

58:54.495 --> 58:56.161
- Don't talk about things you...
- Thank you. This was wonderful.

58:56.163 --> 58:57.596
You let her go.
You didn't want her

58:57.598 --> 58:58.567
- more than you wanted Oxford.
- No.

58:58.935 --> 59:00.533
- I didn't have a choice.
- Does that make you a rotter?

59:00.535 --> 59:01.734
Does that make you
something else?

59:01.736 --> 59:03.704
- What's the matter with you?
- Just shut up!

- TOLKIEN: Chris. Sorry, Chris.

59:09.143 --> 59:11.312
- Bloody hell, Tollers.
- Are you all right?

59:11.747 --> 59:12.846
For an intellectual,

59:12.848 --> 59:14.515
you've quite
an impressive right hook.

59:14.517 --> 59:16.183
- Hit me back. Please.
- No.

59:16.185 --> 59:17.887
Hit me back right now.
Please, Chris.

59:18.087 --> 59:19.919
- Forget it. Forget it.
- TOLKIEN: Chris, please.

59:19.921 --> 59:21.223

59:23.326 --> 59:25.461
No, that was horrible of me.
I'm sorry.

59:28.964 --> 59:32.335
ROBERT: What you need
to understand, Tolkien, you...

59:32.902 --> 59:34.569
poor lawless orphan,

59:35.069 --> 59:37.073
is that we are your brothers.

59:37.707 --> 59:38.839
Through everything.

59:38.841 --> 59:40.777
Yes, absolutely.

59:41.143 --> 59:42.176
Exactly.

59:42.178 --> 59:45.080
ROBERT: This is more than...
just a friendship.

59:45.547 --> 59:46.949
It's an alliance.

59:47.649 --> 59:50.118
An invincible alliance.

Shh. Get down.

Hold the door, George.

01:00:08.969 --> 01:00:10.973

01:00:11.906 --> 01:00:14.376
They're speaking to the rector
in the morning.

01:00:15.777 --> 01:00:16.779
What about you?

01:00:17.046 --> 01:00:19.645
Well, Gilson and Wiseman,
the Cambridge swines,

01:00:19.647 --> 01:00:21.015
have been let go already.

01:00:21.415 --> 01:00:22.815
I wasn't quite so lucky.

01:00:22.817 --> 01:00:23.884
Looks like I'll be joining you

01:00:23.886 --> 01:00:25.486
in the rector's office
tomorrow.

01:00:25.488 --> 01:00:27.056
Death by lecture.

01:00:27.489 --> 01:00:28.422
I'm sorry, Geoff.

01:00:28.424 --> 01:00:30.626
- No, it's not your fault.
- No, it is.

01:00:31.058 --> 01:00:32.859
If it wasn't for me,
you'd be in the arms

01:00:32.861 --> 01:00:34.762
of the delightful Mary by now.

01:00:35.062 --> 01:00:37.330
GEOFFREY: Please. The moment
I showed any interest,

01:00:37.332 --> 01:00:39.201
she started talking about
her sweetheart.

01:00:39.502 --> 01:00:41.871

until Wiseman ruined it.

01:01:15.603 --> 01:01:17.806
GEOFFREY: The rector was
honestly writing to my mother.

01:01:18.239 --> 01:01:20.408
Do you think I stand a chance
of becoming a poet after this?

01:01:21.176 --> 01:01:24.243
She's going to lose her mind.
So, that's that.

01:01:24.245 --> 01:01:26.814
ROBERT: Oh, Geoffrey's
only lost his career.

01:01:27.149 --> 01:01:28.917
What did you get, Tolkien?

01:01:30.618 --> 01:01:33.154
- I got sent down.
- (ALL LAUGH)

(STAMMERS)
Are you joking, Tollers?

01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:36.924
They can't
send you down for that.

01:01:36.926 --> 01:01:38.290
For a bloody picnic on a bus.

01:01:38.292 --> 01:01:39.961
The bus was the least of it.

01:01:41.062 --> 01:01:42.497
I haven't achieved the grades.

01:01:42.696 --> 01:01:43.830
According to the rector,

01:01:43.832 --> 01:01:45.297
I have no flair
for the Greats,

01:01:45.299 --> 01:01:48.469
and only a passing interest
in the ancient Greeks.

01:01:48.471 --> 01:01:49.672
So, they won't endorse
my scholarship.

01:01:49.939 --> 01:01:51.605
Yes, but that doesn't mean
you have to go down.

01:01:51.806 --> 01:01:54.473
No, of course not.
How stupid of me.

01:01:54.475 --> 01:01:56.442
Yes, when Mama gets back
from Monte Carlo,

01:01:56.444 --> 01:01:57.944
I'll ask her
to write another check.

01:02:03.051 --> 01:02:04.884
They'll endorse my scholarship
until the end of term.

01:02:04.886 --> 01:02:07.022
After that, I have to finance
my own studies.

01:02:07.221 --> 01:02:08.754
Which is, of course,
impossible,

01:02:08.756 --> 01:02:10.558
so, get a job, I suppose.

01:02:12.993 --> 01:02:14.062
Well, doing what?

01:02:15.464 --> 01:02:18.600
I will go back to Birmingham
and work in a bakery.

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:22.736
Or I will make shoes
for rich dimwits like you

01:02:22.738 --> 01:02:23.939

01:31:22.309 --> 01:31:23.444
I could hear him.

Geoffrey is... is dead.

01:31:31.283 --> 01:31:33.219
He died weeks ago.

01:31:33.519 --> 01:31:34.754
What?

01:31:36.322 --> 01:31:37.422
No.

he was hit.

01:31:43.663 --> 01:31:44.864
He's also dead.

01:31:50.636 --> 01:31:51.938
I'm sorry.

in the war to end all wars.

TOLKIEN: What do you say?

01:32:31.810 --> 01:32:33.412
Words are useless.

01:32:33.712 --> 01:32:35.349
Modern words, anyway.

never left your bedside.

01:32:57.504 --> 01:32:58.939
Not once.

01:33:02.075 --> 01:33:03.978
You were right to pursue her.

01:33:08.614 --> 01:33:09.983
Thank you.

and helpless as individuals,</i>

to the immortal four!</i>

This is where Geoffrey sat.

01:39:14.212 --> 01:39:17.183
I was wondering,
with your permission,

01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:19.917
perhaps I might try to get

01:39:19.919 --> 01:39:21.755
a volume
of his poems published.

01:39:23.657 --> 01:39:25.159
His poems?

01:39:26.858 --> 01:39:28.327
I think he was...

01:39:28.862 --> 01:39:29.730
really very talented.

01:39:29.929 --> 01:39:32.031
I would like to bring him
to people's attention.

write the foreword myself.

I don't know, I...

01:39:39.538 --> 01:39:41.505
I'm inclined to say no,
Mr. Tolkien.

01:39:41.507 --> 01:39:44.611
He was really very good.
I think it's important.

01:39:47.546 --> 01:39:49.648
I used to be fond of poetry.

01:39:50.582 --> 01:39:53.353
I sometimes wondered
if that was where Geoffrey...

01:39:58.625 --> 01:40:02.395
I'm sorry, I can't see what
possible good it would do.

01:40:03.462 --> 01:40:05.262
It would do the most
extraordinary good.

Please believe me.

01:40:10.170 --> 01:40:11.738
I never knew Geoffrey

01:40:13.238 --> 01:40:14.875
as much as I would have liked.

01:40:18.010 --> 01:40:19.412

Please, tell me.

01:40:38.197 --> 01:40:39.865
And even at the beginning,
even...

01:40:41.166 --> 01:40:42.736
before we were friends,

01:40:44.837 --> 01:40:45.973

01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:55.482

01:40:57.149 --> 01:40:59.018
He was the person
who most embodied

01:40:59.352 --> 01:41:00.953

what good it could do,
and the... poets,

01:41:22.943 --> 01:41:23.977

01:41:25.245 --> 01:41:27.046
