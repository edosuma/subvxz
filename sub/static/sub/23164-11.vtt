WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:02.214
Excuse me, I don't
believe we've met.

00:04.401 --> 00:06.338
Hey, big guy.
Welcome to the party!

00:06.403 --> 00:07.438
Luther?

00:07.504 --> 00:09.842
Luther H. Gillie,
the one and only.

00:09.907 --> 00:13.113
Mr. Masters' literary
masterpiece has been stolen.

00:13.177 --> 00:14.680
An honest to God case.

00:14.746 --> 00:17.685
Not 24 hours after
I drop anchor on this rock.

00:17.749 --> 00:19.219
Dad says every time
he helps you out,

00:19.284 --> 00:20.854
you get into
all kinds of trouble.

00:20.919 --> 00:22.221
People shooting
at you and stuff.

02:32.280 --> 02:35.887
I guess the earliest memory I
have of my Grandfather Sullivan

02:35.950 --> 02:40.492
is a kind of heart to heart talk we had
walking down by the Rappahannock River

02:40.556 --> 02:42.560
when I was six years old.

02:44.026 --> 02:46.498
We used to hunt for wild
asparagus down by the river

02:46.563 --> 02:49.035
to take home for my mom
to cook for dinner.

02:49.098 --> 02:52.872
Anyway, on this particular walk,
my grandfather confided in me

02:52.936 --> 02:57.846
that probably the only thing you
could count on in life is change.

03:01.946 --> 03:06.422
That no matter how much you wanted
things to stay the same, they never did.

03:08.653 --> 03:11.025
And the change itself
wasn't bad.

03:11.089 --> 03:14.463
It's just that the transitions
were sometimes tricky.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.275
Well, I'm not sure I understood what
he was talking about at the time.

03:25.339 --> 03:28.712
I was more interested
in asparagus than transition.

03:28.776 --> 03:30.779
But I never forgot it.

03:30.845 --> 03:34.586
And I guess if there's one thing
I could in some way pass on,

03:35.216 --> 03:38.021
it would be
my grandfather's advice,

03:38.086 --> 03:40.457
"Don't be a Fraid
oF transitions."

03:41.523 --> 03:43.460
"They make you strong."

03:45.594 --> 03:49.970
$12,562 for the weekend
cruise in the Aegean Sea.

03:50.032 --> 03:51.467
Check.

03:51.534 --> 03:54.038
$6,720 for flowers.

03:54.103 --> 03:56.208
We'll want to break those down
by name and date of delivery.

03:56.273 --> 03:57.708
Quite. I have them
all right here.

03:57.774 --> 04:00.279
And what about this year's
bonuses for the household staff?

04:00.343 --> 04:02.881
I've decided to
increase them to 12O_.

04:03.447 --> 04:04.482
Sir?

04:10.087 --> 04:13.427
Well, I meant Mr.
Masters, naturally.

04:13.925 --> 04:15.361
Naturally.

04:18.096 --> 04:21.937
Magnum, Mr. Kunkle and I are quite busy at
the moment going over Mr. Masters accounts.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.070
Oh, I can see that. Hi, Bruce.

04:24.136 --> 04:26.908
Hi, Mr. Magnum. You
have his authorization?

04:26.974 --> 04:29.611
What? Mr. Masters'
authorization.

04:29.676 --> 04:32.348
We can't go around giving raises
without his authorization.

04:32.412 --> 04:37.055
No. That wouldn't be right spending
Robin's money without his authorization.

04:37.117 --> 04:38.854
Would it, Higgins?

04:38.920 --> 04:40.790
Just set it aside.
We'll go over it later.

04:40.855 --> 04:43.794
No, no, I don't mind.
It's okay, Higgins.

04:43.858 --> 04:49.569
I don't mind waiting
while you sort this out.

04:49.631 --> 04:53.205
Was there something you wanted or did you
merely come over here to be an obstructionist?

04:53.268 --> 04:57.744
Oh, I just wanted to tell you that I
need to take some time off to go home.

04:57.807 --> 04:59.443
A family problem?

05:00.042 --> 05:04.083
No. I just want to take some time off.
A couple of weeks. Maybe a month.

05:04.146 --> 05:05.516
Right now?

05:06.083 --> 05:07.763
Yeah, I was hoping
to leave in the morning.

05:07.818 --> 05:10.691
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Now where were we?

05:10.755 --> 05:11.790
Higgins.

05:11.856 --> 05:14.097
I'm right in the middle of
the year-end financial report.

05:14.157 --> 05:16.228
The lawn is in desperate
need of fertilization,

05:16.294 --> 05:18.464
the trim around the windows
and doors needs painting,

05:18.529 --> 05:21.636
and Kenii has requested help
in planting the tulip beds.

05:21.700 --> 05:23.503
All of which can wait
till I get back.

05:23.569 --> 05:25.104
According to
the farmer's almanac,

05:25.169 --> 05:29.044
the tulip beds must be planted tomorrow
night at midnight for the greatest effect.

05:29.108 --> 05:32.782
I won't have you risk our
prize-winning gardens on a whim.

05:32.846 --> 05:36.486
You want me to postpone my trip
for a silly bed of flowers?

05:38.953 --> 05:41.057
Higgins, it's important.

05:41.121 --> 05:43.392
Your regular two week vacation
is coming up in three months.

05:43.457 --> 05:46.429
I suggest you make
your plans accordingly.

05:46.494 --> 05:47.629
Next category.

05:47.695 --> 05:49.598
Next category.

05:49.663 --> 05:50.699
The next category.

05:50.766 --> 05:52.769
Yes, I have it right here.

05:58.173 --> 06:00.010
Robin Masters' estate.

06:01.978 --> 06:05.552
Oh, yes, Miss Donaldson. I didn't
expect to hear from you so soon.

06:06.549 --> 06:09.121
What? You mean to say...

06:12.121 --> 06:15.228
Yes. Yes, of course.
You may count on it.

06:28.440 --> 06:30.310
Magnum, there you are.

06:30.843 --> 06:35.051
I wanted you to know I've reconsidered.
You may have your time off.

06:35.114 --> 06:38.488
Three weeks, a month.
Whatever you like.

06:39.052 --> 06:40.053
Only, uh...

06:40.120 --> 06:44.395
I need for you to take care of one minor
little investigative problem for me

06:44.458 --> 06:45.493
before you leave.

06:45.559 --> 06:48.331
I can't. I've decided
to leave tonight.

06:48.395 --> 06:52.002
Why, surely you can postpone a day or two.
It's important.

06:55.236 --> 06:58.442
Yes, well, I suppose
you have your own priorities.

06:59.507 --> 07:01.712
It's probably too
late now, anyway.

07:01.777 --> 07:04.749
I doubt that you would
even be able to help.

07:06.081 --> 07:11.158
Still, I would like to pose one hypothetical
question just to ease my state of mind.

07:11.921 --> 07:14.426
If you received a telegram
from Mr. Masters' publishers

07:14.491 --> 07:17.296
instructing you to release
Mr. Masters' latest novel

07:17.360 --> 07:19.197
to a messenger service
they had hired.

07:19.262 --> 07:21.299
Mr. Masters' latest novel?

07:21.364 --> 07:26.308
A novel which is without a doubt his finest,
perhaps even Pulitzer Prize material.

07:27.304 --> 07:32.113
Robin, king of the potboilers, has
written a Pulitzer Prize winning novel?

07:32.177 --> 07:36.686
Regardless of the quality of the
material, what would you do?

07:36.748 --> 07:37.749
About what?

07:37.816 --> 07:39.019
About the manuscript.

07:39.085 --> 07:41.489
Would you turn it over
to the messenger service?

07:41.553 --> 07:43.156
Yeah, I guess so. Why not?

07:43.221 --> 07:44.791
Precisely my reasoning.

07:44.857 --> 07:48.966
A bit more polysyllabic, perhaps, but
the same conclusion, nevertheless.

07:49.029 --> 07:50.509
Look, I hate to cut
this off, Higgins,

07:50.530 --> 07:53.002
but there's some things
I have to do before I leave.

07:53.066 --> 07:56.606
Unfortunately, I've only just learned
that the messenger service was bogus,

07:56.670 --> 07:58.407
the telegram a fake.

07:58.472 --> 08:01.444
Mr. Masters' literary
masterpiece has been stolen.

08:01.508 --> 08:04.982
And someone must find it before
his publisher finds out.

08:05.513 --> 08:07.483
You lost the manuscript?

08:08.650 --> 08:12.491
Did I mention I'd be willing to pay
your expenses home, round trip?

08:12.555 --> 08:14.792
After the manuscript is found?

08:20.797 --> 08:23.736
Another thing my grandfather
told me about change

08:23.800 --> 08:27.507
is that it doesn't always come
along at a convenient time.

08:28.338 --> 08:30.475
In fact, it usually happens

08:30.540 --> 08:33.613
right when you're in the middle
of doing something else.

08:33.678 --> 08:37.318
And that it's important to
finish up whatever you're doing.

08:37.982 --> 08:40.922
Even if it begins to
seem like dull routine.

08:45.424 --> 08:50.133
Because it's how you make the transitions
that's as important as making them.

08:53.365 --> 08:55.970
At least, that's what
I think he said.

09:34.244 --> 09:37.083
Hey, big guy.
Welcome to the party!

09:38.149 --> 09:39.217
Luther?

09:39.283 --> 09:41.553
Luther H. Gillie,
the one and only.

09:41.618 --> 09:43.723
Bet you're surprised to see me.

09:54.331 --> 09:57.303
I call it a St. Louis Sunrise. I
made it up myself. Here, try it.

09:57.368 --> 09:59.271
I don't want a drink, Luther.

09:59.336 --> 10:00.371
How about a chip?

10:00.437 --> 10:01.940
No! Want to dance?

10:02.006 --> 10:03.309
No! Hi.

10:03.375 --> 10:04.677
Cleo! Great party, huh?

10:04.743 --> 10:05.744
What are you doing here?

10:05.810 --> 10:07.848
Rick said he was real surprised
to hear from your friend Luther.

10:07.913 --> 10:09.181
You're here with Rick?

10:09.247 --> 10:10.282
Excuse me.

10:10.348 --> 10:11.851
Hey, where are you going, Rick?

10:11.917 --> 10:13.720
Come on, let's dance.

10:13.786 --> 10:16.124
No. Thanks. Did Rick
ask anything about us?

10:16.188 --> 10:18.659
What about us?
You know, if we ever...

10:18.725 --> 10:20.327
if we ever what?

10:21.027 --> 10:22.295
Nothing. Hi, Rick.

10:22.362 --> 10:24.733
Hey, Thomas, great party.
Come on, Cleo. We got to go.

10:24.798 --> 10:25.866
No, already?

10:25.932 --> 10:29.172
Sorry, baby, we got early
dinner reservations. Aww, okay.

10:29.236 --> 10:31.306
Okay. Bye, Thomas.

10:31.371 --> 10:33.174
See you, Thomas. Bye.

10:38.212 --> 10:39.949
That's my chicken!

10:48.858 --> 10:51.530
If you don't mind my saying so,
big guy, you seem a little tense.

10:51.594 --> 10:52.996
You have got to
learn to lighten up.

10:53.062 --> 10:54.999
Luther, I don't know
what you're doing here.

10:55.064 --> 10:56.066
You invited me.

10:56.132 --> 10:57.234
Or even how you got in here.

10:57.300 --> 11:00.139
The butler let me in. I told him we
were working on a big case together.

11:00.203 --> 11:01.371
I invited you?

11:01.438 --> 11:04.478
Practically. I said, "if you're ever in St.
Louis, look me up."

11:04.542 --> 11:06.178
You said, "Sure, Luther."

11:06.243 --> 11:09.750
I figure that means
vice versa. So, here I am.

11:09.815 --> 11:13.188
It's the first real vacation
I've had in 20 odd years.

11:13.250 --> 11:15.722
Of course, some of them
were odder than others.

11:18.390 --> 11:19.860
Odder than others!

11:19.926 --> 11:24.568
Luther, you and your friends are
going to have to get out of here.

11:24.630 --> 11:26.166
There are some
things I have to do.

11:26.232 --> 11:27.534
Working on a big case?

11:27.600 --> 11:29.203
Yeah, a really big case.
Why didn't you say so?

11:29.268 --> 11:32.007
I'll lose these bozos
and be back to help you out.

11:32.071 --> 11:34.008
No! Luther. Don't do
anything until I get back.

11:34.073 --> 11:36.010
Hey, pal, anything for you.

11:36.076 --> 11:40.350
Come on, you bozos.
This bash is traveling.

11:40.414 --> 11:41.784
Luther!

11:48.523 --> 11:52.130
Mr. Magnum, I thought you were working
on some case for Mr. Higgins.

11:52.193 --> 11:54.398
And I thought you were working
on the books for Robin.

11:54.463 --> 11:57.468
Well, I never get much chance to
just let it all hang out, you know?

11:57.533 --> 11:59.236
You're not going to tell Mr.
Higgins about this, are you?

11:59.301 --> 12:01.906
Excuse me, I don't
believe we've met.

12:01.972 --> 12:04.210
Oh. Suzi this is Thomas Magnum.
Magnum, Suzi.

12:04.274 --> 12:05.309
- Hi, Suzi.
- Hi.

12:05.375 --> 12:06.677
I don't mean to be rude, but...

12:06.743 --> 12:10.117
You heard what the big guy said.
He's got work to do. Let's go.

12:10.180 --> 12:11.482
See you later?

12:12.282 --> 12:16.090
Hey, you know, you remind me of my
ex-partner, Chuckie's second wife.

12:16.154 --> 12:18.558
His second and also his fourth.

12:18.623 --> 12:22.598
And you may not believe this, but he
regretted the day he ever let her get away.

12:22.661 --> 12:24.264
- Again.
- Really?

12:24.329 --> 12:26.766
Mr. Magnum, I'd really
appreciate if you could

12:26.832 --> 12:28.235
possibly see your
way clear to...

12:28.300 --> 12:31.640
Don't worry, Bruce. I won't tell
Higgins about seeing you here.

12:31.704 --> 12:34.008
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

12:34.607 --> 12:35.608
Thank you.

12:35.675 --> 12:36.943
Right.

12:39.145 --> 12:40.213
Suzi!

12:49.891 --> 12:51.661
Yes, yes, of course.

12:52.093 --> 12:54.197
I will have someone
there to pick you up.

12:54.262 --> 12:56.833
No trouble at all. Goodbye.

12:58.901 --> 13:02.908
Okay. Here you are, Higgins. An
invoice for my time and expenses.

13:02.972 --> 13:04.342
You've found the manuscript?

13:04.407 --> 13:06.911
No. I don't think we're going to
find the manuscript, Higgins.

13:06.977 --> 13:09.782
See, the address the messenger
service gave you is a phony,

13:09.847 --> 13:12.419
the Western Union office had no
record of who called in the telegram.

13:12.483 --> 13:14.687
So, we're just
kind of out of leads.

13:14.751 --> 13:16.187
So, here's a bill
for my services.

13:16.253 --> 13:20.695
I believe the agreed upon payment was
one round trip airfare to Tidewater.

13:22.126 --> 13:24.764
Yes. Yes. Of course, I'll...

13:26.431 --> 13:29.103
I'll have Mr. Kunkle
draft you a check.

13:29.902 --> 13:32.841
I'll simply have to figure out some
other way to deal with Miss Donaldson.

13:32.905 --> 13:33.940
Miss Donaldson?

13:34.006 --> 13:35.309
Mr. Masters' publisher.

13:35.374 --> 13:37.411
She's decided to come and pick
up the manuscript herself.

13:37.476 --> 13:39.914
She's arriving on the
first flight tomorrow morning.

13:39.980 --> 13:42.952
Mr. Masters has received huge
cash advances on the novel.

13:43.016 --> 13:46.656
I suppose he'll be liable to a
lawsuit if he doesn't deliver.

13:46.720 --> 13:50.461
Well, tell her you'll deliver the
manuscript as soon as you get another copy.

13:50.524 --> 13:51.693
There are no copies.

13:51.759 --> 13:54.163
That's ridiculous.
There's got to be copies.

13:54.227 --> 13:56.398
It's a whim of Mr. Masters.

13:56.464 --> 13:59.570
He feels that more than
one copy is bad luck.

13:59.634 --> 14:03.141
Well, what about the tapes? The
tapes he dictates his book into?

14:03.205 --> 14:04.541
Destroyed.

14:05.040 --> 14:07.645
As soon as the written manuscript
is received. Standard procedure.

14:07.709 --> 14:10.381
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

14:10.445 --> 14:11.480
What did you say?

14:11.548 --> 14:12.683
We destroyed the tapes.

14:12.749 --> 14:13.851
No.

14:13.917 --> 14:18.026
You said I'll have Mr.
Kunkle draft you a check.

14:18.088 --> 14:21.027
How can you do that
without Robin's approval?

14:23.394 --> 14:27.568
I'll take it out of my own salary,
naturally, while I've still got a salary.

14:27.631 --> 14:31.405
I'm quite certain Mr. Masters will fire
me once the news of this fiasco breaks.

14:31.468 --> 14:34.675
He won't fire you.
Especially if he is you.

14:34.739 --> 14:36.442
Oh, Magnum, please.

14:36.508 --> 14:39.280
If he is not you
and you are not him,

14:39.344 --> 14:42.517
why did you have the only
copy of the manuscript?

14:43.683 --> 14:47.190
I suppose a change is good for
all of us from time to time.

14:47.254 --> 14:48.991
I shall hate to have
to leave this place,

14:50.090 --> 14:53.196
but perhaps I've become
complacent here anyway.

14:53.260 --> 14:56.032
Well, Higgins, I mean,

14:57.198 --> 15:00.370
whatever the case,
it's got to turn up.

15:00.434 --> 15:04.609
Whoever stole it will be calling in
any minute with a ransom request.

15:05.006 --> 15:06.642
We'll call the police,
they'll pick up the thief,

15:06.708 --> 15:09.046
Miss Donaldson will never
know anything about it.

15:09.111 --> 15:12.518
I suppose there's a million to one shot
that something like that could happen.

15:12.581 --> 15:15.954
Of course it could. What
else could it be but ransom?

15:17.453 --> 15:20.793
You'll see, Higgins. Everything
will be fine in the morning.

15:21.124 --> 15:23.027
Well, in the meantime, I
better get the books in order

15:23.093 --> 15:25.965
before my meeting with Miss
Donaldson in the morning.

15:26.029 --> 15:27.232
Right!

15:35.307 --> 15:37.477
I guess the one thing
my grandfather told me

15:37.541 --> 15:39.913
that stuck in my mind
more than anything else,

15:39.978 --> 15:42.683
was the part about finishing up
whatever you're in the middle of

15:42.748 --> 15:44.685
before going on
to the next thing.

15:44.750 --> 15:46.587
No matter how hard
I tried to ignore it,

15:46.652 --> 15:51.629
that part had an annoying way of popping into
my mind when I really didn't want it to.

15:53.926 --> 15:55.396
Money, resentment...

15:56.263 --> 15:57.632
Revenge.

16:06.006 --> 16:07.944
Yeah. Yeah.

16:16.885 --> 16:17.954
No.

16:20.956 --> 16:23.695
If you knew Suzi.

16:24.627 --> 16:26.797
Like I know Suzi.

16:26.862 --> 16:28.465
Oh, oh.

16:28.865 --> 16:30.167
Oh, what a gal.

16:30.233 --> 16:33.773
There's none so classy
As that fair lassie.

16:41.212 --> 16:42.748
Sorry, I'm late. What?

16:42.814 --> 16:44.283
I didn't wake you, did I?

16:44.349 --> 16:45.417
What time is it?

16:45.483 --> 16:46.651
12:30.

16:47.286 --> 16:51.360
Rick was entertaining us at the club
with your theory about the butler.

16:51.422 --> 16:52.490
My theory?

16:52.558 --> 16:54.962
Yeah. About the butler
being Robin Masters.

16:56.329 --> 16:58.332
It gave us a great laugh.

16:59.565 --> 17:01.068
Especially Suzi.

17:01.134 --> 17:03.806
You know, you meet some really
nice people on vacation.

17:04.704 --> 17:06.138
Was Rick still with Cleo?

17:06.207 --> 17:09.413
Are you kidding? Those two
lovebirds are inseparable.

17:09.476 --> 17:12.915
Looks like you need some help, big guy.
Good thing I showed up.

17:12.980 --> 17:15.885
Look, Luther, I know it's late,

17:15.950 --> 17:18.355
and you can't do anything
about it tonight.

17:18.420 --> 17:20.724
But first thing in the morning,

17:21.521 --> 17:23.560
you're gonna have to find
a new place to stay.

17:23.625 --> 17:26.830
Don't be ridiculous.
You know me better than that.

17:27.329 --> 17:30.402
I wouldn't think of leaving you
alone with a big case to crack.

17:30.465 --> 17:33.270
Whatever happened to Luther
Gillie who works alone?

17:33.336 --> 17:34.672
It's a trade-off.

17:34.737 --> 17:38.511
I'll pitch in here and later on you can
help me nail those Phoenix scrunge-o's

17:38.574 --> 17:41.146
that are trying to steal
my football team.

17:41.211 --> 17:42.914
Good night, Luther.

17:43.247 --> 17:45.652
What are you,
UN-American or something?

17:45.716 --> 17:46.717
Huh?

17:47.484 --> 17:49.889
By the way, Luther,
how's Blanche?

17:50.155 --> 17:52.325
Blanche? Couldn't be better.

17:52.924 --> 17:54.259
Waiting for me to get
home, of course.

17:54.325 --> 17:57.832
But you gotta always keep them
guessing just a little bit, you know?

17:57.896 --> 18:01.370
Can't let them get too close
or first thing you know, wham!

18:01.433 --> 18:04.840
They've got that old marriage
knot right around your throat.

18:04.904 --> 18:06.474
So, you never got married?

18:06.539 --> 18:08.576
What? You never got married?

18:08.641 --> 18:11.480
Luther Gillie?
I'm not the marrying type.

18:12.412 --> 18:13.915
You know that.

18:15.749 --> 18:17.519
Good night, Luther.

18:17.584 --> 18:18.886
Good night.

18:52.656 --> 18:57.232
One thing I learned about change
on my own, you can't hurry it up.

18:57.295 --> 18:59.799
Even though you may think you're
ready for something to change,

18:59.865 --> 19:02.502
it has to come about
in its own time.

19:02.567 --> 19:05.171
And there's not a whole lot
you can do to hurry it up,

19:05.237 --> 19:07.942
even though sometimes
you think you can.

19:09.108 --> 19:12.214
"And I know that's why you
made the decision you made.

19:12.278 --> 19:14.883
"Believe me, Blanche,
I understand."

19:15.615 --> 19:19.189
"Nobody could expect you to hang
around the rest of your life,"

19:19.253 --> 19:22.994
"waiting for someone like Luther
Gillis to change his stripes."

19:24.425 --> 19:28.533
"So, I wish you the best of luck.
No hard feelings."

19:29.864 --> 19:33.738
"But I guess I'll always
love you. Luther."

19:55.225 --> 19:56.227
Not me.

20:04.569 --> 20:05.771
Higgins.

20:12.244 --> 20:13.279
What's going on?

20:13.345 --> 20:15.383
Somebody just tried to kill me.

20:22.742 --> 20:24.846
Names of known enemies. None.

20:24.906 --> 20:26.142
You have no enemies?

20:26.208 --> 20:29.047
None that I can think
of at the moment, no.

20:32.247 --> 20:33.883
List all the people
you owe money to.

20:33.949 --> 20:35.852
All of my accounts are current.

20:35.918 --> 20:37.688
Well, list all the people
you currently owe money to?

20:37.753 --> 20:38.856
None.

20:45.829 --> 20:51.240
Any romantic dalliances
with perhaps the wrong woman?

20:51.302 --> 20:53.205
Mr. Gillie, please!

20:53.270 --> 20:56.343
I'm sorry! These questions
have to be asked.

20:56.941 --> 20:59.947
Murder investigation
is not always pretty.

21:00.012 --> 21:01.715
If you don't mind.

21:01.780 --> 21:04.251
What do you suppose is taking
the big guy so long, anyway?

21:04.317 --> 21:05.519
There are a lot
of grounds to cover.

21:05.584 --> 21:07.220
The assassin could
still be out there.

21:07.286 --> 21:09.690
I'm certain Magnum
is proceeding with caution.

21:09.756 --> 21:11.693
Just one last question.

21:14.127 --> 21:16.265
Is this absolutely necessary?

21:16.896 --> 21:18.566
If you are Robin Masters...

21:18.631 --> 21:19.800
Who told you that?

21:19.867 --> 21:22.505
Why don't you just say so
and end this silly charade?

21:22.569 --> 21:24.038
Because I'm not.

21:24.104 --> 21:26.442
Well, why doesn't the real
Robin show up and prove it?

21:26.507 --> 21:28.143
What on earth does this
have to do with the fact

21:28.209 --> 21:30.647
that someone just tried
to take my life?

21:31.445 --> 21:32.748
Just curious.

21:32.814 --> 21:34.082
Unless...

21:36.152 --> 21:38.356
Why didn't I see this before?

22:18.564 --> 22:19.632
Magnum!

22:19.698 --> 22:20.779
Higgins! What are you doing?

22:21.868 --> 22:23.404
I thought you were inside.

22:23.470 --> 22:25.707
The security panel showed
the front gate was open.

22:25.772 --> 22:28.110
I wanted to see if it was forced.
I thought you were in the study.

22:28.175 --> 22:29.710
I had a theory.

22:40.722 --> 22:43.359
It looks like it didn't completely
close after someone left.

22:43.426 --> 22:44.828
Precisely.

22:46.295 --> 22:47.697
Shh.

22:47.763 --> 22:49.868
It must be the wind.
He's long gone by now.

22:49.932 --> 22:50.967
He?

22:51.033 --> 22:53.237
Bruce Kunkle. I realized after
you left that he is the only one

22:53.302 --> 22:55.240
who could possibly
have shot at me.

22:55.305 --> 22:56.825
I checked his room.
Everything is gone.

22:56.839 --> 22:59.277
His clothes, his books.
Everything.

23:49.630 --> 23:52.369
After our discussion
this afternoon,

23:53.168 --> 23:56.441
I discovered a discrepancy
on the books.

23:59.075 --> 24:01.747
A $20,OOO discrepancy.

24:06.517 --> 24:09.289
Bruce made a $20,OOO mistake?

24:09.353 --> 24:11.290
I don't think it was a mistake.

24:11.355 --> 24:13.358
My first thought was that
he stole the manuscript

24:13.425 --> 24:16.964
to ransom it and replace the money
before I came across the entry.

24:17.027 --> 24:19.232
Did you talk to him about it?

24:20.098 --> 24:21.701
Well, I was going to.
It was late.

24:21.766 --> 24:26.074
I didn't quite know what to say.
The lad has been with me...

24:26.872 --> 24:29.611
With Mr. Masters'
that is, for 10 years.

24:29.674 --> 24:31.277
He's a very gifted
young accountant.

24:31.344 --> 24:35.653
I just thought that perhaps in the
morning things would look different.

24:37.217 --> 24:38.452
Any luck?

24:39.353 --> 24:40.421
Maybe.

24:40.487 --> 24:42.324
Looks like we got
a matching set.

24:42.389 --> 24:44.527
I found this shell casing
out on the windows.

24:44.591 --> 24:47.596
Ten millimeter automatic.
Bren Ten, probably.

24:47.661 --> 24:48.930
Or a Colt Super Elite.

24:48.997 --> 24:50.734
Possibly. Definitely.

24:50.798 --> 24:52.735
How can you know that for sure?

24:53.502 --> 24:54.770
I just do.

24:54.836 --> 24:56.239
This is great!

24:56.305 --> 24:57.840
An honest to God case.

24:57.906 --> 25:00.979
Not 24 hours after
I drop anchor on this rock.

25:01.877 --> 25:03.747
And attempted murder at that.

25:03.812 --> 25:06.717
Who said the old lucky streak
is running out?

25:07.317 --> 25:08.920
Any suspects?

25:08.985 --> 25:11.890
Oh, no, we can't call the police yet.
I know his family.

25:11.955 --> 25:14.627
We have to at least try
to find him ourselves first.

25:14.691 --> 25:16.528
If this guy is
trying to kill you...

25:16.594 --> 25:20.568
I know where the next attempt will be.
I'll be careful. 24 hours.

25:20.898 --> 25:25.006
As Chuckie would say, "Why take
only 24 hours? Take a whole day!"

25:30.042 --> 25:34.016
All right. What have we got so far?
Motive. Opportunity. Weapon.

25:35.315 --> 25:37.619
Weapon, opportunity, motive.

25:38.284 --> 25:42.158
Once you get two out of three, wham!
You have nailed your guy.

25:42.789 --> 25:45.794
For example, I had this
case back in 1963.

25:46.159 --> 25:47.439
Had to do with
the transportation

25:47.494 --> 25:49.899
of illegal cans of peanut
butter across state lines...

25:49.964 --> 25:51.166
Peanut butter?

25:51.231 --> 25:53.068
It's a long story.
At any rate...

25:53.133 --> 25:55.838
Well, why can't you tell us about
the case you're working on now?

25:55.903 --> 25:59.911
Sorry, little lady. That is rule
number two in the Pl handbook.

26:00.508 --> 26:03.413
Never discuss your
current case with anyone.

26:04.112 --> 26:07.385
I don't suppose either one
of you have read my book,

26:07.650 --> 26:09.687
So You Want To Be a Pl?

26:10.953 --> 26:13.390
Let me give you
a thumbnail sketch.

26:13.456 --> 26:16.229
So you think Bruce is trying to kill
Higgins because he thinks he's Robin?

26:16.293 --> 26:17.962
Will you quit
spreading that rumor?

26:18.028 --> 26:20.833
Me? You're the one that started it.
Now you don't believe it anymore?

26:20.897 --> 26:23.334
I didn't say I don't believe it.

26:23.400 --> 26:25.872
It's probably true.
I'm not 100O_ sure.

26:25.936 --> 26:27.673
Will you forget about that
for a minute?

26:27.738 --> 26:29.508
Well, it does
kind of make sense.

26:29.574 --> 26:31.344
Higgins being Robin
and Bruce kills him...

26:31.409 --> 26:33.981
Rick. Then he doesn't have to
pay him any of the money back,

26:34.045 --> 26:35.648
and nobody ever knows the wiser.
Come on, Rick!

26:35.713 --> 26:37.817
Will you just see what
you can do to find him!

26:37.882 --> 26:39.252
You could count on it, pally.

26:39.318 --> 26:42.658
Nobody's going to take pot shots
at Higgins and get away with it.

26:45.024 --> 26:47.529
You know, you and Cleo,

26:47.594 --> 26:51.301
you've been seeing a lot of
each other lately, haven't you?

26:52.932 --> 26:55.737
Thomas, while I'm looking for Bruce,
what are you going to be doing?

26:55.802 --> 26:59.509
I've got a lead on Kauai. All
I have to do is hitch a ride.

26:59.907 --> 27:01.209
No!

27:01.842 --> 27:03.411
Absolutely not.

27:04.011 --> 27:06.181
You know Bryant and I
are going scuba diving today.

27:06.248 --> 27:10.055
You've known for a week. Now, you do not
have to make this trip right this second.

27:10.118 --> 27:12.857
T.C., there are certain
priorities in life.

27:12.921 --> 27:15.760
And one of them happens to be
spending more time with my son,

27:15.824 --> 27:18.129
which is above running errands
for Thomas Magnum.

27:18.194 --> 27:22.035
Exactly! And maybe above that
or certainly to the side of it

27:22.098 --> 27:24.268
is helping a friend
whose life is in danger.

27:24.333 --> 27:27.105
All set, Dad. I think
I've got everything.

27:27.471 --> 27:28.706
Great.

27:29.406 --> 27:31.009
We can put all the stuff
in the van.

27:31.075 --> 27:32.544
We still going?

27:32.843 --> 27:34.580
Yeah, yeah, come on.

27:34.646 --> 27:36.649
I'm going to show you ahi
or na'ena'a or paki'i

27:36.714 --> 27:38.651
in their natural state
right out there in the ocean.

27:38.716 --> 27:40.653
I thought Rick
was gonna help you!

27:40.718 --> 27:42.989
Well, he is,
but I just got this hunch

27:43.054 --> 27:45.191
that we can get more information
from the messenger service

27:45.256 --> 27:46.592
than he can from Bruce Kunkle.

27:47.726 --> 27:48.828
I'll get it.

27:48.893 --> 27:52.133
And you could call the
messenger service on the phone

27:52.198 --> 27:55.772
to find out if they hired someone to
pick up the manuscript from Higgins.

27:55.835 --> 27:56.870
My son needs me.

27:56.936 --> 28:01.011
T.C., you know that they are not going
to give that kind of information

28:01.074 --> 28:03.546
to a total stranger
on the phone.

28:03.611 --> 28:05.681
Oh, and they're going to
give it to you in person?

28:05.746 --> 28:07.983
Mr. Magnum? It's for you.

28:09.183 --> 28:10.785
It's Mr. Wright.

28:12.353 --> 28:13.756
Yeah, Rick, any luck?

28:13.821 --> 28:14.989
Yeah, you could say that.

28:15.457 --> 28:18.696
Apparently he tied one on last night
after his fight with Higgins.

28:18.760 --> 28:21.800
He was booked for
disorderly conduct at 12:15.

28:21.864 --> 28:24.335
An hour before
Higgins was shot at?

28:24.399 --> 28:27.606
Yeah. And he spent the rest of the
night as the guest of the county.

28:27.670 --> 28:30.977
This is very embarrassing.
I graduated third in my class.

28:31.040 --> 28:33.010
You're sure
he was there all night?

28:33.910 --> 28:35.847
That's what I said.

28:35.912 --> 28:37.682
I got the paperwork to prove it.

28:37.748 --> 28:38.783
Thanks, Rick.

28:38.848 --> 28:40.484
Hey, what's next?

28:45.222 --> 28:46.792
This is really great.

28:46.857 --> 28:48.360
Dad says every time
he helps you out,

28:48.426 --> 28:49.895
you get into
all kinds of trouble.

28:49.961 --> 28:52.265
People shooting
at you and stuff.

28:52.330 --> 28:55.804
That's a lot more fun than looking
at a bunch of old fish underwater.

28:55.867 --> 28:57.737
People shooting at us?

28:58.069 --> 28:59.973
There's only one thing
I don't understand.

29:00.039 --> 29:02.143
Why would anybody be trying
to kill Mr. Higgins?

29:02.208 --> 29:05.682
Because someone with a big mouth
ran around telling everybody

29:05.746 --> 29:07.549
that Higgins was Robin Masters.

29:07.614 --> 29:10.988
, T.C., first of all I didn't
tell that many people.

29:11.051 --> 29:12.520
Who'd believe something
like that, anyway?

29:12.586 --> 29:14.590
Well, it's not really
that far-fetched.

29:14.656 --> 29:17.228
Robin Masters, the guy who
writes all the books?

29:17.292 --> 29:18.694
The guy Mr. Higgins works for?

29:18.760 --> 29:19.895
Yeah.

29:20.829 --> 29:23.366
Boy, you'd have to be
pretty dense to believe that.

29:36.045 --> 29:37.415
Thank you.

29:38.582 --> 29:39.583
Any luck?

29:39.649 --> 29:41.920
I think so. We got to get back!

29:57.502 --> 29:59.806
Yes, yes.
Of course, I understand.

29:59.871 --> 30:02.576
I'll be there within
the half hour. Thank you.

30:08.947 --> 30:10.150
Robin's Nest.

30:10.216 --> 30:11.786
Hi. Oh, Magnum.

30:11.852 --> 30:13.287
Have you found Bruce Kunkle?

30:13.353 --> 30:14.556
Yes, but Higgins, I...

30:14.622 --> 30:16.559
Where is the manuscript?

30:16.624 --> 30:17.692
I don't know, but, Higgins...

30:17.758 --> 30:19.461
I can't put Miss Donaldson
off any longer.

30:19.526 --> 30:21.296
I must go to her
hotel immediately.

30:21.362 --> 30:22.397
No, wait.

30:22.463 --> 30:25.368
I'll simply tell her the truth
and throw myself on her mercy.

30:25.433 --> 30:27.102
Higgins, if you'd just
give me a chance.

30:27.167 --> 30:28.803
I'm afraid I've run out of time.

30:28.870 --> 30:29.905
Higgins! No!

30:41.083 --> 30:42.953
Wait, wait, Mr. Higgins.

30:44.320 --> 30:46.825
Mr. Higgins. I need to talk to you.
It's about the books. I made a mistake.

30:46.890 --> 30:49.061
We'll have to discuss
the books later.

30:49.126 --> 30:50.561
Mr. Higgins!

31:12.084 --> 31:13.453
Oh, my God.

31:42.317 --> 31:43.352
There he is.

32:37.962 --> 32:43.373
Requesting an ambulance on Round Top
Road between Kapona and Lookout Point.

32:44.602 --> 32:45.771
Roger.

32:49.278 --> 32:51.416
Come on. Here,
now, take it easy.

32:51.476 --> 32:54.215
Come on. Are you all right?
Take it easy.

32:55.882 --> 32:57.517
Take it easy.

32:57.583 --> 32:59.787
Someone sabotaged the brakes.

32:59.852 --> 33:00.887
T.C♪ s calling for help.

33:00.953 --> 33:02.021
I knew better.

33:02.089 --> 33:03.090
You knew better what?

33:03.157 --> 33:07.265
The car, this road.
Still, it was the fastest way.

33:07.327 --> 33:10.132
You said before you knew where the
second attempt was going to take place.

33:10.197 --> 33:11.800
Malcolm MacDonald. Who?

33:13.234 --> 33:15.638
Higgins, who is
Malcolm MacDonald?

33:16.403 --> 33:17.906
He passed out.

33:17.972 --> 33:19.942
I called the paramedics.

33:20.675 --> 33:23.247
Did he say who the lady is who
hired the messenger service?

33:23.312 --> 33:25.582
I didn't get a chance to ask
him. But I think I know who.

33:25.647 --> 33:27.651
Who? Malcolm MacDonald.

33:27.717 --> 33:29.620
Who on earth
is Malcolm MacDonald?

33:31.787 --> 33:34.994
Chuckie was on the main gate.
I was on the back gate.

33:35.058 --> 33:39.367
And Blanche,
this other operative...

33:39.963 --> 33:43.236
Blanche, she was on
the horn to the coppers.

33:43.301 --> 33:45.405
You know,
these are really terrific.

33:45.469 --> 33:46.905
Did you invent them?

33:46.971 --> 33:48.641
To tell the truth,
my secretary...

33:48.706 --> 33:54.017
I mean, my ex-secretary had come up with
some of the ingredients. But I named it.

33:54.079 --> 33:56.516
You know, Mr. Higgins has sure
been gone a long time, huh?

33:56.581 --> 33:59.421
Who, the butler?
Don't worry about him.

34:00.119 --> 34:03.292
As long as he knows that Luther H.
Gillie is on the case,

34:03.356 --> 34:05.861
this place is as safe
as Fort Knox.

34:06.926 --> 34:10.900
Anyway, there we were,
me, Chuckie, Blanche...

34:11.364 --> 34:14.036
Have you ever met
Robin Masters personally?

34:14.101 --> 34:15.303
Me? You kidding?

34:15.369 --> 34:16.404
Uh-uh.

34:16.469 --> 34:20.377
Where do you think he gets all his
research material for his books?

34:20.442 --> 34:21.944
From you?

34:22.009 --> 34:23.312
Certainly.

34:23.378 --> 34:24.914
Wow.

34:24.980 --> 34:27.652
You really lead an exciting
and glamorous life.

34:27.716 --> 34:28.751
Yeah, well...

34:28.817 --> 34:32.224
You know, I would give anything
to meet Robin Masters.

34:32.288 --> 34:35.594
Do you know that I have read
every one of his books?

34:35.992 --> 34:37.194
Really?

34:37.559 --> 34:39.931
I can even act out
some of my favorite scenes.

34:39.996 --> 34:45.440
Yeah? Well
maybe latei on tonight.

34:45.501 --> 34:46.971
After we meet Robin?

34:47.036 --> 34:48.806
Of course after we meet Robin.

34:48.871 --> 34:50.641
You mean it?
Of course I mean it.

34:50.706 --> 34:54.781
I don't believe this. I mean, I
actually get to meet Robin Masters.

34:55.213 --> 34:58.319
I mean, you have no idea
what this means to me.

34:58.883 --> 35:01.421
Sure. You can tell
me about it later.

35:01.753 --> 35:03.523
Right now,
I've got some work to do.

35:03.588 --> 35:08.899
And you should buy
yourself something nice,

35:09.728 --> 35:11.331
something green.

35:11.398 --> 35:13.368
It's his favorite color.

35:13.732 --> 35:15.735
OO.

35:16.369 --> 35:20.444
You know, you are probably one
of the nicest men I've ever met.

35:22.276 --> 35:23.478
Thanks.

35:41.364 --> 35:44.002
- Don't forget.
- OO.

35:44.067 --> 35:45.135
Okay.

36:22.342 --> 36:24.546
One other thing
about transitions.

36:24.610 --> 36:28.284
Sometimes you get so caught up in the
changes going on in your own life,

36:28.348 --> 36:30.653
you don't even notice
that the people around you

36:30.717 --> 36:32.720
are going through
changes themselves.

36:40.161 --> 36:44.770
But once you do notice, the best thing
to do is just stop for a minute,

36:46.201 --> 36:48.171
and give your friends
a little help.

36:48.237 --> 36:49.907
Because when you do that,

36:49.972 --> 36:53.879
your own problems seem to have a
way of working themselves out.

36:54.277 --> 36:58.351
And even if they don't, at least it
reminds you that you're not the only one

36:58.415 --> 37:00.753
who's trying to sort things out.

38:46.634 --> 38:49.373
Okay, Luther.
You can come out now.

38:52.940 --> 38:54.743
This is not what it looks like.
I know.

38:54.809 --> 38:56.445
I'm here for one reason
and one reason only.

38:56.511 --> 38:57.613
I know.

38:57.680 --> 38:59.650
On the trail of a suspect who...

38:59.715 --> 39:00.750
You know?

39:00.816 --> 39:04.056
What else would a world class investigator
be doing in a beautiful woman's hotel room

39:04.120 --> 39:05.322
but investigating?

39:05.388 --> 39:06.423
Right.

39:06.489 --> 39:09.495
This time I think we hit
pay dirt, the mother lode.

39:09.560 --> 39:12.499
Your suspect is none
other than Suzi Merrill.

39:12.795 --> 39:14.365
Motive, revenge.

39:14.998 --> 39:18.471
There are some interesting little letters
that go along with these manuscripts.

39:18.535 --> 39:23.111
"Too close in style and substance to
Robin Masters' To Die and Die Again."

39:23.708 --> 39:28.451
"Regret to inform you, your style is too
similar to our author Robin Masters."

39:29.080 --> 39:31.852
One reiection letter
for each manuscript.

39:32.418 --> 39:36.927
I guess she bought your ridiculous theory
about the butler being Robin Masters,

39:36.989 --> 39:38.592
and figured with him
out of the way,

39:38.658 --> 39:41.095
she'd have a better chance to
get her own books published.

39:41.160 --> 39:44.901
Especially if she submitted.

39:44.965 --> 39:48.237
Robin's latest effort
under her own name.

39:50.438 --> 39:55.047
You know, Luther, for a minute I thought
you set the whole thing up yourself.

39:55.109 --> 39:56.578
Me? Why?

39:57.178 --> 39:58.413
Oh, I don't know.

39:58.479 --> 40:02.521
Maybe to solve the case and convince a
certain secretary, and maybe even yourself,

40:02.584 --> 40:05.356
that you hadn't
lost the old touch.

40:05.420 --> 40:07.056
You think that would work?

40:07.122 --> 40:10.629
I think telling her how you
feel would work a lot better.

40:10.859 --> 40:11.961
Nah.

40:18.201 --> 40:20.839
Hey, you know, I think the
guys are all wrong about you.

40:20.904 --> 40:22.307
You're not half bad.

40:22.373 --> 40:23.508
Thanks.

40:23.574 --> 40:27.315
The only thing we have to do now is
find Suzi before she finds the butler.

40:27.378 --> 40:30.217
That's easy. I think
we'll find her in here.

40:30.448 --> 40:31.683
Where?

41:02.216 --> 41:03.786
I knew you'd come up here.

41:03.851 --> 41:06.958
You just had to take the chance
to get your manuscript back.

41:07.021 --> 41:11.162
Well, this time Chapter 3 is going
to end a little differently.

41:11.727 --> 41:15.201
The world-famous novelist doesn't
get his precious book back.

41:15.264 --> 41:16.699
Suzi, no. I can't let you do it.

41:16.765 --> 41:18.970
Look, I told you to stay out of
the way until this was over.

41:19.034 --> 41:22.474
I can't let you do this. Not to Mr.
Higgins, even if he is Robin Masters.

41:22.539 --> 41:24.409
Which, I assure you, I'm not.

41:24.474 --> 41:25.509
Luther!

41:25.575 --> 41:27.312
Sorry, doll. The party's over.

41:27.377 --> 41:30.282
I'm turning you and the manuscript
you stole over to the police.

41:30.347 --> 41:31.416
How did you get the...

41:31.482 --> 41:34.421
You shouldn't leave your hand
bag hanging around unattended.

41:34.485 --> 41:37.090
Some snoopy Pl might
borrow your keys.

41:37.455 --> 41:39.693
I don't believe
that's Robin's book.

41:39.758 --> 41:40.793
No?

41:41.660 --> 41:45.801
"Veronica shivered in the cool night
air, only her thoughts of revenge,"

41:45.864 --> 41:50.406
"and the Colt Super Elite she held in her
shaking right hand to keep her warm."

41:50.470 --> 41:53.174
You just signed your
own death warrant, Gillie.

41:53.239 --> 41:54.774
Oh, I don't think so, Suzi.

41:54.841 --> 41:56.544
Mr. Magnum!

41:57.310 --> 41:58.780
Sorry, Bruce.

41:59.613 --> 42:02.418
I had to find out whether
you were in on it or not.

42:02.483 --> 42:04.286
We can still turn
ourselves in, Suzi.

42:04.351 --> 42:05.853
Throw ourselves on
the mercy of the court.

42:05.919 --> 42:08.457
We can wait for each other
until after we're out of jail.

42:08.522 --> 42:12.430
Bruce, you really should have
read Chapter 4 of Robin's book.

42:12.927 --> 42:15.265
That's where Veronica kills
the young man she conned

42:15.330 --> 42:17.634
into getting her
into the estate.

42:17.699 --> 42:19.402
Look, don't listen to him.

42:19.467 --> 42:21.070
Once they're out of the way
and we have the manuscript,

42:21.136 --> 42:23.006
we can do everything
just like we planned.

42:23.071 --> 42:26.711
We can travel, live like kings.
Just like Robin Masters.

42:26.776 --> 42:28.613
Come on, baby.
Just get the manuscript.

42:28.679 --> 42:32.453
You want the manuscript? Why
didn't you say so? Here you go.

42:32.949 --> 42:34.285
Suzi!

43:02.582 --> 43:06.056
Let go of it, Suzi.
Grab hold of my hand.

43:10.791 --> 43:12.226
Let go of it.

43:18.199 --> 43:20.704
A classic case
of art versus life.

43:21.102 --> 43:25.678
Well, perhaps the novel she'll write
in jail will be her chance at success.

43:27.109 --> 43:29.513
This is going to make doing the
monthly books a bit awkward

43:29.578 --> 43:31.582
with Bruce incarcerated.

43:31.848 --> 43:35.422
Still, I suppose we'll make
the best of a bad situation.

43:35.818 --> 43:40.862
Oh, by the way, Luther said to
wish you a speedy recovery.

43:40.924 --> 43:45.066
He's on his way back to St. Louis to
convince Blanche not to marry someone else.

43:45.129 --> 43:46.464
Indeed.

43:50.501 --> 43:55.178
How did you know to check the manuscript
to see where Suzi would show up next?

43:56.041 --> 43:57.243
Oh...

43:59.310 --> 44:01.782
Some of the things
you said, Higgins,

44:02.481 --> 44:07.190
about the gun,
about the brake linings,

44:07.586 --> 44:09.423
about Malcolm MacDonald.

44:09.488 --> 44:10.891
Malcolm MacDonald?

44:10.957 --> 44:13.127
The hero in Transitions.

44:13.192 --> 44:18.570
See, I figured that Suzi
had to be absolutely certain

44:18.632 --> 44:21.170
she was killing Robin Masters,

44:21.234 --> 44:24.808
so she staged the endings
of Chapter 1 and Chapter 2

44:24.872 --> 44:28.714
hoping to lure the one person
who knew the book

44:28.777 --> 44:31.482
to where the murder attempt was
going to take place in Chapter 3.

44:31.547 --> 44:34.051
And there's only one person that
had that knowledge, Higgins,

44:34.116 --> 44:36.154
the man who wrote the book.

44:37.419 --> 44:38.855
Astonishing.

44:39.154 --> 44:43.161
I never cease to be amazed at the
convoluted way your mind works.

44:43.660 --> 44:49.304
Just because I surreptitiously read Mr.
Masters' manuscript, doesn't mean I wrote it.

44:49.700 --> 44:51.235
Sure, Higgins.

44:55.206 --> 44:58.278
I can't believe the
manuscript is lost forever.

44:59.878 --> 45:06.224
Well, hopefully, when Robin
sits down at his tape recorder

45:06.284 --> 45:09.691
and starts over,
it'll be better this time.

45:09.755 --> 45:11.390
Yes. Perhaps so.

45:12.859 --> 45:15.898
You know, I was thinking, the fourth
chapter has always been a little weak.

45:15.962 --> 45:17.498
Oh, aren't they always?

45:17.563 --> 45:19.968
And the turnaround
in Chapter 6...

45:24.838 --> 45:26.441
