- Do not remove the
ancient landmark

00:26.583 --> 00:28.875
nor enter the fields
of the fatherless

00:28.875 --> 00:32.000
for their redeemer is mighty,

00:32.000 --> 00:33.750
He will plead their
cause against you.

00:33.750 --> 00:34.834
Oh Lord yes.

00:41.625 --> 00:43.917
- Look at there.

00:45.875 --> 00:47.083
Look at that.

00:47.792 --> 00:49.208
Here we go again.

00:54.750 --> 00:58.417
I don't know if, oh
there's the truck there.

00:58.417 --> 01:01.000
They're starting to come, okay.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.834
Oh another day, another day.

01:09.208 --> 01:11.959
A little child is
out there screaming.

01:11.959 --> 01:13.458
That is unreal.

01:13.458 --> 01:16.917
They have children saying
that you're a murderer.

01:16.917 --> 01:19.083
They got a violin player.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.250
So here we go again, another
day, another day with them.

01:27.166 --> 01:31.083
- If you're pregnant please
take and read this information.

01:31.083 --> 01:34.041
Mommy, Mommy please
don't kill me Mommy.

01:34.041 --> 01:36.291
Mommy I have a dream Mommy.

01:39.250 --> 01:41.458
- Why would I do that,
this way too easy Roy.

01:41.458 --> 01:43.542
- [Child] Stop
killing your baby!

01:43.542 --> 01:45.500
In the end there
will be judgment!

01:46.375 --> 01:48.875
- [Shannon] Baby I'm
not, I'm not pregnant.

01:48.875 --> 01:50.250
I'm not pregnant baby.

01:50.250 --> 01:54.000
- [Child] Please
don't kill your baby!

01:54.000 --> 01:56.917
- Miss the baby
doesn't want to die.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.291
Please listen to the
word of the Lord.

01:58.291 --> 01:59.417
- [Shannon] They teach
the little children.

01:59.417 --> 02:04.834
They got these little
bitty children saying this.

02:04.834 --> 02:06.625
- First thing we
want people to know,

02:06.625 --> 02:08.125
it's bad for the women.

02:08.125 --> 02:11.834
And then secondly,
and very importantly,

02:11.834 --> 02:15.125
there are free centers that are

02:15.125 --> 02:17.417
called Crisis Pregnancy Centers.

02:17.417 --> 02:19.458
We help them, stay with
them, we assign people

02:19.458 --> 02:21.917
to them like a mentor.

02:21.917 --> 02:24.417
Ma'am do the right thing please.

02:26.750 --> 02:28.792
Please do the right thing.

02:29.667 --> 02:31.875
You talk to them while I
go talk to these people.

02:31.875 --> 02:33.750
If you're about 10 weeks this is

02:33.750 --> 02:36.667
the size of your little baby.

02:36.667 --> 02:40.959
So y'all, y'all are pregnant
and decided not to abort right?

02:45.166 --> 02:48.291
(contemplative music)

03:07.375 --> 03:08.250
- [Dr. Parker] Good morning.

03:08.250 --> 03:09.041
- [Patient Group]
Hi, how are you?

03:09.041 --> 03:10.375
- I'm Dr. Parker.

03:10.375 --> 03:11.583
I'm one of the doctors who
work here at the clinic.

03:11.583 --> 03:15.083
The state requires us to do
some very specific things.

03:15.083 --> 03:16.166
But I think some
of the information

03:16.166 --> 03:17.875
I'm required to
tell you is designed

03:17.875 --> 03:21.166
to kind of discourage from
deciding to have an abortion.

03:21.166 --> 03:23.583
First of all the state
requires me to tell you

03:23.583 --> 03:25.542
that there's a risk of bleeding,

03:25.542 --> 03:26.583
there's a risk of infection,

03:26.583 --> 03:29.208
there's a risk of damage
to any of your organs.

03:29.208 --> 03:31.708
Now guess what all of
those complications

03:31.708 --> 03:34.125
are also associated
with having childbirth.

03:34.125 --> 03:35.291
The thing that I
have the most problem

03:35.291 --> 03:37.083
with having to tell you but
I'm required to tell you

03:37.083 --> 03:38.875
is that by having
an abortion it might

03:38.875 --> 03:41.166
increase your risk
for breast cancer.

03:41.166 --> 03:42.834
There's no scientific
evidence that abortion

03:42.834 --> 03:44.542
increases your risk
for breast cancer.

03:44.542 --> 03:46.500
I can't say enough
this is your decision.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.542
This is not anything you
have to be ashamed of.

03:48.542 --> 03:50.917
Disregard those
people out there.

03:50.917 --> 03:51.625
They know nothing
about your life.

03:51.625 --> 03:53.250
They know nothing about you.

03:53.250 --> 03:56.333
This is healthcare and
we're here to make sure that

03:56.333 --> 04:00.041
you can have safe, legal
access to abortion.

04:00.041 --> 04:04.208
And that's your choice and
that's your right to do that.

04:11.166 --> 04:12.208
- Yeah the police
jus told them that

04:12.208 --> 04:13.542
they had to get those signs off,

04:13.542 --> 04:15.250
because they gonna
tell me they don't have

04:15.250 --> 04:16.916
to move the signs,
something about a line.

04:16.916 --> 04:19.458
What does the ground have
to do with our fence?

04:19.458 --> 04:23.708
This is our fence, you
cannot prop it on our fence.

04:25.500 --> 04:26.542
- [Ms. Esther] Pride
goes before destruction,

04:26.542 --> 04:29.375
and a haughty spirit
before a fall.

04:34.667 --> 04:36.083
- Nope, nope, the police
just told them Ms. Esther

04:36.083 --> 04:38.583
that they cannot, they have to

04:38.583 --> 04:39.792
take everyone of
these signs down.

04:39.792 --> 04:40.417
- [Ms. Esther] No it's
on public property.

04:40.417 --> 04:41.834
- [Shannon] No it's not.

04:41.834 --> 04:42.625
- [Ms. Esther] I know that the--

04:42.625 --> 04:43.417
- Let me ask, why was nothing

04:43.417 --> 04:44.375
said when the police were here?

04:44.375 --> 04:45.542
- [Ms. Esther] We
had a few more.

04:45.542 --> 04:48.083
- No no, the police made
them move every one of them.

04:48.083 --> 04:49.000
They moved every sign I
was standing right out--

04:49.000 --> 04:50.083
- No.
- Yes they did.

04:50.083 --> 04:51.166
- I put them right here.

04:51.166 --> 04:52.458
- No that was
afterwards Ms. Esther.

04:52.458 --> 04:53.250
- No it was not.

04:53.250 --> 04:53.959
- It was afterwards.

04:53.959 --> 04:55.417
- When Major Mcgallen was there.

04:55.417 --> 04:56.333
- When he was here they moved.
- You're just trying to--

04:56.333 --> 04:57.291
- No I'm not, y'all
trying to, y'all,

04:57.291 --> 04:58.750
well don't talk to me Ms. Esther

04:58.750 --> 05:00.291
'cause y'all trying
to cause difficulty.

05:00.291 --> 05:01.291
- I know what the
public sidewalk is

05:01.291 --> 05:03.959
because the line
is right over here.

05:03.959 --> 05:06.041
Come and look at the line.

05:10.792 --> 05:12.208
- It's crazy ain't it?

05:12.208 --> 05:14.625
Yeah, she'll be
out there all day.

05:14.625 --> 05:18.542
But she's hungry, she's
tired, she's thirsty.

05:18.542 --> 05:20.417
But she's not leaving.

05:21.417 --> 05:24.542
She'll pass out before she
leave and miss something.

05:24.542 --> 05:25.792
See that, you saw that truck?

05:25.792 --> 05:29.041
Yeah that means they're
getting ready to come back in.

05:29.041 --> 05:33.125
(contemplative music)

05:38.000 --> 05:39.375
- [Radio] The Supreme Court
has made it very clear

05:39.375 --> 05:42.166
that is not going to
overturn Roe versus Wade.

05:42.166 --> 05:43.917
You're seeing efforts
in this state to see

05:43.917 --> 05:44.667
how far they can
take it short of

05:44.667 --> 05:47.583
restricting abortion outright.

05:49.166 --> 05:51.000
- [Radio] The GOP is waging war

05:51.000 --> 05:53.792
on women at the
grass roots level.

05:53.792 --> 05:56.333
Five states have
only one clinic left.

05:56.333 --> 05:59.458
These attacks are
creating a situation

05:59.458 --> 06:02.417
where abortion is
legal in America,

06:02.417 --> 06:05.458
and in some places
impossible to get.

06:06.417 --> 06:09.500
(contemplative music)

06:39.959 --> 06:40.708
- [Barbara] Hello there.

06:40.708 --> 06:41.583
- [Man] Hello, how are you?

06:41.583 --> 06:43.208
- I'm Barbara Beavers,
I'm the Director

06:43.208 --> 06:46.208
at the Pregnancy Care
Center here in Jackson.

06:46.208 --> 06:49.208
We love y'all, y'all
are doing good.

06:49.208 --> 06:54.125
You're doing what you can do
and we're very very grateful.

06:54.125 --> 06:56.542
I know, does that make sense?

06:57.542 --> 07:00.417
Listen to what I, the
Lord told me this morning.

07:00.417 --> 07:02.834
You know we go and we
do abstinence education,

07:02.834 --> 07:05.875
and so we give these kids these
suckers that say Dum Dums.

07:05.875 --> 07:08.583
And we say don't be a
dumb dumb, save sex.

07:08.583 --> 07:11.208
We say don't be a dumb
dumb, save sex for marriage.

07:11.208 --> 07:13.542
But I thought today I could
say don't be a dumb dumb,

07:13.542 --> 07:15.834
you don't solve a problem
by killing a baby.

07:15.834 --> 07:18.083
- Absolutely 100%
right, I agree with you.

07:18.083 --> 07:19.875
- You hear me?

07:19.875 --> 07:20.625
- I agree with you.

07:20.625 --> 07:21.708
- Well good, who are you?

07:21.708 --> 07:23.792
- I'm Randy Boyd, District 19.

07:23.792 --> 07:25.000
- Randy Boyd,

07:25.000 --> 07:25.917
District--

07:25.917 --> 07:27.250
- [Man] 28.

07:27.250 --> 07:28.542
- 28, Cleveland.

07:30.875 --> 07:34.750
Good, take a handful,
and don't be a dumb dumb.

07:35.750 --> 07:38.291
We're not gonna solve it
by killing our babies.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.291
- That's right.

07:39.291 --> 07:40.875
- We're gonna
solve it by finding

07:40.875 --> 07:43.375
positive ways to
deal with the issue.

07:43.375 --> 07:44.250
- That's right.

07:44.250 --> 07:45.583
- God together.

07:45.583 --> 07:46.834
- We appreciate your efforts.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.250
- Well thank you.

07:48.250 --> 07:51.291
We appreciate y'all, we
appreciate, we got a great,

07:51.291 --> 07:54.792
come on we gonna do
something in Mississippi now.

07:54.792 --> 07:57.875
(contemplative music)

08:31.291 --> 08:34.750
(phone ringing)

08:34.750 --> 08:37.166
- CPC, how can I help you?

08:37.166 --> 08:40.542
(contemplative music)

08:46.041 --> 08:47.542
Okay, I can help you with that.

08:47.542 --> 08:50.166
Could I make an
appointment for you?

08:50.166 --> 08:52.166
- We're a life affirming agency.

08:52.166 --> 08:54.458
We want to affirm
the choice for life.

08:54.458 --> 08:57.500
And help them make
a choice for life.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.500
There's nothing life
affirming about abortion.

09:00.500 --> 09:04.500
You're deceiving
yourself if you say

09:04.500 --> 09:07.708
you can kill your baby
and it be good for you.

09:07.708 --> 09:10.583
That's just deception,
that's not true.

09:10.583 --> 09:14.875
It doesn't, it doesn't
register with reality.

09:14.875 --> 09:16.667
Mommas, women are
not made that way.

09:16.667 --> 09:20.917
Women are made to protect
and to guard and to,

09:20.917 --> 09:25.166
to die for their babies, not
their babies to die for them.

09:28.125 --> 09:29.875
And I say that with
tears in my eyes

09:29.875 --> 09:32.834
'cause one out of three
women have done that.

09:40.166 --> 09:41.959
- Hey.

09:41.959 --> 09:43.166
- [Receptionist]
Hey, how you doing?

09:43.166 --> 09:44.917
- I'm doing okay, I had an
appointment at two o'clock.

09:44.917 --> 09:47.250
- [Receptionist] Okay,
there's a pen right there.

09:47.250 --> 09:49.125
- [April] I put my name?

09:50.250 --> 09:52.417
Yes ma'am.

09:52.417 --> 09:56.250
- [Receptionist] Okay, I need
you to put sonogram over here.

09:59.041 --> 10:02.583
S-O-N-A, sona, that'll work.

10:07.500 --> 10:08.750
- I'm undecided see I
want to deliver babies,

10:08.750 --> 10:13.375
I want be a LP, a LPN,
or a Dental Associate.

10:14.583 --> 10:18.000
See I got so much I want to be.

10:18.875 --> 10:19.834
- You can just have a
seat right there please.

10:19.834 --> 10:23.250
Now I'm not a nurse,
and I'm not a doctor

10:23.250 --> 10:27.792
and so I don't diagnose or
confirm what I'm finding today.

10:27.792 --> 10:31.792
You ready for me to turn
on the big screen for you?

10:37.375 --> 10:38.792
This is your baby right here.

10:47.708 --> 10:50.125
You're seven weeks
and three days.

10:50.125 --> 10:54.291
Now I want to get you a picture
today, if you'd like one.

10:54.291 --> 10:56.291
Would you like a picture?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.708
You want one with hi Mom on it?

11:28.959 --> 11:32.041

that says God hates
the hands of a person

15:05.041 --> 15:08.333

- Good morning, good
morning, good morning.

16:06.959 --> 16:09.959
That guy was giving
me the business.

16:09.959 --> 16:13.083
I violated one of my own
rules again, I said that

16:15.083 --> 16:19.792
I was not going to
respond or say anything to

16:20.917 --> 16:23.166
those protestors but to me,

16:25.417 --> 16:28.542
it's particularly
bothersome that

16:28.542 --> 16:32.834
in order to make their point
there's nothing sacred for them

16:36.458 --> 16:37.208
Every morning when
I turn that corner

16:37.208 --> 16:38.875
and pull into that parking lot.

16:38.875 --> 16:40.750
- [Shannon] It's there.

16:40.750 --> 16:41.750
- My heart pumps a
little bit harder.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.125
- [Shannon] It's there,
it's always there.

16:43.125 --> 16:45.000
- Whenever I park that car,
whenever the security guy comes.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.542
- Always, whenever I pull up,

16:47.542 --> 16:48.959
I always kind of
sit for a second.

16:48.959 --> 16:50.583
I never just jump out the car.

16:50.583 --> 16:52.917
I always sit for a second,
I look back and forth.

16:52.917 --> 16:54.834
I'm like (takes deep
breath) okay, you know.

16:54.834 --> 16:57.000
But it's always there.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.667
It's somewhere in the
back of your head,

16:58.667 --> 17:01.417
you can't be inside
a facility like this

17:01.417 --> 17:03.834
and it not be
there all the time.

17:03.834 --> 17:05.333
It's always there.

17:10.500 --> 17:13.541
- [Dr. Parker] What are you
doing your masters work in?

17:13.541 --> 17:15.916
Doing the MSW, okay wonderful.

17:15.916 --> 17:18.250
You know for a lot of women,

17:20.708 --> 17:22.541
part of the decision is
taking care of your family

17:22.541 --> 17:26.000
and furthering your
career goals so that

17:27.083 --> 17:28.959
you can take care of
yourself and your family.

17:28.959 --> 17:30.291
So I don't know
why that's so hard

17:30.291 --> 17:33.333
for other folk to understand.

17:33.333 --> 17:36.625
Some of the people who judge you

17:36.625 --> 17:37.708
and try and stand in
you way from making

17:37.708 --> 17:41.333
this very important
decision would have a fit

17:41.333 --> 17:45.208
if someone tried to control
their lives in the same way.

17:45.208 --> 17:49.208
So lots of pressure, relax,
try and relax that muscle.

17:50.166 --> 17:51.375
(tube sucking air)

17:51.375 --> 17:55.041
We're almost done hang
in there, you doing okay?

17:55.041 --> 17:56.834
In the home stretch,
hang in there.

17:56.834 --> 17:59.875
(tube sucking air)

18:00.417 --> 18:04.000
(contemplative music)

18:08.041 --> 18:10.750
On Tuesday the
Taliban deliberately

18:10.750 --> 18:13.250
shot a 14 year
old Pakistani girl

18:13.250 --> 18:14.417
on her way home
from school because

18:14.417 --> 18:17.625
she was promoting
education for girls.

18:19.959 --> 18:22.291
Education creates
life chances for you.

18:22.291 --> 18:23.083
- [Shannon] That's right.

18:23.083 --> 18:25.500
- Unplanned, unwanted pregnancy

18:25.500 --> 18:26.917
diminishes life chances for you.

18:26.917 --> 18:28.166
- [Shannon] That's right.

18:28.166 --> 18:30.500
- You can kill a person,
or you can lock them

18:30.500 --> 18:33.125
into circumstances you make
them wish that they were dead.

18:33.125 --> 18:37.500
Unfortunately people
will hear that story,

18:38.250 --> 18:40.917
and think that it is more tragic

18:40.917 --> 18:43.750
than what happens to
women in Mississippi.

18:43.750 --> 18:45.500
I've been asked do
you think it's racist?

18:45.500 --> 18:49.333
It doesn't have to be racist
when the affect is the same,

18:49.333 --> 18:51.792
doesn't matter what
their motives are.

18:51.792 --> 18:54.291
The reality is
disproportionately

18:54.291 --> 18:56.750
women of color are being
affected by the policies

18:56.750 --> 19:00.458
that are being
legislated in this state.

19:00.458 --> 19:01.542
- That's true.

19:01.542 --> 19:03.417
- And somebody has to say that.

19:03.417 --> 19:05.041
- That is true.

19:05.041 --> 19:07.375
(contemplative music)

19:28.291 --> 19:31.250
- What a great day it was to
allow the theology of Heaven

19:31.250 --> 19:32.208
to become biography
in the streets

19:32.208 --> 19:34.834
here in the city of
Jackson, Mississippi.

19:34.834 --> 19:36.458
(applauding)

19:38.834 --> 19:41.917
We can bring abortion to an end.

19:41.917 --> 19:43.000
Now if we just look
at this place here

19:43.000 --> 19:46.583
in Jackson, Mississippi
you see cracks all over

19:46.583 --> 19:49.458
the outside of that edifice,
everything just appears

19:49.458 --> 19:53.208
like it's break down and fall
and crumble to the ground.

19:53.208 --> 19:56.375
Let's push it over the cliff.

19:56.375 --> 19:58.125
Could it be possible that right

19:58.125 --> 20:02.208
at that memorial, right there,

20:02.208 --> 20:05.291
we could present to God the
first abortion free state.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.125
It will send a
message to the church

20:07.125 --> 20:08.708
of Jesus Christ
throughout this land.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.208
And will become a
bright shining light

20:11.208 --> 20:14.917
that will radiate from Jackson
into all of the other states

20:14.917 --> 20:18.875
saying we can take care
of this issue ourselves.

20:18.875 --> 20:20.542
(applauding)

20:26.542 --> 20:30.750
♪ But grace has taught
my heart to fear

20:32.208 --> 20:37.083
♪ And grace our fears relieved

20:40.208 --> 20:43.375
♪ How precious did

- Hallelujah Lord, Jesus!

21:25.625 --> 21:29.166
(cheering and applauding)

21:32.250 --> 21:34.625
(contemplative music)

21:48.208 --> 21:51.041
- I'll tell you another thing
that's happening around here.

21:51.041 --> 21:55.291
I'm making a stump speech, I
have a stump speech you know.

21:57.917 --> 22:00.458
I have to tell them why
we have to have CPC's.

22:00.458 --> 22:02.708
You know I'm raising
money. (laughs)

22:02.708 --> 22:03.625
Why do we need this?

22:03.625 --> 22:06.959
So I have to tell them
why we need CPC's.

22:06.959 --> 22:08.542
The enemy's become
bolder and louder.

22:08.542 --> 22:12.458
He insists on trying to
remove the shame and guilt

22:12.458 --> 22:16.500
from abortion by
denying that it exists.

22:16.500 --> 22:18.959
These are our children,
our Mississippi babies

22:18.959 --> 22:21.500
being destroyed and
what will our legacy be?

22:21.500 --> 22:22.667
What'll we leave behind?

22:25.291 --> 22:27.708
We will value all life as a gift

22:27.708 --> 22:30.375
from a mighty and merciful God.

22:34.333 --> 22:37.500
We're so thrilled to
have y'all here today.

22:37.500 --> 22:39.750
We are so blessed
that y'all have come

22:39.750 --> 22:43.291
to hear the governor and we're
so blessed with our governor.

22:43.291 --> 22:45.625
(applauding)

22:52.083 --> 22:55.583
- People say you need to leave
that abortion thing alone.

22:55.583 --> 22:56.625
All the things that
I believe in they say

22:56.625 --> 22:59.542
just leave alone and be
one of those moderate

22:59.542 --> 23:02.667
middle of the road politicians
and never take a stand.

23:05.625 --> 23:07.166
Just not me, I can't do that.

23:07.166 --> 23:09.500
- That's right.
- Amen.

23:09.500 --> 23:11.000
- So we're gonna
ask the legislature

23:11.000 --> 23:13.250
again to help protect children.

23:13.250 --> 23:16.542
Doesn't that child in the womb,
doesn't she have any rights?

23:20.708 --> 23:21.959
Doesn't she have
a right to life?

23:21.959 --> 23:25.041
(applauding)

23:25.041 --> 23:28.875
To liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness?

23:28.875 --> 23:31.708
So go into the pulpits
and spread the word.

23:31.708 --> 23:34.875
I'm gonna do all I
can whenever I can,

23:34.875 --> 23:37.834
in every way I can to
protect life in this state.

23:37.834 --> 23:42.667
One day, I do believe, that
I will stand before you

23:42.667 --> 23:44.125
and say there are no abortions

23:44.125 --> 23:45.125
being performed in Mississippi.

23:45.125 --> 23:46.834
(applauding)

23:46.834 --> 23:50.458
Thank you and watch your
leaders, God bless you all.

23:50.458 --> 23:52.750
(applauding)

23:52.750 --> 23:54.750
- The Mississippi
legislature passed a law

23:54.750 --> 23:56.750
that requires doctors
at abortion clinics,

23:56.750 --> 23:58.667
that is the one abortion clinic,

23:58.667 --> 24:00.417
to have admitting privileges
at a local hospital.

24:00.417 --> 24:03.041
- New Republican
governor Phil Bryant

24:03.041 --> 24:04.625
signed what's known
as a trap law,

24:04.625 --> 24:08.166
specifically target,
specifically onerous regulations

24:08.166 --> 24:09.708
for the state's
loan abortion clinic

24:09.708 --> 24:11.417
that other kinds
of medical clinics

24:11.417 --> 24:13.000
in Mississippi do
not have to follow.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.750
Republicans have proposed
these anti-abortion trap laws

24:15.750 --> 24:18.750
this session in Alabama,
Arizona, Florida,

24:18.750 --> 24:20.625
Indiana, Minnesota,
North Carolina,

24:20.625 --> 24:22.959
Oklahoma, Tennessee,
West Virginia.

24:22.959 --> 24:24.291
Mississippi is different though.

24:24.291 --> 24:25.959
In Mississippi officials
have been flat out

24:25.959 --> 24:28.667
admitting what they
have been trying to do.

24:44.500 --> 24:48.000
- What we simply say is that we

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
want Mississippi to
be abortion free.

24:51.000 --> 24:55.041
(applauding)

24:55.041 --> 24:58.125
(contemplative music)

25:17.041 --> 25:19.166
- And there's a lot that's
happening here in Mississippi

25:19.166 --> 25:20.583
particularly around
abortion care.

25:20.583 --> 25:21.917
I think if people
knew the particulars

25:21.917 --> 25:25.708
that they would understand
how important it is

25:28.750 --> 25:31.542
for them to way in on the issue.

25:31.542 --> 25:32.458
I think it's very
important that the whole

25:32.458 --> 25:34.500
country and the
whole world knows

25:34.500 --> 25:36.708
what's going on
here in Mississippi.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.166
This is the letter
from a hospital,

25:45.166 --> 25:47.250
this one of the
rejection letters.

25:47.250 --> 25:49.875
It says this
hospital has received

25:49.875 --> 25:51.583
your medical staff application.

25:51.583 --> 25:53.375
After preliminary review
the hospital has determined

25:53.375 --> 25:54.542
that your application
should be denied

25:54.542 --> 25:57.875
for the following reasons,
the nature of your proposed

25:57.875 --> 25:58.834
medical practice is inconsistent

25:58.834 --> 26:00.875
with this hospital's
policies and practices

26:00.875 --> 26:05.000
as concerned abortion and in
particular elective abortion.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.875
Number two in light
of this hospital's

26:06.875 --> 26:08.708
rules and regulations concerning
therapeutic abortions,

26:08.708 --> 26:11.208
namely that privileges
for such procedures

26:11.208 --> 26:13.041
are not considered within
the core privileges

26:13.041 --> 26:15.291
for gynecology or obstetrics,

26:15.291 --> 26:16.750
your application
does not comport

26:16.750 --> 26:19.000
with a functional
practice at this hospital.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.333
And number three, the nature of

26:21.333 --> 26:22.750
your proposed medical practice

26:22.750 --> 26:25.291
would lead to both an
internal and external

26:25.291 --> 26:26.542
disruption of this
hospital's function

26:26.542 --> 26:29.750
and business within
the community.

26:29.750 --> 26:32.875
(contemplative music)

26:43.166 --> 26:44.333
- [Protestor] Please
don't kill me!

26:44.333 --> 26:47.458
Don't kill my fetus in me!

26:51.208 --> 26:53.041
- Yep.

26:53.041 --> 26:54.083
- [Dr. Parker] And
how many is that on?

26:54.083 --> 26:55.375
- The only one I
was waiting on was

26:55.375 --> 26:58.125
actually yours
Madison River Oaks.

27:00.250 --> 27:01.834
It wasn't, it was at the?

27:01.834 --> 27:05.834
- So how many hospitals turned
us down altogether exactly?

27:06.542 --> 27:09.750
- We applied at seven, seven.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.083
- For each of us?

27:13.083 --> 27:14.083
- Yeah.

27:14.083 --> 27:16.166
- And that's all so.

27:16.166 --> 27:18.625
- Basically there was a
new law that was enacted.

27:18.625 --> 27:20.792
Affectively this law has
been setup to shut us down.

27:20.792 --> 27:23.708
Which means that the
state could come in

27:23.708 --> 27:27.500
and see if we are in fact
still performing abortions.

27:27.500 --> 27:28.375
And then they could
say hey you're

27:28.375 --> 27:29.792
not in compliance
with state law.

27:29.792 --> 27:33.667
And they could enact
us getting closed down.

27:33.667 --> 27:34.583
We do have a legal
team and we are working

27:34.583 --> 27:36.875
and other states are looking

27:36.875 --> 27:38.792
and saying hey
Mississippi come on.

27:38.792 --> 27:40.458
You guys have the highest
rate of teen pregnancy.

27:40.458 --> 27:43.333
You have no sex
education anywhere.

27:45.291 --> 27:46.792
This is an issue
that predominantly

27:46.792 --> 27:49.333
affects poor black
women in this state.

27:49.333 --> 27:52.667
- Our state is falling
tremendously in education.

27:52.667 --> 27:55.041
You mean to tell
you you got this

27:55.041 --> 27:57.917
much attention on
a woman's rights.

27:59.834 --> 28:02.041
- I don't think you can withhold
sex education from people

28:02.041 --> 28:04.583
and then also withhold
the option for abortion.

28:04.583 --> 28:08.041
People need information
and access to care.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.083
So will see, we'll
see what happens.

28:10.083 --> 28:15.166
But the next days, weeks,
months are tentative.

28:15.166 --> 28:18.250
(contemplative music)

28:24.792 --> 28:26.583
- Y'all ready to eat?

28:35.625 --> 28:40.041
I bet Jamar is gonna eat some
butter beans and some greens.

28:40.041 --> 28:43.750
Jamar you gonna eat some butter
beans and some greens today?

28:43.750 --> 28:46.583
I need to make you
some candied yams.

28:46.583 --> 28:48.166
You want some candied yams?

28:48.166 --> 28:48.875
- [Jamar] Yes ma'am.

28:50.750 --> 28:53.834
- [Mother] I'll
bring it to you okay.

29:06.625 --> 29:09.208
- [April] I pray it's a boy.

29:09.208 --> 29:10.250
- Oh goodness.

29:12.166 --> 29:13.667
Is this little one yours?

29:13.667 --> 29:16.125
Alright how old is that one?

29:16.125 --> 29:17.625
- She'll be one Tuesday.

29:17.625 --> 29:20.583
- [Nurse] Oh my
gosh, are you crazy?

29:21.250 --> 29:24.500
How old are the other ones?

29:24.500 --> 29:25.834
- Let's just say one,
two, three, and four.

29:25.834 --> 29:30.667
- No, oh my gosh.
(baby crying)

29:30.667 --> 29:33.125
Alright, baby's head is down.

29:33.125 --> 29:35.250
It's laying on it's belly.

29:36.250 --> 29:37.041
Is this the last one?

29:42.125 --> 29:42.917
Oh my gosh.

29:49.083 --> 29:50.875
Second thoughts?

29:50.875 --> 29:51.667
About what?

29:51.667 --> 29:52.542
- My baby.

30:12.458 --> 30:13.375
Be honest.

30:15.000 --> 30:15.959
- Not more than three.

30:27.959 --> 30:28.834
Awe now.

30:39.917 --> 30:40.625
- Yep, it's a boy.

30:40.625 --> 30:43.291
- [Nurse] It is a boy.

30:45.708 --> 30:48.083
- See you.
- Have a good day.

30:54.792 --> 30:56.959
- [April] Hey why
you in my stuff now?

31:04.625 --> 31:05.750
- You know you called him.

31:05.750 --> 31:06.708
You knew he was out.

31:06.708 --> 31:10.417
I'm just telling you,
trying to help you.

31:10.417 --> 31:12.083
How you gonna tell
me he was out?

31:12.083 --> 31:13.834
I don't give a fuck
about him being out!

31:13.834 --> 31:14.458
- Okay Momma.

31:14.458 --> 31:16.625
- Jesus.
- Dang.

31:17.875 --> 31:19.375
- Man fill you up
with kids and he don't

31:19.375 --> 31:22.500
give a fuck about
a damn one of them.

31:39.250 --> 31:43.500
But to come with some more
dick in you when you ask.

31:47.041 --> 31:48.708
You know what my
children daddy tell me?

31:48.708 --> 31:50.208
Don't look for no man
to take care of you.

31:50.208 --> 31:53.500
Don't ever look for
no man to help you.

31:54.542 --> 31:55.834
You don't need to
be worried about me,

31:55.834 --> 31:58.667
worry about your kids, don't
worry about me, don't call me.

31:58.667 --> 32:00.959
(dog barking)

32:00.959 --> 32:02.208
Leave that dog alone boy.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.583
Put that pizza down.

32:05.583 --> 32:08.083
(dog barking)

32:14.917 --> 32:17.250
(contemplative music)

32:46.000 --> 32:48.792
- Yes ma'am, I was wondering
'cause she has been

32:48.792 --> 32:51.542
inviting me to come to these
Momma's and Me classes.

32:51.542 --> 32:52.708
Ain't it tomorrow?

32:52.708 --> 32:55.458
- [JT] Yes, it's
tomorrow and at 11:15.

32:55.458 --> 32:56.959
- Okay can you let her know that

32:56.959 --> 32:59.542
I was gonna come to the
Mommy and Me class tomorrow.

32:59.542 --> 33:01.959
- [JT] I will, what's your name?

33:01.959 --> 33:03.250
- April Jackson.

33:03.250 --> 33:05.917
- [JT] Okay April, I've got you
down for the class tomorrow.

33:05.917 --> 33:07.333
- Okay thank you.

33:10.375 --> 33:13.458
(contemplative music)

34:08.958 --> 34:11.417
- Are you feeling bad April?

34:11.417 --> 34:13.708
No, but they just
want you to be careful

34:13.708 --> 34:16.375
'cause of your blood
pressure and stuff.

34:16.375 --> 34:17.125
Listen you're gonna
have you a whole.

34:17.125 --> 34:19.417
One of them's gonna have to be

34:19.417 --> 34:22.208
a big old football player
and make Momma lots of money.

34:22.208 --> 34:24.417
(laughing)

34:25.291 --> 34:26.041
She wanted you to
sit over there.

34:26.041 --> 34:29.375
And you get to know Ms. Sonya.

34:32.375 --> 34:33.625
- Well before I kind of get into

34:33.625 --> 34:35.833
what I had planned for today,

34:35.833 --> 34:38.375
I want you to know
I'm a friend to you.

34:38.375 --> 34:42.625
And I care for you, so tell me
a little bit about yourself.

34:46.792 --> 34:48.041
- Well you know I'm
April Jackson anyway.

34:48.041 --> 34:51.333
I'm 24, I'm on my fifth child.

34:53.750 --> 34:55.917
My oldest child is four.

35:01.500 --> 35:05.750
- So kind of taking a bunch
of prerequisite courses.

35:08.667 --> 35:10.875
Okay, can you kind
of share with me

35:10.875 --> 35:13.542
why you think you
have five kids?

35:55.291 --> 35:57.458
So hold on, so help me.

35:57.458 --> 36:00.959
So that first child
that was conceived,

36:00.959 --> 36:03.792
you self aborted by
drinking Clorox and water?

36:03.792 --> 36:04.792
- No he, I.

36:06.208 --> 36:07.708
- When you said you bled through

36:07.708 --> 36:11.333
I guess I took that as
the baby was aborted.

36:20.667 --> 36:23.458
What, what's the take
on forgiveness, April?

36:29.166 --> 36:31.333
The only way you
can survive in life,

36:31.333 --> 36:34.625
the only way you
can go about life,

36:34.625 --> 36:37.500
is by leaning and
depending on Him.

36:43.083 --> 36:45.291
- I just stopped believing.

36:48.625 --> 36:51.291
- April what do you need today?

37:06.834 --> 37:10.959
Well let's go let you pick
out some stuff for her.

37:10.959 --> 37:12.750
You can come right in here.

37:12.750 --> 37:16.458
Here I'll let you
look through there.

37:16.458 --> 37:19.500
Here I'll let you kind of
pick through those as well.

37:19.500 --> 37:22.250
And see what you think will fit.

37:36.250 --> 37:37.417
- Ma'am can I offer
you some info?

37:37.417 --> 37:38.625
Can I pray with you?

37:38.625 --> 37:40.500
You know God loves you
and He created you,

37:40.500 --> 37:43.542
and He has a great
plan for you life.

37:45.917 --> 37:48.792
You know God is good.

37:48.792 --> 37:50.250
The scripture says
that Jesus came

37:50.250 --> 37:54.291
to give us life and
life more abundantly.

37:54.291 --> 37:55.250
You know there's a
Crisis Pregnancy Center

37:55.250 --> 37:57.500
and they offer free sonograms?

37:57.500 --> 38:01.250
They offer lots of free
help and counseling.

38:05.250 --> 38:08.959
- The state is here,
for our annual.

38:08.959 --> 38:09.750
You don't find out
they're coming.

38:09.750 --> 38:11.542
You find out when they get here.

38:15.667 --> 38:18.792
They're not allowed to tell
us when they're coming.

38:18.792 --> 38:21.917
So that's the point of it
to catch you off guard.

38:21.917 --> 38:24.375
That you're up on your stuff.

38:31.208 --> 38:31.542
Need that log.

38:33.125 --> 38:35.708
Timecards, timecards.

38:39.208 --> 38:40.500
Sure, you can ask me now.

38:43.333 --> 38:47.834
I'm saying you better
get it while you can.

38:49.208 --> 38:49.792
- [Inspector] It
was good to see you.

38:49.792 --> 38:52.000
- You too baby, you too.

38:56.291 --> 39:00.667
- So today what, were we
deemed to be in compliance?

39:00.667 --> 39:03.667
- [Shannon] We don't know until
they send us the paperwork.

39:03.667 --> 39:06.291
- [Dr. Parker] Good for
you, you run a tight ship.

39:06.291 --> 39:07.125
- Yeah, a very tight ship.

39:07.125 --> 39:09.959
- You play like you practice.

39:09.959 --> 39:11.208
That's what my coach
used to tell me.

39:11.208 --> 39:15.500
- Yay coach (cheering)
fear fingers.

39:15.500 --> 39:17.000
- [Shannon] Get out of here.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.125
- Fear fingers.

39:18.125 --> 39:21.291
- You know what you
get out of here too.

39:22.250 --> 39:23.333
It's different
every day isn't it?

39:23.333 --> 39:24.458
And it doesn't stop.

39:24.458 --> 39:27.000
Getting old, I'm getting
too old for this girl.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.792
Could of did this, probably
could have did it in my 20's.

39:28.792 --> 39:33.000
Dang I been here that long
since my 20's ain't it.

39:33.875 --> 39:36.500
(woman crying)

39:59.500 --> 40:02.125
We don't think Momma don't
know nothing 'til it's to late.

40:02.125 --> 40:03.500
And then we be like oh God.

40:03.500 --> 40:06.667
Then we scared to tell Momma,
and scared to say anything.

40:06.667 --> 40:09.542
Feel bad 'cause you feel
like you let Momma down.

40:09.542 --> 40:11.333
You know all that stuff.

40:11.333 --> 40:13.708
Your Momma love you, she gonna
love you regardless baby.

40:13.708 --> 40:18.542
'Cause if it happened to my
baby, I would love regardless.

40:18.542 --> 40:21.667
(contemplative music)

40:24.291 --> 40:25.959
You tell that boy gone on
Monday he's busy somewhere.

40:25.959 --> 40:28.375
Or whatever boy.

40:28.375 --> 40:30.208
Like I tell girls
and I tell mommas.

40:30.208 --> 40:33.500
I am not gonna say she not
gonna do nothing do more.

40:33.500 --> 40:34.917
You not able to say she
not gonna do nothing 'cause

40:34.917 --> 40:37.208
we don't never think they
gonna do it in the first place.

40:37.208 --> 40:38.834
Make sure you okay.

40:39.917 --> 40:41.542
If that's what you
decide to do one day,

40:41.542 --> 40:43.291
if that's what, you
know without Momma

40:43.291 --> 40:44.750
or anybody like
you did this time,

40:44.750 --> 40:46.959
you make sure you okay.

40:46.959 --> 40:49.417
You make sure you love yourself
more than anybody else okay.

40:49.417 --> 40:51.083
And if they can't
do that then you

40:51.083 --> 40:53.375
ain't got no business
with them no way.

40:53.375 --> 40:54.750
And that's the truth.

40:54.750 --> 40:57.333
- [Dr. Parker] What
time tomorrow does

40:57.333 --> 41:01.250
have to be in
service of the Queen.

41:01.250 --> 41:03.917
- Same time, same time,
you're dismissed too.

41:03.917 --> 41:06.000
- [Dr. Parker] Which is
what My Lady, what time?

41:06.000 --> 41:06.375
- 9:30.

41:06.375 --> 41:06.917
- 9:30?

41:06.917 --> 41:07.792
- Yes.

41:09.959 --> 41:14.125
(rain falling)
(contemplative music)

41:28.333 --> 41:31.875
Well the state came in today.

41:31.875 --> 41:32.959
And of course they let
me know that they came

41:32.959 --> 41:35.375
to check to see about
our admitting privileges.

41:35.375 --> 41:38.333
Of which of course
everybody knows

41:38.333 --> 41:40.583
that we don't have
and cannot acquire.

41:40.583 --> 41:41.792
Of course we're
not in compliance

41:41.792 --> 41:44.792
because none of
the hospitals will

41:44.792 --> 41:47.125
allow our doctors to
have admitting privileges

41:47.125 --> 41:52.125
because they for the most
part, the majority of them,

41:52.125 --> 41:55.750
don't want to be affiliated
with the abortion facility.

41:55.750 --> 41:57.458
Now I gotta figure
out what's next.

41:57.458 --> 42:00.417
Where do we go from here?

42:03.959 --> 42:06.000
I don't know, I hope not.

42:07.708 --> 42:10.291
I can honestly say I don't know.

42:10.291 --> 42:13.166
I think that is the
closest, this is the closest

42:13.166 --> 42:16.417
since I've been here
that the clinic is

42:17.000 --> 42:19.083
been close to closing.

42:20.458 --> 42:21.625
- [Director] Are you there?

42:21.625 --> 42:24.000
Alright now, next for him
and we'll be ready to go.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.625
- [Cameraman] Okay
we're good thank you.

42:25.625 --> 42:27.250
Cell phones to off.

42:30.834 --> 42:32.041
- Tonight we travel to the last

42:32.041 --> 42:34.500
abortion clinic in Mississippi,

42:34.500 --> 42:38.375
which as we arrive
has only 72 hours left

42:38.375 --> 42:42.625
before it appears the state
will shut it down forever.

42:43.542 --> 42:44.417
- [Shannon] Okay here
we go, here we go.

42:44.417 --> 42:45.750
- [Reporter] The last stand.

42:45.750 --> 42:50.375
Only 72 hours left and
the clock is ticking.

42:50.375 --> 42:52.542
It's Mississippi's
only abortion clinic.

42:52.542 --> 42:54.333
- There are babies being killed

42:54.333 --> 42:56.375
inside of this pink building.

42:56.375 --> 42:57.792
- [Reporter] The
clinic on life support.

42:57.792 --> 42:59.083
Which side wins?

43:01.708 --> 43:02.625
- [Announcer] This special
edition of Nightline,

43:02.625 --> 43:06.000
The Last Stand,
whose side is God on?

43:06.000 --> 43:06.959
We'll be back.

43:06.959 --> 43:08.875
- They said whose
side is God on.

43:10.583 --> 43:11.667
Now that's--

43:20.583 --> 43:23.417
- [Reporter] The clinic is
in violation of a state law.

43:23.417 --> 43:24.917
With that hearing
fast approaching

43:24.917 --> 43:29.166
the protestor believe they
are on the verge of triumph.

43:30.083 --> 43:32.083
Barbara Beavers plays
a different role

43:32.083 --> 43:34.375
in the anti-abortion
rights movement.

43:34.375 --> 43:37.583
Beavers runs a Crisis
Pregnancy Center.

43:37.583 --> 43:41.208
- [Barbara] We have
sanitized abortions.

43:41.208 --> 43:44.250
We can't go back to
the coat hanger days.

43:44.250 --> 43:47.417
So we don't call them
coat hangers anymore.

43:47.417 --> 43:49.375
We call them cannulas.

43:51.917 --> 43:53.125
That cannula does the same thing

43:53.125 --> 43:56.125
to the baby that
the coat hanger did.

43:56.125 --> 43:56.875
- Well but it doesn't
kill the mother--

43:56.875 --> 44:00.542
- But it still kills the baby.

44:00.542 --> 44:02.667
- [Reporter] And so
the battle continues,

44:02.667 --> 44:05.041
each side claims a
high wall of purpose

44:05.041 --> 44:08.458
in which there is no
room for compromise.

44:08.458 --> 44:11.458
But for now, this
clinic stays open.

44:18.000 --> 44:23.458
- They think life is just
what they do, that's life.

44:23.458 --> 44:25.959
And they think that's
life for everybody.

44:25.959 --> 44:27.875
They don't know
anything about the hood,

44:27.875 --> 44:31.166
the ghetto, drugs
and all that stuff.

44:31.166 --> 44:32.333
They don't know
anything about that.

44:32.333 --> 44:34.000
The whole thing is
stop trying to convince

44:34.000 --> 44:37.041
everybody else that what
they doing is the wrong thing

44:37.041 --> 44:42.041
because there is no right
except what you know.

44:42.041 --> 44:42.875
You don't want to be judged for

44:42.875 --> 44:44.959
the way that you
raise your kids.

44:44.959 --> 44:46.125
You don't want to be judged for

44:46.125 --> 44:47.834
the way that you live your life.

44:47.834 --> 44:49.750
Why are you judging
everybody for

44:49.750 --> 44:51.959
the way that they
are living theirs?

44:55.375 --> 44:59.250
They are the most judgemental
people I've ever met.

44:59.250 --> 45:00.542
I'm 41 years old, those people

45:00.542 --> 45:02.333
that stand out there
are more judgemental

45:02.333 --> 45:05.708
than anybody I have
ever met in my life.

45:07.875 --> 45:10.458
(somber music)

45:26.417 --> 45:29.000
(April crying)

46:09.500 --> 46:11.208
- Alright thank you.

46:41.166 --> 46:43.750
(somber music)

46:46.125 --> 46:48.917
(knocking on door)

46:56.792 --> 46:59.333
(somber music)

47:46.583 --> 47:50.166
(sirens blaring)

48:07.125 --> 48:10.708
- This is not customary to
do this but JT just heard

48:10.708 --> 48:13.500
mention she was probably
sleeping with the baby.

48:13.500 --> 48:14.583
We don't always get that word.

48:14.583 --> 48:18.125
We don't always realize
that's what's going on.

48:24.917 --> 48:27.458
Is that grandma there?

48:27.458 --> 48:30.208
No that's, that's
one of the boys.

48:32.083 --> 48:33.542
Bringing presents.

48:34.708 --> 48:39.208
Bringing presents for the baby,
got something for the baby.

48:39.208 --> 48:40.083
You gonna let me in?

48:40.083 --> 48:43.291
You want to come
see it, come on?

48:43.291 --> 48:44.166
Hello there.

48:46.667 --> 48:48.708
Hello there, we brought you one.

48:48.708 --> 48:50.333
- [April] Well come on in.

48:50.333 --> 48:52.917
- [Brother] You need
me to get that for you?

48:52.917 --> 48:55.250
- You are fine looking boys.

48:56.708 --> 48:59.166
Hey now Ty, we got you a bed.

49:00.250 --> 49:04.291
We want that bed put up
and we want in that bed.

49:06.125 --> 49:07.250
That'll be better for you.

49:07.250 --> 49:11.208
Give you a little space
from these other children.

49:11.208 --> 49:13.291
Well let's pray for your mama.

49:13.291 --> 49:14.917
Father God thank you
for what you're doing

49:14.917 --> 49:17.917
in our lives, it's
not easy Lord.

49:17.917 --> 49:21.125
But you can enable
us and empower us

49:21.125 --> 49:23.834
and I pray grace for April.

49:23.834 --> 49:26.458
Okay well I need to scoot back,

49:26.458 --> 49:28.792
Ms. Marlene's by herself
so I need to go back.

49:28.792 --> 49:31.375
But keep us in touch.

49:34.125 --> 49:35.458
We love you.
- We'll see y'all.

49:35.458 --> 49:37.166
- We'll see you later.

49:38.583 --> 49:40.458
I trust that that'll
be a blessing.

49:40.458 --> 49:44.708
You come on when you can,
come on when you can April.

50:09.500 --> 50:10.625
Oh my lands.

50:17.333 --> 50:22.333
I think of where I been
this weekend with my grands.

50:22.333 --> 50:23.583
It makes me sad.

50:27.542 --> 50:29.083
It makes me sad.

50:33.542 --> 50:38.166
I'm torn about that if you
want to know the truth.

50:38.166 --> 50:41.333
I don't know, I don't
know about that.

50:42.333 --> 50:45.375
I don't think birth
control is the answer.

50:45.375 --> 50:46.458
I think ultimately what's gonna

50:46.458 --> 50:49.041
work is gonna be self control.

50:49.041 --> 50:51.834
And I think that's
our job moreso than

50:51.834 --> 50:54.208
giving her birth control is to,

50:56.208 --> 51:00.500
to encourage her
to assess herself

51:00.500 --> 51:04.750
and her value and her worth in
such a way that she does not,

51:09.208 --> 51:11.708
she doesn't give herself away.

51:11.708 --> 51:14.959
The real issue with
abortion is our immorality,

51:14.959 --> 51:16.875
our sexual immorality.

51:18.208 --> 51:19.542
And who am I to say that?

51:19.542 --> 51:22.625
I'm not, but God
says it in His word.

51:22.625 --> 51:24.875
And I've seen it work positively

51:24.875 --> 51:27.000
in my own life and in
the lives of others.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.250
And I've seen it work negatively

51:29.250 --> 51:31.375
when done in the world's ways.

51:31.375 --> 51:35.333
God's ways work and that's
why don't give birth control

51:35.333 --> 51:38.166
or all that kind of stuff
'cause God's ways work.

51:38.166 --> 51:39.083
And they're 100%
affective and they're

51:39.083 --> 51:43.375
good for you body,
soul, and spirit.

51:43.375 --> 51:46.458
(contemplative music)

51:51.417 --> 51:52.625
- [April] Hey guys.

51:52.625 --> 51:54.834
- Could you sign in for me?

51:55.583 --> 51:58.583
- [Ms. Sonya] Hey bundle of joy.

52:05.250 --> 52:10.208
- [Counselor] I don't
think she had planned to.

52:33.583 --> 52:36.041
- I trust myself a whole lot.

52:40.959 --> 52:41.625
- Can we see the baby?

52:41.625 --> 52:43.291
Are you showing off baby?

52:43.291 --> 52:45.291
Monica's just dying
to see this baby.

52:45.291 --> 52:47.917
I am being very rude aren't I?

52:47.917 --> 52:50.333
But she's new and she
needs to. (laughing)

52:50.333 --> 52:54.500
This is what she's
here for. (laughing)

52:58.792 --> 53:02.083
(door shuts)

53:04.875 --> 53:05.959
- I want my daughter
to be 10 times

53:05.959 --> 53:09.333
a better mama, than I
a person than I was.

53:09.333 --> 53:10.834
I want her to be better.

53:10.834 --> 53:12.333
Don't go out and make
the mistakes I made.

53:12.333 --> 53:15.667
Say I want to be better
than what my momma was.

53:15.667 --> 53:18.542
Do what's right,
go to school baby.

53:24.166 --> 53:27.708
I could be going to hair school.

54:04.792 --> 54:07.834
- You just want to
not take a chance.

54:27.959 --> 54:30.458
(baby crying)

54:32.792 --> 54:36.000
- Here we go my darling,
here we go my darling.

54:36.000 --> 54:40.083
(contemplative music)

54:59.000 --> 55:01.625
- We've been traveling from
San Francisco and New York

55:01.625 --> 55:03.542
and really shining a
light on nationwide

55:03.542 --> 55:05.959
there's a state of emergency
for abortion rights.

55:05.959 --> 55:07.792
I guess one thing
I want to ask you

55:07.792 --> 55:09.375
that we would like to
learn more about too

55:09.375 --> 55:10.333
is maybe you could
tell us a little

55:10.333 --> 55:13.291
bit about the patients you see.

55:13.291 --> 55:15.917
- I don't even
know where to start

55:15.917 --> 55:18.959
as far as what type
of patients are there.

55:18.959 --> 55:20.125
Of course the majority
of our patients

55:20.125 --> 55:22.667
are African American patients.

55:23.625 --> 55:24.750
I saw a lot of
patients who would come

55:24.750 --> 55:27.041
for their first visit
and you know the come,

55:27.041 --> 55:29.667
I've seen them come for their
first visit and be six weeks.

55:29.667 --> 55:33.583
And come back at last day
that they can be here.

55:33.583 --> 55:34.792
Trying to come up
with the money,

55:34.792 --> 55:35.917
as you're trying to
come up with the money

55:35.917 --> 55:37.166
with the fetus debt
increases and then.

55:37.166 --> 55:39.875
So I've seen that a lot.

55:39.875 --> 55:41.667
- I'm glad there's the funds
but that Hyde Amendment,

55:41.667 --> 55:43.500
that's what's killing women
that you're on Medicaid,

55:43.500 --> 55:46.750
you can't use that to
cover your abortion.

55:46.750 --> 55:49.166
But it's outrageous that
there are these laws

55:49.166 --> 55:50.458
saying you can get any
kind of medical procedure

55:50.458 --> 55:52.625
covered, almost, but
not if you're pregnant

55:52.625 --> 55:55.375
and you don't want to
be, you can't get that.

55:55.375 --> 55:57.834
- Because I mean we
even have patients who

55:57.834 --> 56:01.208
get funding and
still don't have,

56:01.208 --> 56:02.500
can't come up with
the other part.

56:02.500 --> 56:03.458
- I know because the funds they,

56:03.458 --> 56:05.417
I know what they do
and it's a good thing.

56:05.417 --> 56:07.834
But they say do you have,
can you collect cans?

56:07.834 --> 56:08.667
Do you have any
jewelry you can sell?

56:08.667 --> 56:10.417
- [Shannon] Or can
you pawn, yeah.

56:10.417 --> 56:11.542
- [Activist] Can
you pawn something.

56:11.542 --> 56:12.500
Women go through a lot of--

56:12.500 --> 56:16.166
- It's like being
degraded almost.

56:16.166 --> 56:17.208
- [Activist] Yeah it
is very degrading.

56:17.208 --> 56:18.083
- Yeah.

56:19.583 --> 56:21.166
- [Reporter] The Jackson
Women's Health Organization

56:21.166 --> 56:24.750
is gearing up for a legal
fight to keep the doors open.

56:24.750 --> 56:27.458
In a socially and religiously
conservative state,

56:27.458 --> 56:30.041
some say political
pressure may be a reason

56:30.041 --> 56:34.041
hospitals haven't signed
on to help the clinic.

56:34.041 --> 56:36.000
- The question that the court
is really asking tomorrow

56:36.000 --> 56:38.542
is can the state
constitutionally do,

56:38.542 --> 56:42.458
indirectly and underhandedly,
what it very clearly

56:42.458 --> 56:45.917
may not do directly which
is to outright ban abortion.

56:45.917 --> 56:48.625
The real story here
is what's at stake

56:48.625 --> 56:50.250
is the lives, and the health,

56:50.250 --> 56:51.458
and the diginity of
women in Mississippi.

56:51.458 --> 56:53.500
(cheering and applauding)

56:53.500 --> 56:55.542
- [Activist] Is this
clinic gonna shut down?

56:55.542 --> 56:57.208
- [Crowd] No!

56:57.208 --> 56:58.208
- [Activist] Are you
gonna tell the women

56:58.208 --> 56:59.708
of Mississippi and
around the country

56:59.708 --> 57:01.250
that they can't have abortions?

57:01.250 --> 57:02.750
- [Crowd] Hell no!

57:02.750 --> 57:04.208
- Are we gonna tell
women they should

57:04.208 --> 57:05.375
be ashamed of their abortions?

57:05.375 --> 57:06.500
- [Crowd] Hell no!

57:06.500 --> 57:09.458
- [Activist] This
clinic stays open.

57:09.458 --> 57:11.917
- [Crowd] This
clinic stays open!

57:11.917 --> 57:14.083
- [Activist] No more
lives of women broken.

57:14.083 --> 57:17.083
- [Crowd] No more
lives of women broken!

57:17.083 --> 57:18.959
- I am just overwhelmed.

57:19.917 --> 57:23.458
(cheering and applauding)

57:24.250 --> 57:25.375
I really am.

57:27.083 --> 57:30.458
I have never experienced
this many people

57:30.458 --> 57:33.875
just coming out for
us, for all clinics.

57:36.417 --> 57:39.500
We have got to take shame
out of the word abortion.

57:39.500 --> 57:43.333
And until we stop being
ashamed of who are

57:43.333 --> 57:45.792
and what we believe in and
what we know to be right,

57:45.792 --> 57:49.625
we're gonna continue
to have these issues.

57:49.625 --> 57:52.750
It took me a long
time but when I found

57:52.750 --> 57:54.333
what my reason and
my purpose was,

57:54.333 --> 57:57.750
it's like a liberating feeling.

57:59.458 --> 58:00.166
Just knowing that this is what

58:00.166 --> 58:01.417
I'm supposed to be here to do.

58:01.417 --> 58:03.625
(cheering and applauding)

58:03.625 --> 58:04.542
- The world is watching.

58:04.542 --> 58:06.291
The world is watching
in Mississippi.

58:06.291 --> 58:08.333
This clinic stays open.

58:12.208 --> 58:15.542
(contemplative music)

59:27.333 --> 59:30.500
- Mississippi's only abortion
clinic can stay open tonight.

59:30.500 --> 59:31.583
- [Shannon] Come on, come
on, come on, come on.

59:31.583 --> 59:33.875
I want a picture with
the great Julie now.

59:33.875 --> 59:35.959
Yeah come on, come
on, come on Dianne.

59:35.959 --> 59:38.250
- [Reporter] The Fifth Circuit
of Appeals ruled a state law

59:38.250 --> 59:40.917
forcing doctors to get
admitting privileges

59:40.917 --> 59:44.625
at a local hospital
unconstitutional.

59:44.625 --> 59:47.417
- I am so impressed with
you girl, I really am.

59:47.417 --> 59:48.542
Y'all ready?

59:51.083 --> 59:53.250
- Pink house.
- Pink house.

59:53.250 --> 59:57.750
- We're not going anywhere,
this clinic stays open!

59:57.750 --> 01:00:02.583
- [Jennifer] Live in Jackson,
Jennifer Ortega, 16 WABT News.

01:00:02.583 --> 01:00:03.959
- I am so outdone.

01:00:03.959 --> 01:00:05.792
Dianne was crying girl.

01:00:07.375 --> 01:00:09.500
Oh my God and Nancy was crying.

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:10.375
Oh my God.

01:00:11.542 --> 01:00:15.083
Girl I was grinning all the
way here, I swear to God.

01:00:15.083 --> 01:00:16.667
Oh my God my nerves so bad.

01:00:16.667 --> 01:00:17.792
I was smiling all the way here.

01:00:17.792 --> 01:00:19.083
I swear to God I couldn't stop.

01:00:19.083 --> 01:00:22.166
I was driving by myself like I
was with somebody in the car.

01:00:22.166 --> 01:00:23.542
- I saw several
women who were crying

01:00:23.542 --> 01:00:25.417
oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

01:00:25.417 --> 01:00:27.667
- [Shannon] Ms.
Betty was screaming.

01:00:27.667 --> 01:00:28.667
- [Dr. Parker] We
found out about this

01:00:28.667 --> 01:00:30.458
just as we were walking
out of the clinic.

01:00:30.458 --> 01:00:32.458
So now they have to
try and appeal it,

01:00:32.458 --> 01:00:35.959
which they are gonna do.

01:00:35.959 --> 01:00:38.959
- That's Instagram, I
know you don't know.

01:00:38.959 --> 01:00:41.291
He said Jackson Women's
Health stays open, thank God.

01:00:41.291 --> 01:00:43.959
I said yeah that's just what
the protestors love to hear.

01:00:43.959 --> 01:00:45.792
Thank God what do
they mean by that?

01:00:45.792 --> 01:00:46.959
Thank God, they believe in God?

01:00:46.959 --> 01:00:47.834
- [Dr. Parker] You
might want to make sure

01:00:47.834 --> 01:00:49.333
somebody takes a
good look around

01:00:49.333 --> 01:00:51.625
tomorrow before
anybody goes in there.

01:00:51.625 --> 01:00:54.250
Do we have like surveillance
cameras at night?

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:56.458
- Yeah Irene I'm telling you.

01:00:56.458 --> 01:00:58.125
That's what I told her,
we need to call the FBI

01:00:58.125 --> 01:00:59.750
and we need to
call the commander.

01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:02.583
Because if something's
gonna happen

01:01:02.583 --> 01:01:04.208
this is when something's
gonna happen.

01:01:04.208 --> 01:01:08.125
- When they don't prevail
through legitimate means,

01:01:08.125 --> 01:01:12.250
then kind of vigilante
activity picks up.

01:01:12.250 --> 01:01:15.041
- You gonna be at the
clinic in the morning?

01:01:15.917 --> 01:01:19.000
Dianne is gonna want
you to come up there.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.625
That's what we discussing now,

01:01:20.625 --> 01:01:23.750
to do a good walk around,
walk through and stuff.

01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:26.834
(contemplative music)

01:01:37.166 --> 01:01:39.083
- So here we are.

01:01:39.083 --> 01:01:40.667
I'm gonna ask you
tonight to mourn.

01:01:40.667 --> 01:01:42.834
As we pray, let's mourn.

01:01:42.834 --> 01:01:44.125
We aught to cry.

01:01:45.542 --> 01:01:48.500
Because unless we're
doing something about it,

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.667
- Come on now, come on.

01:01:50.667 --> 01:01:52.000
- [Preacher] I
can't say that we're

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.625
pro-life until we
take action on it.

01:01:53.625 --> 01:01:56.083
- Amen.
- Amen, yes.

01:01:56.083 --> 01:01:58.333
- We've been to
the Supreme Court.

01:01:58.333 --> 01:02:00.041
We've been to the
halls of Congress.

01:02:00.041 --> 01:02:02.750
Father God we as a nation
have forgotten you.

01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:07.375
We sing songs about you God
while the blood of our children

01:02:07.375 --> 01:02:10.792
is running under the
sewers of our church.

01:02:10.792 --> 01:02:13.750
Lord the Devil is
having a hay day.

01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:15.875
It's not because our
government has failed.

01:02:15.875 --> 01:02:17.542
It is because we have failed.

01:02:17.542 --> 01:02:19.708
God forgive us.

01:02:20.625 --> 01:02:23.875
♪ Heir of salvation
purchase of God

01:02:26.875 --> 01:02:31.083
♪ Born of His spirit
washed in His blood

01:02:35.041 --> 01:02:39.041
- Dorenda, get her to come a
little bit more over this way.

01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:42.667
Come on sweetheart let's go
ahead and get you inside okay.

01:02:42.667 --> 01:02:44.667
- [Protestor] Some
information with you please.

01:02:44.667 --> 01:02:47.083
- Can I give you this card?

01:02:47.083 --> 01:02:49.750
So you can go to a free clinic.

01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:51.708
- [Shannon] Whenever y'all
ready we'll get you inside.

01:02:51.708 --> 01:02:53.083
- [Protestor] Wonder if I could
share this with you please.

01:02:53.083 --> 01:02:56.667
- [Shannon] Come on honey we'll
get you right over here okay

01:02:56.667 --> 01:02:58.667
- We'd ask you in Jesus name to

01:02:58.667 --> 01:03:01.125
please have mercy on the unborn.

01:03:01.125 --> 01:03:04.583
Wonder if I could share
this with you please.

01:03:04.583 --> 01:03:05.333
Won't you let that little baby

01:03:05.333 --> 01:03:08.166
girl or boy be borned alive mom?

01:03:09.166 --> 01:03:12.625
Ma'am we'd you to please
let us help if we can.

01:03:12.625 --> 01:03:13.959
We got a Crisis
Pregnancy Center,

01:03:13.959 --> 01:03:16.542
get you any kind of help
that you might need.

01:03:16.542 --> 01:03:18.708
- [Keith] Ladies
please, my name's Keith.

01:03:18.708 --> 01:03:20.583
I want to give you
some information.

01:03:20.583 --> 01:03:21.667
- [Woman] We don't want it.

01:03:21.667 --> 01:03:24.959
- [Keith] Ma'am are you
going to have an abortion?

01:03:24.959 --> 01:03:25.917
- All--

01:03:25.917 --> 01:03:29.500
- lives matter, you
damn right they do.

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:32.083
We are more than capable
of making decisions

01:03:32.083 --> 01:03:36.667
for our bodies and our
lives and our future.

01:04:30.291 --> 01:04:32.708
- One of my children I was
gonna give up for adoption.

01:04:32.708 --> 01:04:33.834
Because I went to
abortion clinic.

01:04:33.834 --> 01:04:36.708
I remember I came
home and I just cried,

01:04:36.708 --> 01:04:38.166
cried, cried, 'cause
I was too far.

01:04:38.166 --> 01:04:42.959
I was barely making it,
I was barely making it.

01:04:42.959 --> 01:04:44.291
I had just moved
to my apartment.

01:04:44.291 --> 01:04:45.500
I didn't have any furniture.

01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:49.625
I had a matrass that I had
gotten from Salvation Army.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.875
And that's what I
had in my house.

01:04:53.875 --> 01:04:58.166
I had children at this time
and we slept on the mattress.

01:04:58.166 --> 01:04:59.750
So when they brought
the baby to the room

01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:03.291
and I picked the baby up
and I was hugging the baby.

01:05:03.291 --> 01:05:06.625
And I just, I
decided I could not

01:05:06.625 --> 01:05:08.708
do it right there at that point.

01:05:08.708 --> 01:05:11.041
I couldn't have a
child come back to me

01:05:11.041 --> 01:05:14.875
when they turn however
old and say why, why.

01:05:17.208 --> 01:05:18.542
If you have an
abortion you don't

01:05:18.542 --> 01:05:21.417
even know who this
would have been.

01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:24.000
So that's totally
two different things

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.542
and that's what
people don't get.

01:05:27.542 --> 01:05:29.875
It's harder to see your child,

01:05:29.875 --> 01:05:33.792
and then just hand your
child away to somebody.

01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:38.750
I believe in abortion because,

01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:42.875
no woman should have to
feel the way that I feel.

01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:49.750
No woman should have to do
that, they just shouldn't.

01:06:42.917 --> 01:06:44.792
- He's such a fucking asshole.

01:06:44.792 --> 01:06:47.250
Excuse my language.

01:07:40.333 --> 01:07:43.417
(contemplative music)

01:08:54.125 --> 01:08:56.542
- [Reporter] Mississippi's only
abortion clinic vandalized.

01:08:56.542 --> 01:08:59.917
Security cameras ripped down,
power cords tampered with,

01:08:59.917 --> 01:09:01.875
and their generator vandalized.

01:09:01.875 --> 01:09:03.792
Surveillance video may just have

01:09:03.792 --> 01:09:06.500
captured the prime
suspect on camera.

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:09.750
- Let me be clear, make
no mistake about it,

01:09:09.750 --> 01:09:11.792
this is a form of
domestic terrorism.

01:09:11.792 --> 01:09:13.792
- We're doing around
the clock security.

01:09:13.792 --> 01:09:16.041
We have someone
watching at all times,

01:09:16.041 --> 01:09:19.875
either on the facility of
somewhere close around.

01:09:19.875 --> 01:09:23.959
(contemplative music)

01:09:26.959 --> 01:09:29.291
- Number one cause
of death in America.

01:09:29.291 --> 01:09:32.332
God hates the hands that
shed innocent blood sir,

01:09:32.332 --> 01:09:35.375
and you're actually helping
them do that right now.

01:09:35.375 --> 01:09:37.166
You're the part of the
system that kills children.

01:09:37.166 --> 01:09:39.667
Half the black women
who get pregnant

01:09:39.667 --> 01:09:41.500
will have an abortion sir.

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:45.166
- [Keith] You don't have
to come in here guys.

01:09:45.166 --> 01:09:49.041
I'm not a protestor
I'm a peacemaker.

01:09:49.041 --> 01:09:50.792
- And make no mistake about it.

01:09:50.792 --> 01:09:53.959
What you are doing
here is wanton,

01:09:53.959 --> 01:09:56.291
wilful, premeditated murder.

01:10:01.417 --> 01:10:06.333
- It's the OSA, OSA which
is Operation Save America,

01:10:06.333 --> 01:10:11.000
and AHA which is
Abolish Human Abortion,

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.083
which that's one of
the newer groups.

01:10:14.792 --> 01:10:16.333
There are quite a few of them

01:10:16.333 --> 01:10:18.959
from the dossier that are here.

01:10:23.583 --> 01:10:25.583
T Russell, you have Toby.

01:10:28.834 --> 01:10:30.875
Alright you too, bye bye.

01:10:32.583 --> 01:10:35.000
She don't know shit.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.875
Swear to God I hate
talking to the same people.

01:10:37.875 --> 01:10:40.041
I'm like, she's asking
me who's gonna be here,

01:10:40.041 --> 01:10:42.792
and I'm like is the fucking FBI?

01:10:47.083 --> 01:10:49.375
That's why I know these people
are not gonna protect you.

01:10:49.375 --> 01:10:50.375
These people are gonna come out

01:10:50.375 --> 01:10:53.166
the wood works after
somebody gets killed.

01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:54.125
Then they'll come
out the wood works

01:10:54.125 --> 01:10:55.750
and everybody wants
to be the hero and say

01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:57.542
oh I have all your
screening there was

01:10:57.542 --> 01:11:00.458
a this on premise, man
please somebody's dead now.

01:11:00.458 --> 01:11:02.959
I don't care nothing
about what you got now.

01:11:02.959 --> 01:11:07.291
(Shannon sighs heavily)

01:11:08.083 --> 01:11:12.208
(contemplative music)

01:11:23.041 --> 01:11:25.458
The truth is out because I
know it's something going on.

01:11:25.458 --> 01:11:29.750
Keith Dawson leads the Jackson,
Mississippi chapter of AHA.

01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:33.083
He has targeted Willie
Parker as part of the AHA

01:11:33.083 --> 01:11:35.708
Call Out the Killers campaign.

01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:38.250
They have a Call Out
the Killers campaign?

01:11:38.250 --> 01:11:39.750
Now tell me that
doesn't look scary.

01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:43.291
- Okay but who was passing
through here early this morning?

01:11:43.291 --> 01:11:44.583
On a day we supposed
to be closed, Keith.

01:11:44.583 --> 01:11:45.291
- He was on his way to work.

01:11:45.291 --> 01:11:47.417
- [Shannon] Right, see how you

01:11:47.417 --> 01:11:48.583
keep justifying
Keith out of that.

01:11:48.583 --> 01:11:51.458
- I'm not justifying Keith,
I'm funning with you.

01:11:51.458 --> 01:11:53.166
The only thing that
I was serious about

01:11:53.166 --> 01:11:54.834
was when she said do
you think it was Keith?

01:11:54.834 --> 01:11:57.291
And I don't think
Keith did that.

01:11:57.291 --> 01:11:58.333
And I don't think
Keith would do that.

01:11:58.333 --> 01:12:00.291
All the other stuff I
was bullshitting about.

01:12:00.291 --> 01:12:01.959
- But my thing is I
don't feel that way

01:12:01.959 --> 01:12:04.959
about anybody from Ms.
Esther on, on the other side.

01:12:04.959 --> 01:12:06.583
Because the fact,
but the fact that

01:12:06.583 --> 01:12:08.625
you're on this side,
that bothers me.

01:12:08.625 --> 01:12:11.208
You don't know nothing about
that man when he leaves here.

01:12:11.208 --> 01:12:13.583
You know what he tells you,
what you read on Facebook.

01:12:13.583 --> 01:12:14.750
You don't know what's in that,

01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:16.583
that man could be building
a bomb in house right now,

01:12:16.583 --> 01:12:18.917
and come up here smiling
in your face every day.

01:12:18.917 --> 01:12:20.250
We don't know that.

01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:22.208
- And now I see where
the root is of all this.

01:12:22.208 --> 01:12:23.625
And I was not trying
to offend you,

01:12:23.625 --> 01:12:25.625
upset you, or take
or make it seem

01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:29.291
less serious than what it is.

01:12:29.291 --> 01:12:30.792
- If anybody let's
their guard down,

01:12:30.792 --> 01:12:33.250
something happens here,
something happens to this staff,

01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:35.542
I feel responsible for all
this shit, you don't get that.

01:12:35.542 --> 01:12:38.166
And for you to say
that and I'm thinking

01:12:38.166 --> 01:12:40.083
she got them out there.

01:12:40.083 --> 01:12:41.166
You not gonna be
able to tell me that.

01:12:41.166 --> 01:12:43.208
You see what I'm saying?

01:12:43.208 --> 01:12:45.041
You not gonna tell me
he wouldn't do that.

01:12:45.041 --> 01:12:47.500
I'm sorry, because I
don't believe that.

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:49.125
I don't believe that he
won't do that, I just.

01:12:49.125 --> 01:12:52.959
- [Guard] I apologize, I do.

01:12:52.959 --> 01:12:56.041
(contemplative music)

01:13:06.333 --> 01:13:08.667
- Alright here we are.

01:13:08.667 --> 01:13:11.750
(contemplative music)

01:13:20.625 --> 01:13:22.959
Not like, if you've
been there for a while

01:13:22.959 --> 01:13:24.417
you already cautious
but you become,

01:13:24.417 --> 01:13:27.208
you know you become
a little relaxed.

01:13:27.208 --> 01:13:28.542
This kind of wakes
me back up you know?

01:13:28.542 --> 01:13:31.917
Get it together now
Shannon, get it together.

01:13:31.917 --> 01:13:34.208
You know it's some loonies
out here, get it together.

01:13:34.208 --> 01:13:35.583
(laughing)

01:13:37.417 --> 01:13:38.291
Right here.
- Oh alright.

01:13:38.291 --> 01:13:39.750
My husband was
coaching that team.

01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:41.041
- Mr. Waters?
- Yeah.

01:13:41.041 --> 01:13:43.542
- Ow wow okay, my son's Jarvis.

01:13:46.250 --> 01:13:47.333
- Oh no no no.

01:13:47.333 --> 01:13:50.417
I'm the director at the
abortion facility here.

01:13:50.417 --> 01:13:51.000
- [Mrs. Waters] So like are
you interested in staying here?

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.625
- Sure.

01:13:53.875 --> 01:13:55.041
Wow, oh my God.

01:13:57.667 --> 01:13:59.083
Wow, ain't that something?

01:13:59.083 --> 01:14:00.333
Where are you?

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:02.583
Are you serious?

01:14:02.583 --> 01:14:03.917
Wow.

01:14:03.917 --> 01:14:06.125
The one thing I don't
think dealing with

01:14:06.125 --> 01:14:10.125
like the pro-life places,
and I don't know you as far

01:14:10.125 --> 01:14:11.917
as I don't know a lot about
the place where you are.

01:14:11.917 --> 01:14:13.333
But a lot of these places don't

01:14:13.333 --> 01:14:16.250
give women the
resources they need.

01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:17.583
It's something that's missing
that they're not getting

01:14:17.583 --> 01:14:20.083
to put them there because
me as a woman I know.

01:14:20.083 --> 01:14:21.750
I have six kids of my own.

01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:25.208
I know that you can
get in these situations

01:14:25.208 --> 01:14:26.792
and you don't know
what you're gonna do.

01:14:26.792 --> 01:14:30.458
- What we do is we say
you have three options.

01:14:30.458 --> 01:14:32.458
These are your three options.

01:14:32.458 --> 01:14:33.959
What do you know about
each of these options?

01:14:33.959 --> 01:14:35.000
- Got you.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.417
- And then if someone would say

01:14:36.417 --> 01:14:38.000
well I'm thinking about
having an abortion.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.125
So then I say tell me everything
you know about abortion.

01:14:41.125 --> 01:14:43.625
To see how much
they know about it.

01:14:43.625 --> 01:14:44.500
- [Shannon] Oh J Boo up.

01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:45.333
- [Mrs. Waters]
Oh is this yours?

01:14:45.333 --> 01:14:47.333
- [Shannon] This is me yeah.

01:14:47.333 --> 01:14:49.792
This is the thing when
I got pregnant with him,

01:14:49.792 --> 01:14:52.000
his dad and I were friends.

01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:59.500
I went to have an
abortion, I was too far.

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:02.500
I signed papers to have
an adoption to get,

01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:03.917
for my baby to be
adopted and everything.

01:15:03.917 --> 01:15:05.708
And when they brought
him to me to see him

01:15:05.708 --> 01:15:08.500
I called the adoption people
and told them I couldn't do it.

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:10.166
But that's, and that's that one.

01:15:10.166 --> 01:15:13.792
That's right, yeah
that's my fifth one.

01:15:13.792 --> 01:15:15.667
Yep I got one under him.

01:15:17.125 --> 01:15:18.875
And that's just basically what I

01:15:18.875 --> 01:15:23.291
live everyday for is just
to make sure they're good.

01:15:23.291 --> 01:15:25.250
'Cause my thing is if you,

01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:27.750
I am pro-choice because I
don't feel the need to judge

01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:29.708
the next person and tell
the next person what to do.

01:15:29.708 --> 01:15:32.333
Because a lot of the
adults that we have,

01:15:32.333 --> 01:15:35.417
including me, grew up lacking,

01:15:35.417 --> 01:15:38.708
not materialistic
stuff, stuff from here.

01:15:38.708 --> 01:15:42.500
And then you become, you're
lacking that as an adult.

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:45.500
And that changes
your whole world.

01:15:54.542 --> 01:15:55.792
Oh it's wild, it is wild.

01:16:01.375 --> 01:16:02.500
That's okay.

01:16:04.708 --> 01:16:06.792
Yeah she's a pro-lifer.

01:16:06.792 --> 01:16:10.875
It wasn't bad, we sat there
and talked for a long time.

01:16:10.875 --> 01:16:12.625
She's pro-life yeah.

01:16:19.208 --> 01:16:21.834
So it's a good thing.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.708
Oh you always got to be so
negative about everything baby.

01:16:30.708 --> 01:16:33.792
(contemplative music)

01:17:24.708 --> 01:17:27.583
(phone ringing)

01:17:27.583 --> 01:17:29.125
- How you doing today?

01:17:29.125 --> 01:17:31.625
- [Barbara] I'm doing
good, how are you doing?

01:17:31.625 --> 01:17:33.375
- I'm tired as ever.

01:17:35.917 --> 01:17:37.792
Yeah I still do both of them.

01:17:37.792 --> 01:17:40.959
- [Barbara] Oh my
goodness that's just.

01:17:40.959 --> 01:17:43.000
- Today is, shut up girl.

01:17:45.458 --> 01:17:47.959
(baby crying)

01:17:49.333 --> 01:17:51.625
My check didn't come
Saturday so I'm hoping

01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:53.917
it come today so I
can do something.

01:17:56.625 --> 01:17:59.166
Yeah they here, they here now.

01:18:04.792 --> 01:18:05.750
Okay, okay.

01:18:06.667 --> 01:18:08.000
- [Barbara] Okay,
talk to you later.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:08.917
- Okay.

01:18:08.917 --> 01:18:11.333
- [Barbara] Bye, bye bye.

01:18:11.333 --> 01:18:11.834
- [Brother] That
was Ms. Barbara?

01:18:11.834 --> 01:18:13.000
- [April] Yes.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.083
- [Brother] Is she coming?

01:18:17.583 --> 01:18:19.333
- [April] Hi Ricky
this is April.

01:18:19.333 --> 01:18:20.208
I was calling because I haven't

01:18:20.208 --> 01:18:23.083
received a check
today or Saturday.

01:18:23.083 --> 01:18:27.333
And I just was checking
on seeing why it didn't come.

01:18:27.875 --> 01:18:31.458
(contemplative music)

01:18:41.083 --> 01:18:43.000
(car approaching)

01:18:52.417 --> 01:18:55.041
- Love your dress,
look this is Aunt Bevy.

01:18:57.208 --> 01:19:00.250
I brought Aunt Bevy, this
is everybody's Aunt Bevy.

01:19:00.250 --> 01:19:01.583
This is April.

01:19:02.250 --> 01:19:04.583
We got enchiladas for you.

01:19:07.208 --> 01:19:08.083
- Not yet.

01:19:12.375 --> 01:19:14.208
- I'm sorry.

01:19:15.583 --> 01:19:18.083
Come on Malikye, we
want to see you walk.

01:19:20.083 --> 01:19:25.875
Get up boy.

01:19:25.875 --> 01:19:28.959
(contemplative music)

01:19:53.083 --> 01:19:56.917
- [Shannon] Thanks
for the enchiladas.

01:19:56.917 --> 01:20:00.041
(contemplative music)

01:20:17.917 --> 01:20:18.792
- Yep.

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:22.333
Yep, make me some mula.

01:20:25.375 --> 01:20:26.208
Some more what?

01:20:26.208 --> 01:20:27.458
- Candy.

01:20:27.458 --> 01:20:30.542
- Why we always got to
buy candy with the money?

01:20:30.542 --> 01:20:31.625
Let's buy some fish this time.

01:20:31.625 --> 01:20:34.083
Wanna buy some fish?

01:20:46.667 --> 01:20:47.500
- [April] Who?

01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:48.333
- You.

01:21:03.667 --> 01:21:05.166
- [April] Yep, little dude.

01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:10.667
- You take your thing with you?

01:21:10.667 --> 01:21:13.917
- [April] I love you too.

01:21:13.917 --> 01:21:17.000
(contemplative music)

01:21:23.792 --> 01:21:24.667
- She wanted to come
over last night.

01:21:24.667 --> 01:21:28.375
Y'all I go to sleep at night.

01:21:28.375 --> 01:21:31.125
She's up all night
probably kinda.

01:21:32.375 --> 01:21:34.625
Because of the night shift yeah.

01:21:34.625 --> 01:21:36.542
I think I'm afraid
she's gonna burn her,

01:21:36.542 --> 01:21:39.750
I'm afraid she's
bitten off more than,

01:21:40.708 --> 01:21:43.041
and that's youth, I
think that's youth.

01:21:43.041 --> 01:21:45.875
You've got to learn
to pace a little bit.

01:21:45.875 --> 01:21:47.041
You've got to learn to balance.

01:21:47.041 --> 01:21:50.000
And my goodness, how
much does she have to do?

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.083
You know it's just,
so I'm gonna cry.

01:21:55.875 --> 01:22:00.542
But sometimes you just need
something to keep you going.

01:22:00.542 --> 01:22:04.041
And April's my call
to keep going now.

01:22:04.041 --> 01:22:07.250
I've had the Lord just
intermittently, I'm weeping.

01:22:12.083 --> 01:22:15.208
Just waiting for
it to get easier.

01:22:15.208 --> 01:22:16.125
It doesn't get easier.

01:22:20.708 --> 01:22:22.083
We're on the winning side.

01:22:24.291 --> 01:22:26.542
And there's a glorious day.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:28.917
- [Interviewer] Do
you think there's

01:22:28.917 --> 01:22:31.208
a chance she could
get pregnant again?

01:22:33.041 --> 01:22:36.959
- I'm sure there is,
I'm sure there is.

01:22:36.959 --> 01:22:40.834
I see the solution
as self control,

01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:44.250
as learning how to
control ourselves.

01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:47.417
And plus condoms, they don't
prevent even used correctly.

01:22:47.417 --> 01:22:52.625
There's like a 20% failure
rate, even used correctly.

01:22:52.625 --> 01:22:57.417
There's a relatively high
failure rate of condoms.

01:22:57.417 --> 01:22:58.834
- [Interviewer] I
thought if a condom's

01:22:58.834 --> 01:23:00.250
used correctly
it's 98% affective.

01:23:00.250 --> 01:23:01.417
- Oh I don't believe that.

01:23:01.417 --> 01:23:04.959
I don't think that's, I
don't think that's correct.

01:23:04.959 --> 01:23:06.125
I would question that.

01:23:06.125 --> 01:23:10.250
I'll find some of
our data. (laughing)

01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:14.708
Send you some of that,
you can look at that.

01:23:14.708 --> 01:23:18.041
(contemplative music)

01:23:44.875 --> 01:23:47.333
- 17 weeks and two days.

01:23:47.333 --> 01:23:52.333
- [Mother] She's too far,
she can't do it can she?

01:23:54.458 --> 01:23:57.542
(contemplative music)

01:24:19.708 --> 01:24:22.375
- She was too far
for us to see her

01:24:22.375 --> 01:24:24.959
because we only go to 16 weeks.

01:24:25.834 --> 01:24:29.500
That's what they put
these laws in place for.

01:24:32.041 --> 01:24:35.041
They don't put the laws
in place to protect women.

01:24:35.041 --> 01:24:37.291
And she may not have
money to go out of town.

01:24:37.291 --> 01:24:39.000
And I guess you could say
the antis feel like they won.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
That's the point of it right?

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.083
So they feel like they
saved another one today.

01:24:44.083 --> 01:24:46.834
But at the same time
what did you save?

01:24:46.834 --> 01:24:47.708
You know what I'm saying?

01:24:47.708 --> 01:24:50.125
What did you do?

01:24:50.125 --> 01:24:53.208
You have made a
person's life harder.

01:24:54.625 --> 01:24:55.750
You judged her and
you made it harder.

01:24:55.750 --> 01:25:01.166
Judged all women as a whole,
and you made it harder.

01:25:01.166 --> 01:25:04.250
(contemplative music)

01:25:18.542 --> 01:25:20.083
- The Supreme Court
taking up it's biggest

01:25:20.083 --> 01:25:22.917
abortion case in
nearly 25 years.

01:25:22.917 --> 01:25:24.375
- Is agreeing to
review a Texas law

01:25:24.375 --> 01:25:25.917
that could force more
than three quarters

01:25:25.917 --> 01:25:29.792
of the states abortion to close.

01:25:29.792 --> 01:25:31.458
- [Reporter] The Texas trap
law does the same thing

01:25:31.458 --> 01:25:33.458
that Mississippi famously
tried to do last year,

01:25:33.458 --> 01:25:37.417
endangering that state's
only remaining clinic.

01:25:37.417 --> 01:25:40.500
(contemplative music)

01:25:42.166 --> 01:25:43.000
- [Activist] The
fact of the matter

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.750
is that lives are at stake.

01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:48.917
Individual lives are at stake.

01:25:48.917 --> 01:25:51.041
Your lives are at stake.

01:25:53.291 --> 01:25:56.000
- If they close all the
abortion clinics then

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.917
they think women are gonna
stop having abortions.

01:25:57.917 --> 01:26:00.708
They were having abortions
before they made it legal.

01:26:00.708 --> 01:26:03.083
What makes them think
they can stop it now?

01:26:03.083 --> 01:26:06.625
(cheering and applauding)

01:26:06.625 --> 01:26:09.959
- Somebody once said life is
not fair but the law should be.

01:26:09.959 --> 01:26:12.083
(cheering and applauding)

01:26:12.083 --> 01:26:13.208
And these trap laws are not fair

01:26:13.208 --> 01:26:15.333
to the women of this country.

01:26:15.333 --> 01:26:17.041
I flew in last evening
from Jackson, Mississippi.

01:26:17.041 --> 01:26:19.291
(cheering and applauding)

01:26:19.291 --> 01:26:22.667
Yesterday I saw a
woman from Louisiana.

01:26:22.667 --> 01:26:24.500
Now that state will
only have one clinic

01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:26.375
because of recent
changes in the law.

01:26:26.375 --> 01:26:28.667
She told me that she works
as a health administrator

01:26:28.667 --> 01:26:30.208
in an ER and that
they were seeing

01:26:30.208 --> 01:26:32.792
women there with
complications from

01:26:32.792 --> 01:26:36.417
do it yourself medications
on the internet.

01:26:36.417 --> 01:26:38.041
And when I told her
I was gonna be here

01:26:38.041 --> 01:26:39.583
she said you make sure that you

01:26:39.583 --> 01:26:41.000
tell them up there what's
happening down here.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.333
(cheering and applauding)

01:26:43.333 --> 01:26:45.000
In November I want you to vote

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.458
as if women's lives depend
on it because they will.

01:26:47.458 --> 01:26:50.834
(cheering and applauding)

01:26:50.834 --> 01:26:54.959
(contemplative music)

01:27:06.291 --> 01:27:08.375
- I think they'll be fair.

01:27:08.375 --> 01:27:09.667
But at the same time
of course we know

01:27:09.667 --> 01:27:11.375
that this won't be
the end of anything.

01:27:11.375 --> 01:27:12.750
Soon as you're too happy and say

01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:17.708
okay this is great, there
just come something else.

01:27:17.708 --> 01:27:20.834
(contemplative music)

01:27:29.542 --> 01:27:33.917
♪ Have you been to Jesus
for his cleansing power

01:27:33.917 --> 01:27:38.250
♪ Are you washed in
the blood of the lamb

01:27:38.250 --> 01:27:41.291
♪ Are you fully trusting

01:27:41.291 --> 01:27:45.500
♪ Are you washed in
the blood of the lamb

01:27:54.625 --> 01:27:56.208
- [Barbara] We understand
that, we're okay.

01:27:56.208 --> 01:27:59.041
♪ Are you washed are you washed

01:27:59.041 --> 01:28:00.834
♪ In the blood in the blood

- Okay we're on go here.

01:28:17.458 --> 01:28:19.250
(applauding)

01:28:19.250 --> 01:28:21.291
I'm Barbara Beavers,
and we are just

01:28:21.291 --> 01:28:23.542
so blessed to have
each of you here.

01:28:23.542 --> 01:28:26.417
We have a part to play
in ending abortion.

01:28:26.417 --> 01:28:30.333
The CPC can be there
when a young woman

01:28:30.333 --> 01:28:32.750
finds out for the first
time that she's pregnant.

01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:37.291
She's terrified, and she's
dead set on having an abortion.

01:28:37.291 --> 01:28:39.000
And because of your investment

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.125
that mother can make a decision

01:28:40.125 --> 01:28:42.667
to save the life of her child.

01:28:45.417 --> 01:28:48.333
We want to offer
hope to more women

01:28:48.333 --> 01:28:50.875
who are open to
receiving that hope.

01:28:50.875 --> 01:28:52.583
And the closer you
can get the CPC to

01:28:52.583 --> 01:28:55.000
the abortion clinic,
then the closer you can

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.625
get a woman to choose
life for her child.

01:28:57.625 --> 01:29:01.333
Having a place just
walking distance is huge.

01:29:01.333 --> 01:29:02.375
Because a lot of times
these women are dropped off.

01:29:02.375 --> 01:29:05.625
That's the greatest
need for the CPC to be

01:29:05.625 --> 01:29:10.208
as close as to that abortion
clinic as we can get it.

01:29:10.208 --> 01:29:13.041
Please consider how you
might partner with us

01:29:13.041 --> 01:29:17.041
so that hand in hand through
the power of Jesus Christ

01:29:17.041 --> 01:29:20.000
we might walk through
those doors together.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.417
(applauding)

01:29:42.291 --> 01:29:45.708
You take a flower, from me.

01:29:45.708 --> 01:29:47.625
- I was thinking
when you was talking.

01:29:47.625 --> 01:29:49.083
I want to come to the center
and help since I don't--

01:29:49.083 --> 01:29:51.083
- Okay, okay.

01:29:52.166 --> 01:29:54.667
- Maybe tell my story too.

01:29:54.667 --> 01:29:56.708
- Yeah, yeah, good, good.

01:29:59.208 --> 01:30:00.417
Oh bless you.

01:30:03.917 --> 01:30:08.166
Oh thank goodness, with that
all happening I was in favor.

01:30:09.542 --> 01:30:12.750
(contemplative music)

01:30:13.305 --> 01:30:19.804
