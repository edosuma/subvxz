Good morning, Sabrina.

01:10.583 --> 01:12.332
Hi, Mrs. Reese.
It's so nice to see you again.

01:12.333 --> 01:15.124
You too. I'm excited
to see what you've prepared.

01:15.125 --> 01:17.040
Okay.

01:17.041 --> 01:19.708
The furniture's
sleek lines balance

01:19.709 --> 01:22.207
the curve of
the natural elements.

01:22.208 --> 01:24.791
I don't see my family's
heirloom throw pillows.

01:24.792 --> 01:26.040
Where are those going to go?

01:26.041 --> 01:28.374
Well, look
at the aesthetic clarity.

01:28.375 --> 01:30.416
It's much cleaner
and more balanced

01:30.417 --> 01:31.666
without the additional throw.

01:31.667 --> 01:33.124
I just don't see
the unique elements

01:33.125 --> 01:34.749
of this design of yours.

01:34.750 --> 01:36.958
The couch is already
a statement piece.

01:36.959 --> 01:38.999
I see.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.040
Sabrina, can I speak
with you privately?

01:42.041 --> 01:43.791

to succeed more than I do.

02:18.041 --> 02:21.290

they're textbook.

02:21.291 --> 02:23.207

unique point of view?

02:23.208 --> 02:26.499
What makes this
an Olivia Wilson original?

02:26.500 --> 02:29.249
Well, I... I always
include the white shag rug.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.791
I mean, that's kind
of my signature.

02:30.792 --> 02:32.749
Olivia, you have so much talent,

02:32.750 --> 02:36.332
but bottom line,
these designs lack heart.

02:36.333 --> 02:38.791
A good designer
follows the rules.

a little piece of herself

02:49.792 --> 02:52.791
I'm sorry, but I really think
that the biggest gift

02:52.792 --> 02:56.250

he just... he had
to run to a quick meeting,

12:22.083 --> 12:23.916
but he said that you'd be
helping us move today?

12:23.917 --> 12:25.666
Oh, no, I was actually
just gonna stay here

12:25.667 --> 12:26.791
and do some paperwork.

12:26.792 --> 12:28.082
That's what I used to do.

12:28.083 --> 12:31.165
We could really use your help.
Okay.

12:31.166 --> 12:34.332
Great.

No, I just haven't done it

12:58.709 --> 13:00.374

What do we do?

13:00.375 --> 13:02.207

Everything you've done here
in the community,

14:22.834 --> 14:24.332
it's really remarkable.

You guys have been here for...
for how long, 25 years?

14:27.291 --> 14:28.791
That's right.
That is a long time

14:28.792 --> 14:30.624

14:30.625 --> 14:32.457
We really value
that kind of commitment.

14:32.458 --> 14:34.958
You know, I appreciate
your kind words, Mr. Fuller,

14:34.959 --> 14:38.624
but I'm just not sure
where you're going with this.

14:38.625 --> 14:43.457
Well, I have some good news.

14:43.458 --> 14:46.332
Acme is in a very rare position
right now.

14:46.333 --> 14:48.082
We have the means

14:48.083 --> 14:50.290
to make very generous offers

14:50.291 --> 14:52.249
to smaller businesses,

14:52.250 --> 14:55.332
and we would like to
buy Wilson Family Movers.

14:55.333 --> 14:58.332
Well, I'm not looking to sell,
and Acme,

14:58.333 --> 14:59.833
it seems like a-a fine company,

14:59.834 --> 15:03.082
but, well, Wilson Movers,

15:03.083 --> 15:04.499
well, we're a family outfit.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.999
And look,
I understand that, really.

15:07.000 --> 15:12.249
I do, but small companies like
yours are losing the market.

15:12.250 --> 15:16.499
Consumers only care
about speed and convenience.

15:16.500 --> 15:19.833

so important to them

23:14.625 --> 23:16.374
first... well,

23:16.375 --> 23:19.916
first apartments, first houses,
new business ventures.

23:19.917 --> 23:22.124
And we always say
that every move was

23:22.125 --> 23:25.082
and is a new beginning,
a new possibility,

23:25.083 --> 23:27.332
and it is truly an honor

23:27.333 --> 23:29.332
to have been able
to be a part of that,

23:29.333 --> 23:31.999
and speaking of what matters
most, my beautiful,

23:32.000 --> 23:34.833
if I must say,
daughter Olivia is here.

23:34.834 --> 23:37.457
She's visiting from the Big Apple.

23:37.458 --> 23:38.874
She ll be here for a while,

23:38.875 --> 23:41.165
and I just want her
to say hello to everybody.

23:41.166 --> 23:44.207
Give a big wave, sweetie.
Isn't she beautiful?

23:44.208 --> 23:46.207
Okay, anyway,
thank you, everybody.

23:46.208 --> 23:48.416
Thank you for coming out
to celebrate with us,

23:48.417 --> 23:51.165
and what we say now
is let's enjoy this party!

23:51.166 --> 23:53.083
(APPLAUSE)
Yes.

23:58.500 --> 24:01.040
Most people clean up
after the party is over.

24:01.041 --> 24:03.708
Here. Let me help.

24:03.709 --> 24:06.416
Thanks.

24:06.417 --> 24:10.124
So what brought you
to Sierra Verde?

24:10.125 --> 24:13.124
Uh, my grandma, actually.

24:13.125 --> 24:16.374
I want to look out for her, so I
moved in with her for a while.

24:16.375 --> 24:19.833
Initially, the plan was
to save up money for law school,

24:19.834 --> 24:21.416
but things happen, you know?

24:21.417 --> 24:23.874
Is that still the plan,
to become a lawyer?

24:23.875 --> 24:25.958
I don't know. We ll see.

24:25.959 --> 24:28.541
What about you?
Interior design is your passion?

24:28.542 --> 24:32.374
Absolutely. I love it.
That's awesome.

24:32.375 --> 24:33.999
I hope that you can
bring this enthusiasm

24:34.000 --> 24:35.416
to the office, you know?

24:35.417 --> 24:37.582
Neil told me that you and I
are gonna be working together.

24:37.583 --> 24:39.207
I'll try not to step
on your toes.

24:39.208 --> 24:40.499
You don't need to worry
about anything.

24:40.500 --> 24:42.416
I'm a mover, so I'm used
to getting stepped on.

24:42.417 --> 24:45.916
Oh, I see.
Quite the fiesta.

24:45.917 --> 24:48.582
Oh, hey you.
Hey, I'm so sorry I'm late.

24:48.583 --> 24:50.416
Book club got a little
heated tonight.

24:50.417 --> 24:52.916
Oh.
Hi. I'm Heather.

24:52.917 --> 24:56.416
Olivia.
Oh, this is Neil's daughter.

24:56.417 --> 24:57.582
Oh.
Yeah.

24:57.583 --> 24:59.416
Oh, okay.
It's so nice to meet you.

24:59.417 --> 25:00.666
You too.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.583
Oh.

25:04.667 --> 25:07.958
Do you think
Neil's gonna retire soon?

25:07.959 --> 25:09.290
I don't know.

25:09.291 --> 25:13.207
No better person to take
over the company than you.

25:13.208 --> 25:17.249
Well, I mean, let's not jump
the gun here, okay?

25:17.250 --> 25:19.374
Pete has a real passion for it.

25:19.375 --> 25:22.207
Yeah, but you're great
with all the legal stuff.

25:22.208 --> 25:23.958
Neil loves you for that.

25:23.959 --> 25:25.999
Plus, he didn't put Pete
in charge while he was gone.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.499
He put you.

25:27.500 --> 25:29.916
I'm not even sure this is what
I want to be doing long-term.

25:29.917 --> 25:31.999
Well, you're not
gonna be doing this.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.416
You're gonna be
a business owner,

25:34.417 --> 25:36.040
and then we can start
living our lives.

25:36.041 --> 25:37.958
I thought we were
living our lives.

25:37.959 --> 25:40.958
No, you know what I mean,
take the next step.

25:50.333 --> 25:52.833
Yeah, sorry to call so late.
I know you're three hours ahead.

25:52.834 --> 25:54.374
Lucky for you I'm a night owl.

25:54.375 --> 25:56.582
So how was the party?

25:56.583 --> 25:58.499
Did you meet any guys?

25:58.500 --> 26:02.124
Ugh, definitely not.
That's a bummer.

26:02.125 --> 26:04.708
No, it's fine.

26:04.709 --> 26:07.332
Well, in other news,
my dad's leaving me

26:07.333 --> 26:08.833
in charge of the company
while he goes away.

26:08.834 --> 26:12.791
That's kind of a big deal,
doing that all by yourself.

26:12.792 --> 26:16.165
Not entirely by myself.

26:16.166 --> 26:18.416
(SOFT MUSIC)

26:18.417 --> 26:21.791
Okay. Hey, thanks for coming
in early today, guys.

26:21.792 --> 26:23.416
I really appreciate it.

26:23.417 --> 26:25.165
I have got to leave for my trip
in a few minutes here.

26:25.166 --> 26:29.749
So as a thank-you,
breakfast burritos on the house.

26:29.750 --> 26:33.749
Mr. Craig, Scott,
and no-peppers Pete.

26:33.750 --> 26:35.666
Now, this is a professional,
gentlemen. Take note.

26:35.667 --> 26:37.082
Thanks, Dad.
How are you?

26:37.083 --> 26:39.332
So that's really what
you're gonna be wearing?

26:39.333 --> 26:41.332
I thought you learned
that moving's a dirty job.

26:41.333 --> 26:43.082
Yeah, I did, but, you know,

26:43.083 --> 26:44.708
I just figured
I'd stick around here today.

26:44.709 --> 26:46.374
I like it.
That's a great idea.

26:46.375 --> 26:47.666
Okay, Olivia will be in charge

26:47.667 --> 26:49.165
of the office, paperwork,
etcetera.

26:49.166 --> 26:52.708
Scott, you ll be in charge
of the moves. Sound good?

26:52.709 --> 26:55.124
That sounds good.
We got work to do.

26:55.125 --> 26:56.833
Oh, before I forget,
the accountant is gonna be here

26:56.834 --> 26:58.749
in the next couple of weeks
to work on the taxes,

26:58.750 --> 27:01.791
and I can't find the file
with last year's receipts.

27:01.792 --> 27:03.749
Could you please take a look?
It's a lot of papers,

27:03.750 --> 27:05.374
but I promise
they're in there somewhere.

27:05.375 --> 27:08.040
Yes, I'll handle it.
Thanks, sweetie.

27:08.041 --> 27:10.040
You're gonna do great.
I'm really excited about this.

27:10.041 --> 27:12.541
Have fun on your trip.
I promise.

27:12.542 --> 27:14.249
Oh, thank you for doing this.
I love you.

I love you too.

27:20.917 --> 27:23.374
He doesn't want to sell, Dave.

27:23.375 --> 27:24.624
He won't budge.

27:24.625 --> 27:27.666
Relax, Rob.
You're still establishing roots.

27:27.667 --> 27:30.332
I'm only supposed to be here
to set up shop.

27:30.333 --> 27:34.332
I can't move on until we've
absolved all our competition.

27:34.333 --> 27:37.416
All right, okay. I think
I got a connection who can help.

27:37.417 --> 27:38.791
I'll be in touch.

27:38.792 --> 27:41.499
Wilson Family Movers
is going down.

27:41.500 --> 27:43.833
They might as well go ahead
and start packing their bags.

27:43.834 --> 27:45.750
True story, baby.

27:50.333 --> 27:52.791
Where's Craig and Pete?

27:52.792 --> 27:55.958
All the moves were
canceled today, so...

27:55.959 --> 27:58.457
Oh. Does that happen a lot?

27:58.458 --> 28:01.541
More and more now
that Acme's prices are lower.

28:01.542 --> 28:03.249
So what do we do now?

28:03.250 --> 28:05.708
There is nothing much to do.

28:05.709 --> 28:08.165
Should we check the inventory?
Done.

28:08.166 --> 28:10.207
Wash the trucks?
They are so clean you could

28:10.208 --> 28:12.040
eat off of them,
and I filled up the tanks too.

28:12.041 --> 28:16.332
Why don't you take a seat,
relax, put your feet up?

28:16.333 --> 28:19.958
No. Um, I think I'm gonna
start reorganizing the office.

in here, huh?

That is not organized chaos.

28:47.250 --> 28:49.791
That is just chaos-chaos.

28:49.792 --> 28:51.499
All right, well,
if you need me, I'm right here.

28:51.500 --> 28:56.499
Thanks, but, you know, I do
my best work when I'm alone.

28:56.500 --> 28:57.749
You know what?

28:57.750 --> 28:59.040
Why don't you just take
the rest of the day off?

28:59.041 --> 29:00.499
Mm, I don't know about that.

29:00.500 --> 29:03.999
Neil asked me to watch over the
moves and to look out for you.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.791
Oh, I'm fine. As you said,
there aren't any moves today.

29:07.792 --> 29:10.999
I got this, okay?
See you tomorrow?

29:11.000 --> 29:13.999
Okay.
Great.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.999
Don't work too hard, now.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.499
I never understood
that expression.

29:19.500 --> 29:21.833
If one's gonna work,
might as well work hard.

29:21.834 --> 29:24.666
What's wrong with working
hard, anyway?

29:24.667 --> 29:26.583
Nothing.

29:30.542 --> 29:32.833
Okay, so I have
this new girl from work.

29:32.834 --> 29:34.874
Her name is Lily.
She's really pretty,

29:34.875 --> 29:37.207
and she has tons
of interests and hobbies.

29:37.208 --> 29:39.749
Will she laugh at my jokes?
Well, that's to be determined.

29:39.750 --> 29:40.791
Okay.

29:40.792 --> 29:43.290
All right, so who do
you have for me?

29:43.291 --> 29:45.457
I met this guy, Andrew,
the other day at yoga class,

29:45.458 --> 29:46.791
seems cool.

29:46.792 --> 29:48.249
He's really spiritual, and, um...

29:48.250 --> 29:49.874
But is he a good person?

29:49.875 --> 29:53.207
I just want someone who's gonna
respect me and care about me.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.958
Look, there's no way that
any guy in his right mind

29:54.959 --> 29:57.040
would not care about you.
You're amazing.

29:57.041 --> 29:59.959
Okay, you can have a bite.

We don't get to do this.

30:42.041 --> 30:44.249
going on at the office
right now, so...

30:44.250 --> 30:46.666
How are things
with Neil's daughter?

30:46.667 --> 30:48.374
Is she trying to take charge
over there?

30:48.375 --> 30:52.249
She's just there temporarily.
She's an interior designer.

30:52.250 --> 30:56.541
Have you ever thought
about working at Acme?

30:56.542 --> 30:58.624
I saw an ad that they're hiring,

30:58.625 --> 31:00.124
and they're looking
for more employees.

31:00.125 --> 31:01.624
That would be
such a good job for you.

31:01.625 --> 31:03.290
It would be such a step up.

31:08.166 --> 31:10.249

31:10.250 --> 31:14.791

at following through with them.

Why don't you give her a call?

that I have faith in her, so...

33:59.458 --> 34:00.958
and just...
things get out of hand.

34:00.959 --> 34:01.959

every week

34:01.960 --> 34:03.416
for the last 40 years.

I mean, you can't just go
through people's personal

34:04.625 --> 34:06.040
belongings
and trash them, Olivia.

34:06.041 --> 34:07.791
Where's my signed
baseball collection?

34:07.792 --> 34:10.498
It was making your desk
look small and cluttered,

34:10.500 --> 34:12.248
and it's not
a good work environment,

34:12.250 --> 34:15.123
so I just put them
in that box under your desk.

34:15.125 --> 34:16.125
Look, why don't you talk to us

34:16.126 --> 34:17.833
before you started
making these changes?

34:17.833 --> 34:20.291

a little intrusive

35:04.000 --> 35:06.416
to go through somebody's
desk without asking?

35:06.417 --> 35:08.374
No, I was just trying
to get things organized.

in moving trucks?

(CHUCKLES)

35:23.166 --> 35:25.083
I used to.

35:26.834 --> 35:29.541
When I was eight years
old I stormed out of my room,

35:29.542 --> 35:31.457
and I said I was
running away forever,

35:31.458 --> 35:33.541
and I ended up just camping out

35:33.542 --> 35:35.124
in Annabel
for a couple of hours,

35:35.125 --> 35:38.374
and then I went crawling back
into my Mom's arms.

35:38.375 --> 35:41.666
This truck has a name?
They all do.

35:41.667 --> 35:43.207
Annabel is my favorite though.

35:43.208 --> 35:47.207
There's Dillard, Susie Q, Kitty.

35:47.208 --> 35:49.249
Kitty? Why... why is it Kitty?

35:49.250 --> 35:51.374
Because when I was
little I wanted a pet,

35:51.375 --> 35:53.332
but my Dad said
I could have a truck instead.

35:53.333 --> 35:56.250
Ah, okay.
I like his style.

to get back in there?

36:02.917 --> 36:04.749
I don't know.

36:04.750 --> 36:06.958
But you made Neil's office
all organized

36:06.959 --> 36:10.916
and smell like... what was it,
light floral notes?

36:10.917 --> 36:12.749
I don't know.

36:12.750 --> 36:16.874
It was inauthentic and textbook

36:16.875 --> 36:20.082
and cold and sterile,

36:20.083 --> 36:22.582
and that's exactly my problem,

36:22.583 --> 36:25.500

close people move in,

to be so on edge.

43:42.750 --> 43:44.916

I have been thinking

43:44.917 --> 43:46.999
about starting
my next chapter of my life,

43:47.000 --> 43:49.040

leaving the company behind,

43:49.041 --> 43:50.874

Wouldn't she want you
to be happy?

44:09.458 --> 44:11.958

44:11.959 --> 44:13.791

the next three days,

44:13.792 --> 44:17.207

take this down time to improve,

44:17.208 --> 44:18.749
gain a competitive edge,

44:18.750 --> 44:21.916

need to be prepped for go time.

just a little bit too intense.

44:25.583 --> 44:26.999
No. Okay.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.416
If we can't compete on pricing,
Acme steals our clients.

44:29.417 --> 44:32.624

and do more moves in less time.

Pete, I need to meet with you
every day for at least two hours

44:35.000 --> 44:36.290

44:42.750 --> 44:45.874
That means
the filing systems are ancient.

44:45.875 --> 44:47.582
Our setup is nothing
compared to Acme's.

44:47.583 --> 44:49.416

appointment system.

44:51.375 --> 44:53.416
You don't even have
to talk to actual people.

44:53.417 --> 44:55.249

is input the information,

44:55.250 --> 44:56.457
and the moves are set.

Look, I know you guys
don't want to do this,

You know, she's a perfectionist?

48:11.041 --> 48:12.332

48:12.333 --> 48:14.165
in her mind of how everything's
supposed to be,

48:14.166 --> 48:15.958
and it's not reality,

48:15.959 --> 48:17.708
but at the same time
it makes me feel

48:17.709 --> 48:19.916
like I haven't been doing
anything with my life,

48:19.917 --> 48:22.249

is move people's furniture.

an honest living, Scott.

to tell you this before,

I'd love to.

55:19.083 --> 55:22.666
Cool, but you may want
to change out of the pajamas

55:22.667 --> 55:25.583
because that place
isn't that casual.

55:29.417 --> 55:33.374
You know, I read
that Venus is in retrograde.

55:33.375 --> 55:36.165
(CHUCKLES)
And what does that mean?

55:36.166 --> 55:39.332
I have no idea.
I don't know. I don't know.

55:39.333 --> 55:42.124
I skim some woman magazine

55:42.125 --> 55:44.874
in the line of the grocery store
from time to time.

55:44.875 --> 55:47.582
Wh... why?

55:47.583 --> 55:50.874
Just so I-I can understand
you better.

55:50.875 --> 55:53.416
You don't have to read
a magazine to understand me.

55:53.417 --> 55:56.541
You just have to ask.

55:56.542 --> 55:59.624
Okay, then, here goes.

55:59.625 --> 56:02.958
What is it that
I should know about you?

56:02.959 --> 56:06.874
That I care very much about you,

56:06.875 --> 56:10.082
but I don't want
to be kept a secret.

56:10.083 --> 56:13.082
Hmm, that conversation again.

56:13.083 --> 56:16.165
Hey, that's not fair.

56:16.166 --> 56:19.290
We're gonna have to deal
with this sooner or later.

56:19.291 --> 56:23.290
We... we've been
going out six months.

56:23.291 --> 56:25.666
I'm starting to think
I embarrass you.

56:25.667 --> 56:28.290
No, that...
that is not how it is.

56:28.291 --> 56:29.541
I... you know what?

56:29.542 --> 56:32.416
I promise, I will tell Olivia
right when we get back.

56:32.417 --> 56:33.666
I... it's just that Olivia

56:33.667 --> 56:36.290
and her Mom have
always been two peas in a pod,

56:36.291 --> 56:39.708
and I-I just don't know
how she's gonna react

56:39.709 --> 56:42.833
when she finds out I'm in love
with another woman.

56:42.834 --> 56:47.833
You're in love with me?

57:16.000 --> 57:19.124
Thanks.

57:19.125 --> 57:23.290
All right. I think that...
I think that works.

57:23.291 --> 57:24.916
All right, coming through here.

57:24.917 --> 57:27.708
Wow.

57:27.709 --> 57:31.040
Oh, this is great.

57:31.041 --> 57:33.249
You did such a great job.
Yeah, it's really good.

57:33.250 --> 57:34.250
Craig and I are gonna head
to the truck,

57:34.251 --> 57:36.666

Yeah, that's Auntie Nolene.
Nolene Norrell?

58:06.166 --> 58:07.833
Norrell, yes, I know.

58:07.834 --> 58:09.290
When I was a little girl my Mom

58:09.291 --> 58:11.374
and I would spend hours

58:11.375 --> 58:15.290
rearranging the furniture
in the dollhouse.

58:15.291 --> 58:19.290
I know it's just my imagination,
but I could have sworn the dolls

58:19.291 --> 58:21.582
were so happy
when I redecorated their rooms.

58:21.583 --> 58:23.416
(CHUCKLES)

58:23.417 --> 58:27.916
Since then it's been
my dream to design.

58:27.917 --> 58:33.290
Well, I think your Mom would
be very proud of you right now.

58:33.291 --> 58:36.874
Well...

58:36.875 --> 58:38.750
would you look at this?

58:43.917 --> 58:47.749
It's lovely, simply lovely.

58:47.750 --> 58:49.457
Mm.

58:49.458 --> 58:51.874
It's definitely
not your house, but we wanted

58:51.875 --> 58:55.332
to make it feel like a home.

Hey, what you did for my grandma
today, it was just incredible.

59:15.667 --> 59:18.791
Oh, don't worry about it.
It's simple staging.

59:18.792 --> 59:20.165
Yeah, but I could
totally see it.

59:20.166 --> 59:21.708
I could tell you're really
good at your job.

59:21.709 --> 59:25.499
Well, my boss... my former boss

59:25.500 --> 59:27.457
says my work has no heart.

Well, then change her mind,
you know?

we both want different things.

I may actually let you win.

about it, Scott.

Guys, I told my Dad
I would fix this,

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:33.207
and the calendar
is still completely empty.

01:00:33.208 --> 01:00:35.374
You know, I've been thinking.

01:00:35.375 --> 01:00:38.999
I was thinking about
the awesome job that you did,

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.624
also what you said
about finding an advantage,

01:00:41.625 --> 01:00:44.207
and I think our advantage
is you.

01:00:44.208 --> 01:00:46.249
What do you mean?
What you did for my grandma,

01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:48.874
the staging and redesigning
of the space,

01:00:48.875 --> 01:00:51.207
I mean, that's something that
Acme could never offer.

01:00:51.208 --> 01:00:54.374
Sure, yes, we may need
to compete pricewise,

01:00:54.375 --> 01:00:58.416
but we have a person
that can create a new home.

01:00:58.417 --> 01:00:59.749
Yeah, that's... that's good.

01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:01.207
I think you're onto something, actually.

01:01:01.208 --> 01:01:03.749
But Olivia's not gonna be
in Sierra Verde much longer.

01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:05.499
Yeah, but I just listened
to Mrs. Norrell

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.499
about what was important to her,
and I-I took that,

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:09.958
and I incorporated
That into the new layout.

01:01:09.959 --> 01:01:11.791
You know... you know,
Karen works at E&K Fabrics.

01:01:11.792 --> 01:01:13.374
I mean, she's always had
an eye for design.

01:01:13.375 --> 01:01:15.082
Maybe you can... you could show
her that and show us the ropes.

01:01:15.083 --> 01:01:16.624
You know, the website deal
isn't really our thing,

01:01:16.625 --> 01:01:18.582
but I mean, we're old school.
We're old school.

01:01:18.583 --> 01:01:21.624
Yeah, so Wilson's wouldn't
just move people's things.

01:01:21.625 --> 01:01:23.791
We would help them design
their new home

01:01:23.792 --> 01:01:25.249
by using old and new items.

01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:27.165
Yes, yes.
Yeah?

just move people out.

Hi.

01:17:03.875 --> 01:17:06.040
What's going on?
Getting acquainted?

01:17:06.041 --> 01:17:08.457
Don't reveal too much,
hopefully not too honest.

Oh, he's visiting his grandma,

01:17:11.834 --> 01:17:13.541
probably playing bingo
or something.

01:17:13.542 --> 01:17:16.374
Yeah, she's loving it
at Golden Meadows for sure.

01:17:16.375 --> 01:17:19.290
Oh, that makes me so happy.
We're actually headed

01:17:19.291 --> 01:17:21.040
to Brandy Rose Tavern later on
if you want to come.

01:17:21.041 --> 01:17:22.207
I think he ll be there.

01:17:22.208 --> 01:17:24.708
Oh, yeah, I'll try to stop by.
All right.

01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:26.833
So you have to leave tomorrow?

01:17:26.834 --> 01:17:30.290
Yeah, I do,
but I'll visit more frequently.

01:21:31.291 --> 01:21:33.165
and thank you
all so much for coming.

01:21:33.166 --> 01:21:36.958
I am Sabrina Furst
of Sabrina Furst Interiors.

01:21:36.959 --> 01:21:38.749
We'd like to thank the Atlantic

01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:40.958
for the wonderful opportunity

01:21:40.959 --> 01:21:42.958
to design their beautiful,

01:21:42.959 --> 01:21:44.708
brand-new restaurant.

01:21:44.709 --> 01:21:47.207
I'd also like to
introduce Olivia Wilson.

01:21:47.208 --> 01:21:49.040
She is our lead design on this,

01:21:49.041 --> 01:21:50.833
and she can speak more
to the vision.

01:21:50.834 --> 01:21:53.624
Olivia?
(APPLAUSE)

01:21:53.625 --> 01:21:56.499
Thank you, Sabrina,
and thank you to the Atlantic

01:21:56.500 --> 01:22:01.374
for letting us be a part of this
wonderful transformation.

01:22:01.375 --> 01:22:03.874
What we designed is...
is not just a restaurant.

01:22:03.875 --> 01:22:06.874
It's what I like to call
the living room.

01:22:06.875 --> 01:22:08.624
What's important about a space?

01:22:08.625 --> 01:22:11.958
It's not just the lines,
the colors,

01:22:11.959 --> 01:22:14.958
or the way the light
comes through the windows.

01:22:14.959 --> 01:22:18.833
What's most important
is that it feels like home

01:22:18.834 --> 01:22:20.332
and it resonates with you.

01:22:20.333 --> 01:22:23.624
With that said,
we've incorporated objects

01:22:23.625 --> 01:22:26.165
from the old layout
as a way to pay tribute

01:22:26.166 --> 01:22:28.541
to the former
Atlantic Restaurant,

01:22:28.542 --> 01:22:31.541
a mixture of staging and design.

01:22:31.542 --> 01:22:35.332
We wanted the restaurant
to feel warm and comfortable,

01:22:35.333 --> 01:22:38.250
your home away from home.

01:22:41.709 --> 01:22:43.916
We know how important that is.

01:22:43.917 --> 01:22:45.582
Scattered throughout
the restaurant

01:22:45.583 --> 01:22:49.124
we have old family photos
of the owners

01:22:49.125 --> 01:22:50.666
and the employees,

01:22:50.667 --> 01:22:54.249
making it even more
welcoming and familiar.

01:22:54.250 --> 01:22:58.207
So with that said, please enjoy

01:22:58.208 --> 01:22:59.958
and have a seat
in our living room.
