00:27.440 --> 00:28.560
No.

00:31.680 --> 00:33.600
No, no, no. I have...

00:33.600 --> 00:35.480
I have very serious reservat...

00:40.440 --> 00:43.440
I have very serious
reservations about meeting again.

00:53.280 --> 00:54.800
Yeah.

00:54.800 --> 00:56.000
Fine.

00:57.520 --> 00:58.960
All right.

01:03.160 --> 01:06.560
Lunchtime. St James's Park.

01:06.560 --> 01:09.640
The, erm, the, uh, the bench by
the Horse Guards Parade. - Mm-hm.

01:13.080 --> 01:15.040
Then that is the end of it.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.800
Do you have chilblains?
- Er, yes.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.920
Well, blame underfeeding.

02:04.920 --> 02:07.920
Poor clothing and poor
circulation play a part.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.479
Tight boots and warming the hands

02:09.479 --> 02:12.080
and feet at the fire when
they are cold encourage them.

02:45.920 --> 02:52.200
♪ There is mean things
happening in this land

02:52.200 --> 02:57.880

04:37.640 --> 04:39.520
Oh, let's just stop.

04:41.560 --> 04:43.920
That didn't go very well, did it?

04:43.920 --> 04:46.080
You're very clearly rattled.

04:46.080 --> 04:48.120
Well, one would be rattled,
wouldn't one?

04:48.120 --> 04:50.320
You're flinching from me
like I'm an actual Nazi

04:50.320 --> 04:51.680
about to cut off your fingers.

04:51.680 --> 04:54.080
I was flinching because
you have very bad breath.

04:55.440 --> 04:57.560
Hold out your hand.

04:57.560 --> 04:58.880
This was my first time.

04:58.880 --> 05:00.440
I get to have another try, don't I?

05:03.040 --> 05:05.400
Telephone call for you, Brigadier.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.320
What are you smiling about?

05:10.040 --> 05:13.000
Hey, Feef, you OK? You did good.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.480
Hm?

05:14.480 --> 05:19.200
The war is over? I can't believe it.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.800
And how long do you think
it will take before

05:21.800 --> 05:23.440
I have an American accent?

05:23.440 --> 05:26.280
What? After I get to Iowa.

05:26.280 --> 05:28.480
I don't think my wife
will like you very much.

05:32.280 --> 05:34.200
I don't want the war to be over.

05:35.320 --> 05:36.880
Me neither.

05:38.360 --> 05:42.440
Oh, we're the worst two people
in the world.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.600
Was I going to be an agent?

05:44.600 --> 05:46.440
Probably.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.960
Mm, I'm not terribly good
at being interrogated.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.760
Most people aren't good at it
the first time.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.920
That's why they call it training.

05:57.240 --> 06:00.080
Now I won't be parachuting into France.

06:01.960 --> 06:07.480
Can't hide messages in bicycles
and operate a secret radio,

06:07.480 --> 06:10.080
blow up bridges.

06:10.080 --> 06:12.680
And I'll have to leave this
land of umbrella stands

06:12.680 --> 06:15.240
and knitted little hats for teapots.

06:16.960 --> 06:20.400
What will you miss most?
The bad food or the bad weather?

06:29.280 --> 06:31.440
Say I'm going with you.

06:33.240 --> 06:35.120
Just lie.

06:37.760 --> 06:40.320
You're coming with me.

06:40.320 --> 06:42.080
To America.

07:19.600 --> 07:23.360
Come on, Peter! No, you first.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.880
Come on.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.840
Drop her off, then I'll go on.

07:43.160 --> 07:45.520
Can I see a picture of your wife?

07:45.520 --> 07:48.080
It'll be easier for me if I understand

07:48.080 --> 07:50.040
you're back where you're supposed to be.

08:01.880 --> 08:03.920
Tell Jackson.

08:03.920 --> 08:06.360
Jackson, the war is over.

08:06.360 --> 08:09.120
You can go home.

08:09.120 --> 08:11.160
We can have the lights on now.

08:23.120 --> 08:25.720
Whatever it takes!

08:28.120 --> 08:31.200
Wanted to talk to you about someone,
a girl.

08:31.200 --> 08:36.360
Clever, keen,
still interested in adrenalising work.

08:36.360 --> 08:39.760
Mm, for who? For us? Maybe.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.200
Maybe?

08:41.200 --> 08:42.360
Haven't approached her.

08:42.360 --> 08:44.920
Thought I'd talk to you,
see if you have a spot for her.

08:44.920 --> 08:48.960
She's intelligent, pretty,
talks perfect French.

08:48.960 --> 08:51.960
Oh, yeah? That fight's over.

08:51.960 --> 08:54.920
Does she talk Russian?

08:54.920 --> 09:01.520
Not as far as I know, but she loves
America. Loves, uh, Americans.

09:01.520 --> 09:03.280
Trained?

09:03.280 --> 09:04.560
Mostly.

09:04.560 --> 09:06.440
Disappointed she never got to serve.

09:06.440 --> 09:09.680
A mostly trained French
speaker you're fucking.

09:09.680 --> 09:10.880
Thanks for the tip.

09:10.880 --> 09:13.400
Seems a waste just to
let her be a bureaucrat

09:13.400 --> 09:16.360
in the civil service or whatever.

09:16.360 --> 09:18.880
The civil service? That's perfect.

09:18.880 --> 09:20.360
Yes.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.560
The SOE suggested she apply.

09:28.960 --> 09:35.640
Imagine, if you will, an island through
which a terrible storm has passed.

09:35.640 --> 09:39.040
Prior to the storm there were huts
made from the plentiful supply

09:39.040 --> 09:42.880
of palm trees that grow
at the edge of the shore.

09:42.880 --> 09:47.880
The island's canoes, also made
from palms, have been destroyed.

09:47.880 --> 09:51.480
The island's church and schoolhouse,
established by unpopular Christian

09:51.480 --> 09:54.560
missionaries, have also been destroyed.

09:54.560 --> 09:57.960
There are only enough surviving
palm trees to house 30 families.

09:57.960 --> 10:00.960
There is another island, uninhabited,

10:00.960 --> 10:03.240
approximately a
seven-hour canoe ride away.

10:03.240 --> 10:06.360
Yet a third island which is
inhabited, approximately

10:06.360 --> 10:09.000
a 12-hour canoe ride away.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.280
One canoe can take two adults
and requires a single palm tree.

10:13.280 --> 10:17.680
All three islands are British protectorates.

10:17.680 --> 10:21.040
Another storm is due to batter
the island in three days' time

10:21.040 --> 10:24.440
and may be worse than the last.

10:24.440 --> 10:27.360
You are in charge.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.040
What do you do?

10:29.040 --> 10:33.440
How significant is the language
barrier? I need a translator.

10:33.440 --> 10:35.640
There's the missionaries.

10:35.640 --> 10:39.000
If everyone hates the missionaries,
they're the last people we should use.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.280
How did I get there and
did it involve an aeroplane?

10:41.280 --> 10:43.920
Because I think an aeroplane
would be quite useful.

10:47.200 --> 10:51.320
On your original application,
you wrote you were particularly drawn

10:51.320 --> 10:53.400
to the civil service for
the possibility of travel,

10:53.400 --> 10:57.680
which I took to be a not-so-subtle
hint that your real area of interest

10:57.680 --> 11:01.600
is simply the Foreign Office and
the opportunity it affords for...

11:01.600 --> 11:03.040
Well, for gadding about.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.480
Well, I do like the idea of travel.

11:07.480 --> 11:09.960
It's actually an incredibly
exciting time to be at home.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.960
The country has been flattened, rather.

11:11.960 --> 11:13.400
Now we rebuild.

11:13.400 --> 11:14.760
Exciting.

11:14.760 --> 11:16.800
Would you have any moral compunction

11:16.800 --> 11:19.320
if you were to be serving
under a socialist government?

11:20.520 --> 11:22.720
No. But you yourself are...

11:22.720 --> 11:25.360
You do not need to state
your political allegiance.

11:25.360 --> 11:27.280
I'm a Tory.

11:27.280 --> 11:29.120
But, if Mr Attlee comes to power,

11:29.120 --> 11:31.520
it will be our duty to serve his government.

11:31.520 --> 11:32.920
He won't come to power.

11:32.920 --> 11:35.120
Elected on the basis that
the poor in this country

11:35.120 --> 11:37.120
have had to put up with
a damn lot. Language.

11:37.120 --> 11:40.800
And... won't take any more.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.080
And we must serve them with alacrity.

11:43.080 --> 11:46.080
The point is we are neutral.

11:46.080 --> 11:49.320
Of course.

11:49.320 --> 11:52.360
If you aren't accepted here,
what will you do?

11:55.560 --> 11:57.440
Anything but go home again.

12:04.560 --> 12:06.400
How's the family?

12:06.400 --> 12:08.480
Yeah, good.

12:15.440 --> 12:16.960
The girl you like.

12:16.960 --> 12:19.320
The other girl.

12:19.320 --> 12:21.200
She's in.

12:36.200 --> 12:39.120
I want to know more about her.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.680
Money?

12:41.680 --> 12:44.480
Her family need it, uh,
but she has a complicated relationship

12:44.480 --> 12:46.080
with them, so...

12:46.080 --> 12:47.200
Ideology?

12:47.200 --> 12:48.440
Basically a Tory.

12:48.440 --> 12:49.800
Not a zealot.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.480
Compromise? Coercion?

12:53.080 --> 12:56.320
Her brother's probably a homosexual.

12:56.320 --> 12:57.720
Ego?

12:57.720 --> 12:59.240
Adventure.

12:59.240 --> 13:00.960
That's the ticket with her.

13:03.440 --> 13:04.440
Let her settle in.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.400
Then we make our move.

13:20.145 --> 13:22.065
The civil service?

13:22.065 --> 13:23.785
Sorry, I don't understand.

13:23.785 --> 13:25.785
You're going to be a secretary?

13:25.785 --> 13:28.305
Why can't you just meet someone?

13:28.305 --> 13:31.585
Even Freddie has
managed to meet someone.

13:31.585 --> 13:33.425
Well, he had to,
otherwise people would talk.

13:33.425 --> 13:34.865
Shut up, Feef.

13:34.865 --> 13:37.025
Honestly, she doesn't know
anything about anything

13:37.025 --> 13:39.225
and then tries to hide it by talking too much.

13:45.665 --> 13:46.945
Something wrong with the meat?

13:48.665 --> 13:50.425
I'm vegetarian.

13:50.425 --> 13:52.065
What?!

13:52.065 --> 13:54.585
I'm sorry, I'm vegetarian.

13:54.585 --> 13:56.585
I don't eat meat.

14:00.585 --> 14:04.305
Hugh is a very fine solicitor
and I think will be instrumental

14:04.305 --> 14:07.705
as you make decisions about the house.

14:07.705 --> 14:11.425
Fucking army used the east wing as
a barracks and treated it appallingly.

14:11.425 --> 14:16.225
You will seek compensation
and then fix the bloody roof.

14:16.225 --> 14:20.305
We'll present you with a variety of options.

14:20.305 --> 14:23.025
Including a tax haven.

14:23.025 --> 14:24.585
Always wise.

14:24.585 --> 14:26.505
A little wiser if the socialists get in.

14:26.505 --> 14:27.865
Not that there's a chance of that.

14:27.865 --> 14:30.585
Freddie's going to replace
me in the Commons.

14:30.585 --> 14:32.785
I shall take my seat in the Lords.

14:32.785 --> 14:34.585
Good luck in the election.

14:34.585 --> 14:35.865
Thank you.

14:35.865 --> 14:38.945
I'm also running
- for the Labour Party.

14:40.385 --> 14:41.505
Mm.

14:41.505 --> 14:43.585
You're running for Labour?

14:45.505 --> 14:47.945
They've got no hope.

14:47.945 --> 14:51.065
Congratulations. What for?

14:51.065 --> 14:53.305
For irritating my father and brother.

14:53.305 --> 14:55.145
Seems fairly easily done.

14:58.065 --> 15:01.865
If you're a socialist, why are you
fiddling my father's taxes anyway?

15:01.865 --> 15:04.585
Don't you want all his
money to go to the poor?

15:04.585 --> 15:08.065
Uh, well, I can only afford my principles

15:08.065 --> 15:09.705
on my day off, unfortunately.

15:12.025 --> 15:14.585
Actually, there is no
fiddling your father's taxes.

15:17.065 --> 15:21.345
So, what will you tell Daddy tomorrow?

15:21.345 --> 15:24.785
The cheapest option is
to demolish the house.

15:29.065 --> 15:30.945
Gosh.

15:30.945 --> 15:34.065
When someone says something like
that you expect the sky to fall down

15:34.065 --> 15:35.305
or something, don't you?

15:35.305 --> 15:38.225
I'm sorry.

15:38.225 --> 15:41.305
Want to go swimming?

15:41.305 --> 15:42.785
It's not that hot.

15:42.785 --> 15:45.225
But I always swim when I'm home.

16:04.225 --> 16:06.025
Come on.

16:06.025 --> 16:08.225
Let's just celebrate the end of the war.

16:11.865 --> 16:15.145
You swim, I'll wait.

16:17.305 --> 16:18.785
Don't bother.

16:36.425 --> 16:37.865
And when do you leave us for London?

16:37.865 --> 16:39.145
This afternoon.

16:39.145 --> 16:40.585
Oh, how terribly exciting.

16:40.585 --> 16:44.145
Oh, good morning, Mrs Herbert.
Lovely to see you.

16:45.785 --> 16:47.425
And you've arranged accommodation?

16:47.425 --> 16:50.025
Yes, staying with a
college friend initially. Mm.

16:50.025 --> 16:51.785
I think we're about done here.

16:51.785 --> 16:53.425
But it's only 11, Freddie.

16:53.425 --> 16:54.665
Yes, I know, but I'm hungry.

16:54.665 --> 16:56.785
There's some meat at the
butcher's. I bought it up.

16:56.785 --> 16:58.505
We can have it for lunch.

17:00.225 --> 17:02.505
Can I induce you to
wear one of these, Vicar?

17:02.505 --> 17:04.865
Ah, no.

17:18.585 --> 17:20.785
Are you sure this is all right?

17:20.785 --> 17:22.785
Plenty of room for all of us.

17:37.505 --> 17:40.025
What's going on?!

17:40.025 --> 17:41.585
I don't know.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.865
Keep it down, would you?!

17:49.865 --> 17:51.505
What's going on?

17:51.505 --> 17:54.585
The election results are in. Who won?

17:54.585 --> 17:57.025
The bloody socialists!

17:58.785 --> 18:01.425
♪ The people's flag is deepest red

18:01.425 --> 18:03.225
♪ It shrouded oft our martyred dead

18:03.225 --> 18:05.785
♪ And ere their limbs grew stiff and cold

18:05.785 --> 18:09.065
♪ Their hearts' blood dyed to every fold

18:09.065 --> 18:12.145
♪ Then raise the scarlet standard high

18:49.785 --> 18:51.225
Hello!

18:51.225 --> 18:54.585
First day? Quite a day, good luck.

18:54.585 --> 18:56.025
I can't believe they won.

18:56.025 --> 18:57.425
Remember your interview.

18:57.425 --> 18:59.065
We are neutral.

18:59.065 --> 19:01.225
We are neutral...

19:01.225 --> 19:03.425
This is all the data
collected so far about wood.

19:03.425 --> 19:04.745
Wood?

19:04.745 --> 19:06.145
Wood.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.505
From trees.

19:07.505 --> 19:09.065
Wood builds houses.

19:09.065 --> 19:11.425
There is, you may have
noticed, a lack of housing

19:11.425 --> 19:13.945
in the United Kingdom as a
result of the last six years.

19:13.945 --> 19:18.145
Questions that will need to be
answered. What type of wood
would be most cost-effective?

19:18.145 --> 19:20.225
Do weather conditions affect the
type of wood required and, if so,

19:20.225 --> 19:22.305
do we need to make
logistically specific decisions?

19:22.305 --> 19:24.665
Perhaps you should be
writing some of this down?

19:24.665 --> 19:27.225
From whence should we access the wood?

19:27.225 --> 19:31.945
East Germany? Scotland? Consider
political as well as practical ramifications.

19:31.945 --> 19:33.705
How much wood should
be used in comparison

19:33.705 --> 19:35.225
to other building materials?

19:35.225 --> 19:37.865
Is there a different type of
information we need to follow up on?

19:37.865 --> 19:40.105
What kind of things do
we think is important?

19:42.585 --> 19:44.225
Tonight, Peter.

19:44.225 --> 19:46.065
Make it romantic.

19:46.065 --> 19:47.665
You got it.

20:37.305 --> 20:38.865
Thank you.

20:38.865 --> 20:41.305
I heard you made it to London.

20:41.305 --> 20:42.705
I wanted to say hello.

20:42.705 --> 20:44.145
That's very kind of you.

20:44.145 --> 20:46.505
I got the distinct impression
the last time we met

20:46.505 --> 20:48.065
that you didn't really like me.

20:48.065 --> 20:49.425
Not at all.

20:49.425 --> 20:51.425
I like you very much, very much.

20:51.425 --> 20:53.745
I just, erm, my situation is...

20:53.745 --> 20:55.145
Oh, no, I was being silly.

20:55.145 --> 21:00.025
And I'd had too much to drink,
so... Anyway, congratulations.

21:00.025 --> 21:02.185
I assume you won your seat,
unlike my brother.

21:04.945 --> 21:06.145
A socialist, eh?

21:06.145 --> 21:09.745
It's going to be impossible
to get good service.

21:09.745 --> 21:11.425
Excuse me?

21:15.065 --> 21:17.385
You know I'm happy for you and everything

21:17.385 --> 21:19.865
but I don't think it says
very much for the country.

21:19.865 --> 21:22.505
Churchill single-handedly held off the Nazis.

21:22.505 --> 21:24.665
Voting him out of office
is a rather peculiar way

21:24.665 --> 21:26.425
of showing our appreciation.

21:26.425 --> 21:30.425
Churchill ran the war, Attlee ran
England, he deserves credit too.

21:30.425 --> 21:33.145
He just doesn't have quite the
same genius for self-promotion.

21:33.145 --> 21:36.305
Oh, and what a wonderful job
Attlee did on the home front.

21:36.305 --> 21:38.745
"Keep things going at home?"
Look, the lamb's off!

21:38.745 --> 21:40.185
And the beef's off.

21:40.185 --> 21:43.425
All Churchill wants for peacetime
is to go back to business as usual.

21:43.425 --> 21:45.945
Well, that's what we all want,
isn't it? With meat.

21:45.945 --> 21:48.225
Business as usual before the
war was mass unemployment

21:48.225 --> 21:50.425
and the worst slums in Europe.

21:50.425 --> 21:52.745
Obviously some lucky
people could afford meat

21:52.745 --> 21:54.425
but not as many as you might think.

21:54.425 --> 21:57.465
Depends on the circles you
travel in and how limited they are.

22:03.145 --> 22:05.945
Well, it doesn't give me much
faith in democracy, anyway.

22:05.945 --> 22:07.865
People don't know what they need.

22:07.865 --> 22:10.425
I mean, it hardly makes a
difference who's at Number Ten.

22:10.425 --> 22:13.305
Although, I heard Attlee knows
nothing about foreign policy,

22:13.305 --> 22:15.785
so God knows what the
consequences will be from that.

22:15.785 --> 22:18.425
The beef's off and the lamb's off.

22:18.425 --> 22:21.145
What a repellently overprivileged
universe you come from

22:21.145 --> 22:23.945
if you really believe a vote is
something to be thrown away

22:23.945 --> 22:25.865
over a misguided sense of politeness.

22:25.865 --> 22:28.385
Erm, can you excuse
me for a second, please?

22:28.385 --> 22:30.145
I'm going to continue being impolite

22:30.145 --> 22:32.505
and ask if you wouldn't
mind if we skip dinner.

22:32.505 --> 22:35.385
This is a special night for the
Labour Party, for the country.

22:37.665 --> 22:39.945
I'm sorry.

22:39.945 --> 22:42.465
I thought you were different.

22:59.225 --> 23:01.465
How was your first day?

23:04.225 --> 23:06.305
Unbelievably boring.

23:27.865 --> 23:29.705
Lie on me.

23:31.945 --> 23:33.865
Stay on top.

24:00.105 --> 24:02.425
You deserve to do great things.

24:02.425 --> 24:05.145
I can make that happen.

24:05.145 --> 24:06.865
I want you to meet someone.

24:27.745 --> 24:30.945
Peter tells me you had all the
makings of an excellent agent

24:30.945 --> 24:33.585
but that your career was cut short.

24:33.585 --> 24:36.785
Well, the war ended.

24:36.785 --> 24:39.225
Wars don't end.

24:39.225 --> 24:40.225
Really?

24:40.225 --> 24:44.145
Because I definitely attended
a couple of victory parties.

24:44.145 --> 24:46.585
Why did you want to be a special agent?

24:46.585 --> 24:48.385
It seemed insane to sit around and wait

24:48.385 --> 24:51.425
to see if we were going to be invaded or not.

24:51.425 --> 24:52.665
I hate passivity.

24:52.665 --> 24:54.505
So do I. So does Peter.

24:54.505 --> 24:57.025
Why sit on your ass when
you can save the world?

24:58.305 --> 25:00.665
Plus, it's fun.

25:00.665 --> 25:02.065
It's fun being an agent.

25:03.225 --> 25:06.065
So, if wars don't end,
who are we fighting now?

25:06.065 --> 25:08.225
I would phrase that question differently.

25:08.225 --> 25:09.945
Who's attacking us now?

25:09.945 --> 25:13.785
From whom must we defend ourselves?

25:13.785 --> 25:16.865
Russia's why Attlee won the election.

25:16.865 --> 25:18.225
Did you know that?

25:18.225 --> 25:19.865
Not really.

25:19.865 --> 25:22.225
Hm, doesn't it strike
you as odd that Churchill,

25:22.225 --> 25:25.145
the most heroic man of
the age and, by the way,

25:25.145 --> 25:27.305
extremely alert to the Russian threat,

25:27.305 --> 25:32.265
is ousted and suddenly
socialists rule England?

25:32.265 --> 25:35.665
Odd. Terrible. Baffling. Stupid.

25:36.945 --> 25:39.505
It was inevitable.

25:39.505 --> 25:42.305
The war left England very weak.

25:42.305 --> 25:44.945
Economically, structurally, psychologically.

25:44.945 --> 25:47.505
Weakness is always exploited.

25:47.505 --> 25:49.305
We see that in nature.

25:50.785 --> 25:56.105
Right now, Britain is absolutely
at war and the scary thing is...

25:56.105 --> 25:58.865
..she doesn't know it.

25:58.865 --> 26:01.665
We believe Whitehall has
been infiltrated by Communists.

26:03.585 --> 26:06.225
That's why I need an
agent in the civil service.

26:08.225 --> 26:10.705
But, spy on my own government?

26:10.705 --> 26:13.145
Well, there's a name for that.

26:13.145 --> 26:15.385
Peter told me you were
prepared to jump out of a plane

26:15.385 --> 26:16.705
to save your country.

26:16.705 --> 26:20.585
Yes, but, what about MI5? 6?

26:20.585 --> 26:23.305
Right now we're standing
by a statue of Lenin.

26:27.145 --> 26:32.145
England's way too slow
to recognise her enemies.

26:32.145 --> 26:35.865
People around here still call Stalin
"Uncle Joe".

26:35.865 --> 26:39.025
Let me tell you something,
"Uncle Joe"'s army raped so many women

26:39.025 --> 26:42.305
on their way to Berlin that
the orphanages have agreed

26:42.305 --> 26:45.225
to take children in whose
mothers are still alive

26:45.225 --> 26:47.185
but can't stand to see their progeny.

26:49.145 --> 26:52.225
He's another psychopath in charge
of another army of psychopaths

26:52.225 --> 26:55.305
and I'd like to stop this one
a little more effectively.

26:55.305 --> 26:59.105
Plus, if the Commies are
infiltrating the British government,

26:59.105 --> 27:00.665
we'd like to know about it.

27:01.785 --> 27:06.865
England still needs you,
it just doesn't know it.

27:06.865 --> 27:08.465
Are you in or out?

27:14.505 --> 27:17.145
Should we shake hands or something?

27:24.865 --> 27:29.345
You have to consider
moisture and movement.

27:29.345 --> 27:32.705
Great Britain is moist.

27:32.705 --> 27:34.065
It is.

27:34.065 --> 27:39.425
Moisture content has got to
match the proposed environment

27:39.425 --> 27:42.505
or there'll be splitting and warping.

27:45.065 --> 27:47.425
And what about a species?

27:47.425 --> 27:50.465
You've got to consider fungal decay.

27:51.905 --> 27:54.305
You have to.

27:54.305 --> 27:56.505
Fungal decay? Yes.

28:20.265 --> 28:22.065
Hurry up, Feef!

28:24.905 --> 28:26.625
Camilla?!

28:46.025 --> 28:48.905
Do you want to see National
Velvet this week? Harry won't come.

28:48.905 --> 28:50.265
Uh, yes, all right.

28:50.265 --> 28:51.505
Any night but Wednesday.

28:51.505 --> 28:52.905
I know you love Elizabeth Taylor.

28:52.905 --> 28:53.985
I do love her hair.

28:53.985 --> 28:55.345
Did you like the book?

28:55.345 --> 28:56.425
I did, actually.

28:56.425 --> 28:58.065
I tore through it.

28:58.065 --> 29:00.985
Then, according to my mother,
you shouldn't see the film.

29:00.985 --> 29:03.865
Elizabeth Taylor's the
only English thing in it.

29:03.865 --> 29:06.145
She said the Americans
just about destroyed it.

29:07.705 --> 29:11.225
She said it would've been better
if they'd just stolen the story

29:11.225 --> 29:15.665
and reset it in California or something.

29:17.025 --> 29:19.345
Well, I think we'll see for ourselves,
Harry.

29:19.345 --> 29:21.945
Your mother is hardly a noted critic.

29:25.065 --> 29:29.425
My mother, Feef,
is a very intelligent woman.

29:29.425 --> 29:31.825
Yes, Camilla raves about her.

29:51.865 --> 29:53.745
I don't think I can do this.

29:53.745 --> 29:56.665
So, what? Now you're out?

29:56.665 --> 29:58.225
I got news for you, Bug.

29:58.225 --> 29:59.345
If you work for the president

29:59.345 --> 30:01.625
you're not going to agree
with every decision he makes.

30:01.625 --> 30:03.425
This one is particularly egregious.

30:03.425 --> 30:05.785
War is... whatever that word was.

30:05.785 --> 30:07.705
Egregious.

30:07.705 --> 30:10.065
No-one can sign off on half
the shit their country does.

30:10.065 --> 30:13.505
You guys scooped up India and
Africa just cos you wanted them.

30:13.505 --> 30:15.745
We took out Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

30:15.745 --> 30:17.345
This is the world.

30:17.345 --> 30:18.705
It's fucking ugly.

30:18.705 --> 30:20.745
The question isn't,
"Are you proud of your country?"

30:20.745 --> 30:22.665
The question is,
"Are you proud of yourself?"

30:22.665 --> 30:25.505
"Are you doing everything you can
to make the world a better place?"

30:25.505 --> 30:27.585
I'd like to.

30:27.585 --> 30:30.785
Then do this job.

30:30.785 --> 30:32.585
Because you're intelligent...

30:32.585 --> 30:34.745
..and intelligence saves lives.

30:34.745 --> 30:37.785
The military rely on
Neanderthal tactics but what we do,

30:37.785 --> 30:41.345
what I do, and what I have
invited you to do

30:41.345 --> 30:44.065
is use your brain.

30:44.065 --> 30:45.545
And, do what you want,

30:45.545 --> 30:49.385
but opportunities like this
don't come along very often.

30:55.745 --> 30:57.785
Thank God I met you.

31:05.065 --> 31:07.545
I want my life to matter.

31:11.145 --> 31:13.545
Now that the war with Japan is over,

31:13.545 --> 31:16.305
whatever you're working
on is to be aborted.

31:16.305 --> 31:17.905
What the fuck?

31:17.905 --> 31:20.225
President Truman is of the
opinion that there is no need

31:20.225 --> 31:22.545
for field agents outside of Berlin.

31:22.545 --> 31:25.425
Uh, has anyone been reading my reports?

31:25.425 --> 31:29.145
What I'm working on is a
matter of international security.

31:29.145 --> 31:31.425
All reports have been read.

31:31.425 --> 31:34.705
And the president has determined
that a skeletal crew will remain

31:34.705 --> 31:39.985
in the UK but to receive
intelligence from MI6 only.

31:39.985 --> 31:43.145
As of eleven hundred hours next Tuesday,

31:43.145 --> 31:46.305
we will commence returning
you to the United States.

31:48.585 --> 31:50.705
Hey, I'm on your side.

31:50.705 --> 31:52.625
Meaning?

31:52.625 --> 31:54.065
This will not stand.

31:54.065 --> 31:57.585
Truman's saying this now but
the men with money disagree.

31:57.585 --> 32:01.425
Oh, since when do the men
with money share their thinking
with junior diplomats, Jimmy?

32:01.425 --> 32:06.425
Whose chief responsibility is
making sure the right swing band
is booked for the right BS event.

32:06.425 --> 32:09.345
Let me add a few details to my biography.

32:09.345 --> 32:10.785
Dalton Prep.

32:10.785 --> 32:12.145
Then Yale.

32:12.145 --> 32:15.905
My family is in shipping
and has been since 1759.

32:15.905 --> 32:19.065
Hm. And you're imparting
this to me because...?

32:21.345 --> 32:24.265
Disbanding is dangerous.

32:24.265 --> 32:25.905
Clearly you agree with me.

32:25.905 --> 32:27.905
You walked out of the meeting.

32:27.905 --> 32:29.225
Not using our own intelligence?

32:29.225 --> 32:30.905
Is he out of his mind?

32:30.905 --> 32:32.985
So, fuck that.

32:36.265 --> 32:38.585
Let's go talk somewhere more private.

32:59.265 --> 33:01.625
Let's drink to a job almost well done.

33:06.265 --> 33:08.185
We could still do it.

33:09.585 --> 33:11.905
They're keeping a skeletal crew.

33:11.905 --> 33:13.625
Ah.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.345
We sign up, we run our girl.

33:15.345 --> 33:16.585
I'm not doing that.

33:16.585 --> 33:21.385
That's insane. An order's been given.

33:21.385 --> 33:28.385
By who? A draper's son thrust on to
the podium by nothing but chance?

33:28.385 --> 33:32.505
Try as he might, the president
cannot relocate us to an imaginary

33:32.505 --> 33:36.905
universe where differences are
settled by handshakes and jousts.

33:36.905 --> 33:41.425
Let's let the Brits handle this.

33:41.425 --> 33:43.785
They can't! They're not capable.

33:43.785 --> 33:46.505
They're not capable of
winning their own wars.

33:46.505 --> 33:47.745
At the moment,

33:47.745 --> 33:50.225
they're not even capable of
putting food on the table.

33:52.145 --> 33:56.305
Come on, Peter! Whatever it takes!

33:56.305 --> 33:57.585
The war is over.

33:57.585 --> 33:59.385
No, that war is over.

33:59.385 --> 34:01.265
Now there's a new one.

34:01.265 --> 34:03.705
And it's our duty to fight it.

34:03.705 --> 34:06.425
We're fighting for the same
goals, the same dreams.

34:06.425 --> 34:10.344
It's another iteration of
the same fucking enemy!

34:10.344 --> 34:12.705
If we don't fight, we won't win.

34:12.705 --> 34:15.585
If we don't win, we won't survive.

34:15.585 --> 34:20.264
But if we do win, we could
tell the president all about it

34:20.264 --> 34:22.585
and we won't get our wrists slapped.

34:22.585 --> 34:24.344
I guarantee it.

34:24.344 --> 34:26.425
We'll get medals.

34:26.425 --> 34:31.625
I mean, what are you thinking?
Just you and her against the Russians?

34:31.625 --> 34:34.344
And Jimmy.

34:34.344 --> 34:36.905
Jimmy's a sleaze.

34:47.665 --> 34:53.425
I'm not going to tell anyone
about this conversation

34:53.425 --> 35:00.065
and I'm not gonna mention
that you suggested insurrection

35:00.065 --> 35:02.905
and that Jimmy should lose his job.

35:02.905 --> 35:08.785
What I am going to do is call
Feef and tell her that it's off.

35:10.745 --> 35:13.585
And then I'm going to get on a plane.

35:15.305 --> 35:18.065
Don't call her.

35:18.065 --> 35:20.145
She's in place.

35:20.145 --> 35:22.145
She's in Whitehall.

35:22.145 --> 35:24.185
Let me run her.

35:27.505 --> 35:29.065
No.

35:34.265 --> 35:38.065
OK. OK.

35:38.065 --> 35:40.385
It was worth a shot, right?

35:48.665 --> 35:51.025
Whatever it takes, right?

36:12.765 --> 36:14.525
You look nice.

36:14.525 --> 36:16.165
New dress?

36:16.165 --> 36:17.925
Um, they gave it to me.

37:57.845 --> 37:59.485
What are you doing here?

37:59.485 --> 38:01.805
What are you doing here?

38:01.805 --> 38:04.445
Well, it's a party to celebrate
the new government,

38:04.445 --> 38:05.845
so what are you doing here?

38:05.845 --> 38:07.725
Family friend invited me.

38:54.845 --> 38:57.645
If the purpose of these evening
was to prove you can carry off silver

38:57.645 --> 38:59.525
then mission accomplished.

38:59.525 --> 39:01.925
Oh, I'll take that as
an apology for dinner.

39:01.925 --> 39:03.765
It wasn't.

39:07.765 --> 39:10.245
Isn't he getting married this year?

39:10.245 --> 39:12.125
To a lovely girl.

39:12.125 --> 39:13.685
A Quaker.

39:13.685 --> 39:14.805
Nice.

39:20.405 --> 39:22.085
That's Feef.

39:29.965 --> 39:32.485
It was really nice to see you.
Excuse me.

39:39.765 --> 39:41.205
Thank you.

39:41.205 --> 39:42.685
No, thank you.

39:42.685 --> 39:45.485
And that's on behalf of the president.

39:45.485 --> 39:47.565
This is Jimmy Derby.

39:47.565 --> 39:50.885
We're going to be working together,
so may I have the pleasure?

39:52.925 --> 39:57.925
♪ Wildcat Kelley, lookin' mighty pale,

39:57.925 --> 40:02.125
♪ Was standin' By the sheriff's side

40:02.125 --> 40:05.965
♪ And when the sheriff

40:05.965 --> 40:08.885

Ooh! Drive.

40:55.685 --> 40:57.685
Where was Peter?

40:57.685 --> 40:59.085
He's working.

40:59.085 --> 41:00.845
You can catch up with him later.

41:14.205 --> 41:16.525
That politician you were
dancing with. A friend?

41:16.525 --> 41:18.045
Not really.

41:18.045 --> 41:20.965
Well, make him one.

41:20.965 --> 41:23.965
What else?
I'm in the civil service. Now what?

41:23.965 --> 41:27.045
Well, you're in the Ministry
of Housing, correct? Mm-hm.

41:27.045 --> 41:29.885
I need you to find a way to
move to the Cabinet Office.

41:29.885 --> 41:31.405
Why?

41:31.405 --> 41:33.405
You need to be where the power is.

41:33.405 --> 41:35.125
It's the heart of government.

41:35.125 --> 41:37.285
Don't you want to be at
the centre of it all?

41:37.285 --> 41:39.325
Drop me here.

41:54.085 --> 41:56.445
Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker!

41:56.445 --> 41:57.685
Mr Speaker!

41:57.685 --> 41:59.565
Mr Speaker!

42:03.965 --> 42:05.285
Order!

42:07.285 --> 42:10.005
We now have a maiden...

42:10.005 --> 42:11.885
..Mr Hugh Fenton.

42:13.205 --> 42:14.645
Come on, Hugh!

42:14.645 --> 42:16.485
Come on. Come on!

42:16.485 --> 42:21.165
Thank you, Mr Speaker, for giving me
my first opportunity to speak.

42:23.325 --> 42:27.005
I have the privilege and
the pleasure of representing

42:27.005 --> 42:30.365
some of the poorest
constituents in Derbyshire.

42:30.365 --> 42:34.565
In the village where I grew up,
we lost 68% of the men

42:34.565 --> 42:36.885
of fighting age to this war.

42:36.885 --> 42:40.805
And that means 32% of
them are coming home.

42:40.805 --> 42:45.125
32% of the fellows I went to
school with and climbed trees with

42:45.125 --> 42:49.645
and played Knock Down Ginger
with and played war with using sticks

42:49.645 --> 42:52.765
are coming home with a lot more
than scraped knees and black eyes.

42:54.685 --> 42:57.685
And I'm here in Parliament
to make sure my friends,

42:57.685 --> 43:02.125
my family, my community,
the working people of Britain

43:02.125 --> 43:04.805
are not betrayed by the men in power.

43:06.325 --> 43:08.205
Rubbish! Rubbish!

43:16.365 --> 43:22.485
Only 27 years ago the Last Great War,
the war to end all wars, ended.

43:22.485 --> 43:25.605
And Lloyd George promised that
we would build in peacetime

43:25.605 --> 43:28.325
a land fit for heroes.

43:28.325 --> 43:30.965
The heroes that came home.

43:30.965 --> 43:36.565
And what did Westminster do?
What did the Tory party do?

43:36.565 --> 43:41.445
They presided over economic deprivation!

43:41.445 --> 43:45.925
From their comfortable houses and back
rooms warmed by fires and whisky,

43:45.925 --> 43:51.165
hard-faced man slapped each other on the back
and talked about the Great British Empire,

43:51.165 --> 43:56.165
that encompassed India,
Africa, Australia, Canada...

43:56.165 --> 44:00.565
..and slums in Manchester,
Liverpool and London

44:00.565 --> 44:04.165
so squalid that, for those of us who
had the courage to walk through them

44:04.165 --> 44:08.445
and not look away,
they seemed like a very picture of hell.

44:14.925 --> 44:18.925
We of the Labour Party have our
eyes wide open and know full well

44:18.925 --> 44:23.085
that the disease and squalor and
poverty of education and employment

44:23.085 --> 44:26.685
that we face are not the result
of acts of God or blind forces

44:26.685 --> 44:30.285
but are the sure and certain
result of the concentration

44:30.285 --> 44:33.845
of too much economic power
in the hands of too few men!

44:41.045 --> 44:43.245
Order! Order!

44:45.525 --> 44:47.645
It was the common
man who fought the war.

44:47.645 --> 44:48.845
Yes!

44:48.845 --> 44:50.525
It was the common man that won the war.

44:50.525 --> 44:51.885
Yes!

44:51.885 --> 44:55.565
And it is the common man that now,
as this last election has shown,

44:55.565 --> 44:59.085
will define the terms of the peace.

44:59.085 --> 45:00.845
Health care for all. Yes!

45:00.845 --> 45:02.805
Housing for all. Yes!

45:02.805 --> 45:04.685
Culture for all. Yes!

45:06.685 --> 45:10.445
Someone said to me recently it makes
no difference who's in Number Ten.

45:12.125 --> 45:14.005
What a shock they have coming.

45:27.885 --> 45:30.485
We know the Russians
accessed information shared

45:30.485 --> 45:32.605
at two private Cabinet Office meetings.

45:32.605 --> 45:35.525
When the Russians embed someone
they keep him undercover for years,

45:35.525 --> 45:38.125
meaning their spy is still
posing as a civil servant.

45:38.125 --> 45:39.165
I get what you do.

45:39.165 --> 45:40.485
I get why you use that girl.

45:40.485 --> 45:42.965
If I get you money there have to be results.

45:42.965 --> 45:44.885
Please don't ask me anymore about Hugh.

45:44.885 --> 45:46.645
I have to be able to get up in the morning.

45:46.645 --> 45:49.205
Peter knows what this job
requires from a woman.

45:49.205 --> 45:51.165
Do what you have to do.

45:51.165 --> 45:54.365
Don't worry, I'll get you into a
lot of trouble. I want trouble.

45:54.365 --> 45:55.765
What's the matter with you?

45:55.765 --> 45:58.045
You British are deliberately causing conflict

45:58.045 --> 46:00.005
between the Jews and the Arabs to prolong

46:00.005 --> 46:02.085
your rule in the Middle East.
- That's right!

46:02.085 --> 46:03.685
I just wanted to ask you about

46:03.685 --> 46:05.325
Fiona Symonds, the new girl.

46:05.325 --> 46:06.605
She's not who she seems.

46:06.605 --> 46:08.565
I'm trying to keep you safe.

46:08.565 --> 46:09.845
I don't feel safe.

46:09.845 --> 46:11.605
Only idiots feel safe.

46:11.605 --> 46:14.445
It's nothing for you to
worry about, comrade.

46:14.445 --> 46:17.645
Hey! Where do you think you're gonna go!?
