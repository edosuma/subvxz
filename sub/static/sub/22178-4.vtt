set at the Edge of Realms,

took a girl prisoner.

37:49.532 --> 37:50.577
LUCY: Mom?

37:50.602 --> 37:52.602
Lucy!

37:53.453 --> 37:55.453
Where did you go?

37:55.836 --> 37:58.107
I just wanted to see the haunted house.

37:58.209 --> 38:02.111
Baby, I know, but you can't
keep running off like this.

38:03.448 --> 38:04.814
Thank you.

38:04.916 --> 38:06.255
No problem, but, uh, actually,

38:06.280 --> 38:08.443
it was Ivy who found her.

38:08.599 --> 38:10.119
What?

38:10.188 --> 38:11.670
And now I'm returning her to you.

38:11.695 --> 38:15.391
I've had enough of the
little ghoul for one night.

38:17.177 --> 38:19.130
There's an hour left
of trick-or-treating.

38:19.155 --> 38:20.430
You should go.

38:20.498 --> 38:22.231
All three of you.

38:22.378 --> 38:24.678
But what about grandma?

38:24.703 --> 38:26.936
I will handle her.

38:27.038 --> 38:28.237
Ivy, thank you.

38:28.340 --> 38:30.506
Yeah, I am not doing this for you.

38:30.608 --> 38:33.009
Okay. I'll see you around.

38:37.749 --> 38:39.382
So, what do you say?

38:39.451 --> 38:41.818
Too much candy? A
crazy night on the town?

38:41.920 --> 38:44.620
Yeah, and you should
help Mom paint my face.

38:44.723 --> 38:46.889
Come on. It's a family tradition.

38:50.067 --> 38:51.053
You know what? That's your thing.

38:51.078 --> 38:52.680
I don't want to get in the way of that.

38:52.888 --> 38:54.888
No, you'll fit right in.

38:55.963 --> 38:59.264
Hey, what were you gonna ask me earlier?

39:00.638 --> 39:05.074
Oh, um, just, uh, if
you would take a look

39:05.176 --> 39:06.554
at my blog post about the garden,

39:06.579 --> 39:09.278
you know, once it's finished.

39:09.381 --> 39:10.380
Oh.

39:11.382 --> 39:13.149
Sure. No problem.

39:13.251 --> 39:15.234
I got the makeup ready, Mom!

39:17.956 --> 39:20.123
Happy Halloween, Henry.

39:21.294 --> 39:23.333
Happy Halloween to you, too.

39:28.566 --> 39:30.333
[SIREN WAILS IN DISTANCE]

39:32.670 --> 39:34.370
[DOOR CLOSES]

39:34.472 --> 39:37.106
I hear you had the troubled
girl in your custody

39:37.208 --> 39:40.676
and you let her go.

39:40.779 --> 39:44.380
Well, you'll be happy to hear
that Tilly is back on her pills.

39:45.032 --> 39:47.150
Didn't seem such a
public menace anymore,

39:47.252 --> 39:50.052
so, yeah, I let her go.

39:50.556 --> 39:52.922
You seem to be forgetting
about those tapes.

39:53.024 --> 39:57.560
Oh, no, I remember. Quite clearly.

39:57.585 --> 39:59.460
But...

39:59.485 --> 40:02.486
it appears that I've found something

40:02.675 --> 40:09.046
much bigger than what's
on those tapes... dearie.

40:09.274 --> 40:11.374
And what might that be?

40:14.544 --> 40:18.479
Trust me... something you
don't want anyone to find out.

40:18.504 --> 40:19.832
And if I were you, I would choose

40:19.857 --> 40:23.085
my next step wisely, Victoria.

40:23.683 --> 40:25.288
Because, try as you may,

40:25.356 --> 40:29.192
there's nothing you can
do to hurt me anymore.

40:37.287 --> 40:40.288
[MID-TEMPO ROCK MUSIC PLAYS ON STEREO]

40:41.906 --> 40:42.805
Trick or Treat?

40:42.907 --> 40:43.986
What's this?

40:44.011 --> 40:44.852
Something better

40:44.877 --> 40:46.642
than the cheap antifreeze
you're drinking.

40:46.744 --> 40:53.516
It's a gift for helping me
put... me first for once.

40:53.618 --> 40:55.618
And for listening to
my side of the story.

40:55.720 --> 40:57.520
No one ever does that.

40:57.589 --> 40:59.889
I know it's not gonna be easy
to stand up to your mother.

40:59.991 --> 41:01.791
[CHUCKLES DRYLY] Yep.

41:01.816 --> 41:05.284
Now, you are going to drink with
me until I'm ready to face her.

41:05.463 --> 41:08.364
So, what happened to Lucy and Jacinda?

41:08.466 --> 41:11.289
Thought you'd be out
getting adult onset diabetes.

41:11.852 --> 41:14.214
I guess that you're braver than I am.

41:14.239 --> 41:17.373
Couldn't take a chance and do
the scary thing after all, huh?

41:18.977 --> 41:20.829
It's complicated.

41:20.854 --> 41:22.120
Hm.

41:22.447 --> 41:25.882
Well, to keeping things uncomplicated.
