YOU CAN DO IT!

01:49.961 --> 01:51.293

03:33.014 --> 03:34.747
- YOU DO THAT EVERY DAY?

03:34.749 --> 03:37.816
- NO. MOST DAYS, I FIGHT MORE
THAN JUST TWO OF THEM.

03:53.264 --> 03:56.031
- THEY WEREN'T GUYS AT ALL.

04:01.972 --> 04:04.839
THE LOCRIX ARE VICIOUS
FIGHTING MACHINES.

04:04.841 --> 04:07.107
- MACHINES?
WHAT DO THEY WANT?

04:07.109 --> 04:09.909
- NOTHING LESS THAN TOTAL
GALACTIC DOMINATION.

04:09.911 --> 04:12.912
THE LOCRIX THINK THEY'RE
SUPERIOR TO ORGANICS,

04:12.914 --> 04:15.247
AND THEY ARE DETERMINED
TO WIPE US OUT.

04:20.387 --> 04:22.987
- BUT YOU HAVE
DEFEATED THEM, YES?

04:22.989 --> 04:26.256
- THOSE TWO WERE JUST SCOUTS.
THERE ARE MANY MORE
WHERE THEY CAME FROM.

- I'VE BEEN BATTLING THE CRIXIES
ABOUT AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER.

04:32.330 --> 04:34.496
THEY TRIED TO TAKE OVER
VERNATHIA,

04:34.498 --> 04:37.332
BUT I WASN'T ABOUT
TO LET THAT HAPPEN.

04:37.334 --> 04:40.201

FROM TRYING TO TAKE OVER EARTH?

WHERE THEY LIVE--

04:42.705 --> 04:45.038
SENTIEN, THE MOTHER PLANET--

04:45.040 --> 04:47.707
AND I'M TAKING A CLASS-5
QUANTUM ERADICATOR.

04:47.709 --> 04:50.176
ONCE I PLUG IT INTO
THEIR CENTRAL POWER CORE,

04:50.178 --> 04:52.378
IT'LL SHUT 'EM DOWN FOREVER.

04:52.380 --> 04:53.779
- WE'D LIKE TO HELP.

04:53.781 --> 04:55.447

IT'S GOING TO BE DANGEROUS.

04:57.717 --> 05:01.452
THOSE CRIXIES ARE TOUGH.
THEY WON'T GIVE UP
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

05:01.454 --> 05:02.653
- NEITHER WILL WE.

05:11.329 --> 05:14.263
- IT WAS ME VERSUS 20 OF THEM.
THEY HAD ME SURROUNDED.

05:14.265 --> 05:17.099
THERE WERE CRIXIES TO THE LEFT
OF ME, CRIXIES TO THE RIGHT.

FOR VAL YOR.

05:19.470 --> 05:21.436

05:21.438 --> 05:23.771
- WELL, I CERTAINLY WASN'T
GOING TO LET THEM GET ME,

05:23.773 --> 05:27.274
SO I LED THEM TO A TRAP,
SHORT-CIRCUITED THE LOT OF THEM,

05:27.276 --> 05:29.376
AND ESCAPED WITHOUT A SCRATCH.

05:29.378 --> 05:32.512
- DUDE! THOSE CRIXIES
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS COMIN'!

HEH! REMIND ME TO STAY
ON YOUR GOOD SIDE.

NEXT TIME.

- OK, TEAM, BACK TO THE BRIDGE.

09:25.948 --> 09:28.848
WE NEED TO BE READY IN CASE
THEY'RE FOOLISH ENOUGH
TO LAUNCH ANOTHER ATTACK.

TO ENDANGER YOUR SHIP.

09:34.821 --> 09:37.588

THIS IS A JOB
FOR YOU, TROQQIE.

11:34.583 --> 11:36.616

AND MOVE THOSE MINES.

11:36.618 --> 11:37.950

- VAL YOR, YOU ARE SUCH
A BRAVE WARRIOR.

11:42.389 --> 11:45.957
ARE YOU SURE YOU DO NOT WISH
TO MOVE THESE DEVICES YOURSELF?

11:45.959 --> 11:49.060
- OF COURSE I COULD MOVE THEM,
BUT I'M NEEDED INSIDE.

CAN NAVIGATE THROUGH HERE.

PUNCH HIM OUT,
