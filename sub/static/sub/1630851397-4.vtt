01:15.125 --> 01:16.458
<i>I'm the class teacher, so…</i>

01:16.541 --> 01:18.125
MONDAY, 19 OCTOBER

01:18.208 --> 01:20.541
Yes, I get that. It's just…

01:20.625 --> 01:25.291
Le is staying with her grandpa,
so if it has to be today, he'll attend.

01:25.375 --> 01:28.166
<i>I've invited the school psychologist too.</i>

01:28.250 --> 01:32.750
The school psychologist? Why?
Wasn't this just some friendship trouble?

01:32.833 --> 01:35.041
<i>That's what we're trying to ascertain.</i>

01:35.125 --> 01:37.625
<i>So the whole group of girls is coming.</i>

01:37.708 --> 01:40.833
-Okay.
<i>-It would be best if you could attend too.</i>

01:40.916 --> 01:44.916
-Yes, of course. I'd really like that.
<i>-Great. See you then.</i>

02:12.625 --> 02:14.250
Are you here to see the apartment?

02:14.333 --> 02:16.458
I saw it the other day.
It's newly decorated.

02:16.541 --> 02:18.791
You're barking up the wrong tree.

02:18.875 --> 02:20.750
Do you know if Hess is at home?

02:21.416 --> 02:24.916
No idea. But go on in.
He never locks the door.

02:28.791 --> 02:31.250
He says
he's got nothing worth stealing, but…

02:35.000 --> 02:36.083
What the hell's this?

02:40.041 --> 02:40.875
What's up?

02:42.083 --> 02:43.375
You just painted it all.

02:44.458 --> 02:47.166
But you said
it needed two coats anyway, right?

02:49.416 --> 02:51.416
Dad, we're playing Monopoly.

02:52.166 --> 02:53.208
Come on, kiddo.

02:59.375 --> 03:00.291
What's up?

03:00.375 --> 03:03.041
You don't answer your phone
or come to the briefings.

03:04.041 --> 03:05.666
No. What did they say?

03:05.750 --> 03:08.291
Forensic analysis didn't show anything.

03:08.375 --> 03:13.416
IT still can't track the IP address
from the anonymous reports.

03:13.500 --> 03:16.875
And IT can't see
who sent the text with the sex video.

03:16.958 --> 03:19.041
-Any traces at the cottage?
-Nothing.

03:19.125 --> 03:21.166
The murderer must have spotted us.

03:21.250 --> 03:24.166
And he knew Kvium sometimes
borrowed that cottage.

03:24.916 --> 03:27.708
So, our only clue
from the chestnut man we found

03:27.791 --> 03:29.875
is the print from Rosa Hartung's daughter.

03:30.958 --> 03:33.083
Yes, so we'll need to talk to her.

03:34.791 --> 03:36.208
-To Rosa Hartung?
-Yes.

03:36.875 --> 03:39.666
Everything revolves around her.
It always has.

03:39.750 --> 03:41.666
They won't let us question Hartung.

03:41.750 --> 03:46.000
Take a look at this. This one.
The video I just discovered. Take a look.

03:46.083 --> 03:48.958
Not now.
Nylander wants to talk about Ricks.

03:49.041 --> 03:52.166
The police video from where
Kristine disappeared a year ago.

03:52.250 --> 03:53.083
Look.

03:54.500 --> 03:55.791
Next to her school bag.

03:58.666 --> 03:59.541
A chestnut man.

04:12.291 --> 04:15.166
We have to apply pressure
to Nylander again.

04:55.708 --> 04:59.416
THE CHESTNUT MAN

05:04.458 --> 05:06.125
<i>Ricks had 22 years of experience</i>

05:06.750 --> 05:09.250
and was as much a part of the station

05:10.166 --> 05:13.125
as the foundation
upon which this place was built.

05:14.625 --> 05:19.208
<i>We're all affected by the loss of Martin</i>
<i>and by the entire case.</i>

05:22.416 --> 05:26.166
<i>But we owe it to him,</i>
<i>the victims</i>,<i> and their families</i>

05:26.250 --> 05:30.083
<i>to find and stop</i>
<i>the murderer or murderers.</i>

05:31.666 --> 05:33.708
<i>Please join me in a moment of silence</i>

05:35.083 --> 05:37.708
<i>to honor our colleague</i>

05:38.625 --> 05:39.458
<i>and friend…</i>

05:40.958 --> 05:41.833
Martin Ricks.

05:49.666 --> 05:51.875
Four victims, including one of our own.

05:51.958 --> 05:54.625
As I understand it,
the minister may be next.

05:55.250 --> 05:57.875
The police assigned her bodyguards.
All precautions--

05:57.958 --> 06:01.458
And her husband's TV appearance…
The media's eating us alive.

06:01.541 --> 06:04.458
The minister of justice
is on my back over those prints.

06:04.541 --> 06:08.083
-Theoretically, prints can last forever.
-You can't be serious.

06:08.166 --> 06:09.458
Hey! Let go.

06:09.541 --> 06:12.916
-Hey, stop! Jansen!
-What's going on?

06:13.000 --> 06:15.541
-Jansen, stop that.
-This is your fault.

06:15.625 --> 06:18.541
Ricks died
because of your fucking great ideas.

06:18.625 --> 06:19.958
Stop that! All right!

06:20.541 --> 06:22.291
I gave the go-ahead.

06:22.375 --> 06:25.208
If you want to blame someone,
blame me. Relax.

06:33.041 --> 06:34.500
Go home, and take a break.

06:37.875 --> 06:38.833
Okay.

06:40.166 --> 06:42.250
-Nylander.
-Yeah. Hold up.

06:42.333 --> 06:45.583
Don't just stand there. Come on.
We've a case to crack.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.625
I know what the two of you want.

06:49.750 --> 06:51.375
You may question Rosa Hartung.

06:52.416 --> 06:54.750
I spoke to the ministry.
They're expecting you.

06:55.833 --> 06:58.750
Please be aware
that she's received some threats.

06:59.583 --> 07:02.041
I'm sorry, but it was need-to-know.

07:02.583 --> 07:04.791
Bring the reports
from intelligence services.

07:13.416 --> 07:15.916
<i>Steen's story is all over social media.</i>

07:16.000 --> 07:18.041
I just had a call from the PM's advisor.

07:18.708 --> 07:21.125
They recommend a press release

07:21.208 --> 07:24.916
where you express your confidence
that the police will solve the case.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.125
But Steen's right.

07:26.791 --> 07:28.875
There is uncertainty about that case now.

07:29.750 --> 07:32.375
We need to shut down all media speculation

07:32.458 --> 07:35.833
to avoid increased pressure on
the government and the justice ministry.

07:35.916 --> 07:37.458
The police are here.

07:39.958 --> 07:42.125
You want to get back
to negotiations, right?

07:43.958 --> 07:45.583
I can't decide that right now.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.166
Let me speak to the police first.

07:50.583 --> 07:52.416
<i>Here are the three women:</i>

07:54.458 --> 07:58.458
Laura Kjær,
Anne Sejer-Lassen, and Jessie Kvium.

07:58.541 --> 08:03.791
I recognize them from the media,
but I've never met them.

08:03.875 --> 08:07.666
All three were reported anonymously
by the murderer to local authorities

08:07.750 --> 08:10.750
for either neglecting
or abusing their children.

08:10.833 --> 08:15.916
Despite the reports,
the abuse went undetected by authorities.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.458
You're the social minister,
and with Kristine's prints,

08:18.541 --> 08:23.458
we believe that the murderer
is primarily targeting you.

08:23.541 --> 08:26.083
-Does he think it's my fault?
-Perhaps.

08:26.166 --> 08:31.625
And it may be the same man
behind the threats you've received lately.

08:33.208 --> 08:36.875
Do you know who might call you a murderer?

08:37.541 --> 08:40.916
The police asked that before,
but I have no idea.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.291
Think carefully, please.

08:43.875 --> 08:49.000
Was there a conflict or problem
where someone might want revenge?

08:49.083 --> 08:52.583
No, I have no idea.
I have no personal enemies,

08:52.666 --> 08:55.666
but I have recommended
that more children are removed

08:55.750 --> 08:56.833
in abuse cases.

08:56.916 --> 08:59.500
So yes,
perhaps some parents feel betrayed.

08:59.583 --> 09:02.875
Can you think of any specific cases?

09:04.916 --> 09:08.416
No. I'm not the type to think like that.

09:08.500 --> 09:10.875
The children always come first.

09:10.958 --> 09:13.958
As you know,
I was in care myself for a while.

09:14.041 --> 09:16.291
-I know what I'm talking about.
-Tell us more.

09:18.916 --> 09:21.875
I'm adopted. An only child.

09:21.958 --> 09:23.833
I don't know my birth parents.

09:23.916 --> 09:27.208
Both my foster parents passed away,
but I had a lovely childhood.

09:29.583 --> 09:33.166
The chestnut men
have got to mean something.

09:33.916 --> 09:37.166
Can you think of a reason
why someone's confronting you with them?

09:37.250 --> 09:40.958
Only what you already know.
Kristine used to make those men--

09:41.041 --> 09:43.833
It's got nothing to do with that.
It must be something else.

09:43.916 --> 09:48.000
It's… It's a strange calling card.

09:48.083 --> 09:51.000
It feels like someone knows you
and wants to tell you something.

09:52.291 --> 09:53.583
Think again.

09:53.666 --> 09:55.375
Maybe earlier on in your life…

09:56.875 --> 09:58.291
When you were younger, or…

10:00.500 --> 10:02.833
How about
when Kristine disappeared a year ago?

10:05.583 --> 10:06.416
No.

10:08.666 --> 10:10.166
I don't know what it could be.

10:17.125 --> 10:18.041
Thank you.

10:18.125 --> 10:20.958
-Does that mean you're stuck?
-No, we'll be back.

10:21.041 --> 10:25.541
But we'd like to see the removal cases
from your time in the ministry.

10:26.125 --> 10:26.958
Of course.

10:28.333 --> 10:30.291
I have a few questions for you too.

10:32.291 --> 10:34.708
Is there any chance that she's alive?

10:35.500 --> 10:36.333
Kristine?

10:37.041 --> 10:38.375
No, I'm sorry.

10:39.166 --> 10:40.708
But we do understand

10:40.791 --> 10:43.750
why your husband did the interview
saying the things he did.

10:45.750 --> 10:46.875
But the prints…

10:46.958 --> 10:50.250
Three times does seem like--

10:50.333 --> 10:51.958
If the murderer wants to hurt you,

10:52.041 --> 10:55.958
the ultimate torture is to cause you both
to get your hopes up.

10:57.875 --> 10:59.333
But you're not 100% certain?

11:00.750 --> 11:02.083
There might be a chance?

11:08.500 --> 11:10.000
Call if you think of anything.

11:11.333 --> 11:12.166
Thank you.

11:20.625 --> 11:23.750
These are the latest removal cases
we printed out.

11:23.833 --> 11:25.625
They'll send more from the ministry.

11:25.708 --> 11:28.833
Look for cases of extreme anger
against the system or the minister.

11:28.916 --> 11:30.125
-Okay.
-Great.

11:30.208 --> 11:33.041
These cases are our best chance.

11:33.125 --> 11:36.625
I have to go to a meeting at school,
but I'll be back in an hour.

11:41.625 --> 11:46.625
The chestnut man in the video must mean
that Kristine's attacker is the same guy.

11:46.708 --> 11:47.791
It…

11:47.875 --> 11:50.291
Rosa has got to be the connection.

11:50.375 --> 11:54.250
Yes, but we can't prove
the murders are connected to Kristine.

12:09.375 --> 12:11.041
Could I see the video again?

12:11.125 --> 12:12.958
-Sure.
-What's the timecode?

12:13.625 --> 12:14.750
01:28.

12:18.625 --> 12:19.875
It looks like the others.

12:20.875 --> 12:24.583
She may have made that
and it fell out of her bag?

12:49.958 --> 12:50.916
Come over here.

12:57.125 --> 12:58.416
Do you see what I see?

13:02.500 --> 13:03.833
Again. Play. Rewind.

13:05.291 --> 13:07.375
Genz, have you got a moment?

13:07.458 --> 13:10.000
No, Nylander is on my back 24/7.

13:10.083 --> 13:14.000
Play this and watch the very end.
Timecode 02:48.

13:16.458 --> 13:18.750
Great. Everybody, take a short break.

13:19.625 --> 13:22.291
If you fast-forward to the timecode…

13:22.375 --> 13:23.208
Yes.

13:24.333 --> 13:26.000
-02:48.
-Yes.

13:34.833 --> 13:35.708
What?

13:35.791 --> 13:37.583
-Isn't that Linus Bekker?
-Exactly.

13:38.333 --> 13:40.958
Do you know when the video was recorded?

13:42.000 --> 13:44.041
-Do you have it on file?
-Yes.

13:44.125 --> 13:48.541
According to the report, Linus Bekker's
residence was searched after a tip-off.

13:49.625 --> 13:53.208
The call was made from a cell phone
with an unregistered SIM card.

13:53.291 --> 13:55.208
-Yes.
-Did you find out anything else?

13:55.916 --> 14:01.208
No. We were busy with the machete
and Bekker's perverse proclivities.

14:01.291 --> 14:04.541
He hacked police files
to see pictures of dead bodies.

14:05.833 --> 14:09.166
But he didn't confess until
Jansen confronted him with the machete.

14:10.833 --> 14:12.666
Yes, I think so.

14:12.750 --> 14:14.041
At 6:07 p.m.,

14:15.666 --> 14:16.791
Bekker is right there.

14:16.875 --> 14:17.875
At 6:07 p.m.

14:24.750 --> 14:25.625
What does it say?

14:27.125 --> 14:28.458
That's at the same time.

14:29.166 --> 14:33.541
The same time Bekker said he was
driving around with the body up north.

14:34.833 --> 14:37.541
I don't want to ruin your theory,

14:37.625 --> 14:41.500
but Bekker still could have killed her
either before or after this.

14:41.583 --> 14:44.500
Why confess to a murder he didn't commit?

14:47.041 --> 14:48.208
Let's ask him that.

14:50.041 --> 14:52.166
-Yes.
-Do you think Nylander will let you?

14:58.500 --> 15:01.708
Liv is finding all of the removal cases
and meeting me at home

15:01.791 --> 15:06.291
after the women's refuge meeting
so that we can review them together.

15:07.166 --> 15:10.291
But you have a negotiations meeting
at the ministry of finance.

15:11.583 --> 15:13.083
Yes, I canceled it.

15:14.458 --> 15:18.166
I read your draft press release.
We're not putting it out.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.208
I agree with Steen.

15:20.375 --> 15:24.500
I like Steen too,
but to an outsider, he is acting crazy.

15:25.375 --> 15:29.125
If you support him,
speaking as both counsel and friend,

15:29.208 --> 15:31.500
you're running the risk
of the PM firing you.

15:31.583 --> 15:33.708
Nothing is more important
than my daughter.

15:37.250 --> 15:38.083
Thank you.

15:40.458 --> 15:42.791
-Look after her.
-Yes, of course.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.083
Wait a sec. I forgot my laptop,
but Liv is bringing it.

15:48.166 --> 15:49.500
-That's okay.
-Thank you.

16:06.708 --> 16:08.708
Well, I think we'd better…

16:10.458 --> 16:13.625
Dad is also waiting, so let's go.

16:13.708 --> 16:17.083
Is that okay with you, sweetie?
We had a lovely day, thanks.

16:18.291 --> 16:19.416
Bye, Tobias.

16:20.375 --> 16:21.208
See you later.

16:30.875 --> 16:34.166
<i>There's too much happening with the police</i>
<i>and bodyguards. Let's wait.</i>

16:35.083 --> 16:36.041
She didn't wait.

16:36.708 --> 16:39.375
She didn't give us a chance.
Why should we give her one?

16:40.666 --> 16:42.208
<i>Just do what we agreed.</i>

16:52.958 --> 16:54.666
How about this one from last year?

16:56.208 --> 16:57.041
Scroll down.

16:59.375 --> 17:02.041
No, that's not… How about that one?

17:04.416 --> 17:06.458
-Are the reporters still outside?
-No.

17:06.541 --> 17:09.541
But they were at the school, I'm afraid.

17:09.625 --> 17:12.083
It's your fucking fault.
You started it all again.

17:14.916 --> 17:17.250
I already explained why we're doing it.

17:17.333 --> 17:19.416
But he's finding it hard to believe.

17:20.166 --> 17:23.083
I'll be in the office.
My phone is ringing constantly.

17:23.166 --> 17:26.625
I've had 100 emails from people
who watched the interview.

17:26.708 --> 17:27.625
What are you doing?

17:27.708 --> 17:29.750
The police asked for
the removal case files

17:29.833 --> 17:32.791
from my time in office,
so we're just reviewing them.

17:32.875 --> 17:37.958
Rosa, do you remember
that awful case about… Was she a doctor?

17:38.041 --> 17:41.125
She had a child removed
and went to the media.

17:41.833 --> 17:42.916
She was a nurse.

17:44.375 --> 17:47.166
Her allegations against the authorities
were serious.

17:48.166 --> 17:51.625
Yeah, I'm trying to find the file.
I just don't remember her name.

17:51.708 --> 17:54.791
It was after your trip to Brussels.

17:57.125 --> 17:59.000
Could you go back two years, please?

17:59.583 --> 18:01.958
It was winter. Maybe January or February.

18:07.500 --> 18:08.833
Stop. Look at that one.

18:13.916 --> 18:16.125
Jansen, why don't you go home?

18:20.791 --> 18:22.708
Have you seen Hess or Thulin?

18:23.916 --> 18:24.875
No. What's up?

18:25.500 --> 18:28.208
It's Rosa Hartung's PA.

18:28.291 --> 18:30.458
They've remembered a specific case.

18:30.958 --> 18:31.916
Let me talk to her.

18:34.375 --> 18:35.208
Thank you.

18:36.791 --> 18:38.166
Detective Tim Jansen.

18:39.166 --> 18:41.333
I don't know where they are.
Maybe I can help?

19:07.291 --> 19:09.750
Tell her I'm sorry I can't be there.

19:09.833 --> 19:13.125
<i>They asked for a parent-teacher meeting.</i>
<i>I'm a grandparent!</i>

19:13.208 --> 19:15.541
<i>-</i>Yes.
-<i>Le wants to speak to you.</i>

19:15.625 --> 19:18.750
-Hi, baby.
-<i>Mom, I need you here.</i>

19:18.833 --> 19:21.291
I'm so sorry, but I can't.

19:21.375 --> 19:26.541
Grandpa is there with you,
and you two can work it out, right?

19:26.625 --> 19:27.916
<i>I miss you, Mom.</i>

19:28.916 --> 19:30.125
-Honey--
<i>-It's me.</i>

19:31.541 --> 19:32.708
<i>The meeting's starting.</i>

19:34.291 --> 19:35.666
Thulin, we're up!

19:38.250 --> 19:41.125
-Hello, I'm doctor Weiland.
-Hess.

19:42.500 --> 19:43.333
Hi.

19:43.833 --> 19:46.125
-If you'd follow me, please.
-Thank you.

19:47.291 --> 19:49.958
The patients naturally
have no access to news

19:50.041 --> 19:51.875
or information on murder cases.

19:51.958 --> 19:56.791
If you want to talk to Linus Bekker,
you can only discuss his case.

19:56.875 --> 19:58.125
Do you understand?

20:07.583 --> 20:09.625
I don't know where her body is.

20:10.166 --> 20:13.500
-I only remember what I already said.
-That's not why we're here.

20:16.000 --> 20:21.458
We'd like to hear a bit more
about the photo files you hacked.

20:23.291 --> 20:26.208
The police files of dead bodies
from crime scenes.

20:28.416 --> 20:29.791
Can you tell us a bit more?

20:34.750 --> 20:36.458
I knew it was illegal.

20:39.333 --> 20:42.250
But in the beginning,
I believed they were helping me.

20:43.750 --> 20:44.583
The photos.

20:46.291 --> 20:48.833
But it only made me think of one thing.

20:48.916 --> 20:51.375
What do you remember
from the day with Kristine?

20:53.291 --> 20:54.791
I remember that…

20:55.791 --> 20:57.666
I needed fresh air.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.250
-So I went for a drive.
-On the day of the murder?

21:04.666 --> 21:05.916
What happened next?

21:09.791 --> 21:14.208
Only flashbacks.
My medication made me black out.

21:15.208 --> 21:18.583
But do you remember
following Kristine Hartung?

21:20.500 --> 21:21.541
Not really.

21:21.625 --> 21:24.750
But I remember the place and her bicycle.

21:25.666 --> 21:27.958
But if you don't remember her,

21:28.041 --> 21:31.208
then how do we know
that you attacked and killed her?

21:32.166 --> 21:33.291
That's what they said.

21:35.333 --> 21:37.500
They helped me remember other stuff too.

21:37.583 --> 21:40.166
Who did? The police?

21:44.333 --> 21:49.750
They found dirt on my shoes
and blood on the machete I used.

21:49.833 --> 21:52.541
That's evidence.
We're not interested in that.

21:52.625 --> 21:54.083
We interested in whether you…

21:55.250 --> 21:59.208
In the beginning,
you said you didn't do it.

21:59.291 --> 22:00.750
Do you remember?

22:01.750 --> 22:03.083
What made you say that?

22:05.791 --> 22:06.625
It…

22:08.041 --> 22:10.541
The doctors said
that's how my disease works.

22:11.291 --> 22:13.500
I alter reality and facts.

22:14.125 --> 22:14.958
Linus.

22:16.750 --> 22:19.791
Were you particularly close
to anyone during that time?

22:21.458 --> 22:23.625
Someone you'd met by coincidence?

22:23.708 --> 22:26.291
Someone you trusted?
Perhaps someone online?

22:26.375 --> 22:28.791
I don't think I understand what you want.

22:30.041 --> 22:32.500
I'd like to go back to my room.

22:32.583 --> 22:34.875
-Easy now.
-Don't get nervous, Linus.

22:34.958 --> 22:36.625
-Don't be nervous.
-Sit down.

22:38.500 --> 22:39.666
We're almost done.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.250
If you help us…

22:49.208 --> 22:50.625
If you could think back…

22:53.500 --> 22:56.750
we'll figure out
what happened to Kristine Hartung.

23:01.166 --> 23:02.916
-You think so?
-Yeah, we do.

23:03.416 --> 23:07.291
You said you took a drive up north
with Kristine's body.

23:07.958 --> 23:11.416
But that's not correct.
You're standing right there.

23:11.500 --> 23:14.750
Look. That's you right there.

23:15.791 --> 23:17.250
At the time she disappeared.

23:18.541 --> 23:21.083
I think you heard
about Kristine in the news

23:21.166 --> 23:24.916
and went to the scene
because you're into that stuff. Right?

23:26.375 --> 23:27.208
Linus?

23:43.166 --> 23:45.500
Why don't you ask
what you really want to know?

23:48.958 --> 23:50.041
What do you mean?

23:52.875 --> 23:55.416
Why did I confess to a crime
I didn't commit?

23:56.666 --> 23:59.958
-Why did you confess?
-Come on…

24:00.041 --> 24:02.375
-Why did you confess?
-Don't you get it?

24:02.458 --> 24:04.958
What don't you get?
I know why you're here.

24:07.625 --> 24:08.625
Why are we here?

24:17.250 --> 24:18.916
<i>Chestnut man</i>

24:20.125 --> 24:21.208
<i>Come on inside</i>

24:21.291 --> 24:24.166
How do you know about that?

24:24.250 --> 24:26.166
Just like you, I didn't know a thing.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.583
Then you found
the bloody machete in my garage.

24:31.208 --> 24:33.125
And I saw I was part of his plan.

24:33.750 --> 24:37.208
-I'm a chosen one.
-Who chose you then?

24:39.958 --> 24:42.166
Where does he put the chestnuts?

24:43.041 --> 24:46.500
Does he make chestnut men?
Do any of them have little wings?

24:46.583 --> 24:48.708
-Where's Kristine?
-It doesn't matter.

24:48.791 --> 24:50.833
-What did he do to her?
-It doesn't matter.

24:50.916 --> 24:52.000
Where is she?

24:52.083 --> 24:54.958
She's had a great time with him.
I promise you that.

24:57.583 --> 24:58.416
Where is she?

24:58.500 --> 25:01.750
-Hess!
-Tell me where she is!

25:02.625 --> 25:04.125
Tell me where she is.

25:04.958 --> 25:07.833
He attacked me.
The police officer attacked me.

25:18.375 --> 25:19.208
Sorry.

25:21.541 --> 25:23.375
I went too far.

25:26.333 --> 25:29.208
Nylander called repeatedly.
Something must have happened.

25:29.291 --> 25:32.458
How the hell does Bekker know
who the murderer is?

25:32.541 --> 25:38.125
Bekker hacked into the police files
with the crime scene photos, right?

25:38.208 --> 25:39.041
Yes.

25:39.125 --> 25:43.250
What if he saw something in the files he
recognized from the Kristine Hartung case?

25:46.208 --> 25:47.833
I'll call Genz right away.

25:49.750 --> 25:51.166
<i>Hi. What did Bekker say?</i>

25:51.250 --> 25:55.750
I'll tell you later. We need
the photos Bekker found in the files

25:55.833 --> 25:59.333
and a list of the crimes
he was particularly interested in.

25:59.416 --> 26:02.000
<i>You'll have to call IT yourself.</i>

26:02.083 --> 26:04.875
<i>I'm on my way to a scene</i>
<i>that Jansen just reported.</i>

26:04.958 --> 26:06.041
-Jansen?
<i>-Yes.</i>

26:06.125 --> 26:07.333
<i>-Didn't he call you?</i>
-No.

26:07.416 --> 26:10.166
<i>We had a tip-off from Rosa Hartung's PA.</i>

26:10.875 --> 26:12.708
<i>They think they found the murderers.</i>

26:26.750 --> 26:29.250
-Where's Jansen?
-In the building at the entrance.

26:30.708 --> 26:31.541
Thanks.

26:33.916 --> 26:36.458
We had a tip-off from Rosa Hartung's PA.

26:36.541 --> 26:40.125
About a woman
who had her child removed due to neglect.

26:41.833 --> 26:45.458
It's an old foundry,
and the caretaker lived here.

26:45.541 --> 26:47.791
The tenant is Benedikte Skans.

26:47.875 --> 26:49.375
28-year-old nurse.

26:50.708 --> 26:54.333
She had postnatal psychosis and the child
was removed by the authorities.

26:55.333 --> 26:57.541
Soon after,
the child died from a lung infection.

26:57.625 --> 27:00.750
She was sent to a mental ward,
released this spring,

27:00.833 --> 27:03.666
and reinstated in her job as a nurse.

27:03.750 --> 27:05.458
She lived here with her boyfriend.

27:09.250 --> 27:12.625
As you can see, they've not forgotten
what happened at all.

27:29.083 --> 27:30.916
I think they did this together.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.833
FINALLY, IT'S YOUR TURN,
YOU DISGUSTING WHORE

27:32.916 --> 27:35.750
-Where are they now?
-Skans left the hospital around 2:00 p.m.

27:35.833 --> 27:37.458
Nobody's seen her since then.

27:37.541 --> 27:39.250
-Which ward?
-Pediatrics.

27:39.333 --> 27:42.125
-Who's the boyfriend?
-We'll find out.

27:42.208 --> 27:45.333
They're not married,
so the case is all in her name.

27:46.291 --> 27:47.958
Jansen, do we think it's them?

27:48.041 --> 27:52.958
Did they harass Hartung,
kill the women and Ricks?

27:53.041 --> 27:55.666
-I think it's them.
-We can't be certain.

27:57.000 --> 28:02.333
She was a nurse on a ward putting her
in contact with at least two victims.

28:02.416 --> 28:03.250
Nylander.

28:04.833 --> 28:07.291
We definitely need to question them, but…

28:08.458 --> 28:12.541
They won't be easy to find now that
everyone knows we're looking for them.

28:14.041 --> 28:16.750
-Any intel on the boyfriend?
-What the hell's this?

28:18.041 --> 28:20.625
A doctor called from the psychiatric ward.

28:20.708 --> 28:23.541
He says you questioned Bekker
without my knowledge.

28:23.625 --> 28:26.708
You grabbed him, Hess.
The guards had to separate you.

28:26.791 --> 28:28.208
What the hell is going on?

28:28.916 --> 28:29.750
Tell me!

28:38.875 --> 28:40.750
Yes, it's her.

28:40.833 --> 28:42.875
What do they think she did?

28:42.958 --> 28:45.916
Any contact?
Did she contact or threaten you?

28:46.000 --> 28:49.625
No, but you found something
that indicates…

28:50.833 --> 28:51.666
Liv, what is it?

28:53.625 --> 28:54.458
Engells?

28:55.625 --> 28:58.125
The police discovered
who the nurse's boyfriend is.

29:21.125 --> 29:23.833
-Hi, honey. I thought--
-<i>Where's Gustav?</i>

29:23.916 --> 29:25.916
He didn't go with the driver, right?

29:26.000 --> 29:28.625
<i>He did.</i>
<i>They left for tennis ten minutes ago.</i>

29:29.458 --> 29:30.791
<i>He wasn't allowed to cycle…</i>

29:31.750 --> 29:33.291
<i>Rosa? What is it?</i>

29:35.083 --> 29:37.250
<i>-Rosa? Honey?</i>
-You need to find him.

29:37.333 --> 29:41.000
<i>The police say</i>
<i>my driver is the nurse's boyfriend.</i>

29:48.625 --> 29:49.583
<i>Where are you?</i>

29:50.208 --> 29:54.708
I'll be there in two minutes.
I can see his location from his phone.

30:02.291 --> 30:03.125
Can you see him?

30:08.541 --> 30:09.375
Gustav?

30:12.250 --> 30:14.166
Can you hear me, Steen?

30:50.166 --> 30:53.333
Witnesses saw
a gray van leave the location.

30:53.416 --> 30:54.958
We need to put out an APB.

31:04.958 --> 31:06.791
They found the minister's car.

31:06.875 --> 31:10.250
Let's start by interviewing
the families and their employers.

31:10.333 --> 31:12.958
Nylander will coordinate
with intelligence services.

31:14.500 --> 31:15.875
I have to take this call.

31:16.750 --> 31:20.958
-Hi, Aksel. How was the meeting?
-<i>Well, it didn't go very well.</i>

31:21.041 --> 31:23.333
<i>-You really should have been there.</i>
-How so?

31:23.416 --> 31:24.500
<i>She broke down.</i>

31:26.250 --> 31:29.875
<i>I can't talk about it now.</i>
<i>I don't think she's asleep.</i>

31:29.958 --> 31:33.416
<i>Come and see us</i>
<i>before school tomorrow and we'll talk.</i>

31:33.500 --> 31:34.708
<i>All right. Bye.</i>

31:49.416 --> 31:53.000
TUESDAY, 20 OCTOBER

32:18.666 --> 32:23.750
Okay, so he didn't mention
a place he would visit or go?

32:23.833 --> 32:25.958
Maybe with friends or family?

32:26.041 --> 32:30.708
No. You just asked me that. He's new.
I didn't know he had a girlfriend.

32:34.083 --> 32:36.791
I'm sorry to repeat the questions,

32:36.875 --> 32:40.291
but we're looking for any clue.
Every minor detail counts.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.583
Something your driver said,

32:42.666 --> 32:46.625
or any detail you noticed about him.

32:47.250 --> 32:50.458
-Anything that can help us find--
-Rosa already answered!

32:52.958 --> 32:54.625
How could you let this happen?

32:55.666 --> 32:56.875
Don't you screen people?

32:57.625 --> 33:00.708
-We didn't--
-What if they took Kristine too?

33:02.208 --> 33:03.583
What if they did that too?

33:03.666 --> 33:07.416
We don't know about that yet.

33:07.500 --> 33:12.083
But it's important to bear in mind
that we know who they are.

33:12.166 --> 33:13.500
<i>We know who they are.</i>

33:13.583 --> 33:16.500
<i>Their child died from lung disease</i>

33:16.583 --> 33:19.125
<i>shortly after</i>
<i>he was removed from the home.</i>

33:19.750 --> 33:21.708
<i>They are blaming you.</i>

33:29.791 --> 33:32.375
<i>We're looking for the silver van</i>

33:32.458 --> 33:35.041
<i>seen speeding away</i>
<i>from the scene by witnesses.</i>

33:36.000 --> 33:38.916
<i>All bridges and main roads are blocked.</i>

33:39.708 --> 33:43.250
<i>We're keeping an eye on airports,</i>
<i>train stations, and ferries.</i>

33:45.208 --> 33:47.500
<i>They have two options now.</i>

33:48.625 --> 33:52.375
<i>To hide or surrender.</i>

33:55.625 --> 33:59.875
<i>If they hide,</i>
<i>we'll use all means to find them.</i>

34:01.166 --> 34:03.875
<i>The Special Intervention Unit</i>
<i>is standing by.</i>

34:18.041 --> 34:20.791
I want my son back. And my daughter.

34:22.250 --> 34:23.125
Find my kids.

34:26.458 --> 34:29.333
Get the Home Guard. We need more manpower.

34:29.416 --> 34:32.250
It's been 12 hours.
We've not heard from the kidnappers.

34:36.500 --> 34:37.416
-Hello.
-Hi.

34:37.500 --> 34:39.458
What's up? Off to school already?

34:40.666 --> 34:44.333
-I have breakfast with me for you both.
-We don't have to do it now.

34:44.416 --> 34:45.666
I heard the news.

34:48.291 --> 34:52.375
We'll drive.
Hop in, and we're off. Come on.

34:59.708 --> 35:04.583
Who'd like a muesli roll or a pastry?

35:05.625 --> 35:06.791
What do you think?

35:09.000 --> 35:12.125
Honey, I'm really sorry
I didn't make the meeting at school.

35:12.875 --> 35:14.125
I should have been there.

35:15.583 --> 35:17.583
But I'm on a really serious case.

35:20.375 --> 35:22.916
And I do know
that you're not happy right now.

35:23.625 --> 35:27.291
But it's just for little while
because very soon I'll be at home,

35:27.375 --> 35:29.458
and we'll be together all the time--

35:29.541 --> 35:31.041
Could I not live with Grandpa?

35:34.375 --> 35:35.708
Do you want to live there?

35:39.166 --> 35:40.791
He's never cross.

35:40.875 --> 35:43.916
He always lights candles
and we play Go Fish!

35:45.666 --> 35:47.166
I'm just happier at his place.

35:59.125 --> 36:02.791
You being happy is
the most important thing in the world.

36:08.458 --> 36:12.333
Why don't I come over to you tonight,
and we'll talk about it?

36:13.916 --> 36:15.666
That's a good idea, Le.

36:18.458 --> 36:19.291
Is that a deal?

36:23.625 --> 36:24.458
Cool.

36:33.291 --> 36:37.000
<i>Still no news of where they took the boy?</i>

36:37.083 --> 36:37.916
<i>Not yet.</i>

36:38.000 --> 36:39.958
<i>We found a room made to hide a child.</i>

36:40.041 --> 36:41.833
NATIONWIDE SEARCH
FOR GUSTAV HARTUNG

36:41.916 --> 36:44.250
And the iPad or laptop
from Skans' apartment?

36:44.333 --> 36:47.666
<i>It'll take time to recover</i>
<i>the deleted files on the laptop.</i>

36:47.750 --> 36:49.791
What have we got? Come on.

36:49.875 --> 36:54.291
I called the psychiatric ward in Roskilde.
Benedikte Skans had a hard time--

36:54.375 --> 36:56.250
What do we know about Rasouli?

36:56.750 --> 36:59.375
Former soldier.
Two tours in Afghanistan as a driver.

36:59.458 --> 37:00.541
His papers look good,

37:00.625 --> 37:03.458
but some of his colleagues say
he was getting shaky.

37:03.541 --> 37:05.541
-PTSD?
-Definitely possible.

37:05.625 --> 37:08.833
The huge loss they've had
makes them unpredictable.

37:08.916 --> 37:11.791
Everything points to them
being the murderers.

37:11.875 --> 37:15.416
No, it doesn't.
Let's stick to the evidence.

37:15.500 --> 37:18.166
They threatened Rosa Hartung,
and they took the boy.

37:18.250 --> 37:23.125
But we didn't find any signs of planning
a murder at their address, did we?

37:23.208 --> 37:26.458
<i>Not yet.</i>
<i>No DNA, finger prints, or chestnut men.</i>

37:26.541 --> 37:30.916
Skans had numerous run-ins
with the authorities. Quoting her diary:

37:31.625 --> 37:35.916
She's "a better mom than the fuckheads
who get to keep their kids."

37:36.000 --> 37:37.416
That proves jack shit.

37:38.375 --> 37:42.875
-Nylander, we have to talk to Bekker--
-Just drop Bekker already. Hess, stop it!

37:44.291 --> 37:46.625
Our top priority is finding that boy.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.041
Thulin, I need to talk to you.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.833
Mentioning Bekker
was perhaps a bit impulsive.

37:58.916 --> 38:01.500
Hess wanted to go. Let's talk about that.

38:01.583 --> 38:02.916
It wasn't Hess. It was me.

38:06.208 --> 38:07.875
I just spoke to his former boss.

38:07.958 --> 38:12.375
He has a long history
of mental instability.

38:15.333 --> 38:17.416
I know he lost his wife in a fire.

38:18.333 --> 38:21.833
-But I fail to see what--
-And their three-month-old daughter.

38:29.500 --> 38:32.083
Okay, but that doesn't mean he's wrong.

38:35.750 --> 38:39.000
I'm splitting you two up.
You're on Parliament and Rasouli.

38:39.750 --> 38:42.083
Skans and their home, the old foundry.

38:42.166 --> 38:45.708
Did we overlook anything in the room
they had for Gustav? Off you go.

39:14.750 --> 39:16.458
We'll stay until things calm down.

39:21.875 --> 39:23.291
He needs food, honey.

39:24.125 --> 39:25.875
He hasn't eaten since this morning.

39:32.250 --> 39:33.708
We shouldn't have taken him.

39:35.375 --> 39:37.750
When they found our address,
we should have dropped it.

39:38.750 --> 39:40.833
Maybe we should just take him back?

39:42.541 --> 39:45.833
And tell them everything.
We just wanted her to know how we felt.

39:51.833 --> 39:54.333
It's time she felt
what it's been like for us.

39:58.375 --> 39:59.458
What the hell's this?

40:02.041 --> 40:02.875
What the hell?

40:07.583 --> 40:09.666
-What are you doing?
-Let me go!

40:09.750 --> 40:10.833
What the hell?

40:11.583 --> 40:13.458
-Stop!
-She's not getting away with it.

40:13.541 --> 40:16.291
He's just a boy. Just a boy!

40:17.750 --> 40:18.750
I'm on your side.

40:23.333 --> 40:24.500
I miss him too.

40:27.583 --> 40:29.000
I miss him every single day.

40:33.625 --> 40:34.583
Come here.

40:55.666 --> 40:59.708
Did he not mention anywhere he went
with family or friends?

41:02.541 --> 41:06.291
We didn't speak much, but here's
the roster for the dates you wanted.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.875
He wasn't at all
like they say in the media.

41:09.958 --> 41:13.416
But it was mainly Rosa and Vogel
who dealt with him.

41:14.375 --> 41:17.625
-Is this correct?
-Vogel usually books the car, but yes.

41:17.708 --> 41:22.541
So Rasouli was definitely
driving the minister on the 14th?

41:23.541 --> 41:24.750
At this time, that night?

41:26.708 --> 41:29.666
-Where's Vogel?
-His office is in there.

41:51.791 --> 41:54.291
MISSING KRISTINE HARTUNG STILL ALIVE?

42:37.375 --> 42:39.416
Okay. Is he in my office?

42:46.625 --> 42:47.458
Hello.

42:48.625 --> 42:51.208
-Did you find Rasouli?
-No, not yet.

42:51.875 --> 42:53.083
How can I help?

42:53.166 --> 42:55.083
How long have you known the minister?

42:58.500 --> 43:02.833
Rosa and I were in high school together
and both studied political science.

43:02.916 --> 43:06.375
You've known each other a long time?
Through university, partners and…

43:07.291 --> 43:09.875
-starting a family.
-I haven't started a family.

43:09.958 --> 43:10.791
All right.

43:11.666 --> 43:15.375
But I've had the pleasure
of being part of her family.

43:15.458 --> 43:16.833
And of Steen's, of course.

43:16.916 --> 43:19.083
-And you knew Kristine?
-Of course.

43:21.125 --> 43:22.750
What's all this about?

43:24.708 --> 43:26.166
According to the roster,

43:26.250 --> 43:32.375
Rasouli was working on the 14th,
late at night.

43:32.458 --> 43:36.208
Is that correct?
Or did you give him the day off?

43:36.291 --> 43:41.416
Rosa had an award ceremony that day,
but it was canceled.

43:42.000 --> 43:42.833
So…

43:44.833 --> 43:48.125
Rasouli wrote
that he was working that night.

43:49.166 --> 43:53.416
Did you forget to tell him,
so he was waiting at the royal library?

43:55.083 --> 43:59.208
I've no idea. Why trust his notes though?

43:59.291 --> 44:02.500
-Shouldn't you be looking for him?
-Where were you that night?

44:03.458 --> 44:05.083
Or the night of 6 October?

44:06.958 --> 44:09.291
Or on 12 October around 6:00 p.m.?

44:10.708 --> 44:13.375
-Those are the times of the murders.
-Really?

44:15.916 --> 44:19.416
I'll answer your questions
at a formal interview with my lawyer.

44:26.291 --> 44:27.833
-It's Hess.
-<i>Genz here.</i>

44:27.916 --> 44:30.416
The minister's asking
if there is any news?

44:31.208 --> 44:34.666
-They're treating me like a suspect.
-A suspect of what?

44:34.750 --> 44:35.750
I'll be right there.

44:39.375 --> 44:40.291
I have to go.

45:03.958 --> 45:05.625
-What's up?
-<i>Did you talk to Genz?</i>

45:06.750 --> 45:07.791
No, why?

45:07.875 --> 45:10.583
He traced the silver van
driven by Skans and the driver.

45:10.666 --> 45:11.750
It's a rental.

45:11.833 --> 45:15.708
-<i>Where is it?</i>
-Somewhere in the forest. I'm on my way.

45:15.791 --> 45:17.833
Jansen and the SIU are there.

45:17.916 --> 45:20.125
-I'll be right there.
<i>-Look.</i>

45:20.208 --> 45:21.291
Something's wrong.

45:21.375 --> 45:25.750
According to the driver roster,
he might have an alibi.

45:25.833 --> 45:29.000
Looks like he was working
on the night of Jessie Kvium's murder.

45:29.083 --> 45:30.583
<i>Tell me about it later.</i>

45:30.666 --> 45:32.208
I'm heading to the forest now.

46:09.041 --> 46:10.166
Police!

47:45.666 --> 47:47.875
Jansen? Where's the boy?

47:47.958 --> 47:51.541
In the ambulance. He's unharmed,
but they're taking him to the hospital.

47:54.791 --> 47:57.083
-And the pathologist?
-She's not here yet.

47:57.166 --> 48:00.833
But they were still warm when we arrived,
so it happened a few hours ago.

48:01.333 --> 48:03.291
I think the woman went crazy.

48:03.375 --> 48:06.958
She used the knife on her boyfriend
before cutting her own throat.

48:07.041 --> 48:08.791
Any signs of anyone else?

48:11.333 --> 48:12.875
Did you even secure the scene?

48:14.875 --> 48:16.791
We need to search the forest.

48:16.875 --> 48:18.583
Call in the dogs.

48:18.666 --> 48:20.500
-You two, that way.
-Hess, why?

48:20.583 --> 48:22.083
-Follow me…
-What do you need?

48:22.208 --> 48:23.250
Come. Flashlight.

50:59.916 --> 51:00.750
Thulin.

51:02.083 --> 51:05.041
You need to send forensics
to Skans' and the driver's home.

51:21.166 --> 51:25.875
<i>You have one new message. First message.</i>

51:25.958 --> 51:27.500
<i>Hess, it's Nylander.</i>

51:27.583 --> 51:29.916
<i>Skans and Rasouli</i>
<i>appear to be the murderers.</i>

51:30.000 --> 51:32.083
<i>I'm stopping the search of the forest.</i>

51:32.166 --> 51:35.875
<i>The doctor examined Gustav Hartung.</i>
<i>He's hungry but otherwise unharmed.</i>

51:35.958 --> 51:37.166
How is the boy?

51:37.250 --> 51:39.416
-Did you find them? Any comments?
-Rosa, a picture?

51:39.500 --> 51:41.625
<i>See you at the station for a debrief.</i>

51:42.416 --> 51:44.416
<i>No more messages.</i>

51:44.500 --> 51:48.458
<i>Main menu. To play, press 1.</i>
<i>For voicemail greeting…</i>

52:04.833 --> 52:06.958
Are you sure you didn't hear them talk?

52:07.041 --> 52:09.958
I only heard them argue,
but not what about.

52:10.041 --> 52:13.833
I understand, but we just want to be sure.

52:13.916 --> 52:16.750
-They didn't say--
-No, Kristine wasn't mentioned.

52:18.916 --> 52:20.000
Is Gustav okay?

52:20.083 --> 52:22.916
Yes. Or we hope so.

52:23.875 --> 52:25.750
Any news about Kristine?

52:25.833 --> 52:27.041
No, sorry.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.916
So, what did you find out?

52:31.375 --> 52:37.083
I'm sorry, but we didn't find anything
to indicate that Kristine's alive.

52:37.166 --> 52:40.333
-What about her prints?
-And the chestnut men?

52:41.041 --> 52:42.416
My best guess is…

52:43.458 --> 52:46.958
that they got them from her stall
and used them to hurt you.

52:47.583 --> 52:50.000
-But like I said--
-That can't be true.

52:50.083 --> 52:51.500
You could be wrong.

52:55.041 --> 52:58.625
We found something
at the murderers' address today

52:58.708 --> 53:00.208
that closed the investigation.

53:00.291 --> 53:04.666
Nothing indicates
they had anything to do with Kristine.

53:32.958 --> 53:35.333
<i>I hope I can leave soon.</i>

53:35.416 --> 53:38.041
<i>There's no rush. She's asleep already.</i>

53:38.125 --> 53:40.541
<i>She didn't want to talk tonight.</i>

53:40.625 --> 53:46.708
-Doesn't she want to come home?
<i>-She wants to stay with me for a bit, so…</i>

53:47.416 --> 53:49.500
<i>I'm not sure what we should do.</i>

53:49.583 --> 53:52.291
We'll talk about it later.
I'll leave as soon as I can.

53:56.916 --> 53:58.625
Enjoy it, while it's cold.

54:01.916 --> 54:03.750
Thulin, aren't you joining us?

54:05.250 --> 54:06.166
Sure.

54:07.208 --> 54:12.791
Nylander, why did you stop
the investigation in the forest?

54:12.875 --> 54:14.750
I'm busy. I have a press briefing.

54:14.833 --> 54:19.291
The pathologist can't be certain
that Skans committed suicide.

54:19.958 --> 54:22.500
-The boyfriend has an alibi…
-Didn't you get my message?

54:22.583 --> 54:24.750
…for the murders of Kvium and Ricks.

54:24.833 --> 54:28.666
-Didn't you get my message? Hess?
-They didn't do it.

54:29.250 --> 54:30.916
Someone's playing tricks on us.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.583
They want us to believe
we solved the case.

54:33.666 --> 54:35.583
We need to talk to Bekker again.

54:36.666 --> 54:40.083
-What if you're wrong?
-Hess, I'm not wrong.

54:40.625 --> 54:42.208
Thulin, could you help him?

54:45.208 --> 54:50.208
-We need to talk to Bekker and check--
-You've got a nosebleed.

54:57.041 --> 54:59.750
I found this at the foundry. In a cooler.

55:17.750 --> 55:19.208
Why didn't we find it sooner?

55:20.958 --> 55:22.166
<i>Was the foundry locked?</i>

55:24.208 --> 55:26.041
-Did someone plant it?
-Easy now.

55:26.125 --> 55:29.875
It doesn't prove a damn thing,
and you know it.

55:29.958 --> 55:35.541
If we stop looking for her now, we risk…

55:35.625 --> 55:36.541
Let it go.

55:37.416 --> 55:38.291
If we…

57:32.000 --> 57:37.041
