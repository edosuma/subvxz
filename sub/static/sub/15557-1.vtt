02:41.529 --> 02:43.190
Robin Williger.

02:43.297 --> 02:46.892
He is a 15-year-old freshman
from Racine, Wisconsin.

02:47.001 --> 02:48.696
He enjoys studying history.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.429
He's on the debate team.

02:50.538 --> 02:53.803
Robin's future looked
very, very bright,

02:53.908 --> 02:55.739
but recently he was
diagnosed with cancer,

02:55.843 --> 02:57.401
a very tough kind of cancer.

02:57.511 --> 03:01.072
<i>Robin tells me he has</i>
<i>quit smoking, though,</i>

03:01.182 --> 03:04.413
and he no longer thinks
that cigarettes are cool.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.854
Whoo!

03:10.958 --> 03:14.223
And our final guest today
is Nick Naylor.

03:14.328 --> 03:18.890
Mr. Naylor is the vice president
of the Academy of Tobacco Studies.

03:18.999 --> 03:22.025
Now, they are the tobacco
industry's main lobby

03:22.136 --> 03:23.433
in Washington, D.C.

03:23.537 --> 03:26.597
And Mr. Naylor is
their chief spokesman.

03:44.592 --> 03:46.389
<i>Few people on this planet know</i>

03:46.493 --> 03:48.620
<i>what it is to be truly despised.</i>

03:48.729 --> 03:50.959
<i>Can you blame them?</i>

03:51.065 --> 03:53.431
<i>I earn a living</i>
<i>fronting an organization</i>

03:53.534 --> 03:56.799
<i>that kills 1,200 human beings a day.</i>

03:56.904 --> 03:58.098
<i>1,200 people.</i>

03:58.205 --> 04:00.696
<i>We're talking</i>
<i>two jumbojet plane loads</i>

04:00.808 --> 04:03.504
<i>of men, women and children.</i>

04:03.611 --> 04:04.635
<i>I mean, there's Attila,</i>

04:04.745 --> 04:06.269
<i>Genghis,</i>

04:06.380 --> 04:07.330
<i>and me,</i>

04:07.430 --> 04:08.643
<i>Nick Naylor,</i>

04:08.749 --> 04:09.773
<i>the face of cigarettes...</i>

04:09.883 --> 04:12.647
<i>the Colonel Sanders of nicotine.</i>

04:12.753 --> 04:14.220
<i>This is where I work,</i>

04:14.321 --> 04:16.846
<i>the Academy of Tobacco Studies.</i>

04:16.957 --> 04:19.118
<i>It was established</i>
<i>by seven gentlemen</i>

04:19.226 --> 04:20.817
<i>you may recognize from C-SPAN.</i>

04:20.928 --> 04:23.556
<i>These guys realized quick</i>
<i>if they were going to claim</i>

04:23.664 --> 04:24.756
<i>that cigarettes were not addictive,</i>

04:24.865 --> 04:27.026
<i>they better have proof.</i>

04:27.134 --> 04:28.965
<i>This is the man they rely on,</i>

04:29.069 --> 04:31.196
<i>Erhardt Von Grupten Mundt.</i>

04:31.305 --> 04:33.569
<i>They found him in Germany.</i>

04:33.674 --> 04:35.198
<i>I won't go into the details.</i>

04:35.309 --> 04:36.469
<i>He's been testing the link</i>

04:36.577 --> 04:37.805
<i>between nicotine</i>
<i>and lung cancer</i>

04:37.911 --> 04:41.176
<i>for 30 years and hasn't found</i>
<i>any conclusive results.</i>

04:41.282 --> 04:42.232
<i>The man's a genius.</i>

04:42.332 --> 04:43.944
<i>He could disprove gravity.</i>

04:44.051 --> 04:45.712
<i>Then we've got our sharks.</i>

04:45.819 --> 04:47.582
<i>We draft them out</i>
<i>of Ivy League law schools</i>

04:47.688 --> 04:49.986
<i>and give them time-shares</i>
<i>and sports cars.</i>

04:50.090 --> 04:51.648
<i>It's just like</i>
<i>a John Grisham novel-</i>

04:51.759 --> 04:54.319
<i>you know, without all the espionage.</i>

04:54.428 --> 04:57.659
<i>Most importantly,</i>
<i>we've got spin control.</i>

04:57.765 --> 04:59.596
<i>That's where I come in.</i>

04:59.700 --> 05:01.065
<i>I get paid to talk.</i>

05:01.168 --> 05:02.726
<i>I don't have an MD or law degree.</i>

05:05.172 --> 05:08.335
<i>I have a bachelor's in</i>
<i>kicking ass and taking names.</i>

05:08.442 --> 05:10.876
<i>You know that guy</i>
<i>who can pick up any girl?</i>

05:10.978 --> 05:12.036
<i>I'm him</i>

05:12.146 --> 05:13.238
<i>on crack.</i>

05:16.550 --> 05:18.541
This is obviously a heated issue

05:18.652 --> 05:21.348
and we do have a lot
that we want to cover today.

05:22.289 --> 05:23.551
Nick, do you have a question?

05:23.657 --> 05:24.749
Joan,

05:24.858 --> 05:28.658
how on earth would
Big Tobacco profit

05:28.762 --> 05:31.196
off of the loss of this young man?

05:31.298 --> 05:33.493
Now, I hate to think
in such callous terms,

05:33.600 --> 05:36.694
but, if anything,
we'd be losing a customer.

05:36.804 --> 05:39.898
It's not only our hope,
it's in our best interest

05:40.007 --> 05:42.237
to keep Robin alive and smoking.

05:42.343 --> 05:44.004
- That's ludicrous.
- Let me tell you something,

05:44.111 --> 05:45.942
Joan, and please,
let me share something

05:46.046 --> 05:49.675
with the fine, concerned
people in the audience today.

05:49.783 --> 05:53.344
The Ron Goodes of this world...

05:53.454 --> 05:56.014
want the Robin Willigers to die.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.215
- What?
- You know why?

05:57.324 --> 05:58.916
So that their budgets will go up.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.893
This is nothing less than
trafficking in human misery,

06:01.995 --> 06:03.758
and you, sir, ought
to be ashamed of yourself.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.354
I ought to be ashamed of myself?

06:05.466 --> 06:08.594
As a matter of fact,
we're about to launch...

06:08.702 --> 06:11.694
a $50 million campaign

06:11.805 --> 06:15.969
aimed at persuading kids
not to smoke.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.237
Because I think
that we can all agree

06:18.345 --> 06:20.472
that there is nothing
more important

06:20.581 --> 06:21.912
than America's children.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.380
All right, now,
that's something that

06:23.484 --> 06:25.247
we're going to want
to know more about.

06:25.352 --> 06:26.512
But I have to take a short break.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.713
Hang on, a lot more coming.

06:31.692 --> 06:34.627
$50 million?! Are you
out of your fucking mind?!

06:34.728 --> 06:35.678
<i>Everyone has a boss.</i>

06:35.778 --> 06:36.679
<i>BR just happens</i>

06:36.779 --> 06:38.254
<i>to be mine.</i>

06:38.365 --> 06:40.230
<i>He came from the vending</i>
<i>machine world.</i>

06:40.334 --> 06:41.995
<i>This made him tough.</i>

06:43.370 --> 06:46.567
<i>The name BR came</i>
<i>from his tour in Vietnam.</i>

06:46.673 --> 06:49.767
<i>The people who know</i>
<i>its meaning are all dead.</i>

06:49.877 --> 06:51.310
The deal was five million!

06:51.412 --> 06:54.176
$5 million will get you
a couple of subway posters.

06:54.281 --> 06:55.248
It's not going to impress anyone.

06:55.348 --> 06:56.475
That's the idea, Nick.

06:56.583 --> 06:57.550
You'll be thanking me soon.

06:57.650 --> 06:58.778
This'll probably get you great press.

06:58.886 --> 07:01.252
I gotta call the captain
and see if this is gonna fly.

07:01.355 --> 07:03.448
Get your ass back to D.C.

07:17.271 --> 07:19.239
Thank you so much for coming.

07:21.074 --> 07:22.024
Mr. Naylor?

07:22.124 --> 07:23.075
It's your turn.

07:23.177 --> 07:25.509
Ah.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.671
Joey is such a bright young man.

07:27.781 --> 07:28.765
We all look forward

07:28.865 --> 07:30.612
to his coming out
of his shell a little.

07:30.717 --> 07:31.945
He's a bit shy.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.849
Yeah, he gets that from his mother.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.760
Hey, Joey.

07:45.866 --> 07:48.232
Please don't ruin my childhood.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.394
Come on, Joey. Trust me.

07:58.312 --> 08:01.372
How many of you want to be
lawyers when you grow up?

08:01.482 --> 08:02.482
Right.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.073
How about...

08:04.184 --> 08:05.913
movie stars?

08:07.354 --> 08:08.480
How about lobbyists?

08:08.589 --> 08:09.556
What's that?

08:09.656 --> 08:11.557
It's kind of like being a movie star.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.421
It's what I do.
I talk for a living.

08:13.527 --> 08:14.687
What do you talk about?

08:14.795 --> 08:16.854
I speak on behalf of cigarettes.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.192
My mom used to smoke.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.926
She says that cigarettes kill.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.434
Really? Now, is your mommy a doctor?

08:23.537 --> 08:24.487
No.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.267
A scientific researcher of some kind?

08:26.373 --> 08:27.601
No.

08:27.708 --> 08:28.675
Well, she doesn't exactly sound

08:28.775 --> 08:30.141
like a credible expert,
now, does she?

08:31.678 --> 08:32.628
Don't feel bad.

08:32.727 --> 08:34.578
It's okay to listen to your mom.

08:34.681 --> 08:37.047
I mean, it's good to listen
to your parents... Joey.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.448
All I'm suggesting

08:39.553 --> 08:41.953
is that there will always
be people trying to tell you

08:42.054 --> 08:44.216
what to do and what to think.

08:44.324 --> 08:45.689
There probably already are
people doing that.

08:45.792 --> 08:46.742
Am I right?

08:46.842 --> 08:47.760
Yes.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.591
I'm here to say

08:49.696 --> 08:53.132
that when someone tries to act
like some sort of an expert,

08:53.233 --> 08:56.725
you can respond, "Who says?"

08:56.837 --> 08:58.532
<i>So, cigarettes are good for you?</i>

08:58.639 --> 09:00.539
- No!
- No, that's not...

09:00.641 --> 09:01.801
That's not what I'm getting at.

09:01.909 --> 09:04.241
My point is that you have
to think for yourself.

09:04.344 --> 09:06.073
You have to challenge authority.

09:06.179 --> 09:08.443
If your parents told you
that chocolate was dangerous,

09:08.549 --> 09:10.073
would you just take their word for it?

09:10.183 --> 09:11.275
No.

09:11.385 --> 09:12.385
Exactly.

09:12.486 --> 09:14.317
So perhaps instead of acting
like sheep

09:14.421 --> 09:15.405
when it comes to cigarettes,

09:15.505 --> 09:16.922
you should find out for yourself.

09:17.024 --> 09:18.150
Okay, then.

09:18.258 --> 09:20.624
Thank you, Mr. Naylor,
for joining us.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.663
<i>Every week we meet here at Bert's.</i>

09:32.773 --> 09:34.764
<i>Together, we represent</i>
<i>the chief spokespeople</i>

09:42.950 --> 09:44.110

Why?

09:45.267 --> 09:46.446
<i>Dateline's doing a segment</i>

09:46.553 --> 09:48.145

10:05.705 --> 10:06.934
Any ideas?

10:07.040 --> 10:08.337
I don't know.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.774
Deformed kids are tough.

10:10.877 --> 10:13.141
I'm lucky my product only makes
them bald before it kills them.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.146
You could hug the kids.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.216
They're not going
to let me hug the kids.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.875
Who's doing the segment,
Donaldson or Sawyer?

10:18.986 --> 10:19.936
Sawyer, probably.

10:20.036 --> 10:20.937
You're fucked.

10:21.037 --> 10:21.938
Why?

10:22.038 --> 10:23.115
Cause she's gonna hug them.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.418
Look, if you see her going in
for a hug,

10:25.525 --> 10:28.358
maybe just box her out,
get in there before she does.

You know, you can beat
a Breathalyzer

10:58.525 --> 11:01.517
- by sucking on activated charcoal tablets?
- Really?

11:01.628 --> 11:03.186
Maybe we should change
our campaign to

11:03.296 --> 11:05.264
"If You Must Drink and Drive,
Suck Charcoal."

11:05.365 --> 11:06.423
Yeah, but don't the police wonder

11:06.533 --> 11:07.483
why you're sucking on charcoal?

11:07.583 --> 11:09.331
There's no law against charcoal.

11:09.436 --> 11:10.926
- Yet.
- Yet.

11:15.809 --> 11:18.801
Dad, why is the American
government the best government?

11:18.912 --> 11:20.436
Because of our
endless appeals system.

11:23.550 --> 11:26.075
Joe, you're not writing down
what I just said are you?

11:26.186 --> 11:27.346
Mm-hmm.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.445
Joey, stop for a second.

11:29.556 --> 11:31.046
What is the subject of your essay?

11:31.158 --> 11:33.956
Why is American government
the best government in the world.

11:34.061 --> 11:35.688
Your teacher crafted that question?

11:35.796 --> 11:37.559
Yeah. Why?

11:37.664 --> 11:40.462
Well... I'll look past
the obvious problems

11:40.567 --> 11:41.864
in syntax for a moment,

11:41.968 --> 11:44.061
and I'll focus more on the core
of the question.

11:44.171 --> 11:45.365
I mean, "A,"

11:45.472 --> 11:48.100
does America have
the best government in the world?

11:48.208 --> 11:49.869
And "B," what constitutes
a "best government"?

11:49.976 --> 11:52.410
Is it crime, is it poverty, literacy?

11:52.512 --> 11:53.945
Hmm?

11:54.047 --> 11:55.014
And America- definitely not best.

11:55.114 --> 11:56.276
Perhaps not even better than most.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.748
We do have a very
entertaining government...

11:57.851 --> 11:59.148
Dad.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.083
I'm sorry.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.823
Are you familiar with the term "B.S."?

12:04.925 --> 12:06.483
Bullshit.

12:06.593 --> 12:07.855
Yes, exactly.

12:07.961 --> 12:10.862
B.S., if I may, is what
questions like the one

12:10.964 --> 12:12.864
your teacher posed are made for.

12:12.966 --> 12:14.900
Because even if America
had the best government,

12:15.001 --> 12:16.525
there'd be no way to prove it.

12:16.636 --> 12:17.967
And how many pages are you writing?

12:18.071 --> 12:19.021
Two pages.

12:19.121 --> 12:20.664
Two pages...

12:20.774 --> 12:22.332
Definitely not in two pages.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.603
So what am I supposed to write?

12:24.711 --> 12:26.406
You can write whatever you want.

12:26.513 --> 12:27.912
Okay.

12:28.014 --> 12:29.014
Write about...

12:29.116 --> 12:31.516
write about America's
amazing ability

12:31.618 --> 12:34.610
to make profit by breaking down
trading tariffs

12:34.721 --> 12:37.087
and bringing American jobs
to Third World countries.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.124
Or how good we are
at executing felons.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.853
They're all correct answers.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.929
I can do that?

12:43.029 --> 12:44.553
See, Joey, that's the beauty
of argument.

12:44.664 --> 12:47.064
'Cause if you argue correctly,
you're never wrong.

12:54.775 --> 12:57.676
Dad, if I finish
this essay within an hour,

12:57.778 --> 12:59.541
can we stay up all night?

12:59.646 --> 13:04.310
That's a negotiation,
not an argument.

13:04.417 --> 13:07.147
Well, Conway, see you made it.

13:07.254 --> 13:09.279
Yeah, I guess that little
voice was wrong.

13:09.389 --> 13:10.481
I feel better.

13:10.590 --> 13:11.750
I feel a lot better, too.

13:11.858 --> 13:14.418
As a matter of fact, I never
felt so good in my life.

13:14.528 --> 13:16.120
How about a cigarette?

13:32.979 --> 13:34.071
Is he?

13:34.181 --> 13:35.273
Yeah.

13:37.384 --> 13:40.820
Hey.

13:40.921 --> 13:44.357
Nick, you still own a watch, don't you?

13:44.457 --> 13:45.651
Jill, I can't help feeling

13:45.759 --> 13:47.283
Joey's getting the wrong idea
about his dad.

13:47.394 --> 13:48.918
It would be great if I could spend

13:49.029 --> 13:50.553
a little more time with him,
you know?

13:50.664 --> 13:54.156
To give him a fair
and balanced perspective.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.132
Nick, you had plenty
of time for that.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.703
Now you're his weekend guardian.

13:57.804 --> 13:59.829
Besides, he has Brad.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.032
He still needs his father.

14:01.141 --> 14:03.336
Nick.

14:03.443 --> 14:04.535
You have a second?

14:06.246 --> 14:07.577
Sure, Brad.

14:07.681 --> 14:11.447
Nick, your job
and everything aside,

14:11.551 --> 14:13.485
I hope you understand
that secondhand smoke's

14:13.587 --> 14:15.282
a real killer.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.253
What are you talking about?

14:17.357 --> 14:18.984
I just hope you're providing

14:19.092 --> 14:21.652
a smoke-free environment
for Joey, that's all I'm saying.

14:21.761 --> 14:23.956
Brad, I'm his father.

14:24.064 --> 14:26.396
You're the guy fucking his mom.

14:28.802 --> 14:31.100
That was unnecessary.

14:31.271 --> 14:34.707
Thank you all.
Thank you all for coming.

14:34.808 --> 14:37.276
Tobacco is winning the war.

14:37.377 --> 14:40.574
The war against our children.

14:40.680 --> 14:43.979
They like to use cartoons
and symbols to hook our kids.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.951
Well, now we have
a symbol of our own.

14:47.053 --> 14:49.248
Doctor.

14:49.356 --> 14:52.120
It is my hope that
within the year

14:52.225 --> 14:53.920
every cigarette package

14:54.027 --> 14:57.053
sold in America
will carry this symbol.

14:57.163 --> 14:59.393
Perhaps then, cigarettes
will finally be labeled

14:59.499 --> 15:02.593
appropriately as poison.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.567
I will be holding
a congressional hearing

15:04.671 --> 15:07.401
to discuss the inclusion
of the skull and crossbones

15:07.507 --> 15:08.974
in the next two weeks.

15:09.075 --> 15:10.474
As usual, I extend
an open invitation

15:10.577 --> 15:13.068
to big tobacco.

15:13.179 --> 15:17.172
Perhaps this time they will
grace us with their presence.

15:17.284 --> 15:18.581
And their answers.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.084
Thank you very much.

15:24.791 --> 15:28.227
People, what is going on out there?

15:28.328 --> 15:31.957
I look down this table,
all I see are white flags.

15:32.065 --> 15:34.693
Our numbers are down
all across the board.

15:34.801 --> 15:36.666
Teen smoking-
our bread and butter,

15:36.770 --> 15:38.499
is falling like a shit from heaven.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.301
We don't sell Tic Tacs,
for Christ's sake.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.070
We sell cigarettes.

15:44.177 --> 15:48.113
And they're cool and available
and addictive.

15:48.214 --> 15:49.841
The job is almost done for us.

15:51.618 --> 15:56.521
This environmentalist
is challenging us.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.183
We have to have an answer.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.987
I'm asking you,

16:01.094 --> 16:02.925
when this cocksucker puts
Captain Hook on our products,

16:03.029 --> 16:04.553
what the fuck are we going to do?

16:04.664 --> 16:07.224
- BR.
- Yeah, Nick.

16:07.334 --> 16:08.528
If I may.

16:08.635 --> 16:11.069
In 1910,

16:11.171 --> 16:13.662
the U.S. Was producing
ten billion cigarettes a year.

16:13.773 --> 16:14.899
By 1930,

16:15.008 --> 16:16.976
we were up to 123 billion.

16:17.077 --> 16:19.045
What happened in between?

16:19.145 --> 16:20.806
Three things.

16:20.914 --> 16:21.898
A world war,

16:21.998 --> 16:25.850
dieting... and movies.

16:25.952 --> 16:27.180
Movies?

16:27.287 --> 16:30.313
1927- talking pictures are born.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.653
Suddenly, directors need to give
their actors

16:32.759 --> 16:34.693
something to do
while they're talking.

16:34.794 --> 16:37.490
Cary Grant, Carole Lombard
are lighting up.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.064
Bette Davis- a chimney.

16:39.165 --> 16:40.462
And Bogart-
remember the first picture

16:40.567 --> 16:41.625
with him and Lauren Bacall?

16:41.735 --> 16:44.203
Well, yea... not specifically.

16:44.304 --> 16:45.566
Oh, she sort

16:45.672 --> 16:47.765
of shimmies in
through the doorway,

16:47.874 --> 16:49.967
19 years old.

16:50.076 --> 16:51.543
Pure sex.

16:51.644 --> 16:52.594
She says,

16:52.694 --> 16:54.875
"Anyone got a match?"

16:54.981 --> 16:56.676
And Bogie throws
the matches at her...

16:58.184 --> 17:00.084
and she catches them.

17:00.186 --> 17:03.747
Greatest romance of the century.

17:03.857 --> 17:06.018
How'd it start?
Lighting a cigarette.

17:06.126 --> 17:08.594
These days when someone
smokes in the movies,

17:08.694 --> 17:11.925
they're either a psychopath
or a European.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.932
The message Hollywood
needs to send out

17:14.034 --> 17:16.002
is smoking is cool.

17:16.102 --> 17:18.400
<i>We need the cast of <i>Will and Grace</i></i>

17:18.505 --> 17:19.869
smoking in their living room.

17:19.973 --> 17:22.203
Forrest Gump puffing away
between his box of chocolates.

17:22.308 --> 17:25.709
Hugh Grant earning back
the love of Julia Roberts

17:25.811 --> 17:30.112
by buying her favorite brand-
her Virginia Slims.

17:30.216 --> 17:33.743
Most of the actors smoke already.

17:33.853 --> 17:36.083
If they start doing it on-screen,

17:36.189 --> 17:38.885
we can put the sex
back into cigarettes.

17:38.992 --> 17:41.552
Well, it's a thought.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.458
I was hoping for something
a little more inspiring,

17:43.563 --> 17:44.587
but at least you're thinking.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.062
Rest of you people,
slam your fucking brains

17:46.166 --> 17:47.116
against your desks

17:47.216 --> 17:49.761
until something useful comes out.

17:49.869 --> 17:51.769
That was awesome.

17:51.871 --> 17:52.895
Thank you.

17:53.006 --> 17:54.997
Nick, you've been summoned.

17:55.108 --> 17:56.108
Captain wants to see you.

17:56.209 --> 17:57.540
<i>He saw the Joan show.</i>

17:57.644 --> 17:58.736
What'd he think?

17:58.845 --> 18:00.642
Get your ass on the next flight
to Winston-Salem.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.118
<i>Most people have this image</i>
<i>in their heads</i>

18:06.219 --> 18:08.312
<i>of tobacco executives</i>
<i>jet-setting around the world</i>

18:08.421 --> 18:10.616
<i>on private planes,</i>
<i>eating foie gras</i>

18:10.723 --> 18:12.088
<i>as they count their money.</i>

18:12.192 --> 18:14.319
<i>Not me.</i>

18:14.427 --> 18:16.725
<i>I like to ride with the people.</i>

18:16.830 --> 18:18.354
<i>Know your clients.</i>

18:18.465 --> 18:20.660
<i>My people cram themselves</i>
<i>into a tiny seat,</i>

18:20.767 --> 18:22.632
<i>pop a Xanax and dream</i>
<i>of the moment</i>

18:22.735 --> 18:25.670
<i>they can stuff their face</i>
<i>with fresh tobacco.</i>

18:25.772 --> 18:28.536
<i>If I can convince just one of</i>
<i>these kids to pick up smoking,</i>

18:28.641 --> 18:30.905
<i>I've paid for my flight-round-trip.</i>

18:39.352 --> 18:43.152
<i>The Captain is the last great</i>
<i>man of tobacco.</i>

18:43.256 --> 18:44.985
<i>He introduced filters</i>

18:45.091 --> 18:48.549
<i>when cigarettes first got</i>
<i>slammed by Reader's Digest.</i>

18:48.661 --> 18:53.030
<i>Later, he founded</i>
<i>the Academy of Tobacco Studies.</i>

18:53.133 --> 18:56.000
<i>The club was founded</i>
<i>by the tobacco barons in 1890</i>

18:56.102 --> 18:59.538
<i>so they'd have a place</i>
<i>to get away from their wives.</i>

19:01.975 --> 19:05.502
<i>Here, the Captain is a legend-</i>

19:05.612 --> 19:07.944
<i>a self-made man who started</i>
<i>from nothing,</i>

19:08.047 --> 19:10.845
<i>and ended up with everything...</i>

19:10.950 --> 19:14.147
<i>except, evidently, a son.</i>

19:14.254 --> 19:16.484
Nick, my boy.

19:16.589 --> 19:19.683
You're just in time for mud.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.384
Thank you.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.189
Sit down there. Yeah.

19:25.532 --> 19:27.727
Yeah.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.825
You know the secret
to a really good julep?

19:29.936 --> 19:31.631
No, sir.

19:31.738 --> 19:34.104
Well, you crush the mint

19:34.207 --> 19:37.301
down onto the ice with your thumb

19:37.410 --> 19:39.844
and you grind it in, see?

19:39.946 --> 19:42.574
And it releases the menthol.

19:44.184 --> 19:45.184
Hmm.

19:45.285 --> 19:46.684
Now you know who taught me that?

19:46.786 --> 19:47.753
No, sir. Who?

19:47.853 --> 19:49.617
Fidel Castro.

19:54.093 --> 19:56.186
Do you remember 1952?

19:56.296 --> 19:59.527
Well, sir, I wasn't alive in 1952.

19:59.632 --> 20:04.365
Good Lord, I was in Korea
shooting Chinese in 1952.

20:04.470 --> 20:06.631
Really?

20:06.739 --> 20:09.003
Today they're our best customer.

20:09.108 --> 20:11.736
Next time we won't have to shoot
so many of them, will we?

20:11.844 --> 20:13.573
No, sir.

20:13.680 --> 20:17.673
<i>1952 was the year</i>
<i>Reader's Digest</i>

20:17.784 --> 20:20.651
nailed us with
the whole health aspect.

20:20.753 --> 20:23.244
As Churchill said,

20:23.356 --> 20:25.620
that was perhaps the end
of our beginning.

20:25.725 --> 20:29.058
Tell me,

20:29.162 --> 20:31.096
do you enjoy your current work, Nick?

20:31.197 --> 20:32.181
Yes, sir.

20:32.281 --> 20:33.698
It's challenging...

20:33.800 --> 20:37.395
If you can do tobacco,
you can do anything.

20:37.503 --> 20:40.336
Yes, sir, I like that.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.840
You know, Nick, you remind me

20:42.942 --> 20:45.172
just a little bit
of myself when I was your age.

20:45.278 --> 20:47.906
Well, thank you, sir.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.845
Like that Joan Lunden show you did.

20:49.949 --> 20:52.213
You could have given up,
cried, apologized,

20:52.318 --> 20:53.318
but you didn't.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.353
You stayed loyal.

20:55.455 --> 21:00.324
And you gave it
to that son of a bitch good.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.986
My pleasure.

21:06.132 --> 21:09.295
Now, BR's come under the idea

21:09.402 --> 21:12.166
that we should start bribing
producers in Hollywood

21:12.272 --> 21:15.935
to make the actors smoke on screen.

21:16.042 --> 21:19.034
You know, like in the old days.

21:19.145 --> 21:21.409
Say, that's, uh...

21:21.514 --> 21:23.778
that's a great idea.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.316
Mm-hmm.

21:25.418 --> 21:26.942
Smart man, that BR.

21:27.053 --> 21:28.577
Oh, yeah, yeah.

21:28.688 --> 21:30.212
And loyal.

21:49.842 --> 21:50.809
Yes, sir?

21:50.909 --> 21:52.742
Have a seat, Ron.

22:03.489 --> 22:07.892
You, see, Ron, I can't be
everywhere I'm needed.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.894
That's why I send
people like you

22:09.996 --> 22:11.327
to speak on my behalf.

22:11.431 --> 22:15.094
When you're there,
you're not Ron Goode,

22:15.201 --> 22:17.169
the guy your friends probably like,

22:17.270 --> 22:19.830
you're Senator Finistirre's aide,

22:19.939 --> 22:23.204
and your name really doesn't matter.

22:23.309 --> 22:25.209
So, when

22:25.311 --> 22:28.007
Ron Goode acts
like a complete asshole

22:28.114 --> 22:30.810
<i>on the <i>Joan Lunden Show,</i></i>

22:30.917 --> 22:34.011
<i>I am being an asshole</i>
<i>on the <i>Joan Lunden Show.</i></i>

22:34.120 --> 22:35.781
Senator, sir, he sprang on me like...

22:35.888 --> 22:39.085
Where in the hell
did you find cancer boy?

22:39.192 --> 22:41.626
He was supposed to be quite reliable.

22:41.728 --> 22:44.561
The Pulmonary Council
was one of his references.

22:44.664 --> 22:46.359
Fucking nonprofits.

22:50.103 --> 22:52.833
When you're looking
for a cancer kid,

22:52.939 --> 22:54.236
he should be hopeless.

22:54.340 --> 22:55.898
He should have a wheelchair.

22:56.008 --> 22:58.169
He should have trouble talking.

22:58.277 --> 23:01.007
He should have
a little pet goldfish

23:01.114 --> 23:02.706
he carries around
in a ziplock bag-

23:02.815 --> 23:03.873
hopeless.

23:03.983 --> 23:06.247
I apologize, sir, but if it wasn't

23:06.352 --> 23:07.683
- for Nick Naylor...
- Nick Naylor?

23:09.589 --> 23:13.958
Don't you even think
of using him as an excuse.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.051
The man shills bullshit for a living.

23:16.162 --> 23:18.130
You work for a fucking senator.

23:18.231 --> 23:20.495
A senator who is supposed
to be tough on tobacco.

23:20.600 --> 23:23.467
Have a little... pride,
for God's sake.

23:23.569 --> 23:27.801
It won't happen again, sir,
I promise.

23:30.443 --> 23:33.970
All right, you're excused.

23:39.852 --> 23:41.183
<i>Sometimes I feel like</i>

23:41.287 --> 23:43.983
a Colombian drug dealer.

23:45.792 --> 23:50.354
The other day, my own granddaughter,
flesh of flesh of my own loins,

23:50.463 --> 23:53.830
asked me, "Granddaddy, is it true

23:53.933 --> 23:56.800
cigarettes are bad for you?"

23:59.205 --> 24:01.765
We got to do something, Nick.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.136
I think you're our man.

24:03.242 --> 24:04.971
Thank you, sir.

24:05.077 --> 24:07.341
I want you to work
on this Hollywood project.

24:07.447 --> 24:09.938
Get out there the next
few weeks, stir things up

24:10.049 --> 24:13.985
and report directly to me.

24:14.086 --> 24:15.144
Sir, about the,

24:15.254 --> 24:18.314
the $50 million.

24:18.424 --> 24:21.325
Anti teen-smoking advertising.

24:21.427 --> 24:24.919
Well, shit, I sure hope
it's not too persuasive.

24:26.599 --> 24:27.725
I hope.

24:39.245 --> 24:40.212
Nick,

24:40.312 --> 24:42.144
you're family now.

24:42.248 --> 24:44.876
Tobacco takes care of its own, eh?

24:44.984 --> 24:46.918
Thank you, sir.

24:59.832 --> 25:00.799
Mr. Naylor?

25:00.899 --> 25:01.867
Hi.

25:01.968 --> 25:03.401
Hi. Welcome to Tobacco One.

25:03.503 --> 25:04.765
Thank you.

25:04.871 --> 25:07.499
The captain told me to take
extra special care of you today.

25:07.607 --> 25:10.041
So if there is anything
at all I can do

25:10.142 --> 25:11.404
to make your flight
more pleasant,

25:11.511 --> 25:14.776
you be sure and let me know now.

25:26.959 --> 25:28.051
BR.

25:28.160 --> 25:29.110
Pleasant flight?

25:29.210 --> 25:31.254
Oh! You could say that.

25:31.364 --> 25:33.127
Came up on the Captain's plane.

25:33.232 --> 25:35.132
Oh, it's quite the way to travel.

25:35.234 --> 25:37.099
I wouldn't know.

25:37.203 --> 25:38.465
No? You never been on Tobacco One

25:38.571 --> 25:41.802
with those seats, that kitchen,

25:41.908 --> 25:43.569
that stewardess, Tiffany?

25:43.676 --> 25:45.701
Haven't had the chance yet.

25:45.811 --> 25:47.108
Oh, well, you really must try it.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.272
It's the only way to travel.

25:49.382 --> 25:52.613
What'd he think of your $50 million
anti-smoking campaign?

25:52.718 --> 25:54.652
Oh, the $50 million
anti teen-smoking campaign?

25:54.754 --> 25:55.704
Yeah.

25:55.804 --> 25:56.915
Yeah, he gave that the go-ahead.

25:57.023 --> 25:58.183
Oh, and he loved your idea

25:58.291 --> 25:59.588
to put cigarettes back into movies.

25:59.692 --> 26:02.252
- That was your idea.
- Oh, yeah?

26:02.361 --> 26:04.488
- He must have gotten confused.
- Hmm.

26:04.597 --> 26:09.000
Yeah. Well, either way,
he was pretty blown away.

26:09.101 --> 26:11.763
Right. Well, get a flight to L.A.

26:11.871 --> 26:12.963
I'll get you a meeting
with Jeff Megall.

26:13.072 --> 26:14.096
Who?

26:14.206 --> 26:15.468
Hollywood super agent.

26:15.575 --> 26:19.238
Runs the agency EGO:
Entertainment Global Offices.

26:19.345 --> 26:20.903
<i>This guy is the entertainment business.</i>

26:21.013 --> 26:23.277
And you are cigarettes, BR.

26:23.382 --> 26:25.247
Whatever.

26:26.852 --> 26:28.979
Yeah, but it's not a vacation,
it's a learning experience.

26:29.088 --> 26:31.147
And California is one
of the fastest-growing

26:31.257 --> 26:32.451
states, it's got

26:32.558 --> 26:34.253
the largest number of electoral
votes in the country.

26:34.360 --> 26:37.158
I mean, this could be
a very good trip for Joey.

26:37.263 --> 26:38.594
You know what?
Don't smooth-talk me.

26:38.698 --> 26:39.698
You're not going to
take him sightseeing.

26:39.799 --> 26:40.857
You're probably going

26:40.967 --> 26:42.958
to take him
to some lung cancer symposium

26:43.069 --> 26:45.003
where a guy with an electronic
voice box will tell him

26:45.104 --> 26:46.264
that his father is the devil.

26:46.372 --> 26:47.532
That's unfair.

26:47.640 --> 26:48.937
Unfair? What about Virginia?

26:49.041 --> 26:50.406
And what about Virginia?

26:50.509 --> 26:52.272
You took him to a cigarette factory.

26:52.378 --> 26:54.243
No, I took him to a tobacco farm.

26:54.347 --> 26:55.541
That's hardly the same thing.

26:55.648 --> 26:57.639
This conversation's over.

27:01.587 --> 27:03.612
Oh, fuck.

27:03.789 --> 27:06.451
Last week we had another
disgruntled postman.

27:06.559 --> 27:07.559
Of course,

27:07.660 --> 27:08.820
<i>an hour later the <i>Washington Post</i></i>

27:08.928 --> 27:11.726
is calling me on the phone-
godless swine.

27:11.831 --> 27:13.355
I said to 'em, I says,

27:13.466 --> 27:17.493
"Now if a plane crashes
on account of pilot error,

27:17.603 --> 27:18.968
do you blame the Boeing Corporation?"

27:19.071 --> 27:20.071
Nice.

27:20.172 --> 27:21.537
- That's a good one.
- Thank you.

27:21.641 --> 27:24.201
If some booze-besotten drunk
runs someone down,

27:24.310 --> 27:26.244
do you go banging on the doors
at General Motors?

27:26.345 --> 27:27.676
Tell me you didn't say that.

27:27.780 --> 27:29.145
Mm-hmm.

27:29.248 --> 27:31.239
Have either of you heard of a
reporter named Heather Holloway?

27:31.350 --> 27:34.513
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Irish type.

27:34.620 --> 27:35.985
Brown hair, big blue eyes.

27:36.088 --> 27:37.180
Nice skin.

27:37.289 --> 27:38.313
Amazing tits.

27:38.424 --> 27:41.188
Tits? Why are tits relevant?

27:41.293 --> 27:42.624
Hmm, let's see.

27:42.728 --> 27:45.492
World-class tits on a reporter
interviewing a man

27:45.598 --> 27:48.431
with privileged information
are relevant.

27:48.534 --> 27:50.525
How about it, Nick?
Are you a tit man?

27:50.636 --> 27:52.433
Don't answer that.
That's a trap.

27:52.538 --> 27:55.336
Depends whose tits.

27:55.441 --> 27:57.238
Look, just don't get screwed,
all right?

27:57.343 --> 28:00.312
Bobby, I think I can handle
a good-looking girl reporter.

28:00.413 --> 28:02.040
Thank you.

28:11.257 --> 28:12.281
Heather Holloway.

28:12.391 --> 28:14.120
Nick Naylor, big tobacco.

28:15.828 --> 28:18.023
Is this kosher?

28:18.130 --> 28:20.064
Only if I can call you "Heather."

28:20.166 --> 28:22.430
By all means.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.037
So, Mr. Naylor...

28:26.138 --> 28:28.231
- Nick.
- Nick.

28:28.340 --> 28:30.365
Let's start with...

28:30.476 --> 28:31.807
An '82 Margaux.

28:31.911 --> 28:33.936
Okay. Is it good?

28:34.046 --> 28:37.482
Good? It'll make you believe in God.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.721
So what is the focus of your piece?

28:53.833 --> 28:55.664
- You.
- Really?

28:55.768 --> 28:57.599
You want to know how I live
with myself.

28:57.703 --> 29:01.434
No. I don't imagine
that's much of a problem.

29:01.540 --> 29:03.770
I want to know how you see yourself.

29:03.876 --> 29:05.070
I'm...

29:05.177 --> 29:07.941
a mediator between two sects
of society

29:08.047 --> 29:09.742
that are trying
to reach an accommodation.

29:09.849 --> 29:11.714
Interesting.

29:11.817 --> 29:15.480
My other interviews have pinned
you as a mass murderer,

29:15.588 --> 29:18.648
bloodsucker, pimp,
profiteer, child killer,

29:18.758 --> 29:22.023
and my personal favorite
"yuppie Mephistopheles."

29:22.128 --> 29:25.256
Wow, that sounds
like a balanced article.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.423
Who else should I talk to?

29:27.533 --> 29:29.660
55 million American smokers,
for starters

29:29.769 --> 29:32.636
or perhaps
the American tobacco farmer

29:32.738 --> 29:34.865
who is constantly being treated
like a drug smuggler.

29:34.974 --> 29:36.373
I actually do plan on speaking
to a tobacco farmer.

29:36.475 --> 29:37.475
Good.

29:37.576 --> 29:39.635
They're fine people,
salt of the earth.

29:39.745 --> 29:42.145
Nick, why do you do this?

29:42.248 --> 29:43.909
What motivates you?

29:50.422 --> 29:52.515
You really want to know?

29:52.625 --> 29:53.785
Mm-hmm.

29:53.893 --> 29:54.917
Really?

29:55.027 --> 29:56.824
Mm-hmm.

29:56.929 --> 30:01.559
Population control.

30:05.504 --> 30:06.596
You're bad.

30:09.041 --> 30:11.168
Everyone's got a mortgage to pay.

30:11.277 --> 30:13.507
<i>The yuppie Nuremberg defense.</i>

30:13.611 --> 30:17.138
So is a mortgage that much
of a life goal?

30:17.247 --> 30:21.547
Well, 99% of everything done
in the world, good or bad,

30:21.652 --> 30:24.177
is done to pay a mortgage,
so perhaps the world

30:24.288 --> 30:26.313
would be a better place
if everyone rented.

30:26.423 --> 30:28.516
Then why don't you rent?

30:28.626 --> 30:30.423
Mm. Well, I rent as well.

30:30.527 --> 30:31.994
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:32.096 --> 30:34.360
My son and his mother
and her boyfriend

30:34.465 --> 30:35.448
live in my house.

30:35.548 --> 30:36.658
I live in my apartment.

30:36.767 --> 30:40.259
What does Nick Naylor's
apartment look like?

30:40.371 --> 30:42.805
I don't know.
It's nothing impressive.

30:42.906 --> 30:44.271
It wouldn't make
the real estate section.

30:45.376 --> 30:47.139
Can I see it?

30:49.780 --> 30:51.509
You want to see my apartment?

30:51.615 --> 30:54.516
I'd like to see
where the devil sleeps.

31:00.824 --> 31:02.951
<i>I know what</i>
<i>you're probably thinking.</i>

31:05.529 --> 31:07.656
<i>This is a bad idea, right?</i>

31:10.401 --> 31:12.028
<i>I mean, come on.</i>

31:12.136 --> 31:13.228
<i>It's not that bad of an idea.</i>

31:27.885 --> 31:29.443
Mom, why can't I go

31:29.553 --> 31:31.612
to California?

31:31.722 --> 31:35.158
Because California's
just not a... safe place.

31:35.259 --> 31:37.784
And besides,
I'm not sure it's appropriate

31:37.895 --> 31:41.126
for your father to bring you
on a business trip.

31:41.231 --> 31:42.664
Appropriate for who?

31:42.766 --> 31:44.734
What?

31:44.835 --> 31:47.133
Mom, is it possible that
you're taking the frustration

31:47.237 --> 31:49.102
of your failed marriage out on me?

31:50.174 --> 31:52.642
Excuse me?

31:52.743 --> 31:55.007
This California trip seems like
a great learning opportunity

31:55.112 --> 31:57.910
and a chance for me
to get to know my father.

31:58.015 --> 31:59.744
But if you think it's more important

31:59.850 --> 32:01.715
to use me to channel your frustration

32:01.819 --> 32:03.719
against the man you no longer love,

32:03.821 --> 32:05.482
I'll understand.

32:10.527 --> 32:12.461
How'd you convince her?

32:12.563 --> 32:14.758
It was an argument,
not a negotiation.

32:14.865 --> 32:16.492
That's my boy.

33:02.813 --> 33:04.474
Nick?

33:04.581 --> 33:06.708
Nick, Jack, Jeff's assistant. Hey.

33:06.817 --> 33:09.081
How was your flight?
Are you jet-lagged at all?

33:09.186 --> 33:10.881
It's, like, 2:00 in D.C.
Right now.

33:10.988 --> 33:12.455
You know what?
Take some vitamin B.

33:12.556 --> 33:13.784
Jeff swears by it- in fact,

33:13.891 --> 33:15.552
I'm gonna hook you up
with an injection.

33:15.659 --> 33:17.058
Who's this with you?
How are you, dude? What's going on?

33:17.161 --> 33:18.253
You guys ever been to L.A. Before?

33:18.362 --> 33:20.193
You want to head back
to Jeffâ€™s office?

33:20.297 --> 33:22.663
In fact, we probably should-
He's a punctual being.

33:22.766 --> 33:25.599
We actually had some problems at first
with the exterior mirrored glass.

33:25.702 --> 33:28.262
The reflection of the sun was causing
head-on collisions on Wilshire.

33:28.372 --> 33:29.964
Oh, is everybody all right?

33:30.073 --> 33:32.234
Yeah, they got three-picture deals
at Paramount- I'm sure they'll live.

33:32.342 --> 33:33.570
- It's a nice building.
- Yeah?

33:33.677 --> 33:35.542
Hey, tell Jeff you think so, okay?

33:35.646 --> 33:38.171
'Cause he just put a lot
of himself into this building.

33:38.282 --> 33:41.718
And you know something?
It really shows.

33:41.819 --> 33:43.377
What's up, Hiroshi?

33:43.487 --> 33:47.253
Keep going- that sand's
not gonna rake itself.

33:47.357 --> 33:49.382
All right, come here,
this is my favorite part.

33:49.493 --> 33:52.724
That one right there?
It's $7,000.

33:52.830 --> 33:54.855
- $7,000 for a fish?
- Yep.

33:54.965 --> 33:56.865
Kind of makes you want
to stop eating sushi,

33:56.967 --> 33:58.594
but I guess you kind of have to.

33:58.702 --> 34:00.533
Hey, you see that
big white one right there?

34:00.637 --> 34:03.401
Swear to you- $12,000,
gift from Oprah.

34:03.507 --> 34:07.307
It's a Chamberlain- office-warming gift
from Matthew McConaughey.

34:07.411 --> 34:08.775
Generous gift.

34:08.879 --> 34:10.904
Yeah. Right!

34:11.014 --> 34:13.847
Don't get me wrong, Matthew is
a tremendously talented individual

34:13.951 --> 34:15.440
and an extremely decent human being,

34:15.552 --> 34:18.077
however, before Jeff
took him on, he was a face.

34:18.188 --> 34:19.416
Now he's a name.

34:23.060 --> 34:25.960
Do you hear that?

34:29.199 --> 34:30.530
No.

34:31.601 --> 34:33.831
Exactly.

34:42.713 --> 34:44.078
Hey, Neal.

34:44.181 --> 34:46.445
Neal, I'm gonna impale
your mom on a spike,

34:46.550 --> 34:49.212
and I'm gonna feed her dead body
to my dog with syphilis.

34:49.319 --> 34:51.081
Aw, Jack, you got me!

34:51.188 --> 34:52.849
That guy!

34:52.956 --> 34:55.652
It's an inside joke.

34:55.759 --> 34:58.023
So, as you can see,

34:58.128 --> 35:00.323
Jeff just really loves Asian shit.

35:00.430 --> 35:02.159
Uh, Candace, is he ready?

35:02.266 --> 35:03.927
- Mm-hmm.
- Fantastic.

35:04.034 --> 35:06.298
Okay, Joey,
I'm gonna bring your dad in now.

35:06.403 --> 35:08.428
Is there anything I can get
you while you're waiting,

35:08.538 --> 35:10.733
like an orange juice
or a coffee or a Red Bull?

35:10.841 --> 35:13.241
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

35:15.746 --> 35:17.714
Wow, it's a great office.

35:17.814 --> 35:19.805
Yeah. Jeff basically designed
the whole thing.

35:19.917 --> 35:21.817
The architect just made the drawings.

35:21.919 --> 35:24.285
Jack, stop it.

35:24.388 --> 35:25.685
Next you're gonna be telling him

35:25.789 --> 35:27.279
what position I played
for the Bruins.

35:27.391 --> 35:28.341
Quarterback.

35:28.441 --> 35:29.654
Jeff Megall.

35:29.760 --> 35:30.988
Nick Naylor.

35:31.094 --> 35:33.324
Mr. Naylor's here to see
if we can't get cigarettes

35:33.430 --> 35:35.955
- into the hands of somebody
other than the usual RAVs. - Sure.

35:36.066 --> 35:38.557
- RAVs?
- Russians, Arabs and Villains.

35:38.669 --> 35:40.398
Oh, well, then yes, I guess
that is why I'm here.

35:40.504 --> 35:42.699
Good. I think we can help.

35:42.806 --> 35:44.899
Jeff invented product placement.

35:45.008 --> 35:46.976
I feel I have to ask, uh...

35:47.077 --> 35:50.069
Are you concerned at
all about the, um...

35:50.180 --> 35:51.738
about the health element?

35:51.848 --> 35:54.715
I'm not a doctor, I'm a facilitator.

35:54.818 --> 35:56.080
I bring creative people together.

35:56.186 --> 35:58.381
Whatever information there is,
exists, it's out there.

35:58.488 --> 35:59.682
People will decide for themselves.

35:59.790 --> 36:02.224
They should. It's not
my role to decide for them.

36:02.326 --> 36:04.226
It'd be morally presumptuous.

36:04.328 --> 36:06.888
<i>I could learn a lot</i>
<i>from this man.</i>

36:06.997 --> 36:09.363
Now, what we need is
a smoking role model,

36:09.466 --> 36:10.433
a real winner.

36:10.533 --> 36:12.195
Indiana Jones meets Jerry Maguire.

36:12.302 --> 36:13.360
Right, on two packs a day.

36:13.470 --> 36:15.495
Only he can't live
in contemporary society.

36:15.605 --> 36:16.555
Why not?

36:16.655 --> 36:18.597
The health issue's way too prevalent.

36:18.709 --> 36:20.643
People would constantly
be asking the character

36:20.744 --> 36:23.008
why he's smoking-
and that should go unsaid.

36:23.113 --> 36:25.047
How do you feel about the future?

36:25.148 --> 36:27.343
The future?

36:27.451 --> 36:29.180
Yeah, after the health thing's
blown over.

36:29.286 --> 36:30.617
A world
where smokers and nonsmokers

36:30.721 --> 36:32.120
live together in perfect harmony.

36:32.222 --> 36:34.588
Sony has a futuristic sci-fi movie
they're looking to make.

36:34.691 --> 36:36.625
<i>Message From Sector Six.</i>

36:36.727 --> 36:38.752
All takes place in a space station.

36:38.862 --> 36:40.727
They're actively looking
for some cofinancing.

36:40.831 --> 36:42.298
So cigarettes in space?

36:42.399 --> 36:44.526
It's the final frontier, Nick.

36:44.634 --> 36:46.625
But wouldn't they blow up
in an all-oxygen environment?

36:47.704 --> 36:49.433
Probably.

36:49.539 --> 36:52.133
But it's an easy fix-
one line of dialogue:

36:52.242 --> 36:54.210
"Thank God we invented the..."
you know,

36:54.311 --> 36:55.608
whatever device.

36:55.712 --> 36:57.577
Brad Pitt.

36:57.681 --> 36:59.239
Catherine Zeta-Jones.

36:59.349 --> 37:00.748
They've just finished ravishing

37:00.851 --> 37:03.445
each other's bodies
for the first time.

37:03.553 --> 37:05.578
They lie naked, suspended in air

37:05.689 --> 37:07.122
underneath the heavens.

37:07.224 --> 37:09.590
Pitt lights up.

37:09.693 --> 37:11.422
He starts blowing smoke rings
all around

37:11.528 --> 37:13.325
Catherine's naked, flawless body,

37:13.430 --> 37:16.593
as the galaxies go whizzing
by over the glass-domed ceiling.

37:16.700 --> 37:18.759
Now, tell me that
doesn't work for you.

37:18.869 --> 37:20.166
I'd see that movie.

37:20.270 --> 37:21.532
I'd buy the goddamn DVD.

37:21.638 --> 37:24.334
You know, if the academy
didn't send them to me for free.

37:24.441 --> 37:25.908
You know,

37:26.009 --> 37:28.170
you guys ought to think
about designing a cigarette

37:28.278 --> 37:30.007
to be released simultaneously
with the movie.

37:30.113 --> 37:31.671
Sector Sixes.

37:31.782 --> 37:33.340
No one's ever done it
with a cigarette.

37:33.450 --> 37:34.576
Wow.

37:34.684 --> 37:36.584
Well, where do we go from here?

37:36.686 --> 37:39.519
You enjoy the rest of your day
in L.A. With your son

37:39.623 --> 37:41.557
while I find out
the answers to these questions.

37:41.658 --> 37:44.286
Hey, where can I get
a bite to eat with my son?

37:44.394 --> 37:45.918
You ought to try Nobu's new place.

37:46.029 --> 37:48.429
- He only serves food that's white.
- Oh, great.

37:49.699 --> 37:51.929
<i>So, you go to an office,</i>

37:52.035 --> 37:54.663
<i>then you go on TV</i>
<i>and talk about cigarettes.</i>

37:54.771 --> 37:56.602
<i>Then you fly out to L.A.</i>

37:56.706 --> 37:59.174
To talk to some guy who
works with movie stars.

37:59.276 --> 38:02.575
- What is that?
- That's my job; I'm a lobbyist.

38:02.679 --> 38:05.341
I know, but did you study to do that?

38:05.449 --> 38:07.940
No. No, I just kind of figured it out.

38:08.051 --> 38:10.144
Then can't anyone just do that?

38:10.253 --> 38:14.189
No, it, uh, requires a...

38:14.291 --> 38:18.022
a moral flexibility
that goes beyond most people.

38:19.129 --> 38:21.962
Do I have flexible morals?

38:22.065 --> 38:24.761
Well, let's say
you became a lawyer, right?

38:24.868 --> 38:26.495
And you were asked
to defend a murderer.

38:26.603 --> 38:28.127
Worse than that- a child murderer.

38:28.238 --> 38:29.535
Now,

38:29.639 --> 38:32.631
the law states that every person
deserves a fair trial.

38:32.742 --> 38:34.835
Would you defend them?

38:34.945 --> 38:36.640
I don't know.
I guess every person

38:36.746 --> 38:38.577
- deserves a fair defense.
- Yeah, well,

38:38.682 --> 38:40.809
so do multinational corporations.

38:40.917 --> 38:44.216
So, what happens when you're wrong?

38:44.321 --> 38:45.982
Well, Joey, I'm never wrong.

38:46.089 --> 38:47.556
But you can't always be right.

38:47.657 --> 38:50.592
Well, if it's your job to be right,
then you're never wrong.

38:50.694 --> 38:52.889
<i>But what if you are wrong?</i>

38:52.996 --> 38:55.157
Okay, let's say that
you're defending chocolate

38:55.265 --> 38:56.596
and I'm defending vanilla.

38:56.700 --> 38:59.100
Now, if I were to say to you,

38:59.202 --> 39:02.103
"Vanilla's the best flavor
ice cream," you'd say?

39:02.205 --> 39:04.264
- "No, chocolate is."
- Exactly.

39:04.374 --> 39:05.966
But you can't win that argument.

39:06.076 --> 39:08.636
So, I'll ask you-
So you think chocolate

39:08.745 --> 39:11.543
is the end-all and be-all
of ice cream, do you?

39:11.648 --> 39:13.707
It's the best ice cream;
I wouldn't order any other.

39:13.817 --> 39:15.717
Oh. So it's all chocolate
for you, is it?

39:15.819 --> 39:17.411
Yes, chocolate is all I need.

39:17.521 --> 39:18.818
Well, I need more than chocolate.

39:18.922 --> 39:20.913
And for that matter,
I need more than vanilla.

39:21.024 --> 39:22.787
I believe that we need
freedom and choice

39:22.893 --> 39:25.384
when it comes to our ice cream,
and that, Joey Naylor,

39:25.495 --> 39:27.019
that is the definition of liberty.

39:27.130 --> 39:29.064
But that's not what
we're talking about.

39:29.166 --> 39:31.566
<i>Ah, but that's what</i>
<i>I'm talking about.</i>

39:31.668 --> 39:34.603
- But... you didn't prove that vanilla's the best.
- I didn't have to.

39:34.704 --> 39:37.537
I proved that you're wrong-
and if you're wrong, I'm right.

39:37.641 --> 39:38.624
But you still didn't

39:38.724 --> 39:39.766
convince me.

39:39.876 --> 39:41.207
'Cause I'm not after you.

39:41.311 --> 39:44.610
I'm after them.

40:00.697 --> 40:02.164
Hello?

40:02.265 --> 40:04.165
Thought I'd give you a little update.

40:04.267 --> 40:06.235
Jeff. You still at the office?

40:06.336 --> 40:08.861
Do you know what time it is
in Tokyo right now?

40:08.972 --> 40:10.735
- No.
- 4:00 p.m. Tomorrow.

40:10.840 --> 40:12.637
It's the future, Nick.

40:13.843 --> 40:15.572
Anyway, for Pitt to smoke,

40:15.679 --> 40:17.909
it's $10 million;
for the pair, it's 25.

40:18.014 --> 40:21.177
25?! Usually when I buy two
of something, I get a discount.

40:21.284 --> 40:22.478
What's the extra five for?

40:22.586 --> 40:23.746
Synergy.

40:23.853 --> 40:26.617
These are not stupid people;
they got it right away.

40:26.723 --> 40:28.953
Pitt and Zeta-Jones lighting up
after some cosmic fucking

40:29.059 --> 40:31.527
in the bubble suite's
gonna sell a lot of cigarettes.

40:31.628 --> 40:33.061
Well, for that kind of money,

40:33.163 --> 40:35.063
my people will expect
some very serious smoking.

40:35.165 --> 40:36.655
Can Brad blow smoke rings?

40:36.766 --> 40:38.165
I don't have that information.

40:38.268 --> 40:39.963
Well, for $25 million,
we'd want smoke rings.

40:40.070 --> 40:41.560
Oh, one other thing-
you'll be cofinancing

40:41.671 --> 40:43.605
the picture
with the Sultan of Glutan.

40:43.707 --> 40:44.901
The Sultan of Glutan?

40:45.008 --> 40:47.033
The one who massacred
and enslaved his own people?

40:47.143 --> 40:49.634
Aren't they calling him
the Hitler of the South Pacific?

40:49.746 --> 40:52.180
No, I can't speak to that-
All my dealings with him,

40:52.282 --> 40:54.011
he's been a very reasonable
and sensitive guy.

40:54.117 --> 40:55.345
He's fun. You'll like him.

40:55.452 --> 40:56.646
I better run it by my people.

40:56.753 --> 40:57.845
No problem.

40:57.954 --> 40:59.319
Oh, that's London calling.

40:59.422 --> 41:01.549
7:00 a.m. In the Old Empire.

41:01.658 --> 41:03.216
Jeff, when do you sleep?

41:03.326 --> 41:04.554
Sunday.

42:06.690 --> 42:09.181
- Operator.
- Yeah, my light is blinking.

42:09.292 --> 42:12.523
- There's a package downstairs for you.
- Okay, send it up.

42:15.065 --> 42:18.262
Captain, I'm sitting in front
of an open briefcase.

42:18.368 --> 42:20.393
I don't suppose this is a raise.

42:20.503 --> 42:24.303
Now, Nick, do you know
who Lorne Lutch is?

42:24.407 --> 42:26.102
Yeah, of course.
He's the original Marlboro Man.

42:26.209 --> 42:28.677
<i>He's dying.</i>
<i>He was on Sally last week.</i>

42:28.778 --> 42:30.973
Not exactly our biggest fan.

42:31.081 --> 42:32.309
Well, the money's for him.

42:32.415 --> 42:35.043
Now, he has a ranch
out there in California.

42:35.151 --> 42:36.812
I want you to bring it to him.

42:36.920 --> 42:40.754
He's a cowboy, sir,
and cowboys don't like bribes.

42:40.857 --> 42:43.018
It's not a bribe. No, sir.

42:43.126 --> 42:45.890
You're going out there
on wings of angels, son.

42:45.995 --> 42:48.930
You mean we're just going
to give him the money?

42:49.032 --> 42:50.431
Well, I think Christ himself
would say,

42:50.533 --> 42:52.763
"That's mighty white of you boys."

42:52.869 --> 42:54.928
No gag agreement?

42:55.038 --> 42:57.438
Hopefully, he'll be so damn
overcome with gratitude

42:57.540 --> 42:59.872
<i>he'll... he'll have to shut up.</i>

43:10.620 --> 43:12.952
Hey, kiddo, I got to go do
a little bit more work

43:13.056 --> 43:14.148
this afternoon, all right?

43:14.257 --> 43:15.207
Can I come?

43:15.307 --> 43:16.691
No. Not this time.

43:16.793 --> 43:18.954
But I want to see what you do.

44:00.270 --> 44:01.862
You stay here, okay?

44:21.024 --> 44:23.584
What the fuck are you doing here?

44:23.693 --> 44:26.287
Uh... uh...

44:26.396 --> 44:28.091
Do you have a minute?

44:33.236 --> 44:34.897
What do you want?

44:35.004 --> 44:36.232
Dad!

44:36.339 --> 44:37.465
Joey, get back in the car.

44:44.080 --> 44:46.071
Just want to talk.

44:47.417 --> 44:49.476
All right.

44:49.586 --> 44:51.053
Let's talk.

45:07.470 --> 45:09.904
Pearl, we got company.

45:12.542 --> 45:15.739
Mister, you got a lot of nerve
walking in here after...

45:15.845 --> 45:19.212
Honey, why don't you show
this young man some iced tea?

45:22.352 --> 45:23.842
I'll be right back, tiger.

45:40.270 --> 45:42.830
Saw you on...

45:42.939 --> 45:46.431
Weren't you on that TV show?

45:46.543 --> 45:49.341
Yeah. Yeah, that was me.

45:49.445 --> 45:53.006
You're lucky you made it
out of there alive.

45:53.116 --> 45:55.414
Yeah. Tobacco used to be
all over the television.

45:55.518 --> 45:59.511
Now TV is leading the witch hunt.

45:59.622 --> 46:01.487
Strange business.

46:01.591 --> 46:04.492
Last year, after I was diagnosed,

46:04.594 --> 46:10.123
flew east to attend the
annual stockholders' convention.

46:11.901 --> 46:13.869
Stood up and told them
I thought

46:13.970 --> 46:18.600
they ought to cut back
on their advertising.

46:18.708 --> 46:21.302
You know what your boss said to me?

46:24.547 --> 46:27.607
He said, "We're certainly sorry

46:27.717 --> 46:31.483
"to hear about your medical problem.

46:31.588 --> 46:35.024
"However, without
knowing more

46:35.124 --> 46:38.787
"of your medical history,

46:38.895 --> 46:40.988
we can't comment further."

46:43.566 --> 46:45.796
But then they tried to pretend

46:45.902 --> 46:47.631
I never worked for 'em.

46:49.572 --> 46:51.802
Yeah, I got the pay stubs.

46:51.908 --> 46:54.672
But, hell,
I was on the damn billboards.

46:56.412 --> 46:58.141
I never
even smoked

46:58.247 --> 47:00.272
Marlboro.

47:00.383 --> 47:02.851
I smoked Kools.

47:07.256 --> 47:10.384
You look like a nice-enough fella.

47:10.493 --> 47:12.791
What are you doing
working for these assholes?

47:14.697 --> 47:16.756
I'm good at it.

47:16.866 --> 47:18.094
Better at doing this

47:18.201 --> 47:19.862
than I ever was
at doing anything else.

47:19.969 --> 47:21.903
Aw, hell, son.

47:22.005 --> 47:24.565
I was good at shooting VC.

47:24.674 --> 47:26.642
I didn't make it my career.

47:28.945 --> 47:32.608
I suppose we all
got to pay the mortgage.

47:36.452 --> 47:38.613
Your dad always bring
you along like this?

47:38.721 --> 47:41.451
No. I live with my mom.

47:41.557 --> 47:43.286
He tell you why he's here today?

47:43.393 --> 47:47.227
He said that your husband
was the Marlboro Man.

47:48.831 --> 47:52.631
Yeah, well, not anymore.

47:52.735 --> 47:54.202
Hello.

47:54.303 --> 47:56.464
Yeah. Hey, can you hold on a second?

47:56.572 --> 48:00.668
You need anything else,
grab it out of the fridge.

48:00.777 --> 48:02.438
So I'm standing here
minding my own business,

48:02.545 --> 48:04.410
filling up pill bottles...

48:04.514 --> 48:10.419
So you're here to talk me
into shutting up?

48:12.288 --> 48:14.552
That what's in that case of yours?

48:14.657 --> 48:17.319
Yeah, basically.

48:18.528 --> 48:19.927
No, not basically.

48:20.029 --> 48:22.259
That's... that's exactly it.

48:24.367 --> 48:25.994
My dignity ain't for sale.

48:26.102 --> 48:28.570
It's not an offer.
It's a gift.

48:28.671 --> 48:29.797
Taxes have all been paid.

48:29.906 --> 48:32.636
You get to keep it
no matter what you do.

48:32.742 --> 48:34.175
The idea is that, somehow,

48:34.277 --> 48:36.905
your guilt will prevent you
from bad-mouthing us.

48:37.013 --> 48:38.810
Are you supposed to be

48:38.915 --> 48:40.610
telling me all that?

48:40.717 --> 48:43.242
No, sir. Just apologize,

48:43.352 --> 48:45.115
give you the money, and leave.

48:45.221 --> 48:46.984
<i>Why are you telling me this?</i>

48:49.525 --> 48:51.493
Because, this way,
you'll take the money.

48:51.594 --> 48:52.856
Why would I do that?

48:52.962 --> 48:53.962
Because you're mad.

48:54.063 --> 48:55.496
Damn straight I am.

48:55.598 --> 48:56.598
The first thing you'll do,

48:56.699 --> 48:58.792
<i>is you'll call the L.A. Times,</i>
<i>and CNN...</i>

48:58.901 --> 49:00.300
- Huh?
- And insist on Bonnie Carlton.

49:00.403 --> 49:01.353
She does really good

49:01.453 --> 49:02.354
controlled outrage.

49:02.454 --> 49:03.633
Tell them, "No Bonnie, no story."

49:03.740 --> 49:04.764
Watch it on MSNBC.

49:04.874 --> 49:06.171
- Okay.
- When they get here,

49:06.275 --> 49:09.210
you open up the case...

49:11.914 --> 49:15.077
and you pour all the cash
out onto the floor.

49:15.184 --> 49:16.242
- Why?
- Trust me.

49:16.352 --> 49:17.546
It'll look more effective that way.

49:17.653 --> 49:21.714
Don't forget to shake
every last bundle out.

49:23.459 --> 49:25.120
If you can, you know,
give a cough or two.

49:25.228 --> 49:28.129
Once it's all
out on the floor,

49:28.231 --> 49:29.698
tell them what you're
going to do with it.

49:29.799 --> 49:30.783
<i>What am I going to do with it?</i>

49:30.883 --> 49:31.891
You're going to donate it.

49:32.001 --> 49:34.196
Yeah. Start the Lorne Lutch
Cancer Foundation.

49:34.303 --> 49:35.634
You're going to have
a ranch and a fair

49:35.738 --> 49:38.366
and a 5K.
A 5K is a must. Television...

49:38.474 --> 49:39.498
Wait a minute.

49:39.609 --> 49:41.839
What about my family?

49:44.280 --> 49:46.475
But, Lorne, you can't keep the money.

49:46.582 --> 49:48.072
Why the hell not?

49:48.184 --> 49:49.412
What do you mean?

49:49.519 --> 49:52.113
Denounce us,
and then keep the blood money?

49:52.221 --> 49:53.518
I mean, look at it.

50:00.797 --> 50:01.747
I got to think this over.

50:01.847 --> 50:02.732
Lorne, whoa.

50:02.832 --> 50:04.756
News doesn't work that way.

50:04.867 --> 50:06.892
You can't denounce us next week.

50:13.509 --> 50:16.774
I don't suppose I can
denounce you for half of it.

50:16.879 --> 50:20.246
No, Lorne. Either you keep
all the money,

50:20.349 --> 50:23.113
or you... you give it all away.

50:33.563 --> 50:35.724
Dad, how did you know

50:35.832 --> 50:37.697
he would take the money?

50:40.036 --> 50:42.937
You'd have to be crazy
to turn down all that money.

50:43.039 --> 50:45.507
When I saw he wasn't crazy,
I knew he'd take it.

50:47.009 --> 50:49.477
Would you have taken it?

50:49.579 --> 50:52.139
If I were him? Sure.

50:54.884 --> 50:56.351
So would I.

51:07.897 --> 51:08.955
I don't think you understand, sir.

51:09.065 --> 51:10.362
He's like a wild animal.

51:10.466 --> 51:12.127
You'll have to be
on your guard at all times.

51:12.235 --> 51:13.235
He has this trick.

51:13.336 --> 51:14.530
Ron, shut up.

51:14.637 --> 51:16.468
I've tangoed with presidents,
lawyers and Indian chiefs.

51:16.572 --> 51:19.132
I think I can handle Mr. Nick Naylor.

51:21.110 --> 51:22.304
All right, welcome back, kids.

51:22.411 --> 51:24.311
We've got two guests
on the show tonight.

51:24.413 --> 51:26.404
First, joining us
from our Washington studio...

51:26.515 --> 51:28.449
I must have that tie clip!

51:28.551 --> 51:31.145
...is the senator from
the great state of Vermont.

51:31.254 --> 51:33.415
Please welcome Ortolan Finistirre.

51:33.522 --> 51:34.472
Welcome, Senator.

51:34.572 --> 51:36.081
Good to be here, Dennis.

51:36.192 --> 51:37.887
And, joining us here
in our Los Angeles studio,

51:37.994 --> 51:39.859
he is the chief spokesperson

51:39.962 --> 51:42.157
for the Academy of Tobacco Studies.

51:42.265 --> 51:43.755
Quite an august chamber, might I add?

51:43.866 --> 51:45.629
- Nick Naylor. Nick, welcome.
- Pleasure to be here.

51:45.735 --> 51:48.465
All right, I understand you were
on Joan Lunden's show recently.

51:48.571 --> 51:50.163
Didn't make a lot
of friends over there, did you?

51:50.273 --> 51:51.638
I will say that I don't think

51:51.741 --> 51:53.038
I'll be getting
my annual invitation

51:53.142 --> 51:55.906
to the Finistirre Labor Day Barbecue.

51:56.012 --> 51:58.412
Well, I continue to offer
an open invitation to Mr. Naylor

51:58.514 --> 52:00.846
to join us in Congress
to talk about the inclusion

52:00.950 --> 52:03.680
of our new poison label which,
if I might say...

52:03.786 --> 52:05.947
Nick, ready to trek up
the Hill and testify

52:06.055 --> 52:07.249
before Congress?

52:07.356 --> 52:09.517
Well, I'd love to, Dennis,
but not as long as the senator

52:09.625 --> 52:10.990
is calling for me to be fired.

52:11.093 --> 52:13.391
It's not exactly
a welcome invitation.

52:13.496 --> 52:16.021
Yeah. Bit of a mixed message,
Senator.

52:16.132 --> 52:18.396
Well, not as mixed as the stance
that Big Tobacco has taken

52:18.501 --> 52:20.264
about the dangers
of smoking cigarettes.

52:20.369 --> 52:21.802
- Oh, no.
- Now what are you laughing?

52:21.904 --> 52:23.997
You're a wind-up artist.
Give the man his due.

52:24.106 --> 52:25.903
He's got a bit of a point there,
doesn't he?

52:26.008 --> 52:27.873
Sorry. I just can't
help myself, Dennis.

52:27.977 --> 52:29.638
I... I... I'm just tickled by the idea

52:29.745 --> 52:31.440
of the gentleman from Vermont

52:31.547 --> 52:34.107
calling me a hypocrite
when, uh... this same man,

52:34.216 --> 52:36.081
in one day, held a press
conference where he called

52:36.185 --> 52:38.676
for the American tobacco fields
to be slashed and burned,

52:38.788 --> 52:40.380
then he jumped on a private jet

52:40.489 --> 52:42.980
and flew down to Farm Aid
where he rode a tractor on stage

52:43.092 --> 52:46.084
- Oh, come on. - As he bemoaned
the downfall of the American farmer.

52:46.195 --> 52:47.992
Care to comment, Senator?

52:48.097 --> 52:50.031
He... I... No.

52:50.132 --> 52:52.362
Eloquent in its brevity.

52:52.468 --> 52:53.594
Emotional issue.

52:53.703 --> 52:54.931
Let's take some phone calls now.

52:55.037 --> 52:57.335
Herndon, Virginia.
Go ahead. You're on the show.

52:57.440 --> 52:59.931
Dennis, has anyone ever
announced that they're going

53:00.042 --> 53:01.805
to kill someone live on your show?

53:01.911 --> 53:05.142
My demo's been called quirky
but, no, at this point,

53:05.247 --> 53:07.340
we're not skewing
to the emotionally unstable.

53:07.450 --> 53:09.577
Then it's your lucky day.

53:09.685 --> 53:11.346
Because I'm here to tell
you that, within a week,

53:11.454 --> 53:14.048
we're going to dispatch
Mr. Naylor from this planet

53:14.156 --> 53:17.853
for all the pain and suffering
he's caused in the world.

53:21.630 --> 53:24.121
As I said, emotional issue.
We're going to break now.

53:24.233 --> 53:25.996
I got to fire a call screener.

53:52.928 --> 53:54.395
Let's go.

54:30.066 --> 54:32.728
This is Nick Naylor
telling you kids,

54:32.835 --> 54:36.032
"Don't do drugs, smoke cigarettes."

54:36.138 --> 54:37.298
That's really great.

54:37.406 --> 54:39.033
It's like I'm looking in a mirror.

54:39.141 --> 54:41.268
New idea:

54:41.377 --> 54:43.743
Cigarettes for the homeless.

54:43.846 --> 54:44.938
We'll call them "hobos."

54:46.482 --> 54:47.847
Uh, that's awful.

54:47.950 --> 54:49.474
Any better than "Sector Sixes"?

54:49.585 --> 54:51.553
Right.

54:51.654 --> 54:54.487
Oh, my God, Nick, you're on TV.

54:55.658 --> 54:58.286
"Lobbyist on the lookout."

54:58.394 --> 55:01.591
You got to be kidding me.

55:02.865 --> 55:06.562
I want to fuck you
while I watch you on TV.

55:06.669 --> 55:08.398
And they call me sick.

55:08.504 --> 55:09.454
Hurry.

55:09.554 --> 55:11.496
Before your segment ends.

55:11.607 --> 55:13.541
All right.

55:19.315 --> 55:21.442
Tell me more about Los Angeles, baby.

55:21.550 --> 55:22.710
Huh?

55:26.922 --> 55:28.719
<i>He says he wants</i>
<i>to trail me everywhere,</i>

55:28.824 --> 55:29.984
I said, "Who's paying for it?"

55:30.092 --> 55:31.582
He says the tobacco company's
paying for it.

55:31.694 --> 55:33.218
I said, "I don't need a bodyguard."

55:33.329 --> 55:34.887
I'm a man of the people.

55:34.997 --> 55:36.862
Rock on, Kennedy.

55:36.966 --> 55:38.661
Listen, we're all going to
need bodyguards soon enough.

55:38.767 --> 55:40.564
Did you see the coverage
the fatal alcohol people

55:40.669 --> 55:41.727
got themselves over this weekend?

55:41.837 --> 55:43.668
They made it seem like
we were encouraging

55:43.772 --> 55:44.898
pregnant women to drink.

55:45.007 --> 55:46.099
I'm surprised I didn't get kidnapped

55:46.208 --> 55:47.539
on my way to work this morning.

55:47.643 --> 55:51.135
I don't think people from
the alcoholic beverage industry

55:51.247 --> 55:53.238
need to worry about
being kidnapped just yet.

55:54.850 --> 55:56.442
Pardon me?

55:56.552 --> 55:57.849
Look, I mean,

55:57.953 --> 55:59.944
nothing personal,
but tobacco generates

56:00.055 --> 56:02.285
a little more heat than alcohol.

56:02.391 --> 56:03.858
Oh, this is news.

56:03.959 --> 56:07.588
My product puts away 475,000 a year.

56:07.696 --> 56:10.358
Oh, okay, now 475 is a legit number.

56:10.466 --> 56:11.694
Okay, 435,000.

56:11.800 --> 56:12.858
That's 1,200 a day.

56:12.968 --> 56:14.299
How many alcohol-related deaths
a year?

56:14.403 --> 56:16.530
- Well, does that...
- 100,000 tops?

56:16.639 --> 56:20.268
That's, what, 270 a day?

56:20.376 --> 56:21.536
Wowee.

56:21.644 --> 56:24.010
270 people, a tragedy.

56:24.113 --> 56:26.104
Excuse me if I don't exactly see
terrorists getting excited

56:26.215 --> 56:27.842
about kidnapping anyone
from the alcohol industry.

56:27.950 --> 56:29.212
- Well, you haven't even
- Okay,

56:29.318 --> 56:31.149
- taken into account the number of deaths
- let's just

56:31.253 --> 56:33.949
- breathe.
- How many gun deaths a year in the U. S?

56:34.056 --> 56:35.785
11,000.

56:35.891 --> 56:38.223
11,000, are you kidding me?

56:38.327 --> 56:40.261
30 a day.

56:40.362 --> 56:41.795
That's less than passenger car
mortalities.

56:41.897 --> 56:43.489
No terrorist would bother
with either of you.

56:57.179 --> 56:58.942
Okay, look...
stupid argument.

56:59.048 --> 57:01.073
I'll say.

57:01.183 --> 57:04.152
I'm sure both of you warrant
vigilante justice.

57:04.253 --> 57:06.016
Thank you.

57:26.875 --> 57:28.137
Hey... please.
Stop... hey.

57:28.244 --> 57:29.336
Who are you guys?

57:33.249 --> 57:35.547
<i>And freedom means</i>
<i>that we can do what we want.</i>

57:35.651 --> 57:38.017
And that's really important.

57:38.120 --> 57:41.715
Because otherwise,
we couldn't be free.

57:41.824 --> 57:45.851
And that's why America is
the best government in the world.

57:45.961 --> 57:47.519
Whoa, hey, hey, hey.

57:47.630 --> 57:50.326
Hey, no need for that,
no need for that.

57:50.432 --> 57:51.797
Whoa, whoa, hey.

57:51.900 --> 57:52.884
Hey, wait.

57:52.984 --> 57:54.162
Can we get a dialogue going here?

57:54.270 --> 57:57.034
Nick, we want you
to stop killing people.

57:57.139 --> 57:58.868
So many people.

57:58.974 --> 58:00.532
Half a million people a year
in the U.S.

58:00.643 --> 58:02.338
That, there's no data
to support that.

58:02.444 --> 58:04.571
Nick... you're not on TV anymore.

58:07.983 --> 58:09.678
Okay, Joey, it's your turn.

58:12.288 --> 58:13.550
Hey!

58:13.656 --> 58:15.055
Nick, how much do you smoke a day?

58:15.157 --> 58:16.715
Hey, what are you doing?

58:16.825 --> 58:19.089
According to the box,
each one of those patches

58:19.194 --> 58:21.355
contains 21 milligrams of nicotine.

58:21.463 --> 58:22.447
That's, like, what?

58:22.547 --> 58:23.930
One pack?

58:24.033 --> 58:26.331
Our industry has been working
hand in hand with...

58:26.435 --> 58:28.369
Nick! Just listen, all right?

58:28.470 --> 58:30.028
What makes America
the best government?

58:30.139 --> 58:32.437
The passion that doesn't exist
anywhere in the world.

58:32.541 --> 58:34.441
Says here there are
many adverse reactions

58:34.543 --> 58:35.601
from those things.

58:35.711 --> 58:37.611
Let's see, "arrhythmia,

58:37.713 --> 58:39.180
"constipation, dyspepsia,

58:39.281 --> 58:41.806
- "nausea...
- My industry does $48 billion in revenue.

58:41.917 --> 58:43.612
Pharyngitis, sinusitis..."

58:43.719 --> 58:46.552
Sure you can call it capitalism,
a free market,

58:46.655 --> 58:48.282
a celebration of tariff breakdowns...

58:48.390 --> 58:51.052
"dysmenorrhea..."

58:51.160 --> 58:53.128
I don't even want to know
what that means.

58:53.228 --> 58:54.991
Hey, look, I guess you could
start by, you know,

58:55.097 --> 58:56.894
asking for five million,
working your way up from there.

58:56.999 --> 58:58.432
But I don't want any money, Nick.

58:58.534 --> 58:59.501
Well, what do you want?

58:59.601 --> 59:00.865
I mean, I'm all ears here.

59:00.969 --> 59:04.097
I have another word for it-

59:04.206 --> 59:05.434
love.

59:05.541 --> 59:07.168
What does any man want?

59:07.276 --> 59:08.834
The love of a woman,

59:08.944 --> 59:10.138
crisp bacon...

59:10.245 --> 59:15.114
an average life span over 80 years.

59:15.217 --> 59:17.583
Oh, Nick...

59:19.755 --> 59:21.814
...you don't look so good.

59:28.831 --> 59:30.594
<i>If you should smell smoke,</i>

59:30.699 --> 59:33.167
<i>please dial zero for the operator.</i>

59:33.268 --> 59:37.398
<i>Before leaving the room,</i>
<i>check the door for heat.</i>

59:37.506 --> 59:40.168

59:59.461 --> 01:00:01.759
<i>There are still</i>

01:00:01.864 --> 01:00:04.594
<i>that link smoking to emphysema.</i>

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:13.165
You woke up.

01:00:13.275 --> 01:00:15.436

01:00:15.544 --> 01:00:19.207
<i>Is she implying that I</i>

01:00:30.426 --> 01:00:31.620
I was so scared.

01:00:31.727 --> 01:00:32.989
Hey, Joey.

01:00:34.596 --> 01:00:35.858
What happened?

01:00:35.964 --> 01:00:38.694
No nonsmoker
could've ever withstood

01:00:38.801 --> 01:00:40.792
the amount of nicotine
you had in your bloodstream.

01:00:40.903 --> 01:00:42.871
Hate to say it, but...

01:00:42.971 --> 01:00:45.531
cigarettes saved your life.

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:49.334
Can I quote you on that, doc?

01:00:49.445 --> 01:00:51.709
You're a real trooper, my boy.

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:53.645
Hey, Captain,

01:00:53.749 --> 01:00:55.080
where are you?

01:00:55.184 --> 01:00:56.913
Winston-Salem General.

01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:00.854
Damn heart failing me again.

01:01:00.956 --> 01:01:02.685
I thought we could be roommates.

01:01:02.791 --> 01:01:04.019
Nick, before
we get sidetracked,

01:01:04.126 --> 01:01:05.821
there is one thing.

01:01:05.928 --> 01:01:08.419
All right, don't get
all dramatic on me, doc.

01:01:08.530 --> 01:01:10.555
You can't smoke.

01:01:14.336 --> 01:01:15.394
That's no problem.

01:01:15.504 --> 01:01:17.028
I've quit before.

01:01:17.139 --> 01:01:19.039
I did during the pregnancy.

01:01:19.141 --> 01:01:20.199
How long, you think?

01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:22.368
I don't think you understand.

01:01:22.478 --> 01:01:25.038
It's a miracle you came
out of this alive.

01:01:25.147 --> 01:01:26.739
Any smoking- one cigarette-

01:01:26.849 --> 01:01:28.942
could put you right back
into a paralytic state.

01:01:29.051 --> 01:01:31.645
Your body just can't handle it.

01:01:36.959 --> 01:01:38.950
Nick, I don't want to put
any more pressure on you,

01:01:39.061 --> 01:01:40.892
but we got a camera crew
waiting out there.

01:01:40.996 --> 01:01:43.021
If we want to make
the evening news...

01:01:43.131 --> 01:01:45.691
You want to unhook me here?

01:01:45.801 --> 01:01:49.703
This just goes to prove what
I've been saying for so long.

01:01:49.805 --> 01:01:53.935
These nicotine patches
are just deadly.

01:01:54.042 --> 01:01:55.805
Smoking saved my life.

01:01:55.911 --> 01:01:58.505
Considering your condition,
will you still be able to appear

01:01:58.614 --> 01:02:00.673
before Senator Finistirre's
subcommittee hearing

01:02:00.782 --> 01:02:02.807
on the usage of poison labels
on cigarette packaging?

01:02:02.918 --> 01:02:04.510
Oh, I think now more than ever

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:06.451
it is imperative that I be there.

01:02:06.555 --> 01:02:08.580
Nothing will keep me from testifying.

01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:11.750
Fucking kidnapping.

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:13.259
I don't understand, sir.

01:02:13.362 --> 01:02:16.627
Aren't we considering
the kidnapping a good thing?

01:02:16.732 --> 01:02:18.393
Well, he didn't die.

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.832
He was almost killed, sir.

01:02:20.936 --> 01:02:22.096
That's the point.

01:02:22.204 --> 01:02:24.297
Now he looks like a victim,
lucky bastard.

01:02:26.208 --> 01:02:28.335
The way I heard it,
D.C. Police found you naked

01:02:28.443 --> 01:02:30.104
laying in Lincoln's crotch

01:02:30.212 --> 01:02:33.909
<i>covered in nicotine patches</i>
<i>with a sign across your chest</i>

01:02:34.016 --> 01:02:36.507
- that said...
- He doesn't need to hear the details.

01:02:36.618 --> 01:02:38.950
It was some pretty fucked up shit.

01:02:39.054 --> 01:02:40.038
Shh!

01:02:40.138 --> 01:02:41.122
How are you feeling?

01:02:41.223 --> 01:02:44.556
I don't know.

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:47.185
First time I'm thinking these
cigarettes are pretty dangerous.

01:02:47.296 --> 01:02:49.264
You might be right about that.

01:02:49.364 --> 01:02:50.797
What are you doing?

01:02:52.568 --> 01:02:54.502
It may be small,
but it'll do the trick.

01:02:54.603 --> 01:02:55.729
One shot, bam.

01:02:55.837 --> 01:02:58.101
Listen, Nick is not
going to shoot anyone.

01:02:58.206 --> 01:02:59.332
Cool.

01:02:59.441 --> 01:03:00.408
Yeah, huh?

01:03:00.508 --> 01:03:01.703
I mean, uh...

01:03:01.810 --> 01:03:03.641
guns are to be treated with
respect, you understand that?

01:03:03.745 --> 01:03:05.713
You'll make a great father.

01:03:05.814 --> 01:03:07.179
Thanks.

01:03:11.153 --> 01:03:12.643
Hey, there he is!

01:03:12.754 --> 01:03:14.449
Hey, he's back!

01:03:14.556 --> 01:03:15.989
Hey!

01:03:16.091 --> 01:03:17.524
Welcome back.

01:03:17.626 --> 01:03:19.719
- You okay?
- Great.

01:03:19.828 --> 01:03:21.557
Good, 'cause you're booked on
all the Sunday talk shows.

01:03:21.663 --> 01:03:24.461
For once we got public sympathy
on our side.

01:03:24.566 --> 01:03:27.228
We can start our own little
celebrity victim tour.

01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:29.702
I mean, we couldn't have planned
this thing better ourselves.

01:03:29.805 --> 01:03:31.636
Oh, maybe next time
I can lose a lung.

01:03:33.275 --> 01:03:35.743
Oh. Uh, I heard the, uh...

01:03:35.844 --> 01:03:38.039
Heather Holloway article
is coming out tomorrow.

01:03:38.146 --> 01:03:40.080
Really?

01:03:40.182 --> 01:03:41.308
Yeah, anything I should be
worried about?

01:03:41.416 --> 01:03:43.884
Uh, yeah, the Cancer Association.

01:03:43.986 --> 01:03:45.351
Apparently, they have it in for us.

01:03:45.454 --> 01:03:47.684
Fuckers.

01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:59.083
What?

01:03:59.183 --> 01:04:01.829
I got a call from the paper.

01:04:01.937 --> 01:04:04.098
Really?
What'd they want?

01:04:04.206 --> 01:04:07.266
They wanted the correct spelling
of my name and job title.

01:04:07.376 --> 01:04:09.207
You didn't tell her
about us, did you?

01:04:09.311 --> 01:04:10.972
Who?

01:04:11.079 --> 01:04:12.273
Heather?

01:04:12.381 --> 01:04:14.246
No.

01:04:16.018 --> 01:04:18.213
I mean, maybe in passing, I...

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:19.947
In passing.

01:04:20.055 --> 01:04:21.283
Oh, God, he fucked her.

01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:22.755
I tried to warn you.

01:04:22.858 --> 01:04:25.292
Hey, he didn't fuck her.
You didn't fuck her, did you?

01:04:27.729 --> 01:04:29.196
When?

01:04:29.297 --> 01:04:30.264
In passing.

01:04:30.364 --> 01:04:31.458
Look, she's a really nice girl.

01:04:31.566 --> 01:04:32.590
Oh, God.

01:04:32.701 --> 01:04:34.692
We're really fucked.

Hey, Nick, what did you think?

01:06:08.296 --> 01:06:09.957
Heather, uh... I...

01:06:10.065 --> 01:06:12.556
I mean, there's a lot
of information in here, Heather,

01:06:12.667 --> 01:06:14.157
that is off the record.

01:06:14.269 --> 01:06:16.533
You never said anything
about off the record.

01:06:16.638 --> 01:06:21.075
I presumed anything said while
I was inside you was privileged.

01:06:21.176 --> 01:06:22.643
Nick...

01:06:22.744 --> 01:06:24.871
If you wanted to talk on a plane

01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:28.347
or at a movie or over dinner,
that would have been fine.

01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:30.475
But you wanted to fuck.

01:06:30.585 --> 01:06:32.018
That's fine by me.

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:34.145
You used me.

01:06:34.256 --> 01:06:35.883
Oh, Nick, come on.

01:06:35.991 --> 01:06:38.016
Now we're being children.

01:06:38.126 --> 01:06:40.185
Look, we both love our jobs.

01:06:40.295 --> 01:06:42.855
I'm just a reporter,
and you're just a lobbyist.

01:06:42.964 --> 01:06:45.194
How can you do this to me?

01:06:47.469 --> 01:06:49.494
For the mortgage.

01:06:57.913 --> 01:06:58.896
Bitch.

01:06:58.996 --> 01:07:00.038
Whore.

01:07:00.148 --> 01:07:03.379
You should have been
more careful, Nick.

01:07:03.485 --> 01:07:06.283
You've destroyed all the good
will created by your kidnapping.

01:07:06.388 --> 01:07:07.685
Well, we'll work up a rebuttal.

01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:10.519
Heather Holloway isn't
the only reporter in town.

01:07:10.625 --> 01:07:11.785
No, there isn't going
to be any rebuttal.

01:07:11.893 --> 01:07:12.951
What do you mean?

01:07:13.061 --> 01:07:14.392
Don't talk to anyone.

01:07:14.496 --> 01:07:16.259
We're pulling you
from the congressional hearing.

01:07:16.364 --> 01:07:17.922
No, no, no. You can't pull me
from the congressional hearing.

01:07:18.033 --> 01:07:19.364
All you'll be doing is giving
credence to her article.

01:07:19.467 --> 01:07:20.695
I'm ready to testify.

01:07:20.802 --> 01:07:22.463
Look, Nick, half of my job
is damage control.

01:07:22.571 --> 01:07:23.663
Today, that consists

01:07:23.772 --> 01:07:26.400
of distancing ourselves
from you entirely-

01:07:26.508 --> 01:07:30.239
letting you take
all the heat on this article.

01:07:30.345 --> 01:07:32.074
Your job relied on your ability
to keep secrets

01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:33.272
and spin the truth.

01:07:33.381 --> 01:07:35.076
I just cannot imagine a way

01:07:35.183 --> 01:07:36.810
in which you could have fucked
up more.

01:07:36.918 --> 01:07:39.751
There's just no way I could
possibly keep you on staff.

01:07:39.855 --> 01:07:41.652
Then I assume you've run this
by the captain.

01:07:41.756 --> 01:07:43.690

<i>Agent Johnson with the FBI.</i>

01:08:55.764 --> 01:08:58.426
<i>Having not found any leads in</i>
<i>your kidnapping investigation,</i>

01:08:58.533 --> 01:08:59.830
<i>we're going to be</i>
<i>handing over the case</i>

01:08:59.935 --> 01:09:00.993
<i>to the local D.C. Police,</i>

01:09:01.102 --> 01:09:03.296
<i>so please refer to them</i>
<i>in the future</i>

01:09:03.404 --> 01:09:04.997
<i>for any updates and questions.</i>

01:09:06.942 --> 01:09:09.536
<i>Nick, Jack in Jeff Megall's office.</i>

01:09:09.644 --> 01:09:13.080
<i>Jeff really enjoyed</i>
<i>meeting you the other day</i>

01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:15.240
<i>and he's just... he's torn up</i>
<i>about the fact</i>

01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:17.113
<i>that you two couldn't find</i>
<i>a project to work on.</i>

01:09:17.218 --> 01:09:19.345
<i>He's really just... I don't know.</i>

01:09:19.453 --> 01:09:21.216
<i>So, listen,</i>
<i>but we should hang, at least,</i>

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:23.291
<i>so you drop me a line</i>
<i>whenever you're in town.</i>

01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:26.849
<i>Uh... my e-mail is, uh...</i>

01:09:42.444 --> 01:09:44.071
Who is it?

01:09:44.179 --> 01:09:46.078
It's me, Nick.

01:09:48.015 --> 01:09:50.541
Jill, this is a bad time.

01:09:50.652 --> 01:09:52.243
Let me in.

01:09:53.587 --> 01:09:55.351
No.

01:09:55.457 --> 01:09:58.426
I brought someone
who needs to talk to you.

01:10:03.631 --> 01:10:04.928
Hey, buddy.

01:10:05.033 --> 01:10:06.967
Hey, Dad.

01:10:07.068 --> 01:10:09.093
Coke in the fridge.

01:10:15.543 --> 01:10:20.310
So, this Heather Holloway,
she must have been pretty hot.

01:10:20.415 --> 01:10:23.316
Yes. She's pretty hot.

01:10:23.418 --> 01:10:25.443
Don't take it so hard.

01:10:25.553 --> 01:10:28.181
A few flaws can be appealing.

01:10:28.289 --> 01:10:29.381
Makes you human.

01:10:29.491 --> 01:10:30.924
Who wants to be human?

01:10:31.026 --> 01:10:32.391
Well, I know one person

01:10:32.494 --> 01:10:35.463
who still thinks you're a God.

01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:54.676
Why did you tell that reporter
all your secrets?

01:10:57.919 --> 01:11:00.547
You're too young to understand.

01:11:00.655 --> 01:11:03.749
Mom says it's because
you have dependency issues

01:11:03.858 --> 01:11:05.348
and it was all just
a matter of time

01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:07.621
before you threw it all away
on some tramp.

01:11:07.729 --> 01:11:11.028
Well, that's one theory.

01:11:11.132 --> 01:11:12.963
Why are you hiding from everyone?

01:11:13.068 --> 01:11:18.665
It has something to do with
being generally hated right now.

01:11:18.773 --> 01:11:20.263
But it's your job to be
generally hated.

01:11:20.375 --> 01:11:23.139
It's more complicated
than that, Joey.

01:11:23.244 --> 01:11:25.508
You're just making it
more complicated

01:11:25.613 --> 01:11:27.171
so that you can feel
sorry for yourself.

01:11:27.282 --> 01:11:29.011
Like you always said,

01:11:29.117 --> 01:11:32.416
"If you want an easy job,
go work for the Red Cross."

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:34.147
You're a lobbyist.

01:11:34.255 --> 01:11:37.349
Your job is to be right, and
you're the best at what you do.

01:11:38.993 --> 01:11:40.392
You're the sultan of spin.

01:11:41.596 --> 01:11:42.995
"Sultan of spin"?

01:11:43.098 --> 01:11:44.622
<i>Mom subscribes to <i>Newsweek.</i></i>

01:11:46.067 --> 01:11:47.398
Who cares what the Brads

01:11:47.502 --> 01:11:48.526
of the world think?

01:11:48.636 --> 01:11:49.898
He's not my dad.

01:11:51.606 --> 01:11:53.073
You are.

01:11:53.174 --> 01:11:56.405
<i>And right there,</i>
<i>looking into Joeyâ€™s eyes,</i>

01:11:56.511 --> 01:11:59.912
<i>it all came back in a rush.</i>

01:12:00.014 --> 01:12:02.482
<i>Why I do what I do-</i>
<i>defending the defenseless,</i>

01:12:02.584 --> 01:12:04.882
<i>protecting the disenfranchised</i>
<i>corporations</i>

01:12:04.986 --> 01:12:07.045
<i>that have been abandoned</i>
<i>by their very own consumers-</i>

01:12:07.155 --> 01:12:09.419
<i>the logger...</i>

01:12:09.524 --> 01:12:11.754
<i>the sweatshop foreman...</i>

01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:13.885
<i>the oil driller...</i>

01:12:13.995 --> 01:12:16.156
<i>the land mine developer...</i>

01:12:16.264 --> 01:12:19.563
<i>the baby seal poacher...</i>

01:12:19.667 --> 01:12:21.066
Baby seal poacher?

01:12:21.169 --> 01:12:22.534
Even I think that's kind of cruel.

01:12:22.637 --> 01:12:24.730
All right, you're missing the point.

01:12:24.839 --> 01:12:26.602
I must be, because I thought
you were apologizing.

01:12:26.708 --> 01:12:27.691
I'm getting to that.

01:12:27.791 --> 01:12:29.538
When?

01:12:29.644 --> 01:12:32.112
Look.

01:12:32.213 --> 01:12:37.048
The two of you, you're
basically my only friends,

01:12:37.152 --> 01:12:39.450
and the last thing that
I would ever want to do

01:12:39.554 --> 01:12:41.249
would be to hurt you.

01:12:41.356 --> 01:12:43.221
And, I can only imagine...

01:12:43.324 --> 01:12:44.348
Why are you smiling?

01:12:44.459 --> 01:12:46.120
Why is he smiling?

01:12:46.227 --> 01:12:48.320
He won a hundred bucks off of you.

01:12:48.429 --> 01:12:51.455
I bet Polly you'd spill the beans
to that reporter.

01:12:51.566 --> 01:12:54.034
That goes against everything
that we stand for.

01:12:54.135 --> 01:12:56.399
Oh, please! You've ratted us out
to some reporter with tits!

01:12:56.504 --> 01:12:58.404
Glorious tits.

01:12:58.506 --> 01:13:00.804
Only after you created a betting
pool testing my incompetence?

01:13:00.909 --> 01:13:02.968
Do you have any idea the beating
I'm taking at Moderation?

01:13:03.077 --> 01:13:05.807
Well, look, I'm sure both of
you are under a lot of scrutiny.

01:13:05.914 --> 01:13:08.109
You know what?
You can stop using the plural.

01:13:08.216 --> 01:13:11.413
The guys at Safety actually liked
the name "Merchants of Death."

01:13:11.519 --> 01:13:12.816
They're gonna have
some bumper stickers made up.

01:13:12.921 --> 01:13:14.821
I'll make sure you get one.

01:13:14.923 --> 01:13:16.857
Thank you.

01:13:19.027 --> 01:13:20.858
That is disgusting.

01:13:22.230 --> 01:13:23.959
It's American.

01:13:24.065 --> 01:13:25.623
Can I have a bite?

01:13:25.733 --> 01:13:27.257
Mmm.

01:13:27.368 --> 01:13:29.427
So I guess this means

01:13:29.537 --> 01:13:32.768
you won't be appearing
at Finistirre's subcommittee.

01:13:32.874 --> 01:13:35.104
Hmm. I was kind of looking
forward to it, too.

01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:37.974
It's kind of cool in
a Jimmy Stewart sort of way.

01:13:38.079 --> 01:13:40.604
More like an Ollie North sort of way.

01:13:40.715 --> 01:13:42.945
Finistirre would have
torn you a new asshole

01:13:43.051 --> 01:13:44.575
in a House of Parliament, no less.

01:13:44.686 --> 01:13:45.983
I could have taken him.

01:13:46.087 --> 01:13:47.748
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah? What would you have said?

01:13:47.855 --> 01:13:49.083
I don't know.

01:13:49.190 --> 01:13:52.421
I'd just like him to feel
immeasurable pain,

01:13:52.527 --> 01:13:53.994
humiliation.

01:13:54.095 --> 01:13:55.562
Yeah, well, that would be
kind of tough.

01:13:55.663 --> 01:13:57.028
I mean, he's already a Senator.

01:13:58.967 --> 01:14:01.162
I mean, how would you get
back in even if you wanted to?

01:14:05.206 --> 01:14:06.366
Uh-oh.

01:14:12.313 --> 01:14:13.610
You're not gonna like this.

01:14:16.718 --> 01:14:17.844
Hello.
Thanks very much for coming.

01:14:17.952 --> 01:14:20.284
First of all, I'd like to say
a few words

01:14:20.388 --> 01:14:21.514
to all the people who
are mentioned

01:14:21.623 --> 01:14:23.682
in the recent newspaper article.

01:14:23.791 --> 01:14:25.281
Please take comfort in knowing

01:14:25.393 --> 01:14:29.159
that I will not rest until
your names are cleared.

01:14:29.264 --> 01:14:31.357
This experience has taught me
an important lesson-

01:14:31.466 --> 01:14:33.263
having sexual affairs
with members of the press

01:14:33.368 --> 01:14:34.858
is just unfair.

01:14:34.969 --> 01:14:36.800
It's not unfair to me, mind you,

01:14:36.904 --> 01:14:40.362
but to all the people in my life
whose only crime is knowing me.

01:14:40.475 --> 01:14:43.672
It was your names, not mine,
that suffered

01:14:43.778 --> 01:14:46.303
from a meaningless affair
with a seductress

01:14:46.414 --> 01:14:49.872
in the form of a young
brunette Washington reporter

01:14:49.984 --> 01:14:51.542
whose name I won't mention

01:14:51.653 --> 01:14:53.587
because I have dignity.

01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:56.514
Mr. Naylor!

01:14:56.624 --> 01:14:58.421
Are you still planning
on testifying

01:14:58.526 --> 01:15:00.619
at tomorrow's subcommittee
hearing on tobacco?

01:15:00.728 --> 01:15:02.992
I'm glad you asked that question.

01:15:03.097 --> 01:15:04.860
There have been wide accusations of me
dropping out of tomorrow's hearing.

01:15:04.966 --> 01:15:06.194
Let it be known

01:15:06.301 --> 01:15:08.030
that unless Senator Finistirre
has withdrawn my invitation

01:15:08.136 --> 01:15:09.569
- to speak, it is my plan
- It's called a subpoena.

01:15:09.671 --> 01:15:11.502
To be in Congress tomorrow
to share my knowledge

01:15:11.606 --> 01:15:13.870
of big tobacco and all those
who enjoy its products.

01:15:13.975 --> 01:15:15.237
Thank you very much.
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:16:14.902 --> 01:16:17.496
Still feel like Jimmy Stewart?

01:16:28.516 --> 01:16:29.516
Good.

01:16:37.592 --> 01:16:38.684
Why don't you all go ahead?

01:16:38.793 --> 01:16:40.317
This could be a while.

01:16:45.199 --> 01:16:50.227
If we could, um... if we could
take our seats, please.

01:16:52.974 --> 01:16:55.534
Gentlemen, ladies.

01:16:55.643 --> 01:16:58.373
If I may call this meeting to order.

01:16:58.479 --> 01:17:03.246
We'll do everything we can to
keep things brief and concise

01:17:03.351 --> 01:17:04.875
so that we can all
get out of here on time.

01:17:04.986 --> 01:17:08.478
The skull and crossbones
means one thing:

01:17:08.589 --> 01:17:10.056
Poison.

01:17:10.158 --> 01:17:12.854
Thus, the message is quite clear.

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:15.121
Like any other product
that carries the branding,

01:17:15.229 --> 01:17:18.460
if you take it, you will die.

01:17:18.566 --> 01:17:21.626
Yes, but isn't this overkill?

01:17:21.736 --> 01:17:25.001
Why don't we just use words,
as we currently do?

01:17:25.106 --> 01:17:28.906
Something that describes the
dangers of cigarette smoking.

01:17:29.010 --> 01:17:30.034
Well, the American public
is not affected

01:17:30.144 --> 01:17:31.611
by masthead anymore.

01:17:31.712 --> 01:17:32.872
They need images.

01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:35.346
We've done studies
which show that consumers react

01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:38.010
up to 80% more to imagery
rather than words.

01:17:38.119 --> 01:17:39.416
The stats are there.

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:41.317
It's just sad

01:17:41.422 --> 01:17:43.754
that the Academy of Tobacco
Studies did not release

01:17:43.858 --> 01:17:45.257
this type of information earlier.

01:17:45.359 --> 01:17:48.328
When you say
the Academy of Tobacco Studies,

01:17:48.429 --> 01:17:49.760
you're referring to...

01:17:49.864 --> 01:17:50.990
Yes.

01:17:51.098 --> 01:17:52.827
To the coalition...

01:17:52.934 --> 01:17:53.901
Yes, the coalition.

01:17:54.001 --> 01:17:55.560
The big... big tobacco...

01:17:55.670 --> 01:17:56.932
...that is represented by...

01:17:57.038 --> 01:17:58.266
By, um...

01:17:58.372 --> 01:17:59.498
And specifically

01:17:59.607 --> 01:18:00.557
Mr...

01:18:00.657 --> 01:18:01.666
Um...

01:18:01.776 --> 01:18:03.368
Mr., uh, Nick Naylor.

01:18:03.478 --> 01:18:04.428
Nick Naylor?

01:18:04.528 --> 01:18:05.479
Thank you very much.

01:18:07.448 --> 01:18:08.398
<i>The current use</i>

01:18:08.498 --> 01:18:10.076
of words instead of imagery

01:18:10.184 --> 01:18:13.779
is an obvious move against
the non-English-speaking population

01:18:13.888 --> 01:18:15.355
of the United States.

01:18:15.456 --> 01:18:17.583
The skull and crossbones

01:18:17.692 --> 01:18:21.059
speak loudly in all languages.

01:18:21.162 --> 01:18:23.756
By not using it,
they're saying

01:18:23.865 --> 01:18:27.892
they want those who can't
read English to die.

01:18:28.002 --> 01:18:29.765
Hmm. Senor Herrera,

01:18:29.871 --> 01:18:32.704
could you clarify "they"?

01:18:32.807 --> 01:18:34.104
<i>Let it be known,</i>

01:18:34.208 --> 01:18:36.676
<i>the public beating</i>
<i>has not gone out of style.</i>

01:18:44.018 --> 01:18:46.179
Nick Naylor, please step forward.

01:18:55.897 --> 01:18:58.525
You go sit with him.

01:19:06.908 --> 01:19:09.900
Please state your name,
address and current occupation.

01:19:10.011 --> 01:19:11.137
My name is Nick Naylor.

01:19:11.245 --> 01:19:13.008
I live at 6000
Massachusetts Avenue

01:19:13.114 --> 01:19:15.014
and I am currently unemployed,

01:19:15.116 --> 01:19:17.243
but until recently,
I was the vice president

01:19:17.351 --> 01:19:18.841
of the Academy of Tobacco Studies.

01:19:18.953 --> 01:19:19.903
Mr. Naylor,

01:19:20.003 --> 01:19:23.412
as vice president
of the Academy

01:19:23.524 --> 01:19:25.492
of Tobacco Studies,
what was required of you?

01:19:25.593 --> 01:19:26.821
What did you do?

01:19:26.928 --> 01:19:30.420
I informed the public
of all the research performed

01:19:30.531 --> 01:19:32.522
in the investigation
on the effects of tobacco.

01:19:32.633 --> 01:19:33.759
Mm-hmm,
and what,

01:19:33.868 --> 01:19:36.428
so far,
has the Academy concluded

01:19:36.537 --> 01:19:38.971
in their investigation
into the effects of tobacco?

01:19:39.073 --> 01:19:41.337
Well, many things, actually.

01:19:41.442 --> 01:19:43.205
Why, just the other day
they uncovered evidence

01:19:43.311 --> 01:19:45.142
that smoking can offset
Parkinson's disease.

01:19:47.081 --> 01:19:48.309
I'm sure the health
community

01:19:48.416 --> 01:19:49.542
is thrilled.

01:19:49.650 --> 01:19:52.551
Mr. Naylor, who provides
the financial backing

01:19:52.653 --> 01:19:54.621
for the Academy of Tobacco Studies?

01:19:54.722 --> 01:19:57.987
Uh... Conglomerated Tobacco.

01:19:58.092 --> 01:19:59.787
That's the cigarette companies.

01:19:59.894 --> 01:20:01.953
For the most part, yes.

01:20:02.063 --> 01:20:04.964
Do you think that...

01:20:05.066 --> 01:20:07.034
might affect their priorities?

01:20:07.134 --> 01:20:08.465
No, just as I'm sure

01:20:08.569 --> 01:20:10.400
campaign contributions
don't affect yours.

01:20:10.504 --> 01:20:11.528
Oh.

01:20:13.507 --> 01:20:16.738
Senators, Mr. Naylor is not here
to testify on the goings-on

01:20:16.844 --> 01:20:18.641
of the Academy of Tobacco Studies.

01:20:18.746 --> 01:20:20.805
We're here to examine
the possibility

01:20:20.915 --> 01:20:22.314
of a warning logo on cigarettes.

01:20:22.416 --> 01:20:23.400
Now, Mr. Naylor,

01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:25.008
I have to ask you,
out of formality,

01:20:25.119 --> 01:20:27.087
do you believe that smoking
cigarettes, over time,

01:20:27.188 --> 01:20:30.419
can lead to lung cancer and
other respiratory conditions

01:20:30.524 --> 01:20:31.718
such as emphysema?

01:20:33.594 --> 01:20:35.084
Yes.

01:20:37.932 --> 01:20:38.882
In fact, I think you'd be
hard-pressed

01:20:38.982 --> 01:20:40.025
to find someone
who really believes

01:20:40.134 --> 01:20:42.102
that cigarettes are not
potentially harmful.

01:20:42.203 --> 01:20:44.433
I mean, show of hands,
who out here thinks

01:20:44.538 --> 01:20:46.028
- that cigarettes aren't dangerous...
- Mr. Naylor.

01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:49.268
There's no need for theatrics.

01:20:49.377 --> 01:20:51.937
Sir, I just don't see the point in a warning
label for something people already know.

01:20:52.046 --> 01:20:53.343
The warning symbol

01:20:53.447 --> 01:20:57.076
is a reminder, a reminder of the
dangers of smoking cigarettes.

01:20:57.184 --> 01:20:59.015
Well, if we want to remind
people of danger,

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.644
why don't we slap
a skull and crossbones

01:21:00.755 --> 01:21:01.738
on all Boeing airplanes,

01:21:01.838 --> 01:21:03.255
Senator Lothridge?

01:21:03.357 --> 01:21:04.324
And all Fords, Senator Dupree?

01:21:04.424 --> 01:21:06.724
That is ridiculous.

01:21:06.827 --> 01:21:09.125
The death toll from airline
and automobile accidents

01:21:09.230 --> 01:21:11.289
doesn't even skim the surface
of cigarettes.

01:21:11.399 --> 01:21:12.457
They don't even compare.

01:21:12.566 --> 01:21:14.625
Oh, this from a senator
who calls Vermont home.

01:21:14.735 --> 01:21:16.862
I don't follow you, Mr. Naylor.

01:21:16.971 --> 01:21:18.632
Well, the real

01:21:18.739 --> 01:21:21.299
demonstrated number one killer
in America is cholesterol,

01:21:21.409 --> 01:21:22.409
and here comes
Senator Finistirre,

01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:24.740
whose fine state is,
I regret to say,

01:21:24.845 --> 01:21:27.871
clogging the nation's arteries
with Vermont cheddar cheese.

01:21:29.517 --> 01:21:32.247
If we want to talk numbers,
how about the millions of people

01:21:32.353 --> 01:21:33.337
dying of heart attacks.

01:21:33.437 --> 01:21:34.683
Perhaps Vermont cheddar

01:21:34.789 --> 01:21:37.155
should come
with a skull and crossbones.

01:21:37.258 --> 01:21:39.089
That is lud...

01:21:39.193 --> 01:21:40.177
The great state of Vermont

01:21:40.277 --> 01:21:41.819
will not apologize for its cheese.

01:21:41.929 --> 01:21:42.913
Mr. Naylor,

01:21:43.013 --> 01:21:44.487
we are here to discuss cigarettes.

01:21:44.598 --> 01:21:48.227
Not planes, not cars- cigarettes.

01:21:48.335 --> 01:21:50.997
Now, as we discussed earlier,
these warning labels

01:21:51.105 --> 01:21:54.302
are not for those who know, but
rather for those who don't know.

01:21:56.277 --> 01:21:58.268
What about the children?

01:21:58.379 --> 01:22:00.404
Gentlemen...

01:22:00.514 --> 01:22:02.448
it's called education.

01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:04.415
It doesn't come off the side
of a cigarette carton.

01:22:04.518 --> 01:22:05.576
It comes from our teachers,

01:22:05.686 --> 01:22:07.745
and more importantly, our parents.

01:22:07.855 --> 01:22:10.983
It is the job
of every parent

01:22:11.092 --> 01:22:14.721
to warn their children of all
the dangers of the world,

01:22:14.829 --> 01:22:17.389
including cigarettes, so that
one day, when they get older,

01:22:17.498 --> 01:22:19.329
they can choose for themselves.

01:22:21.569 --> 01:22:24.732
I look at my... son

01:22:24.839 --> 01:22:26.238
who...

01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:28.171
was kind enough
to come with me today,

01:22:28.275 --> 01:22:30.766
and I can't help but think

01:22:30.878 --> 01:22:33.142
that I am responsible
for his growth

01:22:33.247 --> 01:22:35.374
and his development.

01:22:35.483 --> 01:22:37.007
And I'm proud of that.

01:22:37.118 --> 01:22:38.380
Well, having
said that,

01:22:38.486 --> 01:22:41.046
would you condone him smoking?

01:22:41.155 --> 01:22:43.487
Well, of course not.
He's not 18.

01:22:43.591 --> 01:22:44.649
That would be illegal.

01:22:45.926 --> 01:22:48.019
<i>Yes, l-I heard you deliver</i>
<i>that line on <i>20-20,</i></i>

01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:49.494
but enough dancing.

01:22:49.597 --> 01:22:51.929
What are you going to do
when he turns 18?

01:22:53.601 --> 01:22:55.159
Come on, Mr. Naylor.

01:22:55.269 --> 01:22:58.830
On his 18th birthday, will
you share a cigarette with him?

01:22:58.939 --> 01:23:01.169
Will you spend
a lovely afternoon,

01:23:01.275 --> 01:23:03.436
like one of your ludicrous
cigarette advertisements?

01:23:03.544 --> 01:23:05.068
You seem to have a lot to say

01:23:05.179 --> 01:23:06.510
about how we
should raise our children.

01:23:06.614 --> 01:23:07.597
What of your own?

01:23:07.697 --> 01:23:10.149
What are you
going to do

01:23:10.251 --> 01:23:12.549
when he turns 18?

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:22.823
If he really wants a cigarette,
I'll buy him his first pack.

01:23:27.568 --> 01:23:30.401
Thank you for your testimony,
Mr. Naylor. You're excused.

01:23:37.244 --> 01:23:38.677
I'll meet you outside, okay?

01:23:51.258 --> 01:23:52.816
Great.

01:23:52.927 --> 01:23:54.053
Well done, my boy.

01:23:54.161 --> 01:23:56.288
Were you in the same room as me?

01:23:56.397 --> 01:23:57.489
The whole personal choice thing?

01:23:57.598 --> 01:23:58.724
They ate that shit up.

01:23:58.833 --> 01:24:00.664
Just checked the whip count.

01:24:00.768 --> 01:24:02.167
That bill is going down in flames.

01:24:02.269 --> 01:24:05.102
Your speech was unorthodox,
but you did it, boy.

01:24:05.206 --> 01:24:06.156
You crushed the fucker.

01:24:06.256 --> 01:24:07.333
That's good news for you guys.

01:24:07.441 --> 01:24:08.840
Oh. Whoa, whoa.

01:24:08.943 --> 01:24:11.844
We're still a team, right?

01:24:11.946 --> 01:24:13.914
What about damage control?

01:24:15.416 --> 01:24:16.781
Look, Nick.

01:24:16.884 --> 01:24:20.479
Winston-Salem is ready
to do whatever it takes

01:24:20.588 --> 01:24:22.112
to keep you onboard.

01:24:30.364 --> 01:24:33.424
Nick, will you continue
fighting for cigarettes?

01:24:33.534 --> 01:24:34.865
Of course he will.

01:24:34.969 --> 01:24:36.937
This man here is our general.

01:24:37.037 --> 01:24:38.800
We're not just gonna let him retire.

01:24:38.906 --> 01:24:39.930
Is that correct, Nick?

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:41.530
You're sticking with tobacco?

01:24:45.579 --> 01:24:49.071
<i>Now, I know what</i>
<i>you're probably thinking.</i>

01:24:49.183 --> 01:24:50.343
<i>What a great opportunity for me</i>

01:24:50.451 --> 01:24:52.043
<i>to teach Joey</i>
<i>how to use leverage against</i>

01:24:52.152 --> 01:24:53.744
<i>a backstabbing boss.</i>

01:24:53.854 --> 01:24:57.290
<i>But I actually meant what</i>
<i>I said about responsibility.</i>

01:24:57.391 --> 01:25:01.020
<i>Some things</i>
<i>are just more important</i>

01:25:01.128 --> 01:25:02.288
<i>than paying a mortgage.</i>

01:25:02.396 --> 01:25:04.990
<i>So I did the only responsible</i>
<i>thing I could.</i>

01:25:05.099 --> 01:25:07.863
<i>I turned down the job.</i>

01:25:07.968 --> 01:25:10.300
<i>And my timing</i>
<i>couldn't have been better.</i>

01:25:10.404 --> 01:25:12.702
<i>Within a few months,</i>
<i>the cigarette companies</i>

01:25:12.806 --> 01:25:14.205
<i>settled</i>
<i>with the American smoker</i>

01:25:14.308 --> 01:25:16.970
<i>to the tune of $246 billion.</i>

01:25:18.145 --> 01:25:20.477
<i>And the Academy</i>
<i>of Tobacco Studies</i>

01:25:20.581 --> 01:25:22.344
<i>was permanently dismantled.</i>

01:25:22.449 --> 01:25:24.747
<i>For the first time in decades,</i>

01:25:24.852 --> 01:25:26.547
<i>BR found himself out of work.</i>

01:25:28.322 --> 01:25:30.415
<i>Otherwise, not much has changed.</i>

01:25:30.524 --> 01:25:32.685
<i>The MOD squad still meets every week.</i>

01:25:32.793 --> 01:25:34.090
Nice.

01:25:34.194 --> 01:25:36.458
<i>We even added a few new members.</i>

01:25:36.563 --> 01:25:39.361
The things I could learn
from you, Bobby Jay.

01:25:39.466 --> 01:25:40.466
Right.

01:25:40.567 --> 01:25:42.000
Stick around. Stick around.

01:25:42.102 --> 01:25:44.832
<i>Senator Finistirre is still</i>
<i>fighting for his causes.</i>

01:25:44.939 --> 01:25:46.702
What do you say
to the people who claim

01:25:46.807 --> 01:25:48.741
you are destroying cinema classics?

01:25:48.842 --> 01:25:50.469
Mmm, no. All
we're doing

01:25:50.577 --> 01:25:52.238
is using
digital technology

01:25:52.346 --> 01:25:55.509
to tastefully update
movies of the past...

01:25:55.616 --> 01:25:57.174
by removing cigarettes.

01:25:57.284 --> 01:26:00.515
<i>I believe that if these</i>
<i>stars were alive today,</i>

01:26:00.621 --> 01:26:03.055
<i>they would agree that</i>
<i>we're doing the right thing.</i>

01:26:03.157 --> 01:26:04.886
But, in essence, aren't
you changing history?

01:26:04.992 --> 01:26:08.928
No, I think we're improving history.

01:26:10.798 --> 01:26:12.129
<i>Even Heather is still reporting.</i>

01:26:12.232 --> 01:26:13.597
The whole town has been evacuated.

01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:19.003
They're calling this
the storm of the century.

01:26:19.106 --> 01:26:20.437
<i>Not much changes at all.</i>

01:26:20.541 --> 01:26:25.240
And this year's Foggy Bottom
Debating Society Champion is...

01:26:25.346 --> 01:26:26.346
Joey Naylor.

01:26:26.447 --> 01:26:27.607
- Yay!
- Yay!

01:26:27.715 --> 01:26:28.665
Joey!

01:26:28.765 --> 01:26:29.666
Joey!

01:26:29.766 --> 01:26:30.667
Joey, Joey!

01:26:30.767 --> 01:26:32.242
That's my boy.

01:26:32.353 --> 01:26:33.911
Hold it up. Hold it up.

01:26:37.558 --> 01:26:39.583
<i>And me?</i>

01:26:39.693 --> 01:26:42.389
<i>Well, there's still a place</i>
<i>for guys like me.</i>

01:26:42.496 --> 01:26:45.124
So, be straight with me.

01:26:45.232 --> 01:26:47.962
Is it true?

01:26:48.068 --> 01:26:49.467
- It could be.
- Come on.

01:26:49.570 --> 01:26:51.663
We know of very few cases.

01:26:51.772 --> 01:26:52.898
There's no scientific proof at all.

01:26:53.007 --> 01:26:53.957
There was an unfortunate
incident out in Iowa...

01:26:54.057 --> 01:26:54.991
It's really a complicated situation.

01:26:55.091 --> 01:26:56.269
Gentlemen,

01:26:56.377 --> 01:26:58.971
practice these words
in front of the mirror.

01:26:59.079 --> 01:27:02.048
"Although we are constantly
exploring the subject,

01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:04.845
"currently,
there is no direct evidence

01:27:04.952 --> 01:27:06.351
"that links cell phone usage

01:27:06.453 --> 01:27:08.318
to brain cancer."
