this was an accident.

it's not the first time he's
made some trouble in my town.

release him to me

15:35.852 --> 15:38.514
Thank you. All right,
I'll see you then.

15:41.191 --> 15:44.149
Sounds like you're
shaking things up
in there.

15:44.861 --> 15:46.772
From the looks of the place,
I'd say they could use it.

15:47.614 --> 15:48.694
Is that right?

15:48.782 --> 15:53.116
Tell me something.
How's a girl like you
end up in a place like this?

15:53.203 --> 15:54.864
(LAUGHS) You'd have
to do better than that.

15:54.955 --> 15:58.413
The name is Samuel.
And I'm here to
ask you one question.

15:58.500 --> 16:02.960
If you're here to save
young Jeremy's life,
then what's next?

16:04.464 --> 16:07.001
Are you gonna take him
to a place just to live?

(CARNIVAL MUSIC PLAYING)

Or where he belongs?

16:27.696 --> 16:28.651
What did you do?

16:28.738 --> 16:29.773
It's all right.

16:29.865 --> 16:30.820
Stay back.

16:30.907 --> 16:32.647
I'm a friend, Tracy.

16:33.660 --> 16:34.820
How do you know
my name?

16:34.911 --> 16:36.742
It's all right.
You're safe here.

16:36.830 --> 16:39.993
I'm like you.
We're all like you.

16:42.252 --> 16:43.367
What is this place?

16:45.046 --> 16:46.206
Home.

16:56.683 --> 16:59.925
Slaughter floor
or operations center?

17:00.729 --> 17:02.219
CLAIRE: Should I even ask?

17:02.981 --> 17:04.767
Have a nice Hell Week.

17:12.824 --> 17:14.155
After you.

17:21.958 --> 17:23.573
CLAIRE: Ugh.

17:29.299 --> 17:31.085
So, how long
have you known?

17:31.176 --> 17:35.089
Known what?
That I really don't wanna
be in this sorority?

17:35.639 --> 17:37.425
That you liked girls.

17:37.641 --> 17:38.801
(LAUGHS)

17:38.892 --> 17:41.508
You make it sound
like I have to declare.

17:41.603 --> 17:43.639
Like it's my major
or something.

17:44.689 --> 17:46.645
I'm actually jealous.

17:47.234 --> 17:51.068
First year of college
and you've already
figured yourself out.

17:51.696 --> 17:53.436
I don't know about that.

17:53.531 --> 17:56.113
Truth is, I've had
more boyfriends
than girlfriends.

17:56.243 --> 17:57.449
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

17:58.453 --> 17:59.954
How many more?

18:01.790 --> 18:04.497
Six or seven.
It's not a lot, right?

18:06.086 --> 18:07.792
Sounds about right.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.586
But you're not...

18:10.674 --> 18:13.507
No, you couldn't be.
You were a cheerleader.

18:13.593 --> 18:14.833
Not what?

18:15.512 --> 18:16.752
A virgin.

18:18.807 --> 18:20.763

18:21.393 --> 18:23.600
We could not be
more different.

18:23.687 --> 18:25.973
Maybe we're
strange attractors.

18:26.398 --> 18:28.013
Strange attractors?

18:28.400 --> 18:29.936
It's a physics thing.

18:30.026 --> 18:32.278
Everything in the universe
has a magnetic charge, right?

18:32.362 --> 18:34.318
So strange attractors
are particles

18:34.406 --> 18:36.522
that end up together
that don't really
belong together,

18:36.616 --> 18:39.153
but when they're together,
they're super powerful.

18:39.244 --> 18:41.360
Sort of like
we could be.

Or not.

What?

Hold on.

Come on. Don't tell me
you're freaked out now.

This is the life
Jeremy could have.

19:18.575 --> 19:20.907
What? Working
at a carnival?

19:21.244 --> 19:24.577
Surrounded by family.
His true family.

19:29.336 --> 19:32.328
Do you remember the first time
you experienced your gift?

19:32.422 --> 19:35.164
"Gift" might be
a little generous.

19:35.258 --> 19:39.217
Like the entire universe
coursing through you,
all at once.

19:39.304 --> 19:41.795
That wasn't just
your ability, Tracy.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.845

into something
greater than yourself.

We're all connected.

Every time someone

20:07.457 --> 20:08.742
It's an energy, I guess.

20:08.833 --> 20:12.041
It gets stronger every day.
This is where
Jeremy should be.

20:12.629 --> 20:15.245
What, living in trailers?
Drifting from town to town?

20:15.340 --> 20:18.377
What would you do?
Give him a false name?
A false life?

20:19.135 --> 20:22.468
This is a boy
who can work miracles.
Why should he be invisible?

20:24.307 --> 20:27.140
Bring him home.
You could join him.

20:28.520 --> 20:31.887
I know you've been lost, too.
It's your nature.

20:31.981 --> 20:33.357
That's enough.

20:34.943 --> 20:36.854
Just take me back now.

20:37.654 --> 20:38.894
Fair enough.

20:41.491 --> 20:44.153
Look, I'm never
about the hard sell,
but please take this.

20:44.661 --> 20:47.152
To find your way back here.

20:51.501 --> 20:53.162
This is Lydia.

20:54.212 --> 20:55.998
She'll take you
from here.

She came to me
when she was sad.

No.

they're not yours.

isn't in here,

always do this?

We're going on 15 years

21:55.815 --> 21:57.851

everything up again?

a terrible thing.

out there using my body

that you could do that.

is rattling around up in here.

down from me

in my apartment
building in DC.

25:54.303 --> 25:56.168
I've set up a new
identity for you.

25:56.264 --> 25:58.220
Your name is
Jarod Mitchell,

25:58.307 --> 26:01.219
and you're going to attend
Georgetown High School.

26:01.310 --> 26:03.392
So nobody will know
what I can do?

26:03.479 --> 26:06.221
You'll learn to
control your ability
with Tracy's help.

26:06.649 --> 26:09.982
But you're gonna
keep it to yourself.
It's the only way.

26:10.820 --> 26:12.435
What if something happens?

26:15.408 --> 26:18.445
Nothing's going to happen.
You'll be safe.

You'll be invisible.

you think a sorority brought
us out here to kill us?

just move itself.

no one else there.

26:40.850 --> 26:43.262
How else would you
explain it?

26:43.352 --> 26:45.604
In my world,
there's a million ways.

26:45.688 --> 26:47.098
Name one.

26:47.190 --> 26:48.350
Telekinesis.

26:49.192 --> 26:52.355
I've seen it.
Heck, I know
someone who has it.

26:52.987 --> 26:56.730
So, wait, you're saying
there's another
one of you here?

26:56.824 --> 26:58.655
CLAIRE: It's very possible.

26:59.285 --> 27:02.072
And, what, they're bored
and they're playing
a college prank on you?

27:03.331 --> 27:04.787
Not a prank.

You think that
they're trying
to kill you?

27:09.212 --> 27:10.497

committed suicide

with a mysterious note
that wasn't there,
but then it was.

27:26.479 --> 27:29.721
I mean, maybe
you almost getting gutted
wasn't a coincidence.

27:30.900 --> 27:33.812
Claire, that is
a little out there.

27:33.903 --> 27:36.861
Sounds like some
crazy-ass conspiracy theory.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.407
Which pretty much
describes your entire life.

27:44.413 --> 27:45.914

all right?

tell you.

28:02.056 --> 28:03.512
Look, your roommate's
freaked out,

28:03.599 --> 28:05.385
and we don't care
about the treasure.

get the hell out of here,

28:07.603 --> 28:10.515
and once we find it,
you can have it. Deal?

28:11.065 --> 28:13.727
Okay. Can we just go?
Deal.

28:15.111 --> 28:16.476

to your parents!

Hey, you're getting away

Let go of him.

Get the hell away from him.

Now, listen, son.

29:33.314 --> 29:35.054
You're going back in there,

You know what you did
to your momma and your daddy.

You can save him.
You can do it.

You do not understand
the first thing about
what's happening here.

30:10.267 --> 30:12.929
Three people are dead.
I understand that.

30:13.020 --> 30:15.682
And that boy,
whatever he is,
is responsible.

30:15.773 --> 30:19.391
Hey, do you want it
to happen again?
Just let me talk to him.

30:20.695 --> 30:22.185
Talk to him?

30:23.155 --> 30:26.488
You're through
talking to him.
Both of you.

killers go free, huh?
Not in this town.

Gil, do you read?

30:51.100 --> 30:55.935
The boy is gone.
Gil, do you read me?
Are you there?

30:57.106 --> 30:59.313
Not so tough now,
are you?

31:06.240 --> 31:09.107
Go ahead.

31:51.452 --> 31:56.822
I bought this with Janice
on our anniversary trip
to Ensenada.

31:57.458 --> 32:01.201
And it is so poetic
that I'm using it
to bury you.

32:01.295 --> 32:03.581
Bury me
or drown the truth?

32:03.672 --> 32:06.414
The truth? What?
That you're nothing.

shall we?

32:16.644 --> 32:18.760
Your wife
walked out on you.

32:20.356 --> 32:22.722
You think she wanted
to give you your space?

She can't stand
the sight of you.
You're pathetic.

32:26.153 --> 32:30.522
You know what
she said to me in front
of the fire last night?

32:31.534 --> 32:34.367
"Why can't you be
more like this
all the time?"

Why can't you
accept your power?

Why do you insist
on being so forgettable?

33:05.025 --> 33:07.107
Oh, man. You're afraid.

33:10.322 --> 33:12.233
You're afraid of dying.

Okay, okay.

"Kill house."

You, wanting to run
from your freaky world
and live a normal life.

on the spot and gotten
all relationshippy on you.

saved him.

You know,
this was supposed
to be simple.

37:57.234 --> 37:58.895
Just go in
and sign him out.

I thought
I could manage it.

38:01.363 --> 38:04.105
By hiding him away
for the rest of his life?

38:04.199 --> 38:07.908
I stood on his porch
and I told him that
I wouldn't let him down.

38:07.995 --> 38:09.360
But you did.

38:11.373 --> 38:12.453
We did.

38:13.542 --> 38:15.874
I did what I thought
was right.

38:16.670 --> 38:18.251
And l was wrong.

38:20.215 --> 38:22.797
I've been wrong
all these years.

38:22.885 --> 38:24.967
Do we have
to be invisible?

we could just live, Noah?

38:28.348 --> 38:29.929
Out in the open?

I know. I'm sorry.
ljust...

39:34.957 --> 39:39.200

You want your body back.

Did you think you were
actually winning?

40:48.905 --> 40:51.942

I slipped right in.
