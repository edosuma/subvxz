02:58.864 --> 03:00.573
Mornin'.

03:00.624 --> 03:02.473
Pitbull, everything okay?

03:02.544 --> 03:04.619
- How's things, brother?
- Not bad.

03:24.343 --> 03:26.092
Please, go in.

03:50.807 --> 03:52.698
Immortal...

03:53.721 --> 03:55.566
Hello, Don Aniello.

03:55.631 --> 03:56.956
What a pleasure!

03:57.029 --> 03:59.128
Thank you for agreeing to see me.

04:00.937 --> 04:03.688
Thank you for coming to my home.

04:03.748 --> 04:05.441
Have a seat.

04:09.386 --> 04:10.786
So...

04:11.649 --> 04:14.101
What can we do for you?

04:21.497 --> 04:24.259
Help me prevent another war.

04:40.604 --> 04:42.756
Ciro just got here.

04:42.809 --> 04:44.415
Ciro's here!

05:01.813 --> 05:03.358
Hi, Rosario!

05:05.311 --> 05:07.905
You could have said you
were seeing Don Aniello.

05:08.222 --> 05:10.413
It went well, that's what counts.

05:11.798 --> 05:14.490
I think we're screwin' up, Ciro!

05:14.548 --> 05:17.675
We can't leave Savastano here,
we gotta find him and kill him,

05:17.764 --> 05:19.816
him and Gennaro.

05:20.153 --> 05:23.315
Rosario, we went
through Savastano, Conte,

05:23.370 --> 05:25.064
now we rule.

05:25.118 --> 05:27.657
But to move on, we gotta make money.

05:28.298 --> 05:31.854
If not, we go hungry, and
hunger calls blood. Our people...

05:32.186 --> 05:34.485
don't want either.

05:36.765 --> 05:39.679
We gotta harness Pietro and Gennaro.

05:43.266 --> 05:45.260
Pitbull!

06:11.351 --> 06:13.180
Great, guys!

06:13.226 --> 06:14.951
Work fast!

06:39.446 --> 06:40.996
Hi, Aniello!

06:41.042 --> 06:43.917
Hi, I'm glad to see you.

06:43.979 --> 06:45.565
You're lookin' good.

06:45.609 --> 06:46.958
What's up?

06:47.259 --> 06:49.157
I like fruit

06:49.222 --> 06:51.589
and especially what your boy's got.

06:51.653 --> 06:53.754
Nothin' better!

06:55.571 --> 06:58.883
I'll tell you straight,
I don't like this situation.

06:58.929 --> 07:02.696
My boy, as you call him,
has to stay out of this.

07:03.005 --> 07:05.043
He does this, nothin' else.

07:05.921 --> 07:10.676
Giuseppe, I'm first to hope
things stay like this,

07:11.221 --> 07:13.450
but it takes peace

07:13.497 --> 07:16.496
to protect our affairs
and keep this boy calm.

07:17.342 --> 07:19.986
And you make peace with enemies.

07:21.522 --> 07:24.478
I can guarantee safety

07:24.756 --> 07:27.156
for Gennaro and the Immortal.

07:28.284 --> 07:30.830
But I need your word.

07:31.641 --> 07:34.105
Your boy mustn't screw up

07:34.643 --> 07:36.564
or else...

07:36.854 --> 07:39.296
it ends up bad for everyone.

07:41.075 --> 07:43.079
You have my word.

07:43.420 --> 07:45.437
Take care, Aniello.

07:54.079 --> 07:56.299
I know where it is.

07:57.787 --> 08:00.571
Okay, Giuseppe, see you in an hour.

08:00.883 --> 08:02.385
Yeah.

08:05.515 --> 08:08.288
You told your father I was here?

08:08.943 --> 08:11.536
My father's no fool,

08:12.511 --> 08:15.510
he knows by now you're living here.

08:26.410 --> 08:28.650
Besides this, there are hotels,

08:28.703 --> 08:30.860
restaurants, franchises...

08:31.205 --> 08:33.323
It took me 20 years to get here,

08:34.159 --> 08:36.255
to look down on the world.

08:40.303 --> 08:42.192
This is just the start,

08:42.245 --> 08:44.761
because Rome is our pasture.

08:45.901 --> 08:48.120
I know what you're saying.

08:48.970 --> 08:52.609
So it's time to decide
who the fuck you want to be.

08:53.186 --> 08:56.622
Thanks to your stuff too
we're building an empire here...

08:56.679 --> 08:58.478
me and you.

08:58.546 --> 09:01.633
Here you're Gennaro Savastano,
no longer Don Pietro's son,

09:01.688 --> 09:04.057
and you can be even bigger than him.

09:04.406 --> 09:06.450
That's the future.

09:07.943 --> 09:09.757
You already know the past.

09:09.820 --> 09:12.156
I need to know who
the fuck you want to be.

09:13.208 --> 09:15.312
I already made my choice,

09:15.919 --> 09:18.840
but I want to face that piece of shit,

09:18.904 --> 09:20.864
look him in the eyes,

09:20.948 --> 09:23.869
he's gotta see I'm still standing.

09:27.045 --> 09:29.889
I have to be sure
you won't pull any shit.

09:30.571 --> 09:33.741
If you touch Ciro Di Marzio,
they'll shoot you, got it?

09:34.740 --> 09:37.653
If that's your idea,
you'll come back feet first.

09:38.877 --> 09:41.520
I'll go and come back
on my own two feet.

09:42.156 --> 09:46.190
I look ahead, my future's
here in Rome with you.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.012
And with Azzurra.

09:54.179 --> 09:56.021
Great.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.695
It's all set up.

10:23.014 --> 10:26.054
The day after tomorrow, in Trieste,

10:26.398 --> 10:28.283
just him and me.

10:29.694 --> 10:33.083
You sit face-to-face with Gennarino.

10:33.390 --> 10:35.450
Ciro, it's your head,

10:35.511 --> 10:38.946
but if somethin' happens,
there'll be an earthquake here too.

10:38.999 --> 10:42.503
My head's going nowhere,
and the earth won't move either.

10:43.950 --> 10:45.999
Aniello Pastore guarantees,

10:46.051 --> 10:49.112
so do his allies,
and Giuseppe Avitabile.

10:49.460 --> 10:51.345
He can't touch me.

10:52.935 --> 10:55.996
Ciro, I don't understand all this.

10:56.051 --> 10:58.868
You're recognizing Savastano.

10:58.925 --> 11:02.583
- I'm talking to Gennaro, not Pietro.
- It's the same thing.

11:03.010 --> 11:05.908
If it was the same thing,
Gennaro would be here too.

11:06.966 --> 11:10.690
I need your trust,
I'm doing what's right.

11:13.599 --> 11:17.001
They accepted this meeting,
their hands are tied.

11:18.834 --> 11:20.999
We've already won.

11:34.496 --> 11:36.673
You didn't say a word!

11:37.742 --> 11:40.932
I gotta think before I talk.

11:43.037 --> 11:45.161
See you, TotÃ².

11:55.265 --> 11:57.309
This is it.

12:15.209 --> 12:17.174
Looks like a toy.

12:17.228 --> 12:19.518
This toy kills like a gun.

12:33.327 --> 12:35.731
They wanted to humiliate me.

12:36.363 --> 12:38.659
Like I don't count a fuck.

12:46.906 --> 12:50.323
I'd like to face that piece of shit.

12:52.111 --> 12:54.387
Father and son are the same thing.

12:54.445 --> 12:57.174
If so, I wouldn't be in this cesspit.

13:02.837 --> 13:05.136
Anything I should tell him?

13:40.642 --> 13:42.605
- Trak, is Genny here?
- Haven't seen him.

13:55.049 --> 13:56.862
I'll introduce my girlfriends.

13:57.906 --> 14:01.023
- Girls, this is Gennaro.
- Hi, Happy Birthday.

14:01.072 --> 14:03.458
- Alessandra, a pleasure.
- Veronica.

14:03.512 --> 14:05.011
A pleasure.

14:05.061 --> 14:06.863
He's not here!

14:08.660 --> 14:11.642
Wow, it's really great here!

14:11.681 --> 14:13.231
Is Genny here?

14:13.269 --> 14:14.321
Dunno.

14:14.363 --> 14:16.212
Where the fuck is he?

14:18.902 --> 14:20.527
Guys, this is his party.

14:20.582 --> 14:22.882
- A pleasure, Gennaro.
- Chiara.

14:22.943 --> 14:24.237
This is Francesca.

14:25.732 --> 14:27.906
Just a minute, love.

14:29.210 --> 14:30.668
Excuse me.

14:30.697 --> 14:33.064
- Happy Birthday, Genny.
- Thank you.

14:34.154 --> 14:36.365
- How's it goin', Little Bird?
- Happy Birthday!

14:36.406 --> 14:37.857
Come here.

14:39.479 --> 14:42.102
- Gennaro...
- How's things, Trak?

14:42.146 --> 14:44.641
- You're lookin' good.
- Oh, yeah?

14:44.699 --> 14:46.918
We're all scarred and
I'm missing a kidney.

14:46.991 --> 14:49.125
Come here, c'mon!

14:49.182 --> 14:51.828
Thanks for coming to my party.

14:52.866 --> 14:55.839
They hurt us, but we're still standing.

14:55.900 --> 14:58.657
But your shoes are more comfortable!

15:01.642 --> 15:03.349
Azzurra!

15:03.382 --> 15:05.534
- Behave, guys!
- Don't worry!

15:05.599 --> 15:09.071
Azzurra, these are my
best friends: Little Bird...

15:09.136 --> 15:11.577
- A pleasure, Carmine.
- Hi, Azzurra.

15:11.631 --> 15:14.004
- Bomber.
- A pleasure.

15:14.055 --> 15:15.803
The pleasure's mine.

15:15.849 --> 15:17.151
- And Trak.
- A pleasure.

15:17.241 --> 15:18.916
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

15:28.015 --> 15:32.668
Your girl's pretty, but how do
you fit in with these people?

15:37.319 --> 15:39.816
I fit in with her,
that's more than enough.

15:39.866 --> 15:43.894
A toast to our brother who grew up
and who's even settlin' down!

15:43.953 --> 15:45.888
To you, Gennaro.

15:45.954 --> 15:48.887
Mr. Savastano, there's
someone outside for you.

15:50.404 --> 15:52.637
Don't move!

16:01.412 --> 16:03.077
Gennaro!

16:14.282 --> 16:16.501
Who the fuck are you?

16:17.713 --> 16:20.083
My name's Patrizia,

16:20.132 --> 16:22.066
your father sends me.

16:22.121 --> 16:23.864
You?

16:23.907 --> 16:26.435
What's my father got to say to me?

16:26.490 --> 16:29.089
That he'd like to be in your shoes.

16:33.450 --> 16:37.261
So, you're givin' my father
your ears and mouth, huh?

16:38.536 --> 16:40.692
It seems strange.

16:42.897 --> 16:46.277
Especially since the last
woman he trusted is dead.

16:49.049 --> 16:51.077
That's how things are.

16:57.657 --> 16:59.969
This passes all the checks.

17:00.312 --> 17:02.439
Just one bullet.

17:20.954 --> 17:23.660
Doesn't he know the
clan's there to guarantee?

17:23.709 --> 17:26.912
If I try to kill him, they'll kill me?

17:27.838 --> 17:29.947
He says don't let him down.

17:35.143 --> 17:38.293
So, I gotta die to please my father?

17:39.970 --> 17:41.553
Huh?

17:45.387 --> 17:48.084
I gotta die to please my father?

17:48.145 --> 17:50.255
I'm just the messenger.

17:51.581 --> 17:54.701
They'll tell you what to do
when you're there.

18:02.375 --> 18:04.293
Messenger!

18:05.832 --> 18:08.877
Today's my birthday, did he forget?

18:09.421 --> 18:10.786
No,

18:11.131 --> 18:12.910
he sends you his best wishes.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.169
Don't move!

18:58.218 --> 19:00.961
Don't move, or it'll hurt more!

19:01.004 --> 19:02.554
Don't move!

19:11.153 --> 19:13.549
- Gennaro!
- Where are you going?

19:13.600 --> 19:16.022
We're bored. Where did you go?

19:16.099 --> 19:19.485
- Brother, things okay?
- Yeah, let's take a ride.

19:19.567 --> 19:22.377
- Now that you're in Rome...
- And your party?

19:22.421 --> 19:24.265
You're my party!

19:24.330 --> 19:27.520
I want a joint, pull out the weed!

19:27.564 --> 19:30.887
- You're such an imbecile!
- Idiot!

19:30.939 --> 19:33.427
It's your party, Genny!

19:42.258 --> 19:45.266
Gennaro, our life's shit since you left.

19:45.300 --> 19:48.966
The secessionists have blocked us
in that alley, like monkeys.

19:49.019 --> 19:50.990
They toss us peanuts.

19:51.311 --> 19:54.579
We didn't even sell two
hundred units last month.

19:54.638 --> 19:56.569
We live on handouts.

19:57.290 --> 20:00.804
They're makin' tons and
think they own the world.

20:01.199 --> 20:05.280
Got it? You should see that shit
Ciro Di Marzio actin' the big man!

20:05.653 --> 20:09.280
Genny, they say your
father's back in Naples,

20:09.337 --> 20:10.906
is it true?

20:14.519 --> 20:17.685
- Yeah, Trak.
- Why don't you bust Ciro's ass?

20:17.746 --> 20:19.669
Why don't you come back too?

20:19.721 --> 20:22.662
- It's no time.
- What the fuck's that mean?

20:22.724 --> 20:26.841
He gets stronger every day.
He almost killed us all.

20:28.396 --> 20:31.482
Who knows how we're still alive.

20:33.480 --> 20:35.126
Gennaro!

20:36.631 --> 20:39.772
And don't forget he killed your mother.

20:40.798 --> 20:43.281
I said it's not time.

20:43.336 --> 20:45.188
Where are you going?

20:46.075 --> 20:47.761
Azzurra!

20:57.435 --> 20:59.085
Who?

21:14.561 --> 21:16.562
Who the fuck was it?

21:18.443 --> 21:20.524
It was me.

21:21.390 --> 21:25.541
So what? I just stole
a rich guy's watch.

21:27.291 --> 21:29.091
No,

21:29.130 --> 21:31.287
you came and stole in my house.

21:32.247 --> 21:35.778
He's got more money than you,
he can buy another one.

21:35.815 --> 21:38.349
Meantime I can make 1000 Euros.

21:38.740 --> 21:41.300
While you find the courage to come back,

21:42.207 --> 21:45.122
I brought justice to the world.

21:45.471 --> 21:47.268
Nice, huh?

21:47.561 --> 21:49.178
Gennaro!

21:49.897 --> 21:52.391
Have you lost your mind?

21:52.755 --> 21:54.933
Calm down, calm down!

22:00.958 --> 22:02.491
Trak,

22:02.525 --> 22:04.080
get up.

22:05.677 --> 22:08.212
Gennaro, where are you goin'? Come back!

22:08.251 --> 22:09.766
Calm down!

22:09.819 --> 22:11.637
- No balls, Gennaro!
- Calm down, Trak!

22:11.679 --> 22:13.657
- You got no balls!
- Calm down!

22:13.691 --> 22:16.047
- Gennaro!
- Calm down!

22:16.398 --> 22:18.676
You got no balls!

22:20.568 --> 22:22.712
You got no balls!

22:24.847 --> 22:26.726
You got no balls!

22:54.107 --> 22:55.568
Hi.

22:56.493 --> 22:58.088
Hi, Azzurra.

23:05.861 --> 23:08.300
Nothing to say?

23:15.032 --> 23:17.994
That was your party, not mine.

23:19.198 --> 23:21.979
Besides I already apologized, didn't I?

23:43.827 --> 23:45.805
What's that?

23:48.629 --> 23:50.535
A present from my father.

23:53.862 --> 23:55.919
What's going on, Gennaro?

24:00.182 --> 24:02.602
Nothing, Azzurra, don't worry.

24:03.361 --> 24:05.782
By the way, I'm leaving tonight.

24:44.181 --> 24:45.819
Gennaro!

24:46.490 --> 24:48.952
Gabriele, things okay?

24:49.317 --> 24:50.945
Just fine.

24:50.972 --> 24:53.081
Wow, you're looking great!

24:54.005 --> 24:56.156
I hear you're coming up in the world.

24:56.211 --> 24:57.754
Yeah.

25:00.841 --> 25:02.942
You wanted to see me?

25:06.445 --> 25:08.743
We gotta talk business.

25:10.597 --> 25:14.686
There's this fuckin' meeting,
who knows how it'll end up.

25:20.567 --> 25:23.238
Maybe only one will come back...

25:28.535 --> 25:30.338
or no one.

25:33.281 --> 25:36.063
Buy however it goes, you can win.

25:37.520 --> 25:39.634
Interested?

25:47.517 --> 25:49.737
I'm a business man.

25:59.689 --> 26:02.427
I'll be gone just one day.

26:05.563 --> 26:07.597
I don't want to stay here alone.

26:09.522 --> 26:11.656
You're not alone.

26:12.686 --> 26:15.182
There's the lady, the guys...

26:15.224 --> 26:17.422
Alone, without you, in this house...

26:18.674 --> 26:21.175
What's wrong with this house?

26:21.532 --> 26:24.686
- We chose it together.
- It doesn't feel like ours.

26:24.740 --> 26:27.432
In the other, it was like
Mom was still there.

26:32.297 --> 26:33.867
Come here.

26:33.921 --> 26:35.418
C'mon.

26:39.494 --> 26:43.042
It takes time, we just
have to get used to it.

26:44.537 --> 26:46.722
Can we make peace?

26:47.734 --> 26:49.837
C'mon, give me a kiss!

27:07.604 --> 27:10.013
Dad will be back soon.

27:15.170 --> 27:16.745
What are you doing?

27:17.914 --> 27:19.820
Can't you see?

27:26.033 --> 27:27.984
Where is it?

27:28.943 --> 27:30.642
In there.

27:31.313 --> 27:33.528
Isn't that okay?

27:45.899 --> 27:48.081
I could have given it to my father,

27:49.414 --> 27:52.268
but you know what you have to do.

28:08.654 --> 28:11.184
Remember what you've got here.

28:32.351 --> 28:33.705
This way, Don Ciro!

28:55.771 --> 28:57.547
Please get in.

29:43.975 --> 29:45.466
Don Ciro,

29:45.805 --> 29:47.506
welcome.

29:50.628 --> 29:51.951
Raffaele.

29:53.523 --> 29:57.241
Don Aniello sent me,
I'm at your total disposal.

29:57.874 --> 29:59.854
I've taken care of everything.

30:00.224 --> 30:02.146
Room 621, sixth floor.

30:03.048 --> 30:04.742
I'll take you up.

30:29.713 --> 30:31.744
- Hello?
- He's in the Savoia.

30:31.795 --> 30:34.171
Room 621, one kilometer from your hotel.

30:34.240 --> 30:36.593
In your room there's
a sack with everything.

31:26.073 --> 31:28.593
Come in, Don Gennaro,
make yourself comfortable.

31:30.703 --> 31:32.975
Anything you need, we're downstairs.

31:33.596 --> 31:35.331
Okay.

31:35.981 --> 31:37.915
I'll order dinner and get to bed.

31:37.986 --> 31:41.044
- At your disposal. Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Pasquale.

32:09.349 --> 32:11.040
Sweetheart,

32:11.624 --> 32:13.825
how come you're still awake?

32:17.051 --> 32:19.400
Tomorrow's almost here.

32:20.294 --> 32:22.987
When you wake up,
Dad will already be home.

32:25.600 --> 32:27.517
I miss you too.

32:31.393 --> 32:33.327
I love you.

32:34.211 --> 32:35.731
Bye.

33:42.017 --> 33:44.605
I need some air.

37:14.725 --> 37:16.244
Where's the hotel?

37:17.123 --> 37:18.530
That way, Don Ciro.

37:22.596 --> 37:24.364
Let's go back.

38:16.695 --> 38:19.631
Don Ciro, we'll call you
tomorrow morning.

38:19.692 --> 38:21.836
Whatever you need, we're downstairs.

39:58.194 --> 40:00.136
Shoot, if you have to,

40:01.361 --> 40:03.626
so we can end it.

40:05.521 --> 40:08.863
I waited all this time
and you want it over fast?

40:10.976 --> 40:12.964
Turn around, you rat.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.073
Death's been next to me all my life,

40:39.956 --> 40:41.769
I'm not scared of dying.

40:41.827 --> 40:43.249
Oh, yeah?

40:43.478 --> 40:46.679
That's why you killed my mother
and shot me in the face?

40:53.894 --> 40:56.239
With these hands,

40:56.289 --> 40:58.431
I killed my Debora.

41:00.482 --> 41:03.201
I'd have killed anyone
who got in the way.

41:10.086 --> 41:12.301
Kill this piece of shit!

41:18.973 --> 41:22.201
What did you tell your daughter
about her mother's death?

41:22.598 --> 41:24.694
I'm not telling you that.

41:25.623 --> 41:28.256
Shoot, I've had it.

41:28.622 --> 41:31.108
- You can lie to yourself, not me.
- Shoot!

41:31.153 --> 41:33.392
You can't forget you killed
your daughter's mother.

41:33.436 --> 41:35.124
Shoot!

41:35.498 --> 41:37.424
On your knees!

41:46.586 --> 41:49.019
I like seeing you like this...

41:51.990 --> 41:54.748
as if asking for forgiveness,

41:55.697 --> 41:57.829
asking for peace.

42:00.475 --> 42:03.728
But there's no peace
or forgiveness for you.

42:03.735 --> 42:23.559
T:U:S:U:B:T:I:T:U:L:O:

42:28.559 --> 42:30.496
You keep it,

42:31.668 --> 42:35.733
so you'll remember the day I could
have killed you, but didn't.

43:21.473 --> 43:23.210
Immortal!

43:26.186 --> 43:28.330
Hello, Don Aniello.

43:32.004 --> 43:34.328
Did you have a good night?

43:34.373 --> 43:35.969
Perfect.

44:18.537 --> 44:20.382
Gennaro,

44:20.451 --> 44:22.370
the past is over.

44:22.708 --> 44:24.710
Now we go forward,

44:24.768 --> 44:27.567
in everybody's interest, yours too.

44:29.106 --> 44:30.923
What Ciro proposes

44:32.144 --> 44:34.091
sounds reasonable to me.

44:35.940 --> 44:38.633
I decide if it's reasonable or not.

44:44.317 --> 44:47.499
For me Pietro Savastano
can stay where he is.

44:48.757 --> 44:50.863
On two conditions:

44:51.536 --> 44:54.434
first, the alliance buys your stuff,

44:56.560 --> 44:58.491
so you'll see

44:58.834 --> 45:01.255
you'll make more money with this peace.

45:03.067 --> 45:05.654
War's not worth it to anyone.

45:09.060 --> 45:10.562
Okay,

45:11.140 --> 45:13.598
I don't care where the money's from,

45:14.540 --> 45:18.237
and I don't give a fuck about
what happens in Naples anymore.

45:18.654 --> 45:20.385
Good.

45:23.553 --> 45:26.822
That means the second
condition's not a problem.

45:30.428 --> 45:32.778
Your father, his men,

45:33.960 --> 45:37.058
can't leave their neighbourhood anymore.

45:48.893 --> 45:50.936
Okay.

45:53.728 --> 45:55.704
Goodbye, Don Aniello.

46:58.301 --> 47:00.155
- What the fuck...?
- You can't leave.

47:00.192 --> 47:01.413
Out of my way!

47:01.471 --> 47:04.729
Rules have changed, there's an
agreement with Gennaro Savastano.

47:05.913 --> 47:07.361
What the fuck do you mean?

47:07.405 --> 47:10.613
You can do what you like
in your house, even sell stuff,

47:10.673 --> 47:14.191
but none of your men can go out, got it?

47:14.255 --> 47:16.840
Gennarino guarantees for all of you.

47:32.035 --> 47:34.460
He sold me out.

47:38.562 --> 47:41.350
He didn't kill him and he sold me out.

47:41.695 --> 47:43.554
Piece of shit!

47:44.215 --> 47:46.530
Calm down, they can hear you.

47:46.581 --> 47:49.259
- There must be a reason.
- I gotta get out.

47:49.298 --> 47:53.176
Get me out of here,
I gotta look him in the face!

49:24.920 --> 49:26.379
Hi.

49:26.445 --> 49:27.943
Hi.

49:36.872 --> 49:39.222
I'm happy you're here.

49:41.110 --> 49:43.585
I don't know how I feel,

49:44.417 --> 49:46.439
but now I'm just fine.

49:48.727 --> 49:51.871
Now we'll see if you like
your birthday present!

49:54.582 --> 49:57.182
- Want to see it?
- Yes.

50:05.414 --> 50:06.873
Here.

50:27.582 --> 50:29.611
Congratulations, my love.

50:30.876 --> 50:32.210
To both of us.
