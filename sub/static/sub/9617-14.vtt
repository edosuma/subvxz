00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
♪♪

00:12.079 --> 00:13.746
I'm better than you now.

00:13.748 --> 00:15.314
I am riley,
the artist,

00:15.316 --> 00:17.549
And you are maya,
the artist's best friend.

00:20.755 --> 00:23.522
Thank you for working
on light and shadow, maya.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.624
Yeah, i look
around outside now.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.426
I watch the light
move during the day.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.661
Thanks for teaching
me that, ms. Kossal.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.198
Hey. Are you okay?

00:33.934 --> 00:37.336
I get emotional
when i'm around talent.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.940
And now i'm fine.

00:44.278 --> 00:45.978
Come on!

00:45.979 --> 00:47.679
What did i tell you
about only using purple?

00:47.681 --> 00:50.315
-Are we gonna do this again?
-Why is everything purple?

00:50.317 --> 00:53.352
Because you hide the purple
from me and i find it!

00:53.354 --> 00:54.753
Are you finger painting?

00:54.755 --> 00:56.955
I believe you favor
maya over me.

00:56.957 --> 00:57.990
Oh, yeah?

00:57.992 --> 00:59.858
Well, let's explore that.

00:59.860 --> 01:02.528
Let's see if i have
unfairly judged you.

01:02.530 --> 01:03.996
-Today's assignment...
-Uh-huh.

01:03.998 --> 01:05.731
-...Was the doorways
of new york.
-Yep. Yep.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.966
You were asked
to specifically focus on...

01:07.968 --> 01:10.235
Unique doorknobs.
Uh-huh. Yeah.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.603
-...And paint it from memory.
-I did.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.906
You painted a cat.

01:13.908 --> 01:14.940
-It's a door.
-It's a cat.

01:14.942 --> 01:16.809
The whole thing's a door.

01:16.811 --> 01:18.811
Anybody home?

01:18.813 --> 01:21.280
Okay, i'll come back later.

01:21.282 --> 01:22.347
Don't let the cat out.

01:24.518 --> 01:28.320
Maya has something
very special, riley.

01:28.322 --> 01:30.889
She paints from a place
that few of us are
able to reach.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.424
That's because
she has an awful life.

01:32.426 --> 01:33.759
I love it
when i'm reminded.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.994
Take a look at maya's work.

01:37.298 --> 01:38.864
I want to know
what's behind that door.

01:38.866 --> 01:40.399
So does the artist...

01:40.401 --> 01:43.702
Because i think it's been
closed to her up until now.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.270
I'm gonna get you
in that door, maya.

01:45.272 --> 01:46.705
Oh, i know you are, riley.

01:46.707 --> 01:49.374
Good. Because
it's maya's last painting.

01:51.412 --> 01:53.612
W-wait, why is
it my last painting?

01:53.614 --> 01:56.682
Well, it's your last one
for me, you beautiful girl.

01:56.684 --> 01:58.350
What's going on?

01:59.987 --> 02:02.321
Our school is
running out of money.

02:02.323 --> 02:04.423
They're cutting art
and music classes,

02:04.425 --> 02:06.024
Effective after
the next school board meeting.

02:06.026 --> 02:07.659
What?

02:07.660 --> 02:09.293
How will maya learn?
What comes after
light and shadow?

02:09.296 --> 02:10.329
What about you, riley?

02:10.331 --> 02:12.364
Who cares about me?
I stink.

02:12.366 --> 02:13.332
What about maya?

02:13.334 --> 02:14.834
And what about drama?

02:14.835 --> 02:16.335
My one-year suspension
from not being able to audition

02:16.337 --> 02:17.970
For any of the plays
ends on tuesday.

02:17.972 --> 02:19.838
-I'm gonna be pippin!
-They're not putting on <i> pippin.</i>

02:19.840 --> 02:21.507
I'm gonna be pippin
in whatever they're doing.

02:22.610 --> 02:24.476
Nobody better cut my ballet.

02:26.347 --> 02:27.880
Yeah, that's right--
ballet.

02:27.882 --> 02:30.048
That's why i'm so sinewy.

02:30.050 --> 02:31.717
Sinewy?

02:31.718 --> 02:33.385
Hey, you spend your time
hitting baseballs,

02:33.387 --> 02:35.454
I spend my time
lifting beautiful girls.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.623
Ms. Hart?

02:37.625 --> 02:39.491
Shall we dance?

02:40.794 --> 02:41.927
We shall not.

02:43.330 --> 02:44.730
Ballet-- gone.

02:44.732 --> 02:46.331
Art, music...

02:46.333 --> 02:49.001
Drama, dance, all of it--

02:49.003 --> 02:50.469
Gone.

02:57.878 --> 02:58.911
Maya?

02:58.913 --> 03:01.413
It's okay, riles.

03:01.415 --> 03:03.048
Just another door closed.

04:01.875 --> 04:04.142
The dark ages--

04:04.143 --> 04:06.410
They're cutting art class
and you want to talk
about the dark ages?

04:06.413 --> 04:09.715
The dark ages was a time
of cultural deterioration.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.583
What does that
have to do with me?

04:11.585 --> 04:14.953
The dark ages was the decline
of the creative spirit

04:14.955 --> 04:16.555
Of an entire continent.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.090
What about me?

04:19.026 --> 04:20.993
The dark ages is when
they cut the art class

04:20.995 --> 04:22.961
At this middle school
right now.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.863
And you, maya hart--
yes, you, maya hart,

04:24.865 --> 04:26.131
The one i'm looking
at right here--

04:26.133 --> 04:28.066
Can't paint anymore.

04:28.068 --> 04:30.602
You know, a good teacher
lets the students get there
on their own.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.574
Daddy?

04:35.575 --> 04:37.575
Riley, if you put
another purple cat

04:37.578 --> 04:39.911
On our fridge, i swear
i'm moving to brooklyn.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.614
Scratch my nose.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.117
I won't be dry until math,
and mrs. Kravitz scratches

04:45.119 --> 04:47.486
My nose like
she doesn't want to.

04:51.859 --> 04:54.092
That's like a daddy would.

04:54.094 --> 04:55.594
So...

04:55.596 --> 04:57.496
Why were the dark ages
dark, pippin?

04:57.498 --> 04:58.797
People lost interest
in art and music

04:58.799 --> 04:59.998
Because it was
taken away from them.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.800
Well, i don't
want that for maya.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.669
I want maya to be happy.

05:05.539 --> 05:07.606
Hey, maya, it looks like
lucas here's gettin' all

05:07.608 --> 05:09.007
Fired up on your behalf.

05:09.009 --> 05:12.511
Thank you, lucas.
But it's just an art class.

05:12.513 --> 05:13.862
I feel bad.

05:13.863 --> 05:15.212
They're taking away
something you're very good at.

05:15.215 --> 05:17.749
-You've never said
that to me before.
-I've said it.

05:17.751 --> 05:19.985
Yeah, but not, like
straight to my face
when you were looking at me.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.554
-I can't remember
you actually l--
-you're a great artist, maya.

05:23.590 --> 05:26.692
Well, he lookin' at you now.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.627
You have a real talent.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.929
And want you to
be able to get better
and share it with people.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.500
Now they're just
lookin' at each other
and not sayin' nothin'.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.035
Are they saying anything?

05:37.037 --> 05:38.604
No?

05:38.605 --> 05:40.172
Well, i wonder
that they're thinkin'.

05:41.608 --> 05:43.742
I don't want them to
take away your art class, maya.

05:44.978 --> 05:46.011
Bay window!

05:46.013 --> 05:48.814
Bay window right in five hours.

05:50.250 --> 05:51.883
Okay.

05:51.884 --> 05:53.517
Who's gonna do something
about art class?

05:53.520 --> 05:55.654
-I'm sure that'll be riley.
-Nope.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.723
Well, i know you guys
would like me to step in here--

05:57.725 --> 05:58.857
Nope.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.058
This is bigger than you, dad.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.194
You're right. This is.

06:02.196 --> 06:04.896
In fact, this decision
comes directly from

06:04.898 --> 06:06.298
The new york city school board.

06:06.300 --> 06:08.166
That's not
what i'm talking about.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.102
If they're gonna
put us in the dark ages,

06:10.104 --> 06:11.670
Then who's gonna get us out?

06:11.672 --> 06:13.538
Ah.

06:13.540 --> 06:14.873
Funny thing about that.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.308
You know who did get us out?

06:16.310 --> 06:18.910
-Artists.
-Ah.

06:18.912 --> 06:22.547
Michaelangelo, da vinci...
There was an explosion

06:22.549 --> 06:24.683
Of creativity
called the renaissance.

06:25.786 --> 06:28.120
Maya, i would think
you'd have something
to say about that.

06:28.122 --> 06:30.722
Cut the art classes,
don't cut the art classes.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.724
What have i ever been
able to do about my life?

06:32.726 --> 06:34.693
And now my little
purple friend will go crazy.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.695
Not this time, maya.

06:36.697 --> 06:39.331
You're the artist, and i'm just
the artist's best friend.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.576
You think
you're gonna outlast me?

06:51.578 --> 06:53.111
You think
i'm gonna do something?

06:53.113 --> 06:55.347
You think i'd actually
care about something?

06:55.349 --> 06:57.048
I don't care
what you care about.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.121
You're gonna break first,
and you're gonna fix

07:02.122 --> 07:04.156
This whole thing somehow
because you can't help yourself!

07:04.158 --> 07:05.824
You know, for somebody
who doesn't care,

07:05.826 --> 07:08.693
You are most certainly
talking to me in all caps.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.596
I will never be a great artist.

07:11.598 --> 07:12.697
You're probably right.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.767
You don't believe in me?

07:15.769 --> 07:17.269
Not if you won't.

07:17.271 --> 07:19.271
Well, i can't, riley.
You know?

07:19.273 --> 07:21.640
It's just 'cause
don't believe, don't get hurt.

07:21.642 --> 07:22.874
Yeah.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.676
Yeah, you're probably right.
Be safe.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.778
You're right, i'm wrong.
Be safe.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.814
Let's just go to a movie
or read a book

07:28.816 --> 07:30.749
Or maybe listen
to some music.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.885
You mean let's just go to art,
or read some art,

07:33.887 --> 07:36.188
Or listen to some art,
because movies and books

07:36.190 --> 07:37.322
And music are art?

07:37.324 --> 07:38.657
I do go outside, riley.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.826
I watch the light
move during the day.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.160
And you know
what happens at 5:30?

07:42.162 --> 07:43.979
You turn gold.

07:43.980 --> 07:45.797
Everything is more beautiful
at the beginning
and the end of the day,

07:45.799 --> 07:46.798
And i want people to see that.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.300
I want to capture that.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.703
I didn't mean to
believe in something.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.638
I know you didn't, peaches.

07:55.409 --> 07:56.708
But i do.

07:57.644 --> 07:58.977
And you knew it.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.312
You knew this was in me.

08:00.314 --> 08:01.646
-Mm-hmm.
-You did it.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.148
You broke me.
I broke first.

08:03.149 --> 08:04.649
This is the first time
this has ever happened!

08:05.819 --> 08:07.052
How close were you to breaking?

08:07.054 --> 08:08.820
I almost died!

08:10.157 --> 08:12.123
I'm so proud of you.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.191
Me too, you!

08:13.193 --> 08:15.393
Something is finally
important to you.

08:15.395 --> 08:17.395
-Yeah.
-How come?

08:17.397 --> 08:19.664
Because i don't want
to live in a world
of stupid purple cats!

08:19.666 --> 08:21.066
No, wait. What?

08:22.703 --> 08:24.002
We need a plan.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.170
You got a plan?

08:25.172 --> 08:27.205
Do i have a plan?

08:27.207 --> 08:29.808
Gee, i only have
about nine of them.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.409
And each plan
has a little sub-plan

08:31.411 --> 08:34.079
And each sub-plan
has a little baby plan.

08:34.081 --> 08:36.681
Do i have a plan?

08:36.683 --> 08:38.850
'kay. What's your plan?

08:40.087 --> 08:41.152
Mommy!

08:41.154 --> 08:43.188
What's our plan?

08:43.190 --> 08:44.940
I'm sorry, girls.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.691
I can't wave a magical
lawyer wand this time.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.326
The schools only get
so much money every year.

08:48.328 --> 08:49.878
It's not a legal issue.

08:49.879 --> 08:51.429
They can spend it
on whatever they see fit.

08:51.431 --> 08:53.431
Are you telling us to give up?

08:53.433 --> 08:55.700
Would i ever tell
you to do that?

08:56.703 --> 08:57.736
No.

08:57.738 --> 08:58.937
So, what are you telling us?

08:58.939 --> 09:00.038
You have an opponent.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.873
Your opponent
is thinking logically.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.876
If you think logically,
you're gonna lose
the creative arts.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.211
Okay, but are they right?

09:06.213 --> 09:08.179
Are academics so much
more valuable than the arts

09:08.181 --> 09:09.714
That we should just
let them do this to us?

09:10.984 --> 09:12.350
Do you guys like it?

09:12.352 --> 09:14.052
I do, auggie.
I love it.

09:15.122 --> 09:17.088
No one should
take it away from you.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.357
Someone's going to
take it away from me?

09:19.359 --> 09:20.892
No.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.294
Let's get 'em.

09:22.296 --> 09:23.895
Let's get 'em.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.463
(screaming)

09:31.238 --> 09:34.372
Maya, i'm really proud of you
for deciding to do something

09:34.374 --> 09:35.740
About your future.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.378
You guys left me
out there to die.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.023
You brought me here
to watch this?

09:52.025 --> 09:53.892
Enjoying the show,
uncle jonathan?

09:53.894 --> 09:56.027
No, i'm not.
Matthews, why am i here?

09:56.029 --> 09:57.529
It was my idea.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.030
If you're gonna do this,
then you should watch it happen.

09:59.032 --> 10:01.166
Cory, why would you
tell them i'm doing this?

10:01.168 --> 10:04.369
Because you're a bad,
bad man, and i love it

10:04.371 --> 10:06.404
When it's
somebody else's fault.

10:06.406 --> 10:07.839
What are they gonna do
with the art room

10:07.841 --> 10:09.007
That's more important than art?

10:09.009 --> 10:11.009
This will be
a test taking class.

10:11.011 --> 10:13.011
We need to be tested
on how to take a test?

10:13.013 --> 10:14.446
We're testing it out.

10:14.448 --> 10:15.814
Why do you hate art so much?

10:15.816 --> 10:17.282
Matthews!

10:17.284 --> 10:19.918
Girls, i am not for this.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.052
What?

10:21.054 --> 10:22.787
My hands are tied.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.789
I'm the superintendent
of schools.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.359
I answer to the panel
for educational policy.

10:27.361 --> 10:29.527
I mean, all this,
it comes from them.

10:29.529 --> 10:31.262
I'm not the enemy here.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.330
Yes, he is.

10:32.332 --> 10:33.798
Matthews!

10:33.800 --> 10:34.799
Turner!

10:36.436 --> 10:38.169
You wouldn't get rid of this?

10:39.539 --> 10:41.139
Ah, i'd get rid
of that forever.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.211
But that's a real loss.

10:56.857 --> 10:59.524
Well, you are harder
to watch than usual.

10:59.526 --> 11:02.861
I mean, all broken
and pouty and stuff.

11:03.864 --> 11:06.831
Lucas used to
call me in texas
and tell me about you guys.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.099
You were legends.

11:08.101 --> 11:11.236
The genius
who's loyal and kind...

11:11.238 --> 11:12.904
The blond beauty...

11:12.906 --> 11:14.572
Lucas talks
about himself like that?

11:16.009 --> 11:17.375
He was talking about you.

11:17.377 --> 11:18.843
Oh.

11:21.314 --> 11:22.230
Oh...

11:22.231 --> 11:23.147
He said you were
all full of fire.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.384
And the pretty brunette
who never gives up

11:26.386 --> 11:27.852
On anyone or anything.

11:27.854 --> 11:30.055
And no sacrifice
is too big for her friends.

11:30.057 --> 11:31.556
But you've all given up.

11:31.558 --> 11:33.158
Where's the fire?

11:33.160 --> 11:34.893
Because i don't
see any of it.

11:34.895 --> 11:36.161
You know what, lucas?

11:36.163 --> 11:38.246
These aren't the people
you told me about.

11:38.247 --> 11:40.330
Yeah, except you've been here
long enough to know
that they are.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.536
Einstein said we cannot
solve our problems

11:44.538 --> 11:46.905
With the same thinking
we used when we created them.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.606
Yeah. We need
a different kind of thinking.

11:48.608 --> 11:50.108
Well, what's
another way to think?

11:50.110 --> 11:52.477
We're trying to
save the creative arts.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.546
Why can't we start
thinking creatively?

11:56.016 --> 11:57.982
There's my little artist.

12:03.256 --> 12:07.659
I'm asking you to slow down
before this vote becomes final.

12:07.661 --> 12:10.061
Once these cuts
are official, then art

12:10.063 --> 12:14.065
And music and drama
and dance-- they're gone.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.134
I mean, is that
really acceptable?

12:17.337 --> 12:20.038
It's not too late
to do the right thing here.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.073
Thank you,
chairperson sanchez.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.575
Thank you,
superintendent turner.

12:23.577 --> 12:26.444
That was a lovely,
impassioned speech.

12:26.446 --> 12:28.680
Let me just check
and see if it changed
any of the numbers.

12:28.682 --> 12:31.483
No. I'm afraid not.

12:32.919 --> 12:35.653
Our next speaker
is mr. Isaiah babineaux.

12:35.655 --> 12:36.921
Mr. Babineaux?

12:41.094 --> 12:43.394
Hello, chairperson.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.964
Thank you for seeing me.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.999
You're welcome, mr. Babineaux.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.033
We are happy to see
a young representative

12:50.036 --> 12:52.437
Of our school community,
who is, i trust,

12:52.439 --> 12:55.707
Going to address us
with great respect
for our process.

12:55.709 --> 12:58.409
No. That's not
what's gonna happen.

13:01.348 --> 13:03.381
We couldn't reach you
with logic,

13:03.383 --> 13:06.651
So we decided
to think... Differently.

13:06.653 --> 13:09.420
Oh. Super.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.396
Okay. Wait a second.

The same thing
you're doing to us.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.627
Not as interesting
a room anymore.

13:52.032 --> 13:53.014
Get the picture?

13:53.015 --> 13:53.997
That's a very colorful
scarf you're wearing.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.600
-Thank you.
-May i?

13:58.538 --> 14:01.706
A dance to the loss of purple.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.364
My name is maya hart.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.132
This committee relies
on charts and graphs.

14:28.134 --> 14:29.500
I have information
to add to them.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.169
Please share it
with us, ms. Hart.

14:31.171 --> 14:33.238
You want numbers?

14:33.239 --> 14:35.306
The united states ranking
in math, science and reading

14:35.308 --> 14:37.508
Has done nothing
but drop for the past 50 years.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.277
-Your proposal?
-Get rid of 'em.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.613
Cut math,
science and reading?

14:41.615 --> 14:43.715
Why not? We stink at 'em.

14:43.717 --> 14:46.050
But you know what
we're number one at?

14:46.052 --> 14:48.086
Movies and music!

14:48.088 --> 14:51.222
People all over the world
are inspired by our creativity.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.690
But hey, i don't wanna
get rid of anything.

14:52.692 --> 14:53.725
You started it.

14:53.727 --> 14:55.126
My hands are tied.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.828
Yeah, it's so funny.

14:56.829 --> 14:58.529
Everyone keeps saying that,
but they're not.

14:58.531 --> 15:00.665
Look at 'em.
Your hands are free.
You just think they're tied.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.600
I'm afraid you're out of time.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.435
We have a long list
of speakers on the list today

15:04.437 --> 15:05.837
And we need to be
getting back to them.

15:05.839 --> 15:07.171
Topanga matthews.

15:11.144 --> 15:12.377
(clears throat)

15:13.613 --> 15:16.180
I yield my time
to these children.

15:18.485 --> 15:20.451
Uh... Cory matthews.

15:20.453 --> 15:21.853
Yield.

15:21.855 --> 15:23.321
Gabriella kossal.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.422
Yield.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.824
Yes. Super. Okay.

15:26.826 --> 15:29.827
Wouldn't now be a good time
for an adult point-of-view?

15:29.829 --> 15:32.230
-Adults: Yield.
-Oh, come on!

15:32.232 --> 15:33.698
The adults have failed them.

15:33.700 --> 15:37.368
Especially
superintendent turner!

15:37.370 --> 15:39.470
Matthews!

15:50.283 --> 15:52.717
We are also told that
you have great creativity.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.786
Why, yes.
I sing and dance

15:54.788 --> 15:56.654
And am the greatest pippin
the stage has ever seen.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.289
I love <i> pippin.</i>

16:00.126 --> 16:01.476
May we see some of it, please?

16:01.477 --> 16:02.827
No, you may not!
There are no longer plays

16:02.829 --> 16:04.979
Or concerts in this school.

16:04.980 --> 16:07.130
Instead, i shall perform for you
<i>a list of prime numbers.</i>

16:07.133 --> 16:09.133
Oh, that's disappointing.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.170

-13.

16:23.717 --> 16:25.300
Crowd:
Boo!

16:25.301 --> 16:26.884
Okay, okay. I think we get
your point, mr. Farkle.

16:26.886 --> 16:28.820
With all due respect,
chairperson sanchez,

16:28.822 --> 16:30.238
I don't think you do.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.655
And like i said,
i can also do this.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.226
(cheering and applause)

16:37.697 --> 16:39.230
-17.
-(crowd groans)

16:39.232 --> 16:40.298

16:41.501 --> 16:43.568
-23.
-Boo!

16:43.570 --> 16:46.304
I hate 23.

16:46.306 --> 16:47.839
Let's get 'em!

16:50.377 --> 16:52.176
(cheering and applause)

16:53.680 --> 16:55.947
Crowd:
Boo!

16:55.948 --> 16:58.215
Creativity feeds science,
and science feeds creativity.

16:58.218 --> 16:59.650
That's what you're missing
because you're not

16:59.652 --> 17:01.786
Thinking creatively.
Thank you.

17:07.560 --> 17:10.361
I took all of my art
off of the refrigerator.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.496
Do you have kids?

17:11.498 --> 17:16.734
When you get home,
please take their art
off of the refrigerator, too.

17:16.736 --> 17:19.637
Otherwise you're hippopotamuses.

17:19.639 --> 17:21.539
Hypocrites?

17:21.541 --> 17:23.408
Please don't cut reading.

17:26.246 --> 17:29.347
A dance in which
a hippopotamus returns home

17:29.349 --> 17:32.750
To find his art taken
from the refrigerator.

17:36.689 --> 17:39.857
Ahh, ooh, mmm...

17:51.337 --> 17:54.405
Ms. Hart, i am told
that you can sing.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.873
I can warble a tune.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.408
Would you do us
the great honor?

18:14.861 --> 18:16.594
Yoink.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.430
Sorry. No more music.

18:20.667 --> 18:24.368
Chairperson sanchez,
with respect,
you seem uncomfortable.

18:24.370 --> 18:26.971
Could that possibly
have to do with your background?

18:26.973 --> 18:29.474
I'm sure i have no idea
what you're talking about.

18:29.476 --> 18:31.442
Oh, let me be more specific.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.411
Where did you do
your undergraduate work?

18:33.413 --> 18:34.612
Princeton.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.347
Oh. Good school.
Good school.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.449
What'd you study?

18:38.451 --> 18:41.452
I don't see how
these questions are relevant
to today's proceedings.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.454
Oh, you were an art major!

18:43.456 --> 18:44.489
(crowd gasps)

18:44.491 --> 18:46.057
Yes, mr. Babineaux.

18:46.059 --> 18:48.292
I have a degree in studio art.

18:48.294 --> 18:50.628
A dance in which i graduate

18:50.630 --> 18:53.464
With a degree in studio art
from princeton university

18:53.466 --> 18:56.767
But then i get my hands tied.

18:56.769 --> 18:58.870
I don't need to see that one.
I lived it.

18:58.872 --> 19:01.405
-Does it hurt a little?
-It does.

19:01.407 --> 19:05.510
Especially since
one of the paintings
you took down was mine.

19:05.512 --> 19:08.045
Chairperson sanchez,
got a favorite book?

19:08.047 --> 19:10.348
-<i> Bridge to terabithia.</i>
-Un-read it.

19:10.350 --> 19:11.850
Favorite movie?

19:11.851 --> 19:13.351
<i>-The wizard of oz.</i>
-Un-watch it.

19:13.353 --> 19:16.454
Well, you've just kinda
taken away my whole
childhood, haven't you?

19:16.456 --> 19:17.788
When does it happen?

19:17.790 --> 19:19.590
When does what happen?

19:19.591 --> 19:21.391
When do you stop being
able to think creatively?

19:21.394 --> 19:23.327
When do you
get your hands tied?

19:23.329 --> 19:24.762
We don't want that
to happen to us.

19:24.764 --> 19:26.430
You went to a great school.

19:26.432 --> 19:27.532
I'm sure all of you did.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.033
Maya:
You're very smart.

19:29.035 --> 19:31.636
You know this is
the wrong way to think.

19:34.974 --> 19:37.642
You didn't ask me
who my favorite artist is.

19:39.078 --> 19:40.845
It's picasso.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.847
Do you have a favorite artist?

19:44.551 --> 19:46.417
All of them.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.619
Everyone who ever tried...

19:49.756 --> 19:52.173
Including you.

19:52.174 --> 19:54.591
You know, picasso painted
a masterpiece called <i> guernica.</i>

19:54.594 --> 19:57.895
Adults going to war
on horses with swords.

19:57.897 --> 20:01.132
Except for one horse
who was horrified

20:01.134 --> 20:02.733
At what the adults were doing.

20:02.735 --> 20:06.370
He's horrified
because he knows it's wrong.

20:06.372 --> 20:09.140
I've always loved that horse.

20:09.142 --> 20:11.142
And when i was
as young as you,

20:11.143 --> 20:13.143
I made a promise to myself
that if i ever go to war,

20:13.146 --> 20:17.848
I would never forget <i> guernica</i>
and the horse that knew better.

20:19.085 --> 20:21.986
Thank you, ms. Hart,
for reminding me.

20:21.988 --> 20:24.589
No. Thank you.

20:24.591 --> 20:26.557
I love learning about art.

20:26.559 --> 20:27.992
Would have never
known about <i> guernica</i>

20:27.994 --> 20:29.627
If someone didn't care
enough to teach me.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.815
Superintendent turner...

20:33.816 --> 20:36.067
You have been
requesting all along
that we remain patient.

20:36.069 --> 20:38.286
Well, we're all teachers here.

20:38.287 --> 20:40.504
I think we can appreciate
the value of a good lesson.

20:40.506 --> 20:41.739
Turner!

20:41.741 --> 20:43.441
My man!

20:43.443 --> 20:45.509
Would you tell him to stop?

20:46.546 --> 20:48.546
I can't promise
an immediate solution,

20:48.548 --> 20:51.782
But i can promise that we can
try and think differently.

20:51.784 --> 20:54.585
To think creatively
as these students.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.087
Thank you all for coming.

20:56.089 --> 20:57.455
This meeting is adjourned.

20:58.992 --> 21:01.559
But our next meeting
begins right now,

21:01.561 --> 21:03.561
And we will stay here until
we come up with something that

21:03.563 --> 21:06.197
Unties our hands and we begin
to think differently.

21:06.199 --> 21:07.465
Ms. Hart?

21:07.467 --> 21:08.799
Yes, ma'am?

21:08.801 --> 21:10.601
Please hang up my painting.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.703
Yes, ma'am.

21:37.864 --> 21:39.797
Very hopeful, maya.

21:39.799 --> 21:40.898
What do you call it?

21:40.900 --> 21:42.767
<i>The renaissance.</i>

21:46.172 --> 21:47.972
Oh, my eyes!

21:49.642 --> 21:51.542
Want to know what i call it?

21:51.544 --> 21:52.677
I don't care.

21:52.679 --> 21:55.813
<i>50 million purple cats.</i>

21:55.815 --> 21:58.082
Isn't it hopeful?

21:58.084 --> 21:59.483
It is.

21:59.485 --> 22:01.118
Keep painting, riley.

22:02.622 --> 22:04.622
Because it makes you happy.

22:04.624 --> 22:07.992
It makes you feel something,
which is what art is all about.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.063
I'm happy.

22:12.065 --> 22:13.564
I'm a happy artist.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.701
This is why i stink.

22:18.705 --> 22:20.771
All right. Remember
your homework for the weekend

22:20.773 --> 22:23.741
Is to visit any art museum
in the city.

22:23.743 --> 22:28.713
Find something that inspires you
and never forget it

22:28.715 --> 22:32.149
For the rest of your rich
and creative lives.
