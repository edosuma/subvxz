02:50.160 --> 02:51.830
Not again!

02:51.830 --> 02:57.270
Stop taking pictures of your
pretty mom like a paparazzi.

02:57.270 --> 02:59.610
Blame it on your beauty, mom.

02:59.610 --> 03:01.070
I know, but...

03:02.880 --> 03:04.170
I'm starving.

03:04.650 --> 03:07.880
- Say, "please."
- Please, Mom. $10?

03:08.550 --> 03:11.040
Am I your bank, kiddo?

03:12.550 --> 03:14.320
I'll be late today.

03:14.520 --> 03:16.460
Buy yourself dinner with this.

03:16.460 --> 03:17.950
Again?

03:19.330 --> 03:21.950
To prepare for the housing exams.

03:23.300 --> 03:24.530
I'm sleepy already.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.760
Are you jealous?

03:29.100 --> 03:30.930
You like him that much?

03:31.570 --> 03:33.600
You said he was so-so.

03:34.110 --> 03:37.080
Is love a guy's dick
turning big or small?

03:37.310 --> 03:39.210
Jeez, Mom...!

03:39.450 --> 03:41.610
Hey, Juju! Let's go.

03:41.780 --> 03:43.010
Hey, Gigi!

03:43.220 --> 03:47.190
Didn't I tell you to stop calling
my precious son 'Juju'?

03:47.190 --> 03:48.350
Ditto that.

03:48.460 --> 03:50.860
But you keep calling me Gigi.

03:50.860 --> 03:53.120
"Gigi" and Guitar, big difference!

03:54.090 --> 03:56.060
I can call him whatever I like.

03:56.060 --> 03:58.170
What? Stay right there.

03:58.170 --> 03:59.860
I'm going after you!

04:00.330 --> 04:01.490
See you later, Mom!

04:03.670 --> 04:06.070
I'll let you go today, cutie.

04:06.310 --> 04:07.640
Thank you, ma'am.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.600
See you later, Mom!

04:09.810 --> 04:12.050
Eat properly!
Don't eat ramen noodles!

04:12.050 --> 04:13.600
Wait for me!

04:22.190 --> 04:23.590
I'll go nuts.

04:23.920 --> 04:27.290
- Mama says report.
- Wow, scary.

04:30.430 --> 04:31.860
Damn.

04:33.070 --> 04:36.190
How will I survive
the next semester?

04:38.070 --> 04:42.410
- Won't there be a war?
- One's in my stomach.

04:43.110 --> 04:44.770
How about ramen noodles?

04:45.150 --> 04:48.840
Fish balls, 70, topokki, 280,
dumplings, 400.

04:49.050 --> 04:53.990
And ramen is 800 kcal,
you kind bastard.

04:54.590 --> 04:57.220
And why'd I eat ramen with you?

04:58.290 --> 05:00.490
How about a tteok ramen then?

05:40.540 --> 05:44.170
The break is almost over.

05:50.910 --> 05:52.440
Will you...

05:53.480 --> 05:55.820
come to school?

05:59.690 --> 06:01.820
Your phone number's...

06:02.860 --> 06:04.160
changed.

06:19.710 --> 06:21.300
Tteok ramen, please.

06:21.580 --> 06:24.100
No, dumpling ramen.

06:38.600 --> 06:42.620
- Stop hogging chocolates, Porky.
- Stop that, Juju!

06:43.630 --> 06:50.160
The meaning in this sentence is...

06:50.510 --> 06:54.710
I talk, you sleep.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.650
You're in class, huh?

06:58.780 --> 07:01.120
At least have your books open.

07:01.520 --> 07:04.290
Saved by the bell.

07:06.690 --> 07:09.750
Don't get all excited
cuz it's new semester.

07:10.100 --> 07:13.070
One-on-one about your scores
start next week.

07:13.730 --> 07:15.430
Be prepared.

07:23.680 --> 07:26.880
Why is the student director
so into that?

07:32.450 --> 07:34.750
Will this really help sexually?

07:35.190 --> 07:38.520
- Heard he takes eel extracts, too.
- Really?

07:39.490 --> 07:42.160
It only gives me cramps.

07:43.570 --> 07:47.000
Guys would think
you don't have lunch money.

07:47.340 --> 07:50.330
Get lost. I'm on a diet.

07:50.840 --> 07:53.030
Like hell you'll lose weight.

07:54.810 --> 07:56.440
Reading that again?

07:57.780 --> 08:02.580
Boring bastards like you
wouldn't know the world of otaku.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.350
The final episode is out next week.

08:04.990 --> 08:08.720
I need to read it over again
10 times until then.

08:09.290 --> 08:10.760
That fun?

08:12.090 --> 08:13.530
Like hell.

08:14.260 --> 08:16.870
Gaia, the main character,
completely lost control.

08:16.870 --> 08:18.960
She's about to wipe them out.

08:20.070 --> 08:22.060
Cheap bastard!

08:28.010 --> 08:31.910
Wanna go to the silkworm Isle

08:32.820 --> 08:34.409
Even if it's just us?

09:06.720 --> 09:11.380
No one within 300m as usual.

09:12.660 --> 09:14.020
See?

09:15.030 --> 09:20.560
Just us two from my school
and yours.

09:25.970 --> 09:29.910
Who would dare to turn on
the gay app at school?

09:30.280 --> 09:34.080
We met through this remember?

09:35.920 --> 09:38.750
I've kept it on for 6 months...

09:39.890 --> 09:41.750
and there's just us.

09:44.120 --> 09:46.590
There might be more.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.500
Who else is there?

09:53.830 --> 09:55.730
It's just us.

10:03.410 --> 10:05.000
Know what?

10:07.520 --> 10:12.350
They say when you lie,
your nose gets warm.

10:17.530 --> 10:20.020
You have a crush
on someone, right?

10:23.600 --> 10:25.170
Get lost.

10:25.170 --> 10:26.830
Go and study.

10:51.440 --> 10:53.310
Move, you asshole.

10:53.640 --> 10:55.310
Here! Quick, fuck!

11:03.850 --> 11:05.220
- Hey! Hey!
- Buzz off!

11:07.830 --> 11:09.490
You fucking bastard!

11:09.860 --> 11:12.020
Stop right there!

11:12.230 --> 11:12.850
Hey!

11:16.870 --> 11:17.530
Stop!

11:18.340 --> 11:19.740
Get him!

11:20.840 --> 11:22.810
Hurry up!

11:25.700 --> 11:27.460
Han Gi-woong!

11:30.800 --> 11:32.960
Where the hell did he go?

11:33.210 --> 11:34.670
Come out, you shit!

11:38.480 --> 11:39.670
Hey!

11:40.650 --> 11:42.440
Han Gi-woong!

11:43.350 --> 11:44.710
Hey!

12:02.370 --> 12:06.210
Where are you hiding like a rat?

12:06.710 --> 12:08.700
Come on out!

12:09.310 --> 12:10.840
Come out!

12:20.830 --> 12:22.020
Give it back.

12:23.360 --> 12:24.690
I'll shout.

12:40.020 --> 12:43.010
Damn you freaking shit.

12:57.340 --> 12:59.140
Damn thief.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.240
Does it hurt?

13:05.580 --> 13:07.240
Hurts, huh?

13:09.990 --> 13:12.010
You took it.

13:13.590 --> 13:17.490
but I'm taking it back.

13:40.150 --> 13:41.480
Gi-woong!

13:43.650 --> 13:45.250
Han Gi-woong!

13:58.670 --> 14:00.190
Gi-woong!

14:02.440 --> 14:03.740
Han Gi-woong!

14:12.720 --> 14:14.080
Han Gi-woong!

15:21.860 --> 15:23.380
Where is it?

15:24.830 --> 15:26.460
Where is it, I say!

15:30.230 --> 15:34.230
Give me my bike or I'll report
this hires minors.

15:36.940 --> 15:39.740
What did you just say, asshole?

15:42.010 --> 15:43.450
You little!

15:44.210 --> 15:45.740
I'll get going.

15:46.450 --> 15:48.210
Hey, you shithead!

15:48.690 --> 15:51.350
Who's that small fry?

16:12.440 --> 16:13.880
You prick!

16:14.350 --> 16:16.870
Told you not to smoke
in front of the shop.

16:19.120 --> 16:21.080
He's not at the
cheap dorms, either?

16:22.690 --> 16:25.150
Ow, that stings.
Freaking mosquitos.

16:26.060 --> 16:27.520
See you later, boss.

16:28.660 --> 16:30.660
Take your flip-flop,
you idiots.

16:30.660 --> 16:31.690
Yes, sir!

16:34.970 --> 16:39.630
Why are you looking for him?
Said he was released 3 months ago.

16:40.370 --> 16:41.530
Just...

16:41.970 --> 16:44.500
Just, my ass.

16:45.280 --> 16:47.270
It's all out of your wage.

16:48.110 --> 16:49.810
Who the hell is he?

16:55.520 --> 16:59.050
You nailed lip bastard.

16:59.890 --> 17:01.450
Just wait a few more days.

17:29.590 --> 17:32.580
Fuck, get the phone!

17:41.930 --> 17:44.930
I made breakfast,
so eat before you go.

17:55.980 --> 17:58.540
You should attend school.

18:11.130 --> 18:13.260
We're moving next month.

18:53.240 --> 18:55.810
These idiots tried to lynch
Gi-woong on Saturday.

18:55.810 --> 19:00.400
Heard one of them went to E
scalded by ramen.

19:00.950 --> 19:03.050
If I had my hands
on those shitheads.

19:03.050 --> 19:06.680
Stupid assholes,
bandaged like a freaking mummy.

19:07.020 --> 19:09.180
Hey, punching machine!

19:18.200 --> 19:20.030
Guten Morgen!

19:22.030 --> 19:23.360
Good morning!

19:24.670 --> 19:26.690
Good morning, you shit.

19:28.140 --> 19:29.610
Good morning.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.310
Wanna smoke?

19:36.650 --> 19:38.910
You paid for it.

19:41.120 --> 19:45.850
Then again, you shouldn't.
We don't want you broken.

19:47.930 --> 19:53.300
You know Yong-ju here
was looking around for you.

19:54.900 --> 19:57.460
Yeah, I sold off his bike.

19:57.770 --> 20:01.640
What? He had an expensive one.

20:01.640 --> 20:04.340
How much did you get?

20:04.340 --> 20:08.280
Wash it clean, you bastard!

20:16.790 --> 20:18.490
Wasn't Gi-woong...

20:20.030 --> 20:22.590
just a dickhead in junior high?

20:23.260 --> 20:24.750
His dad...

20:25.570 --> 20:27.730
You know what they mean by

20:29.540 --> 20:31.500
a punching machine?

20:34.370 --> 20:36.930
How the fuck would I know?

20:39.550 --> 20:40.840
Hey, Yong-ju!

20:41.180 --> 20:43.170
Answer your goddamn phone!

20:43.720 --> 20:45.950
One-on-one! It's your turn.

21:16.600 --> 21:21.600
You're in grade tier 1, but your
recent scores are a bit risky.

21:21.670 --> 21:24.540
You know we're creating an
honors class next week, right?

21:25.710 --> 21:29.370
To focus on English and Math,
so let's raise your scores a bit.

21:29.580 --> 21:30.550
Sir.

21:32.520 --> 21:36.390
Why? You have something
to say?

21:39.360 --> 21:41.420
Haven't had lunch?

21:42.960 --> 21:44.590
A friend is...

21:48.500 --> 21:50.230
being bullied.

22:00.110 --> 22:02.880
There's no time for friends now.

22:04.150 --> 22:05.710
Just study.

22:09.590 --> 22:11.020
Get back.

22:39.950 --> 22:42.420
Why are you taking pictures?

22:48.000 --> 22:52.260
Did I mention that this
used to be a gay bar?

22:53.300 --> 22:56.290
It got reported coz it's
near a school.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.000
Why did they build it in
such a high place?

23:03.640 --> 23:04.910
Have you...

23:06.810 --> 23:09.280
met a straight before?

23:09.850 --> 23:10.840
Why?

23:13.220 --> 23:14.710
Just curious...

23:15.190 --> 23:17.990
How would the bitches know
if they are straight?

23:22.730 --> 23:24.890
Coz they have girlfriends.

23:25.200 --> 23:28.100
How would they know until
they've slept with me?

23:30.970 --> 23:34.840
Do they know how I taste?
A taste of me?

24:02.470 --> 24:05.030
So, there really is someone...

24:10.610 --> 24:12.100
Did you confess?

24:16.080 --> 24:23.460
Don't ever confess if he'd puke.

24:25.060 --> 24:27.760
Having crushes on a straight is...

24:28.600 --> 24:31.360
like taking rat poison.

24:31.630 --> 24:33.100
Get it?

25:20.180 --> 25:22.310
You know how much it was?

25:23.690 --> 25:27.390
It was $225 with VAT.

25:29.590 --> 25:32.200
Shit, you know your IQ drops
when you get hit?

25:32.200 --> 25:34.100
Goes down by 1.6!

25:34.400 --> 25:36.960
And adolescence is an important time.

25:37.540 --> 25:40.600
It's just you now.
I'm not scared.

25:40.840 --> 25:45.740
Give it!
Hey! Give it!

25:47.780 --> 25:50.210
Give me my bike back.

25:50.480 --> 25:55.650
Or I'll report you're working against
the Juvenile Protection law.

25:58.020 --> 26:00.120
I know your phone number now.

26:02.460 --> 26:03.720
Give it back!

26:04.060 --> 26:08.660
I will not go
until you return it.

26:09.600 --> 26:10.790
Hey!

27:16.210 --> 27:18.200
And give me 50 cents.

27:20.840 --> 27:23.440
You haven't paid back.

27:25.120 --> 27:26.780
Did you...

27:29.590 --> 27:31.520
really sell it?

27:33.190 --> 27:35.120
Did you sell it off?

28:21.140 --> 28:25.910
The place looks expensive.
Did you really sell it here?

28:35.850 --> 28:37.180
Isn't this it?

28:37.790 --> 28:38.850
No.

28:39.090 --> 28:40.560
Fuck, choose whatever!

28:41.330 --> 28:42.380
Who's there?

28:44.330 --> 28:46.130
Stop there!
Who is it?

28:46.330 --> 28:48.230
Wait for me!

29:08.420 --> 29:10.580
You look old now.

29:14.120 --> 29:17.120
You didn't smoke in junior high.

29:25.370 --> 29:27.770
Still make gliders?

29:31.210 --> 29:33.200
Was it summer?

29:33.740 --> 29:39.150
You borrowed 50 cents from me
to buy glue for its wings.

29:39.980 --> 29:44.280
Said you'd pay back
after the mid-terms.

29:46.360 --> 29:49.790
You have a cut on your arm...

29:51.060 --> 29:53.590
From the bike shop, I guess.

29:56.870 --> 29:58.330
What?

30:02.140 --> 30:03.700
Wait up!

30:04.410 --> 30:05.970
What about my bike?

30:06.240 --> 30:08.110
Be responsible.

30:08.850 --> 30:11.040
We didn't get to steal one.

30:14.650 --> 30:16.620
Why do you keep following me?

30:17.020 --> 30:21.010
You stole my bike.

30:21.630 --> 30:26.220
No... why do you keep
sneaking at me?

30:29.430 --> 30:35.130
Since junior high, why do you keep
sneaking at me?

31:40.470 --> 31:44.970
Don't tell... anyone.

32:15.770 --> 32:18.300
Get up when I ask you nicely.

32:18.840 --> 32:22.340
Can I take a day off?
I'm sick.

32:22.910 --> 32:24.510
No, you're not.

32:24.780 --> 32:27.480
You were like this yesterday!

32:28.020 --> 32:29.250
Get up.

32:30.820 --> 32:32.290
Get up!

32:47.840 --> 32:50.140
Are you becoming defiant
coz of me?

32:50.570 --> 32:52.670
What now?

32:53.540 --> 32:56.840
Are you jealous of the man
I'm seeing?

33:00.380 --> 33:02.780
It's not even the first time.

33:04.120 --> 33:07.750
Did you know that IQ drops
when you get hit?

33:09.230 --> 33:12.960
- And where is your bike?
- Lent it to Gi-taek.

33:13.230 --> 33:16.500
You lend it out for 2 weeks,
while you walk?

33:16.500 --> 33:18.430
Told your it broke.

33:27.010 --> 33:28.600
My God!

33:29.750 --> 33:33.210
Is this like a voodoo thing?

33:33.750 --> 33:35.980
It must hurt.

33:40.520 --> 33:44.520
Is this from school violence
on  these days?

33:44.700 --> 33:46.290
It's not!

33:47.130 --> 33:50.970
Then why are you like this?
Hardly talking...

33:50.970 --> 33:53.840
Just leave me alone!

33:55.140 --> 33:57.610
Acting like a refugee in winter!

34:01.950 --> 34:04.210
Your kid is your worst enemy.

34:04.480 --> 34:06.010
Hey, refugee!

34:07.250 --> 34:11.210
He bought it for you.
It's brand-new.

34:23.600 --> 34:24.590
Hey, kiddo!

34:24.870 --> 34:27.800
Aren't you gonna wish me luck
for my exam today?

34:28.409 --> 34:31.139
You kind bastard!

34:33.380 --> 34:35.350
Come grab some cake later.

34:47.760 --> 34:53.389
Social mobility means individuals
or groups in social position...

35:03.440 --> 35:05.310
Minus 2 points, you shit.

35:05.880 --> 35:08.470
In lightspeed, huh?

35:09.710 --> 35:12.270
To minus infinity and beyond?

35:16.590 --> 35:17.750
Look at this bastard...!

35:23.630 --> 35:25.700
Get out! Get out!

35:25.700 --> 35:28.260
Get out of my class!

35:31.800 --> 35:34.270
Get your ass in the teachers' room
after class!

35:35.570 --> 35:38.270
Just because of the fuss on
student Rights Ordinance...

35:39.240 --> 35:41.370
you all think I won't hit you?

35:45.550 --> 35:47.850
What are human
rights to students?

35:48.390 --> 35:50.510
Isn't studying what matters?

35:52.020 --> 35:53.890
I'll say this again.

35:54.190 --> 35:57.560
Students in grade tiers 1-3
will end up ordering chicken.

35:58.330 --> 35:59.870
Repeat after me! Order...!

35:59.870 --> 36:01.300
Order!

36:01.600 --> 36:02.900
Those in tiers 4-6...

36:02.900 --> 36:04.770
...will fry the chicken!

36:05.000 --> 36:06.300
Those in tiers 7-9...

36:06.300 --> 36:08.600
...will deliver the chicken!

36:11.880 --> 36:13.970
Your scores went up, didn't it?

36:14.410 --> 36:19.540
Shit, mine went
down by 5 points.

36:25.890 --> 36:32.300
Don't hang around with that
fat bitch friend of yours.

36:34.630 --> 36:37.230
You show your weakness at school
and you're dead.

36:42.310 --> 36:44.780
He's not on our level.

36:52.920 --> 36:56.650
And don't mess with Gi-woong, either!
You'll get hurt.

36:57.660 --> 36:59.950
You won't find that bike.

37:04.160 --> 37:05.720
What if I do?

37:10.500 --> 37:13.370
I'll piggyback you every day,
fucking bastard.

37:14.170 --> 37:17.470
Guess you don't know shit
about Gi-woong...

37:19.710 --> 37:21.870
Man, you OK?

37:22.150 --> 37:26.950
Fuck, the student director
going berserk in the morning.

37:28.390 --> 37:30.180
The son of a bitch!

37:30.690 --> 37:33.420
Must be true he can't
get his dick up.

37:33.690 --> 37:36.800
He was doing this shit again.

37:36.800 --> 37:38.960
Always sucking on eel extracts.

37:38.960 --> 37:41.690
I saw him piss in the bathroom.

37:42.130 --> 37:44.270
His dick is this small.

37:44.270 --> 37:46.790
Thought it was a mosquito dick.

37:47.070 --> 37:48.370
Come here.

37:48.370 --> 37:50.810
Run over,
you freaking bastard.

37:53.310 --> 37:57.180
You asshole, I told you not to wear
high heeled shoes.

38:02.420 --> 38:04.120
Hey, want a cig?

38:05.620 --> 38:06.590
No.

38:06.590 --> 38:11.220
Fuck your god damn
punching machine, try one.

38:11.700 --> 38:13.960
Just get lost, dickhead.

38:16.070 --> 38:17.900
Who's a dickhead?

38:17.900 --> 38:19.390
Crazy bastard!

38:21.880 --> 38:23.710
Just fuck off.

38:25.450 --> 38:27.850
Who cried in the schoolyard?

38:27.850 --> 38:29.110
Shut up!

38:31.690 --> 38:33.590
Get out, you assholes!

38:37.090 --> 38:37.990
Gi-taek!

38:41.860 --> 38:42.850
- Gi-taek!
- Get out!

38:43.100 --> 38:44.390
Get that camera!

38:46.500 --> 38:47.190
Gi-taek!

38:50.700 --> 38:52.000
Gi-taek!

39:07.930 --> 39:09.420
Shut the door.

39:11.260 --> 39:13.200
Shut the door, I say!

39:35.860 --> 39:38.230
See Seong-jin's mom
herding others like a pig?

39:38.230 --> 39:40.260
They call her, "Pig Mom."

39:41.440 --> 39:46.140
Teachers and parents obey her coz
she has connections to elite universities.

39:46.840 --> 39:52.710
Gi-taek is the victim since
everyone will just cover this up.

39:53.620 --> 39:55.810
Even his own mom.

39:56.650 --> 40:00.310
Seong-jin will probably just get
community service again.

40:13.250 --> 40:17.280
Damn bastard! How many points?

40:19.760 --> 40:20.860
75 points.

40:20.860 --> 40:26.450
What? You can't feel
the impact coz of the fat?

40:26.960 --> 40:29.590
Shit. I'll tell Grandma on you...!

40:35.940 --> 40:37.340
What's my score?

40:40.740 --> 40:42.010
85 points.

40:43.110 --> 40:44.910
Fuck.

40:47.680 --> 40:51.520
Only 85 points? It won't get
Seong-jin in Seoul University.

40:51.820 --> 40:55.190
You bastard, I need 95 to be
in grade tier 1.

40:55.430 --> 40:58.100
Let's send Seong-jin
to college, you bastard.

40:58.230 --> 41:01.290
These jerks don't remember
unless it hurts.

41:05.880 --> 41:06.940
How many points?

41:07.110 --> 41:08.840
What is he doing here?

41:09.520 --> 41:12.680
- Hey, you!
- Who told you to come here?

41:13.090 --> 41:15.050
What are you doing here?

41:16.690 --> 41:19.260
Freaking bastard, you wanna die?

41:19.260 --> 41:20.030
Let go!

41:20.030 --> 41:22.160
You think you're something, huh?

41:22.160 --> 41:23.300
Leave him alone.

41:23.300 --> 41:25.890
Told you not to
hang around here!

41:26.330 --> 41:28.930
You want to be the
punching machine too?

41:29.600 --> 41:31.470
Shut up and get lost, all of you!

41:35.240 --> 41:36.640
Can't hear me?

41:37.950 --> 41:40.000
Fuck, get out, everyone!

41:42.950 --> 41:43.940
Let's go.

42:06.810 --> 42:07.930
Hit me!

42:09.040 --> 42:11.950
Hit me with this.
I'll give you 100 points.

42:12.480 --> 42:15.450
Hit me with the real thing!

42:17.350 --> 42:19.180
We're... friends, aren't we?

42:21.684 --> 42:24.316
- Remember we used to...
- Shut up!

42:49.810 --> 42:52.040
The kid who died last year...

42:53.550 --> 42:59.110
Before jumping off the roof,
he was in the elevator like this.

43:01.260 --> 43:03.920
I told mom about him.

43:04.530 --> 43:06.790
And you know what she said?

43:09.400 --> 43:12.030
"Did he get good grades?"

43:16.140 --> 43:18.400
The final episode of Gaia.

43:18.840 --> 43:21.500
It wasn't a happy ending.

43:23.050 --> 43:26.180
The main character dies like a fool.

43:29.020 --> 43:35.790
If the world is this shitty,
shouldn't the ending be happy?

43:37.490 --> 43:40.550
What have we done so wrong...

43:43.100 --> 43:46.300
that we can't even laugh at the end?

43:48.040 --> 43:51.600
It means at least we should laugh
because the world is shitty.

43:51.940 --> 43:54.670
Bad guys don't laugh.

43:55.380 --> 43:57.680
So we should.

43:58.080 --> 43:59.740
Shouldn't we, fatso?

44:00.120 --> 44:01.810
Stop crying.

44:03.690 --> 44:05.350
Stop.

44:07.160 --> 44:08.990
It's alright.

44:15.630 --> 44:16.830
Hush!

45:06.520 --> 45:07.950
Did you call the boys?

45:08.860 --> 45:13.090
It's another kid from Ilsin High.

45:16.460 --> 45:20.330
The kid we've been asked to
protect is Gyeong-sik.

45:20.670 --> 45:22.860
His parents are
really concerned.

45:23.340 --> 45:26.870
The police must be lousy
since we get all these jobs.

45:28.810 --> 45:32.910
Keep it as your wage, kid.

45:36.450 --> 45:38.010
Right?

45:38.620 --> 45:41.320
You'll find him soon,
since the boys are out searching.

45:43.020 --> 45:45.860
Your life is pretty shitty, too.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.030
See you, sir.

45:48.030 --> 45:49.960
Talk to him nicely.

46:24.390 --> 46:25.720
Smile.

46:26.690 --> 46:28.660
Smile, you shit!

46:30.330 --> 46:33.350
You need to keep that smile
on your ugly faces.

46:37.570 --> 46:40.800
If you so much
as touch Gyeong-sik...

46:41.240 --> 46:42.870
I'll kill you...

46:45.110 --> 46:49.380
If you go near him,
I'll kill you.

46:51.620 --> 46:54.180
If you report to the police.

46:54.920 --> 46:57.480
I'll stab your mother.

47:17.610 --> 47:19.510
Sophomore at Ilsin High.

47:19.940 --> 47:21.500
Kim Jin-seok.

47:22.410 --> 47:24.710
Don't pick on your friends...

47:26.020 --> 47:28.420
- Aren't you going to answer me?
- Yes.

47:29.220 --> 47:31.380
Let's never meet again...

47:31.890 --> 47:32.950
Beat it!

47:33.220 --> 47:36.190
Live right, you bastards.

47:37.590 --> 47:39.120
See you tomorrow.

47:40.560 --> 47:42.120
See ya.

48:01.920 --> 48:03.420
You'll definitely pass.

48:03.420 --> 48:08.230
I think I made it.
but just barely.

48:08.230 --> 48:09.690
Congratulations.

48:43.070 --> 48:44.860
Delivery.

48:48.740 --> 48:50.370
Delivery!

48:58.350 --> 49:01.480
The money is inside.

49:03.120 --> 49:04.980
Or you can go if you want.

49:14.600 --> 49:16.360
Do you know
how late you are?

49:17.770 --> 49:20.360
I should make a complaint.

49:28.380 --> 49:31.040
My wallet is inside.

49:40.220 --> 49:45.460
What a shitty service.
Is that how you're trained?

49:49.830 --> 49:50.820
Eat.

49:52.400 --> 49:54.300
I'll pay you then.

50:13.260 --> 50:15.850
Eat up the crusts too.

51:24.900 --> 51:26.990
I got your name...

51:28.170 --> 51:30.140
Back then.

52:40.080 --> 52:41.910
I'm Shin Yong-ju.

52:52.690 --> 52:54.060
Han Gi-woong.

53:37.640 --> 53:41.630
Don't know about the others,
but you don't scare me.

53:48.450 --> 53:50.220
I still have this.

53:55.630 --> 53:57.190
Don't worry.

53:58.200 --> 53:59.690
Have them on digital files...

54:03.400 --> 54:05.200
You like me?

54:06.510 --> 54:08.770
Crazy bastard.

54:15.290 --> 54:17.780
Don't you come near me.

54:18.460 --> 54:19.890
I'll kill you.

54:57.660 --> 54:59.490
Han Gi-woong.

55:07.240 --> 55:09.330
Take this.

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.480
Just like old days.

01:00:59.590 --> 01:01:01.560
Just like then.

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:08.900
Know what?

01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:14.800
When Mongolians
like someone, they say...

01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:18.800
"Let's go to the
mountain together."

01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:29.150
And Eskimos say,
"Let's laugh together."

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:33.690
It's corny.

01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:39.690
But, isn't it nice and short?

01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:51.680
But then, you don't even know
how to smile.

01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:18.440
Thanks...

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:22.440
for coming with me.

01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:29.510
That girl...

01:02:35.590 --> 01:02:37.720
is she your girlfriend?

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:27.310
Gi-woong!

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:30.650
Han Gi-woong!

01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:51.310
Okay, I'll call you back.
I will!

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:54.710
Why are you so late?

01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:08.000
Why didn't you turn on
the light?

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.900
- Don't turn it on.
- Why not?

01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:14.290
Just leave it and get out!

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:16.930
Why are you yelling?

01:05:17.610 --> 01:05:20.940
Your words
are thorny these days.

01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:24.510
What is the matter with you?

01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:26.740
Talk, for goodness' sake.

01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:31.910
My situation is enough of
a thriller as it is.

01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:37.250
Do you tell me everything?
You live the way you want.

01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:41.820
What did I say?

01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:46.500
You can live your life
the way you want it.

01:06:16.830 --> 01:06:19.320
You must be going through
puberty again.

01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:21.640
That's shitty.

01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:24.740
Better than menopause.

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:29.000
What would you know...

01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:33.440
You think flowers
only bloom in spring?

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:37.010
They bloom in autumn, too.

01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:55.190
Han Gi-woong.

01:06:55.710 --> 01:06:57.760
Absent again?

01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:01.770
It's the fourth day already.

01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:03.510
Class president.

01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:04.570
Yes, sir.

01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:08.160
Contact him. One more absence
and he's expelled.

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:12.110
Absence counts as 2 points.
Don't miss school.

01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:16.860
You all know about the honors class
that starts today, huh?

01:07:17.970 --> 01:07:20.900
Those of you in the honors,
go to classroom 2.

01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:25.410
It's based on your grades.
You think it's unfair?

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:28.640
Then study.

01:07:29.810 --> 01:07:31.510
OK, get moving.

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:41.610
It's like an exodus.

01:07:42.730 --> 01:07:45.220
Is this a wrecked ship?

01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:10.580
- Aren't you going?
- I'm coming.

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:07.790
What's with that jerk now?

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:14.441
What's the matter?

01:10:14.530 --> 01:10:16.090
Jeez!

01:10:17.260 --> 01:10:19.530
You really wanna do it?

01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:31.110
Told you not to take
rat poison.

01:10:33.850 --> 01:10:36.150
Think I don't have any pride?

01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:43.590
So, did the bastard...

01:10:44.190 --> 01:10:46.520
puke when you confessed?

01:10:55.970 --> 01:10:58.060
Don't do it
if you're not confident.

01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:00.170
Watch out for rumors.

01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:06.670
Am I some toy to you?

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:09.050
I'm transferring...

01:11:21.130 --> 01:11:24.100
Mom says she'll die of shame.

01:11:26.130 --> 01:11:28.300
Wants me to transfer far away.

01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:34.440
My teacher ratted on me to Mom.

01:11:39.810 --> 01:11:41.180
Damn.

01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:44.680
I can't even take part
in the school festival now.

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:52.980
Then again, it's not the first time.

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:55.520
Huh?

01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:03.570
The power's back.

01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:10.200
So pretty...!

01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:18.410
Been here for 3 months...

01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:21.320
and never seen it so lively.

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:30.090
NIGHT FLIGHT

01:12:30.230 --> 01:12:34.970
Guess it'll be hard to visit here.

01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:39.300
Hard to see you.

01:12:46.650 --> 01:12:48.710
Wanna go... take a shit?

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:02.830
Let's just go.

01:13:06.170 --> 01:13:08.640
What if we get caught?

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:11.170
So what?

01:13:11.770 --> 01:13:13.830
I'm through with this school now.

01:13:20.250 --> 01:13:23.150
This will surprise them.

01:13:25.050 --> 01:13:26.950
Homeroom teacher, the eunuch.

01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:30.450
Have eunuch bastards for
generations to come.

01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:35.860
You think... you're the
only one with a mouth?

01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:38.390
Who's there!

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:40.500
Hey!

01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:43.000
HERE TOO

01:13:43.170 --> 01:13:44.370
- Stop right there!
- Don't follow.

01:13:44.370 --> 01:13:45.580
Stop right there!

01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:58.790
See you over the break.

01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:15.240
Jun-woo.

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:19.750
Song Jun-woo!

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:31.190
Don't you do it.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.490
Don't you turn your back on me.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:56.260
Was seen there yesterday.

01:14:56.770 --> 01:14:58.500
But that's all.

01:15:01.850 --> 01:15:03.210
Good luck.

01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:08.250
My only weak point is,
I'm too soft.

01:15:16.130 --> 01:15:19.150
Where are you off to now?
Wait for me.

01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:22.760
Why? You're gonna run off again?

01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:27.700
Fuck, what's the matter
with you these days?

01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:31.040
Tell that small fry bastard,
that I'll kill him!

01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:34.870
- Come. Let's go.
- Let go, let go.

01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:41.210
Where the hell have you been?

01:15:49.630 --> 01:15:53.220
The school will kick you out
if you don't come and write a pledge.

01:16:03.670 --> 01:16:06.540
You know how much I looked for you?

01:16:09.850 --> 01:16:11.640
You'll come to school, right?

01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:19.050
I get nervous without you.

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:22.620
The bastards act up like shit.

01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:25.530
Can't focus on my studies, either...

01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:28.690
Who would I trust except you?

01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:33.340
Am I your mom?

01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:58.190
REHIRE LAID-OFF WORKERS
IMMEDIATELY

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.270
Where did Han sang-gi go?

01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:07.030
Where is he?

01:17:07.610 --> 01:17:11.770
You must know, you were his friend.

01:17:12.150 --> 01:17:13.770
Let go, damn.

01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:16.470
You would know where he is!

01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:19.410
I said, let go!

01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:28.630
Why do you pretend you don't know.
He was your leader!

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:30.120
Where is he?!

01:17:30.930 --> 01:17:34.540
Not talking?
I know he was here.

01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:36.940
- Stop it!
- Don't pretend you don't know!

01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:39.700
- We don't know, either!
- Bring him now!

01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:44.710
- We can't do anything here!
- I'm not going, fuck!

01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:47.670
Bring him here!

01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:49.780
Bring him now!

01:17:52.090 --> 01:17:53.820
Please calm down!

01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:56.120
Bring back the son of a bitch!

01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:59.250
Bring Han Sang-gi! Now!

01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:28.760
Hey, Han Gi-woong!

01:19:29.670 --> 01:19:32.270
Coming and going as you please.

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:39.910
Go see the student director
right now.

01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:42.250
Now!

01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:58.470
Shin Yong-ju...

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:01.030
Yes, sir?

01:20:04.210 --> 01:20:07.940
Write the pledge if you
don't want to be kicked out.

01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:18.120
Am I a joke to you?
I was in the Marine Corp.

01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:20.950
Start writing!

01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:24.460
Are you getting
fresh with me now?

01:20:26.970 --> 01:20:29.800
Think I haven't seen
bastards like you before?

01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:34.070
Why don't you just drop out?

01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:36.870
Instead of ruining the
academic atmosphere.

01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:52.890
Mr. Yi must be tough
with these idiots.

01:20:57.300 --> 01:21:01.500
Come see me at the
teachers' office later.

01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:07.240
Come here.

01:21:14.890 --> 01:21:16.480
Sit down.

01:21:21.290 --> 01:21:23.760
Don't you have
something to tell me?

01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:29.090
You're wearing glasses, sir.

01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:34.340
You feel like joking at a
time like this?

01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:41.470
This came from the other school.

01:21:42.050 --> 01:21:44.340
The teachers'
office is in an uproar.

01:21:55.330 --> 01:21:56.990
Are you...

01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:59.700
a gay, too?

01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:19.330
Just promise me one thing.

01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:22.060
Get into Seoul University.

01:22:23.770 --> 01:22:26.020
Nothing else matters.

01:22:30.610 --> 01:22:32.130
Go back to class.

01:22:57.770 --> 01:23:02.470
In extreme cases,
sexual assaults or murder.

01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:06.980
They say they followed
what they saw on film or...

01:23:07.220 --> 01:23:09.270
Whose fault is it?

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:12.810
Adolescents follow stars and trends.

01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:22.130
Clothes, bags, shoes that stars wear
on TV become sold out.

01:23:24.030 --> 01:23:29.630
Why are you still on page 69?
Everyone else is on page 70.

01:23:30.770 --> 01:23:32.740
You like 69, don't you?

01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:34.980
He watches porn every day.

01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:36.810
"I'm coming!" "I'm coming!"

01:23:37.450 --> 01:23:39.350
Be quiet!

01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:46.590
Should you be watching porn
and jerking off?

01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:48.350
Just go to college.

01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:52.180
Then no one will care
whatever you do.

01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:54.220
Bastards.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.900
You know what?

01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:04.430
I heard a bastard at our school
is a homo...

01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:07.110
Heard he's in this class.

01:24:07.410 --> 01:24:08.780
Who is it?

01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:13.710
How disgusting...!

01:24:14.450 --> 01:24:18.010
Guess someone will end up
with a male daughter-in-law.

01:24:20.090 --> 01:24:24.490
Cut the shit and just
study hard, got it?

01:24:24.490 --> 01:24:26.020
Yes, sir.

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:29.570
And go to church on weekends
and pray hard, got that?

01:24:29.570 --> 01:24:31.190
Yes, sir.

01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:35.510
Attention, salute the teacher.

01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:36.840
Thank you, sir.

01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:38.330
It's you right.

01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:44.580
- Is it you?
- No way!

01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:47.480
- Is it you?
- No!

01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:55.680
Which bastard is it?
What if he has AIDS?

01:26:46.540 --> 01:26:49.140
Run away with me.

01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:57.440
I'm so scared.

01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:14.640
Know where the southernmost
train station is?

01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:21.810
It's Yeosu.
I thought it was Busan.

01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:25.870
The last train leaves...

01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:31.120
at 8 o'clock.

01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:52.180
They say if it leaves four trails
it's an airliner.

01:27:53.110 --> 01:27:57.480
If it leaves two,
it's a fighter jet.

01:28:00.150 --> 01:28:02.750
Damn, this is shitty.

01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:21.910
Don't you...

01:28:24.810 --> 01:28:26.510
get lonely?

01:28:33.790 --> 01:28:35.720
Han Gi-woong!

01:28:53.170 --> 01:28:56.010
Heard they'll tear down this place
next week.

01:29:00.910 --> 01:29:03.140
Should we leave it on?

01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:18.690
Turning your back to me
even to the end.

01:29:45.730 --> 01:29:47.700
What are you... to me?

01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:50.560
Can't you...

01:29:51.770 --> 01:29:54.290
just smile for me?

01:29:58.710 --> 01:30:00.640
So stupid.

01:30:01.150 --> 01:30:02.640
Yeah.

01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:05.953
So I'll never look at you again...

01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:10.280
never call your name again...

01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:14.890
never remember a bastard
like you...

01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:20.390
not even for a second.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.400
Guess I'll find someone again.

01:30:58.810 --> 01:31:04.610
This world is over
without a friend.

01:31:15.020 --> 01:31:17.550
Although you'll never know.

01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:50.690
My son.

01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:54.830
Who never answers
the goddamn phone.

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:01.870
Is something wrong?

01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:11.350
The hot news is, your mom's been
dumped again.

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:14.850
It's not the first time
either, anyway!

01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:19.850
Drink up, Juju.
It's okay with your Mom.

01:32:25.140 --> 01:32:30.240
Any bastard who says "Love is
two people standing side by side...

01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:35.580
looking in the same direction"
are all freaking crooks.

01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:43.720
Then drivers rushing on the highway
all fall in love?

01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:45.520
What a laugh.

01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:47.880
Love is...

01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:55.130
looking at different directions.

01:32:55.400 --> 01:33:01.600
The bastard couldn't accept
this professional life of mine.

01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:06.670
Is love a guy's dick?
Turning big or small?

01:33:06.910 --> 01:33:08.280
Fuck.

01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:19.760
Mom.

01:33:21.330 --> 01:33:22.530
What?

01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:26.060
Do you know...

01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:29.070
everything about me?

01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:38.980
How would I know, you bastard.

01:33:41.150 --> 01:33:43.280
Did you kill someone?

01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:53.060
I've learned one thing...

01:33:53.400 --> 01:34:00.640
by raising a son as
a single unwed mother at 26.

01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:07.210
There's nothing stupid as
minding what the world thinks of you.

01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:16.760
I got no end of scorn and temptation
for being a single mom, you know?

01:34:17.890 --> 01:34:25.530
I only want you to live
without hurting other people.

01:34:26.030 --> 01:34:28.220
Don't care about studies and all.

01:34:28.410 --> 01:34:30.270
Even if...

01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:35.070
I'm different from other people?

01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:46.450
Shin Yong-ju!

01:34:47.660 --> 01:34:49.890
Who gave birth to you?

01:34:51.430 --> 01:34:53.990
Does that fact change...

01:34:54.300 --> 01:35:00.140
even if you grow
goblin horns on your head?

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.470
When are you packing?

01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:44.400
He's doing well?

01:35:49.110 --> 01:35:50.970
What does it matter?

01:35:57.080 --> 01:36:02.950
He can't come home because of
police surveillance.

01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:09.260
Not embarrassed that labor union
bastards gave him the cold shoulder?

01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:11.460
Criminal bastard.

01:37:15.530 --> 01:37:17.120
You're here early.

01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:31.340
Good morning.

01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:32.570
Hi.

01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:26.720
Hey, homo!

01:38:28.290 --> 01:38:29.950
Where're you going?

01:38:31.090 --> 01:38:33.180
I heard you're the gay king?

01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:35.490
I really like gays, too.

01:38:35.490 --> 01:38:36.080
Get out.

01:38:36.130 --> 01:38:37.130
Get out!

01:38:37.130 --> 01:38:39.560
Get lost. Fucking bastards!

01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:43.700
Get out now,
before I bash your skulls!

01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:51.640
I hear you're a pro
at this, Yong-ju.

01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:56.850
Suck mine, too.

01:38:57.250 --> 01:38:58.620
You homo bastard!

01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:00.510
Fuck.

01:39:01.090 --> 01:39:03.320
It was like a hidden picture puzzle.

01:39:03.660 --> 01:39:06.990
Wondered who it was...
in our class.

01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:09.660
Does your grandma know, too?

01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:12.020
Who says so?

01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:15.390
This friend here...

01:39:16.140 --> 01:39:17.330
No?

01:39:18.540 --> 01:39:20.700
No... jerks.

01:39:21.810 --> 01:39:23.380
Where do you think you're going?

01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:26.870
Suck mine, too.
You fucking bastard!

01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:29.690
Stay still, you dirty asshole.

01:39:29.690 --> 01:39:31.240
You like that?

01:39:34.990 --> 01:39:36.190
Stay still.

01:39:36.830 --> 01:39:38.990
Hey, get the fuck out.

01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:41.900
Told you to stay still.

01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:46.230
Heard Gi-taek
witnessed yesterday.

01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:52.370
I wonder what this is.

01:39:57.210 --> 01:40:00.270
You know what schwul
in German means?

01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:03.620
Schwul.

01:40:04.450 --> 01:40:08.550
Ho, mo, sex, ual.

01:40:09.230 --> 01:40:11.130
I even like the sound of it.

01:40:11.130 --> 01:40:13.360
Homo schwul bastard.

01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:15.250
Let him go.

01:40:16.170 --> 01:40:17.390
Get up.

01:40:24.670 --> 01:40:26.010
Yong-ju.

01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:32.140
Friends wouldn't spread rumors
or anything, right?

01:40:36.850 --> 01:40:38.150
And...

01:40:41.590 --> 01:40:47.690
Lower yourself a bit
when you talk to people.

01:40:49.370 --> 01:40:51.030
Fucking bastard.

01:40:53.700 --> 01:40:55.830
Because this is your eye level.

01:40:58.940 --> 01:41:00.600
Hey, let's go.

01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:07.540
See you tomorrow, homo.

01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:23.170
You're the one
who betrayed first!

01:41:23.170 --> 01:41:24.930
What betrayal?

01:41:26.900 --> 01:41:28.370
Disgusting.

01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:32.000
You and Gi-woong both!

01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:38.040
Gi-taek!

01:41:56.340 --> 01:41:58.470
Hey, Han Gi-woong!

01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:13.510
Why so cold?

01:42:19.530 --> 01:42:22.290
I'm beginning to forget your face.

01:42:28.140 --> 01:42:32.070
Gi-taek is our friend now.
It's about time.

01:42:37.350 --> 01:42:39.710
You and Yong-ju aren't
like that, huh?

01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:46.520
There's been such a rumor.

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:56.430
Our leader shouldn't be
like that, right?

01:43:11.380 --> 01:43:14.010
I have a question.

01:43:15.350 --> 01:43:20.160
This guy set a factory on fire
and went to jail several years ago.

01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:27.160
Someone you know?

01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:29.930
No, right?

01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:36.760
Can't have the school look bad
with low-income classes.

01:43:43.220 --> 01:43:48.590
Don't come near me!
It's your freaking dad!

01:43:49.060 --> 01:43:52.730
You cried after getting beaten
by kids in junior high.

01:43:52.730 --> 01:43:53.990
Didn't you?

01:43:54.290 --> 01:43:58.130
Teachers didn't like you either.
so they spread a rumor at school!

01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:08.640
What did I do so wrong?

01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:12.810
That you all bully me?

01:44:39.370 --> 01:44:44.810
Do you deliver chicken, too?
Bring some here if you have time.

01:44:46.050 --> 01:44:48.540
You're coming to school tomorrow?

01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:59.420
Fuck, hit me!
Hit me, you son of a bitch!

01:44:59.630 --> 01:45:01.190
You betrayed me first!

01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:10.060
I was never... your friend.

01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:19.610
Let go! Fuck...

01:45:46.620 --> 01:45:48.110
Excuse me.

01:46:21.390 --> 01:46:23.520
How did you find me?

01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:27.650
Why did you come out?

01:46:29.860 --> 01:46:32.200
To set this place on fire?

01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:45.440
You know how
Mom and I've been living?

01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:49.680
Why did you do it? Why?

01:46:51.620 --> 01:46:55.720
You know how I've been living
all because of your high horse?

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.960
Damn, why did you do it?

01:47:12.670 --> 01:47:18.670
You've grown a lot.
Should've bought a razor.

01:47:29.220 --> 01:47:31.020
Gi-woong!

01:47:32.130 --> 01:47:33.290
Gi-woong!

01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:36.390
Gi-woong!

01:47:36.500 --> 01:47:37.860
Han Gi-woong!

01:47:40.130 --> 01:47:41.530
Fuck, let go!

01:47:54.020 --> 01:47:55.980
I'm sorry.

01:48:10.130 --> 01:48:12.900
Thought you were dead.

01:48:16.540 --> 01:48:19.100
Don't die on us.

01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:10.000
Nothing but a dickhead.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.970
Out of my way!

01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:35.360
Gi-woong, you okay?

01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:51.040
Gi-woong.

01:49:56.100 --> 01:49:57.600
Han Gi-woong!

01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:12.230
Fuck off.

01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:20.140
Gi-woong!

01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:24.710
Han Gi-woong!

01:53:26.230 --> 01:53:28.330
Aren't you packing?

01:53:33.240 --> 01:53:37.800
We aren't moving anyway.

01:54:07.110 --> 01:54:09.040
I made breakfast.

01:54:10.410 --> 01:54:12.110
Let's eat.

01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:35.770
Hey, stop right there!

01:54:38.700 --> 01:54:41.230
Son of a bitch, stop!

01:54:42.110 --> 01:54:44.940
Hey, stop right there bitch!

01:54:49.050 --> 01:54:50.910
Come here.

01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:59.520
Thanks for the damn
morning exercise.

01:54:59.790 --> 01:55:02.450
Damn bitch,
think you can run away?

01:55:04.530 --> 01:55:07.290
Seong-jin!

01:55:08.670 --> 01:55:12.100
- Come down you asshole.
- Let go!

01:55:42.370 --> 01:55:45.270
Careful with that taser!

01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:51.640
Didn't I tell you not to
challenge me?

01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:54.020
Bring the bastard's camera!

01:55:54.020 --> 01:55:56.280
Relax, you shit.

01:55:57.090 --> 01:55:58.520
Gi-taek!

01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:00.820
Shut up, you bitch.

01:56:02.390 --> 01:56:05.330
Shoot it nice and quick.
I'll put it up on Youtube.

01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:09.530
Like it?

01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:13.400
Like it?!

01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:18.070
Hey, you bitch!

01:56:18.340 --> 01:56:21.240
Like it? Huh?

01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:32.020
Han Gi-woong!

01:56:36.390 --> 01:56:38.090
Yong-ju...

01:57:13.670 --> 01:57:15.100
Yong-ju!

01:57:16.770 --> 01:57:18.330
Shin Yong-ju!

01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:22.500
Shin Yong-ju!

01:58:32.310 --> 01:58:33.940
Yong-ju!

01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:56.430
They even took the memory chip.

01:58:57.270 --> 01:59:00.700
This cost $100 without VAT.

01:59:22.100 --> 01:59:23.760
Don't you...

01:59:25.870 --> 01:59:27.960
Come near me, either.

01:59:33.870 --> 01:59:35.270
Fuck off.

02:00:08.510 --> 02:00:11.410
That bastard always comes
in the middle of class.

02:00:13.020 --> 02:00:14.450
Take your seat now!

02:00:15.050 --> 02:00:16.250
Sit down now!

02:00:16.890 --> 02:00:17.950
Where is it?

02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:21.810
- What is?
- Bastard, late and all...

02:00:24.090 --> 02:00:25.720
Stop it!

02:00:28.130 --> 02:00:29.120
Sit!

02:00:30.230 --> 02:00:32.200
- Sit down!
- Where is it bastard!

02:00:32.540 --> 02:00:33.260
Stop it!

02:00:38.840 --> 02:00:41.370
Let go, son of a bitch!

02:00:41.650 --> 02:00:42.810
Give it back!

02:00:46.620 --> 02:00:48.520
You shit!

02:01:00.630 --> 02:01:03.690
Han Gi-woong!
You fucking bastard!

02:01:10.370 --> 02:01:11.900
Where is it?

02:01:13.340 --> 02:01:15.110
Where the hell is it!

02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:21.520
I have nothing...

02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:49.050
What's this?

02:01:49.050 --> 02:01:52.110
What are you doing in
the honors class? Get out!

02:01:52.720 --> 02:01:53.910
Give it back.

02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:55.250
Give what?

02:01:55.250 --> 02:01:57.950
Fuck, give it!

02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:01.260
Get out you crazy shit!

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:09.930
You bastard!

02:02:12.070 --> 02:02:15.200
Give it back,
you son of a bitch!

02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:19.210
Fuck!

02:02:26.350 --> 02:02:27.870
Son of a bitch!

02:02:30.620 --> 02:02:33.060
Fuck, give it back
dammit!

02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:40.530
Fuck!

02:02:51.010 --> 02:02:52.670
Fucking bastard...

02:02:56.180 --> 02:03:00.140
Think you can still run away?

02:03:23.140 --> 02:03:24.840
Han Gi-woong!

02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:26.300
Bastard!

02:03:27.210 --> 02:03:28.950
What the hell are you doing?

02:03:28.950 --> 02:03:30.610
Fuck!

02:03:59.180 --> 02:04:00.310
Stop it!

02:04:00.310 --> 02:04:01.550
Stop!

02:04:01.550 --> 02:04:02.140
No!

02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:07.140
Gi-woong!

02:04:10.150 --> 02:04:13.420
Call an ambulance,
an ambulance!

02:04:16.360 --> 02:04:18.520
Call an ambulance.

02:04:58.070 --> 02:04:59.830
What are you going to do now?

02:05:00.100 --> 02:05:01.900
Are you transferring?

02:05:04.070 --> 02:05:05.560
Dropping out.

02:05:09.580 --> 02:05:12.110
Why didn't you report earlier?

02:05:14.690 --> 02:05:18.620
How would that help?

02:05:44.980 --> 02:05:48.510
What is he doing?
Is he nuts or something?

02:05:49.190 --> 02:05:53.320
- Must be crazy...
- Isn't he the one...?

02:05:53.520 --> 02:05:55.690
You crazy bastard!
Get down now!

02:05:55.690 --> 02:05:57.130
Hey! You son of a bitch!

02:05:57.290 --> 02:06:00.030
Get down, get down!

02:06:00.030 --> 02:06:03.660
Get down, I say!

02:06:03.900 --> 02:06:06.340
Get down, you bastard!

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.870
What the hell are you doing
to the school building?

02:06:10.240 --> 02:06:11.380
You wacko.

02:06:11.380 --> 02:06:14.170
Erase it all before you go.

02:06:16.550 --> 02:06:19.450
Crazy bastard.

02:06:22.390 --> 02:06:24.350
Go up and erase it.

02:06:25.220 --> 02:06:27.380
Erase it, hurry!

02:06:28.590 --> 02:06:30.590
A GAY LIVES HERE TOO

02:06:30.590 --> 02:06:32.650
Go bring a teacher.

02:07:33.600 --> 02:07:36.060
Even if they settle...

02:07:37.730 --> 02:07:41.000
you would have to do time
for about 5 months.

02:07:53.220 --> 02:07:54.740
I'm sorry.

02:07:57.650 --> 02:07:59.590
For not coming sooner.

02:08:04.260 --> 02:08:06.820
It's in my pants pocket.

02:09:31.490 --> 02:09:35.520
I dropped out today.

02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:42.330
I'm going to an alternative school
in the provinces.

02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:49.110
It's a school in a mountain.

02:09:50.980 --> 02:09:53.350
Gandhi school.

02:09:53.850 --> 02:09:55.440
They have dorms...

02:09:55.630 --> 02:09:57.560
Don't go.

02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:03.320
It's so hard...

02:10:05.270 --> 02:10:08.140
I think I'll break down.

02:10:12.540 --> 02:10:15.670
- Never again...
- Never again.

02:10:21.080 --> 02:10:22.450
Please...

02:10:33.060 --> 02:10:36.230
I'm fucking lonely.
