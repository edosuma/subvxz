<i>Tonight on st. Elsewhere.</i>

00:04.232 --> 00:06.417
I acted like a jerk.
I'm sorry.

00:06.484 --> 00:10.875
- Now you want me to go
to dinner with you?
- To my wife. I'll keep her.

00:10.942 --> 00:13.945
This chemotherapy Stuff's
for the birds.

00:14.011 --> 00:19.150
If I wanna spend a night
like that, I'll head out
drinking with my brother walt.

00:19.217 --> 00:21.953
You are closer to me
than anyone, Arthur.

00:22.019 --> 00:25.990
You wanna go up to bank park,
indulge in a little heavy
petting for the last time?

00:26.057 --> 00:28.826
Dr. Westphall, I want you
to stop the chemotherapy.

00:28.893 --> 00:32.095
I want you to leave him alone.
I want you to let him die!
Mr. Shaefer--

02:07.458 --> 02:13.197
Yeah, but, Jerry, you said you'd
send somebody over to fix
this thing two days Ago.

02:13.264 --> 02:17.101
Look, Jerry, the paperwork
is starting to pile up.

02:17.168 --> 02:21.339
Huh? What do you mean
you've been busy
with a new account?

02:21.406 --> 02:23.741
Auto parts?

02:23.808 --> 02:26.444
Jerry, this is a hospital.

02:26.511 --> 02:28.513
We use this machine
to store Patients' records,

02:28.579 --> 02:33.317
not to keep inventory
of carburetors
and exhaust Pipes.

02:33.384 --> 02:37.522
Yeah, as soon as possible.
[ Chuckles ]

02:37.588 --> 02:40.258
Yeah, somebody will be here.

02:41.292 --> 02:43.227
It's too early for this.

02:43.294 --> 02:45.763
Are we still on for lunch?
Are you still buying?

02:45.830 --> 02:48.199
Oh, it's your birthday.
That's right. That's right.

02:48.266 --> 02:51.636
I'll see you later.

02:51.703 --> 02:54.505
Yeah, Yeah. Nurses' station,
second floor.

02:54.572 --> 02:56.808
Who? Dr. White.
Yeah, he's right here.

02:56.874 --> 02:58.810
Dr. White.
Thank you.

02:58.876 --> 03:01.412
- Yeah, this is White.
- Did I wish you
a happy birthday?

03:01.479 --> 03:03.815
Yep. Very early this morning.

03:03.881 --> 03:07.685
It was worth getting up for,
wasn't it?
Well, what's up?

03:07.752 --> 03:10.121
I'm calling to see
what you're doing for lunch.

03:10.188 --> 03:12.290
Uh, Jack Morrison's
taking me out.
Oh.

03:12.356 --> 03:16.227
Uh, what about tonight?
Uh, I'm all yours.

03:16.294 --> 03:19.063
Can you be home by 8:00?

03:19.130 --> 03:21.332
Uh, yeah.
What'd you have in mind?

03:21.399 --> 03:23.634
The best birthday party
you've ever had.

03:23.701 --> 03:25.703
You and me alone?
Lots of party games.

03:25.770 --> 03:27.705
You want me
to pick up some wine?
Okay.

03:27.772 --> 03:31.142
Oh, and, Peter,
one last thing.
Yeah, what's that?

03:31.209 --> 03:34.345
If I catch you looking at
another woman like that again,

03:34.412 --> 03:36.314
this could be
your last birthday.

03:40.918 --> 03:45.256
- See you tonight.
- Jill, Wait, wait, wait.

03:48.793 --> 03:51.996
Dr. Westphall.
Good morning, Annie.
What's up?

03:52.063 --> 03:54.499
You should know.
Your patient, Arthur shaefer--

03:54.565 --> 03:57.969
Renal cell Carcinoma.
Yeah.
He had a PRETTY rough Night.

03:58.036 --> 04:01.606
Vomiting,
intermittent hallucinations,
a lot of pain.

04:01.672 --> 04:04.575
I ordered an ADDITIONAL
10 milligrams of morphine
early this morning.

04:04.642 --> 04:07.111
Did he respond?
Not as well as I'd expected.

04:07.178 --> 04:09.180
Yeah, well,
he's a stage "D,"

04:09.247 --> 04:11.616
and his condition's
deteriorating so rapidly...

04:11.682 --> 04:14.152
that the increased doses
hardly seem to help at all.

04:14.218 --> 04:16.154
What about brompton's?
No. No.

04:16.220 --> 04:18.589
Not till it's
absolutely necessary.

04:18.656 --> 04:21.559
And that might be
sooner than I'd hoped.

04:21.625 --> 04:23.561
Thanks for keeping
an eye on him.
Sure.

04:23.628 --> 04:25.563
<i>Helen?
Yeah?</i>

04:25.630 --> 04:28.399
Will you get me Arthur
Shaefer's chart, please?

Here you go.

Thank you.

04:38.576 --> 04:42.146
- Mr. Shaefer, good morning.
- Hello, Dr. Westphall.

04:42.213 --> 04:44.215
How are you today?
Fine.

04:44.282 --> 04:46.217
Good. Good.

04:46.284 --> 04:48.686
Dr. Cavanero tells me
you had a PRETTY rough Night.

04:48.753 --> 04:51.823
Who?
The doctor
who looked in on you.

04:51.889 --> 04:55.293
Oh. I can't remember much
about last night.

04:55.359 --> 04:57.829
I threw up a hell of a lot.
I know that.

04:57.895 --> 05:00.798
This chemotherapy Stuff's
for the birds.

05:00.865 --> 05:03.401
I mean, if I want
to spend a night like that,

05:03.468 --> 05:05.403
I'll head out drinkin'
with my brother Walt.

05:05.470 --> 05:07.405
At least then
I'd be havin' a good time.

05:07.472 --> 05:12.310
Well, hopefully,
the chemotherapy will
allow you to live Longer.

05:12.377 --> 05:15.380
Well, maybe,
but it hardly seems worth it.

05:15.446 --> 05:18.716
Mr. Shaefer, have you noticed
any changes in your vision...

05:18.783 --> 05:20.952
or Hearing since We increased
your pain medication?

05:21.018 --> 05:24.021
Any blackouts?
Not that I know of.

05:24.088 --> 05:28.092
How about dizziness?
I'm used to the room
Spinnin' around.

05:29.694 --> 05:31.629
Excuse me.
What?

05:31.696 --> 05:33.631
Just try to relax a bit.

05:33.698 --> 05:36.701
Now, I want you to take in
a deep breath and hold it.

05:36.768 --> 05:40.805
Let it go.
[ exhales ]

05:40.872 --> 05:44.042
I still got
the kidney thing, huh?
Tumor. Yeah.

05:44.108 --> 05:46.444
But since you haven't developed
any new symptoms,

05:46.511 --> 05:49.847
we're just gonna keep an eye
on the situation, all right?

05:49.914 --> 05:52.583
Well, whatever you say.

05:54.719 --> 05:57.021
What a day
to be out on a boat.

05:58.356 --> 06:01.225
I bet
the water's like glass.

06:02.560 --> 06:06.197
My brother and me been
lobstermen since we was kids.

06:06.264 --> 06:08.700
Got our own boat.

06:08.766 --> 06:11.369
Greatest thing in the world.

06:12.837 --> 06:16.174
Oh, what I wouldn't give
to go way out today.

06:16.240 --> 06:19.310
No lobsterin', no fishin'.

06:19.377 --> 06:22.346

06:22.413 --> 06:24.382

06:26.584 --> 06:29.520
<i>You get this
real peaceful feeling,</i>

06:29.587 --> 06:32.123

at the same time.

06:34.392 --> 06:37.195
You realize how small you are.

06:37.261 --> 06:41.532
I mean, you know,
compared to the whole ocean.

06:51.409 --> 06:54.011
What a face.
Like an Angel.

High protein.

I was such a jerk
at Craig's party.

07:07.458 --> 07:09.527
I'll never Stop kicking myself
for what happened.

07:09.594 --> 07:11.729
I mean, she really
helped me out of a jam.

07:11.796 --> 07:14.265
If you're still
hung up on Daniels,
ask her out again.

07:14.332 --> 07:16.968
Oh, you should've seen her.
She looked incredible.

07:17.035 --> 07:19.871
Ehrlich, you know what they say
about falling off a horse?

07:19.937 --> 07:23.074
The same thing
goes for a woman.

07:23.141 --> 07:26.244
Ooh, I'd love to find out.

07:26.310 --> 07:29.714
So then give it a shot.
What if she burns me?

07:32.483 --> 07:35.353

about gettin' a ride
with Some union boat?

What's that?

27:08.726 --> 27:11.095
Well, it's, uh--
It's a center.

27:11.162 --> 27:13.831
It's designed especially
for the terminally ill.

27:13.898 --> 27:17.135
And besides
medical treatment,

27:17.201 --> 27:19.370
your brother

27:19.437 --> 27:24.208
would Also be given emotional,
or spiritual Support.

27:25.777 --> 27:28.980
Um, it's--

27:29.047 --> 27:31.983
It's a kind of
a way station that...

27:32.050 --> 27:34.218
eases a person into
his own natural death.

27:37.055 --> 27:39.057
Thanks a lot, doctor.
I'll think about it.

27:42.827 --> 27:46.864
You know, doctor,
when Artie and I
were in our prime,

27:46.931 --> 27:49.600
we used to go lobsterin'
six days a week,

27:49.667 --> 27:52.070
10, 12 hours a day.

27:52.136 --> 27:54.906
Sometimes We'd bring back
hundreds at a time.

27:54.972 --> 27:58.509
Not the little ones.
I'm talkin' about
the granddaddies, the big ones.

27:58.576 --> 28:00.845
We were really somethin'.

28:00.912 --> 28:03.347
Then those big companies
with their unions come in.

28:03.414 --> 28:07.418
They tried to drive us out,
and we fought back like hell.

28:07.485 --> 28:09.687
We kept our self-Respect.

28:09.754 --> 28:13.858
And that's about
all we've got today--
our boat and our self-Respect.

28:30.541 --> 28:33.778
I'm glad you stopped in.
I want to talk to you.

28:33.845 --> 28:37.782
I've had a complaint from
one of my nurses about a story
you've been spreading.

28:37.849 --> 28:42.954
Something about, um,
brief life expectancy
for the patients on ward 5.

28:43.020 --> 28:44.956
If you're talking
about nurse Roberts--

28:45.022 --> 28:47.425
Statements like that
are unnecessary.

28:47.492 --> 28:50.762
They damage reputations
and are very unprofessional.

28:50.828 --> 28:52.764
With all the malpractice suits
around these days,

28:52.830 --> 28:55.967
I'd have thought you'd
have been more careful about
damning somebody Else's Work.

28:56.034 --> 28:58.236
Look, Helen--
May I suggest, doctor,

28:58.302 --> 29:02.306
that in the future,
you channel your discontent
in more appropriate directions.

29:02.373 --> 29:05.543
If you do have a complaint
against any member
of my nursing staff,

29:05.610 --> 29:09.080
would you please come to me
and not broadcast it
to the entire hospital?

29:39.077 --> 29:42.380

29:44.582 --> 29:47.919
And it was positive.
I've decided to have
a mastectomy.

39:42.980 --> 39:44.916
- Mom?
- Mm-hmm?

39:44.982 --> 39:49.220
- Which one is it?
- It's this one, Darling.

39:50.988 --> 39:54.092
- and they're gonna cut it off?
- Yes.

39:54.158 --> 39:58.996
- Well, where's the lump?
- It's right here, honey.

39:59.063 --> 40:01.099
Come here.
I want you to feel it.

40:01.165 --> 40:04.569
Come on.
Don't be frightened, sweetie.

40:04.635 --> 40:06.604
Come here.

40:08.005 --> 40:10.007
There.
Can you feel it?

40:12.443 --> 40:15.079
That's why they've
got to do this.

40:21.652 --> 40:23.955
You make sure everybody behaves
while I'm gone, okay?

40:24.021 --> 40:26.324
Yeah. I will.

40:28.760 --> 40:31.662

40:56.654 --> 40:59.157
Are you all right?
Trying to impress your date?

40:59.223 --> 41:01.159
Sorry.
Hi, Victor.

41:01.225 --> 41:03.861
Shirley,
I'm sorry about tonight.
It's okay. I understand.

41:03.928 --> 41:05.863
Mmm. So did you
guys have a good time?

41:05.930 --> 41:07.432
It was great.
Yeah.

41:07.498 --> 41:09.000
Where'd you go?
Grimsley's.

41:09.067 --> 41:11.035
Grimsley's?
Have you been there?

41:11.102 --> 41:14.405
No.
Oh, it's marvelous.
Very romantic.

41:14.472 --> 41:17.608
The food was fabulous,
and Wayne picked out
a great bottle of wine.

41:17.675 --> 41:20.611
Just a hint
of Impertinence.
Yeah.

41:20.678 --> 41:22.613
Then we went dancing.
We really had fun.

41:22.680 --> 41:26.551
And I also learned
something tonight.
Me too.

41:26.617 --> 41:28.953
Underneath this glib,
happy-Go-Lucky exterior...

41:29.020 --> 41:31.622
beats the heart of a warm,
sensitive person.

41:31.689 --> 41:33.925
There's a Wayne Fiscus in there
nobody knows.

41:33.991 --> 41:36.094
Some of us are a little
slower than others.

41:37.261 --> 41:39.197
Mmm.
[ Clears throat ]

41:39.263 --> 41:41.499
listen, Ehrlich,
this was supposed
to be your date,

41:41.566 --> 41:44.435
So, uh, why don't you take
Shirley home?

41:44.502 --> 41:46.904
<i>No, I've had a hard day.
I'm no fun.
Come on.</i>

41:46.971 --> 41:48.906
I'll invite you up
for a nightcap.
I don't know.

41:48.973 --> 41:51.909
Go ahead. Besides,
we got the limo
for the rest of the night.

41:51.976 --> 41:54.045
Limo?
What, are you crazy?

41:54.112 --> 41:56.414
You were supposed
to cover for me,
not blow me out of the water.

41:56.481 --> 42:00.284
No, Victor. It's not like that.
See, there was this old guy
at the restaurant--

42:00.351 --> 42:02.520
I'll explain on the way.
Come on.

42:02.587 --> 42:05.289
I'll get my coat.

42:05.356 --> 42:07.392
Good night, Wayne.
I had a really good time.

42:07.458 --> 42:09.427
Me too, Shirl.

42:11.095 --> 42:13.097
Good night.
This has been quite an evening.

42:13.164 --> 42:17.168
It really was.
What, are you nuts?
Give me my coat!

42:17.235 --> 42:20.038
That's my Scarf.
Let's go, doctor.

42:21.272 --> 42:23.975
Don't forget to tell him
about the free dinner.

42:24.042 --> 42:25.943
[ sighs ]

43:17.695 --> 43:19.630
how are you feeling
today, Arthur?

43:19.697 --> 43:22.200
Walter.

43:23.768 --> 43:27.238
Aw, it's a beautiful day
outside.

43:27.305 --> 43:30.208
I couldn't sleep so good
last night.
I'm kinda glad too,

43:31.442 --> 43:34.579
because I was awake
for the sunrise.

43:34.645 --> 43:36.581
Oh, you should've seen it.

43:36.647 --> 43:41.986
It started out purple,
then turned pink, then orange.

43:42.053 --> 43:45.056
And when the sun
Rose out of the water,

43:45.123 --> 43:49.994
it glowed so strong
it hurt my eyes.

43:50.061 --> 43:53.097
Not a cloud in the sky either.

43:53.164 --> 43:56.034
You know,
there's something about...

43:56.100 --> 43:59.037
a real cold air...

43:59.103 --> 44:02.907
and a bright sun
that makes you feel strong.

44:04.342 --> 44:07.578
Everything is so Crisp
and clear.

44:07.645 --> 44:11.916
Your body tingles, and you--
You feel kinda drunk.

44:17.021 --> 44:19.524
I've been thinking about
what you said to me yesterday.

44:23.261 --> 44:25.830
Here.

44:25.897 --> 44:27.865
Look what I brought.

44:30.635 --> 44:33.171
You remember this?

44:33.237 --> 44:35.306
You remember
when you gave it to me?

44:36.374 --> 44:39.143
My 21st birthday.

44:39.210 --> 44:41.412
Oh, boy. I...

44:41.479 --> 44:45.016
wish we had a dime
for every duck we got
with this beauty.

44:49.687 --> 44:53.124
You are closer to me...

44:53.191 --> 44:55.159
than anyone, Arthur.

44:56.427 --> 44:58.696
Even my wife.

45:02.066 --> 45:04.969
You and I've been each other's
best friends all our lives.

45:08.005 --> 45:11.008
<i>Even those bad Times were good.</i>

Had to stoke the furnace.

about last night.</i>

Hey, don't worry about it, man.
It's okay.

No, you don't understand.
I wasn't trying to stab you
in the back.

47:02.353 --> 47:04.889
I mean, we just happened
to hit it off.
Hit it off?

47:04.956 --> 47:07.258
That's an understatement.
All she did was talk about,

47:07.325 --> 47:10.261
"Wayne did this,
Wayne did that."
It's weird for me too.

47:10.328 --> 47:12.263
I mean, I worked with
this woman for almost a year,

47:12.330 --> 47:16.467
and I never knew
what she was like.
So now you know.

47:16.534 --> 47:20.271
So, uh, when are you
gonna ask her out again?
Don't be a twerp.

I'm not gonna Horn in
on your action.

kind of like me, huh?
Yes, Fiscus.

Yes, Fiscus.

Look, what can I do
to make it up to you?
Forget it.
