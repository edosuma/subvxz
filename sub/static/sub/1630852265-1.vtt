[all sigh]

1:04:16.250 --> 1:04:19.583
Ugh, boy. [chuckles]
So glad he's gone, right?

1:04:19.666 --> 1:04:21.291
Did he seem kinda clingy to you?

1:04:21.375 --> 1:04:22.333
Not really.

1:04:22.416 --> 1:04:24.250
Yeah, no, he was definitely clingy.

1:04:24.333 --> 1:04:26.625
I mean, he hides it,
but he is gonna miss me.

1:04:26.708 --> 1:04:29.875
I mean, us.
He is gonna… he's gonna miss us.

1:04:31.875 --> 1:04:34.208
It's okay if you miss him too, Maddie.

1:04:34.791 --> 1:04:36.208
[laughs] Are you kidding?

1:04:36.291 --> 1:04:39.166
You know that he's actually a marsupial?
Not even a bear.

1:04:39.250 --> 1:04:41.208
[laughing] Ridiculous! [snorts]

1:04:41.291 --> 1:04:43.583
Now let's find those mountains. [chuckles]

I can smell it.

1:04:56.708 --> 1:04:59.875
It smells like… home.

1:05:01.208 --> 1:05:05.041
[Nigel] Everyone, look!
It's the mountains Jackie told us about!

1:05:05.125 --> 1:05:06.875
[Zoe] They're so big.

1:05:06.958 --> 1:05:08.083
[Frank] And mountainy.

1:05:08.166 --> 1:05:10.541
And burnt sienna-y.

1:05:11.375 --> 1:05:13.208
[chuckling] What are we waiting for?

1:05:13.291 --> 1:05:16.625
Last one in's a deadly,
disgusting, venomous creature! Whoo-hoo!

1:05:19.041 --> 1:05:22.750
[Frank] Wow! Feel that sand, guys.
That's genuine outback sand.

1:05:22.833 --> 1:05:24.583
And the rocks aren't plastic.

1:05:24.666 --> 1:05:25.541

1:05:36.166 --> 1:05:38.041
Look! A welcoming committee.

They look just like us.

mating season ended yesterday.

1:06:27.166 --> 1:06:28.208
Oh.

1:06:31.958 --> 1:06:34.041
Do you think they know
we're from the city?

1:06:34.125 --> 1:06:37.583
I love what you've done to the place.
The colors are so organic and textural.

1:06:37.666 --> 1:06:38.875
[scoffs] They do now.

1:06:42.208 --> 1:06:46.083
Ugh. Nice one, Nigel.
You scared away the welcoming committee.

Where's Maddie?

1:07:12.875 --> 1:07:14.541
Everyone, spread out.

1:07:15.083 --> 1:07:19.041
I want them alive,
so tranquilizer darts only.

Please!

We have to go after them.

-[all gasp]
-No. It looks way too scary out there.

1:09:35.958 --> 1:09:41.333
But you're supposed to be our families.
You're the reason we came all this way.

1:09:41.416 --> 1:09:44.833
Sorry, love,
but none of us have ever left before.

1:09:44.916 --> 1:09:46.833
Then it's about time you did!

1:09:46.916 --> 1:09:49.333
Yeah! And if you don't help us,
we'll rip you apart

1:09:49.416 --> 1:09:50.958
and turn you into a pair of shoes!

1:09:51.041 --> 1:09:53.291
-Pretty Boy?
-Not a nice pair of shoes either.

1:09:53.375 --> 1:09:54.708
The cheap, nasty kind!

1:09:54.791 --> 1:09:58.291
Yeah, I'm talking to you, brown snake!
Don't you turn your backs on--

1:09:58.833 --> 1:10:01.500
They turned their backs.
Yep, they're definitely gone.

1:10:01.583 --> 1:10:03.375
I should've kept my mouth shut, right?

1:10:03.458 --> 1:10:06.875
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you with the other koalas?

1:10:06.958 --> 1:10:09.625
Yeah, nah, that…
Yeah, that didn't really work out.

1:10:09.708 --> 1:10:11.791
Just wasn't what I thought
it was going to be.

1:10:11.875 --> 1:10:14.750
She's my best friend, but did you see
how many gumnuts she ate?

1:10:14.833 --> 1:10:17.958
Sorry. That is not fur. That is fat.
We need to kick her out of the tree.

1:10:18.041 --> 1:10:21.458
Be honest. Do you think
koalas can be a little bit shallow?

1:10:21.541 --> 1:10:23.375
-Um…
-I don't belong with them.

1:10:23.458 --> 1:10:28.916
In fact, it kinda feels like
the only place I do belong is… with you.

1:10:30.416 --> 1:10:31.541
Really?

1:10:31.625 --> 1:10:33.625
[chuckling] Yeah. How messed up is that?

1:10:34.291 --> 1:10:36.875

I leave you alone for two minutes,

1:10:36.958 --> 1:10:39.000
and you let the guys get captured.

1:10:39.083 --> 1:10:42.250

Get them back, of course.

1:10:52.708 --> 1:10:53.916

1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:57.125

-No, U.S.S.

The Uglies Secret Society?

1:11:01.208 --> 1:11:03.500
I don't know.
Maybe it's time we changed that name.

1:11:03.583 --> 1:11:06.625
How does
the Unique and Special Society sound?

1:11:07.208 --> 1:11:09.500
-Sounds like U.S.S.
