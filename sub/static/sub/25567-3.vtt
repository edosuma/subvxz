Are you going to follow in
mommy's footsteps

01:34.344 --> 01:36.179
I'm even trying out for a new team,

03:17.989 --> 03:20.491
People love to see kids being destroyed.

03:20.575 --> 03:23.494
The audience went wild
when Leon trashed that little girl.

03:23.578 --> 03:25.246
Yeah, I heard. It was horrible.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.832
Yeah, but I can be a lot worse.
Of course I can.

[Samantha] If the crowd wants blood,
I'll give it to them.

03:30.585 --> 03:33.630
You heard when Lenny said
I could get my own show, right?

03:33.713 --> 03:36.674
-She never said that.
-Not with those exact words, Dodoi.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.345
I heard when she talked about your weight.

03:40.428 --> 03:41.596
You talked about that!

If you want to play soccer again,
you have to make sacrifices.

Now the team is reconsidering if it's
a good idea to hire an obese athlete.

All right. You're totally right, sorry.

10:49.148 --> 10:51.317
We need a faster method.

10:52.526 --> 10:56.947
<i>Slim-Diet will eliminate</i>
<i>all the extra weight in your body.</i>

10:57.031 --> 10:59.450
<i>And you know what?</i>
<i>It will eliminate much more!</i>

10:59.533 --> 11:03.287
<i>Use Slim-Diet and you'll feel</i>
<i>like you're in a dream!</i>

11:03.371 --> 11:06.415
<i>Feel silly during the day, why feel sad?</i>

11:06.499 --> 11:07.833
<i>Slim-Diet.</i>

11:07.917 --> 11:11.504
<i>Run to the drugstore</i>
<i>while it's still legal!</i>

11:11.587 --> 11:12.797
Do you trust me?

11:14.924 --> 11:16.300
Does it really work, Soraya?

11:16.384 --> 11:18.803
-Of course it does!
-How many do I have to take a day?

11:18.886 --> 11:20.763
-Eight.
-You're messing up the script.

11:20.846 --> 11:24.433
Every judge has a clear role.
We all know I'm the "evil queen,"

11:24.517 --> 11:26.102
Soraya is the "mother figure,"

11:26.185 --> 11:28.646
and you're the "cute vocation co-worker." I'm nobody's co-worker, Leon,
and much less cute.

11:31.273 --> 11:32.858
You think Soraya is motherly?

11:32.942 --> 11:35.945
Of course I'm motherly!
I take medication for that.

11:36.028 --> 11:39.490
This woman here answered to three murders
and, damn it, I'm not gay!

11:39.573 --> 11:40.533
What's up, Leon?

11:40.825 --> 11:44.245
You think I'm going to take your place?
I don't want to be a judge, baby!

11:44.328 --> 11:46.247
I have enough talent to have my own show.

11:46.330 --> 11:48.666
This one has been in need of a new face
for a while.

11:48.749 --> 11:51.669
Your face hasn't been new in 20 years,
sweetie. Shame on you!

11:51.752 --> 11:54.255
Listen, you thug:
either stop playing the villain

11:54.338 --> 11:58.467
or you'll never set foot in this network
ever again. Not even to do commercials.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.761
And Slim-Diet really works, OK?

12:00.845 --> 12:02.513
-[Cindy] Mom!
-[Samantha] Hey!

12:02.596 --> 12:03.431
[Leon] "Mom"?

12:03.848 --> 12:05.099
She's your daughter?

12:05.182 --> 12:07.351
So different from you!

12:08.561 --> 12:09.603
I like her.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.439
My princess!

12:11.522 --> 12:14.525
I'm not your princess!
Mom, look what they did to me!

12:14.608 --> 12:17.778
Cindy! They waxed your upper lip!

12:17.862 --> 12:19.864
Soraya, it looks great!

12:19.947 --> 12:22.825
I always tell her I started doing mine
when I was six.

12:22.908 --> 12:25.453
-You look beautiful.
-This mouse is my Cinderella!

12:25.536 --> 12:27.538
Go, go, before it's midnight!

12:27.621 --> 12:30.458
-[Soraya] Go on, pumpkin!
-Cindy doesn't care about her look.

12:30.541 --> 12:33.252
She's the smart one, right, my love?
Say something.

12:34.628 --> 12:37.423
[quietly] Go fix this,
because it's no good.

12:37.506 --> 12:40.509
I was like her when I was little.
Timid, rarely said anything.

12:41.177 --> 12:44.013
Can you make me look like the other girls?

12:46.682 --> 12:49.560
-Brandon, no.
-You said you wanted to play soccer again.

12:49.643 --> 12:52.271
Because I wanted to be
an example for you guys.

12:52.354 --> 12:53.898
But if we have to break in...

12:53.981 --> 12:57.485
Samantha made me fake
an epileptic seizure!

12:57.818 --> 12:58.736
[Brandon] Relax.

12:58.819 --> 12:59.695

12:59.778 --> 13:02.907
[Dodoi] Hey, boy, I'm your father.
I'm worried about me!

13:03.657 --> 13:06.619
-[Dodoi] Your mom will kill me.
-[Brandon] Relax, it's OK!

13:08.913 --> 13:11.624
-[Brandon] Look how cute!

13:11.707 --> 13:14.043

These little ones are bloodthirsty.

13:15.294 --> 13:18.464
[Brandon] Give him your hand to bite
and I'll grab the purse!

[Dodoi, singing] <i> Always Flamengo!</i>
<i>Flamengo I will always be</i>

I have a police record.

13:32.603 --> 13:34.605
Found it! Didn't I tell you?

13:35.314 --> 13:38.359
Samantha will be proud
if you stay in shape.

13:38.859 --> 13:41.153
-[Brandon] Here!
-If she leaves me alone...

you should learn how to talk! Diction!

Diction!

13:53.082 --> 13:55.292
I know why your diction
is so bad, my love!

13:55.376 --> 13:57.545
There's a live cat

Yes!

14:08.222 --> 14:09.515
[Soraya] Yes!

14:10.015 --> 14:12.643

Honey, get him to buy it back!

14:14.645 --> 14:17.690
[Samantha] At least while you sing,
everyone can eat ribs, right?

14:17.773 --> 14:20.317

14:20.401 --> 14:22.695
You think you're the hottest thing,
Samantha?

14:22.778 --> 14:25.698
This arrogance of yours
is what will bring you down.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.284
It's always brought you down.

Do you like it? Am I too evil? Tell me!

15:16.582 --> 15:19.293
No, not evil at all, you're really sweet!

15:19.376 --> 15:21.420
What do you mean by "sweet", Brandon?

15:22.004 --> 15:24.590

-Dad, don't I look pretty?
-Honey, you're beautiful!

21:54.604 --> 21:56.064
Beautiful, right?

21:56.148 --> 21:59.609
[Dodoi] Honey, there was one time
that daddy's team was losing

21:59.693 --> 22:01.486
and I was on the bench.

22:01.570 --> 22:04.406
They gave me a yellow card,
I was wounded, drunk, get it?

22:04.489 --> 22:06.992
But the coach told me
to get on the pitch and play.

22:07.075 --> 22:10.245
-And you won?
-We lost 5-0! But that doesn't matter.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.664
What matters is that
I did my best, understand?

22:13.832 --> 22:14.666
OK?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.793
Let's go, funny girl! It's your turn.

22:16.877 --> 22:18.837
Go on. But take off that...

22:19.171 --> 22:20.005
Just go!

At school, when you lose,
at least you get a consolation prize.

24:14.744 --> 24:18.498
Your mom didn't lose, she was kicked out.
Didn't you see the security guards?

24:18.832 --> 24:20.041
Thanks, Dodoi.

I can't do it anymore.
I'm not going to play soccer again.

OK. Yeah, yeah.

24:40.520 --> 24:43.231
I can't believe I got kicked off
that dumb show.

24:43.315 --> 24:46.484
Relax. Cindy says
no one watches TV anymore.

24:47.777 --> 24:50.113
Everyone's talking about it.
But you know what?

24:50.197 --> 24:52.199
You're right. Who cares?

24:53.992 --> 24:55.327
[Dodoi] Hmm.

24:57.078 --> 24:58.580
Wait, Dodoi.

24:58.663 --> 25:00.665
Calm down, I'm gonna get in shape.

25:00.749 --> 25:03.919
No, that has nothing to do with it.
That's not the problem.

25:04.836 --> 25:06.379
You know what I want to tell you?

25:07.339 --> 25:12.052
If you think time has passed for you
and you don't want to play anymore, OK.

25:12.510 --> 25:14.512
You still have to find something to do.
