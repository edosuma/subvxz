[Zoe] <i>Somewhere, underneath all this,</i>
<i>there's a tack room.</i>

00:38.760 --> 00:41.400
<i>The annual stable's barn dance is tonight,</i>

00:41.480 --> 00:44.360
<i>and around here,
that seems to be a pretty big deal.</i>

00:44.440 --> 00:45.960
Think prom, but with more ponies.

00:48.160 --> 00:52.040
This one I call
my "Oh, this old thing?" dress.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.000
Cost: 3 pounds
from a secondhand clothes shop.

00:54.080 --> 00:55.560
Wow factor: ten out of ten.

00:56.120 --> 00:57.720
It's... It's okay.

00:58.320 --> 01:00.240
Don't insult the dress. It can hear you.

01:01.960 --> 01:03.360
It's not "okay," it's perfect.

01:03.920 --> 01:05.200
Shoes. You need shoes.

01:05.960 --> 01:08.280
- Ooh. Excited much?
- It's the barn dance.

01:08.680 --> 01:10.760
We're gonna drink punch
and eat mini-burgers,

01:10.840 --> 01:13.640
and break into a musical dance number
we somehow all know the moves to.

01:13.720 --> 01:16.120
Becky, you know
that's just in movies, right?

01:18.000 --> 01:21.160
And then, when we're really old,
we're gonna look back, thinking:

01:21.240 --> 01:25.120
"Oh, that was the night I danced
with so-and-so, and look at us now,

01:25.200 --> 01:26.880
married 150 years."

01:26.960 --> 01:29.680
Yeah. Except none of us
actually have any dates.

01:29.760 --> 01:32.960
So, you guys, funny thing is...

01:33.240 --> 01:35.920
um, I actually asked Pin to the dance.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.520
What? You and Pin?

01:39.400 --> 01:43.240
- That's not part of the movie.
- I mean, it's not a date.

01:43.320 --> 01:45.600
We're just going as friends.
We're friends.

01:49.480 --> 01:52.240
So, I hear you and Zoe are going
to the dance together.

01:52.960 --> 01:54.800
I know it's not a real date, but...

01:56.040 --> 01:58.720
Oh, I thought you knew.

02:00.880 --> 02:01.800
Knew what?

02:01.880 --> 02:04.360
Zoe only asked you
because she felt sorry for you.

02:05.720 --> 02:08.600
- Can't help but make trouble, can you?
- I'm not making trouble.

02:08.680 --> 02:10.760
I just don't want them
to make a fool of you.

02:12.080 --> 02:14.280
It was all a bit of a joke, apparently.

02:15.120 --> 02:18.280
Zoe told Becky and Jade
how you needed to lighten up, and...

02:19.320 --> 02:23.200
they came up with this silly idea
about asking you to the dance.

02:23.800 --> 02:24.800
Is that true?

02:26.040 --> 02:27.040
Susie heard them.

02:28.160 --> 02:31.440
I was so upset when she told me.

02:31.520 --> 02:33.120
You deserve better.

02:40.960 --> 02:41.960
Morning.

02:43.560 --> 02:45.080
What exactly is going on here?

02:45.160 --> 02:46.920
Ted just popped by to say hello.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.960
Well, you must be finished by now.
Hello is only one word.

02:50.040 --> 02:51.160
Rosie.

02:53.360 --> 02:56.320
I'm sorry. I just know
you have a lot of work to do.

02:57.040 --> 02:58.920
Tonight, being the barn dance and all.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.960
[Ted] She's right. I best get going.

03:01.640 --> 03:04.240
I'll pop back later
and get those things sorted for your dad.

03:04.320 --> 03:05.920
Oh, thanks. He'd appreciate it.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.400
As would I. I'll see you out.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.840
- [Frank] Good to see you, Ted.
- [Ted] Bye, Frank.

03:17.320 --> 03:19.320
[indistinct chatter]

03:20.520 --> 03:23.120
- [Ted] See you later.
- [Maggie chuckling] See you later then.

03:23.200 --> 03:25.720
They were quite the couple
when they were young.

03:25.800 --> 03:26.720
[engine starts]

03:26.800 --> 03:28.720
Broke Ted's heart when your mom left.

03:30.400 --> 03:33.000
- I'll see you later, Gramps.
- Off to the stables?

03:33.440 --> 03:35.960
- Yeah, I think Ted needs my help...
- Ah.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.680
To stay away from my mom.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.280
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

03:45.360 --> 03:48.240
Okay, Marcus, I did something
and I know you might not like it,

03:48.320 --> 03:51.040
but I just had to tell you:
I rode Raven last night.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.800
No, like, I actually rode him.
Out in the fields.

03:54.880 --> 03:56.960
That's great. It's a big step for you.

03:57.040 --> 03:59.680
Did you miss the part
where I said I rode Raven?

04:02.240 --> 04:04.480
I'm not a charity case, all right?

04:06.160 --> 04:07.160
Excuse me.

04:08.400 --> 04:09.400
Pin.

04:09.440 --> 04:11.600
Mia told me
why you asked me to the dance.

04:13.280 --> 04:14.280
You feel sorry for me.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.280
What? No, no, no. It's not like that...

04:16.360 --> 04:17.720
Susie heard you, Zoe.

04:18.720 --> 04:20.001
Apparently I need to lighten up.

04:20.080 --> 04:23.080
- Okay, I said that, but I...
- I don't need you to look down on me.

04:23.160 --> 04:24.760
I don't look down on you.

04:26.520 --> 04:28.720
- I'm not coming to the dance with you.
- But...

04:28.800 --> 04:31.800
I'm doing you a favor.
Now you can go with Mr. Perfect.

04:41.400 --> 04:42.720
[neighs]

04:44.240 --> 04:45.840
Bob. Can this day get any worse?

04:47.280 --> 04:48.320
No.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.880
I'm gonna search it and prove it to you.

04:52.960 --> 04:56.080
Good news is that off-the-shoulder
is in season, bad news is...

04:56.160 --> 04:59.600
- Ghost Pony died 500 years ago today.
- What do you want me to do? Send flowers?

04:59.680 --> 05:02.360
- What if it comes back tonight?
- And what if it's not real?

05:02.440 --> 05:05.200
What if we're in a spook-opalypse?
No one is safe!

05:06.240 --> 05:07.280
G.P. made me do that.

05:07.360 --> 05:09.160
The Ghost Pony made you clumsy, did it?

05:09.240 --> 05:10.960
Hey, guys, we can fix it.

05:11.040 --> 05:12.960
Don't touch it. It might be haunted.

05:13.040 --> 05:15.280
- Can you just drop it?
- I already did.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
You owe me a new one.

05:17.040 --> 05:19.600
If we don't deal with this now,
you're gonna owe me a new soul.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.040
[both] Zoe, tell her!

05:21.120 --> 05:22.200
Um...

05:22.960 --> 05:23.840
Well...

05:23.920 --> 05:25.640
[Zoe] <i>Okay. What I want to say is:</i>

05:25.720 --> 05:27.840
<i>"Jade, you can get a new screen online.</i>

05:27.920 --> 05:30.120
<i>And, Becky, there is no Ghost Pony."</i>

05:30.920 --> 05:33.680
<i>But what I should say is:</i>

05:33.760 --> 05:37.280
You girls are both right
in your own way.

05:37.360 --> 05:39.680
<i>Oh, diplomatic. I like it.</i>

05:39.920 --> 05:40.920
Seriously?

05:42.520 --> 05:44.920
I thought I could rely on you
for a sensible answer.

05:47.320 --> 05:49.040
I thought you believed in Ghost Pony.

05:49.120 --> 05:50.760
Okay, wait, what?

06:01.960 --> 06:05.880
Okay, that's not the face of someone
who's about to ride their favorite horse.

06:05.960 --> 06:06.960
[chuckles]

06:07.400 --> 06:09.280
I upset Jade and Becky.

06:10.320 --> 06:11.880
Mmm, Pin hates me.

06:11.960 --> 06:14.240
Marcus is being very... British.

06:15.040 --> 06:17.480
And Bob ate my prom dress.

06:17.560 --> 06:20.440
[chuckles] I thought
my life was complicated.

06:20.520 --> 06:21.520
[chuckles]

06:22.160 --> 06:24.720
Look, Zoe,
it's not the mistakes that matter.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.000
It's what you do about them that counts.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.160
Why don't you two show me
what you can do?

06:32.800 --> 06:33.800
Okay.

06:34.640 --> 06:35.640
Okay.

06:37.520 --> 06:38.520
Come on, Raven.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.280
Steady now. Good boy.

06:44.920 --> 06:46.880
That's it! Good boy.

06:53.640 --> 06:55.320
Come on. Just give it a go.

06:55.400 --> 06:56.400
[snorts]

06:59.920 --> 07:02.440
- We got this.
- [neighs]

07:02.520 --> 07:04.560
- All right. Come on, come on.
- [clicks tongue]

07:08.520 --> 07:10.800
[whinnying]

07:10.880 --> 07:11.920
[Zoe] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.320
Hey. It's okay.

07:15.480 --> 07:19.440
- Still not a fan of the water jump, then?
- I wanted you to see how good we are.

07:19.520 --> 07:22.520
Are you serious?
Water jump or no water jump,

07:22.600 --> 07:25.960
Raven is a different horse,
and that's all because of you.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.600
I am so proud of you, Zoe.

07:29.320 --> 07:31.560
However,
you're not getting off that easily.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.360
Go around. Try again.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.680
Uh... Okay.

07:44.360 --> 07:45.360
This is it?

07:46.480 --> 07:47.840
This is the barn dance?

07:47.920 --> 07:51.680
Don't worry, I'll rake up most of the poo
before the dancing starts.

07:51.760 --> 07:53.640
Where are the rest of the decorations?

07:53.720 --> 07:57.120
Uh, we don't have many
since Bob got into the storage shed.

07:57.200 --> 08:00.680
Right. Just a few more bits to do.

08:00.760 --> 08:03.040
- Wait, what?
- I'll be done here in a minute.

08:05.600 --> 08:06.800
We can't let him finish.

08:07.200 --> 08:10.400
- We have to keep him away from my mom.
- Does the lady need an evil plan?

08:11.040 --> 08:12.280
Yes, indeed.

08:12.360 --> 08:14.360
Becky's blog: the old barn.

08:14.440 --> 08:16.360
<i>Okay, the time has come.</i>

08:16.760 --> 08:19.920
<i>I'm going to prove, once and for all,
that Ghost Pony exists.</i>

08:20.240 --> 08:21.360
<i>Observe.</i>

08:21.600 --> 08:24.400
<i>Carrots, which no horse can resist.</i>

08:24.920 --> 08:27.920
<i>Especially if they're a ghost
that hasn't eaten for 500 years.</i>

08:28.120 --> 08:30.560
<i>And as we all know,
carrots glow in the dark,</i>

08:30.800 --> 08:33.200
<i>so they are particularly attractive
to ghosts.</i>

08:34.080 --> 08:35.680
<i>How's that for science, Jade?</i>

08:36.840 --> 08:38.920
<i>I plan to lure the Ghost Pony
into this barn,</i>

08:39.000 --> 08:40.720
and then catch him using this net.

08:42.640 --> 08:45.040
<i>I can only assume that he has
a death ray or laser vision,</i>

08:45.120 --> 08:46.520
<i>so I've brought protection.</i>

08:49.040 --> 08:50.720
<i>Things are about to get real.</i>

08:51.240 --> 08:53.920
Okay, I want lanterns,
and drapey things, and lights.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.560
Lots and lots of lights.

08:55.640 --> 08:59.240
[sighs] Look, Rosie, I've finished.

08:59.320 --> 09:00.360
This is all we've got.

09:00.440 --> 09:03.480
Ted, Ted, Ted. There's something
that you should know about me.

09:03.560 --> 09:04.440
What's that?

09:04.520 --> 09:06.720
Party planning is my superpower.

09:07.320 --> 09:08.800
Delivery for Miss Rosie Phillips.

09:10.120 --> 09:11.120
Bring them in!

09:12.800 --> 09:15.360
I ordered a few more decorations.
I hope you don't mind.

09:15.920 --> 09:18.040
You know who else used
to boss me about like this?

09:18.120 --> 09:19.200
Your mom.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.880
Looks like you have a new boss now.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.200
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.640
Did you see Ted at the stables?

09:35.920 --> 09:36.920
Mm-mm.

09:37.680 --> 09:39.720
I wonder why he hasn't come back
to fix the door.

09:39.800 --> 09:41.280
Maybe something came up.

09:41.520 --> 09:44.960
No. When Ted says he's going
to do something, he does it.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.920
- He's always looked out for me.
- [scoffs]

09:47.000 --> 09:49.640
Yeah, that was when he was
in love with you.

09:51.880 --> 09:53.360
Sorry, Mom, but you lost your touch.

09:53.440 --> 09:55.680
[laughing]

09:56.920 --> 09:59.240
- Mm. Yeah, you're probably right.
- [babbles]

10:01.440 --> 10:04.480
Meanwhile, my daughter has
two boys fighting over her.

10:04.560 --> 10:05.640
[groans]

10:05.720 --> 10:07.400
Can we not talk boys right now?

10:07.880 --> 10:09.960
My barn dance plans
are kind of falling apart.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.240
Are you still going?

10:11.320 --> 10:12.840
I don't even have a dress.

10:15.120 --> 10:16.520
I might be able to help you there.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.440
I wore it for my school dance.

10:25.960 --> 10:28.040
It was the most beautiful thing
I'd ever seen.

10:28.120 --> 10:30.120
Yeah. No offense, Mom,

10:30.200 --> 10:32.960
but weren't you born before style began?

10:36.240 --> 10:38.320
All right, let's take a look.

10:41.480 --> 10:45.000
- [laughs] It's actually cute.
- Don't sound so surprised.

10:45.680 --> 10:46.880
See if it fits.

10:49.920 --> 10:52.200
Oh, Ted, you need to fix this.

10:52.680 --> 10:55.000
- We don't want droopy lighting.
- [sighs]

10:55.080 --> 10:58.600
Rosie, I told your mom
I'd help her fix some stuff.

10:58.680 --> 11:02.440
Oh, she's probably forgotten about you.
She's really scatter-brained these days.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.960
- I... I should let her know I'll be late.
- No!

11:05.800 --> 11:06.800
Um...

11:07.360 --> 11:10.440
- I mean, there's still so much to do.
- Well, half an hour won't hurt.

11:10.520 --> 11:13.800
Okay, 30 minutes is the difference
between boring and bling-tastic.

11:13.880 --> 11:16.240
- I won't be long.
- Fine!

11:16.720 --> 11:19.440
Go see my mom,
have a cup of tea, get married.

11:19.960 --> 11:20.960
See if I care.

11:32.880 --> 11:35.000
I have to do everything myself, don't I?

11:40.760 --> 11:41.880
Okay...

11:43.760 --> 11:44.760
All right.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.480
[screams, whimpers]

11:49.240 --> 11:51.000
Someone, help!

11:52.520 --> 11:53.520
Quickly!

11:54.680 --> 11:56.000
[screams]

11:56.760 --> 11:58.880
- You okay?
- I'm alive. [chuckles]

12:01.160 --> 12:02.480
Thanks a lot.

12:02.560 --> 12:04.440
Now you're gonna tell me
what's really going on

12:04.520 --> 12:06.120
and why you're keeping me here.

12:07.280 --> 12:08.280
[sighs]

12:12.720 --> 12:13.920
Oh, Zoe.

12:16.680 --> 12:17.680
How do I look?

12:19.160 --> 12:20.520
Wait, something's missing.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.520
It's beautiful. It's an emerald.

12:36.560 --> 12:39.280
Go to the dance, enjoy yourself.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.120
Friends, boys...

12:42.920 --> 12:44.600
Things have a way of working out.

12:49.400 --> 12:53.000
<i>Okay. So, I went to have a look around,
and when I came back, I saw this.</i>

12:56.480 --> 12:59.600
<i>Something has been eating them.
I think my trap is working.</i>

13:00.080 --> 13:01.400
<i>Ghost Pony is among us.</i>

13:02.600 --> 13:03.600
<i>Among me.</i>

13:04.800 --> 13:06.440
- <i>Ghost Pony is here.</i>
- [rustling]

13:07.400 --> 13:08.400
<i>What was that?</i>

13:21.840 --> 13:23.280
[line ringing]

13:25.680 --> 13:27.240
<i>- Hi, this is Becky...</i>

13:27.320 --> 13:29.561
[Becky] <i>and Bob.</i>
<i>We're on a hack, so we'll call you back!</i>

13:29.600 --> 13:32.840
It's me.
Look, this is getting really silly.

13:33.520 --> 13:35.200
Please, just call me back, Becky.

13:46.080 --> 13:47.240
[line ringing]

13:47.320 --> 13:49.560
Pick up the phone, pick up the phone.

13:54.320 --> 13:55.520
Voice mail again.

13:56.240 --> 13:59.440
It's hard to apologize to somebody
when they won't pick up the phone. Huh?

13:59.520 --> 14:00.560
I'm worried, Zoe.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.840
Becky's so excited about the dance,
she would never miss it.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.840
- Unless...
- Something's happened.

14:08.440 --> 14:11.120
Wait a second. Check her blog.
See if she posted anything.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.600
Great idea.

14:12.840 --> 14:13.880
[keypad beeping]

14:13.960 --> 14:16.720
Right, she posted a live video
an hour ago.

14:17.600 --> 14:18.960
<i>I think my trap is working.</i>

14:19.480 --> 14:20.760
<i>Ghost Pony is among us.</i>

14:20.840 --> 14:23.800
- Guess what, it's about Ghost Pony.
- At least we know she's okay.

14:23.880 --> 14:27.080
- [rustling over phone]
- <i>What was that? Something's coming!</i>

14:28.600 --> 14:29.880
We have to go find her.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.400
[Jade] Becky's phone is definitely here,
somewhere.

14:37.480 --> 14:40.000
[Zoe] But what if her phone is here,
but she isn't?

14:40.480 --> 14:42.600
[Jade] What if the Ghost Pony zapped her?

14:42.840 --> 14:45.160
Are you deliberately trying
to freak me out?

14:46.520 --> 14:47.520
[gasps] Bob!

14:47.600 --> 14:48.800
[snorts]

14:49.600 --> 14:50.880
But where's Becky?

14:51.840 --> 14:53.080
- Guys!
- [Zoe] Becky!

14:53.640 --> 14:55.760
I half thought the Ghost Pony caught you.

14:56.080 --> 14:57.960
Why weren't you answering your phone?

14:58.040 --> 15:00.000
I've been staking out the old barn. Look.

15:01.240 --> 15:04.120
I heard something coming,
so I figured it was maybe Ghost Pony.

15:04.200 --> 15:05.640
- So, I snuck out the back.
- Uh-huh.

15:05.680 --> 15:08.000
But it wasn't a horse, it was a person.

15:08.320 --> 15:11.600
They didn't stay long, but they left
the light on, so I thought they'd...

15:11.680 --> 15:12.680
Come back?

15:13.880 --> 15:15.480
- [vehicle approaching]
- [gasps]

15:15.560 --> 15:16.600
[Zoe] Look. Look.

15:20.480 --> 15:23.880
Look, I know that guy.
That's the fake photographer.

15:23.960 --> 15:27.000
<i>Remember, the guy who said he was</i>
<i>from the</i> Pony People <i>magazine?</i>

15:28.160 --> 15:29.840
[Becky] He's wearing one of our hoodies.

15:29.920 --> 15:32.320
- How very dare he.
- Becky, no. Shh.

15:33.120 --> 15:34.280
[Zoe] It all makes sense now.

15:34.360 --> 15:37.080
I saw somebody at the beach
in a Stables hoodie that day.

15:37.720 --> 15:40.280
Sam must have given him one
when he came to the yard.

15:43.120 --> 15:44.240
[Becky] What's he doing?

15:44.320 --> 15:45.520
That's horse feed.

15:47.760 --> 15:50.840
- [cell phone ringing]
- [Zoe] He's gonna chain up a horse.

15:50.920 --> 15:52.200
[Jade] That's horrible.

15:52.440 --> 15:54.520
Yes. Everything's ready at my end.

15:54.600 --> 15:55.760
[Zoe] It's George.

15:56.240 --> 15:57.880
George is the horse thief.

16:31.520 --> 16:33.680
He's definitely going to keep
a horse in there.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.800
- We need to call Derek.
- What if he leaves before Derek gets here?

16:39.240 --> 16:41.760
Do you have that video of Bob
when Becky thought he was singing?

16:42.000 --> 16:43.320
- Yes.
- He was totally singing.

16:44.120 --> 16:47.040
- Something was irritating his nose.
- Which was making him sing.

16:47.120 --> 16:49.200
Guys, horse thief. He's about to get away.

16:49.880 --> 16:52.240
- Here.
- Great.

17:30.080 --> 17:31.280

Is there someone in here?

17:36.960 --> 17:38.640
[girls shouting indistinctly]

17:38.720 --> 17:40.496
- [George] What do you think you're doing?
- [girls] Yes!

17:40.520 --> 17:42.640
- [George] Open this door!
- We did it!

17:46.320 --> 17:47.920
If you'd like to come with me, sir.

17:50.120 --> 17:53.360
- Enjoy jail, George.
- If that's even your real name.

17:54.880 --> 17:58.400
Don't give us evils just because
you got totally owned by Pony Squad.

17:58.640 --> 18:00.800
Well, Becky, you wanted
to catch Ghost Pony,

18:00.880 --> 18:03.520
- and instead you caught a horse thief.
- [chuckling]

18:03.600 --> 18:06.640
I don't know what I was thinking.
You can't catch a ghost with a net.

18:06.720 --> 18:09.200
- It'd go right through it.
- I can help you make a new trap.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.160
I mean, if you need a hand
with ghost catching.

18:12.560 --> 18:13.560
Oh!

18:13.640 --> 18:16.680
Well, guys,
this hug would be really awkward

18:17.040 --> 18:18.320
if you were still mad at me.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.160
Of course we're not mad at you.

18:20.240 --> 18:21.560
[gasps] The dance.

18:21.640 --> 18:24.160
- Come on or we're gonna be late.
- Wait. Do I look okay?

18:25.080 --> 18:27.560
- Uh, yeah. You got a little something...
- Here?

18:27.640 --> 18:29.720
- Here? Is it gone?
- [Zoe] Um...

18:29.800 --> 18:32.280
- [Jade] She was...
- You're close. You're close. You're close.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.800
You know what? I think we look great.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.800

- Come on.

But first, I would like to share
a few words with you.

Now, I know you all enjoy being covered
in mud and horse hair,

you can do to change that.
