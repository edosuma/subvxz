00:02.068 --> 00:05.455
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:06.373 --> 00:07.874
Sammy, got three questions.

00:07.874 --> 00:10.377
One, who's going to fix the ball return

00:10.377 --> 00:11.244
on the pool table?

00:11.244 --> 00:13.463
Okay, I'll check that today.

00:13.463 --> 00:15.665
Check. Two, how much vermouth
do you want next month?

00:15.665 --> 00:17.467
Uh, an extra case.

00:17.467 --> 00:19.219
Check. Three, why, why, why?!

00:19.219 --> 00:20.470
Oh, come on, don't start with me

00:20.470 --> 00:21.971
about the wedding, will you?

00:21.971 --> 00:23.473
Oh, Sammy-- Sam,
it actually looks

00:23.473 --> 00:25.842
like you're going to go through
with this horrible thing.

00:25.842 --> 00:28.812
Why do you want to marry this woman?

00:31.147 --> 00:33.483
I don't know, Carla. It...

00:35.485 --> 00:38.238
It's not easy to explain.

00:38.238 --> 00:40.023
I mean, why did you marry Nick?

00:40.023 --> 00:42.409
Why?! 'Cause I was stupid, that's why.

00:43.660 --> 00:45.328
Well...

00:45.328 --> 00:47.280
actually, there was a little more.

00:49.282 --> 00:50.283
What?

00:50.283 --> 00:52.285
You tell anybody this,
and I'll kill you.

00:52.285 --> 00:53.787
(muttering): No, I won't.

00:53.787 --> 00:55.288
(sighing)

00:55.288 --> 01:00.794
Nick made me feel... all...

01:00.794 --> 01:03.680
(sighing): all squooshy inside.

01:03.680 --> 01:06.516
"Squooshy"?

01:06.516 --> 01:08.384
Squooshy.

01:09.803 --> 01:11.805
Uh, well...

01:12.305 --> 01:13.807
that's how Diane
makes me feel--

01:13.807 --> 01:14.808
all squooshy.

01:14.808 --> 01:16.309
(yelling): Oh, yuck!

01:16.309 --> 01:17.193
Double yuck!

01:17.694 --> 01:18.695
Oh, I'm gonna throw up!

01:18.695 --> 01:20.063
This is so disgusting!

01:20.063 --> 01:21.364
You said it. What do y...?

01:21.364 --> 01:23.366
I married Nick 'cause he knocked me up.

01:23.366 --> 01:24.617
This is sickening!

01:24.617 --> 01:25.401
Ugh!

01:25.401 --> 01:27.403
I only said it 'cause you said it.

01:27.403 --> 01:28.905
What are you do...? I need some air.

01:28.905 --> 01:30.406
Hey, guys, listen to this!

01:30.406 --> 01:31.407
No, don't, please don't...!

01:31.407 --> 01:33.409
Sam says Diane makes
him feel all squooshy!

01:33.409 --> 01:34.911
(crowd taunting)

01:34.911 --> 01:36.162
MAN: Ooh, Sammy!

01:37.464 --> 01:38.965
"Squooshy."

01:38.965 --> 01:40.967
Oh!

01:41.968 --> 01:45.972
(piano plays)

01:45.972 --> 01:47.974
? Sometimes you want to go ?

01:47.974 --> 01:53.480
? Where everybody knows your name ?

01:53.480 --> 01:57.984
? And they're always glad you came ?

01:57.984 --> 02:00.487
? You want to be where you can see ?

02:00.487 --> 02:03.490
? Our troubles are all the same ?

02:03.490 --> 02:07.994
? You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ?

02:24.010 --> 02:26.012
Excuse me, young man.

02:26.012 --> 02:27.514
I'm Dr. Sumner Sloane.

02:27.514 --> 02:30.016
I'm looking for Diane Chambers.

02:30.016 --> 02:31.518
Gee, I hope she's not sick.

02:31.518 --> 02:33.520
No, I'm not a medical doctor.

02:33.520 --> 02:36.523
I'm in the Literature
Department at Boston University

02:36.523 --> 02:38.024
where I occupy a chair.

02:38.024 --> 02:40.026
Huh. Hey, don't worry about it.

02:40.026 --> 02:42.028
That's all I did in school, too.

02:44.397 --> 02:46.232
Hey, that's Sumner Sloane there.

02:46.232 --> 02:48.234
The famous
Sumner Sloane--

02:48.234 --> 02:50.119
the man who jilted Diane?

02:50.119 --> 02:51.905
Yup. He made a bigger doofus out of her

02:51.905 --> 02:52.906
than she made out of you.

02:52.906 --> 02:53.907
No easy trick.

02:53.907 --> 02:55.408
Oh, boy, yeah, that was one

02:55.408 --> 02:57.410
of your major league dumps, too.

02:57.410 --> 02:58.411
Poor little Diane,

02:58.411 --> 03:00.914
left there on our doorstep, you know,

03:00.914 --> 03:03.416
turning to us for, uh,
shelter from life's storm.

03:03.416 --> 03:05.919
Boy, oh, boy, it seems
like a long time ago,

03:05.919 --> 03:07.420
doesn't it, Normie? Yep.

03:07.420 --> 03:09.923
A lot's changed since
that fateful night, eh?

03:09.923 --> 03:10.924
Yeah. As I recall,

03:10.924 --> 03:12.926
you were sitting over
there, drinking a beer,

03:12.926 --> 03:14.928
and I was sitting right
here having a beer,

03:14.928 --> 03:16.429
kind of wishing you'd shut up.

03:16.429 --> 03:18.932
Good memory. Yeah.

03:19.432 --> 03:22.435
(Diane laughing)

03:22.435 --> 03:24.437
Hello, Diane.

03:24.437 --> 03:26.439
Hello, Sumner.

03:26.439 --> 03:28.942
Hello, Sam, old man. Sumner.

03:28.942 --> 03:31.277
I understand
congratulations are in order.

03:31.277 --> 03:33.780
You've heard about our engagement?

03:33.780 --> 03:35.281
Yes. Wonderful news travels fast.

03:35.281 --> 03:36.749
Sam, old man,

03:36.749 --> 03:39.002
I'd like to steal away
your lovely bride-to-be

03:39.002 --> 03:40.286
for a private chat.

03:40.286 --> 03:42.088
With your permission, of course.

03:42.088 --> 03:42.872
You're not going to try

03:42.872 --> 03:44.874
to take her away from
me, are you, Sumner?

03:44.874 --> 03:46.876
It's obvious you've
cast a spell over Diane

03:46.876 --> 03:48.878
that someone with even
my considerable charms

03:48.878 --> 03:50.380
would find difficult to break.

03:50.380 --> 03:53.883
Well, maybe with your charms
and a jug of cheap wine.

03:55.385 --> 03:57.387
Hello, I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.

03:57.387 --> 03:59.389
Perhaps you've heard of me.

03:59.389 --> 04:00.890
Not till this moment.

04:00.890 --> 04:01.891
Well, it just so happens

04:02.392 --> 04:04.394
that I was once engaged to Diane, too.

04:04.394 --> 04:08.898
Ah. Is there anyone in this
bar you haven't been engaged to?

04:08.898 --> 04:10.400
Well,

04:10.400 --> 04:11.901
I believe the floor is now open

04:11.901 --> 04:14.404
to nominations for "pompous
ass of the year" award.

04:17.906 --> 04:20.410
Hey, uh, remember us, uh, Dr. Sloane?

04:20.410 --> 04:21.827
How could I forget?

04:21.827 --> 04:23.329
Barney, Wally, Ed.

04:27.216 --> 04:29.719
When I heard of your
impending marriage to Sam,

04:29.719 --> 04:32.088
I thought perhaps I
had overestimated you.

04:32.088 --> 04:35.008
So, I pored through
everything that you'd written--

04:35.008 --> 04:37.810
letters, poems, short stories.

04:37.810 --> 04:39.012
The pages burned

04:39.012 --> 04:40.980
with your talent, Diane,

04:40.980 --> 04:42.482
and I was singed.

04:42.482 --> 04:44.934
Why are you telling me this?

04:44.934 --> 04:46.853
I was so impressed by one
of your unfinished novels,

04:46.853 --> 04:48.855
I took the liberty of
sending it to a friend

04:48.855 --> 04:50.273
who's an editor at Houghton Mifflin.

04:50.273 --> 04:52.575
You had no right to do that.

04:52.575 --> 04:54.494
While he concurs with me

04:54.494 --> 04:57.497
that it's rough, embryonic and immature,

04:57.497 --> 04:58.998
he loves it...

05:00.416 --> 05:01.918
...and thinks it has

05:01.918 --> 05:03.419
a very good chance of being published.

05:04.871 --> 05:06.873
Published?

05:09.709 --> 05:10.710
I knew it.

05:10.710 --> 05:11.711
I felt it.

05:11.711 --> 05:13.713
I've never been more alive in my life

05:13.713 --> 05:15.214
than when I was writing that.

05:15.214 --> 05:16.716
Which one was it?

05:18.101 --> 05:20.353
Jocasta's Conundrum.

05:20.353 --> 05:21.637
Yes!

05:21.637 --> 05:23.639
(giggling)

05:23.639 --> 05:25.141
I'm going to be a novelist.

05:25.141 --> 05:26.642
I'm going to be a novelist.

05:26.642 --> 05:29.145
Now, this doesn't guarantee publication.

05:29.145 --> 05:30.646
He has other people to convince.

05:30.646 --> 05:33.149
And he'll have to see the finished work.

05:33.149 --> 05:36.536
Actually, I haven't quite finished it.

05:36.536 --> 05:37.403
I haven't written

05:37.870 --> 05:41.374
for... five years.

05:41.374 --> 05:43.376
That's about the same amount of time

05:43.376 --> 05:46.879
you've been interred in
this, uh, tomb of thought.

05:46.879 --> 05:51.884
Oh... roughly.

05:51.884 --> 05:54.887
Well, then it's imperative
you get out of here

05:54.887 --> 05:56.889
and finish this novel immediately.

05:56.889 --> 05:58.391
You can use my cabin in Maine.

05:58.391 --> 06:01.394
It's where I go to do most
of my profound thinking.

06:02.395 --> 06:04.397
You'll love it!

06:04.397 --> 06:06.899
Ted Koppel has a little
place right down the road.

06:09.819 --> 06:11.320
I can't.

06:11.320 --> 06:12.822
I'm going to marry Sam.

06:12.822 --> 06:15.575
Do you realize the implications

06:15.575 --> 06:16.859
of the choice you're making?

06:16.859 --> 06:18.361
There's no choice.

06:18.361 --> 06:21.364
A woman can be married and write, too.

06:21.364 --> 06:22.865
Oh, I get it.

06:22.865 --> 06:25.368
You're going to write
the great American novel

06:25.368 --> 06:28.371
in between driving the
kids to Little League games,

06:28.371 --> 06:30.873
changing a litter box
and teaching Sam pinochle

06:30.873 --> 06:33.876
so you can finally have
the Mundanes over to dinner.

06:37.880 --> 06:39.882
Well, even if I can't
do both, I don't care.

06:39.882 --> 06:41.384
Of course you don't.

06:41.384 --> 06:43.386
Sam's bludgeoned all
the spirit out of you

06:43.386 --> 06:45.388
and dragged you back down to his level.

06:45.388 --> 06:46.856
No one was dragged, Sumner.

06:46.856 --> 06:47.857
Sam and I

06:48.357 --> 06:51.360
walked arm in arm to his level.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.282
I think you'd better leave now.

06:56.282 --> 06:59.285
Yes, I'll leave.

06:59.285 --> 07:00.286
But the time will come

07:00.286 --> 07:02.288
when you'll look back on this moment

07:02.288 --> 07:04.290
and realize you've
made a terrible mistake.

07:04.290 --> 07:06.292
I'm glad I won't be
around to witness that.

07:06.292 --> 07:07.743
So am I.

07:07.743 --> 07:08.661
Touch?.

07:08.661 --> 07:12.665
How appropriate that as
I take my leave of you,

07:12.665 --> 07:15.668
you are holding the eight ball.

07:15.668 --> 07:18.171
Good-bye, Diane.

07:20.673 --> 07:22.175
(ball rolls, then drops)

07:34.020 --> 07:35.855
DIANE: Sam?

07:35.855 --> 07:37.106
Yeah.

07:37.106 --> 07:37.940
Oh, there you are.

07:38.441 --> 07:39.275
Where have you been?

07:39.275 --> 07:41.194
I, uh, was at the dentist.

07:41.194 --> 07:43.696
I, uh, had something caught in my teeth.

07:47.533 --> 07:49.035
What are you up to there?

07:49.035 --> 07:51.454
I've started addressing
our wedding invitations.

07:51.454 --> 07:52.839
So...

07:52.839 --> 07:54.590
what did Sumner have to say?

07:54.590 --> 07:57.376
Well, it seems he has submitted

07:57.376 --> 08:00.379
the manuscript of one of my novels

08:00.379 --> 08:01.881
to an editor

08:01.881 --> 08:04.383
who thinks it might be publishable

08:04.383 --> 08:05.384
with a little work.

08:05.384 --> 08:07.887
Well, that's great, isn't it?

08:07.887 --> 08:09.272
Yeah, it's...

08:09.272 --> 08:11.057
very flattering.

08:11.057 --> 08:13.059
And I'm not easily flattered.

08:13.559 --> 08:15.061
Oh, I know, I know.

08:15.061 --> 08:16.946
That's, uh...

08:16.946 --> 08:19.115
That's one of the most
remarkable things about you.

08:19.115 --> 08:21.817
Thank you, Sam.

08:21.817 --> 08:23.286
Hey, wait a minute.

08:23.286 --> 08:26.289
You know, this... this
could work out perfectly.

08:26.289 --> 08:29.792
Why don't we... why don't
we postpone the wedding?

08:31.794 --> 08:33.663
Postpone it? Yeah, absolutely.

08:33.663 --> 08:36.131
I mean, you-you could go
off and finish your book,

08:36.131 --> 08:38.134
and it'd give me a
chance to do something

08:38.134 --> 08:39.635
I've wanted to do all my life.

08:39.635 --> 08:41.136
What?

08:41.136 --> 08:43.054
What do you mean what?

08:43.054 --> 08:44.924
You want me to name it?

08:46.842 --> 08:48.728
That'd be good.

08:48.728 --> 08:52.148
Well, I, uh, take a trip to the Orient.

08:52.148 --> 08:55.401
Yeah, yeah, I always
wanted to go to the Orient.

08:55.401 --> 08:59.021
You've never said anything
about a trip to the Orient.

08:59.021 --> 09:00.990
Well, not in so many words, but I mean,

09:00.990 --> 09:03.359
you know how much I like
Chinese food. It's...

09:05.161 --> 09:08.531
Sam, I've waited several
years for this marriage,

09:08.531 --> 09:11.534
and I don't want to wait any longer.

09:11.534 --> 09:13.419
I'm starting to get scared.

09:13.419 --> 09:15.171
Oh, no. Something always seems

09:15.171 --> 09:17.456
to screw us up--
usually it's you.

09:18.958 --> 09:21.210
Sometimes it's me.

09:21.210 --> 09:22.378
Let's get married now.

09:22.378 --> 09:24.714
What do you mean "now"?

09:24.714 --> 09:26.599
Now. Tonight.

09:26.599 --> 09:28.467
Tonight?

09:28.467 --> 09:30.469
Yeah.

09:30.469 --> 09:32.471
You know, what's the rush?

09:32.471 --> 09:33.856
I mean, it feels like

09:33.856 --> 09:35.641
you want to do this fast

09:35.641 --> 09:38.027
so that you don't change your mind.

09:38.027 --> 09:41.814
You're the one who seems
to be changing his mind.

09:41.814 --> 09:43.065
No, no, I'm not, no, I'm not.

09:43.065 --> 09:44.984
Well, good, then there's no problem.

09:44.984 --> 09:46.485
Let's marry tonight.

09:46.485 --> 09:48.487
Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't.

09:49.488 --> 09:51.991
We ought to think about this.

09:53.492 --> 09:54.493
All right, fine.

09:54.493 --> 09:56.879
You sit down and think about it.

09:58.080 --> 10:00.383
I'll make us some tea.

10:00.383 --> 10:01.751
If you get stuck, call me.

10:01.751 --> 10:03.803
I'll come in and jiggle your head.

10:11.761 --> 10:13.012
Tea time, dear.

10:16.732 --> 10:19.068
I've had a great life.

10:19.068 --> 10:23.939
My grandson's a 25-game
winner with the... Red Sox.

10:23.939 --> 10:26.275
Got the prettiest wife in town.

10:26.275 --> 10:27.693
And I can still fire off

10:27.693 --> 10:30.613
the old booster rockets now and again.

10:32.999 --> 10:36.335
And don't forget your pinochle's
coming along quite well.

10:36.335 --> 10:39.121
Yes, yes. You know, now
that I got the hang of it,

10:39.121 --> 10:40.506
I kind of like that game.

10:42.541 --> 10:44.343
Who called there a minute ago?

10:44.343 --> 10:47.213
That was your granddaughter, Samantha.

10:47.213 --> 10:49.965
She said to tell her gramps that she has

10:49.965 --> 10:52.435
a new boyfriend.

10:52.435 --> 10:53.936
Uh-oh.

10:53.936 --> 10:54.937
What's he like?

10:54.937 --> 10:57.940
Well, he sounds like a fine young man.

10:57.940 --> 11:00.309
She said he has his doctorate

11:00.309 --> 11:03.729
in laser beam demolecularization.

11:03.729 --> 11:06.198
There's only one thing
that kept me from going

11:06.198 --> 11:07.450
into that myself.

11:07.450 --> 11:10.202
I don't have the brains of a turnip.

11:10.202 --> 11:12.204
(both chuckling)

11:12.204 --> 11:14.206
(coughing)

11:14.206 --> 11:16.575
(knock at door)

11:16.575 --> 11:19.078
I'll get it.

11:22.081 --> 11:24.583
Maybe you better do it.

11:25.584 --> 11:29.004
I'd rather watch you walk anyway.

11:29.004 --> 11:31.006
You know, it's absolutely amazing

11:31.006 --> 11:32.758
how you've held onto your figure.

11:32.758 --> 11:35.978
Well, it's amazing how
you've held onto it, too.

11:37.813 --> 11:41.567
Oh, Clifford. (laughs)

11:41.567 --> 11:44.070
Er... you hit the jackpot there, Diane.

11:44.070 --> 11:45.071
Oh, thanks so much.

11:45.071 --> 11:48.074
Would you like to come
in and have a cup of tea?

11:48.074 --> 11:50.076
Oh, don't mind if I do.

11:50.076 --> 11:51.577
Good.

11:54.330 --> 11:56.499
When are you going to retire, Cliff?

11:56.499 --> 11:57.750
"Retire"?

11:57.750 --> 12:00.619
(chuckling): Hells bells, Sammy.

12:00.619 --> 12:04.924
Being a mailman's still
the surest way I know

12:04.924 --> 12:07.927
of, uh, meeting the, uh...

12:10.429 --> 12:11.380
Women. Women.

12:11.380 --> 12:14.216
(coughing)

12:14.216 --> 12:16.218
(knock at door)

12:16.218 --> 12:18.604
I'll get it.

12:18.604 --> 12:20.439
No, maybe not.

12:22.391 --> 12:23.809
Let me.

12:23.809 --> 12:28.314
We seem to be very popular today.

12:29.315 --> 12:31.700
Evening, everybody.

12:31.700 --> 12:32.535
Norm! Norm!

12:32.535 --> 12:34.537
Norman.

12:34.537 --> 12:35.404
What's up, Norm?

12:35.404 --> 12:37.706
Me, about 30 times a night.

12:40.126 --> 12:41.627
Norman,

12:41.627 --> 12:43.996
shall I get you a cup so
you can join us in some tea?

12:43.996 --> 12:45.798
No, no, thanks, Diane.

12:45.798 --> 12:46.799
I'm just here

12:46.799 --> 12:47.716
to pick up Cliffie.

12:47.716 --> 12:50.219
We're going to go on over to Woody's bar

12:50.219 --> 12:52.221
and have a few beers.

12:52.221 --> 12:53.589
Well, tell Woody we say hi.

12:53.589 --> 12:55.090
Mm-hmm, yeah.

12:55.090 --> 12:56.342
How's he doing with the bar?

12:56.342 --> 12:57.676
Well, Sammy, he's, uh, turned it

12:58.177 --> 12:59.678
into a real family enterprise, you know.

12:59.678 --> 13:01.397
Hmm. He's, uh...

13:01.397 --> 13:04.183
He and, uh, his kid are...
are working behind the bar,

13:04.183 --> 13:05.184
and he's got his-his wife

13:05.184 --> 13:07.186
and his daughter
actually waiting tables.

13:07.186 --> 13:08.571
And in the evening,

13:08.571 --> 13:09.855
they, uh, apparently

13:09.855 --> 13:11.190
take off all their shoes and socks

13:11.190 --> 13:13.192
and add up the receipts.

13:13.192 --> 13:16.195
(all laughing) (Sam coughing)

13:16.195 --> 13:18.197
Oh...

13:18.197 --> 13:19.615
Yep.

13:19.615 --> 13:21.617
We're out of here. Cliffie?

13:21.617 --> 13:23.619
Women.

13:23.619 --> 13:26.121
No, we're out of here.

13:26.121 --> 13:30.626
Er... eh... really, eh,
nice seeing you two again.

13:30.626 --> 13:33.879
Eh, Diane, you get, uh,
better looking every year.

13:33.879 --> 13:35.714
Why, thank you, Clifford.

13:35.714 --> 13:40.219
Yeah, wish I could say
the same thing about Vera.

13:40.219 --> 13:42.221
Oh, Norman, didn't you
tell us that Vera still has

13:42.221 --> 13:43.606
the figure of a young girl?

13:43.606 --> 13:45.724
That's right; it's tattooed on her back.

13:46.976 --> 13:49.478
(coughing)

13:49.478 --> 13:52.481
Good one. Good one.

13:52.481 --> 13:55.484
You know, Sam, Mm-hmm?

13:55.484 --> 13:58.487
we are blessed.

13:58.487 --> 14:02.491
With wonderful friends
and a wonderful family.

14:02.491 --> 14:05.494
It certainly has been a good life.

14:08.998 --> 14:11.000
Do you have any regrets?

14:13.002 --> 14:14.003
None.

14:15.421 --> 14:16.422
Now, what about that book

14:16.422 --> 14:18.424
you were going to write a long time ago?

14:18.424 --> 14:19.925
Now, don't you ever wish

14:19.925 --> 14:21.927
that you had done that
instead of marrying me?

14:21.927 --> 14:25.931
Oh,... that was years
and years ago, Sam.

14:25.931 --> 14:28.434
I know that, but don't
you have any regrets?

14:29.935 --> 14:32.438
Sam Malone...

14:32.438 --> 14:35.941
I wouldn't trade one
minute of my life with you

14:35.941 --> 14:38.944
for a Nobel Prize in Literature.

14:38.944 --> 14:41.413
(phone ringing)

14:42.781 --> 14:45.200
I'll get it.

14:45.200 --> 14:48.203
Oh.

14:48.203 --> 14:51.206
Hello.

14:51.206 --> 14:53.709
I don't know why, Carla--
because I love her!

14:53.709 --> 14:57.212
Now, can we just leave
this alone, please?!

15:00.599 --> 15:02.685
DIANE: Teatime, Sam.

15:06.522 --> 15:08.524
So, what's your answer?

15:08.524 --> 15:10.526
"Yes" or "I need more
time to think about it"?

15:10.526 --> 15:12.778
Hmm.

15:12.778 --> 15:14.613
Okay.

15:14.613 --> 15:15.614
You mean it?

15:16.115 --> 15:18.117
Yeah. Oh, Sam!

15:18.117 --> 15:19.118
You won't regret it.

15:19.618 --> 15:20.619
Well, I just hope you don't.

15:20.619 --> 15:22.121
Oh, I never shall.

15:22.621 --> 15:25.491
Thank you. Mm.

15:25.491 --> 15:26.325
Come on, let's do it.

15:26.325 --> 15:28.210
Let's go get a justice of the peace.

15:28.210 --> 15:30.713
Better yet, let's wed at Cheers.

15:30.713 --> 15:31.497
The bar?

15:31.497 --> 15:33.465
It's ideal.

15:33.465 --> 15:34.967
Right there in front
of our dearest friends

15:34.967 --> 15:36.468
who've been witness to our love,

15:36.468 --> 15:38.921
seeing the good times and the bad times,

15:38.921 --> 15:40.306
shared our joys and sorrows.

15:40.306 --> 15:41.307
How perfect.

15:41.807 --> 15:44.310
Those dear souls who will share

15:44.310 --> 15:46.312
our moment of ultimate joy.

15:46.312 --> 15:48.180
Better still, why don't we
have 'em over right here?

15:48.180 --> 15:49.431
We'll do it right here.

15:49.431 --> 15:52.101
Oh, I don't want those
people in my house.

16:00.259 --> 16:02.428
All right, I got 20 bucks
says they won't do it.

16:02.428 --> 16:04.263
All right, well, I got, eh, 30 here

16:04.263 --> 16:07.132
says they, uh, tie the
knot-ski tonight-ski.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.600
I'd like a piece of that,
Cliff, because you see,

16:09.101 --> 16:10.102
I'm convinced that the words "I do"

16:10.602 --> 16:11.854
are not in the woman's vocabulary.

16:12.688 --> 16:15.057
Eh, all right, let's see
how much you got there.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.859
Come on, put your money
where your mouth is.

16:16.859 --> 16:18.360
Hey, everybody!

16:18.360 --> 16:21.363
ALL: Hey!

16:21.363 --> 16:23.365
Wish me luck.

16:23.365 --> 16:25.367
(guests cheering)

16:25.367 --> 16:29.238
Sammy, uh, let me just give
you a little piece of advice

16:29.238 --> 16:32.741
I wish somebody would've given me once.

16:32.741 --> 16:34.243
Run, Sammy, run.

16:34.243 --> 16:36.128
Run like the wind.

16:36.128 --> 16:39.415
Disappear into the night. Go, Sam, go!

16:40.749 --> 16:43.218
(piano playing "Wedding March")

16:47.089 --> 16:49.475
(sobbing)

16:55.981 --> 16:57.850
(music stops)

16:57.850 --> 17:00.769
(whimpering)

17:00.769 --> 17:02.771
I understand that this has been

17:02.771 --> 17:04.156
a long time in coming.

17:05.574 --> 17:09.278
So without further delay, uh,
we'll get to the matter at hand.

17:09.278 --> 17:11.113
You, Sam, and you, Diane,

17:11.113 --> 17:13.415
have complied with the general laws

17:13.415 --> 17:15.416
of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,

17:15.416 --> 17:18.170
and there are no apparent
impediments to this marriage.

17:18.170 --> 17:20.172
(wailing)

17:23.175 --> 17:26.545
Therefore, do you, Sam Malone,

17:26.545 --> 17:29.298
take this woman, Diane Chambers,
to be your lawfully wedded wife

17:29.798 --> 17:31.800
till death do you part?

17:31.800 --> 17:33.052
I do.

17:33.052 --> 17:36.138
(shrieking)

17:36.138 --> 17:38.857
(phone rings)

17:38.857 --> 17:40.726
Cheers.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.227
Oh, just a second.

17:42.227 --> 17:43.228
Miss Chambers, it's for you.

17:45.114 --> 17:48.067
Woody, I'm kind of busy.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.952
Oh.

17:49.952 --> 17:51.453
Uh, listen, she's getting married.

17:51.453 --> 17:53.956
Can I take a message?

17:53.956 --> 17:55.824
You're kidding.

17:55.824 --> 17:57.659
Oh, that's...

17:58.160 --> 18:01.163
Yeah, that's great. That's unbelievable.

18:01.163 --> 18:02.664
You're welcome.

18:02.664 --> 18:04.917
(laughs)

18:04.917 --> 18:07.753
Go ahead.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.590
No, no, don't go ahead.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.258
Woody, what is it?

18:13.258 --> 18:15.394
They're going to publish
Miss Chambers' book.

18:15.394 --> 18:18.680
They're giving her a
big advance to finish it.

18:18.680 --> 18:21.934
Um, to, uh, continue...

18:24.736 --> 18:26.605
Diane Chambers,

18:26.605 --> 18:28.857
do you take this man, Samuel Malone,

18:28.857 --> 18:30.859
to be your lawfully wedded husband

18:30.859 --> 18:32.528
till death do you part?

18:33.328 --> 18:34.830
What?

18:34.830 --> 18:36.331
Oh, yes, of course.

18:36.331 --> 18:38.834
Why wouldn't I?

18:38.834 --> 18:40.335
Well, then, by the powers
vested in me by the governor

18:40.335 --> 18:42.204
of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,

18:42.204 --> 18:44.206
I now pronounce you
man... No, you don't.

18:45.874 --> 18:48.961
I want to change my answer.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.547
What did he say?

18:51.547 --> 18:52.714
Sam...

18:58.687 --> 19:02.474
Look, you got to do this book.

19:02.474 --> 19:03.442
You have to.

19:03.442 --> 19:05.444
I don't care about the book.

19:05.444 --> 19:07.613
I care about you.

19:07.613 --> 19:10.782
Go ahead, from the beginning, please.

19:10.782 --> 19:12.117
This is inhuman.

19:14.069 --> 19:15.571
You, Sam, and you, Diane,

19:15.571 --> 19:19.575
have complied with the
general regulations and the...

19:19.575 --> 19:21.210
laws of the Commonwealth...

19:21.210 --> 19:22.995
No, no,
w-w-w-wait-wait.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.496
Look, I-I-I don't
want to be married

19:24.496 --> 19:26.965
to a woman who's going to
be always asking, "What if"?

19:30.135 --> 19:31.920
I'll tell you what.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.922
Y-Y-You're
bad at ballet.

19:33.922 --> 19:34.923
You're terrible at acting.

19:34.923 --> 19:36.925
You don't... you can't
draw worth a lick.

19:36.925 --> 19:38.393
You're bad at-at poetry,

19:38.393 --> 19:40.395
photography, cinema and omelets.

19:40.395 --> 19:41.897
I mean, they're going to have to start

19:41.897 --> 19:44.399
inventing things for you to be bad at.

19:44.399 --> 19:47.402
Make your point, Sam.

19:47.903 --> 19:49.404
You're-you're good at writing.

19:49.404 --> 19:51.406
I mean, I think we
finally found something

19:51.406 --> 19:52.908
you don't stink at.

19:52.908 --> 19:54.910
But, Sam, I-I...

19:54.910 --> 19:58.914
Look, look, this is important for you.

19:58.914 --> 20:01.917
I mean, I-I-I had
my day in the sun.

20:01.917 --> 20:03.285
I-I may not have been

20:03.285 --> 20:05.170
the greatest relief
pitcher in the world...

20:05.170 --> 20:05.954
Yeah, you were, Sammy.

20:05.954 --> 20:07.873
Thank you. The point is...

20:07.873 --> 20:10.375
the point is

20:10.375 --> 20:12.711
I took a shot.

20:12.711 --> 20:17.049
You've got to take your shot.

20:20.852 --> 20:23.855
Well...

20:23.855 --> 20:25.724
we've always gone with our feelings.

20:25.724 --> 20:26.858
Yeah.

20:28.610 --> 20:30.612
Are these your feelings?

20:31.613 --> 20:33.115
Yes, they are.

20:34.950 --> 20:39.321
I only want to do what's best for us.

20:39.321 --> 20:42.824
So...

20:42.824 --> 20:46.245
do you agree that we
shouldn't get married?

20:53.085 --> 20:54.836
I do.

20:54.836 --> 20:56.004
(squeals)

20:56.838 --> 20:59.341
Thank you, thank you.

20:59.341 --> 21:02.344
(excited clamoring)

21:05.847 --> 21:08.850
(Carla sobbing)

21:12.521 --> 21:14.406
DIANE: Well, Maine awaits.

21:22.748 --> 21:24.249
See you in six months.

21:24.249 --> 21:25.250
Right.

21:25.250 --> 21:27.252
Right.

21:37.212 --> 21:40.716
Next time, let's have our
wedding somewhere else.

21:40.716 --> 21:43.719
Anything you say.

21:45.721 --> 21:48.607
(sighs)

21:52.861 --> 21:54.363
(sighs)

21:54.363 --> 21:55.864
Hey.

21:55.864 --> 21:57.783
Have a good life.

21:59.785 --> 22:01.787
"Have a good life"?

22:02.237 --> 22:03.071
What?

22:03.071 --> 22:04.489
Well, that's something you say

22:04.489 --> 22:05.991
when something's over.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.912
Sam, I'm going away for six months.

22:10.912 --> 22:12.414
That's all.

22:12.414 --> 22:15.334
So no more of this
"have a good life" stuff.

22:15.334 --> 22:18.086
You never know. You-you
could die. I could die.

22:18.086 --> 22:19.388
The world could end.

22:19.888 --> 22:21.890
One of us could bump our heads and, uh,

22:21.890 --> 22:23.392
wander the streets

22:23.392 --> 22:26.395
for the rest of our life with amnesia.

22:27.396 --> 22:29.398
Or maybe one of us will decide

22:29.398 --> 22:30.899
they want something else.

22:32.818 --> 22:35.237
None of those things will happen.

22:36.605 --> 22:39.024
I'll be back here.

22:39.024 --> 22:40.859
I will.

22:40.859 --> 22:43.779
I'll see you in six months.

22:43.779 --> 22:46.198
Okay?

22:46.198 --> 22:47.199
Okay.

22:47.199 --> 22:50.202
Okay. That's better.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.768
Have a good life.

23:06.768 --> 23:09.604
(piano plays gentle melody)

23:39.551 --> 23:42.053
? ?

23:43.305 --> 23:49.729
