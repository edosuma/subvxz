00:03.800 --> 00:07.400
<i>[Lorne] Hey, uh, who wants some mu shu?</i>
<i>I got beaucoup mu shu here.</i>

00:07.400 --> 00:10.200
<i>[Fred]</i>
<i>I'll take some. Thanks.</i>

00:10.200 --> 00:12.600
<i>Angel, this little picnic</i>
<i>was such a good idea.</i>

00:12.600 --> 00:14.600
<i>[Gunn] Yeah, man.</i>
<i>Why haven't we done this before?</i>

00:14.600 --> 00:16.900
[Angel] Oh, you know,
you've all been working so hard.

00:16.900 --> 00:19.400
- [Wesley] Has anyone seen the plum sauce?
- [Device Whirring]

00:19.400 --> 00:23.200
We're clean. Nobody's listening.

00:23.200 --> 00:26.600
- You were late.
- I thought I was being followed.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.800
<i>[Gunn] I get that we have to be careful,</i>
<i>but it feels weird...</i>

00:28.800 --> 00:30.800
hiding from the company
we're supposed to be running.

00:30.800 --> 00:32.700
<i>We're not hiding.</i>
<i>We're being safe.</i>

00:32.700 --> 00:34.900
There are factions at Wolfram and Hart,
people who want to see us destroyed.

00:34.900 --> 00:39.700
But still, it's not like everyone there is evil.
I mean, we work with these people.

00:39.700 --> 00:42.600
Some of them I see more than
I see you guys, at least lately anyway.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.000
And you think you can trust him?

00:45.000 --> 00:49.400
- Them.
- What?

00:49.400 --> 00:52.700
These people. The ones you're spending
so much time with lately.

00:54.300 --> 00:55.900
Knox, for example.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.600
Um, we're, you know...
[Nervous Laugh]

01:00.600 --> 01:03.700
Friendly, but he's under me.

01:03.700 --> 01:07.400
Or, I'm on top of him... professionally.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.300
All I'm saying is he's not evil.

01:10.300 --> 01:13.000
I think we're all agreed that
the senior partners are.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.700
<i>They put us in charge for a reason.</i>
<i>What we need to know is... Why?</i>

01:17.700 --> 01:19.700
Only been there a month.

01:19.700 --> 01:23.500
Turns out running a company doesn't leave
a lot of time for, you know, covert ops.

01:23.800 --> 01:28.100
<i>Yeah, I'm up to my horns schmoozing starlets</i>
<i>and boozing hipsters, Angel.</i>

01:28.100 --> 01:30.700
What about Gunn?

01:30.700 --> 01:34.600
- What about Gunn?
- It's, well...

01:34.800 --> 01:39.600
what they put in your head and all that
law knowledge and whatever.

01:40.900 --> 01:44.300
Maybe you know something
more than the rest of us.

01:44.300 --> 01:47.900
- The alteration to your mental capacity...
- My capacity's the same.

01:47.900 --> 01:51.400
The good doctor just revved up some idling
brain cells, set 'em in motion.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.800
<i>It's a legitimate concern.</i>
<i>You gave them access to...</i>

01:53.800 --> 01:58.100
I made a deal. We all did. Seems like I'm
the only one who's willing to accept that.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.300
Everybody here got something
out of this.

02:01.300 --> 02:03.700
Fear, mistrust, a great motor pool.

02:03.700 --> 02:06.600
I got the Nancy Sinatra
collection. Original 45s.

02:06.600 --> 02:10.100
I did get a rather nice pen.

02:10.100 --> 02:15.600
Sterling. Has my name on it,
which is not the point at all.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.800
No, the point is what?
That I'm some spy for the senior partners?

02:17.800 --> 02:20.200
- Nobody's saying that.
- Just thinking it.

02:20.200 --> 02:24.700
- No. Charles...
<i>- The point is that the senior</i>
<i>partners have a plan for us.</i>

02:24.700 --> 02:28.200
- And if we're not prepared...
- Angel, it's not like we don't wanna be ready.

02:28.200 --> 02:33.200
We just have, you know, plates.
Big, heaping full plates.

02:33.200 --> 02:36.300
Between running our departments,
handling clients, dealing with Spike...

02:36.300 --> 02:40.300
Spike is a distraction. As soon as he's released
from his ties from Wolfram and Hart...

02:40.400 --> 02:43.400
- That could take years.
- Using the amulet to destroy the Hellmouth...

02:43.400 --> 02:47.000
- it turned Spike into...
- A spook?

02:47.000 --> 02:49.500
Well, he's more than a ghost.

02:49.500 --> 02:52.300
<i>He's something unique.</i>

02:52.300 --> 02:55.000
<i>- [Wesley] Regardless, whatever binds him...</i>
- Can I borrow your pen?

02:56.500 --> 02:58.400
Sure.

- Damn it.

04:50.300 --> 04:53.200
She was bitten.
I smelled her blood on him.

04:53.200 --> 04:57.100
Tonight's the second night of the full moon...
two more nights for her to go all dog-girl.

04:57.100 --> 05:00.100
- Twelve hours till moonrise and then...
if she hurts anyone...
- She won't. We'll find her.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.000
We better. She won't even know
what's happening to her.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.100
She'll figure it out soon enough.
McManus did. The guy you...

05:04.100 --> 05:06.000
Killed.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.600
I pulled his credit card records,
cross-checked them with police reports.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.800
He left his wife and kids
a couple years ago.

05:11.800 --> 05:14.400
Kept moving, staying in the middle
of nowhere most of the time.

05:14.400 --> 05:17.100
First year or so, a few mangled bodies
showed up here and there.

05:17.100 --> 05:20.400
But the last six months,
guy was leaving corpses like bread crumbs.

05:20.400 --> 05:23.200
Probably tried to control 'em
for a while, then just gave up.

05:23.200 --> 05:26.600
Thought he had to fight it alone and ended up
with nothing worth fighting for.

05:26.600 --> 05:29.500
But this girl, she's not alone.
She's got us.

05:39.200 --> 05:42.600
- Well, aren't we the busy little beaver.
- Hi, Spike.

05:42.600 --> 05:46.100
I, uh, don't suppose all this bugaboo's
about yours ghostly.

05:46.100 --> 05:49.100
- What? No, not you. It's...
<i>- Werewolf girl.</i>

05:49.100 --> 05:52.800
Right. Heard about that.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.400
Bloody shame about
the poor little miss. But...

05:55.400 --> 05:58.400
Spike, I'm sorry, but I'm kind of busy
right now with the situation.

05:58.400 --> 06:02.700
Hey. I'm a situation, remember?
I'm a bloody phantom.

06:02.700 --> 06:06.100
And you and your serious-girl spectacles were
gonna help me with my bloody little problem.

06:06.100 --> 06:10.600
I know and I bloody will.
I had some ideas.

06:10.600 --> 06:13.200
- Really? What? What ideas?
- They're gonna have to wait till...

06:13.200 --> 06:16.400
Later? There may not be a later, love.
It's getting worse.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.100
Worse? You mean, you're...

06:21.100 --> 06:23.100
Am I winking out of existence? Yeah.

06:23.100 --> 06:26.900
And I'm not talking about quick pops to
the netherworld. They're lasting longer now.

06:26.900 --> 06:30.300
- How long?
- Feels like forever.

06:31.700 --> 06:36.000
Look, something's trying to
hold on to me on the other side.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.600
If you don't do something soon,
one of these times...

06:39.600 --> 06:41.900
I may not come back.

06:41.900 --> 06:44.600
- Wesley might be able to...
- No.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.900
- He-He knows more about the mystical...
- I can't.

06:50.300 --> 06:52.800
We got a history, him and me.

06:52.800 --> 06:55.600
What?

06:55.600 --> 06:58.700
It was a long time ago.

06:58.700 --> 07:02.500
He was a young Watcher, fresh out of
the academy, when we crossed paths.

07:05.300 --> 07:08.400
It was a, what you call, battle of wills.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.300
Blood was spilled.
Vendettas were sworn. It was a whole...

07:14.300 --> 07:16.100
My God.

07:16.100 --> 07:20.100
- You're so full of crap.
- Yeah, okay.

07:20.100 --> 07:23.700
Truth is, I just don't want anyone else
knowing about my condition, right?

07:23.700 --> 07:27.000
- Last thing I need is this getting back to Angel.
- I appreciate your condition...

07:27.000 --> 07:30.800
but right now we have a more pressing
priority, like finding and helping this girl.

07:31.100 --> 07:33.900
And me, I'm just left
to fade into nothingness.

07:33.900 --> 07:36.400
There's no need to be dramatic.

07:36.400 --> 07:41.800
<i>Look, just try not to disappear,</i>
<i>and we'll figure it out eventually.</i>

07:41.800 --> 07:45.700
This place,
we have access to everything.

07:47.700 --> 07:50.600
We're useless. Is that what you're trying to
tell me? All these resources...

07:50.600 --> 07:52.800
- We're doing everything we can.
- Two years of history on the dead guy...

07:52.800 --> 07:54.900
and we can't get one lead
on a living, breathing girl.

07:54.900 --> 07:57.300
Fingerprints. Have his, don't have hers.

07:57.300 --> 08:00.100
There must be something
at the attack scene.

08:00.100 --> 08:02.700
So far, not even an earring.

08:02.700 --> 08:05.800
<i>[Spike] Bloody shame,</i>
<i>letting the girl run offlike that.</i>

08:05.800 --> 08:08.800
Somebody's slipping.

08:08.800 --> 08:11.200
I want people on the street
with this in 15 minutes.

08:11.200 --> 08:14.300
You find anybody who's seen her,
you let me know.

08:14.300 --> 08:17.700
<i>- What about tire prints?</i>
- I'm working on it. It takes time, Angel.

08:17.700 --> 08:20.300
Psychics are working on
traces of the girl's blood.

08:20.300 --> 08:23.800
They pick up images, imprints.

08:23.800 --> 08:26.600
Must be her bedroom. Can they
make it clearer? Maybe they could...

08:26.600 --> 08:29.300
- It's not like a photograph.
<i>- [Camera Shutter Clicking]</i>

08:30.500 --> 08:32.400
Pretty rare breed you've got here.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.799
<i>[Wesley]</i>
<i>Dr. Royce is a cryptozoologist on my staff.</i>

08:34.799 --> 08:38.100
<i>I brought him in to tell us what we'll be</i>
<i>dealing with when we find the girl.</i>

08:38.100 --> 08:43.100
<i>Lycanthropus exterus.</i> Undocumented
in North America... till now, obviously.

08:43.100 --> 08:45.400
How is it different from
a standard werewolf?

08:45.400 --> 08:49.400
Biped, for one thing. Walks upright.
Canines are a bit longer than normal.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.400
- Arm span is...
- I don't care about that.

08:51.400 --> 08:54.600
- All I care about is the girl.
<i>- That's rough.</i>

08:54.600 --> 08:57.900
'Cause here on out,
she's in the kill or be killed club.

08:57.900 --> 08:59.600
Here on out,
she's under my protection.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.700
If you find her before she turns.

09:01.700 --> 09:07.400
<i>Catch her after she goes all growly,</i>
<i>won't be easy taking her out.</i>

09:07.400 --> 09:09.700
I had a wee spat with
a werewolf myself once.

09:09.700 --> 09:13.500
Fought for over an hour.
Brutal. Vicious. Almost lost my...

09:13.800 --> 09:15.800
Angel killed him with a pen.

09:22.200 --> 09:25.700
[Grunting Softly]

<i>[Child Laughing]</i>

09:57.500 --> 09:59.500
[Erratic Breathing]

10:01.500 --> 10:05.300
<i>- Careful with the knife.</i>
- It's not even sharp.

10:05.300 --> 10:09.300
It's sharp enough.
Hey, look who's up.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.800
- How long was I out for?
- All day.

10:11.800 --> 10:14.200
I figured you must be sick.

10:14.200 --> 10:17.600
Zack called. He said he missed you
in Life Drawing.

10:17.600 --> 10:20.800
- That's nice.
- [Loud Buzzing]

10:22.000 --> 10:25.300

10:40.100 --> 10:43.100
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

10:43.100 --> 10:45.400
No. L...

10:45.400 --> 10:48.000
I must have tripped on my run.

10:50.500 --> 10:53.700
- Don't overcook the meat.
<i>- Ooh, can I flip?</i>

10:53.700 --> 10:55.700
Ask Auntie Nina to help.

11:00.400 --> 11:03.300
<i>Hey, are you sure you're up for</i>
<i>watching Amanda tonight?</i>

11:04.700 --> 11:07.300
<i>I could try to change shifts.</i>

Those fine lines?
Bad for the car, good for us.

11:26.400 --> 11:29.000
Apparently, they mean
old tires, at least five years.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
Thank you. Nice sketch. Somebody saw
your girl last night. East Hollywood.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.500
All right, so we're looking for
a midsize sedan, at least five years old...

11:34.500 --> 11:36.800

- Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.400
- Traffic cameras. We networked?
- Yep.

11:52.400 --> 11:55.600
I'm looking at the cameras.
You get set to run with it if I find a match.

11:55.600 --> 11:59.900
Course, I might leak the info to
the senior partners, 'cause we're tight.

11:59.900 --> 12:02.700
- Just do it.
- Is the van ready?

12:02.700 --> 12:07.500
- Yep, I triple-checked.
<i>- Good. 'Cause we got less than an hour.</i>

12:07.500 --> 12:12.900
Lot of fuss over one girl. Other things to do
around here. Important things.

15:53.700 --> 15:56.500
Oh...
[Sniffles]

15:56.500 --> 16:00.500
Well, great. That's...

16:00.500 --> 16:03.200
Get off me! Let go of me!

16:03.200 --> 16:06.200
- Help me, somebody!
- What I'm trying to do, Nina, is help you.

16:06.200 --> 16:11.100
Said the psycho rapist.
How do you know my name?

16:11.100 --> 16:14.900
- What do you want with me?
- Just want you to see something.

16:19.100 --> 16:23.000
I don't... What am I
supposed to be looking...

16:26.600 --> 16:29.700
- God, what is that?
- You don't remember?

16:29.700 --> 16:33.200
- Remember?
- Two nights ago.

16:33.200 --> 16:37.100
You were attacked in the woods.
You were jogging.

16:37.400 --> 16:42.500
Jogging. Wait, yeah.
I remember that l...

16:47.500 --> 16:52.200
That... thing attacked me.

16:52.200 --> 16:54.100
Not exactly.

16:56.200 --> 17:00.000
<i>I was in the area. I heard screams, but</i>
<i>by the time I got there...</i>

17:00.000 --> 17:03.900
That was you. Yeah. I remember.
You-You saved me.

17:03.900 --> 17:06.200
I was too late.

17:22.900 --> 17:26.000
Oh, my God.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.200
It was a werewolf, Nina...

17:29.400 --> 17:31.300
and you were bitten.

17:33.200 --> 17:37.900
No. This is insane.

17:37.900 --> 17:42.300
The bite already started a process.
You may have already started to feel the effects.

17:42.300 --> 17:46.200
Distorted vision. Heightened senses.

17:46.200 --> 17:50.200
Blood. Jill, my sister,
she was cooking meat.

17:50.400 --> 17:55.500
<i>Oh, my God. L-I smelled</i>
<i>the blood. It was making me...</i>

17:57.200 --> 17:59.300
Oh, God. Amanda. My niece.

17:59.300 --> 18:01.500
- She's okay and so is your sister.
- No, you don't get it.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.400
- Nina, it's okay.
- No, it's not.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.600
<i>- You didn't...</i>
- I wanted to rip her throat out.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
It wasn't you.
It was that thing inside.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.800
- Oh, like there's a difference?
<i>- There is. A big one.</i>

18:16.800 --> 18:19.600
<i>- I know this is a lot...</i>
- Don't tell me what you know.

18:19.600 --> 18:23.400
You didn't wake up
and find out you're a... monster.

18:23.700 --> 18:26.900
You don't <i>know</i> anything.

18:26.900 --> 18:29.800
L-I'm not a werewolf... like you.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.700
But-But, I know what it's like.

18:34.800 --> 18:37.300
I'm a monster too.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.500
So, what, you're like a Frankenstein?

18:42.500 --> 18:45.000
What? No.

18:48.800 --> 18:51.000
Um, I'm-I'm a vampire.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.400
- Vampire.
- But I have a soul.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.300
I'm not evil, and neither are you.

18:57.300 --> 19:00.000
- But vampires kill people and they...
<i>- Can control themselves...</i>

19:00.000 --> 19:02.300
if they want to.

19:02.300 --> 19:04.900
I do it every day and so can you.

19:11.100 --> 19:13.500
I'll help.

19:13.500 --> 19:17.200
Can you... cure me?

19:18.300 --> 19:22.100
No. But I can keep you safe.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.800
How is she doing?

19:28.800 --> 19:32.100
Oh, agreed to stay in the holding cell tonight,
but she's pretty scared.

19:32.100 --> 19:34.800
So, what do we do now?

19:34.800 --> 19:38.000
<i>[Spike] We wait for the show.</i>
<i>Should be a good one.</i>

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
Everyone on pins and needles, dreading
the moonrise. Then pop goes the werewolf.

19:42.100 --> 19:45.500
I can't stop what's gonna happen,
but I can keep her from getting hurt.

19:45.500 --> 19:48.100
These first few transformations
are the worst.

19:48.100 --> 19:51.200
The werewolf s strength combined with...

19:51.200 --> 19:54.000
the disorientation and fear.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
You mean she could hurt herself?

19:56.000 --> 19:59.400
Oh, I've seen them bang their heads
against walls, claw at their own skin.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.600
We'll just have to tranq her,
let her sleep through it.

20:01.600 --> 20:05.900
Well, that could work for tonight,
but over the long haul, a bad idea.

20:05.900 --> 20:08.500
Well, there has to be something.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.000
They like familiar scents, images.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.900
Maybe if you took her home let her get a
few things, uh, could have a calming effect.

20:14.900 --> 20:17.800
Fetching a blankie's not going to
make a bloody bit of difference.

20:17.800 --> 20:21.300
- Spike, really not helping.
- I'm just saying... the girl's a killer.

20:21.300 --> 20:24.900
Maybe not tonight, or tomorrow,
but she will get out of that cage.

20:24.900 --> 20:27.900
- Not if she doesn't want to.
- Oh, she'll want to.

20:27.900 --> 20:30.400
- It's unfortunate, but...
<i>- And when it's not that time of month?</i>

20:30.400 --> 20:33.400
She'll be wracked by the guilties.
What with a soul and all.

20:33.400 --> 20:37.400
- Didn't seem to bother you.
- Oh, it's been nothing but a pain in my...

20:37.400 --> 20:40.700
Finally. I'll take Nina by her house.

20:40.700 --> 20:44.200
Angel, it's the middle of the day,
unless you plan on waiting in the car.

20:44.200 --> 20:47.100
Take security, in case
she changes her mind.

20:54.500 --> 20:58.500
So, the entourage. All this for me?

20:58.500 --> 21:03.400
Um, no... Well, yeah, kind of.

21:03.400 --> 21:06.200
I mean, it's just in case you, you know.

21:06.200 --> 21:09.000
- Run away?
- It's-It's not like you're a prisoner.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.400
You're totally not.
It's just... [Exhales]

21:12.400 --> 21:14.700
Really important that
you stay with us tonight.

21:17.700 --> 21:20.600
This is just so... [Scoffs]

21:20.600 --> 21:25.000
I should be in ceramics class right now.
We're learning raku.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.500
Seems like somebody else's life.

21:29.500 --> 21:34.200
Nina, it's just three nights a month,
not even days.

21:34.200 --> 21:37.400
Your life doesn't have to change... much.

21:37.400 --> 21:40.300
How would you... You're not
a monster too, are you?

21:40.300 --> 21:43.600
Nope. Standard issue science nerd.

21:43.600 --> 21:47.600
I did spend five years in a
demon dimension... till Angel saved me.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.900
I guess he saves a lot of girls, huh?

21:51.900 --> 21:55.600
Girls, guys, puppies.

21:55.600 --> 21:58.500
He's pretty much
an equal opportunity saver.

21:58.500 --> 22:01.800
So you two are, like, a couple?

22:01.800 --> 22:03.900
Me and Angel?

22:03.900 --> 22:06.700
<i>Oh, God, no. He...</i>

22:06.700 --> 22:10.300
He was seeing someone, sort of.

22:10.300 --> 22:15.300
<i>But, she... Angel doesn't date much...</i>

22:15.300 --> 22:18.600
at all... 'cause of his circumstances.

22:18.600 --> 22:21.800
- 'Cause he's a vampire.
- Kind of.

22:21.800 --> 22:27.000
That doesn't mean that...
His situation's just complicated.

22:28.600 --> 22:30.800
Must be lonely.

22:30.800 --> 22:34.200
Sometimes, maybe.

22:34.200 --> 22:38.000
But, it's not like
he doesn't have anyone.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.800
<i>We all...</i>

22:39.800 --> 22:43.000
We try to be there for each other.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.300
- Like a family.
- Yeah.

22:46.300 --> 22:49.300
A demon-hunting, helpless-helping...

22:49.300 --> 22:52.700
dysfunctional family.

22:55.600 --> 22:59.000
<i>You sign this, we're all set to turn</i>
<i>McManus's body over to his family.</i>

23:00.900 --> 23:03.400
They made arrangements to
transport his body back to...

23:03.400 --> 23:06.800
- [Sighs]
- The North Pole.

23:06.800 --> 23:09.600
Turns out he had a close,
personal relationship with Santa.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.300
Angel?

23:15.500 --> 23:18.000
What? Oh, I'm with you.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
Turning over the... Santa?

23:21.000 --> 23:24.600
Angel, you saved that girl's life.

23:24.600 --> 23:27.200
- If you hadn't gotten there when you did...
- Werewolf would've killed her.

23:27.200 --> 23:31.200
I know. Doesn't change what
she's gonna have to go through.

23:31.300 --> 23:35.300
Well, that part sucks, no doubt,
but you did everything you could.

23:35.300 --> 23:39.900
You know what, Gunn? Don't need
a pep talk right now. Just do your job.

23:42.400 --> 23:47.200
Right. I'll just go do that
someplace else.

23:49.700 --> 23:55.400
<i>Whoa, watch it there. Just passin'by and got</i>
<i>splashed with a heap of grouchy.</i>

23:55.400 --> 23:59.300
Gotta tell ya, Angelkins, that extra weight
is not looking so good on you.

23:59.300 --> 24:01.700
I'm talking about psychic pounds, pumpkin.

24:01.700 --> 24:04.700
Why don't you consider me
theJenny Craig for the soul, huh?

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
- So let's hear it.
- I'm not gonna sing.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
Couldn't bear it if you did. No, it's talking
you need. Or maybe a shoulder...

24:16.500 --> 24:19.800
<i>Okay, Atlas, how about a shrug?</i>

24:19.800 --> 24:23.100
Look, so you've got
the weight of the world. [Chuckles]

24:23.100 --> 24:25.200
A burden sure, but breaking news it ain't.

24:25.200 --> 24:28.800
- Listen, Lorne, this isn't a good time.
- No. No, it never is.

24:28.800 --> 24:31.500
Spike showing up your first day in
the Wolfram and Hart saddle?

24:31.500 --> 24:33.700
Took the jolly
right out of the rancher.

24:33.700 --> 24:36.200
We've been feeling it
ever since then, Angelcakes.

24:36.200 --> 24:39.300
Okay, so it's no secret.
I don't like the guy.

24:39.300 --> 24:41.600
Like him, don't like him.
That's up to you.

24:41.600 --> 24:44.800
<i>You're fighting so many enemies around you,</i>
<i>Angel, your punches are getting sloppy.</i>

24:44.800 --> 24:47.900
And we've got
the bruises to prove it.

24:47.900 --> 24:50.200
<i>We're operating in</i>
<i>unfriendly territory, champ.</i>

24:50.200 --> 24:54.200
I don't want you to forget about
the people covering your back.

25:05.600 --> 25:08.300
I changed my mind.

25:08.300 --> 25:11.000
I could go in first, explain...

25:11.000 --> 25:13.800
- No, let's just...
- Hey. I know you're scared...

25:13.800 --> 25:17.200
- but running away's not gonna help.
- [Sighs]

25:18.600 --> 25:20.800
What about fleeing? Can I flee?

25:20.800 --> 25:24.200
Maybe they're not even here.

25:24.200 --> 25:27.000
<i>What the hell happened to you?</i>

25:27.000 --> 25:29.800
I've been worried... Who are you?

25:29.800 --> 25:34.100
- I'm Fred. It's nice...
- I come home, and you're just gone.

25:34.100 --> 25:36.300
- Amanda was terrified.
- Jill, I'm sorry.

25:36.300 --> 25:40.300
Who leaves the house without their purse or
keys? What'd you do, jump out the window?

25:40.300 --> 25:43.600
- I thought Amanda heard me say I was leaving.
- Oh, that's great.

25:43.600 --> 25:46.600
- Blame it on a nine-year-old.
- It's my fault.

25:46.600 --> 25:49.900
I called Nina, like, totally suicidal 'cause
this guy in our ceramics class dumped me.

25:49.900 --> 25:53.100
A-And then my car got towed and she wanted
to call, but my cell phone battery...

25:53.100 --> 25:56.900
Do you mind, whoever you are?
This has nothing to do with you.

25:56.900 --> 25:59.700
- Leave her alone.
- Oh, like you left Mandy alone?

25:59.700 --> 26:02.700
<i>In the house? At night? Do you know</i>
<i>she didn't want to go to school today?</i>

26:02.700 --> 26:06.000
- I had to lie. Tell her I'd heard from you.
- Shut up. Just shut up.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.800
I called the police. I thought...

26:09.800 --> 26:13.700
You sleep all day. You've got bruises
you don't remember getting.

26:13.700 --> 26:17.500
Just tell me. What's going on?

26:19.900 --> 26:22.600
I'm sorry about last night...

26:22.600 --> 26:25.800
but you can't count on me
all the time.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.900
Since when?

26:27.900 --> 26:31.500
Just... find another babysitter.

26:37.700 --> 26:40.300
I'll just... if that's okay.

26:40.300 --> 26:44.800
And, maybe. She's, uh, she'll be okay.

26:46.800 --> 26:50.300
So she was yelling
and furious, but that's good.

26:50.300 --> 26:52.600
It means, you know, she cares.

26:52.600 --> 26:54.800
- If something happened to Amanda...
- But it didn't...

26:54.800 --> 26:56.800
- and it's not going to.
- You don't know that.

26:56.800 --> 26:59.300
Angel... That's weird.

27:06.300 --> 27:10.300
And really not good. Run!

27:12.300 --> 27:14.000
<i>[Nina Screaming]</i>

27:21.800 --> 27:23.600
<i>- [Nina Groans]</i>
<i>- [Cell Phone Rings]</i>

27:23.600 --> 27:28.400
- We got the package.
- Bring it around back. I just had the floors done.

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
No! Let me go! No, don't.

27:40.000 --> 27:44.400
What are you doing? Let me go!

27:44.400 --> 27:47.300
You have to let me go.

27:51.100 --> 27:53.700
Please.

28:05.300 --> 28:06.900
[Crying]

28:11.600 --> 28:13.800
[Gasping]

28:16.600 --> 28:19.800
[Singing Pop]

28:34.200 --> 28:37.900
<i>- [Continues]</i>
<i>- [Wesley]</i>
<i>Lorne's read the entire security team already.</i>

28:37.900 --> 28:40.900
And the lab staff, as well as
half of my department.

28:40.900 --> 28:44.300
<i>If the kidnappers had someone inside</i>
<i>at Wolfram and Hart, Lorne'll know.</i>

28:44.300 --> 28:48.100
What if she was detected somehow,
before we found her?

28:48.100 --> 28:51.400
<i>- Yeah, but by who?</i>
- The scariest thing was how organized they were.

28:51.400 --> 28:53.300
Almost military.

28:53.300 --> 28:56.700
An underground, monster-hunting
military organization.

28:56.700 --> 29:01.900
- It's happened before.
- It's all my fault.

29:01.900 --> 29:05.400
- I'm stupid.
- Anything happens to Nina, it's on me.

29:05.400 --> 29:08.700
"Hmm, that's weird. Why don't I just
approach the mysteriously ajar door?"

29:08.700 --> 29:12.100
Stop with the mocking.
Get enough of that from Blondie Bear.

29:12.100 --> 29:16.600
- Spike. Has anyone seen him...
- Since he went poof? No.

29:18.900 --> 29:21.300
But it's been hours. Angel...

29:23.200 --> 29:26.300
- What do you got?
- Usual suspects.

29:26.300 --> 29:30.300
There's the sacrificers. Wackos who wanna
rid the world of abominations.

29:30.300 --> 29:32.400
<i>And werewolf packs</i>
<i>looking for new recruits.</i>

29:32.400 --> 29:35.900
<i>Then there's the paranormal</i>
<i>sporting groups.</i>

29:35.900 --> 29:39.500
- L... I'll be...
- Vampire hunting in Eastern Europe.

29:39.500 --> 29:41.500
- That kind of thing.
- Spike.

29:43.300 --> 29:45.200
Hey, Spike.

29:47.600 --> 29:50.700
<i>Spike. Stop.</i>

29:57.100 --> 29:59.600
Spike? Spike, wait.

30:00.900 --> 30:03.400
Spike, wait!
[Groans]

30:03.400 --> 30:08.400
Damn. Like he can't hear me.
Just whoot! Right through the...

30:10.800 --> 30:14.200
- Were you looking for me?
- Oh, is this your office?

30:14.200 --> 30:18.000
I'm so sorry. I was following Spike...

30:18.000 --> 30:20.300
and l-I kind of made a mess.

30:20.300 --> 30:23.500
He just went right through the wall.
It's so annoying when he does that...

30:23.500 --> 30:26.800
'cause there's nothing
you can do to...

30:26.800 --> 30:28.300
stop him.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.800
You're right. It's calendula. He must've
known we'd have him sing for Lorne.

30:34.800 --> 30:37.400
So he came prepared
to block the reading.

30:37.400 --> 30:40.200
It's like taking a Valium
to pass a polygraph test.

30:40.200 --> 30:42.800
I knew as soon as I saw
the vial in the trash can.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.800
How'd you end up going through
Royce's trash anyway?

30:44.800 --> 30:48.000
It was, well, Spike.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.200
- He led me in here.
- Yo, here we go.

30:51.200 --> 30:53.400
We got ourselves a secret panel.

30:53.400 --> 30:55.600
- Where is she?
- I don't know what you're...

30:55.600 --> 30:59.100
- Wrong answer.
- But it's a secret.

30:59.100 --> 31:03.100
<i>If I tell you, this man, he's not like you.</i>
<i>You're a good guy.</i>

31:03.100 --> 31:06.200
But he's a... Well, no offense,
but he's scarier than you.

31:06.200 --> 31:08.400
Wanna bet?

31:08.400 --> 31:11.000
Are they...
[Disgusted Sound]

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
We'll just, yeah, burning.
Burning would be good for these.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.600
Not exactly an autopsy knife.

31:17.600 --> 31:19.800
You're not gonna believe this.

31:21.800 --> 31:23.500
Oh, God.

31:29.300 --> 31:33.100
- I know where she is.
- Angel, we found...

31:33.100 --> 31:36.700
- It's what they plan to do to her.
- It's a menu.

31:39.300 --> 31:44.100
<i>- [Creaking]</i>
<i>- [Murmuring]</i>

31:44.100 --> 31:47.500
<i>[Scattered Applause]</i>

31:49.600 --> 31:52.800
[Whimpering]

31:58.000 --> 32:02.900
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you
for coming together on such short notice.

32:02.900 --> 32:06.300
<i>We have a very rare</i>
<i>and special treat for you tonight.</i>

32:06.300 --> 32:10.300
Moonrise is in 15 minutes.

32:11.600 --> 32:13.800
Shortly thereafter...

32:15.000 --> 32:17.700
dinner will be served.

32:24.100 --> 32:26.100
<i>When I dined on werewolf in Seville...</i>

32:26.100 --> 32:31.200
<i>the</i> cocinera <i>used an understated mole</i>
<i>sauce to bring out the meat's tanginess.</i>

32:31.200 --> 32:34.800
I've never forgotten
that exquisite burst of taste.

32:34.800 --> 32:37.800
But Chef Renault swears
serving it <i>anaise...</i>

32:37.800 --> 32:41.800
with a light drizzle of white truffle oil
will be quietly surprising.

32:43.600 --> 32:45.400
<i>[Knocking]</i>

32:55.000 --> 32:58.500
I'm all up in the law now, but damn
it feels good to get my violence on.

32:58.500 --> 33:01.300
- Crane's not gonna like this.
- If I were you, I'd just be hoping the girl's alive.

33:01.300 --> 33:05.300
She has to be, at least through dinner. Once
a werewolf dies, it reverts to its human state.

33:05.300 --> 33:08.600
You mean, to eat werewolf
they gotta eat her alive?

33:08.600 --> 33:11.500
<i>Evan. You've brought guests.</i>

33:11.500 --> 33:14.100
- We're just here to pick up a friend.
- [Cocks Gun]

33:14.100 --> 33:16.000
<i>- [Woman] Watch it.</i>
<i>- [Woman Screams]</i>

33:18.900 --> 33:21.200
- Geez, they garnished you?
- No, get away.

33:21.200 --> 33:24.100
Just let them choke on me.

33:24.100 --> 33:26.800
Listen to me.
Tomorrow you're gonna be home.

33:26.800 --> 33:31.400
This is what I am.
I can't go back there, ever.

33:31.400 --> 33:35.200
- This is better.
- Nothing better about ending up
in a doggie bag.

33:35.500 --> 33:38.500
<i>- [Clattering]</i>
- What, no leprechaun soufflé?

33:38.500 --> 33:40.700
There's no such thing as leprechauns.

33:45.200 --> 33:49.200
- We've hit a snag.
- We're not leaving without the girl.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.200
I'm willing to let my men die.
Can you say the same?

33:54.200 --> 33:58.700
- I go, you're going with me.
- It's a risk. What can I say?

33:58.700 --> 34:00.800
You probably should've
told me to drop this.

34:16.699 --> 34:19.500
[Relieved Sigh]

34:19.500 --> 34:23.199
- This is the part where we take our friend and go.
<i>- I'm afraid not.</i>

34:23.199 --> 34:25.800
Tonight may not be salvageable...

34:25.800 --> 34:30.400
but my guests have paid a high price,
some higher than others.

34:30.400 --> 34:33.600
<i>And I promised them a werewolf.</i>

34:33.600 --> 34:36.000
- [Growls]
- [Screams]

34:38.300 --> 34:42.100
<i>- [Royce Groaning]</i>
- And a month from now you'll have one.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
No. No.

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
Mr. Crane, please.
Oh, no. No, please.

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
<i>Don't do this to me,</i>
<i>Mr. Crane. I'm sorry.</i>

34:56.000 --> 34:59.400
[Whimpering]
Mr. Crane, I'm sorry.

34:59.400 --> 35:02.200
<i>No. Oh.! Oh.!</i>

35:02.200 --> 35:05.800
Mr. Crane, I'm begging you. No.

35:22.500 --> 35:24.000
[Gasps]

35:24.000 --> 35:27.100
[Exhales]
Spike.

35:32.400 --> 35:34.500
I've been looking for you.

35:39.300 --> 35:43.000
You were there again.

35:43.000 --> 35:46.600
Where you go when you're not...

35:46.600 --> 35:49.000
here.

35:51.600 --> 35:54.100
There.

35:54.100 --> 35:56.400
Nowhere.

35:58.100 --> 36:02.500
[Forced Chuckle]
I didn't think I was coming back.

36:04.100 --> 36:08.000
But you did... mostly.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
And you led me to
Dr. Royce's office, which was...

36:15.700 --> 36:19.000
completely not on purpose, was it?

36:20.700 --> 36:25.000
But, still, you're here.

36:26.700 --> 36:32.100
Last gasp before eternal fire
and brimstone. Let's party.

36:32.100 --> 36:34.300
We have to tell Angel.

36:34.300 --> 36:36.100
- No.
<i>- But he could do something.</i>

36:36.100 --> 36:39.600
- Talk to the senior partners.
- I said no.

36:39.600 --> 36:43.600
Okay, then I'm going to help you.
Well, I don't know exactly...

36:43.800 --> 36:46.100
but I am going to
find a way to bring you back.

36:46.100 --> 36:50.600
<i>Really bring you back. I promise.</i>

36:52.400 --> 36:53.900
Well, all right, then.

36:55.400 --> 36:57.300
No need to get dramatic.

37:10.200 --> 37:14.000
[Singing]

37:15.900 --> 37:17.700
This is it.

37:19.200 --> 37:21.500
She's a really good artist.

37:21.500 --> 37:24.800
Oh, our refrigerator's always available
if she's looking to show.

37:27.800 --> 37:30.600
How do you live with it?

37:30.600 --> 37:34.500
Knowing that you've killed people?

37:34.500 --> 37:37.300
Nina, they were going to
eat you for dinner.

37:39.500 --> 37:42.900
I just wanna wake up, you know?

37:42.900 --> 37:46.100
<i>At some point, you'll be</i>
<i>at the grocery store or with Amanda...</i>

37:46.100 --> 37:51.300
and, the whole werewolf thing,
it'll just be a part of who you are.

37:51.300 --> 37:55.700
Next you're gonna tell me
you actually like being a vampire.

37:57.100 --> 38:00.300
Well, being nearly indestructible's cool.

38:03.400 --> 38:05.600
I can't tell them.

38:05.600 --> 38:07.800
<i>Maybe, maybe not.</i>

38:07.800 --> 38:10.300
That part's not covered in the manual.

38:12.800 --> 38:15.000
They're waiting for you.

38:17.400 --> 38:20.800
You don't ever think about letting go?

38:20.800 --> 38:23.200
Disappearing somewhere?

38:25.900 --> 38:29.600
Look, if you separate yourself from the ones
you love, the monster wins.

38:29.600 --> 38:33.200
- You make it sound simple.
- It's not.

38:36.700 --> 38:38.500
See you next month.

38:44.100 --> 38:45.800
<i>[Car Door Closes]</i>

38:51.300 --> 38:55.300
<i>[Pop]</i>

39:06.900 --> 39:09.100
[Engine Starts]

39:14.200 --> 39:17.200
<i>[Lorne]</i>
<i>Mmm. Talk about a room with a view.</i>

39:17.200 --> 39:19.900
<i>- [Fred] Wow, is that the hotel?</i>
<i>- [Wesley] Where?</i>

39:19.900 --> 39:23.400
- No, I think that's the Center for Scientology.
- Oh. Right.

39:23.400 --> 39:25.500
They look, um,
nothing alike at all.

39:25.500 --> 39:28.100
I was starting to think we were never
gonna see the inside of this place.

39:28.100 --> 39:30.300
I'm sorry. I probably should've
had you guys over sooner...

39:30.300 --> 39:32.600
but I'm trying to get
used to the place myself.

39:32.600 --> 39:35.400
Look at this.

39:35.400 --> 39:38.500
I'm home.
Hey, Cosmos all around?

39:38.500 --> 39:41.000
<i>- [Fred] Sounds good.</i>
- Quite luxurious.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.700
It's not bad.

39:42.700 --> 39:45.700
- Don't mean to talk shop,
but Crane's Bistro of the Bizarre?
<i>- Out ofbusiness.</i>

39:45.700 --> 39:48.100
- Permanently.
- What if I have a craving for Sasquatch soup?

39:48.100 --> 39:50.300
Is that something you English eat
with your beans on toast?

39:50.300 --> 39:54.200
Mmm, you guys are making me hungry.
Who wants Chinese?

39:54.200 --> 39:56.600
As long as nothing
comes tartare, I'm in.

39:56.600 --> 40:01.000
- No, I'm too tired to make any decisions.
- Just order the usual, Fredikins.

40:01.000 --> 40:05.500
- I'm buying.
- Ladies and gentlemen, hell just froze over.

40:05.500 --> 40:07.800
So, werewolf girl.
Think you got a shot?

40:07.800 --> 40:10.700
- She gave me a look.
<i>- [Wesley] Really?</i>

40:10.700 --> 40:13.500
A look?

40:14.900 --> 40:17.800
<i>We moved, actually, to a law firm.</i>

40:17.800 --> 40:21.700
Uh-huh. Different. No. Nice.

40:21.700 --> 40:26.200
Okay. Um, one mu shu chicken.
Two beef and broccolis.

40:26.200 --> 40:30.900
<i>One cashew shrimp.</i>
<i>Um, maybe some lettuce wraps.</i>
