00:00.767 --> 00:02.436
NARRATOR: Previously
on "Total Divas."

00:02.436 --> 00:05.105
We have an opportunity,
making you guys a tag team.

00:05.105 --> 00:06.840
That girl will try to bury you.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.308
Seems to be a little
miscommunication.

00:08.308 --> 00:09.243
Why didn't you tag me?

00:09.243 --> 00:10.644
My hand's out there for you.

00:10.644 --> 00:11.612
I am so pissed.

00:11.612 --> 00:12.946
I was your only ally.

00:12.946 --> 00:14.615
Now you can go [BLEEP] yourself.
-All right, fine.

00:14.615 --> 00:15.415
Walk away.

00:15.415 --> 00:18.619
When I first came into the
WWE, the other girls and me

00:18.619 --> 00:20.487
were going at each other's
throats a little bit.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.758
Now throughout this
whole summer drama,

00:24.758 --> 00:27.227
every one of these
girls has my back.

00:27.227 --> 00:28.161
Let her roll!

00:28.161 --> 00:29.997
Wrestlemania's right
around the corner.

00:29.997 --> 00:32.833
You girls better watch out.

00:32.833 --> 00:34.201
She looks like she's hurt.

00:34.201 --> 00:36.403
I've never felt pain this bad.

00:40.874 --> 00:44.878
[THEME MUSIC]

00:50.350 --> 00:53.820
ANNOUNCER: I think it's
snowing outside here in Omaha.

00:53.820 --> 00:57.324
What would you call that?

00:57.324 --> 00:58.625
So it's Naomi versus Oksana.

00:58.625 --> 01:00.861
And AJ is on a roll.

01:00.861 --> 01:01.662
Oh!

01:05.098 --> 01:06.099
Wow.

01:06.099 --> 01:08.101
Holy-- a knee right to the face?

01:08.101 --> 01:11.505
Oksana comes down on my eye
full force with her knee.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.607
I have never felt pain
like this in my life.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.142
But regardless of
what I'm feeling

01:15.142 --> 01:16.877
and what I'm going through,
the show must go on,

01:16.877 --> 01:19.079
and I am in so much pain.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.514
She is certainly
from planet funk,

01:20.514 --> 01:22.349
because that butt is
out of this world.

01:22.349 --> 01:23.684
ANNOUNCER: Well, she's
pinned you twice.

01:23.684 --> 01:26.086
Maybe you should give
her a shot at your title.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.654
Stomach move by Naomi.

01:27.654 --> 01:33.994
Hooking the leg yet again,
and Naomi picks up the win!

01:33.994 --> 01:36.430
And there's Cameron!

01:36.430 --> 01:37.898
AJ called her a cheerleader.

01:37.898 --> 01:40.834
She's pretty formidable.

01:40.834 --> 01:41.768
Oh!

01:41.768 --> 01:43.804
Naomi calls that the rear view.

01:43.804 --> 01:46.073
Well, what do you
think now, champ?

01:46.073 --> 01:47.708
You think you'll give
Naomi a title shot?

01:47.708 --> 01:50.043
Come on, you said you were
a fighting champion, AJ.

01:50.043 --> 01:51.411
You said you'll
take on all comers.

01:51.411 --> 01:52.679
Naomi's earned it.

01:52.679 --> 01:53.914
She looks like
she's really hurt.

01:57.317 --> 01:59.286
Dude, Trin can't open her eye.

01:59.286 --> 02:02.255
You see that?

02:02.255 --> 02:03.724
Yeah, John's waiting.

02:03.724 --> 02:04.691
See?

02:04.691 --> 02:06.159
John's waiting for her.

02:09.096 --> 02:11.431
The doctors look at my
eye, and they tell me

02:11.431 --> 02:12.899
that I need to go
to the hospital

02:12.899 --> 02:16.203
to get my eye x-rayed to find
out if it's broken or not.

02:16.203 --> 02:18.071
Oh no, she's holding her head.

02:18.071 --> 02:19.706
What the [BLEEP]?

02:19.706 --> 02:20.507
Yeah.

02:24.344 --> 02:25.812
I'm confused on what happened.

02:27.414 --> 02:28.215
Yeah.

02:28.215 --> 02:29.216
How does he know?

02:34.988 --> 02:37.090
The situation is
completely crazy.

02:37.090 --> 02:41.395
I've never really seen Trin
get hurt ever, so it's scary.

02:41.395 --> 02:42.996
When she goes immediately
to the trainer,

02:42.996 --> 02:45.532
I know something is
severely wrong with her.

02:45.532 --> 02:47.534
Should we get her
stuff together for her?

02:47.534 --> 02:49.169
We could just pack
her [BLEEP] up,

02:49.169 --> 02:50.437
and that way it's
already ready to go.

02:50.437 --> 02:52.572
Trinity and I are
the Funkadactyls.

02:52.572 --> 02:56.209
If she's out, I don't know
what that means for me.

02:56.209 --> 02:58.011
But all I can think
about is her health

02:58.011 --> 03:00.047
right now, so as
long as she's OK,

03:00.047 --> 03:01.281
that's all that really matters.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:21.568 --> 03:22.769
I know.

03:22.769 --> 03:24.237
They should have
taken that [INAUDIBLE].

03:24.237 --> 03:25.038
They could have.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.340
Maybe we could
bring it back soon.

03:27.340 --> 03:28.141
Natty.

03:28.141 --> 03:29.776
I got my shirt.

03:29.776 --> 03:32.245
Aw, yay.

03:32.245 --> 03:33.914
Your shirt is right there
with all the top dudes.

03:33.914 --> 03:34.715
I know.

03:34.715 --> 03:35.515
Isn't that cool?

03:35.515 --> 03:36.917
That is frickin' amazing.

03:36.917 --> 03:37.718
Bam.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.654
This is gonna sound awful,
but I bought, like, 10.

03:40.654 --> 03:41.455
It's natural.

03:41.455 --> 03:42.889
This is all fun,
but I miss Booboo.

03:42.889 --> 03:43.690
I know.

03:43.690 --> 03:44.825
I miss Trin too.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.226
I talked to her and
she's like, you know,

03:46.226 --> 03:47.894
she's going to go to the
doctor to find out if she

03:47.894 --> 03:48.929
has to have surgery or not.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.764
Did they say when
she'll come back, or--

03:50.764 --> 03:52.199
If she has to
have surgery, they

03:52.199 --> 03:55.335
said it can be three months,
but if she doesn't have surgery,

03:55.335 --> 03:56.803
it could be like, 4-8 weeks.

03:56.803 --> 03:59.439
So I'm praying, because
that's your face.

03:59.439 --> 04:01.341
Trinity's eye is so
damaged right now,

04:01.341 --> 04:03.910
it could be anything
from a bruised orbital

04:03.910 --> 04:05.078
or broken socket.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.147
I just pray Trin can just
recover and come back

04:07.147 --> 04:08.715
stronger, and better than ever.

04:08.715 --> 04:09.983
That's just scary.

04:09.983 --> 04:10.817
I know.

04:10.817 --> 04:12.819
Trinity right now is on fire.

04:12.819 --> 04:16.757
She's really coming up in her
career, and bam, this happened.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.759
And it sucks
because Wrestlemania

04:18.759 --> 04:20.660
is just around the corner.

04:20.660 --> 04:23.530
These are the bumps
of being a WWE diva.

04:23.530 --> 04:25.599
You are prone to get injured.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.967
It's gonna suck,
like, getting married,

04:26.967 --> 04:29.169
walking down the aisle, and
it's like, all the bruises.

04:29.169 --> 04:30.971
I'm about to pull a little tan.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.105
I need a tan like nobody's--

04:32.105 --> 04:33.073
Uh, Cabo.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.040
Cabo!

04:34.040 --> 04:35.642
We've been planning
Brie's bachelorette

04:35.642 --> 04:36.676
for the past few months.

04:36.676 --> 04:39.446
We've never been to
Cabo San Lucas, Mexico,

04:39.446 --> 04:41.014
so we figured that
will be the best

04:41.014 --> 04:44.918
spot to just get crazy, get into
Brie mode, and have some fun.

04:44.918 --> 04:45.719
Really fun.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.320
We'll lay out, drink.

04:47.320 --> 04:48.121
Yeah.

04:48.121 --> 04:48.922
Swim.

04:48.922 --> 04:49.723
Drink.

04:49.723 --> 04:50.657
Will we just--

04:50.657 --> 04:51.591
Open up dirty gifts.

04:51.591 --> 04:52.526
Drink.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.494
We can go zip lining and
play with the dolphins, and--

04:54.494 --> 04:54.895
No.
Whoa.

04:54.895 --> 04:55.262
Zip lining?

04:55.262 --> 04:57.397
I haven't made a sand castle
since I was like, seven.

05:00.167 --> 05:01.868
What?

05:01.868 --> 05:02.702
I can't.

05:02.702 --> 05:03.570
Bye, ladies.

05:03.570 --> 05:04.371
Bye, girl.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.480
Hi.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.281
Hey.

05:16.716 --> 05:17.884
What's going on with Cabo?

05:17.884 --> 05:18.685
Oh, yeah.

05:18.685 --> 05:19.486
We're all going.

05:19.486 --> 05:20.353
Are you going?

05:20.353 --> 05:21.721
I asked Natty to like,
tell me about it,

05:21.721 --> 05:23.523
and she said she didn't know
if you were doing or not.

05:23.523 --> 05:24.558
Yeah.
I'm going.

05:24.558 --> 05:26.626
I think you're the
only one not going.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.998
I just thought we were kind
of like, turned a new leaf

05:31.998 --> 05:34.768
and on another page, but
I'll talk to her about that.

05:34.768 --> 05:37.304
I think, like, all
the girls kind of-- you

05:37.304 --> 05:39.406
like, burned your bridges
by talking about everyone.

05:39.406 --> 05:40.373
So, I don't know.

05:40.373 --> 05:41.174
I'd think about that.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.076
But I'll have fun
in Cabo for you.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.678
OK.
I'm sure you will.

05:48.381 --> 05:49.182
Are you gonna go?

06:20.146 --> 06:22.582
We have just landed
in Cabo, and I

06:22.582 --> 06:24.651
am just so excited to be here.

06:24.651 --> 06:26.953
Mexico is the one
place that you just

06:26.953 --> 06:29.155
get out of control and wild.

06:29.155 --> 06:31.691
Girlies, are you sure you
don't want a road soda?

06:31.691 --> 06:33.159
I'm good.

06:33.159 --> 06:34.094
It's my bachelorette.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.899
OK, good.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.234
Their airport has a bar
when you're leaving it.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.436
Like, talk about road sodas.

06:43.436 --> 06:44.337
Are you kidding me?

06:44.337 --> 06:46.506
This trip is going
to be amazing.

06:46.506 --> 06:47.974
Woo!

06:47.974 --> 06:50.911
Gracias, papi.

06:50.911 --> 06:51.878
Who's been to Cabo?

06:51.878 --> 06:52.846
I've never been to Cabo.

06:52.846 --> 06:54.247
I've always wanted to go.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.682
We're all virgins.

06:55.682 --> 06:56.483
Yeah.

06:56.483 --> 06:57.550
At least a virgin in something.

07:02.222 --> 07:03.290
Know what we should do, though?

07:03.290 --> 07:04.858
We should get some board games.

07:08.395 --> 07:10.830
So, I kind of have a
secret, and I haven't really

07:10.830 --> 07:13.266
told any of the girls
this, except Trinity,

07:13.266 --> 07:15.402
but I am a recovering alcoholic.

07:17.570 --> 07:18.405
Right?

07:18.405 --> 07:20.106
I was abusing alcohol.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.275
Things were just spiraling
out of control for me,

07:22.275 --> 07:25.178
but I'm so excited
to even be going

07:25.178 --> 07:27.847
to this bachelorette
party, so I don't really

07:27.847 --> 07:30.116
want to say anything to them
quite yet, just because I don't

07:30.116 --> 07:31.618
want to bring everybody down.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.019
I can't wait to
pop some champagne.

07:35.755 --> 07:38.224
I really believed I was gonna
be the next Divas champion.

07:38.224 --> 07:40.527
I've worked so
hard to have a shot

07:40.527 --> 07:41.795
at the title at Wrestlemania.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.763
I may never get this
opportunity again.

07:43.763 --> 07:45.832
I think John will totally
ask you to marry him.

07:45.832 --> 07:47.801
Um, no.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.402
The only wedding I'm
gonna have is the one

07:49.402 --> 07:50.603
that I had when I was 20.

07:50.603 --> 07:51.972
What?

07:51.972 --> 07:52.939
Are you joking?

08:03.016 --> 08:04.751
Oh my god.

08:04.751 --> 08:06.119
This is amazing.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.757
Isn't that insane?

08:10.757 --> 08:13.360
Honestly, this place looks
like an Italian villa.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.294
It's stunning.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.596
This is like a dream.

08:16.596 --> 08:18.765
This is-- holy [BLEEP].

08:22.669 --> 08:24.137
Oh my gosh.

08:24.137 --> 08:28.441
It has this pool that's like,
overlooking to the ocean.

08:28.441 --> 08:30.543
This is amazing.

08:30.543 --> 08:31.578
Hi.

08:31.578 --> 08:32.412
Gosh!

08:32.412 --> 08:34.681
We all have our own rooms.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.082
Whoa.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.484
Serious?

08:37.484 --> 08:40.687
This is the [BLEEP] right here.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.589
What are we doing again today?

08:42.589 --> 08:44.891
I want to go swimming
with the dolphins.

08:44.891 --> 08:46.359
What else?

08:46.359 --> 08:49.429
Well, I wanted to also go mini
golf, do some mini golf stuff.

08:49.429 --> 08:50.330
Mini golf would be fun.

08:50.330 --> 08:51.531
Who doesn't like mini golf?
-No.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.332
Not here.

08:52.332 --> 08:53.800
OK, you see this
beautiful house?

08:53.800 --> 08:55.335
You want to go mini golf?

08:55.335 --> 08:58.004
Well, can I still-- can we
do anything that I want to do?

08:58.004 --> 08:59.005
How about board games?

08:59.005 --> 09:01.107
I bought Sorry.

09:01.107 --> 09:02.475
Natty, you need
to turn up, girl.

09:02.475 --> 09:03.676
-And then there's--
-Turn up.

09:03.676 --> 09:05.678
Natty's over here talking
about all this stuff

09:05.678 --> 09:06.679
that's just, like, no.

09:06.679 --> 09:07.981
We're in Cabo.

09:07.981 --> 09:10.683
Girl, it's time to take
off those granny panties,

09:10.683 --> 09:12.752
put a thong on, and
shake it real hard.

09:12.752 --> 09:13.853
It's time to get Brie mode.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.322
-Yeah.
-Exactly.

09:16.322 --> 09:17.390
I like the way
Ariana's talking.

09:17.390 --> 09:17.991
But board games are
fun, because they

09:17.991 --> 09:20.026
get everybody thinking, and they
get your critical thinking--

09:20.026 --> 09:21.861
Where's your margarita?

09:21.861 --> 09:22.662
Over there.

09:22.662 --> 09:23.997
-Do you need one?
-No, I'm good.

09:23.997 --> 09:24.798
Do you want one?

09:24.798 --> 09:27.300
I'm good.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.234
Yes.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.836
-Yes.
-Yes!

09:29.836 --> 09:31.237
Yes!
Yes!

09:31.237 --> 09:32.205
Yes!

09:32.205 --> 09:33.006
Yes!

09:40.146 --> 09:41.147
Like this.

09:50.557 --> 09:52.058
You're such a bitch.

09:59.499 --> 10:00.967
Oh my god!

10:00.967 --> 10:04.137
Cabo, bitches!

10:04.137 --> 10:07.674
All the girls are here,
the sun is still out.

10:07.674 --> 10:09.175
It's Brie mode time.

10:09.175 --> 10:11.611
[SHOUTING]

10:12.745 --> 10:13.546
Brie mode!

10:21.354 --> 10:24.257
Ice does a lot of things, Trin.

10:24.257 --> 10:25.258
Gosh.

10:25.258 --> 10:26.326
Makes your drink cold.

10:29.262 --> 10:30.897
And brings the swelling down.

10:30.897 --> 10:32.031
I know you ain't
laying on my bed.

10:32.031 --> 10:33.333
Get your ass up.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.135
I'm home, I've been
pulled off the road

10:35.135 --> 10:36.970
for I don't know how long.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.204
I need to heal.

10:38.204 --> 10:40.006
I'm still in a lot of pain.

10:40.006 --> 10:42.475
I can't move my eye at all.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.277
This is just the worst.

10:44.277 --> 10:50.617
I was at the best spot in
my career, almost about

10:50.617 --> 10:54.254
to have an amazing angle in
the storyline, title shot.

10:54.254 --> 10:58.391
I'm gonna have to sit home
and watch everything unfold,

10:58.391 --> 11:00.527
or whatever is going to happen.

11:00.527 --> 11:04.130
Just feeling like that's
supposed to be me.

11:04.130 --> 11:07.567
I was on the road to having a
huge title match against AJ.

11:07.567 --> 11:08.668
ANNOUNCER: I tell
you what, I think

11:08.668 --> 11:10.170
we're somebody
that might finally

11:10.170 --> 11:12.405
unseat the WWE Divas champion.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.274
And things are heating up.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.709
Now that all of this has
happened, that's up in the air

11:16.709 --> 11:17.510
now.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.946
It's hard to go from
being on the rise

11:19.946 --> 11:23.483
and going up here, to literally
starting back down here.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.585
I've wored so hard
to have a shot

11:25.585 --> 11:26.920
at the title at Wrestlmania.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.788
I may never get this
opportunity again.

11:28.788 --> 11:32.392
I feel like the rug was
pulled out from under me.

11:32.392 --> 11:33.593
You'll be back up there again.

11:36.229 --> 11:38.898
You'll be right, right in the
mix like, like you never left.

11:41.334 --> 11:42.168
You will.

11:49.576 --> 11:51.477
I don't know about you guys,
but I'm [BLEEP] faced right

11:51.477 --> 11:52.645
now, so I'm about
to eat some food,

11:52.645 --> 11:54.280
I'm gonna take a 30 minute nap.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.615
Yeah.

11:55.615 --> 11:56.983
No, you guys can't nap.

11:56.983 --> 11:58.084
That's a rule.

11:58.084 --> 11:59.652
Where's Eva's drink?

11:59.652 --> 12:00.753
You both need drinks.

12:00.753 --> 12:02.889
How could you be
here and not drink?

12:02.889 --> 12:05.091
We need another
margarita for Eva.

12:05.091 --> 12:08.394
Well, I'm just happy you
guys are here, honestly.

12:08.394 --> 12:09.362
Yay.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.164
I'm really happy Eva's here.

12:11.164 --> 12:14.667
Even I had a little rough
patch in the beginning,

12:14.667 --> 12:17.103
but we got through it, and
now we love each other.

12:17.103 --> 12:19.839
Yes.

12:19.839 --> 12:23.476
When I met Eva a year ago, she
didn't rub me the right way.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.044
We hit heads really bad.

12:25.044 --> 12:27.714
As the year's gone by,
and Eva and I really

12:27.714 --> 12:31.084
have gotten to know each other,
I absolutely adore the girl,

12:31.084 --> 12:32.852
and now we've
become super close.

12:32.852 --> 12:35.455
You know what's crazy, is my
mom when I was younger actually

12:35.455 --> 12:37.023
used to say the ones
when you meet you don't

12:37.023 --> 12:38.625
like at first
usually end up being,

12:38.625 --> 12:39.759
like, your greatest friends.

12:39.759 --> 12:40.560
Always.

12:40.560 --> 12:41.928
Because you're
so-- isn't it crazy?

12:41.928 --> 12:43.563
I've heard that before.

12:43.563 --> 12:44.364
Yes.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.136
Let's all wear
our birthday suits.

12:50.136 --> 12:53.072
I got, like, the
jewels in the back.

12:53.072 --> 12:53.873
Woo!

12:53.873 --> 12:55.675
That hurt my hand.

12:55.675 --> 12:58.611
It's pretty firm, right?

12:58.611 --> 12:59.612
That actually hurt.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.247
Love it.

13:01.247 --> 13:02.181
That actually was nice.

13:02.181 --> 13:02.982
That was good.

13:02.982 --> 13:04.684
Yeah, that was a good one.

13:07.987 --> 13:08.788
Natty!

13:08.788 --> 13:10.523
You need to go get
another mararita.

13:10.523 --> 13:11.824
-No.
-Yes!

13:11.824 --> 13:12.725
Why not?

13:12.725 --> 13:14.494
No, we're getting
[BLEEP] faced together.

13:14.494 --> 13:15.662
Who cares?

13:15.662 --> 13:18.898
Nicole, this is my third drink
today, it's not even 3:00.

13:18.898 --> 13:19.699
Oh man, you guys--

13:19.699 --> 13:21.334
How about John yesterday?

13:21.334 --> 13:22.201
He's in San Diego.

13:22.201 --> 13:24.437
He drove to my nana's house.

13:24.437 --> 13:25.238
That's just insane.

13:25.238 --> 13:28.341
He literally drove two hours
just to hang out with nana.

13:28.341 --> 13:29.676
I told Brian, I go,
I bet he's asking

13:29.676 --> 13:30.910
nana for her hand in marriage.
-Oh, god.

13:30.910 --> 13:32.312
Just tease me even more.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.314
I know-- Nicole,
I seriously felt

13:34.314 --> 13:36.282
like he was going to-- like,
no, why would he do that?

13:36.282 --> 13:37.684
I would think so
too, but he just

13:37.684 --> 13:38.785
wants to hang out with her.

13:38.785 --> 13:41.020
I've known John as long
as Nicole has known John.

13:41.020 --> 13:42.388
I've noticed something
great in the sense

13:42.388 --> 13:45.124
that John is now
changing, in the way

13:45.124 --> 13:46.793
that he's better,
in the way that he's

13:46.793 --> 13:48.528
really committed to Nicole.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.096
This is such a cute bikini.

13:50.096 --> 13:50.997
Thank you.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.699
You want to get
those legs, Natty.

13:52.699 --> 13:53.866
Get them [INAUDIBLE].

13:59.439 --> 14:00.773
What are you guys
wearing tonight?

14:05.545 --> 14:06.713
I'm like, shot.

14:06.713 --> 14:08.514
And you could tell me
with my eyes closed.

14:08.514 --> 14:10.283
I'm still listening.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.250
Rest your eyes?

14:11.250 --> 14:12.051
That's--

14:12.051 --> 14:14.554
You sleepy.

14:14.554 --> 14:15.521
Have to kick out.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.056
It's your bachelorette party.

14:17.056 --> 14:20.259
Where are your bathing
suit pant bottoms from?

14:20.259 --> 14:21.260
You like 'em?

14:21.260 --> 14:22.495
Oh, damn.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.297
Damn.

14:24.297 --> 14:28.201
The best situation for me is
to not be around alcohol at all.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.470
But I'm trying to just
be a good sport and bond

14:30.470 --> 14:31.404
with Brie a little bit.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.339
You can't walk out and be like,
hey, guys, I'm ready for--

14:33.339 --> 14:34.907
Actually, people'd
be like this.

14:34.907 --> 14:36.008
They'd be like this.

14:36.008 --> 14:36.809
Hi.

14:41.013 --> 14:42.248
You have great breasts.

14:42.248 --> 14:43.282
Thank you.

14:43.282 --> 14:45.017
I just talked to
John for a while.

14:45.017 --> 14:46.486
Really?
How is he?

14:46.486 --> 14:47.286
I miss him.

14:47.286 --> 14:48.087
Oh, I miss John.

14:48.087 --> 14:49.689
He says hi, by the way.
-Oh, good.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.023
I want to send him a picture.

14:51.023 --> 14:52.792
He's missing me.

14:52.792 --> 14:53.993
He's so cute.

14:53.993 --> 14:55.661
He just sits around
and waits for me.

14:55.661 --> 14:58.398
It's very, very hard for us
to be away from each other.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.033
We get sad when it's like,
two hours away from us,

15:01.033 --> 15:03.236
like, knowing we have
to, like, depart.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.104
You guys are meant
for each other.

15:05.104 --> 15:05.905
Yeah.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.840
I think John kind of
almost-- I don't-- I

15:07.840 --> 15:08.808
could be wrong about this.

15:08.808 --> 15:09.976
I almost feel like
he wanted people

15:09.976 --> 15:11.444
to think that he was
like, more of a playboy

15:11.444 --> 15:12.378
than he actually is.

15:12.378 --> 15:15.081
And then once he met
you, like, he kind of

15:15.081 --> 15:15.982
showed that softer side.

15:15.982 --> 15:19.118
That he actually-- I think
John is very committed to you.

15:19.118 --> 15:20.987
I think John will totally
ask you to marry him.

15:20.987 --> 15:21.788
Huh.

15:21.788 --> 15:22.588
No.

15:22.588 --> 15:23.456
Yeah.

15:23.456 --> 15:24.257
I guarantee you.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.759
I'd put money on it.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.060
I'd bet my Diva-hood on it.

15:28.060 --> 15:28.861
Yeah?

15:32.632 --> 15:36.569
Um-- no.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.971
Yeah.

15:38.971 --> 15:40.373
The only wedding I'm
gonna have is the one

15:40.373 --> 15:41.874
that I had when I was 20.

15:41.874 --> 15:43.009
What?

15:43.009 --> 15:44.310
You weren't married before?

15:45.745 --> 15:46.546
No.

15:46.546 --> 15:49.449
Are you joking?

15:49.449 --> 15:50.249
Brie mode.

15:50.249 --> 15:51.784
Brie mode.

15:51.784 --> 15:55.721
I am so excited to
get this party started.

15:55.721 --> 15:58.024
Let's bring it on.

15:58.024 --> 15:59.025
I'm a little bit scared.

15:59.025 --> 16:03.429
Everything is so overwhelming.

16:03.429 --> 16:05.865
I wish that I could take a shot.

16:05.865 --> 16:06.833
I wish I could drink.

16:13.439 --> 16:15.875
I think John will totally
ask you to marry him.

16:15.875 --> 16:17.076
-No.
-Yeah.

16:17.076 --> 16:17.877
I guarantee you.

16:17.877 --> 16:20.413
I'd put money on it.

16:20.413 --> 16:21.347
I'd bet my Diva-hood on it.

16:21.347 --> 16:22.148
Yeah?

16:26.352 --> 16:30.223
Um-- no.

16:30.223 --> 16:32.358
Yeah.

16:32.358 --> 16:33.526
The only wedding
I'm gonna have is

16:33.526 --> 16:35.027
one that I had when I was 20.

16:35.027 --> 16:36.395
What?

16:36.395 --> 16:38.664
You weren't married before?

16:38.664 --> 16:40.500
No.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.300
Maybe.

16:44.270 --> 16:47.173
Are you joking?

16:47.173 --> 16:50.243
Oh, [BLEEP].

16:50.243 --> 16:52.345
It was my high
school sweetheart.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.614
It was [BLEEP].

16:54.614 --> 16:56.048
Oh my god.

16:56.048 --> 16:58.584
I was in Uggs, and my hair
was like-- like, I wasn't even

16:58.584 --> 17:01.120
dressed to get, like, married.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.989
We went into the
courthouse and everything.

17:02.989 --> 17:03.789
Does John know?

17:09.962 --> 17:12.665
So yes, I was married before.

17:12.665 --> 17:16.636
There was never a diamond
ring, we never lived together.

17:16.636 --> 17:19.271
We were high school
sweethearts, and we

17:19.271 --> 17:21.707
just decided one
day, hey, wouldn't it

17:21.707 --> 17:23.409
be fun to get married?

17:23.409 --> 17:24.810
Let's go to Vegas.

17:24.810 --> 17:29.148
Ends we were married for a few
years, and never took his name.

17:29.148 --> 17:30.783
Actually, after we got
married, we didn't really

17:30.783 --> 17:34.153
talk much longer, and then
realized a few years later when

17:34.153 --> 17:35.588
we started dating
people, like, oh, hey,

17:35.588 --> 17:37.023
we should get a divorce.

17:37.023 --> 17:38.457
I got an annulment.

17:38.457 --> 17:41.160
It was a tough part of my
life that I just try to erase.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.563
Yeah.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.363
Dang, Nikki.

17:44.363 --> 17:46.632
You get it all soggy in there?

17:46.632 --> 17:47.667
Breezy!

17:47.667 --> 17:51.804
We're just talking about
Nicole's first husband.

17:51.804 --> 17:54.540
I had no idea that
Nicole was married.

17:54.540 --> 17:56.409
Yeah.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.077
It was, like, a big secret.

17:58.077 --> 18:01.147
There's my sister sitting
in the tub, like Scarface,

18:01.147 --> 18:05.818
and bam, she tells Natty her 10
year secret that only I know.

18:05.818 --> 18:08.120
Yeah, after margaritas
she'll tell anything.

18:14.293 --> 18:16.062
I just wanted to do a
little toast to Brie.

18:16.062 --> 18:18.998
I think you're going to
make the most amazing wife,

18:18.998 --> 18:22.969
and until then, we are going
to get into serious Brie mode.

18:22.969 --> 18:23.736
Yes.

18:23.736 --> 18:24.704
Brie mode.

18:24.704 --> 18:25.905
Brie mode!

18:25.905 --> 18:29.375
I am so excited to
get this party started.

18:29.375 --> 18:30.576
Let's bring it on.

18:30.576 --> 18:31.644
Are we ready to go eat?

18:31.644 --> 18:32.445
Get some energy.

18:32.445 --> 18:35.047
Time for you to get
that Brie mode on.

18:35.047 --> 18:36.048
Yes.

18:36.048 --> 18:37.049
Yes.

18:37.049 --> 18:37.850
Yes!

18:41.487 --> 18:42.989
Hello, Mexico.

18:42.989 --> 18:43.956
Woo!

18:43.956 --> 18:45.958
Holler, bitches.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.827
Oh my gosh.

18:47.827 --> 18:50.062
Brie, so I wanted
to surprise you.

18:50.062 --> 18:51.063
Yeah right, bitch.

18:51.063 --> 18:55.167
You have to get somebody
to take a picture of us.

18:55.167 --> 18:56.902
What are you guys
getting to drink?

18:56.902 --> 18:57.937
What are you guys getting?

18:59.505 --> 19:01.407
Water?

19:01.407 --> 19:02.842
I think I'm gonna get
a skinny margarita.

19:02.842 --> 19:06.379
I think everyone's gonna get
the same drink, except her.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.848
Well, I'll do that, and
then all waters, too.

19:08.848 --> 19:09.649
Thank you.

19:09.649 --> 19:13.052
So we're at dinner, and of
course, here comes the drinks.

19:13.052 --> 19:14.353
Whose margarita is that?

19:14.353 --> 19:15.154
Eva's.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.256
A margarita gets set
right in front of me,

19:17.256 --> 19:19.792
but I don't want to
bring the party down,

19:19.792 --> 19:21.394
so I just kind of
go with the flow.

19:21.394 --> 19:22.261
No one's going to notice.

19:22.261 --> 19:23.062
It's all good.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.146
I'm a little bit scared.

19:40.146 --> 19:43.049
Everything is so
overwhelming, and I don't want

19:43.049 --> 19:44.183
to bring attention to myself.

19:44.183 --> 19:47.887
This is a Brie's weekend, and
I don't want it to be about me.

19:47.887 --> 19:50.056
I wish that I could take a shot.

19:50.056 --> 19:51.424
I wish I could drink.

19:51.424 --> 19:52.491
No, I'm good.

19:52.491 --> 19:54.160
But I know that I can't.

19:54.160 --> 19:58.931
My problem is I stay at the
bar, I'll close that bar down.

19:58.931 --> 20:01.233
And I'm just really
scared to tell the girls,

20:01.233 --> 20:03.602
because I don't want
them to just think

20:03.602 --> 20:05.838
of me any differently, I guess.

20:11.844 --> 20:12.645
Wow!

20:23.956 --> 20:25.091
What's going on?

20:25.091 --> 20:29.729
I just thought that I could
have one, and then be cool.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.931
I'll find out today if I'm
going to have to have surgery

20:31.931 --> 20:32.732
or not.

20:32.732 --> 20:33.966
This bone here?

20:33.966 --> 20:34.767
That's broken.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.569
I could be out for
a couple of months.

20:50.449 --> 20:51.450
Eva!

20:51.450 --> 20:52.251
Eva!

21:25.518 --> 21:27.787
The girls are continuously
having these shots

21:27.787 --> 21:31.123
and drinking, and my temptation
is at a whole other level.

21:31.123 --> 21:34.994
I have way too much to lose
now than I ever did before,

21:34.994 --> 21:38.597
so the best situation for me
is go home and call it a night.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.147
With Eva?

21:55.147 --> 21:57.750
She just literally got up,
walked away, and I'm like,

21:57.750 --> 21:59.084
what's going on?

21:59.084 --> 22:00.452
She was [BLEEP] gone.

22:00.452 --> 22:01.287
She didn't say anything?

22:01.287 --> 22:02.955
No, she's like, just, I'm
like, do you want me to go

22:02.955 --> 22:03.856
back with you to the house?

22:03.856 --> 22:05.658
It's just awkward,
the way she did that.

22:05.658 --> 22:08.928
We're all having fun,
but Eva got in a cab upset

22:08.928 --> 22:10.496
and went back to the house.

22:10.496 --> 22:13.032
And that kind of just dampers
the mood a little bit.

22:25.377 --> 22:26.712
Is everyone decent?

22:26.712 --> 22:30.950
I was going to come spank
you guys to wake you up.

22:30.950 --> 22:33.018
Let's go down, and
let's get some food.

22:33.018 --> 22:33.886
Yes.

22:33.886 --> 22:36.088
I'm getting everything,
just so you guys know.

22:36.088 --> 22:37.556
Me too.

22:37.556 --> 22:38.824
Do you feel better today?

22:38.824 --> 22:40.426
Um, yeah.

22:40.426 --> 22:42.094
I just needed to, you know--

22:42.094 --> 22:43.596
Yeah, what happened last night?

22:43.596 --> 22:47.733
I just was so tired, and,
um-- just a long day, you know?

22:47.733 --> 22:48.534
Yeah.

22:48.534 --> 22:49.835
No, I feel you.

22:49.835 --> 22:50.870
It was a long day.

22:50.870 --> 22:51.937
Hi, you guys.

22:51.937 --> 22:52.771
Hey.

22:52.771 --> 22:53.572
Good morning.

22:53.572 --> 22:54.940
Can I get a cup of coffee?

22:54.940 --> 22:56.242
Can I get some coffee?

22:56.242 --> 22:57.543
Natty, you have
something on your--

22:57.543 --> 22:58.344
Thank you.

22:58.344 --> 23:01.614
You have something on your lip.

23:01.614 --> 23:02.615
Other side.

23:02.615 --> 23:03.515
Is that a chocolate?

23:03.515 --> 23:06.785
What is it?

23:06.785 --> 23:07.987
Oh my god.

23:07.987 --> 23:08.888
Hold on.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.556
There was nothing else to eat.

23:10.556 --> 23:11.724
Sometimes I just
get a sweet tooth.

23:13.659 --> 23:15.928
I didn't know it
was even on my face.

23:15.928 --> 23:18.063
I was just craving
something, like, chocolatey.

23:18.063 --> 23:20.065
You're like, ooh.

23:20.065 --> 23:20.866
Brie.

23:20.866 --> 23:22.134
Did you eat the whole thing?

23:22.134 --> 23:25.004
Yes.

23:25.004 --> 23:27.106
Oh my god, a whale
jumped out of the water.

23:27.106 --> 23:28.841
So big.

23:28.841 --> 23:29.975
Oh my gosh.

23:29.975 --> 23:31.777
It just jumped out.

23:31.777 --> 23:33.245
That was a big jump.

23:33.245 --> 23:34.847
I need to get some sun.

23:34.847 --> 23:35.648
Yeah.

23:35.648 --> 23:38.317
I need a tan.

23:38.317 --> 23:40.052
Hey.

23:40.052 --> 23:40.853
Thank you.

23:40.853 --> 23:41.720
Thank you.

23:41.720 --> 23:42.521
Salud.

23:42.521 --> 23:45.157
Salud and enjoy.

23:45.157 --> 23:46.125
Round two.

23:48.761 --> 23:49.561
Oh my god.

23:54.967 --> 23:56.135
This is the strawberry one?

23:56.135 --> 23:56.936
Yes, strawberry.

23:59.505 --> 24:00.372
Cheers.

24:03.842 --> 24:05.978
You guys are like,
SU colors right now.

24:05.978 --> 24:06.745
Aw.

24:06.745 --> 24:08.180
Love it.

24:08.180 --> 24:09.248
Oh, it is hot out here.

24:09.248 --> 24:10.049
It got--

24:10.049 --> 24:13.085
We were in the water
for like, two hours.

24:13.085 --> 24:14.954
Yeah, and I'm already
day buzzed again.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.855
Really?

24:16.855 --> 24:17.923
I love getting day buzzed.

24:17.923 --> 24:19.959
We love day buzz.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.593
And we like to
go to bed at 5:00.

24:21.593 --> 24:23.662
Like, just when you're
Cali girls, like--

24:23.662 --> 24:24.797
-Eva.
-Hey, girl.

24:24.797 --> 24:25.898
Look at your little
summer dress.

24:25.898 --> 24:27.199
We were just talking
about Cali girls,

24:27.199 --> 24:28.968
how we're like, day buzz girls.

24:28.968 --> 24:29.768
Eva.

24:31.370 --> 24:32.738
Yeah, what happened
with you last night?

24:32.738 --> 24:33.872
Um, no.

24:33.872 --> 24:35.374
Why'd you leave all quick?

24:35.374 --> 24:36.575
[BLEEP].

24:36.575 --> 24:38.210
We all were in the
van, we're like,

24:38.210 --> 24:40.145
oh, definitely got a
text from Jonathan.

24:40.145 --> 24:41.413
No, me and him are good.

24:41.413 --> 24:42.715
Everything is good with that.

24:42.715 --> 24:43.682
What is it?

24:43.682 --> 24:45.184
Boo, talk to us.

24:45.184 --> 24:47.252
Um-- guess I need
to come clean.

24:47.252 --> 24:52.191
I guess I-- I feel, like,
a little bit out of place.

24:52.191 --> 24:54.426
I can't believe you told
Natty about that [BLEEP].

24:54.426 --> 24:56.095
That's the worst
part about drinking.

24:56.095 --> 24:57.363
Mom doesn't even know.

24:57.363 --> 24:58.163
No one knows.

24:58.163 --> 24:59.198
Like, here Natty knows.

24:59.198 --> 25:01.533
Maybe they won't judge
me for my marriage.

25:01.533 --> 25:02.968
I have to tell
you all something.

25:02.968 --> 25:06.005
I got married when I was 20.

25:06.005 --> 25:06.972
John's gonna be pissed.

25:11.710 --> 25:12.644
What is it?

25:12.644 --> 25:14.079
Boo, talk to us.

25:14.079 --> 25:15.948
Um, guess I need to come clean.

25:15.948 --> 25:17.883
I feel, like, a little
bit out of place.

25:21.620 --> 25:23.088
What's going on?

25:23.088 --> 25:24.990
I'm kind of going through,
like, my own little struggle.

25:24.990 --> 25:26.125
Like, I don't drink.

25:26.125 --> 25:26.925
Oh, gosh.

25:26.925 --> 25:28.660
Sorry, boo.

25:28.660 --> 25:29.561
Girl.

25:29.561 --> 25:32.297
No, but I don't want
it to be like that.

25:32.297 --> 25:34.900
I feel like, oh, man, I'm
like, the party pooper.

25:34.900 --> 25:37.669
I feel so bad even being here,
because it's like, so fun,

25:37.669 --> 25:39.772
and like, social and
amazing, and it's

25:39.772 --> 25:42.541
like, I can't even, like, toast
without feeling, like, weird.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.843
I didn't really think
ahead when we got here.

25:44.843 --> 25:46.945
And then it was just like,
so overwhelming that I was

25:46.945 --> 25:50.082
like, oh my god, like,
I have to face the music

25:50.082 --> 25:51.784
and let you guys know, you know?

25:51.784 --> 25:54.153
You know, a big thing
with me is like, I would--

25:54.153 --> 25:56.221
I got [BLEEP] faced, and I
felt like, I had to get drunk,

25:56.221 --> 25:56.722
I had to get drunk.

25:56.722 --> 25:57.856
But what people
didn't realize is

25:57.856 --> 25:59.758
I was very unhappy in my life.

25:59.758 --> 26:01.860
Do you struggle with
it still, like-- or do

26:01.860 --> 26:03.762
you feel like you're good, or--

26:03.762 --> 26:05.964
I can't lie to myself, because
I've been sober for three

26:05.964 --> 26:06.865
years, and then I relapsed.

26:06.865 --> 26:08.434
I relapsed right
before I got this job.

26:08.434 --> 26:09.334
-Really?
-No way.

26:09.334 --> 26:10.135
Oh my gosh.

26:10.135 --> 26:11.136
What happened?

26:11.136 --> 26:13.672
I just thought that I
could be, like-- well, what

26:13.672 --> 26:15.374
we call it is like, a normie.

26:15.374 --> 26:16.875
So like, I could
go and, you know,

26:16.875 --> 26:17.876
be like a normal human being.

26:17.876 --> 26:20.279
I wish I could, like, just go
and have one, and then be cool.

26:20.279 --> 26:21.580
But I never can have one.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.916
No, Eva, I know exactly
what you're talking about.

26:23.916 --> 26:26.018
Even my dad, you know,
it's stuff that he's

26:26.018 --> 26:27.453
struggled with in the past.

26:27.453 --> 26:30.422
I know what Eva's going
through because I have people

26:30.422 --> 26:32.024
in my family that have
gone through stuff,

26:32.024 --> 26:33.525
and it's a day to day struggle.

26:33.525 --> 26:36.261
It's definitely hit
really close to home.

26:36.261 --> 26:38.130
I can relate to her more
than she even knows.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.165
See, and like, I feel bad for
you, Natty, because you're on,

26:40.165 --> 26:41.066
like, the flip side.

26:41.066 --> 26:43.936
Like, I guarantee you have
no idea, like, how many times

26:43.936 --> 26:47.339
your dad has probably tried
to like, get through it

26:47.339 --> 26:49.007
and be sober for you.

26:49.007 --> 26:49.808
You know?

26:49.808 --> 26:51.143
For my family, like,
it wasn't enough.

26:51.143 --> 26:54.646
Like, seeing my
parents constantly,

26:54.646 --> 26:55.914
like, what is wrong, you know?

26:55.914 --> 27:00.619
Like, why can't you,
like-- constantly

27:00.619 --> 27:01.820
just getting in
trouble, you know?

27:01.820 --> 27:04.756
And like, I love my
family so much, but like,

27:04.756 --> 27:05.958
I couldn't-- I couldn't.

27:05.958 --> 27:08.961
So like, your dad obviously
loves you so much, you know?

27:08.961 --> 27:11.363
So it's like, it has nothing
to do with like, you.

27:11.363 --> 27:12.631
It's just a constant struggle.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.967
I hope to god, like,
being like, a daughter,

27:14.967 --> 27:16.902
that you don't have any
of that, like, oh, I wish

27:16.902 --> 27:18.036
I could do something for him.

27:18.036 --> 27:19.972
Because it's all on that person.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.140
You know what I mean?

27:21.140 --> 27:23.108
For me, especially coming,
like, I'm the youngest girl,

27:23.108 --> 27:24.610
so it's like, so much shame.

27:24.610 --> 27:25.410
You know?

27:25.410 --> 27:27.379
And so it's like, just as
much, like, love that I had

27:27.379 --> 27:29.381
for my family, it was just
something that, you know,

27:29.381 --> 27:30.983
I continued to, like, deal with.

27:30.983 --> 27:35.087
Eva telling us her situation
with alcohol and her past

27:35.087 --> 27:36.555
just creates this bond.

27:36.555 --> 27:39.858
Everyone's kind of opening up
and letting their guard down,

27:39.858 --> 27:41.760
and it's kind of
creating this sisterhood.

27:41.760 --> 27:45.697
Because in the end, we all have
something that we've done wrong

27:45.697 --> 27:47.599
in the past, or there's
something in our life

27:47.599 --> 27:49.034
that just isn't perfect.

27:49.034 --> 27:50.802
I want to say, like,
thank you to you guys,

27:50.802 --> 27:52.871
because I feel
you guys have been

27:52.871 --> 27:56.175
in the public eye for a while
now, so it's like, that's hard.

27:56.175 --> 27:59.144
And that's what's awesome
about being a Diva,

27:59.144 --> 28:02.247
is that, you know, you can
actually be a role model,

28:02.247 --> 28:04.917
because each person can
relate to one of us somehow.

28:04.917 --> 28:06.685
You know, cause everyone's
story is so, so different.

28:06.685 --> 28:07.486
Yeah.

28:07.486 --> 28:08.954
I think your story
is really powerful,

28:08.954 --> 28:11.123
and I think that you
may not want to do it,

28:11.123 --> 28:12.991
but you might be a
great spokesperson

28:12.991 --> 28:14.560
for somebody that-- because--

28:14.560 --> 28:15.460
Change a lot of lives.

28:15.460 --> 28:16.495
Yeah, it's one thing
to talk about it,

28:16.495 --> 28:18.263
but it's another thing to
have been there, and to go,

28:18.263 --> 28:19.164
you know what?

28:19.164 --> 28:20.532
I went through this.

28:20.532 --> 28:21.767
You know what they feel.

28:21.767 --> 28:23.502
It's just like,
sometimes it's OK to cry,

28:23.502 --> 28:25.938
it's OK to melt down, it's
OK to walk out of a club,

28:25.938 --> 28:27.739
or it's OK to be real.

28:27.739 --> 28:29.708
At least you're, like,
changing your life,

28:29.708 --> 28:32.444
and, you know, like, being a
positive role model for others.

28:32.444 --> 28:33.712
And at least we're
talking about this.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.080
And it's like no,
actually, there

28:35.080 --> 28:39.017
is [BLEEP] that goes on behind
even the most beautiful human.

28:39.017 --> 28:41.286
They are so sweet
to me, and it makes

28:41.286 --> 28:44.389
me feel so good,
because at that moment

28:44.389 --> 28:46.091
they're not judging me at all.

28:46.091 --> 28:49.261
And they're just making
me feel OK with the issue

28:49.261 --> 28:50.495
that I struggle with.

28:50.495 --> 28:54.866
What's amazing is that me being
honest and telling the truth

28:54.866 --> 28:56.902
just got us all
closer, because were

28:56.902 --> 29:01.440
able to come together on this,
like, pretty emotional topic.

29:01.440 --> 29:05.277
And it's one of those bonds
that we'll always now.

29:05.277 --> 29:06.645
We love you for who you are.

29:06.645 --> 29:07.846
Dude, you're a bad ass chick.

29:07.846 --> 29:09.781
You're [BLEEP] awesome.

29:09.781 --> 29:10.582
Everything, girl.

29:10.582 --> 29:11.617
Bitch, you better work.

29:11.617 --> 29:12.551
Mean girls.

29:12.551 --> 29:15.320
So you don't ever have
to pretend to be anything.

29:15.320 --> 29:16.989
Just be who you are,
because honestly, you're

29:16.989 --> 29:18.590
a [BLEEP] cool ass chick.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.359
Please don't feel
like, you know,

29:20.359 --> 29:22.427
the rest of the day, or
anything, the rest of the trip,

29:22.427 --> 29:25.397
like-- you all-- drink,
toast, shots, cool.

29:25.397 --> 29:26.198
Like, I'm good.

29:26.198 --> 29:27.499
I'm OK to be around it.

29:27.499 --> 29:29.234
I just needed to like, come
clean with where I'm at.

29:29.234 --> 29:30.035
Fine.

29:30.035 --> 29:30.969
If you insist.

29:30.969 --> 29:33.972
Fettuccine, can we
have those dacquiris?

29:33.972 --> 29:36.475
Aw.

29:36.475 --> 29:37.542
Thank you so much.

29:37.542 --> 29:39.544
And a strawberry.

29:39.544 --> 29:40.345
Cabo!

29:46.752 --> 29:48.387
All right, so
how are you doing?

29:48.387 --> 29:49.187
About the same.

29:49.187 --> 29:50.689
Yeah?

29:50.689 --> 29:52.024
I'm here at the
doctor's office today

29:52.024 --> 29:54.026
to get another
examination on my eye.

29:54.026 --> 29:56.395
There's still a few
problems with my eye,

29:56.395 --> 29:59.998
and the motion of it,
and I am beyond nervous.

29:59.998 --> 30:03.035
I'm worrying myself to
death, but the swelling

30:03.035 --> 30:07.072
has went down almost
100%, and I don't have

30:07.072 --> 30:08.607
to wear that eye patch anymore.

30:08.607 --> 30:11.009
This is what we worry
about with what you had,

30:11.009 --> 30:12.144
the eye sinking in.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.613
You've got a little fat
that's sort of caught

30:14.613 --> 30:16.915
in that fracture, and that's
why when you look to the right,

30:16.915 --> 30:18.617
it hurts a little bit.

30:18.617 --> 30:22.921
What you got, this wall here,
this bone here, that's broken.

30:22.921 --> 30:23.722
All right?

30:23.722 --> 30:25.457
And you've got a bunch
of fat and muscle

30:25.457 --> 30:26.792
that's sitting around the eye.

30:26.792 --> 30:28.960
I'm still having a lot
of pain with my eye,

30:28.960 --> 30:30.962
and the doctor
explains to me why.

30:30.962 --> 30:33.965
But this could mean I
could be out for a couple

30:33.965 --> 30:36.968
of months, which I'm
not trying to hear that.

30:36.968 --> 30:39.938
Your movements are full, you
have no double vision, OK?

30:39.938 --> 30:41.740
You're moving the
eye around properly.

30:41.740 --> 30:43.675
It's not sinking in,
and I think there's

30:43.675 --> 30:44.910
a reasonable chance
we're not gonna

30:44.910 --> 30:46.678
have to do anything to you.

30:46.678 --> 30:47.879
OK.

30:47.879 --> 30:50.415
So if everything is
fine, and it's just

30:50.415 --> 30:52.551
needing to let it finally
heal, how much time

30:52.551 --> 30:54.419
am I looking at to be out?

30:54.419 --> 30:56.755
Let's give it a good two,
three weeks just to scar in,

30:56.755 --> 30:57.889
and then you should be OK.

30:57.889 --> 30:59.091
-Cool.
-Yep.

30:59.091 --> 31:00.058
All right.

31:00.058 --> 31:01.460
That's such a relief.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.995
Having surgery would have had
me out at least two months.

31:03.995 --> 31:06.732
Now I can get back
to work sooner.

31:06.732 --> 31:08.066
All right, jerk,
so you heard him.

31:08.066 --> 31:10.369
He said three weeks.

31:10.369 --> 31:11.336
I could be back in the ring.

31:11.336 --> 31:13.505
He didn't say three weeks
you'd be back in the ring.

31:13.505 --> 31:14.940
He said three weeks.

31:14.940 --> 31:17.309
This could be my big shot to
have a big moment in Mania

31:17.309 --> 31:18.110
this year.

31:18.110 --> 31:19.378
All he said was
just to take it easy,

31:19.378 --> 31:21.480
or you ain't gonna see
no damn Mania at all.

31:27.285 --> 31:29.254
Thank you.

31:29.254 --> 31:30.455
Alfredo's the best.

31:30.455 --> 31:31.256
The best.

31:31.256 --> 31:34.693
He's seriously the
best bartender ever.

31:34.693 --> 31:35.494
He's amazing.

31:35.494 --> 31:36.862
Yeah.

31:36.862 --> 31:40.599
Hey, I wanted to talk to you.

31:40.599 --> 31:43.835
I can't believe you told
Natty about [BLEEP].

31:43.835 --> 31:45.971
That's the worst
part about drinking.

31:45.971 --> 31:47.773
Nicole.

31:47.773 --> 31:49.474
Natty's one of my good
friends, but she's--

31:49.474 --> 31:50.342
Yeah, but Natty
has a big mouth.

31:50.342 --> 31:52.010
And I hate saying that,
because I love Natty to death.

31:52.010 --> 31:53.311
Don't.
It's been giving me anxiety.

31:53.311 --> 31:56.715
Like, because we have not
talked about this for years.

31:56.715 --> 31:58.216
John doesn't even know.

31:58.216 --> 31:59.317
Mom doesn't even know.

31:59.317 --> 32:00.185
No one knows.

32:00.185 --> 32:01.653
And like, here Natty knows.

32:01.653 --> 32:04.189
Not even our brother.

32:04.189 --> 32:08.059
I'm hoping Natty doesn't
tell anyone about my marriage,

32:08.059 --> 32:09.561
but I can't trust that.

32:09.561 --> 32:13.165
So I honestly just need to woman
up and tell my family first,

32:13.165 --> 32:16.401
and then I might tell John.

32:16.401 --> 32:18.036
Now it's gonna be like,
oh, why do you care

32:18.036 --> 32:19.004
about ever getting married?

32:19.004 --> 32:19.805
You already did it.

32:19.805 --> 32:23.809
But honestly, Nicole, you
do have to think about that.

32:23.809 --> 32:25.677
I mean, it's kind
of nerve wracking,

32:25.677 --> 32:30.949
but Eva being honest about
her past kind of makes me feel

32:30.949 --> 32:32.884
like maybe I need to be honest.

32:32.884 --> 32:36.054
Because in the end, my family
has unconditional love for me.

32:36.054 --> 32:38.089
Maybe they won't judge
me for my marriage.

32:40.692 --> 32:42.327
I got married when I was 20.

32:42.327 --> 32:43.128
These things happen.

32:43.128 --> 32:44.529
They really don't just happen.

32:44.529 --> 32:46.298
You don't just run off
and get married, and not

32:46.298 --> 32:47.299
tell your family for 10 years.

32:47.299 --> 32:48.633
That doesn't just happen.

32:55.841 --> 32:57.909
Yay, I'm happy we're
venturing out during the day.

32:57.909 --> 32:58.710
Right?

32:58.710 --> 33:00.145
Me too.

33:00.145 --> 33:00.946
All right.

33:00.946 --> 33:01.746
Are we going in?

33:01.746 --> 33:04.115
Yeah.

33:04.115 --> 33:05.984
Everybody has
finally lightened up

33:05.984 --> 33:08.153
and decided to do one
of my ideas, which was

33:08.153 --> 33:09.855
swimming with rescued dolphins.

33:09.855 --> 33:11.857
So where are your
dolphins from?

33:11.857 --> 33:14.993
You know, there's some of us,
like, we feel bad, like, seeing

33:14.993 --> 33:16.528
the dolphins caged.

33:16.528 --> 33:20.265
Like, 10 years ago, there was
like, a hurricane [INAUDIBLE]

33:20.265 --> 33:22.534
from here, and these
dolphins, like,

33:22.534 --> 33:25.470
five dolphins were on the shore,
and the Mexican government

33:25.470 --> 33:26.404
rescued them.

33:26.404 --> 33:27.706
Believe me, they are
really happy here.

33:27.706 --> 33:28.507
OK?

33:28.507 --> 33:32.043
Senoritas, let me say,
all right, these dolphins,

33:32.043 --> 33:33.345
they love French kisses.

33:33.345 --> 33:34.312
All right?

33:38.717 --> 33:39.684
Oh my god.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.532
I am so glad that
everybody's having fun.

33:59.771 --> 34:00.672
Aw.

34:00.672 --> 34:02.007
See, isn't this fun?

34:02.007 --> 34:03.141
Like, we don't have to drink.

34:03.141 --> 34:07.512
We're just all sober,
riding dolphins.

34:07.512 --> 34:09.147
Even though you and
I are out here, and--

34:09.147 --> 34:09.947
Yeah, I know, right?

34:09.947 --> 34:12.617
But like, it's fun to see
everyone, like, having a blast.

34:12.617 --> 34:13.952
I think this is like,
the happiest I've

34:13.952 --> 34:15.954
seen everyone the whole trip.

34:15.954 --> 34:16.788
I agree.

34:16.788 --> 34:18.956
And no drinks involved.

34:18.956 --> 34:22.393
At the end of the
day, this trip,

34:22.393 --> 34:25.530
not only did it bring us
together because we're all here

34:25.530 --> 34:29.034
to celebrate Brie's
wedding, but all of us

34:29.034 --> 34:32.203
connected on such another level
that we never thought possible.

34:32.203 --> 34:34.539
So I'm just stoked
to see how far

34:34.539 --> 34:36.841
my relationship with each
and every one of these girls

34:36.841 --> 34:37.976
has blossomed.

34:37.976 --> 34:40.245
I'm so happy I did that.

34:40.245 --> 34:41.045
That was worth it.

34:41.045 --> 34:43.181
Oh my god, yes.

34:43.181 --> 34:43.982
Well done, Natty.

34:43.982 --> 34:44.783
Thanks.

34:44.783 --> 34:46.518
That's all I wanted, was
just a little of this.

34:46.518 --> 34:47.851
Shockingly well done.

34:47.851 --> 34:49.219
Yeah.

34:49.219 --> 34:50.221
A little this, and a little--

35:00.365 --> 35:01.166
Cheers.

35:01.166 --> 35:03.602
Cheers to a great weekend.

35:03.602 --> 35:06.071
Yay.

35:06.071 --> 35:07.772
The next time we'll
all be together

35:07.772 --> 35:08.740
will be at the wedding.

35:08.740 --> 35:09.641
Yes.

35:09.641 --> 35:11.343
Oh my gosh, that's right.

35:11.343 --> 35:13.511
So it's our last night in Cabo.

35:13.511 --> 35:16.247
We're all by the fire pit,
just enjoying the weather,

35:16.247 --> 35:17.349
hearing the ocean.

35:17.349 --> 35:20.018
It's just such a
beautiful night.

35:20.018 --> 35:21.186
Aw, sister.

35:21.186 --> 35:25.523
How did that feel, to
have, like, your twin going

35:25.523 --> 35:27.993
to be now legit husband that--

35:31.997 --> 35:32.797
Yeah.

35:32.797 --> 35:33.898
I think so.

35:33.898 --> 35:35.500
Yeah, like six months.

35:35.500 --> 35:36.735
No.

35:36.735 --> 35:38.703
I know John so well.

35:38.703 --> 35:40.538
There's no way he's
going to be asking.

35:40.538 --> 35:42.340
And of course I want
to get married soon,

35:42.340 --> 35:43.975
but I just hope
this little secret

35:43.975 --> 35:47.178
that I've had for the past 10
years doesn't ruin any of that.

35:47.178 --> 35:49.681
Would you be content, though,
if you guys-- if he decided

35:49.681 --> 35:51.416
to say, like, you know, I
don't want to get married,

35:51.416 --> 35:53.018
but I want to have kids?

35:53.018 --> 35:55.220
I mean, probably in the
end, yeah, I would be,

35:55.220 --> 35:57.188
but it would be--
it'd still be hard.

35:57.188 --> 35:59.858
Because like, I mean, you
know, some of you guys

35:59.858 --> 36:01.493
know, like, to take
your man's name, like,

36:01.493 --> 36:03.528
that's what sometimes
he doesn't understand.

36:03.528 --> 36:04.863
Like, that's a big deal.

36:10.301 --> 36:11.770
I mean, I'd probably
end up doing it,

36:11.770 --> 36:17.075
but-- because I can't-- I
won't ever find love like that.

36:17.075 --> 36:19.644
OK, you guys, I guess
since it's our last night,

36:19.644 --> 36:22.147
and its Brie's
bachelorette, maybe we

36:22.147 --> 36:24.983
could all go around and
say something sweet,

36:24.983 --> 36:27.886
and make her feel
a little special.

36:27.886 --> 36:29.554
Natty.

36:29.554 --> 36:31.589
Brie, you just have
a heard of gold.

36:31.589 --> 36:36.861
And it's not that Nicole doesn't
have a heart of gold, but you--

36:36.861 --> 36:39.164
Because mine's made
out of diamonds.

36:39.164 --> 36:40.298
Nicole's is rimmed
with diamonds.

36:40.298 --> 36:41.866
Platinum, bitch.

36:41.866 --> 36:44.502
No, but we started
out in WWE together.

36:44.502 --> 36:47.372
I remember everybody thinking
you guys were just these,

36:47.372 --> 36:49.741
you know, twins
that were models.

36:49.741 --> 36:52.577
And you guys have been proving
people wrong ever since,

36:52.577 --> 36:54.579
and I think that you bring
out the best in Brian,

36:54.579 --> 36:56.181
and Brian brings
out the best in you.

36:56.181 --> 36:59.150
He's your match made in heaven.

36:59.150 --> 37:01.152
That was sweet.

37:01.152 --> 37:02.487
Looking at you
and Brian, you guys

37:02.487 --> 37:05.123
are like, so freaking cute,
and I couldn't be happier.

37:05.123 --> 37:06.758
You guys are like
a genuine couple.

37:06.758 --> 37:08.193
I see you guys,
I'm just like, wow,

37:08.193 --> 37:09.327
they were really meant to be.

37:09.327 --> 37:12.230
And I'm so glad I'm able to
like, call you guys my friends.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.398
I wish you guys the best.

37:13.398 --> 37:14.999
I know that day's going
to be super special,

37:14.999 --> 37:17.502
and I'm gonna be so happy
to share that day with you.

37:17.502 --> 37:18.303
Girl.

37:18.303 --> 37:22.507
I'm really happy that I'm
here, and I am really enjoying

37:22.507 --> 37:24.275
becoming closer with you both.

37:24.275 --> 37:26.144
And I'm just happy
that you kind of

37:26.144 --> 37:28.913
helped me out in a lot of ways,
that you don't even realize it.

37:28.913 --> 37:31.583
So I appreciate you guys
very much, both of you.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.251
Having Eva at my
bachelorette party

37:33.251 --> 37:35.253
actually means a
lot, because I just

37:35.253 --> 37:37.388
keep seeing this
great side to her,

37:37.388 --> 37:39.124
and just see her
heart keep growing.

37:39.124 --> 37:41.159
You kind of just can't
judge a book by its cover.

37:41.159 --> 37:42.894
You just gotta kind
of let the book open,

37:42.894 --> 37:44.662
and see who that
person's really about.

37:44.662 --> 37:46.464
And I'm seeing that with Eva.

37:46.464 --> 37:48.800
There's a lot of
memories, obviously,

37:48.800 --> 37:52.604
but I'm extremely,
just so happy for you

37:52.604 --> 37:55.907
that you're getting married, and
you met the man of your dreams,

37:55.907 --> 38:00.044
and I have a brother-in-law,
and he's amazing and gives

38:00.044 --> 38:02.347
me a hard time, and I love it.

38:02.347 --> 38:06.851
And I'm just excited to
be a part of the last fun

38:06.851 --> 38:08.353
before the wedding.

38:08.353 --> 38:13.124
Everyone's words are
so sincere and sweet,

38:13.124 --> 38:14.559
and you could really
tell that everyone's

38:14.559 --> 38:15.727
speaking from the heart.

38:15.727 --> 38:17.962
The biggest thing for me
is knowing that the day

38:17.962 --> 38:21.666
that wedding comes, it means the
next chapter of my life starts.

38:21.666 --> 38:25.770
And that means being a
misses, and maybe a mother.

38:25.770 --> 38:27.639
My, like, cheeks are hurting
right now, because like,

38:27.639 --> 38:28.473
I can't stop smiling.

38:28.473 --> 38:29.974
Like, I feel like
I'm on cloud nine.

38:29.974 --> 38:31.276
So thank you so much for coming.

38:31.276 --> 38:32.076
Yes.

38:32.076 --> 38:32.911
Cheers.

38:32.911 --> 38:34.145
Couldn't have been a better--

38:34.145 --> 38:36.781
Nobody burn yourself.

38:36.781 --> 38:37.949
Cheers!

38:37.949 --> 38:38.750
Woo!

38:55.500 --> 38:58.203
So right here, go straight.

38:58.203 --> 38:59.771
Look at the Rolls Royce.

38:59.771 --> 39:00.705
Yeah.

39:00.705 --> 39:02.507
Love that.

39:02.507 --> 39:04.409
So I'm so excited
for you see the house.

39:04.409 --> 39:05.643
I am, too.

39:05.643 --> 39:09.113
My mom and I are on our way
to my brother's new house,

39:09.113 --> 39:10.682
and all my family is
going to be there,

39:10.682 --> 39:14.519
so I feel it's the perfect
time to tell them my secret.

39:14.519 --> 39:16.254
Aw.

39:16.254 --> 39:17.856
Lauren.

39:17.856 --> 39:18.923
A little bit.

39:18.923 --> 39:21.025
Oh my goodness, co cute.

39:21.025 --> 39:21.826
Dad.

39:21.826 --> 39:23.027
Hey, how you doing, Nicole?

39:23.027 --> 39:23.828
Good, how are you?

39:23.828 --> 39:24.629
Good.

39:24.629 --> 39:26.164
Good.

39:26.164 --> 39:27.732
Yeah, good to see you.

39:27.732 --> 39:28.833
Hey, babe.

39:28.833 --> 39:31.703
Aw, how are you?

39:31.703 --> 39:32.503
I like it.

39:32.503 --> 39:34.305
I recognize it from the photos.

39:34.305 --> 39:36.875
So everything was
like, beige, and--

39:36.875 --> 39:38.877
Lucy, you remember me.

39:38.877 --> 39:40.144
Aw.

39:40.144 --> 39:41.546
It's OK.

39:41.546 --> 39:43.281
Future baby room.

39:43.281 --> 39:45.383
Aw.

39:45.383 --> 39:46.384
Future babies.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.352
Yeah.

39:47.352 --> 39:49.087
Isn't it crazy
to own a home now?

39:49.087 --> 39:50.255
Yes.

39:50.255 --> 39:52.090
It's comfortable, though.

39:52.090 --> 39:54.192
I have to tell
you all something.

39:54.192 --> 39:57.962
I am so nervous right now, and
scared, because I don't know

39:57.962 --> 39:59.097
how they're going to react.

39:59.097 --> 40:00.064
I'm freaking out.

40:00.064 --> 40:01.599
I don't know if I'm
making the right decision.

40:01.599 --> 40:03.968
I'm just praying they're
not gonna be mad.

40:03.968 --> 40:05.103
Please don't be mad.

40:17.849 --> 40:19.050
I have to tell
you all something.

40:24.188 --> 40:27.091
I'm definitely very nervous
to tell my family now.

40:27.091 --> 40:29.594
Everyone in their life has had
that situation where you make

40:29.594 --> 40:31.963
a mistake, and you get
over it, you grow from it,

40:31.963 --> 40:32.997
and you move on.

40:32.997 --> 40:34.999
And when you move on, you never
want to bring it up again.

40:34.999 --> 40:36.501
So I have to tell you
guys something that I've

40:36.501 --> 40:39.337
been hiding for a long time.

40:39.337 --> 40:41.973
Like, 10 years.

40:41.973 --> 40:43.308
Is it good or bad?

40:43.308 --> 40:47.712
My thing is what
I need to say is--

40:47.712 --> 40:49.647
[BARKING]

40:55.486 --> 40:56.487
Enough.

40:56.487 --> 40:57.288
Josie.

40:57.288 --> 40:58.089
Hey, do you understand?

40:58.089 --> 40:58.890
Josie.

40:58.890 --> 41:00.391
Excuse me.

41:00.391 --> 41:02.961
All right.

41:02.961 --> 41:04.095
Stay.

41:04.095 --> 41:06.464
Brie, you had a good entrance.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.099
Why?

41:08.099 --> 41:12.837
Um, I got married
when I was 20.

41:12.837 --> 41:14.739
And got divorced at 23.

41:14.739 --> 41:16.374
You did not.

41:16.374 --> 41:17.942
To my high school sweetheart.

41:17.942 --> 41:19.610
Basically, we got
married by Elvis.

41:19.610 --> 41:23.381
We drove to Vegas,
did it, and even

41:23.381 --> 41:24.649
when I started to
walk down the aisle,

41:24.649 --> 41:26.951
I knew, this is a huge mistake,
how can I get out of it?

41:26.951 --> 41:28.052
And I couldn't.

41:28.052 --> 41:29.887
And I tried to forget
about it, and now it's

41:29.887 --> 41:31.322
starting to come
up, and I figured

41:31.322 --> 41:32.824
you guys had to hear
it from me before you

41:32.824 --> 41:35.293
hear from anyone else.

41:35.293 --> 41:37.495
With our relationship, I
can't imagine that you didn't

41:37.495 --> 41:38.629
think you could come to me.

41:38.629 --> 41:42.000
I don't know if it was
because I was ashamed, or--

41:42.000 --> 41:43.368
You were married for two years?

41:43.368 --> 41:44.168
Almost three.

41:44.168 --> 41:44.969
Oh, wow.

41:44.969 --> 41:46.704
It's crazy, because
John doesn't even now,

41:46.704 --> 41:49.674
and here we talk about
marriage, and I never--

41:49.674 --> 41:53.011
John's gonna be pissed.

41:53.011 --> 41:56.114
I mean, I'd be pissed for
him if you hadn't told him.

41:56.114 --> 41:56.914
Well, I know.

41:56.914 --> 41:58.082
That's what I'm afraid of.

41:58.082 --> 42:00.284
Because you talk about
marriage all the time with him.

42:00.284 --> 42:03.755
I mean, don't expect
it to be easy.

42:03.755 --> 42:05.590
You know, these
things happen, man,

42:05.590 --> 42:07.025
and you just gotta
be there for her.

42:07.025 --> 42:08.659
But they really
don't just happen.

42:08.659 --> 42:09.660
No, they don't.

42:09.660 --> 42:10.595
Yeah, well you--

42:10.595 --> 42:12.730
You don't just run off
and get married, and not

42:12.730 --> 42:13.765
tell your family for 10 years.

42:13.765 --> 42:15.166
That doesn't just happen.

42:15.166 --> 42:15.967
It's out now.

42:15.967 --> 42:18.269
It just needs to be forgotten,
and we all move forward.

42:18.269 --> 42:19.637
I don't know, I just--
I just don't even

42:19.637 --> 42:20.705
really want to be a part of it.

42:20.705 --> 42:24.142
Like, you do what you gotta
do, and I hope you figure

42:24.142 --> 42:27.712
it all out with, uh, John.

42:27.712 --> 42:31.416
Maybe I should head out,
because-- I'm freaking out.

42:31.416 --> 42:32.817
If my brother's going
to get that upset,

42:32.817 --> 42:34.118
how is John going to feel?

42:34.118 --> 42:35.520
I'm speechless right now.

42:35.520 --> 42:37.188
He's obviously upset.

42:37.188 --> 42:39.824
It's OK.

42:39.824 --> 42:40.792
Sorry for lying.

42:48.533 --> 42:52.904
NARRATOR: Next on the two part
season finale of Total Divas.

42:52.904 --> 42:54.372
This is the
biggest Wrestlemania

42:54.372 --> 42:56.274
in the history of WWE.

42:56.274 --> 43:00.078
You are competing against--

43:00.078 --> 43:01.245
You can be the
new Divas champion.

43:01.245 --> 43:02.680
I don't know.

43:02.680 --> 43:03.681
This is insane.

43:03.681 --> 43:06.617
ANNOUNCER: This is Wrestlemania!

43:06.617 --> 43:09.120
Summer's disrespected
Brie so many times.

43:09.120 --> 43:11.089
I just don't want
you at my wedding.

43:11.089 --> 43:12.623
None of the other
girls like me.

43:12.623 --> 43:13.691
You're a selfish bitch.

43:13.691 --> 43:15.293
I feel like you're
being unreasonable.

43:15.293 --> 43:17.495
This is, like, once
in a lifetime thing.

43:17.495 --> 43:21.499
Do you want us to spend
$120,000 on a wedding?

43:21.499 --> 43:23.868
I promised Brie I'd tell
John about my marriage

43:23.868 --> 43:25.336
before the wedding.

43:25.336 --> 43:27.605
I just can't get the words out.

43:27.605 --> 43:29.674
For her to tell you that
she's been married before,

43:29.674 --> 43:31.242
you're handling
everything awesome.

43:31.242 --> 43:34.479
Why would you go say
something to him about that?
