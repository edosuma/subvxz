00:06.883 --> 00:08.685
The trial starts tomorrow.

00:08.685 --> 00:12.207
I can bring you up to speed on it.
The facts are straightforward.

00:12.207 --> 00:13.774
And why can't Tara do it?

00:13.774 --> 00:15.994
Well, Tara's a junior associate.

00:15.994 --> 00:18.698
This trial's gonna be in the news.
It's hardly the kind of case that…

00:18.698 --> 00:23.248
Brad, it isn't the case 
so much as it is the client, right?

00:23.391 --> 00:27.261
And it isn't who she is
so much as what she is, right?

00:28.630 --> 00:30.967
What is she, Brad?

00:31.647 --> 00:33.434
Can't you even say the word?

00:33.434 --> 00:35.834
–I can say it.
–Well, what is she, Brad?

00:37.338 --> 00:39.418
She's a…

00:39.418 --> 00:40.860
homosexual.

00:40.860 --> 00:44.423
And what's the word
for a female homosexual?

00:44.423 --> 00:45.841
–Lesbian.
–I couldn't really hear that.

00:45.841 --> 00:47.119
She's a lesbian!

00:48.391 --> 00:50.686
You don't want to do the case
because your client's a lesbian.

00:50.686 --> 00:52.776
Lori, this is a high-profile case.

00:52.776 --> 00:56.859
I have worked my entire life to associate 
with decency and what is good for America.

00:56.859 --> 00:58.370
And lesbians are bad for America.

00:58.370 --> 00:59.778
They have bad values.

00:59.778 --> 01:01.241
Reflects poorly on all of us.

01:01.241 --> 01:03.293
As a nation.

01:05.756 --> 01:08.843
Now, would you like to 
tell me the real reason?

01:14.586 --> 01:15.398
What do you mean?

01:15.398 --> 01:18.534
I know for a fact you've
represented gay clients before.

01:18.534 --> 01:20.335
Not on television, not in the news.

01:20.335 --> 01:22.391
Brad, we're friends.

01:22.391 --> 01:24.238
Level with me.

01:24.238 --> 01:27.226
What is it about this 
particular lesbian?

01:30.769 --> 01:33.093
I'm attracted to her.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON ABC: 2005/01/23

02:08.310 --> 02:11.136
Why does Shirley get
to skip the staff meetings?

02:11.136 --> 02:15.123
She's got a trial in New York later 
this week, so she has a busy day.

02:15.123 --> 02:17.183
Some of us have trials today,

02:17.183 --> 02:18.400
so if you don't mind,
I'd like to cut out.

02:18.400 --> 02:21.276
What's your case about, Brad?

02:23.424 --> 02:26.326
What is it about?

02:27.913 --> 02:31.069
It involves interference
with contractual relations.

02:31.069 --> 02:32.757
You mean…

02:32.757 --> 02:35.443
lesbians.

02:35.899 --> 02:37.864
Where are you?

02:37.864 --> 02:40.693
Today they're calling Tracey to 
testify that her ex-lover was…

02:40.693 --> 02:43.257
lesbian ex-lover.

02:43.257 --> 02:46.031
To testify that Tracey was
scamming her for money.

02:46.031 --> 02:50.308
Tracey was, in fact,
not an actual bona fide…

02:50.308 --> 02:51.767
lesbian?

02:51.767 --> 02:53.226
–You like saying it.
–I do.

02:53.226 --> 02:54.357
–Say it again.
–Lesbian.

02:54.357 --> 02:58.436
–Keep going.
–Lesbian, lesbian…

02:58.662 --> 03:00.298
lesbian.

03:00.298 --> 03:01.641
All together now.

03:01.641 --> 03:03.046
Lesbian.

03:03.046 --> 03:04.722
I also like to watch.
How many people are lesbian?

03:04.722 --> 03:07.114
All right, that's enough.
This is a staff meeting.

03:07.114 --> 03:11.771
I'll ask you all to conduct yourselves
appropriately and professionally.

03:11.771 --> 03:13.800
Cookies, everyone.

03:13.800 --> 03:16.342
Nourishment is most important
in the morning.

03:16.342 --> 03:18.547
–Who is this woman?
–Take two, Tara.

03:18.547 --> 03:20.845
–You're a rail.
–Who is this woman?

03:20.845 --> 03:22.941
The ones on the left have a little bran

03:22.941 --> 03:25.414
to help our older lawyers
with their routine.

03:25.414 --> 03:27.702
Who is this woman?

03:27.702 --> 03:30.946
I'm Catherine Piper.
I'm Alan's new assistant.

03:30.946 --> 03:33.193
My, don't you have an interesting face.

03:33.193 --> 03:35.323
We are in the middle of a staff meeting.

03:35.323 --> 03:37.310
No need to be snippy, dear,

03:37.310 --> 03:39.648
especially since
I come bearing treats.

03:39.648 --> 03:43.313
You never get a second chance
to make a first impression.

03:43.313 --> 03:45.239
You certainly make one…

03:45.239 --> 03:46.643
with all that bleach.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.988
Ma'am, you will have to leave.

03:48.988 --> 03:52.016
I'm beginning to not like you.

03:52.016 --> 03:55.060
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have a trial myself.

03:55.312 --> 03:56.829
You have a trial?

03:56.829 --> 03:58.185
Yes, tomorrow morning.

03:58.185 --> 04:01.229
–I've got to go meet with my client.
–What kind of trial?

04:01.229 --> 04:03.015
Criminal.

04:03.015 --> 04:06.646
It's a doctor who did…

04:06.646 --> 04:09.321
something against the law.

04:10.378 --> 04:13.000
Who else is with you
on this trial?

04:13.000 --> 04:15.882
Nobody. I decided to fly solo.

04:15.882 --> 04:17.632
Think about that.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.332
Tell Shirley.

04:19.332 --> 04:23.038
Denny Crane without a co-pilot.

04:28.615 --> 04:30.797
Dear God in heaven.

04:41.793 --> 04:42.924
Shirley.

04:42.924 --> 04:45.033
–Alan.
–You're in the men's room again.

04:45.033 --> 04:45.995
I need a favor.

04:45.995 --> 04:47.836
Certainly. My stall or yours?

04:47.836 --> 04:49.345
Driving into work this morning,

04:49.345 --> 04:52.795
I heard of a trial involving
this new wonder diet drug.

04:52.795 --> 04:55.724
The drug, and accordingly the trial,
are making the news,

04:55.724 --> 04:57.963
and then I heard something 
very disturbing.

04:57.963 --> 05:00.293
The name of the lawyer
handling the defense.

05:00.293 --> 05:04.043
Denny Crane. –Nobody wants 
this firm held up to ridicule.

05:04.043 --> 05:07.369
Nobody wants Denny exposed.

05:07.369 --> 05:08.712
I've been in court with Denny.

05:08.712 --> 05:11.845
He knows what he's doing
at least 50% of the time.

05:11.845 --> 05:14.029
I like him, you like him.

05:14.029 --> 05:16.261
I have to be in New York.

05:18.469 --> 05:21.618
If she tries to pee standing up,
come and get me.

05:27.796 --> 05:29.628
Lock and load.

05:37.469 --> 05:39.811
Tracey, we can still
make this go away.

05:39.811 --> 05:42.056
How many times must 
you both say that?

05:42.056 --> 05:43.251
Until you consider it.

05:43.251 --> 05:45.862
Are you sure you want your personal 
life probed with details at 11:00?

05:45.862 --> 05:47.207
I didn't steal from her,

05:47.207 --> 05:50.156
and I won't offer her
anything to settle.

05:50.156 --> 05:52.010
I'd appreciate you
being on my side.

05:52.010 --> 05:54.236
–Hey, we're on your side.
–All right.

05:56.262 --> 05:59.352
We met at an AIDS fundraiser
about two years ago.

05:59.352 --> 06:02.914
We were both publicists,
so we had a lot in common.

06:02.914 --> 06:06.430
And at some point, Ms Rogers,
you and the defendant became lovers?

06:06.430 --> 06:08.899
Yes. She moved into my home.

06:08.899 --> 06:12.135
Ultimately, we became business partners
and formed Rogers and Green,

06:12.135 --> 06:15.307
which became one of the top 
P.R. firms in Boston.

06:15.307 --> 06:16.305
And what happened?

06:16.305 --> 06:20.101
Well, quite simply, after she gained
access to my files and my clients,

06:20.101 --> 06:21.836
–she stole them.
–Objection.

06:21.836 --> 06:22.988
Sustained.

06:22.988 --> 06:26.833
I since learned that she's not even gay,
that she basically pretended to be

06:26.833 --> 06:29.699
so that she could gain access
to my client roster.

06:29.699 --> 06:32.920
Now, Ms Rogers, when you allege
that the defendant pretended to be gay…

06:32.920 --> 06:36.025
She had boyfriends 
before me and one after.

06:36.025 --> 06:39.183
Perhaps that makes her bisexual.
It doesn't make any difference,

06:39.183 --> 06:42.955
because I specifically asked her that
at the beginning of our relationship.

06:42.955 --> 06:45.203
–Whether she was bisexual.
–Yes.

06:45.203 --> 06:48.430
I'd been hurt before by 
heterosexual women experimenting,

06:48.430 --> 06:51.150
and I didn't want to 
go down that road again.

06:51.150 --> 06:53.206
She told me she was gay.

06:53.206 --> 06:57.413
That was a lie, one that 
cost me valuable clients.

06:57.413 --> 06:59.077
Just let me understand this.

06:59.077 --> 07:02.185
The basis of your claim is that my
client faked her sexual orientation

07:02.185 --> 07:04.084
for the sole purpose of getting you
to fall in love with her

07:04.084 --> 07:07.723
so she could move into your home
and business and steal your clients.

07:07.723 --> 07:10.229
Yes. –When, in fact, it wasn't
only your business.

07:10.229 --> 07:12.232
You built it up together
over the two years.

07:12.232 --> 07:13.647
I founded the company,

07:13.647 --> 07:17.012
and most of the clients
that she left with were mine.

07:17.012 --> 07:21.772
Now, Ms Rogers, as business partners, 
as a couple, you two were quite prominent.

07:21.772 --> 07:25.606
Isn't that right? Your photos were constantly
in the “Globe” or “Boston” magazine,

07:25.606 --> 07:27.778
being called the new “it girls”.

07:27.778 --> 07:29.771
You two got more publicity
than your clients.

07:29.771 --> 07:31.592
It worked to the clients' 
benefit as well,

07:31.592 --> 07:33.164
so I don't see your point.

07:33.164 --> 07:36.106
Well, my point is that you two got 
a lot of publicity together as a couple.

07:36.106 --> 07:38.072
Business just went through the roof.

07:38.072 --> 07:41.152
Even if you were defrauded, it wasn't 
exactly to your financial detriment.

07:41.152 --> 07:43.325
It was certainly to my 
detriment when she left.

07:43.325 --> 07:45.576
Well, but even so, 
you make more money now than you

07:45.576 --> 07:49.002
did before even meeting Tracey,
so how could you have been hurt?

07:49.002 --> 07:51.161
How have I been hurt?

07:51.161 --> 07:53.829
She caused me to fall in love
with her. That…

07:53.829 --> 07:57.983
That's what this is really about,
isn't it, Ms Rogers?

07:57.983 --> 08:01.482
This isn't a business dispute.
This is a domestic one.

08:01.482 --> 08:03.852
–Did she break your heart?
–Objection.

08:04.029 --> 08:06.062
I'll allow it.

08:06.729 --> 08:09.010
Did she break your heart?

08:12.193 --> 08:13.622
Yes.

08:15.541 --> 08:18.357
You were in love with her.

08:21.143 --> 08:23.494
Now, Ms Rogers…

08:23.578 --> 08:27.283
during the two years that you 
were together with my client,

08:27.283 --> 08:29.989
do you feel that she 
was in love with you?

08:35.846 --> 08:38.207
Yes.

08:39.696 --> 08:42.193
Obviously, should I get 
a criminal conviction,

08:42.193 --> 08:45.439
that will only make it easier for the AMA
to take away my medical license.

08:45.439 --> 08:47.010
Well, you're gonna
lose your license, Bob,

08:47.010 --> 08:48.713
–so I wouldn't worry about it.
–Why?

08:48.713 --> 08:51.879
There are many doctors out there prescribing 
medication the FDA hasn't approved for…

08:51.879 --> 08:54.060
Can I stop you?

08:54.060 --> 08:55.921
Don't be self-righteous.
It's annoying.

08:55.921 --> 08:57.603
Sorry I'm late.

08:58.030 --> 09:00.134
What are you doing here?

09:00.134 --> 09:02.331
You asked me to
second chair, Denny. Remember?

09:02.331 --> 09:04.667
–Alan Shore.
–Bob Mclean.

09:04.667 --> 09:05.875
Alan.

09:09.982 --> 09:12.300
–I never asked you to second chair.
–Sure you did, Denny.

09:12.300 --> 09:13.523
You said you were trying the case…

09:13.523 --> 09:15.133
Solo.

09:15.549 --> 09:17.337
I said solo.

09:17.337 --> 09:22.777
Well, I thought you asked for backup,
so I guess one of us is losing our mind.

09:24.945 --> 09:26.855
What do you mean by that?

09:26.855 --> 09:28.373
Denny, I'm here.

09:28.373 --> 09:30.490
As you know, I'm starved
for criminal work.

09:30.490 --> 09:32.969
I want to do this alone.

09:33.695 --> 09:35.575
Is this about proving something?

09:35.575 --> 09:36.989
You said tell Shirley.

09:36.989 --> 09:40.589
Is this about proving to 
Shirley Schmidt you han't slipped?

09:43.022 --> 09:44.454
Excuse me. I'm in a meeting.

09:44.454 --> 09:46.928
Denny, I don't have time
to say this nicely,

09:46.928 --> 09:49.367
so I'm just gonna say it
with all the rough edges.

09:49.367 --> 09:52.615
This is a criminal proceeding.
That man's liberty could be at stake.

09:52.615 --> 09:55.031
I'm jumping in second chair
to cover his ass,

09:55.031 --> 09:57.433
and, yes, possibly yours as well.

10:06.125 --> 10:09.080
Could it be possible she's
doing this for the publicity?

10:09.080 --> 10:11.011
Suing me?

10:11.291 --> 10:13.697
Well, call me a cynic, but 
for two years, you're the it girls.

10:13.697 --> 10:15.958
You're Boston's top publicists.

10:15.958 --> 10:17.458
Business starts to wane,

10:17.458 --> 10:19.633
you leave, she's suddenly
not the flavor of the month.

10:19.633 --> 10:23.720
She sues you, presto, hot copy is
the split girls all over again.

10:23.720 --> 10:26.946
For the cost of attorney and filing fee,
she's featured on every news cast.

10:26.946 --> 10:30.782
As much as she loves the limelight,
Stephanie's honorable.

10:31.119 --> 10:33.365
I wonder.

10:39.077 --> 10:42.072
Is there a reason you keep
looking at me like that?

10:42.072 --> 10:44.328
Like what?

10:45.352 --> 10:47.604
I make you nervous.

10:47.604 --> 10:49.320
You need to get over that.

10:52.823 --> 10:55.247
So how many men 
have you been with?

10:56.311 --> 10:58.169
Why are you asking?

10:59.119 --> 11:01.588
I asked her because she's going 
to be asked on the stand

11:01.588 --> 11:04.352
why she has such a hard time
giving me a straight answer.

11:04.352 --> 11:05.614
However…

11:05.614 --> 11:07.404
It's because…

11:07.404 --> 11:09.764
I have doubts that 
she really is one.

11:09.764 --> 11:11.102
A homosexual.

11:11.102 --> 11:12.629
Yes.

11:12.629 --> 11:15.360
And are these doubts based
on the plaintiff's evidence

11:15.360 --> 11:17.822
or your own scientific compass?

11:20.247 --> 11:22.262
Is she attracted to you, Brad?

11:22.262 --> 11:24.293
She might be.

11:25.791 --> 11:27.411
What?

11:27.411 --> 11:29.070
Why is it men…

11:29.070 --> 11:31.680
I mean, is it the idea of losing
one to the other side,

11:31.680 --> 11:36.004
or is it since you have feelings for her,
you're anxious to believe it's mutual?

11:36.004 --> 11:37.099
You see…

11:37.099 --> 11:40.027
you sucker me with this buddy talk,
get me to reveal my feelings,

11:40.027 --> 11:43.063
and when I do, 
you punish me with them.

11:43.182 --> 11:44.984
I thought you were attracted to me.

11:44.984 --> 11:45.904
You don't want to go there.

11:45.904 --> 11:49.658
Even so, to be forgotten so easily,
and for a homosexual…

11:49.658 --> 11:52.293
is there something taped to 
my forehead that says “mock me”?

11:52.293 --> 11:54.838
Isn't coffee a lovely drug?

11:54.838 --> 11:57.624
I love brain stimulants, don't you?

11:57.961 --> 12:00.389
Uh, Catherine Pipe.

12:00.585 --> 12:02.317
Brad chase.

12:02.317 --> 12:05.963
Brad chase. You're 
defending the lesbian.

12:10.592 --> 12:13.626
Hi. I'm Lori Colson.
We haven't officially met.

12:13.626 --> 12:15.856
Hello, dear. Catherine Piper.

12:15.856 --> 12:21.178
For the future, I don't really 
appreciate comments about my hair.

12:21.178 --> 12:23.735
Oh. I'm sorry.

12:23.735 --> 12:26.214
I was just trying to make conversation,

12:26.214 --> 12:30.460
and I assumed you wouldn't want me
to go anywhere near your eyebrows.

12:39.725 --> 12:42.608
I tried diets, all of them.

12:42.608 --> 12:44.187
I exercised.

12:44.187 --> 12:46.233
I'd gone on fen-phen years ago,

12:46.233 --> 12:48.351
and that helped a little,

12:48.351 --> 12:50.794
but mainly, I just kept getting bigger.

12:50.794 --> 12:54.204
And at some point, the defendant
mentioned a new drug.

12:54.204 --> 12:57.129
Yes. I forgot how he said
he had access to it,

12:57.129 --> 12:59.968
but basically, he said 
he had this new drug,

12:59.968 --> 13:02.388
not on the market yet 
called Ramonibend,

13:02.388 --> 13:06.488
and studies showed how it could
help people lose weight.

13:06.488 --> 13:08.844
Desperate as I was, I just said yes.

13:08.844 --> 13:10.793
He sold you this drug in his office.

13:10.793 --> 13:14.600
Yes, and he told me not to tell anyone

13:14.600 --> 13:17.769
because he said it was illegal
for him to be giving it to me.

13:17.769 --> 13:19.626
Thank you, Mr Harrison.

13:31.148 --> 13:33.374
I can't help but notice
you're really fat.

13:33.374 --> 13:34.507
Yes.

13:34.507 --> 13:36.063
You been fatter? –Much.

13:36.063 --> 13:37.977
Drug worked. –Huge.

13:37.977 --> 13:40.467
I mean, I lost weight,
my cholesterol went down,

13:40.467 --> 13:42.405
my HDL actually went up.

13:42.405 --> 13:44.076
I mean, it was a godsend.

13:44.076 --> 13:45.575
Of course, till the…

13:45.575 --> 13:47.152
you know, 
police cut off my supplier.

13:47.152 --> 13:49.066
Objection to the word 
“supplier,” your honor.

13:49.066 --> 13:50.543
It makes my client sound 
like a drug dealer.

13:50.543 --> 13:52.371
He is a drug dealer.
He sold him drugs.

13:52.371 --> 13:54.581
Yes, but there's a bias that
goes to the word “dealer.”

13:54.581 --> 13:57.853
He simply prescribed him medicine
to help him live.

13:58.438 --> 13:59.459
He's right.

13:59.459 --> 14:01.346
This man almost died.

14:02.178 --> 14:04.711
–Didn't he?
–Didn't you?

14:04.711 --> 14:08.705
I had high blood pressure,
high cholesterol, diabetes.

14:08.705 --> 14:12.355
I mean, I was at serious risk
for a major heart attack or a stroke.

14:12.355 --> 14:13.950
Probably still am.

14:13.950 --> 14:16.685
Since you stopped taking the drug?

14:16.988 --> 14:20.034
I'm having problems again.

14:20.034 --> 14:23.583
Did my client tell you that this
drug is unapproved by the FDA?

14:23.583 --> 14:25.394
Yes.

14:25.394 --> 14:27.234
Did he tell you that, uh,

14:27.234 --> 14:28.896
–there could be side effects?
–Yes.

14:28.896 --> 14:30.315
–You were fully informed.
–I was.

14:30.315 --> 14:31.548
–You consented.
–I did.

14:31.548 --> 14:32.867
–Take it again?
–Absolutely.

14:32.867 --> 14:34.114
–Like the doctor.
–Love him.

14:34.114 --> 14:35.635
–How's your memory?
–My memory's fine.

14:35.635 --> 14:36.990
–What's my name?
–Denny Crane.

14:36.990 --> 14:38.327
–Like you mean it.
–Denny Crane.

14:38.327 --> 14:41.135
–What's my name?
–Denny Crane!

14:41.509 --> 14:42.769
No further questions.

14:48.996 --> 14:51.609
Stephanie Rogers is 
essentially accusing Ms Green

14:51.609 --> 14:53.625
of being a heterosexual 
in sheep's clothing.

14:53.625 --> 14:58.050
If successful, the plaintiff could potentially receive
a judgment in excess of seven figures.

14:58.050 --> 14:59.688
Which is why perhaps…

15:00.477 --> 15:01.842
Wait, she wasn't finished.

15:01.842 --> 15:03.822
Doesn't matter how it's
playing out in public, Tracey.

15:03.822 --> 15:06.651
What matters are the 12 
people in that box.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.333
And?

15:09.333 --> 15:11.674
I can't tell.

15:11.910 --> 15:14.028
Well, you've dated 
more men than women,

15:14.028 --> 15:16.334
so that puts you on the heterosexual
side of the fence.

15:16.334 --> 15:18.245
You certainly could have
been confused, as they said,

15:18.245 --> 15:24.267
but the problem is you're coming 
off as anything but indecisive.

15:25.068 --> 15:28.804
You seem like a woman who knows
exactly what you want.

15:28.804 --> 15:31.974
What is that supposed to mean?

15:32.114 --> 15:34.124
Nothing.

15:37.248 --> 15:40.220
You actually think that 
I'm attracted to you.

15:40.367 --> 15:43.760
I just believe you should be
straight with people.

15:43.760 --> 15:45.177
You know what I mean.

15:45.177 --> 15:47.140
I smell some deceit here.

15:47.140 --> 15:49.604
I'm gay, Brad.

15:50.135 --> 15:52.850
Do you want me 
to take a lie detector?

16:04.442 --> 16:06.906
People lament the cost of health care.

16:06.906 --> 16:09.796
They cry over soaring litigation costs

16:09.796 --> 16:13.505
and scream about the eroding 
integrity of our medical profession.

16:13.505 --> 16:17.083
The conduct of this doctor
and others like him are to blame.

16:17.083 --> 16:21.302
–Oh, lighten up, man.
–Mr Crane, you'll get your turn.

16:21.426 --> 16:23.262
We have rules.

16:23.262 --> 16:26.414
One is we do not go prescribing
experimental drugs

16:26.414 --> 16:28.632
that the FDA hasn't 
approved for market.

16:28.632 --> 16:30.548
Even if the patient consents?

16:30.548 --> 16:33.508
The patient will always
follow the lead of his doctor.

16:33.508 --> 16:36.501
For god's sake, look what 
people buy off infomercials.

16:36.501 --> 16:37.856
They'll try anything,

16:37.856 --> 16:41.574
hair potions, pills that make you
lose weight while you sleep.

16:41.574 --> 16:43.697
Desperate people will try anything,

16:43.697 --> 16:49.377
and when you have a licensed doctor
saying “here, take this,” they will.

16:49.377 --> 16:51.274
This isn't a potion.
This drug works.

16:51.274 --> 16:55.196
In preliminary studies, but there's
much, much more testing to be done.

16:55.196 --> 16:57.498
How long does it take the FDA 
to approve a drug?

16:57.498 --> 16:58.773
It isn't quick, but…

16:58.773 --> 17:00.368
How long?

17:00.368 --> 17:01.642
Nine years.

17:01.642 --> 17:03.656
My client's patient 
would be dead by then.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.226
But, hey, you've got your rules.

17:05.226 --> 17:06.737
–Objection.
–Oh, be quiet.

17:06.737 --> 17:08.673
Your honor, 
he can't tell me to be quiet.

17:08.673 --> 17:11.207
Let him have his turn, Mr Zale.

17:11.207 --> 17:17.433
You say that doctors shouldn't prescribe
non-FDA-approved drugs as a rule.

17:17.433 --> 17:21.420
–Yes. 
–Doctors don't prescribe medications

17:21.420 --> 17:23.925
for things that the FDA hasn't
approved them for.

17:23.925 --> 17:25.785
Off-label prescriptions happen, but…

17:25.785 --> 17:27.577
Doctor, have you ever prescribed a drug

17:27.577 --> 17:30.556
that wasn't approved for the particular
condition you were treating?

17:30.556 --> 17:32.293
–Yes, but…
–and, doctor,

17:32.293 --> 17:34.009
if you were overweight

17:34.009 --> 17:38.658
and at risk for an imminent
stroke or heart attack,

17:38.658 --> 17:43.020
is it your testimony that you would 
never consider taking Ramonibend?

17:43.020 --> 17:45.064
For myself, I might, but…

17:45.064 --> 17:47.816
but you wouldn't give your patient

17:47.816 --> 17:51.294
the same opportunity

17:51.294 --> 17:54.080
because you have rules.

18:03.150 --> 18:06.833
You're going to be the first lawyer sued 
by his client for sexual harassment.

18:06.833 --> 18:08.663
I'm a good lawyer because I got
a nose for the truth, Lori.

18:08.663 --> 18:12.024
You're attracted to her, Brad.
It's clouding your nose.

18:12.187 --> 18:13.888
Are you falling in love
with this woman?

18:13.888 --> 18:16.102
What? Please.

18:16.238 --> 18:18.379
–Are you?
–Of course not.

18:20.785 --> 18:22.563
I put a tail on her.

18:22.563 --> 18:23.736
I beg your pardon?

18:23.736 --> 18:26.532
I hired a P.I. just to follow 
her around, see who she sees.

18:26.532 --> 18:27.910
What she sees.

18:27.910 --> 18:29.943
You're trying to out her
as a heterosexual.

18:29.943 --> 18:31.269
I don't like surprises in court.

18:31.269 --> 18:33.723
Okay, first, you could lose 
your bar ticket for putting a P.I…

18:33.723 --> 18:37.049
–Why? It's not that big of a deal.
–Brad, she's your client.

18:37.049 --> 18:39.952
Second, let the jury decide
whether or not she's being truthful.

18:39.952 --> 18:43.404
You just be her lawyer
and only, and third…

18:44.213 --> 18:46.423
Stop hitting on her.

18:52.453 --> 18:53.997
Hey, Brad.

18:53.997 --> 18:55.545
All together now.

18:55.545 --> 18:57.355
Lesbian.

18:59.492 --> 19:00.928
Boys…

19:00.928 --> 19:02.203
how's our trial going?

19:02.203 --> 19:05.088
You think I'm just gonna wither
up and die in there, don't you?

19:05.088 --> 19:08.050
All these references
to our sex life, Denny.

19:08.050 --> 19:09.365
Tell her how I'm doing, Alan.

19:09.365 --> 19:11.149
Please, since he can't recall.

19:11.149 --> 19:12.104
He's been amazing.

19:12.104 --> 19:14.684
I'd say we have 
a better-than-even chance.

19:17.559 --> 19:18.472
Hello.

19:18.472 --> 19:20.323
Hello.

19:21.173 --> 19:23.545
Is there a reason you're 
snuggled up to me?

19:23.545 --> 19:25.079
Well, yes.

19:25.079 --> 19:27.076
I understand 
you're the boss, dear.

19:27.076 --> 19:28.978
I'm sucking up.

19:29.314 --> 19:31.092
By standing next to me.

19:31.092 --> 19:32.256
Yes.

19:32.256 --> 19:35.823
With me by your side, dear,
you almost look young.

19:36.620 --> 19:39.044
I have no idea who you are,

19:39.044 --> 19:40.649
but I like you.

19:42.032 --> 19:43.244
Is he really doing okay?

19:43.244 --> 19:45.104
The firm is safe from ridicule.

19:49.765 --> 19:51.557
What did she want?

19:52.409 --> 19:54.113
Make sure I'm competent?

19:54.113 --> 19:56.359
Something like that.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.320
You were more than competent
today, Denny.

19:58.320 --> 20:00.330
–You were good, very good.
–I know.

20:00.330 --> 20:03.659
We must be doing our 
crosswords these days.

20:04.669 --> 20:07.668
Did she ask you to backstop me?

20:07.668 --> 20:09.373
It was my idea.

20:09.373 --> 20:12.141
–Damn liar.
–I like doing cases with you, Denny.

20:12.141 --> 20:14.361
Can't you just accept that?
It's fun.

20:15.869 --> 20:18.589
Fun, fine.
I'll go with that, then.

20:18.589 --> 20:22.658
You have seemed especially acute.
Are we taking something?

20:23.428 --> 20:28.281
I just rubbed on a little clear cream.
It was just for muscle cramps.

20:29.139 --> 20:31.121
Denny?

20:32.490 --> 20:35.179
Are you taking something?

20:35.982 --> 20:38.262
What I am taking…

20:38.262 --> 20:40.199
is good care of myself.

20:40.199 --> 20:43.451
The old Denny Crane is coming back.

20:53.646 --> 20:56.498
Our business had 
reached sort of a plateau,

20:56.498 --> 20:58.708
and I felt I could do better solo.

20:58.708 --> 21:00.571
And truthfully, I thought
that she might, too.

21:00.571 --> 21:02.925
Now, before leaving, did
you tell your clients?

21:02.925 --> 21:04.524
Absolutely not.

21:04.524 --> 21:09.407
I left, I contacted them, they 
decided to come with me, in that order.

21:09.407 --> 21:11.023
Now, Tracey, 
we've heard the accusation

21:11.023 --> 21:13.735
that you pretended to love 
Stephanie for business reasons.

21:13.735 --> 21:15.646
It's absolutely false.

21:18.121 --> 21:19.771
I fell in love with her.

21:19.771 --> 21:24.753
I mean, the idea that I could 
feign love for 2-plus years just…

21:25.845 --> 21:27.847
you know how much
I loved you, Stephanie.

21:27.847 --> 21:32.003
Ms Green, please do not address 
anyone but me or your counsel.

21:33.871 --> 21:37.232
I never lied to her about 
my sexual orientation,

21:37.232 --> 21:39.006
and I'm offended by that.

21:39.006 --> 21:42.511
How many women had you been with
prior to your relationship with my client?

21:42.511 --> 21:44.734
–Objection.
–Overruled.

21:44.734 --> 21:47.285
However salacious, it's in issue.

21:47.285 --> 21:48.456
How many women?

21:48.456 --> 21:50.251
–One.
–One.

21:50.251 --> 21:52.406
And prior to your relationship 
with my client,

21:52.406 --> 21:54.936
how many men had you had
sexual relationships with?

21:54.936 --> 21:56.765
–Several.
–Several.

21:56.765 --> 21:58.759
–More than five?
–Yes.

21:58.759 --> 22:02.197
–More than 10?
–I wanted to lead a heterosexual life.

22:02.197 --> 22:03.528
Eventually, I realized…

22:03.528 --> 22:05.791
My client asked you
if you were bisexual.

22:05.791 --> 22:08.068
–You answered no.
–Because I'm not.

22:08.068 --> 22:10.468
I may have been 
with men in the past,

22:10.468 --> 22:13.043
but ultimately, I realized
I preferred women.

22:13.043 --> 22:15.739
How many relationships have 
you had since Stephanie?

22:15.739 --> 22:18.327
–One.
–With a man or a woman?

22:18.441 --> 22:20.834
Look, the breakup with Stephanie
was extremely painful.

22:20.834 --> 22:24.420
Your subsequent relationship
was with a man or a woman?

22:24.420 --> 22:26.854
–A man.
–A man.

22:26.854 --> 22:30.752
Now, you spoke earlier about the exact
order of how things went down.

22:30.752 --> 22:32.750
Rewinding a little further back,

22:32.750 --> 22:34.888
you met Stephanie, 
became her lover,

22:34.888 --> 22:37.111
eventually became
her business partner,

22:37.111 --> 22:41.099
left with clients and files,
began having an affair with a man.

22:41.099 --> 22:43.097
Did I get the order right?

22:52.551 --> 22:54.964
I just got destroyed.

22:54.964 --> 22:56.550
Didn't I?

22:56.550 --> 22:58.009
You didn't get destroyed.

22:58.009 --> 23:00.889
It was a tough cross,
but I thought you held up.

23:01.948 --> 23:03.400
Really?

23:03.400 --> 23:05.282
Really.

23:06.643 --> 23:08.964
You know…

23:09.856 --> 23:16.441
to think that I'm straight is to believe
that I'm a profoundly dishonest person.

23:17.929 --> 23:21.512
And I'm not dishonest, Brad.

23:21.538 --> 23:23.842
–Okay.
–You know, I…

23:24.053 --> 23:28.552
I can take you doubting 
my sexual orientation but…

23:28.552 --> 23:30.333
my character, I, uh…

23:30.333 --> 23:31.837
I don't doubt you.

23:36.931 --> 23:40.213
–She's trying to admit something.
–What, that she's not gay?

23:40.213 --> 23:42.495
I don't know. Maybe.

23:43.998 --> 23:46.210
You're making 
a fool of yourself, Brad.

23:46.210 --> 23:47.998
I know when 
I'm being deceived, Tara.

23:47.998 --> 23:50.129
The deception is self-inflicted.

23:50.129 --> 23:53.124
You're infatuated with her,
and you want to believe it's reciprocal.

23:53.124 --> 23:57.224
She's probably more interested
in me than you.

23:57.224 --> 23:59.575
You're making a fool of yourself.

24:02.317 --> 24:04.588
I considered it life or death.

24:04.588 --> 24:07.467
He was at risk of cardiac arrest,
diabetes…

24:07.467 --> 24:09.972
and this drug was your only resort?

24:09.972 --> 24:11.761
It was my last resort.

24:11.761 --> 24:15.895
Believe me, I am not in the habit of
prescribing non-approved drugs, but this…

24:15.895 --> 24:19.426
Doctor, would you tell 
the jury and me, too,

24:19.426 --> 24:21.564
for that matter, because 
I've forgotten.

24:21.564 --> 24:24.170
How Ramonibend works.

24:25.093 --> 24:29.210
It suppresses a protein in the brain
that makes you want to eat.

24:29.210 --> 24:32.321
In fact, this drug blocks
nearly all cravings.

24:32.321 --> 24:36.513
It can be used to help people 
quit smoking, drinking.

24:36.513 --> 24:39.273
Which is why it's been called
the wonder drug.

24:39.273 --> 24:43.064
So you just figured what the hell,
why wait for proof?

24:43.064 --> 24:45.541
My patient couldn't wait, Mr Zale.

24:45.541 --> 24:48.141
He was looking at an imminent
physical demise.

24:48.141 --> 24:50.143
In medical terms, we call it death.

24:50.143 --> 24:52.256
Any published studies on this drug?

24:52.256 --> 24:54.558
To justify this wonder status
you give it.

24:54.558 --> 24:57.098
–Not yet.
–Has this drug been approved for sale?

24:57.098 --> 24:58.355
Not yet.

24:58.355 --> 25:01.115
How'd you get your hands
on this drug, doctor?

25:01.221 --> 25:04.554
I had a connection at one of 
the clinics where it's being tested.

25:04.554 --> 25:06.318
I won't reveal more than that.

25:06.318 --> 25:07.948
You're a licensed doctor

25:07.948 --> 25:11.902
prescribing a drug not approved 
by the FDA to desperate patients.

25:11.902 --> 25:12.938
With a full warning.

25:12.938 --> 25:16.566
How can you warn about a drug 
side effect you don't know about?

25:16.566 --> 25:19.390
The warning that I gave 
Mr Harrison was exactly that.

25:19.390 --> 25:21.209
This drug may have side effects
we don't know about.

25:21.209 --> 25:22.642
Possible fatal side effects.

25:22.642 --> 25:24.577
–There's no evidence of that.
–So you decided…

25:24.577 --> 25:27.503
balancing the benefits against 
the known risk of a coronary

25:27.503 --> 25:30.032
if he doesn't take it,
I favor taking the medication.

25:30.032 --> 25:33.182
–This is an experimental drug.
–Which I have no financial interest in.

25:33.182 --> 25:36.858
–Which you bootlegged.
–My only concern was a patient's health.

25:36.858 --> 25:40.081
So doctors should feel free to
ignore the FDA whenever they choose.

25:40.081 --> 25:42.568
I never said that. –So you should 
feel free whenever you choose.

25:42.568 --> 25:45.457
Sometimes desperate circumstances
require desperate measures.

25:45.457 --> 25:48.908
And desperate people will
do anything, won't they?

26:01.945 --> 26:03.939
Denny.

26:04.765 --> 26:06.714
You're checking 
on me in here, too?

26:06.714 --> 26:08.478
Think I forgot how to piss?

26:08.478 --> 26:09.707
I beg your pardon?

26:09.707 --> 26:11.904
I'm tired of being followed
around like some patient.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.941
I change my underwear every day.
I know how to practice law.

26:13.941 --> 26:16.882
And if you're the one who assigned
Alan Shore to backstop me,

26:16.882 --> 26:18.837
–then you better stop…
–You listen.

26:18.837 --> 26:21.185
–I'm still talking.
–Now I'm talking.

26:21.185 --> 26:25.969
You arrogant old fart,
you have a client facing prison time.

26:25.969 --> 26:28.151
You have no right to exalt your ego.

26:28.151 --> 26:29.327
Don't you talk to me in that…

26:29.327 --> 26:30.910
Shut up!

26:30.910 --> 26:34.118
I am sick of you feeling sorry
for yourself and only yourself.

26:34.118 --> 26:37.397
It was selfish of you
to try this case solo.

26:37.397 --> 26:40.184
Do not start a war with me here.

26:40.184 --> 26:42.349
You may not win it.

26:42.999 --> 26:46.073
That's why you brought Shirley back.

26:46.453 --> 26:48.780
To build an alliance!

26:53.615 --> 26:56.707
Guess you're the one
who forgot how to piss.

27:10.370 --> 27:12.513
Does it smell right to you?

27:12.513 --> 27:16.123
She had a history of men
before my client.

27:16.123 --> 27:20.490
She never hinted to her best friends
that she was anything but heterosexual.

27:20.490 --> 27:24.576
She had an affair with a man
after she left my client.

27:24.576 --> 27:26.601
Her only fling with homosexuality

27:26.601 --> 27:30.711
just happened to coincide with the biggest
financial windfall of her life.

27:30.711 --> 27:32.870
Suddenly being gay got her money,

27:32.870 --> 27:37.850
got her profiled about town
in magazines, on tv, as an it girl.

27:37.850 --> 27:44.113
Newfound fame, newfound money,
newfound sexual orientation.

27:44.821 --> 27:47.932
Does it smell right to you?

27:48.162 --> 27:51.051
In order to make a cause 
of action for fraud,

27:51.051 --> 27:54.849
one must prove that he or she relied on 
the fraud to his or her own detriment.

27:54.849 --> 27:57.315
Now, after partnering with my client,

27:57.315 --> 28:00.796
Ms Rogers' financial and 
professional fortunes soared.

28:00.796 --> 28:01.987
She benefited.

28:01.987 --> 28:04.016
In fact, one might even say,
considering

28:04.016 --> 28:05.612
the media coverage
of this lawsuit,

28:05.612 --> 28:07.685
that she's actually benefiting
from the breakup,

28:07.685 --> 28:11.622
because as any P.R. professional knows,
there's no such thing as bad publicity.

28:11.622 --> 28:14.186
But if you're determined
to get hung up on the issue

28:14.186 --> 28:18.226
is Tracey Green gay or not,
did she really love Stephanie or not,

28:18.226 --> 28:20.811
consider Stephanie's own testimony.

28:20.811 --> 28:24.591
When I asked her 
during the relationship

28:24.591 --> 28:26.933
as she was living it,

28:26.933 --> 28:31.092
did she feel that Tracey loved her?

28:31.092 --> 28:34.738
And she answered yes.

28:34.870 --> 28:37.016
But now in the wake 
of hurt and heartbreak,

28:37.016 --> 28:39.751
she offers a different answer.

28:41.210 --> 28:44.591
Which version do 
you find more reliable?

29:05.968 --> 29:06.975
Anything?

29:06.975 --> 29:09.103
No, they're still deliberating.

29:09.658 --> 29:11.326
–What's this?
–I haven't the slightest idea.

29:11.326 --> 29:14.883
Your secretary said you'd
want it sooner rather than later.

29:17.591 --> 29:19.338
What is it?

29:19.338 --> 29:22.501
It's nothing.
It's just another case I'm working on.

29:39.794 --> 29:44.899
Do I have to convince you of the danger
of prescribing non-approved drugs?

29:44.899 --> 29:50.605
Defrauding overweight people with diet
gimmicks is a billion-dollar industry,

29:50.605 --> 29:54.216
and now we're going to let
doctors get in on the racket

29:54.216 --> 29:58.662
and say it's okay to sell black-market
pills under the table?

29:58.662 --> 30:02.430
It's precisely 
because physicians have

30:02.430 --> 30:04.719
such an influence over their patients

30:04.719 --> 30:09.862
that we demand that drugs 
be approvedby the FDA.

30:09.862 --> 30:15.497
But this doctor decided
he shouldn't be held to that.

30:15.497 --> 30:19.167
This doctor figured 
he's above the law.

30:19.167 --> 30:22.444
This doctor is the equivalent
of a drug dealer

30:22.444 --> 30:25.158
selling cocaine in an alleyway,

30:25.158 --> 30:28.206
and he should be 
punished accordingly.

30:35.501 --> 30:37.142
–I thought I was closing.
–I'm first chair.

30:37.142 --> 30:39.193
–You got to ask all the questions.
–Objection.

30:39.193 --> 30:43.460
Your honor, these two have tried
to trivialize the severity of this case

30:43.460 --> 30:47.577
with their Abbott and Costello routine,
but it's an insult to this court.

30:47.577 --> 30:49.819
Your honor, it's only fair
I get to do something here.

30:49.819 --> 30:53.024
Mr Shore, the court is 
anything but amused.

30:53.024 --> 30:54.704
–I'm not..
–No, I, I got it.

30:54.948 --> 30:56.564
We'll split it.

30:57.307 --> 30:58.719
You go first.

30:59.050 --> 31:00.138
Fine.

31:02.523 --> 31:05.149
Okay, first, this big deal
about FDA approval…

31:05.149 --> 31:10.902
doctors prescribe medications every day
for uses the FDA never considered.

31:10.902 --> 31:15.198
Aspirin, for years, has been used
to prevent and treat heart attacks.

31:15.198 --> 31:17.792
Did the FDA ever test for that? No.

31:17.792 --> 31:20.552
It was sanctioned only as 
a pain reliever until recently.

31:20.552 --> 31:24.505
Beta-blockers are prescribed
for migraines with no FDA approval.

31:24.505 --> 31:28.134
We take anti-convulsants for pain,
for bipolar disorders.

31:28.134 --> 31:32.087
Antidepressants for insomnia,
steroids for cancer.

31:32.087 --> 31:36.968
People in this country are getting 
prescriptions by the thousands

31:36.968 --> 31:42.290
every day from their doctors for 
treatments the FDA never signed off on.

31:42.290 --> 31:43.787
And what about the FDA?

31:43.787 --> 31:46.448
David Graham, a drug 
reviewer with the agency,

31:46.448 --> 31:50.653
just testified before congress
that the FDA is, I quote,

31:50.653 --> 31:55.611
“virtually incapable of protecting 
America from unsafe drugs.”

31:55.611 --> 31:58.568
The FDA is broken, folks.

31:58.568 --> 32:01.311
Raise your hand if you agree,
except those of you on vioxin.

32:01.311 --> 32:05.375
Objection. –The FDA's 
own point man said to congress

32:05.375 --> 32:10.855
that we are currently facing the 
single greatest drug safety catastrophe

32:10.855 --> 32:12.920
in the history of the world.

32:12.920 --> 32:15.396
So who, then, is there to 
protect the patient?

32:15.396 --> 32:18.872
Who is there to 
protect Mr Harrison?

32:18.872 --> 32:21.193
His doctor.

32:22.106 --> 32:27.764
My client had a medication
that could save his patient's life.

32:27.764 --> 32:35.494
He wasn't going to wait nine years for 
approval from a broken, ineffective agency.

32:35.494 --> 32:38.065
This is life or death, for god's sake.

32:38.065 --> 32:41.881
Life or death.

33:02.180 --> 33:05.121
I'm at risk for Alzheimer's.

33:05.121 --> 33:09.921
I've got some sort of plaque
going on inside my brain.

33:09.921 --> 33:12.384
My memory…

33:12.877 --> 33:16.620
I might have met some of you before.
I wouldn't know.

33:19.617 --> 33:24.062
What you wouldn't know
is what it feels like to be…

33:25.106 --> 33:28.092
losing it, to be…

33:28.092 --> 33:30.912
feel…

33:31.279 --> 33:33.982
to be slipping.

33:39.950 --> 33:44.241
There's a prescription drug…

33:45.475 --> 33:48.794
dextroamphetamine.

33:48.794 --> 33:50.928
It's very big on the black market.

33:50.928 --> 33:55.490
It's used by college kids
to bone up for exams.

33:56.338 --> 33:59.504
I've been taking it.

34:02.079 --> 34:04.602
I don't know how it works,

34:04.602 --> 34:07.035
but you get your memory back.

34:07.035 --> 34:09.496
It reintroduces you
to your vocabulary,

34:09.496 --> 34:15.748
helps with mental arithmetic,
facial recognition, overall productivity.

34:16.906 --> 34:19.585
Basically…

34:19.856 --> 34:22.408
you get your brain back.

34:22.962 --> 34:27.397
And no FDA or any 
other agency is gonna

34:27.397 --> 34:32.210
tell me I don't have the right
to get back my brain.

34:32.620 --> 34:37.783
No government or, 
or court is gonna tell me,

34:38.033 --> 34:42.770
order me to 
continue losing my mind.

34:45.253 --> 34:47.289
I agree with the prosecutor.

34:47.289 --> 34:55.641
His claim that desperate people
will try desperate measures.

34:59.662 --> 35:02.162
So what?

35:43.872 --> 35:46.126
–Members of the jury,
–have you reached a verdict?

35:46.126 --> 35:48.446
–Yes, we have, your honor.
–We have, your honor.

35:48.446 --> 35:51.791
–What say you?
–In the matter of Rogers vs. Green…

35:51.791 --> 35:55.245
In the matter of the commonwealth
of Massachusetts vs. Dr Robert Mclean…

35:55.245 --> 35:59.881
we the jury find in favor
of the defendant.

36:00.084 --> 36:02.969
We find the defendant
Dr Robert Mclean

36:02.969 --> 36:04.769
not guilty.

36:04.769 --> 36:07.368
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I want to thank you for your service.

36:07.368 --> 36:09.408
At this time, you are dismissed.

36:09.408 --> 36:10.960
Court adjourned.

36:21.808 --> 36:24.219
So did she say anything after?

36:24.319 --> 36:27.654
She just shot me a look when
she was leaving the courthouse.

36:27.654 --> 36:28.748
She'll get over it.

36:28.748 --> 36:29.907
Yeah, I bet she will.

36:29.907 --> 36:32.394
Who knows? Maybe we'll even
get back together one day.

36:32.394 --> 36:34.497
Wouldn't be surprised.

36:35.675 --> 36:39.281
So why did you want 
to have dinner, Brad?

36:39.531 --> 36:41.663
To celebrate the victory or, uh…

36:41.663 --> 36:44.012
take one last shot at conversion?

36:49.060 --> 36:52.812
I wanted to have 
dinner to apologize.

36:53.992 --> 36:56.048
I did a really…

36:56.048 --> 36:58.523
terrible thing.

36:58.788 --> 37:01.986
I hired a private investigator
to follow you.

37:01.986 --> 37:05.811
I wanted to satisfy myself
that you were really gay,

37:06.434 --> 37:09.111
and I'm quite satisfied now.

37:11.999 --> 37:17.671
You went to see Stephanie
around midnight last night.

37:17.960 --> 37:20.086
Why would you do that?

37:23.300 --> 37:26.575
Well, had it half right.
Didn't I?

37:26.575 --> 37:29.525
You know, thinking Stephanie
sued you for…

37:29.525 --> 37:31.537
the publicity.

37:32.417 --> 37:34.540
You were both in on it.

37:34.906 --> 37:37.898
It girls or split girls…

37:38.627 --> 37:42.107
however you make the news,
you two are a really good team.

37:43.890 --> 37:46.810
Because I knew 
I was being deceived.

37:46.810 --> 37:49.488
I just wasn't sure how.

37:53.388 --> 37:57.940
I didn't plan for you to fall for me.

37:58.481 --> 38:01.122
Well, don't flatter yourself.

38:03.932 --> 38:06.046
I think that I should leave.

38:06.046 --> 38:07.694
No, no, you don't have to.
We won the case.

38:07.694 --> 38:09.944
Come on, this is a celebration.

38:11.744 --> 38:13.659
I'm gonna leave.

38:13.659 --> 38:15.801
Thank you, Brad.

38:17.126 --> 38:20.315
Um, and again,

38:20.584 --> 38:23.310
I'm sorry if…

38:27.721 --> 38:29.298
Thank you.

39:05.595 --> 39:07.511
That drug you're taking 
is an amphetamine

39:07.511 --> 39:11.464
with a dangerously high potential
for abuse and addiction.

39:12.152 --> 39:15.430
The shrinks are 
doling it out like candy.

39:17.258 --> 39:19.843
Might make you feel more acute.

39:19.843 --> 39:22.954
You'll no doubt work like a demon.

39:22.954 --> 39:26.375
But certain pleasures will be gone.

39:26.511 --> 39:28.433
Like?

39:28.852 --> 39:31.442
Perhaps fishing…

39:31.442 --> 39:37.055
perhaps sitting in a chair
enjoying a football game…

39:37.215 --> 39:40.226
standing on a balcony…

39:40.226 --> 39:44.109
appreciating the quiet
joy of a friendship.

39:46.446 --> 39:49.823
There's more to life than 
recognizing faces, Denny.

39:49.823 --> 39:51.954
You prefer me in my fog?

39:51.954 --> 39:54.019
I prefer you.

39:55.192 --> 39:59.127
Your perspective and your humor,

39:59.127 --> 40:02.978
the acceptance and humility which…

40:02.978 --> 40:05.880
perhaps can only come with age.

40:08.341 --> 40:10.729
I prefer you.

40:19.135 --> 40:21.503
I've stopped taking the drug.

40:22.672 --> 40:25.537
I kind of like my fog, too.

40:26.906 --> 40:29.892
There's a certain license
that goes with it.

40:29.892 --> 40:33.344
Plus, I've said this before,
and I'll say it again.

40:33.438 --> 40:35.414
The answers in life…

40:35.414 --> 40:38.205
you don't find them here.

40:40.247 --> 40:44.017
First you look to god…

40:44.402 --> 40:47.950
and then…

40:49.200 --> 40:50.820
Fox news.

40:50.820 --> 40:52.756
Damn right.

40:54.124 --> 40:56.710
You Democrats.

40:57.017 --> 40:59.268
You Republicans.

40:59.328 --> 41:00.543
Shirley know I won?

41:00.543 --> 41:02.830
–Told her myself.
–What'd she say?

41:02.830 --> 41:05.049
She'd like to have your children.

41:05.457 --> 41:07.578
Damn right.
