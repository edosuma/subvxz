01:01.061 --> 01:02.938
Tori Frederking is back.

01:02.996 --> 01:04.599
Her parents sent her
to Europe for the summer

01:04.664 --> 01:06.644
as a graduation gift,
but she's back.

01:06.699 --> 01:09.612
And I have three confirmed
sightings of her in this mall.

01:09.669 --> 01:11.671
Matt, I don't care
about Tori Frederking.

01:11.738 --> 01:15.208
I care about her,
aged to perfection.

01:15.275 --> 01:16.777
- Man...
- Daddy likey.

01:16.843 --> 01:18.186
Barry, you gotta focus here, man.

01:18.244 --> 01:20.383
I'm talking about The Frederking.

01:20.447 --> 01:23.894
You have to focus, OK?
That was in the tenth grade.

01:23.950 --> 01:25.896
You got truth-or-dared
into a closet with the girl.

01:25.952 --> 01:28.956
It was literally
seven minutes in heaven.

01:29.022 --> 01:31.093
When we got out of that closet,
she told everyone at that party

01:31.157 --> 01:32.431
that I was an amazing kisser.

01:32.492 --> 01:34.233
- ...amazing kisser.
- She did.

01:34.294 --> 01:35.796
But you didn't kiss her.

01:35.862 --> 01:38.365
You spent seven minutes shitting
your pants and not making a move.

01:38.431 --> 01:40.274
I know, that's what makes
her so fucking awesome.

01:40.333 --> 01:41.368
When I got out of the closet,

01:41.434 --> 01:43.107
everyone started ragging
on me for choking,

01:43.169 --> 01:45.581
she lied and said
that I was an amazing kisser.

01:45.638 --> 01:48.244
- Pretty stellar move, huh?
- To the max.

01:48.308 --> 01:51.118
Oh, my God, I've been hearing this story
since we shared our mother's uterus.

01:51.177 --> 01:52.417
Oh, and by the way,

01:52.479 --> 01:54.857
did you even have the balls
to ask her out after that?

01:54.914 --> 01:56.450
- I can't recall.
- No, but only because...

01:56.516 --> 01:59.759
I never had my in.
Don't do this.

01:59.819 --> 02:01.856
Hey. Come on.

02:02.589 --> 02:04.694
How do you always know
what I'm gonna say? Fuck!

02:04.757 --> 02:06.395
You guys are really freaking
me out with that twin shit.

02:06.459 --> 02:07.733
Watch and learn, brother.

02:07.794 --> 02:09.899
I'm going in.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.465
Eye of the tiger, buddy.

02:11.531 --> 02:14.978
Eye of the tiger.

02:15.034 --> 02:16.513
I don't like how this looks.

02:16.569 --> 02:17.912
No, no good.

02:22.242 --> 02:25.416
So...
So you like, uh, music?

02:26.312 --> 02:27.450
I hate it.

02:28.882 --> 02:29.917
Swing and a miss.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.690
- Ooh...
- Swing and a miss.

02:31.751 --> 02:33.355
Oh, not the book, Barry.

02:33.419 --> 02:35.763
Oh, no, no,
not The Art of War Oh, God.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.132
You ever read, uh...
Sun Tzu's Art of War?

02:39.292 --> 02:41.966
I have. It's amazing.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.505
I'll give you my number.

02:44.564 --> 02:46.043
I'll loan it to you.

02:46.099 --> 02:48.340
Get back to me at a later
date of your choosing,

02:48.401 --> 02:50.142
and we'll have a...

02:50.203 --> 02:53.184
I don't know, a bottle
of chilled white zin.

02:53.239 --> 02:54.513
Holy shit!

02:59.512 --> 03:01.150
Oh!

03:08.221 --> 03:10.633
I'm free on, uh... Saturday.

03:11.524 --> 03:12.628
Call me.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.791
Win one for the Gipper.

04:34.741 --> 04:35.947
Hey, Tori!

04:36.009 --> 04:37.511
Hey, guys.

04:44.550 --> 04:45.585
Wow.

04:46.786 --> 04:48.663
This humpback whale
just swims by me, right?

04:48.721 --> 04:50.997
I've never felt
so scared in my life.

04:51.057 --> 04:53.094
That's when it hit me.

04:53.159 --> 04:54.638
This is what
I want to do with my life.

04:54.694 --> 04:56.367
This is what
I want others to see.

04:56.429 --> 04:58.875
That's why the second
I got back to LA...

04:58.931 --> 05:01.673
Boom! Open Mint Travel.

05:01.734 --> 05:03.441
- Wait, you own it?
- Yeah, dude.

05:03.503 --> 05:05.505
Went to the bank, got a loan.

05:05.571 --> 05:07.517
- Pieces fell right into place.
- Huh.

05:07.573 --> 05:09.246
So what about you?
I thought you went to, uh...

05:09.309 --> 05:10.947
- MIT.
- MIT!

05:11.010 --> 05:14.583
Yeah. I just graduated.
But, uh, I hated it.

05:14.647 --> 05:16.820
Yeah, it was all, like,
theory and machines,

05:16.883 --> 05:18.829
and I was on this
one-way highway,

05:18.885 --> 05:21.798
and I was, like, you know,
"Rest stop, please!"

05:21.854 --> 05:24.767
So this is a rest stop?

05:24.824 --> 05:27.600
Oh, yeah, but this is totally temporary.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.697
You know what you should do?

05:29.762 --> 05:30.797
You should travel.

05:30.863 --> 05:33.537
See the world, find
your humpback whale.

05:33.599 --> 05:35.374
You come see me, OK?

05:35.435 --> 05:37.779
Seriously, it's a slow season right now.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.441
Everybody's at work or school.

05:39.505 --> 05:42.213
Perfect time for Matt to shine.

05:42.275 --> 05:43.845
You take care, man.

05:45.411 --> 05:47.152
Don't you forget it.

06:48.341 --> 06:50.412
- Excuse me.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

06:56.315 --> 06:57.851
Hey, don't I know you?

06:58.918 --> 07:00.192
I don't think so.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.199
No, I do. I know you from somewhere.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.325
Hmm...

07:04.524 --> 07:05.867
Oh, you went to Shermer,
didn't you?

07:05.925 --> 07:07.700
- I did! Oh, that must be it.
- Yes.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.262
- Yeah, me, too.
- Oh, weird.

07:09.328 --> 07:10.602
I actually think you were
in my homeroom.

07:10.663 --> 07:12.643
- What?
- Yeah.

07:12.698 --> 07:14.200
You're the really smart kid.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.541
Oh.

07:15.601 --> 07:17.877
You won the attendance award,
every year.

07:19.172 --> 07:21.413
- Yeah.
- It's me, Tori.

07:21.474 --> 07:22.612
Matt Franklin.

07:22.675 --> 07:24.484
I knew, I knew you from somewhere.

07:24.544 --> 07:25.750
Cool.

07:27.847 --> 07:30.487
So you... What are you up to?

07:30.550 --> 07:34.794
Well, uh, I went to Duke,
and I graduated, with honors.

07:34.854 --> 07:35.855
Ah.

07:35.922 --> 07:37.924
Yeah, and then I got
awarded this internship

07:37.990 --> 07:39.526
at Drexel Burnham, so...

07:39.592 --> 07:41.162
Well, I moved back.

07:41.227 --> 07:42.831
Oh, it's an investment bank.

07:42.895 --> 07:43.896
I know what it is.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.340
Oh, I didn't mean to...

07:45.398 --> 07:46.672
No, no, it's fine.

07:46.732 --> 07:48.575
Just, I'm in the same business, so...

07:48.634 --> 07:49.977
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:50.036 --> 07:51.481
Where do you work?

07:52.538 --> 07:54.142
I'm at Goldman Sachs.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.619
Oh, that's funny, I didn't know
they had an office in Los Angeles.

07:59.078 --> 08:01.388
I know, that's weird, uh...

08:01.447 --> 08:04.018
a lot of people don't.

08:05.284 --> 08:07.491
I'm in Japanese takeovers.

08:07.553 --> 08:09.123
Oh.

08:09.188 --> 08:12.829
So, are you going to
Kyle Masterson's party tonight?

08:12.892 --> 08:14.565
Uh, I don't know.

08:14.627 --> 08:17.540
Oh. You should totally go.
It was pretty good last year.

08:17.597 --> 08:20.043
Word is, someone's gonna ride
The Ball tonight.

08:23.035 --> 08:24.844
Where are they?

08:24.904 --> 08:26.178
Weird.

08:26.239 --> 08:29.686
Hello?

08:29.742 --> 08:31.346
No. Just take it. Just...

08:31.410 --> 08:33.356
Just take it. There we go.

08:33.412 --> 08:36.154
I'll pay for it
when this jackass gets back.

08:36.215 --> 08:37.956
Great. Thank you.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.998
So maybe I'll see you tonight...

08:41.053 --> 08:42.054
Teri?

08:42.121 --> 08:43.327
Tori.

08:43.389 --> 08:45.266
Right, Tori. Sorry.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.377
Barry Nathan.

08:55.434 --> 08:59.473
Dude, you are not gonna believe
who was just in here. Tori Frederking.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.847
Bottom line it for me.

09:00.907 --> 09:02.545
I think she was flirting with me.

09:02.608 --> 09:04.144
I honestly got that vibe.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.588
That's highly unlikely.
Can you do better for me, boss?

09:06.646 --> 09:10.560
She said I should totally go
to Kyle Masterson's party tonight.

09:10.616 --> 09:12.186
This is it. I finally have my in.

09:12.251 --> 09:14.356
- I see.
- We're going to that party.

09:14.420 --> 09:15.899
I'm finally getting her phone number.

09:15.955 --> 09:17.866
Yeah. That's all you got for me?

09:17.924 --> 09:20.336
Oh, yeah, right. What do you know
about investment banking?

09:20.393 --> 09:22.270
- Nothing.
- Currencies?

09:22.328 --> 09:25.605
Nothing? That's unacceptable.

09:25.665 --> 09:27.838
You gotta bend
a bit here more, boss.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.538
This guy just had another baby!

09:29.602 --> 09:31.240
Oh, you're trying to close a sale.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.841
Vagina, vagina, vagina, vagina,
vagina, vagina, vagina.

09:33.906 --> 09:35.681
Vagina.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.414
Good luck. We'll pick you up at five.

09:37.476 --> 09:38.955
Fine! No, I will!

09:39.011 --> 09:41.287
I'll take it
out of my own goddamn salary!

09:41.347 --> 09:44.692
Fine! No, thank you, it's a pleasure!

09:44.750 --> 09:46.730
Such a fucking pleasure!

09:46.786 --> 09:51.201
I'm sorry
that you had to witness that...

09:51.257 --> 09:53.396
Steven.

09:53.459 --> 09:55.268
That bastard's
not gonna budge, but, um,

09:55.328 --> 09:57.968
off the top of my head,
this is what I'm gonna do.

09:58.030 --> 10:01.807
I'm gonna knock three grand off.

10:03.402 --> 10:05.780
Your boss is standing right behind you.

10:07.106 --> 10:10.781
And I'm not buying
your bullshit... Barry.

10:10.843 --> 10:12.516
Or a sedan.

10:24.390 --> 10:26.836
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me.

10:26.892 --> 10:28.064
Fuck me.

10:38.804 --> 10:43.344
You know what? I gave up
college for you bastards!

10:49.315 --> 10:51.090
Oh, shit.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.720
- Start the engine!
- Oh, my God.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.428
- Oh, my God.
- Fuck you!

10:59.492 --> 11:02.132
So, um, Dad, somebody's
gonna ride The Ball tonight.

11:02.194 --> 11:03.935
Darling, nobody rode

11:03.996 --> 11:07.205
that thing when I was a kid,
and nobody's gonna ride it tonight.

11:07.266 --> 11:09.769
How's your dad doing, Barry?

11:09.835 --> 11:12.372
Well, his parole got
pushed back about six months,

11:12.438 --> 11:14.281
so he's pretty
upset about that.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.149
You know, I...

11:16.208 --> 11:18.950
still don't understand
why they let you go.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.825
Seven years of my life, Libby.

11:22.882 --> 11:24.225
They stole my youth.

11:24.817 --> 11:26.558
Well,
look at it this way, Barry.

11:26.619 --> 11:28.496
At least you went for it.

11:28.554 --> 11:30.727
You realized a goal,
you rolled up your sleeves

11:30.790 --> 11:32.326
and you applied yourself.

11:32.391 --> 11:33.995
Well, I see

11:34.060 --> 11:36.404
the traditional evening's
torture is in full swing.

11:38.130 --> 11:40.235
Matthew, we had a deal.

11:40.299 --> 11:42.711
You said, "Just give me
the summer to figure things out."

11:42.768 --> 11:46.511
Well, guess what. The summer's over.
I want to hear your plan.

11:46.572 --> 11:49.052
Dad, I guess my plan
is to keep working at Suncoast

11:49.108 --> 11:52.954
until I figure out what
I really want to do with my life.

11:53.012 --> 11:55.720
Why don't you just get an engineering
job until you figure it out?

11:55.781 --> 11:58.421
Honey, we just think
you have such potential.

11:58.484 --> 12:00.225
I mean, you could be anything.

12:00.286 --> 12:02.994
You could be an astronaut.

12:03.055 --> 12:06.400
Oh. Problem solved.
I'll just be an astronaut.

12:06.459 --> 12:07.938
Matthew,

12:07.993 --> 12:10.098
I didn't give a quarter
of my savings to MIT

12:10.162 --> 12:12.369
so you could work at the mall.

12:13.265 --> 12:16.803
I'll see you all in the morning.
I gotta go to work.

12:17.470 --> 12:18.847
Matt!

12:20.439 --> 12:21.713
Are you OK?

12:21.774 --> 12:23.776
I applied to Cambridge for my master's.

12:23.843 --> 12:26.187
Holy shit! You finally did it.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.225
- I don't want to open it.
- Why not?

12:28.280 --> 12:30.590
Because I'm scared, dipshit.

12:30.649 --> 12:32.424
Oh. Do you want me to open it?

12:32.485 --> 12:34.692
No! No, Matt. No! Knock it off!

12:34.754 --> 12:35.926
- I think you do.
- Don't.

12:35.988 --> 12:39.868
Wendy... You're going to England.

12:39.925 --> 12:42.371
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't even know if I'd go.

12:42.428 --> 12:43.463
Why?

12:43.529 --> 12:45.406
I don't know if Kyle would come or not.

12:45.464 --> 12:47.842
We take possession
of the condo on Tuesday.

12:47.900 --> 12:50.346
- His dad's put me in charge...
- Well, I mean, look, he'll visit.

12:50.402 --> 12:53.815
He needs to experience
a new language. Open it.

12:55.141 --> 12:58.145
I just applied
to see if I could get in.

12:59.178 --> 13:01.419
OK, Wendy, you know

13:01.480 --> 13:03.619
that I hate giving you
compliments, right?

13:04.250 --> 13:05.285
Yeah.

13:05.351 --> 13:07.422
I've read your short stories.

13:07.486 --> 13:08.760
They're amazing.

13:09.755 --> 13:11.166
I know.

13:11.223 --> 13:13.760
Open it. Open it.

13:13.826 --> 13:15.271
Open it.

13:15.327 --> 13:16.772
Fucking open it.

13:16.829 --> 13:18.137
- No!
- OK, OK...

13:18.197 --> 13:20.199
No, I'm not going to. No, not now.

13:20.266 --> 13:21.768
No, I just want to have fun tonight.

13:21.834 --> 13:25.577
Matt... don't tell
anyone. Promise.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.879
You can trust me.

13:27.940 --> 13:29.283
I'm a Goldman Sachs man.

13:29.341 --> 13:30.945
Good luck with that.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.352
OK, here we go.

13:38.417 --> 13:42.763
Nelson Mandela,
Purple Rain, windsurfing...

13:42.822 --> 13:44.824
- Windsurfing?
- Windsurfing?

13:45.724 --> 13:47.169
What am I doing?

13:47.226 --> 13:48.569
Whoa...

13:50.229 --> 13:51.765
I'll never get this girl.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.471
Hey, hey, hey...

13:54.533 --> 13:56.740
I don't want to hear that talk tonight.

13:56.802 --> 13:58.304
OK? How long do I know you?

13:58.370 --> 14:01.613
- Since fifth grade.
- Since fifth grade. That's right.

14:02.408 --> 14:04.012
You're whipping it real good now.

14:04.076 --> 14:07.455
Look at you. You're
the smartest guy I know.

14:07.513 --> 14:10.858
Your acne is all cleared up.

14:10.916 --> 14:12.862
- Yeah.
- Hey...

14:12.918 --> 14:15.728
You've had sex now.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.290
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:17.356 --> 14:20.303
I'm gonna be with you
every step of the way.

14:20.359 --> 14:24.171
You're gonna do this, Matt.
And you're gonna do it well.

14:25.764 --> 14:28.335
You're gonna get
this broad's number.

14:28.400 --> 14:31.279
Hey, great work today, you guys,
all right? Thank you very much.

14:31.337 --> 14:32.714
Good job today.

14:32.771 --> 14:35.115
Appreciate it.
Bien. Mucho.

14:35.174 --> 14:36.710
- Hey, Kyle. Kyle!
- Hey.

14:36.775 --> 14:38.220
Get these lights on.
Let's see what this looks like.

14:38.277 --> 14:39.950
Hey, watch, I'm
gonna school this bitch.

14:40.012 --> 14:42.390
Guys, get a beer. You're off the clock.
Hang out. Good job today.

14:42.448 --> 14:46.897
Oh! Stellar! That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

14:46.952 --> 14:48.454
We having a party here or what?

14:48.520 --> 14:50.500
Play that fucking music, white boy.

15:02.368 --> 15:05.212
Oh, if I didn't have a cast on,
I would school you little bitches.

15:49.148 --> 15:52.527
Oh, shit. I...
I can't show up in this car.

15:52.584 --> 15:54.586
- Why not?
- Uh...

15:54.653 --> 15:57.327
The Frederking does not roll
in a kumquat.

15:59.992 --> 16:02.734
Whoa. That's my graduation
bottle from MIT.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.274
Mm-hm.

16:04.330 --> 16:05.741
Come on, I was saving
that for something special.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.243
It's kind of special

16:07.299 --> 16:10.337
that I've never drunk
this much this fast before.

16:11.503 --> 16:13.414
Hey, listen,
you will get through this.

16:13.472 --> 16:17.614
Hey! I got fired today, OK?

16:17.676 --> 16:19.815
Fired.

16:19.878 --> 16:23.849
I didn't go to "screw all day
and drink all night" college,

16:23.916 --> 16:26.726
like you twin bastards did.

16:26.785 --> 16:29.231
Tonight, I'm catching up!

16:30.923 --> 16:32.869
Take a right at these lights up here.

16:32.925 --> 16:35.531
- Why?
- Take a right!

16:37.696 --> 16:38.936
I'm sorry.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.550
I'm having no part of this.

16:49.608 --> 16:54.216
Yeah, Barry, I'm a little fuzzy
on how we're gonna get away with this.

16:54.279 --> 16:56.225
I have a set of keys.

16:56.281 --> 16:57.885
I know all the alarm codes.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.328
It's almost perfectly legitimate.

17:01.387 --> 17:03.162
Almost.

17:04.490 --> 17:06.902
You just honk the horn
if anyone shows up.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.494
Roger that.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.595
Come on.

17:21.673 --> 17:25.519
Listen, Barry, I really don't want
to spend tonight in the LA County Jail,

17:25.577 --> 17:28.079
giving some white supremacist
a crying blowjob.

17:28.146 --> 17:30.650
That's not gonna happen, Matt.

17:30.716 --> 17:33.560
There's no way you'd cry.

17:33.619 --> 17:37.123
Look. Mike, the prick bastard
sales manager who fired me,

17:37.189 --> 17:41.569
keeps the keys to the 56OSL
in his prick bastard desk.

17:41.627 --> 17:43.732
Come on, come on, come on...

17:45.330 --> 17:46.502
I don't know, man.

17:46.565 --> 17:49.409
What? We're gonna bring it back later.
Nobody's gonna know the difference. OK?

17:49.468 --> 17:52.347
I don't know. What if someone sees us?
I think there might be security cameras.

17:52.404 --> 17:56.580
Matt, stop thinking. OK?
Tonight, we're just doing.

17:57.109 --> 18:00.147
- Shut off the alarm.
- No problem.

18:12.157 --> 18:15.070
Fuck!

18:15.127 --> 18:18.040
They changed the alarm codes, man.
Those bastards didn't trust me.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.407
I wonder why?

18:27.306 --> 18:29.684
Oh, my God. Holy fuck. This is great!

18:34.847 --> 18:35.882
Ah...

18:41.620 --> 18:44.430
You pussy! Get back in the game!

18:44.490 --> 18:45.560
Come on!

18:51.530 --> 18:54.204
Oh, God!

19:01.807 --> 19:04.185
Top down! Top down!

19:04.243 --> 19:05.916
What the hell is he doing?

19:10.782 --> 19:13.922
Woo!

19:19.925 --> 19:20.995
Test drive?

19:32.037 --> 19:34.608
- What the fuck? Holy shit!
- Woo!

19:34.673 --> 19:36.516
- Stole a car!
- Holy shit.

19:36.575 --> 19:39.112
- We stole a car!
- Barry, holy fucking shit.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.521
- Woo!
- Unbelievable.

19:45.350 --> 19:46.488
Woo!

19:46.552 --> 19:48.998
I've never driven a 56OSL before, Matt.

19:51.423 --> 19:53.096
They never let me.

19:54.626 --> 19:58.301
Uh, man...
Maybe you should take it back.

19:58.363 --> 20:02.038
No. You need this car tonight, Matt.

20:02.100 --> 20:03.977
You need this car tonight!

20:06.638 --> 20:08.515
- Woo-hoo-hoo!
- Woo!

20:38.704 --> 20:40.547
Oh, my God.

20:45.344 --> 20:48.518
Think your prick bastard boss
keeps a comb in here?

20:52.884 --> 20:53.885
Holy...

20:56.755 --> 20:58.564
Are you stupid?

21:03.795 --> 21:05.797
What is that finger thing?

21:05.864 --> 21:07.036
I don't know.

21:09.835 --> 21:11.815
Tastes like aspirin.

21:11.870 --> 21:13.645
My tongue is numb.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.842
Holy shit, Barry,
that was awesome!

21:16.908 --> 21:18.444
- Fantastic.
- Oh, my God.

21:21.513 --> 21:24.289
- Huh?
- My God!

21:29.921 --> 21:32.333
- Sunshine!
- Hammer pants!

21:34.660 --> 21:37.436
Hey. How's it goin', out-points?

21:37.496 --> 21:39.840
Hey, did you two manage
to fuck each other yet?

21:40.799 --> 21:42.005
- What?
- What?

21:42.067 --> 21:45.048
Oh, shit! Matt! Matt Franklin!

21:45.103 --> 21:48.084
And, uh... your buddy you're
always hanging out with.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.949
What's up? You never make
these things, man!

21:50.008 --> 21:51.817
So that's The Ball.

21:51.877 --> 21:54.483
In person, live, via satellite!

21:54.546 --> 21:56.856
You know, it's not "via" anything.

21:56.915 --> 21:58.360
- it's right here.
- Yeah, you get the point.

21:58.417 --> 22:00.055
I don't think he knows
what "via" means.

22:00.118 --> 22:01.358
- Fuck you. Drop it. Right now.
- Or "satellite."

22:01.420 --> 22:02.160
I hate you.

22:02.220 --> 22:03.494
Wendy, get up here.

22:03.555 --> 22:04.625
- Come on, baby.
- Oh...

22:04.690 --> 22:06.431
Get your hot ass up here
and give me a kiss.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.334
- Be careful.
- It's amazing.

22:08.393 --> 22:10.805
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:10.862 --> 22:12.933
Oh, sorry.

22:12.998 --> 22:15.604
- ...totally bogus.
- OK, Matt. Share with everybody.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.203
- Nothing.
- Go ahead. What?

22:17.269 --> 22:18.509
What were you saying?

22:18.570 --> 22:20.174
This looks suicidal, man.

22:20.238 --> 22:21.581
Come on. You just don't like it

22:21.640 --> 22:23.745
because The Ball represents balls,
which you don't have.

22:23.809 --> 22:25.186
Kyle...

22:25.243 --> 22:28.053
Oh, is this one
of those met-o-phors?

22:28.113 --> 22:31.492
- Matt...
- Wendy, no, I got this one.

22:31.550 --> 22:33.552
Yeah. Yeah, that's a metaphor.

22:33.618 --> 22:38.294
So The Ball, is... balls.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.098
Yeah!

22:40.892 --> 22:42.269
Good one.

22:45.130 --> 22:46.632
- This is wrong.
- That is a metaphor.

22:46.698 --> 22:47.699
I totally got him.

23:16.795 --> 23:19.275
Oh, my God!
Exclamation point!

23:19.331 --> 23:23.575
Graham Franklin!

23:23.635 --> 23:26.047
Do not go anywhere!

23:34.413 --> 23:36.324
Nice shades, asshole!

23:38.183 --> 23:41.426
Well, no sign of The Frederking.

23:41.486 --> 23:43.090
Yeah.

23:43.155 --> 23:45.897
Man, I feel like
I'm in tenth grade again.

23:45.957 --> 23:47.732
I'm gonna put these on ice.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.374
Hey, Franklin!

23:51.430 --> 23:53.706
- Down here, Han Solo.
- Aah! Fuck!

23:53.765 --> 23:55.745
Carlos?
What happened to you?

23:55.801 --> 23:57.610
Sixty-seven times 365.

23:57.669 --> 23:59.410
- You're in a wheelchair.
- Answer.

23:59.471 --> 24:01.917
Twenty-four thousand, four-hundred
and fifty-five. What's up?

24:01.973 --> 24:04.180
I've been really lazy.
No, I'm just kidding.

24:04.242 --> 24:06.051
I got hit by a drunk driver
right after graduation.

24:06.111 --> 24:07.613
But don't cry for me, Argentina.

24:07.679 --> 24:10.387
It's not so bad.
I get better parking, tons of pussy.

24:10.449 --> 24:13.726
I mean, I have stronger opinions
about hills now, but whatever.

24:13.785 --> 24:15.594
So what have you been doing?
Building jet packs?

24:15.654 --> 24:17.895
Uh, no, I work at Goldman Sachs.

24:17.956 --> 24:19.458
No you don't. No way you work there.

24:19.524 --> 24:22.164
No, I do. I work in Asian takeovers.

24:22.227 --> 24:25.333
That's funny,
'cause you know where I work?

24:25.397 --> 24:27.104
Goldman fucking Sachs.
You don't work there.

24:27.165 --> 24:28.667
You work at Goldman Sachs?

24:28.733 --> 24:30.508
You bet your legs I do.

24:30.569 --> 24:32.674
Think I'm gonna let
this shit hold me back?

24:32.737 --> 24:34.580
You don't need to walk
to speculate currencies.

24:34.639 --> 24:38.177
I said, you don't need to walk
to speculate currencies!

24:38.243 --> 24:41.417
I'm doing what I want.
I'm following my dream. Eat it.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.959
I thought you wanted to play baseball.

24:43.014 --> 24:44.516
Fuck you, Franklin.

24:44.583 --> 24:47.029
Uh... Look, do you know Tori Frederking?

24:47.085 --> 24:48.587
Yeah, I know her.

24:48.653 --> 24:50.064
Well, if you see her,
could you show her this,

24:50.121 --> 24:52.624
and tell her I work at Goldman Sachs?

24:52.691 --> 24:55.228
Wow, that's pathetic, dude.

24:55.293 --> 24:57.432
Probably not gonna work, either.
We don't have an LA office.

24:57.496 --> 25:00.204
Everybody knows that
who has half a sack. Spelled with a K.

25:00.265 --> 25:02.245
Well, just, you know, don't rat me out.

25:02.300 --> 25:04.837
Yeah, I'll think about it.
If I'm not getting laid.

25:04.903 --> 25:06.541
When I'm getting laid,
I don't think about much else.

25:06.605 --> 25:09.176
Anyway, I'm kind of getting
bummed out, talking to you.

25:09.241 --> 25:11.653
What do you do, anyway?
Thought you went to MIT.

25:11.710 --> 25:13.781
I work at Suncoast Video.

25:13.845 --> 25:16.052
Wow.

25:16.114 --> 25:19.357
Congratulations?
Mom and dad must be psyched.

25:19.417 --> 25:22.887
I'm gonna get outta here.
Check this out. Moonwalk.

25:22.954 --> 25:26.197
Could you guys move?
I'm trying to fucking party here.

25:26.258 --> 25:29.603
And it's Kyle's crazy grandma
standing there,

25:29.661 --> 25:31.197
and she says... Listen to this.

25:31.263 --> 25:34.540
"l can't tell if you're
fucking or drowning,

25:34.599 --> 25:36.636
but neither one is
letting me get any sleep!"

25:38.003 --> 25:40.244
So embarrassing!

25:40.305 --> 25:44.117
And so next day,
my dad pulls me aside,

25:44.175 --> 25:46.781
and he offers to help with
the down payment on the condo.

25:46.845 --> 25:48.654
Yeah. So, you know,

25:48.713 --> 25:50.954
I guess we screwed
ourselves into the market.

25:53.385 --> 25:55.991
- it's... But it's true.
- Literally.

25:58.056 --> 26:00.229
- Hey.
- Hi.

26:00.292 --> 26:03.364
Yeah. Anyway, so we're moving in
on Tuesday, and...

26:03.428 --> 26:05.305
But it's great,
'cause the place has a hot tub,

26:05.363 --> 26:07.343
- and it has a great kitchen...
- Oh, it's beautiful.

26:07.399 --> 26:10.141
It's all black ivory...

26:22.747 --> 26:24.818
Hi. I can't handle this right now.

26:24.883 --> 26:26.226
I want to do some of the coke.

26:26.284 --> 26:27.957
What do you mean
you can't handle this?

26:28.019 --> 26:30.863
- I want to do the coke.
- No, what can't you handle?

26:30.922 --> 26:32.230
Not doing the coke.

26:32.290 --> 26:34.964
OK, Barry, we're not cocaine people.

26:35.026 --> 26:36.801
A, my dad's a cop.

26:36.861 --> 26:39.341
B, I'm defining my gray area,

26:39.397 --> 26:42.105
which I'm pretty sure
doesn't include hard narcotics.

26:42.167 --> 26:44.147
- Give me the bag.
- No.

26:44.202 --> 26:45.613
Give me the bag
or you don't get the car keys.

26:49.140 --> 26:52.883
All right, just take it easy, Scarf ace.

26:52.944 --> 26:54.924
This one here is an alarm...

27:36.855 --> 27:37.925
Tori Frederking?

27:37.989 --> 27:39.400
Rick Herrington!

27:39.457 --> 27:41.698
- Oh, my God!
- How are you?

27:41.760 --> 27:44.172
I am so good! Wow!

27:44.229 --> 27:46.505
You look... Oh!

27:46.564 --> 27:49.568
Wow, good, good.

27:49.634 --> 27:52.547
- Hey!
- Hey! How are you?

27:52.604 --> 27:55.084
- Richard, Rick.
- What's up, man?

27:55.140 --> 27:56.118
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

27:56.174 --> 27:57.152
How are you?

27:57.208 --> 27:58.983
Good, you know,
we're just packing up.

27:59.044 --> 28:00.819
We're moving in together
next week, so...

28:00.879 --> 28:02.756
- Oh, wow.
- We got a condo.

28:02.814 --> 28:04.054
Baby, tell 'em the story.

28:04.115 --> 28:05.685
We're here Fourth of July.

28:05.750 --> 28:07.593
You know, my family always
has the big party here,

28:07.652 --> 28:09.427
and, uh, the house is packed
with relatives,

28:09.487 --> 28:11.489
and so there's no place for us to...

28:11.556 --> 28:13.194
- I know.
- You know.

28:13.258 --> 28:15.431
So we come down to the pool,

28:15.493 --> 28:16.836
where it's always kind of quiet, right?

28:16.895 --> 28:19.375
And we're, you know,
getting into it before long,

28:19.431 --> 28:21.672
- water splashing, I'm...
- So embarrassing.

28:21.733 --> 28:24.873
Out of nowhere, a floatation ring
hits me in the head.

28:24.936 --> 28:27.177
And I'm, like, mid-pump.
I was like, "What?"

28:27.238 --> 28:31.983
And I look, and it's my crazy
grandmother, and she says to me,

28:32.043 --> 28:34.990
"l can't tell if you're
fucking or drowning,

28:35.046 --> 28:37.390
but neither one
is letting us get any sleep."

28:37.449 --> 28:39.759
Next day, Dad pulls us aside

28:39.818 --> 28:41.525
and offers to help with
the down payment on the condo.

28:41.586 --> 28:45.329
Yeah, so I guess we screwed
ourselves into the market.

28:45.390 --> 28:47.961
Oh!

28:53.031 --> 28:54.237
That was good.

28:54.599 --> 28:57.170
Hey, Matt, you remember Tori.

28:57.235 --> 28:59.442
- Whoa! Yes! Weird.
- Hi.

28:59.504 --> 29:02.280
How's it going? Mark?

29:02.340 --> 29:05.082
Oh, very funny.

29:05.143 --> 29:06.247
It's Matt...

29:07.712 --> 29:11.285
is my name.

29:14.552 --> 29:16.862
So... High school again, huh?

29:16.921 --> 29:18.400
Freaky deaky.

29:21.025 --> 29:23.904
- How's that?
- How...?

29:27.098 --> 29:30.841
Wow, this breeze is great.

29:30.902 --> 29:34.475
It's like... windsurfing weather.
You know?

29:34.539 --> 29:38.646
I'll tell you, I'd love to be
out on my board tonight.

29:38.710 --> 29:41.486
- You're into windsurfing?
- Mm. Hell yeah.

29:41.546 --> 29:44.220
Oh, yeah, big time. You?

29:44.282 --> 29:45.522
No, I'm not.

29:47.051 --> 29:48.530
Really?

29:48.586 --> 29:50.293
No.

29:51.156 --> 29:53.932
Yeah, no, well, 'cause... wind?

29:56.294 --> 29:57.602
Fuck that.

29:58.763 --> 30:00.868
Um, I should probably
go check to make sure

30:00.932 --> 30:03.105
we're not running
out of soda inside.

30:03.168 --> 30:04.511
So I'll see you guys later.

30:04.569 --> 30:05.513
I'll come with you.

30:05.570 --> 30:06.776
- All right.
- Rick, good seeing you.

30:06.838 --> 30:08.818
See you.

30:11.075 --> 30:14.887
- You know, it's funny...
- Hey, you ever find yourself in Paris?

30:14.946 --> 30:16.857
Uh... Yeah, actually.

30:16.915 --> 30:18.758
Yeah? There's a...

30:18.817 --> 30:21.764
a lovely bistro right around
the corner from the Sorbonne

30:21.820 --> 30:24.528
- called The Entrepôt.
- Oh...

30:24.589 --> 30:27.069
Its chèvre chaud is impeccable.

30:27.125 --> 30:30.402
- When were you there?
- I got back three...

30:31.062 --> 30:33.303
You are doing cocaine.

30:34.866 --> 30:36.470
OK...

30:36.534 --> 30:38.070
Oh, my God.

30:41.239 --> 30:42.684
Looks so easy in the movies.

30:43.341 --> 30:45.150
Let's do this.

30:45.210 --> 30:46.314
You're gonna do this.

30:46.377 --> 30:49.290
OK? You get off a banana boat?

30:50.348 --> 30:53.022
Nostrils ready. We're doing this.

30:53.084 --> 30:54.222
OK.

30:57.555 --> 30:59.660
OK.

31:15.940 --> 31:17.214
Nice.

31:19.944 --> 31:22.925
Great. I get stuck with a bag of shit.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.170
Blammo.

31:36.694 --> 31:38.731
Woo!

31:42.066 --> 31:44.239
Ooh!

32:08.693 --> 32:10.730
Hey! You're hot!

32:13.965 --> 32:15.444
I'm growling at you!

32:15.500 --> 32:17.878
Did you hear me? I was
growling at you like a lion!

32:17.936 --> 32:20.041
A lion in the jungle!

32:20.104 --> 32:21.378
I'm Barry!

32:23.641 --> 32:26.087
Confirmation.
Yeah, you're hot!

32:26.144 --> 32:29.648
- What?
- Hello!

32:29.714 --> 32:34.254
Uh! Red sash,
shoulder pads, zipper!

32:34.319 --> 32:36.299
You're tall!

32:36.354 --> 32:39.096
But I can still hear you!

32:39.157 --> 32:41.967
Whoa! You're gonna hurt
somebody, man!

32:42.026 --> 32:44.131
You're gonna take
someone's eye out!

32:44.195 --> 32:45.902
That guy's my boyfriend.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.807
Hope he screws better
than he dances, huh?

32:47.865 --> 32:51.403
Wait a minute. Oh, shit,
he's about to do the splits!

32:51.469 --> 32:54.348
I can see it in his eyes!
There he goes!

32:54.405 --> 32:56.908
He's got no testes left!

32:56.975 --> 32:59.353
He's got no testes left! Come on!

32:59.410 --> 33:01.412
Who's got a watermelon?

33:01.479 --> 33:03.083
Yo, yo, yo, yo!

33:03.147 --> 33:04.854
Yo. Go find your own date, boy!

33:04.916 --> 33:07.692
Oh, oh, oh,
I got my own date, boy!

33:07.752 --> 33:09.698
I think that you
used to know her. What!

33:16.794 --> 33:19.741
Yeah, what's up?
You wanna dance? Let's go.

33:19.797 --> 33:21.572
Let's see what you got, boy!

33:23.034 --> 33:26.174
Oh, yeah.

33:28.940 --> 33:31.614
Take a good look around you.

33:31.676 --> 33:34.748
Everything changes,
but nothing "changes."

33:34.812 --> 33:36.450
Yeah, I hear you, Broder.

33:36.514 --> 33:38.289
Honestly...

33:38.349 --> 33:41.387
So anyway, I've been getting
into this whole wine thing lately.

33:41.452 --> 33:44.661
Tasting it and talking
about it...

33:44.722 --> 33:47.225
We should go down
on my dad's boat

33:47.291 --> 33:48.634
and do a little sampling.

33:48.693 --> 33:51.230
Oh, hey!

33:51.863 --> 33:53.069
There you are!

33:53.131 --> 33:56.078
Matt? Hello?

33:56.134 --> 33:59.206
Weren't you gonna
show me that thing?

33:59.270 --> 34:01.614
- Right, the... waterfall.
- Yes!

34:01.672 --> 34:03.674
You see it on the other side
of the patio. I'll show you now.

34:03.741 --> 34:05.516
- I love waterfalls.
- Oh, great.

34:05.576 --> 34:07.681
OK, I will just be back in a bit.

34:12.784 --> 34:13.819
- How do you like that?
- That was awesome.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.387
- It was really good.
- Yeah.

34:15.453 --> 34:17.228
- I've got goose bumps.
- I know.

34:17.288 --> 34:18.960
- I love your sweater.
- Thanks.

34:19.623 --> 34:21.967
So...

34:23.594 --> 34:26.268
Those waterfalls,
I was... you know.

34:26.330 --> 34:27.900
There's no waterfalls.

34:27.965 --> 34:29.774
I know.

34:29.833 --> 34:32.440
Right.

34:32.503 --> 34:34.346
Have you seen Niagara?

34:34.405 --> 34:36.612
No, I haven't. Have you?

34:38.443 --> 34:39.751
No.

34:41.612 --> 34:43.455
Hey, Tori, uh...

34:46.350 --> 34:48.956
- You...
- Hey! Everybody!

34:49.020 --> 34:52.489
Barry Nathan and Tyler Cummings
are having a dance-off!

34:52.556 --> 34:54.331
Yeah!

34:55.126 --> 34:56.969
Cool.

34:57.027 --> 34:59.235
But I am,
my ridiculously dressed friend.

34:59.297 --> 35:02.278
I am in downtown Tokyo.
I am the samurai dance master,

35:02.333 --> 35:04.711
and I'm gonna dance your
demi-plié-ing ass into the ground!

35:04.769 --> 35:06.442
Yo, DJ! Hit it!

35:06.504 --> 35:09.144
- Yeah!

35:24.422 --> 35:26.231
Wow. He's amazing.

35:26.290 --> 35:28.201
Woo!

35:34.198 --> 35:36.337
Whoa! Yeah! Woo-hoo!

35:36.400 --> 35:38.141
That's all you got?

35:56.487 --> 35:57.591
Watch out!

36:05.830 --> 36:08.106
Woo! Yeah!

36:12.904 --> 36:13.905
Yeah!

36:20.244 --> 36:21.052
Boo!

36:27.618 --> 36:30.724
Hey, you had enough?
You had enough?

36:34.091 --> 36:36.230
Oh...

36:36.294 --> 36:37.898
Fuckin' A, Barry.

36:37.962 --> 36:40.101
I got you, bitch!

36:42.700 --> 36:43.838
Barry... Come on!

36:45.436 --> 36:46.972
Stop, stop, stop!
Broder, come on.

36:47.038 --> 36:48.517
- OK. Cool, cool.
- Chill out. All right?

36:49.907 --> 36:53.354
I can take the punches.
Let's see you, boy!

36:53.411 --> 36:56.392
Come on, you guys. Come on,
you guys, we are adults!

36:56.447 --> 36:59.690
All right, fine, fine, fine! It's over.

36:59.750 --> 37:02.026
Don't do it again, white boy. Here.

37:02.086 --> 37:04.498
Goddamn it, Barry.

37:10.895 --> 37:11.999
Are you OK?

37:12.063 --> 37:13.940
Oh, my God, she's choking!
Somebody help her!

37:16.400 --> 37:19.040
I got her! I got you!

37:19.103 --> 37:20.980
Breathe! Breathe!

37:21.038 --> 37:23.075
- Get off her, you freak!
- Back off!

37:23.140 --> 37:25.211
You're gonna pull through!
Come on, breathe!

37:25.276 --> 37:27.017
What are you doing?

37:27.078 --> 37:28.785
I'm giving you the Heimlich.

37:28.846 --> 37:31.554
I wasn't choking! She was!

37:38.923 --> 37:40.334
Is she all right?

37:43.427 --> 37:45.600
I'm such a jackass, I'm sorry.

37:47.098 --> 37:49.203
I suck at this! I'm... I'm...

37:49.267 --> 37:52.646
I don't... What am I doing?
I'm sorry. You're awesome.

37:52.703 --> 37:54.307
I'm, like, trying so hard

37:54.372 --> 37:56.648
and I... it's... Here's the thing.

37:56.707 --> 37:58.687
You were my high school
crush, by the way,

37:58.743 --> 38:01.656
and I just physically assaulted you
in front of a bunch of people.

38:01.779 --> 38:04.020
I just hit rock-bottom, so...

38:04.081 --> 38:06.027
- Don't mind me.
- Really?

38:06.083 --> 38:08.461
Oh, yeah. I don't see how
it could get any worse.

38:08.519 --> 38:11.432
Nope. Got it.
I could ask you to dance

38:11.489 --> 38:13.662
and chuck my drink in your face

38:13.724 --> 38:15.328
and twirl you
into the fucking wall.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.940
I'll do it.

38:17.995 --> 38:19.440
I'm sorry. I was...

38:21.699 --> 38:23.440
Oh, I love this song.

38:27.705 --> 38:29.241
I love this song.

38:31.275 --> 38:34.085
Do you want to...
Do you want to dance?

38:34.145 --> 38:36.648
- Sure.
- Are you insured?

38:37.882 --> 38:41.056
I will dance with you
if you promise no twirling.

38:41.118 --> 38:43.564
Right. I promise. I'll go slow.

39:06.210 --> 39:08.816
I was wondering if
I could get your phone...

39:08.879 --> 39:10.586
What?

39:11.882 --> 39:14.021
I was wondering if I could...

39:14.085 --> 39:17.498
I could, uh... could...

39:17.555 --> 39:20.468
I could always tell
in high school, um,

39:20.524 --> 39:21.935
that you were gonna
land on your feet.

39:27.298 --> 39:29.539
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I can get your attention, please.

39:31.035 --> 39:33.879
OK. Really? All right. Um...

39:33.938 --> 39:35.940
First of all, I want to say
thank you to everybody

39:36.006 --> 39:39.453
for chilling with me
at my very last Labor Day party!

39:42.480 --> 39:45.086
Yeah. You know, a lot of things
have changed, it seems like,

39:45.149 --> 39:46.992
since we graduated.
Trevor, talking to you.

39:47.051 --> 39:49.122
What's up with that
fucking earring, dude?

39:51.155 --> 39:53.658
We are changing, and we're moving on.

39:53.724 --> 39:55.294
We're going our separate ways.

39:55.359 --> 40:00.365
And... some of us are going
our separate ways together.

40:00.431 --> 40:03.002
You all know Wendy.
Wendy Franklin, here.

40:03.067 --> 40:05.013
- Honey, get on up here.
- What are you doing?

40:05.069 --> 40:06.275
What is he doing?

40:10.374 --> 40:11.910
Um...

40:11.976 --> 40:14.923
I think that she is
one hell of a chick...

40:15.713 --> 40:20.458
because she turned a lump
of coal like me into a diamond.

40:20.518 --> 40:21.895
Aw...

40:21.952 --> 40:24.558
From all the pressure
she put me under. Oh!

40:27.558 --> 40:29.902
Oh, wait, there's
something in my pocket.

40:32.997 --> 40:34.305
Oh, my God.

40:34.365 --> 40:36.174
Oh, my God.

40:37.701 --> 40:40.045
Wendy, will you many me?

40:40.104 --> 40:43.347
Oh...

40:47.211 --> 40:49.452
- No!
- Hell, yeah!

40:53.984 --> 40:55.964
Yes! Yes, I will.

41:22.046 --> 41:23.821
Oh, man, come on!

41:31.021 --> 41:32.762
Shit!

41:54.378 --> 41:56.654
- Hey.
- Hey... Hey.

41:56.714 --> 41:58.455
Look, I know everyone's
making fun of you,

41:58.516 --> 42:00.120
but... I just wanted to say,

42:00.184 --> 42:01.720
I really love what you did
out there tonight.

42:01.785 --> 42:03.492
Who's making fun of me?

42:03.554 --> 42:04.726
Don't worry about it.

42:04.788 --> 42:08.463
Your dance was cool.
It was, like... anti-dancing.

42:11.962 --> 42:14.909
It's like a big "screw you"
to all them conformist assholes.

42:14.965 --> 42:16.638
I'm glad you liked it.

42:16.700 --> 42:18.737
You didn't give a shit
about any of their shit.

42:18.802 --> 42:21.248
You know?

42:21.305 --> 42:22.978
Did you want to get naked?

42:23.040 --> 42:26.317
Wow. That was fast.

42:26.377 --> 42:28.983
Even for me,
and I get naked all the time.

42:29.046 --> 42:30.389
Yeah.

42:33.651 --> 42:35.289
Come find me later.

42:46.196 --> 42:47.539
Hey.

42:47.598 --> 42:49.600
Could I talk to you for a sec?

42:52.469 --> 42:53.948
I don't want to say this,
but I really feel...

42:54.004 --> 42:55.847
- Then don't. Don't.
- Don't many him.

42:55.906 --> 42:58.648
- Oh, Christ.
- The two of you...

42:58.709 --> 43:01.690
it's like, you don't fit.
I don't think he can make you happy.

43:01.745 --> 43:04.692
Well, I already am happy, so
you're wrong, so leave me alone.

43:04.748 --> 43:06.785
Then why won't you open
that envelope from Cambridge?

43:06.850 --> 43:08.921
Because I hate rejection, Matt.

43:08.986 --> 43:10.260
No, come on, you know you got in.

43:10.321 --> 43:12.528
And you know he doesn't want you to go.
He's already holding you back.

43:12.590 --> 43:15.434
Kyle would support any decision that I
wanted to make as long as I was happy.

43:15.492 --> 43:17.403
OK, then why didn't
you tell him you applied?

43:17.461 --> 43:19.270
I mean, he's gonna be
your husband, right?

43:19.330 --> 43:21.139
Aren't you supposed to be honest
with him about everything?

43:21.198 --> 43:24.042
You're lecturing me
about honesty, Mr. Goldman Sachs?

43:24.101 --> 43:26.707
Only reason you're saying all
this stuff is 'cause you're jealous.

43:26.770 --> 43:28.511
You're jealous that I have
a life and you don't.

43:28.572 --> 43:29.607
You're not gonna have a life.

43:29.673 --> 43:31.710
You're just gonna play
a supporting role in Kyle's life.

43:31.775 --> 43:33.982
That's why you said yes, right? So
it'll all be wrapped up in a little bow?

43:34.044 --> 43:35.455
Wendy, marriage is
a big life decision.

43:35.512 --> 43:39.050
Big life decisions? At least
I'm making some, asshole!

43:39.116 --> 43:40.993
You're so scared,
you can't choose anything!

43:41.051 --> 43:42.928
Not a girl, not a job, anything!

43:42.987 --> 43:46.332
And you're just gonna sit there in
your little smarty-pants fantasy bubble,

43:46.390 --> 43:49.564
dreaming about Tori Frederking,
when you know that she's unobtainable!

43:49.627 --> 43:50.833
That's not true.

43:50.894 --> 43:52.373
You can't get her
and you know it.

43:52.429 --> 43:54.306
So there's really
no risk at all, is there?

43:54.365 --> 43:56.606
It's bullshit, Matt,
and you know it.

43:59.370 --> 44:00.678
I was wrong.

44:01.805 --> 44:03.546
You're gonna look great in an apron.

44:23.594 --> 44:27.701
Ta-da! So you know how
I've always been into fashion?

44:27.765 --> 44:30.041
- Yes.
- Well, I am moving to New York.

44:30.100 --> 44:33.479
Doesn't that so blow your mind?

44:33.537 --> 44:34.709
- Totally.
- Yeah.

44:34.772 --> 44:36.683
Let's go over
the hill to the Drexel party.

44:36.740 --> 44:38.549
Why are we still hanging out
with a bunch of slobs?

44:38.609 --> 44:40.555
Some of us weren't
offered full-time positions.

44:40.611 --> 44:42.488
I have some serious
networking to do.

44:42.546 --> 44:44.719
This is so totally not me. OK...

44:44.782 --> 44:47.262
I totally think we could
work something out.

44:47.317 --> 44:48.489
Just for tonight.

44:49.286 --> 44:50.321
- Shelly?
- Yeah?

44:50.387 --> 44:51.730
I gotta go.

44:52.923 --> 44:55.494
I totally don't know
what I'm talking about.

45:13.143 --> 45:14.850
Is that your car?

45:15.546 --> 45:17.355
What? Oh...

45:17.414 --> 45:19.291
Wow, that is so cherry.

45:19.349 --> 45:21.420
You already make enough money
for a car like this?

45:21.485 --> 45:23.590
Well, you know...

45:23.654 --> 45:25.759
Nobody stopped me
when I drove it off the lot.

45:26.490 --> 45:29.471
Matt! Matt! OW!

45:29.526 --> 45:32.268
Matt! Matt!

45:33.897 --> 45:34.932
This is Barry...

45:34.998 --> 45:36.409
Oh.

45:36.467 --> 45:38.913
The dancer.

45:40.838 --> 45:43.785
So are you guys going
to that party in Beverly Hills?

45:43.841 --> 45:45.582
Uh, yeah, or...

45:45.642 --> 45:48.418
We were thinking about it.

45:48.479 --> 45:49.958
- You?
- Yeah.

45:51.949 --> 45:54.327
Where is that party again?

45:54.384 --> 45:56.159
You know what?
I know the way,

45:56.220 --> 45:59.099
so I should just...
ride with you.

45:59.156 --> 46:01.227
- What?
- Oh, my God, you slut.

46:03.827 --> 46:05.397
"Oh, my God, you slut."

46:05.462 --> 46:06.964
Look, you gotta ride
with her friends.

46:07.030 --> 46:09.032
Really? OK.

46:10.067 --> 46:11.478
Are you smoking now?

46:12.970 --> 46:14.677
When it rains, it pours.

46:14.738 --> 46:17.742
Am I right, brother?

46:17.808 --> 46:19.344
Come on. Punch it up.

46:19.409 --> 46:20.479
- Punch.
- What are you...?

46:20.544 --> 46:22.148
And squeeze real tight.

46:22.212 --> 46:24.123
And then the finger comes up. Bam!

46:24.181 --> 46:26.161
- And then you go like this...
- Get off of me.

46:29.486 --> 46:33.400
Hey, hey, hey. I guess
I'm riding with you guys.

46:33.457 --> 46:36.267
Uh... I don't know.

46:36.326 --> 46:37.999
I have cocaine on me.

46:39.696 --> 46:41.073
Can I ride in the back
with you, Barry?

46:41.131 --> 46:43.338
Yeah. Sweet night.

46:44.802 --> 46:45.803
Well, this'll be fun.

46:45.869 --> 46:49.339
It'll be all bankers at this party,
so we will know a ton of people.

46:49.406 --> 46:52.785
Oh... Great.

47:25.008 --> 47:26.817
it's a great night for this, huh?

47:26.877 --> 47:28.823
Yeah.

47:31.982 --> 47:35.452
So this party is at my boss,
Pete Bering's house.

47:35.519 --> 47:38.898
Unfortunately, he's a bit of a pew.

47:38.956 --> 47:42.165
Swear to God, the only reason I got
offered a full-time position at Drexel

47:42.226 --> 47:44.672
is 'cause he wants to see my boobs.

47:44.728 --> 47:46.867
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

47:46.930 --> 47:48.409
What about your friends' boobs?

47:48.465 --> 47:50.069
Well, he's already seen them.

47:50.133 --> 47:52.238
- Really? Wow.
- Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

47:52.302 --> 47:53.940
You see, that's the problem.

47:54.004 --> 47:56.780
Boob power recedes,
once revealed.

47:56.840 --> 48:00.811
He hasn't, and won't see mine,
so... I retain the boob power.

48:00.878 --> 48:03.051
Eye contact, Matt.

48:05.549 --> 48:08.325
You know, we always know
when you guys look.

48:08.385 --> 48:09.693
Not always.

48:09.753 --> 48:11.426
No, we do. It's true.

48:11.488 --> 48:14.264
Go ahead. Give it a shot.
I'll look away.

48:14.758 --> 48:16.499
OK.

48:19.062 --> 48:21.542
- Now.
- Wow... Whoa.

48:21.598 --> 48:23.100
That was...
That was good.

48:23.166 --> 48:24.474
Pretty good?

48:25.969 --> 48:27.971
- Now.
- Wow.

48:28.038 --> 48:30.040
That's crazy. I don't know.
Maybe... I think...

48:30.107 --> 48:31.518
Maybe like you're
just getting lucky.

48:31.575 --> 48:33.612
Oh, really?
Try it again, big shot.

48:33.677 --> 48:35.156
OK.

48:36.947 --> 48:38.585
- Now.
- Wow, that is a gift.

48:39.383 --> 48:41.056
That's unbelievable.

48:42.152 --> 48:43.859
Best of seven?

49:06.944 --> 49:08.719
Hey.

49:08.779 --> 49:11.123
Holy shit, did you see that car?

49:36.907 --> 49:38.250
Hey!

49:38.308 --> 49:41.016
- There they are.
- How are you guys?

49:48.552 --> 49:49.758
It'll cause the stock to rally.

49:49.820 --> 49:51.731
But I'm worried about them
sustaining these margins.

49:51.788 --> 49:53.233
The rumors about this
Russian oil field...

49:53.290 --> 49:54.997
it's going to happen
because it's got momentum.

49:55.058 --> 49:56.935
But you can't put momentum
on a balance sheet.

49:56.994 --> 49:58.803
I mean, their numbers
are embarrassing.

49:58.862 --> 50:01.035
That's irrelevant. We'll float
some junk and then they can buy

50:01.098 --> 50:04.272
a company with a balance sheet
that's not absolute shit.

50:04.334 --> 50:06.871
Walter, you're not drinking.
I warned you about that.

50:06.937 --> 50:09.042
Excuse me.
Hello, Tori.

50:09.106 --> 50:11.677
- Hey, Mr. Bering.
- Hey, it's Pete. Please.

50:11.742 --> 50:14.416
I was really hoping you'd come.
Walk with me.

50:14.478 --> 50:15.718
Excuse me.

50:16.880 --> 50:18.985
- I think Beth's here.
- Didn't notice.

50:19.049 --> 50:21.996
Listen, Tori, I was hoping
to get your opinion

50:22.052 --> 50:25.795
on the actualities
of that Baltic sterling nonsense.

50:26.523 --> 50:28.025
Would you mind coming upstairs,

50:28.091 --> 50:31.038
take a look at that report,
decode it for me?

50:31.094 --> 50:33.574
It's Pete, right?

50:33.630 --> 50:34.836
Pete Bering.

50:34.898 --> 50:37.310
Matt Franklin.

50:37.367 --> 50:40.041
- Good to see you again.
- I'm sorry, have we met?

50:40.103 --> 50:42.947
Have we met?

50:47.544 --> 50:52.050
- Oh...
- Matt's over at Goldman Sachs.

50:52.115 --> 50:54.095
Guilty as charged.

50:54.151 --> 50:57.325
So, Matt... Who do you
work under over there?

50:57.387 --> 50:59.765
Oh, well, I'm not at liberty to say.

50:59.823 --> 51:01.063
Why not?

51:01.124 --> 51:03.104
Well, we pride ourselves
as being a very discreet firm,

51:03.160 --> 51:05.731
so our policy is
don't discuss business.

51:05.796 --> 51:08.970
Really? Matt doesn't seem like
a Goldman Sachs man to me, Tori.

51:09.032 --> 51:11.444
Most of those blowhards
can't shut up about work.

51:12.969 --> 51:14.505
No, seriously, Matt. Tell me.

51:14.571 --> 51:16.414
Tell me the department,
let me do the math.

51:16.473 --> 51:17.781
I know a lot of people over there.

51:18.909 --> 51:21.185
- What department?
- Yeah, Matt.

51:21.244 --> 51:24.123
What do you... do?

51:27.617 --> 51:29.153
Excuse me.

51:29.219 --> 51:32.393
Do you guys know yen? I mean...

51:34.391 --> 51:36.393
Say yen gets, uh...

51:37.194 --> 51:41.472
transferred from...
Mr. Nariata's bank...

51:41.998 --> 51:45.639
in Tokyo, on a Monday,
and it lands in Rome.

51:46.870 --> 51:50.249
So what's .467 times 32?

51:50.307 --> 51:53.652
149.5... Lire. Right?

51:53.710 --> 51:56.623
Wham. Mr. Roma takes that, flips
it over to Mr. Queen Elizabeth.

51:56.680 --> 51:59.718
So what's 149.5 divided by 22.3?

51:59.783 --> 52:02.662
Six pounds British sterling
and 78 pence, right?

52:02.719 --> 52:06.223
Wham, he takes it, flips it over
to Mr. USA Today before opening bell,

52:06.289 --> 52:10.601
so what's 6.78 divided by 1.68?
It's 3.99 big, bad greenbacks,

52:10.660 --> 52:12.196
and guess who Mr. Yankee
Doodle Dandy wires it to

52:12.262 --> 52:14.208
over the international date line?
Mr. Nariata.

52:14.264 --> 52:17.734
How much is that yen worth now?
1.01 2, 1.2 percent more in one day.

52:17.801 --> 52:21.874
1.2 percent times 365 days?
I'll do the math, but...

52:21.938 --> 52:23.679
it's a lot of fucking blowfish.

52:24.875 --> 52:26.718
So that's what I do, Pete.

52:28.044 --> 52:30.354
Currencies, Franklin?

52:32.549 --> 52:35.223
- Yeah, Carlos.
- You two in the same division?

52:35.886 --> 52:39.129
Franklin? Matt?

52:41.591 --> 52:42.626
Um...

52:42.692 --> 52:45.673
I'm just fucking with you.
Yeah, Matt's a star, man.

52:45.729 --> 52:47.106
It's like having
Rain Man on the floor.

52:47.164 --> 52:48.837
Except you can touch him and shit.

52:49.833 --> 52:51.813
In fact, he just got promoted.

52:51.868 --> 52:54.781
That's right.
I didn't want to say anything.

52:54.838 --> 52:56.476
Guy above me got fired.

52:56.540 --> 52:59.350
Some girl asked him for a raise,
and he asked for a hand job.

52:59.409 --> 53:00.319
Oh.

53:00.377 --> 53:01.549
I guess he's the one
who got the raise, huh?

53:04.614 --> 53:05.957
Sounds like my kind of guy.

53:07.551 --> 53:08.996
She took him for about eight mil.

53:10.520 --> 53:11.521
Oh.

53:11.588 --> 53:14.967
Supreme Court takes sexual harassment
very, very seriously these days.

53:16.226 --> 53:17.432
It's about time, huh?

53:18.695 --> 53:21.733
Yes. Yes, it is about time.

53:21.798 --> 53:24.335
About time. About time.

53:24.401 --> 53:26.108
Well, great meeting you, Matt.

53:26.169 --> 53:28.843
I have to go make the rounds.

53:28.905 --> 53:30.350
You guys have fun.

53:32.475 --> 53:35.149
Holy shit, that was amazing.

53:59.903 --> 54:02.315
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

54:02.372 --> 54:05.182
Just be cool. Sexy redhead.

54:09.546 --> 54:10.923
Trish Anderson.

54:10.981 --> 54:14.656
Barry Nathan. Barry Nathan.

54:16.152 --> 54:17.460
Is it snowing?

54:19.522 --> 54:22.799
I think it's like... I think
it's like 65 degrees outside.

54:22.859 --> 54:24.736
No, I mean, are you holding?

54:25.662 --> 54:29.166
Oh, I...
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

54:29.232 --> 54:30.643
Do you want to have a little fun?

54:32.168 --> 54:33.579
Yes, I do.

54:33.637 --> 54:34.911
Come with me.

54:34.971 --> 54:37.281
Really? Oh, my God.

54:43.113 --> 54:45.457
Oh, my God!

54:45.515 --> 54:47.756
Oops, I did yours.

54:48.518 --> 54:50.259
It's like
a tractor beam in there.

54:50.320 --> 54:52.459
Jesus Christ, man! Hi.

54:52.522 --> 54:54.832
Actually, it's my friend, Frances.
It's OK, though, isn't it?

54:57.894 --> 54:59.965
OK, all right,
come on in here, man.

55:00.830 --> 55:02.537
You want any, Future Man?

55:03.600 --> 55:05.773
Come a little closer,
Barry Nathan.

55:13.710 --> 55:16.190
Beverly Hills.

55:28.425 --> 55:31.463
Hey, Frances... Do me a favor.

55:31.528 --> 55:34.134
Just take yours to go, OK, pal?

55:34.197 --> 55:36.404
Just go and
get the hell outta here.

55:36.466 --> 55:38.412
He doesn't want any of that.

55:38.468 --> 55:40.470
- He doesn't?
- Uh-uh.

55:40.537 --> 55:42.517
What the hell does Frances want?

55:42.572 --> 55:44.210
He wants to watch.

55:47.143 --> 55:48.554
I don't...

55:48.611 --> 55:51.524
He won't bother us.
Just let him watch.

55:51.581 --> 55:54.061
OK... Who is this Frances person?

55:54.117 --> 55:55.994
It's non-negotiable.

56:06.696 --> 56:08.334
I'm going to try this.

56:08.398 --> 56:09.399
Good.

56:13.536 --> 56:14.947
What do you think
this house cost them?

56:15.004 --> 56:18.679
Uh... Drug habit, kids in therapy.

56:18.742 --> 56:19.880
But hey, look at the view.

56:21.878 --> 56:23.721
But you like it, right?

56:25.215 --> 56:27.491
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

56:27.550 --> 56:30.656
Drexel's great.
It's a real opportunity for me.

56:30.720 --> 56:33.564
I'll get stock options, great benefits.

56:33.623 --> 56:36.069
You know, it's really a wonderful...

56:38.094 --> 56:39.266
What?

56:41.464 --> 56:43.068
I hate it.

56:45.068 --> 56:47.014
I hate my job.

56:48.438 --> 56:52.045
Wow, I... I've never
said that out loud before.

56:52.108 --> 56:53.985
But I do, I hate it. I...

56:54.878 --> 56:57.518
I do. I hate all of this.

56:57.580 --> 56:58.524
- Really?
- Hate it.

56:58.581 --> 57:00.754
- Gotcha.
- Crazy, right?

57:00.817 --> 57:04.390
But I just keep thinking,
"Do I really want to do this?

57:04.454 --> 57:06.263
Is this what I want
to do with my life?"

57:06.322 --> 57:07.392
Is it?

57:07.457 --> 57:08.663
I don't know. That's the thing.

57:08.725 --> 57:12.969
I am so confused and I really...
I really don't know.

57:13.863 --> 57:16.139
God, I'm sorry. This must
sound ridiculous to you.

57:16.199 --> 57:18.941
You are obviously
very smart at your job.

57:19.002 --> 57:22.950
No, no, no, Tori...
Whoa. Are you kidding me?

57:23.006 --> 57:25.043
I got this thing
that I know I'm good at,

57:25.108 --> 57:27.247
that everyone in my life...

57:28.077 --> 57:30.387
you know, expects me
to turn into a career.

57:31.848 --> 57:32.986
But I can't stand it.

57:33.650 --> 57:36.324
I know. I feel
the exact same way every day.

57:36.386 --> 57:37.956
Yeah, and then there's
no turning back, right?

57:38.021 --> 57:40.228
It's gonna be, like,
family and mortgage...

57:40.290 --> 57:42.270
- I know. Yes!
- And there's no way to quit.

57:42.325 --> 57:43.963
It's a trap.

57:49.566 --> 57:51.443
God, that sounds so messed up.

57:56.539 --> 57:57.916
Have you ever played the penis game?

57:57.974 --> 58:00.386
Uh...

58:00.443 --> 58:02.980
I am not prepared to reveal
that information, thank you.

58:03.046 --> 58:04.855
No, it's... it's a real game.

58:04.914 --> 58:07.895
I say the word penis, like really quiet,

58:07.951 --> 58:10.022
and then you say it
just a little bit louder,

58:10.086 --> 58:11.565
then I say it a little
bit louder than that,

58:11.621 --> 58:13.328
and the first to stop saying it loses.

58:13.389 --> 58:14.959
Are you ready? It's easy.

58:15.024 --> 58:16.401
Penis.

58:16.459 --> 58:19.099
- I don't know.
- Tori, trust me.

58:19.162 --> 58:21.768
There's nothing more fun than a job
you don't give a shit about losing.

58:24.133 --> 58:27.342
- Penis.
- Penis.

58:27.403 --> 58:28.609
Penis.

58:28.671 --> 58:30.275
- Penis.
- Penis!

58:30.340 --> 58:31.614
- Penis!
- Penis!

58:31.674 --> 58:34.280
- Penis!
- Penis!

58:38.348 --> 58:39.691
Let's call it a tie.

58:42.085 --> 58:44.656
Christ, Christ, you are
out of control, lady.

58:44.721 --> 58:45.859
Yeah, fuck you, too.

58:45.922 --> 58:47.333
What? I'm sorry.

58:47.390 --> 58:49.996
Don't apologize to me.
What are you, my child?

58:50.059 --> 58:51.333
Fuck you, then.

58:51.394 --> 58:54.136
- Yeah, that's better.
- Yeah. All right.

58:54.197 --> 58:57.406
I'm gonna swallow you whole, son.

58:58.101 --> 59:00.274
If you don't mind,
that would be fantastic.

59:01.571 --> 59:03.881
I mean, um...

59:03.940 --> 59:07.911
Suck my dick... bitch.

59:07.977 --> 59:09.388
Yeah!

59:09.445 --> 59:11.755
- That's it! That's good.
- OK.

59:18.721 --> 59:20.701
I'm gonna hammer you, Barry Nathan!

59:22.792 --> 59:24.533
Wait a minute...

59:24.594 --> 59:25.732
Yeah.

59:28.131 --> 59:29.906
All right, hold on, I wanna just...

59:31.568 --> 59:33.206
Hey! What the hell's he doing?

59:33.269 --> 59:34.407
Oh, he's getting a better angle.

59:34.470 --> 59:36.279
OK, he can't come near me.

59:36.339 --> 59:38.444
- How close?
- I don't want him touching me at all.

59:42.612 --> 59:44.614
- Let me outta here.
- What, you don't like this?

59:44.681 --> 59:45.682
Shit no!

59:46.316 --> 59:47.420
OW!

59:47.483 --> 59:49.360
- Yeah!
- You crazy bitch!

59:49.419 --> 59:51.421
Yeah, come on.
Lash out at me, Barry!

59:52.021 --> 59:54.365
Get the... I'll kill you!

59:54.424 --> 59:57.064
- I'll kill you!
- Fantastic!

59:57.126 --> 59:58.230
Jesus!

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:03.939
You people! Freakin' sick!

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.241
I didn't go to college, OK?

01:00:06.302 --> 01:00:09.476
You people crossed the line
here today! This is entrapment!

01:00:10.073 --> 01:00:11.074
No thank you!

01:00:15.078 --> 01:00:17.718
God, it's like, "Who lives
in this neighborhood," right?

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:18.884
Yeah, I know.

01:00:18.948 --> 01:00:20.552
Actually... hang on one sec.

01:00:24.554 --> 01:00:27.831
How do you feel about
a little bit of yard-hopping?

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:28.891
Uh... I don't...

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:30.699
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:00:36.032 --> 01:00:37.909
- Oh, my God!
- Shh...

01:00:40.269 --> 01:00:42.112
I don't think anyone's home.

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:43.973
Really?

01:00:44.874 --> 01:00:46.581
Welcome to your new house.

01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:48.589
How are you like this?

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:50.682
No one else I work with is
this much fun.

01:00:51.714 --> 01:00:53.591
I can't believe you're a banker.

01:00:54.217 --> 01:00:56.288
Yeah. Me neither.

01:01:00.423 --> 01:01:01.959
- Oh, shit.
- What?

01:01:02.025 --> 01:01:04.471
- Oh, yeah.
- Uh, no...

01:01:04.527 --> 01:01:07.371
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...
- No, not...

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:10.104
- Oh, we're doing this.
- I'm not getting on that thing.

01:01:10.166 --> 01:01:11.270
Oh, yeah!

01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:14.281
Smooth. That was really smooth!

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:15.975
- Come on!
- No, I'm not!

01:01:16.039 --> 01:01:17.450
- I know you want to.
- I will watch...

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:19.316
- Come on.
- ...safely from down here, thank you.

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:22.549
Tori, tonight we're not thinking,
we're doing.

01:01:25.948 --> 01:01:27.621
Come on. Whoa!

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:38.434
Yeah, this is
just coming back to me.

01:01:38.494 --> 01:01:40.804
Do you remember
when we played truth or dare

01:01:40.863 --> 01:01:42.467
at Lisa Mandriko's house?

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:46.571
I think that you and I got dared
into seven minutes in heaven?

01:01:46.636 --> 01:01:50.345
Hmm... No, doesn't ring a bell.

01:01:52.341 --> 01:01:56.016
But, you know, maybe
if we played again...

01:01:56.079 --> 01:01:57.353
You wanna play...

01:01:58.614 --> 01:02:00.355
- ...truth or dare?
- Truth or dare?

01:02:01.017 --> 01:02:02.690
OK. Wow.

01:02:02.752 --> 01:02:04.754
Uh... Yeah, truth.

01:02:04.821 --> 01:02:08.701
If I was your high school crush,
how come you never asked me out?

01:02:11.127 --> 01:02:14.734
Uh... You know, I just never had my in.

01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:16.105
Your "in"?

01:02:16.165 --> 01:02:19.408
Yeah, you know, the right moment.

01:02:19.469 --> 01:02:22.450
You know, the perfect
confluence of events, where...

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:28.817
No.

01:02:29.712 --> 01:02:33.353
No, I've been telling myself
that since high school.

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:35.157
And it's bullshit.

01:02:35.218 --> 01:02:37.755
I had plenty of opportunities
to ask you out.

01:02:39.689 --> 01:02:41.600
I was afraid.

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.462
Truth.

01:02:45.528 --> 01:02:48.031
If I had asked you out in high school,

01:02:48.097 --> 01:02:50.338
would you have said yes?

01:02:52.168 --> 01:02:55.547
Hm... That's not fair.

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:57.448
If I had known then,
what I Know now...

01:02:57.507 --> 01:03:00.784
Tori... come on.

01:03:05.148 --> 01:03:08.789
No. I probably
wouldn't have said yes.

01:03:13.389 --> 01:03:14.459
Why do you look so relieved?

01:03:14.524 --> 01:03:16.970
Because I am.

01:03:17.693 --> 01:03:22.642
My biggest regret is not having
the balls to ask you out in high school.

01:03:22.698 --> 01:03:24.609
And now I know that it
wouldn't have made a difference.

01:03:24.667 --> 01:03:27.910
Besides which, if I had, and you had
rejected me, I would have despised you,

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:29.472
and I wouldn't be sitting here
with you right now,

01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:32.884
having me...

01:03:32.942 --> 01:03:35.286
having the best night
of my entire life.

01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:44.529
Dare.

01:03:45.454 --> 01:03:47.434
Come over here,

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:50.903
and bring your lips
as close to mine as possible

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.803
without touching.

01:03:55.131 --> 01:03:56.906
Truth.

01:03:56.966 --> 01:03:59.879
Are you messing with me right now?

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:01.974
Dare.

01:04:02.038 --> 01:04:03.847
Come and find out.

01:04:14.917 --> 01:04:17.193
Come on...

01:04:18.354 --> 01:04:19.355
That good?

01:04:19.422 --> 01:04:21.629
No, not good. A little closer.

01:04:23.626 --> 01:04:25.162
That's it.

01:04:30.833 --> 01:04:32.369
What's that sound?

01:04:34.637 --> 01:04:37.743
I think that's my head, beating like...

01:04:38.674 --> 01:04:41.052
really fast.

01:04:42.845 --> 01:04:45.189
Dare me to make it go faster.

01:04:47.917 --> 01:04:49.692
I double dare you.

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:16.056
Oh... Hey, yeah, look...

01:05:16.112 --> 01:05:18.490
No, you know what?
No pressure, OK?

01:05:19.849 --> 01:05:21.419
Tonight, no thinking. Just doing.

01:05:42.538 --> 01:05:44.711
Now.

01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:56.257
What's going on, Wenders?

01:05:56.319 --> 01:05:59.562
Could we just sit down
for a second? I just want to talk.

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:04.430
Well, this is a big step.

01:06:04.493 --> 01:06:06.473
But I think it's the right thing.

01:06:06.529 --> 01:06:08.008
Hell yes.

01:06:08.064 --> 01:06:11.204
It doesn't exactly take
a rocket surgeon to figure that out.

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:16.245
Kyle, I have to tell you something.

01:06:17.006 --> 01:06:18.576
Please tell me you missed your period.

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:21.087
No, no...

01:06:22.044 --> 01:06:23.614
I applied to grad school.

01:06:23.679 --> 01:06:25.522
Oh.

01:06:25.581 --> 01:06:28.152
Wow, grad school.

01:06:28.217 --> 01:06:30.788
Wow. Where?

01:06:32.021 --> 01:06:34.467
- Cambridge?
- Is that in the Valley?

01:06:34.523 --> 01:06:36.161
England.

01:06:38.928 --> 01:06:41.101
You want to go to England?

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:43.268
Well, I mean, I don't... I don't know.

01:06:43.332 --> 01:06:46.006
I just thought we could talk about it.

01:06:46.068 --> 01:06:48.309
- I don't even...
- What about the condo?

01:06:48.371 --> 01:06:51.011
Well, we could always
rent it out if we had to.

01:06:51.073 --> 01:06:54.782
I don't know. I've got six franchises
opening in Encino alone next year.

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:56.118
I know.

01:06:56.178 --> 01:06:57.953
Honey, my dad is gonna
be fucking pissed.

01:06:58.014 --> 01:07:00.119
Oh, goddamn it.

01:07:00.182 --> 01:07:01.957
I thought this was
gonna be a special night.

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:03.588
- It is. No, it is.
- Guess I was wrong.

01:07:03.652 --> 01:07:06.963
No, you're kind of questioning
the whole thing. Aren't you?

01:07:07.023 --> 01:07:08.297
What, you just want to call
the whole thing off? Is that it?

01:07:08.357 --> 01:07:09.734
I don't even know if I got in yet, Kyle.

01:07:09.792 --> 01:07:12.170
Oh.

01:07:12.228 --> 01:07:16.142
I've been too scared to open it,
so why don't you do it for me?

01:07:16.198 --> 01:07:18.405
Sure. Sure, Wenders.

01:07:24.473 --> 01:07:26.248
"Dear Miss Franklin,"

01:07:26.308 --> 01:07:29.812
Thank you for your interest
in Cambridge University.

01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:32.689
"We regret to inf..."

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:36.591
Oh... sorry.

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:41.459
"We regret to inform you
that you have not been accepted

01:07:41.524 --> 01:07:44.061
into our graduate program."

01:07:44.994 --> 01:07:47.099
Goddamn it.

01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:52.171
Hey, wait, come on.

01:07:52.234 --> 01:07:55.841
No, don't let some fancy-pants school
in England ruin our night.

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:58.647
Honey, you can still
do your writing thing,

01:07:58.707 --> 01:08:01.415
and now you get to do it
right here next to me.

01:08:01.877 --> 01:08:04.289
OK?

01:08:04.346 --> 01:08:07.327
What can I do to make
you feel better? Huh?

01:08:08.818 --> 01:08:11.765
What about some bathroom sex?

01:08:11.821 --> 01:08:13.266
Will that do it?

01:08:17.126 --> 01:08:20.368
How many times
have you done that?

01:08:20.429 --> 01:08:22.807
Uh... You know, like three...

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.544
and a half times.

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:30.743
Oh, God.

01:08:30.805 --> 01:08:34.252
See, that is what I really
like about you, Matt.

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:36.790
You're honest.

01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:45.862
Tori, there's something
that I gotta tell you.

01:08:47.022 --> 01:08:49.263
You have a girlfriend, right?

01:08:49.325 --> 01:08:52.272
No, it's...

01:08:53.828 --> 01:08:56.002
it's kind of the opposite.

01:08:56.064 --> 01:08:58.341
- You have a boyfriend?
- No. No.

01:09:00.336 --> 01:09:04.613
Remember when I bumped into you
this morning at that video store?

01:09:06.341 --> 01:09:09.515
Actually, I don't work at Goldman Sachs.

01:09:09.578 --> 01:09:11.113
I work at that video store.

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:14.752
What?

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:18.162
Seriously,
I work at Suncoast Video.

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:20.063
Shut up!

01:09:21.991 --> 01:09:25.370
No, seriously,
I work at Suncoast Video.

01:09:32.201 --> 01:09:33.407
You lied to me?

01:09:33.469 --> 01:09:36.176
No. I mean,
I know it was stupid.

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:38.184
- But I only did it because I thought...
- Oh, my God.

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.015
If you knew that my life
was such a dead end...

01:09:40.075 --> 01:09:41.281
I wouldn't sleep with you.

01:09:41.343 --> 01:09:43.823
- No.
- Oh, my God.

01:09:43.879 --> 01:09:46.689
I am so stupid.

01:09:46.749 --> 01:09:49.854
I actually thought that maybe
you wanted to get to know me.

01:09:49.919 --> 01:09:51.761
- I do!
- You know what?

01:09:51.819 --> 01:09:55.393
Congratulations, Matt. You slept
with your high school crush.

01:09:55.457 --> 01:09:57.198
- Mission accomplished.
- No, Tori...

01:09:58.961 --> 01:10:00.634
Tori...

01:10:03.799 --> 01:10:06.803
Fuck.

01:10:10.172 --> 01:10:13.016
Hey. Where the hell
have you been, man?

01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:16.254
You will not believe what
the hell just happened...

01:10:16.312 --> 01:10:17.450
Barry, I gotta get out of here.

01:10:17.513 --> 01:10:19.618
Big ditto on that.
These people lost their way.

01:10:22.084 --> 01:10:23.085
Come on, come on, come on.

01:10:26.422 --> 01:10:29.096
Oh, shit, they're shooting at us.

01:10:30.893 --> 01:10:32.736
♪ I had sex
with a crazy bitch... ♪

01:10:32.795 --> 01:10:34.797
- Barry...
- ♪...and a German guy ♪♪

01:10:34.863 --> 01:10:36.604
- Barry.
- Yeah?

01:10:36.665 --> 01:10:38.611
I slept with Tori Frederking.

01:10:43.772 --> 01:10:45.046
Are you shitting me?

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:56.825
Los Angeles!

01:10:56.885 --> 01:11:01.994
Matt Franklin had sex
with Tori Frederking tonight!

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:14.071
Woo! What a night!

01:11:14.803 --> 01:11:16.749
And I told her I worked at Suncoast.

01:11:17.306 --> 01:11:19.308
And then you told her what?

01:11:20.809 --> 01:11:22.152
I told her I worked at Suncoast.

01:11:22.211 --> 01:11:23.918
Why are you like this?

01:11:23.979 --> 01:11:26.585
It wasn't fair, man.
I had to be honest with her.

01:11:26.649 --> 01:11:28.356
What, are you stupid?

01:11:29.818 --> 01:11:31.263
How do you fuck this up, man?

01:11:32.021 --> 01:11:35.434
Jesus, why can't you give
yourself one night of enjoyment?

01:11:35.491 --> 01:11:37.232
Just one night?

01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:39.569
Put a little relish on your hot dog!

01:11:39.628 --> 01:11:41.630
God...

01:11:43.232 --> 01:11:46.736
Here. I want you to do this.

01:11:46.802 --> 01:11:48.907
- No. No, Barry.
- This little bit right here.

01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:50.814
- Matthew...
- I don't do drugs.

01:11:50.873 --> 01:11:53.251
- You don't do anything!
- I just had sex with Tori Frederking!

01:11:53.309 --> 01:11:56.290
Yeah, well, I guess that's
not gonna work out for you now!

01:11:56.345 --> 01:11:58.689
Is it? You fucked it up.

01:11:59.214 --> 01:12:00.557
Sony, pal.

01:12:03.819 --> 01:12:05.025
All right, take the wheel.

01:12:05.087 --> 01:12:06.589
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:09.329
All right. All right.

01:12:09.391 --> 01:12:10.335
Yeah.

01:12:10.392 --> 01:12:12.201
- Here I go.
- You got it?

01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:15.775
- Barry?
- Yeah?

01:12:15.831 --> 01:12:17.333
Holy shit!

01:12:17.399 --> 01:12:20.039
Holy shit! Oh, shit!

01:12:23.539 --> 01:12:24.711
Fuck!

01:12:32.247 --> 01:12:33.726
We only lost a little bit.

01:12:59.241 --> 01:13:02.120
We start splashing around
and fooling around,

01:13:02.177 --> 01:13:04.623
and the next thing you know,
this flotation ring

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:06.091
hits me in the head.

01:13:06.148 --> 01:13:09.322
And I look up, and...

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:11.524
it's his grandma.

01:13:11.587 --> 01:13:14.124
Yeah. My crazy grandmother.

01:13:14.189 --> 01:13:15.668
And she says to me,

01:13:15.724 --> 01:13:19.035
"l can't tell if you're
fucking or drowning,

01:13:19.094 --> 01:13:21.734
but neither one is
letting me get any sleep!"

01:13:21.797 --> 01:13:22.867
Yeah...

01:13:24.666 --> 01:13:26.703
Could be worse.

01:13:26.769 --> 01:13:28.680
No, it couldn't, Barry.

01:13:28.737 --> 01:13:31.217
It couldn't be any worse.

01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:35.544
Put your hands in the air!

01:13:35.611 --> 01:13:39.889
I was wrong.
Now it couldn't be any worse.

01:13:41.950 --> 01:13:42.951
Matthew?

01:13:43.018 --> 01:13:45.294
Wow. Wrong again.

01:13:45.354 --> 01:13:47.197
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:13:47.256 --> 01:13:48.428
Cancel that backup request. Over.

01:13:48.490 --> 01:13:49.468
Ten-four.

01:13:49.525 --> 01:13:51.402
Are you two OK?

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:52.564
Yeah.

01:13:52.628 --> 01:13:53.902
Yeah, Dad.

01:13:53.962 --> 01:13:55.964
What's that all over your face, Barry?

01:13:56.031 --> 01:13:57.908
Cocaine.

01:13:59.902 --> 01:14:02.382
Dad, we're fine. Look, thank God
you were on duty tonight.

01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:05.851
Yeah. Why don't you get out of the car?

01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:09.983
Take it easy! All right!

01:14:10.045 --> 01:14:11.786
- Get down on the ground.
- What?

01:14:11.847 --> 01:14:13.485
Get down on the goddamn ground!

01:14:13.549 --> 01:14:15.290
Oh, my God! Oh, God!

01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:17.455
Oh, no! Oh, no!

01:14:17.519 --> 01:14:18.964
Why'd you steal a car?

01:14:19.021 --> 01:14:21.023
- Why'd you steal it?
- He had nothing to do with it!

01:14:21.089 --> 01:14:23.091
It was all me!
He was there, yeah,

01:14:23.158 --> 01:14:26.867
but then he chickened out at the end
and he ran back to the car!

01:14:26.929 --> 01:14:27.999
You did nothing?

01:14:28.063 --> 01:14:30.168
I drove a stolen car. That's it.

01:14:30.232 --> 01:14:32.439
I stole the car!

01:14:32.501 --> 01:14:34.640
And then the cocaine was in the car!

01:14:35.871 --> 01:14:36.975
You didn't buy the coke?

01:14:37.039 --> 01:14:39.781
No! No! No!

01:14:39.842 --> 01:14:42.083
- And you didn't have any?
- No, I swear to God, Dad.

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:43.851
I swear to God.

01:14:43.912 --> 01:14:48.361
Please, Mr. Franklin!
Don't send me to jail, please!

01:14:49.451 --> 01:14:51.226
Yeah, this car is in pretty rough shape.

01:14:51.286 --> 01:14:53.527
What's the sticker price on this, Barry?

01:14:53.589 --> 01:14:55.967
Fifty-three thousand.

01:14:56.024 --> 01:15:00.336
Fifty-eight thousand with the full
Corinthian leather package.

01:15:00.395 --> 01:15:02.272
Yeah, after you serve your jail time,

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:05.505
I figure you'll be on probation,

01:15:05.567 --> 01:15:09.174
working this off for at least
one to two years.

01:15:09.238 --> 01:15:11.479
Dad, the car's not that damaged.

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:13.042
Holy shit!

01:15:13.108 --> 01:15:15.213
Maybe three, four years.

01:15:15.277 --> 01:15:17.450
What are you...?
Jesus Christ, Dad!

01:15:18.046 --> 01:15:19.491
Maybe five.

01:15:19.548 --> 01:15:21.892
Depending on what
Kind of job that you get.

01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:23.827
Of course, with your education,

01:15:23.886 --> 01:15:25.832
you should be able to earn
a decent salary.

01:15:25.888 --> 01:15:27.492
I swear to God, I'll get
an engineering job, Dad!

01:15:27.556 --> 01:15:30.298
But you don't want
an engineering job, Matthew.

01:15:30.359 --> 01:15:31.702
I'll do whatever
you want me to do.

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.740
But what do you want?

01:15:33.795 --> 01:15:36.071
I don't know.

01:15:36.131 --> 01:15:38.577
Oh, no, Dad!
Oh, no, I'm sorry!

01:15:38.634 --> 01:15:41.877
I'm... I'm just messed up, OK?
I don't know what I want to do!

01:15:41.937 --> 01:15:44.850
And I'm sorry
I'm such a fucking failure!

01:15:47.709 --> 01:15:50.087
You haven't really failed, son,

01:15:50.145 --> 01:15:53.092
because you haven't
really tried to succeed.

01:15:53.148 --> 01:15:55.992
So don't credit yourself as a failure.

01:15:56.585 --> 01:15:58.565
You're worse than that.

01:16:03.992 --> 01:16:06.302
I just can't figure it out, Dad.

01:16:07.896 --> 01:16:10.604
Don't cry like that in jail, son.

01:16:13.302 --> 01:16:15.839
I don't wanna go...

01:16:18.607 --> 01:16:20.086
You boys will spend at least,

01:16:20.142 --> 01:16:24.591
at least, seven days in LA County Jail
before they arraign you.

01:16:26.114 --> 01:16:27.923
You'll be there with child molesters.

01:16:27.983 --> 01:16:29.155
Please, don't.

01:16:29.217 --> 01:16:30.423
But don't worry.

01:16:30.485 --> 01:16:33.398
We'll make sure the guards know
you're a cop's kid.

01:16:37.826 --> 01:16:41.035
Bill, I can't keep this up!
Look at Matt's face!

01:16:41.096 --> 01:16:43.975
He's about to lay
a big goose egg in the car!

01:16:46.034 --> 01:16:49.982
OK, boys, this is your one
and only mulligan.

01:16:50.038 --> 01:16:51.244
What?

01:16:51.306 --> 01:16:52.580
You're free to go.

01:16:52.641 --> 01:16:54.814
Oh, my God, thank you!

01:16:54.876 --> 01:16:56.822
Thank you! Thank you!

01:16:56.878 --> 01:16:59.051
So you guys don't have
to turn us in?

01:16:59.114 --> 01:17:00.388
Shut the fuck up.

01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:01.655
Relax, Matt.

01:17:01.717 --> 01:17:03.253
We're the LAPD.

01:17:03.318 --> 01:17:04.888
But don't do it again, Barry.

01:17:04.953 --> 01:17:06.523
I mean it. No more coke.

01:17:06.588 --> 01:17:08.659
Oh, are you kidding me?

01:17:08.724 --> 01:17:12.001
I promise. Never. Never. Are you crazy?

01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:13.767
This was like the craziest night.

01:17:13.829 --> 01:17:15.706
Wipe that coke off your face.

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:20.172
I... can't.

01:17:20.235 --> 01:17:23.409
Could someone... Mr. Johnson?

01:17:29.578 --> 01:17:32.388
Thank you, Mr. Franklin.

01:17:33.682 --> 01:17:37.255
Matt, take a shot at something.

01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:40.493
Don't think about it too much.
Just take the shot.

01:17:40.555 --> 01:17:42.762
I don't even know where to aim.

01:17:42.824 --> 01:17:47.000
Anywhere. Everywhere.
Just take wild shots.

01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:50.642
Hell, it's something
just to hear the gun go off.

01:17:54.636 --> 01:17:56.047
Thanks, Dad.

01:18:05.013 --> 01:18:07.220
That's really scary.

01:18:08.583 --> 01:18:10.756
My brain feels like snot.

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:14.557
I think she might have
left her car back at Kyle's.

01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:20.165
Matt, come on!

01:18:24.599 --> 01:18:26.840
Ball! Ball! Ball! Ball!

01:18:29.638 --> 01:18:31.242
Anybody who thinks Broder

01:18:31.306 --> 01:18:33.411
will actually ride The Ball,
place your bets with Bryce.

01:18:33.475 --> 01:18:35.250
Anybody who thinks that
he won't go through with it,

01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:38.052
'cause he's a total pussy,
place your bets with Benji.

01:18:38.113 --> 01:18:40.821
And it's going to be... choice!

01:18:42.117 --> 01:18:43.960
Yeah!

01:18:54.429 --> 01:18:57.899
Ball! Ball! Ball! Ball!

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.011
Woo!

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:02.048
We're gonna run the world.

01:19:02.104 --> 01:19:04.277
How do you know
that she's still here?

01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:06.842
Asshole!

01:19:07.876 --> 01:19:09.048
She's here.

01:19:09.111 --> 01:19:11.455
Broder's gonna ride The Ball!

01:19:20.522 --> 01:19:21.592
Do I get a helmet?

01:19:21.656 --> 01:19:23.829
Yeah, it's down there.
Right by the tampons.

01:19:23.892 --> 01:19:25.030
Fucking slam it!

01:19:25.093 --> 01:19:26.697
Yeah!

01:19:26.762 --> 01:19:28.935
Oh, fuck. I have a feeling I'm fucked.

01:19:28.997 --> 01:19:30.772
Hey.

01:19:30.832 --> 01:19:32.402
Hey.

01:19:35.737 --> 01:19:38.650
Stop. Matt, please...

01:19:38.707 --> 01:19:40.209
Don't be mad.

01:19:40.275 --> 01:19:43.688
Wow, Shelly. This really hurts.

01:19:48.116 --> 01:19:50.596
You got to get...

01:19:50.652 --> 01:19:53.428
No! I'm not riding, man!
I'm not riding!

01:19:53.488 --> 01:19:55.661
I got fired today.

01:19:55.724 --> 01:19:57.635
So fucking sit in it!

01:20:03.398 --> 01:20:05.344
I think I'm gonna ride The Ball.

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:06.538
Tori!

01:20:06.601 --> 01:20:08.342
I'm not interested
in any more of your bullshit!

01:20:08.403 --> 01:20:09.848
Look, listen, listen.

01:20:09.905 --> 01:20:12.715
I only lied about one detail
about myself, and that's my job.

01:20:12.774 --> 01:20:15.584
Everything else was real.
Tonight was real.

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:17.521
And it was... it was amazing!

01:20:18.446 --> 01:20:20.949
You never would have talked to me
for more than two minutes, admit it,

01:20:21.016 --> 01:20:23.587
if you knew that I worked
at Suncoast Video.

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:26.861
You lied to me all night
so I would have sex with you.

01:20:26.922 --> 01:20:30.233
So you only had sex with me
because you thought I was a banker?

01:20:30.292 --> 01:20:32.033
No, I went to a party with you

01:20:32.093 --> 01:20:33.629
because I thought
you were a banker.

01:20:33.695 --> 01:20:38.166
But I had sex with you because
I thought that you were small...

01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:42.709
and funny... and honest.

01:20:43.905 --> 01:20:46.545
I thought you were different
from everybody else.

01:20:46.608 --> 01:20:48.110
But you're not.

01:20:48.176 --> 01:20:52.056
You're just like all these
other scared little boys.

01:20:52.714 --> 01:20:55.024
All right, hey!
Who's it gonna be, huh?

01:20:55.083 --> 01:20:56.994
Who's stepping up
to the plate tonight?

01:20:57.052 --> 01:20:58.554
Who wants a shot at the title?

01:20:58.620 --> 01:20:59.963
Come on!

01:21:00.021 --> 01:21:01.830
- Who wants a chance...?
- I'll do it!

01:21:01.890 --> 01:21:04.234
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a contestant!

01:21:04.292 --> 01:21:07.466
The Mattinator! Franklin!

01:21:09.097 --> 01:21:10.337
What are you doing?

01:21:10.398 --> 01:21:12.036
I don't know.

01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:13.977
Franklin! Franklin! Franklin!

01:21:14.035 --> 01:21:15.810
Clear the way. Clear the way.

01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:17.282
Franklin! Franklin! Franklin!

01:21:17.339 --> 01:21:19.046
No, Matt! Matt, please
don't do this, OK?

01:21:19.107 --> 01:21:20.814
You don't have to prove
anything to these people!

01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:22.947
Whoever thinks that Matt's
not gonna do it,

01:21:23.011 --> 01:21:24.422
place your bets with Benji.

01:21:24.479 --> 01:21:27.085
- And any... body else?
- Don't. Matt, Matt...

01:21:27.148 --> 01:21:29.059
Listen to me!
You don't want to do this, man!

01:21:29.117 --> 01:21:31.961
Let me do it for you, OK?
You have a great life ahead of you!

01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:34.864
I got nothing! Matt, don't do this!

01:21:34.923 --> 01:21:36.960
Goddamn it!

01:21:37.025 --> 01:21:39.938
Ladies and gentlemen, a round
of applause for Mr. Goldman Sachs!

01:21:42.130 --> 01:21:44.167
Kyle...

01:21:44.232 --> 01:21:46.610
Shut the fuck up and drive.

01:21:46.668 --> 01:21:47.703
Deal.

01:21:47.769 --> 01:21:49.180
Matt, don't do this.

01:21:49.237 --> 01:21:50.477
Why are you doing this?

01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:55.153
Please don't do this, Matt!
Oh, my God.

01:21:57.946 --> 01:22:00.620
I'm Matt Franklin!

01:22:00.682 --> 01:22:03.424
I work at Suncoast Video at the mall...

01:22:04.319 --> 01:22:06.265
and I still live with my parents!

01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:09.391
You suck!

01:22:11.126 --> 01:22:12.935
I don't know what I'm doing up here.

01:22:12.994 --> 01:22:15.338
I'm scared! And you know what?

01:22:16.331 --> 01:22:21.576
I have been so afraid of my life
that I have missed my life!

01:22:21.636 --> 01:22:24.480
But I'm like all of you!
We're all scared!

01:22:24.539 --> 01:22:27.486
I mean, come on, admit it!

01:22:28.209 --> 01:22:30.621
We're all trying to be
something that we're not!

01:22:31.446 --> 01:22:34.154
But tonight, all of that changes.

01:22:34.215 --> 01:22:36.058
Tonight, I'm not afraid.

01:22:36.117 --> 01:22:40.361
Tonight, I got one thing
to say to all that bullshit!

01:22:43.558 --> 01:22:44.935
Fuck it.

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:01.947
Kyle, Kyle, I'm begging you.
Please don't let him do this!

01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:04.752
No, honey,
it's actually really safe.

01:23:04.813 --> 01:23:07.089
Relax. See, it's gonna
roll down this hill, right?

01:23:07.148 --> 01:23:09.492
You see the bend?
It actually goes uphill, right?

01:23:09.551 --> 01:23:11.030
You know how gravity works, right?

01:23:11.086 --> 01:23:12.724
He's just gonna stop.
It's gonna be gentle.

01:23:12.787 --> 01:23:14.596
And... it's gonna be choice.

01:23:14.656 --> 01:23:16.761
Look, look! I'm telling you.

01:23:16.825 --> 01:23:19.135
That's my brother and I love him,
and I don't want you to do this!

01:23:19.194 --> 01:23:22.937
Oh, did I say it was gonna be choice?
I did. So cool out!

01:23:28.737 --> 01:23:31.308
Yeah, let's make some noise
for Matt Franklin!

01:23:31.373 --> 01:23:34.616
Yeah, baby! Yeah!

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:36.280
Yeah!

01:23:41.783 --> 01:23:43.387
On three!

01:23:44.319 --> 01:23:45.320
Three!

01:23:56.131 --> 01:23:57.667
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

01:23:57.732 --> 01:24:00.679
- Yeah!
- Shit!

01:24:00.735 --> 01:24:04.649
- Breathe deeply! Keep breathing!
- Yeah!

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:11.690
Oh, shit!

01:24:11.746 --> 01:24:13.987
Christ! Oh! Oh, shit!

01:24:14.049 --> 01:24:15.221
Matt!

01:24:23.158 --> 01:24:24.603
Oh, my God!

01:24:24.659 --> 01:24:28.106
Oh, shit! Holy Christ! Holy Christ!

01:24:35.937 --> 01:24:38.508
Oh, shit!

01:24:44.746 --> 01:24:46.225
Fuck!

01:24:46.281 --> 01:24:47.783
Oh, my God!

01:24:47.849 --> 01:24:51.262
Fuck me! Fuck me! Aah!

01:25:13.875 --> 01:25:17.982
Oh... Shit! Help!

01:25:18.046 --> 01:25:19.389
Fuck!

01:25:35.897 --> 01:25:37.069
Give me your truck!

01:25:37.132 --> 01:25:38.770
Honey, The Ball was
not supposed to do that.

01:25:38.833 --> 01:25:40.471
Give me your fucking keys!

01:25:40.535 --> 01:25:41.673
- Relax, OK?
- Now!

01:25:41.736 --> 01:25:42.806
Don't fucking touch me!

01:25:42.871 --> 01:25:45.647
- I did not know that the road was...
- Hey, hey, hey. I'll drive.

01:26:26.247 --> 01:26:27.590
Matt!

01:26:27.649 --> 01:26:28.684
Matt!

01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:30.058
No, no, no...

01:26:37.425 --> 01:26:39.029
- Are you OK?
- Are you OK?

01:26:39.661 --> 01:26:40.901
Holy shit!

01:26:41.863 --> 01:26:43.501
What's up!

01:26:43.565 --> 01:26:46.239
- I rode the fucking Ball!
- You rode The Ball!

01:26:46.301 --> 01:26:47.109
Woo-hoo!

01:26:47.769 --> 01:26:49.112
You'll see, we'll get back there,

01:26:49.170 --> 01:26:51.878
all the girls will be
sitting with their legs open,

01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:53.544
clapping with their thighs.

01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:57.217
Oh, hello. Thank God.

01:26:58.580 --> 01:26:59.923
Matt!

01:26:59.981 --> 01:27:01.961
Take him.

01:27:03.251 --> 01:27:07.222
Matt! Don't ever do that again!
Do you hear me?

01:27:07.288 --> 01:27:08.892
It's not a problem.

01:27:20.401 --> 01:27:21.880
Could I have your phone number?

01:27:24.339 --> 01:27:26.512
I just want to take you out to dinner.

01:27:26.574 --> 01:27:27.951
Or, like, a movie.

01:27:29.777 --> 01:27:31.484
Just hang out with you.

01:27:31.546 --> 01:27:34.288
Matt, you were
a loser in high school.

01:27:34.349 --> 01:27:37.728
Now you're just a loser
who rode The Ball...

01:27:38.519 --> 01:27:39.759
and fucked me.

01:27:43.658 --> 01:27:45.365
Are you happy?

01:27:45.994 --> 01:27:47.200
No.

01:27:48.796 --> 01:27:50.241
I'm so sorry I lied to you.

01:27:51.633 --> 01:27:53.271
I'm so sorry, Tori.

01:27:54.402 --> 01:27:56.245
I'm gonna leave you alone now.

01:27:58.039 --> 01:27:59.416
I promise.

01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:05.253
Matt!

01:28:06.681 --> 01:28:09.958
818-404-7327.

01:28:15.823 --> 01:28:17.825
And that was pretty impressive.

01:28:28.102 --> 01:28:33.313
It's Matt! Hey, Matt! Hey, Matt! Hey!

01:28:33.374 --> 01:28:35.911
My buddy, Matt Franklin!

01:28:40.581 --> 01:28:41.992
Yeah!

01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:43.427
So it all worked out!

01:28:43.484 --> 01:28:45.760
You were happy when you read
that letter tonight.

01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:47.822
- No, I was not happy.
- Yes. Yes you were!

01:28:47.889 --> 01:28:50.995
- I'm telling you I wasn't happy.
- I saw it. I just want you to admit it!

01:28:52.126 --> 01:28:53.605
What? Admit what?

01:28:53.661 --> 01:28:55.800
That I don't want my baby
to leave the nest?

01:28:55.863 --> 01:28:57.308
Is that why you're mad at me?

01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:01.073
I'm canceling the movers, Kyle.

01:29:01.135 --> 01:29:02.842
What? No. What does that mean?

01:29:02.904 --> 01:29:04.815
You know what it means.

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:08.018
Honey, you said yes tonight.

01:29:08.076 --> 01:29:09.282
Yeah, I know.

01:29:09.344 --> 01:29:10.982
Oh, shit, Wenders...

01:29:12.046 --> 01:29:14.583
Don't do this to me.

01:29:14.649 --> 01:29:16.219
I'm begging you, don't... don't do it.

01:29:16.284 --> 01:29:18.890
I'm begging you, please
don't do this to me.

01:29:20.788 --> 01:29:21.823
I'm doing it.

01:29:21.889 --> 01:29:24.062
Oh...!

01:29:35.903 --> 01:29:39.350
You just...
through my head.

01:29:48.850 --> 01:29:50.227
You know what?
I don't know what the hell

01:29:50.284 --> 01:29:52.355
I'm gonna do with myself now.

01:29:54.222 --> 01:29:55.758
Hell, I don't know
what the hell I'll do with myself

01:29:55.823 --> 01:29:58.497
while I'm thinking about
what the hell to do with myself.

01:30:01.396 --> 01:30:03.137
I hear that's what college is for.

01:30:05.666 --> 01:30:07.646
There's a lot of this.

01:30:07.702 --> 01:30:09.113
No, not right now.

01:30:10.571 --> 01:30:12.517
And there's also a lot of this.

01:30:24.018 --> 01:30:26.123
You're beginning
to make a lot of sense.

01:30:36.130 --> 01:30:39.805
We should probably say goodbye
before I screw this up again.

01:30:40.868 --> 01:30:42.108
OK.

01:30:42.170 --> 01:30:43.308
OK.

01:30:55.983 --> 01:30:57.257
That was bold.

01:30:57.318 --> 01:30:59.855
That was the scariest thing
I did all night.

01:31:59.113 --> 01:32:00.717
- Who wants breakfast?
- Ooh...

01:32:00.781 --> 01:32:02.385
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:32:02.783 --> 01:32:03.784
