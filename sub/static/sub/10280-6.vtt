WEBVTT

00:06.674 --> 00:07.775
Previously on E.R.:

00:07.808 --> 00:09.110
I'm not working
with him.

00:09.143 --> 00:10.244
Why?

00:10.278 --> 00:11.079
Because he treats nurses
like idiots.

00:11.112 --> 00:11.679
Whatever.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.181
That's it.

00:13.214 --> 00:14.482
I'm filing a grievance
against him.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.550
You are such a jerk.

00:16.584 --> 00:17.718
Why?

00:17.751 --> 00:19.220
You slept with her?

00:19.253 --> 00:20.354
I'll wait for you.

00:20.388 --> 00:22.056
Okay, I'll
be right back.

00:22.090 --> 00:24.125
Frank, take care
of my baby brother.

00:24.158 --> 00:26.327
Is he potty-trained?

00:26.360 --> 00:27.728
What the hell
are you doing?

00:27.761 --> 00:29.330
Being a little hard on him,
don't you think?

00:29.363 --> 00:31.065
What are you talking about?

00:31.099 --> 00:32.500
Nathan. He's doing
a pretty good job, considering.

00:32.533 --> 00:33.501
Considering what?

00:33.534 --> 00:34.468
He has Parkinson's.

00:34.502 --> 00:35.803
Excuse me.

00:41.175 --> 00:43.144
How much did you take out?

00:43.177 --> 00:45.079
CORDAY:
None of it.

00:45.113 --> 00:46.647
None of it?

00:46.680 --> 00:50.084
Metastatic lesions are studding
the entire abdominal cavity--

00:50.118 --> 00:53.154
present on the outer surface
of the liver, the spleen

00:53.187 --> 00:54.755
the small intestines,
the colon.

00:54.788 --> 00:57.091
Shouldn't you take out
what you can?

00:57.125 --> 00:59.293
Surgical removal won't
affect survival.

00:59.327 --> 01:01.362
You'll need
to see an oncologist.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.197
Survival?

01:03.231 --> 01:05.132
You don't think
I'll survive it?

01:05.166 --> 01:06.600
You'll need
to see an oncologist.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.169
No.

01:08.202 --> 01:09.537
Tell me.

01:09.570 --> 01:12.140
Do I have a chance,
or don't I?

01:12.140 --> 01:14.208
There's always a chance,
Mr. Willow.

01:14.242 --> 01:16.544
How much of
a chance?

01:16.577 --> 01:18.512
Given the extent
of your disease

01:18.546 --> 01:19.780
with chemotherapy

01:19.813 --> 01:22.450
less than a ten percent,
five-year survival.

01:22.483 --> 01:25.153
What's the earliest?

01:25.186 --> 01:28.456
The least amount
of time?

01:28.489 --> 01:30.858
I'll have the oncologist
see you.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.596
ROMANO:
Excessive therapy?

01:35.629 --> 01:36.830
Excessive?
How's this for excessive?

01:36.864 --> 01:38.366
I had my arm sliced off.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.268
I mean, what do I have
to do to get full therapy?

01:40.301 --> 01:42.770
I have to have a pack of wolves
come chew my leg off, too?

01:42.803 --> 01:45.273
Look, my physical therapist,
my orthopedic surgeon

01:45.306 --> 01:46.440
and the Chief of Staff
of the hospital

01:46.474 --> 01:48.176
that pays your premiums...

01:48.209 --> 01:49.610
What's his name again?
That's right-- me!

01:49.643 --> 01:50.511
His insurance company.

01:50.544 --> 01:51.779
...have all determined

01:51.812 --> 01:53.247
I need a minimum
of five days a week

01:53.281 --> 01:54.815
in order to regain
occupational use.

01:54.848 --> 01:56.584
I need a solid tumor consult
for Mr. Willow.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.186
It's not disability,
you gnat!

01:58.186 --> 01:59.220
I'm-I'm still
working. It's...

01:59.253 --> 02:01.855
Hello? Hello?

02:03.324 --> 02:05.426
Coward.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.727
The peek and shriek
still out of it?

02:06.760 --> 02:08.262
No. I told him.
You told him?

02:08.295 --> 02:10.231
You were in there for
all of 90 seconds.

02:10.264 --> 02:11.832
Start a Dilaudid drip
at two milligrams q 30 minutes.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.201
You know, I am
going to have

02:13.234 --> 02:15.203
to get you your
own complaint box.

02:15.203 --> 02:17.205
There's nothing I
can do for the man
but pain control.

02:17.238 --> 02:19.273
No, no, your medical student,
the martini shaker.

02:19.307 --> 02:20.641
He camped out in my office
and says

02:20.674 --> 02:21.842
you refused to put him on call.

02:21.875 --> 02:23.244
He has Parkinson's
disease.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.612
Yeah. Hence the martini shaker
reference.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.447
Come on, Lizzie, work with me.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.749
Stress and sleep deprivation
only exacerbate his symptoms.

02:28.782 --> 02:29.650
He says he's managing it.

02:29.683 --> 02:30.951
Makes a good argument.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.453
I don't think
it's fair to the others

02:32.486 --> 02:33.921
to have to make them
pick up his slack.

02:33.954 --> 02:36.224
I'm not going to put the man
on 36 hours straight.

02:36.257 --> 02:38.492
He'll take a nap.
It's bad enough
he has to treat patients.

02:38.526 --> 02:40.228
Oh, I get it.
What?

02:40.261 --> 02:42.596
You have something against
doctors with disabilities.

02:42.630 --> 02:43.897
Only on a case by case basis.

02:43.931 --> 02:45.599
Look, if this guys
wants the full ream

02:45.633 --> 02:47.735
surgical rotation
experience,
give it to him.

02:47.768 --> 02:50.304
The last thing I
need is some dim
lawyer from the ACLU

02:50.338 --> 02:51.739
coming in here
and telling me

02:51.772 --> 02:53.807
I have to put
handrails on
the urinals.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.676
And, oh, by the way,
the guy with the twitch--

02:55.709 --> 02:56.910
he's suing your ass.

02:56.944 --> 02:58.379
And we care nothing
about Mr. Nathan?

02:58.412 --> 02:59.447
Who's Nathan?

02:59.480 --> 03:01.649
Him. My Parkinson's student.

03:01.682 --> 03:02.883
Oh. Uh, right.

03:02.916 --> 03:06.254
Uh, no. I don't care.
This place is littered
with masochists.

03:06.254 --> 03:07.788
Just make sure
he doesn't kill anyone.

03:07.821 --> 03:09.690
MAN:
I found her asleep
on the El train.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.325
LOCKHART:
Her name's Sara Paspalis.

03:11.359 --> 03:12.760
She's 14.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.595
Hey, Sara,
how you doing?

03:14.628 --> 03:15.963
Sara, can you hear me?

03:15.996 --> 03:17.531
Just let me sleep.

03:17.565 --> 03:18.999
LOCKHART:
Did she fall?

03:19.032 --> 03:21.269
She was in her seat
when we found her.

03:21.269 --> 03:22.536
I don't see any signs
of trauma.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.405
Abby, do you see any signs
of trauma?

03:24.438 --> 03:27.275
You could suggest a head CT
and LP just to be safe.

03:27.275 --> 03:28.509
Why are you so sleepy, Sara?

03:28.542 --> 03:29.910
I'm tired.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.645
Are you taking any medicine?

03:31.679 --> 03:33.013
What about drugs?

03:33.046 --> 03:35.483
Let's get a tox screen and APAP,
CBC and lytes.

03:35.516 --> 03:36.717
Uh, foley

03:36.750 --> 03:38.419
UA with dip and icon, too.

03:38.452 --> 03:39.787
Multiple GSW coming in.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.455
Weaver's stuck
in a waste management meeting.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.391
She wants to push
your 12:30 meeting to 1:00.

03:43.424 --> 03:44.692
Sure. Uh, wait. What meeting?

03:44.725 --> 03:45.859
Uh, the one with HR.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.595
You know, the nurses' petition.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.530
What petition?

03:50.464 --> 03:51.432
Hey.

03:51.465 --> 03:52.300
Hey.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.534
Hi.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.535
Hi.
What are you
doing here?

03:54.568 --> 03:55.969
I came here to see you.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.838
I mean, I wasn't planning
on coming here, you know

03:57.871 --> 03:59.973
here to see you, but I'm glad
you're working today.

04:00.007 --> 04:02.310
I was going to call first,
but Jody got sick

04:02.310 --> 04:03.311
so I figured
I'd just bring her in.

04:03.344 --> 04:04.545
Who's Jody?

04:04.578 --> 04:05.646
My girlfriend.
Your girlfriend?

04:05.679 --> 04:06.714
Yeah, what do you think?

04:06.747 --> 04:07.981
You approve?
She's cute.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.817
Yeah? It's only been a couple
of weeks.

04:09.850 --> 04:10.851
Come on.
Come on and meet her.

04:10.884 --> 04:11.885
I want...
You'll like her.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.321
Okay, just
one second.

04:13.321 --> 04:14.522
Um, she's not
feeling well?

04:14.555 --> 04:16.055
Yeah. I don't know.
Maybe the flu.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.426
She has a bad headache,
and her stomach was upset.

04:18.459 --> 04:19.692
We had some shrimp in Biloxi.

04:19.726 --> 04:20.761
Uh, smelled kind of funny.

04:20.793 --> 04:22.062
You had shrimp
in Biloxi?

04:22.095 --> 04:23.997
Yeah, I rented a Cessna
for a couple of days.

04:24.031 --> 04:25.666
Hey, Jody this is
my big sister, Abby.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.034
Hi.
Hi.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.602
Kind of little
to be your big sister.

04:28.636 --> 04:29.903
( laughs )

04:29.937 --> 04:31.038
Eric says you're
not feeling well.

04:31.071 --> 04:32.340
What seems to
be the, uh...

04:32.373 --> 04:34.742
( retches )

04:34.775 --> 04:35.943
...problem?

04:37.000 --> 04:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:28.662 --> 05:30.398
That's right,
mama-san. I'm
bulletproof.

05:30.431 --> 05:31.965
Tachy at 110,
B.P. holding at 100/80.

05:31.999 --> 05:32.800
He's going to need blood.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.034
Get four units O-neg.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.436
I don't need blood.
I need a beer.

05:35.469 --> 05:36.904
Yeah. Happy hour isn't
until 4:00.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.606
How about a nurse
to sit on my face?

05:38.639 --> 05:40.140
Are you up for a
lap dance, Malik?

05:40.173 --> 05:41.509
Maybe.

05:41.542 --> 05:42.976
Stay away from me,
you chocolate homo.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.512
How did you know
my stage name?

05:44.545 --> 05:46.414
Abby, we're going
to need some extra hands.

05:46.447 --> 05:47.515
Okay. I'll be
right there.

05:47.548 --> 05:48.882
So, what do you think?
The shrimp?

05:48.916 --> 05:49.983
Well, that's a
good theory.

05:50.017 --> 05:53.421
How did you
guys meet?

05:53.454 --> 05:54.422
She's really great.

05:54.455 --> 05:55.423
She's smart, funny...

05:55.456 --> 05:56.424
when she's not throwing up.

05:56.424 --> 05:57.658
Does she go
to school

05:57.691 --> 05:59.427
or is the bookstore
like a full-time thing?

05:59.460 --> 06:00.828
She's 21... almost.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.430
Twenty.

06:02.430 --> 06:03.631
Yeah, she's trying
to become a writer.

06:03.664 --> 06:04.898
I mean, she
is a writer.

06:04.932 --> 06:05.866
She just hasn't been
discovered yet.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.501
I've read her stuff.

06:07.535 --> 06:08.936
I mean, it's good.
It's really good.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.438
You guys are...
I think it's good.

06:10.471 --> 06:11.872
You're flying
around the country?

06:11.905 --> 06:13.507
Part of the Midwest,
and the South.

06:13.541 --> 06:14.575
Her parents are
from Ohio.

06:14.608 --> 06:15.643
And you can
afford a plane?

06:15.676 --> 06:16.677
Rent, rent.
Renting the plane.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.512
What's wrong?
Nothing?

06:18.546 --> 06:20.514
It just seems
like a lot of
money, that's all.

06:20.548 --> 06:22.483
We'll get out of your hair
if this is a bad time again.

06:22.516 --> 06:24.151
Abby, we need your help.
No, it's not.

06:24.184 --> 06:25.453
Okay. Um, it's
not a bad time.

06:25.453 --> 06:26.920
I'll be back in a minute.

06:26.954 --> 06:27.821
( alarm sounds )

06:27.855 --> 06:28.822
Muffled heart sound.

06:28.856 --> 06:29.890
I want the American doctor.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.459
Chen is the
American doctor.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.561
Betadine, seven-and-
a-half sterile gloves

06:33.594 --> 06:35.663
and a 30 French chest tube
on a vascular clamp.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.030
70 systolic.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.466
Hey, Abby,
have you seen Sara?
Who?

06:38.499 --> 06:39.767
The girl that the
cops brought in.

06:39.800 --> 06:40.834
She fell asleep
on the El.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.002
She was in
Exam One.

06:42.035 --> 06:43.136
I was there,
remember?

06:43.170 --> 06:44.505
She's gone.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.206
CORDAY:
Ten blade,
sterile drapes.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.608
Pericardial effusions.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.009
Spinal needle and syringe.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.210
Oh, me love you long time.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.680
Right in the ass.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.114
She's the one
with the big needle.

06:54.147 --> 06:55.048
Hey, dude?

06:55.082 --> 06:56.717
Can you hear me?

06:56.750 --> 06:58.552
He's out,
but he's breathing.
Good.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.087
I think she may have
wandered off. Abby?

07:00.120 --> 07:01.622
We're in the
middle of a
trauma, Harkins.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.090
What would you
like us to do?

07:03.123 --> 07:04.725
Stop and help
you look for
your patient?

07:04.758 --> 07:06.494
I'm in.
No pressure
and no pulse.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.498
Needle out.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.165
40cc's of pericardial blood.

07:12.199 --> 07:13.501
No blood in the thoraseal.

07:13.501 --> 07:14.968
Hold it.
Sinus rhythm.

07:15.002 --> 07:16.970
Pressure's
coming up.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.138
Nice needle.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.039
LOCKHART:
Third unit's going up.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.574
Dr. Corday?

07:20.608 --> 07:22.543
Pressure's 110/72,
sats are at 95%.

07:22.576 --> 07:24.044
Dr. Corday, we have a trauma
patient in here

07:24.077 --> 07:25.613
in respiratory
distress.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.014
CHEN:
Maybe we should
crack his chest anyway.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.782
CARTER:
Getting no breath
sounds at all.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.718
26-year-old female went down
in a crosswalk at Felton.

07:30.751 --> 07:31.852
GCS 13, slightly altered.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.621
HALEH:
Pulse ox 89,
tachy at 120.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.656
She carries her
own oxygen, but
the tank's empty.

07:35.689 --> 07:36.890
We've been going
easy on the O2

07:36.924 --> 07:38.058
in case she's a
chronic retainer.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.226
I don't hear anything.

07:39.259 --> 07:40.828
Do you think
she has bilateral pneumos?

07:40.861 --> 07:42.095
That doesn't
make any sense.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.096
There's no real
signs of trauma.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.765
What about the scars?

07:44.798 --> 07:46.834
Looks like she's had lung volume
reduction surgery

07:46.867 --> 07:47.935
and a liver transplant.

07:47.968 --> 07:48.969
All right, everybody

07:49.002 --> 07:50.070
quiet, just quiet.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.744
There.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.546
Coarse rhonchi bilaterally.

08:00.213 --> 08:02.850
That's so faint.

08:02.883 --> 08:05.152
ABG looks good.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.620
I understand
you had a conversation

08:06.654 --> 08:07.655
with Dr. Romano.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.222
Yeah, he was very supportive.

08:09.256 --> 08:11.859
Unfortunately, he's not the one
assessing your performance

08:11.892 --> 08:13.661
so in the future,
if you have any concerns

08:13.694 --> 08:14.695
regarding your rotation...

08:14.728 --> 08:16.564
I've told you my concerns.

08:16.597 --> 08:19.800
I'd appreciate it if you go
through the proper channels.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.001
Well, I'll certainly try.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.235
Alison, do you have emphysema?

08:22.269 --> 08:25.573
Alpha-one... antitryp...

08:25.606 --> 08:27.040
Alpha-one antitrypsin
deficiency?

08:27.074 --> 08:28.208
What can you tell us

08:28.241 --> 08:30.043
about Alpha-one
antitrypsin deficiency

08:30.077 --> 08:31.244
Mr. Nathan?

08:31.278 --> 08:32.279
It's a genetic disease.

08:32.312 --> 08:33.780
It causes reduced serum levels

08:33.813 --> 08:34.914
in Alpha-one blood proteins.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.583
Why is that bad?

08:36.616 --> 08:38.785
The abnormal mutation gets
hung up in the liver.

08:38.818 --> 08:39.820
Causes cirrhosis.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.254
And why can't she breathe?

08:41.288 --> 08:44.725
Well, without Alpha-one,
trypsin is unopposed.

08:44.758 --> 08:45.993
It's eating up

08:46.026 --> 08:47.695
the alveolar surfaces
in her lungs.

08:47.728 --> 08:49.262
Yes, and... ?

08:53.366 --> 08:55.636
Pan-acinar emphysema.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.738
She's got the lungs
of an 80-year-old chain smoker.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.106
She's...

09:00.273 --> 09:02.209
She's drowning in her own mucus.

09:02.242 --> 09:04.111
Alison, you're not getting
enough oxygen.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.614
We need to put a tube
down your throat.
No tube, no tube.

09:06.614 --> 09:07.715
No, we need to.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.683
How about a bipap?
Pressure mask?

09:09.717 --> 09:11.351
Will that work?

09:11.384 --> 09:13.721
It might.

09:13.754 --> 09:14.888
Get one.
Call RT.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.256
Good call.

09:17.691 --> 09:18.892
LOCKHART:
Third unit's up.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.761
MALIK:
Pressure's 100/72,
sats 96.

09:20.794 --> 09:21.695
Haleh, do you
know anything

09:21.729 --> 09:22.863
about some
petition?

09:22.896 --> 09:23.731
Yeah. I signed
it. We all did.

09:23.764 --> 09:24.998
Not me.

09:25.032 --> 09:26.634
I can't believe
a guy comes in here

09:26.634 --> 09:28.301
with three bullet holes,
and nobody pages me.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.837
You are such a trauma queen.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.639
What is it,
about cafeteria
hours again?

09:31.672 --> 09:33.340
No. Dr. Kovac.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.643
They figure you weren't going
to do anything, 'cause, well...

09:35.676 --> 09:36.777
you know.
No.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.245
Do anything
about what?

09:38.278 --> 09:39.246
MALIK:
Don't sweat it.
They just whining.

09:39.279 --> 09:40.848
You cut up Denise.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.650
PRATT:
Looks like she
saved your butt.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.184
We had to put in
a chest tube.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.385
That was my wife,
you gook bitch.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.154
Hey.
I'm coming back for you.

09:47.187 --> 09:48.956
Me and my boys are going
to cut you up.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.692
Only boys you're going to be
seeing are in the prison shower.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.895
You okay?

09:54.928 --> 09:56.029
Chen?

09:56.063 --> 09:58.666
I'm fine.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.033
Repeat ABG in 20 minutes

10:00.067 --> 10:01.969
and get a portable chest
before we move her.

10:02.002 --> 10:03.904
Dr. Corday, penetrating trauma
in Curtain Three.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.305
Be right there.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.107
I'd like to follow
through the evaluation

10:07.140 --> 10:08.175
for heart-lung transplant.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.910
Complete discharge summaries

10:09.943 --> 10:12.846
and review all ER charts
for possible surgical consults.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.381
Can I go to the ball after that?

10:14.414 --> 10:16.049
There's an M&M at 3:00.
Don't be late.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.351
She's a good teacher.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.688
Yeah, that's what they keep
telling me.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.057
How are you feeling?

10:24.091 --> 10:25.192
Yeah, a little better.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.394
Sorry I almost
puked on you.

10:27.427 --> 10:29.362
Oh, it's okay.
It comes with the territory.

10:29.396 --> 10:30.363
Where's Eric?

10:30.397 --> 10:31.098
He went out
for a smoke.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.299
A smoke?

10:32.332 --> 10:33.801
I know. I-I keep
telling him to quit

10:33.834 --> 10:34.868
but he doesn't
listen to me.

10:34.902 --> 10:36.169
You should
talk to him.

10:36.203 --> 10:37.938
Maybe he'll listen
to his sister.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.439
Especially since
you're a nurse...

10:39.472 --> 10:40.841
Can you excuse me one second?

10:40.874 --> 10:41.809
Yeah.

10:41.842 --> 10:42.910
( clears throat )

10:42.943 --> 10:43.844
Hey.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.278
I'm, uh, being sent

10:45.312 --> 10:47.047
to the principal's
office because of you.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.415
What?
I don't know.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.050
You pissed off a bunch
of nurses this time.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.218
How?

10:51.251 --> 10:52.720
I think it's an
attitude problem.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.454
I have a good
attitude.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.857
Hey, Abby...
I do.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.425
Abby, I still can't find her.

10:58.458 --> 11:01.228
Jerry, could you help Harkins
find her patient?

11:01.261 --> 11:05.065
Uh, big hospital,
many patients, very busy.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.266
Abby...

11:06.299 --> 11:09.870
Call security.

11:09.903 --> 11:12.105
OLBES:
Darius here skateboarded
into a car door.

11:12.139 --> 11:13.306
No LOC, normal vitals

11:13.340 --> 11:15.743
obvious ankle deformity,
but good pulses.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.410
Old geezer opened it
right in front of me.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.012
Do you have a last name,
Darius?

11:19.046 --> 11:19.813
It's just Darius.

11:19.847 --> 11:20.981
Oh, like Cher.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.082
Do you have any allergies,
Darius?

11:22.115 --> 11:23.083
No.
Have you seen my brother?

11:23.116 --> 11:24.151
Oh, you just
missed him.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.285
He wanted to
buy cigarettes.

11:25.318 --> 11:26.486
I sent him to
the newsstand.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.788
He's getting me
lottery tickets.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.056
( laughs ):
What?

11:29.089 --> 11:30.090
He offered,
I figured what the hell.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.291
It's 87 million.

11:31.324 --> 11:32.860
You realize
you have a better chance

11:32.893 --> 11:34.161
of getting hit by a car.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.763
Is that supposed
to be funny?
Sorry.

11:35.763 --> 11:37.397
You want to go in with me?
No, thanks.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.900
Maybe you could use it
to cover my malpractice lawsuit.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.068
Hey.

11:41.101 --> 11:41.969
Hey.

11:42.002 --> 11:42.870
Uh-oh.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.371
National Enquirer.

11:44.404 --> 11:47.440
Embarrassing, I know,
but Jody's a gossip junkie.

11:47.474 --> 11:48.942
When did you start smoking?

11:48.976 --> 11:49.977
Oh, a while ago.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.445
What's a while?

11:52.479 --> 11:53.914
What difference does it make?

11:53.947 --> 11:55.215
I don't know.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.851
Nobody starts smoking
over the age of 25.

11:57.885 --> 11:59.219
Oh, what can I say?

11:59.252 --> 12:00.788
I'm a late bloomer.

12:02.455 --> 12:04.291
You know,
I'm serious.

12:04.324 --> 12:05.492
Eric, it's really not good.

12:05.525 --> 12:07.360
Well, you smoke

12:07.394 --> 12:09.362
and you've been
smoking since you
were what, eight?

12:09.396 --> 12:10.530
Oh, that's cute.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.965
We're not talking about me.

12:11.999 --> 12:14.067
You're right.
How's Jody?

12:14.101 --> 12:15.268
( sighs )

12:15.302 --> 12:17.404
I don't know,
she seems better.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.239
She's not pregnant.

12:19.272 --> 12:20.974
Was that a
possibility?

12:21.008 --> 12:23.410
I don't know.
You tell me.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.512
Well, yeah, I guess.

12:25.545 --> 12:26.880
I don't know.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.281
Oh, come on.
What if... ?

12:28.315 --> 12:29.449
Okay, what if she was?

12:29.482 --> 12:31.284
Then what?
But she's not.

12:31.318 --> 12:32.419
But you just said she could be.

12:32.452 --> 12:33.386
But she's not.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.822
What are you doing, Eric?

12:34.822 --> 12:35.823
What's going on?

12:35.856 --> 12:36.523
Okay, Mom, I'm having sex

12:36.556 --> 12:37.825
with my girlfriend.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.492
I mean, what
are you, a nun?

12:39.526 --> 12:42.229
You show up here with this girl
who's barely out of her teens

12:42.262 --> 12:43.396
who may be, could be pregnant?

12:43.430 --> 12:44.431
But isn't.

12:44.464 --> 12:45.833
On some weird impromptu leave.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.467
People take vacations.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.103
You were renting a plane
that I know you can't afford.

12:50.137 --> 12:52.472
Oh, I forgot,
you're a financial wizard.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.942
Uh, don't. Don't mock me.

12:56.343 --> 12:58.345
I'm not the one who's...

12:58.378 --> 13:00.180
Who's what? In love?

13:00.213 --> 13:02.983
Oh, you're in love?

13:03.016 --> 13:04.117
I don't know. Maybe.

13:04.151 --> 13:05.318
Okay.

13:05.352 --> 13:06.353
Is that such
a bad thing?
No.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.055
MAN:
Help!

13:08.088 --> 13:09.456
Somebody, help!

13:09.489 --> 13:11.324
Over here, help!

13:11.358 --> 13:14.427
Can you go inside
and tell them I need a gurney?

13:14.461 --> 13:16.563
Fast.

13:20.233 --> 13:23.136
Sara?

13:23.170 --> 13:25.272
Sara?

13:25.305 --> 13:26.539
How long has she
been like this?

13:26.573 --> 13:28.075
About two trains.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.342
Is she dead?

13:29.376 --> 13:31.879
Wake up, Sara.

13:31.912 --> 13:34.547
She might wake up
if I kissed her.

13:37.117 --> 13:39.086
Sats any better?

13:39.119 --> 13:40.520
93 after a couple of nebs.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.422
She wants to take the mask off.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.357
Okay. Just keep an eye
on her rate.

13:44.391 --> 13:45.458
Okay.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.060
( wheezing )

13:47.094 --> 13:49.196
Did you call my dad?

13:49.229 --> 13:51.231
We left a message.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.566
Do you take prolastin
for your Alpha-one?

13:53.600 --> 13:55.535
No.

13:55.568 --> 13:58.105
I got hives

13:58.138 --> 13:59.172
then anaphylactic shock.

13:59.206 --> 14:00.073
( wheezes )

14:00.107 --> 14:01.909
Throat closed up.

14:01.909 --> 14:05.245
A true anaphylactic reaction
to prolastin is pretty rare.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.614
Lucky me.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.284
They took me off
a few years ago.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.120
( wheezes )

14:13.153 --> 14:15.188
You have pneumonia.

14:15.222 --> 14:17.257
Fifth time
this year.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.325
A new record.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.592
Well, we can clear that up.

14:19.626 --> 14:22.395
Do you have an allergies
to any antibiotics?

14:22.429 --> 14:24.331
No.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.398
( wheezes )

14:25.432 --> 14:27.467
I want to sign a D.N.R.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.439
My liver's sick.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.074
My lungs are shredded.

14:34.107 --> 14:37.177
NATHAN:
Well, the antibiotics

14:37.210 --> 14:38.178
will make you feel better.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.413
( wheezing )

14:40.447 --> 14:42.449
Don't take it personally.

14:42.482 --> 14:45.118
I just don't want any more help.

14:45.152 --> 14:48.388
I'm ready to die.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.958
( wheezing )

14:54.527 --> 14:55.695
Can you hold
her arm down?

14:55.728 --> 14:57.064
No one mentioned
she was seizing.

14:57.097 --> 14:59.099
KOVAC:
She is not.

15:01.969 --> 15:03.636
Six centimeter
jagged scalp lac.

15:03.670 --> 15:06.573
Looks like it's torn
straight through
to the bone.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.041
What was she in for?

15:08.075 --> 15:09.242
Uh, we don't
know for sure.

15:09.276 --> 15:10.343
Police found
her asleep

15:10.377 --> 15:11.478
and hard to
rouse on the El.

15:11.511 --> 15:12.579
LOCKHART:
Possible drug overdose.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.047
Possible brain bleed.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.548
I just don't understand
these girls

15:15.582 --> 15:17.417
who'll take any pill
handed to them at a party.

15:17.450 --> 15:18.986
Dr. Corday?
Yep?

15:18.986 --> 15:20.320
Can you, uh,
witness a D.N.R.?

15:20.353 --> 15:22.222
I need a second
physician's signature.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.490
CORDAY:
Oh, there's no gag.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.092
She's not protecting
her airway.

15:25.125 --> 15:25.658
I got it.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.460
Thanks, Luka.

15:27.494 --> 15:30.430
Okay. Let's intubate her
and then get her up to C.T.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.132
You care to do
the honors?

15:32.165 --> 15:34.467
Uh, yeah, sure.

15:34.501 --> 15:36.069
Scope in the left hand.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.137
Sats are 98.

15:37.170 --> 15:38.238
CORDAY:
Slide along the tongue.

15:38.271 --> 15:43.010
Across and out
of the way.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.244
Good.

15:44.277 --> 15:49.149
That's excellent.
Now look for the cords.

15:49.182 --> 15:52.319
That's it.
Excellent.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.189
Lucky lottery ticket.

15:56.223 --> 15:58.058
Since you're a friend,
it's only two bucks a pop.

15:58.091 --> 15:59.459
They're one buck
across the street.

15:59.492 --> 16:02.629
Not with my patented
number selection system.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.237
She looks like
she's feeling better.

16:10.270 --> 16:13.206
She should
after 125 milligrams of Demerol.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.407
Well, she had a migraine.

16:14.441 --> 16:16.143
So she needed
Demerol?

16:16.176 --> 16:19.046
She failed Compazine,
she's allergic to Imitrex

16:19.079 --> 16:20.313
and she's almost 21.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.215
LOCKHART:
Oh, he mentioned that,
did he?

16:22.249 --> 16:23.216
( chuckling ):
He's a funny guy.

16:23.250 --> 16:24.717
Thinks he's in love.

16:24.751 --> 16:27.220
Well, you can't have
enough love in the world.

16:27.254 --> 16:28.388
What, you don't like her?

16:28.421 --> 16:29.489
I don't know.
I just met her.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.258
So did he.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.660
Jerry, call me when the labs
for Fay Graham gets here.

16:33.693 --> 16:34.661
You bet.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.096
Speaking of betting

16:36.129 --> 16:37.564
you feeling lucky
today, Dr. Chen?

16:37.597 --> 16:40.067
Oh, reselling lottery tickets
is a felony.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.368
Got an officer
needs some work here.

16:41.401 --> 16:42.669
What happened?

16:42.702 --> 16:44.337
She was involved
in a shooting earlier.

16:44.371 --> 16:46.273
Her hand got shredded
by a driver's side window.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.175
She keeps saying
it's no big deal, but...

16:48.208 --> 16:50.143
It's not.
Here, let's sit down
right over here.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.078
I think she's lost
a pint by now.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.279
I'm okay, Hal.

16:52.312 --> 16:53.146
Okay, let me take
a look at it.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.381
JERRY:
Abby?

16:54.414 --> 16:56.316
Director of Nursing's
calling for you.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.351
You're late for some
meeting with Romano.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.787
Okay. Here, someone
will be with you
in a minute, okay?

17:00.820 --> 17:02.189
Nathan, you're
surgical, right?

17:02.222 --> 17:03.423
Uh, yeah,
but I'm taking...

17:03.456 --> 17:05.125
Somebody from trauma
or hand should

17:05.157 --> 17:06.826
take a look
at this possible
flexor tendon lac.

17:06.858 --> 17:08.395
Irrigate while
you're waiting

17:08.428 --> 17:09.596
but she might need an O.R.

17:09.628 --> 17:11.231
She collapsed on the street.

17:11.263 --> 17:14.401
She's got pneumonia
and signs of liver rejection.

17:14.434 --> 17:15.568
Why isn't she on a vent?

17:15.602 --> 17:16.803
She declined
the use of one.

17:16.836 --> 17:18.305
You just said she
had pneumonia again

17:18.338 --> 17:19.606
and her lungs are
shot to begin with.

17:19.638 --> 17:21.374
How the hell is she
supposed to breathe?

17:21.407 --> 17:22.474
Mr. Deluca,
your daughter signed

17:22.509 --> 17:23.542
a Do Not Resuscitate order.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.377
She's just depressed.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.180
She gets that way sometimes.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.715
L-Let me talk to her.

17:28.748 --> 17:32.185
I don't think that she wants
to be talked out of it.

17:32.219 --> 17:33.853
Well, of course she does.
She's just a kid.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.188
She's 26.

17:35.222 --> 17:36.756
She gets tired.

17:36.789 --> 17:39.259
Yeah, she's dying.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.694
We're all dying.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.863
Not like that.

17:43.896 --> 17:47.200
She's in tremendous pain,
and she knows

17:47.234 --> 17:48.601
that that's
never going to change.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.570
She stopped taking
her antirejection meds

17:50.603 --> 17:51.771
weeks ago.

17:51.804 --> 17:54.274
Catch her up.

17:54.307 --> 17:55.375
Can't do that.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.709
Then I'll make her take 'em.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.445
It won't work.

17:58.478 --> 18:01.414
She's still going to be allergic
to the only medicine

18:01.448 --> 18:02.549
that can keep her alive.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.351
We'll find new meds!

18:04.384 --> 18:06.253
And when those fail

18:06.286 --> 18:08.588
she's going to need
a complete heart/lung transplant

18:08.621 --> 18:10.290
for even a chance of survival.

18:10.323 --> 18:13.326
Then I'll get her one.

18:13.360 --> 18:17.330
So she can face the same disease
all over again?

18:20.267 --> 18:24.337
If you don't want
to fight for her

18:24.371 --> 18:27.307
I'll find a doctor who will.

18:34.414 --> 18:37.284
Insert and cock your wrist
at 90 degrees.

18:37.317 --> 18:40.187
Fired three rounds
before I knew it.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.455
Department issue
semiautomatic.

18:45.425 --> 18:48.628
If possible,
use your pinkie
to steady your hand.

18:48.661 --> 18:51.198
It was all really fast,
you know?

18:51.198 --> 18:53.366
I'm sure you did
the right thing.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.335
It's my first week.

18:55.368 --> 18:57.204
I've been scared
every day.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.639
If it's not what
you were expecting

18:59.672 --> 19:04.544
there's no shame in
exploring other options.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.746
Dr. Corday, I need you.

19:06.779 --> 19:10.583
I'll be back to
check the sutures.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.652
Could you put some pressure
right here?

19:12.685 --> 19:13.820
Yes, sir.

19:13.853 --> 19:16.689
I'll be right back.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.625
But she was so altered
when she came inside...
Excuse me.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.293
Don't you think that officer

19:20.327 --> 19:21.894
could possibly be suffering
from post-traumatic stress?

19:21.928 --> 19:23.330
Yes. Call a social worker.

19:23.363 --> 19:24.731
You know,
I just thought it was me

19:24.764 --> 19:25.898
but you're kind of cool,
aren't you?

19:25.932 --> 19:28.635
Pardon?

19:28.668 --> 19:30.237
A social worker?

19:30.237 --> 19:32.272
Isn't it our job
to take care of these people?

19:32.305 --> 19:34.907
If you insist on being on
a surgical rotation, Mr. Nathan

19:34.941 --> 19:36.343
then act like a surgeon.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.378
Act like I don't
give a damn. Got it.

19:38.411 --> 19:41.248
That woman's hand
is still bleeding
and in need of suture.

19:41.248 --> 19:42.515
That's how you
can help her.

19:42.549 --> 19:43.616
Now what was it?

19:43.650 --> 19:45.285
She was so altered
when she came in

19:45.318 --> 19:47.254
so I figured it was something
that wouldn't show up

19:47.254 --> 19:48.421
on a tox screen--

19:48.455 --> 19:49.722
a rave drug
like ecstasy maybe.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.258
And then I remembered
I read this article

19:51.291 --> 19:52.359
about special K...

19:52.392 --> 19:53.593
Come on, Harkins,
get on with it.

19:53.626 --> 19:54.761
Well, it's
replaced roofies.

19:54.794 --> 19:55.962
It's mostly
a date rape drug.

19:55.995 --> 19:57.964
It's sometimes recreational.

19:57.997 --> 20:01.534
I just never thought
to look before, Dr. Corday.

20:01.568 --> 20:02.869
Of course you
disagree, Kerry.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.504
It flies in the face
of the culture

20:04.537 --> 20:05.672
you've established.

20:05.705 --> 20:06.873
What?
There is no culture.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.341
We're too busy saving lives.

20:08.375 --> 20:09.509
It's not funny, Kerry.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.910
By not occluding
it at the onset

20:10.943 --> 20:12.612
you have allowed it
to proliferate.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.781
You. You have anything
monosyllabic you care to add

20:14.814 --> 20:16.716
other than apologies
for being late?

20:16.749 --> 20:17.884
Sorry.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.686
That's two syllables.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.755
So, Mary... answer me this.

20:22.789 --> 20:24.291
What are you looking for
from us?

20:24.324 --> 20:25.758
As Nursing Director

20:25.792 --> 20:27.427
I feel a full
investigation
is in order.

20:27.460 --> 20:28.728
Of Dr. Kovac?

20:28.761 --> 20:30.663
Of the entire
physicians' staff.

20:30.697 --> 20:31.831
Oh, come on--

20:31.864 --> 20:33.733
but it's true

20:33.766 --> 20:35.735
we get no respect,
but this is one complaint

20:35.768 --> 20:37.504
filed by one nurse
against one doctor

20:37.537 --> 20:39.005
that she... knew.

20:39.038 --> 20:40.807
That she what?

20:40.840 --> 20:43.843
Nothing. She just
doesn't like him anymore.

20:43.876 --> 20:45.478
CAIN:
I have a petition

20:45.512 --> 20:46.979
signed by every nurse
in the department.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.681
Right, all of whom
are tired.

20:48.715 --> 20:50.717
They're overworked,
underpaid and pissed off.

20:50.750 --> 20:51.551
Excluding the males.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.052
And Nurse Lockhart.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.754
Apparently, your
relationship
with Dr. Kovac

20:54.787 --> 20:55.988
ended better
than Chuny's.

20:57.824 --> 21:00.793
Did you really
just say that?

21:00.827 --> 21:03.496
So it's true. You're all suckers
for the accent.

21:03.530 --> 21:05.398
Robert.
The bottom line is

21:05.432 --> 21:07.400
this will all be handled
by the medical exec committee

21:07.434 --> 21:08.868
in three weeks.

21:08.901 --> 21:12.071
So until then, how do we untwist
everybody's panties?

21:12.104 --> 21:15.041
NATHAN:
Open your eyes,
I know you're faking.

21:15.074 --> 21:16.843
Flowers from a doc.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.911
( strained breathing )

21:18.945 --> 21:20.880
I like this hospital.

21:20.913 --> 21:23.883
Ah, they were half price
at the gift shop. Day old.

21:23.916 --> 21:26.886
Pull off a few petals,
they're good as new.

21:26.919 --> 21:28.855
Thanks.

21:28.888 --> 21:30.357
Did he go outside?

21:30.390 --> 21:32.725
Yeah, yeah, he's
taking a walk.

21:32.759 --> 21:33.826
In circles?

21:33.860 --> 21:34.994
Yeah.

21:35.027 --> 21:36.996
He did that a lot
when Mom died.

21:37.029 --> 21:38.765
( labored breathing )

21:38.798 --> 21:41.568
Sometimes it's harder on
the people that love us.

21:41.601 --> 21:42.669
He's in denial.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.937
Thinks there's actually hope.

21:44.971 --> 21:48.708
And so do I.

21:51.444 --> 21:53.480
Excuse me?
Excuse me.

21:53.513 --> 21:54.847
Malik, did Weaver
get down here yet?

21:54.881 --> 21:57.384
I haven't seen her.
Hey, how'd it go?

21:57.417 --> 21:59.852
Luka.

21:59.886 --> 22:02.389
Hey, where'd you go?
I was looking all over for you.

22:02.389 --> 22:03.490
I'm sorry,
I had a meeting.

22:03.523 --> 22:04.657
Hey, she's resting now.

22:04.691 --> 22:05.925
Can I talk to you
in just one...?

22:05.958 --> 22:07.059
She's feeling
a lot better

22:07.093 --> 22:09.095
and John was really great
with her.

22:09.128 --> 22:10.463
( Lockhart sighs )

22:10.497 --> 22:11.531
Who?

22:11.564 --> 22:12.999
Uh, your boyfriend,
John Carter?

22:13.032 --> 22:14.100
Carter?
Carter.

22:14.133 --> 22:15.134
Hey, listen

22:15.167 --> 22:16.469
can I borrow your keys?

22:16.503 --> 22:18.938
I think we need to crash
for a while.

22:18.971 --> 22:20.807
I was hoping that
we could stay at your place.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.442
Oh, yeah, sure, no problem.

22:22.475 --> 22:23.410
We'll grab a hotel
if it's a hassle.

22:23.443 --> 22:24.811
I just figured

22:24.844 --> 22:26.946
we could have some fun,
spend some time together...

22:26.979 --> 22:28.047
No, you're right,
it would be fun.

22:28.080 --> 22:28.981
You sure?

22:29.015 --> 22:29.882
I mean,
there's not

22:29.916 --> 22:31.050
a lot of room, but...

22:31.083 --> 22:32.719
Doesn't matter--
Jody's great

22:32.752 --> 22:34.887
and you should get to know her
while we're in town.

22:34.921 --> 22:37.056
Okay, Eric, it's fine.

22:37.089 --> 22:38.090
Good.
Great.

22:38.124 --> 22:40.427
So...

22:40.427 --> 22:41.694
So...?

22:41.728 --> 22:42.629
The keys.

22:42.662 --> 22:43.963
The keys.
Right.

22:43.996 --> 22:45.498
I'm sorry.
They're in my locker.

22:45.532 --> 22:46.899
Hold on.

22:46.933 --> 22:48.835
Elizabeth, can you handle
the rape exam in Four?

22:48.868 --> 22:50.069
I believe you did
her consult.

22:50.102 --> 22:51.771
She's an E.R. case.

22:51.804 --> 22:54.674
Yeah, well, at the moment,
I'm down an E.R. attending.

22:56.008 --> 22:57.910
Sorry. I tried
to get to you first.

22:57.944 --> 22:59.679
What'd she say?

22:59.712 --> 23:02.014
Suspended, pending
an investigation.

23:02.048 --> 23:04.751
I guess the nurses
don't like me.

23:04.784 --> 23:07.119
Look, I'm sorry, but once they
got the director involved...

23:07.153 --> 23:08.855
It's fine.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.990
Right now, I'm not too
crazy about them either.

23:11.023 --> 23:12.792
It could be as little
as three days.

23:12.825 --> 23:14.461
You could use
the free time, right?

23:14.461 --> 23:16.095
Thanks for the heads-up.

23:22.869 --> 23:25.805
Pull inferiorly
on the speculum heel slowly.

23:25.838 --> 23:27.840
I should've
checked sooner.

23:27.874 --> 23:30.142
She was alone on the train,
out of it.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.812
CORDAY:
Open and visualize
the cervix.

23:32.845 --> 23:34.581
( Harkins sighs )

23:34.614 --> 23:35.515
Whoop, not so fast.

23:35.548 --> 23:37.049
I'm... sorry.

23:37.083 --> 23:40.186
You sure this is the case
you should be learning on?

23:40.219 --> 23:42.855
The patient's unconscious.
You have stricter criteria?

23:42.889 --> 23:45.191
Father's here.
Should I let him in?

23:45.224 --> 23:46.593
No.

23:46.626 --> 23:51.531
Could you shut
the door, please?

23:51.564 --> 23:53.199
Let's swab for a wet mount
and a Gram stain.

23:53.232 --> 23:54.867
Is this the cervix?

23:54.901 --> 23:56.703
I think it's the cervix.

23:56.736 --> 23:58.971
A small tear
at the introitus.

23:59.005 --> 24:00.540
What does that mean?

24:00.573 --> 24:02.174
Semen present.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.877
Check the culture for GC
and chlamydia.

24:04.911 --> 24:05.978
You'll need consent

24:06.012 --> 24:07.814
for a full kit.

24:11.518 --> 24:13.520
What, are
they dating now?

24:13.553 --> 24:15.054
CARTER:
I don't think he's
going to make

24:15.087 --> 24:16.656
the best surgeon.

24:16.689 --> 24:19.692
But he seems to have a way
with the patients.

24:19.726 --> 24:21.928
Maybe he could be
a nursing liaison.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.129
Need him for something?

24:23.162 --> 24:24.163
No, not at the moment.

24:24.196 --> 24:25.632
Dr. Corday.

24:25.665 --> 24:27.567
Where is she?
Where is my daughter?

24:27.600 --> 24:30.136
Mr. Paspalis. Uh, we're
examining her right now.

24:30.169 --> 24:32.905
Why do they make
those shower knobs so sharp?

24:32.939 --> 24:34.707
Hey, Pratt, head lac,
no L.O.C.

24:34.741 --> 24:35.875
Sorry, cat, I'm off.

24:35.908 --> 24:36.776
Good night, Lisa.

24:45.618 --> 24:47.887
So, did you get
your lottery tickets yet?

24:47.920 --> 24:49.889
And live on the dole
my whole life?

24:49.922 --> 24:51.090
( chuckles )

24:51.123 --> 24:52.892
I thought you
were off at 5:00.

24:52.925 --> 24:55.862
Charts. I can't sleep knowing
that they're sitting here

24:55.895 --> 24:57.196
waiting for me.

24:57.229 --> 24:59.098
How come nobody told us
that being a doctor

24:59.131 --> 25:00.600
was all about killing trees?

25:00.633 --> 25:01.601
Mm.

25:01.634 --> 25:02.835
You need some help?

25:02.869 --> 25:04.203
I think I have it down.

25:04.236 --> 25:05.838
How about a beer, maybe?

25:05.872 --> 25:07.674
WOMAN:
No! I don't take trains!

25:07.707 --> 25:08.307
I hate trains!
Stop it!

25:08.340 --> 25:09.909
I want to get off...!

25:09.942 --> 25:12.011
Haleh, Ativan's not working
on Dorothy.

25:12.044 --> 25:13.580
Give her five of Haldol.

25:13.580 --> 25:14.847
My pleasure.

25:14.881 --> 25:16.282
Let me off!
Clicktey-clack...

25:16.315 --> 25:17.917
That guy really spooked you
today.

25:17.950 --> 25:19.952
Who?

25:19.986 --> 25:22.922
You should go home.

25:22.955 --> 25:25.257
We treat crazy people here.

25:25.291 --> 25:26.959
It's nothing new.

25:26.993 --> 25:29.128
Come on, get your things,
let's go.

25:29.161 --> 25:30.763
We'll split a cab.

25:33.633 --> 25:35.134
Trauma coming in?

25:35.167 --> 25:38.938
Car jumped a curb, and ran
straight into a line of people

25:38.971 --> 25:40.907
waiting to buy lottery tickets.

25:40.940 --> 25:43.643
Huh. And some people
don't believe in luck.

25:43.676 --> 25:44.711
We out of Haldol?

25:44.744 --> 25:45.978
Top drawer.

25:46.012 --> 25:48.681
Chuny forgot to restock.

25:48.715 --> 25:51.217
It's nothing personal, Abby.

25:51.250 --> 25:52.852
I like Dr. Kovac.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.987
Really? It's hard to tell.

25:55.021 --> 25:57.023
He'll be back to work
tomorrow.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.625
We have to do this
every couple of years

25:58.625 --> 25:59.759
to send a message.

25:59.792 --> 26:00.793
Do you even know
what happened?

26:00.827 --> 26:01.994
I don't care
what happened.

26:02.028 --> 26:03.830
Cared enough
to sign a petition.

26:03.863 --> 26:05.898
Another nurse asks
for my support

26:05.932 --> 26:07.667
I'll give it, every time.

26:07.700 --> 26:10.870
Whether she's
right or not?

26:10.903 --> 26:13.640
I've been doing this job
for 17 years, honey.

26:13.640 --> 26:16.809
Doctors come and go,
but nurses make this place run.

26:16.843 --> 26:18.978
We don't get much credit
or much pay.

26:19.011 --> 26:21.347
We see a lot of misery,
a lot of dying

26:21.380 --> 26:23.049
but we come back every day.

26:23.082 --> 26:25.652
I've given up
on being appreciated

26:25.652 --> 26:27.920
but I sure as hell
won't let any of us

26:27.954 --> 26:29.088
be taken for granted.

26:32.992 --> 26:36.228
ALISON:
I can't even get
to the bathroom anymore.

26:36.262 --> 26:39.098
Well, nobody said it
was going to be easy.

26:39.131 --> 26:41.300
But you have a brain
that works

26:41.333 --> 26:42.902
a father who loves you.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.671
You hold on to that.

26:44.704 --> 26:47.674
You hold on to that
as long as you can

26:47.674 --> 26:49.141
and, who knows,
anything could happen.

26:49.175 --> 26:50.009
A cure could happen.

26:50.042 --> 26:51.277
We need to move her.

26:51.310 --> 26:52.912
There are multiple traumas
coming in.

26:52.945 --> 26:55.414
Fine. Just about to head
up to Six West anyway.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.049
Start looking
for that liver.

26:57.083 --> 26:58.317
He's cute but annoying.

26:58.350 --> 26:59.886
Only because I'm right.

26:59.919 --> 27:01.988
Come on, they need
to prep this room.

27:02.021 --> 27:03.422
Have you ever been to the ocean?

27:03.455 --> 27:06.726
Better. I used to have
a lakeside condo.

27:06.759 --> 27:07.894
I dream about it.

27:07.927 --> 27:10.262
I dream I'm down on the bottom

27:10.296 --> 27:13.065
and no matter what,
I can't swim up.

27:13.099 --> 27:17.403
I try to breathe and it's just
water-- breathing water.

27:17.436 --> 27:20.272
And then when
you wake up,
it's true.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.041
But you do wake up.

27:22.074 --> 27:25.011
You know, you open
your eyes, you breathe

27:25.044 --> 27:26.412
it's another day.

27:26.445 --> 27:29.015
That's because
you're still alive.

27:29.048 --> 27:31.383
Your body knows
it isn't over.

27:31.417 --> 27:32.985
Dr. Corday!

27:33.019 --> 27:34.253
What?
She woke up.

27:34.286 --> 27:37.023
( coughing )

27:37.056 --> 27:40.226
CORDAY:
Good.

27:40.259 --> 27:42.895
Very good.

27:42.929 --> 27:45.865
Sara, do you know
where you are?

27:45.898 --> 27:48.334
( weakly ):
Daddy?

27:48.367 --> 27:50.069
You're all right now, honey.

27:50.102 --> 27:52.338
What happened?

27:52.371 --> 27:53.205
Sara, do you know
where you are?

27:53.239 --> 27:54.406
The hospital.

27:54.440 --> 27:55.908
What's the last thing
you remember?

27:55.942 --> 28:00.212
I... I was on the train
with Pat and Andy

28:00.246 --> 28:02.915
going into the city.

28:02.949 --> 28:05.084
My head.

28:05.117 --> 28:06.418
Oh, you hit it outside

28:06.452 --> 28:08.020
on the stairs.

28:08.054 --> 28:09.321
Do you remember anything else?
Anything you did?

28:09.355 --> 28:11.958
No.

28:11.991 --> 28:15.895
No. We were laughing
about something.

28:15.928 --> 28:17.997
And then...

28:18.030 --> 28:19.866
We were laughing.

28:19.899 --> 28:23.035
Sara, we think
there may have been

28:23.069 --> 28:25.104
a drug in your system--
a sedative.

28:25.137 --> 28:28.307
No. I don't do drugs.

28:28.340 --> 28:31.911
Daddy, I don't do drugs.

28:31.944 --> 28:33.445
I know, honey.

28:33.479 --> 28:35.147
Sara, upon examination...

28:35.181 --> 28:36.148
Doctor, um

28:36.182 --> 28:37.249
I need to speak to you outside.

28:37.283 --> 28:38.951
Yes, in a minute.

28:38.985 --> 28:40.987
No, I would like to speak to you
now, please.

28:41.020 --> 28:43.489
Sara, we'll be right back.

28:43.522 --> 28:45.892
Start O2 humidified mask.

28:45.925 --> 28:48.027
I don't want you
to tell her what happened.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.128
We don't know
what happened.

28:49.161 --> 28:50.296
I don't want her to know.

28:50.329 --> 28:51.230
Mr. Paspalis...

28:51.263 --> 28:52.331
Look, I will check her out.

28:52.364 --> 28:54.133
I will take full
responsibility...

28:54.166 --> 28:56.168
Mr. Paspalis,
your daughter was
probably raped.

28:56.202 --> 28:57.804
She could be pregnant.

28:57.837 --> 28:59.839
She might have a sexually
transmitted disease.

28:59.872 --> 29:01.941
I promise you, I will
get her fully checked out.

29:01.974 --> 29:04.276
She may not remember now,
but she could easily...

29:04.310 --> 29:06.045
Look, look,
someone hurt her body.

29:06.078 --> 29:08.080
That doesn't mean
that he has to ruin her life.

29:08.114 --> 29:10.182
Please, I couldn't protect her
from this guy

29:10.216 --> 29:12.551
but if she doesn't know,
I could protect her now.

29:12.584 --> 29:13.920
Dr. Corday.

29:13.953 --> 29:16.555
B.P. 110/70,
pulse 106.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.991
Uh, I'm so sorry.

29:19.025 --> 29:20.292
Can you just
wait here a minute.

29:20.326 --> 29:21.894
Lottery line guy.

29:21.928 --> 29:24.430
Good airway, no L.O.C.
Refused treatment at the site.

29:24.463 --> 29:25.998
You thought
to bring him anyway?

29:26.032 --> 29:27.466
I made an
executive decision.

29:27.499 --> 29:28.567
I'm next in line.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.136
I just want to buy a ticket.

29:30.169 --> 29:32.404
The call was for multiples.
Who's behind you?

29:32.438 --> 29:34.173
No one. Five minors
went to Mercy.

29:34.206 --> 29:36.943
Nine-centimeter penetrating lac
over the right frontal...

29:36.976 --> 29:37.910
Oh, bollocks.

29:37.944 --> 29:38.911
What?

29:38.945 --> 29:41.547
Sir, stay very, very still!

29:41.580 --> 29:43.382
Foreign body goes right through.

29:43.415 --> 29:45.284
More tachy, pulse 120.
Abby...

29:45.317 --> 29:48.888
Abby, your brother's
on the phone.

29:48.921 --> 29:50.222
Lung sounds are clear,
bilaterally.

29:50.256 --> 29:51.290
Maybe the keys don't work.

29:51.323 --> 29:52.391
We'll need a neurosurgeon.

29:52.424 --> 29:54.460
B.P.'s dropping 100/70.
Eric?

29:54.493 --> 29:56.528
ERIC ( over phone ):
Hey, sounds busy.
Should I call back?

29:56.562 --> 29:57.930
What's wrong?

29:57.964 --> 29:59.465
No step off
or other deformity.

29:59.498 --> 30:00.967
I was looking
for the blender.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.501
Mr. Gasmer, when was
your last tetanus?

30:02.534 --> 30:04.403
Yeah, we were thinking
about making milkshakes.

30:04.436 --> 30:06.072
High school, I think.
The blender?

30:06.105 --> 30:07.940
Milkshake sounds
really good.

30:07.974 --> 30:09.575
I think it's
in the cabinet

30:09.608 --> 30:11.243
underneath the coffeemaker.

30:11.277 --> 30:13.379
Mr. Gasmer, we're going
to need to take you

30:13.412 --> 30:15.447
to the operating room
for this.

30:15.481 --> 30:17.149
Aw, jackpot's 87 million.

30:17.183 --> 30:19.251
Hey, your breadmaker's still
in the box.

30:19.285 --> 30:20.586
Sats are at 96. Pulse 110.

30:20.619 --> 30:21.620
Hey, Eric,
how's Jody doing?

30:21.653 --> 30:23.455
Hey, John, she's better.

30:23.489 --> 30:25.958
She was thinking we should go
out tonight, down Navy Pier.

30:25.992 --> 30:27.426
Maybe we can get my sister
to go dancing.

30:27.459 --> 30:29.095
Yeah, she
looks excited.

30:29.128 --> 30:31.597
Abby, get off the phone.
Call for a C.T. scanner.

30:31.630 --> 30:32.598
Ow!

30:32.631 --> 30:33.565
Oh, here it is.

30:33.599 --> 30:34.967
Crisis averted.

30:35.001 --> 30:36.468
They're making
milkshakes.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.204
Okay, let's pack him up to go.

30:38.237 --> 30:40.206
We need Ativan
and an airway box.

30:40.239 --> 30:43.342
Uh, Dr. Carter, Alison Deluca
would like to speak with you.

30:43.375 --> 30:44.911
Is she moving air?

30:44.944 --> 30:46.345
Yeah. Sats 93.
Her temp's down to 99.

30:46.378 --> 30:48.247
Send her home with Biaxin
and a fresh O2 tank.

30:48.280 --> 30:52.018
Uh, she's not ready to go.

30:52.051 --> 30:55.922
She wants a consult
from the transplant service.

30:55.955 --> 31:01.427
Did I say the last
ticket sold is at 6:00?

31:04.931 --> 31:06.565
He did it.
He talked her into it.

31:06.598 --> 31:09.035
She just needed
to regain her strength.

31:09.068 --> 31:11.303
She wants to be considered
for transplant.

31:11.337 --> 31:12.371
She signed a D.N.R.

31:12.404 --> 31:14.006
Well, un-sign it.
Destroy it.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.341
I don't care.

31:15.374 --> 31:16.976
She was upset
for a few hours.

31:17.009 --> 31:20.012
It doesn't disqualify her
for the liver, does it?

31:20.046 --> 31:23.649
No. No, it shouldn't,
but she's not a great candidate.

31:27.954 --> 31:29.989
Please, she wants
to keep fighting.

31:30.022 --> 31:32.624
I'll be in to see her
in a minute.

31:32.658 --> 31:34.426
Would you excuse us.

31:37.329 --> 31:39.966
So do we call UNOS now,
or work her up first?

31:41.467 --> 31:42.701
What are you doing?

31:42.734 --> 31:45.171
She didn't have all the facts.

31:45.204 --> 31:46.973
Do you know what
it's going to take

31:47.006 --> 31:49.041
to keep her alive
for a transplant?

31:49.075 --> 31:50.676
If she even qualifies
for a transplant this time

31:50.709 --> 31:51.543
and they find a match?

31:51.577 --> 31:52.979
It's not worth it?

31:52.979 --> 31:54.213
If there's a shot
at a cure?

31:54.246 --> 31:56.715
She's dying.
She's suffocating.

31:56.748 --> 31:58.217
That's her reality.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.019
Well, there are
a lot of realities.

32:00.052 --> 32:01.287
Stem cell research is a reality.

32:01.320 --> 32:02.688
Stem cells?

32:02.721 --> 32:04.423
It's coming.

32:04.456 --> 32:06.658
Whether the government approves
it or not, it's coming.

32:06.692 --> 32:08.227
You know that.

32:08.260 --> 32:09.295
Embryonic stem cells can be used
to grow

32:09.328 --> 32:10.997
any tissue in the human body.

32:10.997 --> 32:13.032
What, you told her that we could
grow her new lungs?

32:13.065 --> 32:14.733
She's got a genetic disease.

32:14.766 --> 32:18.137
Stem cells can fix
the defect at the
genetic level.

32:18.170 --> 32:19.238
Yeah, maybe, in 50 years.

32:19.271 --> 32:20.472
No, in five years.

32:20.506 --> 32:23.742
The science is there
in five years

32:23.775 --> 32:26.145
Do you know what it took
for her to face her mortality?

32:26.178 --> 32:28.080
I think I do...

32:28.114 --> 32:29.548
For me to convince her father
to accept it?

32:29.581 --> 32:30.449
Oh, this is about your time?

32:30.482 --> 32:31.617
No, this is about you

32:31.650 --> 32:33.352
going in there
with your own agenda

32:33.385 --> 32:34.486
and giving her false hope.

32:34.520 --> 32:36.122
It's not false.

32:36.155 --> 32:38.390
Oh, no? The flowers were
an interesting touch.

32:38.424 --> 32:40.726
Well, you gave her ten minutes.

32:40.759 --> 32:43.495
There is such a thing
as dying with dignity.

32:43.529 --> 32:45.531
Listen, every time
a woman goes in

32:45.564 --> 32:47.366
for in vitro and harvests eggs

32:47.399 --> 32:48.734
there are extra blastocysts...

32:48.767 --> 32:50.469
I know the issues.

32:50.502 --> 32:52.371
She's suffering.
She doesn't care about politics.

32:52.404 --> 32:55.041
It's the politics
that are killing her!

32:55.041 --> 32:58.310
M.I. in one, cured.
All heart disease gone.

32:58.344 --> 33:00.446
Cancer in four, cured.
Alzheimer's, cured.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.648
The spinal cord injury
this morning, cured.

33:02.681 --> 33:05.384
Parkinson's disease.

33:05.417 --> 33:08.320
Cured.

33:08.354 --> 33:09.688
We're out
of business, pal.

33:09.721 --> 33:12.058
I know that you need
to believe that...

33:12.058 --> 33:13.559
Pack up all this crap,
take it away.

33:13.592 --> 33:15.794
And I would love to believe
in miracles, too

33:15.827 --> 33:17.263
but she's dying.

33:17.296 --> 33:18.197
She's dying, Nathan.

33:18.230 --> 33:19.731
And the only question is

33:19.765 --> 33:21.367
how well?

33:21.400 --> 33:26.438
She's 26 years old;
there's no dying well.

33:26.472 --> 33:28.274
You're giving up.

33:30.142 --> 33:32.444
( sighs )

33:34.546 --> 33:36.682
You were perfectly happy
when he was babysitting
your patient.

33:36.715 --> 33:38.217
Because you don't want
to deal with him.

33:38.250 --> 33:39.251
He's spending more
time in the E.R.

33:39.285 --> 33:40.419
than on the
surgical ward.

33:40.452 --> 33:41.720
If her mind was that
easily changed

33:41.753 --> 33:43.155
she wasn't ready
to sign a D.N.R.

33:43.189 --> 33:44.423
Not if he's distorting
reality for her.

33:44.456 --> 33:46.158
He obviously believes
that reality.

33:46.192 --> 33:47.826
It's not gangrene,
but he'll need Unasyn.

33:47.859 --> 33:50.462
Listen, I'm all for big science
and I hope that he's right

33:50.496 --> 33:51.830
but it's not going to save
this girl.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.365
He offered her hope.
Is that so terrible?

33:53.399 --> 33:54.833
For her?
Yeah, it is.

33:54.866 --> 33:58.204
You want him on the ward,
I'll keep him on the ward.

33:58.237 --> 33:59.671
No, just supervise him.

33:59.705 --> 34:01.107
Look, the patients are
who they are.

34:01.140 --> 34:02.208
I can't change
the way he sees them.

34:02.241 --> 34:03.675
Well, it is a teaching hospital.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.711
Quiet, everyone. They're
announcing the numbers.

34:05.744 --> 34:07.179
Hey, move, I can't see.

34:07.213 --> 34:10.482
TV REPORTER:
...$87 million.

34:10.516 --> 34:13.619
To win the jackpot, all you have
to do is match all...

34:14.719 --> 34:16.388
You better watch out.

34:16.422 --> 34:18.590
They're choosing the next
Mega-Millionaire out there.

34:18.623 --> 34:20.559
I thought you already
won the lottery.

34:20.592 --> 34:22.161
Oh, I did, when I met you.

34:22.194 --> 34:24.362
( laughing )

34:24.396 --> 34:25.764
Is this going to be
warm enough?

34:25.797 --> 34:27.132
I don't know.

34:27.166 --> 34:29.235
Who dances outside
in November?

34:29.268 --> 34:30.636
Eskimos.

34:30.668 --> 34:32.504
He doesn't even like
to dance.

34:32.538 --> 34:34.606
Well, love makes you
do crazy things.

34:36.242 --> 34:37.243
What?

34:37.275 --> 34:38.377
Nothing.

34:38.409 --> 34:41.246
I just wish I could...

34:41.280 --> 34:44.382
go be someplace quiet with him.

34:44.416 --> 34:45.717
Well, give her
a chance.

34:45.751 --> 34:48.520
Maybe she's mature beyond
her years.

34:48.554 --> 34:51.322
I know.

34:51.357 --> 34:52.524
( sighs )

34:52.558 --> 34:56.594
It's not her,
really, it's him.

34:58.497 --> 34:59.798
He's acting strange.

34:59.831 --> 35:00.866
Strange how?

35:00.899 --> 35:03.702
You know, flighty...
spontaneous.

35:03.735 --> 35:04.703
Happy?

35:04.736 --> 35:06.372
Too happy.

35:06.405 --> 35:08.707
There's no such thing.

35:08.740 --> 35:14.313
In my family,
yes, there is.

35:17.416 --> 35:20.552
He's what? 27?

35:20.586 --> 35:23.555
Yeah, but he's smoking
and he's flying around in planes

35:23.589 --> 35:25.657
and he has this milkshake
obsession...

35:25.691 --> 35:27.593
( laughs )

35:27.626 --> 35:29.428
What?

35:29.461 --> 35:30.496
Milkshake obsession?

35:30.529 --> 35:31.630
Well...

35:31.663 --> 35:33.299
You don't think
that your radar

35:33.332 --> 35:36.902
might be a
little sensitive?
No.

35:36.935 --> 35:39.905
I don't know, maybe.

35:39.938 --> 35:42.741
Hey...

35:42.774 --> 35:43.909
it's a double date.

35:43.942 --> 35:45.744
I think we can all afford

35:45.777 --> 35:47.879
to have some fun.

35:47.913 --> 35:49.381
Only if you don't
make me dance.

35:49.415 --> 35:50.682
I can't promise
anything.

35:50.716 --> 35:52.618
You have real commitment issues,
you know that?

35:59.991 --> 36:03.495
( sounds of passion )

36:24.350 --> 36:26.518
( moaning )

36:26.552 --> 36:27.986
( door opens )

36:28.019 --> 36:29.621
Yo, Greg! Yo, Greg!

36:29.655 --> 36:31.623
( gasps )
I won! I won, man!

36:31.657 --> 36:32.658
Look at this!

36:32.691 --> 36:33.992
What are you doing here, man?

36:34.025 --> 36:35.327
Get out of here, man.

36:35.361 --> 36:36.728
You're supposed to be
down at...

36:36.762 --> 36:37.763
Who are you?
Get out!

36:37.796 --> 36:38.697
You pretty.
Get out! Get out!

36:38.730 --> 36:39.765
I'm a winner!

36:39.798 --> 36:41.300
What the hell is wrong
with you?

36:41.333 --> 36:42.334
I checked the
number three
times.

36:42.368 --> 36:43.302
Look, I don't care, okay?

36:43.335 --> 36:44.770
Give me some damn privacy.

36:44.803 --> 36:46.272
But I won...
It's all right;
I should go.

36:46.305 --> 36:47.773
No, no, no, no, no.
He's leaving.

36:47.806 --> 36:49.375
Leon, leave,
get out of here.
I'm sorry.

36:49.408 --> 36:50.942
I'm going to see you
at work, all right? Bye.

36:50.976 --> 36:52.678
No, Jing-Mei,
it's-it's...
Ooh, uh...

36:52.711 --> 36:53.979
Well, are you going
to be okay?

36:54.012 --> 36:55.747
Yeah, I'll be fine.
Nice meeting you.

36:55.781 --> 36:58.417
Damn it, Leon.

36:58.450 --> 37:00.686
She was hot.

37:01.653 --> 37:02.721
Anybody win anything?

37:02.754 --> 37:04.556
This place is cursed.

37:04.590 --> 37:06.592
WEAVER:
Abby!
I'm off.

37:06.625 --> 37:08.360
Luka's coming in
for counseling tomorrow.

37:08.394 --> 37:10.596
I want to get him back
on the schedule by Tuesday.

37:10.629 --> 37:11.663
He agreed to that?

37:11.697 --> 37:12.664
Well, reluctantly.

37:12.698 --> 37:16.302
I threw it
on Human Resources

37:16.335 --> 37:17.936
I-I didn't ask to
be nurse manager.

37:17.969 --> 37:19.338
Well, are you quitting?

37:19.371 --> 37:20.739
Do you want me
to quit?
No.

37:20.772 --> 37:23.542
Did you change to go home
and then clock out?

37:23.575 --> 37:24.910
Whatever.

37:24.943 --> 37:26.812
Just set a time to meet with him
after your shift.

37:26.845 --> 37:28.314
Who?
Luka.

37:28.314 --> 37:29.748
( chuckles ):
No, no, no, no.

37:29.781 --> 37:31.783
No, he needs to be counseled
by the nurse manager.

37:31.817 --> 37:33.352
You know that? Maybe
I do want to quit.

37:33.385 --> 37:34.686
It's too late.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.622
Abby, did we get the U.A. back
on the rape exam?

37:36.655 --> 37:37.923
I called down
there twice.

37:37.956 --> 37:39.858
If it's negative,
have Harkins dispo her.

37:39.891 --> 37:41.327
You're sending
her home?

37:41.360 --> 37:42.961
With a head injury
observation chart.

37:42.994 --> 37:44.363
I mean without
telling her.

37:44.396 --> 37:45.731
She's a minor.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.699
What about
emergency
contraception?

37:47.733 --> 37:49.000
It's the end of her cycle.

37:49.034 --> 37:50.869
So you're going to lie
to her?

37:50.902 --> 37:52.638
Her father has the right
to sign her out.

37:52.671 --> 37:54.640
She's a 14-year-old
girl who was raped.

37:54.673 --> 37:55.741
Doesn't she
have any rights?

37:55.774 --> 37:56.708
Just check on the labs.

37:56.742 --> 37:57.709
She wants to go home.

37:57.743 --> 37:58.744
Sorry, I'm off.

37:58.777 --> 37:59.745
What?

37:59.778 --> 38:01.713
ICU admitted Alison.

38:01.747 --> 38:04.516
She's getting her FFP
up there.

38:04.550 --> 38:05.651
Fine.

38:08.754 --> 38:10.356
Congratulations, Mr. Nathan.

38:10.389 --> 38:11.823
You're on call tomorrow night.

38:11.857 --> 38:12.724
Thank you.

38:12.758 --> 38:14.460
32 hours straight.

38:14.493 --> 38:16.395
Go home, get some rest.

38:16.428 --> 38:17.529
You'll need it.

38:17.563 --> 38:19.565
( sighing )

38:21.667 --> 38:23.769
I can't wash my hair?

38:23.802 --> 38:25.604
Only for a few days.

38:25.637 --> 38:28.774
Your pediatrician will
take your stitches out

38:28.807 --> 38:30.542
in a week.

38:31.510 --> 38:33.979
You like being a doctor?

38:34.012 --> 38:37.549
Some days are
better than others.

38:37.583 --> 38:41.653
It must be weird seeing people
naked and stuff.

38:41.687 --> 38:43.622
( chuckles ):
I suppose it's weird.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.691
It depends on the patient.

38:45.724 --> 38:47.993
I don't care
for the hairy ones.

38:48.026 --> 38:49.828
( laughs )

38:53.932 --> 38:59.671
Sara... I have to tell you
something very difficult.

38:59.705 --> 39:02.841
Uh... when we examined you

39:02.874 --> 39:06.778
we found evidence
of sexual assault.

39:06.812 --> 39:08.480
Assault?

39:08.514 --> 39:11.983
Yes, you were raped.

39:12.017 --> 39:14.886
You told my dad
I was raped?

39:14.920 --> 39:16.955
He's just trying
to protect you

39:16.988 --> 39:19.458
but you do have the right
to know.

39:19.491 --> 39:21.593
The scratches, the bruising--

39:21.627 --> 39:23.895
there's more bruising
inside.

39:23.929 --> 39:25.797
You looked inside?

39:25.831 --> 39:27.533
We did a rape exam, yes.

39:27.566 --> 39:28.800
Who said you could?

39:28.834 --> 39:29.635
I didn't say
you could do that.

39:29.668 --> 39:30.902
You were unconscious.

39:30.936 --> 39:32.671
We had to make sure
you weren't injured.

39:32.704 --> 39:34.506
I don't care. I didn't
say you could do that.

39:34.540 --> 39:35.974
Look, I know
this is confusing

39:36.007 --> 39:38.544
and scary and if you'd like
to speak to somebody...

39:38.577 --> 39:41.647
I wasn't raped,
you stupid bitch!

39:41.680 --> 39:44.049
Sara, there were drugs.

39:44.082 --> 39:45.551
Yeah, Special K.

39:45.584 --> 39:48.654
It makes the sex all kind
of swirly.

39:53.825 --> 39:54.793
You took ketamine

39:54.826 --> 39:56.695
and had sexual
intercourse?

39:56.728 --> 40:00.832
It's like having 20 boyfriends
and they all totally love me.

40:00.866 --> 40:03.635
That's incredibly dangerous.

40:03.669 --> 40:06.638
No. I do it every weekend.

40:06.672 --> 40:09.475
You could suffer
from long-term brain damage.

40:09.508 --> 40:10.842
I seize sometimes

40:10.876 --> 40:13.479
but we usually have
Ativan or Xanax.

40:13.512 --> 40:18.517
And... all the guys say
I'm the best.

40:18.550 --> 40:19.785
ERIC:
Catholic school refugees

40:19.818 --> 40:20.819
both of us.

40:20.852 --> 40:22.788
Uh, Abby was completely famous.

40:22.821 --> 40:26.157
She had a Sex Pistols T-shirt
that she wore over her jumper.

40:26.191 --> 40:28.494
( laughs ):
I hope you saved
that uniform.

40:28.527 --> 40:29.828
And you were pretty
bad yourself.

40:29.861 --> 40:31.530
Because you got
caught making out

40:31.563 --> 40:33.965
( laughs ):
with, um... Justine Miceli

40:33.999 --> 40:35.601
in the vestry.

40:35.634 --> 40:38.670
Uh, church always brought
out the romantic in me.

40:38.704 --> 40:39.805
Good to know.

40:39.838 --> 40:40.772
How long
are you guys

40:40.806 --> 40:41.807
going to stay for?

40:41.840 --> 40:43.509
I don't know.
Not so sure.

40:43.542 --> 40:45.010
We still got
some sightseeing
we want to do.

40:45.043 --> 40:47.012
Oh, yeah, I heard
the art museum's really neat.

40:47.045 --> 40:48.914
Yeah, but we're just playing it
by ear, you know?

40:48.947 --> 40:50.849
Hang out for a couple
days before Ohio.

40:50.882 --> 40:52.918
Aren't you due back at the base?

40:52.951 --> 40:54.653
Not for a couple weeks.

40:54.686 --> 40:55.521
I'm on extended leave.

40:55.554 --> 40:56.722
Couple weeks?

40:56.755 --> 40:57.856
Yeah, like I said,
I was overdue.

40:57.889 --> 40:59.925
Did you tell her about
the interview?

40:59.958 --> 41:01.693
Hmm-mm.

41:01.727 --> 41:03.228
What interview?

41:03.261 --> 41:07.533
O'Hare. They're looking
for experienced controllers.

41:08.299 --> 41:09.701
H-Hello.

41:09.735 --> 41:11.603
Don't you
have, like

41:11.637 --> 41:14.773
another year left on your thing?

41:14.806 --> 41:16.542
I do, but I'm just
exploring my options.

41:16.575 --> 41:18.810
You know, I can't stay
in the Air Force forever.

41:18.844 --> 41:19.978
I know, but...

41:20.011 --> 41:21.146
Hey...

41:21.179 --> 41:22.280
Is she always like this?

41:22.313 --> 41:23.615
Don't do that.
You know what

41:23.649 --> 41:24.783
you're a little tense.

41:24.816 --> 41:26.017
I think you and I
should take a spin.

41:26.051 --> 41:27.018
Oh, no, no, no...
Come on.

41:27.052 --> 41:28.754
Do you want me to embarrass you

41:28.787 --> 41:30.822
in front of your boyfriend
by telling more horror stories

41:30.856 --> 41:32.891
from high school?
All right
Stop it.

41:32.924 --> 41:34.693
did you hear about the one time
she almost set

41:34.726 --> 41:35.894
the garage on fire?
Ah, Eric!

41:35.927 --> 41:37.729
She used to like this guy
named Rafe...

41:37.763 --> 41:39.064
Rafe?
Oh, okay, that's it.

41:39.097 --> 41:40.198
No, wait, I want to hear more

41:40.231 --> 41:41.600
about Rafe.
All right.

41:41.633 --> 41:42.834
He was a rocker dude
I said okay!

41:42.868 --> 41:44.770
who wore leather pants.

41:44.803 --> 41:46.838
( country music playing )

41:50.942 --> 41:52.143
She really loves you.

41:52.177 --> 41:53.879
You think so?

41:53.912 --> 41:56.648
Yeah, I mean, you're so
comfortable together, you know?

41:56.682 --> 41:57.816
Intimate.

41:57.849 --> 42:00.786
Without, you know,
needing to show off.

42:00.819 --> 42:02.253
( chuckles )

42:02.287 --> 42:05.190
Uh, Abby says that you guys
have know each other

42:05.223 --> 42:06.625
for a couple weeks.

42:06.658 --> 42:08.293
Yeah.

42:12.263 --> 42:13.999
I love this song.

42:14.032 --> 42:16.935
Don't you love
this song?

42:16.968 --> 42:18.704
Do you want to dance?

42:20.071 --> 42:21.172
Come on, let's dance.

42:21.206 --> 42:22.273
Come on.

42:24.009 --> 42:26.678
Come on.

42:28.914 --> 42:31.249
( clears throat )

42:56.875 --> 42:57.843
Hi.

42:57.876 --> 42:59.778
Hey.

43:06.818 --> 43:10.989
Uh, you hear the organ service
got Alison on the UNOS list?

43:11.022 --> 43:15.727
Yes, I know.
Status two.

43:15.761 --> 43:17.028
It's a nice feeling.

43:17.062 --> 43:18.830
What?

43:18.864 --> 43:22.000
When you realize
you've affected
someone's life.

43:22.033 --> 43:25.804
Touched them
in some way.

43:25.837 --> 43:28.006
You think she'll last
long enough?

43:28.039 --> 43:29.775
One can only hope.

43:29.808 --> 43:32.844
( train approaching )

43:32.878 --> 43:34.145
You on your meds?

43:34.179 --> 43:36.948
Uh, got a little
off schedule.

43:47.859 --> 43:50.095
You can't get up, can you?

43:50.128 --> 43:53.799
I'll catch the next one.

43:53.832 --> 43:54.866
I can wait, if you...

43:54.900 --> 43:55.901
No, no

43:55.934 --> 43:57.102
it's all right.

43:57.135 --> 43:58.336
They'll kick in.

43:58.369 --> 44:00.906
You know, it's a nice night.

44:02.974 --> 44:04.075
It's okay, go ahead.

44:04.109 --> 44:05.443
I'll see you tomorrow.

44:05.476 --> 44:10.849
I expect you will.
