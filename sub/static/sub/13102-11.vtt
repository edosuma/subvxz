00:01.625 --> 00:04.542
[dramatic music]

00:17.458 --> 00:19.417
(Bester)
'A few words for those
who've just arrived.'

00:20.958 --> 00:23.042
A colony of rogue telepaths

00:23.125 --> 00:26.583
have been unwisely allowed
to take up residence here.

00:27.583 --> 00:28.917
Since they're all humans

00:29.000 --> 00:31.125
they fall under
the jurisdiction of Earth law.

00:31.208 --> 00:32.500
And the Alliance has agreed

00:32.583 --> 00:34.417
to respect the rights
of each member world

00:34.500 --> 00:36.375
to control its own people.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.208
This leaves it to us.

00:43.625 --> 00:45.958
The rogues have engaged
in unauthorized scans

00:46.042 --> 00:48.458
of several dozen ambassadors.

00:48.542 --> 00:50.500
They have extracted
an unknown amount

00:50.583 --> 00:52.792
of privileged information..

00:52.875 --> 00:56.208
...intending to exchange
those secrets..

00:56.292 --> 00:59.042
...for a homeworld
of their own.

00:59.125 --> 01:03.125
Since then, they've divided
into two groups.

01:03.208 --> 01:06.708
'Half of them are now
holed up in Downbelow.'

01:06.792 --> 01:09.417
'They have reportedly
begun a hunger strike'

01:09.500 --> 01:13.292
'which they believe will create
sympathy for their cause.'

01:13.375 --> 01:15.042
This is all fine by me.

01:15.125 --> 01:17.792
Since it means that group one
is already contained.

01:18.625 --> 01:20.750
Saving us the trouble.

01:20.833 --> 01:23.458
Also, the longer they continue
their hunger strike..

01:23.542 --> 01:25.708
...the weaker their
condition becomes..

01:25.792 --> 01:27.250
...the less resistance
we'll encounter

01:27.333 --> 01:28.500
when we go in after them.

01:30.083 --> 01:32.542
Group number two
is our main concern.

01:32.625 --> 01:35.417
'Group two, the rest of
Byron's followers..'

01:35.500 --> 01:37.958
'...have scattered
throughout the station.'

01:38.042 --> 01:41.208
'Several Bloodhound units
are already on patrol'

01:41.292 --> 01:43.667
'running them to ground.'

01:43.750 --> 01:46.667
Several of them broke
into an armory last night

01:46.750 --> 01:50.750
seizing an unknown number
of PPG rifles and handguns.

01:50.833 --> 01:54.000
We believe only a small portion
of them are armed.

01:54.083 --> 01:57.333
'Fortunately, there seems to be
little tactical coordination'

01:57.417 --> 01:59.625
'between the members
of group two.'

01:59.708 --> 02:01.542
'This should make them
easier to bring down.'

02:05.208 --> 02:06.792
[alarm blaring]

02:10.625 --> 02:13.833
We should expect
some losses on their side..

02:13.917 --> 02:16.250
...but let's try to keep it
within acceptable limits.

02:18.333 --> 02:20.417
The Corps is mother.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.458
The Corps is father.

02:22.542 --> 02:26.208
In that way,
these are our children..

02:26.292 --> 02:27.792
...who have gone astray.

02:29.125 --> 02:32.667
We have to at least try
to bring them in alive..

02:34.500 --> 02:36.375
...so that we can
correct their thinking.

02:38.583 --> 02:40.125
'The data packets
you've received'

02:40.208 --> 02:41.875
'detail which part
of the station'

02:41.958 --> 02:44.292
you've been
assigned to cover..

02:44.375 --> 02:46.750
...and pair you up with
one of the Bloodhound units.

02:49.167 --> 02:52.542
I want this situation
resolved by tomorrow morning.

02:53.125 --> 02:54.458
Latest.

02:56.417 --> 02:57.625
Dismissed.

03:01.458 --> 03:03.417
You enjoy this, don't you?

03:03.500 --> 03:06.083
The drama, the chase.

03:06.167 --> 03:10.625
I enjoy being good
at what I do.

03:10.708 --> 03:13.333
And you should take some
small pleasure in it as well.

03:13.417 --> 03:15.625
This is for
your benefit, after all.

03:15.708 --> 03:20.500
Our job is to protect normals
from rogue telepaths.

03:20.583 --> 03:24.125
'Perhaps now you'll understand
why we're necessary.'

03:24.208 --> 03:26.667
Every race
to develop telepaths

03:26.750 --> 03:30.042
has had to find some way
to control them.

03:30.125 --> 03:33.458
Through laws,
religion, drugs..

03:34.375 --> 03:35.458
...or extermination.

03:37.417 --> 03:38.667
We may not be pretty..

03:43.375 --> 03:45.875
...but we're a hell of a lot
better than the alternatives.

03:47.375 --> 03:48.500
Maybe so.

03:49.792 --> 03:52.625
But I don't have to
like your methods.

03:52.708 --> 03:55.125
We shouldn't be
run down like mad dogs.

03:55.208 --> 03:57.167
If they insist on
behaving like mad dogs

03:57.250 --> 03:59.000
we have to
treat them as such.

03:59.083 --> 04:02.542
Look, captain,
you called me, remember?

04:02.625 --> 04:05.250
Now that we're here,
we'll handle it our way.

04:05.333 --> 04:07.458
And our way
always works.

04:07.542 --> 04:08.625
Because whatever
our differences

04:08.708 --> 04:11.625
those rogues
are telepaths

04:11.708 --> 04:14.167
and that puts us on
the same side.

04:14.250 --> 04:16.000
We just have to help them
understand that.

04:16.083 --> 04:17.167
[beeping]

04:21.708 --> 04:23.333
I have a hunch that
might be more difficult

04:23.417 --> 04:24.875
than you think, Mr. Bester.

04:29.542 --> 04:31.292
(Kosh)
'And so it begins.'

04:31.375 --> 04:32.667
(male #1)
There's a hole in your mind.

04:32.750 --> 04:34.375
(Sinclair)
What do you want?

04:34.458 --> 04:36.167
(G'Kar)
No one here is exactly
what he appears.

04:36.250 --> 04:38.125
(Sinclair)
Nothing's the same anymore.

04:38.208 --> 04:39.958
(Hague)
'Commander Sinclair
is being reassigned.'

04:40.042 --> 04:41.542
Why don't you eliminate
the entire Narn homeworld?

04:41.625 --> 04:43.542
(Elric)
I see a great hand

04:43.625 --> 04:44.958
reaching out of the stars.

04:45.042 --> 04:46.667
Who are you?

04:46.750 --> 04:48.667
President Clark's signed a
decree declaring martial law.

04:48.750 --> 04:51.250
These orders have forced us
to declare independence.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.000
(Sheridan)
Unless your people get off
their encounter-suited

04:53.083 --> 04:54.042
butts and do something.

04:54.125 --> 04:55.542
You're the one who was.

04:55.625 --> 04:58.333
(Kosh)
lf you go to Z'Ha'Dum,
you will die.

04:58.417 --> 04:59.833
(Lorien)
Why are you here?

04:59.917 --> 05:02.042
Do you have anything
worth living for?

05:02.125 --> 05:03.833
(Delenn)
I think of my
beautiful city in flames.

05:03.917 --> 05:05.083
(Sheridan)
Giants in the playground.

05:05.167 --> 05:07.125
Now, get out of our galaxy!

05:07.208 --> 05:09.750
We are here to place
President Clark under arrest.

05:09.833 --> 05:12.667
[theme music]

05:38.833 --> 05:41.917
[music continues]

06:05.792 --> 06:07.042
- Any news?
- We just heard.

06:07.125 --> 06:09.250
Byron wants to talk to us.
He's on channel four.

06:09.333 --> 06:11.792
Good. Maybe we can negotiate
our way out of this.

06:13.833 --> 06:15.750
Mr. President,
sorry to bother you.

06:15.833 --> 06:18.375
It's a little late
to worry about that now.

06:18.458 --> 06:20.125
Byron, I trusted you.

06:20.208 --> 06:23.458
I let you form a colony here,
gave you a place to stay.

06:23.542 --> 06:25.458
And now your people are turning
this place upside down.

06:25.542 --> 06:26.625
They've killed four people.

06:26.708 --> 06:29.125
The situation has
gotten out of control.

06:29.208 --> 06:32.208
And so have my people,
at least the ones out there.

06:32.292 --> 06:35.958
I can help, but you have to
remove the Psi Cops first.

06:36.042 --> 06:37.458
I can't do that.

06:37.542 --> 06:39.875
As long as they're here,
the violence will continue.

06:39.958 --> 06:41.833
My people will do
anything necessary

06:41.917 --> 06:44.042
to keep from going back
to the Psi Corps.

06:44.125 --> 06:47.167
I believe I can get them to back
off if I talk to them directly.

06:47.250 --> 06:50.333
'But if any of us try to
leave here, we'll be arrested.'

06:50.417 --> 06:51.833
I wouldn't believe him,
Mr. President.

06:54.958 --> 06:57.250
Byron never keeps
his promises.

06:57.333 --> 07:00.083
- Do you, Byron?
- This doesn't concern you.

07:00.167 --> 07:02.250
Oh, but it does.

07:02.333 --> 07:05.083
You want us to leave
so that you can get away.

07:05.167 --> 07:06.542
Not a chance.

07:06.625 --> 07:09.208
Your followers killed
at least four people.

07:09.292 --> 07:11.375
And even the president..

07:11.458 --> 07:13.750
...despite his liberal
attitudes..

07:13.833 --> 07:16.375
...knows that you can't
let killers get away.

07:16.458 --> 07:19.000
Stay there
and we'll dig you out.

07:19.083 --> 07:21.708
Come out
and we'll arrest you.

07:21.792 --> 07:25.292
Either way,
it's over, Byron.

07:25.375 --> 07:27.958
No. There are other ways.

07:28.042 --> 07:29.583
Byron, you..

07:33.333 --> 07:35.125
What did he mean, Byron..

07:35.208 --> 07:37.333
...about you not
keeping your promises?

07:37.417 --> 07:40.333
Later. We have to go now.

07:45.083 --> 07:46.917
Thanks for the help.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.917
We were finally
opening up a dialogue.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.875
I don't believe in dialogue,
only action.

07:52.958 --> 07:54.208
That's what I'm here for.

07:54.292 --> 07:56.542
To give you a progress report
on our activities.

07:58.833 --> 08:02.250
Don't worry, captain.
This'll be over by morning.

08:05.083 --> 08:07.917
I get the feeling
he wants this confrontation.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.583
There's something personal
in this for him.

08:10.667 --> 08:12.458
Speaking of personal grudges

08:12.542 --> 08:15.625
you seen or heard of Garibaldi
since Bester came on board?

08:15.708 --> 08:18.458
No. I thought you would
have heard from him by now.

08:18.542 --> 08:21.708
You're right.
That's what's got me worried.

08:21.792 --> 08:23.000
There's only one thing
more dangerous

08:23.083 --> 08:25.250
than Mr. Garibaldi
when he's loud.

08:26.708 --> 08:28.500
It's when he's dead silent.

08:35.375 --> 08:37.250
Turn around.

08:37.333 --> 08:40.917
Very, very slowly.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.542
Hello, Mr. Garibaldi.

08:44.708 --> 08:46.250
Good to see you again.

08:46.333 --> 08:47.917
I was wondering
how you were doing.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.167
You haven't written,
you haven't called--

08:50.250 --> 08:51.708
Shut up.

08:51.792 --> 08:53.875
Obviously haven't
improved your manners.

08:53.958 --> 08:56.125
I want you to go over
to the Babcom unit.

09:00.667 --> 09:01.833
'Hit the record button.'

09:04.708 --> 09:06.250
(automated message)
'Standing by to record.'

09:06.333 --> 09:09.292
'Touch "Record" a second time
to initiate recording.'

09:09.375 --> 09:12.500
Now, I want you to dictate
a full confession.

09:12.583 --> 09:13.917
I want you to tell
the whole truth

09:14.000 --> 09:16.208
about what you did
to me and to Sheridan.

09:16.292 --> 09:18.125
What I did?

09:18.208 --> 09:20.208
Oh, you mean the part
about my conditioning

09:20.292 --> 09:21.583
you to turn against
your friends

09:21.667 --> 09:23.958
sell out Sheridan
to President Clark

09:24.042 --> 09:27.125
and infiltrate a conspiracy
against my beloved Psi Corps.

09:27.208 --> 09:30.208
Yeah, that's the one. Now, hit
the button and say it again.

09:35.083 --> 09:35.958
No.

09:36.042 --> 09:39.083
This isn't a discussion, Bester.

09:39.167 --> 09:41.625
Yes, it is.

09:41.708 --> 09:44.167
You won't shoot.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.000
Don't count on it.

09:46.083 --> 09:49.333
If anybody asks, I'll just
say it was self-defense.

09:49.417 --> 09:53.750
And there's nobody who loves you
enough to even question it.

09:53.833 --> 09:56.208
See, the truth is..

09:56.292 --> 09:58.042
...I don't care if I go
up for your murder or not.

09:58.125 --> 10:00.250
Not after what you did to me.

10:01.750 --> 10:05.625
I've thought about this
for a long, long time, Bester.

10:05.708 --> 10:07.542
And either you do
what I say right now..

10:09.083 --> 10:10.208
..or I'll kill you.

10:12.083 --> 10:13.375
I mean it.

10:13.458 --> 10:15.833
Yes.

10:15.917 --> 10:17.042
I believe you do.

10:18.875 --> 10:20.958
But my answer is still no.

10:22.417 --> 10:25.833
So, I guess..

10:25.917 --> 10:28.042
...you're just going
to have to shoot me.

10:28.125 --> 10:29.708
[dramatic music]

10:40.792 --> 10:43.000
Let me ask you something,
Mr. Garibaldi.

10:44.292 --> 10:46.583
A purely philosophical question.

10:49.542 --> 10:51.625
On a scale of one to 10..

10:57.333 --> 11:00.375
...how stupid do you
think I am, anyway?

11:00.458 --> 11:02.542
Do you really think
I'd let you run around

11:02.625 --> 11:03.792
knowing what you know..

11:03.875 --> 11:05.458
...and leave you free
to kill me?

11:07.625 --> 11:12.750
- What have you done to me?
- I hit you with an Asimov.

11:12.833 --> 11:16.583
He was a writer long ago
who wrote stories about robots.

11:16.667 --> 11:17.917
He came up
with a set of rules

11:18.000 --> 11:21.417
to prevent them from
turning against mankind.

11:21.500 --> 11:25.458
The cybertechs adopted them in
the early pre-ban experiments

11:25.542 --> 11:28.167
and I've found them useful
myself from time to time.

11:30.583 --> 11:34.208
'Before we finished
adjusting you, I made sure'

11:34.292 --> 11:38.417
'we planted Asimov's two most
important rules in your mind.'

11:38.500 --> 11:40.583
You cannot harm me directly..

11:40.667 --> 11:42.875
...or through inaction

11:42.958 --> 11:45.750
allow harm to come to me.

11:45.833 --> 11:47.417
To make it harder
for someone else

11:47.500 --> 11:49.333
to break the conditioning..

11:49.417 --> 11:52.125
...I put the block
in the part of your brain

11:52.208 --> 11:54.917
that controls
the neural system.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.958
'You can want to kill me
as much as you want..'

11:58.042 --> 11:59.708
'...the same way I can say'

11:59.792 --> 12:01.458
"I wanna raise this hand."

12:02.708 --> 12:04.583
But it won't lift up..

12:04.667 --> 12:06.833
...until I send the impulse.

12:10.417 --> 12:13.667
You're blocked
at the point of action..

12:13.750 --> 12:16.458
...but I left your rage intact.

12:16.542 --> 12:18.375
'Call it..

12:18.458 --> 12:20.417
...counterpoint.'

12:20.500 --> 12:22.042
Dramatic irony.

12:25.542 --> 12:26.625
Well..

12:27.958 --> 12:30.333
...I'd love to stay
and chat, Mr. Garibaldi

12:30.417 --> 12:32.792
but I just have
so much work to do.

12:32.875 --> 12:37.792
Oh, um, be sure and turn out
the lights on your way out.

12:46.583 --> 12:49.458
[zapping]

12:57.583 --> 12:59.708
(Byron)
'This isn't what
I wanted, Lyta.'

12:59.792 --> 13:01.583
I tried to teach them.

13:01.667 --> 13:04.667
To show them that there is
another way than violence.

13:04.750 --> 13:06.333
Did I fail that badly?

13:06.417 --> 13:09.333
You can't change
human nature, Byron.

13:09.417 --> 13:11.625
Then there's not much point
in living, is there?

13:11.708 --> 13:13.625
If we can't hope for
something better

13:13.708 --> 13:15.750
something nobler, at least
something kinder?

13:20.583 --> 13:23.250
You still haven't
answered my question.

13:23.333 --> 13:26.708
What did Bester mean about you
not keeping your promises?

13:26.792 --> 13:28.875
It seemed as if he knew you.

13:28.958 --> 13:31.208
The tone in his voice, it..

13:31.292 --> 13:34.833
It was almost as if this were
something personal to him.

13:35.458 --> 13:37.375
It is.

13:37.458 --> 13:39.875
Very personal.

13:39.958 --> 13:41.125
Why?

13:43.375 --> 13:45.167
You shouldn't ask questions
that will lead

13:45.250 --> 13:47.000
to answers you don't
want to hear.

13:50.333 --> 13:51.542
Byron.

13:57.792 --> 14:00.833
I want to hear it,
whatever it is.

14:03.375 --> 14:07.208
I grew up in the Psi Corps,
same as you.

14:07.292 --> 14:09.375
Do you know my rating
as a telepath?

14:10.458 --> 14:12.417
I'm a strong P-12.

14:12.500 --> 14:15.333
But all P-12s
are automatically designated..

14:16.667 --> 14:19.042
...Psi Cops.

14:19.125 --> 14:22.250
- You were a Psi Cop?
- Not just a Psi Cop.

14:22.333 --> 14:24.500
Bester's protege.

14:24.583 --> 14:26.917
He was training me
to be just like him.

14:28.292 --> 14:31.792
And I was.
For a long time.

14:31.875 --> 14:33.167
And then..

14:36.042 --> 14:38.667
It was supposed to be
a simple interception.

14:38.750 --> 14:40.792
We'd gotten word
about a covert operation

14:40.875 --> 14:43.292
smuggling telepaths into
some of the outer colonies

14:43.375 --> 14:46.375
where it would be harder
for us to find them.

14:46.458 --> 14:47.792
'We surrounded the transport'

14:47.875 --> 14:49.833
'and demanded they
turn over the telepaths.'

14:49.917 --> 14:51.750
'Or we would use deadly force.'

14:53.042 --> 14:55.292
'They did as they were told.'

14:55.375 --> 14:56.625
'They didn't have much choice.'

14:56.708 --> 15:00.125
Omega 7 to Omega 1.
Blips are clear.

15:00.208 --> 15:02.417
Captured transport
moving into position.

15:09.208 --> 15:11.458
'All clear.
We can head back now.'

15:11.542 --> 15:14.125
Not yet, Omega 7.

15:14.208 --> 15:17.292
'We got this batch,
but there'll be others.'

15:17.375 --> 15:21.333
- 'We need to send a message.'
- Alright.

15:21.417 --> 15:23.125
I'll arrange for them
to be escorted to--

15:23.208 --> 15:25.083
(Bester)
'Negative, Omega 7.'

15:25.167 --> 15:29.250
'Lock all forward weapons on
transport. Prepare to fire.'

15:29.333 --> 15:31.750
Sir, they're unarmed.
We can't just--

15:31.833 --> 15:33.875
(Bester)
'Prepare to fire, Omega 7.'

15:40.583 --> 15:43.625
- I can't.
- 'I gave you an order, Byron.'

15:43.708 --> 15:46.083
'Execute the order
or face the consequences.'

15:52.083 --> 15:53.208
They're just mundanes, Byron.

15:54.792 --> 15:57.417
And it's them or you.

15:57.500 --> 16:00.375
You wanted to run
with the big boys?

16:00.458 --> 16:03.042
Now you have to show
that you're up to it.

16:03.125 --> 16:05.542
'Are you?'

16:05.625 --> 16:08.083
'Are you up to it, Byron?'

16:08.167 --> 16:10.458
I knew he was serious.

16:10.542 --> 16:12.875
Knew he wanted me bloody,
just like him.

16:12.958 --> 16:16.708
I knew they would kill me
if I didn't do as I was told.

16:16.792 --> 16:19.083
So..

16:19.167 --> 16:20.708
...God help me,
I pulled the trigger.

16:20.792 --> 16:21.958
[firing]

16:22.042 --> 16:24.000
After all, they were
just mundanes.

16:29.458 --> 16:32.458
[explosion]

16:34.875 --> 16:36.708
When I got back..

16:36.792 --> 16:40.000
...I tried to file a report
on what had happened.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.667
But nobody wanted to know.

16:42.750 --> 16:44.625
So, I left.

16:44.708 --> 16:48.042
I swore I'd never let innocents
be harmed like that again.

16:48.125 --> 16:51.917
Swore to find a better way
for us, for our people.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.583
Without violence, without
preying on our own kind

16:54.667 --> 16:57.583
or letting others
prey on us.

16:57.667 --> 16:58.833
Do the others know?

17:01.667 --> 17:03.208
They have been my salvation.

17:04.875 --> 17:07.417
I gave them direction

17:07.500 --> 17:09.250
organization, strength.

17:10.875 --> 17:12.500
But they gave me hope.

17:15.375 --> 17:17.375
And look where
I've brought them in return.

17:25.375 --> 17:26.625
I got them! I got them!

17:28.792 --> 17:31.792
'Cover me.'

17:31.875 --> 17:32.958
Now, go. Go!

17:34.583 --> 17:36.458
They cut off the other hall. We
can't go back the way we came.

17:36.542 --> 17:37.917
Reinforcements?

17:38.000 --> 17:40.083
They're bringing in another
dozen security guards.

17:40.167 --> 17:42.375
- Thomas, we're outnumbered.
- We need to fall back.

17:42.458 --> 17:45.292
Consolidate our forces,
buy a little insurance.

17:45.375 --> 17:47.583
They may not value our lives,
but the mundanes?

17:47.667 --> 17:48.958
That's a different question.

17:49.042 --> 17:51.125
The captain will never let
anything happen to them.

17:51.208 --> 17:52.958
And I think I know
where we can get some.

17:53.042 --> 17:55.125
Alright, everybody,
fall out!

17:55.208 --> 17:57.208
- Let's go!
- Hurry! Come on!

17:57.292 --> 17:58.958
Let's move!

17:59.042 --> 18:00.167
Move!

18:02.542 --> 18:04.833
Coming through.
Coming through.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.917
Watch it.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Doc. Got a second?

18:09.083 --> 18:11.167
Well, yeah, but we're
getting a lot of wounded.

18:11.250 --> 18:13.042
What do you know
about neural blocks?

18:13.125 --> 18:14.667
[dramatic music]

18:19.458 --> 18:21.833
What kind? Chemical,
telepathic, biomechanical?

18:21.917 --> 18:24.833
Telepathic. Are there drugs that
can overcome a telepathic block?

18:24.917 --> 18:26.250
Well, it depends.

18:26.333 --> 18:28.292
[screaming]

18:28.375 --> 18:30.167
Close the door!

18:30.250 --> 18:32.292
[dramatic music]

18:33.417 --> 18:35.458
[clamoring]

18:49.833 --> 18:52.375
Enough. That's enough.
We need them alive.

18:56.625 --> 19:00.042
Thomas, this is Garibaldi.
He works for the president.

19:00.125 --> 19:01.833
And we have the main doctor too.

19:01.917 --> 19:03.125
Good.

19:03.208 --> 19:04.500
I'd hoped for some
valuable hostages

19:04.583 --> 19:06.875
but I never thought
we'd come up aces.

19:06.958 --> 19:09.250
Get the president and
the captain on the line.

19:09.333 --> 19:10.875
Tell them we now have hostages

19:10.958 --> 19:14.000
and if we don't get what
we want, they're all dead.

19:16.750 --> 19:18.792
Starting with you.

19:21.250 --> 19:23.667
And then...you.

19:29.250 --> 19:30.458
(Thomas on TV)
'Unless our demands are met'

19:30.542 --> 19:31.583
we will begin
killing the hostages

19:31.667 --> 19:33.083
starting with Garibaldi.

19:33.167 --> 19:35.958
We demand the release of
Byron and all others like us

19:36.042 --> 19:38.042
who have been
taken into custody.

19:38.125 --> 19:41.083
Safe passage off Babylon 5
to neutral territory

19:41.167 --> 19:43.000
and the commencement
of negotiations

19:43.083 --> 19:45.958
aimed toward creating
a homeworld for telepaths.

19:46.042 --> 19:48.708
You have two hours to comply

19:48.792 --> 19:52.083
'or we will begin
the executions.'

19:52.167 --> 19:53.417
And don't think for a minute

19:53.500 --> 19:56.083
we'll hesitate to do
exactly as I say.

19:56.167 --> 19:59.458
- After all, to us..
- They're only mundanes.

19:59.542 --> 20:01.792
They're only mundanes.

20:03.875 --> 20:07.125
No! I swore an oath, Lyta.

20:07.208 --> 20:09.125
I won't let it happen.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.125
Not to mundanes,
not to our people

20:11.208 --> 20:14.125
and by God, I won't let it
happen in my name.

20:14.208 --> 20:15.750
Could you tell
where they were?

20:15.833 --> 20:18.292
It was difficult,
but I think it was Medlab one.

20:18.375 --> 20:19.583
Can you get me there?

20:19.667 --> 20:21.375
Byron, we sealed ourselves
off in here.

20:21.458 --> 20:23.208
We welded half
the doors shut.

20:23.292 --> 20:25.458
The other half are
guarded by Psi Cops. I--

20:25.542 --> 20:27.083
There must be other ways.

20:27.167 --> 20:28.625
Ways too small
for them to bother with.

20:28.708 --> 20:30.333
Ways that fell
between the cracks.

20:30.417 --> 20:33.792
Air ducts, maintenance halls,
a crawlspace, anything.

20:33.875 --> 20:35.708
You have to get me
into Medlab, Lyta.

20:35.792 --> 20:39.208
I won't have innocent blood on
my hands a second time. I won't!

20:41.250 --> 20:43.625
I know it hurts, Peter,
but we need you.

20:43.708 --> 20:46.458
Byron needs you, Thomas needs
you, we all need you.

20:46.542 --> 20:48.792
There's a major access hall
that we can't guard properly.

20:48.875 --> 20:51.167
And we need you
and your special gift.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.208
Oh, I'll try.

20:53.292 --> 20:55.542
You can't take
that man out of here.

20:55.625 --> 20:57.583
He's not well enough to move.
Now, his injuries--

20:57.667 --> 20:59.875
Stephen!

20:59.958 --> 21:02.333
His injuries will be far less
than yours or theirs

21:02.417 --> 21:04.167
if you try to interfere
with us again.

21:10.250 --> 21:13.292
[all grunting]

21:15.250 --> 21:16.583
Try that again

21:16.667 --> 21:19.000
and we'll kill five at a time
instead of just one.

21:19.083 --> 21:20.250
Get him out of here.

21:23.792 --> 21:25.208
There's one telepath
I can't kill

21:25.292 --> 21:27.208
but nobody said
anything about you.

21:27.292 --> 21:28.542
You hurt these people..

21:30.583 --> 21:33.000
...you'll go to your grave
with my teeth in your throat.

21:35.792 --> 21:37.792
[dramatic music]

21:47.708 --> 21:50.208
We've got movement.
Could be trouble.

21:50.292 --> 21:52.250
[music continues]

22:02.042 --> 22:04.083
[zapping]

22:09.000 --> 22:10.333
Chief, I've got to go down!

22:15.292 --> 22:17.417
Fall back!

22:17.500 --> 22:19.792
- Fall back to Blue four!
- Go! Go! Go!

22:25.667 --> 22:27.250
That's very good.

22:27.333 --> 22:29.750
We'll go tell Thomas
the hallway is secure.

22:29.833 --> 22:33.458
Remember, Peter,
nobody gets by.

22:33.542 --> 22:36.917
- You understand?
- N-no one.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.042
Okay.

22:43.333 --> 22:45.583
(Bester)
'I tried to warn you,
Mr. President.'

22:45.667 --> 22:48.167
You can't trust
Byron or his people.

22:48.250 --> 22:50.250
Now you see that I was right.

22:50.333 --> 22:51.917
And maybe we could have
avoided this

22:52.000 --> 22:54.500
if we'd opened negotiations.

22:54.583 --> 22:58.208
You can't talk to them.
You can talk to her.

22:58.292 --> 23:01.083
You can talk to me.
Everyone talks to me.

23:01.167 --> 23:02.875
People like talking to me.

23:02.958 --> 23:05.792
I guess I just have
that kind of face.

23:05.875 --> 23:08.833
But you can't talk to them.
They can't be trusted.

23:08.917 --> 23:10.792
Just leave it to us.

23:10.875 --> 23:12.333
And if Garibaldi is killed?

23:13.750 --> 23:15.667
Zack gets his room.

23:17.417 --> 23:20.417
Look, this is all
very fascinating

23:20.500 --> 23:22.625
but the latest
from Earthgov confirms

23:22.708 --> 23:25.125
that I still have jurisdiction
over the situation.

23:25.208 --> 23:28.542
So, until that changes..

23:28.625 --> 23:30.708
...we'll play it my way.

23:36.167 --> 23:38.250
Is that true?

23:38.333 --> 23:39.875
Have you heard back from
President Luchenko?

23:39.958 --> 23:41.917
They've confirmed
receiving our request

23:42.000 --> 23:43.167
to shut down
Bester's operation.

23:43.250 --> 23:44.500
They say they're
considering it.

23:44.583 --> 23:46.333
We should know
in a few hours.

23:46.417 --> 23:48.833
Yeah, and Garibaldi
has less than two hours left.

23:48.917 --> 23:51.792
I know, but if we go in there
while Bester's still in charge

23:51.875 --> 23:54.500
they will panic
and kill the hostages.

23:54.583 --> 23:56.792
Unless we wanna give in,
give them what they want.

23:57.917 --> 23:59.708
Do we?

23:59.792 --> 24:02.792
Do we want to negotiate with
terrorists, Mr. President?

24:10.167 --> 24:13.208
[dramatic music]

24:33.208 --> 24:35.042
Can't get out that way.
It's blocked.

24:37.500 --> 24:40.542
[dramatic music]

25:01.625 --> 25:03.875
This one. This will do it.

25:12.667 --> 25:13.917
Time's almost up.

25:24.125 --> 25:25.458
Oh, Byron.
How did you get through?

25:25.542 --> 25:26.583
I don't have time.

25:26.667 --> 25:28.542
- Are they still in there?
- Yes.

25:28.625 --> 25:30.250
They said no one
was to get past me, though.

25:30.333 --> 25:33.583
I'm sure they didn't include me
in that, Peter. It's alright.

25:33.667 --> 25:35.958
I've always tried to do
the right thing, Byron.

25:36.042 --> 25:39.042
- Always.
- I know.

25:45.792 --> 25:49.667
(Garibaldi)
'You gotta listen to me.
This isn't gonna work.'

25:49.750 --> 25:51.792
Now, if you give yourselves up,
we could go back.

25:51.875 --> 25:53.167
We could talk to the others.

25:58.375 --> 26:01.417
You say you're doing
this for a cause.

26:01.500 --> 26:02.833
What kind of sympathy
are you gonna get

26:02.917 --> 26:06.542
by killing innocent
people in cold blood?

26:06.625 --> 26:09.125
You wanna send out a message,
this ain't it.

26:10.167 --> 26:11.667
Look, I can work with you.

26:11.750 --> 26:14.417
I can get you out of this,
but you've gotta work with me.

26:16.042 --> 26:17.167
What do you say?

26:23.292 --> 26:24.833
Yeah.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.500
That's what I thought
you were gonna say.

26:27.667 --> 26:29.958
This is President Sheridan.

26:30.042 --> 26:31.750
I've consulted with
Captain Lochley

26:31.833 --> 26:36.000
and we have reached a decision
regarding the current situation.

26:36.083 --> 26:38.000
It is not the policy

26:38.083 --> 26:40.667
of the Interstellar Alliance
or this station

26:40.750 --> 26:44.333
to bargain with terrorists
for the lives of hostages.

26:44.417 --> 26:46.375
If we open
that door even once

26:46.458 --> 26:48.833
we will never be able
to close it again.

26:48.917 --> 26:51.167
You have two choices.

26:51.250 --> 26:52.667
Surrender..

26:52.750 --> 26:56.708
...or we will use lethal force
to bring you down.

26:56.792 --> 26:58.583
You have 10 minutes.

27:02.500 --> 27:03.542
Swell.

27:06.333 --> 27:07.667
Ah, whoa!

27:07.750 --> 27:08.875
Wait, look, we can...

27:08.958 --> 27:10.583
[zapping]

27:22.542 --> 27:23.958
It's almost 10 minutes.
Why don't they answer?

27:29.333 --> 27:30.833
Did you know that..

27:30.917 --> 27:32.875
...Garibaldi has been
here longer than

27:32.958 --> 27:34.875
anyone else
in the command structure?

27:34.958 --> 27:37.083
Yeah. He came on board
with Sinclair.

27:38.792 --> 27:41.542
And despite a history
of alcohol abuse

27:41.625 --> 27:46.333
despite being shot,
stabbed, beaten up..

27:46.417 --> 27:49.167
...he has survived
five years in this place.

27:54.458 --> 27:58.000
I-if I am responsible
for changing that, if he..

28:03.500 --> 28:05.250
I don't know that I can
live with myself, captain.

28:08.042 --> 28:09.792
You made the right decision.

28:11.042 --> 28:12.958
There was nothing else
you could do.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.250
(Sheridan)
'Yeah?'

28:17.125 --> 28:18.417
Yeah, well, it's
a great epitaph

28:18.500 --> 28:20.500
but it is a lousy thing
to do to a friend.

28:23.375 --> 28:24.750
Lochley. Go.

28:24.833 --> 28:25.792
'We've got a response coming in'

28:25.875 --> 28:28.208
'from the telepaths in Medlab.'

28:28.292 --> 28:29.375
Put it through.

28:31.083 --> 28:33.958
Byron. I didn't expect
to see you there.

28:34.042 --> 28:36.292
- How did you--
- How doesn't matter.

28:36.375 --> 28:39.333
The immediate situation
has been resolved.

28:39.417 --> 28:41.083
But I need your help
to end this.

28:41.167 --> 28:43.917
I will arrange
to have the hostages released.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.125
But in exchange, I want to

28:46.208 --> 28:48.333
gather all my people
together in Downbelow.

28:48.417 --> 28:50.833
Talk to them,
bring this to a peaceful end.

28:50.917 --> 28:52.417
That means no interference.

28:52.500 --> 28:54.125
If your people
or Bester interfere

28:54.208 --> 28:55.833
I won't be able
to control them.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.333
After we've had
some time together

28:59.417 --> 29:02.458
I and those directly responsible
for the recent violence

29:02.542 --> 29:04.667
will surrender.

29:04.750 --> 29:07.208
Okay. What's the condition?

29:07.292 --> 29:10.542
I want your personal guarantee
that the rest of my people

29:10.625 --> 29:11.792
those who've harmed no one

29:11.875 --> 29:14.000
will be allowed to leave
the station in peace.

29:14.083 --> 29:16.500
And we will only surrender
to you, not the Psi Corps.

29:16.583 --> 29:18.792
They can't be any part
in this, otherwise..

29:21.292 --> 29:22.792
Captain..

29:22.875 --> 29:26.667
...this is the only way to end
this without further bloodshed.

29:26.750 --> 29:29.125
Those responsible for
the violence will surrender

29:29.208 --> 29:30.833
and the innocent will leave.

29:30.917 --> 29:33.000
The crisis will be over.

29:33.083 --> 29:35.417
And one way or another..

29:35.500 --> 29:37.125
...we will be gone.

29:37.208 --> 29:38.750
Byron, how do we know

29:38.833 --> 29:42.875
that everyone responsible
for the violence will surrender?

29:42.958 --> 29:45.083
How can we be sure
some of them won't escape?

29:45.167 --> 29:48.083
You'll have everything you need
to be sure they won't get away.

29:52.167 --> 29:54.042
Alright.

29:54.125 --> 29:56.667
I'll order my people
and the Psi Cops to clear out.

29:56.750 --> 29:59.500
I'll have a transport tube
waiting at the end of the hall.

29:59.583 --> 30:02.208
We'll program it to take your
people back to Brown Level.

30:02.292 --> 30:03.708
But nowhere else.

30:03.792 --> 30:06.500
There will be no interference
from Bester's people.

30:06.583 --> 30:09.250
And those not involved
with the violence

30:09.333 --> 30:10.500
will be allowed to leave.

30:10.583 --> 30:12.250
If you can prove
to our satisfaction

30:12.333 --> 30:14.750
that those responsible
for the violence

30:14.833 --> 30:16.792
will remain in custody.

30:17.542 --> 30:18.917
Thank you.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.208
You will hear from me
again in a few hours.

30:22.542 --> 30:23.917
[dramatic music]

30:32.208 --> 30:33.542
You promised them what?

30:33.625 --> 30:36.625
It's the best chance we've got
to end this peacefully.

30:36.708 --> 30:38.292
We get those responsible--

30:38.375 --> 30:40.000
And the rest get away.

30:40.083 --> 30:42.000
You don't have
the right to do that.

30:42.083 --> 30:43.958
You speak for the Alliance
on a political basis.

30:44.042 --> 30:45.333
You don't speak
for Earth policies.

30:45.417 --> 30:46.917
(Lochley)
'We do now.'

30:47.000 --> 30:49.542
The violence was directed
against station personnel.

30:49.625 --> 30:51.417
Because of that,
we asked Earthgov

30:51.500 --> 30:52.958
to transfer jurisdiction.

30:53.042 --> 30:55.375
They agreed, both as
a gesture of goodwill

30:55.458 --> 30:57.208
and to help
end this crisis.

30:57.292 --> 31:00.417
You'll get your pound
of flesh, one way or another.

31:00.500 --> 31:02.792
Byron will be surrendering
with the rest.

31:02.875 --> 31:05.583
To you, not to us.

31:05.667 --> 31:08.333
I want him in our custody.

31:08.417 --> 31:10.875
Then you're going to have to go
through channels back home.

31:10.958 --> 31:13.000
Sorry. That's the way
it has to be.

31:17.125 --> 31:18.208
We'll see.

31:20.167 --> 31:21.875
Zack.

31:21.958 --> 31:24.667
Byron gave this to one
of my guys to give to you.

31:24.750 --> 31:26.125
'These are the Identicards
of those'

31:26.208 --> 31:28.167
responsible for the violence.

31:28.250 --> 31:30.167
They can't get off
the station without them.

31:30.250 --> 31:31.708
And these are
the signed confessions

31:31.792 --> 31:33.208
of everyone involved.

31:42.208 --> 31:44.042
This is over.

31:44.125 --> 31:45.292
Now, if you've got
a problem with that

31:45.375 --> 31:47.292
take it up with Earthgov.

31:47.375 --> 31:49.000
We don't have time.

31:49.083 --> 31:51.125
[dramatic music]

32:19.083 --> 32:21.167
[music continues]

33:01.208 --> 33:02.750
(Bester)
Byron.

33:09.208 --> 33:10.458
Byron.

33:19.292 --> 33:20.458
Byron.

33:23.292 --> 33:27.208
Byron. Byron.

33:27.292 --> 33:28.583
You hear me, don't you?

33:28.667 --> 33:29.833
Yes.

33:34.750 --> 33:36.833
Don't do this, Byron.

33:36.917 --> 33:39.083
We worked together once.

33:39.167 --> 33:43.708
We were close,
if not necessarily friends.

33:43.792 --> 33:45.833
We've had our problems.

33:45.917 --> 33:49.125
But it's still you
and it's still me.

33:50.042 --> 33:51.792
And we're still what we are.

33:53.583 --> 33:55.958
We both acted hastily.

33:56.042 --> 33:58.583
We both acted badly.

33:58.667 --> 34:01.167
But I'm willing to put that
behind us if you are.

34:02.958 --> 34:06.417
Don't go off
with strangers, Byron.

34:06.500 --> 34:08.208
Don't talk to strangers.

34:08.292 --> 34:09.667
No, I imagine
you don't want them

34:09.750 --> 34:12.000
to know what you did.

34:12.083 --> 34:13.500
What we did.

34:13.583 --> 34:16.917
Don't want them to know
how easily we kill their kind.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.042
I'm not thrilled
about the idea, no.

34:20.125 --> 34:22.375
But that aside..

34:22.458 --> 34:25.167
...we're still family, Byron.

34:25.250 --> 34:27.792
The Corps is mother.

34:27.875 --> 34:31.083
The Corps is father.

34:31.167 --> 34:33.958
It can't be any other way.

34:34.042 --> 34:37.125
Yes, it can.
And it will be.

34:37.208 --> 34:39.042
- After today.
- 'Byron.'

34:42.042 --> 34:43.458
They're ready to go.

34:46.583 --> 34:49.958
Then we should go quickly,
while we still can.

35:01.750 --> 35:03.208
(Bester)
We don't have much time.

35:03.292 --> 35:05.000
Tell the others
to meet me in Brown seven.

35:05.083 --> 35:06.583
We're going in on my signal.

35:06.667 --> 35:08.167
We have a job to do
and we're gonna do it.

35:08.250 --> 35:09.458
Make sure they understand.

35:09.542 --> 35:11.375
We're not leaving here
without Byron.

35:11.458 --> 35:13.292
[dramatic music]

35:28.458 --> 35:31.083
I kept my word.
We're here.

35:31.167 --> 35:32.750
We will surrender peacefully.

35:32.833 --> 35:34.458
And we will keep ours.

35:34.542 --> 35:37.167
The rest of your people will be
allowed to leave safely.

35:37.250 --> 35:38.333
Thank you. L..

35:39.875 --> 35:42.250
Just a second.

35:42.333 --> 35:44.042
I contest this transfer.

35:44.125 --> 35:46.875
- What's he doing here?
- I don't know.

35:46.958 --> 35:48.458
What are you
trying to pull here, Bester?

35:48.542 --> 35:51.125
Captain, I have a right
to these prisoners.

35:51.208 --> 35:52.500
- It's alright.
- No.

35:52.583 --> 35:53.875
- No!
- It's alright.

35:53.958 --> 35:56.167
- I won't go back with them! No!
- No!

end like this.

36:30.708 --> 36:32.750
It still doesn't!

36:32.833 --> 36:36.250
Yes, it does.
We can't go back now.

36:36.333 --> 36:38.417
There's too much blood.

36:38.500 --> 36:40.917
We are no longer who we were.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.917
We are what we have become.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.625
What you made us!

36:55.542 --> 36:57.958
Byron, don't do this.

36:59.292 --> 37:01.458
You're a symbol
to these people.

37:01.542 --> 37:04.042
Yes. And so are you.

37:04.125 --> 37:05.208
Remember that.

37:07.833 --> 37:09.250
I said there would
come a time

37:09.333 --> 37:12.292
when you would
have to walk away.

37:12.375 --> 37:14.167
Walk away, Lyta.
Do it now.

37:14.250 --> 37:16.167
For me, for the others.

37:16.250 --> 37:18.917
They will need you now.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.833
- I can't.
- If you stay, they win.

37:22.917 --> 37:24.542
If you stay,
then our love was false

37:24.625 --> 37:26.583
and my life was in vain.

37:26.667 --> 37:29.042
It will be the end
of everything I've worked for.

37:30.958 --> 37:33.333
Byron..

37:33.417 --> 37:35.667
I love you, Byron.

37:37.083 --> 37:39.667
How can I leave you?

37:39.750 --> 37:42.167
I'm already gone.

37:42.250 --> 37:44.292
It's too late for me.

37:44.375 --> 37:46.667
But not for the others.

They are my life's worth..

37:50.000 --> 37:52.625
...and my redemption
for sins past.

37:52.708 --> 37:54.917
You cannot save my life..

37:56.125 --> 37:58.083
...but you can save my soul.

38:02.833 --> 38:04.917
I called you my willow.

The strength
that would survive me

38:08.833 --> 38:10.875
and shelter those
who follow.

38:12.417 --> 38:15.083
Now, I need you to be strong
for me one last time.

38:18.625 --> 38:19.750

40:21.292 --> 40:23.167
- Hey, Stephen. What's up?
- Hey.

40:23.250 --> 40:24.458
I'm looking for Garibaldi.

40:24.542 --> 40:25.958
Since he's never
far from trouble

40:26.042 --> 40:27.917
I figured he might
be around here.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.333
No, I haven't
seen him all day. Why?

40:31.417 --> 40:34.167
Well, it may be nothing,
but I had a chance to watch him

40:34.250 --> 40:35.333
while we were stuck
in Medlab.

40:35.417 --> 40:36.417
Now, he asked me something.

40:36.500 --> 40:38.667
Some kind of
neural block question.

40:38.750 --> 40:43.375
And he seemed down. He seemed
lost, almost powerless.

40:43.458 --> 40:44.708
I mean, I've seen him
in a lot of moods

40:44.792 --> 40:46.667
but never like that one.

40:46.750 --> 40:49.583
And I just wanted to find him,
see if he was okay.

40:49.667 --> 40:51.333
Hope he doesn't
do anything stupid.

40:51.417 --> 40:52.458
Oh..

40:53.625 --> 40:55.458
Yeah. Over here.

41:14.625 --> 41:17.333
Wait. Wait.
Just a minute.

41:22.458 --> 41:23.500
Before the end..

41:25.000 --> 41:27.917
...Byron sent me
his memories.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.250
Of contacts..

41:31.333 --> 41:33.417
...safe houses..

41:33.500 --> 41:34.750
...resources..

41:37.083 --> 41:38.333
...secrets.

41:41.125 --> 41:42.167
I've arranged
for each of you

41:42.250 --> 41:44.667
to be met and escorted
into safety.

41:48.917 --> 41:51.208
I'll give you that
information as you leave.

41:52.458 --> 41:54.500
And then, tomorrow..

41:55.667 --> 41:57.125
...we begin again.

42:01.500 --> 42:02.708
Remember Byron.

42:05.833 --> 42:07.083
Remember Byron.

42:08.875 --> 42:10.333
Remember Byron.

42:12.375 --> 42:13.542
Remember Byron.

42:14.917 --> 42:16.375
'Remember Byron.'

42:22.167 --> 42:23.833
Monitor on.

42:23.917 --> 42:25.708
(male announcer on TV)
'With the Mars Rockets
ahead by five games'

42:25.792 --> 42:27.542
'in the interplanetary
standings.'

42:27.625 --> 42:28.917
'Though it's too early to say'

42:29.000 --> 42:30.583
'anything's a done deal
for the World Series'

42:30.667 --> 42:32.833
'there doesn't seem to be
any team on the horizon'

42:32.917 --> 42:35.125
'who can threaten
their position.'

42:35.208 --> 42:37.750
'In other breaking news,
ISN has just learned'

42:37.833 --> 42:39.625
'that the main headquarters
for the Psi Corps'

42:39.708 --> 42:42.292
'was bombed early this
morning by unknown parties.'

42:42.375 --> 42:44.042
'The only clues
found at the scene'

42:44.125 --> 42:46.125
'were the words
"Remember Byron"'

42:46.208 --> 42:47.958
'painted on the side
of the building.'

42:48.042 --> 42:49.333
'More after this.'

43:22.250 --> 43:25.083
