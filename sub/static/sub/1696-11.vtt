00:05.607 --> 00:10.476
This is so cool! I can't believe how
many people e-mail Hannah Montana.

00:10.612 --> 00:13.342
"Dear Hannah, you rock.
Jill in Milwaukee. "

00:15.017 --> 00:19.215
"Dear Hannah, you're awesome!
Danny in Iowa City. "

00:19.288 --> 00:23.782
"Dear Hannah, get your bra off
the shower rod. Jackson in Malibu. "

00:27.196 --> 00:29.391
And I mean it!

00:29.498 --> 00:33.229
He touched it. Now I have to burn it.

00:33.302 --> 00:37.238
"Dear Hannah, I love, love, love that
scarf you wore at the video awards.

00:37.306 --> 00:42.141
"Where, where, where can I get one?
Jenny in Walla Walla, Washington. "

00:42.211 --> 00:46.170
Listen to this one. "Dear Hannah,
I have this massive crush

00:46.248 --> 00:47.977
"on a boy who doesn't know I exist. "

00:48.050 --> 00:50.348
- Typical.
- Yep.

00:50.419 --> 00:52.683
"His locker is three down from mine.
What should I do?

00:52.755 --> 00:57.089
"Your biggest fan, Becca from Malibu. "
Becca from Malibu?

00:57.159 --> 01:00.185
You don't think it could be
Becca Weller from homeroom?

01:06.535 --> 01:11.165
I'm thinking it's a good shot.
Let's see, three down from Becca...

01:17.880 --> 01:19.745
- Oliver?
- Oliver?

01:19.815 --> 01:23.342
I can't believe it,
Becca Weller is crushing on Oliver.

01:25.053 --> 01:29.456
"Dear Becca,
if he won't ask you out, you ask him.

01:29.525 --> 01:34.588
"Rock his world!
Sincerely, Hannah Montana. "

01:34.663 --> 01:37.791
Making the world
a better place for love.

01:38.801 --> 01:43.431
Hey, Miles. My robe fell in the toilet so
I borrowed yours. Hope you don't mind.

01:43.505 --> 01:46.167
Great, now I have to burn that, too.

01:52.848 --> 01:54.543
<i> Come on!</i>

01:54.616 --> 01:56.345

02:01.990 --> 02:05.926

02:05.994 --> 02:10.657

<i>Who would have thought</i>

<i>Would double as a superstar?</i>

02:48.604 --> 02:50.401
Did you see that?
She just totally checked him out.

02:50.505 --> 02:51.836
Definitely interested.

02:58.914 --> 03:02.645
- Perfume walk-by.
- First you see her, then you smell her!

03:03.552 --> 03:06.112
Kinda like my Uncle Earl.

03:14.863 --> 03:16.956
Oliver? Hi.

03:17.032 --> 03:19.557
Did you get the History assignment?
I forgot to write it down.

03:19.635 --> 03:22.126
No, I don't have it, but Mr. Aaron,
he always writes it on the board.

03:22.204 --> 03:23.296
You can just go look at it.

03:23.372 --> 03:28.639
Oh. Okay. I'll go look. Thanks.

03:31.146 --> 03:32.238
Oh, Oliver?

03:32.314 --> 03:33.804
Excuse us. I'm sorry.

03:34.616 --> 03:37.312
- What's wrong with you?
- What'd I do?

03:37.786 --> 03:40.016
Couldn't you tell that
Becca Weller was hitting on you?

03:40.088 --> 03:41.487
What?

03:41.556 --> 03:42.750
Ow.

03:42.824 --> 03:45.918
A grilled cheese sandwich
would've picked that one up!

03:45.994 --> 03:47.985
They're serving grilled cheese today?

03:49.698 --> 03:52.258
Becca's an A student. She knows
what the History assignment is.

03:52.401 --> 03:56.963
Then why'd she ask me?
And don't hit me again.

03:57.973 --> 04:00.203
Because she's crushing on you.

04:00.776 --> 04:07.511
Listen to me, and I'm going to make
this real simple. She like you.

04:10.419 --> 04:11.750
How do you know?

04:14.790 --> 04:19.726
Remember when you had to spit-swear
never to reveal my other identity?

04:19.962 --> 04:23.830
Yes, and I got a cold right after that,
thank you very much.

04:24.366 --> 04:27.164
Well, start sucking down
some chicken soup, because...

04:28.303 --> 04:30.794
Another secret's coming your way.

04:32.441 --> 04:35.239
I wish we hadn't
outgrown the pinky swear.

04:36.211 --> 04:40.477
Becca e-mailed Hannah Montana and
said she had a massive crush on you.

04:40.649 --> 04:45.643
Becca Weller has a crush on me? Me?

04:46.321 --> 04:48.846
I know. We were shocked, too.

04:49.758 --> 04:55.390
So, Becca Weller wants
to take a ride on the Ollie Trolley.

04:57.199 --> 05:02.933
All right then, let's go
make her dreams come true.

05:03.905 --> 05:04.894
Ding.

05:06.308 --> 05:07.297
Ding.

05:08.443 --> 05:09.705
A- ding, a-ding, ding!

05:14.683 --> 05:16.207
- I forgot something.
- What?

05:16.284 --> 05:20.186
- My name!
- It rhymes with "trolley. "

05:21.857 --> 05:24.451
I need more than that!

05:24.559 --> 05:29.189
That boy doesn't have the brains the
good Lord gave a hunk of turkey jerky.

05:32.701 --> 05:33.929
I don't get it, man.

05:34.002 --> 05:35.799
What happened to
Oliver Smokin' Oken?

05:35.871 --> 05:38.101
Yeah, you're usually all, "Hey, babe,

05:38.173 --> 05:41.802
"are you from Tennessee?
Because you're the only 10 I see. "

05:43.879 --> 05:44.937
I got one.

05:45.013 --> 05:48.471
"Are you from Mississippi?
'Cause you're the only miss I sippy. "

05:50.919 --> 05:53.615
What? You got something better?

05:53.688 --> 05:56.987
I just totally froze.
Has this ever happened to you?

05:57.225 --> 06:00.251
- Has this ever happened to him?
- Excuse me.

06:00.495 --> 06:04.659
But I can be honest about my romantic
history. I don't have anything to hide.

06:04.733 --> 06:06.530
It's never happened to me.

06:08.270 --> 06:09.794
Gimme a water, Son.

06:09.871 --> 06:13.238
I swear there's nothing better than
a 10-mile run down the beach.

06:13.308 --> 06:16.004
One of these days
I'm gonna know what that feels like.

06:16.078 --> 06:18.444
Here you go, Dad. Feel free to tip.

06:18.513 --> 06:23.576
Here's one for ya. "Stop leaving your
underwear on the kitchen floor. "

06:23.652 --> 06:28.214
Hey, bud, Miley told me about
Ollie's Trolley's little derailment.

06:28.824 --> 06:32.521
Well, why don't we just
put it in the newspaper?

06:33.095 --> 06:35.325
Hey, it's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

06:35.664 --> 06:38.360
You wanna know how
I got my first date?

06:38.667 --> 06:42.194
I walked right up to her, I looked her
straight in the eyes and said,

06:42.270 --> 06:44.295
"My Robbie name is hi. "

06:46.575 --> 06:48.668
- And it worked?
- Like a charm.

06:49.044 --> 06:51.808
I mean, sometimes with women,
you just got to keep in mind

06:51.880 --> 06:55.008
it's not a matter of what you say,
but having the guts to say something.

06:55.550 --> 06:57.780
You just be yourself, partner.

06:59.488 --> 07:03.982
Well, if you all will excuse me, I think
I've jogged my way to a fudgy-buddy.

07:04.192 --> 07:06.092
Hey, ice cream man!

07:08.163 --> 07:11.929
I got another one.
"Are you from Waikiki?

07:12.000 --> 07:15.436
"'Cause I gotta ask, why, Kiki?"

07:16.571 --> 07:19.131
Oh, come on,
it works if her name is Kiki.

07:22.310 --> 07:26.474
- Hello, Jackson.
- Hello, Rico.

07:26.548 --> 07:30.279
- I want chicken wings.
- We don't have chicken wings.

07:30.352 --> 07:33.446
- Well, we should.
- Well, we don't.

07:33.522 --> 07:36.491
Come on, Rico, why do you
always have to be so mean?

07:36.558 --> 07:38.924
Hey, everybody has to have a hobby.

07:38.994 --> 07:42.020
I used to collect stamps,
but this is more fun!

07:44.432 --> 07:47.094
Anyways, back to chicken wings.

07:47.169 --> 07:49.296
Whose name is on that sign?

07:50.672 --> 07:53.607
- Yours.
- That's one.

07:53.708 --> 07:57.075
And whose father owns this place?

07:57.145 --> 07:59.113
- Yours.
- That's two.

08:00.582 --> 08:05.246
And whose father told you to "keep
Rico happy"? Does this look happy?

08:07.722 --> 08:10.555
That's three. And we have a winner!

08:11.793 --> 08:16.287
All right, Rico, what kind of wings
you want? Mild, medium or spicy?

08:16.364 --> 08:19.197
I'd say medium,
but then I couldn't say spicy!

08:23.905 --> 08:26.635
Just one more tweak
and it's Becca time.

08:26.708 --> 08:29.176
There, just messy enough to say,

08:29.244 --> 08:32.645
"I'm wild, but I can be tamed. "

08:34.582 --> 08:36.015
Breath check.

08:41.423 --> 08:45.587
- That's perfume!
- Oops! Sorry.

08:45.660 --> 08:48.390
- But it worked.
- This is it.

08:48.463 --> 08:49.487
It's all up to you now.

08:49.564 --> 08:51.429
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready!

08:51.499 --> 08:53.126
- Do you feel it?
- I feel it!

08:53.201 --> 08:55.465
- Are you the man?
- I'm the man!

08:59.541 --> 09:01.270
Go, go, go!

09:07.082 --> 09:09.277
Hi, Oliver.

09:13.855 --> 09:15.618
My Robbie name is hi.

09:22.030 --> 09:24.692
My Oliver name is hi.

09:25.066 --> 09:28.558
- Are you trying to ask me out?
- Yes. Wow.

09:28.637 --> 09:31.800
For a second there
I thought I was a babbling fool.

09:31.873 --> 09:34.740
- Oh, baby!
- Yes!

09:36.711 --> 09:40.238
What, a girl can't get excited
about Brussels sprouts?

09:40.315 --> 09:42.681
What is the matter with you people?

09:52.794 --> 09:55.024
- Are you done?
- Almost.

09:58.967 --> 10:00.025
Now I am.

10:00.101 --> 10:03.696
Keep your pants clean.
I'm gonna eat some ribs later.

10:03.772 --> 10:05.637
Sad, sad, sad.

10:05.707 --> 10:08.141
My best friend has been reduced
to a moist towelette.

10:08.910 --> 10:13.108
These are perfect.
Crunchy, spicy and

10:14.249 --> 10:15.238
Slippery.

10:15.550 --> 10:18.644
Hot sauce in my eye.
Hot sauce in my eye.

10:20.755 --> 10:24.691
Soda in my eye! Soda in my eye!

10:25.327 --> 10:30.128
There's nothing like dinner and a show.
I told Dad this wing thing would work.

10:30.732 --> 10:33.257
I can't wait to tell him my next idea.

10:33.335 --> 10:36.930
Oh, man, it doesn't involve him
in a chicken suit, does it?

10:43.011 --> 10:45.411
It does now!

10:49.851 --> 10:53.082
<i> Everybody dance,</i>
<i>everybody sing</i>

10:53.621 --> 10:56.351
<i>Everybody try a chicken wing</i>

10:56.424 --> 11:00.656
- Free chicken wing!
Hey! Back off!

11:00.762 --> 11:02.593
Watch the nuggets!

11:09.104 --> 11:10.935
Lying down on the job.

11:11.005 --> 11:13.997
Dad's not gonna be happy about this.

11:24.252 --> 11:27.016
Oliver, how did your date go
with Becca?

11:27.088 --> 11:28.817
Yeah, come on! Flap those lips!

11:29.023 --> 11:31.116
Sorry, I don't kiss and tell.

11:31.192 --> 11:32.989
- You kissed?
- Tell!

11:33.128 --> 11:37.462
My lips are sealed.

11:39.367 --> 11:41.426
She thinks I'm funny,
smart and sensitive!

11:41.669 --> 11:44.229
It was the greatest afternoon of my life!

11:47.842 --> 11:49.400
Zipped tight.

11:51.646 --> 11:53.409
This is wicked awesome.

11:53.481 --> 11:58.214
Once again, Hannah Montana has
made the world a better place for love.

11:59.454 --> 12:02.685
Becca must be so jazzed.
I wonder if she's thanked Hannah yet.

12:02.757 --> 12:05.590
- Check your e-mail.
- I am way ahead of you.

12:05.660 --> 12:08.390
"Dear Hannah,
thanks for the awesome advice.

12:08.463 --> 12:11.455
"Too bad I have to end things
with this guy who really likes me. "

12:11.599 --> 12:12.588
What?

12:13.468 --> 12:17.302
"He's a super nice guy but I just have
to tell him I just want to be friends. "

12:18.106 --> 12:20.074
She's going to dump Oliver!

12:20.141 --> 12:21.608
After just one day?

12:21.676 --> 12:25.806
Well, think on the bright side, it is
the longest relationship he's ever had.

12:32.887 --> 12:35.412
I don't understand.
Becca was so into Oliver.

12:35.957 --> 12:39.154
He thought things went great. Why
would she want to break up with him?

12:42.597 --> 12:46.158
- I think I know.
- The little tramp.

12:46.668 --> 12:48.636
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey!

12:49.170 --> 12:52.503
- Oliver!
- Oliver! You don't want to go in there.

12:52.574 --> 12:55.134
Big casserole explosion. Horrible.

12:55.210 --> 12:57.906
- Tuna everywhere.
- What are you doing?

12:58.480 --> 13:00.448
- You need to dump Becca.
- What?

13:00.949 --> 13:04.248
Did you miss everything
I said to my locker?

13:04.319 --> 13:07.186
Trust us. She's bad news.

13:07.255 --> 13:08.313
Real bad news.

13:08.389 --> 13:13.190
Like walking barefoot through a field
of cows after their morning sit down.

13:14.229 --> 13:16.094
What?
Y'all never heard that one before?

13:17.499 --> 13:18.966
Oh, I get it.

13:19.400 --> 13:23.131
You guys are afraid
I'll be too busy with Becca.

13:23.204 --> 13:24.728
Come here!

13:24.806 --> 13:28.867
I'll always have time
for my two little girls.

13:29.577 --> 13:35.243
- But not right now. Gotta go.
- Oliver, she e-mailed Hannah.

13:35.850 --> 13:39.479
She said she just wants
to be friends with you. I'm sorry.

13:40.622 --> 13:41.714
It's true.

13:41.789 --> 13:44.019
She's already got someone else.

13:46.227 --> 13:47.785
Oh, man!

13:50.965 --> 13:52.330
I don't understand.

13:52.400 --> 13:55.130
We're supposed to go
to the beach this afternoon.

13:56.371 --> 13:58.965
Man, she's going to dump me
at the beach.

13:59.040 --> 14:00.940
No, you don't know that.

14:01.376 --> 14:05.107
She could dump you on the bus,
in between classes, in the mall.

14:05.179 --> 14:08.273
- She could even text message you.
- That's what I'd do.

14:12.754 --> 14:15.587
Why did you tell me
she liked me in the first place?

14:15.657 --> 14:19.286
This is all your fault, you
and Hannah's stupid e-mail advice!

14:19.360 --> 14:22.454
Why don't you stick to singing
and your little dance moves?

14:22.664 --> 14:23.653
But...

14:26.401 --> 14:32.271
- He's right. I feel horrible.
- Don't. You dance way better than that.

14:37.679 --> 14:41.410
Hey, Mile, you're just in time. I'm
working on a new melody for Hannah.

14:41.482 --> 14:43.211
Sit down and tell me what you think.

14:43.284 --> 14:45.411
<i> The other side,</i>
<i>the other side</i>

14:45.486 --> 14:47.852
<i>The other side, you'll see</i>

14:47.922 --> 14:51.858
<i>The other side, the other side</i>
<i>The other side of me</i>

14:57.999 --> 15:03.335
Well, Jackson said he liked it.
Then again, he is a little kiss-up.

15:04.372 --> 15:06.237
Dad, it's not the song.

15:06.307 --> 15:10.368
It's just that I used the Hannah
advice column to help Oliver get a girl

15:10.445 --> 15:12.436
and ended up making things worse.

15:12.513 --> 15:13.741
Then I guess it's all your fault.

15:13.815 --> 15:15.840
Whoa, you're not supposed to say that.

15:15.917 --> 15:17.680
You're supposed to say
I did it with good intentions

15:17.752 --> 15:19.310
and shouldn't be so hard on myself.

15:19.387 --> 15:22.322
Okay, then you shouldn't be
so hard on yourself.

15:22.390 --> 15:25.154
How can you say that? It doesn't matter
what my intentions were.

15:25.226 --> 15:27.251
I meddled, and now Oliver's miserable.

15:27.662 --> 15:30.392
You cannot just let me
off the hook for that.

15:30.465 --> 15:34.367
- Okay, you're grounded.
- No!

15:34.535 --> 15:36.264
This is where you're supposed
to hug me

15:36.337 --> 15:39.329
and say,
"Everything's gonna be all right, bud. "

15:39.407 --> 15:42.706
- Do I have to draw you a map?
- It sure would help.

15:42.777 --> 15:46.713
Mile, you tried something,
it didn't work out.

15:46.781 --> 15:48.681
Sometimes that's just how life is.

15:48.750 --> 15:52.550
It's like telling your brother to put on a
new roll when the toilet paper runs out.

15:52.620 --> 15:54.144
Sometimes he does it,

15:54.222 --> 15:57.191
sometimes I'm left sitting there
reading shampoo bottles

15:57.258 --> 15:59.658
till someone comes home.

15:59.727 --> 16:02.218
That don't mean I was wrong for trying.

16:02.296 --> 16:06.460
- Everything's gonna be all right, bud.
- Too little, too late, Dad.

16:07.935 --> 16:09.926
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:10.004 --> 16:12.063
- Have you seen Oliver?
- Oh, yeah.

16:12.140 --> 16:14.267
- Does he still hate me?
- Oh, no.

16:14.342 --> 16:15.604
He's way past that.

16:15.677 --> 16:19.875
I hate my life,
I hate my life, I hate my life.

16:19.947 --> 16:22.541
Enough, already! Have some pride.

16:22.617 --> 16:24.847
I keep telling you
dump her before she dumps you.

16:24.919 --> 16:26.284
Lilly's right.

16:26.354 --> 16:28.914
The important thing is
you're still Smokin' Oken.

16:28.990 --> 16:30.582
<i> You leave</i>
<i>the ladies heartbroken</i>

16:30.658 --> 16:33.024
<i>And everybody knows</i>
<i>that we're not just joking</i>

16:33.094 --> 16:38.422
- <i>A wicky, wicky, why</i>
- <i>And a wicky, wicky, bye</i>

16:38.499 --> 16:42.128
You guys are right!
When it rhymes, it makes sense.

16:44.138 --> 16:46.629
<i> You made my life</i>
<i>a wreck-a so I'm dumping you, Becca</i>

16:46.808 --> 16:49.675
- <i>You made my life a wreck-a</i>
- <i>So he's dumping you, Becca</i>

16:49.744 --> 16:51.905
<i>A wicky, wicky, why</i>
<i>A wicky, wicky, wicky</i>

16:51.979 --> 16:54.812
What the heck are you wearing?

16:55.950 --> 16:59.078
Don't drain the tub. I'm making soup.

17:02.690 --> 17:03.816
What are you doing?

17:03.891 --> 17:06.257
I'm giving that Becca
a piece of Hannah Montana's mind.

17:06.327 --> 17:09.523
No, you're not. Hannah Montana's
done enough trouble for one day.

17:09.696 --> 17:12.461
Oh, look. How convenient.
She wrote you again.

17:12.532 --> 17:15.900
Lilly, I mean it.
I'm not doing this anymore.

17:18.940 --> 17:19.964
Uh-oh.

17:20.040 --> 17:23.704
- What?
- "Dear Hannah, you were right.

17:23.778 --> 17:27.578
- "Oliver is such a great guy for me. "
- "So today in the cafeteria,

17:27.647 --> 17:30.014
"I broke up with
my old boyfriend Toby. "

17:30.084 --> 17:31.073
Toby?

17:31.152 --> 17:32.551
That's the guy
she was holding hands with.

17:33.721 --> 17:36.554
"He took it pretty hard.
But now Oliver and I can be together. "

17:36.624 --> 17:38.854
Not if he breaks up with her!
We have to stop him!

17:38.926 --> 17:41.156
What are we standing here for?
Let's go!

17:42.096 --> 17:43.893
I thought you weren't
going to butt in anymore.

17:43.965 --> 17:45.432
That was before we told him
to break up

17:45.500 --> 17:47.491
with the first girl to like him
since preschool.

17:47.568 --> 17:50.298
Hey, I didn't "like him" like him.

17:51.973 --> 17:55.500
I only held his hand
because I wanted his crayons.

17:55.576 --> 17:59.376
He had the 64 pack,
with the sharpener!

18:04.318 --> 18:07.981
I'm not hanging from a parasail
and flying across this beach.

18:08.055 --> 18:09.283
Oh, yes, you are.

18:09.357 --> 18:12.588
It's advertising,
and my dad already paid for it.

18:12.660 --> 18:13.684
I don't care.

18:13.761 --> 18:17.754
- I refuse to look ridiculous.
- Said the man in the chicken suit.

18:18.666 --> 18:20.463
Jackson, have you seen Oliver?

18:20.535 --> 18:22.765
Yeah, he's down on the beach
with some girl.

18:22.837 --> 18:26.102
'Cause he can get a girl,
because he's not in a chicken suit!

18:26.174 --> 18:30.338
All I'm looking for is "down the
beach. " But thanks for sharing.

18:31.646 --> 18:34.171
- We'll never get to him in time.
- I have to!

18:34.248 --> 18:36.842
I'm the one that messed this up.
If I don't stop him,

18:36.918 --> 18:40.251
- then I'm never gonna forgive myself.
- But how? Look how far away he is.

18:40.321 --> 18:42.050
You'd have to be able to fly!

18:47.195 --> 18:48.628
Is that a parasail?

18:48.696 --> 18:52.496
Slow down there, toots. There's only
one way you get to go up in this thing.

18:54.335 --> 18:58.203
You are one evil little boy.

18:58.472 --> 19:01.964
It's a little too late for flattery. Hit it!

19:08.783 --> 19:10.512
Hey, this isn't bad!

19:13.855 --> 19:15.755
Oh, yeah, I like this.

19:17.391 --> 19:21.623
Oliver! Oliver!

19:22.330 --> 19:25.299
Boat driver, I need to be lower!

19:27.401 --> 19:28.390
Lower!

19:31.472 --> 19:32.939
Lower!

19:35.776 --> 19:37.209
Thank you.

19:39.113 --> 19:40.876
Becca, I...

19:40.948 --> 19:43.883
Oliver! Don't do it! Don't say anything!

19:45.453 --> 19:46.613
Miley?

19:47.788 --> 19:49.221
Please say I'm not too late.

19:49.290 --> 19:51.315
Miley, why are you dressed
like a chicken?

19:51.392 --> 19:55.590
Because they're all out of gorilla
suits. Now, can we move on?

19:55.897 --> 20:00.300
Me and Oliver need to have a little talk,
you know, face to beak.

20:00.368 --> 20:02.836
Please say you didn't break up
with her.

20:03.404 --> 20:04.462
What?

20:04.538 --> 20:08.338
Excuse me, can't a chicken
get a little privacy here?

20:08.709 --> 20:10.836
You were going to break up with me?

20:10.912 --> 20:13.039
Well, you were going
to break up with me.

20:13.114 --> 20:15.207
No, I wasn't. Why would you think that?

20:15.283 --> 20:18.218
Because that's what
you wrote Hannah Montana!

20:19.921 --> 20:22.754
- How did you know that?
- How did I know that?

20:23.591 --> 20:26.583
How did I know that?
How did I know that?

20:28.829 --> 20:32.856
Because you read minds.

20:33.834 --> 20:36.997
Seriously, I don't read minds,
that's ridiculous.

20:37.071 --> 20:41.940
I read your PDA,
which I stole from your gym locker.

20:42.877 --> 20:48.076
- Why would you do that?
- Because I'm a bad chicken.

20:49.684 --> 20:53.381
And because she's in love with me.

20:54.088 --> 20:56.056
- What?
- Yes.

20:56.123 --> 20:58.182
You don't have to hide it anymore.

20:58.259 --> 21:00.159
Face it, you were nearly driven mad

21:00.227 --> 21:02.821
by the thought of me
in the arms of another woman!

21:03.764 --> 21:05.095
Okay.

21:05.733 --> 21:08.497
What he said, but with less feeling.

21:08.569 --> 21:10.503
She's been in love with me for years.

21:10.905 --> 21:14.102
- A deep, needy...
- Okay, she gets it.

21:14.408 --> 21:17.844
The good thing is that
nobody was breaking up with anybody.

21:17.912 --> 21:20.380
Oliver's a really special guy.

21:20.481 --> 21:22.881
You two were meant for each other.

21:26.520 --> 21:30.547
Well, all that's left to say is,
bock, bock, bye-bye!

21:37.732 --> 21:40.132
All out of eggs, sorry.

21:59.887 --> 22:03.516
Jackson! Jackson!

22:04.892 --> 22:09.989
Is that you? Jackson!

22:12.166 --> 22:16.193
- Yeah, Dad?
- Jackson! Guess where I am.

22:17.405 --> 22:18.394
Oh, no!

22:22.009 --> 22:25.206
Sorry, Dad, that's my bad, buddy.
