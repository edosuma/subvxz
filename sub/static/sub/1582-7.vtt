some exciting news.

01:48.979 --> 01:50.313
(kids murmuring)

01:50.347 --> 01:53.215
I'm here to tell you about
a field trip so amazing,

01:53.250 --> 01:55.484
we've put "sign here" stickers
on the permission slips.

01:55.519 --> 01:58.954
As you recall, these stickers
came from last year's field trip

01:58.989 --> 02:00.656
to the "sign here"
sticker factory.

02:00.691 --> 02:02.792
But thanks
to my old navy buddy--

02:02.826 --> 02:06.028
we both love to shop
at Old Navy--

02:06.063 --> 02:09.031
the students of this school
will be taking a ride

02:09.066 --> 02:10.699
on a nuclear-powered,
attack-class submarine,

02:24.948 --> 02:25.915
So you're all excited, eh?

02:25.949 --> 02:27.350
ALL:
Yay!

02:27.384 --> 02:28.651
Well, that's too bad,

02:28.685 --> 02:30.353
because many of you
will not be going.

02:30.387 --> 02:31.387
ALL:
Huh?!

02:31.421 --> 02:32.822
There's limited room

02:32.856 --> 02:35.057
on the submarine, so only
the best-behaved students--

02:35.092 --> 02:37.226
as determined by me--

02:37.260 --> 02:38.894
will go on the trip.

02:42.399 --> 02:43.766
Whoo-hoo!
Well, I get to go!

02:43.800 --> 02:45.234
To increase the tension,

02:45.268 --> 02:46.869
everyone starts
with a clean slate.

02:46.903 --> 02:49.271
But from this moment on...

02:49.306 --> 02:51.273
I am the law.

02:51.308 --> 02:53.008
I hold the red pen.

Sweetie, about the submarine...

03:31.915 --> 03:34.283
what's your favorite food to eat
when you're disappointed?

03:34.317 --> 03:35.918
I'm going shopping tomorrow.

03:35.952 --> 03:38.487
Ice cream sandwiches. Why?

03:38.522 --> 03:40.423
What your mother
is trying to say

03:40.457 --> 03:42.825
is we don't think
you can be good that long.

03:42.859 --> 03:44.960
Mom, is that true?

03:44.995 --> 03:48.264
Well, that's sort of what
I was trying to say, but...

03:48.298 --> 03:50.633
What your mother
is trying to say is...

03:50.667 --> 03:53.102
No, you're wrong!
You're all wrong!

03:53.136 --> 03:54.470
I didn't say anything.

03:54.504 --> 03:56.806
Were you thinking it?
Yes.

03:56.840 --> 03:58.574
Get real, ding-dong!

03:58.608 --> 04:00.342
You've already done
so much bad stuff,

04:00.377 --> 04:02.578
Skinner's never gonna
let you on that boat.

04:02.612 --> 04:04.280
No, Skinner said
I had a clean slate,

04:04.314 --> 04:06.449
so right now, I'm as good
as any other kid.

04:06.483 --> 04:08.484
(Homer and Lisa laughing)

04:10.554 --> 04:12.121
Good one, ding-dong.

04:12.155 --> 04:13.823
Mom!

04:13.857 --> 04:15.991
Don't listen to them.
They're the ding-dongs.

04:16.026 --> 04:17.091
Wha...?!

04:17.127 --> 04:19.562
Bart, sweetie, this
is an opportunity

04:19.596 --> 04:22.031
for you to turn things
around yet again.

04:22.065 --> 04:24.133
And I believe in you.

04:24.167 --> 04:25.668
Yet again.

04:25.702 --> 04:27.369
Thanks, Mom.

04:27.404 --> 04:29.472
I'll start by taking my plate
to the dishwasher.

04:29.506 --> 04:30.806
Wherever that is.

04:30.841 --> 04:33.008
(cupboards open, shut,
dish breaks)

04:33.043 --> 04:34.276
Pfft. Marge,

04:34.311 --> 04:36.178
I love Bart
as much as you do,

04:36.213 --> 04:37.546
but actually not.

04:37.581 --> 04:39.215
And that kid
cannot go one week

04:39.249 --> 04:40.516
without getting
in trouble.

04:40.550 --> 04:43.552
Now, if you'd be so kind
as to start my car for me,

04:43.587 --> 04:44.787
I'm going to Moe's.

04:44.821 --> 04:46.322
(blowing air)

04:48.058 --> 04:49.692
Ooh.

04:49.726 --> 04:51.026

04:51.061 --> 04:52.628
Thank you.

04:52.662 --> 04:53.996

04:56.266 --> 04:58.534
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm!

04:58.568 --> 05:00.169
What are you doing?

05:00.203 --> 05:01.604
To avoid temptation,
I'm getting rid

05:01.638 --> 05:04.106
of all the things that could get
me in trouble at school.

05:04.140 --> 05:06.475
I buried all my whoopee cushions
in the backyard.

05:09.212 --> 05:11.213
(flatulence sounds)
Hmm?

05:13.083 --> 05:14.950
(groans) What the...?

05:14.985 --> 05:16.418
That's not where
I buried them.

05:16.453 --> 05:17.720
Come on!

05:19.089 --> 05:21.223
Don't take my custom limo!

05:21.258 --> 05:24.593
At least let me sniff my coke
out of the floor mats!

05:24.628 --> 05:25.694

05:28.298 --> 05:29.865
Oh, hi, little girl.

05:29.900 --> 05:32.735
What brings you to see
Uncle Krusty? (chuckles)

05:32.769 --> 05:34.537
Krusty, are you broke?

05:34.571 --> 05:35.771
Yeah. All it takes

05:35.805 --> 05:37.606
is some bad luck
at the ponies,

05:37.641 --> 05:39.375
worse luck in
the Bitcoin market,

05:39.409 --> 05:42.411
heavy investment in a
high-end bookmark company.

05:42.445 --> 05:44.914
You could do what
<i>Everybody Loves Raymond</i> did.

05:44.948 --> 05:46.882
Go off the air
while I'm still good?

05:46.917 --> 05:49.718
That horse has left the stable,
gone to the glue factory

05:49.753 --> 05:52.621
and has been used
to make art projects.

05:52.656 --> 05:55.624
I mean, you could sell
foreign rights to your show.

05:55.659 --> 05:56.959
Even <i>SpongeBob</i> did it.

05:58.662 --> 06:01.463

broke, girlie.

06:20.450 --> 06:21.917
Not my Monet!

06:21.952 --> 06:23.485
I only looked
at it once!

06:23.520 --> 06:25.020
What I'm saying is,

06:25.055 --> 06:27.990
you could produce
foreign versions of your TV show

06:28.024 --> 06:29.625
with actors
from other countries.

06:29.659 --> 06:31.527
Okay, I'll do it!

06:31.561 --> 06:34.129
Not my Shetland dolphin!

06:34.164 --> 06:36.298
Although I won't miss
the constant yapping.

06:36.333 --> 06:38.033

06:38.068 --> 06:40.569
Not anymore, he ain't.

there's no water pressure.

07:13.236 --> 07:16.472
Excuses are like handkerchiefs;
everybody's got one.

07:16.506 --> 07:18.007
I don't have
a handkerchief.

Off the list!

07:19.209 --> 07:20.909
Firm but fair, sir.

07:20.944 --> 07:23.679
Don't want any troublemakers
on our submarine.

07:23.713 --> 07:26.015
Not bad, Simpson.
Did you wash your knees?

07:26.049 --> 07:27.349
Front <i>and</i> back, sir.

07:28.918 --> 07:31.420
You're like egg salad
at a picnic, Simpson.

07:31.454 --> 07:34.923
Even when you look good,
we know you're going bad.

07:34.958 --> 07:36.191
Principal Skinner?

07:36.226 --> 07:38.594
I object to this
arbitrary use of power

07:38.628 --> 07:40.696
and request
I be taken off the list.

07:40.730 --> 07:41.897
Off the list!

07:41.931 --> 07:43.098
Thank you.

What? No.
I'll be late.

a ten-year-old's spirit.

08:49.933 --> 08:51.333
Time to celebrate

with a fruit-
on-the-bottom yogurt.

08:56.339 --> 08:58.273
Mmm! Fruit!

No, Mother, I did not use
any of your talc.

09:09.205 --> 09:11.440
I don't know why
the bottle feels lighter.

09:11.474 --> 09:13.475
Maybe you're just getting
stronger!

09:13.510 --> 09:16.445
Some days I could just kill you.

09:16.479 --> 09:18.180

09:18.214 --> 09:19.448
She heard me.

09:27.190 --> 09:29.058
That's offensive.

which you can be if you want.

10:23.313 --> 10:24.380
I don't care.

10:24.414 --> 10:26.382
Just do the Krusty show
in your country

10:26.416 --> 10:28.183
and send me ten percent.

10:28.218 --> 10:30.252
Then send me another 60%.

10:30.286 --> 10:32.921
Then five percent more,
and you're good.

10:38.395 --> 10:39.495
Nice job, Simpson.

10:39.529 --> 10:41.130
You even got
my Suze Orman tape

10:41.164 --> 10:42.631
unstuck from
the cassette player.

10:42.665 --> 10:45.534
She's the reason I was able
to purchase a new watch band.

10:45.568 --> 10:48.303
Always bragging about
his watch band.

10:49.372 --> 10:51.039
If only I could tell time.

10:51.074 --> 10:53.375
Okay, I washed
your car like you asked,

10:53.410 --> 10:55.411
I did your paper rte,
and I'm sorry.

10:55.445 --> 10:56.745
I really am.

10:56.780 --> 10:58.580
This could be the
turning point of my life.

10:58.615 --> 11:00.616
Where you, as a school guy,
made a difference.

11:00.650 --> 11:01.884
What do you think?

11:01.918 --> 11:03.519
Can I go on that sub?

11:05.655 --> 11:06.889
Sorry, Simpson.

11:06.923 --> 11:09.057
Take her down.

11:09.092 --> 11:10.759
KIDS:
Yay!

11:16.132 --> 11:17.499
RALPH:
<i>Yay!</i>

11:17.534 --> 11:19.001
NELSON:

MILHOUSE:

11:28.511 --> 11:29.478

11:29.512 --> 11:31.146

11:31.181 --> 11:32.414
"Wanti wanti can't get it,

11:32.449 --> 11:34.283
getti getti no want it."

11:34.317 --> 11:37.252
Now here's Itchem

12:13.389 --> 12:15.057
You're a hit all
over the world.

12:15.091 --> 12:18.026
There's Chinese Krusty
with Sideshow Mao.

12:18.061 --> 12:19.895
Even Irish Krusty.

12:19.929 --> 12:21.630
Me ma, she had 12 children,

12:21.664 --> 12:23.065
but only three lived.

12:23.099 --> 12:24.700
Then they closed the mill.

12:24.734 --> 12:25.968
(chuckles sadly)

12:26.002 --> 12:27.402
Hey-hey.

12:27.437 --> 12:29.838

12:32.609 --> 12:34.977
And it's all thanks

12:35.011 --> 12:36.345
To show my
appreciation,

12:36.379 --> 12:37.713
I'm gonna bring
you with me

12:37.747 --> 12:39.515
next time I entertain
the troops.

12:39.549 --> 12:42.217
Warning: they're
not American troops.

12:47.957 --> 12:49.424
(slurps)

12:50.894 --> 12:52.094
Hello, boy.

12:52.128 --> 12:53.362
At times like this,

12:53.396 --> 12:54.930
there's not much
you can say,

12:54.964 --> 12:56.765
especially if you don't
know what happened.

12:56.799 --> 12:58.033
(sobs)

12:58.067 --> 13:00.102
Skinner didn't
let me go.

13:00.136 --> 13:01.770
Really?

13:01.804 --> 13:04.373
Hey, I bet that submarine
isn't so fun anyway.

13:04.407 --> 13:05.607
(sniffs)

13:05.642 --> 13:06.875
You think so?

13:06.910 --> 13:08.610
Fire that torpedo,
Milhouse.

13:08.645 --> 13:10.345
Aye, aye.

13:10.380 --> 13:11.880
Where'd it go?

13:11.915 --> 13:13.348
It was just
imaginary.

13:13.383 --> 13:14.583
I know a kid
should never

13:14.617 --> 13:15.951
turn to his father
for help,

13:15.985 --> 13:17.553
but I got screwed.

13:17.587 --> 13:19.221
Is there anything
you can do?

13:22.559 --> 13:23.759
As I always say,

13:23.793 --> 13:25.360
don't get mad;
get dinner.

13:25.395 --> 13:27.129
Then get even.

13:27.163 --> 13:29.131
With Skinner.

13:29.165 --> 13:31.366
You'll really
help me get revenge?

13:31.401 --> 13:32.601
Yes.

13:32.635 --> 13:34.369
What's Skinner's
weakness?

13:34.404 --> 13:35.604
Everything.

13:35.638 --> 13:36.872

14:21.656 --> 14:24.057
(imitates Mother): Seymour, I'm going out
for a walk.

14:24.092 --> 14:26.526
Uh-huh, see you in several
months at the soonest.

14:26.561 --> 14:28.562
(knocking continues)

14:33.701 --> 14:35.469
We have a problem,
Seymour.

14:35.503 --> 14:36.737
I did everything
for you

14:36.771 --> 14:38.972
and you stabbed
me in the back.

14:39.007 --> 14:42.109
Wait a minute, I knew you
were a neat freak, Skinner,

14:42.143 --> 14:44.444
but you beat your rug
till it bleeds?

14:45.446 --> 14:47.848
(gasps)

14:47.882 --> 14:49.750
All right,
I'll come clean.

14:49.784 --> 14:53.186
I woke up and, surprisingly,
Mother wasn't there beside me.

14:53.221 --> 14:55.522
She was dead.

14:56.924 --> 14:59.359
Still, I can't
be sure I killed her.

14:59.394 --> 15:01.862
Well, I'm sure
our town's police force

15:01.896 --> 15:04.298
will handle this
competently.

15:08.069 --> 15:10.037
Now, I could
investigate further,

15:10.071 --> 15:12.839
but you don't want to sit
in a jail all weekend.

15:12.874 --> 15:15.876
Chief, that was
awfully arbitrary.

15:15.910 --> 15:17.511
Not compared to this.

15:17.545 --> 15:20.213
(groans)

15:21.983 --> 15:23.150
Let me handle this.

15:23.184 --> 15:24.851
Just go upstairs
and shut the door.

15:24.886 --> 15:28.555
There are some things
only a boy should see.

15:28.589 --> 15:30.624
(door closes)

15:30.658 --> 15:33.827
(both laugh)

15:33.861 --> 15:35.329
(cackles)

15:39.334 --> 15:42.803
Now do you want to dispose
of this jelly-soaked pillow?

15:42.837 --> 15:45.272
Just call me The Cleaner.

15:46.708 --> 15:47.908
(slurps)

15:53.448 --> 15:55.082
Um, where's the body?

15:55.116 --> 15:56.616
She's in a better place.

15:57.685 --> 15:59.419
(chain saw rumbling)

16:00.855 --> 16:02.756
The deed is done.

16:02.790 --> 16:04.524
Oh, I wish you'd
asked me before you...

16:04.559 --> 16:06.493
Look, you kill them,
I get rid of them.

16:06.527 --> 16:07.761
That's always
been our deal.

16:07.795 --> 16:09.062
But I do have one question:

16:09.097 --> 16:10.364
Do you want the head?

16:10.398 --> 16:12.265
No, no, God, no.

16:12.300 --> 16:14.534
Well, if you change your mind,
it'll be in my freezer.

16:14.569 --> 16:15.802
But only for a week.

16:15.837 --> 16:17.537
Got a lot of ice cream
coming in.

16:17.572 --> 16:20.607
Ugh, if this were a movie,
Mother wouldn't let me watch it.

16:20.641 --> 16:23.210
Now, I'm afraid it's time
to start your new life.

16:23.244 --> 16:25.412
You'll be hunted,
on the run,

16:25.446 --> 16:27.614
searching for the man
who killed your mother,

16:27.648 --> 16:29.449
which is you.
So avoid mirrors.

16:30.852 --> 16:32.152
(Krusty humming)

16:33.755 --> 16:35.956
Krusty, I have
some very bad news.

16:35.990 --> 16:38.258
The foreign Krustys
are all hotter than you.

16:38.292 --> 16:41.128
Irish Krusty's
got a show on Broadway.

16:41.162 --> 16:42.896
Oi, where's your monkey?

16:42.930 --> 16:44.264
There never was a monkey.

16:44.298 --> 16:45.632
I was just tellin' stories

16:45.666 --> 16:47.300
to forget me consumption.

16:47.335 --> 16:48.402
(coughs)

16:48.436 --> 16:50.370
(applause)

16:50.405 --> 16:51.438
Well, you see there,

16:51.472 --> 16:53.173
they need to hit the
word "monkey" harder

16:53.207 --> 16:54.808
if they want
to get a laugh.

16:54.842 --> 16:56.877
Don't you get
what I'm trying to tell you?

16:56.911 --> 16:59.913
You are now the least popular
Krusty in the world.

16:59.947 --> 17:01.915
What about Romanian Krusty?

17:01.949 --> 17:04.050
What, you mean
President-for-Life Krusty?

17:04.085 --> 17:05.585
(low groan)

17:05.619 --> 17:07.554
I still get a
piece, right?

17:07.588 --> 17:09.455
Putz.
You're the least successful

17:09.490 --> 17:11.090
version of you there is.

17:11.125 --> 17:12.192
A piece.

17:12.226 --> 17:14.895
Now, let's see
where this goes.

17:14.929 --> 17:17.597
Irish Krusty, this
is your baby.

17:17.632 --> 17:20.934
The only thing working
round here is your libido.

17:20.968 --> 17:23.170
Now I know why Ma
walked into the sea

17:23.204 --> 17:26.173
with her pockets full
of rocks, on Christmas.

17:26.207 --> 17:29.609
Why doesn't this
material work for <i>me?</i>

17:29.644 --> 17:32.846
Seymour, the cops
are on their way.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.714
(siren wails)

17:37.151 --> 17:40.120
Here's a bus ticket
to Juarez and your fake I.D.

17:40.154 --> 17:41.521
SKINNER:
Oh, come on,

17:41.556 --> 17:42.923
I don't look anything like this

17:42.957 --> 17:43.957
"Dick Fiddler."

17:43.991 --> 17:45.892
No, you don't... yet.

17:47.995 --> 17:49.296
I don't want to
sound ungrateful,

17:49.330 --> 17:51.097
but could I eat
one of the potatoes?

17:51.132 --> 17:55.001
Sorry, but Dick Fiddler
is allergic to potatoes.

17:55.036 --> 17:56.303
I understand.

17:56.337 --> 17:58.872
(both giggling)

18:03.678 --> 18:04.878
Dad?

18:04.912 --> 18:06.613
Thanks for sticking up for me.

18:06.647 --> 18:08.281
(laughs)

18:08.316 --> 18:10.450
Someday I may have
to fake my own death.

18:10.485 --> 18:12.385
And maybe you can
help me with that.

18:12.420 --> 18:13.653
Sure, Dad.

18:13.688 --> 18:14.855
Someday soon.

18:14.889 --> 18:16.990
As in, what are you
doing this Friday?

18:18.526 --> 18:20.393
Aah! Dick Fiddler!

18:20.428 --> 18:22.796
Gentlemen, I can't
run away from what I've done.

18:22.830 --> 18:24.731
I accept that
I killed my mother.

18:24.765 --> 18:27.167
My whole life,
she's belittled me.

18:27.201 --> 18:29.803
Maybe deep down, I'm glad.

18:29.837 --> 18:31.471
This has gone
far enough.

18:31.506 --> 18:34.040
I'm starting to think
this "school project"

18:34.075 --> 18:35.842
is more than
meets the eye.

18:35.877 --> 18:37.744
Mother?
You're alive?

18:37.778 --> 18:40.480
Seymour, when this
fat guy and his kid

18:40.515 --> 18:42.682
asked me to fake my
death to punish you,

18:42.717 --> 18:45.685
I said, "Sure, that's
something to do."

18:45.720 --> 18:48.221
You know, when you
glare like that,

18:48.256 --> 18:50.156
you look really
beautiful.

18:50.191 --> 18:51.992
(grumbles):
Mm-hmm.

18:52.026 --> 18:53.693
But when I just
heard you say

18:53.728 --> 18:56.429
you were glad
to see me dead...

18:56.464 --> 18:59.399
I thought, "Now I'm gonna
be meaner to you than ever."

18:59.433 --> 19:01.001
How is that possible?

19:01.035 --> 19:04.004
I've stopped taking
those pills that keep me nice.
