02:47.868 --> 02:52.439
<b>I mean, it was, like,</b>

02:58.879 --> 03:01.114

<b>I see the wheels turning.</b>

03:01.181 --> 03:02.782

<b>She's careful about</b>
<b>every word she says</b>

03:04.217 --> 03:07.287
<b>because she has a reputation</b>

03:07.387 --> 03:08.555
<b>- I don't know.</b>

03:08.655 --> 03:10.056
<b>Did you even say what your</b>

<b>- Oh, why it's gotta be me?</b>
<b>I was happy it was on you.</b>

03:11.892 --> 03:13.827
<b>- You get $10,000, so you</b>
<b>have to say it first.</b>

03:14.861 --> 03:16.763
<b>- There's a lot of reasons,</b>

03:16.863 --> 03:19.833
<b>but, Thorgy, yes,</b>
<b>she did have a smaller role,</b>

03:19.933 --> 03:23.069
<b>but there was opportunity</b>
<b>for her, in my eyes,</b>

03:23.170 --> 03:24.971
<b>like mine, I had Mariah--</b>

03:25.071 --> 03:26.773
<b>- But--</b>
<b>- Let me finish.</b>

03:26.873 --> 03:30.210
<b>When I saw what I had, I put</b>
<b>my own elements in there.</b>

03:30.310 --> 03:32.078
<b>- Stevie is not current.</b>

03:32.112 --> 03:35.282
<b>It's difficult</b>
<b>to compare that to Mariah.</b>

03:35.382 --> 03:37.217
<b>- Oh, I'm not comparing her</b>
<b>to Mariah.</b>

03:37.317 --> 03:39.119
<b>- I feel there were no gags</b>

03:39.219 --> 03:43.456
<b>in the music part</b>
<b>of Stevie Nicks.</b>

03:43.557 --> 03:45.325
<b>- Oh, Miss Big and Milky,</b>

03:45.425 --> 03:47.460
<b>Season 3, Shangy would have</b>

03:51.097 --> 03:54.734
<b>I should be a more evolved,</b>

03:54.835 --> 03:55.902
<b>I just feel like</b>

03:56.002 --> 03:59.973
<b>I'm having to defend,</b>

04:01.942 --> 04:04.544
<b>Correct me if I'm wrong.</b>

<b>So tell me what choice</b>
<b>would you have made?</b>

04:08.748 --> 04:10.584
<b>- I think I would have</b>
<b>chosen Thorgy to stay.</b>

04:10.684 --> 04:14.387
<b>I find Thorgy's concepts</b>
<b>and her looks</b>

04:14.487 --> 04:16.122
<b>much more exciting.</b>

04:16.223 --> 04:18.291

<b>the best All Star win.</b>

08:26.106 --> 08:29.209
<b>[ cheers and applause ]</b>

08:29.309 --> 08:31.044
<b>- How do you feel</b>
<b>about improv?</b>

08:31.111 --> 08:34.648
<b>- I do not consider myself,</b>
<b>like, a comedian per se.</b>

08:34.748 --> 08:36.049
<b>I'm excited.</b>

08:36.149 --> 08:38.785
<b>In Season 1, we never had</b>
<b>the opportunity to do improv.</b>

08:38.885 --> 08:41.254
<b>The character I'm playing</b>
<b>is the virgin,</b>

08:41.354 --> 08:42.289
<b>and I was, like,</b>
<b>what about</b>

08:42.389 --> 08:44.958
<b>if this girl</b>
<b>is an African princess?</b>

08:45.058 --> 08:48.161
<b>Come on, now. You can</b>
<b>just make her really funny.</b>

08:48.261 --> 08:49.396
<b>I would like to approach</b>
<b>my character</b>

08:49.496 --> 08:53.233
<b>like somebody fresh</b>
<b>off the boat from Africa.</b>

08:53.333 --> 08:54.701
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- Because in our culture,</b>

08:54.801 --> 08:57.103
<b>it's like you have to be married</b>
<b>to be able to, you know--</b>

08:57.204 --> 08:59.105
<b>You have to be married</b>
<b>to be able to have...</b>

08:59.206 --> 09:00.941
<b>[ laughs ]</b>
<b>I mean, it's--</b>

09:01.074 --> 09:02.375
<b>I can't even spell out</b>
<b>the words</b>

09:02.475 --> 09:04.945
<b>because</b>
<b>it's like this girl--</b>

09:05.078 --> 09:07.681
<b>- But how would you establish</b>
<b>the idea specifically</b>

09:07.781 --> 09:10.217
<b>of virginity other than</b>
<b>that you're not married?</b>

09:11.585 --> 09:14.321
<b>I think that what they're</b>
<b>gonna be looking for in here</b>

09:14.421 --> 09:16.523
<b>is gonna be like being</b>
<b>so over the top with it.</b>

09:16.623 --> 09:17.691
<b>- Right.</b>

09:17.791 --> 09:19.659
<b>- What they want here</b>
<b>is like campy, you know?</b>

09:19.759 --> 09:21.494
<b>- Yeah. But this is hard</b>
<b>to go extreme</b>

09:21.595 --> 09:25.532
<b>being a virgin</b>
<b>and being shy.</b>

09:25.632 --> 09:27.200
<b>- I'm feeling</b>
<b>really worried</b>

09:27.300 --> 09:29.536
<b>about BeBe's choices</b>
<b>around her character.</b>

09:29.636 --> 09:30.837
<b>BeBe, up to this point,</b>

09:30.937 --> 09:33.373
<b>has just been</b>
<b>kind of poised and regal,</b>

09:33.473 --> 09:36.743
<b>so we'll see if she can</b>
<b>get down with being goofy.</b>

09:36.843 --> 09:38.044
<b>If it were me,</b>

09:38.111 --> 09:41.047
<b>I would go with the more</b>
<b>traditional kind of like...</b>

09:41.114 --> 09:42.916
<b>like, buttoned-up Catholic,</b>

09:43.049 --> 09:44.718
<b>kind of like,</b>
<b>"I only do anal</b>

09:44.818 --> 09:46.786
<b>because that still makes me</b>
<b>a virgin" kind of thing.</b>

09:46.887 --> 09:50.524
<b>- That would be very funny,</b>
<b>honey, but no.</b>

09:50.624 --> 09:53.760
<b>- I want my character</b>
<b>to be so [ bleep ] crazy</b>

09:53.860 --> 09:56.162
<b>that she's like</b>
<b>bat [ bleep ] crazy,</b>

09:56.263 --> 09:58.265
<b>that she will do anything.</b>

09:58.365 --> 10:00.300
<b>- And don't forget</b>
<b>insecurity, too.</b>

10:00.400 --> 10:01.701
<b>- Well, yeah,</b>
<b>she's insecure.</b>

10:01.801 --> 10:03.203
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- But that's the point.</b>

10:03.303 --> 10:04.905
<b>You're so insecure</b>
<b>you become crazy.</b>

10:05.071 --> 10:06.339
<b>- Okay.</b>
<b>- Like I will fake cry.</b>

10:06.439 --> 10:09.109
<b>I will put some</b>
<b>Visine tears. [ cries ]</b>

10:09.209 --> 10:10.544
<b>A needy girl</b>
<b>is easy for me.</b>

10:10.644 --> 10:13.780
<b>My strategy is to give you</b>
<b>a lot of moaning,</b>

10:13.880 --> 10:16.249
<b>aww, and a lot of, like,</b>
<b>crying sounds.</b>

10:16.349 --> 10:17.284
<b>Aah!</b>

10:17.384 --> 10:19.286
<b>I'm just gonna be crazy</b>
<b>and needy,</b>

10:19.386 --> 10:22.222
<b>kind of like a rich bitch,</b>
<b>like, vibe.</b>

10:22.322 --> 10:24.257
<b>- Ugh. I don't think</b>

10:24.357 --> 10:27.594
<b>she understands her character</b>
<b>not one bit.</b>

10:27.694 --> 10:30.463
<b>- Rich bitch,</b>
<b>religious fish.</b>

10:30.564 --> 10:34.267
<b>I used to be a Christian</b>
<b>for attention fish.</b>

10:34.367 --> 10:36.436
<b>- [ sighs ]</b>

10:36.536 --> 10:39.339
<b>- We don't know</b>
<b>what he's gonna give us.</b>

10:39.439 --> 10:40.540
<b>But whatever he says,</b>

10:40.640 --> 10:41.541
<b>we will think of the right</b>
<b>response.</b>

10:41.641 --> 10:42.843
<b>- Right.</b>
<b>And he's super dreamy.</b>

10:42.943 --> 10:43.944
<b>- Oh, my God.</b>

10:44.044 --> 10:46.046
<b>- And so I would stalk him,</b>
<b>actually.</b>

10:46.112 --> 10:48.248
<b>- Yeah. No kidding.</b>
<b>- Psychotically.</b>

10:48.348 --> 10:50.650
<b>I feel good about playing</b>
<b>the stalker bitch</b>

10:50.750 --> 10:52.686
<b>because it's sort of like</b>

10:52.786 --> 10:54.454
<b>an easy transition</b>
<b>into this role,</b>

10:54.554 --> 10:56.890
<b>because before I started</b>
<b>dating my boyfriend,</b>

10:57.057 --> 10:58.925
<b>I stalked him on MySpace,</b>

10:59.059 --> 11:02.095
<b>and just, like, check out</b>
<b>who his friends were,</b>

11:02.195 --> 11:04.865
<b>and that sort of</b>
<b>led me to, like,</b>

11:04.965 --> 11:07.200
<b>becoming friends</b>
<b>with his friends,</b>

11:07.300 --> 11:09.736
<b>and then being friends</b>
<b>with his friends</b>

11:09.836 --> 11:12.739
<b>led me to meeting him.</b>

11:12.839 --> 11:14.307
<b>So I'm very confident</b>

11:14.407 --> 11:19.079
<b>about my role</b>
<b>as psycho stalker number one.</b>

11:19.179 --> 11:20.514
<b>- Hi, what's your name?</b>

11:20.614 --> 11:24.017
<b>- Hi, I'm Chi Chi DeVayne,</b>

11:24.117 --> 11:25.585
<b>and, yeah.</b>

11:25.685 --> 11:28.355
<b>I mean, I'm just--girl,</b>
<b>I don't know how to do it.</b>

11:28.455 --> 11:30.190
<b>- Come on,</b>
<b>you got it, you got it.</b>

11:30.290 --> 11:32.759
<b>- I don't consider myself</b>
<b>to be a comedian</b>

11:32.859 --> 11:34.294
<b>or an actress and all that.</b>

11:34.394 --> 11:38.131
<b>So looking at the other girls,</b>
<b>I'm getting so intimidated.</b>

11:38.231 --> 11:42.836
<b>Like, girl, are you going to be</b>
<b>able to perform at that level?</b>

11:42.936 --> 11:45.038
<b>- How are you gonna</b>
<b>play your character?</b>

11:45.138 --> 11:47.974
<b>- What do you mean?</b>
<b>You--I mean--</b>

11:48.074 --> 11:49.709
<b>- How's she gonna talk?</b>
<b>How's she gonna act?</b>

11:51.011 --> 11:52.512
<b>- I am [ bleep ] bricks.</b>

11:52.612 --> 11:56.883
<b>I don't know if I can come up</b>
<b>with that kind of funny</b>

11:56.983 --> 11:58.485
<b>just right off the bat.</b>

11:58.585 --> 12:02.756
<b>Hi, I'm, you know,</b>
<b>Chi Chi DeVayne, and--</b>

12:02.856 --> 12:04.558
<b>- Oh, she's</b>
<b>the proper English.</b>

12:04.658 --> 12:06.493
<b>- She might be from England,</b>

12:06.593 --> 12:09.596
<b>but she still sound like</b>
<b>she from Crenshaw, too.</b>

12:10.797 --> 12:13.466
<b>- Shangela's super funny</b>
<b>and good at improv.</b>

12:13.567 --> 12:15.902
<b>If anything, I can see her</b>
<b>bulldozing Chi Chi.</b>

12:16.069 --> 12:17.103
<b>I would not want to be</b>
<b>in a group with Shangela</b>

12:17.204 --> 12:18.238
<b>to be honest with you.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

12:18.338 --> 12:20.473
<b>Do you think people say that</b>
<b>about you and I?</b>

12:20.574 --> 12:22.075
<b>- [ laughs ]</b>

12:22.108 --> 12:23.176
<b>Probably not.</b>

12:23.276 --> 12:25.979
<b>When Celine doesn't win,</b>
<b>she cries.</b>

12:26.079 --> 12:27.981
<b>- After last week,</b>
<b>I think I've learned</b>

12:28.081 --> 12:31.551
<b>that being safe</b>
<b>is clearly not okay for me.</b>

12:31.651 --> 12:33.987
<b>Even though I thought I was</b>
<b>really impressive last week,</b>

12:34.087 --> 12:37.290
<b>I'm--now is the time</b>
<b>to prove myself,</b>

12:37.390 --> 12:39.092
<b>and if I don't,</b>
<b>and if I'm safe,</b>

12:39.125 --> 12:41.895
<b>then I'm probably</b>
<b>gonna cry about it again.</b>

12:43.096 --> 12:44.297
<b>- Coming up...</b>

12:44.397 --> 12:47.434
<b>- Are you ready for the romantic</b>
<b>adventure of your life?</b>

12:47.534 --> 12:49.503
<b>- Oh.</b>
<b>- Ooh, we here.</b>

12:49.603 --> 12:50.837
<b>- Ooh.</b>

12:52.439 --> 12:54.508
<b>[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]</b>

12:58.505 --> 13:01.608
<b>- Okay, places, everyone!</b>
<b>Places, everyone!</b>

13:01.708 --> 13:03.443
<b>Oh, and don't</b>
<b>[ bleep ] it up.</b>

13:06.880 --> 13:10.150
<b>- I'm Jeffrey, and I'm here</b>
<b>to find the love of my life.</b>

13:10.250 --> 13:11.551
<b>This is not gonna be easy,</b>

13:11.651 --> 13:14.321
<b>but it never is</b>
<b>in this game we call love.</b>

13:20.193 --> 13:22.395
<b>- Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman,</b>
<b>are you ready</b>

13:22.496 --> 13:25.365
<b>for the romantic adventure</b>
<b>of your life?</b>

13:25.465 --> 13:28.335
<b>- Oh, I just want this to be</b>
<b>real, you know what I mean?</b>

13:28.435 --> 13:31.505
<b>- Oh, yeah. I know</b>
<b>exactly what you mean.</b>

13:37.811 --> 13:40.147
<b>- Do I have something</b>
<b>on my face?</b>

13:40.247 --> 13:43.116
<b>- Oh, look, here comes</b>
<b>the first girl.</b>

13:43.216 --> 13:44.351
<b>Good luck.</b>

13:44.451 --> 13:46.153
<b>- Thanks, Ru.</b>

13:51.458 --> 13:54.327
<b>- My name</b>
<b>is BeBe Zahara Benet.</b>

13:54.427 --> 13:55.629
<b>- Hi.</b>

13:55.729 --> 13:58.398
<b>- And I'm all the way</b>
<b>from Africa.</b>

13:58.498 --> 14:01.701
<b>And I came to America</b>
<b>to find my prince.</b>

14:01.802 --> 14:03.503
<b>Hi, Jeffrey.</b>

14:03.603 --> 14:04.805
<b>- You can look me</b>
<b>in the eye, you know?</b>

14:04.905 --> 14:08.074
<b>- [ laughs ]</b>
<b>Ooh, he's a handsome man,</b>

14:08.175 --> 14:10.677
<b>and I bet you</b>
<b>he has the big...</b>

14:10.777 --> 14:13.046
<b>[ laughs ]</b>

14:13.079 --> 14:14.247
<b>Oh.</b>

14:14.347 --> 14:15.882
<b>Can I tell you</b>
<b>a little secret?</b>

14:16.049 --> 14:17.083
<b>- Please, yes.</b>

14:17.184 --> 14:19.452
<b>- I'm still a virgin.</b>

14:19.553 --> 14:21.288
<b>I have a special flower.</b>

14:21.388 --> 14:23.089
<b>- Well, maybe I can take</b>
<b>a little sniff later.</b>

14:23.190 --> 14:24.391
<b>- [ chuckles ]</b>

14:24.491 --> 14:25.959
<b>- We'll see you inside.</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>

14:26.059 --> 14:27.260
<b>That's totally unnecessary.</b>

14:27.360 --> 14:28.562
<b>Wildly unnecessary.</b>

14:28.662 --> 14:30.063
<b>Thank you very much, BeBe.</b>

14:33.466 --> 14:35.869
<b>- Well, hello there,</b>
<b>handsome.</b>

14:35.969 --> 14:37.938
<b>- Whoa. Wow.</b>

14:38.071 --> 14:39.873
<b>- My name is BenDeLaCreme.</b>

14:39.973 --> 14:42.442
<b>Who's a big boy?</b>
<b>You're a big boy.</b>

14:42.542 --> 14:47.180
<b>And I'm here</b>
<b>to land me a boy-man.</b>

14:47.280 --> 14:48.582
<b>I'm BenDeLaCreme.</b>

14:48.682 --> 14:49.950
<b>- Nice to meet you BenDeLa.</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>

14:50.083 --> 14:51.685
<b>- You don't have to call me</b>
<b>BenDeLa.</b>

14:51.785 --> 14:52.686
<b>- Okay.</b>
<b>What should I call you?</b>

14:52.786 --> 14:55.222
<b>- My friends</b>
<b>call me Bedtime BD,</b>

14:55.322 --> 14:57.924
<b>because I like to tuck</b>
<b>a big boy in night-night.</b>

14:58.024 --> 15:00.060
<b>- [ laughs ]</b>

15:00.160 --> 15:02.028
<b>- You can just go on inside</b>
<b>to the house.</b>

15:02.128 --> 15:03.330
<b>I'll meet you inside</b>
<b>in a few minutes, all right?</b>

15:03.430 --> 15:04.598
<b>- Thank you so much!</b>

15:04.698 --> 15:06.633
<b>You're a beautiful driver.</b>
<b>I really appreciate it.</b>

15:06.733 --> 15:09.302
<b>Oh, my God,</b>
<b>that taxi was disgusting.</b>

15:09.402 --> 15:10.570
<b>It smelled like a barn.</b>

15:10.670 --> 15:13.240
<b>He was gross, he was late,</b>
<b>he drove like a maniac.</b>

15:13.340 --> 15:15.275
<b>Hi, I'm Trixie Mattel.</b>
<b>I'm 27 years old,</b>

<b>and I'm from</b>
<b>sunny West Hollywood.</b>

<b>And some people</b>
<b>might say I'm fake,</b>

15:18.712 --> 15:20.747
<b>but those people</b>
<b>are alcoholics.</b>

15:20.847 --> 15:22.249
<b>He's not even</b>
<b>that good looking.</b>

15:22.349 --> 15:24.551
<b>I have to go. Hi.</b>
<b>- Hi.</b>

15:24.651 --> 15:26.720
<b>- Oh, my God, you're even cuter</b>
<b>in person than you are on TV.</b>

15:26.820 --> 15:28.788
<b>- Oh, that's</b>
<b>very sweet of you.</b>

15:28.889 --> 15:30.190
<b>- You kind of have,</b>
<b>like, this sexy,</b>

15:30.290 --> 15:33.360
<b>like, Denzel,</b>
<b>like, Gilbert Godfried,</b>

15:33.460 --> 15:35.795
<b>like, but, like, sensual,</b>
<b>do you know what I mean?</b>

15:35.896 --> 15:36.863
<b>- Uh...</b>

15:36.963 --> 15:39.199
<b>- I like my men</b>
<b>like I like my coffee...</b>

15:39.299 --> 15:41.568
<b>incapable of loving me back.</b>

15:41.668 --> 15:42.602
<b>[ sighs ]</b>

15:42.702 --> 15:43.837
<b>Bye, Jason!</b>

15:43.937 --> 15:45.305
<b>Sorry, it's Jared.</b>

15:45.405 --> 15:47.307
<b>- Jeff. Jeffrey.</b>

15:49.776 --> 15:52.212
<b>- I'm Milk.</b>
<b>I'm from New York City.</b>

15:52.312 --> 15:55.749
<b>I kind of move around a lot</b>
<b>in life for legal reasons.</b>

15:55.849 --> 15:57.450
<b>Is it okay if I step out?</b>

15:57.551 --> 15:59.286
<b>I know</b>
<b>this is less than 500 feet.</b>

15:59.386 --> 16:02.322
<b>Some people say</b>
<b>I'm, like, psycho,</b>

16:02.422 --> 16:04.825
<b>but I just say I'm really</b>
<b>passionate about love.</b>

16:04.925 --> 16:06.059
<b>[ giggles ]</b>

16:06.159 --> 16:09.029
<b>- Nice to meet you--</b>
<b>Ooh, okay.</b>

16:09.062 --> 16:10.931
<b>- I'm his biggest fan,</b>
<b>and it's unreal</b>

16:11.031 --> 16:13.033
<b>to see the star</b>
<b>of "UnREAL."</b>

16:13.099 --> 16:14.100
<b>I'm in love.</b>

16:18.939 --> 16:21.374
<b>- I have to open it myself.</b>

16:21.475 --> 16:23.176
<b>My name is Aja,</b>
<b>and this is Woofy.</b>

16:23.276 --> 16:24.911
<b>Woof. Oh.</b>

16:25.045 --> 16:28.515
<b>He's the only person who</b>
<b>actually stays by my side.</b>

16:28.615 --> 16:29.883
<b>Oh, my God!</b>

16:30.050 --> 16:33.119
<b>When I first saw Jeffrey,</b>
<b>I just knew from that moment</b>

16:33.220 --> 16:37.157
<b>that I would do anything</b>
<b>to have him.</b>

16:37.257 --> 16:39.759
<b>I will kill someone.</b>

16:41.661 --> 16:43.063
<b>Can you believe they made me</b>
<b>open the door by myself?</b>

16:43.129 --> 16:45.332
<b>I didn't even close it.</b>
<b>Should I go close it?</b>

16:45.432 --> 16:47.534
<b>- I think maybe</b>
<b>you better close it.</b>

16:49.469 --> 16:50.804
<b>- I don't do anything</b>
<b>for myself,</b>

16:50.904 --> 16:52.072

19:39.639 --> 19:43.176
<b>Oh, that's totally</b>

19:43.276 --> 19:45.545

19:45.645 --> 19:46.813
<b>This is one of my favorite</b>

<b>- Let me just</b>

<b>who is clean,</b>

20:38.631 --> 20:40.633
<b>clean down there.</b>

20:40.733 --> 20:42.268

20:55.915 --> 20:57.250
<b>I'm the wrong gal</b>

20:57.350 --> 20:59.952

21:00.053 --> 21:01.921
<b>We'll have</b>
<b>a lot more opportunities</b>

21:02.021 --> 21:03.056
<b>to get to know each other</b>

21:03.222 --> 21:04.057

22:02.982 --> 22:04.951

<b>What? [ sighs ]</b>
<b>Oh, my God.</b>

22:19.332 --> 22:22.902

23:32.305 --> 23:35.808
<b>- Can we propose to me</b>

23:35.908 --> 23:38.244

<b>I couldn't find within myself?</b>

23:38.277 --> 23:41.647
<b>Nobody's ever loved me like</b>

<b>he turned out</b>
<b>to be a crackhead.</b>

24:29.429 --> 24:32.231
<b>And he stole all my [ bleep ]</b>
<b>out of my apartment,</b>

24:32.332 --> 24:34.033
<b>but I found him, though,</b>

24:34.133 --> 24:35.134
<b>and shot his ass.</b>

24:35.234 --> 24:36.235
<b>- [ Michelle laughs ]</b>

24:36.269 --> 24:37.670
<b>- Ladies,</b>
<b>I wanna know something.</b>

24:37.770 --> 24:38.805
<b>- What?</b>
<b>- What?</b>

24:38.905 --> 24:40.606
<b>- What's your favorite part</b>
<b>of my body?</b>

24:40.707 --> 24:42.141
<b>- That dick.</b>

24:42.241 --> 24:44.444
<b>- [ laughs ]</b>
<b>- That's so vulgar.</b>

24:44.544 --> 24:47.347
<b>My favorite part of your body</b>
<b>is your everything.</b>

24:52.352 --> 24:54.420
<b>- Hey, baby.</b>
<b>- Oh, my God.</b>

24:54.520 --> 24:55.922
<b>Oh, no.</b>

24:56.022 --> 24:59.892
<b>- Kennedy</b>
<b>is blowing my mind.</b>

24:59.993 --> 25:01.194
<b>She is doing it.</b>

25:01.227 --> 25:02.228
<b>- It's hot.</b>

25:02.328 --> 25:04.197
<b>- Don't you have</b>
<b>another bottle of alcohol?</b>

25:04.263 --> 25:05.698
<b>- It's hot, bitch.</b>

25:05.798 --> 25:06.966
<b>It's hotter than [ bleep ].</b>

25:07.066 --> 25:08.735
<b>- Then get out!</b>

25:10.870 --> 25:12.538
<b>- Is she okay?</b>
<b>- I'm a man.</b>

25:12.638 --> 25:14.240
<b>- [ laughs ]</b>

25:15.508 --> 25:18.578
<b>- Ladies, I thought</b>
<b>we would just take a little time</b>

25:18.678 --> 25:21.714
<b>to relax and unwind</b>
<b>and take our clothes off.</b>

25:21.814 --> 25:24.250
<b>- Are you into the whole</b>
<b>polyamorous thing?</b>

25:24.350 --> 25:26.285
<b>- I'm open to everything.</b>
<b>- Oh, are you?</b>

25:26.386 --> 25:28.655
<b>We've been looking for somebody</b>
<b>to be a little more open.</b>

25:28.755 --> 25:30.523
<b>- I mean, how wide</b>
<b>are you willing to go?</b>

25:30.623 --> 25:33.126
<b>So how did you two</b>
<b>come together?</b>

25:33.226 --> 25:35.528
<b>- I think it was fate,</b>
<b>right, Chi Chi?</b>

25:35.628 --> 25:39.899
<b>- Well, Mama found me,</b>
<b>you know, at a strip club.</b>

25:39.999 --> 25:41.734
<b>That's Mama.</b>

25:41.834 --> 25:44.237
<b>Mama found me</b>
<b>at a strip club.</b>

25:44.337 --> 25:45.805
<b>- You've heard</b>
<b>of sister wives?</b>

25:45.905 --> 25:47.774
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- We are sister wives.</b>

25:47.874 --> 25:49.976
<b>- Sister wives.</b>
<b>- Yeah, how about that?</b>

25:50.076 --> 25:53.012
<b>- Oh, my God,</b>
<b>you just so...</b>

25:53.179 --> 25:54.080
<b>- Here, touch me, too,</b>
<b>though.</b>

25:54.180 --> 25:55.748
<b>- Yeah, yeah.</b>
<b>Go for it.</b>

25:55.848 --> 25:58.351
<b>- Mama said</b>
<b>I could have real meat now.</b>

25:58.451 --> 25:59.619
<b>- Oh. [ laughs ]</b>

25:59.719 --> 26:00.620
<b>- Let's see what's going on</b>

26:00.720 --> 26:02.188
<b>down in the meat department.</b>

26:04.057 --> 26:05.258
<b>My mission while I'm here</b>

26:05.358 --> 26:09.062
<b>is to get me a nice,</b>
<b>strong, firm plastic cup</b>

26:09.195 --> 26:11.497
<b>and get me some</b>
<b>of that Jeffrey sperm in it</b>

26:11.597 --> 26:14.467
<b>so Chi Chi and I can make</b>
<b>the family we've always wanted.</b>

26:14.567 --> 26:16.436
<b>- [ laughs ]</b>

26:16.536 --> 26:19.072
<b>- I ain't seen nothing</b>
<b>that big and black in the water</b>

26:19.205 --> 26:20.473
<b>since I took you</b>
<b>to Sea World.</b>

26:20.573 --> 26:21.941
<b>Whoo!</b>

26:22.041 --> 26:23.943
<b>- Shamu.</b>

26:24.043 --> 26:26.512
<b>- Oh, now those are balls!</b>

26:26.612 --> 26:28.748
<b>Those are big balls!</b>

26:28.848 --> 26:32.118
<b>- Shangela is so over the top</b>
<b>with her persona, you know,</b>

26:32.218 --> 26:33.219
<b>and she's</b>
<b>cracking her jokes.</b>

26:33.286 --> 26:34.554
<b>- One of y'all</b>
<b>needs to shave.</b>

26:34.654 --> 26:37.223
<b>Nobody told me</b>
<b>Bush was back in office.</b>

26:37.290 --> 26:39.225
<b>- [ laughs ]</b>

26:39.258 --> 26:41.327
<b>- Chi Chi's just drowning</b>
<b>in the tub, honey.</b>

26:41.427 --> 26:45.064
<b>- My dream date is...</b>

26:45.164 --> 26:48.401
<b>whatever</b>
<b>mother wants me to have.</b>

26:48.501 --> 26:49.569
<b>- Ugh.</b>

26:49.669 --> 26:51.337
<b>- We're a two-piece combo</b>
<b>over here.</b>

26:51.437 --> 26:53.172
<b>- All right.</b>
<b>- You wanna hang out with Sugar,</b>

26:53.239 --> 26:56.776
<b>then you gotta</b>
<b>come through me.</b>

26:56.876 --> 26:57.810
<b>- [ laughs ]</b>

26:57.910 --> 26:59.579
<b>- If Jeffrey</b>
<b>gets me and Shangela</b>

26:59.679 --> 27:03.216
<b>in the fantasy suite,</b>
<b>it's going down.</b>

27:03.316 --> 27:04.817
<b>[ laughs ]</b>

27:06.586 --> 27:08.221
<b>- Chi Chi had</b>
<b>a special question for you</b>

27:08.321 --> 27:09.389
<b>that she wanted to ask you.</b>

27:09.489 --> 27:10.390
<b>- Go for it, Chi Chi.</b>

27:10.490 --> 27:12.191
<b>- Chi Chi?</b>

27:12.258 --> 27:14.327
<b>- [ deep voice ]</b>
<b>Do you wanna have my baby?</b>

27:14.427 --> 27:16.896
<b>- Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!</b>

27:17.964 --> 27:19.966
<b>- Ladies, it's time</b>

27:20.066 --> 27:25.104
<b>for the most dramatic</b>
<b>eggplant ceremony in herstory.</b>

27:25.204 --> 27:29.275
<b>- Ladies, I just really</b>
<b>want this love to be real,</b>

27:29.375 --> 27:32.412
<b>and, frankly, most of y'all</b>
<b>scare the hell out of me.</b>

27:33.980 --> 27:37.684
<b>Which is why I've decided</b>
<b>to give this eggplant...</b>

27:39.919 --> 27:41.587
<b>To Ru.</b>

27:42.689 --> 27:45.158
<b>Will you accept</b>
<b>my eggplant, Ru?</b>

27:46.893 --> 27:49.929
<b>- I will take</b>
<b>all your eggplants.</b>

27:52.298 --> 27:53.866
<b>- What?</b>
<b>- No!</b>

27:58.037 --> 28:00.707
<b>- Way to go, RuPaul,</b>
<b>way to go!</b>

28:00.807 --> 28:03.009
<b>- Bye-ee!</b>

28:03.176 --> 28:06.446
<b>Finally, this is</b>
<b>my happily ever after.</b>

28:06.546 --> 28:08.047
<b>Next stop,</b>
<b>"Good Morning America."</b>

28:08.181 --> 28:10.350
<b>We'll do</b>
<b>"Dancing with the Stars,"</b>

28:10.450 --> 28:12.518
<b>and then we'll get divorced.</b>

28:15.989 --> 28:16.956
<b>- Coming up...</b>

28:17.056 --> 28:19.092
<b>- Milk, Milk, Milk.</b>

28:19.192 --> 28:20.360
<b>It's just hurtful</b>

28:20.460 --> 28:22.495
<b>because I thought we were</b>
<b>all better than that.</b>

28:22.595 --> 28:24.263
<b>But y'all feelings</b>
<b>is really hurt.</b>

28:24.364 --> 28:25.898
<b>- I'm paying no attention.</b>

28:25.999 --> 28:27.700
<b>That's dumb.</b>

28:27.800 --> 28:29.869
<b>[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]</b>

28:34.188 --> 28:37.057
<b>Hi, guys. Good morning.</b>

28:37.158 --> 28:40.995
<b>- This week's runway</b>
<b>is Wigs On Wigs On Wigs,</b>

28:41.095 --> 28:42.730
<b>inspired by Roxxxy Andrews.</b>

28:42.830 --> 28:45.032
<b>- Welcome to another day</b>
<b>at the office.</b>

28:45.132 --> 28:46.500
<b>Aren't you feeling gorgeous?</b>

28:46.600 --> 28:48.769
<b>Aren't you feeling</b>
<b>technically amazing?</b>

28:48.869 --> 28:51.105
<b>- Milk someday wants to have</b>
<b>a challenge inspired by her,</b>

28:51.205 --> 28:52.406
<b>and I bet you next season</b>

28:52.506 --> 28:54.241
<b>there will be, like,</b>
<b>this week on the runway</b>

28:54.341 --> 28:56.443
<b>you'll be crying</b>
<b>because you're only safe.</b>

28:56.544 --> 28:58.813
<b>[ laughs ]</b>

28:58.913 --> 29:00.748
<b>- New day.</b>
<b>- New day.</b>

29:00.848 --> 29:01.916
<b>- New day, sis.</b>

29:02.016 --> 29:03.517
<b>- Y'all can't handle</b>
<b>all this cuteness.</b>

29:03.617 --> 29:06.454
<b>I'm about to feel real cute.</b>

29:06.554 --> 29:08.622
<b>- I'm going through it.</b>

29:08.722 --> 29:10.691
<b>I'm going through it</b>
<b>in my head.</b>

29:10.791 --> 29:13.494
<b>I mean, yesterday was bad.</b>

29:13.594 --> 29:16.697
<b>On Season 8, I just</b>
<b>doubted myself so much.</b>

29:16.797 --> 29:18.766
<b>I often asked myself, like,</b>

29:18.866 --> 29:21.068
<b>what the hell</b>
<b>are you doing here?</b>

29:21.168 --> 29:24.405
<b>And, like, how could I compete</b>
<b>with girls like this,</b>

29:24.505 --> 29:25.473
<b>you know what I mean?</b>

29:25.573 --> 29:27.241
<b>These bitches</b>
<b>have fabulous costumes,</b>

29:27.341 --> 29:31.245
<b>and I'm gonna walk out</b>
<b>in a neon bathing suit.</b>

29:31.345 --> 29:33.948
<b>So if it seems like</b>
<b>I'm a little worried, I am.</b>

29:34.048 --> 29:35.483
<b>That's why I'm quiet.</b>

29:35.583 --> 29:38.352
<b>I'm distancing myself</b>
<b>from the girls.</b>

29:40.187 --> 29:43.057
<b>I thought that</b>
<b>I had elevated my drag,</b>

29:43.157 --> 29:44.859
<b>but here we go again.</b>

29:44.959 --> 29:46.794
<b>Like,</b>
<b>what are you gonna say,</b>

29:46.894 --> 29:48.429
<b>like, what are you gonna do</b>

29:48.529 --> 29:53.267
<b>to, like, match these girls'</b>
<b>energy and funniness?</b>

29:53.367 --> 29:54.935
<b>I'm just trying</b>
<b>to keep a positive head.</b>

29:55.035 --> 29:56.237
<b>I'm trying to keep smiling,</b>

29:56.370 --> 29:59.974
<b>but at the same time,</b>
<b>I am nervous.</b>

30:00.074 --> 30:01.475
<b>I don't want to go home.</b>

30:01.575 --> 30:03.110
<b>I'm gonna show them that,</b>
<b>you know,</b>

30:03.210 --> 30:06.380
<b>I have what it takes</b>
<b>to go all the way.</b>

30:07.548 --> 30:08.582
<b>- How are you?</b>

30:08.682 --> 30:10.217
<b>- I really, really</b>
<b>wanna win a challenge.</b>

30:10.384 --> 30:11.819
<b>I've never even</b>
<b>been in the top,</b>

30:11.919 --> 30:13.954
<b>so I really hope today</b>
<b>it can happen.</b>

30:14.054 --> 30:15.523
<b>The first time</b>
<b>I was on "Drag Race,"</b>

30:15.623 --> 30:17.691
<b>I kinda just floated</b>
<b>until I got flushed.</b>

30:17.792 --> 30:18.859
<b>All people knew about me</b>

30:18.959 --> 30:21.996
<b>was that I did not excel</b>
<b>at "Drag Race"</b>

30:22.096 --> 30:23.864
<b>and didn't win</b>
<b>any challenges,</b>

30:23.964 --> 30:25.599
<b>and I never had</b>
<b>my star moments.</b>

30:25.699 --> 30:27.034
<b>This time I, like,</b>
<b>have to change that.</b>

30:27.134 --> 30:29.036
<b>I don't really, like,</b>
<b>need validation,</b>

30:29.136 --> 30:31.672
<b>but, like, to have</b>
<b>one good week here</b>

30:31.772 --> 30:33.440
<b>would really help the momentum</b>
<b>for the rest, you know.</b>

30:33.541 --> 30:34.809
<b>- I feel you.</b>

30:34.909 --> 30:37.178
<b>- Being safe all the time</b>
<b>you start to feel invisible.</b>

30:37.344 --> 30:39.480
<b>In the real world,</b>
<b>I'm Beyonce,</b>

30:39.580 --> 30:41.816
<b>but in the "Drag Race" world,</b>
<b>I'm just a LaTavia.</b>

30:41.916 --> 30:43.184
<b>It doesn't matter</b>
<b>on "Drag Race"</b>

30:43.350 --> 30:44.685
<b>what you've done</b>
<b>in the real world.</b>

30:44.785 --> 30:46.687
<b>In these four</b>
<b>fake brick walls,</b>

30:46.787 --> 30:49.590
<b>you are garbage</b>
<b>until proven otherwise.</b>

30:50.891 --> 30:52.026
<b>- Is there anybody</b>

30:52.126 --> 30:54.361
<b>that either of you</b>
<b>are, like, concerned about?</b>

30:54.395 --> 30:57.531
<b>It's kind of hard to figure out</b>
<b>who the bottom two are.</b>

30:57.631 --> 30:58.899
<b>Like. I feel like--</b>
<b>- Oh, let's say three.</b>

30:58.999 --> 31:00.901
<b>Who would you think</b>
<b>the three are?</b>

31:01.001 --> 31:03.437
<b>- I mean,</b>
<b>if I were gonna say three,</b>

31:03.537 --> 31:06.974
<b>I would say Aja, Chi Chi,</b>
<b>and possibly BeBe.</b>

31:07.074 --> 31:08.809
<b>- What do you feel, Milk?</b>

31:08.909 --> 31:10.211
<b>- I'd have</b>
<b>to agree with Ben.</b>

31:10.377 --> 31:12.613
<b>- I feel like two out of three</b>
<b>of those are correct,</b>

31:12.713 --> 31:14.381
<b>and my third variable one</b>

31:14.482 --> 31:15.783
<b>that I kept going</b>
<b>back and forth on</b>

31:15.883 --> 31:19.887
<b>was between Aja's and yours.</b>

31:19.987 --> 31:22.723
<b>- I'm not fazed by Shangela</b>

31:22.823 --> 31:25.259
<b>thinking that I may be</b>
<b>in the bottom.</b>

31:25.392 --> 31:26.660
<b>That's dumb.</b>

31:26.760 --> 31:29.763
<b>So I'm just gonna turn my</b>
<b>hearing aid down a little bit</b>

31:29.864 --> 31:31.365
<b>and just, like,</b>
<b>let her speak,</b>

31:31.465 --> 31:33.634
<b>but I'm paying no attention.</b>

31:33.734 --> 31:35.469
<b>I thought I killed it.</b>

31:35.569 --> 31:39.240
<b>The idea of being in the top</b>
<b>is so exciting.</b>

31:39.340 --> 31:40.708
<b>- Well, halle-loo.</b>

31:40.808 --> 31:42.676
<b>Oh, Miss Thing,</b>
<b>I'm looking at her, like,</b>

31:42.776 --> 31:45.880
<b>you don't see</b>
<b>the writing on the wall?</b>

31:45.980 --> 31:47.948
<b>Mama, she really thinks</b>

31:48.048 --> 31:50.417
<b>that she's in the top two</b>
<b>on this one.</b>

31:52.052 --> 31:54.889
<b>I'm cracked. [ laughs ]</b>

31:59.593 --> 32:00.928
<b>- [ bleep ]</b>

32:01.028 --> 32:02.196
<b>It's just hurtful</b>

32:02.363 --> 32:04.231
<b>because I thought</b>
<b>we were all better than that.</b>

32:04.365 --> 32:06.367
<b>- I think I would've chosen</b>
<b>Thorgy to stay.</b>

32:06.433 --> 32:12.373
<b>I find Thorgy's concepts</b>
<b>and her look much more exciting.</b>

32:12.406 --> 32:13.808
<b>- [ bleep ] my drag, right?</b>

32:13.908 --> 32:15.442
<b>- Bitch, your feelings</b>
<b>is really hurt.</b>

32:15.543 --> 32:16.443
<b>- Yep.</b>

32:16.544 --> 32:18.078
<b>- Kennedy is really upset</b>

32:18.179 --> 32:19.446
<b>because it wasn't right</b>
<b>for Milk to say</b>

32:19.547 --> 32:21.382
<b>that Kennedy</b>
<b>should have gone home</b>

32:21.415 --> 32:22.750
<b>because her looks</b>
<b>weren't on point,</b>

32:22.850 --> 32:25.085
<b>because this is a competition</b>
<b>about more than just your looks.</b>

32:25.186 --> 32:27.221
<b>And Kennedy proved this week</b>

32:27.388 --> 32:30.624
<b>that she deserves</b>
<b>to be here 100%.</b>

32:30.724 --> 32:32.226
<b>- If you don't care about me</b>

32:32.326 --> 32:33.427
<b>and you don't care</b>
<b>about my style of drag,</b>

32:33.527 --> 32:34.995
<b>you're entitled to that.</b>

32:35.095 --> 32:36.931
<b>I'm upset at the fact</b>
<b>that we work together</b>

32:37.031 --> 32:38.999
<b>a lot of times,</b>

32:39.099 --> 32:41.335
<b>and what's hurtful</b>
<b>is when you feel like</b>

32:41.402 --> 32:43.003
<b>you have</b>
<b>this certain relationship</b>

32:43.103 --> 32:45.673
<b>with your so-called sister,</b>

32:45.773 --> 32:48.509
<b>and you come to find out</b>
<b>it's something else.</b>

32:48.609 --> 32:51.011
<b>And they end up reading you</b>
<b>like a dog and stuff,</b>

32:51.111 --> 32:52.780
<b>throwing you under the bus.</b>

<b>become Naomi's balls?</b>

41:22.798 --> 41:24.466
<b>Turns out yes.</b>
<b>[ all laugh ]</b>

41:24.566 --> 41:28.370
<b>- In "The Bitchelor,"</b>
<b>your character was so spot on.</b>

41:28.470 --> 41:30.739
<b>It was basically</b>
<b>Paris Hilton.</b>

41:30.772 --> 41:33.509
<b>- I was very impressed from</b>
<b>the second you walked out.</b>

41:33.609 --> 41:35.444
<b>You were on the phone and</b>
<b>you weren't paying attention,</b>

41:35.544 --> 41:37.746
<b>and it was like, oh,</b>
<b>we know exactly who you are,</b>

41:37.846 --> 41:39.848
<b>and it was</b>
<b>everything I wanted.</b>

41:39.948 --> 41:41.016
<b>- But I felt like</b>

41:41.116 --> 41:43.185
<b>you were getting talked over</b>
<b>a little bit.</b>

41:43.285 --> 41:45.854
<b>- We were advised to try</b>
<b>not to talk over each other.</b>

41:45.954 --> 41:47.122
<b>It was kind of like</b>
<b>jump roping.</b>

41:47.222 --> 41:49.358
<b>I was kind of waiting</b>
<b>sometimes for the moment.</b>

41:49.458 --> 41:50.526
<b>- I felt you waiting.</b>

41:50.692 --> 41:53.128
<b>- However, when you did</b>
<b>get those lines in,</b>

41:53.228 --> 41:54.830
<b>they were hilarious.</b>

41:54.930 --> 41:57.099
<b>- All right,</b>
<b>well, thanks Trixie.</b>

41:57.199 --> 41:58.534
<b>Up next, Milk.</b>

41:58.700 --> 42:00.002
<b>- Hi.</b>

42:00.102 --> 42:01.403
<b>- You look gorgeous tonight.</b>

42:01.503 --> 42:02.437
<b>- Thank you.</b>

42:02.538 --> 42:03.438
<b>- This is a great look</b>
<b>for you.</b>

42:03.539 --> 42:05.340
<b>- Thank you.</b>
<b>- In the wig reveal,</b>

42:05.440 --> 42:07.810
<b>I liked that there was</b>
<b>another sort of reveal</b>

42:07.910 --> 42:09.144
<b>when you pulled the pony,</b>

42:09.244 --> 42:10.345
<b>like those dolls that</b>
<b>I always that I always wanted</b>

42:10.445 --> 42:11.513
<b>that my parents</b>
<b>wouldn't get me.</b>

42:11.613 --> 42:12.714
<b>- Crissy Doll.</b>
<b>- Yeah, Crissy Doll.</b>

42:12.815 --> 42:14.716
<b>- Crissy Doll's</b>
<b>my favorite doll of all time,</b>

42:14.783 --> 42:17.119
<b>but we could see</b>
<b>the black cup holder</b>

42:17.219 --> 42:18.821
<b>underneath the blonde hair.</b>

42:18.921 --> 42:20.722
<b>- Yeah, it's dark root.</b>

42:20.756 --> 42:23.492
<b>- In the challenge,</b>
<b>you were terrifying.</b>

42:23.592 --> 42:25.294
<b>- I know. [ laughs ]</b>

42:25.394 --> 42:27.496
<b>I was--</b>
<b>I was actually psycho.</b>

42:27.596 --> 42:31.633
<b>- But it was the same note</b>
<b>the whole time.</b>

42:31.733 --> 42:33.836
<b>I kept hoping that</b>
<b>you were going to pretend</b>

42:33.936 --> 42:35.471
<b>like you weren't a stalker</b>

42:35.571 --> 42:37.840
<b>and there wasn't anything wrong</b>
<b>with what you were doing,</b>

42:37.940 --> 42:40.042
<b>and you're just</b>
<b>a really nice, friendly person</b>

42:40.142 --> 42:42.578
<b>who happens to know</b>
<b>everything about you.</b>

42:42.678 --> 42:44.179
<b>Because there are times</b>
<b>when less is more.</b>

42:44.279 --> 42:46.815
<b>- Your foot was on the gas</b>
<b>the whole time.</b>

42:46.915 --> 42:50.118
<b>You were going so fast,</b>
<b>you weren't sharing the stage.</b>

42:50.219 --> 42:52.521
<b>- Up next, Aja.</b>

42:52.688 --> 42:54.356
<b>- Hi.</b>
<b>- Tonight on the runway,</b>

42:54.456 --> 42:56.158
<b>I'm going to go</b>
<b>out on a limb</b>

42:56.258 --> 42:59.428
<b>and say this right now was</b>
<b>the best Aja has ever looked.</b>

42:59.528 --> 43:00.829
<b>- Oh, thank you.</b>

43:00.929 --> 43:02.531
<b>- From the second</b>
<b>you walked out,</b>

43:02.698 --> 43:05.567
<b>I just said, what is that,</b>
<b>and I need more.</b>

43:05.701 --> 43:08.570
<b>- You're giving me</b>
<b>street fighter couture,</b>

43:08.704 --> 43:10.272
<b>and it's incredible.</b>

43:10.372 --> 43:12.307
<b>Yes, hyah.</b>
<b>- Win.</b>

43:12.407 --> 43:13.308
<b>- So in "The Bitchelor,"</b>

43:13.408 --> 43:16.011
<b>I didn't get needy girl</b>
<b>at all,</b>

43:16.111 --> 43:18.080
<b>not even a little.</b>

43:18.180 --> 43:19.081
<b>- Oh, my God.</b>

43:19.181 --> 43:20.749
<b>- What I got</b>
<b>was a whiny brat,</b>

43:20.849 --> 43:22.784
<b>and that</b>
<b>is not the character.</b>

43:22.885 --> 43:26.321
<b>- You were giving me</b>
<b>more Cher Horowitz than Tai.</b>

43:26.421 --> 43:29.191
<b>- Oh. To me, needy</b>
<b>has always been spoiled,</b>

43:29.291 --> 43:31.226
<b>but maybe I guess</b>
<b>there is a difference.</b>

43:31.326 --> 43:33.228
<b>- Needy is not spoiled.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

43:33.328 --> 43:34.496
<b>- They're</b>
<b>two different things.</b>

43:34.596 --> 43:37.800
<b>Needy is constantly needing</b>
<b>somebody to be approving</b>

43:37.900 --> 43:39.101
<b>or to tell you</b>
<b>how beautiful you are.</b>

43:39.201 --> 43:41.737
<b>- Please love me,</b>
<b>please tell me I'm pretty,</b>

43:41.770 --> 43:44.573
<b>that kind of insecure girl.</b>

43:44.673 --> 43:46.375
<b>- It's exhausting</b>
<b>to the person.</b>

43:46.475 --> 43:47.476
<b>- Mm-hmm.</b>

43:47.576 --> 43:48.477
<b>- I feel like</b>
<b>I need to reevaluate</b>

43:48.577 --> 43:49.478
<b>the definition of needy now.</b>

43:49.578 --> 43:51.046
<b>I was trying to give you,</b>
<b>like,</b>

43:51.146 --> 43:52.514
<b>a little bit of, like,</b>
<b>Farrah Moan</b>

43:52.681 --> 43:53.982
<b>meets, like, Kim Kardashian</b>

43:54.082 --> 43:57.352
<b>meets, like, kind of like</b>
<b>crazy girlfriend. Wah.</b>

43:57.452 --> 44:00.989
<b>Like, that's</b>
<b>what I was going for.</b>

44:01.089 --> 44:03.058
<b>- Up next,</b>
<b>Kennedy Davenport.</b>

44:03.158 --> 44:05.093
<b>Helleer.</b>
<b>- Hi.</b>

44:05.194 --> 44:06.829
<b>- On the runway tonight,</b>
<b>it was gorgeous,</b>

44:06.929 --> 44:09.364
<b>and I think</b>
<b>it was truly Davenport.</b>

44:09.465 --> 44:11.467
<b>- It was spectacular.</b>

44:11.567 --> 44:13.602
<b>The absolute polar opposite</b>

44:13.702 --> 44:15.704
<b>of the character</b>
<b>you played on the show.</b>

44:15.737 --> 44:17.940
<b>- The challenge,</b>
<b>out of all of the girls,</b>

44:18.040 --> 44:21.176
<b>I had the hardest time keeping</b>
<b>a straight face with you.</b>

44:21.276 --> 44:23.145
<b>From the teeth to the tits</b>
<b>to the ass,</b>

44:23.245 --> 44:25.714
<b>you were</b>
<b>absolutely hilarious.</b>

44:25.814 --> 44:26.882
<b>- I never think of you</b>

44:26.982 --> 44:29.318
<b>as like really a comedy queen,</b>
<b>but you are.</b>

44:29.418 --> 44:31.587
<b>- Well, she did win Snatch Game</b>
<b>on her season.</b>

44:31.720 --> 44:32.855
<b>- That's right.</b>

44:32.955 --> 44:34.089
<b>- Why don't I think of you</b>
<b>as comedy?</b>

44:34.189 --> 44:36.425
<b>- It's probably because</b>
<b>of her criminal record.</b>

44:36.525 --> 44:39.061
<b>[ all laugh ]</b>

44:39.161 --> 44:40.596
<b>Thank you.</b>
<b>- Thank you.</b>

44:40.729 --> 44:42.664
<b>- Up next, Chi Chi DeVayne.</b>

44:42.698 --> 44:43.866
<b>- Hey, y'all.</b>

44:43.966 --> 44:45.434
<b>- You look beautiful</b>
<b>tonight.</b>

44:45.534 --> 44:46.668
<b>You took my breath away</b>

44:46.768 --> 44:48.070
<b>from the moment that you</b>
<b>stepped out on the runway.</b>

44:48.170 --> 44:49.371
<b>You just have an aura</b>
<b>about you</b>

44:49.471 --> 44:52.674
<b>that is just so bright,</b>
<b>it's really quite stunning.</b>

44:52.708 --> 44:56.545
<b>- You have presence just</b>
<b>standing here right now,</b>

44:56.678 --> 44:58.747
<b>but then in "The Bitchelor,"</b>

44:58.847 --> 45:01.550
<b>you were constantly</b>
<b>overshadowed.</b>

45:01.683 --> 45:03.785
<b>- Shangela had joke</b>
<b>after joke after joke,</b>

45:03.886 --> 45:06.688
<b>but you sort of were</b>
<b>a spectator in the scene.</b>

45:06.788 --> 45:08.557
<b>- In that hot tub,</b>

45:08.690 --> 45:09.892
<b>I wouldn't even have noticed</b>
<b>that you were there</b>

45:09.992 --> 45:11.326
<b>until you were kissing up</b>
<b>on his boobies.</b>

45:11.426 --> 45:13.562
<b>- You gave it all away</b>
<b>to Shangela.</b>

45:13.695 --> 45:15.998
<b>I understand</b>
<b>you were playing the bottom,</b>

45:16.098 --> 45:18.267
<b>but if you're gonna be a bottom,</b>
<b>at least be a power bottom.</b>

45:18.367 --> 45:19.268
<b>- Uh-huh.</b>

45:19.368 --> 45:21.270
<b>- When you did have</b>
<b>a moment,</b>

45:21.370 --> 45:24.173
<b>when you leaned over</b>
<b>into his ear and said...</b>

45:24.273 --> 45:25.707
<b>- [ deep voice ]</b>
<b>You wanna have my baby?</b>

45:25.808 --> 45:27.376
<b>- I mean,</b>
<b>that was incredible.</b>

45:27.476 --> 45:29.711
<b>Where was that</b>
<b>for the rest of the show?</b>

45:29.745 --> 45:31.613
<b>- I don't know.</b>

45:31.713 --> 45:32.714
<b>I don't--I don't know.</b>

45:32.748 --> 45:35.284
<b>I went</b>
<b>and I just felt like crap</b>

45:35.384 --> 45:36.985
<b>compared to</b>
<b>all of these comedy queens,</b>

45:37.085 --> 45:38.754
<b>and I let it get to me.</b>

45:38.854 --> 45:42.491
<b>I just got so intimidated,</b>
<b>and it's frustrating</b>

45:42.658 --> 45:43.892
<b>because I don't want you</b>
<b>to think</b>

45:43.992 --> 45:45.661
<b>that I don't want to be here</b>
<b>and that I'm not trying.</b>

45:45.727 --> 45:47.830
<b>I don't want to upset you</b>
<b>for bringing me back.</b>

45:47.930 --> 45:50.299
<b>I'm sorry, y'all.</b>

45:50.399 --> 45:53.569
<b>I'm just so sorry</b>
<b>that I'm not giving my 100.</b>

45:53.669 --> 45:57.072
<b>I'm letting</b>
<b>what they're doing affect me</b>

45:57.172 --> 46:00.843
<b>and just me not thinking</b>
<b>that I'm worth it.</b>

46:00.943 --> 46:03.345
<b>- Chi Chi, you're worth it.</b>
<b>You're worth it.</b>

46:03.445 --> 46:06.181
<b>- Thank you, Chi Chi.</b>

46:06.281 --> 46:09.151
<b>Now, based on</b>
<b>the judges' critiques,</b>

46:09.251 --> 46:11.186
<b>I've made some decisions.</b>

46:13.222 --> 46:15.724
<b>Kennedy Davenport,</b>

46:15.824 --> 46:18.994
<b>BenDeLaCreme,</b>

46:19.094 --> 46:21.563
<b>you are the top two All Stars</b>
<b>of the week.</b>

46:21.697 --> 46:23.699
<b>[ applause ]</b>
<b>Con-drag-ulations.</b>

46:23.799 --> 46:27.703
<b>You've each won</b>
<b>a suite of jewelry</b>

46:27.736 --> 46:30.305
<b>from Fierce! Drag Jewels</b>

46:30.405 --> 46:35.844
<b>and a $1,000 gift card</b>
<b>from Nailed by Cristy.</b>

46:37.479 --> 46:42.417
<b>Trixie Mattel,</b>
<b>you are a totally fake bitch.</b>

46:42.518 --> 46:46.255
<b>- [ chuckles ]</b>
<b>- And I loved it.</b>

46:46.355 --> 46:48.056
<b>You are safe.</b>

46:48.157 --> 46:54.096
<b>Milk, Aja, Chi Chi,</b>
<b>you are in the bottom three.</b>

46:56.965 --> 46:59.001
<b>DeLa and Kennedy,</b>

46:59.101 --> 47:01.170
<b>each of you</b>
<b>needs to decide</b>

47:01.270 --> 47:05.073
<b>which of the bottom three</b>
<b>you'll eliminate</b>

47:05.174 --> 47:06.909
<b>if you win the lip sync.</b>

47:07.009 --> 47:11.013
<b>So while you queens deliberate</b>
<b>in the workroom,</b>

47:11.113 --> 47:15.584
<b>the judges and I will be</b>
<b>twisting balloon animals.</b>

47:16.785 --> 47:18.554
<b>You may leave the stage.</b>

47:18.687 --> 47:20.422
<b>- Coming up...</b>

47:20.522 --> 47:22.591
<b>- I did not see this coming.</b>

47:22.691 --> 47:23.926
<b>- Girl...</b>

47:24.026 --> 47:25.928
<b>- I just don't think</b>
<b>it's my time to go.</b>

47:26.028 --> 47:29.565
<b>- Every week is just like...</b>
<b>[ imitates bomb dropping ]</b>

47:29.698 --> 47:31.133
<b>turd city.</b>

47:31.233 --> 47:32.501
<b>- I know what I have to do.</b>

47:32.601 --> 47:35.404
<b>[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]</b>

47:39.651 --> 47:41.553
<b>- Lord. Lord.</b>

47:41.653 --> 47:43.221
<b>- A cocktail, please, Jesus.</b>

47:43.321 --> 47:45.890
<b>- I've never been an alcoholic,</b>
<b>but today I'm going in.</b>

47:45.990 --> 47:47.225
<b>- Oh, I'm full on.</b>

47:47.325 --> 47:48.727
<b>If I could black out</b>
<b>right now, I would.</b>

47:48.827 --> 47:51.730
<b>Well, here we are again</b>
<b>with another elimination,</b>

47:51.830 --> 47:54.666
<b>and it's always</b>
<b>a difficult decision.</b>

47:54.766 --> 47:57.902
<b>I can attest to that</b>
<b>more than anyone.</b>

47:58.002 --> 48:00.338
<b>- I thought I would win,</b>
<b>but that's okay.</b>

48:00.438 --> 48:01.740
<b>- You thought</b>
<b>you were gonna win?</b>

48:01.840 --> 48:03.108
<b>- I did. I thought</b>
<b>I would be in the top,</b>

48:03.208 --> 48:04.776
<b>and I was ready to do</b>
<b>my little lip sync,</b>

48:04.876 --> 48:06.678
<b>do my little song,</b>
<b>but I'll get, you know.</b>

48:06.778 --> 48:08.613
<b>I thought</b>
<b>I would be in the top,</b>

48:08.713 --> 48:12.250
<b>so I'm kind of trying to</b>
<b>wrap my head around that.</b>

48:12.350 --> 48:13.618
<b>I'm not gonna be safe</b>
<b>and cry</b>

48:13.718 --> 48:15.286
<b>because that would be,</b>
<b>you know, inappropriate, but...</b>

48:15.387 --> 48:16.921
<b>- [ laughs ]</b>

48:17.022 --> 48:19.224
<b>- Kennedy,</b>
<b>the full redemption, sis.</b>

48:19.324 --> 48:20.658
<b>- Yes, ma'am.</b>
<b>- Cheers.</b>

48:20.759 --> 48:22.227
<b>- Cheers.</b>
<b>- Cheers.</b>

48:22.327 --> 48:24.129
<b>- Ben, you're also</b>
<b>in the top two.</b>

48:24.229 --> 48:26.231
<b>- Ben has won every single</b>
<b>challenge since we got here.</b>

48:26.331 --> 48:27.232
<b>- She going home next week.</b>

48:27.332 --> 48:28.800
<b>[ all laugh ]</b>

48:28.900 --> 48:30.201
<b>- Milk,</b>
<b>you seem really quiet.</b>

48:30.301 --> 48:31.236
<b>What's going through</b>
<b>your head?</b>

48:31.336 --> 48:32.871
<b>- I'm crying about--</b>

48:32.971 --> 48:34.806
<b>now I'm crying</b>
<b>for a legit reason,</b>

48:34.906 --> 48:40.311
<b>being in the bottom, but I did</b>
<b>not see this coming at all.</b>

48:41.413 --> 48:42.681
<b>- Girl...</b>

48:42.781 --> 48:45.050
<b>I think, like, Milk</b>
<b>in a weird way,</b>

48:45.150 --> 48:47.719
<b>she works</b>
<b>so much in her mind,</b>

48:47.819 --> 48:49.954
<b>almost like you convince</b>
<b>yourself of something</b>

<b>even if</b>
<b>it's not the reality.</b>

48:51.923 --> 48:53.925
<b>I don't know,</b>
<b>maybe that's how she copes.</b>

48:53.958 --> 48:55.827
<b>I mean, that performance,</b>

48:55.927 --> 48:57.729
<b>it's, like,</b>
<b>how can you not tell?</b>

48:57.829 --> 49:02.434
<b>- I'm being penalized</b>
<b>for going 100% full throttle,</b>

49:02.534 --> 49:06.805
<b>and I don't 100% agree</b>
<b>with the critiques.</b>

49:06.938 --> 49:11.076
<b>I thought Trixie and I had</b>
<b>an amazing back and forth.</b>

49:11.176 --> 49:13.178
<b>I really thought</b>
<b>I killed that challenge.</b>

49:13.278 --> 49:16.081
<b>- I don't know</b>
<b>how she's this delusional.</b>

49:16.181 --> 49:18.650
<b>How--somebody put something</b>
<b>in her cocktail.</b>

49:18.750 --> 49:21.453
<b>Cosby? [ laughs ]</b>

<b>- My question</b>
<b>to the top two,</b>

49:23.722 --> 49:26.391
<b>we have three now</b>
<b>in the bottom.</b>

49:26.491 --> 49:27.859
<b>That's the gag</b>
<b>of the season.</b>

49:27.959 --> 49:30.395
<b>- They did it</b>
<b>last season, too.</b>

49:30.495 --> 49:31.863
<b>- Well, to me this is a gag.</b>

49:31.963 --> 49:33.431
<b>[ all laugh ]</b>

49:33.531 --> 49:35.166
<b>How are you going to assess</b>
<b>the situation?</b>

49:35.266 --> 49:36.201
<b>The two of you, are you guys</b>

49:36.301 --> 49:38.570
<b>gonna do one on ones</b>
<b>with the girls?</b>

49:38.670 --> 49:40.672
<b>- I decided not to.</b>

49:44.008 --> 49:46.644
<b>I'm just gonna do what I've said</b>
<b>from the beginning,</b>

49:46.745 --> 49:49.547
<b>and that's just</b>
<b>assess the whole thing.</b>

49:49.647 --> 49:50.749
<b>- Right.</b>

49:50.915 --> 49:52.550
<b>- And just make my own</b>
<b>professional decision.</b>

49:52.650 --> 49:56.221
<b>I do feel like</b>
<b>playing a fair game,</b>

49:56.321 --> 49:58.590
<b>and y'all already been crying</b>
<b>and [ bleep ].</b>

49:58.690 --> 50:01.793
<b>- That sort of</b>
<b>comes as a shock.</b>

50:01.926 --> 50:03.528
<b>Is it 'cause she's</b>
<b>already made up her mind?</b>

50:03.628 --> 50:06.097
<b>Is it 'cause</b>
<b>she doesn't want to allude</b>

50:06.197 --> 50:08.600
<b>to what she's about to do?</b>

50:08.700 --> 50:10.668
<b>I mean, it doesn't scare me</b>

50:10.769 --> 50:15.306
<b>because she's a smart individual</b>
<b>who sees it as a whole.</b>

50:16.307 --> 50:18.943
<b>- M'lady, how you feeling?</b>

50:18.977 --> 50:21.179
<b>- You know, it doesn't</b>
<b>feel great to be in the bottom,</b>

50:21.279 --> 50:23.181
<b>but I feel like I've been doing</b>
<b>well in the competition so far,</b>

50:23.281 --> 50:25.717
<b>so I feel like this is</b>
<b>just, like, a minor slip,</b>

50:25.817 --> 50:27.052
<b>and it happens.</b>

50:27.152 --> 50:28.853
<b>- Yeah. I mean, I think</b>
<b>you've been phenomenal.</b>

50:28.953 --> 50:30.622
<b>- I just don't think</b>
<b>it's my time to go.</b>

50:30.722 --> 50:34.559
<b>I think DeLa is going</b>
<b>to judge the bottom three</b>

50:34.659 --> 50:35.894
<b>based on our track records.</b>

50:35.994 --> 50:38.563
<b>So I know I'm safe because</b>
<b>I won the first challenge.</b>

50:38.663 --> 50:40.999
<b>Milk has been safe</b>
<b>the whole time,</b>

50:41.099 --> 50:43.802
<b>but Chi Chi has been</b>
<b>statistically doing the worst</b>

50:43.902 --> 50:45.303
<b>every single week.</b>

50:45.403 --> 50:46.805
<b>I mean, you put it together.</b>

50:46.905 --> 50:49.407
<b>- When I got here,</b>
<b>I thought I had this in the bag,</b>

50:49.507 --> 50:50.775
<b>you know what I mean?</b>

50:50.909 --> 50:54.079
<b>Like, ain't none of these</b>
<b>bitches gonna to upstage me,</b>

50:54.179 --> 50:55.180
<b>you know what I mean?</b>

50:55.280 --> 50:57.248
<b>Like, I got these looks</b>
<b>together, baby.</b>

50:57.349 --> 50:59.084
<b>I'm going back in this thing,</b>
<b>you know what I mean?</b>

50:59.184 --> 51:03.922
<b>And every week is just like...</b>
<b>[ imitates bomb dropping ]</b>

51:03.988 --> 51:05.223
<b>turd city.</b>

51:05.323 --> 51:08.793
<b>I let this challenge,</b>
<b>like, diminish my spark</b>

51:08.927 --> 51:12.664
<b>and question myself</b>
<b>whether I can do this or not.</b>

51:12.764 --> 51:15.467
<b>I know [bleep ] bring me down,</b>
<b>you know what I mean?</b>

51:15.567 --> 51:16.601
<b>- But it happens</b>
<b>to all of us.</b>

51:16.701 --> 51:18.303
<b>You just gotta--</b>
<b>it's how quickly</b>

51:18.403 --> 51:19.604
<b>you can turn it around</b>
<b>and get back up.</b>

51:19.704 --> 51:22.774
<b>- I've been in the bottom</b>
<b>three times,</b>

51:22.941 --> 51:25.577
<b>and I'm beginning</b>
<b>to question</b>

51:25.677 --> 51:27.946
<b>is this</b>
<b>the right time for me?</b>

51:28.012 --> 51:30.215
<b>Maybe I should have</b>
<b>been on All Stars 4,</b>

51:30.315 --> 51:31.383
<b>you know what I mean?</b>

51:31.483 --> 51:33.418
<b>Or maybe I should have</b>
<b>popped out of a box</b>

51:33.518 --> 51:35.086
<b>like Shangela on Season 10.</b>

51:35.186 --> 51:38.757
<b>I don't think I'm ready</b>
<b>to be here at All Stars.</b>

51:38.890 --> 51:41.659
<b>- Hi, Chi Chi.</b>
<b>How you feeling?</b>

51:41.760 --> 51:44.062
<b>- Girl, I mean--</b>

51:44.162 --> 51:45.063
<b>- Here we are again.</b>

51:45.163 --> 51:46.398
<b>- Here we go again,</b>
<b>you know,</b>

51:46.498 --> 51:48.400
<b>and, like, I don't know.</b>

51:48.500 --> 51:50.902
<b>I don't know if I have</b>
<b>what it takes to go all the way.</b>

51:51.002 --> 51:52.037
<b>- Yeah.</b>

51:52.137 --> 51:53.938
<b>- And I hate to say that,</b>
<b>you know.</b>

51:54.039 --> 51:56.474
<b>I want to be here just as bad</b>
<b>as everybody else does.</b>

51:56.574 --> 51:58.009
<b>- Yeah.</b>

51:58.109 --> 52:00.245
<b>- But I'm so friggin'</b>
<b>intimidated right now.</b>

52:00.345 --> 52:04.916
<b>I feel like the life</b>
<b>has been sucked out of Chi Chi,</b>

52:04.949 --> 52:08.353
<b>and, like, me personally,</b>
<b>I don't care what they say,</b>

52:08.453 --> 52:09.921
<b>don't say this</b>
<b>and don't say that,</b>

52:10.021 --> 52:12.924
<b>but to me, the right decision</b>
<b>is to be fair,</b>

52:12.991 --> 52:14.626
<b>you know what I mean?</b>

52:14.726 --> 52:19.297
<b>- The reality is</b>
<b>that the only thing</b>

52:19.397 --> 52:22.934
<b>that dampens</b>
<b>your confidence is--</b>

52:23.001 --> 52:25.537
<b>- Accepting what</b>
<b>somebody else is saying.</b>

52:25.637 --> 52:27.005
<b>- Exactly.</b>
<b>- [ sighs ]</b>

52:29.941 --> 52:31.743
<b>Just make</b>
<b>the right decision.</b>

52:33.411 --> 52:36.981
<b>- Deciding who to send home</b>
<b>is always super hard.</b>

52:37.082 --> 52:39.918
<b>No matter what anybody says</b>

52:40.018 --> 52:43.021
<b>about whether they're ready</b>
<b>for their time to go,</b>

52:43.121 --> 52:45.990
<b>there's nobody who didn't</b>
<b>fight very hard to be here</b>

52:46.091 --> 52:47.359
<b>and doesn't</b>
<b>continue to fight</b>

52:47.459 --> 52:48.893
<b>once they walk through</b>
<b>that door.</b>

52:48.960 --> 52:51.663
<b>- Big and Milky.</b>

52:51.763 --> 52:53.231
<b>- Fire me up.</b>

52:53.331 --> 52:55.633
<b>- Well, the thing is,</b>
<b>I'd like to be very honest</b>

52:55.734 --> 52:57.202
<b>about the whole</b>
<b>situation, guys.</b>

52:57.302 --> 53:00.905
<b>Like, everybody just trying</b>
<b>to be so, like, sugar coat,</b>

53:00.972 --> 53:02.474
<b>coo coo coo,</b>
<b>woo woo woo woo woo.</b>

53:02.574 --> 53:05.477
<b>Milk is saying, like, I thought</b>
<b>I was going to be in the top.</b>

53:05.577 --> 53:08.246
<b>To me,</b>
<b>I thought that the top</b>

53:08.346 --> 53:10.215
<b>was going to be</b>
<b>you and Kennedy.</b>

53:10.315 --> 53:11.449
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

53:11.549 --> 53:12.617
<b>- But you are</b>
<b>the fakest bitch alive.</b>

53:12.717 --> 53:13.785
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- And to be fair,</b>

53:13.918 --> 53:15.920
<b>you probably would have</b>
<b>been in the top two</b>

53:16.021 --> 53:17.689
<b>had you been able</b>
<b>to land all the things</b>

53:17.789 --> 53:19.057
<b>that you were looking</b>
<b>to land.</b>

53:19.157 --> 53:20.525
<b>- Right.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

53:20.625 --> 53:21.659
<b>It was so hard, you guys,</b>
<b>because he was just--</b>

53:21.760 --> 53:23.695
<b>he was, like,</b>
<b>yelling the whole time.</b>

53:23.795 --> 53:25.030
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- He's, like, big</b>

53:25.130 --> 53:28.066
<b>and I'm like, ba da ba da.</b>
<b>It doesn't, like--</b>

53:28.166 --> 53:29.701
<b>And I could feel you guys'</b>
<b>energy in the moment.</b>

53:29.801 --> 53:32.270
<b>I was, like, [ bleep ].</b>

53:32.370 --> 53:33.805
<b>- How are you?</b>

53:33.938 --> 53:35.240
<b>- I'm in the bottom three.</b>

53:35.340 --> 53:38.043
<b>Like, what the [ bleep ]?</b>

53:38.143 --> 53:39.210
<b>- Yeah.</b>

53:39.310 --> 53:40.578
<b>- It's--I don't know.</b>

53:40.678 --> 53:43.181
<b>It's a [ bleep, bleep ]</b>
<b>situation.</b>

53:43.281 --> 53:44.516
<b>To be in the bottom three</b>

53:44.616 --> 53:48.620
<b>with two queens</b>
<b>that didn't give a 100%,</b>

53:48.720 --> 53:51.356
<b>that were bulldozed</b>
<b>by their scene partner,</b>

53:51.456 --> 53:52.524
<b>and then there's me.</b>

53:52.624 --> 53:54.993
<b>I haven't made sense</b>
<b>of it all yet.</b>

53:55.093 --> 53:57.062
<b>Obviously</b>
<b>this isn't my thing.</b>

53:57.162 --> 53:59.431
<b>I'm not super into comedy,</b>

53:59.531 --> 54:02.033
<b>and so I thought</b>
<b>that being that way</b>

54:02.133 --> 54:04.069
<b>and succeeding in a way,</b>

54:04.169 --> 54:06.638
<b>that it would be, like,</b>
<b>wow, Milk, you did it.</b>

54:06.738 --> 54:08.206
<b>Just know</b>
<b>that I want to be here,</b>

54:08.306 --> 54:09.908
<b>know that</b>
<b>I want to continue.</b>

54:10.008 --> 54:14.813
<b>The judges actually want me to</b>
<b>continue in this competition.</b>

54:14.913 --> 54:19.918
<b>The other queens respect me</b>
<b>and they want me to be here.</b>

54:20.018 --> 54:24.456
<b>I am not on the level</b>
<b>of these bottom queens,</b>

54:24.556 --> 54:28.259
<b>and to be compared to them,</b>
<b>it pisses me off.</b>

54:28.360 --> 54:31.429
<b>But I'm feeling confident.</b>

54:31.529 --> 54:32.630
<b>Make good decisions.</b>

54:32.731 --> 54:34.733
<b>- Nope.</b>
<b>Never have, never will.</b>

54:36.434 --> 54:38.636
<b>- Oh, my God,</b>
<b>this is so much fun.</b>

54:38.737 --> 54:40.305
<b>- Oh, my God, I love it.</b>

54:40.405 --> 54:42.774
<b>I made a dog.</b>
<b>- [ laughs ]</b>

54:42.874 --> 54:44.909
<b>- I got lip and I got lips.</b>

54:45.009 --> 54:47.178
<b>- Oh, wow,</b>
<b>that is hilarious.</b>

54:47.278 --> 54:51.016
<b>- [ normal voice ]</b>
<b>Whee, this is so fun.</b>

54:51.116 --> 54:53.551
<b>- I didn't know the balloons</b>
<b>had helium in them.</b>

54:53.651 --> 54:55.353
<b>- They don't.</b>

54:57.956 --> 54:59.657
<b>- Well, that's awkward.</b>

54:59.758 --> 55:01.559
<b>Silence.</b>

55:01.659 --> 55:02.894
<b>[ pop ] Oh.</b>

55:02.961 --> 55:04.896
<b>- Bring back my All Stars.</b>

55:10.435 --> 55:14.639
<b>- Having to eliminate somebody</b>
<b>is not a good feeling,</b>

55:14.739 --> 55:16.941
<b>but this</b>
<b>is part of the game.</b>

55:17.042 --> 55:19.377
<b>I look at the whole picture.</b>

55:19.477 --> 55:21.780
<b>I just don't look at</b>
<b>the performance</b>

55:21.913 --> 55:23.815
<b>or just</b>
<b>what the judge's say.</b>

55:23.915 --> 55:26.184
<b>You gotta take everything</b>
<b>into account,</b>

55:26.284 --> 55:28.086
<b>so I know what I have to do.</b>

55:29.788 --> 55:32.624
<b>- Tonight the decision</b>
<b>is between three people,</b>

55:32.724 --> 55:36.261
<b>and that just</b>
<b>complicates things more.</b>

55:36.361 --> 55:41.499
<b>There are reasons</b>
<b>that every girl has to stay</b>

55:41.599 --> 55:44.469
<b>and there are ways</b>
<b>in which every girl</b>

55:44.569 --> 55:47.439
<b>didn't show up for</b>
<b>the competition this week.</b>

55:50.508 --> 55:52.577
<b>[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]</b>

55:58.192 --> 55:59.260
<b>- Welcome back, ladies.</b>

55:59.360 --> 56:03.631
<b>Two top All Stars</b>
<b>stand before me.</b>

56:03.731 --> 56:06.333
<b>Ladies, this is your chance</b>
<b>to impress me,</b>

<b>win $10,000</b>
<b>and earn the power</b>

<b>to give one of the bottom queens</b>
<b>the chop.</b>

<b>The time has come...</b>
<b>[ thunder ]</b>

56:21.215 --> 56:23.851
<b>[ echoing ]</b>
<b>for your legacy.</b>

56:25.352 --> 56:27.054
<b>- I know that</b>
<b>I shouldn't camp this one up</b>

56:27.154 --> 56:29.123
<b>because I need</b>
<b>to show the judges</b>

56:29.223 --> 56:30.991
<b>that I can do</b>
<b>different things.</b>

56:31.091 --> 56:35.095
<b>This is my third lip sync,</b>
<b>and if I don't win this one,</b>

56:35.196 --> 56:38.999
<b>then I'm at a negative</b>
<b>two to one ratio.</b>

56:39.099 --> 56:43.837

<b>I've made my decision.</b>

58:51.265 --> 58:53.667
<b>Kennedy Davenport...</b>

58:53.767 --> 58:54.969
<b>you're a winner, baby.</b>

58:55.069 --> 58:56.637
<b>- Whoo!</b>

58:56.737 --> 58:58.806
<b>- Whoo-hoo!</b>

58:58.906 --> 59:00.741
<b>- Con-drag-ulations.</b>

59:00.841 --> 59:04.612
<b>You've earned a cash tip</b>
<b>of $10,000.</b>

59:04.712 --> 59:05.613
<b>- Thank you.</b>

59:05.713 --> 59:08.249
<b>- BenDeLaCreme,</b>
<b>you are safe.</b>

59:08.349 --> 59:11.085
<b>[ applause ]</b>
<b>- Good job, Ben.</b>

59:13.787 --> 59:17.157
<b>- Will the bottom three</b>
<b>please step forward?</b>

59:22.229 --> 59:27.401
<b>Kennedy, with great power</b>
<b>comes great responsibility.</b>

59:27.501 --> 59:32.606
<b>Which queen have you chosen</b>
<b>to get the chop?</b>

59:32.706 --> 59:35.609
<b>- Oh. It was very hard.</b>

59:35.709 --> 59:40.614
<b>I had to really think about</b>
<b>everything that was going on</b>

59:40.714 --> 59:43.884
<b>on and off screen</b>
<b>to make my decision,</b>

59:43.984 --> 59:48.522
<b>and I take that wholeheartedly</b>
<b>as a professional.</b>

59:48.622 --> 59:50.991
<b>So I chose...</b>

59:53.327 --> 59:54.862
<b>Milk.</b>

59:57.798 --> 1:00:02.102
<b>- Milk, as it is written,</b>
<b>so it shall be done.</b>

1:00:02.203 --> 1:00:06.640
<b>You are and will always be</b>
<b>an All Star.</b>

1:00:06.740 --> 1:00:10.211
<b>Now sashay away.</b>

1:00:17.952 --> 1:00:20.921
<b>- Thank you so much</b>
<b>for bringing me back.</b>

1:00:21.088 --> 1:00:22.656
<b>I will continue</b>
<b>to make you proud.</b>

1:00:22.756 --> 1:00:26.727
<b>I will do things that</b>
<b>nobody else has ever done.</b>

1:00:26.827 --> 1:00:29.563
<b>[ applause ]</b>

1:00:31.298 --> 1:00:34.435
<b>At this point in the game,</b>
<b>me holding this...</b>

1:00:36.237 --> 1:00:37.705
<b>It's stupid.</b>

1:00:37.805 --> 1:00:39.273
<b>The fact</b>
<b>that I was eliminated</b>

1:00:39.373 --> 1:00:40.441
<b>even though another queen</b>

1:00:40.541 --> 1:00:42.877
<b>had been in the bottom</b>
<b>three times...</b>

1:00:42.977 --> 1:00:43.944
<b>dumb.</b>

1:00:44.111 --> 1:00:45.312
<b>I know a lot of girls</b>

1:00:45.412 --> 1:00:49.016
<b>think it's unfair for</b>
<b>them to be going home, but...</b>

1:00:50.517 --> 1:00:51.652
<b>[ sighs ]</b>

1:00:51.752 --> 1:00:55.256
<b>I just don't see</b>
<b>how this was my week.</b>

1:00:55.356 --> 1:00:57.258

<b>Wagon Wheel Watusi.</b>

1:01:09.303 --> 1:01:11.171
<b>- What does that mean?</b>

1:01:11.272 --> 1:01:13.140
<b>Is somebody gonna tell me?</b>

1:01:16.911 --> 1:01:18.746
<b>Damn it.</b>
<b>[ chuckles ]</b>

<b>Look who's here!</b>

1:01:29.690 --> 1:01:30.791
<b>- Hi, guys.</b>

1:01:30.891 --> 1:01:32.025
<b>[ cheering ]</b>

1:01:32.125 --> 1:01:33.794
<b>It's Marc Jacobs.</b>

1:01:33.894 --> 1:01:36.897
<b>- You look like a fudgsicle</b>
<b>dipped in flowers.</b>

1:01:36.997 --> 1:01:40.000
<b>- You and I will meet</b>
<b>in a back alley somewhere.</b>

1:01:40.100 --> 1:01:43.203
<b>- Oh, face crack.</b>

1:01:43.303 --> 1:01:45.439
<b>- Well, can I trust you,</b>
<b>bitch?</b>

1:01:45.539 --> 1:01:48.141
