00:02.800 --> 00:05.200
-* One, two,
one, two, three, four *

00:05.233 --> 00:07.267
* Ooh

00:07.300 --> 00:10.400
* Yeah, I'll be fine, yeah

00:10.433 --> 00:12.400
* Ooh

00:12.433 --> 00:14.200
* Oh yeah, here

00:14.233 --> 00:18.433
* Oh, the good Lord knows it,
oh, the good Lord knows it *

00:18.467 --> 00:19.533
* Ooh

00:19.567 --> 00:20.700
* I left better behind

00:20.733 --> 00:23.333
* To be fine

00:23.367 --> 00:24.467
* Yeah, yeah

00:24.500 --> 00:27.600
* Make my mama turn
another blind eye *

00:27.633 --> 00:29.533
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

00:29.567 --> 00:32.200
* I left better behind
to be fine *

00:34.367 --> 00:35.667
-Oh, what are you doing?

00:35.700 --> 00:38.100
-Gnawing on your face.
-Why?

00:38.133 --> 00:41.200
-It's Christmas, and I wanted
to gnaw on my boyfriend's face.

00:42.667 --> 00:45.500
-John used to do this,
but now he's too old.

00:45.533 --> 00:48.533
-Okay. Um, gnaw on my face.

00:48.567 --> 00:50.367
-Yeah?

00:50.400 --> 00:52.200
Mm.

00:52.233 --> 00:53.600
-It's good, yeah?

00:53.633 --> 00:56.167
-Mm. It's all right.

00:57.567 --> 01:00.100
What can I do to make
today less shit for you?

01:00.133 --> 01:01.200
-Love me.

01:01.233 --> 01:04.100
-Yeah? Done. Nailed it.

01:04.133 --> 01:06.633
-Have you ever seen a vagina
as out as mine?

01:09.400 --> 01:11.033
-Pardon?

01:11.067 --> 01:12.200
-Well...

01:12.233 --> 01:15.167
I've watched porn,
and there are never
any outies.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.300
Mine is so out.

01:17.333 --> 01:18.333
-It's not that out.

01:18.367 --> 01:20.667
-Fuck you.
It is out.

01:20.700 --> 01:22.333
It's really out.

01:22.367 --> 01:25.400
-Well, I really,
really like your vagina

01:25.433 --> 01:26.700
and all of its work.

01:26.733 --> 01:29.233
-I'm not saying
it's a bad thing.

01:29.267 --> 01:30.367
I like outie vaginas.

01:30.400 --> 01:31.533
They're really friendly.

01:31.567 --> 01:33.767
They're like,
"Hey, how's it goin'?"

01:33.800 --> 01:35.467
-(both chuckle)

01:35.500 --> 01:39.467
-Well, I think you have
a beautiful vagina.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.333
-Does Claire have an outie?

01:43.200 --> 01:45.267
-Well, this feels like a trap.

01:45.300 --> 01:47.800
-Hey, hey, take a look
at this pimple for me.

01:51.167 --> 01:52.500
-Ooh.
-This one.

01:52.533 --> 01:54.833
Do you think I should pop it?

01:54.867 --> 01:56.067
-Mm, what do
you think, Gracie?

01:56.100 --> 01:58.667
Should she pop it
or should she leave it
till tomorrow?

01:58.700 --> 01:59.700
Tomorrow.

01:59.733 --> 02:02.400
-Cool. I try tomorrow.

02:04.300 --> 02:06.167
-Hurry up, ya bastards!

02:06.200 --> 02:08.700
Oh, Hannah, we're
gonna be late now!

02:08.733 --> 02:11.367
-Hannah:
(grunts)
Fuck!

02:14.267 --> 02:16.233
Fuck!
(grunts)

02:16.267 --> 02:17.800
-* Hark the herald--

02:17.833 --> 02:19.500
Christ! Fuck!

02:19.533 --> 02:21.800
-Oh, no.
-Oh!

02:21.833 --> 02:24.433
S-- Oh, I should
have knocked. I'm sorry.

02:24.467 --> 02:26.800
-Yeah, everything would
be great if you'd knocked.

02:26.833 --> 02:28.133
-Oh...

02:28.167 --> 02:30.400
Well, uh, are you okay?

02:31.733 --> 02:34.133
-Think we're beyond
that question now.

02:34.167 --> 02:35.700
-Do you still want
to do Christmas?

02:35.733 --> 02:37.800
-Might as well.

02:39.367 --> 02:40.733
-We'll talk about this later.

02:40.767 --> 02:42.067
-Yeah.

02:42.100 --> 02:44.367
Between mains and dessert?

02:45.733 --> 02:46.800
(sighs)

02:46.833 --> 02:48.167
-(knocking)
-Rose: Hello!

02:48.200 --> 02:49.400
It's Santa!
-(Christmas music plays)

02:49.433 --> 02:51.267
No, I'm just kidding!
It's Mum and Hannah.

02:51.300 --> 02:52.533
-Hello. Yes,
please go sit.
-Hi!

02:52.567 --> 02:54.833
-Hi!
-Oh, now, sorry we're late.
It's not Hannah's fault.

02:54.867 --> 02:56.100
-Okay.
-Merry Christmas.

02:56.133 --> 02:57.067
-And I made my shortbread.

02:57.100 --> 02:59.433
It just isn't Christmas
without my shortbread!

02:59.467 --> 03:00.533
-That's just not true.

03:00.567 --> 03:03.400
-Rose: Hi! I made my shortbread!
-All: Hi, Rose! Hi!

03:03.433 --> 03:05.700
It isn't Christmas
without my shortbread!

03:05.733 --> 03:06.767
Here you go, Alan.
-Oh, yum.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.033
Yes, please.
-Good.

03:08.067 --> 03:09.467
-Hi, I'm Ella.
-Hi!

03:09.500 --> 03:10.733
-This is, uh...
-Mae?

03:10.767 --> 03:13.700
-Oh, no thanks.
-Oh, Mae-- Mae,
have-- have some shortbread.

03:13.733 --> 03:15.600
-Oh! Uh, okay.

03:15.633 --> 03:18.500
I'm going to go try to convince
Grace to go to sleep.
-Oh, okay.

03:18.533 --> 03:20.400
-Can I have a piece
of shortbread?
-Oh, yeah.

03:20.433 --> 03:21.733
-Thank you.

03:21.767 --> 03:22.900
-Hello!

03:22.933 --> 03:24.133
-* And pretend that
he's a circus clown *

03:24.167 --> 03:28.033
* We'll have lots of fun
with Mr. Snowman *

03:28.067 --> 03:29.700
-Come on, Gracie.
-I dropped the gravy.

03:29.733 --> 03:31.733
-Yep.
-(sighs)

03:31.767 --> 03:35.267
Does-- does your family
like gravy?

03:35.300 --> 03:36.400
-Yeah.

03:36.433 --> 03:37.767
What you're gonna do is

03:37.800 --> 03:39.267
you're gonna take
these paper towels

03:39.300 --> 03:40.467
and you're gonna
clean up the gravy,

03:40.500 --> 03:41.800
and we're just
never gonna tell anyone

03:41.833 --> 03:43.600
that there was ever
any gravy, all right?

03:43.633 --> 03:46.267
Christmas really lost its sheen

03:46.300 --> 03:48.433
once I started being able
to afford my own toys.

03:48.467 --> 03:51.633
-All singing along:
* Gone away is the bluebird

03:51.667 --> 03:55.600
* Here to stay,
is the new bird *

03:55.633 --> 03:57.733
* It sings a love song

03:57.767 --> 04:01.567
* As we go along,
walking in a winter wonderland *

04:01.600 --> 04:04.133
-Beans! Beans!
-Oh, my God.

04:04.167 --> 04:05.667
-Mae:
Gracie's down.

04:05.700 --> 04:07.833
I hope she's asleep
for a long time.

04:07.867 --> 04:10.500
I hope till she's 18.

04:10.533 --> 04:12.700
-(laughs)
18!

04:12.733 --> 04:14.767
-Got any ice, Josh?
The punch is warm.

04:14.800 --> 04:17.267
-Tom?
-I forgot to get ice.

04:17.300 --> 04:19.300
-(all groan)
-Um, everyone eat please.
It's going cold.

04:19.333 --> 04:21.200
-Rose:
No, no, no! Hey! No!
Just not before

04:21.233 --> 04:22.300
the crackers, you idiot!

04:22.333 --> 04:23.567
We've got to do
the crackers first!

04:23.600 --> 04:25.467
-Yeah, you idiot.
-Lame idiot.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.133
-Yeah. You look
like Ellen DeGeneres

04:27.167 --> 04:28.667
if Ellen DeGeneres was a candle.

04:28.700 --> 04:30.400
-Oh!
-I think you're okay.

04:30.433 --> 04:31.533
-Thanks.

04:31.567 --> 04:34.033
-(crack)
-Mae: Oh, don't hold
so much of it! Just...

04:34.067 --> 04:35.067
-Did I ever tell you
that I'm Jewish?

04:35.100 --> 04:37.767
This is properly thrilling.
-Rose: Here we go.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.167
-(pop)
-Oh, why didn't it bang?

04:40.200 --> 04:41.767
-I usually make them bang.
-What I need you to do is

04:41.800 --> 04:43.633
at some time today I need
you to take some shortbread,

04:43.667 --> 04:46.267
I need you to say, "Jeez, Rose,
this is delicious shortbread."
-Okay. Now?

04:46.300 --> 04:47.833
-(crack)
-No, not now.
It's too obvious.

04:47.867 --> 04:49.233
-Why do you keep cheating, huh?

04:49.267 --> 04:50.300
Why is this so important to you?

04:50.333 --> 04:51.233
-You're friggin' cheating!

04:51.267 --> 04:53.500
-Oh, hey, let's not
talk about cheating!

04:54.833 --> 04:56.200
Oh! No!

04:56.233 --> 04:57.600
Stuart. I meant Stuart, Mae.

04:57.633 --> 04:59.100
Not you, not you.
Or Alan.

04:59.133 --> 05:00.433
You, for that matter.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.700
-Tom:
Why didn't you tell me
you were Jewish?

05:02.733 --> 05:04.833
-Ella: So that you'd
get me a gift.
-Guys!

05:04.867 --> 05:07.667
-Oh, no. Claire has no one
to do her cracker with.

05:07.700 --> 05:10.033
-Oh, maybe Claire has to
do it by herself.

05:10.067 --> 05:12.067
-I don't want to do it
by myself.
-I'll do it with you.

05:12.100 --> 05:13.600
-Claire: Okay.
-Josh: No, Dad!

05:13.633 --> 05:15.467
-She has to do it
by herself.
-Yeah.

05:15.500 --> 05:16.500
'Cause she has no partner.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.800
-Tom: No one in the world.
-'Cause she's alone.

05:18.833 --> 05:20.767
-Oh, maybe I won't do
the cracker then.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.367
-Oh, it's probably
because of that attitude

05:22.400 --> 05:23.600
that you don't have
anyone to do it with.

05:23.633 --> 05:26.700
-Josh, Christmas
is about charity.
You do it with her.

05:26.733 --> 05:28.267
Go on. Josh will
do it with you.
-Yeah, Josh.

05:28.300 --> 05:30.400
-Yes, I'll do
the pity cracker with Claire.

05:30.433 --> 05:31.633
-Thank you.
-(crack)

05:31.667 --> 05:33.767
-Oh, you fu...
-I won.

05:35.233 --> 05:37.533
-* Do, do, do, do, do

05:37.567 --> 05:39.433
* Ah

05:41.567 --> 05:44.533
-Oh, should I--
should I go get ice?
-Rose: No!

05:44.567 --> 05:46.133
Not now.
We just started eating.

05:46.167 --> 05:47.100
-There's red wine there.

05:48.267 --> 05:49.267
-Where's the gravy?

05:49.300 --> 05:52.100
-Oh. So guys...

05:52.133 --> 05:53.633
I forgot to make gravy.

05:53.667 --> 05:54.733
-(all gasp)

05:54.767 --> 05:58.400
-What?
-Joshua! Oh, what a shame.

05:58.433 --> 05:59.633
-Josh:
Yes, it is a tragedy.

05:59.667 --> 06:02.800
I agree and I'm very sorry,
but perhaps we can just forgive

06:02.833 --> 06:06.100
and forget on this--
this holiest of days, yep?

06:06.133 --> 06:08.233
-Mm. Great shortbread, Rose.

06:08.267 --> 06:09.100
-(squeals)

06:09.133 --> 06:11.400
-Alan:
Here you go.
Er, what-- uh...

06:11.433 --> 06:13.333
what did the zero say
to the eight?

06:13.367 --> 06:14.200
"Nice belt."

06:14.233 --> 06:15.300
-Ella:
I don't get it.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.600
-Mae: Okay...
-Alan: Oh.

06:16.633 --> 06:19.500
-Why did Santa's helper go
to the doctor?

06:19.533 --> 06:20.533
-All:
Huh?

06:20.567 --> 06:21.600
-Herpes!

06:21.633 --> 06:24.000
-(all laugh)

06:27.133 --> 06:29.600
-Telling me to eat
the shortbread was so harsh!

06:29.633 --> 06:31.167
-She loved it.
It was adorable.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.433
-No, she watched me eat
the whole thing

06:32.467 --> 06:34.333
like I was a cat
taking medicine.

06:34.367 --> 06:36.033
-Yeah.
-Tom: Hannah, where's your hat?

06:36.067 --> 06:38.133
-What?
-Why aren't you wearing
your hilarious hat?

06:38.167 --> 06:39.767
-Do you think you're too good
for your hat, Hannah?

06:39.800 --> 06:42.667
-Oh, yeah!
Put your hat on, Hannah!

06:42.700 --> 06:44.133
King Hannah!

06:44.167 --> 06:45.567
(laughs)

06:45.600 --> 06:46.667
-She hasn't clocked
that I'm a girl?

06:46.700 --> 06:49.433
-It's Christmas.
You have to wear the hat.
-Yeah!

06:49.467 --> 06:51.233
-Claire's not wearing one.
-I don't have a hat.

06:51.267 --> 06:52.167
-Josh:
'Cause she lost.

06:52.200 --> 06:53.267
-Here. She can have mine.

06:53.300 --> 06:55.167
-I would really like to see you
in the hat, Hannah.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.433
-I'm not wearing
the fucking hat.

06:56.467 --> 06:58.567
-Rose:
Uh, okay, guys. Um...

06:58.600 --> 07:00.233
Hannah's been a bit
depressed lately,

07:00.267 --> 07:01.400
so just go easy, all right?

07:01.433 --> 07:02.533
-Fine, fine.

07:02.567 --> 07:04.467
-(mouthing)
Are you okay?

07:04.500 --> 07:06.667
-Tom:
I guess a novelty hat
on a depressed person

07:06.700 --> 07:08.700
would just highlight
how depressed they are.

07:08.733 --> 07:11.567
-Mm, like how it'd be weird
to see a depressed person
on a jet-ski.

07:11.600 --> 07:12.733
-Tom:
Mm.

07:14.767 --> 07:17.500
-Um, I think you'd look hot
on a jet-ski.

07:17.533 --> 07:18.467
-Who is that?

07:18.500 --> 07:19.633
-This is new.

07:19.667 --> 07:21.600
-Yes. I was, um,
wondering about that.

07:21.633 --> 07:23.400
-Josh:
It's vegetarian nut roast,
and it's for Arnold.

07:23.433 --> 07:25.367
-Nice of Josh to make it
for me, yeah?
-Yes.

07:25.400 --> 07:27.033
-Oh...

07:27.067 --> 07:28.800
oh...

07:28.833 --> 07:31.733
Tastes like
blended cardboard. Ugh!

07:31.767 --> 07:34.567
-Does it?
-Rose, just put some salt on it.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.433
-Ella:
Okay, what is the worst present

07:36.467 --> 07:38.267
that everyone's ever received?

07:38.300 --> 07:39.600
I'm gonna go first
because obviously

07:39.633 --> 07:40.733
I wanna say mine.

07:40.767 --> 07:42.367
That's why I asked the question.

07:42.400 --> 07:45.433
My dad once
gave me maths tutoring.

07:45.467 --> 07:47.600
-Cool.
-Alan: I bet he felt
as bad as the, um,

07:47.633 --> 07:50.133
the two wise men that brought
frankincense and myrrh

07:50.167 --> 07:51.533
when they saw
the other bloke brought gold.

07:51.567 --> 07:53.433
-(all chuckle)

07:55.200 --> 07:57.167
-Did you just make that joke up?

07:57.200 --> 07:58.267
-Yep.

07:58.300 --> 07:59.333
-No, you didn't.

07:59.367 --> 08:00.167
-I did.

08:00.200 --> 08:02.633
-I'm thinking of
taking up the flute.

08:02.667 --> 08:03.833
-Claire:
Oh, yeah?

08:03.867 --> 08:05.400
-'Cause I was, um,
I was really musical

08:05.433 --> 08:07.600
when I was young,
but I just wasn't pushed enough.

08:07.633 --> 08:08.733
-Right.

08:08.767 --> 08:11.233
Hannah, turkey?

08:11.267 --> 08:12.467
-Yeah, sure.

08:12.500 --> 08:14.333
-What's this?
What's that made out of?

08:14.367 --> 08:16.433
-It's cotton.
-Feels really nice.

08:16.467 --> 08:18.400
-Claire:
What about yours?

08:18.433 --> 08:20.367
-Oh, it's cotton too.
-Oh, high five!

08:20.400 --> 08:22.633
-(laughs)
-(Grace cries)

08:24.467 --> 08:25.633
-Mae:
Sorry. We are having a bit

08:25.667 --> 08:27.200
of trouble getting
her to sleep.

08:27.233 --> 08:29.833
Hopefully she will calm down.

08:29.867 --> 08:31.267
-Well, she sound
very distressed.

08:31.300 --> 08:32.800
-Yes, yes.
I-- I-- I know.

08:32.833 --> 08:35.333
I can hear her.
I know how she sounds.

08:35.367 --> 08:37.533
-(Gracie cries louder)
-Maybe I should go
and check on her.

08:37.567 --> 08:39.800
-No.

08:39.833 --> 08:42.167
I am not going to be
the mean parent.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.500
You bought me the book.

08:43.533 --> 08:44.667
You made me read the book.

08:44.700 --> 08:46.067
You agree
with what's in the book,

08:46.100 --> 08:49.200
so we have 11 minute
and 38 seconds, okay?

08:49.233 --> 08:51.200
Before we can check on her.
-It's Christmas, Mae.

08:51.233 --> 08:54.167
-But Grace doesn't have
a concept of Christmas,
does she?

08:54.200 --> 08:56.300
I will not be the bad guy!

08:56.333 --> 08:58.133
-All right.
-She-- she will stop crying.

08:58.167 --> 08:59.367
-All right.

08:59.400 --> 09:01.300
-Mae, I think you're doing
a really good job.

09:01.333 --> 09:02.800
-Thank you, Claire.

09:02.833 --> 09:05.433
-We didn't have to do
this with Josh.
-Mae: Please...

09:05.467 --> 09:09.167
Rose, I have
this under control.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.233
-Maybe I could just
sneak in there and have
a little nibble.

09:11.267 --> 09:12.567
-Mae: Josh, please.
-(Rose laughs)

09:12.600 --> 09:13.800
-She's fine.

09:13.833 --> 09:15.567
-Josh:
No, no. I'm not worried
about her. I just wanna...

09:15.600 --> 09:17.800
go in there and have
a little nibble, you know?

09:17.833 --> 09:19.567
Just a little...
a little nibble.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.233
-Sorry,

09:21.267 --> 09:23.600
is no one going to make
a joke about Josh?

09:23.633 --> 09:26.367
-Yeah, how no parenting
techniques that are used on him

09:26.400 --> 09:28.600
should ever be used again?
-'Cause he's shit.

09:28.633 --> 09:30.533
-(all laugh)
-Big nostrils.

09:30.567 --> 09:31.733
-You?!

09:31.767 --> 09:32.967
-I'm trying to be
part of the family.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.633
-I don't think big nostrils are
a result of bad discipline.

09:35.667 --> 09:37.533
-(all laugh)
-Well, you wouldn't stop
picking your nose.

09:37.567 --> 09:38.700
-Oh, my mistake.

09:38.733 --> 09:41.033
-Alan:
Remember when we told Josh
that if he kept on

09:41.067 --> 09:42.567
picking his nose,
his nostrils would

09:42.600 --> 09:45.400
get huge and then
everybody would know
that he picked his nose?

09:45.433 --> 09:46.767
And I can't believe it's true.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.300
-(all laugh)

09:48.333 --> 09:49.267
-He went white.

09:49.300 --> 09:50.300
-Whiter than that?

09:50.333 --> 09:51.700
-Okay. All right.

09:51.733 --> 09:53.367
-I don't think
you can get whiter.

09:53.400 --> 09:54.167
-Translucent?

09:54.200 --> 09:55.767
-Yeah, you know what?
I'm happy.

09:55.800 --> 09:58.200
I'm happy to sacrifice myself
so we can all bond.

09:58.233 --> 09:59.667
-Whiter than going
to the farmers' market?

09:59.700 --> 10:00.733
-(all laugh)
-Mae: Oh, yeah! Oh!

10:00.767 --> 10:03.100
Whiter than
binge drinking, huh?
-(all laugh)

10:03.133 --> 10:05.833
-You're right, Josh.
He's not boring at all.

10:05.867 --> 10:07.300
-What?
-(Grace stops crying)

10:07.333 --> 10:10.433
-Oh, it worked.
She stop.

10:10.467 --> 10:11.567
-Alan:
Good job, honey.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.533
-Rose:
Yeah, today Grace learned
that just because

10:13.567 --> 10:15.500
she's upset doesn't mean
she deserves to be cared for.

10:15.533 --> 10:17.033
-Rose.

10:17.067 --> 10:18.633
That's uncalled for.

10:18.667 --> 10:22.067
It's unfair
and it's uncalled for.
-(chortles)

10:22.100 --> 10:24.667
All right, all right.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

10:24.700 --> 10:27.267
I-- Look, I regret saying it.
Look, I'm sorry, Mae.

10:30.567 --> 10:31.633
-Yeah.

10:31.667 --> 10:33.700
So Hannah, did you get
anything nice for Christmas?

10:33.733 --> 10:35.233
-No.

10:35.267 --> 10:36.467
-Brilliant.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.467
-Ella:
I'm sorry, I don't understand
what just happened.

10:38.500 --> 10:39.733
Why couldn't you go
check on her?

10:39.767 --> 10:41.433
-We're doing controlled crying.

10:41.467 --> 10:43.300
-Oh, right.

10:43.333 --> 10:45.533
I wouldn't be able
to do controlled crying.

10:45.567 --> 10:47.567
No offense, Mae.
I just wouldn't be up to do it.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.667
-Claire:
Why is this all being
directed at Mae?

10:49.700 --> 10:51.367
Alan agreed
not to check on her too.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.600
-Rose:
Everyone is forcing their kids

10:53.633 --> 10:55.467
to grow up too soon these days.

10:55.500 --> 10:58.067
-Mae:
I am not forcing her
to grow up!

10:58.100 --> 11:00.833
I am just making sure
that when she does grow up,

11:00.867 --> 11:02.233
she's not some
wingeing brat.

11:02.267 --> 11:03.667
No offense, Josh.

11:03.700 --> 11:05.333
-Some taken.

11:05.367 --> 11:06.733
-Is there any gravy, Josh?

11:06.767 --> 11:08.300
-No.

11:08.333 --> 11:11.267
Hannah, there's no gravy.
Did you not hear...

11:11.300 --> 11:13.467
No. Never mind.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.067
-Hannah, are you okay?

11:15.100 --> 11:16.100
-Yeah, I'm fine.

11:16.133 --> 11:17.633
-Ella:
I mean, for all we know,

11:17.667 --> 11:19.167
her crying could be baby talk

11:19.200 --> 11:20.767
for, "Help! There's
a snake in my bed!"

11:22.167 --> 11:24.167
-Yeah, maybe I'll just
pop my head in.

11:24.200 --> 11:25.233
-No, Alan.

11:25.267 --> 11:28.800
-What do you think, Tom?

11:28.833 --> 11:30.400
-I just wouldn't be bothered
checking on her.

11:30.433 --> 11:32.367
-No, that's not what you think.
-Josh: Yeah!

11:32.400 --> 11:33.733
What do you think, Tom?

11:33.767 --> 11:35.200
-Rose:
Yeah, Tom.

11:36.500 --> 11:37.800
-Um...

11:37.833 --> 11:40.100
I-- I think it's totally fine.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.833
I think it's really
responsible parenting, Mae.

11:41.867 --> 11:44.033
-Oh, yuck.
That was gross to watch.

11:44.067 --> 11:45.600
Never stand for anything
ever again, Tom.

11:45.633 --> 11:47.167
-I didn't want to!

11:47.200 --> 11:49.233
-I thought that maybe
that you'd agree with me
'cause I'm your girlfriend.

11:49.267 --> 11:50.500
-Okay, yeah.
I agree with Ella.

11:50.533 --> 11:51.600
-No, you don't.

11:51.633 --> 11:53.833
-I think-- I-- I--
Okay, I think

11:53.867 --> 11:55.367
whatever is easiest to think.

11:55.400 --> 11:58.200
I just said that before
to try and help Mae

11:58.233 --> 12:01.167
and lonely, poor Claire.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.767
-Alan:
Why does everybody
keep making jokes

12:02.800 --> 12:05.200
about Claire being lonely?

12:05.233 --> 12:07.767
You'd be knocking them back,
wouldn't you, Claire?

12:07.800 --> 12:08.733
A girl like you?

12:08.767 --> 12:10.467
-It's 'cause they've got
nothing else on me.

12:10.500 --> 12:11.600
-(chuckles)
-Dad.

12:11.633 --> 12:13.600
You're getting dangerously close
to flirting with Claire,

12:13.633 --> 12:15.767
and I just wanna...
intercept early, yeah?

12:15.800 --> 12:16.900
-Oh. Sorry.
-Yeah.

12:16.933 --> 12:20.667
-Yeah. Thank you, Josh.
-You've had heaps of boyfriends.

12:20.700 --> 12:21.767
-No!

12:21.800 --> 12:25.300
Um... I've had, like,
a few short-lived mistakes,

12:25.333 --> 12:26.567
and then there was Josh...

12:26.600 --> 12:27.600
-Boom.
-That doesn't count.

12:27.633 --> 12:28.667
-It counts as a mistake.

12:28.700 --> 12:30.233
-You made him gay.

12:30.267 --> 12:31.100
-Thank you, Claire.

12:31.133 --> 12:32.167
-Uh, there's Tom as well.

12:32.200 --> 12:35.033
Anybody? If you want to
say anything about Tom...

12:35.067 --> 12:36.833
-Fuck yeah. Achievement.
Ding, ding, ding.

12:36.867 --> 12:38.800
Didn't make me gay,
am I right?

12:38.833 --> 12:40.833
-Sorry, Ella.
-You can have him back
if you like.

12:40.867 --> 12:42.300
-At this point,
I'd probably consider it.

12:45.233 --> 12:46.367
-Don't say that.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.033
-Why would you say that?

12:48.067 --> 12:49.300
-What?

12:49.333 --> 12:52.133
-You're being like
Snape's secretary
in "Love Actually".

12:52.167 --> 12:53.267
-No, I'm not.

12:53.300 --> 12:54.533
Don't say that!

12:54.567 --> 12:57.067
-So Josh thinks that maybe Tom
is still in love with Claire.

12:57.100 --> 12:59.767
-Oh, my...
-Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

12:59.800 --> 13:02.333
Awkward alert!
-Josh: No, I didn't say that.

13:02.367 --> 13:03.667
Did I say that?
I didn't say that.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.667
-I never heard him say that.
-He didn't say that.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.467
-Yeah, I think he said it
with his eyes.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.700
-Oh, he did say it
with his eyes.
-No!

13:09.733 --> 13:12.833
Don't-- don't trust my eyes.
I was probably thinking about
slow-roasted meats, Ella.

13:12.867 --> 13:15.167
-Tom isn't in love with me.
-I'm not.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.400
-Well, maybe a little bit.

13:17.600 --> 13:18.767
-Why?

13:18.800 --> 13:21.033
-I'm not.
He's just joking.

13:21.067 --> 13:23.400
-Doesn't really
seem like joking.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.733
-I'd kill for some ice.

13:27.767 --> 13:30.200
-I'll go get it.
-Don't, Ella.

13:30.233 --> 13:32.067
-No, it's fine.
I'm Jewish, so--

13:32.100 --> 13:34.567
-Ella, don't go.
-Don't go.

13:35.733 --> 13:37.200
-Really?

13:37.233 --> 13:38.367
-Yes.

13:42.067 --> 13:43.367
-Okay.

13:51.433 --> 13:55.167
-Maybe now that Grace is asleep,
I could just sneak in there

13:55.200 --> 13:58.167
for a little nibble?
Maybe a little munch
on her... on her ear?

13:58.200 --> 13:59.200
-Josh!

13:59.233 --> 14:01.267
-Since when did you start
liking babies, Josh?

14:01.300 --> 14:02.367
You hate babies.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.033
-Other babies, yes.
Not Grace.

14:04.067 --> 14:05.600
Grace is the Beyoncé of babies.

14:05.633 --> 14:08.400
-Josh, you want babies!
-Josh: No.

14:08.433 --> 14:10.533
-Isn't it weird to think
that Beyoncé was a baby once?

14:10.567 --> 14:12.167
You almost just
don't believe it.

14:12.200 --> 14:13.567
-Hey, I don't want babies.

14:13.600 --> 14:14.700
-Oh, me neither.

14:14.733 --> 14:16.233
I'm-- I'm a holiday house.
-Yeah.

14:16.267 --> 14:19.533
-I don't much like drinking
red wine during the day.
Gives me a headache.

14:19.567 --> 14:24.067
-I have seen so much soap
shaped like cupcakes this year.
I'm just sick of it.

14:24.100 --> 14:26.633
Like, it doesn't soap up
like real soap,

14:26.667 --> 14:29.500
nor does it cupcake
like cupcake.

14:29.533 --> 14:30.433
-You said it.

14:31.633 --> 14:35.033
-Um, did you know that,
um, some city birds

14:35.067 --> 14:37.233
have started using
cigarette butts in their nest

14:37.267 --> 14:41.467
because, um, the burnt nicotine
wards off fleas and lice?

14:41.500 --> 14:43.333
-Ah.
-Wow, that's really interesting.

14:43.367 --> 14:46.633
-Sounds like a-- a lie
put out by big tobacco.

14:46.667 --> 14:48.367
-(laughs)

14:53.200 --> 14:54.833
Oh, I thought you were joking.

14:54.867 --> 14:57.600
-No, he was not joking.
-Not joking.

14:57.633 --> 14:59.367
-Tom:
Maybe that's what
those homeless guys are doing

14:59.400 --> 15:02.033
when I see them picking up
cigarette butts off the street.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.100
-Huh?
-Josh: What?

15:03.133 --> 15:04.333
-For their nests?

15:06.233 --> 15:07.800
-Are you sure you're okay?

15:07.833 --> 15:09.600
-What did I say last time?

15:09.633 --> 15:11.467
-That you were fine.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.700
-Okay. So, if I tell you
I'm not fine,

15:13.733 --> 15:15.667
and I hate Christmas,
and I hate myself,

15:15.700 --> 15:17.100
would you back the fuck off?

15:18.200 --> 15:19.333
-Okay.

15:19.367 --> 15:20.700
-Oh!

15:20.733 --> 15:23.200
I forgot to tell you
about Stuart!

15:23.233 --> 15:25.500
Apparently he's back
in the psych ward.

15:25.533 --> 15:27.400
I spoke to his wife,
you know, Hazel,

15:27.433 --> 15:29.567
and apparently he's suffering

15:29.600 --> 15:31.300
from post traumatic
stress disorder

15:31.333 --> 15:33.633
'cause he got in a car accident
and killed three kids.

15:33.667 --> 15:35.267
Uh, Hazel said
it wasn't his fault,

15:35.300 --> 15:36.767
but of course she would
say that, wouldn't she?

15:36.800 --> 15:38.067
-Fuck!

15:38.100 --> 15:39.700
-Poor guy.

15:39.733 --> 15:41.200
-Rose:
Yes, see the problem is

15:41.233 --> 15:43.233
Hazel's now having
a lot of trouble working out

15:43.267 --> 15:45.033
if the bad bits
in his personality

15:45.067 --> 15:48.367
are because of the PTSD
or if it's because
he's just a dickhead.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.167
-Alan:
Oh, Josh, I've been
meaning to ask.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.400
How's your friend Ben?
-Alan!

15:52.433 --> 15:53.500
That was meant
to be a secret!

15:53.533 --> 15:55.667
-Oh, no. It's--
it's okay. I know.

15:55.700 --> 15:58.033
-Yeah, everybody knows.
It's fine.

15:58.067 --> 16:01.200
Ben is recovering well.
Thank you for asking.

16:01.233 --> 16:02.733
-(Grace cries)

16:05.800 --> 16:08.000
-Please can we not mention it?

16:09.267 --> 16:10.600
-(John wheezes)
-Oh, shit!

16:10.633 --> 16:12.133
John, buddy,
what have you eaten?

16:12.167 --> 16:14.700
-Oh-- oh-- it's-- it's okay.
I'll-- I'll get it.

16:14.733 --> 16:17.067
-Hey, hey, hey, hey,
you all right?

16:17.100 --> 16:19.033
-(Grace continues crying)

16:19.067 --> 16:20.133
-She sounds very distressed.

16:20.167 --> 16:21.733
What if something is wrong?

16:21.767 --> 16:22.967
-Nothing is wrong.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.233
-Do you want a holiday house
on the beach or in the country?

16:25.267 --> 16:26.367
-Um, beach.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.567
Um, with a fireplace
and a grand piano.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.067
-She just sounds so sad.

16:30.100 --> 16:33.067
-I just want to spread
her ear on a little cracker
with some quince paste.

16:33.100 --> 16:35.667
-Can I just stand
outside the door and check?
-No, okay?

16:35.700 --> 16:37.433
No one is picking her up!

16:39.467 --> 16:40.733
-(Grace stops crying)

16:45.233 --> 16:46.600
-All right, so who's Ben?

16:46.633 --> 16:48.167
-Sorry.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.267
Ben is a friend of mine.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.167
He had brain surgery.

16:50.200 --> 16:51.433
I really don't want
to talk about it.

16:51.467 --> 16:52.600
-Rose:
What friend?

16:52.633 --> 16:53.767
You don't have
any other friends.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.367
-I am branching out.

16:55.400 --> 16:56.667
-Where would you meet
other friends?

16:56.700 --> 16:59.233
-Just around.
-Rose: What, on the internet?

16:59.267 --> 17:01.300
You don't know
who you're talking to
on the internet, Josh.

17:01.333 --> 17:04.667
-Could be a troll.
-Could someone please
change the subject?

17:04.700 --> 17:07.700
-How are so many guys
interested in you?

17:07.733 --> 17:09.067
What do they see in you?

17:09.100 --> 17:10.700
-Personality.

17:10.733 --> 17:12.633
-No. No, no.

17:12.667 --> 17:14.133
No, no, no.

17:14.167 --> 17:16.800
-Yes.
-Arnold, can you shed
some light on this?

17:16.833 --> 17:18.367
-No. I can't remember.
-Tom: Claire?

17:18.400 --> 17:20.067
-Mm. I was a teenager.
I had no confidence.

17:20.100 --> 17:22.600
-Oh. Wish I could do
a focus group and figure it out.

17:22.633 --> 17:24.667
-I think maybe they get lost
in my eyes.

17:24.700 --> 17:26.200
-Claire: Ha.
-Mm!

17:26.233 --> 17:27.800
Why are you friends
with him, Tom?

17:27.833 --> 17:29.667
-Tom:
Uh, desperation...

17:29.700 --> 17:31.200
convenience...

17:31.233 --> 17:33.400
and hon-- honestly, uh...

17:33.433 --> 17:35.767
being friends with Josh
is just slightly less effort

17:35.800 --> 17:37.667
than having to find
somewhere else to live.

17:37.700 --> 17:39.333
-(giggles)

17:39.367 --> 17:40.767
-The same for you?

17:40.800 --> 17:42.333
-Okay. Well, he does
nice things.

17:42.367 --> 17:43.800
For example, before,
he took the blame

17:43.833 --> 17:44.800
for me dropping the gravy.

17:44.833 --> 17:47.067
-(all gasp)
-Oh, no.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.067
-Tom:
Whoa!

17:48.100 --> 17:49.633
Whoa!

17:49.667 --> 17:51.433
So, there was gravy?

17:51.467 --> 17:53.500
-Yeah, there-- there was,
but I dropped it.

17:53.533 --> 17:55.133
-You dropped the gravy?

17:55.167 --> 17:57.067
-Yeah, I dropped the gravy.
-Claire: Oh, my God.

17:57.100 --> 17:59.367
He just keeps
saying it out loud.
-What? It's just gravy.

17:59.400 --> 18:00.333
-Tom:
Just gravy?!

18:00.367 --> 18:02.467
Arnold, now you're just
being antagonistic.

18:02.500 --> 18:05.667
-Arnold, the thing
you need to know about gravy
is that it's just so good.

18:05.700 --> 18:07.267
-It's like the heart
of a guide dog.

18:07.300 --> 18:09.367
-Mae:
Vegetarian, huh?

18:09.400 --> 18:10.300
Yeah? Am I right?

18:10.333 --> 18:12.233
-I didn't do it
because I'm a vegetarian.

18:12.267 --> 18:15.067
I... it was a mistake.

18:15.100 --> 18:16.500
-I can't fix this for you.

18:16.533 --> 18:19.100
I just-- I cannot
fix this for you.

18:19.133 --> 18:20.533
-Just imagine Josh

18:20.567 --> 18:22.267
seeing all that gravy
on the floor?

18:22.300 --> 18:24.367
His little homely face
would've just dropped.

18:24.400 --> 18:26.600
-Ella:
It's too upsetting
to bear thinking about.

18:26.633 --> 18:28.233
-I wish you'd never told me.

18:28.267 --> 18:30.167
-Rose:
Yeah, now, I knew
that Josh would

18:30.200 --> 18:33.100
not forget the gravy.
I knew that.

18:33.133 --> 18:34.733
-Josh, can I ask
was it packet gravy

18:34.767 --> 18:35.833
or did you make it
from scratch?

18:35.867 --> 18:37.367
-I made it from scratch, Dad.

18:37.400 --> 18:38.500
I'm not a douchebag.

18:38.533 --> 18:39.667
-Tom:
I was enjoying this lunch,

18:39.700 --> 18:44.233
but now, now I can't bear
another bite.

18:44.267 --> 18:46.533
-And probably for the best
with those cheeks, am I right?

18:46.567 --> 18:47.433
(chuckles)

18:48.700 --> 18:50.167
-Tom:
Oh...

18:50.200 --> 18:53.700
Not even a laugh
for my cheeks, Arnold.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.767
Not even a pity laugh
from your boyfriend.

18:56.800 --> 18:59.533
I mean, that's how you know
you fucked up.

19:01.067 --> 19:02.100
-(all gasp)

19:02.133 --> 19:03.167
-Oh, my God.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.100
-There's your gravy.

19:05.133 --> 19:06.300
(chuckles)

19:15.433 --> 19:18.167
-(cuckoo clock rings)

19:24.100 --> 19:25.467
-Arnold.

19:25.500 --> 19:27.467
-I know that was
a weird choice.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.467
I'm just a bit on edge.

19:32.233 --> 19:34.367
Mohammed's going to pick me up
in a big black car

19:34.400 --> 19:37.633
and take me to a very fancy
and entirely emotionally cold
family Christmas.

19:37.667 --> 19:39.733
-Okay, if that's what you like.
If that's what you want.

19:39.767 --> 19:42.100
Yeah.
-(grunts)

19:42.133 --> 19:43.033
-Get me higher.

19:43.067 --> 19:44.167
Get me higher.

19:44.200 --> 19:45.700
Higher, you dog!
-I'm trying!

19:45.733 --> 19:47.300
-Higher, you dog!
-(grunts)

19:47.333 --> 19:48.667
-I'm tr-- Josh...

19:50.600 --> 19:52.300
Josh?
-Yes?

19:52.333 --> 19:54.600
-I don't want to
move in with you.

19:54.633 --> 19:57.300
-Let me down.

19:57.333 --> 19:58.733
-I just...

19:58.767 --> 20:01.200
When-- when I dropped the gravy,
I thought that might be it.

20:01.233 --> 20:04.533
I thought, "Oh, you're gonna
break up with me."

20:04.567 --> 20:06.667
I thought, "I'll bet
Ben never drops gravy."

20:06.700 --> 20:08.500
All lunch I kept thinking
that I was being

20:08.533 --> 20:11.100
less interesting than Ben,
and I can't spend my life

20:11.133 --> 20:12.200
worried that
you're going to find

20:12.233 --> 20:14.200
some vulnerable guy
with arthritis,

20:14.233 --> 20:15.800
or chronic psoriasis,
or whatever.

20:15.833 --> 20:17.533
I just... I'm tired.

20:17.567 --> 20:19.733
-What's a nice thing
I can do for you

20:19.767 --> 20:22.600
to prove that there's nothing
going on between me and Ben?

20:22.633 --> 20:24.567
Not a nice thing.
Even maybe a mean thing.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.200
Do you wanna go
and punch him in the balls?

20:26.233 --> 20:27.467
Do you want to go?
Me and you,

20:27.500 --> 20:29.100
we'll go in that car,
we'll go to the hospital,

20:29.133 --> 20:30.733
we'll punch Ben in the balls.

20:30.767 --> 20:32.633
Don't think I won't do it.

20:32.667 --> 20:33.767
-I don't know.

20:35.800 --> 20:37.133
-All right.

20:44.300 --> 20:46.333
-Merry Christmas.
-Yeah.

20:46.367 --> 20:47.700
Merry Christmas.

20:51.700 --> 20:53.633
-* Doo-wop, doo-wop

20:53.667 --> 20:56.200
* Doo-wop, doo-wop

20:56.233 --> 20:58.367
* Doo-wop, doo-wop

20:58.400 --> 21:00.600
* Doo-wop, doo-wop

21:00.633 --> 21:02.600
* Doo-wop, doo-wop

21:02.633 --> 21:05.100
* Doo-wop, doo-wop

21:05.133 --> 21:06.267
* Ah

21:06.300 --> 21:07.100
-Josh:
He's fine.

21:07.133 --> 21:08.733
He just wanted
to go see his family.

21:08.767 --> 21:10.333
-He's still not upset about Ben?

21:10.367 --> 21:12.533
-I don't want to talk about it.
-Alan: Just remember, Josh,

21:12.567 --> 21:14.367
it'd be weird for Arnold
knowing that you had Ben

21:14.400 --> 21:15.833
in the back of your mind.
-He doesn't have Ben

21:15.867 --> 21:18.033
in the back of his mind.
They're just friends.

21:18.067 --> 21:19.100
-Rose:
No no, not.-- Claire--

21:19.133 --> 21:20.300
Claire said they were lovers.

21:20.333 --> 21:21.400
-Why would she say that?

21:21.433 --> 21:23.367
-I'm just not helping
today, am I?

21:23.400 --> 21:25.033
-There are a lot
of desserts, Josh!

21:25.067 --> 21:26.367
-Yeah. Why so much dessert?

21:26.400 --> 21:27.567
We're never going to eat it all.

21:27.600 --> 21:28.833
-Did you know there are
people out there

21:28.867 --> 21:30.233
who didn't have
Christmas lunch today

21:30.267 --> 21:31.333
and here we are
with all this food

21:31.367 --> 21:32.833
and it's going
to go to waste?

21:32.867 --> 21:35.133
-I just thought it'd be nice
to have a variety of desserts!
-(clanking)

21:35.167 --> 21:37.200
-Pretty worked up
about the dessert, Josh.
-Josh: Sorry.

21:37.233 --> 21:38.433
-Dessert is
"stressed" backwards.

21:38.467 --> 21:41.133
-No, Tom! You can't
feed him chocolate.
-That's a myth.

21:41.167 --> 21:42.467
-Yeah, remember
when he vomited?

21:42.500 --> 21:43.733
-Claire:
This punch is so warm.

21:43.767 --> 21:45.533
-Yeah, it's really
not drinkable without ice.

21:45.567 --> 21:46.633
I mean, there--
there's red wine,

21:46.667 --> 21:48.400
but I don't like drinking
red wine during the day.

21:48.433 --> 21:49.533
-Josh:
Then go and get ice, Dad.

21:49.567 --> 21:52.167
Okay? I didn't know Tom was
going to forget the ice.

21:52.200 --> 21:54.067
I'm sorry, but that's
the situation we're in, okay?

21:54.100 --> 21:56.533
So, either leave
and get ice, or shut up.

21:56.567 --> 21:58.700
-Rose:
Oh, you always get
so worked up around Christmas.

21:58.733 --> 22:00.533
-No, actually it's not
Christmas's fault.

22:00.567 --> 22:02.433
Let's not blame Jesus.
It was having to hang out alone

22:02.467 --> 22:05.200
every year with you and Dad
and Peg just pecking at me.

22:05.233 --> 22:07.433
Just peck, peck,
peck, peck, peck.

22:07.467 --> 22:10.033
-We're just trying
to have a good time.
-Josh: I know.

22:10.067 --> 22:12.700
I know I'm being unfair
and I'm sorry, okay?

22:12.733 --> 22:16.467
But fuck, when I say to you
"I don't want to talk about it,"

22:16.500 --> 22:19.367
why can't you stop
talking about it?

22:19.400 --> 22:21.300
-Son, this is about
Arnold and Ben.

22:21.333 --> 22:22.633
-Josh:
Actually I thought
I was pretty clear.

22:22.667 --> 22:25.733
Okay? This is about you.
I'm frustrated with you, okay?

22:25.767 --> 22:27.500
Claire keeps telling me
how disappointed she is

22:27.533 --> 22:28.667
with her life
instead of going out

22:28.700 --> 22:30.567
and creating herself
a better life.

22:30.600 --> 22:33.033
Tom keeps making
the most horrible choices,

22:33.067 --> 22:34.833
and then everyone pretends
it's not his fault.

22:34.867 --> 22:36.300
It is your fault, Tom.

22:36.333 --> 22:38.767
Ella, it is Tom's fault.
Everything.

22:38.800 --> 22:39.900
You probably should have left.

22:39.933 --> 22:42.267
Hannah, well, no one's allowed
to make fun of Hannah.

22:42.300 --> 22:45.033
And Mae, well, Mae's fine.

22:45.067 --> 22:46.433
Although I don't really
understand why

22:46.467 --> 22:48.367
you bought me a book
of easy midweek recipes.

22:48.400 --> 22:49.333
You know I know how to cook.

22:49.367 --> 22:51.100
-It was cheap.
-Fair enough.

22:51.133 --> 22:52.367
Dad is incapable
of communicating

22:52.400 --> 22:54.267
with me about feelings,
so instead, he just talks

22:54.300 --> 22:56.433
about chores that need
to be done all the time.

22:56.467 --> 22:57.667
Mum, well it's pretty obvious

22:57.700 --> 23:00.100
that you've made the choice
to go off your medication again.

23:00.133 --> 23:01.733
You're going to be depressed
in two days, again,

23:01.767 --> 23:04.733
and then you're going to expect
me to be there to help, again.

23:04.767 --> 23:07.500
Okay? This is not about Arnold,
this is not about Ben,

23:07.533 --> 23:09.367
this is not
about Jesus, all right?

23:09.400 --> 23:13.333
This is about you and...
and to be honest,

23:13.367 --> 23:14.667
I've run out of things to say,

23:14.700 --> 23:15.633
but I'm not
going to stop talking

23:15.667 --> 23:17.533
because I appreciate
that I'm as bad as you,

23:17.567 --> 23:18.967
and I know
as soon as I stop talking,

23:19.000 --> 23:21.367
you're going to say
something that's probably
quite embarrassing.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.533
So, what I'm going to do
is I'm going to take this trifle

23:24.567 --> 23:27.400
and I'm going to go.

23:27.433 --> 23:28.400
-To Arnold?
-No.

23:28.433 --> 23:29.233
-Ben?
-No!

23:29.267 --> 23:31.300
I'm gonna go
and sit alone in a park

23:31.333 --> 23:33.233
with my dog and a trifle.

23:33.267 --> 23:35.400
-Take some shortbread!

23:40.833 --> 23:42.300
You should have seen
the tantrum he threw

23:42.333 --> 23:44.200
when we gave him
the wrong "Donkey Kong".

23:44.233 --> 23:46.200
-Yeah, I heard that.

23:46.233 --> 23:47.567
What happened was
you gave me the same game

23:47.600 --> 23:49.433
that you already gave me
the previous Christmas.

23:49.467 --> 23:51.000
I'm an only child.

23:53.567 --> 23:54.667
-(door slams shut)

24:01.667 --> 24:04.000
-(vocalizing)
