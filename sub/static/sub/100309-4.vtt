00:00.130 --> 00:02.010
Previously on "Manifest"...

00:02.010 --> 00:03.220
Detective Stone,
what do you know

00:03.220 --> 00:04.340
about the night
you were shot?

00:04.340 --> 00:05.550
I know
that it was an accident.

00:05.550 --> 00:07.350
I also know
that Detective Vasquez

00:07.350 --> 00:09.350
broke into my house
without probable cause

00:09.350 --> 00:11.810
to confront Zeke Landon.

00:11.810 --> 00:14.480
No one's ever done
anything like that for me.

00:14.480 --> 00:18.980
My dad, my brother, and my aunt
were all 828 passengers.

00:18.980 --> 00:20.570
Being here...

00:20.570 --> 00:23.860
I now realize that we --
we all belong.

00:23.860 --> 00:26.030
Never mind.
I got this.

00:26.030 --> 00:28.070
Evie,
no, you don't.

00:29.030 --> 00:30.040
Can you hear me?

00:31.490 --> 00:34.870
How could you come here?
Get out of this house.

00:34.870 --> 00:36.250
Saanvi: You were right.
I found the leak.

00:36.250 --> 00:38.170
I only told one person
about that vial.

00:38.170 --> 00:39.340
My psychiatrist.

00:39.340 --> 00:40.590
There.

00:40.590 --> 00:42.260
Ben: She's not informing
the Major.

00:42.260 --> 00:43.340
She is the Major.

00:43.340 --> 00:45.220
Now we turn
the tables.

00:55.260 --> 00:56.550
Here you go.

00:56.550 --> 00:57.800
Thanks.

00:57.800 --> 00:59.720
"Old Yeller's" decent.
Cute dog.

00:59.720 --> 01:01.720
Spoiler alert --
bummer ending.

01:01.720 --> 01:03.810
But if you want
a really cool adventure,

01:03.810 --> 01:05.480
check out
"A Wrinkle in Time."

01:08.270 --> 01:10.070
Olive, we're next.

01:15.150 --> 01:17.280
Grace: There you are.

01:17.280 --> 01:19.080
Your dad and brother
got on Flight 828.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.580
It lands a few hours
after ours.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.450
Are you sure you don't want
to go with Cal?

01:22.450 --> 01:24.460
No, I like us having
mom/daughter time.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.080
Oh, me, too.

01:27.290 --> 01:29.790
Gate agent: Final call
for JFK passengers

01:29.790 --> 01:32.170
willing to take a later flight.

01:32.170 --> 01:36.260
Final call for JFK passengers
willing to take a later flight.

01:38.340 --> 01:41.680
Actually, Mom, will you be upset
if I do go with them?

01:41.680 --> 01:44.140
What happened
to mom/daughter time?

01:44.140 --> 01:46.190
Next weekend.
Mani-pedis?

01:46.190 --> 01:47.810
Okay, go.

01:52.940 --> 01:54.940
The book's really good
so far.

01:54.940 --> 01:57.780
Yeah, if you like that,
then you'll love Homer.

01:57.780 --> 02:00.200
I don't read Latin.
I'm 10 1/2.

02:00.200 --> 02:02.990
What's up, Ten-and-a-Half?
I'm TJ.

02:02.990 --> 02:05.120
Adrian: Miracles.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.000
All the world's religions

02:07.000 --> 02:11.130
have been based
on apocryphal miracles.

02:11.130 --> 02:14.510
Resurrection, reincarnation --

02:14.510 --> 02:18.800
all rumors and myths
that trace back millennia.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.390
Until Flight 828 returned.

02:22.970 --> 02:27.310
That 191 miracle returnees
reappeared on Earth

02:27.310 --> 02:31.150
makes an undeniable case
for miracles tomorrow.

02:31.150 --> 02:34.860
Believe in the miracle
of Flight 828.

02:34.860 --> 02:38.150
Believe in the passengers,
who, after escaping death,

02:38.150 --> 02:41.740
will now walk among you
for decades to come.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.230
After a month of testing,

03:14.230 --> 03:17.030
I was able to confirm
elimination of the 828 anomaly

03:17.030 --> 03:18.690
in a petri dish.

03:18.690 --> 03:20.610
Now I need to move on
to phase two --

03:20.610 --> 03:22.870
test the viability and toxicity
of the serum

03:22.870 --> 03:24.370
on a living specimen.

03:25.370 --> 03:27.700
Alright, Hero.
Let's do this.

03:33.420 --> 03:36.750
I got to go, but if you
survive this, little buddy,

03:36.750 --> 03:39.050
we might have a chance
of beating the Death Date.

03:39.050 --> 03:41.130
Fingers crossed and lips sealed.

03:55.570 --> 04:00.150
I wish I was there
walking you down the aisle,

04:00.150 --> 04:03.740
seeing your radiant smile

04:03.740 --> 04:07.910
and wearing what I am sure
is a killer dress.

04:09.910 --> 04:12.460
Prettiest bride there ever was.

04:12.460 --> 04:13.620
No doubt.

04:17.590 --> 04:19.960
I need you to know
that I never...

04:21.760 --> 04:23.930
I never stopped trying, Olive.

04:23.930 --> 04:26.850
What I would've given
to have been there.

04:26.850 --> 04:28.260
What are you doing?
Uh...

04:30.680 --> 04:32.270
Delete it.

04:32.270 --> 04:34.350
Grace.
Ben, delete it.

04:34.350 --> 04:36.190
You're not giving up.

04:36.190 --> 04:37.690
I won't let you.

04:37.690 --> 04:41.780
I'm not giving up.
I never will.

04:41.780 --> 04:44.280
But, Grace, I haven't found
a new clue in over a month.

04:44.280 --> 04:46.820
There hasn't been another
Plane Calling in all that time,

04:46.820 --> 04:49.160
and I still haven't come across
one other passenger

04:49.160 --> 04:50.660
even aware
of the Death Date.

04:50.660 --> 04:52.620
You have five years.

04:52.620 --> 04:55.120
Why are you torturing yourself
like this?

04:57.170 --> 04:59.130
Peace of mind.

05:04.300 --> 05:06.180
I believe in you.

05:06.180 --> 05:07.970
You will find a way.

05:18.560 --> 05:21.650
Evie is so excited.

05:21.650 --> 05:25.740
Her outfit, shoes, handbag --
it's all blush pink.

05:25.740 --> 05:27.320
Had it dyed to match.

05:27.320 --> 05:28.490
Have you seen it?

05:28.490 --> 05:31.330
I have, yeah.

05:31.330 --> 05:34.080
It warms our hearts each time
you walk in the door.

05:34.080 --> 05:35.540
That makes three of us.

05:35.540 --> 05:36.830
Thank you.

05:36.830 --> 05:40.000
So, who are you taking
to prom?

05:40.000 --> 05:43.340
Um, I don't actually
have a date.

05:43.340 --> 05:44.670
Really?

05:44.670 --> 05:46.680
There isn't a boy
you're interested in?

05:49.760 --> 05:52.770
You know what?
There is, actually.

05:52.770 --> 05:54.180
Mm.

05:54.180 --> 05:55.180
He's new.

05:55.180 --> 05:57.190
He's kind of
a loner type,

05:57.190 --> 05:59.110
but he's got
a really good heart.

05:59.110 --> 06:01.020
Mm. Good heart
goes a long way.

06:01.020 --> 06:03.690
Yeah.

06:03.690 --> 06:05.740
We haven't talked that much
in the past month.

06:05.740 --> 06:08.070
To be honest, I don't even
really know him that well,

06:08.070 --> 06:12.580
but there's something about him
that's drawn me towards him.

06:14.450 --> 06:18.210
The last guy that I dated,
it didn't go so well.

06:18.210 --> 06:21.920
We, um, kind of broke
each other's hearts,

06:21.920 --> 06:26.720
and I'm scared of opening myself
back up and then lose him,

06:26.720 --> 06:31.550
because I don't -- I don't know
how long he's gonna be around.

06:32.890 --> 06:34.720
You're a strong girl.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.730
I see it in your eyes.

06:36.730 --> 06:40.400
And loving someone is
the bravest thing you can do.

06:41.810 --> 06:46.400
So let go and be happy,
even if it's for a little while.

06:46.400 --> 06:49.240
I promise it'll be worth it.

06:55.290 --> 06:58.910
W-What's your name
again, dear?

07:01.750 --> 07:04.340
It's Michaela.
I go to school with Evie.

07:04.340 --> 07:06.260
Nice to meet you,
Michaela.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.420
Very nice
to meet you, too.

07:14.880 --> 07:16.300
Isaiah,
you're taking lead

07:16.300 --> 07:17.970
on the soup kitchen
in Corona tonight.

07:17.970 --> 07:21.470
Got it. Uh, I've got new flyers
ready for distribution, too.

07:21.470 --> 07:24.010
Olive.

07:24.010 --> 07:26.520
Can I speak to you?

07:26.520 --> 07:28.560
Privately?

07:28.560 --> 07:32.730
What you said at your sermon
today, "decades to come"?

07:32.730 --> 07:36.650
Have you heard about
the Death Date?

07:36.650 --> 07:37.860
Enlighten me.

07:40.910 --> 07:43.990
Olive, whatever it is,
it's okay.

07:43.990 --> 07:46.200
It's not.

07:46.200 --> 07:49.540
My dad, Cal,
my Aunt Mick,

07:49.540 --> 07:53.750
they all had these Callings
showing that they're gonna die

07:53.750 --> 07:57.210
5 1/2 years
after 828 returned.

07:57.210 --> 08:00.050
They know
the exact date.

08:00.050 --> 08:02.550
June 2, 2024.

08:06.180 --> 08:09.850
And I'm sorry to drop
this bomb on you,

08:09.850 --> 08:12.690
but my dad's been working
like crazy

08:12.690 --> 08:14.360
trying to find
a way around it.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.690
He's afraid.

08:16.690 --> 08:19.360
We choose
which path we follow.

08:19.360 --> 08:24.030
Fear begets fear,
and miracles beget miracles.

08:24.030 --> 08:25.780
We were saved before.

08:25.780 --> 08:28.790
We'll be saved again.
If we believe.

08:33.920 --> 08:36.250
Hey, Professor Stone.
Busy?

08:36.250 --> 08:38.300
"Professor Stone."

08:38.300 --> 08:40.220
That never gets old.

08:40.220 --> 08:43.590
Just grading papers.
What can I do you for, TJ?

08:43.590 --> 08:45.760
I had another Calling.

08:45.760 --> 08:49.060
What do you know about a bug,
a bird, a fish, and a tiger?

08:56.270 --> 08:59.570
Coincidence you've been eating
here so much during my shifts?

09:01.240 --> 09:03.070
Coincidence you've been working
so much during my meals?

09:03.070 --> 09:04.950
Just ask me out
for dinner already.

09:06.660 --> 09:08.790
I would, honestly.

09:08.790 --> 09:10.910
I just got out
of something.

09:10.910 --> 09:12.580
Two somethings,
actually.

09:12.580 --> 09:14.920
Not really ready
for another something.

09:14.920 --> 09:17.630
Then maybe we just skip
the dinner.

09:17.630 --> 09:21.760
Hey, leave the poor bastard
alone and get me another beer.

09:21.760 --> 09:23.930
Saved by the brother.

09:23.930 --> 09:25.760
Coming up, Billy boy.

09:36.110 --> 09:37.610
Michaela:
Bring him back.

09:47.620 --> 09:48.950
Bring who back?

09:48.950 --> 09:50.450
Bring him back.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.960
Bring him back.

10:18.810 --> 10:20.980
Bring him back.

10:23.820 --> 10:25.070
Zeke.

10:26.570 --> 10:28.160
What are you
doing here?

10:28.160 --> 10:31.200
I think -- I-I think
I'm supposed to bring --

10:31.200 --> 10:33.500
Bring him back?
Yeah. Me, too.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.540
Um...

10:37.540 --> 10:39.590
What, you thought the
Calling was telling
you to bring me back?

10:39.590 --> 10:42.670
I don't know.

10:42.670 --> 10:45.010
I mean, do you see anyone here
who looks like they need help?

10:45.010 --> 10:47.340
Not yet.

10:47.340 --> 10:50.510
But I'm glad we're
doing this together.

10:50.510 --> 10:52.560
I called you.
Couple times.

10:52.560 --> 10:55.020
Yeah, sorry.
I've just been overwhelmed.

10:55.020 --> 10:58.060
With what? Work?
Is it me?

10:58.060 --> 10:59.770
Why haven't I
seen you lately?

10:59.770 --> 11:02.070
Man: Everybody down!

11:02.070 --> 11:04.860
Everybody get down!
Don't touch it! Don't touch it!

11:04.860 --> 11:06.400
Get down!

11:06.400 --> 11:09.360
Everybody
down on the floor now!

11:10.410 --> 11:11.700
I'm off duty.

11:11.700 --> 11:13.450
I don't have my gun.

11:13.450 --> 11:15.700
Get down!
On the ground!

11:15.700 --> 11:17.960
The Calling brought us here
for this?

11:17.960 --> 11:19.540
Get down!

11:23.800 --> 11:26.050
Down! Get down!

11:26.050 --> 11:28.550
Okay, everybody stay down.

11:28.550 --> 11:30.220
Stay down.

11:30.220 --> 11:31.760
You!

11:31.760 --> 11:33.890
Yeah, you, you, move.

11:33.890 --> 11:35.220
Move to the back.

11:35.220 --> 11:36.430
Come on.
Everybody move.

11:36.430 --> 11:37.560
Move!

11:37.560 --> 11:38.770
Come on.

11:41.980 --> 11:44.780
Okay, phones.
Phones.

11:44.780 --> 11:47.240
Give me your phones.
Put your phone in there.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.740
We got to
calm this guy down.

11:48.740 --> 11:50.410
Easier said than done.
He's a total amateur.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.120
Out of the way.
How can you tell?

11:52.120 --> 11:54.490
Out of the way. Move.
He's got no body armor,
no backup.

11:54.490 --> 11:56.580
He hasn't taken out
a single camera.

11:56.580 --> 11:59.750
Most of the time these guys are
in and out, three minutes max.

11:59.750 --> 12:01.250
So he doesn't know
what he's doing.

12:01.250 --> 12:03.290
No phones?
That's a good thing,
right?

12:03.290 --> 12:05.920
No, it means he's unpredictable,
dangerous.

12:05.920 --> 12:08.470
Yeah,
but if he's not a pro,

12:08.470 --> 12:10.680
maybe we can figure out a way
to take him down.

12:10.680 --> 12:12.430
-Please, please.
-Stay down.

12:12.430 --> 12:13.760
Nobody
needs to get hurt.

12:13.760 --> 12:15.310
No, get down. No.

12:15.310 --> 12:16.770
No talking.

12:19.850 --> 12:21.480
Hey.
Y--

12:21.480 --> 12:23.610
I can tell that you haven't
done this before.

12:23.610 --> 12:25.320
I s--
I said no talking.

12:25.320 --> 12:27.610
You don't want anyone
to get hurt, right?

12:27.610 --> 12:29.280
How about we get him some money
out of the drawers?

12:29.280 --> 12:32.700
No, I don't care
about money.

12:32.700 --> 12:34.870
I need to get into
the vault.

12:34.870 --> 12:36.700
The vault is locked.

12:36.700 --> 12:38.120
It shuts down
automatically

12:38.120 --> 12:39.960
whenever the silent alarm
is triggered.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.870
Buddy, you're better off just
getting money from the register.

12:41.870 --> 12:44.040
You're not listening
to me!

12:44.040 --> 12:47.210
I don't care about money.

12:47.210 --> 12:49.550
I need to get into
the vault.

12:50.880 --> 12:51.880
Zeke!

13:03.560 --> 13:05.360
You were on 828.

13:08.230 --> 13:09.480
So was I.

13:12.990 --> 13:15.740
My research
has stalled out.

13:15.740 --> 13:19.080
There's a geneticist in Sweden
that might be able to help,

13:19.080 --> 13:20.830
but if he can't,

13:20.830 --> 13:24.040
I think I might have to give up
working on the anomaly.

13:24.040 --> 13:25.670
Bang. You're dead.

13:25.670 --> 13:27.540
Come on.
That was a good one.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.170
Stop fidgeting
with your necklace.

13:29.170 --> 13:30.510
It's a dead giveaway.

13:30.510 --> 13:33.180
The Major is a seasoned
intelligence officer.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.180
Busy up your hands.
Eat an apple or something.

13:35.180 --> 13:37.890
I don't understand
how lying about needing help

13:37.890 --> 13:39.890
from some made-up
Swedish geneticist

13:39.890 --> 13:41.230
gets us anywhere.

13:41.230 --> 13:43.190
When the Major hears
a foreign scientist

13:43.190 --> 13:44.850
might prove useful to her,

13:44.850 --> 13:47.110
I'm betting it'll activate her
to reach out to her superiors.

13:47.110 --> 13:48.730
Why?
Isn't exposing her enough?

13:48.730 --> 13:49.940
She's a shadow.

13:49.940 --> 13:51.190
We expose her,
she disappears,

13:51.190 --> 13:53.200
another black op opens up
in her place.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.530
But if we can identify someone
who'll be hurt by this scandal,

13:56.530 --> 14:00.410
then we can go to the press,
break this wide open.

14:00.410 --> 14:03.960
You and Ben really think
that this is a good idea?

14:03.960 --> 14:06.580
You know,
you can ask him yourself.

14:10.380 --> 14:13.220
This isn't junior high.
Start talking already.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.380
It's been weeks.

14:14.380 --> 14:16.050
He lied to me.

14:16.050 --> 14:19.550
Ben only lied to you
because I made him lie to you.

14:19.550 --> 14:21.560
Let's just focus on
what I should be doing.

14:21.560 --> 14:24.060
Good. You still holding up
appearances at the hospital?

14:24.060 --> 14:26.310
Yes, leaving placebo samples
at my lab,

14:26.310 --> 14:29.560
which so-called Dr. Matthews
is still siphoning.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.230
Good.
I know you're anxious

14:31.230 --> 14:33.400
to get back to your
real 828 research,

14:33.400 --> 14:35.570
but I need you
to hold off completely

14:35.570 --> 14:37.740
until we shut down
the Major.

14:37.740 --> 14:41.080
We're close.
And we can't risk anything.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.410
I know.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.500
TJ:
These are the images I saw,

14:46.500 --> 14:49.420
along with "2012,"
which I assume is the year.

14:51.090 --> 14:52.920
I don't even know
what we're looking for.

14:54.510 --> 14:55.920
Olive.

14:55.920 --> 14:57.760
Hey, I was on my way
to SAT prep.

14:57.760 --> 14:59.590
Just wanted to stop by
and say hi.

14:59.590 --> 15:01.430
And borrow 20 bucks.

15:01.430 --> 15:04.680
Well, I was gonna ask for $10,
but $20's good.

15:05.770 --> 15:06.940
I'm TJ.

15:06.940 --> 15:09.020
TJ was on
Flight 828.

15:09.020 --> 15:10.440
Y-You might
remember him.

15:10.440 --> 15:12.150
He was at the airport
in Jamaica.

15:13.440 --> 15:15.940
You look...familiar.

15:17.320 --> 15:19.160
Gate agent: Next.

15:19.160 --> 15:21.660
Hey, any seats left
on that later flight?

15:21.660 --> 15:23.290
I was hoping to get
one of those vouchers,

15:23.290 --> 15:24.790
take my mom to San Francisco
next summer.

15:25.870 --> 15:27.500
One seat left.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.170
Nice. I'll take it.

15:29.170 --> 15:31.380
Unless, of course,
Ten-and-a-Half here wants it.

15:31.380 --> 15:33.960
It's okay.
You can have it.

15:33.960 --> 15:36.010
Keep reading,
Ten-and-a-Half.

15:38.970 --> 15:42.010
Sorry,
you don't ring a bell.

15:42.010 --> 15:44.680
So what are you guys
working on?

15:44.680 --> 15:47.810
TJ had a Calling, and I'm trying
to help him figure it out.

15:47.810 --> 15:49.560
Even though
she wasn't with us,

15:49.560 --> 15:52.190
she has an uncanny knack
for this stuff.

15:52.190 --> 15:56.490
So why are you guys researching
the Gramercy Club?

15:56.490 --> 15:57.820
The animals.

15:57.820 --> 16:00.490
That's the logo
for the Gramercy Club.

16:00.490 --> 16:03.870
Oh, I mean, where have you guys
been the past five years?

16:03.870 --> 16:05.740
Alright, it's this cool,

16:05.740 --> 16:08.330
members-only athletic club
in the city.

16:08.330 --> 16:10.670
Some of the rich kids
at my school belong to it.

16:10.670 --> 16:15.340
Fancy restaurants, bars,
a bunch of courts and pools.

16:15.340 --> 16:18.170
I never scored an invite
myself.

16:18.170 --> 16:19.340
Let's go.

16:19.340 --> 16:21.340
Maybe there's
something big there.

16:21.340 --> 16:22.760
Uh, wait a minute.

16:22.760 --> 16:25.850
I would love my 20 bucks now,
thank you.

16:27.850 --> 16:29.850
-Love you.
-Love you.

16:29.850 --> 16:31.350
See ya.

16:33.730 --> 16:35.940
Yeah, see ya.

16:38.070 --> 16:40.200
I was on the plane, too.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.200
My name's Michaela.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.870
I'm Logan.

16:43.870 --> 16:45.370
Logan, look,
I understand, okay?

16:45.370 --> 16:46.950
Coming back was hard
for all of us.

16:46.950 --> 16:49.040
I felt confused
and isolated.

16:49.040 --> 16:52.540
Nobody understood what --
I can't believe you were
on 828.

16:52.540 --> 16:54.880
Why the hell are we
at the same bank together?

16:54.880 --> 16:57.380
We're trying
to figure that out.

16:57.380 --> 16:59.090
You're another one of us?

16:59.090 --> 17:00.380
It's complicated.

17:00.380 --> 17:04.220
Logan, can I --
um, can...

17:04.220 --> 17:07.310
D-Do you see visions
or hear voices?

17:07.310 --> 17:09.270
Because I do, too.

17:09.270 --> 17:11.770
That's how
I wound up here today.

17:17.270 --> 17:18.900
Damn it!

17:18.900 --> 17:20.900
You hit the alarm!

17:20.900 --> 17:22.570
Look, I'm NYPD, okay?
I can help you --

17:22.570 --> 17:24.280
You're a cop?!

17:24.280 --> 17:25.780
Take it easy.

17:25.780 --> 17:27.910
Put the gun down,
and you may be able

17:27.910 --> 17:29.740
to get out of this
with little jail time.

17:29.740 --> 17:31.410
I don't care
about jail time.

17:31.410 --> 17:33.920
I'm trying
to save my life.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.000
How's robbing a bank
gonna save your life?

17:36.000 --> 17:37.840
I saw a vision
of my future.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.630
My tombstone.

17:41.630 --> 17:44.760
And not just once.
I see it over and over again.

17:44.760 --> 17:46.600
It's...

17:46.600 --> 17:48.760
It's real.

17:48.760 --> 17:54.520
If I don't get what I need
from that box, I'm gonna die.

17:57.980 --> 17:59.940
He had
the Death Date Calling.

18:11.040 --> 18:13.500
No other passenger has any clue
about the Death Date.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.830
That has to be
why we're here.

18:15.830 --> 18:19.130
Maybe we don't try and stop him.
Maybe we help him.

18:19.130 --> 18:20.800
What are you talking about?
I mean, he seems to think

18:20.800 --> 18:22.300
that whatever's in that vault
is gonna save him.

18:22.300 --> 18:23.840
So maybe
it'll save us, too.

18:24.670 --> 18:26.470
You really think he has
some miracle answer

18:26.470 --> 18:27.470
for the Death Date?

18:27.470 --> 18:29.140
Why?

18:29.140 --> 18:31.850
Because, Zeke, you only have
eight months left to live.

18:31.850 --> 18:34.640
If there's even a slim chance of
saving you, I'm gonna take it.

18:34.640 --> 18:36.650
Go back.
Get on your knees.

18:36.650 --> 18:38.150
Zeke: I don't get it.

18:38.150 --> 18:40.070
You're willing to risk
everything for me now,

18:40.070 --> 18:41.900
but when I try to see you,
you blow me off.

18:41.900 --> 18:44.150
Am I just another person to save
and check off your list?

18:44.150 --> 18:45.400
No, of course not.

18:51.330 --> 18:52.490
Man: Answer the phone!

18:52.490 --> 18:55.160
No. No! No phones.

18:55.160 --> 18:57.080
Logan, it's just the cops
outside, okay?

18:57.080 --> 18:58.500
They're worried about
these hostages.

18:58.500 --> 18:59.880
They just want
to talk to you.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.420
I don't want
to talk to them.

19:03.420 --> 19:05.010
Then let me.

19:05.010 --> 19:06.420
Logan, you're not
the only one

19:06.420 --> 19:08.010
who's had
the Death Date Calling.

19:08.010 --> 19:09.510
You got to start
trusting me.

19:09.510 --> 19:10.850
Wait. Calling?

19:10.850 --> 19:12.760
You mean the vision
of my tombstone?

19:12.760 --> 19:15.180
My nephew had a vision
just like it.

19:20.730 --> 19:23.530
Ah, you st--
you stop that.

19:23.530 --> 19:25.280
You are trying
to manipulate me.

19:25.280 --> 19:27.030
Get back on the ground now!

19:27.030 --> 19:29.360
Hey, man,
believe her or not,

19:29.360 --> 19:31.200
but someone needs to calm
those cops down outside

19:31.200 --> 19:32.620
if you ever want
to get in that box.

19:39.210 --> 19:42.290
If -- If you
try anything --

19:42.290 --> 19:44.710
No, look,
we'll make a deal.

19:44.710 --> 19:47.720
We release the hostages, and
they'll open the vault for you.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.220
We can do that,
can't we?

19:51.970 --> 19:54.720
If you're worried about losing
bodies and losing leverage,

19:54.720 --> 19:55.640
I'll stay, too.

19:55.640 --> 19:56.930
Zeke, no.

19:56.930 --> 19:58.480
No chance
I'm leaving you behind.

20:01.730 --> 20:02.730
Logan, stop.

20:02.730 --> 20:03.730
Please.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.570
Answer it.

20:18.580 --> 20:20.830
This is
Detective Michaela Stone.

20:23.170 --> 20:27.840
I filled out the profile,
even uploaded a picture.

20:27.840 --> 20:29.420
I think I am
finally ready

20:29.420 --> 20:31.510
to dive into
the online-dating world.

20:31.510 --> 20:33.010
Good for you.

20:33.010 --> 20:35.930
I'm glad to see you so excited
about the future.

20:35.930 --> 20:37.770
I'd be more excited
about my future

20:37.770 --> 20:39.680
if I can get some help
with my work.

20:39.680 --> 20:41.600
Oh?

20:41.600 --> 20:45.770
Remember the genetic research
I'd been working on?

20:45.770 --> 20:48.110
Vaguely.

20:48.110 --> 20:49.610
Well,
I've hit a roadblock.

20:49.610 --> 20:51.860
But I heard that there's
a geneticist in Sweden

20:51.860 --> 20:53.870
having success
with experimental studies

20:53.870 --> 20:55.120
in the same arena, so --

20:55.120 --> 20:57.160
And you think
they can help?

20:57.160 --> 20:59.040
It's the most promising
lead I've had

20:59.040 --> 21:00.540
since I've started
all this.

21:05.290 --> 21:06.880
Time's up.

21:06.880 --> 21:09.460
That went by
really fast.

21:09.460 --> 21:12.800
Guess I'll have to wait
till next time to hear more.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.140
Sounds good.

21:17.640 --> 21:19.850
Man: Hands up.
One at a time.

21:19.850 --> 21:21.310
Stay calm...

21:21.310 --> 21:24.230
Everyone's out
except for the three of us.

21:24.230 --> 21:26.190
I have the situation
under control.

21:26.190 --> 21:27.860
What's taking so long?

21:27.860 --> 21:29.820
You said they were gonna
open this thing.

21:29.820 --> 21:32.740
Accessing the vault remotely
takes time.

21:32.740 --> 21:34.990
There are many layers of --
Enough!

21:48.090 --> 21:49.050
Come on.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.210
Come on, come on.
Come on.

21:52.420 --> 21:54.340
No, we just need
to be patient.

21:54.340 --> 21:57.050
We're not gonna wait out here
for the situation to get worse.

21:57.050 --> 21:59.010
You're on a short leash,
Detective.

22:02.430 --> 22:04.350
Detective Jared Vasquez,
NYPD.

22:04.350 --> 22:06.100
What's the situation
inside?

22:06.100 --> 22:08.060
Got things under control here,
Detective.

22:08.060 --> 22:09.860
Look, I heard over the scanner
one of our own's trapped inside.

22:09.860 --> 22:11.400
Michaela Stone.

22:11.400 --> 22:13.530
Your colleague seems to think
she has it all figured out

22:13.530 --> 22:15.360
because the gunman
was on Flight 828 with her.

22:15.360 --> 22:17.070
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait.

22:17.070 --> 22:18.530
The gunman's
a passenger?

22:18.530 --> 22:19.780
Logan Strickland.

22:19.780 --> 22:21.540
And if Detective Stone
isn't careful,

22:21.540 --> 22:23.750
her comfort with him
is gonna get her hurt.

22:33.550 --> 22:34.970
Guess we're in
the right place.

22:34.970 --> 22:37.260
Now we just need to figure out
why we're here.

22:43.730 --> 22:44.730
Hold up.

22:47.060 --> 22:48.900
This is how you saw it,
right,

22:48.900 --> 22:51.610
the crest with the year
right below?

22:51.610 --> 22:55.490
Does it feel this big every time
you chase down a Calling?

22:55.490 --> 22:56.570
Every time.

22:57.740 --> 22:58.990
I'll go find
the 2012 champions.

22:58.990 --> 23:00.070
Alright.

23:02.790 --> 23:05.250
Hey.

23:05.250 --> 23:07.250
What do you know
about Logan Strickland?

23:07.250 --> 23:08.250
Uh, not much.

23:08.250 --> 23:09.830
Uh, he was on Flight 828,

23:09.830 --> 23:12.920
but I haven't been able
to track him down. Why?

23:12.920 --> 23:15.800
He's holding up a bank
right now, but Mick's inside.

23:15.800 --> 23:17.180
Wait. What?

23:17.180 --> 23:19.510
I-Is she o-okay?
Has anyone talked to her?

23:19.510 --> 23:22.350
She's holding her own.
She keeps talking ESU back.

23:22.350 --> 23:24.270
I'm worried she's in
over her head in there.

23:24.270 --> 23:26.810
Alright, I'm on my way.
Uh, text me the address.

23:26.810 --> 23:28.810
TJ, I need to go.

23:28.810 --> 23:29.850
What should I do?

23:29.850 --> 23:31.190
Find the 2012 champions,

23:31.190 --> 23:32.440
track them down,
and I'll call you later.

23:32.440 --> 23:33.780
Well, I found them.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.610
The winners were Frank
and Logan Strickland.

23:42.700 --> 23:44.950
Ben: Oh, my God.
Logan Strickland.

23:44.950 --> 23:46.620
He's holding up a bank
right now.

23:46.620 --> 23:48.620
Michaela's inside.

23:48.620 --> 23:49.960
That's why we're here.

23:49.960 --> 23:51.380
The Calling wouldn't
bring us all this way

23:51.380 --> 23:52.840
just to look at a photo.

24:07.310 --> 24:09.140
Frank Strickland?

24:14.980 --> 24:16.990
Logan: All the way back.
In the corner.

24:16.990 --> 24:18.530
Corner.

24:18.530 --> 24:20.660
Open Frank Strickland's
safety deposit box.

24:22.320 --> 24:23.830
Who's Frank Strickland?

24:25.740 --> 24:27.540
Zeke: After everything
she's done for you,

24:27.540 --> 24:29.210
you don't think
you owe her an answer?

24:32.330 --> 24:34.000
He's my brother.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.840
If he's your brother, then why
did you just hold up a bank?

24:36.840 --> 24:38.510
Why didn't you
just talk to him?

24:38.510 --> 24:40.680
You don't think
that I tried?

24:40.680 --> 24:42.180
He wouldn't listen.

24:42.180 --> 24:44.550
He thinks that everyone
who returned on 828,

24:44.550 --> 24:46.600
that they're
not really them.

24:46.600 --> 24:47.890
What do you mean?

24:47.890 --> 24:49.770
He doesn't believe I'm me.

24:49.770 --> 24:51.850
I don't exist.

24:51.850 --> 24:56.520
And everything that belonged
to me, that was my birthright,

24:56.520 --> 25:00.530
everything that our dad,
may he rest in peace,

25:00.530 --> 25:06.240
was saving for me,
Frank took it all.

25:06.240 --> 25:09.450
I was terrified,
but he didn't care.

25:13.710 --> 25:15.710
I'm his brother,
but he didn't care.

25:17.550 --> 25:19.460
I found
Mr. Strickland's box.

25:26.100 --> 25:27.220
Open it.

25:27.220 --> 25:28.890
I-I-I can't.

25:28.890 --> 25:32.730
I only have my key.
I need the owner's key, too.

25:32.730 --> 25:34.270
Are you kidding me?

25:34.270 --> 25:35.730
Oh, boy.

25:35.730 --> 25:37.770
You --

25:39.230 --> 25:41.900
You don't have some kind
of a master key?!

25:41.900 --> 25:43.990
What -- What --
What if the owner dies?

25:43.990 --> 25:45.620
Then what?!
I need the second key.

25:45.620 --> 25:46.780
The hell you do!

25:46.780 --> 25:47.780
Logan, Logan,
put the gun down.

25:47.780 --> 25:49.290
No! No!

25:49.290 --> 25:51.450
This is not the way
this is supposed to happen!

25:53.830 --> 25:54.920
Stop!

25:54.920 --> 25:56.420
Aah!

26:00.090 --> 26:01.920
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

26:01.920 --> 26:04.510
Let me take him outside,
get him to the EMTs.

26:05.340 --> 26:07.510
I'll come right back.
You'll still have your hostage.

26:08.930 --> 26:10.930
How do I know
you're not gonna leave?

26:10.930 --> 26:12.640
Because she's still here.

26:14.350 --> 26:15.600
Here. Put this.

26:17.770 --> 26:19.940
Okay. Okay.

26:19.940 --> 26:21.990
Okay, alright.
I got to tie it on.

26:21.990 --> 26:23.780
Here, let me
loosen your tie.

26:26.780 --> 26:28.990
My name is Ben Stone.
I was on Flight 828.

26:28.990 --> 26:31.040
I need to talk to you
about your brother Logan.

26:31.040 --> 26:35.160
He's holding up a bank
in Seaside right at this moment.

26:35.160 --> 26:37.210
That's not possible.
My brother's dead.

26:37.210 --> 26:38.880
He died on that plane.

26:38.880 --> 26:42.170
You know that's not true.
That plane returned.

26:42.170 --> 26:44.130
We were both on that flight,
Frank.

26:45.340 --> 26:47.340
Then I guess
you're dead, too.

26:47.340 --> 26:48.800
Frank, please.

26:48.800 --> 26:50.350
Logan is holding
my sister hostage.

26:50.350 --> 26:51.390
I need you
to talk him down.

26:51.390 --> 26:52.720
My brother's gone.

26:52.720 --> 26:54.310
Stop saying the 828 passengers
are dead.

26:54.310 --> 26:55.350
We're standing
right here.

26:55.350 --> 26:56.890
How can you really be you?

26:56.890 --> 26:58.190
Logan didn't age.

26:58.190 --> 27:01.070
He had these crazy visions,
heard voices,

27:01.070 --> 27:04.490
constantly saying
that he was gonna die again.

27:04.490 --> 27:06.150
He thought
he was gonna die?

27:06.150 --> 27:08.240
He said he kept seeing
his own tombstone.

27:08.240 --> 27:09.490
He was obsessed with it.

27:09.490 --> 27:10.870
He had
a Death Date Calling.

27:10.870 --> 27:12.370
What?
It's real.

27:12.370 --> 27:14.040
Frank, the passengers
are gonna die.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.500
You're just as insane
as he is.

27:15.500 --> 27:17.040
No, no, no.
Wait a minute.

27:17.040 --> 27:18.920
I wish it wasn't true,
but it is.

27:18.920 --> 27:20.330
I've seen it.

27:20.330 --> 27:22.380
So has my sister
and my son.

27:22.380 --> 27:26.170
We are going to die
on June 2, 2024.

27:26.170 --> 27:28.260
What?

27:28.260 --> 27:30.390
TJ, I-I didn't mean for you
to find out like this.

27:30.390 --> 27:32.850
I promise.
But I'm working on a solution.
I got to go.

27:32.850 --> 27:34.100
TJ.

27:34.100 --> 27:37.190
Did you say
June 2, 2024?

27:37.190 --> 27:39.190
As in 6224?

27:39.190 --> 27:42.360
Yeah. Does that
mean something to you?

27:42.360 --> 27:43.780
Logan's vision.

27:43.780 --> 27:46.440
I think I know why
he's holding up that bank.

27:46.440 --> 27:49.200
He wants the key
to my safety deposit box.

27:56.370 --> 27:57.370
Good news.

27:57.370 --> 27:58.790
What's going on?

27:58.790 --> 28:00.880
We picked this up
from the Major's office

28:00.880 --> 28:02.090
just after your session.

28:03.210 --> 28:05.380
Ellen:
There's been a development.

28:05.380 --> 28:07.470
We're a go, immediately.

28:07.470 --> 28:09.470
Sent from
a classified comm line.

28:09.470 --> 28:10.720
She bought the lie.

28:10.720 --> 28:12.640
A meet-up would be
the next step.

28:12.640 --> 28:13.810
We'll be there.

28:13.810 --> 28:15.140
In which case,
we got them?

28:15.140 --> 28:17.060
We just might have.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.610
Mick!
Mick, put your hands up!

28:30.610 --> 28:32.820
Don't shoot!
He's wounded!

28:32.820 --> 28:34.740
Whoa, whoa. Stand down.
That's not the gunman.

28:34.740 --> 28:36.290
Stand down.

28:36.290 --> 28:38.160
I'm gonna leave him here
and go back inside.

28:38.160 --> 28:40.460
You are not
going back inside.

28:40.460 --> 28:42.420
Then I guess you're gonna
have to shoot me.

28:48.590 --> 28:51.510
Ben: Jared! Jared!

28:51.510 --> 28:53.800
This is the gunman's brother.
He's got the key.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.470
No, get these civilians
out of here.

28:55.470 --> 28:57.430
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

28:57.430 --> 28:59.270
We can end this peacefully
right now.

28:59.270 --> 29:01.600
Just let him see his brother.
Let Frank give him the key.

29:03.520 --> 29:06.940
Come on!
Come on! Come on!

29:06.940 --> 29:08.110
Never get it open.

29:08.110 --> 29:09.440
I have to.

29:09.440 --> 29:11.860
There's no other way.
Come on.

29:13.450 --> 29:15.160
Logan.

29:15.160 --> 29:17.660
I'll contact ESU,
see if we can buy more time.

29:23.170 --> 29:26.460
Don't come in here!

29:26.460 --> 29:27.960
Stay out there!

29:27.960 --> 29:29.380
Frank:
Logan, it's me.

29:36.180 --> 29:37.970
For God's sake, Logan.

29:37.970 --> 29:39.390
None of this
would've happened

29:39.390 --> 29:40.980
if you had just
given me the key.

29:40.980 --> 29:43.640
But a gun?
Hostages?

29:43.640 --> 29:45.900
How could you?
How could you?!

29:45.900 --> 29:48.820
You abandoned me.

29:48.820 --> 29:52.320
My own brother told me
that I wasn't a human being.

29:54.820 --> 29:56.660
I didn't understand.

29:56.660 --> 29:59.580
Come on, Logan.
Please, give me the gun.

30:03.080 --> 30:04.330
Come --

30:07.080 --> 30:08.380
Come on.

30:17.260 --> 30:18.890
Michaela:
Let them finish.

30:22.850 --> 30:24.850
It's me, Frank.

30:27.190 --> 30:28.400
It's me.

30:30.940 --> 30:33.190
And I don't want to die.

31:22.330 --> 31:24.830
I haven't held this
in 10 years.

31:28.830 --> 31:30.790
Give it to me.

31:30.790 --> 31:32.590
I don't understand.
Just take it.

31:32.590 --> 31:35.920
No, Dad passed it on to you.
You have to pass it on to me.

31:38.630 --> 31:39.840
Please.

31:42.930 --> 31:44.850
Is this part
of the magic cure-all?

31:44.850 --> 31:46.140
I don't know.

31:52.150 --> 31:55.440
It's yours.
It was always yours.

32:12.880 --> 32:14.800
"Bring him back."

32:14.800 --> 32:16.840
It wasn't about Logan.
It was about his brother.

32:16.840 --> 32:18.840
At least with whatever time
he does have left,

32:18.840 --> 32:21.010
he won't be alone.

32:21.010 --> 32:22.800
Plenty of company
at Rikers.

32:24.390 --> 32:26.390
Could you?
Just for a second?

32:26.390 --> 32:27.850
Yeah, uncuff him.

32:32.150 --> 32:34.860
Everyone in
my grandfather's platoon died

32:34.860 --> 32:37.490
when they stormed
Normandy.

32:37.490 --> 32:39.650
Everyone but him.

32:39.650 --> 32:43.990
This compass caught the bullet
that was meant to end his life.

32:43.990 --> 32:45.370
He gave it to my dad.

32:45.370 --> 32:47.830
Saved him from
a pulmonary embolism.

32:47.830 --> 32:49.540
Now it's mine.

32:49.540 --> 32:51.330
It'll save me, too.

32:53.830 --> 32:56.170
I can't exactly take it
where I'm going.

32:58.260 --> 33:01.550
I'd like you to hold on to it
for me while I'm away.

33:02.890 --> 33:05.510
Maybe it'll help save
all the other passengers, too.

33:27.030 --> 33:30.750
My portion of the Death Date
Calling was a peacock.

33:30.750 --> 33:32.210
It was the first step

33:32.210 --> 33:34.880
in understanding
we were going to die.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.710
Well, maybe this is
the first step

33:36.710 --> 33:38.460
in figuring out
how we survive.

33:39.760 --> 33:42.260
I can't believe the Calling
brought you here.

33:42.260 --> 33:44.050
The Calling
led me to Frank.

33:44.050 --> 33:45.720
Jared brought me here.

33:49.390 --> 33:50.600
Safety deposit box.

33:50.600 --> 33:52.060
6224.

33:54.730 --> 33:57.060
We're gonna do this,
Mick.

33:57.060 --> 34:01.110
I don't know how,
but we're gonna crack it.

34:01.110 --> 34:02.570
Together.

34:04.280 --> 34:06.160
Yeah. Yeah, we are.

34:18.130 --> 34:19.840
Give us a sec.

34:25.260 --> 34:26.760
Thank you.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.850
I didn't do anything.
Yeah, you did.

34:28.850 --> 34:31.810
You vouched for me.
You called Ben.

34:31.810 --> 34:35.020
You didn't have to.
You probably shouldn't have.

34:35.020 --> 34:37.270
But...

34:37.270 --> 34:38.940
you had my back.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.960
Let's go
get that looked at.

35:10.890 --> 35:14.640
That was literally
the longest class of all time.

35:17.310 --> 35:19.810
Hi.

35:19.810 --> 35:22.070
Hey.

35:22.070 --> 35:25.320
So, your dad just chases down
these Callings,

35:25.320 --> 35:28.700
always believing
he can solve them somehow?

35:28.700 --> 35:31.160
It's like you've
known him forever.

35:31.160 --> 35:33.990
You think he can solve the one
about the passengers dying?

35:36.540 --> 35:38.330
Wait.

35:38.330 --> 35:40.710
My dad told you
about the Death Date?

35:43.590 --> 35:46.170
Any thoughts on how
we can stop it, SAT girl?

35:52.260 --> 35:56.930
Maybe we could use the tesseract
to move through space and time.

35:56.930 --> 35:58.600
"A Wrinkle in Time."

36:02.440 --> 36:04.230
That was you.

36:04.230 --> 36:06.190
So you do
remember me.

36:08.200 --> 36:10.410
My dad's a great guy,

36:10.410 --> 36:14.370
but...he gets obsessed,

36:14.370 --> 36:17.870
like he did
with my brother's cancer,

36:17.870 --> 36:20.710
like he's doing
with the Callings.

36:20.710 --> 36:24.960
He just always needs a solution,
an answer.

36:24.960 --> 36:26.880
I guess that's why
he's a math guy.

36:29.880 --> 36:33.220
Yeah, but...

36:33.220 --> 36:37.390
this constant need
to be in control of everything,

36:37.390 --> 36:40.310
that comes
from a place of fear.

36:40.310 --> 36:43.560
We need to approach
this supposed Death Date

36:43.560 --> 36:45.940
from a place of hope.

36:45.940 --> 36:49.400
How can we possibly
do that?

36:49.400 --> 36:50.900
Let me show you.

37:04.420 --> 37:08.340
Yo, Saanvi,
even though I'm no longer

37:08.340 --> 37:12.640
on your proverbial payroll,
I thought some dinner might...

37:12.640 --> 37:13.930
What the...

37:57.140 --> 37:59.140
Hey.

37:59.140 --> 38:00.180
Hey.

38:03.310 --> 38:06.060
I'm glad Mick is okay.

38:06.060 --> 38:07.980
I'm glad you were there
with her.

38:11.150 --> 38:13.650
You were right.

38:13.650 --> 38:16.320
I am gonna fight like hell

38:16.320 --> 38:19.330
to make sure we're all
at Olive's wedding.

38:19.330 --> 38:23.210
Good answer, because
I'm counting on a dance

38:23.210 --> 38:25.330
with the father
of the bride.

39:02.080 --> 39:04.200
Afraid you missed
last call.

39:05.910 --> 39:08.540
You got plans?

39:08.540 --> 39:11.130
What do you have in mind?

39:11.130 --> 39:14.210
How about we go
not have that dinner?

39:25.930 --> 39:27.730
You okay?

39:27.730 --> 39:31.150
I mean, apart from
this head wound.

39:31.150 --> 39:32.440
Why?

39:32.440 --> 39:34.940
Why are you always trying
to save me?

39:37.240 --> 39:39.450
Because, Zeke,
you're a good man.

39:39.450 --> 39:41.910
Whether you
believe it or not.

39:41.910 --> 39:45.450
You'll come around.
I know that.

39:45.450 --> 39:47.830
All I've got
is eight months.

39:47.830 --> 39:49.080
Don't say that.

39:49.080 --> 39:51.090
This compass,
it could be a clue,

39:51.090 --> 39:54.460
and we will find a way
to really save you.

39:54.460 --> 39:56.510
But you already have.

40:05.270 --> 40:08.940
"A good heart
goes a long way."

Emmett:
It's empty, sir.

41:29.060 --> 41:31.560
See what nearby cameras
picked up.

41:40.030 --> 41:43.360
Sometimes covering up a tell
is the tell.

41:43.360 --> 41:45.280
This isn't on you.

41:45.280 --> 41:47.030
We were David.

41:47.030 --> 41:49.620
She was Goliath.

41:49.620 --> 41:51.540
She took my work.

41:51.540 --> 41:54.370
She took everything.

41:54.370 --> 41:56.790
It -- It was just
dummy test work.

41:56.790 --> 41:58.880
I had to keep up
my research,

41:58.880 --> 42:00.880
so I created a secret lab
at home.

42:03.630 --> 42:05.390
Well, you fooled me.

42:05.390 --> 42:08.470
Vance, I think I figured out
how to control the 828 anomaly,

42:08.470 --> 42:11.220
how to isolate it, eliminate it,
and replicate it,

42:11.220 --> 42:12.940
and now the Major
knows it all.
