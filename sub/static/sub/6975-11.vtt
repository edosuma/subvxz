what you told me before.

Yes, sir. Agent Mulder

You said on the phone
Agent Mulder was investigating

04:12.966 --> 04:15.264
a missing woman,
Marie Hangemuhl.

04:15.302 --> 04:17.327
Well, she wasn't
exactly missing.

investigating, either.

04:22.007 --> 04:23.805
It was a false report.

04:23.877 --> 04:25.674
Marie never even
left the house.

04:25.745 --> 04:28.680
The only reason Agent Mulder
found out about it was

04:28.715 --> 04:31.741
because Marie's sister got
all excited about nothing.

04:31.818 --> 04:35.276
There.

04:35.355 --> 04:36.788
See for yourself.

Agent Doggett

04:46.166 --> 04:48.066
what's your interest?

04:48.134 --> 04:49.761
I mean, I was
actually surprised

04:49.836 --> 04:51.997
that one FBI agent gave
this case a thought.

04:52.072 --> 04:55.371
It's not so much the case
as it is the agent.

04:55.609 --> 04:57.941
Agent Mulder disappeared
last May.

04:58.011 --> 04:59.137
Sorry to hear that.

04:59.212 --> 05:01.271
I still don't see what
that has to do with us.

05:01.348 --> 05:03.111
Did Agent Mulder have
a personal connection here--

05:03.183 --> 05:04.741
something that might not be
in your report?

05:04.818 --> 05:06.149
No, I don't think

05:06.219 --> 05:08.744
he'd ever been to Squamash
before, as far as I know.

05:08.788 --> 05:10.312
I have cell phone records
showing that

05:10.390 --> 05:12.984

the week before he disappeared.

some questions.

05:41.655 --> 05:43.885

a minute?

He wants to ask us
a few questions.

05:54.801 --> 05:56.200

Come on, Kurt.

way out of proportion.

her to worry.

coming here.

07:04.037 --> 07:06.198
And I think maybe it still is.

07:06.272 --> 07:07.500
We had a fiight.

08:04.831 --> 08:05.957
Was this Mulder guy sick?

08:05.999 --> 08:08.797
Sick in the head,
I mean?

08:08.868 --> 08:10.358
Is that why you're checking
into this?

08:10.436 --> 08:13.872
What stories, Mr. Hangemuhl?

08:13.940 --> 08:15.339
An Indian folk legend

08:15.375 --> 08:18.469
about a creature who lives
out in the woods.

08:18.545 --> 08:21.173
I've heard these stories
since I was a kid.

08:21.247 --> 08:22.509
So your colleague
twisted it

08:22.582 --> 08:25.312
into a theory that she was going
to disappear, all right

08:25.385 --> 08:26.579
'cause this creature was

08:26.820 --> 08:28.082
coming to eat her.

08:29.489 --> 08:30.820
Eat her?

08:30.890 --> 08:32.517

08:44.003 --> 08:45.595
No, I don't think so. Why?

08:45.839 --> 08:47.272

10:53.967 --> 10:55.935
That's what
I'm here to fiind out.

11:16.089 --> 11:20.185
Were you aware Mulder carried
a second weapon, a Walther PPK?

11:20.259 --> 11:21.624
Yeah, in an
ankle holster.

11:21.694 --> 11:23.628
I found it hidden
under his sink.

11:23.696 --> 11:25.561
The clip was three rounds shy.

11:27.100 --> 11:28.124
What's this about?

11:28.201 --> 11:30.066
Three shots
were fiired in a house

11:30.103 --> 11:32.401
where Mulder investigated
a case last May.

11:32.472 --> 11:34.440
He never fiiled
a report on the case

11:34.507 --> 11:36.236
or the discharge
of his weapon.

11:36.309 --> 11:37.708
Do you know any reason why?

11:37.777 --> 11:40.575
If Mulder did these things,
he would've reported them.

11:40.613 --> 11:43.104
Mulder submitted
case reports, all right

11:43.182 --> 11:45.673
but they indicate
he was here in Washington

11:45.752 --> 11:49.483
on days his cell phone records
prove he was in Pennsylvania.

11:49.555 --> 11:51.750
Are you calling Mulder a liar?

11:54.093 --> 11:56.061
This is the muzzle
of Mulder's pistol.

11:56.129 --> 11:57.323
You see that there?

12:00.199 --> 12:01.131
It's blowback.

of dried blood

12:02.802 --> 12:04.531
in a semi-circular pattern.

12:04.604 --> 12:07.801
Which indicates Mulder fiired
close-range at something

12:08.041 --> 12:09.065

12:09.142 --> 12:10.302
I've heard enough.

made himself disappear?

the morning after Mulder
saw the Hangemuhls.

16:47.553 --> 16:50.522
Okay, so I didn't make
the connection. So what?

16:50.556 --> 16:53.957
Three rounds were missing
from Mulder's weapon.

16:56.896 --> 17:00.559
So Mulder came back
to town to kill this man

17:00.633 --> 17:02.624
and now the Hangemuhls
are lying about it.

17:02.702 --> 17:03.600
Maybe I am, too.

17:03.669 --> 17:05.432
Pretty much.

17:05.503 --> 17:06.835

17:09.608 --> 17:10.905
Where's the evidence?

him capable of doing.

42:22.954 --> 42:24.979
You want some free advice?

42:25.056 --> 42:26.523
Don't write that report.

42:28.926 --> 42:31.486
You turn that in

42:31.562 --> 42:35.054
you open up a world
of trouble for Agent Scully.

42:35.099 --> 42:36.361
And yourself.

42:36.434 --> 42:38.299
She didn't know anything
about this, sir.

42:38.369 --> 42:39.597
Of that I'm certain.

42:39.837 --> 42:42.863
How many months
will be lost proving that?

42:42.940 --> 42:45.465
How much damage done
to her good name?

42:45.543 --> 42:48.205
And Mulder's?

42:48.279 --> 42:50.304
And to yours?

42:50.381 --> 42:51.973
For what?

42:52.049 --> 42:53.641
The truth.

43:02.126 --> 43:03.388
You and I both know

43:03.461 --> 43:06.294
what happened
out there, Agent Doggett.

43:09.500 --> 43:11.297
No one else needs to.

44:28.145 --> 44:29.947
[ Child ]
I made this.
