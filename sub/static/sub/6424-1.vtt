He couldn't be faithful
for five minutes.

So when he makes a promise,

1:57:11.561 --> 1:57:13.620
it doesn't mean what it means
when you make a promise...

1:57:16.332 --> 1:57:20.325
He has so many realities, Dickie,
and he believes them all.

1:57:20.403 --> 1:57:23.600
He lies. He lies.

1:57:23.673 --> 1:57:28.076
And that's his-- Half the time
he doesn't even realize he's doing it.

1:57:28.144 --> 1:57:31.443
And today,

1:57:31.514 --> 1:57:35.314
I really started wondering whether
he may have killed Freddie.

1:57:35.385 --> 1:57:38.980

if anybody would contradict him.

to ask Mr. Greenleaf.
