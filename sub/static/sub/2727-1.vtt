01:29:05.570 --> 01:29:08.900
it was the museum
and one of those meetings

01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:13.430
that kept you
from driving that day.

01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:19.680
And if you went back,
it'd mean you weren't sorry,

01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:24.150
you weren't wrong
and you'd be
betraying your children.

01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:29.220
She called you crazy,
and l called her
a soulless bitch!

01:29:29.290 --> 01:29:30.720
And l hung up!

01:29:30.790 --> 01:29:32.780
That didn't go very well!

01:29:38.170 --> 01:29:40.500
What's true in our minds
is true.

01:29:41.870 --> 01:29:44.310
Whether some people
know it or not.

01:29:46.210 --> 01:29:49.270
That's when l realized
l'm part of the problem.

01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:52.740
Not because l remind you.

01:29:54.750 --> 01:29:57.080
But, because
l couldn't join you.

01:29:58.590 --> 01:30:00.350
So l left you alone.

01:30:08.430 --> 01:30:10.190
Don't give up, okay?

01:30:22.810 --> 01:30:23.900
Okay.

01:30:25.450 --> 01:30:26.540
Okay.

01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:29.650
lt's okay.

01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:49.040
ANNIE: So you reconciled?

01:30:52.610 --> 01:30:54.410
That's very romantic.

01:30:56.950 --> 01:30:58.940
She still killed herself.

01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:01.980
ln the end,
she gave up.

01:31:02.150 --> 01:31:03.450
There's nothing
wrong with it.

01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:04.780
Her husband thought so.

01:31:04.850 --> 01:31:06.450
He was a coward!

01:31:07.290 --> 01:31:09.480
Being strong,
not giving up,

01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:12.450
that was his place to hide.

01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:15.860
He pushed away
the pain so hard,

01:31:16.130 --> 01:31:19.690
he disconnected himself
from the person
he loved the most.

01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:25.510
Sometimes,
when you win, you lose.

01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:35.910
When he saw
his children again...

01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:38.620
l thought
your children were dead.

01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:42.350
You can see the dead.

01:31:42.490 --> 01:31:44.980
ln your dreams.
lf you want to.

01:31:49.330 --> 01:31:51.090
l wanna see Christy.

01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:54.960
l can show you.

01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:56.530
lt's not hard.

01:31:57.210 --> 01:31:58.540
All you have to do...

01:31:58.610 --> 01:32:00.340
it's like painting a picture.

01:32:00.410 --> 01:32:02.070
We do it together.

01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:05.080
Just close your eyes.

01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:08.670
Please don't be afraid.

01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:14.690
Remember where
you were married?

01:32:21.730 --> 01:32:22.960
Christy!

01:32:23.730 --> 01:32:25.060
Christy...

01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:30.130
Who else would you
be marrying in your dreams?

01:32:32.510 --> 01:32:34.170
l missed you so.

01:32:37.010 --> 01:32:38.240
Annie...

01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:40.820
This is real.

01:32:44.290 --> 01:32:46.150
The man in the garden.

01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:51.760
lt's me.

01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:56.420
No!

01:32:56.700 --> 01:32:57.860
No!

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.940
Whoever you are,

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.730
did you think
you could take him from me?

01:33:19.690 --> 01:33:21.280
l'm sorry, babe.

01:33:22.090 --> 01:33:23.720
There's some things
l have to say.

01:33:24.430 --> 01:33:26.220
l've only got
a few moments left.

01:33:29.930 --> 01:33:33.270
l'm sorry for all the things
l'll never give you.

01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:37.560
l'll never buy you another
meatball sub
with extra sauce.

01:33:38.370 --> 01:33:40.270
That was a big one.

01:33:42.110 --> 01:33:44.140
l'll never make you smile.

01:33:46.980 --> 01:33:49.470
l just wanted us
to be old together.

01:33:50.590 --> 01:33:54.490
Two old farts laughing
at each other
as our bodies fell apart.

01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:57.320
Together at the end.

01:33:57.490 --> 01:33:59.690
By that lake
in your painting.

01:34:00.730 --> 01:34:02.720
That was our heaven, see?

01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:06.530
There's lots of things
to miss.

01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:10.330
Books, naps,

01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:15.100
kisses...and fights.

01:34:16.010 --> 01:34:18.310
Oh, God,
we had some great ones!

01:34:19.550 --> 01:34:21.350
Thank you for those.

01:34:23.690 --> 01:34:25.880
Thank you for every kindness.

01:34:28.290 --> 01:34:30.380
Thank you for our children.

01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:33.360
For the first time l saw them.

01:34:35.130 --> 01:34:38.690
Thank you for being someone
l was always proud
to be with.

01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:43.330
For your guts,

01:34:44.010 --> 01:34:45.730
for your sweetness.

01:34:46.710 --> 01:34:50.040
For how you always looked,
for how l always wanted
to touch you.

01:34:53.010 --> 01:34:54.880
God, you were my life.

01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:00.620
l apologize for every time
l failed you.

01:35:02.190 --> 01:35:03.950
Especially this one.

01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:29.380
Didn't you think
l'd make it?

01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:31.550
You were in there a while.

01:35:31.890 --> 01:35:34.150
Took me a while to realize
you were right.

01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:37.460
Nothing you can do
could help her.

01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:40.230
This trip was for you.

01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:44.590
Did you come close...

01:35:44.670 --> 01:35:46.220
To losing it?

01:35:46.670 --> 01:35:47.930
Oh, yeah.

01:35:48.970 --> 01:35:51.100
Pushed it right to the edge.

01:35:52.770 --> 01:35:54.800
That's why
l had to come out now.

01:35:54.980 --> 01:35:56.710
l'm giving up.

01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:01.950
Not the way you think.

01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:07.920
Go home, Al.

01:36:09.490 --> 01:36:12.080
Will you tell my children
l love them?

01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:16.090
And l won't
leave their mother.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.200
Thanks.

01:36:29.710 --> 01:36:31.470
Where are we headed?

01:36:33.250 --> 01:36:35.440
ln one minute
l won't know you

01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:37.980
any better
than you'll know me.

01:36:40.050 --> 01:36:41.920
But we'll be together.

01:36:43.190 --> 01:36:44.780
Where we belong.

01:36:46.890 --> 01:36:48.490
Good people go to hell

01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:51.160
because they can't
forgive themselves.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.520
l know l can't.

01:36:54.670 --> 01:36:56.540
But l can forgive you.

01:36:57.810 --> 01:36:59.770
For killing my children?

01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:03.240
And my sweet husband?

01:37:04.810 --> 01:37:05.870
No.

01:37:07.010 --> 01:37:10.380
For being so wonderful,
a guy would choose hell
over heaven,

01:37:10.490 --> 01:37:12.450
just to hang around you.

01:37:18.490 --> 01:37:20.590
Not because l remind you,

01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:23.990
but because
l couldn't join you.

01:37:25.300 --> 01:37:27.200
Sorry l left you alone.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.770
Don't give up, okay?

01:37:52.130 --> 01:37:53.360
Christy?

01:37:59.370 --> 01:38:00.630
Christy.

01:38:05.010 --> 01:38:07.130
What happened to this place?

01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:12.110
lt's cold.

01:38:12.910 --> 01:38:14.250
(CREAKING)

01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:17.820
(CRACKING)

01:38:25.590 --> 01:38:26.820
Christy?

01:38:27.730 --> 01:38:30.430
God, no! No, no, no, no!

01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:33.260
Don't give up!
Don't give up! Christy!

01:38:33.330 --> 01:38:36.330
Don't give up!
Don't, don't give up!

01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:37.870
Christy!

01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:44.310
(FADING)
Christy, don't give up...

01:39:06.330 --> 01:39:07.560
Christy.

01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:18.470
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:45.300
Hey!

01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:49.840
Remember me?

01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:02.790
Sometimes, when you lose

01:40:04.030 --> 01:40:05.250
you win.

01:41:00.450 --> 01:41:02.210
How did we get here?

01:41:06.220 --> 01:41:08.710
Travel here
is like everything else.

01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:11.620
lt's in your mind.

01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:15.890
You only have to
close your eyes.

01:41:17.300 --> 01:41:19.630
lf you know
where you're going...

01:41:21.300 --> 01:41:23.070
Looks like we did.

01:41:25.610 --> 01:41:27.230
Where you were...

01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:31.710
l tried everything.
Nothing worked.

01:41:33.450 --> 01:41:34.540
Until

01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:38.050
you tried joining me.

01:41:44.060 --> 01:41:46.490
What some folks
call impossible...

01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:49.490
is what
they haven't seen before.

01:42:32.470 --> 01:42:34.460
TRACKER: Excuse me, lady.

01:42:36.510 --> 01:42:38.950
Ready for that surprise
l promised?

01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:40.870
Yeah.

01:42:44.620 --> 01:42:46.590
That's not the surprise!

01:42:47.290 --> 01:42:48.450
Mommy?

01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:40.240
ANNIE: l want us to
grow old together.

01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:42.440
Can we do that here?
Mmm-hmm.

01:43:43.580 --> 01:43:45.070
l want it all.

01:43:46.250 --> 01:43:48.240
As long as it's with you.

01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:50.050
lt will be.

01:43:54.220 --> 01:43:56.250
But what about going back?

01:43:57.490 --> 01:43:58.960
Being reborn?

01:44:00.260 --> 01:44:02.960
That's the one thing
we can't have here.

01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:07.160
Finding each other
all over again.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:09.600
Falling in love.

01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:13.740
Make different choices.

01:44:19.010 --> 01:44:20.040
Try again.

01:44:20.180 --> 01:44:21.270
Yeah.

01:44:21.820 --> 01:44:23.580
Avoid sharp objects.

01:44:26.850 --> 01:44:28.190
Don't worry about the kids.

01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:29.950
They'll be here.

01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:31.750
They want us to go.

01:44:33.090 --> 01:44:35.690
A human life
is just a heartbeat here.

01:44:36.430 --> 01:44:37.830
And we'll all be together.

01:44:37.900 --> 01:44:39.130
Forever.
