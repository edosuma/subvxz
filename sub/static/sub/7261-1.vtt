Hello, I'm Falafel, maître d' dungeon.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.612
Please allow me to show
you to your cell. Come.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.410
Duck.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.453
I always forget about that.

05:29.538 --> 05:32.915
I'm so sorry, but we cannot seat
you without the proper attire.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.459
See?

05:37.379 --> 05:39.588
Irving.

05:39.673 --> 05:43.092
Help me.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.803
Ah! That's much better.

05:45.887 --> 05:48.764
And now I leave you in the
capable hands of Muktar.

05:48.849 --> 05:52.101
He's our head guard.

05:52.227 --> 05:55.521
Please, it's better you
cooperate with him.

05:55.605 --> 05:57.523
He's a tough guy.

05:57.607 --> 06:01.027
And if there’s anything you require,
please don't hesitate to scream.

06:01.153 --> 06:04.030
Coming!

Follow me!

06:12.956 --> 06:14.915
Please sit.

06:18.545 --> 06:22.965
Robin of Loxley, where is your king?

06:23.091 --> 06:25.968
King? King?

06:26.053 --> 06:27.970
And which king might that be?

06:28.055 --> 06:31.515
King Richard, King Louis, King Kong?

06:31.600 --> 06:33.517
Larry King?

06:33.602 --> 06:38.147
Impertinent English dog! You shall talk.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.941
I don't think so.

06:41.026 --> 06:44.445
Chuchim, please,

06:44.529 --> 06:46.405
the tongue looseners.

06:51.787 --> 06:53.704
Speak, you dog.

06:53.830 --> 06:56.082
Speak! Uh-uh.

06:58.752 --> 07:02.088
Ooh!

07:05.759 --> 07:08.177
What did he say?

07:08.261 --> 07:10.429
You don't wanna know.

07:20.565 --> 07:23.150
You very brave for a not-at-homeboy.

07:23.235 --> 07:25.277
Oh, thank you.

07:25.362 --> 07:29.365
I've been in this place for a while.
Perhaps I can be of some service to you.

07:29.449 --> 07:33.285
- Do you have any questions?
- What are you in for?

07:34.538 --> 07:38.249
-Jaywalking.
- Oh. I see.

07:45.882 --> 07:48.634
It's not gonna be easy
getting out of here.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.971
What we need is a great feat of strength.

07:52.055 --> 07:54.140
Feat of strength?

07:54.224 --> 07:56.433
Au contraire!

07:56.518 --> 08:01.564
Now that you are here with me, what
we have is great strength of feet!

08:03.441 --> 08:06.652
- Don't follow.
- Do as I do.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.530
Put your feet on the bar, both feet.

08:09.614 --> 08:13.492
Now, on the count of kick—

08:13.618 --> 08:15.995
Kick! Ha-ha!

08:18.748 --> 08:21.917
- What was that noise?
- Uh, noise? Noise?

08:22.002 --> 08:23.919
Uh— Uh, uh, uh, uh-

08:24.004 --> 08:27.089
The noise you heard was the
breaking of this poor man's heart.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.049
Yes, that's it! Ohh!

08:29.134 --> 08:33.345
- What?
- He's decided to save his life by betraying his king.

08:33.429 --> 08:36.599
- Tsk, tsk, tsk.
- Oh, yes, that's it.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.808
Oh, damn my eyes.

08:38.894 --> 08:42.354
So go. Go tell your superiors
before he changes his mind.

08:42.438 --> 08:45.107
Oh, by the love of Allah,
this is a wonderful thing!

08:45.192 --> 08:47.568
Go.

08:47.652 --> 08:50.196
It will mean a big promotion for me.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.406
Go!

08:52.490 --> 08:54.700
Good news is always rewarded!

08:54.784 --> 08:57.203
Please go.

09:02.250 --> 09:06.086
On the other hand-

09:07.297 --> 09:10.132
bad news is severely punished.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.134
Aah!

09:13.762 --> 09:15.721
Now is our chance.

09:17.641 --> 09:19.600
Quick, follow me!

09:19.726 --> 09:22.519
You get that chain, I'll get this one.
Righto!

09:25.982 --> 09:27.942
We're free!

09:30.946 --> 09:33.364
We're free! We're going home!

09:39.621 --> 09:41.914
Move out of the way!

09:47.796 --> 09:51.257
Come on. Take my hand.

09:56.721 --> 09:59.139
All right, on the count of three!

09:59.224 --> 10:02.101
One, two, three!

10:11.653 --> 10:15.155
I just told them the good news, and-

10:15.240 --> 10:17.157
and-

10:18.285 --> 10:21.203
and I'm in deep shit.

10:37.345 --> 10:40.889
It is a very long journey from
Africa to England, my friend.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.850
Well.

10:42.934 --> 10:45.519
I owe you a great debt
of gratitude, my friend.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.521
I am called Robin of Loxley.

10:47.605 --> 10:50.566
My name is Asneeze, father of Ahchoo.

10:50.692 --> 10:52.776
Bless you. No, no, no, no, no.

10:52.861 --> 10:56.280
Ahchoo is my son. He's in
England, your country.

10:56.364 --> 10:58.449
He's an exchange student.

10:58.533 --> 11:00.951
I'd like you to look after him.

11:01.036 --> 11:05.748
He's in need of guidance. He
is headstrong and cocksure.

11:06.833 --> 11:09.293
Or is it the other way around?

11:09.377 --> 11:12.838
Say no more. I vow on the
sacred word of Loxley,

11:12.922 --> 11:16.091
I give you my undying
pledge, my solemn oath...

11:16.176 --> 11:19.219
on my father's honor, on
the blood of my heart,

11:19.346 --> 11:21.263
on the word of my soul- Good.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.932
on the very center of my
being, that nothing shall—

11:24.017 --> 11:27.436
You must go now, or you
will miss the tide.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.773
Yes, yes. Well, farewell, my friend.

11:30.857 --> 11:34.318
And not to worry. I'll find Ahchoo.

11:34.402 --> 11:37.571
Good-bye, my friend. Farewell.

11:37.655 --> 11:40.074
Safe journey!

12:13.066 --> 12:16.485
Home! Home!

12:16.569 --> 12:20.155
England! Ahh!

12:20.240 --> 12:24.410
Mmm! Mwah!

12:35.422 --> 12:38.966
Oh, a horse. A horse.
My kingdom for a horse.

12:55.859 --> 12:57.901
Get him!

13:01.322 --> 13:03.824
Hold him.

13:03.908 --> 13:07.119
Ahchoo?

13:07.203 --> 13:09.163
Bless you!

13:12.041 --> 13:15.669
Man, I hope someone's getting
a video of this thing.

13:17.755 --> 13:20.883
Damn!

13:20.967 --> 13:22.843
That must be him.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.726
Watch my back!

13:33.855 --> 13:36.315
Your back just got punched twice.

13:36.399 --> 13:38.984
Thank you.

13:45.783 --> 13:48.619
Hey, thanks, man. You're welcome.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.663
Who are you anyway?

13:51.748 --> 13:54.082
I think now is not the
time for introductions.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.084
Time out!

13:56.169 --> 13:59.755
Excuse me, bad guys. I
am running out of air.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.798
Gotta get pumped.

14:04.552 --> 14:07.179
Huh? Huh?

14:08.932 --> 14:11.391
Okay, honkies. Time in!

14:11.476 --> 14:16.730
By the by, do you know praying mantis?

14:16.814 --> 14:19.107
You're looking at him.

14:36.042 --> 14:39.086
Let's get out of here!

14:39.170 --> 14:41.088
Yeah, boy!

14:41.172 --> 14:43.048
Go ahead, punk!

14:43.174 --> 14:45.050
They're witches! They're mad!

14:45.176 --> 14:47.302
They're possessed! They're crazy!

14:48.805 --> 14:51.932
Good work. Thanks, man.

14:55.520 --> 14:58.981
You haven't seen the last of us!

15:10.577 --> 15:13.996
You've seen the last of us.

15:25.633 --> 15:27.884
There she is, Loxley Hall,

15:27.969 --> 15:30.554
home of my family for seven generations.

15:30.638 --> 15:33.140
Let's go!

15:33.224 --> 15:35.934
Move it! Come on. Let's go!

15:36.019 --> 15:38.145
That's it, boys. Let's go. Move it.

15:38.229 --> 15:40.772
That's it! Keep it going!

15:40.857 --> 15:42.774
Keep it going!

15:42.859 --> 15:46.153
Yes, come on, come on. Move it, move it.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.739
Here we go. Stop the castle!
Stop the castle!

15:51.075 --> 15:54.745
You there! I demand to know
what is going on here!

15:54.829 --> 15:56.788
Read it and weep.

15:58.750 --> 16:01.543
Hey, what up with that?

16:01.628 --> 16:03.462
"Hear ye, hear ye.

16:03.546 --> 16:05.881
"For failure to pay back taxes,

16:05.965 --> 16:08.884
"all the lands, castle and properties
of the family of Loxley...

16:08.968 --> 16:10.886
"shall be taken in lieu of payment.

16:10.970 --> 16:14.222
Signed, Prince John's royal
accountant, H.M.R. Blockhead"?

16:14.307 --> 16:16.224
This is a sham!

16:16.309 --> 16:18.894
I vow here and now I will restore
my castle to its rightful place.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.563
Yeah, yeah. You vow, we move!

16:21.648 --> 16:24.608
Let's go, boys! Take it out!

16:29.447 --> 16:32.741
So long! Move it!

16:32.825 --> 16:36.495
Keep it going! Come on!

16:36.579 --> 16:38.497
That's a boy!

16:52.970 --> 16:55.263
Blinkin?

16:55.390 --> 16:57.724
Who's that? It's Blinkin.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.310
Our family's loyal, blind servant.

17:02.063 --> 17:04.731
I gotta get the horse, man. Good.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.858
Blinkin! Uh, be right out.

17:13.407 --> 17:15.282
Blinkin!

17:15.410 --> 17:17.993
Master Robin, is that you? Yes!

17:18.121 --> 17:20.497
Back from the Crusades? Yes!

17:20.623 --> 17:23.458
And alive? Yes.

17:23.542 --> 17:26.211
Oh, happy day!

17:28.131 --> 17:32.134
I'm quite sure there was a door there.

17:32.218 --> 17:35.721
Master Robin!

17:35.805 --> 17:38.724
You lost your arms in battle.

17:38.808 --> 17:40.976
How— How terrible!

17:41.060 --> 17:43.311
But you grew some nice boobs.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.313
Blinkin, I'm over here.

17:45.398 --> 17:48.567
Oh. Uh, later.

17:48.651 --> 17:52.446
Blinkin, listen to me.
They've taken the castle.

17:52.530 --> 17:55.699
I thought it felt a bit drafty.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.701
Ohh!

17:57.785 --> 18:01.455
This never would have happened
if your father was alive.

18:01.539 --> 18:03.373
He's dead?

18:03.458 --> 18:05.417
Yes.

18:05.543 --> 18:08.712
And my mother? She died
of pneumonia whilst—

18:08.796 --> 18:10.964
Oh, you were away!

18:11.090 --> 18:14.551
My brothers? They were all
killed by the plague.

18:15.887 --> 18:17.804
My dog Pongo?

18:17.889 --> 18:19.848
Run over by a carriage.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.017
My goldfish Goldy?

18:22.101 --> 18:24.311
Eaten by the cat.

18:24.437 --> 18:28.064
My cat? Choked on the goldfish.

18:29.942 --> 18:33.612
Oh, it's good to be home,
ain't it, Master Robin?

18:33.696 --> 18:35.989
Oh! Oooh! Wait a minute.

18:36.073 --> 18:38.033
Wait a minute.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.035
What is that?

18:40.119 --> 18:44.039
Oh, your father wanted
me to give you this.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.875
He said that inside is the key...

18:46.959 --> 18:50.003
to the greatest treasure in all the land.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.881
Ohh. May I keep it?

18:52.965 --> 18:57.177
Um, no, Blinkin. I think I ought
to honor my father's wishes.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.471
Of course.

19:09.774 --> 19:14.319
Come, Blinkin. Let us leave
this depressing foundation.

19:14.403 --> 19:17.030
We have much to do and
less time to do it in.

19:17.114 --> 19:18.990
Yes.

19:19.075 --> 19:22.035
Hey. Hey, Robin, wait up.

19:22.119 --> 19:24.704
Oh, well done, Ahchoo.

19:24.789 --> 19:27.165
Yeah, he was running fast,
but I caught his ass.

19:27.291 --> 19:30.710
Who's that? Blinkin, I'd
like you to meet Ahchoo.

19:30.795 --> 19:32.879
A Jew? Here?

19:32.964 --> 19:35.549
No, no. Not a Jew. Ahchoo.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.593
Hey, put it there. How do you do?

19:38.678 --> 19:40.595
I've been better.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.389
- What is that?
- Help me! Help me!

19:44.308 --> 19:48.395
Aah, save me! Save me!

19:52.608 --> 19:55.068
Looks like a runaway white boy.

19:55.152 --> 19:57.863
All right. Steady on. What's the matter?

19:57.989 --> 20:01.366
They're after me. Who is?

20:01.450 --> 20:06.288
♪♪

20:06.372 --> 20:14.838
♪♪

20:14.922 --> 20:16.923
♪♪

20:17.008 --> 20:18.967
Over that boy hand!

20:22.638 --> 20:25.515
Hand over that boy.

20:26.934 --> 20:30.228
Who demands it? The
sheriff of Rottingham.

20:33.524 --> 20:35.650
And what has the boy done?

20:35.735 --> 20:38.153
He was caught poaching
in the king's forest.

20:38.237 --> 20:41.323
He "deered" to kill a king's dare.

20:41.407 --> 20:46.286
Dared to kill a king's deer.

20:46.370 --> 20:49.331
And this is an offense?

20:49.415 --> 20:53.877
One punishable by death.
Where have you been?

20:53.961 --> 20:56.504
Fighting with King
Richard in the Crusades.

20:56.589 --> 21:00.300
Unfortunately, my father couldn't
get me into the National Guard.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.928
Whoa-oh!

21:03.012 --> 21:06.264
How dare you talk to me in that fashion?

21:06.390 --> 21:09.309
Who are you? I am Robin of Loxley.

21:09.393 --> 21:11.311
Oh, yes, yes, I've heard of you.

21:11.395 --> 21:13.730
They say you're pretty
handy with a sword.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.774
Let's find out!

21:29.497 --> 21:31.998
I was angry at you before, Loxley,

21:32.124 --> 21:35.877
- but now I'm really pissed off!
-  Pissed off?

21:35.962 --> 21:38.088
If I was that close to a horse's wiener,

21:38.172 --> 21:40.924
I'd be worried about getting pissed on.

21:41.008 --> 21:44.928
You know, this wasn't a very smart
thing for you to have done, Loxley.

21:45.012 --> 21:46.972
I'll pay for this!

21:49.934 --> 21:52.352
You'll pay for this!

21:52.436 --> 21:55.271
Kill them!

21:58.567 --> 22:01.111
Wait, I've... changed my mind.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.905
Wise decision.

22:03.990 --> 22:08.159
So, until we meet again,

22:08.244 --> 22:10.245
have a safe journey.

All right, everybody. Later, later.

26:32.800 --> 26:35.301
See you later. Oh!

26:39.598 --> 26:42.183
Sire.

26:42.268 --> 26:44.185
I have news.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.896
What sort of news do you have?

26:46.981 --> 26:49.899
Not bad news, is it? You
know I can't take bad news.

26:49.984 --> 26:54.362
The day started out so good. Had a
good night's sleep. Had a good B.M.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.614
I don't want to hear any bad news.

26:56.699 --> 26:58.700
Now, what type of news is it?

26:58.784 --> 27:01.786
Well, to be perfectly frank, it's bad!

27:02.955 --> 27:04.872
I knew it!

27:04.957 --> 27:08.376
I knew it was bad news!

27:10.462 --> 27:13.006
Wait a minute. I have an idea.

27:13.090 --> 27:17.802
Maybe if you tell me the bad news in
a good way, it won't sound so bad.

27:19.430 --> 27:22.473
The bad— The bad news in a good way?

27:22.558 --> 27:25.476
Yes, I can do that. Bad
news in a good way.

27:25.561 --> 27:27.478
Um— Well, here goes.

27:32.026 --> 27:34.986
Wait till you hear this. I just
bumped into Robin of Loxley.

27:35.070 --> 27:37.905
He's back from the Crusades.

27:37.990 --> 27:42.493
You know, he just beat the
crap out of me and my men.

27:45.706 --> 27:49.167
He— He hates you, and he
loves your brother Richard.

27:51.503 --> 27:54.297
And-

27:57.343 --> 28:00.428
he wants to see you hanged!

28:00.512 --> 28:03.348
You-

28:03.432 --> 28:06.851
We're— We're— We're in
an awful lot of trouble!

28:10.439 --> 28:13.107
What, are you crazy?

28:13.192 --> 28:16.527
Why are you laughing?
This is terrible news!

28:16.612 --> 28:19.364
Well, I-I- You-You told me-

28:19.448 --> 28:21.616
I was just trying to soften the blow.

28:21.700 --> 28:24.369
Well, you blew it.

28:24.453 --> 28:26.788
This is a knotty problem,
sire, not easily solved.

28:26.872 --> 28:28.790
Yes, you're right.

28:29.875 --> 28:32.043
What to do?

28:32.127 --> 28:35.213
What to do? What to do?

28:36.298 --> 28:39.217
Got it! Latrine!

28:39.301 --> 28:40.093
The weird creature in the tower,
the one who protects my future.

28:40.094 --> 28:43.471
The weird creature in the tower,
the one who protects my future.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.973
Oh, yes, Latrine.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.934
Is she ugly!

28:53.357 --> 28:56.359
Latrine? Latrine, where are you?
I must talk with you!

28:56.443 --> 28:58.820
- Latrine! Latrine!
- No!

28:58.904 --> 29:02.657
Oh, it's you. There's a
new threat to my power.

29:02.741 --> 29:06.494
What can you tell me
about Robin of Loxley?

29:06.578 --> 29:09.664
Robin of Loxley? Robin of Loxley.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.833
Let me see.

29:13.335 --> 29:16.003
Raven's egg,

29:16.088 --> 29:18.339
blood of a hen!

29:18.424 --> 29:20.299
Little bit more blood, yes.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.679
Eyeballs of a crocodile.

29:26.765 --> 29:29.350
Testicles of a newt.

29:29.435 --> 29:32.437
I guess he's a transsexual now!

29:32.563 --> 29:35.273
Yeah. Ugh. Yes.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.572
Mmm!

29:43.907 --> 29:47.368
Robin of Loxley is handsome and brave.

29:47.453 --> 29:51.205
He seeks to regain his family's honor.

29:51.290 --> 29:54.417
The little sod could be trouble.

29:54.543 --> 29:56.419
Are you certain? Certain?

29:56.503 --> 29:59.755
You want certain, hire yourself a witch.
I'm just your cook.

29:59.840 --> 30:02.467
Here. Eat this.

30:02.551 --> 30:05.887
Hmm, looks fabulous.

30:05.971 --> 30:08.890
Looks like a seder at
Vincent Price's house.

30:16.482 --> 30:20.318
Such an unusual name, Latrine.
How did your family come by it?

30:20.402 --> 30:22.987
We changed it in the ninth century.

30:23.071 --> 30:25.698
You mean, you changed it...

30:25.782 --> 30:27.992
to Latrine?

30:28.076 --> 30:30.453
Yeah. Used to be Shithouse.

30:32.039 --> 30:34.582
It's a good change.

30:34.666 --> 30:37.668
It's a good change.

30:37.753 --> 30:41.631
Now, what about this Robin fellow, huh?

30:41.715 --> 30:44.091
How can I stop him?

30:44.176 --> 30:46.928
Maybe I could devise...

30:47.012 --> 30:48.930
a magic potion,

30:49.014 --> 30:52.600
one that would make him unable
to perform the slightest task.

30:53.852 --> 30:57.021
But in return, you must help me.

30:57.105 --> 31:01.275
What, are you kidding? Name it.
Anything you want.

31:01.360 --> 31:05.071
Put in a good word for me with
the sheriff of Rottingham.

31:05.155 --> 31:07.573
I've got the hots for him.

31:09.034 --> 31:11.202
Hmm.

31:11.286 --> 31:14.664
I keep a likeness of him in my boudoir.

31:14.748 --> 31:16.916
Oh. Ohh!

31:17.000 --> 31:19.460
Oh! Oh, Rotty!

31:19.545 --> 31:22.380
Rotty, Rotty, Rotty!

31:22.464 --> 31:24.507
I am amazed,

31:24.591 --> 31:27.635
to think that a handsome blade
like the sheriff of Rottingham...

31:27.719 --> 31:30.596
would ever want a creature like you.

31:32.724 --> 31:36.269
Well, if you’re gonna puncture my dreams,

31:36.353 --> 31:39.063
you can forget about my
promise to help you.

31:39.147 --> 31:42.817
No, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

31:42.901 --> 31:44.819
Wait.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.446
Maybe if we got him drunk.

31:51.618 --> 31:54.161
Very drunk.

31:54.246 --> 31:56.163
You got a shot.

32:02.379 --> 32:04.755
Ooh, good!

32:14.766 --> 32:17.226
Whoa.

32:20.397 --> 32:22.315
Dismount.

32:27.070 --> 32:30.281
Wait here. I'll go make sure it's safe.

32:48.675 --> 32:52.345
I say, would you mind, um,
awfully, getting out of the way?

32:52.429 --> 32:56.223
I say, not until you pay the toll.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.434
Toll? What toll?

32:58.518 --> 33:02.229
Well, the toll you pay
for crossing me bridge.

33:02.314 --> 33:04.231
I'm not paying any toll.

33:04.316 --> 33:06.901
This bridge is on my family's land.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.903
Well, it used to be my family's land.

33:08.987 --> 33:12.448
Hey. Hey, you're— you're Robin of Loxley!

33:12.532 --> 33:14.450
Hey!

33:14.534 --> 33:16.827
Yeah!

33:16.912 --> 33:18.829
And who might you be?

33:18.914 --> 33:21.082
Oh, they call me Little John.

33:21.166 --> 33:23.584
Uh, but don't let my name fool you.

33:23.669 --> 33:26.545
In real life, I'm very big.

33:26.630 --> 33:29.840
I'll take your word for it.
Now let me pass.

33:29.925 --> 33:32.426
Uh- No.

33:33.845 --> 33:36.722
Sorry, but a toll is a toll,

33:36.807 --> 33:38.724
and a roll is a roll,

33:38.809 --> 33:42.186
and if we don't get no tolls,
then we don't eat no rolls.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.606
I made that up.

33:45.691 --> 33:49.193
It's very fascinating. I'm afraid
I'm going to have to hurt you.

33:49.277 --> 33:52.822
Oh, yeah. My pleasure. Will!

33:59.746 --> 34:02.123
Thank you.

34:02.207 --> 34:04.208
Hey, Blinkin.

34:04.292 --> 34:06.335
Did you say, "Abe Lincoln"?

34:06.420 --> 34:09.630
No, I ain't say Abe Lincoln!
I said, "Hey, Blinkin."

34:09.715 --> 34:11.632
Hold the reins, man.

34:13.135 --> 34:15.344
Damn.

34:16.554 --> 34:18.472
Hey, Robin, Robin.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.683
Excuse me. No, excuse me.

34:20.766 --> 34:23.226
Hey, look, man. You
don't have to do this.

34:23.311 --> 34:27.815
Look, this ain't exactly the Mississippi.

34:27.899 --> 34:31.152
I'm on one side, see?
I'm on the other side.

34:31.235 --> 34:35.156
I'm on the east bank.
I'm on the west bank.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.949
It is not that critical.

34:38.034 --> 34:41.536
Not the point. It's the
principle of the thing.

34:41.621 --> 34:43.664
Yeah.

34:45.208 --> 34:47.083
Nice knowing you.

35:21.912 --> 35:23.871
Aah!

35:50.148 --> 35:52.191
Ow.

35:52.275 --> 35:54.527
Ow.

35:54.611 --> 35:56.529
Ow!

35:58.448 --> 36:00.825
Uh! Ho!

36:02.285 --> 36:05.454
Help me!

36:05.539 --> 36:07.456
I can't swim!

36:07.541 --> 36:11.377
I'm drowning! Oh, no, I'm drowning!

36:11.461 --> 36:15.172
Help me!

36:15.257 --> 36:17.925
Help me!

36:18.009 --> 36:20.553
Help me! Help me!

36:20.637 --> 36:24.807
Oh, God! Oh, I'm drowning! I'm
drowning, I'm drowning, I'm drowning!

36:28.311 --> 36:31.856
There, there. You're all right now.

36:31.982 --> 36:35.568
Thank you, Robin. You saved me life.

36:37.445 --> 36:39.029
What? Air!

36:39.155 --> 36:41.490
Sorry.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.909
There. I'm in your debit.

36:44.035 --> 36:47.246
Think nothing of it. Hey,
are y'all all right?

36:47.330 --> 36:49.915
Huh. Let me introduce you to my friends.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.293
That is Blinkin.

36:52.377 --> 36:54.295
And this is Ahchoo.

36:54.379 --> 36:56.297
Bless ya.

36:56.381 --> 36:58.716
That's my name, man.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.968
Ahchoo.

37:01.052 --> 37:04.722
Here, let me introduce you to
my best friend, Will Scarlet.

37:04.806 --> 37:06.932
Scarlet's my middle name.

37:07.017 --> 37:10.269
My full name is Will Scarlet O'Hara.

37:13.648 --> 37:15.691
We're from Georgia.

37:15.775 --> 37:17.693
He's deadly with his daggers.

37:17.777 --> 37:20.487
Really? How's about a demonstration?

37:20.572 --> 37:22.531
Gladly.

37:33.168 --> 37:35.169
All right then.

37:35.253 --> 37:38.756
Fire an arrow straight at my heart.

37:40.133 --> 37:43.135
- Are you serious?
- Absolutely.

37:49.476 --> 37:51.810
Okay. Good-bye.

37:59.152 --> 38:01.862
Hey, what part of Georgia are you from?

38:01.947 --> 38:03.822
South Central?

38:12.540 --> 38:16.001
Well, I haven't quite
figured that part out yet.

38:17.504 --> 38:20.214
I see.

38:20.298 --> 38:23.050
I'm sorry 'bout the toll thing, Robin.

38:23.134 --> 38:25.052
I mean, it's Prince John.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.638
He's taken our homes
and everything we own.

38:27.764 --> 38:31.684
We've nothin' left. Not
to worry, Little John.

38:31.768 --> 38:35.688
Even as we speak, I'm forming a plan to make
trouble for Prince John and Rottingham.

38:35.772 --> 38:38.774
Tonight, I'll crash their
party and serve warning...

38:38.858 --> 38:41.527
that there are those who will fight
to rid England of their tyranny.

38:41.653 --> 38:44.822
- Good! We'll join you!
- Yeah!

38:44.906 --> 38:47.616
No, no, no, no. I can't
risk the lives of others.

38:47.701 --> 38:51.453
One man can get in more
easily than half a dozen.

38:51.538 --> 38:53.914
Well, I must be off.

38:53.999 --> 38:56.750
Fare thee well. I'll see
thee upon my return.

38:56.835 --> 38:59.253
All right, man. Peace, bro.

38:59.337 --> 39:02.464
Take it easy. Thanks.

39:08.054 --> 39:10.597
Man, white men can’t jump.

39:17.522 --> 39:19.523
Ah. Here you are, son.

39:19.607 --> 39:21.525
Your ticket, sir.

39:57.562 --> 39:59.480
Kill him!

40:01.024 --> 40:03.400
No, wait.

40:03.485 --> 40:07.154
You know, a mime... is a
terrible thing to waste.

40:09.574 --> 40:11.533
Let him go.

40:17.582 --> 40:19.583
Lovely Bristols.

40:19.667 --> 40:21.585
Good evening, milady.

40:23.171 --> 40:25.089
Milady.

40:29.219 --> 40:33.138
Maid Marian, you know our
good sheriff of Rottingham.

40:33.223 --> 40:35.933
You look ravishing, my dear.

40:41.773 --> 40:44.566
Please allow me to help you to your seat.

40:48.071 --> 40:50.030
Mmm.

40:52.450 --> 40:56.954
I must say that Prince John has spared
no expense for tonight's party.

40:57.038 --> 40:59.957
We have exotic foods
from across the seas.

41:00.041 --> 41:03.502
Coconuts, bananas and dates.

41:03.628 --> 41:05.838
Would you care for a date?
Yes, thank you.

41:05.922 --> 41:08.715
How 'bout next Thursday?

41:13.471 --> 41:15.389
Good evening.

41:15.473 --> 41:17.933
That's- That's him!

41:18.977 --> 41:21.520
That's Loxley!

41:36.661 --> 41:38.954
Greetings, Your Highness.

41:40.999 --> 41:44.501
Traif. A present for you and your guests.

41:44.586 --> 41:46.503
That's a wild boar.

41:46.588 --> 41:50.048
No, no, that's a wild pig.
That's a wild bore.

41:50.175 --> 41:52.885
Funny!

41:52.969 --> 41:54.887
Very amusing.

41:57.265 --> 41:59.183
So you're Robin of Loxley, huh?

42:01.853 --> 42:04.980
I've heard so much about you.

42:06.107 --> 42:09.026
- And you are?
- Maid Marian.

42:09.110 --> 42:11.904
Ah, Maid Marian.

42:11.988 --> 42:14.865
Rumors of your beauty have
traveled far and wide,

42:14.991 --> 42:18.493
yet I see they hardly do you justice. Oh!

42:18.578 --> 42:21.079
Quite a smoothy.

42:21.206 --> 42:25.375
He's definitely a smoothy. Enough!

42:27.170 --> 42:29.129
King illegal forest...

42:29.214 --> 42:33.467
to pig wild kill in it a is!

42:33.593 --> 42:35.510
What? What?

42:35.595 --> 42:39.181
I mean, don't you know it is
illegal to kill a wild pig...

42:39.265 --> 42:41.767
in the king's forest?

42:41.851 --> 42:44.937
Is it not also illegal to sit in the
king's throne and usurp his power...

42:45.063 --> 42:47.814
in his absence?

42:47.941 --> 42:51.151
Careful, Robin. You go too far.
I've only just begun.

42:51.236 --> 42:54.988
I've come to warn you that if you do
not stop levying these evil taxes,

42:55.073 --> 42:59.368
I shall lead the good people of
England in a revolt against you.

42:59.452 --> 43:02.454
And why should the people listen to you?

43:02.538 --> 43:06.166
Because, unlike some other Robin Hoods,

43:06.292 --> 43:09.711
I can speak with an English accent.

43:09.796 --> 43:12.130
Oh!

43:12.215 --> 43:16.218
To tell you the truth, this guy
is starting to get on my nerves!

43:16.302 --> 43:18.220
Worry not, Your Highness.

43:18.304 --> 43:22.474
I shall dispose of this
feathered upstart.

43:22.684 --> 43:25.686
I challenge you to a duel.

43:36.614 --> 43:38.740
I accept.

43:38.825 --> 43:40.784
Whoa!

43:43.329 --> 43:46.206
That's going to cost you, Loxley.

43:46.291 --> 43:48.333
Please, put it on my bill.

43:48.418 --> 43:51.753
So it's come down to this, has it?
A fight to the death.

43:51.838 --> 43:54.006
Mano a mano,

43:54.090 --> 43:56.008
man to man,

43:56.092 --> 43:58.427
just you and me...

43:58.511 --> 44:01.221
and my guards!

44:06.644 --> 44:08.603
Ooh!

44:09.814 --> 44:12.274
Check, please. Table one.

44:22.702 --> 44:25.329
Ha!

44:39.135 --> 44:41.511
Uh. Ooh. Ah.

44:44.849 --> 44:47.434
Hurry, let's get out of here!

44:51.814 --> 44:54.316
Oh.

45:01.532 --> 45:03.492
Uhh.

45:19.634 --> 45:22.052
Refreshment, sir. Ah, thank you, Blinkin.

45:24.138 --> 45:26.932
Sounds like we're winning, sir.

45:27.058 --> 45:28.975
Indeed, we are. Carry on. Right you are.

45:34.899 --> 45:38.026
Save me, save me. Hurt them, hurt them!

45:38.111 --> 45:40.946
Yes, save them, save them. Hurt
you, hurt you. I've got it.

45:41.030 --> 45:44.241
Ohh!

45:55.837 --> 45:58.088
Care for some dessert?

45:59.507 --> 46:01.925
One, two, three!

46:02.009 --> 46:04.553
Fire!

46:07.223 --> 46:09.266
Maid Marian!

46:09.350 --> 46:11.935
Do you believe in... love at first sight?

46:12.019 --> 46:16.648
Depends on what you're looking at.

46:17.692 --> 46:22.737
Well? Yes! Yes! Yes!

46:25.658 --> 46:28.160
Where is she? Ohh!

46:28.244 --> 46:30.162
To be continued.

46:33.583 --> 46:36.042
Mein liebchen, I'm so glad I found you.

46:36.127 --> 46:38.378
Come on. This party's getting rough.

46:38.463 --> 46:40.422
Hyah!

47:19.462 --> 47:21.254
Am I good? I'm good.

47:21.464 --> 47:24.299
Bar the doors! Don't let them get away.
Surround the great hall.

47:24.383 --> 47:26.301
Now you're talkin'.

47:26.385 --> 47:28.345
Shut the door.

47:51.369 --> 47:54.287
I hope it's worth the noise!

48:12.932 --> 48:15.016
We've got him. We've got him.

48:17.603 --> 48:20.397
Aha! Right rope.

48:42.128 --> 48:45.005
Oh!

48:45.089 --> 48:47.007
Look at this.

48:47.091 --> 48:50.677
We went from royalty to recycling.

48:50.761 --> 48:53.972
Little John, would you get the door?
Yeah, I'll try.

48:55.308 --> 48:57.559
Well, it's been a wonderful party,

48:57.643 --> 48:59.894
and we'd love to stay
and all that, but, um,

48:59.979 --> 49:02.731
I'm afraid we really must dash, so ta-ta.

49:14.368 --> 49:16.286
No, no, no.

49:23.961 --> 49:26.588
I sent word throughout
England that each village...

49:26.672 --> 49:29.049
should send the very best men they have.

49:29.133 --> 49:31.384
These are them.

49:34.430 --> 49:38.808
Hmm, we're in a lot of trouble.

49:40.686 --> 49:44.230
Good people who have traveled
from villages near and far,

49:44.315 --> 49:46.232
lend me your ears.

49:51.656 --> 49:54.240
That's disgusting.

49:54.325 --> 49:56.493
Hear me!

49:56.619 --> 49:59.746
Men the likes of Prince John and
Rottingham must be stopped.

49:59.830 --> 50:03.333
Stopped from taxing us into poverty, from
taking from us what is rightfully ours.

50:05.544 --> 50:08.129
If we stand up to them,
all together as one,

50:08.214 --> 50:10.465
we can win the day!

50:10.549 --> 50:14.302
We shall go on to the end.
We shall not flag or fail.

50:14.387 --> 50:16.805
We shall fight on the seas and oceans.

50:16.889 --> 50:20.433
We shall defend our isle,
whatever the cost may be.

50:20.518 --> 50:23.478
We shall never surrender.

50:23.562 --> 50:25.438
Then they shall say of us,

50:25.523 --> 50:27.774
"Never have so many...

50:27.858 --> 50:30.527
owed so much to so few."

50:33.739 --> 50:36.241
That was beautiful. What's going on?

50:36.325 --> 50:38.201
They're asleep.

50:40.621 --> 50:42.747
Hey, man.

50:42.832 --> 50:44.958
Tough room.

50:45.084 --> 50:49.587
Why don't you let me give it a try? Okay.

50:58.723 --> 51:01.766
Look at yourselves!

51:01.851 --> 51:05.520
Go ahead. Take a look around.

51:05.604 --> 51:09.190
- Oh, people of Sherwood, you been had!
-  - Yeah!

51:09.316 --> 51:11.192
Hoodwinked! Yeah!

51:11.318 --> 51:13.236
Bamboozled! Yeah!

51:13.320 --> 51:15.238
Run amok.

51:15.322 --> 51:17.490
We didn't land on Sherwood Forest.

51:17.575 --> 51:20.243
Sherwood Forest landed on us!

51:20.327 --> 51:21.953
Yeah!

51:22.037 --> 51:23.955
Very good.

51:24.039 --> 51:26.708
They're all warmed up.

51:26.792 --> 51:31.004
Brother Ahchoo is right.
And I say we fight back!

51:31.130 --> 51:33.256
Yeah! Yes.

51:33.340 --> 51:38.011
- Are you with me, yea or nay?
- Which one means yes?

51:38.095 --> 51:43.016
- Yea.
- Yea!

51:44.435 --> 51:46.728
Men, grab your uniforms and equipment...

51:46.812 --> 51:48.938
and prepare for the training sequence.

51:49.023 --> 51:53.401
All right, gentlemen, grab your
feathered caps, jerkins, bodkins,

51:53.486 --> 51:56.780
boots, swords, quivers...

51:56.864 --> 51:59.282
and panty hose.

52:02.578 --> 52:05.371
Now, men, the object of this exercise...

52:05.456 --> 52:08.082
is to hit the target.

52:13.464 --> 52:16.174
All right?

52:24.391 --> 52:26.309
Oh!

52:31.148 --> 52:33.024
Hmm!

52:33.150 --> 52:35.777
Oh!

52:45.287 --> 52:48.081
Now, men, I want you to
keep your eye on Will...

52:48.165 --> 52:50.083
and do exactly as he does.

52:51.502 --> 52:53.419
Ah-ooh!

52:59.343 --> 53:01.553
Yeah! Very good. Well done, Will.

53:01.679 --> 53:03.805
Right! All right, Will!

53:03.931 --> 53:08.184
That's not so hard. We could do that.
Piece of cake.

53:10.980 --> 53:14.148
Good boy. Ready, men?

53:15.818 --> 53:17.694
Charge!

53:25.578 --> 53:28.830
Oh, man.

53:28.914 --> 53:32.041
Hey, Rob, man, maybe we should
take the dummies into battle.

53:32.126 --> 53:34.043
Ha!

53:36.171 --> 53:38.965
Hmm.

53:43.387 --> 53:47.098
Sire? I must speak with you.

53:49.351 --> 53:51.269
What are you smelling?

53:51.353 --> 53:55.565
These aren't my bubbles.
They're from the pipes.

53:55.691 --> 53:58.776
Your Majesty, I have terrible news. What?

53:58.861 --> 54:01.446
"Strucky" has "loxed" again.

54:01.572 --> 54:05.992
What? Loxley has struck again.

54:06.076 --> 54:09.412
I'm gonna need privacy,
so you guys can blow.

54:11.415 --> 54:13.958
Not blow. Blow!

54:20.341 --> 54:22.634
I'm so depressed.

54:22.718 --> 54:27.013
Your Majesty, come with me, and I will show
you something that will make you very happy.

54:27.097 --> 54:31.100
Fetch the royal robe! Your Majesty?

54:31.185 --> 54:33.895
Stop me if I'm wrong about this, but...

54:33.979 --> 54:38.066
wasn't your mole... on the other side?

54:39.902 --> 54:42.362
I have a mole?

54:42.446 --> 54:44.364
What is it?

54:44.448 --> 54:47.867
It's what we've named a stealth catapult.

54:47.952 --> 54:51.371
We've been working on
it secretly for months.

54:51.455 --> 54:55.667
It can hurl one of these
heavy boulders, undetected,

54:55.751 --> 54:59.629
over a hundred yards, completely
destroying anything it hits.

54:59.755 --> 55:02.548
Wow! How does it work? It's quite simple.

55:02.633 --> 55:05.718
You just take one of these heavy
rocks, put it here where I'm sitting,

55:05.803 --> 55:07.679
and then pull on that lever.

55:07.805 --> 55:09.931
You mean, like this?

55:13.018 --> 55:15.228
Oh, Dear Lord,

55:15.312 --> 55:19.315
if you see fit to send
me my one true love—

55:22.403 --> 55:24.529
Thank you!

55:26.991 --> 55:29.325
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

55:29.451 --> 55:32.537
Oh, my God! Here! Let me
work my magic on you!

55:32.663 --> 55:35.581
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

55:35.666 --> 55:38.292
No, no! I've got a headache.
I've got a headache.

55:38.377 --> 55:41.587
Where are you going? Oh, bugger!

55:43.716 --> 55:45.675
I was that close.

55:47.219 --> 55:49.637
I touched it.

55:56.395 --> 55:59.105
I don't like the way you're walking.

55:59.189 --> 56:02.108
You've been into the
sacramental wine again.

56:02.192 --> 56:04.193
You're farshnoshket!

56:04.278 --> 56:06.779
You drunken mule, you.

56:10.868 --> 56:13.911
Whoa, Morris, whoa.

56:13.996 --> 56:15.913
Halt there, friend.

56:15.998 --> 56:19.000
You’ve just entered the territory
of Robin Hood and his Merry Men.

56:24.548 --> 56:27.383
- Faigelehs?
- No!

56:27.468 --> 56:30.678
No, no, no, no. We're
straight, just merry.

56:30.763 --> 56:33.264
Azoy? And who might you be,

56:33.348 --> 56:35.850
with the exceptionally
long feather in your hat?

56:35.976 --> 56:39.270
I am Robin of Loxley. Robin of Loxley?

56:39.354 --> 56:41.647
I've just come from Maid Marian,

56:41.732 --> 56:46.152
the lady whose heart you stole,
you prince of thieves, you.

56:48.906 --> 56:52.325
I knew her mother and father before
they were taken in the plague.

56:52.409 --> 56:54.577
Lord and Lady Bagelle.

56:54.661 --> 56:57.330
You were meant for each
other, you and Maid Marian.

56:57.414 --> 57:01.751
What a combination! Loxley and Bagelle.
You can't miss.

57:02.878 --> 57:04.754
And who are you, sir?

57:04.838 --> 57:07.006
I am Rabbi Tuckman,

57:07.091 --> 57:09.509
purveyor of sacramental wine...

57:09.593 --> 57:12.053
and mohel extraordinaire.

57:12.137 --> 57:16.307
- Hello, Rabbi.
- Hello, boys.

57:16.391 --> 57:19.185
Mohel. Don't believe I've ever
heard of that profession.

57:19.269 --> 57:23.940
Mohel? He's a very important guy.
He makes circumcisions.

57:24.024 --> 57:27.401
What, pray tell, sir, is a circumcision?

57:27.528 --> 57:31.489
Oh, it's the latest rage. The
ladies love it. I want one!

57:31.615 --> 57:33.991
I'll take two. Put me down too.
I'm getting one.

57:34.118 --> 57:37.370
I'm game. How's it done? It's a snap.

57:37.454 --> 57:40.039
I take my little machine.

57:41.458 --> 57:44.043
I take your little thing, see?

57:44.128 --> 57:46.546
I put it into this little hole here,

57:46.630 --> 57:49.173
and... nip the tip!

57:49.258 --> 57:51.008
Ow!

57:51.093 --> 57:54.804
- Who's first?
- I changed me mind.

57:54.930 --> 57:58.057
I forgot, man. I already got one.
Christian.

57:58.142 --> 58:00.560
I gotta work with a much younger crowd.

58:00.644 --> 58:03.855
Rabbi, you seem to be
on the side of good.

58:03.939 --> 58:06.858
Will you join us and share
with us some of your wisdom,

58:06.942 --> 58:10.528
some of your counsel, and, uh, perhaps...
some of your wine?

58:12.698 --> 58:14.907
Wisdom and counsel, that's easy.

58:14.992 --> 58:19.871
But this is sacramental wine.
It's only used to bless things.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.793
Wait a minute!

58:25.878 --> 58:28.421
There's things here- there's
trees, there's rocks,

58:28.505 --> 58:30.715
there's birds, there's squirrels.

58:30.799 --> 58:34.218
Come on! We'll bless them all
until we get farshnoshket!

58:34.303 --> 58:37.096
Join me!

58:37.181 --> 58:39.724
Let's hear it for the rabbi!

58:50.527 --> 58:53.863
Good evening, Don Giovanni. Yeah.

58:53.947 --> 58:58.367
Buona sera. Buona sera.

58:58.452 --> 59:01.162
Yes. It was, uh, very good of you
to come at such short notice.

59:01.288 --> 59:04.582
Well. And all the way from Jersey.

59:04.666 --> 59:07.168
Well, it is quite a drive.

59:07.252 --> 59:12.506
Yes, but you do realize that Prince John
expressly commanded this to be a secret meeting?

59:12.591 --> 59:15.259
I mean, who are these men?

59:15.344 --> 59:17.803
These are my trusted associates.

59:17.888 --> 59:20.223
On my right, Dirty Ezio.

59:22.935 --> 59:27.313
On my left, Filthy Luca.

59:27.439 --> 59:31.692
Now. We thank you for inviting us...

59:31.818 --> 59:35.613
on the day of your daughter's wedding.
No, no.

59:35.697 --> 59:39.242
I hope her first child
is a masculine child.

59:39.326 --> 59:41.911
Shut up. We didn't even
have our meeting yet.

59:42.037 --> 59:44.538
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

59:47.125 --> 59:49.043
All right.

59:49.127 --> 59:52.630
I understand that you have been
bothered by this fruit, Robin Hood.

59:52.714 --> 59:55.716
That you want Robin rubbed out,

59:55.801 --> 59:58.594
eliminated, maybe even killed.

59:58.679 --> 01:00:01.389
Yes. You put it succinctly.

01:00:01.515 --> 01:00:05.434
Suck what? Succinctly.
It means perfectly.

01:00:05.519 --> 01:00:07.436
Oh, yeah. Well, I knew that.

01:00:10.524 --> 01:00:13.276
Excuse me, Don Giovanni.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:15.778
Your lizard seems limp.

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:19.907
At my age, you know, sometimes-

01:00:19.992 --> 01:00:22.285
Oh, oh, my lizard. Oh! No.

01:00:22.369 --> 01:00:24.787
Nah, he’s just sleeping. Charlie.

01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:26.956
Charlie. Oh, Charlie.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:31.711
Charlie, I could've been somebody.
I could have been a contender.

01:00:31.795 --> 01:00:34.588
You know, Charlie's—
Charlie's got bad breath.

01:00:36.258 --> 01:00:39.969
Oh! He got excited, you know.

01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:42.471
Come over here, Ezio.

01:00:43.849 --> 01:00:46.100
Uh— Mmm, no.

01:00:46.184 --> 01:00:50.021
Now, normally I would be so
happy to be of service to you,

01:00:50.105 --> 01:00:53.607
but there is something that
weighs very heavily on my heart.

01:00:53.692 --> 01:00:57.445
In the years that we have been
friends, England and Jersey,

01:00:57.529 --> 01:01:01.615
never once have you invited me to
your home for coffee and cake...

01:01:01.742 --> 01:01:05.286
or ganool, something, you know.
A "guh-what"?

01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:07.913
A ganool. It's a pastry with stuffing.

01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:10.374
And it's got sprinkles on it. Mmm.

01:01:10.459 --> 01:01:14.128
Excuse me. I don't understand
a word you're saying.

01:01:14.212 --> 01:01:18.382
I just came back from the dentist,

01:01:18.467 --> 01:01:22.720
and they left in the cotton balls.

01:01:22.804 --> 01:01:26.265
I will take these cotton balls
from you with my hand...

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:29.769
and put them in my pocket.

01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:35.191
Yeah. Whatever.

01:01:35.275 --> 01:01:37.443
You know, your other
associate says very little.

01:01:37.569 --> 01:01:39.779
Well, my other associate says nothing.
Why is that?

01:01:39.863 --> 01:01:43.199
Because my enemy cut out his tongue.

01:01:43.283 --> 01:01:45.743
Good grief! Why?

01:01:45.827 --> 01:01:49.497
Well, 'cause he went like this.

01:01:49.581 --> 01:01:52.875
And he didn't like it, so
he cut out his tongue.

01:01:52.959 --> 01:01:55.002
Come over here. Go like this.

01:01:57.089 --> 01:02:00.299
He can't do it.

01:02:00.384 --> 01:02:04.261
I love to tease him!

01:02:04.388 --> 01:02:07.765
Tell me, Don Giovanni.
Yeah, that's me. What?

01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:09.767
What do you intend to
do about Robin Hood?

01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:11.769
Listen to this. I got an idea.

01:02:11.853 --> 01:02:15.773
Tomorrow— Tomorrow you're gonna
have your medieval fun and games.

01:02:15.857 --> 01:02:18.901
You'll make the most important
event the archery contest.

01:02:19.027 --> 01:02:22.530
Robin will not be able to resist.
Why is that?

01:02:22.614 --> 01:02:25.491
We'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:28.786
I was just gonna say that.

01:02:28.912 --> 01:02:30.788
That's brilliant! Thank you.

01:02:30.914 --> 01:02:32.832
But- What?

01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:36.043
You do realize that Robin is
the finest archer in the land?

01:02:36.128 --> 01:02:38.295
Oh, no. Don't you understand?

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:41.173
Luca is good, better, best.

01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:44.093
Show him your archery medals.

01:02:44.177 --> 01:02:46.095
Ta-da!

01:02:46.179 --> 01:02:48.514
Wowee!

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:51.267
See? I couldn't have
said it better myself.

01:02:51.351 --> 01:02:55.104
Now, Luca beats Robin
at the archery contest,

01:02:55.188 --> 01:02:59.942
and then Dirty Ezio makes Robin no more.

01:03:02.362 --> 01:03:05.948
No more? All right, you
want plain English?

01:03:06.032 --> 01:03:08.576
Robin is gonna be dead.

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:12.288
D-E-D. Dead.

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:23.048
You hear him?

01:03:40.525 --> 01:03:42.902
Broomhilde? Broomhilde, wake up!

01:03:42.986 --> 01:03:44.862
There's a foul plot afoot.

01:03:44.988 --> 01:03:48.199
It's not mine feet. I just washed them.
No, no, no.

01:03:48.283 --> 01:03:51.118
Prince John and the sheriff
have hired men to kill Robin.

01:03:51.244 --> 01:03:53.287
We must warn him immediately!

01:03:53.371 --> 01:03:56.248
Wait, mein lady! If Prince
John should see us-

01:03:56.374 --> 01:03:59.418
You're right. We'll go out the back.
Right.

01:04:01.922 --> 01:04:03.881
Lady!

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:15.267
Broomhilde, I'm going on ahead.

01:04:15.352 --> 01:04:18.062
Catch me up. Come on, Lady.

01:04:19.314 --> 01:04:21.899
Farfelkugel!

01:04:44.673 --> 01:04:46.632
Ooh.

01:04:51.805 --> 01:04:54.848
Farfelkugel. If I was you,

01:04:54.933 --> 01:04:57.518
I would never do that again.

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:01.564
Any questions?

01:05:01.648 --> 01:05:04.233
Good.

01:05:07.946 --> 01:05:10.030
Forward!

01:05:25.005 --> 01:05:28.215
Blinkin, what are you doing up there?

01:05:29.384 --> 01:05:32.803
Guessing. I...

01:05:32.887 --> 01:05:35.931
guess no one's coming.

01:05:38.435 --> 01:05:42.605
Please come down from there. Twit.

01:05:45.567 --> 01:05:48.319
Well, I guess there's a
ladder around here somewhere.

01:05:48.403 --> 01:05:51.697
Oh. Here we are. Right.

01:06:02.417 --> 01:06:04.460
Oh, shit.

01:06:18.767 --> 01:06:20.726
I can see!

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:30.736
No, I was wrong.

01:06:41.790 --> 01:06:44.917
Blimey, these are hard to get on.

01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:48.837
Let's face it. You gotta
be a man to wear tights.

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:54.009
Will, how are me seams?

01:06:54.135 --> 01:06:57.846

Here. Allow me.

01:08:42.993 --> 01:08:44.912
Oh, thank you.

01:08:54.714 --> 01:08:56.965
You are so sweet.

01:08:57.050 --> 01:09:00.385
Is there anything I can do for you?

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:02.888
Yeah. You can get off me.

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:08.185
Little John!

01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:10.187
I panicked.

01:09:16.236 --> 01:09:18.862
Darling, what are you doing here?
I have come to warn you.

01:09:18.947 --> 01:09:22.282
Prince John and Rottingham have hired
murderers to kill you at the fair tomorrow!

01:09:22.367 --> 01:09:24.993
You mustn't go!

01:09:25.078 --> 01:09:28.287
That's easy. I won't.

01:09:28.372 --> 01:09:30.832
Oh, I'm so happy.

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:35.170
They were going to try to lure you
there by having an archery contest.

01:09:35.255 --> 01:09:38.215
An archery contest?

01:09:38.299 --> 01:09:40.384
Their archer is unbeatable.

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:44.888
Really? Robin, promise you won't go.

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:49.100
All right. I promise you won't go.
Thank you.

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:52.895
- Hey, wait a minute, Robin. You said that—
- Cool it.

01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:56.191
Chill.

01:09:56.276 --> 01:09:58.235
Come, my dear.

01:10:07.078 --> 01:10:10.247

Or if a man pledged his

Yes- Or if I knew that he

wearing underneath that cape?

01:27:41.465 --> 01:27:43.925
Jump.

01:27:51.475 --> 01:27:53.392
Oh, yeah!

01:27:54.853 --> 01:27:56.812
Ow.

01:28:04.154 --> 01:28:07.782
I shall have you, married or no.

01:28:28.762 --> 01:28:30.805
Yeah!

01:28:36.228 --> 01:28:39.355
The sheriff. He got your woman, man.

01:28:39.439 --> 01:28:42.608
He's takin' her to the tower.

01:28:42.693 --> 01:28:46.821
He gonna deflower her in the tower. Ooh.

01:28:46.905 --> 01:28:51.742
I'm sorry we don't have enough
time for romance, my dear.

01:28:54.246 --> 01:28:57.707
Consider this foreplay.

01:29:01.837 --> 01:29:03.879
A chastity belt!

01:29:03.964 --> 01:29:07.717
Ooh, that's going to chafe my willy.

01:29:07.843 --> 01:29:09.635
I'll be back. Wha-

01:29:09.761 --> 01:29:13.097
I hope she's still wearin'
her iron underwear. Yeah.

01:29:15.142 --> 01:29:17.518
No matter what you do,

01:29:17.602 --> 01:29:21.188
I shall never submi-i-i-it!

01:29:26.653 --> 01:29:29.822
- Aha!
- Robi-i-i-in!

01:29:32.868 --> 01:29:35.786
Prepare for the fight scene.

01:29:35.871 --> 01:29:39.957
Forgive the interruption, my darling.

01:29:40.042 --> 01:29:44.336
I'll dispatch your love
and then come back...

01:29:44.421 --> 01:29:46.922
and finish the job.

01:29:50.302 --> 01:29:52.970
En garde. Thanks for the warning.

01:29:57.642 --> 01:29:59.769
Shocking!

01:30:06.193 --> 01:30:09.361
Parry, parry, thrust, thrust.

01:30:09.446 --> 01:30:11.363
Good!

01:30:49.986 --> 01:30:53.239
Hey! Oh, sorry.

01:31:35.657 --> 01:31:38.325
It is the key to the greatest
treasure in all the land!

01:31:38.410 --> 01:31:42.163
Oh! Robin, this means you've
always been my one true love,

01:31:42.247 --> 01:31:44.415
because it’s just the right size.

01:31:44.499 --> 01:31:48.502
It's not the size that counts!
It's how you use it!

01:31:48.587 --> 01:31:51.088
Robin!

01:31:51.173 --> 01:31:53.507
Aha! Ha, ha!

01:31:55.886 --> 01:31:58.179
Ha, ha.

01:32:00.599 --> 01:32:04.059
Thank you, my friend.

01:32:05.937 --> 01:32:07.980
Aah.

01:32:18.033 --> 01:32:20.451
Oh, it's not so bad.

01:32:23.622 --> 01:32:25.581
I was wrong.

01:32:31.630 --> 01:32:34.673
Oh, my dear beloved
sheriff of Rottingham!

01:32:34.758 --> 01:32:36.675
You've been run through.

01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:39.553
How do you feel?

01:32:39.638 --> 01:32:42.973
I'm dying, you fool!

01:32:43.099 --> 01:32:45.017
You don't have to die. I don't?

01:32:45.101 --> 01:32:49.396
No. I've got this magic pill...

01:32:49.481 --> 01:32:51.857
that could save your life.

01:32:53.443 --> 01:32:58.072
And I'll give it to you if
you promise to marry me...

01:32:58.156 --> 01:33:00.658
and be mine forever.

01:33:04.162 --> 01:33:07.831
Oh, all right. Yes, yes.

01:33:16.091 --> 01:33:18.926
How do you feel now? Good, good.

01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:22.846
Surprisingly good. And yet, somehow...

01:33:23.890 --> 01:33:26.350
incredibly depressed.

01:33:38.947 --> 01:33:41.448
I always wanted to marry a cop.

01:33:41.533 --> 01:33:46.287
Wait, wait! I've changed my mind!

01:33:50.417 --> 01:33:53.127
I love you, Robin of Loxley.

01:33:53.211 --> 01:33:55.671
And I you, Marian of Bagelle.

01:33:55.755 --> 01:33:57.715
Oh!

01:34:09.894 --> 01:34:11.770
Oh, my darling.

01:34:11.896 --> 01:34:16.442
At last. Yes, yes.

01:34:16.526 --> 01:34:20.696
Yes, yes! Yes!

01:34:22.741 --> 01:34:25.159
No!

01:34:29.289 --> 01:34:32.082
Wait, wait! You're not married yet!

01:34:32.167 --> 01:34:35.961
Before you do it, you must go through it.

01:34:36.046 --> 01:34:40.049
Or else I blew it.

01:34:47.057 --> 01:34:49.141
Hey, Rabbi!

01:34:53.772 --> 01:34:55.689
Who calls?

01:34:55.774 --> 01:35:00.444
It is I, Robin. We wish to
get married in a hurry!

01:35:00.528 --> 01:35:03.238
Married in a hurry!
That's wonderful. Wait!

01:35:03.323 --> 01:35:06.033
I'm on my last customer.
I'll be right out.

01:35:10.121 --> 01:35:13.499
Put a little ice on it. It'll be fine.
Ay, yi, yi!

01:35:15.877 --> 01:35:19.213
Married in a hurry, married in a hurry!
Please invite me to the bris.

01:35:19.297 --> 01:35:21.173
Now, are you ready?

01:35:21.299 --> 01:35:23.342
Robin, do you? I do.

01:35:23.468 --> 01:35:25.844
Marian, do you? I do.

01:35:25.970 --> 01:35:29.807
I now pronounce you man and- I object.

01:35:29.933 --> 01:35:32.101
Who asked?

01:35:32.227 --> 01:35:35.854
It's King Richard, back
from the Crusades!

01:35:35.939 --> 01:35:39.775
Boy, now I'm in trouble.

01:35:44.155 --> 01:35:46.407
You are no longer worthy to wear...

01:35:46.491 --> 01:35:49.159
this sacred symbol of authority!

01:35:51.079 --> 01:35:53.872
Oh, please have mercy on me, Brother.

01:35:53.957 --> 01:35:57.459
It wasn't my fault. I got some
really bad advice from Rottingham.

01:35:57.544 --> 01:35:59.253
Bullshit! Bullshit!

01:35:59.337 --> 01:36:03.757
Brother, you have surrounded
your given name...

01:36:03.842 --> 01:36:07.010
with a foul stench.

01:36:07.095 --> 01:36:09.012
From this day forth,

01:36:09.097 --> 01:36:11.181
all the toilets in this kingdom...

01:36:11.266 --> 01:36:15.227
shall be known as "johns."

01:36:15.353 --> 01:36:18.439
No!

01:36:18.523 --> 01:36:20.858
Take him away! No. Wait, wait.

01:36:20.942 --> 01:36:24.486
Put him in the Tower of London.

01:36:24.612 --> 01:36:28.782
Make him part of the tour.

01:36:32.829 --> 01:36:36.081
Robin, the news of your great deeds...

01:36:36.166 --> 01:36:38.459
has reached me even in Jerusalem.

01:36:38.543 --> 01:36:41.795
England owes you and your men
a great debt of gratitude.

01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:46.258
Henceforth, all your family's
rights and lands shall be returned,

01:36:46.342 --> 01:36:49.470
and you shall rule all
Sherwood from this day forth.

01:36:53.558 --> 01:36:56.852
Kneel, Robin of Loxley.

01:37:00.064 --> 01:37:04.610
And arise, Sir Robin of Loxley.

01:37:09.741 --> 01:37:12.618
Thank you, sir. Excuse me, King.

01:37:12.702 --> 01:37:17.331
Why, if you like this guy so much, do
you object to his marrying Maid Marian?

01:37:17.415 --> 01:37:20.751
I have no objections, but I
have not yet kissed the bride.

01:37:20.835 --> 01:37:23.962
It is a custom and my royal right.

01:37:24.088 --> 01:37:26.465
Hold this, Father. Rabbi.

01:37:26.549 --> 01:37:28.550
Whatever.

01:37:37.852 --> 01:37:40.145
It's good to be the king.

01:37:44.108 --> 01:37:47.486
Now you may marry them. Thank you, Your Majesty.
Here's your knife.

01:37:47.612 --> 01:37:49.530
Sword. Whatever.

01:37:51.032 --> 01:37:54.284
Okay, where did we leave off?
Oh, that's right.

01:37:54.369 --> 01:37:58.413
- We're up to the best part. Do you, Marian?
- I do.

01:37:58.540 --> 01:38:00.874
Do you, Robin? I do.

01:38:00.959 --> 01:38:04.878
I now pronounce you man and...

01:38:07.131 --> 01:38:08.966
wife.

01:38:16.849 --> 01:38:20.018
We're going to have to
remodel the castle...

01:38:20.103 --> 01:38:23.272
to make room for all the babies.

01:38:28.611 --> 01:38:30.529
For my first order of business,

01:38:30.613 --> 01:38:33.949
I wish to appoint a new
sheriff of Rottingham.

01:38:34.033 --> 01:38:37.160
My friend, Ahchoo.

01:38:37.245 --> 01:38:39.246
All right!

01:38:39.330 --> 01:38:41.832
A black sheriff?

01:38:41.916 --> 01:38:44.126
He's black?

01:38:44.210 --> 01:38:48.797
And why not? It worked
in Blazing Saddles.

01:38:50.091 --> 01:38:52.175
That's good.

01:38:53.970 --> 01:38:58.974
