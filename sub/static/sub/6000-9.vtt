00:00.109 --> 00:02.248
Previously on "Finding Carter"...

00:02.273 --> 00:04.975
Baby, you do not look at all well.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.716
I've got it under control.

00:06.752 --> 00:08.167
You knew eventually it would come to this.

00:08.220 --> 00:10.587
The truth has to come out.
The truth has to come out.

00:10.639 --> 00:11.671
Hi.

00:11.673 --> 00:13.056
This is Madison.

00:13.091 --> 00:15.842
She's my friend from back there.

00:15.894 --> 00:17.010
Remember back with Lori?

00:17.012 --> 00:18.728
You could come and go whenever you wanted.

00:18.764 --> 00:20.513
Nobody was telling you what to do.

00:20.515 --> 00:22.682
- Don't you miss that? 
- Yeah.

00:22.684 --> 00:24.100
I guess I just try not to think about it.

00:24.152 --> 00:25.852
Well, she thinks about you all the time.

00:25.904 --> 00:27.854
- How do you know that?
- I've been talking to her.

00:27.856 --> 00:28.988
I don't want to be apart.

00:29.024 --> 00:30.523
We had a really great thing going.

00:30.525 --> 00:31.825
We should have it again.

00:31.860 --> 00:34.410
You love her. You two are so good together.

00:34.446 --> 00:35.862
I've been thinking about something.

00:35.864 --> 00:37.747
About why you're not feeling any better.

00:37.783 --> 00:38.998
I think it's about Lori.

00:39.034 --> 00:40.834
About her being our biological mother.

00:40.869 --> 00:42.619
I couldn't get pregnant.

00:42.671 --> 00:44.204
And we decided to look for an egg donor.

00:44.206 --> 00:45.505
They chose me.

00:45.540 --> 00:46.623
Lori told us the truth,

00:46.675 --> 00:48.875
and then things just started to fall apart.

00:48.877 --> 00:51.795
Like with Max and mom and dad.

00:51.847 --> 00:53.379
I hate that she's my mother.

00:53.381 --> 00:54.547
Please don't shut us out.

00:54.599 --> 00:55.882
It's okay.

00:57.185 --> 00:58.384
It's about Lori.

00:58.436 --> 01:00.220
She tried to kill herself.

01:02.791 --> 01:04.541
Hey. Morning.

01:04.593 --> 01:06.042
- Good morning. 
- Coffee?

01:06.094 --> 01:08.261
Mmm. Thank you.

01:08.296 --> 01:09.546
Carter come down yet?

01:09.598 --> 01:10.463
No.

01:10.465 --> 01:11.631
She didn't sleep.

01:11.683 --> 01:14.851
Her light was on all night.

01:14.886 --> 01:16.970
Every time I think we're
finally done with Lori,

01:17.022 --> 01:20.139
she manages to find a way to
worm her way back into our lives.

01:20.192 --> 01:21.641
Yes, she does.

01:21.643 --> 01:23.643
But I'm worried about Carter

01:23.645 --> 01:25.862
and why she didn't want to talk last night.

01:25.897 --> 01:27.514
She's probably in shock.

01:30.118 --> 01:32.906
No, I can't, I'm sorry.

01:32.931 --> 01:34.714
No, look, I've made up my mind.

01:34.739 --> 01:37.290
Okay. Bye.

01:37.325 --> 01:38.156
Who was that?

01:38.181 --> 01:40.078
Lori's doctor.

01:40.829 --> 01:42.495
He wants me to come and meet him.

01:42.497 --> 01:43.880
- Why? 
- Because they always try

01:43.915 --> 01:46.165
and talk to the family after
something like this happens.

01:46.218 --> 01:48.334
Well, she's not really our family.

01:48.386 --> 01:49.502
Yeah, I know, Taylor.

01:49.554 --> 01:50.981
That's not what he was saying.

01:51.006 --> 01:52.389
Well, then what was he saying?

01:52.934 --> 01:54.674
I think it's pretty simple, Carter.

01:54.726 --> 01:57.427
She's insane. She always has been.

01:57.479 --> 01:59.312
Okay, yeah, well.

01:59.347 --> 02:01.648
I think there's a little
more to it than that.

02:01.683 --> 02:03.066
You're not going, are you?

02:03.101 --> 02:05.685
No, I made plans with Max.

02:05.687 --> 02:08.488
He was always good to talk
to when nothing made sense.

02:08.523 --> 02:10.740
Yeah. Yeah, he's the best.

02:10.775 --> 02:13.076
All right. I'll see you later.

02:13.111 --> 02:14.861
Hey, Carter.

02:14.913 --> 02:17.030
Mom and grandma and I are
doing that charity thing

02:17.082 --> 02:18.915
at the country club tonight.

02:18.950 --> 02:20.080
Will you be there?

02:20.105 --> 02:21.971
Oh, um... yeah.

02:21.996 --> 02:23.496
See you there.

02:26.735 --> 02:29.536
Hey. Look who's here.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.905
What's the matter? You
look like someone died.

02:33.071 --> 02:33.907
Not quite.

02:33.959 --> 02:35.459
What does that mean?

02:35.875 --> 02:37.327
Lori tried to kill herself.

02:37.379 --> 02:39.413
- What? 
- They found her in time.

02:39.465 --> 02:40.547
I don't understand.

02:40.583 --> 02:43.083
She was fine, I thought
she was doing better.

02:43.085 --> 02:45.636
- Have you talked to her?
- No, and I'm not going to.

02:45.671 --> 02:47.754
- Why not? 
- Because I'm not getting

02:47.756 --> 02:49.089
sucked into her drama again.

02:49.091 --> 02:50.641
That is exactly what she wants.

02:50.676 --> 02:52.926
She's obviously sick.

02:54.680 --> 02:56.430
Seriously, if she had
cancer, would you abandon her?

02:56.482 --> 02:58.732
That is not the same
thing, and you know it.

02:58.767 --> 03:00.100
You can't even compare those two.

03:00.152 --> 03:01.352
It's obviously mental illness.

03:01.353 --> 03:03.437
You guys act like she
has control over this.

03:05.774 --> 03:07.107
Look, I know she's done awful things,

03:07.109 --> 03:09.276
I get that, but...

03:09.328 --> 03:11.361
I mean, she could have died, and you're

03:11.413 --> 03:14.031
acting like you wouldn't have even cared.

It's not a good idea.

03:46.982 --> 03:49.399
- What? 
- You going up there to see Lori.

03:49.451 --> 03:51.318
Madison doesn't know what it's like

03:51.320 --> 03:53.036
to be lied to for all those years.

03:53.072 --> 03:54.238
It's not just about what Madison said.

03:54.290 --> 03:56.990
Carter, I know how much Lori meant to you.

03:56.992 --> 03:58.825
You don't owe her anything.

03:58.878 --> 04:00.294
She's not your responsibility.

04:00.329 --> 04:03.163
Look, the doctor just wants
to ask me some questions, okay?

04:03.165 --> 04:05.132
Maybe I could tell him
something that would help her.

04:05.167 --> 04:06.550
I get that.

04:06.585 --> 04:08.385
Would you take me?

04:08.420 --> 04:10.837
If that's what you want.

04:15.261 --> 04:17.511
Yeah, that's what I want.

04:18.930 --> 04:21.098
Why does it look like a beauty pageant

04:21.149 --> 04:22.432
blew up in my house?

04:22.484 --> 04:23.567
Um, fundraiser?

04:23.602 --> 04:25.652
Charity fundraiser at the country club

04:25.688 --> 04:26.937
this afternoon, you remember?

04:26.989 --> 04:28.572
I completely forgot.

04:28.607 --> 04:30.607
Well, it's been a little nuts around here.

04:30.659 --> 04:34.027
Taylor told me that crazy
has reared her head yet again?

04:34.079 --> 04:36.163
I mean, what was that woman thinking?

04:36.198 --> 04:37.698
Can you imagine doing something like that?

04:37.750 --> 04:40.167
- Thankfully, no. 
- You guys are never gonna believe this.

04:40.202 --> 04:42.869
- What? 
- Max just called me.

04:42.871 --> 04:44.087
He and Carter are on their way

04:44.123 --> 04:46.506
to the mental hospital
to talk to Lori's doctor.

04:46.542 --> 04:48.375
What? No, I talked to Carter this morning.

04:48.377 --> 04:50.677
She wasn't even thinking about doing that.

04:50.713 --> 04:52.679
Well, now she is.

04:52.715 --> 04:53.964
Voicemail.

04:54.016 --> 04:55.299
Carter, it's me.

04:55.351 --> 04:57.884
Please, when you get
this, will you call me?

04:57.886 --> 04:59.553
I'm worried.

04:59.605 --> 05:02.105
- Where's your dad? 
- He went to the office.

05:02.141 --> 05:03.807
Honey, I am so sorry,
but I don't think that

05:03.859 --> 05:05.309
- I can do this today. 
- What?

05:05.361 --> 05:06.944
- I'm chair of the committee.
- I understand that,

05:06.979 --> 05:09.896
but I think that we need to
go up there and be with Carter.

05:09.949 --> 05:11.732
- I'm sorry. 
- No.

05:11.784 --> 05:13.150
No, Lori doesn't get to do this.

05:13.202 --> 05:16.570
She doesn't get to stop our lives

05:16.622 --> 05:18.782
every time she does something crazy.

05:18.807 --> 05:20.705
She's right... otherwise, we're
just playing right into her hands.

05:20.730 --> 05:22.588
But this isn't about Lori.

05:22.613 --> 05:24.195
This is about Carter.

05:24.730 --> 05:27.147
Carter didn't ask you to come.

05:27.182 --> 05:29.099
She didn't even tell you she was going.

05:30.562 --> 05:34.070
Mom, I'm sorry, I just...

05:34.094 --> 05:36.511
I made a commitment, and I'm not gonna

05:36.536 --> 05:39.537
disappoint people because of
something this crazy woman did.

05:42.707 --> 05:44.073
You're right.

05:45.543 --> 05:47.620
You're absolutely right.

05:47.645 --> 05:48.978
I'm sorry.

05:49.003 --> 05:50.553
You look beautiful.

05:50.578 --> 05:51.847
Thanks.

05:57.589 --> 05:59.171
(Lori, echoing) Carter.

05:59.173 --> 06:00.723
Carter...

06:03.061 --> 06:04.727
It's okay, mommy's here.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:19.244 --> 06:21.027
What are those?

06:21.079 --> 06:23.696
Her letters.

06:23.698 --> 06:26.115
She's been writing me, like, twice a week.

06:26.167 --> 06:28.701
What do they say?

06:28.753 --> 06:30.703
I don't know, I never open them.

06:36.027 --> 06:38.424
I don't know David, maybe you 
should go after her.

06:38.449 --> 06:39.954
Liz, I don't think that's,
the way to handle it. After.

06:39.979 --> 06:41.622
We both know Carter, and if she didn't

06:41.647 --> 06:44.147
ask one of us to go, it's because she...

06:44.183 --> 06:45.349
wants to handle it on her own.

06:45.351 --> 06:46.733
I just don't get what that doctor thinks

06:46.769 --> 06:48.018
that she can tell him.

06:48.020 --> 06:50.187
I spoke to him, and he thinks it will help.

06:50.189 --> 06:51.905
Well, his priority is Lori, not Carter.

06:51.941 --> 06:54.157
No. He seemed concerned for everyone.

06:54.193 --> 06:57.244
If he was concerned about Carter, he
would never have asked her to go up there.

06:57.279 --> 06:59.329
I've been to those places, David.

06:59.365 --> 07:01.198
- They're horrible. 
- She's with Max.

07:01.250 --> 07:02.416
She'll be all right.

07:02.451 --> 07:04.084
Lori doesn't deserve her.

07:04.119 --> 07:07.788
Liz, I know you're afraid,
but she's coming back.

07:07.840 --> 07:09.039
She's ours.

07:09.041 --> 07:10.571
Yours and mine.

07:12.594 --> 07:14.127
If I'd have written back even once,

07:14.179 --> 07:15.345
she might not have done this.

07:15.381 --> 07:18.632
No, Carter, she's in an institution.

07:18.684 --> 07:20.434
You can't hold yourself responsible

07:20.469 --> 07:21.635
for Lori hurting herself.

07:21.687 --> 07:23.553
Yeah, but I should have answered her.

07:23.555 --> 07:27.274
Well, you went through
a huge ordeal with her.

07:27.309 --> 07:29.359
And you're allowed time to figure that out.

07:29.395 --> 07:32.396
Yeah. Except I didn't take
any time to figure it out.

07:32.398 --> 07:34.898
I shoved it all the way in
a drawer to cope with later.

07:34.950 --> 07:36.483
13 years you've lived with her,

07:36.535 --> 07:39.903
and you had no idea
what was really going on.

07:39.955 --> 07:42.205
Hurting herself was her choice.

07:42.241 --> 07:44.408
Nothing you did made her do it.

07:46.245 --> 07:47.744
(Lori, echoing) Carter.

07:47.796 --> 07:49.746
Carter...

07:52.418 --> 07:54.918
Carter, baby. Hey. Wake up.

07:54.920 --> 07:56.136
Mommy, what's wrong?

07:56.171 --> 07:58.555
I just had a really bad dream.

07:58.590 --> 08:00.140
I dreamed that we were
in a huge crowd of people,

08:00.175 --> 08:01.758
and I was afraid I lost you.

08:01.760 --> 08:03.010
No. I'm right here.

08:03.062 --> 08:04.561
Yeah. Yes, you are.

08:04.596 --> 08:06.563
You're right here. Good as gold.

08:06.598 --> 08:08.849
Oh, I'm sorry I woke you up.

08:08.901 --> 08:10.901
It's okay, mommy. I'm
sorry you had a bad dream.

08:10.936 --> 08:13.603
It's just that there's
this lady across the hall,

08:13.655 --> 08:15.439
you know, the one that gave
you candy the other day?

08:15.491 --> 08:17.407
- Mm-hmm. 
- There's something about her.

08:17.443 --> 08:19.443
The way she watches us just makes me...

08:19.495 --> 08:20.744
Makes me a little scared.

08:20.779 --> 08:23.947
So I think it's time to leave this place.

08:23.999 --> 08:26.083
We're gonna move again?

08:26.118 --> 08:27.918
Yeah. Yeah, we're gonna...

08:27.953 --> 08:31.455
We're gonna blow this one-Starbucks town.

08:31.507 --> 08:33.289
And you know what? Before I
tell you where we're headed,

08:33.342 --> 08:34.582
we're gonna play a little game.

08:34.592 --> 08:37.177
- What game? 
- We're gonna play a game

08:37.212 --> 08:39.846
in which we only have 20 minutes

08:39.881 --> 08:41.965
to pack everything
we're gonna take with us.

08:42.017 --> 08:43.799
- Right now? 
- And know this.

08:43.802 --> 08:46.303
Anything that can't fit in the suitcase

08:46.305 --> 08:48.105
has to stay behind for good.

08:48.140 --> 08:49.689
Come on, set, go!

08:49.725 --> 08:51.308
Go, go, go!

08:56.231 --> 08:57.781
Are you okay?

08:58.266 --> 09:00.984
I just wish the timing of
this pageant wasn't so bad.

09:01.036 --> 09:02.486
I think mom's really freaking out.

09:02.488 --> 09:04.821
Yeah, how are you doing, hmm?

09:05.399 --> 09:07.657
Oh, I'm fine.

09:07.891 --> 09:09.543
I have more important things to worry about

09:09.578 --> 09:11.545
than Lori's mental problems.

09:11.580 --> 09:13.830
This is a joke, right?

09:15.870 --> 09:18.321
Mom, that is so...

09:18.554 --> 09:21.505
If the word you're looking
for is "slutty," I agree.

09:21.507 --> 09:22.722
I'm not wearing this.

09:22.758 --> 09:24.841
Oh, you're kidding. You look fantastic.

09:24.893 --> 09:25.926
(Doorbell)

09:26.543 --> 09:29.460
By all means, let me get it.

09:35.687 --> 09:37.487
- Oh, hey. 
- Hey.

09:37.523 --> 09:39.673
- Come on in. 
- Thank you.

09:39.698 --> 09:41.585
(Clearing throat) Wow.

09:41.610 --> 09:44.277
Ask him what he thinks.

09:44.329 --> 09:45.745
What's up?

09:45.781 --> 09:48.448
There's this great new Thai restaurant

09:48.500 --> 09:49.749
that just opened up in my neighborhood,

09:49.785 --> 09:52.669
so I was thinking we
could have dinner later.

09:52.704 --> 09:54.337
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

09:54.373 --> 09:57.874
Oh, Kyle, I'm sorry, but
this isn't a good night.

09:57.926 --> 10:00.927
I have a lot going on, and Carter...

10:00.963 --> 10:02.462
Well, it's a long story,

10:02.514 --> 10:05.298
and I'm a little bit
wrapped up at the moment.

10:05.350 --> 10:07.050
Liz, are you coming?

10:07.052 --> 10:09.603
No matter how much I'd
rather be doing anything else.

10:09.638 --> 10:11.805
You know what? It's okay.

10:11.857 --> 10:13.390
We could just do it another time.

10:13.442 --> 10:15.392
Alterations now, please?

10:15.444 --> 10:18.395
- Wow. 
- So, we'll talk soon?

10:18.447 --> 10:20.197
Yes. Definitely.

10:20.232 --> 10:22.149
And um, yeah,

10:22.201 --> 10:26.153
someday I would love to see
that dress in all of its glory.

10:30.826 --> 10:32.409
No answer?

10:32.411 --> 10:34.377
I feel bad, I just want to apologize.

10:34.413 --> 10:35.413
You will.

10:35.464 --> 10:37.414
Carter's not the type to hold a grudge.

10:37.416 --> 10:39.916
I just hated hearing them badmouth Lori.

10:39.968 --> 10:41.168
I don't know, mad.

10:41.220 --> 10:44.221
Double kidnapping, suicide?

10:44.256 --> 10:46.139
I'm kind of thinking it's well-deserved.

10:46.175 --> 10:47.891
Yeah.

10:47.926 --> 10:49.926
- I don't know anymore. 
- What do you mean?

10:51.153 --> 10:52.986
She sent me here.

10:55.901 --> 10:57.767
Lori... I mean,

10:57.769 --> 10:59.352
she asked me to come to see Carter,

10:59.404 --> 11:01.488
and that's why I showed up out of nowhere.

11:01.523 --> 11:04.357
I thought you came because
your parents kicked you out.

11:04.409 --> 11:05.942
They did.

11:05.994 --> 11:08.278
And when I told Lori, she's the one who...

11:08.280 --> 11:09.946
told me to come, she said that...

11:09.998 --> 11:11.448
Carter and I could find a place together,

11:11.500 --> 11:13.617
and I think she was just trying to get me

11:13.619 --> 11:16.786
to lure Carter away from the Wilsons.

11:16.788 --> 11:20.123
Wow. That is diabolical.

11:20.125 --> 11:22.425
Then she asked if I could

11:22.461 --> 11:26.630
convince Carter to forgive her.

11:27.966 --> 11:29.966
I just feel like I might have been used.

11:30.018 --> 11:33.053
I think that's maybe something
that Carter should know.

11:34.139 --> 11:35.855
I know, I'm gonna tell her.

11:35.891 --> 11:38.642
I didn't think that Lori would go this far.

11:38.694 --> 11:40.810
I honestly thought that I was helping her.

11:44.283 --> 11:47.200
Well, I have an idea.

11:47.236 --> 11:50.203
There's an event tonight
at my parents' country club.

11:50.239 --> 11:51.350
Yeah?

11:51.375 --> 11:54.457
And Taylor's on a committee

11:54.493 --> 11:57.210
for some charity fashion show or something,

11:57.246 --> 11:58.828
and Carter's gonna be there.

11:58.880 --> 12:00.580
We should go.

12:13.645 --> 12:15.979
What's that for?

12:16.014 --> 12:17.480
This is gonna suck

12:17.516 --> 12:19.099
all that mean little bee poison

12:19.151 --> 12:21.067
that hurts so much right out of your arm.

12:21.103 --> 12:22.319
How?

12:22.354 --> 12:23.903
I don't know how it works.

12:23.939 --> 12:24.854
It just does.

12:24.856 --> 12:26.823
See? Doesn't that feel better already?

12:26.858 --> 12:29.776
A little, but what if there's another bee?

12:29.828 --> 12:31.695
Well, that's where I come in.

12:31.697 --> 12:33.530
I will always take care of you

12:33.532 --> 12:36.833
no matter how many bees
there are, I promise.

12:36.868 --> 12:38.201
Me too.

12:38.203 --> 12:40.503
You too what?

12:40.539 --> 12:42.789
I'll always take care of you, mommy.

12:48.347 --> 12:50.213
You okay?

12:51.883 --> 12:53.216
Yeah.

12:53.268 --> 12:55.935
I keep remembering things.

12:55.971 --> 12:59.389
I think she was sick all along, Max.

12:59.391 --> 13:01.024
Like, her whole life.

13:01.059 --> 13:04.060
It's important to tell the doctor that.

13:04.062 --> 13:06.446
It might help.

13:06.481 --> 13:07.864
Carter?

13:07.899 --> 13:09.199
I'm Dr Fox.

13:09.234 --> 13:10.234
Hi.

13:13.238 --> 13:15.288
I think I'd like to see her.

13:17.409 --> 13:19.326
Could you let her know I'm here?

13:19.378 --> 13:21.294
♪ I'd hold the world ♪

13:21.330 --> 13:24.748
♪ Hold the world ♪

13:27.153 --> 13:29.010
Are you sure this is what you want?

13:29.035 --> 13:30.151
I have to, Max.

13:30.203 --> 13:31.402
Don't let her mess with you anymore.

13:31.454 --> 13:33.154
No, I won't, I promise.

13:33.206 --> 13:35.072
Do you know what you want out of this?

13:35.074 --> 13:36.741
No.

13:38.711 --> 13:40.461
But Max, that woman raised me.

13:40.496 --> 13:44.165
She's such a huge part of who I am.

13:44.217 --> 13:45.383
Look.

13:45.418 --> 13:48.135
If she had actually killed herself

13:48.171 --> 13:49.553
and I had never seen her again,

13:49.589 --> 13:52.923
I just know I would spend
the rest of my life wondering

13:52.975 --> 13:55.926
why on earth I didn't at
least try and help her.

13:58.431 --> 14:00.731
Please, can you understand that?

14:00.767 --> 14:02.016
Yeah, I can.

14:02.068 --> 14:04.101
And I do.

14:04.103 --> 14:06.270
You don't know what condition she's in,

14:06.322 --> 14:08.739
so you gotta look out for yourself, okay?

14:08.775 --> 14:10.024
Okay, look.

14:10.076 --> 14:11.609
Let's just talk to the doctor.

14:11.611 --> 14:14.445
If he doesn't think I should
go in, then I won't, I promise.

14:15.832 --> 14:16.947
Okay.

14:16.999 --> 14:19.617
This is a big deal.

14:19.669 --> 14:20.918
Too much?

14:20.953 --> 14:21.953
No, no, it's great.

14:22.004 --> 14:23.754
We should get on the
list for hair and make-up.

14:23.790 --> 14:25.790
You know, I do not want a rush job.

14:25.842 --> 14:29.210
Well, I have to call
Carter again and David,

14:29.262 --> 14:32.797
and a drink would not be the worst idea.

14:32.849 --> 14:34.932
I'm sure there's some
champagne around here somewhere.

14:34.967 --> 14:36.217
Yeah, that's not gonna cut it.

14:36.269 --> 14:38.636
Honey? I'll be right back.

14:38.688 --> 14:40.521
Okay, great. Great, okay.

14:40.556 --> 14:43.641
She was here for three seconds.

14:44.694 --> 14:46.310
Nice digs.

14:46.362 --> 14:48.229
Welcome to West Oak.

14:48.281 --> 14:50.281
Playground to the rich and judgmental.

14:50.316 --> 14:52.316
You two are a refreshing sight.

14:52.368 --> 14:54.318
Oh, I didn't know you were working today.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.537
You guys look like twins, that's cute.

14:56.572 --> 14:58.622
You say that like you don't really mean it.

14:58.658 --> 15:01.158
Wrong. I actually love men in uniform.

15:01.210 --> 15:02.660
Even a polyester one?

15:02.662 --> 15:05.212
I'm Madison. I'm with her.

15:05.248 --> 15:07.164
This is Damon. Have you guys seen Carter?

15:07.166 --> 15:09.633
No, no. She'll probably show up, though.

15:09.669 --> 15:11.635
Taylor put this whole thing together.

15:11.671 --> 15:15.639
All right. How about, uh,
calamari and two mimosas?

15:15.675 --> 15:17.475
I got you on the calamari,

15:17.510 --> 15:20.060
but the new manager has the alcohol

15:20.096 --> 15:21.846
on high security lockdown.

15:21.898 --> 15:23.314
- What? 
- Apparently...

15:23.349 --> 15:25.900
Someone's been pilfering the liquor
from behind the bar after hours.

15:25.935 --> 15:27.601
Yeah, that'd be me.

15:29.238 --> 15:30.855
Wow.

15:32.191 --> 15:33.441
Damn.

15:33.493 --> 15:35.326
Damon shows some hidden depth, okay.

15:35.361 --> 15:38.028
We'll have a calamari and two mixers, then.

15:38.030 --> 15:40.448
Young man? Young man.

15:40.500 --> 15:42.917
- Hmm? 
- We're waiting on our menus.

15:44.587 --> 15:47.421
- Save me. 
- Save us.

15:50.092 --> 15:51.876
So, are you impressed?

15:51.928 --> 15:56.263
We're surrounded by grandmas
and screaming children.

15:56.299 --> 15:57.965
Oh, yeah.

16:00.269 --> 16:01.635
Uh-oh.

16:01.687 --> 16:04.021
Looks like the country
club gossip about my parents

16:04.056 --> 16:05.056
is in full swing.

16:05.057 --> 16:06.057
What? Where?

16:06.108 --> 16:08.108
- Doesn't matter. 
- Yeah, it does.

16:09.779 --> 16:11.562
Can we help you?

16:12.698 --> 16:15.032
- Yeah, I thought so. 
- Wow,

16:15.067 --> 16:16.067
thank you for that.

16:16.118 --> 16:18.402
I'm sorry your parents left
you in the line of fire.

16:18.404 --> 16:19.820
Thanks, but I'm used to it.

16:19.872 --> 16:22.907
Yeah, I get the whole
unexpected orphan gig.

16:22.909 --> 16:26.043
When my parents found out
I was gay and made it clear

16:26.078 --> 16:27.411
that they didn't support me,

16:27.413 --> 16:29.463
I had no one.

16:29.499 --> 16:31.248
Well, I mean, except Lori.

16:31.250 --> 16:32.716
She was nice to you, huh?

16:32.752 --> 16:34.552
Yeah, that's why it's hard.

16:34.587 --> 16:36.337
I don't know what to think now.

16:36.389 --> 16:40.424
To be honest, I've never met
an adult who hasn't let me down.

16:40.476 --> 16:42.927
Not one.

16:42.929 --> 16:45.596
Maybe that's why fate brought us together.

16:45.598 --> 16:47.515
To soften the blow.

16:50.269 --> 16:51.602
I wonder where Carter is.

16:53.439 --> 16:55.523
She talks about you a great deal.

16:55.575 --> 16:57.741
I think it would be
helpful for her to see you.

16:57.777 --> 17:00.327
- How's she doing? 
- We're keeping a close eye on her.

17:00.363 --> 17:02.417
She's stable. Resting.

17:02.442 --> 17:04.489
I thought the whole point of
putting her in a mental facility

17:04.513 --> 17:06.666
was to help her get better.
How does this happen?

17:06.702 --> 17:08.786
We put her on a new regimen of meds,

17:08.838 --> 17:10.503
and as those drugs do their work,

17:10.540 --> 17:12.790
smoothing out the chemical
imbalance in her brain,

17:12.842 --> 17:15.459
she's come to understand
a new reality of her life.

17:15.461 --> 17:18.178
That sometimes can be overwhelming.

17:19.682 --> 17:21.265
I want to warn you.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.601
There's some bruising on her neck,

17:23.636 --> 17:25.135
and she's on a mild sedative,

17:25.137 --> 17:27.304
so she may seem a bit cloudy.

17:27.356 --> 17:30.941
Okay.

17:30.977 --> 17:32.810
I'll be right here.

17:59.805 --> 18:01.255
You shouldn't have come.

18:14.153 --> 18:16.186
Well, I wanted to.

18:21.118 --> 18:23.501
Would you please look at me?

18:25.155 --> 18:26.765
I mean it.

18:26.790 --> 18:29.341
I don't want you here.

18:35.553 --> 18:38.638
Well, you might not want me here,

18:38.663 --> 18:40.697
but I wanted to be here.

18:40.699 --> 18:43.199
You never answered any of my letters.

18:43.251 --> 18:44.701
Why show up now?

18:44.753 --> 18:47.704
Because I am worried about you.

18:49.341 --> 18:51.508
Why did you try and hurt yourself?

18:51.543 --> 18:53.877
I should have done it a long time ago.

18:53.929 --> 18:54.761
Don't say that.

18:54.796 --> 18:57.849
Why? Now they've got me on meds.

18:57.874 --> 19:00.133
It's all becoming very clear.

19:00.185 --> 19:04.187
In fact, for the first time
in a very, very long time,

19:04.222 --> 19:07.140
I am seeing everything...

19:08.977 --> 19:11.945
Like I just woke up from a bad dream.

19:11.980 --> 19:15.148
Okay. Well, maybe that's a good thing.

19:15.200 --> 19:16.533
Good thing? I look around,

19:16.568 --> 19:19.702
and all I see is the hurt I
have caused so many people.

19:19.738 --> 19:22.071
Most importantly, you.

19:29.414 --> 19:32.388
Everybody makes mistakes.

19:35.255 --> 19:37.887
That doesn't mean your
life isn't worth living.

19:37.923 --> 19:39.923
You make it sound like I accidentally

19:39.975 --> 19:42.425
left the bathtub running.

19:42.427 --> 19:43.977
I know what I did,

19:44.012 --> 19:48.181
and now all I want is for you to go

19:48.233 --> 19:50.016
and move on with your life

19:50.068 --> 19:52.735
and try to forget that
I stole 13 years of it

19:52.771 --> 19:55.005
from you for my own selfish reasons.

19:59.611 --> 20:02.495
Listen, David, do me a favor,

20:02.530 --> 20:06.249
and will you let me know
if you hear from her?

20:06.284 --> 20:08.117
Okay, bye.

20:15.543 --> 20:17.760
- Need a refill, Mrs. Wilson? 
- Oh, hey, Gabe.

20:17.796 --> 20:18.628
Uh, no.

20:18.680 --> 20:20.463
This one and a good pout,

20:20.465 --> 20:21.631
and I should be fine.

20:21.683 --> 20:24.467
My dad tells me that I
was an olympic level pouter

20:24.519 --> 20:26.519
when my mom would try to
get me to eat my veggies.

20:26.554 --> 20:27.637
And did that work?

20:27.639 --> 20:29.105
My guess is no,

20:29.140 --> 20:30.773
but I don't really remember.

20:30.809 --> 20:32.108
Think about your mom a lot?

20:32.143 --> 20:34.644
Yeah. I do.

20:34.696 --> 20:36.145
I like to talk about her sometimes.

20:36.197 --> 20:37.897
Yeah.

20:37.949 --> 20:39.532
So you're going out with my dad later?

20:39.567 --> 20:41.818
No, I have to be home and see Carter.

20:41.870 --> 20:44.037
Oh, did he tell you
why he wanted to go out?

20:44.072 --> 20:45.204
No. Why.

20:45.240 --> 20:46.823
He's selling our house.

20:46.875 --> 20:49.459
I think he wants to put
out a few feelers, you know,

20:49.494 --> 20:52.161
see if you'd think about
getting a place with him.

20:52.213 --> 20:53.830
Oh.

20:53.882 --> 20:57.417
Um, how do you feel about that, then?

20:57.469 --> 20:59.002
Selling your house?

20:59.004 --> 21:00.303
I don't mind it.

21:00.338 --> 21:02.005
My mom's been gone a long time.

21:02.057 --> 21:04.507
Problem is that I think
he's mostly doing it for you.

21:04.559 --> 21:06.592
I think that he wants you to be ready

21:06.645 --> 21:08.011
for something more serious.

21:08.063 --> 21:09.762
From where I'm standing,

21:10.177 --> 21:11.848
maybe you are, and maybe you aren't.

21:11.850 --> 21:15.852
Things are very complicated.

21:15.904 --> 21:18.905
Yeah, well, most everything in life is,

21:18.940 --> 21:22.191
but the people who want to be together

21:22.243 --> 21:24.577
tend to make it work,

21:24.612 --> 21:25.828
so I'm just saying,

21:25.864 --> 21:28.865
maybe the whole complicated thing is...

21:28.917 --> 21:30.083
Just an excuse.

21:35.423 --> 21:37.540
Hey. I didn't know you guys were coming.

21:37.592 --> 21:39.759
We decided to support the cause.

21:39.794 --> 21:41.427
Plus, it's one of the few places

21:41.463 --> 21:43.212
my outlaw parents still have credit.

21:43.214 --> 21:44.347
Nice 'do.

21:44.382 --> 21:45.848
Joining the pageant circuit?

21:45.884 --> 21:47.050
Funny. Have you guys heard from Carter?

21:47.052 --> 21:49.552
Uh, no. Have you? I thought she was coming.

21:49.604 --> 21:51.604
Well, she was supposed to be here.

21:51.639 --> 21:54.390
Yeah, but instead, she
went to the mental hospital.

21:54.442 --> 21:55.692
She did? To see Lori?

21:55.727 --> 21:58.561
No. To talk to the doctor.

21:58.563 --> 22:00.897
Whatever.

22:00.949 --> 22:02.065
I have to find my mom.

22:02.067 --> 22:03.733
She's next to get shellacked.

22:03.735 --> 22:05.735
Miss Castro. How are you today?

22:05.787 --> 22:08.905
I am wonderful. How are you, Chad?

22:08.957 --> 22:11.708
Actually, I'm afraid I
have some unfortunate news.

22:11.743 --> 22:13.710
I take it from your
presence here this afternoon,

22:13.745 --> 22:15.328
you weren't aware that your parents'

22:15.380 --> 22:16.879
membership has been suspended.

22:16.915 --> 22:18.581
What? Why?

22:18.583 --> 22:19.583
You're kidding, right?

22:19.634 --> 22:20.717
I'm sorry, who are you?

22:20.752 --> 22:22.085
That's my granddaughter.

22:22.137 --> 22:23.553
What seems to be the problem, Chad?

22:23.588 --> 22:25.471
Mrs. Marshall, I was just discussing

22:25.507 --> 22:27.473
membership guidelines
with these young ladies.

22:27.509 --> 22:29.425
Her parents haven't paid the Piper.

22:29.477 --> 22:30.760
Oh, right, I heard about that.

22:30.762 --> 22:32.562
That's fine, we shouldn't've
come, we'll just leave.

22:32.597 --> 22:34.514
No, no. I was instructed

22:34.566 --> 22:35.681
to ask them to move along.

22:35.734 --> 22:37.483
Well, they will, to my table.

22:37.519 --> 22:39.185
They'll be my guests.

22:39.237 --> 22:41.687
Um, you girls make yourself
comfortable over there

22:41.740 --> 22:43.106
and let me know if you
have any more problems,

22:43.158 --> 22:47.276
which I really don't anticipate
them having, do you, Chad?

22:47.328 --> 22:48.890
Of course not.

22:51.416 --> 22:53.783
Gammy.

22:59.124 --> 23:01.624
Look, I...

23:01.676 --> 23:05.845
Can't imagine how alone
you must feel in here.

23:05.880 --> 23:09.849
I'm so sorry I didn't
visit or write you back.

23:13.138 --> 23:15.772
I should've.

23:15.807 --> 23:17.409
I'm glad you didn't.

23:18.901 --> 23:20.359
I needed time away from you

23:20.395 --> 23:22.528
to be able to see the truth.

23:22.917 --> 23:25.198
Okay... Lori?

23:26.693 --> 23:28.443
Yes.

23:28.587 --> 23:32.339
Mistakes have been made
by everybody involved,

23:32.540 --> 23:34.991
but your whole life hasn't been a mistake.

23:35.043 --> 23:39.162
We had a life together, my whole childhood.

23:43.218 --> 23:45.468
That wasn't a mistake.

23:45.503 --> 23:47.053
Yes, it was.

23:47.088 --> 23:49.305
Because I had no right to it.

23:49.340 --> 23:50.673
I was not your mom.

23:50.725 --> 23:52.758
Yes, you were.

23:52.811 --> 23:55.678
Back then, you were my mom.

23:55.730 --> 23:57.847
And you know what? You
did some things right.

23:59.838 --> 24:03.686
So kind and so loving.

24:03.738 --> 24:07.690
And yes, everything is
really different now.

24:09.244 --> 24:12.028
But I still remember all that stuff.

24:12.030 --> 24:14.363
You need to leave, Carter.

24:15.700 --> 24:16.833
No, I'm not gonna leave.

24:16.868 --> 24:18.868
I need to be alone, go away.

24:18.870 --> 24:20.036
- Would you please stop saying that? 
- Leave me alone...

24:20.038 --> 24:21.370
I am begging you. Carter,

24:21.372 --> 24:23.456
I think Lori needs to rest.

24:34.385 --> 24:36.052
I love you.

24:38.273 --> 24:40.890
And you love me more.

24:43.811 --> 24:46.229
Tell me you love me more.

24:48.483 --> 24:50.233
Carter, please.

24:56.541 --> 24:57.907
Did you hear that?

24:57.959 --> 25:00.293
She said she loved me.

25:00.328 --> 25:01.878
She said I was her mom.

25:01.913 --> 25:04.130
The doctor heard her say it.

25:06.968 --> 25:08.918
I knew she would come.

25:10.922 --> 25:13.256
I knew she loved me.

25:17.392 --> 25:19.359
Look, I just need to ask her something.

25:19.384 --> 25:21.885
You always let me talk to
her, and it's important.

25:21.887 --> 25:23.270
I don't understand why
she's not calling me back.

25:23.305 --> 25:26.606
I told you, Madison,
she's on a 72-hour watch.

25:26.642 --> 25:29.809
But she told me to tell
you she's all right.

25:29.861 --> 25:31.227
She'll be in touch.

25:32.481 --> 25:34.064
Okay.

25:36.535 --> 25:39.235
Hi... wow.

25:39.288 --> 25:40.870
Wow.

25:40.906 --> 25:42.739
Oh, so I spoke to the doctor,

25:42.791 --> 25:45.375
and Carter saw Lori, she's on her way back.

25:45.410 --> 25:46.910
Good.

25:46.962 --> 25:48.703
Thank you for telling me.

25:49.665 --> 25:51.047
Wait, she saw her?

25:51.083 --> 25:54.301
I thought that she was just
going to talk to the doctor.

25:54.336 --> 25:57.053
This is unbelievable. She
should have been here with us.

25:57.089 --> 25:58.638
Honey, it's not her fault.

25:58.674 --> 26:00.507
No, I'm not blaming her.

26:00.559 --> 26:01.758
It's that woman.

26:01.810 --> 26:04.477
Every time we try and have

26:04.513 --> 26:05.595
some kind of normal life,

26:05.647 --> 26:08.148
and she has to pull Carter away.

26:08.183 --> 26:10.183
I hate her.

26:10.235 --> 26:12.902
I wish that...

26:12.938 --> 26:13.938
What?

26:16.575 --> 26:18.825
I wish she'd done a better job.

26:19.945 --> 26:22.612
I don't care if I do have her blood.

26:22.614 --> 26:24.914
I wish she was dead.

26:24.950 --> 26:25.865
I do.

26:25.917 --> 26:27.617
Okay, the show's about ready to start.

26:27.619 --> 26:28.952
Are we ready?

26:28.954 --> 26:30.503
No, mom, actually, we're not.

26:30.539 --> 26:32.589
No, we are.

26:32.624 --> 26:34.174
She's not gonna mess this up, too.

26:37.295 --> 26:38.345
Mom?

26:41.049 --> 26:42.215
We're ready.

26:45.637 --> 26:47.771
Whoa, nice.

26:47.806 --> 26:49.472
Did you tie that yourself?

26:49.524 --> 26:51.391
Yeah, it's a clip-on.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.360
Didn't know fashion shows were your thing.

26:53.395 --> 26:55.779
Yeah, well, Elizabeth seemed
pretty bummed about doing it

26:55.814 --> 26:57.781
so I figured she could
use some moral support.

26:57.816 --> 27:00.066
Looks like she already has some.

27:01.536 --> 27:02.652
I'm sure he's here for Taylor.

27:02.654 --> 27:05.622
Don't be so sure. Did she ask you to come?

27:05.657 --> 27:07.824
Let me give you a little advice, son.

27:07.826 --> 27:10.460
Don't wait for a woman to
tell you what she wants.

27:10.495 --> 27:12.412
Anticipate their needs.

27:12.464 --> 27:13.880
Trust me on this one.

27:13.915 --> 27:16.332
Now, bartender, how about a beer?

27:16.334 --> 27:17.667
You got it.

27:17.719 --> 27:19.919
Actually, make it two.

27:23.675 --> 27:25.642
Good evening, West Oak.

27:25.677 --> 27:28.595
I'm gonna go find a table.

27:28.647 --> 27:29.896
We are so pleased.

27:29.931 --> 27:32.816
- Here you go, man. 
- Oh, thanks.

27:32.851 --> 27:35.351
Uh, pull up a chair.

27:35.404 --> 27:37.654
(Cheering, applause)

27:37.689 --> 27:41.491

No.

31:43.502 --> 31:46.086
How the hell could I have let this happen?

31:46.138 --> 31:49.005
You didn't let it happen.

31:49.007 --> 31:50.340
It just happened.

31:51.334 --> 31:52.892
God, I hate myself.

31:52.928 --> 31:55.645
Don't go there.

31:55.680 --> 31:58.181
How, Max?

31:58.183 --> 31:59.849
How can I not go there?

31:59.851 --> 32:01.518
It was a bad move.

32:03.071 --> 32:04.988
But you're not alone in this.

32:05.023 --> 32:06.940
I was there, too.

32:06.992 --> 32:08.658
You love Taylor, Max.

32:08.938 --> 32:09.743
I know you do.

32:09.778 --> 32:12.028
And whether or not she's
willing to admit it right now,

32:12.080 --> 32:14.914
I know she loves you, too.

32:14.950 --> 32:17.367
And that's the worst part.

32:17.419 --> 32:20.503
I know she loves you, too,
and I put myself first, again.

32:20.539 --> 32:22.872
You were going through something
that was really difficult.

32:22.874 --> 32:26.225
No, Max. Stop. Don't make excuses for me.

32:26.878 --> 32:28.795
This was my decision.

32:28.847 --> 32:32.549
I guess the apple really
doesn't fall far from the tree.

32:37.750 --> 32:39.366
Um, listen, Tay, before you go out there,

32:39.391 --> 32:43.276
I wanted to talk to you
about what you said earlier.

32:43.311 --> 32:44.944
Listen, I can't make any sense

32:44.980 --> 32:48.782
of what's happening with Carter and Lori.

32:48.817 --> 32:51.734
All I know is that,

32:51.736 --> 32:54.571
for better or worse, Carter
has an attachment to her,

32:54.623 --> 32:58.074
and if I'm gonna be a
good mother to Carter,

32:58.126 --> 33:00.493
better than Lori could ever be,

33:00.545 --> 33:03.797
I have to learn to accept it.

33:05.717 --> 33:09.752
We have to learn to accept it.

33:09.754 --> 33:13.756
No matter how much we want
that woman to disappear,

33:13.809 --> 33:15.925
she's not going to.

33:15.977 --> 33:18.261
She's part of Carter's life.

33:18.263 --> 33:20.551
She's in her heart.

33:21.650 --> 33:24.934
And there's nothing we can do to stop it.

33:24.936 --> 33:27.437
I don't know how to help her.

33:29.441 --> 33:31.741
I don't know what she needs.

33:31.776 --> 33:34.194
Oh, baby.

33:34.246 --> 33:36.613
I don't know how to help her, either.

33:46.091 --> 33:48.091
Hey, superstar.

33:48.126 --> 33:50.009
- You got a minute for a fan? 
- Hey.

33:50.045 --> 33:52.128
I thought I'd surprise you, so surprise.

33:52.130 --> 33:54.013
That's sweet.

33:54.049 --> 33:55.548
So I was thinking maybe
we could high-tail it

33:55.600 --> 33:57.550
back to my place tonight, you know,

33:57.602 --> 34:00.186
unless you got some sort of
A-list after-party to go to.

34:00.222 --> 34:02.305
(Chuckling)

34:02.357 --> 34:05.642
I'd still like to talk
to you about something.

34:07.439 --> 34:09.003
Kyle.

34:10.148 --> 34:12.503
I'd love to, but I can't.

34:15.536 --> 34:16.784
I'm sorry.

34:23.378 --> 34:24.827
Hey.

34:24.829 --> 34:26.829
That was unbelievable...

34:29.251 --> 34:31.251
Oh, my God, did you see Mrs. Everly?

34:31.303 --> 34:32.802
I thought she was gonna have a stroke

34:32.837 --> 34:34.254
right there on the runway.

34:34.306 --> 34:36.226
What is with you still
hanging out there, anyway?

34:36.257 --> 34:38.224
I don't know, it was my parents' place,

34:38.260 --> 34:41.678
and I was a kid there.

34:41.679 --> 34:44.313
Yeah, it's hard to let go of that stuff.

34:44.349 --> 34:46.149
I mean, as lousy as they've been to me,

34:46.184 --> 34:48.234
I do miss my parents sometimes.

34:49.603 --> 34:51.853
I'm sorry Carter didn't show.

34:51.856 --> 34:53.356
Yeah, I hope she's okay.

34:53.358 --> 34:56.025
I'll call her first thing tomorrow morning.

34:56.077 --> 34:57.994
You have to admit, today was fun, though.

34:58.029 --> 35:01.281
Best ladies who lunch date ever.

35:01.333 --> 35:05.034
(Both laughing)

35:05.086 --> 35:06.869
I kind of wish it wasn't a joke.

35:07.264 --> 35:08.338
For real.

35:08.373 --> 35:10.707
Well, I mean, I just..

35:12.544 --> 35:16.212
It's the kind of date that
every girl wants to go on.

35:17.299 --> 35:20.633
We had fashion, drama, Chad.

35:23.136 --> 35:24.769
Well...

35:25.307 --> 35:28.183
If it was a real date,

35:29.561 --> 35:31.611
we would probably kiss in the end.

36:06.931 --> 36:09.182
Carter.

36:09.234 --> 36:12.235
We should talk about this.

36:12.270 --> 36:14.854
Can we please just forget about it?

36:30.338 --> 36:33.122
- Hey. 
- Hey.

36:33.124 --> 36:35.124
You're still up.

36:35.176 --> 36:38.795
Yeah, I waited for you.

36:38.797 --> 36:40.797
Really?

36:45.720 --> 36:47.303
♪ Oh ♪

36:47.305 --> 36:49.689
♪ We will stand ♪

36:49.724 --> 36:53.643
♪ But when will we lay? ♪

36:55.113 --> 36:56.853
What was that for?

36:57.573 --> 36:59.682
That was for today.

37:01.319 --> 37:03.986
I should have supported you more.

37:03.988 --> 37:05.955
Not just attacked Lori.

37:05.990 --> 37:08.124
Oh, Tay, it's fine.

37:08.159 --> 37:09.992
I get it.

37:09.994 --> 37:11.828
You're not exactly a fan.

37:11.880 --> 37:14.580
Doesn't really matter.

37:14.615 --> 37:17.400
What matters is that you needed me,

37:17.469 --> 37:20.887
and I wasn't there.

37:20.922 --> 37:23.172
Taylor, it's fine.

37:23.174 --> 37:25.675
Honestly, I...

37:25.677 --> 37:27.477
I didn't even know how
I was gonna feel myself

37:27.512 --> 37:29.762
until I got there.

37:29.814 --> 37:31.180
It's really okay.

37:31.182 --> 37:33.349
It's not.

37:33.351 --> 37:36.436
It's girl code.

37:36.655 --> 37:39.188
It's that sister code.

37:39.530 --> 37:41.524
And I broke it.

37:49.167 --> 37:50.772
You know I love you, right?

37:53.088 --> 37:54.756
The feeling's kind of mutual.

37:57.592 --> 37:59.217
Do you want some tea?

38:00.428 --> 38:02.795
No, thanks, I'm wiped.

38:02.847 --> 38:05.715
I think I'm just gonna
go upstairs and go to bed.

38:05.767 --> 38:07.383
Okay.

38:08.543 --> 38:09.825
Um...

38:12.107 --> 38:13.909
If you ever need to talk,

38:15.703 --> 38:17.119
you know I'm here.

38:19.731 --> 38:21.143
Thanks.

38:21.733 --> 38:23.232
Good night.

38:23.284 --> 38:25.485
Good night.
