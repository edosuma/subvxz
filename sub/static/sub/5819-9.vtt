Previously on "The Originals"...

00:02.758 --> 00:04.945
If this prophecy
is fulfilled,

00:04.946 --> 00:06.198
you will all fall...

00:06.199 --> 00:08.141
One by friend, one by foe,

00:08.141 --> 00:10.255
and one by family.

00:10.256 --> 00:11.875
- I'll find you.
- You won't.

00:11.876 --> 00:14.147
There are things lurking
in the shadows,

00:14.148 --> 00:16.399
and in the face of these,
you are nothing.

00:16.400 --> 00:17.533
The serratura.

00:17.535 --> 00:19.152
My brother and Lucien
want to use it

00:19.153 --> 00:21.571
to lock you
and your siblings away forever.

00:21.572 --> 00:25.158
Which is why they sent a
legion of Strix to collect my sister.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.160
I decided to put her
someplace safe...

00:27.161 --> 00:28.962
At the bottom of the ocean.

00:28.963 --> 00:30.664
Records show the very night
our sister was taken.

00:30.665 --> 00:32.332
All we need to do
is match the path.

00:32.333 --> 00:35.168
With the latitude
I plucked from Aurora.

00:35.169 --> 00:37.170
You presume to know me?

00:37.171 --> 00:39.089
I will end you for what
you did to Camille.

00:39.090 --> 00:40.507
Tonight, I'd like you
to stay here,

00:40.508 --> 00:42.174
where I can protect you.

00:43.844 --> 00:46.179
Rebekah, voice-over: Marcel
once asked me what it feels like

00:46.180 --> 00:47.814
being daggered.

00:47.815 --> 00:51.901
I told him it's like
a deep, dreamless sleep,

00:51.902 --> 00:55.905
but this is no ordinary dagger.

00:55.906 --> 00:58.441
This stake ensures
I feel everything...

00:58.442 --> 01:00.527
The aching cold,

01:00.528 --> 01:03.329
the suffocating darkness,

01:03.330 --> 01:06.365
the burn of my veins
crying out for blood,

01:06.367 --> 01:09.869
and the long agony of waiting.

01:09.870 --> 01:12.205
Right where he said it would be.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.457
Open it.

01:14.458 --> 01:16.843
This Mr. Elijah Smith

01:16.844 --> 01:20.630
paid big money to have
this dredged out of the gulf.

01:20.631 --> 01:21.848
What's ever in it,

01:21.849 --> 01:23.767
it's got to be worth a fortune.

01:23.768 --> 01:26.218
I say we renegotiate.

01:32.226 --> 01:34.727
I'm afraid that.
Was my final offer.

01:36.897 --> 01:38.281

I compel her to feed me

02:37.124 --> 02:39.342
and to hang the occasional
Christmas ornament.

02:39.343 --> 02:42.512
She can say whatever

02:42.513 --> 02:45.181
You seem better.

02:45.182 --> 02:47.433
Yeah. Thank you
for letting me stay here

02:47.434 --> 02:49.302
for the past couple days

02:49.303 --> 02:52.972

I hope it's not to stay
and baby-sit me.

03:01.198 --> 03:03.483
It's not a good idea
for he and I to spend

03:03.484 --> 03:05.318
hours together
in confined spaces,

03:05.319 --> 03:07.320
given that the prophecy
foretells

03:07.321 --> 03:10.240
one family member
felling another.

You don't think

03:26.340 --> 03:29.746
It's Vincent.
I have to go.

03:36.267 --> 03:37.850
Taking over my bar.

03:37.852 --> 03:39.936
You don't really strike
me as a jazz fan.

03:39.937 --> 03:41.354
You're a Strix now, Marcel.

03:41.355 --> 03:44.357
What's yours is
our and vice versa.

03:44.358 --> 03:45.525
You should be grateful.

03:45.526 --> 03:46.910
You need my help, as I imagine

03:46.911 --> 03:50.279
the Mikaelsons still
want your head.

03:50.281 --> 03:53.366
This venue is brilliant.

03:53.367 --> 03:56.870
A neutral space
where magic is useless.

03:56.871 --> 03:59.422
It should do nicely,
at least until I install

03:59.423 --> 04:01.374
a suitable regent to Shepherd

04:01.375 --> 04:02.842
the local witches.

04:02.843 --> 04:04.210
Well, that might take a while.

04:04.211 --> 04:05.712
See, the last regent was shunned

04:05.713 --> 04:07.380
and the one before
that murdered.

04:07.381 --> 04:10.350
No one's really
eager to step up.

04:10.351 --> 04:12.552
As a member
of this organization,

04:12.553 --> 04:16.973
you should know that we do
not wait for men to step up.

04:16.974 --> 04:19.358
We step them up.

04:19.360 --> 04:22.695
Ok. So we install
an Ally as regent.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.731
Good plan if you
can find a witch

04:24.732 --> 04:26.065
willing to do your bidding.

04:26.066 --> 04:28.151
In fact, I have a candidate...

04:28.152 --> 04:29.736
Young, malleable.

04:29.737 --> 04:30.870
His name is Van Nguyen.

04:30.871 --> 04:33.489
It seems someone
killed his mother.

04:33.490 --> 04:36.542
As it is Christmas and I am,
despite reputation,

04:36.543 --> 04:40.046
a charitable man,
I made an offer.

04:40.047 --> 04:43.582
He'll use his powers
to do as I ask.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.260
You're jumpy.

04:54.261 --> 04:56.179
Maybe that's from being
jumped so many times.

04:56.180 --> 04:57.680
Yeah.

04:57.681 --> 04:59.065
I haven't been out
since everything.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.266
What's up?

05:00.267 --> 05:01.567
I need fed you to
make a house call.

05:01.568 --> 05:03.403
Kinney got fired last week.

05:03.404 --> 05:04.687
- What?
- Yeah.

05:04.688 --> 05:06.489
No, but he... He's a good cop.

05:06.490 --> 05:07.907
Yeah, he was a good cop

05:07.908 --> 05:09.442
until he started
having blackouts,

05:09.443 --> 05:11.244
going Mia when he's
supposed to be on duty.

05:11.245 --> 05:13.780
I mean, there are gaping
holes in his reports,

05:13.781 --> 05:15.281
arrests he can't explain,

05:15.282 --> 05:17.283
missing evidence
he can't explain,

05:17.284 --> 05:19.118
and now he's isolating,
he's not coming out of the house,

05:19.119 --> 05:20.787
he's not taking my phone calls.

05:20.788 --> 05:24.007
I'll go see him.
There has to be something I can say.

05:24.008 --> 05:25.340
Thank you.

05:37.855 --> 05:39.806
I know you needed space, Jack,

05:39.807 --> 05:42.642
but I kind of eventually
thought you would come home.

05:42.643 --> 05:45.528
Right. To the apartment Elijah
compelled somebody to rent us

05:45.529 --> 05:48.530
and the bedroom
that looks in on his library.

05:48.532 --> 05:50.116
- Do you love him?
- Jack.

05:50.117 --> 05:52.485
Just tell me the truth for once.

05:52.486 --> 05:56.489
You knew... You knew
when you married me.

05:56.490 --> 05:57.873
It's been a year.

05:57.875 --> 05:59.959
I have stood by you,
I have fought for you,

05:59.960 --> 06:02.045
I have loved you
and you daughter,

06:02.046 --> 06:05.164
and do you know
what the worst part is?

06:05.165 --> 06:07.000
Coming out of those
woods just now,

06:07.001 --> 06:09.085
seeing you sitting there,

06:09.086 --> 06:12.922
I'll be damned if it wasn't
the best thing I had ever seen.

06:12.923 --> 06:14.340
Even when I'm pissed as hell,

06:14.341 --> 06:16.175
I would rather be near
you than anywhere else.

06:16.176 --> 06:18.678
Now what kind of fool
does that make me?

06:18.679 --> 06:23.982
My feelings for Elijah
are complicated...

06:23.984 --> 06:27.853
But that doesn't mean
that I love you any less, Jack.

06:29.239 --> 06:30.990
I chose you,

06:30.991 --> 06:33.693
and I choose you again
every single day.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.861
Can't that be enough?

06:37.831 --> 06:40.228
It's our first
Christmas together.

06:41.785 --> 06:45.421
I've never had a happy one.

06:45.422 --> 06:48.458
I just want a quiet night
with you and hope,

06:48.459 --> 06:50.543
our family,

06:50.544 --> 06:53.546
and I don't care if
their house is on fire.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.264
For one night,
I will let it burn.

06:55.265 --> 06:59.434
Just please, please come home.

07:02.222 --> 07:03.638
Ok.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.394
I'll meet you there.

07:08.395 --> 07:09.979
Ok.

07:09.980 --> 07:11.396
Go on.

07:30.601 --> 07:32.251
How many days has it been?

07:32.252 --> 07:34.003
Please go relax.

07:34.004 --> 07:36.088
I'll be up shortly
with your next dose.

07:36.090 --> 07:37.306
No, no.

07:37.307 --> 07:39.058
Let's try to avoid
another episode.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.309
No, no.
I will not relax

07:40.310 --> 07:42.228
until Niklaus is buried alive.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.514
We need to get back
the serratura

07:44.515 --> 07:46.849
and lock them all
away in a pit of fire.

07:46.850 --> 07:49.768
It's being taken
care of, darling.

07:49.770 --> 07:52.522
Here. The sister
has been researching

07:52.523 --> 07:54.273
the medallion since it's been

07:54.274 --> 07:55.691
in the Mikaelsons' possession.

07:55.692 --> 07:57.860
By end of day,
we'll have what is ours,

07:57.861 --> 07:59.862
and we'll have taken care
of the only witch

07:59.863 --> 08:01.780
willing to protect them.

08:08.956 --> 08:10.372
Ugh.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.626
I think I prefer
the bottom the murky sea

08:13.627 --> 08:15.761
to that restroom.

08:15.762 --> 08:18.598
Still hungry, are we?

08:18.599 --> 08:20.466
I'm not hungry, I'm angry...

08:20.467 --> 08:22.135
Staked your ex,
drowned by Nik's.

08:22.136 --> 08:23.886
You two need a lesson in women.

08:23.887 --> 08:25.805
Could the lesson not be
yours to learn, Rebekah?

08:25.806 --> 08:27.356
Didn't you damn one
of them to eternity,

08:27.357 --> 08:29.609
viciously antagonize the other?

08:29.610 --> 08:33.196
Those lunatics actually
believe the prophecy.

08:33.197 --> 08:34.397
You don't, do you?

08:34.398 --> 08:35.648
You'd be foolish to ignore

08:35.649 --> 08:37.066
the manifestation
of these omens.

08:37.067 --> 08:38.818
We can't be killed, Elijah.

08:38.818 --> 08:40.870
This prophecy does state one
of us will fall by family.

08:40.871 --> 08:42.320
Well, I would never harm you,

08:42.322 --> 08:44.157
you killed half the Navy
rescuing me,

08:44.158 --> 08:46.292
Freya hates traitors.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.161
Yes. Freya. Let's not forget
her allegiance to Finn.

08:48.162 --> 08:50.329
I do want to trust her, but...

08:50.330 --> 08:53.166
So that leaves Nik.

08:53.167 --> 08:54.500
Do you think he's
learned his lesson

08:54.501 --> 08:56.636
about backstabbing his family?

08:56.637 --> 08:59.422
Oh, I think he learns
that lesson all the time.

08:59.423 --> 09:01.756
He's just a terrible student.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.179
Do you ever want to
just rip out his heart

09:06.180 --> 09:08.847
and see how long
it takes to grow back?

09:10.684 --> 09:13.768
Unh! Ohh.

09:15.272 --> 09:16.938
What is it?

09:16.940 --> 09:18.658
Marvelous.

09:18.659 --> 09:21.360
What do you get the girl
who has everything this Christmas?

09:21.361 --> 09:24.696
A cure to a magical mark
growing on her bloody arm.

10:01.653 --> 10:04.254
I'll warn you...
I'm armed.

10:08.910 --> 10:11.529
Aah! Aah!

10:11.530 --> 10:12.912
Unh!

10:27.129 --> 10:28.545
Unh!

10:30.215 --> 10:31.598
Agh!

11:06.418 --> 11:09.470
Will, you in there?
It's Cami.

11:09.471 --> 11:12.256
I assume you called first.

11:12.257 --> 11:13.424
I've been told turning up

11:13.425 --> 11:14.725
at someone's home uninvited

11:14.726 --> 11:15.760
could be considered rude.

11:15.761 --> 11:17.595
Are you seriously following me?

11:17.596 --> 11:19.263
Klaus, I don't need a bodyguard

11:19.264 --> 11:22.099
or some white night
trying to protect me.

11:22.100 --> 11:24.267
I'm here as your friend.

11:31.026 --> 11:32.276
Vincent said he'd be home.

11:32.277 --> 11:33.854
Shh, shh.

11:40.619 --> 11:42.286
Yah!

11:42.287 --> 11:43.671
Oh, my God! Will! No!

11:43.672 --> 11:45.039
Camille!

11:45.040 --> 11:46.840
You shouldn't
have come here!

11:46.842 --> 11:48.291
Will, it's gonna be ok.

11:48.293 --> 11:49.460
Just drop the gun.

11:49.461 --> 11:51.595
Insert empathetic
psychobabble here.

11:51.596 --> 11:52.630
It's not ok!

11:52.631 --> 11:53.963
Put the gun down!

11:53.965 --> 11:56.183
Or what, you'll
save me the bullet?

11:56.184 --> 11:58.602
I am the definition
of worthless!

11:58.603 --> 12:01.722
I try and try to
make a difference,

12:01.723 --> 12:05.643
but there are things lurking
out there in the shadows,

12:05.644 --> 12:07.528
and... And in the face of them,
I am nothing.

12:07.529 --> 12:10.064
Do you understand?

12:10.065 --> 12:12.149
It's Lucien's compulsion.

12:12.150 --> 12:15.201
Is there anything
you can do, Klaus? Please.

12:17.205 --> 12:18.988
Invite me in.

12:23.044 --> 12:25.329
Hey! I got your text.

12:25.330 --> 12:26.330
What happened?

12:26.331 --> 12:27.630
She got jumped.

12:27.632 --> 12:29.750
3 vampires all dressed
like yuppies.

12:29.751 --> 12:30.835
The Strix.

12:30.836 --> 12:32.502
Yeah. She needs your blood.

12:35.551 --> 12:37.341
You ok?

12:37.342 --> 12:38.726
Kind of hard to
ignore it when someone

12:38.727 --> 12:40.260
needs your help, huh?

12:42.898 --> 12:44.515
They took it.

12:44.516 --> 12:46.734
The serratura.

12:46.735 --> 12:48.568
I was meeting with a witch

12:48.570 --> 12:50.020
from the bloodline
who built the lock.

12:50.021 --> 12:51.772
I was hoping she could
help me destroy it,

12:51.773 --> 12:53.574
but it's not possible.

12:53.575 --> 12:55.693
She said the only way
to get rid of it

12:55.694 --> 12:57.161
is to use it.

12:57.162 --> 12:59.446
We have to get it back
and lock something else away,

12:59.447 --> 13:01.665
anything but my family.

13:01.666 --> 13:03.367
Great. Why don't
we pay Tristan a visit

13:03.368 --> 13:06.202
and ask him
really, really nicely?

13:08.673 --> 13:12.009
I'm afraid we have
a far more urgent problem.

13:12.010 --> 13:14.011
Well, to be fair,
I am the prettiest

13:14.012 --> 13:16.212
urgent problem
you have ever seen.

13:19.684 --> 13:22.552
I opened
this gym for warriors.

13:23.766 --> 13:25.272
You're not welcome anymore.

13:25.273 --> 13:26.891
Excuse me.

13:26.892 --> 13:29.225
Van Nguyen, the kid whose
mom went after Davina...

13:29.227 --> 13:31.362
Family business got shut down.

13:31.363 --> 13:33.730
He can't put food on
the table for his sisters.

13:33.732 --> 13:36.283
Life's a bitch in the ninth.
What else is new?

13:36.284 --> 13:39.069
Today, Tristan transferred
50 gs into Van's account.

13:39.070 --> 13:42.907
Tonight, Van will ascend
to the regency.

13:42.908 --> 13:45.576
The leader of
the witches will be some kid

13:45.577 --> 13:48.629
with a debt to The Strix.

13:48.630 --> 13:50.748
Meanwhile, you're here,

13:50.749 --> 13:51.999
fighting shadows.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.334
Marcel, you got no idea
what I fight.

13:58.757 --> 14:01.475
Wow.

14:01.476 --> 14:03.093
Whatever it is,
it's gonna be a lot worse

14:03.094 --> 14:05.145
when you have the blood
of your people on your hands,

14:05.146 --> 14:07.765
all because you sat back
and let it happen.

14:07.766 --> 14:09.934
Since when have you given
a damn about my people?

14:09.935 --> 14:11.769
I'm New Orleans born and bred.

14:11.770 --> 14:13.320
So are you.

14:13.321 --> 14:14.605
Yeah, witches and vampires

14:14.606 --> 14:15.773
have been fighting for power

14:15.774 --> 14:16.941
since this city was a swamp,

14:16.942 --> 14:18.859
but we are all New Orleans,

14:18.860 --> 14:21.779
and now you're gonna hand
over 9 powerful covens

14:21.780 --> 14:23.914
to some outsider!

14:23.915 --> 14:24.949
Witch business ain't
your business.

14:24.950 --> 14:26.617
I think you should back off.

14:26.618 --> 14:29.370
Or what? You gonna get
another little teenage girl

14:29.371 --> 14:31.371
to do your dirty work?

14:41.299 --> 14:43.767
Hoo.

14:43.768 --> 14:48.138
I have been holding back
my power for a long time.

14:48.139 --> 14:49.974
Today that stops.

14:49.975 --> 14:51.642
See, I came here for
a little bit of clarity,

14:51.643 --> 14:53.477
and I think I just got that.

14:53.478 --> 14:55.980
I'm gonna take back
the regency, Marcel,

14:55.981 --> 14:58.731
but you ain't gonna like
what I'm gonna do with it.

15:10.495 --> 15:12.880
While I cannot take away
the feelings of worthlessness

15:12.881 --> 15:14.832
that haunt you now,
I can tell you

15:14.833 --> 15:17.835
you will learn
to live with them.

15:17.836 --> 15:19.837
I certainly have.

15:19.838 --> 15:21.922
I have also come to find

15:21.923 --> 15:25.059
that the very thing you
believe is worth the least

15:25.060 --> 15:27.478
matters most of all.

15:27.479 --> 15:30.731
There is beauty in the courage

15:30.732 --> 15:34.068
of the fragile fighter,

15:34.069 --> 15:36.520
those who persevere

15:36.521 --> 15:38.822
despite all they've
been through,

15:38.823 --> 15:43.026
those who still believe
there is good in the world.

15:47.532 --> 15:49.533
Us dark things
often find we need

15:49.534 --> 15:51.534
that light the most.

15:54.255 --> 15:57.091
What you do not see in yourself

15:57.092 --> 15:58.959
others see in you.

15:58.960 --> 16:02.462
You do matter.

16:10.438 --> 16:13.273
Have you a family?

16:13.274 --> 16:16.026
Yeah, a sister.
Baton Rouge.

16:16.027 --> 16:19.062
Go to her.
Enjoy Christmas.

16:19.064 --> 16:22.066
In the new year,
you will return to your captain,

16:22.067 --> 16:25.736
and he will welcome
you with open arms,

16:25.737 --> 16:28.539
and, detective,

16:28.540 --> 16:33.911
you will remember today
as your darkest day.

16:33.912 --> 16:38.132
Tomorrow will be better,

16:38.133 --> 16:40.452
the day after better still.

16:42.670 --> 16:44.420
You will go on.

16:52.180 --> 16:55.182
Give me the bad news, doc.

16:55.183 --> 16:56.650
Aya's stake was cursed.

16:56.651 --> 16:58.102
It infected you.

16:58.103 --> 17:01.739
As this mark grows,
you will go mad.

17:01.740 --> 17:03.774
Left unchecked, you will become

17:03.775 --> 17:06.993
a relentless,
unstoppable ripper.

17:06.994 --> 17:08.945
Aya always was thorough.

17:08.946 --> 17:10.446
Strix always employ a safeguard.

17:10.448 --> 17:12.582
In the event
that we were successful

17:12.584 --> 17:14.167
at retrieving your body,
you were cursed.

17:14.169 --> 17:16.619
You see, if one is on a rampage,

17:16.621 --> 17:17.954
one is not difficult to hunt.

17:17.955 --> 17:20.624
Can you fix this?

17:20.625 --> 17:22.291
The spell is carved here.

17:22.292 --> 17:25.212
I can... I can reverse it.

17:25.213 --> 17:28.464
I just... Need some time

17:28.465 --> 17:31.134
and a hell of a lot of magic.

17:38.143 --> 17:41.144
She was fine.
Hayley healed her.

17:43.782 --> 17:45.816
This scratch is not healed.

17:45.817 --> 17:48.202
This is poison.

17:48.203 --> 17:51.649
This is an assassination
attempt.

18:00.307 --> 18:01.640
She's waking up.

18:03.811 --> 18:05.394
You ok?

18:05.395 --> 18:07.897
I feel weak.

18:07.898 --> 18:12.235
Those vampires must
have stabbed her with something.

18:12.236 --> 18:14.370
So The Strix are fond of
this slow-acting poison.

18:14.371 --> 18:16.205
There is an antidote.

18:16.206 --> 18:17.989
If I can get my hands on it.

18:20.043 --> 18:23.162
For this, I'll need
a pure silver knife,

18:23.163 --> 18:25.248
some white muskroot.

18:25.249 --> 18:26.332
I'll get the knife.

18:26.333 --> 18:28.334
I'll track down the root.

18:28.335 --> 18:30.303
Freya, you can barely
float a feather right now,

18:30.304 --> 18:32.505
let alone save the world.

18:32.506 --> 18:33.756
I'll channel Finn.

18:33.757 --> 18:36.008
Oh, lovely.

18:36.009 --> 18:37.059
My fate rests in the hands

18:37.060 --> 18:38.177
of our black sheep of a brother

18:38.178 --> 18:40.179
that we have trapped
in a necklace.

18:40.180 --> 18:41.681
I'm sure he's just
leaping to help.

18:41.682 --> 18:44.350
Well, he's the only other
powerful witch here,

18:44.351 --> 18:47.602
and you and I are out of options,
sister.

18:56.139 --> 18:57.864
He's packing.

18:57.865 --> 18:59.582
Klaus...

18:59.583 --> 19:00.582
What you did...

19:00.584 --> 19:02.869
Was nothing.

19:02.870 --> 19:06.455
It was not nothing.

19:14.715 --> 19:16.442
Elijah.

19:28.896 --> 19:31.314
The pain you
endure for these monsters

19:31.315 --> 19:32.648
you call family.

19:32.649 --> 19:34.233
Finn.

19:34.234 --> 19:36.702
It isn't worth it, sister.

19:36.703 --> 19:40.406
It is.
It has to be.

19:40.407 --> 19:42.742
The ingredients are complicated.

19:42.743 --> 19:44.076
I don't need the recipe.

19:44.077 --> 19:45.628
I know exactly where I
can find the antidote.

19:45.629 --> 19:48.080
I'll be quick.

19:48.081 --> 19:50.582
If The Strix have been using
this poison for centuries,

19:50.584 --> 19:52.418
then Lucien has a cure,
I guarantee it.

19:52.419 --> 19:53.753
Probably keeps it tucked away

19:53.754 --> 19:55.587
next to his cure
for werewolf bites.

19:55.589 --> 19:57.924
I'm sure he won't mind if
we break in and borrow it.

19:57.925 --> 20:01.677
You go.
I'll be fine.

20:01.678 --> 20:03.479
No.

20:03.480 --> 20:04.764
If I'm going to save my sisters,

20:04.765 --> 20:07.767
I can't be worried about you.

20:07.768 --> 20:11.938
Right now,
the safest place for you is with me.

20:11.939 --> 20:13.271
Please.

20:19.780 --> 20:22.782
Don't fret.
I haven't gone full hellion yet.

20:22.783 --> 20:24.282
No more than usual.

20:24.284 --> 20:25.751
Well, that's good.
I wouldn't want to

20:25.752 --> 20:28.838
have to kick your ass
before I got to hug you.

20:28.839 --> 20:31.123
You know, we need to talk
about your sartorial choices.

20:31.124 --> 20:33.376
This is positively darling.

20:33.377 --> 20:35.795
That is not mine.
That is Cami's.

20:35.796 --> 20:37.964
She has been staying
here the past few nights.

20:37.965 --> 20:41.634
Actually, Jackson and I
have our own place now,

20:41.635 --> 20:46.138
although we still can't manage
to stay out of Mikaelson drama.

20:46.139 --> 20:47.807
You don't seem to mind
the family drama

20:47.808 --> 20:49.692
when you need something from us,

20:49.693 --> 20:53.311
like a decent dress
or a babysitter.

20:53.313 --> 20:54.814
Excuse me?

20:54.815 --> 20:56.399
But when you're looking
for someone to blame

20:56.400 --> 20:57.650
for your unhappiness,

20:57.651 --> 21:00.903
we seem to be the enemy.

21:00.904 --> 21:03.906
Rebekah, you're wrong.

21:03.907 --> 21:05.574
This... This isn't you.

21:05.575 --> 21:07.376
I am wrong.

21:07.377 --> 21:09.829
I believed we were friends,

21:09.830 --> 21:11.330
nearly sisters,

21:11.331 --> 21:12.665
but the last time we spoke,

21:12.666 --> 21:14.000
you were planning
on taking hope away

21:14.001 --> 21:15.167
from this family forever,

21:15.168 --> 21:17.720
so where do you stand, Hayley?

21:17.721 --> 21:20.389
Are you a friend,

21:20.390 --> 21:23.426
are you family,

21:23.427 --> 21:26.012
or perhaps...

21:27.597 --> 21:29.565
You've been a foe all along.

21:39.986 --> 21:42.103
You are dying for her.

21:42.104 --> 21:43.905
Let Rebekah go.

21:43.906 --> 21:45.357
Let them all go.

21:45.358 --> 21:46.525
Uh-uh.

21:46.526 --> 21:47.776
It will just be
the two of us again.

21:47.777 --> 21:49.594
I will save her.

21:49.595 --> 21:53.532
If I am at all important
to you, brother, help me.

21:53.533 --> 21:56.500
Freya, stop, please!

21:56.502 --> 21:57.535
No! Don't touch me!

21:57.537 --> 21:59.788
Do not stop me.

21:59.789 --> 22:01.406
Listen to me.

22:01.407 --> 22:02.707
We must help Rebekah,

22:02.708 --> 22:04.209
but we must not lose
you in the process.

22:04.210 --> 22:06.378
Help me or get out!

22:13.936 --> 22:15.387
This will strengthen you.

22:15.388 --> 22:16.888
As will my power

22:16.889 --> 22:20.058
just this once, sister, for you.

22:24.947 --> 22:28.232
Be honest. You want
Klaus dead, don't you?

22:29.952 --> 22:32.070
Rebekah, I have been
busting my ass,

22:32.071 --> 22:34.039
trying to fight this prophecy

22:34.040 --> 22:35.907
at the expense of my own family.

22:35.908 --> 22:38.410
Ha ha! You mean
that fake husband

22:38.411 --> 22:41.412
you've been parading
around in front of Elijah?

22:41.414 --> 22:45.800
Do you know the agony
it causes him?

22:45.801 --> 22:47.385
Perhaps you like it,

22:47.386 --> 22:50.421
knowing you still have
the power to break his heart.

22:57.313 --> 22:59.097
Ugh! I can't do it.

22:59.098 --> 23:02.017
I can't focus.

23:02.018 --> 23:05.320
She's burning up. I guess
a hospital's out of the question.

23:05.321 --> 23:06.855
A hospital won't help her.

23:06.856 --> 23:08.439
You're wrong.

23:08.441 --> 23:10.942
It kills me to hurt him.

23:10.943 --> 23:12.611
Well, it hasn't yet, luv,

23:12.612 --> 23:14.829
but it might today.

23:14.830 --> 23:16.781
You tore my brothers apart.

23:16.782 --> 23:19.918
If they turn on each other,
as the prophecy suggests,

23:19.919 --> 23:21.619
it's because of you!

23:27.126 --> 23:28.677
Where's Hayley?

23:31.764 --> 23:34.014
You stay with her, please.

23:36.969 --> 23:38.385
Raah!

23:44.135 --> 23:46.027
Listen to me.
Listen to me!

23:46.028 --> 23:49.063
Rebekah, look at me!
Rebekah!

23:50.850 --> 23:52.399
Control yourself.

24:01.627 --> 24:04.662
Dear brother, I have control.

24:06.716 --> 24:09.166
Good.

24:10.836 --> 24:12.921
Ha! Yaah!

24:12.922 --> 24:15.423
Unh! Aah!

24:15.424 --> 24:16.675
Rebekah!

24:19.178 --> 24:20.728
Not her.

24:25.101 --> 24:26.735
Not her either!

24:26.736 --> 24:28.102
Aah!

24:31.907 --> 24:34.526
Dear, sweet Cami.

24:34.527 --> 24:37.162
You're so afraid
that you'll ruin her,

24:37.163 --> 24:38.697
you keep her behind glass

24:38.698 --> 24:41.199
like some breakable object.

24:41.200 --> 24:42.533
She's not precious.

24:42.535 --> 24:44.419
Nik, every woman
that you and Elijah

24:44.420 --> 24:46.254
bring into our lives
turns to poison.

24:48.340 --> 24:50.425
She'll grow toxic, too.

24:50.426 --> 24:51.709
Hyah!

24:54.847 --> 24:55.880
I'm ok.

24:55.881 --> 24:57.264
In her heart.

25:09.395 --> 25:10.729
Did you get the muskroot?

25:10.730 --> 25:11.945
Yeah.

25:32.134 --> 25:34.586
No! No! Aah!

25:34.587 --> 25:36.253
Hold her!

26:09.789 --> 26:11.898
Well, that was annoying.

26:26.008 --> 26:27.342
You ready to go?

26:27.343 --> 26:28.844
Am I the world's worst mother

26:28.845 --> 26:31.396
for letting
my teething toddler gnaw

26:31.397 --> 26:34.349
on something that's been
around for a millennium?

26:34.350 --> 26:36.401
Hope's tough.
I think she can take it.

26:36.402 --> 26:38.153
Are you ok?

26:38.154 --> 26:39.688
Oh, you never get used
to the feeling

26:39.689 --> 26:42.908
of a fist around your heart.

26:42.909 --> 26:44.526
I'm really sorry.

26:44.527 --> 26:47.329
I know I promised
that we'd spend the night alone.

26:47.330 --> 26:49.865
I even had this really dumb plan

26:49.866 --> 26:51.416
that we were gonna
drink hot whiskeys

26:51.417 --> 26:53.702
and watch "it's
a wonderful life" together,

26:53.703 --> 26:55.619
yet here we are.

26:55.621 --> 26:57.422
You don't need to apologize.

26:57.423 --> 26:59.841
Today, it was me

26:59.842 --> 27:01.543
that saw their house
on fire and decided

27:01.544 --> 27:04.179
not to let it burn.

27:04.180 --> 27:06.097
Why did you decide to help them

27:06.098 --> 27:07.932
after everything?

27:11.387 --> 27:13.889
Instinct.

27:13.890 --> 27:15.106
I don't know.
I felt like one of my pack

27:15.107 --> 27:17.225
was in danger, and I acted.

27:17.226 --> 27:18.894
I mean, don't get me wrong.

27:18.895 --> 27:22.230
My in-laws really suck...

27:22.231 --> 27:26.451
But, hey, they fought like hell
to protect each other today,

27:26.452 --> 27:30.205
and I respect that.

27:30.206 --> 27:33.909
I was born to love you, Hayley,

27:33.910 --> 27:36.077
and if that means I have to
deal with the Mikaelsons,

27:36.078 --> 27:39.164
then ok.

27:39.165 --> 27:40.581
I'm in.

27:47.473 --> 27:49.424
If we leave now,
we could still catch

27:49.425 --> 27:52.928
the end of "it's a wonderful
life" before her bedtime.

27:52.929 --> 27:54.763
I got a better idea.

27:56.599 --> 27:59.934

out of Mason jar moonshine.

28:35.638 --> 28:37.188
Ha ha ha!

28:37.189 --> 28:40.191
Well, Nik, you
are positively merry tonight.

28:40.192 --> 28:43.311
All that therapy
must be paying off.

28:43.312 --> 28:45.313
Oh, no.

28:45.314 --> 28:48.066
Yes, I know it's not
exactly a bonfire,

28:48.067 --> 28:49.484
but I improvised.

28:49.485 --> 28:51.236
Come on. It's tradition.

28:51.237 --> 28:52.654
Tradition?

28:52.655 --> 28:54.990
We write our wishes
and then burn them for luck.

28:54.991 --> 28:57.993
Strangely, I don't recall
wishing for an influx of enemies,

28:57.994 --> 28:59.661
and yet year after year...

28:59.662 --> 29:02.080

29:16.512 --> 29:20.148
Right now,
what concerns me is our enemies.

29:20.149 --> 29:24.152
They have the weapon
they intend to use against us.

29:24.153 --> 29:28.189
They cannot know that we found you,
Rebekah.

29:28.190 --> 29:32.026
Our best advantage is if
they believe you are lost at sea.

29:34.277 --> 29:36.413
Then I can't stay, can I?

29:51.797 --> 29:53.548
It's ok.

29:53.549 --> 29:55.717
My wish already came true.

29:55.718 --> 29:57.551
We have this moment.

30:22.078 --> 30:24.245
Rather lonely place
to spend a holiday.

30:24.246 --> 30:28.249
Have you no special
love to spend it with?

30:28.250 --> 30:30.085
Oh. Right.

30:30.086 --> 30:31.803
Don't tell me.

30:31.804 --> 30:33.254
You planning on taking over
the gym, too?

30:33.255 --> 30:35.924
Hardly. I can't stand churches.

30:35.925 --> 30:38.593
I need your expertise, Marcel.

30:38.594 --> 30:40.895
I've been informed
that our chosen regent,

30:40.896 --> 30:42.313
the young Van Nguyen,

30:42.314 --> 30:44.232
has been rejected
by the ancestors.

30:44.233 --> 30:46.568
Rejected, huh?
Well, Nola witches

30:46.569 --> 30:48.603
aren't easily manipulated,

30:48.604 --> 30:50.772
especially the dead ones.

30:50.773 --> 30:53.324
And yet there's a rather
dramatic ceremony happening

30:53.325 --> 30:55.410
in the cemetery right now.

30:55.411 --> 30:59.447
Someone is ascending to
the regency as we speak.

30:59.448 --> 31:02.117
I assume you've had
your ear to the ground.

31:02.118 --> 31:03.451
Who is it?

31:03.452 --> 31:05.086
Uh, his name's Vincent Griffith.

31:05.087 --> 31:09.623
Ah. The witch who was once
inhabited by Finn Mikaelson.

31:09.625 --> 31:14.929
Yeah, that's him, and he isn't
gonna be so easily bought.

31:14.930 --> 31:17.514

31:44.994 --> 31:46.994
God knows they need it.

31:52.501 --> 31:54.084
Bye, baby.

31:58.841 --> 32:01.509
I'm so sorry about
what I said, Hayley.

32:01.510 --> 32:03.060
It's fine.

32:04.730 --> 32:07.232
You know, when I left last,

32:07.233 --> 32:10.017
I thought for sure
you'd hate Klaus forever.

32:12.188 --> 32:16.690
Oh, I will, but even
when you hate him...

32:22.581 --> 32:24.532
You're always leaving.

32:24.533 --> 32:26.450
And I always come back.

32:34.376 --> 32:38.680
Run far and fast,
stay on the move,

32:38.681 --> 32:42.050
and should you happen to
meet some handsome fool,

32:42.051 --> 32:44.219
know your weaknesses.

32:44.220 --> 32:45.970
Ha ha!

32:45.971 --> 32:49.357
Well, perhaps it's time
our roles reversed.

32:49.358 --> 32:51.109
I'll run away from love

32:51.110 --> 32:52.943
if you run toward it.

33:17.067 --> 33:19.235
100 years
ago, I snuck into

33:19.236 --> 33:23.205
a Christmas ball here.

33:23.206 --> 33:27.209
I wanted so much
to be a part of it,

33:27.210 --> 33:31.247
but I thought I was forever
fated to be an outsider,

33:31.248 --> 33:33.581
always looking in.

33:33.583 --> 33:36.835
I know this hasn't been
your most elegant family Christmas,

33:36.836 --> 33:43.092
but, well, it's already been
the best one I've ever had.

33:43.093 --> 33:45.927
I suppose some things
are worth the wait.

33:57.024 --> 33:58.240
You look...

33:58.241 --> 34:00.826
Don't say tired.

34:00.827 --> 34:02.444
You've lived long enough
to know you should never tell

34:02.445 --> 34:04.330
a woman she looks tired.

34:04.331 --> 34:06.282
I was going to say
contemplative.

34:06.283 --> 34:07.699
Ha.

34:11.288 --> 34:13.170
A penny for your thoughts.

34:16.626 --> 34:19.678
I was thinking about you

34:19.679 --> 34:22.514
and what Rebekah said.

34:22.514 --> 34:24.967
Is she right?
Do you see me

34:24.967 --> 34:28.687
as this fragile thing
that needs to be kept behind glass

34:28.688 --> 34:30.188
to protect me from Aurora...

34:30.190 --> 34:32.974
Don't. Please.

34:32.976 --> 34:35.476
When I think of all the ways
she could have hurt you...

34:35.478 --> 34:36.695
She didn't.

34:36.696 --> 34:39.480
Klaus, she didn't...

34:41.034 --> 34:42.734
Because of you.

34:44.654 --> 34:45.904
I've lost count
of the amount of times

34:45.905 --> 34:47.822
you've been there for me

34:47.824 --> 34:52.043
and everyone you care about,

34:52.045 --> 34:53.879
but today, you saved someone

34:53.880 --> 34:55.164
who doesn't mean a thing to you.

34:55.165 --> 34:56.831
Why?

34:59.302 --> 35:02.304
Because you wished it.

35:02.305 --> 35:03.722
Because what's important to you

35:03.723 --> 35:05.341
is important to me.

35:05.342 --> 35:09.345
What makes you happy makes
me want to keep you so.

35:09.346 --> 35:12.347
What scares you
I want to tear apart.

35:15.268 --> 35:19.570
I do not wish to watch you
from behind glass, Camille.

35:23.860 --> 35:25.610
What do you wish?

35:46.357 --> 35:47.965
Heh.

36:05.318 --> 36:08.953
No. No, no! Finn!

36:08.955 --> 36:12.408
All right. Y'all wanted me.
You got me.

36:12.409 --> 36:13.959
You got me,
and I ain't in the mood

36:13.960 --> 36:15.911
for pomp and circumstance.

36:15.912 --> 36:18.497
Our city is collapsing,

36:18.498 --> 36:22.917
and I'm gonna need all
the guidance I can get.

36:25.422 --> 36:28.257
Congratulations,
Mr. Griffith.

36:28.258 --> 36:32.094
The regent witch
of New Orleans...

36:32.095 --> 36:34.096
How grand.

36:34.097 --> 36:36.014
Let me guess...

36:36.015 --> 36:39.435
Lord Tristan de Martel.

36:39.436 --> 36:42.688
You know, I've always
despised churches,

36:42.689 --> 36:45.107
but cemeteries I love.

36:45.108 --> 36:48.327
Churches celebrate fairy tales,

36:48.328 --> 36:51.246
guardian angels, patron saints,

36:51.247 --> 36:53.699
but cemeteries hold
concrete proof

36:53.700 --> 36:57.669
that not one of those things can
save you from the inevitable.

36:57.670 --> 37:00.706
Yeah.

37:00.707 --> 37:03.292
So your Strix vampires,
they've been watching me,

37:03.293 --> 37:05.210
tailing me, listening to me,

37:05.211 --> 37:08.297
so they know I'm not
an easy target,

37:08.298 --> 37:10.015
and I'm sick and tired
of good people

37:10.016 --> 37:11.967
falling victim to the trash

37:11.968 --> 37:14.970
that The Originals
bring to town.

37:14.971 --> 37:17.856
Now normal people can't
enforce justice on vampires,

37:17.857 --> 37:19.024
but I will.

37:19.025 --> 37:21.309
I can, and I will,

37:21.311 --> 37:23.479
so...

37:23.480 --> 37:26.648
You guys keep watching me,

37:26.649 --> 37:29.651
but know for sure

37:29.652 --> 37:31.369
I'm watching you, too.

37:32.872 --> 37:34.823
That's very brave.

37:34.824 --> 37:37.158
A vigilante witch
that fears no vampire?

37:37.160 --> 37:38.744
Yeah.

37:38.745 --> 37:40.496
Or so it seems,

37:40.497 --> 37:42.880
but I know someone you do fear.

37:46.252 --> 37:49.220
So if you don't do as I ask,

37:49.222 --> 37:51.507
I'm certain Finn Mikaelson will.
