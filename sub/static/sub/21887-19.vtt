00:00.984 --> 00:02.171
<i>Previously on "Gotham"...</i>

00:02.242 --> 00:05.091
I have walked this earth for centuries.

00:05.164 --> 00:06.418
Only you can kill me.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.520
And only with that dagger.

00:12.659 --> 00:14.103
- What did I say?
- Wait!

00:14.181 --> 00:15.794
I can help you get Tabitha back.

00:15.854 --> 00:17.086
Professor Hugo Strange

00:17.189 --> 00:18.555
is the one man who can cure you.

00:18.657 --> 00:19.856
Join me,

00:19.958 --> 00:21.291
and we will find him.

00:21.393 --> 00:23.226
Okay.

00:23.328 --> 00:24.460
But you better deliver.

00:24.563 --> 00:27.263
- Why would I help you?
- You love me.

00:27.365 --> 00:30.466
You've loved me all along.

00:30.569 --> 00:33.800
What's your record for how many
banks you've robbed in one day?

00:33.878 --> 00:36.272
You're playing a dangerous game, Lee.

00:36.374 --> 00:39.372
Ra's al Ghul chose you
to pass on his spirit.

00:39.466 --> 00:41.544
We have much more to show you.

00:41.646 --> 00:42.946
All my life,

00:43.048 --> 00:45.615
I have known that I was meant for more.

00:45.717 --> 00:46.883
This isn't you.

00:46.985 --> 00:49.554
I'm not gonna let
your jealousy distract me.

00:49.615 --> 00:53.217
Ladies, escort Miss Galavan
to the street.

00:53.279 --> 00:55.029
We serve the one and only true master,

00:55.115 --> 00:56.092
Ra's al Ghul.

00:56.194 --> 00:58.394
- But he's dead.
- Death is only an illusion.

01:24.260 --> 01:25.693
What the hell?!

01:25.790 --> 01:28.791
- You didn't sense our approach?
- Uh, no, you're ninjas.

01:28.893 --> 01:30.226
The Demon's Head gives its bearer power

01:30.328 --> 01:32.395
to see past, present, future as one.

01:32.497 --> 01:34.330
You should have anticipated our attack.

01:34.432 --> 01:35.765
So this was a test?

01:36.668 --> 01:38.668
I'm the Demon's Head.

01:38.770 --> 01:40.567
My hand is a freaking lightbulb.

01:40.637 --> 01:41.871
That is only its mark.

01:41.973 --> 01:44.373
You have yet to access its real powers.

01:44.475 --> 01:46.809
You're questioning whether I'm worthy?

01:46.911 --> 01:48.644
I am sick of this.

01:48.746 --> 01:50.546
The men from the League, Tabitha,

01:50.648 --> 01:52.748
- and now you?
- You misunderstand.

01:52.850 --> 01:54.684
How do you think Ra's al Ghul became

01:54.786 --> 01:57.720
the world's most fearsome
warrior and ruled empires?

01:57.822 --> 02:00.723
He saw the future.

02:01.442 --> 02:04.427
So attacking me was, what,
a way to jump-start it?

02:04.529 --> 02:06.162
Like, "Hey, Demon's Head, snap to it"?

02:06.264 --> 02:08.396
The powers of the Demon's Head
are triggered

02:08.499 --> 02:10.199
by intense emotions.

02:10.300 --> 02:11.834
All right.

02:11.936 --> 02:14.170
So next time, don't go so easy on me.

02:15.340 --> 02:17.940
And take that knife out of my face.

02:35.793 --> 02:39.481
You don't have a covert mode
on this thing?

02:56.347 --> 02:58.447
Show-off.

02:58.549 --> 03:00.496
So, you gonna tell me
what Tabitha needs us for?

03:00.593 --> 03:04.855
All I know is it's about
Barbara, and it's important.

03:15.233 --> 03:16.532
So, what's the emergency?

03:16.634 --> 03:17.533
Inside.

03:20.037 --> 03:21.303
You coming?

03:45.730 --> 03:47.830
Tabitha, what am I doing here?

03:50.635 --> 03:52.134
- What the heck?
- Wait.

03:52.236 --> 03:53.602
What the hell? What is this?

03:53.684 --> 03:55.020
I don't know. She didn't
tell me this part.

03:55.082 --> 03:56.639
Barbara needs our help.

03:56.741 --> 03:58.107
She's gonna get herself killed.
She has this thing

03:58.209 --> 03:59.241
called the Demon's Head.

04:01.443 --> 04:03.112
This is about Ra's al Ghul?

04:03.214 --> 04:04.713
He's the one who gave it to her.
These guys are gonna

04:04.816 --> 04:05.881
help us take it back.

04:05.983 --> 04:08.350
Okay, so why do you need Bruce?

04:15.913 --> 04:17.480
You're gonna bring him back.

04:18.067 --> 04:20.135
You, you can't do this.

04:20.213 --> 04:21.863
Ra's wanted to die.

04:21.966 --> 04:23.399
He wanted me to kill him!

04:26.814 --> 04:28.564
And now we need him alive.

04:28.632 --> 04:30.606
No. No! No!

04:35.079 --> 04:36.278
No!

04:36.948 --> 04:37.947
No!

04:41.519 --> 04:43.919
Bone, flesh, breath,

04:44.021 --> 04:45.321
come back to us, our leader.

04:45.423 --> 04:47.640
Now we close the circle.

04:47.719 --> 04:50.085
We give you the blood
of the one who slew you.

04:59.871 --> 05:01.237
No.

05:01.339 --> 05:04.386
You have no idea what you've done...

05:31.302 --> 05:33.224
Five banks in one night?

05:33.294 --> 05:34.326
You're joking.

05:34.388 --> 05:35.787
I wish. These guys were slick.

05:35.888 --> 05:37.606
Banks didn't even know they
were hit till they opened.

05:37.708 --> 05:39.108
One of the banks,
the thieves came in on boats

05:39.210 --> 05:40.209
through the sewer.

05:40.311 --> 05:41.646
Tunneled up into the vaults.

05:41.740 --> 05:43.427
All branches of Gotham Savings and Loan.

05:43.537 --> 05:44.539
Why the same bank?

05:44.649 --> 05:45.915
Maybe a leak in security?

05:46.017 --> 05:47.283
Maybe a grudge.

05:47.385 --> 05:48.817
Five banks in one night's...

05:48.920 --> 05:50.653
it's like someone was
trying to make a point.

05:50.755 --> 05:52.321
Prove how smart he is.

05:52.423 --> 05:54.757
- Ed Nygma?
- If the bowler fits.

05:54.859 --> 05:56.659
Should I put out a BOLO out on him?

05:56.761 --> 05:59.595
Sure. In the meantime, there's
someone else I can talk to.

05:59.697 --> 06:01.640
Say hey to Lee for me, won't you?

06:01.741 --> 06:03.666
Tell her nice shooting with Sofia.

06:06.337 --> 06:07.859
What, I can't make a joke?

06:07.952 --> 06:09.171
That's what that was?

06:09.914 --> 06:12.515
Why don't you go put that BOLO out, huh?

06:24.754 --> 06:26.253
Look at them.

06:26.828 --> 06:28.756
We did good.

06:28.872 --> 06:30.471
Oh, yeah. My brilliance allowed us

06:30.560 --> 06:32.426
to rob five banks in one night,

06:32.762 --> 06:34.495
and now these fine folks in the Narrows

06:34.571 --> 06:36.664
are gonna be drowning in booze
and smokes for years to come.

06:36.766 --> 06:38.761
It's so inspiring.

06:38.854 --> 06:39.940
They're also gonna use the money

06:40.026 --> 06:43.504
to buy food and clothing and medicine.

06:44.774 --> 06:46.407
What's wrong?

06:49.011 --> 06:51.045
What am I to you?

06:53.502 --> 06:54.601
A friend.

06:54.663 --> 06:55.745
A partner.

06:55.820 --> 06:58.524
Are you always this amorous
with your friends?

06:58.621 --> 06:59.953
I mean, I know
that only happened once...

07:00.016 --> 07:01.690
- Ed.
- Don't call me Ed.

07:01.792 --> 07:03.158
Hey.

07:03.260 --> 07:04.793
I care about you.

07:04.895 --> 07:06.795
I depend on you.

07:06.897 --> 07:09.632
You know what we've got planned.

07:09.734 --> 07:13.001
Other things are just gonna
have to wait.

07:13.095 --> 07:15.137
You're not stringing me along,
are you, Lee?

07:15.408 --> 07:17.676
Don't you want to find out

07:18.242 --> 07:20.976
the answer to the riddle?

07:23.814 --> 07:26.043
Maybe I do.

07:26.484 --> 07:28.584
Are we good for tomorrow night?

07:28.686 --> 07:30.586
Yeah, we just have a few last details.

07:30.688 --> 07:34.501
And trust me, this is
going to be a work of art.

07:34.603 --> 07:37.259
That sounds promising.

07:37.361 --> 07:39.273
Oh, what the hell?

07:39.351 --> 07:40.963
Count us in.

07:49.031 --> 07:50.527
You could have told me.

07:50.598 --> 07:51.697
You wouldn't have brought him.

07:51.773 --> 07:52.941
Yeah, because he's my friend.

07:53.044 --> 07:54.943
And what is Barbara? What am I?

07:55.046 --> 07:57.246
Pick a side and stick to it.

07:57.824 --> 07:59.323
Do you know

07:59.391 --> 08:01.216
what you've done?

08:01.318 --> 08:04.720
The years I spent planning my death.

08:04.822 --> 08:06.689
Now you've ruined it.

08:06.791 --> 08:08.257
Master.

08:08.359 --> 08:10.693
The woman you gave the Demon's Head to.

08:10.795 --> 08:14.930
- She started a war.
- I started that war.

08:15.032 --> 08:16.932
The League of Shadows was rotten,

08:17.034 --> 08:20.469
and only through violence
could it be reborn.

08:24.256 --> 08:28.610
Master, our lives are yours to take.

08:28.713 --> 08:31.980
But this woman does not serve
the League.

08:32.535 --> 08:35.703
Her goals are limited. Selfish.

08:35.789 --> 08:37.167
That's Barbara, all right.

08:37.238 --> 08:39.488
Whatever faith
you had in her was misplaced.

08:39.590 --> 08:41.724
If she keeps the Demon's Head,
the League shall die.

08:41.826 --> 08:45.594
Wait, what do you mean, if
she keeps the Demon's Head?

08:46.203 --> 08:48.633
I thought you were supposed
to get it the second you...

08:48.712 --> 08:49.932
came back.

08:50.034 --> 08:51.133
No.

08:51.235 --> 08:53.802
Barbara must give it to me.

08:55.873 --> 08:57.639
She'll never do that.

08:58.305 --> 09:02.821
Then, I'll kill her and rip it
from her corpse.

09:10.450 --> 09:11.841
You owe us.

09:13.029 --> 09:15.328
I-I'm sorry.

09:15.371 --> 09:16.570
We owe you how?

09:16.646 --> 09:19.446
Because we made you.

09:19.532 --> 09:21.131
Both of you.

09:21.188 --> 09:24.493
Without me, you would still
be trapped inside Ed.

09:24.900 --> 09:26.516
And you would still be

09:26.552 --> 09:28.518
stitching up busted lips ringside.

09:28.554 --> 09:32.122
I need money to buy back Sofia's capos.

09:32.157 --> 09:35.525
Butch is saving for
future medical expenses.

09:36.562 --> 09:39.263
What'd you make last night?
Three, four million?

09:40.227 --> 09:41.924
Say we go halvsies.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.979
I've heard your offer.

09:45.237 --> 09:47.217
And here's my counter:

09:47.252 --> 09:48.218
bite me.

09:48.253 --> 09:49.652
I don't like people

09:49.688 --> 09:52.055
coming into my club,
telling me what to do.

09:52.090 --> 09:55.240
And I don't like threats,
implicit or otherwise.

09:55.350 --> 09:59.062
And I really don't like people
telling me they "made" me.

09:59.097 --> 10:00.763
Well said, Lee.

10:04.236 --> 10:06.569
Oh, God, are you kidding me?

10:06.605 --> 10:08.504
- What?
- Okay, we're done.

10:08.540 --> 10:10.240
I-I thought you got past all that

10:10.275 --> 10:11.574
when you became the Riddler.

10:11.610 --> 10:12.742
Past what?

10:13.281 --> 10:15.378
Ed's pathetic adoration of her.

10:16.615 --> 10:19.898
But, no, clearly
he passed it along to you.

10:19.985 --> 10:21.651
Like a virus.

10:21.734 --> 10:24.053
She knows it, and she's using you.

10:24.089 --> 10:26.256
Shame on you.

10:26.291 --> 10:28.024
Stringing along this troubled man.

10:28.059 --> 10:29.192
Get out.

10:29.227 --> 10:31.410
- I don't think so.
- W...

10:31.563 --> 10:34.583
We did not come here for violence.

10:34.766 --> 10:37.367
We came here hoping our friends
would honor their debts.

10:37.402 --> 10:39.535
Let us hope they come to their senses.

10:42.146 --> 10:44.207
Little advice:

10:44.859 --> 10:49.051
be sure to skim some off the top
when she tosses you aside.

11:07.832 --> 11:11.234
Kind of defeats the purpose
if I can hear you.

11:11.269 --> 11:13.436
Hello, Barbara.

11:16.508 --> 11:18.271
Ra's...

11:18.610 --> 11:20.276
Don't be afraid.

11:20.888 --> 11:24.414
What happened? How are you even...?

11:24.449 --> 11:26.516
It's a long story.

11:26.551 --> 11:30.653
But tell me,
what have you done with my gift?

11:32.278 --> 11:34.473
Well, you might've left a how-to.

11:34.559 --> 11:35.925
Plus a heads up

11:35.960 --> 11:37.827
to your League of Shadows cronies.

11:37.862 --> 11:39.295
Turns out the old boys club

11:39.331 --> 11:41.764
don't appreciate a woman
calling the shots.

11:41.800 --> 11:44.382
But you have plans

11:45.170 --> 11:46.910
on rebuilding the League of Shadows?

11:46.973 --> 11:51.140
You've read the histories
that I left for you?

11:51.176 --> 11:54.351
I've read them, but I need
to do my own thing.

11:54.646 --> 11:57.585
Your own thing?

11:58.859 --> 12:01.872
With the power you gave me,
I can rule Gotham

12:01.927 --> 12:04.247
like no one ever has before.

12:04.322 --> 12:07.427
The people will worship me like a queen.

12:07.505 --> 12:09.869
How disappointing.

12:11.197 --> 12:12.963
You're right.

12:13.041 --> 12:15.631
- They should worship me like a god.
- Enough.

12:15.673 --> 12:18.301
Give me your hand
so that I can take it back.

12:19.371 --> 12:23.206
No. It is mine. You promised me.

12:23.909 --> 12:27.440
I was mistaken in you, Barbara.

12:27.522 --> 12:31.157
Mistaken? Tell that to her.

12:32.215 --> 12:35.841
You think that is you?

12:40.466 --> 12:44.304
She was just a whore.

12:46.046 --> 12:49.929
I killed her out of pity.

12:50.243 --> 12:52.530
You're lying.

12:52.811 --> 12:55.054
The Demon's Head is my destiny.

12:55.120 --> 12:59.489
Then why have you not
unlocked its secrets?

12:59.611 --> 13:02.046
You sad,

13:02.161 --> 13:04.778
deluded woman.

13:05.283 --> 13:08.518
You thought you were
a reincarnated queen,

13:09.747 --> 13:11.354
but in truth,

13:11.389 --> 13:16.025
you're just an unstable nightclub owner,

13:16.060 --> 13:18.094
whose greatest accomplishment

13:18.136 --> 13:21.053
was the murder of her own parents.

13:21.534 --> 13:23.767
You are nothing.

13:24.672 --> 13:27.336
Now, give me your hand,

13:27.414 --> 13:32.165
or I will kill you and take
the Demon's Head by force.

13:34.288 --> 13:36.255
Try it, zombie boy.

13:59.137 --> 14:01.904
Get her out of here. Go!

14:09.854 --> 14:12.020
I'm fine.

14:18.857 --> 14:20.122
Get in!

14:36.423 --> 14:38.235
All right, you know the rules.

14:38.322 --> 14:40.181
Hands only, no drinking water.

14:40.267 --> 14:42.434
I want a good, clean eat. Ready?

14:42.536 --> 14:44.759
Ready?

14:47.107 --> 14:49.041
- Come on, eat it, eat it!
- Go, go, come on!

14:50.699 --> 14:53.500
I'm looking for Lee Thompkins.

14:53.813 --> 14:55.475
The Doc.

15:04.072 --> 15:05.304
Lee?

15:09.029 --> 15:10.529
The winner!

15:10.631 --> 15:13.799
Jim. You don't look like a guy
who got shot four times.

15:13.901 --> 15:16.001
Because you were able to keep me alive.

15:16.103 --> 15:17.636
Thanks.

15:17.753 --> 15:19.330
I just just shot
Sofia Falcone in the head.

15:19.384 --> 15:20.916
I was in a good mood.

15:22.909 --> 15:25.310
I'm looking for Ed Nygma.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.626
Five banks were robbed last night.

15:27.680 --> 15:30.063
Has all the hallmarks
of a Nygma special.

15:30.141 --> 15:32.117
Haven't seen Ed in weeks.

15:33.968 --> 15:36.335
I know you feel loyalty towards him,

15:36.405 --> 15:38.305
but you of all people
should know he's sick.

15:38.407 --> 15:42.409
- He's a psychopath.
- We all have our flaws.

15:42.511 --> 15:44.144
Lee.

15:45.177 --> 15:47.314
I can understand why you're here.

15:47.416 --> 15:50.183
But there are other ways
of finding absolution.

15:50.285 --> 15:52.881
You can't take ownership
of everyone's problems.

15:52.982 --> 15:54.354
This is the Narrows.

15:54.456 --> 15:57.616
Nobody owns anything down here
but the slumlords.

15:57.702 --> 15:59.507
Why don't you try going
after the real criminals?

15:59.609 --> 16:01.795
The people making money
off the backs of the poor.

16:02.787 --> 16:05.321
You mean like Gotham Savings and Loan?

16:07.102 --> 16:09.164
None of the guards were killed.

16:09.289 --> 16:11.274
The more I think about it,
doesn't exactly feel

16:11.360 --> 16:12.773
like Ed Nygma.

16:12.875 --> 16:14.274
Or not just him.

16:14.376 --> 16:16.109
If we're done here...

16:19.782 --> 16:21.314
Whatever's happened,

16:21.417 --> 16:22.949
you can always call me.

16:23.052 --> 16:25.137
I can help.

16:26.917 --> 16:28.955
You really don't get it, do you, Jim?

16:30.926 --> 16:32.959
It was good to see you.

16:42.889 --> 16:45.205
Ra's just tried to kill me
because of you.

16:45.307 --> 16:46.873
You could've just given
him the Demon's Paw.

16:46.975 --> 16:50.710
Head! It's the Demon's Head!
And it is mine!

16:50.813 --> 16:52.412
You betrayed me.

16:52.514 --> 16:55.012
I was trying to save you from yourself.

16:55.059 --> 16:55.982
Also, the other day,

16:56.085 --> 16:58.251
you actually told your thugs to kill me.

16:58.353 --> 16:59.886
It was a spanking.

16:59.988 --> 17:01.254
If I wanted you dead,
I would've done it...

17:01.356 --> 17:03.513
Oh, shut up, both of you!

17:03.583 --> 17:06.526
We're wasting time. Ra's could
be on his way right now.

17:06.627 --> 17:07.928
Which wouldn't be a problem
if Barbara would just

17:08.030 --> 17:09.396
give him what he wants.
Never gonna happen.

17:09.498 --> 17:10.809
Okay, so what are we gonna do, Barbara?

17:10.887 --> 17:13.066
We're just gonna walk around
with targets on our backs?

17:13.167 --> 17:16.047
No. We're gonna kill the son of a bitch.

17:16.272 --> 17:17.637
The kid did it before, right?

17:17.739 --> 17:19.673
Yeah, but that was different.
We had, like, a special knife.

17:19.775 --> 17:21.932
Yeah, that one you got from auction?
Where is it?

17:22.018 --> 17:23.510
We gave it back to
the Nanda Parbat embassy.

17:23.612 --> 17:25.712
Great. So we'll just do
a little smash and grab,

17:25.814 --> 17:27.114
and then I'll filet the zombie.

17:27.215 --> 17:29.649
I have to be the one holding the knife.

17:30.719 --> 17:32.419
It's part of the ritual.

17:32.918 --> 17:34.721
Like the blood.

17:35.690 --> 17:37.991
I have to kill him again.

17:39.205 --> 17:41.017
Even if that's the case, Master Bruce,

17:41.095 --> 17:42.220
I can't allow you to do it, not again.

17:42.267 --> 17:44.798
We might not get another chance, Alfred.

17:44.900 --> 17:46.566
This is the only way.

17:46.668 --> 17:49.035
Says you, the mystical knife expert.

17:49.138 --> 17:51.077
I've got the Demon's Head.

17:51.155 --> 17:53.507
I bet if I'm holding it in my hand...

17:54.176 --> 17:57.061
What if killing Ra's unlocks my powers?

17:57.610 --> 17:59.744
Yeah, and what if you fail,
and Ra's gets the knife back?

17:59.815 --> 18:00.957
We'll worry about who kills him later.

18:01.028 --> 18:02.415
Right now, we have to get
the knife before Ra's does.

18:02.518 --> 18:03.617
Embassies are heavily guarded,

18:03.719 --> 18:04.918
and we can't wait till night.

18:05.020 --> 18:06.887
We're gonna need guns,

18:06.989 --> 18:08.288
smoke grenades to cause a diversion.

18:08.390 --> 18:11.011
If I may, there may be another option.

18:11.917 --> 18:14.450
But you got to guarantee you're
not gonna stab us in the back.

18:15.144 --> 18:16.229
Again.

18:20.002 --> 18:21.455
So, in short,

18:21.564 --> 18:22.769
we'd like to thank you very much...

18:22.879 --> 18:24.127
both of us would like to thank you

18:24.212 --> 18:27.392
for taking such good...
such good care of her,

18:27.525 --> 18:30.357
but now we'd like to take
the knife home, please.

18:31.960 --> 18:33.922
Wh... It was never yours

18:34.016 --> 18:36.016
to begin with, Mr. Pennyworth.

18:36.118 --> 18:38.585
It belongs to my people.

18:38.687 --> 18:41.581
When Mr. Bruce Wayne
purchased it at auction,

18:41.691 --> 18:44.980
he was rescuing
a looted historical treasure.

18:46.144 --> 18:48.595
That's why you returned it to us.

18:48.697 --> 18:51.398
Yeah, but it was a loan,
wasn't it, mate?

18:52.413 --> 18:54.929
It was never meant as a keepsie.

18:55.604 --> 18:59.078
This knife is worth millions,
and you just gave it away?

18:59.179 --> 19:02.008
- You idiot!
- Easy, muffin.

19:04.780 --> 19:05.946
Look, you look like you got

19:06.048 --> 19:08.034
a stable head on your shoulders.

19:08.320 --> 19:10.654
Why don't I make a little donation,

19:11.053 --> 19:12.953
and you give us the knife.

19:13.055 --> 19:15.288
And we walk away.

19:15.390 --> 19:17.524
Does Bruce Wayne even know about this?

19:19.995 --> 19:22.896
Whatever your agenda is,

19:22.998 --> 19:26.900
I believe that you and
your chippie should leave.

19:26.995 --> 19:28.925
A chippie?

19:28.999 --> 19:31.466
Did you just call my missus a chippie?

19:31.740 --> 19:34.007
What is that, like...

19:34.109 --> 19:36.977
What... A chippie?
Is that a new term or something?

19:37.079 --> 19:38.812
Something...

19:38.914 --> 19:40.513
- What...
- What?

19:40.616 --> 19:43.016
- What's happening?
- I can't breathe.

19:43.118 --> 19:44.687
Oh, my God! I think
he's having a heart attack.

19:44.757 --> 19:46.398
- I can't breathe! I can't breathe!
- He's having a heart attack!

19:46.467 --> 19:47.295
Ow!

19:47.367 --> 19:49.487
- Look what you did.
- Tell security it's a false alarm.

19:49.558 --> 19:50.768
- I can't breathe.
- False alarm.

19:50.839 --> 19:52.167
I can't breathe! I can't
breathe! I can't breathe!

19:52.237 --> 19:53.927
Give me your jacket.
Put your jacket under his head.

19:54.029 --> 19:54.928
Put your jacket.

19:56.131 --> 19:58.798
It really hurts.
It really, it really hurts.

20:00.469 --> 20:01.768
You're okay.

20:01.870 --> 20:03.211
Continue breathing.

20:03.305 --> 20:05.002
- Deep breaths.
- All right, you're doing just fine.

20:05.107 --> 20:06.994
Ow, it really hurts.

20:08.345 --> 20:09.743
Stay with me here.

20:09.845 --> 20:11.811
Oh, I feel much better now.

20:16.285 --> 20:19.519
Sorry about the fuss. Fellas.

20:19.621 --> 20:21.021
Chippie.

20:26.833 --> 20:27.871
Ah...

20:36.888 --> 20:38.801
<i>And she's using you.</i>

20:38.886 --> 20:40.352
<i>Shame on you.</i>

20:40.427 --> 20:42.160
<i>Stringing along this troubled man.</i>

20:42.195 --> 20:44.353
This troubled man.

20:44.419 --> 20:46.853
Ooh, can't argue with that.

20:46.966 --> 20:48.232
Oh, no.

20:48.268 --> 20:50.023
Sorry, just because you're in charge

20:50.070 --> 20:51.031
doesn't mean I disappear.

20:51.094 --> 20:55.063
That's because you're too stupid
to know when you've lost.

20:55.098 --> 20:57.131
Have I?

20:57.167 --> 20:59.300
"Lee, what am I to you?"

20:59.343 --> 21:02.737
Does that sound like you to you?
Because to me,

21:02.772 --> 21:04.981
that sounds like me.

21:05.068 --> 21:06.443
I'm not proud of that phrasing.

21:06.478 --> 21:08.445
I'm inside you, buddy,

21:08.480 --> 21:10.484
like a virus,

21:10.570 --> 21:13.317
- infecting your thoughts.
- Oh, please.

21:13.352 --> 21:15.437
You couldn't even begin
to comprehend my thoughts,

21:15.476 --> 21:17.087
much less influence them.

21:17.122 --> 21:19.990
What about your feelings?
How else would you explain those

21:20.025 --> 21:23.060
desperate attempts to gain her approval?

21:23.341 --> 21:26.544
No, no. If anything,
she's the one who...

21:26.614 --> 21:29.466
You gave money away to the poor.

21:29.501 --> 21:31.802
That was part of a larger plan.

21:31.837 --> 21:35.153
Yeah, her plan. What did you
ever care about the Narrows?

21:35.216 --> 21:36.406
I don't.

21:36.442 --> 21:40.077
Every person here could drown
in a stew of their own filth

21:40.102 --> 21:42.002
and I wouldn't lose a wink of sleep.

21:42.047 --> 21:43.705
Oh, I know...

21:44.345 --> 21:47.851
because all you care about is her.

21:47.886 --> 21:49.453
Just like I did.

21:49.488 --> 21:50.877
So keep that up, buddy,

21:50.923 --> 21:52.856
'cause soon there will no telling

21:52.891 --> 21:55.158
where you end and I begin.

22:00.733 --> 22:02.933
That's not gonna happen.

22:09.141 --> 22:10.540
Well done.

22:10.576 --> 22:12.409
Now, knife, please.

22:13.479 --> 22:16.258
Selina, it has to be me.

22:16.849 --> 22:18.148
Selina.

22:18.885 --> 22:20.518
Give me the knife.

22:20.610 --> 22:22.519
And you better scram
while you still can.

22:22.554 --> 22:23.954
I'm taking the knife.

22:23.989 --> 22:26.740
Oh, you do not want
to make me angry, kid.

22:26.802 --> 22:27.826
Sorry, muffin.

22:27.873 --> 22:29.045
I'm gonna need you to step back.

22:29.109 --> 22:30.568
Don't you even go there, love.

22:30.630 --> 22:32.162
Selina, don't give her the knife.

22:32.197 --> 22:33.497
Screw this.

22:37.344 --> 22:39.878
Your arrogance is gonna get
someone killed, you know.

22:39.940 --> 22:40.904
Or just you.

22:40.939 --> 22:42.139
- What?
- Stop.

22:46.912 --> 22:48.812
Thank you.

22:48.847 --> 22:51.648
Now. Get in.

22:53.352 --> 22:54.818
Selina, let's go.

23:06.699 --> 23:09.332
Nice doing business with you boys.

23:19.812 --> 23:21.599
You were right.

23:21.980 --> 23:24.162
She's using me.

23:24.416 --> 23:25.951
Finally.

23:26.418 --> 23:29.286
So much for you being smart now.

23:29.321 --> 23:31.254
The most brilliant minds are often blind

23:31.290 --> 23:32.689
to the most obvious truths.

23:32.725 --> 23:34.324
Fine.

23:34.359 --> 23:36.293
And you came to me...

23:36.328 --> 23:38.462
Because that lovestruck moron, Ed,

23:38.497 --> 23:40.564
is floating down a river of dopamine

23:40.599 --> 23:43.110
deep within the primitive
reward circuit of my brain

23:43.180 --> 23:45.368
and I need you to help me drown him

23:45.404 --> 23:46.870
for good.

23:46.905 --> 23:49.473
Did you bring the half-share
of profits we asked for?

23:49.508 --> 23:50.707
That money's gone.

23:50.743 --> 23:53.043
Distributed among the riffraff
of the Narrows,

23:53.078 --> 23:55.109
but...

23:55.848 --> 23:59.416
those five banks were merely
the first stage

23:59.451 --> 24:02.312
of a very sophisticated plan.

24:02.680 --> 24:05.789
And the coup de grâce is tonight.

24:06.008 --> 24:08.458
I knew you were scheming something.

24:10.273 --> 24:12.496
That's why we were
gonna rob you afterward.

24:13.557 --> 24:15.966
But I prefer this way.

24:16.001 --> 24:18.769
There better be enough
in there to get me fixed.

24:18.804 --> 24:20.403
Don't forget our deal.

24:20.439 --> 24:21.638
I won't.

24:21.673 --> 24:24.608
Thank you so much.
And how big is the score?

24:24.643 --> 24:26.243
About a hundred million...

24:27.780 --> 24:29.446
...apiece.

24:34.286 --> 24:37.087
And you help me deal with Lee Thompkins.

24:44.897 --> 24:47.130
Thank you for coming back.

24:47.166 --> 24:49.933
We serve the Demon's Head, Barbara.

24:49.968 --> 24:51.535
So what's the play?

24:51.570 --> 24:55.539
Simple. I do the flashlight-hand
thingy, summon Ra's,

24:55.574 --> 24:57.407
a little stabby-stab with the knife,

24:57.442 --> 24:58.942
send him back to hell.

24:58.977 --> 25:00.844
Think I can remember that.

25:00.879 --> 25:03.180
You can't be serious.

25:03.215 --> 25:04.948
That's your plan?

25:04.983 --> 25:06.483
How do you expect to get the drop

25:06.518 --> 25:09.613
on someone who's studied
kung fu for 2,000 years

25:09.668 --> 25:11.011
and is a zombie?

25:11.058 --> 25:13.004
Not feeling a whole lot
of faith here, kitty cat.

25:13.058 --> 25:14.224
Maybe I'd have a little more

25:14.259 --> 25:15.629
if you knew how to use your Demon Head

25:15.668 --> 25:18.195
for something other than a flashlight.

25:18.230 --> 25:19.729
You're gonna get us killed.

25:19.765 --> 25:21.298
You got any useful suggestions?

25:21.333 --> 25:22.299
Maybe call backup.

25:22.334 --> 25:23.667
I did.

25:23.702 --> 25:24.701
Here they are.

25:24.736 --> 25:26.136
What if Bruce is right?

25:26.171 --> 25:27.320
Let him use the knife.

25:27.382 --> 25:29.306
At least we know that it worked before.

25:29.341 --> 25:31.007
You just took the knife from him.

25:31.043 --> 25:32.309
Because you told me to pick a side.

25:32.344 --> 25:33.743
I thought you had some other plan

25:33.779 --> 25:36.528
other than "Let's stab
the immortal, undead guy

25:36.567 --> 25:37.667
and hope for the best."

25:37.692 --> 25:40.520
Listen, Selina, we're strongest
when we're together.

25:40.686 --> 25:42.319
Now are you in or are you out?

25:42.354 --> 25:44.321
If it's suicide by Ra's, I'm out.

25:44.356 --> 25:46.251
Fine, then go.

25:55.100 --> 25:56.533
What if she's right?

25:57.505 --> 25:59.603
I can't control the Demon's Head.

26:00.521 --> 26:02.205
Maybe it's like Ra's said.

26:02.271 --> 26:06.343
Maybe... I am just a nightclub owner.

26:06.924 --> 26:09.603
I should've never trusted those men.

26:10.506 --> 26:13.001
I didn't want you to
have the Demon's Head.

26:13.141 --> 26:15.018
Not even sure I want it now.

26:17.422 --> 26:20.390
Three years we've been
together, on and off.

26:21.299 --> 26:24.194
And I've never seen you doubt yourself.

26:24.541 --> 26:27.364
So however you want
to play this, I'm in.

26:27.399 --> 26:29.855
But if you're saying you're not worthy,

26:30.402 --> 26:32.269
that's where I jump ship.

26:35.007 --> 26:36.473
Let's do this.

26:56.746 --> 26:58.174
I suppose on the bright side,

26:58.233 --> 27:00.967
you won't have to kill him... again.

27:01.643 --> 27:03.035
Except I'm the only one who can.

27:03.114 --> 27:05.902
So said Ra's.

27:06.050 --> 27:08.351
I mean, no disrespect to your
magical daggers and all of that,

27:08.386 --> 27:09.676
but I'd love to see what would happen

27:09.717 --> 27:12.251
if I pulled his head
off his bloody shoulders.

27:12.490 --> 27:15.091
I can't believe Selina
gave Barbara the knife.

27:16.661 --> 27:18.794
Yeah, well...

27:18.830 --> 27:20.196
at least we know where she stands.

27:20.387 --> 27:22.840
That's what you think.

27:24.359 --> 27:27.727
Oh, you've got bloody
cheek turning up here.

27:29.173 --> 27:33.142
I gave Barbara the knife
because if there was a chance

27:33.177 --> 27:34.914
she could use it, I wanted her to.

27:34.985 --> 27:37.164
That way Bruce didn't have to kill him.

27:37.226 --> 27:39.054
I would've done what I had to do.

27:39.117 --> 27:40.748
And you would've gone straight
back to being the douche bag

27:40.773 --> 27:42.070
you've been the last few months.

27:42.101 --> 27:44.183
So, no. Thank you.

27:44.253 --> 27:45.353
She's got a point there, Master Bruce.

27:45.388 --> 27:47.690
Thanks for the explanation.
You can leave now.

27:47.737 --> 27:50.191
- Bruce.
- You sided with them.

27:51.072 --> 27:54.502
Why does it have to be about sides?

27:54.541 --> 27:55.730
There is somebody,

27:55.765 --> 27:57.732
some thing out there
that needs to be stopped,

27:57.759 --> 28:00.293
so why can't we focus on that?

28:00.336 --> 28:02.370
Another good point.

28:02.405 --> 28:06.307
Barbara and Tabitha are gonna
get themselves killed.

28:06.342 --> 28:08.976
And I don't want that to happen.

28:15.184 --> 28:17.894
There were easier banks to hit.

28:18.792 --> 28:20.121
Why yours?

28:20.156 --> 28:23.557
I keep telling you, I have no idea.

28:24.217 --> 28:26.394
I'm the victim.
You're treating me like a criminal.

28:26.429 --> 28:28.262
Yeah, I wonder where we get that from.

28:29.198 --> 28:31.584
- Excuse me?
- We did some digging.

28:31.631 --> 28:35.678
Your bank has been investigated
for redlining, usury,

28:35.740 --> 28:38.592
- illegal foreclosures.
- And cleared on all counts.

28:38.678 --> 28:40.141
You have good lawyers.

28:40.777 --> 28:43.099
So we deserve to be robbed?

28:44.313 --> 28:45.685
- I'm done here.
- Ma'am,

28:45.755 --> 28:48.416
can you just give us a second, please?

28:54.657 --> 28:56.191
What the hell are you doing?!

28:56.222 --> 28:58.259
She's a crook, a bigger crook
than whoever ripped her off.

28:58.294 --> 28:59.827
You mean like Lee?

28:59.862 --> 29:01.362
Look, brother, I know
what this is about.

29:01.397 --> 29:02.496
You went down to the Narrows

29:02.547 --> 29:04.165
and came back all fired up, okay?

29:04.200 --> 29:06.767
But alienating her is not gonna help us.

29:06.803 --> 29:08.869
If Lee is involved with Nygma,

29:08.905 --> 29:11.602
we got to stop it before it goes bad.

29:16.145 --> 29:18.446
Which of your branches
are the most vulnerable?

29:18.481 --> 29:20.548
As of this afternoon, none of them.

29:20.583 --> 29:23.184
We have a security protocol.

29:23.219 --> 29:25.052
After the Arkham breakout
and the robberies...

29:25.087 --> 29:26.720
You moved your assets
to a secure location.

29:26.756 --> 29:28.155
Yes, of course.

29:28.191 --> 29:30.691
All 45 branches this morning.

29:31.661 --> 29:34.462
It's totally safe.

29:34.497 --> 29:36.897
- Fortified and heavily guarded.
- Where is it?

29:45.107 --> 29:48.242
- Pistol would've been more fun.
- You indulge me.

29:48.277 --> 29:50.244
Breaking open the vault
is the last detail.

29:50.279 --> 29:52.713
Big detail. How did you solve it?

29:52.748 --> 29:54.482
A little help from some friends.

29:56.252 --> 29:58.719
I'm the revealer of masks.

29:59.174 --> 30:00.921
When I appear,

30:01.611 --> 30:03.757
friend becomes foe.

30:03.932 --> 30:07.945
And the one that you love
becomes the one that you hate.

30:08.024 --> 30:09.656
What am I?

30:09.743 --> 30:11.543
Betrayal.

30:11.734 --> 30:14.149
Hello, Lee.

30:14.776 --> 30:17.307
Yeah, it's not a dart gun.

30:17.383 --> 30:19.018
Let's go.

30:54.030 --> 30:55.543
Nice entrance.

30:55.578 --> 30:57.378
I do hope you've reconsidered

30:57.413 --> 30:59.713
and are planning to give me what I want.

30:59.749 --> 31:03.284
I've thought about it a lot

31:03.874 --> 31:05.859
and about us.

31:06.195 --> 31:08.691
We had something, didn't we?

31:08.758 --> 31:11.292
Back when you were less dug-up-y.

31:11.327 --> 31:13.661
I do not have time for this.

31:13.696 --> 31:15.663
I will give you what you want, Ra's.

31:16.629 --> 31:19.608
But I want you to admit
we had a connection

31:19.869 --> 31:23.070
and that those things you said
to me were just mind games

31:23.105 --> 31:24.605
to make me lose my nerve.

31:24.937 --> 31:28.409
You want me to tell you
that you're special?

31:28.976 --> 31:30.578
Would that be so hard?

31:30.998 --> 31:32.646
No.

31:33.762 --> 31:37.014
And moreover, it's true.

31:37.123 --> 31:39.233
You are special.

31:39.488 --> 31:42.923
I'm just sorry it had
to come to this, Barbara.

31:44.994 --> 31:46.460
Me, too.

31:47.930 --> 31:50.166
But thank you for saying that.

31:55.607 --> 31:57.245
Ouch.

32:00.009 --> 32:02.176
She must do this by herself.

32:18.661 --> 32:20.494
Barbara, fight.

32:28.738 --> 32:31.405
This is Barbara's fight.

32:57.433 --> 32:59.688
This is Barbara's fight!

33:03.414 --> 33:06.407
Well, now... look at you.

33:06.442 --> 33:08.242
Yeah, look at me.

33:08.277 --> 33:10.469
You want to give it another shot?

33:17.586 --> 33:19.811
She's mastered the Demon's Head.

33:19.843 --> 33:21.355
Wow.

33:21.390 --> 33:23.590
I can see why he likes this thing.

33:23.626 --> 33:25.959
That's enough.

33:25.995 --> 33:30.431
Give me what I want,
or your friend dies.

33:30.466 --> 33:32.466
I thought this was between us.

33:32.501 --> 33:35.202
Choose now.

33:39.975 --> 33:42.076
Tabby, I...

33:43.589 --> 33:45.579
I can't give this up.

33:57.221 --> 33:59.948
No!

34:04.414 --> 34:07.582
That's enough. Choose.

34:07.703 --> 34:09.503
Now.

34:14.871 --> 34:15.969
You win.

34:18.404 --> 34:20.333
Just don't hurt her.

34:27.489 --> 34:29.556
Barbara Kean,

34:29.681 --> 34:32.119
you surprise me yet again.

34:32.588 --> 34:35.661
Maybe I wasn't mistaken
in you after all.

35:18.542 --> 35:20.955
Give me the knife, Ra's.

35:21.076 --> 35:22.509
Let me kill you.

35:27.383 --> 35:29.716
Today is not the day that I die.

35:53.864 --> 35:56.398
This is the price for
taking advantage of me, Lee.

35:56.500 --> 35:58.405
You're wrong, Ed. I wasn't using you.

35:58.461 --> 36:00.227
Again, don't call me Ed.

36:00.304 --> 36:02.270
And I'm not wrong about you.

36:02.372 --> 36:04.773
The truck is almost
full... we should go.

36:04.875 --> 36:06.775
Tell the ogre. Have him leave
the property deeds.

36:06.877 --> 36:08.576
They all belong to the Narrows.

36:08.679 --> 36:09.778
Worthless.

36:11.645 --> 36:14.779
And so ends the tale of
the Queen of the Narrows.

36:14.851 --> 36:17.285
Mm. Good-bye, Lee.

36:21.925 --> 36:24.592
- What are you doing?
- How did that go, again?

36:24.711 --> 36:26.644
"I am the revealer of masks.

36:26.730 --> 36:30.031
"When I appear, friend becomes foe."

36:30.172 --> 36:33.331
- Betrayal.
- Exactly.

36:41.159 --> 36:42.450
What the hell you doing?!

36:42.519 --> 36:43.878
Just burning the Narrows property deeds.

36:43.957 --> 36:45.042
Not that.

36:45.136 --> 36:48.316
He's proving his love by betraying us.

36:48.418 --> 36:50.251
These bars can't hold me.
When I get out...

36:50.354 --> 36:51.886
We'll be gone.

36:51.989 --> 36:53.989
I just wanted you to hear something.

36:55.592 --> 36:57.559
Oswald, we have been
through thick and thin.

36:57.661 --> 37:01.005
And I hold no grudge on you.

37:02.153 --> 37:04.499
But you come against Lee,

37:04.616 --> 37:06.036
and you come against me.

37:07.004 --> 37:10.071
I'm gonna dismember you, you twerp!

37:10.173 --> 37:11.539
Yeah, not even gonna try with you.

37:12.517 --> 37:14.017
Let's go, Lee.

37:14.111 --> 37:15.610
It won't make any difference.

37:15.712 --> 37:18.013
She's still using you.

37:18.115 --> 37:21.950
You are not the Riddler! You are a fool!

37:22.052 --> 37:23.985
God!

37:28.191 --> 37:29.324
Why do that?

37:29.426 --> 37:30.959
Why bring Penguin and Grundy

37:31.061 --> 37:32.460
if you're just gonna lock them inside?

37:32.562 --> 37:34.029
I needed Grundy to open the vault.

37:34.131 --> 37:35.418
And Oswald was gonna rob us, anyway,

37:35.496 --> 37:37.165
so I just kept an eye on him.

37:37.267 --> 37:38.767
He'll get over it, or he won't.

37:38.869 --> 37:41.436
So you don't think I'm using you?

37:41.538 --> 37:43.671
No, I know you are.

37:44.043 --> 37:46.465
Then why would you
betray your friends for me?

37:47.411 --> 37:50.289
Is this... Are you Ed?

37:50.391 --> 37:51.980
No, I'm me.

37:52.082 --> 37:53.548
How can you be sure?

37:53.650 --> 37:56.017
Because Ed didn't understand you.

37:56.119 --> 37:59.835
He didn't see how deeply
you had changed. I do.

37:59.929 --> 38:02.057
I know that that virus

38:02.159 --> 38:04.882
woke up something deep inside you,

38:05.562 --> 38:08.463
and you let that something loose
when you shot Sofia.

38:09.250 --> 38:11.533
And you love it.

38:13.303 --> 38:14.736
And I love it, too.

38:14.838 --> 38:17.405
And I know that you don't
feel the same way about me.

38:19.910 --> 38:21.894
But you will.

38:22.511 --> 38:25.722
And when you do, I will be here.

38:28.285 --> 38:30.016
Ed Nygma...

38:30.287 --> 38:32.618
you are a riddle.

38:33.594 --> 38:35.516
That's the nicest thing
someone's said to me.

38:37.661 --> 38:40.728
- That's Jim.
- This alarm just went off.

38:40.831 --> 38:42.030
He was onto us.

38:42.132 --> 38:45.245
- We can just go out the back.
- No, they'll see the truck.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.835
One of us needs to distract them.

38:48.805 --> 38:50.405
Done.

38:50.507 --> 38:52.740
No.

38:52.843 --> 38:54.609
I can handle Jim Gordon.

38:54.711 --> 38:57.212
You take the money to the Narrows.

38:57.314 --> 38:59.999
You trust me?

39:00.120 --> 39:01.620
I do.

39:05.188 --> 39:06.521
Go.

39:16.362 --> 39:17.932
GCPD.

39:18.034 --> 39:19.534
Nygma, we know you're in there.

39:19.636 --> 39:21.102
Come out with your hands up.

39:28.478 --> 39:30.078
Sweet, merciful mother.

39:39.402 --> 39:41.389
You know your rights.

40:32.776 --> 40:35.410
You'd have done the same for me.

40:48.158 --> 40:49.991
Ladies.

40:50.093 --> 40:51.292
I hope this isn't one of those

40:51.394 --> 40:53.895
kill the old queen situations.

40:53.997 --> 40:55.463
We discussed things.

40:55.565 --> 40:58.800
Demon's Head or not, you fought.

40:58.902 --> 41:01.871
Not for yourself,
but those alongside you.

41:02.976 --> 41:05.307
You are worthy, Barbara Kean.

41:10.914 --> 41:12.347
We follow you

41:12.449 --> 41:14.115
to our deaths and beyond.

41:23.874 --> 41:25.660
We can find from Barbara
where the League hides:

41:25.762 --> 41:27.762
temples, safe houses...
he'll be in one of them.

41:27.864 --> 41:29.197
Meanwhile, we'll try to fix the knife...

41:29.299 --> 41:30.832
Yeah, we'll just take it
to the magic knife shop,

41:30.934 --> 41:32.433
no problem.

41:32.535 --> 41:34.669
- Selena, be serious.
- I am.

41:34.771 --> 41:36.771
If Ra's wanted you dead, you would be.

41:36.873 --> 41:39.073
He obviously likes you.

41:39.175 --> 41:41.242
- It's not about me.
- I know it's not about you.

41:43.613 --> 41:47.048
Gotham has managed
a long time without you.

41:47.150 --> 41:48.916
It can manage a little longer

41:49.019 --> 41:50.585
if you have one night off.

41:56.250 --> 41:57.983
You did good today.

42:01.538 --> 42:03.865
So did you.

42:03.967 --> 42:05.967
Ahem. Poor timing.

42:06.069 --> 42:08.036
Apologies.

42:08.138 --> 42:10.138
I only want to talk.

42:10.240 --> 42:12.140
Alone, please.

42:12.242 --> 42:14.008
I'm staying.

42:16.179 --> 42:17.945
Very well.

42:18.048 --> 42:20.114
She's right, you know, Bruce.

42:20.216 --> 42:21.549
I do like you.

42:21.651 --> 42:23.785
Respect you. Respect you
for what you'll become.

42:27.497 --> 42:29.730
You have no idea what I'll become.

42:29.826 --> 42:31.251
Of course I do.

42:31.361 --> 42:34.998
At least, who you could become.

42:35.932 --> 42:37.710
Why are you here?

42:37.757 --> 42:39.267
I felt I owed you an explanation

42:39.369 --> 42:41.669
as to why I chose to live.

42:41.771 --> 42:43.905
When I took back the Demon's Head,

42:44.007 --> 42:45.606
I saw...

42:45.709 --> 42:48.342
a vision...

42:48.845 --> 42:52.347
of a cataclysmic event
soon to befall this city.

42:53.874 --> 42:55.475
What event?

42:55.553 --> 42:58.186
A cleansing fire

42:58.288 --> 43:02.190
that will destroy, purify,

43:02.292 --> 43:05.793
create... create you, Bruce.

43:05.895 --> 43:08.596
Because I will use it as a mighty forge,

43:08.698 --> 43:10.164
molding you into

43:10.266 --> 43:13.321
a dark knight of Gotham.

43:21.445 --> 43:24.093
If it doesn't kill you, that is.
