<i>"I'd like to fry her eyeballs.</i>

00:22.397 --> 00:25.400
If no one else steps up
to kill the president, I will.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.027
I'd enjoy it."

00:27.861 --> 00:29.446
A tweet out of North Dakota.

00:29.738 --> 00:30.738
What else?

00:32.281 --> 00:35.160
"God never intended a woman
to rule this land.

00:35.243 --> 00:36.995
She is the anti-Christ.

00:37.829 --> 00:39.873
- And a Jew."
- A Jew?

00:40.165 --> 00:42.751
- Do we really need to hear all of this?
- Yes.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.962
An unpublished editorial.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.548
Someone pointing a gun at your likeness.

00:48.631 --> 00:51.426
Lots of other online stuff, including a...

00:52.677 --> 00:53.803
contest...

00:54.429 --> 00:55.429
For?

00:56.181 --> 00:58.224
For the most creative way to kill you.

00:59.434 --> 01:00.435
And the winner?

01:01.519 --> 01:02.645
Rather not say, ma'am.

01:03.772 --> 01:06.649
I want to hear.
Just hand me the report, Rick.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.488
It involves, essentially, skinning you.

01:12.822 --> 01:14.824
Cutting your body into dozens of pieces

01:14.908 --> 01:17.118
and arranging them
in the shape of the American flag.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.665
Flesh for the white stripes,
blood for the red.

01:24.959 --> 01:25.959
What else?

01:26.920 --> 01:29.756
Lot of threats
involving the C-word, ma'am.

01:29.839 --> 01:31.966
Lots and lots of the C-word,
unfortunately.

01:34.010 --> 01:35.370
You mean Claire? It's a long list.

01:37.639 --> 01:40.850
- If you really want me to, I'll...
- Listen, I am not the first president

01:40.934 --> 01:41.976
to face threats.

01:42.060 --> 01:44.646
I know with Francis,
sometimes there were several a day.

01:44.729 --> 01:45.939
Is it about the same

01:46.397 --> 01:47.857
what we're dealing with here?

01:48.900 --> 01:50.276
It's...

01:50.485 --> 01:51.903
significantly up.

01:51.986 --> 01:52.821
By how much?

01:52.904 --> 01:54.948
There are roughly
four times as many threats

01:55.031 --> 01:56.950
on any given day since you took office.

01:57.033 --> 01:59.577
Now it's twice that since Francis died.

02:01.538 --> 02:03.581
I thought everyone loves a widow.

02:03.665 --> 02:06.084
Not if she's also
Commander-in-Chief, I guess.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.216
These are not rational people,
Madam President.

02:08.252 --> 02:10.839
But, ma'am, as far as today's threat,

02:10.922 --> 02:12.608
regarding your first
scheduled appearance...

02:12.632 --> 02:14.092
We're canceling the appearance.

02:16.427 --> 02:17.804
We're not canceling.

02:18.847 --> 02:19.889
It's a military base.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.517
That's got to be the safest place on Earth
for a president.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.353
An anonymous soldier
has made a serious threat...

02:25.436 --> 02:28.231
"To shoot me in the cunt on behalf
of the United States of America."

02:28.314 --> 02:30.400
Yes, Mark, I heard.
The threat's unconfirmed.

02:30.483 --> 02:32.203
He says he's among
those shipping out today.

02:32.235 --> 02:34.296
- Anyone can claim that.
- And that you have no right

02:34.320 --> 02:36.698
waging war in Syria. You, in particular.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.867
I think we stay away.
Rick, don't you agree?

02:38.950 --> 02:41.494
There's no proof the threat is credible.
Isn't that right, Rick?

02:41.578 --> 02:43.705
Our intelligence division
is investigating,

02:43.788 --> 02:46.624
and the advance team is already there,
but it'll take at least a day

02:46.708 --> 02:48.334
to comb through that base.

02:48.418 --> 02:51.462
I think what the vice president says
is the best course.

02:51.546 --> 02:55.091
- Maybe by tomorrow you could...
- Tomorrow is the fifth of July.

02:56.926 --> 02:59.512
- Yes, ma'am.
- So what do you suggest I do?

02:59.596 --> 03:03.057
- Wish the nation a happy belated birthday?
- Our only concern is your safety...

03:03.141 --> 03:04.434
We're not cancelling.

03:05.143 --> 03:07.687
I am sending those soldiers
onto a battlefield.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.815
The first female president
of the United States

03:10.899 --> 03:14.027
is not gonna keep her mouth shut
on the Fourth of fucking July.

04:54.377 --> 04:56.462
Lieutenant General Gallagher
would understand.

04:57.046 --> 05:00.008
- I could appear instead. Speak for you.
- Stop.

05:03.761 --> 05:06.431
Is it my safety that concerns you,

05:06.514 --> 05:08.725
or my potential endorsement of Gallagher?

05:08.808 --> 05:10.435
Your safety first, of course.

05:10.977 --> 05:13.563
But singling her out,
that's a provocation.

05:13.646 --> 05:14.897
And so?

05:15.523 --> 05:16.941
I can't provoke them?

05:17.025 --> 05:19.444
You're forwarding a candidate
the Shepherds are against,

05:19.527 --> 05:20.820
in their home state.

05:21.612 --> 05:24.699
- After months of negotiation.
- This is not a negotiation,

05:24.782 --> 05:27.327
this is an ultimatum.
Sign the bill or what?

05:27.410 --> 05:28.786
Or what, Mark?

05:32.123 --> 05:34.584
When Francis was looking
to finance his foundation,

05:34.667 --> 05:37.170
why did you point him
towards Bill and Annette?

05:37.253 --> 05:39.422
I didn't. Raymond Tusk arranged it.

05:39.505 --> 05:41.215
Or maybe they reached out to him?

05:42.425 --> 05:43.551
I don't remember.

05:44.218 --> 05:47.180
I... What does it matter?
They're working with you now.

05:48.973 --> 05:51.476
I need to meet
with the Shepherds directly.

05:51.559 --> 05:52.435
Madam President.

05:52.518 --> 05:54.437
I'll see them before my appearance
at the base.

05:54.520 --> 05:55.897
- You can't.
- I what?

05:58.274 --> 05:59.942
I'll let them know.

06:01.527 --> 06:02.527
Thank you.

06:07.784 --> 06:11.621
You're due at the base by 4:45,
which will have you back here by 8:30.

06:11.913 --> 06:14.123
The fireworks show
begins right after nine.

06:14.207 --> 06:18.086
And the <i>Examiner</i> would love your okay
on the photos.

06:33.434 --> 06:36.062
Is there any progress
on the source of the sound?

06:36.145 --> 06:37.897
The GSA is still looking into it.

06:37.980 --> 06:40.584
They're checking the floorboards
above and below, in case there's...

06:40.608 --> 06:42.318
I don't want to wait anymore.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.362
Please tell the executive housekeeper

06:44.445 --> 06:46.906
I'd like the former president's belongings
packed up.

06:46.989 --> 06:48.366
I'll have it taken care of.

09:05.628 --> 09:08.381
It's not true what he told you
all those years ago.

09:09.340 --> 09:12.468
That there are two kinds,
useful and useless.

09:13.261 --> 09:14.679
There's only one kind.

09:15.471 --> 09:17.306
Pain is pain.

09:27.149 --> 09:28.192
Francis...

09:29.986 --> 09:31.195
I'm done with you.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.040
There.

09:44.584 --> 09:45.585
No more pain.

09:54.218 --> 09:55.845
You do this all day?

09:58.431 --> 10:01.851
I'm under psychiatric observation, Seth.
This is what you do.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.857
Who's your new tailor?

10:09.317 --> 10:10.526
You gotta look the part.

10:12.820 --> 10:14.155
So, when do they decide

10:14.739 --> 10:16.115
whether you're crazy or not?

10:17.366 --> 10:18.659
Because if you're not,

10:19.285 --> 10:20.703
you should come work for us.

10:21.537 --> 10:22.537
Us?

10:24.707 --> 10:26.834
Have you been working there
for about five minutes?

10:26.959 --> 10:28.252
It's been a month, actually.

10:30.671 --> 10:32.298
So his body wasn't even cold.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.872
It's what he would have wanted.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.069
The Underwood Foundation
was basically gonna be modeled

10:36.093 --> 10:37.613
after the Shepherd Freedom Foundation.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.347
I don't need the job.

10:39.889 --> 10:44.018
Oh. Well, for a confessed murderer,
you're pretty confident.

10:44.935 --> 10:46.354
I'm about to be pardoned.

10:46.896 --> 10:47.896
Pardon?

10:49.398 --> 10:51.238
You really think
that she's gonna give you one?

10:51.275 --> 10:54.570
As usual, you don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.865
You know, there wasn't the kind of crowd
that you'd expect for him

10:57.948 --> 10:59.075
down there in Gaffney.

10:59.158 --> 11:00.701
He wanted to be buried in Arlington.

11:01.494 --> 11:02.828
Not next to his father.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.413
That's not what his wife said.

11:08.668 --> 11:09.710
Tell me something.

11:11.212 --> 11:12.630
She even shed a tear?

11:13.673 --> 11:14.674
You know...

11:15.633 --> 11:17.843
I'm almost envious, to tell you the truth.

11:19.261 --> 11:21.138
That even beyond the grave,

11:22.014 --> 11:24.141
you'd do anything for Francis Underwood.

11:29.980 --> 11:32.191
Doug, do you have my lighter?

11:38.364 --> 11:39.657
Much obliged.

11:45.246 --> 11:46.580
Was that who I thought it was?

11:47.123 --> 11:49.625
Fred Amburg? He went off the deep end?

11:50.042 --> 11:51.627
Everyone has problems, Seth.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.463
Especially the ones who think they don't.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.650
- Claire.
- Annette.

12:15.651 --> 12:17.945
Oh, did you get my note?

12:18.112 --> 12:21.115
Oh, I haven't had the courage
to read the condolences yet.

12:22.116 --> 12:25.244
It's good to see you finally out
and about.

12:25.619 --> 12:27.288
Oh, what you've been through.

12:29.331 --> 12:30.791
You know all about it.

12:31.375 --> 12:34.503
Well, for a long time,
I pretended he was still alive.

12:35.337 --> 12:36.756
Out of town.

12:36.839 --> 12:39.049
It was our son Duncan
that really saved me.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.553
Of course, we weren't married
anywhere near as long as you and Frank.

12:43.220 --> 12:44.220
Claire Hale.

12:45.598 --> 12:46.807
Nine years.

12:47.641 --> 12:49.059
Late spring,

12:49.935 --> 12:51.103
Sun Valley.

12:54.315 --> 12:55.816
You look exactly the same.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.027
Well, it's cities that age you,

12:58.444 --> 13:00.029
it's what I tell everyone.

13:02.323 --> 13:06.118
I hope you don't mind saying hello
to a few of our closest friends.

13:07.369 --> 13:10.247
They're just here for a cocktail
before the...

13:10.331 --> 13:13.292
the sun goes down
and the rest of the party shows up.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.962
My sister's fireworks show have become
a bit of a tradition.

13:20.841 --> 13:23.511
Don't worry. They know how to be discreet.

13:28.849 --> 13:31.769
Scotty here just got his hands
on Nexis Security.

13:31.852 --> 13:34.230
I heard you are speaking
to the vice president about this.

13:34.313 --> 13:36.023
It's a company of peacekeepers, mostly.

13:36.106 --> 13:39.318
Oh, tremendous potential
to create global partnerships.

13:39.401 --> 13:42.530
Your husband helped me secure the deal.
I wanted to bring him onto the Board.

13:43.447 --> 13:44.448
Bill was saying...

13:44.532 --> 13:46.033
Yes, I was just saying.

13:46.116 --> 13:50.704
Why in the world do they play
the "1812 Overture" at a fireworks show?

13:50.996 --> 13:53.541
It's Russian, for Chrissakes,
in every sense.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.293
This is Tabitha.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.128
Oh. Peters, I know.

13:59.338 --> 14:00.338
Frank...

14:01.006 --> 14:03.551
- Wasn't he planning to be here today?
- He was.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.344
You must miss him terribly.

14:06.428 --> 14:09.139
I had some long
and hard-fought conversations with him.

14:09.223 --> 14:12.726
He was going to help me resolve this
AFL-CIO thing

14:12.810 --> 14:14.770
that's been going on forever
out in Nevada,

14:14.854 --> 14:16.605
with your help, of course.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.275
When the union stands
in the way of innovation,

14:19.358 --> 14:21.277
it's sentencing itself to death.

14:22.611 --> 14:25.322
I do admire the way you hang on
to your party.

14:25.406 --> 14:26.699
Your loyalty.

14:28.033 --> 14:30.327
Did I hear that
Lieutenant General Nancy Gallagher

14:30.411 --> 14:32.246
will be appearing with you later today?

14:36.333 --> 14:38.460
I think she'd make an excellent candidate,

14:38.544 --> 14:40.921
if she decides to run, of course.

14:41.005 --> 14:43.173
Oh, she's going to run.

14:48.095 --> 14:50.598
The president is on a tight schedule.

14:58.022 --> 14:59.023
Excuse me.

15:16.123 --> 15:18.000
Well, this is a surprise.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.921
You know how Midwesterners
feel about those.

15:22.004 --> 15:25.132
Oh, don't listen to him.
It's about time you came out.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.635
Seems we have some things to discuss.

15:27.968 --> 15:28.886
Yeah.

15:28.969 --> 15:32.222
Well, as far as this special election
is concerned, Claire,

15:32.306 --> 15:35.517
you need to know that
the soon-to-be-retiring Miss Gallagher

15:36.393 --> 15:37.645
is out of question.

15:38.145 --> 15:42.650
And I'm happy to see we're both fans
of the Declaration of Independence,

15:42.733 --> 15:44.318
unalienable rights and all that.

15:44.401 --> 15:46.904
But it says down here in the speech
you're gonna give later...

15:46.987 --> 15:48.822
Miss Gallagher has my support.

15:50.824 --> 15:52.660
I believe Mark conveyed our concerns.

15:53.077 --> 15:54.828
And communicated mine, I hope.

15:55.579 --> 15:58.666
She's a tax and spend Democrat
underneath that uniform.

15:58.749 --> 16:01.377
- A patriot with a pristine resume.
- Claire.

16:01.460 --> 16:04.296
Who is very vocal about keeping
private contractors away

16:04.380 --> 16:06.775
- from US military operations.
- Even as a negotiating point,

16:06.799 --> 16:07.879
you can do better than her.

16:07.925 --> 16:10.094
And I am tired of these delays,
Madam President.

16:10.177 --> 16:11.595
It is time for you to deliver.

16:15.015 --> 16:17.559
- Your husband and I had an agreement.
- Francis is dead.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.937
- Promises were made.
- Not by me.

16:22.147 --> 16:26.026
Just like you, I like to negotiate
my own agreements.

16:26.527 --> 16:29.613
And make no mistake about it,
the lieutenant general is not an anomaly.

16:29.697 --> 16:32.741
I know that. I've seen your list
of candidates for the midterms...

16:32.825 --> 16:35.911
- Yes, mostly women.
- I don't care what sex they are.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.622
And for the record,
nobody loves women more than me.

16:38.706 --> 16:41.083
But this slate of yours,
it will bankrupt the country.

16:41.166 --> 16:44.044
They will set us back a generation.
They will completely...

16:44.128 --> 16:47.297
Support me and what I stand for.

16:47.673 --> 16:48.590
And what is that?

16:48.674 --> 16:50.342
- Oh, come on, Bill.
- No, no. Tell me.

16:50.426 --> 16:52.011
I wanna know. What's your mission?

16:52.094 --> 16:54.263
- I wanna know what your platform is.
- Oh, please.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.557
I know you'd like
to drown DC all at once.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.101
But I'm gonna tell you right now,
I cannot let that happen.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.562
I still believe in government
and its ability

17:01.645 --> 17:04.397
to make the everyday lives
of its citizens better.

17:04.481 --> 17:06.442
- Yeah.
- You don't wanna support my slate,

17:06.525 --> 17:07.525
that's fine.

17:08.193 --> 17:11.155
- Claire...
- All I ask is stay out of the way.

17:14.491 --> 17:16.535
There's a bill sitting on your desk.

17:18.162 --> 17:20.122
A bill that took years...

17:20.580 --> 17:23.208
and money to get passed.

17:23.459 --> 17:24.792
You sign that,

17:25.544 --> 17:27.838
and I know I got a friend
in the White House.

17:29.381 --> 17:30.549
If not...

17:32.301 --> 17:33.886
- Then I don't.
- Enough.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.391
Nothing good happens to you
when she's around.

17:39.475 --> 17:40.476
Nothing.

17:41.435 --> 17:43.145
Why did you come out for Francis?

17:43.812 --> 17:45.105
For his foundation?

17:45.189 --> 17:47.232
I don't think you ever really liked him.

17:48.317 --> 17:51.695
Probably never respected him.
Why back him now?

17:53.572 --> 17:55.199
Because he gave us you.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.747
Tell our friends I'll be back down
in time for the fireworks.

18:10.297 --> 18:13.342
Just so you know, I always liked Frank.

18:15.677 --> 18:17.137
His desperation.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.060
I'm sorry you can't stay.

18:23.685 --> 18:26.146
I do enjoy curating our little show.

18:27.356 --> 18:30.275
I collect a variety of fireworks shells
as I travel.

18:30.859 --> 18:32.653
Italy, Spain, China.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.949
Do you know what the hardest color
to make is?

18:39.201 --> 18:41.328
- Red?
- No, red's easy.

18:41.745 --> 18:42.955
White's easy.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.249
It's blue.

18:45.582 --> 18:48.418
Very tricky chemistry
involving copper and heat.

18:48.836 --> 18:51.463
A truly bright blue is extremely elusive.

18:53.757 --> 18:56.468
Whatever Francis promised or did...

18:57.594 --> 18:59.054
is buried with him.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.223
No, I know.

19:02.891 --> 19:04.977
We all need to let him go.

19:05.894 --> 19:08.230
Start from some kind of scratch.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.276
Though it must haunt you,

19:13.652 --> 19:15.821
the fact that he died next to you in bed.

19:23.495 --> 19:24.496
Hon...

19:27.207 --> 19:28.250
be patient.

19:33.213 --> 19:35.900
- She doesn't like the name?
- I think she finds it incomplete.

19:35.924 --> 19:37.569
What's wrong with
the Comprehensive Safety Act?

19:37.593 --> 19:39.112
Comprehensive Chemical Safety Act?

19:39.136 --> 19:41.030
Or we could go back
to the Smarter Safety Act.

19:41.054 --> 19:44.057
- Would she like "Smarter" better?
- No, we need a good acronym.

19:44.141 --> 19:46.268
Mr. Vice President? Mark?

19:48.729 --> 19:49.729
Yeah. Agreed.

19:50.189 --> 19:53.901
At one point, we talked about
the Repeal Unsafe Regulation Act.

19:53.984 --> 19:55.736
That's RURAL if we come up with an L.

19:55.819 --> 19:56.737
Legislation?

19:56.820 --> 19:58.464
That doesn't make sense
with the rest of it.

19:58.488 --> 20:00.741
"RURAL" is too hard to say.
"SAFE" is good.

20:00.824 --> 20:02.409
Safety. Future.

20:02.492 --> 20:06.705
- I like "FUTURE."
- Federal Universal Toxic and Unsafe...

20:07.122 --> 20:09.041
- Regulation Eradication.
- Okay.

20:09.666 --> 20:11.793
- The FUTURE Act.
- That could work.

20:12.377 --> 20:16.632
May I ask, Mr. Vice President,
does her hesitation go beyond the name?

20:18.300 --> 20:20.427
She'll come around. I'm guessing...

20:21.637 --> 20:23.198
by the end of the day.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.765
Because in one form or another,

20:24.848 --> 20:27.448
- this bill has been on her desk since...
- She'll sign it, Henry.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.062
Bill.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.400
What do you want me to do?

20:35.484 --> 20:37.444
Yank her from her own military base?

20:41.490 --> 20:45.702
When, in the course of human events,
it becomes necessary

20:45.786 --> 20:48.538
for one people
to dissolve the political bands

20:48.622 --> 20:50.249
which have connected them with another,

20:50.707 --> 20:52.542
you just have to do it.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.003
Sever the relationship.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.340
Our nation's founding document,

20:58.423 --> 21:00.425
the Declaration of Independence...

21:00.509 --> 21:01.927
America's independence...

21:02.010 --> 21:04.721
was hard-fought and hard-won.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.556
Are you still there?

21:06.640 --> 21:10.727
Our Founding Fathers
imagined a nation that was free.

21:11.436 --> 21:12.980
Free from despotism.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.565
Free from absolute tyranny.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.318
Free from an oppressive king.

21:18.735 --> 21:19.903
Do you miss Francis?

21:19.987 --> 21:21.989
Tyrants come in many forms.

21:23.073 --> 21:27.536
From the American oligarchs trying
to change the very fabric of our society,

21:28.537 --> 21:30.998
to autocrats threatening from abroad.

21:32.165 --> 21:36.795
Now, each one of us
has to defend our destiny.

21:37.838 --> 21:39.256
And as I see it,

21:39.339 --> 21:43.969
the fight against tyranny
is the only justification for war.

21:45.512 --> 21:49.683
My first 100 days as president
have been difficult.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.477
I lost my husband.

21:53.687 --> 21:56.315
We were about
to celebrate 30 years together.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.318
But I know what he would want.

21:59.818 --> 22:02.696
For me to stop mourning and carry on.

22:03.780 --> 22:07.034
With the help of women like
Lieutenant General Nancy Gallagher,

22:07.117 --> 22:09.494
my presidency will not rest.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.414
Nancy has been an inspiration to me.

22:12.956 --> 22:14.750
A tireless warrior.

22:14.833 --> 22:18.795
I promise her and all of you
that I will work on behalf of the rights

22:18.879 --> 22:22.758
and freedoms earned over the last
241 years of our democracy.

22:24.801 --> 22:26.553
As I look into the eyes

22:26.636 --> 22:29.348
of you brave soldiers
standing before me today...

22:29.431 --> 22:30.349
Here's the thing.

22:30.432 --> 22:32.476
I'm feeling so proud right now.

22:33.018 --> 22:34.936
Proud to be your Commander-in-Chief.

22:35.228 --> 22:37.814
Whatever Francis told you
the last five years,

22:37.898 --> 22:39.274
don't believe a word of it.

22:39.358 --> 22:42.569
Our country is 241 years old, my friends.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.655
Let's wish this great nation
a happy birthday.

22:45.739 --> 22:46.948
Say it with me.

22:47.032 --> 22:49.368
Happy birthday, America!

22:49.451 --> 22:52.204
Happy Birthday, America!

22:52.287 --> 22:53.806
It's going to be different for you and me.

22:53.830 --> 22:54.915
<i>One more time.</i>

22:54.998 --> 22:56.291
I'm going to tell you the truth.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.835
Happy Birthday, America.

23:00.337 --> 23:01.977
- Thank you for your service.
- Thank you.

23:03.006 --> 23:04.466
Thank you for your service.

23:05.550 --> 23:07.469
- Thank you for your service.
- Thank you.

23:09.346 --> 23:12.349
I want you to know how wonderful it is
to be here and meet

23:12.432 --> 23:14.017
all of you new recruits.

23:14.101 --> 23:15.310
So, thank you.

23:15.644 --> 23:16.937
Thank you for your service.

23:17.020 --> 23:18.605
- Thank you.
- Thank you, ma'am.

23:18.939 --> 23:21.441
Thank you for your service.
Where are you from, private?

23:21.525 --> 23:23.026
Kalamazoo, Mr. President.

23:24.152 --> 23:26.312
- Excuse me, Madam President.
- That's quite all right.

23:26.655 --> 23:28.198
I actually hate "Madam."

23:28.281 --> 23:30.742
Makes me sound like I'm running a brothel
and not a country.

23:30.826 --> 23:33.471
- Thank you for your service.
- Thank you, Madam President.

23:33.495 --> 23:35.038
Thank you for your service.

23:35.122 --> 23:36.790
And where are you from, Pvt. Burton?

23:36.873 --> 23:38.125
South Bend, ma'am.

23:38.208 --> 23:40.085
Oh, I love Indiana.

23:40.502 --> 23:42.504
I enlisted right before you took office.

23:42.587 --> 23:45.507
Well, I promise you
and every woman in this country

23:45.590 --> 23:47.008
that during my presidency

23:47.092 --> 23:49.386
the key components
of the Equal Rights Amendment

23:49.845 --> 23:51.388
will finally pass.

23:51.471 --> 23:53.098
I'm going to make sure of it.

23:53.807 --> 23:55.600
I want you to know I support you.

23:56.601 --> 23:58.270
Do you even have a plan?

23:59.187 --> 24:00.230
What did you say?

24:01.815 --> 24:03.817
One that won't get us all killed?

24:04.234 --> 24:05.485
Oh, man...

24:06.778 --> 24:09.072
Would you have asked me that
if I were a man?

24:18.707 --> 24:19.791
Madam President!

24:21.126 --> 24:24.212
One question, please!

25:33.907 --> 25:36.993
How much longer till we get to the plane?

25:37.077 --> 25:39.579
Just another 25 minutes or so,
Madam President.

25:39.913 --> 25:41.623
Okay, thank you.

25:41.706 --> 25:43.041
Shit!

25:44.459 --> 25:46.499
- Is she shot?
- Stay down, stay down!

25:46.920 --> 25:48.964
Shots fired! Shots fired!

25:49.047 --> 25:51.287
Are you okay, Madam President?
- Are you all right? - Yes.

25:53.093 --> 25:54.302
Lone Star is safe.

26:16.366 --> 26:19.127
Sir, someone just tried
to kill the president.

26:23.039 --> 26:24.708
I just got the alert. Is she all right?

26:25.250 --> 26:26.250
This way.

26:42.517 --> 26:43.560
Lincoln,

26:45.061 --> 26:48.481
Garfield, McKinley, Kennedy.

26:49.816 --> 26:52.193
Successful assassinations, total of four.

26:56.239 --> 26:58.908
The attempts... Nine?

27:00.243 --> 27:03.246
Jackson, both Roosevelts.

27:04.706 --> 27:06.750
Truman. Ford twice.

27:07.459 --> 27:08.501
Reagan...

27:09.919 --> 27:12.005
the first Underwood and...

27:14.507 --> 27:17.510
I will say, whoever tried to kill me,

27:18.303 --> 27:23.099
perversely, it's the first sign
of real respect I've gotten in 100 days.

27:33.026 --> 27:34.444
Somebody tried to kill her.

27:36.738 --> 27:37.738
Bill.

27:40.325 --> 27:41.493
Can you blame them?

27:43.703 --> 27:45.955
The Underwoods
have always been hard of hearing.

27:47.040 --> 27:48.750
She's not him.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.251
No, no.

27:50.335 --> 27:51.586
She is not.

27:51.878 --> 27:53.963
<i>You </i> know that better than anyone.

27:56.341 --> 27:57.634
Is it public?

27:58.385 --> 28:01.471
Secret Service shut it down.
Standard procedure, apparently.

28:01.554 --> 28:03.848
Threats beget threats.

28:05.433 --> 28:06.433
Bill...

28:07.352 --> 28:08.853
were you behind this?

28:12.399 --> 28:13.650
We're gonna miss the show.

28:22.367 --> 28:24.619
- How are y'all?
- Madam President.

28:24.703 --> 28:25.703
Hi, I'm so sorry.

28:25.745 --> 28:27.580
I want to apologize
for the late departure.

28:27.664 --> 28:30.667
I know you all have families
and festivities waiting.

28:30.750 --> 28:34.087
Madam President,
may I ask what happened?

28:34.379 --> 28:39.050
Oh, the Beast was re-routed due
to security concerns. Pretty routine.

28:39.551 --> 28:43.138
I know it's been a while
since I've been back here.

28:43.221 --> 28:45.849
I just wanted to wish you all
a very happy Fourth,

28:45.932 --> 28:49.602
even if you're gonna be celebrating it
on the fifth. I'm so sorry.

28:49.686 --> 28:52.188
Your speech, afterwards with...

28:52.272 --> 28:54.023
Yes, the new recruit.

28:54.941 --> 28:58.486
If a new recruit, especially a female one,
can't speak her mind,

28:58.570 --> 29:01.781
I don't know what kind of country
we actually are.

29:05.910 --> 29:07.954
And be sure to tell us
if you run out of beer.

29:08.037 --> 29:10.248
Because I am sure
there's a couple of cases left over

29:10.331 --> 29:12.876
from the Carter administration.

29:13.710 --> 29:14.878
And you're new.

29:16.212 --> 29:19.299
Yes, ma'am. Melody Cruz.
I'm with Beltway Television.

29:19.799 --> 29:21.885
Well, I hope everyone
is making you feel at home.

29:22.343 --> 29:23.261
Very much so.

29:23.344 --> 29:25.096
It's an honor to finally meet you.

29:25.638 --> 29:26.973
I'm a bit overwhelmed, sorry.

29:27.056 --> 29:29.726
- Don't worry, I don't bite.
- No, I know.

29:31.144 --> 29:34.773
It's strange, I was supposed
to interview your husband.

29:35.732 --> 29:37.984
It was scheduled for a few days
after he died.

29:39.152 --> 29:42.655
It was going to be an exclusive.
We'd had a number of pre-interviews.

29:42.989 --> 29:44.657
Questions we'd agreed on.

29:46.201 --> 29:47.285
Questions like?

29:48.870 --> 29:51.790
Like, was the president
going to pardon him?

29:52.707 --> 29:53.750
And when?

29:54.501 --> 29:56.753
Will you? Even now, posthumously?

30:00.089 --> 30:03.176
I know you did an exclusive
with <i>The New York Examiner,</i>

30:03.259 --> 30:06.596
butI'm guessing that's only
going to scratch the surface.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.015
I bet you have more to say

30:10.016 --> 30:11.856
- about the state of your marriage...
- Miss...

30:12.101 --> 30:13.186
Cruz, is it?

30:13.394 --> 30:15.021
I don't know if anyone's told you,

30:15.104 --> 30:17.184
but when the president visits
this part of the plane,

30:17.232 --> 30:18.792
it's usually considered off the record.

30:19.692 --> 30:21.462
But you can ask my press secretary
anything you like

30:21.486 --> 30:22.686
once we're back on the ground.

30:33.581 --> 30:35.500
You're especially quiet this evening.

30:37.126 --> 30:38.711
Maybe I'm a little agitated.

30:43.591 --> 30:46.845
Our patients don't do too well
when it comes to fireworks.

30:46.928 --> 30:48.847
Ah. Pardon me.

30:56.145 --> 30:57.145
Yes?

30:57.480 --> 31:00.108
I don't understand why you leave that on
when we're meeting.

31:00.817 --> 31:04.237
Well, it's not like you're saying
anything different or new.

31:04.696 --> 31:07.115
Your dedication to your script
would be admirable

31:07.198 --> 31:09.033
if it weren't so concerning.

31:12.412 --> 31:14.664
In a few weeks,
I'll be appearing at a hearing

31:15.123 --> 31:17.166
regarding your state of mind

31:18.251 --> 31:20.253
and when it comes to your confession,

31:20.753 --> 31:23.715
even a guilty man
changes his story now and then.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.220
Who do you answer to?

31:30.597 --> 31:32.015
I mean, who do you work for?

31:33.683 --> 31:35.310
You.

31:37.145 --> 31:38.855
That's the idea, anyway.

31:40.398 --> 31:42.191
Everybody works for somebody.

31:48.573 --> 31:50.950
I worked for a man who refused to fail.

31:53.202 --> 31:54.662
I respected that.

31:55.830 --> 31:57.206
I appreciated it.

32:02.795 --> 32:04.130
I'd be dead without him.

32:05.131 --> 32:06.131
Why?

32:17.393 --> 32:20.563
I was working as an aide
for a congressman.

32:21.356 --> 32:23.191
He was idealistic and naive.

32:23.650 --> 32:25.568
Had one-term written all over him.

32:27.236 --> 32:30.615
But I needed a job, a place to be.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.952
I was barely keeping it together.

32:37.956 --> 32:40.041
Francis and I met at some function.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.669
You know, the kind you stand up at.

32:46.506 --> 32:49.884
I don't know how he knew,
but I had eight bottles in my trunk.

32:51.052 --> 32:53.172
I got through four that night
when he came to my door.

32:55.682 --> 32:57.016
I don't remember much.

32:58.184 --> 32:59.352
Not clearly.

33:03.147 --> 33:04.399
He took me to his home.

33:06.192 --> 33:07.360
But Claire...

33:11.155 --> 33:12.615
Francis got me dry.

33:14.951 --> 33:17.412
I shook so badly
I thought I was gonna die.

33:20.123 --> 33:22.041
And then when I was finally got clean,

33:23.084 --> 33:24.752
he gave me my first job.

33:27.088 --> 33:28.131
As an aide?

33:30.133 --> 33:31.718
Hmm. Sort of.

33:33.386 --> 33:36.180
He asked me to go talk
to Congressman Kyle from Iowa.

33:36.973 --> 33:37.973
To what end?

33:40.018 --> 33:41.269
To persuade him.

33:44.105 --> 33:45.273
And I did.

33:51.404 --> 33:52.488
But Claire...

33:54.365 --> 33:55.950
The way she treated him,

33:58.369 --> 33:59.871
in life and in death...

34:08.588 --> 34:11.132
But you pay a price,
when you work for somebody like him.

34:12.216 --> 34:13.426
Somebody you owe.

34:22.310 --> 34:24.603
Somebody close to me died
in a car accident.

34:28.149 --> 34:30.234
That's how I broke the terms
of my house arrest.

34:33.487 --> 34:35.197
I went to see the site of her wreck.

34:37.074 --> 34:39.159
It was twisted on the side of the road.

34:43.371 --> 34:44.748
I just stood there.

34:46.458 --> 34:47.585
An accident?

34:50.588 --> 34:51.839
So they said.

34:54.550 --> 34:55.927
And Zoe Barnes?

34:59.263 --> 35:00.348
I killed her.

35:02.433 --> 35:03.726
For the president.

35:14.862 --> 35:16.572
That's what he used to do when he won.

35:20.409 --> 35:23.204
What did he leave you with?

35:30.920 --> 35:35.299
Last thing that Francis gave me
was the letter opener from his desk.

35:37.343 --> 35:38.845
I mean, I chose it, but...

35:42.974 --> 35:45.935
But I guess really the last thing
he gave me was an apology.

35:48.229 --> 35:50.106
I spoke to him the night he died.

37:22.740 --> 37:25.243
<i>My presidency will not rest.</i>

37:25.910 --> 37:29.705
<i>Nancy has been an inspiration to me.
A tireless warrior.</i>

37:29.789 --> 37:33.542
<i>I promise her and all of you
that I will work on behalf of the rights</i>

37:33.626 --> 37:37.672
<i>and freedoms earned
over the last 241 years of our democracy.</i>

37:38.547 --> 37:40.299
<i>Tyrants come in many forms...</i>

37:40.383 --> 37:41.259
Pathetic.

37:41.342 --> 37:44.011
<i>From the American oligarchs trying
to change the very...</i>

37:52.895 --> 37:55.898
Are you sure you don't want
to take an hour or two to...

37:55.982 --> 37:58.359
Mark. I'm inside the White House.

37:58.442 --> 38:00.945
There's only two of us in the Oval,
so unless you're packing,

38:01.028 --> 38:04.490
- it's literally the safest place I can be.
- Well, I'm not packing, Madam President,

38:04.573 --> 38:07.702
but no one would fault you
for taking a breath for a minute.

38:09.495 --> 38:10.955
I'm breathing just fine.

38:12.248 --> 38:14.208
Can we keep news of this contained?

38:14.917 --> 38:17.753
- I've taken every possible step, I think.
- So who is he?

38:19.213 --> 38:22.258
Well, they did forensics on the route.

38:22.341 --> 38:24.552
Compared notes with the aerial detail.

38:25.428 --> 38:28.055
Homeland Secretary and the Bureau
were brought in.

38:28.848 --> 38:32.101
He never left the place
he took the shot from.

38:37.648 --> 38:40.568
Can you answer a single question directly
and simply?

38:43.362 --> 38:47.992
He shot himself in the head
with his own US military-issued handgun.

38:50.202 --> 38:51.620
And we're sure he's the one?

38:51.704 --> 38:53.789
Yeah. Pro-militia. Anti-government.

38:54.498 --> 38:57.209
Dishonorably discharged last year.
All the typical markers.

38:57.293 --> 38:59.045
Secret Service is confident.

38:59.503 --> 39:01.088
And the Bureau's investigating.

39:04.383 --> 39:07.011
How did Bill Shepherd get his hands
on my speech?

39:08.429 --> 39:09.680
What? Um...

39:09.805 --> 39:12.975
Well, the press usually gets it
hours before.

39:13.059 --> 39:15.269
It wouldn't be that hard
to access a copy, I guess.

39:18.731 --> 39:20.274
I won't be signing that today.

39:25.446 --> 39:28.324
You went there to declare
your independence, and you declared war.

39:28.407 --> 39:29.325
That was a mistake.

39:29.408 --> 39:31.303
No, the mistake was I didn't hire
a chief of staff,

39:31.327 --> 39:33.007
and things are slipping
through the cracks.

39:33.079 --> 39:36.079
That's where I have to disagree with you.
We need to keep this circle small.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.460
You know, Francis warned me about you.

39:44.006 --> 39:46.801
I assure you, I serve at your pleasure,
Madam President.

39:47.301 --> 39:50.179
You need to stop meeting in my office
without me.

39:54.016 --> 39:55.016
Yes, ma'am.

40:03.943 --> 40:06.704
Secret Service took the lead. But do you believe the theory?

40:07.780 --> 40:11.534
That it was a disgruntled service person
who took a shot at me?

40:11.784 --> 40:12.952
PID does.

40:14.662 --> 40:16.163
I'm asking what you think.

40:18.541 --> 40:23.129
It depends if it was a warning
or an actual attempt.

40:24.255 --> 40:27.842
Given the accuracy, the shooter
would have been informed enough to know

40:27.925 --> 40:30.803
that a .50 caliber round
wouldn't penetrate the Beast.

40:32.346 --> 40:33.681
I think he wanted to scare you.

40:34.306 --> 40:35.766
On behalf of someone.

40:35.850 --> 40:38.394
Lots of people make threats
against sitting presidents.

40:38.477 --> 40:41.188
I'm starting to believe
Francis was murdered.

40:46.026 --> 40:49.738
Before he died, he aligned himself
with some very powerful people.

40:49.822 --> 40:51.883
And I think they turned on him,
and they wanted him dead,

40:51.907 --> 40:53.784
and I think they want me dead, too.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.788
Do you think that sounds crazy?

40:59.915 --> 41:00.916
No, ma'am.

41:01.709 --> 41:04.128
But I think we need to bring in
Special Agent Bowman...

41:04.211 --> 41:06.505
Of these people, these powerful families,

41:06.589 --> 41:10.050
they advocate
dismantling intelligence agencies.

41:10.301 --> 41:12.303
CIA, FBI, Homeland.

41:12.553 --> 41:13.553
You know that, right?

41:13.596 --> 41:15.347
- Ma'am...
- We cannot bring

41:15.431 --> 41:17.475
anyone else in at the moment.

41:19.143 --> 41:20.686
I'm relying on you

41:21.520 --> 41:23.397
the way I know my husband could.

41:24.023 --> 41:25.941
So, please see what you can find.

41:33.574 --> 41:34.825
Is it ever Nate

41:35.242 --> 41:36.410
or always Nathan?

41:38.120 --> 41:39.120
Nathan.

41:40.956 --> 41:41.999
Like Francis.

41:42.458 --> 41:43.542
For me, anyway.

41:48.797 --> 41:51.383
Oh, have you spoken to Doug Stamper?

41:54.428 --> 41:55.428
No.

41:57.348 --> 41:58.682
I'm so worried about him.

41:58.766 --> 42:02.645
He did things no one
in this White House should be proud of.

42:26.627 --> 42:27.627
Hey, Mom.

42:27.836 --> 42:29.713
<i>How many people do you have there?</i>

42:29.797 --> 42:31.006
Not many.

42:31.298 --> 42:33.175
Nobody that interesting, anyway.

42:34.468 --> 42:35.844
Her visit to the base.

42:36.387 --> 42:37.429
Independence speech,

42:37.513 --> 42:39.890
<i>even the naughty soldier
is playing well for her.</i>

42:39.974 --> 42:42.434
Her charmed life persists.

42:43.060 --> 42:44.937
<i>Tell Uncle Bill we should step up.</i>

42:45.020 --> 42:47.856
I can manage the narrative. De-charm her.

42:47.940 --> 42:49.316
<i>He won't like that.</i>

42:49.400 --> 42:51.777
He's not going to like any of it,
so what's the difference?

42:52.778 --> 42:55.948
- I don't know.
- Mom, just say the word.

42:58.242 --> 42:59.242
Trust me.

42:59.535 --> 43:02.246
Don't do a thing
until I get back to you.

43:22.725 --> 43:24.852
Can't even tell you're still in DC.

43:25.519 --> 43:28.522
There are parts of this city
that will always remain a secret.

43:33.444 --> 43:34.804
I don't think I'll be welcome back

43:34.862 --> 43:37.615
in the White House press pool
anytime soon, FYI.

43:38.324 --> 43:39.366
Doesn't matter.

43:41.535 --> 43:42.995
She won't speak to me.

43:43.078 --> 43:45.873
- An interview? Not after...
- She will.

43:54.590 --> 43:56.967
<i>Tonight, for the first time,
he was forthcoming.</i>

43:57.051 --> 43:58.802
But still saying he's guilty?

43:58.886 --> 44:00.346
<i>Yeah, as always.</i>

44:01.430 --> 44:03.932
And did he mention Mr. Grayson by name?

44:04.016 --> 44:06.685
<i>No. He was just more distressed.</i>

44:07.353 --> 44:08.646
So he's getting worse?

44:08.729 --> 44:10.606
<i>Or better, he's finally talking.</i>

44:12.816 --> 44:16.111
But the idea of his leaving the facility
anytime soon,

44:16.737 --> 44:20.074
that's still out of the question.
I mean, for his own good.

44:20.282 --> 44:21.867
<i>He's either guilty of the crime</i>

44:21.950 --> 44:24.078
<i>- or psychotic for admitting to it.</i>
- Madam President,

44:24.703 --> 44:26.343
Miss Shepherd is on the White House line.

44:29.291 --> 44:32.169
Well, maybe it's time to give him
one of the antipsychotics.

44:32.586 --> 44:36.006
Possibly. But we'd have to consider
his history of addiction.

44:37.174 --> 44:39.218
By the way, in answer to your question,

44:39.551 --> 44:41.178
it was a letter opener,

44:41.261 --> 44:44.056
the last thing that Francis gave him
from his desk.

44:44.431 --> 44:45.891
<i>Keep me posted, Charles.</i>

44:46.266 --> 44:47.393
<i>And thank you.</i>

44:48.185 --> 44:49.185
Sure.

44:55.567 --> 44:57.945
<i>Are you prepared?</i>

44:59.780 --> 45:00.781
Excuse me.

45:01.490 --> 45:04.493
Don't you remember? Andover?

45:04.576 --> 45:05.994
Our prep school joke?

45:06.078 --> 45:10.290
I'm prepared to fail the test.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.127
Are you all right?

45:16.046 --> 45:20.426
I'm sorry to call so late.
I... I heard about what happened today.

45:23.345 --> 45:25.389
<i>These things have a tendency to leak out.</i>

45:26.348 --> 45:27.474
<i>I'm worried about you.</i>

45:28.267 --> 45:30.686
It's bulletproof, the motorcade glass.

45:30.769 --> 45:32.187
<i>Did they catch the guy?</i>

45:33.439 --> 45:35.190
How do you know it's a guy?

45:36.150 --> 45:37.651
It's always a guy, right?

45:43.240 --> 45:47.369
What was it Bill wanted adjusted
in my speech?

45:50.122 --> 45:52.416
<i>Oh. Something about...</i>

45:53.333 --> 45:54.418
<i>freedom.</i>

45:58.756 --> 46:00.424
You're in my thoughts, Claire.

46:02.217 --> 46:03.217
Thank you.

46:04.136 --> 46:06.221
<i>He's still with us, don't you think?</i>

46:06.305 --> 46:07.305
Who? <i>Frank.</i>

46:09.433 --> 46:12.770
<i>We're so glad we got to spend
so much time with him before he died.</i>

46:15.189 --> 46:17.149
He told us some fascinating things.

46:19.359 --> 46:20.652
He's been on my mind.

46:24.490 --> 46:27.326
<i>Bill and I finally went down to Gaffney
a few days ago...</i>

46:30.120 --> 46:31.622
<i>to pay our respects.</i>

48:20.606 --> 48:21.606
Claire!

48:21.940 --> 48:23.358
I shouldn't have let them.

48:23.442 --> 48:24.443
I'm sorry.

48:25.110 --> 48:26.236
Come on out now.

48:32.034 --> 48:33.327
Are you still there?

48:33.410 --> 48:34.410
Yes.

48:44.421 --> 48:45.923
Help!

48:50.302 --> 48:52.137
Help!

49:08.195 --> 49:09.195
I know.

49:09.446 --> 49:11.573
You want to know
what really happened to him.

49:12.491 --> 49:14.743
A man like Francis doesn't just die.

49:15.452 --> 49:16.495
That would be...

49:17.120 --> 49:18.246
what's the word?

49:19.957 --> 49:21.124
"Convenient."
