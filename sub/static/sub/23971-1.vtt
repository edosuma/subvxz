02:01:23.152 --> 02:01:26.322
Lord, today we bring
you our brother

02:01:27.365 --> 02:01:29.951
to take into your lovin' arms.

02:01:32.328 --> 02:01:37.500

with life everlasting.

(SOBBING)

02:01:41.504 --> 02:01:43.965
Lord, if it's the good
that you seek in men,

02:01:45.424 --> 02:01:48.469
then you ain't never
gonna find no better

02:01:48.552 --> 02:01:50.596
than Mr. Moses Washington.

02:01:53.933 --> 02:01:56.268
A man who had so many
reasons to be full of hate,

02:01:56.352 --> 02:01:57.812
yet he never was.

02:02:00.189 --> 02:02:03.359
And that, Lord, is one of
your greatest miracles.

02:02:08.906 --> 02:02:10.700
So let us not weep.

02:02:13.411 --> 02:02:15.705
Let us not shed
a tear here today

02:02:17.540 --> 02:02:19.875
'cause since the
day I knew him,

02:02:21.544 --> 02:02:24.588
all he ever wanted
to do was get free.

02:02:25.214 --> 02:02:26.507
Now he is.

02:02:31.762 --> 02:02:34.390
Moses deserved
a better world than this.

02:02:37.977 --> 02:02:39.937
Right now, he's got one.

02:02:53.743 --> 02:02:55.494
I guess that's it.

02:02:56.871 --> 02:02:59.665
It ain't but noon.
Others could show up.

02:02:59.749 --> 02:03:03.794
No, they're scared, Jasper.
Scared's a powerful thing.

02:03:06.714 --> 02:03:09.050
Don't seem too American
for an election to be over

02:03:09.300 --> 02:03:11.385
before it starts, does it?

02:03:11.469 --> 02:03:12.511
Nope.

02:03:15.056 --> 02:03:17.892
Well, we got 22 registered
Republicans here.

02:03:19.435 --> 02:03:21.437
We're damn sure
gonna vote.

We'll wait.

02:05:57.635 --> 02:05:59.970

I didn't have no choice.

is gonna be better for him?

02:08:01.175 --> 02:08:02.885
Yeah, that ain't
the point.

believe you really knew

family you were on.

What's your offer?

02:09:24.216 --> 02:09:28.011
We have no desire to send
your client to jail, Mr. Oaks,

02:09:28.095 --> 02:09:30.889
but we can't tolerate
this kind of example, either.

leave the state
of Mississippi,

02:09:37.271 --> 02:09:40.607

all charges against him.
