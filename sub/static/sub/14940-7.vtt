WEBVTT

00:00.062 --> 00:01.329
Previously on <i>Alphas...</i>

00:01.720 --> 00:03.810
Someone approached you
from the foundation.

00:03.910 --> 00:05.277
What did he ask you
to do?

00:05.345 --> 00:08.045
Trial tests.
August.

00:08.114 --> 00:09.581
Does "August"
mean anything to you?

00:09.649 --> 00:11.089
We'll figure it out.

00:11.157 --> 00:13.946
And there's a Jason Miller--
oh, Dr. Rosen.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.684
He's still here.
That's him.

00:15.751 --> 00:16.816
He's emitting
the infrasound.

00:16.884 --> 00:18.184
Is that
a photic stimulator?

00:18.251 --> 00:21.050
And we have no idea
what this thing does

00:21.118 --> 00:22.884
to people's brains,

00:22.952 --> 00:26.051
or how it fits into
Stanton Parish's agenda

00:26.119 --> 00:27.286
if, indeed, it does.

00:27.354 --> 00:28.920
Cargo train exploded
outside of Jersey City.

00:28.987 --> 00:30.890
There was no evidence
of a device.

00:30.958 --> 00:33.360
That's exactly
how Stanton Parish operates.

00:33.428 --> 00:35.962
Your 200-year-old
Alpha boogeyman?

00:36.030 --> 00:37.895
But he's very real,
Nathan,

00:37.963 --> 00:39.997
and, I believe,
extremely dangerous.

00:40.065 --> 00:42.402
Shot in the head.
There's nothing we can do

00:42.469 --> 00:44.006
for this poor soul.

00:46.576 --> 00:47.811
What's on your mind, Bill?

00:47.878 --> 00:49.512
Scipio knew that we
were gonna be there.

00:49.580 --> 00:50.779
I know.

00:50.847 --> 00:54.014
Someone close to us
is working with Parish.

00:58.788 --> 01:01.425
Yes, every August
medical photo stim

01:01.492 --> 01:03.059
has been recalled
and destroyed.

01:03.127 --> 01:04.294
Good.

01:04.361 --> 01:06.298
Make sure every import ban
is retroactive.

01:06.365 --> 01:08.767
Of course.

01:08.835 --> 01:10.203
The Health Technology
Safety Act

01:10.271 --> 01:11.471
contains that provision.

01:11.539 --> 01:12.907
Delete every record
of our meeting,

01:12.974 --> 01:15.709
every phone call,
every email.

01:15.777 --> 01:20.049
- But not here, Senator.
- Wait till you're alone.

01:20.117 --> 01:22.752
- I should wait until I'm alone.
- Right.

01:22.820 --> 01:27.859
And if anyone ever asks,
we're all friends.

01:27.926 --> 01:31.029
- You're friends.
- We're finished.

01:31.096 --> 01:33.699
Have a good night.
Good night.

01:41.910 --> 01:44.778
- You have another headache?
- No, it's fine.

01:44.847 --> 01:48.684
I'm just glad we'll be done
with all these trips to D.C.

01:48.751 --> 01:50.419
It's been
a long couple of weeks.

01:50.486 --> 01:52.488
Desperate times,
necessary measures.

01:52.556 --> 01:54.457
Look, watch out!

01:54.524 --> 01:55.525
Senator?

01:56.960 --> 01:59.462
St--st--stop!
Stop!

01:59.529 --> 02:00.831
Stop!

02:03.234 --> 02:06.270
Stop!

02:06.337 --> 02:08.472
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go.

02:11.977 --> 02:14.012
Charlotte...

02:14.079 --> 02:18.284
Go home.

02:18.351 --> 02:21.387
Excuse me,
I have to go home.

02:24.958 --> 02:28.227
Is she all right?

02:28.295 --> 02:30.496
I think so.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:40.442 --> 02:41.909
Hey.

02:44.079 --> 02:45.547
I'm gonna go grab
a drink.

02:45.614 --> 02:48.083
Yeah, okay.

02:51.088 --> 02:54.390
Ugh.

02:54.458 --> 02:57.093
What's he doing here?

03:09.774 --> 03:10.841
- Oh!
- Hi, Lisa.

03:10.909 --> 03:12.877
Hi, Jason.

03:12.944 --> 03:15.046
I was just wondering
if, um,

03:15.114 --> 03:16.281
you wanted
to hang out sometime?

03:16.348 --> 03:19.584
Well, I mean,
obviously, like, I know,

03:19.652 --> 03:20.818
right now,
we're hanging out,

03:20.886 --> 03:23.955
but we could see a movie
or something.

03:24.022 --> 03:25.690
It--well, whatever
you want to do.

03:25.757 --> 03:30.928
That's really sweet,
but, um, I have a boyfriend.

03:30.996 --> 03:33.297
So...

03:33.364 --> 03:35.999
Right, I know.

03:36.067 --> 03:38.201
But, listen, I was just--
Hey!

03:38.268 --> 03:39.702
Jase!

03:39.770 --> 03:41.637
This is the senior crunk.

03:41.705 --> 03:42.938
What, did you, uh,

03:43.006 --> 03:44.573
skip a grade
and not tell anyone?

03:44.640 --> 03:49.110
Cody!
Don't be a jerk.

03:49.178 --> 03:50.845
I'll make sure
he gets out okay.

03:50.913 --> 03:54.082
Stop it!

03:54.149 --> 03:55.850
You don't talk to Lisa.

03:58.553 --> 04:01.488
Look,
she's too nice to say it,

04:01.556 --> 04:03.023
but you creep her out.

04:03.091 --> 04:06.960
You creep everyone out.

04:07.028 --> 04:12.398
I said, "stop it."

04:15.902 --> 04:17.302
What did you do?

04:17.370 --> 04:19.937
He was in the hospital
for months.

04:20.005 --> 04:23.207
He almost died.
You could be a little nicer.

04:23.275 --> 04:26.577
You're right.
You should go out with Jason.

04:26.645 --> 04:28.646
- Cody, stop it.
- Seriously.

04:28.713 --> 04:30.614
Jason's really cool.
Really cool.

04:30.681 --> 04:33.550
Uh, he wants
to talk to you outside.

04:33.618 --> 04:38.622
Cody, you better not
have hurt him.

04:47.664 --> 04:49.798
What's going on?

04:49.865 --> 04:51.900
- Jason just wants...
- To talk to you.

04:58.172 --> 05:01.941
He just wants
to talk to you, Lisa.

05:06.446 --> 05:07.379
Jason.

05:07.447 --> 05:09.681
What's happening?

05:09.749 --> 05:12.617
I really never got a chance

05:12.684 --> 05:14.685
to tell you this before,

05:14.753 --> 05:17.854
but, um...

05:21.358 --> 05:24.993
You look really nice
tonight.

05:26.596 --> 05:30.332
I look really nice
tonight.

05:32.568 --> 05:33.602
Hey, Doc,

05:33.669 --> 05:34.603
those two kids
from the high school

05:34.671 --> 05:35.804
are in the sitch room,

05:35.872 --> 05:37.139
and here
is the police report.

05:37.207 --> 05:40.375
Thank you.
Uh, did Bill give this to you?

05:40.443 --> 05:42.477
Nah, he's not in yet,
so I just--

05:42.545 --> 05:43.912
he--he had a late night.
I gave him a call.

05:43.980 --> 05:45.247
Oh, okay.
He's the one

05:45.315 --> 05:47.016
who usually handles
this sort of thing, Kat.

05:47.083 --> 05:48.517
Yeah.

05:48.585 --> 05:49.885
You need to be working
on your--

05:49.953 --> 05:51.353
your memory issues,
right?

05:51.421 --> 05:52.554
Right,
but you said the key

05:52.622 --> 05:55.090
to memory construction
is active observation,

05:55.157 --> 05:57.659
so I am observing actively.

05:57.727 --> 06:00.795
So I got this idea--
probationary agent.

06:00.863 --> 06:02.998
Nice, huh?

06:03.066 --> 06:07.069
No, it's not nice.
It's not even a real thing.

06:07.136 --> 06:09.171
The Kat.
Yes, Gare?

06:09.239 --> 06:12.074
Yeah.
Bill's my partner,

06:12.142 --> 06:14.243
and you're not allowed to
just steal someone's partner.

06:14.311 --> 06:15.377
Oh, no.

06:15.445 --> 06:16.746
Yeah, I'm addressing
the issue.

06:16.813 --> 06:18.347
Right,
no partner stealing.

06:18.415 --> 06:19.882
Got it.

06:26.123 --> 06:29.292
Well, they've ruled out
drugs or alcohol.

06:29.360 --> 06:31.794
Perhaps there was some kind
of conversion disorder,

06:31.862 --> 06:33.429
mass hysteria...

06:33.497 --> 06:34.931
Whatever
you wanna call it,

06:34.999 --> 06:36.533
these 2 and 15 others

06:36.600 --> 06:38.534
chased a girl right out
of the senior dance.

06:38.602 --> 06:40.904
Half of them
didn't come home last night.

06:40.972 --> 06:43.540
I kind of read your file
before I gave it to you.

06:43.607 --> 06:45.909
Not very probationary.
Sorry.

06:45.976 --> 06:47.243
This young guy.

06:47.311 --> 06:49.746
What, did he walk through
a window or something?

06:49.813 --> 06:51.514
Plate glass.
Didn't even blink.

06:51.582 --> 06:54.284
Witnesses say they saw a kid
named Jason Miller

06:54.352 --> 06:57.554
with them, said he appeared
to be the leader.

06:57.621 --> 07:00.557
You know him?

07:07.031 --> 07:09.032
Hello.

07:09.099 --> 07:11.768
Can either of you tell us
anything about Jason Miller?

07:11.836 --> 07:16.406
I don't know
anyone named Jason.

07:16.473 --> 07:19.242
I'm guessing
that's a yes?

07:57.417 --> 07:59.885
Good morning.
Sorry I'm late, Doc.

07:59.953 --> 08:01.353
Well, what's
with your knee?

08:01.421 --> 08:04.056
I just tweaked it in ballet
class last night, so...

08:04.124 --> 08:05.624
Oh, that's where
they were teaching

08:05.692 --> 08:07.026
you how to kick
each other?

08:07.093 --> 08:09.228
I'm still getting
my work done, right?

08:09.296 --> 08:12.565
Well, we still haven't found
the breach in security.

08:12.632 --> 08:15.568
Uh, I did clear
the team and Kat--

08:15.636 --> 08:17.303
as much
as she could be cleared--

08:17.371 --> 08:19.272
but I'm still working
to clear, uh, support staff

08:19.340 --> 08:22.242
and friends, and family,
and tactical, all right?

08:22.310 --> 08:23.978
So I am thorough.
Yes.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.813
- And thorough takes time.
- Yes, you are.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.282
I-I understand,
but I'm gonna loop in Clay.

08:28.350 --> 08:29.617
Doc...

08:29.684 --> 08:31.118
Are you sure
you wanna do that?

08:31.186 --> 08:33.352
I don't think we can trust
that guy on something like this.

08:33.421 --> 08:34.955
Well,
I-I know it's a risk,

08:35.023 --> 08:38.458
but it's far more dangerous
to have a traitor in our midst.

08:38.525 --> 08:39.860
And besides, Clay
has some resources

08:39.928 --> 08:43.364
that you could
probably use.

08:43.431 --> 08:46.667
All right.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.902
Their neuroanatomies
are unique,

08:48.970 --> 08:51.338
but their brain patterns
are identical.

08:51.406 --> 08:52.806
That's, like,
impossible, right?

08:52.874 --> 08:54.976
Usually, brain patterns
are like snowflakes, Kat.

08:55.043 --> 08:57.011
Everyone
should be different.

08:57.079 --> 08:59.147
But when we compare
the EEGs,

08:59.215 --> 09:01.983
we see many identical areas,
their minds moving

09:02.051 --> 09:04.152
in some kind
of synchronization.

09:04.219 --> 09:06.687
But there is no indication
in either of their MRIs

09:06.755 --> 09:08.790
of any Alpha ability
at all.

09:08.857 --> 09:12.727
It looks as if they might have
become an extension of Jason's.

09:12.794 --> 09:14.762
Yeah, but at the hospital,
Jason could only project

09:14.830 --> 09:16.097
his personality
onto other Alphas,

09:16.165 --> 09:18.065
and even there,
the effect was temporary.

09:18.133 --> 09:21.102
Well, evidently,
his ability has evolved.

09:21.170 --> 09:24.872
Yeah, mine did
after the photo stim.

09:30.146 --> 09:33.782
They're emitting
an infrasonic field.

09:33.850 --> 09:36.150
I can hear it,
but barely.

09:36.218 --> 09:38.720
All right, Rachel,
stick with me here.

09:38.787 --> 09:40.855
When Jason
creates this field,

09:40.923 --> 09:43.458
he--he activates,
uh, somehow,

09:43.526 --> 09:45.626
uh, some sort
of neural link,

09:45.694 --> 09:47.195
through which
he could possibly

09:47.262 --> 09:49.530
exercise a measure
of synchronized control.

09:49.598 --> 09:54.035
Well, like, some kind
of hive mind.

09:56.638 --> 10:00.174
My father's allowing himself
to feel optimistic.

10:00.242 --> 10:03.011
August Medical.

10:03.078 --> 10:07.881
It's just a minor setback
for us.

10:07.949 --> 10:11.117
You're worried.

10:11.185 --> 10:12.485
Yeah, of course
I'm worried about him.

10:12.553 --> 10:14.086
So am I.

10:14.154 --> 10:15.988
You said that you
would bring him around

10:16.056 --> 10:19.124
to our way of thinking,
but you two are farther apart

10:19.192 --> 10:20.425
than you've ever been.

10:20.493 --> 10:22.694
Dani, some chasms
can't be bridged,

10:22.762 --> 10:24.529
certainly not from one side.

10:24.597 --> 10:26.130
No, he has a place
in what we're doing,

10:26.198 --> 10:28.400
in what we're building.
You've said that.

10:28.467 --> 10:31.036
- I'm hopeful.
- No, you made promises.

10:31.103 --> 10:33.771
Do you understand everything
I'm risking for this?

10:35.974 --> 10:38.575
There may be
an opportunity,

10:38.643 --> 10:41.879
a way to build
a better bridge.

10:41.946 --> 10:45.916
A former patient
of both of ours.

10:45.984 --> 10:48.752
She's just a kid.

10:48.820 --> 10:50.387
She's still gotta be
in there somewhere, right?

10:50.455 --> 10:51.655
I wish I knew, Nina.

10:51.723 --> 10:55.058
The medication seems
to be sedating them,

10:55.126 --> 10:57.226
but not breaking
Jason's neural link.

10:57.294 --> 10:58.661
I can't get a hold
of Jason's parents.

10:58.729 --> 11:00.063
Oh, we have
to keep trying.

11:00.130 --> 11:01.998
These kids
could be in danger,

11:02.066 --> 11:05.302
and Jason's
a disturbed young man.

11:05.370 --> 11:08.071
Poor boy has a lifelong history
of being ostracized

11:08.139 --> 11:09.606
due to his ability.

11:09.674 --> 11:10.874
The infrasound.

11:10.942 --> 11:12.109
It induces feelings
of discomfort

11:12.177 --> 11:14.010
and unease in people,

11:14.078 --> 11:15.245
and they don't like
being around him

11:15.313 --> 11:16.847
without even knowing why.

11:16.915 --> 11:18.582
Well, he's not alone
anymore, is he?

11:18.650 --> 11:21.084
Leave it to Parish
to make the borg a real thing.

11:21.152 --> 11:23.420
Hmm?

11:23.487 --> 11:27.091
It's a <i>Star Trek</i> thing.
Don't worry about it.

11:27.158 --> 11:29.360
No change at all.

11:29.428 --> 11:30.795
Nothing I've given them
has restored

11:30.862 --> 11:32.163
their normal brain activity.

11:32.231 --> 11:33.531
The primidone, phenytoin--

11:33.599 --> 11:35.466
Well, what about something
other than drugs?

11:35.534 --> 11:39.170
I could try.

11:39.238 --> 11:42.374
Carefully.

11:44.577 --> 11:47.378
All right.

11:49.482 --> 11:52.650
Molly?

11:52.718 --> 11:55.320
Molly, come back.

11:56.355 --> 11:57.322
Molly--

11:59.458 --> 12:02.494
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You all right?

12:02.561 --> 12:04.696
- Yeah, it's just--
- What happened?

12:04.763 --> 12:08.466
I felt, like, dozens of people
just fighting back.

12:08.534 --> 12:11.336
Okay, we're obviously
not trying that again.

12:11.403 --> 12:12.737
I don't know.
I-I don't think

12:12.805 --> 12:16.608
I can affect their will
because it's not their will.

12:16.676 --> 12:19.344
It's Jason's will,
and we have to find him

12:19.411 --> 12:21.445
if we're gonna have any hope
of breaking this connection,

12:21.513 --> 12:23.748
this--this neural link.

12:23.815 --> 12:25.416
I'm gonna ask his teachers

12:25.484 --> 12:27.485
if they have any idea
where he is.

12:45.497 --> 12:49.232
I believe he is here
somewhere, Bill.

12:49.299 --> 12:52.229
Kid could go anywhere,
and he goes to school?

12:52.297 --> 12:54.160
Well, probably for
the first time in his life,

12:54.228 --> 12:56.192
he has power
and influence,

12:56.259 --> 12:58.922
and so he's--
he's going back to a place

12:58.990 --> 13:01.090
where once he had none.

13:01.158 --> 13:03.959
It's just to show it off.
It makes sense.

13:04.027 --> 13:06.394
We'll be right there.

13:06.462 --> 13:09.263
Dr. Rosen?

13:09.331 --> 13:11.065
Jason.
You remember me?

13:11.133 --> 13:12.466
From--from the hospital?

13:12.534 --> 13:14.267
Yeah.
Uh, salt and vinegar chips.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.635
Right.

13:15.703 --> 13:18.537
To be honest,
I'm--I'm great now.

13:18.605 --> 13:20.772
Not like before.

13:20.840 --> 13:23.174
People used to mess with me
all the time,

13:23.242 --> 13:24.842
even teachers.

13:24.910 --> 13:26.544
Have you spoken
with your parents about that?

13:26.612 --> 13:29.547
Ah, my parents,
they were the worst.

13:29.615 --> 13:32.749
I mean, have you ever--
have you ever looked at somebody

13:32.817 --> 13:34.484
who was supposed to love you

13:34.552 --> 13:38.921
and you know that they
don't even like you?

13:38.988 --> 13:41.723
Anyways,
I'm all good now.

13:41.791 --> 13:43.691
See?
Ah, yes, I-

13:43.759 --> 13:46.327
now, I'm very happy to see
how well you've recovered.

13:46.395 --> 13:49.229
Um, Jason, I'd love to run
some tests back at my office,

13:49.297 --> 13:50.698
if you wouldn't mind.

13:50.765 --> 13:52.099
Nah, I-I told you,
I'm fine.

13:52.167 --> 13:53.734
Well, it would help me
understand you better,

13:53.802 --> 13:56.069
understand your ability,
see how you've managed

13:56.137 --> 13:58.505
to, uh, well,
recover so quickly--

13:58.573 --> 14:01.407
- I'm good.

14:02.676 --> 14:05.411
Thank you, Dr. Rosen.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.315
Uh, Jason, please,
wait--

14:17.323 --> 14:19.991
Excuse me.

14:27.032 --> 14:31.001
Jason,
I need you to listen to me.

14:31.069 --> 14:35.372
I'm worried that you might
be hurting your friends.

14:35.440 --> 14:36.573
I think it
has something to do with

14:36.641 --> 14:38.375
the connection
that you've made to them.

14:38.442 --> 14:41.243
You wanna
take them away.

14:41.311 --> 14:42.478
No, no, I don't.

14:45.849 --> 14:47.983
You touch them.
It's that simple.

14:48.051 --> 14:49.751
Promise me
you'll leave us alone,

14:49.819 --> 14:51.085
or I'll have him
pull the trigger.

14:51.153 --> 14:52.954
Jason, there's--
there's no need--

14:53.021 --> 14:54.956
Promise,
or I swear I'll do it.

15:10.404 --> 15:13.206
We should talk.

15:15.019 --> 15:16.552
What's our official story?

15:16.620 --> 15:19.380
We're gonna go with
accidental weapons discharge.

15:19.603 --> 15:20.737
Okay.

15:20.804 --> 15:22.338
Yeah, I think
that story will stick.

15:22.406 --> 15:23.606
Any leads?

15:23.673 --> 15:24.806
No, Gary still
hasn't been able to find

15:24.874 --> 15:26.041
anything on
security cameras, right?

15:26.109 --> 15:28.009
No.
They--oh, no, Bill.

15:28.077 --> 15:30.645
The cameras just went out.
That's not my fault.

15:30.713 --> 15:32.247
That's bad security.

15:32.315 --> 15:33.882
What happened to you?

15:33.950 --> 15:37.552
I'm following up a few leads
with the school psychologist.

15:37.620 --> 15:38.519
You need a hand?

15:38.587 --> 15:40.255
No, thank you, Bill.

15:40.323 --> 15:42.457
I'll meet you
back at the office.

15:42.525 --> 15:44.560
The public nature
of Jason Miller's actions

15:44.627 --> 15:46.128
are putting every Alpha
at risk.

15:46.196 --> 15:49.431
I expect you
to be celebrating it.

15:49.499 --> 15:51.600
What you managed to accomplish
with Jason Miller

15:51.668 --> 15:53.536
is truly remarkable.

15:53.604 --> 15:55.805
Imagine what he'd be capable
of if you hadn't intervened.

15:55.873 --> 15:58.107
I rescued that boy
from your experiments.

15:58.175 --> 16:01.046
We share responsibility
here, Lee.

16:01.114 --> 16:03.248
You interrupted
Jason's treatment.

16:03.316 --> 16:05.384
You failed to recognize
his instability,

16:05.452 --> 16:08.221
because you were too busy
shutting down August Medical.

16:08.289 --> 16:10.427
You neglected
his follow-up care.

16:10.495 --> 16:12.031
Well, he wouldn't
have needed follow-up care

16:12.099 --> 16:14.434
if you hadn't twisted him
into this--

16:14.502 --> 16:17.036
this thing that needs
to be stopped now somehow.

16:17.104 --> 16:18.771
Bullet to his head
would stop him.

16:18.839 --> 16:20.173
But I don't want that.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.275
I want you
to help me save him

16:22.342 --> 16:24.310
before this gets
out of our control.

16:24.378 --> 16:26.780
Oh, that's precisely
what I intend to do.

16:26.847 --> 16:28.214
I certainly don't need
your help for that.

16:28.282 --> 16:30.116
Because you've had
such success

16:30.184 --> 16:32.151
curing Jason's victims.

16:32.219 --> 16:34.287
Let me guess--you've tried
all the antiseizure meds,

16:34.354 --> 16:37.189
maybe even Nina?

16:37.257 --> 16:40.426
I have six months
of detailed scans and case notes

16:40.493 --> 16:44.062
on precisely what was done
to Jason's brain,

16:44.130 --> 16:47.699
the wavelength and the duration
of every stroke treatment.

16:47.767 --> 16:49.702
Please, Lee.

16:49.769 --> 16:53.806
I need you
to help me save Jason.

16:53.873 --> 16:57.576
Uh, thank you,
but I have my own team.

16:57.644 --> 17:01.013
You can keep the phone.

17:01.081 --> 17:05.685
Danielle was lucky
to find that flat on Avenue C.

17:05.752 --> 17:08.854
Such an old building.

17:08.922 --> 17:11.290
I remember it
from before the great war.

17:11.358 --> 17:15.627
Be a shame
if something happened to it.

17:22.502 --> 17:24.503
I was hoping to sway you
with other arguments.

17:24.571 --> 17:27.306
You're an uncompromising man.

17:27.374 --> 17:30.843
You have no idea
how uncompromising.

17:32.479 --> 17:34.680
You've been criticized
for your frequent trips

17:34.748 --> 17:36.249
to New York, Senator.

17:36.316 --> 17:39.385
I won't apologize for making
the needs of my constituents

17:39.453 --> 17:41.187
my top priority.
All right.

17:41.255 --> 17:43.522
Well, let's talk about
your new, hard-line stance

17:43.590 --> 17:47.126
on medical equipment
being imported from overseas.

17:47.194 --> 17:49.862
I need to make sure
the ban is retroactive.

17:49.930 --> 17:52.532
Well, I do believe your bill
does cover that, Senator.

17:52.599 --> 17:56.169
Yes, it does.
Of course it does.

17:59.039 --> 18:00.773
You're my friend,
aren't you?

18:00.840 --> 18:04.076
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

18:04.144 --> 18:07.412
We're done.
I need to go home.

18:07.480 --> 18:09.815
And that was Senator Burton,
recorded last night

18:09.883 --> 18:11.784
having some difficulties
during the interview--

18:11.852 --> 18:12.918
I know
she's staying there.

18:12.986 --> 18:14.987
Yeah, no, no,
just listen to me.

18:15.054 --> 18:16.588
I need to see her,
and you need--

18:23.663 --> 18:26.131
What's going on?

18:29.369 --> 18:31.903
Right this way.

18:31.971 --> 18:34.807
Jason's mother.

18:36.943 --> 18:39.344
Teenagers at the dance
weren't Jason's first victims.

18:39.412 --> 18:41.180
His parents were.

18:41.247 --> 18:45.150
She has dozens
of subdural hematomas.

18:45.218 --> 18:46.652
I think the connection
to her son

18:46.720 --> 18:49.989
is causing her brain
to--to rupture.

18:50.056 --> 18:50.856
She's gonna die
if you don't get her

18:50.924 --> 18:53.292
to a hospital immediately.

18:53.360 --> 18:56.362
But maybe you have
a surgical suite here somewhere?

18:56.430 --> 18:57.864
Take her to Saint Michael's.

18:57.932 --> 19:01.234
So her brain pattern
is struggling with Jason's.

19:01.302 --> 19:03.836
Does that mean
the others are in danger?

19:03.904 --> 19:06.806
Yes.

19:06.874 --> 19:09.308
And the adolescents
may have a little more time,

19:09.376 --> 19:12.178
given the relative flexibility
of their neuroanatomy,

19:12.245 --> 19:15.448
but, yes,
anyone connected to Jason

19:15.516 --> 19:16.883
is eventually
going to die.

19:16.951 --> 19:20.153
Quite an effective tool
of mass murder you've created.

19:20.221 --> 19:21.421
Not my intent.

19:21.489 --> 19:24.391
- Not your intent?
- And what about you?

19:24.459 --> 19:26.226
Using Nina Theroux
to forcibly push a senator

19:26.294 --> 19:27.227
to do your bidding.

19:27.295 --> 19:29.130
Not the same thing.

19:29.197 --> 19:31.098
Nina never intended
to hurt anyone.

19:31.166 --> 19:34.001
Not her intent.
Exactly.

19:34.069 --> 19:37.472
Let's get to work
before anyone else gets hurt.

19:39.309 --> 19:41.443
Senator Burton's
in the hospital.

19:41.511 --> 19:43.212
They're saying
it's exhaustion.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.047
It's always exhaustion.

19:45.115 --> 19:46.648
Now, has this
ever happened before?

19:46.716 --> 19:48.417
Not like this.

19:48.484 --> 19:50.252
Lee and I had no idea she'd
have this kind of reaction.

19:50.319 --> 19:51.553
Now, her doctors
would've never seen

19:51.620 --> 19:53.221
this kind
of condition before.

19:53.288 --> 19:55.056
But there are no names
on the film,

19:55.124 --> 19:56.758
nothing in here
to incriminate Dr. Rosen

19:56.825 --> 19:57.959
or the rest of the team.

19:58.027 --> 20:00.462
The only common thread
in there is me.

20:00.530 --> 20:03.098
Look, Nina.

20:03.166 --> 20:04.867
It's risky, okay?

20:04.934 --> 20:07.202
A senator
has a lot of resources.

20:07.270 --> 20:09.572
But it's a risk
I have to take.

20:09.639 --> 20:11.207
I need to fix this.

20:11.275 --> 20:13.309
You'll need
to loop Dr. Rosen in

20:13.377 --> 20:17.214
before you share this file
with the Senator's doctor.

20:17.281 --> 20:19.716
Don't worry.
He'll understand.

20:22.253 --> 20:26.455
Hello, Nina.
What can I do for you?

20:26.523 --> 20:29.958
What

20:30.026 --> 20:31.260
That was not Dr. Rosen.

20:35.760 --> 20:38.562
We could neutralize
the victim's infrasonic fields.

20:38.629 --> 20:41.164
No. Disrupting that amount
of brain activity

20:41.232 --> 20:43.266
would be fatal.

20:43.334 --> 20:45.034
And it appears
there is no limit

20:45.102 --> 20:49.205
to the number of people
Jason can collect.

20:49.273 --> 20:52.275
Oh, you didn't know that?
No.

20:52.342 --> 20:54.610
Always meant for Jason
to emerge from his coma

20:54.678 --> 20:59.148
with more control,
more maturity.

20:59.216 --> 21:01.084
Teenagers.

21:01.151 --> 21:03.653
Haven't changed much
since the 19th Century.

21:03.721 --> 21:06.856
I've raised my fair share.

21:06.924 --> 21:09.559
Remaining the same age

21:09.627 --> 21:12.095
while everyone around you
grows older and dies.

21:12.162 --> 21:15.231
That, uh, must be
very lonely.

21:15.299 --> 21:17.467
- I have my memories.
- Oh, I'm sure you do.

21:17.535 --> 21:20.303
But humans aren't built for
that kind of isolation, Stanton.

21:20.371 --> 21:23.239
I'm not here
to talk about me, Lee.

21:25.842 --> 21:27.376
All right.

21:27.444 --> 21:29.378
We can see how hard
all the minds

21:29.446 --> 21:30.980
in Jason's collective
are struggling

21:31.048 --> 21:32.649
to reassert themselves,

21:32.716 --> 21:35.852
so I'm thinking if, somehow,
we could push them to--

21:35.920 --> 21:37.654
Nina Theroux.

21:37.722 --> 21:38.889
She can get into his mind

21:38.956 --> 21:41.458
and get him to set
his collective free.

21:41.526 --> 21:44.928
No, I'd rather
not expose her to that risk.

21:44.996 --> 21:45.896
It's far too dangerous.

21:45.963 --> 21:47.497
Won't be a risk

21:47.565 --> 21:49.666
as long as I tell her exactly
how to navigate his mind.

21:49.734 --> 21:52.836
So you wanna work
together on that?

21:52.903 --> 21:55.404
Fine, then, uh,
I'll have to go find my team.

21:55.472 --> 21:57.973
Lee.

21:58.041 --> 22:00.676
You didn't wanna walk
into a trap.

22:00.744 --> 22:01.710
Neither do I.

22:04.947 --> 22:07.215
- Lee Rosen.
- No, you're not.

22:07.283 --> 22:08.583
What have you done
with him?

22:08.651 --> 22:09.984
We already know that
you're using cloning technology

22:10.052 --> 22:11.920
to bounce the number
off of cell towers

22:11.987 --> 22:13.154
all over the city.

22:13.221 --> 22:14.688
Watch your back.
We're coming for you.

22:14.756 --> 22:16.757
I hear echo,
so I know you're indoors.

22:16.825 --> 22:21.428
Gary, ignore
all the pings outside.

22:21.496 --> 22:22.997
There's 32 dots now.

22:23.064 --> 22:25.899
In minutes, they'll
be kicking down that door.

22:25.967 --> 22:27.267
May I?

22:27.335 --> 22:29.670
Okay, look for some place
big and empty,

22:29.738 --> 22:31.672
far away from traffic,
like a warehouse.

22:31.740 --> 22:33.241
Okay.

22:33.309 --> 22:35.276
Okay,
there are 17 dots now.

22:35.344 --> 22:37.245
Stan, you treated me
with respect,

22:37.313 --> 22:41.216
so as soon as we find Jason,
you will be free to go.

22:41.284 --> 22:44.252
Very well.
On your word.

22:44.320 --> 22:46.321
Hello, everyone.

22:48.824 --> 22:49.891
It's him.

22:49.959 --> 22:51.259
I'll explain
everything later.

22:51.327 --> 22:53.161
Right now,
we need to find Jason,

22:53.229 --> 22:56.131
and he's probably feeling
very vulnerable right now,

22:56.198 --> 22:57.765
so he'll wanna be
somewhere safe.

22:57.833 --> 22:59.334
Look for
an infrasonic field,

22:59.401 --> 23:01.369
a cluster at one
of his classmates' addresses.

23:01.437 --> 23:04.172
That's where
we'll probably find him.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.318
You're so beautiful.

23:18.855 --> 23:21.057
Why--why don't you
take your clothes off?

23:34.204 --> 23:36.872
Wait, no--
no, stop.

23:36.940 --> 23:40.476
I want you to want to do it.

23:40.544 --> 23:43.212
I want to do it.

23:43.280 --> 23:45.748
No, you don't.

23:45.816 --> 23:48.718
No, I don't.

23:50.387 --> 23:53.222
I'm sorry.

24:07.972 --> 24:10.740
Jason's in there.

24:21.718 --> 24:24.787
Okay, anybody else
a little freaked out by this?

24:24.855 --> 24:28.624
Two heartbeats.
He's not alone.

24:45.508 --> 24:47.342
I didn't touch her.

24:47.410 --> 24:49.478
Okay, all right.

24:49.546 --> 24:51.346
Well, let's just let her
get dressed now, okay?

24:51.414 --> 24:53.916
- Okay.
- Come here.

24:53.984 --> 24:55.918
I like Lisa, okay?

24:55.986 --> 24:57.453
But this isn't her.

24:57.520 --> 25:00.055
Hey, Jason, listen.
Dr. Rosen sent us.

25:00.123 --> 25:02.959
Okay, we're here to help you.
We can help her, too,

25:03.026 --> 25:05.661
but you gotta
come with us, okay?

25:05.729 --> 25:08.631
Okay.

25:17.576 --> 25:21.445
My first field assignment
is "go wait by the minivan"?

25:21.513 --> 25:23.514
Really?
Yeah. Recognize.

25:23.582 --> 25:26.685
It's supposed to be safer,
but I get arrested sometimes.

25:30.456 --> 25:31.957
No, stay back!
You'll spook him.

25:32.024 --> 25:33.191
Who are these guys?

25:33.259 --> 25:34.292
You said
you were with Dr. Rosen.

25:34.360 --> 25:35.260
We are.
Look, they're just here

25:35.328 --> 25:36.161
to protect you.
It's okay.

25:36.228 --> 25:38.296
Hey, guys.
Look.

25:42.968 --> 25:44.335
Hicks!
Get him to the car now.

25:44.403 --> 25:46.337
I changed my mind.
I-I don't wanna go.

25:46.405 --> 25:48.639
Hicks! Tranq him!

25:48.707 --> 25:51.308
I got him!

25:51.376 --> 25:53.043
Unh!

25:53.111 --> 25:54.679
- Ahh!
- They're like ants.

25:56.215 --> 25:57.782
Oh, there's more!
They're swarming.

25:57.849 --> 25:59.416
Kat, help!

25:59.484 --> 26:01.752
Ahh! Oh, they are.
They're like ants.

26:01.820 --> 26:03.387
Oh! Ah!

26:03.455 --> 26:06.023
Bill!
I can catch him!

26:06.091 --> 26:09.093
Gary!

26:33.085 --> 26:35.487
- Hey!
- Come on.

26:35.554 --> 26:37.989
Get off of there, pal!

26:38.057 --> 26:39.924
Unh!

26:44.129 --> 26:47.998
Hicks, let's go.

26:48.066 --> 26:49.767
- I was harmed.
- Come on!

26:49.835 --> 26:51.002
- Gary, move!
- Come on, quick.

26:51.069 --> 26:52.203
Yeah.

26:52.270 --> 26:54.171
Hurry!
Hurry, they're coming!

26:54.239 --> 26:58.308
- Easy, easy.
- Get in, let's go!

26:58.376 --> 27:00.711
Come on.
Bill, come on, let's go!

27:00.778 --> 27:02.913
Move, move!
Go, go, go!

27:19.610 --> 27:22.081
Prep him for an MRI
and an EEG.

27:22.082 --> 27:23.248
Be careful!
Come on, fast,

27:23.316 --> 27:24.684
before his friends show up.
Let me look.

27:24.751 --> 27:26.486
No, don't!
It hurts.

27:26.553 --> 27:28.254
I'm gonna have
a shiner now.

27:28.322 --> 27:30.056
And, Bill, it's your fault
that I got punched.

27:30.124 --> 27:31.258
Yeah, I get to punch you
now, Bill.

27:31.325 --> 27:32.526
It's my turn.

27:32.593 --> 27:34.461
Gary, no one
is gonna punch anybody, okay?

27:36.398 --> 27:39.366
Doc?

27:39.434 --> 27:43.537
Everyone...
This is Stanton Parish.

27:43.605 --> 27:45.572
'Sup, Stan?

27:50.377 --> 27:52.645
What?

27:54.515 --> 27:57.183
Dr. Rosen
better know what he's doing.

27:57.251 --> 28:01.421
Great confidence in you,
Miss Theroux.

28:01.488 --> 28:04.357
You've shown tremendous skill
in expanding your ability

28:04.425 --> 28:07.060
whenever given
the opportunity.

28:07.127 --> 28:08.328
All right,
so how do I do this?

28:08.395 --> 28:09.929
Jason's ability
is centered

28:09.997 --> 28:12.765
in the frontal polar
parietal cortices.

28:12.833 --> 28:14.500
He'll be vulnerable
to stimuli

28:14.568 --> 28:17.837
in the more fundamental areas
of his brain.

28:17.904 --> 28:20.406
So what he's saying,
Nina, is, uh,

28:20.473 --> 28:22.207
not to exert control
over his ability,

28:22.274 --> 28:24.075
uh, directly at the outset,

28:24.143 --> 28:27.012
the way you did
with the two high school kids,

28:27.079 --> 28:30.214
but instead,
to make him feel something

28:30.282 --> 28:33.150
on a more primal level
in order to distract him.

28:33.218 --> 28:35.819
Study his EEG
very carefully.

28:35.887 --> 28:37.821
I'm gonna try everything I can
to make him see reason,

28:37.889 --> 28:40.023
but I want you to be ready
just in case.

28:40.090 --> 28:41.190
Okay.

28:41.258 --> 28:43.926
Uh, I believe
we're done here.

28:43.993 --> 28:47.495
Mr. Harken and Mr. Hicks
will, uh, show you

28:47.563 --> 28:48.496
to the elevator.

28:48.564 --> 28:50.598
Good luck.

28:54.002 --> 28:57.303
We're not going
to the elevators, are we?

28:57.371 --> 28:58.771
We're going
to the elevator,

28:58.838 --> 29:00.472
just not gonna leave
the building.

29:00.540 --> 29:03.942
Hey!
You killed Anna.

29:04.010 --> 29:05.010
You killed
a lot of people,

29:05.077 --> 29:06.277
and now
you're gonna go to jail.

29:06.345 --> 29:07.845
I simply wanted her
arrested.

29:07.913 --> 29:09.113
The government
murdered Anna,

29:09.181 --> 29:10.415
and Dr. Rosen
did nothing to stop them.

29:10.482 --> 29:12.083
Okay, that's enough.

29:12.151 --> 29:13.618
Highland Mills?
The community in Maine?

29:13.685 --> 29:15.586
And now Jason Miller?

29:15.653 --> 29:16.920
Where Dr. Rosen goes,

29:16.988 --> 29:18.822
trouble
for Alphas follows.

29:18.890 --> 29:22.626
Gary, don't listen to him.
Come on.

29:26.197 --> 29:28.431
Signed and sealed.

29:28.499 --> 29:29.632
Come on,
we gotta get upstairs.

29:29.700 --> 29:31.034
Do not open that door,
understood?

29:31.102 --> 29:34.671
- Yes, sir.
- Under any circumstances.

29:46.181 --> 29:48.382
This is not
what we discussed, Lee.

29:48.450 --> 29:50.383
No.

29:50.451 --> 29:51.784
No, we're only beginning

29:51.852 --> 29:54.853
to understand
who each of us is.

29:54.921 --> 29:58.256
I learned a lot about you
today, Stanton.

29:58.324 --> 30:01.959
A man who says he's,
uh, helping to save dozens

30:02.027 --> 30:05.997
of lives, that's very
forthcoming about his motives,

30:06.065 --> 30:07.732
even the possibility
that he and I

30:07.800 --> 30:10.669
are not so different
on some level.

30:10.737 --> 30:14.674
Admits to weakness,
and error, and...

30:14.742 --> 30:17.043
I'm only human, Lee.

30:17.111 --> 30:19.612
It was only
to gain my trust.

30:19.680 --> 30:21.414
What happens to that poor,
damaged young man

30:21.482 --> 30:23.683
is incidental to you.

30:23.751 --> 30:27.786
You're trying
to, uh, how shall I say,

30:27.854 --> 30:30.556
recruit me,
aren't you, Stanton?

30:33.293 --> 30:35.995
You have to admit,
we make a great team.

30:36.063 --> 30:39.833
It's never going
to happen.

30:39.900 --> 30:43.670
You should not
have threatened Danielle.

30:48.109 --> 30:51.645
Guard,
could I have some water?

30:54.449 --> 30:56.317
Please?

30:58.454 --> 31:01.089
I wanna go now,
Dr. Rosen.

31:03.927 --> 31:07.796
Jason, the people
in your neural link,

31:07.864 --> 31:09.398
you--you must let them go.

31:09.465 --> 31:10.866
You have to set them free.

31:10.933 --> 31:12.234
No, I don't.

31:12.301 --> 31:15.070
Because I'll be alone again,

31:15.137 --> 31:17.905
and you have no idea
how that felt.

31:19.241 --> 31:22.277
During World War II,
an American Lieutenant

31:22.344 --> 31:24.412
and his squad

31:24.480 --> 31:26.380
came across
a field of potatoes

31:26.448 --> 31:27.949
while out foraging.

31:28.017 --> 31:30.952
The Lieutenant left
to speak to the farmer,

31:31.020 --> 31:34.923
ordered his men
not to go into the field.

31:34.991 --> 31:37.493
He was just
being cautious.

31:37.560 --> 31:40.662
The men were starving.

31:40.730 --> 31:44.866
They hadn't eaten
in days.

31:44.934 --> 31:48.770
All that food,
just sitting there.

31:48.838 --> 31:53.842
When the Lieutenant returned,

31:53.909 --> 31:56.110
half his men were dying
and the other half were dead.

31:56.178 --> 31:59.980
Blown to pieces.

32:00.048 --> 32:02.983
The Germans
had been laying mines

32:03.051 --> 32:06.687
in some of the fields
as they retreated.

32:06.755 --> 32:11.225
That Lieutenant was me.

32:11.293 --> 32:15.030
A desperate man
will do just about anything.

32:26.208 --> 32:29.944
Your mother is in a coma,
Jason, right now.

32:31.747 --> 32:34.582
And that's gonna happen
to everyone else--Lisa, too.

32:34.650 --> 32:35.783
I don't believe it.
You're lying.

32:35.851 --> 32:38.319
I'm not hurting them, okay,

32:38.386 --> 32:39.286
because I can feel
their thoughts,

32:39.354 --> 32:41.555
and believe me,
it feels good.

32:41.623 --> 32:43.156
For the first time
in my life,

32:43.224 --> 32:44.725
I feel like I belong.

32:44.792 --> 32:47.828
I really want to go now.

32:50.231 --> 32:53.266
Nina, I'm afraid I'm going
to need you after all.

32:53.334 --> 32:54.668
Are you ready?

32:54.736 --> 32:56.169
I'll be right there,
Lee.

32:56.237 --> 32:58.572
- I really wanna go now.
- I really wanna go now.

32:58.639 --> 33:00.340
- I really wanna go now!
- I really wanna go now!

33:00.407 --> 33:02.142
- I really wanna go now.
- I really wanna go now.

33:02.210 --> 33:05.445
- I really wanna go now!
- Go back to sleep.

33:05.513 --> 33:07.114
- They're here.
- Gary, how many?

33:08.983 --> 33:13.019
I think
all of them.

33:15.989 --> 33:17.823
Power's out,
but the backup's on.

33:17.891 --> 33:19.191
Secure stairwells are clear,

33:19.259 --> 33:20.960
but they're coming up
the public ones.

33:21.028 --> 33:22.762
Oh, okay.
I'll close the blast door.

33:22.830 --> 33:24.330
No, no, no, no.
Hicks is bringing up tranq guns.

33:24.398 --> 33:25.699
Well, he should hurry up,

33:25.766 --> 33:27.434
'cause they're gonna close
automatically.

33:27.502 --> 33:29.269
Damn,
there's a lot of them.

33:29.337 --> 33:31.037
Hey, we're gonna need teams
in the main entrance

33:31.105 --> 33:32.605
and all public stairwells.

33:32.673 --> 33:34.607
Tranq guns only, copy?

33:34.675 --> 33:36.843
Tranq guns only.
Right away, sir.

33:40.782 --> 33:43.417
Agent Harken, come in.

33:49.158 --> 33:50.792
That wasn't the lesson.

33:50.859 --> 33:53.695
The lesson is follow orders.

34:19.810 --> 34:23.580
I got the tranq guns.
Drama queen.

34:28.520 --> 34:30.121
They're being crushed.

34:30.188 --> 34:31.523
All right, we're gonna have
to let these kids in.

34:31.590 --> 34:33.024
They're gonna kill
themselves.

34:33.092 --> 34:34.192
All right,
let's drop back,

34:34.260 --> 34:36.795
try and buy ourselves
some more time.

34:36.862 --> 34:39.098
Bill.

34:39.166 --> 34:40.632
All right,
Gary, now.

34:46.039 --> 34:47.005
Whoa.

34:49.577 --> 34:52.344
Doc, I don't know how long
we can hold out here.

34:52.413 --> 34:55.248
Tell Nina, hurry.

34:58.921 --> 35:00.154
Jason's gone.

35:00.222 --> 35:01.556
'Cause that's
just what we need.

35:01.624 --> 35:02.657
Perfect.

35:02.725 --> 35:03.892
Well, he's still here
somewhere,

35:03.960 --> 35:07.395
because those kids
are still attacking.

35:14.270 --> 35:15.203
Check Parish.

35:15.270 --> 35:18.005
Choi, Grant.

35:18.072 --> 35:20.074
How's Parish?
Respond.

35:20.141 --> 35:23.411
Choi, Grant, respond.

35:23.478 --> 35:25.679
Get back to the office.

35:25.747 --> 35:27.581
I'll check this area.

35:31.520 --> 35:34.288
If they get through,
is this gonna be enough?

35:40.930 --> 35:42.731
Jason!

35:42.798 --> 35:44.866
Dr. Rosen?
Dr. Rosen, something's wrong.

35:44.934 --> 35:46.602
He said that he'd get me
out of here,

35:46.669 --> 35:49.838
then he locked himself
in that room.

35:49.906 --> 35:52.642
You brought Parish
into your neural link?

35:52.710 --> 35:54.710
He said that he wanted me to,
but now something's happening

35:54.778 --> 35:56.078
and I can't stop it.

35:56.146 --> 35:58.448
He wants to take control
of your collective.

35:58.516 --> 36:00.116
But it's going
to be all right, Jason.

36:00.184 --> 36:02.786
Let me help you.

36:02.853 --> 36:05.655
Bring me in, please.

36:30.983 --> 36:34.686
Jason? You--

36:34.754 --> 36:37.255
Jason, everyone here

36:37.323 --> 36:39.891
is part of your
shared consciousness.

36:39.959 --> 36:42.494
I know, but--
but he's taking them away.

36:42.561 --> 36:45.330
Stanton.

36:45.398 --> 36:47.365
How are you doing this?

36:47.433 --> 36:50.035
It's sort
of a neural failsafe.

36:50.103 --> 36:52.638
It's an important early step
in Jason's treatments.

36:52.706 --> 36:57.210
You didn't think I would create
something I couldn't control,

36:57.277 --> 36:59.845
did you?

36:59.913 --> 37:01.547
No, no, no, no,
please, not you.

37:01.615 --> 37:03.883
Lisa.

37:03.951 --> 37:06.385
Lisa!

37:16.662 --> 37:19.464
Those doors
aren't gonna hold forever.

37:19.532 --> 37:21.299
I must admit

37:21.367 --> 37:25.102
I didn't see the boy's
full value until just now.

37:25.170 --> 37:27.738
You've grown far more powerful
than I ever anticipated, Jason,

37:27.806 --> 37:32.676
but you're clearly
not comfortable with leadership.

37:32.744 --> 37:35.945
Jason, you don't have
to let him do this.

37:36.013 --> 37:38.347
- Don't listen to him, Jason--
- You can break the link!

37:38.415 --> 37:39.515
He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

37:39.583 --> 37:41.284
You can set
all these people free.

37:41.352 --> 37:43.787
He doesn't understand us.
He's not like us.

37:43.855 --> 37:46.390
Go, Jason.
Be with your friends.

37:46.458 --> 37:48.359
Set them free, Jason.

37:48.427 --> 37:50.461
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!

37:50.529 --> 37:52.230
- It's your brain.
- You'll be alone.

37:52.298 --> 37:54.232
I don't want it to be
like it was before.

37:54.300 --> 37:56.368
- It will not be like before.
- Yes, it will.

37:56.436 --> 38:00.172
Trust me, Jason.

38:13.321 --> 38:15.055
Jason!

38:15.123 --> 38:16.123
No!

38:16.191 --> 38:17.625
No!

38:38.112 --> 38:41.114
Look.

38:41.182 --> 38:42.949
They're stopping.

38:43.017 --> 38:44.918
Think we're okay?

38:44.986 --> 38:47.287
I can't hear
the infrasonic fields anymore.

38:47.354 --> 38:49.956
It wasn't me.

38:50.023 --> 38:52.091
Where's Dr. Rosen?

38:56.529 --> 38:59.030
Jason.

38:59.098 --> 39:02.667
Jason.
Jason.

39:02.735 --> 39:06.271
Oh, Dr. Rosen?

39:06.338 --> 39:09.274
Thank you, Jason.

39:09.341 --> 39:11.543
I know that was
a very difficult choice to make,

39:11.611 --> 39:15.782
but your ability,
and--and that man,

39:15.849 --> 39:17.750
who knows
what would've happened.

39:17.818 --> 39:19.785
Dr. Rosen, you okay?

39:19.853 --> 39:22.321
No, we're--we're fine.
It's fine.

39:22.389 --> 39:23.423
Where's Parish?

39:28.996 --> 39:30.663
Damn it.

39:30.731 --> 39:32.365
D.O.D. bean counter
said we don't need

39:32.433 --> 39:35.235
ballistic glass
on every floor.

39:37.138 --> 39:39.873
You see anything?

39:43.344 --> 39:45.312
Nothing.

39:45.379 --> 39:49.249
He's gone.

39:58.366 --> 40:00.436
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:00.438 --> 40:03.840
I finally got all those kids
checked out and sent home.

40:03.908 --> 40:06.009
Three of those little boys
asked me out on a date.

40:06.077 --> 40:09.112
Well, that's sweet.

40:09.180 --> 40:11.114
You could, you know,
buy your date his beer.

40:11.181 --> 40:12.448
No! Oh, my goodness!

40:12.516 --> 40:13.883
And they smelled
like they bathed in cologne.

40:13.951 --> 40:15.084
It was really gross.

40:15.152 --> 40:17.886
It was just--

40:23.693 --> 40:26.061
John has introduced me
to scotch.

40:26.129 --> 40:27.196
Mmhmm.

40:27.263 --> 40:29.398
I have a really
wicked bottle

40:29.465 --> 40:32.300
of 18-year-old Oban
in my office.

40:32.368 --> 40:34.302
I have something I need
to take care of tonight.

40:34.370 --> 40:35.537
Mmm.

40:35.604 --> 40:36.771
You're taking the file

40:36.839 --> 40:38.407
to the senator's doctor, huh?

40:38.474 --> 40:40.375
Rain check?

40:40.443 --> 40:43.546
Rain check.

40:43.613 --> 40:46.582
By the way, if--

40:46.650 --> 40:47.984
if you're not
sleeping with him,

40:48.051 --> 40:50.453
and he's still buying you
$100 scotch,

40:50.521 --> 40:53.123
he's a keeper.

40:53.190 --> 40:55.926
We'll see.

41:00.999 --> 41:03.000
Hell of a couple
of days, huh?

41:03.068 --> 41:05.770
Ah, yes, indeed.

41:05.838 --> 41:08.640
Hey, Doc.

41:13.546 --> 41:15.881
Parish knew our layout cold.

41:15.948 --> 41:17.949
Now, normally, I would say
that that is luck,

41:18.017 --> 41:21.820
but something tells me
this guy makes his own luck.

41:21.887 --> 41:24.256
It wasn't his luck,
Cameron.

41:24.323 --> 41:29.060
It was my own overconfidence,
thinking I could--

41:29.128 --> 41:31.496
I could trap him here somehow.
That was--

41:31.563 --> 41:33.230
that was a brilliant move
on his part.

41:33.298 --> 41:36.100
He wanted me to bring him here
so he could meet all of you.

41:36.168 --> 41:41.306
Well, wheels within wheels.

41:41.373 --> 41:43.775
Sorry.

41:43.842 --> 41:45.309
Uh, being inside his head
has--has given me

41:45.377 --> 41:47.144
a lot to think about.

41:47.212 --> 41:51.014
We're gonna get him.
You know that, right?

41:52.384 --> 41:55.319
Okay, let me
just grab my bag, and...

41:56.789 --> 41:58.289
- Cameron?
- Yeah?

41:58.357 --> 42:01.292
Is, is that a new one
of Dani's?

42:01.360 --> 42:03.361
Yeah,
she just finished it.

42:03.429 --> 42:06.531
You haven't seen it
before?

42:23.016 --> 42:25.885
Yes, I have.
