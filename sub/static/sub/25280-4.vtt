01:11.988 --> 01:14.324
I've waited an eternity for this.

01:15.408 --> 01:20.330
We've done everything we can to prepare us
for this moment. We're ready.

01:22.665 --> 01:25.585
It means so much to me
to share this with you.

01:35.094 --> 01:37.972
Beginning system check.
Front and rear stabilizers.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.600
Front and rear stabilizers are go.

01:40.683 --> 01:44.229
-Quintessence collection array.
-Quintessence collection array is go.

01:44.312 --> 01:47.065
- Infracells.
- Infracells up.

01:47.524 --> 01:50.151
- Dynotherms.
- Dynotherms connected.

01:50.568 --> 01:52.445
Switching on mega-thrusters.

01:52.529 --> 01:54.405
Mega-thrusters are go.

01:57.826 --> 02:00.787
I can't be the only one
who sees that this is nuts, right?

02:00.870 --> 02:02.580
Just getting in there is a long shot.

02:02.664 --> 02:05.542
-Then they have to make it out again?
-I agree with Hunk.

02:05.625 --> 02:08.461
This plan is a foolhardy
and unnecessary risk.

02:08.544 --> 02:13.174
I don't know. We've traveled through
the quintessence field to another reality.

02:13.258 --> 02:16.845
This isn't just theoretical physics.
Mathematically, we know it's possible.

02:16.928 --> 02:20.640
Well, it is hard to argue with math.
Believe me, I've tried.

02:20.723 --> 02:23.476
But even if they do reach
the quintessence field, then what?

02:23.560 --> 02:26.229
The last time anyone got in there,
it turned Zarkon evil.

02:26.312 --> 02:29.315
Lance makes a fine point! Take that, math!

02:29.691 --> 02:32.110
Zarkon fell prey
to his own evil instincts.

02:32.193 --> 02:35.822
The quintessence field didn't create them,
it revealed them.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.439
So, this is goodbye...

03:10.523 --> 03:11.357
for now.

03:12.483 --> 03:13.318
Allura.

03:14.777 --> 03:16.279
Yes, Lance?

03:16.362 --> 03:18.740
- Get back safe.
- I will.

03:26.956 --> 03:29.584
T-minus ten ticks to gate entry.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.002
Nine...

03:32.086 --> 03:33.087
eight...

03:34.255 --> 03:35.256
seven...

03:36.257 --> 03:37.258
six...

03:38.593 --> 03:39.594
five...

03:40.762 --> 03:41.763
four...

03:42.513 --> 03:43.514
three...

03:45.016 --> 03:46.017
two...

03:47.018 --> 03:47.852
one.

03:49.270 --> 03:51.689
-Are you ready?
-Here we go.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.639
Extraordinary.

04:34.732 --> 04:36.234
What is that?

04:36.317 --> 04:38.861
I've got an incoming craft.

04:39.946 --> 04:42.156
Shields up. And pull it up on-screen.

04:43.449 --> 04:45.576
That... That can't be.

04:46.035 --> 04:48.705
It's an Altean pod! A really old one!

04:49.539 --> 04:51.207
What's it doin' out here?

04:51.291 --> 04:55.586
Let's find out.
Attention, Altean pod, identify yourself.

04:56.629 --> 04:58.214
Shiro, it's Keith.

04:58.298 --> 05:01.050
Keith! Are you okay?

05:01.134 --> 05:02.510
Where have you been?

05:02.593 --> 05:04.762
How did you get your hands
on that pod?

05:04.846 --> 05:07.890
Does he look bigger to you guys?
He's bigger, right?

05:08.599 --> 05:10.893
- No?
- Where's Lotor?

05:10.977 --> 05:14.480
- He's in the quintessence field.
- Oh, no.

05:16.983 --> 05:19.902
Readings are beyond
anything I could have imagined.

05:19.986 --> 05:24.407
What we do here today will change
the course of the universe forever.

05:26.242 --> 05:31.039
In the hands of the wrong person,
this power could easily corrupt.

05:31.998 --> 05:34.125
Together, we'll see it never does

05:34.208 --> 05:37.712
and continue the work
your father started so long ago.

05:39.922 --> 05:43.468
Now, let's see
if we can collect some samples.

05:58.274 --> 06:00.568
Keith, it's so good to see you.

06:00.651 --> 06:03.071
Hold on. How do we know
you're the real Keith

06:03.154 --> 06:05.531
and not his bigger, cooler,
grizzled older brother?

06:05.615 --> 06:09.160
-I don't have time for this, Lance!
-Hey, everybody, Keith's back!

06:09.243 --> 06:12.538
We need to stop Lotor.
He's been lying to all of us!

06:12.914 --> 06:15.958
- Wh-- Lying about what?
- Everything!

06:18.336 --> 06:20.505
You're... You're Altean!

06:21.047 --> 06:23.633
- And who's the Galran?
- Is that a wolf?

06:24.133 --> 06:25.676
Where did you come from?

06:25.760 --> 06:28.387
I promise I'll explain everything
once we get to Lotor.

06:28.471 --> 06:31.933
We can't get to him. He just entered
the quintessence field with Allura.

06:32.475 --> 06:36.187
We traveled through realities before.
Can't we fly in there and attack?

06:36.270 --> 06:39.148
She said Allura is with him.
We can't risk hurting her.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.109
Why are we even attacking?

06:41.192 --> 06:43.236
Look, Keith-- Everyone, calm down.

06:43.319 --> 06:46.030
When they return,
we'll get this all sorted out.

06:53.162 --> 06:56.124
I can feel the quintessence
coursing through me.

06:56.207 --> 07:01.254
It's like my spirit,
my whole being, is more alive.

07:09.720 --> 07:12.348
Lance is right. You have changed.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.642
Time is different where I've been.

07:14.725 --> 07:17.228
Shiro, I am Krolia.

07:17.687 --> 07:20.148
Keith has told me all about you.

07:20.731 --> 07:24.193
Thank you for raising him
to be the man he is today.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.779
Krolia is with the Blade of Marmora.

07:26.863 --> 07:27.697
Also...

07:28.739 --> 07:29.740
she's my mother.

07:31.159 --> 07:34.912
-It's an honor to meet you.
-What? Okay, this is nuts!

07:34.996 --> 07:38.291
You come back with your Galra mom,
a wolf, and an Altean?

07:38.374 --> 07:42.003
Yes, I'm still waiting to hear the story
of how you found this Altean.

07:42.086 --> 07:44.547
And why we're supposed to be
attacking Lotor.

07:44.630 --> 07:48.885
This is Romelle,
and I think she should tell her own story.

07:48.968 --> 07:52.138
I come from a planet
where there are thousands of Alteans.

07:52.221 --> 07:55.308
We have lived there
since the war with Zarkon began.

07:56.142 --> 08:00.480
What? That's impossible.
Altea was destroyed.

08:00.563 --> 08:03.065
Allura and I were the only survivors.

08:03.149 --> 08:08.237
Every Altean child knows the story
of how Lotor saved us from destruction.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.989
When Zarkon attacked,

08:10.072 --> 08:12.909
many were off-planet
on trading expeditions.

08:14.452 --> 08:17.788
When news spread
about the destruction of our home,

08:17.872 --> 08:21.250
those of us who remained
went into hiding for deca-phoebs.

08:21.959 --> 08:25.296
But Lotor, with his deep knowledge
of Altean culture,

08:25.379 --> 08:27.757
managed to track some of them down.

08:29.926 --> 08:33.596
Hear me out!
I know who you are. I come in peace.

08:39.434 --> 08:42.188
I have come to save
the noble Altean people,

08:42.270 --> 08:44.315
to preserve your customs and traditions

08:44.398 --> 08:47.109
before they are destroyed
like Altea itself.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.403
Please, come with me.

08:49.487 --> 08:53.157
I have created a haven
where the Galra will never find you.

08:53.241 --> 08:56.369
It may not be Altea,
but it will keep you safe.

08:58.287 --> 09:02.416
If my intention were to kill you,
then you would be dead already.

09:12.134 --> 09:14.136
To keep the Alteans secure,

09:14.220 --> 09:17.974
Lotor hid them on a remote planet
beyond the quantum abyss.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.478
So, Lotor saved Alteans?

09:23.271 --> 09:25.982
Man, Lotor is even nicer
than we thought.

09:26.857 --> 09:31.279
And over time, the Alteans
came to worship Lotor as their savior.

09:32.530 --> 09:36.784
Generations ago, in an effort
to increase our odds of survival,

09:36.867 --> 09:41.497
Lotor announced that he was creating
another colony far from our own.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.417
But in order to do so, he needed to assess

09:44.500 --> 09:48.087
which Alteans were viable candidates
to survive the journey.

09:48.796 --> 09:53.801
One by one, every Altean in the colony
was given a series of tests.

10:01.392 --> 10:05.104
Those who were deemed fit for the journey
were loaded onto a cargo ship

10:05.187 --> 10:07.273
and taken to the second colony.

10:07.356 --> 10:09.567
It was considered the highest honor.

10:10.151 --> 10:13.613
Any communication between the colonies
was strictly prohibited

10:13.696 --> 10:16.741
for fear that it would compromise
the other's location.

10:18.409 --> 10:20.911
This was the world I was born into,

10:20.995 --> 10:24.332
one of unquestioning devotion
to a supposed messiah.

10:24.999 --> 10:29.337
My brother Bandor was always faithful,
but I had questions.

10:31.922 --> 10:35.259
So many of our people
gone to the new colony.

10:35.343 --> 10:40.139
Petrulius, Gnautu, Rahz,
and of course, Mother and Father.

10:40.931 --> 10:43.684
I miss them all so much.

10:43.768 --> 10:46.187
I'm sure we'll have a chance
to see them again

10:46.270 --> 10:48.481
when we're chosen to travel
to the new colony.

10:48.564 --> 10:50.941
But why can't we talk to them now?

10:51.025 --> 10:53.736
Lotor must have a way
of communicating with them.

10:53.819 --> 10:57.990
He travels there all the time.
So, why does he keep us in the dark?

10:58.532 --> 10:59.575
You know why.

10:59.659 --> 11:03.371
Communication with the other colony
would risk discovery by the Galra.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.706
So we're told.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.802
Eventually,
Bandor grew old enough

11:17.885 --> 11:20.930
to be assessed for the journey
to the other colony,

11:21.013 --> 11:23.641
and he was selected to leave immediately.

11:26.018 --> 11:27.311
Don't do this!

11:29.814 --> 11:31.482
It is Lotor's will.

11:31.565 --> 11:33.609
I'll never see you again!

11:34.402 --> 11:36.821
Don't let him tear our family apart.

11:37.822 --> 11:41.951
Don't worry. I'm sure you'll be selected
to come to the colony soon.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.454
In the meantime, I made you something.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.332
It's a communicator.

11:51.252 --> 11:54.213
Will I be able to talk to you
on the other colony?

11:54.296 --> 11:58.175
I haven't had a chance to test it yet,
but I hope so.

11:58.259 --> 12:03.931
Just remember, we suffer this isolation
so the next generation may not have to.

12:05.599 --> 12:06.851
Goodbye, Romelle.

12:23.033 --> 12:27.329
When Bandor left,
I felt completely alone.

12:28.622 --> 12:33.335
I tried to use the communicator
he had given me, but it never worked.

12:44.138 --> 12:45.306
Bandor!

12:45.973 --> 12:46.932
Romelle...

12:47.850 --> 12:48.976
you were right.

12:49.894 --> 12:53.397
-Where are you?
-The forest outside town.

12:54.231 --> 12:55.065
Hurry.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.170
Bandor!

13:17.838 --> 13:18.839
Lotor...

13:19.715 --> 13:22.176
The other colony...

13:23.052 --> 13:24.512
It's all a lie.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.518
- No.
- Over here.

13:36.440 --> 13:39.693
Clean up the wreckage.
Leave no evidence this ever happened.

13:49.662 --> 13:54.333
My brother was dead.
I knew the truth, or at least part of it,

13:54.416 --> 13:58.546
but I also knew that no one
would believe me without proof.

13:58.629 --> 14:03.467
When Keith and Krolia arrived,
they were my last chance at finding it.

14:03.551 --> 14:07.012
I told them what had happened
to my brother, and as it turned out,

14:07.096 --> 14:09.890
so many Alteans
that had been taken before him.

14:10.683 --> 14:14.687
As they explained their mission to me,
we knew there must have been a connection

14:14.770 --> 14:18.899
between the missing Alteans
and the pure strain of quintessence.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.652
Given your brother's
weakened state,

14:21.735 --> 14:23.571
he couldn't have piloted his ship
for very long.

14:24.196 --> 14:26.365
The other colony has
to be somewhere nearby.

14:26.448 --> 14:29.618
There is a moon orbiting this planet
that could house a colony.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.996
Well, it's our only lead.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.040
But how will we get there?

14:35.708 --> 14:37.042
I have an idea.

14:42.798 --> 14:45.634
These transports
haven't been used in generations.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.469
None of the Alteans in the colony

14:47.553 --> 14:50.222
would know how to fly one,
even if we desired to.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.603
I think I got us covered there.

15:04.987 --> 15:06.739
There's something down there.

15:39.980 --> 15:44.693
No! Petrulius! What's happening to them?

15:44.777 --> 15:47.905
These people were supposed
to be headed to the colony!

15:47.988 --> 15:50.574
Lotor is harvesting their quintessence.

15:54.286 --> 15:56.580
That's horrifying.

15:56.664 --> 16:00.668
-All this time...
-I can't believe he fooled us.

16:01.126 --> 16:02.169
He's a monster.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.588
Huh?

16:05.965 --> 16:09.218
- They're back.
- What are you waiting for? Open fire!

16:09.718 --> 16:11.679
No! Princess Allura is with him.

16:11.762 --> 16:14.223
-We're gonna let him back onboard?
-We must!

16:14.306 --> 16:18.102
As long as the princess is with him,
we cannot risk any sort of attack.

16:18.185 --> 16:21.605
Coran and Lance are right. We can't
do anything until the princess is safe.

16:22.022 --> 16:24.858
Once Allura is secure,
we will take Lotor down.

16:35.577 --> 16:38.205
We accomplished
something amazing today,

16:38.288 --> 16:41.250
and it would've never happened
had it not been for you.

16:41.333 --> 16:45.129
It is a moment
that I truly will never forget.

17:02.563 --> 17:05.148
What's going on?

17:07.651 --> 17:09.778
Allura, step away from Lotor.

17:10.445 --> 17:13.781
I will do no such thing.
Tell me what's happening here.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.617
Lotor is a monster

17:15.701 --> 17:19.121
and has been harvesting
Altean quintessence for generations!

17:19.954 --> 17:21.205
An Altean!

17:23.791 --> 17:26.962
You killed my brother
and thousands of others.

17:27.337 --> 17:32.217
Lotor has been lying to us the whole time.
He's a murderer, just like his father!

17:32.301 --> 17:34.303
You know nothing about what you speak.

17:34.386 --> 17:38.098
-What are they talking about?
-Allura, listen to me.

17:38.182 --> 17:41.310
I've dedicated my life
to preserving Altean culture.

17:41.393 --> 17:43.645
Now that we have unlocked
the quintessence field,

17:43.729 --> 17:46.899
all of your people, who would have been
hunted down long ago

17:46.982 --> 17:50.694
had it not been for my intervention,
can live in peace.

17:50.778 --> 17:53.489
Were some lives lost in the process? Yes.

17:53.864 --> 17:56.283
But they were martyrs to a noble cause.

17:56.366 --> 18:00.245
I sacrificed a few
to preserve the future for millions.

18:00.329 --> 18:03.957
Allura, do not let this ruin
everything we've worked for.

18:04.041 --> 18:06.919
Think of what we experienced
in the quintessence field.

18:19.556 --> 18:21.141
The hangar's been breached!

18:21.892 --> 18:24.311
It's Lotor's troops.
They're stealing the ships!

18:27.648 --> 18:28.482
Shiro?

18:29.858 --> 18:33.487
Give in. You cannot resist.

18:35.823 --> 18:37.282
What's happening to him?

18:43.580 --> 18:47.417
You are mine now. Give in!

18:50.420 --> 18:53.048
Allura and I will secure Lotor.
Hunk, help Shiro.

18:53.132 --> 18:56.009
Everyone else, get down to the hangar
and stop those guys.

18:56.093 --> 18:57.678
Shiro?

19:00.347 --> 19:03.350
- Shiro, what are you--
- Lance!

19:46.393 --> 19:48.145
Shiro's gone mad!

19:48.228 --> 19:51.940
He's escaping with Lotor!
Stop him before he leaves the ship!

20:12.669 --> 20:15.797
Good. Now, bring him to me.

20:18.842 --> 20:21.762
-What do we do?
-We have to stay focused.

20:21.845 --> 20:25.098
Lance, Hunk,
can you still pilot your lions?

20:25.182 --> 20:26.516
Yeah, I'll manage.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.685
We've got this.

20:29.102 --> 20:32.814
Then let's go! If we're gonna fight
Lotor's ships, we'll need Voltron.

20:32.898 --> 20:36.026
Shiro's gone.
Who's gonna pilot the Black Lion?

20:36.109 --> 20:37.110
I will.

21:04.012 --> 21:05.305
Shiro, it's Keith!

21:06.306 --> 21:08.350
Shiro, it's gonna be okay.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.435
We just have to--

21:11.770 --> 21:14.147
- I can't shake them! Help!
- Keith!

21:42.134 --> 21:45.512
Guys, we're no match for them
in our lions.

21:45.762 --> 21:47.597
Form Voltron!

21:48.305 --> 21:54.606
