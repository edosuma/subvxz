00:23.457 --> 00:26.492
- The story
is often told of Cupid.

00:26.494 --> 00:29.862
But his origins, his true story,

00:29.864 --> 00:31.930
is far from the
tales we've read.

00:33.100 --> 00:36.135
Cupid was the son of
the two Roman gods:

00:36.137 --> 00:38.337
Venus, his mother,
the goddess of love,

00:38.339 --> 00:41.573
beauty, and fertility;
his father Mars,

00:41.575 --> 00:44.443
the god of war and justice.

00:44.445 --> 00:47.346
Meeting under unlikely
circumstances,

00:47.348 --> 00:49.882
an affair blossomed
between the couple

00:49.884 --> 00:53.886
and they gave life to
Cupid himself, a Roman god.

00:55.289 --> 00:58.624
With his parents' influence,
Cupid would protect love

00:58.626 --> 01:01.126
and all it stood for
in his growing years.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.763
And when it came to
finding love for himself,

01:04.765 --> 01:06.432
Cupid found himself
falling in love

01:06.434 --> 01:09.435
with Psyche, the
goddess of soul.

01:10.638 --> 01:13.972
However, his mother
grew jealous,

01:13.974 --> 01:17.709
jealous of the beauty that
Psyche held not only within,

01:17.711 --> 01:19.178
but on the surface, too.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.881
Venus, an aging
goddess, grew bitter

01:22.883 --> 01:25.350
over the youthful
look Psyche held;

01:25.352 --> 01:29.555
she was possibly the most
beautiful woman in all the land.

01:30.891 --> 01:34.793
And soon Venus barred Cupid
from being with Psyche.

01:34.795 --> 01:37.096
Banning any love
between the couple,

01:37.098 --> 01:38.730
disapproving of their love.

01:40.134 --> 01:44.103
But the true love between them
could not hold Psyche back.

01:44.105 --> 01:47.406
She begged for hope,
for approval from Venus.

01:48.776 --> 01:52.945
Venus agreed to grant Psyche
and Cupid eternal love,

01:52.947 --> 01:57.983
if Psyche were to complete
three impossible tasks.

01:58.853 --> 02:00.652
Psyche accepted the challenge.

02:00.654 --> 02:04.289
Assured that Psyche would be
unable to complete these tasks,

02:04.291 --> 02:07.359
confident she may not
even come back alive,

02:07.361 --> 02:09.928
was surprised when
Psyche returned,

02:09.930 --> 02:11.830
having completed all three.

02:13.033 --> 02:16.168
Every step she took,
every breath she drew

02:16.170 --> 02:18.637
brought her closer to her love.

02:18.639 --> 02:21.940
But Psyche was weak; she
fell before the castle.

02:23.310 --> 02:26.812
Unable to stand, unable to
make it to the door itself,

02:26.814 --> 02:31.250
to give Venus the gifts
she'd been tasked to win.

02:31.252 --> 02:34.286
Cupid, realizing the
love Psyche had for him,

02:34.288 --> 02:36.955
immediately attended her side.

02:36.957 --> 02:39.725
Thinking he could save
her, he pricked her

02:39.727 --> 02:42.494
with the energy from
his arrow's spike.

02:43.998 --> 02:47.766
However, this is where
the story changes.

02:49.303 --> 02:52.371
People believe Cupid
to have saved Psyche,

02:52.373 --> 02:55.374
and they were to have
lived happily ever after.

02:55.376 --> 02:58.410
However, the true
story behind the legend

02:58.412 --> 03:01.079
is not so happily ever after,

03:01.916 --> 03:02.881
not at all.

03:03.817 --> 03:06.518
The true story is much darker.

03:07.988 --> 03:11.390
Cupid believed he was to
give Psyche the ambrosia

03:11.392 --> 03:14.426
from his arrow, to live forever.

03:14.428 --> 03:17.462
But what he didn't know,
was that Venus had tampered

03:17.464 --> 03:20.599
with the arrow,
lacing it with poison.

03:20.601 --> 03:23.502
Killing Psyche with
the prick of his arrow,

03:23.504 --> 03:26.538
Cupid fueled with rage
towards his jealous mother

03:26.540 --> 03:29.641
and un-supporting father,
flew around the town,

03:29.643 --> 03:33.145
attacking the townspeople,
promising to never support

03:33.147 --> 03:34.746
or allow love again.

03:35.783 --> 03:38.684
If he could never
experience love himself,

03:38.686 --> 03:41.453
he wanted no one else to.

03:41.455 --> 03:44.790
Full of anger, Cupid
went to the dark depths

03:44.792 --> 03:48.227
of the Underworld
and came face to face

03:48.229 --> 03:50.662
with the god of death himself.

03:52.499 --> 03:56.034
Angered by Cupid demanding
assistance for revenge,

03:56.036 --> 03:58.804
the god of death
had another idea.

03:58.806 --> 04:02.574
He warped Cupid's mind, filling
him with the darkest anger

04:02.576 --> 04:04.309
that can never be shaken off.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.980
For eternity feeling
hatred towards love

04:07.982 --> 04:10.682
and those who abused
it, and filling him

04:10.684 --> 04:13.785
with a demonic energy,
flowing through his blood.

04:15.189 --> 04:19.791
Over centuries, and under
the right circumstances,

04:19.793 --> 04:23.662
the Roman god Cupid
himself can be summoned

04:23.664 --> 04:27.599
to defend and protect
what he represents:

04:27.601 --> 04:32.204
Bringing fury to bear
on those who abuse love.

04:45.085 --> 04:45.984
- Mm!

04:47.087 --> 04:49.921
You know, I didn't
exactly expect myself

04:49.923 --> 04:52.591
to be flying all over the
world, living the life,

04:52.593 --> 04:54.393
earning endless
streams of money.

04:55.496 --> 04:58.697
But here I
am, what can I say?

04:58.699 --> 05:02.534
- So, you're like,
totally successful, right?

05:02.536 --> 05:03.735
- Well, it kinda depends on

05:03.737 --> 05:05.904
what you class
success as, right?

05:05.906 --> 05:08.240
If you class it as a guy
that's worked his way

05:08.242 --> 05:10.909
to the top without a
starting boost in life.

05:10.911 --> 05:13.378
Do you class it as a guy
that's gone from A to B

05:13.380 --> 05:16.148
all off his own back,
and now lives the life

05:16.150 --> 05:18.350
a lot of people have to
win the lottery to achieve?

05:18.352 --> 05:19.951
'Cause if so, then yeah.

05:19.953 --> 05:22.054
- Wow!

05:22.056 --> 05:25.824
You're like, such a
bachelor, aren't you?

05:25.826 --> 05:26.992
- Well, it kinda depends on

05:26.994 --> 05:28.960
what you class a
bachelor to be, right?

05:28.962 --> 05:30.595
I mean, do you class it as a guy

05:30.597 --> 05:33.265
that lives in a
penthouse apartment,

05:33.267 --> 05:35.967
has four cars,
his own concierge?

05:35.969 --> 05:37.169
- You know what?

05:37.171 --> 05:40.605
Hold that thought just
two seconds, okay?

05:41.742 --> 05:44.443
I'm going to nip to
the little girls' room.

05:44.445 --> 05:45.877
- Hurry back, sweetheart.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.979
I got plenty more stories
that I can tell ya.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.915
- Oh, I'm sure you do.

06:01.562 --> 06:02.794
- Hey, how's it going?

06:02.796 --> 06:05.597
- Oh my god, this
guy is a total jerk!

06:05.599 --> 06:07.399
I am not stooping this low.

06:07.401 --> 06:09.067
- Oh, you
knew the drill, right?

06:09.069 --> 06:12.070
Why else go on a date with
someone from a Sugar Daddy site?

06:12.072 --> 06:14.005
- Yeah well,

06:14.007 --> 06:17.943
I can't imagine myself face-deep
in his crotch all night.

06:17.945 --> 06:21.213
So look, it's not gonna happen.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.448
No spa getaway is worth this.

06:24.551 --> 06:25.884
- What
are you gonna do?

06:29.990 --> 06:34.092
- I'm gonna get
the fuck out of here.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.965
- Sandy, what are
you doing here?

06:39.967 --> 06:43.268
I'm in the middle of an
important business meeting.

06:43.270 --> 06:44.770
- Dad, I'm sorry.

06:45.773 --> 06:47.773
I am so sorry.

06:48.642 --> 06:49.741
- Come on, Sandy!

06:49.743 --> 06:51.643
If this is about
me and your mom,

06:51.645 --> 06:54.646
these things happen; people
break up all the time.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.815
- I shouldn't have.

06:56.817 --> 06:57.883
I'm sorry.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.618
I've screwed up!

07:00.521 --> 07:02.788
I've really screwed up.

07:02.790 --> 07:05.190
- Okay, okay.

07:05.192 --> 07:06.925
Sandy, look at me.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.393
Look at me, Sandy.

07:08.395 --> 07:09.961
Look at me.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.330
You need to tell me what
on Earth is going on.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.634
- They're all gone.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.836
- What are you talking about?

07:17.838 --> 07:18.670
Who's gone?

07:18.672 --> 07:19.971
Who is gone?

07:19.973 --> 07:21.306
- He killed them all.

07:22.709 --> 07:25.210
I was mad at you for the way
you left mom in that state.

07:25.212 --> 07:27.512
- It was a mutual decision.

07:27.514 --> 07:29.448
- She said you were
cheating with young sluts.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.016
I got angry.

07:31.018 --> 07:33.485
I shouldn't have done it.

07:33.487 --> 07:35.954
I didn't think it would work.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.156
- What are you talking about?

07:41.562 --> 07:43.128
Sandy?

07:50.637 --> 07:51.536
- Cupid.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.606
I summoned a demon.

07:58.579 --> 08:00.645
- Let's take this outside,
shall we, young lady?

08:00.647 --> 08:02.247
Come here!
- Dad, listen to me.

08:02.249 --> 08:04.549
Please, please
just listen to me!

08:04.551 --> 08:06.384
Dad, you've gotta listen to me!

08:06.386 --> 08:08.220
Listen to me, please!

08:08.222 --> 08:09.921
Dad!

08:09.923 --> 08:11.556
Dad, please.

08:11.558 --> 08:14.159
- I don't know what the hell
you've taken, young lady.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.895
But I don't need it
in my life anymore.

08:16.897 --> 08:19.831
You and your mother
can take your issues,

08:19.833 --> 08:22.200
and let some other poor
asshole deal with 'em.

08:22.202 --> 08:23.101
- Please.

08:24.271 --> 08:25.170
- I'm done.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.308
- Hey, Carl.

08:30.310 --> 08:33.477
- Hey, what are
you doing out here?

08:34.515 --> 08:37.015
- Just, you know,
getting some fresh air.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.419
Hey!

08:42.456 --> 08:44.489
- Yeah, this is--

09:03.610 --> 09:06.011
What the hell is that thing?

09:08.815 --> 09:09.881
- We gotta go!

09:44.818 --> 09:47.319
We lost him, we lost him!

09:48.155 --> 09:50.021
- What is going on?

09:50.023 --> 09:52.724
- I summoned it after
what you did to mom.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.895
We gotta keep moving. We can't
stop; we gotta wait it out.

09:56.897 --> 09:58.897
It'll be over.
- Where?

10:00.033 --> 10:01.499
- Look, we can't stop;
we gotta keep moving.

10:01.501 --> 10:03.435
We gotta wait it out
and it'll be over.

10:03.437 --> 10:05.236
- Where is your mother?

10:08.008 --> 10:08.907
- She's gone.

10:17.751 --> 10:19.050
No!

10:19.052 --> 10:19.951
Dad!

10:21.121 --> 10:24.522
I don't
want this, please!

10:24.524 --> 10:26.291
- No!

10:26.293 --> 10:29.628
No, no, no, no, no!
- Please, no, no, no!

10:29.630 --> 10:33.264
No, no, no!

10:34.134 --> 10:35.400
- God no!

10:35.402 --> 10:37.102
No, no, no, no, no!

10:37.104 --> 10:38.136
No, no!
- No!

10:39.606 --> 10:44.576
- No, please,
please!

10:44.578 --> 10:45.877
- No, please!

10:45.879 --> 10:48.146
No, no!

10:48.148 --> 10:48.980
Please no!

10:48.982 --> 10:52.450
No, please

10:55.022 --> 10:59.057
- No, no!

10:59.059 --> 10:59.991
No, please!

11:12.005 --> 11:15.340
- No, please

12:00.053 --> 12:02.053
- Bring his energy to me.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.489
Allow his energy to
fuel me with love.

12:05.592 --> 12:08.727
Allow me to return the
gift of sight and love.

12:36.156 --> 12:38.757
- Morning, Miss Drake.
- Mr. Jones.

12:38.759 --> 12:41.593
How are you today?
- Very well, very well.

12:42.996 --> 12:45.830
I was wondering your plans
for the Valentine's Day Ball.

12:45.832 --> 12:49.100
I was wondering if you needed
someone to tend to your needs?

12:50.971 --> 12:51.870
A drinking buddy.

12:53.073 --> 12:55.006
You know, last year I
worked out a secret way

12:55.008 --> 12:56.741
to pass the time.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.810
A little something,
something in the drinks.

12:58.812 --> 13:00.545
Easy to swing by Old Harper.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.046
- Are you suggesting I drink

13:02.048 --> 13:04.682
while supervising underage
teens at a Valentine's ball?

13:04.684 --> 13:06.284
- No, come on.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.519
Nothing of the sort.

13:07.521 --> 13:08.987
- I thought you had
tomorrow evening off.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.922
- Yeah, I was but
Harper wants these

13:10.924 --> 13:12.824
to go away with feedback.

13:12.826 --> 13:14.292
- That's so not on.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.261
We're always given spring
break to get it done.

13:16.263 --> 13:18.129
- Try telling Harper.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.330
He's having none of it.

13:22.002 --> 13:24.669
But look, I'm around
tomorrow night, as are you.

13:25.839 --> 13:28.006
Maybe you and I need
a little head space.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.440
Maybe I can swing by?

13:29.442 --> 13:30.341
- Maybe.

13:31.244 --> 13:32.143
- Maybe.

13:35.582 --> 13:36.648
- Ah, sorry!

13:39.152 --> 13:40.985
Hope I'm not
interrupting anything?

13:40.987 --> 13:42.420
- Oh no.

13:42.422 --> 13:45.423
- Mr. Jones, one of your
students has gum in her hair.

13:45.425 --> 13:46.891
- Ah!

13:46.893 --> 13:47.792
On my way.

13:48.628 --> 13:49.527
Thank you.

13:59.739 --> 14:00.905
- Ah!
- Sorry, sorry!

14:00.907 --> 14:02.841
God, she's such a bitch!
- Yeah.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.075
- Why can't she find
something else to do

14:04.077 --> 14:06.511
other than do stuff
like this to you?

14:06.513 --> 14:07.345
- She's lashing out.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.746
Her Dad was a dick.

14:08.748 --> 14:11.449
If my mom hadn't--
- Faye, this is so

14:11.451 --> 14:13.985
not your fault; she's
a total douche bag.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.553
Oh my god!

14:16.389 --> 14:17.622
- Ladies?

14:17.624 --> 14:19.524
- Hey, Mr. Jones,
how's it going?

14:20.427 --> 14:21.793
- Smoking again in here?

14:21.795 --> 14:23.828
- Smoking? I don't smoke.

14:23.830 --> 14:25.330
You don't smoke, do you, Faye?

14:25.332 --> 14:27.999
No, it must be you
smelling things.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.234
- Just don't get caught.

14:29.236 --> 14:30.969
Smoking's seriously bad for you.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.303
And Matt,

14:33.573 --> 14:35.440
it does not make
one's voice deeper.

14:35.442 --> 14:38.076
- Seriously, that was the
reason I was doing it.

14:39.012 --> 14:40.311
Also, girls' toilets?

14:40.313 --> 14:42.080
Ladies only.
- Hey, hey.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.916
I'm one of the gals, see?

14:44.918 --> 14:45.917
What can I say?

14:47.120 --> 14:49.287
Give us a moment, Matt.

14:49.289 --> 14:50.922
- Sure, she's all yours.

14:55.061 --> 14:57.061
- Hey, how you doing?

14:57.063 --> 14:58.363
Your hair all right?

14:58.365 --> 15:00.298
- It's getting there, thanks.

15:11.144 --> 15:15.914
- You know, if it's Elise and
her cronies doing this to you,

15:15.916 --> 15:19.417
if just tell me, I can
do something about it.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.519
- I'm fine, honestly.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.822
- I can help, if
you just tell me.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.625
- Thank you.
- Are you sure?

15:31.164 --> 15:33.464
- I better get to class.

15:33.466 --> 15:37.168
- Right, senior's next;
I'm your cover teacher.

15:37.170 --> 15:38.236
See you there?

15:51.618 --> 15:52.517
Hey, Elise.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.053
- Hey, Mr. Jones.

15:55.055 --> 15:57.088
- Cut it out, all right?

15:57.090 --> 15:58.389
What do you mean?

15:58.391 --> 16:00.224
- Keep it up with Faye,

16:00.226 --> 16:02.060
your little Valentine's dance,

16:02.062 --> 16:05.563
I'll pull the plug
in a heartbeat.

16:05.565 --> 16:08.466
- You know, hanging out
in the girls' toilets,

16:08.468 --> 16:09.934
it doesn't look too good.

16:11.538 --> 16:14.939
If I said, that you
caught me in there,

16:16.009 --> 16:19.978
unclothed, think I
could get you sacked,

16:21.181 --> 16:24.148
in a heartbeat.

16:33.093 --> 16:36.160
- Romeo and Juliet, they
were from two sides.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.664
Thinking they could get
away with their relationship

16:39.666 --> 16:41.065
in secrecy.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.539
- I think my spell is working.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.341
- No, not this again.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.879
- Elise!

16:56.216 --> 16:58.416
Maybe you'll know.
- Mm hmm?

16:58.418 --> 17:00.952
- How did Shakespeare
present capitalist attitudes

17:00.954 --> 17:03.554
and their relationship
in the play as a whole?

17:11.097 --> 17:14.098
Keep your mouth closed, and
maybe you can answer me.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.770
Right, Act Two,

17:19.939 --> 17:20.905
let's get reading.

17:28.882 --> 17:31.149
- Look at what I got myself.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.784
- You realize there's a new
upgrade available, right?

17:32.786 --> 17:33.885
- Oh shut up!

17:35.688 --> 17:36.587
- Elise.

17:37.590 --> 17:38.656
Who's is that?

17:41.494 --> 17:42.693
- Oh my god, stop.

17:42.695 --> 17:45.763
Isn't that--
- Mr. Jones, uh huh.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.231
- Why do you have his phone?

17:48.668 --> 17:50.935
- Does anyone know
what Faye's number is?

17:51.938 --> 17:53.037
- You bitch.

17:53.039 --> 17:55.206
- Wow!

17:55.208 --> 17:57.408
- So you think that
chancing a few online spells

17:57.410 --> 18:00.211
is going to get Mr. Jones
to fall in love with you?

18:00.213 --> 18:02.113
- He's different with me now.

18:02.115 --> 18:04.649
It's like he's actually into me.

18:04.651 --> 18:07.618
- Mr. Jones is just the most
charismatic person going.

18:07.620 --> 18:08.986
Everyone loves him.

18:08.988 --> 18:10.655
Christ, even I love him a bit.

18:10.657 --> 18:11.756
I'd turn gay for him.

18:12.792 --> 18:15.960
Faye, come on, a
teacher with a student?

18:15.962 --> 18:18.262
Why don't you go for
someone your own age?

18:19.099 --> 18:19.997
- Like who?

18:23.236 --> 18:25.303
There's no one.

18:45.558 --> 18:46.457
- Shit!

19:01.541 --> 19:03.574
Faye, honey please!

19:03.576 --> 19:06.811
It's mom.
- What do you want?

19:06.813 --> 19:08.246
- Don't close me out.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.148
Okay, come on, open up.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.315
- I'm fine.

19:14.020 --> 19:15.086
- Please?

19:17.524 --> 19:20.725
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

19:20.727 --> 19:23.494
I didn't think you
would be back early.

19:23.496 --> 19:26.497
It was a heat of
the moment thing.

19:27.934 --> 19:30.401
- You really think dad
would think this is okay?

19:31.638 --> 19:34.705
The first Valentine's
since his passing and,

19:36.075 --> 19:39.210
you just hook up with a dad
of a girl from my school.

19:41.214 --> 19:43.381
You realize she despises
me for it, right?

19:44.684 --> 19:46.951
Today I had gum in
my hair 'cause of it.

19:48.488 --> 19:49.387
- Look,

19:51.791 --> 19:54.592
I think sometimes
people need to move on.

19:56.196 --> 19:59.230
It's not healthy to
wallow in the past.

19:59.232 --> 20:03.501
Honey, I had to move
on, and so should you.

20:05.705 --> 20:08.639
I'm sorry if it's not
what you wanted to hear.

20:12.979 --> 20:15.079
Dinner will be ready soon.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.883
I'll leave it by your door.

20:53.052 --> 20:54.085
- Oh my god!

21:04.897 --> 21:08.132
Hey, it's nice to
get a text from you.

21:13.406 --> 21:16.340
Hey, thanks for the text.

21:16.342 --> 21:17.742
Oh god, no.

21:23.883 --> 21:24.782
Hey,

21:26.419 --> 21:28.152
I felt it today too.

21:29.489 --> 21:30.388
Oh god.

21:32.258 --> 21:33.157
Send.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.223
I will see you then.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.466
What kind of picture?

23:26.038 --> 23:27.505
- Oh my god!

23:28.841 --> 23:29.807
- What is she wearing?
- Thinking she's all hot.

23:29.809 --> 23:31.375
- She legit looks constipated.

23:32.445 --> 23:34.211
She definitely stuffs her bra.

23:34.213 --> 23:36.147
- Why are you so
mean to that girl?

23:36.149 --> 23:37.681
- Don't ask, Brett.

23:37.683 --> 23:39.450
- She and her mom are
sneaky little hoes

23:39.452 --> 23:40.885
who've got it coming.

23:40.887 --> 23:42.486
That's all that
needs to be said.

23:42.488 --> 23:44.455
- You get me so riled
up when you're naughty.

23:44.457 --> 23:48.259
- Ew, please remember, you
have people in the same room.

23:48.261 --> 23:50.628
- Anyway, what are we
doing with this exactly?

23:52.932 --> 23:54.298
- Wait and see, bitches!

24:06.746 --> 24:07.845
- Oh my god!

24:07.847 --> 24:10.181
What are you doing?

24:10.183 --> 24:12.349
You ignore my texts
but bring me a rose?

24:12.351 --> 24:13.584
Nice one.

24:13.586 --> 24:15.619
- No, look, I lost my phone.

24:15.621 --> 24:19.223
A new one's coming,
but I did email you.

24:21.327 --> 24:23.327
Look, the dance is tomorrow.

24:24.363 --> 24:26.864
As I said, I'm around
marking papers.

24:26.866 --> 24:28.165
I could come and say hi?

24:29.202 --> 24:30.768
- I love it, I really do.

24:30.770 --> 24:33.504
But what if someone
comes in right now

24:33.506 --> 24:36.073
and sees this going down?

24:36.075 --> 24:37.608
- Come on, no one's around.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.010
Take the rose.

24:43.883 --> 24:45.883
- I'm glad it isn't plastic.

24:46.953 --> 24:48.519
- You two love
birds at it again?

24:48.521 --> 24:49.587
- What? No!

24:50.690 --> 24:53.057
- You must think I'm
completely stupid.

24:53.059 --> 24:54.024
Look--
- No idea what you're

24:54.026 --> 24:55.726
talking about, Principal Harper.

24:55.728 --> 24:57.795
- I don't care, as long
as you keep your hands

24:57.797 --> 24:59.296
off each other in the school.

24:59.298 --> 25:01.398
And leave it at the gate when
it does eventually go south.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.467
I don't wanna be dealing
with the fallout.

25:04.704 --> 25:06.136
Nice rose.

25:06.138 --> 25:08.138
- I should get back to class.
- Now, that is what I do

25:08.140 --> 25:11.976
like to hear; some of us
actually come here to work.

25:14.514 --> 25:15.379
- Yeah.

25:42.775 --> 25:44.375
- Matt, hey!

25:44.377 --> 25:46.744
- Someone invite you to
the Valentine's dance?

25:48.080 --> 25:50.681
Look, I know you're still
hung up on Mr. Jones,

25:50.683 --> 25:52.850
but why don't you
just let it go?

25:53.986 --> 25:56.654
I don't know, go to the
dance with someone else.

25:57.757 --> 26:00.824
Hey, I have an idea: Why
don't we go together?

26:00.826 --> 26:03.227
Like the old days when we
didn't have anybody else.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.262
- That was like, seventh grade.

26:05.264 --> 26:08.465
- So?
- Thanks, but I'm fine.

26:08.467 --> 26:11.769
I probably won't be going
to the dance anyway.

26:11.771 --> 26:12.736
- Come for me.

26:13.773 --> 26:16.373
I'd like to go.

26:16.375 --> 26:19.109
- I better get to class;
I'll catch you later.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.681
- Stupid!

26:23.683 --> 26:26.083
- You know that video
could end up going viral?

26:28.020 --> 26:29.453
- That's sorta the point.

26:31.691 --> 26:33.657
- Yeah, but Mr. Jones
could get fired.

26:34.827 --> 26:37.061
- Well, if he gets
fired, it will be

26:37.063 --> 26:39.697
because he flirted
back or kissed her.

26:39.699 --> 26:41.198
His issue.

26:41.200 --> 26:44.068
- Elise, who are you going
to the dance with tomorrow?

26:44.070 --> 26:46.670
- Brett, duh.

26:46.672 --> 26:48.339
- Yeah, but surely
he won't be allowed.

26:48.341 --> 26:50.407
He's older and stuff?

26:50.409 --> 26:52.042
- Yeah, and like, what
if your mom finds out?

26:54.614 --> 26:55.813
She'll lose it.

26:55.814 --> 26:57.013
- My mom's too busy in
her own shit to notice.

26:59.552 --> 27:01.752
- Elise, got a minute?

27:02.622 --> 27:04.788
- Oh, hey Miss Drake.

27:07.493 --> 27:10.461
- Nice little setup you've
got here for tomorrow night.

27:10.463 --> 27:12.129
You all excited?
- I am!

27:12.131 --> 27:14.832
- Great, great.

27:14.834 --> 27:17.067
I just wanted to say one thing.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.869
I've been hearing that you
and your little friends

27:18.871 --> 27:21.238
have been continuously
bullying Faye.

27:24.176 --> 27:27.077
Now, I don't know what's
going on behind closed doors

27:27.079 --> 27:30.614
with your parents, but
leave her alone, okay?

27:33.886 --> 27:37.588
- Why don't you keep yourself
out of other peoples business?

27:37.590 --> 27:40.357
- I'm just saying,
if you keep this up,

27:40.359 --> 27:43.527
this little dance you've got
planned won't be happening.

27:43.529 --> 27:45.763
Listen to me, I'm
trying to help you.

28:02.281 --> 28:04.682
- Maybe we should just leave it?

28:06.252 --> 28:07.718
- Yeah, I mean, it
was a good setup,

28:07.720 --> 28:09.787
but I don't wanna
lose out on the dance.

28:11.357 --> 28:13.657
- Are you seriously
pussy-ing out on me now?

28:13.659 --> 28:15.059
- No, no, no, no!

28:15.061 --> 28:16.860
It's fine; it's up to you.

28:20.599 --> 28:21.598
- We're doing it!

28:22.835 --> 28:26.737
Besides, it's too late now.

28:28.274 --> 28:31.041
It's showtime!

28:40.920 --> 28:41.819
- Hey.

28:45.591 --> 28:47.558
- Oh, she's on the
way to his room!

28:53.766 --> 28:55.766
- How's the grading going?

28:55.768 --> 28:57.234
- Ah, great, thanks.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.969
Look, I haven't
got to yours yet,

28:58.971 --> 29:01.171
but I should be there in a few.

29:04.510 --> 29:05.309
- It's fine.

29:09.682 --> 29:12.149
- Excited for the
dance tomorrow?

29:12.151 --> 29:15.986
- Sure, it's just a bunch
of dumb teens, though.

29:22.628 --> 29:23.527
So?

29:29.335 --> 29:31.969
- It's getting late, Faye.

29:31.971 --> 29:34.571
Maybe you should--
- I was so embarrassed

29:34.573 --> 29:38.108
about this whole thing, but
I'm glad I'm here, though.

29:39.779 --> 29:41.478
- Yeah, sure.
- I knew it wasn't just me.

29:41.480 --> 29:44.915
I knew because of how
you looked at me that--

29:47.086 --> 29:49.019
- Okay, Faye--

29:51.123 --> 29:52.022
No.

29:56.896 --> 29:57.795
No.

30:07.540 --> 30:08.438
- I,

30:09.809 --> 30:11.108
I thought you liked me?

30:16.582 --> 30:17.714
I'm gonna go.

30:18.617 --> 30:19.516
- Faye!

30:22.788 --> 30:24.321
- What are you gonna
do with that shit?

30:24.323 --> 30:25.589
- Oh, I have me some plans.

30:25.591 --> 30:28.158
- Just gonna get
yourself expelled.

30:28.160 --> 30:31.361
- Oh, sorry, I didn't realize
I brought my grandma with me.

30:32.531 --> 30:34.965
Okay, here are a few
snippy snaps for you

30:34.967 --> 30:38.001
to upload onto A-4.
- Oh my god, you're terrible!

30:39.872 --> 30:43.040
- And why is that?
- Ah, sorry?

30:43.042 --> 30:44.908
- What are you up to?

30:44.910 --> 30:47.244
- Oh, we're just setting up
for the Valentine's Day Ball.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.481
I just emailed you a
set list for the music.

30:51.483 --> 30:53.183
Sorry, if you don't
wanna help us,

30:53.185 --> 30:54.985
would you mind leaving us to it?

30:54.987 --> 30:57.221
- You know, your grades
have been slipping.

30:57.223 --> 30:58.422
All of yours.

30:58.424 --> 31:01.258
So, focusing on a
school Valentine's ball

31:01.260 --> 31:03.060
should be the last
of your worries.

31:03.062 --> 31:05.162
- You know, it was
so great catching up.

31:05.164 --> 31:07.831
But we sorta don't need
this negativity in our zone.

31:14.473 --> 31:15.806
Boom!

31:15.808 --> 31:17.307
- Why would she
think that, though?

31:17.309 --> 31:19.877
That's so unlike Faye.

31:19.879 --> 31:22.112
- I have no idea.

31:22.114 --> 31:24.581
She full on went in for a kiss.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.884
- You should say something
to Principal Harper.

31:26.886 --> 31:29.286
If it gets out, you
could lose your job.

31:31.223 --> 31:32.155
- It's fine, it's fine.

31:32.157 --> 31:33.724
I mean, nothing happened.

31:35.261 --> 31:36.159
It's,

31:37.396 --> 31:39.696
I don't wanna embarrass
the kid any more.

31:39.698 --> 31:42.366
She's been through a lot,
and I guess I can come across

31:42.368 --> 31:44.835
lighter to her than I do
with the others, right?

31:46.272 --> 31:49.973
It's just, she reminds me
of myself back in school.

31:51.076 --> 31:53.810
Being the outcast, it's
not a nice feeling.

31:55.481 --> 31:57.481
I guess I come across
different with her.

31:57.483 --> 31:58.982
I don't know.

31:58.984 --> 32:01.151
- I think all the
girls have got a little crush

32:01.153 --> 32:04.655
on you, Duncan.
- Wait, what do you mean?

32:04.657 --> 32:05.956
- Stop fishing.

32:07.059 --> 32:08.125
God, man!

32:10.029 --> 32:12.462
- Wait, let me get this right.

32:12.464 --> 32:14.765
You think I'm the
school stud, right?

32:14.767 --> 32:17.668
- Oh, you walk around in some
pretty tight-fitting tops,

32:17.670 --> 32:18.969
you look after yourself.

32:20.072 --> 32:22.339
Look, stop, the girls
like you; it's obvious.

32:25.811 --> 32:29.112
- All right, so are
they the only ones?

32:29.114 --> 32:30.681
- Sorry?

32:30.683 --> 32:33.583
- I was wondering if I caught
anyone above the age of 20,

32:33.585 --> 32:35.953
but below the age of 35's eyes.

32:35.955 --> 32:38.221
- Hmm, tight age
gap in that school.

32:39.725 --> 32:41.091
- Anyone you can think of?

32:42.294 --> 32:43.860
- You're such a fool.

32:45.130 --> 32:46.163
- I guess not then.

32:47.700 --> 32:50.100
- You might've caught
the attention of someone.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.870
- Okay, okay cool.

32:58.210 --> 33:01.678
- I don't get it;
it isn't working.

33:17.663 --> 33:20.097
Summoning the Love Destroyer?

33:38.250 --> 33:42.085
- And that's how Juliet
and Romeo came to be.

33:44.656 --> 33:47.057
- Hi, I have the
Valentine's Day cards.

33:47.059 --> 33:48.625
- Sure, quick-quick.

33:52.231 --> 33:53.597
- Oh, sorry honey.

33:57.870 --> 33:59.636
Faye, even you got one!

34:04.443 --> 34:06.076
- Who do you think that's from?

34:19.690 --> 34:22.359
- And so, that's how the climax

34:22.360 --> 34:25.295
of the film came to be.

34:25.297 --> 34:28.130
Something funny with
the word climax, ladies?

34:28.132 --> 34:29.599
- Continue teaching.

34:29.601 --> 34:33.103
- Right, Elise, Britt,
carry on reading.

34:34.206 --> 34:37.306
Go for it, turn to Act
Three and start reading

34:37.309 --> 34:40.277
till the class ends.
- Sure, Act Three was it?

34:47.886 --> 34:50.286
Oh my god!

34:50.289 --> 34:51.455
What is that?

34:56.428 --> 34:57.961
- Oh my god!

34:57.963 --> 34:59.463
- Sir, is
that really appropriate

34:59.465 --> 35:01.298
to be showing in class?
- Tragic.

35:02.101 --> 35:05.435
- So tragic.

35:19.852 --> 35:22.152
- Didn't think you
could get any lower.

35:26.225 --> 35:27.124
Bye!

35:48.413 --> 35:50.313
I am cringing for you.

35:51.950 --> 35:55.152
You know, you didn't need
to stuff your bra, though.

35:56.388 --> 35:57.621
What the fuck are you doing?

36:01.026 --> 36:03.860
- Fight, fight,
fight, fight, fight!

36:10.769 --> 36:11.735
- Fuck you!

36:13.372 --> 36:15.472
- She fucking started it!

36:15.474 --> 36:19.042
- The lot of you, the
Valentine's Ball is over.

36:19.044 --> 36:20.210
No more ball!

36:21.346 --> 36:22.846
- Wait, she hit me.

36:22.848 --> 36:24.214
You're gonna let her get
away with that squat free?

36:24.216 --> 36:25.315
- No, we are not.

36:25.317 --> 36:27.117
Faye, get back here!

36:27.119 --> 36:27.951
Faye!

36:27.953 --> 36:28.885
- You know what, this?

36:28.887 --> 36:30.353
This is child abuse.

36:30.355 --> 36:32.189
I could fucking sue you for
this; my dad's a lawyer.

36:32.191 --> 36:33.190
You know that?

36:33.192 --> 36:34.724
Fuck, I broke a nail.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.059
- I can't with this girl.

37:05.824 --> 37:08.491
- For the powers that be,

37:08.493 --> 37:11.027
be present, be still.

37:13.432 --> 37:14.864
I summon thee, Death.

37:16.201 --> 37:18.134
I summon the end of love,

37:20.005 --> 37:21.071
the end of desire.

37:22.808 --> 37:24.608
I replace it with poison.

37:26.378 --> 37:27.978
With the power of my mind,

37:30.015 --> 37:31.615
take love from others

37:33.552 --> 37:35.652
as it has been taken from me.

37:38.423 --> 37:39.956
By the hand that calls,

37:41.260 --> 37:42.826
respond with a wish.

38:02.214 --> 38:05.215
- Thou has
summoned me here?

38:11.423 --> 38:12.322
- I did.

38:14.059 --> 38:18.061
- Why does thou
call me before oneself?

38:20.866 --> 38:24.567
- I want to end love.

38:24.569 --> 38:29.639
I want to grant no more love
on those within this school.

38:33.845 --> 38:36.880
- Does thou
understand the price

38:36.882 --> 38:39.182
of calling the end of love?

38:40.619 --> 38:41.518
- I do.

38:42.621 --> 38:45.055
- End of love,

38:45.057 --> 38:46.456
to love no more,

38:47.993 --> 38:50.393
to feel the feeling no more.

38:52.798 --> 38:55.265
Who does thou wish this upon?

38:58.470 --> 39:00.704
- Everyone in this school.

39:04.409 --> 39:06.042
- Thou wishes for this?

39:08.246 --> 39:09.145
- I do.

39:11.950 --> 39:15.452
- And thou
understands the consequences

39:15.454 --> 39:16.786
of ending love?

39:19.524 --> 39:21.424
- I want it destroyed.

39:23.161 --> 39:25.562
I summon you to end it.

39:27.833 --> 39:31.534
- I shall
summon a demon,

39:31.536 --> 39:33.670
a soul so banned by love,

39:35.040 --> 39:36.539
so angered by it,

39:37.909 --> 39:42.245
his force of desire to end
all love will be given.

39:44.383 --> 39:49.085
And for the 24 hours
of Valentine, love
will last no more!

39:52.524 --> 39:53.690
- I want them

39:55.394 --> 39:57.360
never to feel it again.

40:15.714 --> 40:16.780
- Faye, what are you doing?

40:18.650 --> 40:20.683
Principal Harper's
looking for you.

40:20.685 --> 40:21.584
Hey!

40:22.554 --> 40:24.788
I'm sorry about what happened.

40:24.790 --> 40:25.789
- I gotta go.

40:27.292 --> 40:28.458
- Faye!

40:28.460 --> 40:29.859
- Your behavior toward
a fellow student

40:29.861 --> 40:31.961
is absolutely disgusting.

40:31.963 --> 40:33.163
And to involve a teacher!

40:33.165 --> 40:34.697
- Can I just ask where
you have the proof

40:34.699 --> 40:37.367
that this was even me?
- Don't even try to deny it.

40:38.303 --> 40:41.237
- Okay, so I filmed a dumb girl

40:41.239 --> 40:43.206
trying it on with her teacher.

40:43.208 --> 40:44.174
So what?

40:44.176 --> 40:45.341
What is the crime in that?

40:45.343 --> 40:47.577
This is the 21st century.

40:47.579 --> 40:49.879
I have the right to film
pretty much whatever I want.

40:49.881 --> 40:51.581
Like, have you even been
on the internet lately?

40:51.583 --> 40:54.317
'Cause you can see all kinds
of crazy shit: People getting

40:54.319 --> 40:55.885
their heads cut off--
- Oh stop it!

40:55.887 --> 40:58.521
I don't want to hear
any more about this!

40:58.523 --> 41:01.157
What you have done is
completely unspeakable!

41:01.159 --> 41:02.759
I ought to expel
you on the spot.

41:02.761 --> 41:04.894
- Oh my god, go for it.

41:04.896 --> 41:06.629
You know, I wasn't even the
one who showed the video

41:06.631 --> 41:08.998
in that class; it was
Lina, for god's sake.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.533
- Your parents will be informed,

41:10.535 --> 41:12.502
and you will be personally
be staying behind tonight

41:12.504 --> 41:14.437
to take down all the
decorations in the hall.

41:14.439 --> 41:16.840
- Okay, you can't cancel
the Valentine's Day Ball,

41:16.842 --> 41:18.374
'cause tickets have
already been purchased.

41:18.376 --> 41:21.811
- And you and your friends
could organize a refund.

41:21.813 --> 41:24.781
Don't even try a
but with me, girl.

41:24.783 --> 41:28.785
Now get out of here and start
taking down those decorations.

41:28.787 --> 41:29.686
Now!

41:30.822 --> 41:33.456
- Sure, but first I've
gotta go wash my face,

41:33.458 --> 41:36.059
because thanks to you,
there's spit all over it.

41:47.706 --> 41:50.273
- Right, let's get you all
downstairs for detention.

41:50.275 --> 41:52.675
- Oh my god, you
love it, don't you?

41:52.677 --> 41:54.944
- I would really keep your
mouth closed right now.

41:54.946 --> 41:56.546
You're on thin ice.

41:58.517 --> 42:00.216
Faye, can you go
straight inside?

42:03.722 --> 42:05.321
Come on, let's go!

42:07.425 --> 42:08.491
Wait.

42:09.995 --> 42:10.894
Where's Lina?

42:11.997 --> 42:14.264
- Bathroom?
- Right.

42:26.011 --> 42:29.279
- Ho bitch.

45:23.121 --> 45:24.520
Stop, please no!

45:28.126 --> 45:32.028
- I'm gonna gloss over
the kissing incident

45:32.030 --> 45:34.530
with a member of
the teaching staff,

45:34.532 --> 45:36.899
move right along to
your other actions.

45:36.901 --> 45:38.735
You simply cannot
go around beating up

45:38.737 --> 45:41.838
on your fellow students,
whatever the provocation.

45:45.376 --> 45:48.344
Now, you will have
detention tonight.

45:50.749 --> 45:53.382
And I will call your mother
and explain the situation.

45:57.422 --> 45:58.338
- Sure.

45:58.339 --> 45:59.255
- So I'm not sure
who you were really

45:59.257 --> 46:00.823
talking to on the phone, Faye.

46:01.726 --> 46:03.159
But I'm sorry.

46:03.161 --> 46:05.027
It must've been a nasty prank.

46:05.029 --> 46:07.063
- I can assure you, the
culprit will be caught,

46:07.065 --> 46:08.765
and further action
will be taken.

46:09.634 --> 46:11.234
For now, return to your class.

46:18.276 --> 46:20.076
And you can go, as well.

46:24.115 --> 46:25.882
- Matt, what are you doing here?

46:25.884 --> 46:27.150
- I guessed you wouldn't
want to be alone,

46:27.152 --> 46:28.918
so I thought I'd
come by and help.

46:31.489 --> 46:33.623
- Matt, I don't have
you down for detention.

46:33.625 --> 46:35.758
- Ah, no, but
I wanted to help out.

46:35.760 --> 46:37.660
- Okay, sure.

46:37.662 --> 46:38.861
Group up, everyone.

46:40.965 --> 46:42.598
Right, you are all here

46:42.600 --> 46:45.401
until everything
has been taken down.

46:45.403 --> 46:47.436
- Ooh, sorry,
some of us have plans,

46:47.438 --> 46:49.205
and that would take all night.

46:49.207 --> 46:51.808
- Well, you should've thought
about that before now.

46:51.810 --> 46:55.845
Come on, let's get going; take
down the Valentine's Ball.

46:55.847 --> 46:56.746
Have fun!

46:58.082 --> 47:00.316
Oh, and if your friend
Lina doesn't show up soon,

47:00.318 --> 47:02.885
she'll be in a week's
detention when she gets back.

47:06.658 --> 47:07.924
How'd you get on?

47:07.926 --> 47:11.194
- You were right; I was
close to losing my job.

47:11.196 --> 47:13.496
I should've said something
straight away, you know?

47:13.498 --> 47:15.431
- Hey, everything's
got a silver lining.

47:15.433 --> 47:16.933
At least I don't
have to supervise

47:16.935 --> 47:19.101
a bunch of kids at
a Valentine's ball.

47:19.103 --> 47:20.803
- Look, I thought you
liked those things?

47:20.805 --> 47:22.405
- Oh, as if!

47:22.407 --> 47:25.908
I'd rather stab myself in the
face with a pencil than that.

47:27.212 --> 47:28.110
All right, what
are you doing now?

47:28.112 --> 47:29.946
Going back?
- Me?

47:29.948 --> 47:31.214
No way!

47:31.216 --> 47:33.816
Look, I've got to
mark these papers.

47:33.818 --> 47:35.885
And then summer can
officially start.

47:35.887 --> 47:38.754
- Well, let's grab
a drink after.

47:38.756 --> 47:40.256
- Second night in a row, huh?

47:40.258 --> 47:43.693
- It's Valentine's Day, and
I'd rather not be bored alone,

47:43.695 --> 47:45.862
watching some junk movie on TV,

47:45.864 --> 47:48.164
and filling my gut with crap.

47:48.166 --> 47:49.465
See you later?
- Yeah.

47:55.506 --> 47:56.973
- Ew.

47:56.975 --> 47:58.140
They look a bit burnt.

47:59.811 --> 48:00.977
- Waste not, want not.

48:02.413 --> 48:03.646
- Mm!

48:03.648 --> 48:05.147
Tastes like chicken?

48:08.286 --> 48:09.619
- Gross.

48:09.621 --> 48:10.887
- What else does
that taste like?

48:10.889 --> 48:12.622
- Chicken cookies?
- Yeah.

48:12.624 --> 48:14.190
Well, they make all
kinds of weird stuff now.

48:14.192 --> 48:16.192
You know that they
make vegan chicken

48:16.194 --> 48:18.027
that literally
looks like chicken?

48:18.029 --> 48:19.528
Why would you want it to
look and taste the same

48:19.530 --> 48:21.530
if you're not going to eat it?

48:21.532 --> 48:24.333
- Come on, girls,
let's get moving.

48:24.335 --> 48:25.434
What are you eating?

48:28.072 --> 48:30.473
This is not a hangout,
this is detention.

48:31.743 --> 48:35.544
Excuse me, this is detention,
not a social hangout.

48:35.546 --> 48:36.779
No phones!

48:36.781 --> 48:38.714
Gimme it!
- I was just texting my dad

48:38.716 --> 48:40.283
so he knew where I was.

48:40.285 --> 48:42.752
- Nice try, but Principal
Harper's already done that.

48:42.754 --> 48:43.653
Hand it over.

48:44.756 --> 48:46.722
- Yeah, you don't get
to talk to me like that.

48:48.559 --> 48:51.727
- You better not answer that.

48:55.833 --> 48:57.733
- Oh hey, what's up?

48:59.804 --> 49:01.871
- Give me that phone now!

49:01.873 --> 49:03.906
- I'll just be a sec.

49:03.908 --> 49:06.976
I'm dealing with some BS
with the temp teacher.

49:06.978 --> 49:08.778
See you soon, bye!

49:10.014 --> 49:12.381
- Where do you
think you're going?

49:12.383 --> 49:15.451
- You know, some of us
actually have things

49:15.453 --> 49:18.821
to do on Valentine's Day,
other than sit around a school,

49:18.823 --> 49:21.624
taking it out on people
because they're sad,

49:21.626 --> 49:24.226
lonely, and just a
little bit desperate.

49:25.563 --> 49:28.030
Do you think people don't
know about you and Mr. Jones?

49:30.635 --> 49:32.435
Nothing like a
broken heart, hey?

49:35.073 --> 49:36.238
Oh well.

49:38.009 --> 49:40.076
- Get back here and
clear this stuff up.

49:41.245 --> 49:42.545
- Do it yourself.

49:44.215 --> 49:45.514
- Does anyone else
wish to follow

49:45.516 --> 49:47.283
in her footsteps and
find themselves expelled

49:47.285 --> 49:49.118
when they return
from spring break?

49:51.856 --> 49:53.656
Get on with it, now!

49:56.294 --> 49:57.893
Principal Harper, hey!

49:59.097 --> 50:01.297
- What is it, Miss Drake?
- It's Elise.

50:01.299 --> 50:02.531
She stormed out of detention

50:02.533 --> 50:04.467
and she's headed
out of the school.

50:04.469 --> 50:05.968
- What, you didn't
try and stop her?

50:05.970 --> 50:08.204
- I tried; she didn't care.

50:10.174 --> 50:12.408
- I have had it up to
here with that girl!

50:19.784 --> 50:21.450
Elise!

50:21.452 --> 50:23.319
Elise, get back here!

50:23.321 --> 50:24.620
- Make me, biatch!

50:36.968 --> 50:39.301
- Where the hell do
you think you're going?

50:39.303 --> 50:41.771
- Do the hall yourself.

50:41.773 --> 50:43.773
Go!
- What's going on?

50:43.775 --> 50:44.874
- This isn't funny.

50:44.876 --> 50:46.642
Okay, go, go, go, go!

50:47.712 --> 50:52.748
I'm not kidding, go!
- Come on!

50:53.885 --> 50:55.317
I'm trying, I'm trying.
- What are you doing?

50:55.319 --> 50:58.320
Seriously.
- I'm trying, I'm trying.

50:58.322 --> 51:00.122
- Seriously, start the car.

51:01.526 --> 51:03.059
- Come on.

51:04.429 --> 51:07.696
- Get out of the car, now!

51:07.698 --> 51:09.432
- I don't care if you
fucking run him over.

51:09.434 --> 51:11.467
Just fucking go!
- Come on, come on!

51:14.372 --> 51:17.006
My car never does this.

51:28.953 --> 51:31.620
- Brett, Brett, what
the fuck is that?

51:43.901 --> 51:45.201
- Get out!
- I'm fucking trying,

51:45.203 --> 51:47.136
you idiot!

51:47.138 --> 51:48.003
Fuck!

51:53.478 --> 51:54.577
Fuck!

51:56.447 --> 51:57.413
- Come on!

52:02.687 --> 52:04.386
Elise, get in!

52:04.388 --> 52:06.322
Come on, quickly!

52:06.324 --> 52:07.823
Quicker! Come on!

52:17.301 --> 52:18.200
Guys!

52:19.570 --> 52:20.469
Guys!

52:22.607 --> 52:24.173
- Oh my god, Brett!

52:24.175 --> 52:26.876
- Get him to the
medical center, now.

52:26.878 --> 52:28.711
Go, help him; I'm
calling the cops.

52:29.747 --> 52:31.847
I'll be right behind you.

52:34.485 --> 52:35.684
Your phone.
- Miss Drake?

52:35.686 --> 52:37.586
- Give me your
phone now, please!

52:37.588 --> 52:38.487
- What happened?

52:40.358 --> 52:42.892
- What the hell is going
on? The phones don't work.

52:42.894 --> 52:44.793
- Where did this
blood come from?

52:44.795 --> 52:47.496
- Oh, ah--
- Come on, Helen.

52:47.498 --> 52:48.397
Talk to me.

52:49.367 --> 52:51.066
- I have no idea
what I just saw.

52:52.203 --> 52:53.636
- What happened?

52:53.638 --> 52:55.804
Where did this blood come from?

52:55.806 --> 52:57.673
- There's something
in here with us.

53:03.848 --> 53:05.714
- Why does no one
have any service?

53:06.751 --> 53:08.083
- Why is his blood black?

53:09.320 --> 53:12.521
Give me something,
give me something!

53:12.523 --> 53:14.490
Why is this fucking not working?

53:14.492 --> 53:17.560
Oh my god!

53:17.562 --> 53:19.028
- Elise, who did this?

53:19.030 --> 53:20.596
- You wouldn't believe
me if I told you.

53:20.598 --> 53:21.897
- Elise, come on!

53:22.934 --> 53:24.967
- Oh, calm down,
calm down, calm down.

53:24.969 --> 53:28.671
Oh, deep breaths, Elise.

53:28.673 --> 53:29.838
Okay.

53:29.840 --> 53:33.275
Okay it was

53:33.277 --> 53:35.377
he was like, flying
in the fucking air.

53:35.379 --> 53:38.113
And it had wings, and he had
weird, it was really short,

53:38.115 --> 53:40.216
really short his hair and boom.

53:40.218 --> 53:41.350
It was, oh my god.

53:42.520 --> 53:46.088
Oh, he literally. 

53:46.958 --> 53:48.357
Flying, flying!

53:51.429 --> 53:52.661
- Ah, okay.

53:52.663 --> 53:54.163
I don't know if she's in shock,

53:54.165 --> 53:55.464
or if she actually thinks
there's people flying around

53:55.466 --> 53:57.466
in the sky shooting
people with arrows.

53:59.270 --> 54:01.003
- Oh my god!

54:01.005 --> 54:03.239
I can't even.

54:03.241 --> 54:07.209
Whatever it was,
it was mad as hell.

54:08.679 --> 54:11.146
It killed Principal Harper.

54:11.148 --> 54:13.349
- Principal Harper's dead?
- Yeah, yeah!

54:13.351 --> 54:17.052
He was shot in the fucking
face with an arrow!

54:17.054 --> 54:18.687
God, you fucking idiots.

54:20.091 --> 54:22.324
Don't even fucking believe
me; this shit is serious.

54:23.527 --> 54:25.628
- Faye?

54:27.465 --> 54:29.298
Hey, what's going on?

54:30.134 --> 54:32.201
Come on, talk to me.

54:32.203 --> 54:33.836
You know something, don't you?

54:35.239 --> 54:37.339
Faye, if you talk to
me then I can help you.

54:37.341 --> 54:39.475
But I can't help if
you don't tell me.

54:41.345 --> 54:42.578
- Is he gonna be okay?

54:43.681 --> 54:47.116
That guy in there, he's
gonna be okay, right?

54:50.288 --> 54:51.420
- I'm not sure, Faye.

54:54.058 --> 54:55.524
- What's going on?

54:55.526 --> 55:00.596
Come on.

55:01.399 --> 55:02.965
Okay, come on, move over.

55:02.967 --> 55:04.600
Move over, get out.

55:06.070 --> 55:07.770
What is that?

55:07.772 --> 55:08.737
- Is it infection?

55:09.774 --> 55:11.307
- It doesn't
infect like this.

55:11.309 --> 55:13.275
- Well,
something on the arrow maybe.

55:13.277 --> 55:15.511
- There's one in his back, too.

55:15.513 --> 55:16.445
- All right, dude,

55:16.447 --> 55:18.080
I'm gonna need you to turn over.

55:18.082 --> 55:19.615
Yeah?
- All right.

55:19.617 --> 55:21.917
- Come on, just a little.

55:21.919 --> 55:23.819
There we are.

55:23.821 --> 55:28.023
Come on.

55:36.734 --> 55:37.633
Oh god!

55:38.703 --> 55:39.601
- Duncan.

55:40.738 --> 55:42.438
- Get them out of here.

55:42.440 --> 55:44.640
Get them out of here now!

55:44.642 --> 55:46.575
Come on, let me have this space.

55:46.577 --> 55:47.776
Get out of here now!

55:47.778 --> 55:49.011
- Come
on, let him have space.

55:49.013 --> 55:50.312
- Wait, he doesn't even
know what he's doing.

55:50.314 --> 55:51.347
- Elise, not now.

55:51.349 --> 55:52.548
They're trying to help.
- Get out!

56:01.959 --> 56:03.292
- What's all the commotion?

56:03.294 --> 56:05.027
What's going on?
- Miss Simmons, please,

56:05.029 --> 56:06.662
take the kids upstairs.

56:06.664 --> 56:08.464
- Come on, this way.

56:08.466 --> 56:10.666
- Let's go, come on.
- For fuck's sake.

56:18.309 --> 56:20.709
- Faye, come on, what is it?

56:21.812 --> 56:23.445
- I said nothing.
- Faye, come on.

56:23.447 --> 56:25.114
It's me you're talking to, okay?

56:25.116 --> 56:26.749
I'm on your team.

56:31.555 --> 56:33.589
- Oh shit.
- What are you thinking?

56:34.859 --> 56:36.625
- Whatever's inside
him is poison.

56:37.862 --> 56:40.162
Whatever it is,
it will kill him.

56:41.365 --> 56:44.233
It's traveling up to
his heart already.

56:44.235 --> 56:45.134
Oh shit!

56:46.137 --> 56:47.302
When it gets there,

56:48.339 --> 56:49.338
he will die.

56:50.641 --> 56:51.540
- He's gonna die?

56:56.147 --> 56:57.679
- We've gotta get outta here.

56:57.681 --> 56:59.815
Whatever that thing is,
whatever that thing was,

56:59.817 --> 57:01.316
we've gotta get out.
- Let's just wait

57:01.318 --> 57:03.519
for Miss Drake, okay?
- What's up with the bullshit?

57:03.521 --> 57:04.787
We are sitting ducks in here.

57:04.789 --> 57:07.222
- I trust Miss Drake
knows what's best.

57:07.224 --> 57:09.091
- She didn't see what I saw.

57:12.363 --> 57:13.629
- What's going on?

57:13.631 --> 57:16.565
- Just stay behind me, okay?

57:16.567 --> 57:17.800
- What good is that gonna do?

57:17.802 --> 57:19.701
You're gonna cripple
over at any point.

57:19.703 --> 57:20.702
- Who goes there?

57:21.839 --> 57:23.672
- What is that?

57:24.875 --> 57:27.109
- Something's in here with us.

57:29.280 --> 57:30.212
- Turn it off.

57:31.515 --> 57:33.782
- Something's in here with us.

57:40.291 --> 57:42.357
- You can tell me.

57:42.359 --> 57:44.526
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

57:55.473 --> 58:00.542
- Miss--

58:14.792 --> 58:17.359
- What the hell is that thing?

58:18.362 --> 58:19.294
- Cupid.

58:21.165 --> 58:23.765
- Run!

58:23.767 --> 58:25.000
- Britt, wait!

58:35.613 --> 58:36.678
- He's gone.

58:53.464 --> 58:54.863
- Just wait, no.

58:57.768 --> 58:59.635
- Ow!
- Guys, guys, hang on!

58:59.637 --> 59:00.636
Get up!

59:00.638 --> 59:02.337
Come on, get up, get up, get up!

59:04.642 --> 59:06.275
- Come on, we've gotta go!

59:06.277 --> 59:08.610
- No, I can't; I did this.

59:10.848 --> 59:12.147
- What is that?

59:14.018 --> 59:15.551
- Let's go!

59:15.553 --> 59:17.419
- Faye, get them out of here!

59:17.421 --> 59:18.353
- Come on!

59:28.866 --> 59:32.935
- Get the hell away from
me, you son of a bitch!

59:39.877 --> 59:42.444
Screw you!

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:10.105
- We need to get the
hell out of this school.

01:00:17.681 --> 01:00:20.749
- Oh
shoot, shoot, shit!

01:00:20.751 --> 01:00:22.351
Does it look messed up?

01:00:22.353 --> 01:00:23.552
- You're gonna be okay!

01:00:23.554 --> 01:00:24.820
- I'm scared, Faye!

01:00:24.822 --> 01:00:26.688
- It's just your arm
where it got you.

01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:27.623
You're gonna be okay.

01:00:27.625 --> 01:00:29.458
We just gotta stop the bleeding

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:31.727
and get this arrow out of you.

01:01:25.816 --> 01:01:27.482
- Get away from me!

01:02:15.165 --> 01:02:17.032
- What is it?

01:02:17.034 --> 01:02:19.401
You look weird; tell me.

01:02:20.471 --> 01:02:21.870
- You're fine.

01:02:21.872 --> 01:02:24.206
We just gotta get you
to the medical lab.

01:02:24.208 --> 01:02:25.340
- Why?

01:02:28.378 --> 01:02:29.945
- You're infected.

01:02:31.048 --> 01:02:32.748
Something must've
been on that arrow.

01:02:37.855 --> 01:02:40.021
- If I die tonight,

01:02:40.023 --> 01:02:41.990
I want you to know that,

01:02:44.461 --> 01:02:45.927
I sent you that card.

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:49.431
- What?

01:02:49.433 --> 01:02:50.832
- How do you still not know?

01:02:50.834 --> 01:02:53.468
After all of this time,
you still don't care.

01:02:54.905 --> 01:02:56.972
I've been into you
since the fifth grade.

01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:01.643
- Matt?
- Yeah.

01:03:01.645 --> 01:03:03.311
And when you used to sleep over,

01:03:04.114 --> 01:03:05.480
spooning wasn't an accident.

01:03:06.483 --> 01:03:08.683
- You said it was because--

01:03:08.685 --> 01:03:10.652
- Because I used to forget
that you weren't my mother.

01:03:10.654 --> 01:03:12.654
No, I knew it was you.

01:03:15.025 --> 01:03:16.758
I spooned you
'cause I wanted to.

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:22.430
What?
- I had no idea.

01:03:23.567 --> 01:03:25.100
- Yeah.

01:03:25.102 --> 01:03:26.067
I like you.

01:03:27.504 --> 01:03:29.471
- You're kinda like
my little brother.

01:03:31.809 --> 01:03:33.775
- That's a great mood killer.

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:39.781
Oh shit, what was that?

01:03:42.219 --> 01:03:43.618
- Get up.

01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:44.519
Get up!

01:04:07.811 --> 01:04:09.211
- Oh shit!

01:04:09.213 --> 01:04:11.847
Those cookies that everyone
was eating earlier.

01:04:19.857 --> 01:04:21.489
What was that?

01:04:21.491 --> 01:04:24.559
- I don't know.

01:04:51.088 --> 01:04:53.488
- Jesus, guys, you
could've warned us!

01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:55.423
Why are you creeping
up on people?

01:04:55.425 --> 01:04:56.358
- What happened?

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.093
- He was shot with an arrow.

01:04:58.095 --> 01:04:59.895
Only in his arm;
he should be fine.

01:05:01.999 --> 01:05:04.466
- We've got to get him
to the science lab.

01:05:04.468 --> 01:05:05.367
Come on!

01:05:16.013 --> 01:05:19.347
- Elise, Daryl,
you're both alive?

01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:21.917
- Don't act like you
give a rat's ass.

01:05:25.856 --> 01:05:27.155
You did this, didn't you?

01:05:28.225 --> 01:05:29.090
- What?

01:05:30.193 --> 01:05:33.028
- All of this is 'cause of you.

01:05:34.498 --> 01:05:35.397
- No.

01:05:37.167 --> 01:05:40.568
- I heard what you said to
Miss Simmons before she died.

01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:42.971
"Oh, I did this!"

01:05:42.973 --> 01:05:47.175
You really know
what's going on, don't you?

01:05:48.946 --> 01:05:50.745
That's why you look so guilty.

01:05:55.352 --> 01:05:57.552
She doesn't even have
the guts to admit it.

01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:01.289
- Yeah.

01:06:02.793 --> 01:06:03.858
Yeah, I did.

01:06:05.128 --> 01:06:05.994
It's my fault.

01:06:08.598 --> 01:06:09.564
I'm so sorry.

01:06:11.835 --> 01:06:14.436
- You summoned Cupid on us.

01:06:14.438 --> 01:06:17.072
You summoned some messed up
monster to come and kill us all.

01:06:17.074 --> 01:06:18.306
Didn't you, you freak?

01:06:22.813 --> 01:06:26.047
My boyfriend is
dead because of you.

01:06:26.049 --> 01:06:29.985
People are dropping like
flies because of you.

01:06:29.987 --> 01:06:31.653
- I'm so sorry!

01:06:31.655 --> 01:06:33.555
- Oh, oh, she's sorry.

01:06:35.192 --> 01:06:37.592
Bit late for that now, isn't it?

01:06:37.594 --> 01:06:39.694
All of my friends are
in here somewhere,

01:06:39.696 --> 01:06:41.763
and I gotta find them
before whatever the hell

01:06:41.765 --> 01:06:44.099
that messed up,
midget monster does.

01:06:45.869 --> 01:06:46.768
- Elise!

01:06:47.904 --> 01:06:49.537
Stay with us.

01:06:49.539 --> 01:06:52.340
- If I'm going down,
I'm going down fighting.

01:06:52.342 --> 01:06:54.843
Screw you bunch
of pathetic weeds.

01:07:00.384 --> 01:07:01.282
- Faye?

01:07:02.219 --> 01:07:03.318
You did this?

01:07:06.656 --> 01:07:07.989
- It doesn't matter now.

01:07:07.991 --> 01:07:09.691
We've just gotta
look after Matt.

01:07:10.794 --> 01:07:12.360
- What are you gonna do to me?

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:19.100
- Shit!

01:07:21.538 --> 01:07:24.239
Do you think Lina and
Britt got out okay?

01:07:26.543 --> 01:07:27.442
Come on.

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:38.053
- Something's not right.

01:07:58.642 --> 01:08:01.443
- Fuck, what are
you doing to me?

01:08:02.612 --> 01:08:05.213
- Trust me, you'll be
okay if you trust me.

01:08:13.023 --> 01:08:14.722
- Okay, what the hell
have you got planned?

01:08:14.724 --> 01:08:17.524
Why do you have that kid's
arm trapped in a vice?

01:08:17.527 --> 01:08:20.361
- Look, you saw what
happened to that other guy.

01:08:20.363 --> 01:08:21.229
- Right.

01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:26.768
No.

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:29.136
- We have no choice.

01:08:31.541 --> 01:08:33.006
- What's happening to me?

01:08:33.009 --> 01:08:34.876
- Mr. Jones knows
what he's doing.

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:36.010
Okay?
- Oh shit!

01:08:36.011 --> 01:08:37.946
The black shit is spreading!

01:08:37.948 --> 01:08:41.448
- When we get out of here,
I'm gonna take you on a date.

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:43.618
- What?

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:47.154
- I screwed up; I wanna
make it up to you.

01:08:47.157 --> 01:08:49.991
When we get out of here
alive, which we will,

01:08:51.261 --> 01:08:52.460
I'm gonna take you out.

01:08:54.865 --> 01:08:56.898
- I wanted to be the
one to take you out,

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:58.933
not the other way around.

01:08:58.935 --> 01:09:00.268
- 21st century, Matt.

01:09:01.438 --> 01:09:03.770
- I sure would like that.

01:09:03.773 --> 01:09:05.840
What the hell are you
doing with that thing?

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:08.408
- Look, whatever was on
the end of that arrow,

01:09:08.411 --> 01:09:10.578
it killed that boy downstairs.
- Oh fuck.

01:09:11.381 --> 01:09:13.448
Oh shit, am I gonna die?

01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:15.116
- Not if you trust me.

01:09:15.118 --> 01:09:17.051
The poison has only
spread up your arm.

01:09:17.053 --> 01:09:18.353
But it's on its
way to your heart.

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:21.122
And when it gets
there, you're done for.

01:09:21.124 --> 01:09:23.323
- I thought you were
just an English teacher?

01:09:23.326 --> 01:09:26.426
- I studied to be a doctor
before I dropped out.

01:09:26.429 --> 01:09:28.595
I couldn't be asked
to study in that debt.

01:09:29.399 --> 01:09:30.765
- I get that.

01:09:34.171 --> 01:09:35.770
- Is he joking?

01:09:35.772 --> 01:09:37.572
- Look, anyways, just listen.

01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:41.009
If you trust me, I
can save your life.

01:10:05.168 --> 01:10:06.634
- Elise, help me!

01:10:19.149 --> 01:10:20.048
No, no!

01:10:28.858 --> 01:10:30.959
- Please, please, please,
I don't wanna die!

01:10:30.961 --> 01:10:32.794
- Come on, you're gonna be okay.

01:10:32.796 --> 01:10:34.429
All right, you're gonna be fine.

01:10:34.431 --> 01:10:35.730
- Count of three.

01:10:35.732 --> 01:10:37.999
- Oh fuck, no, no!

01:10:39.803 --> 01:10:40.768
- Three.

01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:45.907
- Oh my god!

01:10:50.513 --> 01:10:52.080
Oh fuck!

01:10:56.086 --> 01:10:57.785
- Fuck, look at me.
- Oh fuck!

01:10:57.787 --> 01:10:58.853
Oh my god!

01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:03.124
- Look at me, look at
me! Matt, look at me, okay?

01:11:03.126 --> 01:11:06.728
Come on!

01:11:18.808 --> 01:11:19.707
- Faye?

01:11:22.946 --> 01:11:24.779
Are you okay?

01:11:24.781 --> 01:11:25.079
- I did this.

01:11:28.952 --> 01:11:30.685
- Faye, you're gonna
have to start talking.

01:11:30.687 --> 01:11:31.586
What did you do?

01:11:34.424 --> 01:11:35.490
- Elise was right.

01:11:36.893 --> 01:11:39.761
I was angry; I didn't
think it would work.

01:11:39.763 --> 01:11:42.063
It's just something
I do when I'm alone.

01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:49.003
- Black magic?

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:53.341
- I wanted you to like me.

01:11:55.378 --> 01:11:58.913
I did some spells; I
thought they worked,

01:11:58.915 --> 01:12:02.216
but clearly it was all
a big joke by Elise.

01:12:03.653 --> 01:12:05.520
- You cast a spell on me?

01:12:05.522 --> 01:12:07.622
- Clearly it didn't work.

01:12:10.927 --> 01:12:12.527
- What is that thing out there?

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:14.762
- Cupid.

01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:18.966
I was so humiliated
by what happened

01:12:18.968 --> 01:12:22.904
that I summoned for
the end of love to be.

01:12:24.808 --> 01:12:28.443
It worked; he was
present in the room.

01:12:28.445 --> 01:12:30.545
I don't know what he was but,

01:12:32.015 --> 01:12:33.981
he told me there
would be a price.

01:12:36.086 --> 01:12:38.219
I didn't think it would be this.

01:12:40.023 --> 01:12:41.055
I didn't want this.

01:12:42.759 --> 01:12:47.061
I just wanted them to pay
for what they did to me.

01:12:48.398 --> 01:12:51.299
- Okay, look, how
do we stop this?

01:12:54.771 --> 01:12:55.803
Faye, come on!

01:12:56.973 --> 01:13:00.174
- We have to wait until
Valentine's Day is over.

01:13:01.344 --> 01:13:03.611
Once the 24 hours is up,

01:13:04.748 --> 01:13:06.848
we'll be released from
the Curse of Cupid.

01:13:13.056 --> 01:13:15.223
- All right, look,
we're not that far off.

01:13:16.292 --> 01:13:17.959
We just gotta stay out of sight.

01:13:18.762 --> 01:13:20.061
- I'm so sorry!

01:13:21.097 --> 01:13:23.931
Please tell me
he's gonna be okay.

01:13:25.468 --> 01:13:27.235
Please?
- Faye, we need

01:13:27.237 --> 01:13:31.672
to get those towels;
he's gonna be fine, okay?

01:13:31.674 --> 01:13:34.409
Just as soon as this is
over, we're gonna get him out

01:13:34.411 --> 01:13:36.344
of here and to a hospital.

01:13:38.982 --> 01:13:39.881
All right?

01:13:45.989 --> 01:13:47.288
Stay with him, okay?

01:13:48.691 --> 01:13:50.291
I'll be right back.

01:13:50.293 --> 01:13:51.559
- Do not say that.

01:13:57.434 --> 01:13:59.667
Just say, I'll see you in a bit.

01:13:59.669 --> 01:14:02.370
Okay, 'cause you
will, see me in a bit.

01:14:02.372 --> 01:14:04.872
Now, when you do,
you're gonna buy me

01:14:04.874 --> 01:14:06.707
one hell of a strong drink.
- Yeah.

01:14:17.921 --> 01:14:20.488
- It's fine, I'm so over this.

01:14:23.159 --> 01:14:24.158
- Let's go.

01:15:13.276 --> 01:15:17.278
- Damn, no!

01:15:19.315 --> 01:15:20.214
- Elise!

01:15:21.885 --> 01:15:23.184
- Wait, go, go, go! He's coming!

01:15:23.186 --> 01:15:24.418
He's coming!

01:15:26.356 --> 01:15:27.889
- You're
doing great okay?

01:15:27.891 --> 01:15:30.024
- I feel fucked.

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:31.158
- It's nearly over.

01:16:02.492 --> 01:16:03.391
- You happy now?

01:16:04.227 --> 01:16:05.726
You got what you wanted?

01:16:05.728 --> 01:16:08.362
- This isn't what I wanted.
- Really?

01:16:08.364 --> 01:16:10.698
Sure seems like it fucking is!

01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:12.767
My friends are dead.

01:16:12.769 --> 01:16:14.135
Did you know that?

01:16:14.137 --> 01:16:16.804
Lina, Britt,

01:16:16.806 --> 01:16:21.876
Daryl, my boyfriend, are
all dead because of you.

01:16:22.478 --> 01:16:23.878
- I'm so sorry!

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:26.380
- You know, your
mom steals my dad

01:16:26.382 --> 01:16:29.817
and then you steal
everything else I care about!

01:16:29.819 --> 01:16:31.953
If your mom had just
kept her legs closed

01:16:31.955 --> 01:16:33.621
then I would've never
hated you this much.

01:16:33.623 --> 01:16:35.456
And none of this
would've happened.

01:16:37.827 --> 01:16:39.060
- Let's go.

01:16:42.065 --> 01:16:45.933
Helen!

01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:48.736
- This is on you.

01:17:02.085 --> 01:17:02.984
- Help me.

01:17:04.754 --> 01:17:06.354
- Helen, you're gonna be okay.

01:17:06.356 --> 01:17:07.922
Just stay calm, okay?

01:17:08.758 --> 01:17:09.657
Stay calm.

01:17:14.631 --> 01:17:17.465
- The kingdom below,
the kingdom before,

01:17:17.467 --> 01:17:20.568
make him rise, make him present.

01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:23.838
Be it he stands before,
be it he stands behind.

01:17:24.874 --> 01:17:27.875
Be it his presence
comes forth; be present.

01:17:30.913 --> 01:17:31.812
Don't look!

01:17:32.882 --> 01:17:34.281
It says if you look
him in the eyes,

01:17:34.283 --> 01:17:35.549
your soul will be taken.

01:17:43.493 --> 01:17:46.060
- Thou dare summon me?

01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:50.931
Why?
- I want this to stop.

01:17:54.771 --> 01:17:56.904
This isn't what I wanted.

01:17:58.007 --> 01:18:00.941
- Thou knew
the consequences.

01:18:00.943 --> 01:18:02.443
- No,

01:18:02.445 --> 01:18:04.879
I didn't know it would be this.

01:18:04.881 --> 01:18:08.215
I was angry and mad.

01:18:08.217 --> 01:18:09.417
I messed up and,

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:12.219
I didn't realize it
would result in this.

01:18:12.221 --> 01:18:16.490
- Thou must wait
out the 24-hour curse.

01:18:16.492 --> 01:18:17.391
- Or what?

01:18:18.728 --> 01:18:20.528
What happens if I don't?

01:18:22.498 --> 01:18:24.999
- Thou has no choice.

01:18:25.835 --> 01:18:28.235
- What if I want it to end now?

01:18:29.238 --> 01:18:30.971
- A sacrifice
must be made.

01:18:47.957 --> 01:18:49.990
- Faye, don't do it.

01:18:49.992 --> 01:18:52.093
We have two minutes
on the clock.

01:18:52.095 --> 01:18:55.563
- Two minutes is
enough to finish everyone

01:18:55.565 --> 01:18:59.066
within this room.
- Don't do this, please!

01:19:00.203 --> 01:19:02.803
- Give up thou'st life,

01:19:02.805 --> 01:19:05.473
or thou curse to be fulfilled.

01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:15.199
- No!

01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:16.149
- I looked, oh fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:19:16.152 --> 01:19:18.419
I looked, I looked,
I looked!

01:19:36.038 --> 01:19:37.838
What are you?
- Death.

01:19:50.052 --> 01:19:51.018
- Oh god.

01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:53.621
- It's midnight.

01:20:02.899 --> 01:20:04.365
- Don't look!
- Don't look!

01:20:04.367 --> 01:20:06.100
- It's dark in here.

01:20:11.307 --> 01:20:12.373
- It's done.

to come kill us all; I
think the drinks are on you.

We need to get
you to a hospital.

behind you, Matt.

01:21:28.150 --> 01:21:30.251

doing with that thing?

01:21:30.253 --> 01:21:31.619
- Nothing.

01:21:31.621 --> 01:21:34.321
Nothing ever again.

01:21:38.794 --> 01:21:39.693
For everything.

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:53.407
Mr. Jones, what are you doing?

01:21:55.278 --> 01:21:56.143
- Holy shit.

01:21:57.513 --> 01:21:58.846

Your love spells.
- Oh shit!

01:22:04.587 --> 01:22:06.687
- You better have a
spell to sort this out.
