01:04.754 --> 01:06.939
Hey, where are you guys?

01:06.963 --> 01:08.113
Oh, we left.

01:08.137 --> 01:09.493
What?
Yeah.

01:09.517 --> 01:12.427
Lame. That party was amazing.
Hey, miss?

01:12.451 --> 01:15.741
Yeah, it was just okay...

01:15.765 --> 01:17.939
Help, please.

01:21.840 --> 01:23.645
Are you okay?

01:35.060 --> 01:38.281
Sarah? Sarah?

01:46.106 --> 01:48.325
Hello? Sarah?

01:48.349 --> 01:51.570
Talk to me, what's going on?

01:51.594 --> 01:53.320
Sarah?

04:52.153 --> 04:53.441
Oh!
Go, go, go!

04:53.465 --> 04:54.822
Come on, come on,
come on, come on...

04:54.846 --> 04:56.341
Go, go, go, go!

04:56.365 --> 04:58.308
Oh, my gosh, you did that
and you're in dress shoes.

04:58.332 --> 04:59.965
That's right, I am.

04:59.989 --> 05:01.898
So, where's your skills?
Come on.

05:01.922 --> 05:04.625
Come on, buddy!

05:04.649 --> 05:05.833
Your goal!

05:05.857 --> 05:09.423
Goal! Whoo!

05:09.447 --> 05:10.527
Nope.

05:10.551 --> 05:11.390
No, no.

05:11.414 --> 05:12.933
Come on, come on, buddy.

05:15.176 --> 05:16.671
I gotta be a goalie, okay?

05:16.695 --> 05:17.845
Ah!

05:21.528 --> 05:22.470
Come on, man!

05:22.494 --> 05:23.851
Come on, what's with you?

05:23.875 --> 05:26.671
I'm the doctor,
you're the soccer player.

05:32.090 --> 05:34.195
Ah!

05:35.024 --> 05:36.001
Goal!

05:36.025 --> 05:37.036
Oh, you kicked me!

05:37.060 --> 05:38.348
Hey, low blow!

05:38.372 --> 05:40.868
Tickle monster ensues!

05:40.892 --> 05:42.145
It's a ticklish spider!

05:42.169 --> 05:43.180
Oh, hold on, buddy.

05:45.621 --> 05:47.978
Hey, Dr. Konrad.

05:48.002 --> 05:50.049
Uh-huh.

05:50.073 --> 05:52.569
How are his vitals?

05:52.593 --> 05:54.260
Yeah, and what's the...?
Can we play?

05:54.284 --> 05:57.816
What's the CT scan show?

05:57.840 --> 05:59.921
All right, I'll be there in 20.

05:59.945 --> 06:01.992
Let's fly, buddy.

06:02.016 --> 06:03.269
Already?

06:03.293 --> 06:04.857
Hey, you know how it goes.

06:04.881 --> 06:06.814
It's an emergency
and I'm on call, let's go.

06:10.473 --> 06:11.647
Pack it up.

06:22.658 --> 06:23.911
Come on, buddy.

06:23.935 --> 06:27.086
I'm sorry.

06:27.110 --> 06:29.054
You're always sorry.

06:29.078 --> 06:31.367
Look, it was
getting dark anyway.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.496
Couldn't play that much longer.

06:42.056 --> 06:44.069
I just...

06:44.093 --> 06:45.474
miss you, Dad.

06:51.790 --> 06:53.285
Hey...

06:53.309 --> 06:54.655
you wanna see something scary?

06:56.726 --> 06:57.979
Yeah.

06:58.003 --> 07:00.879
Okay, here goes, ready?

07:00.903 --> 07:02.605
Three, two,

07:02.629 --> 07:03.985
one.

07:04.009 --> 07:05.262
Whoa!

07:06.356 --> 07:07.541
Again, again!

07:07.565 --> 07:09.301
Oh, come on.

07:09.325 --> 07:11.614
I would highly advise
against that, Captain.

07:11.638 --> 07:13.926
Override protocol.

07:13.950 --> 07:15.745
Copy that, over.

07:17.609 --> 07:19.760
One, two,

07:19.784 --> 07:23.073
three, four,

07:23.097 --> 07:25.800
five, six,

07:25.824 --> 07:28.527
seven, eight,

07:28.551 --> 07:29.873
nine,

07:29.897 --> 07:31.012
ten.

07:32.659 --> 07:35.672
Do 20 now!
Oh, let's not get carried away.

07:35.696 --> 07:37.881
Okay.

07:37.905 --> 07:39.193
Thanks, Dad.

07:39.217 --> 07:40.598
That was fun.

07:43.048 --> 07:44.647
So how are things at school?

07:44.671 --> 07:46.994
You got a girlfriend now, right?

07:47.018 --> 07:48.858
Dad! That's gross.

07:48.882 --> 07:49.848
What's her name, Irma?

07:51.574 --> 07:53.518
Shit!
Dad, watch out!

07:53.542 --> 07:54.715
Hold on!

08:06.624 --> 08:08.591
John, can you hear me?

08:11.180 --> 08:13.562
It's okay, baby, it's me, Chloe.

08:19.809 --> 08:20.810
Nurse!

08:25.435 --> 08:27.759
How long have I been out?

08:27.783 --> 08:29.681
Two days.

08:32.028 --> 08:34.041
Brian...

08:34.065 --> 08:36.376
Brian, is he all right?

08:41.381 --> 08:44.085
Oh, God, no, oh, God, no.

08:44.109 --> 08:46.743
Oh, God, please.

08:46.767 --> 08:48.355
No, not dead.

08:53.015 --> 08:54.337
No!

08:54.361 --> 08:56.201
Oh, what's happening?

08:56.225 --> 08:58.710
Somebody help!

09:02.956 --> 09:04.002
Describe what you're feeling.

09:07.167 --> 09:08.627
Call Dr. Konrad!

09:09.859 --> 09:12.044
This will help.

09:12.068 --> 09:13.563
Just breathe,
just breathe, relax.

09:13.587 --> 09:15.531
John, John.
What's happening to me?

09:15.555 --> 09:17.360
What's going on?
I don't know, he was coming to

09:17.384 --> 09:18.913
when we were talking and then
something got triggered.

09:18.937 --> 09:20.328
It happened quickly.

09:20.352 --> 09:22.020
Do something, anything!
I did.

09:22.044 --> 09:24.125
Please!
Morphine, five milligrams.

09:24.149 --> 09:25.506
And then nothing?
Nothing.

09:25.530 --> 09:28.026
All right, give me
a hundred of the ketamine

09:28.050 --> 09:29.786
in one of the verse.
Dr. Konrad...

09:29.810 --> 09:30.811
Do it!

09:33.055 --> 09:35.033
He should be knocked out by now.

09:36.990 --> 09:38.933
Again.

09:38.957 --> 09:40.625
Dr. Konrad...
Do it!

09:40.649 --> 09:41.833
Okay.

09:41.857 --> 09:43.282
I can't, I can't.

09:43.306 --> 09:45.008
I'm sorry...
I'll do it.

09:45.032 --> 09:47.563
...I'm sorry!
Chloe, you don't work here anymore.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.565
Step back.

09:51.383 --> 09:53.776
It's okay, baby, just breathe.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.180
Just...

11:16.158 --> 11:18.550
From a medical standpoint,
all the reports and tests

11:18.574 --> 11:20.794
come to the same conclusion,

11:20.818 --> 11:24.901
that there's nothing
physically wrong with you.

11:24.925 --> 11:29.526
I mean, we just can't seem
to find the source of the pain.

11:29.550 --> 11:34.359
And, quite frankly, I've never
seen anything like this before.

11:34.383 --> 11:36.154
I mean, I personally consulted

11:36.178 --> 11:37.431
with dozens of experts...

11:37.455 --> 11:40.848
I don't care
about other doctors,

11:40.872 --> 11:42.563
what's your opinion?

11:45.601 --> 11:51.238
That you've suffered
a traumatic shock...

11:51.262 --> 11:56.519
both emotionally
and psychologically.

11:56.543 --> 11:59.280
And that...

11:59.304 --> 12:02.732
this is just your body's way
of dealing with the pain.

12:02.756 --> 12:05.079
Could it be a form of
post-traumatic stress?

12:05.103 --> 12:07.772
It doesn't fit the diagnosis.

12:07.796 --> 12:10.015
You both know as well
as I do that there are

12:10.039 --> 12:12.766
new orphan diseases every day.

12:14.147 --> 12:15.987
Parkinson's?

12:16.011 --> 12:18.817
It doesn't explain the pain.

12:18.841 --> 12:21.578
John, we've given you
every painkiller and sedative

12:21.602 --> 12:23.063
known to man and you're just...

12:23.087 --> 12:24.882
You're not responding.

12:26.884 --> 12:28.965
So, if you want my...

12:28.989 --> 12:33.659
professional opinion...

12:33.683 --> 12:34.695
go home.

12:34.719 --> 12:38.216
Rest.

12:38.240 --> 12:39.217
And with everything

12:39.241 --> 12:42.392
that's happened...

12:42.416 --> 12:44.487
talk to each other.

13:46.515 --> 13:47.723
John...

13:50.968 --> 13:52.832
What are you doing?

13:57.077 --> 14:00.805
Why are you putting him
away like that?

14:59.277 --> 15:00.623
Thank you for coming.

15:02.591 --> 15:03.799
Thank you.

15:07.768 --> 15:09.574
I'm so sorry for your loss.

15:09.598 --> 15:11.093
Thank you.

15:11.117 --> 15:13.371
John, can I speak to you
for a minute?

15:13.395 --> 15:15.097
I'm sorry, do I know you?

15:15.121 --> 15:18.341
My name is Herb Morris.

15:18.365 --> 15:21.034
A friend of mine told me
about your situation

15:21.058 --> 15:23.381
who works in the medical field.

15:23.405 --> 15:27.350
Dr. Konrad consulted with him
regarding your condition.

15:27.374 --> 15:28.938
He wouldn't have told me

15:28.962 --> 15:32.804
about your situation
if he didn't think I could help.

15:32.828 --> 15:35.279
And I can help, John.

15:39.352 --> 15:40.985
Look, I...
don't have time for this.

15:41.009 --> 15:42.331
John...

15:42.355 --> 15:45.058
I understand
you've been through so much

15:45.082 --> 15:47.301
and you have a long road ahead.

15:47.325 --> 15:49.234
Let me give you my card

15:49.258 --> 15:51.881
and you call me
when you're ready.

15:53.711 --> 15:54.781
Ready?

15:56.231 --> 15:57.611
You'll know.

16:01.926 --> 16:03.731
Who was that?

16:03.755 --> 16:05.078
No one.

16:05.102 --> 16:08.322
Just some ambulance chaser.

17:28.288 --> 17:30.991
Do you want some help?
No.

17:31.015 --> 17:33.880
I can do it.

17:36.676 --> 17:38.378
John?

17:38.402 --> 17:39.610
Yeah?

17:41.888 --> 17:43.269
We should talk.

17:46.375 --> 17:48.170
What do you wanna talk about?

17:52.347 --> 17:54.521
Our son died, John.

18:00.148 --> 18:01.125
It wasn't your fault.

18:01.149 --> 18:02.126
Don't say that, okay?

18:02.150 --> 18:03.679
You... you weren't there,

18:03.703 --> 18:06.440
I was there, I was driving,
this was my fault.

18:06.464 --> 18:08.684
You have to stop blaming
yourself, you can't live...

18:08.708 --> 18:10.617
You call this living?

18:10.641 --> 18:12.239
Oh.

18:48.196 --> 18:49.345
Here, give me this.

21:00.707 --> 21:02.271
John!

21:02.295 --> 21:05.264
John! What did you do?

21:08.025 --> 21:10.521
What did you do?
Hey, hey, shh.

21:10.545 --> 21:11.384
Hey.

21:11.408 --> 21:13.410
It's not what you think.

21:22.211 --> 21:24.707
You're not shaking anymore.

21:24.731 --> 21:27.320
The pain is gone, Chloe.

22:16.404 --> 22:18.313
This is John Clarke.

22:18.337 --> 22:21.454
Said you had some information
about my condition.

22:21.478 --> 22:23.732
I'm ready to hear it.

22:40.600 --> 22:45.270
What you have is an extremely
rare version of PTSD,

22:45.294 --> 22:48.757
and by rare I mean
one in a million.

22:48.781 --> 22:51.725
Now there are theories,
but, in the end,

22:51.749 --> 22:57.075
nobody's been able to figure out
exactly what this is.

22:57.099 --> 22:58.767
Is there a cure?

22:58.791 --> 23:00.078
A cure? No.

23:00.102 --> 23:02.667
Barely a palliative.

23:02.691 --> 23:04.531
Just by looking at you,
I can tell

23:04.555 --> 23:06.799
that you've already
discovered it for yourself.

23:09.008 --> 23:11.296
You drank your own blood...

23:11.320 --> 23:14.714
and the pain went away.

23:14.738 --> 23:17.061
I know what
you're going through, John,

23:17.085 --> 23:18.580
believe me I do.

23:18.604 --> 23:20.409
This is insane.

23:20.433 --> 23:22.998
So, what, I just drink my own blood now...?
Whoa, whoa, whoa no, no,

23:23.022 --> 23:24.586
not so fast there, champ.

23:24.610 --> 23:28.555
For some reason, that particular
cure only works the once.

23:28.579 --> 23:31.662
I don't know, maybe to
give you a taste for it.

23:31.686 --> 23:36.356
I can assure you,
you continue down that route...

23:36.380 --> 23:38.900
you won't last very long,
if you know what I mean.

23:42.697 --> 23:46.711
What, am I like a...
vampire now or something?

23:46.735 --> 23:49.473
What's happening to you
is very real.

23:49.497 --> 23:53.062
Now, I can assure you
you're not gonna live forever,

23:53.086 --> 23:55.064
you can still go out
and enjoy the sun,

23:55.088 --> 23:56.894
you can have garlic
on your steak,

23:56.918 --> 23:59.862
hell, you can even enjoy
your good looks in the mirror

23:59.886 --> 24:02.865
when you wake up in the morning.

24:02.889 --> 24:06.524
All that shit is just myth.

24:06.548 --> 24:08.930
But the core of it is true.

24:10.725 --> 24:12.254
It's blood.

24:12.278 --> 24:15.222
Blood eases the pain.

24:15.246 --> 24:17.224
Fresh human blood,

24:17.248 --> 24:18.502
animal blood doesn't work,

24:18.526 --> 24:21.194
old, stale blood doesn't work.

24:21.218 --> 24:22.644
Mother nature knows best.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.568
Yeah, you find this natural?

24:28.708 --> 24:33.033
Good news is...
Is I can get you what you need.

24:33.057 --> 24:35.829
Are you offering
to sell me blood?

24:35.853 --> 24:37.244
Think about it, John.

24:37.268 --> 24:40.731
You can have your life back

24:40.755 --> 24:43.723
and nobody need ever know.

26:50.678 --> 26:51.851
Oh, fuck!

27:12.078 --> 27:13.632
Just gonna change this
out for you.

28:11.759 --> 28:12.805
Where were you?

28:12.829 --> 28:14.082
I've been calling.

28:14.106 --> 28:17.223
Oh, sorry,
I... lost track of time.

28:17.247 --> 28:18.431
Are you okay?

28:18.455 --> 28:22.746
Yeah, yeah, I'm all right.

28:22.770 --> 28:24.392
And the pain?

28:25.945 --> 28:27.923
It's gone.

28:27.947 --> 28:29.856
But how?

28:29.880 --> 28:31.202
I mean, you've been sick

28:31.226 --> 28:33.066
for days and then,
just like that,

28:33.090 --> 28:34.274
it's gone?

28:34.298 --> 28:35.506
Did you call Gail?

28:38.095 --> 28:39.348
Don't get me wrong,

28:39.372 --> 28:40.695
I'm glad that
you're feeling better,

28:40.719 --> 28:43.559
but... there has to be
some kind of explanation

28:43.583 --> 28:46.459
otherwise it could
just come back.

28:46.483 --> 28:49.565
Hey...

28:49.589 --> 28:52.085
I'll be fine.

28:52.109 --> 28:56.400
Just please give me some time.

28:56.424 --> 28:57.736
Okay?

29:33.012 --> 29:34.807
Gail, it's Chloe.

29:39.916 --> 29:41.617
Urban legend Carla Franken

29:41.641 --> 29:43.585
was found dead today
in her prison cell

29:43.609 --> 29:45.518
where she was awaiting trial.

29:45.542 --> 29:49.177
Police sources say she committed
suicide by hanging herself.

29:49.201 --> 29:51.558
Ms. Franken was arrested
earlier this year

29:51.582 --> 29:55.390
for the alleged killing of
24-year-old Sarah Mendelsohn.

29:55.414 --> 29:57.564
Unofficial sources at that time

29:57.588 --> 30:00.188
claimed that Ms. Franken
had drank the blood

30:00.212 --> 30:01.672
of her alleged victim,

30:01.696 --> 30:03.812
which sparked
a series of tabloid rumors

30:03.836 --> 30:07.505
that labeled her as the "Charles
County Vampire Killer."

30:07.529 --> 30:10.646
Official sources
strongly denied those rumors.

30:10.670 --> 30:12.717
Ms. Franken had been troubled
for many years

30:12.741 --> 30:15.548
after her entire family died
in a house fire

30:15.572 --> 30:17.446
that she inadvertently started.

30:17.470 --> 30:19.207
Gail wants to see you
in an hour.

30:20.749 --> 30:22.969
Oh, uh, right.

30:22.993 --> 30:24.522
Great.

30:24.546 --> 30:26.076
Thank you.

30:26.100 --> 30:28.585
What were you looking at?

30:30.967 --> 30:32.554
Nothing.

30:33.797 --> 30:35.454
Okay.

30:41.598 --> 30:44.404
Rapid response team to room 453.

30:44.428 --> 30:47.673
Rapid response team, room 453.

30:54.093 --> 30:57.038
Dr. Barnett,
please dial 115.

30:57.062 --> 30:59.236
Dr. Barnett, 115.

31:14.734 --> 31:16.229
You wanna be reinstated?

31:16.253 --> 31:18.024
Pain's gone, Gail.

31:18.048 --> 31:19.681
It's over.

31:19.705 --> 31:21.338
Over just like that?

31:21.362 --> 31:22.546
I guess you were right,

31:22.570 --> 31:24.928
it must've been psychological.

31:24.952 --> 31:28.069
I have no other
explanation for it.

31:28.093 --> 31:30.036
It's only been a couple of days.

31:30.060 --> 31:33.729
I... did you start seeing anyone?

31:33.753 --> 31:37.009
I talked it over with Chloe
like you suggested

31:37.033 --> 31:40.243
and it really helped.

31:41.727 --> 31:42.946
Uh-huh.

31:42.970 --> 31:44.740
Well, I wanna start
monitoring you

31:44.764 --> 31:45.983
on a daily basis.

31:46.007 --> 31:48.779
And you can
when I resume working.

31:48.803 --> 31:52.289
I'll be here,
you can keep your eye on me.

31:53.532 --> 31:55.130
John, don't you think
it's a bit too soon?

31:55.154 --> 31:56.500
I can do it.

31:58.709 --> 31:59.918
See?

32:03.369 --> 32:05.244
What happened to the other hand?

32:05.268 --> 32:07.798
I... I tried to do
some home improvements,

32:07.822 --> 32:10.732
the shaking relapsed
for like a second when I did.

32:10.756 --> 32:12.561
Mm-hmm.

32:12.585 --> 32:15.116
And what happens when
it relapses during a surgery?

32:15.140 --> 32:18.084
Look, I knew you would say that,

32:18.108 --> 32:20.052
and you know that
I would never risk

32:20.076 --> 32:23.296
endangering a patient's life,

32:23.320 --> 32:25.195
so I'm not asking you
to put me back into surgery

32:25.219 --> 32:26.921
on my own at first.

32:26.945 --> 32:30.200
Let me assist for a while.

32:30.224 --> 32:32.029
I'll be at the hospital,

32:32.053 --> 32:33.237
I'll get back into my rhythm...

32:33.261 --> 32:35.999
John, we don't
need you to assist

32:36.023 --> 32:37.586
on somebody else's surgery.

32:37.610 --> 32:41.211
I need it, Gail.

32:41.235 --> 32:44.869
I need to feel useful again.

32:44.893 --> 32:46.009
You know me.

32:46.033 --> 32:49.460
My whole life is my work.

32:49.484 --> 32:52.118
You don't even have to
put me back on payroll again.

32:52.142 --> 32:54.627
You're being ridiculous.

32:56.871 --> 32:58.883
When my mother died,

32:58.907 --> 33:01.265
all I could think about
was getting back to work

33:01.289 --> 33:05.614
and staying at work.

33:05.638 --> 33:07.962
All I wanted to do was just...

33:07.986 --> 33:09.549
do anything to just...

33:11.990 --> 33:13.784
...stop thinking
about her all the time.

33:19.273 --> 33:23.287
And stop thinking
about the guilt...

33:23.311 --> 33:27.878
and the shame.

33:27.902 --> 33:30.767
Stop thinking about the pain.

33:33.080 --> 33:36.783
I wanna help you, John.

33:36.807 --> 33:38.613
I do.

33:38.637 --> 33:41.364
But this help comes
with a warning.

33:44.436 --> 33:47.760
I'm gonna watch you
very carefully.

33:47.784 --> 33:51.074
And the moment there's any
sign of trouble, you are out.

33:51.098 --> 33:52.478
Sure.

34:01.970 --> 34:03.258
You can start next week,

34:03.282 --> 34:07.021
Dr. Eubanks...
I wanna start today.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.885
Immediately.

35:26.331 --> 35:27.884
I'll take care of that.

35:43.348 --> 35:45.395
John, listen, what are you
doing in the dark?

35:45.419 --> 35:46.627
I...

35:53.737 --> 35:55.705
What's going on?

35:58.501 --> 35:59.709
John?

36:02.988 --> 36:05.508
Just... talk to me.

36:08.752 --> 36:11.006
You're scaring me.

36:11.030 --> 36:12.411
Just...

36:15.897 --> 36:18.452
...tell me what's going on.

36:20.833 --> 36:22.017
I'm here to help.

36:22.041 --> 36:24.399
I just wanna...

36:24.423 --> 36:25.814
I just wanna help.
John, don't leave!

36:25.838 --> 36:27.288
John!

36:32.328 --> 36:34.709
Jesus Christ.

36:51.450 --> 36:52.807
Whoa.

36:52.831 --> 36:54.291
Would you look at this?

36:54.315 --> 36:56.845
Junkie doctor.

36:56.869 --> 36:59.572
Never thought I'd see the day.

36:59.596 --> 37:01.091
Look like you need a fix, doc.

37:01.115 --> 37:02.644
Maybe I can help you.

37:02.668 --> 37:04.128
Hook you up.

37:04.152 --> 37:05.440
You want some morphine?
No.

37:05.464 --> 37:07.259
Some crystal?
Fuck off, will you?

37:10.089 --> 37:13.345
Whoa, doc, you off your meds?

37:13.369 --> 37:17.141
Wallet now.
I don't have anything on me.

37:17.165 --> 37:18.246
I'm not taking your word for it.

37:18.270 --> 37:20.144
Your night's not tonight!

37:20.168 --> 37:21.353
What the fuck, man?

37:52.339 --> 37:54.765
Dude, you fucking stabbed me!

37:54.789 --> 37:57.309
You did that yourself.

38:00.761 --> 38:03.360
Why are you staring
at me like that?

38:03.384 --> 38:05.776
You're fucking
creeping me out, man.

38:05.800 --> 38:07.399
Do something!

38:07.423 --> 38:09.504
You're a fucking doctor,
for fuck's sake, come on!

38:09.528 --> 38:12.428
I'm bleeding out here, man!

38:15.016 --> 38:16.270
Hey, where are you going?

38:16.294 --> 38:17.478
The ER's right in there.

38:17.502 --> 38:19.342
Help me!

38:19.366 --> 38:22.265
You're seriously gonna
leave me like this?

38:49.844 --> 38:51.270
What are you doing?

38:51.294 --> 38:53.652
You went back to work?

38:53.676 --> 38:55.032
What happened?

38:55.056 --> 38:58.415
Oh... relapse.

38:58.439 --> 39:00.683
I dropped some blood samples.

39:04.549 --> 39:06.240
The pain's back?

39:08.276 --> 39:11.176
It's okay, honey, I'm here.

39:16.975 --> 39:18.356
Arms up.

39:30.195 --> 39:31.655
I'm here.

39:31.679 --> 39:32.853
Thank you.

39:34.786 --> 39:36.902
We'll get through this.

39:36.926 --> 39:38.455
It's gonna be okay.

39:48.075 --> 39:49.293
What? What happened?

39:49.317 --> 39:50.433
Stay away from me.

39:50.457 --> 39:51.813
I don't wanna hurt you.

39:51.837 --> 39:53.470
What? What's wrong?

39:53.494 --> 39:56.197
You don't understand,
I'm a danger to people,

39:56.221 --> 39:57.405
I'm a danger to you.

39:57.429 --> 39:58.751
What are you talking about?

39:58.775 --> 39:59.787
I need to go!

39:59.811 --> 40:03.228
John, stop!

40:06.300 --> 40:08.682
You're not the only one
who lost Brian.

40:12.513 --> 40:14.239
I need you.

40:17.967 --> 40:19.220
Please.

40:19.244 --> 40:21.177
I'm sorry.

41:21.409 --> 41:22.790
Hey, thanks, Herb.

41:42.223 --> 41:45.226
John, welcome.

41:46.849 --> 41:49.161
Take a seat, I won't be long.

42:15.360 --> 42:17.787
Here, this should help.

42:17.811 --> 42:19.409
Careful.

42:19.433 --> 42:20.917
Don't spill on the rug.

42:30.513 --> 42:32.619
Cheers.

42:34.068 --> 42:35.483
You have it too?

42:38.659 --> 42:40.326
But your skin.

42:40.350 --> 42:42.905
Pale skin's bad for business.

42:46.287 --> 42:48.818
Are there many others like us?

42:48.842 --> 42:53.132
Worldwide, a few hundred maybe.

42:53.156 --> 42:56.170
Around here, barely a handful.

42:56.194 --> 42:59.069
And... and you know them all?

42:59.093 --> 43:01.209
I like to think I do.

43:01.233 --> 43:03.833
I heard about this woman,
Carla Franken...

43:03.857 --> 43:05.075
Oh...

43:05.099 --> 43:06.974
Was she one of us too?

43:06.998 --> 43:09.666
Well, I guess you could say so.

43:09.690 --> 43:13.083
Not one of the smart ones,
if you ask me.

43:13.107 --> 43:16.421
She paid the price
for her recklessness.

43:18.147 --> 43:19.400
Where'd you get this?

43:19.424 --> 43:21.333
I mean,
I've tried blood banks, but...

43:21.357 --> 43:23.231
You're a smart man, John,

43:23.255 --> 43:25.130
but you're gonna
have to adjust your notions

43:25.154 --> 43:27.373
of good and evil.

43:27.397 --> 43:30.135
You'll come to
understand that grey

43:30.159 --> 43:32.102
is a fine color after all,

43:32.126 --> 43:34.542
good for all seasons.

43:36.303 --> 43:38.857
Did you kill for it?

43:40.031 --> 43:42.171
Not my style.

43:47.348 --> 43:50.431
You like what you see, hmm?

43:50.455 --> 43:52.951
You can have
your life back, John.

43:52.975 --> 43:55.529
You can have control.

44:04.607 --> 44:07.610
Would you like me to show you?

44:11.476 --> 44:12.650
Come in.

44:14.548 --> 44:15.836
Hey, Gail, do you have a minute?

44:15.860 --> 44:20.288
Chloe, uh... yeah.

44:20.312 --> 44:21.531
In fact, I was...

44:21.555 --> 44:23.913
actually planning to call you.

44:23.937 --> 44:26.018
How are you doing?

44:26.042 --> 44:28.193
I'm keeping it together.

44:28.217 --> 44:30.436
Have you seen John?

44:30.460 --> 44:34.233
No, I haven't, not today.

44:34.257 --> 44:37.202
Which is why I wanted
to talk to you.

44:37.226 --> 44:39.100
Please, sit down.

44:46.511 --> 44:49.248
Last night, I caught John
stealing blood from the O.R.

44:49.272 --> 44:53.667
And when I confronted him,
he ran away from me.

44:53.691 --> 44:56.290
And earlier yesterday, several
blood bags were punctured

44:56.314 --> 44:58.119
and left all over the floor.

45:01.250 --> 45:05.506
The other night, I, um...

45:05.530 --> 45:06.921
I found John unconscious
on the floor.

45:06.945 --> 45:07.922
He had...

45:07.946 --> 45:09.544
cut his wrist

45:09.568 --> 45:14.101
and there was...
There blood on his mouth,

45:14.125 --> 45:15.723
but I didn't think
anything of it, I mean,

45:15.747 --> 45:19.071
it was the first time
that the pain had stopped.

45:19.095 --> 45:22.385
I mean, he wasn't
shaking anymore.

45:22.409 --> 45:25.422
And then last night, he...

45:25.446 --> 45:29.116
He said that he was
a danger to people,

45:29.140 --> 45:31.590
to me, and he ran away.

45:34.490 --> 45:36.492
This doesn't exist, right?

45:39.322 --> 45:42.785
Before John's condition...

45:42.809 --> 45:44.648
I would've said no.

45:44.672 --> 45:46.236
What?

45:46.260 --> 45:48.549
Chloe, we've gotta
call the police.

45:48.573 --> 45:50.551
No.
We can't let him be a danger

45:50.575 --> 45:52.898
to everybody else,
or himself for that matter.

45:52.922 --> 45:53.889
No, no.

45:55.891 --> 45:57.592
Please, Gail,

45:57.616 --> 45:59.249
we both know John,
he's just probably

45:59.273 --> 46:01.286
trying to figure
this out on his own.

46:01.310 --> 46:03.391
I need to find my husband

46:03.415 --> 46:05.152
before the authorities do.

46:05.176 --> 46:07.178
Please.

46:10.768 --> 46:12.252
24 hours.

46:14.841 --> 46:16.025
After that,

46:16.049 --> 46:17.716
I have to call the authorities.

46:17.740 --> 46:19.683
Thank you, Gail.

46:19.707 --> 46:21.099
I'll just...
I'll keep trying him.

46:21.123 --> 46:23.297
Okay, and I'll do the same.

46:24.609 --> 46:26.611
Chloe.

46:28.026 --> 46:30.788
Please take care of yourself.

46:40.521 --> 46:43.328
So where are we going?

46:43.352 --> 46:45.364
You'll see.

46:45.388 --> 46:47.608
So what's your story?

46:47.632 --> 46:50.542
What happened to you?

46:50.566 --> 46:52.568
9/11 happened.

46:56.020 --> 47:00.966
I was in charge of a rescue
dispatch unit when it happened.

47:00.990 --> 47:03.451
Oh, my God.

47:03.475 --> 47:07.007
We were in the north tower
trying to get everyone out

47:07.031 --> 47:09.457
and, um...

47:09.481 --> 47:13.289
then the south tower was hit.

47:13.313 --> 47:15.981
I couldn't...

47:16.005 --> 47:19.571
I had to save myself.

47:19.595 --> 47:22.332
I got out just before the
building collapsed entirely.

47:22.356 --> 47:23.161
How?

47:23.185 --> 47:26.681
I made a choice.

47:26.705 --> 47:29.777
Looking back on it,
I could've saved some of them.

47:32.539 --> 47:35.690
I saw a way out,
I didn't look back,

47:35.714 --> 47:36.760
I didn't tell anyone.

47:36.784 --> 47:39.004
In that moment,

47:39.028 --> 47:42.905
right before
everything goes black...

47:42.929 --> 47:45.355
you have to make a choice.

47:45.379 --> 47:48.289
If you really want to survive,

47:48.313 --> 47:52.224
if you're willing to do
anything to survive,

47:52.248 --> 47:53.801
then you survive.

47:57.115 --> 48:00.854
The pain comes
from unbearable guilt,

48:00.878 --> 48:03.063
like yours, John.

48:03.087 --> 48:06.998
No, try not to think about it.

48:07.022 --> 48:11.692
The pain comes back earlier
than it should if you do.

48:11.716 --> 48:12.935
Anyways,

48:12.959 --> 48:15.385
afterwards,
before it was decided

48:15.409 --> 48:18.664
I was unfit for active duty,

48:18.688 --> 48:20.494
they took away my badge,

48:20.518 --> 48:23.497
put me on permanent paid leave.

48:23.521 --> 48:26.500
So you came to California

48:26.524 --> 48:28.571
and found yourself
a new line of work.

48:28.595 --> 48:30.193
No, I don't look at it that way.

48:30.217 --> 48:32.782
No, life threw me a challenge

48:32.806 --> 48:34.715
and I rose up to meet it.

48:34.739 --> 48:37.925
It wanted to knock me down,
but I didn't let it.

48:37.949 --> 48:40.100
I was supposed to die
that day in that building,

48:40.124 --> 48:42.205
but I didn't.

48:42.229 --> 48:44.828
And I won't let
anyone or anything

48:44.852 --> 48:48.591
take from me what I can have
in this world, John.

48:48.615 --> 48:50.489
Uh-uh.

48:50.513 --> 48:52.388
No.

48:52.412 --> 48:54.838
I don't play
with the cards I'm dealt,

48:54.862 --> 48:59.246
I deal the motherfucking cards.

49:13.122 --> 49:15.204
Hi, you've reached
John Clarke's voicemail,

49:15.228 --> 49:16.653
please leave a message
at the beep,

49:16.677 --> 49:18.310
I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.

49:31.554 --> 49:33.463
Urban legend Carla Franken

49:33.487 --> 49:35.327
was found dead today
in her prison cell

49:35.351 --> 49:37.605
where she was awaiting trial.

49:37.629 --> 49:39.780
Police sources say
she committed suicide

49:39.804 --> 49:41.299
by hanging herself.

49:41.323 --> 49:43.128
Ms. Franken was arrested
earlier this year

49:43.152 --> 49:47.270
for the alleged killing of
24-year-old Sarah Mendelsohn.

49:47.294 --> 49:49.376
Unofficial sources,
at that time,

49:49.400 --> 49:52.172
claim that Ms. Franken
had drank the blood

49:52.196 --> 49:53.794
of her alleged victim.

50:38.518 --> 50:40.116
Hi, you've reached
John Clarke's voicemail,

50:40.140 --> 50:41.566
please leave a message
at the beep,

50:41.590 --> 50:43.419
I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.

51:27.567 --> 51:28.716
Where are we?

51:28.740 --> 51:31.064
That's Jack Crane's house.

51:31.088 --> 51:32.996
The pedophile?

51:33.020 --> 51:35.137
Alleged pedophile.

51:35.161 --> 51:38.140
He was released last month
after a mistrial.

51:38.164 --> 51:39.727
How do you know where he lives?

51:39.751 --> 51:40.856
I got friends.

51:45.861 --> 51:49.427
And that's why they call it
the glove compartment.

51:53.351 --> 51:55.457
Trust you know
how to put those on?

52:03.120 --> 52:04.683
Herb, what are we doing?

52:04.707 --> 52:06.675
Shh, justice, come on.

52:10.748 --> 52:11.852
Come on.

52:13.958 --> 52:15.339
Shh.

52:28.904 --> 52:30.319
Herb...

52:54.792 --> 52:56.804
Look.

52:56.828 --> 52:58.209
Look.

53:03.490 --> 53:04.698
Oh, God.

53:15.433 --> 53:17.377
Well, I guess you're less
imposing to grown-ups.

53:17.401 --> 53:18.861
Who are you?
What do you want?

53:18.885 --> 53:20.621
Who are we?
What do we want?

53:20.645 --> 53:22.623
We want you.

53:22.647 --> 53:25.143
With a fucking gun?
Shut the fuck up

53:25.167 --> 53:26.386
and open your eyes.

53:26.410 --> 53:29.078
What?

53:29.102 --> 53:31.287
That could be your kid, John.

53:31.311 --> 53:33.841
Oh, her.
You fucking pervert.

53:33.865 --> 53:36.189
You disgusting monster!

53:37.490 --> 53:38.491
John?

53:39.906 --> 53:41.332
You dirty fuck!

53:41.356 --> 53:43.196
You piece of shit!

53:43.220 --> 53:45.094
Get the fuck up,
you dirty motherfucker.

53:45.118 --> 53:47.890
No! No! No!
You piece of... shit!

53:47.914 --> 53:49.236
I'll kill you!

53:49.260 --> 53:50.893
I'll kill you, you fucker.

53:50.917 --> 53:52.274
I'll fucking kill you!

53:52.298 --> 53:55.069
You dirty motherfucker!

53:55.093 --> 53:57.865
You fucking dirty
motherfucking...

53:57.889 --> 53:59.281
John. John!

53:59.305 --> 54:02.215
Fuck!
John, stop! Hey! Hey!

54:02.239 --> 54:04.078
That's enough!
That's enough!

54:04.102 --> 54:05.079
Stop.

54:06.829 --> 54:09.222
Shit, man, I thought you
were gonna kill him.

54:09.246 --> 54:11.948
Okay, I wasn't expecting that.

54:11.972 --> 54:13.433
Pretty impressive.

54:13.457 --> 54:15.297
Shit.

54:15.321 --> 54:17.230
What have I done?

54:17.254 --> 54:18.921
Is that why you brought me here?

54:18.945 --> 54:21.268
To beat the shit out of him,
is what you wanted me to do?

54:21.292 --> 54:24.340
Holy shit, what have I done?

54:24.364 --> 54:26.860
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

54:26.884 --> 54:29.345
What about him?

54:29.369 --> 54:32.521
We're not done with him yet.

54:32.545 --> 54:34.581
He's gonna get what he deserves.

54:50.217 --> 54:52.634
Let me take those for you.

55:10.962 --> 55:13.240
That's it.
Okay, just here.

55:16.589 --> 55:18.118
Now what?

55:18.142 --> 55:20.534
I got it from here,
you take a load off, champ.

55:20.558 --> 55:24.020
I'll be right back
with refreshments.

55:59.459 --> 56:01.195
Right on time.
No.

56:01.219 --> 56:02.265
What's wrong?

56:02.289 --> 56:03.957
What did you do to him?

56:03.981 --> 56:05.959
Oh, come on, you're smart enough

56:05.983 --> 56:08.271
for me not to have to explain.

56:08.295 --> 56:10.619
Here.
No, I can't.

56:10.643 --> 56:12.414
I won't.

56:12.438 --> 56:14.243
Don't go down this road, John,

56:14.267 --> 56:16.245
do not make this choice.

56:16.269 --> 56:18.972
I don't to do with whatever
you got going on down there.

56:18.996 --> 56:21.871
Jack Crane is a pedophile!

56:21.895 --> 56:24.391
We did society a favor!

56:24.415 --> 56:27.152
Yeah, how
do you feel, John, huh?

56:27.176 --> 56:28.637
How does that feel?

56:28.661 --> 56:31.122
'Cause that does not
get any better, trust me.

56:31.146 --> 56:35.644
John, do the right
thing, take control and drink.

56:35.668 --> 56:38.060
No.

56:38.084 --> 56:40.234
You need to understand
something, John,

56:40.258 --> 56:42.616
you are either with me
or you're against me.

56:42.640 --> 56:46.482
And, believe me, you do not
want to be against me.

56:47.852 --> 56:49.347
You leave me out of this.

56:49.371 --> 56:51.901
Don't you ever come near me
again, do you hear me?

56:51.925 --> 56:53.410
Do you hear me?

56:57.241 --> 56:58.587
What a waste.

57:02.936 --> 57:05.570
Hi, you've reached
John Clarke's voicemail,

57:05.594 --> 57:07.227
please leave a message
at the beep,

57:07.251 --> 57:09.781
I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.

57:09.805 --> 57:11.714
Hi, you've reached
John Clarke's voicemail,

57:11.738 --> 57:13.336
please leave a message
at the beep,

57:13.360 --> 57:15.580
I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.

57:50.328 --> 57:51.847
Hit me again.

58:00.718 --> 58:02.075
Again.

58:02.099 --> 58:03.928
I'm gonna have to see
some money, dude.

58:14.421 --> 58:16.182
Knock yourself out.

58:30.541 --> 58:32.578
Hey, handsome.

58:36.064 --> 58:39.595
All that and
you're still shaking.

58:39.619 --> 58:42.667
What are you on?

58:42.691 --> 58:44.831
You don't wanna know
what I'm on.

58:49.146 --> 58:50.699
Pour me one?

59:03.816 --> 59:06.208
Hey, why don't we...

59:06.232 --> 59:08.348
come back to my place?

59:08.372 --> 59:11.662
No, thanks, not interested.

59:11.686 --> 59:13.111
Come on.

59:13.135 --> 59:15.586
Hey.
What?

59:18.727 --> 59:21.730
I know what you want.

59:34.122 --> 59:35.686
You don't know what I want.

59:35.710 --> 59:38.343
Fuck.
You don't know what I need.

59:38.367 --> 59:39.897
What's your problem, man?

59:39.921 --> 59:41.657
All right.

59:41.681 --> 59:43.556
Time to go home, buddy.

59:43.580 --> 59:44.753
Let's go.

01:00:03.807 --> 01:00:05.153
Chloe?

01:00:18.649 --> 01:00:19.823
Chlo?

01:02:29.573 --> 01:02:30.747
I'm sorry.

01:02:51.077 --> 01:02:53.321
Come in.

01:02:59.016 --> 01:03:00.811
Gail.

01:03:04.056 --> 01:03:05.619
How is she feeling?

01:03:05.643 --> 01:03:07.438
Better.

01:03:10.131 --> 01:03:12.109
Thank you for...

01:03:12.133 --> 01:03:13.973
saving her.

01:03:13.997 --> 01:03:17.631
How are you dealing
with the pain?

01:03:17.655 --> 01:03:21.290
I'm dealing.

01:03:21.314 --> 01:03:23.730
Tell me about the blood.

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:31.255
Well, it wasn't hard
to put the pieces together.

01:03:35.225 --> 01:03:38.193
Blood is barely a fix.

01:03:39.401 --> 01:03:43.140
So, then, did you attack
that man in the alley?

01:03:43.164 --> 01:03:46.419
It was self-defense.

01:03:46.443 --> 01:03:50.112
But things... things will
never get out of hand again.

01:03:50.136 --> 01:03:52.380
I promise.

01:03:54.796 --> 01:03:56.556
I resign, Gail.

01:03:59.732 --> 01:04:02.217
I'm sick.

01:04:21.927 --> 01:04:23.342
If you get through...

01:04:28.968 --> 01:04:32.523
When you get through this...

01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:37.390
the door is always open.

01:04:40.221 --> 01:04:41.739
We'll see about that.

01:04:45.329 --> 01:04:48.239
But I think Chloe...

01:04:48.263 --> 01:04:51.484
would like to return.

01:04:51.508 --> 01:04:53.751
I think that
she would love that.

01:04:55.408 --> 01:05:01.011
She always was
one of our best nurses.

01:05:01.035 --> 01:05:02.702
Yeah, well,

01:05:02.726 --> 01:05:05.902
too bad she hooked up
with the wrong doctor.

01:06:39.064 --> 01:06:41.145
Alleged pedophile Jack Crane

01:06:41.169 --> 01:06:42.767
has been missing
since last night

01:06:42.791 --> 01:06:43.768
in what appears to be

01:06:43.792 --> 01:06:45.563
an attempt at revenge.

01:06:45.587 --> 01:06:48.118
Crane's release from his
mistrial earlier this year

01:06:48.142 --> 01:06:49.533
attracted nationwide attention,

01:06:49.557 --> 01:06:51.535
causing uproar
from the victims' families

01:06:51.559 --> 01:06:53.433
as well as backlash from the community.
Hey.

01:06:53.457 --> 01:06:55.642
Prosecutors are
fighting for the...

01:06:55.666 --> 01:06:58.611
Hey.

01:06:58.635 --> 01:06:59.646
You feeling better?

01:06:59.670 --> 01:07:02.166
Thanks for the meal.

01:07:02.190 --> 01:07:05.066
You know I'm not much of a cook.

01:07:05.090 --> 01:07:06.470
It was perfect.

01:07:17.999 --> 01:07:21.323
Talk to me, John.

01:07:21.347 --> 01:07:24.488
I need to understand
what's going on.

01:07:30.874 --> 01:07:35.268
Look, I'm... I'm tired of
hiding things from you.

01:07:35.292 --> 01:07:39.272
So I'm gonna tell you
the whole truth.

01:07:39.296 --> 01:07:41.412
Even if it means that...

01:07:41.436 --> 01:07:45.485
you don't want to
be with me anymore.

01:07:45.509 --> 01:07:48.661
Come on.

01:07:48.685 --> 01:07:50.721
That's not gonna happen.

01:07:53.793 --> 01:07:54.977
Tell me.

01:08:00.593 --> 01:08:04.459
Do you remember that man
that was at Brian's funeral?

01:08:30.934 --> 01:08:35.639
John, promise me...
this is over.

01:08:35.662 --> 01:08:38.366
Everything with Herb
and the blood.

01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:40.908
From now on,
we start fresh, okay?

01:08:44.050 --> 01:08:46.063
I can't promise you that
just yet.

01:08:46.087 --> 01:08:47.546
Why not?

01:08:47.571 --> 01:08:49.446
'Cause whatever he's doing
to Jack Crane,

01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:51.517
he's doing to other people.

01:08:51.541 --> 01:08:53.795
So call the police,
we don't want to get involved.

01:08:53.819 --> 01:08:56.477
I already am involved.

01:08:59.825 --> 01:09:02.631
Okay.

01:09:02.654 --> 01:09:03.874
Then what?

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:14.091
Wait here.

01:09:24.194 --> 01:09:26.379
John, old friend.

01:09:26.403 --> 01:09:28.243
We need to have a little chat.

01:09:28.267 --> 01:09:31.581
I thought I made myself clear.

01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:34.560
It's a little chilly
out here, John.

01:09:34.584 --> 01:09:35.560
Oh, by the way,

01:09:35.585 --> 01:09:37.587
your neighbors...

01:09:38.863 --> 01:09:41.082
...such nice folk.

01:09:41.107 --> 01:09:43.776
Come in.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:45.180
Thank you.

01:09:51.946 --> 01:09:53.441
Wow.

01:09:53.465 --> 01:09:57.134
I didn't realize
you were such a big shot.

01:09:57.158 --> 01:09:58.687
I told you I was done.

01:09:58.711 --> 01:10:01.207
No, you're not, John.

01:10:01.231 --> 01:10:03.002
You just had
an instinctive reaction

01:10:03.026 --> 01:10:06.523
to something that your current
set of morals rejected.

01:10:06.547 --> 01:10:09.550
But morals do evolve over time,
believe me.

01:10:11.034 --> 01:10:12.760
But you didn't seem
to hear my warning.

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:17.661
So I brought you this.

01:10:22.666 --> 01:10:25.887
They got your DNA all over them.

01:10:25.911 --> 01:10:27.164
Jack Crane's too.

01:10:27.188 --> 01:10:31.133
If I fall, you fall.

01:10:31.157 --> 01:10:32.780
That means you're stuck with me.

01:10:34.609 --> 01:10:36.069
You set me up.

01:10:36.093 --> 01:10:39.141
I run a very dangerous
business, John.

01:10:39.165 --> 01:10:40.936
I need insurance
that one of my clients

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:44.146
isn't gonna have a moral dilemma
and call the cops on me.

01:10:44.170 --> 01:10:46.010
So let me tell you

01:10:46.034 --> 01:10:48.703
exactly what is
gonna happen now.

01:10:48.727 --> 01:10:52.189
You're gonna shut your mouth
and do what you're told.

01:10:52.213 --> 01:10:54.778
You're gonna come every day
to my showroom.

01:10:54.802 --> 01:10:56.331
I'm gonna give you your fix

01:10:56.355 --> 01:10:57.988
and you're gonna pay me

01:10:58.012 --> 01:11:00.370
out of your big,
fat surgeon salary.

01:11:00.394 --> 01:11:02.258
I don't want your fucking blood!

01:11:03.535 --> 01:11:07.446
Now, you remember, you fuck,

01:11:07.470 --> 01:11:09.689
you are nothing
without the blood!

01:11:09.713 --> 01:11:11.553
Weak, small, pathetic,

01:11:11.577 --> 01:11:13.452
nothing more than
a crippled fucking junkie.

01:11:13.476 --> 01:11:16.662
So you can climb down off
your moral fucking high horse

01:11:16.686 --> 01:11:20.182
and listen very carefully
to what I'm about to tell you.

01:11:20.206 --> 01:11:25.395
You are gonna do exactly
what you are fucking told.

01:11:25.419 --> 01:11:28.467
You're gonna take the blood.

01:11:28.491 --> 01:11:31.504
You're gonna get back to work

01:11:31.528 --> 01:11:33.886
and you're gonna give me
my fucking money!

01:11:40.019 --> 01:11:40.996
He's still alive.

01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:43.344
What do we do?

01:11:43.368 --> 01:11:46.139
I'm gonna end this.

01:11:46.163 --> 01:11:47.865
Grab his keys and his phone.

01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:02.654
What the fuck?

01:13:12.008 --> 01:13:15.321
Please... help me.

01:13:19.084 --> 01:13:20.637
I'm coming, I'm coming.

01:13:28.265 --> 01:13:29.346
All right, stay with me.

01:13:29.370 --> 01:13:32.211
No!
No, no, no, no.

01:13:32.235 --> 01:13:33.902
It's okay, man, it's okay.

01:13:33.926 --> 01:13:35.766
It's okay.

01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:37.354
You're gonna be okay.

01:13:37.378 --> 01:13:38.586
We'll get you out of here.

01:13:40.830 --> 01:13:42.245
Fuck!

01:13:46.801 --> 01:13:48.227
Oh, God.

01:13:48.251 --> 01:13:49.815
Let me out of here!

01:13:49.839 --> 01:13:51.403
You prick!

01:13:53.636 --> 01:13:55.672
Come on!

01:14:01.678 --> 01:14:02.897
Hello?

01:14:02.921 --> 01:14:05.037
Hey, who's there?

01:14:05.061 --> 01:14:07.867
No, no!
Not you, not you, please.

01:14:07.891 --> 01:14:09.800
Not you.

01:14:09.824 --> 01:14:11.664
Let me go, please, please!

01:14:11.688 --> 01:14:13.932
Please, don't hurt me.

01:14:15.796 --> 01:14:16.842
Get out now!

01:14:16.866 --> 01:14:18.764
Get out before I change my mind.

01:14:23.597 --> 01:14:26.610
You listen to me and you
listen to me now, all right?

01:14:26.634 --> 01:14:28.405
You're gonna forget
about everything, okay?

01:14:28.429 --> 01:14:30.511
About me, about this place,
all of it.

01:14:30.535 --> 01:14:33.203
Okay.
But if you ever touch a child again,

01:14:33.227 --> 01:14:35.481
I swear to God, I will find you,

01:14:35.505 --> 01:14:37.069
and next time,
I won't be so nice.

01:14:37.093 --> 01:14:39.658
I promise!

01:14:39.682 --> 01:14:41.694
Now get the hell out of here!

01:14:41.718 --> 01:14:42.937
Get out of my sight!

01:14:42.961 --> 01:14:44.307
Okay!

01:14:49.968 --> 01:14:51.176
No!

01:14:54.248 --> 01:14:56.088
Don't you fucking move.

01:14:56.112 --> 01:14:58.262
So this is how you do it, huh?

01:14:58.286 --> 01:15:00.161
What did you think, John?

01:15:00.185 --> 01:15:02.577
You think I just walk around
openly killing people?

01:15:02.601 --> 01:15:04.821
I'd have to kill someone
every fucking day.

01:15:04.845 --> 01:15:06.236
Not very practical, is it?

01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:07.720
You're no better than him.

01:15:07.744 --> 01:15:10.482
People like this
do what they do for pleasure,

01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:12.725
we do what we do
out of necessity,

01:15:12.749 --> 01:15:14.416
in order to survive!

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:16.211
That doesn't justify
what you've done.

01:15:16.235 --> 01:15:18.559
We're cleaning the scum
off the streets!

01:15:18.583 --> 01:15:20.043
How the hell can you
live with yourself?

01:15:20.067 --> 01:15:21.803
You slut fuck!

01:15:21.827 --> 01:15:23.080
I opened up my arms to you,

01:15:23.104 --> 01:15:25.048
I offered you a normal life!

01:15:25.072 --> 01:15:26.290
This is how you thank me?

01:15:26.314 --> 01:15:27.429
You know what, John?

01:15:27.453 --> 01:15:29.259
I'm done talking to you.

01:15:29.283 --> 01:15:31.951
Get in, you're gonna make
a great addition to my cell.

01:15:31.975 --> 01:15:33.194
You're a fucking monster!

01:15:33.218 --> 01:15:34.920
Shut your mouth,
get in there now,

01:15:34.944 --> 01:15:38.095
or I pay your wife a visit
in more ways than one!

01:15:50.269 --> 01:15:53.076
Gotta admit, I'd rather
drink the blood of a surgeon

01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:54.595
than that of a pedophile.

01:15:54.619 --> 01:15:57.459
My clients might not
know the difference, but I do.

01:15:57.483 --> 01:15:59.738
I might even charge
a little more for it.

01:15:59.762 --> 01:16:01.325
No!

01:16:01.349 --> 01:16:05.019
You're not gonna hurt
anyone else anymore!

01:16:17.089 --> 01:16:18.688
No. No, no, please, no.

01:16:18.712 --> 01:16:21.553
It's been too long since
you've experienced real pain.

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:22.864
No!

01:16:22.888 --> 01:16:24.545
John! John!

01:16:26.651 --> 01:16:28.894
John. John!

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:18.314
You know I'm gonna be like this
for the rest of my life.

01:18:21.179 --> 01:18:22.870
I'm not going anywhere.
