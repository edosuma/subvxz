00:04.137 --> 00:05.238
<i>MILLION DOLLAR LISTING</i>
<i>NEW YORK...</i>

00:05.271 --> 00:06.406
- IF YOU CAN'T GET ME
MY PRICE,

00:06.439 --> 00:07.574
THEN I'LL JUST TAKE IT
OFF THE MARKET.

00:07.607 --> 00:08.742
- OH, MY GOD.

00:08.775 --> 00:10.210
5.350 IS A GO.

00:10.243 --> 00:11.378
- ALL RIGHT!

00:11.411 --> 00:13.480
- THE CURSED PENTHOUSE
IS SOLD.

00:13.513 --> 00:15.815
- WE'LL TRY OUR BEST
TO GET 6 1/2,

00:15.849 --> 00:17.384
AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK,
THEN WE'LL RENT.

00:17.417 --> 00:18.618
- RENT.

00:18.651 --> 00:19.853
I GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO GET THIS THING SOLD,

00:19.886 --> 00:21.221
BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT HER
TO CHANGE HER MIND

00:21.254 --> 00:22.255
AND DECIDE TO RENT.

00:22.288 --> 00:23.390
[groans]

00:23.423 --> 00:25.191
- YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT YOU CAN GET

00:25.225 --> 00:27.494
7.8 MILLION
FOR THAT APARTMENT?

00:27.527 --> 00:29.262
- ABSOLUTELY.
- 'CAUSE THAT'S A BIG NUMBER.

00:29.295 --> 00:30.430
- AND I WON'T DISAPPOINT.

00:30.463 --> 00:31.965
- THIS IS A CHANCE FOR ME
TO PROVE MYSELF

00:31.998 --> 00:33.299
TO A LOT OF
VERY IMPORTANT PEOPLE.

00:33.333 --> 00:34.567
- HELLO.

00:34.601 --> 00:36.636
- NOTHING IS GOING
TO MESS THIS UP FOR ME.

00:36.670 --> 00:39.806
[upbeat music]

00:39.839 --> 00:42.142
- MY MOTTO IS EXPANSION...

00:42.175 --> 00:45.211
ALWAYS IN ALL WAYS.

00:45.245 --> 00:48.381
- NEW YORK CITY, IT'S THE MOST
EXCITING CITY FOR REAL ESTATE,

00:48.415 --> 00:49.549
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

00:49.582 --> 00:51.818
- I'M THE CLOSER
AND A LISTING MACHINE.

00:51.851 --> 00:54.254
WHAT MAKES ME BETTER IS THAT
I WORK HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

00:54.287 --> 00:55.388
[screams]

00:55.422 --> 00:57.057
- I WILL BREAK YOUR TEETH.
- REACH HIGH.

00:57.090 --> 00:58.391
- CAN YOU TAKE
THIS GUY OUT OF HERE?

00:58.425 --> 00:59.759
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO HELP ME.

00:59.793 --> 01:01.294
- WHAT?
- YOU WANT TO CONTROL ME.

01:10.170 --> 01:14.574
[indistinct chatter]

01:14.607 --> 01:15.608
HOW ARE YOU, SIR?

01:15.642 --> 01:17.177
YOU LOOK AMAZING.

01:17.210 --> 01:19.412
MY STORYBOOK OPEN HOUSE
FOR MY CURRENT LISTING

01:19.446 --> 01:22.315
IN 30 LINCOLN PLAZA
IS A HUGE SUCCESS.

01:22.349 --> 01:24.651
WHEN I GOT THIS LISTING,
I PROMISED JANET,

01:24.684 --> 01:26.886
THE CAO OF THE COMPANY,
THAT IN SIX MONTHS

01:26.920 --> 01:29.422
I WAS GOING TO GET HER
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

01:29.456 --> 01:31.291
MORE THAN
THEIR IN-HOUSE BROKERS.

01:31.324 --> 01:32.392
AND IF I CAN DO THAT,

01:32.425 --> 01:34.160
I KNOW IT WOULD LEAD
TO MORE BUSINESS.

01:34.194 --> 01:36.363
SO I PUT ON
A BLACK-TIE EVENT...

01:36.396 --> 01:37.364
- HELLO.

01:37.397 --> 01:38.431
- THAT FEELS LIKE IT CAME OUT

01:38.465 --> 01:39.499
STRAIGHT FROM A FAIRY TALE.

01:39.532 --> 01:40.533
- GO ALL THE WAY DOWN.

01:40.567 --> 01:41.534
- I THINK
IT'S A WONDERFUL EVENT.

01:41.568 --> 01:42.736
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.471
- AND HAVING ALL THESE PEOPLE
IS WONDERFUL.

01:44.504 --> 01:46.239
- THIS IS THE BEST NIGHT
OF MY LIFE.

01:46.272 --> 01:48.808
I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER
WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.744
- HELLO!
HOW ARE YOU?

01:50.777 --> 01:52.212
- I'M GOOD.
HOW ARE YOU?

01:52.245 --> 01:53.680
- GOOD.

01:53.713 --> 01:55.115
- YES, I INVITED RYAN.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.950
I KNOW WE'VE HAD OUR ISSUES
IN THE PAST.

01:56.983 --> 01:58.184
- FEISTY FOR A LITTLE GUY.

01:58.218 --> 02:00.053
- COME ON.
HAVE SOME [bleep] CLASS, BRO.

02:00.053 --> 02:02.288
BUT I HAVE A DUTY
TO THIS LISTING,

02:02.322 --> 02:05.258
AND I NEED TO INVITE AS MANY
POWERFUL BROKERS AS I CAN.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.459
WELL, LET ME SHOW WHY I THINK

02:06.493 --> 02:08.061
IT'S ONE OF
THE MOST AMAZING APARTMENTS.

02:08.094 --> 02:09.162
- WHOOP.
EXCUSE ME.

02:09.195 --> 02:10.497
- WELCOME,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

02:10.530 --> 02:11.598
MY NAME IS SPENCER.

02:11.631 --> 02:12.799
I WILL BE YOUR HOST TONIGHT.

02:12.832 --> 02:14.334

02:18.371 --> 02:19.873
- I'VE BEEN READING
ABOUT YOU.

02:19.906 --> 02:21.875
BUT YOU'RE FAR BETTER-LOOKING
THAN YOUR BROKER SAYS YOU ARE.

02:21.908 --> 02:23.109
- OH.
[laughs]

02:23.143 --> 02:24.110

02:33.253 --> 02:34.754

- HA-HA.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.089
- JUST PLAYING AROUND.

02:36.089 --> 02:37.123
- ALL RIGHT, SO...

02:37.157 --> 02:38.658
- AND HAVE YOU SEEN
THE SWIMMING POOL?

02:44.197 --> 02:45.165
- [screams]

02:45.198 --> 02:47.100
- OH, MY GOD.

02:47.100 --> 02:48.501
- WHY DON'T I SHOW YOU
THE UNITS THAT WE HAVE ALREADY?

02:48.535 --> 02:49.903
- MAYBE THERE'S OTHER BUILDINGS
THAT WE COULD TALK ABOUT.

02:49.936 --> 02:51.438
- WHY DON'T I SHOW YOU
THE UNITS THAT I HAVE ALREADY?

02:51.471 --> 02:53.506
- OH, NO, I'M OKAY HERE.

02:53.540 --> 02:55.008
- WHAT THE [bleep]
IS THIS GUY DOING?

02:55.108 --> 02:57.477
- SO YOU HAVE OTHER APARTMENTS
THAT ARE GOING TO BE COMING UP?

02:57.510 --> 03:01.247
- WELL, AS LUIS KNOWS,
WE HAVE AN INSIDE SALES TEAM.

03:01.281 --> 03:02.315
- SURE.

03:02.349 --> 03:03.917
- BUT LUIS HAS PROMISED TO ME

03:03.950 --> 03:08.321
THAT HE'S GOING TO GET
$7.8 MILLION FOR THIS APARTMENT.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.523
- UH, RIGHT.

03:10.557 --> 03:13.093
UM...

03:13.126 --> 03:15.195
$7.8 MILLION?

03:15.228 --> 03:17.564
THAT'S SUPER HIGH.

03:17.597 --> 03:19.599
I LOVE IT WHEN AGENTS
LIKE LUIS

03:19.632 --> 03:22.102
MAKE IT EASIER
FOR AGENTS LIKE ME.

03:22.135 --> 03:23.636
- DON'T WORRY.
I'LL DELIVER.

03:23.670 --> 03:25.071
- WELL, IT WAS VERY NICE
TO MEET YOU.

03:25.071 --> 03:26.439
I'LL LET YOU GET BACK
TO YOUR PARTY.

03:26.473 --> 03:27.807
BUT THIS IS GOOD.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.843
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO DOING
A LOT IN THE BUILDING,

03:29.876 --> 03:31.511
I MEAN,

03:31.544 --> 03:33.146

03:40.086 --> 03:41.554
AND I'VE HEARD GREAT THINGS
ABOUT YOU,

03:41.588 --> 03:42.989
SO WE'LL CERTAINLY KEEP YOU

03:43.089 --> 03:44.324
AND WE'LL SEE WHAT WE CAN DO,
OKAY?

03:44.357 --> 03:45.525

HAS AN OGRE.

03:55.802 --> 03:57.537
YOU KNOW THAT LITTLE MONSTER
THAT COMES IN THE FAIRY TALES?

03:57.570 --> 03:58.672
THAT'S RYAN.

03:58.705 --> 04:00.140
THIS WAS A BAD IDEA
TO INVITE THIS GUY.

04:00.173 --> 04:01.174
I [bleep] KNEW IT.

04:01.207 --> 04:02.242

04:07.447 --> 04:09.049
WHO I'VE WORKED
SO HARD TO GET.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.884
AND YOU ARE NOT GONNA
[bleep] THIS UP FOR ME.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.719
- IT'S A PARTY.

04:12.752 --> 04:13.753
I'M A BROKER.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.055
I'M SUPPOSED TO TALK
TO PEOPLE.

04:15.055 --> 04:16.656
I'M SUPPOSED TO INITIATE
MY OWN BUSINESS.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.391
THAT'S HOW I MAKE MONEY.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.060
- THIS IS MY PEOPLE.
EVERYBODY'S ENTERTAINED.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.228

WHEN YOU SPEAK SO FAST.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.564
"LA-LA-LA-LA-LA."
I'M GONNA GO.

04:24.597 --> 04:26.733

04:33.840 --> 04:35.208
IS EXACTLY WHAT
YOU'RE DOING TO ME.

04:35.241 --> 04:36.343
- DON'T DO THAT.

04:36.376 --> 04:37.977
WHY WOULD HE TAKE OUT
MY POCKET SQUARE?

04:38.078 --> 04:39.612
I'M GONNA TAKE OUT
HIS POCKET SQUARE.

04:39.646 --> 04:41.281
[grunts]
WHY'D YOU DO THAT?

04:41.314 --> 04:43.883
THAT'S REALLY EXPENSIVE.
- I DON'T GIVE A [bleep].

04:43.917 --> 04:45.085
LISTEN TO ME.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.587

05:06.373 --> 05:07.507

07:07.027 --> 07:08.028
I LOVE REAL ESTATE.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.429
I LOVE ALL BUILDINGS.

07:09.462 --> 07:10.864
BUT THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR,

07:10.897 --> 07:13.667
I CAN'T EVEN CONTAIN MYSELF.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.335
THIS IS WHAT
THE HARD HATS ARE FOR, RIGHT?

07:15.368 --> 07:17.470
WHEN YOU, LIKE, GET SO EXCITED
AS A REAL ESTATE BROKER,

07:17.504 --> 07:19.439
YOU JUST START BANGING
YOUR HEAD ON SOMETHING.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.819
THIS IS SO INSANE.
SO THERE'S NO NEGATIVE.

07:32.852 --> 07:34.287
BE HONEST WITH ME.
IS THERE ANYTHING?

07:34.320 --> 07:37.557
LIKE, EVERY BUILDING
HAS SOMETHING.

07:37.590 --> 07:38.892
PRICE.
- WHAT IT COSTS.

07:38.925 --> 07:40.393
[laughs]
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

07:40.427 --> 07:43.697
- LIKE, $2,600,
$2,700 A SQUARE FOOT AVERAGE.

07:43.730 --> 07:47.067
THE PENTHOUSE, WE'RE THINKING
ROUGHLY $5,500 A SQUARE FOOT.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.769
YOU'RE LOOKING AT JUST SHY
OF $40 MILLION.

07:49.803 --> 07:54.574
- SO BASICALLY, WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT A $180 MILLION SELLOUT?

07:56.076 --> 07:57.310
TIMES 3%.

07:57.344 --> 08:00.780
MM.
5 1/2 MILLION.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.182
I LOVE YOU.
- [laughs]

08:02.215 --> 08:05.051
- I HAVE GOOSE BUMPS
ALL THE WAY DOWN

08:05.085 --> 08:06.586
ON THESE LONG, SWEDISH LEGS
OF MINE.

08:06.619 --> 08:07.821
WHEE-OO-WHEE!

08:07.854 --> 08:09.889
BUT AS MUCH AS I'M EXCITED,

08:09.923 --> 08:11.157
I'M REALLY CONCERNED.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.693
NEW DEVELOPMENT TRIBECA
THESE DAYS IS SELLING

08:13.727 --> 08:15.895
FOR AN AVERAGE
OF $2,000 A FOOT,

08:15.929 --> 08:18.031
AND WE'RE GONNA ASK
FOR A LOT MORE THAN THAT.

08:18.064 --> 08:20.033
GIVE ME A FEW MONTHS,
YOU KNOW?

08:20.066 --> 08:21.935
I NEED TO REALLY START
BUILDING MOMENTUM.

08:22.035 --> 08:25.105
BUT I THINK I CAN DO IT,
BECAUSE THE MARKET IN TRIBECA

08:25.138 --> 08:26.539
IS JUST GETTING STRONGER,
STRONGER, STRONGER.

08:26.573 --> 08:28.541
AND WE'RE GONNA COME OUT
OF THE FLOODGATES AND BAM!

08:28.575 --> 08:29.709
- I'M LISTENING TO YOU,

08:29.743 --> 08:31.144
BUT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE
TODAY IS,

08:31.177 --> 08:32.879
THE OFFERING PLAN
GOT APPROVED YESTERDAY.

08:32.912 --> 08:34.814
SO WE WANT TO GO TO MARKET NOW.
- [laughs]

08:34.848 --> 08:35.915
- WE MADE A DECISION

08:35.949 --> 08:38.118
THAT WE WANT TO GO
DURING CONSTRUCTION

08:38.151 --> 08:39.552
AND GET THIS BUILDING
SOLD BEFORE--

08:39.586 --> 08:41.788
- BUT, ZACH, THESE BUYERS--
THESE ARE GONNA BE

08:41.821 --> 08:44.124
$10 MILLION APARTMENTS
IN AVERAGE.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.059
FAMILIES WALKING INTO THIS DUST,

08:46.092 --> 08:47.527
THEY WANT TO SEE
SOMETHING CONCRETE,

08:47.560 --> 08:50.196
NOT JUST WALKING AROUND
IN CONCRETE.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.331
I MEAN--

08:51.364 --> 08:52.499
- THEY'RE GONNA SEE THE VIEWS,

08:52.532 --> 08:54.067
THEY'RE GONNA SEE
THE CEILING HEIGHTS,

08:54.100 --> 08:55.669
AND THEN WE CAN SHOW THEM
EVERYTHING ELSE

08:55.702 --> 08:56.803
WITH THE RENDERINGS.

08:56.836 --> 08:58.238
- IT'S NOT THAT EASY, ZACH.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.273
IT'S LIKE--I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO SHOW.

09:00.306 --> 09:02.308
AT LEAST
I WANT A BUILDING MODEL.

09:02.342 --> 09:04.144
AND THEN I NEED SOME SORT
OF SALES ENVIRONMENT.

09:04.177 --> 09:05.178
WE GOT TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.646
IF IT'S MY OFFICE,
YOUR OFFICE.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.015
IN NEW DEVELOPMENT,
WHAT YOU USUALLY DO,

09:09.049 --> 09:12.752
YOU GET A SALES GALLERY
ACROSS FROM THE BUILDING

09:12.786 --> 09:15.188
SO BUYERS CAN GO IN,
LOOK AT THE SCALE MODEL.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.857
BUT I DON'T HAVE
A SALES GALLERY HERE.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.259
YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE ME
SOME TOOLS.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.660
- UM...
- DON'T TAKE ME WRONG.

09:20.694 --> 09:21.928
I'M VERY EXCITED,

09:22.028 --> 09:26.266
BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE IT
TOO DIFFICULT FOR ME.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.667
- ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL GET A MODEL MADE.

09:27.701 --> 09:28.768
WE'LL GET, YOU KNOW,

09:28.802 --> 09:30.337
ALL THE COLLATERAL MATERIALS
YOU NEED.

09:30.370 --> 09:32.605
- OKAY.
- GOT ANOTHER RECORD TO SET.

09:32.639 --> 09:33.807
- YES.
I GOTTA GO.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.575
THIS IS AMAZING.
SO AMAZING.

09:35.608 --> 09:36.876
I MEAN, THIS IS HUGE.

09:36.910 --> 09:37.877
THE BEST PART IS THIS--

09:37.911 --> 09:41.448
MY NAME IS WRITTEN ALL OVER IT.

09:41.481 --> 09:43.049
CHING-CHING!

09:47.354 --> 09:50.357
[phone line ringing]

09:52.525 --> 09:54.494
- HEY, JASON, IT'S RYAN SERHANT
FROM NEST SEEKERS.

09:54.527 --> 09:56.062
WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:56.096 --> 09:57.163
- GOOD.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.632
YOU SHOWED THE MILAN YESTERDAY,
REMEMBER?

09:59.666 --> 10:00.633
YOUR CLIENTS?

10:00.667 --> 10:01.968
I HAVEN'T HEARD
FROM BACK YOU.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.940
- IT IS NOT TOO EXPENSIVE.

10:06.973 --> 10:07.974
IT'S A GREAT APARTMENT.

10:08.008 --> 10:08.975
IT'S A PENTHOUSE.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.110
I DON'T UNDER--

10:10.143 --> 10:12.145
DESPITE MULTIPLE SHOWINGS
AND CALLING

10:12.178 --> 10:13.980
LITERALLY
EVERYONE IN THE CITY...

10:14.014 --> 10:15.448
IT'S RYAN SERHANT
FROM NEST SEEKERS.

10:15.482 --> 10:16.516
HOW ARE YOU?

10:16.549 --> 10:17.851
I'M HAVING
A VERY DIFFICULT TIME

10:17.884 --> 10:20.053
SELLING THE MILAN PENTHOUSE.

10:20.086 --> 10:22.522
THE APARTMENT IS A 3 BED,
3 1/2 BATH,

10:22.555 --> 10:24.190
AND IT'S
FLOOR-TO-CEILING GLASS

10:24.224 --> 10:26.326
WITH CITY AND RIVER VIEWS.

10:26.359 --> 10:27.961
BUT I GOT
AN EMOTIONAL SELLER--

10:27.994 --> 10:29.696
- I LOVE THIS APARTMENT, RYAN.

10:29.729 --> 10:31.564
- I AM OVERPRICED,

10:31.598 --> 10:35.935
AND MY ONE AND ONLY INTERESTED
BUYER JUST BACKED OUT.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.275
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
ABOUT THE MILAN?

10:42.308 --> 10:43.576
UGH.

10:43.610 --> 10:46.746
- UM, WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD DO?

10:46.780 --> 10:48.915
- WELL, I MEAN,
EVERY SINGLE PERSON SAYS,

10:48.948 --> 10:50.617
"I LOVE IT.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.718
BUT IT'S OVERPRICED."

10:51.751 --> 10:53.787
WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING
ABOVE AND BEYOND

10:53.820 --> 10:54.988
TO SELL THIS PROPERTY.

10:55.021 --> 10:56.723
WE HAVE SPENT SO MUCH MONEY
ON ADVERTISING

10:56.756 --> 10:58.491
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

10:58.525 --> 11:00.160
AND, I MEAN, IT'S CLEAR

11:00.193 --> 11:02.295
THAT WE ARE JUST TOO EXPENSIVE
FOR WHAT WE ARE.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.064
OKAY, SO THEN WE LOWER
THE PRICE TAG.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.598
SHE'LL NEVER DO IT.
SAM'LL NEVER DO IT.

11:05.632 --> 11:06.633
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

11:07.834 --> 11:08.868
- I'M AT THE TOP,

11:08.902 --> 11:10.437
BUT I'VE BEEN DOING THIS
FOR A LONG TIME.

11:10.470 --> 11:13.106
YOU, IT'S LIKE,
HOW LOW CAN YOU GO?

11:13.139 --> 11:14.341
- JESUS.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.476
HOW CONDESCENDING
THIS GUY CAN BE.

11:24.784 --> 11:26.820
- I'VE BEEN BOUNCING
FROM OFFICE TO OFFICE

11:26.853 --> 11:28.221
LIKE THERE WAS NO TOMORROW.

11:28.254 --> 11:30.490
BUT TODAY, I FINALLY MOVE
INTO MY PERMANENT OFFICE.

11:35.161 --> 11:36.529
- WHAT?

11:36.563 --> 11:38.331
- YEAH, THIS IS ACTUALLY
MY PERMANENT OFFICE.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.799
- OH, HI.
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

11:39.833 --> 11:41.401
YOU LIKE?
- IT'S NICE. IT'S SO CUTE.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.903
I HAD A MEETING AT THE OTHER
DOUGLAS ELLIMAN OFFICE

11:43.937 --> 11:46.106
ACROSS TOWN,
AND THERE IS LITTLE LUIS.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.941
IT'S NICE.
IT'S NICE TO HAVE HIM AROUND.

11:47.974 --> 11:49.876
I LOOK BACK AT WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN ME AND HIM...

11:49.909 --> 11:52.712
- YOU DISGUSTING
[bleep] MOTHER[bleep].

11:52.746 --> 11:54.981
- AND IT'S NOT WHO
I WANT TO BE.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.850
AND I THINK THIS COULD BE
AN OPPORTUNITY,

11:56.883 --> 11:58.251
US WORKING IN THE SAME COMPANY.

11:58.284 --> 11:59.652
LIKE, I SEE A FRIENDSHIP HERE.

11:59.686 --> 12:01.354
I'M SORRY I COULDN'T GET
TO YOUR EVENT,

12:01.388 --> 12:02.355
THE BIG PARTY.

12:02.389 --> 12:03.623
I WAS--
- YES.

12:03.656 --> 12:05.358
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT WAS VERY GOOD, MAN.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.293
WE HAVE MOSTLY PEOPLE
FROM ELLIMAN,

12:07.327 --> 12:09.496
BUT WE HAVE CORCORAN,
WE HAVE BROWN HARRIS,

12:09.529 --> 12:11.631
NEST SEEKERS.

12:11.664 --> 12:14.634
- NEST SEEKERS.

12:14.668 --> 12:16.903
RYAN WENT?

12:16.936 --> 12:20.206
- YEAH, RYAN WAS THERE,
UNFORTUNATELY.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.474
HE CREATED SOME STIR.

12:21.508 --> 12:22.642
- WHAT DID HE DO?

12:22.676 --> 12:24.077
- I FEEL LIKE
WE SHOULD FOCUS ON WORK

12:24.077 --> 12:25.512
AND FORGET ABOUT THIS GUY
COMPLETELY.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.313
- LUIS, I'M YOUR FRIEND.
I MEAN, I WANT TO HEAR.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.616
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME.

12:29.649 --> 12:30.684
- WELL, I DON'T GET IT.

12:30.717 --> 12:32.552
WHY IS THIS YOUR BUSINESS,
YOU KNOW?

12:32.585 --> 12:34.421
I'M NOT--IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M HIS BEST FRIEND.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.489
HE EVENTUALLY APOLOGIZED
LAST YEAR,

12:36.523 --> 12:38.625
BECAUSE OF WHAT HE DID,
WHICH IS GREAT.

12:38.658 --> 12:40.326
BUT THE FACT THAT I DID FORGIVE

12:40.360 --> 12:42.228
DOESN'T MEAN
THAT I NECESSARILY FORGET.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.463
- WHAT DID HE DO?

12:43.496 --> 12:44.597
- OKAY, SO RYAN--

12:44.631 --> 12:46.433
RYAN CAME IN
AND TRIED TO SABOTAGE.

12:46.466 --> 12:49.569
AND HE TOOK HIS POCKET SQUARE,
AND, WELL,

12:49.602 --> 12:53.406
HE TRIED TO SHOVE IT
DOWN MY THROAT.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.710
- WOW.

12:56.743 --> 12:59.179
GO ON.

12:59.212 --> 13:01.314
- WHY ARE YOU SO HAPPY THAT
HE CAME TO SABOTAGE MY PLACE?

13:01.348 --> 13:02.315
- NO, NO, NO.

13:02.349 --> 13:03.316
I'M JUST LIKE--

13:03.350 --> 13:05.318
IT MAKES ME HAPPY,
IN A WAY,

13:05.352 --> 13:06.653
THAT I'M NOT ALONE IN THIS.

13:06.686 --> 13:08.054
I THOUGHT HE PICKED ME,

13:08.054 --> 13:09.122
'CAUSE I'M AT THE TOP,

13:09.155 --> 13:11.157
BUT I'VE BEEN DOING THIS
FOR A LONG TIME.

13:11.191 --> 13:15.929
YOU, IT'S LIKE,
HOW LOW CAN YOU GO?

13:15.962 --> 13:17.931
- JESUS.

13:17.964 --> 13:19.733
HOW CONDESCENDING
THIS GUY CAN BE.

13:19.766 --> 13:22.602
- I DIDN'T TELL YOU THIS,
BUT I SAW HIM, LIKE,

13:22.635 --> 13:24.371
AT AN EVENT,
AND HE HASN'T CHANGED AT ALL.

13:24.404 --> 13:27.140
HE--ACTUALLY,
HE'S GOING THE OTHER DIRECTION.

13:27.173 --> 13:29.442
- I'D RATHER JUST FORGET HIM,
AND JUST CONTINUE TO DO MY WORK

13:29.476 --> 13:31.077
AT MY NEW COMPANY
AND JUST LET IT GO.

13:31.077 --> 13:32.312
- YEAH,
BUT THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.781
IT'S, LIKE--
THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY DOES.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.516
THAT'S WHAT
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO TOO.

13:36.549 --> 13:39.386
IT'S, LIKE, PEOPLE FORGET,
AND THEN HE GETS AWAY WITH THIS.

13:39.419 --> 13:40.920
- I MEAN,
IF FREDDY WANTS TO GO OUT

13:40.954 --> 13:43.089
AND START HIS OWN BATTLE,
GOOD FOR HIM.

13:43.089 --> 13:44.491
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE
ANY PART OF THAT.

13:44.524 --> 13:45.792
YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO--

13:45.825 --> 13:47.794
I DON'T WANT THESE THINGS
TO DISRUPT MY DIRECTION.

13:47.827 --> 13:48.928
- OKAY.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.597
YOU SHOULD GET
SOME FLOWERS HERE ANYWAYS.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.532
- YES, I'M GONNA GET
SOME PAINTING AND SOME STUFF.

13:52.565 --> 13:53.933
LISTEN,
THANK YOU FOR COMING, MAN.

13:53.967 --> 13:56.102
- THANK YOU.

13:56.102 --> 13:57.771
- [laughing]
COME ON.

14:04.911 --> 14:05.945
- HI.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.514
- HI. HI.
- OH, MAN, IT'S SO COLD.

14:07.547 --> 14:08.815
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

14:08.848 --> 14:09.816
HOW ARE YOU?

14:09.849 --> 14:11.351
- OH, YOUR FACE
IS WAY WARMER THAN MINE.

14:11.384 --> 14:12.552
- [laughs]

14:12.585 --> 14:14.154
- DO YOU WANT
TO WALK AND TALK A LITTLE BIT?

14:14.187 --> 14:15.321
- UM, YEAH.

14:15.355 --> 14:18.758
- IF I WANT TO SELL
THE MILAN AT ALL,

14:18.792 --> 14:21.561
I MUST CONVINCE HER
TO LOWER THE PRICE.

14:21.594 --> 14:23.196
SO SINCE
THE BROKER'S OPEN HOUSE

14:23.229 --> 14:25.298
AND ALL OF THE MARKETING
THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING,

14:25.331 --> 14:29.069
WE'VE HAD<i>ONE</i>GUY WHO REALLY
LIKED THE APARTMENT,

14:29.069 --> 14:31.604
BUT HE'S GONE
WITH SOMETHING ELSE

14:31.638 --> 14:34.641
BASED SOLELY OFF OF PRICE.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.676
SO WE MIGHT JUST BE
PRICED TOO HIGH.

14:36.710 --> 14:41.281
- UH, LIKE, I JUST DON'T THINK
HE WAS THE RIGHT BUYER,

14:41.314 --> 14:43.683
NOT NECESSARILY
IT WAS THE WRONG PRICE.

14:43.717 --> 14:46.619
- WE'RE PRICED
AT ABOUT $2,600 A FOOT.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.488
RIGHT DOWN THE STREET,
YOU CAN GET

14:48.521 --> 14:52.392
AN EQUALLY NICE APARTMENT
FOR AROUND, LIKE, $2,000 A FOOT.

14:52.425 --> 14:56.096
SO BECAUSE WE LOST THIS GUY
BASED SOLELY ON PRICE,

14:56.096 --> 14:58.965
LET'S ADJUST
THE PRICE SLIGHTLY.

14:58.998 --> 15:00.900
SO IF WE'RE AROUND
$2,500 A FOOT, AND WE'RE,

15:00.934 --> 15:04.504
LIKE, AT $6,150,000,
THEN THAT'S A NUMBER

15:04.537 --> 15:07.841
THAT WE'VE THOUGHT ABOUT.

15:07.874 --> 15:10.276
- COMPARED TO ALL
THE NEW LISTINGS IN THIS AREA,

15:10.310 --> 15:12.612
I FEEL LIKE OUR APARTMENT
IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

15:12.645 --> 15:13.913
- RIGHT.

15:13.947 --> 15:16.116
YOU ARE THE HIGHEST PRICE
PER SQUARE FOOT

15:16.149 --> 15:20.186
THREE BEDROOM
IN ALL OF MIDTOWN EAST.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.055
IF WE WERE PRICED
AT A POINT

15:22.055 --> 15:23.690
WHERE EVERYBODY SAID,
"OH, MY GOD.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.191
THIS IS THE DEAL TO BE HAD,"

15:25.225 --> 15:27.127
I'D BE SITTING HERE WITH YOU
AND SAYING,

15:27.160 --> 15:28.661
"OKAY, SO WE HAVE TEN OFFERS.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.196
"IT'S GONNA BE
A REALLY HARD DECISION,

15:30.230 --> 15:31.631
BUT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHICH ONE."

15:31.664 --> 15:33.066
- AT 6.15,
I REALLY FEEL

15:33.066 --> 15:36.069
LIKE I'M LEANING TOWARDS
RENTING AGAIN.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.737
6 1/2 IS THE NUMBER.

15:37.771 --> 15:40.940
- I PROMISE YOU,
I DO THIS EVERY SINGLE DAY,

15:40.974 --> 15:45.345
AND 6 1/2, YOU'RE HEARING IT
FROM ME, IS A VERY HIGH NUMBER.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.714
- KEEP IT AT 6 1/2,
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW

15:47.747 --> 15:49.482
I FEEL LIKE YOU THINK
I'M MAKING UP A PRICE,

15:49.516 --> 15:51.351
AND I KIND OF FEEL
LIKE YOU'RE SITTING HERE

15:51.384 --> 15:52.752
MAKING UP A PRICE.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.688
- SURE.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.256
OH, GOD.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.323
WHY?

16:02.696 --> 16:03.663
[knocking on door]

16:03.697 --> 16:05.331
- HELLO?
ANYONE HOME?

16:05.365 --> 16:06.866
- HI, HOW ARE YOU?
- HEY. HI, BEAUTIFUL.

16:06.900 --> 16:08.568
IS ZACH HOME?
- NO, NOT YET.

16:08.601 --> 16:09.803
- OH, OKAY.

16:09.836 --> 16:11.371
I'M HERE TO PUT A MODEL--

16:11.404 --> 16:12.505
- A LIVE MODEL?

16:12.539 --> 16:14.307
- NO, LIKE,
A SCALE MODEL OF A BUILDING.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.242
ZACH WANTS ME
TO SELL THIS BUILDING NOW,

16:16.276 --> 16:17.744
BUT THE CONSTRUCTION SITE
IS DIRTY,

16:17.777 --> 16:19.479
IT'S NOISY, IT'S DUSTY.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.414
SO, THANK GOD,
I'VE CONVINCED ZACH

16:21.448 --> 16:22.949
TO ORDER A SCALE MODEL

16:23.049 --> 16:24.617
SHOWING WHAT THE BUILDING
WILL LOOK LIKE.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.486
NOW THE ISSUE IS,
WHERE AM I GONNA PUT IT?

16:26.519 --> 16:28.955
IT'S $100,000 MODEL.

16:29.055 --> 16:30.190
IT COULD EASILY GET DAMAGED.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.191
HI, GUYS.

16:31.224 --> 16:32.192
I HAVE TO TELL ZACH,

16:32.225 --> 16:33.426
WHO LIVES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

16:33.460 --> 16:35.695
THAT HE NEEDS TO KEEP
THE MODEL IN HIS HOME.

16:35.729 --> 16:37.630
[groans]
IT'S SO HEAVY.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.667
WE DON'T A SHOWROOM,
AND HIS HOME IS SO CLOSE BY.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.069
IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY CONVENIENT
FOR SHOWINGS.

16:43.103 --> 16:46.072
I WANT IT TO BE A SURPRISE
FOR ZACH WHEN HE ARRIVES.

16:46.072 --> 16:47.574
- I THINK HE'LL BE SURPRISED.
[laughing]

16:47.607 --> 16:48.742
- RIGHT?
- YEAH.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.176
- I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET.
I CAN'T WAIT.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.212
I MEAN, LISTEN,
I'M A REAL ESTATE NERD.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.180
THIS IS SO EXCITING TO ME.

17:01.321 --> 17:02.322
WOW.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.523
SO WHAT EXACTLY IS A HUND--

17:03.556 --> 17:07.027
WHY IS IT $100,000?

17:07.027 --> 17:09.295
- BUT WHAT EXACTLY
IS EXPENSIVE?

17:11.664 --> 17:15.201
- IT'S A LOT OF MONEY.

17:15.235 --> 17:17.437
THE MODEL, UM--

17:17.470 --> 17:18.672
WELL, I MEAN,
IT'S A GOOD--

17:18.705 --> 17:20.407
IT'S GREAT.
I--

17:24.377 --> 17:26.479
- BUT, I MEAN,
$100,000?

17:26.513 --> 17:29.749
IT'S, LIKE,
$3,000 A SQUARE INCH.

17:31.284 --> 17:32.252
[gasps]

17:32.285 --> 17:33.253
- OOH.
- OOH.

17:33.286 --> 17:34.354
- THAT'S GOOD.
- OH, YEAH.

17:34.387 --> 17:37.057
THIS ONE IS 12.75
WITH THIS TERRACE HERE.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.224
- THAT LOOKS
PRETTY GREAT TOO.

17:38.258 --> 17:39.459
- I MEAN,
AT LEAST IT'S STARTING

17:39.492 --> 17:41.094
TO FEEL LIKE 12.75.

17:41.127 --> 17:42.562
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
WITH A MODEL

17:42.595 --> 17:44.764
IS THAT IT SHOWS
THE FINISHED ARCHITECTURE

17:44.798 --> 17:46.232
IN TRUE SCALE.

17:46.266 --> 17:50.303
AND BUYERS CAN REALIZE,
"AH! I HAVE THAT CORNER."

17:50.337 --> 17:52.072
THIS IS GREAT.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.239
- HEY THERE.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.075
- HI, ZACH.
- HEY.

17:55.075 --> 17:56.576
- WAIT.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.812
OH, YEAH.
- CHECK OUT OUR NEW DECOR.

17:58.845 --> 18:00.246
- WOW.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.648
- ISN'T IT--
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

18:01.681 --> 18:02.849
IT'S AMAZING.

18:02.882 --> 18:05.652
HELLO?
AREN'T YOU EXCITED?

18:05.685 --> 18:07.787
YOU PAID FOR IT.
- LOOKS GOOD.

18:07.821 --> 18:09.689
- NOW, THE ONLY THING
THAT I NEED TO CLEAR WITH YOU

18:09.723 --> 18:14.728
IS THAT MY IDEA
IS TO HAVE IT HERE.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.863
I CAN'T HAVE IT, OBVIOUSLY,
IN THE CONSTRUCTION SITE.

18:16.896 --> 18:18.565
IT'S TOO NOISY,
AND IT'S GONNA GET DAMAGED,

18:18.598 --> 18:20.200
AND MY OFFICE
IS ACROSS TOWN.

18:20.233 --> 18:22.335
IT WOULDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

18:22.369 --> 18:24.304
- I DON'T WANT PEOPLE
IN THE HOUSE.

18:24.337 --> 18:26.940
- PEOPLE WANT TO BE
IN A WARM, NICE ENVIRONMENT.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.041
LIKE THIS.

18:28.041 --> 18:29.576
SIT DOWN HERE,
LOOK AT FLOOR PLANS.

18:29.609 --> 18:30.844
IT NEEDS TO BE HERE.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.445
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
WHAT HE THINKS.

18:32.479 --> 18:33.880
I DON'T HAVE ANY OPTIONS.

18:33.913 --> 18:36.116
I DON'T HAVE
A SALES GALLERY HERE.

18:36.149 --> 18:38.218
HE'S NOT GIVING ME
ANY OTHER TOOLS.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.253
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.
WE'RE A TEAM.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.721
WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS
THE SAME GOAL,

18:41.755 --> 18:44.958
WHICH IS TO SELL OUT
$200 MILLION QUICKLY, OKAY?

18:47.927 --> 18:50.196
- ALL RIGHT.
ONE EVENT.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.432
GET THE BUILDING SOLD,
AND WE'LL GO FROM THERE.

18:52.465 --> 18:53.633
- I GOT IT.
ONE NIGHT.

18:53.667 --> 18:54.834
ONE BIG EVENT, ONE NIGHT.

18:54.868 --> 18:57.570
SO LET ME GET TO WORK,
AND IF YOU WANT,

18:57.604 --> 18:59.305
YOU CAN PLAY WITH IT
WHILE I'M GONE.

19:00.607 --> 19:03.677
- YOU TOLD ME
YOU CAN GET ME 7.8 MILLION.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.578
YOUR REPUTATION
IS AT STAKE.

19:12.252 --> 19:13.887
- SO, LUIS, HAVE A SEAT.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.488
MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE.
- THANK YOU.

19:15.522 --> 19:16.890
- JANET WILL BE WITH YOU
IN A MOMENT.

19:16.923 --> 19:18.224
- SINCE MY OPEN HOUSE,

19:18.258 --> 19:20.794
I HAVE BEEN GETTING A LOT
OF CALLS ABOUT THIS PLACE.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.062
[cell phone ringing]

19:22.095 --> 19:24.030
HELLO, THIS IS LUIS.
THIS IS LUIS.

19:24.030 --> 19:25.598
HELLO, THIS IS LUIS.
HELLO, THIS IS LUIS.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.033
OKAY.
GIVE ME SOMETHING GOOD.

19:27.033 --> 19:29.536
AND TODAY, I AM BRINGING JANET
AN OFFER.

19:29.569 --> 19:32.906
I KNOW IT'S NOT FULL ASK,
BUT AN OFFER MEANS PROGRESS.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.941
AND THIS IS
A VERY GOOD STARTING POINT,

19:35.041 --> 19:36.710
SO I'M EXCITED TO JUST TELL HER.

19:36.743 --> 19:38.044
- SO WHAT DO YOU HAVE?

19:38.044 --> 19:42.449
- $7.1 MILLION,
CLOSING IN 14 DAYS, ALL CASH.

19:42.482 --> 19:46.386
[dramatic music]

19:46.419 --> 19:48.355
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

19:48.388 --> 19:50.223
I'M NOT INTERESTED.

19:50.256 --> 19:53.893
REMEMBER, YOU SAID YOU CAN GET
MORE THAN MY IN-HOUSE TEAM.

19:53.927 --> 19:58.898
7 MILLION AND 7.1
IS A FAR CRY FROM 7.8.

19:58.932 --> 20:01.868
- JANET HAS A REPUTATION
OF BEING VERY TOUGH,

20:01.901 --> 20:05.038
BUT THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM
FOR NEGOTIATION.

20:05.071 --> 20:06.439
YOU KNOW PEOPLE
LIKE TO NEGOTIATE.

20:06.473 --> 20:07.907
THEY WANT TO COME IN, AND--
- OH, GOOD.

20:07.941 --> 20:10.443
WELL,
I GOT A GREAT COUNTEROFFER.

20:10.477 --> 20:12.479
7.8.

20:12.512 --> 20:13.613
THAT'S IT.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.882
- WHAT I'M AFRAID OF
IS TO TELL THEM

20:15.915 --> 20:17.650
THAT WE'RE NOT EVEN
TAKING THEM SERIOUSLY.

20:17.684 --> 20:19.152
- I'M NOT.

20:19.185 --> 20:21.021
- BUT IT'S A GOOD INITIAL OFFER.

20:21.054 --> 20:26.126
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TOLD ME
THAT YOU CAN GET ME 7.8 MILLION,

20:26.159 --> 20:28.395
AND THAT'S WHY
I GAVE YOU THE LISTING.

20:28.428 --> 20:31.331
- I WANT TO COME IN
AND PRICE THIS UNIT 7.8 MILLION.

20:31.364 --> 20:32.365
- THAT'S A BIG NUMBER.

20:32.399 --> 20:33.400
- I WON'T DISAPPOINT.

20:33.433 --> 20:36.069
- I'M COUNTING ON THAT.

20:36.102 --> 20:37.404
I GAVE YOU A CHANCE.

20:37.437 --> 20:40.573
I DIDN'T HAVE TO GO AND DO THAT,
BUT I DID.

20:40.607 --> 20:42.275
YOU PROMISED SOMETHING.

20:42.308 --> 20:44.778
YOU NEED TO DELIVER.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.216
- I MAY JUST BE IN TROUBLE.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.052
- YOUR REPUTATION IS AT STAKE,

20:52.085 --> 20:54.087
SO YOU NEED TO GET YOURSELF
OUT THERE.

20:54.120 --> 20:56.156
- OKAY.
- OKAY?

20:56.189 --> 20:57.557
- I NEED TO GET THAT NUMBER,
PERIOD.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.092
ALL RIGHT,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JANET.

20:59.125 --> 21:00.193
I DON'T WANT TO LOOK BAD.

21:00.226 --> 21:01.528
IF THERE'S SOMEBODY
IN THIS WORLD

21:01.561 --> 21:02.862
THAT I DON'T WANT
TO LOOK BAD TO,

21:02.896 --> 21:05.732
IT'S JANET AND THE ENTIRE
MILSTEIN ORGANIZATION.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.534
- IT'S NOT PERSONAL.
THIS IS BUSINESS.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.235
- IT IS BUSINESS.
- BIG BUSINESS.

21:09.269 --> 21:11.871
THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE INVOLVED IN NOW.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.180
[champagne cork pops]

21:21.781 --> 21:23.783
- PARTY STARTS IN FIVE MINUTES.

21:23.817 --> 21:24.951
ALL ON.

21:24.984 --> 21:27.087
SINCE LAUNCHING
THE SALES OF 11 NORTH MOORE,

21:27.087 --> 21:29.089
ZACH HAS ALLOWED ME TO DO
ONE-ON-ONE SHOWINGS

21:29.122 --> 21:31.257
WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T
SEEN THE SCALE MODEL.

21:31.291 --> 21:33.493
AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WANT
TO SEE THE ACTUAL BUILDING.

21:33.526 --> 21:35.762
BUT AS I PREDICTED,
AT THESE PRICES,

21:35.795 --> 21:38.798
PEOPLE WANT TO SEE MORE THAN
DUST AND CONSTRUCTION NOISE.

21:38.832 --> 21:40.367
OKAY, HOW MANY PEOPLE
THAT HAVE RSVP'D?

21:40.400 --> 21:42.102
BROKERS?
- 165.

21:42.102 --> 21:43.703
- OKAY.
I THINK WE'RE READY FOR A PARTY.

21:43.737 --> 21:45.105
HI, WELCOME.

21:45.105 --> 21:47.474
ZACH PROMISED ME
A ONE-NIGHT THING

21:47.507 --> 21:48.908
IN HIS APARTMENT,

21:48.942 --> 21:52.479
BUT I DON'T THINK
HE'S EXPECTING 165 PEOPLE.

21:52.512 --> 21:54.314
HI, GUYS.
WELCOME.

21:54.347 --> 21:55.482
HI, WELCOME.
HI, HOW ARE YOU?

21:55.515 --> 21:56.850
- HOW ARE YOU DOING?

21:56.883 --> 21:59.119
- I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE HOME
SO EARLY AFTER WORK.

21:59.119 --> 22:00.487
I'M WORRIED.

22:00.520 --> 22:03.289
I'M NERVOUS BECAUSE
ZACH'S HOUSE IS SO BEAUTIFUL.

22:03.323 --> 22:05.692
AND I KNOW BROKERS.
THEY CAN BE LOOKY-LOOS.

22:05.725 --> 22:06.693
I LIKE YOUR STYLE.

22:06.726 --> 22:08.061
IT'S VERY--

22:08.094 --> 22:10.263
YOU LOOK LIKE ONE OF THOSE BIRDS
THAT ARE ABOUT TO ATTACK.

22:10.296 --> 22:13.066
- OH, THANK YOU.

22:13.066 --> 22:14.200
- OH, MY GOD.
SO MANY PEOPLE.

22:14.234 --> 22:15.869
SO THIS IS WHAT OUR BUILDING
WILL LOOK LIKE

22:15.902 --> 22:17.437
WHEN IT'S FINISHED
IN ABOUT A YEAR.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.372
BUT WE'RE SELLING STARTING NOW.

22:19.406 --> 22:21.341
I'M NOT GONNA RELEASE
THE BIG PENTHOUSE YET.

22:21.374 --> 22:23.610
I WANT IT TO GET CLOSER
TO COMPLETION.

22:23.643 --> 22:25.545
AND THAT COULD TAKE
A WHOLE YEAR.

22:25.578 --> 22:27.280
SO MY STRATEGY IS TO SELL

22:27.313 --> 22:29.349
THE ENTIRE BUILDING
BELOW THE PENTHOUSE.

22:29.382 --> 22:31.217
- [laughs]
- OH, GOD, MORE PEOPLE COMING.

22:31.251 --> 22:32.218
EVERY SINGLE UNIT.

22:32.252 --> 22:33.653
YOU SAID YOU HAVE A BUYER?
- I DO.

22:33.687 --> 22:34.988
- WHAT'S THE SQUARE FOOTAGE
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR?

22:35.088 --> 22:35.989
THIS IS MY DEVELOPER,
BY THE WAY.

22:36.089 --> 22:37.824
[glass shattering]
WHOO!

22:40.260 --> 22:43.530
I CAN TELL THAT ZACH IS GETTING
SLIGHTLY UNCOMFORTABLE

22:43.563 --> 22:46.099
THAT THERE ARE HUNDREDS
OF BROKERS IN HIS HOME.

22:46.099 --> 22:49.135
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

22:49.169 --> 22:50.136
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:50.170 --> 22:51.404
I DON'T FEEL THAT BAD.

22:51.438 --> 22:53.139
HE GAVE ME ONE NIGHT
AND ONE NIGHT ONLY

22:53.173 --> 22:55.342
TO SELL AT RECORD PRICES
IN RECORD TIME.

22:55.375 --> 22:56.343
THIS IS THE NIGHT.

22:56.376 --> 22:57.577
I'M SORRY.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.379
WHEN I HAVE PARTIES,
A LOT OF BROKERS SHOWS UP.

22:59.412 --> 23:00.914
EMAIL THIS
TO ALL YOUR BUYER, QUICKLY.

23:00.947 --> 23:02.515
THIS IS GONNA GO.

23:02.549 --> 23:04.451
- I JUST FOUND PEOPLE
UPSTAIRS IN MY BEDROOM.

23:04.484 --> 23:05.785
- OH. YEAH.

23:05.819 --> 23:08.054
THE TURNOUT IS AMAZING, BUT...

23:08.088 --> 23:09.823
NO, THAT'S HIS BATHROOM.
HELLO?

23:09.856 --> 23:11.291
THE FLIPSIDE OF THAT IS,

23:11.324 --> 23:15.061
SOME BROKERS JUST SHOW UP
TO CHITCHAT WITH FRIENDS,

23:15.061 --> 23:17.464
AND WAH-WAH-WAH,
DRINK A LOT OF ALCOHOL.

23:17.497 --> 23:18.565
- [laughing]

23:18.598 --> 23:20.266
- OH, MY GOD, BROKERS.

23:20.300 --> 23:21.868
EVERYONE, COME TO THE MODEL.

23:21.901 --> 23:24.437
NOW I NEED TO FOCUS EVERYBODY
AND REEL THEM IN AGAIN.

23:24.471 --> 23:25.872
EVERYBODY STOP.
SHH.

23:25.905 --> 23:28.141
IT'S JUST A LOT EASIER FOR ME
TO DO THIS ONCE QUICKLY.

23:28.174 --> 23:29.943
SO BASICALLY,
IT'S 18 UNITS.

23:29.976 --> 23:31.544
WE ALSO HAVE
A 24-HOUR DOORMAN.

23:31.578 --> 23:34.080
WE HAVE PARKING,
BEAUTIFUL BOARDROOM, GREAT GYM,

23:34.114 --> 23:35.782
ALL ON THE GROUND FLOOR.

23:35.815 --> 23:37.250
SO WE HAVE NO RETAIL
IN THIS BUILDING,

23:37.283 --> 23:38.451
WHICH IS VERY IMPRESSIVE.

23:38.485 --> 23:40.620
SO RAISE YOUR GLASS
FOR THE BEST BUILDING

23:40.653 --> 23:41.621
IN ALL TRIBECA.

23:41.654 --> 23:43.089
WHOO!
CHEERS.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.324
all: CHEERS.

23:44.357 --> 23:46.693
- OKAY, EVERYBODY, NOW ZACH
NEEDS HIS BEAUTY SLEEP.

23:46.726 --> 23:48.395
[laughter]

23:54.167 --> 23:55.702
- MY PENTHOUSE LISTING
AT THE MILAN

23:55.735 --> 23:59.239
HAS BEEN A STRUGGLE,
TO SAY THE LEAST.

23:59.272 --> 24:01.441
AND EVEN THOUGH
SAM WON'T COME DOWN IN PRICE,

24:01.474 --> 24:02.809
I FINALLY HAVE SOMEONE...

24:02.842 --> 24:04.744
HEY.
- HEY. WHAT'S HAPPENING, MAN?

24:04.778 --> 24:06.212
- THAT I THINK
MIGHT BE THE BUYER,

24:06.246 --> 24:08.715
AND I CAN TRY TO CLOSE
THIS DEAL.

24:08.748 --> 24:10.250
- I WANT YOU TO KNOW

24:10.283 --> 24:12.352
THAT THIS IS A VERY,
VERY GOOD CLIENT OF MINE.

24:12.385 --> 24:13.887
- SURE.

24:13.920 --> 24:17.057
- SO WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME,
WENT BACK AND FORTH--

24:17.057 --> 24:18.491
- THIS SMELLS
LIKE A LOW OFFER.

24:18.525 --> 24:20.160
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD WAIT
FOR THE OFFER

24:20.193 --> 24:21.928
AND SEE WHERE WE ARE.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.129
- SURE.
DO YOU WANT WATER?

24:23.163 --> 24:24.798
I'LL HAVE WATER.

24:24.831 --> 24:26.866
- WE'LL GIVE YOU
AN ALL-CASH 5.7.

24:26.900 --> 24:27.934
- [sighs]

24:27.967 --> 24:31.304
NOW I NEED SOMETHING ELSE
TO DRINK.

24:31.338 --> 24:34.074
NEW OFFER IS, I MEAN,
GROSSLY INSULTING.

24:34.074 --> 24:35.208
LIKE, IT HURTS A LITTLE BIT.

24:35.241 --> 24:37.377
- THAT'S SORT OF
A COMPLIMENT TO ME, SO...

24:37.410 --> 24:39.612
- LIKE, MY STOMACH HURTS.

24:39.646 --> 24:40.714
- LET'S GET A DEAL DONE,

24:40.747 --> 24:42.082
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF TIME,

24:42.082 --> 24:43.316
YOU DON'T HAVE A TON OF TIME.

24:43.350 --> 24:44.317
LET'S ROCK AND ROLL, HUH?

24:44.351 --> 24:46.486
- SO HERE'S THE THING.
5.7?

24:46.519 --> 24:48.288
THERE'S NO WAY I'M GONNA
BE ABLE TO GET IT DONE.

24:48.321 --> 24:49.622
THEY'D RATHER RENT IT

24:49.656 --> 24:51.825
THAN HAVE ME SELL
FOR SOMETHING THAT LOW, RIGHT?

24:51.858 --> 24:53.293
- YOU'VE BEEN SITTING
AROUND WITH IT.

24:53.326 --> 24:55.095
NOBODY'S LOOKING AT IT.
YOU HAVE NOTHING.

24:55.095 --> 24:56.296
YOU HAVE ME.

24:56.329 --> 24:57.964
AND I'M WILLING TO GO FORWARD
RIGHT AWAY.

24:57.997 --> 25:01.768
- BUT THERE'S NO OTHER
2,500-SQUARE-FOOT PENTHOUSE

25:01.801 --> 25:04.471
WITH OUTDOOR SPACE
IN A BUILDING LIKE THE MILAN.

25:04.504 --> 25:07.240
THE IDENTICAL ONE
DOESN'T EXIST FOR THIS PRICE.

25:07.273 --> 25:10.110
YOU GOT TO GIVE ME SOMETHING
HIGHER TO GO BACK WITH.

25:10.143 --> 25:11.711
5.7 SOUNDS LIKE
YOU JUST PICKED A NUMBER.

25:11.745 --> 25:13.947
- OKAY, GO BACK AT 5.8.
5.8.

25:14.047 --> 25:15.382
GO BACK AT 5.8,
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

25:15.415 --> 25:17.150
- DO YOU HAVE AUTHORIZATION
FROM YOUR CLIENT

25:17.183 --> 25:18.418
TO COME IN $100,000 HIGHER?

25:18.451 --> 25:20.086
- I DO. I'LL CUT THIS DEAL
RIGHT NOW FOR YOU.

25:20.120 --> 25:21.454
SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO.

25:21.488 --> 25:23.423
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

25:23.456 --> 25:26.059
I ALREADY KNOW SAM ISN'T GONNA
TAKE 5.8 AS AN OFFER.

25:26.059 --> 25:28.061
I KNOW THAT AS A FACT.

25:28.061 --> 25:31.965
BUT I HAVE TO POSITION IT
TO HER IN A WAY

25:32.065 --> 25:33.533
WHERE IT ALMOST SOUNDS POSITIVE

25:33.566 --> 25:35.201
SO IT'S NOT
ALL THE DOOM AND GLOOM

25:35.235 --> 25:36.603
THAT SHE'S GOING TO ASSUME.

25:36.636 --> 25:38.872
[phone line ringing]

25:38.905 --> 25:40.140
- HELLO.
- HEY, SAM.

25:40.173 --> 25:41.808
IT'S RYAN.
- HEY, RYAN.

25:41.841 --> 25:43.076
HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD.

25:43.109 --> 25:44.377
I HAVE VERY GOOD NEWS.
- OKAY.

25:44.411 --> 25:46.346
- WE HAVE OUR FIRST OFFER.

25:49.716 --> 25:50.984
- "OH"?

25:51.084 --> 25:52.452
IT SHOULD BE--
YOU SHOULD BE EXCITED.

25:52.485 --> 25:53.486
I HAVE AN OFFER FOR YOU.

25:53.520 --> 25:54.688
AN OFFER, FOR SALE,
FOR, LIKE,

25:54.721 --> 25:56.923
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS
AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

25:56.956 --> 25:58.658
- THEY STARTED LOW.
THEY STARTED AT 5.7.

25:58.692 --> 26:01.828
I GOT THEM TO 5.8, OKAY?

26:01.861 --> 26:02.862
- YEAH.
YES?

26:06.166 --> 26:07.901
- NO, I KNOW.
AND I KNOW YOU WOULDN'T.

26:07.934 --> 26:10.270
AND I WOULD NEVER ADVISE YOU
TO EVEN TAKE 5.8.

26:10.303 --> 26:12.405
- MM-HMM.

26:18.044 --> 26:19.245
- OKAY.
WELL, LISTEN, LISTEN.

26:19.279 --> 26:20.347
I'VE GOT THEM HERE RIGHT NOW.

26:20.380 --> 26:22.148
LET ME SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

26:22.182 --> 26:24.317
AND NOTHING IS REAL
UNTIL YOU SIGN A CONTRACT.

26:24.351 --> 26:26.052
SO DON'T GET STRESSED OUT.

26:29.089 --> 26:30.557
- [groans]

26:30.590 --> 26:33.460
I'VE BEEN IN THIS SITUATION
BEFORE WITH NERVOUS SELLERS.

26:33.493 --> 26:37.464
SO I KNOW THAT IF I CAN
JUST GET SAM THAT MAGIC NUMBER,

26:37.497 --> 26:39.399
I CAN STILL
KEEP HER IN THE GAME.

26:39.432 --> 26:41.134
- SO I TALKED TO HER, RIGHT?
- OKAY.

26:41.167 --> 26:44.104
- AND OBVIOUSLY,
SHE WAS NOT HAPPY.

26:44.137 --> 26:46.840
BUT I GOT YOU A COUNTER, OKAY?
- OKAY.

26:46.873 --> 26:49.843
- AND THE COUNTER IS,
THERE IS NO COUNTER.

26:49.876 --> 26:51.077
6.5.

26:51.077 --> 26:54.080
IT'S A GOOD COUNTER.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.715
- THIS IS GETTING RIDICULOUS.

26:55.749 --> 26:57.083
YOU CAME BACK
WITH A RIDICULOUS--

26:57.083 --> 26:59.219
- YOU STARTED
WITH A RIDICULOUS OFFER.

26:59.252 --> 27:00.687
- TELL ME THE BOTTOM LINE.
YOU KNOW IT.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.022
- I DON'T HAVE A BOTTOM LINE.
- I KNOW YOU TOO LONG.

27:02.055 --> 27:04.157
YOU GOT ONE SHOT.
FINAL AND LAST, BUDDY.

27:04.190 --> 27:06.893
- I DON'T HAVE A BOTTOM LINE.
I DON'T HAVE ONE.

27:09.162 --> 27:12.365
AND I HONESTLY THINK THAT
THAT'S A GOOD, SOLID OFFER.

27:13.767 --> 27:15.635
- THIS SUCKS.

27:15.669 --> 27:16.670
[bleep]!

27:23.576 --> 27:24.678
- GIVE ME YOUR BOTTOM LINE.

27:24.711 --> 27:27.047
YOU GOT ONE SHOT.
FINAL AND LAST, BUDDY.

27:27.047 --> 27:29.149
- I DON'T HAVE A BOTTOM LINE.

27:29.182 --> 27:32.519
- THAT'S IT, MAN.
I'M CALLING MY GUY.

27:32.552 --> 27:35.155
- TYPICALLY, WHEN I SAY
I DON'T HAVE A BOTTOM LINE,

27:35.188 --> 27:38.324
EH, THERE MIGHT BE
SOME WIGGLE ROOM.

27:38.358 --> 27:40.226
- LET ME SEE WHAT HE SAYS.

27:40.260 --> 27:44.130
- BUT THIS TIME, I ACTUALLY MEAN
I HAVE NO ROOM.

27:44.164 --> 27:45.765
GOT NOWHERE TO GO.

27:45.799 --> 27:48.101
SO CRAIG HAS GOT
TO GET HIS CLIENT UP.

27:48.134 --> 27:49.903
- I THINK IT'S DONE.

27:49.936 --> 27:50.904
- 6.5?

27:50.937 --> 27:51.971
- THIS IS THE BOTTOM LINE.

27:52.072 --> 27:54.074
YOU GET YOUR SELLER...
- YEAH.

27:54.074 --> 27:55.642
- TO DO 6 MILLION.

27:55.675 --> 27:56.776
- NO.
NO WAY.

27:56.810 --> 27:57.911
- LOOK--
- THEY WON'T DO IT.

27:57.944 --> 27:59.245
THEY WON'T DO IT.
I LIKE 6 MILLION.

27:59.279 --> 28:00.613
- I CAN'T GO A PENNY
OVER 6 MILLION.

28:00.647 --> 28:02.549
- I GET IT. I GET IT. I GET IT.
- I THINK YOU CAN GET IT.

28:02.582 --> 28:04.150
- PUT YOURSELF IN MY SHOES
FOR ONE SECOND,

28:04.184 --> 28:06.052
LIKE I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN
10,000 TIMES, RIGHT?

28:06.086 --> 28:08.521
THIS IS THE APARTMENT
WHERE THEIR BABIES WERE RAISED.

28:08.555 --> 28:09.656
THEY LOOK EVERYWHERE,

28:09.689 --> 28:11.558
AND THEY SEE LITTLE BABY
FOOTSTEPS RUNNING OVER.

28:11.591 --> 28:14.627
THOSE BABY FOOTSTEPS
HAVE A PRICE OF $6.5 MILLION.

28:14.661 --> 28:16.930
- YOU MEAN YOU'RE QUANTIFYING
BABY FOOTSTEPS NOW?

28:17.030 --> 28:18.465
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME
I'VE HEARD THAT.

28:18.498 --> 28:20.100
HOW MANY FOOTSTEPS
ARE THERE?

28:20.133 --> 28:21.701
- 500,000 OF THEM.

28:21.735 --> 28:22.802
- LISTEN,
I GOT TO GET GOING.

28:22.836 --> 28:25.271
- OKAY,
LET ME SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

28:25.305 --> 28:27.407
6.5 IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

28:27.440 --> 28:29.042
I'VE KNOWN THIS
FROM THE BEGINNING.

28:29.042 --> 28:32.645
$6 MILLION IS A GOOD OFFER.

28:32.679 --> 28:34.647
SAM SHOULD TAKE THIS.

28:34.681 --> 28:36.616
- HELLO.
- HEY, SAM.

28:36.649 --> 28:39.085
IT'S RYAN.

28:39.119 --> 28:42.622
- HI.
SO GOOD NEWS AGAIN.

28:42.655 --> 28:46.326
I JUST WENT DOWN THERE
AND BASICALLY HAD A FISTFIGHT,

28:46.359 --> 28:49.696
BUT THEY CAME UP TO 6 MILLION,
BEST AND FINAL.

28:49.729 --> 28:53.500
AND I HONESTLY THINK THAT
THAT'S A GOOD, SOLID OFFER.

28:53.533 --> 28:58.071
- UM, I--

29:11.384 --> 29:14.354
- EVEN IF THEY CAME TO 6.4,
YOU DON'T WANT TO--

29:14.387 --> 29:15.388
YOU DON'T WANT TO SELL IT?

29:21.861 --> 29:23.430
- NO PROBLEM, SAM.
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

29:23.463 --> 29:25.298
- BYE.

29:28.802 --> 29:30.870
- [bleep]!

29:30.904 --> 29:33.707
THIS SUCKS.

29:33.740 --> 29:35.175
[bleep] DAMN IT.

29:35.208 --> 29:37.544
NOW I HAVE TO GO IN THERE
AND TELL A GOOD BROKER

29:37.577 --> 29:40.613
WHO HAS A GOOD BUYER

29:40.647 --> 29:42.682
THAT I DON'T EVEN HAVE
AN APARTMENT TO SELL HIM.

29:42.716 --> 29:44.651
- LET'S GET IT DONE.
- [groans]

29:44.684 --> 29:46.152
- WE'RE DONE?

29:46.186 --> 29:48.688
- NO.
NOT YET.

29:48.722 --> 29:49.756
WE--

29:49.789 --> 29:51.391
- LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT HIT
BY A BUS.

29:51.424 --> 29:54.160
- I DID A LITTLE BIT.

29:54.194 --> 29:56.196
THERE'S--THERE'S--
THEY'RE NOT GONNA DO THE DEAL,

29:56.229 --> 29:57.731
AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE IT
OFF THE MARKET.

29:57.764 --> 30:00.266
THERE'S NO DEAL.

30:00.300 --> 30:02.068
- I GOT HIM TO 6 MILLION,

30:02.102 --> 30:04.204
AND YOU'RE COMING DOWN HERE
SAYING THERE'S A PROBLEM?

30:04.237 --> 30:05.372
- THERE IS A PROBLEM.

30:05.405 --> 30:06.406
- WHAT IS THE--
WHAT COULD THE PROBLEM BE?

30:06.439 --> 30:07.674
- EVEN IF YOU CAME BACK
TO ME AND SAID,

30:07.707 --> 30:08.942
"RYAN, NO, HE'S GONNA TAKE IT
FOR FULL ASK,"

30:08.975 --> 30:10.276
THEY'RE NOT GONNA DO IT.

30:10.310 --> 30:11.978
- SO I GUESS IT'S A WASTE
OF MY TIME THEN, HUH?

30:12.012 --> 30:13.480
- WE WIN SOME,
WE LOSE SOME.

30:13.513 --> 30:15.215
- I'M OUT OF HERE.

30:15.248 --> 30:16.349
REALLY UPSETTING.
- YEAH.

30:16.383 --> 30:20.086
- IT'S REALLY UPSETTING ME.

30:20.120 --> 30:21.788
- I LOVE THIS BUSINESS.

30:21.821 --> 30:23.089
IT'S THE GREATEST BUSINESS.

30:28.595 --> 30:31.431
- ONE, TWO.
HOOK, CROSS.

30:31.464 --> 30:32.932
CROSS.

30:32.966 --> 30:34.234
- AH, [bleep].
ALL RIGHT, SORRY.

30:34.267 --> 30:35.602
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

30:35.635 --> 30:36.970
FOCUS.
HANDS UP, HANDS UP.

30:37.003 --> 30:38.805
- MY MEETING WITH JANET
WAS VERY TOUGH.

30:38.838 --> 30:41.574
AND FOR THE PAST THREE WEEKS,
I REACHED OUT TO MY BUYERS,

30:41.608 --> 30:42.709
AND I TOLD THEM THAT JANET

30:42.742 --> 30:44.377
WILL NOT TAKE ANYTHING
UNDER FULL ASKING.

30:44.411 --> 30:46.579
AND UNFORTUNATELY,
THEY WERE NOT INTERESTED.

30:46.613 --> 30:48.381
[groans]
[bleep].

30:48.415 --> 30:49.849
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

30:49.883 --> 30:51.918
- I FEEL LIKE--I FEEL LIKE
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT,

30:51.951 --> 30:53.386
AND I GOT KNOCKED DOWN,
AND I LOST MY--

30:53.420 --> 30:55.155
- OKAY, GET UP.
- OKAY.

30:55.188 --> 30:57.090
- THE BELL DIDN'T RING.
THE FIGHT'S NOT OVER.

30:57.123 --> 30:58.792
- FIGHT'S NOT OVER.
- OKAY?

30:58.825 --> 31:01.161
CROSS OVER.

31:01.194 --> 31:02.762
GOOD.

31:02.796 --> 31:04.130
YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A FIGHT,

31:04.164 --> 31:05.598
AND YOU GOTTA
FINISH THE FIGHT.

31:12.472 --> 31:13.440
- WELCOME.

31:13.473 --> 31:14.741
- THANK YOU.

31:14.774 --> 31:15.742
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

31:15.775 --> 31:17.777
- BEAUTIFUL.
- I LIKE.

31:17.811 --> 31:18.778
- IT'S IMPRESSIVE.

31:18.812 --> 31:19.779
IT'S BIG.

31:19.813 --> 31:21.114
- IT IS VERY BIG.
- IT IS.

31:21.147 --> 31:23.116
- I ONLY HAVE THREE MONTHS LEFT
ON MY EXCLUSIVE.

31:23.149 --> 31:24.351
- LOVE IT.
- THAT IS GREAT.

31:24.384 --> 31:25.518
- I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.

31:25.552 --> 31:27.187
- THIS IS NEW YORK.
NEW YORK.

31:27.220 --> 31:28.521
- THIS IS
FRANK SINATRA NEW YORK.

31:28.555 --> 31:29.889
- THIS<i>IS</i>FRANK SINATRA
NEW YORK.

31:29.923 --> 31:31.791
- RIGHT NOW,
I'M FEELING VERY PRESSURED.

31:31.825 --> 31:34.461
I HAVE TO SELL THIS PLACE,
OR JANET WILL NOT CONSIDER ME

31:34.494 --> 31:36.262
FOR ANY FUTURE BUSINESS.

31:36.296 --> 31:38.164
- SO WHAT IS THIS LISTED AT?
- 7.8.

31:38.198 --> 31:40.467
- SO WHAT, WE'RE LOOKING
AT 2,900 BUCKS A FOOT?

31:40.500 --> 31:41.701
- 28 AND 1/2.

31:41.735 --> 31:43.803
- OKAY, I THINK
IT'S A LITTLE HIGH.

31:43.837 --> 31:45.638

DAY IN AND DAY OUT.

39:28.668 --> 39:30.103
I'M NOT JOKING.

39:30.136 --> 39:32.038
I'VE BEEN GETTING AT LEAST
SIX OR SEVEN SHOWINGS A WEEK.

39:32.038 --> 39:33.306
SO TODAY,
I'M MEETING WITH JANET

39:33.340 --> 39:34.774
BECAUSE SHE WANTS
A PROGRESS REPORT.

39:34.808 --> 39:35.809
I HAVE NO OFFERS YET,

39:35.842 --> 39:37.110
BUT A LOT OF THINGS
ARE HAPPENING

39:37.143 --> 39:38.111
THAT ARE VERY POSITIVE.

39:38.144 --> 39:39.412
- SO HOW'S IT BEEN?

39:39.446 --> 39:40.680
- WELL, IT'S BEEN AMAZING.

39:40.714 --> 39:42.482
I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN SHOWING
THREE TIMES A DAY.

39:42.515 --> 39:43.683
- THAT'S BUSY.

39:43.717 --> 39:46.853
- THAT IS VERY BUSY.
- BUT THE BOTTOM LINE?

39:46.886 --> 39:48.922
- BOTTOM LINE IS--
BOTTOM LINE IS--

39:48.955 --> 39:50.890
LET ME JUST--YOU KNOW--
I KNOW--

39:50.924 --> 39:52.058
OKAY, BOTTOM LINE.

39:52.058 --> 39:53.259
I GOT TO GIVE IT TO YOU
STRAIGHT.

39:53.293 --> 39:56.796
I HAVE NOTHING RIGHT NOW.

39:56.830 --> 39:58.164
HOWEVER, WE HAVE GREAT RESULTS

39:58.198 --> 40:01.101
AS FAR AS BRINGING PEOPLE
INTO THE APARTMENT,

40:01.134 --> 40:03.036
AND IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
TILL PEOPLE START--

40:03.069 --> 40:04.471
- LUIS,
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

40:04.504 --> 40:06.272
A RESULT IS NOT,

40:06.306 --> 40:08.742
"I HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE
GO THROUGH THAT APARTMENT."

40:08.775 --> 40:09.909
THAT'S NOT A RESULT.

40:09.943 --> 40:11.911
A RESULT IS MONEY.

40:11.945 --> 40:13.780
A RESULT IS A CLOSING.

40:13.813 --> 40:15.015
THAT IS A RESULT.

40:15.048 --> 40:17.650
- BUT SOMETIMES--SOMETIMES
GOOD RESULTS TAKE TIME,

40:17.684 --> 40:19.419
UNTIL THAT RIGHT NUMBER
COMES ALONG, AND I--

40:19.452 --> 40:23.690
- LUIS,
THE TIMING IS UP.

40:23.723 --> 40:24.991
THAT'S IT.

40:25.025 --> 40:27.327
IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON.

40:27.360 --> 40:28.762
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

40:28.795 --> 40:30.764
THE TIME IS NOT UP YET.

40:30.797 --> 40:32.999
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE'S TRYING
TO PULL THE PLUG EARLY.

40:33.033 --> 40:37.003
- I'M WILLING TO GIVE YOU
SIX MONTHS WITH AN OUT.

40:37.037 --> 40:39.873
SO WE COULD END UP DOING THIS

40:39.906 --> 40:41.374
IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO DELIVER

40:41.408 --> 40:43.276
ON WHAT IT IS
THAT YOU'RE PROMISING.

40:43.309 --> 40:44.511
- AND I WILL.

40:44.544 --> 40:46.312
I STILL HAVE TWO MORE MONTHS
FOR THIS LISTING,

40:46.346 --> 40:48.014
AND, YOU KNOW,
I'M GETTING A LOT OF TRAFFIC.

40:48.048 --> 40:49.315
I KNOW YOU'RE ALL BUSINESS,

40:49.349 --> 40:51.251
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT
AND RESPECT THAT VERY MUCH.

40:51.284 --> 40:53.653
BUT I HAVE PUT SO MUCH WORK
INTO THIS.

40:53.687 --> 40:55.855
NOW I'M GETTING THE MOMENTUM,
AND THE MOMENTUM IS THERE.

40:55.889 --> 40:57.123
- OBVIOUSLY NOT.

40:57.157 --> 40:59.759
YOU GIVE ME ONE OFFER
IN FOUR MONTHS.

40:59.793 --> 41:01.728
YOU KNOW, YOU HAD
A GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME

41:01.761 --> 41:03.329
TO TRY TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN.

41:03.363 --> 41:04.798
AND IT DIDN'T.

41:04.831 --> 41:06.399
IN THE TIME
THAT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING

41:06.433 --> 41:08.835
IN THIS BUILDING,
WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF SALES.

41:08.868 --> 41:10.136
WE HAVE.

41:10.170 --> 41:11.404
YOU HAVEN'T.

41:11.438 --> 41:13.406
- I WAS TRYING TO GO
FOR A MORE AMBITIOUS PRICE.

41:13.440 --> 41:17.077
- LUIS, ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT YOU NEED TO REALIZE--

41:17.077 --> 41:19.946
THE NUMBER ONE RULE
IN REAL ESTATE IN NEW YORK,

41:19.979 --> 41:23.883
WHEN YOU SAY SOMETHING,
YOU HAVE TO DELIVER.

41:23.917 --> 41:25.318
YOU DIDN'T DELIVER,

41:25.352 --> 41:27.220
AND NOW I'M GOING TO HAVE
MY PEOPLE

41:27.253 --> 41:31.191
WORK ON SELLING THAT APARTMENT.

41:31.224 --> 41:32.559
THAT'S IT.

41:32.592 --> 41:34.327
- THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING
THAT CAN BE DONE.

41:34.361 --> 41:36.396
- NO.
NO, THERE ISN'T, DEAR.

41:38.998 --> 41:40.567
- ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED
IN ME?

41:40.600 --> 41:43.203
- I KNOW YOU TRIED,

41:43.236 --> 41:45.939
AND IT DIDN'T WORK OUT.

41:45.972 --> 41:47.741
I AM DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.

41:50.810 --> 41:52.379
- I MADE A MISTAKE.

41:52.412 --> 41:54.114
I OVERPROMISED TO JANET,

41:54.147 --> 41:56.649
AND I OVERPRICED THIS UNIT.

41:56.683 --> 41:58.485
- GOOD LUCK.

41:58.518 --> 41:59.819
- THANK YOU.

41:59.853 --> 42:01.321
AND TO HEAR JANET,

42:01.354 --> 42:05.225
ONE OF THE PEOPLE
THAT I ADMIRE THE MOST,

42:05.258 --> 42:09.396
SAY THAT SHE IS DISAPPOINTED,
IT'S DESTROYING ME.

42:09.429 --> 42:10.397
- THANK YOU.

42:10.430 --> 42:11.631
- ALL RIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT, JANET.

42:11.664 --> 42:13.066
- OKAY.
BUH-BYE.

42:13.066 --> 42:15.935
- [sighs]

42:15.969 --> 42:18.271
IT'S ABOUT
THE BIGGER PICTURE,

42:18.304 --> 42:20.540
THE RELATIONSHIP
WITH SOMEONE SO POWERFUL,

42:20.573 --> 42:24.377
SOMEONE THAT YOU WANT
TO PROVE YOURSELF TO.

42:24.411 --> 42:26.646
IT BREAKS ME.
