WEBVTT

00:28.729 --> 00:29.930
Cranberry cobbler.

00:29.997 --> 00:32.233
Your mom.

00:32.300 --> 00:34.935
Every Thanksgiving I see
you in here with her.

00:35.002 --> 00:37.271
She'd order
the cranberry cobbler.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.073
It was a tradition.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.808
You've grown.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.444
Yeah. It's been a while.

00:50.418 --> 00:52.120
There's no rush with that.

00:54.988 --> 00:56.824
Come in now and again
by herself.

00:56.890 --> 01:00.161
Cup of coffee,
take a break.

01:00.228 --> 01:02.062
Sat right there
where you're sitting.

01:03.197 --> 01:04.432
Nice lady.

01:04.498 --> 01:05.566
Yeah.

01:10.971 --> 01:12.106
And you.

01:12.973 --> 01:14.308
You doing all right?

01:17.845 --> 01:19.213
I'm glad to see you.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.550
Start a new tradition,
maybe.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.527
I think
I want some cobbler.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.297
Now you're talking.

01:38.132 --> 01:39.800
Cobbler's on the house.

01:46.174 --> 01:47.441
Harry?

01:49.510 --> 01:50.811
Bosch?

01:50.878 --> 01:53.314
Hey. Where'd you go?

01:53.381 --> 01:56.417
I was thinking
about my mom.

01:58.319 --> 01:59.687
That's sweet.

01:59.753 --> 02:02.323
Mm. Pintia Rioja.

02:02.390 --> 02:04.024
Grace Billets
knows her reds.

02:04.091 --> 02:05.793
You better believe it.

02:05.859 --> 02:08.095
Your family celebrate
Thanksgiving?

02:08.162 --> 02:10.298
Absolutely.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.600
We so wanted to fit in.

02:12.666 --> 02:16.003
Mom would make
all the American classics:

02:16.069 --> 02:17.638
turkey, cranberry,

02:17.705 --> 02:20.208
patatas dulces, carimañola,
patacones, arroz con coco.

02:20.274 --> 02:21.475
Right. Okay.

02:21.542 --> 02:23.844
We coulda brought
arroz con coco.

02:23.911 --> 02:26.280
Lis!

02:26.347 --> 02:29.450
So have you made a decision
about Maddie's travel ball?

02:29.517 --> 02:31.585
Well, I'm not crazy
about the idea

02:31.652 --> 02:33.187
of her being away
every weekend,

02:33.254 --> 02:34.755
people and places
I don't know.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.290
You going to pack her
in bubble wrap

02:36.357 --> 02:38.426
- when she goes off to college?
- Maybe.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.527
148.

02:39.593 --> 02:40.794
- Oh. Good.
- Ooh.

02:40.861 --> 02:43.831
So, uh, what is
the target there, sport?

02:43.897 --> 02:45.199
Oh, Mank,

02:45.266 --> 02:47.301
turkey is the most difficult
of all meats to cook,

02:47.368 --> 02:49.203
your reason being your thigh,

02:49.270 --> 02:51.272
with its higher fiber
and fat,

02:51.339 --> 02:54.508
isn't done until it
reaches 165 degrees.

02:54.575 --> 02:57.010
But your breast gets
all dry and ropey

02:57.077 --> 02:58.512
at anything over 150.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.381
Sounds like menopause to me.

03:00.448 --> 03:02.983
- Huh.
- Lisa, get in here!

03:03.050 --> 03:04.652
Oh, please tell me more.

03:04.718 --> 03:07.154
Well, you could
spatchcock it,

03:07.221 --> 03:08.656
but then
the lieutenant is left

03:08.722 --> 03:11.225
without
the pleasing visual
of the complete bird

03:11.292 --> 03:12.860
before its carving
on the table.

03:12.926 --> 03:13.894
Right,
right, right.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.028
Did he just
say spatchcock?

03:15.095 --> 03:16.297
- Yeah.
- Okay.

03:16.364 --> 03:17.831
You've gone viral
again, Harry.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.433
Hey, Lisa, mash.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.634
Maddie,
get the butter.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.236
What are you talking
about, Lis?

03:22.303 --> 03:23.771
So now you're a suspect
in a murder.

03:23.837 --> 03:24.938
What?

03:25.005 --> 03:27.241
Hashtag down
and dirty detective.

03:27.308 --> 03:28.576
Thanks for sharing.

03:28.642 --> 03:31.312
Did it just get
colder in here?

03:31.379 --> 03:32.646
"Speculation rampant.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.382
"The unnamed detective
is Harry Bosch,

03:34.448 --> 03:36.650
"a key witness in the
Andrew Holland murder trial"?

03:36.717 --> 03:38.286
Ugh. This comes
from Holland's people.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.153
Is there a factual
basis for this?

03:40.220 --> 03:42.022
Well, only technically.

03:42.089 --> 03:44.725
Shit. "Thanks
for sharing" is right.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.093
Jesus, Harry.

03:46.159 --> 03:50.398
You know, we were just saying
good food, good friends,

03:50.464 --> 03:51.799
- good feelings.
- Yeah.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.734
Crap! It's 170!

03:53.801 --> 03:55.135
Oh, for God's sake.
Watch out.

03:55.202 --> 03:56.337
Out of the way,
out of the way.

03:56.404 --> 03:58.138
- Ohh!
- Barrel, for God's sake,

03:58.205 --> 03:59.973
I give you one job-- one!

04:00.040 --> 04:01.108
That's it.

04:01.174 --> 04:02.376
Right here.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.715
Hey, hey. Car.

04:07.781 --> 04:08.882
Watch out, man.

04:13.153 --> 04:14.655
Look, where's Joe and Jack?

04:14.722 --> 04:16.256
We got to get
this game going.

04:16.324 --> 04:17.525
I'll be back.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.672
Have you seen our sons?

04:31.739 --> 04:32.640
Touch football?

04:32.706 --> 04:35.309
Turkey Bowl.
It's tradition.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.378
Yeah. Your tradition
of never being able

04:37.445 --> 04:39.046
to convince enough
people to play.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.449
That's not fair.
Just two years ago,
we went into overtime.

04:41.515 --> 04:42.850
Yeah. I remember.

04:42.916 --> 04:45.118
Your mama's sweet
potatoes caught fire.

04:45.185 --> 04:46.920
Yes.

04:48.188 --> 04:49.423
You look tired, J.

04:49.490 --> 04:50.958
The Bosch
still wearing you down?

04:53.461 --> 04:54.762
You look great.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.067
They're back there.

05:05.439 --> 05:08.542
Yo. Jack. Joe.
We got a game outside.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.644
I got a game here.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.023
- Look out, Mason.
- Hey, come on, Mick.

05:30.364 --> 05:31.632
Oh, no.

05:31.699 --> 05:33.000
...while Orange County
deputies

05:33.066 --> 05:34.702
are trying to identify
the body of a man

05:34.768 --> 05:36.937
who's washed ashore
early this morning...

05:42.142 --> 05:43.877
Now Rampart?

05:43.944 --> 05:45.546
Rampart, then home.

05:45.613 --> 05:47.481
I think the rank and file
really appreciated

05:47.548 --> 05:49.583
your holiday PM
watch visit, sir.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.619
Well, I appreciate
their indulgence.

05:52.786 --> 05:53.921
And yours.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.564
Did I keep you from
your family today, Sergeant?

06:03.631 --> 06:05.833
No, sir. We're eating later.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.167
You?

06:07.234 --> 06:08.402
Volunteered
to help serve meals

06:08.469 --> 06:09.637
at the L.A. Mission.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.004
That it?

06:11.071 --> 06:13.541
Well, the chef at Providence
has promised me

06:13.607 --> 06:16.209
some canneberge émietter
right there.

06:16.276 --> 06:18.145
And a 70-year-old almagnac.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.387
Trouble?

06:29.790 --> 06:30.924
Bosch.

06:34.628 --> 06:37.097
**

06:56.049 --> 06:58.786
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

06:58.852 --> 07:01.021
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

07:01.088 --> 07:04.057
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

07:04.124 --> 07:06.259
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

* I got a feeling

8...

07:45.465 --> 07:46.634
9...

07:47.735 --> 07:48.702
10.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.940
Bosch.

09:24.364 --> 09:25.799
I'm going to be in late.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.735
Jerry, guess who just called.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.770
Harry, I've been up
since the crack of dawn

09:29.837 --> 09:31.204
waiting to buy my kids

09:31.271 --> 09:33.841
some skater stuff
they've been on about.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.575
I'm not in the mood
to guessing anything.

09:35.643 --> 09:37.077
You should shop online.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.646
Like you would
know about that.

09:38.712 --> 09:40.080
It's the 21st century,
Jerry.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.882
Black Friday lines
are for cavemen.

09:41.949 --> 09:44.785
Fuck you.
Who called?

09:44.852 --> 09:46.119
Our favorite fed.

09:46.186 --> 09:49.356
Said a body washed up
yesterday off Seal Beach.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.523
Army embark clerk.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.860
May be connected
to Dobbs and his crew.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.194
Maybe.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.929
You're gonna drive
to south bum-fuck

09:55.996 --> 09:56.730
on a maybe?

09:56.797 --> 09:57.798
Where are you?

09:57.865 --> 09:59.166
I'll come pick you up.

10:01.869 --> 10:03.737
And you'll be bringing me
a skinny macchiato

10:03.804 --> 10:05.172
with three shots.

10:06.473 --> 10:07.941
A man can dream.

10:21.354 --> 10:22.589
You got an address?

10:22.656 --> 10:25.192
- Of course.
- Yeah. What is that?

10:25.258 --> 10:26.326
Holland read a book.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.795
Pulled it from a shelf.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.296
I've been thinking.

10:29.362 --> 10:31.164
Whoever sprung Gunn from jail
probably works for--

10:31.231 --> 10:32.800
Found our bail girl
in there, didn't you?

10:32.866 --> 10:34.534
Waiting for you to ask.

10:34.601 --> 10:36.837
There's an assistant
in Holland's office.

10:36.904 --> 10:38.271
Interview
didn't yield anything,

10:38.338 --> 10:41.041
but J. Edgar jotted down
a description of her.

10:41.108 --> 10:45.612
Latina, late 20s.
Marissa Marta.

10:45.679 --> 10:46.747
Worth a shot.

10:46.814 --> 10:48.816
Excellent work,
Pierce.

10:48.882 --> 10:51.251
- But first...
- Owls.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.886
Fucking owls.

10:55.388 --> 10:56.389
Oh.

10:56.456 --> 10:58.591
Oh. Manna from heaven.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.761
Or the giant Seattle
conglomerate

11:00.828 --> 11:02.395
masquerading as such.

11:02.462 --> 11:03.697
How'd your turkey turn out?

11:03.764 --> 11:05.265
Don't ask.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.466
You getting anything?

11:06.533 --> 11:08.601
- Cataracts.
- Ahem.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.071
Seriously,
no car, no kid.

11:11.138 --> 11:13.073
We have to widen
our perimeter.

11:13.140 --> 11:16.043
Cross our I's
and dot our T's.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.711
Mm.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.713
Committed
a cold-blooded murder.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.882
- Yes.
- To discredit Harry Bosch

11:21.949 --> 11:24.451
- as a witness in their trial.
- Yes.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.518
Provable?

11:25.585 --> 11:27.988
Working on it.
We think yes.

11:28.889 --> 11:31.124
So Chief called you in.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.260
Ah. There's been
a mass freak-out at PAB--

11:33.326 --> 11:36.429
Chief Irving,
Rollins in West Bureau,

11:36.496 --> 11:37.898
Media Relations,

11:37.965 --> 11:39.800
and pretty much every
command staff drama queen

11:39.867 --> 11:41.034
- with nothing else to do.
- Believe me,

11:41.101 --> 11:43.070
there was no way
of controlling this story.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.337
You could have warned me.

11:44.404 --> 11:47.474
I wanted for you
to be able to say honestly

11:47.540 --> 11:48.942
that you knew nothing
about it.

11:49.009 --> 11:51.745
I mean, I was hoping that
my guys could prove the frame

11:51.812 --> 11:53.413
before it all blew up,
but if it did,

11:53.480 --> 11:55.315
I didn't want it
to get on you.

11:59.186 --> 12:01.154
RHD wants in on the frame.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.725
It's your call.

12:05.793 --> 12:07.060
I said no.

12:08.195 --> 12:09.629
But I do worry

12:09.696 --> 12:11.398
that this is
another example

12:11.464 --> 12:13.466
of your loose supervision
of your people.

12:13.533 --> 12:14.835
I will happily

12:14.902 --> 12:17.437
put my people's
case clearance rate

12:17.504 --> 12:19.907
up against any other
detective's in the city.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.075
You've seen the numbers.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.576
You know what we've done.

12:23.643 --> 12:25.078
It speaks for itself.

12:26.947 --> 12:30.450
And for the quality
of your command.

12:32.685 --> 12:34.421
You're too familiar
with them, Grace.

12:34.487 --> 12:35.755
You like them too much.

12:35.823 --> 12:38.826
If you need me to take
the heat with Chief Irving

12:38.892 --> 12:41.028
for my decision
to handle this in-house, I--

12:41.094 --> 12:45.198
No. It's above your rank,
Lieutenant.

12:50.737 --> 12:53.907
But fuck this up,
and it's on you.

12:55.575 --> 12:56.509
Captain.

13:14.895 --> 13:18.999
Ah. Well, welcome to my
jurisdictional nightmare.

13:19.066 --> 13:21.601
Better justify
the drive down here.

13:21.668 --> 13:23.470
Jerry's got
the Black Friday Blues.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.873
Black Friday. Is that,
uh-- that still a thing?

13:25.939 --> 13:27.607
Yes, it is, and mine
just got spoiled

13:27.674 --> 13:28.976
by a fed with a phone.

13:29.042 --> 13:31.644
Ah, probably find
whatever you need here.

13:31.711 --> 13:33.513
So-- ahem--

13:33.580 --> 13:35.482
Cornell "Merch" Jackson.

13:35.548 --> 13:37.084
U.S. Army. E5 Logistics.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.785
Found deceased
fully clothed.

13:38.852 --> 13:40.087
No sign of foul play.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.521
Except for
the being dead part.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.523
It's funny how our mind
always goes there

13:43.590 --> 13:44.591
when that happens.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.359
Uh, O.C. sheriff
got a warrant.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.328
Entire place was filled
with contraband

13:48.395 --> 13:51.331
evidently skimmed
from overseas shipments.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.700
A man called Merch
got to earn his handle.

13:53.766 --> 13:55.835
Here.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.137
Over here.

13:59.072 --> 14:00.874
More down this way.

14:05.879 --> 14:07.414
Oh. That's a nice haul.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.382
Yeah. Why do you think
I called you guys?

14:09.449 --> 14:11.351
Here he is--
Detective Vince Nguyen,

14:11.418 --> 14:13.120
O.C. Homicide.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.723
Hey. Detective Bosch,
Detective Edgar,

14:16.789 --> 14:18.125
LAPD Hollywood.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.492
Don't touch anything,
Hollywood.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.294
Don't even think
about touching anything.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.163
That's a sweet suit.
Is that new?

14:23.230 --> 14:25.332
What are you,
Fashion Police?

14:25.398 --> 14:26.967
I know my Italians.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.470
I got a soldier grifter
who accidentally drowned.

14:30.537 --> 14:31.538
What's your intersect?

14:31.604 --> 14:32.739
We're working a case,

14:32.805 --> 14:34.041
and we'd like to take a look

14:34.107 --> 14:35.608
at Jackson's most recent
embark records.

14:35.675 --> 14:36.643
So would we.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.645
Specialist Stykes is here

14:38.711 --> 14:39.846
to keep us
from getting eyes

14:39.913 --> 14:40.981
on anything classified

14:41.048 --> 14:42.282
until Army CID shows up

14:42.349 --> 14:44.217
to sort what we can
examine with our warrant.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.186
And Stykes was
Jackson's supervisor?

14:46.253 --> 14:48.188
Doesn't look old enough
to eat solid food.

14:48.255 --> 14:49.957
Honestly, I don't
think she knew fuck-all

14:50.023 --> 14:51.558
about what was
going on here.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.428
- Sergeant Stykes.
- Sir.

14:55.495 --> 14:59.032
Detective Bosch,
Detective Edgar,
LAPD.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.633
We think Specialist Jackson
might be connected

15:00.700 --> 15:02.035
to a caper up in Hollywood.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.470
Sirs, I'm sorry,
but I can't let you

15:03.536 --> 15:05.438
go through any of this
until CID gets here.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.941
It'll be something
that came in recently,

15:08.008 --> 15:10.243
private military
contractors.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.012
Wouldn't know anything
about that, sir.

15:12.079 --> 15:14.014
You and Merch hang out?

15:14.081 --> 15:16.583
Drink beer, talk shop?

15:16.649 --> 15:18.385
No, sir.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.253
I have a fiancé.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.590
Jerry.

15:23.656 --> 15:26.226
Uh, please do not touch
anything on the table.

15:26.293 --> 15:30.130
Hey, hey, hey. Come on.
I said don't touch anything.

15:30.197 --> 15:31.431
What is that?

15:31.498 --> 15:33.700
That is motive.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.537
Looks like Merch was
just another loose end.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.372
What do you want to bet
your contractors

15:39.439 --> 15:41.674
ripped off some corrupt
Afghan war lord

15:41.741 --> 15:43.076
they were paid to babysit?

15:43.143 --> 15:44.944
So no record of the
cash ever existing.

15:45.012 --> 15:46.279
That's right.
Fog of war, baby.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.182
Ah, here comes the cavalry.

15:49.249 --> 15:50.717
You guys are getting out
just in time.

15:50.783 --> 15:53.553
Me, I got a full day of
inter-agency clusterfucking.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.588
- Good luck with that.
- Yeah.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.825
DA wants us downtown.

15:58.891 --> 16:00.693
Us?

16:34.861 --> 16:36.029
Oh, yeah.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.397
Definitely one of ours.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.466
- Can I touch it?
- Sure.

16:39.532 --> 16:40.833
Ah.

16:40.900 --> 16:43.236
Yeah,
it's been customized.

16:44.571 --> 16:47.607
Carol, would you bring me
one of the 414s?

16:47.674 --> 16:48.808
Mm-hmm.

16:48.875 --> 16:51.044
Yeah, somebody's
painted over it.

16:51.978 --> 16:53.680
Professional.

16:53.746 --> 16:55.048
Professional
owl painting.

16:55.115 --> 16:58.185
Well, artful anyhow.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.253
Not some slapdash amateur.

17:06.093 --> 17:07.594
Yeah.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.429
See what I mean?

17:09.496 --> 17:10.763
Yeah.

17:10.830 --> 17:13.466
We're hoping to trace this owl
to the person who bought it.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.035
Well, I'll open my books
for you if you like,

17:16.103 --> 17:19.472
but, uh,
we sell several thousand
of these units each year,

17:19.539 --> 17:21.974
and almost all of them
are in big box stores

17:22.041 --> 17:23.943
or online garden sites.

17:24.010 --> 17:25.345
Wholesaling
or retailing?

17:25.412 --> 17:28.047
Ah, almost no contact
with the end user,

17:28.115 --> 17:29.449
unless there's a defect.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.318
You know,
all our products

17:31.384 --> 17:33.786
are 100% money back
guaranteed,

17:33.853 --> 17:35.888
but, uh, not
if you alter them.

17:35.955 --> 17:37.724
Why don't you give us a list

17:37.790 --> 17:40.360
of the local brick and mortar
that sell your owls?

17:40.427 --> 17:41.728
Maybe we'll get lucky.

17:41.794 --> 17:43.496
Okay.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.931
I can tell you
that one was bought

17:44.997 --> 17:45.998
in the last three months.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.100
How do you know?

17:47.167 --> 17:48.635
We changed the mold,

17:48.701 --> 17:51.671
uh, fixed the horns,
leveled the eyes.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.374
Those new units
shipped, uh, September,

17:54.441 --> 17:57.577
so had to be since then.

17:57.644 --> 17:58.478
Okay.

17:58.545 --> 18:00.380
That's helpful.
Thank you.

18:00.447 --> 18:01.514
Mm-hmm.

18:03.049 --> 18:04.317
Hey.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.486
Whoever dolled up that bird,

18:06.553 --> 18:09.088
tell him he's got a bright
future in pest control.

18:15.362 --> 18:17.830
This is exactly what
I've been harping on.

18:17.897 --> 18:19.266
You are your own
worst enemy.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.201
- The frame won't hold up.
- Doesn't matter.

18:21.268 --> 18:24.103
By the time it falls apart,
it'll be too late.

18:26.973 --> 18:28.275
How long have you known?

18:34.347 --> 18:35.715
You didn't tell her?

18:37.817 --> 18:40.353
He didn't know.
He was never a suspect.

18:40.420 --> 18:43.223
Oh. Right.
Of course not.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.392
Hollywood Station
is one big society

18:45.458 --> 18:48.295
for the protection of
Harry motherfucking Bosch.

18:51.130 --> 18:54.767
When is your motion hearing
on Bosch's checkered history?

18:54.834 --> 18:56.035
Next week.

18:56.102 --> 18:58.305
You're going to lose it.

19:03.210 --> 19:04.511
Pull Bosch.

19:05.512 --> 19:06.646
Put Edgar on the stand.

19:06.713 --> 19:09.115
Detective Edgar
didn't hear Holland

19:09.182 --> 19:10.583
admit that he
committed the murder.

19:10.650 --> 19:11.818
What do you want
from me, Anita?

19:11.884 --> 19:13.286
Your lead cop is toxic.

19:13.353 --> 19:14.621
Work around it.

19:14.687 --> 19:15.622
I am trying--

19:15.688 --> 19:17.123
Jesus,
you're such a coward.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.325
Fowkkes should give you
a special thanks

19:18.391 --> 19:19.459
at his closing argument.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.127
I'm not going to
get caught short

19:21.194 --> 19:22.262
at trial again
because of you.

19:22.329 --> 19:24.364
They killed Gunn
for the frame.

19:31.137 --> 19:35.208
Prove it
before the jury sits.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.783
Did you ever reach Annabelle?

19:43.850 --> 19:44.917
Headed there next.

19:44.984 --> 19:46.219
Heading there?

19:46.286 --> 19:47.920
Harry, she's essential
to us now.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.121
I asked you to pl--

19:49.188 --> 19:50.323
Going there next.

19:50.390 --> 19:51.458
My job doesn't stop

19:51.524 --> 19:52.859
just because
you've got a trial.

19:52.925 --> 19:54.126
Wow.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.762
I'm sorry.
I guess I forgot.

19:55.828 --> 19:57.129
Forgot what?

19:57.196 --> 19:58.998
Harry Bosch.
You do what you do.

19:59.065 --> 20:00.600
The world adjusts.

20:05.472 --> 20:06.973
Something
you want to say?

20:07.039 --> 20:08.207
Nope.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.345
No way to get
the money back.

20:12.412 --> 20:13.813
Police
were already there.

20:14.947 --> 20:16.616
Nothing I could
do about it.

20:16.683 --> 20:19.252
Cops grind.
It's in their DNA.

20:19.319 --> 20:20.487
Got to respect it.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.622
Took the money
from a bacha bazi.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.424
The Pentagon
should give us medals.

20:24.491 --> 20:25.658
Hey, who's the one
that said

20:25.725 --> 20:27.527
this old guy was
nothing to worry about?

20:27.594 --> 20:31.063
That was before
he kept showing up
like a bad acid flashback?

20:32.665 --> 20:36.869
Look, stay mindful.
Stay disciplined,

20:36.936 --> 20:38.070
on mission.

20:38.137 --> 20:39.739
We're good.

20:39.806 --> 20:42.542
If I see him again,
I don't know.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.612
The weed's talking shit
to you, Woodrow.

20:47.146 --> 20:49.649
Go surf. Chill.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.185
Yeah.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.087
Hey, put this
somewhere safe, huh?

20:55.154 --> 20:56.789
Duh.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.642
Print was on the side
of the camera housing.

21:15.708 --> 21:18.745
From all the dust over it,
probably not new.

21:18.811 --> 21:20.313
The guy who set up the system.

21:20.380 --> 21:21.581
That would be
my first guess.

21:21.648 --> 21:23.650
When he unpacked it,
maybe no gloves.

21:23.716 --> 21:25.184
You run it?

21:25.251 --> 21:26.919
Am I the detective?

21:28.120 --> 21:29.556
Of course I ran it.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.524
Got a name and CI number.

21:31.591 --> 21:36.228
Ooh. Mark Taylor.
LAUSD teacher.

21:36.295 --> 21:39.165
Yeah, that's
where his prints got
on the system anyway.

21:39.231 --> 21:41.267
No arrest history?

21:41.334 --> 21:42.802
This is about
your partner, huh?

21:42.869 --> 21:44.236
What is?

21:44.303 --> 21:46.539
Come on.
Off-book with the camera.

21:46.606 --> 21:47.840
Now all these rumors
about Bosch.

21:47.907 --> 21:49.909
- I put 2 and 2 together.
- And got 7.

21:49.976 --> 21:53.446
No, Miguel.
There's nothing there.

21:53.513 --> 21:55.047
I owe you one.

21:56.215 --> 21:57.484
No shit.

22:22.942 --> 22:23.943
Annabelle in?

22:24.010 --> 22:26.345
Are you, uh...

22:26.413 --> 22:28.681
you one of the
geezers she's boning?

22:30.517 --> 22:33.085
- LAPD.
- Ah. Shit.

22:33.152 --> 22:34.721
Sorry.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.889
Uh, she-- she's in Prague.

22:36.956 --> 22:39.191
I'm-- I'm a sublet.

22:39.258 --> 22:40.460
Prague?

22:40.527 --> 22:41.828
Yeah.
Booked this sweet gig

22:41.894 --> 22:43.696
on a series about
about witches and shit,

22:43.763 --> 22:46.433
uh, Spanish Inquisition.

22:46.499 --> 22:48.034
Eight-month shoot.

22:49.502 --> 22:51.003
She in trouble?

22:51.070 --> 22:52.371
I'd say so.

23:03.950 --> 23:06.118
You've reached
Deputy DA Anita Benitez.

23:06.185 --> 23:08.821
Leave a message and a number
I can contact you.

23:09.822 --> 23:12.425
It's me. Crowe's a problem.

23:12.492 --> 23:14.927
I'm around tonight
if you want to talk.

23:42.922 --> 23:45.825
Hi. Yeah.
Detective Jerry Edgar,

23:45.892 --> 23:47.026
Hollywood.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.195
I need to locate an order--

23:49.261 --> 23:51.864
the murder books
on an old 187.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.767
Lester Smith.
Assault case.

23:54.834 --> 23:57.637
Yeah. I have
the DR number right here.

23:59.171 --> 24:01.307
I can just get a ride
home from practice, Dad.

24:01.373 --> 24:03.342
Lauren's mom said you can
stay at their house

24:03.409 --> 24:04.577
until I'm done today.

24:04.644 --> 24:06.278
You called Lauren's mom?

24:06.345 --> 24:07.880
I feel like I'm
under house arrest.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.115
Aw, Mads, come on.

24:09.181 --> 24:10.850
Did you talk to Mom
about the travel team?

24:10.917 --> 24:12.418
- Detective Bosch.
- I got to let Coach know.

24:12.485 --> 24:13.853
Detective Bosch,
what's the real story

24:13.920 --> 24:15.454
with this Gunn murder
you're a part of?

24:15.522 --> 24:17.023
You guys couldn't find
a Kardashian to creep?

24:17.089 --> 24:18.124
Are you his daughter?

24:18.190 --> 24:19.425
So, Bosch, this guy,

24:19.492 --> 24:20.727
you're chasing him
for years.

24:20.793 --> 24:21.961
He just turns up dead.

24:22.028 --> 24:23.696
You don't see
the coincidence in that?

24:23.763 --> 24:25.031
No? No comment?

24:25.097 --> 24:26.499
Detective, Andrew Holland
has tweeted

24:26.566 --> 24:29.001
that you're a serial liar.
No comments?

24:29.068 --> 24:30.837
Tweet this, asshole.

24:37.309 --> 24:38.678
Best not to engage.

24:38.745 --> 24:40.446
Uch. Like you'd know.

24:40.513 --> 24:41.814
What does that mean?

24:41.881 --> 24:43.516
Where do you think
I learned it?

24:44.483 --> 24:46.218
You said you wanted
to be a cop.

24:46.285 --> 24:47.520
Eyes on the road.

24:47.587 --> 24:49.155
10 and 2.

24:51.658 --> 24:54.226
Sometimes getting in the way
is part of the job.

24:54.293 --> 24:57.029
Pissing people off
comes with the territory.

24:57.096 --> 24:58.598
Your territory.

25:01.167 --> 25:03.936
How come Jerry never has
stupid stuff happen to him?

25:04.003 --> 25:05.872
I don't know.

25:05.938 --> 25:07.840
Maybe he's just not
as pretty as I am.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.753
If only plastic owls
could talk.

25:53.820 --> 25:56.522
Oh, it would save me
from this, for sure.

25:56.589 --> 25:58.791
I've got 17 local stores
left to contact

25:58.858 --> 26:00.259
about sales records.

26:00.326 --> 26:02.228
Anything new on Gunn's?

26:02.294 --> 26:04.664
A couple of decent prints
we missed the first time.

26:04.731 --> 26:08.635
Entry, door, face plate,
and latch bolt.

26:08.701 --> 26:12.104
Like, whoever broke in
held his finger up against it

26:12.171 --> 26:13.405
after he picked it open.

26:13.472 --> 26:15.708
Security chain.

26:15.775 --> 26:18.077
Potter noticed the top
of the door was scuffed.

26:18.144 --> 26:20.813
Killer snagged the chain
with fishing line,

26:20.880 --> 26:23.482
looped it up over the door,
and slid the guard frame.

26:23.549 --> 26:25.718
Sounds like a two-man job.

26:25.785 --> 26:28.020
Sounds like an assumption.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.555
Educated guess.

26:29.622 --> 26:31.691
When you do it,
it's an educated guess,

26:31.758 --> 26:33.192
but when I do it,
it's an assumption?

26:37.764 --> 26:39.632
Got to be cash
they shipped back.

26:39.699 --> 26:40.867
All the pieces line up.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.001
- Not this cash, though.
- No.

26:42.068 --> 26:43.302
Too long ago,
but probably

26:43.369 --> 26:45.271
where they got the idea
in the first place.

26:45.337 --> 26:48.007
Goshen says there's
more money floating
around Afghanistan now

26:48.074 --> 26:49.976
than there was in Iraq.
Less oversight.

26:50.042 --> 26:53.545
But why not, I don't know,
drugs or weapons?

26:53.612 --> 26:54.781
Anything else they bring in

26:54.847 --> 26:56.082
they're going to take
a huge hit on

26:56.148 --> 26:57.583
when they try
to sell it here.

26:57.650 --> 26:58.885
Cash is cash.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.452
Yeah, but they still
have to launder it.

27:00.519 --> 27:03.656
Well, but nobody gives a shit
about that on this end,

27:03.723 --> 27:05.692
except for maybe the taxes.

27:05.758 --> 27:07.093
Perfect crime.

27:08.260 --> 27:09.729
Till Sharkey unraveled it.

27:16.168 --> 27:17.203
Where have you been?

27:17.269 --> 27:19.438
There's a Crowe problem?

27:19.505 --> 27:21.674
She's in Europe
shooting a TV show.

27:21.741 --> 27:23.609
Harry, damn it.

27:23.676 --> 27:25.912
God. If you
would've just--

27:25.978 --> 27:27.513
There was nothing
we could have done.

27:27.579 --> 27:28.748
This is pure Holland.

27:28.815 --> 27:30.416
He pulled some strings,
got her a part.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.819
She was probably making
her connection at Frankfurt

27:32.885 --> 27:34.854
while you were still
leaving her messages.

27:36.022 --> 27:38.124
They tampered
with my fucking witness.

27:38.190 --> 27:40.459
Add that to all the other
things we have to prove.

27:40.526 --> 27:41.928
We get together tonight?

27:41.994 --> 27:44.130
Figure out where we're
going to go from here?

27:44.196 --> 27:47.700
I can't. I'm sorry.

27:48.735 --> 27:50.069
Okay. Tomorrow?

27:50.136 --> 27:52.604
I'll see how my day goes.

28:01.313 --> 28:02.949
We should put eyes
on Dobbs and Marino

28:03.015 --> 28:04.951
in case
they try to book.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.385
Billets is going
to pitch a fit

28:06.452 --> 28:07.820
about extra bodies
on overtime.

28:07.887 --> 28:09.521
You're already
in the doghouse.

28:09.588 --> 28:12.558
I'll write it up
if you pretend
it was your idea.

28:12.624 --> 28:13.860
Swell.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.702
Love that holiday vibe,

28:23.770 --> 28:25.504
all the festive
traditions.

28:25.571 --> 28:27.573
Those special smells.

28:41.754 --> 28:44.256
Detective,
Chief would like a word.

28:44.323 --> 28:47.226
I'm guessing
he means you.

28:47.293 --> 28:50.129
Note the time and date
in case I never come back.

28:51.363 --> 28:52.464
Wash.

29:13.319 --> 29:14.686
J. Edgar.

29:14.753 --> 29:15.955
What's up?

29:16.022 --> 29:17.824
Quick question about Bosch.

29:26.498 --> 29:27.766
I'm starting to understand

29:27.834 --> 29:29.902
why you and LT
like the guy so much.

29:29.969 --> 29:32.872
He's smart, loyal.

29:32.939 --> 29:34.706
He's a pretty
damn good detective

29:34.773 --> 29:36.308
if you push past
the dark part.

29:36.375 --> 29:38.744
Plays it too close
to the edge for my taste,

29:38.811 --> 29:41.380
but okay.

29:41.447 --> 29:43.049
He gets results.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.283
Where is this going,
Jimmy?

29:44.350 --> 29:46.618
Well, I can't stop
asking myself

29:46.685 --> 29:48.888
what Bosch knows
about Gunn

29:48.955 --> 29:50.356
he isn't telling us.

29:50.422 --> 29:51.457
Ask him.

29:51.523 --> 29:52.992
Have you?

29:54.560 --> 29:56.328
This doesn't get us to who
killed the man, Jimmy.

29:56.395 --> 29:59.832
Come on. Nobody wants
to be in a position

29:59.899 --> 30:01.367
where the guy
who's got your back

30:01.433 --> 30:02.869
- can't be straight with you.
- You know what?

30:02.935 --> 30:04.236
I really
don't feel comfortable

30:04.303 --> 30:05.872
having this conversation
with you about my partner.

30:05.938 --> 30:07.239
Hey, believe me,
I've got no skin in.

30:07.306 --> 30:09.008
I'm just passing
through, but--

30:09.075 --> 30:10.409
Let me guess-- RHD.

30:10.476 --> 30:13.679
Yeah. Short list
for the next desk,

30:13.745 --> 30:14.813
or so they say.

30:14.881 --> 30:16.115
Great. Just make sure

30:16.182 --> 30:19.718
you don't step over Harry
to get there.

30:19.785 --> 30:20.987
That's not what this is.

30:21.053 --> 30:22.321
I hope not.

30:33.866 --> 30:35.501
May I ask
where we're going?

30:37.736 --> 30:39.238
In circles.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.042
Should be a familiar
journey for you.

30:47.713 --> 30:50.482
Harry Bosch,
Detective 3.

30:52.718 --> 30:55.021
Nearly 10,000
sworn officers

30:55.087 --> 30:57.123
in the Los Angeles
Police Department.

30:59.158 --> 31:01.393
Tell me why I spend
so much of my time

31:01.460 --> 31:04.296
dealing with the shit
you stir up?

31:05.998 --> 31:08.034
I just try
to keep my head down,

31:08.100 --> 31:09.568
do my job, Chief.

31:11.003 --> 31:13.139
Not even remotely true.

31:15.607 --> 31:16.675
Which, of course,

31:16.742 --> 31:18.110
is the quality
that recommends you

31:18.177 --> 31:20.146
and indicts you,
depending.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.981
Those qualities
weren't a problem

31:22.048 --> 31:23.349
when you needed my help.

31:27.086 --> 31:29.021
I'd like not to hear
the name Bosch

31:29.088 --> 31:30.622
in my morning
briefing anymore.

31:32.191 --> 31:34.826
How can we
make that happen?

31:34.893 --> 31:37.029
You could always fire me.

31:38.430 --> 31:39.498
Short of that.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.101
Sir, I have no control

31:42.168 --> 31:44.303
over what people
do or say about me.

31:44.370 --> 31:47.239
If you're expecting me
to cut you slack

31:47.306 --> 31:49.241
for your current
misadventures,
you're mistaken.

31:49.308 --> 31:50.642
I do not expect anything.

31:50.709 --> 31:51.978
Oh, I think you do.

31:52.044 --> 31:53.545
And I think
if you're not careful,

31:53.612 --> 31:55.181
it will eat you alive.

32:10.729 --> 32:12.631
Thanks for the ride.

32:12.698 --> 32:14.233
Any time.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.292
See you after practice.

32:42.761 --> 32:44.896
What did you do
with the ticket
I gave you, Harry?

32:44.963 --> 32:46.498
Didn't it get tossed?

32:46.565 --> 32:48.500
I got a reminder notice
in the mail yesterday.

32:48.567 --> 32:51.703
- Ah, shit.
- They're going to drop
an arrest warrant on me.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.172
I tried. I'm sorry.

32:53.239 --> 32:55.974
It's all these new
rules and regulations.

32:56.042 --> 32:57.809
Okay, but, y--

32:57.876 --> 32:59.178
In the old days,

32:59.245 --> 33:00.879
I could have just reached
out to the motor cop,

33:00.946 --> 33:02.648
have him bang in sick
on the day of court.

33:02.714 --> 33:05.884
- Okay, but, I mean--
- You know, they've
clipped our nuts, Phil.

33:05.951 --> 33:08.054
So now you're the one
that's got to pay the ticket.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.589
It's criminal.
Have a better one.

33:53.832 --> 33:54.833
Ms. Marta?

33:54.900 --> 33:56.268
That's me.

33:56.335 --> 33:58.737
Santiago Robertson,
LAPD.

33:58.804 --> 34:01.273
Your name bumped up in a case
we're investigating.

34:01.340 --> 34:03.142
I'd like to ask you
a couple of questions.

34:03.209 --> 34:05.477
- Now?
- Yes.

34:07.279 --> 34:09.815
- Can you give me a minute?
- Sure.

34:20.726 --> 34:24.830
Bosch. Hi.
Amy Snyder.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.798
This, uh,
128 complaint--

34:26.865 --> 34:28.066
I want a rep.

34:29.601 --> 34:31.170
Fine. Who?

34:33.305 --> 34:35.874
Sergeant Mankiewicz.

34:37.209 --> 34:39.845
Great. Great.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.747
Okay. Well,
you two let me know

34:41.813 --> 34:43.315
when and where
by tomorrow.

34:43.382 --> 34:45.217
Or I'll make
an insubordination
notification

34:45.284 --> 34:46.318
to your captain,

34:46.385 --> 34:47.686
and we'll go
from there.

34:54.726 --> 34:56.228
She wants a lawyer.

34:57.129 --> 34:58.230
She doesn't need one.

34:58.297 --> 35:00.699
Tell him you want a lawyer.

35:02.201 --> 35:04.035
Tafero, right?

35:04.102 --> 35:06.037
Rudy?

35:06.104 --> 35:09.040
I recognize
the ex-cop sack.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.877
She wants a lawyer,
detective.

35:15.381 --> 35:17.283
I'm just trying to clarify.

35:17.349 --> 35:19.651
A month ago, you bailed
a man named Edward Gunn

35:19.718 --> 35:21.753
- out of Rampart Jail.
- I didn't know him.

35:21.820 --> 35:23.855
I just brought cash
to the bondsman.

35:23.922 --> 35:25.157
A favor for a friend.

35:25.224 --> 35:26.725
Marissa, say
the magic words.

35:26.792 --> 35:29.428
And anyway, it's one of your
cops who killed him.

35:30.496 --> 35:31.897
What's
the friend's name?

35:33.832 --> 35:35.301
I want a lawyer.

35:36.535 --> 35:37.769
See?

35:46.245 --> 35:47.546
Bosch went Dirty Harry

35:47.613 --> 35:50.249
on a freak
he couldn't convict.

35:50.316 --> 35:53.385
Now it's come out,
and he's a walking IVD.

35:53.452 --> 35:55.921
I suggest you duck
and cover, amigo.

35:55.987 --> 35:58.056
The shit storm
is just starting.

35:58.123 --> 35:59.825
Maybe I should be
talking to you

35:59.891 --> 36:01.026
about Edward Gunn, Rudy.

36:01.092 --> 36:03.829
I'd want a lawyer.

36:03.895 --> 36:05.864
Sure.

36:05.931 --> 36:07.666
Pardon the interruptus.

36:07.733 --> 36:11.670
I trust you got
another little blue pill.

36:21.247 --> 36:23.749
Out of stock? Fuck.

36:23.815 --> 36:25.284
Ships after Christmas.

36:25.351 --> 36:26.618
It's not even December.
That's bullshit.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.387
Hey, hey, language, Mister.

36:28.454 --> 36:30.589
Don't mess with me. I'm in
the middle of a bid, Harry.

36:30.656 --> 36:32.258
You should have shopped
Black Friday.

36:32.324 --> 36:34.025
Isn't that when all
the best deals are done?

36:34.092 --> 36:35.561
That's what I keep
telling him.

36:37.629 --> 36:39.531
So listen, your request
for surveillance

36:39.598 --> 36:41.733
on the suspects
in the Meadows caper--

36:41.800 --> 36:43.635
I can't do it. Sorry.

36:44.603 --> 36:46.071
Three homicides down.

36:46.137 --> 36:47.673
One of them's
a 16-year-old kid.

36:47.739 --> 36:50.141
You don't even know for sure
if they got their shipment yet.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.543
We don't want
to lose these guys.

36:51.610 --> 36:52.978
If you and Bosch
can find time

36:53.044 --> 36:55.281
in your eight-hour day
to sit and watch them,

36:55.347 --> 36:56.982
then knock yourselves out.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.216
But I can't justify

36:58.284 --> 36:59.551
the extra manpower
and overtime

36:59.618 --> 37:01.687
until you get something
more concrete.

37:04.523 --> 37:05.991
Same as it ever was.

37:06.057 --> 37:08.327
Cut her some slack, Harry.

37:11.229 --> 37:12.464
Damn!

37:17.002 --> 37:19.338
Composite went out
wider than we hoped.

37:19.405 --> 37:20.972
Now we're spending
half our time

37:21.039 --> 37:22.408
vetting calls
from patrol cops

37:22.474 --> 37:24.443
convinced they found our guy.

37:24.510 --> 37:27.112
Though it was a gamble
in a serial case.

37:27.178 --> 37:29.114
And the DNA?

37:29.180 --> 37:30.416
We've asked DOJ

37:30.482 --> 37:32.551
for an expedited
familial database run.

37:32.618 --> 37:34.219
We'll see if we can
find a relative,

37:34.286 --> 37:35.654
work that way.

37:35.721 --> 37:37.889
They giving you
the usual runaround?

37:39.090 --> 37:40.926
Let me make a call.

37:40.992 --> 37:42.160
This is so fucked up.

37:42.227 --> 37:43.662
If he goes
to ground again,

37:43.729 --> 37:45.731
we'll be waiting
for the next kill
to catch him.

37:45.797 --> 37:48.500
Try not to lose focus.
Do what you can.

37:49.535 --> 37:51.370
Also thought that we
get K-town Motors,

37:51.437 --> 37:53.271
start jamming
everybody on a bike.

37:53.339 --> 37:54.906
But West Traffic's
giving us static.

37:54.973 --> 37:57.008
It's a good idea.

37:57.075 --> 37:58.977
I can clear that up
for you two.

38:02.381 --> 38:03.549
Chief Irving.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.684
Great minds think
alike, I guess.

38:05.751 --> 38:06.552
How's that?

38:06.618 --> 38:08.520
Thought I'd drop in,

38:08.587 --> 38:10.021
go through
the investigation,

38:10.088 --> 38:11.289
see what I can recommend.

38:11.357 --> 38:12.724
You beat me to it.

38:12.791 --> 38:15.761
No. No, I was just trying
to see how I could help.

38:17.429 --> 38:19.665
All right. Thanks, Chief.

38:22.334 --> 38:23.935
Nestor, I, uh,

38:24.002 --> 38:26.472
I heard the rumor you've
been fast tracked for chief.

38:26.538 --> 38:27.706
Congratulations.

38:28.607 --> 38:30.241
I appreciate that, Irv.

38:30.308 --> 38:31.643
Big shoes to fill.

38:31.710 --> 38:34.112
Yeah. Well, I got to tell you.

38:34.179 --> 38:36.748
I don't agree with everyone
saying you're too young.

38:52.498 --> 38:53.965
This is Pierce.

38:55.300 --> 38:56.435
Ah, awesome.

38:56.502 --> 38:58.770
I've been waiting
on that print. Go.

39:00.271 --> 39:01.773
Hold on.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.075
You sure
about that first name?

39:04.142 --> 39:07.178
**

39:07.245 --> 39:09.147
Take me to Cabo.

39:09.214 --> 39:11.650
Convénzame.

39:27.132 --> 39:30.001
Yo. Get a room, puta.

39:37.976 --> 39:39.044
What?

39:39.110 --> 39:42.548
You one of those pussy-ass
18th Street vatos?

39:45.617 --> 39:48.253
Longo gang,
or don't bang, ese.

39:48.319 --> 39:49.688
Ooh.

39:58.163 --> 39:59.397
He'll live.

40:07.506 --> 40:08.940
He's right.

40:10.476 --> 40:13.044
Let's take this
horizontal, girl.

40:22.721 --> 40:24.055
You will never
in a million years

40:24.122 --> 40:25.957
guess who's been giving
the high hard one

40:26.024 --> 40:27.092
to Holland's assistant.

40:27.158 --> 40:28.226
Tafero?

40:28.293 --> 40:29.895
Yeah. How'd you--

40:29.961 --> 40:31.062
But which one?

40:31.129 --> 40:32.498
Wait a minute.

40:32.564 --> 40:34.733
You mean there's
more than one?

40:46.244 --> 40:47.913
- Bosch.
- Harry,

40:47.979 --> 40:50.448
we got a match on the new
print from the door at Gunn's.

40:50.516 --> 40:51.583
Tell it.

40:51.650 --> 40:52.784
Jesse Tafero.

40:52.851 --> 40:55.020
Shit. Younger brother.

40:55.086 --> 40:57.088
- Do you know him?
- No.

40:57.155 --> 40:58.356
Only that Rudy had one.

40:58.423 --> 41:00.158
Me and Pierce
are dropping the hammer

41:00.225 --> 41:01.326
on Jesse tomorrow.

41:01.392 --> 41:03.161
Shake him,
see what falls out.

41:03.228 --> 41:04.496
You want in?

41:07.365 --> 41:08.834
You want me in?

41:08.900 --> 41:09.935
Yeah.

41:10.001 --> 41:13.739
It seems you have special
insight on this one.

41:14.973 --> 41:16.908
I got a court thing
early in the morning.

41:16.975 --> 41:19.645
No problem. It'll give us
time to track him down.

41:19.711 --> 41:21.980
Guess you can cross me
off your suspect list.

41:22.047 --> 41:24.249
Yeah. You'd think.

41:47.739 --> 41:49.741
That thing with those
tabloid idiots went online,

41:49.808 --> 41:51.409
and Becca thought
it would be crazy awesome

41:51.476 --> 41:53.344
to make a gif of me
flipping them off.

41:53.411 --> 41:54.946
Now it's all over the school.

41:55.814 --> 41:57.215
Is that good or bad?

41:57.282 --> 41:58.216
Uhh.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.690
Oh. You're talking
to me again.

42:04.756 --> 42:06.558
When was I not
talking to you?

42:09.795 --> 42:12.598
Becca's dad got in my
grid square this morning.

42:12.664 --> 42:14.132
Yeah, I heard.

42:14.199 --> 42:16.367
You didn't really try
to fix his ticket, did you?

42:16.434 --> 42:18.303
I did not.

42:19.370 --> 42:20.572
I didn't think you did.

42:20.639 --> 42:21.973
Why is that?

42:22.040 --> 42:25.043
You're kind of hard core
about the rules.

42:25.110 --> 42:26.578
For other people.

42:28.246 --> 42:30.916
Am I going to create flak
for you and Becca's crew?

42:30.982 --> 42:33.284
I'm so over them right now.

42:34.753 --> 42:35.954
So maybe
it's a good reason

42:36.021 --> 42:37.555
not to join
the travel team.

42:37.623 --> 42:40.225
Becca didn't get asked
to join the travel team.

42:47.365 --> 42:48.700
Everything
all right with you?

42:50.135 --> 42:51.202
Yeah.

42:52.838 --> 42:54.439
You going out tonight?

42:54.505 --> 42:56.374
No.

42:56.441 --> 42:57.609
Why not?

42:59.244 --> 43:00.846
Things change.

43:04.716 --> 43:06.017
You're like a turtle.

43:07.085 --> 43:08.920
Your shell's
where you're safe,

43:08.987 --> 43:11.589
but nobody gets
under there with you.

43:11.657 --> 43:13.591
Not really.

43:15.694 --> 43:16.928
Not even me.

43:21.399 --> 43:23.001
Is that
what it feels like?

43:25.436 --> 43:26.838
Sometimes.

43:37.816 --> 43:40.786
Got to have ice cream
on it, right?

43:47.625 --> 43:49.961
Shit. Shoot. Sorry.

43:50.028 --> 43:52.964
Relax.
I'll get you a new setup.
