00:23.273 --> 00:26.901
- Got a present for you.
- Who is it?

00:27.069 --> 00:28.903
- Sammy.
- Sammy the Bull?

00:29.071 --> 00:30.905
Sammy the Knife. I diced him up.

00:31.073 --> 00:34.450
Did you clean him? Ah, man!

00:35.536 --> 00:38.538
You're coming back for this weekend?
All right. Good luck.

01:03.147 --> 01:07.734
Damn, Vince. Cheap, leaky bags! Shit!

01:23.584 --> 01:25.001
Shit!

01:26.170 --> 01:28.087
You've looked better, Sammy.

02:06.919 --> 02:08.544
Hey, baby, how you doing?

02:09.880 --> 02:13.424
- Can I ask an important question?
- Sure.

02:13.592 --> 02:16.385
Where directly the fuck
have you been all week?

02:16.553 --> 02:17.678
Working.

02:17.846 --> 02:20.139
Looks like your ass is still working.

02:20.307 --> 02:23.142
I'm doing a favour for Vince.
He got that thing this weekend.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.645
Melvin, you're doing
this shit for free!

02:25.813 --> 02:28.064
You have a mortgage to pay
and my car note!

02:28.232 --> 02:31.609
Did you see these notices?
Will you look at this shit?

02:32.611 --> 02:37.365
Take care of your responsibilities
instead of doing favours for co-workers!

02:37.533 --> 02:40.368
You're down at least 25 grand.

02:40.536 --> 02:43.204
- Twenty-five grand?
- Yeah, baby!

02:43.372 --> 02:47.333
- How did that happen?
- That's considering the mortgage.

02:51.797 --> 02:54.090
The note on my Jag.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.261
And all the other expenses.

03:07.479 --> 03:09.438
He's kind of cute. Who is that?

03:09.606 --> 03:12.358
That's Sammy the Knife,
one of Costanzo's crew.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.361
That shit turns me off.

03:15.529 --> 03:19.615
Vince is gonna be here on Saturday
to pick him up so I'm leaving him here.

03:19.783 --> 03:22.451
- Are you going out this weekend?
- Maybe.

03:22.619 --> 03:25.913
- Where's your fiancé?
- All right. Shit!

04:31.188 --> 04:35.524
- You trying to clown me?
- I'm serious, dog. I've seen the light.

04:35.692 --> 04:38.611
Check out the six-pack!
Looking kind of diesel, kid.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.364
I get my workout swerve
on six days a week.

04:41.531 --> 04:46.911
You telling me you never jerked
your dick in your life until last week?

04:47.079 --> 04:49.413
That's bullshit, man.

04:49.581 --> 04:51.874
I never needed to.

04:52.042 --> 04:54.794
I've been fucking since I was ten.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.879
I can relate to that.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.714
- Cisco!
- Cisco, yo.

04:58.882 --> 05:02.009
I can't wear green. Clashes with
my eyes. Look good on you, though.

05:02.177 --> 05:04.470
Bust a move, man.
We're gonna be late.

05:04.638 --> 05:07.014
- Shit. Yo, Vinnie, you hear the news?
- What's that?

05:07.182 --> 05:11.852
This fool claim he don't bone females
since he discovered ringing his rag.

05:12.020 --> 05:15.856
- Is that true?
- No doubt. It's lower maintenance.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.862
Mel is like me. He loves to bump bag.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.907
He's got two of the sweetest...

05:25.075 --> 05:29.745
If anybody needs to make a switch
to straight jacking, it's Mel.

05:29.913 --> 05:32.957
Both of them chickenheads
is taking my man to the cleaners.

05:33.125 --> 05:34.959
Especially Chantel.

05:35.127 --> 05:40.423
The way I see it, with the loot I saved
and the money I'll clock this weekend...

05:40.590 --> 05:43.551
...should be able to put the final
payment down on that Grande Pinoche.

05:43.719 --> 05:47.263
Sail that baby around the world!
Can you imagine that?

05:47.431 --> 05:51.434
Damn Caribbean. Mediterranean.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.602
South Seas.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.146
Sounds great.

05:57.441 --> 06:00.693
You need to get in on that weekend job
with me, Crunch and Gump.

06:00.861 --> 06:04.321
- We could use a fourth.
- I got that thing this weekend.

06:04.489 --> 06:08.159
Oh, well.
All right, gentlemen, synchronize.

06:38.482 --> 06:41.400
- You know the drill, baby.
- Word is bond.

07:24.694 --> 07:28.030
As agreed.
Three blondes under 20.

07:28.198 --> 07:31.575
Midwestern. No tattoos.

07:31.743 --> 07:34.286
- How much?
- Fifty thousand apiece.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.871
Fifty thousand?

08:01.022 --> 08:03.732
Fuck. All of them.

08:05.861 --> 08:08.237
Get ready in five, four...

08:08.405 --> 08:11.240
...three, two, one.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.292
Shit!

08:22.419 --> 08:24.086
All right, all right.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.922
In five, four...

08:27.090 --> 08:28.799
...three...

08:34.431 --> 08:36.890
Ah, go, go!

09:36.326 --> 09:39.954
- It's getting thick here! I need backup!
- We got incoming.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.916
We'll hold them back for you, man!

09:44.084 --> 09:46.794
They're backing off.

09:49.256 --> 09:52.466
With the bonus from today's hit, and
the chips from this weekend's caper...

09:52.634 --> 09:55.052
...I should be able to take
about a year off.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.054
This is a bonus hit?

09:57.222 --> 09:59.974
Without a doubt. Twenty-five large
to whoever clip the big man.

10:00.141 --> 10:02.851
- Non-dairy creamer?
- Yeah.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.314
- What happened?
- Get off!

10:26.001 --> 10:27.251
Go, go!

11:08.209 --> 11:10.127
Are you ladies okay?

11:11.129 --> 11:13.213
I'm really sorry about the mess.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.550
- Time to get paid.
- Yes, sir.

11:22.432 --> 11:25.601
- Take a piece of this!
- That's what we talking about!

11:25.769 --> 11:27.353
Yeah, man!

11:28.563 --> 11:30.481
We fucked them up!

11:33.777 --> 11:35.444
You're so fine.

11:35.612 --> 11:39.114
I wanna pour milk on you and make
you part of my complete breakfast!

11:39.282 --> 11:41.617
- Baby, you got a number for me?
- 911!

11:41.785 --> 11:45.287
Come on, fellas, we gotta go!
Quit wasting your time.

11:45.455 --> 11:48.540
We better find Mel
before he gets my bonus.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.001
- Damn lesbians.
- Come on.

11:55.965 --> 11:58.050
Cisco, where the fuck you at?
I need backup!

11:58.218 --> 12:00.219
We'll hold them back for you, baby.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.925
- I'm out of here!
- Protect me, I'm paying you double!

12:40.093 --> 12:42.386
I can't spend it if I'm dead!

13:07.871 --> 13:08.954
Bastard.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.244
Shit! Cisco, Vince, Crunch,
we gotta get out of here now!

14:51.599 --> 14:54.977
Good work, good work, good work.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.479
Okay, Mel!

14:57.647 --> 15:01.525
Looks like you owe me $25,000
in cash advances.

15:01.693 --> 15:03.777
Your commission
should take care of that.

15:03.945 --> 15:07.531
But the good news is,
here's your bonus.

15:07.699 --> 15:09.366
Thank you, sir.

15:11.536 --> 15:14.663
- Mel got the bonus?
- What?

15:14.831 --> 15:18.375
Yo, yo, yo. Vince,
that guy was still alive, huh?

15:18.543 --> 15:20.043
Extremely alive.

15:20.211 --> 15:21.628
Shit!

15:23.506 --> 15:27.301
- I'm the one who clipped him.
- I don't think so. He was dead.

15:27.468 --> 15:30.971
Okay. Sure, whatever you say.

15:31.139 --> 15:33.390
I'm wrong and you're right.
I'm lying.

15:33.558 --> 15:36.602
I'm just trying to beat you
out of your hard-earned bonus, pal.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.645
My kill, my bonus.

15:38.813 --> 15:41.565
If you say you're the one
who clipped him...

15:41.733 --> 15:43.650
...who am I to say you didn't...

15:46.404 --> 15:48.363
...old friend?

16:02.295 --> 16:03.712
You're an honest man, Mel.

16:03.880 --> 16:07.007
Don't think I don't appreciate
that shit, baby.

16:07.175 --> 16:11.386
I'll tell you what. To show you
how much love I gots for you...

16:11.554 --> 16:14.306
...if anything were to...

16:14.474 --> 16:17.976
...you know, happen to me...

16:18.144 --> 16:21.938
...you could take my boat.

16:22.106 --> 16:26.068
- How'd that be? Is that love or what?
- I guess.

16:26.235 --> 16:28.403
You getting lonely, baby?

16:28.571 --> 16:30.947
Ah, yes, Daddy loves both of you.

16:32.742 --> 16:34.660
That motherfucker.
Shit!

16:34.827 --> 16:36.078
What?

16:36.245 --> 16:38.538
Mel, you sure
you don't wanna get in...

16:38.706 --> 16:40.624
...on this caper
we got planned for tomorrow?

16:40.792 --> 16:44.878
That's like moonlighting.
Paris will kill us for that shit.

16:45.046 --> 16:48.048
You're too honest
for your own good, baby.

17:03.940 --> 17:06.942
Wrong house again, asshole!

17:07.109 --> 17:08.484
Sorry.

17:50.945 --> 17:51.987
Hello?

17:52.155 --> 17:55.657
- Melvin Smiley, please.
- This is he.

17:55.825 --> 17:57.826
Mr. Smiley, Big Top Video.

17:57.994 --> 18:03.123
You¤ve had our copy of
King Kong Lives ¤or over t¤o ¤ee ks.

18:03.291 --> 18:07.461
Return it immediately
or we will have you killed!

18:07.628 --> 18:08.837
Yeah.

18:09.672 --> 18:11.673
Hon, how you doing?

18:11.841 --> 18:16.595
- Fine. Seen my ¤ing ¤ong Lives tape?
- No, haven't seen it.

18:19.682 --> 18:22.517
Mel, do you think my ass
is still perky?

18:22.685 --> 18:26.688
- As a matter of fact...
- Go ahead, just give it a squeeze.

18:26.856 --> 18:29.524
Let me know what you think.

18:29.692 --> 18:31.818
Is it still perky?

18:31.986 --> 18:35.280
- Is it firm, yet pliable?
- Like a teenager.

18:35.448 --> 18:39.701
- Is this turning you on?
- Like a light switch.

18:39.869 --> 18:43.205
- You know what I think we should do?
- What do you think we should do?

18:43.372 --> 18:46.374
Invite Mom and Dad down
for the holiday weekend.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.752
Actually, they're already coming down.
They're gonna be here tomorrow.

18:48.920 --> 18:51.296
I figured we'd all
have dinner together.

18:51.464 --> 18:54.382
I think this is gonna be
a great opportunity...

18:54.550 --> 18:56.802
...for you and my parents to bond.

18:56.969 --> 19:01.389
I also think that this will be the
right time to tell them we're engaged.

19:01.557 --> 19:05.268
- You haven't told them yet?
- I've been waiting for the right time.

19:05.436 --> 19:08.438
You've got to break things gently
to my parents.

19:08.606 --> 19:12.484
What do you mean? It was a year
before you told them I wasn't Jewish.

19:14.403 --> 19:17.072
Technically, they don't know
you're not Jewish.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.867
Honey, it's gonna be fine.

19:21.035 --> 19:24.246
I fixed things between us
just yesterday.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.665
They are gonna love you...

19:26.833 --> 19:30.168
...just as soon as they get over
the whole goyim factor.

19:30.336 --> 19:33.213
What makes you think
they're gonna love me?

19:33.381 --> 19:36.633
Remember when I told you Dad's
business was in trouble with the I. R.S.?

19:36.801 --> 19:38.510
Yeah, so?

19:38.678 --> 19:42.264
He was unable to get a loan
because of Mom's gambling...

19:42.431 --> 19:45.141
...and her plastic surgery
and everything, right?

19:45.309 --> 19:47.644
Are you still having problems
with your stomach?

19:47.812 --> 19:50.188
I told you about that spicy food.

19:50.356 --> 19:55.986
Anyway, I took the $50,000 we had in
our savings account and lent it to Dad.

19:56.153 --> 20:01.408
With as much money as we make, we'll
be fine until they get on their feet.

20:06.956 --> 20:09.207
I can't believe that this guy...

20:09.375 --> 20:11.960
...will give you 25 grand more.

20:12.128 --> 20:15.463
We've already got 50,000
out of this clown.

20:15.631 --> 20:17.841
He thinks I'm paying my bills off.

20:18.009 --> 20:20.510
What? You're not paying your bills?

20:20.678 --> 20:22.512
Hell no! Why should I?

20:22.680 --> 20:25.223
Let his fucking fiancé pay them off.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.856
Honey?

20:33.024 --> 20:35.025
- Are you awake?
- Yeah.

20:35.192 --> 20:38.486
Melvin, I'm really starting
to dislike you.

20:38.654 --> 20:41.156
I didn't find my money!

20:46.287 --> 20:48.413
You all right, babe?

20:50.458 --> 20:51.875
Yeah.

21:02.929 --> 21:05.347
Hello? Cisco, what's up, man?

21:05.514 --> 21:07.432
Mel, what¤s up, kid?

21:07.600 --> 21:12.145
That thing you got going
for tomorrow? Can I still get in?

21:19.070 --> 21:20.195
Yo, Gump...

21:20.363 --> 21:22.989
...I don't want no fuckups
on this kidnapping.

21:23.157 --> 21:28.078
Come on. I ain't like that no more!
You know I gots my shit...

21:28.245 --> 21:30.080
Together. You gots your shit together.

21:30.247 --> 21:32.749
You non-word-remembering
motherfucker.

21:33.834 --> 21:36.169
Cisco, I don't know about
no kidnapping shit.

21:36.337 --> 21:39.631
- A hundred large apiece.
- A hundred?

21:39.799 --> 21:42.425
Word up.
Here's the deal.

21:42.593 --> 21:46.221
There's this rich Japanese industrialist
named Jiro Nishi.

21:46.389 --> 21:49.307
- Nishi Electric?
- The one and only, baby.

21:49.475 --> 21:52.477
- Richest motherfucker on the seaboard.
- How do you know he's gonna pay?

21:54.730 --> 21:59.484
You're starting to sound like a bitch.
"How do you know he's gonna pay?"

22:00.611 --> 22:03.029
I gots this shit covered.

22:03.197 --> 22:06.366
That motherfucker Nishi's got millions
in cash laying around his crib.

22:06.534 --> 22:08.827
This motherfucker's loaded!

22:08.995 --> 22:11.454
It was a legitimate question.

22:17.878 --> 22:22.257
¤hat's it, Mr. ¤ishi.
You are officially broke.

22:22.425 --> 22:24.968
Everything. How could this
have happened?

22:25.136 --> 22:30.181
You knew the market was bearish.
It was risky making that movie.

22:30.349 --> 22:35.145
All my life, I wanted to make
a big Hollywood movie!

22:35.312 --> 22:40.275
I understand. ¤aste The ¤olden ¤pray
was a big movie, a huge movie.

22:40.443 --> 22:43.278
Actually, it was
the biggest movie ever made.

22:43.446 --> 22:46.948
Maybe you shouldn't have directed
and starred in it.

22:47.116 --> 22:49.868
I'm not the first person
to make big movie.

22:50.036 --> 22:55.373
I know. But gold leaf posters
for everybody? That was excessive.

22:55.750 --> 22:58.835
I need to pick up my daughter
at college.

22:59.003 --> 23:00.837
And?

23:01.005 --> 23:03.423
I can't afford to pay the driver.

23:03.591 --> 23:07.635
For crying out loud!
How much is it gonna cost?

23:10.514 --> 23:12.640
It's a stretch limo.

23:12.808 --> 23:14.642
Stretch this.

23:15.102 --> 23:18.438
Fuck ass no!
Hell no!

23:18.606 --> 23:21.733
No advances. I've got my chips
wrapped up in the Grande Pinoche.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.902
Ask Crunch. He's got spare loot.

23:24.070 --> 23:27.697
He don't spend it on shit
except maybe some smut.

23:28.991 --> 23:32.577
Can you hook me with 25 g's
until we do this?

23:32.745 --> 23:36.581
You need it for that
sell-out bitch again, don't you?

23:36.749 --> 23:39.000
- Who's a bitch?
- Get the fuck out of here.

23:41.337 --> 23:44.214
Get with the programme.

23:44.381 --> 23:48.009
Straight jacking saves you
that mad cream.

23:48.177 --> 23:50.637
Oh, well.

23:50.805 --> 23:53.348
Give me a call at the crib later.
I'll hook you up.

23:53.516 --> 23:56.351
Good looking out, man.

23:57.228 --> 24:00.855
I don't know why I'm encouraging you.
Fuck both them bitches.

24:01.023 --> 24:03.024
If they're running you through
that much shit, dump both their asses.

24:03.192 --> 24:06.361
- Where the hell is that limo?
- I can't, man.

24:06.529 --> 24:08.905
- What do you mean, you can't?
- I just can't. Okay?

24:09.073 --> 24:11.366
How the fuck come
you can't dump these two...

24:11.534 --> 24:14.410
...whack-ass, money-grubbing,
no-respect-giving bitches?

24:14.578 --> 24:16.204
- The truth?
- Yeah, I want the truth.

24:16.372 --> 24:18.581
You can't handle truth!

24:18.749 --> 24:20.583
Shut the fuck up!

24:20.751 --> 24:24.254
The truth is I can't stand the idea
of them not liking me anymore.

24:24.421 --> 24:27.757
The idea of those two women
not liking me is more than I can stand.

24:27.925 --> 24:31.177
I can't stand the idea
of anybody not liking me. Okay?

24:31.345 --> 24:34.305
There, I said it.
The truth. That's the truth.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.687
- Yo, Mel?
- What?

24:42.731 --> 24:47.402
The hundred or so people you
murdered in the past five years...

24:47.570 --> 24:51.447
...more than likely have relatives
who don't think too highly of you.

25:00.708 --> 25:02.417
- Hello?
- Hey, baby.

25:02.585 --> 25:07.088
- What's up, girl?
- You know why I called, don't you?

25:07.256 --> 25:09.924
I don't know.
Why did you call me?

25:10.092 --> 25:14.429
Because, ¤elvin,
l¤m getting sick of your ass!

25:14.597 --> 25:17.223
- Why do you always procrastinate?
- Stand up to her, Mel.

25:17.391 --> 25:22.270
Melvin, why are you
always lying to me...

25:22.438 --> 25:24.939
Car trouble?

25:27.026 --> 25:29.068
Put that damn phone to your ear.

25:29.236 --> 25:31.779
Mel, show her you're the man.

25:31.947 --> 25:35.033
What are you doing?
Playing with your friends?

25:35.201 --> 25:36.868
You are pathetic.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.244
Bye!

25:38.412 --> 25:41.247
Yeah, of course,
you know I love you.

25:41.415 --> 25:43.958
All right. We'll hook up later.
Anything you want, sweetie.

25:51.592 --> 25:53.509
Here you go.

25:54.845 --> 25:59.140
- This is the girl?
- No, it's your mammy.

26:07.816 --> 26:09.692
Maria's having a party tonight.

26:09.860 --> 26:11.653
Bye, guys.

26:12.696 --> 26:15.198
Are you gonna go?
I'll meet you there. See you tonight.

26:15.366 --> 26:17.283
Bye.

26:18.953 --> 26:21.371
Lance! You're so nasty.

26:21.538 --> 26:26.376
A much deserved and hard-won
reputation. Am I still riding with you?

26:26.543 --> 26:30.672
- Don't push my hand away.
- Stop!

26:30.839 --> 26:35.009
What's your problem?
You're an ice queen today.

26:36.011 --> 26:38.388
- Stop!
- Good afternoon, Miss Nishi.

26:38.555 --> 26:41.224
Hi. Who are you?
Where's Aaron?

26:41.392 --> 26:45.228
He couldn't make it today. He's sick.
Is this yours?

26:45.396 --> 26:46.729
Yeah.

26:55.489 --> 26:57.156
See ya.

27:03.872 --> 27:08.126
Sir, I think it would better if you
could get a ride from somebody else.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.336
Bro, don't worry about me.

27:10.504 --> 27:13.089
Drive the car.
That's what you're paid to do.

27:13.257 --> 27:15.383
And don't forget my suitcase.

27:18.095 --> 27:22.223
Careful with that case, bro!
There's fragile crystal in there.

27:22.391 --> 27:25.476
You break it,
you'll be back driving cabs.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.770
Sorry about that, sir.

27:41.827 --> 27:43.411
- Bro?
- Yes, sir?

27:43.579 --> 27:46.497
- A little privacy!
- Yes, sir. Sorry about that.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.082
Domestics!

27:52.880 --> 27:54.422
Lance!

27:54.590 --> 27:57.592
Lance, no. No. Come on.

27:57.760 --> 28:00.178
Yeah, right!
No means yes.

28:00.346 --> 28:02.764
- Come on, baby, you know you want it.
- Stop!

28:03.849 --> 28:05.266
Get off me!

28:06.268 --> 28:09.312
Fucky-sucky. Me love you long time!

28:09.480 --> 28:11.314
Get off me!

28:11.482 --> 28:13.066
Stop it!

28:21.116 --> 28:23.451
What's up with that, bro?

28:24.453 --> 28:27.246
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

28:33.087 --> 28:37.423
He's gonna take his hand off your
mouth. Don't scream or he'll shoot you.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.967
I'll blow your...

28:40.135 --> 28:41.719
...motherfucking...

28:41.887 --> 28:44.263
I think she gets the point.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.809
Professor.

28:49.728 --> 28:53.648
I'm really sorry about your boyfriend.
He was being kind of rude.

28:53.816 --> 28:55.691
Do you mind?

28:56.527 --> 28:58.903
This is a kidnapping, right?

28:59.071 --> 29:01.322
- Right.
- So what's up with you guys?

29:01.490 --> 29:03.825
You supposed to be the Spice Boys?

29:11.333 --> 29:14.710
You need to chill
with that being witty shit.

29:14.878 --> 29:17.004
Professor, put the cuffs on her.

29:19.425 --> 29:21.634
Skipper, Professor, take care
of that mess in the backseat.

29:21.802 --> 29:23.678
You must be the millionaire.

29:23.846 --> 29:25.680
Pretty soon.

29:33.021 --> 29:34.689
- Read this.
- "Father..."

29:38.485 --> 29:40.653
"Father, I have been abduct.
I am fine."

29:40.821 --> 29:42.363
Abducted.

29:43.031 --> 29:45.700
- It says "abduct."
- Just say abducted.

29:47.578 --> 29:52.832
"I have been abducted. I am fine now,
but I may not be for loring.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.210
If you do not pay the sun
of one million doolers..."

29:56.378 --> 30:01.048
- Loring? Sun of one million doolers?
- That's what it says.

30:01.216 --> 30:04.719
That's "long" and the "sum"
of one million "dollars."

30:04.887 --> 30:06.804
- You know what it means.
- You told me to read this.

30:06.972 --> 30:09.223
- That's what I'm doing.
- Say what it means.

30:10.225 --> 30:14.437
Be careful with that one.
That's Lance's crystal. It's fragile.

30:22.905 --> 30:26.699
"I may not be for long. If you do not
pay the sum of one million dollars...

30:26.867 --> 30:30.328
...you will never see me alive again
as these men mean businesses."

30:30.496 --> 30:32.163
Who wrote this?

30:33.373 --> 30:35.291
- Crunch!
- What?

30:36.960 --> 30:39.253
I think he's pissed about the note.

30:39.421 --> 30:41.047
It says "businesses."

30:41.215 --> 30:44.550
You told me to read the note.
You never said to improv it.

30:44.718 --> 30:49.388
Improv! Are you Meryl-fucking-Streep?
Okay, improv the note.

30:49.556 --> 30:54.435
These sexually frustrated
degenerate losers mean business.

30:54.603 --> 30:57.605
Don't, don't improv.
Don't improv the note.

30:57.773 --> 31:00.650
Gump, give me a fucking pen!

31:12.246 --> 31:13.412
Read.

31:13.580 --> 31:16.791
"Dad, been kidnapped.
Send one million or I'm dead."

31:16.959 --> 31:18.459
Perfect.

31:23.674 --> 31:26.801
Yo, Mel, my player,
here go the scenario.

31:26.969 --> 31:30.555
Since Chantel is cool, take homegirl
and store her at your place.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.765
- Why my place?
- 'Cause.

31:32.933 --> 31:35.101
- 'Cause why?
- 'Cause!

31:35.269 --> 31:38.187
'Cause that's the best plan right now.
Just do what I say.

31:50.617 --> 31:53.494
- What about the limo?
- You want me to drive that, too?

31:53.662 --> 31:56.080
I got the limo, the girl,
all kind of shit.

31:56.248 --> 31:58.082
What's your name, kid?

31:58.250 --> 32:02.003
Shut up. Don't fuck this up.
I got to get home and jerk off.

32:02.170 --> 32:05.715
- Can you...
- Drive! Yes, I can fucking drive.

32:14.349 --> 32:16.892
- Hi, honey!
- Hiya, Mom!

32:18.979 --> 32:20.980
Look at you!

32:21.148 --> 32:23.524
Hiya, Dad. How are ya?

32:23.692 --> 32:25.568
How was your train ride?

32:25.736 --> 32:29.238
The train ride was fine. It's the
cab ride over I could've lived without.

32:29.406 --> 32:32.491
This Turkish idiot who barely spoke
one word of English...

32:32.659 --> 32:35.036
...drops us off at that schmuck
next door's house.

32:35.203 --> 32:37.955
And the bastard, could you believe this,
he starts cursing at us!

32:38.123 --> 32:40.333
- I need a drink.
- No!

32:43.879 --> 32:46.088
- Ma?
- Yeah?

32:46.256 --> 32:50.551
I'm not criticizing you
or anything like that, okay?

32:50.719 --> 32:52.887
It's just that I think...

32:53.055 --> 32:56.265
...maybe you should dress your age.

32:57.559 --> 33:01.937
I mean, look at Dad. He's dressed
like a villain from "Miami Vice."

33:02.105 --> 33:06.108
Dress my age? I'll have you know
Morton and I dress the way we feel.

33:06.276 --> 33:08.110
Look at your father.

33:08.278 --> 33:10.738
He's a regular sex machine.

33:11.657 --> 33:13.574
Yeah, a regular Brad Pitt.

33:13.742 --> 33:17.411
So, where is our benefactor?

33:21.083 --> 33:22.583
Are you okay?

33:23.669 --> 33:25.836
All right. I'll be right back.

33:29.424 --> 33:33.511
I went to the bank today,
and do you know what I found?

33:33.679 --> 33:36.430
Or should I say, do you know
what I didn't find?

33:36.598 --> 33:40.476
- I wasn't able to...
- I am really starting to dislike you.

33:42.813 --> 33:46.440
- I didn't find my money!
- It's at Crunch's.

33:46.608 --> 33:49.443
I'll call and get it tonight.

33:49.611 --> 33:51.153
Now!

33:57.202 --> 34:00.538
- Yo, money! You ready to...
- Do it. Yeah.

34:00.706 --> 34:02.623
That's my word!

34:03.709 --> 34:05.668
Make sure we get this right.

34:05.836 --> 34:08.254
Crunch fucked me up
with that whack-ass note.

34:08.422 --> 34:11.172
All right.
My phone is plugged into here.

34:11.341 --> 34:14.885
This motherfucking Tracebuster
will keep that motherfucker from...

34:15.053 --> 34:17.679
- Trace?
- Tracing our shit. Know what I say?

34:17.848 --> 34:22.143
This Tracebuster keeps a buster
from tracing your call.

34:22.310 --> 34:25.603
- It can also...
- Trace?

34:25.772 --> 34:28.065
Trace the motherfucker
that's tracing your shit!

34:28.233 --> 34:30.943
What if they got a Tracebuster, too?

34:31.110 --> 34:34.572
That's why I've got
this Tracebuster Buster.

34:34.739 --> 34:37.324
When a motherfucker try to bust
your trace with a Tracebuster...

34:37.492 --> 34:42.079
...this will bust the motherfucking
Tracebuster that's busting your...

34:43.373 --> 34:46.333
- Trace!
- That's my word, player!

34:46.501 --> 34:51.255
- Use my cell phone.
- Patch that into here, all right?

34:51.422 --> 34:54.717
- Plug and play, motherfucker!
- Yo!

35:29.085 --> 35:30.461
Hello.

35:30.629 --> 35:34.965
Mr. Nishi, you don't know me, but I
have something you may want to hear.

35:36.051 --> 35:38.552
It says "businesses."
That's what it...

35:38.720 --> 35:40.805
Hold on. That's not it.

35:43.225 --> 35:46.268
These sexually frustrated...

35:46.436 --> 35:49.897
Hold on. Just, you know, relax.

35:52.901 --> 35:56.654
- Listen to this.
- Tooth polish, hemorrhoid cream...

35:59.574 --> 36:02.076
Hello? Hello?

36:03.203 --> 36:07.122
That motherfucker had the nerve
to hop smart on my ass!

36:24.724 --> 36:26.141
What?

36:27.602 --> 36:31.981
Dad, I've been kidnapped.
Send one million or I'm dead.

36:32.148 --> 36:33.482
Who is this?

36:33.650 --> 36:35.985
Don't worry about who this is!
We have your daughter.

36:36.152 --> 36:37.987
We want $1 million or she dies.

36:38.154 --> 36:40.739
- Plain and simple.
- Is she okay?

36:40.907 --> 36:43.784
She's fine, but if we don't get
that money she won't be.

36:43.952 --> 36:48.289
I don't have money.
I go bankrupt.

36:48.456 --> 36:53.711
Bullshit! Don't fuck with us or we'll
send her back in little fucking pieces!

36:54.921 --> 36:57.673
Get us the million by noon tomorrow
or she's a slab of meat!

36:57.841 --> 37:01.302
- Understand me?
- I understand.

37:01.469 --> 37:04.471
I'll call you at 10:00 a. M. And tell you
where the drop goes down. No cops.

37:04.639 --> 37:08.517
Or I start cutting.
I smell a cop, I'll cut off her hand!

37:08.685 --> 37:11.645
Don't try to trace this call.
It won't do you no good.

37:12.856 --> 37:15.149
That's how you do shit!

37:15.317 --> 37:18.986
I gots this shit well in control!
We're about to get paid.

37:19.154 --> 37:23.115
I not call police.
Fuck all the police!

37:23.283 --> 37:25.117
Was I a bad motherfucker?

37:25.285 --> 37:27.786
- You was a bad...
- Motherfucker!

37:27.954 --> 37:29.747
- Bad!
- Bad motherfucker!

37:29.915 --> 37:32.458
Mean! Nasty!

37:33.668 --> 37:35.836
I trace you, buster!

37:41.384 --> 37:44.386
Up you go. Go, go.

37:47.390 --> 37:49.558
Hello.

38:09.913 --> 38:11.872
That's it, baby.

38:12.040 --> 38:15.751
10:00 a. M. Tomorrow we set up
the drop and by noon we get paid.

38:15.919 --> 38:17.252
Yo, my nigger!

38:17.420 --> 38:20.464
We gonna get paid!

38:21.800 --> 38:23.509
In the house!

38:23.677 --> 38:26.720
Get your ass to my office
in 20 minutes.

38:29.474 --> 38:31.642
Fuck! Motherfucker!

38:31.810 --> 38:35.020
Paris called me for some emergency
shit. Don't do jack till I get back.

38:35.188 --> 38:37.481
Yo, yo, if you want me to,
I could set up the...

38:37.649 --> 38:40.567
Drop it, motherfucker!
Don't do shit till I get back!

38:48.159 --> 38:51.787
I'm really sorry.
I mean, it's nice to finally meet you.

38:51.955 --> 38:55.457
You seem like a nice enough
German-Irish fella.

38:55.625 --> 38:59.211
And I hope you won't take any offence
when I say...

38:59.379 --> 39:01.588
...what are you both,
out of your minds?

39:01.756 --> 39:04.133
- Ma, we know what we're doing.
- Oh, yeah?

39:04.300 --> 39:07.428
You're gonna kill your father.
That's what you're doing.

39:07.595 --> 39:10.806
Marriage? You two?
A Catholic and a Jew? God forbid.

39:12.475 --> 39:15.185
You're gonna put your father
in an early grave!

39:15.353 --> 39:19.189
- What is this doing to your parents?
- Actually they're both dead.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.191
You see? Do you see?

39:21.359 --> 39:24.194
Ma, they were dead before we met.

39:24.362 --> 39:29.783
I know. This isn't about Daddy
or Mel's parents. It's about you.

39:29.951 --> 39:32.119
You're prejudiced.

39:32.287 --> 39:34.747
- Prejudiced? I'm prejudiced?
- Yeah.

39:34.914 --> 39:38.167
I'll have you know there is not one
prejudiced bone in my body.

39:38.334 --> 39:42.379
Not prejudiced? If I wanna
marry goyim, I'll marry goyim!

39:42.547 --> 39:45.799
- Over my dead body you will!
- If I want, I'll marry a black man.

39:45.967 --> 39:48.469
- Shut your mouth!
- A six-foot-nine...

39:52.474 --> 39:54.933
Excuse me, sir.
I just wanted to apologise.

39:55.101 --> 39:57.186
I didn't mean to cause
such a schlimazel.

39:57.353 --> 39:59.772
I'll take them to temple tomorrow.

39:59.939 --> 40:02.816
Do you think that might work?

40:04.277 --> 40:06.403
- Mr. Shulman?
- Mort.

40:06.571 --> 40:10.449
Sorry. Mort. Sir, I know how
your wife feels about me and Pam.

40:10.617 --> 40:14.286
I just wanted you to know that I would
never marry her without your blessing.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.207
Yes, sir?

40:18.374 --> 40:21.001
Could you get me a shot of that rum
I saw in there?

40:21.169 --> 40:22.753
Yeah, sure.

40:49.364 --> 40:52.282
- Never give Daddy something to drink.
- Why? What's the matter?

40:52.450 --> 40:54.910
- It's horrible.
- It's not so bad.

40:55.078 --> 40:59.039
It's not so bad?
He's a meshuggenah, that's what he is.

41:26.401 --> 41:30.070
- Yo, boss, what's going on?
- Sit down and shut up.

41:38.872 --> 41:41.290
Even for those who live
outside the law...

41:43.001 --> 41:47.921
...it is commonly understood there are
certain rules which must be observed.

41:48.089 --> 41:51.133
Otherwise what you have is anarchy.

41:52.093 --> 41:54.094
I hear you, boss.

41:56.014 --> 42:00.225
We run a serious business here.
The business of making money.

42:00.393 --> 42:04.479
This business is based on trust
and loyalty and honour.

42:04.647 --> 42:07.941
In the house of Paris,
that's all we've got.

42:08.109 --> 42:10.444
That's it, baby.
It's all about love.

42:16.826 --> 42:19.745
When the rules are broken
in the house of Paris...

42:19.913 --> 42:21.371
...the machine breaks down.

42:22.624 --> 42:24.958
Discipline must be enforced.

42:25.126 --> 42:28.462
Order must be restored.

42:28.630 --> 42:31.798
In my house,
there has been a transgression.

42:32.759 --> 42:37.262
An unauthorised kidnapping
in my house.

42:38.806 --> 42:41.600
- Who could be that stupid?
- It gets worse.

42:41.768 --> 42:44.519
In this particular case...

42:44.687 --> 42:46.563
...the transgression is personal.

42:46.731 --> 42:48.774
In this case...

42:48.942 --> 42:53.028
...the kidnappee happens to be
my goddaughter.

42:53.196 --> 42:55.656
- Fuck no!
- Some rock.

42:55.823 --> 42:57.407
Some dolt.

42:57.575 --> 43:01.286
Some less than senseless thing
has decided to come...

43:01.454 --> 43:04.206
...to my house
and kidnap my goddaughter.

43:04.374 --> 43:06.291
And I am looking...

43:06.459 --> 43:09.503
...I am searching for a motherfucker...

43:09.671 --> 43:12.547
...stupid enough to fuck with me.

43:15.176 --> 43:17.678
Yo, boss, what's this got
to do with me?

43:17.845 --> 43:21.431
I want to know what you would do
to that son of a jackal.

43:22.725 --> 43:24.184
Me?

43:26.187 --> 43:28.605
I would, you know, I would...

43:28.773 --> 43:32.442
What would you do to someone...

43:32.610 --> 43:37.197
...who decided to fuck with you
in your own house?

43:38.533 --> 43:40.534
I'd bust some caps!

43:40.702 --> 43:44.496
Bust some caps!
Give this man a gold star.

43:45.957 --> 43:49.084
It is you who...

43:51.379 --> 43:52.754
Give me that!

43:55.216 --> 44:00.554
It is you that I'm putting in charge
of this whole operation.

44:00.722 --> 44:04.224
It is you who must go forth...

44:04.392 --> 44:09.021
...and bring these motherfuckers
to me.

44:19.240 --> 44:21.658
Let's just take the money...

44:21.826 --> 44:24.661
...and go to L.A. Where people
like us belong.

44:25.830 --> 44:27.247
I love this movie.

44:52.774 --> 44:55.525
Get that, Mel, will you?
I'm not dressed.

44:56.402 --> 44:58.445
What are you doing here?

44:58.613 --> 45:01.698
I just came to drop your shit off
before I said good-bye.

45:01.866 --> 45:04.493
Good-bye, you punk-ass bitch.
I'm leaving this town.

45:04.660 --> 45:07.871
What are you doing? Chantel?

45:08.039 --> 45:09.623
Shit!

45:10.958 --> 45:14.294
I'm getting a glass of prune juice.

45:14.462 --> 45:16.671
Hurry up.
We've got a long way to go.

45:16.839 --> 45:19.299
Don't worry. I know a shortcut.

45:47.578 --> 45:49.830
No, sweetie.
You don't want to do that.

45:49.997 --> 45:52.499
- What's in there? It's heavy.
- It's deer meat, actually.

45:52.667 --> 45:55.836
- What?
- Cisco went hunting and got a deer.

45:56.003 --> 45:58.672
He gave the meat to me
because he's a vegetarian.

45:58.840 --> 46:00.674
- There's a dead deer in there?
- Yeah.

46:00.842 --> 46:03.468
That's gross. Take it out
to the garbage, please.

46:03.636 --> 46:06.346
Sorry about that.

46:21.904 --> 46:23.864
Ma, pour me some coffee.

46:25.366 --> 46:27.909
- You don't want to go in there.
- I need to get something.

46:28.077 --> 46:30.954
It smells really bad. Stinky poo-poo.

46:31.122 --> 46:33.290
That's disgusting.

46:35.585 --> 46:38.295
Morton, look at that dog.

46:42.550 --> 46:45.385
Hey, get away!

46:45.553 --> 46:48.054
Go away, you giant rat!

46:48.222 --> 46:51.099
There's something so peculiar
about that boy.

46:53.728 --> 46:55.312
Let go!

47:02.862 --> 47:04.779
- Hello? Hold on.
- Big Top ¤ideo.

47:16.417 --> 47:18.043
Now I'm hearing things.

47:24.759 --> 47:26.885
- I am not going to temple.
- Hello?

47:27.053 --> 47:28.261
Hello!

47:28.429 --> 47:30.931
Understandable you're avoiding us.

47:31.098 --> 47:33.225
- You know why we're calling.
- Sorry. I apologise.

47:33.392 --> 47:35.769
- She has become godless.
- What's the matter, little girl?

47:35.937 --> 47:39.814
Why are you crying? Because
I wanna rent ¤ing ¤ong Lives.

47:39.982 --> 47:42.442
- Who are you talking to?
- I'm sorry.

47:42.610 --> 47:46.404
But you can't rent that.
Melvin Smiley has that out right now.

47:46.572 --> 47:50.492
- And he's too busy to bring it back.
- I promise I'll bring it back.

47:54.121 --> 47:56.790
Aren't you going to temple?

47:56.958 --> 48:00.126
- What do you mean, no?
- You're going to ruin my surprise.

48:00.294 --> 48:03.171
I don't like surprises.
What surprise?

48:03.339 --> 48:06.967
I was planning on cooking a nice
kosher meal for you and your folks.

48:08.928 --> 48:12.264
- This I gotta see.
- Excuse me one second.

48:12.431 --> 48:14.391
Let go of that!

48:16.269 --> 48:17.686
Let go!

48:19.438 --> 48:20.981
Get out of here.

48:21.148 --> 48:24.651
You are a pathetic little man.

48:32.910 --> 48:34.327
Shit!

48:52.471 --> 48:53.847
You're back.

48:54.015 --> 48:57.642
Daddy had to make a pit stop,
and I forgot my purse.

48:57.810 --> 48:59.769
You don't have to make a pit stop,
Mrs. Shulman?

48:59.937 --> 49:02.022
No, I'm fine.
I'm fine right here.

49:02.189 --> 49:04.858
- It's a long drive.
- I'm fine.

49:05.026 --> 49:07.736
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

49:07.903 --> 49:11.865
I forgot a thing in the trunk there.

49:12.033 --> 49:15.076
Look, if you've got a thing
in the trunk, you'd better get it out.

49:15.244 --> 49:16.661
I will.

49:18.205 --> 49:21.625
- What's that?
- It's his thing. Get in. We're late.

49:21.792 --> 49:24.377
If there's a dead deer in there,
get it out of there.

49:24.545 --> 49:26.421
- Let's go!
- I swear.

49:31.719 --> 49:34.012
I can do this.

49:36.390 --> 49:38.350
Cisco, where the fuck are you?

49:49.236 --> 49:52.072
Don't call. Don't you call.

49:52.239 --> 49:55.075
Don't you fucking call,
you stupid fuck.

49:55.242 --> 49:58.119
They got Tracebuster Buster.

49:58.287 --> 50:02.666
I got Tracebuster Buster Buster
for their ass.

50:06.212 --> 50:08.254
All right, think, think.
Crunch!

50:09.256 --> 50:12.967
Be cool, playboy.
I got you covered.

50:13.135 --> 50:14.969
I tell you what.

50:15.137 --> 50:18.640
I'll pick the chick up and keep her
here in my crib. You feel better?

50:18.808 --> 50:21.434
- Much. What time?
- I've gotta stop by the office.

50:21.602 --> 50:25.647
- Give me an hour and a half. Cool?
- Yeah, cool. Thanks, bro.

50:32.113 --> 50:35.949
You ready again? You ready again?
Come on.

50:41.622 --> 50:43.540
Are you okay?

50:45.292 --> 50:48.628
I'm gonna take your gag off,
but you gotta promise not to scream.

50:54.468 --> 50:57.470
I don't suppose you could take
these cuffs off, too?

50:57.638 --> 51:00.515
- Sorry.
- I didn't think so.

51:00.683 --> 51:02.892
- I have to pee.
- Yeah.

51:07.148 --> 51:08.773
I need help.

51:08.941 --> 51:10.316
Oh, sorry.

51:11.485 --> 51:16.781
No, I need help with my underwear,
unless you wanna take my cuffs off.

51:16.949 --> 51:18.324
Sorry.

51:40.848 --> 51:42.265
I'm done.

51:48.981 --> 51:52.192
- You don't seem like a kidnapper.
- I'm usually not.

51:52.359 --> 51:55.403
- Aren't you gonna flush?
- Yeah.

51:55.571 --> 51:57.697
Technically you could call me
a hit man.

51:58.449 --> 52:01.451
Really? A hit man?
Does that pay well?

52:01.619 --> 52:04.204
Of course.
I make a killing.

52:05.456 --> 52:08.041
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

52:08.209 --> 52:10.168
I'm hungry. You must be starved.

52:10.336 --> 52:13.838
- I'm so hungry, I could eat a...
- Horse?

52:14.006 --> 52:15.882
I could never eat a horse.

52:16.050 --> 52:19.010
Let me know what you want. I can go
in the kitchen and cook it for us.

52:19.178 --> 52:21.095
Will you put a hit on it for me?

52:21.263 --> 52:23.056
Yeah.

52:23.224 --> 52:25.266
How about a pterodactyl?

52:25.434 --> 52:27.894
You're in luck.
I just whacked...

52:28.062 --> 52:30.396
...a rare, extra cheese and pepperoni
pterodactyl.

52:30.564 --> 52:32.607
- Cold or nuked?
- Nuke it.

52:33.901 --> 52:37.612
That girl from the other house,
she your girlfriend?

52:37.780 --> 52:41.115
Yeah, I guess so, kind of,
but I'm engaged to Pam.

52:41.283 --> 52:44.702
Chantel is kind of your girlfriend, but
you're engaged to another girl, Pam?

52:44.870 --> 52:48.039
Sounds complicated.
Tell me more.

52:48.207 --> 52:53.086
Cisco, I can do this.
I ain't no fuckup. I can do this.

52:53.254 --> 52:55.922
I'm gonna prove it. I'm gonna prove
my ass to all you motherfuckers...

52:56.090 --> 52:58.007
...that I can handle my...

53:00.928 --> 53:02.762
...business.

53:02.930 --> 53:06.224
Yeah. I can handle my business!

53:51.478 --> 53:53.354
Hello?

53:53.522 --> 53:55.940
Mr. Nishi, noon today,
¤1 million cash.

53:56.108 --> 53:59.986
In a plastic garbage bag.
Place it in the green garbage can...

54:00.154 --> 54:02.447
...near the Abbey Shelter
on McBryde Trail...

54:02.615 --> 54:04.365
...right off of Old School Road.

54:04.533 --> 54:06.159
Do you understand?

54:08.954 --> 54:12.874
I don't understand "McBlyde."

54:13.042 --> 54:14.792
What?

54:14.960 --> 54:17.921
No, no. Hang up.

54:18.088 --> 54:19.964
What is "McBlyde"?

54:20.132 --> 54:22.425
McBryde Trail...

54:22.593 --> 54:25.637
...is a goddamn...

54:26.597 --> 54:31.309
- What is "McBlyde"?
- It's a motherfucking...

54:32.353 --> 54:36.064
A goddamn thing.

54:48.494 --> 54:49.869
I understand.

54:50.037 --> 54:52.372
McBryde Trail.

54:53.707 --> 54:56.751
I will drop money there.

54:56.919 --> 54:58.336
Good.

55:04.134 --> 55:06.219
Get him. Get him!

55:08.180 --> 55:10.807
Let's go, let's go!
Bust a move!

55:20.192 --> 55:23.569
It's your life.
You have to take some responsibility.

55:24.697 --> 55:27.824
It seems like no matter what I do,
it's never really good enough.

55:28.909 --> 55:31.953
You know?
It's starting to make me miserable.

55:32.121 --> 55:34.330
You can't blame Chantel and Pam
for taking advantage of you.

55:34.498 --> 55:36.332
You make it too easy for them.

55:36.500 --> 55:40.586
I'm not blaming them,
at least I'm not trying to.

55:42.756 --> 55:45.800
At the end of the day,
all I want them to do is be happy.

55:46.552 --> 55:48.428
I don't know.

55:48.595 --> 55:51.848
I just can't stand the idea
of them not liking me anymore.

55:53.976 --> 55:57.562
To be perfectly honest, I can't stand
the idea of anybody not liking me.

55:58.480 --> 56:00.982
That sounds pretty dysfunctional.

56:01.150 --> 56:04.444
Why do you say that?
What do you mean?

56:04.611 --> 56:08.948
I mean, you might suffer from
a borderline personality disorder.

56:09.116 --> 56:11.826
- And you have co-dependency issues.
- What?

56:12.995 --> 56:15.621
You're whipped.

56:15.789 --> 56:19.000
You seem nice. You're not like
the others. Do what's right for you.

56:21.837 --> 56:24.297
You're really smart.
You know that?

56:40.355 --> 56:42.690
What the fuck is that?

56:54.286 --> 56:57.789
All right, you filthy
kidnapping scum person, you!

56:57.956 --> 57:00.166
- Where's the girl?
- She's at...

57:01.543 --> 57:03.461
Don't get cute with us, scumbag.

57:03.629 --> 57:05.546
I've been sent here by my boss,
Paris...

57:05.714 --> 57:08.341
...whose goddaughter you all happen
to be kidnapping...

57:08.509 --> 57:09.967
...to find her.

57:10.135 --> 57:15.181
If you wanna stay breathing,
you better tell me, Melvin...

57:15.349 --> 57:18.309
...where the fuck she
is and who the fuck, Melvin...

57:18.477 --> 57:20.561
...is the insidious mastermind
behind this plot.

57:20.729 --> 57:22.146
Melvin.

57:23.649 --> 57:25.066
Melvin?

57:26.110 --> 57:29.862
Melvin? Melvin Smiley?

57:31.156 --> 57:34.200
Melvin Smiley is the mastermind
behind this kidnapping?

57:36.036 --> 57:37.453
Oh, my God!

57:39.832 --> 57:41.749
What a world.

57:41.917 --> 57:44.210
I mean, the humanity.

57:44.378 --> 57:45.753
The betrayal.

57:46.713 --> 57:49.632
He was like a brother to me, man.

57:51.802 --> 57:53.427
Oh, well.

58:09.403 --> 58:11.362
Somebody's gotta die.

58:12.906 --> 58:15.116
Look at it as a privilege, you know?

58:15.284 --> 58:19.203
You're always dying to do something
for me. Now's your chance.

58:37.890 --> 58:40.183
All right, no more Mr. Nice Guy.

58:40.350 --> 58:42.643
Now we're gonna find Melvin Smiley...

58:42.811 --> 58:44.937
...and we're gonna kill him.

58:45.856 --> 58:48.065
Melvin. Son of a bitch.

58:48.233 --> 58:51.360
I knew the boy had financial problems,
but I didn't dream he'd go this far.

58:51.528 --> 58:54.447
Find the girl first,
then deal him.

58:56.241 --> 58:58.242
Pack up.
We are going for a ride.

58:58.410 --> 59:02.830
Who knows what unspeakable things
they do to my little girl?

59:02.998 --> 59:06.292
It says you're supposed to soak
the matzo for five minutes.

59:06.460 --> 59:08.836
- Okay.
- Is this traditional Jewish cooking?

59:09.004 --> 59:11.339
I hope so. It's the only
Jewish cookbook in the house.

59:13.842 --> 59:16.469
You need margarine
to sauté the mushrooms.

59:18.180 --> 59:19.889
Shit! Is that kosher?

59:20.057 --> 59:23.935
Like I would know. You need to stir it
so it doesn't stick.

59:25.187 --> 59:27.980
I could help you better
if I didn't have these cuffs on.

59:28.148 --> 59:29.523
All right.

59:40.702 --> 59:42.745
You're pretty good at this.

59:43.705 --> 59:45.831
You ever cook for your dad?

59:45.999 --> 59:48.167
My father doesn't even know I'm alive.

59:48.335 --> 59:50.878
Not until I have to impress
some of his associates.

59:52.005 --> 59:54.006
- Do you have brown sugar?
- Yeah.

59:58.178 --> 01:00:01.597
Do you know what it's like living
your life to please other people?

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:03.891
I guess you do, huh?

01:00:05.018 --> 01:00:09.855
It's a drag. Sometimes I wish I could
just get away. Know what I mean?

01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:13.359
I do, as a matter of fact.
I've always dreamt of getting away.

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:20.491
Come here. What are you doing?
You're missing the point.

01:00:20.659 --> 01:00:23.703
The whole joy of cooking. You have to
use your hands, get in and get messy.

01:00:24.496 --> 01:00:26.414
Get in there.

01:00:27.833 --> 01:00:29.875
Kind of like it.

01:00:37.301 --> 01:00:40.553
Now we have to glaze
our LM-4 white leghorn.

01:00:40.721 --> 01:00:43.723
- Our LM what?
- Common broiler chicken.

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:46.559
I'm studying them
in advanced biotechnology.

01:01:41.573 --> 01:01:43.074
Damn!

01:01:43.241 --> 01:01:46.786
I'm sorry.
I'll clean it up for you, okay?

01:02:14.147 --> 01:02:17.566
Did you know the white leghorn
was bred with the Ross sire line...

01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:20.736
...to create the hybrid
known as the Roslin QTL Cross?

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:23.364
Of course.
Doesn't everybody?

01:02:23.532 --> 01:02:25.699
Gave rise to over
33 different phenotypes...

01:02:25.867 --> 01:02:28.828
...all distinct for reaching their
sexual maturity within two months.

01:02:28.995 --> 01:02:30.663
Then we eat them.

01:02:30.831 --> 01:02:32.832
Yep.

01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:37.336
You know, it's kind of sad.
In order to feed us...

01:02:37.504 --> 01:02:40.631
...something so young and
in the prime of its life...

01:02:42.634 --> 01:02:44.218
...has to die.

01:02:46.972 --> 01:02:49.890
- Help! Help!
- Keiko!

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:59.066
I'm sorry.

01:03:05.282 --> 01:03:06.699
Oh, shit!

01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:14.540
Fuck!

01:03:36.563 --> 01:03:40.024
- Here you go, Ma.
- You feel better, Bunza Bun?

01:03:40.192 --> 01:03:43.986
Getting your hair done always helps
to mend a broken heart.

01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:46.572
You're doing the right thing, baby.

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:49.366
We have to preserve our heritage.

01:03:49.534 --> 01:03:51.410
You'll tell him after eating.

01:03:51.578 --> 01:03:54.872
Better he should have a broken heart
on a full stomach.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:57.249
Think he's gonna take
the money back?

01:04:11.723 --> 01:04:14.767
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. How was your outing?

01:04:14.935 --> 01:04:17.269
Smells good. Something's cooking.

01:04:17.437 --> 01:04:19.855
We're ready to eat when you are.

01:04:22.108 --> 01:04:24.109
- Hello?
- This is Crunch.

01:04:24.277 --> 01:04:26.362
What's up?
Hold on one second.

01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:28.489
- Can you excuse me one second?
- Sure.

01:04:28.657 --> 01:04:30.491
- Let's go.
- Hello?

01:04:30.659 --> 01:04:32.743
Yo, Crunch.
What the fuck is going on?

01:04:33.495 --> 01:04:34.954
Left.

01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:38.332
Right here.

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.501
This is the place.

01:04:40.669 --> 01:04:45.464
I'm getting the fuck out of the country,
and you need to do the same. Now!

01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:48.884
I went by the office today.

01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:51.136
Paris is planning a big hit.

01:04:52.222 --> 01:04:55.724
Yo, nigger! I said it should have
some lanolin in it.

01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:59.478
Not some goddamn aloe vera bullshit.
Motherfucker!

01:04:59.646 --> 01:05:01.647
Get it straight.

01:05:02.649 --> 01:05:04.358
Seems like some motherfuckers
done gone...

01:05:04.526 --> 01:05:07.027
...and kidnapped Paris' goddaughter.

01:05:07.195 --> 01:05:11.448
Some Japanese bitch. Our
Japanese bitch. See what I'm saying?

01:05:11.616 --> 01:05:15.244
Look, you've got to let him have it
point blank.

01:05:15.412 --> 01:05:17.913
It's over. Kaput. That's it!

01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:21.041
But, Ma, that seems very harsh.

01:05:26.339 --> 01:05:28.382
Cisco's trying to save himself.

01:05:28.550 --> 01:05:30.551
He's after all of us.

01:05:30.719 --> 01:05:33.012
He got Gump.

01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:34.513
My advice.

01:05:34.681 --> 01:05:37.766
Get the fuck out of Dodge now,
nigger.

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:40.728
There's a hit squad coming
for your ass right now.

01:05:40.895 --> 01:05:42.354
Peace. Out.

01:05:42.522 --> 01:05:43.981
Shit.

01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:02.207
Here's your prune juice, darling.

01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:04.209
Leave the bottle.

01:06:04.377 --> 01:06:05.711
Who's that?

01:06:09.424 --> 01:06:12.468
Hello. Is Melvin Smiley here?

01:06:12.636 --> 01:06:15.846
We're Melvin's co-workers.
We work in the same office.

01:06:16.014 --> 01:06:17.473
Really?

01:06:17.641 --> 01:06:21.894
- Is that chicken I smell?
- Have you eaten? Lunch?

01:06:22.062 --> 01:06:25.439
I haven't eaten all day.
Could you eat something?

01:06:25.607 --> 01:06:28.692
- Come on.
- You're so gracious. Thank you.

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:33.614
He's a devoted colleague. A man who
works for the betterment of society.

01:06:33.782 --> 01:06:36.533
So why does Melvin
work on weekends?

01:06:36.701 --> 01:06:38.535
He works with the homeless a lot.

01:06:38.703 --> 01:06:40.913
He sells computers to the homeless?

01:06:41.081 --> 01:06:45.334
You'd be surprised how many
homeless people buy computers.

01:06:45.502 --> 01:06:46.919
Oh, really?

01:06:48.296 --> 01:06:50.756
- Hello, Melvin.
- Hi, Melvin.

01:06:51.591 --> 01:06:54.760
You wanna talk about this outside?

01:06:54.928 --> 01:06:58.180
Sit down, Melvin.
I'd like to propose a toast.

01:06:59.474 --> 01:07:03.769
To my wife. A lovely woman,
who for the past eight years...

01:07:03.937 --> 01:07:07.940
...has cost me over $200,000...

01:07:08.108 --> 01:07:09.983
...in plastic surgery bills.

01:07:10.151 --> 01:07:12.736
And what was the end result
of all that surgery?

01:07:12.904 --> 01:07:16.156
A 57-year-old woman
with the face...

01:07:16.324 --> 01:07:19.576
...of a beautiful
25-year-old ape.

01:07:19.744 --> 01:07:22.204
- Oh, Morton!
- Shut your pisk!

01:07:22.372 --> 01:07:24.665
I'll have you know
that many men...

01:07:24.833 --> 01:07:27.543
...have found me to be
a ravishing creature.

01:07:28.712 --> 01:07:30.629
Don't you think I'm attractive still?

01:07:30.797 --> 01:07:33.632
- A ravishing creature?
- Yes. Certainly.

01:07:34.634 --> 01:07:35.968
Yeah, sure.

01:07:36.136 --> 01:07:39.805
I agree. You're a creature.

01:07:39.973 --> 01:07:41.932
Sit down! You're drunk.

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:44.226
To my darling daughter Pamela.

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:47.563
A princess.
My only child.

01:07:47.731 --> 01:07:50.107
And the source of constant pride...

01:07:50.275 --> 01:07:52.943
...to degenerate, manipulative...

01:07:53.111 --> 01:07:55.529
...gold-digging leeches
the world over.

01:07:55.697 --> 01:08:00.033
Which leads me
to my would-be son-in-law Melvin...

01:08:00.201 --> 01:08:03.620
...who's very charming
in a ¤ain ¤an kind of way.

01:08:03.788 --> 01:08:07.833
But obviously not good enough
for some parties.

01:08:08.001 --> 01:08:10.836
- I think you better...
- Sit down and shut your pisk.

01:08:11.004 --> 01:08:14.798
- Morton, please. Sit down!
- Where was I?

01:08:14.966 --> 01:08:18.510
The first thing we do when we meet
this young man is have a big fight.

01:08:18.678 --> 01:08:21.889
Then the young man comes to me
like Sidney Poitier...

01:08:22.055 --> 01:08:24.140
...¤¤ Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.

01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:26.350
A fine film, I might add.
And he proclaims:

01:08:26.519 --> 01:08:30.354
"I will not marry your daughter
unless I have your blessing."

01:08:30.523 --> 01:08:33.024
To which I say:

01:08:33.193 --> 01:08:35.152
"She doesn't deserve you.

01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:39.363
You deserve to be in an environment
of tolerance and brotherhood."

01:08:39.532 --> 01:08:44.703
When I see four men
of different races...

01:08:44.871 --> 01:08:48.916
...colours and creeds, sitting together
at the dinner table...

01:08:49.082 --> 01:08:52.044
...it fills me with hope.

01:08:52.212 --> 01:08:57.006
You four are what this country
is all about.

01:09:03.014 --> 01:09:05.557
Oh, gross!
You nasty mother...

01:09:14.526 --> 01:09:17.402
It's bonus time,
and guess who's the bonus.

01:09:21.366 --> 01:09:23.700
Yo, Mel. You pissed at me, baby?

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:26.036
Backstabbing motherfucker.
We're supposed to be friends.

01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:37.756
We're still friends. I just need space.
I still love you, baby.

01:09:39.801 --> 01:09:41.760
Yeah, just like you loved Gump, huh?

01:09:42.886 --> 01:09:45.764
It's every man for himself, Mel.

01:09:51.437 --> 01:09:54.273
Move it out.
Freddy, you're with me.

01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:02.322
- Pam?
- Yeah?

01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:05.284
- Were you gonna break up with me?
- Yeah.

01:10:09.789 --> 01:10:13.458
- I guess this is good-bye.
- Yes. Yes.

01:10:13.626 --> 01:10:15.460
I'm sorry about the meal.

01:10:15.628 --> 01:10:18.088
Things could be worse.

01:10:44.032 --> 01:10:45.741
He's getting away!

01:10:48.453 --> 01:10:50.746
Come on, move!

01:10:59.047 --> 01:11:03.759
"Don't worry, baby. This'll shave
four hours off our drive."

01:11:03.927 --> 01:11:07.095
We're right back where we started,
you fucking idiot!

01:11:08.181 --> 01:11:11.850
He's an animal.
I should've found the money.

01:11:12.018 --> 01:11:15.604
Don't worry. He won't hurt her now.
She's the only insurance he's got.

01:12:33.266 --> 01:12:35.100
That was intense!

01:12:35.268 --> 01:12:37.269
I'll be right back.

01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:40.605
Oh, God!

01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:43.275
- I think I broke my leg!
- Shit.

01:13:11.971 --> 01:13:15.015
Nice fucking driving, Mario.
Now get us out of here!

01:13:15.183 --> 01:13:18.393
You have Triple-A card?

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:21.021
Mine expired.

01:13:24.275 --> 01:13:26.109
He's got a gun.

01:13:30.948 --> 01:13:34.034
- You were gonna keep this?
- He wanted it.

01:13:35.578 --> 01:13:38.163
You should be ashamed of yourself.

01:13:43.628 --> 01:13:48.173
Melvin, I'm sorry.
Can we just talk about this?

01:13:48.341 --> 01:13:49.716
I love you!

01:13:52.011 --> 01:13:53.428
Shit!

01:14:07.151 --> 01:14:08.693
I wanted it?

01:14:08.861 --> 01:14:12.697
If you would've stayed your narrow ass
on the freeway like I told you to...

01:14:12.865 --> 01:14:14.783
...this wouldn't have happened.

01:14:22.875 --> 01:14:27.045
You wouldn't happen to know
where Melvin is headed, would you?

01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:37.222
You wouldn't happen to know where
Melvin might be headed, would you?

01:14:38.766 --> 01:14:40.225
Would you?

01:14:42.812 --> 01:14:46.273
- What happens now?
- I drop you off and you go home.

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:48.900
No, I mean,
what happens with us?

01:14:59.412 --> 01:15:02.247
If you're gonna be with me, there are
certain things you need to understand.

01:15:02.415 --> 01:15:04.499
I'm a contract killer.

01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:08.545
I murder people for money.
So far they've all been bad people.

01:15:08.713 --> 01:15:12.132
Give or take a few obnoxious ones.
That's what I do.

01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:15.135
- It's the only thing that I'm good at.
- I'm cool with that.

01:15:15.303 --> 01:15:17.429
If you stay with me,
your life's gonna be in danger.

01:15:17.597 --> 01:15:20.098
A constant adrenaline rush?
Are you kidding?

01:15:20.266 --> 01:15:23.351
- I like it.
- Understand this, okay?

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:28.607
I positively cannot be the only one
falling in love in this relationship.

01:15:28.774 --> 01:15:32.402
- It's got to be mutual.
- I'm feeling you, Skipper.

01:15:35.323 --> 01:15:37.282
I'm gonna return this tape.

01:15:37.450 --> 01:15:41.870
When I come back, if you really
want to, we'll disappear together.

01:16:18.824 --> 01:16:21.034
Stay still. Please.

01:16:22.828 --> 01:16:25.455
Oh, God. I'm gonna get us out of here.
Just calm down. Please.

01:16:25.623 --> 01:16:27.499
You don't seem that calm!

01:16:34.173 --> 01:16:35.966
Aw, shit.

01:16:36.133 --> 01:16:37.509
You okay?

01:16:39.011 --> 01:16:41.471
All right. We can get out the back.

01:16:49.689 --> 01:16:53.191
Come on. It's safe.
Just don't look down.

01:16:57.780 --> 01:16:59.197
Skipper, look.

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:02.993
Oh, shit.
You gotta get out of here.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:06.162
Meet me by the video store.
I gotta deal with this guy. Go!

01:19:42.862 --> 01:19:47.991
The most expensive stand-up in the
history of motion picture marketing.

01:19:48.159 --> 01:19:49.534
Awesome.

01:20:01.714 --> 01:20:02.714
Smiley.

01:20:08.053 --> 01:20:09.971
Here's your fucking tape back.

01:20:12.433 --> 01:20:14.559
Let's see here.

01:20:16.353 --> 01:20:18.271
Late charges.

01:20:21.442 --> 01:20:23.735
What's this?

01:20:23.903 --> 01:20:27.071
Tape's not rewound?
That's gonna cost you!

01:20:27.239 --> 01:20:29.824
I've taken a lot of shit from you.

01:20:29.992 --> 01:20:32.744
I put up with your high prices,
your lousy selection.

01:20:32.912 --> 01:20:35.455
- Your rude phone calls.
- Sorry about that.

01:20:35.623 --> 01:20:37.957
- I want to tell you one thing.
- What?

01:20:38.125 --> 01:20:41.169
I will never rent tapes
from this store again, you snotty...

01:20:43.881 --> 01:20:46.257
I'm gonna finish what I started,
motherfucker.

01:20:52.932 --> 01:20:54.891
No, please.

01:20:55.935 --> 01:20:58.102
Knuckle up, bitch.

01:20:58.270 --> 01:21:00.438
Let's go, motherfucker.
Let's work.

01:21:13.118 --> 01:21:15.495
- Where's the girl?
- I let her go.

01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:24.963
You let that bitch go? I can't believe
how fucking stupid you are, man.

01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:27.465
- She ain't no bitch.
- Oh, she's not a bitch.

01:21:27.633 --> 01:21:32.136
I see. You like this girl.
Come on! She tricked you, fool.

01:21:32.304 --> 01:21:35.056
Just another ho manipulating
your sorry ass to get what she wants.

01:21:36.392 --> 01:21:38.309
You don't know what you're
talking about. That's not true.

01:21:38.477 --> 01:21:41.980
Haven't I taught you nothing?
She don't like you.

01:21:42.147 --> 01:21:44.399
Hell, I don't fucking like you.

01:22:03.961 --> 01:22:08.131
You was nothing. I got you a job,
taught you everything you know.

01:22:09.842 --> 01:22:13.803
Remember that promise I made about
my boat? I lied. You ain't getting shit.

01:22:13.971 --> 01:22:15.471
I don't give a fuck!

01:23:04.938 --> 01:23:06.314
Son of a bitch!

01:23:11.153 --> 01:23:13.237
Ain't that a bitch!

01:23:17.368 --> 01:23:21.371
All I wanted to do
was to sail my boat, man.

01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:23.539
You know?

01:23:24.541 --> 01:23:26.459
Navigate by the stars.

01:23:27.711 --> 01:23:30.880
See dolphins racing alongside,
you know?

01:23:31.048 --> 01:23:33.007
Maybe even kill a few of them.

01:23:36.095 --> 01:23:37.970
Yo, Mel...

01:23:38.889 --> 01:23:40.807
...I can almost see it.

01:23:41.725 --> 01:23:43.935
It's fucking beautiful.

01:23:49.733 --> 01:23:51.734
I'm here, buddy.

01:23:51.902 --> 01:23:54.028
I can't see it no more.

01:23:55.572 --> 01:23:58.116
I can see it.
You're there, man.

01:23:59.034 --> 01:24:01.994
You're there now.
Right there on the deck.

01:24:02.162 --> 01:24:05.039
It's just you and the sea.
One on one.

01:24:06.417 --> 01:24:08.584
You're free now.

01:26:07.538 --> 01:26:08.788
Why?

01:26:16.755 --> 01:26:21.092
That is so cool. I can't believe they're
making a movie about your kidnapping.

01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:23.803
My dad's in L.A. Finalizing the deal.

01:26:23.971 --> 01:26:26.973
This is such a story.
Your dad was totally broke.

01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:30.518
Then you get kidnapped and now
they're making a big Hollywood movie?

01:26:30.686 --> 01:26:33.312
Your dad must be so happy.

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:36.524
Yeah, everything's back to normal.
My ride's here. I gotta go.

01:26:47.536 --> 01:26:48.911
Straight home, ma'am?

01:26:49.079 --> 01:26:52.456
Or would you like to just get away
from it all?

01:27:12.769 --> 01:27:15.187
- I don't understand.
- Thanks, Vince. Let's go.

01:27:15.355 --> 01:27:17.315
You got it, kid.

01:27:18.442 --> 01:27:22.486
You know your dad's movie display?
It was really well made.

01:27:37.878 --> 01:27:40.296
- So?
- Yeah?

01:27:40.464 --> 01:27:42.298
Are we gonna disappear or what?

01:27:42.466 --> 01:27:44.342
You're the man.
