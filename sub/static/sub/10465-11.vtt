Hey.

00:04.701 --> 00:06.334
What you doing?

00:06.334 --> 00:08.801
Just sealing
some attic joists.

00:08.801 --> 00:10.100
Why would you have to seal stuff

00:10.100 --> 00:12.133
that's gonna be
inside the attic?

00:12.133 --> 00:14.901
You gonna have to seal me too
because I live up there?

Roof changes temperature
all the time.

00:16.667 --> 00:18.100

Where are you going?

00:22.467 --> 00:24.133
I got some work upstairs.

00:24.133 --> 00:25.334
Sam, can you stop?

00:25.334 --> 00:26.801
Can we stop this, because

00:26.801 --> 00:28.667
it's kind of obvious
you're avoiding me.

00:28.667 --> 00:30.033
I'm not avoiding you.

00:30.033 --> 00:31.868
Every time I come near you,
it's--

00:31.868 --> 00:34.000
It's some new excuse as to why
you have to be at--

00:34.000 --> 00:35.901
I don't know at the opposite end
of the house.

00:35.901 --> 00:38.734
I'm just...

00:38.734 --> 00:40.267
I'm doing my job. Okay?

00:40.267 --> 00:42.834
Uh-huh. And so why are you
backing away from me?

00:42.834 --> 00:44.601
Because...

00:47.334 --> 00:48.834
I'm avoiding you, okay?

00:48.834 --> 00:50.701
Sam--

00:50.701 --> 00:53.000
Look, Julia, I'm sorry,
but th-this-- This thing

00:53.000 --> 00:58.334
that you think is happening, I
mean, us... whatever, it's not.

You're 16.

Seventeen.
And I'm 24

doesn't make any-- Any sense.

01:05.667 --> 01:06.667
Why?

01:06.667 --> 01:07.734
No. I-- I mean, it.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.501
Give me one good reason.

01:09.501 --> 01:11.167
How about you're still
in high school,

01:11.167 --> 01:13.167

You-- You can't vote.

01:16.234 --> 01:18.100

01:18.100 --> 01:19.434
You can barely even drive.

01:19.434 --> 01:20.601
I said a good reason.

01:20.601 --> 01:22.834
Julia, please.
I mean, we kissed each other.

01:22.834 --> 01:24.434
No, no, no. You kissed me.

01:24.434 --> 01:26.734
And you kissed me back.
Don't deny it.

01:26.734 --> 01:28.133
I was there.
I'm not doing this.

01:28.133 --> 01:30.701

Like, all the time,

01:30.701 --> 01:33.267
and hang out with each other.
I mean, I'm not imagining this.

01:33.267 --> 01:35.033
You didn't just happen
to end up in my room

for no reason.

01:36.601 --> 01:37.934

about this so much

01:40.100 --> 01:41.601
if you didn't think I was right.

01:41.601 --> 01:42.901
That is not the point.

01:42.901 --> 01:44.067
So, what is the point?

01:44.067 --> 01:45.801
The-- The point is,
is that it-- It--

09:13.701 --> 09:16.968
It's fine.

So if you choked, I couldn't
give you a Heimlich?

09:19.534 --> 09:21.000
I'm only trying to help.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.300
Look, could we not do this right
now if-- If you don't mind?

09:24.300 --> 09:28.033
So now it's we can't even
be friends?

09:28.033 --> 09:30.667

I think it's so great

09:36.434 --> 09:37.868
that you guys met on a plane.

09:37.868 --> 09:39.400

[BOTH LAUGH]
JOE: Oh, yeah, I'll tell you.

09:41.267 --> 09:42.667
It was a crazy flight.

09:42.667 --> 09:44.634
First, the movie broke
halfway through,

09:44.634 --> 09:46.734
and people were very rowdy
about that.

09:46.734 --> 09:47.901
And then some little kid,

09:47.901 --> 09:50.567
he locks himself
in the bathroom for two hours.

09:50.567 --> 09:52.801
And there was turbulence,
not a little,

09:52.801 --> 09:54.567
and we're bouncing
all over the place.

09:54.567 --> 09:56.267
And I'm handing Joey
some orange juice,

09:56.267 --> 09:57.834
and right then
the plane jolts.

09:57.834 --> 10:01.367
And everybody screams, and juice
goes flying everywhere.

10:01.367 --> 10:04.100
All over his pants, his shirt,
the book he's reading.

10:04.100 --> 10:06.200
I didn't know whether
to laugh or cry.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.667
But then I look at him,
and he's smiling at me

10:08.667 --> 10:10.334
just like he is right now.

10:10.334 --> 10:12.534
And I said, "What else is gonna
happen on this trip?"

10:12.534 --> 10:15.467
And he says, "Who knows?

10:15.467 --> 10:17.501
Maybe something wonderful."

10:17.501 --> 10:19.267

Aw!

to go to bed, huh?

Good night, Owen.

10:29.267 --> 10:30.534
Well, Franny,

10:30.534 --> 10:32.601
getting married ought to be
pretty easy for you.

10:32.601 --> 10:35.167
Seeing as you have all that
experience walking down aisles.

10:35.167 --> 10:36.167

Oh, God.

10:36.167 --> 10:37.534
Right. And instead of rice,

10:37.534 --> 10:39.501
we can give people little
packets of peanuts.

10:39.501 --> 10:42.400
Would you guys please? I mean,
a little reverence.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.934

happened in a really long time.

where you hide the decaf?

I'm getting it.

11:08.434 --> 11:09.901
No. I don't care
about the coffee.

11:09.901 --> 11:11.634
You barely spoke
two words all night.

11:13.634 --> 11:15.234
You know, Charlie, I, um--

11:15.234 --> 11:18.033
I heard a little bit about
what happened to Kirsten.

11:18.033 --> 11:20.400
Not much. Just what
the kids told me.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.601
I don't know if it's something
you wanna talk about.

11:22.601 --> 11:24.501
No.
Okay. Okay.

11:26.634 --> 11:28.000
So, what do you think of her?

11:29.934 --> 11:31.300
She's nice.

11:31.300 --> 11:35.701
I was hoping for a little more
enthusiasm from my best man.

11:35.701 --> 11:37.968
You-- You will be my best man,
won't you?

If you want me to.

11:43.701 --> 11:44.968

But?

11:44.968 --> 11:46.334
There's a "but"?

11:46.334 --> 11:48.200
Well, you don't--

11:48.200 --> 11:51.067
You haven't known her very long,
Joe.

11:51.067 --> 11:52.334
I mean, a month?

11:52.334 --> 11:56.367
Well, I know her long enough
to know I love her.

11:56.367 --> 11:59.133
What am I gonna accomplish
by waiting, Charlie?

11:59.133 --> 12:00.133
I'm 50 years old.

12:00.133 --> 12:02.133
Right.

12:02.133 --> 12:05.200
You're 50, and she's what?

12:05.200 --> 12:06.534
A little older than I am?

12:06.534 --> 12:08.701
Thirty? Maybe 31?
That's-- That's 20--

She's 30.
I'm 20 years older.

What are you giving me
numbers for?

12:14.100 --> 12:16.634
Didn't you notice how much we
love each other?

12:16.634 --> 12:18.033
Hey, you asked me
and I told you--

12:18.033 --> 12:19.300
Why are you doing this?

12:19.300 --> 12:20.300
Doing what?

12:20.300 --> 12:22.601
You're being so-- I don't know.

12:22.601 --> 12:25.200
This doesn't feel like you,
Charlie. You're not even here.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.167
It's like you're completely
somewhere else.

12:27.167 --> 12:28.534
Oh, cut it out, Joe.

12:28.534 --> 12:31.467
What the hell's that mean,
I'm not even here? God.

the easiest time for you,

12:33.567 --> 12:36.067
and I know that
you miss Kirsten.

12:36.067 --> 12:38.701
And I'm not gonna
take that away from you,

12:38.701 --> 12:42.334

12:42.334 --> 12:43.667
this is a good thing.

12:45.167 --> 12:47.801

and we need to celebrate this.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.400
So I'm gonna
go back in there.

to be happy for us.

Is that new?

13:10.834 --> 13:12.133

13:12.133 --> 13:13.400
I'm doing labels.

13:13.400 --> 13:16.400
I hate labels.

13:16.400 --> 13:18.100

near Salinger's

on the program.

of people you need to talk to.

but really, thanks.

So, uh, are you free on Sunday?

13:40.634 --> 13:43.834

together and do something?

13:43.834 --> 13:45.534

13:45.534 --> 13:47.601

ever stick?

even let me--

13:51.868 --> 13:53.100
There's this wedding.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.501
Oh, in that case,
definitely, no.

at that dance? That was nothing.

somebody to a wedding?

"Where'd you two meet?
How long have you been dating?"

14:03.467 --> 14:04.767

14:04.767 --> 14:06.334
like a fun way to spend
an afternoon.

14:06.334 --> 14:09.801
Look, I went to the dance,
the charity thing,

14:09.801 --> 14:11.400
and you said you'd
return the favor.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.968
I distinctly remember
you saying that.

14:13.968 --> 14:16.601
So ask me to the next charity
thing you have to go to.

14:16.601 --> 14:18.701
Believe me, this would
definitely be considered

14:18.701 --> 14:19.901
an act of charity.

a wedding gift yet?

not gonna finish?

that Julia Salinger called

15:03.234 --> 15:07.467
of the Salinger job,
which he did not, like, finish.

15:07.467 --> 15:09.033

to call me?

I'm embarrassed for you.

who's not even interested.

This is none of your business.

if you're totally pathetic,

more attractive.

and he kissed me back.
