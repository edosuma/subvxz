14:37.609 --> 14:38.976
[ Screams ]

14:40.445 --> 14:43.047
Huh?
Whoa!
Who are you dudes?

14:43.114 --> 14:46.484
There's no time to explain.
You've got to come with us
to the future.

14:46.551 --> 14:48.219
Where are Donatello
and Raphael?

14:48.286 --> 14:51.488
Prepare for your end, reptiles!

14:52.157 --> 14:53.924
[ Screaming ]

14:54.592 --> 14:55.959
Hands in the air, guys!

14:56.027 --> 14:58.662
Donatello, Raphael,
we must go, quickly.

14:58.730 --> 15:01.465
Uh, sorry.
You must tell us
who you are, quickly.

15:01.533 --> 15:05.202
And if we don't like
what we hear, we will trash you
even more quickly.

15:05.270 --> 15:08.205
Not before I fry you,
Turtles!

15:10.007 --> 15:11.742
[ Screaming ]

15:11.809 --> 15:15.178
I can't hold on!
[ Screams ]

15:15.246 --> 15:16.814
Leonardo!

15:20.218 --> 15:22.386
[ All Screaming ]

15:26.057 --> 15:27.925
[ All Grunting ]

15:27.993 --> 15:31.728
Whoa, what happened?
Where are we?
You're in the lair.

15:31.796 --> 15:34.864
Yes, we are.
But, um--
Do we know you?

15:34.932 --> 15:37.568
Sure you know me, man.
I mean, you will.

15:37.636 --> 15:40.571
In exactly two years
and 15 days.

15:40.639 --> 15:44.575
Who are you?
I'm Landor.
This is Merrik.

15:44.643 --> 15:48.378
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Time out.
You lost me with that first turn
you took into the twilight zone.

15:48.446 --> 15:49.846
It's simple really.

15:49.915 --> 15:52.216
We're time travelers.
This is your future.

15:52.284 --> 15:54.918
That's impossible!
Isn't it?

15:54.986 --> 15:57.154
Uh, well,
according to Einstein--

15:57.222 --> 16:00.224
Look, we don't have time
for a lecture
on the theory of relativity.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.059
We've gotta stop
Shredder and Krang...

16:02.127 --> 16:04.494
before they get
the Technodrome
out of Dimension X!

16:04.562 --> 16:06.530
Do not worry, Leonardo.

16:06.598 --> 16:08.566
You will destroy
the Technodrome.

16:08.633 --> 16:09.967
How do you know, Sensei?

16:10.034 --> 16:13.203
I know because I am
the sensei of your future.

16:13.271 --> 16:16.006
Your future selves
are trapped
in an alien ship.

16:16.074 --> 16:20.411
Unless you help us get them
a life energy transfusion,
they won't make it.

16:20.479 --> 16:21.912
It's true.

16:21.979 --> 16:23.647
This isn't our time continuum.

16:23.714 --> 16:26.850
No. And if you stay here
more than 24 hours,

16:26.918 --> 16:28.385
you will cease to exist.

16:28.453 --> 16:30.821
And I thought
turning into a pumpkin
was a drag.

16:30.888 --> 16:32.689
We've got to get back
to our time.

16:32.757 --> 16:35.659
If you need us,
just bounce another message
off a star.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.764
Come on!
I'll fill you in
on the way.

16:42.334 --> 16:45.169
<i>[ Dregg ]</i>
<i>Mung, any sign</i>
<i>of Shredder and Krang?</i>

16:45.236 --> 16:49.706
Not yet, my lord.
But the transporter is ready
to extract the steel.

16:49.774 --> 16:51.675
Very well.
Proceed.

17:11.796 --> 17:16.165
Thank you, Shredder.
I've got my strength again.

17:16.233 --> 17:21.204
Good. Now all we have to do
is get rid of that
brain-draining Dregg,

17:21.271 --> 17:24.107
and the world will be ours
for the taking!

17:26.310 --> 17:29.112
- What?
- No! Oh, no.

17:31.016 --> 17:33.016
[ Shouts ]

17:34.152 --> 17:36.553
[ Carter ]
The nuclear power plant
is up ahead.

17:36.620 --> 17:38.756
Whoa, dudes.
What's that?

17:45.096 --> 17:46.263
Hang on!

17:49.967 --> 17:51.968
Whoa, dude, cool landing.

17:52.036 --> 17:54.971
[ Groans ]
It was pretty trashy
if you ask me.

17:55.039 --> 17:57.841
[ Leonardo ]
At least we're headed downriver
toward the power plant.

18:10.088 --> 18:14.858
Go!
Build Lord Dregg an army
of invasion craft!

18:19.997 --> 18:23.434
[ Groans ]
I think it's this way.

18:23.502 --> 18:26.971
Please, April.
Can't I just pull my shell
over my head...

18:27.038 --> 18:29.205
and take a nap
for a few eons?

18:29.273 --> 18:30.741
Sorry, Raphael.

18:30.809 --> 18:32.810
I've got to get you all
back to Earth.

18:38.116 --> 18:40.650
Guys!
I think I found
the transporter room!

18:46.591 --> 18:48.792
Something's... not right.

18:50.662 --> 18:53.330
[ Leonardo ]
This isn't the transporter room.

18:53.398 --> 18:57.234
No, it's a...
fusion engine.

18:57.736 --> 19:00.003
[ Groans ]

19:00.071 --> 19:01.671
There's no way out!

19:01.739 --> 19:05.643
If Dregg starts the engines,
we're turtle vapor.

19:10.982 --> 19:12.916
Get ready!

19:12.984 --> 19:16.420
What are those legs?
There's no time
to worry about that now.

19:16.488 --> 19:18.222
I'll set
the transporter coordinates.

19:18.289 --> 19:20.390
You guys take care
of the guards.

19:20.458 --> 19:22.993
Hey, who checked out
and made him the big cheese?

19:23.061 --> 19:26.830
According to Splinter, we did.
Our future selves.

19:35.272 --> 19:36.707
Guards!

19:36.774 --> 19:38.575
Guys!
Go for the transporter!

19:42.080 --> 19:44.414
Cowabunga!

19:46.751 --> 19:50.220
[ Leonardo ]
Wow! And I thought
the Technodrome was awesome.

19:54.092 --> 19:55.525
Follow me!

19:58.596 --> 20:00.163
April?

20:00.231 --> 20:03.433
Please, tell me you didn't
yank us out of the past
just for this.

20:03.501 --> 20:06.369
Well, you--
Uh, I mean,
<i>they</i> couldn't have gotten far.

20:06.437 --> 20:08.172
[ Michelangelo ]
Well, that's really reassuring.

20:11.542 --> 20:14.611
Sorry, they're not
behind Door Number 2 either.

20:14.678 --> 20:17.681
You may have escaped
my force fields, reptiles,

20:17.748 --> 20:19.415
but you won't escape again!

20:20.084 --> 20:21.285
[ All ]
Whoa!

20:23.087 --> 20:24.621
Do we know that dude?

20:24.689 --> 20:26.189
No, and I don't want to.

20:26.257 --> 20:29.559
You can't withstand
my power, fools.

20:32.363 --> 20:33.864
Fire drill!

20:33.931 --> 20:35.799
[ Screams ]

20:39.704 --> 20:42.472
Come on, Carter!
Mutate!

20:47.312 --> 20:49.245
Sorry, no go on Door Number 3.

20:49.313 --> 20:51.282
Let's get that alien twerp!

20:54.218 --> 20:56.119
Foolish creatures.

20:56.187 --> 20:57.988
I've only been toying with you.

20:59.257 --> 21:02.893
Now, you shall feel
the wrath of Dregg!

21:03.728 --> 21:05.062
Whoa!
[ Moans ]

21:05.129 --> 21:07.564
I won't miss this time.

21:07.631 --> 21:09.299
No!

21:10.835 --> 21:14.538
You shall be the first
to enter oblivion.

21:19.043 --> 21:20.643
Whoa!

21:20.711 --> 21:23.680
I hope this Carter dude's
really on our side.

21:25.049 --> 21:27.551
Oh, no. No!
The engine's starting!

21:30.221 --> 21:31.888
Hang in there,
mutant dude!

21:31.956 --> 21:34.057
Turtle cavalry's on the way!

21:39.230 --> 21:40.798
Ah!
[ Sighs ]

21:43.334 --> 21:48.571
April, divert the fusion stream
into the engine wall.

you did it!

22:12.797 --> 22:15.599
Yo, those dudes
sure look like us.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.934
Michelangelo,
they <i> are</i> us.

22:18.002 --> 22:20.203
Oh, that would explain
the resemblance.

22:20.271 --> 22:23.473
Either there's a mirror
on the ceiling,

22:23.541 --> 22:27.076
or I'm having a major
out-of-shell experience.

22:27.144 --> 22:29.646

Come on, guys.
Let's get 'em out of here.
