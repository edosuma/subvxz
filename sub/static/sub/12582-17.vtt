00:33.450 --> 00:35.884
We are now finished
with the American history

00:35.919 --> 00:37.682
portion of our class.

00:37.721 --> 00:41.885
So today we begin
our unit on Texas history.

00:41.925 --> 00:45.952
Yes! Texas history!
I can't wait to tell my dad!

00:45.995 --> 00:47.724
There'll be steaks
for dinner tonight.

00:47.764 --> 00:51.860
My book is broken.

00:51.901 --> 00:54.927
Well, listen more carefully.

00:54.971 --> 00:56.438
Tada!

00:56.473 --> 00:58.202
New textbooks?

00:58.241 --> 01:00.402
They're so,
they're so beautiful.

01:00.443 --> 01:02.308
Now don't let the science
teachers hear about this.

01:02.345 --> 01:03.676
Their bunsen burners
have been hooked up

01:03.713 --> 01:04.873
to nothing for years.

01:04.914 --> 01:07.678
I never even
seen a new textbook.

01:07.717 --> 01:10.277
Now I get to decide
who gets mustaches

01:10.320 --> 01:11.878
and who gets devil horns.

01:11.921 --> 01:13.752
Okay, now remember
these represent

01:13.790 --> 01:15.121
Texas and a lot of money.

01:15.158 --> 01:18.252
So keep your naked ladies
and your words to rock songs

01:18.294 --> 01:19.454
out of the margins.

01:19.496 --> 01:22.488
You doodle in these books

01:22.532 --> 01:26.093
and I am going
to doodle you an F.

01:26.136 --> 01:30.129
Now that's what I call
a clean pair of glasses.

01:30.173 --> 01:31.800
What are you looking for, Bobby?

01:31.841 --> 01:33.775
A cover for my new text book.

01:33.810 --> 01:36.608
Fire up the grill, Dad,
we just started Texas history.

01:36.646 --> 01:38.204
Texas history?

01:38.248 --> 01:42.514
Son, today you are officially
a Texan. Congratulations.

01:42.552 --> 01:46.283
Bobby, you can't cover
a book that important

01:46.322 --> 01:48.119
with aluminum foil.

01:48.158 --> 01:49.386
You need to use a paper bag.

01:49.425 --> 01:50.517
Okay.

01:50.560 --> 01:52.255
This one's pretty.

01:52.295 --> 01:53.660
No!

01:53.696 --> 01:57.291
I've got a brown
paper bag in the garage.

01:57.333 --> 01:58.732
And your mother only went here

01:58.768 --> 02:00.235
to buy athletic socks.

02:00.270 --> 02:03.899
They make a very
good athletic sock.

02:05.408 --> 02:07.399
I'm sorry, I can't
go walking, Sug.

02:07.443 --> 02:09.308
I have to answer this mail
that came to the station.

02:09.345 --> 02:10.607
Well, that's okay.

02:10.646 --> 02:12.080
I'm on that
all-you-can-eat bacon diet

02:12.115 --> 02:14.174
and my time would probably
be better spent

02:14.217 --> 02:16.014
eating more bacon.

02:16.052 --> 02:17.076
Listen to this.

02:17.120 --> 02:19.111
"Because of your
inaccurate forecast,

02:19.155 --> 02:20.588
"my wedding was ruined,

02:20.623 --> 02:21.612
you ass."

02:21.658 --> 02:22.784
Oh, my God,
look at that picture.

02:22.826 --> 02:24.088
She is dripping wet.

02:24.127 --> 02:27.858
This, Sug, is the ugly
side of meteorology.

02:27.897 --> 02:29.296
It isn't all
free makeup samples

02:29.332 --> 02:30.526
and riding in a convertible

02:30.567 --> 02:31.591
in the Arlen Day parade.

02:31.634 --> 02:33.033
What the hell is this?

02:33.069 --> 02:36.334
Some kind of voodoo doll?
My nose is not that big.

02:36.372 --> 02:37.396
That is Flat Stanley.

02:37.440 --> 02:38.964
Teachers have their students

02:39.008 --> 02:40.805
send them out
to far away places.

02:40.844 --> 02:42.402
Then you take pictures of him,

02:42.445 --> 02:43.434
send it back,

02:43.479 --> 02:45.037
and the kids learn
about geography.

02:45.081 --> 02:47.811
What do these people
want from me?

02:47.851 --> 02:49.512
I am not God.

02:49.552 --> 02:52.487
Although I am not
teaching at school this week,

02:52.522 --> 02:54.683
the world
is my classroom, Nancy.

02:54.724 --> 02:56.851
I'll take care
of Flat Stanley.

02:56.893 --> 02:59.191
Now, I'll start
with a photo at Lake Arlen.

02:59.229 --> 03:01.197
Is it going to rain today?

03:01.231 --> 03:03.324
Why am I asking you?

03:04.801 --> 03:06.735
Well, Bobby sure is lucky.

03:06.769 --> 03:08.031
He's got 30 more years

03:08.071 --> 03:10.335
of Texas history
to learn then we did.

03:10.373 --> 03:13.900
I defy anyone to sit
through that class

03:13.943 --> 03:15.740
without becoming a man
of courage and conviction.

03:15.778 --> 03:17.905
I truly believe
that if I hadn't

03:17.947 --> 03:20.643
taken Texas history
I'd be dead by my own hand.

03:21.951 --> 03:24.647
Dad, you've got to help me!

03:24.687 --> 03:26.052
My first Texas history test

03:26.089 --> 03:28.148
is tomorrow
and I left my textbook

03:28.191 --> 03:29.283
at school!

03:29.325 --> 03:30.451
Can't use Joseph's!

03:30.493 --> 03:31.824
Don't worry.
I still have

03:31.861 --> 03:33.021
my old textbook.

03:33.062 --> 03:34.586
You can study from that.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.223
Didn't they make
you turn it in?

03:36.266 --> 03:37.699
The student with
the highest grade

03:37.734 --> 03:39.258
got to keep their textbook.

03:39.302 --> 03:42.169
Back then they knew
how to motivate a teenager.

03:44.307 --> 03:45.672
Thanks, Dad.

03:45.708 --> 03:48.472
I don't want to fail
and end up in summer school.

03:48.511 --> 03:51.241
There's no air conditioning
and half the kids are pregnant.

03:51.281 --> 03:52.873
Well, no son of mine
is going to flunk

03:52.916 --> 03:54.440
Texas history.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.418
Now what does the test cover?

03:56.452 --> 03:59.182
Texas 1830 to 1840.

03:59.222 --> 04:00.780
That's the Texas Revolution.

04:00.823 --> 04:03.883
If you were only going to learn
one piece of Texas history,

04:03.927 --> 04:05.121
that'd be the one.

04:05.161 --> 04:08.653
New Year's Day, 1830.

04:08.698 --> 04:11.258
The smell of fresh
chopped cottonwood

04:11.301 --> 04:13.599
wafted across the plains.

04:13.636 --> 04:15.194
This isn't in the book,

04:15.238 --> 04:17.331
I just wanted to set the mood.

04:19.274 --> 04:21.675
Now this is the perfect place

04:21.711 --> 04:23.406
to take a picture
of Flat Stanley.

04:23.446 --> 04:25.505
More frozen poultry
passes through this

04:25.548 --> 04:27.106
loading dock than any other

04:27.150 --> 04:28.481
in Heimlich County.

04:28.518 --> 04:31.248
It is like the Ellis Island
for dead chickens.

04:31.287 --> 04:34.814
Aunt Peggy, I have
a Flat Stanley question.

04:34.857 --> 04:36.119
Why is he flat?

04:36.159 --> 04:39.390
Exactly, Luanne.

04:39.429 --> 04:41.158
And if you're asking that,
how many other

04:41.197 --> 04:43.131
eight-year-olds
who send us Stanley,

04:43.166 --> 04:44.690
ask the same thing.

04:44.734 --> 04:47.259
Why is Flat Stanley flat?

04:48.871 --> 04:52.568
Because he wasn't careful
and got tragically

04:52.608 --> 04:54.940
and painfully flattened.

04:54.978 --> 04:57.640
Flat Stanley can do more than
just teach geography.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.045
He can save lives.

04:59.082 --> 05:01.141
Put him under that semi.

05:01.184 --> 05:06.622
I will call this one
Look Both Ways Before Dying.

05:08.057 --> 05:10.150
Dad, I failed!

05:10.193 --> 05:11.285
Failed what?

05:11.327 --> 05:12.794
My Texas history test.

05:12.829 --> 05:15.627
Looks like I'm on my way
to summer school.

05:15.665 --> 05:17.223
But how?
We went over everything.

05:17.266 --> 05:18.392
Didn't you listen?

05:18.434 --> 05:22.530
Yes! Steven F. Austin,
imprisoned 1833!

05:22.572 --> 05:24.665
Battle of Gonzalez, 1835!

05:24.707 --> 05:28.040
But none of that stuff
was on the test.

05:28.077 --> 05:30.807
"The planting of the
first Poinsettias?"

05:30.847 --> 05:33.611
Is that your new book?
Let me see it.

05:33.649 --> 05:36.083
"The Introduction
of the Accordion"?

05:36.119 --> 05:38.383
A whole chapter on Selena?

05:38.421 --> 05:40.150
Where are the chapters
about the Alamo?

05:40.189 --> 05:41.816
Oh, here we go.

05:41.858 --> 05:45.794
"The Alamo was a mission
in present-day San Antonio.

05:45.828 --> 05:48.558
Population 1.5 million."

05:48.598 --> 05:49.997
That's it?

05:50.033 --> 05:52.331
Maybe the Alamo
just isn't that important.

05:52.368 --> 05:55.098
It is the most inspiring event

05:55.138 --> 05:57.402
in all of Texas history!

05:57.440 --> 06:01.001
Heroes giving their lives so
that Texas could be free.

06:01.044 --> 06:02.306
There's got to be more in here.

06:02.345 --> 06:03.539
Wait, wait.

06:03.579 --> 06:05.911
I think I saw something else
about it.

06:07.483 --> 06:10.941
Oh, that's the
first Taco Bell.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.657
How can you call a book
Texas history

06:17.693 --> 06:19.627
when there's barely
any history in it?

06:19.662 --> 06:21.289
You familiar with
a little thing

06:21.330 --> 06:23.127
called the
"Serenity Prayer," Hank?

06:23.166 --> 06:25.361
Because this is one
of those things I can't change.

06:25.401 --> 06:27.892
But where's the Texas history
we grew up with, Carl?

06:27.937 --> 06:29.063
You wore a coonskin cap

06:29.105 --> 06:31.164
from the eighth through
the 11th grade.

06:31.207 --> 06:33.300
Davy Crockett isn't even
mentioned in here.

06:33.342 --> 06:36.311
Sorry, Hank, but you're going to
have to take your complaint

06:36.345 --> 06:37.369
to the school board.

06:37.413 --> 06:38.880
Hey, and while you're there,

06:38.915 --> 06:41.008
could you ask 'em
why it's taking so long

06:41.050 --> 06:42.142
to get some chalk?

06:42.185 --> 06:43.982
But don't say
I told you to ask.

06:46.889 --> 06:51.155
: Now, firearm safety is one
of the most important issues

06:51.194 --> 06:52.821
facing our children today.

06:52.862 --> 06:54.159
Would it be easier

06:54.197 --> 06:56.665
to just have the children
not to shoot guns?

06:56.699 --> 06:58.189
Snap out of your
dream world, Luanne!

06:59.335 --> 07:00.029
Fire!

07:02.538 --> 07:03.630
Aunt Peggy, no!

07:03.673 --> 07:06.437
How many times does
he have to get shot?

07:06.476 --> 07:09.445
Until he learns his lesson.

07:11.447 --> 07:14.245
Mr. Hill, these are several
factors we have to consider

07:14.283 --> 07:15.511
when ordering textbooks.

07:15.551 --> 07:17.485
They have to be relevant
to today's kids

07:17.520 --> 07:18.748
and hold their attention.

07:18.788 --> 07:20.653
We're competing against
MTV, you know.

07:20.690 --> 07:21.782
No, you're not.

07:21.824 --> 07:24.088
The fact is, some things
just have to go.

07:24.127 --> 07:27.426
Our lawyers are very concerned
about the weight of books.

07:27.463 --> 07:30.330
Do you know how long it
takes for a 60-pound kid

07:30.366 --> 07:33.062
with a 20-pound backpack
to destroy his back?

07:33.102 --> 07:34.660
2.5 years.

07:34.704 --> 07:37.002
We actually used
that question in the new math books.

07:37.039 --> 07:38.563
But the Texas Revolution,

07:38.608 --> 07:40.542
how could you not include that?

07:40.576 --> 07:42.567
It was making a lot
of people uncomfortable.

07:42.612 --> 07:43.579
Who?!

07:43.613 --> 07:44.580
Lawyers, mostly.

07:44.614 --> 07:46.514
But these kids are Texans.

07:46.549 --> 07:48.813
They need to feel like Texans.

07:48.851 --> 07:51.911
Yeah! These kids aren't
learning anything!

07:51.954 --> 07:53.285
Well...

07:53.322 --> 07:54.812
...you got Tuttle's vote.

07:54.857 --> 07:57.155
Maybe the two of you can build
some kind of coalition

07:57.193 --> 08:02.654
and come back when we order our
next new textbooks... in 2032.

08:07.570 --> 08:08.764
Bruce Tuttle.

08:08.804 --> 08:10.772
I was here trying to get
some seed money

08:10.806 --> 08:13.468
for an educational film
of the life and times of LBJ.

08:13.509 --> 08:14.942
They wouldn't spring for it.

08:14.977 --> 08:16.706
LBJ would make a great movie.

08:16.746 --> 08:19.010
And in this "textbook"
all they've got

08:19.048 --> 08:22.040
is one picture of him lifting
his dog by the ears.

08:22.084 --> 08:23.108
And that was for a unit

08:23.152 --> 08:25.746
on active seniors.

08:25.788 --> 08:28.052
Fighting those idiots
has got me starving.

08:28.090 --> 08:29.114
You hungry?

08:29.158 --> 08:30.386
I could eat.

08:32.260 --> 08:34.821
There's more Texas history
on this place mat

08:34.864 --> 08:37.128
than in all of my son
Bobby's textbook.

08:37.166 --> 08:38.565
You know, down near
San Antonio

08:38.601 --> 08:41.365
they do a reenactment of the
Battle of Goliad every week.

08:41.404 --> 08:43.462
It stinks, but at least
they got their shot.

08:43.506 --> 08:46.134
Hey, if they can do that,
why can't we put on

08:46.175 --> 08:47.836
a reenactment of the Alamo?

08:47.877 --> 08:50.243
That'd be a great way
to teach the kids.

08:50.279 --> 08:52.907
Sure. But there's no way the
school board would pay for it.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.211
Maybe they won't have to.

08:54.250 --> 08:56.343
I bet Buck Strickland
will foot the bill.

08:56.385 --> 08:58.751
He was talking about
sponsoring a soccer team,

08:58.788 --> 09:00.983
but this is a much better use
of the money.

09:01.023 --> 09:03.116
Is it okay if I write
and direct it?

09:03.159 --> 09:05.354
I write the flyer
for the feed store

09:05.394 --> 09:07.419
and always wanted to branch out.

09:07.463 --> 09:08.930
I read that flyer.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.660
That's a good flyer.

09:10.700 --> 09:11.997
Thanks. It's my baby.

09:12.034 --> 09:14.002
They don't pay me, but still,
it's a credit.

09:14.036 --> 09:15.264
But this reenactment...

09:15.304 --> 09:16.601
it could really be something

09:16.639 --> 09:18.573
that makes people sit up
and take notice.

09:18.608 --> 09:19.734
Let's do it.

09:19.775 --> 09:21.970
Hey, this calls for
a celebration.

09:22.011 --> 09:24.172
What kind of pie says heroism?

09:24.213 --> 09:25.237
Strawberry.

09:25.281 --> 09:26.475
Of course.

09:28.317 --> 09:30.217
Oh, stupid Texas history.

09:30.253 --> 09:33.552
I can't believe I'm going
to summer school.

09:33.589 --> 09:35.750
They don't even serve lunch...

09:35.791 --> 09:37.850
just raisins and skim milk.

09:37.893 --> 09:40.327
And they only
open one bathroom.

09:40.363 --> 09:42.729
I am sure you won't have
to go to summer school.

09:42.765 --> 09:44.357
No one really wants
to teach it.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.992
Just try to do
some extra credit.

09:46.035 --> 09:47.730
I have students hold doors
for me.

09:47.770 --> 09:49.499
Now, please put
your finger here

09:49.538 --> 09:51.472
so I can staple his groin
together.

09:51.507 --> 09:52.667
Bobby, Peggy,

09:52.708 --> 09:54.869
I just met a man named
Bruce Tuttle,

09:54.910 --> 09:57.606
and we're doing
a historical reenactment

09:57.647 --> 09:58.671
of the Alamo.

09:58.714 --> 09:59.840
A reenactment?

09:59.882 --> 10:02.214
Hey, that could be
my extra credit.

10:02.251 --> 10:03.718
Can I be in it?

10:03.753 --> 10:06.586
Well, Bruce did say a lot
of the soldiers were teenagers.

10:06.622 --> 10:09.523
I bet he could use someone
like you to keep it authentic.

10:09.558 --> 10:12.083
That's my specialty...
keeping it real.

10:12.128 --> 10:14.688
Authentic, Bobby, authentic.

10:16.165 --> 10:19.464
Yep. If the school won't teach
my boy Texas history

10:19.502 --> 10:20.969
this reenactment will.

10:21.003 --> 10:22.095
Can I help build
the set, Hank?

10:22.138 --> 10:23.696
It might make me feel better

10:23.739 --> 10:25.798
about falling asleep
in the men's room

10:25.841 --> 10:27.331
at the Alamo Imax movie.

10:27.376 --> 10:29.674
Yeah, man, count me in, man,
use my dang ol' bowie knife,

10:29.712 --> 10:30.974
man, talkin' 'bout dang ol'...

10:31.013 --> 10:32.503
"Victory or death."

10:32.548 --> 10:33.845
You can all help.

10:33.883 --> 10:36.408
We'll be an all-
volunteer crew...

10:36.452 --> 10:38.443
just like the real Alamo.

10:38.487 --> 10:40.011
Sirs, I bring news
from the front.

10:40.056 --> 10:43.048
You can get two
Just a burgers for 49 cents

10:43.092 --> 10:44.992
at Whataburger this week.

10:45.027 --> 10:46.221
I have 49 cents.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.723
The general also sends word...

10:51.767 --> 10:53.860
Ladybird's water bowl
is empty.

10:53.903 --> 10:56.599
Hank, Bobby's making me
uncomfortable again.

10:56.639 --> 10:57.663
Spank him.

10:57.707 --> 10:58.901
Shut up, Dale.

10:58.941 --> 11:01.307
Bobby's practicing for
the reenactment.

11:01.344 --> 11:02.971
Mr. Tuttle said
I can play

11:03.012 --> 11:05.480
James Butler Bonham,
Alamo messenger.

11:05.514 --> 11:08.347
And my teacher said
I can get extra credit

11:08.384 --> 11:09.908
to make up for my "F."

11:09.952 --> 11:11.317
That's great.

11:11.354 --> 11:13.322
You know, the messenger is
the first one to die.

11:13.356 --> 11:14.983
Messenger, bring word

11:15.024 --> 11:18.721
to my wife... we make
love on the 'morrow.

11:25.534 --> 11:26.762
Everything has to look

11:26.802 --> 11:28.463
as real as possible.

11:28.504 --> 11:29.835
We do this right,

11:29.872 --> 11:31.999
and more than just the eyes
of Arlen will be upon us.

11:32.041 --> 11:33.099
That's right.

11:33.142 --> 11:34.973
Kids from all over
Heimlich County

11:35.010 --> 11:36.238
are being bussed in.

11:36.278 --> 11:38.143
Even Durndle and East Rumpert.

11:38.180 --> 11:39.169
Ah, thanks, doll.

11:39.215 --> 11:40.341
Hey, everybody meet

11:40.383 --> 11:41.941
my baby-sitter,
Sharla.

11:41.984 --> 11:43.076
Hey, y'all.

11:43.119 --> 11:45.314
She's helping me out
with the actors.

11:45.354 --> 11:47.413
You just missed
a hell of a rehearsal.

11:47.456 --> 11:48.787
Leave it to Bruce to find

11:48.824 --> 11:51.315
the best hook-handed actor
in Heimlich County.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.351
What can I say?
I think of everything.

11:53.396 --> 11:55.159
So, Hank, how's
the set coming?

11:55.197 --> 11:57.222
Well, we've already cut
the design out

11:57.266 --> 11:59.029
of one-by and quarter inch
plywood.

11:59.068 --> 12:01.229
You sound like
a big Hollywood set designer.

12:01.270 --> 12:03.534
I guess that makes me a big
Hollywood director.

12:03.572 --> 12:04.539
Someday, eh?

12:04.573 --> 12:05.835
You know, I joke about

12:05.875 --> 12:08.503
running off to Hollywood
and abandoning my kids,

12:08.544 --> 12:11.411
but I don't think I could
really go through with it.

12:13.549 --> 12:15.414
Ah...

12:15.451 --> 12:18.079
I've got work to do.

12:22.224 --> 12:23.657
Nice and steady, guys.

12:29.765 --> 12:32.029
The Alamo looks
beautiful at dusk.

12:32.067 --> 12:33.295
Oh, yeah.

12:33.335 --> 12:35.997
If it were a painting
it would be called

12:36.038 --> 12:38.506
"Painting of Sun
Setting on Alamo."

12:38.541 --> 12:40.771
I'm gonna practice
my line, Dad.

12:40.810 --> 12:42.243
Okay, son.

12:42.278 --> 12:45.805
Sir, Santa Anna's men
outnumber us by the thousands.

12:45.848 --> 12:48.214
General Houston
sends his regards

12:48.250 --> 12:50.115
but no additional troops.

12:51.754 --> 12:53.745
Well, it looks like
the Mexican army

12:53.789 --> 12:55.757
is flying the flag
of No Quarter.

12:55.791 --> 12:57.884
Gentlemen,
how should we respond?

12:57.927 --> 13:00.452
On your order, I shall
load the cannon.

13:00.496 --> 13:03.397
Yeah, man, talkin'
'bout dang ol' kaboom, man.

13:05.935 --> 13:08.529
We will never surrender...

13:08.571 --> 13:09.868
or retreat...

13:09.905 --> 13:12.533
We sure won't, Dad.

13:15.044 --> 13:16.011
All right, then.

13:16.045 --> 13:17.512
That's it for tonight, guys.

13:17.546 --> 13:18.911
Tomorrow's the big day...

13:18.948 --> 13:21.212
a chance for everyone
to be at the Alamo.

13:21.250 --> 13:24.378
I'm so excited, I don't know
how I'm going to sleep.

13:24.420 --> 13:25.819
Better drink up.

13:29.592 --> 13:32.686
Well, I guess if it's
to teach the kids.

13:36.966 --> 13:38.297
Do we really have to worry

13:38.334 --> 13:40.598
about children wandering
into pork plants

13:40.636 --> 13:42.331
and climbing
onto the kill line?

13:42.371 --> 13:44.168
Not if I do my job.

13:49.011 --> 13:51.002
Hank, I just had an idea...

13:51.046 --> 13:53.640
well, it was more
of an inspiration.

13:53.682 --> 13:56.207
I want to open the play
with a speech

13:56.252 --> 13:59.483
from a new character...
"The Ghost of the Alamo."

13:59.522 --> 14:01.217
What do you think?

14:01.257 --> 14:02.281
Uh, ghost?

14:02.324 --> 14:03.924
Well, it's just a device
to set the stage

14:03.926 --> 14:05.553
to let people know how they
should feel

14:05.594 --> 14:06.788
about what they're watching.

14:06.829 --> 14:09.093
Huh. Sounds kind
of creative,

14:09.131 --> 14:11.326
but okay, you're the writer.

14:11.367 --> 14:12.459
And the director.

14:12.501 --> 14:13.763
Places.

14:13.802 --> 14:15.099
Finally.

14:15.137 --> 14:17.105
I can't wait to see it.

14:19.475 --> 14:22.137
I am the ghost of the Alamo.

14:22.177 --> 14:23.735
He's pretty spooky.

14:23.779 --> 14:26.475
They say to remember
the Alamo.

14:26.515 --> 14:28.380
Well, heed their call.

14:28.417 --> 14:31.875
The story is timeless,
a lesson to all.

14:31.921 --> 14:33.218
Where are our heroes?

14:33.255 --> 14:34.847
Don't look for them here.

14:34.890 --> 14:36.152
The world's not so simple.

14:36.191 --> 14:39.524
The world's not so clear.

14:39.562 --> 14:41.325
Uh... I don't get it.

14:43.499 --> 14:45.467
Davy Crockett. Thank God.

14:45.501 --> 14:48.368
It has become clear that
I will never make it back

14:48.404 --> 14:49.837
to my beloved Tennessee.

14:49.872 --> 14:51.100
If I were a stronger man

14:51.140 --> 14:52.903
I guess I wouldn't be here.

14:52.942 --> 14:55.103
I would have faced up
to my demons

14:55.144 --> 14:57.874
instead of using dead Indians
and Mexicans

14:57.913 --> 15:00.381
as stepping stones back
to the Senate.

15:00.416 --> 15:02.008
Vengeance is the Lord's

15:02.051 --> 15:04.611
and he has sent his army
to vanquish us

15:04.653 --> 15:06.177
for our transgressions.

15:06.221 --> 15:07.381
We're all damned.

15:07.423 --> 15:10.392
Don't go looking for
your opium, Davy.

15:10.426 --> 15:12.394
Travis smoked it all up.

15:12.428 --> 15:14.726
I gave half
to the prostitutes.

15:14.763 --> 15:15.855
What?!

15:15.898 --> 15:17.832
That's not part of the Alamo.

15:17.866 --> 15:19.094
Tell them to stop.

15:19.134 --> 15:20.362
No, this is right.

15:20.402 --> 15:22.597
Bruce moved the big
escape attempt

15:22.638 --> 15:24.629
to after
the bear baiting scene.

15:24.673 --> 15:25.640
What?

15:25.674 --> 15:27.073
Surrender or die?

15:27.109 --> 15:29.373
Why start being a hero now?

15:29.411 --> 15:32.005
General SantaAnna!

15:32.047 --> 15:34.072
General SantaAnna!

15:34.116 --> 15:35.708
I surrender.

15:35.751 --> 15:37.844
Oh, General!

15:41.724 --> 15:43.316
That was perfect!
Now once again from the top.

15:43.359 --> 15:46.419
We're angry, we're drunk,
we're slaveholders.

15:46.462 --> 15:47.429
And... action!

15:47.463 --> 15:48.521
No!

15:48.564 --> 15:50.225
Not action!

15:50.265 --> 15:52.699
What the hell
are you doing to our Alamo?

15:52.735 --> 15:55.636
: You've got William
B. Travis in a dress!

15:55.671 --> 15:58.231
Hank, it's a little late
to step in with your notes.

15:58.273 --> 15:59.763
The play starts in a half hour.

15:59.808 --> 16:02.003
You could have asked
for a script at any time.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.841
Why would I need
to read a script

16:03.879 --> 16:05.141
of the Alamo?

16:05.180 --> 16:07.648
I know what happened
and I know what didn't happen,

16:07.683 --> 16:10.311
and I know William B. Travis
didn't put on a dress

16:10.352 --> 16:11.819
and try to abandon his men.

16:11.854 --> 16:13.515
And how do you know that, Hank?

16:13.555 --> 16:14.783
How do you know

16:14.823 --> 16:16.586
that when the pressures became
too great,

16:16.625 --> 16:19.594
William B. Travis didn't try
to find comfort and safety

16:19.628 --> 16:20.993
in a frilly calico dress?

16:22.064 --> 16:24.055
That's it.
I'm gonna kick your ass.

16:24.099 --> 16:26.533
Then I'm gonna re-enact
kicking your ass.

16:26.568 --> 16:30.129
What were you expecting anyway,
the old John Wayne rehashing?

16:30.172 --> 16:31.002
Yes!

16:32.541 --> 16:34.475
What makes you think
that vision of the Alamo

16:34.510 --> 16:35.977
is any more valid than mine?

16:36.011 --> 16:38.844
Historians can't even agree how
many people were at the Alamo.

16:38.881 --> 16:41.179
Maybe Davy Crockett wasn't
on the pipe,

16:41.216 --> 16:43.207
but maybe he was.

16:43.252 --> 16:47.586
He was a failed politician
and a deeply troubled man.

16:47.623 --> 16:48.715
If Bruce is ever going

16:48.757 --> 16:50.122
to get his work
taken seriously

16:50.159 --> 16:51.558
by the people that matter,

16:51.593 --> 16:54.323
he needs to show them
he's got a new perspective.

16:54.363 --> 16:57.230
I think Oliver Stone and his
Oscars would agree with her.

16:57.266 --> 17:00.497
You know, people like you
and the guys at the feed store

17:00.536 --> 17:02.401
are always trying
to keep me down.

17:02.438 --> 17:03.962
Well, it's too late, baby.

17:07.209 --> 17:09.905
Son, turn in your outfit.
We're going home.

17:09.944 --> 17:13.073
Dad, I know this Alamo stuff
is important to you,

17:13.115 --> 17:16.550
but I don't want to get an "F"
and go to summer school.

17:16.585 --> 17:18.246
I have to do this.

17:23.726 --> 17:24.818
Damn revisionists!

17:24.859 --> 17:27.192
Why can't they ever make
history better...

17:27.229 --> 17:31.029
where we all live in Antarctica
and worship the Golden Penguin?

17:31.066 --> 17:33.091
That would be great.

17:35.003 --> 17:37.164
I surrender!
I surrender!

17:37.206 --> 17:38.264
I surrender!

17:38.307 --> 17:42.835
I surrender, I surrender,
I surrender!

17:42.878 --> 17:44.539
Well, I can't force
the schools to teach the Alamo,

17:44.580 --> 17:47.606
but maybe I can still stop
this travesty.

17:47.649 --> 17:51.415
Are you talking
sabotage, Hank?

17:51.453 --> 17:55.116
'Cause if you say sabotage,
I'll say "how high?"

17:57.526 --> 17:58.686
Let's do it.

18:05.868 --> 18:07.733
All right, it's ten minutes
to curtain.

18:07.770 --> 18:10.534
That doesn't give us much time,
but we built this set,

18:10.572 --> 18:12.130
so we should know how
to wreck it.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.472
I should've paid
more attention.

18:14.510 --> 18:17.638
Well, my sledge hammer'll
figure it out for me.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.147
This'll shut Tuttle up.

18:20.182 --> 18:23.208
They're all trapped inside there
like the Alamo volunteers

18:23.252 --> 18:26.085
and we're out here ready
to take care of business

18:26.121 --> 18:28.555
like General Santa Anna!

18:32.194 --> 18:36.153
It's not like we're gonna kill
people! Just ideas!

18:37.232 --> 18:38.665
We can't shut this thing down

18:38.700 --> 18:41.066
just because we don't like
what they're saying.

18:41.103 --> 18:43.833
I feel the fun slowing down.

18:46.008 --> 18:48.408
Hank, what are you doing
with those sledgehammers?

18:48.443 --> 18:49.432
Oh, I get it.

18:49.478 --> 18:51.571
Well, you can't censor me!

18:51.613 --> 18:54.047
I'm not going
to stop your show, Bruce.

18:54.082 --> 18:56.209
I'm just going
to "set the stage."

19:01.890 --> 19:04.723
I know there are a lot
of details in history

19:04.760 --> 19:06.250
that are up for grabs;

19:06.295 --> 19:10.197
like what Jim Bowie was thinking
about right before he died,

19:10.232 --> 19:12.166
or whether Davy Crockett
surrendered.

19:12.201 --> 19:14.499
But these are
the undisputed facts:

19:14.536 --> 19:18.028
In March of 1836,
nearly 200 men volunteered

19:18.073 --> 19:20.507
so that Texas could become
a republic.

19:20.542 --> 19:22.442
Even though they were
under-trained,

19:22.477 --> 19:25.139
outnumbered and completely
surrounded,

19:25.180 --> 19:27.671
they fought on and died
for what they believed in.

19:28.917 --> 19:31.385
And I've always found that
inspiring.

19:38.927 --> 19:40.986
Is that a messenger
bringing news

19:41.029 --> 19:42.462
from General Houston?

19:42.497 --> 19:45.955
Sir, Santa Anna's men
outnumber us by the thousands.

19:53.108 --> 19:56.737
If this siege continues,
I may have to surrender sober.

19:57.946 --> 19:59.038
Hey, Dad,

19:59.081 --> 20:02.642
you're gonna have
to sign this.

20:02.684 --> 20:04.413
I failed Texas history.

20:04.453 --> 20:08.082
What? After going through
with that jackass play?

20:08.123 --> 20:10.523
Yeah, but I wrote in my book.

20:10.559 --> 20:12.424
It's an automatic "F."

20:12.461 --> 20:13.928
Oh, Bobby.

20:13.962 --> 20:21.027
"The Alamo. In March of
1836, nearly 200 men..."

20:21.069 --> 20:22.661
I wanted to make sure

20:22.704 --> 20:25.639
kids after me
knew about the Alamo.

20:27.075 --> 20:29.771
You know, since you're going
to summer school anyway,

20:29.811 --> 20:31.745
why don't you skip class
tomorrow?

20:31.780 --> 20:33.338
I'll take you to Six Flags.

20:34.750 --> 20:37.150
It's called Six Flags
Over Texas

20:37.185 --> 20:41.849
because Texas was governed by six
different sovereign nations.

20:41.890 --> 20:45.291
There's Texas, America...
Mexico, France...

20:45.327 --> 20:48.587
I don't know how
France got in there.

21:02.443 --> 21:06.203
I think this will be the last
year we do Flat Stanley.

21:13.689 --> 21:19.149

uncomfortable again.</i>
