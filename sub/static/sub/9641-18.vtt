00:17.277 --> 00:20.153
Ugh. What's the alien
word for "soup"?

00:20.188 --> 00:21.625
Oh, soup? Uh...

00:27.711 --> 00:30.348
For aliens, soup is a really
complicated concept.

00:30.383 --> 00:32.788
It's a food that
you drink and chew.

00:33.625 --> 00:35.729
Which is crazy. Crazy.

00:42.445 --> 00:45.649
Can yoplease tell me what the
point of Alien Language League is?

00:45.683 --> 00:49.388
It's like, if aliens come to
Earth, they should just speak Earth.

00:50.958 --> 00:53.629
Alex, clubs provide
a positive environment

00:53.663 --> 00:55.231
for people with
like interests.

00:55.266 --> 00:57.367
Which is why I joined
Alien Language League.

00:58.537 --> 01:00.005
You don't like
alien language.

01:00.540 --> 01:01.974
Nope.

01:02.008 --> 01:03.476
But I like Zeke.

Uh-uh! No.

01:14.229 --> 01:16.867
Hey, you wanna-be-aliens
leave my friend alone.

01:16.901 --> 01:19.338
She's the only one who sees
through me and sticks around.

01:20.675 --> 01:23.144
Relax, Alex. I'm just
helping them plan their banquet.

01:24.546 --> 01:26.881
Why do people make such big
deals out of banquets?

01:26.915 --> 01:29.284
It's like,
"Hey, let's all sit around

01:29.319 --> 01:32.322
and listen to stupid speeches while
we all eat the same exact meal."

01:33.825 --> 01:35.593
I like eating the same
as everyone else.

01:35.627 --> 01:38.429
That way I never feel bad
about ordering wrong.

01:41.870 --> 01:44.873
Well, I mean, I'd be okay with it
if we all ate my favorite meal.

01:44.907 --> 01:46.575
Biscuits and loose corn.

01:47.244 --> 01:49.012
Loose corn?

01:49.046 --> 01:52.416
[scoffs] It's just called corn.

01:54.086 --> 01:57.222
I like it cut off the cob.
Cobs are too heavy.

01:57.256 --> 02:00.326
Eighty percent of the weight you're
picking up you're not even eating.

02:01.562 --> 02:03.631
Okay, every year the Alien
Language League hands out

02:03.665 --> 02:06.301
the Lifetime Achievement Award
to a graduating senior.

02:06.368 --> 02:09.603
And I have it on good authority
that I have it in the bag.

02:09.637 --> 02:12.273
This year it really will
be the best year ever...

02:12.307 --> 02:13.642
...for me!

02:14.911 --> 02:17.279
Plus, we got Joey
"The Crepe Kid," coming in.

02:17.313 --> 02:19.048
He's the youngest
crepe chef in the city.

02:19.082 --> 02:21.951
He makes crepes from all around
the world. It's gonna be...

02:21.986 --> 02:23.119
...crepe-tacular.

02:24.555 --> 02:27.726
You know, Zeke. You are so
cute when you're easily excited.

02:27.760 --> 02:30.195
But I'm always easily excited.

02:30.229 --> 02:31.630
I know.

02:38.106 --> 02:41.575
And guys, guess what? The banquet
is gonna be here in the Sub Shop,

02:41.610 --> 02:43.645
so the whole family can come.

02:43.679 --> 02:47.048
Mm-hmm, yeah. I don't need to
know when it is, because I'm busy.

02:47.082 --> 02:51.052
No, because I checked your calendar and
you've got no plans for the next 30 years.

02:52.588 --> 02:54.156
Ha. I don't have a calendar.

02:54.190 --> 02:57.426
Ha! People who don't have
calendars also don't have plans.

02:57.460 --> 03:00.395
Owned! So hard!
Owned!

03:03.834 --> 03:05.702
Yeah, sometimes he wins.

Hey, you're grouchy.

04:36.292 --> 04:39.159
Your hands smell
like delicious chocolate.

04:42.163 --> 04:44.631
Dad, pocket elves can't fly.

04:47.401 --> 04:48.868
Oops.

04:49.970 --> 04:52.538
Alex, how many times
do I have to tell you

04:52.572 --> 04:54.440
to keep the portal door closed?!

04:55.341 --> 04:56.909
At least one more?

04:58.511 --> 05:01.913
We can't have Wizard World creatures
drifting in here all the time.

05:01.947 --> 05:04.515
It gets so stuy in here.

05:04.549 --> 05:07.217
Mostly because our lair
is inside a produce locker

05:07.251 --> 05:11.387
where you don't throw out vegetables
until they start growg other vegetables.

05:11.421 --> 05:14.656
Hey, we haven't paid for
mushrooms in over ten years.

05:19.461 --> 05:21.328
You see!
You let a wizard bug in.

05:22.130 --> 05:23.897
- Get the door!
- Get...

05:26.801 --> 05:27.867
What...?!

05:33.739 --> 05:36.607
Oh! I need a bigger broom.
One that stays together.

05:38.843 --> 05:39.842
Where'd it go?

05:41.378 --> 05:43.478
Dad. Don't move.
It's on your back.

05:46.081 --> 05:48.048
Come on, get it!
Oh, not with that!

05:48.083 --> 05:49.750
You're gonna kill
the bug and me!

05:51.753 --> 05:53.753
Ow! It bit me!

05:56.690 --> 05:58.190
It's dead.

06:01.293 --> 06:04.128
Now it's a stain.
[chuckles]

06:06.364 --> 06:08.465
Oh, it really hurts.

06:08.500 --> 06:09.800
Did it leave a mark?

06:14.205 --> 06:17.206
Oh... no.
You can't even see i

06:17.241 --> 06:18.641
I'll go get
my magnifying glass,

06:18.675 --> 06:20.742
'cause I, I don't even
know where the bite is.

06:46.365 --> 06:48.365
You ve a popcorn machine
in your locker?

06:48.400 --> 06:51.101
- Where do you keep your books?
- In your locker.

06:52.703 --> 06:55.004
I have a locker?
You said only girls get them.

07:07.649 --> 07:11.018

for we come in peace.

07:11.052 --> 07:14.154
[alien aent] Ahh. We have traveled
the far reaches of the galaxy

07:14.188 --> 07:16.556
to deliver you
a special message.

07:16.590 --> 07:18.057
- Special.
- Oh!

07:20.994 --> 07:24.396
[alien accent] Tonight all members of
the Alien Language League are required

07:24.430 --> 07:27.098
to report to a secret
last minute location...

07:28.900 --> 07:31.033

07:40.808 --> 07:42.842
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

07:42.877 --> 07:44.944
- All right!
- Joey!

07:44.978 --> 07:47.512
- That went well.
- Yes, it did. [clears throat]

07:47.547 --> 07:51.616
[normal voice] Well... We now return
you to your regularly scheduled classes.

07:51.650 --> 07:52.817
All right.

07:53.686 --> 07:55.453
Thank you, you're great.

07:55.487 --> 07:59.623
Hey, guys. If Joey The Crepe Kid
is in, MacGruder is in.

07:59.657 --> 08:02.558
This totally tops
the Math Club's taco bar.

08:02.592 --> 08:05.060
- Yeah. Tacos are gross.
- Yes! Math? Losers.

08:05.094 --> 08:06.863
What's a taco?

08:08.532 --> 08:11.434
Alex, all these alien theatrics
have given me an idea.

08:12.569 --> 08:14.636
I'm going totart
an alien language club.

08:16.837 --> 08:19.372
That's what this is.
Alien Language League.

08:19.406 --> 08:21.907
Don't tell them what I'm doing
or they're gonna copy me.

08:23.210 --> 08:25.077
They're already doing it.

08:25.111 --> 08:26.911
Not if I do it first.

08:28.213 --> 08:29.780
May the best club win.

08:33.017 --> 08:34.418
You are a delight.

08:36.154 --> 08:37.821
Zeke, that was great!

08:37.855 --> 08:39.389
I'm so glad we kept
that smoke machine

08:39.424 --> 08:41.091
from our failed
DJ business.

08:41.126 --> 08:44.727
I still think
ZJ the DJs can work.

08:44.762 --> 08:46.729
Wikki-wikki. Me, too.

08:48.798 --> 08:51.867
Dude! You think I can use it when I
accept my Lifetime Achievement Award?

08:51.901 --> 08:56.103
Right on. You, sir, are my
bro-dre from another mo-dre.

09:01.942 --> 09:05.344
You cannot tell that you're still
into Zeke after that nerd circus.

09:21.758 --> 09:23.892
Uh... Excuse me,

09:23.927 --> 09:26.127
Joey The Crepe Kid,
where is your sign?

09:26.161 --> 09:28.629
When people walk into places
they like big signs

09:28.664 --> 09:30.364
tell them
what's going on.

09:30.399 --> 09:34.668
Nah. I think it's pretty
self-explanatory, Mrs. Russo,

09:34.703 --> 09:36.470
When people walk up
my crepe station

09:36.538 --> 09:38.572
and see what's going on.
I'm just sayin'.

09:38.607 --> 09:40.207
You know. [clicks]

09:40.242 --> 09:43.377
Are you setting up here some
sort of pumpkin carving booth?

09:46.048 --> 09:48.181
We need a sign. Just sayin'.

09:50.317 --> 09:53.252
Hey, Mom. I'm having my new
Alien Language Club over later.

09:53.287 --> 09:57.657
Max, honey, we're having a
banquet for Alien Language League.

09:57.691 --> 10:00.660
Nice! Thank you
for your support.

10:02.362 --> 10:05.164
Hey, Joey, lookin' good.

10:05.198 --> 10:06.899
Lookin' good.

10:06.934 --> 10:08.967
You, uh, you need a hand,
you know, chef to chef?

10:09.002 --> 10:11.335
- Where's the other chef?
- Hey, come on.

10:14.538 --> 10:16.239
What's wrong with your hand?

10:16.273 --> 10:18.140
[stammers] Uh, nothing.

10:18.174 --> 10:20.376
Nothing's wrong. I just
have a skin condition

10:20.410 --> 10:23.211
that flares up every
once in a while and, um...

10:23.245 --> 10:25.747
- I don't moisturize enough.
- Moisturize.

10:27.516 --> 10:30.083
Dad, you're turning
into a bug.

10:30.118 --> 10:33.119
I know. I think it's because
I got bit by a wizard bug

10:33.153 --> 10:35.521
when Alex left
the portal door open.

10:35.555 --> 10:38.123
You're gonna lose control
and run around all crazy.

10:38.157 --> 10:40.658
You've seen what the bugs do
when you turn the lights on.

10:40.693 --> 10:42.527
They lose control and
run around all crazy.

10:42.561 --> 10:45.530
I'm just gonna find something
to cover my hand with.

10:45.564 --> 10:49.000
With what?! They don't
make roach mittens!

10:51.036 --> 10:53.804
I'm sure it'll be fine. He'll
be back to normal in no time.

10:58.109 --> 11:00.277
What? Oh!

11:00.311 --> 11:02.512
This place is disgusting.

11:02.547 --> 11:04.848
That's the biggest
bug I ever seen.

11:04.882 --> 11:08.583
- [Jerry gasping]
- [Joey whistles] Get the car goin'!

11:14.264 --> 11:16.665
Jerry, are you in here?

11:18.668 --> 11:20.635
Bright lights! [shouts]

11:25.707 --> 11:26.807
My husba's a bug.

11:26.841 --> 11:28.509
I should have married
Marty Stoller.

11:28.543 --> 11:29.943
I'd be a dentist's wife.

11:31.379 --> 11:33.613
First we lose Joey
The Crepe Kid and now this?

11:33.647 --> 11:37.449
This is not the proper atmosphere in which
to receive the Lifetime Achievement Award.

11:40.119 --> 11:42.353
Dad's a bug? I get
to flick him first!

11:47.526 --> 11:48.760
I'm so sorry, Justin.

11:48.794 --> 11:50.061
But we can't
have people here

11:50.095 --> 11:52.462
while your Dad is
flitting around like crazy.

11:52.497 --> 11:54.264
Even if we try to lock him up,

11:54.298 --> 11:56.132
he'll eat his way
through the door.

11:56.166 --> 11:59.535
He already can eat his way through
take-out containers with human teeth.

12:01.204 --> 12:02.838
We're gonna have
to cancel the banquet.

12:02.872 --> 12:04.339
[scoffs] Not my banquet!

12:04.373 --> 12:06.408
LookSome confusing
stuff's going on.

12:06.443 --> 12:08.244
We all need to make
some sacrifices.

12:09.112 --> 12:10.779
Say we cancel Justin's banquet.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.613
Mine will go on.

12:16.015 --> 12:18.649
We are not cancelling
the banquet.

12:18.684 --> 12:20.918
Come on.
We're the Russos.

12:20.952 --> 12:24.521
We can't let something small
like Dad turning into

12:24.555 --> 12:26.389
a life-sized,
disgusting roach

12:26.423 --> 12:30.458
ruin Justin's senior year
moment. We are the Russos!

12:32.394 --> 12:35.596
- No matter how many times you say "We are
the Russos... - [whispers] Ware the Russos.

12:35.630 --> 12:38.566
...you can't hide the fact this is
another of my senior year moments

12:38.601 --> 12:41.335
- that you wanna see wrecked.
- [whispers] We're the Russos.

12:41.936 --> 12:43.203
Unlike you,

12:43.237 --> 12:45.137
I'm only going to have
one seni year moment,

12:45.172 --> 12:47.441
so I'm trying to get this
one ght. Don't say it!

12:48.777 --> 12:50.411
And I am gonna make sure

12:50.446 --> 12:53.248
that you get your
senior year moment, Justin.

12:53.282 --> 12:55.516
This is just a little bug bite.

12:55.551 --> 12:57.451
I'm sure I can
control myself.

12:59.187 --> 13:01.421
Dad! I don't know how many times
I'm gonna tell you,

13:01.455 --> 13:04.724
it's not a bite.
You're a dirty, nasty bug.

13:04.758 --> 13:08.227
Hey! That is no way to talk
to your exoskeleton father!

13:10.031 --> 13:12.865
Okay, I don't know what we're gonna
do, 'cause these things last da.

13:12.899 --> 13:15.134
Hey! I still have my face.

13:17.805 --> 13:20.706
Uh, here's an idea, I'll just
throw on an overcoat and a top hat

13:20.741 --> 13:22.842
and I'll, I'll just...
blend right in.

13:24.211 --> 13:26.779
Jerry, you're not
gonna blend right in.

13:26.813 --> 13:30.749
You need to stay up in the lof
until thishing runs its course.

13:30.783 --> 13:33.150
Great. Are we voting?

13:33.185 --> 13:36.053
'Cause I like the idea of the top
hat and overcoat. Who's with me?

13:36.854 --> 13:39.222
Okay, okay. I'll stay upstairs.

13:39.257 --> 13:42.993
If someone tapes a spatula
to mclaw,

13:43.027 --> 13:45.529
and someone else catches
the goo falling from my face,

13:45.563 --> 13:47.597
I'm pretty sure
I can make the crepes.

13:50.635 --> 13:52.302
Dibs on catching the goo.

13:54.772 --> 13:57.341
Thank you so much for coming to
my club. It really means a lot.

13:57.375 --> 14:00.110
Thank you for joining. Always
a pleasure to see you, buddy!

14:00.144 --> 14:01.911
Ha-ha! Thank you for coming.

14:01.945 --> 14:04.013
Thank you so much
for joining my club.

14:04.014 --> 14:07.216
Wow. Look how many people
showed up for my club.

14:07.250 --> 14:08.716
It's very humbling.

14:15.722 --> 14:19.358
- [mouths] Little. Louder. - Excuse
me, can I have your attention please?

14:19.392 --> 14:22.160
[clears throat] Excuse me,

14:22.195 --> 14:24.595
if you could please just...
If your attention...

14:24.630 --> 14:27.598
Could you just focus...
on me foa second?

14:27.632 --> 14:28.932
That would be good.

14:29.968 --> 14:31.368
I think I can help.

14:33.838 --> 14:36.506
Listen up, people!

14:36.540 --> 14:38.907
I know where all
of you live, so...

14:38.941 --> 14:42.009
or I'll make a guest appearance in
each and every one of your nightmares!

14:45.113 --> 14:46.880
Have aice banquet!

14:48.449 --> 14:52.485
Okay, welcome to this year's
Alien Language League banquet.

14:57.024 --> 14:59.825
- [Zeke] Great.
- Where isoey The Crepe Kid?

14:59.859 --> 15:01.159
His crepes are the only reon

15:01.194 --> 15:05.428
I spent $50 on an Alien
Language dictionary.

15:05.462 --> 15:08.363
We have something even better
than Joey The Crepe Kid.

15:08.398 --> 15:09.832
Why don't you sit on down?

15:09.866 --> 15:11.666
Go check on the crepes.

15:11.701 --> 15:13.535
My banquet,
my problem.

15:15.604 --> 15:18.773
In the meantime,
our sci-fi movie scene players

15:18.807 --> 15:20.240
are gonna come up and perform

15:20.275 --> 15:21.641
one of the greatest

15:21.675 --> 15:25.678
alien sces of all time,

15:25.712 --> 15:28.513
E.T. Raids the Refrigerator.

15:28.548 --> 15:30.715
- [gasps] Huh? Oh, man.
- [crowd murmurs]

15:30.749 --> 15:32.884
- Come on.
- Oh, man, exciting.

15:36.121 --> 15:38.489
Okay, here's the last
batch of crepes.

15:38.523 --> 15:40.123
Oh, there you go.

15:40.158 --> 15:42.659
Yosee what we can do
when we work together?

15:42.693 --> 15:45.995
Yeah. See what I can do while you
yell, "Faster, faster, faster!"

15:46.997 --> 15:48.730
Look, somebody has to be
the yeller.

15:50.533 --> 15:53.935
Guys, are my crepes ready yet? My
club meers are getting... [gasps

15:55.505 --> 15:58.606
Jerry, please don't tell me
you just ate all the crepes?!

16:01.410 --> 16:03.077
I vomited acid all over them,

16:03.112 --> 16:05.912
and when they liquefied
I slurped them up.

16:07.248 --> 16:09.949
Yeah, that's pretty much
how you normally eat.

16:11.517 --> 16:13.751
I don't think this is gonna
fly with my club mbers.

16:13.785 --> 16:16.020
They made it obvious
they're expecting crepes.

16:16.054 --> 16:19.789
Well, was expecting this whole thing
to blow up down there, not up here.

16:21.424 --> 16:24.092
This is kind of taking
all the fun t of it, though.

16:24.126 --> 16:25.260
I guess I'll help.

16:29.398 --> 16:32.599
I'll be right here.

16:36.436 --> 16:39.638
Good by... E.T]

16:43.509 --> 16:44.776
[both] And scene.

16:49.947 --> 16:52.215
Yeah, okay.
Wacka-wacka whatever.

16:52.250 --> 16:57.053
All right, bravo. This is
a great banquet so far, huh?

16:57.088 --> 17:00.222
All right, why don't we just get right
to the Lifetime Achievement Award?

17:00.256 --> 17:03.491
Wait, we're supposed to eat first.
Okay, where are those crepes?

17:03.525 --> 17:05.592
When I say "crepes,"
you say "Oop-blopp!"

17:05.627 --> 17:07.961
- Crepes! Crepes!
- Oop-blopp. Oop-blopp.

17:07.994 --> 17:11.732
Look! Unless you'll settle for some
tortillas and some powdered sugar,

17:11.766 --> 17:15.268
- you're not getting any crepe
- [all groaning]

17:15.301 --> 17:17.970
Instead, we are having

17:18.005 --> 17:20.271
biscuits and lose corn.

17:22.540 --> 17:23.941
What's going on?

17:23.974 --> 17:25.509
Dad ate all the crepes.

17:25.542 --> 17:27.710
[whispers] No. I mean,
why are you helping me?

17:29.046 --> 17:31.347
Well, first of a,
this is an opportunity

17:31.381 --> 17:33.682
for me to get some
scuitsnd loose corn.

17:37.186 --> 17:39.520
- No, there was just one reason.
- Good.

17:39.554 --> 17:42.622
So, biscuits, loose corn,
and this lame entertainment?

17:42.656 --> 17:45.991
This is the worst banquet ever.

17:46.025 --> 17:48.426
I'm hungry and am angry.

17:49.495 --> 17:50.962
I'm "hangry."

17:52.264 --> 17:54.032
No, no, no!
Wait. Don't leave.

17:54.066 --> 17:55.500
Forget it, Alex.
It's over.

17:55.534 --> 17:57.368
I'm not gonna get
my Lifetime Achievent Award.

17:57.402 --> 17:58.702
Thanks a lot

17:58.737 --> 18:02.738
Look, besidethe fact that
every guy in here cares more

18:02.773 --> 18:04.807
about having crepes
than having girlfriends,

18:04.841 --> 18:07.542
this is the wrong version
offending badly I had in mind.

18:07.576 --> 18:10.678
If I'm not gonna get my way, at
least you should get your way.

18:10.712 --> 18:13.014
- Harper. [clicks tongue]
- Hey!

18:13.749 --> 18:22.090
Everybody sit down now!

18:24.760 --> 18:26.593
Oh. Wow. Now I've got
to think of something.

18:35.968 --> 18:39.304
Okay, everyone. We have
a very special guest.

18:39.339 --> 18:41.540
Thank you for that
warm introduction, Alex.

18:41.574 --> 18:43.408
Not you.
[mouths] Sit dow

18:45.411 --> 18:47.412
We can't do this.
Dad's a wizard bug.

18:47.447 --> 18:48.613
No, no, no! It's okay.

18:48.900 --> 18:52.016
We'll show people something completely
crazy and they try to make sense of it.

18:54.285 --> 18:57.719
Hey, everybody! It's an alien
from the Guaga galaxy!

18:59.587 --> 19:00.621
Like that.

19:01.557 --> 19:02.523
Great costum

19:02.558 --> 19:04.058
What did you make
the face goo out of?

19:04.093 --> 19:06.760
Oh, don't tell me. I don't
want to spoil the illusion.

19:08.663 --> 19:11.164
And, and he came in peace.

19:11.199 --> 19:13.400
- Oh!
- Of course he did.

19:13.434 --> 19:16.269
The inhabitants of the Guaga
galaxy have been non-vaulent

19:16.303 --> 19:18.537
since the females moved
to the southern hemisphere.

19:18.571 --> 19:20.239
Yeah.

19:20.273 --> 19:23.375
- And he came to entertain you.
- Oh!

19:23.409 --> 19:24.743
With impressions.

19:24.777 --> 19:27.145
The Guagians are
amazing at impressions.

19:28.280 --> 19:30.281
I'm not good
at impressions.

19:30.315 --> 19:33.683
Say anything. They're nerds. They don't
want to admit they don't get something.

19:34.652 --> 19:36.919
Ahh, ahh...

19:36.953 --> 19:38.220
How do you, everybody?

19:38.254 --> 19:39.688
It's Woody, from Toy Story!

19:41.191 --> 19:43.291
Look at the viscosity
of his face acid.

19:43.326 --> 19:45.293
That what happens
to the Guagians

19:45.327 --> 19:47.095
in Earth's
extreme temperatures.

19:47.129 --> 19:49.097
Yeah, that's exactly
right, Zeke.

19:49.131 --> 19:50.297
Notice, everyone notice,

19:50.332 --> 19:53.166
his authentic spatula claw.

19:54.868 --> 19:56.869
[whispers] Why didn't you
remove his spatula claw?

19:56.903 --> 19:59.271
Yeah, no, that's not
just any spatula.

19:59.305 --> 20:01.539
That's an intergalactic spatula.

20:03.975 --> 20:06.600
I can't believe
they're buying this.

20:07.612 --> 20:09.847
- They are your people.
- Yeah.

20:12.452 --> 20:15.787
First, I'd like to apologize
for the la of crepes.

20:15.821 --> 20:19.690
I was hungry from my long
journey and I culdn't help myself.

20:22.060 --> 20:24.161
Okay. So, without further ado,

20:24.195 --> 20:26.200
I would like to
present this year's

20:26.300 --> 20:28.800
alien language league,
Lifetime Achievement Award,

20:28.899 --> 20:31.000
to someone who
was smart enough

20:31.034 --> 20:34.200
to get in contact to my people
and have me to here tonight:

20:35.305 --> 20:36.738
Justin Russo!

20:43.613 --> 20:46.114
- Thank you so much.
- Justin Russo?

20:46.149 --> 20:47.749
I was robbed!

21:02.363 --> 21:06.033
Wow! What a way to go
out in my senior year.

21:06.067 --> 21:07.767
I totally wasn't
expecting is.

21:07.801 --> 21:08.834
I mean, really.

21:08.869 --> 21:10.102
I absolutely wasn't.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.738
[exhales] I guess I'd
just like to say thank you

21:13.772 --> 21:16.006
to each and every one of
you that voted for me.

21:16.007 --> 21:17.907
And to those of
you that didn't...

21:20.677 --> 21:23.011
I really would like
to send a shout out

21:24.013 --> 21:25.380
right up there to my sister

21:25.414 --> 21:27.882
for making this truly, truly

21:27.883 --> 21:31.886
the most memorable senior
year moment that...

21:31.920 --> 21:33.087
...I'll ever have.

21:35.656 --> 21:37.591
And please don't
let me have another.

21:47.287 --> 21:50.956
Okay, round two of
biscuits and loose corn.

21:50.990 --> 21:53.291
- Hey, where did everybody go?
- Uh-uh. That's for me.

21:53.326 --> 21:56.461
Here, set it down. Go get me Dad's
big spoon. I can't get enough of this.

21:57.997 --> 21:59.530
I don't care
about the food.

21:59.565 --> 22:02.166
- I'm just happy that I got my trophy.
- [sloshing sounds]

22:03.702 --> 22:05.535
[belches] Uh-oh.

22:06.237 --> 22:07.669
Dad!

22:07.704 --> 22:09.304
You melted my trophy!

22:10.072 --> 22:11.339
[stammers] I was just

22:11.374 --> 22:13.100
trying to read the engraving.
