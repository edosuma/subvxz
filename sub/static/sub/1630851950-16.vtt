13:33.446 --> 13:37.081
- And yes, I do.
I know the number.

13:37.184 --> 13:42.487
- Okay, just press this,
this, this, and the number.

13:44.491 --> 13:48.393
- Okay. Thank you.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.061
- Sure.

13:50.163 --> 13:53.364
- Just, uh, this, this,
and this, right?

13:53.466 --> 13:58.703
- Yeah.
- Okay. Thank you.

13:58.805 --> 14:01.306
I'm gonna go
have some privacy.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.041
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:17.224 --> 14:20.859
- You know, you two sound
like a married couple.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.493
- Shut up.

14:22.596 --> 14:24.662
- Just saying.
- Don't say nothing.

14:24.764 --> 14:27.065
Alright?
Just don't say nothing.

14:27.167 --> 14:32.503
- Okay, yeah.
But you know she's

14:32.606 --> 14:34.405
not calling a lawyer.

14:34.507 --> 14:37.075
- I know that.
- Right.

14:37.177 --> 14:40.578
You know she's calling him
then, right?

14:40.680 --> 14:43.014
- Yes.
- MAX: Right. Just trying to...

14:43.116 --> 14:46.084
- I do.
- Okay. Can you trace her?

14:46.186 --> 14:47.485
- No.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.754
- No, right.
'Cause you're sure?

14:49.856 --> 14:53.291
I mean, Yeah.
Right.

14:53.393 --> 14:57.462
- Look, I think she's gonna
call a lawyer after him.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.063
- And you really think
you know her, right?

14:59.165 --> 15:00.832
- You can't just,
can you just...

15:00.934 --> 15:05.303
- I'm just saying.
It kind of affects me too.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.038
- Please, just go
back over there.

15:07.140 --> 15:10.108
- Carry on with your
delicious breakfast.

15:13.513 --> 15:19.284
- [phone buzzing]

15:24.991 --> 15:29.661
- Kyle.
- No, it's your other lover.

15:29.763 --> 15:33.264
- Oh, hey lover.

15:33.366 --> 15:34.699
- Hi.

15:34.801 --> 15:36.801
- Where are you?
I want to come and hug you.

15:36.903 --> 15:38.536
Hmm?

15:38.638 --> 15:39.938
- I bet you do.

15:40.040 --> 15:45.543
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, you thirsty? [laughs]

15:45.645 --> 15:50.481
- Yeah, but not the kind
of thirst you think.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.850
- Oh, you with your
big Trojan man, huh?

15:52.953 --> 15:58.389
- Mm-hm.
Yes, I am.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.224
- That's good.
- Yeah.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.827
And if he was into you,
you might enjoy him.

16:02.929 --> 16:06.864
- Ah, well, baby, I hate
to tell you, but I hit that.

16:06.967 --> 16:09.467
- Mm hmm.
Whatever.

16:09.569 --> 16:12.403
- Yeah.
You don't believe me?

16:12.505 --> 16:14.038
- I don't care what you say.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.741
- Okay.
You don't believe photos.

16:16.843 --> 16:18.409
You don't believe your own eyes.

16:18.511 --> 16:22.046
- Look, I'm calling to tell you
that you will be served.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.349
- Okay. Well, hey,
thanks for telling me.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.651
- Yeah, this is over.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.820
- Yeah.
You know, I kind of figured when

16:28.922 --> 16:31.489
um, I had you tortured that,
you know, you'd be all

16:31.591 --> 16:34.559
up in arms about it.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.527
- And I wanted to tell you
something else.

16:36.629 --> 16:38.463
- Okay.

16:38.565 --> 16:42.166
- I'm going to kill you.

16:42.268 --> 16:44.068
- Ah, is that so?

16:44.170 --> 16:48.106
- Mm hmm.
It's gonna be me.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.241
- Well, I look forward to it.

16:50.343 --> 16:54.512
- Yeah, this turnabout
is fair play, right?

16:54.614 --> 16:57.248
- Yes.
Yes, it is.

16:57.350 --> 17:00.251
- Well, you better beef up
your security, baby.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.020
- I already have, baby.

17:02.122 --> 17:03.554
- Yeah.
Because we see how easily

17:03.656 --> 17:06.357
he got through
your last detail.

17:06.459 --> 17:10.328
- Girl, look at you all
enamored over this fool.

17:10.430 --> 17:11.796
It's cute.

17:11.898 --> 17:15.733
- With him?
Yes, I am.

17:15.835 --> 17:21.706
Because I am being --
like I have never

17:21.808 --> 17:24.042
had a man
in my life.

17:29.315 --> 17:31.416
- I see.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.317
- Yeah.

17:33.420 --> 17:38.322
- Well, I look forward
to our showdown.

17:38.425 --> 17:42.693
- Mhm.
Not as much as I.

17:42.796 --> 17:45.763
- Mm hmm.
Good.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.532
- Good.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.033
- Goodbye.

17:49.135 --> 17:51.602
- Goodbye.
- I'll see you soon.

17:51.704 --> 17:55.506
- Mm, I'll count on it.

17:55.608 --> 17:57.075
- Oh, hey.

17:57.177 --> 18:01.813
- Yeah?
- Do you have Kyle?

18:01.915 --> 18:05.650
- Yeah, I do.

18:05.752 --> 18:09.220
- Is he there?
Can I speak with him?

18:09.322 --> 18:13.224
- No, he can't talk right now.
He's thirsty.

18:13.326 --> 18:17.662
- [laughs] I see you, Lilly.
I see you.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.397
It's a good one.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.402
Damn.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.070
Ah!

18:31.811 --> 18:33.244
Hey, Allan, I've been
calling you.

18:33.346 --> 18:35.713
I need you to call me back.
You call me back right now.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.014
You hear me?

18:39.486 --> 18:41.152
Shit.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.724
- What are you doing back here?

18:46.826 --> 18:50.061
- I've got a country to run.

18:50.163 --> 18:52.964
- What happened?
- What do you mean?

18:53.066 --> 18:54.632
- They replaced the young,
sexy nurses with

18:54.734 --> 18:57.034
some older ones?

18:57.137 --> 18:59.670
- Uh, I was there for my son.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.539
- [scoffs] Yeah.
Right.

19:05.078 --> 19:07.478
- Wait a second.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.013
- Yes?

19:09.115 --> 19:10.948
- Are you that damn jealous?

19:11.050 --> 19:12.984
- Whatever do you mean, darling?

19:13.086 --> 19:16.187
- Did you have something done
with those nurses?

19:16.289 --> 19:20.057
- Well, dear, when you have
a person with a drug problem,

19:20.160 --> 19:22.360
you remove the drug.

19:22.462 --> 19:26.564
- Is that what you
think you're doing?

19:26.666 --> 19:28.032
- Yes.

19:28.134 --> 19:30.067
You will not
ruin this shit for me.

19:30.170 --> 19:31.969
I've worked too damn hard.

19:32.071 --> 19:34.872
- You haven't done anything.

19:34.974 --> 19:38.042
- Really? I screwed you.

19:38.144 --> 19:40.611
I should get the
Medal of Freedom for that.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.346
- You really had them removed?

19:42.448 --> 19:44.382
- Was that the only reason
you were there so long?

19:44.484 --> 19:48.452
- I was there for my son.
- Yeah, right.

19:48.555 --> 19:52.890
- So is this, uh, is this
what you did with Ellie?

19:52.992 --> 19:54.258
Had her removed?

19:54.360 --> 19:56.127
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

19:56.229 --> 19:59.063
- Come on, take credit for it.

19:59.165 --> 20:03.434
- I wish I could, but
it was random gang violence.

20:03.536 --> 20:07.672
- Mhm. I'm gonna get
to the bottom of this.

20:07.774 --> 20:10.041
- Well, that bullet sure did.

20:10.143 --> 20:12.076
- I'm not too sure.

20:12.178 --> 20:14.745
- Hunter, we need to talk
about this Vice President.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.948
- I don't wanna talk about him.

20:17.050 --> 20:19.951
- What do you want me to do?
Deal with everything?

20:20.053 --> 20:23.020
- I like that.
You deal with it.

20:23.122 --> 20:25.089
- Yeah, I have been thus far.

20:29.529 --> 20:31.462
- [sighs]

20:33.933 --> 20:37.635
- [phone ringing]

20:37.737 --> 20:42.006
- Hello?
- I want to see you.

20:42.108 --> 20:44.475
- Well, First Lady,
I just can't.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.244
- At the White House.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.846
- I don't think that's
going to happen.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.949
- Oh, I think you may wanna
come here.

20:52.051 --> 20:53.951
- It's not happening.

20:54.053 --> 20:57.421
- What are you afraid of, honey?

20:57.523 --> 21:00.258
- I'm not afraid
of anything, dear.

21:00.360 --> 21:04.262
- Well, can you come see me?
Or I can have a

21:04.364 --> 21:06.831
conversation with the press.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.566
- The press?

21:08.668 --> 21:10.668
- You know all the vetting
we did on you

21:10.770 --> 21:13.004
and your husband, honey?

21:13.106 --> 21:17.608
- Yes, I do.
And we're clean.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.844
- No one is clean.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.046
Do you think we didn't find it?

21:22.148 --> 21:26.517
Or do you think we chose
to look the other way?

21:26.619 --> 21:30.688
- [laughs] I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:30.790 --> 21:35.426
- I think you do.
I'll see you at noon for lunch.

21:35.528 --> 21:38.829
- I told you that
I wasn't coming.

21:38.931 --> 21:41.499
- You will.
You're a greedy,

21:41.601 --> 21:46.804
curious little bitch.
You can't resist.

21:46.906 --> 21:48.439
- Listen--

21:51.344 --> 21:53.077
- Now I gotta deal
with this bitch.

22:01.054 --> 22:02.753
- Who was that?

22:02.855 --> 22:06.023
- That was the First Lady.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.558
- What'd she want?

22:07.660 --> 22:11.329
- She wanted to talk
to me about our vetting.

22:11.431 --> 22:12.997
- What?

22:13.099 --> 22:15.866
- She has nothing.

22:15.968 --> 22:18.703
- There is nothing.

22:18.805 --> 22:21.238
- I know.

22:21.341 --> 22:23.407
But do you think
she made up something?

22:23.509 --> 22:28.679
- With these two?
You never know.

22:28.781 --> 22:30.748
- Well, should I go?

22:30.850 --> 22:32.817
- No.

22:32.919 --> 22:35.920
- No?

22:36.022 --> 22:40.458
Mhm. You know what?
I think I will go.

22:40.560 --> 22:41.959
- Honey, no.

22:42.061 --> 22:45.029
- It's the White House.
She's not gonna do anything

22:45.131 --> 22:47.965
to hurt me there.
- Simone.

22:48.067 --> 22:51.235
- No, No.
I think it's time that I

22:51.337 --> 22:54.672
show her exactly
who her opponent is.

22:54.774 --> 22:56.941
- I don't like this.

22:57.043 --> 23:00.144
- No, no, it's gonna be fine.
Okay?

23:00.246 --> 23:01.779
- Are you sure?

23:01.881 --> 23:03.481
- Yes.

23:03.583 --> 23:06.817
Well, you go take the kids
to school and I'll

23:06.919 --> 23:09.987
go over there.
Okay?

23:10.089 --> 23:11.655
- Okay.

23:21.434 --> 23:23.701
- Hey.
- Good morning.

23:23.803 --> 23:25.736
- Did he come home yet?

23:25.838 --> 23:27.304
- No.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.140
- What the hell?

23:29.242 --> 23:31.976
- Yeah, I'm worried too.

23:32.078 --> 23:35.946
- Dammit.
Well, something is wrong.

23:36.048 --> 23:38.048
We need to go to the pharmacy.

23:38.151 --> 23:40.818
- Okay.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.119
- I'm gonna call him.

23:42.221 --> 23:43.854
- I have.
Twice.

23:43.956 --> 23:46.490
- Why the hell did you let me
sleep so long?

23:46.592 --> 23:49.360
- I was hoping he was gonna
be here when you got up.

23:53.766 --> 23:56.534
- Shit, Kareem.
Hey, please call me.

23:59.105 --> 24:02.006
- Okay. Come on.
We should go.

24:02.108 --> 24:06.243
- All right.
Let me put my shoes on.

24:06.345 --> 24:07.912
- What do you think
happened to him?

24:08.014 --> 24:09.580
- I don't know.

24:09.682 --> 24:12.082
- You don't think he went to...
- Dale, just don't.

24:12.185 --> 24:14.285
- I mean...
- Dale.

24:14.387 --> 24:16.620
- I'm sorry.
- Damn it.

24:16.722 --> 24:19.056
It seems like ever since I've
been with Barry's ass,

24:19.158 --> 24:21.292
bad things just follow me.

24:21.394 --> 24:23.227
- I'm sorry.

24:23.329 --> 24:24.795
- No, I'm sorry.
It's all right.

24:24.897 --> 24:28.098
I just...I just hope
Kareem is okay.

24:28.201 --> 24:31.669
- I'm sure he is.

24:31.771 --> 24:34.271
- He would have called me
like 10 times by now.

24:34.373 --> 24:38.375
- Yeah.
And to open the store.

24:38.478 --> 24:41.912
- No, no, this,
this isn't right.

24:42.014 --> 24:44.048
Come on.
Let's...let's just go.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.816
You good?
- Yeah.

24:45.918 --> 24:47.518
- Okay.

24:58.431 --> 25:00.798
- So you want some more?

25:00.900 --> 25:06.070
- No, no, I'm okay.
I need to go to work.

25:06.172 --> 25:08.205
- So you're gonna go?

25:08.307 --> 25:11.709
- I have to.

25:11.811 --> 25:13.344
- Okay.

25:13.446 --> 25:15.246
- Nancy, I have to.
If I don't go,

25:15.348 --> 25:17.948
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

25:18.050 --> 25:22.186
- I understand.

25:22.288 --> 25:25.256
- When I'm sitting in that house
and just looking

25:25.358 --> 25:30.361
at all of our memories.
Everything we've had.

25:30.463 --> 25:35.633
It just makes me so angry.

25:35.735 --> 25:39.136
- Well, what about what
happened in the White House?

25:39.238 --> 25:42.039
- Yeah, I know.
- And when you see her.

25:42.141 --> 25:45.409
- I know. I know.

25:45.511 --> 25:48.279
- So, if you really wanna go...

25:48.381 --> 25:52.182
- Honestly, I can't afford
to take the time off.

25:52.285 --> 25:53.484
- Priscilla.
- To tell the truth,

25:53.586 --> 25:55.586
if I'm gonna do this
without him,

25:55.688 --> 25:59.957
I've got to save some money.

26:00.059 --> 26:04.194
- Okay.
I understand.

26:04.297 --> 26:05.996
I understand.

26:11.504 --> 26:15.472
- Hey.
- Hey, good morning.

26:15.575 --> 26:18.809
- Good morning, Priscilla.
- Good morning, Richard.

26:18.911 --> 26:21.211
- You good?

26:21.314 --> 26:23.981
- Yeah, I'm actually about
to go to work.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.950
- You're going to work?

26:26.052 --> 26:29.286
- Yes, I am.

26:29.388 --> 26:31.488
- I'll see you there.

26:31.591 --> 26:36.060
- I'll see you later.
Thank you, Nancy.

26:36.162 --> 26:38.028
- You're welcome.

26:46.272 --> 26:48.472
- What was that about?

26:48.574 --> 26:51.008
- She came to talk to me.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.210
- What, did she see Sam?

26:53.312 --> 26:55.045
- She saw him.

26:55.147 --> 26:56.847
- What did he say?

26:56.949 --> 27:00.584
- Not much.

27:00.686 --> 27:02.186
- Okay.
- Well, listen,

27:02.288 --> 27:03.887
I made you some breakfast.

27:03.990 --> 27:08.025
- Just coffee.
I, um, I need to get in there.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.727
- Is everything all right?

27:09.829 --> 27:14.131
- If she's going in,
I would just like to be there.

27:14.233 --> 27:15.566
- Okay.

27:15.668 --> 27:19.503
- I'll see you later.
- See you later. I love you.

27:19.605 --> 27:21.405
- I love you, too.

27:33.185 --> 27:37.388
- [knocking]

27:37.490 --> 27:40.557
- DONALD: Open the door.
- Sir?

27:40.659 --> 27:42.960
- DONALD: Boy, open this damn
door.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.265
What are you do--

27:48.367 --> 27:50.167
What are you doing?
Hmm?

27:50.269 --> 27:52.536
- I'm sorry, sir.

27:52.638 --> 27:54.505
- So you're just not gonna
return my calls?

27:54.607 --> 27:56.640
- I'm sorry.

27:56.742 --> 27:58.375
- Okay.
Look, I need you to get dressed

27:58.477 --> 28:01.779
and I need you to get to work.
Okay?

28:01.881 --> 28:06.450
You got that?
- Yeah, sure. Yes. sir.

28:06.552 --> 28:10.754
- Okay.
Look, Allan, I know it's hard.

28:10.856 --> 28:13.190
- Yeah, it is.
- But work will help, trust me.

28:13.292 --> 28:15.259
It does for me.

28:15.361 --> 28:16.794
- Yes, sir.

28:16.896 --> 28:19.096
- Were you even gonna come
in today?

28:19.198 --> 28:24.401
- Of course I was, sir.
- Okay. Then go and get dressed.

28:24.503 --> 28:28.572
What? What? What?

28:28.674 --> 28:31.575
- I'm just happy you came
by to check on me.

28:31.677 --> 28:33.610
- Okay, Well, quiet as
it's kept, you are one

28:33.712 --> 28:36.413
of my favorite employees.
And if you tell anybody,

28:36.515 --> 28:38.048
I will shoot you.

28:38.150 --> 28:40.984
- I won't say anything.

28:41.087 --> 28:44.755
I mean, I just hope that you
look at me as, you know,

28:44.857 --> 28:48.192
more than just an employee.

28:48.294 --> 28:50.227
- What are you asking?

28:50.329 --> 28:53.097
- I mean, if I'm being honest
with you, I've always looked

28:53.199 --> 28:56.233
at you as, you know,
more of a father figure.

28:56.335 --> 28:59.169
- So, you want to be my son now?
Is that what it is?

28:59.271 --> 29:03.073
- No, no, no. No, sir.

29:03.175 --> 29:04.942
- So what are you saying?

29:05.044 --> 29:08.278
- What I'm saying is, sir,
as you know, I have

29:08.380 --> 29:09.913
a lot of respect for you.

29:10.015 --> 29:11.215
- Okay.

29:11.317 --> 29:15.018
- And I just I hope you can
look at me as not just

29:15.121 --> 29:17.287
someone that works for you,
but, you know, someone

29:17.389 --> 29:21.625
that you know has your back.
Someone that you can trust.

29:21.727 --> 29:24.862
- Really?
- Really.

29:24.964 --> 29:26.864
- Where is this coming from
besides all the booze

29:26.966 --> 29:30.000
I smell in your breath?
Huh?

29:30.102 --> 29:32.436
- Look, I've always felt
like this, sir.

29:32.538 --> 29:36.673
Alright?
I felt like this for some time.

29:36.775 --> 29:39.376
I have a lot of respect
for you, sir. Okay?

29:39.478 --> 29:41.678
You know that.

29:41.780 --> 29:44.214
If you want me to run anything
to the residence,

29:44.316 --> 29:46.316
if you need me to bring anything
to the President,

29:46.418 --> 29:50.621
I'd be more than happy to...
- Even after what happened huh?

29:50.723 --> 29:52.923
- Well, you didn't know anything
about that sir, right?

29:53.025 --> 29:56.126
- No, I did not.

29:56.228 --> 29:59.229
- So we're good then.
- So let me get this straight.

29:59.331 --> 30:03.867
You actually want to work closer
to the President, is that right?

30:03.969 --> 30:07.104
- That's right.
- Yeah, why?

30:07.206 --> 30:11.074
- Well you both
are powerful men. Mhm.

30:11.177 --> 30:17.080
And I want to learn all I can
while I'm working for you

30:17.183 --> 30:21.218
and at the White House.
And this is the first time

30:21.320 --> 30:26.723
I'm saying this, wow.
Um, I, um, I actually hope

30:26.825 --> 30:29.826
to run for office one day.

30:29.929 --> 30:31.662
- Hot damn.
Isn't that something?

30:31.764 --> 30:33.497
- Yeah, I thought
you'd like that.

30:33.599 --> 30:35.699
- Ah. No, no, no.
I'm just shocked.

30:35.801 --> 30:37.734
I mean, your girlfriend,
she's not even buried

30:37.836 --> 30:39.770
in the ground yet.
And here you are,

30:39.872 --> 30:43.874
talking about your future.
Wow.

30:43.976 --> 30:48.812
- Life goes on, right, sir?
- Yeah, yeah, it does.

30:48.914 --> 30:51.648
I guess, uh, I guess you're more
cut out for this job

30:51.750 --> 30:54.017
than I thought.

30:54.119 --> 30:55.919
- I think you're right.
- Yeah.

30:56.021 --> 31:00.290
- Thank you.
- You got it. Now get dressed.

31:00.392 --> 31:02.893
All right?

31:02.995 --> 31:05.596
- Yeah.
- Pronto. Allan, pronto.

31:05.698 --> 31:07.331
- I'm on it.

31:23.983 --> 31:26.516
- Good morning.
- Hi.

31:26.619 --> 31:28.518
- Thank you for coming.

31:28.621 --> 31:29.953
- No worries.

31:30.055 --> 31:32.556
- Were you followed?
- No.

31:32.658 --> 31:34.191
- Are you sure?

31:34.293 --> 31:36.860
- I have a VP detail.
I'm sure they'll inform

31:36.962 --> 31:39.196
the President that I was here.

31:39.298 --> 31:41.765
- Well, maybe we
shouldn't be here anymore.

31:41.867 --> 31:46.136
- I assure you, sir.
It's fine.

31:46.238 --> 31:51.041
- Did, uh, the Chief of Staff
ask you anything about me or...

31:51.143 --> 31:53.076
- The kids?

31:53.178 --> 31:55.212
- Yes.

31:55.314 --> 31:58.448
- Yes, sir.

31:58.550 --> 32:00.384
- I thought he was fishing.

32:00.486 --> 32:03.287
- Yes, I'm sorry.

32:03.389 --> 32:06.757
- So is he talking?
- Kyle? No sir.

32:06.859 --> 32:08.425
- Okay.

32:08.527 --> 32:10.427
- How long can I hold him?

32:10.529 --> 32:12.562
- I'm not sure.

32:12.665 --> 32:16.733
- Okay.
You're sure this is...

32:16.835 --> 32:18.802
- It's...it's okay.
You have my signature.

32:18.904 --> 32:20.470
I'll take responsibility.

32:20.572 --> 32:23.240
- You and I both know
they'll bury me for doing it.

32:23.342 --> 32:24.908
- And I'll handle it.

32:25.010 --> 32:30.414
- Sir, with all due respect.
Are you sure this is gonna work?

32:30.516 --> 32:32.015
- Removing the President?

32:32.117 --> 32:33.684
- Yes.

32:33.786 --> 32:35.419
- I'm not sure, Sam.

32:38.590 --> 32:40.957
- Well, you've created a...

32:41.060 --> 32:43.593
- Yeah, it's a mess.
I know.

32:43.696 --> 32:47.030
- I was gonna say
a hornet's nest.

32:47.132 --> 32:51.234
- Yeah. Okay.
Listen, the reason why I brought

32:51.337 --> 32:55.639
you here today and I didn't want
to say this over the phone,

32:55.741 --> 32:57.941
my wife is going to visit
the First Lady.

32:58.043 --> 32:59.943
- Why is she doing that?

33:00.045 --> 33:04.348
- She's insistent.
I just want to be sure that you

33:04.450 --> 33:06.450
could monitor her.

33:06.552 --> 33:07.884
- I can do that.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.486
- Okay. Good.
- Yes sir.

33:09.588 --> 33:13.023
- Thank you.
We're gonna get him.

33:13.125 --> 33:16.126
- I certainly hope so, sir.
- Yeah. See you soon.

33:16.228 --> 33:17.494
- Yes, sir.

33:25.938 --> 33:28.939
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:29.041 --> 33:31.641
- You made it today.

33:31.744 --> 33:33.710
- Yes, I did.

33:33.812 --> 33:35.946
- Okay.
Good, good.

33:36.048 --> 33:38.815
- Hey, thanks, man.

33:38.917 --> 33:40.484
- For?

33:40.586 --> 33:42.619
- Last night.

33:42.721 --> 33:44.955
- Did everything go okay?

33:45.057 --> 33:48.191
- Yeah.
Everything turned out just fine.

33:48.293 --> 33:50.460
- Okay. Good.

33:50.562 --> 33:55.165
- I'll see you later.
- Not so fast. Come here.

33:57.236 --> 34:00.303
- Am I missing something?

34:00.406 --> 34:04.107
- Do you want to tell me why
you were here late last night?

34:04.209 --> 34:07.310
- Yeah. I was called in
by the Chief of Staff.

34:07.413 --> 34:09.012
- For what?

34:09.114 --> 34:11.248
- You can't ask me that.

34:11.350 --> 34:16.153
Did, um, did you
come with anything?

34:16.255 --> 34:19.423
- Really, Alonzo? You know
you can't get anything in here.

34:19.525 --> 34:20.891
- Allan.

34:20.993 --> 34:23.593
- Look, if you don't believe me,
then go check

34:23.695 --> 34:25.562
your little cameras.
Okay?

34:25.664 --> 34:27.564
- I did.

34:27.666 --> 34:29.199
- And?

34:29.301 --> 34:32.836
- Okay.
But I'm watching you.

34:32.938 --> 34:35.405
- Hey, look at me.
Just stop.

34:35.507 --> 34:38.041
Okay?
Stop.

34:50.439 --> 34:54.941
- ♪ ♪

34:55.043 --> 34:59.112
- [phone buzzing]

34:59.214 --> 35:01.882
- Hello?
- Hello, Sam. How are you?

35:01.984 --> 35:03.550
- Max.

35:03.652 --> 35:07.354
- I'm just checking.

35:07.456 --> 35:09.990
- I'm good.
- That's good.

35:10.092 --> 35:13.760
And how's our house guest?

35:13.862 --> 35:16.763
- He's fine.
I'm about to check on him.

35:16.865 --> 35:20.300
- Are you sure you won't
let me do that?

35:20.402 --> 35:21.635
- I'm sure, Max.

35:21.737 --> 35:24.504
- You know, I'm sitting
in this box truck and I gotta

35:24.606 --> 35:28.141
tell you I was hoping it
had a package in it.

35:28.243 --> 35:31.278
- Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you.

35:31.380 --> 35:33.880
- You know that if you don't
eliminate the threat,

35:33.982 --> 35:36.082
he'll come after you, right?

35:36.185 --> 35:37.984
- Yeah, I know that.

35:38.086 --> 35:39.986
- And your wife.

35:40.088 --> 35:42.556
- He'd be a fool to do that.

35:42.658 --> 35:46.693
- And you think you're dealing
with a rational person?

35:46.795 --> 35:50.330
- I think I'm dealing with
a man that knows my limits.

35:50.432 --> 35:54.901
- Sam, you really need
to bring him to me.

35:55.003 --> 35:57.270
- Yeah.
I hear you.

35:57.372 --> 35:59.139
- I'm gonna leave this truck
here until you come

35:59.241 --> 36:01.074
with the package.

36:01.176 --> 36:04.678
- Yeah, well, wait on it.
- Sam.

36:04.780 --> 36:06.780
- I gotta go.
- MAX: Sam.

36:20.996 --> 36:24.431
- Kyle.

36:24.533 --> 36:29.402
- It has been exactly 18 hours
since Donald told me

36:29.504 --> 36:31.538
to meet him.

36:31.640 --> 36:33.506
- And?

36:33.609 --> 36:37.911
- He is going to unleash
all hell to find me.

36:38.013 --> 36:41.114
- Well, it's too bad
you're under his nose.

36:41.216 --> 36:44.684
- [laughs] Yes, well...

36:44.786 --> 36:46.553
- I need to talk to you.

36:49.524 --> 36:52.592
- Sam, you're out
of your league here.

36:52.694 --> 36:55.228
- I need to talk to you.

36:55.330 --> 36:56.897
- What is it, Sam?

36:56.999 --> 36:59.299
- You won't give me information,
but that's the only way

36:59.401 --> 37:00.934
you get out of here.

37:01.036 --> 37:06.206
- No, no, no, no,
that's not the only way.

37:06.308 --> 37:09.743
- You can't get communications
down here, in or out.

37:09.845 --> 37:11.745
I have this place secured
enough for everyone.

37:11.847 --> 37:16.082
You will get no help here, Kyle,
until you talk to me.

37:23.091 --> 37:25.659
- I did talk to you.

37:25.761 --> 37:29.663
- You need to tell me
what happened.

37:29.765 --> 37:32.799
- All right.
- Did you shoot Agent Yuma?

37:32.901 --> 37:35.135
- Sam...
- Did you shoot Agent Max?

37:35.237 --> 37:37.570
- What?
The Tooth Fairy-looking dude?

37:37.673 --> 37:40.240
No, no, no, no,
that...that's the bunny rabbit.

37:40.342 --> 37:43.410
Yeah.
God, you know, they...

37:43.512 --> 37:45.578
they have been really
violent lately for some reason.

37:45.681 --> 37:47.514
I don't know what
it's all about.

37:47.616 --> 37:49.115
- Are the bunny rabbit
and Tooth Fairy

37:49.217 --> 37:50.517
personalities of yours?

37:50.619 --> 37:54.454
- No, just the fairy.
I try not to use teeth.

37:56.725 --> 38:00.260
- This is all a joke to you.
- No, no.

38:00.362 --> 38:04.731
The joke's on you
when I get out of here, Sam.

38:04.833 --> 38:07.100
- All the more reason
for me to keep you in here.

38:07.202 --> 38:09.736
- You can't keep me here.

38:09.838 --> 38:12.272
- It's been fine thus far.

38:12.374 --> 38:17.043
- Okay.
Sam, this was all a real cute

38:17.145 --> 38:19.279
charade at the beginning,
but I am starting

38:19.381 --> 38:21.748
to get pissed off.
- I don't give a --.

38:21.850 --> 38:23.049
- Woo.
- I don't care.

38:23.151 --> 38:25.418
