( theme music playing )

00:38.706 --> 00:41.175
JEMAINE, WHO AM I?

00:41.275 --> 00:43.811
- "DO IT NOW!"
- YOUR MOM.

00:43.911 --> 00:46.680
OKAY, WHO AM I?
"OH, HELLO, BRET."

00:46.780 --> 00:48.249
- THAT'S MY MOM.
- OH YEAH.

00:48.349 --> 00:51.285
OKAY, WHO'S THIS?
AAAH!

00:59.460 --> 01:01.095
OH, YES.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE HER.

01:01.195 --> 01:02.963
WHO AM I THIS TIME?
( whooshing )

01:03.063 --> 01:05.299
- Woman: CHARLIE!
- WHO'S THAT?

01:05.399 --> 01:08.202
- CHARLIE! CHARLIE!
- OH. OH.

01:08.302 --> 01:11.672
I'VE GOT A CRAMP.

01:11.772 --> 01:14.074
YOU GUYS HAVEN'T SEEN
A DOG RUNNING THROUGH
HERE, HAVE YOU?

01:14.175 --> 01:15.409
- A DOG?
- WHAT KIND OF DOG IS IT?

01:15.509 --> 01:18.011
IT'S A YORKSHIRE TERRIER.
HIS NAME'S CHARLIE.

01:18.112 --> 01:21.014
- JUST A FOUR-LEGGED KIND OF--
- HE CAN'T HAVE GONE FAR.
ON FOOT?

01:21.115 --> 01:23.517
YES, WE HAD A DISAGREEMENT
AND HE RAN OUT.

01:23.617 --> 01:25.886
I'M JUST REALLY WORRIED.
HE HAS CANINE EPILEPSY.

01:25.986 --> 01:27.188
- TERRIBLE AFFLICTION.
- POOR CHARLIE.

01:27.288 --> 01:28.256
I'M BARBARA, BY THE WAY.

01:28.356 --> 01:29.657
- JEMAINE.
- BRET.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.126
GREAT. WELL, IF YOU SEE HIM,
I'LL BE WALKING AROUND.

01:32.226 --> 01:34.962
- SO, UM, THANKS.
- YEAH, OKAY.

01:35.062 --> 01:37.931
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
OKAY, BYE.

01:38.031 --> 01:39.900
( pop music playing )

01:40.000 --> 01:43.103
* I THINK I'VE FALLEN IN LOVE
WITH A GIRL, I'M SERIOUS *

01:43.204 --> 01:44.605
* THAT'S GREAT NEWS, BRET

01:44.705 --> 01:46.907
* TELL ME ABOUT THAT GIRL
THAT'S SO SERIOUS *

01:47.007 --> 01:48.942
* WELL, I DON'T REALLY
KNOW HER *

01:49.042 --> 01:50.744
* THAT DON'T SOUND
SO SERIOUS *

01:50.844 --> 01:52.246
* IT'S SERIOUS,
I'M DELIRIOUS *

01:52.346 --> 01:53.647
- * SOUNDS SERIOUS
- * YEAH

01:53.747 --> 01:55.816

01:57.618 --> 01:59.387

- * THAT'S GREAT NEWS

02:01.289 --> 02:03.023
* WHAT'S SHE LIKE?
WHAT DOES SHE DO? *

02:03.123 --> 02:05.426
* ALL I KNOW, DAWG,
IS THAT SHE'S CARELESS
WITH HER DOG *

02:05.526 --> 02:08.462
* I'M NOT SURE WHAT
SHE DOES, EXCEPT SHE
MAKES ME WANT HER *

02:08.562 --> 02:10.731
* SHE MAKES ME WANT TO
GET ON TOP OF HER *

02:10.831 --> 02:13.100
* THAT SOUNDS GREAT, MAN,
THAT SOUNDS GREAT *

02:13.201 --> 02:14.768
- * HEY, WAIT
- * WHAT?

02:14.868 --> 02:16.504
* MAYBE I'M CRAZY,
BUT WHEN DID YOU MEET
THIS LADY? *

02:16.604 --> 02:18.239
- * JUST THEN
- * WHEN?

02:18.339 --> 02:19.507

02:25.779 --> 02:27.248
Both:
* HOW'S YOU MEET YOUR LADY?

02:27.348 --> 02:28.849
* I WAS GOING FOR A JOG
AND SHE LOST A DOG *

02:28.949 --> 02:30.851
* I WAS RUNNING IN THE AIR,
SHE LOST A TERRIER *

02:30.951 --> 02:32.186
* WAS THIS ABOUT
20 SECONDS AGO? *

02:32.286 --> 02:34.188
* NO, ABOUT
23 SECONDS AGO *

02:34.288 --> 02:36.990
Both:
* WHOA WHOA, OH NO

02:37.090 --> 02:39.092
- * OH NO
- * OH NO, OH NO

02:39.193 --> 02:40.594

02:40.694 --> 02:42.363
* ARE YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING? *

02:42.463 --> 02:44.064
* NO, I'M THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING *

02:44.164 --> 02:45.833
* SO YOU'RE NOT THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

02:45.933 --> 02:48.035
* NO, 'CAUSE YOU'RE
THINKING I'M THINKING
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING *

02:48.135 --> 02:49.670

ABOUT A GIRL *

02:49.770 --> 02:51.605

02:57.445 --> 02:59.380
- * AND SOCKS?
- * THAT SOUNDS LIKE HER

02:59.480 --> 03:01.482
* HANG ON A MINUTE,
STOP THE TRACK *

03:01.582 --> 03:04.285
* EUGENE, STOP THE TRACK

03:04.385 --> 03:06.720
( music stops )

03:06.820 --> 03:09.790
* DO YOU MEAN THE GIRL
WHO CAME UP TO US WHEN WE
WERE RUNNING IN THE PARK *

03:09.890 --> 03:13.261
* JUST NOW AND SHE WAS LOOKING
FOR HER EPILEPTIC DOG? *

03:13.361 --> 03:15.363
* YEAH, THAT'S THE GIRL

03:15.463 --> 03:17.097
( music resumes )

03:17.197 --> 03:19.600
- * WAS HER NAME BRAHBRAH?
- * NO, I THINK IT WAS BARBARA

03:19.700 --> 03:22.135
- * HER NAME WAS BRAHBRAH
- * IT WAS BARBARA

03:22.236 --> 03:23.637
* THERE'S NO SUCH NAME
AS BRAHBRAH *

03:23.737 --> 03:25.339
- * IT'S BRAHBRAH
- * IT'S BARBARA

03:25.439 --> 03:26.840
- * IT WAS BRAHBRAH
- * BARBARA

03:26.940 --> 03:29.543

03:29.643 --> 03:31.545
* BRET, SHE WAS
LOOKING AT ME *

03:31.645 --> 03:33.281
* NO, SHE WAS
LOOKING AT ME *

03:33.381 --> 03:35.082
* BRET, SHE WAS
LOOKING AT ME *

03:35.182 --> 03:36.584
* SHE HAD HER EYE
ON MY KNEE *

03:36.684 --> 03:39.553
* DAWG, I'M SORRY,
SHE HAD HER EYE
ON MY GUNS *

03:39.653 --> 03:42.490
* OH, YOU'RE LOCO,
SHE WAS CHECKING OUT
MY BUNS *

03:42.590 --> 03:45.025
* NO, BRO, SHE HAD
AN EYE ON ME *

03:45.125 --> 03:46.760
* SHE HAD AN EYE ON ME

03:46.860 --> 03:48.929
* HOW COULD SHE HAVE
AN EYE ON BOTH OF US? *

03:49.029 --> 03:51.499
* WAIT A MINUTE,
YOU TALKING ABOUT THE GIRL
WITH THE LAZY EYE? *

03:51.599 --> 03:54.968
* I THINK SHE MIGHT HAVE
HAD A SLIGHTLY LAZY EYE *

03:57.070 --> 03:59.473
* WE'RE BOTH IN LOVE
WITH THE SEXY LADY WITH
THE EYE THAT'S LAZY *

03:59.573 --> 04:01.174
* THE GIRL THAT'S FLY
WITH THE WONKY EYE *

04:01.275 --> 04:02.776
* SHE'S SMOKING WITH AN EYE
THAT'S BROKEN *

04:02.876 --> 04:05.413

SHE LOOKS LEFT A LOT *

04:05.513 --> 04:08.115

WITH THE SEXY LADY WITH
THE EYE THAT'S LAZY *

04:11.519 --> 04:13.754
* THE GIRL THAT'S FLY
WITH THE WONKY EYE... *

04:16.390 --> 04:19.293
- ( barking )
- NO NO, THAT'S NOT HIM.

04:19.393 --> 04:20.794
- WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE?
- NO.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.863
- WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE HERE?
CHARLIE.
- NO.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.965
YOU SEE THIS ONE?
HE SEEMS TO RECOGNIZE YOU.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.634
NOPE, THAT'S NOT HIM.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.536
THAT'S HIM.
NO? IT'S NOT HIM?

04:28.636 --> 04:30.304
- NONE OF THESE ARE HIM.
- YOU DON'T WANT THESE ONES?

04:30.404 --> 04:32.373
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF I DON'T FIND
CHARLIE OR...

04:32.473 --> 04:33.707
YOU CAN HAVE
ALL OF THESE ONES.

04:33.807 --> 04:36.644
YOU GUYS ARE SO SWEET.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.446
- NO PROBLEM.
- WHERE DID YOU GET
ALL THESE DOGS?

04:38.546 --> 04:40.247
- JUST PEOPLE HAD THEM.
- THESE ARE JUST LOST TERRIERS.

04:40.348 --> 04:42.082
- OH.
- SO I GRABBED THEM.

04:42.182 --> 04:44.518
- I THOUGHT, "OH,
THEY MIGHT BE CHARLIE."
- I JUST GOT THESE.

04:44.618 --> 04:47.020
- RIGHT.
THANK YOU, TO BOTH OF YOU.
- JUST HELPING YOU OUT.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.057
- OH, I HAVE
A PICTURE OF CHARLIE.
- THAT WOULD HELP, YEAH.

04:50.157 --> 04:52.393
- THAT'S CHARLIE.
- OH, CUTE.

04:52.493 --> 04:55.729
ALL RIGHT, SO HE'S MORE
OF A CAT THAN A DOG.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.398
NO NO.

04:57.498 --> 05:00.434
HE'S IN A KITTEN COSTUME.
IT WAS FOR A PARTY.

05:00.534 --> 05:03.270
- OH RIGHT, A HALLOWEEN PARTY.
- THAT'S REALLY CUTE.

05:03.371 --> 05:04.938
NO, IT WAS A KITTEN PARTY.

05:05.038 --> 05:07.074
THEY DIDN'T ALLOW DOGS.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.976
YOU DRESSED YOUR DOG
AS A CAT?

05:09.076 --> 05:11.111
YEAH, NO DOGS ALLOWED,
SO IT WAS THE ONLY WAY
I COULD SNEAK HIM IN.

05:11.211 --> 05:13.113
- IT'S A GREAT DISGUISE
- THANKS.

05:13.213 --> 05:15.383
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET ME GIVE YOU MY NUMBER
JUST IN CASE.

05:15.483 --> 05:16.950
- THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
- IS THAT OKAY?

05:17.050 --> 05:19.152
- WE'LL GRAB SOME DINNER
OR SOMETHING.
- GREAT.

05:19.252 --> 05:22.189
- JUST CALL ME ANYTIME.
- YEAH, OKAY.

05:22.289 --> 05:23.256
- OKAY.
- GREAT TO SEE YOU.

05:23.357 --> 05:25.826
- THANKS, BYE.
- SEE YA.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.961
( dogs whimpering )

05:32.866 --> 05:35.135
Murray:
ALL RIGHT, JUST SOME NOTES
FROM THE LAST GIG.

05:35.235 --> 05:38.105
- JEMAINE, YOU HAD
GREAT STAGE PRESENCE.
- THANK YOU.

05:38.205 --> 05:40.173
FANTASTIC.
BRET...

05:40.273 --> 05:42.410
NO STAGE PRESENCE,
UNFORTUNATELY.

05:42.510 --> 05:45.513
THE LAST GIG?
I DIDN'T DO THAT GIG,

05:45.613 --> 05:48.248
EXACTLY.
OKAY, YOU'VE GOT TO
TURN UP TO THE GIG.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.750
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S NOT
REALLY STAGE PRESENCE.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.720
- WHERE WERE YOU?
- I WAS AT JAZZERCISE.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.922
- JAZZERCISE?
- I TOLD YOU I COULDN'T
COME TO THAT GIG.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.458
WHAT ARE YOU ORGANIZING
YOUR JAZZERCISE EVENTS FOR

05:57.558 --> 05:59.259
DURING GIG TIMES?

05:59.359 --> 06:01.762
YEAH, THAT WAS
A BIT OF A CLASH.
IT DOESN'T NORMALLY HAPPEN.

06:01.862 --> 06:05.365
YOU SHOULD ORGANIZE YOUR
JAZZERCISE FOR A DIFFERENT DAY.

06:05.466 --> 06:08.201
IS IT BECAUSE YOU'VE ALREADY
PAID FOR YOUR MEMBERSHIP

06:08.301 --> 06:09.903
AND YOU'VE GOT THESE
CLASSES SORTED?

06:10.003 --> 06:11.472
YEAH, I PAID FOR FIVE
AND I GOT SIX CLASSES.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.441
AND YOU'VE GOT
TO GO TO THEM?
OKAY.

06:13.541 --> 06:16.209
- SO WHY AREN'T YOU
GOING TO THESE CLASSES?
- WE HAD A GIG, DIDN'T WE?

06:16.309 --> 06:17.845
OF COURSE.
THAT'S WHY HE'S NOT THERE.

06:17.945 --> 06:19.647
I KNOW. IT'S A SHAME,
'CAUSE HE WOULD LOVE IT.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.281
IT'S A SHAME
THAT THEY CLASH,

06:21.381 --> 06:22.650
BECAUSE THESE CLASSES
SOUND FUN.

06:22.750 --> 06:26.253
OKAY, ITEM TWO.
THIS IS THE FINAL ITEM HERE.

06:26.353 --> 06:27.888
SONG IDEAS.

06:27.988 --> 06:30.023
- YES, I'VE HAD A SONG IDEA.
- OH, YES.

06:30.123 --> 06:31.158
- HAVE YOU?
- I HAVE, YUP.

06:31.258 --> 06:32.726
- BOTH OF YOU?
- YES.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.628
WOW. THAT TIME
OF THE YEAR AGAIN.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.598
LET'S HAVE A LOOK.
NOW TWO YEARS AGO

06:37.698 --> 06:41.234
WE HAD JEMAINE-- FOREST.
YOU HAD A FOREST IDEA.

06:41.334 --> 06:43.070
- DON'T REMEMBER.
- AND BRET...

06:43.170 --> 06:45.372
- "I WISH I WAS A TREE."
- YEAH, STILL WORKING ON THAT.

06:45.473 --> 06:47.508
QUITE SIMILAR TO
THE FOREST IDEA.

06:47.608 --> 06:50.210
AND THEN LAST YEAR SAILING
FROM YOU, JEMAINE.

06:50.310 --> 06:51.679
NO, STILL FINISHING
THAT ONE.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.981
YEAH? IT'S BEEN
NEARLY A YEAR NOW.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.216
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT SAILING.
- OKAY.

06:56.316 --> 06:57.585
BRET, NOTHING
FROM YOU LAST YEAR.

06:57.685 --> 06:59.152
- I DIDN'T DO MUCH LAST YEAR.
- YEAH?

06:59.252 --> 07:01.522
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU
BACK ONBOARD THIS YEAR
WITH AN IDEA.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.924
- SO WHAT IS IT?
- IT'S A SONG ABOUT...

07:04.024 --> 07:05.225
PEPILEPTIC DOGS.

07:05.325 --> 07:07.127
- EPILEPTIC DOGS.
- MM-HMM.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.497
OKAY.

07:09.597 --> 07:12.900
MINE'S ABOUT DOGS
WITH EPILEPSY.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.302
SO YOU'RE BOTH WRITING SONGS
ABOUT EPILEPTIC DOGS?

07:15.402 --> 07:17.437
WELL, EITHER WAY
YOU LOOK AT IT

07:17.538 --> 07:19.172
IT'S QUITE A COMPLICATED
SUBJECT, ISN'T IT?

07:19.272 --> 07:21.241
- WELL, IT'S--
- WHY DON'T YOU STICK TO
YOUR SAILING IDEA?

07:21.341 --> 07:23.944
- YEAH.
- BY THE WAY, IF YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TWO SONGS THIS YEAR,

07:24.044 --> 07:27.147
WHICH IS GREAT, WHY DON'T YOU
HAVE TWO DIFFERENT SONGS?

07:27.247 --> 07:29.783
YOU'VE GOT
EPILEPTIC DOGS, BRET,

07:29.883 --> 07:31.652
WHY DON'T YOU TRY
SOMETHING DIFFERENT?

07:31.752 --> 07:33.554
- WELL, BECAUSE--
- HOW ABOUT SAILING DOGS?

07:33.654 --> 07:35.155
THIS IS SOMETHING
I CARE ABOUT.

07:35.255 --> 07:36.924
- I WANT TO GET
THIS MESSAGE OUT THERE.
- RISKY.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.992
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW,
THE TOP BANDS,

07:39.092 --> 07:41.562
THEY HAVE THEIR SONGS HERE
AND THEIR POLITICAL MESSAGES
OVER HERE.

07:41.662 --> 07:43.564
OKAY?
NOT TOGETHER.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.733
'CAUSE THEN YOU'LL END UP
ALIENATING HALF YOUR FAN BASE.

07:45.833 --> 07:48.301
YEAH, BUT WE'RE TRYING
TO RAISE AWARENESS

07:48.401 --> 07:49.837
FOR THESE POOR
EPILEPTIC DOGS.

07:49.937 --> 07:52.339
MY POINT IS, IF YOU WERE
TO SAY RECORD A SONG

07:52.439 --> 07:54.875
THAT WAS ANTI-AIDS,
FOR EXAMPLE,

07:54.975 --> 07:57.578
THEN YOU'D END UP
ALIENATING ALL THOSE
PEOPLE THAT ARE PRO-AIDS.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.446
HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU
KNOW WHO ARE PRO-AIDS?

07:59.547 --> 08:00.781
NO ONE'S PRO-AIDS.

08:00.881 --> 08:03.350
GREG, JUST A QUICK
QUESTION, PLEASE.

08:03.450 --> 08:06.353
GREG, ARE YOU PRO
OR ANTI-AIDS?

08:06.453 --> 08:07.988
- ANTI.
- ANTI?

08:08.088 --> 08:10.223
OKAY, CAN YOU DO A QUICK
WHIZ AROUND THE OFFICE

08:10.323 --> 08:11.825
AND JUST SEE
IF ANYONE'S PRO?

08:11.925 --> 08:14.862
ALL RIGHT,
DO YOU WANT ME TO--
ANYBODY PRO-AIDS?

08:14.962 --> 08:16.797
I THINK YOU'LL FIND MOST
PEOPLE ARE ANTI-AIDS.

08:16.897 --> 08:19.499
WELL, HE'S-- THAT'S ONE.
ONE FOR ANTI.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.703
- WHAT WOULD YOU BE?
- I WOULD BE ANTI-AIDS.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.471
OKAY.
YOU'D BE PRO,
WOULD YOU?

08:24.572 --> 08:26.073
- I'M ANTI.
- YOU'RE ANTI?

08:26.173 --> 08:28.642
WELL, WE DON'T HAVE TIME
TO DO A PROPER SURVEY NOW.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.644
LET'S NOT GET ALL
BOGGED DOWN ON AIDS.

08:30.744 --> 08:33.480
- WHAT WERE WE TALKING ABOUT?
- EPILEPTIC DOGS.

08:33.581 --> 08:35.148
- OH YEAH, RIGHT.
- A CHARITY RECORDING.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.484
WELL, IF TOBY EVER HAD
THAT, I'D LIKE TO THINK

08:37.585 --> 08:39.252
THAT I TRIED
MY BEST FOR HIM.
YOU KNOW?

08:39.352 --> 08:41.789
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD DO THIS.
YEAH?

08:41.889 --> 08:44.091
- YES. LET'S DO IT.
- LET'S DO IT TO IT.

08:45.793 --> 08:48.395
* THERE'S A DOG
NAMED CHARLIE *

08:48.495 --> 08:51.264
* A LITTLE LADY
WHO MISSED HIM *

08:51.364 --> 08:53.533
* CHARLIE HAD
A LITTLE DISORDER *

08:53.634 --> 08:56.837
* OF HIS NERVOUS SYSTEM,
TALKING ABOUT THE THYROID *

08:56.937 --> 08:58.606
* OOH...

08:58.706 --> 09:02.142
* IF YOUR LITTLE DOG'S
PROBLEMS CONTINUE TO PERSIST *

09:02.242 --> 09:05.545
* THEN YOU MAY WISH TO SEE
A CANINE NEUROLOGIST *

09:05.646 --> 09:07.981
* I'M TALKING ABOUT
CANINE PEPILEPSY... *

09:08.081 --> 09:10.550
( phone rings )

09:10.651 --> 09:12.820
HELLO, BRET SPEAKING.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.589
HEY, BRAHBRAH.
THANKS FOR CALLING BACK.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.357
YEAH, I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF YOU MIGHT LIKE

09:17.457 --> 09:19.359
TO GRAB DINNER SOMETIME.

09:19.459 --> 09:22.329
OKAY, TONIGHT?
7:00?

09:22.429 --> 09:24.397
COOL. OKAY.

09:24.497 --> 09:26.767
YES.

09:29.637 --> 09:31.371
BARBARA, OH, HELLO.

09:31.471 --> 09:34.642
YEAH, I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU'D LIKE TO GET
DINNER AROUND 7:00.

09:34.742 --> 09:36.576
OH, REALLY?

09:36.677 --> 09:39.446
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:39.546 --> 09:41.849
( whispers )
COULD YOU GET OUT OF IT?

09:41.949 --> 09:44.417
HOW ABOUT 8:00?
THAT'S PERFECT.

09:44.517 --> 09:46.153
WHAT ABOUT 7:30?
OKAY, 8:00.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.856
ALL RIGHT.
BYE.

09:51.024 --> 09:53.761
I BROUGHT SOME PHOTOS
LIKE I SAID I WOULD.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.495
THIS IS CHARLIE IN HIS
CHEERLEADING OUTFIT.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.330
OH, THAT'S CUTE.
IS HE A GOOD CHEERLEADER?

09:57.430 --> 10:00.400
HE'S GREAT.
HE CAN MAKE A C AND AN L
WITH HIS BODY.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.636
- SO YOU TELL ME.
- SOUNDS GOOD.

10:02.736 --> 10:05.138
OH, AND THIS IS CHARLIE
IN HIS PUMPKIN COSTUME.

10:05.238 --> 10:06.740
HALLOWEEN?

10:06.840 --> 10:10.043
- NO, IT WAS FOR
A GOURD PARTY.
- GOOD.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.779
UM, THIS IS, UM...

10:11.879 --> 10:14.047
THAT'S HIS ENEMY.

10:14.147 --> 10:16.817
- HE HAS AN ENEMY?
- YES. I AM TRYING
TO FIND HIM.

10:16.917 --> 10:20.888
- HE GOES BY THE NAME OF SEÃ‘OR.
- I'LL KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR HIM

10:20.988 --> 10:22.956
- 'CAUSE HE COULD BE
AN IMPORTANT LEAD.
- I'LL FIND HIM.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.825
HEY, BRAHBRAH, DID I TELL
YOU THAT I'VE WRITTEN
YOU A SONG?

10:24.925 --> 10:26.526
- NO.
- I DIDN'T?

10:26.626 --> 10:28.228
YES, FOR YOU
AND ALSO FOR CHARLIE.

10:28.328 --> 10:29.863
IT'S ABOUT
CANINE PEPILEPSY

10:29.963 --> 10:31.999
AND HOW THAT, YOU KNOW,
AFFECTS DOGS.

10:32.099 --> 10:34.167
I JUST HOPE THAT
IT RAISES AWARENESS.

10:34.267 --> 10:37.104
THAT IS AMAZING.
IS JEMAINE WORKING
ON IT WITH YOU?

10:37.204 --> 10:38.505
- WHO?
- JEMAINE.

10:38.605 --> 10:39.807
YOUR FRIEND.
THE OTHER GUY.

10:39.907 --> 10:41.308
- OH, JEMAINE?
- YEAH.

10:41.408 --> 10:43.376
OH, PROBABLY NOT.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.778
HE SEEMS LIKE A REALLY
INTERESTING GUY.

10:44.878 --> 10:47.748
WELL, PEOPLE THINK THAT,
BUT HE'S NOT.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.783
HE SEEMS SMART TOO,
WITH HIS GLASSES.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.251
- OH, YOU LIKE THE GLASSES?
- YEAH.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.754
YEAH, THEY MAKE
HIM LOOK SMART,
BUT HE'S NOT SMART.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.756
HE WEARS THOSE BECAUSE
HE HAS WEAK VISION.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.257
- OH.
- YEAH.

10:57.357 --> 11:00.393
- HEY, SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.
- AS AN ANGEL MIGHT SAY.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.062
JEMAINE,
YOU'RE 15 MINUTES EARLY.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.131
THAT'S OKAY.
I'M FINE WITH--
I'M JUST GONNA WAIT.

11:04.231 --> 11:07.067
I MEAN, I DON'T MIND
IS JEMAINE JOINS US.

11:07.167 --> 11:10.170
I WOULD PREFER--
I'D JUST FEEL--
I'VE GOT 15 MINUTES LEFT.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.539
WELL, WE CAN SPEND 15 MINUTES
TOGETHER ANOTHER TIME.

11:12.639 --> 11:14.808
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.810
OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU
AGAIN SOON.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.311
- GOOD NIGHT.
- GOOD NIGHT.

11:18.411 --> 11:20.513
- SEE YOU AGAIN SOON.
- OKAY.

11:20.613 --> 11:23.016
SEE YA, BRET.
I BROUGHT YOU FLOWERS.

11:23.116 --> 11:26.019
HE SEEMS SO SWEET.
SO NICE.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.789
HE MUST HAVE BEEN ACTING
QUITE DIFFERENTLY TO
THE WAY HE USUALLY IS.

11:28.889 --> 11:31.091
HE REMINDS ME
OF LIKE A LITTLE PUPPY.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.225
HE'S HAIRY.

11:32.325 --> 11:34.294
WELL, HIS BEARD,
BUT I MEAN, THAT'S CUTE.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.163
- YOU LIKE THE BEARD?
- YEAH, I LIKE IT.

11:36.263 --> 11:38.198
IT'S VERY KIND OF MANLY.

11:38.298 --> 11:41.401
HE REMINDS ME MORE
OF A BEARDED LADY.

11:41.501 --> 11:44.004
DO YOU GUYS LIVE TOGETHER?

11:44.104 --> 11:46.373
SORRY, I DIDN'T HEAR
WHAT YOU WERE JUST SAYING.

11:46.473 --> 11:49.877
I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT THIS POOR DOG
WITH A CHRONIC CONDITION

11:49.977 --> 11:52.345
THAT IS CHARACTERIZED
BY RECURRENT SEIZURES.

11:52.445 --> 11:53.781
I THINK ABOUT THAT.

11:53.881 --> 11:56.984
I'M WRITING A SONG
TO TRY AND RAISE AWARENESS.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.152
YES, BRET TOLD ME.
THAT'S GREAT.

11:59.252 --> 12:02.890
BUT I'M ALSO
ORGANIZING A BENEFIT

12:02.990 --> 12:06.894
TO TRY AND RAISE
SOME MONEY FOR THESE
POOR PROPHYLACTIC DOGS.

12:06.994 --> 12:09.096
- EPILEPTIC.
- EPILEPTIC.

12:09.196 --> 12:10.130
THAT'S... YAY.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.332
YAY.

12:15.335 --> 12:18.338
YEAH, I MEAN,
I'VE BEEN THERE.
I HAVE BEEN THERE.

12:18.438 --> 12:21.741
IT'S NEVER EASY
WHEN YOU'VE GOT TWO CHICKS
INTO THE SAME DUDE.

12:21.842 --> 12:24.644
I'M TALKING ABOUT TWO GUYS
THAT ARE INTO THE SAME GIRL.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.613
WHOA, WHAT THE FUCK
IS THAT?

12:26.713 --> 12:28.748
I HAVE NEVER BEEN THERE.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.584
WITH ME IT'S ALWAYS
BEEN TWO OR MORE

12:31.684 --> 12:33.620
- GIRLS INTO THE SAME GUY.
- RIGHT.

12:33.720 --> 12:36.356
THAT GUY BEING
THE DAVE-ATRONIC 5000.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.725
- YEAH, WHAT ABOUT WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT?
- THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

12:38.826 --> 12:40.327
IF THERE'S TWO GUYS
AND ONE GIRL?

12:40.427 --> 12:41.829
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

12:41.929 --> 12:44.397
I HAD THE SAME SITUATION
ONCE WITH MY FRIEND DEREK.

12:44.497 --> 12:45.833
WHAT DID YOU DO?

12:45.933 --> 12:49.202
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
DEREK'S NO LONGER WITH US.

12:49.302 --> 12:50.938
OH.

12:51.038 --> 12:52.472
- UM...
- RIGHT.

12:52.572 --> 12:54.007
DID YOU...

12:54.107 --> 12:55.909
NO NO NO NO.
HE MOVED TO ARIZONA.

12:56.009 --> 12:58.411
OH, OKAY.
AND WHAT ABOUT THE GIRL?

12:58.511 --> 13:00.747
SHE MOVED TO ARIZONA ALSO.

13:00.848 --> 13:02.883
BUT I THINK THEY MOVED
TO DIFFERENT PARTS.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.152
IT'S ONE OF
THE BIGGEST STATES.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.821
SO YOU'VE JUST GOT TO
GET THE GIRL, BRET.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.990
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE
PUT ON THIS EARTH FOR.

13:10.090 --> 13:12.025
- YEAH.
- TO PRECREATE.

13:12.125 --> 13:15.762
- AND WHAT ABOUT FOR ME?
- DOES SHE LIKE EITHER
ONE OF YOU MORE?

13:15.863 --> 13:17.697
- I THINK SHE LIKES ME.
- ME.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.332
ME.

13:21.068 --> 13:23.636
- BRET.
- HEY.

13:23.736 --> 13:25.705
WHERE YOU GOING?

13:25.805 --> 13:27.674
JAZZERCISE.

13:27.774 --> 13:29.109
I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA
WATCH THE DOG SHOW.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.244
CAN'T DO IT.
SORRY, MAN.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.947
SEEMS LIKE AN ODD TIME
FOR JAZZERCISE.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.582
YEAH, IT'S AN IMPROMPTU
JAZZERCISE CLASS.

13:35.682 --> 13:38.218
- DOING IT BY YOURSELF?
- ME AND A COUPLE OTHER GUYS.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.520
JUST YOU AND A COUPLE OF GUYS
FROM JAZZERCISE, HUH?

13:40.620 --> 13:43.390
GETTING TOGETHER AND DOING
SOME IMPROMPTU JAZZERCISE

13:43.490 --> 13:44.757
AT NIGHT?

13:44.858 --> 13:46.326
YES,
WHAT OF IT?

13:46.426 --> 13:47.527
NOTHING.

13:47.627 --> 13:49.829
- YOU SEEN MY GLASSES?
- NO.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.132
I HAD A SHOWER AND I LEFT
THEM IN THE SINK.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.334
THEY'RE PROBABLY IN THE SINK.
HAVE YOU CHECKED THE SINK?

13:54.434 --> 13:56.369
- WELL, LET ME JUST CHECK IT.
- I'LL SEE YOU LATER, MAN.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.471
- BRET, THEY'RE NOT
IN THE SINK.
- ( door shuts )

14:05.212 --> 14:08.348
- BRET, WHOA.
- HEY, MEL.

14:08.448 --> 14:09.749
LOOK AT YOU.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.519
OH WOW.

14:12.619 --> 14:15.688
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON,
BUT CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING?

14:15.788 --> 14:17.390
WHAT?

14:17.490 --> 14:19.526
I CANNOT COUNT HOW MANY
TIMES I'VE LAID IN BED

14:19.626 --> 14:23.463
WONDERING WHAT A CHILD OF YOU
AND JEMAINE MIGHT LOOK LIKE,

14:23.563 --> 14:27.267
BUT IT LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE
THIS IN MY IMAGINATION.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.302
OH, I DON'T REALLY
WANT TO KNOW THAT.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.171
- CAN I TAKE YOUR PICTURE?
- NO.

14:31.271 --> 14:32.639
- SEE YOU, MEL.
- BYE.

14:32.739 --> 14:34.674
- ( crashes )
- Mel: OH, WHOOPS.

14:34.774 --> 14:37.410
- WHOOPS.
- SEE YOU, MEL.

14:38.845 --> 14:41.314
MMM, YUM.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.450
SO ARE YOU GONNA BE HELPING
US WITH THIS BENEFIT CONCERT?

14:43.550 --> 14:44.751
I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT IT.

14:44.851 --> 14:47.220
- I WANT TO,
BUT I'M TOO BUSY.
- OH.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.957
I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS,
ACTUALLY.

14:50.057 --> 14:53.426
I'M DEVELOPING A VACCINE
FOR PEPILEPTIC DOGS.

14:53.526 --> 14:56.163
- WHAT?
- I'M DEVELOPING A VACCINE.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.999
I'M SORRY, ARE YOU
A VET OR A DOCTOR?

14:59.099 --> 15:01.034
- NO, NOT REALLY.
- NO.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.370
BUT I GUESS I'M QUITE
INTELLIGENT.

15:03.470 --> 15:06.239
RIGHT, I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

15:06.339 --> 15:08.208
I TAKE IT EVERY 30 MINUTES.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.010
- YOU'VE BEEN TAKING IT?
- I TAKE IT, YEAH.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.445
AND AT THE MOMENT...

15:12.545 --> 15:16.749
I'M-- I'M SHOWING NO
SYMPTOMS OF EPILEPSY.

15:16.849 --> 15:19.586
BUT YOU DON'T--
YOU NEVER HAD EPILEPSY.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.421
NO, I DON'T HAVE EPILEPSY.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.957
BUT I THINK THAT'S
BECAUSE OF THE VACCINE.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.192
- RIGHT.
- YEAH.

15:25.292 --> 15:28.061
- ( phone rings )
- OH, SORRY.

15:28.161 --> 15:31.298
HELLO? REALLY?
THANK YOU.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.233
SOMEONE THINKS THAT
THEY FOUND CHARLIE.

15:33.333 --> 15:36.503
- WOW, OKAY.
- YES, SO I HAVE TO
GO MEET THEM.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.038
WELL, TAKE THAT.
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT
LEFT IN THERE.

15:38.138 --> 15:39.739
SO IF YOU DO FIND HIM...

15:39.839 --> 15:41.941
I CAN'T.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.743
MY BAG IS SO FULL.

15:43.843 --> 15:45.312
- WELL, UM...
- BUT THANKS.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.280
- OKAY, BYE.
- SEE YOU, BRAHBRAH.

15:50.817 --> 15:52.619
JEMAINE?

15:52.719 --> 15:54.387
- OH, BARBARA, HEY.
- HI.

15:54.487 --> 15:57.257
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
THAT'S SO CRAZY.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.126
SOMEONE CALLED AND SAID THEY
THINK THEY FOUND CHARLIE

15:59.226 --> 16:01.161
AND FOR ME
TO MEET THEM HERE.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.030
OH YES, THERE WAS A GUY DOING
THAT SORT OF THING HERE,

16:03.130 --> 16:05.332
BUT HE LEFT.
WOULD YOU CARE FOR A DRINK?

16:05.432 --> 16:07.334
UM, YOU KNOW,

16:07.434 --> 16:10.103
I DON'T--
I DON'T REMEMBER YOU
HAVING A BEARD YESTERDAY.

16:10.203 --> 16:13.040
SOMETIMES I GROW A BEARD.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.941
LOOKS LIKE IT'S GLUED ON.

16:15.042 --> 16:17.210
YES, AND SOMETIMES
I GLUE ONE ON.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.179
OKAY.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.648
- WHEN I'M PRESSED FOR TIME.
- RIGHT. MAKES SENSE.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.283
- YEAH.
- RIGHT.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.818
UM, IT'S GETTING
A LITTLE LOOSE ON THE--
THERE YOU GO.

16:25.918 --> 16:28.988
UM, I SHOULD PROBABLY
GO FIND THE GUY WHO THINKS
HE FOUND CHARLIE.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.624
- HE MIGHT BE BACK.
- I SHOULD FIND HIM.

16:31.724 --> 16:33.626
THANKS.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.595
( sighs )

16:35.695 --> 16:39.299
EXCUSE ME, I'M STILL
WAITING ON TWO WATERS.
THANK YOU.

16:41.434 --> 16:43.936
YOU READY?
THIS IS TAKE ONE.

16:44.037 --> 16:47.307
AND A ONE, AND A TWO,
AND AWAY WE GO.

16:47.407 --> 16:52.011
* THINK ABOUT
THE EPILEPTIC DOGS... *

16:52.112 --> 16:54.247
STOP, ACTUALLY.
STOP GUYS.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.249
- CAN YOU STOP
RECORDING THERE?
- WHAT?

16:56.349 --> 16:58.785
SORRY, I CAN HEAR
A PIANO PLAYING THERE.
WHO'S PLAYING THAT?

16:58.885 --> 17:00.019
- BRET.
- YEAH.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.988
WHAT, WITH YOUR FEET?
I CAN'T SEE ONE.

17:02.089 --> 17:05.192
- NO, I'VE ALREADY PLAYED IT.
- I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER
GUY IN THERE.

17:05.292 --> 17:07.360
IS THERE ANOTHER GUY IN THERE?
CAN YOU HAVE A LOOK AROUND?

17:07.460 --> 17:09.196
I THINK THERE'S SOMEONE
PLAYING A PIANO.

17:09.296 --> 17:11.664
- NO, IT'S A BACKING TRACK.
- WE'VE ALREADY GOT THE PIANO.

17:11.764 --> 17:13.566
- HI, BARBARA.
- HEY, BRAHBRAH.

17:13.666 --> 17:14.701

17:18.271 --> 17:20.807
I'M JUST ABOUT TO LAY DOWN
A LOCAL TRACK, BRAHBRAH.

17:20.907 --> 17:22.509
OH, GOOD.
YAY.

17:22.609 --> 17:24.411
SO ROLL IT.

17:24.511 --> 17:29.182
* THINK ABOUT
THE PEPILEPTIC DOGS *

17:29.282 --> 17:31.851
Jemaine:

YOU TWO.

17:45.765 --> 17:48.168
- ARE THEY FIGHTING?
- YEAH, NOW THEY'RE FIGHTING.

17:48.268 --> 17:52.071
I'LL HAVE TO STOP THEM.
I'LL BE BACK IN A SECOND.

17:52.172 --> 17:53.773
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
BRET!

17:53.873 --> 17:55.375
STOP IT.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.244
LOOK, THIS IS ALL
PROFESSIONAL EQUIPMENT.

17:57.344 --> 17:58.745
IF YOU BREAK IT
I'M PAYING FOR IT.

17:58.845 --> 18:00.647
WAS IT OKAY?

18:00.747 --> 18:03.015
IT WAS GOOD UNTIL
YOU STARTED FIGHTING.
WHAT'S HAPPENED?

18:03.116 --> 18:05.518
JEMAINE.
JEMAINE, I SEE
NO OTHER OPTION.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.656
I CHALLENGE YOU
TO A DUEL.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.425
OH NO.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.797
I ACCEPT.

18:17.897 --> 18:20.400
( dramatic music playing )

18:21.201 --> 18:23.102
* LOVE

18:46.559 --> 18:49.396
* YOU'RE A GENERAL SHOUTING
ORDERS TO YOUR ARMY *

18:49.496 --> 18:51.964

19:01.007 --> 19:03.810
* WHY DO WE

19:03.910 --> 19:06.946

* YOU LEAVE ME WOUNDED
LYING ON THE FLOOR *

19:19.659 --> 19:22.662
* I THINK I'VE SEEN
THIS FLOOR BEFORE *

19:24.864 --> 19:26.899
* LOVE

* THERE'S A BATTLESHIP
LOADED WITH EMOTIONS *

19:40.780 --> 19:43.583
* CRASHING ONTO SOME
LYING OCEAN *

19:43.683 --> 19:47.186
* AND I'M AFRAID IT IS
JUST AS I FEARED *

19:47.287 --> 19:50.690
* THIS OCEAN IS MADE
OF MY TEARS *

19:50.790 --> 19:52.325
* LOVE IS THE WEAPON

19:52.425 --> 19:55.395

20:00.900 --> 20:03.470
( both shouting )

20:07.039 --> 20:09.041
- SURRENDER. IT'S A DRAW.
- HI, GUYS.

20:09.141 --> 20:11.010
- HEY. OH, HEY.
- HI.

20:11.110 --> 20:13.280
- HEY.
- HOW ARE YOU, BARBARA?

20:13.380 --> 20:15.081
I'M GOOD.
SHOULD I COME BACK?

20:15.181 --> 20:18.618
- NO.
- IT'S FINE. WE'RE JUST
FINISHING UP, ACTUALLY.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.053
I FOUND THE PERFECT
LOCATION FOR YOUR CANINE
EPILEPSY BENEFIT.

20:21.153 --> 20:23.956
- YAY. YAY.
- YAY!

20:34.133 --> 20:36.369
- OH, HEY, BARBARA.
- HI.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.505
- HEY, BRAHBRAH.

20:38.605 --> 20:40.307
LOOK.
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

20:40.407 --> 20:41.974
- CHARLIE?
- YEAH.

20:42.074 --> 20:45.011
ALL BECAUSE OF YOUR CONCERT.
YOU GUYS, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

20:45.111 --> 20:46.813
IT'S AMAZING
BECAUSE IT WAS MY IDEA.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.748
HEY, I'VE GOT A NEW
BATCH OF THE VACCINE.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.684
- IT'S GOT TOFFEE IN IT.
- THANK YOU, THOUGH.

20:51.784 --> 20:54.521
- THAT DOESN'T
SOUND VERY MEDICAL.
- YOU LIKED IT.

20:54.621 --> 20:57.824
- HE MUST HAVE
SEEN ALL THE POSTERS.
- OH MY GOD, HE LIKES ME.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.426
OH, HE LIKES ME.

20:59.526 --> 21:01.528
- OH, I CAN TELL HE'S HAPPY.
- MISS?

21:01.628 --> 21:03.996
- YEAH?
- THAT'S MY DOG.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.232
I THINK YOU'RE MISTAKEN.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.167
- IT'S HER DOG.
- THIS IS CHARLIE.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.903
IT'S MY DOG MOCHA.
SEE THERE ON THE TAG?
IT SAYS MOCHA.

21:11.003 --> 21:14.173
MAYBE THAT ISN'T CHARLIE.
HE'S A DIFFERENT COLOR.

21:14.273 --> 21:17.109
ACTUALLY, HE DOES LOOK
LIKE A DIFFERENT BREED,
DOESN'T HE?

21:17.209 --> 21:19.412
YEAH, HE'S
A DIFFERENT BREED.

21:19.512 --> 21:20.847
I WAS WONDERING THAT.
HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE CHARLIE.

21:20.947 --> 21:23.082
DIFFERENT SIZE.

21:23.182 --> 21:26.586
- CAN I HAVE MY DOG?
- YES.

21:29.356 --> 21:31.190
MOCHA, COME.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.593
COME, MOCHA.

21:35.161 --> 21:36.863
I'M SO EMBARRASSED.
OH MY GOSH.

21:36.963 --> 21:40.433
- NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
- HE'S JUST A REAL STICKLER,
THAT GUY.

21:40.533 --> 21:43.770
- CHARLIE WILL SHOW UP.
- YEAH, HE'LL COME.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.872
- HE'LL COME AND FIND YOU.
- BRET, GET OUT.

21:45.972 --> 21:49.442
- THANKS.
- SORRY, JEMAINE'S GOT HIS
CREEPY HAND ON YOUR SHOULDER.

21:49.542 --> 21:52.545
- THANKS, GUYS.
- BRET, YOU'RE CROWDING HER.

21:53.580 --> 21:56.349
- ( applause )
- THANK YOU.

21:56.449 --> 21:58.985
IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE.
I'D LIKE TO DEDICATE
THIS SONG TO

21:59.085 --> 22:00.920
- ALL THE DOGS WITH PEPILEPSY.
- BRET, YOUR SPEECH IS BORING.

22:01.020 --> 22:03.490
THIS SONG IS DEDICATED
TO EPILEPTIC DOGS.

22:03.590 --> 22:06.626
- I LOVE DOGS.
- I LOVE DOGS WITH EPILEPSY.

22:07.827 --> 22:12.665
* THINK ABOUT
THE EPILEPTIC DOGS *

22:15.502 --> 22:20.540
* NOT ALL THE PUPPIES
ARE BORN SO LUCKY *

22:22.409 --> 22:24.977
* SOMEWHERE THERE'S
A GOLDEN RETRIEVER *

22:25.077 --> 22:27.914
* WHO'S HAVING A SEIZURE

22:29.416 --> 22:30.950
* SOMEWHERE THERE'S
A PUP SEIZING UP *

22:31.050 --> 22:35.321
* AND THERE'S A LABRADOR
WHO'S SHAKING ON THE FLOOR *

22:35.422 --> 22:40.359
* THINK ABOUT
THE EPILEPTIC DOGS *

22:43.095 --> 22:44.631
* SEND THEM SOME MONEY

22:44.731 --> 22:48.100
* TO STOP THESE DOGS
FROM ACTING FUNNY *

22:49.902 --> 22:54.140
* SEND A CHECK IN THE LETTER
TO MAKE A SETTER FEEL BETTER *

22:56.208 --> 22:58.678
* COME ON, MAKE A DONATION

22:58.778 --> 23:01.514
* AND SAVE
A SHAKY DALMATIAN *

23:02.815 --> 23:05.017
- * THIS IS THE REMIX
- ( dance music playing )

23:05.117 --> 23:06.553
* EP-ILEP-EP-EP-LEPTIC

23:06.653 --> 23:09.589
* EP-ILEP-EP-EP-LEPTIC,
EP-ILEP-EP-EP-LEPTIC *

23:09.689 --> 23:12.592
* EP-ILEP-EP-EP-LEPTIC...

23:12.692 --> 23:16.162
( dogs barking, howling )

23:16.262 --> 23:18.465
SO WHAT DID YOU
THINK, MURRAY?

23:18.565 --> 23:19.732
HOW DO YOU
THINK IT WENT?

23:19.832 --> 23:22.469
OH, WELL, IT WAS GOOD,
WASN'T IT?

23:22.569 --> 23:24.571
- DO YOU THINK SO?
- YEAH, IT WAS DIFFERENT.

23:24.671 --> 23:28.140
- BARBARA.
- HEY, GUYS.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.276
IT DIDN'T GO
PERFECTLY, BUT--

23:30.376 --> 23:32.745
IT WAS A TRAGEDY.

23:32.845 --> 23:36.483
WELL, IT RAISED AWARENESS
OF CANINE PEPILEPSY.

23:36.583 --> 23:39.552
THE, UM, STROBE LIGHTS GAVE
ALL OF THE DOGS SEIZURES.

23:39.652 --> 23:41.854
- NOT ALL OF THEM.
- WELL, THE EPILEPTIC ONES.

23:41.954 --> 23:44.757
- YEAH, ALL OF THOSE ONES.
- I THOUGHT THEY WERE DANCING.

23:44.857 --> 23:47.627
- NO, THOSE WERE FITS.
- EVEN THE GOLDEN DOODLE?

23:47.727 --> 23:49.496
- YES.
- THE SHIH-TZU WAS DANCING.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.297
- NO, HE PASSED AWAY.
- DOGS CAN'T DANCE, BRET.

23:51.397 --> 23:53.500
THAT'S A SHAME,
'CAUSE WE REALLY PUT
A LOT OF WORK INTO IT.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.402
SHAME TO KNOW IT WAS
BECAUSE OF OUR SONG.

23:56.503 --> 23:58.605
ALL RIGHT, STOP IT, GUYS.
I CAN SEE WHAT'S
HAPPENING HERE.

23:58.705 --> 24:01.173
- SORRY, BARBARA.
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

24:01.273 --> 24:03.643
YOU SEE, MY TWO LADS HERE
BOTH SEEM TO FANCY YOU.

24:03.743 --> 24:06.913
OKAY? I'M SORRY,
BUT THERE IT IS.

24:07.013 --> 24:09.949
NO, LISTEN.
BARBARA, IF YOU COULD CHOOSE
ONE OF THEM, PLEASE,

24:10.049 --> 24:11.718
THAT YOU LIKE THE MOST
AND THEN TAKE THEM

24:11.818 --> 24:13.720
ON A NICE DATE SOMEWHERE,
THAT WOULD BE GOOD.

24:13.820 --> 24:16.288
ON THE OTHER HAND,
IF YOU LIKE ME, THAT'S
A DIFFERENT STORY.

24:16.388 --> 24:18.591
- SO EMBARRASSING.
- RIGHT, I'VE GOT TO GO.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.793
- AND NO DUELING.
- HOW ARE WE--

24:20.893 --> 24:23.763
NO DUELING, AND THAT'S
THE FINAL WORD ON THAT.

24:23.863 --> 24:26.098
- EXCUSE ME, BARBARA.
- YES, OF COURSE.

24:26.198 --> 24:27.967
SEE YOU LATER, MURRAY.

24:28.067 --> 24:30.503
OH, THAT GUY.

24:30.603 --> 24:33.472
- SORRY ABOUT HIM.
- BUT BASICALLY WHAT HE SAID.

24:33.573 --> 24:35.575
WE LIKE YOU.

24:35.675 --> 24:37.610
I LIKE YOU GUYS TOO.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

24:37.710 --> 24:39.411
WE LIKE YOU LIKE YOU.

24:39.512 --> 24:41.648
- WE LOVE YOU.
- WHAT?

24:41.748 --> 24:44.551
- IN LOVE WITH YOU.
- I LOVE YOU AND HE LOVES YOU.

24:44.651 --> 24:47.453
I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT
YOU GUYS WERE GAY.

24:47.554 --> 24:49.255
- GAY?
- YEAH.

24:49.355 --> 24:51.524
- NO, WE'RE NOT GAY.
- HEY, GUYS.

24:51.624 --> 24:53.325
- HEY, MEL.
- HELLO.

24:53.425 --> 24:55.728
I MADE A MOCK-UP
FAMILY PORTRAIT

24:55.828 --> 24:57.263
OF WHAT YOU TWO
WOULD LOOK LIKE

24:57.363 --> 25:00.432
AND IF YOU HAD A BABY
WHAT THE BABY WOULD LOOK LIKE

25:00.533 --> 25:03.402
- COMING OUT OF YOU GUYS.
- KIND OF CUTE.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.538
- THANKS, MEL.
- YEAH.

25:05.638 --> 25:08.908
SHE'S MADE A LITTLE PHOTO
OF US AS A COUPLE.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.578
JEMAINE'S THE DAD,
I GUESS, AND I'VE GIVEN
BIRTH TO THIS LITTLE BABY.

25:11.678 --> 25:15.381
YOU KNOW, SORRY.
WHAT MADE YOU THINK
WE WERE GAY?

25:15.481 --> 25:17.950
I'M SORRY.
IF I WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT
YOU GUYS WERE BOTH INTERESTED

25:18.050 --> 25:19.619
I MEAN, I PROBABLY
WOULDN'T HAVE, YOU KNOW--

25:19.719 --> 25:22.054
Both:
PLAYED HAVOC WITH
OUR FRIENDSHIP?

25:22.154 --> 25:24.957
NO, I WAS GONNA SAY
SPENT EQUAL AMOUNTS
OF TIME WITH JEMAINE.

25:25.057 --> 25:27.026
- SORRY.
- WHAT?

25:27.126 --> 25:29.696
OH.

25:29.796 --> 25:32.632
TRUTHFULLY, I'M INTERESTED
IN BRET IF HE'S STRAIGHT.

25:32.732 --> 25:35.067
- YEAH.
- THAT'S BRET THERE.

25:35.167 --> 25:36.836
- YEAH, THIS ONE.
- COOL.

25:36.936 --> 25:39.371
- YEAH YEAH, FULLY STRAIGHT.
- OKAY.

25:39.471 --> 25:40.873
DO YOU WANT TO MAYBE
GO GET SOME COFFEE?

25:40.973 --> 25:42.875
- I'D LOVE TO.
- I MEANT BRET.

25:42.975 --> 25:44.577
- OH, YES.
- COULD JEMAINE COME?

25:44.677 --> 25:47.446
- MAYBE ANOTHER TIME.
- BUT, BARBARA, I THOUGHT--

25:47.546 --> 25:50.617
- MY NAME IS BRAHBRAH.
- BRAHBRAH?

25:50.717 --> 25:53.185
UH-HUH.
B-R-A-H-

25:53.285 --> 25:55.755
- B-R-A-H.
- BRAHA?

25:55.855 --> 25:57.757
- BRAHBRAH.
- TOLD YOU IT WAS BRAHBRAH.

25:57.857 --> 25:59.959
OH.
WELL, THAT'S--

26:00.059 --> 26:03.295
- SORRY, JEMAINE.
- SEE YOU LATER, BRET
AND BRAHBRAH.

26:03.395 --> 26:06.599
YES, THANK YOU.

26:06.699 --> 26:09.936
SO, BRAHBRAH, HOW LONG
HAS CHARLIE BEEN GONE?

26:10.036 --> 26:12.238
SIX YEARS.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.741
CHARLIE!

26:14.841 --> 26:17.109
( dramatic music playing )

26:27.286 --> 26:30.623
* LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE.
