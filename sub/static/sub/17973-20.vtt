(twittering)

00:34.634 --> 00:37.636
Good morning, Stoolbend!

00:37.638 --> 00:40.706
Oh, and good morning to you!

00:40.708 --> 00:42.508
I cause cancer.

00:42.510 --> 00:44.009
(laughs)

00:44.011 --> 00:48.814
Now, let's see what's going on
at the Browns' house.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.816
I'm the moon.

00:50.818 --> 00:53.318
RALLO:
Mom!

00:53.320 --> 00:55.087
You having a nightmare?!

00:55.089 --> 00:57.256
No. But what were
you gonna... never mind.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.091
Check it out.

01:00.693 --> 01:04.630
The day is here. I'm tall enough
to ride the Eliminator,

01:04.632 --> 01:07.032
the scariest
rollercoaster there is.

01:07.034 --> 01:10.202
Fine, we'll go to
Krazy Kingdom this weekend.

01:10.204 --> 01:12.471
Now I got to get back
before Cleveland

01:12.473 --> 01:13.972
realizes I'm not in bed.

01:13.974 --> 01:17.776
CLEVELAND:
Donna!? Donna!?

01:17.778 --> 01:20.846
I'm trapped inside
the duvet cover!

01:23.349 --> 01:25.584
Junior, you're
late for breakfast.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.920
And you should probably
skip breakfast.

01:27.922 --> 01:30.122
Sorry, Dad.
Little preoccupied.

01:30.124 --> 01:31.957
Got a big report
due in Social Studies.

01:31.959 --> 01:34.093
Really? What is it?

01:34.095 --> 01:36.762
Well, the topic is,
"What Makes an American?"

01:36.764 --> 01:38.931
So, I wanted to write about
a great American...

01:38.933 --> 01:42.167
You.
You want to
profile me?!

01:42.169 --> 01:44.103
Excuse me.

01:44.105 --> 01:45.871
ROBERTA:
My pancake!

01:45.873 --> 01:50.142
Come on, Junior, I'm granting
you total access to my life.

01:50.144 --> 01:52.177
Donna, give him your pass.

01:52.179 --> 01:54.346
(sighs)

02:00.186 --> 02:02.020
See your badge?

02:02.022 --> 02:03.989
Come on, Eddie,
you know me!

02:03.991 --> 02:06.458
Can't let you in
without a badge.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.993
That's cool, I get it.

02:07.995 --> 02:09.528
(grunts)

02:12.098 --> 02:15.701
...so instead of me repeating
eighth grade, we moved.

02:15.703 --> 02:17.836
Did you remember
to describe my youth as

02:17.838 --> 02:18.937
...hardscrabble?
Hardscrabble.

02:18.939 --> 02:20.506
Yeah.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.307
Dad, what are you doing?

02:22.309 --> 02:25.811
Enjoying the best part of my
job, other people's couches.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.279
You down with OPC?

02:27.281 --> 02:28.614
Sure, whatever.

02:28.616 --> 02:30.482
Pants off, Junior.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.184
This is America.

02:34.487 --> 02:36.321
Get all this down.

02:36.323 --> 02:38.957
My fellow American
citizens and I

02:38.959 --> 02:42.094
are discussing the important
issues of the day.

02:42.096 --> 02:44.663
Let's just say that I have it
on very good authority

02:44.665 --> 02:47.366
that Justin Long should be
named Justin Wide.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.700
Called it.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.169
Freedom of speech.

02:50.171 --> 02:52.104
This is what our
descendants fought for.

02:52.106 --> 02:55.707
Should we sing
the National Anthem?

02:55.709 --> 02:58.110
(to "Auld Lang Syne"):
♪ I pledge allegiance

02:58.112 --> 03:00.045
♪ To the flag

03:00.047 --> 03:04.183
♪ Da da da da da da da

03:04.185 --> 03:10.322
ALL:
♪ Da da da da da da da da

03:10.324 --> 03:13.025

03:13.960 --> 03:17.029
RALLO:
Boom. Boom. Boom.

03:17.031 --> 03:19.431
Hello down there,
my tiny friends.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.366
Guess which one of us

03:21.368 --> 03:23.936
has grown tall enough
to ride the Eliminator?

03:23.938 --> 03:27.139
I don't know, Rajon Rondo?
He seems pretty tall.

03:27.141 --> 03:28.941
No, he said
which one of us.

03:28.943 --> 03:30.609
Oh, I thought
he meant black people.

03:30.611 --> 03:32.144
I'm talking about me.

03:32.146 --> 03:34.613
I've been getting my eight hours
and drinking my milk.

03:34.615 --> 03:37.683
Mama's taking me to
Krazy Kingdom this weekend!

03:37.685 --> 03:39.084
Rallo, would you
take my frog,

03:39.086 --> 03:41.019
Mr. Ribbit, with you up
on that roller coaster?

03:41.021 --> 03:43.255
I want to see if his eyes
pop at that altitude.

03:43.257 --> 03:46.491
I will take him
in the name of science.

03:46.493 --> 03:48.794
Now make sure your moms
brings the $65

03:48.796 --> 03:50.929
for the souvenir photo
at the end of the ride.

03:50.931 --> 03:53.031
Of course!
That's the most important part!

03:53.033 --> 03:55.100
I already know the face
I'm gonna make.

03:55.102 --> 03:57.069
(people screaming
on roller coaster)

04:01.608 --> 04:02.841
(door opens)

04:02.843 --> 04:05.010
Hey, y'all.

04:05.012 --> 04:07.212
(frog croaks)
Just humbly
returning home

04:07.214 --> 04:09.348
from my
all-American work day.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.783
Hey, Junior, why don't you
read us your report?

04:11.785 --> 04:14.119
Yeah, yeah, no, yeah,

04:14.121 --> 04:16.788
no, no, yeah, no.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.090
Uh, no.

04:18.092 --> 04:20.092
Come on, let's hear it.

04:21.127 --> 04:23.462
(microphone feedback squeals)

04:23.464 --> 04:24.963
Mom, Dad,

04:24.965 --> 04:27.266
time for the
report about me!

04:27.268 --> 04:29.468
Excuse me,
pardon me, sorry.

04:29.470 --> 04:32.204
Makin' us wait on the porch
just for a ridiculous entrance.

04:32.206 --> 04:34.006
You may begin, Junior.

04:34.008 --> 04:36.608
(sighs)
Fine.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.610
"What Makes an American."

04:38.612 --> 04:39.378
Mm...

04:39.380 --> 04:41.947
Corners cut. Promises broken.

04:41.949 --> 04:45.083
Allegiance pledged only to
selfish instincts.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.452
This is a day in the life
of my father,

04:47.454 --> 04:49.187
a typical American.

04:49.189 --> 04:50.989
Let's see where
he's going with this.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.991
As he shovels down junk food...

04:52.993 --> 04:53.992
Well...

04:53.994 --> 04:55.594
...shows no respect
for his work...

04:55.596 --> 04:56.628
(awkward laugh)

04:56.630 --> 04:58.997
...and spends the day
in a drunken stupor...

04:58.999 --> 05:00.432
Libel.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.768
...my father is America:

05:02.770 --> 05:05.337
wasteful, gluttonous,
and self-satisfied,

05:05.339 --> 05:07.439
with no sense of purpose.

05:07.441 --> 05:10.942
In summation, mm-mm-mm.

05:15.248 --> 05:17.449
Lavar, your son just
got his ass blasted!

05:17.451 --> 05:18.750
Sit down!

05:20.119 --> 05:21.853
Cleveland,
are you all right?

05:21.855 --> 05:22.921
Fine.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.356
I'm fine.

05:24.358 --> 05:27.025
(whimpers)
You're fat!

05:27.027 --> 05:28.393
You're all fat!

05:29.996 --> 05:33.398

05:55.356 --> 05:59.024
(grunting and moaning)

05:59.026 --> 06:01.193
(farting and squirting,
Cleveland moaning and sobbing)

06:04.797 --> 06:07.599
CLEVELAND:
Why, why, why...

06:07.601 --> 06:08.500
Oh....

06:09.135 --> 06:11.536
Oh, look, a burrito!

06:11.538 --> 06:13.372
(grunting)

06:13.374 --> 06:14.706
Whoa, whoa, ah!

06:15.708 --> 06:17.409
(grunts)

06:30.456 --> 06:32.991
I think it's best
if we all agree

06:32.993 --> 06:36.762
to keep the details of my
accident strictly between us.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.930
All right, here's the guy who
fell off the toilet.

06:38.932 --> 06:39.765
(interns laugh)

06:39.767 --> 06:41.166
I don't want no scrubs!

06:41.168 --> 06:42.834
Now, Cleveland,
your case is an

06:42.836 --> 06:45.437
important learning opportunity
for these interns.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.439
You have a sustained abrasion
of the nerve root

06:47.441 --> 06:50.609
at the cauda equina--
or, in layman's terms,

06:50.611 --> 06:51.977
a "poop chute bruise."

06:51.979 --> 06:53.378
(interns laugh)

06:53.380 --> 06:55.480
Or we came up with some other
good ones, too.

06:55.482 --> 06:58.984
Uh, a "cracked crack," "a
heinous sprainus of the anus,"

06:58.986 --> 07:01.787
"wrecked rectum,"
"pooper blooper,"

07:01.789 --> 07:04.289
"spraint..." (laughs)

07:04.291 --> 07:06.158
That was yours, right?
Yes, sir.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.026
Nice job.
You're a doctor now.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.962
All right!
Vicodin for everybody!

07:10.964 --> 07:12.431
May I leave now?

07:12.433 --> 07:13.932
Oh, hold on, Cleveland.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.333
Does anybody else
have anything?

07:15.335 --> 07:18.270
Uh, chocolate
sore-butt?

07:18.272 --> 07:19.304
You're fired.

07:19.306 --> 07:21.540
No, wait,
I just got that.

07:21.542 --> 07:22.941
You're a doctor now, too.

07:22.943 --> 07:26.378
(laughs)
Chocolate sore-bu!

07:26.380 --> 07:28.113
Oh, I think
that's my favorit.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.182
(all laughing)

07:33.419 --> 07:34.719
Oh, that's rich.

07:37.023 --> 07:39.191
Well, thank God the doctor
said it wasn't serious.

07:39.193 --> 07:41.126
I could've died.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.995
And Junior, I ask that
you not include

07:43.997 --> 07:47.432
this embarrassing episode in
your embarrassing report.

07:47.434 --> 07:50.101
I'm not writing my report
about you anymore, Dad.

07:50.103 --> 07:53.438
I'm not really looking to remind
people that we're related.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.707
The teasing about
your toilet accident,

07:55.709 --> 07:58.043
or "crapcident," has been,

07:58.045 --> 08:00.312
at best, unkind.

08:00.314 --> 08:02.113
How did they
even hear about it?

08:02.115 --> 08:04.082
I mentioned it to
everyone I know.

08:04.084 --> 08:06.284
I also mentioned it
to everyone I know.

08:06.286 --> 08:09.454
And introduced myself to a few
people just to tell them.

08:09.456 --> 08:12.290
I tweeted it to my
1.2 million followers.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.092
Well, falling off the toilet
is nothing

08:14.094 --> 08:16.027
to be ashamed of, Junior.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.762
Don't call me Junior.

08:17.764 --> 08:21.099
From now on, my name
is Carlton Brown.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.435
Come on, step-siblings.

08:24.470 --> 08:25.971
(sighs)

08:25.973 --> 08:27.305
Don't worry, Cleveland.

08:27.307 --> 08:28.874
Carlton will come around.

08:28.876 --> 08:29.875
Who?

08:29.877 --> 08:30.942
Oh, Carlton Brown.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.044
He's just trying to get
between me and my son,

08:33.046 --> 08:35.914
who I love and I want to
be proud of me.

08:35.916 --> 08:38.950
That I can't be the only one
who's ever fallen off a toilet.

08:38.952 --> 08:41.019
I'll prove it!

08:42.822 --> 08:46.191
I wonder if my
Match.com profile's still up.

08:51.697 --> 08:53.431
Hey, Roberta.

08:53.433 --> 08:55.133
Gonna become
a man this weekend.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.535
What's that, Rallo?

08:56.537 --> 08:57.969
Let me ask you something.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.938
You're an experienced
young woman.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.439
You remember
your first time?

09:01.441 --> 09:02.774
What?!

09:02.776 --> 09:05.010
What makes you even think
I had a first time?

09:05.012 --> 09:07.145
Come on, I know you
like to go fast.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.780
Did you scream?
What?!

09:08.782 --> 09:11.416
When you were done,
did you get right back on?
Rallo!

09:11.418 --> 09:13.752
Did you take a picture?
Did anyone throw up on you?

09:13.754 --> 09:15.453
Is it better in
the front or in the back?

09:15.455 --> 09:17.522
What face did you make?
Was there a long line?

09:17.524 --> 09:18.957
Did you keep your eyes open
the whole time?

09:18.959 --> 09:20.625
Were you worried you were
gonna get stuck?

09:20.627 --> 09:22.093
How long did you think
you were upside down?

09:22.095 --> 09:25.330
That is my business and
I am not talking about it!

09:25.332 --> 09:27.499
Get out!

09:27.501 --> 09:29.034
(scoffs)
I'm not gonna tell anybody

09:29.036 --> 09:31.202
about my first roller coaster.

09:33.272 --> 09:35.340
Thank you, diverse group
of strangers,

09:35.342 --> 09:37.876
for agreeing to meet
in my basement.

09:37.878 --> 09:40.679
I have in my hand stolen
hospital records,

09:40.681 --> 09:43.081
revealing that each of you,
at one time,

09:43.083 --> 09:45.483
fell from a height
of less than three feet,

09:45.485 --> 09:47.586
most likely from
a seated position,

09:47.588 --> 09:51.122
with <i>Us Weekly</i> paper cuts
on the upper thighs.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.991
Queimporta, so what?!

09:52.993 --> 09:54.626
Get to the point, <i>ese!</i>

09:54.628 --> 09:56.161
Wha... are you Hispanic?

09:56.163 --> 09:58.930
Si... what,
I can't dress how I want?

09:58.932 --> 10:02.867
The point is, I believe
that every one of you

10:02.869 --> 10:05.103
fell off the toilet.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.838
Well!
Oh, come on.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.440
<i>Sacre bleu!</i>

10:08.442 --> 10:09.774
Wait, now you're...

10:09.776 --> 10:11.810
Oh, where was I?
Oh, yeah...

10:11.812 --> 10:13.645
I fell off
the toilet, too!

10:13.647 --> 10:16.414
But if we all came forward,
we could prevent

10:16.416 --> 10:18.984
others from suffering
like we have.

10:18.986 --> 10:23.088
And my son could be
proud of me again.

10:23.090 --> 10:25.357
(clears throat)
Emmy.

10:25.359 --> 10:28.259
So, who's willing
to stand with me

10:28.261 --> 10:31.129
and become the face of
toilet-related injuries?!

10:31.131 --> 10:33.198
Drop dead!
You're the only ignoramus

10:33.200 --> 10:35.100
dumb enougo
fall off the.

10:36.836 --> 10:39.771
Oh, one thing, old-timer.

10:39.773 --> 10:42.173
How exactly did you
injure yourself?

10:42.175 --> 10:43.541
Gay sex.

10:43.543 --> 10:45.176
Good day!

10:48.914 --> 10:50.015
(yells)

10:50.017 --> 10:51.449
Uncaring bastards!

10:51.451 --> 10:52.651
Who was that?

10:52.653 --> 10:54.452
The evil toilet industry.

10:54.454 --> 10:56.821
Big Toilet?
Mm-hmm.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.757
I called American Standard

10:58.759 --> 11:00.992
about making
their toilets safer.

11:00.994 --> 11:04.796
Those flush fat cats
were not bowled over.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.931
So, I plunged ahead
and said,

11:06.933 --> 11:09.668
"Tanks for nothing,
you pieces of (bleep)."

11:09.670 --> 11:11.936
(sighs) So what's the next
beat of this story?

11:11.938 --> 11:14.806
Well, since I'm obviously
alone in this,

11:14.808 --> 11:18.943
I am going to single-handedly
make sure no one else

11:18.945 --> 11:21.946
suffers the indignity of
injuring themselves

11:21.948 --> 11:24.249
while growling one out.

11:24.251 --> 11:29.487
And by doing so,
regain the respect of my son!

11:29.489 --> 11:32.490
And that's just one of
the uses for Formaldehyde.

11:32.492 --> 11:33.825
Wow.

11:33.827 --> 11:34.826
Whoa.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.361
I can't believe this.

11:36.363 --> 11:39.631
You're writing your
report on Gus?

11:39.633 --> 11:42.500
He's a very accomplished
bartender and filmmaker.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.936
Come on, Gus, what do you
say we finish this report

11:44.938 --> 11:46.104
upstairs in my room?

11:46.106 --> 11:48.640
Unfortunately,
I can't handle stairs,

11:48.642 --> 11:50.975
for I have
the knees of a cow.

11:50.977 --> 11:53.645
But if you'd agree
to carry me, Carlton...

11:53.647 --> 11:55.914
(Rollo yells, then a thump)

11:55.916 --> 11:58.249
(yelling)

11:58.251 --> 12:00.118
Are you wrinkling up
my Juicy pants?!

12:00.120 --> 12:01.286
Yeah.

12:01.288 --> 12:03.521
'Cause I'm practicing up
for that.

12:05.524 --> 12:06.591
That's it!

12:07.526 --> 12:08.693
My only poster!

12:10.096 --> 12:11.029
Wheeeee!

12:11.031 --> 12:12.664
This is wonderful!

12:16.135 --> 12:18.703
(gasps)
We've been Katrina'd!

12:18.705 --> 12:21.005
CLEVELAND:
Junior, get in here and
bring your notepad!

12:21.007 --> 12:22.974
There's no one here
by that name!

12:22.976 --> 12:25.043
(groans)
Carlton!

12:25.045 --> 12:26.611
Coming!

12:30.182 --> 12:33.952
Son, get ready to be proud of
your father again.

12:33.954 --> 12:36.187
The Toilet Bar.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.355
Patent denied.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.090
Check this out.

12:39.092 --> 12:43.261
"Public Hearing, State Capitol,
Toilet Safety Proposal?!"

12:43.263 --> 12:45.463
That's right.
I got it on the docket.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.298
Called in a favor
with my man Benson

12:47.300 --> 12:48.800
at the governor's office.

12:48.802 --> 12:50.368
That's great, Cleveland.

12:50.370 --> 12:51.870
Roberta, take your brothers,

12:51.872 --> 12:53.972
pack some overnight bags,
and meet me at the car.

12:53.974 --> 12:57.041
We're going to the amusement
park a little early.

12:57.043 --> 12:58.176
Are we there yet?!

12:58.178 --> 12:59.644
We're not in the car
yet, Rallo.

12:59.646 --> 13:01.246
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

13:01.248 --> 13:03.414
Cleveland, the kids
and I will be back

13:03.416 --> 13:05.250
whenever you stop
acting the fool.

13:05.252 --> 13:06.084
Donna!

13:06.086 --> 13:07.952
Junior, don't leave!

13:07.954 --> 13:09.988
Come with me to the hearing.

13:09.990 --> 13:10.989
Don't you see?

13:10.991 --> 13:14.125
I'm doing all this for you!

13:14.127 --> 13:16.027
You're a sad weirdo.

13:17.129 --> 13:18.329
Good riddance!

13:18.331 --> 13:20.932
When I appear
on the underperforming

13:20.934 --> 13:24.202
<i>Piers Morgan Tonight,</i>
<i>they'll rue the day</i>

13:24.204 --> 13:27.672
they turned their backs
on Cleveland Brown.

13:27.674 --> 13:31.209
The bar has been raised.

13:40.586 --> 13:44.355
And now, America,
the bar has been lowered.

13:44.357 --> 13:45.857
(toilet flushes)

13:45.859 --> 13:47.325
Wow.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.495
That was... ooh.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.696
Wow.

13:51.698 --> 13:52.630
(remote blips)

13:52.632 --> 13:54.132
This is Cleveland Brown.

13:54.134 --> 13:58.336
I have sustained no injuries and
have fallen zero times

13:58.338 --> 14:00.171
since docking was initiated.

14:00.173 --> 14:04.809
The test of the Toilet Bar beta
version was a complete success!

14:04.811 --> 14:06.644
Now, to release the bar...

14:06.646 --> 14:09.781
(grunting)

14:09.783 --> 14:11.616
All right, design flaw.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.117
No biggie.

14:13.119 --> 14:16.287
Unfortunately, since I've been
left alone indefinitely,

14:16.289 --> 14:18.923
I'll now be forced
to break the prototype

14:18.925 --> 14:20.959
in order to free myself.

14:20.961 --> 14:23.027
(grunting)

14:28.033 --> 14:29.434
(panting)

14:29.436 --> 14:31.302
Wait a minute,
let me try something.

14:31.304 --> 14:34.505
♪ Like a good neighbor,
State Farm is there. ♪

14:34.507 --> 14:35.506
Dang.

14:35.508 --> 14:36.674
I'm gonna die.

14:41.247 --> 14:42.480
(grunting)

14:42.482 --> 14:43.915
Help!

14:43.917 --> 14:46.017
I'm stuck on a toilet

14:46.019 --> 14:49.687
because I built a defective
toilet safety bar

14:49.689 --> 14:55.093
trying to prove to my son I'm
not the idiot he said I was

14:55.095 --> 14:57.996
in his Social Studies report!

14:57.998 --> 14:59.264
(takes deep breath)

14:59.266 --> 15:05.370
Also, Rallo wants
to go on a roller coaster!

15:07.439 --> 15:09.507
(people screaming)

15:09.509 --> 15:12.877
At last we meet, Eliminator.

15:17.616 --> 15:20.518
My good man, I think you'll
find everything's in order.

15:22.988 --> 15:24.088
What are you doing?

15:25.991 --> 15:27.091
Whew!

15:28.928 --> 15:30.094
Sorry, little guy.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.829
But I won't get
my picture!

15:31.831 --> 15:33.331
Hey, you might want
to get him checked out,

15:33.333 --> 15:35.199
make sure he doesn't have that
Webster thing.

15:35.201 --> 15:36.734
What have
I been saying?!

15:39.104 --> 15:42.941
I have now been sitting
on this toilet for 25 hours,

15:42.943 --> 15:45.310
my second-longest time ever.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.979
At this point,
the only thing keeping me going

15:47.981 --> 15:49.847
is my toothpaste art.

15:50.749 --> 15:53.117
Might as well sign it.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.320
Holy frijole, that's it!

16:05.698 --> 16:09.500
All right, Window, you don't
like me and I don't like you.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.769
But we gotta work together now,

16:11.771 --> 16:15.106
because this is
the last chance I've got.

16:16.308 --> 16:19.444
Godspeed, roll of toilet paper.

16:22.348 --> 16:26.150
"Trapped in bathroom.
Clevela."

16:26.152 --> 16:28.987
Who in tarnation
is Clevela?!

16:28.989 --> 16:30.922
You know who's good
with puzzles and such?

16:30.924 --> 16:31.990
Cleveland.

16:31.992 --> 16:33.191
I'm gonna go ask him.

16:33.193 --> 16:34.926
You gonna eat that?

16:36.195 --> 16:39.364
Num-num-num-num-num...

16:39.366 --> 16:41.165
LESTER: Cleveland?
You in there?

16:41.167 --> 16:41.933
Cleveland!

16:41.935 --> 16:43.034
(opens door)

16:43.036 --> 16:44.669
You in here,
Cleveland?

16:44.671 --> 16:45.670
Hello...?

16:45.672 --> 16:46.871
(door opens)

16:46.873 --> 16:48.206
Oh, my God, Cleveland!

16:48.208 --> 16:49.807
Do you know
who Clevela is?

16:49.809 --> 16:51.676
She's trapped
in a bathroom, too!

16:53.979 --> 16:56.014
Mr. Brown, stay calm.

16:56.016 --> 16:57.482
We'll have you out of here soon.

16:57.484 --> 17:01.019
Please hurry,
the bowl is almost full.

17:01.021 --> 17:03.354
Step aside!

17:03.356 --> 17:04.856
(gasps)

17:04.858 --> 17:07.358
You're the cranky old
gay sex guy from my basement!

17:07.360 --> 17:09.093
(clears throat)

17:09.095 --> 17:11.562
I'll, uh, need a moment to
assess Mr. Brown's condition.

17:14.333 --> 17:15.533
(whistles)

17:15.535 --> 17:17.168
You built this yourself?

17:17.170 --> 17:18.169
Yeah.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.704
I thought I could help people,

17:19.706 --> 17:24.008
but like a redhead in a <i>Playboy,</i>
<i>I was no help at all.</i>

17:24.010 --> 17:26.477
Hey-- you have helped someone.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.012
You've helped me.

17:29.014 --> 17:31.349
Is that bruise shaped like--

17:31.351 --> 17:32.483
A toilet seat.

17:32.485 --> 17:33.484
That's right.

17:33.486 --> 17:34.852
It wasn't gay sex.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.020
We did everything but.

17:36.022 --> 17:37.922
Then after they left,
I slipped off the toilet,

17:37.924 --> 17:40.525
landed on my back,
and hit my head.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.260
Boy, did I feel stupid.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.162
I was too ashamed
to tell you before,

17:44.164 --> 17:46.831
but seeing you like this
gives me courage.

17:46.833 --> 17:49.667
I'm going to try
to use my toilet again.

17:49.669 --> 17:52.537
Chief, get me
to the state capitol.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.705
It's go time.

17:56.675 --> 17:58.176
Are you sure
you want to do this?

17:58.178 --> 18:00.244
The whole city will see you!

18:00.246 --> 18:01.913
They need to see!

18:01.915 --> 18:03.581
If you had seen this before,

18:03.583 --> 18:06.217
you would've gotten
the help you need!

18:15.094 --> 18:18.429
On the wings of a
porcelain eagle.

18:20.332 --> 18:24.035
Whoa, slow down,
Speed Racer!

18:24.037 --> 18:25.303
Don't.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.471
Just don't.

18:26.473 --> 18:27.705
Uh, Mom?

18:27.707 --> 18:29.207
You need to see this.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.843
REPORTER: ...we are unsure if
this is some form of protest,

18:31.845 --> 18:34.479
but the man is on his way to the
state capitol building...

18:34.481 --> 18:36.347
What is he doing?!

18:36.349 --> 18:38.416
He's on a
flying toilet.

18:38.418 --> 18:41.319
'Cause, you know, that's
something that happens.

18:41.321 --> 18:43.621
NEWS ANCHOR: Onlookers have
reported hearing the man

18:43.623 --> 18:47.959
shout the words "respect"
and "teenage son" and "fat."

18:47.961 --> 18:49.927
But no one seems to know what

18:49.929 --> 18:52.663
this bizarre display could
possibly mean--

18:52.665 --> 18:54.332
I'll tell you
what it means.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.334
That man is risking his life

18:56.336 --> 18:58.803
so that I no longer
need feel ashamed.

18:58.805 --> 19:02.907
Toilet-Related Injury
survivors, raise your hands!

19:04.576 --> 19:06.177
Weird town.

19:06.179 --> 19:09.480
We're going to the capitol
to support Cleveland!

19:09.482 --> 19:11.282
Come on, Carlton!

19:11.284 --> 19:14.986
The name is...
Cleveland Brown, Junior.

19:14.988 --> 19:19.357
I pray to God military jets are
scrambling to shoot him down.

19:20.626 --> 19:23.461
Now, kids, remember
Mama's high-speed chase

19:23.463 --> 19:24.929
that she was totally
exonerated of

19:24.931 --> 19:27.532
because the police officer
filled out the ticket wrong?

19:27.534 --> 19:28.766
Buckle up.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.813
(grunting happily)

19:46.952 --> 19:50.321
(Rallo yells happily,
laughs)

19:50.323 --> 19:56.027
I love my irresponsible mama!

20:11.810 --> 20:13.077
(Rollo yells happily)

20:14.112 --> 20:18.349
RALLO:
<i>I got my picturrrre...!</i>

20:30.028 --> 20:31.996
"...And though my father was
only allowed to speak

20:31.998 --> 20:33.664
"for three minutes
before the committee

20:33.666 --> 20:35.032
"ejected him in disgust...

20:35.034 --> 20:38.769
"and though he was cited
for public indecency...

20:38.771 --> 20:42.506
he showed great courage and
fought for what he believed in."

20:42.508 --> 20:44.775
That's what makes an American.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.811
And that's what makes my dad...

20:46.813 --> 20:48.446
my hero.

20:48.448 --> 20:52.984
Cleveland Brown Jr.,
proud son of Toilet Man.

20:52.986 --> 20:55.152
(cheering)
