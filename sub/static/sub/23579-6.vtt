-Stay with me, Ortega.

01:06.566 --> 01:09.069
-Hey! Hey, I'm talking to you.
-I'm three feet away.

01:11.279 --> 01:13.364
Where is Samir?

01:13.448 --> 01:16.159
Don't worry about him. He's fine.
Just concentrate on staying alive.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.745
-He took the hit for me.

01:22.999 --> 01:25.376
-Sit still or you're losing that sleeve.

01:25.460 --> 01:26.753
-Oh, shit!
-Fuck. Hey, hey. Stay awake! Stay awake!

01:29.547 --> 01:31.090
-Open your eyes!
-I'm so tired.

01:31.174 --> 01:32.258
Hey, talk to me. Talk to me!

01:32.342 --> 01:35.553
Hey, hey, hey! Tell me about Ryker.
Hey, tell me about Elias.

01:35.637 --> 01:39.057
-He had the most open cases on the squad.

01:39.140 --> 01:40.391
Drove me crazy.

01:41.059 --> 01:43.853
Dumb and pretty, huh? Wouldn't have
thought that'd be your type.

01:44.187 --> 01:46.773
He wasn't dumb and you're not that pretty.

01:46.856 --> 01:49.484
Kristen, we're almost there. Almost there.
Hang on. Hey, hang on!

01:57.117 --> 01:59.327
-I need some help here.
-Put her finger on the scanner.

01:59.410 --> 02:02.914
-You need to pay for services.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.253
I'm sorry, but Miss Ortega
has insufficient resources

02:08.336 --> 02:09.462
for specialized treatment.

02:09.546 --> 02:11.756
-Of course not. We don't turn anyone away.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.925
We'll help her as soon as we can.

02:18.179 --> 02:19.639
I um... I just assumed that--

02:19.722 --> 02:21.975
-Yeah.
-Please. Right this way.

02:34.904 --> 02:37.699
Her stack is intact.

02:37.782 --> 02:41.202
The danger is to her sleeve.
Her arm, it's too badly damaged.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.370
We need to amputate.

02:42.453 --> 02:45.456
However, we do offer a wide range
of limb replacement models

02:45.540 --> 02:49.335
for someone with your
considerable financial resources.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.963
These are our most popular options:
biomech, gene-spliced,

02:52.046 --> 02:53.673
cloned, or full mechanical.

02:53.756 --> 02:56.885
Personally, I would recommend
the Jager-Schuster model 16.

02:56.968 --> 02:59.012
Reinforced titanium
mechanical substructure

02:59.095 --> 03:01.806
covered in a neurachem-enhanced
cloned human skin.

03:01.890 --> 03:06.060
Seamless interface with the patient's
nervous and musculoskeletal systems.

03:06.144 --> 03:09.314
And the real selling point:
completely natural-looking.

03:09.397 --> 03:11.149
Truly the best of both worlds.

03:11.649 --> 03:13.818
Any interest in an extended warranty?

03:13.902 --> 03:16.571
Offer me one more thing
and I'll put your head through the wall.

03:19.616 --> 03:22.118
<i>Payment accepted. Congratulations--</i>

03:22.201 --> 03:23.369
Just fix her.

03:29.250 --> 03:33.171
<i>Your father mentioned that my</i>
<i>design sense reminded him of antacid.</i>

03:33.254 --> 03:35.590
<i>I thought we should vary</i>
<i>the color scheme a bit.</i>

03:35.673 --> 03:36.966
<i>I was in the black,</i>

03:37.926 --> 03:40.678
and the monsters turned my insides to red.

03:42.388 --> 03:46.559
I cannot begin to imagine
what was done to you in the real.

03:47.685 --> 03:50.897
But I know something which might help.

03:51.814 --> 03:53.149
Would you like to hit me?

03:54.192 --> 03:55.193
What?

03:56.694 --> 03:58.696
I don't wanna hurt you.

03:58.780 --> 03:59.781
You won't.

03:59.864 --> 04:03.785
Understand that in my making this offer,
I can feel no pain.

04:11.542 --> 04:14.128
It is not our enemies that defeat us.

04:15.588 --> 04:16.923
It is our fear.

04:20.134 --> 04:25.807
Do not be afraid of the monsters,
Miss Elizabeth.

04:30.270 --> 04:34.857
Make them... afraid of you.

04:51.457 --> 04:54.127
Wonderful! Would you like to try again?

04:54.711 --> 04:57.171
You want to get hit, I'll fucking hit you!

04:57.255 --> 04:59.090
You must leave at once.

04:59.173 --> 05:01.134
-Ladybug.
-This is dangerous.

05:01.217 --> 05:02.510
It's me. I'm here.

05:02.593 --> 05:06.597
I was in the forest, Daddy.
It was dark and full of monsters.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.392
-I didn't know--

05:09.475 --> 05:11.602
I screamed and you never came!

05:15.356 --> 05:17.108
What the hell do you think
you were doing?

05:17.191 --> 05:19.110
-I did.

05:19.193 --> 05:21.946
You came in and disturbed her treatment
when she was making progress.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.824
Treatment? You were telling her
to hit you, you sick fuck!

05:24.907 --> 05:27.744
I am teaching her to feel safe again,
defend herself, body and mind.

05:28.202 --> 05:29.871
Vigorous self-defense curriculum,

05:29.954 --> 05:32.332
paired with psycho-surgery
and trauma therapy,

05:32.415 --> 05:35.168
-can be beneficial to survivors--

05:39.339 --> 05:41.341
You're the hotel and the hotel is you,
right?

05:44.385 --> 05:45.470
Can you feel pain?

05:48.056 --> 05:49.223
No.

05:51.267 --> 05:52.518
But I can feel anger.

05:57.065 --> 05:58.107
Come on, Tin Man.

05:58.649 --> 06:00.860
I'm receiving notification
from a local hospital.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.530
Lieutenant Ortega has been injured.

06:05.990 --> 06:06.866
Critically.

06:11.662 --> 06:13.039
We're not done, Poe.

06:26.344 --> 06:27.345
Locals.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.348
Ultimately, they're all expendable.

06:32.183 --> 06:34.852
Kristin isn't.
-First-name basis.

06:34.936 --> 06:36.229
Bad sign.

06:37.021 --> 06:38.481
I didn't say she was--

06:38.564 --> 06:42.193
It's in the details. Don't tell me
you haven't noticed a pattern here.

06:43.444 --> 06:44.821
She's not gonna die.

06:46.322 --> 06:48.407
That will be a change for you.

06:51.661 --> 06:52.995
I won't let it happen.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.916
Not this time, not ever again.

06:56.999 --> 06:58.918
This is what you do, love.

06:59.669 --> 07:04.298
Stride across the centuries,
and death follows, churning in your wake.

07:04.382 --> 07:05.675
That's poetic.

07:07.510 --> 07:10.972
I'm a figment of your tortured psyche,
I say what you're thinking.

07:13.891 --> 07:18.104
A man who never loves
gives no hostage to fortune,

07:18.187 --> 07:19.730
to paraphrase a great scientist.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.902
A man who doesn't love isn't really a man.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.030
To paraphrase you.

07:32.368 --> 07:35.121
Just... sleeve memory...

07:36.581 --> 07:37.999
pheromones.

07:40.251 --> 07:42.128
A ghost that belongs to...

07:42.879 --> 07:44.088
To me?

07:45.047 --> 07:47.258
That isn't who we were to each other, Tak.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.011
Love isn't finite.

07:50.094 --> 07:52.221
Maybe life shouldn't be either. Maybe we should keep living, forever.

07:58.060 --> 08:01.564
Maybe we all fought for nothing,
maybe you died for nothing.

08:13.701 --> 08:14.827
How is she?

08:16.662 --> 08:17.997
She's in surgery.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.583
Son of a bitch practically
tore her arm off.

08:23.669 --> 08:26.631
Your girl seems like a serious badass.
She'll pull through.

08:26.714 --> 08:28.341
-She's not my girl.
-Right.

08:28.424 --> 08:30.801
Wait, surgery? Why don't you just
buy her a new sleeve?

08:31.177 --> 08:33.971
-She grew up Neo-C.

08:34.680 --> 08:35.932
No. She renounced it.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.059
So then she could be
legally resleeved, right?

08:38.142 --> 08:40.853
Doesn't mean she'd want me to.
She'd probably never forgive me.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.190
Not the best time, Poe!

08:44.273 --> 08:47.777
Nor for me. If Elliot is there,
please tell him I'm not speaking to him.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.404
-Look, you tell him yourself!
-<i>Obviously, I cannot.</i>

08:50.488 --> 08:51.364
What do you want?

08:51.447 --> 08:53.199
I have information
that may be time-sensitive.

08:53.282 --> 08:55.826
<i>After searching through</i>
<i>a dizzying number of shell companies</i>

08:55.910 --> 08:58.496
and cover identities,
I found the provenance you requested

08:58.579 --> 09:01.457
for the paintings
in Isaac Bancroft's apartment.

09:01.541 --> 09:05.336
<i>The buyer hails from Volgograd.</i>
<i>He financed the purchases</i>

09:05.419 --> 09:08.881
deploying a shell company
called Ural Syth Co.,

09:08.965 --> 09:12.051
whose real owner is one Sergei Brevlov.

09:12.134 --> 09:15.471
Sergei Brevlov. I know that name.
He was at Bancroft's dinner.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.473
Send me his address.
I'm heading over there now.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.351
So, your girl is being operated on

09:20.434 --> 09:23.896
and you're still investigating for the
bloodsucking Meth. Why do you even care?

09:23.980 --> 09:25.898
I thought we already established that.
I don't.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.942
So Bancroft gets his killer,

09:28.025 --> 09:30.152
you get your freedom,
and nothing else matters?

09:30.236 --> 09:31.320
Sergei was at the party,

09:31.404 --> 09:34.156
so was the Ghostwalker that slagged Abboud
and almost killed Kristin.

09:34.657 --> 09:35.741
You coming?

09:36.367 --> 09:38.869
Sure. Could use something to hit.

09:48.296 --> 09:52.383
Well, this certainly inspires confidence
in Bay City's finest.

09:52.466 --> 09:54.343
I'm a little busy right now, Ms. Prescott.

09:54.427 --> 09:55.803
Not too busy for me.

09:55.886 --> 09:58.472
You have something that belongs
to my client. He wants it back.

09:58.556 --> 10:01.684
You tell your client he can file a request
through the proper channels.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.644
I can see you're having
a bad day, Captain,

10:03.728 --> 10:06.147
so I'm gonna save you from yourself
before you make it worse.

10:06.230 --> 10:08.566
If I have to file anything at all,

10:08.649 --> 10:11.861
Mr. Bancroft will make this
look like a picnic in the park.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.322
You think you've seen blood?
Wait until you see your own.

10:14.405 --> 10:15.948
Metaphorically speaking.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.701
What is it you're here for?

10:18.784 --> 10:20.995
Mr. Bancroft's been informed
you're holding a clone.

10:21.078 --> 10:26.000
It is entirely unacceptable that
any clone of his would be kept, well...

10:26.542 --> 10:28.044
somewhere like this.

10:28.127 --> 10:31.839
Davis, take Ms. Prescott to Evidence
and help her with whatever she needs.

10:31.922 --> 10:34.842
Don't take so long next time, Captain.
My client doesn't like to wait.

10:34.925 --> 10:36.469
Go ahead. She'll catch up.

10:39.639 --> 10:43.309
What is this, a holiday and somebody
forgot to tell me? Get back to work!

10:45.019 --> 10:47.938
You wanna keep that hand?
Don't touch me again. Ever.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.320
You may work for them,
but you're not one of them.

10:54.403 --> 10:57.281
Don't talk to me like that
in front of my people.

10:57.365 --> 11:00.409
You're ground-born, just like me.
We're the same.

11:01.994 --> 11:03.496
Is that what you think?

11:04.205 --> 11:06.165
We're not the same, Captain.

11:06.749 --> 11:09.669
One of us is a powerless puppet
being used by forces

11:09.752 --> 11:11.379
that can't quite be comprehended.

11:12.463 --> 11:13.964
And the other one is me.

11:15.758 --> 11:16.634
What is it?

11:16.717 --> 11:19.136
Found Levine in the basement,
like Abboud.

11:19.220 --> 11:22.598
Stack ripped out and crushed. It's RD'd.

11:25.434 --> 11:26.310
Christ.

11:27.937 --> 11:30.481
There were two attackers.
Why am I only seeing one?

11:30.564 --> 11:32.441
He deleted himself from the system.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.236
The whole fucking system,
which is not possible.

11:35.319 --> 11:39.115
Our tech is designed to be tamperproof.
But, hey, watch this.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.787
-I got a theory. Sort of.

11:44.870 --> 11:48.457
When Ortega went to Bancroft's party,
she might have scanned a few guests.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.042
Yeah, of course she did.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.877
But one of them didn't show up on her ONI.

11:51.961 --> 11:54.672
The way he removes himself from
the footage, deletes himself,

11:54.755 --> 11:56.716
it's similar.
I can't be certain, but it's--

11:56.799 --> 11:58.926
Mickey, I got two dead cops
and one torn to pieces,

11:59.009 --> 12:00.803
so if you got a lead
you'd better be certain.

12:00.886 --> 12:04.640
I think it's the same guy.
The Ghostwalker.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.518
Why the hell am I just hearing
about this now?

12:07.601 --> 12:09.812
What the fuck have you people
been smoking down here? Anything. But that's not the point.
I-- We thought--

12:12.189 --> 12:15.568
Don't think, you hear me?
No more thinking. That's a fucking order.

12:16.277 --> 12:18.404
I'm streaming an arrest notification
on Kadmin,

12:18.487 --> 12:21.782
who, thanks to you, is in that gang sleeve
running around the city.

12:22.658 --> 12:28.038
Captain, when you see Ortega,
will you just tell her that I'm sorry?

12:43.596 --> 12:44.597
Sit.

12:50.060 --> 12:54.315
I suppose I should thank you, Hemingway,
for sending Leung to save my life.

12:54.398 --> 12:58.068
Now I have another chance to kill
that fucking lying murderer.

12:58.152 --> 13:00.446
His name is Kovacs, and he's an Envoy,

13:00.529 --> 13:03.491
-and you are never to go near him again.

13:03.574 --> 13:06.243
Please stop referring to your
double-sleeved copy as your "brother."

13:06.327 --> 13:08.412
It's inaccurate. And I hate inaccuracy.

13:09.079 --> 13:12.666
Two hundred years
we have been working together.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.961
Side by side. Back to back.

13:16.045 --> 13:19.381
In and out of I don't know
how many sleeves.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.592
The only thing we had was each other.

13:21.675 --> 13:24.720
And then this skulljump shows up
and takes him out.

13:24.803 --> 13:27.264
-Loyalty.

13:27.848 --> 13:29.642
I understand it. I respect it.

13:29.725 --> 13:32.561
I have family myself
and I would protect them at any cost.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.605
But this other Dimi was an idiot.

13:35.105 --> 13:38.400
I sent him to pick up Kovacs
at the Raven Hotel and bring him back.

13:38.484 --> 13:39.860
That is all he had to do.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.196
Instead, he allowed his temper
to get the best of him,

13:42.279 --> 13:44.448
and he picked a fight
with a trigger-happy AI

13:44.532 --> 13:46.784
and ended up getting killed.
Very publicly.

13:46.867 --> 13:49.912
I want my revenge. My brother--

13:49.995 --> 13:52.873
-Your copy.
-I want Kovacs dead!

13:55.876 --> 13:58.170
Then you are destined for disappointment.

14:00.756 --> 14:01.799
One moment, please.

14:08.430 --> 14:12.768
If you dare to interrupt his backup cycle,
I will end you. Painfully.

14:19.441 --> 14:22.194
I need Mr. Kovacs to remain alive.

14:22.278 --> 14:24.947
The reasons behind that are none
of your business or your concern.

14:25.030 --> 14:28.826
All that matters is that you understand
that you are not to touch him.

14:28.909 --> 14:32.246
You have so accurately pointed out
that the other one of you is dead, so you need to think very carefully
about what you want to do next.

14:36.083 --> 14:38.627
Your copy allowed his emotions
to dictate his actions

14:38.711 --> 14:40.838
and ended up getting scattered
across the lobby.

14:40.921 --> 14:43.674
So whatever family honor
you believe that you are owed

14:43.757 --> 14:48.220
inside that scrambled multi-sleeved mess
that you call a mind is over.

14:49.221 --> 14:53.017
Mr. Leung will take you to one
of our safe houses where you'll remain

14:53.100 --> 14:55.728
until the larger situation is resolved.

15:16.540 --> 15:19.418
What the hell? You could have knocked.

15:20.127 --> 15:22.796
I know you. You're Laurens' Envoy.

15:23.213 --> 15:26.425
You funneled money to Isaac
by buying artwork through a shell company.

15:26.508 --> 15:29.303
A lot of money. Going on the run
kind of money. Where is he?

15:29.386 --> 15:31.055
-I don't know.
-Get down!

15:39.897 --> 15:42.107
You were pretending to be your father
for the Osaka deal.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.234
I have no idea what you're talking about.

15:44.318 --> 15:47.446
You're gonna pay when my dad finds out
you laid a hand on me.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.615
You and your waiter friend.

15:49.698 --> 15:52.868
I'm not a waiter.
And I never laid a hand on you.

15:55.746 --> 15:57.706
Now I laid a hand on you.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.292
Do you understand who I am?

16:00.376 --> 16:03.212
I know exactly who you are
and who you murdered.

16:03.879 --> 16:06.131
What

16:06.715 --> 16:09.259
Look, you're crazy, okay?
You're both crazy!

16:09.343 --> 16:12.346
-I don't know anyone named Dimi.

16:12.429 --> 16:13.973
Let him go. He didn't do anything.

16:14.056 --> 16:15.766
You even know how to use that thing?

16:16.850 --> 16:18.727
-Yeah, he knows how to use it.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.730
No! Look, shoot me, okay?

16:21.814 --> 16:24.274
I'll do whatever you want.
Just leave him alone.

16:26.318 --> 16:28.529
You are accusing my son of murder?

16:28.612 --> 16:31.615
Just giving your husband
information about the 48 hours he lost.

16:31.699 --> 16:34.159
You had no right to speak with Isaac.
He has nothing to do with this.

16:34.243 --> 16:35.202
Miriam.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.788
What information, precisely?

16:37.871 --> 16:40.791
You cast back from Osaka,
you went to Fightdrome.

16:40.874 --> 16:43.460
You saw Isaac there,
exchanged a few words with him,

16:43.544 --> 16:45.713
and then you beat him
within an inch of his life.

16:45.796 --> 16:48.007
-Probably because he was running around

16:48.090 --> 16:50.426
sleeved in that clone,
pretending to be you.

16:50.926 --> 16:52.761
My apologies, Mr. Bancroft.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.514
Forgive me, I thought
you'd want to see the... your...

16:55.597 --> 16:57.725
the asset right away.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.894
-We can come back.
-Oh, no. It's all right, Oumou.

17:00.978 --> 17:03.063
Thank you, Curtis. You can go.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.606
Oumou, you stay.

17:04.690 --> 17:09.611
-I don't want to intrude.

17:12.114 --> 17:13.532
I should wait outside.

17:15.325 --> 17:17.911
Yeah. Probably a good idea.

17:22.124 --> 17:23.292
So it's true, huh?

17:25.753 --> 17:29.214
Thought you could impersonate me?
You could replace me?

17:29.298 --> 17:31.175
Make me just...

17:31.258 --> 17:32.551
...disappear forever?

17:32.634 --> 17:35.596
-No. That's not what it was.

17:36.180 --> 17:37.222
Dad...

17:37.306 --> 17:41.226
How far will you go with this until
you realize how completely unjust it is?

17:41.310 --> 17:44.605
-You refuse to see the--
-Shut your mouth.

17:44.688 --> 17:46.815
Dad, I wanted you to see what I could do,

17:46.899 --> 17:50.444
realize that I'm not a rich,
spoiled fuckup.

17:50.527 --> 17:53.572
I wanted to show you
you don't have to be disappointed in me.

17:53.655 --> 17:58.243
You should be proud of how you raised me,
of the man that I've become.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.413
I should destroy your backups.

18:01.914 --> 18:05.000
-I should just erase you.
-You leave him alone.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.336
He's like this because you've coddled him.

18:07.419 --> 18:10.130
He's our son.
No, he is a grown man.

18:10.756 --> 18:14.635
Shouldn't need his ass wiped every time
he makes a fuckup of things.

18:14.718 --> 18:17.221
You did this. You did this to him.

18:17.304 --> 18:20.933
You kept him from having a chance
to become himself in life.

18:21.016 --> 18:21.975
He didn't do it.

18:23.977 --> 18:26.271
-Isaac didn't do it.

18:26.355 --> 18:30.025
It takes a deep kind of despair
for a son to kill his father. It's...

18:31.235 --> 18:34.238
<i>a kind of rage that you can't escape from.</i>

18:35.489 --> 18:37.157
-He doesn't have it.
He's right.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.702
Isaac couldn't have hurt anyone,
he was with me.

18:40.786 --> 18:43.831
I took him to a grounder hospital
after you beat him. No records.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.124
Why didn't you say this before?

18:45.207 --> 18:47.084
Because you shouldn't
have to be told, Laurens,

18:47.167 --> 18:50.587
by me or him or anyone,
the kind of man your son is.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.798
How could you believe
that I would shoot you?

18:53.632 --> 18:58.137
All that I have ever wanted
was to prove myself to you.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.348
I don't want you dead, Dad.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.143
I want your respect.

19:13.110 --> 19:15.779
You know, it's a father's duty to...

19:17.322 --> 19:20.450
be sure their children
have a fighting chance in the world.

19:20.534 --> 19:26.874
But sometimes... sometimes
regardless of how much one would hope,

19:26.957 --> 19:29.710
the apple falls far, far from the tree.

19:34.506 --> 19:36.049
Don't you touch him.

20:13.503 --> 20:15.088
Thank you for the update.

20:17.424 --> 20:18.800
Very good work.

20:20.302 --> 20:22.387
I look forward to the next one.

20:39.363 --> 20:43.200
Still want to be one of them?

20:44.451 --> 20:45.744
I have what it takes.

20:52.668 --> 20:55.545
You know him? He was at Bancroft's party.

20:56.672 --> 20:57.673
No.

21:08.183 --> 21:10.435
Why do you take orders from him?

21:10.519 --> 21:12.396
I take orders from no one.

21:12.479 --> 21:14.898
I serve only as the right hand
in a holy cause.

21:14.982 --> 21:17.484
You make it sound
like you're a priest.

21:17.567 --> 21:20.654
If we do not know our role
in this world, why are we in it?

21:21.280 --> 21:23.282
I cannot speak for you, my friend,

21:23.365 --> 21:26.159
but I am here to kick
great amounts of ass.

21:26.743 --> 21:28.036
Call it what you like.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.622
You are an attack dog
on another man's leash.

21:30.706 --> 21:35.043
I make my own way.
I'm not a tool for someone else to use.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.462
A pawn in the army of the righteous

21:37.546 --> 21:41.633
can be more powerful
than a king who is without faith.

21:42.342 --> 21:44.553
Me, I prefer checkers.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.888
This does not surprise me.

21:47.639 --> 21:50.642
Tell me, are you a believer?

21:59.109 --> 22:00.152
Bitch!

22:51.369 --> 22:54.164
The offer you made to me,
I've reconsidered.

22:54.247 --> 22:57.751
With one condition.
I need an extraction now.

23:00.420 --> 23:04.925
Fine, fine, fine. We have a deal.
Transmitting coordinates now.

23:26.363 --> 23:29.282
Looking forward to working with you,
Mr. Kadmin.

23:53.807 --> 23:56.184
Aah!

23:57.853 --> 23:59.062
I barely know him.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.482
I'm going for a coffee.

24:05.527 --> 24:08.238
That went better than
you have any right to expect.

24:12.200 --> 24:16.538
This looks pretty good. Like, "Hallelujah,
it's a fucking miracle" level good.

24:37.184 --> 24:38.268
Hey.

24:40.103 --> 24:41.479
Elias?

25:03.752 --> 25:04.920
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.380
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where do you think you're going?

25:07.464 --> 25:10.300
Isaac was a dead end.
I got work to do. So move.

25:10.383 --> 25:11.551
Or what?

25:11.635 --> 25:12.802
Okay, I already know what,

25:12.886 --> 25:15.764
but before you put my head through a wall,
just hear me out.

25:15.847 --> 25:17.307
Keep your voice down.

25:18.683 --> 25:20.518
I'm not the person she wants there.

25:21.144 --> 25:24.773
Maybe. But you're the person who's here.

25:26.233 --> 25:27.692
So you stay.

25:54.344 --> 25:55.595
-Hey.
-Hey.

25:59.015 --> 26:01.601
-You might wanna take it slow there.

26:01.685 --> 26:03.728
It's okay, I'm just a little sore.

26:04.854 --> 26:08.650
Which is weird, I thought
I was gonna wake up in pieces.

26:11.111 --> 26:12.529
How is Samir?

26:18.994 --> 26:21.746
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

26:21.830 --> 26:24.958
You said he was all right.
You told me he was fine.

26:25.041 --> 26:27.168
You told me not to worry.
You said he was fine.

26:27.252 --> 26:28.378
He didn't make it.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.338
Real death.

26:39.806 --> 26:41.057
You lied to me.

26:41.516 --> 26:44.311
You were dying and there wasn't
anything you could have done.

26:44.394 --> 26:46.563
You lied to me!

26:47.856 --> 26:51.192
What the fuck?
-So, about the arm--

26:51.276 --> 26:54.779
I'm unconscious for ten fucking minutes
and you start replacing my body parts?

26:54.863 --> 26:56.489
Was either replace the arm
or lose the sleeve.

26:56.573 --> 26:58.783
And that's the best
Bancroft money can buy.

26:58.867 --> 27:01.161
Anything else you told them
to change out while I was under?

27:01.244 --> 27:02.662
Since you were doing renovations.

27:02.746 --> 27:05.540
-No, everything else was great.

27:05.623 --> 27:09.377
State of the art. You can use it
to bash my face in if you want.

27:09.461 --> 27:12.756
-Give you an Ortega family bulk deal.
-Don't tempt me.

27:14.716 --> 27:17.761
-Oh, please. Interrupt.

27:17.844 --> 27:19.054
Yeah, come in.

27:22.641 --> 27:23.600
Yeah.

27:24.100 --> 27:26.936
-Apparently replaceable.

27:27.020 --> 27:30.315
Is he okay?
-Don't worry about Mickey. He's fine.

27:30.398 --> 27:32.817
He's on the case. How are you?

27:35.028 --> 27:36.196
Alive.

27:37.822 --> 27:39.199
Samir was a hero, Kristin.

27:39.282 --> 27:41.618
I saw the footage.
He died saving your life.

27:41.993 --> 27:43.662
I'm putting in a recommendation for him.

27:43.745 --> 27:46.623
The Medal of Valor. He'll be on the wall
alongside your father.

27:46.706 --> 27:49.376
-He told me to stop the Ryker case--
-Don't do this.

27:49.459 --> 27:51.628
-This is my fucking fault.
-You can't blame yourself.

27:51.711 --> 27:53.088
Nice flowers.

27:53.505 --> 27:56.716
So Mickey... Mickey's not suspended?

27:56.800 --> 27:59.094
No, of course not. Why would he be?

28:00.470 --> 28:02.013
Really nice flowers.

28:02.097 --> 28:05.100
-Really nice, expensive flowers.

28:05.183 --> 28:07.477
Forgive me for being sorry for her loss.

28:07.560 --> 28:09.521
It's too much.
You're asking for forgiveness.

28:09.604 --> 28:11.147
Which makes me wonder for what.

28:11.231 --> 28:13.233
You son of a bitch,
let's take this outside.

28:13.316 --> 28:15.527
And Mickey's "on the case"?

28:15.610 --> 28:18.613
He shouldn't be in the fucking building.
He lied to you.

28:18.696 --> 28:20.031
So why is he still employed?

28:20.115 --> 28:22.826
Maybe because if you suspend him,
there'd be an investigation,

28:22.909 --> 28:25.036
and you'd have to document
what he was hiding from you.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.122
Someone doesn't want
that information out in the world,

28:27.205 --> 28:29.249
so you're keeping it quiet.

28:29.332 --> 28:31.501
But you're here. You're concerned.

28:31.584 --> 28:33.211
You brought the bouquet of guilt.

28:33.294 --> 28:35.505
You clearly didn't expect the attack,

28:35.588 --> 28:37.882
-which means they don't own you.

28:37.966 --> 28:41.094
They just pay you to look the other way
from time to time.

28:46.975 --> 28:48.852
No one was supposed to get hurt.

28:50.937 --> 28:52.272
Could you give us a minute?

28:53.231 --> 28:54.649
Take as many as you need.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.704
I trusted you. My father trusted you.

29:07.787 --> 29:09.122
Samir trusted you!

29:09.205 --> 29:11.666
Look at where we are.
Why your sleeve is even alive.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.084
Meth money.

29:13.168 --> 29:15.879
Do you really think we have any power?
The police? We're nothing.

29:15.962 --> 29:17.839
The best we can do is keep our heads down,

29:17.922 --> 29:21.342
do a little good when we can.
We are not going to change anything.

29:21.426 --> 29:25.221
So you let cop-killers into the station
because you're a victim of society?

29:25.305 --> 29:26.890
-I didn't let them in.

29:26.973 --> 29:29.684
-I didn't know anything about it!
-Not convinced.

29:33.438 --> 29:34.272
I just...

29:36.065 --> 29:38.693
I just take a few credits on the side
to keep him in the loop,

29:38.777 --> 29:41.654
to keep him informed about what's
going on at the station. That's all.

29:42.489 --> 29:43.948
Who do you talk to

29:44.032 --> 29:47.535
I don't know.
I've never actually seen his face.

29:47.952 --> 29:52.582
I ping him on a burner, and we meet
at a cheap VR cafe in Oakland.

29:56.002 --> 29:57.128
Ping him.

29:57.587 --> 29:59.714
-And send me the address.
-All right.

29:59.798 --> 30:00.757
Now!

30:01.424 --> 30:02.300
Yeah.

30:07.430 --> 30:09.724
He gave me what I wanted
and I let him live.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.976
Where the fuck are my clothes?

30:12.060 --> 30:12.894
Let's go.

30:30.578 --> 30:32.163
I'd like to buy some time.

30:35.083 --> 30:39.629
Pay by the minute, credits up front.
Low-rez only.

30:49.430 --> 30:52.267
There's no ID on the VR address
Tanaka gave me.

30:52.600 --> 30:54.310
We're going into the pipe blind.

30:54.394 --> 30:56.688
All right, patch me in.
-No. I go in.

30:56.771 --> 31:01.067
Look... there's an Envoy thing
called controlling the construct.

31:01.150 --> 31:05.405
I can modulate the system to make
myself look like Tanaka. So just...

31:06.364 --> 31:08.283
I hate it when you're smug.

31:11.369 --> 31:16.165
Pay by the minute, credits up front.
Low-rez only.

31:18.167 --> 31:23.172
Hey. I'll find out who he is. For Abboud.

31:38.771 --> 31:42.275
What's so urgent
that it couldn't wait?

31:42.650 --> 31:44.694
You heard what happened at Fell Street?

31:45.612 --> 31:48.698
Unfortunate casualties,
but the results were achieved.

31:49.574 --> 31:52.911
I never agreed to this.
Not anything like this.

31:52.994 --> 31:54.621
I want a meeting in the real.

31:54.704 --> 31:58.041
I want to speak face to face with you
and I want an explanation.

31:58.958 --> 32:01.419
You know the terms
of this arrangement.

32:07.008 --> 32:09.177
You're not Tanaka. Who are you?

32:12.180 --> 32:16.017
Of course I am. Who else could I be?

32:18.978 --> 32:20.313
Takeshi, is that you?

32:28.529 --> 32:31.199
-I don't hear anything.
-Exactly. Come on.

32:51.636 --> 32:56.224
I've been thinking that's fucking enough.

32:57.141 --> 32:58.309
Move!

33:29.674 --> 33:32.677
Hello again, Lieutenant. And Mr. Kovacs.

33:32.760 --> 33:35.471
Nothing quite like a familiar face,
is there?

33:35.555 --> 33:38.641
It's impossible not to see the person
you once were.

33:38.725 --> 33:42.437
Like an afterimage
burned onto living flesh.

33:43.187 --> 33:45.690
This used to be your sleeve, yes?

33:46.024 --> 33:48.443
That has added value to me.

33:48.526 --> 33:52.864
What would it feel like, dying at my hand,

33:52.947 --> 33:55.658
your hand

33:56.993 --> 33:58.786
-You sick son of a bitch.

33:58.870 --> 34:01.330
Dimi. We're gonna fucking
erase you, Kadmin.

34:01.414 --> 34:02.707
But not today.

34:02.790 --> 34:04.125
What the fuck do you want?

34:06.377 --> 34:09.797
You RD'd my brother
and now I have to replace him.

34:09.881 --> 34:13.843
A mind for a mind.
Double-sleeving, it's not cheap.

34:15.386 --> 34:16.971
You owe me, Kovacs.

34:17.055 --> 34:19.098
-Oh, I'm gonna pay you back.

34:20.725 --> 34:23.895
-It's time.
-Carnage.

34:23.978 --> 34:28.316
I can't have you telling people
the Panama Rose isn't what I claim it is.

34:28.399 --> 34:30.777
Never threaten a man's profit margin.

34:31.194 --> 34:33.237
Let her go. You only need me.

34:33.321 --> 34:36.199
They're paying for a love story.
You and your girl die together.

34:36.574 --> 34:40.495
-She's not my girl.
-I'm not his girl. I don't even like him.

34:40.828 --> 34:41.996
Thanks.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.791
Seems like a lot of people don't like him.

34:44.874 --> 34:49.253
Ryker! Ryker!
Ryker! Ryker! Ryker!

34:59.305 --> 35:01.349
I'm not fucking Ryker.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.352
They don't know that!

35:09.524 --> 35:10.983
Ryker! Ryker!

35:17.824 --> 35:22.578
Ladies and gentlemen!

35:22.662 --> 35:25.832
Welcome to Fightdrome!

35:27.208 --> 35:33.756
Tonight, we bring you a very special,
very exclusive Fightdrome event.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.842
One time, and one time only,

35:35.925 --> 35:40.096
you alone in this room
with the man who has hurt you

35:40.179 --> 35:42.765
and those that you love.

35:42.849 --> 35:47.395
And so tonight, you will see
the love of his life hurt,

35:47.478 --> 35:52.942
her stack cut from her sleeve,
her very soul destroyed!

35:53.025 --> 35:57.697
All in front of this monster's eyes!

35:57.780 --> 36:04.370
You will see the final
and the most terrible humiliation of

36:04.453 --> 36:09.167
Elias Ryker!

36:14.964 --> 36:17.133
Remember my brother, motherfucker?

36:19.343 --> 36:20.845
Ryker was a real charmer.

36:20.928 --> 36:23.055
And you make friends wherever you go.

36:24.765 --> 36:29.979
For this is a love story...
with a body count!

36:32.315 --> 36:36.652
Real blood, real pain, real death!

36:43.951 --> 36:45.286
Not good.

37:11.979 --> 37:13.231
What the...?

37:36.379 --> 37:37.672
Ortega!

37:56.565 --> 37:57.692
Kill them!

38:00.987 --> 38:03.572
I think we're a hit.

38:16.627 --> 38:19.046
Right now,
I bet you're starting to wonder,

38:19.130 --> 38:21.173
"Why didn't he open my artery?"

38:25.678 --> 38:27.054
Huh

38:34.103 --> 38:36.022
"Why didn't he take my arm off?"

38:41.652 --> 38:42.987
"Is his aim off?

38:44.655 --> 38:46.324
Am I that lucky?"

38:47.658 --> 38:51.620
"Or are his blades laced with Reaper?"

38:53.122 --> 38:55.458
Just a taste.

38:57.585 --> 39:01.881
Real death! Real death!

39:32.536 --> 39:35.164
-I'm not even trying.

40:02.483 --> 40:07.696
I'm going to cut her apart
piece by piece, okay?

40:07.780 --> 40:09.782
Kill! Kill! Kill!

40:27.508 --> 40:29.385
Die!

41:08.007 --> 41:09.467
Kovacs, I...

41:09.800 --> 41:11.802
I really like my new arm.

41:14.430 --> 41:15.973
Kill them both! Now!

41:36.202 --> 41:37.870
Close the gates!
