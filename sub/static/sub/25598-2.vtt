WEBVTT

00:00.061 --> 00:01.115
<i>Previously on "Suits"...</i>

00:01.116 --> 00:03.772
As of this morning,
we're merging with Robert Zane.

00:03.798 --> 00:05.262
When I came over,
you said my name

00:05.263 --> 00:06.451
would be the one to go up next.

00:06.452 --> 00:08.439
You have my word.
Your name goes up next.

00:08.440 --> 00:10.267
I threw away my diaphragm.

00:10.268 --> 00:13.179
- You're pulling the goalie?
- Yes, Louis, I am.

00:13.180 --> 00:15.480
I need you to get
Robert Zane's biggest client

00:15.516 --> 00:16.957
to sell their
manufacturing division.

00:16.984 --> 00:19.451
This is going to determine
who runs the firm.

00:19.486 --> 00:21.031
I need you to come through
for me on this one.

00:21.055 --> 00:24.289
Your client is dropping
their manufacturing division,

00:24.325 --> 00:25.835
and we can get back to the
business of running this firm

00:25.859 --> 00:27.526
under the direction
of Robert Zane.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.161
You think I can't take
Samantha Wheeler?

00:29.196 --> 00:30.823
I think you said
you'd stay out of it,

00:30.824 --> 00:32.764
and I'm not going to help you
tell your own team

00:32.765 --> 00:33.743
that you'll cut them out

00:33.744 --> 00:35.576
just to get the better
of Samantha Wheeler.

00:35.612 --> 00:38.012
I did what you asked, and
now I have something to ask.

00:38.048 --> 00:39.647
- What's that?
- You know what I want.

00:39.683 --> 00:41.549
- Samantha.
- Robert, I want name partner,

00:41.584 --> 00:43.351
and I want it
before the year is out.

00:43.386 --> 00:44.819
You said
that I should come back

00:44.854 --> 00:46.654
when I was ready to admit
that you were right.

00:46.690 --> 00:49.257
Takes a big man
to admit that, Harvey.

00:49.292 --> 00:50.758
- My office.
- What about it?

00:50.794 --> 00:52.660
- I want it back.
- Your fearless leader

00:52.696 --> 00:55.129
is happy to comply.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:23.093 --> 01:26.828
- Sheila, what is all this?
- A power breakfast.

01:26.863 --> 01:28.663
And it looks delicious,

01:28.698 --> 01:30.777
but you know I usually like to
eat light in the morning.

01:30.801 --> 01:35.003
Just a bowl of Fiber One, or--
- Oh, I know, Louis.

01:35.038 --> 01:38.373
I also know the day
you take control of the firm

01:38.408 --> 01:39.941
is no usual day.

01:39.976 --> 01:41.976
Before I take control
of what now?

01:42.012 --> 01:44.779
Louis, you just merged,
which means it's time

01:44.815 --> 01:47.449
for a new king
to claim the throne.

01:47.484 --> 01:49.662
All right, Sheila, if you're
saying what I think you are,

01:49.686 --> 01:51.653
Harvey's already
managing partner,

01:51.688 --> 01:54.030
and Zane's going to fight
to take it from him.

01:54.031 --> 01:57.891
Which sets the table for you
to take it from both of them.

01:57.892 --> 02:01.293
Louis, you're a king.

02:01.329 --> 02:05.731
And we should all
be kissing your ring.

02:05.766 --> 02:08.100
But, Sheila,
where is all this coming from?

02:08.136 --> 02:10.603
It's coming from the fact
that Harvey left you

02:10.638 --> 02:13.873
to fight off the hordes,
and you did just that

02:13.908 --> 02:16.542
by subjugating the army
of Robert Zane.

02:16.577 --> 02:18.444
- I suppose I did.
- No supposing, Louis.

02:18.479 --> 02:21.413
You're a god.
A Viking god.

02:21.449 --> 02:23.849
And Viking gods
take what they want.

02:23.885 --> 02:26.285
Now go in there,
and claim what's yours.

02:26.320 --> 02:29.155
I will, but not until
I claim what's also mine--

02:29.774 --> 02:31.073
Not yet.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.676
Let's do it this afternoon,
afterward.

02:33.711 --> 02:37.379
Then we can play
"managing partner/secretary."

02:37.415 --> 02:38.892
In that case you'd better
be ready to take

02:38.916 --> 02:41.617
a whole lot of dictation.

02:41.652 --> 02:43.886
Oh, I will.
Now go.

02:43.921 --> 02:46.756
And return to me a king.
- I know.

03:08.452 --> 03:12.320
- Morning, Robert.
- Harvey, I just got in.

03:12.356 --> 03:16.091
The sign looks good.
- Good, I'm glad you liked it.

03:16.126 --> 03:18.260
You ready to do this thing?

03:18.295 --> 03:20.128
If you mean,
am I ready to get back to being

03:20.164 --> 03:22.097
a managing partner,
I sure as hell am.

03:22.132 --> 03:23.765
Then give me
your John Hancock,

03:23.801 --> 03:26.435
I'll get it to Louis,
and you will officially be

03:26.470 --> 03:29.438
the managing partner
by the end of the day.

03:30.474 --> 03:32.708
Harvey Specter?

03:32.743 --> 03:35.377
That's right, this is
my partner, Robert Zane.

03:35.412 --> 03:37.179
My partner and I
were clients of Mike Ross.

03:37.214 --> 03:40.582
We founded Pod Space.
- You must be Max Louden.

03:40.617 --> 03:42.384
How do you know I'm not Nick?

03:42.419 --> 03:45.087
Because Mike said if one
of you ever came to see me,

03:45.122 --> 03:46.122
it'd be you.

03:46.156 --> 03:48.957
So why don't you tell me
what the problem is,

03:48.992 --> 03:50.258
and I'll get you out of it.

03:50.294 --> 03:52.861
Oh, I hope it's that easy.

03:52.896 --> 03:55.130
Nick and I started
another business venture.

03:55.165 --> 03:58.166
Raised 100 million to
get the thing off the ground.

03:58.657 --> 04:00.256
I can only account
for 50 of it.

04:00.292 --> 04:01.858
Well, when 50 million
is missing,

04:01.893 --> 04:03.760
the math adds up
to embezzlement.

04:03.795 --> 04:06.429
I know that, but I'm telling
you, Nick wouldn't do that.

04:06.464 --> 04:08.031
Not to me,
and not to the business.

04:08.066 --> 04:09.632
Then if he didn't take it,
he got taken.

04:09.668 --> 04:11.601
Look, I don't know
what happened.

04:11.636 --> 04:14.270
But what I do know is that if
we can't account for the money,

04:14.306 --> 04:16.906
and anyone finds out,
we're not just out of business;

04:16.942 --> 04:19.175
we're in prison.
- Trust me, Max.

04:19.211 --> 04:21.244
I'm not going
to let that happen.

04:21.279 --> 04:23.046
Thank you.

04:25.359 --> 04:26.692
And, Max,

04:26.728 --> 04:29.495
don't tell Nick
you came to me with this.

04:29.530 --> 04:33.365
Well, I wasn't going to, but
do you mind if I ask why not?

04:33.401 --> 04:35.101
I don't want him
to know I'm coming.

04:38.864 --> 04:41.398
I know you already know this,
but he's either guilty

04:41.433 --> 04:42.477
and trying
to pin it on his partner,

04:42.501 --> 04:43.300
or it's the other way around.

04:43.335 --> 04:44.835
No way that kid's guilty.

04:44.870 --> 04:46.314
I don't know that,
and neither do you.

04:46.338 --> 04:47.838
I know you're
managing partner,

04:47.873 --> 04:50.407
but you handle your clients,
and I'll handle mine.

04:50.442 --> 04:53.510
Hey, fair enough, but just
to be clear, we just merged.

04:53.545 --> 04:55.645
We need to keep
every client we've got.

04:55.681 --> 04:57.314
Like I said, Robert.

04:57.349 --> 05:00.450
You handle your clients,
I'll handle mine.

05:05.470 --> 05:06.328
I've got an assignment
for you.

05:06.329 --> 05:08.130
Oh, good morning, Robert.
You look nice today too.

05:08.131 --> 05:09.864
Hey, you get to work on time,

05:09.900 --> 05:11.077
I'll tell you that necklace
is pretty all you want.

05:11.101 --> 05:12.033
Right now, I need you
to look into

05:12.069 --> 05:13.309
one of
Harvey Specter's clients.

05:13.337 --> 05:16.104
Let me get this straight.
I just finished tussling

05:16.139 --> 05:18.473
with the guy over sticking my
nose into one of his clients,

05:18.508 --> 05:19.941
and now you want me
to stick my nose

05:19.977 --> 05:21.710
into another one
of his clients?

05:21.745 --> 05:24.646
Samantha,
the man needs your help.

05:24.681 --> 05:25.992
And besides,
he's already seen the bad.

05:26.016 --> 05:27.160
It's time to show him the good.

05:27.184 --> 05:29.351
And again,
what exactly is the good

05:29.386 --> 05:30.819
of me horning in
on his territory?

05:30.854 --> 05:32.721
The good is for the firm.

05:32.756 --> 05:35.457
He may not see it now,
but he will.

05:35.492 --> 05:38.833
- Okay, give it to me.
- He's got two young bucks.

05:38.834 --> 05:40.328
One of them
is up to something shady.

05:40.364 --> 05:42.430
I don't know which one,
but he has a soft spot

05:42.466 --> 05:44.099
for the one named Max.

05:44.515 --> 05:46.615
If that guy's wrong,
he's not going to see it.

05:46.650 --> 05:48.528
And no matter what, we can't
afford to lose the client,

05:48.552 --> 05:50.819
because we just merged.
- Exactly.

05:50.855 --> 05:52.688
I knew I keep you around
for a reason.

05:52.723 --> 05:54.289
That you do.

05:54.325 --> 05:57.059
Now, what's the
"something shady"?

05:57.094 --> 06:00.062
- $50 million is missing.
- Ooh, that sounds fun.

06:00.097 --> 06:01.330
So you're on it?

06:01.365 --> 06:02.509
Oh, I'm more
than on it, Robert.

06:02.533 --> 06:03.882
I know exactly what to do.

- Hi, you must be Donna, I--
- Let me guess.

06:46.281 --> 06:47.948
- Samantha Wheeler.
- What gave it away?

06:47.983 --> 06:49.394
Several things,
not the least of which is you

06:49.418 --> 06:50.984
ambushing me in my office.

06:51.019 --> 06:52.230
Well, it doesn't
have to be an ambush.

06:52.254 --> 06:53.920
It could just be
a friendly howdy-doo.

06:53.956 --> 06:55.633
In that case,
let me grab my ten-gallon hat,

06:55.657 --> 06:57.124
and help make it that.

06:57.159 --> 06:58.425
You don't need
a ten-gallon hat.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.393
You just need
to sign off on this.

07:02.097 --> 07:03.964
Samantha,
this isn't a howdy-doo.

07:03.999 --> 07:05.143
This is
an expense account request

07:05.167 --> 07:07.267
three times larger
than anyone else's.

07:07.302 --> 07:09.102
Huh, it was only
two times bigger

07:09.138 --> 07:11.004
than anyone else's
at Rand Kaldor Zane.

07:11.039 --> 07:13.405
- Try four times bigger.
- How do you know that?

07:13.406 --> 07:15.473
Because it's my business
to know that.

07:15.509 --> 07:18.309
And what I know about this is
that I can't sign off on it.

07:18.345 --> 07:19.944
Is it because
I didn't say please?

07:19.980 --> 07:21.613
It's because
I don't know that it's for.

07:21.648 --> 07:24.346
- It's for me to do my job.
- That isn't very specific.

07:24.347 --> 07:26.235
No, it's not,
but it's what I had before,

07:26.236 --> 07:27.154
and it's what I need now.

07:27.155 --> 07:29.287
If you want specifics,
talk to Robert Zane.

07:29.322 --> 07:30.562
But he doesn't
have any, either,

07:30.590 --> 07:31.923
which is how he prefers it.

07:31.958 --> 07:34.359
Well, I'm not Robert.

07:34.394 --> 07:36.861
But since I'm also not trying
to get off on the wrong foot,

07:36.897 --> 07:40.782
I will authorize half of this,
which is the most we give.

07:40.783 --> 07:42.382
I get it.

07:42.418 --> 07:44.162
The new girl comes in,
and you want to make sure

07:44.186 --> 07:46.219
she understands
the pecking order.

07:46.255 --> 07:49.022
That wasn't my intention.

07:49.058 --> 07:50.301
But if that's
the way you see it,

07:50.325 --> 07:51.436
that tells me
a lot more about you

07:51.460 --> 07:52.826
than it tells you about me.

07:54.997 --> 07:56.363
Good to finally meet you,
Samantha.

07:56.398 --> 07:58.832
Good to meet you too, Donna.

08:03.835 --> 08:06.500
- Harvey, good, you're here.
- I am, but not for long.

08:06.501 --> 08:07.433
I have to
take care of something

08:07.468 --> 08:08.612
for one of Mike's old clients.

08:08.636 --> 08:10.620
That's fine,
but I need to talk to you now.

08:10.621 --> 08:11.595
You may not like
what I have to say--

08:11.596 --> 08:13.573
Oh, I almost forgot.
Robert and I signed the papers

08:13.597 --> 08:15.405
for him to take over
as managing partner.

08:15.406 --> 08:16.772
They're on my desk.
- You what?

08:16.807 --> 08:18.540
I know, I wouldn't
have thought it, either,

08:18.575 --> 08:21.009
but as it turns out, I'd rather
not be managing partner.

08:21.045 --> 08:22.589
- That's not what I--
- Hey, Louis, do me a favor.

08:22.613 --> 08:24.391
Sign the papers and drop
them off to Donna, will you?

08:24.415 --> 08:26.682
I think it's important that
we do it as soon as possible

08:26.717 --> 08:28.350
to show Zane the support

08:28.385 --> 08:29.996
that I would have wanted
if it would have been me.

08:30.020 --> 08:31.460
Of course, if it
would have been you.

08:31.488 --> 08:33.789
- Thanks, Louis.
- No problem, Harvey.

08:33.823 --> 08:36.390
I'll get that off to Donna
as soon as I can.

08:40.393 --> 08:42.493
- Nick Turner?
- Yes.

08:42.528 --> 08:44.227
- Harvey Specter.
- Mr. Specter.

08:44.263 --> 08:45.663
It's a pleasure meeting you,

08:45.698 --> 08:46.630
but I wasn't aware
we had a meeting.

08:46.666 --> 08:48.733
We don't.
I know we've never met,

08:48.768 --> 08:50.034
but you meant a lot to Mike,

08:50.069 --> 08:51.802
which means
you mean a lot to me,

08:51.838 --> 08:53.804
and I just got a proposal
on your behalf.

08:53.840 --> 08:56.474
Smith Barney
wants to take you public.

08:56.509 --> 08:58.709
You're kidding.
That's fantastic.

08:58.745 --> 09:00.055
And it's not just
your main business.

09:00.079 --> 09:02.847
They want
your new venture too.

09:02.882 --> 09:06.917
I'd love to say yes, but
the new business isn't ready.

09:06.953 --> 09:09.420
Nick, it's not often
you get a top rate

09:09.455 --> 09:12.289
investment bank knocking on the
doors of a fledgling business.

09:12.325 --> 09:13.724
But if we do that,

09:13.760 --> 09:15.493
we won't get
the full price of our upside.

09:15.528 --> 09:17.461
What if I told you
they were willing to send over

09:17.497 --> 09:21.098
500,000 in cash
as a good faith advance

09:21.134 --> 09:22.700
against any transaction costs?

09:22.735 --> 09:25.636
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- I'm Samantha Wheeler.

09:25.671 --> 09:28.072
I work with Harvey.

09:28.107 --> 09:32.376
Like I said,
half a million dollars.

09:32.411 --> 09:34.178
All you have to do
is send your books over

09:34.213 --> 09:35.357
to start the business,
and we'll get down

09:35.381 --> 09:37.515
to making you
and your partner rich.

09:37.550 --> 09:41.631
Well, that's very generous,
but as I was just saying

09:41.632 --> 09:43.531
to Harvey, we're already rich,

09:43.567 --> 09:45.834
and I don't feel comfortable
giving away our upside--

09:45.869 --> 09:48.570
Nick, don't let this
briefcase get in the way

09:48.605 --> 09:50.205
of a great opportunity--
- Look.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.673
I appreciate you both
coming over,

09:51.708 --> 09:54.175
but we're in the middle
of our build out,

09:54.211 --> 09:56.578
so please, for right now,

09:56.613 --> 09:58.446
I prefer to keep things
like they are.

10:10.589 --> 10:13.490
- What the hell was that?
- That was one cool cucumber

10:13.525 --> 10:15.437
who sounds pretty good,
but couldn't hide the fact

10:15.461 --> 10:17.305
that he'd rather cut off his
arm than show us his books.

10:17.329 --> 10:19.605
I meant, what were you doing
coming into my meeting?

10:19.606 --> 10:20.939
I was introducing myself,

10:20.974 --> 10:22.707
so we could get off
on a better foot.

10:22.743 --> 10:24.454
I thought you said
we got off on the right foot.

10:24.478 --> 10:25.522
Well, I think so,
but I could tell you didn't.

10:25.546 --> 10:27.079
Well, let me
tell you something.

10:27.114 --> 10:28.558
Derailing my meeting
when it was going

10:28.582 --> 10:29.592
exactly as planned
isn't the way

10:29.616 --> 10:31.485
to get off on a better foot.

10:31.486 --> 10:33.186
I don't know what meeting
you were in,

10:33.221 --> 10:34.899
but that man was not
going to show you his books.

10:34.923 --> 10:36.856
And offering him a bribe
is going to get him to?

10:36.892 --> 10:39.626
It wasn't a bribe.
It's untraceable cash,

10:39.661 --> 10:41.701
which if he were embezzling,
he would have gone for.

10:41.730 --> 10:43.196
We're missing 50 million.

10:43.231 --> 10:45.932
500,000 isn't going to
get him out of his jam.

10:45.968 --> 10:47.634
Well, maybe
if your ex-assistant

10:47.669 --> 10:48.846
hadn't hamstrung me
with my expense account,

10:48.870 --> 10:50.203
it would have been more.

10:50.238 --> 10:51.738
Samantha,
you bring Donna into this,

10:51.773 --> 10:53.051
we're never getting
on the right foot.

10:53.075 --> 10:54.040
Look, that wasn't
what I meant. I--

10:54.076 --> 10:55.542
That's enough!

10:55.577 --> 10:56.688
I'm going to get
to the bottom of this,

10:56.712 --> 10:58.678
and I don't need your help,
so why don't you have

10:58.714 --> 11:00.447
some respect
for the chain of command,

11:00.482 --> 11:01.748
and stay away from my clients.

11:04.720 --> 11:06.286
Damn it.

11:08.657 --> 11:10.290
God damn it, what the--

11:16.465 --> 11:18.131
You know I knew that,
don't you?

11:18.166 --> 11:19.644
Of course you did,
you were just testing

11:19.668 --> 11:21.145
the structural integrity
of the machine

11:21.169 --> 11:23.370
and the water
and the coffee mug.

11:23.405 --> 11:25.071
- Precisely.
- Listen, Robert.

11:25.107 --> 11:26.906
I didn't come in here
by accident.

11:27.114 --> 11:28.825
I know we were on opposite
sides of the Samantha thing,

11:28.849 --> 11:31.750
but I also know you play golf,
and I thought it might be nice

11:31.785 --> 11:33.542
to get out there
and get to know each other.

11:33.543 --> 11:34.742
I think what you really mean

11:34.778 --> 11:37.111
is you'd like to impress
the new managing partner.

11:37.147 --> 11:38.313
And what if I did?

11:38.348 --> 11:40.248
Now let me
tell you something.

11:40.283 --> 11:43.550
We get on that course, one of
two things is going to happen.

11:43.551 --> 11:44.917
Either you're going
to piss me off

11:44.953 --> 11:46.853
by being a scratch golfer,
or you're going to

11:46.888 --> 11:48.421
piss me off
by being worse than me.

11:48.456 --> 11:50.189
What's your point?

11:50.225 --> 11:52.592
You want to impress me,
don't do it on a golf course.

11:52.627 --> 11:55.228
Do it with a big, fat client.

12:04.854 --> 12:07.421
- Harvey, we need to talk.
- We sure do.

12:07.457 --> 12:08.750
Did you just give
Samantha Wheeler

12:08.751 --> 12:10.885
the keys to Fort Knox
to use in my case?

12:10.920 --> 12:13.020
No, I refused to give her
an expense account

12:13.056 --> 12:15.856
even bigger than Fort Knox.
Why, what did she do?

12:15.892 --> 12:17.391
She tried
to hijack my meeting

12:17.427 --> 12:18.726
with a briefcase full of cash.

12:18.761 --> 12:20.461
Let me guess,
you didn't like it,

12:20.496 --> 12:22.141
and that's when she said
that she got the money from me.

12:22.165 --> 12:24.376
No, she said it would have
worked if you'd given her more.

12:24.400 --> 12:25.566
Which explains
why she went

12:25.601 --> 12:27.868
over both of our heads
to Robert.

12:27.904 --> 12:30.377
I don't believe this.
He tripled her expense account.

12:30.378 --> 12:32.832
Yes, he did.
Harvey, we need to figure out

12:32.833 --> 12:34.210
what we're going to do
about this woman.

12:34.234 --> 12:35.278
Well, I'll tell you
what I'm going to do.

12:35.302 --> 12:36.968
I'm going to go tell Robert

12:37.003 --> 12:39.137
that if he doesn't
shorten her leash, she's gone.

12:39.172 --> 12:41.539
Or you could
extend the olive branch,

12:41.575 --> 12:43.041
and let her
work the case with you.

12:43.076 --> 12:44.554
- And why would I do that?
- Because sometimes,

12:44.578 --> 12:46.478
it's best to
keep your friends close,

12:46.513 --> 12:49.414
and the new senior partner we
know nothing about even closer.

12:49.449 --> 12:50.526
Well, that's
all well and fine,

12:50.550 --> 12:52.717
but I am tired of
knowing nothing about her.

12:52.753 --> 12:54.219
So am I, so while you're

12:54.254 --> 12:55.653
keeping her distracted
with work,

12:55.689 --> 12:57.589
I'm going to go digging
in her medicine cabinet.

13:05.331 --> 13:07.132
Sheila, I need
to talk to you.

13:07.427 --> 13:09.120
Louis, you're an hour early.

13:09.121 --> 13:10.854
I hadn't got
my steno pad out yet.

13:10.889 --> 13:12.322
- I know, but--
- Oh, my God.

13:12.357 --> 13:13.924
You talked to Harvey,
didn't you?

13:13.959 --> 13:17.127
I did, and it turns out
that Harvey's stepping down--

13:17.162 --> 13:18.695
And now
you're managing partner.

13:18.730 --> 13:21.598
I knew it! You're even
more of a man than I thought.

13:21.633 --> 13:23.500
- Sheila--
- Ah, ah, Mr. Litt.

13:23.535 --> 13:26.403
It's not Sheila anymore.
It's Miss Sazs,

13:26.438 --> 13:28.371
secretary to the
managing partner,

13:28.407 --> 13:31.541
and I am ready to be managed.

13:32.069 --> 13:34.703
Sheila, as much as I would
love to manage you right now,

13:34.738 --> 13:36.538
now is not
the appropriate time.

13:36.573 --> 13:39.808
You're right.
It's not appropriate at all.

13:39.843 --> 13:43.578
Just like this isn't,
and this isn't,

13:43.613 --> 13:45.513
and this isn't--
- Whoa, Nelly.

13:45.549 --> 13:49.150
Manage me, Louis.
Manage the shit out of me.

13:49.186 --> 13:50.563
Okay, you want me
to manage the shit out of you?

13:50.587 --> 13:52.065
I'm going to manage
the shit out of you.

13:52.089 --> 13:53.166
And I'm not just Louis Litt.

13:53.190 --> 13:54.656
I'm--
- A joke.

13:54.691 --> 13:56.624
Look at him, pretending
to be managing partner.

13:56.660 --> 13:58.893
I can't believe he thinks
that we would go for it.

13:58.929 --> 13:59.761
Doesn't he know that
the first three letters

13:59.796 --> 14:00.862
of managing is "man"?

14:00.897 --> 14:04.199
Well, at least he's got
the "aging" part down.

14:04.234 --> 14:07.002
Speaking of down,
looks like managing partner's

14:07.037 --> 14:08.970
not the only job
he'd underperform.

14:09.006 --> 14:10.939
Louis?

14:10.974 --> 14:14.609
- Is something wrong?
- No, nothing.

14:14.644 --> 14:18.302
Louis, something's wrong.
You're not at attention.

14:18.303 --> 14:21.716
- I know, I just--I, uh...
- Oh, no, of course.

14:22.127 --> 14:23.493
I should have known.

14:23.528 --> 14:25.395
It's the stress
of your new job.

14:25.430 --> 14:27.096
You just became
managing partner,

14:27.132 --> 14:29.499
and you're gone
in the middle of the workday.

14:29.534 --> 14:31.667
Yes.

14:31.888 --> 14:34.355
Exactly, that's it.
- Then say no more.

14:34.390 --> 14:36.157
Return to your kingdom.

14:36.192 --> 14:38.092
There will be plenty of time
for this later.

14:48.829 --> 14:51.663
Oh, good.
You're still here.

14:51.699 --> 14:52.965
Wasn't about to be.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.502
What do you say
we both pretend I'm not?

14:56.537 --> 14:58.370
All right, what's going on?

14:58.406 --> 14:59.931
Have you had a run in
with Samantha Wheeler yet?

14:59.932 --> 15:02.633
No, but I take that to mean
one's coming.

15:02.668 --> 15:04.535
The way she operates,
you can bet on it.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.704
- How exactly does she operate?
- However the hell she wants.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.474
- Mm-hmm.
- My feelings exactly.

15:10.509 --> 15:12.276
Which is why I decided
to look into

15:12.311 --> 15:14.578
little Miss "I don't answer
to anyone" myself.

15:14.613 --> 15:16.380
Don't tell me
you came up empty.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.771
Worse, half the people I
asked say she's from Kansas.

15:18.772 --> 15:20.538
The other half, Manhattan.

15:20.574 --> 15:22.485
Somehow, she managed to
graduate from an Ivy League,

15:22.509 --> 15:23.686
a state school,
and the Sorbonne

15:23.710 --> 15:24.910
all within the same two years.

15:24.945 --> 15:27.913
One guy even says she's MI6,
but that's "just a hunch."

15:27.948 --> 15:31.683
So you're telling me
that no one has the same story

15:31.718 --> 15:33.451
and we don't know what's what?

15:33.487 --> 15:36.288
And since the only person
with more contacts

15:36.323 --> 15:38.556
than me is you, I was hoping

15:38.592 --> 15:40.358
you could help me
get some answers.

15:40.394 --> 15:42.894
Then turn around and
get a good night's sleep,

15:42.930 --> 15:44.529
because by tomorrow afternoon,

15:44.564 --> 15:45.942
you'll have all the answers
you need

15:45.966 --> 15:48.934
on little Miss James Bond.

15:48.969 --> 15:51.436
Do you think we should have a
secret handshake or something?

15:51.471 --> 15:53.939
- Just go.
- Okay.

15:57.461 --> 15:58.694
Louis, what are
you doing here?

15:58.729 --> 16:00.496
We don't have
a session scheduled.

16:00.531 --> 16:02.731
I'm not here for a session.
I'm here for an erection.

16:02.767 --> 16:04.933
- A--A what now?
- I need a prescription, Stan.

16:04.969 --> 16:06.635
I don't care if it's
for the blue pill,

16:06.670 --> 16:08.548
or for the one with
the couples in the bathtubs.

16:08.572 --> 16:10.239
I need it now.

16:10.274 --> 16:13.509
Okay, Louis, why don't you
tell me what's going on?

16:19.150 --> 16:20.649
Now that we have merged,

16:20.684 --> 16:23.152
Sheila thinks that I should
become managing partner.

16:23.187 --> 16:25.187
I told her that I would
bring it up to Harvey.

16:25.222 --> 16:27.656
But before I could do that,
he told me that

16:27.691 --> 16:29.869
he had already
handed the firm over to Zane.

16:29.870 --> 16:31.603
And as a result
of telling Sheila that,

16:31.638 --> 16:33.138
you are now having
intimacy issues.

16:33.173 --> 16:34.572
As a result
of letting Sheila think

16:34.608 --> 16:37.242
that I'm managing partner,
I can't get it up.

16:37.277 --> 16:39.478
Then I must tell you,
a prescription

16:39.479 --> 16:41.412
is not going to
solve your problem, Louis.

16:41.413 --> 16:42.315
Why not?

16:42.316 --> 16:44.315
Because your issue
isn't blood flow.

16:44.350 --> 16:45.816
It's that you are lying
to Sheila.

16:45.851 --> 16:48.352
- Doc.
- Louis.

16:48.387 --> 16:50.754
How long are you planning
to hide the fact

16:50.790 --> 16:52.556
that you're not really
managing partner?

16:52.591 --> 16:53.669
I don't know,
two to three years?

16:53.693 --> 16:55.225
My father convinced my mother

16:55.261 --> 16:56.638
that he was a vice president
for a decade.

16:56.662 --> 16:58.395
It can be done.

16:58.772 --> 17:00.664
Be that as it may,

17:00.981 --> 17:03.048
as I recall,
you accepted Harvey becoming

17:03.083 --> 17:04.683
managing partner
after Jessica left.

17:04.718 --> 17:05.762
That's when I realized
that I didn't want to

17:05.786 --> 17:07.486
become managing partner.

17:07.521 --> 17:10.489
Then why are you so reluctant
to tell Sheila that?

17:12.893 --> 17:17.095
Because she's always
been attracted to my power.

17:17.131 --> 17:18.375
I tell her that
I don't want to be something

17:18.398 --> 17:19.731
that she wants me to be--

17:19.767 --> 17:21.532
You're afraid she will
no longer want you.

17:22.094 --> 17:25.095
- I can't lose her again, doc.
- I know, my friend.

17:25.130 --> 17:27.964
But true power
is not pretending

17:27.999 --> 17:29.766
to be what you're not.

17:29.801 --> 17:31.801
It's admitting the truth
of who you are.

17:36.797 --> 17:38.397
Katrina, you have a minute?

17:38.432 --> 17:39.943
Of course, what can I
do for you, Alex?

17:39.967 --> 17:41.812
I was actually hoping
you might be able to help me

17:41.836 --> 17:43.469
narrow down a list.

17:43.504 --> 17:44.815
Seems like that's
my specialty these days.

17:44.839 --> 17:46.906
What kind of list?

17:46.941 --> 17:48.585
These are the clients
who stayed with Rand Kaldor

17:48.609 --> 17:49.820
after the merger.
- That's right.

17:49.844 --> 17:51.443
And I want to know
which one of them

17:51.479 --> 17:53.279
Robert Zane would like
to have back the most.

17:53.314 --> 17:54.825
Well, if you want to know
who he'd like to have back

17:54.849 --> 17:57.082
the most,
it's Starboard Airlines.

17:57.118 --> 18:00.386
But if you want to know who you
should go after, I'm not sure.

18:00.421 --> 18:02.232
Why wouldn't I want to
go after Starboard Airlines?

18:02.256 --> 18:03.534
Because they
used to be represented

18:03.558 --> 18:05.891
by Samantha Wheeler.
- I see.

18:06.208 --> 18:08.341
Look, Alex, I don't know
how much you know about her,

18:08.376 --> 18:09.687
but I wouldn't
want to pick a fight

18:09.711 --> 18:11.111
with Samantha Wheeler
if it were me.

18:11.380 --> 18:12.557
Well, I appreciate
the warning,

18:12.581 --> 18:15.715
but if Starboard's the client
Robert would like,

18:15.751 --> 18:17.417
that's the client
I'm going after.

18:17.453 --> 18:18.885
Whether Samantha
likes it or not.

18:18.921 --> 18:21.288
Then I wish you luck,
but do me a favor.

18:21.323 --> 18:22.622
When she finds out about this,

18:22.658 --> 18:24.257
don't tell her
you got it from me.

18:30.468 --> 18:33.302
Thanks, Joe.
Now, you only owe me one.

18:35.373 --> 18:37.306
Harvey.
- Look.

18:37.342 --> 18:40.176
I'm not that big on apologies,
so you're not going to get one.

18:40.211 --> 18:42.845
But I thought about it,
and if you're still interested

18:42.880 --> 18:44.858
in working this thing together,
I'm good with that.

18:44.882 --> 18:46.148
Good,
because I found out

18:46.184 --> 18:47.850
some things
you might want to know.

18:47.885 --> 18:48.751
You kept working on it,
even after

18:48.786 --> 18:50.720
I told you to stay out of it?

18:50.755 --> 18:52.121
I'm not big
on apologies, either.

18:52.156 --> 18:54.023
This is the best
you're going to get.

18:54.058 --> 18:55.903
As far as I can tell
from Nick's bank statements,

18:55.927 --> 18:58.561
he doesn't spend shit
on shit; he's clean.

18:58.596 --> 19:00.696
Well, his spending
may be accounted for,

19:00.732 --> 19:03.265
but the original
50 million isn't.

19:03.301 --> 19:05.801
- What are you talking about?
- I can't find any record

19:05.837 --> 19:08.356
of deposits
before the second 50 came in.

19:08.357 --> 19:09.990
As far as I can tell,

19:10.025 --> 19:12.926
that 50 covered
the entire cost of the project.

19:12.962 --> 19:16.697
Wait a second.
He didn't need the first 50.

19:16.732 --> 19:17.965
He needed the second 50.

19:18.000 --> 19:18.899
And he couldn't
get the second

19:18.934 --> 19:20.701
without saying
he had the first.

19:20.736 --> 19:22.235
Which means
he misrepresented himself

19:22.271 --> 19:24.738
to his investors, and
this is definitely criminal.

19:24.773 --> 19:28.108
Shit, we need to go tell Max,
and run through his options.

19:28.143 --> 19:31.156
Harvey, I've fixed
a lot of situations like this.

19:31.157 --> 19:32.423
The first thing we need to do

19:32.458 --> 19:34.158
is go to the guy
that caused the problem.

19:34.193 --> 19:36.193
And give him a chance
to implicate his partner?

19:36.228 --> 19:38.662
No way, we go to the guy
who came to us.

19:38.698 --> 19:40.864
He's our client.
- The business is our client.

19:40.900 --> 19:42.933
And I'm okay with you
working with me on this,

19:42.969 --> 19:46.503
but I am not okay with you
working it against me.

19:46.539 --> 19:49.573
Okay, we'll go to Max
first thing in the morning.

19:49.608 --> 19:51.542
I have your word
you'll leave it until tomorrow?

19:51.577 --> 19:53.310
You have my word.

19:53.346 --> 19:55.779
Then let's figure out
how to get them out of this.

19:58.449 --> 20:00.578
So you're telling me
Nick defrauded our investors?

20:00.661 --> 20:03.256
No, Max, I'm telling you
that's what it looks like.

20:03.257 --> 20:04.448
I don't give a shit
what it looks like.

20:04.449 --> 20:06.707
We need to know what it is.
- No, we don't.

20:06.708 --> 20:08.507
Because right now,
it's conjecture.

20:08.543 --> 20:10.609
We prove it,
we have an obligation

20:10.645 --> 20:13.037
to inform your investors.
- So inform them.

20:13.038 --> 20:14.950
We do that, your whole
company goes out of business.

20:14.974 --> 20:17.408
And if I keep this a secret,
they'll think I was in on it.

20:17.443 --> 20:19.176
This discussion is over,
I need--

20:19.211 --> 20:21.111
What you need
is to calm down,

20:21.147 --> 20:25.115
and listen to us right now,
because we have a way out.

20:25.151 --> 20:27.251
- What is it?
- According to your contract,

20:27.286 --> 20:29.153
you have the option
to buy out your investors

20:29.188 --> 20:31.054
at a 30% return.

20:31.210 --> 20:35.130
They go away happy, and we put
this in our rearview mirror.

20:35.131 --> 20:37.765
And assuming we can even come
up with that kind of money,

20:37.801 --> 20:39.745
what if someone finds out
before we do?

20:39.746 --> 20:41.624
- No one's going to find--
- That's not an answer.

20:41.648 --> 20:43.515
- Max--
- No.

20:43.550 --> 20:45.617
This is Nick's mistake,
not mine,

20:45.652 --> 20:47.219
and innocent people
go to the police.

20:47.254 --> 20:49.221
Listen to me,
you turn him in,

20:49.256 --> 20:51.223
you'll look like
a guilty man running scared.

20:51.258 --> 20:53.358
- I am scared.
- Max.

20:53.393 --> 20:57.996
You used to trust Mike.
Now I need you to trust me.

20:58.180 --> 21:01.181
We get these guys paid off;
it'll take maybe three days.

21:01.217 --> 21:03.150
Then you're fine.

21:06.295 --> 21:10.364
Okay, Harvey.
I trust you.

21:14.170 --> 21:16.270
Okay, we did it your way.

21:16.305 --> 21:19.573
We talked to Max, and we
presented a united front.

21:19.609 --> 21:22.176
You better not be saying
you want to divide it now.

21:22.211 --> 21:24.912
All I'm saying
is there's another option.

21:24.947 --> 21:27.679
We replace the fabricated
50 million with a real 50

21:27.680 --> 21:30.211
from an actual investor;
no one will ever know.

21:30.212 --> 21:31.632
Oh, so all we have to do

21:31.633 --> 21:33.647
is commit fraud
to get out of fraud?

21:33.682 --> 21:34.716
And how, exactly,
is that any different

21:34.717 --> 21:35.239
from what you want to do?

21:35.240 --> 21:37.172
Because my way
is protected

21:37.208 --> 21:38.774
under the letter of the law.

21:38.809 --> 21:40.275
And we have to pay
a 30% return

21:40.311 --> 21:42.010
on something
that isn't worth it.

21:42.046 --> 21:44.546
Keeping Max out of prison
seems worth it to me.

21:44.582 --> 21:45.981
So instead of fighting with me,

21:46.016 --> 21:47.327
why don't you
start thinking about

21:47.351 --> 21:48.628
where we're going
to get that money?

21:56.534 --> 21:58.667
Gavin Andrews.

21:58.703 --> 22:01.203
You must be the guy
who wants to be my new lawyer.

22:01.238 --> 22:02.638
I see you like
to cut to the chase.

22:02.849 --> 22:03.993
You ever hear the saying
"time is money"?

22:04.017 --> 22:05.350
Well, I got a shitload of one,

22:05.385 --> 22:06.651
because I don't
waste the other.

22:06.686 --> 22:08.286
Then why in God's name
are you wasting

22:08.321 --> 22:10.355
either one of them
at a firm like Rand Kaldor?

22:10.390 --> 22:12.168
You really want to kick them
when they're down, don't you?

22:12.192 --> 22:14.359
This isn't about them.
This is about you.

22:14.394 --> 22:17.262
You've got routes under siege.
You've lost gates at LaGuardia.

22:17.297 --> 22:19.075
And if you think Kaldor's idea
of you merging with Delta

22:19.099 --> 22:20.532
is the answer to your problems,

22:20.567 --> 22:22.667
then you're not the man
I thought you were.

22:22.702 --> 22:24.202
Okay.

22:24.408 --> 22:25.852
You get one case;
you handle it right,

22:25.876 --> 22:27.576
you can have my business.

22:27.611 --> 22:29.456
I'm not in the habit of
sharing custody of a client.

22:29.480 --> 22:31.280
You're not sharing,
because you're not

22:31.315 --> 22:34.283
officially my lawyer, and it's
not business; it's personal.

22:34.649 --> 22:36.661
You're telling me I handle
a personal issue for you,

22:36.685 --> 22:39.419
off the record,
I get your corporate business?

22:39.454 --> 22:41.487
Why would you do that?
- Because I need someone

22:41.523 --> 22:43.356
I can trust to handle both.

22:43.391 --> 22:45.169
Now before you say anything,
if you agree to this,

22:45.193 --> 22:47.627
you're my guy, not some
associate, not another partner.

22:47.662 --> 22:49.696
You.

22:49.731 --> 22:52.665
Okay, I'm in.

22:52.701 --> 22:55.201
And the only thing left for you
to do is tell me what you need.

22:55.433 --> 22:57.567
The truth is, I'm in the
middle of a nasty divorce,

22:57.602 --> 23:00.303
which had led to an even
nastier custody battle.

23:00.338 --> 23:02.105
How many kids,
and what are their ages?

23:02.140 --> 23:03.640
Just one.

23:03.675 --> 23:05.508
And she's 185 years old.

23:13.721 --> 23:15.165
Harvey, I know
you're on your way out,

23:15.189 --> 23:18.423
but you got to see this.
- What is it?

23:18.459 --> 23:20.425
I don't believe this.
- What are you going to do?

23:20.461 --> 23:22.194
What I should have done
in the first place.

23:22.229 --> 23:26.932
Kick Samantha Wheeler
the hell off this case.

23:27.596 --> 23:29.730
What the hell did you do?

23:29.765 --> 23:32.999
- I take it Max called you?
- No, he sent Donna a letter

23:33.035 --> 23:36.203
formalizing Nick Turner's
transition to CEO

23:36.238 --> 23:37.816
since Max is suddenly
leaving the company.

23:37.840 --> 23:39.840
Actually, he's stepping down

23:39.875 --> 23:41.375
to spend more time
with his family.

23:41.410 --> 23:43.310
I don't give a shit
what he's doing.

23:43.345 --> 23:45.712
I want to know what you did.
- I did what you wouldn't do.

23:45.748 --> 23:47.681
Protect the client.
- Bullshit.

23:47.716 --> 23:50.384
Max agreed to exercise
the buyout clause.

23:50.419 --> 23:54.020
And yet, he still contacted
a criminal defense attorney.

23:54.056 --> 23:55.889
- What?
- He panicked,

23:55.924 --> 23:57.102
and he wasn't
going to keep his mouth shut,

23:57.126 --> 23:59.426
and our client was
going to go out of business.

23:59.461 --> 24:02.028
So you felt the answer
was forcing him out?

24:02.064 --> 24:05.198
The answer was and always is
protect the company.

24:05.654 --> 24:08.254
And the fact that you were
more focused on protecting Max

24:08.290 --> 24:10.089
than our client
is exactly why Robert

24:10.125 --> 24:11.569
wanted me to get involved
in the first place.

24:11.593 --> 24:13.226
What?

24:13.261 --> 24:15.562
I wasn't trying to
make things better with you.

24:15.597 --> 24:19.465
He wanted me
to keep an eye on you.

24:20.272 --> 24:22.005
You had no right

24:22.040 --> 24:23.640
to force that kid
out of his own company.

24:23.675 --> 24:26.576
- I didn't force him out.
- Save your bullshit.

24:26.612 --> 24:27.789
You gave me your word
that you weren't going to be

24:27.813 --> 24:29.179
pulling something like this,

24:29.214 --> 24:31.014
so stay the hell away
from my client,

24:31.049 --> 24:33.817
or the next time you
make a move behind my back,

24:33.852 --> 24:36.586
you'll be finding yourself
another job.

24:41.401 --> 24:46.071
Oh, there he is.
How was your day, my king?

24:46.106 --> 24:48.006
Not great, actually.

24:48.041 --> 24:50.842
Well, maybe I can
release your stress.

24:50.878 --> 24:53.879
Sheila, wait.
We need to talk.

24:53.914 --> 24:55.547
Oh, shoot,
you've had a hard day.

24:55.582 --> 24:57.716
We can talk later.
Right now is--

24:57.751 --> 24:59.751
I'm not managing partner.

25:02.656 --> 25:04.089
What?

25:04.124 --> 25:05.624
I went to Harvey,
like I said.

25:05.659 --> 25:07.425
Before I could
get the words out,

25:07.461 --> 25:09.339
he said that he had already
offered the job to Robert.

25:09.363 --> 25:12.297
Well, what happened when you
told him you wanted the job?

25:12.332 --> 25:15.033
I didn't say
I wanted the job.

25:15.068 --> 25:19.171
Wait, so instead of fighting
for what you want,

25:19.206 --> 25:21.952
you decided to lie to me
about getting it?

25:21.953 --> 25:24.587
- Oh, Sheila, that's not fair.
- How could you lie to me?

25:24.622 --> 25:26.889
I didn't. I came here
to tell you the truth.

25:26.924 --> 25:28.402
But you thought
I already had the job,

25:28.426 --> 25:29.603
and you seemed
so excited about it.

25:29.627 --> 25:31.427
Oh, my God.

25:31.462 --> 25:33.629
That's why you couldn't
have sex, isn't it?

25:33.664 --> 25:36.165
Yes.

25:36.815 --> 25:39.049
Yes, so I went to
Dr. Lipschitz to talk about it,

25:39.084 --> 25:40.717
and you know what he told me?

25:40.753 --> 25:43.720
He told me that I should trust
that you love me

25:43.756 --> 25:45.522
and that I can
tell you the truth.

25:45.557 --> 25:47.724
And I think instead
of letting your therapist

25:47.760 --> 25:49.493
convince you to
give up your dream,

25:49.528 --> 25:51.928
maybe you should have marched
back into Harvey's office

25:51.964 --> 25:53.341
to take what's yours.
- Sheila, please.

25:53.365 --> 25:54.631
I'm not giving up anything.

25:54.666 --> 25:56.733
I don't want to be
managing partner.

25:56.769 --> 25:59.469
And now you're not
only lying to me,

25:59.505 --> 26:03.440
you're lying to yourself.
- No, I'm not.

26:03.475 --> 26:07.544
I don't want managing partner,
and you said you love me.

26:08.153 --> 26:10.053
Well, this is who I am,

26:10.089 --> 26:13.123
and you can either accept that
or not, but it's not changing.

26:22.128 --> 26:24.524
And it's understandable
for you

26:24.525 --> 26:26.334
to be concerned about your
brother.

26:26.703 --> 26:28.436
But...

26:28.472 --> 26:32.207
why do you believe
he's lying to himself?

26:32.794 --> 26:34.861
Because I know my brother,

26:34.896 --> 26:37.096
and I know he wanted
that promotion.

26:37.132 --> 26:39.666
And I can't stand seeing him
not go after it,

26:39.701 --> 26:43.136
just because some crackpot
undermined his confidence.

26:43.171 --> 26:46.139
And who exactly is this--
this crackpot?

26:46.174 --> 26:50.910
I'll tell you who it is.
It's his...mother.

26:51.134 --> 26:53.534
Uh, forgive me,
but wouldn't you refer

26:53.569 --> 26:54.835
to his mother as your mother?

26:54.871 --> 26:58.506
Well, yes, but...

26:58.541 --> 26:59.818
Well, this isn't about me,
I'm trying to--

26:59.842 --> 27:02.376
Oh, my God, you're Sheila.

27:02.412 --> 27:03.889
I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

27:03.913 --> 27:05.780
I'm sorry, but I told you
on the phone.

27:05.815 --> 27:07.793
It is unethical for me to see
you without Louis' permission.

27:07.817 --> 27:09.750
I could care less
about your ethics.

27:09.786 --> 27:12.620
- Excuse me?
- Cut the bullshit, Lipschitz.

27:12.655 --> 27:15.423
Louis came to see you after
Zane got managing partner,

27:15.458 --> 27:18.220
and instead of encouraging him
to take it back,

27:18.221 --> 27:20.855
you undermined his confidence.
- Hm.

27:24.194 --> 27:26.694
It's interesting
that you think I'm the one

27:26.730 --> 27:29.397
undermining his confidence,
because the only times

27:29.432 --> 27:31.666
in his life that Louis
has been unable to perform

27:31.701 --> 27:34.702
have been with you,
including most recently

27:34.738 --> 27:36.503
when he went to tell you
the truth and couldn't

27:36.504 --> 27:39.005
because he was afraid
of how you might view him.

27:39.040 --> 27:40.560
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

27:41.029 --> 27:44.130
It means, as well
as you think you know him,

27:44.166 --> 27:45.765
he may know you even better.

27:45.801 --> 27:48.835
Because Louis does not
want to be managing partner.

27:48.871 --> 27:50.170
And rather than believe him,

27:50.205 --> 27:54.007
you can only see
his admission as cowardice.

27:56.445 --> 27:59.880
But I don't understand.

27:59.915 --> 28:01.414
He wanted
managing partner once.

28:01.450 --> 28:02.527
Why would he
change his mind now?

28:02.551 --> 28:06.920
Because people
are not set in stone.

28:06.955 --> 28:11.424
And I suspect
something has replaced

28:11.460 --> 28:13.994
managing partner
as his heart's desire.

28:14.029 --> 28:16.062
- A baby.
- No, Sheila.

28:16.098 --> 28:17.831
Love.

28:17.866 --> 28:20.534
And I don't think
you need me to tell you

28:20.569 --> 28:24.471
Louis Litt would do anything
to not lose the woman he loves.

28:29.631 --> 28:32.265
You know, I had heard about
the legendary Donna Paulson

28:32.300 --> 28:34.901
long before I even got here.
- Oh, that's interesting.

28:34.936 --> 28:36.769
Because I've never
heard of you.

28:36.805 --> 28:38.749
Because that's how I want it,
but you want to be known.

28:38.773 --> 28:40.606
And I got to tell you,

28:40.642 --> 28:44.310
the reality is a lot more
disappointing than the legend.

28:44.346 --> 28:46.512
- Excuse me?
- I had a run-in with Harvey

28:46.548 --> 28:48.448
because you went running
to him about Max.

28:48.483 --> 28:49.860
You're damn right I did,
he deserves to know

28:49.884 --> 28:51.651
when someone's
operating behind his back.

28:51.686 --> 28:52.652
And I deserve the chance
to tell him

28:52.687 --> 28:54.687
what's going on to his face.

28:54.723 --> 28:56.067
Oh, so you're upset because
I beat you to the punch?

28:56.091 --> 28:58.725
I'm upset because
if you have any issue with me,

28:58.760 --> 29:00.893
you should come to me
and not go around me.

29:00.929 --> 29:01.627
Like how you
went around me to Robert

29:01.663 --> 29:03.396
for your expense account?

29:03.431 --> 29:05.204
So that's what
this is really about.

29:05.205 --> 29:07.772
No, this is about
your behavior with Harvey

29:07.808 --> 29:10.141
and Alex and me
and about 100 other things

29:10.177 --> 29:11.220
that all tell me
you don't care about

29:11.244 --> 29:13.011
anyone here but yourself.

29:13.046 --> 29:14.757
If you really think that,
you know nothing about me,

29:14.781 --> 29:16.681
and I'll tell you
something else.

29:16.717 --> 29:20.652
Secretly digging into me isn't
gonna answer your questions.

29:20.687 --> 29:23.028
Yeah, I know you've been
doing that too.

29:23.029 --> 29:24.361
And I wouldn't have to

29:24.397 --> 29:25.908
if you'd been upfront
about who you are.

29:25.932 --> 29:27.309
You want to know
something about me?

29:27.333 --> 29:29.111
You go ahead and ask.
- And how should I trust

29:29.135 --> 29:30.568
that I'd get a straight answer?

29:30.603 --> 29:32.903
Because I am on
this team now,

29:32.939 --> 29:34.249
and whether
you believe it or not,

29:34.273 --> 29:36.774
I've got its
best interests at heart.

29:36.809 --> 29:38.842
Well, you got a funny way
of showing it.

29:38.878 --> 29:41.078
Because from where I stand,
Harvey is the firm,

29:41.113 --> 29:43.647
and you don't seem to
have his back at all.

29:56.005 --> 29:57.672
Are you enjoying the ballet?

29:57.707 --> 29:59.974
I most certainly am,
and how about yourself?

30:00.009 --> 30:01.542
To tell you the truth,
Mrs. Andrews,

30:01.578 --> 30:02.588
I wouldn't be less entertained

30:02.612 --> 30:04.545
if this were
a second grade musical.

30:04.581 --> 30:06.314
Who are you,
and what are you doing here?

30:06.349 --> 30:07.815
I'm here on behalf
of your husband.

30:07.851 --> 30:09.650
Then you can turn around,
and walk right out

30:09.686 --> 30:12.253
because you can't contact me
without my attorneys present.

30:12.288 --> 30:15.323
And that would be true, if I
was his lawyer, but I'm not.

30:15.654 --> 30:19.059
And what exactly did my
soon-to-be ex-husband tell you?

30:19.060 --> 30:20.693
That whatever issues you had

30:20.728 --> 30:22.928
led you to take
his prized Renoir and loan it

30:22.964 --> 30:25.765
to the Met for the sole purpose
of infuriating him.

30:25.800 --> 30:27.667
He's lucky I didn't
burn the damn thing.

30:27.702 --> 30:30.670
All the same, I'm here to
convince you to take it back.

30:30.705 --> 30:33.639
Now, what will it take
to get you to join the team?

30:35.984 --> 30:38.284
The Villa in Bordeaux,
free and clear.

30:38.319 --> 30:40.853
And I never want to worry
about covering the taxes.

30:40.889 --> 30:43.022
- That's a big ask.
- And it's an expensive

30:43.058 --> 30:44.824
painting that I have
no interest in,

30:44.859 --> 30:46.904
and he can't get back
without looking like an asshole

30:46.928 --> 30:50.029
to the kind of people
he wants to do business with.

30:50.469 --> 30:51.868
What?

30:51.903 --> 30:53.214
I can see
why you don't really care

30:53.238 --> 30:54.804
if your lawyers
are here or not.

30:54.840 --> 30:56.606
So we have a deal?

31:01.861 --> 31:03.961
We need to talk.

31:03.997 --> 31:05.596
Don't tell me
Harvey came to you.

31:05.632 --> 31:08.161
- He sure did.
- What exactly did he say?

31:09.530 --> 31:11.096
I'm not here to talk about
what he said.

31:11.131 --> 31:13.031
I'm here to talk about
what you're doing.

31:13.067 --> 31:15.100
I'm doing what you
asked me to do.

31:15.135 --> 31:17.869
I asked you to help the man,
not piss him off.

31:17.905 --> 31:19.338
You asked me
to save the client.

31:19.373 --> 31:20.639
This is what
it's going to take,

31:20.674 --> 31:22.908
and since when do you care
if I piss someone off?

31:22.943 --> 31:24.521
Since you made me promise
to put your name

31:24.545 --> 31:25.545
up on that wall next.

31:25.579 --> 31:26.878
Because if you do this,

31:26.914 --> 31:28.614
Harvey's going to do
anything he can

31:28.649 --> 31:30.947
to stop your name from ever
going up on that wall.

31:30.948 --> 31:32.747
You asked me
to do it, Robert.

31:32.783 --> 31:35.984
I can't take it back.
What do you want me to do now?

31:36.019 --> 31:38.853
Show Harvey
what I see in you.

31:38.889 --> 31:42.457
Whatever happens along the way,
when push comes to shove,

31:42.492 --> 31:44.826
you will never let him down.

31:56.386 --> 31:58.052
Am I interrupting?

31:58.087 --> 31:59.754
Sheila, what are you
doing here?

31:59.789 --> 32:02.657
Well, I realized, that, um...

32:02.692 --> 32:06.093
that you've been to
my office a lot recently,

32:06.129 --> 32:09.764
but I haven't come to yours
in a long time.

32:09.799 --> 32:13.100
Well, I know it's not
the office that you, uh...

32:13.136 --> 32:14.502
wanted for me.

32:14.537 --> 32:17.538
It's the
perfect office, Louis.

32:17.574 --> 32:21.943
And you are the perfect man.

32:22.467 --> 32:24.200
And I'm sorry
if I made you feel

32:24.235 --> 32:26.669
like I ever
thought differently.

32:26.704 --> 32:28.137
So you don't think I'm weak

32:28.173 --> 32:29.872
for not wanting
to be managing partner?

32:29.908 --> 32:32.542
No, I don't.

32:32.577 --> 32:33.910
And the reason I got so upset

32:33.945 --> 32:35.812
wasn't because
I think you're weak.

32:35.847 --> 32:38.681
It's that I thought
Harvey and Robert Zane

32:38.716 --> 32:42.452
didn't even value you enough
to hear you out.

32:42.931 --> 32:44.108
- No, they didn't.
- And on top of that,

32:44.132 --> 32:46.299
you were so excited to go
in there and make your case.

32:46.334 --> 32:49.903
- Yes, I was.
- So what happened?

32:49.938 --> 32:54.140
- I went in to see Harvey.
- And what?

32:54.175 --> 32:56.676
He didn't even give me
the goddamn time of day.

32:56.711 --> 32:58.678
Okay, Louis, I'm not trying
to get you worked up.

32:58.876 --> 33:00.154
Because I'm telling you,
I don't need you

33:00.178 --> 33:01.844
to be managing partner.

33:01.879 --> 33:02.990
No, and I don't need it
either, but what I do need

33:03.014 --> 33:04.947
is to be given
the common courtesy

33:04.982 --> 33:06.682
of being treated like an equal.

33:06.718 --> 33:09.752
So what are you going to do?

33:09.787 --> 33:11.065
Well, the first thing
I'm going to do

33:11.089 --> 33:11.821
is go home right now
and do what I

33:11.856 --> 33:13.989
couldn't do the other day.

33:14.025 --> 33:16.592
Then tomorrow, first thing, I'm
going to go tell Robert Zane

33:16.627 --> 33:19.462
and Harvey Specter that there
are three names on that wall,

33:19.497 --> 33:22.264
and one of them deserves
some goddamn respect.

33:24.202 --> 33:25.868
Okay.

33:25.903 --> 33:29.271
I got your mysterious message
about meeting in here.

33:30.093 --> 33:31.207
What's going on?

33:31.813 --> 33:33.780
Did you find something out
about Samantha?

33:33.815 --> 33:35.748
- She did.
- What are you doing here?

33:35.784 --> 33:37.232
She's here because like you,

33:37.233 --> 33:40.000
I got a lot of
conflicting information.

33:40.036 --> 33:41.079
She's the only person I know

33:41.103 --> 33:45.072
that's had direct experience
with Samantha.

33:45.107 --> 33:46.707
Well?

33:46.742 --> 33:49.143
People either love her
or are afraid of her.

33:49.178 --> 33:51.123
But anyone who's ever used her
says the same thing.

33:51.147 --> 33:53.113
She is as good as they come.

33:53.149 --> 33:55.849
And when the chips are down,
you want her in your corner.

33:55.885 --> 33:58.118
Do you think
she's in our corner?

33:58.154 --> 34:00.020
I guess that depends
on whether or not

34:00.056 --> 34:02.322
Robert and Harvey
are in the same corner.

34:16.735 --> 34:17.896
I know you're
not in the mood.

34:18.304 --> 34:20.385
I just want to explain what
happened with Max Louden.

34:20.511 --> 34:22.147
I know what happened.
You blackmailed him.

34:22.148 --> 34:25.583
- I did not blackmail him.
- Then what did you do?

34:25.619 --> 34:28.386
I asked myself, how the hell
did Nick pull this shit

34:28.420 --> 34:31.022
on Max in the first place?
He's not an idiot.

34:31.404 --> 34:32.637
He must have been distracted.

34:32.672 --> 34:34.172
What difference
does that make?

34:34.206 --> 34:36.139
The difference is,
Max was distracted

34:36.176 --> 34:38.376
with his sister
who has cancer.

34:38.411 --> 34:40.545
So I pulled some strings,
got her into a trial,

34:40.580 --> 34:42.914
and he was more than happy
to step down.

34:42.949 --> 34:46.083
Okay, so you didn't
boot him out the way I thought.

34:46.119 --> 34:47.452
What's going
to stop Nick Turner

34:47.487 --> 34:49.320
from putting us
in this position again?

34:49.356 --> 34:50.565
What would have
stopped him your way?

34:50.590 --> 34:52.223
Max would've.

34:52.257 --> 34:54.792
That was the reason
I wanted to back him.

34:54.828 --> 34:58.262
Well, this isn't Max,
but maybe it will do.

35:04.894 --> 35:06.827
Let me guess, you want to be
the one to do it.

35:06.862 --> 35:09.897
No, I don't.
He's your client; you do it.

35:09.932 --> 35:11.965
Unless, of course,
you need me to hold your hand.

35:13.702 --> 35:15.769
I'm pretty sure I can
take care of this myself.

35:18.741 --> 35:20.541
This is nice work, Samantha.

35:22.711 --> 35:24.711
I just want to be
part of the team.

35:28.117 --> 35:30.984
You know, the place is really
starting to come together.

35:31.020 --> 35:33.487
Doesn't look any different
than the last time you saw it.

35:33.522 --> 35:36.123
I know, I just figured
you're a bullshit artist,

35:36.158 --> 35:37.925
so you'd probably appreciate

35:37.960 --> 35:40.027
a little smoke
blown up your ass.

35:40.654 --> 35:42.854
- Excuse me?
- Okay, have it your way.

35:42.890 --> 35:44.768
We'll cut the bullshit
and get to the part where you

35:44.792 --> 35:47.325
defrauded your investors
to pay for this place.

35:47.361 --> 35:48.671
- I didn't--
- And before you even

35:48.695 --> 35:50.629
lie to me about it,

35:50.664 --> 35:53.365
why don't you start thanking me
for getting you out of it?

35:53.400 --> 35:55.500
- You got me new funding?
- I did.

35:55.536 --> 35:57.569
Of course, to do that,
I had to let the bank in

35:57.604 --> 36:00.605
on your IPO plans.
- I don't have any IPO plans.

36:00.641 --> 36:03.108
You do now.

36:03.143 --> 36:05.277
I get it.

36:05.312 --> 36:06.890
Once we're publicly traded,
I'll have a board of directors,

36:06.914 --> 36:09.214
and they'll have
full access to my books.

36:09.249 --> 36:11.327
Which means I hope you
enjoyed breaking the law once,

36:11.351 --> 36:13.919
because it's never
going to happen again.

36:13.954 --> 36:16.354
And what if I say no,
and then I fire you?

36:16.390 --> 36:18.190
Well, then you
end up in prison,

36:18.225 --> 36:22.017
which happens 99% of the time
in cases like this anyway.

36:22.018 --> 36:23.359
What happens the other
1% of the time?

36:23.360 --> 36:26.295
You're looking at him.
And trust me, Nick.

36:26.330 --> 36:29.398
A guy who can do what I did,
you want him on your team.

36:33.971 --> 36:36.004
I'll be in touch.

36:41.488 --> 36:44.823
Harvey, you look like the cat
that ate the canary.

36:44.858 --> 36:47.025
More like the man
who took care of business.

36:47.061 --> 36:49.494
- So you got it done?
- Samantha got it done.

36:49.530 --> 36:51.930
- Does that mean we're good?
- It means the next time

36:51.965 --> 36:53.576
you're worried
about how I handle my clients,

36:53.600 --> 36:55.734
tell me to my face.

36:55.769 --> 36:57.369
Fair enough.

36:57.404 --> 36:59.471
And how about Samantha?
You good with her?

36:59.506 --> 37:02.140
I wouldn't go throwing
a ticker tape parade just yet,

37:02.176 --> 37:06.211
but yeah, I admit, I'm starting
to see what you see in her.

37:06.246 --> 37:08.480
Well, that's all
I was hoping for.

37:08.515 --> 37:11.483
Which means now, I can tell you
why I was hoping it.

37:11.518 --> 37:16.083
What's going on?
What haven't you told me?

37:16.084 --> 37:18.418
That her name
goes up on the wall next.

37:18.453 --> 37:21.421
And before you say anything,
I gave her my word.

37:21.456 --> 37:22.922
- Listen, Robert--
- Whatever it is

37:22.958 --> 37:24.769
you're about to say,
it's going to have to wait,

37:24.793 --> 37:26.237
because the three of us are
going to have a little talk

37:26.261 --> 37:27.827
about something
right the hell now.

37:27.862 --> 37:29.707
- What's going on, Louis?
- I'll tell you what it is.

37:29.731 --> 37:32.409
The two of you decided
who's running this firm

37:32.410 --> 37:34.043
without including me
in the conversation.

37:34.079 --> 37:36.312
What are you talking about?
You signed the agreement.

37:36.348 --> 37:37.280
The agreement
that you drew up,

37:37.315 --> 37:39.315
and just expected me
to be okay with.

37:39.351 --> 37:40.862
You're saying that you
want to be managing partner?

37:40.886 --> 37:42.252
No, Robbie.

37:42.287 --> 37:45.221
But you wouldn't know that,
because you never asked,

37:45.257 --> 37:47.090
and I will not
be the third wheel

37:47.125 --> 37:49.025
just because
my name comes last.

37:49.026 --> 37:51.102
No one thinks of you
as a third wheel, Louis.

37:51.103 --> 37:52.769
Oh, really?

37:52.805 --> 37:54.649
Because you wouldn't be here
if it weren't for me,

37:54.673 --> 37:58.308
and you wouldn't have a firm
at all if it weren't for me.

37:58.344 --> 38:00.377
I saved both
your fucking asses,

38:00.412 --> 38:02.212
and not only didn't
you think to thank me,

38:02.248 --> 38:06.149
as far as I can tell, you
didn't even clock what I did.

38:06.185 --> 38:08.085
Now, I am a partner
just as much as you,

38:08.120 --> 38:10.721
and I am done
having to remind you of that.

38:10.756 --> 38:13.323
So the next time there's
a decision to be made, guys,

38:13.359 --> 38:15.559
you better pull up
a seat for me at that table,

38:15.594 --> 38:19.396
or I swear to God, I will break
the whole goddamn thing in two.

38:19.431 --> 38:21.632
Any questions?

38:22.589 --> 38:24.522
No, Louis, no questions.

38:25.879 --> 38:28.126
Good.

38:33.099 --> 38:34.377
Looks like
you're not the only one

38:34.401 --> 38:36.100
I'm going to have to
make good with.

38:36.136 --> 38:37.535
But what were you talking about

38:37.571 --> 38:39.204
before he came
storming in here?

38:39.239 --> 38:41.839
It doesn't matter,
what matters is

38:41.875 --> 38:44.909
what are we going to do
about Louis?

38:51.396 --> 38:54.164
- Beautiful girls.
- They take after their mother.

38:54.199 --> 38:55.565
Hm, well, I hear their father

38:55.601 --> 38:57.267
is going after
Starboard Airlines.

38:57.302 --> 39:00.170
- Where'd you hear that?
- I'll take that as a yes.

39:00.205 --> 39:04.107
- And what if I am?
- If I were you, I'd stop.

39:04.142 --> 39:06.543
And if I were me,
I'd say you're only saying that

39:06.578 --> 39:07.978
because they used to be
your client,

39:08.013 --> 39:09.244
and you're not going to like
how it looks

39:09.245 --> 39:10.711
when they become mine.

39:10.746 --> 39:13.213
I'm saying that
because Gavin Andrews

39:13.249 --> 39:14.926
is a hell of a lot more
than meets the eye,

39:14.950 --> 39:16.650
and the guy isn't worth
the trouble.

39:16.685 --> 39:18.619
What kind of trouble?

39:18.654 --> 39:22.089
Let's just say I would have
thought a guy with your history

39:22.124 --> 39:23.557
would want to be more careful

39:23.592 --> 39:25.692
about who he
gets into bed with.

39:25.728 --> 39:27.472
What the hell are you doing
looking into my history?

39:27.496 --> 39:29.696
I'm doing what you
should be doing with him.

39:29.732 --> 39:31.398
Then tell me
what you're talking about,

39:31.433 --> 39:33.533
or get out of
my goddamn office

39:33.569 --> 39:35.769
because I've got
a client to sign.

39:35.804 --> 39:39.473
Sorry to bother you, Alex.
Good luck with that client.

39:56.790 --> 40:01.125
- There's my lion.
- Are you naked under there?

40:01.161 --> 40:03.094
This is my sex robe,
isn't it?

40:03.129 --> 40:04.740
Yeah, of course, I would
recognize that anywhere,

40:04.764 --> 40:06.431
but Sheila,
where is this coming from?

40:06.466 --> 40:08.733
It's coming from right there.

40:16.309 --> 40:19.611
- Oh, my God, they heard me.
- They heard you roar.

40:19.646 --> 40:23.247
Because you are a lion.
- I am, aren't I?

40:23.283 --> 40:25.316
Yes, you are.

40:25.352 --> 40:29.120
And you should know that you're
not the only one with a clock.

40:29.155 --> 40:30.622
The dean gave you
a clock today, too?

40:30.657 --> 40:34.425
Not that kind of clock.
I have an internal clock.

40:34.861 --> 40:36.805
Sheila, are you saying
what I think you're saying?

40:36.829 --> 40:40.031
Yes, I am,
because when I told you

40:40.066 --> 40:44.735
you're the perfect man,
Louis Litt, I meant it.

40:45.462 --> 40:48.196
And I want to make
a perfect baby with you.

40:52.936 --> 40:55.803
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

40:55.839 --> 40:59.040
And I don't want to just
pull the goalie.

40:59.075 --> 41:01.142
I want to start trying.

41:01.177 --> 41:04.312
And I want to start trying
right now.

41:04.347 --> 41:06.080
This is incredible.

41:07.984 --> 41:10.518
Can we still do it dirty?
- Of course.

41:10.553 --> 41:12.086
Why couldn't we do it dirty?

41:12.122 --> 41:13.866
Because I don't want our son
to think of us that way.

41:13.890 --> 41:17.058
Louis, our unborn son
will be a Litt.

41:17.514 --> 41:19.781
He'll respect us
for being dirty.

41:19.816 --> 41:22.083
You're 100% right, we can be
as filthy as we want.

41:22.119 --> 41:24.152
- I'll get the bananas.
- What are you, crazy?

41:24.188 --> 41:25.698
You're going to be
the mother of my child.

41:25.722 --> 41:27.022
I'll get the bananas.

41:37.134 --> 41:38.900
You know, the elevators
come a lot faster

41:38.936 --> 41:41.169
when you actually call them.

41:41.205 --> 41:43.405
I was just thinking.

41:43.440 --> 41:45.373
Well, I wanted to
let you know that I finished

41:45.409 --> 41:47.242
checking on Samantha.

41:47.277 --> 41:49.044
And?

41:49.079 --> 41:51.680
As far as I can tell,
she may not be Mother Teresa,

41:51.715 --> 41:53.548
but she's an asset to the team.

41:53.584 --> 41:55.684
I guess that depends
on who the team is.

41:55.719 --> 41:57.752
- What do you mean?
- Zane promised Samantha

41:57.788 --> 42:00.522
she'd be the next name partner.

42:00.755 --> 42:03.289
And did you tell him that you
made the same promise to Alex?

42:03.655 --> 42:05.188
No, I didn't.

42:05.224 --> 42:07.638
Harvey, you can't put them
both up at the same time.

42:07.639 --> 42:09.964
It'll dilute the promotion
for both of them.

42:09.965 --> 42:11.164
I know.

42:13.435 --> 42:15.235
So what are you going to do?

42:15.270 --> 42:17.304
I'm going to do
what Jessica would.

42:17.339 --> 42:19.940
I'm going to go home,
make myself a drink,

42:19.975 --> 42:22.175
and figure out
how to get my way.
