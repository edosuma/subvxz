WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:03.537
ANNOUNCER: Thanks for
downloading this Fox show.

00:03.571 --> 00:05.739
And don't miss
all-new episodes on Fox.

00:08.742 --> 00:10.311
Previously on Empire...
I want you to write a song

00:10.344 --> 00:11.412
for Angelo's campaign

00:11.445 --> 00:13.381
and perform it at
the Captain's Ball.

00:13.414 --> 00:15.983
LUCIOUS:
He had a DUI some 20 years ago.

00:16.016 --> 00:18.219
His family pulled some strings
and got him out of that.

00:18.252 --> 00:19.253
Why you got shades on?

00:19.287 --> 00:20.888
Boy, are you high?

00:20.921 --> 00:22.490
Poor Tariq, he's jealous

00:22.523 --> 00:23.891
of everything you got,

00:23.924 --> 00:26.427
especially your memories
of your daddy.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.496
SHINE:
That's Freda Gatz.
You know, her father

00:28.529 --> 00:30.564
was locked up with Lucious
at the BCC.

00:30.598 --> 00:33.201
Seems "MM" and "BK" must have
done something for Lucious

00:33.234 --> 00:35.203
and got paid.
The question is,

00:35.236 --> 00:36.137
who is "MM" and "BK"?

00:37.238 --> 00:39.240
And as your mayor,

00:39.273 --> 00:41.542
I will not only go to sleep

00:41.575 --> 00:43.877
fighting for you,
I'm gonna wake up

00:43.911 --> 00:46.214
fighting for you.
MAN: You're in Queens, brah.

00:46.247 --> 00:47.548
You can't piss on my leg,
tell me it's raining.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.717
You come down here
for a photo op,

00:49.750 --> 00:51.452
then you limbo your bougie ass
back across the river

00:51.485 --> 00:52.786
for some uptown fundraiser.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.588
Shut him down, Angelo.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.724
He can't because
he's telling the truth.

00:56.757 --> 00:58.759
Okay--
I got, I got it, babe.

00:58.792 --> 01:00.094
How y'all doing?

01:00.128 --> 01:01.595
(crowd muttering)

01:01.629 --> 01:04.232
The name's Cookie.
Ask about me.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.300
MAN 2: We know you.
Oh, you do?

01:06.334 --> 01:08.035
WOMAN: Cookie Lyon.
That's right.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.270
MAN 3:
Where's Lucious?

01:09.303 --> 01:10.604
Oh, forget about Lucious, baby.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.072
I'm with him now.

01:12.106 --> 01:13.374
(crowd clamoring)

01:13.407 --> 01:15.743
Look here, y'all, I-I'm just

01:15.776 --> 01:18.412
an around-the-way girl
from the hood

01:18.446 --> 01:20.614
in North Philly.

01:20.648 --> 01:22.716
It looks almost
like this one, but...

01:22.750 --> 01:24.752
except for your
bougie-ass beach.

01:24.785 --> 01:26.053
(laughter)

01:26.086 --> 01:27.488
Look, my daddy was a plumber

01:27.521 --> 01:29.157
and we lived check to check,

01:29.190 --> 01:32.293
so I wouldn't be with this man

01:32.326 --> 01:33.961
if he wasn't the real deal.

01:33.994 --> 01:36.997
If he wasn't a man
of the people.

01:37.030 --> 01:38.599
(crowd clamoring)
WOMAN: Man of the people!

01:38.632 --> 01:39.833
And so what,
he went to Columbia?

01:39.867 --> 01:41.269
That makes him smart.

01:41.302 --> 01:43.137
But he still lives in the same

01:43.171 --> 01:45.339
fifth floor walk-up in Harlem.

01:45.373 --> 01:46.674
Now you try walking up

01:46.707 --> 01:48.609
five flights
in these heels, baby.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.778
(laughter, clamoring)

01:50.811 --> 01:51.845
MAN:
Hey, what about
the Captain's Ball?

01:51.879 --> 01:54.248
"The Captain's Ball"?

01:54.282 --> 01:56.450
Yeah, well,
we-we know there's a problem

01:56.484 --> 01:58.152
with the Captain's Ball,

01:58.186 --> 02:01.689
uh, that's why we've, um,
decided to hold it

02:01.722 --> 02:05.293
right here in the streets
with you guys, with the people.

02:05.326 --> 02:06.527
(crowd cheers)
Tell them, Angelo!

02:06.560 --> 02:09.363
Yes, hell yes!
(crowd clamoring)

02:09.397 --> 02:11.098
And we're going to call it
the People's Ball.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.600
(crowd cheers)
COOKIE:
That's right, baby.

02:12.633 --> 02:16.170
The People's Ball,
and you're all invited!

02:16.204 --> 02:19.373
And my son, Jamal Lyon,
will be headlining.

02:19.407 --> 02:20.874
(crowd cheers)

02:20.908 --> 02:22.876
Angelo Dubois for mayor!

02:22.910 --> 02:24.212
We'll see you then.

02:24.245 --> 02:26.013
(crowd cheers)
ANGELO:
Thank you.

02:26.046 --> 02:28.382
See y'all
at the People's Ball.

02:28.416 --> 02:29.450
WOMAN 3:
People's Ball.

02:29.483 --> 02:30.884
500 major donors

02:30.918 --> 02:32.620
have pledged to this event.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.355
Just invite them all here.

02:34.388 --> 02:35.723
Yeah, it's too late
to pull out now.

02:35.756 --> 02:36.857
We've committed in front
of all these cameras.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.326
There is not enough time.

02:38.359 --> 02:39.860
You need permits,
tents and security.

02:39.893 --> 02:42.530
And who is gonna produce
this street bazaar?

02:42.563 --> 02:43.664
ANGELO:
Well...

02:43.697 --> 02:44.865
Cookie's the name.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.367
All right.
ANGELO:
Bye-bye, baby.

02:46.400 --> 02:49.203
You're getting a little
too local, darling.

02:49.237 --> 02:51.339
Just a little too local.

02:51.372 --> 02:53.407
Oh, Mother.

02:53.441 --> 02:55.409
*

03:00.448 --> 03:03.050
* Sacrifice, determination

03:03.083 --> 03:05.253
* Ready for the world

03:05.286 --> 03:08.989
* To see

03:09.022 --> 03:10.824
* Hey, hey

03:10.858 --> 03:11.992
* Can't nothing stop me now...

03:12.025 --> 03:13.594
Hey, hey, hold up.
(whistles)

03:13.627 --> 03:15.929
Cut!

03:15.963 --> 03:17.365
Jamal, you just fell
off the stage.

03:17.398 --> 03:18.832
(sighs)

03:18.866 --> 03:20.834
All right.
(clears his throat)

03:20.868 --> 03:22.370
Look, babe,

03:22.403 --> 03:24.438
now the tape marks the edges
of the stage at the Waldorf,

03:24.472 --> 03:25.739
just follow your key light
and don't go past it.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.107
Seriously, Derek,
like I don't know what

03:27.140 --> 03:28.442
the damn tape means...
come on, man.

03:28.476 --> 03:30.077
I messed up, I'm sorry.
(laughs)

03:30.110 --> 03:31.845
Yeah, but it's gonna be
your little booty

03:31.879 --> 03:33.113
that gets busted up,
not mine.

03:33.146 --> 03:34.415
I don't even know
what the hell

03:34.448 --> 03:36.049
I'm doing this
Captain's Ball for.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.251
Why you're doing it?

03:37.285 --> 03:38.686
You're doing it
to remind everyone

03:38.719 --> 03:40.521
that you're the dopest
in the world.

03:40.554 --> 03:43.056
All right, hey, quiet.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.625
Let's--
Well, well, look at
the little pimp

03:44.658 --> 03:47.261
ready to take the
stage, like a ho.

03:47.295 --> 03:48.562
How you feeling?

03:48.596 --> 03:50.030
Amazing,
thank you, Philip.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.265
Of course.
Yeah.

03:51.299 --> 03:52.433
Listen, don't you think

03:52.466 --> 03:53.767
you might want
to do a couple

03:53.801 --> 03:55.369
of smaller venues
before jumping

03:55.403 --> 03:57.305
onto some kind of stage
of this magnitude?

03:58.739 --> 03:59.773
(sighs)

03:59.807 --> 04:00.974
Thanks for your concern, Dad.

04:01.008 --> 04:02.443
Well, it's genuine...

04:02.476 --> 04:05.379
but here, I got a
little advice for you.

04:05.413 --> 04:06.980
If you planning on doing
some of them trash ass,

04:07.014 --> 04:08.882
airing out the family
laundry or something,

04:08.916 --> 04:10.884
you'd be better off
taking a handful

04:10.918 --> 04:14.622
of them damn pills all at once
and take a permanent dirt nap

04:14.655 --> 04:16.357
and I'll see you
in the next lifetime.

04:17.491 --> 04:19.059
I'm off my meds.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.361
Good.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.064
Let's go.
All right.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.333
All right, from the top.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.969
COOKIE: So, Rockaway Beach,
day after tomorrow?

04:29.002 --> 04:30.571
Yes, thank you.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.239
Ooh, Alonzo, I owe you, baby.
(doorbell ringing)

04:32.272 --> 04:33.741
Yeah.
(knocking)

04:33.774 --> 04:35.843
I got to go, but I owe
you big time, okay?

04:35.876 --> 04:38.412
I got you, all right,
okay, bye-bye.

04:38.446 --> 04:39.847
Porsha!

04:39.880 --> 04:42.450
Yes, girl.
(giggles)

04:42.483 --> 04:44.952
Oh, I thought you
was Porsha.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.186
What the hell you
want, Lucious?

04:46.219 --> 04:48.121
I want to talk to you.

04:48.155 --> 04:50.691
About?

04:50.724 --> 04:52.693
This People Ball thing.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.828
(scoffs)

04:54.862 --> 04:56.964
Look, you sure you can
pull this thing off?

04:56.997 --> 04:59.967
Well, I didn't do too bad
with that Free Lucious concert

05:00.000 --> 05:01.369
that helped save your janky ass.

05:01.402 --> 05:03.537
Yeah, that's 'cause you're
the baddest producer

05:03.571 --> 05:04.838
in the damn game.

05:04.872 --> 05:06.540
Truth is I really do hope

05:06.574 --> 05:10.611
that the whole thing
is a smashing success.

05:10.644 --> 05:14.014
It's about time New York
had a black mayor again.

05:16.183 --> 05:17.718
Well, the lineup is

05:17.751 --> 05:20.053
a who's who of
our top artists.

05:20.087 --> 05:23.223
I'm gonna start with
a Hakeem and Tiana duet

05:23.256 --> 05:27.395
and Jamal is going to be epic.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.196
Or an epic fail.

05:29.229 --> 05:30.864
Don't you think
it's a little early

05:30.898 --> 05:32.366
to be putting him

05:32.400 --> 05:34.968
on a stage in front of
an uncontrolled crowd?

05:35.002 --> 05:36.537
I mean, something like this
could push him

05:36.570 --> 05:37.571
all the way over, Cook.

05:38.672 --> 05:39.740
Am I to believe

05:39.773 --> 05:41.409
that "father of the year"

05:41.442 --> 05:43.210
is suddenly worried
about his son?

05:44.578 --> 05:46.547
Look...

05:46.580 --> 05:49.049
Truth is, I just don't
want you to make the mistake

05:49.082 --> 05:51.552
of-of-of putting the needs
of your boyfriend's campaign

05:51.585 --> 05:55.055
(sighs)
ahead of the needs
of our son's health.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.824
That's it.
I know you, Cook.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.426
You go all in.

05:58.459 --> 06:01.762
But if this goes terribly wrong
for Jamal, and it could,

06:01.795 --> 06:03.564
you are going

06:03.597 --> 06:06.233
to hate yourself forever.

06:09.437 --> 06:12.272
* Now I had to say my good-byes
to a real good man *

06:12.305 --> 06:13.741
* A deep, painful feeling

06:13.774 --> 06:15.375
* That I never
wanna feel again *

06:15.409 --> 06:16.544
* Thought my pops prolly take

06:16.577 --> 06:18.078
* More care of his fam, man

06:18.111 --> 06:19.513
* But all he looked out for

06:19.547 --> 06:21.081
* Was Mike, Guy, and Bam Bam

06:21.114 --> 06:22.950
* No lying...
Giants kick off in 40 minutes.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.718
I'll get right to it,
Your Honor.

06:24.752 --> 06:26.920
What you just saw is authorized
FBI surveillance video of rapper

06:26.954 --> 06:29.690
Freda Gatz aka Freda Gathers,
daughter of Frank Gathers.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.792
The drug kingpin who was
chopped up in prison last year.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.360
Yeah, in those
rap lyrics,

06:33.393 --> 06:35.863
she referred to two men
who worked for her father.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.097
Both were with him in
Brooklyn Correctional

06:37.130 --> 06:39.232
when he was murdered.
Agent Cousins,

06:39.266 --> 06:41.469
if you're hoping to get a murder
indictment based on rap lyrics--

06:41.502 --> 06:45.038
This is an e-mail that leaked in
the Empire hack a few weeks ago.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.407
Uh, it mentions cash payoffs
to the families of two men

06:47.441 --> 06:49.376
identified only
by their initials,

06:49.409 --> 06:52.212
"MM" and "BK"--
now, we weren't able

06:52.245 --> 06:54.414
to I.D. them until Gatz's lyrics
filled in the blanks.

06:54.448 --> 06:56.550
"MM" is Mikey Moses,
BK is

06:56.584 --> 06:58.285
Bobby "Bam Bam" King.

06:58.318 --> 06:59.753
If you're implying that
the Gathers hit was paid for

06:59.787 --> 07:01.489
with Empire money,
get to the who already.

07:01.522 --> 07:04.224
Yes, Judge Chae, I give you
the only man with the money,

07:04.257 --> 07:06.259
the muscle and the motive
to pull it off,

07:06.293 --> 07:08.662
Lucious Lyon.

07:08.696 --> 07:11.599
Well...

07:11.632 --> 07:13.400
I've got a football
game to go to,

07:13.433 --> 07:15.402
so... I'll sign a court order

07:15.435 --> 07:18.506
freezing Empire's
assets for 30 days.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.674
It'll be up to you
to gather enough evidence

07:20.708 --> 07:22.610
to bring about
a federal murder indictment

07:22.643 --> 07:24.144
against Lucious Lyon.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.749
This smells personal,
Agent Cousins.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.317
It better not be.

07:30.350 --> 07:31.852
No, I assure you, sir,
I'm just trying to bring

07:31.885 --> 07:33.487
a dangerous criminal to justice.

07:33.521 --> 07:35.455
Hmm.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.869
You got your ticket?

07:48.902 --> 07:50.337
Here you go.

07:58.646 --> 08:02.215
I thought I felt
a certain chill in the air.

08:02.249 --> 08:05.819
So, you're unhappy about my
son's relationship with your ex.

08:07.254 --> 08:11.525
Cookie and I have
what you call history.

08:11.559 --> 08:13.360
We share three sons.

08:13.393 --> 08:15.462
She's the co-chair
of my company.

08:15.495 --> 08:18.031
So I watch her back.

08:18.065 --> 08:21.869
But, lady...
don't ever try to read me.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.971
I would never.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.940
I read books,
not graffiti.

08:28.576 --> 08:32.880
But here you are asking me
to bust up Cookie

08:32.913 --> 08:35.716
and your little...
cupcake?

08:35.749 --> 08:37.918
I have no doubt that you
would have done that already

08:37.951 --> 08:39.519
if it were in your
power to do so.

08:39.553 --> 08:41.021
No.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.556
Our campaign
has a bigger problem

08:42.590 --> 08:44.091
than Cookie Lyon.

08:44.124 --> 08:46.059
Are you familiar
with Edison Cruz?

08:46.093 --> 08:48.261
He's planning to
publish a story

08:48.295 --> 08:51.899
on the eve of our Captain's Ball
that could cost us the election.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.401
Is it true?

08:55.869 --> 08:58.772
There's always
a droplet of truth,

08:58.806 --> 09:01.575
but once that droplet hits
the water, it turns into

09:01.609 --> 09:02.710
a tidal wave.
I'd like to see that

09:02.743 --> 09:05.245
evaporate before
that can occur.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.781
So, this is what's funny to me.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.549
This is the history of America.

09:09.583 --> 09:12.219
Rich snobs like you
that I could

09:12.252 --> 09:16.023
burp their net worth,
asking men like me

09:16.056 --> 09:18.558
to do things that you
lack the courage to do.

09:18.592 --> 09:21.862
Well, now that isn't really
the history of America,

09:21.895 --> 09:23.063
but we can talk about
that at a later date.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.364
I need to know

09:24.397 --> 09:26.366
if you can persuade him
to back off.

09:26.399 --> 09:29.069
Well, I'm very gifted
at the art of persuasion,

09:29.102 --> 09:32.906
but what's in it for me, huh?

09:32.940 --> 09:37.811
Well, I could
end Cookie's romance.

09:37.845 --> 09:40.313
I know my son's
hot buttons

09:40.347 --> 09:43.050
and if I press them,
she will be incinerated.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.284
"Incinerated"?

09:44.317 --> 09:45.485
Poof.
(laughing)

09:57.831 --> 09:59.132
Anika.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.734
Hmm?

10:00.768 --> 10:03.503
What did I tell you about
never being in my bed

10:03.536 --> 10:06.006
when I wake up
in the morning?

10:06.039 --> 10:08.075
(chuckles)
Hmm?

10:08.108 --> 10:10.811
Yeah, whatever.

10:10.844 --> 10:13.313
Your little friend didn't
seem to mind too much.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.683
Ah, you weren't calling
him little last night.

10:15.716 --> 10:17.685
(both chuckle)

10:18.852 --> 10:21.121
Why don't you say hello?

10:21.154 --> 10:23.156
You are so nasty.
Please.

10:23.190 --> 10:24.457
I'm not going...
Please!

10:24.491 --> 10:25.693
Don't make me make you.

10:25.726 --> 10:26.860
(laughs)

10:26.894 --> 10:27.861
You stupid.

10:27.895 --> 10:29.797
(laughs)

10:29.830 --> 10:31.732
Yes.

10:34.668 --> 10:37.037
Okay.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.371
(vacuum whirring)

10:41.174 --> 10:42.075
Ma!

10:43.744 --> 10:45.212
What are you doing?

10:45.245 --> 10:47.848
(vacuum stops)
The same thing she's doing.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.549
But I'm sucking the dirt
out of the rug.

10:49.582 --> 10:51.051
Okay, you know what?

10:51.084 --> 10:53.687
I am not doing this, Lucious!

10:53.721 --> 10:55.723
Okay, you got a choice,
all right?

10:55.756 --> 10:57.357
It's either me and Bella

10:57.390 --> 10:58.892
or your crazy-ass momma.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.029
So you decide.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.697
I'm not going anywhere.

11:03.731 --> 11:04.865
Yeah,
we'll see about that.

11:04.898 --> 11:06.199
Mom.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.702
(vacuum running)

11:16.109 --> 11:18.879
COOKIE:
Look.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.814
I have seen
what bullets can do,

11:20.848 --> 11:23.216
so I know your guts
are torn up, Jamal.

11:23.250 --> 11:26.219
But I don't want you backsliding
because of that pain.

11:26.253 --> 11:28.756
Ma, I'm straight, all right?

11:28.789 --> 11:30.257
What, Lucious get in your head?

11:32.592 --> 11:34.261
Of course he did.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.395
'Cause if I don't get back

11:35.428 --> 11:36.730
on that stage, then he wins.

11:36.764 --> 11:38.766
No and I want you to win.
I want us to win.

11:38.799 --> 11:41.234
But not at the expense
of your health.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.203
I wouldn't be able
to live with myself.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.238
I'm all right.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.474
Completely off the pills,
I'm good.

11:48.608 --> 11:50.710
Good, that's good to hear.

11:50.744 --> 11:52.545
Then you can give 'em
to me, then.

11:52.579 --> 11:53.881
Give you what?
Give me what?

11:53.914 --> 11:55.916
The pills, boy.
Don't act stupid.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.385
All right, Mom.

11:58.418 --> 11:59.386
Yeah, all right, you off,

11:59.419 --> 12:01.889
done, give 'em to me.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.757
I mean all of them.
Don't make me come back there.

12:03.791 --> 12:05.926
I will ransack this place.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.094
You ain't ransacking no place.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.395
Yes I would.
Don't play with me.

12:08.428 --> 12:09.396
(pills rattling)

12:09.429 --> 12:10.998
That's everything?

12:18.671 --> 12:20.307
(rattling)

12:20.340 --> 12:22.042
I know you got some
in your purse.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.543
It's a murse.
Don't play with me, boy,

12:23.576 --> 12:25.145
This is not funny.

12:29.783 --> 12:31.418
Is that it?

12:33.686 --> 12:35.088
Boy!

12:35.122 --> 12:36.156
Ma, come on, all right--
Oh, come on!

12:36.189 --> 12:37.757
You come on!

12:39.793 --> 12:41.328
Yeah, all right,
my ass.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.438
That's everything.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.648
You gonna get your ass
on that stage

13:01.681 --> 13:05.118
and you gonna perform.

13:05.152 --> 13:06.753
You gonna perform your ass off.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.356
You gonna perform like
you've never performed before

13:09.389 --> 13:10.858
and you gonna do it

13:10.891 --> 13:13.660
clean and sober.

13:27.908 --> 13:30.710
*

13:30.743 --> 13:32.379
LUCIOUS:
Sure you don't want
another drink, Edison?

13:32.412 --> 13:34.381
CRUZ:
Ah,

13:34.414 --> 13:36.383
I'll have the crooked
politician, filleted.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.351
(laughing)

13:38.385 --> 13:40.553
You are really
not a fan of his.

13:40.587 --> 13:43.056
Angelo Dubois skates
'cause he's black.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.357
If it wasn't for the
color of his skin,

13:44.391 --> 13:46.359
he would never have a chance
of being elected mayor.

13:46.393 --> 13:49.029
(chuckles) Yeah, I know,
this black privilege.

13:49.062 --> 13:51.164
All us Negros,
running around here

13:51.198 --> 13:52.532
getting everything
handed to us

13:52.565 --> 13:54.001
because of the color
of our skin.

13:54.034 --> 13:55.168
You said it.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.004
* You played your cards...

13:57.037 --> 14:00.007
Are you a fan
of rap music, Mr. Cruz?

14:00.040 --> 14:00.941
* Ooh, ooh

14:05.946 --> 14:08.681
* Man, we like, you're a lame,
all you got is us *

14:08.715 --> 14:10.884
* That was dumb, we the closest
thing to the mafia *

14:10.918 --> 14:12.886
* I don't know, you tryin'
to trap the family *

14:12.920 --> 14:15.155
* Or lock us up?
That wasn't smart, man *

14:15.188 --> 14:17.057
* It's a whole lot of us

14:17.090 --> 14:18.892
* We ain't goin' upstate

14:18.926 --> 14:20.327
* Your whole team

14:20.360 --> 14:21.694
* Probably full of cupcakes

14:21.728 --> 14:23.863
* Black lives all
in your estate *

14:23.897 --> 14:27.234
* I don't know, but that's
a whole lot of duct tape *

14:27.267 --> 14:29.836
* I'll be there
in an hour, son *

14:29.869 --> 14:32.205
* Wish you had the power, huh?

14:32.239 --> 14:34.007
* This how I book 'em
for heaven *

14:34.041 --> 14:36.609
* You ain't think I knew you had
a son, what, he seven? *

14:36.643 --> 14:38.045
* Out of character

14:38.078 --> 14:39.246
* I can't believe
I'm doing this *

14:39.279 --> 14:40.347
* Actually, man, I can

14:40.380 --> 14:42.549
* All you seeing
is Ruger clips *

14:42.582 --> 14:44.517
* Choppers, ain't a analog

14:44.551 --> 14:46.719
* We-a get the whole fam

14:46.753 --> 14:47.720
* And a dog

14:47.754 --> 14:49.356
* Ha ha

14:49.389 --> 14:50.390
* Get 'em now

14:50.423 --> 14:51.791
* Ha ha

14:51.824 --> 14:52.892
* Get 'em now

14:52.926 --> 14:53.961
* Ha ha...

14:53.994 --> 14:55.228
What did he just say?

14:55.262 --> 14:57.030
He is talking about

14:57.064 --> 15:00.233
how some men can
inspire such loyalty

15:00.267 --> 15:03.103
in their soldiers that
they'll do anything for them--

15:03.136 --> 15:05.939
kidnap, maim, murder.

15:05.973 --> 15:07.307
Is that a threat?

15:07.340 --> 15:08.775
No, it's a song.

15:08.808 --> 15:11.979
You see, rap is a reflection
of reality, Edison.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.613
See, that man is speaking

15:13.646 --> 15:15.615
about a special power that

15:15.648 --> 15:18.285
has the ability to humble a man.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.988
Especially when the streets come
kicking down his front door,

15:21.021 --> 15:21.989
you know what I'm saying?

15:22.022 --> 15:22.990
So,

15:23.023 --> 15:24.891
the black gangster

15:24.924 --> 15:26.459
is trying to intimidate
a journalist

15:26.493 --> 15:28.328
for telling the truth.
No,

15:28.361 --> 15:31.131
I'm an advocate for truth
and good government.

15:31.164 --> 15:33.900
I just hate to see
our city's mayoral campaign

15:33.933 --> 15:38.338
sullied by tawdry,
unsubstantiated allegations.

15:38.371 --> 15:42.475
Angelo Dubois will never
be mayor of this city.

15:42.509 --> 15:45.278
But that's no longer
your choice, is it?

15:46.679 --> 15:47.780
* Get 'em now
(microphone feedback)

15:54.221 --> 15:55.188
Well, it appears that Mr. Cruz

15:55.222 --> 15:56.823
was easily persuaded that

15:56.856 --> 16:00.160
slanderous article he was about
to publish on your son,

16:00.193 --> 16:02.029
Angelo-- have a seat--

16:02.062 --> 16:03.796
would not be
in his best interests,

16:03.830 --> 16:05.632
seeing it wouldn't hold up
under scrutiny.

16:05.665 --> 16:08.201
Oh, that's
an enormous relief.

16:08.235 --> 16:10.370
Probably shouldn't ask how you
managed to persuade him.

16:10.403 --> 16:11.804
(phone rings)

16:11.838 --> 16:14.274
You know, the same
way I won't ask how

16:14.307 --> 16:17.310
you fulfill your end
of the bargain.

16:17.344 --> 16:20.047
Yes, that.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.482
Well, uh, Lucious,

16:22.515 --> 16:26.153
this is a report

16:26.186 --> 16:28.055
from our pollster.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.889
Until a few days ago,

16:29.922 --> 16:31.124
we were running consistently

16:31.158 --> 16:33.860
five points
behind John Meeks,

16:33.893 --> 16:35.028
then Angelo's numbers spiked,

16:35.062 --> 16:36.463
now he's two points ahead

16:36.496 --> 16:38.698
and research says it's Cookie.

16:38.731 --> 16:39.732
Cookie?

16:39.766 --> 16:41.534
She resonates
with the voters.

16:41.568 --> 16:44.137
It seems she humanizes Angelo
and lands some street cred.

16:44.171 --> 16:47.240
They're calling it
"The Cookie Effect."

16:47.274 --> 16:49.042
(hums softly)
So, does this mean

16:49.076 --> 16:50.810
that you're
backing out of the deal

16:50.843 --> 16:52.412
after I fulfilled my side of it?

16:52.445 --> 16:54.047
I don't see where
I have a choice, really,

16:54.081 --> 16:55.082
but I will make it up to you,

16:55.115 --> 16:56.716
somehow, I mean.

16:56.749 --> 16:59.552
Um, that, um--
that zoning issue?

16:59.586 --> 17:02.322
I could promise you
it'll be on the...
Nah.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.224
This ain't right.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.826
This ain't fair.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.661
What can I do?

17:08.695 --> 17:09.896
What do you want?

17:09.929 --> 17:11.931
An ambassadorship?

17:11.964 --> 17:14.734
Invitation
to a State dinner?

17:14.767 --> 17:17.937
Diana, can you imagine

17:17.970 --> 17:19.539
the number of State dinners

17:19.572 --> 17:22.008
I've gone to?

17:22.041 --> 17:23.710
We had a deal.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.578
(sighs)

17:25.612 --> 17:28.581
But I did initially
decide to help Angelo

17:28.615 --> 17:30.117
because I thought
New York deserved

17:30.150 --> 17:31.551
a good mayor.

17:31.584 --> 17:35.122
So why don't I make this

17:35.155 --> 17:38.491
my own personal contribution
to his campaign.

17:41.994 --> 17:42.929
(door opens)

17:45.832 --> 17:47.934
Dre?

17:50.470 --> 17:52.472
Dre, are you okay?

17:57.410 --> 17:58.978
Andre, you're scaring me.

18:04.517 --> 18:05.818
(exhales)

18:08.255 --> 18:09.522
I have bipolar disorder.

18:11.624 --> 18:14.761
It's a mental illness,

18:14.794 --> 18:17.063
marked by periods of depression,

18:17.096 --> 18:19.332
and periods of elevated mood.

18:19.366 --> 18:20.800
I know what
it is, Dre.

18:21.868 --> 18:24.271
What did your wife do?

18:24.304 --> 18:26.606
She took care of me when
I couldn't get out of bed.

18:26.639 --> 18:30.510
She managed my medication.

18:30.543 --> 18:33.313
She kept me under control.

18:35.715 --> 18:38.318
That's intense,
Andre, but...

18:38.351 --> 18:40.820
I'm not gonna do any
of those things for you.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.225
You don't want me anymore.

18:47.894 --> 18:51.130
I want you to learn how to do
these things for yourself, Dre.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.535
And I'm not going anywhere.

19:13.420 --> 19:16.723
She's trying to take you
away from me, Andre.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.465
"When they got me,

19:25.498 --> 19:27.300
"it wasn't at the
end of a gun,

19:27.334 --> 19:29.402
it was with
the stroke of a pen."

19:29.436 --> 19:31.238
Al Capone said that.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.572
I don't care who said it.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.307
I need to know
what's going on, Lucious.

19:34.341 --> 19:37.043
Why can't I use my credit cards?

19:37.076 --> 19:39.145
'Cause the feds have put a
freeze on all of our assets.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.480
Well, that mean
they got something!

19:40.513 --> 19:43.015
Somebody snitched!
No, not necessarily.

19:43.049 --> 19:45.184
Look, why don't you just
relax and stay calm.

19:45.218 --> 19:46.886
(scoffs)
'Cause the only people
that know about this

19:46.919 --> 19:48.321
is me and Thirsty.
You stay calm,

19:48.355 --> 19:50.323
I did 17 years!

19:50.357 --> 19:51.724
Calm down.

19:51.758 --> 19:54.761
Look, I got this whole
world on lock right now.

19:54.794 --> 19:57.630
And I promise nothing will ever
happen to you again.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.568
That was that look.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.071
You just reminded me...

20:05.104 --> 20:07.674
you were so bold.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.443
* 'Cause they just tryin'
to run the streets *

20:10.477 --> 20:12.078
* And I just want
to run the world *

20:12.111 --> 20:13.546
* When I say run the streets

20:13.580 --> 20:15.348
* Say run the streets

20:15.382 --> 20:16.783
CROWD:
* Run the streets *

20:16.816 --> 20:17.850
* Run the streets *

20:17.884 --> 20:19.185
* When I say rule the world

20:19.218 --> 20:20.219
* Say rule the world

20:20.253 --> 20:21.354
* Rule the world *

20:21.388 --> 20:22.589
* Rule
the world. *

20:33.433 --> 20:37.570
(crowd exclaiming)

20:42.074 --> 20:43.943
The first time
that you kissed me.

20:43.976 --> 20:46.613
(clicks tongue)

20:46.646 --> 20:49.382
(chuckling)
Look, I got

20:49.416 --> 20:52.585
somebody working on the
inside with the feds. So,

20:52.619 --> 20:54.654
if there is a rat,

20:54.687 --> 20:57.123
we're gonna send him a nice
little Colombian necktie, okay?

20:58.257 --> 20:59.492
Okay.

20:59.526 --> 21:00.593
(chuckling)

21:00.627 --> 21:01.861
Trust me.

21:04.864 --> 21:06.333
What's all this cash from?

21:06.366 --> 21:07.667
(sighs heavily)
You slanging again?

21:07.700 --> 21:08.635
Look.

21:09.602 --> 21:10.670
It's for the People's Ball.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.305
All of the accounts
are frozen,

21:12.339 --> 21:14.240
I got to pay the vendors
somehow.

21:14.273 --> 21:18.177
Angelo Dubois is just another
opportunistic politician

21:18.210 --> 21:19.912
with-- that
got skeletons

21:19.946 --> 21:21.314
in his closet, Cookie.

21:24.050 --> 21:27.153
Okay, just looking out for you.

21:27.186 --> 21:29.221
Okay, thank you.

21:31.391 --> 21:32.959
(door opens)

21:32.992 --> 21:34.827
(door closes)

21:37.029 --> 21:38.331
(phones ringing)

21:38.365 --> 21:39.532
What do you mean
he's on his way up?

21:39.566 --> 21:41.634
He just cleared
security, sir.

21:49.241 --> 21:51.010
You want me?

21:54.180 --> 21:55.348
Here I am.

22:03.756 --> 22:05.024
You come in here
to make a confession?

22:05.057 --> 22:06.225
'Cause I don't need showmanship.

22:06.258 --> 22:07.494
You send errand boys
with calculators

22:07.527 --> 22:09.028
to take the food out
of the mouths

22:09.061 --> 22:12.031
of my employees' children.

22:12.064 --> 22:14.233
I think I know
what you want,

22:14.266 --> 22:15.735
but you're going about it
like a coward.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.837
What I want is justice.

22:19.906 --> 22:22.308
(guns de-holstering)

22:22.341 --> 22:23.743
(quietly):
Wow.

22:23.776 --> 22:25.344
Fear of black people, huh?

22:30.249 --> 22:32.552
This belonged to our father.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.053
(people whispering)

22:34.086 --> 22:35.054
His father?

22:35.087 --> 22:36.222
Is he saying they're related?

22:36.255 --> 22:37.724
Oh, he never told y'all.

22:37.757 --> 22:38.991
Agent Cousins

22:39.025 --> 22:41.027
never told y'all
that we're brothers.

22:44.597 --> 22:46.999
Our father was
a Philadelphia cop.

22:47.033 --> 22:49.268
He was a good man.

22:49.301 --> 22:51.604
He made one mistake
and he was murdered for that,

22:51.638 --> 22:53.372
and that mistake was you.

22:53.406 --> 22:55.708
His bastard son.

22:55.742 --> 22:58.411
But as he died
in a Philadelphia street,

22:58.445 --> 23:01.581
he made me promise
to look after my brother,

23:01.614 --> 23:03.916
but he never told me
your name.

23:03.950 --> 23:08.154
I know you want to own something
that belonged to our father.

23:12.492 --> 23:14.761
This ain't what brothers do.

23:29.642 --> 23:30.877
Everybody get back to work.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.078
MAN:
You heard him.

23:32.111 --> 23:34.080
Back to work.

23:40.587 --> 23:44.256
*

23:49.361 --> 23:51.163
COOKIE:
Andre.

23:51.197 --> 23:53.232
Have you seen Jamal?

23:53.265 --> 23:54.501
No,

23:54.534 --> 23:56.302
no, ma'am.
Okay.

23:56.335 --> 23:57.670
Once you come down,

23:57.704 --> 23:58.938

right back that way

23:58.971 --> 24:00.172

Becky, Becky,

24:00.206 --> 24:01.774

Uh...

24:01.808 --> 24:03.342
Oh, he's still at his apartment.

24:03.375 --> 24:05.778
Oh, the car's been waiting
for, like, two hours.

24:05.812 --> 24:07.246
What?
Okay, I'll be right back.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.748
(crowd cheering)

24:08.781 --> 24:10.517
MAN:
And now to introduce

24:10.550 --> 24:12.351

24:12.384 --> 24:15.655

and men from WOKE!

24:15.688 --> 24:17.189

* Now we on top.

24:54.894 --> 24:57.229

Jamal?

24:57.263 --> 24:58.731
Jamal?

24:58.765 --> 25:00.199
(gasps)
Jamal!

25:00.232 --> 25:02.535
What happened?

25:02.569 --> 25:05.037
I swear I tried to get out
the door, I really did.

25:05.071 --> 25:06.673
Where is Philip?

25:06.706 --> 25:08.174
I told him don't come
because him and Derek,

25:08.207 --> 25:09.475
they're always arguing.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.343
What happened?
Did you take something?

25:11.377 --> 25:14.046
No, it's withdrawal.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.715
I've been throwing up and stuff.

25:15.748 --> 25:18.150
I am calling 911.
No, uh-uh.

25:18.184 --> 25:19.986
Can't have this
out in the press.

25:20.019 --> 25:22.822
If you not gonna go
to the hospital,

25:22.855 --> 25:25.357
then I'm gonna call
your doctor down.
No.

25:25.391 --> 25:26.893
I just need my pills.

25:26.926 --> 25:28.695
No.
Please.

25:28.728 --> 25:31.664
It's the last time,
I just got to...

25:31.698 --> 25:33.733
I got to get to the show,
you know that.

25:33.766 --> 25:36.535
No, Jamal, I'm dead-ass, no.

25:36.569 --> 25:40.773
(crying):
If I don't get there...

25:40.807 --> 25:42.675
If I don't get there,
then Lucious wins.

25:42.709 --> 25:43.943
Lucious is not the enemy
this time, he wants you

25:43.976 --> 25:45.211
to get better just as much

25:45.244 --> 25:46.879
as I do.
Lucious is the enemy, Ma,

25:46.913 --> 25:48.781
he is.

25:48.815 --> 25:50.249
Just please...

25:50.282 --> 25:52.719
You said it yourself,

25:52.752 --> 25:54.887
if I don't get there,
my career's over.

25:54.921 --> 25:57.123
It's over.
Then what?

25:57.156 --> 25:59.125
I'm not gonna stand by
and watch you

25:59.158 --> 26:01.127
become one of those
pill-popping artists

26:01.160 --> 26:03.129
who dies alone in a motel.

26:03.162 --> 26:05.131
Ma, I'm not some sort of addict!
Not on my watch!

26:05.164 --> 26:07.466
Come on!

26:09.836 --> 26:11.804
Oh, God help me.

26:18.144 --> 26:19.779
What are you doing?

26:19.812 --> 26:21.648
My daddy was a plumber.

26:41.768 --> 26:43.202
*

27:05.892 --> 27:07.126
* I'll ride in the night

27:07.159 --> 27:09.128
* On the back of your bike

27:09.161 --> 27:10.362
* With my hands, my hands

27:10.396 --> 27:13.532
* To the sky

27:13.565 --> 27:16.202
* So fast we could fly

27:16.235 --> 27:18.705
* Let's leave it behind
* Leave it behind *

27:18.738 --> 27:21.140
* So alive,
I ain't scared anymore *

27:21.173 --> 27:22.875
* Hands up *
* Hand in hand

27:22.909 --> 27:26.212
* We run, hiding from the sun
* The sun *

27:26.245 --> 27:30.717
* Under your starlight

27:30.750 --> 27:32.885
* Till the break of day

27:32.919 --> 27:36.388
* My body should stay
* Should stay *

27:36.422 --> 27:40.426
* Under your starlight

27:41.894 --> 27:44.363
* Oh, you wanna get away?
Brace yourself *

27:44.396 --> 27:45.798
* Full throttle, all gas,
just forget the brakes *

27:45.832 --> 27:47.299
* Grip your waist, yeah,
you shaped *

27:47.333 --> 27:49.035
* Like a figure eight,
let me get a taste *

27:49.068 --> 27:50.737
* For infinity
like the length of space *

27:50.770 --> 27:53.205
* Tell the haters get away
or we'll fight here *

27:53.239 --> 27:55.074
* I'm-a have your hand probably
for a light-year *

27:55.107 --> 27:57.209
* I got a lion's pride,
baby, get it quite clear *

27:57.243 --> 27:59.979
* I'm a shot of top-shelf
Scotch, not a light beer *

28:00.012 --> 28:02.715
* So tell them buds get wiser
while our love burn brighter *

28:02.749 --> 28:03.883
* 'Cause me and you are solar

28:03.916 --> 28:05.551
* We make a big bang shine

28:05.584 --> 28:06.886
* Like a supernova

28:06.919 --> 28:07.920
* Create a whole new world

28:07.954 --> 28:09.221
* And influence culture

28:09.255 --> 28:11.023
* Yeah, I'm a king
and you a queen *

28:11.057 --> 28:13.259
* Tiana, Hakeem,
they can call us TaKeem *

28:13.292 --> 28:15.427
Yeah, TaKeem!
* And the biggest power
couple ever on the scene *

28:15.461 --> 28:16.829
* And we reign supreme

28:16.863 --> 28:19.065
* Hand in hand we run

28:19.098 --> 28:20.867
* Hiding from the sun...

28:20.900 --> 28:24.236
SHINE:
Lucious, hold up.

28:24.270 --> 28:26.038
This arrangement's
not working for me.

28:26.072 --> 28:29.208
Look, I got 99 problems,
Shine, what's up?

28:29.241 --> 28:30.910
Look, I got a discretionary fund
in my deal.

28:30.943 --> 28:32.779
Now I can't access the accounts.

28:32.812 --> 28:34.180
I've been paying
for A-list producers

28:34.213 --> 28:35.581
out of my own pocket, man,
what's up?

28:38.150 --> 28:39.752
Come here,

28:39.786 --> 28:41.620
I want to explain something
to you, Shine.

28:41.653 --> 28:42.922
Right now,

28:42.955 --> 28:45.391
Empire finds itself
in the middle

28:45.424 --> 28:47.393
of a little cash flow problem.

28:47.426 --> 28:49.595
What kind of cash flow problem?

28:49.628 --> 28:51.563
Real talk?

28:51.597 --> 28:52.899
We got no liquid.

28:52.932 --> 28:54.801
While Empire buys out
a 30-day asset freeze

28:54.834 --> 28:58.137
by our buddies in the FBI,
we're stuck.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.439
Damn, Lucious, how come you
didn't come to me for help?

29:00.472 --> 29:02.441
(chuckles)

29:02.474 --> 29:03.810
I mean, how much you need?

29:03.843 --> 29:05.577
Oh, you're gonna boss up
like that

29:05.611 --> 29:08.547
and just burp out
$50 million, man?

29:08.580 --> 29:09.615
I can raise it.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.251
Liquidate a few properties,

29:12.284 --> 29:13.986
barbershops, Laundromats,

29:14.020 --> 29:16.222
stuff me and Stone
used to buy back in the day.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.057
The rest of it's in cash.

29:18.090 --> 29:19.725
Are you for real?

29:19.758 --> 29:20.993
Absolutely.

29:21.027 --> 29:22.328
I mean, being that we family now

29:22.361 --> 29:23.896
and everything, right?

29:23.930 --> 29:27.834
All right, then what's in it
for you, man?

29:27.867 --> 29:29.635
I want a stake in Empire.

29:31.270 --> 29:32.771
A stake?

29:32.805 --> 29:35.741
Do you mean like rib eye,
(laughs)

29:35.774 --> 29:38.110
T-bone? Get the hell
out of here, man.

29:38.144 --> 29:39.846
More like a seat at the table.

29:41.313 --> 29:44.316
Think about it.

29:49.688 --> 29:51.858
Well, let's think about it.

29:51.891 --> 29:54.193
Without the 50, you're
gonna have to unload assets

29:54.226 --> 29:56.195
and you're definitely
gonna lose Empire XStream.

29:56.228 --> 29:58.097
That's without question.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.099
But then again, letting
the wolf into the henhouse?

30:00.132 --> 30:02.368
That's going to lead to
a lot of blood and feathers.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.706
Roll the dice.

30:07.739 --> 30:09.876
HAKEEM:
* Let the light come down

30:09.909 --> 30:12.511
* So bright
* So bright like "Ow"

30:12.544 --> 30:14.213
TIANA: * Fast life
HAKEEM:
* Yeah, we won't slow down

30:14.246 --> 30:16.515
* Tonight.

30:16.548 --> 30:17.716
(laughs)

30:17.749 --> 30:19.185
(crowd cheering)

30:23.255 --> 30:24.891
CROWD (chanting):
TaKeem! TaKeem! TaKeem!

30:24.924 --> 30:29.528
TaKeem! TaKeem! TaKeem!
TaKeem! TaKeem! TaKeem!

30:29.561 --> 30:31.363
I can't wait for
you to meet Bella.

30:36.768 --> 30:38.170
(crowd whooping and cheering)

30:39.571 --> 30:43.375
TaKeem! TaKeem! TaKeem! TaKeem!

30:43.409 --> 30:46.745
TaKeem! TaKeem!
TaKeem! TaKeem!

30:46.778 --> 30:49.015
TaKeem! TaKeem! TaKeem!

30:49.048 --> 30:52.584
TaKeem! TaKeem! TaKeem! TaKeem!

30:54.921 --> 30:56.855
ANDRE:
But she's right.

30:56.889 --> 30:59.725
Isn't she right, shouldn't
I learn to take care of myself?

30:59.758 --> 31:05.597
Do you think you can do it?

31:05.631 --> 31:09.168
If you let me.

31:09.201 --> 31:14.140
I need you to let me go, Rhonda.

31:17.376 --> 31:20.012
You are

31:20.046 --> 31:23.115
the smartest

31:23.149 --> 31:25.251
and most devoted

31:25.284 --> 31:28.520
and most ruthless

31:28.554 --> 31:31.457
of the Lyon sons.

31:31.490 --> 31:34.760
I'm the most ruthless.

31:37.596 --> 31:40.399
I'm doing what
we planned with Nessa.

31:40.432 --> 31:41.733
I got her the Fashion Week gig.

31:41.767 --> 31:43.569
I'm building her up.

31:43.602 --> 31:44.937
Just like we planned.

31:44.971 --> 31:47.539
Make her the biggest star.

31:47.573 --> 31:48.975
And then you'll
control the music.

31:49.008 --> 31:52.411
And then you'll
have all the power.

31:54.313 --> 31:56.715
I believe in you.

31:56.748 --> 32:00.219
Promise me
you won't disappoint me.

32:00.252 --> 32:01.420
I promise.

32:17.436 --> 32:21.907
And, Andre?

32:21.940 --> 32:25.844
(voice breaking): Promise me
that you will destroy that bitch

32:25.877 --> 32:28.580
that murdered me

32:28.614 --> 32:30.949
and killed our baby.

32:35.887 --> 32:40.192
Bye, Andre.

32:40.226 --> 32:41.693
Good-bye.

32:41.727 --> 32:42.961
(chuckles)

32:42.995 --> 32:44.896
*

33:03.582 --> 33:04.716
Rhonda.

33:32.344 --> 33:34.880
(indistinct chatter)

33:34.913 --> 33:36.548
MAN:
Where he at?!

33:39.751 --> 33:42.321
Looks like y'all one
act shy of a headliner.

33:42.354 --> 33:43.555
Yeah.

33:45.257 --> 33:46.558
Jamal, Cookie?

33:46.592 --> 33:48.727
Yeah, they're on their way.

33:48.760 --> 33:50.662
Does anybody have eyes on Jamal?

33:50.696 --> 33:51.730
Here we go, here we go.

33:53.799 --> 33:55.101
We made it.
How you doing?
Okay.

33:55.134 --> 33:56.435
All right now,
all right.

33:56.468 --> 33:57.603
Stay back, Lucious.

33:57.636 --> 33:59.037
You gonna be okay?

33:59.071 --> 34:02.808
Ready? Okay,
look at me.

34:04.743 --> 34:06.545
You got it.
He all right, go ahead.

34:06.578 --> 34:08.480
(cheers and applause)

34:18.724 --> 34:21.427
*

34:24.062 --> 34:25.464
Let's go, Mal!

34:29.101 --> 34:31.270
*

34:38.144 --> 34:40.546
* Feel the heat
when I ignite my fire *

34:40.579 --> 34:43.382
* Feel the freeze when my heart
turns cold *

34:43.415 --> 34:45.617
* These chains can't hold me
back no longer *

34:45.651 --> 34:48.053
* Right now I'm here
to free my soul *

34:48.086 --> 34:50.322
* When I'm up, I see the world
much higher *

34:50.356 --> 34:52.624
* When I'm down,
it don't feel so low *

34:52.658 --> 34:55.294
* I dust the dirt
off my shoulder *

34:55.327 --> 34:57.496
* Stay up 'cause
that's all I know *

34:57.529 --> 35:00.098
* Sacrifice, determination

35:00.132 --> 35:05.171
* Ready for the world to see

35:06.838 --> 35:09.741
* Hey, hey,
can't nothing stop me now *

35:09.775 --> 35:13.111
* Hey, I'm focused
doing it my way *

35:13.145 --> 35:14.913
* Through my reign,
struggle and pain *

35:14.946 --> 35:16.448
* Born to win, like

35:16.482 --> 35:18.784
* What don't kill you
makes you stronger *

35:18.817 --> 35:20.919
* What don't break you
makes you harder *

35:20.952 --> 35:23.689
* Better than before,
against the ropes *

35:23.722 --> 35:26.192
* Can't lose
'cause I'm a fighter *

35:26.225 --> 35:28.694
* Can't stop me,
not once I get started *

35:28.727 --> 35:31.163
* No foul can
take me out my game *

35:31.197 --> 35:33.532
* I see no competition

35:33.565 --> 35:35.867
* It's clear
we are not the same *

35:35.901 --> 35:38.837
* Temptation causes
interruptions *

35:38.870 --> 35:40.939
* I'm trying just
to clear my mind *

35:40.972 --> 35:42.874
* I feel the payoff is coming

35:42.908 --> 35:46.512
* I'm certain that
it's my time *

35:46.545 --> 35:48.214
* Sacrifice, determination

35:48.247 --> 35:52.718
* Ready for the world to see

* No, no, no

35:54.886 --> 35:58.190
* Hey, hey,
can't nothing stop me now, hey *

35:58.224 --> 36:00.192
* Hey, I'm focused
doing it my way *

'cause I'm a fighter *

36:13.839 --> 36:16.575

* Don't give up now

36:16.608 --> 36:18.977
* Keep holding on *
* Keep holding on

36:19.010 --> 36:21.179
* Let's show the world *
* Let's show the world

36:21.213 --> 36:23.415
* I'm ready *
* I'm so ready

36:23.449 --> 36:25.584
* Don't give up now *
* Don't give up now

36:25.617 --> 36:27.419

36:29.521 --> 36:31.857
* Let's show this world
* Get ready. *

36:31.890 --> 36:34.660
* Came fresh cold
out the strip, right *

36:34.693 --> 36:36.728
* Keep it 100
with my clique, right *

36:36.762 --> 36:39.398
Hey, give me that big bottle
of Russian vodka right there.

36:39.431 --> 36:41.032
With shot glasses.

36:41.066 --> 36:43.502
Shine, look out, man.

36:43.535 --> 36:45.937
* Ooh-la-la-la

36:45.971 --> 36:47.339
* La-la-la...

36:47.373 --> 36:49.375
Tariq, we got
to stop meeting like this.

36:49.408 --> 36:51.277
Yeah, well, what's the point in
helping me get enough evidence

36:51.310 --> 36:53.011
to freeze up
Empire's assets,

36:53.044 --> 36:55.581
then you spotting Lucious
the money to outrun me?

36:55.614 --> 36:58.016
No point.
Maybe you just got played.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.618
Yeah, well, Lucious
got played, too.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.052
What's stopping me
from telling him?

37:01.086 --> 37:03.755
Well, then everybody
will know you got played,

37:03.789 --> 37:05.457
including the FBI.

37:05.491 --> 37:07.726
And don't give me that you
gonna take my immunity mess,

37:07.759 --> 37:10.028
because I know you can't
do that-- it's too late.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.897
You know, if you was
a real G, Leslie,

37:11.930 --> 37:13.532
you'd have started
your own label

37:13.565 --> 37:14.733
with that 50 mil.

37:14.766 --> 37:18.970
Well, Tariq,
it ain't about the label.

37:19.004 --> 37:21.039
It's about Empire.

37:21.072 --> 37:22.908
It's the crown jewel
of all labels.

37:22.941 --> 37:26.478
It's the Iron Throne.
Everybody want to be king.

37:26.512 --> 37:27.713
Don't you?

37:27.746 --> 37:29.214
* Cîroc shots in the air *

37:29.247 --> 37:31.216
* Talkin' 'bout me
and my team... *

37:31.249 --> 37:33.385
Uh, why you wasting
my liquor like that, man?

37:33.419 --> 37:35.887
Come on, Tariq.
Why you mad?

37:35.921 --> 37:38.056
* Came from the bottom
like loose change *
(laughs)

37:38.089 --> 37:40.225
* Jumpin' on these suckas, 23.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.494
* What don't kill you
makes you stronger *

37:42.528 --> 37:44.830
* What don't break you
makes you harder *

37:44.863 --> 37:47.333
* Better than before,
against the ropes *

37:47.366 --> 37:49.501
* Can't lose
'cause I'm a fighter *

37:49.535 --> 37:51.570
* 'Cause I'm a fighter

37:51.603 --> 37:53.238
(cheers and applause)

37:53.271 --> 37:54.640
Aah!

38:03.114 --> 38:05.484
That was good, right?
Yes. It was great, baby.

38:05.517 --> 38:06.852
You did a good job.
Thank you.

38:06.885 --> 38:08.086
I'm so proud of you.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.522
Thank you for coming.
Of course, come on.

38:10.556 --> 38:12.424
I love you.
I love you, too. Hey!

38:12.458 --> 38:14.460
Hey.
(laughing)

38:14.493 --> 38:16.728
You're going to rehab, okay?

38:17.796 --> 38:20.332
What?

38:22.067 --> 38:25.070
Bro, just... just go.

38:29.908 --> 38:31.610
Ma, please don't do
this to me right now.

38:31.643 --> 38:33.111
Jamal...
Don't touch me.

38:33.144 --> 38:34.846
All right?
Don't touch me.

38:40.419 --> 38:42.421
It's time, son.

39:02.240 --> 39:04.810
DIANA: Our instant-polling
was very encouraging.

39:04.843 --> 39:08.213
And the money we raised.

39:08.246 --> 39:10.181
Look, when he
gets out of there,

39:10.215 --> 39:11.917
he's going to thank you
for what you did.

39:11.950 --> 39:14.553
Believe that.
I hope so.

39:14.586 --> 39:17.088
Look, you'd better go,

39:17.122 --> 39:19.425
Your man's waiting.

39:21.126 --> 39:22.528
Hey.

39:23.962 --> 39:25.330
How's Jamal?

39:25.363 --> 39:26.765
He's gonna be all right.

39:26.798 --> 39:28.567
You're amazing.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.101
Thank you.

39:31.737 --> 39:33.605
LUCIOUS:
Ooh, Councilman.

39:33.639 --> 39:35.907
I have a gift for you
I forgot to give you.

39:38.043 --> 39:41.079
What is this...?
Councilman... can I have a word?

39:41.112 --> 39:42.380
No, no, no, no, no...

39:42.414 --> 39:44.683
That little droplet turned into

39:44.716 --> 39:45.617
a mighty big ripple.

39:46.985 --> 39:48.286
What?
What do you remember
about the evening

39:48.319 --> 39:50.288
of October 5, 1988?

39:50.321 --> 39:52.157
You're as wretched
as they say you are.
Mother.

39:53.959 --> 39:57.295
It's the, uh,
night of my DUI.

39:57.328 --> 39:59.531
I was 17 years old...

39:59.565 --> 40:01.032
Okay, wait.
Wait a minute.

40:01.066 --> 40:04.235
Every teenager has
gotten into some nonsense.

40:04.269 --> 40:07.739
"W" was arrested
for a DUI.

40:07.773 --> 40:09.541
Bill Clinton
smoked marijuana.

40:09.575 --> 40:11.376
Babe...
Barack Obama wrote
about it in his book.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.479
Yes, well, to the best
of my knowledge,

40:13.512 --> 40:16.381
none of those presidents ever
drunk-drove into a lake,

40:16.414 --> 40:17.949
saving himself while leaving

40:17.983 --> 40:19.585
a poor, innocent girl to drown.

40:19.618 --> 40:21.086
What?
DIANA: That's a lie!

40:21.119 --> 40:22.387
ANGELO: Cookie, that's not
what happened.

40:22.420 --> 40:23.421
Shameful.

40:24.456 --> 40:26.492
I warned you.

40:29.294 --> 40:30.462
That's enough.

40:33.632 --> 40:35.934
(sighs)

40:41.973 --> 40:44.610
* Slow-motion

40:44.643 --> 40:48.446
* I gotta hit it slow-motion

40:48.480 --> 40:50.782
* Yeah, yeah, slow-motion

40:53.051 --> 40:54.953
* I gotta hit it slow-motion

40:54.986 --> 40:57.489
* Sippin' on my double cup,
call me... *

40:57.523 --> 40:59.024
I'm the most ruthless.

40:59.057 --> 41:00.959
The most ruthless.
Baby, I'm the most ruthless.

41:00.992 --> 41:02.961
God.

41:02.994 --> 41:05.163
WOMAN: Shine, let's go.
The most ruthless.

41:05.196 --> 41:06.297
I'm the most ruthless.

41:06.331 --> 41:09.167
(laughter)

41:09.200 --> 41:10.602
I told 'em it was
closing time.

41:10.636 --> 41:12.337
They don't listen. They even
took over the music.

41:12.370 --> 41:13.872
* I ... in so many ways

41:13.905 --> 41:15.440
It's awful late, fellas.

41:15.473 --> 41:17.375
Shouldn't you boys
be home in bed?

41:17.408 --> 41:18.877
* They say about me...
Ah.

41:18.910 --> 41:20.378
You kicking us out, bro?

41:20.411 --> 41:22.548
I mean, they could've
at least sent the police,

41:22.581 --> 41:24.516
somebody with some
real muscle.

41:24.550 --> 41:25.884
(laughter)

41:25.917 --> 41:28.453
I'm not trying
to kick you out, Shine.

41:28.486 --> 41:30.556
As a matter of fact, I'm here
to join the celebration.

41:30.589 --> 41:33.124
That's what this is,
right, a celebration?

41:33.158 --> 41:34.726
Ladies and gentlemen,

41:34.760 --> 41:36.695
let's toast
to my man Shine.

41:36.728 --> 41:37.896
OTHERS:
To Shine!

41:37.929 --> 41:39.497
Hell of a power move
you made, brother.

41:39.531 --> 41:40.999
Hell of a move.

41:41.032 --> 41:44.703
* Sippin' on this codeine
and Sprite *

41:44.736 --> 41:47.372
* I'm leanin'

41:47.405 --> 41:48.373
* She leans on me...

41:48.406 --> 41:50.542
You know...

41:50.576 --> 41:53.044
Nessa said you was out
your rabbit-ass mind,

41:53.078 --> 41:54.379
but that's okay.

41:54.412 --> 41:55.581
I deal with a lot
of crazy dudes--

41:55.614 --> 41:56.582
a lot crazier than you.

41:58.383 --> 42:01.720
Listen, what do you think
my father would do

42:01.753 --> 42:03.054
if he knew you were
the one who set him up

42:03.088 --> 42:05.857
for the asset freeze?

42:05.891 --> 42:07.225
I had nothing
to do with that.

42:07.258 --> 42:08.660
I can prove
that you leveraged

42:08.694 --> 42:10.762
all your Laundromats
and parking garages

42:10.796 --> 42:12.564
and strip clubs,

42:12.598 --> 42:15.333
all your properties-- if that's
what you want to call it--

42:15.366 --> 42:17.335
two weeks before
Tariq and the FBI

42:17.368 --> 42:18.670
froze Empire's accounts.

42:18.704 --> 42:20.839
So what?
"So what?"

42:20.872 --> 42:23.675
That means you knew
it was coming.

42:23.709 --> 42:27.178
That means you
tipped off Tariq.

42:27.212 --> 42:30.015
My father respects
his opponents, Shine,

42:30.048 --> 42:31.549
but he hates a snitch.

42:31.583 --> 42:34.953
Let's say you can prove
this crazy theory you got.

42:36.922 --> 42:39.725
Tell him.
Tell Lucious.

42:40.892 --> 42:43.028
Let's see
what happens next.

42:43.061 --> 42:44.696
* I've been ... round
for a minute... *

42:44.730 --> 42:46.798
I got a much better plan
than that, brother.

42:46.832 --> 42:49.400
Come over here,
I'll tell you about it.

42:56.141 --> 42:57.876
Here's how it's gonna work
from here on out.

42:57.909 --> 43:00.145
You respect the hierarchy.

43:00.178 --> 43:02.280
I pull the strings here,
including Nessa.

43:02.313 --> 43:05.383
Now, you do what you do,
I do what I do.

43:05.416 --> 43:08.486
We'll put the pieces in place
to cover our tracks,

43:08.519 --> 43:10.221
make all the moves
we need to make

43:10.255 --> 43:12.190
until it's time.

43:13.859 --> 43:15.360
Time for what?

43:17.663 --> 43:20.666
Time to kill my father.

44:05.476 --> 44:07.145
ANNOUNCER: You've just
watched Empire.

44:07.178 --> 44:09.915
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:11.416 --> 44:13.518
Do you two have any idea
what this number is?

44:13.551 --> 44:15.954
-Last night's winning Lotto.
-The number of cats
in your apartment.

44:15.987 --> 44:20.792
It's the amount of money
you two cost the city
working together for three days.

44:20.826 --> 44:23.394
You've been on the job 25 years.
Not a nick on you.

44:24.529 --> 44:26.331
You get partnered with Riggs
three days,

44:26.364 --> 44:29.234
you crashed two cars
and nearly got yourself killed.

44:29.267 --> 44:33.138
-You ever feel like you made
the wrong career choice?
-Yeah, the day I met you.

44:33.171 --> 44:35.907
ANNOUNCER:
Lethal Weapon. Wednesdays.

44:35.941 --> 44:38.376
Man, take
the damn shades off!

44:38.409 --> 44:40.011
Man, put the damn shades
back on.

44:40.045 --> 44:40.912
On Fox.

44:43.681 --> 44:46.818
WOMAN: Ever since Star
was little, she believed
her name was who she was.

44:46.852 --> 44:48.887
-You still sing?
-Yeah, I still sing.

44:48.920 --> 44:51.723
But I told her, fame is a trip.

44:51.757 --> 44:53.725
It ain't love,
like a lot of people think.

44:53.759 --> 44:56.862
-How we gonna be stars, fool?
-I got a plan.

44:56.895 --> 44:59.731
Star don't listen
to nobody but herself.

44:59.765 --> 45:03.601
Star is about the desperation
to get into show business.

45:03.634 --> 45:05.937
But what happens
when you get to the top?

45:08.940 --> 45:11.042
Empire has laid
the foundation

45:11.076 --> 45:13.244
for Star.

45:13.278 --> 45:16.414
We will understand
what goes into
the makings of a star.

45:16.447 --> 45:18.083
Right here, now.
And action!

45:18.116 --> 45:21.452
* I bring me
Get my, 'bout my *

45:21.486 --> 45:23.755
* Go hard
Lookin' for another like me *

45:23.789 --> 45:28.526
The world is, to a large extent,
based on Lee's experiences

45:28.559 --> 45:32.130
as a manager of talent
when he first started out,
before he was a director.

45:32.163 --> 45:35.266
It would take a Lee Daniels
to bring me back to television.

45:35.300 --> 45:37.268
I'm trying to keep you
from getting hurt.

45:37.302 --> 45:39.404
I can't get hurt anymore.

45:39.437 --> 45:41.940
LATIFAH: This is my first time
working with Lee,

45:41.973 --> 45:43.942
and it's great
to be in his world

45:43.975 --> 45:46.111
and see his vision.

45:46.144 --> 45:47.879
It's different than anyone
I've ever worked with before.

45:47.913 --> 45:51.716
-We got the makings
of a supergroup.
-Stay away from those girls.

45:51.749 --> 45:53.919
Lee Daniels is fierce.

45:53.952 --> 45:58.389
He is not afraid of dealing
with flawed people.

45:58.423 --> 46:01.559
He's not afraid
of showing complicated women.

46:01.592 --> 46:04.562
It's my new life.
I'm not going back.

46:04.595 --> 46:06.965
There's a little bit of Star
in all of us.
