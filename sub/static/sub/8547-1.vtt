01:49.874 --> 01:52.058
It's like I told you.

01:52.060 --> 01:54.010
I've always been into
pretty things,

01:54.012 --> 01:56.963
so, it makes sense that
I'd be into girls, right?

01:56.965 --> 02:02.969
That...Is...Hot.

02:06.190 --> 02:08.024
No, I can't do that.

02:08.026 --> 02:10.977
We'll go in back.
No one will see.

02:10.979 --> 02:13.145
No.

02:13.147 --> 02:16.532
No until you show me.
We had a deal.

02:17.619 --> 02:21.153
All right, then,
pretty thing.

02:21.155 --> 02:24.040
Let's do this.

02:38.506 --> 02:39.972
I'm not gonna bite.

02:39.974 --> 02:42.558
Unless you want me to.

02:42.560 --> 02:45.011
Come on in.
I want to show you.

02:46.681 --> 02:48.464
You don't trust me.

02:48.466 --> 02:50.683
Oh, come on.
You can't blame me.

02:50.685 --> 02:52.401
A girl's gotta be careful
these days.

02:52.403 --> 02:55.938
Yeah, well,
everybody does.

02:55.940 --> 02:58.190
Remind me again
why I should trust you.

02:58.192 --> 03:01.027
Well, for starters,
you've known me 3 months.

03:01.029 --> 03:02.328
Sort of.

03:02.330 --> 03:04.413
Tonight's our first
face to face.

03:04.415 --> 03:07.500
Seriously? I mean,
all of those hours online,

03:07.502 --> 03:09.502
they don't mean anything?

03:09.504 --> 03:11.003
Come on.

03:11.005 --> 03:12.955
I'm trusting you.

03:12.957 --> 03:15.091
With my life.

03:27.305 --> 03:28.888
You took these yourself?

03:28.890 --> 03:30.523
Every last one.

03:31.893 --> 03:34.026
And you named them.

03:34.028 --> 03:35.361
Ashley...

03:35.363 --> 03:36.529
Becca...

03:36.531 --> 03:39.615
When are you gonna let me
take your picture?

03:39.617 --> 03:42.485
Uh, I've outgrown
what you're into, don't you think?

03:42.487 --> 03:43.736
Maybe just a little.

03:43.738 --> 03:47.957
No. I bet you put on
that outfit right there,

03:47.959 --> 03:50.409
you'll look 15
all over again.

03:51.546 --> 03:53.329
OK.

03:54.332 --> 03:56.382
Are you ready?

03:56.384 --> 03:57.967
Oh, yes.

03:57.969 --> 03:59.251
I wasn't talking to you.

03:59.253 --> 04:01.971
What? Who the hell
is this?!

04:01.973 --> 04:03.506
You bitch!
You set me up!

04:03.508 --> 04:05.508
You know what
amazes me, mark?

04:05.510 --> 04:07.927
Is that total losers
just like you,

04:07.929 --> 04:10.262
complete cowards
who prey on children,

04:10.264 --> 04:13.015
they fall for this
every single time.

04:13.017 --> 04:15.234
You're under arrest
for child endangerment

04:15.236 --> 04:16.736
and the distribution
of child pornography.

04:16.738 --> 04:18.269
You have the right
to remain silent.

04:18.272 --> 04:20.572
Anything you say
can and will be...

04:23.027 --> 04:25.111
Sorry. Hi.

04:25.113 --> 04:27.029
Good morning.
Which floor?

04:27.031 --> 04:29.749
Uh, 6, pl--
hmm, you, too.

04:32.670 --> 04:34.787
Karaoke
at the Benjamin.

04:34.789 --> 04:36.255
Excuse me?

04:36.257 --> 04:38.624
You were singing karaoke
at the Benjamin the night it closed.

04:38.626 --> 04:40.760
I was. Good memory.

04:40.762 --> 04:43.012
Billy Joel might have died
a little that night.

04:43.014 --> 04:44.764
Sadly, he was not
the only one.

04:44.766 --> 04:47.433
He got us started, but we went on
to do a 6-song set.

04:47.435 --> 04:51.637
The eighties took a fatal hit, if I
remember correctly.

04:51.639 --> 04:53.522
Have you seen the place
that took over?

04:53.524 --> 04:54.974
It's like techno
and twerking.

04:54.976 --> 04:56.642
It's not really
my crowd.

04:56.644 --> 04:58.310
What?

04:58.312 --> 04:59.612
You don't twerk?

05:03.034 --> 05:04.483
I was--I was kidding.

05:04.485 --> 05:06.285
I don't twerk.

05:08.072 --> 05:10.906
Ah. A gentleman
and a scholar.

05:10.908 --> 05:13.492
Agent Hotchner's office is the first one
at the top of the stairs.

05:13.494 --> 05:14.494
Thanks.

05:14.495 --> 05:15.795
Good luck.

05:15.797 --> 05:17.463
Well, how'd you do
last night?

05:17.465 --> 05:18.798
3 hours again.

05:18.800 --> 05:21.333
Baby girl, you can't function
on 3 hours of sleep.

05:21.335 --> 05:22.802
Trust me, I've tried.

05:22.804 --> 05:24.637
I know, but it's better
than the nightmares.

05:24.639 --> 05:26.138
There's gotta be
something you can do.

05:26.140 --> 05:27.256
I've tried everything,
trust me.

05:27.258 --> 05:29.008
Have you tried
not drinking coffee?

05:29.010 --> 05:31.293
This is tea. It's herbal, no caffeine.
What else you got?

05:31.295 --> 05:33.679
Better be a good answer.

05:33.681 --> 05:34.980
Yeah,
that's what I thought.

05:34.982 --> 05:36.816
I know.
It surprised me, too.

05:36.818 --> 05:38.734
What? What surprised you?

05:38.736 --> 05:40.519
And?
Hotch talked to Emily.

05:40.521 --> 05:42.021
She just doesn't
want to come back.

05:42.023 --> 05:43.439
Why? She loves us.

05:43.441 --> 05:45.191
For what it's worth,
Hotch is interviewing

05:45.193 --> 05:46.659
someone we've met before.

05:46.661 --> 05:47.661
He is?

05:47.662 --> 05:49.111
How many candidates
is that now?

05:49.113 --> 05:51.113
This one makes
lucky number 10.

05:51.115 --> 05:53.282
What? See,
this is what happens

05:53.284 --> 05:55.668
when I don't sleep. I miss things.
Who is this person?

05:55.670 --> 05:56.554
Are they nice?

05:56.578 --> 05:58.490
Why is that the first
question I always ask?

06:10.017 --> 06:12.551
The, uh, piles of files
aren't usually this high.

06:12.553 --> 06:15.604
Our section chief is overseas
and we're down an agent.

06:15.606 --> 06:17.973
I heard that SSA Blake
transferred to Boston.

06:17.975 --> 06:19.808
She decided to teach
full-time.

06:19.810 --> 06:22.478
That's...noble.
Good for her.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.230
I am not ready
for that.

06:24.232 --> 06:26.398
No, I'm not either.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.400
You have an impressive
success rating,

06:28.402 --> 06:31.036
and your supervisor
speaks very highly of you.

06:31.038 --> 06:33.739
I think you'll be a valuable
asset to the team.

06:35.126 --> 06:36.709
Really?

06:36.711 --> 06:39.378
That's it? I've only
been in here two minutes.

06:39.380 --> 06:40.412
There's no
song and dance?

06:40.414 --> 06:41.714
I mean, I had a whole
thing prepared.

06:41.716 --> 06:42.748
I don't know
if you know this,

06:42.750 --> 06:44.416
but there is a band
outside your door.

06:44.418 --> 06:45.918
Your 8 years
with the Bureau

06:45.920 --> 06:48.637
and your undercover work
convinced me that you'll fit right in.

06:48.639 --> 06:50.756
Any questions?

06:50.758 --> 06:53.642
Sometimes it takes me
2 or 3 months

06:53.644 --> 06:54.760
to arrest one offender.

06:54.762 --> 06:56.095
You catch a new one
every week.

06:56.097 --> 06:57.980
How do you not
take it with you?

06:57.982 --> 07:00.266
I know, I'm interrupting.

07:00.268 --> 07:01.650
Garcia, this is agent
Kate Callahan.

07:01.652 --> 07:03.102
She'll be
joining the team.

07:03.104 --> 07:05.771
Hello. I know you.
He's at it again in Bakersfield.

07:05.773 --> 07:06.822
I'll be right there.

07:06.824 --> 07:07.824
That's the third victim.

07:07.825 --> 07:08.941
We've been consulting.

07:08.943 --> 07:10.276
But you haven't made
the trip to California?

07:10.278 --> 07:11.577
We're about to.
You have a go bag?

07:11.579 --> 07:14.580
I am like a boy scout,
sir. Always prepared.

07:14.582 --> 07:16.115
Good to hear.

07:17.251 --> 07:19.335
Everyone, this is
SSA Kate Callahan

07:19.337 --> 07:21.253
from Andy Swan's unit.
She'll be joining the team.

07:21.255 --> 07:22.755
Thanks. Hi.
Congratulations.

07:22.757 --> 07:24.290
How are Andy
and Seaver doing?

07:24.292 --> 07:25.424
Oh, they're great
and they say hello.

07:25.426 --> 07:26.375
Welcome, welcome.

07:26.377 --> 07:27.793
Yes, we can.
We can get started.

07:27.795 --> 07:29.461
The mad butcher
of Bakersfield

07:29.463 --> 07:31.263
has left another torso
in the desert.

07:31.265 --> 07:33.766
This brings the body
count to 3 this month

07:33.768 --> 07:35.351
and still none of them
have been identified.

07:35.353 --> 07:37.469
At this pace
he's going for a record.

07:37.471 --> 07:39.722
Yeah, and quite the imagery.
What's he trying to say?

07:39.724 --> 07:42.308
A torso by itself
has no life.

07:42.310 --> 07:43.442
Right. It can't survive.

07:43.444 --> 07:44.610
It might be how
he sees himself.

07:44.612 --> 07:46.695
It could also be a simple
forensic countermeasure.

07:46.697 --> 07:49.315
He dumps the torso
after getting rid of all the pieces

07:49.317 --> 07:50.449
that can identify
his victims.

07:50.451 --> 07:51.817
That would make sense
for someone

07:51.819 --> 07:53.118
who's criminally
sophisticated,

07:53.120 --> 07:55.154
but this guy's leaving
his DNA all over the torsos.

07:55.156 --> 07:57.573
Well, we've kept tabs in CODIS.
He's not in any system.

07:57.575 --> 08:00.492
But it's still a risk
for him and taunt to us.

08:00.494 --> 08:01.794
Hey, Einstein.

08:01.796 --> 08:02.995
You're awfully quiet.

08:02.997 --> 08:05.247
I'm just reading here
the M.E. thinks

08:05.249 --> 08:07.916
the victims were alive for 48 hours
while he disarticulates.

08:07.918 --> 08:10.719
That means the unsub's
sexual gratification comes from cutting.

08:10.721 --> 08:12.054
Exactly. He wouldn't
go to these extremes

08:12.056 --> 08:13.389
if he were merely
discarding the limbs.

08:13.391 --> 08:14.673
He obviously enjoys
the ritual.

08:14.675 --> 08:15.841
It's some kind of torture.

08:15.843 --> 08:17.009
So if it isn't about
easy disposal,

08:17.011 --> 08:18.260
the limbs could be
his trophies.

08:18.262 --> 08:19.712
He'd need preserving
agents and isolation.

08:19.714 --> 08:22.314
Garcia, come up with a list of suppliers
in Southern California.

08:22.316 --> 08:24.183
We'll cross that with
a geographical profile when we have it.

08:24.185 --> 08:25.851
Keywords sodium dioxide
and silicate.

08:25.853 --> 08:27.152
You're the best.
Thank you.

08:27.154 --> 08:29.855
Yes, sir.
Tell them we're on our way.

08:36.030 --> 08:38.246
Corey! Gonna be late.

08:38.249 --> 08:40.198
Coming, dad!

08:41.719 --> 08:44.787
6 fundamental themes
of geography. Go.

08:44.789 --> 08:47.356
Location, place,
human environmental interactions,

08:47.358 --> 08:48.507
movement, and regions.

08:48.509 --> 08:50.209
Yeah, you got it.

08:50.211 --> 08:52.127
Have a great day, buddy.

08:52.129 --> 08:53.879
Thanks, Dad.

10:50.652 --> 10:53.486
100 bucks says we have
the media to thank for that one.

10:53.488 --> 10:55.622
This is Los Angeles.
They make everything a spectacle.

10:55.624 --> 10:57.290
I'm sure he's
getting off on it.

10:57.292 --> 10:58.908
They always do.

10:58.910 --> 11:00.543
He spared the second victim
the mutilations,

11:00.545 --> 11:02.412
but the first and latest
are covered.

11:02.414 --> 11:04.664
There's no clear purpose.
Maybe he's experimenting.

11:04.666 --> 11:07.717
Or he's trying to remove something
that could identify those victims,

11:07.719 --> 11:08.918
like tattoos, birthmarks.

11:08.920 --> 11:10.220
Still hard to believe
we can't I.D. a torso.

11:10.222 --> 11:11.638
I mean, back in the day
I'd get it,

11:11.640 --> 11:13.890
but nowadays everyone
might as well have a microchip.

11:13.892 --> 11:16.559
Cutting that first victim
seems extreme.

11:16.561 --> 11:18.595
I wonder if he's linked
to him somehow.

11:18.597 --> 11:21.097
None of the victims matched
any missing persons reports

11:21.099 --> 11:22.682
and were likely chosen
for their anonymity.

11:22.684 --> 11:24.984
Southern California's notorious for its
transient community.

11:24.986 --> 11:27.770
Going after high-risk
victims makes sense for this guy.

11:27.772 --> 11:29.606
I mean, there's nothing
about him that's particularly unique.

11:29.608 --> 11:31.024
Except he first
attacked a male

11:31.026 --> 11:32.692
and then moved on
to females.

11:32.694 --> 11:34.444
That's strange, 'cause
a fantasy this advanced

11:34.446 --> 11:36.279
is usually specific
to one type.

11:36.281 --> 11:38.915
Well, there was no DNA
left on this male victim.

11:38.917 --> 11:41.868
So it isn't overtly sexual
like his other victims.

11:41.870 --> 11:45.255
So he's either a victim
of opportunity or necessity.

11:45.257 --> 11:47.757
3 victims in a month
means he's got something to prove.

11:47.759 --> 11:49.459
Either to himself
or the rest of us.

11:49.461 --> 11:53.179
All right, when we land, Morgan, you
and Reid go to the medical examiner.

11:53.181 --> 11:55.098
Dave and Kate go to
the latest disposal site.

11:55.100 --> 11:58.635
And JJ and I will get set up
with lieutenant Banks at the P.D.

12:01.389 --> 12:03.806
No head, hands, prints,
or dental records.

12:03.808 --> 12:05.391
He's not making it easy.

12:05.393 --> 12:07.360
What do you know
about this victim?

12:07.362 --> 12:09.145
I haven't completed
the internal exam yet,

12:09.147 --> 12:11.447
but if she's anything
like the others,

12:11.449 --> 12:14.484
she'll have traces of some leather
particulate in her stomach.

12:14.486 --> 12:17.036
So maybe he gags them
with a belt as he tortures?

12:17.038 --> 12:18.621
He's definitely
a sexual sadist.

12:18.623 --> 12:19.806
That's my guess.

12:19.808 --> 12:22.325
What I know for sure is
she's got a good muscle tone

12:22.327 --> 12:24.627
and even has tan lines
from a sports bra,

12:24.629 --> 12:25.795
indicating she's active.

12:25.797 --> 12:27.997
Both females were in
shape, not malnourished?

12:27.999 --> 12:28.999
No.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.667
It's unlikely
they were transients.

12:30.669 --> 12:32.418
What do we know
about the offender?

12:32.420 --> 12:34.337
He has a decent knowledge
of the anatomy.

12:34.339 --> 12:35.838
You think he has
medical training?

12:35.840 --> 12:39.559
Not necessarily.
He could be a butcher or a hunter.

12:39.561 --> 12:41.678
The first step
in amputation is ligating

12:41.680 --> 12:44.764
the supplying artery and vein,
which the offender did.

12:44.766 --> 12:45.919
Well, that would make sense
if he's trying to keep them

12:45.943 --> 12:47.130
alive for the torture.

12:47.131 --> 12:49.364
The next step would involve
and oscillating saw,

12:49.366 --> 12:51.666
but he opted for
a long-angled blade.

12:51.668 --> 12:53.918
And he's have to be pretty strong
to make a clean cut like that.

12:53.920 --> 12:55.303
Absolutely.

12:55.305 --> 12:57.088
And they're identical
on each victim.

12:57.090 --> 12:59.557
The decapitation
was one swift, clean cut

12:59.559 --> 13:01.476
between the second
and third vertebra.

13:01.478 --> 13:02.760
No hesitation.

13:02.762 --> 13:05.096
He's methodical.
This is a mutilation.

13:05.098 --> 13:07.181
He followed a line
like a surgeon would

13:07.183 --> 13:08.650
for breast augmentation.

13:08.652 --> 13:11.653
She has scar tissue
that looks about 5 years old.

13:11.655 --> 13:14.155
He removed her implants
because he knew

13:14.157 --> 13:17.025
we could trace her
via the serial number.

13:17.027 --> 13:19.360
This guy's smarter
than we thought.

13:19.362 --> 13:24.115
You led the Ludwig investigation
in upstate New York.

13:24.117 --> 13:26.501
Nasty piece of work, that guy.
You know the story?

13:26.503 --> 13:28.369
Well, it was
all over the news.

13:28.371 --> 13:29.787
I saw the arrest.

13:29.789 --> 13:33.875
He was all busted up,
broken nose and everything.

13:33.877 --> 13:35.677
Yeah, well,
that's what happens

13:35.679 --> 13:37.178
when they trip over
their feet, right?

13:37.180 --> 13:39.714
Oh, yeah, I've seen
that happen before.

13:39.716 --> 13:42.684
I know that case
couldn't have been easy.

13:42.686 --> 13:46.688
When you find one that is,
let me know.

13:50.694 --> 13:52.694
All the dump sites
are pretty isolated,

13:52.696 --> 13:54.645
but this one
takes the cake.

13:54.647 --> 13:58.199
Yeah, he could have
buried the torso, but look.

13:58.201 --> 14:01.235
He laid her right here.

14:01.237 --> 14:02.737
Maybe it's remorse?

14:02.739 --> 14:05.707
He tortures them
for 48 hours,

14:05.709 --> 14:09.627
feels bad afterward,
and then lays them to rest.

14:09.629 --> 14:11.579
It doesn't sound much like
a sadist, does it?

14:11.581 --> 14:12.630
Mm-mmm.

14:12.632 --> 14:13.915
It's not just that.

14:13.917 --> 14:15.333
This guy is compulsive.

14:15.335 --> 14:17.585
He can't shut it off.
He's counting down the hours

14:17.587 --> 14:19.971
until his next kill.
So...

14:19.973 --> 14:23.091
What does he do
to pass the time?

14:26.012 --> 14:28.646
He obsesses.

14:28.648 --> 14:29.764
He's not disposing them.

14:29.766 --> 14:31.599
He's displaying them.

14:31.601 --> 14:33.317
It's part of his fantasy.

14:33.319 --> 14:37.772
We need to set up surveillance
at all the other sites.

14:37.774 --> 14:40.191
He's revisiting.

14:40.193 --> 14:42.026
The disposal sites
are within 5 miles,

14:42.028 --> 14:43.661
but until we know
the abduction sites,

14:43.663 --> 14:45.496
it's hard to know
how big his comfort zone is.

14:45.498 --> 14:48.116
Transients, they tend
to gather in that area.

14:51.955 --> 14:53.171
We're gonna need
surveillance teams

14:53.173 --> 14:54.372
at each of
the disposal sites.

14:54.374 --> 14:55.590
What are we looking for?

14:55.592 --> 14:57.091
CSI, they already
scoured the place.

14:57.093 --> 14:58.259
They didn't find a thing.

14:58.261 --> 14:59.844
He could be coming back
to relive the crimes.

14:59.846 --> 15:01.395
It explains the DNA
on the torsos.

15:01.397 --> 15:03.181
Two-man teams good enough?

15:03.183 --> 15:06.017
It works for us. Thanks.

15:24.737 --> 15:27.989
Well, pretty boy here figured out
how to I.D. the latest Vic.

15:27.991 --> 15:29.957
We had Garcia match
body type and weight

15:29.959 --> 15:32.326
with local missing women
who also had surgeries.

15:32.328 --> 15:34.662
Her name's Kim Eakle.
She recently moved to California.

15:34.664 --> 15:36.547
She's single.
Parents just reported her missing.

15:36.549 --> 15:37.632
And where's she from?

15:37.634 --> 15:39.000
Riverside. But we have
no way of knowing

15:39.002 --> 15:40.384
where or when
she was taken.

15:40.386 --> 15:42.503
This is all over the news.
Everyone's hyper-vigilant.

15:42.505 --> 15:44.555
You think he's got some
kind of ruse to get her?

15:44.557 --> 15:48.092
More like he knocks her out.
Nothing about this guy says charming.

15:48.094 --> 15:50.428
Garcia, where are we
on the preservatives?

15:50.430 --> 15:52.763
Who knew that Southern
California was a hub for silica gel?

15:52.765 --> 15:56.350
I've got a dozen places
shipping regularly to a few residences.

15:56.352 --> 15:58.820
He needs isolation.
Do any of the residences have basements

15:58.822 --> 16:00.188
or detached garages?

16:00.190 --> 16:02.607
No basements,
but two have garages.

16:02.609 --> 16:03.825
Any of them single men?

16:03.827 --> 16:05.276
I wish that they were,
then they'd be doing

16:05.278 --> 16:06.777
their silica weirdness
family free.

16:06.779 --> 16:09.197
Both of them are married
with children, actually.

16:09.199 --> 16:11.199
Yep, done.
All right, send the addresses.

16:22.679 --> 16:24.378
Corey, what are you
doing in here?

16:24.380 --> 16:25.796
I just need to get
a screwdriver

16:25.798 --> 16:27.682
to get the batteries
out of the remote.

16:27.684 --> 16:29.851
Well, I told you
I would get it.

16:29.853 --> 16:30.853
Give me that.

16:30.854 --> 16:33.387
Jeez, sorry, Dad.

16:33.389 --> 16:36.440
Look, you can't watch TV until
you've done your homework, anyway.

16:36.442 --> 16:39.026
I finished.

16:39.028 --> 16:41.729
Go. Be in in a minute.

17:08.840 --> 17:10.758
What can I do for you,
officers?

17:10.760 --> 17:11.726
Agents.

17:11.728 --> 17:13.227
Callahan and Rossi,
FBI.

17:13.229 --> 17:15.012
Oh. My apologies.

17:15.013 --> 17:17.231
You must have worked
extra hard to get that badge.

17:17.233 --> 17:18.566
We all did.

17:18.568 --> 17:21.435
You buy large quantities
of preservatives.

17:21.436 --> 17:24.155
Um..Is that a question?

17:24.156 --> 17:26.406
May we take a look
at your supply?

17:26.409 --> 17:29.777
Uh, why? Is there
something that's tainted?

17:29.779 --> 17:30.828
No, sir.

17:30.830 --> 17:32.914
Is it a threat
to me and my family?

17:32.916 --> 17:34.498
Well, then I'm sorry,
no.

17:34.500 --> 17:35.783
But that is my
private property,

17:35.785 --> 17:37.168
and for you to
come into my home,

17:37.170 --> 17:38.886
you're gonna need
a search warrant.

17:38.888 --> 17:41.289
Shoot, I knew
we forgot something.

17:41.291 --> 17:44.292
Well, I have to help my son
with his homework.

17:44.294 --> 17:46.177
- Yeah.
- Afternoon.

17:47.463 --> 17:50.298
When we arrest that guy,
do you mind if I do the honors?

17:50.300 --> 17:52.600
We might have to flip
for it.

18:27.670 --> 18:29.170
You're on private property,

18:29.172 --> 18:31.172
so we have probable cause
to search your vehicle.

18:31.174 --> 18:33.174
Get out of the car.

18:36.179 --> 18:37.395
We got one.

18:37.397 --> 18:39.347
Let's pop the trunk.

18:41.651 --> 18:44.185
Turn around and put
your hands on your head.

18:44.187 --> 18:47.488
Hey, you can't go back there!
Get away from there!

18:47.490 --> 18:49.023
Just keep quiet.

18:49.025 --> 18:51.359
You have no right!

18:51.361 --> 18:53.527
Hotch.

19:10.712 --> 19:12.545
Is my wife here?

19:12.547 --> 19:14.764
Yes.

19:14.766 --> 19:16.099
My son?

19:16.101 --> 19:18.134
He's at home.

19:18.136 --> 19:19.953
When his friends hear
about this on the news,

19:19.955 --> 19:23.056
he'll have
a lot of questions.

19:23.058 --> 19:24.691
You enjoying this?

19:24.693 --> 19:26.276
Not in the least.

19:26.278 --> 19:27.861
Because your whole approach
seems callous to me.

19:27.863 --> 19:30.814
Ohh. You're a judger.

19:30.816 --> 19:32.949
That is really something.

19:32.951 --> 19:34.117
Don't you just love that?

19:34.119 --> 19:36.236
What's with your hatred
of women?

19:36.238 --> 19:38.738
I don't hate women.

19:38.740 --> 19:42.075
So holding on to their limbs
is something you do out of love?

19:42.077 --> 19:45.328
No. Look,
I love my family.

19:45.330 --> 19:48.248
This has nothing
to do with them.

19:48.250 --> 19:49.466
You gonna tell
your wife that?

19:49.468 --> 19:52.669
You found a leg
in his car.

19:52.671 --> 19:56.323
Actually, we found 3.

19:56.325 --> 19:58.091
Oh, my god.

19:58.093 --> 20:01.845
Has your husband
been acting withdrawn lately?

20:01.847 --> 20:03.730
W-we've both been distant,

20:03.732 --> 20:07.067
but this is way more
than that.

20:07.069 --> 20:10.353
What the hell is it,
some kind of fetish?

20:10.355 --> 20:12.105
It's called
acrotomophilia.

20:12.107 --> 20:14.074
It's a sexual arousal
related to--

20:14.076 --> 20:17.944
Stop. I don't--I don't
need to know any more.

20:17.946 --> 20:20.330
Did you ever suspect this?

20:20.332 --> 20:24.084
Maybe before
you were even married?

20:25.921 --> 20:29.756
I used to work
in this retail store.

20:29.758 --> 20:33.927
Clothes, jewelry,
that kind of thing.

20:33.929 --> 20:36.212
There was a storage room
in the back.

20:36.214 --> 20:38.765
Real small.

20:38.767 --> 20:43.103
Frank would wait for me
there while I closed up.

20:43.105 --> 20:47.273
This one time I went in
the back, and he, um--

20:47.275 --> 20:54.214
he was...rubbing
up against this mannequin.

20:54.216 --> 20:55.698
Its leg was gone.

20:55.700 --> 21:00.053
I freaked out, but he
said he was just trying to fix it.

21:00.055 --> 21:02.622
I didn't believe him.

21:02.624 --> 21:05.909
But I needed to.
We were gonna get married. I...

21:05.911 --> 21:07.410
I was young.

21:07.412 --> 21:10.914
I didn't even know wanting something
like that could be a...

21:10.916 --> 21:12.632
thing.

21:18.557 --> 21:20.090
It's fine.

21:20.092 --> 21:22.092
It's your right
to remain silent.

21:22.094 --> 21:23.676
We'll just...
keep you company

21:23.678 --> 21:25.595
until your
transportation arrives.

21:25.597 --> 21:28.982
You know, I've been
doing this a long time.

21:28.984 --> 21:32.235
And the funny thing about it,
behavioral science,

21:32.237 --> 21:35.405
is it's not exact
like physics.

21:35.407 --> 21:37.440
We get surprises
all the time.

21:37.442 --> 21:39.025
Like him.

21:39.027 --> 21:41.327
You know, I bet if we talked
to all the neighbors,

21:41.329 --> 21:42.612
they'd say the same thing.

21:42.614 --> 21:45.281
Friendly guy. Maybe pick up
on some of his insecurities.

21:45.283 --> 21:47.033
A little too...average.

21:47.035 --> 21:50.370
But what none
of the neighbors would see

21:50.372 --> 21:53.373
is what a guy like him is like
when no one is watching.

21:53.375 --> 21:58.461
So desperate
to be aggressive, dominant.

21:58.463 --> 21:59.963
Yeah, this one surprises me.

21:59.965 --> 22:02.298
I mean, his fantasies
were innocent enough.

22:02.300 --> 22:04.300
Managed them
all these years.

22:04.302 --> 22:08.771
What was it that made him
snap and kill 3 people?

22:08.773 --> 22:11.641
Wait.

22:11.643 --> 22:14.060
You think I killed them?

22:14.062 --> 22:17.313
No. No, no, no.
I just bought their limbs.

22:20.952 --> 22:22.652
From who?

22:22.654 --> 22:25.155
I, uh--I don't--
I don't know.

22:25.157 --> 22:26.456
You're gonna have to do
better than that.

22:26.458 --> 22:30.326
So what did you do,
just put out a classified?

22:30.328 --> 22:32.128
Well, sort of.

22:33.665 --> 22:36.132
There's this guy.

22:36.134 --> 22:39.502
I found him in a chat room.

22:39.504 --> 22:42.338
He finds whatever it is
you're looking for.

22:42.340 --> 22:43.973
And how do you get it?

22:43.975 --> 22:47.844
Uh...uh, it's in a different
place every time.

22:47.846 --> 22:52.232
Uh, rest stops,
abandoned places mainly.

22:52.234 --> 22:55.151
I, uh, I'd leave the cash,

22:55.153 --> 22:57.937
and he leaves
what it is I paid for.

22:57.939 --> 23:00.023
But you wouldn't
drive off right away.

23:00.025 --> 23:03.359
Oh, no. I'd want to be
alone with it.

23:03.361 --> 23:06.196
You never had a chance
to meet him, not even once?

23:06.198 --> 23:07.914
Never saw a strange car?

23:07.916 --> 23:10.867
No, no. No, never. I swear.

23:12.037 --> 23:13.703
The whole thing sounds bizarre.

23:13.705 --> 23:15.088
Do you believe him?

23:15.090 --> 23:17.373
Yes. Fetishes
aren't always violent.

23:17.375 --> 23:19.375
He had a need for the limbs,
but not a desire to kill.

23:19.377 --> 23:20.960
Then who are we
looking for?

23:20.962 --> 23:23.296
Single white male,
30 to 40, living in isolation.

23:23.298 --> 23:26.466
He seeks out solitude because he
was probably raised in an abusive home

23:26.468 --> 23:28.051
and he's still
looking for refuge.

23:28.053 --> 23:29.385
Chances are he lost
his job recently,

23:29.387 --> 23:30.887
which is why he sold
the body parts.

23:30.889 --> 23:33.606
His lack of social skills
point to menial work,

23:33.608 --> 23:36.559
but his sophistication tells us he's more
intelligent than we thought.

23:36.561 --> 23:38.611
Just like Jeffrey Dahmer,
he's also deranged,

23:38.613 --> 23:40.196
but he's learned
from others' mistakes.

23:40.198 --> 23:42.232
He knows not to keep strong
smells around too long,

23:42.234 --> 23:44.984
which is why he disposes of
the torsos within a few days.

23:44.986 --> 23:48.204
There's a very good chance that he
snapped because of serious rejection.

23:48.206 --> 23:50.073
If he finally got the guts
to ask a woman out,

23:50.075 --> 23:51.553
he would have been clumsy and

23:51.577 --> 23:53.494
aggressive and she
would have pushed him away.

23:53.495 --> 23:55.912
It's why he got rid
of all the things that symbolized intimacy.

23:55.914 --> 23:57.830
It's how his
psychopathology developed.

23:57.832 --> 23:59.749
But if this is about
a girl that rejected him,

23:59.751 --> 24:01.050
why kill a guy first?

24:01.052 --> 24:02.635
He might be connected
to the second victim.

24:02.637 --> 24:05.088
But without their identities,
we can't say for sure.

24:05.090 --> 24:07.090
What about the revisiting?
Can we catch him like that?

24:07.092 --> 24:11.094
He's obsessive about these locations,
but he's probably seen the surveillance.

24:11.096 --> 24:14.480
Well, then,
what will he do?

24:14.482 --> 24:17.150
He'll find another victim.

24:54.639 --> 24:56.773
You'd think after 10 years
I'd seen it all.

24:56.775 --> 24:58.274
How many sites
are there, mama?

24:58.276 --> 25:00.610
Hundreds. And that
gem of a fellow you've got in custody

25:00.612 --> 25:03.980
has looked at all of them
at one time or another.

25:03.982 --> 25:05.982
Anonymity is huge
for these sites.

25:05.984 --> 25:08.451
They use a Tor network,
which is an onion router.

25:08.453 --> 25:10.703
The point is, you're not
gonna be able to find anyone this way.

25:10.705 --> 25:12.238
Do you know there are
actual variations

25:12.240 --> 25:13.790
on a disarticulation fetish?

25:13.792 --> 25:17.543
I need baby
kitten pics asap.

25:17.545 --> 25:20.129
Oh, have you seen the hippo
who lives with the family?

25:20.131 --> 25:21.881
Sleeps with a blanket,
what?

25:21.883 --> 25:23.583
Gets massages,
eats better than I do.

25:23.585 --> 25:24.585
Where is that?

25:24.586 --> 25:25.752
South Africa.
It's amazing.

25:25.754 --> 25:27.553
Trust me, I have
an arsenal of cuteness.

25:27.555 --> 25:29.672
Have you seen the one
with the baby elephant--

25:29.674 --> 25:31.257
oh, with the baby chicks?

25:31.259 --> 25:32.642
Yes, I love that one.

25:32.644 --> 25:33.893
Uh, hey, you guys?

25:33.895 --> 25:35.595
Sorry.
Sorry.

25:35.597 --> 25:37.647
The most recent victim
was taken from Riverside.

25:37.649 --> 25:39.432
That's more than 2 1/2
hours away from here.

25:39.434 --> 25:41.184
So his comfort zone
isn't limited to here.

25:41.186 --> 25:43.853
That's not good. He's got
a lot more confidence than we thought.

25:43.855 --> 25:46.155
He's leaving vics here, so he must
have some connection to Bakersfield.

25:46.157 --> 25:48.691
The M.E. says he's gotten
better at ligating each victim,

25:48.693 --> 25:50.360
which means
he may have had practice.

25:50.362 --> 25:51.861
On what?
We didn't originally profile him

25:51.863 --> 25:53.579
as an acrotomophile,
but that sort of attraction

25:53.581 --> 25:55.198
typically has deep roots
in childhood.

25:55.200 --> 25:57.283
Maybe the unsub grew up
around dead bodies, like a funeral home,

25:57.285 --> 25:59.001
so it wasn't that big
of a leap for him.

25:59.003 --> 26:00.753
It could be.
We know he wasn't social enough

26:00.755 --> 26:02.255
to continue
the family tradition,

26:02.257 --> 26:04.290
so maybe he found work
in a morgue or a hospital.

26:04.292 --> 26:05.375
When you say work...

26:05.377 --> 26:08.044
Security guard, janitor,
anything entry level.

26:08.046 --> 26:12.014
Uh, the UC system
has a medical facility in Bakersfield.

26:12.016 --> 26:13.516
Anyone fired recently?

26:13.518 --> 26:16.269
No, but there's an anatomy
Professor on sabbatical.

26:16.271 --> 26:17.387
Oh, what's his name?

26:17.389 --> 26:18.721
Dylan Myers.

26:33.621 --> 26:34.737
Clear.

26:34.739 --> 26:36.572
Clear.

26:46.801 --> 26:48.968
He definitely revisited.

27:25.924 --> 27:27.457
No...

27:27.459 --> 27:29.959
Get away. Oh!

27:29.961 --> 27:31.961
No! Please don't!

27:31.963 --> 27:33.429
Please don't!

27:46.110 --> 27:49.312
Let me go!

27:49.314 --> 27:52.315
Please!

27:52.317 --> 27:53.983
Please...

27:53.985 --> 27:55.902
No! No! Please don't!

27:55.904 --> 27:59.655
Please! Please don't!

28:00.708 --> 28:03.209
Aah!

28:22.883 --> 28:25.049
Landlord says he paid
his rent in cash

28:25.051 --> 28:26.518
for the first time
last month.

28:26.520 --> 28:28.553
Left it in an envelope,
and he hasn't seen him in a while.

28:28.555 --> 28:30.438
He needs privacy
to pull off what he does.

28:30.440 --> 28:32.390
Sharing walls with neighbors isn't
going to give him that.

28:32.392 --> 28:34.025
If he plays
for this place in cash,

28:34.027 --> 28:36.945
chances are it's also how he
pays for a secondary location.

28:36.947 --> 28:38.947
Yeah, but where is it?
We know who he is,

28:38.949 --> 28:41.316
but we have no idea
where he's hiding.

28:41.318 --> 28:43.284
And Garcia has nothing
strange on this guy.

28:43.286 --> 28:46.404
Well, we know he's
methodical and obsessive.

28:46.406 --> 28:48.206
And he's kept more trophies.

29:01.087 --> 29:03.087
Kid, you OK?

29:03.089 --> 29:04.556
Yeah. You?

29:04.558 --> 29:06.174
Just tired.

29:06.176 --> 29:08.893
Dr. Lee sent this over.
The most recent victim

29:08.895 --> 29:11.229
had more than just leather
particulates in her stomach.

29:11.231 --> 29:13.848
She chewed through it,
leaving entire chunks behind.

29:13.850 --> 29:15.316
And she also found
traces of horse hair.

29:15.318 --> 29:16.401
He's using a bridle.

29:16.403 --> 29:17.986
This guy could have
used anything. Why that?

29:17.988 --> 29:20.271
It's either specific
to his fantasy

29:20.273 --> 29:23.241
or something he had
easy access to.

29:23.243 --> 29:26.444
How many horse ranches
are around here?

29:48.635 --> 29:50.301
What's your name?

29:56.726 --> 29:58.526
I'm Angie.

30:02.032 --> 30:04.816
Where are you going?

30:04.818 --> 30:05.984
No.

30:05.986 --> 30:08.953
No. No, please,
you don't have to do this.

30:08.955 --> 30:10.038
Please, I just want
to talk to you.

30:10.040 --> 30:13.825
Please, I just want
to talk to you...

30:34.014 --> 30:37.682
It must get so lonely here.

30:45.025 --> 30:47.692
Let me stay with you.

30:58.204 --> 31:00.505
I didn't picture him
as the sentimental type.

31:00.507 --> 31:02.423
Cute kid.
Looks so normal.

31:02.425 --> 31:04.876
You'd like to think
they all start out that way.

31:04.878 --> 31:06.928
I don't know.
Some never have a chance.

31:06.930 --> 31:09.898
They lose the genetics
lottery right of the bat.

31:09.900 --> 31:12.133
You know, there's
no evidence of his family

31:12.135 --> 31:14.686
anywhere in this space.

31:14.688 --> 31:17.188
Maybe that's what made him
feel so isolated.

31:17.190 --> 31:18.640
Yeah. We said
he was a loner,

31:18.642 --> 31:20.275
but in all these old photos,

31:20.277 --> 31:21.943
he's surrounded by
friends and family.

31:21.945 --> 31:23.895
That doesn't fit
the profile.

31:45.552 --> 31:48.052
I'm so cold.

32:21.621 --> 32:24.255
Is that--

32:24.257 --> 32:25.790
is that better?

32:27.978 --> 32:30.128
Thank you.

32:51.317 --> 32:54.035
Tech said there's a layer
of dust over everything.

32:54.037 --> 32:56.738
It doesn't look like
he's been living here for weeks.

32:56.740 --> 32:57.872
So why did he pay
the rent

32:57.874 --> 32:59.157
if he wasn't
going to stay here?

32:59.159 --> 33:00.159
What have you got?

33:00.160 --> 33:01.409
Everything
in the unsub's behavior

33:01.411 --> 33:03.661
points to
an extreme introvert.

33:03.663 --> 33:05.129
This guy's got a lot
of family photos,

33:05.131 --> 33:07.582
has a fondness for
the Myers family crest. It's Scottish.

33:07.584 --> 33:10.968
He even has a tattoo
of it right above his heart.

33:12.422 --> 33:14.172
Hang on.

33:16.059 --> 33:17.308
That's weird.

33:17.310 --> 33:19.343
Does he have any
other tattoos?

33:19.345 --> 33:22.313
No, but a nasty surgery.
Gallbladder, maybe?

33:22.315 --> 33:23.691
It's not a coincidence

33:23.715 --> 33:25.902
that the marks that could
identify him are mutilated.

33:25.902 --> 33:27.985
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

33:27.987 --> 33:30.154
Dylan Myers isn't the unsub.
He's the first victim.

33:30.156 --> 33:33.491
So the real unsub killed Myers
and then framed him.

33:33.493 --> 33:34.792
But it's not just
a countermeasure.

33:34.794 --> 33:36.778
He took out a lot of rage
on this man for a reason.

33:36.780 --> 33:38.029
Maybe this Dylan Myers
stood in the way

33:38.031 --> 33:39.831
of the unsub's
true object of affection.

33:39.833 --> 33:41.282
Well, it makes sense
since we thought

33:41.284 --> 33:42.700
the first and second
victims were connected.

33:42.702 --> 33:44.118
Only Dylan Myers was single.

33:44.120 --> 33:46.170
Garcia, was Dylan Myers
dating anyone?

33:46.172 --> 33:48.506
He was a bit of a hermit,

33:48.508 --> 33:50.007
and like I said,
zero social media skills,

33:50.009 --> 33:52.376
did go old school
with a land line.

33:52.378 --> 33:54.662
Tracking his frequently
called numbers.

33:54.664 --> 33:58.766
He called a young woman named
Christine Locke several times.

33:58.768 --> 34:01.169
She's a former student,
lives in Bakersfield.

34:03.373 --> 34:05.223
And she's missing.

34:05.225 --> 34:07.692
Sending you her picture now.

34:07.694 --> 34:09.226
She looks like
the second victim.

34:09.228 --> 34:11.529
Did she have a restraining order
out on anyone?

34:11.531 --> 34:12.947
Checking now.

34:12.949 --> 34:16.234
Uh, yes. She filed for and
was granted a restraining order

34:16.235 --> 34:19.704
on August 6
from a Steven Parkett.

34:19.706 --> 34:20.905
And where is he?

34:20.907 --> 34:22.907
Probably on his way
to hell in a handbasket, sir.

34:22.909 --> 34:26.561
He was raised and lives
at a cattle ranch and slaughterhouse

34:26.563 --> 34:28.880
in Bishopville
just outside of Bakersfield.

34:28.882 --> 34:30.831
Sending you
the coordinates now.

34:42.594 --> 34:45.429
Can we go for a walk?

34:45.431 --> 34:48.431
It'd be really nice.

34:54.690 --> 34:58.192
You'll have to untie me.

34:58.194 --> 35:00.695
OK?

35:02.699 --> 35:05.249
Just for a minute.

36:01.062 --> 36:03.562
Parkett grew up isolated,
just like we thought.

36:03.564 --> 36:05.147
Mother died in childbirth.

36:05.149 --> 36:08.034
No siblings. The father
was a violent schizophrenic,

36:08.036 --> 36:10.286
aggravated by chronic
alcoholism.

36:10.288 --> 36:13.656
Genetics. Didn't have
much of a chance.

36:38.933 --> 36:40.766
Stop, please!

36:40.768 --> 36:42.601
What the hell--

36:42.603 --> 36:45.020
Please!

36:45.022 --> 36:47.106
Please!

36:47.108 --> 36:50.109
He's coming!

36:50.111 --> 36:51.243
Where?

36:51.245 --> 36:54.363
He's right behind me!

37:19.807 --> 37:21.774
Look.

37:24.445 --> 37:25.945
All right,
we need to split up.

37:25.947 --> 37:28.697
JJ, take the back door,
and Kate and I will take the front.

37:28.699 --> 37:31.317
Keep your eyes open.
He's gonna be close.

38:24.372 --> 38:26.839
"Just because
everything is different

38:26.841 --> 38:29.341
doesn't mean
anything has changed."

38:29.343 --> 38:31.293
Irene Peter.

38:36.350 --> 38:37.716
How many did you get?

38:37.718 --> 38:39.018
Uh, 10.

38:39.020 --> 38:41.854
Hmm. Well, uh,
vitamin E oil

38:41.856 --> 38:43.222
helps with the scarring.

38:43.224 --> 38:44.690
Have you ever tried
cocoa butter?

38:44.692 --> 38:45.641
No.

38:45.643 --> 38:47.393
Yeah. 6 stitches inside,
8 out.

38:47.395 --> 38:49.311
Guy got through the tendon.
Port authority.

38:49.313 --> 38:51.397
Tortured, last year.
Good times.

38:51.399 --> 38:52.531
Yes.

38:52.533 --> 38:55.451
Oh, and don't even
get this guy started.

38:55.453 --> 38:57.486
What are we doing?
Are we talking battle scars?

38:57.488 --> 39:00.623
Oh, yeah. I probably
hold the record.

39:00.625 --> 39:03.075
So what are the rules?
Are we just talking stitch counts,

39:03.077 --> 39:05.628
or we going full on
with like broken ribs,

39:05.630 --> 39:07.079
pistol whips, concussions?

39:07.081 --> 39:08.497
Told you.
You weren't kidding.

39:08.499 --> 39:09.915
Well, why don't we start
with the most recent.

39:09.917 --> 39:12.918
Guy hit me in the arm.
Same guy hit me twice in the chest,

39:12.920 --> 39:16.088
but I was wearing my vest,
so I only ended up getting welts.

39:16.090 --> 39:19.058
You see, these idiots, they think
they can beat me, but they can't,

39:19.060 --> 39:20.759
so they at least
try to hurt me, you know?

39:20.761 --> 39:22.761
What else? Oh,
let's not forget

39:22.763 --> 39:25.097
when I got blindsided
and thrown out a window.

39:26.567 --> 39:29.285
Welcome to the team,
Callahan.

39:29.287 --> 39:31.237
Thanks. Ow.

39:42.750 --> 39:43.916
Hey.

39:43.918 --> 39:45.668
Hey. Almost done.

39:45.670 --> 39:46.752
I figured.

39:46.754 --> 39:50.172
So, did that last victim
remember anything

39:50.174 --> 39:52.708
about her abduction?

39:52.710 --> 39:55.461
She said that she'd
gone out for a jog,

39:55.463 --> 39:58.681
she got hit over the head,
and she woke up with Parkett.

39:58.683 --> 39:59.965
She was from Bakersfield?

39:59.967 --> 40:01.717
San Diego.

40:01.719 --> 40:04.470
That's weird.

40:04.472 --> 40:07.973
I'm just surprised
that he traveled that far to hunt.

40:07.975 --> 40:10.809
You know, all those
hours in a car with a live victim.

40:10.811 --> 40:12.728
I didn't think he had
the guts or patience for that.

40:12.730 --> 40:14.813
We caught him.
There's no doubt he's guilty.

40:14.815 --> 40:16.482
I know.

40:16.484 --> 40:18.817
And nothing in the behavior
points to a partner.

40:18.819 --> 40:21.153
Right.

40:21.155 --> 40:24.239
You asked me how
I leave it at the office.

40:24.241 --> 40:27.693
When you solve it,
let it go.

40:29.180 --> 40:31.964
Easier said than done,
though, right?

40:33.000 --> 40:34.500
Sometimes.

40:34.502 --> 40:36.719
Well, good night,
or morning.

40:36.721 --> 40:38.170
You know what I mean.

40:38.172 --> 40:39.338
Get some sleep.

40:39.340 --> 40:41.507
Thanks.
Yeah, you, too.

41:30.057 --> 41:31.057
Hey.

41:31.058 --> 41:32.058
Hi.

41:32.059 --> 41:33.892
How was your first case?

41:33.894 --> 41:37.546
Long. How's the paper coming?

41:37.548 --> 41:39.098
Read it tonight.

41:39.100 --> 41:40.432
It'll cure
your insomnia.

41:40.434 --> 41:41.367
Ha ha.

41:41.369 --> 41:44.069
Hmm.
What time is it?

41:44.071 --> 41:46.071
Almost 7:00.

41:46.073 --> 41:48.407
Time for you to get up.
You want some French toast?

41:48.409 --> 41:50.759
Not yet.

41:50.761 --> 41:53.128
I haven't seen you
in two days.

41:53.130 --> 41:55.748
I know. I'm sorry.

41:55.750 --> 41:57.583
Come here.

42:00.971 --> 42:03.472
I love you, sweet girl.

42:03.474 --> 42:05.641
I love you, too, Kate.

42:27.281 --> 42:30.949
Hi. Excuse me. I'm looking for
El Segundo Boulevard.

42:30.951 --> 42:33.368
Yeah. Uh...

42:33.370 --> 42:36.672
It's--aah! Aah!
