00:03.294 --> 00:06.061
* Good morning, USA! *

00:06.129 --> 00:09.996
* I got a feeling that it's
gonna be a wonderful day *

00:10.064 --> 00:12.932
* The sun in the sky has
a smile on his face *

00:12.999 --> 00:17.102
* And he's shining a salute
to the American race *

00:19.205 --> 00:22.675
* Oh, boy, it's swell to say *

00:22.743 --> 00:24.577
* Good... * Good morning, USA *

00:24.645 --> 00:26.214
Aah!

00:26.281 --> 00:31.584

00:33.824 --> 00:35.624
Dad, check it out!

00:35.692 --> 00:38.761
I got a B-plus on my essay
about my personal hero,

00:38.829 --> 00:41.065
<i>Legolas from Lord of the Rings!</i>

00:41.133 --> 00:42.833
"Le-go-las."

00:42.901 --> 00:44.703
Yeah. He helps Aragorn conquer...

00:44.771 --> 00:46.804
"A-ra-gorn."

00:46.872 --> 00:49.107
Yeah! He's an elf,
and-and he... Hey!

00:49.175 --> 00:51.009
That's not a hero, Steve!

00:51.077 --> 00:52.910
A hero is someone you
worship and emulate.

00:52.978 --> 00:54.845
I assume you got such a high grade

00:54.913 --> 00:57.514
because your teacher thought you
were trying to come out to her

00:57.581 --> 00:58.616
and wanted to be supportive.

00:58.683 --> 01:00.017
But Legolas is cool!

01:00.085 --> 01:01.585
He can shoot arrows,

01:01.653 --> 01:04.321
his feet scarcely make
imprints on the snow...

01:04.388 --> 01:05.889
They've got to be real! Okay?

01:05.957 --> 01:07.491
Heroes have got to be real people!

01:07.558 --> 01:08.891
I'm, um,

01:08.959 --> 01:11.360
I'm ready to pretend
I'm going to school,

01:11.428 --> 01:15.263
if someone wants to pretend
to see my bus outside.

01:15.331 --> 01:17.699
<i>These are my heroes, son.</i>

01:17.767 --> 01:19.134
Real heroes.

01:19.201 --> 01:21.937
Ronald Reagan and the
1980 "Miracle on Ice"

01:22.005 --> 01:23.640
U.S. hockey team.

01:23.707 --> 01:26.075
1980 was the best year of my life.

01:26.143 --> 01:27.543
Ronald Reagan became president,

01:27.611 --> 01:30.180
and the U.S. hockey team
overcame enormous odds

01:30.248 --> 01:32.415
to beat the Russians
and win Olympic gold.

01:32.483 --> 01:35.586
And my Cabbage Patch Kid Woodrow
was born in the cabbage patch

01:35.653 --> 01:37.521
on September 1.

01:37.588 --> 01:39.122
He's not one of my heroes.

01:39.189 --> 01:41.925
He's-he's just been my best
friend since, like, forever.

01:41.993 --> 01:44.227
These men saved me!

01:44.295 --> 01:45.762
I was born into an
upper-middle-class

01:45.830 --> 01:47.097
white family in the suburbs.

01:47.165 --> 01:48.732
No one gave me a chance.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.901
But I saw these men,
these underdogs,

01:50.968 --> 01:52.869
rise up and beat the odds,

01:52.937 --> 01:55.605
and they inspired me to
climb out of the cul-de-sac

01:55.673 --> 01:57.240
and make something of my life!

01:57.308 --> 01:59.075
That's what a hero is, Steve--

01:59.143 --> 02:01.477
someone whose example
you can follow.

02:03.213 --> 02:04.780
Heh, look at that!

02:04.848 --> 02:07.149
Can you believe me and
this group of jagoffs

02:07.216 --> 02:09.351
won the gold?
What are you talking about?

02:09.419 --> 02:11.686
That's me, Chex LeMeneux!

02:11.754 --> 02:13.387
See? That's my finger,

02:13.455 --> 02:15.991
and there's my perfect,
apple-shaped bottom.

02:16.058 --> 02:18.326
Well, love to stay and chat,
but I already had

02:18.394 --> 02:21.497
half this coffee,
and matters are afoot.

02:21.565 --> 02:23.566
Aah! You lazy, selfish,
no-good drunk!

02:23.633 --> 02:26.969
How dare you claim to be one of the
greatest men ever to walk this earth!

02:27.037 --> 02:29.105
I know who Chex LeMeneux is,
and you're not him!

02:29.173 --> 02:31.207
That's 'cause you're not
seeing me in my outfit.

02:31.275 --> 02:33.643
Eh? Recognize me now?

02:33.710 --> 02:37.747
Mustache, courtesy of an L.L.
Bean mannequin, name of Frederick.

02:37.814 --> 02:39.681
Ah, an alien and a mannequin.

02:39.749 --> 02:41.517
What were we thinking?

02:41.584 --> 02:43.185
We were young.

02:43.252 --> 02:45.320
Take off that jersey!
You're besmirching the team!

02:45.388 --> 02:47.322
I'm not telling you,
I was the agitator,

02:47.389 --> 02:48.656
the enforcer, the goon.

02:48.724 --> 02:50.157
In that game versus Sweden,

02:50.225 --> 02:52.660
I was inside one of their
forwards for, like, a minute.

02:52.727 --> 02:54.161
He still writes me.

02:54.229 --> 02:55.929
I don't write back.

02:55.997 --> 02:57.431
What am I afraid of?

02:57.499 --> 02:58.766
I said take that off!

02:58.834 --> 03:00.801
Fine! You don't believe me?
I'll prove it to you.

03:00.869 --> 03:03.104
You know how I go out
of town once a year?

03:03.171 --> 03:05.072
No. I don't like to think about you;
it's confusing.

03:05.140 --> 03:06.707
That's when the team gets
together to reminisce.

03:06.775 --> 03:08.342
Our next gathering
is in a few weeks.

03:08.410 --> 03:10.577
Why don't you come with
me and see for yourself?

03:10.645 --> 03:13.313
Fine! I'll go, and I'll
call you on your nonsense!

03:13.381 --> 03:15.816
Good. I normally take my
barber as my plus one,

03:15.884 --> 03:18.685
but lately, Phil's been
on this corduroy kick.

03:18.753 --> 03:21.087
I-I mean... wh-what do you do?

03:21.155 --> 03:23.256
Wh-What's... what's to be done?

03:26.060 --> 03:28.461
* She say I'm Mr. Ro... *

03:28.529 --> 03:29.529
* Mantic... *

03:29.596 --> 03:30.730
Hey, Francine!

03:30.798 --> 03:32.465
Give Reggie some sugar.

03:32.533 --> 03:34.367
Hey, Reginald!

03:34.434 --> 03:35.968
What are you doing here?

03:36.036 --> 03:38.271
Oh, I got back from a
CIA mission last night.

03:38.339 --> 03:40.740
Stan said I could pop in
and make myself at home.

03:40.808 --> 03:43.209
You know, use y'all's laundry,
shower, maybe spark up a...

03:44.411 --> 03:46.546
I'm sorry, I don't...

03:46.614 --> 03:48.482
Oh, I thought you partook.

03:48.550 --> 03:50.651
ever mind. Boop! Press delete.

03:50.719 --> 03:53.554
Anyway, these
mother-zeroes at the CIA

03:53.622 --> 03:55.557
<i>got me running around.</i>

03:55.625 --> 03:57.226
I just got back from Tangiers.

03:57.293 --> 03:58.994
That is some country-ass country!

03:59.061 --> 04:01.296
You know what they
never heard of there?

04:01.364 --> 04:02.798
Hi-damn-C.

04:02.866 --> 04:05.167
Got some yak juice
squirting out of some goat.

04:05.235 --> 04:07.036
Tastes like butt
coming out some teat.

04:07.104 --> 04:09.506
"You want some figs?
You want some cheese?"

04:09.574 --> 04:11.174
Hell, no! It's 150 degrees!

04:11.242 --> 04:13.143
Can I get a damn ice cube?

04:13.211 --> 04:14.044
Um...

04:17.849 --> 04:20.817
<i>FRANCINE'S VOICE: Dear Reginald,
I didn't want to interrupt you,</i>

04:20.886 --> 04:23.020
<i>but I really had to go
to the bathroom.</i>

04:23.088 --> 04:24.255
<i>Love, Francine.</i>

04:24.323 --> 04:26.190
Did you put my dress in the dryer?

04:26.258 --> 04:28.059
Oh, yeah, I did. It was no problem.

04:28.126 --> 04:29.894
I just threw it in with my jeans.

04:29.962 --> 04:31.061
You shrunk it!

04:31.129 --> 04:32.496
I was gonna wear it tonight!

04:32.564 --> 04:34.498
I'm going to dinner
with my boyfriend Ian.

04:34.566 --> 04:36.466
Ian is gonna like
that tight on you.

04:36.534 --> 04:37.901
Showcase your bits!

04:37.969 --> 04:40.503
Just stay away from me!

04:40.571 --> 04:42.238
Whew, she hate me,

04:42.306 --> 04:44.940
Like the deserts hate the rain.

04:46.176 --> 04:49.178
How much did that fake
sign set you back?

04:52.282 --> 04:54.449
Not bad for La Quinta.

04:54.517 --> 04:57.453
A sign-in table- nice touch, Roger.

04:57.521 --> 04:58.654
Hello, Chex.

04:58.721 --> 05:00.923
I see you didn't bring
your barber this time.

05:00.991 --> 05:03.626
I guess you'll never ask
me to be your plus one!

05:06.130 --> 05:08.465
You're fat, Helen!

05:10.201 --> 05:12.403
Chex!

05:12.471 --> 05:14.939
Who wants their neck sliced open?!

05:17.576 --> 05:19.844
That's... Jim Craig.

05:19.911 --> 05:21.211
And Mark Johnson.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.646
There's Mike Eruzione!

05:22.713 --> 05:24.347
Just in time, Chex.

05:24.415 --> 05:26.750
They're about to show some
of our old game footage.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:50.207 --> 05:52.075
All right!

05:52.143 --> 05:54.211
I can't believe it.

05:54.279 --> 05:57.515
Roger is my hero.

05:57.582 --> 05:58.816
Aah!

05:58.884 --> 06:01.152
Stan, who the hell
are you talking to?

06:01.220 --> 06:03.488
Are you just sitting in
the dark watching me?

06:03.556 --> 06:06.091
Oh, God, were you yanking
it over my sleeping form?

06:06.159 --> 06:07.392
Oh, you sick...

06:07.460 --> 06:08.761
What the...?

06:14.067 --> 06:16.836
You always get what you want,
don't you, Helen?

06:16.904 --> 06:18.204
Bravo.

06:21.961 --> 06:23.861
Little more cereal?
Top off your java?

06:23.929 --> 06:26.197
Oh, looks like that article
continues on page ten.

06:26.265 --> 06:28.199
Dad, he's still the same Roger!

06:28.266 --> 06:31.702
Just because he won a hockey game 30
years ago, he's suddenly your hero?

06:31.770 --> 06:34.138
Yes, Steve. What did your
hero Legoman ever win?

06:34.206 --> 06:35.840
<i>It's Legolas.</i>

06:35.908 --> 06:38.109
You mispronounce it
just to aggravate me.

06:38.177 --> 06:40.812
Ooh... I am steaming, boy!

06:40.880 --> 06:43.248
Ooh...

06:44.851 --> 06:46.285
<i>Roger, I am so sorry</i>

06:46.353 --> 06:48.354
for how I treated
you all these years.

06:48.422 --> 06:49.522
Stan, don't worry about it.

06:49.590 --> 06:51.458
I want you to punch me in the face.

06:51.525 --> 06:53.427
I'm not gonna punch
you in the face.

06:53.495 --> 06:56.029
I want you to hurt me to make
up for how I treated you.

06:56.097 --> 06:58.298
Here, take my gun and shoot
me through the cheek.

06:58.366 --> 06:59.566
Stan, I am not going...

07:00.767 --> 07:02.535
Sorry again about the
whole cheek thing.

07:02.602 --> 07:04.303
I didn't mean to... Nonsense!

07:04.371 --> 07:07.572
You just gave me another hole
for your glory to shine through.

07:07.640 --> 07:09.607
A glory hole in my face.

07:13.879 --> 07:16.046
You're so great.

07:17.716 --> 07:19.150
May I?

07:21.788 --> 07:23.889
Hayley Mills!

07:23.957 --> 07:25.824
America's original sweetheart.

07:25.892 --> 07:27.293
Come on.

07:27.361 --> 07:28.561
It's been a whole week.

07:28.629 --> 07:30.530
You still mad at Reggie?

07:30.598 --> 07:32.499
Look, how about a peace offering?

07:32.566 --> 07:33.700
You like music?

07:33.768 --> 07:35.101
You like Shaggy?

07:35.169 --> 07:36.135
Shaggy!

07:36.203 --> 07:37.103
No.

07:37.171 --> 07:38.137
Yes, you do.

07:38.205 --> 07:39.639
Everybody likes Shaggy.

07:39.707 --> 07:41.173
That's why he playing
the fairgrounds.

07:41.241 --> 07:43.042
Me and you are going.

07:43.110 --> 07:44.209
You don't seem to get it.

07:44.277 --> 07:45.210
I don't like you.

07:45.278 --> 07:46.578
I want to change that.

07:46.645 --> 07:48.279
I want to be your friend.

07:48.347 --> 07:50.347
That's why I'm taking
you to Shaggy, Hayley.

07:50.415 --> 07:51.949
Hayley!

07:53.751 --> 07:55.885
So, Mike Eruzione and I decided

07:55.953 --> 07:57.888
to pull a prank on our
teammates. Uh-huh.

07:57.955 --> 07:59.957
The night before the
game with Czechoslovakia,

08:00.025 --> 08:02.293
we sneak into the locker
room and rub muscle ointment

08:02.360 --> 08:03.561
inside all the helmets, right?

08:03.628 --> 08:04.995
Uh-huh.

08:05.063 --> 08:06.630
So, the next day, on the ice,

08:06.698 --> 08:08.566
the guys started sweating,
and their scalps

08:08.634 --> 08:10.401
started to burn. Oh, man!

08:10.469 --> 08:11.769
But the best part was,

08:11.837 --> 08:14.237
Eruzione and I forgot
which helmets were ours

08:14.305 --> 08:16.173
and put on the ointment
ones by accident.

08:16.240 --> 08:18.842
So, he's going crazy,
with his head all burning up.

08:20.578 --> 08:22.445
And, of course,
I couldn't feel a thing

08:22.513 --> 08:24.714
'cause of all the steroids
I was on. Steroids?

08:28.118 --> 08:29.953
Rob McClanahan, the U.
S. hockey team

08:30.020 --> 08:31.921
is on a roll no one expected.

08:31.989 --> 08:33.690
How are you playing so well?

08:33.758 --> 08:35.424
Well, you know,
we're all about the team.

08:35.491 --> 08:36.792
We focus on fundamentals

08:36.860 --> 08:38.461
and listen to what Coach tells us.

08:38.529 --> 08:39.996
I'll kill your mother!

08:47.239 --> 08:48.907
The team was on steroids?

08:48.974 --> 08:50.308
Not the team; just me.

08:50.376 --> 08:52.444
Yeah, I couldn't get on the ice

08:52.511 --> 08:54.479
without my old Uncle Roy... d.

08:54.547 --> 08:55.914
I don't believe this.

08:55.982 --> 08:58.016
Believe it. That's why
my penis is so small.

08:58.083 --> 08:59.951
But you know what? Worth it.

09:00.019 --> 09:01.620
This is the only thing I need

09:01.687 --> 09:04.088
to dangle to get the ladies.

09:07.826 --> 09:09.594
You cheated.

09:09.662 --> 09:11.029
Yes, of course, I cheated.

09:11.096 --> 09:12.397
It's what I do best.

09:12.465 --> 09:13.631
That and this.

09:13.699 --> 09:14.966
* Doo doo doo doo doo *

09:15.034 --> 09:15.967
* Byoo-byool *

09:16.035 --> 09:17.135
* Doo doo doo doo doo *

09:17.203 --> 09:18.003
* Byoo-byool *

09:24.009 --> 09:25.610
Thought I heard you in here.

09:25.678 --> 09:28.413
Having a good old-fashioned
night cry, huh?

09:28.480 --> 09:30.381
You want Mr. Cry-ceratops?

09:30.449 --> 09:31.683
That's right.

09:31.750 --> 09:33.551
Feed him your tears.

09:33.619 --> 09:34.920
Yes.

09:34.987 --> 09:36.288
You're good with him.

09:36.355 --> 09:38.890
Roger was on steroids
the whole time.

09:38.958 --> 09:41.192
The team never should
have won that gold medal.

09:41.260 --> 09:42.861
I don't know what to do.

09:42.928 --> 09:44.596
Do I tell people the truth?

09:44.664 --> 09:46.532
That one of the greatest moments

09:46.599 --> 09:49.468
in American history has been a lie?

09:52.138 --> 09:53.438
That's it.

09:53.506 --> 09:56.541
I have to go ask the one
true hero I have left

09:56.609 --> 09:57.942
what he thinks I should do.

09:58.010 --> 09:59.411
Ronald Reagan.

09:59.478 --> 10:00.912
But he's dead.

10:00.980 --> 10:03.148
Dead, but not unreachable.

10:03.215 --> 10:04.716
Like Gandalf the Grey

10:04.784 --> 10:06.918
when he came back as
Gandalf the White!

10:06.986 --> 10:08.786
Oh, son.

10:08.854 --> 10:11.289
Every day with you is
a punch in the nads.

10:14.092 --> 10:15.993
And that's my situation,
Mrs. Reagan.

10:16.061 --> 10:18.296
So, I need to know:
What would Ronnie do?

10:18.364 --> 10:21.099
Well, let's ask him.

10:25.072 --> 10:27.808
"Medal... back."

10:27.875 --> 10:29.810
Reagan wants me to
give the medal back.

10:29.878 --> 10:31.579
Come on, son!

10:34.883 --> 10:38.185
When will these
idiots leave me alone?

10:38.253 --> 10:39.887
People coming here
all hours of the day

10:39.955 --> 10:41.989
wanting to talk to Ronnie.

10:42.057 --> 10:43.591
Why do you keep lying to them?

10:43.659 --> 10:45.893
You don't get paid to
ask questions, Paul.

10:45.960 --> 10:48.029
You're a secret service man.

10:48.096 --> 10:51.098
Now, service me.

10:56.605 --> 10:57.872
Just spoke to the pilot.

10:57.940 --> 10:59.274
We should be landing

10:59.341 --> 11:00.775
at the International Olympic
Committee Headquarters

11:00.843 --> 11:02.544
in Switzerland in a half hour.

11:02.612 --> 11:05.114
So, Roger, you're okay with
giving your medal back?

11:05.182 --> 11:06.515
Look, when Stan first told me,

11:06.583 --> 11:08.150
sure, I might've been a tad upset.

11:08.218 --> 11:10.019
But then I decided if the good name

11:10.087 --> 11:12.055
of Chex LeMeneux is
gonna be tarnished,

11:12.122 --> 11:14.891
then let it be Chex
LeMeneux who tarnishes it.

11:14.959 --> 11:19.729
Stan, if you would,
just let me hold her one last time.

11:19.797 --> 11:21.564
Good-bye, old friend.

11:21.631 --> 11:23.466
I never thought it
would end like this.

11:23.533 --> 11:25.602
I always thought I'd end
up selling you for meth.

11:25.669 --> 11:28.204
But there's nothing
noble about this.

11:28.271 --> 11:31.507
Excuse me, I need to use the
restroom before we land.

11:31.575 --> 11:34.277
Uh, uh, I don't want you
to take the medal in there.

11:34.344 --> 11:35.745
I know you don't wash your hands.

11:35.813 --> 11:38.014
You don't have to
every single time.

11:38.082 --> 11:39.449
The only time my hands
get dirty is when I drop

11:39.517 --> 11:41.818
my sandwich in the toilet bowl.

11:45.257 --> 11:47.025
I'm surprised at Roger's attitude.

11:47.092 --> 11:48.426
I was, too.

11:48.494 --> 11:50.895
I think he genuinely feels
bad about this whole thing.

11:50.963 --> 11:53.231
He can't ever totally
make up for what he did,

11:53.299 --> 11:55.233
but it seems like he wants to try.

11:55.301 --> 11:57.535
He finally seems to understand

11:57.603 --> 11:59.770
the difference between
right and wrong.

12:10.225 --> 12:11.291
Roger?

12:11.359 --> 12:12.859
Roger, where are you?!

12:17.197 --> 12:20.333
We have to push on if we're
gonna make it to the I.O.C.

12:20.401 --> 12:21.667
Reagan wants me to
return the medal,

12:21.735 --> 12:22.969
and that's what we're going to do.

12:23.036 --> 12:24.169
But Roger?

12:24.237 --> 12:25.671
If he survived,
he'll meet us there.

12:25.739 --> 12:30.810
If he didn't, he'd still
want us to make things right.

12:30.877 --> 12:34.213
Shouldn't we spend at least
two minutes looking for him?

12:38.519 --> 12:42.289
The Smitheses takes
the precious from us.

12:42.357 --> 12:44.191
Precious is ourses.

12:46.128 --> 12:50.131
Oh, what a beautiful ringses.

12:50.198 --> 12:52.366
Wait, this turns people invisible?

12:52.434 --> 12:54.736
Who needs to be invisible
in the middle of nowhere?

12:54.803 --> 12:57.438
Where were you when I
farted at Danny's wedding?

13:04.046 --> 13:05.413
You having a good time?

13:05.481 --> 13:07.615
You enjoy that funnel
cake I got you?

13:07.683 --> 13:09.918
So, I'm trying to give up soda.

13:09.985 --> 13:12.953
It is hard, my Lord, it is hard!

13:13.021 --> 13:16.523
Listen, thanks for this,
but I'm pretty tired, I'm gonna go.

13:16.591 --> 13:18.291
Hey!

13:18.359 --> 13:21.360
Yo, man, apologize to the lady!

13:21.428 --> 13:23.196
Reginald, it's okay,
just let it go.

13:23.263 --> 13:26.466
Check your skank,
you tiny marsupial!

13:28.869 --> 13:30.437
Hold my chain.

13:33.141 --> 13:34.341
Yeah!

13:34.409 --> 13:36.944
Ooh, have some!

13:39.715 --> 13:42.050
Say you're sorry to the lady.

13:42.118 --> 13:43.452
I'm sorry.

13:43.519 --> 13:45.187
Say it so all these nice
people can hear you.

13:45.254 --> 13:47.622
I'm sorry!

13:47.690 --> 13:48.990
Whoo! All right!

13:49.057 --> 13:51.325
Wow, no one's ever stood
up for me like that before.

13:51.393 --> 13:52.493
No?

13:52.561 --> 13:53.894
Well, it's not easy to beat down

13:53.962 --> 13:55.663
a fool and still look...

13:55.731 --> 13:57.765
<i>* Cute as a button. *</i>

14:04.039 --> 14:07.376
Master wants to take
the Precious from us.

14:07.443 --> 14:08.744
You mean the medal?

14:08.811 --> 14:11.880
He plans to destroy our precious!

14:11.948 --> 14:13.982
Okay, first of all,
say it, don't spray it.

14:14.050 --> 14:15.450
Second, I agree with you.

14:15.518 --> 14:19.088
We must kills Master and
gets the precious back.

14:19.155 --> 14:21.957
Wow, look at you! You are brassy.

14:22.025 --> 14:25.527
We leads them through the
tunnel to the jugenherberger.

14:25.594 --> 14:27.529
She likes to drink the nectar.

14:27.597 --> 14:30.798
When they go in,
they won't comes back out!

14:33.335 --> 14:34.468
Roger, you're alive!

14:34.536 --> 14:35.937
What happened to your hair?

14:36.004 --> 14:38.172
What? Nothing.
It burned off in the crash.

14:38.239 --> 14:39.773
I like it. Do you like it?

14:39.841 --> 14:41.842
No. It looks really bad.

14:41.909 --> 14:43.243
Well, you.

14:43.311 --> 14:45.312
Hey, how crazy was
that plane crash, huh?

14:45.380 --> 14:46.947
Luckily no one died but the pilot.

14:47.015 --> 14:48.315
What happened to you?

14:48.383 --> 14:50.885
Well, landed in a tree,
was impaled on a branch,

14:50.953 --> 14:52.153
pulled it out, turned it
into my walking stick.

14:52.221 --> 14:53.555
Very proud of that.

14:53.622 --> 14:55.791
Lost it-- devastated.
And here we are.

14:55.858 --> 14:59.328
Luckily, I know this mountain
from all my I.O.C. ski trips.

14:59.396 --> 15:01.597
In fact, I know a
shortcut to the top.

15:01.665 --> 15:03.132
Fantastic! That's great, Roger!

15:03.200 --> 15:06.535
They goes up, but they
won't comes back down.

15:06.603 --> 15:08.137
What did you say?

15:08.204 --> 15:10.372
I asked if you wanted
to buy some weed.

15:10.440 --> 15:12.975
I said it in a weird voice
so your dad wouldn't hear.

15:13.042 --> 15:14.309
But now he did.

15:14.376 --> 15:16.144
So, you blew the deal.

15:16.211 --> 15:20.114
It was good weed, Steveses.

15:26.287 --> 15:29.356
It's just through here!

15:29.423 --> 15:30.957
Roger?

15:33.894 --> 15:35.795
Something's not right.

15:35.863 --> 15:37.897
Shh, listen!

15:39.934 --> 15:42.869
It's coming from up there.

15:42.937 --> 15:45.873
He'll never escape her clutches.

15:49.110 --> 15:51.378
Where are we?

15:51.446 --> 15:53.614
The youth hostel, silly!

15:56.317 --> 15:57.818
Yes, we are dancing!

15:57.886 --> 16:00.120
Wonderful!

16:01.322 --> 16:02.589
I am Olga.

16:02.657 --> 16:04.958
Welcome to my jugenherberger.

16:05.026 --> 16:06.960
I will make you drink so much,

16:07.028 --> 16:09.429
you will never want
to leave this place.

16:09.497 --> 16:10.797
No, no, I need my wits.

16:15.003 --> 16:17.838
And now,
Hachenscherflaggenschlager.

16:20.008 --> 16:23.410
The precious is mine, mine!

16:25.780 --> 16:28.448
He... betrayed me.

16:28.516 --> 16:30.017
It's over.

16:30.084 --> 16:31.584
He's won.

16:35.489 --> 16:38.725
Circa 1980 Ronald Reagan!

16:38.792 --> 16:40.126
Don't give up, Stan.

16:40.194 --> 16:42.361
You must take the
medal to the I.O.C.

16:42.429 --> 16:45.197
and destroy it by throwing
it into the Olympic torch.

16:45.265 --> 16:47.266
I won't let you down.

16:47.334 --> 16:49.802
Wow, look at me,
talking to my hero.

16:49.869 --> 16:51.904
This could not possibly
get any better.

16:51.972 --> 16:53.405
Oh, no?

16:53.472 --> 16:56.074
How about sharing a Nathan's
hot dog with the Gipper?

16:59.278 --> 17:01.012
When I wake up,
there'd better not be

17:01.080 --> 17:02.847
a weiner slapping me in the face.

17:05.351 --> 17:06.751
Get up!

17:06.819 --> 17:09.887
The time for beer bongs is now!

17:14.761 --> 17:16.695
You lying, thieving, cheater!

17:16.762 --> 17:18.130
You're going to get
what you deserve!

17:18.198 --> 17:20.133
Where do they keep the
British tourist girls?

17:23.738 --> 17:25.839
Look, girls, a present!

17:31.179 --> 17:33.080
No!

17:33.147 --> 17:35.883
They're so horny-y-y-y!

17:41.423 --> 17:43.190
So, we're at the restaurant,

17:43.258 --> 17:44.992
and Ian plucks a
hair out of my head

17:45.060 --> 17:47.395
and puts it in the spaghetti
to try to get us a free meal.

17:47.463 --> 17:48.663
You know what the problem is?

17:48.731 --> 17:50.065
You dating a boy.

17:50.132 --> 17:54.136
What you need to be doing
is dating a grown-ass man.

17:54.204 --> 17:56.939
Well, it's late.
I better head home.

17:57.007 --> 17:58.141
Good night, Hayley.

17:58.208 --> 17:59.342
Good night, Reggie.

17:59.410 --> 18:01.611
I had a great time tonight.

18:03.180 --> 18:05.314
Whoa, girl,
that's the cognac talking.

18:05.382 --> 18:06.982
I'm all up in your head right now.

18:07.050 --> 18:08.451
You're a little bit excited,

18:08.518 --> 18:09.985
you saw Reggie get a
little loose today.

18:10.053 --> 18:11.286
I know what I'm doing.

18:11.354 --> 18:12.721
Hayley, I'm seeing someone.

18:12.789 --> 18:14.723
Oh, you-you never mentioned that.

18:14.791 --> 18:16.058
I didn't think it was relevant.

18:16.125 --> 18:17.692
We were hanging out as friends.

18:17.760 --> 18:20.028
Look, do I know if it's going
to work out with my lady friend?

18:20.095 --> 18:21.362
No, I don't.

18:21.429 --> 18:23.330
But I have to respect Rhonda.

18:23.398 --> 18:25.132
If I didn't, I'd be just like

18:25.200 --> 18:27.368
those boys you run around
with down at the school yard.

18:27.435 --> 18:29.404
Wow, that's really honorable.

18:29.471 --> 18:32.074
She's a lucky lady.

18:32.141 --> 18:33.942
But I want you to know two things.

18:34.010 --> 18:36.445
I sleep with my door unlocked,
and this just happened.

18:41.586 --> 18:44.220
Whoo! She got the
drop on old Reggie.

18:44.288 --> 18:46.222
Caught those full in the face.

18:46.290 --> 18:48.424
Those were guns, Reggie be dead.

18:55.231 --> 18:56.798
There it is!

19:07.776 --> 19:09.043
No!

19:09.111 --> 19:10.611
Precious is mine!

19:31.002 --> 19:32.869
Yeah, so, that's not real fire.

19:32.937 --> 19:35.605
It's a fan blowing
luminescent plastic strips.

19:35.672 --> 19:36.973
Hey, what you guys doing?

19:38.909 --> 19:41.210
Sir, brace yourself.

19:41.277 --> 19:43.778
I have some sad and
shocking information

19:43.846 --> 19:46.047
about the 1980 men's U.
S. Hockey Team.

19:46.115 --> 19:51.385
I have discovered that one of
the players was on steroids.

19:51.453 --> 19:54.221
Which is why I've brought
this back to you.

19:54.289 --> 19:56.791
We didn't earn it and
we don't deserve it.

19:56.858 --> 19:58.326
Yeah, I'm not taking that.

19:58.393 --> 20:00.061
What? Huh? Yay!

20:00.129 --> 20:02.130
Listen, man,
we're the Winter Olympics.

20:02.198 --> 20:03.932
No one gives a crap about us.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.334
The Miracle on Ice franchise

20:05.402 --> 20:06.836
keeps the lights on in this place.

20:06.903 --> 20:10.673
But Ronald Reagan himself told
me to come here and return this.

20:10.741 --> 20:12.709
Oh, Reagan knew about the steroids.

20:12.777 --> 20:14.478
He did? Oh, yeah.

20:14.546 --> 20:17.715
But he also knew how huge
that victory was for the U.S.,

20:17.783 --> 20:20.952
so he "persuaded" us
to look the other way.

20:21.019 --> 20:23.954
That's why we have the Ron
Reagan Memorial Hot Tub.

20:24.022 --> 20:27.825
Get your asses in
this tub right now!

20:35.499 --> 20:37.234
I can't believe it.

20:37.301 --> 20:40.070
Both my heroes betrayed me.

20:40.137 --> 20:42.405
Oh, Dad, Reagan and the hockey team

20:42.473 --> 20:44.474
made mistakes just like we all do.

20:44.542 --> 20:46.877
But the good they did
still inspired you

20:46.945 --> 20:48.646
to become who you are today.

20:48.714 --> 20:50.014
It's okay to have heroes.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.450
Just don't follow and
worship them blindly.

20:52.518 --> 20:56.054
Yeah, I suppose heroes are
just normal people who...
