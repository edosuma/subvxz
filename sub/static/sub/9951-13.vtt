00:02.503 --> 00:03.868
- FBI! Who are you?
- Haven PD.

00:04.004 --> 00:05.869
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.041
- What am I gonna do,
pull out another gun?

00:07.174 --> 00:09.210
People do things in Haven.
- What things?

00:09.343 --> 00:12.255
- A woman whose moods
affected the weather.

00:12.387 --> 00:14.594
Another man's shadow
kills people.

00:14.723 --> 00:18.261
- Haven is chock-full
of the ungodly!

00:18.393 --> 00:20.133
- How do you die?
- Some guy with a tattoo

00:20.270 --> 00:21.601
of a maze
with four little people

00:21.730 --> 00:23.311
at each of the compass points.

00:23.440 --> 00:24.395
- I couldn't feel anything.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.390
I thought I was sick.

00:26.527 --> 00:27.983
Audrey, I can feel
her touch.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.897
- There's gonna come a day
when you're gonna wish

00:30.030 --> 00:31.645
you'd just taken the chance
just to make nice

00:31.782 --> 00:33.067
with your old man.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.690
- You want me to let
bygones be bygones?

00:34.826 --> 00:36.157
- We're never gonna get along,
are we?

00:36.286 --> 00:37.321
- So the crack on the boat?

00:37.454 --> 00:38.739
- We need to get this place
under control.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.408
- You haven't changed, Lucy.

00:40.541 --> 00:41.576
- Lucy was my mother.

00:41.708 --> 00:42.743
- When I had my seizure,

00:42.876 --> 00:43.911
I shattered a glass.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.251
It cut her
deep on the sole of her foot.

01:32.884 --> 01:36.627

01:36.763 --> 01:38.628
I was.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.757
Somehow I was here.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.641
Is there anything else
you want to send my way?

01:46.773 --> 01:49.059
I mean, anything?
Anything at all?

01:49.192 --> 01:51.774
'Cause I got to believe
you have nothing left.

01:51.903 --> 01:53.939
- Whatever it is,
you'll handle it.

01:55.824 --> 01:58.156
- I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

01:58.285 --> 02:00.651
- Whatever you're dealing with,
you'll figure it out.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.368
I've been
in some rough places,

02:02.497 --> 02:04.237
had a few conversations
with myself.

02:04.374 --> 02:07.958
Eventually I got
where I needed to be.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.870
- And where was that?

02:11.006 --> 02:12.712
- Where I'm standing.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.797
It's always
where I'm standing.

02:14.926 --> 02:17.133
- Does this place
mean something to you?

02:18.680 --> 02:21.057
- You know, sometimes, uh...

02:21.183 --> 02:23.515
you leave a mark
where you've been.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.431
Sometimes the tide
just washes it away.

02:26.563 --> 02:29.600
But you don't know
until you come back, do you?

02:29.733 --> 02:31.564
- So you from around here?

02:31.693 --> 02:33.194
- Yeah...

02:33.320 --> 02:35.151
once upon a time.

02:37.032 --> 02:38.613
Good luck.

[bell rings]

02:54.383 --> 02:56.374
- How can I help you?

02:56.510 --> 02:57.716
- Hello, Dave.

02:57.844 --> 03:00.221
It's been a while.
You miss me?

03:00.347 --> 03:02.804
I missed you.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.013
- How you been, Max?

03:04.142 --> 03:05.928
- Well, I've been pacing
an 8x10-foot cell

03:06.061 --> 03:07.722
for close on 10,000 days.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.230
I haven't eaten
a meal off a plate,

03:09.356 --> 03:12.519
taken a hot shower,
or run a mile since '85.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.317
And you?

03:16.446 --> 03:19.483
- Oh, you know,
still running the paper—

03:19.616 --> 03:21.698
posting ads
for, uh, old dogs

03:21.827 --> 03:24.239
and, uh, lost furniture.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.407
- You're still singing
that same old song, huh?

03:26.540 --> 03:28.451
- What do you want, Max?

03:28.583 --> 03:29.743
Money?

03:32.170 --> 03:35.082
- No, what I want now
is a job.

03:35.215 --> 03:38.548
- Well, I'm not sure
I have anything.

03:38.677 --> 03:40.759
Pretty much just, uh, Vince
and me these days—

03:40.887 --> 03:43.754
newspaper business,
you know.

03:43.890 --> 03:46.973
- I'd like to start in, say,
uh, a week or two.

03:47.102 --> 03:50.515
l have a few things
I need to wrap up first.

03:56.528 --> 03:58.689
I'll be in touch.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.161
- You want anything else?

04:05.287 --> 04:06.493
- No, lthink, uh—

04:06.621 --> 04:08.486
I think I've had about enough,
thank you.

04:08.623 --> 04:09.908
I couldn't eat
another bite.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.003
- You all right, Chief?

04:18.133 --> 04:19.748
- Yeah, everything's fine.
Thank you.

04:21.803 --> 04:24.840
- Like to see a menu?

04:24.973 --> 04:28.465
- I'll have what he had—
two of them.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.058
How you been, Garland?

04:30.187 --> 04:31.802
- I didn't hear
you were out.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.849
- You wouldn't have thought
they would've let me out

04:33.982 --> 04:35.438
after your testimony.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.317
- You go ahead
and eat your dinner

04:39.446 --> 04:40.356
and drink your drink,

04:40.489 --> 04:41.695
and then I want you
out of here.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.905
I want you gone from Haven.

04:44.034 --> 04:45.990
I want you gone
from the entire state of Maine.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.280
Do you understand me?
- Can't do that.

04:48.413 --> 04:50.995
I have a few things I need
to take care of right here.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.830
- Either you're gone
by tonight,

04:52.959 --> 04:54.995
or I'll have
your parole violated,

04:55.128 --> 04:57.244
and you'll be back
in Shawshank tomorrow.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.540
It's your choice.

Chief Wuornos.

05:03.512 --> 05:04.843
- What?

05:04.971 --> 05:06.836
- You either kill me now

05:06.973 --> 05:10.511
or get the hell away
from my table.

05:17.025 --> 05:18.936
- You heard what I said.

05:30.080 --> 05:33.447

[dramatic music]

05:44.678 --> 05:52.676

06:12.539 --> 06:14.154
- We know why
the lighthouse fell.

06:14.291 --> 06:15.497
It was a crack,
like the cracks

06:15.625 --> 06:16.740
that have been
plaguing Haven

06:16.877 --> 06:17.957
since the day
I arrived.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.418
- Okay, so we have a crack
here in the road,

06:20.547 --> 06:21.582
a crack on Duke's boat,

06:21.715 --> 06:24.081
crack at the hotel
on Carpenter's Knot.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.924
What do you think, Parker?

06:27.053 --> 06:29.260
Hello?
Anybody home?

06:29.389 --> 06:31.254
- I'm sorry.
What?

06:31.391 --> 06:32.597
- What's going on with you?

06:32.726 --> 06:34.091
- No, nothing, I'm fine.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.603
- No, you're not.
What's going on?

06:35.729 --> 06:38.141
- I haven't been sleeping.

06:38.273 --> 06:41.265
- Oh.
That's too bad.

06:46.615 --> 06:49.106
You should go home.
- Excuse me?

06:49.242 --> 06:50.448
- You don't want to talk
about it.

06:50.577 --> 06:51.441
I get that—go.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.114
I can handle stuff here
for a while.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.111
- No, that—that
doesn't work for me, okay?

06:55.248 --> 06:57.239
Work works for me,
so I'm working.

06:59.586 --> 07:02.123
- You're no good to me
like this.

07:02.255 --> 07:05.463
Go. Sleep.
Think.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.457
Put on some tunes.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.585
- Fine.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.314
- I don't know
who you are, friend,

07:23.443 --> 07:25.809
but you need to get the hell
out of my chair.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.028
- This your boat?

07:28.156 --> 07:29.896
- Damn sure not yours.

07:30.033 --> 07:32.991
- Then you're the man
I came to see.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.700
[chuckles]
Duke Crocker.

07:34.829 --> 07:36.865
- Well, now, you must've missed
the part where I told you

07:36.998 --> 07:38.829
to get your ass
out of my mother-lovin' chair.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.495
- John Draft
up in Shawshank

07:40.627 --> 07:42.913
said you might be the man
to get me a job.

07:43.046 --> 07:44.661
- Well, I'm very sorry,
but I can't help you.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.914
- He also said
you owed him some money.

07:47.050 --> 07:49.132
And that if I wanted
to collect it,

07:49.260 --> 07:50.636
that was fine with him.

07:50.762 --> 07:52.844
- Well, you tell John
if he wants his money,

07:52.973 --> 07:55.464
he's gonna have to come
get it himself.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.472
I know you?

08:02.440 --> 08:05.102
Yeah, I know you.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.726
You got sent up for killing
that family 20 years ago.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.194
- 25.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.161
You don't want
to give me my money,

08:18.289 --> 08:20.154
then I'm gonna have
to take it from you.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.202
- Huh.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.712
Well, you do
what you need to do.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.544
- Oh, that doesn't seem fair
to me.

08:26.673 --> 08:29.005
- Well, I'm not interested
in fair.

08:29.134 --> 08:32.501
I'm interested in getting
your ass off of my boat.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.427
You didn't come here
to fight.

08:42.564 --> 08:44.395
- That's a gamble.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.732
- You just got paroled.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.601
You're gonna risk
getting sent back inside

08:49.738 --> 08:51.103
for John Draft's money?

08:51.239 --> 08:52.604
- He said you were smart.

08:52.741 --> 08:53.981
You're ballsy too.

08:54.117 --> 08:56.073
- Thank you.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.579
Now, why don't you tell me
why you really came here.

08:58.705 --> 09:02.368
- I'll find you
at the Gull.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.912
Great shrimp,
by the way.

09:15.096 --> 09:17.712
- Chief, I need a signature—
- Don't you knock anymore?

09:19.267 --> 09:20.552
- The door was open.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.181
Max Hansen?

09:31.946 --> 09:33.732
He didn't make parole,
did he?

09:33.865 --> 09:35.105
- You don't have to concern
yourself with that.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.617
Just get down there
and check out those cracks

09:36.743 --> 09:38.574
opening up, will you?

09:48.588 --> 09:50.453
[pounding on door]

09:50.590 --> 09:53.753
- Audrey!

09:53.885 --> 09:55.091
Parker!

09:57.722 --> 09:59.053
- Easy now.

09:59.182 --> 10:00.388
I'm not one
of the thousand people

10:00.517 --> 10:01.632
you've pissed off
in your life.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.554
Well, actually, I am,

10:03.686 --> 10:05.642
but I'm not one
of the dangerous ones.

10:05.772 --> 10:06.807
- Great.
Where's Audrey?

10:06.940 --> 10:07.975
- She doesn't want
to talk to anybody.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.473
- Except you.
- Not yet.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.474
She'll talk
when she's ready to talk.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.976
Cupcakes will help.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.819
What do you want
to talk to her about?

10:14.948 --> 10:17.234
- Just tell her
a man with a tattoo

10:17.367 --> 10:18.402
came to see me.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.867
- In your world.
What are the odds?

10:20.995 --> 10:24.362
- Tell her I said,
"It's the tattoo,"

10:24.499 --> 10:26.706
the one that's supposed to be
on the man who kills me.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.541
It's on a man
named Max Hansen,

10:28.670 --> 10:30.410
the man who killed
that family 20 years ago.

10:30.547 --> 10:31.832
Remember?

10:31.965 --> 10:33.876
Did your mother ever mention
anything about this?

10:34.008 --> 10:35.669
Does she know anything
about this? Do you?

10:35.802 --> 10:37.383
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

10:37.512 --> 10:39.048
I don't like
who you've become, Duke.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.262
I thought I made that clear.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.052
Now go away.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.140
I'll tell Audrey
you were here.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.148
- Super helpful.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.605
- Hey.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.117
Did you get the cupcakes?

11:00.243 --> 11:02.029
- A dozen...

11:02.162 --> 11:03.242
half with sprinkles.

11:03.371 --> 11:07.205
- They're Rosemary's.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.539
- Duke was here.

11:08.668 --> 11:09.828
- What did he want?

11:14.966 --> 11:17.173
- Little warm-up
for the road there, hon?

11:21.514 --> 11:24.381
- I know you.
Max Hansen.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.758
- Ch, of course.
It's nice to see you again.

11:26.895 --> 11:28.431
- Heard you visited
a friend of mine.

11:28.563 --> 11:31.100
- I've visited a number
of old friends recently.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.733
- Duke Crocker,
he owns the place.

11:32.859 --> 11:36.818
- Yeah, yeah.
I heard he was impressive.

11:36.946 --> 11:37.810
- Was he?

11:37.947 --> 11:39.903
- That remains to be seen.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.445
I came here hoping
to run into him, actually.

11:42.577 --> 11:44.909
- He said that you had
a tattoo.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.448
- Mm-hmm, several.

11:46.581 --> 11:48.572
- This one was in
the inside of your forearm

11:48.708 --> 11:51.495
in the shape of a maze.

11:51.628 --> 11:52.583
- Would you like something?

11:52.712 --> 11:53.918
I feel a little impolite

11:54.047 --> 11:55.628
eating in front of you
like this.

11:55.757 --> 11:59.215
- You either tell me or don't,
but don't play games.

12:02.847 --> 12:05.259
' [93393] Oh. my God.
I'm so sorry.

12:05.391 --> 12:06.380
Let me get a towel.

12:06.517 --> 12:08.428
- Ah, clumsy me.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.768
Good thing they serve
cold coffee here.

12:10.897 --> 12:14.264
Well, you'll have
to excuse me.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.686
I got to get to church.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.062
- You killed
the Colorado Kid.

12:26.204 --> 12:28.445
- Garland Wuornos thought so.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.742
He never proved it,
though, did he?

12:33.544 --> 12:35.796
See you around.

12:43.346 --> 12:45.211
- What the hell
does this tattoo mean?

12:45.348 --> 12:47.213
Why is this guy
trying to kill me?

12:47.350 --> 12:49.466
- Do you remember anything
from the Colorado Kid?

12:49.602 --> 12:51.888
I mean, anything about
that day that could help me?

12:52.021 --> 12:55.058
- I wish I did,
but I don't.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.978
- I'm sorry, but...

12:58.111 --> 13:00.318
Duke, that guy
who was sitting there,

13:00.446 --> 13:02.061
I spilled coffee
all over him.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.689
- Great. I'm gonna get killed
over spilled coffee.

13:04.826 --> 13:05.861
- The pot was scalding hot.

13:05.994 --> 13:08.531
If he sues us,
am I fired?

13:08.663 --> 13:10.199
- Don't you have customers?

13:11.916 --> 13:13.656
- What?

13:13.793 --> 13:15.249
- What is it?

13:15.378 --> 13:16.538
- The pot—
it was scalding hot,

13:16.671 --> 13:18.411
and he—he didn't feel it.

13:18.548 --> 13:19.583
- I'm sure that it's me.

13:19.716 --> 13:20.922
I'm sure I'm the one
not getting it.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.712
- He didn't feel.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.529
- Can I help you?

13:53.666 --> 13:54.746
[scoffs]

13:54.876 --> 13:57.083
- Nathan Wuornos.

13:57.211 --> 13:58.075
- Who are you?

13:58.212 --> 14:00.203
- Direct, no flinching—

14:00.340 --> 14:01.796
I knew I'd like you.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.175
- I'm flattered.
Who are you?

14:03.301 --> 14:05.883
- I'm an old friend
of the chiefs.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.673
- You're Max Hansen.

14:07.805 --> 14:09.511
- You're smart too.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.426
[chuckles]

14:11.559 --> 14:15.427
Now, ljust came by
to say hello.

14:15.563 --> 14:16.643
That's—that's all.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.354
I don't want
no trouble at all, Nathan.

14:18.483 --> 14:19.689
You tell your father that.

14:19.817 --> 14:23.230
I just want a little house
with a little yard.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.899
- You don't take your hand
off my shoulder,

14:25.031 --> 14:27.238
you're gonna get a ride
back to Shawshank...

14:27.367 --> 14:28.698
or a bullet.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.328
- Damn.

14:34.457 --> 14:36.664
You can't feel that at all,
can you?

14:36.793 --> 14:39.284
- You really don't want
to stay in Haven.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.081
- Oh, but I do.

14:41.214 --> 14:44.081
Oh, l—l—l have friends here,
Nathan.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.333
One thing I learned
in prison—

14:46.469 --> 14:49.836
if a man has the right kind
of friends,

14:49.972 --> 14:53.590
life gets a whole lot easier.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.718
You remember that.

15:04.529 --> 15:05.860
- So tell me, Leo,

15:05.988 --> 15:08.400
Max Hansen—
you know him?

15:08.533 --> 15:10.239
- Spent ten years
in the same cellblock.

15:10.368 --> 15:11.528
Why?

15:11.661 --> 15:13.276
- Do you know anything
about where he got his tattoos?

15:13.413 --> 15:14.698
- No.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.913
But I didn't see him
get any while I was in with him.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.076
- Okay, what else?

15:18.209 --> 15:20.791
What was he like?
What did he do?

15:20.920 --> 15:22.626
- Max did the fights—

15:22.755 --> 15:24.620
best in his class
while I was there.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.793
Nothing anybody could throw
at him would slow him down.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.962
It was like he couldn't feel
the hits, you know?

15:33.599 --> 15:35.635
- Hey, do you know why
he may have come back to Haven?

15:35.768 --> 15:37.008
- He always wanted
to track down

15:37.145 --> 15:39.511
some long-lost family
when he got out.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.279
- Why are you here?

15:54.412 --> 15:55.777
- You know why I'm here.

15:55.913 --> 15:57.414
Your brother owes me.

15:57.540 --> 15:58.746
- Well, so do I.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.831
- Easy, Vince.

16:00.960 --> 16:04.373
- You didn't come back to Haven
to collect from Dave.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.041
Why are you here?

16:06.174 --> 16:09.007
- I'm here to claim the life
that was taken from me,

16:09.135 --> 16:11.717
the family that was stolen
from me,

16:11.846 --> 16:14.679
and to watch the man
that took it all from me die.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.093
- Garland's not alone,
you know.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.182
- Neither am I.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.098
l have friends in Haven.

16:21.230 --> 16:24.313
- I'm sure they won't mind
if you die first.

16:25.735 --> 16:27.896
Leave now, Max...

16:28.029 --> 16:31.863
before I do something
I really enjoy.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.947
- You know, it's good to see
that somebody in this town

16:34.076 --> 16:35.907
remembers who he is.

16:36.037 --> 16:37.823
Tell your brother

16:37.955 --> 16:39.536
I'll be back
for what's mine.

16:39.665 --> 16:42.042
Oh, and, Vince...

16:44.837 --> 16:46.122
I'm gonna kill you.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.587
- Are you sure?

16:48.716 --> 16:51.674
Couldn't get it done
the last time.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.727
- Are you sure you want
to tell Nathan alone?

17:03.856 --> 17:07.724
- No, but he's my partner.

17:07.860 --> 17:10.397
- Did you already tell him
about the other thing?

17:10.530 --> 17:12.737
- What?

17:12.865 --> 17:14.526
- The thing
that's got you holed up

17:14.659 --> 17:17.947
living on frosting.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.569
I didn't think so.

17:19.705 --> 17:23.163
Hey.

17:23.292 --> 17:26.079
Come on.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.294
What is it?
You're a mess.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.259
- I can't.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.341
- 'Cause you have
to tell Nathan first.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.961
- Yeah.

17:37.098 --> 17:40.215
Yeah, pretty much.

17:40.351 --> 17:42.933
- Do I have to like that?

17:44.522 --> 17:48.356
- Today, yeah.

17:54.991 --> 17:57.778
Nathan, we need to talk.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.946
I found out something
about Max Hansen.

18:02.623 --> 18:03.658
- What's up?

18:03.791 --> 18:06.999
- He can't feel anything.

18:07.128 --> 18:08.664
- How do you know this?

18:08.796 --> 18:10.377
- Well, it—
it doesn't matter, all right?

18:10.506 --> 18:11.962
What matters is—
- How do you know?

18:12.091 --> 18:13.297
- It doesn't matter.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.259
You have the same affliction,

18:16.387 --> 18:18.594
which probably means
that you're—

18:18.723 --> 18:20.884
- Related.

18:23.728 --> 18:27.016
Did you forget to tell me
something about Max Hansen?

18:27.148 --> 18:28.638
- What?
- You put him away.

18:28.774 --> 18:29.980
You know everything
about him,

18:30.109 --> 18:31.974
and you tell me,
"Don't concern yourself"?

18:32.111 --> 18:33.817
- Can we get
a minute alone here?

18:33.946 --> 18:35.231
- You can say it
in front of her.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.070
- What, you found out...

18:37.199 --> 18:39.656
that he can't feel anything?

18:39.785 --> 18:41.821
So you know that—

18:41.954 --> 18:44.331
that you're...

18:44.457 --> 18:46.118
related.

18:48.002 --> 18:49.458
I wanted to tell you.

18:49.587 --> 18:50.997
- That I have relatives
in Haven

18:51.130 --> 18:52.995
that I didn't even
know about?

18:57.178 --> 18:58.668
- I'm not...

18:58.804 --> 19:01.841
I'm not your father,

19:01.974 --> 19:03.680
Nathan.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.345
Max Hansen's your father.

19:12.568 --> 19:14.149
Are you gonna say something?

19:14.278 --> 19:15.893
- Can't say I'm surprised.

19:16.030 --> 19:17.019
- You mean you know?

19:17.156 --> 19:19.488
- This? No.

19:19.617 --> 19:22.359
But you—there are so many
things you don't tell me,

19:22.495 --> 19:24.031
secrets you don't trust me with.

19:24.163 --> 19:27.496
Why—why should one more
surprise me?

19:33.130 --> 19:34.381
- I wanted to tell him
for so long.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.247
I just thought, well,
I'll wait a little while,

19:36.384 --> 19:38.420
and hopefully things
will get better between us.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.634
It'll be easier to tell him,

19:40.763 --> 19:41.878
and I won't lose him.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.925
But, no,
things never actually

19:44.058 --> 19:48.893
did get better between us,
and I've lost him anyways.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.558
- Max Hansen
let you adopt his son?

19:51.691 --> 19:54.933
- Well, he was—
he was already inside, anyway.

19:57.405 --> 20:01.523
The way he treated
Nathan's mother,

20:01.659 --> 20:03.695
the way he treated
that little boy,

20:03.828 --> 20:06.490
I should've killed him then.

20:06.622 --> 20:11.707
He does not deserve a place
in Nathan's life.

20:11.836 --> 20:14.794
- I guess Hansen
thought otherwise.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.878
Maybe that's why he came back.

20:17.007 --> 20:18.417
- I don't know
what's in that man's head.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.041
Look, do you mind?

20:35.276 --> 20:37.267
[people screaming]

20:45.786 --> 20:46.866
- Ah!

21:10.060 --> 21:11.800
- Well, I confirmed he's dead,

21:11.937 --> 21:13.052
in case you were wondering.

21:13.189 --> 21:15.680
Ought to make Duke happy.

21:15.816 --> 21:18.398
- Duke...

21:18.527 --> 21:19.687
Let's find him.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.321
Max threatened him, right?

21:21.447 --> 21:22.687
- Whoa, no, no, no, no, no.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.654
Max—Max threatened you too.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.274
- Oh, so you think
I killed him?

21:26.410 --> 21:28.571
- No, I'm not—I'm not saying
that, Nathan, okay?

21:28.704 --> 21:30.285
I'm just saying
that Duke went out of his way

21:30.414 --> 21:31.494
to help me look into Max.

21:31.624 --> 21:32.830
- To protect himself.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.368
- No, to protect you.

21:34.502 --> 21:37.335
He wanted me to be the one
to tell you about your father,

21:37.463 --> 21:39.374
okay?

21:39.507 --> 21:41.714
I don't think that he would do
something like this.

21:41.842 --> 21:43.833
- There were cracks
on Duke's boat.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.675
There were cracks at the hotel
on Carpenter's Knot,

21:45.805 --> 21:46.760
and Duke was there.

21:46.889 --> 21:48.845
I mean, maybe—
maybe he's playing nice,

21:48.974 --> 21:50.805
but he's still a suspect.

21:58.067 --> 22:00.353
- Hey, hey.

22:00.486 --> 22:03.228
- Sorry about that.

22:03.364 --> 22:04.945
- I hear you're afraid
of Max Hansen.

22:05.074 --> 22:07.190
- Ah, screw it.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.692
Normally I'd try
to act all manly,

22:09.829 --> 22:12.946
but, yeah,
I'm terrified.

22:13.082 --> 22:14.618
Why do you ask?

22:14.750 --> 22:17.036
- Make it a lot easier
on you if he was dead,

22:17.169 --> 22:18.033
wouldn't it?

22:18.170 --> 22:20.206
- Are you offering?

22:20.339 --> 22:21.875
- Where were you earlier, Duke?

22:22.007 --> 22:25.044
- Oh, did somebody take care
of my little problem?

22:25.177 --> 22:26.917
- Just answer the question.

22:27.054 --> 22:28.840
- They did?

22:28.973 --> 22:30.804
They—thank you!

22:30.933 --> 22:32.889
Thank you!

22:33.018 --> 22:35.134
That is outstanding.
All right, hmm?

22:35.271 --> 22:36.386
Oh, no, don't worry
about it.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.353
I'm not offended that you asked.
It's fine.

22:38.482 --> 22:40.473
So...

22:40.609 --> 22:41.985
how did he die?

22:42.111 --> 22:45.148
- He was swallowed
by a crack in the ground.

22:45.281 --> 22:48.239
- He was swallowed
by a crack in the ground, yes.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.232
Yes.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.825
Nathan, come on.

22:51.954 --> 22:53.364
I mean, if I could do that,
why am I out here

22:53.497 --> 22:55.078
playing Jed Clampett
with a shotgun in my lap?

22:55.207 --> 22:56.413
- Where were you?

22:56.542 --> 22:58.908
- l was right here.

22:59.044 --> 23:02.252
And with all due respect,
Nathan,

23:02.381 --> 23:04.918
you know I'm not
a troubled person.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.881
- Max Hansen didn't know you.

23:07.011 --> 23:08.672
So why did he come
to see you?

23:08.804 --> 23:10.590
- I have no idea.

23:10.723 --> 23:13.715
- I don't believe you.

23:16.312 --> 23:20.021
- [sighs]

23:20.149 --> 23:21.764
- I don't think
that you killed him.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.107
- Good.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.850
Care to celebrate
my continued existence?

23:24.987 --> 23:25.942
I'm buying.

23:26.071 --> 23:28.107
- You know, just because
this guy's dead

23:28.240 --> 23:29.776
doesn't mean that
another guy with a tattoo

23:29.909 --> 23:31.274
isn't gonna kill you.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.617
- You really are a buzzkill.

23:33.746 --> 23:34.781
Why would you say that?

23:34.914 --> 23:36.074
I liked you so much better

23:36.206 --> 23:38.117
when you were locked up
in your cupcake room.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.490
- I'm just saying
that if I were you,

23:39.627 --> 23:40.992
I would be looking
into the tattoo

23:41.128 --> 23:43.119
and not just worrying
about one guy,

23:43.255 --> 23:45.041
especially a dead one.

23:55.643 --> 23:58.225
[bell rings]

23:58.354 --> 24:00.766
- Uh, Chief, you know
you can't smoke in here.

24:02.816 --> 24:04.226
- It's okay, Vince.

24:07.112 --> 24:09.524
Garland, you all right?

24:09.657 --> 24:11.272
- He found out today.

24:13.953 --> 24:16.740
I knew this day was coming.

24:16.872 --> 24:20.535
And there was really nothing
I could do about it...

24:20.668 --> 24:21.828
Well, nothing right anyway.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.076
- Who found out what?

24:23.212 --> 24:25.999
- Nathan.
He knows about Max.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.333
- Had to happen.

24:30.469 --> 24:31.925
- [sighs]

24:32.054 --> 24:33.385
- I know you two
had your troubles,

24:33.514 --> 24:35.880
but the fact is
you took him in.

24:36.016 --> 24:37.722
You raised him
as best you could,

24:37.851 --> 24:39.387
even after his mum died.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.602
- Not really sure
any of that matters now.

24:41.730 --> 24:43.516
- Oh, it does.
It does.

24:43.649 --> 24:45.389
- Does it?

24:45.526 --> 24:48.063
- I talked to Max today too.

24:48.195 --> 24:51.187
Made a point of saying
he had friends here.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.279
That troubles me.

24:53.409 --> 24:54.990
- He got friends, does he?

24:55.119 --> 24:59.078
Well, I'd like to see
who shows up for that funeral.

24:59.206 --> 25:00.366
You know what it's gonna be.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.205
It's gonna be Nathan
sitting there all alone.

25:02.334 --> 25:05.076
- Nathan won't abandon you,
Garland.

25:05.212 --> 25:06.713
- Just give him time.

25:06.839 --> 25:10.457
- I gave him nothing but.

25:10.592 --> 25:11.581
- Never?

25:11.719 --> 25:13.755
You've never seen it before?
Great.

25:13.887 --> 25:15.388
Well, I'm glad
I didn't spend four years

25:15.514 --> 25:17.846
at your crap university.

25:19.393 --> 25:21.054
- Hi.

25:21.186 --> 25:22.562
- Come to dislike me up close?

25:22.688 --> 25:24.804
- You play
the bad-boy smuggler,

25:24.940 --> 25:27.431
but I think maybe you got
a heart in there.

25:27.568 --> 25:29.274
- And someone is very interested
in removing it,

25:29.403 --> 25:30.734
which has me a little busy.

25:30.863 --> 25:33.024
- Duke, there's something
you should see.

25:37.369 --> 25:39.451
The guy on the right's
my grandfather.

25:39.580 --> 25:40.444
- So?

25:40.581 --> 25:42.037
- Look closely.

25:48.964 --> 25:50.670
- How long have you known
about this?

25:50.799 --> 25:53.051
- Come on.

26:00.309 --> 26:02.015
- This is a long shot.

26:02.144 --> 26:03.850
- Well, he was here
at least once.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.685
- Nathan.

26:05.814 --> 26:07.770
- No, Dave, not now.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.015
- How are you, Nathan?

26:09.151 --> 26:11.688
- Fine.
Also working.

26:11.820 --> 26:13.526
- Listen, I, uh—

26:13.655 --> 26:15.270
I spoke to your father.

26:15.407 --> 26:16.943
- Which one?

26:19.411 --> 26:21.447
So you do know.

26:21.580 --> 26:24.117
Of course, of course
the chief talks to you.

26:24.249 --> 26:25.625
- You both are suffering
right now.

26:25.751 --> 26:26.991
It's understandable.

26:27.127 --> 26:30.164
Look, give it time.

26:30.297 --> 26:31.958
- Excuse me.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.547
You recognize this guy?

26:33.675 --> 26:35.381
- You can't just walk away.

26:35.511 --> 26:37.126
You're gonna have to deal
with this.

26:37.262 --> 26:39.298
- Dave, Dave, listen.
NoW's not the time.

26:39.431 --> 26:40.967
- Look, you're not
the only one hurt here.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.510
- Dave, let's finish lunch.
Come on.

26:42.643 --> 26:43.803
- I've known your father
a long time.

26:43.936 --> 26:45.597
- Leave me the hell alone

26:45.729 --> 26:48.311
so I can do my damn job.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.055
- Go. Come on.

26:50.192 --> 26:51.272
Sorry.

26:56.156 --> 26:57.692
- Have you seen him?

26:57.825 --> 26:59.440
- Twice.

26:59.576 --> 27:00.861
Once with you.

27:00.994 --> 27:02.154
The other time, he was alone.

27:02.287 --> 27:03.493
- And what time was this?

27:03.622 --> 27:05.362
- Not sure,
maybe 2:00 or 3:00.

27:05.499 --> 27:07.660
- That's when
the lighthouse fell.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.329
- Was he with anyone?

27:09.461 --> 27:11.292
- Sat at the table
next to the chief.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.457
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

27:21.306 --> 27:22.682
- Of course.

27:22.808 --> 27:24.389
The chief runs into Max,

27:24.518 --> 27:26.850
he gets upset,
and the lighthouse goes down.

27:26.979 --> 27:29.345
- He got upset when you were
on the boat, and it cracked.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.096
- He was upset at the hotel
when that cracked,

27:31.233 --> 27:32.097
at the Carpenter's Knot.

27:32.234 --> 27:33.849
- I found a chasm
in the ground

27:33.986 --> 27:35.351
near where he goes hunting.

27:35.487 --> 27:36.988
- And he was afraid
when he ran into Hansen

27:37.114 --> 27:39.196
that he would—
that he would tell you

27:39.324 --> 27:41.531
that he was your father.

27:41.660 --> 27:42.740
And when you found out,

27:42.870 --> 27:44.576
Hansen was swallowed up
by a crack,

27:44.705 --> 27:46.286
and then he died.

27:46.415 --> 27:49.122
- It's the chief.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.912
It was always the chief.

28:02.055 --> 28:03.386
Check his calendar.

28:03.515 --> 28:04.721
- Hey, Nathan, we need to talk

28:04.850 --> 28:06.556
about what's gonna happen
when we find him.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.016
- No, we need
to find him first.

28:08.145 --> 28:10.557
- Yeah, we need to find him,
yes, but he is your father.

28:10.689 --> 28:11.895
- That's debatable.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.605
- No, listen,
I know you're angry.

28:13.734 --> 28:15.065
I know that you hate him,

28:15.194 --> 28:16.900
and maybe you don't even
share the same DNA,

28:17.029 --> 28:19.816
but, Nathan, listen to me,
he is your father.

28:21.450 --> 28:22.690
He is a troubled person,

28:22.826 --> 28:24.657
and I don't think
that he killed anyone.

28:24.786 --> 28:25.912
- You can't be sure
about that.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.574
He's been lying to me
since I was a kid.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.571
- You're right,
but you didn't leave Haven.

28:29.708 --> 28:30.914
You could have.

28:31.043 --> 28:32.749
You could have been a cop
anywhere else,

28:32.878 --> 28:34.789
but you—you chose to stay.

28:34.922 --> 28:36.287
- So what?

28:36.423 --> 28:37.879
- So you could work it out
with your father.

28:38.008 --> 28:39.418
But you guys
are both so stubborn,

28:39.551 --> 28:42.133
you haven't sorted it out yet,
but when we find your father—

28:42.262 --> 28:43.763
- The chief, you mean?
- No, your father.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.299
When we find him,
we're gonna ask him

28:45.432 --> 28:47.593
what the hell
has been going on, all right?

28:47.726 --> 28:49.591
Do you understand me?

28:51.647 --> 28:53.683
You know what?
Actually, I don't—

28:53.815 --> 28:55.521
I don't even care.

28:55.651 --> 28:57.562
You guys are just so—
you're so messed up.

28:57.694 --> 29:00.481
Where—where would he go?

29:00.614 --> 29:03.321
All right, you know him
better than anyone else.

29:03.450 --> 29:05.441
Where is he?

29:05.577 --> 29:09.286
- This isn't right.

29:09.414 --> 29:11.530
Do you want to just tell me
where we're going?

29:11.667 --> 29:14.249
- We're almost there.
Be patient.

29:14.378 --> 29:16.289
- Patient?

29:16.421 --> 29:18.286
Why would I be patient?

29:18.423 --> 29:20.129
Somebody out there
with a tattoo

29:20.259 --> 29:21.749
that's in your family
wants to kill me.

29:21.885 --> 29:23.750
So, no.
No, thank you.

29:23.887 --> 29:25.969
I will absolutely
not be patient.

29:26.098 --> 29:29.682
Tell me where we're going.

29:29.810 --> 29:31.220
- Here.

29:36.608 --> 29:38.018
- Is this your grandfather?

29:38.151 --> 29:40.984
- No, he's over there.

29:42.823 --> 29:45.860
I don't know who this is...

29:45.993 --> 29:49.076
or who that is...

29:49.204 --> 29:51.320
or that...

29:51.456 --> 29:54.323
or that...

29:54.459 --> 29:55.790
orthat

30:16.315 --> 30:18.897
- Chief.

30:19.026 --> 30:21.768
- I knew you guys
would find me eventually.

30:21.903 --> 30:24.110
- And why was that?
- 'Cause you're good cops.

30:24.239 --> 30:26.901
It's just a matter of time
before you put it all together

30:27.034 --> 30:29.867
and figured out
my little problem.

30:29.995 --> 30:31.360
- The cracks?

30:31.496 --> 30:34.863
- Not been easy
holding it all together.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.582
I've tried everything.
I tried drinking.

30:37.711 --> 30:39.872
I tried smoking.

30:40.005 --> 30:43.589
Hell, I even tried
going to church.

30:43.717 --> 30:47.380
- But they just got worse.

30:47.512 --> 30:48.888
- Did you kill Max?

30:49.014 --> 30:50.379
- Yeah, I guess I did.

30:50.515 --> 30:51.891
It was accidental,

30:52.017 --> 30:54.554
not that that matters
a whole lot now.

30:54.686 --> 30:57.598
I don't want to say I regret it,
'cause I don't.

30:57.731 --> 30:59.722
Hated that man.
He was pure evil.

30:59.858 --> 31:02.065
But I figured it out now.

31:02.194 --> 31:06.062
There's only one way that
we're gonna make this stop.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.734
- Chief.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.072
- I'm sorry about this, Nathan.

31:09.201 --> 31:10.782
There's just
no simple answers here.

31:10.911 --> 31:13.277
I mean, obviously you just can't
stick me in some lighthouse,

31:13.413 --> 31:15.620
'cause before long, I'm just
gonna destroy everything—

31:15.749 --> 31:17.080
this town,
I'm gonna destroy you,

31:17.209 --> 31:20.246
and that's everything I got
and everything I ever had.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.119
- What are you trying
to hold together?

31:22.255 --> 31:24.507
- Well, Haven, of course...

31:24.633 --> 31:26.419
this town.

31:26.551 --> 31:29.088
This town is standing
on the edge.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.883
And I'm just not sure
I can really stop it anymore.

31:32.015 --> 31:32.925
Agh.

31:33.058 --> 31:34.889
- Whoa.

31:36.728 --> 31:37.934
Come on in, Chief.

31:38.063 --> 31:39.428
We'll figure this out.

31:39.564 --> 31:41.145
Please, just put the gun down.

31:41.274 --> 31:42.480
- It's your town now.

31:42.609 --> 31:46.352
I'm sorry I've been
so hard on you, Nathan.

31:46.488 --> 31:47.944
I had to make you strong.

31:48.073 --> 31:50.689
Well, you are stronger now,

31:50.826 --> 31:53.613
stronger than I am.

31:53.745 --> 31:54.780
I'm done.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.278
I can't be fixed.

31:56.415 --> 31:57.780
- Yes.
Yes, you can.

31:57.916 --> 32:00.999
- You're still not seeing
what's right in front of you.

32:01.128 --> 32:03.119
Audrey sees
what's in front of her.

32:03.255 --> 32:06.497
She's not telling me
it's all gonna be fine, are you?

32:06.633 --> 32:07.918
- Tell him, Audrey.

32:10.303 --> 32:11.918
Go ahead, tell him.

32:14.474 --> 32:16.135
Tell him!

32:16.268 --> 32:19.260
- [groaning]

32:36.788 --> 32:39.325
I've just been holding it
together

32:39.458 --> 32:41.824
for such a long, long time.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.872
I was waiting for you,
Audrey.

32:45.005 --> 32:47.087
Be careful.

32:47.215 --> 32:50.673
Not everyone's
thrilled you're back.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.178
- Please let us help.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.636
- I love you, son.

32:56.892 --> 32:58.632
- Dad.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.419
- Thank you, guys,
for coming.

33:32.552 --> 33:36.010
I didn't know how else
to make this private.

33:36.139 --> 33:37.549
- Of course.

33:37.682 --> 33:40.765
We still can't believe it.
Poor Garland.

33:40.894 --> 33:42.976
- Thanks for calling us.

33:43.104 --> 33:47.017
We knew Garland was suffering,
but not like—

33:49.361 --> 33:52.228
- He's lost two fathers
in one day.

33:52.364 --> 33:55.401
- More than someone
should have to bear.

33:55.534 --> 33:56.569
Let's go talk with him.

33:56.701 --> 33:58.282
- No, he doesn't want
to talk to us.

33:58.411 --> 33:59.571
He needs her.

33:59.704 --> 34:01.911
- You're right.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.371
How can we help?

34:03.500 --> 34:07.084
- You can gather
the evidence

34:07.212 --> 34:09.578
so that we can hide it.

34:09.714 --> 34:11.921
- Evidence?
- She means Garland.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.251
- Yeah, if you could, um,
pick up the pieces

34:16.388 --> 34:19.095
so we can just put them
in this box,

34:19.224 --> 34:20.555
help us hide it.

34:21.851 --> 34:24.263
We've known Garland
for over 60 years.

34:24.396 --> 34:26.227
- It's the least thing
we can do for him.

34:26.356 --> 34:29.268
We'll start.
You go see to Nathan.

34:29.401 --> 34:32.313
- Thanks.

34:32.445 --> 34:35.573
Hey, um,
before the chief died,

34:38.285 --> 34:39.821
that may not want me here.

34:39.953 --> 34:42.786
Do you have any idea
what he was talking about?

34:42.914 --> 34:45.906
- No.

34:46.042 --> 34:48.249
Sorry, I...

34:48.378 --> 34:50.164
I guess we'll never know.

34:50.297 --> 34:53.755
- Yeah, okay.

34:57.095 --> 34:58.801
- You should tell her
what she needs to know

34:58.930 --> 35:00.511
before she finds out
on her own.

35:00.640 --> 35:01.755
- No.

35:01.891 --> 35:03.552
We should stay out of this
as long as we can.

35:03.685 --> 35:04.800
Let it sort itself out.

35:04.936 --> 35:05.971
- You're a fool.

35:06.104 --> 35:08.095
- Yeah, well,
I might be a fool,

35:08.231 --> 35:10.608
but we're still alive,
aren't we?

35:20.118 --> 35:22.951
- I can't imagine what
you're going through right now.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.992
I'm so sorry, Nathan.

35:27.125 --> 35:30.538
- You know what
I don't understand?

35:30.670 --> 35:33.457
Why'd you let him die?

35:36.134 --> 35:37.670
- What are you talking about?

35:37.802 --> 35:41.420
- He needed to hear
that you could help him,

35:41.556 --> 35:43.672
the same words
that you have given

35:43.808 --> 35:47.972
to every other troubled person
that we have dealt with!

35:50.357 --> 35:52.769
But you couldn't give
him that?

35:55.612 --> 35:56.818
[laughs]

35:58.490 --> 36:01.778
- He knew that there was
no good answer.

36:01.910 --> 36:03.866
He knew more
about the troubles than anyone.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.110
- You need
to leave me alone.

36:05.246 --> 36:06.406
Please.

36:10.502 --> 36:13.289
- That thing that
I've been trying to tell you...

36:16.007 --> 36:17.247
Your father knew.

36:17.384 --> 36:18.965
- Enough.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.012
Just go.

36:36.945 --> 36:39.311
- Duke, I'm not drinking
with you.

36:39.447 --> 36:41.062
- Come on, one drink.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.736
I insist.

36:43.868 --> 36:46.951
You really helped me today.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.071
I just want
to say thank you.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.572
- You're welcome.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.950
But that's as far as I go.

36:53.086 --> 36:55.293
You'll have to figure out
the rest on your own.

36:55.422 --> 36:58.164
- Julia...

36:58.299 --> 37:00.085
somebody out there
with this tattoo

37:00.218 --> 37:02.425
is gonna kill me...

37:02.554 --> 37:05.512
unless I kill them first.

37:05.640 --> 37:08.598
- This is my mother's world,
not mine.

37:08.727 --> 37:11.389
I'm not even sure
I'm gonna be here that long.

37:11.521 --> 37:13.637
And besides...

37:13.773 --> 37:16.310
I still don't like you
very much.

37:16.443 --> 37:19.185
- Hmm.

38:29.516 --> 38:31.302
- Hello, Nathan.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.051
- What the hell are you doing
in his chair?

38:35.188 --> 38:37.179
- I'm sorry for your loss.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.180
- Don't know what you mean.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.057
- Oh, yes, you do.

38:41.194 --> 38:45.437
Your father
was a good man, Nathan.

38:45.573 --> 38:48.565
You need to replace him
with an even better one.

38:48.701 --> 38:50.111
- Won't be you.

38:50.245 --> 38:52.361
- No, but with good friends,

38:52.497 --> 38:55.705
the right kind of friends,

38:55.834 --> 38:59.247
new chief of police
could do wonders for this town.

38:59.379 --> 39:01.620
- Friends?

39:01.756 --> 39:04.543
You mean thugs
like Max Hansen?

39:04.676 --> 39:06.667
- Don't call
your daddy names, Nathan.

39:06.803 --> 39:11.137
- I called my father
"'l'he Chief."

39:11.266 --> 39:14.429
I'll be damned if I'm gonna
let you fill his seat.

39:14.561 --> 39:17.143
- You already are...

39:17.272 --> 39:19.433
damned.

39:19.566 --> 39:22.524
Things are gonna change
in Haven, Nathan.

39:22.652 --> 39:25.564
I'm going to change them.

39:25.697 --> 39:28.734
So either you leave

39:28.867 --> 39:31.904
and find someplace else
to live your life,

39:32.036 --> 39:34.743
or you will suffer...

39:34.873 --> 39:37.034
like the rest of your kind.

39:50.555 --> 39:51.544
- Audrey.

39:56.060 --> 39:57.891
I knew I'd find you here.

39:58.021 --> 40:00.763
- I'm surprised you wanted
to find me anywhere.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.389
- Audrey, ljust—

40:02.525 --> 40:05.107
- No, it's—
it's okay, Nathan.

40:05.236 --> 40:06.612
- I just found the Rev

40:06.738 --> 40:09.320
in my father's office
measuring for drapes.

40:09.449 --> 40:11.986
- He wants to be chief?

40:12.118 --> 40:14.325
- He wants to control
whoever is.

40:14.454 --> 40:18.117
The last thing Haven needs
is the Rev

40:18.249 --> 40:21.116
and his self-righteous poison
running things.

40:21.252 --> 40:25.086
I don't know
what is happening.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.837
My dad was holding it
all together.

40:34.057 --> 40:37.470
- That's your job now.

40:37.602 --> 40:39.183
- I'm sorry I shut you out.

40:39.312 --> 40:41.177
- Nathan, I'm sorry too.

40:45.151 --> 40:48.939
You're the one person
that I can absolutely trust.

40:51.616 --> 40:53.322
And if you're gonna wear this,

40:53.451 --> 40:57.114
then we need to be honest
with each other.

40:57.246 --> 41:00.704
What's wrong?

41:00.833 --> 41:02.664
You felt that.
- Yeah.

41:02.794 --> 41:05.160
I can feel you.

41:05.296 --> 41:07.582
- How long have you known?

41:10.259 --> 41:12.841
- A while.

41:15.056 --> 41:18.219
I wasn't sure
what to think about it

41:18.351 --> 41:21.843
for a long time.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.060
- Hey.

41:23.189 --> 41:25.054
That thing—
that thing that l—

41:25.191 --> 41:29.355
that l was trying
to tell you...

41:29.487 --> 41:32.229
I think it might have—

41:32.365 --> 41:35.857
this might have something
to do with all that.

41:35.994 --> 41:37.859
I might be part of it.

41:37.996 --> 41:39.987
- Part of what?

41:40.123 --> 41:43.286
- I found out
something about Lucy,

41:43.418 --> 41:45.579
and it's really...

41:50.425 --> 41:53.041
It's really hard to believe.

41:53.177 --> 41:55.042
- She's not your mother?

41:55.179 --> 41:57.431
- It's way weirder than that.

42:05.648 --> 42:08.105
I am Lucy.

42:12.530 --> 42:13.394
- That's—

42:13.531 --> 42:14.566
- Don't.

42:14.699 --> 42:16.064
Don't say that
that's impossible,

42:16.200 --> 42:20.443
because whatever this is,
it's possible.

42:24.208 --> 42:25.948
- Excuse me.

42:26.085 --> 42:27.541
Audrey Parker?

42:27.670 --> 42:29.581
- I'm sorry.
Can I help you?

42:29.714 --> 42:31.250
- Are you Audrey Parker?

42:31.382 --> 42:32.246
- And who are you?

42:32.383 --> 42:33.463
- I'm with the FBI.

42:33.593 --> 42:34.878
Answer the question.

42:35.011 --> 42:37.377
- Oh, right, you're here
about Max Hansen.

42:37.513 --> 42:38.719
He's dead.

42:39.849 --> 42:42.215
- Haven PD.
Who are you?

42:42.351 --> 42:44.307
- I said I'm FBI.

42:44.437 --> 42:46.268
- Hey, hey, keep your hands
where I can see them.

42:46.397 --> 42:48.558
- What am I gonna do,
pull out another gun?

42:53.696 --> 42:55.857
My name is Special Agent
Audrey Parker.

42:58.367 --> 43:00.358
Who the hell are you?
