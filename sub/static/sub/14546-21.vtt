WEBVTT

00:02.453 --> 00:03.610
After someone dumps you

00:03.635 --> 00:07.063
and smashes your heart into
a million little pieces,

00:07.076 --> 00:09.372
sometimes you blame yourself.

00:09.925 --> 00:11.568
But not in this case.

00:15.836 --> 00:18.769
Tessa, would it be okay
if we had a word with you?

00:18.970 --> 00:20.596
Sorry, I'm not really
in the mood right now.

00:20.716 --> 00:24.500
Um, sometimes we inflect up
at the end of our sentences?

00:24.676 --> 00:26.809
But that doesn't mean
we're asking a question?

00:26.865 --> 00:28.904
You know, they do that. I've noticed.

00:29.324 --> 00:31.896
Wow. Okay. So what can I do for you ladies?

00:31.965 --> 00:34.317
Ryan shared with us that having your locker

00:34.373 --> 00:35.769
so visible from his locker

00:35.812 --> 00:38.372
is both distracting and upsetting to him.

00:38.492 --> 00:42.163
Ryan was wondering if you could
move your locker into there.

00:42.820 --> 00:45.248
Ryan would really appreciate it.

00:46.086 --> 00:47.226
Really?

00:47.420 --> 00:49.028
Ryan said that?

00:49.328 --> 00:50.897
Doesn't really sound like Ryan.

00:50.899 --> 00:53.501
It's mean, and it's
also kind of complicated.

00:53.621 --> 00:56.323
Are you sure someone else
didn't come up with that idea?

01:00.675 --> 01:02.979
No. It was totes Ryan.

01:05.670 --> 01:06.595
This isn't over.

01:06.602 --> 01:07.966
Oh. Okay.

01:08.022 --> 01:10.011
I know where you don't eat lunch!

01:10.131 --> 01:12.303
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:20.461 --> 01:23.420
So, how the big combo with Thessa go?

01:23.639 --> 01:25.403
Oh. Yeah.

01:25.933 --> 01:26.787
It didn't.

01:26.907 --> 01:28.235
But on the other hand...

01:28.269 --> 01:29.787
Coffee? I just brewed a pot.

01:29.821 --> 01:32.661
George, I will not be
distracted by your brewery.

01:33.208 --> 01:34.875
- Although I will take a cup.
- Yeah.

01:34.909 --> 01:36.196
Black, with six equals.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.461
Look, I meant to talk
to Tessa this morning.

01:39.497 --> 01:40.888
I really did, but, you know,

01:41.107 --> 01:44.254
she's... she's just getting
over her breakup with Ryan.

01:44.266 --> 01:46.087
Plus she slept in.

01:46.788 --> 01:48.326
Then it looked rainy out.

01:48.364 --> 01:50.341
George McGovern Altman.

01:51.017 --> 01:52.912
That is not my middle name.

01:52.919 --> 01:54.308
Are you afraid of your own daughter?

01:54.314 --> 01:55.365
Is that what's going on here?

01:55.485 --> 01:56.785
No. 

01:56.829 --> 01:59.064
But telling her I
unexpectedly sold the house...

01:59.107 --> 02:00.608
Well, you got a cash offer.

02:00.652 --> 02:02.003
They put a clock on you.

02:02.028 --> 02:04.021
They did. They put a clock to my head.

02:04.072 --> 02:05.239
It's a lot of pressure.

02:05.273 --> 02:06.214
I hear ya.

02:06.334 --> 02:07.796
I hear ya, too.

02:07.916 --> 02:10.961
Whoa! Sheila, what are you doing here?

02:10.973 --> 02:12.000
I'm working.

02:12.044 --> 02:13.852
Unlike you decadent bohemians,

02:13.890 --> 02:15.247
I don't have the luxury of sitting around

02:15.235 --> 02:16.983
sipping coffee at 8:00 A.M.,

02:17.002 --> 02:17.687
pantyless.

02:17.743 --> 02:20.997
I am 100% wearing a flesh-colored panty.

02:21.003 --> 02:22.623
She was talking about me.

02:22.657 --> 02:24.570
Hey. I thought it was
your job to sell the house,

02:24.582 --> 02:25.827
not occupy it.

02:25.846 --> 02:28.486
If I don't get this
dump through inspection,

02:28.511 --> 02:29.619
I don't get my commission,

02:29.644 --> 02:31.765
and the Shays are living
on crackers and tuna.

02:31.796 --> 02:34.567
Now does this look like mold to you or...

02:35.199 --> 02:36.768
coffee grounds. Mm.

02:36.888 --> 02:38.922
You're a blonde roast
boy. Should have known.

02:39.042 --> 02:41.718
Okay. Sheila, this is kind
of a private conversation.

02:41.749 --> 02:43.110
So if you don't mind...

02:43.144 --> 02:44.344
Fine.

02:44.362 --> 02:47.373
I am going to check the
discharge on your sump pump.

02:48.356 --> 02:49.931
Look, I don't blame you

02:49.945 --> 02:52.202
for being a little wary
of springing this on Tessa.

02:52.529 --> 02:55.989
Redheads in particular can be skittish.

02:56.308 --> 02:59.217
But she and I have a rapport.
Maybe I can feel her out

02:59.217 --> 03:01.413
on the whole us living together thing.

03:01.669 --> 03:03.271
- Co-parenting.
- Yes.

03:03.290 --> 03:05.404
Right. Right. Why not start now?

03:05.461 --> 03:06.737
You can talk to her after school.

03:06.968 --> 03:08.520
Okay. And you can pick up Dalia.

03:13.882 --> 03:15.659
Backseat, huh? Okay.

03:16.116 --> 03:17.668
Could you kill the air back here?

03:17.699 --> 03:19.038
Uh, sure.

03:19.488 --> 03:20.865
Good day at school?

03:24.261 --> 03:27.340
You might wonder why
I'm picking you up today

03:27.371 --> 03:29.091
instead of your mom. No big reason.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.925
Just thought we'd mix it up for once.

03:31.994 --> 03:34.034
And besides, I haven't gotten
to connect with you in a while.

03:34.485 --> 03:36.099
I'm not stupid, daddy Altman.

03:36.437 --> 03:37.594
I know what this is.

03:37.619 --> 03:39.990
You and mommy are at the
stage in your relationship

03:40.008 --> 03:41.622
where you've decided to move in together,

03:41.641 --> 03:43.262
only you're worried Tessa won't react well,

03:43.286 --> 03:44.619
so you sent mommy to deal with her

03:44.621 --> 03:47.741
while you pick me up in your
compact, fuel-efficient car.

03:48.892 --> 03:50.759
I'm sorry I had to break that to you.

03:50.879 --> 03:53.165
I know you and Tessa haven't

03:53.416 --> 03:54.823
always been the closest.

03:54.842 --> 03:57.332
Tessa and I are great. We're aces.

03:57.726 --> 03:59.353
Just this morning at school,

03:59.346 --> 04:01.687
I was helping her get through
her messy public breakup.

04:01.930 --> 04:04.640
If we lived in the same house,
I could help her even harder.

04:04.883 --> 04:06.866
That... I'm happy to hear that.

04:07.179 --> 04:10.010
You can drop me off just
up here on the right.

04:10.130 --> 04:11.909
- Oh. Okay.
- Keep the change.

04:12.198 --> 04:13.398
What's that?

04:14.484 --> 04:16.317
You don't have to...

04:16.370 --> 04:19.636
Oh, man, I just hope
it's not the wrong move,

04:19.649 --> 04:22.446
letting Dallas broach
this thing with Tessa.

04:22.566 --> 04:23.835
Oh, no.

04:23.891 --> 04:24.817
What?

04:25.145 --> 04:26.757
Oh, no.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.414
Carmen and Bob. 

04:29.860 --> 04:31.712
Look at him lappin' at her sample

04:31.718 --> 04:34.158
like a sailor on shore leave.

04:34.683 --> 04:36.204
He is really getting in there.

04:36.223 --> 04:38.369
That so-called "health care professional"

04:38.369 --> 04:40.002
learned the contents of my heart

04:39.983 --> 04:41.566
only to tear them asunder!

04:41.572 --> 04:42.942
Hey. Take... take it easy.

04:43.011 --> 04:45.820
For a therapist to go after
the love interest of a client

04:45.864 --> 04:47.547
is wrong in every way,

04:47.572 --> 04:49.718
but remember, before she was into him,

04:50.262 --> 04:51.695
she wasn't into you.

04:52.133 --> 04:54.780
You need to move on, Noah.

04:56.320 --> 04:58.866
You're right. I need to move on.

04:59.053 --> 05:01.387
No matter how painful...

05:01.944 --> 05:04.647
I need to learn to lick my own spoon.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:13.113 --> 05:14.533
It was hard to concentrate

05:14.527 --> 05:16.936
on whatever crap I was
supposed to concentrate on

05:16.967 --> 05:20.145
when all I could do was think
about how to get back at Dalia.

05:20.183 --> 05:22.516
I could tell everyone her biggest secret...

05:22.754 --> 05:24.568
that she hooked up with Jenna.

05:24.744 --> 05:27.240
It would just be, like,
stooping to her level.

05:27.957 --> 05:31.088
Yeah. And knowing her, the
whole thing would backfire

05:31.094 --> 05:33.303
and become some cool trend.

05:33.423 --> 05:35.630
It kind of already is.

05:36.657 --> 05:37.558
You wanna make out?

05:37.983 --> 05:39.397
Eh, I have gum.

05:39.897 --> 05:42.156
What I really need to do is

05:42.755 --> 05:44.971
find Dalia's biggest weakness and

05:45.091 --> 05:47.042
ruthlessly exploit it.

05:47.726 --> 05:48.993
There is another path...

05:49.028 --> 05:51.146
I mean, if you're open
enough to explore it.

05:51.180 --> 05:52.280
I said I had gum.

05:52.314 --> 05:54.366
Oh... it's not... not that.

05:55.951 --> 05:57.435
It's this.

06:00.773 --> 06:02.240
"Meow mix"?

06:02.274 --> 06:03.741
It's exactly what you think it is.

06:04.040 --> 06:05.980
A recording of yours truly

06:05.980 --> 06:10.053
meowing some of the top hits
of the late '80s/early '90s.

06:10.097 --> 06:12.888
Just one listen to my powerful rendition

06:12.900 --> 06:14.815
of Bonnie Tyler's "Total
Eclipse of the Heart"

06:14.877 --> 06:16.692
and suddenly seeking revenge

06:16.729 --> 06:19.720
will seem like, I don't know,
"What a Fool Believes"...

06:20.489 --> 06:23.073
which I also happen to meow on the B-side.

06:25.231 --> 06:26.877
Hey. Do you mind?

06:26.871 --> 06:28.791
Your dad said it was
cool for us to come in?

06:28.911 --> 06:30.549
It was recently brought to our attention

06:30.574 --> 06:32.727
that you still have
Ryan's letterman jacket?

06:32.847 --> 06:35.436
Gee, I wonder who brought
that to your attention.

06:35.423 --> 06:37.262
We'd rather be discreet and not say?

06:37.300 --> 06:39.696
Dalia. I saw her texting with you guys.

06:39.740 --> 06:42.124
So I know it was Dalia.

06:43.776 --> 06:46.885
Would you guys be interested
in hearing someone meow

06:46.891 --> 06:49.369
Vanessa Williams' "Save the Best for Last"?

06:50.771 --> 06:52.329
No? 'Kay.

06:55.902 --> 06:56.891
What happened?

06:57.116 --> 06:58.717
I customized it.

06:58.837 --> 07:00.369
You mutilated it.

07:00.644 --> 07:02.315
Ryan gave me that jacket.

07:02.346 --> 07:04.104
And the only reason you're taking it back

07:04.142 --> 07:06.213
is because Dalia told you to,

07:06.213 --> 07:08.146
'cause she knew it would hurt me!

07:08.196 --> 07:10.217
Which it did.

07:13.289 --> 07:15.879
Okay, here we go.

07:17.650 --> 07:19.527
Uh, I don't wanna sway to it.

07:19.586 --> 07:20.928
- Do we have to sway to it?
- Yes.

07:21.288 --> 07:22.899
As Lisa tried to help me

07:22.912 --> 07:25.064
find a healthy outlet for my feelings...

07:25.409 --> 07:27.529
Noah was busy pursuing an angle

07:27.535 --> 07:29.560
that was slightly more sinister.

07:30.006 --> 07:34.650
And that's class. Namaste, my brothers.

07:39.411 --> 07:40.474
Hey!

07:41.244 --> 07:44.059
Namaste, Dr. Bob. What?

07:44.071 --> 07:46.730
Fancy running into you
here at the Open Lotus.

07:46.850 --> 07:50.781
I guess our celestial orbits
are fated to intersect.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.098
Perhaps.

07:52.524 --> 07:54.251
Or perhaps...

07:54.463 --> 07:55.790
you're stalking me.

07:57.300 --> 07:58.624
Perhaps.

07:58.655 --> 08:01.233
But look, if I were, it
would just be to thank you.

08:01.637 --> 08:02.315
To thank me?

08:02.359 --> 08:05.050
Was I angry at first? Naturally.

08:05.250 --> 08:06.984
I wanted to see you dead.

08:08.679 --> 08:12.583
But then I realized I was
clinging to a foolish dream,

08:12.615 --> 08:15.568
like a... like a little
child holding on to a balloon.

08:15.612 --> 08:17.185
And thanks to you,

08:17.220 --> 08:19.967
I was able to take that
beautiful round balloon...

08:21.023 --> 08:22.624
and let her go.

08:22.658 --> 08:24.428
- I'm happy to hear that.
- Yeah.

08:24.460 --> 08:25.191
But, but, but...

08:25.254 --> 08:27.112
don't nama-go just yet.

08:27.163 --> 08:29.214
Nama-stay for a second.

08:29.427 --> 08:32.534
I want to thank you. I want
to show you my gratitude.

08:32.655 --> 08:34.582
- That's really not necessary, no.
- Hey.

08:34.587 --> 08:35.982
I got an idea.

08:36.102 --> 08:38.328
Why don't you come into
my office for a cleaning?

08:38.448 --> 08:41.032
Free. On the house. 

08:42.133 --> 08:45.143
It has been a while since
I've been in for a cleaning.

08:45.624 --> 08:47.001
I... I shouldn't admit this,

08:47.038 --> 08:50.817
but I've always been a bit
terrified of the dentist, so...

08:50.937 --> 08:53.714
Bob, there is nothing to be afraid of.

08:54.026 --> 08:55.271
Nothing.

08:55.465 --> 08:57.361
As Noah's revenge scenario

08:57.373 --> 08:59.651
was falling beautifully into place...

08:59.889 --> 09:02.211
mine was barely taking shape.

09:02.192 --> 09:03.368
Drowning.

09:03.992 --> 09:05.092
Pros...

09:05.127 --> 09:06.396
Lethal.

09:07.016 --> 09:08.596
Bloated corpse.

09:08.917 --> 09:10.707
Fish-eaten face.

09:11.833 --> 09:12.821
Cons...

09:12.941 --> 09:16.400
One might say I was avoiding
feeling bad about Ryan

09:16.421 --> 09:18.355
by focusing all my anger on Dalia,

09:18.390 --> 09:20.580
but one should mind their own business.

09:20.624 --> 09:21.550
Hi, hon.

09:22.063 --> 09:24.490
Just wanted to see how you
were doing post-breakup.

09:24.559 --> 09:25.560
Oh, I'm doing great.

09:25.772 --> 09:27.261
Someone tell you I wasn't doing great?

09:27.280 --> 09:29.808
T-Pain, you don't have to pretend with me.

09:29.852 --> 09:31.116
I know you're hurtin'.

09:31.184 --> 09:32.436
But there is a place

09:32.556 --> 09:34.758
where all your troubles will melt away

09:34.789 --> 09:36.757
like so much provolone.

09:39.025 --> 09:40.239
So what you do is,

09:40.295 --> 09:43.148
you roll your noodles into a big ball,

09:43.173 --> 09:45.588
along with all the sauce and cheese

09:45.588 --> 09:48.466
and shame and anger and hurt,

09:48.717 --> 09:50.631
and then you just stuff it right down.

09:51.789 --> 09:52.519
Mmm.

09:52.639 --> 09:54.648
Speaking of eating things,

09:54.768 --> 09:58.771
does Dalia have any
life-threatening food allergies

09:58.783 --> 09:59.666
I should know about?

09:59.691 --> 10:01.280
I don't think so. Night terrors?

10:01.400 --> 10:05.297
What does she fear will
come for her when she sleeps?

10:05.653 --> 10:09.339
Tessa, is it my imagination,
or are you starting

10:09.333 --> 10:12.295
to take a sisterly
interest in my baby girl?

10:12.329 --> 10:15.583
Are you finally starting to
consider my little Dalia doodle

10:15.608 --> 10:17.898
as part of your family? Because...

10:17.922 --> 10:21.182
Let me be perfectly
clear about one thing...

10:21.371 --> 10:23.641
there is nothing doodly about Dalia.

10:23.659 --> 10:26.737
And although you two may
share superficial similarities,

10:26.857 --> 10:27.957
you are a nice person,

10:28.001 --> 10:29.978
and she is, in fact, the devil.

10:39.908 --> 10:42.397
Well, that... that sounds
like it was a disaster.

10:42.441 --> 10:43.743
I don't know what to tell you, George.

10:43.774 --> 10:46.571
I had to abort mission and
take my tagliatelle to go.

10:46.596 --> 10:48.336
Did... did you bring up
the offer on the house?

10:48.354 --> 10:49.849
I didn't get the chance to.

10:49.893 --> 10:52.577
That girl of yours has a
lot of anger in her heart,

10:52.602 --> 10:55.110
and she seems to be
directing it all at Dalia.

10:55.341 --> 10:58.175
Maybe we should put this
whole move-in plan on hold.

10:58.212 --> 11:00.733
We can't. They're pushing to
close in the next two weeks.

11:00.745 --> 11:03.854
Well, then you need to get
up there and talk to her.

11:04.073 --> 11:06.113
Right. Okay.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.078
I will do that.

11:08.340 --> 11:10.149
It makes sense. That's
what needs to be done,

11:10.161 --> 11:11.944
so that's what I'm gonna do...

11:12.395 --> 11:15.454
right after I take out the trash.

11:15.574 --> 11:17.901
The longer you wait,
the harder it's gonna be.

11:18.777 --> 11:19.609
Right.

11:19.609 --> 11:22.538
Or maybe she'll... she'll mellow, you know?

11:22.563 --> 11:24.048
Like a... like a fine wine.

11:24.528 --> 11:25.399
Yeah.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.318
Let's... let's let her breathe.

11:32.823 --> 11:35.407
When my direct approach
to getting intel on Dalia

11:35.426 --> 11:36.444
didn't pan out,

11:36.740 --> 11:38.880
I decided to go a little more covert.

11:38.914 --> 11:40.297
All right. Picture's up.

11:41.094 --> 11:43.841
Although, uh, you really
shouldn't be watching this.

11:43.961 --> 11:45.674
It's true. We don't have a warrant.

11:45.794 --> 11:48.921
No, I meant 'cause the
resolution's only 480p.

11:48.977 --> 11:52.250
Hello? 2008 called, they want
their component cables back...

11:52.275 --> 11:53.345
Shut up, Reggie.

11:53.563 --> 11:56.673
She's glossing. Can we
get tighter on this gloss?

11:56.723 --> 11:58.663
Okay, I'm not Wes Anderson?

11:58.682 --> 12:01.754
Now what is it that you're
hoping to gain from this?

12:01.804 --> 12:04.156
Information I can use to destroy her.

12:04.750 --> 12:07.184
Okay. Well, if it's
destruction that you're after,

12:07.208 --> 12:08.916
I have a far better plan.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.581
If this is at all cat related...

12:11.644 --> 12:12.607
Step one...

12:13.127 --> 12:15.273
We undergo training to become certified

12:15.285 --> 12:18.307
as two of society's most
important professionals.

12:19.089 --> 12:20.903
Notary publics. Of course.

12:21.023 --> 12:23.287
Then we spend 20, 25 years

12:23.300 --> 12:26.071
building a reputation in
the Chatswin community.

12:26.191 --> 12:27.272
One day,

12:27.666 --> 12:28.993
who's to walk in our door

12:29.037 --> 12:32.384
needing a notarized signature
on a mortgage document?

12:32.784 --> 12:34.674
Is it time-sensitive?

12:34.955 --> 12:36.263
You bet it is.

12:36.294 --> 12:37.939
She needs it by the end of the day.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.684
What do we do?

12:40.579 --> 12:42.062
We deny her.

12:42.182 --> 12:43.908
Shh. Something's happening.

12:44.711 --> 12:45.979
Look at that little slut.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.618
She's all over Ryan.

12:48.632 --> 12:49.752
Did you see that?

12:50.467 --> 12:51.641
She knows.

12:51.761 --> 12:54.444
Hey, how much does a
bed like this go for new?

12:54.431 --> 12:55.389
Get out, Reggie.

12:55.457 --> 12:57.339
Yeah, okay. That makes sense.

12:58.367 --> 12:59.718
I can't believe this.

13:00.444 --> 13:02.643
Outsmarted by Dalia?

13:03.059 --> 13:05.743
What has happened to me? It's like...

13:06.216 --> 13:08.250
I've lost my edge.

13:19.088 --> 13:21.072
Your lesbian boots.

13:21.441 --> 13:24.050
Sorry I let you down, friends.

13:25.176 --> 13:29.637
Sorry I started wearing
ballet flats and Chuck Taylors.

13:29.950 --> 13:33.122
I am sorry I forgot about us.

13:33.242 --> 13:35.744
Do you guys need a minute?
'Cause I can come back.

13:36.082 --> 13:38.046
I'm the one who's coming back, Lisa.

13:39.179 --> 13:41.500
I'm the one who's coming back.

13:43.352 --> 13:44.785
Yeah, you is.

13:48.007 --> 13:51.148
Is this procedure going
to be at all painful?

13:51.185 --> 13:54.608
I have a very low threshold for discomfort.

13:54.827 --> 13:56.629
I bet that's not true.

13:57.342 --> 13:58.474
So...

13:58.493 --> 14:00.833
you got any travel plans coming up?

14:01.089 --> 14:02.359
Funny you should ask.

14:02.409 --> 14:05.113
We were thinking about trying out

14:05.106 --> 14:08.122
this new eco-resort in Costa Rica.

14:08.153 --> 14:10.424
C... Costa Rica?

14:13.415 --> 14:15.317
I am so sorry.

14:15.323 --> 14:19.903
Let me just silence this sext from Carmen.

14:27.736 --> 14:28.631
Open wide.

14:36.352 --> 14:39.342
You just cried down my throat!

14:40.681 --> 14:43.203
You stole my true love! 

14:43.241 --> 14:46.294
I knew this was a mistake. I
never should have come here.

14:46.325 --> 14:47.633
Tell me, doctor. Tell me...

14:47.677 --> 14:50.824
wh... what magic arrow did
you use to pierce her heart?

14:50.868 --> 14:53.508
There is no magic, Noah.

14:53.520 --> 14:55.216
There's no big secret.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.429
I just listen to her.

15:00.021 --> 15:01.404
Come again now?

15:01.660 --> 15:03.230
In my experience,

15:03.350 --> 15:06.346
all women ever want is to feel heard.

15:06.466 --> 15:09.068
And I am a very good listener.

15:11.220 --> 15:12.678
You listen?

15:15.481 --> 15:17.345
I don't think I can do that.

15:18.534 --> 15:20.305
I'm not trying to blame-shift.

15:20.425 --> 15:22.188
But you are partly responsible.

15:22.213 --> 15:23.883
I mean, the house wasn't
even on the market.

15:24.003 --> 15:26.680
If you are done whining
and crumbing up my carpet,

15:26.800 --> 15:29.302
I'm ready to drop some science.

15:29.583 --> 15:30.881
Please.

15:30.899 --> 15:33.775
Every teenager loves to scream and shout

15:33.800 --> 15:35.840
and text and tweet about how unfair it is

15:35.902 --> 15:36.988
that they're not in charge.

15:37.247 --> 15:39.587
And the fact is, being in charge

15:39.625 --> 15:41.358
is the last thing that they want.

15:41.377 --> 15:42.997
And despite the fact that many of them

15:42.991 --> 15:44.073
dress as old French whores,

15:44.098 --> 15:46.951
they are still children,
and they're scared.

15:47.145 --> 15:49.053
I've got a stack of
parenting books right there

15:49.059 --> 15:50.617
that says the same exact thing...

15:50.737 --> 15:52.707
stop being her friend

15:52.713 --> 15:54.628
and start being in charge.

15:54.646 --> 15:55.841
I'm in charge.

15:55.897 --> 15:57.011
Then prove it.

15:57.036 --> 15:58.381
Be the bigger animal.

15:58.613 --> 16:01.716
Tell her, "daddy bear is
here, and he is in control."

16:01.836 --> 16:03.236
Daddy bear.

16:04.294 --> 16:05.207
I like that.

16:05.327 --> 16:08.529
Yeah. In control. I can do that.

16:08.649 --> 16:10.249
Wow, all this talk about authority,

16:10.237 --> 16:11.989
it reminds me I have to
update Fred's chore chart.

16:12.333 --> 16:14.584
Finished hand-washing
your underwear, Sheila.

16:14.597 --> 16:16.687
Oh. Two more stars, you get a pizza party.

16:16.939 --> 16:18.358
Brawr!

16:18.390 --> 16:20.458
Pepperoni will be in attendance!

16:20.753 --> 16:22.586
♪ Ditto for my best friend ♪

16:22.630 --> 16:23.659
♪ fruit punch ♪

16:23.779 --> 16:25.046
I love fruit punch.

16:29.832 --> 16:32.447
Once I discovered my old New York boots,

16:32.490 --> 16:35.387
it was like I discovered
my old New York self.

16:35.562 --> 16:38.947
Because before I softened
into Ryan's girlfriend...

16:38.991 --> 16:40.774
I was kind of a badass.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.907
And I wasn't gonna let some vapid,

16:42.970 --> 16:45.781
self-obsessed mall queen bully me.

16:48.432 --> 16:50.709
Oops. Sorry.

16:51.091 --> 16:52.330
In that green jacket,

16:52.311 --> 16:54.282
I thought you were a garbage can.

16:55.696 --> 16:58.430
If you ever want to enter into
a legally binding agreement...

16:58.468 --> 17:00.720
Lisa? I got this.

17:01.333 --> 17:04.643
After endless hours of
considering endless ways

17:04.692 --> 17:06.112
to get back at Dalia,

17:06.175 --> 17:07.895
the answer was finally crystal clear...

17:07.933 --> 17:09.372
Dalia was a punk,

17:09.646 --> 17:12.868
and punks jump up to get beat down.

17:22.204 --> 17:24.794
You know, for a small
man, you fight like a girl.

17:29.255 --> 17:30.844
Hi-yah!

17:45.651 --> 17:47.036
Jenna says hi.

17:47.097 --> 17:48.386
Ryan says hi.

17:48.436 --> 17:49.643
Your dad says hi.

17:49.637 --> 17:51.395
Your mom says hi.

18:03.152 --> 18:04.109
Where'd he go?

18:04.153 --> 18:05.548
Up here, bitch.

18:13.562 --> 18:14.264
Girls!

18:14.302 --> 18:17.261
That's it! I want to see
both of you in my office!

18:17.261 --> 18:18.683
Now!

18:19.795 --> 18:22.222
Let go of each other's hair.

18:22.471 --> 18:24.186
Fine. Keep pulling each other's hair.

18:24.205 --> 18:25.394
But follow me to my office.

18:29.595 --> 18:31.110
Not my eyelash extensions.

18:31.075 --> 18:33.031
Please! I just got them sewn in.

18:34.472 --> 18:36.098
What happened to me?

18:36.218 --> 18:40.071
How did I become this
violent, blood-thirsty maniac?

18:40.191 --> 18:42.743
I'm gonna give you one chance

18:42.761 --> 18:44.932
to apologize for being an unrelenting bitch

18:44.960 --> 18:46.590
since day one.

18:47.666 --> 18:49.447
Too little too late!

19:01.000 --> 19:02.375
And?

19:02.551 --> 19:04.038
Didn't hurt a bit.

19:04.158 --> 19:05.822
That's the topical. It's a good topical.

19:05.805 --> 19:06.888
Always ask for some.

19:06.922 --> 19:08.531
I will.

19:10.708 --> 19:12.729
I wish you and Carmen...

19:13.261 --> 19:15.238
every happiness.

19:15.431 --> 19:17.548
You'll find your happiness, too, someday.

19:17.784 --> 19:19.917
I just know it.

19:20.903 --> 19:22.821
I feel like I already have.

19:24.134 --> 19:25.586
That's great.

19:25.817 --> 19:29.127
You're gonna... be numb for
the next couple of hours,

19:29.078 --> 19:30.547
but then after that...

19:31.397 --> 19:33.231
you'll feel everything.

19:38.068 --> 19:40.834
Daddy bear. Daddy bear.

19:42.208 --> 19:43.811
Just be the bear.

19:47.784 --> 19:49.818
Okay. Here we go.

19:51.250 --> 19:52.598
Hey, Tess. Welcome home.

19:52.658 --> 19:53.802
Oh, I sold the house.

19:53.853 --> 19:54.341
What?

19:54.461 --> 19:56.312
Yeah. What...

19:56.972 --> 19:58.070
happened to your face?

19:58.108 --> 19:59.897
Never mind my face.

20:00.109 --> 20:01.555
What did you just say?

20:01.568 --> 20:03.251
You look like you've
been run over by a truck.

20:03.257 --> 20:05.034
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I fell.

20:05.064 --> 20:06.597
You sold the house?

20:07.311 --> 20:08.838
We're moving?

20:09.702 --> 20:10.784
Yes!

20:11.128 --> 20:12.448
Thank you, God!

20:12.492 --> 20:14.900
Okay. Okay. There's no... no God involved.

20:14.907 --> 20:16.791
We're moving, but not out of Chatswin.

20:17.422 --> 20:21.913
Dallas is gonna put her
place on the market, too.

20:23.115 --> 20:24.397
So are you telling me

20:24.409 --> 20:27.782
I have to share a house... with Dalia?

20:28.087 --> 20:31.560
Okay. Okay. Now I know you and Dalia

20:31.590 --> 20:34.401
have had your ups and downs, but...

20:34.760 --> 20:37.154
you know, I think living
with... with her and Dallas

20:37.179 --> 20:39.788
is gonna... round out our family.

20:39.800 --> 20:40.826
It's gonna be good for us.

20:41.014 --> 20:43.673
"Good for us"? Are you out of your mind?

20:43.729 --> 20:44.736
O... okay, Tessa...

20:44.724 --> 20:46.939
Do you wanna know what happened to my face?

20:47.390 --> 20:48.573
Yeah.

20:48.607 --> 20:49.807
Dalia.

20:50.486 --> 20:51.519
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

20:51.544 --> 20:52.908
And I happened to hers.

20:52.933 --> 20:55.363
And let me tell you something,
she looks a lot worse than me.

20:57.443 --> 20:59.052
That is her hair.

20:59.172 --> 21:01.072
And part of her scalp.

21:01.653 --> 21:02.805
P... part of her scalp?

21:02.838 --> 21:03.838
Yeah, George.

21:03.873 --> 21:05.232
And for that reason,

21:05.282 --> 21:07.754
Dalia and I will never
live under the same roof.

21:07.779 --> 21:10.552
Never. Not ever.

21:11.059 --> 21:12.392
So...

21:13.468 --> 21:15.326
make your decision carefully.

21:16.922 --> 21:19.079
I've made my decision, Tessa.

21:19.105 --> 21:21.451
That's... that's not gonna change.

21:22.333 --> 21:23.565
Fine.

21:23.947 --> 21:26.337
Then... so have I.
