00:18.602 --> 00:21.021
<i>I've been down</i>
<i>and read this case file.</i>

00:21.355 --> 00:23.941
<i>Every interview,</i>
<i>everything that's in that file.</i>

00:24.900 --> 00:25.901
<i>Where you live...</i>

00:26.235 --> 00:28.654
Man 2: <i>I know it.</i>
<i>That's what gets me, man.</i>

00:28.737 --> 00:31.281
Man 1: <i>You know?</i>
<i>Not a lot of very good suspects in there.</i>

00:31.365 --> 00:32.366
<i>I know it.</i>

00:32.908 --> 00:35.494
Man 3: <i>This girl passed</i>
<i>on the street and he said, "I'd like...</i>

00:35.744 --> 00:38.038
<i>I'd like to rape her and kill her."</i>

00:40.374 --> 00:44.336
<i>He had the knife in his hand like this.</i>
<i>And he was stabbing.</i>

00:44.419 --> 00:45.420
Man 1: Hard?
<i>-Yes.</i>

00:45.504 --> 00:48.799
Man 1: <i>How hard? Show me how hard.</i>
<i>-Enough to get the full blade in.</i>

00:50.217 --> 00:52.344
Man 1:
<i>Did she beg y'all not to hurt her or...?</i>

00:52.427 --> 00:55.514
<i>She goes, "Tommy, I didn't think</i>
<i>you'd ever do anything like this."</i>

00:58.016 --> 00:59.935
<i>We had it all planned out, you know...</i>

01:00.018 --> 01:02.688
Man 1: <i>What were you planning on doing</i>
<i>with her after you got her?</i>

01:03.272 --> 01:04.147
<i>Raping her.</i>

01:04.731 --> 01:06.608
Man 1: <i>Raping her and then killing her?</i>
-<i>Yes.</i>

01:13.115 --> 01:15.325
<i>I knew I wouldn't have done it</i>
<i>if I wasn't drunk.</i>

01:15.409 --> 01:17.411
<i>'Cause I thought it was just a dream.</i>

23:23.944 --> 23:25.279
<i>So we stopped at, uh...</i>

23:25.404 --> 23:27.781
<i>McAnally's to get change</i>
<i>for the poker game.</i>

23:28.782 --> 23:30.284
<i>And I waited in the pickup.</i>

23:30.367 --> 23:32.870
<i>My nephew went inside, Lenny.</i>

23:33.537 --> 23:36.874
<i>And he came back out in a little bit</i>
<i>and said there wasn't anybody in there.</i>

23:37.333 --> 23:40.419
<i>We went in and kinda looked</i>
<i>the place over. Discovered that</i>

23:40.502 --> 23:42.254
<i>Figured that something was wrong.</i>

23:42.338 --> 23:43.714
<i>So we called the police.</i>

23:54.141 --> 23:56.393
Gene:<i> I know it was her</i>
<i>that left as we pulled up.</i>

25:41.206 --> 25:44.543
Man 1: <i>Okay, Tommy,</i>
<i>I've got a few things I need to say first.</i>

25:44.626 --> 25:47.546
<i>The date today is October 18th, 1984.</i>

25:47.629 --> 25:48.881
<i>We're at the headquarters office</i>

25:48.964 --> 25:51.675
<i>of the Oklahoma State Bureau</i>
<i>of Investigation located in Oklahoma City.</i>

25:51.759 --> 25:53.761
<i>I'm Deputy Inspector Rusty Featherstone.</i>

25:53.844 --> 25:57.097
<i>Present also in the room,</i>
<i>is Special Agent Gary Rogers of the OSBI.</i>

25:57.181 --> 25:58.307
<i>Out of the Ada office.</i>

25:58.390 --> 25:59.641
<i>Captain Dennis Smith</i>

25:59.725 --> 26:01.852
<i>of the Ada Police Department,</i>
<i>Detective Division.</i>

26:01.935 --> 26:04.104
<i>I know we've already talked about it</i>
<i>a little bit,</i>

26:04.188 --> 26:08.192
<i>but what I'd like you to do at this point,</i>
<i>is just start on that afternoon,</i>

26:08.275 --> 26:10.277
<i>and just in your own words,</i>
<i>at your own speed,</i>

26:10.360 --> 26:12.738
<i>I want you to go step by step through</i>
<i>everything that happened</i>

26:12.821 --> 26:14.907
<i>through the rest of that evening,</i>
<i>involving this girl.</i>

26:14.990 --> 26:15.991
<i>Okay?</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

26:16.075 --> 26:17.618
Featherstone:<i> Just go ahead and begin.</i>

26:39.014 --> 26:40.724
<i>Can you tell me</i>
<i>what her blouse looked like,</i>

26:40.808 --> 26:41.725
<i>that she was wearing?</i>

26:42.434 --> 26:43.310
<i>It was...</i>

26:45.437 --> 26:46.271
<i>It was...</i>

26:46.939 --> 26:48.232
<i>white with little blue...</i>

26:49.316 --> 26:51.110
<i>uh, roses on it.</i>

26:51.610 --> 26:52.945
<i>White with blue roses.</i>

27:26.353 --> 27:27.771
<i>I... I was at a...</i>

27:28.063 --> 27:29.398
<i>keg party.</i>

27:30.065 --> 27:31.942
<i>And I ran into a couple of guys.</i>

27:32.025 --> 27:35.737
<i>Asked me if I wanted to go riding around</i>
<i>with them and go get high,</i>

27:35.821 --> 27:38.198
<i>and drink some beer.</i>
<i>And I told 'em, "Sure."</i>

28:23.535 --> 28:27.122
<i>Titsworth, he grabbed money</i>
<i>out of the register,</i>

28:27.206 --> 28:28.624
<i>and we went out to the pickup.</i>

28:28.707 --> 28:30.125
Featherstone:<i> Where did you go from there?</i>

28:30.209 --> 28:31.460
<i>Out to the power plant.</i>

28:31.752 --> 28:33.879
<i>Featherstone:</i>
<i>What did he say he was gonna do with her?</i>

28:34.129 --> 28:36.131
<i>He told me that he was going to kill her.</i>

28:52.439 --> 28:54.942
Featherstone:<i> What was the purpose</i>
<i>of taking her with you?</i>

28:55.484 --> 28:56.360
<i>From the store?</i>

28:57.986 --> 29:00.697
<i>To keep from her...</i>
<i>coming to y'all and letting y'all know.</i>

29:00.781 --> 29:03.033
<i>I mean, was that the plan, though,</i>
<i>whenever you went there?</i>

29:03.116 --> 29:04.493
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

29:04.826 --> 29:06.828
<i>We had it all planned out, you know, to...</i>

29:07.287 --> 29:09.873
<i>What were you planning on doing</i>
<i>with her after you got her?</i>

29:10.540 --> 29:12.292
<i>Raping her.</i>
<i>-Raping her and</i>

29:12.376 --> 29:13.794
<i>then killing her and getting rid of her?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

29:13.877 --> 29:14.711
<i>Okay.</i>

29:26.515 --> 29:29.685
<i>As we was going to McAnally's,</i>
<i>we stopped there at the apartments,</i>

29:30.602 --> 29:34.106
<i>and decided to smoke some pot</i>
<i>and get high and everything.</i>

29:34.189 --> 29:35.190
<i>We drank some.</i>

29:42.614 --> 29:45.450
<i>Then when we got--</i>
<i>We planned it out before we got there.</i>

29:45.909 --> 29:47.452
<i>And then, when we got there...</i>

29:48.412 --> 29:49.246
<i>Odell...</i>

29:50.080 --> 29:51.957
<i>set it up for us and everything.</i>

29:53.834 --> 29:55.627
<i>He took her out of the store.</i>

29:55.961 --> 29:57.671
<i>Brought her to the truck.</i>

29:57.754 --> 29:59.965
Featherstone: <i>Where were y'all at?</i><i>Karl?</i>

30:00.048 --> 30:01.508
<i>Right there by the gas pumps.</i>

30:54.102 --> 30:56.188
Featherstone: <i>Was she scared?</i>
<i>-She was scared.</i>

30:56.313 --> 30:59.608
Featherstone: <i>What was she saying?</i>
<i>-She was hollering for help.</i>

31:00.817 --> 31:03.028
<i>And then there was nobody around</i>
<i>for to help.</i>

31:43.151 --> 31:44.236
Featherstone: <i>So...</i>

31:44.319 --> 31:46.488
<i>Odell Titsworth crawled up inside</i>
<i>the pickup.</i>

31:46.571 --> 31:47.531
Fontenot: <i>Yes.</i>

31:47.614 --> 31:49.074
<i>Did he have something in his hand?</i>

31:49.157 --> 31:51.284
<i>Had his knife.</i>
<i>-</i>Featherstone: <i>Was it open?</i>

31:51.368 --> 31:54.830
<i>Yes, it was open.</i>
<i>And he... he was attempting to stab her.</i>

31:54.913 --> 31:56.748
<i>And...</i>
<i>-</i>Featherstone: <i>Did you see him stab her?</i>

31:56.832 --> 31:59.042
<i>He was stabbing her.</i>
<i>-</i>Featherstone: <i>How did he do it?</i>

31:59.126 --> 32:01.336
<i>He had the knife in his hand, like this.</i>
<i>-All right.</i>

32:01.420 --> 32:03.547
<i>And he was... stabbing.</i>

32:03.630 --> 32:04.756
Featherstone: <i>Hard?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

32:04.840 --> 32:05.674
<i>How hard?</i>

32:05.757 --> 32:07.968
<i>Show me how hard.</i>
<i>-Enough to get the full blade in.</i>

32:08.468 --> 32:09.302
<i>Like that.</i>

32:12.139 --> 32:15.725
Featherstone: <i>Where was the first place</i>
<i>that she was cut with the knife?</i>

32:16.476 --> 32:19.896
<i>In her side. Right here in the side,</i>
<i>that's where Titsworth cut her.</i>

32:20.522 --> 32:22.315
<i>When he started to rape her, he goes,</i>

32:22.399 --> 32:25.485
<i>"If you don't cooperate with me</i>
<i>and everything,"</i>

32:25.569 --> 32:27.279
<i>he says, "I'll cut you deeper."</i>

32:27.362 --> 32:32.033
<i>After that, me and Odell stood there</i>
<i>and holded her while Tommy raped her.</i>

32:32.117 --> 32:32.951
<i>Okay.</i>

32:33.034 --> 32:37.539
<i>She had tremendous cuts all over her body,</i>
<i>all in her sides and on her legs.</i>

32:37.622 --> 32:40.250
Featherstone: <i>Were they deep cuts?</i>
-<i>And on the side of her neck.</i>

32:40.333 --> 32:42.002
<i>Yeah, the ones in her stomach was.</i>

32:42.085 --> 32:46.006
<i>How could you tell they were deep cuts?</i>
<i>-I could see her ribs and her insides.</i>

32:46.089 --> 32:47.841
Featherstone: <i>Was she saying anything?</i>

32:47.924 --> 32:50.552
<i>She was hollering for help</i>
<i>and telling us to stop.</i>

32:50.844 --> 32:52.679
Featherstone: <i>Do you believe that she died</i>

32:52.762 --> 32:55.515
<i>due to any other reason,</i>
<i>other than the stab wounds?</i>

32:55.599 --> 32:58.143
<i>No, that's what she died of,</i>
<i>the stab wounds.</i>

32:58.518 --> 33:01.146
Featherstone: <i>How many times did you cut</i>
<i>her with the knife, Tommy?</i>

33:01.229 --> 33:04.191
<i>Twice. Once upon her side</i>
<i>and once down her arm.</i>

33:04.566 --> 33:06.943
Featherstone: <i>What do you mean,</i>
<i>you had her "under control"?</i>

33:07.235 --> 33:09.196
<i>Well, she was more or less giving up.</i>

33:09.362 --> 33:10.197
<i>Okay.</i>

33:10.280 --> 33:11.239
<i>At the end.</i>

33:11.573 --> 33:13.658
Featherstone:
<i>Try and beg y'all not to hurt her or...?</i>

33:14.034 --> 33:16.995
<i>She goes, "Tommy, I didn't think</i>
<i>you'd ever do anything like this."</i>

33:48.652 --> 33:49.486
Featherstone: <i>Karl?</i>

33:51.488 --> 33:54.824
<i>During the period of time</i>
<i>that we've interviewed you, today...</i>

33:55.742 --> 33:58.453
<i>Once again, I'd like to ask you,</i>
<i>have we threatened you or...</i>

33:58.912 --> 34:00.789
<i>No.</i>
<i>-...promised you anything?</i>

34:01.081 --> 34:03.708
<i>You're making this of your own free will,</i>
<i>this statement?</i>

34:03.792 --> 34:06.211
<i>It was of my own free will</i>
<i>to get this recorded.</i>

34:08.672 --> 34:11.591
<i>Have you been allowed to smoke, drink,</i>

34:12.217 --> 34:13.552
<i>drink Cokes...</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

34:13.677 --> 34:14.928
<i>...anything that you wanted?</i>

34:15.136 --> 34:18.265
<i>Yes, I was served</i>
<i>right during the meeting.</i>

34:19.140 --> 34:20.976
<i>Once again, Tommy, I want to reiterate,</i>

34:21.434 --> 34:23.562
<i>you're giving this statement</i>
<i>of your own free will?</i>

34:23.645 --> 34:24.479
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

34:25.480 --> 34:28.942
<i>Is there anything else that you'd like</i>
<i>to add, to this tape recording,</i>

34:29.025 --> 34:30.527
<i>prior to us shutting it off?</i>

34:31.903 --> 34:33.154
<i>I knew, if...</i>

34:33.863 --> 34:36.157
<i>I knew I wouldn't have done it</i>
<i>if I wasn't drunk,</i>

34:36.241 --> 34:38.159
<i>'cause I thought it was just a dream.</i>

39:41.254 --> 39:43.798
<i>Like I said, I saw her periodically.</i>

39:43.882 --> 39:46.342
<i>I didn't recognize her when she came out.</i>

39:46.426 --> 39:48.803
<i>But after I got in the store</i>
<i>and nobody was there, I said,</i>

39:48.887 --> 39:51.472
<i>"That girl that just left</i>
<i>is the girl that works here."</i>

39:51.806 --> 39:53.057
<i>I told my nephews that.</i>

39:53.141 --> 39:53.975
<i>No, I know.</i>

39:54.058 --> 39:57.061
<i>There's no doubt in my mind</i>
<i>that she was taken.</i>

39:58.229 --> 39:59.272
<i>As we arrived.</i>

40:41.105 --> 40:43.107
<i>"Question: 'Would you tell this jury</i>
<i>what he said?'</i>

40:43.191 --> 40:46.110
<i>Answer:</i>
<i>'He said that Odell raped her first</i>

40:46.194 --> 40:47.487
<i>and then it was Tommy's turn.</i>

40:47.570 --> 40:50.198
<i>He bit her on the breast</i>
<i>and cut her down the arm.</i>

40:50.281 --> 40:53.451
<i>And Odell killed her,</i>
<i>stabbed her to death and killed her.</i>

40:53.534 --> 40:55.161
<i>And then Karl raped her.'</i>

40:55.244 --> 40:58.915
<i>Question: 'When he told you this statement</i>
<i>Terri, what was your reaction to that?'</i>

40:58.998 --> 41:00.375
<i>Answer: 'He scared me.'"</i>

41:10.093 --> 41:13.137
Featherstone: <i>You said earlier</i>
<i>that you noticed, when you came back up,</i>

41:13.221 --> 41:14.847
<i>a large amount of blood.</i>

41:14.931 --> 41:16.557
<i>Where all was she bleeding from?</i>

41:16.808 --> 41:18.101
<i>Mostly in her side.</i>

41:18.476 --> 41:20.019
<i>Where the deep cut was.</i>

41:20.103 --> 41:23.481
Featherstone: <i>And where else?</i>
<i>-In the side of her neck, right here.</i>

41:41.290 --> 41:46.004
Featherstone: <i>Was she conscious then?</i>
<i>-No. She wasn't very lively at all.</i>

41:46.087 --> 41:48.589
<i>How come?</i>
<i>-Because we'd all three raped her.</i>

41:49.340 --> 41:53.136
<i>I knew that she was dead</i>
<i>because she was white.</i>

41:54.262 --> 41:56.222
<i>We had to get rid of her and all,</i>

41:56.305 --> 41:58.725
<i>and he asked me a good place</i>
<i>to get rid of her.</i>

41:59.225 --> 42:03.271
<i>And I told him about a house,</i>
<i>and about this ditch down by the...</i>

42:04.939 --> 42:06.190
<i>Sandy River.</i>

42:06.274 --> 42:09.110
<i>And then he put her off</i>
<i>in the rotten place in the floor.</i>

42:09.444 --> 42:11.738
<i>Where was that?</i>
<i>-Over where the floor was missing.</i>

42:26.335 --> 42:28.713
Featherstone: <i>You poured gasoline on her?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

42:29.047 --> 42:32.800
<i>And then what? What did you do</i>
<i>after you poured the gas on her?</i>

42:34.218 --> 42:35.428
<i>We lit the house.</i>

42:36.345 --> 42:38.473
<i>We lit the gas</i>
<i>and burnt the house and her.</i>

45:13.669 --> 45:15.713
Featherstone:
<i>Are you confused about any of this today</i>

45:15.796 --> 45:17.423
<i>or do you understand what's going on?</i>

45:17.506 --> 45:19.425
<i>Yes, I understand what's going on.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

45:19.508 --> 45:21.469
<i>You understand</i>
<i>how serious this investigation is?</i>

45:21.552 --> 45:23.346
<i>Yes, I do.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

45:25.014 --> 45:27.308
<i>We'll end the tape at this time.</i>

45:28.142 --> 45:31.479
<i>I've got 7:29 p.m.</i>

45:33.064 --> 45:34.649
<i>And we'll conclude the tape now.</i>

45:34.815 --> 45:36.192
<i>Still present in the room...</i>

45:36.776 --> 45:39.695
<i>Deputy Inspector Rusty Featherstone,</i>
<i>Special Agent Gary Rogers,</i>

45:39.779 --> 45:41.822
<i>Captain Dennis Smith,</i>
<i>and Agent Dee Cordray,</i>

45:41.906 --> 45:43.616
<i>as well as Tommy Ward.</i>
