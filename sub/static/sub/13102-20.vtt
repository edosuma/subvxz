00:01.667 --> 00:03.750
[instrumental music]

00:06.208 --> 00:07.875
Look, I don't care what
it says on your system.

00:07.958 --> 00:09.542
That's a perfectly
valid passport.

00:09.625 --> 00:11.792
- If you'd just listen--
- What's the problem here?

00:11.875 --> 00:14.208
- Who are you?
- Security Chief Zack Allan.

00:14.292 --> 00:16.083
- Who are you?
- Theresa Halloran.

00:16.167 --> 00:18.375
This isn't an Earth Alliance
sanctioned passport.

00:18.458 --> 00:19.750
I know that.

00:19.833 --> 00:21.250
Look, Mr. Allan

00:21.333 --> 00:22.583
I'm a duly elected member

00:22.667 --> 00:24.292
of the Mars
provisional government.

00:24.375 --> 00:26.208
Under the terms of the
new treaty we're authorized

00:26.292 --> 00:29.583
to produce our own passports,
Identi-cards, and currency.

00:29.667 --> 00:30.833
It's not my fault that Earth

00:30.917 --> 00:32.875
isn't recognizing
that in practice.

00:32.958 --> 00:34.417
'They're holding off
putting our data'

00:34.500 --> 00:36.500
'into the system
as a form of harassment,'

00:36.583 --> 00:39.458
'pressuring Martian citizens
into using Earth documentation'

00:39.542 --> 00:41.250
because it isn't
worth the hassle.

00:41.333 --> 00:43.125
Well, I have no intention
of putting up

00:43.208 --> 00:44.792
with bureaucratic blackmail.

00:44.875 --> 00:46.458
If you have a problem
with the passport

00:46.542 --> 00:48.125
take it up
with someone who cares.

00:48.208 --> 00:50.125
Uh, that would be me.

00:50.208 --> 00:53.000
Doc, you know this...lady?

00:54.000 --> 00:56.625
Well, I can vouch for her, uh..

00:56.708 --> 00:59.792
She, uh, worked with
the resistance back on Mars

00:59.875 --> 01:01.417
helped bust Sheridan
out of jail

01:01.500 --> 01:03.792
and coordinated the attacks
on President Clark's bases

01:03.875 --> 01:05.875
that allowed us to free Earth.

01:05.958 --> 01:07.417
She's okay.

01:07.500 --> 01:10.542
Alright. If you say so.

01:10.625 --> 01:13.542
Download the station regs
once you find a place to stay.

01:13.625 --> 01:15.125
I have a hunch you'll need 'em.

01:15.208 --> 01:17.833
[indistinct chatter on PA]

01:18.875 --> 01:21.375
- Thanks.
- Hey, no problem.

01:21.458 --> 01:25.833
Just, uh, just a good thing
I happened to be passing by.

01:25.917 --> 01:27.625
I would have kept my eye out
for your name

01:27.708 --> 01:29.667
on the incoming transport
but, uh..

01:31.000 --> 01:33.167
...you haven't told me
what it was.

01:33.250 --> 01:35.208
It wasn't that kind
of a world, Stephen.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.667
So, what brings you
to Babylon 5?

01:40.750 --> 01:42.167
Well, I'm looking
for Michael Garibaldi.

01:42.250 --> 01:44.875
- Is he still around?
- Yeah, he's still here.

01:44.958 --> 01:46.667
Is he okay?

01:46.750 --> 01:48.792
Well, yeah, yeah,
he's had some problems lately

01:48.875 --> 01:51.833
but he's doing
much better now, why?

01:51.917 --> 01:54.292
[Michael retching]

01:56.167 --> 01:58.500
Damn, when is this
gonna stop, Lise?

01:58.583 --> 02:00.000
(Lise)
'When you finish detoxing'

02:00.083 --> 02:02.250
'and get all that alcohol
out of your system.'

02:02.333 --> 02:04.792
You should know the routine.
You've been through it enough.

02:04.875 --> 02:06.875
I know, I know

02:06.958 --> 02:09.458
I keep asking the
same question every..

02:09.542 --> 02:11.083
[door chimes]

02:14.500 --> 02:16.083
Yes?

02:16.167 --> 02:18.167
Hi, Stephen, Come on in.

02:18.250 --> 02:21.375
Lise, this is number, uh..

02:21.458 --> 02:23.708
- Tessa Halloran, this is Lise.
- Hello.

02:23.792 --> 02:25.000
Is Michael in?

02:25.083 --> 02:26.208
[Michael retching]

02:26.292 --> 02:28.042
[Michael coughing]

02:29.792 --> 02:31.458
(Michael)
'Ah, I feel like
I have just thrown up'

02:31.542 --> 02:34.417
'everything I've eaten
in the last 12 years.'

02:34.500 --> 02:36.167
He's here.

02:36.250 --> 02:38.625
Michael, company.

02:43.083 --> 02:44.417
[clears throat]

02:46.208 --> 02:48.250
Stephen, what..

02:48.333 --> 02:51.875
Hey, you're a long way
from home.

02:51.958 --> 02:54.750
I know, but I wanted
to give you the news myself.

02:54.833 --> 02:56.250
What news?

02:56.333 --> 02:57.833
In the next couple of days

02:57.917 --> 02:59.792
someone's going to try
to kill you.

03:01.333 --> 03:03.000
Both of you.

03:03.083 --> 03:04.875
[dramatic music]

03:07.333 --> 03:08.917
(Kosh)
And so it begins..

03:09.000 --> 03:11.250
- There is a hole in your mind.
- What do you want?

03:11.333 --> 03:12.375
(G'kar)
No one here

03:12.458 --> 03:13.833
is exactly what he appears.

03:13.917 --> 03:15.833
(Sinclair)
Nothing's the same anymore.

03:15.917 --> 03:17.417
(General Hague)
Commander Sinclair
is being reassigned.

03:17.500 --> 03:18.500
(Londo)
Why don't you eliminate

03:18.583 --> 03:19.750
the entire Narn homeworld?

03:19.833 --> 03:21.167
(Elric)
I see a great hand

03:21.250 --> 03:23.292
reaching out of the star.

03:23.375 --> 03:26.000
(ISN reporter)
President Clark has signed
a decree today declaring--

03:26.083 --> 03:28.167
(Sheridan)
These orders have forced us
to declare independence.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.958
Unless your people get off

03:30.042 --> 03:31.833
their encounter suited butts
and do something.

03:31.917 --> 03:33.792
(Zathras)
You are the one who was.

03:33.875 --> 03:36.458
(Kosh)
If you go to Z'ha'dum,
you will die.

03:36.542 --> 03:39.958
(Lorien)
Why are you here, do you've
anything worth living for?

03:40.042 --> 03:42.375
(Delenn)
I think of my beautiful
city in flames.

03:42.458 --> 03:44.375
(Sheridan)
Now, get the hell
out of our galaxy!

03:44.458 --> 03:47.542
We are here to place
President Clark under arrest.

03:47.625 --> 03:50.667
[theme music]

04:20.583 --> 04:23.667
[music continues]

04:35.792 --> 04:37.875
[instrumental music]

04:41.917 --> 04:44.167
So within days of Mars
declaring independence

04:44.250 --> 04:46.250
every major corporation
with ties to Earth

04:46.333 --> 04:47.958
was running for cover.

04:48.042 --> 04:50.000
They'd been exploiting
and strip mining Mars

04:50.083 --> 04:52.250
for decades so they were scared

04:52.333 --> 04:55.542
covering their tracks
as fast as possible.

04:55.625 --> 04:57.208
It got so bad that
in parts of Dome One

04:57.292 --> 05:00.708
you couldn't buy a paper
shredder for love or money.

05:00.792 --> 05:03.250
So what does this have to do
with Lise and me?

05:03.333 --> 05:04.750
Well, after forming
the provisional government

05:04.833 --> 05:06.750
we went after their records.

05:06.833 --> 05:10.792
Offered immunity to anyone who
would come forth and help us.

05:10.875 --> 05:13.083
Along the way,
we developed sources inside

05:13.167 --> 05:16.875
most of the major corporations
still working on Mars.

05:16.958 --> 05:19.208
Corporations like yours,
Ms. Edgars.

05:19.292 --> 05:20.583
But I haven't
done anything wrong.

05:20.667 --> 05:22.042
(Tessa)
'No one's saying you did'

05:22.125 --> 05:23.417
but with the death
of your husband

05:23.500 --> 05:24.875
you now own one of
the 10 biggest

05:24.958 --> 05:27.167
medical research
companies on Mars.

05:27.250 --> 05:30.000
It's a company that financed
several black projects

05:30.083 --> 05:31.458
under President Clark's
administration.

05:31.542 --> 05:33.583
Now, we know about
the telepath virus

05:33.667 --> 05:35.125
he was working on, but who knows

05:35.208 --> 05:36.833
what else they were
cooking up for the government.

05:36.917 --> 05:38.833
William didn't bring me
into any of that.

05:38.917 --> 05:41.458
He deliberately
kept me out of it.

05:41.542 --> 05:42.583
And now that she's in charge

05:42.667 --> 05:43.917
they're afraid
she's gonna find out

05:44.000 --> 05:45.167
something she shouldn't know.

05:45.250 --> 05:47.042
Is that what
your source told you?

05:47.125 --> 05:48.417
And because
you're the sort of person

05:48.500 --> 05:50.750
who could help her
expose their activities

05:50.833 --> 05:52.167
they want you gone as well.

05:52.250 --> 05:55.458
Great, did they say
who was gonna do the job?

05:55.542 --> 05:57.333
No. All he knew was that

05:57.417 --> 05:59.250
the hit would be going down
in the next couple of days.

05:59.333 --> 06:00.542
My guess is they want it done

06:00.625 --> 06:02.500
before the two of you
leave for Mars.

06:02.583 --> 06:04.667
Two of you?

06:04.750 --> 06:07.583
Michael, is there something else
you'd like to share with us?

06:10.667 --> 06:13.208
[intense music]

06:14.417 --> 06:15.833
(male #1)
'There he is!'

06:15.917 --> 06:18.292
(all)
G'kar, G'kar, G'kar!

06:18.375 --> 06:20.958
G'kar, Citizen G'kar, over here!

06:21.042 --> 06:22.542
If I could just..

06:22.625 --> 06:24.167
Citizen G'kar!

06:24.250 --> 06:27.292
[all shouting]

06:31.625 --> 06:34.667
[door buzzes]

06:39.208 --> 06:41.625
- Hello, Lyta.
- G'kar.

06:41.708 --> 06:43.750
Do you mind if I talk to you?

06:43.833 --> 06:46.458
You'll forgive
the accommodations.

06:46.542 --> 06:47.917
It's a cell.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.875
I've gotten used to them.

06:49.958 --> 06:51.792
Frankly, I've done some
of my best writing

06:51.875 --> 06:53.125
in places like this.

06:53.208 --> 06:55.583
In here, you cannot
run from yourself.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.125
I assume they told you
about my offer.

07:00.542 --> 07:01.875
Yes.

07:01.958 --> 07:03.042
Makes sense.

07:04.583 --> 07:07.833
'Cause of my growing abilities,
I can't go home.

07:07.917 --> 07:12.083
I can't stay here.
So, I may as well go with you.

07:14.708 --> 07:16.833
It's ironic.

07:16.917 --> 07:18.458
[chuckles]

07:18.542 --> 07:21.583
You have to leave because
everybody wants you.

07:21.667 --> 07:23.500
They're fighting over you.

07:24.583 --> 07:26.417
And I have to leave because..

07:26.500 --> 07:28.667
...nobody wants me.

07:28.750 --> 07:32.500
And yet we are the same,
in many ways.

07:32.583 --> 07:35.667
We are all the sum
of our tears.

07:35.750 --> 07:38.500
Too little, and the ground
is not fertile

07:38.583 --> 07:40.708
and nothing can grow there.

07:40.792 --> 07:45.208
Too much, the best of us
is washed away.

07:45.292 --> 07:49.042
My rains have come
and gone, for now.

07:49.125 --> 07:50.708
Yours are just beginning.

07:52.417 --> 07:54.750
So, any idea where we'll go?

07:54.833 --> 07:57.667
No, that's what
makes it so exciting.

07:57.750 --> 07:58.875
[laughs]

07:58.958 --> 08:01.750
I don't think I'd choose
that word for it, but..

08:01.833 --> 08:04.125
...beats being stuck here.

08:04.208 --> 08:06.375
So I appreciate the offer..

08:06.458 --> 08:10.208
...even though I know this
isn't entirely for my benefit.

08:10.292 --> 08:11.667
I don't know what you're--

08:11.750 --> 08:14.833
G'kar, come on.

08:14.917 --> 08:18.625
I'm essential to your getting
your hands on telepath DNA.

08:18.708 --> 08:21.042
You've a vested interest
in staying close to me.

08:22.667 --> 08:25.375
That's why you think
I'm doing this..

08:25.458 --> 08:28.000
...just that,
my own personal interest?

08:28.083 --> 08:29.750
Well..

08:29.833 --> 08:31.833
...yeah.

08:31.917 --> 08:35.583
Then my decision was even more
correct than I had imagined.

08:35.667 --> 08:38.583
I'll see to it that
your belongings are transferred

08:38.667 --> 08:41.250
to my ship
when we are ready to leave.

08:41.333 --> 08:43.167
Meanwhile..

08:43.250 --> 08:45.792
...consider
the walls around you.

08:45.875 --> 08:48.125
In a little while,
we will leave these behind.

08:49.667 --> 08:51.458
Now you have to decide
how many others

08:51.542 --> 08:53.833
you will bring with you
when we leave.

09:05.708 --> 09:07.625
I think we have
a handle on your problem.

09:09.208 --> 09:10.792
Because we don't know
who was sent

09:10.875 --> 09:12.583
to kill you or where they are

09:12.667 --> 09:15.875
we can't protect you
as long as you're exposed

09:15.958 --> 09:18.958
so the first step
is to limit your exposure.

09:19.042 --> 09:20.125
You and Lise

09:20.208 --> 09:21.583
will move into
unregistered quarters.

09:21.667 --> 09:22.875
We'll keep them off the logs.

09:22.958 --> 09:24.750
Nobody will know about it
but the four of us.

09:24.833 --> 09:27.042
Alright, that's fine,
but I can't hide forever.

09:27.125 --> 09:28.458
No, you won't have to.

09:28.542 --> 09:31.333
Zack's gonna find G'kar
and see if he's up for part two.

09:33.250 --> 09:36.333
We will stage an elaborate
going away ceremony for G'kar.

09:36.417 --> 09:38.792
Everyone will be there,
Including you.

09:38.875 --> 09:42.458
Now, by making sure that
he has only one shot at you

09:42.542 --> 09:45.542
we'll force him to take it there
in a controlled situation.

09:45.625 --> 09:47.833
Zack will have the place
crawling with security.

09:47.917 --> 09:50.917
The second he moves,
we'll take him down.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.417
Hmm.

09:52.500 --> 09:55.333
Uh, Zack came up
with, uh, all this?

09:55.417 --> 09:56.792
You taught him well.

09:56.875 --> 09:58.792
I guess so.

09:58.875 --> 10:00.750
Hmm, who would
have figured, huh?

10:02.458 --> 10:04.667
So, uh..

10:04.750 --> 10:07.875
...Stephen tells me
you're leaving, too.

10:07.958 --> 10:09.042
Yeah, uh..

10:09.125 --> 10:11.583
Lise and I..

10:11.667 --> 10:13.333
...are getting married.

10:14.875 --> 10:16.792
Are you sure you aren't
rushing into things?

10:16.875 --> 10:19.000
[chuckles]
Rushing things, huh

10:19.083 --> 10:20.375
uh, we've known each other,
on and off

10:20.458 --> 10:22.125
for something like 15 years.

10:22.208 --> 10:24.000
You know, we break up,
we get back together.

10:24.083 --> 10:26.667
We break up, we get back
together, and..

10:26.750 --> 10:29.958
...I think we finally
got a chance at makin' it right.

10:30.042 --> 10:31.042
And the job?

10:31.125 --> 10:32.667
Oh, come on, don't kid a kidder.

10:32.750 --> 10:34.542
We both know
I'm not gettin' my job back

10:34.625 --> 10:36.417
not after everything
that's happened.

10:38.167 --> 10:41.042
Well, you better get settled
in your new quarters.

10:41.125 --> 10:42.625
Leave the rest to us.

10:42.708 --> 10:44.375
You've been taking care
of everybody

10:44.458 --> 10:46.250
since you've been here.

10:46.333 --> 10:48.792
Let us take care of you
for a change, huh?

10:52.042 --> 10:54.958
Whoa, whoa! Hold the door.

10:55.042 --> 10:56.625
Oh, thanks.

10:56.708 --> 10:58.208
It's kind of
a bad area down here.

10:58.292 --> 11:00.375
I didn't want
to wait around too long.

11:00.458 --> 11:02.667
Anyway, thanks.

11:02.750 --> 11:04.250
That's the thing
about these transport tubes.

11:04.333 --> 11:06.125
You know, you never know
if you're gonna get the car

11:06.208 --> 11:08.417
or you're just
gonna get the shaft.

11:08.500 --> 11:11.292
[grunting]

11:16.167 --> 11:17.792
[sighs]

11:17.875 --> 11:19.458
Sorry, buddy.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.458
But I need..

11:28.458 --> 11:30.500
...what you got.

11:31.583 --> 11:34.625
[dramatic music]

11:41.000 --> 11:42.333
(male #2)
'The body was found
in Transport Tube 6.'

11:44.417 --> 11:45.708
Well?

11:45.792 --> 11:47.833
Pending a full autopsy,
looks like one clean stab wound

11:47.917 --> 11:50.542
where it'd do the most damage
in the least amount of time.

11:50.625 --> 11:52.125
No other signs of violence
so he was taken

11:52.208 --> 11:54.292
completely by surprise.

11:54.375 --> 11:56.333
I don't get it.

11:56.417 --> 11:58.083
As far as we can tell,
he wasn't robbed.

11:58.167 --> 12:00.625
He didn't break up any fights.
He was a new guy.

12:00.708 --> 12:02.958
He wasn't here long enough
to honk anybody off.

12:03.042 --> 12:04.458
Well, maybe,
it was a random attack.

12:04.542 --> 12:06.250
I don't believe
in random attacks.

12:06.333 --> 12:07.917
Maybe there's not
an obvious reason

12:08.000 --> 12:09.625
but there's always a reason.

12:09.708 --> 12:12.042
Besides, if you're gonna
knock off somebody for fun

12:12.125 --> 12:14.292
you're not gonna take on
an armed peace officer.

12:14.375 --> 12:16.792
Whoever did this
was a professional.

12:16.875 --> 12:18.792
Okay, then why was he killed?

12:18.875 --> 12:20.042
I don't know

12:20.125 --> 12:21.917
but I'm gonna figure it out.

12:24.250 --> 12:27.292
[zapping]

12:39.208 --> 12:40.292
[beeps]

12:43.417 --> 12:45.875
Access security channels.

12:45.958 --> 12:48.792
(automated voice)
'Unable to respond.
System locked.'

12:48.875 --> 12:52.500
'DNA identification sequence
does not match.'

12:57.667 --> 13:00.708
[zapping]

13:03.083 --> 13:04.500
So, I appreciate
your taking the time

13:04.583 --> 13:05.750
to see me, Mr. President.

13:05.833 --> 13:07.583
Well, it's the least I can do.

13:07.667 --> 13:09.083
How are things on Mars?

13:10.750 --> 13:12.125
We've had nothing
but trouble with Earth

13:12.208 --> 13:14.417
since we became independent.

13:14.500 --> 13:16.708
They're treating us
as if we were still a colony.

13:16.792 --> 13:19.042
Everything has to go
through Earth.

13:19.125 --> 13:22.333
Supplies, money transfers,
documents.

13:22.417 --> 13:24.083
They couldn't kill us
with bullets

13:24.167 --> 13:26.375
so they're drowning us
in red tape.

13:26.458 --> 13:28.375
Frankly, I preferred
the bullets.

13:28.458 --> 13:29.917
At least there,
I could shoot back.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.375
Well, that's the problem

13:31.458 --> 13:34.375
when you go from being
a soldier to a politician.

13:34.458 --> 13:35.833
You have to sit
and listen to people

13:35.917 --> 13:38.417
you would've shot
six months earlier.

13:38.500 --> 13:39.708
When we were fighting
for independence

13:39.792 --> 13:40.958
we were able to put our internal

13:41.042 --> 13:42.708
disagreements
on the back burner.

13:42.792 --> 13:45.042
Now, they're all coming out,

13:45.125 --> 13:46.875
and we've had some violence.

13:46.958 --> 13:48.542
Well, historically,
wars of independence

13:48.625 --> 13:51.458
have almost always been
followed by civil wars.

13:51.542 --> 13:54.542
I think that's
what Earth wants.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.792
To put pressure on us so
we're fighting among ourselves

13:56.875 --> 13:58.750
so they can come riding in
on a white horse

13:58.833 --> 14:00.958
stop the fighting,
restore order

14:01.042 --> 14:04.750
put their own people in charge
for the general good.

14:04.833 --> 14:07.250
We'll be right back
where we started.

14:07.333 --> 14:08.500
What are your options?

14:09.458 --> 14:11.458
Doing what I'm doing right now.

14:13.125 --> 14:14.583
Expanding my contacts
as much as I can.

14:14.667 --> 14:15.917
If something's gonna blow up

14:16.000 --> 14:18.375
I wanna know about it
before it happens.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.083
Well, I'll tell you what.

14:20.167 --> 14:21.792
Whatever Earth says

14:21.875 --> 14:24.625
the Alliance recognizes
the independence of Mars.

14:26.250 --> 14:29.333
You could set up
a diplomatic office on Minbar.

14:29.417 --> 14:30.917
We could help you
establish an account

14:31.000 --> 14:32.750
outside of Earth's jurisdiction.

14:32.833 --> 14:35.542
It would be a big help..

14:35.625 --> 14:37.250
...Mr. President.

14:37.333 --> 14:40.417
It would mean a lot
to the folks back home.

14:40.500 --> 14:43.958
There is one thing I would
like from you in return.

14:44.042 --> 14:46.292
Wait a few days before
heading back to Mars.

14:47.875 --> 14:49.375
Why?

14:49.458 --> 14:51.208
I'd rather not say yet.

14:51.292 --> 14:53.333
I need some more time
to think it over

14:53.417 --> 14:55.833
but I've had an idea..

14:55.917 --> 14:58.042
...and you know how dangerous
that can be.

14:59.708 --> 15:02.958
(automated voice)
'Unable to respond,
system blocked.'

15:03.042 --> 15:04.625
'DNA system. Unable..'

15:04.708 --> 15:06.458
'Identification sequence..'

15:06.542 --> 15:08.792
'Unable to respond.
System blocked.'

15:08.875 --> 15:10.667
'Identification sequence
does not..'

15:10.750 --> 15:11.792
[beeps]

15:12.958 --> 15:15.500
[intense music]

15:18.750 --> 15:21.042
Access security channel.

15:21.125 --> 15:23.708
[indistinct chatter]

15:23.792 --> 15:25.125
[beeps]

15:33.958 --> 15:35.083
[beeps]

15:35.167 --> 15:37.125
[indistinct chatter]

15:39.750 --> 15:41.917
A bit more. That's-that's good.

15:43.083 --> 15:44.417
'Yeah, you're in,
I'll tell you when.'

15:44.917 --> 15:45.917
'Okay.'

15:46.000 --> 15:47.417
'A little bit high
on the right.'

15:50.333 --> 15:51.833
[sighs]

15:54.083 --> 15:55.875
They say you are leaving.

15:55.958 --> 15:58.208
- Yes.
- You can't do that.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.708
You are an important figure
to our people.

16:01.792 --> 16:04.875
You have an obligation
to either stay here and teach

16:04.958 --> 16:06.708
or return home and lead.

16:06.792 --> 16:10.208
My obligation is to do
what I believe is right.

16:10.292 --> 16:12.375
If that means leaving,
then I will leave.

16:12.458 --> 16:14.292
No. You don't understand.

16:15.625 --> 16:19.250
I spent all my money
to come here..

16:19.333 --> 16:22.750
...to sit at your feet
and learn from you.

16:22.833 --> 16:25.667
There's nothing you can learn
from my feet.

16:25.750 --> 16:28.125
And I am not responsible
for your choices.

16:28.208 --> 16:31.542
We put you in
this position, G'kar.

16:31.625 --> 16:34.542
Our reverence
is our gift to you

16:34.625 --> 16:38.833
and you are responsible to us.
You owe us.

16:38.917 --> 16:42.125
Without us, you are nothing.

16:43.500 --> 16:46.417
Then I am nothing.
Good day.

16:46.500 --> 16:49.208
But I made these for you.

16:49.292 --> 16:52.292
You made these?

16:52.375 --> 16:55.417
You are the one
who has been selling these?

16:55.500 --> 16:59.292
Yes, it has been my way
of honoring you.

16:59.375 --> 17:01.917
[intense music]

17:06.833 --> 17:08.125
Go home.

17:09.375 --> 17:11.958
Don't. Don't tell me
to go home.

17:12.042 --> 17:14.875
Don't turn your
back on me, G'kar!

17:14.958 --> 17:16.292
G'kar..

17:17.750 --> 17:19.167
You wanted to see me?

17:19.250 --> 17:20.708
Yeah, I've got the guard's
personal effects.

17:20.792 --> 17:22.417
I thought you might want to send
them on to his family.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.583
Thanks, I'll take care of it.

17:25.667 --> 17:27.292
You got anything else
on the cause of death

17:27.375 --> 17:28.958
that might give us a perp?

17:29.042 --> 17:31.375
- No, anything on your end?
- Zip.

17:31.458 --> 17:32.708
I haven't been able
to give it the time

17:32.792 --> 17:34.458
I'd like to
because we're up to our ears

17:34.542 --> 17:36.667
looking for the hit man
that's after Garibaldi.

17:36.750 --> 17:39.750
And there's less than
eight hours until the ceremony.

17:39.833 --> 17:41.625
I'll have my people there
in plain clothes

17:41.708 --> 17:43.958
but that's the best we can do.

17:44.042 --> 17:45.792
We still don't know who he is

17:45.875 --> 17:47.667
or how to stop him or..

17:51.208 --> 17:53.250
- Doc.
- 'Yeah?'

17:53.333 --> 17:55.792
Any of your people
do anything to this link?

17:57.042 --> 17:59.792
No, not that I know of. Why?

17:59.875 --> 18:01.458
Uh, it was stuck
to the bottom of the box.

18:01.542 --> 18:04.542
It's got some kind
of adhesive on it.

18:04.625 --> 18:07.250
That's odd.
Links don't use adhesive.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.417
It's a molecular
bonding material

18:09.500 --> 18:10.875
genetically coded
to the owner.

18:10.958 --> 18:12.833
Exactly.

18:12.917 --> 18:16.917
Whoever killed him took his
and substituted this.

18:18.417 --> 18:21.167
Which means he has access
to all the security channels.

18:21.250 --> 18:22.833
Which is exactly
the kind of information

18:22.917 --> 18:25.000
a pro would need to pull off
a hit and get away alive.

18:25.083 --> 18:26.875
- I gotta go.
- Yeah.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.542
[intense music]

18:35.375 --> 18:36.333
[beeps]

18:36.417 --> 18:37.917
[indistinct chatter on link]

18:39.667 --> 18:43.000
[crowd chanting]
G'kar, G'kar, G'kar..

18:59.333 --> 19:01.250
[music continues]

19:01.333 --> 19:04.375
[crowd cheering]

19:14.708 --> 19:16.083
Thank you.

19:16.167 --> 19:19.000
Thank you, thank you, very much.

19:19.083 --> 19:20.542
With ambassador Delenn on Minbar

19:20.625 --> 19:23.833
overseeing the completion
of the new Alliance facilities.

19:23.917 --> 19:25.250
'It falls to me'

19:25.333 --> 19:28.958
to single out two individuals
for appreciation.

19:29.042 --> 19:32.458
One...Michael Garibaldi.

19:32.542 --> 19:35.333
'Who has served Babylon 5
with distinction'

19:35.417 --> 19:37.083
for six years.

19:37.167 --> 19:38.875
The other..

19:38.958 --> 19:40.792
...Ambassador G'kar of Narn.

19:40.875 --> 19:42.458
[crowd cheers]

19:44.458 --> 19:48.708
I have had the distinct
honor and pleasure

19:48.792 --> 19:50.917
to serve alongside both of them.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.250
And now that they are
leaving Babylon 5

19:53.333 --> 19:56.208
to pursue other goals.

19:56.292 --> 19:58.208
I think it only proper

19:58.292 --> 20:00.583
to give them a going away party.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.208
[crowd cheering]

20:02.292 --> 20:03.917
Ambassador.

20:06.167 --> 20:07.083
[beeps]

20:07.167 --> 20:08.708
Open secure channel.

20:08.792 --> 20:10.083
Station house

20:10.167 --> 20:12.000
you got the ID on that
link programmed in?

20:12.083 --> 20:14.083
(male #3)
'Confirmed.'

20:14.167 --> 20:16.333
Alright, go in five seconds.

20:16.417 --> 20:20.458
Four, three, two, one.

20:20.542 --> 20:23.583
[high-pitched frequency]

20:25.000 --> 20:26.167
Let's go, over here!

20:27.167 --> 20:29.125
[clamoring]

20:29.208 --> 20:30.750
(Zach)
'We got him!'

20:33.208 --> 20:36.000
G'kar, you are not worthy of us.

20:38.417 --> 20:39.583
[grunts]

20:40.708 --> 20:42.208
[zapping]

20:43.750 --> 20:45.417
Lise.

20:46.792 --> 20:49.583
[indistinct chatter]

20:54.000 --> 20:56.167
How is she?

20:56.250 --> 20:57.542
I don't know.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.542
We're not gonna know
for a while.

21:00.625 --> 21:02.167
I'm sorry for what happened.

21:02.250 --> 21:03.375
If I could go back in time

21:03.458 --> 21:05.542
and let the bullet
strike me instead of her

21:05.625 --> 21:07.208
I would do so.

21:07.292 --> 21:08.708
I know you would.

21:08.792 --> 21:11.000
It's not your fault, G'kar.

21:11.083 --> 21:12.458
We wouldn't have been up there
in the first place

21:12.542 --> 21:14.167
if it hadn't been
for that other guy.

21:14.250 --> 21:15.333
Mr. Allan has assured me

21:15.417 --> 21:16.750
that the Narn
who pulled the trigger

21:16.833 --> 21:19.500
will be prosecuted to
the fullest extent of the law.

21:19.583 --> 21:20.875
Now watch her BP.

21:22.667 --> 21:24.875
(Garibaldi)
'That's, uh, not gonna
do her very much good'

21:24.958 --> 21:26.625
right about now.

21:26.708 --> 21:28.917
Doc? How Is she?

21:29.000 --> 21:30.208
Well, it's just
too early to tell

21:30.292 --> 21:31.583
now, we've done
everything we can.

21:31.667 --> 21:33.958
Now it's up to her.
I'll let you know.

21:35.958 --> 21:38.125
She is strong.

21:38.208 --> 21:40.083
I know.

21:40.167 --> 21:42.458
I know she is.

21:42.542 --> 21:45.250
I know it feels as if there's
nothing you can do, but--

21:45.333 --> 21:46.750
No!

21:46.833 --> 21:49.708
No, there is definitely
something I can do.

21:49.792 --> 21:51.667
[dramatic music]

21:53.958 --> 21:56.375
Ah, Michael!
Michael, I wanted to talk to you

21:56.458 --> 21:58.042
about pressing charges
against the Narn.

21:58.125 --> 21:59.708
Forget that for now look, I want
five minutes with the guy

21:59.792 --> 22:00.875
who came here to kill
me and Lise.

22:00.958 --> 22:02.167
Now you know I can't do that.

22:02.250 --> 22:03.667
Yes, you can, now damn it, Zack,

22:03.750 --> 22:05.000
I haven't asked anything
from anybody around here.

22:05.083 --> 22:06.375
But now I'm asking,
and I'm gonna get it

22:06.458 --> 22:08.083
or I'm going straight
to the President.

22:08.167 --> 22:10.875
Now I give you my word, I will
not lay a finger on this guy.

22:10.958 --> 22:12.542
But you're gonna
give me five minutes

22:12.625 --> 22:14.042
or you're gonna have to shoot me

22:14.125 --> 22:16.167
because I'm going down there.

22:19.167 --> 22:20.792
[sighs]

22:26.417 --> 22:27.958
You can't do this to me!

22:28.042 --> 22:30.417
Oh, shut up and sit down!
I need a favor.

22:30.500 --> 22:32.792
I'm not in the mood. Besides,
It's not admissible in court.

22:32.875 --> 22:34.042
I don't care.
Look, we had a deal.

22:34.125 --> 22:35.417
You need me as much
as I need you.

22:35.500 --> 22:36.875
Now, either you climb
inside his head

22:36.958 --> 22:38.625
and tell me who hired him,
or the deal's off.

22:38.708 --> 22:40.458
The hell with you and
the hell with your little war

22:40.542 --> 22:41.917
against the Psi-Corps.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.125
Well, since you asked nicely.

22:44.208 --> 22:45.792
Look, you can't do this to me!

22:45.875 --> 22:48.125
I've got my rights. I..

22:50.375 --> 22:51.667
Alright, who sent you?

22:51.750 --> 22:53.917
Who hired you?

22:54.000 --> 22:55.750
He's actually fighting me.

22:55.833 --> 22:58.458
He's been trained
in countering probes.

22:58.542 --> 23:00.583
'He's singing songs'

23:00.667 --> 23:02.667
'doing math.'

23:02.750 --> 23:04.125
You forgot to carry the seven.

23:04.208 --> 23:06.583
- That's better.
- Push harder.

23:06.667 --> 23:09.875
Who hired you?

23:09.958 --> 23:12.125
Up, yours. Ahh!

23:12.208 --> 23:13.333
Oops, that was a mistake.

23:13.417 --> 23:15.583
By getting mad,
you distracted yourself

23:15.667 --> 23:16.875
from distracting yourself

23:16.958 --> 23:18.542
and I slipped in
through the back door.

23:18.625 --> 23:20.000
Ahh!

23:20.083 --> 23:21.625
Nighty night.

23:23.375 --> 23:24.792
'He's alive, but I fixed it'

23:24.875 --> 23:26.542
'so he won't remember
any of this.'

23:26.625 --> 23:28.750
- Who sent him? Who hired him?
- The board.

23:28.833 --> 23:30.750
Board. I figured
it had to be somebody

23:30.833 --> 23:32.292
on the board of directors
of Edgars industries.

23:32.375 --> 23:33.958
What I need to know
is which one.

23:34.042 --> 23:36.958
Not one, all of them,
that was the deal.

23:37.042 --> 23:38.250
They all had to agree

23:38.333 --> 23:40.750
and back each other up
in case things back-fired.

23:40.833 --> 23:42.333
Of course, there's nothing you
can do about it.

23:42.417 --> 23:43.750
There's no proof.

23:43.833 --> 23:46.417
You just leave that to me.
Thanks, Lyta. Oh, uh..

23:46.500 --> 23:47.750
I'm not sure if I'm gonna
get to see you

23:47.833 --> 23:49.125
before you take off, but..

23:49.208 --> 23:50.875
Just remember
our bargain, Michael.

23:50.958 --> 23:54.167
Help me create a force I can
use against the Psi-Corps

23:54.250 --> 23:56.833
and I'll give you the chance
to strike back at Bester.

23:56.917 --> 23:58.583
If you don't pull that off
in two years

23:58.667 --> 24:00.792
when I come back
this way again..

24:00.875 --> 24:02.042
Well..

24:02.125 --> 24:04.833
...consider that a sign
of things to come.

24:23.417 --> 24:25.292
[doorbell chiming]

24:25.375 --> 24:26.375
Yes?

24:26.458 --> 24:29.542
[indistinct chatter]

24:31.125 --> 24:32.625
Mr. President.

24:32.708 --> 24:34.333
What can I do for you?

24:34.417 --> 24:36.000
Uh, nothing, nothing.

24:36.083 --> 24:38.208
Uh, I just wanted to come by and

24:38.292 --> 24:39.667
see you before you left.

24:39.750 --> 24:42.750
I was hoping you could stick
around a little bit longer

24:42.833 --> 24:45.583
until Delenn got back
from Minbar.

24:45.667 --> 24:47.583
She'd want to say goodbye.

24:47.667 --> 24:50.000
I'd hoped for the same thing.

24:50.083 --> 24:52.542
But, as recent events
have demonstrated

24:52.625 --> 24:53.958
my continued presence here

24:54.042 --> 24:56.083
will only cause
further disruption.

24:56.167 --> 24:58.083
Best to leave
as soon as possible.

25:00.292 --> 25:03.042
I've purchased a long-range
survey ship.

25:03.125 --> 25:05.542
Perfect for exploring.

25:05.625 --> 25:08.833
I'm told it can handle just
about any sort of environment

25:08.917 --> 25:11.792
and it only has
240 light years on it.

25:11.875 --> 25:13.583
Maybe you'd let me take it
for a spin

25:13.667 --> 25:14.875
around the block sometime.

25:14.958 --> 25:16.417
[both laughing]

25:18.292 --> 25:20.583
Uh, you know, G'kar, um..

25:22.542 --> 25:25.958
...what I said earlier
uh, at the podium..

25:28.042 --> 25:30.000
...I meant every word of that.

25:32.042 --> 25:34.583
You know, we-we've,
we've had our differences

25:34.667 --> 25:36.417
we've-we've yelled
at each other.

25:36.500 --> 25:38.500
I mean, there's been
more than a few times

25:38.583 --> 25:40.750
when I wanted to deck you.

25:43.083 --> 25:45.667
But when the day is done..

25:47.167 --> 25:49.958
...I've always had the greatest
respect for you.

25:52.458 --> 25:54.333
I'll miss you.

25:54.417 --> 25:57.125
Unnecessary.

25:57.208 --> 25:59.958
You see..

26:00.042 --> 26:03.125
I believe that when
we leave a place..

26:03.208 --> 26:07.333
..part of it goes with us
and part of us remains.

26:08.750 --> 26:11.542
Go anywhere in the station..

26:11.625 --> 26:14.250
...when it is quiet.

26:14.333 --> 26:16.750
And just listen.

26:16.833 --> 26:18.625
After a while,
you will hear the echoes

26:18.708 --> 26:21.125
of all our conversations

26:21.208 --> 26:24.000
every thought and word
we've exchanged.

26:27.417 --> 26:29.417
Long after we are gone..

26:31.500 --> 26:35.667
...our voices will linger
in these walls..

26:35.750 --> 26:38.750
...for as long as
this place remains.

26:40.750 --> 26:43.167
But I will admit..

26:43.250 --> 26:46.167
...that the part of me
that is going..

26:46.250 --> 26:49.458
...will very much miss
the part of you that is staying.

26:55.833 --> 26:58.417
You take care of yourself
out there, old friend.

26:58.500 --> 27:01.125
Maybe we'll meet up again
down the road a-ways, huh?

27:02.208 --> 27:03.500
Maybe so.

27:05.250 --> 27:06.542
Goodbye, John.

27:08.333 --> 27:09.708
Oh, you know what?

27:11.750 --> 27:15.375
That's the first time
that you've ever called me John.

27:15.458 --> 27:18.375
- No, it isn't.
- Oh, yes, it is.

27:18.458 --> 27:22.000
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is..

27:23.833 --> 27:25.208
[laughs]

27:25.292 --> 27:26.708
Goodbye, G'kar.

27:28.958 --> 27:31.250
[indistinct chatter]

27:31.333 --> 27:33.917
[instrumental music]

27:36.833 --> 27:38.000

27:38.083 --> 27:40.333
(automated voice)
'Babcomm unit online.'

27:41.625 --> 27:43.542
Computer,
I would like to dictate

27:43.625 --> 27:45.917
a message for later delivery.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.042
(automated voice)
'Stand by.'

27:48.125 --> 27:51.250
[indistinct chatter]

27:59.833 --> 28:01.333
Hey.

28:01.417 --> 28:03.750
Mm..

28:03.833 --> 28:06.583
Hey, yourself.

28:06.667 --> 28:07.875
How do you feel?

28:07.958 --> 28:09.917
Like I've been
sleeping for years.

28:11.500 --> 28:12.917
It's the painkillers.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.250
Doc said if you woke up,
though you'd be okay.

28:16.333 --> 28:18.250
Hurts like hell, though.

28:18.333 --> 28:19.917
Yeah.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.542
More painkillers?

28:21.625 --> 28:23.000
Definitely.

28:23.083 --> 28:25.708
I'll get somebody
to get them for ya.

28:25.792 --> 28:28.375
You know, having you in this
somewhat delusional state

28:28.458 --> 28:30.042
puts you in exactly
the right position

28:30.125 --> 28:32.000
for what I have in mind.

28:32.083 --> 28:34.917
Look, I've got a Minister
standing by down the hall.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.708
You are a Baptist, right?

28:36.792 --> 28:39.625
Yeah, first Baptist church

28:39.708 --> 28:41.458
of Mars reformed.

28:41.542 --> 28:42.792
That's it.

28:42.875 --> 28:44.125
But, Michael?

28:44.208 --> 28:45.833
What?

28:45.917 --> 28:47.625
You said I was
gonna be alright.

28:47.708 --> 28:49.667
Oh, you are.

28:49.750 --> 28:51.208
Oh, no, no, no.

28:51.292 --> 28:53.958
It's not last rites
or anything like that.

28:55.250 --> 28:57.417
Lise, I just thought that

28:57.500 --> 28:59.958
before the universe
threw us anything else..

29:02.167 --> 29:03.875
...that we should get married.

29:03.958 --> 29:07.292
I know that I don't have
a lot to offer you.

29:07.375 --> 29:09.292
I'm out of a job here..

29:09.375 --> 29:10.792
...I've got my problems and

29:10.875 --> 29:12.958
sometimes I can be
a real pain in the ass.

29:13.042 --> 29:15.000
[laughs]

29:15.083 --> 29:17.625
All I know is anything
that I've ever wanted

29:17.708 --> 29:19.333
I've never gotten.

29:19.417 --> 29:21.042
But I do know that the one thing

29:21.125 --> 29:23.958
that I want in this world
more than anything else..

29:25.208 --> 29:26.542
...is you.

29:26.625 --> 29:29.250
Alright, so it'll be
Lise Hampton Edgars Garibaldi

29:29.333 --> 29:32.125
and we'll never get all that put
on our bathrobes, but--

29:32.208 --> 29:33.667
Shh, shh, shh!

29:35.125 --> 29:38.083
Tell him to get his ass in here.

29:38.167 --> 29:39.583
Yeah?

29:39.667 --> 29:40.958
Yeah.

29:41.042 --> 29:42.583
Okay, alright.

29:42.667 --> 29:44.917
Look, don't move,
just stay right there, okay?

29:46.625 --> 29:50.125
Oh, hey, I'm gettin' married.

29:50.208 --> 29:51.417
[laughing]

29:53.875 --> 29:56.417
(male #4)
'Maintenance Chief Willis
to Cargo Bay 4.'

29:56.500 --> 29:58.333
'Chief Willis to Bay 4.'

30:01.667 --> 30:04.708
[door opens]

30:16.792 --> 30:18.417
Please remove that.

30:18.500 --> 30:20.875
As long as she's with me,
she's a free citizen

30:20.958 --> 30:22.542
and will not be restrained.

30:25.750 --> 30:27.375
Ahem!

30:31.500 --> 30:34.750
But if you could have
removed them at any time.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.583
It made everybody feel safer.

30:37.667 --> 30:41.583
Besides, I think I kind of
liked it after a while.

30:44.333 --> 30:46.167
Well..

30:50.333 --> 30:51.917
Well, anyway, uh..

30:53.833 --> 30:55.917
I suppose we should go.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.542
I suppose we should.

30:58.625 --> 31:00.250
I find I'm actually
looking forward

31:00.333 --> 31:04.292
to seeing the universe
with you alongside, Lyta.

31:04.375 --> 31:06.625
'Perhaps we'll find
something extraordinary.'

31:08.083 --> 31:11.833
Perhaps something
extraordinary will find us.

31:11.917 --> 31:15.542
Either way, it's going
to be quite an adventure.

31:15.625 --> 31:18.458
I smell another book coming.

31:18.542 --> 31:20.625
What a wonderful idea.

31:22.250 --> 31:23.542

[instrumental music]

31:59.958 --> 32:02.250
[indistinct chatter]

32:02.333 --> 32:03.833
Yes?

32:03.917 --> 32:06.333
(female #1)
'He's on the line
and waiting for you.'

32:06.417 --> 32:07.750
Alright.

32:09.250 --> 32:10.542
[sighs]

32:11.875 --> 32:14.875
Good evening, Mr. Garibaldi.

32:14.958 --> 32:16.750
Uh, we heard about what
happened to Ms. Edgars.

32:16.833 --> 32:18.458
Is she alright?

32:18.542 --> 32:20.167
Lise? Oh, she's fine.

32:20.250 --> 32:21.583
Fine, couldn't be better,
actually.

32:21.667 --> 32:23.333
Good, good.

32:23.417 --> 32:25.625
Uh, please tell her that
everyone here at the company

32:25.708 --> 32:28.167
is very concerned
about her wellbeing.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.375
Really?
Well, that's kind of odd

32:30.458 --> 32:31.958
seeing as the guy
who came here to kill her

32:32.042 --> 32:34.000
was apparently hired by
someone in the company

32:34.083 --> 32:35.625
because you didn't want
her poking around in all

32:35.708 --> 32:38.625
those little back projects
you've been running.

32:38.708 --> 32:43.375
Well, uh, that's still
under investigation, in-house.

32:43.458 --> 32:45.375
Uh, all we do know

32:45.458 --> 32:48.542
is that for some unknown reason

32:48.625 --> 32:50.208
that this
unfortunate undertaking

32:50.292 --> 32:52.625
was executed by Gregory Fitch

32:52.708 --> 32:54.708
our head of security.

32:54.792 --> 32:56.708
We were planning
to confront him

32:56.792 --> 32:58.667
but, uh, apparently

32:58.750 --> 33:02.833
he hanged himself
in his home last night.

33:02.917 --> 33:04.583
In his suicide note

33:04.667 --> 33:07.375
he took responsibility
for the whole thing.

33:07.458 --> 33:10.333
So, anything else
you might have heard

33:10.417 --> 33:13.542
would be sheer speculation

33:13.625 --> 33:16.250
and impossible to prove.

33:16.333 --> 33:19.542
Yeah, yeah, looks like.

33:19.625 --> 33:21.917
Uh, Mr. Paretti, is it?

33:22.000 --> 33:23.583
- Yes.
- 'I see.'

33:23.667 --> 33:25.000
(Garibaldi)
'By the way,
how's your daughter?'

33:25.083 --> 33:27.417
Oh, fine. She starts
at Vassar in--

33:27.500 --> 33:28.500
'No, no, no, no.'

33:28.583 --> 33:30.375
The other one,
the one back on Earth.

33:30.458 --> 33:33.583
The one that your wife
doesn't know about?

33:33.667 --> 33:36.375
'Mr. Everson,
you're looking well.'

33:36.458 --> 33:38.250
'That's surprising considering
that little blonde'

33:38.333 --> 33:40.250
'that you've got on the side
there in Syria Planum.'

33:40.333 --> 33:41.625
'I gotta tell you,
she'd wear the hell'

33:41.708 --> 33:43.917
out of me in just a few hours.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.417
My regards to your wife,
by the way.

33:46.500 --> 33:48.208
Mr. Amestoy.

33:48.292 --> 33:50.208
'That woman that got spaced
when you and Mr. Paretti here'

33:50.292 --> 33:51.500
'got a little out of hand--'

33:51.583 --> 33:52.667
Just a minute--

33:52.750 --> 33:54.292
Oh, I know, I know
you're wondering

33:54.375 --> 33:55.750
how I got all this information
since I'm not

33:55.833 --> 33:58.917
the head of intelligence
for the Alliance anymore.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.333
I mean, after all

34:00.417 --> 34:02.417
that had to be one of your
biggest fears, wasn't it?

34:02.500 --> 34:04.333
'An alliance between Lise
and someone in a position'

34:04.417 --> 34:07.292
'to dig into your past had
to be your worst nightmare.'

34:07.375 --> 34:09.292
Well, I have a new one for you.

34:09.375 --> 34:11.792
Let me introduce you to
the new head of intelligence

34:11.875 --> 34:13.750
for the Interstellar Alliance.

34:18.292 --> 34:19.583
Hi.

34:19.667 --> 34:20.792
(Tessa)
'Pleased to meet you.'

34:20.875 --> 34:23.042
'I've heard so much about you.'

34:23.125 --> 34:26.875
Well, since I started
poking around, that is.

34:26.958 --> 34:29.625
The timing was perfect.

34:29.708 --> 34:32.333
You see, we've had
a lot of problems on Mars

34:32.417 --> 34:34.292
ever since we went independent.

34:34.375 --> 34:37.250
I had no idea that you six..

34:37.333 --> 34:39.083
Sorry, you five..

34:39.167 --> 34:41.292
'...were responsible
for so much of it.'

34:41.375 --> 34:44.167
Your personal issues aside.

34:44.250 --> 34:47.500
If even half of what I know now

34:47.583 --> 34:49.000
about the role you
played during our fight

34:49.083 --> 34:52.083
for independence got out..

34:52.167 --> 34:54.292
Well, does the expression

34:54.375 --> 34:56.792
"skinned alive" ring a bell?

34:58.083 --> 35:00.167
(Garibaldi)
Hmm, thank you.

35:00.250 --> 35:02.125
I think that just
about covers it.

35:02.208 --> 35:04.542
Why don't you go on ahead
and I'll catch up later?

35:06.792 --> 35:09.375
If you think you can
blackmail us--

35:09.458 --> 35:12.250
Oh, oh, no, no,
that's not the end of it.

35:12.333 --> 35:13.500
I just wanted to get
her out of the room

35:13.583 --> 35:16.625
before I got to
the really good part.

35:16.708 --> 35:18.083
'You see, that was just
the short-term solution'

35:18.167 --> 35:20.167
'to easing all of you
out of the building.'

35:20.250 --> 35:23.000
We've still got the problem
with the long term solution.

35:23.083 --> 35:25.500
Now, seeing as how I don't work
for the government anymore.

35:25.583 --> 35:28.000
I don't feel I have to play
by the usual rules.

35:28.083 --> 35:30.208
And since Lise and I
are married now

35:30.292 --> 35:33.083
we've got some plans for
the future of Edgars Industries.

35:33.167 --> 35:34.875
'Now, part of all that money
is going to go to'

35:34.958 --> 35:37.375
'repair the damage that
you people did back home.'

35:37.458 --> 35:39.500
'Some of the rest, well..'

35:43.708 --> 35:46.833
This is a check
for 500,000 credits.

35:48.542 --> 35:51.542
It will be deposited in a secret
account tomorrow morning.

35:51.625 --> 35:53.500
If anything should
happen to Lise and me

35:53.583 --> 35:55.208
you know, slip in the shower

35:55.292 --> 35:56.708
fall down a flight of stairs

35:56.792 --> 35:59.792
or die from anything
other than old age

35:59.875 --> 36:01.875
this money will be paid
out to certain individuals

36:01.958 --> 36:05.042
who will take out each
and every one of you.

36:05.125 --> 36:07.333
Now, I would have to imagine
at 100,000 credits a head

36:07.417 --> 36:08.875
every mercenary between
here and Earth

36:09.000 --> 36:10.583
will be out looking
to hunt you down.

36:10.667 --> 36:12.417
Am I clear, Mr. Paretti?

36:12.500 --> 36:16.417
As glass, Mr. Garibaldi.

36:16.500 --> 36:18.250
Good. Good.

36:18.333 --> 36:20.458
Now, I would like all
of your resignations on my desk

36:20.542 --> 36:21.833
before we arrive on Mars

36:21.917 --> 36:23.375
or the rest of the information
we have on you

36:23.458 --> 36:25.000
will be leaked to the media.

36:25.083 --> 36:26.958
I think that about covers it.

36:27.042 --> 36:28.083
Oh, Mr. Paretti?

36:28.167 --> 36:29.708
Hmm?

36:29.792 --> 36:31.917
Leave the cigars.

36:34.333 --> 36:36.583
(Franklin)
'Life Is full of surprises.'

36:36.667 --> 36:38.625
Tell me about it.

36:38.708 --> 36:41.042
I figured I'd come up
here for a few days

36:41.125 --> 36:45.208
exchange some information for an
offer of support from Sheridan.

36:45.292 --> 36:47.375
Who knew I'd end up
with a new job?

36:50.000 --> 36:52.125
The ironic part is that
I'm in a better position

36:52.208 --> 36:56.042
now to help Mars
than when I was there.

36:57.375 --> 36:59.417
Yeah, well, uh..

36:59.500 --> 37:01.750
When this place was built
I think irony was

37:01.833 --> 37:04.833
one of the primary materials
used in construction.

37:06.708 --> 37:09.458
Like the, uh, irony of
you coming here just when

37:09.542 --> 37:12.667
most of us, uh, me included,
are getting ready to leave.

37:13.667 --> 37:15.417
Yeah, I noticed that.

37:17.750 --> 37:20.792
On the other hand,
maybe it's for the best.

37:21.792 --> 37:23.792
I mean, look, Stephen

37:23.875 --> 37:25.875
what we had..

37:25.958 --> 37:27.875
...when we had time

37:27.958 --> 37:30.542
to have what we had.

37:30.625 --> 37:32.333
It was great.

37:32.417 --> 37:33.417
Yeah.

37:33.500 --> 37:35.917
It meant a lot to me.

37:37.875 --> 37:40.917
And it's not that
I don't need someone else.

37:41.000 --> 37:45.542
It's just that I-I don't need
someone else right now.

37:45.625 --> 37:48.667
There's so much going on
in my life these days that

37:48.750 --> 37:50.083
I can barely keep up with it.

37:50.167 --> 37:51.708
I know.

37:51.792 --> 37:54.000
You don't have to explain
anything to me.

37:54.083 --> 37:57.250
Yeah? You're talking to
another workaholic, remember?

37:58.417 --> 37:59.375
Yeah.

37:59.458 --> 38:01.750
I understand completely.

38:01.833 --> 38:03.458
It just wouldn't be, uh..

38:04.750 --> 38:06.417
...you know, practical.

38:06.500 --> 38:07.833
I mean, you being here and--

38:07.917 --> 38:10.042
And you'll be back in Earth Dome

38:10.125 --> 38:13.000
working at your
big important job.

38:13.083 --> 38:16.542
Probably pulling 24 hour
shifts, same as usual.

38:16.625 --> 38:18.208
Yeah, same as usual.

38:21.250 --> 38:23.375
So it really couldn't..

38:23.458 --> 38:25.833
No, you're right.

38:25.917 --> 38:27.417
It couldn't, uh..

38:29.458 --> 38:31.833
- So there we are.
- There you go, yeah.

38:34.958 --> 38:36.708
You know, I do have
about an hour

38:36.792 --> 38:39.542
before my next shift starts.

38:39.625 --> 38:41.917
'In case you wanted to, uh..'

38:42.958 --> 38:45.458
...celebrate your new job.

38:46.958 --> 38:49.542
More than an hour
or less than an hour?

38:49.625 --> 38:51.417
About an hour and 10 minutes.

38:52.958 --> 38:54.708
You go on ahead.

38:54.792 --> 38:56.500
You know how I like the lights.

38:57.917 --> 38:59.833
I'll take care of this.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.042

39:22.333 --> 39:24.042
- Hi!
- Hi.

39:25.708 --> 39:27.250
Oh, how was Minbar?

39:27.333 --> 39:29.042
Fine, fine.

39:29.125 --> 39:31.750
The new facilities are almost
ready for us to move in.

39:31.833 --> 39:34.625
I should think uh,
another week or so at most.

39:34.708 --> 39:37.208
Great, that's just great.

39:39.167 --> 39:42.208
Well, I told you this was going
to be tough on me, Delenn.

39:42.292 --> 39:45.292
It's like I said,
I'm going to miss this place.

39:45.375 --> 39:48.250
But, you know, I-I'll adjust.

39:48.333 --> 39:50.625
- I hope so.
- Yeah.

39:50.708 --> 39:51.958
Speaking of which, did I

39:52.042 --> 39:53.333
did I miss saying goodbye
to Michael?

39:53.417 --> 39:55.625
I wanted to see him
before he left.

39:55.708 --> 39:56.833
Well..

39:58.000 --> 39:59.625
Oh, you made it here
just in time.

39:59.708 --> 40:01.375
Another few minutes,
and you'd have to go

40:01.458 --> 40:03.208
all the way to Mars
just to say goodbye, yeah.

tell them to wait.

40:13.792 --> 40:15.833
- Take your time.
- Thanks.

40:18.333 --> 40:20.083
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

40:23.125 --> 40:24.833
I, uh..

40:24.917 --> 40:26.208
[sighs]

40:26.292 --> 40:29.833
I've never been really big
on goodbyes, and I..

40:29.917 --> 40:31.417
Ah, this just
isn't going to work.

40:31.500 --> 40:33.625
It's alright, Michael, go on.

40:35.167 --> 40:36.083
Well..

40:36.167 --> 40:38.417
It's just that..

40:38.500 --> 40:41.417
...all my family, my..

40:41.500 --> 40:42.750
...my mom and dad,
they passed away

40:42.833 --> 40:44.458
a long, long time ago.

40:46.250 --> 40:48.167
The two of you..

40:48.250 --> 40:50.083
And Stephen..

Hell, even Londo, you're the..

40:54.750 --> 40:57.125
You're the closest thing
that I've had to a family.

40:59.333 --> 41:00.583
'You know, I-I-I never thought'

41:00.667 --> 41:01.750
I was going to make
it out of here alive.

41:01.833 --> 41:03.042
I-I always figured, I'd end up

41:03.125 --> 41:05.625
face down somewhere
in brown sector.

41:08.125 --> 41:10.250
I'm glad that didn't happen.

41:11.583 --> 41:13.333
Because now I..

41:15.292 --> 41:17.625
I have a chance to have
a family of my own.

41:19.292 --> 41:21.333
Maybe I can find
a little happiness.

41:24.333 --> 41:26.083
I have the..

41:26.167 --> 41:27.542
I have the two of you
to thank for that

41:27.625 --> 41:30.125
more than anything
else in the world and..

41:30.208 --> 41:32.042

41:36.000 --> 41:37.542
I don't have the words.

41:39.167 --> 41:41.792
I just wish G'kar was here,
cause he'd know what to say.

- Thank you.
- Yeah.

Of all the recent partings,
I think, uh..

42:27.917 --> 42:30.000
...this will be the hardest.

42:31.625 --> 42:34.000
You think
he's going to be alright?

Yeah. Oh, yeah.

It occurs to me..

I have never walked
the length of this place
