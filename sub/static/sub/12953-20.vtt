00:29.667 --> 00:30.517
I'm in.

01:17.297 --> 01:19.248
Hey. There's a cab waiting outside.

01:19.434 --> 01:21.338
She wouldn't let me drive her to the airport.

01:21.431 --> 01:22.902
Is everything okay?

01:23.275 --> 01:24.653
The Lisbon police called.

01:24.840 --> 01:26.456
It's safe for Sophia to go home.

01:26.549 --> 01:28.165
Oh, that's great.

01:28.258 --> 01:30.734
- I'm so glad you came.
- Thank you.

01:34.586 --> 01:36.528
Look at the two of you.

01:37.465 --> 01:40.803
Such beautiful and smart women.

01:43.320 --> 01:45.750
Before I make a fool of myself...

01:47.720 --> 01:49.390
Promise you'll come back.

01:49.620 --> 01:53.910
Nadia, for you, anything.

02:11.150 --> 02:13.867
Oh, hey. Vaughn, could you sign this?

02:14.288 --> 02:15.713
It's for Weiss. His grandfather died.

02:15.833 --> 02:17.066
Yeah. Actually, can I do it in a little bit?

02:17.159 --> 02:18.488
I need to ask Jack something first.

02:18.581 --> 02:19.863
Oh, sure. No problem.

02:22.578 --> 02:23.381
Where you going?

02:23.477 --> 02:26.175
Well, I thought I'd go with you to get Mr. Bristow to sign this while we're in there.

02:26.265 --> 02:28.263
You know what? Actually I need to see him alone. It's kind of personal.

02:28.356 --> 02:28.873
Oh.

02:29.904 --> 02:33.338
Uh, since when can you tell Mr. Bristow something you can't tell me?

02:33.430 --> 02:34.758
This is something I need to ask Jack.

02:34.852 --> 02:37.186
If you were Sydney's father, I could ask you, but you're not.

02:37.232 --> 02:38.657
No, I'm not.

02:38.749 --> 02:43.667
I still don't understand what me not being Sydney's father has to do with you --

02:46.053 --> 02:47.335
Understand now?

02:47.567 --> 02:48.542
Oh, my god.

02:48.964 --> 02:50.723
Hey, man, congratulations. That's fantastic.

02:50.844 --> 02:51.267
Thanks.

02:51.410 --> 02:52.736
I'm sure Mr. Bristow's gonna be thrilled.

02:53.531 --> 02:54.525
Really?

02:54.665 --> 02:57.047
I'm just hoping he doesn't shoot me on the spot.

03:08.638 --> 03:11.114
As if weapon-grade Anthrax grows on trees.

03:12.423 --> 03:13.322
What is it?

03:13.444 --> 03:14.485
Oh, if this is a bad time, I can --

03:14.578 --> 03:15.524
No, please.

03:16.040 --> 03:19.328
After dealing with that chechnyan lunatic for the past couple of hours,

03:19.420 --> 03:22.041
whatever business you have will be a welcome relief.

03:28.549 --> 03:30.309
Well, we've, um...

03:32.836 --> 03:34.356
I know you're a man who --

03:34.964 --> 03:37.966
I know you're a man who respects tradition. As do I. And --

03:38.060 --> 03:39.868
Please get to the point, agent Vaughn.

03:41.037 --> 03:42.655
I'm gonna ask Sydney to marry me,

03:42.838 --> 03:44.693
and I'd like your blessing.

03:48.626 --> 03:52.685
Perhaps you believe my recent illness rendered me less coherent than before,

03:52.821 --> 03:58.311
or that my cognitive faculties have been somehow dulled or diminished.

03:59.855 --> 04:02.714
Allow me to clarify the facts for you, agent Vaughn.

04:02.807 --> 04:06.766
While I've come to believe you're not as useless as I first imagined,

04:07.844 --> 04:10.078
I still don't feel you have --

04:17.199 --> 04:20.204
Everyone please remain where you are. This is a warranted search.

04:22.402 --> 04:23.354
May I see that?

04:24.593 --> 04:27.316
We've been authorized to confiscate all relevant materials.

04:27.917 --> 04:29.437
It's been signed by director Chase.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.918
- Where's your sister?
- What?

04:34.011 --> 04:35.962
I expect your full cooperation.

04:39.426 --> 04:41.568
- If Nadia's in some kind of trouble --
- Where is she?

04:44.564 --> 04:45.560
In the shower.

04:57.640 --> 04:59.352
Stand down, agent Santos.

05:04.690 --> 05:05.778
What's this about?

05:06.087 --> 05:09.902
Men are dead, things are gone, and you've got some explaining to do.

05:32.341 --> 05:34.619
- Is this yours?
- Yes.

05:37.241 --> 05:40.195
Does anyone else use it or have access to it?

05:40.476 --> 05:42.044
- No.
- Not even Sydney?

05:42.137 --> 05:44.375
I said no. Sydney has her own laptop.

05:44.889 --> 05:46.935
- She also has --
- An assault rifle,

05:47.029 --> 05:48.310
a 12-gauge shotgun,

05:48.544 --> 05:49.680
four handguns,

05:49.866 --> 05:52.057
two tazers, and a...

05:52.757 --> 05:54.565
secret drawer of knives.

05:55.294 --> 05:56.240
Let's start with the knives.

05:56.333 --> 05:58.235
Let's start with you not wasting my time.

05:58.404 --> 05:59.782
Director Chase says men are dead.

06:00.154 --> 06:02.918
What men? What does she think Nadia did?

06:03.013 --> 06:05.919
We know you overrode the DSR security system tonight.

06:06.012 --> 06:06.482
What?

06:06.580 --> 06:08.813
Alarms on an access door were deactivated.

06:08.912 --> 06:11.670
We traced the override command to your laptop.

06:11.810 --> 06:14.622
And you just told me that you're the only one who uses it.

06:14.715 --> 06:16.624
Yes, but I didn't do it.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.138
We also have evidence that tonight's incident

06:19.465 --> 06:22.851
isn't the only one that leads back to you and this laptop.

06:38.726 --> 06:39.959
We have clearance.

06:45.017 --> 06:47.733
- A micro transmitter?
- In the medallion.

06:48.301 --> 06:51.823
- When did she give you this?
- A few weeks ago.

06:52.804 --> 06:54.757
Why would Sophia do something like that?

06:54.877 --> 06:57.259
It would help explain why several missions were compromised.

06:57.819 --> 07:01.306
I personally investigated Sophia Vargas when she first arrived.

07:01.768 --> 07:05.345
Prints, background -- everything came back clean.

07:05.391 --> 07:07.999
Well, somebody tapped into agent Santos' laptop.

07:08.274 --> 07:12.087
And because of it, five agents are dead and several Rambaldi artifacts are gone.

07:12.181 --> 07:13.989
I don't believe it. I won't.

07:14.083 --> 07:15.222
Why would she do this?

07:15.313 --> 07:17.167
I think our clue lies in what was stolen.

07:17.260 --> 07:18.637
You're  reaching for straws, Jack.

07:18.736 --> 07:19.582
Am I?

07:20.376 --> 07:22.518
Who else would be capable of pulling this off?

07:22.939 --> 07:24.508
What are you talking about?

07:27.365 --> 07:28.882
Elena.

07:30.380 --> 07:33.337
You think Sophia Vargas is connected to Elena Derevko?

07:33.431 --> 07:37.053
No. I think Sophia Vargas is Elena Derevko.

07:37.709 --> 07:40.042
Arvin and I have been searching for her for months.

07:40.417 --> 07:41.936
I believe she found us first.

07:42.077 --> 07:43.931
Has been using us to achieve her own end.

07:44.024 --> 07:46.789
You  mean the journal of Vaughn's father, Sloane Clone --

07:46.891 --> 07:48.401
McCullough, everything.

07:48.970 --> 07:52.012
- It's been Elena all along.
- Oh, my god.

07:53.042 --> 07:55.040
You're saying it's all a lie?

07:56.077 --> 08:00.661
That she spent all these years, all this time, so she could steal some Rambaldi artifacts?

08:00.744 --> 08:02.551
She is a Derevko.

08:03.205 --> 08:06.735
Her sisters possessed that same single-minded purpose.

08:06.827 --> 08:08.157
If Jack is right,

08:08.342 --> 08:10.466
if Elena has gathered Rambaldi artifacts,

08:10.559 --> 08:13.038
her final step would be to assemble them.

08:13.647 --> 08:15.503
We can't let that happen.

08:51.912 --> 08:53.341
She never made it to the airport.

08:53.527 --> 08:55.529
The cab dropped her off a few blocks from our house.

08:55.615 --> 08:57.566
Have Marshall check traffic cams in the area.

08:57.660 --> 09:01.906
I already did. I've also notified the FAA to check flight manifests,

09:02.029 --> 09:05.031
and I updated train and bus stations with her current I.D.

09:05.125 --> 09:07.553
Good. We will find her.

09:08.866 --> 09:12.010
I brought her into my house. This is my fault.

09:12.103 --> 09:14.343
No, Nadia. It's mine.

09:16.871 --> 09:19.586
It was my obsession with Rambaldi that pulled you into this.

09:19.730 --> 09:21.006
It's my mess.

09:21.100 --> 09:23.395
It's my responsibility to clean it up.

09:23.712 --> 09:27.003
I can only imagine how hard this must be for you -- the betrayal.

09:27.096 --> 09:28.663
I'm just glad we found her.

09:29.317 --> 09:30.935
That I know the truth.

09:32.105 --> 09:32.777
Yeah.

09:34.065 --> 09:38.111
So, if Elena has all the Rambaldi pieces, there is only one place she can go.

09:38.298 --> 09:40.535
- To see Lazlo Drake.
- Yes.

09:40.630 --> 09:41.433
I'm on it.

09:42.321 --> 09:43.124
Nadia?

09:45.652 --> 09:47.890
We'll find her. I promise you.

09:50.166 --> 09:51.591
I will end this.

10:00.590 --> 10:01.529
I don't understand.

10:01.680 --> 10:05.915
Why are we in China when I already told you Rambaldi's sphere of life is buried in Siena?

10:06.940 --> 10:10.280
Because I need answers to a few final questions.

10:12.570 --> 10:16.010
Lazlo Drake is the only man in the world who can provide that.

10:22.732 --> 10:26.024
Before he went into hiding, Drake was a professor of european history.

10:26.303 --> 10:30.171
He built his reputation on the single most important discovery of his life --

10:31.766 --> 10:33.088
a manuscript.

10:33.512 --> 10:37.580
In effect a template describing how Rambaldi's creations were to be assembled

10:37.610 --> 10:40.279
in order to bring forth his final prophecy.

10:44.492 --> 10:46.731
Just know that we're going to make the world a better place,

10:47.244 --> 10:49.250
and we need Drake to do it.

10:52.286 --> 10:55.568
- Professor Drake, my name is...
- Arvin Sloane. Yes.

10:55.623 --> 10:56.951
You know who I am?

10:57.092 --> 10:59.669
How could I possibly not know of you, Mr. Sloane?

10:59.758 --> 11:04.005
Your appetite for all things Rambaldi is almost legendary.

11:04.103 --> 11:06.001
This is my daughter Nadia.

11:08.793 --> 11:10.032
My god.

11:10.358 --> 11:13.417
I am honored to meet you.

11:13.776 --> 11:14.673
Thanks.

11:16.031 --> 11:17.409
Lovely.

11:18.343 --> 11:19.350
Please.

11:29.603 --> 11:33.127
You have no idea what it is like to be in your presence.

11:33.498 --> 11:35.878
It is like meeting the virgin Mary.

11:36.655 --> 11:39.323
- What do you mean?
- Drake, you know why we're here.

11:39.377 --> 11:41.655
You have collected the sphere of life.

11:41.748 --> 11:43.838
No, not yet, but we know where it is.

11:44.084 --> 11:48.949
If it is not in your possession, we have nothing to discuss.

11:49.048 --> 11:52.189
You have the only known translation of Rambaldi's vademecum --

11:52.329 --> 11:55.429
instructions for how the pieces fit together. I need to know.

11:55.521 --> 12:01.014
That is information I will share with whomever has all the artifacts in his possession.

12:01.292 --> 12:03.003
Your visit is premature, Mr. Sloane.

12:03.096 --> 12:06.483
I suggest you come back when you have retrieved all the items,

12:06.622 --> 12:08.765
including the sphere.

12:10.262 --> 12:12.023
You will come back, too, won't you?

12:12.356 --> 12:13.868
I would like that.

12:15.235 --> 12:20.145
Nadia, I wonder if you would let me speak to the professor alone.

12:22.296 --> 12:26.459
I never thought I would see, let alone touch with my own hands,

12:26.494 --> 12:28.732
a living embodiment.

12:30.191 --> 12:34.239
- My daughter is not an artifact.
- So protective of her?

12:34.333 --> 12:35.661
She is my daughter.

12:35.754 --> 12:39.046
You brought her on this journey for one reason --

12:39.776 --> 12:42.740
only she can retrieve the sphere of life.

12:43.712 --> 12:47.481
Only she knows its secret location.

12:47.949 --> 12:49.621
You know that.

12:54.622 --> 12:57.344
I didn't come this far to quit.

13:04.036 --> 13:05.084
This is it.

13:28.592 --> 13:33.183
Rambaldi wrote that a man would come and discover the true meaning of his work,

13:33.641 --> 13:37.140
and in doing so would change the world.

13:37.874 --> 13:39.632
I always wanted to be that man.

14:10.113 --> 14:11.481
It's made of glass.

14:24.128 --> 14:25.080
Think of it.

14:26.477 --> 14:31.730
You and I are the first ones to set foot in here in almost 500 years.

14:32.289 --> 14:35.850
Do you have any idea how many lesser people have dreamed of this moment?

14:39.034 --> 14:41.127
And only you can complete this.

14:42.064 --> 14:42.964
What?

14:44.797 --> 14:48.862
Nadia, this is the part of the journey that I can't take.

14:51.466 --> 14:52.758
You  have to bring the box.

14:54.481 --> 14:55.583
I don't understand.

14:57.067 --> 14:59.018
Rambaldi had a role for you to play.

14:59.814 --> 15:01.382
I need you to do this, Nadia.

15:03.068 --> 15:05.977
I need you to bring me that sphere.

15:13.541 --> 15:14.381
Nadia...

15:16.240 --> 15:18.818
we can change the world.

15:19.890 --> 15:20.596
Go.

15:26.356 --> 15:27.177
Go.

15:38.821 --> 15:39.958
Have faith, sweetheart.

15:51.949 --> 15:52.902
Yes.

15:58.325 --> 16:01.453
Now, Nadia, bring the box to me.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.057
You lied.

16:19.724 --> 16:21.163
It was not about peace.

16:22.366 --> 16:24.796
Nadia, I am your father.

16:25.517 --> 16:27.556
You will go back there and bring me the box.

16:29.059 --> 16:30.895
You get back there. I want that box.

16:31.316 --> 16:35.050
You think you can control this power, but it's poisoning you. Don't you see it?

16:35.879 --> 16:38.452
You don't have to do this. Please.

16:39.061 --> 16:41.538
Let's just walk away, you and I, together.

16:43.364 --> 16:44.310
Coward!

16:47.119 --> 16:48.498
Please, let's just go.

16:48.777 --> 16:50.249
I don't need you.

17:06.224 --> 17:07.790
He chose me.

17:16.892 --> 17:17.635
See?

18:04.595 --> 18:05.921
You're still here.

18:06.266 --> 18:09.350
Try not to talk. You've lost a lot of blood.

18:10.380 --> 18:14.460
I didn't think that you would be here after I --

18:15.104 --> 18:16.323
You're my father.

18:17.492 --> 18:19.349
I'm going to get you out of here.

18:23.563 --> 18:24.365
Thank you.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.059
That shard of glass in your chest --

18:27.918 --> 18:30.475
when I move you, it might kill you. I need to pull it out.

18:30.942 --> 18:31.669
Okay.

18:49.756 --> 18:50.244
Who's Lazlo Drake?

18:50.322 --> 18:54.594
He is the self-appointed gatekeeper to Rambaldi's endgame.

18:54.709 --> 18:57.957
For Elena to complete her plan, she will have to contact him.

18:58.110 --> 18:59.924
He has what amounts to the instruction booklet.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.586
I'm sorry, maybe it's only me, but

19:01.959 --> 19:03.744
what do you mean when you say "Rambaldi's endgame"?

19:03.861 --> 19:06.170
I mean, what is it? Is it a scenario, a weapon?

19:06.286 --> 19:08.932
In Elena's hands, most likely an apocalypse.

19:09.539 --> 19:12.448
Which is why we need to get to Lazlo Drake before she does.

19:12.787 --> 19:16.513
Drake's completely off the grid. The manuscript has made him a target.

19:16.636 --> 19:18.253
He never stays in one place too long.

19:18.374 --> 19:20.392
We saw him in China. He could be anywhere.

19:20.486 --> 19:22.826
If Drake's gone underground, he needs a source of income.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.395
That's the path I've been pursuing.

19:26.510 --> 19:28.636
Greyson Wells, billionaire financier.

19:29.122 --> 19:31.724
Organized crime, money laundering. CIA's been watching him for years.

19:31.817 --> 19:35.490
He's also the man who financed most of Drake's early research into Rambaldi.

19:35.584 --> 19:37.926
If they're in communication, he might know where to find Drake.

19:38.011 --> 19:40.824
Agreed. Coordinate with ops. Draft up a plan to approach Wells.

19:41.010 --> 19:45.086
I'll start preparations to talk to Lazlo Drake myself as soon as we have his location.

19:45.300 --> 19:50.745
I believe you're forbidden from participating in cases involving this particular subject matter.

19:50.837 --> 19:54.079
- Agent Dixon has a point.
- Yes, I'm aware of the agreement.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.790
- But I have a history with Drake.
- So does Nadia.

19:56.882 --> 19:59.742
I'm sure Nadia would agree that her presence would only complicate matters.

20:00.818 --> 20:02.004
He's right.

20:02.248 --> 20:03.739
Drake will talk to me.

20:03.832 --> 20:06.454
If we approach this tactically, his security force will respond.

20:06.569 --> 20:10.047
We cannot let this turn into a firefight. Our timetable is too critical.

20:12.322 --> 20:14.274
Proceed as instructed.

20:14.488 --> 20:18.210
Once you have a location on Drake, you'll relay it to director Sloane.

20:19.286 --> 20:21.144
That's it, people. Be safe.

20:40.006 --> 20:42.578
Don't touch the fur.

20:44.469 --> 20:46.244
All right, you may touch the fur.

20:47.257 --> 20:48.258
Once.

21:10.007 --> 21:13.637
Please let me know if there is anything in particular

21:13.907 --> 21:14.948
that you would like to see.

21:16.404 --> 21:17.944
Ahh. Very good.

21:18.995 --> 21:20.181
Platinum Liana.

21:22.055 --> 21:26.179
Fully paired with the flawless brilliance.

21:26.440 --> 21:29.745
Can be worn as either a bracelet or an anklet.

21:30.291 --> 21:31.096
Put.

21:41.611 --> 21:44.269
What do you think, ankle or wrist?

21:44.970 --> 21:48.451
Well, to be honest, I've always found anklets to be a bit vulgar,

21:49.107 --> 21:51.923
though admittedly you are making me rethink my position.

21:53.244 --> 21:56.780
I think I'd have to see it on your wrist before I gave an informed opinion.

21:58.912 --> 21:59.955
Do.

22:19.362 --> 22:20.434
Something wrong?

22:22.868 --> 22:24.963
It appears we have a mutual interest.

22:27.706 --> 22:29.013
So it seems.

22:38.915 --> 22:42.732
Hmm. Better as a bracelet.

22:44.865 --> 22:46.695
Will you allow me to buy it for you?

22:47.865 --> 22:49.601
You trying to impress me?

22:50.183 --> 22:52.567
Well, that depends. Is it working?

22:54.346 --> 22:57.589
Sweetheart, it's not your money I'm interested in.

23:00.515 --> 23:01.916
I'm going with you to see Drake.

23:02.007 --> 23:03.204
This is not your call, Sydney.

23:03.287 --> 23:06.123
It is now. I have his location. I'll go alone if I have to.

23:06.209 --> 23:07.759
Well, he's not gonna talk to you.

23:07.994 --> 23:09.439
Then I suggest you get on a plane.

23:10.261 --> 23:13.077
Solana airfield outside Mexico City, 0800 hours.

23:13.165 --> 23:16.084
I'll be there when you land, and we'll go see Drake together.

23:22.561 --> 23:23.007
Thank you.

23:43.999 --> 23:46.428
Well, all the parts are pretty generic.

23:46.570 --> 23:49.523
I mean, it'd be really difficult to track where it came from.

23:50.507 --> 23:51.221
Sorry.

23:51.371 --> 23:52.058
It's all right.

23:52.666 --> 23:54.428
I  just feel stupid I trusted her.

23:54.551 --> 23:58.727
Hey, I don't blame you. I mean, she was like family.

23:59.655 --> 24:01.941
You know, but don't put this on yourself. I mean,

24:02.034 --> 24:05.551
hell, I trusted Sloane for six years before I found out he was evil.

24:05.865 --> 24:06.598
You know...

24:07.346 --> 24:10.945
not that he's evil, per se...

24:12.655 --> 24:15.565
We have a long history together.

24:16.451 --> 24:20.702
Look, we're gonna find this Sophia/Elena woman person.

24:21.636 --> 24:23.115
Your dad's totally on it.

24:41.120 --> 24:42.667
This is a reckless course of action.

24:42.748 --> 24:43.616
Try calculated.

24:43.899 --> 24:47.077
I'm not letting you meet with a man who's gonna tell you how to put the Rambaldi contraption together.

24:47.157 --> 24:48.237
That's ridiculous.

24:48.563 --> 24:51.060
I had everything I needed last year, and I gave it up. You know that, Sydney.

24:51.153 --> 24:52.342
You didn't have everything.

24:52.431 --> 24:54.492
You're putting yourself in danger by coming with me.

24:54.882 --> 24:55.781
I know what I'm doing.

24:56.282 --> 24:57.145
I just hope you do,

24:57.286 --> 24:59.776
because I swear if this is about you and your twisted beliefs --

24:59.855 --> 25:01.375
Do you have any idea what Nadia's been through?

25:01.523 --> 25:02.944
Betrayed by the woman who raised her.

25:03.127 --> 25:05.389
I would never do anything to put her in any more pain.

25:05.834 --> 25:07.256
I'm here for one reason alone --

25:07.407 --> 25:09.444
to put an end to this nightmare once and for all.

25:11.175 --> 25:12.555
I wish I could believe you.

25:31.484 --> 25:32.341
Looks cozy.

25:43.189 --> 25:44.263
Elena got here before us.

25:54.535 --> 25:55.343
It's Drake.

25:55.853 --> 25:57.183
He's dead, isn't he?

25:59.825 --> 26:02.232
If I didn't have to rendezvous with you, I would have been here hours ago.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.654
If it weren't for you, we wouldn't have to be here at all.

26:19.550 --> 26:20.448
What are you doing?

27:00.212 --> 27:01.301
See if you can rewind the feed.

27:04.531 --> 27:08.465
Here, let's start over again at the beginning.

27:08.688 --> 27:12.072
I have to admit, I did not think it would be you.

27:12.370 --> 27:16.168
You thought Arvin Sloane would have all the artifacts.

27:16.590 --> 27:18.792
He nearly completed the work once before.

27:18.873 --> 27:19.678
And failed.

27:20.305 --> 27:21.502
He threw it away.

27:22.358 --> 27:24.124
And for what?

27:24.930 --> 27:25.701
The girl.

27:27.661 --> 27:30.544
Do you have a secure facility to assemble everything?

27:31.014 --> 27:34.452
I do. A factory outside of --

27:36.908 --> 27:40.210
I'm sorry, Sydney. I'm so sorry.

27:49.063 --> 27:51.509
Sloane tranqued me. That bastard knocked me out before I could get Elena's location.

27:51.601 --> 27:52.167
Are you all right?

27:52.339 --> 27:53.982
I saw this coming, and he still beat me.

27:54.248 --> 27:56.207
Sydney, are you sure you're okay?

27:56.480 --> 27:57.395
Dad, I'm okay.

27:58.596 --> 28:00.930
I'll notify director Chase. We'll find him.

28:01.351 --> 28:02.392
Agent Dixon.

28:05.300 --> 28:07.486
Why didn't you stop Sloane when you had the chance?

28:07.812 --> 28:09.435
I understand your reaction.

28:10.004 --> 28:13.012
You just opened the door to temptation and let Sloane walk through it?

28:13.096 --> 28:13.958
End of discussion.

28:17.948 --> 28:18.913
Hey...

28:21.954 --> 28:23.636
This man's taken lives.

28:24.741 --> 28:26.617
I did what I thought was best.

28:31.373 --> 28:32.053
I know.

28:35.872 --> 28:41.232
In spite of all this, it's good to see you.

28:44.177 --> 28:44.639
Yeah.

28:54.428 --> 28:58.418
- Weekends aren't enough.
- Tell me about it.

29:04.409 --> 29:04.945
Yes?

29:05.186 --> 29:06.905
I had an idea, but you're gonna hate it.

29:07.029 --> 29:08.722
You want me to talk to your aunt Katya.

29:09.095 --> 29:10.104
How did you know that?

29:10.230 --> 29:12.488
First you said I would hate the idea, and you're correct.

29:12.609 --> 29:14.775
Second, I arrived at the same conclusion myself.

29:15.183 --> 29:16.587
We're at a complete impasse here.

29:16.689 --> 29:18.974
Time is running out, and she's the only Derevko we have.

29:19.300 --> 29:20.841
Call your afterwards.

29:26.909 --> 29:28.382
Lock the door behind me.

29:29.207 --> 29:32.371
Is that look on your face supposed to be intimidating?

29:33.401 --> 29:34.683
You forget, Jack --

29:35.056 --> 29:36.435
I've seen your tender side.

29:36.526 --> 29:39.561
I need everything you know about Elena's operations -- right now.

29:40.328 --> 29:42.007
What makes you think I know anything?

29:42.906 --> 29:44.444
Call it an instinct.

29:45.563 --> 29:47.165
Do you intend to torture me?

29:47.834 --> 29:48.719
If I have to.

29:50.217 --> 29:53.365
While I know that would be enjoyable for both of us,

29:54.233 --> 29:57.858
I should warn you, I have quite a bit of stamina.

29:58.963 --> 30:01.029
But you already know that about me.

30:01.176 --> 30:02.641
What do you want, Katya?

30:02.868 --> 30:05.095
Full pardon. Immediate release.

30:05.234 --> 30:07.281
- I don't have that authority.
- You'll find a way.

30:09.822 --> 30:12.371
If the information you provide leads us to Elena,

30:13.440 --> 30:17.169
I will do everything in my power to procure your freedom. You have my word.

30:17.628 --> 30:18.827
If you're here,

30:19.282 --> 30:21.729
my sister must be pursuing aggressive action.

30:21.970 --> 30:22.892
What has she done?

30:23.027 --> 30:25.793
She broke into the DSR, stole a cache of Rambaldi artifacts.

30:25.963 --> 30:29.589
She has been acquiring artifacts for several years now through her front.

30:29.682 --> 30:32.707
- Her front?
- Don't look so surprised.

30:32.885 --> 30:35.158
It has been happening right before your eyes.

30:36.703 --> 30:37.850
The Covenant.

30:38.119 --> 30:40.884
See? I knew you could do it, handsome.

30:40.976 --> 30:44.307
Elena ran the Covenant? That's impossible. We dismantled its operations.

30:44.407 --> 30:46.147
No, that's what she wanted you to believe.

30:46.634 --> 30:48.127
You took down a straw man.

30:48.481 --> 30:51.533
Elena's agenda's always been the same. It's always been Rambaldi.

30:51.904 --> 30:54.973
- How do we stop her?
- You are asking the wrong sister.

30:55.953 --> 30:59.990
Irina spent the last few years of her life tracking Elena.

31:00.480 --> 31:04.183
She was determined to stop our sister from enacting her endgame.

31:04.792 --> 31:07.166
And she would have done it, too, but...

31:07.660 --> 31:11.782
you had to go and put a bullet in her head.

31:12.300 --> 31:13.472
I was set up.

31:14.821 --> 31:17.777
Elena put a hit out on Sydney, framed Irina for it.

31:18.199 --> 31:19.288
Oh, I see.

31:20.083 --> 31:23.759
So you executed my sister on a misunderstanding.

31:23.898 --> 31:25.639
Oh, then all is forgiven.

31:26.048 --> 31:29.739
Don't stand there pretending you're a patsy. You're too good at what you do.

31:29.889 --> 31:34.238
If you pulled the trigger, part of you wanted to be manipulated.

31:35.474 --> 31:39.378
I can help you find Elena, but unfortunately

31:39.672 --> 31:42.341
I cannot tell you how to stop her.

31:42.854 --> 31:45.255
Thanks to you, that hope died with Irina.

31:52.710 --> 31:55.639
Sydney, listen carefully. Elena Derevko is in Prague.

31:55.919 --> 32:00.024
Her base of operations is a decommissioned chemical facility south of the industrial zone.

32:00.304 --> 32:02.361
And Katya knew that? She just gave you that location?

32:02.534 --> 32:04.373
No, Katya never just gives anything.

32:04.653 --> 32:07.668
But she tied Elena to the Covenant, knew she worked out of Europe.

32:07.936 --> 32:10.380
Marshall and Vaughn were able to pinpoint her exact location

32:10.552 --> 32:13.722
based on declassified KGB files and some thermal satellite imaging.

32:14.064 --> 32:15.261
And you think we can trust her?

32:15.586 --> 32:17.223
She's a Derevko.

32:17.565 --> 32:21.549
I need you to get on a plane and rendezvous with Dixon and Nadia at Ruzyne airport.

32:21.634 --> 32:23.678
The cargo terminal. They have your ops plan.

32:23.846 --> 32:24.869
I'm on my way.

32:52.868 --> 32:54.822
My men think you're here to kill me.

32:55.055 --> 32:56.669
You should hire smarter men.

33:00.884 --> 33:05.734
You walk in, unarmed, and surrender yourself.

33:07.589 --> 33:12.429
You're not the most convincing of assassins, so let me guess.

33:13.318 --> 33:15.344
You're here to offer me a deal.

33:15.609 --> 33:17.342
I know what you're trying to do.

33:17.730 --> 33:18.919
I can help.

33:20.274 --> 33:21.698
Thank god.

33:22.306 --> 33:24.277
You're wise enough to see my value.

33:25.068 --> 33:27.979
There's no one on this Earth who knows more about Milo Rambaldi.

33:29.178 --> 33:30.923
I'd heard you reformed.

33:32.087 --> 33:34.069
I suppose I've been born again.

33:42.770 --> 33:45.773
Perimeter security has been disabled. Phoenix and team are on the move.

33:45.927 --> 33:48.874
Copy, Phoenix. Director Chase has authorized shoot to kill.

33:49.571 --> 33:50.469
Copy that.

33:50.656 --> 33:52.631
Okay, now, we have the facility on thermal satellite.

33:52.706 --> 33:54.412
Looks like there are about 40 people inside.

33:54.787 --> 33:56.565
The blueprints we acquired were accurate.

33:56.686 --> 33:58.542
There are three main areas to secure.

33:58.990 --> 33:59.649
Understood.

33:59.929 --> 34:02.524
- Sydney, be careful.
- Copy. Let's move.

35:03.534 --> 35:04.768
The prisoner, right?

35:05.469 --> 35:05.660
Come on.

35:06.740 --> 35:08.045
Yes, of course. I'm bringing her down.

35:14.716 --> 35:16.871
Transferring prisoner.

35:34.891 --> 35:36.481
I was as surprised as you are.

35:36.693 --> 35:37.517
Drop your weapon.

35:38.104 --> 35:39.695
No, Marcus, drop yours.

35:40.422 --> 35:42.152
I said drop your weapon, Sloane!

35:42.610 --> 35:44.332
I got 'em. Pinpointing a location.

35:54.101 --> 35:55.973
They're at the loading dock. East side of the building.

35:57.071 --> 35:58.111
Put your weapon on the ground.

35:58.566 --> 36:00.971
I warned Sydney. I warned all of you not to do this.

36:01.412 --> 36:02.291
I mean it.

36:02.570 --> 36:04.571
Please, Marcus, it's too big now.

36:05.317 --> 36:07.573
You can't stop this. Only I can.

36:20.579 --> 36:23.054
- You'll have to trust me.
- Trust you?

36:23.616 --> 36:25.233
Get out of here now.

36:33.745 --> 36:34.709
Outrigger, report.

36:36.184 --> 36:37.991
Outrigger, report!

36:49.232 --> 36:50.231
Time to leave.

37:12.476 --> 37:13.230
Dixon!

37:15.529 --> 37:18.145
Evergreen to base. We need an emergency medical extraction.

37:18.238 --> 37:20.525
We have a man down. Repeat, we have a man down.

37:21.229 --> 37:21.790
Dixon.

37:55.130 --> 37:57.189
If anything changes, you call me.

38:02.431 --> 38:04.359
Did you have any idea she and Dixon...

38:04.549 --> 38:04.977
No.

38:05.979 --> 38:08.298
But then I tend to miss those kinds of details.

38:09.201 --> 38:11.109
What are you talking about? You're the master of details.

38:11.412 --> 38:11.976
Really?

38:13.007 --> 38:15.293
I've gone over the details a thousand times in my mind.

38:16.180 --> 38:18.198
Each one added up to the same conclusion--

38:18.937 --> 38:24.062
that your life was in danger and your mother was the lethal threat.

38:24.645 --> 38:26.310
Dad, we've gone over this. You don't need --

38:26.481 --> 38:29.192
I've lived my life trusting in the veracity of details,

38:29.744 --> 38:32.665
and in doing so I lost sight of the one thing I know to be true.

38:34.062 --> 38:35.897
Your mother would never hurt you.

38:37.577 --> 38:40.262
She was ready to shut Elena down, and I killed her.

38:42.336 --> 38:44.694
- She was our only hope.
- That's not true.

38:46.092 --> 38:47.553
We can stop them.

38:48.489 --> 38:49.419
I know it.

38:51.028 --> 38:52.759
You and I may disagree on a lot of things,

38:52.878 --> 38:54.648
but I never question your motives.

38:56.042 --> 38:58.903
You always have my best interests at heart. I know that.

39:03.904 --> 39:05.060
How's Nadia feeling?

39:11.287 --> 39:13.253
I don't think she's feeling much of anything right now.

39:19.373 --> 39:22.052
How could you let Sydney and Nadia follow?

39:22.520 --> 39:24.565
Everything is proceeding as planned.

39:25.213 --> 39:26.559
You talk the talk,

39:28.079 --> 39:31.811
but I'm still not convinced you've returned to the fold.

39:33.524 --> 39:37.438
We'll see if you have what it takes to finish the journey.

39:49.251 --> 39:49.958
How's Dixon?

39:50.070 --> 39:51.650
The same. Sydney and Nadia are there now.

39:54.847 --> 39:58.855
You asked me a question earlier that I didn't get a chance to answer properly.

39:58.945 --> 40:00.331
I'd say the answer was loud and clear.

40:00.790 --> 40:02.672
We're more alike than I care to admit, agent Vaughn.

40:04.029 --> 40:06.268
And I realize now that in disapproving of you

40:06.426 --> 40:08.793
I was only hating my own limitations.

40:10.240 --> 40:13.009
I wasn't asking myself what would be best for Sydney.

40:15.507 --> 40:18.682
If you honestly believe that you can make my daughter happy,

40:19.707 --> 40:23.035
then by all means you have my blessing to marry her.

40:28.624 --> 40:29.289
Okay then.

40:39.055 --> 40:41.072
You always knew my father would do this.

40:42.864 --> 40:44.414
I hoped he wouldn't.

40:45.804 --> 40:50.337
Despite everything, I really believed that he chose me.

40:52.210 --> 40:53.826
You must think I'm pretty foolish.

40:54.201 --> 40:55.206
Of course not.

40:55.944 --> 40:56.838
He's your father.

40:59.072 --> 41:01.743
Agent Bristow, agent Santos, he's asking for you.

41:14.481 --> 41:15.261
Dixon?

41:16.688 --> 41:18.034
We have been so worried about you.

41:19.383 --> 41:22.378
Before I saw Sloane...

41:24.672 --> 41:27.327
I saw a prisoner...

41:29.275 --> 41:30.386
shackled.

41:34.717 --> 41:35.836
Syd...

41:40.113 --> 41:41.879
it's your mother.

41:44.700 --> 41:46.236
She's alive.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.436
