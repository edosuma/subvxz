01:34.128 --> 01:36.762
[man distorted] Get up!

01:36.764 --> 01:41.567
[referee] One... two... three

01:42.503 --> 01:47.539
four... five... six...

01:47.541 --> 01:50.642
["Let Me Call You Sweetheart"
playing]

02:24.778 --> 02:26.845
What made you fall in love
with an old man like me?

02:26.847 --> 02:30.883
-[sighs] I have no idea.
-[both laugh]

02:36.323 --> 02:37.456
We should turn in.

02:40.628 --> 02:41.693
All right.

02:42.463 --> 02:44.163
Early Stake Conference?

02:45.466 --> 02:46.732
President Smith's coming...

02:48.202 --> 02:51.770
-Right... that.
-Yeah.

02:51.772 --> 02:55.374
-Yeah.
-Okay.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.452
[indistinct chatter]

03:08.422 --> 03:09.521
[boys] Hey, champ!

03:22.636 --> 03:23.735
[President Smith] Willard Bean.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.527
Brother Willard Bean...

03:31.528 --> 03:33.478
Brother Willard Bean,
will you please
come to the stand?

03:43.857 --> 03:45.457
[inaudible conversation]

03:55.436 --> 03:56.835
[mouthing] What happened?

04:09.450 --> 04:12.251
What was that about
with President Smith?

04:12.253 --> 04:15.954
He needs to see us right now.
He mentioned something
about a mission.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.755
A mission!

04:17.757 --> 04:19.558
You've already been
on three missions,

04:19.560 --> 04:21.360
and we're just married!

04:21.362 --> 04:23.262
You're right.

04:23.264 --> 04:25.264
You be sure
and mention all of that
to the Prophet.

04:29.003 --> 04:31.303
[President Smith] It's so nice
to see you again, Willard,

04:31.305 --> 04:34.539
and Sister Bean,
it's wonderful to meet you.

04:34.541 --> 04:37.976
I was so pleased
to hear of your marriage.

04:37.978 --> 04:42.714
Now... here is what I wanted
to speak with you about.

04:42.716 --> 04:47.552
Eight years ago
the Church purchased
the Joseph Smith farm.

04:47.554 --> 04:51.456
We are just now
able to take possession of it.

04:51.458 --> 04:55.694
We need someone to live there
and take care of the farm

04:55.696 --> 04:59.464
and re-establish the Church
in that area.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.466
And when you stepped
through that door today,

05:01.468 --> 05:04.803
it was like a voice said to me,
"There's your man!"

05:06.573 --> 05:10.042
So I am extending a call
to you and Rebecca

05:10.044 --> 05:14.413
to serve as missionaries
and caretakers
for the Joseph Smith farm.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.817
In New York?

05:18.819 --> 05:21.653
I discussed it with the Twelve
and we agreed

05:21.655 --> 05:25.524
that it would be far too
expensive to move the farm
here.

05:35.069 --> 05:36.268
When would you like us to
leave?

05:36.269 --> 05:37.468
[President Smith] So,
you'll accept the call?

05:37.471 --> 05:39.905
-[Willard] Of course,
President.
-Wonderful.

05:41.408 --> 05:43.342
[Rebecca] And for how long
will we serve?

05:43.344 --> 05:46.812
[President Smith] I think
five years should do it.

05:46.814 --> 05:51.650
Now... this has been
a hostile area for us.

05:51.652 --> 05:54.886
So your job will be
to show them that
we are good folks

05:54.888 --> 05:58.857
and... we can fit into
their lovely community...

05:58.859 --> 06:03.528
as well as helping us
to secure other
precious Church history sites.

06:05.699 --> 06:09.000
[Willard] Thank you
for the trust, President.

06:09.002 --> 06:13.972
But it's been 85 years
since the Church left there.
[chuckles]

06:13.974 --> 06:15.640
All must be forgotten by now

06:15.642 --> 06:17.476
and surely can't be too bad.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.383
We heard you was coming.

06:27.554 --> 06:28.687
They heard we was coming!

06:34.027 --> 06:37.596
Brother and Sister Bean,
may God go with you.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.004
Excuse me, kind sir!

06:48.041 --> 06:51.176
Can you direct me
to the Joseph Smith farmhouse
on Stafford road?

07:05.959 --> 07:07.426
[tense music playing]

07:12.032 --> 07:13.031
[sighs]

07:15.502 --> 07:18.603
Well... he seems nice.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.605
Heeyah!

07:25.512 --> 07:26.945
You know, sweetheart,

07:26.947 --> 07:28.180
I may have to show these people

07:28.182 --> 07:29.881
a thing or two
to get 'em to accept us.

07:29.883 --> 07:32.551
Now let's not start with that.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.719
I'm just sayin'
people will respect a man

07:34.721 --> 07:36.154
who's willing to fight
what he believes in.

07:41.962 --> 07:47.599
Willard... were any
of Joseph and Emma's children
born in the Smith farmhouse?

07:48.936 --> 07:50.702
I don't know, sweetheart.
Why you ask?

07:50.704 --> 07:52.170
Oh, I just think
it would be fun to know.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.006
I can find out.

07:57.644 --> 08:00.178
Do you think they have
a good doctor here?

08:00.180 --> 08:02.147
I haven't been
feeling too well.

08:02.783 --> 08:06.051
Oh, I'm sorry.
You know what it is?

08:06.053 --> 08:09.855
It's all this travel.
It happens to me, too.

08:09.857 --> 08:12.557
Trust me, this has
never happened to you.

08:12.559 --> 08:14.659
[happy music playing]

08:18.198 --> 08:21.766
I think I'll have this
for another seven months or so.

08:35.282 --> 08:36.581
Whoa!

08:39.520 --> 08:42.520
Rebecca! Are you...?

08:43.991 --> 08:45.290
[laughs]

08:46.059 --> 08:47.092
Sweetheart!

08:51.832 --> 08:53.265
Yeehaw! [laughing]

08:57.170 --> 08:58.803
Our life. Yeah.

09:00.107 --> 09:03.208
Yeehaw! I love our life!
[laughs]

09:06.613 --> 09:07.612
Look at this.

09:15.656 --> 09:16.721
Well, there it is.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.127
[tongue clicking]

09:24.331 --> 09:26.298
Where angels talked
and prophets walked.

09:35.642 --> 09:36.808
[tongue clicking]

09:41.748 --> 09:46.017
-All right, dear, here you are.
-Thank you.

09:46.019 --> 09:48.687
-I'll go get the front door
for you.
-Okay.

09:49.756 --> 09:50.822
-You good?
-Uh-huh.

09:50.824 --> 09:52.157
I'll be right back to help you.

10:04.371 --> 10:05.904
[clears throat]

10:05.906 --> 10:08.673
Sweetheart, you know
what I forgot to do?

10:09.610 --> 10:12.110
I forgot to tell you
this morning how
beautiful you are.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.111
[Rebecca laughs]

10:16.883 --> 10:18.683
-Look at it.
-[sighs]

10:19.953 --> 10:21.886
We can do this.

10:21.888 --> 10:24.289
-I hope so.
-We'll be just fine.

10:24.758 --> 10:25.824
We will be.

10:25.826 --> 10:28.693
-I'll give it everything I have.
-All right.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.797
[Rebecca] Just be patient
with me...

10:34.034 --> 10:36.234
while I'll try
and make friends here.

10:36.236 --> 10:40.839
You will, dear,
you're wonderful.
All right, you ready?

10:54.221 --> 10:55.320
You can do this.

10:57.424 --> 10:58.823
I'll go take care of the rig.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.727
[dramatic music playing]

11:21.014 --> 11:22.047
[sighs]

11:28.822 --> 11:30.855
[Rebecca] Everything all right?

11:30.857 --> 11:33.058
It's wonderful, thank you.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.760
You know, with that seed money
we were given,

11:35.762 --> 11:38.229
we should be able
to get this farm
back on it's feet and running.

11:38.231 --> 11:39.264
[knocking on door]

11:41.168 --> 11:43.168
Well, circle the calendar...

11:43.170 --> 11:45.136
we just got here
and we already have
our first visitors.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.713
Gentlemen! Welcome! Come in.

11:58.185 --> 11:59.818
[tense music playing]

12:03.824 --> 12:05.457
All right.

12:05.459 --> 12:06.758
It'll be fine.

12:09.362 --> 12:10.395
[clears throat]

12:15.035 --> 12:17.736
Well, happy to make
your acquaintance,
good neighbor.

12:17.738 --> 12:19.270
My name is Willard Bean.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.806
We know who you are.

12:21.808 --> 12:24.776
We'll say our piece, Mr. Bean,
and be gone.

12:24.778 --> 12:29.447
As citizens of this community,
we had a meeting this evening.

12:29.449 --> 12:35.987
It is the feeling
of all who live here that
you are to leave Palmyra.

12:35.989 --> 12:39.891
We drove you out of here
years ago
and you're not coming back.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.893
So, you best be on your way.

12:44.164 --> 12:48.767
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

12:48.769 --> 12:52.070
So, we come out here
hoping to...
fit in with you good people

12:52.072 --> 12:54.439
and be an asset
to the community.

12:57.410 --> 13:02.313
We hold no ill feelings
for what your people did to us
80 years ago,

13:02.315 --> 13:04.816
though it was wrong
and always will be.

13:04.818 --> 13:05.817
[sighs]

13:06.953 --> 13:10.255
So... you listen to me.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.158
We are here to stay...

13:14.895 --> 13:17.829
even if we have to
fight our way.

13:17.831 --> 13:22.033
Now I could take you
one at a time or three at once,

13:22.035 --> 13:23.034
whatever makes you happier.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.407
Well, come on!

13:34.881 --> 13:37.816
-We'll be back!
-I'll be here.

13:43.089 --> 13:44.455
[men whispering indistinctly]

13:50.463 --> 13:55.366
Willard... do you think
you may have been
too bold maybe?

13:56.436 --> 13:58.503
What? No.

13:58.505 --> 14:01.940
Honey... [chuckles]
didn't you feel the love
just... [inhales]

14:01.942 --> 14:03.875
-flowing out of me?
-[laughs]

14:04.477 --> 14:05.844
Not really.

14:08.081 --> 14:10.582
[Willard humming]

14:33.874 --> 14:34.906
[Rebecca exclaims]

14:37.310 --> 14:38.443
Sweetheart, you all right?

14:38.445 --> 14:40.345
Yes, I just, um...

14:42.115 --> 14:43.514
do you need something, dear?

14:43.516 --> 14:45.550
I'm heading to town...

14:45.552 --> 14:47.652
probably be the better part
of the day into the night.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.487
So, it's best
you not wait up for me.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.523
Into the night?

14:55.195 --> 14:56.227
Sweetheart.

14:58.565 --> 15:02.066
You needn't worry.
We're being protected.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.210
-Love you.
-Love you.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.247
[door closes]

15:38.104 --> 15:39.137
[bell chimes]

15:39.139 --> 15:40.438
[indistinct chatter]

15:52.619 --> 15:53.618
Good day, gentlemen!

15:55.555 --> 15:58.323
I am in need of a part
for the singletree for my buggy

15:58.325 --> 16:00.158
and I was wondering
if you had any available?

16:06.499 --> 16:07.532
Any at all...

16:08.702 --> 16:09.968
[Willard scoffs]

16:14.674 --> 16:16.507
It seems like
such a simple question.

16:19.045 --> 16:22.480
Uh, we have those parts...

16:22.482 --> 16:25.550
but they're not for sale,
uh, at this particular time.

16:26.419 --> 16:29.020
Oh, all right.

16:29.022 --> 16:31.389
Can you give me some idea
as when the particular time
will be

16:31.391 --> 16:33.091
that they are available?

16:33.093 --> 16:36.294
Well... I suspect...

16:36.296 --> 16:39.597
it all hinges on...
who's wanting to buy 'em.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.534
[Willard laughs]

16:43.536 --> 16:46.771
As I mentioned,
I'm the one needing them,

16:46.773 --> 16:49.040
so I reckon
I'll be the one buying 'em.

16:50.577 --> 16:54.212
Well...
then they're not for sale.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.452
[tense music playing]

17:15.702 --> 17:20.171
Then I'll just purchase them
in Macedon today.

17:20.173 --> 17:23.174
Maybe they're not so particular
about who they
take their money from.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.486
And thanks for everything!

17:38.258 --> 17:40.124
[bell chimes]

17:40.126 --> 17:41.192
[door closes]

18:02.549 --> 18:06.517
[man] Hey, Mormon!
Seen any angels lately?
[laughing]

18:13.827 --> 18:18.162
I understand you Mormons
believe in baptism by
immersion.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.332
Yeah, we do!

18:21.334 --> 18:23.768
And we also believe
in the laying on of hands!

18:23.770 --> 18:25.269
[men exclaim]

18:33.379 --> 18:35.480
-Boogidy, boogidy!
-Go, go, go!

18:39.819 --> 18:41.185
Pleasure to meet ya, neighbor!

18:43.256 --> 18:44.522
Thanks for the baptism.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.204
[knocking on door]

19:08.781 --> 19:09.814
[knocking on door]

19:16.623 --> 19:18.756
Good evening, ma'am.

19:18.758 --> 19:21.893
We are ministers
and these ladies
are school teachers.

19:21.895 --> 19:24.529
We have just been
to a ministerial convention.

19:24.531 --> 19:26.597
We passed by Mormon Hill...

19:26.599 --> 19:28.499
and we thought we would drop in
and see this place

19:28.501 --> 19:30.701
and hear a bit about Joe Smith.

19:32.906 --> 19:34.205
Please come in.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.476
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.914
My husband is in town,

19:42.916 --> 19:44.549
but I would be
happy to share with you

19:44.551 --> 19:46.951
the story
of the Prophet Joseph Smith.

19:52.492 --> 19:56.727
This is the home
where the Prophet Joseph
brought the plates

19:56.729 --> 19:59.230
after receiving them
from the angel Moroni.

20:01.601 --> 20:02.934
[tense music playing]

20:05.238 --> 20:07.638
He was a liar and a cheat,
wasn't he?

20:08.908 --> 20:10.541
[shouting indistinctly]

20:13.513 --> 20:15.680
[Rebecca] They came as if
they wanted to learn...

20:15.682 --> 20:17.281
[shouting indistinctly]

20:17.283 --> 20:21.752
...but in reality they came
to taunt and hurt.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.793
I felt darkness
invade our home...

20:33.566 --> 20:36.834
it was thick...
and it had power.

20:39.606 --> 20:40.838
I began to pray for help.

20:46.746 --> 20:51.716
At that moment,
I felt the presence of someone
standing beside me...

20:54.354 --> 20:56.454
everyone in the room
fell silent.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.024
I bear testimony...

21:01.494 --> 21:03.728
that Joseph Smith
was a Prophet of God

21:07.033 --> 21:11.836
and I feel his presence
in this home... even now.

21:14.574 --> 21:17.575
Anyone who prayfully seeks
will know also.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.046
He taught as the Savior did...

21:23.349 --> 21:26.884
preaching love and forgiveness.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.544
Apologies for our actions,
ma'am.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.553
I felt the Prophet Joseph's
love...

22:05.458 --> 22:07.491
and that's what seemed
to turn them around.

22:08.594 --> 22:11.629
Dear... we are being protected.

22:27.480 --> 22:28.512
[whispering] That's her.

22:38.591 --> 22:39.623
[knocking on door]

22:42.729 --> 22:44.128
Pardon me, ma'am.

22:44.130 --> 22:46.997
I was told someone
in this house is a nurse.

22:46.999 --> 22:48.065
Would that be yourself?

22:49.769 --> 22:52.737
Lovely. I will be having
a child in a few months

22:52.739 --> 22:55.072
and I'm in need of a nurse
to assist me...

23:04.784 --> 23:06.984
[woman] Go back to Utah
where you belong!

23:13.826 --> 23:16.427
I know it would be
somewhat of a bother.

23:16.429 --> 23:18.696
I would take as little
of your time as possible,
but...

23:18.698 --> 23:20.798
I know who you are, Mrs. Bean.

23:24.137 --> 23:26.036
Nobody here is going to
help you.

23:27.807 --> 23:31.175
I did not train
in child delivery
to help a Mormon!

23:31.177 --> 23:34.578
-No!
-I can't tell you how happy
it would make me

23:34.580 --> 23:36.547
to know
that you would come and...

23:40.553 --> 23:41.952
[Rebecca crying]

23:43.723 --> 23:45.890
I think we're all alone.

23:45.892 --> 23:49.193
Sweetheart, we won't be.
We won't be.

23:49.195 --> 23:52.997
Shh! It'll be all right.

23:57.670 --> 24:01.172
[Rebecca] For our
many blessings we thank thee

24:01.174 --> 24:03.674
and acknowledge thy hand
in our lives.

24:05.044 --> 24:08.679
We pray that the way
may be opened for us

24:08.681 --> 24:10.714
to receive the help that we
need

24:10.716 --> 24:14.819
with the baby that we are
about to bring into this world.

24:14.821 --> 24:19.623
These blessings we ask for
in Jesus' name, Amen.

24:19.625 --> 24:20.691
Amen.

24:22.695 --> 24:23.761
Thank you.

24:32.672 --> 24:35.873
You know, it occurs to me...

24:35.875 --> 24:40.177
there is one possibility
for a mid-wife
we haven't even considered.

24:40.179 --> 24:41.812
Really? Who'd that be?

24:42.949 --> 24:43.981
[mouths] You.

24:45.017 --> 24:47.485
[scoffs] Becca...

24:47.487 --> 24:49.253
a man can't be there
when the baby is born!

24:49.255 --> 24:51.021
He can if there is no one else.

24:51.023 --> 24:52.890
[sighs]

24:52.892 --> 24:54.492
You can't do this for me?

24:56.229 --> 24:58.996
You've delivered horses
and calves before.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.832
[sighs] Sweetheart,
you're not a cow.

25:04.036 --> 25:05.636
Thank you for noticing, dear.

25:12.245 --> 25:16.847
[humming]

25:16.849 --> 25:22.653
-I'm in love with you...
-Moo!

25:25.024 --> 25:26.957
[knocking on door]

25:26.959 --> 25:29.093
Howdy, neighbor!
We're the Beans. We just--

25:31.697 --> 25:34.698
Wait a minute. Is that...

25:34.700 --> 25:36.600
Is this what
they've been doing to you?

25:36.602 --> 25:38.636
[knocking on door]

25:38.638 --> 25:41.138
Good morning, we are
Willard and Rebecca Bean...

25:44.110 --> 25:45.276
Well, that was uncalled for.

25:47.947 --> 25:48.746
That was uncalled for.

25:52.885 --> 25:53.918
Big tough guy!

25:57.256 --> 25:58.756
[cow mooing]

26:07.333 --> 26:09.900
Hey, Mormon!

26:09.902 --> 26:12.036
I been meaning to tell you,
what a gaul--

26:12.038 --> 26:13.103
[cow mooing]

26:13.105 --> 26:14.238
...Church you belong to.

26:15.875 --> 26:18.742
There's nothing worse
on this earth

26:18.744 --> 26:22.613
than an idiot Mormon...
and you can just take your--

26:22.615 --> 26:23.881
[cow mooing]

26:23.883 --> 26:26.684
...and your visions
and your glories

26:26.686 --> 26:28.819
and you can just
collect yourselves up

26:28.821 --> 26:33.057
-into a bright red sack
and head straight back to--
-[cow mooing]

26:33.059 --> 26:35.726
...and while you're there
why don't you make friends
with the devil.

26:35.728 --> 26:38.662
Because you and him,
you're gonna be around each
other for a long--

26:38.664 --> 26:39.730
[grunts]

26:44.904 --> 26:46.704
[mooing]

26:52.678 --> 26:55.145
[President Smith]
Brother Bean, please know that

26:55.147 --> 27:00.050
the First Presidency
and the Twelve
pray for you daily.

27:00.052 --> 27:04.288
Your mission is in the
forefront
of our minds.

27:04.290 --> 27:08.959
We are desirous of you
approaching those who own
the Hill Cumorah

27:08.961 --> 27:10.995
and asking their selling price.

27:23.843 --> 27:25.275
[Willard] Hey, good lookin'!

27:26.646 --> 27:28.779
You one of them Mormons?

27:28.781 --> 27:30.981
-Through and through.
-[laughs]

27:30.983 --> 27:32.883
Have you come to drive me away?

27:32.885 --> 27:34.218
Well, yes, I have.

27:34.220 --> 27:35.252
Get in.

27:37.223 --> 27:39.323
[playful music playing]

27:44.397 --> 27:46.797
-Where are you taking me?
-You'll see.

27:54.674 --> 27:56.974
Is it all right for us
to be here?

27:56.976 --> 28:00.010
I just thought it was time
that we visit the site

28:00.012 --> 28:03.947
that President Smith
wants us to purchase.

28:03.949 --> 28:07.117
But the current owner
may not be so pleased
about us being here.

28:07.119 --> 28:09.153
Oh, what do they care?

28:09.155 --> 28:11.789
They got better things to do
than worry about two
strangers--

28:11.791 --> 28:12.856
[gunshot]

28:13.826 --> 28:14.825
[man] Hey!

28:16.362 --> 28:17.428
Hey, you!

28:19.365 --> 28:20.431
What do you think you're doing?

28:21.834 --> 28:23.801
See? They don't mind.

28:23.803 --> 28:25.936
They already sent
their welcoming committee!

28:25.938 --> 28:30.107
-Are you those Mormons
moved into the old Smith place?
-[Willard] We are.

28:30.109 --> 28:32.309
We just wanted to walk
to the top of the hill
if that's all right.

28:32.311 --> 28:33.377
It ain't all right.

28:34.880 --> 28:37.047
It ain't even
close to all right.

28:37.049 --> 28:40.818
And there ain't no Mormon
gonna set foot
on this hill again...

28:41.821 --> 28:44.188
never!

28:44.190 --> 28:47.091
Now you need to climb back
in that ratty buggy of yours
and get on outta here

28:47.093 --> 28:50.160
before I do
some real damage to ya!

28:50.162 --> 28:52.830
All right,
we'll be on our way.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.232
First...

28:55.234 --> 28:59.236
I wanna thank you
for your warm welcome
to your friendly village.

28:59.238 --> 29:03.440
We had heard it was going to be
really difficult for us here,
but...

29:03.442 --> 29:07.111
well, you've renewed our hope
and faith in humanity, so...

29:09.215 --> 29:11.348
We're Willard and Rebecca Bean.

29:11.350 --> 29:12.950
Happy to be your new neighbors.

29:17.089 --> 29:18.088
Never!

29:19.925 --> 29:21.825
All right, well, Rebecca,
we should go,

29:21.827 --> 29:23.827
we shouldn't dilly dally
all day here

29:23.829 --> 29:26.063
in the good company
of this gentleman.

29:26.065 --> 29:28.866
Oh, neighbor... I don't think
I caught your name.

29:29.835 --> 29:30.868
Never!

29:35.107 --> 29:38.442
-Do you think "Never" is his
first name, or last name?
-[both laugh]

29:38.444 --> 29:39.543
It's hard to say.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.045
Idiot Mormons.

29:49.955 --> 29:51.221
[Rebecca] How do you do it?

29:53.959 --> 29:56.426
How can you remain
so positive...

29:56.428 --> 29:58.262
when everyone despises us?

29:59.165 --> 30:00.197
[chuckles]

30:01.834 --> 30:04.368
Practice.

30:04.370 --> 30:07.237
When you serve a mission
in the South in the 1890's,

30:07.239 --> 30:08.472
you have plenty of practice.

30:11.177 --> 30:13.577
Were they mean to you?

30:13.579 --> 30:16.880
Oh, not so much mean to me
as they were to the Elders
we replaced when we got there.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.283
What did they do to them?

30:20.386 --> 30:21.418
Killed them.

30:22.454 --> 30:23.487
Killed them dead?

30:28.360 --> 30:29.393
[glass landing on table]

30:32.431 --> 30:33.897
What did they do to you?

30:40.206 --> 30:43.373
[man] Get out of here, you
Mormons. Get out of here.

30:43.375 --> 30:47.945
[man] Show us a sign!
Show us a sign Mormon boys!
We want to see a sign.

30:48.614 --> 30:49.613
Lemme put it this way...

30:51.417 --> 30:53.417
You boys say
you got the true religion.

30:55.187 --> 30:56.553
Well, you better show us
a sign,

30:56.555 --> 30:58.088
or we're gonna show you a sign

30:58.090 --> 31:00.490
of some real nice
southern hospitality.

31:00.492 --> 31:03.026
[crowd shouting, laughing]

31:03.028 --> 31:06.563
All right, all right.
I will be more than happy
to oblige you with a sign.

31:08.467 --> 31:11.435
First... my companion,

31:11.437 --> 31:14.204
he hasn't been out here
very long, right.

31:14.206 --> 31:16.006
He's not used to
this sort of thing.

31:16.008 --> 31:20.944
So, would it be okay if we
sent him down the road a bit...

31:20.946 --> 31:24.147
and then I'll be happy
to show you boys a sign.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.050
-Okay.
-What'd ya say?

31:27.052 --> 31:29.219
All right, all right.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.088
Elder Tanner, you...
go ahead and make your way
down the road.

31:31.090 --> 31:32.990
I'll, I'll be right after you.

31:32.992 --> 31:34.024
I'll be right behind ya.

31:38.664 --> 31:39.897
[bird cawing]

31:40.666 --> 31:42.966
All right.

31:42.968 --> 31:46.236
[Willard] So...
it's very evident to me...

31:46.238 --> 31:50.007
that you are very well versed
in Bible and in the scriptures
because you know...

31:50.009 --> 31:51.174
that the Lord has shown...

31:51.911 --> 31:53.577
many signs.

31:53.579 --> 31:57.080
The sign I'm gonna show you
is...

31:57.082 --> 31:59.650
it's a heavenly sign...

31:59.652 --> 32:03.220
and it's a sign
that's been passed down
from time gone by.

32:07.326 --> 32:09.226
I...

32:09.228 --> 32:12.162
am gonna strike you blind.

32:12.164 --> 32:13.196
[man] What?

32:17.970 --> 32:19.403
[man] Whoa, whoa.

32:19.405 --> 32:23.273
[mob leader] Ow.
I can't see! I can't see!

32:23.275 --> 32:24.675
That's 'cuz you're blind!

32:24.677 --> 32:26.677
Run Elder! Run for your life!

32:26.679 --> 32:28.712
-[mob leader] I can't see!
-[man] Get those Mormons!

32:28.714 --> 32:31.081
[crowd shouting] Go, go. Go.

32:31.083 --> 32:32.516
[Tanner] Do you think
we can outrun 'em, Elder?

32:32.518 --> 32:34.518
[Willard laughs] I only
have to outrun you!

32:34.520 --> 32:36.253
Ooh. Wait, I'm kidding.

32:36.255 --> 32:38.588
-[gunshot]
-Wait, I'm your
senior companion.

32:38.590 --> 32:40.657
-You have to wait!
-[gunshot]

32:40.659 --> 32:42.292
-You didn't.
-I did.

32:42.294 --> 32:44.127
-You didn't.
-I did.

32:44.129 --> 32:46.964
I told my mission president,
J. Golden Kimball, I said,

32:46.966 --> 32:49.566
"I will turn the other cheek,
if they can hit the first one."

32:49.568 --> 32:51.468
[both laughing]

32:51.470 --> 32:54.037
[sighs] That's what I said.

32:54.039 --> 32:56.239
That's what we gotta do,
sweetheart. We just
gotta keep swinging.

32:56.241 --> 32:58.041
Just, just keep swinging.

32:59.745 --> 33:00.978
True story.

33:08.620 --> 33:09.653
[knocking on door]

33:11.557 --> 33:12.589
[Rebecca] I'll get it!

33:14.159 --> 33:15.225
[footsteps towards door]

33:18.530 --> 33:19.596
[door opening]

33:21.467 --> 33:23.333
[Rebecca] Hello.

33:23.335 --> 33:25.268
[Ethel Hack] Mrs. Bean,

33:25.270 --> 33:27.604
I understand that you
have been trying
to find someone

33:27.606 --> 33:29.573
to help with the delivery
of your baby.

33:30.676 --> 33:32.676
[Rebecca] That's right.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.177
[Ethel] I am not
a trained nurse

33:34.179 --> 33:36.446
but I have done some attending

33:36.448 --> 33:38.615
and I would be happy to assist.

33:40.652 --> 33:42.486
You know who we are, correct?

33:44.056 --> 33:46.356
I know you're good people.

33:46.358 --> 33:49.092
My brother was curious
about the Mormons

33:49.094 --> 33:51.428
and so he went to Utah
to see for himself.

33:53.399 --> 33:55.365
He enjoyed it so much
he moved there.

33:57.136 --> 33:59.603
And so here I am,

33:59.605 --> 34:01.738
happy as a lark
to help in any way.

34:03.208 --> 34:05.308
[Rebecca] Thank you so much.

34:05.310 --> 34:06.777
The baby is due any day now

34:06.779 --> 34:10.647
and we have a room upstairs
for you to stay in.

34:10.649 --> 34:13.750
[Ehtel] I'll just go back home
and pack my things
and be back this afternoon.

34:15.387 --> 34:17.054
Don't worry, Mrs. Bean,

34:18.724 --> 34:20.524
everything is going to be
just fine.

34:22.327 --> 34:23.527
Thank you so much.

34:24.530 --> 34:25.529
[Rebecca] Thank you.

34:31.637 --> 34:33.804
Willard!

34:33.806 --> 34:35.438
She's going to help me,
sweetheart.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.809
She's gonna help me.

34:38.811 --> 34:41.645
So does this mean
I don't get to be in with you
when you have the baby?

34:41.647 --> 34:43.213
No, Willard.

34:43.215 --> 34:44.414
She's going to help me.

34:46.385 --> 34:48.284
[mouths] Thank you.

34:48.286 --> 34:50.087
That is wonderful news...

34:50.755 --> 34:51.788
wonderful.

34:53.759 --> 34:55.391
-[birds chirping]
-[rooster crowing]

34:57.329 --> 34:59.396
[baby crying]

35:07.773 --> 35:09.606
[footsteps on stairs]

35:12.244 --> 35:14.678
Mr. Bean,

35:14.680 --> 35:18.348
you are the father
of a beautiful, healthy
baby girl.

35:19.885 --> 35:22.786
-I am?
-Yes, Sir.

35:22.788 --> 35:27.290
And I think it's about time
you two decided
on a name for her.

35:27.292 --> 35:28.758
Oh, we know her name.

35:28.760 --> 35:29.793
Her name is Palmyra.

35:33.298 --> 35:36.733
[Willard laughs] Look at her!
She's beautiful!

35:36.735 --> 35:38.368
She is beautiful!

35:47.713 --> 35:49.312
I'm ready, daddy!

35:49.314 --> 35:50.847
Yes you are.
You look beautiful!

35:50.849 --> 35:52.749
-[Palmyra laughing]
-Oh, there you go.

36:01.693 --> 36:04.461
I will see you cuties back here
in an hour.

36:04.463 --> 36:06.163
All right, dear.

36:06.165 --> 36:07.697
[dog barking]

36:07.699 --> 36:09.432
Come on Palmyra,

36:09.434 --> 36:11.501
-let's go buy some girl things.
-[Willard grunts]

36:11.503 --> 36:12.802
All right, ladies. Have fun.

36:14.239 --> 36:15.305
I'll see you later.

36:16.808 --> 36:18.508
[dog barking]

36:23.749 --> 36:24.848
Hello puppy!

36:25.817 --> 36:27.284
Hello little puppy!

36:28.820 --> 36:31.188
[Mrs. Rhodes] Stop!

36:31.190 --> 36:34.224
Don't you dare touch my dog.
Don't you ever
touch my dog again.

36:36.395 --> 36:39.696
I'd advise you to keep control
of your child, madam.

36:39.698 --> 36:42.899
No Mormon is ever allowed
to touch any dog in Palmyra.

36:45.837 --> 36:47.204
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

36:48.907 --> 36:51.241
She's not very happy, is she?

36:52.978 --> 36:55.278
We have a lot more animals
than she does.

36:58.250 --> 37:01.484
We'll let her pet our animals
if she ever comes to our place.

37:03.322 --> 37:04.854
Maybe that will make her happy.

37:06.325 --> 37:07.357
Yeah?

37:07.893 --> 37:08.925
Okay.

37:10.462 --> 37:11.528
Come on.

37:16.635 --> 37:18.735
[Willard] So, Mr. Sexton...

37:18.737 --> 37:20.904
what would you consider
a fair price for the hill now?

37:22.841 --> 37:24.374
I'd love to sell you
the hill...

37:25.444 --> 37:27.010
but it has to be on my terms.

37:28.280 --> 37:29.713
Of course,

37:29.715 --> 37:31.014
and what would that be?

37:31.016 --> 37:33.016
Same as before,

37:33.018 --> 37:34.684
one hundred thousand dollars.

37:36.488 --> 37:37.587
A hundred thousand.

37:39.458 --> 37:41.524
That is still too much
for my church to handle.

37:42.961 --> 37:44.561
We can do thirty-five.

37:44.563 --> 37:45.562
Hmm.

37:46.732 --> 37:48.765
I understand.

37:48.767 --> 37:51.968
You know I don't own
the entire hill.

37:51.970 --> 37:54.738
James Welch has
that smaller farm
on the west side.

37:55.807 --> 37:57.474
Have you met with him?

37:57.476 --> 37:59.009
Yes, we have.

37:59.011 --> 38:00.277
We call him "Never."

38:01.747 --> 38:04.514
Haven't heard him
called that before.

38:04.516 --> 38:08.718
Well... that's the way
he introduced himself to me...

38:08.720 --> 38:09.953
from the back end of a shotgun.

38:14.026 --> 38:16.793
Between he and me, Mr. Bean,

38:16.795 --> 38:19.062
it looks like you've got
your work cut out for you.

38:21.667 --> 38:22.799
Yeah, I suppose I do.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.806
But what happened
to make you so late?

38:30.709 --> 38:32.609
Did you get lost?

38:32.611 --> 38:34.611
I met with Mr. Sexton
and then I had to go

38:34.613 --> 38:36.813
all the way to Macedon
to get the part I needed.

38:38.617 --> 38:41.918
You mean they ran out of parts
in Palmyra again?

38:41.920 --> 38:43.720
No, they ran out of manners
again.

38:48.794 --> 38:50.794
Is there something going on
at the Hill tonight?

38:52.831 --> 38:53.863
[Willard] Haven't you seen
that before?

38:54.633 --> 38:55.665
Nope.

38:56.335 --> 38:58.001
Nope.

38:58.003 --> 38:59.069
Yeah, they're digging up
the hill.

39:00.806 --> 39:03.473
They're looking for gold.

39:03.475 --> 39:05.475
They dig even though
they don't believe?

39:06.945 --> 39:08.011
They believe in gold.

39:10.916 --> 39:12.048
[indistinct conversation]

39:12.050 --> 39:13.683
It looks pretty.

39:16.621 --> 39:17.854
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

39:23.929 --> 39:25.428
[children talking]

39:28.567 --> 39:30.100
Excuse me.

39:30.102 --> 39:31.868
I'm Rebecca Bean

39:31.870 --> 39:34.537
-and this--
-Yes, we've, um,

39:34.539 --> 39:35.572
been expecting you.

39:37.142 --> 39:38.675
And your name is?

39:39.578 --> 39:40.643
Palmyra.

39:45.884 --> 39:46.916
Don't worry.

39:47.919 --> 39:49.018
You'll make friends soon.

39:50.555 --> 39:51.621
This will be fine.

40:16.014 --> 40:17.847
Class! Take your seats, please.

40:22.154 --> 40:24.154
Thank you.

40:24.156 --> 40:27.424
We have a new student
in our class this year.

40:28.160 --> 40:29.959
Her name is Palmyra.

40:29.961 --> 40:32.495
[laughing] And my name
is Chicago!

40:32.497 --> 40:33.563
[children laughing]

40:35.133 --> 40:36.633
Take your seat please, dear.

41:22.147 --> 41:24.147
[Mildred Dewey] Now, class,

41:24.149 --> 41:26.783
there is much to cover
this year.

41:26.785 --> 41:30.153
You first graders are going to
have to work very hard
to keep up.

41:31.857 --> 41:33.723
It won't be easy

41:33.725 --> 41:36.192
-but it will be well
worth the effort.
-[chair moving]

41:39.197 --> 41:43.600
Every day I will expect you
to come back
with your homework prepared,

41:43.602 --> 41:46.870
all your T's crossed,
all your I's dotted.

41:46.872 --> 41:50.807
And always, of course,
it's very important you stay
in your assigned seats

41:50.809 --> 41:53.109
and that you follow
our class rules.

41:55.013 --> 41:58.114
Now, who can tell me,

41:58.116 --> 42:02.118
what is the newest state
in The United States
of America?

42:07.792 --> 42:08.825
Who knows?

42:09.761 --> 42:10.793
Who knows?

42:11.696 --> 42:12.729
June.

42:13.532 --> 42:15.164
Uh, Opalohma.

42:18.169 --> 42:19.202
No.

42:21.273 --> 42:22.305
Eldon?

42:24.709 --> 42:28.244
-Ummm....
-No, that's not it.

42:28.246 --> 42:29.946
[children laughing]

42:32.984 --> 42:35.585
-Columbia?
-Arizona?

42:35.587 --> 42:37.186
Very good, Columbia.

42:37.188 --> 42:39.088
[Mildred] Now,

42:39.090 --> 42:41.591
Arizona became the 48th state

42:41.593 --> 42:44.227
of the United States
of America on Valentines day...

42:44.996 --> 42:46.029
[birds chirping]

42:54.673 --> 42:56.706
[man] Ma'am?

42:56.708 --> 42:57.941
Looks like you could use
a little help.

43:05.850 --> 43:06.883
Ma'am.

43:08.086 --> 43:09.118
[Rebecca] Thank you.

43:11.022 --> 43:13.990
My husband's away
working hard himself and...

43:13.992 --> 43:16.759
having enough wood
for the kitchen can sometimes

43:16.761 --> 43:18.227
get left behind.

43:18.229 --> 43:19.896
Oh, I've never been afraid
of hard work.

43:22.100 --> 43:24.300
I also know a little something
about being hated...

43:26.271 --> 43:27.303
even before...

43:28.940 --> 43:30.206
people get a chance to know ya.

43:39.317 --> 43:41.684
I have a piece
of fresh baked pie

43:41.686 --> 43:44.187
right there in the kitchen.

43:44.189 --> 43:46.222
I'll be right back
with a proper thank you.

43:47.225 --> 43:48.157
You're good people.

43:52.831 --> 43:55.765
[Rebecca] You're so kind
to give your help.

43:55.767 --> 43:58.301
I don't mind the work
I have to do, but...

43:58.303 --> 44:01.638
firewood is harder for me
than most of my other chores.

44:03.074 --> 44:05.375
Now you just hold for a bit
while you...

44:40.945 --> 44:44.180
[children talking]

44:44.182 --> 44:48.184
We will begin this morning
by reviewing
our multiplication tables.

44:49.354 --> 44:51.921
One times seven is...

44:51.923 --> 44:53.756
[all children together] Seven.

44:53.758 --> 44:55.858
Two times seven is...

44:55.860 --> 44:58.061
[all children together]
Fourteen.

44:58.063 --> 45:00.063
Three times seven is...

45:00.065 --> 45:01.731
[all children together]
Twenty-one.

45:01.733 --> 45:03.399
Four times seven is...

45:03.401 --> 45:04.967
[all children together]
Twenty-eight.

45:17.816 --> 45:20.116
Five times seven is...

45:20.118 --> 45:22.785
[all children together]
Thirty-five.

45:22.787 --> 45:25.121
[Mildred] Six times seven is...

45:25.123 --> 45:27.390
[all children together]
Forty-two.

45:27.392 --> 45:30.059
[Mildred] Seven times seven
is...

45:30.061 --> 45:31.728
[all children together]
Forty-nine.

45:31.730 --> 45:34.063
[Mildred] Eight times seven
is...

45:34.065 --> 45:35.465
[all children together]
Fifty-six.

46:26.885 --> 46:28.818
[Elder Gates] Sister Bean?

46:28.820 --> 46:31.487
I'm Elder Crawford Gates
and this is Elder David Adams.

46:31.489 --> 46:34.123
And Elder Bob Bitner
and Elder Gordon Hinckley.

46:34.125 --> 46:37.326
We've just finished
our missions
and are on our way home.

46:37.328 --> 46:39.028
Would it be possible
to spend the evening here

46:39.030 --> 46:42.098
before we catch our train
tomorrow in Rochester?

46:42.100 --> 46:44.534
Certainly, Elders.
You're welcome to stay.

46:44.536 --> 46:47.036
Why don't you leave
your suitcases

46:47.038 --> 46:50.540
and I can have our daughter
take you out
to the Sacred Grove

46:50.542 --> 46:51.541
while I make your rooms ready.

46:52.544 --> 46:54.343
Palmyra!

46:54.345 --> 46:56.145
We have Elders to take care of!

47:01.419 --> 47:02.585
Hello, Elders.

47:12.430 --> 47:14.463
[Palmyra] This is
the Sacred Grove.

47:16.534 --> 47:18.601
Lots of these trees
were here then...

47:20.171 --> 47:21.537
but they're older now.

47:24.342 --> 47:26.843
We don't know
right where he prayed,

47:26.845 --> 47:28.311
but somewhere close by.

47:31.850 --> 47:35.017
So Heavenly Father and Jesus
were here, too...

47:35.920 --> 47:36.953
and talked to him...

47:38.623 --> 47:40.489
and told him what he should do.

47:53.438 --> 47:57.240
I think it was a good thing
that Joseph Smith
prayed here...

47:58.142 --> 47:59.175
don't you?

48:02.113 --> 48:03.145
Yes...

48:05.516 --> 48:06.616
it was a very good thing.

48:12.891 --> 48:15.291
[Elder Gates] Thank you
for the tour, Palmyra.

48:15.293 --> 48:18.060
You did such a wonderful job...

48:18.062 --> 48:21.063
I would like to give you...
this.

48:30.375 --> 48:32.541
Is this a nickel?

48:32.543 --> 48:34.243
Yeah! A whole nickel.

48:35.246 --> 48:38.414
Thank you... but...

48:38.416 --> 48:40.283
can I have a dime instead?

48:44.255 --> 48:45.454
A nickel isn't enough?

48:45.456 --> 48:47.189
Well...

48:47.191 --> 48:50.092
I don't know how to pay
my tithing with a nickel,

48:50.094 --> 48:51.594
but I can with a dime.

48:54.299 --> 48:55.298
Try this.

49:07.211 --> 49:09.278
[Elder Gates] Sister Bean,
did you know you're famous?

49:09.280 --> 49:10.947
The word is out
in all the missions,

49:10.949 --> 49:12.248
"Don't go home
until you've had a meal

49:12.250 --> 49:14.350
from Sister Bean
at the Smith Farm."

49:14.352 --> 49:16.652
This is the best food I've had
since leaving home.

49:16.654 --> 49:18.988
There must be so many
who come here.

49:18.990 --> 49:19.989
How do you do it?

49:26.731 --> 49:27.730
Elders...

49:31.102 --> 49:34.070
I have something
to share with you
regarding your question.

49:36.274 --> 49:38.140
There was a hot summer day

49:38.142 --> 49:39.675
and we had had
a lot of visitors.

49:41.012 --> 49:42.311
We'd just had Alvin

49:42.313 --> 49:44.380
and I had to carry him
most the day

49:44.382 --> 49:46.315
just to get my work done.

49:46.317 --> 49:47.750
[baby crying]

49:47.752 --> 49:50.453
The Apostle, Elder Talmage,
was here

49:50.455 --> 49:52.688
and we'd had
a wonderful evening

49:52.690 --> 49:57.159
but I was so exhausted,
I was in tears

49:57.161 --> 49:59.128
and I still had much
to be done.

50:04.435 --> 50:06.736
Everyone was in bed and asleep
but me.

50:09.507 --> 50:11.107
Finally I got ready for bed.

50:14.112 --> 50:16.412
I was crying about my hardships

50:16.414 --> 50:21.150
when this dream or...
vision came to me.

50:21.152 --> 50:22.585
[knocking on door]

50:22.587 --> 50:24.186
[door opening]

50:24.188 --> 50:25.454
[Rebecca] There was a knock
at the door

50:27.658 --> 50:30.259
and a very handsome young man
was standing there.

50:32.430 --> 50:35.664
I just knew he was
another missionary
that had come to see us.

50:42.473 --> 50:46.475
He and Elder Talmage
seemed so happy
to see each other...

50:46.477 --> 50:49.211
and talked about
wonderful things
while they were eating.

50:51.049 --> 50:54.183
The spirit was so peaceful...

50:54.185 --> 50:56.452
and they seemed so happy
to be together.

51:00.825 --> 51:04.460
After the meal,
I put Alvin to bed

51:04.462 --> 51:06.395
and went and talked alone
with the young man.

51:08.533 --> 51:11.700
He told me how sweet
and well behaved
my children were

51:13.471 --> 51:14.837
and I was so happy about that.

51:19.644 --> 51:21.110
He walked into the hall...

51:24.115 --> 51:25.848
and as I went
to wish him goodbye...

51:29.587 --> 51:31.687
it was the Savior
that stood before me...

51:34.492 --> 51:35.691
in all his glory.

51:40.531 --> 51:42.198
I couldn't tell you the love

51:44.102 --> 51:46.469
and the sweetness
that he had in his face.

51:50.775 --> 51:53.542
He said, "Sister Bean,

51:54.812 --> 51:57.847
if you go about your work
every day

51:59.317 --> 52:00.683
as you have done this day,

52:02.153 --> 52:03.519
you will be equal to it.

52:06.624 --> 52:10.459
Remember these missionaries
represent me on this earth,

52:13.664 --> 52:15.231
and all that you give
unto them,

52:16.667 --> 52:17.833
you give unto me."

52:21.706 --> 52:23.772
Elders, you ask me
how I can do it,

52:25.243 --> 52:26.308
day after day,

52:27.311 --> 52:28.544
and year after year.

52:30.515 --> 52:31.780
How can I not do it?

52:35.219 --> 52:36.352
I know who you are.

52:38.923 --> 52:40.422
And all that I do for you...

52:43.227 --> 52:44.293
I do for Him.

53:45.423 --> 53:47.323
Hey, Palmyra, you wanna play?

53:47.925 --> 53:48.958
[Palmyra] Okay.

53:50.528 --> 53:53.495
-[Palmyra grunting]
-[children laughing]

54:23.961 --> 54:25.394
Everything all right, dear?

54:27.932 --> 54:30.299
In town, I heard
Mr. Sexton died.

54:30.301 --> 54:34.003
-Oh, no.
-Yeah.

54:34.005 --> 54:37.539
With him gone, I don't know
if we'll ever be able
to obtain all of Cumorah.

54:39.277 --> 54:41.910
His heirs,
they hate the Church.

54:41.912 --> 54:43.779
Pledged they'd never sell
at any price.

54:46.984 --> 54:50.519
Maybe it's time to stand aside
and...

54:50.521 --> 54:51.787
let the Lord take it from here.

54:55.326 --> 54:56.892
Yeah.

54:56.894 --> 54:57.960

55:01.699 --> 55:02.765
Palmyra?

55:03.701 --> 55:04.767
Is that you?

55:07.772 --> 55:09.371
[Palmyra sobbing]

55:09.373 --> 55:10.706
Honey, what happened?

55:12.076 --> 55:14.376
Nobody likes me.

55:14.378 --> 55:15.978
Oh, sweetie. I'm sorry.

55:18.082 --> 55:20.983
[Palmyra] Why can't somebody
just be nice to me?

55:20.985 --> 55:22.584
[Rebecca] Oh, my little angel.

55:27.091 --> 55:29.425
I'm so sorry
we've done this to you.

55:31.696 --> 55:34.496
I don't have
any friends either.

55:34.498 --> 55:38.734
I just have Daddy
and I have Alvin...
and I have you.

55:38.736 --> 55:41.837
But I don't have
anybody to play with.

55:41.839 --> 55:43.472
Oh, sweetie.

55:45.643 --> 55:48.577
These are good people.

55:48.579 --> 55:52.448
We just have to give them time
to know that we're
good people, too.

55:53.818 --> 55:55.884
We just need
to keep being nice.

55:55.886 --> 55:57.853
I'm sick of being nice.

55:57.855 --> 55:58.954
[Rebecca] Oh.

56:03.461 --> 56:07.496
There was another little child
that used to live in this house

56:07.498 --> 56:09.098
who didn't have
any friends either.

56:10.568 --> 56:12.067
Do you know who I mean?

56:12.069 --> 56:14.536
-Joseph Smith?
-That's right.

56:16.807 --> 56:19.441
And he just kept
trying and trying.

56:20.544 --> 56:23.045
Yeah, and then they killed him.

56:24.949 --> 56:26.849
That's right...

56:26.851 --> 56:28.684
-but not you.
-[Palmyra sniffling]

Oh.

[thuds]

56:55.880 --> 56:58.580
[referee] One, two...

56:59.183 --> 57:00.015
three...

57:04.021 --> 57:05.053
Willard?

57:07.191 --> 57:08.891
[rooster crowing]

57:11.929 --> 57:12.961
Willard!

57:16.834 --> 57:17.866
Willard.

57:23.140 --> 57:25.441
Willard. Did you hear me?

57:26.544 --> 57:27.609
Oh, sorry.

57:31.081 --> 57:33.615
Yeah, we've been here six years
and they still hate us.

57:35.953 --> 57:37.586
I'm trying to do everything
that's right and...

57:38.989 --> 57:40.022
maybe I'm doing
something wrong.

57:45.463 --> 57:46.495
I don't know.

57:50.601 --> 57:52.768
Maybe it's time to do
what you do best.

57:54.138 --> 57:55.170
Irritate you?

57:58.042 --> 57:59.141
Put out a challenge.

57:59.977 --> 58:01.743
Right.

58:01.745 --> 58:03.979
Challenge the entire town
to join the Church?

58:03.981 --> 58:05.013
No.

58:07.485 --> 58:08.684
To get in the ring with you.

58:09.186 --> 58:10.486
Really?

58:14.925 --> 58:15.958
Really?

58:21.098 --> 58:22.631
Maybe we'll make some friends.

58:29.206 --> 58:33.242
[upbeat music playing]

58:33.244 --> 58:36.111
This is going to be perfect.
This is exactly
what we're going to need.

58:36.113 --> 58:39.147
-Are you going to have an issue
with...
-Not at all, thank you.

58:41.752 --> 58:43.752
[upbeat music playing]

58:52.563 --> 58:53.962
Afternoon.

58:53.964 --> 58:56.865
I'd like 50 copies of that.

58:56.867 --> 58:59.635
How are you? Come and see
the Mormon get beat up.
Here you go.

59:00.538 --> 59:01.603
Hope you come!

59:04.608 --> 59:06.608
Come watch my dad
beat up people.

59:08.846 --> 59:09.845
Hi.

59:10.281 --> 59:12.080
...

59:12.950 --> 59:13.949
Have a good day.

59:14.585 --> 59:15.651
Here.

59:34.204 --> 59:36.104
Good job, honey.
...

59:59.029 --> 01:00:01.096
Sweetheart.

01:00:01.098 --> 01:00:04.366
One thing I was thinking about
with your boxing exhibition...

01:00:04.368 --> 01:00:06.301
Mmm-hmm.

01:00:06.303 --> 01:00:08.670
...you know you're
slightly older now.

01:00:09.073 --> 01:00:10.706
Mmm-hmm.

01:00:10.708 --> 01:00:12.307
Before you get back
in the ring again,

01:00:13.744 --> 01:00:15.677
you may want to do
a little exercising?

01:00:17.948 --> 01:00:18.981
Just a thought.

01:00:20.985 --> 01:00:23.885
Time just...
has a way of slowing us down.

01:00:27.124 --> 01:00:28.256
Whatever you think's best.

01:00:33.664 --> 01:00:35.664
[upbeat music playing]

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:53.849
-[panting]
-Drink it.

01:00:55.085 --> 01:00:56.218
-Drink it?
-Yes.

01:00:57.087 --> 01:00:58.253
Mommy...

01:00:59.189 --> 01:01:01.323
Don't be scared.

01:01:01.325 --> 01:01:04.226
-Mmm... Oh...
-Yay.

01:01:04.228 --> 01:01:05.227
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:19.007
Very good. That's it.

01:01:19.009 --> 01:01:20.742
-That's it!
-Willard!

01:01:25.449 --> 01:01:26.682
You know, we were just playin'.

01:01:32.923 --> 01:01:34.289
Whoo-hoo!

-[continues hooting]

01:01:36.794 --> 01:01:37.793
Hey!

01:01:39.096 --> 01:01:41.396
I told you to git!

01:01:41.398 --> 01:01:44.800
-Get on out of here,
you idiot Mormon!
-Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no!

[Rebecca]
Please be careful, dear.

01:01:59.817 --> 01:02:01.717
I'll be careful
not to hurt 'em too badly.

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:05.187
I certainly hope this works

01:02:06.090 --> 01:02:07.889
and we make some friends.

01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:10.058
All right.
Well, the show must go on.

01:02:15.499 --> 01:02:18.767
All right. All right, all
right!

Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your attendance.

01:02:21.205 --> 01:02:22.738
I am Willard Bean.

01:02:24.842 --> 01:02:26.942

as "the idiot Mormon."

[crowd chuckling]

01:02:28.946 --> 01:02:31.046
But I am also known
as "The Fighting Preacher."

01:02:31.048 --> 01:02:33.315
-[crowd laughing]
-[man] Yeah, we'll see.

01:02:33.317 --> 01:02:35.217
The rules of the event tonight

01:02:35.219 --> 01:02:38.487
are those of
the Amateur Boxing Association.

winner by knockout,

otherwise a draw.

01:02:43.794 --> 01:02:47.863
All right...
let's get this started.
Who's our first challenger?

-[man] Buster!

applauding]

How are you, good sir?
What's your name?

01:03:02.813 --> 01:03:04.479
Buster.

01:03:04.481 --> 01:03:07.415
Buster. Buster, did you come
with anybody tonight?

01:03:09.787 --> 01:03:11.353
All right.

01:03:11.355 --> 01:03:14.790
Boys, you stay seated
till I give you this sign.

01:03:17.861 --> 01:03:19.327
All right? Got it?

01:03:21.832 --> 01:03:24.466
Perfect. Ready to get started?
All right.

01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:31.473
[woman] Let's go, let's go.

01:03:37.114 --> 01:03:38.947
Go Daddy!

[cheering]

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:54.963
Buster, get him! Hit him!

01:03:56.033 --> 01:03:59.100
[crowd] Oh! Oh!

01:03:59.102 --> 01:04:00.435

[laughs] I remember you.

01:04:37.908 --> 01:04:40.175
Just here for some
good old fashioned fun.

01:04:40.177 --> 01:04:44.145
Uh... [chuckles] Hopefully,
there'll be no offense.

01:04:44.147 --> 01:04:46.615
[grunts and groans]

01:04:46.617 --> 01:04:49.351
-[crowd gasping]
-None taken.

01:04:49.353 --> 01:04:54.256
You know, for me,
boxing's a very Christian
sport.

01:04:54.258 --> 01:04:57.459
I give much more than I
receive.
[chuckles]

01:04:58.896 --> 01:05:00.161
All right, who's next?

01:05:02.432 --> 01:05:06.201

-You look good, hun.

01:05:06.203 --> 01:05:08.603

[crowd jeering]

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:27.015
Oh, looks like we're
out of challengers. Anyone
else?

-Anyone?
-[man] Mormon show off.

01:06:29.119 --> 01:06:30.552
Thank you for your attendance!

01:06:30.554 --> 01:06:32.620
I hope you enjoyed
the Fighting Preacher show.

[crowd booing and complaining]

01:06:48.105 --> 01:06:51.106
Just because you're
a good fighter,
doesn't make you a good man.

01:06:55.379 --> 01:06:56.444
[groans]

01:06:58.115 --> 01:06:59.714
You're no preacher.

01:07:13.497 --> 01:07:15.463
Well, golly, that was a
success.

01:07:20.437 --> 01:07:23.438
[panting]

01:07:26.443 --> 01:07:27.742

01:07:29.613 --> 01:07:32.047
I don't know what else to do.

01:07:32.049 --> 01:07:34.349
[sighs] Maybe we should just
throw in the towel,

01:07:37.154 --> 01:07:38.219
go home.

01:07:39.823 --> 01:07:41.089
Daddy,

01:07:42.159 --> 01:07:44.225
maybe you should just be nice.

01:07:46.196 --> 01:07:48.096
Be nice?

01:07:48.098 --> 01:07:50.331
That's what Mommy always says.

01:07:53.603 --> 01:07:56.438
Maybe sometimes,

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.440
the best way to fight
is with love.

01:08:05.382 --> 01:08:06.748
[referee's voice echoing] One,

Are you all right, lad?

01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:43.585
Not looking good, Mr. Bean.

01:08:43.587 --> 01:08:45.420
I'm going to have to
call the fight.

01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:49.858
No. No, no. [panting] I got it.

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:53.361
I got it. I just...
I gotta change tactics.

01:08:53.363 --> 01:08:55.729
[panting] I'll do it.

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:58.233
I'm fine.

01:09:18.287 --> 01:09:19.854
You and Palmyra
are exactly right.

01:09:23.393 --> 01:09:25.593
My approach to what we're doing
back here is...

01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:28.429
It needs an adjustment.

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:31.899
We're gonna change tactics,

01:09:34.504 --> 01:09:35.770
we're gonna do the Savior's
way,

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:40.575
-we will...

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:43.845

Thanks for listening.

01:09:47.951 --> 01:09:49.884
[chuckles softly] Good talk.

01:09:56.793 --> 01:09:59.561
Sweetheart, I have an idea.

01:10:05.735 --> 01:10:07.969
This should be ready.

01:10:07.971 --> 01:10:12.273
Oh, boy. It's beautiful.
Let's put this on the table.

01:10:12.275 --> 01:10:13.341
All right.

01:10:14.444 --> 01:10:15.610
Thank you, sweetheart.

01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:18.913
Oh, and don't get shot.

01:10:18.915 --> 01:10:20.782
-Yes, dear.
-[door closes]

01:10:23.887 --> 01:10:26.287
Can't you get it through
your thick skull?

01:10:28.225 --> 01:10:30.625
No Mormons on this hill.

01:10:30.627 --> 01:10:33.461
Now, unless you made a recent
change in your religion,
that means you.

01:10:35.532 --> 01:10:37.999
Silly me. I forgot. [grunts]

01:10:39.336 --> 01:10:41.269
Thanks for the reminder.

01:10:41.271 --> 01:10:42.370
I said "never."

01:10:46.009 --> 01:10:47.408
Do you like pie?

01:10:49.713 --> 01:10:50.778
What kind of pie?

01:10:52.315 --> 01:10:53.381
Apple.

01:10:55.418 --> 01:10:57.018
Maybe. Now git!

01:10:59.823 --> 01:11:03.258
It's still warm. It's all
yours.

01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:04.525
From the missus.

01:11:15.572 --> 01:11:16.704
Good to see you, neighbor.

01:11:25.415 --> 01:11:27.682
Know that he recognizes
your struggles,

01:11:28.585 --> 01:11:29.751
and loves you,

01:11:31.821 --> 01:11:33.454
and is there for you...

01:11:44.934 --> 01:11:46.334
Mrs. Rhodes?

01:11:49.639 --> 01:11:52.340
-Mrs. Rhodes?
-[muffled] Who is it?

01:11:55.612 --> 01:11:58.446
-It's Rebecca Bean.
-Who?

01:11:58.448 --> 01:12:02.083
Rebecca Bean...
from over on Stafford Road.

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:06.587
Come in. I'm upstairs.

01:12:12.462 --> 01:12:13.628
Mrs. Rhodes,

01:12:14.831 --> 01:12:16.698
I'm told you're not doing well.

01:12:17.734 --> 01:12:19.067
Not so good.

01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:22.870
I brought you some potato soup.

01:12:22.872 --> 01:12:26.441
Oh... you darling.

01:12:30.847 --> 01:12:34.749
Uh... how do I know you?

01:12:35.552 --> 01:12:36.617
You know,

01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:39.020
I live at the Smith farm

01:12:39.989 --> 01:12:41.522
over on Stafford Road.

01:12:43.426 --> 01:12:44.859
I love to make soup.

01:12:46.896 --> 01:12:49.030
My mother used to say,

01:12:49.032 --> 01:12:51.532
"Soup heals the body
and the soul."

01:13:00.143 --> 01:13:03.745
Mmm... that's lovely.

01:13:07.917 --> 01:13:09.851
-[Willard] Have a good day.
-Well, thanks.

01:13:09.853 --> 01:13:11.719
-Here, squash.
-Thank you.

01:13:11.721 --> 01:13:13.621
- Have some beans?
-Thank you.

01:13:13.623 --> 01:13:15.990
Have a good day.
I have some beans for you.

01:13:15.992 --> 01:13:17.392
Have a great day.

01:13:17.394 --> 01:13:18.926
-Nice to meet you.
-So nice.

01:13:33.143 --> 01:13:35.943
That was a nasty wind.
[chuckles]

01:13:35.945 --> 01:13:37.979
Any other damage around here
I can help you with?

01:13:37.981 --> 01:13:39.046
What are you doing?

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:41.916
Mending fences.

01:13:51.661 --> 01:13:53.561
[knocking at door]

01:13:53.563 --> 01:13:54.662
[Betty Sue] Come in.

01:14:03.706 --> 01:14:05.039
Mrs. Webster?

01:14:07.210 --> 01:14:10.812
I'm volunteering
with the Red Cross.

01:14:10.814 --> 01:14:13.014
I'd like to help you
and your new baby.

01:14:16.786 --> 01:14:17.785
[sniffles]

01:14:19.589 --> 01:14:20.588
Come in.

01:14:24.127 --> 01:14:25.493
[Rebecca] Hi.

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:35.169
I've come to offer
a gift of clothing

01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:40.007
and to help you
in any way that I can.

01:14:45.748 --> 01:14:47.982
I hope this will make
your baby feel better.

01:14:52.956 --> 01:14:54.555
You've been here before.

01:14:56.059 --> 01:14:57.892
Do you remember me, Mrs. Bean?

01:14:58.862 --> 01:15:00.495
Yes, Mrs. Webster.

01:15:02.665 --> 01:15:04.565
I'm happy to see you again.

01:15:07.570 --> 01:15:09.237
I'm happy to see you, too.

01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:21.616
Mr. Bean? I am Charles Collins,
this is my wife, Maude.

01:15:21.618 --> 01:15:24.552
We'd like to speak with you.
May we come in?

01:15:25.555 --> 01:15:26.621
Please.

01:15:28.224 --> 01:15:30.725
Nice to meet you.
I've seen you around.

01:15:32.595 --> 01:15:34.095
Through the laying on of hands,

01:15:34.097 --> 01:15:36.564
the Lord wants you to know
that he loves you.

01:15:36.566 --> 01:15:39.133
And although it seems
at times hard to see,

01:15:40.904 --> 01:15:42.169
he's never going away.

01:15:43.806 --> 01:15:46.941
I bless you with health
and with strength

01:15:46.943 --> 01:15:49.877
that your body may respond
to those treatments
that have been given you,

01:15:49.879 --> 01:15:52.713
that you may find happiness
in the meantime,

01:15:52.715 --> 01:15:55.583
that all might be well,

01:15:55.585 --> 01:15:57.552
that you might feel
the presence
of your Heavenly Father

01:15:57.554 --> 01:15:58.619
helping you through this.

01:15:59.856 --> 01:16:03.991
[children chattering
and laughing]

01:16:20.977 --> 01:16:23.644
You make the best soups,
Mrs. Bean.

01:16:29.052 --> 01:16:31.886
Mrs. Rhodes,

01:16:31.888 --> 01:16:35.189
did you ever have any trouble
with your children at school?

01:16:39.028 --> 01:16:42.063
Oh, just the same as
everybody else, I guess.

01:16:46.269 --> 01:16:49.136
Some of the children
giving your girl some problems?

01:16:54.377 --> 01:16:56.711
For sure she can't be mean
back to them.

01:17:00.683 --> 01:17:02.750
We're all going through
the same things.

01:17:04.621 --> 01:17:06.687
It seems to me,

01:17:06.689 --> 01:17:08.656
nothing's as good as
treating others

01:17:08.658 --> 01:17:10.191
the way you'd
like to be treated.

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:12.760
The golden rule.

01:17:22.105 --> 01:17:25.339
[softly] Though...
be so careful.

01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:28.709
Well, what are you two up to?

01:17:28.711 --> 01:17:31.045
Mommy's helping me be nice.

01:17:31.047 --> 01:17:34.915
Be nice? Sweetheart,
are they still being
mean to you at school?

01:17:38.054 --> 01:17:41.789
Honey, I will show you...
a left hook

01:17:41.791 --> 01:17:43.824
that will teach them
a thing or two. Come with me.

01:17:45.094 --> 01:17:48.396
Come on. Come on. What?

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:53.067
Oh, right.

01:17:53.069 --> 01:17:55.836
Okay, well, you two carry on.

01:18:17.727 --> 01:18:18.793
Hey!

01:18:23.866 --> 01:18:27.368
So I'm supposed to like you
because you give me pies?

01:18:27.370 --> 01:18:30.104
No, you're just supposed
to eat the pie.

01:18:43.152 --> 01:18:45.886
[children chattering]

01:18:46.789 --> 01:18:47.888
[Ratboy] Oops.

01:18:58.034 --> 01:19:01.202
[Mildred] We will begin now
by practicing our handwriting.

01:19:01.204 --> 01:19:03.971
Get out your paper and pencils.

01:19:03.973 --> 01:19:07.141
Your handwriting, children,
is of utmost importance.

01:19:07.143 --> 01:19:10.511
That is why we practice it
every single day.

01:19:10.513 --> 01:19:12.480
People will judge you

01:19:12.482 --> 01:19:15.883
by your handwriting
before they even meet you.

01:19:15.885 --> 01:19:20.287
So it is absolutely essential
that all of your "T's"
be crossed correctly,

01:19:20.289 --> 01:19:21.922
all your "I's" dotted,

01:19:21.924 --> 01:19:24.258
all your letters
formed with precision

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:28.028
in articulate,
absolutely correct form.

01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:31.398
Otherwise, people may gain
an incorrect impression of you

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:35.169
before they even have
the opportunity to meet you.

01:19:35.171 --> 01:19:38.773
Here in this class, we form
the foundations of character,

01:19:38.775 --> 01:19:41.408
of your future life.

01:19:41.410 --> 01:19:45.045
[Waterman] I appreciate
your help with that shed.

01:19:45.047 --> 01:19:47.381
One more gust
and I think it'd be gone.

01:19:48.785 --> 01:19:49.884
Nothin' to it, Ben.

01:19:51.354 --> 01:19:55.055
[both panting]

01:19:55.057 --> 01:19:56.257
You need to know, Willard,

01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:59.059
we're good folks around here.

01:19:59.962 --> 01:20:01.929
[panting] I know that.

01:20:02.899 --> 01:20:03.998
I see it every day.

01:20:05.868 --> 01:20:07.535
But all the bother
we've given you,

01:20:10.106 --> 01:20:12.173
it's just the way
we've been brought up.

01:20:12.175 --> 01:20:14.175
It's us trying to do
what we think is right.

01:20:15.845 --> 01:20:17.978
I understand. It's...

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:19.947
We're all trying to learn,
right?

01:20:19.949 --> 01:20:21.248
At least we ought to be.

01:20:23.419 --> 01:20:25.920
I hope you don't mind
me asking, Willard,

01:20:26.856 --> 01:20:28.122
but we all wonder,

01:20:29.926 --> 01:20:31.525
are you a polygamist?

01:20:31.527 --> 01:20:32.593
[chuckles]

01:20:34.497 --> 01:20:35.930
No, sir, I'm not.

01:20:38.434 --> 01:20:39.500
My Daddy was.

01:20:41.437 --> 01:20:46.240
He had three wives and...
I'm one of 30 of his children.

01:20:46.242 --> 01:20:50.411
Thirty kids? [laughing]
Imagine that.

01:20:50.413 --> 01:20:53.047
Pretty tough getting a turn
at the outhouse, huh?

01:20:53.049 --> 01:20:55.983
[laughing] I suppose so.

01:20:58.187 --> 01:20:59.253
Yeah, polygamy ended years ago.

01:21:04.026 --> 01:21:05.292
But I will tell you this,
my friend.

01:21:06.996 --> 01:21:08.362
Rebecca's my second wife.

01:21:09.565 --> 01:21:10.898
You don't say.

01:21:12.001 --> 01:21:13.500
My first wife was Gussie.

01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:17.471
She was a lovely lady.

01:21:19.141 --> 01:21:21.408
I just, uh...

01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:22.977
I didn't give her her just due.

01:21:25.948 --> 01:21:27.948
I was always working,

01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:30.217
or... boxing,

01:21:30.219 --> 01:21:33.387
or... gone.

01:21:36.425 --> 01:21:38.459
And some man
started flattering her,

01:21:38.461 --> 01:21:41.095
and... showing her attention,

01:21:41.097 --> 01:21:43.497
and just... being there for
her.

01:21:45.001 --> 01:21:46.066
So she left me.

01:21:48.004 --> 01:21:49.069
I divorced her.

01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:51.305
And, uh,

01:21:52.909 --> 01:21:54.975
she and the mister
got married soon thereafter.

01:21:58.648 --> 01:22:00.347
Not long after that,
he started beating her.

01:22:05.254 --> 01:22:07.421
Six months into their marriage,
he took her life.

01:22:15.298 --> 01:22:16.530
I should have done better.

01:22:21.070 --> 01:22:24.171
[sighs] But Rebecca...

01:22:24.173 --> 01:22:26.340
[chuckles] she is wonderful.

01:22:27.576 --> 01:22:29.944
She is my sweetheart.

01:22:32.982 --> 01:22:36.583
I'm just... trying to do
better.

01:22:42.224 --> 01:22:43.724
Last year,

01:22:43.726 --> 01:22:46.360
President Harding won
the election over James Cox

01:22:46.362 --> 01:22:48.128
by a landslide.

01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:50.064
And now some people are saying

01:22:50.066 --> 01:22:51.966
their vote didn't matter

01:22:51.968 --> 01:22:54.168
and that it never matters.

01:22:54.170 --> 01:22:55.402
Let's talk about that.

01:22:57.039 --> 01:22:59.640
Does one vote...
make a difference?

01:23:03.212 --> 01:23:04.645
Who has an idea?

01:23:06.515 --> 01:23:09.316
-I do.
-Go ahead.

01:23:09.318 --> 01:23:11.986
I think every person's
vote matters.

01:23:11.988 --> 01:23:13.053
And...

01:23:20.496 --> 01:23:21.996
why is that?

01:23:24.433 --> 01:23:27.634
Because even if
everybody else thinks different

01:23:28.704 --> 01:23:30.471
and you're just one person,

01:23:31.574 --> 01:23:33.774
you're still a person.

01:23:33.776 --> 01:23:37.077
And other people should listen
to what you say too,

01:23:38.714 --> 01:23:41.315
because you still have
feelings.

01:24:20.089 --> 01:24:21.255
[knocking at door]

01:24:33.836 --> 01:24:35.536
Can you play?

01:24:37.339 --> 01:24:40.074
Momma, can I play?

01:24:40.076 --> 01:24:42.176
[Rebecca] With who?

01:24:42.178 --> 01:24:43.777
My best friend!

01:24:45.147 --> 01:24:47.581
[both giggling]

01:25:01.130 --> 01:25:04.531
Our first baptisms
in 90 something years.

01:25:04.533 --> 01:25:08.502
-Thank you, Brother Bean.
-Oh no, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

01:25:11.707 --> 01:25:14.875
-Oh, hey, have I told you
two about Church callings?
-I'm so happy for you.

01:25:14.877 --> 01:25:17.544
No? I must have forgot.

01:25:22.418 --> 01:25:24.351
I'll be in the barn.

01:25:24.353 --> 01:25:26.420
[telephone ringing]

01:25:28.591 --> 01:25:30.757
[telephone ringing]

01:25:31.727 --> 01:25:33.393
Oh, no.

01:25:34.463 --> 01:25:36.530
Now what am I supposed to say?

01:25:36.532 --> 01:25:38.699
[whispers] Hello.

01:25:38.701 --> 01:25:41.502
-[loudly] Hello!
-Not so loud.

01:25:41.504 --> 01:25:44.371
-Just regular.
-[Konger] Mr. Bean.

01:25:44.373 --> 01:25:48.575
This is Mr. Konger.
I am the lawyer handling
the estate of Pliny Sexton.

01:25:49.311 --> 01:25:50.811
Hello.

01:25:50.813 --> 01:25:53.480
-Yes, Mr. Konger.
-Not every time. Just...

01:25:53.482 --> 01:25:57.451
[Mr. Konger]
I'd like to meet with you
about the Mormon Hill property.

01:25:57.453 --> 01:26:00.787
Would it be possible
for you to come down
to Mr. Sexton's old office?

01:26:00.789 --> 01:26:04.258
Certainly, let me just finish
what I was doing.

01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:08.395
[Mr. Konger chuckles] I, uh,
think you'll want to
come now Mr. Bean,

01:26:08.397 --> 01:26:09.930
while you still have the
chance.

01:26:11.233 --> 01:26:13.367
All right, I'm on my way.

01:26:16.605 --> 01:26:17.671
Good?

01:26:18.908 --> 01:26:20.440
[whispers] Oh, boy.

01:26:26.448 --> 01:26:30.350
The last heir who was
antagonistic toward the Mormons
has passed away

01:26:30.352 --> 01:26:34.388
and the remaining heirs are
currently in the position of

01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:36.290
just wanting to get rid of it.

01:26:36.292 --> 01:26:40.294
Now, I know you've made
an agreement with Mr. Welch

01:26:40.296 --> 01:26:43.430
on the other portion
of the hill, which frankly,

01:26:43.432 --> 01:26:46.266
I don't know how
you pulled that one off.

01:26:46.268 --> 01:26:48.702
Well, I can assure you,
it had more to do with
love and kindness

01:26:48.704 --> 01:26:49.870
than it did with money.

01:26:52.274 --> 01:26:55.709
[scoffs] I still don't get
that,
but in any case,

01:26:55.711 --> 01:26:57.477
are you still interested?

01:26:58.447 --> 01:26:59.513
At what price, sir?

01:27:01.383 --> 01:27:02.950
The price you've always held
to.

01:27:06.255 --> 01:27:10.457
In that case, Mr. Konger,
we are very interested.

01:27:10.459 --> 01:27:13.460
Very good.
I'll get the paper work
to you as soon as...

01:27:22.705 --> 01:27:25.372
Daddy, I think
I heard the mailman.

01:27:32.781 --> 01:27:34.348
The mailman came, Daddy.

01:27:39.788 --> 01:27:41.722
Do you need anything?

01:27:41.724 --> 01:27:42.923
No, thank you, Palmyra.

01:28:34.343 --> 01:28:36.376
-What's wrong, sweetheart?
-[sniffles]

01:28:42.418 --> 01:28:45.018
"Dear Brother and Sister Bean,

01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:48.488
For 25 years,
you and Sister Bean
have labored faithfully

01:28:48.490 --> 01:28:50.524
as missionaries
in Palmyra, New York.

01:28:52.628 --> 01:28:55.929
With appreciation for
your loyalty and faithfulness,

01:28:58.067 --> 01:28:59.633
we now extend to you

01:28:59.635 --> 01:29:02.336
an honorable release
from your assignment.

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:06.907
With love
and immeasurable gratitude,

01:29:07.876 --> 01:29:10.377
President Heber J. Grant."

01:29:10.946 --> 01:29:13.547
[sniffling]

01:29:13.549 --> 01:29:14.948
[Rebecca sighs]

01:29:17.986 --> 01:29:19.586
[Willard sighs]

01:29:35.037 --> 01:29:36.636
[Willard] Where'd it all go?

01:29:38.574 --> 01:29:40.407
[sniffling]

01:29:43.645 --> 01:29:46.146
It was a week ago
that we arrived here.

01:29:48.984 --> 01:29:50.617
Now they want us to go home?

01:29:52.454 --> 01:29:54.721
[inhales deeply]

01:29:54.723 --> 01:29:57.090
We've come to love these people
like family.

01:30:00.028 --> 01:30:01.428
Rebecca,

01:30:03.399 --> 01:30:04.698
what's happened to our life?

01:30:06.468 --> 01:30:08.468
[Rebecca sobbing]

01:30:11.673 --> 01:30:13.106
The time passed away,

01:30:14.643 --> 01:30:17.043
and also our lives passed away,

01:30:19.748 --> 01:30:21.948
like as it were unto us a
dream.

01:30:27.623 --> 01:30:30.490
[Thomas Winegar]
When they settled
on the Smith Farm,

01:30:30.492 --> 01:30:34.428
some of our citizens,
me included,

01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:40.100
started a tirade with the
object
of getting rid of them.

01:30:40.102 --> 01:30:43.537
But when they proved
to be good citizens,
we learned to tolerate them,

01:30:44.807 --> 01:30:47.107
then admire them
and respect them,

01:30:48.644 --> 01:30:49.776
and now we love them.

01:30:51.914 --> 01:30:56.049
Willard was at first
denied membership
into our organization,

01:30:56.051 --> 01:30:57.951
then later on becoming
our President.

01:30:59.855 --> 01:31:03.156
It is with reluctance
that we now bid farewell

01:31:03.158 --> 01:31:04.958
to the kindest family

01:31:06.161 --> 01:31:09.162
that ever lived in Wayne
County.

01:31:12.668 --> 01:31:14.034
Willard has a way about him

01:31:15.504 --> 01:31:17.971
that seems to turn enemies
into friends.

01:31:19.875 --> 01:31:21.975
His fearless demeanor,

01:31:23.812 --> 01:31:26.079
it just seems to rub off,

01:31:26.081 --> 01:31:30.050
and we all wish
that we had what he has.

01:31:30.052 --> 01:31:34.688
Willard and Rebecca also found
time to raise their family.

01:31:34.690 --> 01:31:38.692
Both Palmyra and Alvin
graduating from our High School

01:31:39.661 --> 01:31:41.161
as Valedictorians.

01:31:58.213 --> 01:32:00.213
The Mormon Church may think
it knows what it's doing

01:32:00.215 --> 01:32:02.182
by sending them back,
but we don't think so.

01:32:02.184 --> 01:32:04.150
[all laughing]

01:32:07.022 --> 01:32:08.955
They couldn't have found
another man

01:32:08.957 --> 01:32:11.024
who could have done the things
that you have done here.

01:32:14.630 --> 01:32:17.030
And if we went
to the civic club today
to take a vote as to

01:32:17.032 --> 01:32:20.934
whom is the most popular man
in Palmyra,

01:32:20.936 --> 01:32:24.237
it most certainly would be
Willard Bean.

01:32:30.812 --> 01:32:32.279
Goodbye.

01:32:32.281 --> 01:32:34.648
[Thomas Winegar]
They have won a warm spot

01:32:35.317 --> 01:32:37.150
in our hearts

01:32:37.152 --> 01:32:38.852
and will ever forever live

01:32:38.854 --> 01:32:41.054
in the memory
of this generation.

01:32:50.632 --> 01:32:51.898
Love you.

01:32:57.205 --> 01:32:59.739
Thanks. Goodbye.

01:33:01.043 --> 01:33:02.309
[Thomas Winegar]
Willard and Rebecca,

01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:06.112
we absolutely hate
to see you go.

01:33:08.350 --> 01:33:09.749
[James Welch] Don't leave!

01:33:12.087 --> 01:33:13.153
Never!

01:33:15.891 --> 01:33:18.024
[Thomas Winegar]
May God bless you

01:33:18.026 --> 01:33:21.127
and go with you...
in all that you do.

01:33:33.375 --> 01:33:36.610
Eight, nine,

01:33:37.079 --> 01:33:39.045
ten. Out!

01:33:40.682 --> 01:33:42.916
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:33:42.918 --> 01:33:47.988
the 1905 middle-weight
champion of the world,

01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:51.157
-Willard Bean!
