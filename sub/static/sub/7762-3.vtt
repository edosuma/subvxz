* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

00:53.654 --> 00:55.723
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

01:33.894 --> 01:36.130

01:41.235 --> 01:42.903

02:25.746 --> 02:27.415
- BUY YOU A DRINK?

02:27.448 --> 02:29.583
- GREY GOOSE AND ARSENIC.

02:29.617 --> 02:31.519
- HEY, THAT SHOULD BE TOMORROW
NIGHT'S TWO-BUCK SPECIAL.

02:31.552 --> 02:34.322
WE'LL MAKE, OH...

02:34.355 --> 02:36.657
AT LEAST, UH,
SIX BUCKS.

02:36.690 --> 02:39.660
- I BOUGHT
A FULL-PAGE SPREAD IN OUT.

02:39.693 --> 02:43.197
I PUT WINDOW-CARDS
IN EVERY SHOP ON LIBERTY AVENUE.

02:43.231 --> 02:45.266
I EVEN HAD FUCKING
GO-GO BOYS IN SPEEDOS

02:45.299 --> 02:46.534
PASSING OUT FLYERS.

02:46.567 --> 02:47.935
- WITH PROMOTION LIKE THAT,

02:47.968 --> 02:49.537
THERE SHOULD BE LINES
AROUND THE BLOCK.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.739
- OH, THERE ARE.
AT POPPERZ.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.674
[whip cracks]

02:53.707 --> 02:55.676
- DRINKS ON THE HOUSE

02:55.709 --> 02:57.845
FOR WASTING OUR TIME
AND OUR TALENT.

03:00.314 --> 03:02.883
- I DON'T GET
WHY EVERYONE LEFT.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.718
- THAT'S ONE OF
THE GREAT MYSTERIES OF LIFE.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.687
HOW DOES A BUD
KNOW WHEN TO OPEN?

03:06.720 --> 03:08.556
HOW DOES A BIRD
KNOW HOW TO FLY?

03:08.589 --> 03:14.262
- WHY DO QUEERS
DESERT ONE CLUB FOR ANOTHER?

03:16.797 --> 03:18.299
- [sighs]

03:18.332 --> 03:19.967
OH, I KNOW.
I'M LATE.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.602
I'M SORRY.
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.437
- OH, HOW'S MY SWEETIE?

03:23.471 --> 03:25.506
- OUT LIKE A LIGHT.
- YEAH.

03:25.539 --> 03:28.709
HOW MUCH XANAX
DID YOU GIVE HER?

03:28.742 --> 03:30.344
IT WAS A JOKE.

03:30.378 --> 03:31.479
- I WISH I COULD
GET HER TO SLEEP

03:31.512 --> 03:32.880
INSTEAD
OF CRYING ALL NIGHT.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.582
- WHAT DID JACOBS
HAVE TO SAY?

03:34.615 --> 03:36.450
- OH, MICHAEL
DOESN'T HAVE A FUCKING CHANCE

03:36.484 --> 03:39.320
OF PROVING HE'D BE A BETTER
CUSTODIAL PARENT THAN ME.

03:39.353 --> 03:41.489
AND THE JUDGE ALMOST ALWAYS
FAVORS THE MOTHER.

03:41.522 --> 03:43.924
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED WITH HUNTER'S
MOTHER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.526
- WELL, IN THIS CASE,
THAT'S A RELIEF.

03:45.559 --> 03:48.896
- YEAH. OH, BUT THERE
IS ONE MORE THING.

03:48.929 --> 03:51.532
HE THINKS IT'S BEST
IF I GO TO THE MEETING ALONE.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.000
- AND WHY IS THAT?

03:53.033 --> 03:55.336
- IT'D BE MORE PRUDENT,
AND LESS COMPLICATED,

03:55.369 --> 03:56.537
IF WE KEPT THINGS BETWEEN

03:56.570 --> 03:57.938
THE BIRTH MOTHER
AND THE BIRTH FATHER.

03:57.971 --> 03:59.907
- WELL, I DON'T THINK
IT'S SO PRUDENT.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.542
I HAVE AS MUCH RIGHT
TO BE THERE AS YOU DO.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.043
- ACTUALLY, YOU DON'T,
AND YOUR PRESENCE

04:03.076 --> 04:06.480
COULD PROVE DETRIMENTAL
TO MY CASE.

04:06.514 --> 04:09.483
- "YOUR CASE"?

04:09.517 --> 04:12.753
WE WERE LIFE PARTNERS
FOR TEN YEARS.

04:12.786 --> 04:14.422
- AND NOW,
WE'RE DIVORCING LESBIANS.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.056
NOT EVEN DIVORCING.
DISSOLVING.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.292
LOOK, WHY MAKE MATTERS
MORE COMPLICATED?

04:18.326 --> 04:19.360
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT ME?

04:19.393 --> 04:20.561
- YOU AND I
WILL STILL HAVE

04:20.594 --> 04:23.063
THE SAME ARRANGEMENT
WE HAVE NOW.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.898
WE'LL SPEND EQUAL TIME
WITH JENNY REBECCA.

04:24.932 --> 04:28.035
SAME WITH GUS.
THAT WON'T CHANGE.

04:28.068 --> 04:31.939
YOU'LL JUST HAVE
TO TRUST ME.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.910
- SHE SAID SHE AND HER LAWYER
TALKED IT OVER

04:36.944 --> 04:39.647
AND DECIDED IT'D BE BEST
FOR ME NOT TO BE THERE

04:39.680 --> 04:41.315
WHEN THEY MEET WITH MICHAEL
AND HIS LAWYER.

04:41.349 --> 04:43.317
SHE SAYS THE FACT
THAT WE'RE NOT TOGETHER

04:43.351 --> 04:44.785
WILL ONLY COMPLICATE
THE CASE

04:44.818 --> 04:46.320
AND GIVE MICHAEL
MORE AMMUNITION.

04:46.354 --> 04:47.655
BUT I THINK
I HAVE AS MUCH RIGHT

04:47.688 --> 04:48.956
TO BE THERE AS THEY DO,

04:48.989 --> 04:51.992
EVEN IF I'M NOT
THE BIOLOGICAL PARENT.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.830
- BLUE ROOSTER?

04:56.864 --> 05:00.368
THE CHICKEN CHAIN?

05:00.401 --> 05:01.702
THEY NEED A CAMPAIGN

05:01.735 --> 05:04.805
FOR THEIR
NEW 16-OUNCE SANDWICH.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.073
HOW DO YOU LIKE,

05:06.106 --> 05:10.478
"WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY
FOR A BIG COCK"?

05:11.779 --> 05:15.583
YEAH, THEY DIDN'T
LIKE IT EITHER.

05:15.616 --> 05:18.819
SO WHAT DID MELANIE SAY?

05:18.852 --> 05:20.754
- SHE SAID
I SHOULD TRUST HER.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.423
- [scoffs]

05:22.456 --> 05:23.557
- AND ONCE EVERYTHING
WAS SETTLED,

05:23.591 --> 05:26.460
SHE'D SHARE CUSTODY
WITH ME.

05:26.494 --> 05:29.363
THAT WE HAVE A DEAL.

05:29.397 --> 05:32.866
- THE WAY SHE HAD
A DEAL WITH MICHAEL?

05:32.900 --> 05:37.571
- I WANT TO BELIEVE HER.
I DO.

05:37.605 --> 05:41.709
WE TRIED TO BE FAIR
WHERE THE KIDS ARE CONCERNED.

05:41.742 --> 05:44.111
BUT I'M THE ONE
WITH THE MOST TO LOSE.

05:44.144 --> 05:47.781
- THEN STOP BITCHING
AND MOANING AND DO SOMETHING.

05:47.815 --> 05:51.919
- I CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON YOU
FOR THE COLD, HARD TRUTH.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.826
- HERE.

06:00.894 --> 06:01.929
- WHO'S HE?

06:01.962 --> 06:03.931
- IT'S A LAWYER
FRIEND OF MINE.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.899
I'LL GIVE HIM A CALL FIRST.

06:05.933 --> 06:10.804
AND STOP WORRYING ABOUT HOW MUCH
IT'S GOING TO COST.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.906
- I GUESS I HAVE NO CHOICE.

06:12.940 --> 06:15.609
- I GUESS NOT.

06:15.643 --> 06:17.778
OH, THE QUEERS
ARE ABOUT TO FIND OUT

06:17.811 --> 06:21.148
WHAT THE BREEDERS
HAVE KNOWN ALL ALONG:

06:21.181 --> 06:25.152
IN A MESSY DIVORCE...

06:25.185 --> 06:28.456
NOBODY STAYS CLEAN.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.159
- WHEN I WAS IN L.A.,

06:32.192 --> 06:34.094
THINKING I MIGHT COME BACK
TO PITTSBURGH AND PAINT,

06:34.127 --> 06:36.063
I DIDN'T IMAGINE
IT WOULD BE LIKE THIS.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.931
- TELL YOU WHAT,
YOU CAN SIGN THE WALL.

06:37.965 --> 06:40.100
- WE REALLY APPRECIATE
THE EXTRA HAND.

06:40.133 --> 06:41.569
HEY, SOMEDAY, WHEN YOU
AND BRIAN GET A HOUSE,

06:41.602 --> 06:42.836
WE'LL RETURN THE FAVOR.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.538
- DON'T RUN
TO THE PAINT STORE.

06:44.572 --> 06:45.773
- OH, YOU NEVER KNOW.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.207
HEY, GUESS WHAT I NEVER DID?

06:47.240 --> 06:49.109
- PUT RAT TRAPS
IN THE ATTIC?

06:49.142 --> 06:50.911
- CARRIED YOU
OVER THE THRESHOLD.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.513
THAT'S WHAT MARRIED PEOPLE DO,
RIGHT, JUSTIN?

06:52.546 --> 06:54.047
- I WOULDN'T KNOW.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.783
- WELL, WHY DON'T I CARRY YOU
OVER THE THRESHOLD?

06:55.816 --> 06:56.984
- OH, YOU WANT TO TRY,
BIG GUY?

06:57.017 --> 06:59.119
- [grunts]
OH, MY GOD.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.921
- [grunts]
- OH, OH, JESUS, BEN!

07:00.954 --> 07:02.690
- COME ON, BABY,
LET'S MAKE THIS OFFICIAL.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.792
- PUT ME DOWN.
- HERE WE GO.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.727
- HEY, YOU GUYS PLAYING
A LITTLE ROUGHHOUSE

07:06.760 --> 07:09.997
IN YOUR NEW HOUSE?

07:10.030 --> 07:11.532
- HEY, SUNSHINE.

07:11.565 --> 07:12.666
- HEY.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.234
- I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU BOYS--

07:14.267 --> 07:16.236
DAMN IT, YOU MEN--
COULD USE SOME LUNCH,

07:16.269 --> 07:18.005
SO I BROUGHT
SOME CHEESE STEAKS

07:18.038 --> 07:19.673
AND ONE VEGGIE HOAGIE
FOR MY SON-IN-LAW.

07:19.707 --> 07:21.842
- OH, THANKS, DEB.

07:21.875 --> 07:24.878
- WOW, THIS PLACE
IS REALLY SHAPING UP, HUH?

07:24.912 --> 07:26.246
- YEAH.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.581
- YOU KNOW WHAT
WOULD LOOK GREAT ON THIS WALL?

07:27.615 --> 07:28.682
- WHAT,
ANOTHER COAT OF PAINT?

07:28.716 --> 07:30.217
- MY VELVET CAT PAINTING.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.553
HUH?
FROM MY LIVING ROOM.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.722
I'VE BEEN SAVING IT
FOR YOU, HONEY.

07:34.755 --> 07:38.692
- I'LL TAKE THESE
TO THE KITCHEN.

07:38.726 --> 07:39.960
- WHAT'S UP HIS ASS?

07:39.993 --> 07:41.161
- WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT?

07:41.194 --> 07:43.030
- I'LL LEAVE THAT TO YOU.

07:43.063 --> 07:45.566
I'D SURE LIKE TO KNOW
WHY HE'S SO FUCKING PISSY!

07:45.599 --> 07:48.569
- [laughs]

07:48.602 --> 07:50.237
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE FINISH THE WALLS IN HERE

07:50.270 --> 07:51.705
AND THEN CHOW DOWN?

07:51.739 --> 07:53.106
- YEAH, I'M STARVING.

07:53.140 --> 07:56.744
MY ARM'S ABOUT TO FALL OFF.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.245
- TAKE A LOAD OFF.

07:58.278 --> 08:01.882
- YOU MIGHT TRY THANKING ME
FOR THE SANDWICHES.

08:01.915 --> 08:04.885
- THANKS.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

08:04.918 --> 08:07.287
AND WHY HAVEN'T I
HEARD FROM YOU IN A WEEK?

08:07.320 --> 08:08.922
- I'VE BEEN KIND OF BUSY.

08:08.956 --> 08:11.158
- DON'T OPEN UP A MOUTH.

08:11.191 --> 08:15.796
I'M JUST ASKING.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.264
YOU NEED TO STOCK UP.

08:17.297 --> 08:18.866
WHY DON'T I GO
TO THE GROCERY AND--

08:18.899 --> 08:20.000
- BETTER YET,
WHY DON'T YOU GO STOCK UP

08:20.033 --> 08:22.970
MELANIE'S REFRIGERATOR?

08:25.906 --> 08:27.675
- WHY THE HELL
WOULD I DO THAT?

08:27.708 --> 08:29.209
- YOU TOLD HER
YOU AGREED WITH HER.

08:29.242 --> 08:31.945
YOU'RE ON HER SIDE.
MY OWN MOTHER.

08:31.979 --> 08:35.015
- WHAT I SAID WAS, I WAS NOT
ON ANYONE'S SIDE,

08:35.048 --> 08:37.685
TO THINK OF ME
LIKE SWITZERLAND.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.620
- WHAT,
A HAVEN FOR NAZI GOLD?

08:39.653 --> 08:41.622
- NEUTRAL.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.223
ALL I CARE ABOUT
IS THAT KID.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.892
- SO DO I.

08:44.925 --> 08:45.959
THAT'S WHY I WANT
HER IN A LOVING HOME

08:45.993 --> 08:47.194
WITH TWO PARENTS.

08:47.227 --> 08:50.898
WHY IS THAT SO HARD
TO COMPREHEND?

08:50.931 --> 08:52.332
- WHAT'S HARD TO COMPREHEND

08:52.365 --> 08:54.167
IS HOW ANGRY
YOU HAVE BEEN AT ME

08:54.201 --> 08:57.170
ALL THESE YEARS
FOR BEING A SINGLE MOM.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.840
AND HERE I ALWAYS THOUGHT
WE MADE IT THROUGH JUST FINE,

08:59.873 --> 09:03.310
YOU AND ME,
THE TWO MUSKETEERS.

09:03.343 --> 09:05.679
BUT APPARENTLY NOT.

09:05.713 --> 09:07.681
WELL, I'M SORRY
I COULDN'T GIVE YOU

09:07.715 --> 09:10.350
EVERYTHING YOU WANTED.

09:10.383 --> 09:13.954
BUT I GAVE YOU
EVERYTHING I COULD.

09:20.961 --> 09:23.330
- YOU ARE THE LUCKIEST FUCK
IN PITTSBURGH.

09:23.363 --> 09:25.866
- AS IF THAT WERE REASON
TO BARGE INTO MY OFFICE.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.000
- I FOUND YOU A BUYER.

09:27.034 --> 09:29.937
- HOORAY.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.104
WHAT AM I SELLING?

09:31.138 --> 09:33.006
- BABYLON.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.375
YEAH. A CONSORTIUM
WANTS TO BUILD A GALLERIA,

09:35.408 --> 09:36.944
AND THEY'RE WILLING
TO BUY OUT YOUR LEASE

09:36.977 --> 09:40.948
AT A VERY GOOD PRICE.

09:40.981 --> 09:44.151
WELL, AREN'T YOU EXCITED?
RELIEVED? OVERJOYED?

09:44.184 --> 09:45.619
I MEAN, IN ANOTHER COUPLE
OF WEEKS, YOU WOULD'VE

09:45.653 --> 09:46.887
HAD TO TAKE OUT LOANS
AGAINST KINNETIK

09:46.920 --> 09:48.388
TO PAY FOR THAT
FERKAKTA CLUB.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.990
- YEAH,
UNLESS I TURN IT AROUND.

09:50.023 --> 09:52.292
- NOT EVEN RAGE
COULD ACCOMPLISH THAT FEAT.

09:52.325 --> 09:55.095
OH, AND THE BEAUTY PART IS,
WE'LL WRITE IT OFF.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.697
YOU CAN USE IT
FOR A TAX DEDUCTION.

09:56.730 --> 10:00.133
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE GOOD,
PRACTICAL ADVICE.

10:00.167 --> 10:04.137
JUST WALK AWAY,
LEAVE IT TO THE DEVELOPERS.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.974
HUH.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.842
AND AFTER THEY FINISH
TURNING BABYLON

10:08.876 --> 10:12.846
INTO THE MALL OF AMERICA,
THEN WHAT?

10:12.880 --> 10:14.381
MAKE WOODY'S
INTO A WALMART?

10:14.414 --> 10:16.750
TORSO INTO TARGET?
- [sighs]

10:16.784 --> 10:19.386
- THE DINER
INTO AN OLIVE GARDEN?

10:19.419 --> 10:21.254
I'M SORRY, THEODORE,

10:21.288 --> 10:23.056
I'M SURE THERE
ARE MILLIONS OF FAGGOTS

10:23.090 --> 10:24.391
WHO'D LIKE NOTHING MORE
THAN TO WALK

10:24.424 --> 10:26.259
THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.395
BUT I'D SOONER DIE
THAN SEE LIBERTY AVENUE

10:28.428 --> 10:33.233
HOMOGENIZED
AND DE-HOMO-IZED.

10:35.168 --> 10:36.403
- HI, HON.

10:36.436 --> 10:38.205
- HI, SWEETHEART.
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

10:38.238 --> 10:39.740
- WELL, IF YOU CARE
TO TAKE OFF YOUR COAT

10:39.773 --> 10:40.908
AND STICK AROUND
FOR A WHILE,

10:40.941 --> 10:42.275
I'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.410
- I'D LIKE TO TAKE OFF
MORE THAN THAT,

10:43.443 --> 10:45.045
BUT I'M LATE FOR MY SHIFT.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.780
THERE'S SAUSAGE AND RIGATONI
ON THE STOVE.

10:46.814 --> 10:49.783
BE CAREFUL 'CAUSE THE SAUSAGES
ARE REAL GARLICKY.

10:49.817 --> 10:53.687
- WE'LL JUST HAVE TO PUT
SOME BREATH MINTS BY THE BED.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.356
WHEN WILL YOU BE BACK?

10:56.389 --> 10:58.692
- AROUND 1:00.
- PERFECT.

10:58.726 --> 11:02.329
I'LL BE ASLEEP AROUND 12:59.

11:02.362 --> 11:04.965
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE DECIDED
TO LIVE TOGETHER,

11:04.998 --> 11:07.768
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
AT THE SAME TIME.

11:07.801 --> 11:10.871
- YOU KNOW
IT ISN'T ALWAYS LIKE THIS.

11:13.807 --> 11:17.711
- I DON'T WANT TO COME HOME
TO SAUSAGE AND RIGATONI.

11:17.745 --> 11:21.181
I WANT TO COME HOME
TO SAUSAGE AND RIGATONI AND YOU.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.050
- AS SOON AS BETTY'S
BACK FROM HER SURGERY,

11:23.083 --> 11:24.317
I WON'T HAVE TO DO
ANY MORE LATE SHIFTS.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.486
- WHY DO YOU
HAVE TO DO ANY SHIFTS?

11:26.519 --> 11:28.121
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

11:28.155 --> 11:29.823
- YOU KILL YOURSELF
DOWN AT THE DINER,

11:29.857 --> 11:31.258
ON YOUR FEET
DAY AND NIGHT. WHY?

11:31.291 --> 11:32.926
- IT'S WHAT I DO.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.461
IT'S WHAT I'VE ALWAYS DONE.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.396
- THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU HAVE TO KEEP ON DOING IT.

11:36.429 --> 11:38.265
- WHAT DO I DO FOR MONEY,
PRINT IT?

11:38.298 --> 11:39.366
YOU'D ARREST ME.

11:39.399 --> 11:42.069
- I HAVE MONEY.

11:42.102 --> 11:44.738
- CARL, I'VE NEVER
LIVED OFF ANYONE.

11:44.772 --> 11:46.473
I'VE NEVER ASKED
FOR SO MUCH AS A DIME.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.275
I DON'T INTEND TO START NOW.

11:48.308 --> 11:49.943
- YOU'RE NOT ASKING.

11:49.977 --> 11:52.345
I'M OFFERING.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.848
SWEETHEART, YOU'VE BEEN
LOOKING AFTER OTHERS

11:54.882 --> 11:56.483
PRACTICALLY
YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

11:56.516 --> 11:59.853
DON'T YOU DESERVE
A LITTLE TIME FOR YOURSELF?

11:59.887 --> 12:01.989
FOR US?

12:03.891 --> 12:05.492
- OKAY, EVERYONE, I'D LIKE YOU
TO MEET EMMETT HONEYCUTT,

12:05.525 --> 12:06.760
OUR NEW QUEER GUY.

12:06.794 --> 12:08.228
- [laughs]

12:08.261 --> 12:10.363
I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE
AND MEET YOU ALL.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.099
HOPE I DON'T WET MYSELF.

12:12.132 --> 12:13.533
- JAKE ANDERS,
OUR NEWS ANCHOR.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.535
- OH MY GOD,
YOU'RE EVEN HOTTER IN PERSON,

12:15.568 --> 12:17.270
IF THAT'S POSSIBLE.

12:17.304 --> 12:19.006
EVERY GAY BOY'S DREAM.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.540
- MIRA YAMASUSHI,
OUR CO-ANCHOR.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.542
- I LOVE YOUR HAIR.

12:22.575 --> 12:25.145
I-IT'S SO MUCH MORE FLATTERING
THAN THE LUCY-RED CURLS

12:25.178 --> 12:26.880
YOU HAD DURING
THE MONICA LEWINSKY SCANDAL.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.782
- BUD LOCKWOOD, SPORTS.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.150
- OH, UM,
BETWEEN YOU AND ME, BUD,

12:30.183 --> 12:31.852
I USUALLY GO FOR A PEE
WHEN SPORTS ARE UP.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.520
BUT IT'S A PLEASURE.

12:33.553 --> 12:36.323
- AND OUR WEATHERMAN...
- JOHNNY MEMPHIS!

12:36.356 --> 12:38.125
[laughs]
I SWEAR BY YOU.

12:38.158 --> 12:39.392
WHEN YOU SAID
IT WAS GOING TO RAIN THE DAY

12:39.426 --> 12:40.928
OF GAY PRIDE,
ALL THOSE SILLY QUEENS

12:40.961 --> 12:42.529
LAUGHED AT ME
FOR BRINGING AN UMBRELLA,

12:42.562 --> 12:43.897
BUT GUESS WHOSE
HAIR AND GOWN SURVIVED

12:43.931 --> 12:45.132
THAT 40-MILE-AN-HOUR
COLD FRONT

12:45.165 --> 12:47.067
BLOWING IN FROM THE NORTH?

12:47.100 --> 12:49.436
YEAH.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.538
WELL...
[laughs]

12:51.571 --> 12:56.409
IT'S, UH, GREAT TO, UM--
TO BE PART OF THE TEAM.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.311
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN
THE WAY THEY LOOKED AT ME,

12:58.345 --> 13:02.149
LIKE I WAS SOME ALIEN
FROM URANUS.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.550
NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE SAYS,
IT'S A RELIEF

13:03.583 --> 13:05.452
TO COME BACK
TO OUR HOME SWEET HOMO.

13:05.485 --> 13:06.920
- YEAH, I USED
TO FEEL THE SAME WAY

13:06.954 --> 13:08.555
AFTER A DAY
AT WERTSHAFTERS.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.157
- YEAH, BUT YOU
CAN PASS FOR STRAIGHT.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.558
MY FLAME'S
ALWAYS BURNED TOO BIG

13:11.591 --> 13:12.826
AND TOO BRIGHT FOR THAT.

13:12.860 --> 13:14.561
- THEN CAN YOU HEAT UP
MY SOUP?

13:14.594 --> 13:16.196
- YOU KNOW, WHENEVER I'VE TRIED
TO PLAY ON A TEAM,

13:16.229 --> 13:19.299
I ALWAYS ENDED UP
ON THE BENCH.

13:19.332 --> 13:23.170
I DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN
THIS TIME.

13:23.203 --> 13:26.173
- FUCK!
- WHAT'S WRONG, DEB?

13:26.206 --> 13:28.441
- OH,
IT'S THIS GODDAMN SIGN.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.177
I MEAN, MY "HELP"
IS ALL RIGHT,

13:30.210 --> 13:32.379
BUT I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ROOM
HERE FOR "WANTED,"

13:32.412 --> 13:35.082
AND I HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN AROUND
TO "INQUIRE WITHIN".

13:35.115 --> 13:38.919
- HERE, LET ME.

13:38.952 --> 13:42.189
- IT SURE HELPS TO HAVE
AN ARTIST IN THE FAMILY.

13:42.222 --> 13:46.193
- WHO'S LEAVING?
BETTY? KIKI?

13:46.226 --> 13:48.095
- ME.

13:48.128 --> 13:49.963
- YOU?

13:49.997 --> 13:51.932
- WHAT, IS THAT
SO HARD TO BELIEVE?

13:51.965 --> 13:55.002
- YOU CAN'T LEAVE THE DINER,
DEBBIE, YOU ARE THE DINER.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.636
BESIDES, WHAT WOULD
WE DO WITHOUT YOU?

13:56.669 --> 13:58.939
- STILL COMPLAIN THAT YOUR
HASH BROWNS AREN'T CRISP ENOUGH

13:58.972 --> 14:00.473
AND YOUR SOUP
ISN'T HOT ENOUGH.

14:00.507 --> 14:03.076
DON'T THINK
I DIDN'T HEAR THAT.

14:03.110 --> 14:05.012
KEEP PRINTING.

14:05.045 --> 14:08.015
- THERE'S NOT SOMETHING WRONG,
IS THERE?

14:08.048 --> 14:10.350
- HUH?

14:10.383 --> 14:13.653
OH. HELL, NO.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.555
IT'S JUST THAT I'VE SPENT
THE LAST 25 YEARS

14:15.588 --> 14:20.360
LISTENING TO THESE BOYS COMPLAIN
ABOUT NOT FINDING A MAN.

14:20.393 --> 14:23.897
WELL, I'VE FINALLY FOUND ONE.

14:23.931 --> 14:27.534
EXCEPT I'M NEVER HOME WITH HIM.
I MEAN, HOW DUMB IS THAT?

14:27.567 --> 14:29.302
- BUT WHAT'LL YOU DO?

14:29.336 --> 14:31.972
- HMM, THERE'S ALWAYS
SOME BRIGHT NEW CHALLENGE,

14:32.005 --> 14:35.008
SOME SHINING NEW ADVENTURE.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.110
- LIKE YOU. YOU WENT OFF
TO FUCKING HOLLYWOOD.

14:37.144 --> 14:41.148
- HUH. BUT I CAME BACK
TO FUCKING PITTSBURGH.

14:41.181 --> 14:42.515
WHAT IF YOU WANT
TO COME BACK BUT YOU CAN'T

14:42.549 --> 14:44.117
BECAUSE SOMEONE
TOOK YOUR PLACE?

14:44.151 --> 14:46.920
- UH-UH, HONEY.
WHEN I'M GONE, I'M GONE.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.421
I'M DONATING MY VEST
AND MY T-SHIRTS

14:48.455 --> 14:51.424
TO THE SMITHSONIAN, AND IT IS
SO LONG, LIBERTY DINER,

14:51.458 --> 14:56.263
AND HELLO, LIBERTY.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.198
WOW.

14:58.231 --> 15:01.468
THAT'S NOT A SIGN.
THAT'S A WORK OF ART.

15:08.175 --> 15:10.077
- [grunts]

15:16.049 --> 15:17.550
NOT BAD.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.486
- IT'S BRILLIANT.

15:19.519 --> 15:22.022
- [laughs]

15:22.055 --> 15:24.958
- AN ARTIST CAN NEVER HAVE
TOO HIGH AN OPINION OF HIMSELF.

15:24.992 --> 15:27.494
- THEY WERE GOING TO BE PART
OF MY FINAL SCHOOL PROJECT.

15:27.527 --> 15:28.561
- THEY STILL CAN.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.330
- NO, IT'S TOO LATE.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.232
- AFTER HOLLYWOOD,

15:32.265 --> 15:34.167
IT WOULD
FEEL LIKE A PREQUEL.

15:34.201 --> 15:37.971
- AND NOT A VERY GOOD ONE.

15:38.005 --> 15:40.107
I'M GOING TO TAKE MY TIME,
LOOK AROUND,

15:40.140 --> 15:43.176
FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO NEXT.

15:43.210 --> 15:44.511
- I'VE GOT IT.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.446
HOW ABOUT
A FULL-TIME CAREER

15:46.479 --> 15:51.451
AT ONE OF PITTSBURGH'S
TOP ADVERTISING AGENCIES?

15:51.484 --> 15:53.320
- THANKS.

15:53.353 --> 15:57.224
IT'S TIME I MAKE
MY OWN WAY IN THE WORLD.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.330
- JUST AS WELL, SINCE I HEAR
THE GUY WHO OWNS IT

16:03.363 --> 16:05.065
IS ABOUT TO LOSE HIS SHIRT.

16:05.098 --> 16:08.335
- I'M SURE HE'LL SURVIVE,
AS HE ALWAYS DOES...

16:08.368 --> 16:11.104
BEAUTIFULLY.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.508
ARE YOU GOING SOMEWHERE?

16:15.542 --> 16:19.246
- TO THE SOON-TO-BE-FORMER
BABYLON.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.381
CAN'T LET THE SHIP GO DOWN
WITHOUT THE CAPTAIN.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.483
- THIS CLUB BRETT
TOOK ME TO IN L.A.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.352
REALLY KNEW
HOW TO WORK IT.

16:25.385 --> 16:28.121
THERE'D BE FAGS LINED UP AROUND
THE BLOCK, BEGGING TO GET IN.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.490
- IT MUST HAVE BEEN
A HELL OF A PLACE.

16:30.523 --> 16:33.093
- IT WASN'T THAT DIFFERENT
THAN HERE.

16:33.126 --> 16:36.263
THEY JUST MADE IT SEEM
LIKE IT WAS.

16:42.302 --> 16:44.771
- SUNSHINE, HOW DID I EVER
GET ALONG WITHOUT YOU?

16:44.804 --> 16:47.407
- YOU DIDN'T.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.585
- I WAS AT THE MAISONETTE
FOR 12 YEARS.

16:58.618 --> 17:02.055
THEN I DID A 10-YEAR STINT
AT CHARLIE'S SMOKE--

17:02.089 --> 17:04.524
[hacking cough]

17:04.557 --> 17:07.527
SMOKEHOUSE.

17:07.560 --> 17:10.697
UH, FOR THE PAST 19 YEARS,
I'VE BEEN AT BUDDHA'S GARDEN,

17:10.730 --> 17:12.799
THE HEALTH FOOD RESTAURANT?

17:12.832 --> 17:15.268
- SO WHY'D YOU LEAVE?
- OWNER DIED.

17:15.302 --> 17:18.738
I THINK HE OD'D
ON TOFU BURGERS.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.840
[laughs and coughs]

17:20.873 --> 17:22.542
- WELL...

17:22.575 --> 17:25.178
YOU CERTAINLY DO QUALIFY.
SO, UM...

17:25.212 --> 17:26.746
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.
- THANKS.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.615
[coughs]

17:28.648 --> 17:30.550
OH, BY THE WAY,
IS THERE A PLACE AROUND HERE

17:30.583 --> 17:32.685
I CAN GET SOME CIGARETTES?

17:32.719 --> 17:34.454
- YEAH. LIBERTY LIQUOR,
RIGHT DOWN THE STREET.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.356
THANKS.
[coughs]

17:36.389 --> 17:38.091
- HEY, DEB,
IT'S ALMOST TIME.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.692
- I'M COMING!

17:39.726 --> 17:41.361
- READY FOR THE BIG PREMIERE?

17:41.394 --> 17:43.730
- IT SHOULD BE A GREAT WEEKEND
FOR SPORTS. JAKE?

17:43.763 --> 17:46.599
- THANKS, BUD.
I KNOW I'LL BE WATCHING.

17:46.633 --> 17:50.303
WELL, UP NEXT, A GUY
WHO'S NOT EXACTLY AN IRON MAN,

17:50.337 --> 17:53.373
BUT, UH, HOPEFULLY, HE CAN SCORE
A FEW POINTS WITH OUR VIEWERS.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.308
TONIGHT, WE INTRODUCE
THE NEWEST MEMBER

17:55.342 --> 17:56.843
OF THE CHANNEL 5
NEWS TEAM.

17:56.876 --> 17:59.879
OFFERING LIFE FROM
A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE,

17:59.912 --> 18:03.583
OUR VERY OWN QUEER GUY.

18:03.616 --> 18:06.586
- THANKS, JAKE.

18:06.619 --> 18:09.856
I'M EMMETT HONEYCUTT,
YOUR QUEER GUY,

18:09.889 --> 18:11.858
HERE TO GIVE YOU
INSIGHTS AND TIPS

18:11.891 --> 18:14.861
ON HOW TO MAKE
YOUR LIFE MORE FABUL--

18:14.894 --> 18:16.463
BETTER.

18:16.496 --> 18:17.764
- YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
HE WAS THE QUEER GUY

18:17.797 --> 18:19.866
FOR THE 700 CLUB.
- SHUSH!

18:19.899 --> 18:21.534
- SO, GUYS--
[clears throat]

18:21.568 --> 18:23.370
I MEAN, MEN,

18:23.403 --> 18:27.274
SAY YOU'RE ABOUT TO LEAN IN
A-AND KISS YOUR...GIRL.

18:27.307 --> 18:30.210
YOU'VE BRUSHED YOUR TEETH,
COMBED YOUR HAIR,

18:30.243 --> 18:32.479
EVEN SPLASHED ON
YOUR AFTERSHAVE.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.414
BUT DIDN'T YOU
FORGET SOMETHING?

18:34.447 --> 18:35.815
THAT'S RIGHT.

18:35.848 --> 18:38.551
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
THOSE PESKY NOSE HAIRS.

18:38.585 --> 18:41.421
NOTHING TURNS
THE LADIES OFF MORE

18:41.454 --> 18:44.691
THAN A JUNGLE
COMING OUT OF YOUR NOSTRILS.

18:44.724 --> 18:47.660
A HANDY PAIR OF SCISSORS
WILL DO THE TRICK.

18:47.694 --> 18:51.664
- NOSE HAIRS?
THAT'S HIS BIG OPENING NUMBER?

18:51.698 --> 18:53.366
I MEAN, WOULD
WEST SIDE STORY OPEN

18:53.400 --> 18:55.568
WITH THE SHARKS AND JETS
CLIPPING AWAY?

18:55.602 --> 18:58.838
WOULD FIDDLER OPEN WITH TEVYA
TRIMMING ON THE ROOF?

18:58.871 --> 19:00.273
WOULD PHANTOM OF THE OPERA
OPEN WITH--

19:00.307 --> 19:01.441
- GOT IT.

19:01.474 --> 19:02.675
- EXCUSE ME?

19:02.709 --> 19:03.943
- YEAH, HAVE A SEAT, HON.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.512
I'LL GET YOUR ORDER
IN A MINUTE.

19:05.545 --> 19:08.648
- I'D LIKE TO APPLY
FOR THE JOB.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.417
IN THE WINDOW?

19:10.450 --> 19:15.788
IT SAYS, "INQUIRE WITHIN."
SO I'M INQUIRING...

19:15.822 --> 19:18.425
WITHIN.

19:18.458 --> 19:19.792
- WELL, IN THAT CASE...

19:19.826 --> 19:22.829
- SO, GUYS...
- STEP INTO MY OFFICE.

19:22.862 --> 19:25.798
- NEXT DATE,
DON'T FORGET TO GARGLE.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.468
DON'T FORGET TO SNIP.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.803
BACK TO YOU, JAKE.

19:30.837 --> 19:34.274
- THANK YOU, QUEER GUY,
FOR THAT QUEER ADVICE.

19:34.307 --> 19:37.344
UP NEXT, ARE UMBRELLAS
IN OUR FUTURE?

19:37.377 --> 19:40.447
JOHNNY MEMPHIS WILL BE HERE
WITH THE FIVE-DAY FORECAST.

19:40.480 --> 19:43.683
- MY NAME'S LORETTA PYE.
WITH A "Y."

19:43.716 --> 19:47.354
- I'M DEBBIE.
WITH AN "I-E".

19:47.387 --> 19:50.323
SO, LORETTA, Y-YOU DONE
MUCH WAITRESSING?

19:50.357 --> 19:52.359
- WELL, DOES WAITING
ON MY HUSBAND COUNT?

19:52.392 --> 19:53.960
- IT DEPENDS ON THE TIPS.

19:53.993 --> 19:55.995
- NOT TOO GOOD.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.598
OTHER THAN THAT, I HAVEN'T
HAD MUCH EXPERIENCE,

19:58.631 --> 20:03.403
BUT, UM--
BUT NOW, I NEED A JOB.

20:04.604 --> 20:09.442
- DID YOUR HUSBAND PASS ON?

20:09.476 --> 20:11.878
- OH, UM...

20:11.911 --> 20:14.514
HE'S VERY MUCH ALIVE.

20:14.547 --> 20:18.485
HE THREW ME OUT.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.320
HE CAME HOME
UNEXPECTEDLY FROM WORK,

20:20.353 --> 20:23.256
AND HE CAUGHT ME
KISSING MY FRIEND, SHERILYN.

20:23.290 --> 20:24.757
WE WERE MAKING
CINNAMON BUNS.

20:24.791 --> 20:26.593
YOU KNOW,
IT WAS A ONE-TIME THING.

20:26.626 --> 20:29.329
I MEAN, SHE'S MARRIED,
SHE'S GOT THREE KIDS.

20:29.362 --> 20:31.631
IT WAS SPUR OF THE MOMENT.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.600
I MEAN, WE WERE LICKING
THE ICING SPOON,

20:33.633 --> 20:37.670
AND ONE LICK
LED TO ANOTHER, AND--

20:37.704 --> 20:40.473
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD YOU
ALL THAT.

20:40.507 --> 20:42.475
HE ALWAYS SAID
I TALK TOO MUCH.

20:42.509 --> 20:44.744
- YOU CAN SAY
WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT.

20:44.777 --> 20:49.416
HELL, YOU OUGHT
TO HEAR ME.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.951
BUT, UM, LISTEN,
WORKING HERE ISN'T EASY.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.753
YOU KNOW, THERE'S--
THERE'S TAKING ORDERS,

20:53.786 --> 20:55.355
THERE'S BALANCING PLATES,
THERE'S MAKING SURE

20:55.388 --> 20:58.625
THE CUSTOMERS KEEP
THEIR PANTS ON, LITERALLY.

20:58.658 --> 21:00.059
- I'M A REAL FAST LEARNER.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.495
ALL MY TEACHERS AT SCHOOL
USED TO SAY SO.

21:02.529 --> 21:04.631
AND I PROMISE
I'LL WORK HARD.

21:04.664 --> 21:06.299
- MAYBE SO, HONEY,
IT'S JUST--

21:06.333 --> 21:07.767
- OKAY, LOOK.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.770
I KNOW I DON'T HAVE
ANY QUALIFICATIONS.

21:10.803 --> 21:15.642
IT'S JUST THAT I ALSO KNOW
I CAN'T GO HOME.

21:15.675 --> 21:19.979
SO IF YOU COULD
JUST GIVE ME A CHANCE.

21:26.819 --> 21:29.288
FRESHEN YOUR CUP?

21:33.092 --> 21:35.928
- [laughs]

21:35.962 --> 21:37.464
- NOW, IT USED TO BE
THE DEFINITION

21:37.497 --> 21:38.965
OF A MOTHER WAS SIMPLE.

21:38.998 --> 21:41.734
IT WAS THE DEAR LADY
WHO GAVE BIRTH TO YOU.

21:41.768 --> 21:44.871
SHE WIPED YOUR NOSE,
SHE BAKED YOU BROWNIES, AND WHO,

21:44.904 --> 21:46.806
ONCE A YEAR, YOU SENT
AN ESPECIALLY TOUCHING

21:46.839 --> 21:48.408
HALLMARK GREETING TO,
THANKING HER

21:48.441 --> 21:50.810
FOR HER ENDLESS SACRIFICES.
- [chuckles]

21:50.843 --> 21:52.412
- BUT THESE DAYS,
IT'S MORE COMPLICATED.

21:52.445 --> 21:54.881
IT'S BIOLOGICAL MOTHERS,
SURROGATE MOTHERS,

21:54.914 --> 21:56.683
LESBIAN MOTHERS.

21:56.716 --> 21:58.818
SOON YOU'LL BE SENDING
A CARD TO YOURSELF.

21:58.851 --> 22:01.688
"THANKS FOR CLONING ME."

22:01.721 --> 22:02.889
I DIGRESS.

22:02.922 --> 22:05.425
LET'S, UH,
GET BACK TO YOUR CASE.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.760
- WELL, I'M NOT SURE I HAVE ONE.
- I AM.

22:07.794 --> 22:09.696
OTHERWISE, I WOULDN'T
BE WASTING MY TIME

22:09.729 --> 22:11.097
OR BRIAN'S MONEY.

22:11.130 --> 22:12.699
IN FACT, I'D SAY
YOU HAVE A DAMN GOOD ONE,

22:12.732 --> 22:14.834
BASED ON
WHAT YOU'VE TOLD ME.

22:14.867 --> 22:17.870
- YOU'RE NOT GOING TO USE
WHAT I TOLD YOU?

22:17.904 --> 22:19.105
- EVERYTHING
WE'VE DISCUSSED HERE IS,

22:19.138 --> 22:21.741
OF COURSE, CONFIDENTIAL.

22:21.774 --> 22:24.110
BUT I'D BE A FOOL
AND A LOUSY LAWYER IF I DIDN'T.

22:24.143 --> 22:26.145
- YOU MUSTN'T.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.481
I SAID SUCH AWFUL THINGS
ABOUT BOTH OF THEM.

22:28.515 --> 22:29.482
- WELL, THEY'RE TRUE,
AREN'T THEY?

22:29.516 --> 22:30.650
- WELL, YES, BUT--

22:30.683 --> 22:31.884
- THEN HOW DO YOU
EXPECT TO PROVE

22:31.918 --> 22:33.486
YOU'RE JUST AS QUALIFIED

22:33.520 --> 22:35.788
TO BE JENNY REBECCA'S PARENT
AS THEY ARE,

22:35.822 --> 22:38.858
AND TO SHARE
IN THE CUSTODY?

22:38.891 --> 22:40.593
- BUT MELANIE'S MY PARTNER--
- WAS.

22:40.627 --> 22:42.128
- AND MICHAEL'S A DEAR,
CLOSE FRIEND.

22:42.161 --> 22:44.631
WE CHOSE HIM TO BE
OUR BABY'S FATHER.

22:44.664 --> 22:49.001
- ONLY THEY'VE BETRAYED YOU
AND NOW YOU CAN'T TRUST THEM.

22:49.035 --> 22:51.971
WHICH IS WHY
YOU'VE COME TO ME.

22:54.907 --> 22:58.878
- MR. GABRIEL,
IF I SAY THESE THINGS,

22:58.911 --> 23:02.615
THE THINGS
YOU WANT ME TO SAY,

23:02.649 --> 23:06.819
THEY'LL NEVER FORGIVE ME--
NEVER.

23:06.853 --> 23:10.022
- WELL, IT'S A LITTLE LATE
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.624
BESIDES, WE'RE NOT HERE
TO MAKE FRIENDS.

23:11.658 --> 23:13.159
- BUT TO STOOP THAT LOW?

23:13.192 --> 23:15.928
- THAT'S WHY YOU
GOT YOURSELF A LAWYER,

23:15.962 --> 23:19.131
SO YOU WON'T HAVE TO.

23:26.539 --> 23:29.041
- DID YOU SEE THAT?
- WHAT?

23:29.075 --> 23:32.845
- I'M GETTING CRUISED
BY EVERYBODY.

23:32.879 --> 23:34.514
- DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU
THEY JUST MIGHT BE

23:34.547 --> 23:36.716
LOOKING AT ME?

23:36.749 --> 23:39.051
PROBABLY TO ASK IF I NEED HELP
CROSSING THE STREET.

23:39.085 --> 23:40.953
- [scoffs]
WOULD YOU CUT IT OUT?

23:40.987 --> 23:43.556
YOU LOOK GREAT
FOR YOUR AGE.

23:43.590 --> 23:46.859
I MEAN, FOR ANY AGE.

23:46.893 --> 23:50.196
OH, I GUESS THEY MUST RECOGNIZE
ME FROM THE NEWS.

23:50.229 --> 23:51.731
UNLESS ONE'S IN THE MEDIA,
ONE DOESN'T REALIZE

23:51.764 --> 23:54.200
THE IMPACT TELEVISION
HAS ON ONE.

23:54.233 --> 23:55.668
- ONE ALSO DOESN'T REALIZE
HOW ANNOYING

23:55.702 --> 23:57.069
THE USE OF THE WORD "ONE"
CAN BE WHEN ONE

23:57.103 --> 23:59.005
KEEPS REPEATING IT.

23:59.038 --> 24:01.741
- ALL RIGHT,
MR. GRUMPY-PUSS.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.543
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER
ONCE WE GET TO POPPERZ.

24:03.576 --> 24:05.244
- YOU MEAN YOU WILL.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.680
STANDING NEXT TO ME, YOU'LL LOOK
AT LEAST TEN YEARS YOUNGER.

24:07.714 --> 24:10.950
- OH, GOD.

24:10.983 --> 24:13.820
HEY, POPPERZ IS THIS WAY.

24:13.853 --> 24:15.221
- AND BABYLON IS THIS WAY.

24:15.254 --> 24:17.990
- BUT WE DON'T WANT
TO GO TO BABYLON.

24:18.024 --> 24:20.627
- I HAVE TO STOP BY
AND GIVE BRIAN A BODY COUNT.

24:20.660 --> 24:23.630
- APT TERM FOR A MORGUE.

24:23.663 --> 24:25.097
ALL RIGHT,
IT SHOULDN'T TAKE LONG.

24:25.131 --> 24:28.735
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO COUNT THEM
ON ONE HAND.

24:28.768 --> 24:30.870
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

24:30.903 --> 24:33.840
- BRIAN'S PROBABLY GIVING
BLOW JOBS TO GET CUSTOMERS.

24:33.873 --> 24:35.575
HONESTLY,
HE HAS NO SHAME.

24:35.608 --> 24:37.577
- YOU. NOT YOU.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.145
NOT YOU. YOU.

24:39.178 --> 24:40.913
- HEY!
WHY CAN'T I GET IN?

24:40.947 --> 24:44.584
- OH, LET HIM IN...
ON TROLL TUESDAY.

24:44.617 --> 24:46.619
- HEY, CHECK IT OUT, IT'S
THE QUEER GUY FROM THE NEWS.

24:46.653 --> 24:48.254
- WHERE DID ALL THESE GUYS
COME FROM?

24:48.287 --> 24:51.591
- SEEMS LIKE BABYLON
IS ONCE AGAIN THE PLACE TO BE.

24:51.624 --> 24:54.260
- YOU. NOT YOU.
NOT YOU.

24:54.293 --> 24:55.728
YOU.

24:55.762 --> 24:57.764
- BRRR.

24:57.797 --> 25:00.266
IT'S CHILLY OUT HERE.

25:00.299 --> 25:03.603
SHALL WE GO IN?
- LET'S.

25:03.636 --> 25:07.607
- WHOA, NOT YOU.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.008
- EXCUSE ME?

25:09.041 --> 25:11.878
DO YOU REALIZE
WHO I AM?

25:11.911 --> 25:14.647
I HAPPEN TO BE
THE CHANNEL 5 QUEER GUY,

25:14.681 --> 25:19.218
WHICH MAKES ME A VERY IMPORTANT
HOMOSEXUAL PERSON.

25:19.251 --> 25:21.888
- EACH OF US,
IN HIS OWN WAY,

25:21.921 --> 25:24.290
IS UNIQUE AND BEAUTIFUL
AND SPECIAL.

25:24.323 --> 25:28.695
BUT THAT DIDN'T
GET THEM IN EITHER.

25:28.728 --> 25:30.930
- [scoffs]

25:33.666 --> 25:35.935
- NOT YOU. NOT YOU.
YOU.

25:35.968 --> 25:39.038
- THERE'S NOBODY HERE.

25:39.071 --> 25:41.340
- HERE YOU GO, BOYS.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.843
100 FOR YOU.
- THANKS.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.778
- 100 FOR YOU.
- THANKS.

25:45.812 --> 25:47.179
- 100 FOR YOU.
- YEAH, THANKS.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.716
- AND 100 FOR YOU.
- THANKS.

25:49.749 --> 25:51.217
- YOU HIRED THOSE GUYS?

25:51.250 --> 25:53.319
- THEY SEEM TO BE DRAWING
A NICE CROWD.

25:53.352 --> 25:56.122
- ALL RIGHT, SEE, THE CONCEPT
IS WE WANT PEOPLE TO COME IN.

25:56.155 --> 25:57.690
- WELL, WHAT'S THE RUSH?

25:57.724 --> 25:59.659
- IN L.A., THEY'D
STAND IN LINE ALL NIGHT.

25:59.692 --> 26:02.328
- THIS ISN'T L.A.
- THEODORE...

26:02.361 --> 26:04.931
PERMIT ME TO EXPLAIN
SOMETHING.

26:04.964 --> 26:09.368
FAGS ARE NO DIFFERENT
THAN PEOPLE.

26:09.401 --> 26:10.870
YOU TELL THEM
THEY CAN'T HAVE SOMETHING,

26:10.903 --> 26:11.938
AND IT'S ALL THEY WANT.

26:11.971 --> 26:13.205
AND THEY WON'T GIVE UP

26:13.239 --> 26:15.307
UNTIL THEY GET IT.

26:19.378 --> 26:22.214
NOW, SHALL WE STEP OUTSIDE
AND ALLOW

26:22.248 --> 26:26.719
A FEW MORE OF
THE "BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE" IN?

26:33.760 --> 26:36.128
- TWO PINK PLATE SPECIALS.

26:36.162 --> 26:39.365
- [mouths silently]
- ENJOY IT.

26:39.398 --> 26:41.267
MY KNEES ARE SHAKING.
I'M A NERVOUS WRECK.

26:41.300 --> 26:42.735
- YOU'RE DOING FINE.

26:42.769 --> 26:43.870
- WHERE'S OUR FOOD?

26:43.903 --> 26:45.137
WE ORDERED IT
A YEAR AGO.

26:45.171 --> 26:46.138
- LORETTA.
[bell dings]

26:46.172 --> 26:47.139
- IT'S UP NOW.

26:47.173 --> 26:49.742
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

26:49.776 --> 26:52.912
OH, GOD, WHICH IS WHICH?
THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.146
- YOU'D LOOK LIKE THIS TOO

26:54.180 --> 26:55.982
IF YOU HAD MELTED CHEESE
ALL OVER YOU.

26:56.015 --> 26:58.384
THAT'S A TUNA MELT,
THAT'S A CHICKEN MELT,

26:58.417 --> 26:59.385
THAT'S A VEGGIE MELT.

26:59.418 --> 27:00.987
TUNA, CHICKEN,

27:01.020 --> 27:02.121
both: VEGGIE.

27:02.154 --> 27:03.122
THANK YOU.

27:03.155 --> 27:06.392
[mouthing silently]

27:06.425 --> 27:10.863
VEGGIE, CHICKEN, AND TUNA.
ENJOY.

27:10.897 --> 27:13.132
- HEY, I DON'T WANT FRIES.

27:13.165 --> 27:14.400
I'M WATCHING MY CARBS.

27:14.433 --> 27:16.035
BRING ME SOME SLAW.

27:16.068 --> 27:18.037
- OOH.

27:20.439 --> 27:23.009
- I GUESS YOU'LL BE DOING
EXTRA CRUNCHES AT THE GYM,

27:23.042 --> 27:25.144
'CAUSE WE DON'T SUBSTITUTE
UNLESS THERE'S A "PLEASE"

27:25.177 --> 27:26.746
WITH THE REQUEST.

27:26.779 --> 27:29.816
ENJOY.

27:29.849 --> 27:31.183
MOST OF THESE BOYS
ARE PRINCES.

27:31.217 --> 27:32.451
ONCE IN A WHILE,
YOU GET A QUEEN,

27:32.484 --> 27:34.754
AND WHEN YOU DO,
YOU JUST GOT TO TELL HIM

27:34.787 --> 27:37.156
WHERE TO STICK
HIS SCEPTER.

27:37.189 --> 27:38.290
- I DON'T KNOW
IF I COULD DO THAT.

27:38.324 --> 27:39.692
- WAITRESS!

27:39.726 --> 27:41.027
- THIS IS A DINER, HONEY.

27:41.060 --> 27:42.962
IT'S KILL OR BE KILLED.

27:42.995 --> 27:44.363
- WAITRESS!
[snaps fingers]

27:44.396 --> 27:46.332
CHRIST, IS SOMEBODY
GOING TO WAIT ON ME,

27:46.365 --> 27:51.070
OR DO I HAVE TO SIT HERE FOR
THREE DAYS, LIKE THE LEMON BARS?

27:51.103 --> 27:52.905
- "KILL OR BE KILLED."

27:52.939 --> 27:54.440
- WELL?

27:54.473 --> 27:55.775
ARE YOU GOING
TO STAND THERE AND POSE

27:55.808 --> 27:56.909
OR ARE YOU
GOING TO TAKE MY ORDER?

27:56.943 --> 27:58.911
- THAT'LL BE A MILKSHAKE

27:58.945 --> 28:01.313
AND A BOWL
OF CHICKEN BROTH.

28:01.347 --> 28:02.949
- WHY WOULD I WANT THAT?

28:02.982 --> 28:04.917
- BECAUSE THE NEXT TIME
YOU SNAP YOUR FINGERS AT ME,

28:04.951 --> 28:06.853
THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING
TO BE ABLE TO SUCK ANYTHING

28:06.886 --> 28:09.822
IS THROUGH A STRAW!

28:13.960 --> 28:16.328
- BY GEORGE,
SHE'S FUCKING GOT IT.

28:16.362 --> 28:18.865
YES!

28:18.898 --> 28:20.332
- [whispers]
THANK YOU.

28:20.366 --> 28:24.937
[mixed chatter]

28:24.971 --> 28:28.374
- DON?
DON, GOT A MINUTE?

28:30.242 --> 28:32.845
I'VE AN IDEA FOR MY NEXT SEGMENT
I'D LIKE TO RUN BY YOU.

28:32.879 --> 28:35.214
[chuckles]
HEY, BUDDY.

28:35.247 --> 28:37.950
ALREADY STARTING TO FEEL
LIKE A MEMBER OF THE TEAM.

28:37.984 --> 28:40.386
UH, NOW THEN,
I'D LIKE TO EXPLORE

28:40.419 --> 28:42.088
A SELDOM-SPOKEN-OF CONDITION
THAT PLAGUES

28:42.121 --> 28:43.489
OVER 40% OF ALL STRAIGHT MEN.

28:43.522 --> 28:45.024
- AN ENLARGED PROSTATE?

28:45.057 --> 28:47.159
- WEARING BROWN SHOES
WITH BLACK SLACKS.

28:47.193 --> 28:49.228
A COMMON FASHION
FAUX PAS THAT,

28:49.261 --> 28:51.831
HUMILIATING AS IT MAY BE,
CAN BE EASILY CORRECTED.

28:51.864 --> 28:54.801
- HUMILIATING, HUH?

28:56.202 --> 28:59.505
- W--EXCEPT ON SOME MEN,
SUCH AS YOURSELF,

28:59.538 --> 29:02.241
WHO HAVE THE SELF-CONFIDENCE
TO CARRY IT OFF.

29:02.274 --> 29:03.976
- LOOK, EMMETT,
I'M SORRY,

29:04.010 --> 29:06.846
BUT AFTER TOMORROW,
THE QUEER GUY'S CANCELLED.

29:06.879 --> 29:09.882
- YOU--CANCELLED?
- YEP.

29:09.916 --> 29:11.851
- BUT I-I-I'VE ONLY
BEEN ON ONCE.

29:11.884 --> 29:13.853
- THAT WAS ENOUGH.
THE AUDIENCE DIDN'T BUY IT

29:13.886 --> 29:15.521
AND NEITHER DID MANAGEMENT.

29:15.554 --> 29:17.523
LOOK, WE WANTED A QUEER GUY,

29:17.556 --> 29:21.894
AND FRANKLY,
YOU'RE JUST NOT QUEER ENOUGH.

29:28.167 --> 29:30.002
- MY CLIENT
WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION

29:30.036 --> 29:33.039
THAT MS. PETERSON HAD AGREED
TO WORK OUT A CUSTODY AGREEMENT

29:33.072 --> 29:35.574
OF THEIR OWN, AFTER MATTERS
BETWEEN MS. MARCUS

29:35.607 --> 29:37.810
AND MR. NOVOTNY
WERE SETTLED.

29:37.844 --> 29:39.345
- AND WHY SHOULD MY CLIENT
TRUST MS. MARCUS

29:39.378 --> 29:41.147
TO CONSIDER HER INTERESTS

29:41.180 --> 29:43.883
WHEN SHE ENLISTED YOUR SERVICES
WITHOUT HER KNOWLEDGE?

29:43.916 --> 29:45.151
- AND CONSIDERING
THEY'RE IN THE MIDST

29:45.184 --> 29:47.019
OF WHAT WE COULD LABEL
A DIVORCE,

29:47.053 --> 29:48.587
MS. PETERSON
HAS EVERY REASON AND RIGHT

29:48.620 --> 29:50.289
TO ENGAGE HER OWN
LEGAL COUNSEL.

29:50.322 --> 29:52.291
- ALL RIGHT, TOM,
I THINK WE CAN ACCEPT

29:52.324 --> 29:53.559
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE HERE

29:53.592 --> 29:55.427
AND HAVE NO INTENTIONS
OF LEAVING.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.296
HOWEVER, I WOULD LIKE
TO POINT OUT

29:57.329 --> 30:00.232
THAT YOUR CLIENT HAS NO
LEGAL CLAIMS TO THIS CHILD

30:00.266 --> 30:02.168
SINCE SHE'S NEITHER
THE BIOLOGICAL

30:02.201 --> 30:04.170
NOR THE ADOPTIVE MOTHER.

30:04.203 --> 30:05.972
- COME ON, BOBBI.

30:06.005 --> 30:07.907
SHE LIVED IN A COMMON LAW
ARRANGEMENT WITH YOUR CLIENT

30:07.940 --> 30:09.108
FOR TEN YEARS.

30:09.141 --> 30:10.843
THEY HAD A COMMITMENT
CEREMONY.

30:10.877 --> 30:13.312
SHE WAS THE PRIMARY CAREGIVER
OF THEIR FIRST CHILD.

30:13.345 --> 30:15.514
SHE INSEMINATED YOUR CLIENT
WITH MR. NOVOTNY'S SPERM,

30:15.547 --> 30:17.116
SUPPORTED HER THROUGH
HER PREGNANCY.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.918
- WHILE SHE
WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR.

30:18.951 --> 30:20.586
- IT'S A SINGLE
SEXUAL ENCOUNTER.

30:20.619 --> 30:22.855
- OH, I-I DIDN'T REALIZE
JUST ONE TIME DOESN'T COUNT.

30:22.889 --> 30:25.057
- FOR WHICH I HAVE APOLOGIZED
AD NAUSEAM.

30:25.091 --> 30:26.859
- I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT
THAT MS. MARCUS

30:26.893 --> 30:28.460
HAS ENGAGED
IN HER OWN INFIDELITIES.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.062
- THAT WAS BEFORE
WE WERE MARRIED.

30:30.096 --> 30:32.064
- EXCUSE ME, BUT WHAT THE HELL
HAS AN AFFAIR

30:32.098 --> 30:34.533
GOT TO DO
WITH BEING A GOOD PARENT?

30:34.566 --> 30:36.235
- MORE TO THE POINT.

30:36.268 --> 30:39.471
MS. MARCUS, ON MORE
THAN ONE OCCASION,

30:39.505 --> 30:41.941
HAS ENDANGERED THE LIFE
OF HER UNBORN CHILD...

30:41.974 --> 30:44.977
BY REFUSING TO LISTEN
TO HER OWN DOCTOR'S ORDERS,

30:45.011 --> 30:46.345
OVER-WORKING TO THE POINT
OF EXHAUSTION,

30:46.378 --> 30:47.479
ALMOST CAUSING A MISCARRIAGE.

30:47.513 --> 30:50.616
- IS THAT WHAT YOU SAID?

30:50.649 --> 30:52.118
THAT'S A GODDAMN
EXAGGERATION.

30:52.151 --> 30:53.953
- MEL.
- NO, I WAS FINE.

30:53.986 --> 30:55.154
- YOU WERE NOT FINE.

30:55.187 --> 30:56.422
- WHICH HARDLY
QUALIFIES HER

30:56.455 --> 30:57.656
AS A BETTER MOTHER
THAN MS. PETERSON,

30:57.689 --> 31:00.126
BIOLOGICAL OR OTHERWISE.

31:00.159 --> 31:02.428
IN FACT, AS BIOLOGICAL MOTHER
OF THEIR FIRST CHILD,

31:02.461 --> 31:04.163
I'D SAY MY CLIENT
WAS MORE QUALIFIED

31:04.196 --> 31:06.298
THAN EITHER MS. MARCUS
OR MR. NOVOTNY.

31:06.332 --> 31:09.101
- EXPERIENCE IS NOT
A QUALIFICATION FOR PARENTHOOD.

31:09.135 --> 31:11.971
WHAT FIRST-TIME PARENT
HAS EXPERIENCE?

31:12.004 --> 31:13.439
YOU LEARN ON THE JOB.

31:13.472 --> 31:16.508
THE FACT REMAINS
THAT YOUR CLIENT HAS NO CLAIMS,

31:16.542 --> 31:18.978
BIOLOGICAL OR LEGAL.

31:19.011 --> 31:20.246
- WHAT SHE HAS
IS A MORAL CLAIM.

31:20.279 --> 31:22.314
IT'S FAR MORE
THAN MR. NOVOTNY.

31:22.348 --> 31:25.117
WELL, LET'S FACE IT,
HE'S A SPERM DONOR

31:25.151 --> 31:27.119
WITH AN OVER-INFLATED SENSE
OF HIS OWN CONTRIBUTION--

31:27.153 --> 31:28.320
- HEY!

31:28.354 --> 31:29.321
- AS WELL AS BEING
MORALLY UNFIT.

31:29.355 --> 31:31.123
- WHAT ARE YOU IMPLYING?

31:31.157 --> 31:32.992
- HE LIVES
WITH TWO HIV-POSITIVE MEN,

31:33.025 --> 31:35.394
ONE OF WHOM
IS A MALE PROSTITUTE.

31:35.427 --> 31:37.896
- IS THAT WHAT YOU TOLD HIM?

31:40.032 --> 31:44.403
HE'S A FORMER PROSTITUTE
WHO WAS ABUSED BY HIS MOTHER!

31:44.436 --> 31:47.073
- MR. NOVOTNY ALSO HAS A HISTORY
OF RECREATIONAL DRUG USE,

31:47.106 --> 31:49.475
ATTENDING KNOWN GAY
SEXUAL ESTABLISHMENTS,

31:49.508 --> 31:51.543
WHO MAKES HIS LIVING
BY WRITING A VIOLENT,

31:51.577 --> 31:53.479
PORNOGRAPHIC COMIC BOOK.

31:53.512 --> 31:55.481
I BELIEVE IT WOULD TAKE
A LOT TO CONVINCE A JUDGE

31:55.514 --> 31:59.918
THAT HE HAS MORE RIGHTS
TO THIS BABY THAN MS. PETERSON.

32:05.591 --> 32:09.028
- THANKS A LOT, LINDSAY.

32:09.061 --> 32:11.697
- SO, WE HAVE TWO CHOICES.

32:11.730 --> 32:13.699
WE CAN EITHER WORK OUT
AN EQUITABLE AGREEMENT

32:13.732 --> 32:18.437
BETWEEN JENNY REBECCA'S
THREE PARENTS...

32:18.470 --> 32:21.707
OR WE CAN GO TO COURT
AND LET A JUDGE RESOLVE THIS.

32:21.740 --> 32:24.676
IT'S YOUR DECISION.

32:29.081 --> 32:30.582
- LIPO.

32:30.616 --> 32:31.650
LIPO.

32:31.683 --> 32:34.453
BUTT LIFT.

32:34.486 --> 32:36.188
LIPO AND BROW LIFT.

32:36.222 --> 32:38.457
- HEY, WHY DON'T YOU TRY
DOING A LITTLE WORK

32:38.490 --> 32:40.259
INSTEAD OF COUNTING
WHO'S HAD WORK DONE?

32:40.292 --> 32:42.528
- AND THE POINT
OF THAT WOULD BE?

32:42.561 --> 32:45.731
- TO KEEP YOUR BODY, MIND,
AND SPIRIT HEALTHY AND IN SHAPE.

32:45.764 --> 32:47.366
- [scoffs]

32:47.399 --> 32:49.135
- OF COURSE, I, PERSONALLY,
DON'T NEED IT.

32:49.168 --> 32:51.470
I ONLY DO THIS SO GUYS
CAN CHECK OUT MY ASS.

32:51.503 --> 32:52.738
[grunts]

32:52.771 --> 32:55.207
- [laughs]

32:55.241 --> 32:57.676
- YEAH, WELL, CHECK BACK WITH ME
WHEN YOU'RE 38--5,

32:57.709 --> 33:01.547
AND THE SUN HAS BEGUN TO SET
ON YOUR ENDLESS SUMMER.

33:01.580 --> 33:04.083
- I MEAN, I'VE BEEN COMING
TO THE GYM THREE TIMES A WEEK

33:04.116 --> 33:05.551
FOR 18 YEARS.

33:05.584 --> 33:08.420
SO THAT'S,
LET'S SEE, UH...

33:08.454 --> 33:11.390
12 TIMES A MONTH
TIMES 18...

33:11.423 --> 33:14.626
2,116 HOURS
SPENT IN THE GYM.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.228
AND LOOK AT ME.

33:16.262 --> 33:17.763
I'M EXACTLY THE SAME.
I TAKE THAT BACK.

33:17.796 --> 33:20.132
ACTUALLY, THERE'S MORE OF ME
INSTEAD OF LESS OF ME.

33:20.166 --> 33:22.501
AND NOT WHERE
I WANT IT TO BE.

33:22.534 --> 33:23.802
SO WHY NOT JUST HAVE
A LITTLE SNIP-AND-CLIP

33:23.835 --> 33:25.804
AND BE DONE WITH IT?

33:29.675 --> 33:32.111
- I'VE BEEN CANCELLED!

33:32.144 --> 33:34.513
AFTER TODAY,
THE QUEER GUY'S GONE.

33:34.546 --> 33:36.248
AND DO YOU KNOW WHY?

33:36.282 --> 33:39.651
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT
I WASN'T QUEER ENOUGH. ME!

33:39.685 --> 33:41.453
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN
CALLED MANY, MANY THINGS,

33:41.487 --> 33:45.557
BUT NEVER
"NOT QUEER ENOUGH."

33:45.591 --> 33:48.794
- IT'S NOT ONLY UNCONSCIONABLE,
IT'S UNFATHOMABLE.

33:48.827 --> 33:50.529
- I MEAN, YOU SAW ME.

33:50.562 --> 33:52.698
WAS I NOT THE QUEEREST THING
ON GOD'S EARTH?

33:52.731 --> 33:54.533
- ACTUALLY, YOU SEEMED
A LITTLE BIT--

33:54.566 --> 33:56.735
- RESERVED.

33:56.768 --> 33:58.537
- RESERVED?

33:58.570 --> 34:02.341
WELL, UH, YOU KNOW, JUST NOT
YOUR USUAL FLAMBOYANT SELF.

34:02.374 --> 34:05.144
- WELL, I'M A NEWSMAN NOW.

34:05.177 --> 34:08.680
I-I HAD TO LOWER
THE FLAME A BIT.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.582
I-I MEAN, I FIGURED
IF I WAS TOO FLAMBOYANT,

34:10.616 --> 34:12.151
I MIGHT TURN PEOPLE OFF.

34:12.184 --> 34:14.720
- YEAH, WELL, INSTEAD,
THEY TURNED YOU OFF.

34:14.753 --> 34:18.190
I BELIEVE THERE'S
A PROFOUND LIFE LESSON IN THIS.

34:18.224 --> 34:19.691
- THEY HIRED YOU
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT

34:19.725 --> 34:21.427
SOME STIFF STRAIGHT GUY
WHO LOOKS LIKE

34:21.460 --> 34:22.828
HE HAS A POKER UP HIS ASS.

34:22.861 --> 34:24.496
- THEY WANTED SOME GAY GUY
WHO LOOKED LIKE

34:24.530 --> 34:25.864
HE HAD A FIST UP HIS ASS.

34:25.897 --> 34:28.700
- THEY WANTED YOU,
EMMETT HONEYCUTT.

34:28.734 --> 34:32.238
- THE QUEEREST, NELLIEST
HO-HO-HOMO

34:32.271 --> 34:36.408
IN THE HO-HO-WHOLE
WIDE WORLD.

34:42.248 --> 34:44.316
- YOU HAVEN'T TOUCHED
YOUR DRINK.

34:44.350 --> 34:46.318
- I DIDN'T BUY IT
TO DRINK.

34:46.352 --> 34:49.255
I BOUGHT IT TO STARE INTO,
DEJECTEDLY.

34:49.288 --> 34:51.723
- YOU'RE DOING
A HELL OF A JOB.

34:51.757 --> 34:54.626
- NOT HALF THE JOB
THAT LINDSAY'S LAWYER DID ON ME.

34:54.660 --> 34:58.730
HE MADE ME SOUND LIKE
SOME KIND OF DEPRAVED DRUG USER,

34:58.764 --> 35:01.600
A PORNOGRAPHER,
A SEX FIEND.

35:01.633 --> 35:03.469
- DON'T CHANGE
YOUR HAIR FOR ME,

35:03.502 --> 35:04.503
NOT IF YOU CARE FOR ME.

35:04.536 --> 35:06.638
- FUCK OFF!

35:06.672 --> 35:08.807
- NICE TO SEE YOU TOO.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.742
OUT ENJOYING YOURSELVES.

35:10.776 --> 35:13.479
ALTHOUGH, NOW THAT YOU'VE
SETTLED INTO DOMESTIC BLISS,

35:13.512 --> 35:14.746
I ASSUMED
YOU NO LONGER FREQUENTED

35:14.780 --> 35:16.682
SUCH DUBIOUS ESTABLISHMENTS.

35:16.715 --> 35:18.884
- NOTHING WRONG WITH HAVING
A DRINK WITH OUR FRIENDS.

35:18.917 --> 35:23.622
- YEAH, NOTICE, KEYWORD:
"FRIENDS."

35:23.655 --> 35:28.227
YOU HIRED THAT LAWYER
FOR LINDSAY, DIDN'T YOU?

35:28.260 --> 35:29.895
NEVER MIND, IT'S OBVIOUS.
HOW ELSE COULD SHE AFFORD HIM?

35:29.928 --> 35:31.530
SHE CAN BARELY AFFORD
HER APARTMENT.

35:31.563 --> 35:33.532
- IF BRIAN WANTS TO PAY
FOR LINDSAY'S LAWYER,

35:33.565 --> 35:35.767
IT'S HIS MONEY
AND NONE OF OUR BUSINESS.

35:35.801 --> 35:37.303
- WELL SAID, PROFESSOR.

35:37.336 --> 35:38.770
- THE HELL IT'S NOT!

35:38.804 --> 35:41.507
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.
I THOUGHT, MY BEST FRIEND.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.775
- I AM.
- THEN WHY ARE YOU HELPING HER?

35:43.809 --> 35:45.444
- I WOULD'VE DONE THE SAME
FOR YOU.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.179
- WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR ME
IS STAY THE HELL OUT OF IT.

35:47.213 --> 35:48.847
THANKS TO YOUR
UNBIASED GENEROSITY,

35:48.880 --> 35:52.251
WE'RE NOW SPLITTING
JENNY REBECCA THREE WAYS.

35:52.284 --> 35:54.386
- ALL THESE GAYS HAVING KIDS.

35:54.420 --> 35:57.823
NOW, I ASK YOU,
WHAT'S THE WORLD COMING TO?

35:57.856 --> 36:00.526
LINDSAY'S HER PARENT TOO.

36:00.559 --> 36:02.461
SHE HAS AS MUCH RIGHT
TO SHARE CUSTODY

36:02.494 --> 36:05.364
AS YOU AND MEL.

36:11.637 --> 36:12.971
- YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES, I SWEAR,

36:13.004 --> 36:14.273
IT'S LIKE I DON'T EVEN KNOW

36:14.306 --> 36:16.675
WHO THE FUCK HE IS ANY MORE.

36:16.708 --> 36:21.613
[mixed chatter]

36:26.618 --> 36:28.320
- BE SURE TO SCHEDULE
THOSE QUEER GUYS FOR TOMORROW.

36:28.354 --> 36:30.556
OKAY?

36:30.589 --> 36:33.225
OKAY, EVERYBODY.
[claps]

36:33.259 --> 36:34.693
- PLACES, EVERYONE.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.428
AND WE'RE BACK
FROM COMMERCIAL

36:36.462 --> 36:39.431
IN FIVE, FOUR,

36:39.465 --> 36:41.833
THREE, TWO,

36:41.867 --> 36:44.903
ONE.

36:44.936 --> 36:48.006
HI, I'M EMMETT HONEYCUTT,
YOUR QUEER GUY,

36:48.039 --> 36:50.709
AND CERTIFIED MEMBER
OF THE 4 "F" CLUB.

36:50.742 --> 36:54.012
THAT'S FASHION, FOOD,
FURNISHINGS AND, UH...

36:54.045 --> 36:55.747
WE'LL SAVE THE LAST "F"
FOR CABLE.

36:55.781 --> 36:57.849
NOW, FOR MY FINAL SEGMENT,

36:57.883 --> 37:00.652
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU
HOW A LITTLE FAIRY DUST

37:00.686 --> 37:05.324
CAN TRANSFORM EVEN
THE MOST HOPELESS OF HETEROS.

37:05.357 --> 37:08.527
OH, HERE'S A
SORRY SPECIMEN.

37:08.560 --> 37:09.595
AND, UH, YOU ARE?

37:09.628 --> 37:11.597
- UH, CLEM.
- CLEM?

37:11.630 --> 37:12.798
IS THAT SHORT
FOR CLEMENTINE?

37:12.831 --> 37:16.001
[laughs]
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

37:16.034 --> 37:18.870
NOW, CLEM, MY DISCERNING
QUEER GUY EYE TELLS ME

37:18.904 --> 37:22.341
THAT YOU COULD USE
SOME DIVINE INTERVENTION.

37:22.374 --> 37:24.276
UNFORTUNATELY, SHE'S DEAD.

37:24.310 --> 37:25.877
BUT DON'T WORRY...
[grunts]

37:25.911 --> 37:28.914
THE QUEER GUY
CAN HELP, STARTING...

37:28.947 --> 37:30.516
WITH THE HAIR.

37:30.549 --> 37:31.917
A LITTLE PRODUCT.

37:31.950 --> 37:36.021
[humming]

37:36.054 --> 37:38.757
WORK IT IN, WORK IT IN.
WORK IT UP FROM THE ROOTS.

37:38.790 --> 37:41.026
UH, VERY COOL.

37:41.059 --> 37:43.962
NOW, WHAT'S WITH THE SHMATTE
YOU'RE WEARING?

37:43.995 --> 37:48.834
FORTUNATELY, I ALWAYS TRAVEL...
WITH A SPARE.

37:48.867 --> 37:50.035
THERE YOU GO.

37:50.068 --> 37:51.503
THAT'S A HELPFUL LITTLE TIP

37:51.537 --> 37:53.372
FOR ALL YOU HOT, SWEATY MEN.

37:53.405 --> 37:54.373
- [laughs]

37:54.406 --> 37:55.674
- NOT EVERYONE CAN CARRY OFF

37:55.707 --> 37:57.042
COTTON-CANDY PINK.

37:57.075 --> 37:58.076
YEAH. HUH.

37:58.109 --> 38:00.812
ONE MORE THING.

38:00.846 --> 38:03.649
THE GOOD LORD
GAVE US TWO EYEBROWS

38:03.682 --> 38:07.052
FOR A REASON: TO SEPARATE US
FROM THE APES.

38:07.085 --> 38:09.388
[razor whirs]

38:09.421 --> 38:11.523
ALL RIGHT.

38:11.557 --> 38:14.493
AND...

38:15.727 --> 38:18.530
[blows]
THERE!

38:18.564 --> 38:20.732
WELCOME TO CIVILIZATION.

38:20.766 --> 38:22.934
WOW, CLEM, WHO,
UH, KNEW YOU'D TURN OUT

38:22.968 --> 38:24.069
TO BE SUCH A HOTTIE?

38:24.102 --> 38:25.737
[chuckling]

38:25.771 --> 38:27.072
I'M EMMETT HONEYCUTT,

38:27.105 --> 38:29.541
AND THAT'S
YOUR QUEER GUY MINUTE.

38:29.575 --> 38:31.843
- AND WE'RE OUT.

38:31.877 --> 38:36.848
[applause]

38:41.853 --> 38:43.422
- HI, MOMMY.

38:43.455 --> 38:47.593
- HEY, LOOK WHO'S HERE!

38:47.626 --> 38:50.862
- OKAY, GUS, HOW ABOUT
WE GET A NICE APPLE?

38:53.164 --> 38:54.700
- MWAH.

38:54.733 --> 38:56.835
LOOK WHAT I MADE YOU.

38:56.868 --> 39:00.439
- HMM.
JUST WHAT HE NEEDS, SUGAR.

39:00.472 --> 39:03.775
- ONE'S NOT GOING
TO KILL HIM.

39:05.043 --> 39:06.445
- YOU CAN SCRAPE HIM

39:06.478 --> 39:07.979
OFF THE CEILING
AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING.

39:08.013 --> 39:09.715
- WHEN HE'S WITH YOU,
YOU FEED HIM WHAT YOU WANT.

39:09.748 --> 39:11.617
WHEN HE'S WITH ME,
I'LL FEED HIM WHAT I WANT.

39:11.650 --> 39:12.984
UNLESS YOU PLAN
TO TELL YOUR LAWYER

39:13.018 --> 39:14.586
I'M ABUSING HIM
BY FEEDING HIM A BROWNIE.

39:14.620 --> 39:16.388
- I WAS ONLY LOOKING AFTER
MY OWN INTERESTS.

39:16.422 --> 39:18.590
- YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.
- SAME AS YOU.

39:18.624 --> 39:19.758
- I TOLD YOU
I'D TAKE CARE OF IT,

39:19.791 --> 39:21.393
BUT THAT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

39:21.427 --> 39:22.994
SO YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED
BY DISCREDITING ME,

39:23.028 --> 39:25.130
BY MAKING IT SEEM
AS IF I WAS A LOUSY MOTHER.

39:25.163 --> 39:27.399
- I DIDN'T START
THIS CUSTODY BATTLE,

39:27.433 --> 39:28.867
BUT I'LL BE DAMNED IF I WAS
GOING TO LOSE JENNY REBECCA

39:28.900 --> 39:32.471
BECAUSE I DIDN'T STAND UP
FOR MYSELF.

39:32.504 --> 39:33.939
- SO WHEN DO YOU PLAN
TO TAKE OUR DAUGHTER?

39:33.972 --> 39:36.542
- THE LAWYERS
WILL SET UP A SCHEDULE.

39:36.575 --> 39:38.043
THEN WE CAN FIGHT OVER
WHO GETS TUESDAYS

39:38.076 --> 39:41.046
AND WHO GETS THURSDAYS.

39:43.449 --> 39:45.150
- YOU SURPRISED ME.

39:45.183 --> 39:48.654
I HAD NO IDEA
YOU WERE SUCH A KILLER.

39:48.687 --> 39:51.657
- I LEARNED FROM THE MASTER.

39:53.859 --> 39:55.827
[door slams]

39:59.531 --> 40:02.033
WELL, PETE, THAT'S IT.

40:02.067 --> 40:06.705
I JUST DELIVERED MY LAST
PINK PLATE SPECIAL.

40:06.738 --> 40:08.574
- WE'RE GOING TO MISS YOU, DEB.

40:08.607 --> 40:10.909
- NAH, I'LL WALK OUT
THE FRONT DOOR.

40:10.942 --> 40:13.044
THEY'LL BE SO BUSY CHOWING DOWN,
THEY WON'T EVEN NOTICE.

40:13.078 --> 40:15.046
- DEB!

40:15.080 --> 40:16.848
WE GOT A DISASTER
AT TABLE THREE.

40:16.882 --> 40:18.049
- LORETTA, HONEY,
I'M SURE WHATEVER IT IS,

40:18.083 --> 40:19.084
YOU CAN HANDLE IT.

40:19.117 --> 40:20.085
- NOTHING IN BOOT CAMP

40:20.118 --> 40:21.219
PREPARED ME FOR THIS.

40:21.252 --> 40:22.788
PLEASE!

40:22.821 --> 40:25.090
- ALL RIGHT, I'M COMING.

40:27.626 --> 40:30.061
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT'S SO
FUCKING IMPORTANT THAT YOU--

40:30.095 --> 40:32.731
all: * FOR SHE'S
A JOLLY GOOD HOMO *

40:32.764 --> 40:35.000
* FOR SHE'S
A JOLLY GOOD HOMO *

40:35.033 --> 40:39.738
* FOR SHE'S
A JOLLY GOOD HOMO *

40:39.771 --> 40:43.241
* WHICH NOBODY CAN DENY

40:43.274 --> 40:47.078
[cheers and applause]

40:47.112 --> 40:50.682
- TAKE IT OFF!

40:50.716 --> 40:52.584
[cheers and applause]

40:52.618 --> 40:55.587
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

40:55.621 --> 40:58.256
EXCEPT NOW I KNOW WHY WE
DON'T HAVE A GAY MEN'S CHORUS.

40:58.289 --> 41:00.959
[laughter]
- HEY!

41:00.992 --> 41:04.229
- BUT IT'S THE SENTIMENT
THAT COUNTS,

41:04.262 --> 41:07.699
AND IN THAT DEPARTMENT,
YOU ARE ALL-STARS.

41:07.733 --> 41:10.869
YOU WILL ALWAYS
BE IN MY HEART...

41:12.771 --> 41:16.542
JUST LIKE THIS PLACE,
ALWAYS.

41:18.877 --> 41:20.879
AND YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS HERE
WITH LORETTA.

41:20.912 --> 41:22.848
ALL RIGHT, SHE'S ACES.
DON'T GIVE HER ANY SHIT.

41:22.881 --> 41:27.586
SHE WAS TRAINED BY ME,
AND SHE CAN GIVE IT RIGHT BACK.

41:27.619 --> 41:29.020
REMEMBER TO ORDER A VEGETABLE
ONCE IN A WHILE.

41:29.054 --> 41:30.922
IT'S NOT GOING
TO KILL YOU.

41:30.956 --> 41:33.725
AND PUT A QUARTER OR A BILL
THERE IN THE JAR UP FRONT.

41:33.759 --> 41:35.527
IT'S FOR THE VIC GRASSI HOUSE,

41:35.561 --> 41:40.532
A CAUSE THAT IS NEAR
AND DEAR TO ME...

41:40.566 --> 41:42.868
LIKE ALL OF YOU.

41:42.901 --> 41:46.137
[applause]

41:46.171 --> 41:49.775
- WE LOVE YOU, DEB.

41:51.910 --> 41:54.512
- THANKS FOR EVERYTHING, DEB.

41:57.248 --> 41:59.551
THANK YOU.

41:59.585 --> 42:03.822
- YEAH, MOM,
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

42:03.855 --> 42:05.891
- WELL, I'M SURPRISED
TO SEE YOU HERE.

42:05.924 --> 42:08.660
- I'VE BEEN COMING HERE
ALL MY LIFE.

42:08.694 --> 42:10.028
I REMEMBER
SITTING IN THAT BOOTH,

42:10.061 --> 42:11.963
RIGHT OVER THERE,
EVERY DAY AFTER SCHOOL.

42:11.997 --> 42:13.832
IT WAS MY SEAT.

42:13.865 --> 42:17.035
AND YOU'D BRING ME--
- A BUTTER-CRUNCH SUNDAE.

42:17.068 --> 42:20.672
- WHILE I DID MY HOMEWORK.

42:20.706 --> 42:22.708
AND ALL THE KIDS
WERE SO JEALOUS.

42:22.741 --> 42:24.643
AND THEN WHEN MY BIRTHDAY
ROLLED AROUND,

42:24.676 --> 42:27.245
YOU'D COME TO CLASS
WITH CUPCAKES AND MILKSHAKES

42:27.278 --> 42:30.181
AND SERVE ALL THE KIDS
IN YOUR UNIFORM.

42:30.215 --> 42:33.919
AND SOME OF YOUR LITTLE
CLASSMATES EVEN GAVE ME TIPS.

42:33.952 --> 42:38.056
THEY ALL THOUGHT
I WAS PRETTY LUCKY.

42:38.089 --> 42:40.592
I WAS PRETTY LUCKY.

42:40.626 --> 42:43.094
- YOU DIDN'T FEEL THAT WAY
THE OTHER DAY.

42:43.128 --> 42:45.797
- I KNOW HOW HARD
IT WAS FOR YOU...

42:45.831 --> 42:48.700
RAISING ME ALONE.

42:50.101 --> 42:53.238
AND YOU DID MORE
THAN MAKE THE BEST OF IT.

42:53.271 --> 42:56.241
YOU WERE THE BEST.

43:10.722 --> 43:13.759
- YOU'RE SUCH A SILLY BOY.
- [chuckles]

43:13.792 --> 43:16.762
[dance music]

43:16.795 --> 43:21.266
*

43:21.299 --> 43:24.369
- TO BABYLON.

43:24.402 --> 43:27.372
STILL HERE AND STILL QUEER,

43:27.405 --> 43:30.108
EVEN THOUGH IT WOULD'VE MADE
A HELL OF A STARBUCKS.

43:30.141 --> 43:33.211
- I'LL HAVE
A TALL VODKA LATTE, PLEASE.

43:39.685 --> 43:40.786
- AHH.

43:40.819 --> 43:48.760
*

43:57.703 --> 44:00.305
OKAY, LET THEM IN.

44:00.338 --> 44:03.174
- THAT IS, IF THERE'S
ANYONE TO LET IN.

44:03.208 --> 44:09.080
[mixed chatter]

44:16.054 --> 44:17.222
HOLY SHIT!

44:17.255 --> 44:18.890
WOULD YOU LOOK HOW LONG
THAT LINE IS?

44:18.924 --> 44:20.759
- IT'S LONG BUT IS IT REAL?

44:20.792 --> 44:22.794
- AS THE IMMORTAL
JEFF STRYKER ONCE SAID,

44:22.828 --> 44:24.062
"YOU BET YOUR ASS IT IS."

44:24.095 --> 44:25.764
- CAN YOU BELIEVE
WE GOT IN?

44:25.797 --> 44:30.168
- WHO CARES IF IT'S
TWICE AS MUCH AS POPPERZ?

44:30.201 --> 44:32.437
- HEY, YOU GOT IN!
- IT WASN'T EASY.

44:32.470 --> 44:35.206
I HAD TO BRIBE THE DOORMAN
20 BUCKS.

44:35.240 --> 44:36.842
- OH, MY GOD,
IT'S THE QUEER GUY.

44:36.875 --> 44:40.245
I SAW YOU ON TV.
YOU'RE FABULOUS.

44:40.278 --> 44:43.481
- WELL, WHEN ONE
HAS THE EYE...

44:43.514 --> 44:45.851
- MAY I HAVE A DANCE
WITH THE QUEER GUY?

44:45.884 --> 44:48.353
- YOU COULD USE SOME TIPS
ON HOW TO SHAKE YOUR TUSH.

44:48.386 --> 44:50.722
- OKAY, YOU.
NOT YOU. NOT YOU.

44:50.756 --> 44:52.791
*

44:52.824 --> 44:54.125
- [laughs]

44:54.159 --> 44:55.927
WELL, I GUARANTEE
YOU'LL NEVER FIND

44:55.961 --> 44:59.230
ANYTHING LIKE THIS
AT POTTERY BARN.

44:59.264 --> 45:01.332
- UH-HUH.

45:01.366 --> 45:03.401
AND I'LL REFRAIN
FROM MENTIONING

45:03.434 --> 45:07.372
YOU WILL NOT SEE BANANAS
LIKE THIS AT BANANA REPUBLIC.

45:09.975 --> 45:12.811
- [sniffs]

45:12.844 --> 45:15.080
SO, YOU UP
FOR A LITTLE CELEBRATING?

45:15.113 --> 45:17.415
- [laughs]

45:17.448 --> 45:22.821
*

45:22.854 --> 45:26.524
- * YOU'VE GOTTA
LIVE OUT LOUD *

45:26.557 --> 45:30.361
* GOTTA LIVE OUT LOUD

45:30.395 --> 45:34.099

45:36.534 --> 45:40.105

45:40.138 --> 45:43.909
* LIFE AIN'T A GAME, OHH

45:43.942 --> 45:48.880
* LIFE AIN'T A GAME

45:48.914 --> 45:52.784

45:52.818 --> 45:56.387
