HERBS--

THE VIRUS HAS GOTTEN MUCH WORSE,

08:50.625 --> 08:52.959
AND HIS LUNG FUNCTION TESTS
SHOW A LARGE DECLINE.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.542
BUT YOU CAN GET HIM THROUGH
THIS, RIGHT, GET HIM BACK HOME?

08:55.583 --> 08:58.041
WELL, BEING ON A VENTILATOR
WILL HELP HEAL HIS LUNGS.

08:58.083 --> 09:00.041

WE CAN GET HIM HOME,

A LOT MORE ATTENTION--

OXYGEN SUPPLEMENTATION,
I.V. MEDS.

09:03.709 --> 09:06.667
WELL, I'LL SCALE BACK AT WORK.
I DON'T CARE.

09:06.709 --> 09:09.667
THE IDEA OF
LOSING HIM, TOO... HEY.

09:09.709 --> 09:11.250
(groans and gags)
HEY, HEY!

09:11.291 --> 09:13.166
HEY, WHOA! KIRK.

09:13.208 --> 09:15.625

I DON'T WANT THIS.

09:15.667 --> 09:18.000
I TOLD YOU ALREADY,
I CAN'T DO IT AGAIN.

09:18.041 --> 09:20.041
DON'T SAY THAT.

09:20.083 --> 09:22.041
JUST... PUT THIS BACK IN, NOW.

09:22.083 --> 09:25.041
NO, IT HURTS.
THIS IS THE FOURTH TIME, DAD.

09:25.083 --> 09:27.041
I CAN'T DO IT.

09:27.083 --> 09:29.583
I CAN'T TALK.
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

09:29.625 --> 09:33.041
KIRK, THE INTUBATION
IS ONLY TEMPORARY.
I'M GETTING WORSE.

09:33.083 --> 09:36.166
DAD, THE TRACHEOTOMY IS NEXT.
I CAN'T DO THAT.

09:36.208 --> 09:39.667
I WILL THROW EVERYTHING I HAVE
AT THIS. WE WILL FIND SOMETHING.

09:39.709 --> 09:42.208
THIS GIVES US TIME.
DO IT.

09:42.250 --> 09:44.041
DON'T!
ALL RIGHT.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.667
FINE, KIRK, ALL RIGHT?
NO TUBE, NOT RIGHT NOW.

09:46.709 --> 09:48.834
JUST... JUST BREATHE.

09:48.875 --> 09:50.208
(coughs)

09:50.250 --> 09:51.834
THERE WE GO.

09:51.875 --> 09:54.667
I DON'T WANT THIS LIFE.

09:54.709 --> 09:56.625
NOT THIS WAY.

09:56.667 --> 09:58.750
LET ME DIE.

10:10.709 --> 10:12.959
THANKS, DR. NAYAR.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.083
SPERM DONOR.

10:15.125 --> 10:17.125
SPERM DONOR.

10:17.166 --> 10:19.709
THE PARENTS USED
THE SAME SPERM DONOR.

10:19.750 --> 10:22.125
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES?
WELL, 25 YEARS AGO,

10:22.166 --> 10:24.750
THERE WERE ONLY A COUPLE OF
FERTILITY CLINICS IN THIS TOWN.

10:24.792 --> 10:27.041
SO EVERYBODY WHO WAS HAVING
TROUBLE GETTING PREGNANT

10:27.083 --> 10:29.041
WENT TO THE SAME DOCTOR?
AND THE DOCTORS USED

10:29.083 --> 10:31.583
THE SAME BATCH OF DONORS
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
YEAH, IT MAKES YOU
THINK TWICE

10:31.625 --> 10:33.959
ABOUT MESSING
WITH MOTHER NATURE, HUH?

10:34.000 --> 10:37.041
I DON'T MESS WITH
MOTHER NATURE. I USE SCIENCE--

10:37.083 --> 10:38.917
NO, I WASN'T SAY--I...

10:38.959 --> 10:41.000
I WAS JUST SAYING THAT--
RIGHT.

10:43.083 --> 10:45.041
SO HOW DO WE TELL THEM?

10:45.083 --> 10:48.041
HOW DO WE TELL A COUPLE
THAT'S MEANT TO BE TOGETHER

10:48.083 --> 10:50.542
THAT... THEY'RE NOT?

10:53.291 --> 10:55.291
WELL, EVERYTHING THEY KNOW
IS GONNA BE TAINTED--

10:55.333 --> 10:57.625
THEIR CHILDHOOD,
THEIR FAMILIES.

10:57.667 --> 11:00.709
WE HAVE TO LET THEM KNOW
THAT IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT.
WELL, IT ISN'T.

11:00.750 --> 11:03.625
I MEAN, THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT
THEY WERE BROTHER AND SISTER.

11:03.667 --> 11:06.041
AND NO ONE ELSE
NEEDS TO KNOW.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.917
WHO THEY TELL, WHAT THE SAY,
THAT'S THEIR CHOICE.

11:08.959 --> 11:11.542
SO NOT ONLY DO THEY
HAVE TO SPLIT UP,

11:11.583 --> 11:13.917
THEY HAVE TO LIE
TO EVERYONE THEY KNOW.

11:13.959 --> 11:15.625
WELL, INCEST IS A LOADED WORD.

11:15.667 --> 11:18.041
THE VISCERAL RESPONSE
IS REVULSION, OSTRACISM.

11:18.083 --> 11:20.709
THEY LOOK LIKE...
ANY OTHER YOUNG COUPLE
IN LOVE.

11:20.750 --> 11:23.875
AND WE GET TO BE THE ONES
TO BREAK THEIR HEARTS.

11:26.250 --> 11:28.250
YOU COACH
TWO LITTLE LEAGUE TEAMS.

11:28.291 --> 11:31.125
YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOU DON'T KNOW ONE SICK KID?

11:31.166 --> 11:33.041
NOT EVEN A COLD?

11:33.083 --> 11:35.208
OH, OKAY. GOTTA GO. BYE.

11:35.250 --> 11:37.834
OH, THAT'S YOUR PLAN TO GET
NEW BUSINESS, COLD-CALLING?

11:37.875 --> 11:39.667
(laughs) NO.

11:39.709 --> 11:42.041
NO.

11:42.083 --> 11:45.208
IT WORKED FOR PETE.
WANNA GET SOME LUNCH, TAKE
A BREAK FROM THE MADNESS?

11:45.250 --> 11:47.875
I CAN'T. I'M ALREADY BOOKED.
WITH?

11:47.917 --> 11:49.208
A FRIEND.

11:49.250 --> 11:53.667
I KNOW YOU'RE LYING TO ME.
YOU KNOW YOU'RE LYING TO ME.

11:53.709 --> 11:56.041
WE BOTH KNOW, AND YET LYING.

11:56.083 --> 11:57.667
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

12:09.875 --> 12:12.834
IT'S CRAZY,
BUT I FEEL LIGHTER ALREADY.

12:12.875 --> 12:14.792
WELL, THAT'S ONLY STEP ONE.

12:14.834 --> 12:16.792
TO REALLY SEE RESULTS,
YOU HAVE TO STICK

12:16.834 --> 12:19.792
TO THE EXERCISE AND DIET
WE DISCUSSED, AND THE HERBS.

12:19.834 --> 12:21.792
MAYBE I'LL JUST COME BACK
EVERY DAY.

12:21.834 --> 12:24.083
THAT SEEMS EASIER.

12:28.083 --> 12:30.583
DID YOU GET KIRK STABILIZED?

12:30.625 --> 12:32.500
UH, TEMPORARILY.

12:32.542 --> 12:35.041
WHEN HE CAME TO,
HE EXTUBATED HIMSELF.

12:35.083 --> 12:37.709
OHH.
I KNOW.
HE'S LETTING HIMSELF DIE.

12:37.750 --> 12:40.625
HE IS DYING. MAYBE IT'S TIME
TO START THINKING ABOUT HOSPICE

12:40.667 --> 12:42.750
INSTEAD OF HOSPITAL.
NO. CHARLIE WON'T DO THAT.

12:42.792 --> 12:45.041
COME ON, SAM. HOW OLD IS KIRK?

12:45.083 --> 12:48.625
HE WON'T BE 18
UNTIL NEXT MONTH.
(Cooper) WHO'S NOT 18,
THAT NEW RECEPTIONIST?

12:48.667 --> 12:50.750
NO, MY PATIENT.
AND BECAUSE THE POOR KID
CRASHES A FEW WEEKS SHY

12:50.792 --> 12:52.125
OF HIS 18th BIRTHDAY,

12:52.166 --> 12:54.667
YOU'RE GONNA FORCE HIM TO
INDULGE HIS FATHER'S GRIEF

12:54.709 --> 12:56.208
AND LIE IN BED
WITH AN INTUBATION TUBE

12:56.250 --> 12:58.500
JAMMED DOWN HIS THROAT?
UNTIL WHAT,

12:58.542 --> 13:00.959
THE ULCERS AND THE HEMORRHAGING
GET SO BAD, HE NEEDS A TRACH?

13:01.000 --> 13:03.041
NO 17-YEAR-OLD KID SHOULD BE
MAKING LIFE AND DEATH DECISIONS.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.500
HE'S BEEN FIGHTING THIS
SINE HE WAS 12. HE'S DONE.

13:05.542 --> 13:07.542
LOOK, CHARLIE'S WIFE DIED
TWO YEARS AGO.

13:07.583 --> 13:10.542
NOW YOU WANT ME TO FAULT HIM
FOR WANTING TO BUY HIS SON

13:10.583 --> 13:12.959
JUST... A LITTLE MORE TIME?

13:13.000 --> 13:16.709
TIME FOR KIRK TO LIVE...
OR FOR CHARLIE TO HOLD ON?

13:19.291 --> 13:21.959
WE'RE BROTHER AND SISTER?

13:23.333 --> 13:28.000
MY PARENTS NEVER EVEN TOLD ME
MY FATHER WASN'T MY FATHER.

13:28.041 --> 13:30.000
WELL, I'M SURE
THEY DIDN'T THINK

13:30.041 --> 13:32.041
IT WAS ANYTHING
THAT WOULD EVER BE RELEVANT.

13:32.083 --> 13:36.041
AND FOR ALL INTENTS
AND PURPOSES, IT WASN'T.

13:36.083 --> 13:39.542
THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.

13:39.583 --> 13:42.208
LOOK, THIS IS A LOT
TO ABSORB.

13:42.250 --> 13:45.125
WHY DON'T WE...
GIVE YOU A FEW MINUTES?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.834
DID YOU SEE
THE LOOK ON HER FACE?

13:58.875 --> 14:01.542
YOU WERE VERY GOOD
WITH THEM, THOUGH.

14:01.583 --> 14:03.625
SEE, NORMALLY
THIS WOULD BE THE PART

14:03.667 --> 14:05.625
WHERE I'D BE ASKING YOU
ABOUT KEVIN AGAIN,

14:05.667 --> 14:08.625
IF YOU THINK I SHOULD CALL HIM
EVEN THOUGH HE HASN'T CALLED ME.

14:08.667 --> 14:10.625
NORMALLY THAT'S WHAT
WE'D BE DOING RIGHT NOW

14:10.667 --> 14:12.625
IF YOU WERE TALKING
TO ME, NAI.
DON'T.

14:12.667 --> 14:15.667
NAI--
LOOK, I'M BEING AN ADULT
ABOUT THIS, ADDISON.

14:15.709 --> 14:17.250
IT DOES NOT MEAN
THAT I FORGIVE YOU.

14:17.291 --> 14:19.875
THANK YOU FOR TELLING US.

14:19.917 --> 14:22.041
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
THAT WE CAN DO...

14:22.083 --> 14:24.875
YOU CAN HELP US
GET PREGNANT.

14:24.917 --> 14:26.625
BUT WE JUST TOLD YOU THAT--

14:26.667 --> 14:29.041
WE HEARD WHAT YOU SAID,
BUT WE'RE SOUL MATES.

14:29.083 --> 14:31.041
WE LOVE EACH OTHER.

14:31.083 --> 14:34.166
WE'RE STAYING TOGETHER.

14:42.083 --> 14:44.458
COUSINS GET MARRIED
ALL THE TIME.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.750
THEY HAVE KIDS.
WHY CAN'T WE?

14:46.792 --> 14:50.083
BECAUSE YOUR CHILDREN WOULD HAVE
A 300 TIMES GREATER CHANCE OF

14:50.125 --> 14:53.041
DEVELOPING A GENETIC DISORDER,
WHICH COULD BE FATAL.

14:53.083 --> 14:55.041
WHAT ABOUT SPERM DONATION?

14:55.083 --> 14:58.291
FOR A COUPLE WHO, BY LAW,
SHOULDN'T BE MARRIED? I CAN'T.

14:58.333 --> 15:01.041
THEN WE'LL ADOPT.
(Addison) THE FIRST THING
AN ADOPTION AGENCY WILL LOOK AT

15:01.083 --> 15:03.583
IS YOUR MEDICAL HISTORY.

15:03.625 --> 15:06.333
THEY'LL SEE YOUR RELATIONSHIP
AND THEY WON'T--I--I'M SORRY.

15:06.375 --> 15:09.458
SO NO KIDS.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.500
HEY.

15:11.542 --> 15:14.041
WE JUST FORGET ABOUT KIDS.

15:14.083 --> 15:16.667
AS LONG
AS WE CAN BE TOGETHER--

15:16.709 --> 15:18.500
WITHOUT SEX?

15:18.542 --> 15:21.500
BECAUSE NO BIRTH CONTROL
IS 100%.

15:24.083 --> 15:26.959
THEN TIE MY TUBES.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.041
LISA, YOU'RE 23 YEARS OLD.
I...

15:30.083 --> 15:32.041
JUST TIE THEM

15:32.083 --> 15:35.000
SO I NEVER HAVE TO
THINK ABOUT THIS AGAIN.

15:38.333 --> 15:40.500
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO REMIND ME

15:40.542 --> 15:42.500
ABOUT THE, UH, THE HEALTH FAIR.

15:42.542 --> 15:45.291
OH! SORRY. WAIT.

15:45.333 --> 15:48.333
THE COMPANY THAT RENTS YOUR
ULTRASOUND MACHINES DID CALL.

15:48.375 --> 15:51.041
AND THEY'RE GONNA SEND A TRUCK
TO PICK THEM UP AROUND 1:00.

15:51.083 --> 15:53.667
PICK THEM UP?
DID THEY MENTION WHY?
YOU HAVEN'T PAID
IN THREE MONTHS.

15:53.709 --> 15:55.041
WHAT?
ARE YOU OKAY?

15:55.083 --> 15:57.667
(woman) HEY.
CAN YOU COVER
AT THE HEALTH FAIR PLEASE?

15:57.709 --> 15:59.667
UH, NO. UH, I'M WORKING
THROUGH LUNCH.

15:59.709 --> 16:02.000
CHECK THE BOARD.

16:02.041 --> 16:04.041
HA HA. COOPER, MY MAN.
HEALTH FAIR--

16:04.083 --> 16:07.041
GREAT WAY TO GET NEW PATIENTS.
I, UH, I HAVE LUNCH PLANS.

16:07.083 --> 16:09.917
LUNCH PLANS ARE MORE IMPORTANT
THAN THE PRACTICE? REALLY?

16:09.959 --> 16:13.000
WHAT WEB SITE
DID YOU FIND HER ON?
YEAH, COOPER, WHICH WEB SITE?

16:13.041 --> 16:16.667
I HAVE A LIMIT TO HOW FAR
YOU CAN PUSH, VIOLET.
ALL RIGHT, COOPER,

16:16.709 --> 16:19.500
GRAB A STETHOSCOPE,
GO GET SOME DAMN BALLOONS

16:19.542 --> 16:22.500
AND GO CHARM SOME MOTHERS
WHO DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER.

16:39.417 --> 16:43.375
I'M, UH,
HIDING MEDICAL EQUIPMENT.

16:43.417 --> 16:46.417
I'VE BEEN REDUCED TO...

16:46.458 --> 16:49.041
HIDING MEDICAL EQUIPMENT.

16:49.083 --> 16:51.417
WELL, I HAVE BEEN ASKED
TO TIE THE TUBES

16:51.458 --> 16:54.083
OF A PERFECTLY HEALTHY
YOUNG WOMAN

16:54.125 --> 16:56.792
SO THAT SHE CAN SLEEP
WITH HER BROTHER.

16:56.834 --> 16:59.083
INCEST TRUMPS
EQUIPMENT HIDING.

16:59.125 --> 17:02.875
OH... INCEST?
THAT'S--THAT'S NASTY.

17:02.917 --> 17:05.041
SO WHAT DOES NAOMI SAY?

17:05.083 --> 17:09.375
THAT IS
A VERY GOOD QUESTION, SAM.

17:09.417 --> 17:11.875
WHAT DOES NAOMI SAY?

17:11.917 --> 17:13.875
AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE

17:13.917 --> 17:19.875
BECAUSE SHE IS PROFESSIONAL
AND COURTEOUS, AND SHE HATES ME.

17:19.917 --> 17:22.792
AND I CAN'T EVEN TALK TO HER
ABOUT THE FACT THAT SHE HATES ME

17:22.834 --> 17:25.417
OR ABOUT THE PRACTICE
OR KEVIN--
OR--OR KEVIN?

17:25.458 --> 17:27.458
MY COP.
NO, S.W.A.T., ACTUALLY.

17:27.500 --> 17:30.458
UM, WE HAD A DATE.
IT WAS A GOOD DATE, YOU KNOW?

17:30.500 --> 17:33.458
AND HE HASN'T CALLED
AND... YOU'RE A MAN.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.500
WHY DO YOU GUYS DO THAT?

17:35.542 --> 17:37.500
UH, WELL, DID YOU--
DID YOU TRY CALLING HIM?

17:37.542 --> 17:39.792
NO. WHY SHOULD I? HE KNOWS
I WANT TO TALK TO HIM.

17:39.834 --> 17:44.291
WELL, HE WOULD IF YOU--
YOU CALLED HIM.
MM.

17:44.333 --> 17:46.500
YOU SUCK AT BEING NAOMI.

17:46.542 --> 17:48.583
YEAH, GOT THAT RIGHT.

17:48.625 --> 17:51.000
(elevator bell dings)

17:56.083 --> 17:59.792
(lowered voice) WHAT KIND OF
A DEFECT DO YOU HAVE?
(whispering) I'M SORRY.

17:59.834 --> 18:02.792
I GET ONE HOUR FOR LUNCH.
I WAS HALFWAY ACROSS TOWN.

18:02.834 --> 18:06.417
I ORDERED WINE, I FOUND A QUIET
CORNER BOOTH, WHICH WAS GOOD,

18:06.458 --> 18:09.041
BECAUSE OTHERWISE,
I MIGHT HAVE MISSED YOUR TEXT.
I SHOULD HAVE CALLED.

18:09.083 --> 18:12.041
NO. YOU NEVER SHOULD HAVE
INVITED ME TO A LUNCH

18:12.083 --> 18:14.041
YOU DIDN'T PLAN ON ATTENDING.

18:14.083 --> 18:16.041
I'M NOT LOOKING
FOR A RELATIONSHIP OR LOVE

18:16.083 --> 18:17.625
OR ANY OF THAT GARBAGE,

18:17.667 --> 18:20.333
BUT I WON'T BE TREATED
LIKE I DON'T MATTER.

18:23.083 --> 18:25.500
(elevator bell dings)

18:28.500 --> 18:31.875
UGH. PLEASE TELL ME YOU DIDN'T
JUST PISS OFF CHARLOTTE KING.
(telephone rings)

18:31.917 --> 18:32.875
OCEANSIDE WELLNESS GROUP.
OF COURSE NOT.

18:32.917 --> 18:34.458
WHAT WAS SHE DOING HERE?

18:34.500 --> 18:37.458
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I TOLD HER I
COULDN'T TALK 'CAUSE WE'RE BUSY.

18:37.500 --> 18:40.417
SAM, YOU HAVE A CALL.
JUST TAKE A MESSAGE, PLEASE.

18:40.458 --> 18:43.333
OH, YEAH.
UM, CAN I TAKE A MESSAGE?

18:43.375 --> 18:46.000
WHICH COLLECTION AGENCY
WAS IT THIS TIME?

18:46.041 --> 18:49.041
IT WAS THE HOSPITAL.
THE HOSPITAL?

18:49.083 --> 18:53.083
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU--
I'M STANDING... WHAT WAS IT?

18:53.125 --> 18:56.333
SOME GUY--CHARLIE JENSEN?
HE WANTED YOU TO MEET HIM THERE.

18:58.083 --> 19:01.125
YOU GOTTA PUT
THE TUBE BACK IN.

19:01.166 --> 19:04.500
KIRK'S RIGHT.
HE'S NOT GETTING ANY BETTER.

19:04.542 --> 19:07.500
KIRK'S TIRED OF BEING SICK.
YOU THINK I DON'T GET THAT?

19:07.542 --> 19:10.041
BUT HE DOESN'T SEE THIS
FROM EVERY ANGLE LIKE I DO.

19:10.083 --> 19:12.458
I KNOW HOW TO APPROACH
A PROBLEM.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.500
I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH MONEY

19:14.542 --> 19:17.041
OR TIME WE HAVE TO
PUT INTO THIS.

19:17.083 --> 19:19.041
WE'RE GONNA FIGHT THIS.
HE'S A TEENAGER, SAM.

19:19.083 --> 19:22.375
HE'S A TEENAGER WHOSE LIFE
ISN'T OVER YET.

19:22.417 --> 19:24.792
HE'S A MONTH AWAY
FROM BEING 18.

19:27.542 --> 19:29.500
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY DOCTOR
IN TOWN, SAM.

19:29.542 --> 19:31.750
I COULD TAKE MY SON
AND MY BUSINESS.

19:31.792 --> 19:35.417
YOU CHASED ME HARD
FOR THOSE EXECUTIVE PHYSICALS.
ARE YOU THREATENING ME?

19:35.458 --> 19:38.417
YOU HAVE A LOT OF EXPENSES, SAM.
YOU REALLY WANNA LET

19:38.458 --> 19:40.959
A HUGE CHUNK OF BUSINESS
WALK OUT THE DOOR?
(sighs)

19:41.000 --> 19:43.041
IF THERE WAS SOMEONE YOU LOVED,

19:43.083 --> 19:45.709
WOULDN'T YOU DO
EVERYTHING TO SAVE THEM?
HIS SATs ARE DROPPING.
THEY'RE DANGEROUSLY LOW.

19:45.750 --> 19:49.458
YOU GOTTA PUT
THE TUBE BACK IN.
HE'S JUST GONNA PULL IT
BACK OUT AGAIN.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.458
THEN RESTRAIN HIM.

19:51.500 --> 19:52.792
ALL RIGHT,

19:52.834 --> 19:56.333
GIVE HIM 20 MILLIGRAMS
OF ETOMIDATE AND 100 OF SUX.

19:56.375 --> 19:59.375
KIRK, WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU
A LITTLE SOMETHING TO RELAX YOU,

19:59.417 --> 20:02.041
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
INTUBATE YOU AGAIN.
I DON'T--I DON'T WANT--

20:02.083 --> 20:04.041
ALL RIGHT, RELAX.
NO, I DON'T WANT IT. NO.

20:04.083 --> 20:05.875
HEY, EASY.
GIVE ME THOSE RESTRAINTS.

20:05.917 --> 20:08.417
I'M SORRY,
BUT I HAVE TO DO THIS.
DO YOU?

20:08.458 --> 20:10.875
ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA NEED
AN 8-0, AN E.T. TUBE

20:10.917 --> 20:13.834
AND A MAC BLADE, PLEASE.
(whimpers)

20:16.792 --> 20:18.542
(machine whirring)

20:18.583 --> 20:21.458
(panting)

20:21.500 --> 20:24.041
(whirring continues)

20:29.083 --> 20:30.458
DR. MONTGOMERY.

20:30.500 --> 20:34.041
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ALONE,
WITHOUT BRIAN.

20:34.083 --> 20:37.625
LISA... IF YOU GET
YOUR TUBES TIED...

20:37.667 --> 20:39.458
YOU WANTED A CHILD.

20:39.500 --> 20:43.667
NO, DON'T.
PLEASE JUST HEAR ME OUT.

20:43.709 --> 20:45.667
I KNOW WHAT YOU SAY WE ARE,

20:45.709 --> 20:48.041
AND I KNOW THAT...

20:48.083 --> 20:51.291
THIS IS DISGUSTING TO YOU--
IT'S NOT--

20:51.333 --> 20:53.291
HE'S ALL I HAVE.

20:53.333 --> 20:55.917
BRIAN--
HE'S ALL I'VE EVER HAD.

20:58.083 --> 21:01.750
I WAS SHY... BEFORE HIM.

21:01.792 --> 21:06.041
I WAS SHY
AND... BRIAN SEES ME.

21:06.083 --> 21:10.458
HE SEES ME AND HE KNOWS ME
AND HE LOVES ME.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.458
MY WHOLE LIFE, I FELT LIKE

21:12.500 --> 21:14.458
THERE WAS
THIS MISSING PIECE OF ME,

21:14.500 --> 21:17.041
LIKE I DIDN'T FIT,

21:17.083 --> 21:19.041
AND BRIAN...

21:19.083 --> 21:21.542
HE'S MY MISSING PIECE,

21:21.583 --> 21:24.417
SO BEFORE YOU SAY NO
TO THE SURGERY,

21:24.458 --> 21:27.041
CONSIDER...

21:27.083 --> 21:31.375
JUST CONSIDER
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING OF ME.

21:31.417 --> 21:34.750
YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO MAKE MYSELF LESS WHOLE,

21:34.792 --> 21:37.542
TO LOSE A PART OF ME.

21:37.583 --> 21:39.959
HE'S... MY MISSING PIECE.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
MY BEST FRIEND
IS MY MISSING PIECE.

21:46.834 --> 21:50.041
HEY, SAM. YOU MAKE
A DECISION ABOUT KIRK?

21:50.083 --> 21:51.875
YEAH, I REINTUBATED HIM.

21:51.917 --> 21:56.000
AGAINST HIS WISHES.
AGAINST HIS EXPRESSED WI--

21:56.041 --> 21:58.000
I DID WHAT HIS FATHER--
HIS LEGAL GUARDIAN--WANTED.

21:58.041 --> 22:00.041
NOW KIRK'S UNDERAGE.
I HAD NO CHOICE.

22:00.083 --> 22:02.625
YES, YOU DID. YOU CHOSE TO
IGNORE YOUR PATIENT'S WISHES

22:02.667 --> 22:05.917
TO KEEP HIS FATHER HAPPY BECAUSE
KEEPING CHARLIE JENSEN HAPPY

22:05.959 --> 22:08.041
IS GOOD FOR BUSINESS.
PETE, YOU'RE NOT BEING FAIR.

22:08.083 --> 22:10.709
HOW MUCH ARE WE TAKING IN
ON THESE PHYSICALS, SAM?

22:10.750 --> 22:13.041
ENOUGH TO PUT HIS KID
THROUGH HELL?
I MADE MY DECISION.

22:13.083 --> 22:15.709
YOU MADE THE WRONG ONE.

22:15.750 --> 22:19.500
HEY... I'M IN CHARGE HERE.
OKAY? ME. I AM IN CHARGE.

22:19.542 --> 22:21.834
SO WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK

22:21.875 --> 22:25.417
TO SUCKING THE FAT OUT
OF PEOPLE AND MAKING US MONEY,

22:25.458 --> 22:28.333
AND LET ME DO WHAT I NEED TO DO
TO SAVE THIS PLACE?
IT'S A CELLULITE
REDUCTION SYSTEM.

22:28.375 --> 22:29.709
PETE, PETE--
NO, DON'T.

22:29.750 --> 22:31.709
WHAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT
QUESTION, SAM,

22:31.750 --> 22:33.417
WHAT'S BEST FOR THE PRACTICE

22:33.458 --> 22:36.792
OR WHAT'S BEST
FOR THE PATIENT?

22:36.834 --> 22:39.792
I WISH I HAD WHAT THEY HAVE.
YOU--YOU WANT TO SLEEP
WITH YOUR BROTHER?

22:39.834 --> 22:41.792
NO, THAT KIND OF DEVOTION.

22:41.834 --> 22:44.625
THEY'RE A TEAM, BEST FRIENDS,
JOINED AT THE HIP.

22:44.667 --> 22:47.041
THEY DESERVE TO BE HAPPY.
THEY ARE A BROTHER
AND SISTER

22:47.083 --> 22:50.041
WHO WANT TO HAVE SEX
WITH EACH OTHER.
OH, COME ON.

22:50.083 --> 22:52.041
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY WERE RAISED
AS BROTHER AND SISTER.

22:52.083 --> 22:54.041
YOU'RE ACTUALLY
CONSIDERING THIS?

22:54.083 --> 22:56.041
THE CLIENT WANTS
WHAT THEY WANT.

22:56.083 --> 22:58.041
AND SO YOU'RE GONNA
STERILIZE THEM

22:58.083 --> 23:01.041
SO THEY CAN STAY INCESTUOUS?
WELL, STEPCHILDREN
WHO GROW UP TOGETHER

23:01.083 --> 23:02.625
END UP MARRYING.

23:02.667 --> 23:05.375
I-I THINK THAT'S WORSE. THEY'RE
RAISED AS BROTHER AND SISTER.

23:05.417 --> 23:06.875
YEAH, WELL,
YOU'RE A SHRINK,

23:06.917 --> 23:10.000
AND YOU BELIEVE THAT NURTURE
IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN NATURE,

23:10.041 --> 23:12.709
BUT, BUT BIOLOGY SAYS
THIS IS WRONG.

23:12.750 --> 23:14.500
IS IT REALLY OURS
TO DECIDE?

23:14.542 --> 23:17.667
I MEAN, THESE PEOPLE
ARE EVERYTHING TO EACH OTHER.

23:17.709 --> 23:20.041
I'VE NEVER SEEN A COUPLE
SO CLOSE.
BECAUSE THEY FOUND LOVE,

23:20.083 --> 23:23.291
OR BECAUSE THEY'RE
GENETICALLY SIMILAR?
(door opens)

23:23.333 --> 23:27.375
UM, I JUST HEARD. HOW DID
HANSEL AND GRETEL TAKE THE NEWS?

23:27.417 --> 23:29.667
GRETEL WANTS
HER TUBES TIED.

23:29.709 --> 23:33.041
YOU GUYS ARE ACTUALLY
CONSIDERING THIS?
UH, "THEY" GUYS,
NOT "ME" GUY.

23:33.083 --> 23:36.041
YOU WANT TO SPONSOR INBREEDING?
THAT IS GROSS,

23:36.083 --> 23:38.041
AND, YOU KNOW, I KNOW GROSS.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.709
IT'S NOT INBREEDING IF WE DO
A TUBAL LIGATION.
INTERESTING POINT,

23:40.750 --> 23:42.750
BUT AS THE AMERICAN MEDICAL
ASSOCIATION GUIDELINE

23:42.792 --> 23:44.500
POINTS OUT... (retches)

23:44.542 --> 23:47.500
STOP IT! THEY PROBABLY
TELL EACH OTHER EVERYTHING.

23:47.542 --> 23:49.750
THEY DON'T LIE TO EACH OTHER.

23:49.792 --> 23:52.041
SOUNDS NICE.

23:52.083 --> 23:54.041
OH, DO I GET A DOT
FOR THE CONSULT?
GET OUT.

23:54.083 --> 23:56.041
LISTEN,

23:56.083 --> 23:57.834
YOU--YOU CANNOT
CONSIDER THIS.

23:57.875 --> 24:00.500
KIDS ARE THE ONE THING
THAT THEY BOTH WANTED.

24:00.542 --> 24:02.417
THAT AND EACH OTHER.
(door opens)

24:02.458 --> 24:06.792
CONFERENCE ROOM, 12:00.
AY, MIS OJOS.

24:11.458 --> 24:13.417
I DON'T THINK THIS IS
HOW HANSEL AND GRETEL

24:13.458 --> 24:16.041
IS SUPPOSED TO END.
(sighs)

24:16.083 --> 24:18.041
(children laughing)
(Cooper) NO, NO, NO!
WRONG WAY.

24:18.083 --> 24:20.041
WHOA! OH, OH.
WATCH OUT FOR THE DOCTOR.

24:20.083 --> 24:22.458
OH, UH, RIGHT.
UH, SCRUB HARD.

24:22.500 --> 24:24.542
I'LL TALK TO YOU SOON.
(laughing continues)

24:24.583 --> 24:27.041
LICE.
NO, DOESN'T COUNT.

24:27.083 --> 24:29.500
COOPER, YOU HAD THOSE KIDS
SINCE THEY WERE BABIES.

24:29.542 --> 24:31.917
WE NEED NEW BUSINESS.

24:36.083 --> 24:38.667
DON'T SAY IT.

24:38.709 --> 24:41.542
SAY WHAT?
THAT, UH, WHAT, I'VE BEEN
CHASING CASES,

24:41.583 --> 24:43.542
THAT I'M RUNNING THIS PLACE
LIKE A FACTORY,

24:43.583 --> 24:45.458
'CAUSE, ALL RIGHT, I'VE BEEN
DOING THE BEST I CAN.

24:45.500 --> 24:48.834
AND SOMEBODY
HAD TO DO SOMETHING.
I WAS GOING TO FIX THIS.

24:48.875 --> 24:51.500
I JUST NEEDED TIME.
I NEEDED A LITTLE FAITH.

24:51.542 --> 24:54.500
WHAT, WHOA, WHOA. WHAT ABOUT
A LITTLE FAITH IN US, HUH,

24:54.542 --> 24:56.417
AND TELLING US THE TRUTH?

24:56.458 --> 24:58.834
ADDISON AND I--
YOU KNOW, WHEN--WHEN DID THIS
BECOME ABOUT YOU AND ADDISON?

24:58.875 --> 25:00.709
WHEN YOU STARTED
KEEPING THINGS FROM US.

25:00.750 --> 25:03.041
YOU KNOW, ADDISON DIDN'T START
THIS PRACTICE WITH YOU

25:03.083 --> 25:04.625
FROM NOTHING.

25:04.667 --> 25:06.625
SHE DIDN'T WORK SATURDAYS
TO PAY THE BILLS

25:06.667 --> 25:08.917
WHILE YOU WROTE YOUR BOOK.

25:08.959 --> 25:11.500
SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO PLAY
TRAFFIC COP AND DEN MOTHER

25:11.542 --> 25:15.041
WHILE ALL OF YOU GOT TO PLAY
IDEALISTIC DOCTOR.
I'M JUST TRYING TO SAVE
WHAT WE STARTED.

25:15.083 --> 25:17.500
WELL, IF WE KEEP DOING THINGS
YOUR WAY, SAM,

25:17.542 --> 25:19.417
IS IT WORTH SAVING?

25:25.417 --> 25:26.750
COME ON, CHARLOTTE.

25:26.792 --> 25:28.750
CALL ME BACK
OR LEAVE ME A MESSAGE

25:28.792 --> 25:31.792
OR SEND ME AN OBNOXIOUS TEXT.
WE'LL, UH...

25:37.083 --> 25:38.458
SORRY, YEAH.

25:38.500 --> 25:40.333
UH, LEAVE ME A MESSAGE.

25:40.375 --> 25:43.333
ACTUALLY, THE TREATMENT IS
PERFORMED ON THE WHOLE BODY,

25:43.375 --> 25:44.792
ADAPTED FOR
THE SKIN SENSITIVITY

25:44.834 --> 25:47.583
OF EACH INDIVIDUAL, SO--
(scoffs)
THIS PLACE IS BAD ENOUGH

25:47.625 --> 25:50.041
WITHOUT YOU TRYING TO SELL
YOUR MAGIC BEANS TO EVERYONE.

25:50.083 --> 25:52.834
I MEAN, DOES SHE REALLY LOOK
LIKE SHE NEEDS HELP?

25:52.875 --> 25:54.417
DOES THAT BODY NEED...

25:54.458 --> 25:55.917
ANYTHING?

25:55.959 --> 25:58.709
I MEAN, DOES ANY BODY
REALLY NEED ITS FAT PULVERIZED

25:58.750 --> 26:00.375
INTO SUBMISSION?

26:00.417 --> 26:02.291
VIOLET, VIOLET,
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE?

26:02.333 --> 26:05.834
YOU ARE A... A-A-A JUDGER.

26:05.875 --> 26:09.041
YOU'RE A JUDGY JUDGER
WHO HAS NO RIGHT TO JUDGE

26:09.083 --> 26:13.041
UNTIL SHE TRIES IT
FOR HERSELF.

26:13.083 --> 26:15.667
SHE--SHE CAN'T BE.
WELL, SHE IS.

26:15.709 --> 26:18.041
(sighs) VIOLET.
YOU REALLY THINK IT'S HER?

26:18.083 --> 26:21.041
OH, IT'S HER.
YOU REALLY THINK IT WORKS?

26:21.083 --> 26:22.959
YOU OKAY?
YEAH. HERE, SWITCH.

26:26.417 --> 26:29.417
WHY WOULD SHE STOOP TO THIS?
SHE HATES THAT THING?

26:29.458 --> 26:31.667
I DON'T KNOW W--OH,
AND RIGHT THERE, PLEASE.

26:31.709 --> 26:33.041
MM-HMM.

26:33.083 --> 26:34.041
MM.

26:34.083 --> 26:36.041
AND AGAIN.

26:36.083 --> 26:37.792
IS VIOLET DEFATALATING?

26:39.500 --> 26:40.875
SORRY?
HUH?

26:40.917 --> 26:43.291
SHE BETTER BE PAYING.

26:50.667 --> 26:52.041
MAYBE I WAS TOO JUDGMENTAL.

26:52.083 --> 26:53.667
SEE?

26:53.709 --> 26:56.041
MAYBE I'M WRONG
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

26:56.083 --> 26:58.041
YOU'RE BRINGING IN
NEW CLIENTS,

26:58.083 --> 26:59.458
SAM HAS HIS PHYSICALS,

26:59.500 --> 27:01.583
EVEN COOPER GOT
SOME NEW BUSINESS

27:01.625 --> 27:04.041
AT THAT STUPID HEALTH FAIR.

27:04.083 --> 27:05.709
AND I...

27:05.750 --> 27:08.917
I ACTUALLY THINK
I'M GETTING THINNER. (laughs)

27:08.959 --> 27:11.583
VIOLET. (sighs)

27:11.625 --> 27:13.667
YOU DON'T LOSE WEIGHT JUST...

27:13.709 --> 27:17.000
BY W-WAVING THE WAND.

27:17.041 --> 27:19.500
EVERYONE WHO COMES THROUGH
THAT DOOR,

27:19.542 --> 27:22.458
THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT A HEALTHY LIFE PLAN.

27:22.500 --> 27:24.875
ALL THEY WANT IS MAGIC.

27:24.917 --> 27:27.667
THIS ISN'T MAGIC.
THIS IS A...

27:27.709 --> 27:29.709
THIS IS CRAP.

27:31.500 --> 27:34.000
I--HEY.

27:34.041 --> 27:36.375
HEY, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

27:36.417 --> 27:38.375
YOU DON'T NEED
TO LOSE WEIGHT.

27:38.417 --> 27:40.959
YOUR...
YOUR ASS LOOKS FANTASTIC.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.041
(crying) I KNOW MY ASS
LOOKS FANTASTIC.

27:44.083 --> 27:47.375
BUT THANK YOU... FOR SAYING IT,
NOT FOR THINKING

27:47.417 --> 27:50.375
THAT I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
SELF-ESTEEM TO LOVE MY OWN ASS.

27:50.417 --> 27:52.000
I LOVE MY ASS.

27:52.041 --> 27:53.417
IT IS ROUND AND FIRM

27:53.458 --> 27:56.041
AND, LIKE, LIKE, TEN YEARS
YOUNGER THAN THE REST OF ME.

27:56.083 --> 27:57.583
IT'S A FANTASTIC ASS.

27:57.625 --> 28:00.625
MEN CANNOT KEEP THEIR HANDS
OFF MY ASS.

28:02.750 --> 28:05.333
(sniffles)
STOP TOUCHING MY ASS!

28:05.375 --> 28:07.333
(normal voice) OH...

28:07.375 --> 28:09.792
DAMN IT.

28:09.834 --> 28:12.750
THE PRACTICE IS GOING TO HELL,
AND COOPER IS LYING TO ME,

28:12.792 --> 28:14.750
AND I AM SITTING HERE
ENCOURAGING YOU

28:14.792 --> 28:17.542
TO RUB FAT OFF MY ASS.

28:17.583 --> 28:20.041
LIFE IS NOT ASS FAT,
AND IF IT IS,

28:20.083 --> 28:23.500
IT'S NOT ASS FAT THAT CAN
MAGICALLY DISAPPEAR WITH A WAND.

28:25.500 --> 28:28.041
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

28:28.083 --> 28:29.667
(Naomi) THEY'RE HERE.

28:29.709 --> 28:31.667
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA TELL 'EM?

28:31.709 --> 28:33.667
(sighs) IF I TELL THEM NO,

28:33.709 --> 28:35.667
THEY'RE JUST GONNA GO
TO SOMEONE ELSE.

28:35.709 --> 28:38.667
WELL, I GUESS YOU'LL DO
WHAT YOU FEEL IS BEST.

28:38.709 --> 28:41.709
OKAY, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO SAY TO YOU, THAT I AM SORRY?

28:41.750 --> 28:43.834
BECAUSE I'M NOT. I WAS
TRYING TO SAVE THE PRACTICE.

28:43.875 --> 28:46.417
I WAS TRYING TO HELP YOU.
OH, WOW. WELL, THANKS
FOR HELPING ME.

28:46.458 --> 28:48.417
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS MY PRACTICE, TOO.

28:48.458 --> 28:50.917
I GAVE UP A HELL OF A LOT
TO COME DOWN HERE.

28:50.959 --> 28:53.041
AND I CAME DOWN HERE FOR YOU,
FOR YOU AND SAM.

28:53.083 --> 28:56.041
YOU WENT BEHIND MY BACK
AND YOU HURT ME,

28:56.083 --> 28:57.709
AND IT CAN'T BE UNDONE.

28:57.750 --> 29:00.000
SOME THINGS
JUST CAN'T BE UNDONE.

29:02.417 --> 29:05.041
WELL, WILL YOU TIE MY TUBES?

29:05.083 --> 29:08.041
BECAUSE IF SO, WE THOUGHT
MAYBE YOU COULD DO IT TODAY.

29:08.083 --> 29:09.417
WE CAN'T--

29:09.458 --> 29:11.458
WE CAN'T TAKE ANOTHER DAY
OF THIS, ANOTHER NIGHT.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.417
WE DIDN'T SLEEP.

29:13.458 --> 29:16.500
WE JUST WANT EVERYTHING
BACK THE WAY IT WAS.
SO WILL YOU?

29:16.542 --> 29:18.500
WILL YOU?

29:18.542 --> 29:21.333
YOU'RE BROTHER AND SISTER.

29:21.375 --> 29:23.709
NOW HOW CAN YOU GO BACK
TO THE WAY THINGS WERE

29:23.750 --> 29:26.458
WHEN YOU KNOW
YOU'RE BROTHER AND SISTER?

29:26.500 --> 29:27.750
KNOWING
DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING.

29:27.792 --> 29:30.333
IT DOESN'T CHANGE
HOW WE FEEL ABOUT ONE ANOTHER.

29:30.375 --> 29:33.291
IT CHANGES EVERYTHING,
AND IT CAN'T BE UNDONE.
BECAUSE WE KNOW?

29:33.333 --> 29:35.750
YOU'RE WRONG.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

29:35.792 --> 29:38.041
YOU THINK IF WE'D KNOWN
BEFORE WE GOT MARRIED,

29:38.083 --> 29:40.041
WE WOULDN'T HAVE?
WELL, WE WOULD.

29:40.083 --> 29:42.417
I-I DON'T THINK SO.

29:42.458 --> 29:44.333
IT DIDN'T MATTER TO ME
WHEN I FOUND OUT.

29:44.375 --> 29:46.041
I STILL MARRIED HER.

29:46.083 --> 29:47.834
♪♪

29:47.875 --> 29:49.750
YOU STILL MARRIED ME?

29:49.792 --> 29:51.709
