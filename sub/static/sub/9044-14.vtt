WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:03.333
- HEY, GOOD MORNIN'.
- HEY.

00:03.333 --> 00:05.200
WHEN DID YOU
FINALLY COME TO BED?

00:05.200 --> 00:06.933
'CAUSE I THOUGHT
YOU WERE COMING RIGHT UP,

00:06.933 --> 00:08.433
BUT THEN I FELL ASLEEP.

00:08.433 --> 00:10.300
- YEAH, THE GAME,
IT WENT INTO DOUBLE OVERTIME.

00:10.300 --> 00:12.167
IT WAS AMAZING.
- OH...

00:12.167 --> 00:15.233
'CAUSE I THOUGHT
WE HAD PLANS.

00:17.667 --> 00:20.233
- SORRY. GOD...

00:20.233 --> 00:21.733
- DID YOU CATCH
THE END OF THAT GAME?

00:21.733 --> 00:22.833
- OH, IT WAS AMAZING.

00:22.833 --> 00:24.400
- SEE?
- ALL RIGHT.

00:24.400 --> 00:27.233
WELL, I'LL LET YOU BOYS
TALK ABOUT YOUR EXCITING SPORTS.

00:27.233 --> 00:30.333
I JUST HOPE THERE'S
NOT A GAME ON TONIGHT.

00:34.267 --> 00:37.100
- HUH.
- WHAT?

00:37.100 --> 00:40.800
- I THINK SHE JUST
GAVE ME THE LOOK.

00:40.800 --> 00:42.167
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:42.167 --> 00:46.000
- YOU KNOW...

00:48.633 --> 00:51.233
SEX.

00:51.233 --> 00:54.267
- THAT FACE MEANS "SEX"?

00:56.100 --> 00:59.033
I THOUGHT IT MEANT "GAS."

00:59.033 --> 01:01.167
- SHE DOES IT BETTER, OKAY?

01:01.167 --> 01:02.833
- YEAH, I KNOW
WHEN AMY'S IN THE MOOD,

01:02.833 --> 01:06.333
'CAUSE SHE ALWAYS GIVES ME
THIS SEXY LITTLE SIDEWAYS SMILE.

01:08.133 --> 01:10.400
- YEAH, YEAH.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.667
- I THINK AMY'S SAYING,

01:11.667 --> 01:14.700
"HURRY UP
AND GET IT OVER WITH."

01:18.333 --> 01:21.200
- YOUR MOTHER'S
GOT A LOOK, TOO,

01:21.200 --> 01:26.267
WHICH IS WHY AFTER SUNSET,
I AVOID ALL EYE CONTACT.

01:30.133 --> 01:32.400
- IT'S WEIRD, THOUGH.
IT'S WEIRD.

01:32.400 --> 01:35.500
OKAY, LAST NIGHT,
I GOT THE LOOK.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.500
BUT I GOT CAUGHT UP
IN THE GAME,

01:37.500 --> 01:39.900
SO I STAYED UP TO WATCH IT
INSTEAD OF GOING UPSTAIRS.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.967
AND NOW,
INSTEAD OF BEING MAD,

01:41.967 --> 01:44.333
DEBRA GAVE ME
THE LOOK AGAIN.

01:44.333 --> 01:45.633
HUH.

01:45.633 --> 01:48.200
- MAYBE--MAYBE I SHOULD

01:48.200 --> 01:51.800
TURN HER DOWN AGAIN,
YOU KNOW?

01:51.800 --> 01:54.567
- WHY WOULD YOU DO
A SILLY THING LIKE THAT?

01:54.567 --> 01:55.767
- I DON'T KNOW.

01:55.767 --> 01:57.733
I MEAN, I'M ALWAYS
THE ONE BEING SHOT DOWN.

01:57.733 --> 02:00.967
IT FELT GOOD, HER WONDERING
WHERE I WAS LAST NIGHT.

02:00.967 --> 02:02.933
- YOU CAN'T TURN HER DOWN.

02:02.933 --> 02:05.067
- I-I COULD TOO
TURN HER DOWN.

02:05.067 --> 02:06.300
- OH, COME ON,
YOU FOLLOW HER AROUND

02:06.300 --> 02:09.367
LIKE A DOG WITH
HIS TONGUE HANGING OUT.

02:09.367 --> 02:11.167
- YEAH, YOUR TONGUE
IS THE LEASH SHE USES

02:11.167 --> 02:12.733
TO PARADE YOU
AROUND THE PARK.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.067
[laughing]

02:14.067 --> 02:16.800
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
WORST IN SHOW!

02:16.800 --> 02:18.100
- YEAH, YEAH.

02:18.100 --> 02:19.633
YEAH, WELL, THEN MAYBE

02:19.633 --> 02:21.367
THAT'S WHY I SHOULD
TURN HER DOWN.

02:21.367 --> 02:23.200
SO SHE DOESN'T
TAKE ME FOR GRANTED.

02:23.200 --> 02:27.067
YOU KNOW? I MEAN, SHE'S GOT TO
APPRECIATE WHAT SHE'S GOT HERE.

02:27.067 --> 02:30.933
- YES, YOU'RE QUITE A CATCH.

02:30.933 --> 02:34.833
I CAN HARDLY
KEEP MY HANDS OFF YOU.

02:34.833 --> 02:38.467
COME ON, COME ON!

02:38.467 --> 02:40.533
- STUPID.

02:45.967 --> 02:48.267
- HEY.
- HEY.

02:51.067 --> 02:54.100
- OH,
I LEFT THE HALLWAY LIGHT ON.

02:54.100 --> 02:56.067
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

03:04.533 --> 03:05.667
I CAN SAY "NO."

03:05.667 --> 03:07.367
I CAN SAY
"NO."

03:23.067 --> 03:25.167
- YOU ALREADY ASLEEP?

03:25.167 --> 03:28.667
- HUH? WHAT?

03:28.667 --> 03:30.067
- YOU MUST BE TIRED.

03:30.067 --> 03:32.067
- OH, YEAH,
I AM KIND OF BEAT.

03:32.067 --> 03:33.800
YOU KNOW, I JUST--
I GOT A LOT OF...

03:33.800 --> 03:36.900
STUFF...

03:36.900 --> 03:40.600
...GOING ON.

03:40.600 --> 03:43.933
MAYBE TOMORROW.

03:43.933 --> 03:47.067
- REALLY?

03:47.067 --> 03:49.233
- YEAH...

03:52.700 --> 03:54.833
- OKAY.

03:54.833 --> 03:56.767
WELL, NIGHT.

03:56.767 --> 03:58.067
- YEAH.

03:58.067 --> 04:00.633
[yawns]
GOOD NIGHT.

04:11.467 --> 04:13.100
WHERE WERE YOU, MAN?
COME ON, LET'S GO!

04:13.100 --> 04:15.667
- AH, I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA
GO HIT BALLS TODAY.

04:15.667 --> 04:16.867
- WHAT--WHAT?

04:16.867 --> 04:18.867
OH, WHAT, DID THE WIFE
SAY YOU CAN'T GO?

04:18.867 --> 04:22.667
- NO, NO, JUST A LITTLE
STIFF, THAT'S ALL.

04:22.667 --> 04:25.767
- OH, SO IT'S
A MEDICAL DECISION

04:25.767 --> 04:28.433
YOU'RE MAKING
TO STAY HERE AND...

04:28.433 --> 04:31.867
- HELP AMY PICK OUT DRAPES.

04:31.867 --> 04:33.700
- [chuckles]

04:33.700 --> 04:35.467
AH, DRAPES, YEAH.

04:35.467 --> 04:37.200
WELL, IF THERE'S ANY
MATERIAL LEFT OVER,

04:37.200 --> 04:39.700
WHY DON'T YOU MAKE YOURSELF
A LITTLE SKIRT?

04:46.367 --> 04:47.967
I'M STILL GONNA GO,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:47.967 --> 04:50.600
I MAY GO TOMORROW, BECAUSE
I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.067
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

04:52.067 --> 04:55.800
- ALL RIGHT, YOU THOUGHT I
COULDN'T TURN DOWN DEBRA, RIGHT?

04:55.800 --> 04:57.367
TWO TIMES, MY FRIEND!

04:57.367 --> 04:59.067
YEAH, LAST NIGHT,
I TOLD HER

04:59.067 --> 05:00.567
THAT I HAD A LOT
OF WORK TO DO TODAY.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.700
[scoffs]
WORK!

05:02.700 --> 05:05.167
AND THEN--AND THEN,
FIRST THING THIS MORNING,

05:05.167 --> 05:06.467
SHE STARTED HINTING AGAIN.

05:06.467 --> 05:08.800
SHE EVEN BRUSHED HER TEETH
AND EVERYTHING,

05:08.800 --> 05:11.067
BUT NO SALE!

05:11.067 --> 05:12.333
AH, IT'S AMAZING, IT'S LIKE--

05:12.333 --> 05:13.867
IT'S LIKE EVERY TIME
I TURN HER DOWN,

05:13.867 --> 05:15.067
SHE SEEMS TO WANT IT MORE.

05:15.067 --> 05:19.067
SHE'S LIKE A GUY.

05:19.067 --> 05:21.600
- HUH, AND SHE'S
NOT GETTING UPSET?

05:21.600 --> 05:24.233
- NO, NO, NO, THAT'S JUST IT.

05:24.233 --> 05:25.900
SHE'S BEEN TREATING ME
BETTER ALL DAY.

05:25.900 --> 05:28.067
I CAME IN THIS MORNING, SHE
WAS MAKING ME A CHEESE OMELET.

05:28.067 --> 05:31.633
I MEAN, SHE HASN'T DONE THAT
SINCE BEFORE ALLY WAS BORN!

05:31.633 --> 05:36.500
I MEAN, YEAH,
IT HAD SHELLS IN IT, BUT STILL.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.233
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'VE DISCOVERED?

05:38.233 --> 05:41.267
THE POWER OF "NO."

05:41.267 --> 05:43.567
- "THE POWER OF 'NO.'"
GIVE ME A BREAK.

05:43.567 --> 05:45.433
- HEY, HEY, HEY, WHO GETS TO HIT
A BUCKET OF BALLS

05:45.433 --> 05:47.367
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY?

05:47.367 --> 05:49.067
- YEAH, WELL,
THAT'S JUST THE DIFFERENCE

05:49.067 --> 05:50.633
BETWEEN ME AND YOU,
RAYMOND.

05:50.633 --> 05:52.900
YOU LIKE TO GOLF BY YOURSELF
AND HAVE A CRAPPY OMELET,

05:52.900 --> 05:56.667
WHILE I PREFER SEX.

05:56.667 --> 05:58.533
- NO.
- YES.

05:58.533 --> 06:00.300
- NO.

06:00.300 --> 06:02.067
NO, MAN,
YOU'RE NOT GETTIN' IT.

06:02.067 --> 06:04.100
DEBRA CAN'T
KEEP HER HANDS OFF ME.

06:04.100 --> 06:05.767
IT'S LIKE WITH
THE POWER OF "NO"

06:05.767 --> 06:08.667
COMES THE POWER OF "YES."

06:08.667 --> 06:10.167
UH-HUH.

06:10.167 --> 06:11.433
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY MARRIAGE,

06:11.433 --> 06:12.767
I FINALLY KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE

06:12.767 --> 06:16.200
TO BE THE ONE
WEARIN' THE PANTIES.

06:19.733 --> 06:23.500
- YOU HAVE A WRONG AND
GENERALLY TROUBLED RELATIONSHIP.

06:23.500 --> 06:24.900
- NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, I DON'T.

06:24.900 --> 06:27.067
IT'S VERY RIGHT.

06:27.067 --> 06:28.200
- THEN LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

06:28.200 --> 06:29.533
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
FEEL THE NEED

06:29.533 --> 06:31.767
TO BE MANIPULATIVE
WHEN IT COMES TO SEX?

06:31.767 --> 06:32.800
- BECAUSE...

06:32.800 --> 06:36.067
I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT IT.

06:36.067 --> 06:37.600
- YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD
AT WHAT?

06:37.600 --> 06:38.900
- OH, YOU NAME IT.

06:38.900 --> 06:40.700
HEY, LISTEN, ROBERT--
HE CAN'T GO HIT BALLS,

06:40.700 --> 06:42.233
BUT I WAS THINKIN'
THAT I'D STILL GO.

06:42.233 --> 06:43.967
- YEAH, SURE, GO.
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

06:43.967 --> 06:46.067
- ALL RIGHT.

06:50.967 --> 06:52.167
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:52.167 --> 06:53.433
THEY GOT A GREAT
HOT DOG GUY THERE.

06:53.433 --> 06:54.933
YOU WANT ME
TO BRING YOU BACK ONE?

06:54.933 --> 06:57.767
- NO, I SHOULDN'T.
I GOT TO WATCH MY FIGURE.

06:57.767 --> 07:01.067
- HEY, YOU LET ME BE THE ONE
TO WATCH YOUR FIGURE.

07:01.067 --> 07:03.200
- [giggles]

07:05.200 --> 07:06.867
- "LET ME WATCH YOUR FIGURE"?

07:06.867 --> 07:08.300
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

07:08.300 --> 07:13.867
- THAT'S RIGHT, IT'S NOT,
AND YET, IT IS!

07:13.867 --> 07:16.133
BECAUSE SHE IS WEAK.

07:16.133 --> 07:19.733
WEAK...FOR MY PHYSIQUE.

07:22.933 --> 07:25.600
[clattering]

07:48.800 --> 07:49.867
- OH, DON'T THOSE LOOK NICE?

07:49.867 --> 07:51.267
- YEAH.

07:51.267 --> 07:52.933
I DON'T KNOW WHY ROBERT
HAD SUCH A HARD TIME

07:52.933 --> 07:54.333
PUTTING THEM UP YESTERDAY.

07:54.333 --> 07:56.433
- WELL, HE CAN'T HANDLE
NORMAL-SIZED TOOLS

07:56.433 --> 08:00.200
WITH THOSE GIANT FINGERS.

08:00.200 --> 08:01.933
HERE, PUSH THAT CURTAIN OVER
A LITTLE

08:01.933 --> 08:06.267
SO WE DON'T SEE HIS BLOOD.

08:06.267 --> 08:07.933
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK,
DEB?

08:07.933 --> 08:09.800
- YEAH, THEY LOOK GREAT.

08:09.800 --> 08:11.067
- DEBRA, DEAR.

08:11.067 --> 08:13.833
YOU'RE BEING SO QUIET.

08:13.833 --> 08:16.600
THAT'S NOT LIKE YOU.

08:16.600 --> 08:20.833
- NO, I'M FINE, IT'S JUST--

08:20.833 --> 08:22.367
DO I LOOK DIFFERENT
TO YOU?

08:22.367 --> 08:23.700
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

08:23.700 --> 08:27.067
- I DON'T KNOW,
I'M JUST FEELING--

08:27.067 --> 08:30.533
HAVE I DROOPED?

08:30.533 --> 08:31.900
- DROOPED?

08:31.900 --> 08:36.300
- YOU KNOW, YOU TRY TO WORK OUT
AND TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF,

08:36.300 --> 08:39.067
AND YET THERE STILL COMES A DAY
WHEN EVERYTHING JUST...

08:39.067 --> 08:41.133
[mimics exploding sound]

08:41.133 --> 08:44.667
- I WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

08:47.433 --> 08:49.700
- OH, STOP IT, DEB.
YOU LOOK GREAT.

08:49.700 --> 08:52.867
- YOU KNOW HOW MY FRIENDS
AND I KEEP FIT?

08:52.867 --> 08:55.200
WATER AEROBICS AT THE "Y."

08:55.200 --> 08:57.800
SAY, WHY DON'T YOU
COME WITH US TOMORROW?

08:57.800 --> 09:00.800
- OH, WOW, I'LL HAVE TO CHECK
AND SEE IF I'M FREE.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.500
- OH, WE'LL HAVE A BALL!

09:02.500 --> 09:05.733
LET ME GO LOOK
FOR AN EXTRA PAIR OF NOSE CLIPS

09:05.733 --> 09:07.400
AND A SWIM CAP.

09:15.367 --> 09:18.167
- DEBRA, YOU'RE REALLY
UPSET ABOUT THIS.

09:22.333 --> 09:25.133
- RAY KEEPS TURNING ME DOWN.

09:25.133 --> 09:28.067
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, SEX?
- YEAH.

09:28.067 --> 09:29.633
- THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE HIM.

09:29.633 --> 09:32.067
HE USUALLY FOLLOWS YOU AROUND
WITH HIS TONGUE HANGING OUT.

09:32.067 --> 09:33.433
- I KNOW.

09:36.067 --> 09:37.967
- WELL, I'M SURE IT'S NOT YOU.

09:37.967 --> 09:40.867
HEY, MAYBE HE'S SICK.
- NAH.

09:40.867 --> 09:43.100
I WISH HE WAS.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.733
OH, MAN, WHO AM I KIDDING?

09:44.733 --> 09:46.733
I SHOULD JUST GO
WITH MARIE TO THE "Y,"

09:46.733 --> 09:48.200
PUT ON A FLOWERY SWIM CAP,

09:48.200 --> 09:51.500
AND FLOAT AROUND
WITH THE OLD LADIES.

09:51.500 --> 09:55.267
- YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY,
YOU BRINGING THIS UP,

09:55.267 --> 09:57.533
BECAUSE LAST NIGHT
WHEN ROBERT AND I WENT TO BED,

09:57.533 --> 10:00.733
HE WAS ACTING
KIND OF DISTANT TOO.

10:00.733 --> 10:02.933
BUT THEN I JUST
KISSED HIS NECK, AND HE SAID,

10:02.933 --> 10:06.967
"RAY'S CRAZY."

10:06.967 --> 10:08.200
- HE DID?

10:08.200 --> 10:10.233
- YEAH, AND THEN HE SAID
SOMETHING ABOUT

10:10.233 --> 10:12.567
HOW I COULD HAVE
ALL THE POWER.

10:12.567 --> 10:14.100
IT WAS WEIRD.

10:14.100 --> 10:19.367
YEAH, HE USUALLY DOESN'T LIKE
TO MENTION RAY IN THE BEDROOM.

10:19.367 --> 10:23.167
HE SAYS IT INHIBITS HIM.

10:23.167 --> 10:25.033
- "THE POWER"?

10:25.033 --> 10:28.900
I MEAN, WHY WOULD HE SAY--

10:28.900 --> 10:30.767
OH...

10:30.767 --> 10:31.800
- WHAT?

10:31.800 --> 10:34.233
- OH, MY GOD.

10:34.233 --> 10:35.800
OH, MY GOD!

10:35.800 --> 10:39.067
HE HAS BEEN
TURNING ME DOWN ON PURPOSE!

10:39.067 --> 10:40.933
- OH, NO,
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

10:40.933 --> 10:44.800
- FOR THE POWER!

10:44.800 --> 10:47.967
HE THINKS IT GIVES HIM
THE UPPER HAND OR SOMETHING.

10:47.967 --> 10:50.833
- WELL, THAT'S GROSS.

10:50.833 --> 10:52.100
HEY, BUT LOOK ON
THE BRIGHT SIDE.

10:52.100 --> 10:53.333
THIS MEANS YOU'RE STILL HOT.

10:53.333 --> 10:56.233
- OF COURSE I AM.

10:56.233 --> 10:57.967
YOU KNOW WHAT THE WORST PART
ABOUT THIS IS?

10:57.967 --> 10:59.500
THAT IT WORKED.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.533
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE MYSELF
LOOK BETTER FOR HIM.

11:01.533 --> 11:04.067
DO YOU KNOW I DID
138 SIT UPS THIS MORNING?

11:04.067 --> 11:05.333
ALL FOR SOME GUY
WHOSE STOMACH

11:05.333 --> 11:10.067
LOOKS LIKE A DEFLATED
CLOWN BALLOON!

11:10.067 --> 11:12.600
- OH, BOY, YOU'RE GONNA
KILL HIM, AREN'T YOU?

11:12.600 --> 11:13.933
- NO.

11:13.933 --> 11:18.067
NO, I WANT HIM ALIVE.

11:26.167 --> 11:27.733
- HEY, JIMMYJACK.

11:27.733 --> 11:29.067
- HEY.

11:29.067 --> 11:30.067
HOW WAS WORK?

11:30.067 --> 11:31.900
- GOOD. WHERE ARE THE KIDS?

11:31.900 --> 11:33.400
- I SENT THEM OVER
TO THE PARKERS.

11:33.400 --> 11:34.400
- WHY?

11:34.400 --> 11:36.800
- I WANTED THEM
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

11:36.800 --> 11:39.500
- OH, YEAH?

11:39.500 --> 11:41.067
- I DIDN'T THINK
IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE

11:41.067 --> 11:44.067
FOR THE CHILDREN TO SEE
WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO TO YOU.

11:44.067 --> 11:47.433
- OH, GOSH, REALLY, DEB?

11:47.433 --> 11:49.967
RIGHT NOW? I DON'T KNOW.

11:49.967 --> 11:53.400
I MEAN, I GOT A LOT TO DO.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.133
REALLY, DEB, I THINK--

11:55.133 --> 12:01.100
- [whispers]
YOU'RE JUST SO POWERFUL.

12:01.100 --> 12:02.667
- YEAH, YEAH, WELL--

12:02.667 --> 12:07.567
- I JUST CAN'T RESIST A MAN
WITH SO MUCH POWER.

12:07.567 --> 12:10.433
- OKAY, LOOK, I'M REALLY
STARTING TO FEEL A LITTLE--

12:10.433 --> 12:12.567
[screams]

12:16.067 --> 12:17.567
WHAT'S WITH YOU?

12:17.567 --> 12:20.167
- ROBERT TOLD AMY
WHY YOU'VE BEEN TURNING ME DOWN.

12:20.167 --> 12:24.733
- I HATE THAT GUY!

12:24.733 --> 12:27.067
- SO YOU WERE
JUST TOYING WITH ME,

12:27.067 --> 12:28.967
GETTING ME TO BEG FOR SEX?

12:28.967 --> 12:30.467
THAT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD?

12:30.467 --> 12:32.633
- NO, NO, I DON'T KNOW,
I JUST--

12:32.633 --> 12:34.233
I GUESS I WANTED
TO SEE WHAT IT WAS LIKE

12:34.233 --> 12:36.567
TO BE THE ONE
BEING PURSUED FOR ONCE.

12:36.567 --> 12:38.933
- BUT YOU MADE ME FEEL
TERRIBLE ABOUT MYSELF!

12:38.933 --> 12:40.300
YOU JUST KEPT REJECTING ME.

12:40.300 --> 12:42.533
HOW COULD YOU
DO THAT TO SOMEBODY?

12:42.533 --> 12:45.267
- WHAT?

12:45.267 --> 12:49.367
- YOU HAD ME CONVINCED
I WAS A FAT, UGLY, OLD LADY!

12:49.367 --> 12:51.967
- WELL,
NOW YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL!

12:51.967 --> 12:54.867
YOU FEEL BAD BECAUSE I TURNED
YOU DOWN, WHAT, THREE TIMES?

12:54.867 --> 12:57.700
TRY BEING REJECTED
40 OR 50 TIMES EVERY YEAR

12:57.700 --> 12:59.067
FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS!

12:59.067 --> 13:00.333
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT FEELS?

13:00.333 --> 13:01.500
YOU'RE LOOKIN'
AT THE PRESIDENT

13:01.500 --> 13:04.067
OF THE FAT, UGLY,
OLD LADIES CLUB!

13:04.067 --> 13:06.600
WELCOME! HAVE A DONUT!

13:06.600 --> 13:09.800
- THERE IS NO WAY
I TURN YOU DOWN THAT MUCH.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.433
AND I SAY "YES" A LOT.

13:11.433 --> 13:13.433
- EXACTLY! YOU SAY YES,
AND YOU SAY NO.

13:13.433 --> 13:15.733
YOU'RE THE--YOU'RE THE BOUNCER
IN FRONT OF THE DISCO

13:15.733 --> 13:17.467
WHO DECIDES WHO GETS IN
AND WHO DOESN'T.

13:17.467 --> 13:19.533
AND FOR ONCE,
IT WAS YOU STANDIN' OUTSIDE.

13:19.533 --> 13:21.200
YEAH,
AND YOU COULDN'T TAKE IT.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.733
YEAH,
IT'S COLD OUT THERE, ISN'T IT?

13:22.733 --> 13:24.200
STANDING IN THE RAIN,

13:24.200 --> 13:26.800
WITH YOUR BAD SHIRT
AND YOUR ACNE PIMPLES.

13:26.800 --> 13:29.133
- THERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN
COMPARE ME TURNING YOU DOWN

13:29.133 --> 13:30.367
WITH WHAT YOU DID TO ME!

13:30.367 --> 13:31.567
LISTEN, RAY,
IF I TURN YOU DOWN,

13:31.567 --> 13:33.067
IT IS
BECAUSE I AM EXHAUSTED

13:33.067 --> 13:34.667
FROM TAKING CARE
OF THREE KIDS ALL DAY

13:34.667 --> 13:37.867
AND THINKING OF EVERYTHING
THAT I HAVE TO DO THE NEXT DAY.

13:37.867 --> 13:42.100
- STILL USING THE KIDS, HUH?

13:42.100 --> 13:43.833
- OH, MY GOD.

13:43.833 --> 13:46.867
I CAN'T BELIEVE I EVER WANTED
TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.900
- WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY,
BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE

13:48.900 --> 13:50.600
THE NEXT TIME
YOU'RE GETTING SEX FROM ME.

13:50.600 --> 13:53.633
- OH, YOU'RE THREATENING ME
WITH NO SEX?

13:53.633 --> 13:54.700
PLEASE.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.200
- YEAH,
YOU WILL BE SAYING PLEASE--

13:56.200 --> 13:59.600
PRETTY PLEASE WITH SUGAR ON TOP.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.067
I'M SERIOUS.

14:01.067 --> 14:03.433
I DON'T KNOW WHEN
I'LL BE IN THE MOOD AGAIN.

14:03.433 --> 14:05.367
- YOU ARE ALWAYS IN THE MOOD.

14:05.367 --> 14:07.200
YOU WOULDN'T LAST A NIGHT.

14:07.200 --> 14:10.567
- I JUST DID THREE NIGHTS,
LADY PANTALOONS.

14:10.567 --> 14:13.900
OKAY?
SO WE'LL SEE WHO CAN'T LAST.

14:13.900 --> 14:15.200
- [southern accent]
OH, MY.

14:15.200 --> 14:17.900
HOW WILL I EVER
RESIST MY BASER INSTINCTS?

14:17.900 --> 14:19.467
- YEAH, I LIKE THAT.

14:19.467 --> 14:20.867
I LIKE THE SOUTHERN THING.

14:20.867 --> 14:22.600
THAT'LL BE GOOD
WHEN YOU COME BACK SAYING,

14:22.600 --> 14:26.067
[southern accent] "PRETTY PLEASE
WITH SUGAR ON TOP."

14:38.833 --> 14:41.767
- OKAY, WELL, GOOD--

14:41.767 --> 14:43.700
[groans]

15:07.867 --> 15:11.067
OH, MY GOD,

15:11.067 --> 15:13.600

15:13.600 --> 15:15.333
YOU WANT TO FEEL?

15:18.167 --> 15:20.267
- THAT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT.

15:22.267 --> 15:25.600

ALL YOUR LACY APPAREL?

15:25.600 --> 15:26.867
- NOTHING.

15:26.867 --> 15:28.233
IT'S JUST PAJAMAS.

15:47.967 --> 15:50.800
GOOD NIGHT.

15:50.800 --> 15:52.500
- YEAH.

15:52.500 --> 15:56.567
YEAH, YEAH,
I'M A LITTLE TIRED TOO.

15:56.567 --> 15:59.700
[groans]

16:05.267 --> 16:09.567
- DID YOU PUT OIL ON?

16:09.567 --> 16:11.067
- NO.

16:11.067 --> 16:14.200
IT'S JUST MY NATURAL JUICES.

16:37.633 --> 16:39.767
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:39.767 --> 16:41.433
- ME?

16:41.433 --> 16:44.967
WHAT, DID YOU HAVE MY MOM
PUT YOUR MAKEUP ON?

16:44.967 --> 16:48.267
- NO SEX FOR YOU!

16:48.267 --> 16:52.767
- NO SEX FOR YOU.

16:55.367 --> 17:01.500
[jazzy lounge music]

18:03.667 --> 18:06.067
ALL RIGHT, YOU WIN!

18:14.100 --> 18:16.933
- WHAT?

18:16.933 --> 18:18.433
I AM OFFICIALLY
ASKING YOU

18:18.433 --> 18:21.800
TO PLEASE
HAVE SOME SEX WITH ME.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.633
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

18:23.633 --> 18:26.933
- OUR THING.
OUR NOT HAVING SEX THING.

18:26.933 --> 18:28.700
- ARE WE STILL DOING THAT?

18:32.533 --> 18:34.367
- OF COURSE
WE'RE STILL DOING IT.

18:34.367 --> 18:35.967
IT'S BEEN 26 DAYS
OF DOING IT--

18:35.967 --> 18:37.567
NOT DOING IT.

18:37.567 --> 18:40.733
- I'M SORRY.
I TOTALLY FORGOT.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.233
- YEAH, RIGHT.

18:44.233 --> 18:45.600

18:45.600 --> 18:47.700
BUT REALLY,
I TOTALLY FORGOT.

18:47.700 --> 18:49.233
- PLEASE.

18:49.233 --> 18:51.633
YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE THAT
YOU DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WE--

18:51.633 --> 18:55.067
WE WENT 26 DAYS
WITHOUT HAVING SEX?

18:57.800 --> 18:59.767
- IT'S JUST,
I'VE BEEN REALLY BUSY.

18:59.767 --> 19:02.500
YOU KNOW, THE PTA FUND-RAISER
IS COMING UP,

19:02.500 --> 19:06.433
AND I'VE JUST HAD
A LOT ON MY MIND.

19:10.700 --> 19:13.900
- 26 DAYS.

19:13.900 --> 19:17.733
YOU WEREN'T EVEN TRYING.

19:17.733 --> 19:21.733
GUESS I WAS NEVER REALLY CLOSE
TO HAVIN' THE POWER, WAS I?

19:21.733 --> 19:23.533
- SORRY.

19:25.467 --> 19:28.333
- ALL THIS TIME,
I-I THOUGHT YOU WERE DOIN'

19:28.333 --> 19:30.700
ALL THOSE LITTLE THINGS
TO TORTURE ME.

19:30.700 --> 19:32.067
- WHAT THINGS?

19:32.067 --> 19:34.533
- FORGET IT.

19:34.533 --> 19:36.067
- NO, COME ON.

19:36.067 --> 19:37.700
- YOU KNOW.

19:37.700 --> 19:38.867
LIKE BITE YOUR LOWER LIP

19:38.867 --> 19:40.800
WHEN YOU USE THE REMOTE
TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL.

19:40.800 --> 19:43.567
- I DO THAT?
- YEAH!

19:43.567 --> 19:45.267
OR HOW ABOUT
WHEN YOU KEEP ONE OF YOUR LEGS

19:45.267 --> 19:48.433
OUTSIDE OF THE COVERS
AND THE PAJAMA RIDES UP IT?

19:48.433 --> 19:50.500
- IT'S JUST BECAUSE I'M HOT.

19:50.500 --> 19:53.600
- YES, YOU ARE!

19:53.600 --> 19:55.367
EVEN WHEN YOU SLEEP,
EVERY SO OFTEN,

19:55.367 --> 19:57.800
YOU KIND OF SIGH A LITTLE.

19:57.800 --> 20:00.367
[sighs quietly]

20:00.367 --> 20:02.367
- YOU HAVEN'T
SLEPT MUCH LATELY, HAVE YOU?

20:02.367 --> 20:05.533
- NO.

20:05.533 --> 20:07.033
EVEN NOW.

20:07.033 --> 20:08.767
LOOK AT YOU.

20:08.767 --> 20:11.033
WITH YOUR HAIR LIKE THAT,

20:11.033 --> 20:13.700
SITTIN' THERE IN YOUR...

20:13.700 --> 20:15.600
ROBE.

20:17.033 --> 20:19.900
- I'M A MESS.

20:19.900 --> 20:23.100
- YEAH, WELL, I GUESS
EVEN WHEN YOU'RE NOT TRYIN',

20:23.100 --> 20:25.000
IT STILL WORKS.

20:31.167 --> 20:32.800
- WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

20:32.800 --> 20:35.633
- YOU JUST GOT
A LITTLE OF YOUR POWER BACK.

20:35.633 --> 20:38.167
- [laughs]

20:38.167 --> 20:40.933
WHOA, WHOA, WAIT, WAIT.

20:40.933 --> 20:44.000
ARE YOU TOYING WITH ME?

20:44.000 --> 20:45.500
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE,

20:45.500 --> 20:48.333
I'M JUST GONNA
START TO CRY.

20:50.567 --> 20:52.900
- I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
FOR A LONG TIME, TOO, RAY.

20:52.900 --> 20:56.733
AND BY THE WAY,
IT'S BEEN 27 DAYS, NOT 26.

20:56.733 --> 21:03.067
- AH, YOU DO RE--

21:03.067 --> 21:04.867
--MEMBER!
- [laughs]

21:04.867 --> 21:07.867

21:07.867 --> 21:12.067

21:12.067 --> 21:15.167
- WE LIVE HERE.

21:15.167 --> 21:17.200
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

21:17.200 --> 21:19.067
HEY, YOU GUYS CAN
MAKE BREAKFAST YOURSELF, RIGHT?

21:19.067 --> 21:22.300
'CAUSE DADDY HAS TO TALK TO
MOMMY UPSTAIRS ABOUT SOMETHING.

21:22.300 --> 21:24.633
- RAY.
- YEAH?

21:26.767 --> 21:29.133
[mumbles weakly]
