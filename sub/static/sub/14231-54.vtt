[straining] Can't miss the plane

01:12.072 --> 01:16.159
or we gotta wait 10 years for the next
family reunion of the Goof clan!

01:18.119 --> 01:21.664
Man, your pop is sure worked up
about this reunion thing, huh?

01:22.374 --> 01:25.669
Yeah. Well, Dad hasn't seen
the folks since he was just a kid.

01:26.836 --> 01:30.256
That's right! And they've
never even met Maxie! Ah-hyuck!

01:30.340 --> 01:32.717
We're not gonna disappoint
them this time, right?

01:32.801 --> 01:34.552
No way, Pop!

01:39.349 --> 01:41.101
-Did you give Peej the house key?
-Check!

01:41.184 --> 01:42.686
-Buy extra cat food?
-Check!

01:42.769 --> 01:44.437
Water the furniture and cover the flowers?

-Check! Check!
-Ah-hyuck!

01:46.106 --> 01:48.692
This is gonna be a great reunion!

01:48.775 --> 01:51.986
-Ya got the money for our tickets, Pop?
-Whoopsie!

01:52.696 --> 01:55.907
He's been saving for years for our super,
super, super, super, super, super,

01:55.990 --> 01:58.034
super saver fares.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.787
Recycled candy wrappers for a penny a ton.

02:00.870 --> 02:03.581
Sold all Waffles' fleas to a flea circus.

02:03.665 --> 02:07.836
Even went without mustard
on my ice cream to raise the last dime.

02:07.919 --> 02:11.089
[laughs] All here, 200 bucks.

02:11.172 --> 02:13.925
Hurry, Dad, plane leaves in 20 minutes!

02:14.009 --> 02:15.927
Hey, P.J., thanks for feeding Waffles.

02:16.011 --> 02:17.679
And if there are any problems, call us

02:17.762 --> 02:21.141
at Aunt Goophelia's ardvark
ranch in Tiera del Foongo.

02:21.224 --> 02:22.642
Whoa!

02:22.767 --> 02:26.396
[laughs] Fasten your seaty belt, Maxie.
We're on our way!

02:26.479 --> 02:28.481
Have a good trip!

02:30.900 --> 02:33.486
Aw, please! You can't quit now,

02:33.570 --> 02:36.156
The relatives'll miss
Maxie's childhood completely.

02:36.239 --> 02:37.574
-[alarm rings]
-Uh-oh,

02:37.657 --> 02:40.493
The "turn off your engine if you want to
have a car left" light just lit.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.162
We're sunk!

02:43.663 --> 02:46.332
Not if Petey can wave a magic doohickey.

02:46.958 --> 02:48.752
Petey, help!

02:50.670 --> 02:52.839
[grunts] Car's sick.

02:52.922 --> 02:55.133
Got a plane to catch!
Leaves in 10 minutes!

02:55.550 --> 02:59.554
No sweat, Goofster.
You've come to the right place.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.515
[mumbling] Well, now, let me see here, um,

03:02.599 --> 03:04.476
got your thingamabob's OK,

03:04.559 --> 03:06.770
gravi-noodle is on the half shell,
which is good,

03:06.853 --> 03:10.231
your geegaws're greased...
Ha! Got a screw loose.

03:10.315 --> 03:12.567
Ah-hyuck! We know that, Petey.

03:12.650 --> 03:14.569
But I'm sure you can fix my car anyway.

03:15.111 --> 03:18.156
Not me, ya...
You got a screw loose in your engine!

03:18.782 --> 03:21.326
Oops! [chuckles] Natural mistake!

03:21.826 --> 03:24.621
Yeah, right. Well, you need a new one,
be a dollar.

03:24.788 --> 03:26.331
Mmm, here you go.

03:28.541 --> 03:31.294
Hold on just a money-grubbing minuto!

03:31.378 --> 03:34.047
You also got a cranky crankcase,

03:34.130 --> 03:37.133
acid upset battery,
constipated carburetor, stuffy hose...

03:37.217 --> 03:39.386
Ooh, it's gonna cost you...
How much you say you had?

03:39.928 --> 03:43.181
Uh, 200 bucks, just enough
for two plane tickets

03:43.264 --> 03:46.017
to Tiera del Foongo to my family reunion.

03:46.101 --> 03:47.811
What do you know? Exactly what you owe me!

03:47.894 --> 03:51.564
With your discount, of course.
Lucky you broke down here, huh?

03:51.648 --> 03:53.149
Won't take long.

03:53.233 --> 03:56.653
While you're waiting,
have a free drink of H2 and O,

03:56.736 --> 03:59.656
Courtesy of Pete's used cars.

04:02.492 --> 04:03.660
[tires squeal]

04:04.285 --> 04:05.995
Max? What happened?

04:06.079 --> 04:08.248
I thought you were on your way
to your family reunion!

04:08.873 --> 04:12.293
We're gonna miss the reunion,
Mrs. P. Car broke down.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.212
Took our plane fare to fix it.

04:14.295 --> 04:17.298
Mr. P said we had an acid upset battery.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.926
Bloated repair bill's more like it!

04:20.010 --> 04:22.387
That tub of butter is not
gonna get away with this!

04:22.470 --> 04:25.765
-When's the reunion start?
-High noon tomorrow.

04:25.849 --> 04:32.147
It's the birthday of my great-great-great-
grandpappy, Gooferamus G. Goof.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.483
Max, I'll need your family's addresses.
P.J., start a shopping list.

04:35.567 --> 04:38.862
1-800-cable? Yes, I'd like to
send a telegram. Yes, I'll hold.

04:38.945 --> 04:41.823
We're going to wire the Goofs,
fly them all up to Spoonerville,

04:41.906 --> 04:46.578
Put them up at our house and surprise
Goofy with a big reunion bash.

04:47.078 --> 04:50.665
Yes! But how'll we pay for it all?

04:50.749 --> 04:53.918
We won't! Pete will! [chuckles]

04:54.002 --> 04:57.422
[chuckles nervously]
Uh, shouldn't you ask him first?

04:57.505 --> 05:01.926
Oh, don't be silly!
Why ruin such a wonderful surprise?

05:03.428 --> 05:05.847
[snoring]

05:05.930 --> 05:08.767
[doorbell rings]

05:08.850 --> 05:12.896
[grumbles] Who in the name of insomnia...

05:15.106 --> 05:17.233
[doorbell ringing]

05:22.113 --> 05:24.199
Hello! Ah-hyuck!

05:24.282 --> 05:26.826
Peddle your pots someplace else,
you walking nightmare.

05:26.910 --> 05:28.370
I don't buy in my sleep!

05:28.745 --> 05:31.456
Aw, it's just some supperware lady.

05:31.539 --> 05:32.916
[doorbell ringing]

05:34.501 --> 05:38.046
[gasps] why I bet that's...
Aunt Goophelia?

05:38.129 --> 05:40.715
And you must be Peg and Pete!

05:40.799 --> 05:42.926
So lovely of ya to open your home!

05:43.009 --> 05:45.679
Hope you don't mind
that I brought my kitchen,

05:45.762 --> 05:50.225
But it's impossible to cook
our family dishes in just any old pot!

05:50.308 --> 05:53.645
Ah-hyuck! Ooh, wait till you
taste my torpedo chicken,

05:53.728 --> 05:56.231
Guaranteed to sink the strongest stomach.

05:56.314 --> 06:00.652
I'm already salivating!
You can dump your pans in the kitchen.

06:00.735 --> 06:04.114
-[whispers] What's going on?
-[scoffs] Just a little party.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.991
At 2:00 a.m. O'clock in the morning?

06:07.075 --> 06:08.076
[doorbell rings]

06:08.159 --> 06:09.744
Get that. Will you, Hon?

06:10.495 --> 06:15.417
Great-Uncle Pattonleather Goof,
reporting for reunion duty! Ah-hyuck!

06:15.500 --> 06:16.793
What reunion... [groans]

06:16.876 --> 06:20.088
-[utensils clanking]
-Pattonleather!

06:20.171 --> 06:25.093
[laughs] How many couch potaters
you turn into a limp spaghetti lately?

06:25.176 --> 06:27.971
Just about got the whole country in shape!

06:28.096 --> 06:29.764
'Cept for him! Ah-hyuck!

06:29.848 --> 06:33.601
Gonna save ya from a flabby end
for doing what you're doing for Goofy.

06:33.685 --> 06:35.103
Drop and gimme 20!

06:35.186 --> 06:36.855
Straight through the dining room.

06:36.938 --> 06:39.232
Our house is your house.

06:39.649 --> 06:41.026
-Who are these yo-yos?
-[doorbell rings]

06:41.109 --> 06:43.737
They look like, [coughs] Goofy!

06:43.820 --> 06:46.781
Mmm, yes, there is quite
a family resemblance.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.950
Goofy's family?

06:51.161 --> 06:54.497
Peg, I demand to know what-- Whoa!

06:56.458 --> 06:57.917
[gasps]

06:58.001 --> 07:02.088
[gasps] Oh! You must be
cousin Werner Von Goof!

07:04.382 --> 07:05.550
Whoa!

07:05.633 --> 07:08.219
Gonna save you billions
of hours of drudgery,

07:08.303 --> 07:11.806
starting with your stove!
Talk about fast food.

07:11.890 --> 07:14.809
[gulps] Stop, you've done enough damage!

07:14.893 --> 07:17.979
Shh! Pete! That's no way
to treat our guests!

07:18.063 --> 07:21.399
Guests? They are not staying here!

07:21.483 --> 07:23.318
Oh, just until the reunion.

07:23.401 --> 07:25.987
-What?
-[M. Angelo] Hold that pose!

07:26.071 --> 07:28.031
Magnifique!

07:28.114 --> 07:30.658
A smudge of post-cubicle expressionism,

07:30.742 --> 07:34.079
a splatter of la-de-dada and...

07:39.125 --> 07:40.085
Voila.

07:40.168 --> 07:45.173
An M. Angelo Goof original portrait
to thank you for your generosity!

07:45.256 --> 07:48.301
Someday, it will be
worth the small fortune

07:48.385 --> 07:50.345
you're spending on Goofy's reunion. oui?

07:50.428 --> 07:53.056
I'm spending a fortune?

07:53.139 --> 07:56.476
Yes, to make up for ripping off
Goofy's money.

07:56.559 --> 08:00.105
Oui. and I kiss you!

08:00.814 --> 08:04.401
[grunts] Get away from me,
ya disgusting...

08:05.276 --> 08:07.654
Whoa!

08:07.737 --> 08:08.863
[yells]

08:08.947 --> 08:09.989
[crashes]

08:11.658 --> 08:15.120
If you're not going to help, Peter,
please stay out of the way!

08:18.915 --> 08:24.087
The only thing I'm helping with is getting
these Goofburgers outta here yesterday!

08:24.170 --> 08:27.966
Not unless you want to do
your own cooking and cleaning

08:28.049 --> 08:30.260
and sunburn peeling forever!

08:30.343 --> 08:32.637
Huh? Uh, well, yeah,

08:32.721 --> 08:35.098
I suppose it is nice
that they can stay till...

08:35.181 --> 08:38.560
-when's this reunion?
-High noon tomorrow.

08:38.643 --> 08:43.148
[shudders] Gotta hang on
for nine hours, 540 minutes...

08:43.231 --> 08:44.649
Ooh! That's a lot of seconds.

08:45.275 --> 08:46.818
I know you're all tired.

08:46.901 --> 08:51.197
Uh, Werner, you can sleep on the couch,
and we've got extra beds upstairs.

08:51.281 --> 08:54.034
C'mon, we gotta call Max!

08:54.117 --> 08:58.079
But I'm afraid someone will have
to sleep in the basement!

08:58.163 --> 09:01.082
[mutters] It better not be...

09:01.166 --> 09:02.959
Me!

09:03.043 --> 09:05.670
[groans]

09:07.047 --> 09:09.841
Oh, how sweet!

09:11.676 --> 09:14.721
[phone rings]

09:17.390 --> 09:20.852
-[P.J.] Max?
-Mmm, yeah, Peej?

09:20.935 --> 09:23.938
They're here!

09:27.442 --> 09:31.237
All I want's a Goof-free cup of coffee.

09:31.321 --> 09:32.906
Aw, look at you!

09:32.989 --> 09:35.075
Bet your tummy's running on empty!

09:35.158 --> 09:39.412
I'm gonna stoke your engine with
a pot of my fire-breath chili!

09:39.496 --> 09:42.457
[swallowing]

09:42.540 --> 09:44.417
[coughs]

09:44.501 --> 09:48.338
[alarm ringing]

09:50.423 --> 09:54.386
[sniffling] If I can't see
the family in living color,

09:54.469 --> 09:57.305
black and white's better than nothing!

10:06.189 --> 10:07.565
Oops!

10:08.608 --> 10:12.153
Now, how about chasing
that with my hot salsa tea?

10:12.987 --> 10:15.615
[raspy choking]
I think I'd rather have water!

10:15.699 --> 10:17.450
[Goofy] yoo-hoo, Petey?

10:17.534 --> 10:20.370
Stop stuffing your face
and go see what Goofy wants!

10:20.453 --> 10:23.123
Keep him out of here until noon,
if you have to blow his nose,

10:23.206 --> 10:26.418
shine his shoes,
and take him to Disneyland!

10:27.377 --> 10:29.212
Just came to borrow your hammer.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.969
Gosh, for a minute I thought
I saw ya breathing fire!

10:36.052 --> 10:37.721
[muffled groan]

10:37.804 --> 10:39.931
[sniffling]

10:40.015 --> 10:42.684
[sobbing] Must miss my family so much

10:42.767 --> 10:47.022
I'm having a miragie about
Aunt Goophelia's fire-breath chili.

10:49.024 --> 10:50.817
Aw, never mind my hammer.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.778
I think I'll just go
and look at my family album.

10:53.862 --> 10:55.196
[sniffling]

10:56.698 --> 10:59.325
[siren blares]

11:01.661 --> 11:04.372
[gulps]

11:06.374 --> 11:07.459
[hiccups]

11:19.054 --> 11:21.097
Whoa!

11:25.018 --> 11:26.603
Leaping sweatbands!

11:26.686 --> 11:28.897
You must have gained 100 pounds overnight!

11:28.980 --> 11:31.232
Well, this calls for drastic measures!

11:31.316 --> 11:34.527
Give me 1,000 pushups with
the stereo on your back, son!

11:36.946 --> 11:40.075
Hooey, I can't. My lumbago...

11:40.158 --> 11:44.621
Lumbago? Well, that's a first
sign of terminal sedentaryitis!

11:44.704 --> 11:46.581
-It is?
-Why, yes, it is.

11:46.664 --> 11:49.292
Next thing you know your joints lock,
your blood hardens--

11:49.376 --> 11:50.251
It does?

11:50.335 --> 11:52.545
Unless my killer calisthenics

Bill of Rights about now,

12:35.547 --> 12:39.217
While Uncle Angelo finishes
decorating for the reunion.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.469
Now, the secret to art of the absurd

12:41.553 --> 12:44.055
is to do whatever comes
out from your head!

12:44.139 --> 12:45.765
Don't hold back, huh?

12:45.849 --> 12:50.979

13:21.259 --> 13:23.928
Created a masterpiece, no?

13:24.012 --> 13:27.223
[Pete yells] No!

13:28.725 --> 13:30.935
[Goofy] Petey, got a minute?

13:32.604 --> 13:34.439

13:34.522 --> 13:39.694
Oh, um, uh, just helping P.J.

It's already 10:00.
Only got two hours to hide!

14:09.057 --> 14:13.603
I'm gonna take the longest
shower and shave in history!

14:13.687 --> 14:16.439
Don't worry, I'll clean you up
in milliseconds!

14:16.523 --> 14:20.777
[sputtering] Whoa!
What are you doing? I gotta go!

14:20.860 --> 14:23.029
Don't you want to brush your teeth?

14:23.113 --> 14:26.032
We wouldn't want you to have

14:32.247 --> 14:34.749

I can't take this much longer.
I gotta get outta here!

14:37.669 --> 14:40.630
Oh, great! While you're out,
you can pick up a few groceries!

14:40.714 --> 14:42.382
[exclaims in surprise]

14:42.465 --> 14:44.634
You'd think we were feeding
these Goofs for a month!

14:44.718 --> 14:47.637
Well, actually, it's more like two weeks.

14:47.721 --> 14:50.140
No way! The reunion's at high noon.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.017
That's just one hour and 15 minutes.

14:52.100 --> 14:56.479
Oh-ho, that's just
the beginning. [chuckles]

14:57.564 --> 14:58.940
[nervous giggle]

14:59.065 --> 15:01.067

I gotta get rid of these Goofs.

15:01.151 --> 15:05.030
I gotta get rid of these Goofs.
I gotta... [gasps] bingo!

15:07.741 --> 15:11.327
Leaves at noon, takes passengers along
for a dirt-cheap fare.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.038
Hello, Slime O' The Sea?

15:13.121 --> 15:16.458
I want to book a gaggle of Goofs
to Tiera del Foongo.

15:16.541 --> 15:18.001
Of course!

15:18.084 --> 15:23.006
They'll think they're taking a tour
of the Spoonerville Harbor!

15:28.678 --> 15:30.347
Pile in, now! Gonna show ya the harbor

15:30.472 --> 15:32.974
while Peg and the kids put
the finishing touches on the celebration!

15:33.058 --> 15:35.977
And on the way, we'll get
your eyebrows in shape!

15:36.061 --> 15:39.022
Hoop-hah, hoop-hah, hoop-hah.

15:43.193 --> 15:47.238
That's right, two tickets to
Tiera del Foongo on the Slime O' The Sea,

15:47.322 --> 15:50.909
two bucks each, payable in 10 easy
20-cent installments.

15:50.992 --> 15:55.580
Might be a few days late,
but at least we'll get to see everyone!

15:55.705 --> 15:57.916
[Max] looks more like Dad than Dad!

15:57.999 --> 16:01.211
-He's not gonna believe this!
-Almost noon.

16:01.336 --> 16:03.546
You go get him, and we'll
round up the relatives.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.048
The party's on!

16:07.175 --> 16:11.137
Dad? Got a big surprise.

16:11.221 --> 16:14.683
And I got a bigger one.
[laughs] no peeking now!

16:14.766 --> 16:17.143
-But, Pop...
-No time to talk now!

16:17.268 --> 16:19.104

16:26.945 --> 16:29.280
I've done this tour 100 times!

16:29.364 --> 16:33.076
Better call Peg and check in.
Meet ya when you're done!

16:33.159 --> 16:38.873
Gosh! Thank you, Peter.
[laughs] You think of everything!

16:40.875 --> 16:43.086
[grunts]

16:44.546 --> 16:49.217
Sure do! Good-bye
and [chuckles] good riddance!

16:55.056 --> 16:57.183
When are we gonna get to my surprise?

16:57.308 --> 17:00.395
Not long now! Just hang onto your cowlick.

17:00.478 --> 17:03.565
Why, I bet we can even see
Goof's house from up here.

17:03.648 --> 17:07.360
He'd sure flip if he knew
how close we were! [laughs]

17:07.485 --> 17:10.321
[Max] Dad, how long's "not long"?

17:10.405 --> 17:14.492
No one's anywhere! But how could
all the Goofs vanish at once?

17:14.617 --> 17:18.538
Not to mention your father... Hmm...

17:18.621 --> 17:23.001
Pete's missing, too? Oh, he wouldn't!

17:23.126 --> 17:24.836
[all] Oh, yes, he would!

17:24.919 --> 17:26.254
[snorting laughter]

17:26.338 --> 17:29.257
Sometime I'm so brilliant, I scare myself!

17:30.759 --> 17:33.094
[stutters] Ooh... Hi, sweetbread!

17:33.178 --> 17:36.765
Um, uh, the Goofs, uh, said they're sorry.

17:36.848 --> 17:38.892
Uh, family emergency.
They had to leave early...

17:38.975 --> 17:40.185
[grunts]

17:40.268 --> 17:42.354
I'm not buying it, Peter.

17:42.437 --> 17:45.565
You have until noon to get them back here.
You got it?

17:45.940 --> 17:47.525
-Got it.
-Good!

17:48.193 --> 17:49.736

17:54.574 --> 17:56.368
Well, I've gotta find some Goofs!

17:56.451 --> 17:58.078
Not without a ticket ya don't!

17:58.328 --> 18:00.330
[gasps] Would you take an IOU?

18:00.413 --> 18:02.749
How about you take a hike!

And got us off on the wrong boat
so we were all together!

19:14.487 --> 19:17.782
[laughs] Ought to make him
guest of honor at our party!

19:17.907 --> 19:21.244
Better yet,
let's make him an honorary Goof!

19:21.327 --> 19:24.164
No, no! Uh, really, please!

19:24.247 --> 19:27.250

20:49.541 --> 20:51.876
Well, don't worry about a thing, Peg dear.

20:52.002 --> 20:53.962
Why, we couldn't think of letting

Pete break his bank account
fixing Goofy's house.

20:56.381 --> 20:58.133
Yeah, that wasn't his fault,

Goofy-style barn raising?

Only gonna cost Pete a tenth as much!
