00:45.253 --> 00:48.113
Oh! Here's a sight for sore eyes.

00:48.188 --> 00:50.018
Hello, Aunty Peg.

00:50.028 --> 00:52.658
Hello, love. Oh, my darling.

00:52.668 --> 00:55.448
I can't believe I'm actually here.

00:55.452 --> 00:57.292
I could pinch you if you like.

00:58.452 --> 01:00.092
Come in. Come in.

01:02.812 --> 01:04.441
Come on.

01:04.452 --> 01:06.012
You've come halfway round the world.

01:07.972 --> 01:09.492
One more step won't hurt.

01:12.492 --> 01:13.762
She's expecting me?

01:13.772 --> 01:16.347
Ah, she says
she doesn't want to see you,

01:16.357 --> 01:18.932
but not a day's gone by
since she wrote back

01:18.942 --> 01:20.732
that she hasn't mentioned you.

01:22.052 --> 01:26.132
She's, um...pretty much stayed
up there since it happened.

01:27.412 --> 01:29.092
Except for going to mass.

01:32.132 --> 01:33.492
Good luck, love.

01:36.932 --> 01:38.012
OK.

01:49.212 --> 01:50.212
Hello, Mother.

01:59.972 --> 02:02.332
She'll be different
when she comes out of the grief.

02:03.132 --> 02:04.132
No, she won't.

02:05.132 --> 02:07.372
You're the last of her babies, love.

02:07.382 --> 02:09.292
Now she wants me dead too.

02:11.412 --> 02:13.372
I should never have called you back.

02:14.532 --> 02:16.402
You had to.

02:16.412 --> 02:17.932
And I had to come.

02:19.332 --> 02:21.212
You've never done wrong by me, Peg.

02:22.572 --> 02:25.092
Tell me
I'm not going to lose you again.

02:27.212 --> 02:29.122
There's nothing for me in Europe.

02:29.132 --> 02:31.572
There must be something.
Not anymore.

02:35.732 --> 02:37.812
I hope you'll tell me about it
one day.

02:39.532 --> 02:41.812
I'll always let you know where I am.

02:41.822 --> 02:43.492
If Mum asks.
Of course.

02:43.502 --> 02:44.492
Bridget!

02:46.492 --> 02:47.732
Sarah.

02:50.172 --> 02:51.627
It's been 20 years, love.

02:51.637 --> 02:53.092
Where are you going to go?

03:56.452 --> 03:57.612
Mrs. Bligh?

04:02.092 --> 04:04.132
Mrs. Bligh. It's the nurse.

04:10.652 --> 04:12.132
Uh, Mrs. Bligh?

04:18.332 --> 04:20.127
Can I help you?
Oh!

04:20.137 --> 04:21.932
I'm here for Mrs. Bligh.

04:21.942 --> 04:23.572
The doctor sent me.

04:23.582 --> 04:24.572
I'm her son.

04:25.612 --> 04:27.932
She's not in her bed?
No.

04:35.772 --> 04:37.212
Don't give me that look, George.

04:37.222 --> 04:38.592
The air's doing me good.

04:38.602 --> 04:39.972
You agreed to bed rest.

04:41.932 --> 04:43.122
Your nurse is here.

04:43.132 --> 04:46.492
Well, she can come back later.
Thank you, nurse.

04:46.502 --> 04:49.492
You're quite welcome,
but it must be now.

04:49.502 --> 04:51.442
I have other patients.

04:51.452 --> 04:53.242
Your wrist, please.
What on earth are you doing?

04:53.252 --> 04:56.412
Taking your pulse and then I'll loosen
your blouse and listen to your heart.

04:56.422 --> 04:59.172
I have no intention
of exposing my chest in public.

04:59.182 --> 05:00.882
You insist on being here.

05:00.892 --> 05:03.012
Are you always so impertinent?

05:03.022 --> 05:04.892
I'm simply doing my job.

05:04.902 --> 05:05.892
So...

05:06.852 --> 05:07.852
Here or in private?

05:10.932 --> 05:12.762
There's a definite arrhythmia.

05:12.772 --> 05:16.967
Absolute rest in your suite
for at least a week.

05:16.977 --> 05:21.172
I'll visit twice a day,
and I'll be back at...4:00.

05:21.182 --> 05:23.652
I'm aglow with anticipation.

05:30.412 --> 05:33.532
Try to get her to understand
how potentially serious this is.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.722
Obedience has never been
Mother's forte.

05:35.732 --> 05:37.692
I've known generals to buckle
under her glare.

05:37.702 --> 05:39.442
They should have
used her in the war.

05:39.452 --> 05:41.427
Well, you know where I am
if you need anything.

05:41.437 --> 05:43.412
I'm sure I'll manage.
I have a feeling you will.

05:43.422 --> 05:44.612
I didn't catch your name.

05:44.622 --> 05:46.282
Adams.

05:46.292 --> 05:47.532
Sister Adams.

05:50.612 --> 05:52.002
Poor Father.

05:52.012 --> 05:54.532
Having to take dinner with Gran
every night.

05:54.542 --> 05:56.362
Is he so worried about her?

05:56.372 --> 05:59.082
Worried she'll get up to dance,
more like.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.572
Frankly I think he's just glad
to get out of the firing line.

06:02.972 --> 06:05.167
George Bligh on board
with nowhere to run?

06:05.177 --> 06:07.369
Those widows and spinsters
hunt him like game.

06:07.379 --> 06:09.572
Father's a handsome man.
Why shouldn't they?

06:09.582 --> 06:11.452
I doubt it's his looks
they're after.

06:12.532 --> 06:14.012
Leave that.

06:27.012 --> 06:28.612
I love this.

06:30.252 --> 06:32.522
Do you think we might dance?

06:32.532 --> 06:34.547
Shuffling around as a maudlin here?
No.

06:34.557 --> 06:36.572
Dance with your bride,
you old grump.

06:36.582 --> 06:38.252
I don't feel like it.

06:41.972 --> 06:43.727
Sorry...darling.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.492
I just don't.

06:48.412 --> 06:51.492
If he won't, Livvy, may I?

08:08.892 --> 08:09.892
Yes.

08:12.412 --> 08:13.962
Sister Adams.

08:13.972 --> 08:16.842
Oh, Mr. Bligh.
We dock in Sydney tomorrow.

08:16.852 --> 08:19.652
I just wanted to thank you
for all you've done.

08:21.812 --> 08:23.362
It's my job.

08:23.372 --> 08:25.367
Three weeks tending to my mother?

08:25.377 --> 08:27.329
I call that duty above and beyond.

08:27.339 --> 08:29.292
I've had more difficult patients.

08:30.492 --> 08:32.092
Not many.

08:33.652 --> 08:36.202
We would like to show you
our gratitude.

08:36.212 --> 08:38.412
Would you care to join us
for the last night dinner dance?

08:40.332 --> 08:41.761
Oh, I, um...
Please.

08:41.772 --> 08:43.282
Your mother...
I'm asking.

08:43.292 --> 08:45.812
I mean, I'd love to, but...
I've cleared it with Captain.

08:45.822 --> 08:47.722
I don't have
anything suitable to wear.

08:47.732 --> 08:50.692
I'm sure between Anne or Olivia
there's a gown you can borrow.

08:53.412 --> 08:55.492
So, we'll see you this evening?

08:57.532 --> 08:58.727
Yes.

08:58.737 --> 08:59.932
Good.

09:10.652 --> 09:13.572
Is it too much to expect
your guest of honour to be punctual?

09:13.582 --> 09:15.442
I'm sure there's a good reason.

09:15.452 --> 09:18.212
There's never a good reason
for bad manners.

09:24.612 --> 09:26.322
Is that one of your gowns?

09:26.332 --> 09:28.092
She didn't
have anything appropriate.

09:28.102 --> 09:29.932
And you found this out...?

09:29.942 --> 09:31.772
By actually talking to her.

09:31.782 --> 09:32.962
Sorry I'm late.

09:32.972 --> 09:34.852
Emergency sprained ankle.

09:36.172 --> 09:37.707
I told you
that was the right choice.

09:37.717 --> 09:39.252
You sure it's not too young for me?

09:39.262 --> 09:40.732
You look lovely.
Thank you.

09:40.742 --> 09:42.752
No, thank you.

09:42.762 --> 09:44.762
For everything.

09:44.772 --> 09:47.732
I'm sure I speak for all of us.

09:47.742 --> 09:49.092
A toast...

09:51.292 --> 09:52.732
..to Sister Adams.

09:54.372 --> 09:55.547
Mother?

09:55.557 --> 09:56.722
Indeed.

09:56.732 --> 09:58.932
And to tomorrow - to our homecoming.

10:01.052 --> 10:04.092
To Sister Adams
and our homecoming.

10:25.492 --> 10:27.282
Well, I'd best retire

10:27.292 --> 10:31.492
before Ms Adams feels compelled
to bark any final reproof.

10:31.502 --> 10:33.332
I wouldn't be so impertinent.

10:36.012 --> 10:38.772
I trust Australia is everything
you hope it will be.

10:38.782 --> 10:40.252
Thank you, Mrs. Bligh.

10:40.262 --> 10:41.592
Goodnight, darling.

10:41.602 --> 10:42.932
Goodnight, Grandma.

10:50.612 --> 10:53.012
Darling?
What?

10:53.022 --> 10:54.882
Nothing.

10:54.892 --> 10:56.532
You're being a bore.

10:59.212 --> 11:00.332
Miss Adams.

11:00.972 --> 11:03.612
How long
since you were last in Australia?

11:03.622 --> 11:05.562
A long time.

11:05.572 --> 11:07.572
Were you nursing in the war?

11:07.582 --> 11:09.202
No.
Why not?

11:09.212 --> 11:11.007
What are you, the Inquisition?

11:11.017 --> 11:12.812
She's just making conversation.

11:12.822 --> 11:14.292
It's none of our business.

11:17.132 --> 11:18.132
Sorry.

11:20.972 --> 11:22.372
No more for you.

11:27.892 --> 11:29.762
Sister Adams.

11:29.772 --> 11:31.372
Would you care to dance?

11:33.452 --> 11:34.812
Why, thank you.

11:38.412 --> 11:42.252
I should warn you, it's been
a long time between dances.

11:43.812 --> 11:45.642
Sir?

11:45.652 --> 11:47.547
He doesn't need it.

11:47.557 --> 11:49.452
I'm not a bloody child.

11:57.372 --> 11:58.372
Livvy.

12:11.692 --> 12:13.652
You're not rusty.

12:16.092 --> 12:17.762
What?

12:17.772 --> 12:21.292
This isn't a situation
I expected to find myself in.

12:22.252 --> 12:23.532
I hope that's a good thing.

12:36.972 --> 12:39.652
Can I ask what brings you home
to Australia?

12:39.662 --> 12:41.092
Back to Australia.

12:42.172 --> 12:43.412
Is there a reason?

12:45.812 --> 12:48.467
My half-brother died
fighting in Korea.

12:48.477 --> 12:51.132
I'm my mother's
only surviving child.

12:51.142 --> 12:52.772
I'm sorry to hear that.

12:53.812 --> 12:57.052
The role of a dutiful child
is a hard one.

12:57.062 --> 12:59.012
I lost that title a long time ago.

13:02.012 --> 13:03.987
We haven't spoken for 20 years.

13:03.997 --> 13:05.972
I'm not even sure she'll see me.

13:07.932 --> 13:09.252
Why did you fall out?

13:14.572 --> 13:16.132
You don't have to answer that.

13:51.972 --> 13:53.492
This is me.

13:55.612 --> 13:56.612
Thank you.

14:00.092 --> 14:01.652
For everything.

14:02.732 --> 14:05.212
If for any reason
it doesn't work out in Sydney,

14:05.222 --> 14:06.732
we have a hospital in Inverness.

14:07.972 --> 14:10.002
I know there's a position
they're trying to fill.

14:10.012 --> 14:14.452
That's very kind, but some
obligations can't be passed on.

14:24.292 --> 14:27.172
I wish I hadn't left our talk
to the last night.

15:05.732 --> 15:07.612
James, come away from there.

15:09.052 --> 15:10.652
It's slippery. Come on.

15:11.972 --> 15:13.812
Wasn't doing anything.
Then come back.

15:15.652 --> 15:16.892
No-one needs to know.

15:18.212 --> 15:19.612
Tell them I'm sorry.

15:28.372 --> 15:30.212
James. No!

15:40.052 --> 15:41.932
I just can't do it.

15:52.049 --> 15:53.944
Hold that around you.

15:53.955 --> 15:55.549
I'll get the doctor.

15:55.559 --> 15:56.939
No.

15:56.949 --> 15:58.429
It's my job. I have to.

15:58.439 --> 15:59.579
No... Um...

15:59.589 --> 16:01.349
No-one can know. I'll be fine.
I'll stay with you.

16:01.359 --> 16:03.709
At the very least,
your father must know.

16:03.719 --> 16:04.739
No.

16:04.749 --> 16:06.509
You just tried to kill yourself.

16:06.519 --> 16:07.699
I didn't...

16:07.709 --> 16:08.869
I didn't mean it.

16:14.549 --> 16:15.989
Alright. Just...

16:16.909 --> 16:17.909
Not him.

16:20.589 --> 16:21.819
Thank you.
Ma'am.

16:21.829 --> 16:22.819
What on earth is going on?

16:22.829 --> 16:26.029
I didn't want to bring you into this,
Mrs. Bligh, but I have to tell someone.

16:26.039 --> 16:28.509
My heart is fine.
And James insisted it be you.

16:29.589 --> 16:30.819
What's he done?

16:30.829 --> 16:33.149
He tried to jump overboard.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.219
That's ridiculous.

16:34.229 --> 16:36.509
He tried to kill himself.
I was there.

16:37.869 --> 16:39.789
Who knows?
No-one.

16:39.799 --> 16:40.859
Only me.

16:40.869 --> 16:42.419
I've given him something
to settle him,

16:42.429 --> 16:46.149
but he needs to be watched carefully
for quite some time.

16:58.389 --> 16:59.429
I'm sorry.

17:14.029 --> 17:15.704
Did you tell her?

17:15.714 --> 17:17.378
She saw.
N...

17:17.388 --> 17:19.989
Did you tell her why you did this?

17:26.469 --> 17:28.069
I want you to listen to me.

17:29.229 --> 17:30.789
Listen to me.

17:32.829 --> 17:38.629
I know that right now you feel
you'll never be happy again.

17:40.509 --> 17:41.869
I know you're hurt.

17:43.389 --> 17:46.179
But no-one escapes suffering, James.

17:46.189 --> 17:49.349
You're behaving as if you're
the only who's ever experienced it.

17:50.189 --> 17:51.459
That's not fair.

17:51.469 --> 17:53.229
It's not bloody fair!

17:53.949 --> 17:55.939
That's enough.

17:55.949 --> 17:58.659
You have a privileged life.

17:58.669 --> 18:01.349
The price it demands
is respect for it.

18:03.789 --> 18:07.589
Your pain is real,
but so is your duty

18:07.599 --> 18:09.469
to your family and to yourself.

18:09.479 --> 18:10.629
Do you understand?

18:15.389 --> 18:17.909
I love you more than you know.

18:19.269 --> 18:22.789
But it is time
you learned life is unforgiving.

18:25.069 --> 18:27.069
It doesn't often give
a second chance.

18:27.079 --> 18:28.709
You found yourself with one.

18:29.789 --> 18:31.629
I hope to God you use it well.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.229
Thank you for your help.

18:45.669 --> 18:47.149
And for your discretion.

18:48.589 --> 18:49.869
I have it in hand.

18:50.949 --> 18:52.909
It's not my business
why he did this.

18:54.189 --> 18:57.149
But it is my business
to know he'll receive care.

18:57.159 --> 18:59.109
Do you imagine I won't care for him?

18:59.119 --> 19:00.099
No.

19:00.109 --> 19:02.149
Then there's no reason
for you to stay.

19:03.109 --> 19:05.109
No-one else is to know about this.

19:05.119 --> 19:06.429
No-one.

19:09.109 --> 19:11.669
I wish you all the best
for your future,

19:11.679 --> 19:13.269
wherever that may be.

19:54.272 --> 19:55.592
Hello, Mother.

20:00.232 --> 20:02.352
I don't know why you came.
You weren't asked to.

20:02.362 --> 20:04.472
I came because I'm your daughter.

20:07.432 --> 20:10.552
I know what it's like to be alone,
and I don't want that for you.

20:12.352 --> 20:13.752
And because I'm sorry.

20:16.038 --> 20:17.413
For what?

20:17.423 --> 20:18.798
Your loss.

20:20.198 --> 20:23.158
But not for abandoning your family
and all your church?

20:23.168 --> 20:24.148
Your God?

20:24.158 --> 20:25.798
I didn't come to air old grievances.

20:27.078 --> 20:28.158
Then you'll come back.

20:30.078 --> 20:32.598
Everything I own
is in two bags downstairs.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.428
Not just to me.

20:36.438 --> 20:38.708
My child is God's child.

20:38.718 --> 20:40.518
Are you going to
be my daughter again?

20:40.528 --> 20:41.678
Please don't ask me that.

20:42.958 --> 20:45.238
I suppose you want me
to call you Sarah?

20:45.248 --> 20:46.788
That's my name now.

20:46.798 --> 20:48.238
Why don't you just leave?

20:49.958 --> 20:52.838
I have come halfway around the world
for you. I'm not giving up that easily.

20:53.998 --> 20:56.238
Then we'll go to the church,
and you'll go on your knees

20:56.248 --> 20:58.218
and ask Him for forgiveness
for what you've done.

20:58.228 --> 21:00.198
You'll repent,
and I'll forgive you everything.

21:00.208 --> 21:02.038
Every wrong.
You can do that now.

21:03.598 --> 21:07.598
Let Him into your heart again.
Then I can love you.

21:09.638 --> 21:10.998
This isn't about the church.

21:11.008 --> 21:12.988
I'm your child.

21:12.998 --> 21:15.078
You come here in my mourning
to make me weak.

21:15.088 --> 21:16.508
Well, I'm not.

21:16.518 --> 21:18.238
I won't let you put my heart
underfoot again.

21:18.248 --> 21:19.228
Do you hear me?
Mum.

21:19.238 --> 21:20.973
I didn't ask you to come.
Please.

21:20.983 --> 21:22.718
Your aunty
should never have written.

21:22.728 --> 21:24.718
Come with me now.

21:24.728 --> 21:26.718
I can't.
Then go.

21:26.728 --> 21:27.868
No.

21:27.878 --> 21:29.798
Take your Jew name and go.

21:29.808 --> 21:30.958
I have no daughter.

21:32.238 --> 21:33.238
Go!

21:41.358 --> 21:44.398
It's been 20 years, love.
Where are you going to go?

22:39.398 --> 22:41.358
That church is an ice box.

22:41.368 --> 22:42.428
Good sermon.

22:42.438 --> 22:44.308
You slept through it.
Precisely.

22:44.318 --> 22:45.868
What time do you want me
at the station, sir?

22:45.878 --> 22:48.158
Just leave the car out, Norman.
I'll collect Miss Adams.

22:48.168 --> 22:49.228
Is that necessary?

22:49.238 --> 22:50.918
She'll be glad to see
a friendly face.

22:51.878 --> 22:53.518
Are we talking about Sarah?

22:53.528 --> 22:55.148
Sister Adams, yes.

22:55.158 --> 22:56.733
I'll take that, ma'am.
Oh. Thank you, Amy.

22:56.743 --> 22:58.318
You should bring Sarah back
for lunch.

22:59.718 --> 23:00.868
I'll see how she's feeling.

23:00.878 --> 23:03.078
I'm sure she'll be
far too tired for that.

23:03.088 --> 23:04.158
Another time.

23:04.168 --> 23:05.388
Perhaps.

23:05.398 --> 23:07.598
Anyone would think
you didn't want her here.

23:07.608 --> 23:08.788
How's Miss Olivia?

23:08.798 --> 23:11.078
- She barely touched her breakfast.
- Oh, James.

23:11.088 --> 23:12.198
That girl will fade away.

23:12.208 --> 23:13.228
I'll check on her.

23:13.238 --> 23:15.238
Yeah, please. And get her to eat.

23:15.248 --> 23:16.878
Mmm. Listless.

23:16.888 --> 23:18.228
Nausea.

23:18.238 --> 23:20.148
Lack of appetite.

23:20.158 --> 23:22.718
Perhaps James
has done his family duty?

23:37.078 --> 23:38.238
How was the sermon?

23:38.248 --> 23:39.558
Terminal.

23:42.798 --> 23:43.838
How are you?

23:44.998 --> 23:46.478
All aches and pains.

23:49.078 --> 23:50.238
You're hot.

23:52.638 --> 23:53.918
Think I will call the doctor.

23:54.998 --> 23:56.158
I'll be fine.

23:58.518 --> 23:59.598
Thank you.

24:00.598 --> 24:01.588
For what?

24:01.598 --> 24:03.998
You've been so wonderful
since we docked.

24:05.198 --> 24:07.158
On the boat...
Forget the boat.

24:08.118 --> 24:09.958
..I thought you wished
you'd never married me.

24:11.638 --> 24:12.838
Don't be silly.

24:19.718 --> 24:21.558
I will call Jack Duncan.

24:23.038 --> 24:24.358
Just to be sure.

24:43.598 --> 24:44.958
You need to rest.

24:49.398 --> 24:51.118
I love you, James.

24:53.598 --> 24:54.918
I know you do.

25:12.758 --> 25:14.473
I can't thank you enough for this.

25:14.483 --> 25:16.198
I was glad to receive your letter.

25:17.838 --> 25:19.478
The hospital
will be lucky to have you.

25:19.488 --> 25:20.958
Oh, if they want me, that is.

25:20.968 --> 25:22.438
Jack is a good doctor.

25:22.448 --> 25:23.508
And a good man.

25:23.518 --> 25:26.158
I'm sure you'll impress him
as much as you did us.

25:30.278 --> 25:31.558
How's your mother's health?

25:32.198 --> 25:33.718
The specialist ordered more rest...

25:35.118 --> 25:36.598
..and some changes to diet.

25:40.718 --> 25:42.318
And your mother?

25:59.958 --> 26:01.493
The guest cottage.

26:01.503 --> 26:03.038
Small but comfortable.

26:03.048 --> 26:04.398
It's wonderful.

26:06.438 --> 26:09.238
Get down, boy. Shoo!

26:11.358 --> 26:14.038
He latched onto one of our visitors.
Now we can't get rid of him.

26:15.958 --> 26:17.468
It's alright. He IS harmless.

26:17.478 --> 26:19.318
It's fine.
Are you frightened of dogs?

26:20.718 --> 26:22.588
I'll have him removed.
No, please.

26:22.598 --> 26:25.998
He was here first. He was just
protecting what he thinks is his.

26:26.008 --> 26:28.398
Well, he'd better get used to it
being yours.

26:28.408 --> 26:30.518
It is for as long as you'd like it.

26:30.528 --> 26:32.628
Thank you. This is all so generous.

26:32.638 --> 26:34.998
Oh, it's my pleasure.
Now for the tour.

26:36.758 --> 26:38.758
I owe you more than evasions.

26:40.678 --> 26:43.158
It didn't go at all well in Sydney
with my mother.

26:44.158 --> 26:46.878
And, yes,
I've had bad experiences with dogs.

26:48.078 --> 26:49.868
Does it have a name?

26:49.878 --> 26:51.638
All he gets from us is Boy.

26:53.998 --> 26:55.238
After you.

27:04.198 --> 27:05.438
Olivia won't be coming down.

27:05.448 --> 27:06.508
Oh. And Anna?

27:06.518 --> 27:08.193
Taken a turn, I think.

27:08.203 --> 27:09.878
Close the doors, will you?

27:17.958 --> 27:21.678
After Jack's done with Olivia
tonight, I wish to see him.

27:21.688 --> 27:22.718
Why?

27:24.558 --> 27:27.318
I don't want him employing
the Adams woman.

27:27.328 --> 27:29.388
She said she'd be discreet.

27:29.398 --> 27:32.638
And you're happy
to wager our future on that?

27:32.648 --> 27:34.118
She's a woman of her word.

27:35.398 --> 27:37.268
She's a good person.

27:37.278 --> 27:40.393
And how long before
this goodness you so admire

27:40.403 --> 27:43.518
obligates her to tell your father
what she knows?

27:44.838 --> 27:48.038
Are you prepared to answer
his inevitable questions...

27:48.048 --> 27:50.358
...about why you tried
to kill yourself?

27:50.368 --> 27:52.318
Because he will want to know.

27:55.598 --> 27:56.758
It's not fair.

27:57.518 --> 27:58.638
No, it's not.

28:00.118 --> 28:02.078
But you've given me no choice,
have you?

28:45.358 --> 28:48.558
If I'm slamming the door
in someone's face, Elizabeth,

28:48.568 --> 28:50.798
I'd sort of like to know why.

28:50.808 --> 28:52.628
George talked her up.

28:52.638 --> 28:54.798
Well, George is simply
playing good Samaritan

28:54.808 --> 28:56.748
to a woman he hardly knows.

28:56.758 --> 28:58.518
I saw a lot more of her than he did.

28:58.528 --> 28:59.748
And?

28:59.758 --> 29:02.198
She has
a sort of bland efficiency.

29:03.318 --> 29:05.788
Regardless,
she's returned to Australia

29:05.798 --> 29:08.533
out of some familial obligation
that's gone awry.

29:08.543 --> 29:11.278
She simply wants to earn enough
for her fare home.

29:11.288 --> 29:12.788
You know that for sure?

29:12.798 --> 29:15.838
Well, she contacted George
because she has no other options

29:15.848 --> 29:17.348
and no means.

29:17.358 --> 29:19.148
She will scuttle off
as soon as possible

29:19.158 --> 29:21.638
and you will just have to train
someone all over again.

29:22.838 --> 29:24.233
Now...

29:24.243 --> 29:25.638
..Olivia.

29:26.646 --> 29:27.996
There's nothing to worry about.

29:28.006 --> 29:30.446
Is it possible
the succession may be secure?

29:35.006 --> 29:37.436
If she's pregnant...

29:37.446 --> 29:39.276
..you'll be the second to know.

29:39.286 --> 29:42.766
From my mouth to their ears,
and then to yours.

29:46.126 --> 29:47.636
I've got to go.

29:47.646 --> 29:48.846
One more thought, Jack.

29:49.966 --> 29:52.676
The Adams woman
was 20 years in Europe.

29:52.686 --> 29:55.126
A town like Inverness
is not going to satisfy her.

29:56.126 --> 29:58.486
Employ someone
who might conceivably settle.

30:01.286 --> 30:02.726
Let's see how we go.

30:30.647 --> 30:32.447
I was coming over to see you.

30:34.247 --> 30:35.487
Here I am.

30:36.367 --> 30:38.087
Here I am.

30:42.727 --> 30:44.637
You docked a week ago.

30:44.647 --> 30:47.807
We had to stay in the city
for Grandmother to see a specialist.

30:47.817 --> 30:49.887
At least I got to see Aunty Carolyn.

30:51.367 --> 30:52.727
You'd rather see her than me?

30:53.887 --> 30:54.967
Don't sulk!

30:56.167 --> 30:58.727
Even if it does make you cute.

30:58.737 --> 31:00.767
Does it?
Very.

31:02.647 --> 31:04.127
Then I'll sulk.

31:06.927 --> 31:08.562
Papa saw you yesterday.

31:08.572 --> 31:10.207
We got back Saturday night.

31:11.007 --> 31:13.847
I was dragged to church
and I couldn't get away all day.

31:16.167 --> 31:19.087
This is the first chance, honestly.

31:20.527 --> 31:21.807
You think it isn't?

31:23.727 --> 31:24.927
I missed you.

31:26.167 --> 31:27.607
I missed you too.

31:33.647 --> 31:35.447
I worried.

31:35.457 --> 31:36.717
Why?

31:36.727 --> 31:38.927
There are many men in Europe.

31:38.937 --> 31:40.247
And you're here.

32:04.247 --> 32:07.167
Father had something come up.
He asked me to drive you.

32:07.177 --> 32:08.647
What a lovely surprise.

32:10.167 --> 32:11.647
Chance to say thank you again.

32:11.657 --> 32:13.047
No thanks are needed.

32:14.527 --> 32:15.842
How have you been?

32:15.852 --> 32:17.167
Well. Yourself?

32:20.167 --> 32:23.277
Really...how are you?

32:23.287 --> 32:26.637
Um, I'm doing better, I suppose.

32:26.647 --> 32:28.717
Are you getting
any professional help?

32:28.727 --> 32:30.887
I have Grandmother.
And she has a heart condition.

32:30.897 --> 32:32.527
There are people
trained to deal with...

32:32.537 --> 32:33.947
I'm fine.

32:33.957 --> 32:35.367
Shall we?

32:50.807 --> 32:53.287
Call the house and Norman
will collect you when you're done.

32:53.297 --> 32:55.247
Oh, I don't want to be a bother.

32:55.257 --> 32:56.327
It's his job.

32:57.447 --> 32:59.487
Good luck.
Thank you.

33:01.167 --> 33:03.567
James, if...if you do need to talk,
I'm here.

33:04.887 --> 33:07.127
And hopefully will be
for a long while.

33:13.647 --> 33:14.927
Right.

33:16.807 --> 33:18.887
You've had an interesting
and impressive career.

33:18.897 --> 33:21.167
You sound surprised.

33:21.177 --> 33:23.447
1937, Spanish Civil War.

33:25.247 --> 33:26.527
Must have been rough nursing.

33:26.537 --> 33:28.207
Any war zone is.

33:30.287 --> 33:32.727
'39 to '46, there's nothing.

33:34.167 --> 33:36.247
You didn't work during the big one?
I wasn't able to.

33:36.257 --> 33:37.517
Why?

33:37.527 --> 33:39.807
I'm sorry.
I don't see the relevance.

33:39.817 --> 33:41.727
Well, it's work history.

33:41.737 --> 33:42.717
It's relevant.

33:42.727 --> 33:44.447
But as you pointed out,
I wasn't working,

33:44.457 --> 33:45.967
which makes it personal history.

33:46.967 --> 33:49.887
I assumed I'd be hired
for my skills, not my story.

33:49.897 --> 33:52.207
Is that why you left out
your religion?

33:53.527 --> 33:56.407
'Cause I have no issue with
atheists, if that's the concern.

33:57.527 --> 33:59.527
But prayers are said
twice a day here.

33:59.537 --> 34:00.887
Would that be a problem for you?

34:00.897 --> 34:02.447
It hasn't been so far.

34:03.647 --> 34:05.807
But I'm not an atheist. I'm Jewish.

34:05.817 --> 34:07.127
By faith.

34:08.367 --> 34:09.726
You converted?

34:14.806 --> 34:15.877
Well.

34:15.887 --> 34:18.242
I'll say my prayers
while you say yours.

34:18.252 --> 34:20.607
Would that be a problem for you,
Dr. Duncan?

34:25.167 --> 34:26.407
Fair enough.

34:29.367 --> 34:31.641
The position is for someone
to nurse in the community,

34:31.652 --> 34:33.927
so you'd spend most of your time
making house calls.

34:35.007 --> 34:37.567
If I'm gonna see how you work,
we should find you a patient.

34:40.246 --> 34:41.407
Lead the way.

35:19.007 --> 35:21.007
Roy! You there?

35:25.247 --> 35:26.487
Roy!

35:30.647 --> 35:32.262
Turn around. Go on!

35:32.272 --> 35:33.887
Don't be like that.

35:34.967 --> 35:36.462
This is Miss Adams.

35:36.472 --> 35:37.967
She's looking for work.

35:39.367 --> 35:40.517
Thought we could say g'day.

35:40.527 --> 35:43.087
No, you thought you'd come
and poke around my ruddy leg again,

35:43.097 --> 35:44.887
and I won't have it, so go on, git!

35:44.897 --> 35:46.157
Roy had an accident.

35:46.167 --> 35:47.877
He came in and we operated.

35:47.887 --> 35:50.807
But now he won't let us
keep the wound treated.

35:50.817 --> 35:53.007
You done your job.
You stitched me up.

35:53.017 --> 35:54.237
Now bugger off.

35:54.247 --> 35:57.767
The big risk is blood poisoning.
It can be lethal, Roy.

36:00.447 --> 36:02.087
What do you think, Sister?

36:07.327 --> 36:08.687
Where do you think you're goin'?

36:10.247 --> 36:11.637
You have two choices.

36:11.647 --> 36:15.407
Either you shoot me or you come inside and
let me do what I must to keep you healthy.

36:23.807 --> 36:25.837
I'd normally work unsupervised, yes?

36:25.847 --> 36:27.887
How will I know
if you've done a good job?

36:29.007 --> 36:30.447
You won't hear a gunshot.

36:43.938 --> 36:46.193
He'd have me
at that bloody hospital every day.

36:46.203 --> 36:48.458
I've got a farm to run.
You can tell him that.

36:50.738 --> 36:51.958
Well?

36:51.999 --> 36:53.469
It does need treatment.

36:53.479 --> 36:55.509
Yeah, go on...
Hear me out!

36:55.519 --> 36:57.819
It's clear you don't like the doctor

36:57.858 --> 36:59.888
and it's just as clear
he doesn't like me

36:59.898 --> 37:02.098
or he wouldn't have brought me
to be held at gunpoint

37:02.108 --> 37:03.888
during a job interview.

37:03.898 --> 37:06.298
So, do me a favour -
let me dress the wound.

37:07.298 --> 37:09.338
It'll save your leg
and your farm with it.

37:11.178 --> 37:14.858
It'll also give Dr. Duncan
a nice big serving of crow.

37:17.218 --> 37:18.458
What do you say?

37:22.538 --> 37:23.818
Struth, missy.

37:24.818 --> 37:26.498
Yeah, righto. You do your worst.

37:32.098 --> 37:33.808
Well?

37:33.818 --> 37:35.818
Thanks for the gift, Roy.

37:36.738 --> 37:38.168
I'll see you next week, then.

37:38.178 --> 37:40.178
I imagine that's up to Dr. Duncan.

37:44.178 --> 37:46.593
Now, you'd be a fool
to let that one go,

37:46.603 --> 37:49.018
but I s'pose that means
you probably will.

38:00.498 --> 38:02.008
How did you manage that?

38:02.018 --> 38:05.578
It was quite easy, really, once
we learned we had shared opinions.

38:05.588 --> 38:07.928
On?
You.

38:07.938 --> 38:10.368
You think I'm being unfair.

38:10.378 --> 38:12.693
Devoid of humour or charm perhaps,

38:12.703 --> 38:14.735
but unfair implies you had an agenda

38:14.745 --> 38:16.778
and I can't imagine
a reason you would.

38:25.178 --> 38:28.618
If I was harder than I needed to be,
I'm sorry.

38:28.628 --> 38:30.728
It wasn't personal.

38:30.738 --> 38:32.368
Apology accepted.
Good.

38:32.378 --> 38:34.458
The job is yours, if you want it.

38:36.858 --> 38:38.978
Are you offering because
George Bligh insisted you do?

38:38.988 --> 38:40.248
No.

38:40.258 --> 38:42.818
I'm offering
because we'd be lucky to have you.

38:45.178 --> 38:46.288
You're more than qualified.

38:46.298 --> 38:50.498
You obviously know how to deal with
people, even the charmless ones.

38:56.818 --> 38:59.698
Well, I won't rush you
for a decision, but...

39:01.818 --> 39:03.458
..the job is yours if you want it.

39:26.738 --> 39:29.538
I thought you might need supplies.
Let me know if you run out.

39:30.538 --> 39:32.898
Thank you, Mr. Bligh,
but I'm not sure I'll be staying.

39:34.738 --> 39:36.218
The interview didn't go well?

39:36.228 --> 39:37.698
The job was offered.

39:38.658 --> 39:39.858
Then what?

39:41.618 --> 39:44.978
Dr. Duncan started with
a definite bias against me.

39:46.658 --> 39:47.978
That IS surprising.

39:48.938 --> 39:50.413
Jack's a fair man.

39:50.423 --> 39:51.888
But it was there...

39:51.898 --> 39:53.858
..and I'd rather not work
where I'm not wanted.

39:58.738 --> 40:00.978
Well, I do hope
you consider the offer...

40:02.098 --> 40:04.058
..despite your misgivings.

40:08.098 --> 40:09.273
Goodnight.

40:09.283 --> 40:10.458
Goodnight.

40:14.698 --> 40:16.738
You see, you'd have at least
one supporter.

40:19.938 --> 40:21.818
Make that two.

41:03.098 --> 41:05.458
I thought I made my wishes clear.

41:05.468 --> 41:07.978
No, you misrepresented her.

41:09.458 --> 41:11.778
She's a lot more
than blandly efficient.

41:12.938 --> 41:14.913
I don't understand
your problem with her.

41:14.923 --> 41:16.898
Well, it should be enough
that I have one.

41:17.938 --> 41:20.538
Come on, you give me one good reason
and I'll retract the offer.

41:20.548 --> 41:24.298
The fact that I want it
should suffice.

41:24.308 --> 41:26.178
Not this time.

41:34.658 --> 41:36.898
The guest cottage, please, Norman.

42:12.091 --> 42:13.891
Nurse Adams.

42:19.458 --> 42:22.818
So, you're comfortable.
Well-supplied, I see.

42:23.106 --> 42:24.986
Thanks to Mr. Bligh.

42:25.706 --> 42:26.936
With milk, thank you.

42:26.946 --> 42:30.706
No sugar -
a dictate of my specialist.

42:32.626 --> 42:34.146
Yes, George is very generous.

42:37.026 --> 42:39.986
It's a generosity - thank you -
I'd also like to extend.

42:41.946 --> 42:43.626
You helped my grandson.

42:44.906 --> 42:46.146
For that I'm in your debt.

42:48.106 --> 42:49.616
So, as a sign of my gratitude,

42:49.626 --> 42:53.186
I would like to pay
your return passage to England.

42:56.386 --> 42:58.146
That's incredibly kind.

43:00.106 --> 43:02.896
I understand the importance of home.

43:02.906 --> 43:05.626
Clearly your family matters
did not go well.

43:09.826 --> 43:12.401
Being here with no-one
must be difficult.

43:12.411 --> 43:14.986
In England...
Did you speak to Dr. Duncan?

43:16.226 --> 43:18.146
Did you encourage him against me?

43:18.706 --> 43:19.786
Yes.

43:21.066 --> 43:22.881
I'm sure you're a good person.

43:22.891 --> 43:24.696
You say you can keep your word...

43:24.706 --> 43:27.546
Then that's all this is -
your fear I'll talk about James.

43:27.556 --> 43:29.656
Frankly, yes.

43:29.666 --> 43:33.226
That is a very generous offer.
You would be a fool not to accept.

43:33.236 --> 43:34.786
And you'd be a fool
to think I would.

43:40.466 --> 43:42.506
Perhaps a larger sum.

43:43.226 --> 43:45.266
I won't be bought, Mrs. Bligh.

43:46.666 --> 43:49.546
I've been told what to do before.
I've been forced.

43:51.146 --> 43:53.066
And I promised myself never again.

43:54.786 --> 43:56.906
Thank you for helping me
make up my mind.

43:58.266 --> 44:00.136
You'd stay just to spite me?

44:00.146 --> 44:02.346
I'll stay because my choices
are mine, not yours.

44:11.426 --> 44:12.706
Then we shall see.

44:13.706 --> 44:14.855
We shall.
