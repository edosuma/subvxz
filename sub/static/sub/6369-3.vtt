00:13.081 --> 00:14.582
Thom:
This is God.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.384
God can do anything,

00:16.417 --> 00:18.052
but there's one thing
He can't do.

00:18.086 --> 00:21.055
Not now, not ever.
God can't die.

00:21.089 --> 00:23.791
God is eternal, you see?
God has to be eternal.

00:23.824 --> 00:25.659
That's the whole idea
of God.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.661
So the moment God can die,
He's no longer God,

00:27.695 --> 00:29.730
and so God
should shut the fuck up.

00:29.763 --> 00:32.466
Walk a mile in my terrified
mortal shoes, God.

00:32.500 --> 00:36.204
Lie in the dark,
knowing nothing of the dark
eternal nothing that follows.

00:36.237 --> 00:37.471
Then you can judge me.

00:37.505 --> 00:40.074
Until then, fuck off.
Fuck you, God.

00:40.108 --> 00:43.411
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

00:43.444 --> 00:46.147
* If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands *

00:46.180 --> 00:48.682
* If you're
happy and you know it,
then motherfucking show it *

00:48.716 --> 00:51.552
* If you're happy
and you know it, clap your
motherfucking hands *

00:51.585 --> 00:55.223
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands! *

00:55.256 --> 00:57.625
( Julius coughing )

01:02.230 --> 01:04.232
( groans )

01:04.265 --> 01:06.100
( coughing continues )

01:06.134 --> 01:08.569
( whines )

01:08.602 --> 01:12.173
- ( coughing continues )
- ( sighs )

01:12.206 --> 01:14.375
Stop it.

01:14.408 --> 01:15.776
Stop what?

01:15.809 --> 01:19.113
Picturing him dead.
It's a bug.

01:19.147 --> 01:22.516
- I'm not picturing him dead.
- Yes, you are.

01:22.550 --> 01:25.119
I'm picturing him dying.

01:25.153 --> 01:27.321
Mm, much better.

01:27.355 --> 01:29.790
Dying's worse than death.

01:29.823 --> 01:32.193
Once you're dead,
it's over.

01:32.226 --> 01:36.764
If you're dying,
you're still hoping
you'll pull through.

01:38.299 --> 01:40.201
Which, of course,
you won't.

01:40.234 --> 01:44.138
It's-- it's the hope
that causes the pain.

01:44.172 --> 01:49.243
Well, whichever is
more agonizing for you, dear.

01:50.311 --> 01:51.612
Hmm.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.681
Come on,
you can't fire Larry.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.549
He's just had a baby.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.218
Larry's kid is in college.

01:57.251 --> 01:59.387
But he's got baby photographs
all over his office.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.222
They're stock photos.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.424
He puts them up
so we don't fire him.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.226
That's genius.

02:05.259 --> 02:07.361
I mean,
do you want to fire
that kind of genius?

02:07.395 --> 02:09.830
- I don't want
to fire anybody.
- What about Debbie?

02:09.863 --> 02:11.899
You're head
of Production, David.
Debbie's an AE.

02:11.932 --> 02:14.502
Why don't you offer up
someone from your own
fucking department?

02:14.535 --> 02:15.903
Debbie's been around
a long time, Jon.

02:15.936 --> 02:18.539
- 20 years.
- That's the point.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.708
That's two years' severance.
It'd be cheaper to keep her
than to fire her.

02:20.741 --> 02:25.913
Guys, we're creating
a better and smarter MGT.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.448
Every act of creation

02:27.481 --> 02:31.452
is an act
of destruction.

02:31.485 --> 02:34.622
Gustaff reminds us
of eggs and omelets.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.427
- What about Michael?
- We're not firing Michael.

02:39.460 --> 02:40.794
He's a pain
in the ass, Thom.

02:40.828 --> 02:43.264
All good people
are a pain in the ass, David.

02:43.297 --> 02:44.932
Stick to your own
Goddamn department.

02:44.965 --> 02:46.967
- I can drop Vince.
- We can't drop Vince.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.537
- Because he's black?
- 'Cause no one else is.

02:49.570 --> 02:53.407
Look, nobody gets
to play Jesus on this one.

02:53.441 --> 02:54.675
Every soul you save today

02:54.708 --> 02:56.610
is another soul
you condemn tomorrow,

02:56.644 --> 02:58.346
so climb down
off your crosses,

02:58.379 --> 02:59.480
take off
your thorned crowns,

02:59.513 --> 03:00.681
and make
the difficult decisions

03:00.714 --> 03:03.484
you guys get paid
to make.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.686
We're gonna start
with Larry.

03:05.719 --> 03:06.987
I'm gonna think
about Debbie.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.957
Maya, I need four
from your department total.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.360
David, I need
two from yours.

03:12.393 --> 03:13.561
Why does
the Planning Department

03:13.594 --> 03:15.296
need to lose twice
as many as Production?

03:15.329 --> 03:17.431
Account is losing 14.

03:17.465 --> 03:20.534
You're welcome to stay
for the next meeting
if you want.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.338
Hey, guys.
Come on in.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.708
I need a caffeine enema.
( laughs )

03:27.741 --> 03:29.510
No, I'm not kidding you.
I'm so freakin' tired.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.645
- * Mother is called madre... *
- What did you guys do?

03:31.679 --> 03:33.981
- * Papá is your dad... *
- Lee: Oh, no.

03:34.014 --> 03:36.517
Dude, Jennifer's
got that bug now.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.486
She's not going
to school today.

03:38.519 --> 03:40.988
Well, yeah, last night
was really rough, but I think
we're over the hump.

03:41.021 --> 03:43.257
His fever's gone.
You know what's amazing?

03:43.291 --> 03:46.327
- What fluids and rest
will do for you.
- Mom?

03:46.360 --> 03:49.497
No, let the body do
its thang, you know.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.932
It's like fresh air.

03:51.965 --> 03:54.502
It's gonna do more for you
than any fuckin' doctor.

03:54.535 --> 03:57.338
- Mom.
- Honey, I'm on the phone.

03:57.371 --> 04:01.275
- ( vomiting continues )
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

04:01.309 --> 04:04.412
Buddy. Oh, no.

04:04.445 --> 04:07.781
Oh, that feels not fun.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.885
Didn't Razorfish
just lose Microsoft?

04:11.919 --> 04:13.654
They went to IPG in May

04:13.687 --> 04:15.756
and they already have
a creative director.

04:15.789 --> 04:18.392
Yeah, I'm thinking
account executive.

04:18.426 --> 04:20.694
Oh, you're gonna move
to the account side now?

04:20.728 --> 04:21.929
Not for me, for Debbie.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.697
I mean, do you know
anyone there?

04:23.731 --> 04:25.399
Can you just see
if they're looking?

04:25.433 --> 04:27.401
- Is she?
- She might be.

04:27.435 --> 04:29.770
- Bad?
- Might be.

04:29.803 --> 04:32.072
You know, Thom, you have
your own job to worry about.

04:32.105 --> 04:35.543
Well, I-- I can worry
about many things.

04:35.576 --> 04:37.911
You know,
I can multi-worry.

04:37.945 --> 04:40.381
You know the only business
worse than advertising?

04:40.414 --> 04:42.416
It's the messiah business.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.951
Go. The pay is lousy,

04:43.984 --> 04:46.053
the only benefit
is self-congratulations,

04:46.086 --> 04:48.389
and the saved don't
stay saved very long.

04:48.422 --> 04:50.791
Trust me,
it's the foundation
of my entire career

04:50.824 --> 04:52.426
as a headhunter.

04:52.460 --> 04:55.062
- Tall tea with
honey and lemon?
- Thanks.

04:55.095 --> 04:55.896
So?

04:55.929 --> 04:58.999
There's nothing moving
out there, Thom.

04:59.032 --> 05:00.401
Nothing?

05:00.434 --> 05:02.069
Venti espresso?

05:02.102 --> 05:04.838
Okay, I'll make
some calls.

05:04.872 --> 05:07.307
What is this?
Why do I get that?

05:08.509 --> 05:10.944
Gottfrid:
It's about creative priorities.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.980
And New York Life
is not one of them.

05:13.013 --> 05:16.950
The team has done
all they can on this account,

05:16.984 --> 05:20.087
but I say to hell
with them.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.989
So you want
to let them go?

05:22.022 --> 05:24.558
I think it's a relic
of the old MGT,

05:24.592 --> 05:26.093
and we're busy now.

05:26.126 --> 05:27.995
I mean, we have
the Coke pitch coming up,

05:28.028 --> 05:30.498
Rob Reiner wants to shoot
the Keebler campaign.

05:30.531 --> 05:32.099
Man is a legend.

05:32.132 --> 05:34.768
Thom, isn't the army
coming in tomorrow

05:34.802 --> 05:36.970
- to do some new project?
- Mm-hmm.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.907
And, Debbie, you have
the meeting with "I Can't
Believe It's Butter."

05:39.940 --> 05:43.577
I mean, that is a big,
big creative opportunity.

05:43.611 --> 05:47.448
I don't want to be
wasting time with this--
this New York Life.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.450
We had a layoffs meeting
this morning,

05:49.483 --> 05:52.453
and you're gonna let
a $35 million account
walk out the door?

05:52.486 --> 05:55.389
We're trying to build this
into a creative shop, Thom.

05:55.423 --> 05:58.726
New York Life is never
going to let us

05:58.759 --> 06:00.761
do the kind of work
we want to do.

06:00.794 --> 06:05.132
Business today moves
at the speed of ideas.

06:05.165 --> 06:10.471
You don't have to like it,
but you cannot ignore it.

06:10.504 --> 06:13.140
I'm claiming no fault
on this one, Jonathan.

06:13.173 --> 06:17.044
The whole insurance category
went comedy a few years ago,

06:17.077 --> 06:19.613
and New York Life insisted
on staying with tragedy,

06:19.647 --> 06:21.148
and now they're getting
their butts kicked

06:21.181 --> 06:23.884
by the GEICO Geckos
and the AFLAC gooses

06:23.917 --> 06:25.753
and the Charlie Browns
of this world

06:25.786 --> 06:27.488
and blaming it on us.

06:27.521 --> 06:29.089
So what?

06:29.122 --> 06:31.158
Instead of saving the patient,
we're just gonna let it die?

06:31.191 --> 06:34.762
I mean, if they
want comedy, fuck it,
let's give them comedy.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.029
How much time
did they give us?

06:36.063 --> 06:38.499
None.
They're coming in Friday.

06:38.532 --> 06:41.034
It's a formality.
Review starts Monday.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.036
Well, if anybody has
any creative brainstorms,

06:43.070 --> 06:44.505
we'll give it a shot.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.173
Otherwise, Gottfrid,
it's your call.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.841
Thank you.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.880
Hey, Larry,
are you okay?

06:54.815 --> 06:56.550
Larry?

07:07.995 --> 07:09.930
( cash register
screeching )

07:09.963 --> 07:12.432
Male voice:
Oh, what you doing, Thom?

07:15.836 --> 07:17.838
Oh, fuck off.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.940
They're just profiting
from your fear.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.610
If you make
one stupid gecko joke,

07:22.643 --> 07:26.814
I swear I will kick
your fucking teeth in.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.882
- Fear of what?
- Death, mate.

07:28.916 --> 07:32.152
The big sleep.
Look at all this shit.

07:32.185 --> 07:35.823
Long life, more energy,
tighter skin.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.124
You know
what would happen

07:37.157 --> 07:39.026
if Julius took every one
of those vitamins

07:39.059 --> 07:40.694
every day for the rest
of his life?

07:40.728 --> 07:42.129
- What?
- He'd die.

07:42.162 --> 07:45.098
He'd drop fucking dead,
just like everyone else.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.167
You're gonna die
one day, Thom.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.237
So is Lee.
And so is Julius.

07:50.270 --> 07:52.973
So what do you suggest
I do about it, asshole?

07:53.006 --> 07:56.510
Walk around making
profoundly lame jokes

07:56.544 --> 07:58.245
whilst whistling
past the graveyard?

07:58.278 --> 08:00.648
No, not whistling,
mate, laughing.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.049
Laughing's all we have.

08:02.082 --> 08:04.852
"Against the assault
of laughter,"

08:04.885 --> 08:07.487
said Mark Twain,
"nothing can stand."

08:09.022 --> 08:11.625
Uh, also, mate--
hello?

08:11.659 --> 08:13.193
Geckos can't whistle.

08:13.226 --> 08:15.028
( laughs )

08:16.163 --> 08:17.631
I warned you, didn't I?

08:17.665 --> 08:19.867
( screaming )

08:19.900 --> 08:21.902
( groans )

08:24.337 --> 08:27.274
Thom's voice:
The problem is
I'm Catholic.

08:27.307 --> 08:30.744
- ( Julius coughing )
- That's what pisses me off
about God so much.

08:30.778 --> 08:34.281
He can never know us,
but the Bible commands us
to know Him.

08:34.314 --> 08:37.751
So, after 44 years,
here's what I know
about God--

08:37.785 --> 08:40.287
the bastard loves
an unhappy ending.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.556
- ( thermometer beeps )
- Jesus saves occasionally,

08:42.590 --> 08:46.293
but God, God kills
with frightening regularity.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.161
What is it?

08:48.195 --> 08:49.697
- 102.6.
- ( groans )

08:49.730 --> 08:52.032
- We should give him something.
- I gave him Tylenol.

08:52.065 --> 08:55.202
- Well, then we should
give him something else.
- You're not helping, Thom.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.337
That's why I want
to give him something,
to help him.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.907
( sighs )
What do you want
me to give him?

08:59.940 --> 09:04.645
I don't know-- Sudafed,
Robitussin, Mylanta?

09:04.678 --> 09:07.247
- Mylanta?
- Something. Anything.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.082
It's all bullshit,
Thom.

09:09.116 --> 09:12.185
Lee, you're a skeptic.
That's why I love you.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.688
But to call all medicine
bullshit is a bit much.

09:14.722 --> 09:15.723
Besides, you're Jewish.

09:15.756 --> 09:18.191
Oh, what does that mean?

09:18.225 --> 09:21.094
You have a thing
for suffering.

09:21.128 --> 09:23.063
It's-- it gets you hot.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.798
Oh, and you chug medicine
because you're a Catholic.

09:24.832 --> 09:26.233
You think God
is gonna kill you.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.802
No, I think God is trying
to kill him to get to me.

09:28.836 --> 09:31.672
All my mother ever did
was pour medicine
down my throat.

09:31.705 --> 09:34.341
I was a Jew living
on St. Joseph's Aspirin.

09:34.374 --> 09:36.076
It never made me
feel any better.

09:36.109 --> 09:37.344
Check the label
on these things.

09:37.377 --> 09:39.847
Half the crap is sugar.
It just makes it worse.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.882
- Shh.
- Yeah, it just
makes it worse.

09:41.915 --> 09:45.152
That's why Africans would kill
for a teaspoon of Robitussin,

09:45.185 --> 09:46.820
because it makes it worse.

09:46.854 --> 09:48.121
You're in advertising,
Thom.

09:48.155 --> 09:49.389
How can you believe
their bullshit?

09:49.422 --> 09:51.959
If Robitussin is all
we have in our battle

09:51.992 --> 09:54.227
against the great
asshole in the sky,

09:54.261 --> 09:56.630
then I'll take
the Robitussin.

09:56.664 --> 09:59.599
You want
to give him something,
give him something.

10:09.342 --> 10:11.712
( sighs )
So what do you think
I should give him.

10:11.745 --> 10:13.280
Jesus Christ.

10:16.283 --> 10:19.386
These may be
our enemies abroad,

10:19.419 --> 10:23.991
but, Generals, these are
our enemies at home.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.893
Parents.

10:25.926 --> 10:28.762
Well-meaning,
but a pain in the ass.

10:28.796 --> 10:30.430
Only 25% of parents today

10:30.463 --> 10:32.733
would encourage their children
to join the military.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.001
Fuckin' boomers.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.769
Never met an enemy
they didn't like.

10:35.803 --> 10:37.871
Yes.
The good news--

10:37.905 --> 10:41.274
children over 18 can enlist
whether Mom likes it or not.

10:41.308 --> 10:45.078
We just need to remind them
what else Mom doesn't like.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.749
She doesn't like
their rap music,

10:48.782 --> 10:50.751
she doesn't like
their video games,

10:50.784 --> 10:53.153
and she doesn't like
their friends.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.288
The message needs to be,

10:55.322 --> 10:58.191
"You've never listened
to your parents before,

10:58.225 --> 11:00.694
why should you listen
to them now?"

11:02.195 --> 11:04.898
Thom, you feel bad
about every army assignment.

11:04.932 --> 11:06.033
That's why we love you.

11:06.066 --> 11:07.901
General,
Julius is sick,

11:07.935 --> 11:09.069
and I keep
picturing him dying,

11:09.102 --> 11:10.704
so it's, you know,
kind of tough

11:10.738 --> 11:13.306
encouraging
other children
to maybe die.

11:13.340 --> 11:17.044
We all die, Thom.
The question is how we live.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.311
Maybe I should enlist.

11:18.345 --> 11:21.181
I'll bring Julius.
Take Your Son to War Day.

11:21.214 --> 11:24.084
I'm hoping we don't
get that desperate.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.452
( laughs )

11:25.485 --> 11:26.854
Be good.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.923
Rob:
Look, don't get me wrong.

11:29.957 --> 11:31.358
I love this concept.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.961
You know me.
I embrace reality.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.329
I love the fact that you want
to imbue these characters

11:36.363 --> 11:39.066
with real emotions,
real feelings,

11:39.099 --> 11:40.734
flesh-and-blood
characters

11:40.768 --> 11:45.272
that will live
with the audience
long after they've gone.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.808
To hell with
neorealism, huh?

11:47.841 --> 11:49.877
Whatever happened
to actual realism.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.144
- Am I right?
- Yeah, totally.

11:51.178 --> 11:54.114
Yes, but the problem
you have here,

11:54.147 --> 11:56.950
these scripts are...

11:56.984 --> 11:59.820
- They're not real.
- Okay.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.388
No, no, no. I mean,
what do you got here?

12:01.421 --> 12:02.823
What do you have here?

12:02.856 --> 12:05.025
You got "Fast Eddie
Gets an F."

12:05.058 --> 12:07.394
"Buckets Loses a Race."

12:07.427 --> 12:08.996
We have
an opportunity here

12:09.029 --> 12:11.398
to do something
that resonates.

12:11.431 --> 12:16.236
You know, a...
Weltanschauung,
if you will.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.972
- Right.
- Think Cassavetes.

12:19.006 --> 12:21.241
Think the Maysle brothers.

12:21.274 --> 12:22.910
That's what we're
talking about here.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.779
- I love Cassavetes.
- I know, I get it.

12:25.813 --> 12:28.548
They're little people,
it's gonna be funny.

12:28.581 --> 12:29.449
I get that.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.985
But why can't we give
them real problems?

12:32.019 --> 12:35.255
And I'm not
saying that, you know,
J.J. should get cancer

12:35.288 --> 12:40.260
or that Mom should
discover that she's got
early-onset Alzheimer's

12:40.293 --> 12:41.428
or something like that.

12:41.461 --> 12:44.397
But what I'm saying
is Nabokov says

12:44.431 --> 12:46.133
you put the characters
up in a tree

12:46.166 --> 12:48.568
and then you throw rocks
at 'em, right?

12:48.601 --> 12:50.804
I mean, look,
they want reality,

12:50.838 --> 12:52.539
let's give 'em
reality, huh?

12:52.572 --> 12:55.408
- Cassavetes.
- Yes. Cinéma vérité.

12:55.442 --> 12:58.879
Love, life,
hatred, anger,

12:58.912 --> 13:00.881
violence, injustice.

13:00.914 --> 13:04.184
All the wonderful frailty
of the human condition.

13:04.217 --> 13:05.886
What do you say?

13:05.919 --> 13:09.089
Can you knock out
four or five of these
by lunch?

13:09.122 --> 13:11.091
Uh, yeah.
Happy to.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.860
Rob:
Great. I love it.

13:14.361 --> 13:15.562
Thom:
I can't believe
we're shopping

13:15.595 --> 13:17.464
when New York Life
is about to walk.

13:17.497 --> 13:20.100
I'm not shopping for me.
I'm shopping for you.

13:20.133 --> 13:23.236
I-- well,
no, thanks.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.973
Just how much of an asshole
do you have to be

13:26.006 --> 13:28.909
to keep your job
these days?

13:28.942 --> 13:31.078
Give a man a fish,
you feed him for a day.

13:31.111 --> 13:32.579
You teach a man
to dress,

13:32.612 --> 13:35.215
he holds onto his shallow,
meaningless career

13:35.248 --> 13:37.918
for another
couple of years.

13:37.951 --> 13:40.453
That's a lot of cat.

13:40.487 --> 13:44.091
New York Life is gonna walk
no matter what we do.

13:44.124 --> 13:46.226
I'm just letting
Gottfrid own it.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.494
It's Debbie's
biggest account.

13:47.527 --> 13:50.330
Yeah, you follow
your heart, Thom.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.499
- That's why you're failing.
- ( phone chimes )

13:52.532 --> 13:55.235
Don't fall on your sword
for Debbie.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.604
Yeah, well,
you follow your head,

13:57.637 --> 14:00.073
which is why
you're an alcoholic.

14:00.107 --> 14:02.475
You know, it's bad enough
that Julius is gonna die,

14:02.509 --> 14:04.344
but I really don't want
to be standing

14:04.377 --> 14:06.346
in a Jack Spade store
when he does.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.648
Why is Julius
dying this time?

14:08.681 --> 14:10.383
He has a bug.

14:10.417 --> 14:13.486
So I spent all day
imagining him being dead.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.622
Julius isn't dying.
I'm dying.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.490
Julius is gonna
be fine.

14:17.524 --> 14:21.094
Yeah, well,
we're all dying.

14:21.128 --> 14:23.296
Not as quickly as me.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.498
What are you
talking about?

14:25.532 --> 14:27.534
That's exactly
what I said.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.502
"What are you
talking about?"

14:29.536 --> 14:31.638
They said,
"We don't know."

14:31.671 --> 14:34.908
Wait, wait, wait.
They? Who's they?

14:34.942 --> 14:37.444
- What the fuck
are you talking about?
- The doctors.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.446
What doctors?

14:39.479 --> 14:41.514
Don't give me
that look, Thom.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.384
And don't say shit
about this to anybody

14:44.417 --> 14:46.553
or you're gonna
have the Swedes

14:46.586 --> 14:48.421
as global creative
directors as well.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.257
They're doing tests.

14:50.290 --> 14:53.026
That's what they do
when you're 52;
they do tests.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.295
It's when they stop
doing tests that
you gotta worry.

14:55.328 --> 14:58.431
- Tests for what?
- Everything.

14:58.465 --> 15:03.203
Gall bladder, pancreas,
liver, cancer.

15:03.236 --> 15:09.009
Cirrhosis,
fibro-fucking-myalgia.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.711
Could be the vodka.
Could be the whiskey.
Could be the gin.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.047
If you ask me,
it's fucking
vegetable juice.

15:14.081 --> 15:16.683
I'm seeing this girl,
she got me into this
juice thing--

15:16.716 --> 15:20.420
kale, spinach,
carrots, celery.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.455
It's gonna fucking kill me.
I'm telling you.

15:22.489 --> 15:25.592
After all these years
of alcohol and tobacco,

15:25.625 --> 15:28.628
my body just can't tolerate
vitamins anymore.

15:30.197 --> 15:32.132
Medium asshole?

15:35.402 --> 15:37.037
Oh, fuck.
I'm fired.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.438
You're not fired.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.573
- Am I fired?
- Nobody's fired.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.710
Do you remember the campaign
we presented to Tylenol?

15:43.743 --> 15:44.677
The shit fan.

15:44.711 --> 15:48.615
- The giant shit fan?
- I loved that campaign.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.717
Write it up
for New York Life.
They're coming in tomorrow.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.719
Debbie'll get you the brief
and support points.

15:52.752 --> 15:56.456
Key frame, 160,
throw in some digital shit.

15:56.489 --> 15:57.991
We're saving this account.

15:58.025 --> 16:00.193
Oh, Jesus. Fuck.
We're losing New York Life now?

16:00.227 --> 16:02.529
No. No, we're not
losing New York Life.

16:02.562 --> 16:05.098
They want funny,
we'll give 'em funny.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.169
Lee:
I'm not one
of those mothers...

16:09.202 --> 16:12.472
has to bring
her kid to the doctor
for every little thing.

16:12.505 --> 16:15.108
You ask me, I think science
is the West's new religion,

16:15.142 --> 16:17.777
and I wasn't that crazy
about the old one.

16:17.810 --> 16:21.514
Scientists have become
our popes, rabbis, imams.

16:21.548 --> 16:22.682
Question it,
you're a fool.

16:22.715 --> 16:24.617
Doubt it,
you're a sinner.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.753
That's the way all religion
works out, right?

16:26.786 --> 16:28.421
Absolute belief.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.623
It's not a placebo,
it's not a sugar pill.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.360
It's not just letting
the body do what nature
taught it to do.

16:33.393 --> 16:36.696
Behold, it's a miracle
from the new god-- science.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.698
For you have found
favor in his eyes.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.433
It's gonna be
23 bucks a pill.

16:40.467 --> 16:41.668
It's a bug.

16:43.470 --> 16:46.139
- That's it?
- That's it.

16:46.173 --> 16:48.775
Well, aren't you gonna
give him something?

16:48.808 --> 16:51.378
- It's going around.
- Yeah, I know it's
going around.

16:51.411 --> 16:52.379
- ( coughing )
- My son has it.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.381
You could try Robitussin.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.049
Robitussin.

16:56.083 --> 16:58.151
That's your big cure,
Robitussin.

16:58.185 --> 17:01.588
Robitussin
is just relief,
Mrs. Payne.

17:01.621 --> 17:04.023
Cures are God's business.

17:07.827 --> 17:10.163
But you're a doctor!

17:17.304 --> 17:19.472
- What did they say?
- They said they don't know.

17:19.506 --> 17:21.741
They said they'll do
some tests.

17:23.843 --> 17:26.413
That's what they do
at my age; they do tests.

17:26.446 --> 17:29.549
I went to look at
that new cookie factory
down the road.

17:29.582 --> 17:32.219
Cookie Manufacturers
International.

17:32.252 --> 17:33.686
And?

17:33.720 --> 17:36.556
They got a machine there, Ma.
You should see it.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.591
It's as big as
the Hollow Tree itself.

17:38.625 --> 17:41.694
In one hour, they can
make 2,000 cookies,

17:41.728 --> 17:44.364
package 'em, box 'em,
and ship 'em out.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.765
So what's the good news?

17:45.798 --> 17:48.835
The cookies
taste like crap.

17:48.868 --> 17:53.606
It still takes a Keebler
to make a Keebler,
gosh darn it.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.576
- How's Fast Eddie?
- His fever's coming down.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.611
We're not out
of the woods yet,
though, but we're close.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.380
Fast Eddie!

18:00.413 --> 18:01.881
You feeling
better, son?

18:01.914 --> 18:03.483
I thought
I smelled cookies.

18:03.516 --> 18:06.386
Okay, okay, that's good.
That's good.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.654
Very good, excellent.

18:07.687 --> 18:10.590
Um, let's try it
one more time

18:10.623 --> 18:12.459
from Fast Eddie's entrance,

18:12.492 --> 18:16.496
and, um, this time,
I want you to think...

18:16.529 --> 18:21.601
"I saved the cat,
and yet I am the cat."

18:21.634 --> 18:23.270
See? See what
I'm getting at there?

18:23.303 --> 18:26.139
- See? We're--
- Yeah, yeah. Okay, thanks.

18:26.173 --> 18:27.774
Okay, good. All right,
let's try it again.

18:27.807 --> 18:31.478
All right, here we go.
Okay. All right.

18:31.511 --> 18:34.614
Quiet, quiet.

18:34.647 --> 18:37.784
- Fast Eddie.
- You feeling better, son?

18:37.817 --> 18:40.753
I thought
I smelled cookies.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.789
Okay, that-- that's good.

18:42.822 --> 18:45.225
Great. I love it.
I love it.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.826
Uh, but on the day,

18:46.859 --> 18:49.229
I want you to get
under the skin of Fast Eddie.

18:49.262 --> 18:53.566
I want to feel
the relief that he feels

18:53.600 --> 18:55.935
when he faces this brush
with death, okay?

18:55.968 --> 18:58.638
- Great, thank you.
- Okay, good, terrific.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.273
Hey.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.542
- Good, yes?
- Those scripts, yes.

19:02.575 --> 19:03.543
Yeah, a bit more life
than before.

19:03.576 --> 19:04.944
- Up a tree, no?
- Yeah.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.713
You know, let's just
keep writing more

19:06.746 --> 19:08.648
and we'll see
where they go.

19:08.681 --> 19:12.252
Yeah? Thom, you can
knock out a few more
tonight, can't you?

19:12.285 --> 19:14.721
- Happy to.
- Lovely. Fantastic.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.389
- Great work.
- Thank you.

19:16.423 --> 19:20.527
- We worked a lot on this one.
- Well, it shows.

19:20.560 --> 19:23.696
( Julius coughing )

19:29.836 --> 19:31.571
( coughing continues )

19:31.604 --> 19:33.540
( sighs )

19:33.573 --> 19:34.807
Gecko:
Oi... ( laughs )

19:34.841 --> 19:36.943
What's 13 inches long

19:36.976 --> 19:40.980
and makes women moan
all night long?

19:41.013 --> 19:42.615
Fuck off.

19:42.649 --> 19:44.451
Crib death.
Get it?

19:44.484 --> 19:46.819
( laughs )

19:46.853 --> 19:48.488
You're a fucking asshole.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.423
Hey, what'd you call me?

19:50.457 --> 19:53.460
I called you
a fucking asshole,
you fucking asshole.

19:53.493 --> 19:56.596
What?
Fuck you, Thom.

19:56.629 --> 19:57.764
Excuse me?

19:57.797 --> 19:59.999
How easy
you humans have it.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.369
Let me tell you
something about geckos.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.471
We can't blink.

20:04.504 --> 20:05.838
We see everything--

20:05.872 --> 20:08.975
death, disease,
every second of it.

20:09.008 --> 20:12.712
You humans blink, what?
10,000 times a day?
15,000?

20:12.745 --> 20:14.714
But we geckos don't get
to close our eyes, Thom.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.349
We don't get
to look away.

20:16.383 --> 20:19.486
It's "A Clockwork Orange"
in here, motherfucker.

20:19.519 --> 20:20.987
We see it all!

20:21.020 --> 20:25.758
So, yeah, we laugh,
we joke, we chuckle,

20:25.792 --> 20:27.360
because that's all
we can do.

20:27.394 --> 20:30.763
Try walking around
with a frontal lobe,
motherfucker,

20:30.797 --> 20:32.499
knowing you're gonna die.

20:32.532 --> 20:34.767
Knowing your son
is gonna die.

20:34.801 --> 20:35.935
Knowing Lee
is gonna die,

20:35.968 --> 20:37.670
that Jonathan
is gonna die!

20:37.704 --> 20:39.739
Oh, woe is me.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.474
I'm a sad human.

20:41.508 --> 20:44.744
Why do bad things happen
to good people?

20:44.777 --> 20:46.813
( mock crying )
Fuck you!

20:46.846 --> 20:49.782
How many times did you blink
today asshole, huh?

20:49.816 --> 20:52.051
- How many?
- ( shouts )

20:52.084 --> 20:54.754
( gecko yelps )

20:54.787 --> 20:58.891
My legs.
I can't feel my legs.

20:58.925 --> 21:02.061
( whimpering )

21:02.094 --> 21:03.396
- Aah!
- ( clatters )

21:05.565 --> 21:07.667
Thom's voice:
See, that's the problem
with the Bible.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.936
Joy is just a setup.

21:09.969 --> 21:12.439
You're in Eden,
now get the fuck out.

21:12.472 --> 21:15.408
You escape Egypt,
now you're lost in the desert.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.710
"I gave you
my only begotten son.

21:17.744 --> 21:20.680
Whoops, now he's dead."

21:20.713 --> 21:22.415
How's Julius?

21:22.449 --> 21:24.817
He's sleeping.

21:24.851 --> 21:27.887
- Robitussin?
- Mm-hmm.

21:28.821 --> 21:30.423
His fever's finally down.

21:30.457 --> 21:33.326
He's not out
of the woods yet,
but he's closer.

21:34.994 --> 21:38.831
I think I figured out
why my mom gave me
so much medicine.

21:39.732 --> 21:41.000
To make you feel better?

21:41.033 --> 21:44.871
No, to make herself
feel better.

21:49.876 --> 21:53.112
Thom's voice:
I guess that's why
happiness makes me nervous.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.748
God's got his characters
up a tree

21:55.782 --> 21:58.585
and the bastard
is throwing bricks.

21:58.618 --> 22:02.088
Mikal:
Somewhere out there,
there's a fan.

22:02.121 --> 22:04.624
We don't know
who put it there,

22:04.657 --> 22:06.559
and we don't know why.

22:06.593 --> 22:08.861
The one thing we do know

22:08.895 --> 22:11.564
is that one day,
sooner or later,

22:11.598 --> 22:14.834
- the fan will point at you.
- ( cow moos )

22:14.867 --> 22:17.970
That's why New York Life
gives you the best coverage
in the industry,

22:18.004 --> 22:22.008
because when it
hits the fan,

22:22.041 --> 22:24.744
we've got you
covered.

22:24.777 --> 22:27.013
New York Life--
you're covered.

22:27.046 --> 22:30.483
And we thought
you could give these out

22:30.517 --> 22:34.854
to your new clients,
'cause, you know,

22:34.887 --> 22:36.523
'cause you're covered.

22:39.559 --> 22:42.462
From-- from the shit.

22:42.495 --> 22:44.030
I don't know.

22:44.063 --> 22:46.666
It's-- it's funny,
but I...

22:46.699 --> 22:49.636
It's not our kind
of funny.

22:49.669 --> 22:50.870
I don't know.

22:50.903 --> 22:53.005
Well, you do, though.
You do know, you know?

22:53.039 --> 22:55.875
That's what's special
about New York Life.

22:55.908 --> 22:58.878
Look, you asked for comedy
and we gave you comedy,

22:58.911 --> 23:00.480
and maybe
we shouldn't have.

23:00.513 --> 23:03.082
Because you know
what we all know--

23:03.115 --> 23:07.687
life is a tragedy,
we die, all of us.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.189
It's an unhappy ending
every time.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.492
A smart-ass gecko
isn't gonna change that.

23:12.525 --> 23:17.530
Charlie Brown doing
a commercial for Met Life
isn't gonna change that.

23:17.564 --> 23:19.766
I mean, Charlie Brown.

23:19.799 --> 23:22.769
Charlie Brown
was born in 1946.

23:22.802 --> 23:24.971
I know that,
because I was obsessed
with him as a kid.

23:25.004 --> 23:27.574
I finally found someone
whose depression

23:27.607 --> 23:28.941
was worse than mine.

23:28.975 --> 23:31.210
What does that make him?
70 years old?

23:31.243 --> 23:34.547
70.
So, Chuck's parents, dead.

23:34.581 --> 23:35.948
Snoopy, dead.

23:35.982 --> 23:38.585
The Snoopy they bought
to replace Snoopy, dead.

23:38.618 --> 23:40.853
Lucy has got Alzheimer's

23:40.887 --> 23:44.190
and Linus is riding
around in one of those
mobility scooters

23:44.223 --> 23:47.594
bitching about Obama
and "secret Muslims."

23:47.627 --> 23:50.062
- ( laughter )
- Thom: That's life.

23:50.096 --> 23:51.798
And you're right,
it's not funny.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.232
And New York Life
knows that.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.668
You're the adults
in the room.

23:55.702 --> 23:57.537
Stay that way.

23:57.570 --> 24:01.574
Fuck GEICO and AFLAC
and all that lame-ass comedy.

24:01.608 --> 24:04.844
Stop worrying
about what's going on
at the kid's table.

24:04.877 --> 24:07.146
Sure, it's loud
and it sounds like fun,

24:07.179 --> 24:09.582
but when tragedy strikes,

24:09.616 --> 24:14.253
when lightning flashes
and thunder claps,

24:14.286 --> 24:18.491
the terrified kids,
and we're all terrified kids,

24:18.525 --> 24:21.594
will come looking
for the grownups.

24:21.628 --> 24:22.995
You.

24:31.070 --> 24:33.673
( phone chiming )

24:38.745 --> 24:41.981
- Hello, Jon.
- How are you, man?

24:42.014 --> 24:43.850
Shitty. Why?

24:43.883 --> 24:45.718
They dropped us, brother.

24:45.752 --> 24:47.186
New York Life.

24:48.755 --> 24:50.857
( sighs )
How's Debbie?

24:50.890 --> 24:52.024
She's drinking.

24:52.058 --> 24:54.594
As am I.

24:54.627 --> 24:56.729
You did everything
you could, Thom,

24:56.763 --> 24:58.598
and at the end of the day,

24:58.631 --> 25:01.634
this is a mark
against Gottfrid.

25:01.668 --> 25:05.004
You got to stop trying
to save everyone, Thom.

25:05.037 --> 25:07.740
I mean,
these days it's hard enough
to save yourself.

25:07.774 --> 25:11.177
I mean, Jesus only brought
one guy back from the dead,
and it was his best friend.

25:11.210 --> 25:13.780
That's not a great lesson
for the kids.

25:16.315 --> 25:17.950
Thom?

25:17.984 --> 25:19.686
Fucker hung up on me.

25:19.719 --> 25:21.788
I heard they were lovers.

25:22.989 --> 25:25.157
- Jesus and Lazarus?
- ( chuckles )

25:25.191 --> 25:27.093
I thought it was Judas
that fucked Jesus.

25:27.126 --> 25:29.696
( both laugh )

25:34.133 --> 25:38.671
You know there's no hope
of a relationship here.

25:38.705 --> 25:41.073
It's the hope
that causes pain.

25:46.112 --> 25:47.947
( whirring )

25:47.980 --> 25:49.649
Gecko:
Oh, come on, mate.

25:49.682 --> 25:52.118
You don't see
the humor in this?

25:52.151 --> 25:55.121
An insurance company
wanting to pursue comedy

25:55.154 --> 25:56.789
that ends in tragedy?

25:56.823 --> 25:59.659
That's funny.
( laughs )

25:59.692 --> 26:02.194
An ad exec trying
to save himself

26:02.228 --> 26:04.230
by saving another ad exec?

26:04.263 --> 26:07.099
A man trying
to save his son

26:07.133 --> 26:09.736
while convincing
other sons to go to war?

26:09.769 --> 26:11.704
It's fucking hilarious!

26:11.738 --> 26:13.039
( laughing )

26:14.741 --> 26:16.108
You might be right.

26:16.142 --> 26:17.844
Of course I'm right.

26:17.877 --> 26:19.145
It's only tragedy

26:19.178 --> 26:21.247
when you don't see
the comedy, Thom.

26:21.280 --> 26:23.215
- It's only tragedy...
- ( car engine starts )

26:23.249 --> 26:25.852
...when you don't see
the comedy.

26:27.153 --> 26:29.155
Thom? Thom!

26:29.188 --> 26:31.390
- No!
- ( crunches )

26:31.423 --> 26:33.760
( groaning )

26:35.795 --> 26:37.864
Asshole.

26:37.897 --> 26:41.267
Damn you, Thom.
Fuck you.

26:48.407 --> 26:51.177
- Hey.
- ( groans )

26:51.210 --> 26:53.880
- How is Jules?
- 99.

26:53.913 --> 26:56.282
Mm, okay.

26:56.315 --> 26:59.786
- What about you?
- 102.

26:59.819 --> 27:01.654
Oh, boy.

27:01.688 --> 27:04.924
Thom's voice:
"Dear Jesus," Nabokov wrote,

27:04.957 --> 27:06.893
"do something."

27:08.094 --> 27:09.662
Oh, shit!

27:09.696 --> 27:11.063
I'm so sorry.

27:11.097 --> 27:12.331
It's okay, honey.
Don't worry.

27:12.364 --> 27:15.802
I think it looks better
with the puke.

27:15.835 --> 27:18.437
I do, honestly.
I think it's more punk.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.172
Thom's voice:
That's why you have to laugh,

27:20.206 --> 27:22.274
so that when you die
and go to wherever

27:22.308 --> 27:25.444
and God says,
"How'd you like that cancer
I gave you, sinner?

27:25.477 --> 27:27.780
How'd you like that AIDS
and that war

27:27.814 --> 27:30.416
and that misery
and all that lovely pain?"

27:30.449 --> 27:33.019
you get to fold your arms
across your chest, smile,

27:33.052 --> 27:36.355
and say,
"Fuck you, asshole.
I laughed."

27:36.388 --> 27:37.890
I should have
gotten large.

27:37.924 --> 27:39.892
- ( laughing )
- Yeah?

27:39.926 --> 27:42.829
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

27:42.862 --> 27:45.297
* If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands *

27:45.331 --> 27:48.200
* If you're happy and you

will surely show it *

27:48.234 --> 27:50.903
* If you're happy

27:50.937 --> 27:53.773
* If you're happy and you

27:53.806 --> 27:56.342
* If you're happy

27:56.375 --> 27:59.211
* If you're happy and you

27:59.245 --> 28:01.848

28:01.881 --> 28:04.917

28:10.156 --> 28:12.992

28:13.025 --> 28:15.795

28:15.828 --> 28:18.130
* If you're happy

28:18.164 --> 28:21.067
* If you're

28:21.100 --> 28:23.736

28:23.770 --> 28:26.739

28:26.773 --> 28:30.176
