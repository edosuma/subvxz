All right, speaking of big feet,

02:05.159 --> 02:08.660
look at this big pair of big
feet right between me and Jeff.

02:08.662 --> 02:09.528
[Huckleberry] Hey!

02:09.530 --> 02:11.530
That's a dandy big.
Look at them!

02:11.532 --> 02:14.800
[Bill] It's got to be 18-20
inches long, ain't it, huh?

02:14.802 --> 02:16.802
Looks like he's wearing canoes
on his feet.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.137
Yeah, measure em' up, Jeffro.

02:18.139 --> 02:19.238
[chuckles] He measures--

02:19.240 --> 02:20.839
16 inches.

02:20.841 --> 02:23.342
[all cheering]

02:23.344 --> 02:24.977
- Wow!
- Whoo!

02:24.979 --> 02:27.880
[Huckleberry] Jeff, if you need
harder numbers, I can unzip my pants.

02:27.882 --> 02:30.048
[all laughing]

02:31.684 --> 02:32.951
[Bill] Wow!

[Buck] Guys, we're the best
monster hunters on this planet.

02:44.532 --> 02:46.965
Damn right!

02:46.967 --> 02:50.969
[Buck] And we're going back to the
Tygart Valley after our favorite monster,

02:51.037 --> 02:52.004
Bigfoot.

02:52.006 --> 02:54.473
[all cheering]

02:54.475 --> 02:56.108
Last time we was there,

02:56.110 --> 03:00.412
Huckleberry found a hair that
we are sure is off of a Bigfoot.

03:01.881 --> 03:04.049
Is that a Bigfoot hair?

03:04.918 --> 03:05.951
[Huckleberry] I think it is.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.187
[Bill] Hell yes, hell yeah!

03:08.189 --> 03:09.454
- Hands down.
- [Huckleberry] Absolutely.

03:09.456 --> 03:12.324
Let's not forget about what we
heard that night at base camp.

03:12.326 --> 03:12.791
[all] Yeah.

03:12.793 --> 03:13.859
Hell yeah.

03:13.861 --> 03:16.161
It's like a damn hurricane
going through them woods.

03:16.163 --> 03:19.131
You've seen that giant pine
tree that had broke down?

03:20.700 --> 03:22.668
- Holy hell.
- Dang...

03:22.670 --> 03:26.271
Whoever the hell busted
that is damn well big.

03:27.173 --> 03:29.875
Plus, we heard that tree
knock, remember that?

03:29.877 --> 03:32.077
[all] Yeah.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.046
- [knock]
- [all exclaiming]

03:36.849 --> 03:38.016
Boys, we got a Bigfoot.

03:38.018 --> 03:41.787
[Bill] That's a damn sure
positive signal of a Bigfoot.

03:41.789 --> 03:44.690
And I still can't figure out how
everybody had each other's clothes on.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.158
Huckleberry's hat on.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.794
- [laughs]
<i>- [Bill] I was in my drawls.</i>

03:48.796 --> 03:49.995
<i>[Bill] Sasquatch!</i>

03:49.997 --> 03:52.731
I had somebody's underwear,
it wasn't mine.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.967
[all laughing]

03:56.769 --> 03:57.569
You can keep them.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.172
[all laughing]

04:03.910 --> 04:06.445
[Buck] Guys, whenever we told
Trapper's daughter, Laura,

04:06.447 --> 04:07.913
we was heading back
to the Tygart Valley,

04:07.915 --> 04:10.749
she said, "You boys had better
get your butts over here

04:10.751 --> 04:12.918
and come see me
before y'all take off."

04:12.920 --> 04:15.053
- [all laughing]
- [Bill] Yeah.

04:18.658 --> 04:20.392
[all] Hey!

04:20.394 --> 04:22.127
Why don't you come in
and get something to eat?

04:22.129 --> 04:23.695
[all] Yeah!

04:23.697 --> 04:26.231
[Bill] Our favorite thing.
Go get some grub!

04:26.233 --> 04:28.066
Hey! How about them biscuits
she made?

04:28.068 --> 04:32.204
I tell you... I tell you what, she is a
lot better cook than what her dad was.

04:32.206 --> 04:34.873
[all laughing]

04:34.875 --> 04:36.108
Yeah!

04:40.813 --> 04:42.414
[Laura] Well,
first things first,

04:42.416 --> 04:45.050
I have a little boy.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.785
- [Willy] It's a boy?
- [Laura] It's a boy.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.120
- Oh yeah!
- [Laura] And...

04:48.122 --> 04:50.155
And his name
is going to be John,

04:50.157 --> 04:51.757
after my dad.

04:51.759 --> 04:52.824
[Bill] Baby Trapper!

04:52.826 --> 04:54.092
- Yeah!
- Yes!

04:54.094 --> 04:55.994
[all cheering]

04:55.996 --> 04:57.829
Yeah!

04:57.831 --> 05:00.932
[all laughing]

05:00.934 --> 05:01.933
Little Trapper!

05:01.935 --> 05:04.903
- Old Trapper Junior, ol' TJ.
- [Bill] Yeah!

05:04.905 --> 05:07.172
I bet the old big brass
will be smiling.

05:07.174 --> 05:07.873
Oh, I guarantee it.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.441
Man, that was some great news.

05:13.079 --> 05:15.113
What about those baby pictures
of Trapper?

05:15.115 --> 05:16.782
- Oh wow!
- [Bill] Wow!

05:16.784 --> 05:17.816
[Huckleberry] That was unreal.

05:17.818 --> 05:18.784
Look at this.

05:18.786 --> 05:22.154
[all cheering]

05:23.089 --> 05:24.156
That's dad.

05:24.158 --> 05:26.525
[Bill] No! No! No way!

05:26.527 --> 05:27.859
Look at that!

05:27.861 --> 05:30.629
<i>[Willy] Man, he was a
heartbreaker from the cradle upward.</i>

05:30.631 --> 05:33.532
I looked at those
pictures and said to Laura.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.934
[Jeff] He was awful handsome.
What happened?

05:35.936 --> 05:38.804
[Buck] She said, "You know,
he started aging a lot more

05:38.806 --> 05:39.938
whenever he put
this team together."

05:39.940 --> 05:41.473
[all laughing]

05:41.475 --> 05:44.042
- That makes a lot of sense.
- [all] Yeah.

05:44.044 --> 05:46.812
Hey! How about that picture
of him in uniform?

05:46.814 --> 05:48.146
<i>- Oh yeah!
- Yeah.</i>

05:48.148 --> 05:49.781
<i>[Bill] That says it all,
right there brother!</i>

05:49.783 --> 05:51.383
<i>[Buck] Looks sharp, looks sharp.</i>

05:51.385 --> 05:52.884
Oh one thing,
when we met with Laura,

05:52.886 --> 05:56.321
she gave us Trapper's old
shoeshine box, full of trinkets.

05:56.323 --> 05:59.691
All right, guys. I'm gonna
give this box to all of you.

05:59.693 --> 06:00.959
I don't know what this means,

06:00.961 --> 06:02.627
I don't know what I found,

06:02.629 --> 06:04.863
but I'm going to give it
to you all,

06:04.865 --> 06:08.066
and I want you to take up whatever
dad was doing in Tygart Valley,

06:08.068 --> 06:10.035
and figure it out for me.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.903
- [Bill] Hell yeah!
- [all] Yeah!

06:11.905 --> 06:13.171
[all] Yeah!

06:13.173 --> 06:13.772
[Bill] That was neat, yeah.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.707
Yeah.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.175
That used to sit right there
beside his chair on that mantle.

06:17.177 --> 06:19.411
Yeah, we went through that box.

06:19.413 --> 06:23.148
<i>There's all sorts of stuff in there,
we don't know what that all means.</i>

06:23.383 --> 06:25.016
Ooh!

06:25.018 --> 06:25.817
[Buck] There's a compass.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.119
[Jeff] Lot of stuff in there.

06:27.121 --> 06:29.020
[Buck] Nice old pocket knife.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.455
There's a hell in that.

06:30.457 --> 06:31.723
- [Huckleberry] Lord didn't know what none of it meant.
- [Jeff] Right.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.225
[Buck] But there was one thing
that stuck out,

06:33.227 --> 06:35.427
was there was that photo
of the Tygart Valley.

06:35.429 --> 06:37.295
[all] Yeah.

06:37.297 --> 06:38.964
- [beeping] <i>- [Buck] We're
heading to the Tygart Valley, boys.</i>

06:38.966 --> 06:41.833
<i>- [all] Yeah.
- [Bill] So, wonder what that's about.</i>

06:41.835 --> 06:44.603
Old Trapper boy,
he was a man of mystery.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.271
- [all laughing]
- [all] Yeah.

06:50.843 --> 06:53.678
[Buck] Well guys, we're
heading back to the Tygart Valley,

06:53.680 --> 06:55.814
and we're hitting the ground
running tonight.

06:55.816 --> 07:01.219
We're going right back out to Willy's log,
where Huckleberry found that Bigfoot hair.

07:02.989 --> 07:05.157
[Huckleberry] What the hell
is it about that tree?

07:05.958 --> 07:07.125
What the hell's this?

07:08.761 --> 07:10.061
[all] Yeah!

07:10.063 --> 07:12.798
- Baby!
- That's a good place to start!

07:12.800 --> 07:14.699
Guys, we're going back
after Bigfoot.

07:14.701 --> 07:16.201
[all] Yeah!

07:16.203 --> 07:19.604
Bigfoot! Bigfoot!
Bigfoot! Bigfoot!

07:19.606 --> 07:22.340
Yeah!

07:24.777 --> 07:26.878
<i>[Buck] Guys, let's go
in and face the obvious.</i>

07:26.880 --> 07:30.248
We're down a six foot five,

07:30.250 --> 07:32.384
bearded, handsome hillbilly.

07:32.386 --> 07:34.953
[all laughing]

07:34.955 --> 07:36.721
Handsome hillbilly,
that's right!

07:36.723 --> 07:37.823
[chuckles]

07:37.825 --> 07:39.925
Got bit by a daggone spider.

07:39.927 --> 07:40.759
[Jeff] Ain't that something?

07:40.761 --> 07:42.828
We hunt monsters,

07:42.830 --> 07:45.130
And we had a spider
take Huckleberry out.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.899
[all laughing]

07:47.901 --> 07:48.867
Yeah, boy.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.135
That's bad, ain't it brother?

07:50.137 --> 07:51.169
Oh, I'm telling you.

07:51.171 --> 07:51.970
[Bill] Yeah.

07:51.972 --> 07:52.471
Oh, boy!

07:52.473 --> 07:54.005
[all chuckling]

07:54.007 --> 07:57.108
[Buck] Well, in Huck's defense,
that ain't no joke, that spider bite.

07:57.110 --> 07:59.144
Check this picture out
he sent me.

07:59.812 --> 08:00.412
Look at this sucker.

08:01.247 --> 08:01.913
[Jeff] Dayum!

08:01.915 --> 08:03.315
Wow!

08:03.317 --> 08:05.083
- Is that on his leg?
- [Buck] Yeah.

08:05.117 --> 08:06.718
[Jeff] Holy cow!

08:07.119 --> 08:10.856
[Buck] Yeah, but he's getting care quick.
So, he should be back at it tomorrow.

08:10.858 --> 08:13.391
- Good.
- But that's not the only issue we're facing tonight.

08:13.393 --> 08:14.659
Jeff, where's the thermal?

08:14.661 --> 08:16.628
Thermal camera's on the fritz.

08:16.630 --> 08:19.698
Be here in a day or so,
as soon as possible.

08:19.700 --> 08:20.765
[Buck] Guys,
I know we're down Huck,

08:20.767 --> 08:22.667
and I know we're down a thermal.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.870
But we came to the
Tygart Valley for a reason.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.905
We're back on the hunt
for Bigfoot.

08:26.907 --> 08:27.873
- [Jeff] Yes Sir.
- Yes Sir!

08:27.875 --> 08:28.473
Yeah!

08:28.475 --> 08:29.341
You hit 'em on the money.

08:29.343 --> 08:31.977
So, I wanna get
in the woods tonight,

08:31.979 --> 08:34.613
start looking for any fresh Bigfoot
sign to see if he's still in the area.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.114
Yes Sir.

08:36.116 --> 08:39.084
I think there's no better
place to start than Willy's log.

08:39.151 --> 08:40.385
[Jeff] Dayum!

08:40.387 --> 08:42.087
That's a hell of a hole.

08:43.155 --> 08:45.156
Right! Yeah baby!

08:45.158 --> 08:47.792
That's your log.

08:47.794 --> 08:50.795
[Buck] Well, think about it for a second.
That's where you guys found that lab.

08:50.797 --> 08:51.363
Yes, it was.

08:51.831 --> 08:52.531
[Bill] A dog?

08:52.533 --> 08:54.900
You gotta be kidding me!

08:54.902 --> 08:58.069
You came face to face with
something inside of that log.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.871
There's something in this log.

08:59.906 --> 09:04.976
[all shouting]

09:06.479 --> 09:08.113
<i>[Buck] And most importantly,</i>

09:08.115 --> 09:12.017
that's where Huckleberry found
what we believe is a Bigfoot hair.

09:13.853 --> 09:15.053
What the hell is this?

09:15.121 --> 09:17.022
Ooh yeah!

09:17.024 --> 09:17.355
Can't forget that.

09:17.357 --> 09:19.057
Yeah.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.126
[Buck] Huckleberry's gonna be
so mad that we hunted without him.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.327
[all laughing]

09:22.329 --> 09:24.829
He probably gonna... big ol'
Marine boot you-know-where.

09:24.831 --> 09:25.997
Hell yeah, I guarantee it.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.999
[Jeff] He screws with me,
I'm gonna go get me a spider.

09:28.001 --> 09:31.136
[all laughing]

09:31.138 --> 09:32.938
[Bill] What do say we get at it?

09:32.940 --> 09:33.872
You guys ready?

09:33.874 --> 09:34.873
[all cheering]

09:34.875 --> 09:35.407
Hell yes!

09:36.042 --> 09:37.208
Boys,

09:37.977 --> 09:39.010
it's time to go find Bigfoot.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.912
[all cheering]

09:40.914 --> 09:42.013
- Let's do it!
- [Willy] Whoa!

09:42.015 --> 09:43.315
Come on! Let's go get it!

09:44.016 --> 09:45.216
Be conscious, boys.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.086
[Jeff] Go easy...

09:48.088 --> 09:52.557
<i>[Buck] Tonight, we're out here looking for
any sign that there's a Bigfoot in the area.</i>

09:52.559 --> 09:56.895
<i>We'll be looking for tree
structures, footprints, food source.</i>

09:56.897 --> 10:00.398
Anything that shows that there's a
massive upright creature in these woods.

10:00.633 --> 10:03.735
Keep eyes open buckaroos.

10:03.737 --> 10:06.104
[Buck] Hey guys, check this
out. Check this out. Look here.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.172
[Bill] What do you got?
What do you got?

10:07.907 --> 10:09.040
Oh!

10:09.042 --> 10:10.175
- [Buck] See this?
- [Bill] Yeah.

10:10.276 --> 10:10.909
[Buck] Mayapple.

10:10.911 --> 10:13.011
[Jeff] Little female mayapple.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.779
- That's the apple part.
- [Buck] That's right.

10:14.781 --> 10:15.580
It's not ready yet.

10:15.582 --> 10:18.516
But here,
in another month or so,

10:18.518 --> 10:22.053
- man, the deer and the turkey will be eating it like crazy.
- [Willy] Oh, yeah.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.522
[Buck] You don't straight up,
just go out start looking for Bigfoot,

10:24.524 --> 10:25.523
you start looking
for his food source.

10:25.525 --> 10:27.926
That mayapple,
it may not fill his belly,

10:27.928 --> 10:30.795
but the deer and the turkey
that are eating it, it definitely will.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.063
- [Jeff] Yeah.
- Exactly, right.

10:32.065 --> 10:34.866
[Bill] Any creature
you go after,

10:34.868 --> 10:36.901
you look for his food source,

10:36.936 --> 10:38.169
bedding,

10:38.971 --> 10:40.071
his girlfriend.

10:40.073 --> 10:43.041
[all laughing]

10:43.043 --> 10:44.409
[Buck] Yeah boy!

10:44.411 --> 10:48.113
Bill, I think you just described
monsters and men, we're all alike.

10:48.115 --> 10:48.747
[all laughing]

10:48.749 --> 10:50.215
Yeah.

10:50.217 --> 10:52.884
We're simple, we're dumb
and we like to have fun.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.286
[all laughing]

10:55.288 --> 10:56.955
Yeah boy.

10:56.957 --> 10:57.656
All right, let's go.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.491
[all laughing]

10:59.493 --> 11:01.626
<i>[Buck] When it comes
to hunting Bigfoot,</i>

11:01.628 --> 11:04.062
<i>you don't just wander into
the woods with a spotlight</i>

11:04.064 --> 11:07.399
<i>trying to see a nine foot tall
hairy ape.</i>

11:07.401 --> 11:08.366
<i>You got to take your time.</i>

11:08.368 --> 11:10.301
[Bill] Keep your mates
moving around.

11:10.303 --> 11:13.938
<i>[Buck] But, if you know where to
look, and what you're looking for,</i>

11:13.940 --> 11:18.176
that's when you can close in on the
reigning champion of hide and seek.

11:19.912 --> 11:20.645
All right,
keep your eyes peeled.

11:20.647 --> 11:22.614
[Willy] Be cautious...
buckaroos.

11:22.616 --> 11:25.050
[Buck] Ho--Hold it, hold it,
hold it, hold it!

11:25.052 --> 11:27.385
[Bill] What do you got? What
do you got? What do you got?

11:27.387 --> 11:28.987
[Buck] There's Willy's log.

11:30.423 --> 11:32.857
This thing gives me goosebumps
every time we get to it.

11:32.925 --> 11:34.626
Damn, me too.

11:34.628 --> 11:37.162
We just spotted that
big, hollow log,

11:37.164 --> 11:41.132
<i>And every time we come here,
it gets creepier and creepier.</i>

11:41.134 --> 11:41.933
[Willy] Damn.

11:42.000 --> 11:42.467
Wow!

11:42.469 --> 11:44.703
It just oozes evil.

11:44.705 --> 11:48.173
I'll tell you, right now is a really good
time I wish we had that thermal, Jeff.

11:48.175 --> 11:50.141
[Jeff] I feel naked without it.

11:51.911 --> 11:53.311
I'm glad you ain't naked.

11:54.980 --> 11:56.948
[chuckles]

11:56.950 --> 11:58.650
That's a lot scarier
than Bigfoot.

11:58.652 --> 12:00.018
[Bill laughs]

12:00.020 --> 12:00.885
- Yeah.
- [Buck] All right.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.153
All right, guys.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.989
We're gonna ease up there
and then we're gonna spread out.

12:04.991 --> 12:05.557
You guys ready? Let's go.

12:05.559 --> 12:07.692
[Jeff] Nice and easy Buck.

12:07.694 --> 12:10.862
<i>[Buck] We need to get up to that
log, but we need to take our time.</i>

12:10.864 --> 12:11.563
Everybody, stay on your toes.

12:11.565 --> 12:13.297
<i>For all we know,</i>

12:13.532 --> 12:18.737
<i>there could be a smoke wolf or a
Bigfoot laying there, waiting to ambush us.</i>

12:18.739 --> 12:22.173
I want you two to go right up
there, where we had the last of times.

12:22.175 --> 12:22.907
[Bill] Yes Sir.

12:22.909 --> 12:23.641
- [Buck] Jeff?
- [Jeff] Yeah.

12:23.643 --> 12:25.944
Me and you just wanna hang back.

12:25.946 --> 12:28.413
Give him a little back up and make
sure nothing pops out on this side.

12:28.914 --> 12:29.547
All right?

12:29.549 --> 12:31.416
[Willy] You be careful.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.651
<i>[Buck] Willy and Bill need
to get up on top of that log,</i>

12:33.653 --> 12:36.654
and look and see if they can
see something inside of there.

12:36.656 --> 12:39.691
<i>It's a perfect place for a
massive predator to be hiding.</i>

12:39.693 --> 12:41.826
[Willy] Remember
what happened last time.

12:41.828 --> 12:43.862
[Bill] You're damn right I
remember what happened last time.

12:43.864 --> 12:46.564
Tell you, right now would be a
great time to have that thermal.

12:46.566 --> 12:47.766
[Jeff] It'd be a life saver.

12:47.768 --> 12:50.034
Bet you see this right here,
look at the [bleep].

12:50.036 --> 12:50.935
<i>- Look here.
- [Willy] Oh yeah,</i>

12:50.937 --> 12:52.670
they got the end of this
right here wore out.

12:52.672 --> 12:55.406
[Bill] I thought something big's been
looked through, look at the [bleep].

12:55.408 --> 12:56.574
- [sudden noise]
- [indistinct shouting]

12:56.576 --> 12:59.744
[indistinct shouting]

12:59.746 --> 13:02.180
[Buck] There it goes!
There it goes! There it goes!

13:03.716 --> 13:06.684
I thought something big's been
looked through, look at the [bleep].

13:06.686 --> 13:11.389
- [sudden noise]
- [indistinct shouting]

13:11.391 --> 13:12.757
[Buck] There it goes!
There it goes! There it goes!

13:12.759 --> 13:14.859
[Bill] Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

13:14.861 --> 13:15.960
- [Jeff] Did you hear that?
- [all] Yes!

13:15.962 --> 13:17.195
[Bill] Look,
that thing is shaking.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.063
Something's going on out here.

13:19.065 --> 13:21.266
<i>Me and brother Willy was up
on top of that log, working down it.</i>

13:21.268 --> 13:23.100
Get out...

13:23.669 --> 13:27.038
<i>All of a sudden, something busted the hell
out of there, could have sworn a thing.</i>

13:27.040 --> 13:28.406
I don't know
what the hell it was,

13:28.408 --> 13:31.643
but by God, it was getting
down and it was big.

13:31.645 --> 13:32.844
Where the hell
did he go to, Willy?

13:32.846 --> 13:34.412
[Willy] He went down through
here, somewhere.

13:34.414 --> 13:35.814
[Buck] Willy, hold up,
hold up, hold up.

13:35.816 --> 13:37.048
Willy, where'd he go?

13:37.050 --> 13:38.216
Don't go in there, bud.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.084
Back up brother.

13:40.853 --> 13:42.253
Back up! Come on, back up!

13:42.855 --> 13:44.455
Guys, we're barreling in
too quick.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.724
Something's big come
busting out of this log again.

13:46.726 --> 13:48.693
[Willy] Yeah, went right down
through them honeysuckles.

13:48.695 --> 13:50.628
I can see where he flipped
over a log,

13:50.630 --> 13:52.564
and went right down through
that direction, right there.

13:52.566 --> 13:54.399
Dude, that sounded like
a freaking freight train.

13:54.401 --> 13:55.834
[Willy] You could tell, that
son of a bitch was having--

13:55.836 --> 13:57.936
[Bill] Oh yeah,
he was definitely big.

13:57.938 --> 14:00.405
[Buck] Is this where Huckleberry
found that Bigfoot hair?

14:00.407 --> 14:02.473
[Bill] Somewhere
in this vicinity.

14:02.475 --> 14:06.477
I know we wanna get in here, and
we wanna get to work immediately.

14:06.479 --> 14:08.913
We know there's something big
still in here.

14:08.915 --> 14:12.717
I think it's best that we back out and
come back in the daytime with Huck.

14:12.719 --> 14:14.152
- Hell yeah!
- [Bill] Hell yes!

14:14.154 --> 14:16.154
- [Willy] Good idea.
- Good idea, brother.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.622
All right, let's go.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.924
If there's one thing
I've learnt over time,

14:19.926 --> 14:21.492
<i>it's when to pump the brakes.</i>

14:21.494 --> 14:22.460
[Willy] Go brother.

14:22.462 --> 14:25.196
Hunting monsters
is a marathon, not a sprint.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.664
[Willy] Come on through.

14:26.732 --> 14:29.400
<i>[Buck] And there's not one
person on this team built for speed.</i>

14:29.402 --> 14:31.336
[Jeff] We're really missing
Huckleberry tonight.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.938
- [Willy] Oh yeah.
- [Bill] Hell yeah! Hurrah!

14:33.940 --> 14:36.407
We need to go ahead and
back out of here for the night,

14:36.409 --> 14:37.742
<i>and come back in the daytime.</i>

14:37.744 --> 14:40.879
<i>We need daylight,
and we need Huckleberry.</i>

14:40.881 --> 14:43.815
I didn't know that good looking
hillbilly was so comforting.

14:43.817 --> 14:45.884
[all laughing]

14:45.886 --> 14:47.252
[Bill] Yeah, no [bleep].

14:51.090 --> 14:55.193
<i>Welcome to
Wild Bill's Squatch Watch.</i>

14:56.762 --> 14:57.495
<i>1700 hours.</i>

14:57.497 --> 14:59.096
<i>No sighting of squatch.</i>

14:59.832 --> 15:04.402
<i>Today, I'm trying to lay my peepers
on old Mr. Bigfoot's hairy ass.</i>

15:04.404 --> 15:06.704
Where you at, Mr. Bigfoot?

15:06.706 --> 15:08.406
<i>I was going through
Trapper's journal,</i>

15:09.808 --> 15:12.610
and saw a section called Recon.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.445
Damn, I think I see a squatch.

15:14.447 --> 15:17.081
<i>It's all about scouting
your hunting area.</i>

15:17.083 --> 15:21.319
<i>Figure out and try that technique out
here on old squatch in Tygart Valley.</i>

15:22.388 --> 15:24.756
It's only a chipmunk.

15:24.758 --> 15:27.825
<i>One thing I'd love doing
when I'm looking for squatch,</i>

15:27.827 --> 15:30.028
is trying out new calls.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.429
Get attention to his old ear.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.397
<i>First up.</i>

15:32.399 --> 15:33.197
A hoot owl.

15:33.199 --> 15:34.966
[imitates owl]

15:34.968 --> 15:37.268
[imitates owl]

15:39.805 --> 15:41.873
I think I hear a squatch.

15:41.875 --> 15:43.408
<i>I like doing
all different types.</i>

15:43.410 --> 15:44.709
<i>Bird calls.</i>

15:44.711 --> 15:51.149
[makes different bird calls]

15:51.151 --> 15:53.418
<i>Hell! I even try a donkey.</i>

15:53.420 --> 15:56.955
[imitates donkey]

15:56.957 --> 15:57.922
Mr. Bigfoot...

15:57.924 --> 15:58.956
[makes funny calls]

15:58.958 --> 16:00.959
<i>I'm telling you one thing
right now.</i>

16:00.961 --> 16:03.394
You're not going to stay
hidden from old Mr. Wild Bill.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.596
[makes funny calls]

16:05.598 --> 16:07.865
I'm gonna lay eyes
on your big, hairy ass.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.734
Just like a cheeseburger
to a baby.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.202
They can' resist.

16:11.937 --> 16:13.671
I have a cutting edge idea.

16:13.673 --> 16:14.939
Check this out.

16:14.941 --> 16:16.708
I'm gonna eat
just like Mr. Bigfoot.

16:16.710 --> 16:19.944
So, I can get right in
the same frame of mind he is.

16:19.946 --> 16:26.117
It is a scientific proof
that Bigfoot love jerky.

16:26.119 --> 16:27.885
You ever seen commercials?

16:27.887 --> 16:29.187
They eat it all the time.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.122
Everybody knows

16:31.124 --> 16:32.924
that Bigfoot eats jerky.

16:32.926 --> 16:34.826
It's a scientific fact.

16:34.828 --> 16:37.261
How do you disagree
with science?

16:45.471 --> 16:48.940
My diet is gonna be like
Mr. Bigfoot's diet.

16:48.942 --> 16:53.044
To wash down this squatch jerky,
here's what I got today, brother.

16:54.413 --> 16:56.781
Good old squatch soda.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.149
Invented this myself.

17:01.086 --> 17:01.953
[opens can]

17:01.955 --> 17:03.321
Oh yeah!

17:08.093 --> 17:11.229
[coughs]

17:12.765 --> 17:14.899
Squatchlicious!

17:14.901 --> 17:16.300
A lot of people don't know this.

17:16.302 --> 17:17.935
[makes bird call]

17:18.837 --> 17:21.873
The Recon is short
for Reconnaissance.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.107
A French word.

17:23.942 --> 17:25.143
Like French fries.

17:28.080 --> 17:31.082
17:23.

17:31.084 --> 17:32.917
Snack break.

17:32.919 --> 17:33.985
Okay.

17:34.253 --> 17:35.253
Okay.

17:41.126 --> 17:43.928
[rumbling]

17:43.930 --> 17:46.597
[strange creature sound]

17:46.599 --> 17:47.131
You hear that?

17:47.133 --> 17:49.600
[rumbling intensifies]

17:49.602 --> 17:50.935
What the hell is that?

17:50.937 --> 17:53.438
It's a...
where the boys is at.

17:53.539 --> 17:55.907
This noise I just heard,

17:55.909 --> 18:00.611
it sounds like started with that farm right
there, where Huck and Will and Jeff's at.

18:00.613 --> 18:01.979
Let's get the hell out of here.

18:02.114 --> 18:03.948
I don't know what the hell
it is.

18:03.950 --> 18:05.716
It sounded like a rumble.

18:05.718 --> 18:06.884
Place coming up out the earth.

18:06.886 --> 18:07.752
Let's go. Get in here.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.020
It's like vibrating [bleep].

18:09.022 --> 18:10.888
Let's get the hell over.
Come on!

18:10.890 --> 18:12.590
<i>I need to haul ass over there,</i>

18:12.592 --> 18:13.858
<i>and meet up with these guys.</i>

18:13.860 --> 18:15.860
Thinking the hell,
what the hell was that?

18:15.862 --> 18:18.162
<i>We need to figure out
what the hell this noise is,</i>

18:18.164 --> 18:19.764
and where it's coming from.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.265
ground.

18:24.169 --> 18:26.037
What the hell was that?

18:29.675 --> 18:31.342
Son of a bitch!

18:32.144 --> 18:35.012
Come on there! Come on!
Get down here!

18:38.417 --> 18:39.851
[Huckleberry] Hey!

18:39.853 --> 18:41.719
- Come here Bill.
- [Bill] You guys hear that [bleep]?

18:41.721 --> 18:43.521
[all] Yeah, we heard it.

18:43.523 --> 18:44.956
What the hell was that?

18:45.390 --> 18:47.892
It scared the living
[bleep] out of me.

18:47.894 --> 18:50.795
[Willy] That came from right over there
by that big northern red oak right there.

18:50.797 --> 18:51.929
Jeff, Willy and me,

18:51.931 --> 18:54.632
we was out here on this farm
for the first time today.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.767
<i>We just got permission
to be here.</i>

18:56.769 --> 18:58.736
<i>This is the shortcut
over to that log,</i>

18:58.738 --> 18:59.837
<i>and then all of a sudden,</i>

18:59.839 --> 19:01.739
<i>it was like the earth
just erupted.</i>

19:01.741 --> 19:04.475
It was like when they're
blasting down in the mines,

19:04.477 --> 19:06.377
- when it rumbles up towards the surface...
- [Jeff] Yeah.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.913
- [Huckleberry] ...that's what it put in the mind of.
- [all] Yeah.

19:08.915 --> 19:12.116
<i>[Huckleberry] It sounded like the
devil was down there using his anvil.</i>

19:12.118 --> 19:12.950
Check this out.

19:12.952 --> 19:14.352
- Listen to that right there.
- Yeah.

19:15.420 --> 19:17.321
[strange creature sound]

19:17.323 --> 19:19.123
<i>[Jeff] Damn!</i>

19:19.125 --> 19:21.993
<i>Look at them cows. It's
got them all piled up now.</i>

19:22.027 --> 19:22.760
<i>Dayum!</i>

19:23.028 --> 19:24.996
<i>[Jeff] Dayum! Listen to that!</i>

19:25.631 --> 19:26.964
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

19:26.966 --> 19:29.200
That's we should come from,
right there.

19:29.735 --> 19:30.868
[Huckleberry] Hold up, guys.

19:30.870 --> 19:32.136
What do you say, we weapon up,

19:32.138 --> 19:33.304
head right on over there?

19:33.306 --> 19:34.372
[all] Yeah.

19:34.374 --> 19:35.840
- [Huckleberry] Let's do it.
- [Willy] Let's go, guys.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.875
We was already planned on
heading back out to that hollow log

19:37.877 --> 19:39.677
<i>where we was at, last night.</i>

19:39.679 --> 19:40.778
I don't know
what the hell that was.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.046
<i>But after hearing that...</i>

19:42.048 --> 19:43.848
[Bill] You know, I've never heard
nothing like that my entire life.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.417
[Willy] ...we're damn sure
headed back out in the woods now.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.986
[Bill] Get the hell out
of here and check this out.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.021
<i>[Willy] We're gonna grab
our weapons</i>

19:50.023 --> 19:52.089
<i>and beat ass out there.</i>

19:52.925 --> 19:54.926
That log shouldn't be out there.

19:54.928 --> 19:57.962
[Willy] Keep your eyes
out for any kind of signs.

19:58.764 --> 20:00.665
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

20:00.667 --> 20:01.732
What do we got here?

20:01.734 --> 20:03.901
[Bill] Look here, boys.
Look here.

20:03.903 --> 20:06.571
Something has been through
there and disturbed [bleep].

20:06.573 --> 20:07.939
Busted up. Look at that.

20:07.941 --> 20:09.340
- [Huckleberry] Oh yeah.
- [Bill] Look at that, Will.

20:09.708 --> 20:10.975
Is that mushrooms?

20:10.977 --> 20:12.777
- [Willy] My God! Look at this.
- By God, it is.

20:12.779 --> 20:13.377
[Willy] Look at this.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.614
[indistinct conversation]

20:16.616 --> 20:19.016
[Bill] Begorra,
if I was guessing,

20:19.018 --> 20:22.386
I'd bet there was a damn Bigfoot
having a damn mushroom stock right here.

20:22.388 --> 20:24.555
- Huh?
- Yeah.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.858
[Willy] We just come up on some mushrooms.
It's been all crumbled up and eaten on.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.927
[Bill] He's been eating
the hell out of them.

20:29.929 --> 20:30.961
<i>[Willy] Them are
oyster mushrooms.</i>

20:30.963 --> 20:34.031
<i>Usually comes
in a big cluster, like this.</i>

20:34.033 --> 20:35.833
<i>That'd be a hell of a snack
for a Bigfoot.</i>

20:35.835 --> 20:38.135
That's a pretty good find,
right there.

20:38.137 --> 20:39.937
That log ain't much further
up there.

20:39.939 --> 20:42.206
Let's keep heading up there and
see if we can lay some eyes on it.

20:42.208 --> 20:43.474
[Jeff] Let's go.

20:43.476 --> 20:46.310
That bastard probably be
taking a nap now after that meal.

20:46.312 --> 20:48.012
[Huckleberry] After eating
that many mushrooms,

20:48.014 --> 20:50.181
I'd say old squatch
has got to squirch.

20:50.183 --> 20:51.449
[laughs]

20:51.451 --> 20:52.850
[Bill] I'd say you're right.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.218
<i>It's starting to get
a little bit dark.</i>

20:54.220 --> 20:56.087
We'd better keep
our damn eyes open.

20:56.089 --> 20:58.022
<i>By God, be on our A-game.</i>

20:58.024 --> 20:58.923
[Jeff] Be careful, people.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.658
<i>[Bill] These squatchs,</i>

21:00.660 --> 21:02.727
by God, they don't
play around, Mister.

21:02.729 --> 21:03.995
[Willy] Easy does it, brother.

21:04.429 --> 21:06.030
[Jeff] Be ready, guys.

21:06.865 --> 21:08.933
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.034
Right there it is.

21:13.171 --> 21:14.405
Last night,

21:14.407 --> 21:15.806
when we was in here,

21:15.808 --> 21:17.908
whatever took off,
come out the lower side.

21:17.910 --> 21:22.079
[Huckleberry] You and Bill go to the upper
side, me and Jeff will go to the lower.

21:22.081 --> 21:23.214
[Bill] All right, yes Sir.

21:23.815 --> 21:25.650
[whispering]

21:25.652 --> 21:27.285
<i>[Bill] We just spotted that log.</i>

21:27.287 --> 21:28.953
It's about 30-40 yards up there.

21:28.955 --> 21:31.389
Take it easy, Mike.
Damn squatch up there.

21:31.391 --> 21:32.590
[Willy] You're damn right.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.892
<i>[Bill] We don't know if that
Bigfoot's up there or not.</i>

21:34.894 --> 21:36.527
<i>There's only one way
to find out.</i>

21:36.529 --> 21:37.862
<i>We're gonna sneak up there,</i>

21:38.196 --> 21:40.998
<i>so we can lay eyes on this
damn big ass, hairy monster.</i>

21:41.000 --> 21:42.066
[Willy] Bill.

21:42.068 --> 21:43.668
- You go up high...
- [Bill] Yeah.

21:43.670 --> 21:45.836
[Willy] ...and I'll go around.

21:45.838 --> 21:48.039
- [Bill] All right.
- [Willy] Go ahead, I'll cover you.

21:49.074 --> 21:49.940
[sudden noise]

21:49.942 --> 21:51.208
[Bill] What the hell!

21:51.877 --> 21:53.377
What the hell was that?

21:55.080 --> 21:56.547
- [Willy] You go up high...
- [Bill] Yeah.

21:56.549 --> 21:58.749
[Willy] ...and I'll go around.

21:58.751 --> 22:00.384
- [Bill] All right.
- [Willy] Go ahead, I'll cover you.

22:02.054 --> 22:02.753
[sudden noise]

22:02.755 --> 22:03.354
[Bill] What the hell!

22:03.356 --> 22:05.790
What the hell was that?

22:05.792 --> 22:08.626
Son of a bitch! It busted right out
out of there. It is busting [bleep].

22:08.628 --> 22:10.027
- [Huckleberry] Yeah.
- [Bill] Did you see it, Willy?

22:10.029 --> 22:10.961
[Willy] No, I could see some
little bit--

22:10.963 --> 22:11.996
[Bill] Son of a bitch!

22:11.998 --> 22:13.397
[Huckleberry] What in the
hell did he--

22:13.399 --> 22:14.765
[Bill] What in the hell
was that?

22:14.767 --> 22:15.966
That was big as hell!

22:15.968 --> 22:17.635
[Huckleberry] All right, Bill.
Keep working it around.

22:17.637 --> 22:18.936
[Jeff] Easy does it now, easy!

22:18.938 --> 22:20.204
[Willy] Keep your eyes
peeled out.

22:20.405 --> 22:21.572
Just stay ready.

22:21.574 --> 22:22.973
[Bill] Slow and easy, brother.

22:23.842 --> 22:25.810
[Willy] Where in the hell
did he go?

22:25.812 --> 22:27.478
[Bill] Slow and easy, Willy.
Slow and easy, brother.

22:27.480 --> 22:30.848
[Willy] I got you covered.
Keep working yourself up.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.217
[Huckleberry] Whatever in hell it
was, it was up here on this end.

22:37.923 --> 22:39.957
[Willy] What the hell
we got here?

22:40.959 --> 22:43.494
We got a big ass cable
laying right here.

22:43.496 --> 22:44.661
[Bill] Look back here, Willy.

22:44.663 --> 22:48.566
The damn thing's connected
round this damn big ass log.

22:48.568 --> 22:51.802
[Willy] [bleep]. Damn! That son of
a bitch has been there for a while.

22:51.804 --> 22:53.871
<i>Me and Wild Bill just made it
to the end of that log,</i>

22:53.873 --> 22:55.740
<i>and there's a big ass cable,</i>

22:55.742 --> 22:57.408
<i>sinched up around the top of it.</i>

22:57.410 --> 22:58.809
Got this log all squeezed down,

22:58.811 --> 23:00.411
bedded into the bark.

23:00.413 --> 23:02.947
[Bill] That thing's embedded
in there. Holy [bleep]!

23:02.949 --> 23:04.749
We start following the end
of that cable out.

23:04.751 --> 23:06.217
<i>And right there it was.</i>

23:06.219 --> 23:08.018
<i>Something all frayed out
and broke off.</i>

23:08.020 --> 23:09.754
What the hell!

23:09.756 --> 23:11.989
<i>Whatever snapped off this cable</i>

23:11.991 --> 23:13.157
had to have some force on it.

23:13.159 --> 23:14.258
Hey Huckleberry!

23:14.326 --> 23:15.826
Yo!

23:16.194 --> 23:19.296
[Willy] We found a big ass cable
hooked right into the top of this log.

23:19.998 --> 23:21.132
And it's broke!

23:21.166 --> 23:22.900
A cable?

23:23.034 --> 23:27.538
I mean an inch and an eighth winch line
cable, like those all one of them big dozers.

23:27.540 --> 23:29.106
Thank God we're headed your way.

23:29.108 --> 23:31.375
[Bill] You know what the hell
it'd take to break that thing?

23:31.943 --> 23:32.810
[Willy chuckles]

23:32.812 --> 23:35.012
Tons and tons of pressure.

23:36.782 --> 23:38.115
Huck, we got a log up here.

23:45.957 --> 23:47.224
What's wrong, Huck?

23:48.960 --> 23:50.227
[Huckleberry]
Stop, Jeff. Stop.

23:53.064 --> 23:54.098
Don't come down here.

23:59.037 --> 24:00.404
We're being stalked.

24:03.141 --> 24:05.109
About 40 yards out.

24:05.844 --> 24:07.411
Son of a bitch is huge,

24:09.247 --> 24:10.748
- [Jeff] Willy! Bill! Ho!
- [Willy] Yeah?

24:10.750 --> 24:12.750
[Jeff] Come down here.

24:12.752 --> 24:13.684
- [Willy] Come on.
- [Bill] What the hell you got going on?

24:13.686 --> 24:15.853
[Willy] Come on, come on.

24:15.855 --> 24:18.355
-Come on! Get down here, now. Come on! Come on, Bill.
-[Bill] Okay.

24:18.924 --> 24:20.124
[Willy] Come on! Yeah.

24:20.425 --> 24:22.026
[Bill] What's going on?

24:23.528 --> 24:26.797
[Jeff] Huck just started looking
that way and he locked up like that.

24:26.799 --> 24:29.200
He's in a dead stare
with something down in there.

24:29.935 --> 24:30.968
[Bill] ...what is it?

24:30.970 --> 24:32.870
[Huckleberry] It's way bigger
than I am.

24:32.872 --> 24:34.138
Oh [bleep]!

24:35.140 --> 24:37.074
It's just staring at me.

24:37.409 --> 24:39.143
About 40 yards out.

24:42.214 --> 24:43.514
[sudden noise]

24:43.516 --> 24:44.581
[Bill] There it goes!
There it goes...

24:44.583 --> 24:46.550
- [Willy] Stay ready.
- [Jeff] Lead the way, Huck.

24:46.552 --> 24:48.686
- You saw it get away.
- [Bill] It's going that way, right through there.

24:48.688 --> 24:49.820
[Huckleberry] Come on, Willy.
Get up there.

24:49.822 --> 24:50.788
[indistinct conversation]

24:50.790 --> 24:51.789
<i>[Bill] We're standing there.</i>

24:51.791 --> 24:54.625
<i>All of a sudden,
about 40-50 yards out,</i>

24:54.627 --> 24:57.595
Sounds like a damn big
elephant going through the woods.

24:57.597 --> 24:58.929
[Huckleberry] Stay with me,
stay with me.

24:58.931 --> 25:00.698
<i>[Bill] Whatever the hell it was,</i>

25:00.700 --> 25:01.765
<i>it was big,</i>

25:01.767 --> 25:04.602
and by God,
it shook this Marine up.

25:04.604 --> 25:05.970
Look, look.
Look right here behind you.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.671
Look right...
Look behind right there.

25:07.673 --> 25:08.873
Oh [bleep]!

25:08.875 --> 25:10.908
[Bill] That's...
bigger than hell!

25:10.910 --> 25:12.843
- Wow!
- [Bill] Look at that.

25:12.845 --> 25:15.846
That big bastard had to get right
through that way, right there, had to.

25:15.848 --> 25:16.914
<i>Oh, look! Damn!</i>

25:16.916 --> 25:19.083
<i>You can see plain as day.</i>

25:19.085 --> 25:20.518
<i>This honeysuckle branch broke.</i>

25:20.520 --> 25:23.187
That big ass creature
went that way.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.055
Look, this [bleep] right here.
Busted right here.

25:25.123 --> 25:27.291
right there.

25:27.293 --> 25:28.826
That's fresh as hell, dude.

25:28.828 --> 25:31.061
<i>We need to get after
his big ass,</i>

25:31.063 --> 25:32.730
and see if can lay eyes on him.

25:32.732 --> 25:33.831
[Willy] Lead
the charge, brother.

25:41.773 --> 25:44.742
[Buck] I know you ain't out
here hitchhiking, Martin.

25:44.744 --> 25:47.044
Hop on in, bud.
Let's get to work.

25:50.715 --> 25:52.216
See, ain't I a nice guy?

25:52.218 --> 25:55.019
I didn't even make you hike
your pant leg up...

25:55.053 --> 25:58.188
[laughs]

25:58.757 --> 26:01.392
I am fired up!

26:01.394 --> 26:04.728
This will be the first time since we
caught those wolves in the Tygart Valley...

26:04.730 --> 26:06.196
We got to wolves.

26:08.433 --> 26:11.602
that the AIMS team
is all back together

26:11.604 --> 26:15.406
on the hunt, and this time,
we're going after Bigfoot.

26:15.408 --> 26:17.274
So sorry if I'm driving
a little erratic.

26:17.276 --> 26:18.776
It's Bigfoot time, baby.

26:18.778 --> 26:20.377
[laughs]

26:22.514 --> 26:24.014
[Willy] Right through here.

26:24.983 --> 26:26.850
- [Huckleberry] Stay ready, guys.
- [Willy] All right.

26:26.852 --> 26:28.018
[Jeff] Be careful.

26:32.190 --> 26:34.158
[Willy] Listen, listen.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.225
Listen, listen.

26:39.698 --> 26:41.031
Something walking.

26:41.132 --> 26:42.132
[Bill] Right down there.

26:42.701 --> 26:44.001
Right there.

26:45.870 --> 26:47.938
- Hear it?
- [Huckleberry] Yeah, I hear it.

26:49.674 --> 26:51.041
<i>We just heard footsteps.</i>

26:51.043 --> 26:52.876
Just right up ahead of us.

26:52.878 --> 26:54.044
Lead the way, Willy.

26:54.046 --> 26:54.812
- [Huckleberry] Take the lead, Bill.
- [Bill] Yes Sir.

26:54.814 --> 26:55.980
[Huckleberry] Go ahead.

26:56.781 --> 26:58.582
<i>We're gonna split up,
so we can cover more ground.</i>

26:58.650 --> 27:00.117
Right in there.

27:00.119 --> 27:03.787
<i>We're gonna try to lay eyes on
whatever in the hell is up there.</i>

27:03.789 --> 27:05.255
[Willy] You ready? Go.

27:12.397 --> 27:14.298
- Come on, bud.
- Are you [bleep] me?

27:14.466 --> 27:16.867
What are you thinking?

27:16.869 --> 27:20.137
Man, the guy moves like a cat and
I move like a big old, fat groundhog.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.005
[chuckles]

27:21.007 --> 27:23.107
[Jeff] Jeez god, Willy.

27:23.408 --> 27:24.441
[Willy] Come on, grandpa.

27:25.410 --> 27:27.177
While I was...

27:29.047 --> 27:31.015
- [Huckleberry] Take your time, Bill.
- [Bill] Yeah.

27:39.858 --> 27:41.091
Are you on drugs?

27:41.960 --> 27:42.960
Not now.

27:42.962 --> 27:45.195
Come on,
let's low crawl up there.

27:49.734 --> 27:51.101
[Willy] It's right up
through there.

27:52.037 --> 27:53.103
Keep your eyes down.

27:53.105 --> 27:55.072
See if we can...

27:55.540 --> 27:56.807
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

27:56.809 --> 27:58.842
- Hey, Jeff! You all right?
- [Jeff] Yeah.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.077
- [Willy] You all right, buddy?
- [Jeff] Yes.

28:00.079 --> 28:01.412
Look at that.

28:01.414 --> 28:02.312
Look at that.

28:07.485 --> 28:09.019
- Look at that.
- [Willy] Dayum!

28:09.021 --> 28:11.121
<i>We're working up towards where
we heard them footsteps.</i>

28:11.123 --> 28:12.589
Good find Jeffro!

28:12.591 --> 28:13.790
<i>And all of a sudden,</i>

28:14.125 --> 28:16.760
<i>Jeff spots something,
looks like a tree structure.</i>

28:16.762 --> 28:17.594
Hey Huck!

28:17.596 --> 28:18.929
- Bill!
- [Bill] Yo!

28:18.931 --> 28:20.664
Come over here.
Jeffro found something.

28:20.666 --> 28:22.132
We need to check this out.

28:22.134 --> 28:23.701
I don't know what to make
of this.

28:23.703 --> 28:24.702
What the hell!

28:24.704 --> 28:26.704
- Dayum!
- [Willy] Hey, look at that!

28:26.706 --> 28:28.939
[Jeff] Look how far it goes up
in there, guys.

28:28.941 --> 28:30.641
- [Willy] Man!
- [Bill] That...

28:30.643 --> 28:32.076
make structures like that?

28:32.078 --> 28:35.846
- Well, we know Bigfoot makes tree structures like this...
- Hell yeah!

28:35.848 --> 28:36.747
[Willy] ...but this
right here--

28:36.749 --> 28:38.882
[Huckleberry]
This thing's odd.

28:38.884 --> 28:42.286
About any tree structure we
found supported itself, hasn't it?

28:42.288 --> 28:43.887
Yeah.

28:43.889 --> 28:48.759
It's been bigger in diameter and kinda,
free-standing, not up against a tree.

28:48.761 --> 28:52.062
[Huckleberry] I can't say
that a Bigfoot made this,

28:52.064 --> 28:54.698
but them trees didn't blow
in there like that.

28:54.700 --> 28:56.400
- [Jeff] No, they didn't.
- Oh, hell no!

28:56.402 --> 29:00.270
I mean, it seems like
we got all this wood,

29:00.272 --> 29:02.740
got some maple
and some oak here.

29:02.742 --> 29:04.975
We even got...
Looks like a piece of...

29:05.110 --> 29:07.211
What the [bleep] is that?

29:14.018 --> 29:14.952
[Bill] Dayum!

29:14.954 --> 29:17.020
What the hell is that?

29:23.561 --> 29:25.329
[Huckleberry]
That ain't Bigfoot.

29:33.938 --> 29:36.406
<i>[Huckleberry] We're standing
there, looking at this tree structure.</i>

29:36.408 --> 29:38.542
<i>All of a sudden,
Willy looks over.</i>

29:38.544 --> 29:42.312
<i>And there's a stack of rocks,
with a cow skull on top of it.</i>

29:42.314 --> 29:44.782
[Willy] What the hell
do we got here?

29:44.784 --> 29:48.385
Something about this just
don't feel like Bigfoot to me.

29:49.821 --> 29:52.189
Well, we know
Bigfoot stacks rocks.

29:52.590 --> 29:54.758
But the cow skull,

29:54.760 --> 29:56.994
it's like that over there,
it just ain't.

29:57.395 --> 29:59.163
- Ain't jiving.
- Nah.

29:59.931 --> 30:00.797
[Willy] Confusing, isn't it?

30:00.799 --> 30:01.765
- [Huckleberry] Yeah.
- [Bill] Hell, yes.

30:01.767 --> 30:04.001
- [Willy] Got that--
- [sudden noise]

30:04.003 --> 30:04.935
[Bill] God!
That was close to Willy.

30:04.937 --> 30:06.036
[Huckleberry] Right in front
of us.

30:06.038 --> 30:07.337
[Willy] See anything moving?

30:08.106 --> 30:09.706
[Bill] Hell no, but I heard it.

30:09.708 --> 30:11.775
Stay ready, stay ready,
stay ready.

30:11.777 --> 30:12.742
[Bill] I can't see [bleep].

30:12.744 --> 30:14.812
[Jeff] Man,
we're flying blind right now.

30:14.814 --> 30:16.346
I need to call Buck
and get my thermal.

30:16.348 --> 30:16.813
Hell, yeah.

30:16.815 --> 30:19.850
Call him, Jeffro.

30:19.852 --> 30:21.819
<i>[Willy] We got something big
and it's right on top of us.</i>

30:21.821 --> 30:23.821
- Hello?
<i>- [Jeff] Yeah, Buck.</i>

30:23.823 --> 30:25.989
We just found something.
It looks like a tree structure.

30:25.991 --> 30:27.624
But it just doesn't feel right.

30:27.626 --> 30:28.926
<i>And then, about 30 feet away,</i>

30:28.928 --> 30:32.830
<i>there's a stack of rocks
with a cow skull on top of it.</i>

30:32.832 --> 30:34.431
Wai... It's got a cow skull
on top of it?

30:34.433 --> 30:35.565
<i>[Jeff] Yeah.</i>

30:35.567 --> 30:37.100
<i>This whole thing
isn't sitting right with us.</i>

30:37.302 --> 30:40.871
We're hearing noises out here, and we're
flying blind, and I need that thermal.

30:40.873 --> 30:43.574
Can you go over to Bill's truck
and get it and bring it over to us?

30:43.576 --> 30:45.709
We need to get Buck's ass
over here with that thermal,

30:45.711 --> 30:47.911
so we can lay some eyes
on whatever the hell this is.

30:47.913 --> 30:50.781
[Jeff] If you take the shortcut
by the East Point Farm,

30:50.783 --> 30:53.016
<i>you'll get here
about five minutes quicker.</i>

30:53.852 --> 30:55.219
You hear Bill? Double time.

30:55.221 --> 30:56.153
All right, bye.

30:57.622 --> 30:58.589
Wow!

30:58.591 --> 31:01.358
If Buck don't get over here,
and I mean now,

31:01.360 --> 31:05.295
there might be four more
skulls right there on them rocks.

31:05.297 --> 31:09.566
Okay. So, they found the tree structure that
they're not even sure is a tree structure.

31:09.568 --> 31:10.868
[Willy] Look at that.

31:10.870 --> 31:12.936
[Buck] But then, they
said they found a rock pile.

31:12.938 --> 31:14.371
That's Bigfoot sign.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.741
But on top of that rock pile,

31:17.808 --> 31:19.443
is a cow skull.

31:20.845 --> 31:24.414
I've never seen a Bigfoot
do something like that.

31:24.416 --> 31:28.785
That's... that's weird.
That's real weird.

31:28.787 --> 31:30.854
I've got to hustle up and get
the thermal out of Bill's truck,

31:30.856 --> 31:31.688
and there's a farm.

31:31.690 --> 31:34.424
Right up the road
is a nice shortcut.

31:34.426 --> 31:36.627
So, I can get up there and meet
those boys as quick as possible.

31:36.629 --> 31:38.228
They sounded
like they needed help.

31:39.397 --> 31:42.132
Man, the Tygart Valley
never fails to impress.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.402
Whatever in the hell that is,

31:45.404 --> 31:47.871
it's cutting around
through our right.

31:47.873 --> 31:50.107
We need to see if we can
cut back around through here,

31:50.109 --> 31:51.842
through our left,

31:51.844 --> 31:53.744
and see if we can some eyes on
wherever the [bleep] this is out here.

31:53.746 --> 31:54.711
Blank his ass.

31:54.713 --> 31:56.246
- Lead the way, Willy.
- [Willy] All right.

31:56.248 --> 31:58.015
Let's cut back out
across this structure.

31:58.017 --> 32:00.550
- Let's head right over through this way. Go, go, go, go, go.
- [Bill] Okay.

32:00.552 --> 32:02.052
[Willy] Come on, come on.

32:04.722 --> 32:05.722
[Buck] Right,
there's Bill's truck.

32:05.724 --> 32:07.157
Good deal, good deal.

32:15.667 --> 32:19.670
Bill asked to borrow
the thermal.

32:19.672 --> 32:23.273
And I have a feeling he's done
something that's got it a little screwy.

32:23.275 --> 32:25.375
Okay, we got batteries full.

32:26.010 --> 32:28.145
Card's not completely full.

32:28.147 --> 32:29.346
What's this video?

32:30.048 --> 32:31.848
No way. Look.

32:31.850 --> 32:32.482
[Bill] This thing on?

32:32.484 --> 32:32.816
[taps on screen]

32:32.818 --> 32:34.618
<i>Hello?</i>

32:34.620 --> 32:35.953
[Buck] Bill's trying to figure
this thing out. Look at him.

32:35.955 --> 32:38.188
[Bill] How's Jeffro
turn this thing on?

32:38.423 --> 32:39.156
[snickers]

32:39.158 --> 32:40.857
<i>[Bill] Yeah! Technology!</i>

32:40.859 --> 32:42.059
This man!

32:42.427 --> 32:43.293
<i>[Bill] Do a little flex.</i>

32:43.928 --> 32:48.298
[Buck] He's flexing in...
[laughs]

32:48.300 --> 32:51.935
<i>- [Bill] Dayum! I'm rich.
- [Buck laughs]</i>

32:51.937 --> 32:52.502
Dude.

32:52.504 --> 32:53.937
Martin, check this out.

32:53.939 --> 32:56.039
<i>[Bill] My old bod's
looking strong.</i>

32:56.041 --> 32:56.907
<i>All ripped up.</i>

32:56.909 --> 33:00.510
[Buck laughs]

33:00.512 --> 33:01.645
<i>[Bill] Who am I kidding?</i>

33:02.046 --> 33:04.247
<i>I'm letting myself go.
Man, I need to hit the gym.</i>

33:04.249 --> 33:07.818
[laughs]

33:07.820 --> 33:09.786
<i>[Bill] Dayum! This belly
is getting out of control.</i>

33:09.788 --> 33:12.222
[Buck] Look at... Look...
Look... [laughs hysterically]

33:12.224 --> 33:14.057
He looks like he's three
months pregnant.

33:14.059 --> 33:14.758
<i>[Bill] Wow!</i>

33:14.760 --> 33:15.826
<i>Baby pack.</i>

33:15.828 --> 33:18.228
[Buck] Oh no!
He's taking his shirt off.

33:18.230 --> 33:22.032
He's taking his shirt of...
[laughs]

33:22.700 --> 33:27.104
[laughs]

33:27.106 --> 33:27.738
- Oh...
- [gunshot]

33:27.740 --> 33:29.206
Ho!

33:29.741 --> 33:31.108
- Do you hear that?
- [Martin] Mmm-hmm.

33:31.876 --> 33:33.176
That sounded like a tree knock.

33:34.912 --> 33:36.246
We got to get on the move.

33:37.148 --> 33:38.315
Get in the truck.
We got to go.

33:39.851 --> 33:40.417
Come on!

33:41.386 --> 33:42.485
All right. Ready.

33:44.389 --> 33:46.823
We got to hurry up and get up
there to these guys.

33:46.825 --> 33:49.993
They're in a bind
and they need our help, quick.

33:51.896 --> 33:53.797
[Willy] It's right
through there, guys.

33:53.799 --> 33:55.298
All right. Come on, come on.

33:56.401 --> 33:57.901
Better than...

33:57.903 --> 33:59.069
It's right up here.

34:03.775 --> 34:06.176
All right, here we go.

34:06.178 --> 34:08.345
All right, we're here. We're
here, we're here, we're here.

34:14.886 --> 34:15.986
Okay.

34:16.421 --> 34:17.954
This is a new farm.

34:17.956 --> 34:19.156
We haven't been on it yet.

34:19.158 --> 34:20.357
This is the East Step Farm.

34:20.391 --> 34:22.158
[coughs]

34:22.627 --> 34:27.097
This guy gave us permission to cross his
property. He's got a big cattle field here.

34:27.099 --> 34:29.699
It's about 300 yards
to the top of the ridge,

34:29.701 --> 34:31.034
and it's a huge shortcut.

34:31.036 --> 34:32.369
This is gonna save us

34:32.670 --> 34:34.337
about a mile hike.

34:34.339 --> 34:38.008
But the only problem is,
he's got a big bull,

34:38.010 --> 34:42.412
And he told us to be very careful when
we get down to the south end of this field.

34:42.414 --> 34:46.049
So, we may have to... we may
have to worry about the cows.

34:46.051 --> 34:47.984
- So, just so you know--
- [strange creature growl]

34:47.986 --> 34:52.122
- Oh!
- [strange creature growl]

34:52.657 --> 34:54.124
Daggone!

34:55.793 --> 34:58.395
[Bill] What the hell was that?

34:58.397 --> 35:00.163
This way, this way, this way.

35:00.165 --> 35:01.932
-[Huckleberry] I have no idea.
-[Bill] Damn! Did you hear that?

35:01.934 --> 35:08.805
- Holy [bleep]! Listen to that!
- [strange creature growl]

35:08.807 --> 35:10.040
[Buck] Listen! Listen!

35:12.043 --> 35:13.210
I've heard that before.

35:16.848 --> 35:18.215
That's not a Bigfoot.

35:20.852 --> 35:22.252
We're hunting the wrong monster.

35:24.055 --> 35:24.320
[strange creature growl]

35:26.791 --> 35:27.991
[Buck] Listen! Listen!

35:29.994 --> 35:31.194
I've heard that before.

35:34.832 --> 35:36.166
That's not a Bigfoot.

35:38.936 --> 35:40.237
We're hunting the wrong monster.

35:44.876 --> 35:46.442
<i>This AIMS team,</i>

35:46.444 --> 35:49.913
<i>we've heard dozens of different
Bigfoots all across the Appalachian.</i>

35:49.915 --> 35:53.083
So, I know a Bigfoot bellow,
when I hear one.

35:53.085 --> 35:54.885
That's between me
and the rest of the team.

35:54.887 --> 35:57.254
<i>This... this ain't a Bigfoot.</i>

35:57.421 --> 35:58.922
Do you have a bag?

35:59.390 --> 36:03.059
<i>But something tells me, this is
a creature we've chased before.</i>

36:04.695 --> 36:05.829
I got to call Jeff.

36:05.831 --> 36:08.965
- [strange creature growl]
- I got to call Jeff.

36:13.204 --> 36:16.206
[cell phone ringing]

36:16.208 --> 36:18.074
[Bill] It's your phone, Jeffro.

36:18.409 --> 36:19.075
Yeah.

36:19.077 --> 36:20.410
Hey! Do you hear that?

36:20.412 --> 36:21.978
Yeah, we sure as [bleep] did.

36:21.980 --> 36:24.414
It shook the trees over here.
The nuts are all on the ground.

36:24.416 --> 36:25.849
[Bill] Hell yeah.

36:25.851 --> 36:27.117
Listen, it's... it...
Dude, it's close.

36:27.119 --> 36:28.718
I... I need some help
over here.

36:28.720 --> 36:29.920
Where you at?

36:29.922 --> 36:31.221
Dude, I'm over here
on this East Point Farm.

36:31.223 --> 36:34.024
<i>I don't have a weapon. I
cou... I could use some help.</i>

36:34.026 --> 36:35.225
- [strange creature sound]
- Hang on, hang on.

36:36.994 --> 36:38.261
[strange creature sound]

36:40.731 --> 36:42.933
Jeff, I need you guys
over here quick.

36:42.935 --> 36:44.701
We'll jump to the side
and be right over.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.069
I got to go.

36:47.738 --> 36:50.106
Buck's over in the middle
of East Point Farm.

36:50.108 --> 36:51.808
He wants us to get over there
right now.

36:51.810 --> 36:54.511
[indistinct conversation]

36:54.513 --> 36:56.446
Brother Buck just called
for back up.

36:56.448 --> 36:58.148
- Let's go! Double time!
- [Jeff] Yeah, we got to get over.

36:58.150 --> 37:00.750
We need to cram our bit
fat asses in this, side to side.

37:00.752 --> 37:03.687
[indistinct conversation]

37:03.689 --> 37:05.889
<i>[Bill] Double time and over
at East Point Farm!</i>

37:05.891 --> 37:07.924
[Jeff] Stand on it!
Stand on it!

37:07.926 --> 37:11.795
Before old big Buck...
becomes extinct!

37:11.797 --> 37:13.730
Buck needs back up.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.131
<i>Get the hell over
to East Point Farm!</i>

37:15.133 --> 37:17.634
[indistinct conversation]

37:17.636 --> 37:19.102
[all] Yeah!

37:19.104 --> 37:20.704
Something's got these cattle
worked up.

37:20.706 --> 37:24.474
They're all piled on in there,
and they're all bunched up.

37:24.476 --> 37:27.277
They bunch up like this
for protection.

37:27.279 --> 37:29.212
I know this seems dumb,
but I'm gonna go in there.

37:32.817 --> 37:33.416
Come on.

37:36.153 --> 37:37.754
It's all right, girl.

37:37.756 --> 37:38.421
It's all right, girl.

37:39.223 --> 37:40.724
It's all right.

37:40.726 --> 37:42.359
Dude, these guys are shook.
Look at them.

37:42.727 --> 37:44.160
Something's not right.

37:44.962 --> 37:46.630
See how all these cows
are facing me?

37:46.632 --> 37:48.798
They're all circled up.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.200
- Calves will be right in the middle.
- [sudden noise]

37:50.202 --> 37:51.301
Did you hear that?

37:52.536 --> 37:54.137
Oh, watch out!

37:54.972 --> 37:57.173
Dude, something's
got these things shook.

37:58.976 --> 38:00.210
There's a predator in here.

38:03.848 --> 38:05.014
[all shouting]

38:05.016 --> 38:06.182
[Jeff] Right here, right here,
right here, right here.

38:06.184 --> 38:08.952
- [Willy] Whoa!
- [Bill] That...

38:09.053 --> 38:10.053
Hey, Buck!

38:10.055 --> 38:10.954
[Willy] Buck!

38:10.956 --> 38:11.955
Buck!

38:11.957 --> 38:12.656
[Bill] Buck!

38:12.658 --> 38:13.923
Buck! Where you at?

38:13.925 --> 38:15.425
[Willy] Why don't you get
on your phone,

38:15.427 --> 38:17.093
and see if you can call him?

38:17.095 --> 38:18.128
[Bill] Hey, Buck!

38:20.898 --> 38:21.197
Hey, Buck!

38:21.232 --> 38:22.432
Buck!

38:23.868 --> 38:25.735
He's not answering. It's
going straight to voice mail.

38:25.737 --> 38:27.771
This ain't good, guys.

38:27.773 --> 38:31.408
[Huckleberry] Willy, you
and Jeff, go round to this side.

38:31.410 --> 38:32.409
Try to find him.

38:32.411 --> 38:34.477
Bill and me will
get in side to side.

38:34.479 --> 38:37.213
We'll tool around on the other
side, see if we can see him.

38:37.215 --> 38:38.948
- Come on, Jeff.
- [Huckleberry] Be careful, guys.

38:38.950 --> 38:39.783
Take your time.

38:39.785 --> 38:42.152
This East Point Farm is huge.

38:42.154 --> 38:43.453
[Huckleberry] Man,
look at all these barns.

38:43.455 --> 38:45.088
[Bill] Hey, Buck!

38:45.090 --> 38:47.891
It's bigger than a damn couple
of big elephant testicles.

38:47.893 --> 38:50.026
If you mind clearing these
barns, looking for him?

38:50.028 --> 38:51.895
Bill knows...

38:51.897 --> 38:53.296
We need to find big Buck...

38:53.298 --> 38:54.564
I'll get it done. Hurrah!

38:54.566 --> 38:57.400
Before one of them
finds him first.

38:57.402 --> 38:59.336
[Huckleberry] See where
the hell that boy's at.

39:01.772 --> 39:04.874
Dude, we need to get around back,
and see what's got those cows spooked.

39:04.876 --> 39:06.343
I thought we was gonna get
run over.

39:06.577 --> 39:08.878
There's something back there.

39:08.880 --> 39:11.781
Something back there and
it's starting to pour the rain too,

39:11.783 --> 39:14.417
which really sucks, 'cause
then, you can't hear very well.

39:15.386 --> 39:17.420
Oh! Look, look,
look, look, look!

39:18.956 --> 39:20.056
That's blood.

39:20.291 --> 39:22.057
That's blood.

39:22.059 --> 39:26.062
<i>I'm working around the backside of this
cow pen, and right there on the ground,</i>

39:26.064 --> 39:26.830
I see blood.

39:26.832 --> 39:28.732
Look. there's more.
There's more.

39:28.734 --> 39:31.267
<i>It's splattered all the way
across this path.</i>

39:31.269 --> 39:33.703
It looked like a steamroller
come through here.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.538
Something big's been through
here. Look how the grass is laid down.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.907
<i>There's something
out here wounded.</i>

39:37.909 --> 39:40.810
I need to follow this blood trail
and see if I can find out what it is.

39:40.812 --> 39:44.047
All the grass is laid this way.
We're gonna start working this way.

39:44.049 --> 39:45.982
Let me check the thermal,
real quick.

39:49.019 --> 39:50.186
- [sudden noise]
- Ho!

39:55.059 --> 39:56.292
There's something in here.

39:56.794 --> 39:58.228
There's something in here.

39:59.930 --> 40:02.265
Get a little distance
between that.

40:03.067 --> 40:03.733
We're gonna check this.

40:03.735 --> 40:05.835
We're gonna look this over,

40:05.837 --> 40:08.371
'cause there's something bleeding,
there's something bleeding bad.

40:09.039 --> 40:10.974
But we're gonna
have to watch, dude.

40:11.142 --> 40:12.976
I wonder what that was.

40:13.411 --> 40:14.978
It might've been a cow.

40:15.946 --> 40:16.813
Look at this trail.

40:16.815 --> 40:18.381
Look at this trail.

40:19.917 --> 40:21.751
Watch your step, watch
your step, watch your step.

40:21.753 --> 40:22.986
Yeah, cut right here.

40:22.988 --> 40:24.053
Look. Look right here.

40:24.055 --> 40:25.388
You's about to
step in that. Look.

40:25.890 --> 40:27.023
That's fresh too.

40:27.025 --> 40:29.025
It's pouring down, the rain.

40:29.627 --> 40:31.795
Blood washes away quick.

40:31.797 --> 40:34.164
Whatever this is, it's fresh.
Real fresh.

40:35.699 --> 40:37.000
There's more blood.

40:37.601 --> 40:39.803
Look where it's all
laid down, right here.

40:39.805 --> 40:42.205
Look how it's all...
all the grass is laid down.

40:45.109 --> 40:48.311
Dude, look. Oh my Gosh! Look.
Watch your step! Look.

40:56.187 --> 40:57.320
That's part of the cow.

40:57.955 --> 40:59.322
Where's the rest of it?

41:01.826 --> 41:03.426
We've got a cow killer in here.

41:05.696 --> 41:07.931
Something ripped this thing
to pieces.

41:07.933 --> 41:09.866
It looks like this cow
ate a grenade and exploded...

41:09.868 --> 41:11.401
Look at these lungs.

41:11.403 --> 41:12.635
<i>or someone threw it
through a wood chipper.</i>

41:12.637 --> 41:13.536
That it's esophagus.

41:13.538 --> 41:15.905
There's its stomach,
there's its tongue.

41:15.907 --> 41:21.010
<i>What out here is powerful enough
to rip apart a full grown cow like this?</i>

41:21.012 --> 41:24.314
Like something made short work
of this, in a hurry.

41:25.049 --> 41:25.882
- Some--
- [sudden noise]

41:25.884 --> 41:27.283
Oh! Daggone!

41:28.219 --> 41:28.952
Do you hear that?

41:28.986 --> 41:30.286
Look.

41:33.023 --> 41:35.091
I can't s... Dude, I don't even
know how to work this thing.

41:36.927 --> 41:37.560
[strange creature sound]

41:37.562 --> 41:38.394
[Buck] Ho! Listen! Listen!

41:41.065 --> 41:42.031
We got to move.

41:42.666 --> 41:43.333
We got to move.

41:44.902 --> 41:45.902
We got to get shelter, now.

41:45.904 --> 41:48.838
Come on. We got to go,
we got to go. Come on!

41:48.840 --> 41:50.473
We got to go. We got to move,
we got to move.

41:50.475 --> 41:52.475
[strange creature sound]

41:52.477 --> 41:55.278
Come on! We got to
get in this barn. Let's go.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.013
Get in there! Get in
there! Get in there!
