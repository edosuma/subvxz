[Horn honks]

00:03.040 --> 00:04.640
I'm Alex Mack.

00:04.640 --> 00:06.040
I was just an average kid until

00:06.040 --> 00:08.160
an accident changed my life.

00:08.160 --> 00:09.960
And since then,

00:09.960 --> 00:11.960
nothing's been the same.

00:35.640 --> 00:36.720
My best friend Ray thinks

00:36.720 --> 00:38.680
it's cool.

00:39.720 --> 00:40.640
My sister Annie thinks

00:40.640 --> 00:43.720
I'm a science project.

00:43.720 --> 00:45.520
I can't let anyone else know,

00:45.520 --> 00:47.520
not even my parents.

00:50.320 --> 00:51.760
I know the Chemical Plant wants

00:51.760 --> 00:52.880
to find me and turn me into

00:52.880 --> 00:54.080
some experiment,

00:54.080 --> 00:55.280
but you know something?

00:55.280 --> 00:56.360
I guess I'm not so average

00:56.360 --> 00:58.320
anymore.

00:59.920 --> 01:00.840
[Grunts]

01:03.160 --> 01:05.160
[Laughs]

01:07.400 --> 01:08.520
I thought that having the

01:08.520 --> 01:09.480
powers would change my life

01:09.480 --> 01:12.440
and maybe they have a little.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.560
But how come I'm just as scared

01:13.560 --> 01:15.720
of 8th grade as I was of 7th?

01:15.720 --> 01:16.840
Right here. Right here.

01:16.840 --> 01:18.440
[Grunt]

01:18.440 --> 01:19.520
Hey, yo, Al.

01:19.520 --> 01:21.480
Give me the puck?

01:31.840 --> 01:33.920
[Screeching tires]

01:33.920 --> 01:35.440
Whoa, look out.

01:35.440 --> 01:36.480
Is that Annie?

01:36.480 --> 01:37.480
[Laughs]

01:37.480 --> 01:38.720
Yeah, can you believe it?

01:38.720 --> 01:40.880
[Laughter]

01:40.880 --> 01:42.880
Whoa.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.360
How can you ignore the

01:47.360 --> 01:48.640
progress we've made in the past

01:48.640 --> 01:49.640
12 months?

01:49.640 --> 01:50.520
Well, because your view of

01:50.520 --> 01:51.560
progress and mine aren't the

01:51.560 --> 01:52.880
same, Ms. Atron.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.000
We've thrown tens of millions of

01:54.000 --> 01:56.720
dollars into this GC-161 project

01:56.720 --> 01:58.120
and so far I've seen nothing

01:58.120 --> 01:59.360
to make me feel our investment

01:59.360 --> 02:00.400
was well spent.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.560
With all due respect, we were

02:02.560 --> 02:04.160
in the process of developing for

02:04.160 --> 02:05.520
you what could become the most

02:05.520 --> 02:06.840
sought after drug in modern

02:06.840 --> 02:08.160
history.

02:08.160 --> 02:10.120
A vanity drug that preserves

02:10.120 --> 02:11.920
youth, health and fitness

02:11.920 --> 02:13.080
without exercise?

02:13.080 --> 02:14.520
[Laughs] Please.

02:14.520 --> 02:16.040
This is a trillion dollar

02:16.040 --> 02:17.360
jackpot here.

02:17.360 --> 02:18.480
Yeah, only if it's

02:18.480 --> 02:19.320
manufactured.

02:19.320 --> 02:20.400
But if we don't see some results

02:20.400 --> 02:21.760
soon, we're going to withdraw

02:21.760 --> 02:23.600
all funding.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.520
Is that a threat?

02:25.520 --> 02:27.480
It's a promise, Ms. Atron.

02:31.920 --> 02:33.200
Canada is where I belong,

02:33.200 --> 02:34.480
in hockey school.

02:34.480 --> 02:35.600
The NHL doesn't even care

02:35.600 --> 02:37.400
if I understand Algebra or not.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.280
Last year it was the NBA,

02:39.280 --> 02:40.440
the year before you were going

02:40.440 --> 02:41.880
to be a chess master,

02:41.880 --> 02:42.680
when we were eight, you wanted

02:42.680 --> 02:43.880
to be a sumo wrestler,

02:43.880 --> 02:44.720
remember?

02:44.720 --> 02:46.880
"I just got to get fat Alex."

02:46.880 --> 02:49.800
[Screeching tires]

02:49.800 --> 02:50.960
[Laughter]

02:53.840 --> 02:55.840
[Crash]

03:04.800 --> 03:06.000
Oh, no dents.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.120
Hey, I think I'm ready for the

03:07.120 --> 03:08.040
test, don't you?

03:08.040 --> 03:09.600
I think possibly it couldn't

03:09.600 --> 03:10.880
hurt for you to have a few

03:10.880 --> 03:11.840
more lessons.

03:11.840 --> 03:13.000
I'm going to go inside

03:13.000 --> 03:14.080
and lie down.

03:14.080 --> 03:17.000
[Laughter]

03:18.080 --> 03:20.680
What are you laughing at?

03:20.680 --> 03:22.040
A couple more lessons?

03:22.040 --> 03:23.880
Annie, you're the worst driver

03:23.880 --> 03:24.960
I've ever seen.

03:24.960 --> 03:26.200
How can you say that?

03:26.200 --> 03:27.640
The car is supposed to remain

03:27.640 --> 03:29.000
on the street at all times

03:29.000 --> 03:30.480
when you're driving.

03:30.480 --> 03:32.040
Oh, go easy on her, Ray.

03:32.040 --> 03:33.480
Annie's not used to criticism.

03:33.480 --> 03:34.520
Hey, what are you doing with

03:34.520 --> 03:35.520
the journal out here?

03:35.520 --> 03:36.360
I told you it should never

03:36.360 --> 03:37.160
leave the house.

03:37.160 --> 03:38.040
What's the big deal?

03:38.040 --> 03:39.120
I'm just outside.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.800
Alex, you still don't seem to

03:40.800 --> 03:42.200
grasp the entire concept

03:42.200 --> 03:43.080
of the journal.

03:43.080 --> 03:44.440
What are you talking about?

03:44.440 --> 03:45.800
Look, you complained about

03:45.800 --> 03:46.880
all the testing I was doing on

03:46.880 --> 03:48.760
you, so in my attempt to make

03:48.760 --> 03:50.080
your life a little easier,

03:50.080 --> 03:50.880
I gave you the journal

03:50.880 --> 03:52.120
to fill out every time you used

03:52.120 --> 03:52.760
the powers.

03:52.760 --> 03:54.720
I've been doing it.

03:55.880 --> 03:57.840
Mm-hmm.

03:58.840 --> 03:59.760
Tuesday.

03:59.760 --> 04:01.240
Today I realized that I probably

04:01.240 --> 04:03.200
have no future whatsoever.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.520
School starts in two days

04:04.520 --> 04:05.520
and I'm just getting sicker

04:05.520 --> 04:06.840
and sicker waiting for it.

04:06.840 --> 04:07.600
Oh, yeah.

04:07.600 --> 04:08.920
I also floated some cookies over

04:08.920 --> 04:10.800
to me when Dad wasn't looking.

04:10.800 --> 04:11.920
So?

04:11.920 --> 04:13.040
What's wrong with that?

04:13.040 --> 04:14.040
Alex, this is supposed to be

04:14.040 --> 04:15.760
a scientific log, not a personal

04:15.760 --> 04:17.079
diary detailing your little

04:17.079 --> 04:18.240
mood swings.

04:18.240 --> 04:19.040
But just writing about

04:19.040 --> 04:20.560
the powers is boring.

04:20.560 --> 04:21.680
Shouldn't be.

04:21.680 --> 04:22.920
All you have to do is test

04:22.920 --> 04:23.920
yourself and then enter

04:23.920 --> 04:24.760
the results.

04:24.760 --> 04:25.800
I think the whole idea of

04:25.800 --> 04:27.880
the journal is stupid.

04:27.880 --> 04:29.920
I'm not gonna argue with you.

04:29.920 --> 04:30.960
You know how dangerous it is

04:30.960 --> 04:31.680
if somebody reads what you

04:31.680 --> 04:32.760
wrote in there and you still

04:32.760 --> 04:33.600
brought it outside.

04:33.600 --> 04:34.400
Hey, why don't you just go

04:34.400 --> 04:36.040
read it to Mom?

04:36.040 --> 04:37.520
With everything that's at stake,

04:37.520 --> 04:38.600
I was hoping that you would be

04:38.600 --> 04:39.800
able to help me out a little bit

04:39.800 --> 04:41.160
but you're obviously too young

04:41.160 --> 04:42.520
to take a real science project

04:42.520 --> 04:43.320
seriously.

04:43.320 --> 04:44.440
If you want a diary,

04:44.440 --> 04:45.200
get a diary.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.200
This is research.

05:25.600 --> 05:26.840
Wednesday.

05:26.840 --> 05:28.000
Today I used my telekinetic

05:28.000 --> 05:28.960
power to float a hockey puck

05:28.960 --> 05:30.040
to myself.

05:30.040 --> 05:31.000
I notice that it's getting

05:31.000 --> 05:32.280
easier, taking less effort

05:32.280 --> 05:33.760
and concentration to work.

05:33.760 --> 05:34.400
It came to me straight

05:34.400 --> 05:36.720
without wobbling or anything.

05:58.840 --> 06:00.440
Vince, we've got to talk.

06:00.440 --> 06:02.200
At once, Ms. Atron.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.480
I've got to see the effects

06:03.480 --> 06:05.360
of GC-161 on a human being.

06:05.360 --> 06:06.640
I can't wait any longer.

06:06.640 --> 06:07.800
They're about to shut me down.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.080
I feel we're getting very

06:09.080 --> 06:10.400
close to finding that child,

06:10.400 --> 06:11.040
Ms. Atron.

06:11.040 --> 06:11.760
I don't want to hear that

06:11.760 --> 06:12.640
anymore.

06:12.640 --> 06:13.640
I don't want to say it

06:13.640 --> 06:14.480
anymore.

06:14.480 --> 06:15.400
[Sigh]

06:15.400 --> 06:17.000
Vince, despite all your

06:17.000 --> 06:18.760
assurances, the search has been

06:18.760 --> 06:20.280
totally ineffectual.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.120
Now if they pull the funding

06:22.120 --> 06:22.920
for this plant,

06:22.920 --> 06:23.720
everything I've worked for

06:23.720 --> 06:25.480
will be ruined!

06:25.480 --> 06:26.720
And I can guarantee you

06:26.720 --> 06:28.960
I will find another job.

06:28.960 --> 06:31.400
I can't assure you of the same.

06:31.400 --> 06:34.840
Am I understood?

06:34.840 --> 06:37.240
Of course you are, Ms. Atron.

06:37.240 --> 06:39.200
I welcome the challenge.

06:49.920 --> 06:51.000
Hey, Alex.

06:51.000 --> 06:51.760
Hi.

06:51.760 --> 06:52.760
Hey, Ray, what's going on?

06:52.760 --> 06:53.640
Have a good summer?

06:53.640 --> 06:54.520
Great.

06:54.520 --> 06:56.160
Ray, good to see you.

06:56.160 --> 06:58.800
What's up, Ray?

06:58.800 --> 07:00.760
Alex.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.960
Annie, I know school doesn't

07:06.960 --> 07:08.160
start for a few days but you

07:08.160 --> 07:09.000
really should get out

07:09.000 --> 07:09.920
and get a little air.

07:09.920 --> 07:11.920
Right.

07:12.960 --> 07:14.520
Are those Alex's gym clothes

07:14.520 --> 07:15.440
she forgot?

07:15.440 --> 07:16.280
Don't worry.

07:16.280 --> 07:17.240
Anything Alex wears

07:17.240 --> 07:18.560
could double as gym attire.

07:18.560 --> 07:19.440
But she told me she needed

07:19.440 --> 07:21.520
these for today.

07:21.520 --> 07:23.320
Annie, sweetheart,

07:23.320 --> 07:24.520
would you mind doing me a favor,

07:24.520 --> 07:25.200
please, and walking these

07:25.200 --> 07:25.840
over to school?

07:25.840 --> 07:26.920
I'd do it but I'm late

07:26.920 --> 07:27.760
for a meeting.

07:27.760 --> 07:29.600
Yes, Mom. I would mind.

07:29.600 --> 07:30.840
Fine, Annie.

07:30.840 --> 07:31.920
Don't do me any favors.

07:31.920 --> 07:33.320
Really, forget I even asked.

07:33.320 --> 07:34.160
[Sigh]

07:34.160 --> 07:37.280
Just--just give it to me okay.

07:37.280 --> 07:38.760
Thank you.

07:38.760 --> 07:40.720
[Giggles]

07:47.440 --> 07:50.440
[Cheering]

07:50.440 --> 07:52.440
Good job.

07:53.320 --> 07:54.400
Hey, Scott.

07:54.400 --> 07:55.560
Hey, Alex.

07:55.560 --> 07:56.320
What's going on?

07:56.320 --> 07:57.880
You look great.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.760
Thanks.

07:59.760 --> 08:01.280
So what's up with Jessica?

08:01.280 --> 08:02.240
I haven't seen her yet.

08:02.240 --> 08:03.400
Oh, yeah, Jessica is gone.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.280
She moved away with her family.

08:05.280 --> 08:06.160
Really?

08:06.160 --> 08:07.280
Yeah.

08:07.280 --> 08:08.000
Do you miss her?

08:08.000 --> 08:08.760
Yeah, a little.

08:08.760 --> 08:10.080
Sometimes.

08:10.080 --> 08:11.760
Scott.

08:11.760 --> 08:12.680
I've been looking for you

08:12.680 --> 08:13.760
everywhere.

08:13.760 --> 08:14.440
Oh, hey, Kelly.

08:14.440 --> 08:15.520
This is Alex Mack.

08:15.520 --> 08:16.200
Alex, this is Kelly.

08:16.200 --> 08:17.280
She's new to atron.

08:17.280 --> 08:18.200
Hi.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.480
Hey.

08:19.480 --> 08:21.440
You're an 8th grader right?

08:22.640 --> 08:25.040
Yeah.

08:25.040 --> 08:26.640
Scott, I was going across

08:26.640 --> 08:27.480
the street to pick something up

08:27.480 --> 08:28.240
to eat.

08:28.240 --> 08:29.360
I can get you something.

08:29.360 --> 08:30.240
No, that's okay.

08:30.240 --> 08:31.440
I've got to get back to the gym.

08:31.440 --> 08:32.360
Hey, Alex, you should try out

08:32.360 --> 08:33.559
for the volleyball team today.

08:33.559 --> 08:34.600
They're having sign ups.

08:34.600 --> 08:35.679
I don't think so.

08:35.679 --> 08:36.320
All right, well,

08:36.320 --> 08:37.080
if you change your mind,

08:37.080 --> 08:38.200
sign up sheet's outside.

08:38.200 --> 08:38.840
Maybe.

08:38.840 --> 08:39.480
All right.

08:39.480 --> 08:40.120
Hey, see you guys later.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.080
See ya.

08:46.040 --> 08:47.160
Now exactly what type of

08:47.160 --> 08:48.200
cockroach are we looking for,

08:48.200 --> 08:48.840
Vince?

08:48.840 --> 08:50.400
Dave, we are going to do one

08:50.400 --> 08:52.240
more tour of the school area.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.480
A major tour.

08:53.480 --> 08:54.520
That kid is out there.

08:54.520 --> 08:55.800
And unfortunately, you're my

08:55.800 --> 08:57.480
only chance of recognizing him.

08:57.480 --> 08:58.160
Well, because it makes

08:58.160 --> 08:59.160
a difference.

08:59.160 --> 09:00.000
Now you've got your oriental

09:00.000 --> 09:01.880
cockroach, your American,

09:01.880 --> 09:04.440
Australian, your German, Asian,

09:04.440 --> 09:05.800
not to mention your brown banded

09:05.800 --> 09:07.160
roach.

09:07.160 --> 09:08.560
Now he's a tricky sucker.

09:08.560 --> 09:09.840
Now each one of these pesky

09:09.840 --> 09:10.960
critters has a different M.O.

09:10.960 --> 09:12.240
Dave,

09:12.240 --> 09:13.360
why can't you ever just

09:13.360 --> 09:14.680
listen to me?

09:14.680 --> 09:16.120
My uncle's an exterminator.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.240
They used to call him

09:17.240 --> 09:18.320
Jerry Bugs.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.880
He was a legend in the business.

09:19.880 --> 09:21.560
Would you just keep your mind

09:21.560 --> 09:22.920
on what you're doing?

09:22.920 --> 09:24.440
You get the coolest stuff,

09:24.440 --> 09:25.320
Vince.

09:25.320 --> 09:27.480
Dave, let me explain this

09:27.480 --> 09:28.880
to you more clearly.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.360
We are under major pressure here

09:30.360 --> 09:31.680
and if we don't find that kid

09:31.680 --> 09:33.600
soon, I may lose my job.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.840
And if I lose my job, well,

09:35.840 --> 09:37.000
you can just imagine

09:37.000 --> 09:38.960
what that's gonna mean for you.

10:02.080 --> 10:03.120
I'd hate to see that happen

10:03.120 --> 10:05.120
to you, Vince.

10:26.280 --> 10:26.920
Where's that D?

10:26.920 --> 10:27.600
Where's that D?

10:27.600 --> 10:29.560
Oh, yeah, there it is.

10:29.560 --> 10:30.720
There it is.

10:30.720 --> 10:33.400
Go up, go up, go up, go up.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.600
Cool.

10:35.960 --> 10:38.120
Hey, Scott.

10:38.120 --> 10:39.480
[Grunt]

10:39.480 --> 10:40.400
Hey, time out, guys.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.800
Time out.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.840
Hey, are you okay?

10:44.840 --> 10:46.640
I hate sports.

10:46.640 --> 10:47.320
I'm sorry about that,

10:47.320 --> 10:47.960
I thought you were one of

10:47.960 --> 10:49.960
the other players.

10:54.840 --> 10:55.520
Hi.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.720
You okay?

11:00.720 --> 11:01.920
Can you get up?

11:01.920 --> 11:03.880
Yeah.

11:06.680 --> 11:08.880
Are you sure you can stand?

11:08.880 --> 11:09.520
I remember you from that

11:09.520 --> 11:10.400
fundraiser thing we helped your

11:10.400 --> 11:11.280
Mom with.

11:11.280 --> 11:12.200
You're Alex's genius sister,

11:12.200 --> 11:12.840
right?

11:12.840 --> 11:13.600
Oh, I don't know

11:13.600 --> 11:14.560
about genius.

11:14.560 --> 11:16.520
[Laughs]

11:29.600 --> 11:31.080
Alex and I are not

11:31.080 --> 11:31.800
exactly alike.

11:31.800 --> 11:32.560
Oh, come on.

11:32.560 --> 11:33.600
I'm sure you're just like her.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.080
Yeah, when I was nine maybe.

11:35.080 --> 11:35.720
[Laughter]

11:35.720 --> 11:37.720
But--in fact, considering

11:37.720 --> 11:38.480
that we're related,

11:38.480 --> 11:39.360
she happens to be

11:39.360 --> 11:41.360
kind of average, you know.

11:41.360 --> 11:42.920
[Laughter]

11:42.920 --> 11:44.040
[Bell rings]

11:44.040 --> 11:44.680
All right, guys.

11:44.680 --> 11:46.680
Bring it in.

11:52.480 --> 11:53.720
Are you gonna see Alex later?

11:53.720 --> 11:54.440
Yeah, I should probably

11:54.440 --> 11:55.080
see her.

11:55.080 --> 11:56.440
Great.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.400
I've got to get out of here.

12:06.640 --> 12:09.000
Where am I?

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Oh, no.

12:12.920 --> 12:13.880
I've got to hide,

12:13.880 --> 12:15.840
I've got to hide.

12:16.840 --> 12:18.800
I've got to hide.

12:34.680 --> 12:36.720
[Scream]

12:36.720 --> 12:37.440
Hi.

12:39.080 --> 12:41.040
Excuse me.

12:43.600 --> 12:44.200
Ms. Atron,

12:44.200 --> 12:45.320
you asked to see me?

12:45.320 --> 12:46.440
Yes.

12:46.440 --> 12:48.400
Take a seat.

12:50.480 --> 12:52.480
[Chuckles]

12:53.560 --> 12:56.200
Is there a problem, Ms. Atron?

12:56.200 --> 12:58.160
Not that I know of.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.200
Is there?

12:59.200 --> 13:01.440
I don't think so.

13:01.440 --> 13:02.520
Good.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.920
Make sure you keep it that way.

13:04.920 --> 13:07.680
Listen, I know we put the brakes

13:07.680 --> 13:09.040
on your involvement with the

13:09.040 --> 13:11.560
GC-161 research a few months ago,

13:11.560 --> 13:13.440
but all that's about to change

13:13.440 --> 13:15.200
completely.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.600
From this point forward I want

13:16.600 --> 13:18.200
you to head up all our research

13:18.200 --> 13:20.640
into the GC-161 formula mechanism

13:20.640 --> 13:23.240
and I want to go full throttle.

13:23.240 --> 13:24.400
I need results

13:24.400 --> 13:25.680
and I need them quickly.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.320
Are you up to it, Mack?

13:27.320 --> 13:28.480
Are you kidding?

13:28.480 --> 13:29.400
Absolutely.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.040
Good.

13:30.040 --> 13:30.920
Because if you're not

13:30.920 --> 13:32.000
I know a number of researchers

13:32.000 --> 13:33.400
who would kill for the chance.

13:33.400 --> 13:34.480
Literally.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.680
No, no.

13:35.680 --> 13:37.040
I'm delighted.

13:37.040 --> 13:38.720
No, I'm honored.

13:38.720 --> 13:39.840
[Laughs]

13:39.840 --> 13:41.520
I just wonder if you could give

13:41.520 --> 13:43.440
the rd team a sense of what

13:43.440 --> 13:44.920
the potential application of the

13:44.920 --> 13:46.160
Chemical might be.

13:46.160 --> 13:47.480
The potential application

13:47.480 --> 13:48.840
of the Chemical, Mr. Mack,

13:48.840 --> 13:51.640
is none of your business.

13:51.640 --> 13:53.200
Although, if you must know

13:53.200 --> 13:54.200
I suppose I could tell you

13:54.200 --> 13:55.640
it has certain

13:55.640 --> 13:57.800
health benefit potential.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.560
It might take the concept of

14:01.560 --> 14:04.880
vitamin C to a higher level.

14:04.880 --> 14:05.680
[Sigh]

14:05.680 --> 14:06.480
Well, I couldn't be

14:06.480 --> 14:08.120
more thrilled, Ms. Atron.

14:08.120 --> 14:09.760
I won't let you down.

14:09.760 --> 14:10.400
Good.

14:10.400 --> 14:11.120
Now get back to work

14:11.120 --> 14:12.600
before I change my mind.

14:12.600 --> 14:13.560
[Chuckles]

14:13.560 --> 14:15.560
Oh. Thank you.

14:35.320 --> 14:37.320
 Face off. Face off.

14:48.920 --> 14:49.960
Hey, guys.

14:49.960 --> 14:52.320
I got to go.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.800
What's he so scared of?

14:54.800 --> 14:55.760
There's guilt dripping off

14:55.760 --> 14:56.400
that kid.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.400
Come on, let's follow him.

15:01.880 --> 15:04.840
Annie, we have to talk.

15:04.840 --> 15:06.360
And what's your problem?

15:06.360 --> 15:07.520
What's my problem?

15:07.520 --> 15:08.720
How about the fact that I manage

15:08.720 --> 15:10.320
to be surprisingly average?

15:10.320 --> 15:10.960
What?

15:10.960 --> 15:12.040
Or you were like me once

15:12.040 --> 15:13.360
when you were nine.

15:13.360 --> 15:15.160
How--how do you know--

15:15.160 --> 15:16.280
you knew how I felt about

15:16.280 --> 15:17.720
Scott and you still went out of

15:17.720 --> 15:18.560
your way to make me look like a

15:18.560 --> 15:20.200
complete idiot in front of him.

15:20.200 --> 15:21.080
But wait a second.

15:21.080 --> 15:21.840
How did you hear what I--

15:21.840 --> 15:22.680
Don't worry about it, Annie.

15:22.680 --> 15:25.680
I heard everything.

15:25.680 --> 15:28.160
That's really smart, Alex.

15:28.160 --> 15:29.400
Morphing in school

15:29.400 --> 15:30.680
and spying on me.

15:30.680 --> 15:31.960
Great.

15:31.960 --> 15:32.880
Don't turn your back on me,

15:32.880 --> 15:33.640
Annie.

15:33.640 --> 15:34.840
That was so completely horrible

15:34.840 --> 15:35.760
what you did.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.120
What were you even doing there?

15:37.120 --> 15:38.080
I just went to the school

15:38.080 --> 15:38.960
to bring you your bag.

15:38.960 --> 15:39.600
I didn't mean to cause

15:39.600 --> 15:41.320
a catastrophe in your love life.

15:41.320 --> 15:43.040
My bag? What bag?

15:43.040 --> 15:44.360
The bag Mom put your gym

15:44.360 --> 15:45.240
clothes in.

15:45.240 --> 15:46.720
Your flowered knapsack.

15:46.720 --> 15:47.760
I couldn't find anybody so I

15:47.760 --> 15:49.240
gave it to Scott to give to you.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.640
Didn't you get it?

15:50.640 --> 15:52.720
You mean, Scott has my bag?

15:52.720 --> 15:53.360
So what?

15:53.360 --> 15:54.040
You'll get it tomorrow.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.040
[Horn honking]

15:58.840 --> 15:59.920
Annie, the journal's in

15:59.920 --> 16:01.080
that bag.

16:01.080 --> 16:02.360
What do you mean?

16:02.360 --> 16:03.520
I took it back from you.

16:03.520 --> 16:04.520
I know, and I took it back

16:04.520 --> 16:06.240
from you and put it in my bag.

16:06.240 --> 16:07.400
Oh.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.320
Girls,

16:08.320 --> 16:10.480
I have some great news.

16:10.480 --> 16:11.720
You can tell us later, Dad.

16:11.720 --> 16:12.760
Alex left something at school

16:12.760 --> 16:13.400
and we have to go back

16:13.400 --> 16:15.400
and get it.

16:20.040 --> 16:21.200
Hey.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.600
Honey,

16:22.600 --> 16:24.600
guess who has some great news.

16:24.600 --> 16:25.400
Annie.

16:25.400 --> 16:26.400
No, me.

16:26.400 --> 16:27.040
Oh.

16:27.040 --> 16:28.040
I was promoted today to head

16:28.040 --> 16:29.400
up all the Plant's research

16:29.400 --> 16:31.240
into GC-161.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.520
George!

16:32.520 --> 16:33.160
[Laugh]

16:33.160 --> 16:34.560
We're going ahead full blast

16:34.560 --> 16:37.000
and Ms. Atron is looking to me

16:37.000 --> 16:38.080
for results.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.520
Oh, honey, congratulations.

16:40.520 --> 16:41.760
Does it mean a raise?

16:41.760 --> 16:43.360
Well, she didn't mention it

16:43.360 --> 16:45.200
but I guess it's a possibility.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.200
Well, that's okay we're doing

16:46.200 --> 16:47.240
just fine.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.400
A promotion.

16:49.400 --> 16:50.320
Well, I don't get

16:50.320 --> 16:51.840
a new title.

16:51.840 --> 16:52.480
Well, maybe by the end

16:52.480 --> 16:53.720
of the year.

16:53.720 --> 16:55.280
Does it mean longer hours?

16:55.280 --> 16:56.400
Much longer.

16:56.400 --> 16:57.080
Well, you know, George,

16:57.080 --> 16:58.320
that comes with success.

16:58.320 --> 16:58.960
[Laugh]

16:58.960 --> 16:59.920
More pressure?

16:59.920 --> 17:01.280
A lot more.

17:01.280 --> 17:02.400
Danielle's going to be looking

17:02.400 --> 17:03.800
over my shoulder every day

17:03.800 --> 17:05.560
just waiting for one screw up.

17:05.560 --> 17:07.240
And Vince will probably even be

17:07.240 --> 17:09.240
monitoring my phone calls.

17:12.119 --> 17:12.880
[Laughter]

17:12.880 --> 17:14.119
Sounds great, honey.

17:14.119 --> 17:16.079
Congratulations.

17:17.680 --> 17:18.319
[Cork pops]

17:18.319 --> 17:20.280
Oh! [Laughs]

17:26.960 --> 17:28.079
[Doorbell rings]

17:28.079 --> 17:30.400
Stop that. Just--

17:30.400 --> 17:31.240
For God's sakes,

17:31.240 --> 17:31.920
just keep your mind

17:31.920 --> 17:33.920
on your driving and quit eating.

17:37.240 --> 17:38.000
Hey, Raymond.

17:38.000 --> 17:38.640
Is Alex home?

17:38.640 --> 17:39.760
I got to talk to her right away.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.200
No, Alex and Annie went

17:41.200 --> 17:42.000
running back to the Junior High

17:42.000 --> 17:43.080
for some reason.

17:43.080 --> 17:43.960
Do you want to come in?

17:43.960 --> 17:45.960
Thanks, Mr. Mack. Got to go.

17:48.840 --> 17:49.520
He's going.

17:49.520 --> 17:50.600
Okay, go, go.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.560
Move, move, move.

17:56.200 --> 17:56.880
It's all right, Vince.

17:56.880 --> 17:57.680
We'll get him. don't worry.

17:57.680 --> 17:59.680
But you're a good hockey...

18:08.120 --> 18:10.640
Oh, there he is.

18:10.640 --> 18:11.600
Okay, I'll get it.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.800
No, Annie, I'll get it.

18:13.800 --> 18:14.680
Haven't you done enough

18:14.680 --> 18:16.640
for one day?

18:19.640 --> 18:20.720
Hey, Scott, what's up?

18:20.720 --> 18:23.680
Not much.

18:23.680 --> 18:24.440
Whose bag is that?

18:24.440 --> 18:25.440
Oh, it's Alex's.

18:25.440 --> 18:26.240
I was supposed to give it to her

18:26.240 --> 18:28.240
but I forgot.

18:30.800 --> 18:31.560
Maybe you shouldn't be doing

18:31.560 --> 18:32.200
that.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.200
Please. Just for a second.

18:36.160 --> 18:37.080
Wow.

18:37.080 --> 18:39.240
[Laughs]

18:39.240 --> 18:39.960
Oh, you're not gonna

18:39.960 --> 18:41.360
believe this.

18:41.360 --> 18:43.280
Today I saw Scott and I almost

18:43.280 --> 18:44.720
morphed into a puddle.

18:44.720 --> 18:45.760
Think she has a crush on you

18:45.760 --> 18:46.480
or what?

18:46.480 --> 18:47.280
Well, I think you should put

18:47.280 --> 18:48.000
that back, Kel.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Oh, just a little more.

18:49.000 --> 18:49.800
I'm not going to tell anyone.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.200
Excuse me,

18:51.200 --> 18:52.280
can I have that back please?

18:52.280 --> 18:54.000
Well, look who's here.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.040
Give it back.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.360
But I haven't finished

18:56.360 --> 18:57.200
reading it yet.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.320
It's not yours to read.

18:58.320 --> 18:59.400
Give it back.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.360
Come on, Kelly.

19:03.560 --> 19:04.640
Give it back to her,

19:04.640 --> 19:06.720
you underachiever.

19:06.720 --> 19:07.360
Come on, guys.

19:07.360 --> 19:08.120
You're going to have to ask

19:08.120 --> 19:08.760
nicer than that.

19:08.760 --> 19:09.640
Do not make us

19:09.640 --> 19:10.640
force it out of you.

19:10.640 --> 19:11.600
Please give it back to her.

19:11.600 --> 19:12.640
Give it back to her.

19:12.640 --> 19:14.040
What, so give it back to her.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.240
Oh, man.

19:15.240 --> 19:17.920
I don't have trouble--

19:17.920 --> 19:18.880
Well, I think you're--

19:18.880 --> 19:19.760
Oh. Got it.

19:19.760 --> 19:20.960
Oh, yes.

19:20.960 --> 19:21.600
Check it out, I got it.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.080
Thanks, Ray.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.240
Ray, look out!

19:25.240 --> 19:27.240
Whoa!

19:28.400 --> 19:29.040
Are you okay?

19:29.040 --> 19:30.440
This book seems awfully

19:30.440 --> 19:31.600
important to all of you.

19:31.600 --> 19:32.680
It's mine.

19:32.680 --> 19:33.800
Top secret.

19:33.800 --> 19:34.920
[Laughs]

19:34.920 --> 19:35.880
You know this looks like it

19:35.880 --> 19:37.360
might be interesting reading.

19:37.360 --> 19:38.800
Hey. That's private property.

19:38.800 --> 19:39.720
Give it back to her.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.960
Finders keepers.

19:41.960 --> 19:43.240
Isn't that what you kids say?

19:43.240 --> 19:44.640
What are you doing here?

19:44.640 --> 19:45.800
You may be dressed like

19:45.800 --> 19:47.200
an exterminator but I happen to

19:47.200 --> 19:47.960
know that you're Vince

19:47.960 --> 19:49.720
from the Plant.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.840
My name is not Vince.

19:51.840 --> 19:52.800
What's going on, Vince?

19:52.800 --> 19:54.360
Dave.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.080
Hey, watch it, Vince!

19:55.080 --> 19:55.960
I've got you covered.

19:55.960 --> 19:58.560
[Yelling]

19:58.560 --> 20:01.480
[Laughter]

20:13.960 --> 20:15.360
Thanks, Ray.

20:15.360 --> 20:17.360
Any time.

20:19.480 --> 20:20.400
Can we put this away

20:20.400 --> 20:21.160
now please?

20:21.160 --> 20:21.800
We can't--

20:21.800 --> 20:23.080
Hey, girls,

20:23.080 --> 20:24.040
your father has something

20:24.040 --> 20:24.920
he wants to tell you.

20:24.920 --> 20:25.920
Oh, it won't mean anything

20:25.920 --> 20:26.680
to them.

20:26.680 --> 20:27.600
It's just that I got

20:27.600 --> 20:29.080
this big promotion today.

20:29.080 --> 20:30.520
Danielle told me I'm gonna

20:30.520 --> 20:31.720
head up all the research

20:31.720 --> 20:34.600
on the GC-161 project.

20:34.600 --> 20:35.680
[Both] What?

20:35.680 --> 20:37.040
You probably don't remember

20:37.040 --> 20:39.360
but GC-161 is the Chemical

20:39.360 --> 20:41.280
I was working on when--

20:41.280 --> 20:42.200
We remember, Dad.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.920
That's terrific.

20:43.920 --> 20:44.840
It is?

20:44.840 --> 20:46.640
Yes, it is.

20:46.640 --> 20:47.880
Maybe I could help you

20:47.880 --> 20:49.040
work on it here.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.800
That's a great idea.

20:50.800 --> 20:51.880
I mean, it is top secret

20:51.880 --> 20:52.960
but I guess I can trust

20:52.960 --> 20:53.840
my own daughter.

20:53.840 --> 20:54.480
[Laughter]

20:54.480 --> 20:55.960
I'm very excited about this.

20:55.960 --> 20:56.880
Very excited.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.080
Nice going, Dad.

20:58.080 --> 21:00.040
Yeah, Dad, congratulations.

21:03.600 --> 21:05.120
It's amazing how Annie

21:05.120 --> 21:06.840
manages to get so interested

21:06.840 --> 21:08.840
in my work.

21:10.960 --> 21:13.280
That was pretty close today.

21:13.280 --> 21:14.280
No kidding.

21:14.280 --> 21:15.920
You were about five seconds away

21:15.920 --> 21:16.760
from seeing the rest of your

21:16.760 --> 21:17.680
life from the bottom

21:17.680 --> 21:19.000
of a microscope.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.120
So I guess the journal

21:20.120 --> 21:21.800
was a bad idea.

21:21.800 --> 21:23.240
Alex, if you had left it

21:23.240 --> 21:23.920
in this room like you were

21:23.920 --> 21:24.600
supposed to,

21:24.600 --> 21:26.200
everything would have been okay.

21:26.200 --> 21:27.040
Now I'm going to have to go back

21:27.040 --> 21:29.000
to testing you myself everyday

21:29.000 --> 21:29.680
and I know how much

21:29.680 --> 21:31.680
you hate that.

21:33.800 --> 21:34.600
Good night.

21:34.600 --> 21:36.600
Night.

21:51.320 --> 21:52.440
Thursday.

21:52.440 --> 21:53.720
Decided to start my own diary

21:53.720 --> 21:54.680
since Annie's science one

21:54.680 --> 21:56.200
almost got me in big trouble.

21:56.200 --> 21:57.320
So it's back to her

21:57.320 --> 21:58.840
testing me again.

21:58.840 --> 22:00.160
Some little sisters get to have

22:00.160 --> 22:01.240
these great heart to heart talks

22:01.240 --> 22:02.840
with their older sisters.

22:02.840 --> 22:04.400
Me, I get my blood pressure

22:04.400 --> 22:05.240
checked and I get my zappers

22:05.240 --> 22:07.240
measured.

22:14.080 --> 22:15.320
But if that's what it takes for

22:15.320 --> 22:17.520
Annie to pay attention to me,

22:17.520 --> 22:19.480
I can live with it.
