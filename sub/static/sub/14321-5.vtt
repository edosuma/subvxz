[narrator]
Previously on X-Men...

00:03.583 --> 00:04.958
[Joe] Look, Moira!

00:05.708 --> 00:06.833
[Moira] I can see him

00:06.833 --> 00:07.875
[Joe] What's happening?

00:09.750 --> 00:12.458
-What is it?
-Come quickly!
I need your help!

00:15.000 --> 00:19.208
He's young and scared.
And he has no idea
how powerful he is.

00:19.625 --> 00:21.250
-Joe.
-Moira?

00:21.375 --> 00:24.333
-Kevin's out!
-Well, put him back!

00:24.458 --> 00:27.458
You could talk to the boy.
That's all he wants.

00:28.125 --> 00:30.833
What haven't you told me
about this mutant?

00:30.833 --> 00:31.833
I don't know how he--

00:33.083 --> 00:36.250
Kevin, please,
you've got to come back
with me!

00:36.250 --> 00:37.500
Never.

00:37.500 --> 00:41.250
[inaudible]

00:42.500 --> 00:45.458
-Who are you looking for?
-My father!

00:46.458 --> 00:50.583
-Don't touch him! He is my son!
-[Professor X] Your son?

00:54.583 --> 00:56.291
Charles, I'm sinking!

00:58.875 --> 01:00.750
Hey! Stop it!

01:09.250 --> 01:10.875
He's down there somewhere.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.208
They can't stop me.

01:12.875 --> 01:14.833
I am going to find my father.

01:15.875 --> 01:16.875
[theme music playing]

02:15.833 --> 02:17.125
[moaning]

02:19.333 --> 02:22.083
[Rogue] Wolverine!
What did he do to you?

02:22.208 --> 02:24.250
I'm fine.
I don't need your help.

02:25.958 --> 02:27.125
[vomiting]

02:29.125 --> 02:30.583
You wanna talk about it?

02:30.708 --> 02:34.583
No. Not now, not ever.

02:34.583 --> 02:37.250
It's just a matter of time
before someone gets hurt.

02:37.375 --> 02:42.000
Moira, don't worry.
We will stop Kevin
before that happens.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.875
Might I suggest
we find Proteus' father,
Joseph MacTaggert,

02:45.875 --> 02:47.458
and prepare
to confront him there.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.416
Yes. And if needed,

02:50.416 --> 02:53.833
we can try to afford
Mr. MacTaggert some protection.

02:53.958 --> 02:55.583
Joe won't accept your help.

02:56.416 --> 02:58.375
He's the least of our worries.

03:10.375 --> 03:12.333
[people chattering]

03:14.875 --> 03:18.333
Father!
Who are those children?

03:18.333 --> 03:21.375
You don't understand, Maeve.
I really care.

03:21.833 --> 03:23.708
I'm a lad
on the way up, Maeve.

03:23.708 --> 03:25.250
I think we should save Wales,

03:26.250 --> 03:28.250
even the whole of Britain,
if that's what it takes.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.750
Oh, it's a keen mind
you have, Thomas.

03:30.750 --> 03:32.583
You'll go far in politics.

03:32.583 --> 03:35.166
With me, however,
you'll not get far at all.

03:35.166 --> 03:36.166
Good night to you.

03:40.416 --> 03:41.708
No!

03:43.833 --> 03:46.708
[Xavier] MacTaggert's
campaign office
should be in the next block.

03:52.958 --> 03:55.208
He's here. Over there!

03:57.375 --> 03:58.375
[Professor X] Proteus!

04:06.291 --> 04:08.000
[Thomas screaming]

04:11.125 --> 04:12.875
What is that? What's that?

04:16.625 --> 04:19.583
Kevin! It's time to come home.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.166
Can't you understand, Mother?
I'm going to see him!

04:23.291 --> 04:26.458
Your father can't help you.
He won't help you.

04:26.583 --> 04:29.166
That's not true!
You never gave him a chance.

04:29.166 --> 04:32.458
It'll be okay, Kevin.
Just listen to your mama.

04:32.583 --> 04:36.416
No! No one
can keep me from him!

04:44.333 --> 04:45.250
[people screaming]

04:45.375 --> 04:47.458
Just leave me alone!

04:47.583 --> 04:48.750
I wish I could!

05:04.458 --> 05:05.458
[Rogue grunting]

05:05.458 --> 05:07.708
This kid has some temper.

05:17.875 --> 05:18.833
He won't listen.

05:19.958 --> 05:21.833
And if Kevin does reach Joe,

05:21.833 --> 05:24.875
he's going to find out
that Joe left me
because of him!

05:24.875 --> 05:27.250
Joe didn't want a mutant
for a child.

05:27.375 --> 05:28.833
It's gonna make him crazy.

05:28.958 --> 05:30.708
There'll be no way
to stop him, short of...

05:30.708 --> 05:33.500
Destroying him?
We will find another way.

05:35.875 --> 05:36.875
[birds chirping]

05:38.708 --> 05:40.625
He'll know where my father is.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Huh?

05:47.458 --> 05:48.458
[screaming]

05:51.583 --> 05:54.958
Moira wanted custody.
Kevin is not
my problem anymore.

05:55.416 --> 05:57.125
What do you want me to do?
Put him on telly?

05:57.250 --> 06:01.250
No, Mr. MacTaggert.
Just talk to the boy.

06:01.250 --> 06:05.416
He doesn't know
why you left him.
Tell him the truth.

06:05.416 --> 06:08.000
Are you nuts?
The vote's tomorrow.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.875
There are cameras
everywhere I go.

06:09.875 --> 06:12.208
I don't want people
to remember I'm divorced,

06:12.583 --> 06:14.833
much less find out
I'm the father
of some sort of...

06:14.833 --> 06:19.416
Son, Joe! He's a boy.
And he needs his father.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.625
Well, tell him
that Xavier's his father.

06:21.625 --> 06:23.583
You always
wanted it that way.

06:23.583 --> 06:25.333
You fool, MacTaggert!

06:25.333 --> 06:27.708
He's coming for you,
whether you like it or not!

06:27.875 --> 06:29.833
Don't you think
I want to help the lad?

06:30.333 --> 06:32.458
Remember, Moira,
he's mine too.

06:32.583 --> 06:36.958
I appreciate your offer
of protection,
but I have my own.

06:41.333 --> 06:43.166
Father. Father!

06:47.708 --> 06:48.708
[doorbell ringing]

06:54.833 --> 06:56.291
[footsteps approaching]

07:04.625 --> 07:05.875
[children laughing]

07:23.458 --> 07:24.833
Where is my father?

07:44.500 --> 07:45.500
[gasps]

07:51.833 --> 07:53.500
[Joe] If the boy shows up,

07:53.500 --> 07:55.583
keep him out of sight
until after the vote.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.458
If you don't, all our work
will be for nothing.

07:59.458 --> 08:01.000
[man] How bad is he?

08:01.000 --> 08:02.375
How should I know? I haven't

08:02.375 --> 08:03.875
seen him
since he was crawling.

08:04.500 --> 08:08.583
[scoffs] Ought to just let
Proteus get a good look
at dear old dad.

08:09.583 --> 08:11.458
How much trouble
can one boy be?

08:11.875 --> 08:13.458
And don't get careless.

08:18.708 --> 08:20.875
Professor,
we got to change shifts.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.958
I need a shower
after babysitting this slime.

08:35.625 --> 08:37.458
[supporters cheering]

08:43.000 --> 08:45.625
Joe MacTaggert.
Appreciate your support.

08:47.458 --> 08:49.166
Hope you'll be with me
on election day.

08:50.583 --> 08:53.291
MacTaggert, how you doing?
Good man.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.875
It's in the bag, Bill.

08:58.458 --> 09:01.166
I don't go along
with abandoning kids.

09:01.166 --> 09:04.500
[Beast] "Political campaigns
are designedly
made to paralyze

09:04.500 --> 09:08.000

09:08.000 --> 09:09.458
James Harvey Robinson.

09:09.458 --> 09:11.125
Just remember to report

09:11.125 --> 09:12.583
the least sign
of a disturbance.

09:12.583 --> 09:14.000
Is that understood?

09:14.000 --> 09:15.583
[Beast]
Certainly, Professor.

09:15.708 --> 09:17.291
Logan, are you there?

09:17.416 --> 09:18.375
Are you all right?

09:19.625 --> 09:23.416
Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.
No angry boy clouds
in the basement.

09:23.416 --> 09:24.583
Hold it!

09:28.875 --> 09:30.458
All clear.

09:30.458 --> 09:32.625
Are you holding up
okay, Logan?

09:32.750 --> 09:35.333
Worry about that kid
if I find him first!

09:43.416 --> 09:48.958
[supporters screaming]

09:52.625 --> 09:56.708
Thank you! I take that
as support not just for me,

09:57.291 --> 09:59.125
but for my platform

09:59.125 --> 10:03.583
for every family in Scotland,
for our children!

10:03.708 --> 10:08.708
Guess he likes children
if they ain't his.
I've seen that happen before.

10:09.458 --> 10:12.125
My own flesh and blood,
a mutant!

10:12.250 --> 10:14.000
Daddy, please!

10:14.166 --> 10:17.375
You're a disgrace!
I'm ashamed
to be seen with you!

10:18.458 --> 10:22.125
You ain't my daughter!
Not anymore.

10:23.333 --> 10:27.458
Daddy! Daddy, please!

10:34.291 --> 10:38.125
I wonder, Professor, if Proteus
might not wish to avoid so
public a location--

10:38.125 --> 10:41.250
He's here!
Proteus is in the hall!

10:42.875 --> 10:47.875
I know that without
my children,
I would simply cease to exist.

10:47.875 --> 10:52.208
They're my life.
Our children
are more than our future.

10:52.708 --> 10:53.500
They are...

Father, it's Kevin!

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
[people screaming]

11:03.958 --> 11:05.375
Careful, sugar.

11:05.458 --> 11:07.875
Mr. MacTaggert
may not recognize you.

11:10.375 --> 11:13.208
I told you, stay away!

11:15.458 --> 11:18.875
Moira, stay back!
I'll help them.
Where are you, Logan?

11:19.000 --> 11:20.166
[Professor X] Wolverine!

from happening!

11:48.625 --> 11:49.875
That's no boy!

11:51.958 --> 11:56.000
Talk to me, Kevin.
Stop fighting us
and I'll listen.

11:56.458 --> 11:57.958
Where is my father?

11:58.250 --> 12:01.750
You frightened him, Kevin!
He ran away because...

12:01.750 --> 12:04.125
Shut up!
You kept him from me!

12:08.583 --> 12:09.583
Stop!

12:11.375 --> 12:12.375
Listen...

12:22.583 --> 12:23.708
[sceaming]

12:24.208 --> 12:25.333
Get them off of me!

12:37.750 --> 12:38.708

anywhere, Beast.

12:41.166 --> 12:42.166
Hold on, Chuck!

12:49.208 --> 12:51.250
Better talk to your boy,
Professor.

12:51.958 --> 12:54.208
'Cause he ain't
listening to any of us.

12:57.625 --> 13:00.833
[Professor X] Kevin.
Kevin MacTaggert.

13:02.458 --> 13:03.875
[Rogue sighs]
That's more like it.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.083
Kevin, please listen.

13:06.083 --> 13:07.583
Why?

13:07.583 --> 13:09.750
I sense that beneath
your anger

13:09.750 --> 13:11.833
there's a yearning,
a reaching out.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.000
I am a doctor.

13:13.625 --> 13:16.833
Let me help you understand
what it is you seek.

13:16.958 --> 13:20.833
What I want is my father.
If you want to help me,
bring him to me!

13:21.625 --> 13:24.250
My father wants me!
Get out of the way!

13:25.375 --> 13:26.958
[X-Men screaming]

13:26.958 --> 13:28.333
[people screaming]

13:33.125 --> 13:37.625
Fascinating.
His power seems limited
only by his imagination.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.416
And that temper.

13:39.416 --> 13:41.500
Stopping him
is beyond our power.

13:41.500 --> 13:44.875
We must continue to try
to reason with him.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.708
No, Charles. You've tried.
It is I that must
do something now.

13:49.875 --> 13:51.250
Moira! Wait!

13:51.250 --> 13:52.875
Do you wish me
to bring her back?

13:55.416 --> 13:58.083
If only I had more time
with him.

13:59.583 --> 14:03.583
Even with more time,
Professor, what could
we possibly accomplish?

14:04.125 --> 14:06.333
Proteus attacks
with the speed of thought.

14:06.333 --> 14:09.583
Though a young man,
he has the immature
emotions of a child.

14:09.708 --> 14:11.500
I say we nail him.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.000
What are you talking about?

14:13.875 --> 14:16.583
-And by the way, when he was
tossing us around,
where were you hiding?

14:16.708 --> 14:18.750
Back off, cornpone.

14:18.875 --> 14:20.875
Your anger serves
no purpose, Rogue.

14:20.875 --> 14:23.375
Wolverine could not
prevent his hesitation.

14:23.458 --> 14:25.625
What's that supposed to mean?

14:25.750 --> 14:29.750
Only that there's no emotion
harder to control
than a paralyzing fear.

14:29.875 --> 14:31.750
We have all experienced it.

14:31.750 --> 14:33.875
But it must be even worse
for you,

14:33.875 --> 14:35.583
who has never felt it before.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.833
You saying I'm a coward,
Blue Boy?

14:38.958 --> 14:40.000
Stop it, both of you!

14:40.500 --> 14:43.583
We cannot afford petty fights
among ourselves!

14:43.708 --> 14:47.166
Moira feels responsible
for Proteus' actions.

14:47.166 --> 14:49.333
And she's gone
to do something.

14:49.458 --> 14:53.291
She may try to destroy
her own son.

14:53.291 --> 14:56.000
Do you know
what that means to her?
To me?

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
Help me make sure
that it doesn't happen.

15:00.583 --> 15:02.750
...where, earlier
this evening,

15:03.291 --> 15:06.416
MacTaggert was victim
of a vicious physical attack.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
An attack he says
was instigated by
his opponent, Bill Wallace.

15:11.291 --> 15:14.166
While the opposition
denies any involvement,

15:14.166 --> 15:17.125
sources close
to the MacTaggert campaign
tell me...

15:18.500 --> 15:19.875
[audience murmuring]

15:22.583 --> 15:24.333
[woman] What is this?
What's going on?

15:25.166 --> 15:26.333
[man]
What's happening here?

15:27.166 --> 15:30.583
Good evening. Thank you all
for having me here tonight.

15:30.583 --> 15:32.875
Of course,
after this afternoon,

15:32.875 --> 15:34.750
I'm thankful
to be anywhere tonight.

15:34.750 --> 15:36.750
[everyone laughing]

15:37.583 --> 15:40.291
Now where was I? Oh, yes.

15:40.875 --> 15:42.625
Telling you
what you already know

15:42.625 --> 15:44.458
and pretending
I just thought it up.

15:44.583 --> 15:47.833
Mmm, that boy's
slick as hog fat.

15:47.958 --> 15:52.375
The only real hope
for a solution to all this
is there, behind that podium.

15:52.708 --> 15:55.166
But MacTaggert
decided long ago

15:55.166 --> 15:58.166
that his career
was more important
than his son.

15:58.833 --> 16:00.500
A real prince.

16:00.500 --> 16:02.958
And I have a personal stake
in that future,

16:03.083 --> 16:05.833
my love for my children.

16:05.958 --> 16:07.875
[audience cheering]

16:08.458 --> 16:09.833
[Proteus screaming]

16:09.833 --> 16:11.083
[people exclaiming]

16:11.083 --> 16:12.583
[Kevin] Father! Everybody says

16:12.583 --> 16:14.125
you don't want to see me.

16:14.250 --> 16:17.458
But that's not true!
It can't be true!

16:18.875 --> 16:20.458
Here now. A joke's a joke.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
[Wolverine grunting]

16:26.708 --> 16:30.333
You're not real!
You're a trick to ruin me!

16:30.458 --> 16:31.416
[audience screaming]

16:33.583 --> 16:34.833
[man] Let me out of here!

16:41.208 --> 16:42.375
[screaming]

16:43.000 --> 16:43.875
Get away!

16:44.000 --> 16:46.125
Rogue! Beast! Stand aside!

16:46.250 --> 16:47.291
Say what?

16:47.416 --> 16:48.958
Let them talk.

16:54.083 --> 16:55.375
Don't you know me, Father?

16:57.250 --> 16:58.583
Somebody do something!

17:00.000 --> 17:01.208
Does this help?

17:01.333 --> 17:02.458
What on earth...

17:02.583 --> 17:05.708
It's me, Father. It's Kevin.

17:05.708 --> 17:06.583
It can't be!

17:06.708 --> 17:08.750
Father, I need you!

17:08.875 --> 17:10.708
No, no, get away!

17:10.708 --> 17:11.833
But, Father...

17:11.833 --> 17:13.875
Guards! Darnley! Security!

17:13.875 --> 17:15.375
Somebody get him!

17:16.291 --> 17:17.875
No! Don't!

17:18.583 --> 17:20.875
Kevin! Kevin, listen!

17:27.458 --> 17:28.625
[people screaming]

17:36.416 --> 17:39.458
Come on, kid,
your old man's no saint,

17:39.458 --> 17:41.625
but that's no reason
to trash this dump.

17:41.750 --> 17:45.500
If you don't like Xavier,
maybe you can talk to me.

17:47.166 --> 17:48.708
[Wolverine screaming]

17:48.708 --> 17:50.958
Charles, Banshee's brought
the one thing

17:50.958 --> 17:52.333
that seems to affect Kevin.

17:52.458 --> 17:54.625
Used at low power,
it helped control him.

17:54.750 --> 17:55.833
At full power, it might...

17:57.250 --> 18:00.083
If you can't stop him,
I'll have to!

18:00.083 --> 18:01.750
Moira, there's no choice!

18:01.750 --> 18:06.250
Moira, wait!
I have to try one last time.

18:06.250 --> 18:07.750
Charles, no! It's too late!

18:09.875 --> 18:15.333
Kevin! Kevin, listen to me.
My name is Charles Xavier.

18:16.333 --> 18:17.625
You know me now.

18:17.875 --> 18:20.833
I've come to help you
face your rage,

18:20.833 --> 18:22.166
and face it you must!

18:22.875 --> 18:25.000
Possess me
as you have others, Kevin.

18:25.166 --> 18:29.500
Look inside my mind
and see that I know your pain.

18:30.375 --> 18:33.000
Otherwise
it will consume you.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.750
I can get you through this,
if that's what you want.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.750
It is what I want.

18:41.875 --> 18:45.083
Give me your hand, son,
and come here.

18:51.583 --> 18:53.458
I have helped
many like you, Kevin.

18:53.833 --> 18:58.125
With time, you will learn
to master your powers,
and this rage.

18:58.583 --> 19:01.875
But only if you learn to trust

19:01.875 --> 19:04.708
those who love you,
mother and father.

19:15.875 --> 19:18.625
Kevin? Darling.

19:19.375 --> 19:20.500
Kevin?

19:22.750 --> 19:25.833
Son, is that really you?

19:25.958 --> 19:27.875
It is, Father.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.583
Aye, child,
though I've no right
to the name.

19:31.458 --> 19:33.125
Can you forgive me?

19:33.875 --> 19:35.375
Go ahead, Kevin.

19:56.875 --> 19:58.833
[pieces beeping]

20:04.625 --> 20:05.625
[beeping]

20:08.875 --> 20:11.250
His progress is remarkable.

20:11.375 --> 20:13.875
[Banshee] Aye.
Though it's hard-fought,
indeed.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.166
I feel much better with him
fighting his teacher

20:16.166 --> 20:18.083
than taking on the whole world.

20:18.208 --> 20:22.166
I am sure Mr. MacTaggert
is equally thankful,
and relieved.

20:25.208 --> 20:27.875
Whatever Chuck did
in there, it worked.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.166
I don't know
how he faced that thing.
He never loses his cool.

20:32.166 --> 20:33.458
Forget it, hon.

20:33.458 --> 20:34.875
In our business,
we all get shook up

20:34.875 --> 20:36.416
every now and again.

20:36.875 --> 20:38.208
I don't.
