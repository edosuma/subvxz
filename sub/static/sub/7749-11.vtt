WEBVTT

00:00.800 --> 00:04.122
ALICIA:
400, 500, 600,

00:04.170 --> 00:07.799
700, 800, 900, 1,000.

00:07.840 --> 00:10.434
That's $5,000.

00:10.470 --> 00:13.030
MAN: The bank bag.
Where's the bank bag?

00:26.420 --> 00:29.389
Sign here.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.455
Are you the one
going to prison?

00:31.490 --> 00:32.696
No.

00:32.730 --> 00:35.051
Then what the hell you doing?

00:36.170 --> 00:38.195
Good.

00:38.230 --> 00:39.788
Pay for the hotel
room, room service

00:39.840 --> 00:41.535
and my dry cleaning.

00:41.570 --> 00:44.061
Six hours of consultation,

00:44.110 --> 00:45.509
which starts now.

00:45.540 --> 00:46.837
You can go.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.529
I was staying.

00:48.580 --> 00:49.774
No, you weren't staying.

00:49.810 --> 00:51.277
No women.

00:58.350 --> 00:59.510
I'll call you.

00:59.560 --> 01:00.584
Yeah, he'll call you.

01:00.620 --> 01:02.178
Like his first day of school.

01:03.830 --> 01:05.422
(phone rings)

01:05.460 --> 01:06.791
MARISSA:
Dad, Dad!

01:06.830 --> 01:08.525
Calm down.
We're on our way.

01:12.870 --> 01:15.134
So, four years?

01:15.170 --> 01:17.138
Yeah.

01:17.170 --> 01:20.105
Two with good behavior.

01:20.140 --> 01:22.745
You go for three weeks
to Statesville first.

01:22.780 --> 01:25.271
It's a maximum
security prison.

01:25.310 --> 01:26.811
That's where D.O.C.
will classify you

01:26.850 --> 01:29.739
either as minimum,
medium or maximum.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.452
Well, I'll end up
in minimum, right?

01:32.490 --> 01:35.482
Maybe. There's
overcrowding these days.

01:35.520 --> 01:39.251
So some minimum inmates
end up In maXImum.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.825
You need to prepare
for maximum.

01:41.860 --> 01:44.169
You've done time?

01:44.200 --> 01:46.361
(clears throat)
A week in County.

01:46.400 --> 01:47.867
A week where-where
guys are waItIng

01:47.900 --> 01:49.208
for their mommies
to bail them out?

01:49.240 --> 01:50.707
Prison is different.

01:50.740 --> 01:52.708
Half the inmates are
never gomg home.

01:52.740 --> 01:54.469
Now, tell me, Mr. Agos.

01:54.510 --> 01:56.501
Do you think guys like that
are gonna hesitate to beat

01:56.550 --> 01:58.541
the crap out of you for looking
at them the wrong way?

01:58.580 --> 01:59.842
Look, you don't need
to scare me straight.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.438
I get it.

02:01.480 --> 02:03.539
I just need tips
on what to do.

02:03.590 --> 02:05.444
Sure. You want a tip?

02:05.490 --> 02:08.209
I got one.

02:08.260 --> 02:10.148
Here, put it on.

02:10.190 --> 02:12.522
'Cause if you don't
start paying attention,

02:12.560 --> 02:14.528
your cellies are gonna
make you their prom queen.

02:14.560 --> 02:15.891
Okay.

02:15.930 --> 02:18.296
No. Not okay.

02:18.330 --> 02:20.639
Shut and listen.

02:20.670 --> 02:22.865
What are you gonna do
to protect yourself, Mr. Agos?

02:22.910 --> 02:24.935
Any family
or friends doing time?

02:24.970 --> 02:26.870
No.

02:26.910 --> 02:29.378
No one who can vouch
for you on the msrde?

02:29.410 --> 02:30.877
No.

02:30.910 --> 02:33.310
That's your tip.

02:33.350 --> 02:35.375
Okay? Find a friend.

02:35.420 --> 02:36.910
A white guy.

02:36.950 --> 02:40.249
There's no such thing
as a post-racial lockup.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.383
Someone jumps off on your block,
you got to run with your own.

02:42.430 --> 02:44.421
Because if something
happens to you,

02:44.460 --> 02:46.257
white defends white

02:46.300 --> 02:47.426
and black defends black.

02:47.460 --> 02:48.950
Got it_?
I got It.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.321
Good. Now, let's find you
a white friend.

02:51.370 --> 02:54.237
(distant bell tolling)

02:54.270 --> 02:56.659
(cell phone rings)

02:59.980 --> 03:01.402
Yeah?

03:01.440 --> 03:03.647
CARY:
Kalinda, I need your help.

03:03.680 --> 03:04.874
I'm on my way to you.

03:04.910 --> 03:06.218
No.

03:06.250 --> 03:07.547
The prison consultant
is advising me

03:07.580 --> 03:08.911
to find a convict inside.

03:08.950 --> 03:10.247
Someone I can trust.

03:10.290 --> 03:11.689
In Statesville?
Yeah.

03:11.720 --> 03:13.381
And one other thing.

03:13.420 --> 03:16.856
He's suggesting it be
someone Caucasian.

03:16.890 --> 03:19.290
Right. I get it.

03:19.330 --> 03:21.753
Anyone in mind?

03:24.730 --> 03:27.938
I'll call you back, okay?

03:27.970 --> 03:30.006
Is that your girlfriend?
Yeah.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.769
But it's complicated.

03:31.810 --> 03:34.529
You're gonna want
to uncomplicate that today.

03:34.580 --> 03:35.706
(laughs)

03:35.740 --> 03:38.709
I'm serious.

03:57.770 --> 04:00.364
*

04:07.580 --> 04:09.798
(violin playing off-key nearby)

04:26.730 --> 04:29.494
This isn't about me.

04:29.530 --> 04:31.760
This is about Cary.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.998
A lot of things about Cary

04:35.040 --> 04:37.031
end up being about you, Kalinda.

04:37.070 --> 04:39.038
I know, but, uh,

04:39.070 --> 04:41.709
he needs help in Statesville.

04:41.740 --> 04:45.744
For the first three weeks,
someone to watch his back.

04:45.780 --> 04:48.419
Kalinda, last time

04:48.450 --> 04:50.384
we stood right here,

04:50.420 --> 04:51.910
you threatened me.

04:53.390 --> 04:55.711
Eh, my mistake.

04:55.760 --> 04:57.921
Even worse than threatening me,

04:57.960 --> 04:59.928
you threatened my son.

04:59.960 --> 05:02.963
I'm sorry, sir.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.868
But that had nothing
to do with Cary.

05:06.900 --> 05:08.834
You know, he has
never wavered once

05:08.870 --> 05:11.839
in his support for you, sir.

05:11.870 --> 05:15.476
All he asks is that you help him
find someone on the inside.

05:15.510 --> 05:17.478
That's all.

05:17.510 --> 05:20.343
Someone, uh... white.

05:20.380 --> 05:22.814
(laughs)

05:34.430 --> 05:36.728
(door closes)

05:57.620 --> 06:00.418
You're gonna get a
call in a few hours.

06:00.460 --> 06:03.884
Or a few days.

06:03.930 --> 06:06.080
I need you to take it.

06:06.130 --> 06:08.018
From?

06:08.060 --> 06:09.766
Someone.

06:09.800 --> 06:12.064
You're asking for
a favor, Kalinda.

06:12.100 --> 06:15.934
I'm asking for one in return.

06:15.970 --> 06:17.961
You want Cary to have a friend?

06:18.010 --> 06:20.934
Say yes.

06:20.980 --> 06:23.448
Yeah.

06:31.850 --> 06:32.953
Hello?

06:32.990 --> 06:34.457
Yeah, this is Ray.

06:34.490 --> 06:36.117
Who's the guy coming in?

06:38.960 --> 06:41.497
Cary Agos.

06:41.530 --> 06:43.498
Oh, yeah. He's the lavwer
caught with Trey Wagner.

06:43.530 --> 06:44.827
Yes.
With the export train?

06:44.870 --> 06:45.996
Yes, that's right.

06:46.030 --> 06:47.759
When's his self-surrender date?

06:47.800 --> 06:50.166
Uh, his sentencing
is at 5:00 today...

06:50.210 --> 06:53.008
Sorry, what-what
did you just say?

06:53.040 --> 06:55.907
That'll get him here
by 8:00 am. the next day.

06:55.940 --> 06:57.441
I can meet his transport.

06:57.480 --> 06:58.799
Yeah, no, you said something

06:58.850 --> 07:00.010
about Trey's export train.

07:00.050 --> 07:02.883
The $1.3 million in heroin.

07:02.920 --> 07:05.047
You mean "import," right?

07:05.090 --> 07:06.182
No, Trey and his buddies
were trying

07:06.220 --> 07:08.017
to get into their own business.

07:08.060 --> 07:10.187
Selling to someone in Toronto.

07:14.960 --> 07:16.791
Cary was accused of conspiring
with Bishop's crew

07:16.830 --> 07:18.559
to get the drugs into the city.

07:18.600 --> 07:19.794
But he couldn't have.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.933
Why? What do you mean?

07:21.970 --> 07:23.631
Because the drugs were
already here.

07:23.670 --> 07:25.809
Who said that?

07:25.840 --> 07:27.603
Someone who was arrested
wrth Trey Wagner.

07:27.640 --> 07:29.779
He said the drugs were
being readied for export,

07:29.810 --> 07:31.903
but Cary was charged
with giving advice on

07:31.950 --> 07:34.669
how to import drugs,
not export them.

07:36.120 --> 07:38.486
Yes, to be guilty of conspiracy,

07:38.520 --> 07:39.953
Cary's advice had
to have been followed.

07:39.990 --> 07:41.480
And it wasn't. He's innocent.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.078
Look, is this enough
to get him off?

07:43.130 --> 07:44.654
ALICIA:
I don't think so.

07:44.690 --> 07:47.796
But we could get
his plea withdrawn.

07:47.830 --> 07:49.718
Where are you, Kalinda?
I'm coming to you.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.192
No, uh, go to the courthouse.

07:51.230 --> 07:52.891
I will petition for time
with Judge Cuesta.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.032
And I'll meet you there.

07:54.070 --> 07:55.958
Okay.
I'll meet you there, too.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.501
No, Alicia,
Judge Cuesta doesn't like you.

07:57.540 --> 07:59.030
You stay where you are.

07:59.070 --> 08:01.072
No, what are you talking
about? Meet who where?

08:01.110 --> 08:02.236
Look, I can't not be involved.

08:02.280 --> 08:04.601
I know, and I'll call you.
Just sit tight.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.572
Alicia, you have
a debate tomorrow.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.247
If you don't prep for it,
you will lose it.

08:08.280 --> 08:09.781
It's that simple.

08:09.820 --> 08:10.912
Okay, I, uh, I got

08:10.950 --> 08:12.850
three journalists
and one moderator.

08:12.890 --> 08:14.858
And I acted really mad about
the standing, so we got it.

08:14.890 --> 08:16.187
We got standing!
Yeah, they think
Alicia wants to sit.

08:16.220 --> 08:17.983
I just need to call Cary.

08:18.030 --> 08:19.088
No, you don't.

08:19.130 --> 08:20.552
You need to debate.
Oh, Adrian.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.022
How are you?
I'm good, Mr. Gold.

08:22.060 --> 08:23.960
It's unfortunate
we're lnSIde today.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.695
It's so beautiful outside.

08:25.730 --> 08:27.869
Yeah. Alicia, this
is Dr. Adrien Fluke,

08:27.900 --> 08:29.265
_Professor_ of
Renaissance Literature

08:29.300 --> 08:31.109
at the University
of Chicago.

08:31.140 --> 08:33.131
He'll be playing
Frank Prady today.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.738
Yes, in Middle English.

08:34.780 --> 08:38.045
"His heed was balled,
that shoon as any glas,

08:38.080 --> 08:39.570
and eek his face..."

08:39.620 --> 08:41.269
No. But thanks.

08:41.320 --> 08:43.015
Johnny?

08:43.050 --> 08:44.540
We need to have a
word with Alicia.

08:44.590 --> 08:46.182
Would you give us
a second, Adrien?
Sure.

08:46.220 --> 08:48.586
You are down by two points.
That's within the

08:48.620 --> 08:50.724
margin of error.
JOHNNY: Yes, but
you've settled there.

08:50.760 --> 08:52.022
We've let the Prady team think

08:52.060 --> 08:53.857
that you're going into
this sedate and soft.

08:53.900 --> 08:55.720
JOHNNY:
That's why during the debate
negotiations we asked

08:55.760 --> 08:57.068
that you be seated.
It's a less aggressive stance.

08:57.100 --> 08:58.988
And we've also leaked
some campaign memos

08:59.030 --> 09:00.930
arguing that voters don't want
to see a woman be aggressive.

09:00.970 --> 09:02.289
All to catch them
with their pants down.

09:02.340 --> 09:04.228
But this only works
if you use the debate

09:04.270 --> 09:05.965
to take the fight to them.

09:06.010 --> 09:07.932
I just need a second.

09:07.980 --> 09:10.642
(line ringing)

09:10.680 --> 09:12.568
Take her phone.

09:12.620 --> 09:13.848
What?
Take her cell phone.

09:13.880 --> 09:15.575
Hide it.
Dad, I'm the body woman.

09:15.620 --> 09:17.110
I'm not gonna take her...
You work for this campaign.

09:17.150 --> 09:19.311
When she hangs up,
take her cell phone!

09:21.960 --> 09:24.622
KROFI':
Some inmate rolls up on you...

09:24.660 --> 09:25.957
Stand up.

09:25.990 --> 09:27.628
Okay, keep your distance.

09:27.660 --> 09:29.150
Okay? Don't square up.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.589
That's aggression.
You're gonna provoke.

09:31.630 --> 09:32.961
So, bring it down a notch?
Yes!

09:33.000 --> 09:34.991
Deescalate.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.702
And the best way to do that
is to get him to say yes.

09:37.740 --> 09:39.879
You ever spend time
around a toddler?

09:39.910 --> 09:41.935
. M -
Like, "N31 231 m'
I
, no, no!"

09:41.980 --> 09:43.345
It's the same thing
with these cons.

09:43.380 --> 09:45.701
Some gangster wants something
that belongs to you,

09:45.750 --> 09:47.968
get him saying yes,

09:48.020 --> 09:50.011
and watch the resistance
just fall away.

09:50.050 --> 09:51.847
JOHNNY:
Okay, first question.

09:51.890 --> 09:53.778
Let's start with the personal--
Alicia?

09:53.820 --> 09:55.754
Your law partner recently
pleaded guilty to a drug charge.

09:55.790 --> 09:58.088
Mr. Prady, do you have a
question for Alicia about this?

09:58.130 --> 09:59.620
I do.

09:59.660 --> 10:01.628
What you need for
State's Attorney is

10:01.660 --> 10:03.992
someone who upholds the moral
authority of their office.

10:04.030 --> 10:06.123
Someone who does not have
a compromised |aw partner.

10:06.170 --> 10:08.331
And someone who fights

10:08.370 --> 10:10.361
for the law-abiding citizen.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.264
Now, do you really think

10:12.310 --> 10:14.631
that you're that person?

10:14.680 --> 10:16.170
Mrs. Florrick?

10:16.210 --> 10:17.279
Yes?
Do you have a response

10:17.310 --> 10:18.846
for Mr. Prady's question?

10:18.880 --> 10:22.111
Oh, I thought he was still
busy making a statement.

10:22.150 --> 10:24.311
No snark. Come on!
Well, here's the thing.

10:24.350 --> 10:26.659
Um, Cary's innocent.

10:26.690 --> 10:28.317
My law partner,
he didn't do it.

10:28.360 --> 10:30.055
Mm-hmm. Why'd he plead guilty?

10:30.090 --> 10:32.388
Mr. Moderator, can he
just interrupt like that?

10:32.430 --> 10:34.421
That's a Romney move.
Don't referee.

10:34.460 --> 10:36.325
You've got to get
her in the game.

10:36.360 --> 10:39.329
I'm her body woman,
not her fluffer.

10:39.370 --> 10:41.361
When did you become so crass?
JOHNNY:
No, but it is a pertinent

10:41.400 --> 10:43.368
question-- if he's innocent,
why did he plead guilty?

10:43.410 --> 10:45.366
I didn't think I was debating
two people today.

10:45.410 --> 10:48.334
But, um...

10:48.380 --> 10:51.372
well, it's important
to remember that sometimes

10:51.410 --> 10:54.709
innocent people plead guilty.

10:54.750 --> 10:56.741
They...
(cell phone ringing)

10:57.850 --> 10:59.909
Alicia?

10:59.960 --> 11:02.053
We're taking five...

11:02.090 --> 11:04.251
Diane?

11:04.290 --> 11:05.427
How's it going?

11:05.460 --> 11:07.451
We're meeting with Cuesta
in a minute.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.389
Kalinda got an affidavit
from Toronto.
That's great news.

11:10.430 --> 11:13.467
We may need Peter's help
if this doesn't work.

11:13.500 --> 11:14.933
I know, I'm ready to call him.

11:14.970 --> 11:16.392
(phone line beeps)
All right, wait.

11:16.440 --> 11:18.169
Uh, that's somebody
on my other line now.

11:18.210 --> 11:19.404
I'll call you back.

11:19.440 --> 11:20.998
Hello?

11:21.040 --> 11:22.439
ELI:
Hello, Diane, this is Eli.

11:22.480 --> 11:25.074
Eli, I don't have
time right now.

11:25.110 --> 11:26.475
Oh, yes, you do.

11:26.510 --> 11:28.239
I need you to stop
taking Alicia's calls.

11:28.280 --> 11:30.316
We're trying to prepare her
for the debate of her life

11:30.350 --> 11:32.318
and all she's thinking
about is Cary.

11:32.350 --> 11:34.750
Well, then tell her
to stop calling me.
Diane, listen to me.

11:34.790 --> 11:36.724
Alicia can make
a difference for Cary

11:36.760 --> 11:39.149
and any other Cary that comes
along, but only if she wins.

11:39.190 --> 11:40.691
All right, I'll see
what I can do, I got to go.

11:43.300 --> 11:46.167
Isn't this case over, counselor?
I'm afraid not,
Your Honor.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.464
My client would like to file a
motion to withdraw his plea.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.104
Oh, come on.

11:50.140 --> 11:51.505
We have new evidence

11:51.540 --> 11:53.303
that shows the prosecution
charged my client

11:53.340 --> 11:55.205
with a crime
they knew he did not commit.

11:55.240 --> 11:57.470
Your Honor,
this is not gym class.

11:57.510 --> 11:59.501
There are no do-overs.
CUESTA:
What new evidence?

11:59.550 --> 12:01.768
DIANE: An affidavit from
Canadian authorities that show

12:01.820 --> 12:03.788
that the drugs at issue
in this case were part

12:03.820 --> 12:06.015
of a Toronto-based
drug operation.

12:06.050 --> 12:07.779
Okay, am I supposed
to be impressed?

12:07.820 --> 12:10.789
The Toronto detectives noted
that the shipment arrived

12:10.830 --> 12:14.254
in Chicago on May 11,
two full weeks

12:14.300 --> 12:17.497
before my client allegedly
gave his damning advice.

12:19.900 --> 12:23.802
Your Honor, the prosecution
has charged my client

12:23.840 --> 12:26.263
with conspiring to import
$1.3 million worth

12:26.310 --> 12:28.107
of heroin into the country.

12:28.140 --> 12:30.802
That charge is inconsistent
with what in fact occurred.

12:30.850 --> 12:33.239
But your client pled
to those facts.

12:33.280 --> 12:34.770
Yes, because
he was being framed.

12:34.820 --> 12:35.809
Framed by who?

12:35.850 --> 12:37.249
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.042
Counselor, where is the evidence

12:39.090 --> 12:40.819
that the prosecution
knew about this?

12:42.860 --> 12:46.057
CUESTA: Because the only way
I'm rescinding the plea

12:46.090 --> 12:47.523
is if you can show

12:47.560 --> 12:51.018
that the prosecution withheld
exculpatory evidence.

12:51.070 --> 12:52.025
But, Your Honor,
my client pled...

12:52.070 --> 12:53.560
I don't care
what he pled to.

12:53.600 --> 12:57.138
I only care if he pled
because the prosecution lied.

12:57.170 --> 13:00.901
Now, do you have proof
that the prosecution knew

13:00.940 --> 13:04.148
that the drugs
arrived on May 11?

13:04.180 --> 13:06.842
No.

13:08.850 --> 13:10.249
Well, then there's
nothing I can do.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.212
We only ask
for our day in court.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.854
And you can have it.

13:13.890 --> 13:16.950
If you can show proof
of a Brady violation

13:16.990 --> 13:21.120
and bring it to me before the
sentencing hearing at 5:00 pm.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.219
(gavel slams)

13:23.270 --> 13:24.828
That's not much time.

13:24.870 --> 13:26.861
Six hours.
We've had worse.

13:43.620 --> 13:46.180
(overlapping conversations)

13:46.420 --> 13:47.409
We have been
given a task.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.416
Probably the most important
task we will face

13:49.460 --> 13:51.428
this year or any year.

13:51.460 --> 13:55.021
Two days ago, Cary Agos accepted
a plea bargain on drug charges,

13:55.060 --> 13:58.860
and will spend four years
in prison unless...

13:58.900 --> 14:00.492
unless we _can _find
a Brady Violation

14:00.540 --> 14:03.134
in the state's
attorney's work.

14:03.170 --> 14:06.333
We have six...
five hours and 36 minutes

14:06.370 --> 14:08.338
before Cary is taken
into custody.

14:08.380 --> 14:09.574
Kalinda.

14:09.610 --> 14:11.248
Okay, so the
drugs at issue

14:11.280 --> 14:12.975
_ in this case were
imported two weeks

14:13.020 --> 14:16.148
before Cary allegedly
committed conspiracy.

14:16.180 --> 14:17.989
And the Canadian authorities
knew this.

14:18.020 --> 14:20.056
That's the exculpatory evidence
you think they buried?

14:20.090 --> 14:22.183
Yes, but any buried
evidence will do.

14:22.220 --> 14:24.222
All right, so we'll break up
into groups.

14:24.260 --> 14:26.080
Carey Zepps, your team
will focus on discovery.
Evidence boxes are here.

14:26.130 --> 14:28.496
Check to see if the SA's
office had any involvement

14:28.530 --> 14:31.363
with border agents,
Homeland Security, anything.

14:31.400 --> 14:34.198
(cell phone rings)
And, Brian, you do the
same with the Chicago PD.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.639
CAREY: Uh, Someone should also
contact Mexican authorities.

14:35.670 --> 14:38.059
See if they knew anything
about the shipment.

14:38.110 --> 14:39.463
KaHnda?

14:39.510 --> 14:40.636
KALINDA: Uh, no, I'm gonna stay
with the Canadian side.

14:40.680 --> 14:43.046
I have friends
up there.

14:43.080 --> 14:45.048
Uh, okay.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.469
Let's regroup in two hours
for a progress report.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.670
Remember, Cary is
counting on us.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.119
Kalinda.

14:51.150 --> 14:53.550
(overlapping conversations)

14:54.660 --> 14:56.059
Cary called me.

14:56.090 --> 14:57.523
Should we tell him?

14:57.560 --> 14:59.255
He'll want to know
what we have.

14:59.290 --> 15:00.450
I know.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.092
But we have nothing.

15:02.130 --> 15:03.563
And Cary's preparing
to go to prison tomorrow.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.261
(cell phone rings)
We should
let him prepare.

15:05.300 --> 15:06.699
I think you're
right, okay.

15:06.730 --> 15:08.095
(sighs)

15:08.140 --> 15:10.108
This time it's Alicia.
Wait.

15:10.140 --> 15:12.108
Hi, Alicia.

15:12.140 --> 15:15.109
Cuesta needs a Brady violation,
or he won't vacate the plea.

15:15.140 --> 15:17.108
We have until 5:00.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.549
Uh, no, Alicia,
listen to me.

15:18.580 --> 15:19.945
Uh, no.

15:19.980 --> 15:21.311
Diane, I can leave right now.

15:21.350 --> 15:23.614
No, we have everybody on this,
we don't need you.

15:23.650 --> 15:25.288
And, Alicia, I need you
to stop calling me.

15:25.320 --> 15:27.117
What?

15:27.160 --> 15:30.254
Uh, yeah, I don't mean to be
rude, but we need to focus here.

15:30.290 --> 15:33.350
Um, I'll call you at 5:00
after the sentencing. Good-bye.

15:35.160 --> 15:37.128
ELI:
Good, can we continue?

15:37.170 --> 15:40.139
I'll hold that for you.

15:40.170 --> 15:41.967
Do you want
some milk?

15:42.000 --> 15:43.558
No. What?

15:43.610 --> 15:44.963
I-I don't like milk.

15:45.010 --> 15:46.159
Why not?

15:46.210 --> 15:47.177
It's good for you.

15:47.210 --> 15:49.178
Let's go, let's do it.

15:49.210 --> 15:50.575
So, what's this about, ma'am?

15:50.610 --> 15:51.747
KALINDA: You're with
the Ontario Division,

15:51.780 --> 15:52.747
is that right,
Inspector?

15:52.780 --> 15:55.146
It is-- "0" Division, narcotics.

15:55.180 --> 15:57.148
And you were tracking
the shipment of heroin

15:57.190 --> 15:59.146
coming in from Chicago?

15:59.190 --> 16:01.215
Yes, ma'am, we were following
a gang out of Rexdale.

16:01.260 --> 16:03.683
And you believed their heroin
was being transported

16:03.730 --> 16:05.357
through Chicago?

16:05.390 --> 16:07.324
Yes, but when I reached out
to Detective Prima...

16:07.360 --> 16:09.351
Uh, wait a minute.

16:09.400 --> 16:13.439
Excuse me, Inspector,
but did you say you contacted...

16:13.470 --> 16:15.199
Detective Prima?

16:15.240 --> 16:17.231
Yes, I... I e-mailed him

16:17.270 --> 16:18.703
an official request
for information. Why?

16:18.740 --> 16:21.208
Do you still have

16:21.240 --> 16:23.276
that e-mail, Inspector?

16:23.310 --> 16:24.402
Yes. Certainly.

16:24.450 --> 16:26.202
Can you send it to me?

16:26.250 --> 16:28.241
Yes, ifI knew
what this was about.

16:28.280 --> 16:31.784
The Chicago police believe
that $1.3 million in heroin

16:31.820 --> 16:33.583
was being imported
into the States,

16:33.620 --> 16:36.418
but you wrote to them
that it was being exported

16:36.460 --> 16:38.121
into Ontario, correct?
Yes.

16:38.160 --> 16:40.390
And what did Detective Prima
say?
Excuse me.

16:40.430 --> 16:43.228
Well, I don't mind saying I-I,
uh, was a little disappointed

16:43.270 --> 16:46.159
he didn't have the courtesy
to, uh, respond.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.261
Diane... we_need
to subpoena Prima now.

16:50.310 --> 16:51.800
You found the
Brady violation?

16:51.840 --> 16:53.330
Yeah.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.234
KROFI':
Anyone you trust out here?

16:55.280 --> 16:57.601
Uh... yeah.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.504
Who? Family?

16:59.550 --> 17:01.347
No.
(chuckles)

17:01.380 --> 17:02.711
Sounds like my life.

17:02.750 --> 17:04.638
Girlfriend?
Friend? Wife?

17:04.690 --> 17:06.681
(groans): A friend
and a girlfriend.

17:06.720 --> 17:08.813
Who's the friend?
Alicia.

17:08.860 --> 17:10.828
The girl that
was here, right?
Right.

17:10.860 --> 17:12.384
Give her your
power of attorney.

17:12.430 --> 17:15.354
Everything you need done,
everything you need sent.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.220
Do not trust
the girlfriend.

17:17.270 --> 17:20.239
Things change
when you go inside.

17:20.270 --> 17:22.067
Go ahead, call her.

17:22.100 --> 17:23.499
Call Alicia.

17:23.540 --> 17:25.633
ALICIA: One of the reasons
I'm running,

17:25.670 --> 17:27.376
if not the prime reason,

17:27.410 --> 17:30.402
is that I saw how
a marauding state's attorney

17:30.450 --> 17:32.338
ruins people's lives.

17:32.380 --> 17:34.371
(laughing)

17:35.280 --> 17:37.248
Not just the life of my partner,

17:37.290 --> 17:40.179
but the lives of widows
and orphans, whose loved ones

17:40.220 --> 17:43.383
_ have been murdered
in the recent gun Violence.
Yay!

17:43.430 --> 17:47.127
Do you have a response
to that, Mr. Prady?

17:47.160 --> 17:50.368
My... response to...
Uh, to what
Alicia just said

17:50.400 --> 17:52.265
about the State's
Attorney's office.

17:52.300 --> 17:54.393
ADRIAN: Um...
(clears throat)

17:54.440 --> 17:56.567
(laughing)

17:56.600 --> 17:58.261
(laughing
dies down)

17:58.310 --> 17:59.732
(Adrian resumes laughing)

17:59.770 --> 18:02.603
What the hell?

18:03.650 --> 18:05.345
I'm sorry.

18:05.380 --> 18:06.847
I'm sorry, that was
totally inappropriate

18:06.880 --> 18:08.279
on-on my part.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.617
(clears throat, sniffs)

18:09.650 --> 18:13.654
She just looked so serious
staring at me.

18:13.690 --> 18:17.456
ADRIAN:
Uh... what do I think of the,

18:17.490 --> 18:19.822
uh, State's Attorney's office?

18:19.860 --> 18:21.691
I... (resumes laughing)

18:21.730 --> 18:23.425
Ijust...

18:23.470 --> 18:25.620
Okay, well, this
was a... great idea.

18:25.670 --> 18:27.490
Mr. Fluke, what
are you doing?
Dr. Fluke.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.337
Thank you very much, okay?
And nothing.

18:29.370 --> 18:30.302
ADRIAN: I'm not
doing anything. I'm fine.

18:30.340 --> 18:31.307
He's high.

18:31.340 --> 18:33.433
High? No, I'm not high.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.778
I... I'm pleasant.

18:35.810 --> 18:37.471
Okay, we need
a new sparring partner.

18:37.510 --> 18:39.239
ADRIAN: Come on, guys,
this is medical marijuana

18:39.280 --> 18:41.168
for my glaucoma, okay?

18:41.220 --> 18:42.812
I'm functioning here,
I really am.

18:42.850 --> 18:45.648
(Adrian resumes laughing)

18:45.690 --> 18:47.453
You need to get laid.

18:47.490 --> 18:49.788
You got to start
creating memories now.

18:49.820 --> 18:52.380
What's your
girlfriend's name?

18:52.430 --> 18:53.795
Kalinda.

18:53.830 --> 18:55.457
Give me your phone.

18:55.500 --> 18:58.424
You're going two to four years
without a moment

18:58.470 --> 19:00.392
of affection or comfort--
so give me the phone.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.590
(phone ringing)
Maybe that's her.

19:02.640 --> 19:04.631
(exhales)

19:05.640 --> 19:07.335
Hi, Alicia.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.648
No. Why?

19:10.680 --> 19:12.238
What?

19:12.280 --> 19:13.542
Where_are we
on overturning the plea?

19:13.580 --> 19:15.275
I can't ahold of Diane.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.571
What do you mean?

19:16.620 --> 19:18.485
Your plea.
The Brady violation.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.448
Uh... wha...

19:24.330 --> 19:25.957
It, um... okay, uh, I...

19:25.990 --> 19:28.390
let me call you back.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.560
Your Honor, we would like
to subpoena the backup drives

19:36.600 --> 19:39.205
of the CPD's
Fourth District.
This is completely

19:39.240 --> 19:40.673
unnecessary, Your Honor--
Detective Prima stated

19:40.710 --> 19:42.905
on the_record _
he never received an e-mail

19:42.940 --> 19:45.443
from Toronto.
Then he shouldn't mind us
taking a look at the backup.

19:45.480 --> 19:48.210
You know you only have
four hours left, Counselor?

19:48.250 --> 19:50.514
I do, Your Honor.
It's very dramatic.
Objection!

19:50.550 --> 19:51.847
The defense
is trying

19:51.890 --> 19:53.448
to manipulate your affection
for the dramatic,

19:53.490 --> 19:54.752
Your Honor.
I know she is,

19:54.790 --> 19:55.859
Madam ASA.

19:55.890 --> 19:58.620
And yet, I do love the dramatic.

19:58.660 --> 20:00.423
Subpoena approved.
And if I were you,

20:00.460 --> 20:02.826
Ms. Lockhart, I would race
out of this court right now.

20:02.860 --> 20:03.929
Thank you, Your Honor.

20:03.970 --> 20:06.427
(Diane running)

20:07.500 --> 20:08.694
HOWELL:
Oh, we're in.

20:08.740 --> 20:10.799
That's CPD's server.

20:10.840 --> 20:12.637
Okay, good.
Now, can you access

20:12.670 --> 20:14.706
the individual
e-mail archives?
Mm...

20:14.740 --> 20:16.605
I can access anything, Kalinda.

20:16.640 --> 20:18.471
Good, 'cause I need
positive proof

20:18.510 --> 20:20.546
that he received
this e-mail.

20:21.850 --> 20:24.489
Nope, he did not.

20:24.520 --> 20:25.646
What?

20:25.690 --> 20:27.248
He didn't receive
that e-mail.

20:27.290 --> 20:30.418
You know that already?
I do. There.

20:30.460 --> 20:33.554
KALIN DA:
Wait. Couldn't it have

20:33.600 --> 20:36.649
been deleted?
Ah... that's
the question, isn't it?

20:36.700 --> 20:38.520
Howell.
Yeah, time for the metadata.

20:38.570 --> 20:41.368
You delete an e-mail, it's still
gonna show up in the metadata.

20:41.400 --> 20:42.890
Metadata don't lie.

20:42.940 --> 20:44.737
(phone ringing)

20:46.570 --> 20:48.731
(ringing continues)

20:50.610 --> 20:51.702
Hello?

20:51.750 --> 20:53.968
KROFI':
Are you the girlfriend?

20:54.020 --> 20:55.817
Uh, who is this?

20:55.850 --> 20:59.388
It's the damn tooth fairy.
Are you his girlfriend?

20:59.420 --> 21:01.615
Is this the Bishop call?

21:01.660 --> 21:02.479
It's the prison consultant.

21:02.520 --> 21:03.851
Your boy's throwing up
in the bathroom.

21:03.890 --> 21:05.551
If I were you,
I'd get your ass

21:05.590 --> 21:08.024
down here and do your job.
My job? What's my job?

21:08.060 --> 21:09.789
It's your boyfriend's
last four hours of freedom.

21:09.830 --> 21:11.525
You_ need to screw
his brains out.

21:11.570 --> 21:13.390
Look, I'm a little bit busy
right now, okay?

21:13.440 --> 21:15.362
He's going away for four years.
Four years.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.960
What else do you have to do
that's more important than that?

21:18.010 --> 21:19.034
Okay,
almost there.

21:19.070 --> 21:20.037
I'm getting him a hooker.

21:20.070 --> 21:21.879
You don't get down here,

21:21.910 --> 21:24.378
I'm getting on the phone
with ﬁve hookers I know.

21:24.410 --> 21:27.004
'Cause he's a nice kid,
and he deserves a memory.

21:27.050 --> 21:28.972
Yeah, look, I'll get back
to you, all right?

21:29.020 --> 21:30.612
Okay, here we go.
Metadata.

21:30.650 --> 21:32.641
And wear something sew.

21:34.020 --> 21:35.487
What?
Uh, bad news.

21:35.520 --> 21:37.988
I went to his spam folder,
and he has it set up

21:38.030 --> 21:41.397
to automatically delete
at the end of every week.

21:41.430 --> 21:42.897
Well, couldn't he
have read it first?

21:42.930 --> 21:45.967
Nah. The metadata says
he never opened it.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.639
Sorry, K.
It's a dead end.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.568
(sighs)

21:52.610 --> 21:54.999
*

21:58.080 --> 22:00.071
(knocking on door)

22:04.390 --> 22:05.914
Hi.

22:05.950 --> 22:08.510
Good. You came to your senses.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.858
Okay, I approve.

22:10.890 --> 22:12.858
All right, I'm gonna leave
you two alone for a minute.

22:12.890 --> 22:15.097
Not too long.
We got work to do.

22:22.700 --> 22:25.066
Treat me like an adult
and tell me everything!
It was a Hail Mary pass,

22:25.110 --> 22:28.830
and you needed to focus
on getting ready for prison.
I don't care

22:28.880 --> 22:30.939
how far-fetched it is,
Kalinda. If there's even
the slightest chance

22:30.980 --> 22:33.073
of me beating...
What do you mean?
There isn't.

22:33.110 --> 22:37.069
Alicia said that there was...
We were trying to
find a Brady violation.

22:37.120 --> 22:40.556
And there isn't one.

22:40.590 --> 22:44.026
I'm sorry, Cary.

22:45.860 --> 22:48.021
Okay.

22:49.030 --> 22:52.591
(sighs)

22:59.770 --> 23:01.738
Hey, I got to live
in hope for an hour.

23:01.780 --> 23:03.998
That's something,
I guess.

23:11.120 --> 23:12.940
(knocking on door)

23:12.990 --> 23:15.151
KROFI':
Less talking, more sex.

23:15.190 --> 23:17.784
(both chuckle)

23:21.100 --> 23:23.056
So, Eli, is there anything
in particular

23:23.100 --> 23:25.068
you want me
to focus on?
Just one thing.

23:25.100 --> 23:27.694
Bury her.

23:27.740 --> 23:28.934
Bury her?

23:28.970 --> 23:30.767
Don't let up.
Go for the jugular.

23:30.810 --> 23:32.766
Just like you would if
it were a real debate.

23:32.810 --> 23:34.698
Okay.

23:34.740 --> 23:38.471
Chara_cter. Character is the
central issue in this campaign.

23:38.510 --> 23:40.478
The SA. must be above

23:40.520 --> 23:42.010
ethical reproach, and that
is where my opponent falters.

23:42.050 --> 23:45.986
Excuse me, but I...
The company that
we keep matters.

23:46.020 --> 23:48.580
Mrs. Florrick has
represented the biggest
drug dealer in Chicago.

23:48.620 --> 23:51.851
She has represented the
wife-killer, Colin Sweeney.

23:51.890 --> 23:54.222
Governor Florrick,
we're all acquainted

23:54.260 --> 23:56.751
with Governor Florrick's record.
As a candidate
for this office,

23:56.800 --> 23:58.859
Mr. Prady should understand
the importance

23:58.900 --> 24:00.868
of judging people
on their own merits,

24:00.900 --> 24:03.767
instead of engaging
in guilt by association.
Mm.

24:03.810 --> 24:04.902
The cynicism

24:04.940 --> 24:07.829
is beneath him.
Better.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.836
So that was a memory.

24:09.880 --> 24:12.098
(chuckles)

24:13.850 --> 24:16.739
Hey. Again?

24:16.780 --> 24:18.987
Sure.

24:27.130 --> 24:29.690
I won't disappear
on you.

24:29.730 --> 24:32.096
Four years is a long time.

24:32.130 --> 24:35.099
Two years with
good behavior.

24:35.140 --> 24:37.734
Yeah.

24:40.840 --> 24:43.673
I'll be here.

24:45.310 --> 24:47.870
Good.

24:49.150 --> 24:50.549
KROFT:
So...

24:50.590 --> 24:52.808
rotated the tires?

24:54.160 --> 24:56.754
(door opens)

24:57.760 --> 25:00.058
(door closes)

25:19.080 --> 25:21.810
How hard would it be

25:21.850 --> 25:24.580
to fake the metadata
of Prima's account?

25:24.620 --> 25:26.918
What do you mean, Kalinda?

25:30.260 --> 25:32.285
How hard would it be
to make it look

25:32.330 --> 25:33.888
like he read the e-mail
from Canada?

25:33.930 --> 25:35.898
You know that's
illegal, right?

25:35.930 --> 25:38.023
Yes, but I'm asking
hypothetically.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.959
It wouldn't be that hard.
But, Kalinda, you hack someone,

25:41.000 --> 25:42.888
you pray there are no cops
waiting on the other end.

25:42.940 --> 25:44.100
This is all cops?

25:44.140 --> 25:45.562
(knocking)

25:45.610 --> 25:48.135
Kalinda. Anything?
Not yet.

25:48.180 --> 25:50.307
But I'm working on something.
Let me know as
soon as you can.

25:50.340 --> 25:51.978
We've only
got two hours.

25:55.020 --> 25:58.649
Okay, look, uh,
here's the thing.

25:58.690 --> 26:02.717
You show me, in theory,
how one would do it.

26:02.760 --> 26:04.159
Then you leave.

26:04.190 --> 26:06.579
You don't contact me,
I don't contact you.

26:06.630 --> 26:09.019
And if this gets more serious...

26:09.060 --> 26:13.167
you tell the truth: I asked you
how to hack into an account.

26:13.200 --> 26:15.862
But you had nothing
to do with it.
Kalinda.

26:15.900 --> 26:18.039
I love you.

26:18.070 --> 26:21.233
I'll do what you ask.

26:21.280 --> 26:25.046
But you can get in some
real trouble with this.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.115
I know.

26:31.990 --> 26:34.208
Show me.

26:35.920 --> 26:37.080
Like this.

26:37.120 --> 26:39.350
Always like this.

26:39.390 --> 26:40.789
It's not because someone's
gonna steal your food.

26:40.830 --> 26:42.058
It's because someone might slip

26:42.100 --> 26:43.226
a piece of glass into it.

26:43.260 --> 26:44.864
Now eat.

26:44.900 --> 26:46.390
I'm not hungry.

26:46.430 --> 26:48.637
Three squares a day.
Food's lousy,

26:48.670 --> 26:50.900
but you got to keep
your strength up.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.875
Look, you got a misconception
about all this.

26:55.910 --> 26:58.174
From 02 and Shawshank.

26:58.210 --> 27:00.713
Where you're going,
it's not like that.

27:00.750 --> 27:02.342
You're gonna be fine.
Your first few months

27:02.380 --> 27:04.814
and your last few months
are the hardest.

27:04.850 --> 27:08.308
Anyone ever ask you
about taking off?

27:10.830 --> 27:12.286
Yeah.

27:12.330 --> 27:13.797
What do you
tell 'em?

27:13.830 --> 27:15.297
Problematic.

27:15.330 --> 27:17.719
Why?

27:17.770 --> 27:19.829
Where do you go?

27:19.870 --> 27:21.030
Two years goes faster
than you think.

27:21.070 --> 27:22.367
It's four years.

27:24.340 --> 27:27.036
You ever been to Spain?

27:27.070 --> 27:29.732
They have extradition.

27:29.780 --> 27:34.672
Look, you do what you want,

27:34.720 --> 27:37.280
but you're not built
to be an outlaw.

27:37.320 --> 27:41.450
My whole life,
I wanted to be one thing.

27:41.490 --> 27:44.459
A lawyer.

27:44.490 --> 27:46.879
And I had it.

27:46.930 --> 27:48.898
I had it. I had it figured out.

27:48.930 --> 27:51.228
Get to the top,
take the cases I wanted,

27:51.270 --> 27:53.124
help the people I wanted.

27:53.170 --> 27:55.764
Now...

27:58.170 --> 28:00.365
...I can't...

28:00.410 --> 28:02.378
I can't...

28:02.410 --> 28:06.244
can't figure anything out.

28:06.280 --> 28:08.248
(shuddering exhale)
Look at me.

28:11.020 --> 28:13.750
Don't do it.

28:16.460 --> 28:17.722
...so_ it can't be used
to investigate you,

28:17.760 --> 28:19.159
your husband, or your partners.

28:19.190 --> 28:21.397
Now, that, that is the
height of cynicism.

28:21.430 --> 28:23.227
Let's talk cynicism.
Mm.

28:23.260 --> 28:25.262
The cynicism
of a lifelong Republican

28:25.300 --> 28:27.894
switching parties in
advance of his candidacy.
(indistinct chatter)

28:27.940 --> 28:30.932
JOHNNY:
Mr. Governor.
PETER: Hi. Sorry. Hi.

28:30.970 --> 28:32.130
I had an hour. I
thought I'd take a peek.

28:32.170 --> 28:33.774
You can't stay away.

28:33.810 --> 28:35.402
I'll just sit over here,
out of the way.

28:35.440 --> 28:38.739
HOWELL:
This is what I would do.

28:38.780 --> 28:39.940
Scroll back up.

28:39.980 --> 28:42.244
That shows the e-mail
went directly

28:42.280 --> 28:44.180
to the detective's spam folder.

28:44.220 --> 28:46.415
Now, that shows
that it was deleted unread.

28:46.450 --> 28:48.281
If one were to do this,

28:48.320 --> 28:50.151
that's what
one would change.

28:50.190 --> 28:52.078
Now correct the date,

28:52.130 --> 28:54.257
move it out of spam,

28:54.300 --> 28:55.995
and change it to "read."

28:56.030 --> 28:59.090
Easy.
Now you have to do it here.

28:59.130 --> 29:01.030
Make it match.

29:01.070 --> 29:02.389
Congrats.

29:02.440 --> 29:04.408
He officially read the e-mail
the day he got it.

29:04.440 --> 29:07.000
(knocking, door opens)
CAREY:
Hey.

29:07.040 --> 29:08.234
Um, do you have a minute?

29:08.280 --> 29:09.474
Yeah. One sec.

29:09.510 --> 29:12.070
Yeah, I'll talk to you, K.
Thanks.

29:15.880 --> 29:18.383
Um, I think I found something.

29:18.420 --> 29:20.012
I was thinking back
over our interview with Prima.

29:20.050 --> 29:21.483
He kept saying "we."

29:21.520 --> 29:24.387
"We never heard the name
Inspector Fra2ier." Who's "we"?

29:24.430 --> 29:26.955
Well, he means the force,
the police.
I don't think so.

29:26.990 --> 29:28.321
Check this out.
This is a transcript

29:28.360 --> 29:30.191
of Prima's interrogation

29:30.230 --> 29:32.266
of Trey Wagner, when they got
him to wear the wire.

29:32.300 --> 29:35.098
Now, it's just Prima and Trey,
but it's weird.

29:35.140 --> 29:36.937
Read that.

29:36.970 --> 29:38.938
"I'm going to see what I can do
to help you, Trey,

29:38.970 --> 29:41.404
but you gotta help me, too."
Trey: "I don't know anything."

29:41.440 --> 29:43.977
Prima: "Shut up...
you lying piece of crap."

29:44.010 --> 29:45.307
You see?
It's like good cop/bad cop,

29:45.350 --> 29:46.874
only he's doing both cops.

29:46.910 --> 29:48.810
Someone else was there.

29:51.950 --> 29:53.417
KALINDA:
That's Prima's former partner.

29:53.450 --> 29:55.259
All the paperwork
right up to Trey's arrest

29:55.290 --> 29:58.054
has both their signatures,
Rodriguez and Prima,

29:58.090 --> 30:00.285
until the day
of the interrogation.

30:00.330 --> 30:01.922
After that,
it's just Prima.

30:01.960 --> 30:03.928
Now, maybe he retired
or got relocated or...

30:03.970 --> 30:05.289
Or maybe he wanted off the case.

30:06.470 --> 30:09.234
Very smart.
Hey,

30:09.270 --> 30:11.067
when I apply myself.
Now, my guess is

30:11.110 --> 30:13.260
if they're hiding him, Rodriguez
might have something to say.

30:13.310 --> 30:15.938
We only have an hour.

30:18.650 --> 30:22.245
Diane, look,
I think we may have something.

30:22.280 --> 30:25.249
I'll meet you at court,
but, if you can, delay Cuesta.

30:25.290 --> 30:26.882
I may need more time.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.891
(sighs)

30:54.420 --> 30:57.139
The problem starts with guns.
The S.A.'s office
should aggressively

30:57.180 --> 31:01.059
pursue weapons violations...
Except that the office doesn't
have the resources to do so.

31:01.090 --> 31:04.355
PETER:
No, that's not true.
Sorry?

31:04.390 --> 31:05.584
The SA. has the resources.

31:05.630 --> 31:07.257
They just choose
to allocate them elsewhere.

31:07.290 --> 31:08.450
Thanks for the clarification.

31:08.500 --> 31:09.899
My point

31:09.930 --> 31:11.898
is that this office's apathy

31:11.930 --> 31:14.592
of charging gun crimes
sends the wrong message.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.289
I agree.
Further scrutiny

31:16.340 --> 31:19.605
of, uh, this office's
charging policies is warranted.

31:19.640 --> 31:22.336
Wait a minute. Is that it?

31:24.510 --> 31:27.445
Sorry?
"Further scrutiny."
Now, she just made a good point:

31:27.480 --> 31:29.311
guns are a problem,

31:29.350 --> 31:31.181
_ but violent crime
is a bigger problem,

31:31.220 --> 31:33.085
so choices have
to be made.
You know what,

31:33.120 --> 31:34.553
why don't we take
a few minutes here.

31:34.590 --> 31:36.649
Thanks, guys. Um...
Okay.

31:36.690 --> 31:38.351
(whistles)

31:38.390 --> 31:40.381
ELI:
Finn,

31:40.430 --> 31:43.092
you-you can't leave.
Eli, I am obviously
intruding in there.

31:43.130 --> 31:45.519
No, you're not intruding.
Let me talk to him.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.390
It's just
that there are... Oh.

31:47.430 --> 31:50.536
Alicia, something, uh...
a client thing came up.

31:50.570 --> 31:52.538
I have to get
back to work.
Oh, I understand.

31:52.570 --> 31:54.299
Thanks for pitching in.
You're gonna
do great.

31:54.340 --> 31:56.001
You were kicking
my butt in there.
(chuckles)

31:56.040 --> 31:58.008
I think you kicked mine, too.
(chuckles)

31:58.050 --> 32:00.678
So we need to find
a new Prady.

32:08.160 --> 32:11.584
Hey. We should let Eli mix up
the order of the questions.

32:11.630 --> 32:13.029
That way it makes you pivot

32:13.060 --> 32:15.199
on the fly.
Sounds good.

32:15.230 --> 32:18.620
Peter, you know I respect

32:18.670 --> 32:21.434
the line, the line
between husband and governor.

32:21.470 --> 32:24.109
But I need to cross it
and ask you a favor.

32:24.140 --> 32:25.562
Okay.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.601
Cary.

32:27.640 --> 32:30.200
I'm not asking you to consider
a pardon-- I'd never go there.

32:30.240 --> 32:32.379
Ijust want him safe.

32:32.410 --> 32:33.968
You want me to speak
to the D.O.C.

32:34.020 --> 32:36.477
and get him put into
a minimum security facility.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.215
I don't want him
to look over his shoulder

32:38.250 --> 32:39.342
for the next two years.

32:39.390 --> 32:42.279
This_ won't have
any political blowback.

32:42.320 --> 32:44.686
This isn't
Bill Clinton helping Marc Rich.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.982
I can't do that,

32:47.030 --> 32:49.055
and you know why.

32:52.530 --> 32:54.760
You're right. Sorry I asked.

32:54.800 --> 32:56.768
You don't think I
want to help Cary?

32:56.800 --> 32:58.506
He worked for me,
for God's sakes.

32:58.540 --> 33:01.236
Let's just start
this thing.

33:03.480 --> 33:05.368
It's Diane.

33:05.410 --> 33:06.502
Have you heard
anything from Kalinda?

33:06.550 --> 33:08.768
MAN:
No, not yet.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.469
Cuesta's running behind,
thank God.

33:10.520 --> 33:14.115
Call me the second
you hear from her.

33:14.160 --> 33:16.378
CUESTA:
The Illinois

33:16.420 --> 33:19.321
Supreme Court? Me?
Yes, sir.

33:19.360 --> 33:20.520
Things are moving fast--
I have been asked

33:20.560 --> 33:22.619
by the justices
to gauge your interest.

33:22.660 --> 33:24.628
Well, yes, of course,

33:24.670 --> 33:27.389
I'm honored, I'm flattered.

33:27.430 --> 33:29.239
Let me walk you through
how this will play out.

33:29.270 --> 33:30.464
KALIN DA:
James Castro

33:30.500 --> 33:32.730
is corrupt and
he's going down.

33:32.770 --> 33:34.431
Especially if Alicia
Florrick becomes the new

33:34.480 --> 33:36.505
state's attorney, so if
you conspired with him,

33:36.540 --> 33:38.405
if you obstructed
justice...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

33:38.450 --> 33:40.099
I did nothing wrong.

33:40.150 --> 33:41.549
I wouldn't
play ball with Castro,

33:41.580 --> 33:44.515
so they took me off the case.
And what about your partner?

33:44.550 --> 33:46.188
He seemed to have no
problem running With it.

33:46.220 --> 33:48.450
He's the senior detective, what
the hell am I supposed to do?

33:48.490 --> 33:50.583
All I care is
what you do now.

33:50.620 --> 33:52.281
Listen to me.

33:52.330 --> 33:53.581
Castro is a lame duck.

33:53.630 --> 33:55.450
He can't hurt you anymore.

33:55.500 --> 33:58.367
Don't you want to look good
in front of the new S.A.?

33:58.400 --> 34:01.528
What happened in
that interrogation?

34:01.570 --> 34:04.107
Why'd they take your name
off the transcript?

34:04.140 --> 34:06.802
CUESTA:
Well, I'll certainly be ready.

34:06.840 --> 34:08.376
I'm just... Wow, I-I

34:08.410 --> 34:10.503
I thought Flaherty
or Dominguez

34:10.540 --> 34:12.405
were a shoo-in
for the next spot.
Well, sir,

34:12.450 --> 34:14.839
you have fans.

34:14.880 --> 34:16.575
Chief Justice Ryvlan
called you

34:16.620 --> 34:19.509
an inspired choice.
(phone vibrates)

34:25.560 --> 34:27.653
He thinks you'd
bring fresh gusto

34:27.690 --> 34:30.158
to the justices' deliberations.

34:31.730 --> 34:35.439
And when are you meeting
with Flaherty and Dominguez?

34:35.470 --> 34:37.358
Well, there's no plan to.

34:37.400 --> 34:40.130
Not yet.
You are our man.

34:40.170 --> 34:42.536
Really?
You sound surprised.

34:42.580 --> 34:44.741
Well, you've been Peter
Florrick's man for years,

34:44.780 --> 34:47.601
and Peter Florrick wouldn't
cross the street to stop me

34:47.650 --> 34:49.618
from choking, so yeah,
I guess I am surprised.

34:49.650 --> 34:51.117
Things change.

34:51.150 --> 34:52.549
No, they don't.

34:52.590 --> 34:54.285
And you keep checking
your watch, sir.

34:54.320 --> 34:56.379
And the governor just
called to see if I'm still

34:56.420 --> 34:58.752
stuck in this meeting instead
of presiding in court

34:58.790 --> 35:01.554
on a case involving
his wife's firm.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.852
Okay, this
was good.

35:03.900 --> 35:05.822
You tell the governor
next time he calls:

35:05.870 --> 35:07.497
go to hell.

35:07.530 --> 35:10.465
He was the most corrupt S.A.
this county has ever seen.

35:10.500 --> 35:13.162
And now he's the most
corrupt governor.

35:13.210 --> 35:14.472
And that's saying something.
Why don't

35:14.510 --> 35:16.375
you just sit down...
No, no. I'd much

35:16.410 --> 35:18.708
rather destroy his
wife's firm in court.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.399
Even though I've been
successfully stalled

35:20.450 --> 35:21.747
for two hours.

35:23.220 --> 35:24.642
PETER:
Why are you doing this?

35:24.690 --> 35:27.341
Can you be more specific?
It's the most fundamental

35:27.390 --> 35:30.416
question any candidate has
to answer, Mrs. Florrick.

35:30.460 --> 35:33.224
Why are you running for
office? Why do you want
to be state's attorney?

35:33.260 --> 35:35.319
I'm running because I believe
there is a failure in leadership

35:35.360 --> 35:37.499
in the state's
attorney's office.
No,

35:37.530 --> 35:40.829
you're setting up a straw man,
Mr. Castro is not in this race.
I'm not

35:40.870 --> 35:42.497
just blaming Castro.

35:42.540 --> 35:45.566
Cook County
has a history

35:45.610 --> 35:47.669
of prosecutors with serious
ethical shortcomings.

35:47.710 --> 35:50.406
There it is.
PETER: Well, I think
there is a difference

35:50.440 --> 35:53.204
between unethical
and controverSIal.

35:53.250 --> 35:54.672
I know it well.
My husband,

35:54.720 --> 35:57.348
unfortunately,
was both.
Your husband...

35:57.380 --> 36:00.315
is not in this race, either.
But he is.

36:00.350 --> 36:02.454
What he did as S.A.,

36:02.490 --> 36:03.889
what he's doing now
as governor,

36:03.920 --> 36:06.582
informs voters'
perception of me.
For better

36:06.630 --> 36:08.495
or worse.
Absolutely,

36:08.530 --> 36:09.929
but I think it is critical
that people

36:09.960 --> 36:11.689
understand I am not my husband,

36:11.730 --> 36:14.460
and that they can
expect more of me in office.

36:14.500 --> 36:16.593
More accountability.
More responsibility.

36:16.640 --> 36:18.460
Uh-oh.
ALICIA: I'm not looking
beyond the S.A.'s office.

36:18.510 --> 36:19.966
You're never happy.
She's kicking his ass.

36:20.010 --> 36:21.830
ALICIA:
I don't wan_t_a career
in politics.

36:21.880 --> 36:23.609
I'm simply a lavwer,

36:23.640 --> 36:26.200
by training and by temperament.

36:26.250 --> 36:29.640
And what that means
is I have the character

36:29.680 --> 36:31.545
to put the demands of this job

36:31.590 --> 36:33.683
before my own self-interests

36:33.720 --> 36:36.609
and the discipline
to ensure that winning cases

36:36.660 --> 36:40.653
does not become more important
than seeing justice done.

36:40.690 --> 36:42.658
Based on your past,
Mr. Prady,

36:42.700 --> 36:44.668
I don't think
you can say the same.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.195
What the hell?

36:52.270 --> 36:55.706
You just graduated.
That was amazing.

36:55.740 --> 36:58.743
Eli. It's finally going good
for her, and you go and do that?

36:58.780 --> 37:00.907
They needed a break.
They did not need a break.
Your boy needed a break.

37:00.950 --> 37:03.475
You have a problem with me?
Yes, you were worried
about your candidate's ego.

37:03.520 --> 37:05.715
Do you guys want me to leave?
_I'm worried about a
marriage. You should be, too.

37:05.750 --> 37:08.389
That's complete and utter
crap, and you know it.
Think of the long term, Elfman.

37:08.420 --> 37:10.752
Are you doing this for some
stupid little S.A.'s race...
No, I'm doing it because

37:10.790 --> 37:13.020
I want to win.
I am, too. They win if
they're married.

37:13.060 --> 37:15.620
Look at them.
Oh, come on, Eli, don't try
to save your boy at my girl's

37:15.660 --> 37:17.924
expense, okay?
I'm not doing that. They're

37:17.960 --> 37:20.622
tied together at the waist.
That's exactly what you're
doing. She was taking flight

37:20.670 --> 37:23.036
I'm not trying to save one over
the other, that is stupid.
in there, she was starting

37:23.070 --> 37:25.630
to kick his ass and you
pulled the plug. All right,
I have worked with them

37:25.670 --> 37:27.763
for over five years now.
you know what, you don't
know anything. You know

37:27.810 --> 37:29.971
I know them better than you.
how to protect your
meal ticket and that is it.

37:30.010 --> 37:31.773
Why don't you work in the
trenches before you say

37:31.810 --> 37:34.278
that kind...
Why don't you get the hell
off of my campaign?!

37:34.320 --> 37:37.312
This is not
your campaign.

37:42.360 --> 37:44.328
CUESTA:
This is by far the lowest

37:44.360 --> 37:47.284
trick I've seen in all
my years on the bench.
Your Honor?

37:47.330 --> 37:50.754
Don't you dare feign ignorance
with me, Ms. Lockhart.

37:50.800 --> 37:54.634
The fact that you conspired
to waste this court's time

37:54.670 --> 37:56.968
is not only
personally offensive, it's

37:57.000 --> 37:58.706
potentially actionable.
I have no

37:58.740 --> 38:00.002
idea what...
It shows poor
judgment,

38:00.040 --> 38:03.601
tremendous disrespect, and will
deservedly color

38:03.640 --> 38:06.848
every interaction both of you
have in this court and

38:06.880 --> 38:08.745
every court in
the jurisdiction.

38:08.780 --> 38:10.839
Where's your client?
Where the hell is Cary Agos?

38:12.090 --> 38:13.739
(door opens)

38:14.960 --> 38:16.609
I'm here, Your Honor.

38:16.660 --> 38:18.821
Good. Get your ass up
here for sentencing.

38:18.860 --> 38:20.748
DIANE:
Your Honor,

38:20.790 --> 38:23.691
we have found the Brady
violation, and we ask...
Oh, yes,

38:23.730 --> 38:25.789
you have your Brady violation

38:25.830 --> 38:27.468
because you delayed me.
Uh, Your Honor,

38:27.500 --> 38:30.333
with respect, I did
nothing of the kind.

38:30.370 --> 38:32.600
And we insist that you
see this Brady violation.

38:32.640 --> 38:33.959
What did you get?

38:34.010 --> 38:36.570
Kalinda got it. I just pulled it
down from her computer.

38:36.610 --> 38:38.077
Your Honor.

38:38.110 --> 38:39.839
I ask leave to approach?

38:39.880 --> 38:42.348
With great caution, counselor.

38:42.380 --> 38:45.383
As you would a lion in a cage.

38:56.500 --> 38:57.956
Good job.
They're looking at it now.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.968
Looking at what?
What you found.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.991
Diane pulled it
off your computer.

39:03.900 --> 39:05.731
DIANE: This is metadata
from Detective Prima's

39:05.770 --> 39:08.705
account proving
that he saw

39:08.740 --> 39:10.901
the Canadian e-mail.

39:10.940 --> 39:13.101
That is your
Brady violation.

39:20.450 --> 39:22.384
That's a flat-out lie.
DIANE: We have proof,
Your Honor, that Detective

39:22.420 --> 39:24.422
Prima _buried evidence.
(whispers): Diane.
Not once

39:24.460 --> 39:27.918
have I bur_ied evidence.
Diane.
Let me handle this.

39:27.960 --> 39:29.450
This is ridiculous.
How can she just

39:30.960 --> 39:32.598
Is this Morse code?

39:32.630 --> 39:33.767
What am I looking at here?
DIANE: It is

39:33.800 --> 39:35.893
a metadata report
taken from

39:35.940 --> 39:37.089
Detective Prima's computer

39:37.140 --> 39:38.937
proving that he
was in receipt

39:38.970 --> 39:40.437
of information from
the Canadian police.

39:40.470 --> 39:42.438
Geneva, you got
to help me out here.

39:42.480 --> 39:44.846
You know this isn't true.
CUESTA:
Yes, Geneva, help us out here.

39:44.880 --> 39:46.768
Because from where I sit
it looks like

39:46.810 --> 39:48.778
the state's attorney's office

39:48.820 --> 39:52.483
and the Chicago PD are playing
fast and loose with the facts.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.488
The state has new
evidence to submit.

39:54.520 --> 39:56.408
Uh, Your Honor...
I just
received

39:56.460 --> 39:59.054
a statement from
Detective Rodriguez.

39:59.090 --> 40:02.423
Mr. Agos may have been
a victim of entrapment.

40:02.460 --> 40:04.894
Okay, everybody

40:04.930 --> 40:06.420
bring their
evidence up here.

40:06.470 --> 40:07.789
Now.

40:15.140 --> 40:17.074
CARY:
You okay?

40:17.110 --> 40:18.099
Yeah.

40:18.140 --> 40:21.769
Sit down, Ms. Pine. Now.

40:21.820 --> 40:23.674
If your office spent this much

40:23.720 --> 40:26.211
time working within
the confines of the law,

40:26.250 --> 40:28.650
the streets would be
free of criminals.

40:28.690 --> 40:31.113
We move that we be allowed
to retry this, Your Honor.

40:31.160 --> 40:34.084
DIANE:
Excuse me, but we move for an
immediate dismissal, Your Honor.

40:34.130 --> 40:37.054
This is not just
a matter of a cover-up

40:37.100 --> 40:39.489
of the original
investigation,

40:39.530 --> 40:41.634
but the police detective
who received that e-mail

40:41.670 --> 40:42.932
lied to the court.

40:42.970 --> 40:44.631
I did nothing of the kind.
CUESTA: Sit down,

40:44.670 --> 40:46.763
sir, and stop your lying.
I did nothing wrong.

40:46.810 --> 40:48.129
This shows you
did something.

40:48.170 --> 40:51.105
Now sit down
or I'll hold you in contempt.

40:51.140 --> 40:54.974
Okay, here's how
we're doing this.

40:55.020 --> 40:56.715
Mr. Agos.

40:59.990 --> 41:03.949
Please accept my apologies
on behalf of this court

41:03.990 --> 41:06.185
for the egregious
and overzealous

41:06.230 --> 41:08.619
prosecution
you've suffered.

41:08.660 --> 41:10.890
I know these
words don't make up

41:10.930 --> 41:12.966
for the last six
months of your life--

41:13.000 --> 41:14.536
no words
ever can--

41:14.570 --> 41:16.538
but they're
all I have.

41:16.570 --> 41:18.561
And so I will
use them now.

41:20.270 --> 41:24.036
This case is dismissed
with prejudice.
GENEVA: Your Honor--

41:24.080 --> 41:27.049
CUESTA:
No, leave the
poor guy alone.

41:27.080 --> 41:29.548
You're free to
go, Mr. Agos.

41:29.580 --> 41:31.582
With our
apologies.

41:36.120 --> 41:37.815
Thank you,_thank you.
(crying)

41:38.960 --> 41:40.951
(Diane sniffles, laughs)

41:51.170 --> 41:53.809
(phone rings)

41:57.810 --> 41:59.801
Oh, thank you, Kalinda.
(phone continues ringing)

42:04.020 --> 42:06.011
(cries)
Thank you.

42:08.190 --> 42:10.181
Hello. Yeah, Diane,
what happened?

42:14.800 --> 42:17.598
I... Thank you.

42:17.630 --> 42:19.166
Thank you. No, I'm...

42:19.200 --> 42:21.998
Oh, my God, I'm good,
I'm good. I...

42:22.040 --> 42:24.702
Okay. No.

42:24.740 --> 42:26.731
I'll-I'll talk to you.

42:28.170 --> 42:30.172
(short laugh)

42:33.110 --> 42:35.112
(alarm wails)

42:39.390 --> 42:41.585
(alarm stops)

42:45.090 --> 42:47.024
(whoops)

42:47.060 --> 42:48.789
(laughs)

42:48.830 --> 42:51.219
Alicia.

42:51.260 --> 42:53.262
You all right?

42:58.970 --> 43:01.029
* Wake up *

43:06.650 --> 43:08.641
(whoops)

43:10.380 --> 43:13.611
* Hear the plane
humming back on the run... *
