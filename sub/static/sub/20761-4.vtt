04:12.419 --> 04:15.009
Somehow it got in the media
that we were investigating this thing.

04:15.630 --> 04:18.800
And a lot of girls started calling me
and talking to me.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.135
They wanted us to know
that there was credibility,

04:21.219 --> 04:23.179
but they didn't want their names used.

04:23.263 --> 04:26.313
Didn't want their families, husbands,
knowing anything's going on.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.595
And we started rolling from there.

04:30.061 --> 04:32.191
I interviewed over a hundred girls myself.

04:34.149 --> 04:35.479
Firsthand. What happened--

04:35.817 --> 04:38.317
As we were getting into this,
we had to cut it off

04:38.403 --> 04:40.243
because, I mean, we had so many victims,

04:40.322 --> 04:42.412
we were gonna go work
on the best cases.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.659
"Maskell had a police officer pick me up."

04:45.327 --> 04:48.157
"Maskell was running around
with the police, put me in the car."

04:48.246 --> 04:50.706
"Maskell pulled me into his office
and examined me on his desk."

04:51.291 --> 04:54.711
And those were the cases that
we felt we could really do something with.

04:55.253 --> 04:57.133
We believed that we had a credible case.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.971
This is what we call a red ball case.

05:00.050 --> 05:03.600
A red ball case is any case that's
gonna cause national media attention.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.598
So you have to work
with the state's attorney.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.810
So, we were taking it directly to...

05:07.891 --> 05:10.191
Sharon May's office. To Sharon May.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.536
I'm telling you,
Sharon May ran interference for the Church

05:28.620 --> 05:30.000
any time we got a priest case.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.004
She'd kill it.

09:26.191 --> 09:27.691
<i>We get this anonymous thing.</i>

09:27.817 --> 09:31.567
<i>Well, the guy turned out to be this guy</i>
<i>name Storey. Mr. Storey calls up.</i>

09:35.867 --> 09:38.447
<i>He says, "Know where</i>
<i>the farmers' market parking lot is?</i>

09:38.995 --> 09:42.205
<i>Be there at midnight. Come alone.</i>

09:43.041 --> 09:45.751
<i>I got information</i>
<i>that'll blow this case wide open."</i>

09:49.422 --> 09:51.762
<i>So, we go down there on the parking lot.</i>

09:52.592 --> 09:56.012
<i>When he gets in the car and says,</i>
<i>"Start driving." So we do.</i>

09:56.763 --> 09:57.813
<i>We start driving.</i>

10:05.355 --> 10:07.515
<i>And we get to Holy Cross Cemetery.</i>

10:10.276 --> 10:12.646
<i>Oh, it's dark as hell. It's midnight.</i>

10:13.738 --> 10:15.028
<i>He goes, "Go to the back."</i>

10:20.078 --> 10:23.288
<i>"I wanna tell you where I buried</i>
<i>the stuff from Father Maskell."</i>

11:16.092 --> 11:19.352
<i>One of the boxes that I saw</i>
<i>had girls with their shirts open,</i>

11:19.429 --> 11:20.889
<i>exposing their breasts.</i>

11:21.472 --> 11:24.182
<i>And there was records in there</i>
<i>talking about</i>

11:24.267 --> 11:26.387
<i>this individual girl, like a profile.</i>

11:26.978 --> 11:28.268
<i>Clearly in high school.</i>

11:28.354 --> 11:29.694
<i>And it's a lot of boxes.</i>

11:29.772 --> 11:31.152
<i>And they're in plastic bags.</i>

11:31.858 --> 11:33.278
And that's typical pedophile.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.859
A pedophile cannot separate
with his collection.

11:35.987 --> 11:39.527
He can't do it. Even though he knows
he can't get to it, he knows it's there.

11:39.616 --> 11:42.946
-You saw pictures yourself, correct?
-I saw pictures myself, yes, I did.

11:43.036 --> 11:46.206
-Enough to arrest Maskell?
-We could've done it right then and there.

11:46.289 --> 11:49.959
But what I'm saying is... every damn time
we had a case involving a priest,

11:50.043 --> 11:52.213
Sharon May ran interference
for the Church.

11:52.629 --> 11:54.959
She was the division chief
of the Sex Offense Unit.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.178
-She ran interference.
-How did she run interference?

11:57.258 --> 11:59.968
You'd ask for a warrant.
"I'll have to look at it. I don't know."

12:00.053 --> 12:04.183
If you got information, and you don't
get it within the first 48, it's gone.

12:04.891 --> 12:05.731
It's gone.

19:45.476 --> 19:46.726
That's that old doctor.

39:13.768 --> 39:15.598
The top one is my credentials.

39:16.354 --> 39:17.444
My badge.

39:20.108 --> 39:21.568
Here's my retirement.

39:22.402 --> 39:26.532
Summation on my 38 years
in Baltimore County Police.

39:27.115 --> 39:30.535
Came on in 1955 and then retired in '92.

39:40.670 --> 39:42.210
I find it hard to believe.

39:43.464 --> 39:47.474
In our society,
they go for the deep pockets.

39:48.052 --> 39:51.142
And once you open the door,
a flood could come in.

39:52.265 --> 39:54.135
I would say, prove it to me.

39:57.103 --> 39:58.773
Not with recalled memory.

39:59.564 --> 40:00.444
With facts.

40:04.360 --> 40:06.070
Beyond a shadow of a doubt.

40:20.251 --> 40:21.091
I would say so.

40:25.590 --> 40:27.800
I know he had a brother
with the police department.

40:53.159 --> 40:54.079
<i>Joe Maskell.</i>

40:56.621 --> 40:58.671
<i>He was a friend and fellow officer.</i>

40:59.123 --> 41:03.213
<i>He was the chaplain of Baltimore County,</i>
<i>state police,</i>

41:04.003 --> 41:05.423
<i>and the Air National Guard.</i>

41:08.132 --> 41:09.722
<i>He used to come in ride-alongs.</i>

41:10.301 --> 41:13.471
He used to come down
and I'd let him shoot when I was working.

41:14.138 --> 41:15.928
<i>We'd have a little target practice.</i>

41:19.060 --> 41:20.900
He had a friend in Dundalk.

41:21.521 --> 41:23.021
He went out on a boat with him.

41:24.148 --> 41:27.068
<i>In fact, I fished with him</i>
<i>on a couple occasions.</i>

41:46.045 --> 41:47.085
He wasn't a typical...

41:47.755 --> 41:48.795
you know, saint.

41:50.049 --> 41:51.839
I know if I got in a fight...

41:51.926 --> 41:55.676
and he was riding with me as a chaplain,
he'd be there by my side.

41:57.640 --> 42:00.480
That's the type of individual he was.

42:01.436 --> 42:04.936
<i>He's a priest, but I think he really</i>
<i>wanted to be a police like his brother.</i>

42:05.940 --> 42:07.230
<i>He was just like...</i>

42:07.316 --> 42:10.146
any other member of the police force
to me.

42:22.623 --> 42:24.713
I don't think his name ever come up...

42:24.792 --> 42:27.422
until all the recall memory come about.

42:30.214 --> 42:31.764
That's when Maskell's name...

42:31.841 --> 42:34.721
That's when I started getting inquiries...

42:35.011 --> 42:37.221
<i>about Sister Cesnik.</i>

42:39.182 --> 42:41.932
<i>But, you know, I--</i>
<i>I've got to be objective.</i>

42:42.018 --> 42:43.438
<i>I think like a police.</i>

42:47.607 --> 42:49.107
<i>If I thought it was him...</i>

42:50.109 --> 42:52.149
<i>he wouldn't have been walking free.</i>

42:54.489 --> 42:56.779
<i>I would've did</i>
<i>what I was supposed to do.</i>
