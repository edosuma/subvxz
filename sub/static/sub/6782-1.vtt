The Pride Lands.

00:28.194 --> 00:31.897
Ruling it is a big
responsibility, Kiara.

00:31.931 --> 00:33.298
And someday,
when you're Queen...

00:33.333 --> 00:35.200

Kion!

00:37.103 --> 00:40.139
Oh! (CHUCKLES) Sorry, Dad.

00:40.206 --> 00:42.207
Me and Bunga were
playing Baobab Ball...

00:42.242 --> 00:44.910
And Kion couldn't
handle the pass!

00:44.944 --> 00:46.979
What? A giraffe
couldn't handle it.

00:47.013 --> 00:48.247
You kicked it
over my head!

00:48.281 --> 00:51.016
Kion!
And you couldn't handle it!

00:51.051 --> 00:53.118

Yeah? Try to handle this!

Whoa!

00:59.325 --> 01:02.094
Kion, I need to
talk to your sister.

01:02.128 --> 01:04.196
She'll be tracking gazelles
with her friends today.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.865
(CHUCKLES)
Because I'm training to be...

01:06.900 --> 01:09.268
Queen of the Pride Lands.
Yeah, yeah.

01:09.302 --> 01:11.170
I know all
about it, Kiara.

01:11.204 --> 01:15.007
(SCOFFS) Least I have
my life figured out.

01:15.041 --> 01:17.943
What are you gonna grow
up to be, little brother?

01:18.178 --> 01:20.079
Happy?

01:20.113 --> 01:22.848
All right you two,
that's enough.

01:22.882 --> 01:25.217
Kion, why don't you
and Bunga go play
somewhere else?

01:25.251 --> 01:27.986
BUNGA: Yeah! I know
the perfect place!

01:28.021 --> 01:31.857
Hey, Kion!

01:31.891 --> 01:34.126
(IN SING-SONG VOICE)
You'll never get
the baobab fruit, no.

01:34.160 --> 01:37.062

Ha! You got nowhere
to go, Bunga!

01:48.241 --> 01:50.042

01:50.076 --> 01:52.344
Later, Dad.
Have fun tracking
those gazelle, Kiara.

01:52.378 --> 01:53.946
I gotta get Bunga!

01:53.980 --> 01:56.181
(SIGHS) I can't believe
we're related.

you roar like that?

Wish I did, though.

it was un-bunga-lievable!

Eh, no, Rafiki.
He can't possibly be ready.
He's still a cub.

07:16.936 --> 07:19.971
Simba, Simba.
You heard the Roar!

07:20.006 --> 07:22.541
I heard it. It's just...

07:22.575 --> 07:24.576
It's a big responsibility.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.611
I need more time
to prepare him.

07:26.646 --> 07:28.747
I think you've just
run out of time Simba.

07:28.781 --> 07:29.881
You need to tell him.

07:29.916 --> 07:30.916
But, Nala...

07:30.950 --> 07:33.785
Listen to Rafiki, Simba.

07:33.820 --> 07:37.022
Kion is ready.
It is time.

07:44.063 --> 07:46.798
Son, we need to talk...

07:46.833 --> 07:49.868
Oh no. Dad,
we already had that talk.

07:49.902 --> 07:52.003
"Can you feel
the love tonight..."

07:52.038 --> 07:54.739

(CLEARS THROAT)

07:56.676 --> 07:57.943
It's not that, Kion.

07:57.977 --> 08:00.812
No, no.
Most definitely
not that.

08:00.847 --> 08:03.982
We have heard
your Roar! Yes, yes!

08:04.016 --> 08:08.553
Yeah. It was, uh,
kinda different today.

08:08.588 --> 08:10.555
Different?
Different you say?

08:10.590 --> 08:11.790
(CHUCKLES)

08:11.824 --> 08:14.526
It is more
than different.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.796
It is the Roar of the Elders!

08:17.830 --> 08:19.664
When you use it,

08:19.699 --> 08:24.603
the great lions
of the Pride Lands' past
roar with you.

08:24.637 --> 08:27.839
What? You mean that's what
happened to my roar?

08:27.874 --> 08:30.642
Yeah, lions in the sky!
I saw that!

08:30.676 --> 08:33.812
The Roar of the Elders
is a great gift, Kion.

08:33.846 --> 08:37.749
It will make you the fiercest
animal in the Pride Lands.

08:37.783 --> 08:39.784
But...
But what?

08:41.854 --> 08:47.926
No, no, Simba.
It is you who must tell Kion
about the Lion Guard.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.695
The Lion Guard?
What's that?

08:52.598 --> 08:53.865
This way, Kion.

08:55.701 --> 08:56.868
Uh, okay...

09:00.006 --> 09:03.575
Oh, come on, Rafiki.
You already know what it is,
don'cha?

09:03.609 --> 09:05.544
Come on, tell me...

09:07.880 --> 09:08.847
Huh?

09:12.685 --> 09:15.987
It's a bunch of vines?

09:16.022 --> 09:16.988
Rafiki?

09:22.662 --> 09:23.895
Whoa!

09:23.930 --> 09:26.598
Look at that!

09:26.632 --> 09:28.833
How did I not know
this was here?

09:29.835 --> 09:31.670
Dad, what is this place?

09:31.704 --> 09:33.772
This is Lion Guard Lair.

09:33.806 --> 09:36.942
It's the secret meeting
place for the members
of the Lion Guard.

09:36.976 --> 09:40.812
Ugh! Maybe they should think
about fixin' the place up.

09:40.846 --> 09:44.549
(COUGHS) Or at least
do some dusting...

09:44.584 --> 09:46.685
Hmmm... Yes...

09:51.057 --> 09:52.757
(CHUCKLES)

10:00.967 --> 10:02.767
Ah! That's more like it.

10:02.802 --> 10:05.804
Can you show that trick to my
Uncle Timon and Uncle Pumbaa?

10:05.838 --> 10:06.972
(CHUCKLES)

10:07.006 --> 10:09.674
Dad, enough with all
the secrecy stuff!

10:09.709 --> 10:12.877
You gotta tell me.
What is the Lion Guard?

10:12.912 --> 10:16.581
The Lion Guard is the team
that protects the Pride Lands

10:16.616 --> 10:18.717
and defends
the Circle of Life.

10:18.751 --> 10:21.953
According to tradition,
the Lion Guard is made
of the Pride Lands'

10:21.988 --> 10:27.859
fiercest, bravest,
fastest, strongest,
and keenest of sight.

10:27.893 --> 10:29.861
So what happened to them?

10:29.895 --> 10:33.632
It looks like
they haven't been in
here since... Forever!

10:33.666 --> 10:37.702
I'm afraid it's a story
without a happy ending.

10:43.009 --> 10:44.075
Whoa!
Whoa!

10:46.879 --> 10:49.948
SIMBA: When your grandfather
Mufasa was about your age,

10:49.982 --> 10:53.852
his younger brother, Scar,
was leader of the Lion Guard.

10:53.886 --> 10:56.921
Scar also had
the gift of the Roar.

10:56.956 --> 10:59.958
The Roar made Scar
feel powerful.

10:59.992 --> 11:03.561
But that power
went to Scar's head.

11:03.596 --> 11:05.697
He began to think that
he should be king,

11:05.731 --> 11:08.600
instead of his
older brother Mufasa.

11:08.634 --> 11:13.638
So Scar ordered the Lion Guard
to help him take down Mufasa.

11:13.673 --> 11:14.973
When the Guard refused,

11:15.007 --> 11:16.941
Scar was furious.

11:16.976 --> 11:19.711
And then,
Scar used the Roar

11:19.745 --> 11:21.946
to destroy the Lion Guard.

11:21.981 --> 11:23.915
What Scar didn't realize

11:23.949 --> 11:26.584
was that by using
the Roar for evil,

11:26.619 --> 11:29.888
he would lose the power
of the Roar completely.

11:32.658 --> 11:34.059

11:34.093 --> 11:35.660
Yeah...

11:35.695 --> 11:38.897
The Roar is
a very powerful gift.

11:38.931 --> 11:41.666
It can be used
for great good.

11:41.701 --> 11:45.036
But it can also lead
to terrible evil.

11:45.071 --> 11:48.073
Well, I'd never
be like Scar. Ever!

11:48.107 --> 11:50.075
I'm glad
to hear that, son.

11:50.109 --> 11:51.943
Because starting today,

11:51.977 --> 11:55.080
you are the leader
of the new Lion Guard.

11:55.114 --> 11:56.715
I'm the what?

11:56.749 --> 11:58.683
You heard Simba. Ha-ha!

11:58.718 --> 12:01.853
The leader of the
new Lion Guard!
It is you!

12:01.887 --> 12:04.723
Yes! It. Is. You!

12:05.858 --> 12:07.992
Dad?
It's true, Kion.

12:08.794 --> 12:10.962
Wow... Amazing!

12:10.996 --> 12:14.566
It is. And now,
as leader of the Guard,

12:14.600 --> 12:17.869
I need you to assemble
the Pride Lands' bravest,

12:17.903 --> 12:21.740
fastest, strongest,
and keenest of sight.

12:21.774 --> 12:23.708
Okay, Dad. Got it!

12:25.010 --> 12:27.612
Don't worry.
I'm gonna make you proud!

12:29.014 --> 12:30.682
Yes, Bunga?

12:30.716 --> 12:34.753
This is un-bunga-lievable!

12:35.054 --> 12:37.589
You see, Simba?

12:37.623 --> 12:41.893
And now Kion will choose
the best lions in
the Pride for the Guard.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.595
I hope so, Rafiki.

12:43.629 --> 12:44.963
I'm still not sure
he's ready...

12:48.901 --> 12:50.802
(BIRDS CAWING)

12:55.040 --> 12:58.910
Wow! Me!
Leader of the Lion Guard...

12:58.944 --> 13:01.579
Protectors of
the Pride Lands!

13:01.614 --> 13:02.981
It's kinda scary...

13:03.015 --> 13:04.015
Hey, Kion... Kion!
Huh?

13:06.051 --> 13:07.819
Ergh! Bunga!

13:07.853 --> 13:09.788
Ready to start assembling
the Lion Guard?

13:09.822 --> 13:11.756
Huh? Now? Yeah? Huh?

13:11.791 --> 13:13.591
Yes! Augh!

13:13.626 --> 13:14.826
Just stop splashing me!

13:14.860 --> 13:15.994
Splashing?

13:16.028 --> 13:20.665
Oh. (CHUCKLES)
Sorry, Kion.

13:20.699 --> 13:22.967
<i> Hakuna matata, </i> Bunga.
Now c'mon!

13:24.837 --> 13:27.672
Time to assemble
the Lion Guard!

13:31.644 --> 13:32.944
Lion Guard?

13:32.978 --> 13:34.012
Hmm...

13:36.048 --> 13:39.617
Dad said the Lion Guard needs
the Pride Lands' bravest,

13:39.652 --> 13:42.754
strongest, fastest,
and keenest of sight.

13:42.788 --> 13:46.591
So I think I'll go ask
the bravest animal
in the Pride Lands first.

13:46.625 --> 13:47.959
Kion, wait!

13:47.993 --> 13:50.728
Before you go asking
whoever you think is
the bravest,

13:50.763 --> 13:51.930
think about this...

13:51.964 --> 13:54.999
I might not be
the biggest honey badger.

13:55.034 --> 13:57.635
But I know
what's in my heart.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.605
And I'm not afraid
of anything, or anyone!

14:00.639 --> 14:01.973
I know, Bunga.
That's why...

14:02.007 --> 14:04.609
I'll help the Lion Guard
fight hyenas.

14:04.643 --> 14:06.778
Or jackals!
Or crocodiles!
Or vultures!

14:06.812 --> 14:09.814
Vultures?
Or great big rock slides
or wild fires or floods!

14:09.849 --> 14:12.784
I will stand with
the Lion Guard!
I'll never give up!

14:12.818 --> 14:14.752
I'll, I'll...

14:14.787 --> 14:17.655
Why don't you stop talking
so I can ask you to join
the Lion Guard?

14:17.690 --> 14:19.557
Say what...

14:19.592 --> 14:21.793
Come on, Bunga!
You're the bravest
animal I know!

14:21.827 --> 14:24.896
I want you to be
the first to join
the new Lion Guard.

14:24.930 --> 14:27.832
<i> Zuka Zama!</i>

14:27.867 --> 14:29.868
<i> Zuka Zama, </i> indeed.

14:29.902 --> 14:33.638
I wonder if Janja knows
about the Lion Guard...

14:34.807 --> 14:36.040
You couldn't have made
a better choice.

14:36.075 --> 14:38.843
We're gonna make
a great team!

14:38.878 --> 14:41.646
I can't wait to tell
Uncle Timon
and Uncle Pumbaa.

14:41.680 --> 14:42.847
(PANICKED SCREAM IN DISTANCE)

14:42.882 --> 14:44.849
Kion! Do you hear that?

14:46.018 --> 14:48.653
ZURI: (STRAINING)
...little help?

14:48.687 --> 14:50.622
Sounds like
Kiara's friend, Zuri...

14:50.656 --> 14:52.690
And she needs help.

14:52.725 --> 14:53.791
Our help!

14:53.826 --> 14:55.760
It's our first adventure!

14:55.794 --> 14:59.631
Lion Guard to the rescue!

14:59.665 --> 15:01.599
Lion Guard to the rescue?

15:01.634 --> 15:03.701
Hey! Bunga, wait up!

15:05.421 --> 15:05.687
Hold still, Zuri.
Timon and Pumbaa said
they know how to help.

15:08.457 --> 15:10.525
(WHINING)
Where am I gonna go, Tiifu?

15:10.559 --> 15:12.427
I'm stuck...

15:12.461 --> 15:14.495
(SIGHS) You wouldn't
be stuck

15:14.530 --> 15:17.398
if you didn't keep
stopping to sharpen your
claws on every other tree.

15:17.433 --> 15:21.469
But Kiara, if I don't
keep them sharp,
they don't stay shiny!

15:21.503 --> 15:22.770
TIMON: Don't worry, ladies.

15:22.805 --> 15:26.441
Me and Pumbaa have
everything under control.

15:26.475 --> 15:28.376
Timon's right.

15:28.410 --> 15:32.413
We used to help Simba
get his claws
out of logs all the time.

15:32.448 --> 15:34.582
And you're sure about this?

15:34.617 --> 15:36.684
Sure, I'm sure.

15:36.719 --> 15:39.721
If it weren't for us,
your dad would still be
stuck to a tree somewhere.

15:39.755 --> 15:42.423
Ready, Pumbaa?
Ready!

15:42.458 --> 15:44.359
Okay, on three.

15:44.393 --> 15:46.527
One... Two...

15:46.562 --> 15:48.730
BUNGA: Stand back,
Pride Landers!

15:48.764 --> 15:52.400
Bunga of the Lion Guard
is here!

15:52.434 --> 15:53.434
What!

15:53.469 --> 15:54.702
Bunga!
(ZURI GASPS)

15:54.737 --> 15:58.606
Ow! My claw! Whoa...

15:58.641 --> 15:59.641
(LOUD CRASH)

15:59.675 --> 16:01.309
(ZURI SCREAMING)

16:01.343 --> 16:03.277
Creepy crawly bugs!

16:03.312 --> 16:04.579
(BUZZING)
Ew!

16:04.613 --> 16:06.681
Zuri! You hit the jackpot!

16:06.715 --> 16:08.683
It's smorgasbord!

16:10.719 --> 16:12.420
(MUFFLES MOANS)

16:12.454 --> 16:14.589
Hang on, Zuri!
I'll save you!

16:14.623 --> 16:16.591
Okay, Bunga.

16:16.625 --> 16:19.293
You've done enough
saving for one day.

16:19.328 --> 16:20.528
Bunga, I...

16:20.562 --> 16:21.562
Whoa.

16:23.499 --> 16:25.366
What's going on?

16:25.401 --> 16:27.669
Oh! I broke a claw!

16:27.703 --> 16:29.404
It hurts!

16:29.438 --> 16:32.373
There, there, Zuri.
You're gonna be just fine.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.709
Oh, hey, Kiara.
How'd the gazelle
tracking go?

16:34.743 --> 16:36.778
(SIGHS) We never
got to the gazelles.

16:36.812 --> 16:39.480
Zuri got her claws
stuck in a tree.

16:39.515 --> 16:44.519
(LAUGHS) And then she
fell face first into
a log full of bugs!

16:44.553 --> 16:45.653
Mmm, mmm, mmm!

16:45.688 --> 16:48.356
Bugs are so gross!

16:48.657 --> 16:49.724
Mmm...

16:49.758 --> 16:52.360
And so delicious!

16:52.394 --> 16:53.361
Ooh, look.

16:54.830 --> 16:56.564
Another one.
(SCREAMS)

16:56.598 --> 16:57.765
Get it, get it away!

16:57.800 --> 16:59.500
(CONTINUES SCREAMING)

16:59.535 --> 17:01.402
Ow, my paw!

17:01.437 --> 17:03.471
(SOBBING)

17:03.505 --> 17:07.508
Hey, everyone. Everyone!
Listen to this!

17:07.543 --> 17:09.744
Simba just put Kion

17:09.778 --> 17:13.347
in charge of
the new Lion Guard!

17:13.382 --> 17:14.482
Lion Guard?

17:14.516 --> 17:15.616
What's a Lion Guard?

17:15.651 --> 17:17.485
Dad just told me
about it.

17:17.519 --> 17:20.321
The Lion Guard
is the team that protects
the Pride Lands

17:20.355 --> 17:22.457
and defends
the Circle of Life!

17:22.491 --> 17:24.425
And I'm it's new leader!

17:24.460 --> 17:26.360
I'm gonna be
on the Lion Guard, too!

17:26.395 --> 17:28.629
It's un-Bunga-lievable!

17:28.664 --> 17:30.631
(CHUCKLES)
You and Bunga?

17:30.666 --> 17:32.600
Protecting the Pride Lands?

17:32.634 --> 17:34.769
Does Dad know about this?

17:34.803 --> 17:38.439
"Dad" told me to assemble
the Pride Lands' best.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.508
And I'm the best.
Just ask me!

17:40.542 --> 17:43.711
Well, if you ask me,
it sounds like it
might be dangerous.

17:43.746 --> 17:46.314
It's worse
than that, Pumbaa.

17:46.348 --> 17:48.416
It sounds like work.

17:48.450 --> 17:50.585
Yeah! It's both!

17:50.619 --> 17:52.487
Eek... Work!

17:52.521 --> 17:54.655
Gee, Bunga. I dunno...

17:54.690 --> 17:58.359
Uncle Pumbaa,
Uncle Timon, please?

17:58.393 --> 18:01.262
Work? Danger?
Definitely not.

18:01.296 --> 18:04.599
Have you forgotten
our problem-free philosophy?

18:04.633 --> 18:06.501
It means no worries...

18:06.535 --> 18:09.470
I know it's not

I still don't think Bunga
should be signing up
for some jungle patrol.

20:27.409 --> 20:29.610
Lion Guard!
Whatever you call it.

20:29.645 --> 20:31.612
Timon, Pumbaa, please.

20:31.647 --> 20:33.681
I really do need Bunga
on the Lion Guard.

20:33.715 --> 20:36.384
He's the bravest
animal I know.

20:36.418 --> 20:38.486
Bravest animal you know?

20:38.520 --> 20:40.421
He's brave, all right.

20:40.455 --> 20:42.423
Brave bordering on stupid.

20:42.457 --> 20:43.524
Thanks, Kiara!

20:43.558 --> 20:45.593
Well, when you
put it that way...

20:45.627 --> 20:47.595
Congratulations, Bunga!

20:47.629 --> 20:49.664
We always knew
you had it in you!

20:49.698 --> 20:51.632
Oh, brother!

20:51.667 --> 20:55.369
Kion's gonna wreck
the Pride Lands before
I even get to be Queen.

20:55.404 --> 20:57.571
Oh, Bunga. I'm so proud,
I could...

20:57.606 --> 20:59.373
(BREAKS WIND)

20:59.408 --> 21:00.374
Oops.

21:00.742 --> 21:02.543
Sorry.

21:02.577 --> 21:05.313
Zuri, let's get you
back to Pride Rock.

21:05.347 --> 21:06.514
We're outta here!

21:06.548 --> 21:08.549
I better go assemble
the rest of my team...

21:08.583 --> 21:11.786
Wait, Kion! The Lion Guard
needs to stick together!

21:13.488 --> 21:15.456
Was it something
I said?

21:22.481 --> 21:25.449
Janja, I'm hungry!

21:25.484 --> 21:27.151
Me, too!

21:27.185 --> 21:29.320
You two only have
yourselves to blame.

21:29.354 --> 21:33.024
To think that you were scared
by the roar of a lion cub!

21:33.058 --> 21:36.060
Janja, see, Kion's roar,

21:36.094 --> 21:39.363
it wasn't like,
like a normal roar.

21:39.398 --> 21:43.467
It was, uh...
(NERVOUS LAUGH) Super loud!

21:43.502 --> 21:48.272
And the clouds!
They turned into
roaring lions!

21:50.242 --> 21:52.243
Oh! So you're
scared of clouds, too?

21:52.277 --> 21:54.011
(LAUGHING)

21:56.048 --> 21:57.281
Stuff it, fur brains!

21:57.316 --> 22:00.418
Seems we have a visitor
to our humble humid den.

22:00.452 --> 22:03.120
Janja. Hyenas.

22:03.155 --> 22:07.124
Mzingo! What are you doing
this far into the Outlands?

22:07.159 --> 22:08.359
Looking for leftovers?

22:08.393 --> 22:11.062
No, but I'd be
happy to eat...

22:11.096 --> 22:13.130
Forget it.
We don't have any.

22:13.165 --> 22:16.267
Simba's cub, Kion,
managed to cancel
our lunch plans.

22:16.301 --> 22:18.102
(LAUGHING)

22:18.136 --> 22:20.971
Then you already
know about Kion.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.206
Know what?

22:22.240 --> 22:27.211
Simba has told Kion
to assemble
a new Lion Guard.

22:27.245 --> 22:30.081
Lion Guard?
That's impossible.

22:30.115 --> 22:32.983
The Lion Guard
died out after Scar...

22:33.352 --> 22:35.052
Unless...

22:35.087 --> 22:36.253
(STAMMERS) Janja?

22:36.288 --> 22:39.156
The Roar! Of course!

22:39.191 --> 22:40.324
Of course what?

22:40.359 --> 22:42.159
Don't you know the stories?

22:42.194 --> 22:44.261
The Lion Guard
was legendary.

22:44.296 --> 22:48.299
The most powerful team
of lions in the Pride Lands.

22:48.333 --> 22:51.102
At least they were...
(SNICKERING)

22:51.136 --> 22:54.071
Until Scar destroyed them!

22:54.106 --> 22:56.340
(LAUGHING)

22:56.375 --> 22:59.310
What? A lion destroyed
the Lion Guard?

22:59.344 --> 23:01.178
Or so the story goes.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.347
Ha-ha-hilarious!

23:03.382 --> 23:07.084
Yeah! Them lions
ain't too bright!

23:08.253 --> 23:10.154
Stuff it, fur brains!

23:10.188 --> 23:14.425
A new Lion Guard
could be very bad news
for us hyenas.

23:14.459 --> 23:17.094
And all the other
Outlanders.

23:17.129 --> 23:20.264
I gathered as much
from what I overheard
from Kion.

23:20.298 --> 23:26.203
Yes. The old Lion Guard
protected the so-called
Circle of Life.

23:26.238 --> 23:30.107
If Kion's new Lion Guard wins
the trust of the Pride Lands,

23:30.142 --> 23:32.143
we Outlanders will...

23:32.177 --> 23:33.411
(GROWLS)

23:37.182 --> 23:38.416
(HYENAS LAUGHING)

23:46.358 --> 23:48.392
Now, Janja.
What were you saying?

23:48.427 --> 23:51.996
About the Lion Guard
and the Outlanders?

23:52.030 --> 23:53.230
I was saying...

23:53.265 --> 23:55.399
With a Lion Guard
patrolling the Pride Lands,

23:55.434 --> 23:58.302
it will be next to impossible
for us Outlanders

23:58.336 --> 24:00.404
to take whatever
animals we want for food.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.339
Then what're
we gonna do?

24:02.374 --> 24:04.375
Ooh, we could
eat each other.

24:04.409 --> 24:07.144
No! We'll strike now.

24:07.179 --> 24:09.980
Before the Lion Guard
is ready.

24:10.015 --> 24:13.083
And we'll take down
all the animals we can.

24:13.118 --> 24:15.286
Mmm. I like
the sound of that.

24:15.320 --> 24:17.321
Whole herds of animals!

24:17.355 --> 24:19.990
Yeah, right!
Tasty!

24:21.259 --> 24:24.261
Tonight, we Outlanders
will feast.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.330
Hyenas and vultures alike!

24:26.364 --> 24:29.333

Kion wants to talk!

27:51.202 --> 27:53.103
Not now, Bunga.
I gotta run.

27:53.138 --> 27:54.238
What? Why?

27:54.272 --> 27:56.206
(PANTING) That's why.

I said I'm sorry!

28:39.017 --> 28:41.285

Hey, guys.
Thanks for meeting with me.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.956
I wanted to
talk to you because...

28:45.990 --> 28:47.391
Well, I need your help.

28:47.459 --> 28:49.293
What's the kerbubble, Kion?

28:49.327 --> 28:51.995
The five of us are
the Pride Lands' fiercest,

28:52.030 --> 28:57.067
bravest, strongest, fastest
and keenest of sight.

28:57.102 --> 29:01.238
And that's why
I want you all to join
the new Lion Guard.

29:01.272 --> 29:05.943
Together, we'll protect
the Pride Lands and defend
the Circle of Life.

29:05.977 --> 29:10.180
(WHISTLES)
Well, lick my tail
and call me a meerkat!

29:10.215 --> 29:12.382
Hey! My uncle's a meerkat!

29:12.417 --> 29:14.218
No offense, Bunga...

29:14.252 --> 29:16.253
Wait! Aren't you
a honey badger?

29:17.188 --> 29:19.189
A Lion Guard?

29:19.224 --> 29:20.924
Figures.

29:20.959 --> 29:24.128
Always the lions lording
over the Pride Lands.

29:24.162 --> 29:28.165
I suppose Simba
put you in charge of
this little team, Kion?

29:28.199 --> 29:31.001
You bet your spots he did!

29:31.035 --> 29:32.369
Fuli, the Lion Guard
needs you.

29:32.403 --> 29:34.071
You're the Pride Lands'
fastest.

29:34.105 --> 29:35.239
You got that right.

29:35.273 --> 29:38.142
And you're supposed
to be the fiercest?

29:38.176 --> 29:39.977
Well, he is a lion...

29:40.011 --> 29:41.378
And lions are fierce.

29:41.412 --> 29:43.280
It's kinda common
knowledge, really...

29:43.314 --> 29:46.016
Show 'em the Roar, Kion.
Show 'em the Roar!

29:46.050 --> 29:48.385
What's Bunga talking about?
The Roar?

29:48.419 --> 29:53.290
You think you're somethin'
special just 'cause
you can roar?

29:53.324 --> 29:56.026
Wait 'till you hear it.
C'mon, Kion.

29:56.060 --> 29:57.161
Show 'em the Roar!

29:57.195 --> 30:00.097
So what is the deal
with your roar?

30:00.131 --> 30:03.267
Oh, you totally
have to show us, Kion.

30:03.301 --> 30:05.068
Seeing is believing!

30:05.103 --> 30:06.403
Though with a roar,
it's more about hearing...

30:07.438 --> 30:10.307
Okay, fine.
I'll show you the Roar.

30:10.341 --> 30:13.076
Just, uh, stay behind me.

30:13.111 --> 30:15.112
I don't want
anybody to get hurt.

30:15.146 --> 30:17.347
'Scuse me.
Watch it!

30:17.382 --> 30:18.348
Pfft. Groundlings...

30:20.385 --> 30:21.385
Ready?

30:23.121 --> 30:25.455
Okay. This is the Roar...

30:27.492 --> 30:29.259
(TINY SQUEAK)

30:29.294 --> 30:31.195
What in the Pride Lands...

30:31.229 --> 30:33.197
That was... Different.

30:33.231 --> 30:35.332
(LAUGHS) Kion!

30:35.366 --> 30:38.302
You call that a roar?
(CHUCKLES)

30:38.336 --> 30:40.204
Didn't sound like a roar.

30:40.238 --> 30:43.240
That wasn't the Roar!
That was a squeak!

30:43.274 --> 30:45.142
I've found him,
Your Highness!

30:45.176 --> 30:46.443
Kion is over here!

30:46.477 --> 30:48.445
See, Dad?
What did I tell you?

30:48.479 --> 30:50.180
Thank you, Kiara.

30:50.215 --> 30:52.216
You and Tiifu go ahead
and track the gazelle.

30:52.250 --> 30:54.384
I need to talk
with Kion. Alone.

30:54.419 --> 30:55.419
Yes, Dad.

30:55.453 --> 30:57.187
Thank you, princess.

30:57.222 --> 30:59.957
Dad! Am I glad
to see you!

30:59.991 --> 31:01.358
I'm not sure why,
but when I tried to...

31:01.392 --> 31:06.163
Kion, Kiara tells me
you've asked Bunga
to join the Lion Guard.

31:06.197 --> 31:07.331
Hey...

31:07.365 --> 31:08.966
Is this true?

31:09.000 --> 31:10.200
Well, yeah.

31:10.235 --> 31:12.369
I was just talking to all
my friends about it.

31:12.403 --> 31:14.137
Your friends?

31:14.172 --> 31:17.441
Kion, I asked you to assemble
the new Lion Guard.

31:17.475 --> 31:20.277
Instead you're just
playing with your friends?

31:20.311 --> 31:21.979
I'm not playing, Dad.

31:22.013 --> 31:23.447
My friends are
the new Lion Guard.

31:23.481 --> 31:25.249
Fuli is the fastest.

31:25.283 --> 31:27.017
Beshte is the strongest.

31:27.051 --> 31:28.986
Ono is the keenest of sight.

31:29.020 --> 31:31.355
And the bravest, it's Bunga.

31:31.389 --> 31:36.260
Kion, the Lion Guard has
always been made of lions.

31:36.294 --> 31:39.997
Do you really
think a Lion Guard
with only one lion

31:40.064 --> 31:41.231
can protect the Pride Lands?

31:41.266 --> 31:44.001
Well, actually...
Son, listen.

31:44.035 --> 31:47.170
The Lion Guard isn't a game
you play with your friends.

31:47.205 --> 31:48.272
It's real.

31:48.306 --> 31:50.440
The Circle of Life,
and your life,

31:50.475 --> 31:53.076
will depend on
who's on your team.

31:53.111 --> 31:56.446
Please, Kion.
There are plenty of
good lions for the Guard.

31:56.481 --> 32:00.951
I need you to take your
new responsibility seriously.

32:00.985 --> 32:03.253
Just as seriously
as Kiara takes hers.

32:08.059 --> 32:10.360
But I do take it seriously...

32:10.395 --> 32:12.129
Kion...

32:12.163 --> 32:15.299
Lil' B, I think Kion needs
some time to himself.

32:20.772 --> 32:23.907
KIARA: Be sure to
stay low while we're
tracking the herd.

32:23.942 --> 32:27.010
And we need stay downwind,
so they don't catch our scent.

32:27.045 --> 32:30.013
That's why it's important
to watch how the grass moves.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.784
Are we going
to attack them?

32:33.818 --> 32:38.088
No. My dad says
we should only take
what the pride needs,

32:38.122 --> 32:40.057
to keep the Circle
of Life in balance.

32:40.091 --> 32:42.993
If we took down gazelles
just to learn how to do it,

32:43.027 --> 32:44.962
pretty soon there
wouldn't be any left.

32:44.996 --> 32:47.097
Then we'd be
as bad as the hyenas.

32:47.131 --> 32:48.165
(GASPS)

32:48.199 --> 32:50.133
What's Mzingo doing up there?

32:50.168 --> 32:53.904

when they're expecting to eat.

32:53.938 --> 32:55.238
Kiara, look!

32:55.273 --> 32:58.041
KIARA: Hyenas.
And Janja's leading them.

32:58.076 --> 32:59.943
TIIFU:
There's so many of them!

32:59.978 --> 33:03.914
Yeah. And with Mzingo
circling over the gazelles,

33:03.948 --> 33:05.882
I have a feeling
they're up to no good.

33:05.917 --> 33:07.718
What are we
going to do?

33:07.752 --> 33:10.153
Go find my dad and tell him
Janja and his clan are here.

33:10.188 --> 33:11.855
I'll stay here
and keep watch.

33:11.889 --> 33:13.991
Okay, Kiara. Be careful!

33:23.935 --> 33:26.136
Dad wanted the best
for the Lion Guard.

33:26.170 --> 33:27.938
And I found them.

33:27.972 --> 33:31.008
But now, maybe the best
isn't good enough?
