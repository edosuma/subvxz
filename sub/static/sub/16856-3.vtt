00:05.072 --> 00:06.471
Hey, blake,
you're a hunter?

00:06.474 --> 00:09.308
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Pheasant. Check this out.

00:09.310 --> 00:10.876
[ bird call sounds ]

00:10.878 --> 00:12.711
That's not what
pheasant sounds like.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.380
No, pheasant's more like,
"bl-bl-bl."

00:14.382 --> 00:15.681
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,
beep, beep.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.116
No, I think you're both
wrong, actually.

00:17.118 --> 00:18.117
It's more like,
"ha-ha-ha-haaaa."

00:18.119 --> 00:19.585
Close.
Bird!

[ gunshot ]

00:33.566 --> 00:36.235
Hi. Can I have
your attention, please?

00:36.237 --> 00:38.037
Gather 'round.
All right.

00:38.039 --> 00:41.874
Now, insurance requires
that all of us take a dna test

00:41.876 --> 00:45.177
In order to find out if any of
us are genetically predisposed

00:45.179 --> 00:46.678
To malpractice.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.414
I accept that premise
at face value.

00:48.416 --> 00:50.349
Gene.
Good morning.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.885
My name is gene,
and I am a geneticist,

00:52.887 --> 00:55.654
So, yes, I've heard
all the jokes before.

00:58.258 --> 00:59.725
What jokes are those?

00:59.727 --> 01:03.529
You see, my name is gene,
and I'm a geneticist.

01:03.531 --> 01:07.032
"gene" is the first four letters
in "geneticist."

01:07.034 --> 01:08.467
Oh. [ laughs ]

01:08.469 --> 01:10.002
Oh. [ laughing ] okay!
Oh, wow.

01:10.004 --> 01:12.271
That is like
"other level" funny.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.973
Thank you, gene, for sharing
that type of humor.

01:14.975 --> 01:17.709
All right, before we begin,
I have to warn you,

01:17.711 --> 01:20.779
A lot of people get freaked out
when they get their results.

01:20.781 --> 01:24.316
Sometimes the secrets locked
within our genetic blueprints

01:24.318 --> 01:25.517
Can be traumatizing.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.786
In fact,
I took a dna test years ago,

01:27.788 --> 01:30.089
But after the lives
I've seen ruined,

01:30.091 --> 01:33.025
I decided to never open
my results.

01:33.027 --> 01:34.426
Bored!
Can we just do this thing?

01:34.428 --> 01:35.828
It's your funeral.

01:35.830 --> 01:37.162
Now, I'm going to need
you all to spit...

Can you just angle it
towards us a little bit?

"attention staff. A
reminder that all doctorrs on
duty should be

01:49.043 --> 01:52.611

01:54.615 --> 01:56.148
Don't say
I didn't warn you.

01:56.150 --> 01:57.449
Well, I promise I won't,

01:57.451 --> 01:58.484
But I can't promise you

01:58.486 --> 01:59.918
That I won't tell everybody

01:59.920 --> 02:02.621
That "gene geneticist" joke

02:02.623 --> 02:05.023
[ laughing ]
I mean, that is too good.

02:05.025 --> 02:06.859
Mine says,

02:09.896 --> 02:11.330
I'm subject 34.

02:11.332 --> 02:12.998
Can you explain this
in a way

02:13.000 --> 02:14.333
That you don't need a medical
degree to understand, please?

02:14.335 --> 02:15.701
But you do have a medi--

02:15.703 --> 02:17.703
Nothing. Forget it.

It means you two

02:31.252 --> 02:32.351
I thought he died.

02:32.353 --> 02:33.752
Well, apparently not.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.354
But, you know,
this does add up.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.589
With all of the moon rocks
on my desk,

02:37.591 --> 02:38.991
I'm always
wearing a diaper,

02:38.993 --> 02:41.660
And with my memory of walking
on the moon.

02:41.662 --> 02:44.429
[ gasps ]
I have liver failure?

02:44.431 --> 02:46.064
I'm gonna die.

02:46.066 --> 02:47.466
I have a liver surplus.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.168
What?
Look here. It says,

02:49.170 --> 02:50.869
"two healthy livers."

02:50.871 --> 02:53.272
Well, then you can just give me
one of your livers!

02:53.274 --> 02:54.773
[ gasps ] perfect!
Oh, my god.

02:54.775 --> 02:58.143
Oh!
Oh, wait a minute. Ohh.

02:58.145 --> 03:02.181
It also says that I have
a deficiency of generosity.

03:23.771 --> 03:26.305

in a way.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.573
We both became doctors.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.208
We both have
medium-sized heads.

Wow. We have a lot
to catch up on.

03:37.351 --> 03:38.984

of our parents is a liar.

Yeah! And are you a clown,
or am I a not-a-clown?

It also doesn't matter
what our jeans say.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.495
I am not paying double
for designer jeans

08:50.497 --> 08:52.731
Just so the label
can say "calvin klein"

08:52.733 --> 08:55.033
Or "gloria vanderbilt"
or whatever.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.568
It doesn't matter

08:56.570 --> 08:59.304
If I have sociopathically
low levels of generosity.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.939
Let's go get you a liver.

09:00.941 --> 09:03.041
Oh, my god.
Thank you, dori!

09:03.043 --> 09:05.210
[ both laugh ]

09:05.212 --> 09:07.913
Wow.
That was so inspirational.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.614
So.
Yeah.

09:09.616 --> 09:12.484
You guys want to go up to the
roof and kill ourselves still?

09:12.486 --> 09:13.885
Sure.
Oh, yeah.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.387
Let's do it.
I do too.

09:15.389 --> 09:17.522
Wait! Wait a minute!
There's been a mistake!

09:17.524 --> 09:19.891
I mixed up your samples
with another group of doctors

09:19.893 --> 09:21.493
And neil armstrong.

09:21.495 --> 09:22.594
How can you be
so stupid?

09:22.596 --> 09:24.663
I don't know.
Then let's find out.

09:24.665 --> 09:27.432
No, don't touch that!
Those are my private results.

09:28.301 --> 09:31.469
[ gasps ] 100% proclivity
to stupidity.

09:31.471 --> 09:34.439
Oh, okay. All right.
I guess that's that.

09:34.441 --> 09:37.409
So...We're <i> not</i> related?

09:37.411 --> 09:40.378
No. No, I guess not.
So...?

09:40.380 --> 09:43.181
No.
No, right?

09:43.183 --> 09:46.017
Sy: So I'm <i> not</i>
neil armstrong.

09:46.019 --> 09:50.088
But I just so remember
walking on the moon.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.823
Oh, of course.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.458
I did the moonwalk

09:53.460 --> 09:56.428
At the motown
25th-anniversary special.
Oh.

09:56.430 --> 09:59.331
Chet: Okay, so,
when am I going to die?

09:59.333 --> 10:01.366
Oh, Tuesday,
the 15th. Good.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.234
Now I have to move
that lunch date

10:03.236 --> 10:04.469
Back to the original date,

10:04.471 --> 10:06.104
Which is fine
but kind of annoying.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.973
It says
I'm 100% selfish.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.541
Together: Yeah, me too.

10:09.543 --> 10:12.210
I think we learned something
here today, guys.

10:12.212 --> 10:17.148
Me, chet, sy, val.

10:17.150 --> 10:20.285
Of course, who can't forget
lola and dori?

10:20.287 --> 10:24.422
The people who aren't here --
glenn, owen, chief, beth.

10:24.424 --> 10:26.491
Then you sort of have
the next level down.

10:26.493 --> 10:28.593
You have, uh,
detective chance briggs,

10:28.595 --> 10:32.530
Sir tinkle button,
um, dr. Brian.

10:32.532 --> 10:35.567
And then you got, uh --
who else, who else?

10:35.569 --> 10:38.703
Oh, rabbi mcjewy.
Yeah, that's the other one.
