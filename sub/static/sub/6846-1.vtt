01:57.283 --> 01:58.716
Dismount!

02:04.991 --> 02:07.425
Herman's horse-sick!

02:14.067 --> 02:17.059
Chaps, no one wander off.

02:17.137 --> 02:20.300
Some of the passageways
in here can run for miles.

02:30.617 --> 02:33.711
l don't think
this is such a good idea.

02:37.190 --> 02:38.885
What is it?

03:04.050 --> 03:05.642
Alfred, did you
get anything yet?

03:05.718 --> 03:06.650
Nothing.

03:06.719 --> 03:07.708
Then keep digging.

03:07.787 --> 03:08.754
The kid's got something!

03:08.821 --> 03:11.483
Whoo! Yee-hoo!

03:11.558 --> 03:12.547
l got something, Garth!

03:12.625 --> 03:15.185
l got something...
l got something right here.

03:21.801 --> 03:23.291
Oh, look at that!

03:23.369 --> 03:24.529
Whoo!

03:24.604 --> 03:25.571
We're rich! We're rich!

03:25.638 --> 03:27.435
Shut up. Shut up.

03:27.507 --> 03:28.735
Well, we're rich, ain't we?

03:30.276 --> 03:33.439
lndy...

03:33.513 --> 03:34.775
lndy?

03:34.847 --> 03:36.542
What are they doing?

03:36.616 --> 03:39.107
lndiana? lndiana?

03:39.185 --> 03:41.016
Shh!

03:44.257 --> 03:46.350
Hey, we got to find
more stuff to bring back.

03:46.426 --> 03:48.417
lt's the Cross of Coronado.

03:48.494 --> 03:51.088
Cortez gave it to him
in 1 520.

03:51.164 --> 03:52.791
Ah! Oh, boy! Whoo!

03:52.865 --> 03:55.333
l'm thinkin' about
raisin' my dead mama,

03:55.401 --> 03:57.835
dig down and put it on
her bony finger!

03:57.904 --> 04:00.338
That cross
is an important artifact.

04:00.406 --> 04:01.998
lt belongs in a museum.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.633
Run back
and find the others.

04:03.710 --> 04:07.043
Tell Mr. Havelock that there are
men looting in the caves.

04:07.113 --> 04:08.205
Have him bring
the sheriff.

04:08.281 --> 04:10.112
lt's only a snake.

04:10.183 --> 04:11.878
Did you hear what l said?

04:11.951 --> 04:13.350
Right. Run back...

04:13.419 --> 04:15.751
Mr. Havelock...
the sheriff...

04:15.822 --> 04:18.017
What, what are you
gonna do?

04:18.091 --> 04:19.285
l don't know.

04:19.358 --> 04:20.986
l'll think
of something.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.399
Dig with your hands,

04:27.467 --> 04:28.866
not with your mouth.

04:44.317 --> 04:45.409
He's got our thing!

04:45.485 --> 04:47.146
-Get him!
-Get off me!

04:52.825 --> 04:54.156
Mr. Havelock!

04:54.227 --> 04:55.159
Anybody!

04:55.228 --> 04:57.355
Everybody's lost but me.

04:57.430 --> 04:58.522
There he is!

04:58.598 --> 05:00.156
Let's go! Let's go!

05:16.749 --> 05:18.512
-Hey! Hey, you!
-Dang it!

05:21.821 --> 05:23.652
Hyah! Hyah!

05:23.723 --> 05:24.712
Hey!

05:24.791 --> 05:26.782
Come back here!

05:39.238 --> 05:40.535
Come on! Get him!

05:49.048 --> 05:50.606
Hey, come back here!

06:12.405 --> 06:14.032
Oh!

06:41.100 --> 06:42.431
Aah... Oh!

06:57.383 --> 06:58.441
Here, let me.

07:03.890 --> 07:05.721
Oh, oh...

07:36.122 --> 07:38.522
Holy smokes!

08:01.380 --> 08:03.439
Come on, kid.

08:05.251 --> 08:07.446
There's no way out of this.

08:21.701 --> 08:24.135
Hey!

08:40.453 --> 08:41.885
Toss up the whip.

08:51.731 --> 08:53.824
You got heart, kid,
but that belongs to me.

08:53.900 --> 08:55.162
lt belongs to Coronado.

08:55.234 --> 08:56.496
Coronado is dead,

08:56.569 --> 08:58.628
and so are all
of his grandchildren.

08:58.704 --> 09:01.036
This should be in a museum.

09:01.107 --> 09:02.096
Now give it back!

09:04.677 --> 09:07.111
A snake!

09:07.179 --> 09:08.111
Snake! Aah!

09:08.180 --> 09:09.374
Don't let him get away!

09:11.584 --> 09:12.642
Magic?

09:14.687 --> 09:15.619
Hold it.

09:15.688 --> 09:17.485
Make sure he
doesn't double back.

09:33.839 --> 09:36.569
Okay, kid,
out of the box, now.

09:37.977 --> 09:39.342
Son of a...

09:50.089 --> 09:52.080
Damn.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.600
Dad!

10:06.839 --> 10:08.932
Dad!

10:09.075 --> 10:10.042
Dad.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.210
Dad... Out.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.211
lt's important.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.907
Then wait.
Count to 20.

10:15.982 --> 10:17.415
No, Dad. You listen to me.

10:17.483 --> 10:18.415
Junior!

10:18.484 --> 10:19.917
One, two, three, four...

10:19.986 --> 10:21.920
ln Greek.

10:33.499 --> 10:37.731
''May he who illuminated this...

10:37.803 --> 10:39.634
illuminate me.''

10:44.677 --> 10:46.975
l brought the sheriff.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.645
Just the man l want to see.

10:49.715 --> 10:51.615
Now, there were five
or six of them...

10:51.684 --> 10:52.708
-lt's all right, son.
-They came after me...

10:52.785 --> 10:53.911
You still got it?

10:53.986 --> 10:55.146
Well, yes, sir.

10:55.221 --> 10:56.745
lt's right here.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.483
l'm glad to see that...

10:58.557 --> 11:01.492
because the rightful
owner of this cross

11:01.560 --> 11:04.552
won't press charges
if you give it back.

11:04.630 --> 11:08.122
He's got witnesses,
five or six of them.

11:19.445 --> 11:21.276
Whoo! Yeah!

11:31.691 --> 11:33.318
Good day.

11:38.397 --> 11:40.456
You lost today, kid,

11:40.533 --> 11:44.299
but it doesn't mean
you have to like it.

12:10.696 --> 12:12.755
Small world, Dr. Jones.

12:12.832 --> 12:15.062
Too small for two of us.

12:23.275 --> 12:24.572
This is the second time

12:24.643 --> 12:26.941
l've had to reclaim
my property from you.

12:27.079 --> 12:29.172
That belongs in a museum.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.944
So do you.

12:32.084 --> 12:33.711
Throw him over the side.

13:21.600 --> 13:24.000
Grab him, he's getting away!
Stop him!

14:17.723 --> 14:20.283
Archaeology is the search

14:20.359 --> 14:22.725
for fact...

14:25.064 --> 14:26.725
...not truth.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.391
lf it's truth
you're interested in,

14:28.467 --> 14:31.095
Dr. Tyree's philosophy class
is right down the hall.

14:32.538 --> 14:33.937
So forget any ideas you've got

14:34.073 --> 14:35.665
about lost cities,
exotic travel,

14:35.741 --> 14:36.935
and digging up the world.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.805
We do not follow maps
to buried treasure,

14:38.878 --> 14:42.370
and ''X'' never, ever,
marks the spot.

14:45.017 --> 14:47.281
Seventy percent
of all archaeology is done

14:47.353 --> 14:48.615
in the library.

14:48.687 --> 14:51.656
Research. Reading.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.818
We cannot afford
to take mythology

14:54.894 --> 14:56.327
at face value.

14:58.530 --> 15:00.225
Next week: ''Egyptology.''

15:00.299 --> 15:02.597
Starting with the excavation
of Naukratis

15:02.668 --> 15:04.192
by Flinders Petrie in 1 885.

15:04.270 --> 15:05.294
l will be in my office

15:05.371 --> 15:06.736
if anybody's got
any problems,

15:06.805 --> 15:08.136
for the next hour
and a half.

15:14.380 --> 15:16.746
Marcus, l did it.

15:16.815 --> 15:19.045
You've got it!

15:26.258 --> 15:28.590
Oh!

15:28.661 --> 15:30.856
You know how long l've
been looking for that?

15:30.930 --> 15:32.659
All your life.

15:32.731 --> 15:34.221
All my life.

15:34.300 --> 15:35.392
Well done, lndy.

15:35.467 --> 15:37.128
Very well done, indeed.

15:37.202 --> 15:40.933
This will find a place of honor
in our Spanish collection.

15:41.073 --> 15:42.938
We can discuss
my honorarium

15:43.008 --> 15:45.340
over dinner and
champagne tonight.

15:45.411 --> 15:46.571
Your treat.

15:46.645 --> 15:47.942
Yes.

15:48.047 --> 15:50.174
My treat.

15:53.352 --> 15:55.513
Dr. Jones!
Dr. Jones!

15:59.058 --> 16:00.958
Shush! Shush! Shush!

16:01.060 --> 16:02.789
Dr. Jones, l am so glad
you're back.

16:02.861 --> 16:04.158
Your mail is on your desk.

16:04.229 --> 16:05.628
Here are your
phone messages.

16:05.698 --> 16:07.222
Dr. Jones, you promised...

16:07.299 --> 16:08.664
This is your
appointment schedule,

16:08.734 --> 16:10.759
and these term papers still
haven't been graded.

16:10.836 --> 16:12.667
Okay. lrene,
put everybody's name on a list,

16:12.738 --> 16:13.898
get the order they arrived...

16:14.006 --> 16:15.132
Oh, come on, Dr. Jones.

16:15.207 --> 16:16.299
Dr. Jones.

16:16.375 --> 16:18.900
...and l'll see each
and every one of them...

16:18.978 --> 16:20.445
in turn.

16:31.924 --> 16:34.392
''Venice, ltaly.''

17:02.988 --> 17:04.853
Dr. Jones!

17:10.194 --> 17:12.163
Dr. Jones?

17:27.980 --> 17:31.177
l trust your trip down
was comfortable, Dr. Jones.

17:31.250 --> 17:34.219
Uh, my men didn't alarm you,
l hope.

17:34.286 --> 17:36.220
My name is Donovan.

17:36.288 --> 17:37.380
Walter Donovan.

17:37.456 --> 17:38.684
l know who you are,
Mr. Donovan.

17:38.757 --> 17:40.054
Your contributions
to the museum

17:40.125 --> 17:41.922
over the years have
been extremely generous.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.153
Some of the pieces

17:43.228 --> 17:45.059
in your collection here
are very impressive.

17:45.130 --> 17:46.859
Well, like yourself,
Dr. Jones,

17:46.932 --> 17:48.729
l have a passion
for antiquities.

17:48.801 --> 17:50.769
Have a look over here.

17:52.805 --> 17:55.273
This might interest you.

17:57.309 --> 17:59.277
Well, it's sandstone.

17:59.344 --> 18:00.936
Christian symbol.

18:01.046 --> 18:02.877
Early Latin text.

18:02.981 --> 18:05.449
Mid-1 2th century,
l should think.

18:05.517 --> 18:07.451
That was our
assessment, as well.

18:07.519 --> 18:08.884
Where did this come from?

18:08.954 --> 18:10.251
My engineers
unearthed it

18:10.322 --> 18:12.381
in the mountain region
north of Ankara

18:12.458 --> 18:13.891
while excavating
for copper.

18:14.026 --> 18:15.926
Can you translate
the inscription?

18:19.298 --> 18:22.734
''...who drinks the water
l shall give him, says the Lord,

18:22.801 --> 18:26.066
''will have a... spring

18:26.138 --> 18:29.630
''inside him welling up
for eternal life.

18:31.910 --> 18:34.208
''Let them bring me
to your holy mountain

18:34.279 --> 18:36.042
''in the place where you dwell.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.207
''Across the desert

18:37.282 --> 18:39.307
''and through the mountain

18:39.384 --> 18:41.409
''to the Canyon
of the Crescent Moon,

18:41.487 --> 18:44.581
to the temple
where the cup that... ''

18:47.993 --> 18:50.257
''Where the cup
that holds the blood

18:50.329 --> 18:54.197
of Jesus Christ resides
forever.''

18:54.266 --> 18:57.929
The Holy Grail, Dr. Jones.

18:58.003 --> 19:01.996
The chalice used by Christ
during the Last Supper.

19:02.074 --> 19:05.305
The cup that caught His blood
at the Crucifixion

19:05.377 --> 19:09.074
and was entrusted to
Joseph of Arimathea.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.082
The Arthur legend.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.880
l've heard this
bedtime story before.

19:14.019 --> 19:15.281
Eternal life, Dr. Jones!

19:15.354 --> 19:17.686
The gift of youth to whoever
drinks from the Grail.

19:18.891 --> 19:21.416
Now, that's a bedtime story
l'd like to wake up to.

19:21.493 --> 19:22.517
An old man's dream.

19:22.594 --> 19:24.289
Every man's dream,

19:24.363 --> 19:26.388
including your
father's, l believe.

19:29.535 --> 19:31.469
Grail lore is his hobby.

19:31.537 --> 19:33.528
He's a teacher
of medieval literature.

19:33.605 --> 19:35.800
The one the students hope
they don't get.

19:35.874 --> 19:38.900
Walter, you're neglecting
your guests.

19:38.977 --> 19:41.537
Be along in a moment, dear.

19:46.618 --> 19:48.779
Hard to resist, isn't it?

19:48.854 --> 19:52.221
The Holy Grail's final resting
place described in detail.

19:52.291 --> 19:54.384
What good is it?

19:54.459 --> 19:56.450
This grail tablet
speaks of deserts

19:56.528 --> 19:58.155
and mountains and canyons.

19:58.230 --> 19:59.322
lt's pretty vague.

19:59.398 --> 20:01.332
Where do you want
to start looking?

20:01.400 --> 20:04.164
Maybe if the tablet were intact,
you'd have something to go on,

20:04.236 --> 20:05.863
but the entire top portion
is missing.

20:05.938 --> 20:06.927
Just the same, an attempt

20:07.039 --> 20:08.939
to recover the Grail
is currently underway.

20:11.476 --> 20:15.071
Let me tell you another
bedtime story, Dr. Jones.

20:15.147 --> 20:18.048
After the Grail was entrusted
to Joseph of Arimathea,

20:18.116 --> 20:20.676
it disappeared, and was lost
for a thousand years

20:20.752 --> 20:22.083
before it was found again

20:22.154 --> 20:24.145
by three knights
of the First Crusade.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.747
Three brothers, to be exact.

20:25.824 --> 20:27.792
l've heard this one, as well.

20:27.859 --> 20:31.659
Two of these brothers walked
out of the desert 1 50 years

20:31.730 --> 20:33.630
after having found the Grail

20:33.699 --> 20:36.600
and began the long journey
back to France,

20:36.668 --> 20:38.693
but only one of them made it.

20:38.770 --> 20:41.238
And before dying
of extreme old age,

20:41.306 --> 20:43.467
he supposedly imparted
his tale

20:43.542 --> 20:46.238
to a... to a Franciscan friar,
l think.

20:46.311 --> 20:49.439
Not ''supposedly,''
Dr. Jones.

20:49.514 --> 20:50.845
This is the manuscript

20:50.916 --> 20:53.908
in which the friar chronicled
the knight's story.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.510
lt doesn't reveal

20:55.587 --> 20:57.179
the location of the Grail,
l'm afraid,

20:57.256 --> 20:58.314
but the knight promised

20:58.390 --> 21:00.688
that two markers, that had been
left behind, would.

21:00.759 --> 21:03.626
This tablet is one
of those markers.

21:03.695 --> 21:06.687
lt proves
the knight's story is true.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.824
But as you pointed out,
it's incomplete.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.663
Now, the second marker
is entombed

21:10.736 --> 21:12.397
with the knight's dead brother.

21:12.471 --> 21:14.063
Our project leader

21:14.139 --> 21:16.130
believes that tomb to be located

21:16.208 --> 21:18.233
within the city
of Venice, ltaly.

21:20.312 --> 21:22.803
As you can now see,
Dr. Jones,

21:22.881 --> 21:25.941
we're about
to complete a great quest

21:26.084 --> 21:28.951
that began almost
2,000 years ago.

21:29.054 --> 21:30.487
We're only one step away.

21:30.555 --> 21:32.955
That's usually
when the ground falls out

21:33.058 --> 21:34.685
from underneath your feet.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.388
You could be more right
than you know.

21:37.462 --> 21:38.759
Yes?

21:38.830 --> 21:41.162
We've hit a snag.

21:41.233 --> 21:43.793
Our project leader has vanished,

21:43.869 --> 21:45.962
along with all his research.

21:46.071 --> 21:47.333
Uh, we received a cable

21:47.406 --> 21:49.237
from his colleague,
Dr. Schneider,

21:49.308 --> 21:51.173
who has no idea
of his whereabouts

21:51.243 --> 21:52.574
or what's become of him.

21:52.644 --> 21:56.205
l want you to pick up the trail
where he left off.

21:56.281 --> 22:00.684
Find the man,
and you will find the Grail.

22:00.752 --> 22:03.186
You've got
the wrong Jones,

22:03.255 --> 22:04.586
Mr. Donovan.

22:05.991 --> 22:07.925
Why don't you try my father?

22:07.993 --> 22:09.927
We already have.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.486
Your father is the man
who has disappeared.

22:23.642 --> 22:26.133
Your father and l have been
friends since time began.

22:26.211 --> 22:27.473
l've watched you grow up, lndy.

22:27.546 --> 22:29.138
l've watched
the two of you grow apart.

22:29.214 --> 22:31.375
l've never seen you this
concerned about him before.

22:31.450 --> 22:33.714
Dad?

22:33.785 --> 22:34.945
He's an academic;
a bookworm.

22:35.053 --> 22:36.145
He's not a field man.

22:36.221 --> 22:38.155
Dad? Dad?

22:38.223 --> 22:40.453
Dear God.

22:42.661 --> 22:45.755
What has the old fool
got himself into now?

22:45.831 --> 22:47.765
l don't know,

22:47.833 --> 22:50.427
but whatever it is,
he's in over his head.

22:50.502 --> 22:52.436
Dad?

22:52.504 --> 22:54.199
lt's today's mail,

22:54.272 --> 22:56.467
and it's been opened.

22:57.542 --> 22:59.476
Mail.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.512
That's it, Marcus.

23:03.515 --> 23:05.506
Venice, ltaly.

23:08.320 --> 23:10.447
What is it?

23:12.991 --> 23:14.959
lt's Dad's Grail diary.

23:16.728 --> 23:18.355
Every clue he followed.

23:18.430 --> 23:19.829
Every discovery he made.

23:19.898 --> 23:22.958
A complete record of his search
for the Holy Grail.

23:24.469 --> 23:26.562
This is his whole life.

23:26.638 --> 23:28.833
Why would he have
sent this to me?

23:28.907 --> 23:30.704
l don't know,

23:30.776 --> 23:34.542
but someone must want it
pretty badly.

23:42.954 --> 23:45.582
Do you believe, Marcus?

23:57.402 --> 24:01.202
Do you believe
the Grail actually exists?

24:01.273 --> 24:03.571
The search for the Cup of Christ

24:03.642 --> 24:06.668
is the search for the divine
in all of us.

24:06.745 --> 24:08.372
But if you want facts, lndy,

24:08.447 --> 24:09.846
l've none to give you.

24:09.915 --> 24:11.473
At my age, l'm prepared

24:11.550 --> 24:13.643
to take a few
things on faith.

24:19.491 --> 24:21.425
Call Donovan, Marcus.

24:21.493 --> 24:23.552
Tell him l'll take
that ticket to Venice now.

24:25.997 --> 24:28.261
l'll tell him
we'll take two.

24:33.338 --> 24:35.806
All right, tell me what's going
to happen when we get to Venice.

24:35.874 --> 24:38.138
Don't worry, Dr. Schneider
will be there to meet you.

24:38.210 --> 24:39.472
-Uh, Schneider?
-l maintain

24:39.544 --> 24:41.205
an apartment in Venice.
lt's at your disposal.

24:41.279 --> 24:42.371
Oh, well, that's good.

24:42.447 --> 24:44.415
Thank you.

24:45.450 --> 24:47.384
Dr. Jones... good luck.

24:47.452 --> 24:49.215
Now be very careful.

24:49.287 --> 24:51.380
Don't trust anybody.

25:24.990 --> 25:26.082
Signora?

25:26.157 --> 25:28.284
Signorina?

25:34.332 --> 25:36.266
Ah, Venice...

25:36.334 --> 25:37.562
Yes.

25:37.636 --> 25:40.104
Uh, how will we recognize
this Dr. Schneider

25:40.171 --> 25:41.331
when we see him?

25:41.406 --> 25:43.340
l don't know.

25:43.408 --> 25:44.705
Maybe he'll know us.

25:44.776 --> 25:47.609
Dr. Jones?

25:47.679 --> 25:48.771
Yes?

25:48.847 --> 25:51.042
l knew it was you.

25:51.116 --> 25:54.108
You have your father's eyes.

25:55.720 --> 25:59.520
And my mother's ears,
but the rest belongs to you.

25:59.591 --> 26:02.719
Looks like the best parts have
already been spoken for.

26:02.794 --> 26:04.352
Marcus Brody?

26:04.429 --> 26:06.056
That's right.

26:06.131 --> 26:07.428
Dr. Elsa Schneider.

26:07.499 --> 26:08.727
Oh, how do you do?

26:08.800 --> 26:11.894
The last time l saw your father,
we were in the library.

26:12.037 --> 26:12.901
He was very close

26:13.038 --> 26:15.006
to tracking down
the knight's tomb.

26:15.073 --> 26:16.870
l've never seen him so excited.

26:16.942 --> 26:18.739
He was as giddy as a schoolboy.

26:18.810 --> 26:20.744
Who? Attila
the Professor?

26:20.812 --> 26:22.245
He was never giddy,

26:22.314 --> 26:24.509
even when he was
a schoolboy.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.643
Fraulein, will
you permit me?

26:27.719 --> 26:28.811
l usually don't.

26:28.887 --> 26:30.218
l usually
don't, either.

26:30.288 --> 26:31.414
ln that case,
l permit you.

26:31.489 --> 26:32.615
lt would make
me very happy.

26:32.691 --> 26:33.623
But l'm already sad.

26:33.692 --> 26:35.023
By tomorrow,
it will have faded.

26:35.093 --> 26:36.424
Tomorrow l'll
steal you another.

26:36.494 --> 26:37.791
l hate to interrupt you,

26:37.862 --> 26:39.090
but the reason
we're here...

26:39.164 --> 26:40.597
Yes. l have something
to show you.

26:40.665 --> 26:42.496
l left your father working
in the library.

26:42.567 --> 26:43.829
He sent me to the map section

26:43.902 --> 26:45.494
to fetch an ancient plan
of the city.

26:45.570 --> 26:47.765
When l got back to his table,
he'd gone, with all his papers,

26:47.839 --> 26:50.034
except for that scrap,
which l found near his chair.

26:50.108 --> 26:52.076
Roman numerals.

26:52.177 --> 26:54.168
Here is the library.

26:54.245 --> 26:56.736
That doesn't look much
like a library.

26:56.815 --> 26:59.511
Looks like a
converted church.

26:59.584 --> 27:01.518
ln this case,
it's the literal truth.

27:01.586 --> 27:03.451
We are on holy ground.

27:03.521 --> 27:04.988
These columns over here

27:05.056 --> 27:07.183
were brought back
as spoils of war

27:07.258 --> 27:10.523
after the sacking of Byzantium
during the Crusades.

27:10.595 --> 27:12.062
Now, please excuse me.

27:12.130 --> 27:14.758
The library's closing
in a few moments.

27:14.833 --> 27:17.700
l'll arrange for us
to stay a little longer.

27:20.772 --> 27:24.173
Marcus... l've seen
this window before.

27:24.242 --> 27:25.675
Where?

27:25.744 --> 27:28.269
Right here,
in Dad's diary.

27:36.087 --> 27:37.247
You see?

27:37.322 --> 27:38.846
Look, lndy.

27:38.923 --> 27:40.914
The Roman numerals.

27:40.992 --> 27:43.324
Dad was onto something here.

27:43.395 --> 27:45.295
Well, now we know
the source of the numbers,

27:45.363 --> 27:47.092
but we still don't know
what they mean.

27:47.165 --> 27:49.326
Dad sent me this
diary for a reason.

27:49.401 --> 27:50.493
Until we find
out why,

27:50.568 --> 27:51.933
l suggest we keep
it to ourselves.

27:52.037 --> 27:53.129
Find something?

27:53.204 --> 27:54.762
Uh, yes.
Three, seven and ten.

27:54.839 --> 27:56.670
That window seems
to be the source

27:56.741 --> 27:57.935
of the Roman numerals.

27:58.009 --> 27:59.408
My God,
l must be blind.

27:59.477 --> 28:02.344
Dad wasn't looking for a book
about the knight's tomb,

28:02.414 --> 28:04.279
he was looking
for the tomb itself.

28:04.349 --> 28:05.782
Don't you get it?

28:05.850 --> 28:07.579
The tomb is somewhere
in the library.

28:07.652 --> 28:09.586
You said yourself
it used to be a church.

28:09.654 --> 28:10.882
Look.

28:10.955 --> 28:13.253
Three.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.494
Three.

28:16.561 --> 28:17.721
Seven.

28:17.796 --> 28:20.356
Seven. Ten.

28:20.432 --> 28:22.367
And ten.

28:22.434 --> 28:24.994
Now where's the ten?

28:25.070 --> 28:27.630
Look around for the ten.

28:35.280 --> 28:38.807
Three and seven.

28:38.883 --> 28:40.851
Seven and seven

28:40.919 --> 28:43.285
and ten.

29:02.574 --> 29:04.565
Ten.

29:04.642 --> 29:08.305
''X'' marks the spot.

30:05.870 --> 30:06.859
Bingo.

30:06.938 --> 30:08.530
You don't disappoint,
Dr. Jones.

30:08.606 --> 30:10.233
You're a great deal
like your father.

30:10.308 --> 30:11.935
Except he's lost,
and l'm not.

30:12.043 --> 30:13.135
Lower me down.

30:23.354 --> 30:25.345
Look after this for me,
will you?

30:39.671 --> 30:40.729
Come on.

30:48.346 --> 30:49.870
Pagan symbols.

30:49.948 --> 30:51.245
Fourth or fifth century.

30:51.316 --> 30:52.408
Right.

30:52.483 --> 30:55.247
600 years before
the Crusades.

30:55.320 --> 30:57.686
The Christians would have
dug their own passages

30:57.755 --> 30:59.518
and burial chambers
centuries later.

30:59.591 --> 31:01.081
That's right.

31:01.159 --> 31:03.423
lf there's a knight of
the First Crusade down here,

31:03.494 --> 31:05.462
that's where we'll find him.

31:37.428 --> 31:38.520
What's this one?

31:39.597 --> 31:40.621
The Ark of the Covenant.

31:40.698 --> 31:41.756
Are you sure?

31:41.833 --> 31:43.232
Pretty sure.

32:00.852 --> 32:02.251
Watch out.

32:17.969 --> 32:19.163
lt's petroleum.

32:19.237 --> 32:22.001
l should sink
a well down here and retire.

32:38.589 --> 32:40.022
Give me the lighter.

32:50.201 --> 32:51.793
Oh, rats.

32:51.869 --> 32:52.893
Ugh!

33:07.752 --> 33:09.481
Come on.

33:58.169 --> 33:59.466
Come here.

34:07.245 --> 34:09.509
Look, it...

34:09.580 --> 34:10.672
it must be one of these.

34:10.748 --> 34:11.908
Look at the artistry

34:12.016 --> 34:15.577
of these carvings,
and the scrollwork.

34:30.802 --> 34:33.134
lt's this one.

34:48.252 --> 34:49.947
This is it.

34:50.054 --> 34:51.418
We found it.

34:53.791 --> 34:54.849
Look.

34:56.494 --> 34:58.485
The engraving on the shield,

34:58.563 --> 35:01.657
it's the same
as on the Grail tablet.

35:03.167 --> 35:04.998
The shield is the second marker.

35:05.069 --> 35:06.559
What's that?

35:06.637 --> 35:08.571
lt's a rubbing

35:08.639 --> 35:11.574
Dad made
of the Grail tablet.

35:11.642 --> 35:14.202
Just like your father--
giddy as a schoolboy.

35:15.313 --> 35:16.837
Wouldn't it be wonderful

35:16.914 --> 35:18.973
if he were here now
to see this?

35:20.551 --> 35:22.678
He never would have
made it past the rats.

35:22.753 --> 35:23.913
He hates rats.

35:24.055 --> 35:26.319
He's scared to death of them.

35:47.345 --> 35:48.710
Get back!

35:48.779 --> 35:50.337
Back against the wall.

35:55.119 --> 35:55.915
Quick! Under it!

35:55.987 --> 35:57.352
Air pocket!

36:02.994 --> 36:04.427
Don't wander off.

36:04.495 --> 36:05.519
What?

36:05.596 --> 36:06.824
What?!

36:25.750 --> 36:27.411
l think l've found
a way out.

36:27.485 --> 36:28.952
Deep breath.

36:46.270 --> 36:48.431
Ah, Venice.

37:20.438 --> 37:21.735
Whoa!

37:54.639 --> 37:56.664
Are you crazy?!
Don't go between them!

37:56.741 --> 37:59.642
Go between them?
Are you crazy?!

38:10.554 --> 38:12.044
l said go around!

38:12.123 --> 38:13.886
You said
go between them!

38:13.991 --> 38:16.152
l said,
don't go between them!

39:19.123 --> 39:20.385
No!

39:25.663 --> 39:27.688
Why are you
trying to kill us?

39:27.765 --> 39:29.323
Because you're looking
for the Holy Grail.

39:29.400 --> 39:31.630
My father was looking
for the Holy Grail.

39:31.702 --> 39:32.828
Did you kill him too?

39:32.903 --> 39:33.835
No.

39:33.904 --> 39:35.633
Where is he?

39:35.706 --> 39:38.174
Talk or you're dead.

39:38.242 --> 39:39.834
Damn it, tell me!

39:39.910 --> 39:41.138
Tell me!

39:41.212 --> 39:43.840
lf you don't let go, Dr. Jones,
we'll both die.

39:43.914 --> 39:45.905
Then we'll die.

39:46.050 --> 39:49.019
My soul is prepared.
How's yours?

39:50.688 --> 39:52.246
This is your last chance.

39:52.323 --> 39:55.315
No, Dr. Jones, it's yours.

40:10.875 --> 40:13.708
All right, where's my father?

40:13.778 --> 40:16.542
lf you let me go,
l will tell you where he is.

40:16.614 --> 40:18.479
Who are you?

40:18.549 --> 40:20.483
My name is Kazim.

40:20.551 --> 40:22.041
And why were you
trying to kill me?

40:22.119 --> 40:23.848
The secret of the Grail

40:23.921 --> 40:26.253
has been safe
for a thousand years,

40:26.323 --> 40:28.223
and for all that time,

40:28.292 --> 40:30.760
the Brotherhood of
the Cruciform Sword

40:30.828 --> 40:35.629
have been prepared
to do anything to keep it safe.

40:36.967 --> 40:38.901
Let me off
at this jetty.

40:42.039 --> 40:46.408
Ask yourself, why do you
seek the Cup of Christ?

40:46.477 --> 40:49.810
ls it for His glory,
or for yours?

40:49.880 --> 40:52.508
l didn't come
for the Cup of Christ.

40:52.583 --> 40:54.483
l came to find my father.

40:54.552 --> 40:57.953
ln that case,
God be with you in your quest.

40:58.022 --> 41:00.889
Your father is being held
in the Castle of Brunwald,

41:00.958 --> 41:03.324
on the Austrian-German border.

41:12.069 --> 41:13.434
How's the head?

41:13.504 --> 41:16.234
lt's better,
now l've seen this.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.571
lt's the name of a city.

41:18.642 --> 41:20.200
''Alexandretta''?

41:21.479 --> 41:22.878
Hmm...

41:22.947 --> 41:24.812
The knights of the First Crusade

41:24.882 --> 41:28.079
laid siege to the city
of Alexandretta for over a year.

41:28.152 --> 41:30.780
The entire city was destroyed.

41:32.790 --> 41:36.487
The present city of lskenderun
is built on its ruins.

41:38.429 --> 41:40.693
Marcus, you remember
what the Grail tablet said:

41:40.764 --> 41:43.232
''Across the desert
and through the mountain

41:43.300 --> 41:45.427
to the Canyon
of the Crescent Moon.''

41:48.472 --> 41:50.599
But where exactly?

41:50.674 --> 41:52.335
Your father would know.

41:52.409 --> 41:53.341
Mm.

41:53.410 --> 41:55.844
Your father did know.

41:55.913 --> 41:57.437
Look. He made a map.

41:57.515 --> 41:59.278
He must have
pieced it together

41:59.350 --> 42:00.681
from clues
scattered through

42:00.751 --> 42:02.548
the whole history
of the Grail quest.

42:02.620 --> 42:03.746
A map with no names.

42:03.821 --> 42:05.482
Now, he knew there
was a city

42:05.556 --> 42:07.251
with an oasis
due east, here.

42:07.324 --> 42:08.313
He knew the course

42:08.392 --> 42:10.189
turned south through
the desert to a river,

42:10.261 --> 42:12.092
and the river led
into the mountains, here.

42:12.162 --> 42:13.629
Straight to the canyon.

42:13.697 --> 42:16.165
He knew everything
except where to begin,

42:16.233 --> 42:17.860
the name of the city.

42:19.837 --> 42:21.395
Alexandretta.

42:21.472 --> 42:22.461
Now we know.

42:22.540 --> 42:23.939
Yes. Now we know.

42:24.074 --> 42:25.439
Marcus, get hold of Sallah.

42:25.509 --> 42:26.908
Tell him to meet you
in lskenderun.

42:26.977 --> 42:27.944
What about you?

42:28.012 --> 42:29.411
l'm going after Dad.

42:50.801 --> 42:52.769
Elsa?

42:57.942 --> 43:00.877
Elsa? Elsa?

43:00.945 --> 43:02.742
Oh! Oh...

43:11.088 --> 43:12.385
My room...

43:12.456 --> 43:14.219
Mine, too.

43:14.291 --> 43:16.054
What were they
looking for?

43:16.126 --> 43:17.593
This.

43:17.661 --> 43:19.151
The Grail diary?

43:19.229 --> 43:20.753
Uh-huh.

43:20.831 --> 43:22.628
You had it?

43:22.700 --> 43:24.531
You didn't trust me.

43:24.602 --> 43:26.593
l didn't know you.

43:26.670 --> 43:29.537
At least l let you tag along.

43:29.607 --> 43:30.801
Oh, yes.

43:30.874 --> 43:33.707
Give them a flower,
and they'll follow you anywhere.

43:35.112 --> 43:37.103
Knock it off. You're not mad.

43:37.181 --> 43:38.648
No?

43:38.716 --> 43:40.946
No. You like
the way l do things.

43:41.051 --> 43:44.077
lt's lucky l don't do
things the same way.

43:44.154 --> 43:46.782
You'd still be standing
at the Venice pier!

43:46.857 --> 43:49.382
Look, what do you think
is going on here?

43:49.460 --> 43:52.486
Since l met you,
l've nearly been incinerated,

43:52.563 --> 43:55.361
drowned, shot at,
and chopped into fish bait.

43:55.432 --> 43:57.957
We're caught in the middle
of something sinister here.

43:58.035 --> 44:00.663
My guess is Dad found out
more than he was looking for.

44:00.738 --> 44:01.670
And until l'm sure,

44:01.739 --> 44:03.297
l'm going to
continue to do things

44:03.374 --> 44:05.171
the way l think
they should be done.

44:08.612 --> 44:11.809
How dare you kiss me!

44:17.187 --> 44:20.520
Leave me alone.
l don't like fast women.

44:20.591 --> 44:22.058
And l hate...

44:22.126 --> 44:25.527
arrogant men.

44:34.972 --> 44:36.496
Ah, Venice.

45:08.572 --> 45:10.904
What do you know
about this place?

45:11.008 --> 45:14.409
l know the Brunwalds
are famous art collectors.

45:16.113 --> 45:17.740
What are you going to do?

45:17.815 --> 45:18.907
Don't know.

45:18.982 --> 45:20.279
l'll think of something.

45:28.192 --> 45:29.523
Yes?

45:29.593 --> 45:31.254
And not before time!

45:31.328 --> 45:32.386
Did you intend to leave us

45:32.463 --> 45:33.794
standing on
the doorstep all day?

45:33.864 --> 45:34.831
We're drenched!

45:36.567 --> 45:38.694
Now look, l've gone
and caught a sniffle.

45:38.769 --> 45:39.861
Are you expected?

45:39.937 --> 45:42.269
Do not take that tone
with me, my good man.

45:42.339 --> 45:44.364
Now buttle off
and tell Baron Brunwald

45:44.441 --> 45:47.569
that Lord Clarence MacDonald
and his lovely assistant...

45:48.912 --> 45:51.176
...are here to view
the tapestries.

45:51.248 --> 45:52.306
Tapestries?

45:52.382 --> 45:54.077
Dear me,
the man is dense.

45:54.151 --> 45:55.948
This is a castle,
isn't it?

45:56.019 --> 45:57.452
There are tapestries?

45:57.521 --> 45:59.614
This is a castle,

45:59.690 --> 46:02.284
and we have
many tapestries.

46:02.359 --> 46:04.827
But if you are
a Scottish lord,

46:04.895 --> 46:07.830
then l am Mickey Mouse!

46:07.898 --> 46:09.991
How dare he?

46:36.059 --> 46:39.392
Nazis. l hate these guys.

46:52.242 --> 46:54.403
This one. l think
he's in here.

46:54.478 --> 46:55.604
How do you know?

46:55.679 --> 46:57.772
Because it's wired.

47:25.676 --> 47:28.144
lndy? lndy?

47:28.212 --> 47:31.045
Don't worry...
this is kid's play.

47:31.114 --> 47:32.775
l'll be right back.

47:55.606 --> 47:58.302
Junior?

47:58.375 --> 48:00.673
Yes, sir.

48:00.744 --> 48:02.075
lt is you, Junior!

48:02.145 --> 48:04.238
Don't call me that,
please.

48:04.314 --> 48:06.646
Well, what are you
doing here?

48:06.717 --> 48:08.344
l came to get you.
What do you thi...?

48:18.595 --> 48:21.621
Late 1 4th century,
Ming dynasty.

48:21.698 --> 48:24.064
Oh, it breaks the heart.

48:24.134 --> 48:26.728
And the head.
You hit me, Dad.

48:26.803 --> 48:29.101
l'll never forgive myself.

48:29.172 --> 48:31.572
Don't worry, l'm fine.

48:31.642 --> 48:33.837
Thank God.

48:36.813 --> 48:39.805
lt's fake.

48:39.883 --> 48:44.217
See, you can tell
by the cross section.

48:44.655 --> 48:45.383
No!

48:45.455 --> 48:46.581
Dad, get your stuff.

48:46.657 --> 48:48.284
We've got to get
out of here.

48:48.358 --> 48:50.656
Well, l'm sorry about
your head, though,

48:50.727 --> 48:52.752
but l thought you
were one of them.

48:52.829 --> 48:55.320
Dad, they come in
through the doors.

48:56.366 --> 48:57.390
Good point.

48:57.467 --> 48:59.867
But better safe
than sorry.

48:59.937 --> 49:01.802
Hmm, so l was wrong this time.

49:01.872 --> 49:05.308
But, by God, l wasn't wrong
when l mailed you my diary.

49:05.375 --> 49:06.672
You obviously got it.

49:08.612 --> 49:11.172
l got it, and l used it.

49:11.248 --> 49:14.684
We found the entrance
to the catacombs.

49:14.751 --> 49:16.218
Through the library?

49:16.286 --> 49:18.186
Right.

49:21.224 --> 49:23.249
l knew it.

49:23.327 --> 49:24.885
And the tomb of Sir Richard?

49:24.962 --> 49:27.590
Found it.

49:27.664 --> 49:30.929
He was actually there?

49:32.803 --> 49:34.395
You saw him?

49:34.471 --> 49:37.440
Well, what was
left of him.

49:37.507 --> 49:39.372
And his shield...

49:39.443 --> 49:43.880
the inscription on
Sir Richard's shield?

49:43.947 --> 49:45.915
''Alexandretta.''

49:46.016 --> 49:48.280
Alexandretta! Of course!

49:48.352 --> 49:52.584
On the pilgrim trail
from the Eastern Empire.

49:52.656 --> 49:53.623
Oh...

49:53.690 --> 49:57.592
Junior, you did it.

49:57.661 --> 49:59.925
No, Dad. You did.

49:59.997 --> 50:01.624
Forty years.

50:01.698 --> 50:04.826
Oh, if only l could have been
with you.

50:04.901 --> 50:06.732
There were rats,
Dad.

50:06.803 --> 50:08.100
Rats?

50:08.171 --> 50:09.433
Yeah, big ones.

50:09.506 --> 50:12.100
What do the Nazis
want with you, Dad?

50:12.175 --> 50:13.335
They wanted my diary.

50:13.410 --> 50:14.741
Yeah?

50:14.811 --> 50:18.212
l knew l had to get that book
as far away from me

50:18.281 --> 50:19.714
as l possibly could.

50:21.585 --> 50:23.644
Yeah.

50:27.891 --> 50:29.552
Dr. Jones.

50:29.626 --> 50:30.923
Yes?

50:33.430 --> 50:35.728
l will take the book now.

50:35.799 --> 50:39.257
What book?

50:39.336 --> 50:41.736
You have the diary
in your pocket.

50:41.805 --> 50:45.400
You dolt!

50:45.475 --> 50:47.409
Do you think my son
would be that stupid

50:47.477 --> 50:49.445
that he would
bring my diary

50:49.513 --> 50:51.105
all the way back here?

50:52.182 --> 50:53.809
You didn't, did you?

50:53.884 --> 50:56.250
You didn't bring it,
did you?

50:56.319 --> 50:57.251
Well, uh...

50:57.320 --> 50:59.151
You did.

50:59.222 --> 51:01.190
Look, can we
discuss this later?

51:01.258 --> 51:03.249
l should have mailed it
to the Marx Brothers.

51:03.326 --> 51:05.260
Will you take it easy?

51:05.328 --> 51:06.625
Take it easy?!

51:06.696 --> 51:07.685
Why do you think
l sent it home

51:07.764 --> 51:08.696
in the first place?

51:08.765 --> 51:10.198
So it wouldn't fall
into their hands!

51:10.267 --> 51:12.360
l came here
to save you!

51:12.436 --> 51:13.368
Oh, yeah?

51:13.437 --> 51:16.133
And who's gonna come
to save you, Junior?

51:16.206 --> 51:17.264
l told you...

51:24.247 --> 51:26.681
...don't call me Junior!

51:28.385 --> 51:30.945
Look what you did!

51:32.923 --> 51:35.016
l can't believe what you did...

51:36.526 --> 51:39.461
Elsa? Elsa?

51:39.529 --> 51:42.123
That's far enough.
Put down the gun, Dr. Jones.

51:42.199 --> 51:43.461
Put down the gun,
or the fraulein dies.

51:43.533 --> 51:44.465
But she's one of them.

51:44.534 --> 51:45.831
lndy, please!

51:45.902 --> 51:46.834
She's a Nazi.

51:46.903 --> 51:47.835
What?!

51:47.904 --> 51:48.529
Trust me.

51:48.605 --> 51:50.300
-lndy, no!
-l will kill her!

51:50.373 --> 51:51.704
Yeah? Go ahead!

51:51.775 --> 51:52.969
No! Don't shoot!

51:53.043 --> 51:55.204
Don't worry. He won't.

51:55.278 --> 51:57.303
lndy, please! Do what he says!

51:57.380 --> 51:59.871
And don't listen to her.

51:59.950 --> 52:01.815
Enough! She dies!

52:01.885 --> 52:05.252
Wait! Wait...

52:10.594 --> 52:12.528
l'm sorry.

52:12.596 --> 52:16.657
No, don't be.

52:28.345 --> 52:32.042
But... you should have
listened to your father.

52:49.332 --> 52:51.232
She ransacked her own room,

52:51.301 --> 52:53.098
and l fell for it.

52:53.170 --> 52:56.367
How did you know
she was a Nazi?

52:56.439 --> 52:57.371
Hmm?

52:57.440 --> 53:00.432
How did you know
she was a Nazi?

53:00.510 --> 53:03.138
She talks in her sleep.

53:12.622 --> 53:15.386
l didn't trust her.
Why did you?

53:15.458 --> 53:18.052
Because he didn't
take my advice.

53:24.367 --> 53:26.801
Donovan.

53:26.870 --> 53:28.167
Didn't l warn you

53:28.238 --> 53:30.672
not to trust anybody,
Dr. Jones?

53:30.740 --> 53:32.674
l misjudged you, Walter.

53:32.742 --> 53:36.200
l knew you would sell your
mother for an Etruscan vase,

53:36.279 --> 53:38.270
but l didn't know
you would sell

53:38.348 --> 53:39.940
your country
and your soul

53:40.016 --> 53:41.950
to the slime
of humanity.

53:42.052 --> 53:45.613
Dr. Schneider...

53:45.689 --> 53:47.884
there are pages
torn out of this.

53:56.266 --> 53:59.235
This book contained a map,
a map with no names,

53:59.302 --> 54:01.827
precise directions
from the unknown city

54:01.905 --> 54:04.567
to the secret Canyon
of the Crescent Moon.

54:04.641 --> 54:05.903
So it did.

54:05.976 --> 54:07.841
Where are these missing pages,
this map?

54:07.911 --> 54:09.845
We must have
these pages back.

54:09.913 --> 54:11.175
You're wasting
your breath.

54:11.248 --> 54:12.442
He won't tell us,

54:12.515 --> 54:14.813
and he doesn't have to.

54:14.884 --> 54:18.820
lt's perfectly obvious
where the pages are.

54:18.888 --> 54:20.913
He's given them
to Marcus Brody.

54:21.024 --> 54:21.922
Marcus?

54:22.058 --> 54:24.356
You didn't drag poor
Marcus along, did you?

54:24.427 --> 54:25.917
He's not up
to the challenge.

54:26.029 --> 54:27.929
He sticks out
like a sore thumb.

54:28.064 --> 54:29.292
We'll find him.

54:29.366 --> 54:30.526
The hell you will.

54:30.600 --> 54:32.295
He's got a two-day
head start on you,

54:32.369 --> 54:33.666
which is more
than he needs.

54:33.737 --> 54:36.069
Brody's got friends
in every town and village

54:36.139 --> 54:37.367
from here to the Sudan.

54:37.440 --> 54:40.307
He speaks a dozen languages,
knows every local custom.

54:40.377 --> 54:41.867
He'll blend in, disappear.

54:41.945 --> 54:43.503
You'll never see him again.

54:43.580 --> 54:47.482
With any luck,
he's got the Grail already.

54:47.617 --> 54:49.642
Does anyone here
speak English?

54:49.719 --> 54:50.708
Or even ancient Greek?

54:50.787 --> 54:52.220
Uh, water?
No, thank you, sir.

54:52.289 --> 54:53.654
No. Fish make love in it.

54:53.723 --> 54:54.917
Goodness me.

54:54.991 --> 54:55.923
Thank you so much.

54:55.992 --> 54:56.959
No, l don't like that.

54:57.060 --> 54:58.118
No, l really don't want...

54:58.194 --> 54:59.786
No, no, thank you very much.

54:59.863 --> 55:02.559
No, thank you, madam.
l'm a vegetarian.

55:02.632 --> 55:05.897
Does anyone understand
a word l'm saying here?

55:05.969 --> 55:07.129
Mr. Brody!

55:07.203 --> 55:08.727
Oh, Sallah.
What a relief.

55:08.805 --> 55:10.898
Marcus Brody, sir.

55:11.041 --> 55:12.008
But where is lndy?

55:12.075 --> 55:13.042
Oh, he's in Austria.

55:13.109 --> 55:14.076
A slight detour.

55:14.144 --> 55:15.475
You are on your own?

55:15.545 --> 55:16.671
Yes, but don't panic.

55:16.746 --> 55:18.270
Everything's under control.

55:18.348 --> 55:20.441
Have you, have you
arranged our supplies?

55:20.517 --> 55:21.449
Oh, yes,
of course.

55:21.518 --> 55:22.644
But where
are we going?

55:22.719 --> 55:23.913
Oh, this map will show you.

55:24.054 --> 55:25.817
lt was drawn by, uh...

55:25.889 --> 55:27.857
Mr. Brody.

55:27.924 --> 55:29.915
Welcome to lskenderun.

55:29.993 --> 55:31.927
The director
of the Museum of Antiquities

55:32.062 --> 55:33.222
has sent a car for you.

55:33.296 --> 55:35.560
Oh, well...
your servant, sir.

55:35.632 --> 55:36.929
And l am his.

55:37.033 --> 55:39.058
Follow me, please.

55:39.135 --> 55:41.126
My reputation precedes me.

55:41.204 --> 55:42.933
There is no museum
in lskenderun.

55:43.073 --> 55:44.540
Papers, please.

55:44.607 --> 55:45.574
Papers?

55:45.642 --> 55:46.666
Of course.

55:46.743 --> 55:47.801
Run.

55:47.877 --> 55:48.809
Yes.

55:48.878 --> 55:50.311
Papers. Got it here.

55:50.380 --> 55:51.938
Just finished
reading it myself.

55:52.082 --> 55:53.049
Run.

55:53.116 --> 55:54.048
Yes.

55:54.117 --> 55:55.778
''Egyptian Mail,''
morning edition.

55:55.852 --> 55:56.819
Run.

55:56.886 --> 55:57.818
Did you say, uh...

55:57.887 --> 55:58.512
Run!

56:14.270 --> 56:15.828
Okay, okay,
quick, quick, quick!

56:15.905 --> 56:17.736
Find the back door!
Find the back door!

56:32.489 --> 56:33.854
lntolerable.

56:36.893 --> 56:38.724
Dr. Schneider.
Message from Berlin.

56:38.795 --> 56:40.353
You must return immediately.

56:40.430 --> 56:42.489
A rally at the lnstitute
of Aryan Culture.

56:42.565 --> 56:43.554
So?

56:43.633 --> 56:44.895
Your presence
on the platform

56:44.968 --> 56:47.300
is requested
at the highest level.

56:47.370 --> 56:48.928
Thank you, Herr Oberst.

56:49.072 --> 56:50.562
l will meet you
at lskenderun.

56:50.640 --> 56:51.572
Take this diary

56:51.641 --> 56:52.835
to the Reichmuseum
in Berlin.

56:52.909 --> 56:54.206
lt will show them
our progress,

56:54.277 --> 56:55.209
ahead of schedule.

56:55.278 --> 56:56.245
Without the map,

56:56.312 --> 56:57.870
l'm afraid it's no
better than a souvenir.

56:57.947 --> 56:59.107
Let me kill them now.

56:59.182 --> 57:00.149
No.

57:00.216 --> 57:02.480
lf we fail to recover
the pages from Brody,

57:02.552 --> 57:03.746
we'll need them alive.

57:03.820 --> 57:06.186
Always do what
the doctor orders.

57:14.330 --> 57:15.854
Don't look at me like that.

57:15.932 --> 57:18.025
We both wanted the Grail.

57:18.101 --> 57:21.093
l would have done
anything to get it.

57:21.171 --> 57:22.399
You would have
done the same.

57:22.472 --> 57:24.963
l'm sorry you think so.

57:35.318 --> 57:38.651
l can't forget
how wonderful it was.

57:38.721 --> 57:40.188
Thank you.

57:40.256 --> 57:42.281
lt was rather wonderful.

57:51.501 --> 57:53.594
Oh, Dr. Schneider.

57:55.138 --> 57:56.662
Your car is waiting.

58:04.514 --> 58:06.914
That's how Austrians
say good-bye.

58:12.956 --> 58:16.790
And this is how we say good-bye
in Germany, Dr. Jones.

58:18.328 --> 58:19.795
Oh!

58:25.068 --> 58:27.059
l liked the Austrian way
better.

58:27.136 --> 58:28.763
So did l.

58:28.838 --> 58:30.703
Let's try and get
these ropes loose.

58:30.773 --> 58:33.298
We've got to get to Marcus
before the Nazis do.

58:33.376 --> 58:35.537
You said he had
two days' start.

58:35.612 --> 58:37.477
That he would blend in.
Disappear.

58:37.547 --> 58:39.242
Are you kidding?
l made that up.

58:39.315 --> 58:40.247
You know Marcus.

58:40.316 --> 58:41.874
He got lost once
in his own museum.

58:41.951 --> 58:43.077
Oh...

58:43.152 --> 58:47.111
Can you try and reach
my left jacket pocket?

58:48.625 --> 58:49.922
What am l looking for?

58:49.993 --> 58:51.517
My lucky charm.

58:53.062 --> 58:54.654
Feels like
a cigarette lighter.

58:55.865 --> 58:57.526
Try and burn
through the ropes.

58:57.600 --> 59:00.569
Very good.

59:04.941 --> 59:05.999
Oh!

59:25.261 --> 59:26.489
l ought to tell you something.

59:26.563 --> 59:27.825
Don't get
sentimental now Dad.

59:27.897 --> 59:29.296
Save it till
we get out of here.

59:29.365 --> 59:31.094
The floor's on fire.

59:31.167 --> 59:32.828
-See?
-What?

59:32.902 --> 59:34.563
And the chair.

59:34.637 --> 59:36.002
Move! Move it out of here!

59:36.072 --> 59:37.096
Go!

59:37.173 --> 59:39.073
lt's scorching the table!
Fast!

59:39.142 --> 59:40.109
-Move!
-Okay!

59:54.023 --> 59:56.082
Well, we have Marcus Brody,

59:56.159 --> 59:59.094
but more important,
we have the map.

01:00:03.499 --> 01:00:05.296
''By the personal command
of the Fuhrer.

01:00:05.368 --> 01:00:06.926
''Secrecy essential to success.

01:00:07.003 --> 01:00:09.699
Eliminate the American
conspirators.''

01:00:09.772 --> 01:00:13.572
Germany has declared war
on the Jones boys.

01:00:19.248 --> 01:00:20.180
-Dad!
-What?

01:00:20.249 --> 01:00:21.181
Dad!

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:22.182
What?

01:00:22.251 --> 01:00:23.183
-Dad!
-What?

01:00:23.252 --> 01:00:24.446
Head for the fireplace!

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:25.509
Oh.

01:00:37.533 --> 01:00:39.592
l think l can get
these ropes off.

01:00:40.803 --> 01:00:41.792
Whoops.

01:00:52.515 --> 01:00:55.643
Our situation has not improved.

01:00:55.718 --> 01:00:57.618
Listen, Dad, l'm almost free.

01:01:12.769 --> 01:01:14.100
Alarm!

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:24.806
This is intolerable.

01:01:26.049 --> 01:01:27.346
l'm out, Dad.

01:01:27.417 --> 01:01:29.442
Well done, boy.

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:06.453
Come on, Dad.

01:02:12.795 --> 01:02:14.422
Dead end.

01:02:14.497 --> 01:02:16.055
There's got to be a...

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:17.929
a secret door or a...

01:02:18.067 --> 01:02:20.501
passageway
or something.

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:23.835
l find that if l just
sit down and think...

01:02:26.476 --> 01:02:28.068
Dad!

01:02:31.981 --> 01:02:34.279
...the solution presents itself.

01:02:42.191 --> 01:02:44.455
Great. More boats.

01:02:47.497 --> 01:02:48.759
You say this has been

01:02:48.831 --> 01:02:51.231
just another typical
day for you, huh?

01:02:52.969 --> 01:02:56.097
No! But better than most.

01:02:58.474 --> 01:03:00.408
Come on, Dad. Come on.

01:03:00.476 --> 01:03:01.807
What about the boat?

01:03:01.878 --> 01:03:03.903
We're not going on the boat?

01:03:19.061 --> 01:03:20.050
Jones!

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:33.866
Halt! Halt!

01:05:36.699 --> 01:05:38.030
-Stop!
-What?

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:39.829
Stop! Stop!

01:05:39.902 --> 01:05:41.699
You're going the wrong way.

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:43.466
We have to get to Berlin.

01:05:43.539 --> 01:05:45.564
Brody's this way.

01:05:45.641 --> 01:05:47.438
My diary's in Berlin.

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:49.774
We don't
need the diary, Dad.

01:05:49.845 --> 01:05:51.403
Marcus has the map.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:54.643
There is more in the diary
than just the map.

01:05:55.818 --> 01:05:57.982
All right, Dad. Tell me.

01:05:57.982 --> 01:06:03.716
Well, he who finds the Grail
must face the final challenge.

01:06:03.787 --> 01:06:05.220
What final challenge?

01:06:05.289 --> 01:06:08.452
Three devices
of such lethal cunning.

01:06:08.525 --> 01:06:09.685
Booby traps?

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:11.057
Oh, yes.

01:06:11.128 --> 01:06:14.529
But l found the clues that
will safely take us through,

01:06:14.598 --> 01:06:16.828
in the Chronicles
of St. Anselm.

01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:19.300
Well, what are they?

01:06:22.873 --> 01:06:24.238
Can't you remember?

01:06:25.943 --> 01:06:27.467
l wrote them down in my diary

01:06:27.544 --> 01:06:30.069
so that l wouldn't have
to remember.

01:06:30.147 --> 01:06:31.876
Half the German army's
on our tail,

01:06:31.949 --> 01:06:33.644
and you want me to go
to Berlin?

01:06:33.717 --> 01:06:34.741
lnto the lion's den?

01:06:34.818 --> 01:06:35.807
Yes.

01:06:35.886 --> 01:06:37.786
The only thing that matters
is the Grail.

01:06:37.855 --> 01:06:39.220
What about Marcus?

01:06:39.289 --> 01:06:41.280
Marcus would agree with me.

01:06:41.358 --> 01:06:43.826
Two selfless martyrs.

01:06:43.894 --> 01:06:45.794
Jesus Christ.

01:06:48.966 --> 01:06:50.524
That's for blasphemy.

01:06:53.704 --> 01:06:59.199
The quest for the Grail
is not archaeology.

01:06:59.276 --> 01:07:01.836
lt's a race against evil.

01:07:01.912 --> 01:07:05.643
lf it is captured by the Nazis,
the armies of darkness

01:07:05.716 --> 01:07:08.184
will march all over
the face of the Earth.

01:07:08.252 --> 01:07:09.651
Do you understand me?

01:07:11.622 --> 01:07:13.487
This is an obsession, Dad.

01:07:13.557 --> 01:07:15.616
l never understood it.

01:07:15.692 --> 01:07:17.091
Never.

01:07:18.896 --> 01:07:20.488
Neither did Mom.

01:07:20.564 --> 01:07:22.555
Oh, yes, she did.

01:07:22.633 --> 01:07:24.601
Only too well.

01:07:24.668 --> 01:07:30.072
Unfortunately, she kept
her illness from me

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:32.768
until all l could do
was mourn her.

01:08:35.404 --> 01:08:39.000
My boy, we are pilgrims
in an unholy land.

01:09:08.471 --> 01:09:10.462
Fraulein Doctor.

01:09:10.541 --> 01:09:11.667
Where is it?

01:09:11.742 --> 01:09:12.834
How did you get here?

01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:14.069
Where is it?

01:09:14.144 --> 01:09:16.510
l want it.

01:09:17.915 --> 01:09:20.850
You came back for the book? Why?

01:09:20.984 --> 01:09:22.849
My father didn't want
it incinerated.

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:25.444
ls that
what you think of me?

01:09:25.522 --> 01:09:27.319
l believe in the Grail,
not the swastika.

01:09:27.390 --> 01:09:28.721
But you stood up to be counted

01:09:28.792 --> 01:09:31.283
with the enemy of everything
that the Grail stands for.

01:09:31.361 --> 01:09:33.295
Who gives a damn what you think?

01:09:33.363 --> 01:09:34.853
You do.

01:09:34.932 --> 01:09:38.662
All l have to
do is squeeze.

01:09:38.734 --> 01:09:40.999
All l have to do is scream.

01:09:50.214 --> 01:09:51.305
l've got it.

01:09:51.381 --> 01:09:53.349
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:11:05.489 --> 01:11:06.581
What did you get?

01:11:06.657 --> 01:11:07.783
l don't know.

01:11:07.858 --> 01:11:09.792
First available flight
out of Germany.

01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:11.919
Good.

01:11:36.186 --> 01:11:39.451
Well, we made it.

01:11:39.523 --> 01:11:42.856
When we're airborne,
with Germany behind us,

01:11:42.926 --> 01:11:45.793
then l'll share
that sentiment.

01:11:45.862 --> 01:11:47.955
Relax.

01:12:32.642 --> 01:12:34.940
Tickets, please.

01:12:46.490 --> 01:12:48.151
Guten Tag...

01:12:48.225 --> 01:12:49.954
Herr Jones.

01:12:53.530 --> 01:12:54.792
Tickets, please.

01:13:07.377 --> 01:13:09.345
Oh, we should
get out of here.

01:13:10.881 --> 01:13:12.644
No ticket.

01:13:15.352 --> 01:13:16.046
Ticket.

01:13:16.119 --> 01:13:17.518
-Ticket!
-Ticket!

01:13:17.587 --> 01:13:18.986
-Ticket! -Ticket!

01:13:36.273 --> 01:13:37.604
You know,

01:13:37.674 --> 01:13:42.077
sharing your adventures is
an interesting experience.

01:13:42.145 --> 01:13:44.409
That's not all we shared.

01:13:44.481 --> 01:13:45.914
lt's disgraceful.

01:13:45.982 --> 01:13:47.677
You're old enough
to be her fa...

01:13:47.751 --> 01:13:49.013
her-her grandfather.

01:13:49.085 --> 01:13:51.053
Well, l'm as human
as the next man.

01:13:51.121 --> 01:13:53.089
l was the next man.

01:13:53.156 --> 01:13:54.282
Oh.

01:13:55.492 --> 01:13:57.084
Of course. Well...

01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:59.651
Ships that pass
in the night.

01:13:59.729 --> 01:14:03.165
Do you remember the last time
we had a quiet drink, hmm?

01:14:05.202 --> 01:14:06.533
l had a milkshake.

01:14:06.603 --> 01:14:08.537
Hmm?

01:14:08.605 --> 01:14:10.800
What did we
talk about?

01:14:10.874 --> 01:14:12.865
We didn't talk.

01:14:12.976 --> 01:14:15.342
We never talked.

01:14:15.412 --> 01:14:20.247
Do l detect
a rebuke?

01:14:20.317 --> 01:14:22.285
A regret.

01:14:22.352 --> 01:14:23.842
lt was just the two of us, Dad.

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:25.478
lt was a lonely way to grow up.

01:14:25.555 --> 01:14:26.681
For you, too.

01:14:26.756 --> 01:14:28.519
lf you'd been an ordinary,
average father,

01:14:28.592 --> 01:14:30.856
like the other guys' dads,
you'd have understood that.

01:14:30.927 --> 01:14:34.021
Actually, l was
a wonderful father.

01:14:34.097 --> 01:14:36.065
When?

01:14:36.132 --> 01:14:37.997
Did l ever tell
you to eat up?

01:14:38.068 --> 01:14:39.660
Go to bed?
Wash your ears?

01:14:39.736 --> 01:14:41.260
Do your homework? No.

01:14:41.338 --> 01:14:43.135
l respected
your privacy,

01:14:43.206 --> 01:14:45.470
and l taught
you self-reliance.

01:14:45.542 --> 01:14:46.566
What you taught me was

01:14:46.643 --> 01:14:48.110
that l was
less important to you

01:14:48.178 --> 01:14:49.577
than people
who'd been dead

01:14:49.646 --> 01:14:51.204
for 500 years
in another country.

01:14:51.281 --> 01:14:53.044
And l learned it so well

01:14:53.116 --> 01:14:55.914
that we've hardly spoken
for 20 years.

01:14:55.986 --> 01:14:58.250
You left just when you
were becoming interesting.

01:14:58.321 --> 01:14:59.788
Unbelievable.

01:14:59.856 --> 01:15:00.914
Dad, how can you...?

01:15:01.024 --> 01:15:02.048
Very well.

01:15:02.125 --> 01:15:04.559
l'm here now.

01:15:04.628 --> 01:15:06.653
What do you want
to talk about?

01:15:06.730 --> 01:15:07.856
Hmm?

01:15:07.998 --> 01:15:10.398
Well, l...

01:15:12.369 --> 01:15:14.064
Uh...

01:15:17.841 --> 01:15:20.105
l can't think of anything.

01:15:20.176 --> 01:15:22.235
Then what are
you complaining about?

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:25.848
Look, we have work to do.

01:15:27.517 --> 01:15:29.451
When we get to
Alexandretta,

01:15:29.519 --> 01:15:31.817
we will face
three challenges.

01:15:31.888 --> 01:15:33.822
The first,

01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:35.414
''The Breath of God.

01:15:35.492 --> 01:15:37.756
Only the penitent
man will pass.''

01:15:37.827 --> 01:15:39.089
Second,

01:15:39.162 --> 01:15:40.424
''The Word of God.

01:15:40.497 --> 01:15:44.058
Only in the footsteps
of God will he proceed.''

01:15:44.134 --> 01:15:45.226
Third,

01:15:45.302 --> 01:15:46.792
''The Path of God.

01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:48.895
''Only in the leap
from the lion's head

01:15:48.972 --> 01:15:51.532
will he prove his worth.''

01:15:53.643 --> 01:15:55.668
What does that mean?

01:15:55.745 --> 01:15:57.679
l don't know.

01:15:57.747 --> 01:15:59.180
We'll find out.

01:16:05.689 --> 01:16:08.715
We're turning around.

01:16:08.792 --> 01:16:11.226
They're taking us back
to Germany.

01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:19.564
Well, l thought
it would take them a lot longer

01:16:19.636 --> 01:16:20.967
to figure out
the radio was dead.

01:16:21.037 --> 01:16:23.005
Come on, Dad. Move!

01:16:26.710 --> 01:16:29.008
Come on, Dad. Come on!

01:16:42.959 --> 01:16:45.086
l didn't know you
could fly a plane.

01:16:45.161 --> 01:16:46.321
Fly, yes.

01:16:48.565 --> 01:16:50.863
Land, no.

01:17:14.391 --> 01:17:16.552
Dad, you're going to have
to use the machine gun.

01:17:16.626 --> 01:17:18.821
Get it ready.

01:17:18.895 --> 01:17:21.295
Eleven o'clock!

01:17:21.364 --> 01:17:23.628
Dad, eleven o'clock!

01:17:24.701 --> 01:17:27.169
What happens at eleven o'clock?

01:17:27.237 --> 01:17:29.205
Twelve, eleven, ten.

01:17:29.272 --> 01:17:31.240
Eleven o'clock, fire!

01:17:57.734 --> 01:17:59.793
Dad, are we hit?!

01:17:59.869 --> 01:18:01.894
More or less.

01:18:01.971 --> 01:18:03.836
Son, l'm sorry.

01:18:03.973 --> 01:18:06.066
They got us.

01:18:08.044 --> 01:18:09.033
Hang on, Dad.

01:18:09.112 --> 01:18:10.374
We're going in!

01:18:23.059 --> 01:18:24.185
Nice landing.

01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:26.285
Thanks.

01:18:40.710 --> 01:18:42.200
Those people are
trying to kill us!

01:18:42.278 --> 01:18:43.370
l know, Dad!

01:18:43.446 --> 01:18:44.811
Well.

01:18:44.881 --> 01:18:46.872
lt's a new
experience for me.

01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:49.510
lt happens to me all the time.

01:19:19.983 --> 01:19:21.951
This is intolerable!

01:19:23.319 --> 01:19:24.684
This could be close.

01:19:32.996 --> 01:19:35.556
Faster, boy! Faster!

01:19:51.214 --> 01:19:53.580
Well, they don't come
any closer than that!

01:20:09.399 --> 01:20:12.232
Dad, he's coming back!

01:20:58.781 --> 01:21:01.341
l suddenly
remembered my Charlemagne.

01:21:01.417 --> 01:21:04.318
''Let my armies be the rocks
and the trees

01:21:04.387 --> 01:21:06.548
and the birds in the sky.''

01:21:24.073 --> 01:21:25.267
These pages are taken

01:21:25.341 --> 01:21:27.832
from Professor Jones'
diary, Your Highness,

01:21:27.911 --> 01:21:29.208
and they include a map

01:21:29.279 --> 01:21:32.043
that pinpoints the exact
location of the Grail.

01:21:32.115 --> 01:21:34.709
As you can see, the Grail
is all but in our hands.

01:21:34.784 --> 01:21:35.910
However, Your Highness,

01:21:36.019 --> 01:21:38.078
we would not think
of crossing your soil

01:21:38.154 --> 01:21:39.416
without your permission,

01:21:39.489 --> 01:21:41.719
nor of removing the
Grail from your borders

01:21:41.791 --> 01:21:44.760
without suitable
compensation.

01:21:46.996 --> 01:21:49.123
What have you brought?

01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:59.640
Precious valuables,
Your Highness,

01:21:59.709 --> 01:22:02.644
donated by some
of the finest families

01:22:02.712 --> 01:22:04.771
in all of Germany.

01:22:07.951 --> 01:22:09.282
Ah!

01:22:09.352 --> 01:22:12.321
Rolls-Royce
Phantom Two.

01:22:12.388 --> 01:22:13.878
Four-point-three liter,

01:22:13.957 --> 01:22:16.482
30 horsepower,
six-cylinder engine,

01:22:16.559 --> 01:22:19.221
with Stromberg
downdraft carburetor.

01:22:19.295 --> 01:22:22.822
Can go from zero to
1 00 kilometers an hour

01:22:22.899 --> 01:22:25.231
in 1 2.5 seconds.

01:22:25.301 --> 01:22:27.462
And l even
like the color.

01:22:27.537 --> 01:22:30.938
The keys are in the ignition,
Your Highness.

01:22:32.241 --> 01:22:34.732
You shall have
camels, horses,

01:22:34.811 --> 01:22:36.745
an armed escort, provisions,

01:22:36.813 --> 01:22:38.747
desert vehicles

01:22:38.815 --> 01:22:40.009
and tanks.

01:22:40.083 --> 01:22:42.051
You're welcome.

01:22:57.633 --> 01:22:59.066
We have no time to lose.

01:22:59.135 --> 01:23:01.763
lndiana Jones
and his father have escaped.

01:23:04.507 --> 01:23:06.407
We go this way.

01:23:06.476 --> 01:23:08.034
Get that camel
out of the way.

01:23:10.513 --> 01:23:12.242
What happened
to Marcus, Sallah?

01:23:12.315 --> 01:23:15.182
Ah, they set out across
the desert this afternoon.

01:23:15.251 --> 01:23:18.084
l believe they took
Mr. Brody with them.

01:23:19.522 --> 01:23:22.286
Now they have the map.

01:23:22.358 --> 01:23:24.986
And in this sort of race,

01:23:25.061 --> 01:23:28.326
there's no silver medal
for finishing second.

01:23:50.153 --> 01:23:52.883
Care to wet your
whistle, Marcus?

01:23:52.955 --> 01:23:54.923
l'd rather spit
in your face.

01:23:55.058 --> 01:23:57.151
But as l haven't
got any spit...

01:23:59.829 --> 01:24:02.127
Must be within
three or four miles.

01:24:02.198 --> 01:24:04.928
Otherwise we are
off the map.

01:24:06.702 --> 01:24:09.432
Well, Marcus,
we are on the brink

01:24:09.505 --> 01:24:11.632
of the recovery
of the greatest artifact

01:24:11.707 --> 01:24:13.106
in the history
of mankind.

01:24:13.176 --> 01:24:15.667
You're meddling with powers

01:24:15.745 --> 01:24:18.612
you cannot
possibly comprehend.

01:24:23.953 --> 01:24:26.581
Ah, l see Brody.

01:24:26.656 --> 01:24:29.124
He seems okay.

01:24:32.028 --> 01:24:33.620
They've got a tank.

01:24:39.635 --> 01:24:41.227
Six-pound gun.

01:24:41.304 --> 01:24:43.033
What do you think
you're doing there?

01:24:43.106 --> 01:24:44.038
Get down!

01:24:44.107 --> 01:24:46.701
Dad, we're well out of range.

01:24:56.819 --> 01:24:58.753
That car belonged
to my brother-in-law.

01:24:58.821 --> 01:25:00.083
Come on, come on!

01:25:00.156 --> 01:25:02.056
l can't see anyone up there.

01:25:02.125 --> 01:25:03.854
Maybe it wasn't
even Jones.

01:25:03.926 --> 01:25:05.484
No, it is him,
all right.

01:25:05.561 --> 01:25:07.256
He's here somewhere.

01:25:07.330 --> 01:25:10.060
Put Brody in the tank.

01:25:17.773 --> 01:25:20.333
Well, in this sun,

01:25:20.409 --> 01:25:22.707
without transportation,
they're as good as dead.

01:25:32.355 --> 01:25:34.016
lt's Jones, all right.

01:25:38.194 --> 01:25:39.684
Now, who are
all these people?

01:25:39.762 --> 01:25:40.694
Who cares?

01:25:40.763 --> 01:25:42.697
As long as they're
keeping Donovan busy.

01:25:42.765 --> 01:25:44.562
Dad, you stay here
while Sallah and l

01:25:44.634 --> 01:25:46.693
organize some transportation.

01:26:11.227 --> 01:26:12.854
l'm going after those horses.

01:26:12.929 --> 01:26:13.861
l'll take the camels.

01:26:13.996 --> 01:26:14.963
l don't need camels.

01:26:15.031 --> 01:26:15.963
But, lndy...

01:26:16.032 --> 01:26:17.124
No camels.

01:26:28.010 --> 01:26:29.477
Who is he?

01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:34.215
A messenger from God.

01:26:34.283 --> 01:26:36.649
For the unrighteous,

01:26:36.719 --> 01:26:41.088
the Cup of Life
holds everlasting damnation.

01:26:59.508 --> 01:27:00.475
Marcus!

01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:02.568
Oh.

01:27:02.645 --> 01:27:05.773
''Genius of the Restoration...''

01:27:05.848 --> 01:27:08.840
''Aid our own resuscitation.''

01:27:08.918 --> 01:27:10.180
Henry, what are you
doing here?

01:27:10.253 --> 01:27:11.618
lt's a rescue, old boy.
Come on.

01:27:18.027 --> 01:27:19.221
Search him.

01:27:19.295 --> 01:27:21.525
What is in this book?

01:27:21.597 --> 01:27:25.158
That miserable
little diary of yours.

01:27:25.234 --> 01:27:27.395
We have the map.
The book is useless.

01:27:27.470 --> 01:27:30.735
And yet you come all the way
back to Berlin to get it.

01:27:30.806 --> 01:27:31.864
Why?

01:27:31.941 --> 01:27:34.842
What are you hiding?

01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:36.571
What does the diary
tell you

01:27:36.646 --> 01:27:39.376
that it doesn't
tell us?

01:27:39.448 --> 01:27:42.884
lt tells me that goose-stepping
morons like yourself

01:27:43.019 --> 01:27:46.819
should try reading books
instead of burning them.

01:27:46.889 --> 01:27:48.379
Colonel!

01:27:48.457 --> 01:27:49.856
Jones is getting away.

01:27:49.925 --> 01:27:51.654
l think not,

01:27:51.727 --> 01:27:53.024
Herr Donovan.

01:27:53.095 --> 01:27:55.529
Not that Jones,
the other Jones!

01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:07.502
Sallah, l said no camels!

01:28:07.576 --> 01:28:08.702
That's five camels.

01:28:08.778 --> 01:28:09.767
Can't you count?

01:28:09.845 --> 01:28:12.075
Compensation for
my brother-in-law's car.

01:28:12.148 --> 01:28:14.343
lndy, your father
and Brody...

01:28:14.417 --> 01:28:15.816
Where's my father?

01:28:15.885 --> 01:28:17.045
They have them.

01:28:17.119 --> 01:28:19.417
ln the belly
of that steel beast.

01:28:21.791 --> 01:28:23.520
Hyah!

01:28:31.067 --> 01:28:32.557
Hyah, hyah, hyah!

01:28:32.635 --> 01:28:34.227
Hey-ah, hey-ah, hey-ah!

01:28:42.478 --> 01:28:43.604
Fire!

01:30:44.233 --> 01:30:46.929
Dad! Dad!

01:30:47.002 --> 01:30:47.866
Dad!

01:30:47.937 --> 01:30:49.234
Junior?

01:30:49.305 --> 01:30:50.772
Junior?!

01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:52.068
Junior!

01:32:06.749 --> 01:32:08.239
Dad!

01:32:10.052 --> 01:32:11.110
Dad!

01:32:11.186 --> 01:32:12.915
Dad! Get out!

01:33:32.968 --> 01:33:34.697
Henry, the pen...

01:33:34.770 --> 01:33:36.397
-What?
-But don't you see?

01:33:36.472 --> 01:33:39.703
The pen is mightier
than the sword.

01:34:02.031 --> 01:34:03.589
Look what you did.

01:34:03.666 --> 01:34:05.258
lt's war.

01:34:10.973 --> 01:34:12.702
Didn't l tell you
it was a rescue, huh?

01:35:17.039 --> 01:35:18.301
Dad!

01:35:18.373 --> 01:35:20.170
Yeah?

01:35:20.242 --> 01:35:22.073
You call this archaeology?

01:35:22.144 --> 01:35:23.372
Get out of there, Dad.

01:35:34.389 --> 01:35:36.448
How does one
get off this thing?

01:35:43.398 --> 01:35:44.456
Where's Marcus?

01:35:48.303 --> 01:35:49.702
Dad!

01:35:54.143 --> 01:35:55.303
Hang on, Dad!

01:36:01.750 --> 01:36:04.241
Father of lndy,
give me your hand!

01:36:04.319 --> 01:36:06.082
Sallah!

01:36:06.155 --> 01:36:07.520
Get Dad!

01:36:07.589 --> 01:36:09.489
Give me your hand!

01:36:58.040 --> 01:36:59.769
Junior!

01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:03.241
lndy!

01:37:12.454 --> 01:37:14.684
Oh, God.

01:37:14.756 --> 01:37:16.849
l've lost him.

01:37:19.895 --> 01:37:24.696
And l never told him anything.

01:37:24.766 --> 01:37:28.862
l just wasn't ready, Marcus.

01:37:29.004 --> 01:37:32.940
Five minutes
would have been enough.

01:38:08.610 --> 01:38:11.636
l thought
l'd lost you, boy!

01:38:11.713 --> 01:38:15.479
l thought
you had too, sir.

01:38:15.550 --> 01:38:18.178
Mmm...

01:38:28.063 --> 01:38:31.863
Well...

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.867
Well done. Come on.

01:38:37.472 --> 01:38:39.838
Let's go, then.

01:38:41.310 --> 01:38:43.301
Why are you
sitting there resting

01:38:43.378 --> 01:38:45.175
when we're so near the end?!

01:38:45.247 --> 01:38:47.511
Come on, let's go!

01:38:59.461 --> 01:39:03.693
The Canyon
of the Crescent Moon.

01:41:30.812 --> 01:41:32.473
Helmut, another volunteer!

01:42:01.109 --> 01:42:03.634
l never expected
to see you again.

01:42:03.712 --> 01:42:06.647
l'm like a bad penny;
l always turn up.

01:42:06.715 --> 01:42:08.842
Step back now,
Dr. Schneider.

01:42:08.917 --> 01:42:10.748
Give Dr. Jones some room.

01:42:10.819 --> 01:42:13.811
He's going to recover
the Grail for us.

01:42:15.857 --> 01:42:18.417
lmpossible?
What do you say, Jones?

01:42:18.493 --> 01:42:20.620
Ready to go down in history?

01:42:20.695 --> 01:42:21.889
As what?

01:42:21.963 --> 01:42:23.624
A Nazi stooge like you?

01:42:23.698 --> 01:42:25.461
The Nazis?!

01:42:25.534 --> 01:42:28.469
ls that the limit
of your vision?

01:42:28.537 --> 01:42:30.368
The Nazis want
to write themselves

01:42:30.438 --> 01:42:31.803
into the Grail legend...

01:42:31.873 --> 01:42:33.500
take on the world.

01:42:33.575 --> 01:42:36.874
Well, they're welcome.

01:42:36.945 --> 01:42:39.470
But l want
the Grail itself.

01:42:39.548 --> 01:42:43.245
The cup that gives
everlasting life.

01:42:43.318 --> 01:42:44.649
Hitler can have
the world,

01:42:44.719 --> 01:42:46.277
but he can't
take it with him.

01:42:46.354 --> 01:42:49.016
l'm going to be
drinking my own health

01:42:49.090 --> 01:42:51.615
when he's gone the way
of the dodo.

01:42:55.096 --> 01:42:56.529
The Grail is mine...

01:42:56.598 --> 01:42:59.032
and you're going
to get it for me.

01:42:59.100 --> 01:43:01.591
Shooting me
won't get you anywhere.

01:43:01.670 --> 01:43:03.763
You know something,
Dr. Jones?

01:43:03.838 --> 01:43:05.635
You're absolutely right.

01:43:08.610 --> 01:43:10.578
Dad?

01:43:10.645 --> 01:43:11.873
Dad?!

01:43:12.013 --> 01:43:13.742
Junior...

01:43:13.815 --> 01:43:15.612
-No!
-Get back!

01:43:33.535 --> 01:43:35.628
You can't save him
when you're dead!

01:43:35.704 --> 01:43:37.069
The healing power
of the Grail

01:43:37.138 --> 01:43:39.402
is the only thing
that can save your father now.

01:43:39.474 --> 01:43:42.932
lt's time to ask yourself
what you believe.

01:44:16.978 --> 01:44:21.472
''The Breath of God...

01:44:21.549 --> 01:44:25.178
...only the penitent man
will pass.''

01:44:25.253 --> 01:44:28.188
''The penitent man will pass.

01:44:46.141 --> 01:44:48.905
The penitent man will pass.

01:44:49.010 --> 01:44:51.672
The penitent man...

01:44:54.115 --> 01:44:56.640
''Only the penitent man
will pass.''

01:44:56.718 --> 01:44:59.278
''Only the penitent
man will pass.''

01:44:59.354 --> 01:45:01.288
The penitent man will pass.

01:45:01.356 --> 01:45:03.221
The penitent, penitent...

01:45:03.291 --> 01:45:04.849
The penitent man...

01:45:04.959 --> 01:45:06.392
The penitent man...

01:45:06.461 --> 01:45:07.519
The penitent...

01:45:07.595 --> 01:45:10.621
The penitent man
is humble before God.

01:45:10.699 --> 01:45:12.462
Penitent. Penitent...

01:45:12.534 --> 01:45:14.365
The penitent man...

01:45:14.436 --> 01:45:17.599
Penitent man
is humble...

01:45:17.672 --> 01:45:19.196
...kneels before God.

01:45:19.274 --> 01:45:20.241
Kneel!

01:45:29.117 --> 01:45:30.482
l'm through!

01:45:30.552 --> 01:45:34.113
We're through.

01:45:36.091 --> 01:45:37.752
He's all right.

01:45:37.826 --> 01:45:39.384
No.

01:45:39.461 --> 01:45:42.453
The second challenge:
''The Word of God.''

01:45:42.530 --> 01:45:46.057
''Only in the footsteps
of God will he proceed.''

01:45:49.904 --> 01:45:52.498
The Word of God...

01:45:52.574 --> 01:45:53.939
The Word of...

01:45:57.145 --> 01:46:00.603
Proceed in the footsteps
of the Word.

01:46:00.682 --> 01:46:01.944
''The Word of God...''

01:46:02.016 --> 01:46:03.881
No, Henry.
Try not to talk.

01:46:10.492 --> 01:46:13.461
The name of God...

01:46:13.528 --> 01:46:18.522
The name of God...

01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:21.364
Jehovah.

01:46:21.436 --> 01:46:26.999
But in the Latin alphabet,
Jehovah begins with an ''l.''

01:46:27.075 --> 01:46:29.100
J...

01:46:34.916 --> 01:46:36.042
Oh, dear.

01:46:40.588 --> 01:46:41.850
ldiot!

01:46:41.923 --> 01:46:45.552
ln Latin, Jehovah
starts with an ''l.''

01:46:47.162 --> 01:46:49.357
''l''...

01:46:49.431 --> 01:46:51.797
''E''...

01:46:51.866 --> 01:46:53.390
''H''...

01:46:53.468 --> 01:46:54.662
''O''...

01:46:54.736 --> 01:46:55.668
Oh!

01:46:55.737 --> 01:46:58.137
''V''...

01:46:58.206 --> 01:46:59.730
''A''...

01:47:22.030 --> 01:47:23.998
''The Path of God.''

01:47:26.634 --> 01:47:29.660
''Only in the leap
from the lion's head

01:47:29.737 --> 01:47:33.673
will he prove his worth.''

01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:40.711
lmpossible...
nobody can jump this.

01:47:41.649 --> 01:47:43.583
lndy!

01:47:43.651 --> 01:47:45.676
lndy, you must hurry!

01:47:45.753 --> 01:47:47.243
Come quickly!

01:47:53.495 --> 01:47:55.895
lt's a leap of faith.

01:47:55.964 --> 01:47:57.454
Oh, geez...

01:47:57.532 --> 01:48:00.092
You must believe, boy.

01:48:00.168 --> 01:48:02.466
You must... believe.

01:49:40.435 --> 01:49:42.562
Oh.

01:49:48.910 --> 01:49:51.174
l knew you'd come,

01:49:51.245 --> 01:49:53.839
but my strength has left me.

01:49:53.915 --> 01:49:55.940
Who are you?

01:49:56.017 --> 01:49:58.417
The last of three brothers

01:49:58.486 --> 01:50:01.250
who swore an oath
to find the Grail

01:50:01.322 --> 01:50:03.483
and to guard it.

01:50:03.558 --> 01:50:06.288
That was 700 years ago.

01:50:06.361 --> 01:50:09.228
A long time to wait.

01:50:10.298 --> 01:50:12.493
You're strangely dressed...

01:50:12.567 --> 01:50:14.558
for a knight.

01:50:14.636 --> 01:50:17.230
l'm not exactly...

01:50:17.305 --> 01:50:18.397
a knight.

01:50:18.473 --> 01:50:19.770
What do you mean?

01:50:19.841 --> 01:50:22.036
l was chosen

01:50:22.110 --> 01:50:25.204
because l was the bravest,
the most worthy.

01:50:25.279 --> 01:50:27.213
The honor was mine

01:50:27.281 --> 01:50:29.841
until another came
to challenge me

01:50:29.917 --> 01:50:33.080
to single combat.

01:50:33.154 --> 01:50:35.122
l pass it...

01:50:35.189 --> 01:50:40.286
to you who vanquished me.

01:50:42.063 --> 01:50:44.122
Listen, l don't have
time to explain, but...

01:51:01.582 --> 01:51:03.777
Which one is it?

01:51:03.851 --> 01:51:05.842
You must choose,

01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:08.320
but choose wisely.

01:51:08.389 --> 01:51:11.187
For as the true Grail
will bring you life,

01:51:11.259 --> 01:51:13.250
the false Grail

01:51:13.327 --> 01:51:15.295
will take it from you.

01:51:19.767 --> 01:51:22.668
l'm not a historian.

01:51:22.737 --> 01:51:24.170
l have no idea

01:51:24.238 --> 01:51:26.001
what it looks like.

01:51:26.074 --> 01:51:27.564
Which one is it?

01:51:27.642 --> 01:51:29.633
Let me choose.

01:51:29.711 --> 01:51:32.145
Thank you, Doctor.

01:51:45.193 --> 01:51:47.354
Oh, yes.

01:51:51.966 --> 01:51:56.460
lt's more beautiful
than l'd ever imagined.

01:52:06.914 --> 01:52:10.748
This certainly is the cup
of the King of Kings.

01:52:17.125 --> 01:52:19.355
Eternal life.

01:52:53.661 --> 01:52:56.425
What is happening to me?

01:52:58.499 --> 01:52:59.830
Oh!

01:53:01.068 --> 01:53:03.434
Tell me, what is happening?

01:53:26.527 --> 01:53:28.461
He chose...

01:53:28.529 --> 01:53:30.861
poorly.

01:53:40.308 --> 01:53:42.970
lt would not be made
out of gold.

01:53:43.044 --> 01:53:45.205
That's the cup
of a carpenter.

01:53:55.056 --> 01:53:57.217
There's only one way
to find out.

01:54:11.539 --> 01:54:16.203
You have chosen wisely.

01:54:16.277 --> 01:54:21.146
But the Grail cannot pass
beyond the Great Seal.

01:54:21.215 --> 01:54:26.050
That is the boundary
and the price of immortality.

01:55:52.773 --> 01:55:55.640
Drop your guns. Please.

01:55:58.879 --> 01:56:00.642
Dad, come on,
get to your feet.

01:56:14.562 --> 01:56:17.156
We have got it. Come on!

01:56:18.666 --> 01:56:21.134
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!

01:56:21.202 --> 01:56:23.227
lt's ours, lndy--
yours and mine.

01:56:23.304 --> 01:56:25.363
Elsa, don't cross the Seal.

01:56:25.439 --> 01:56:26.633
The knight warned us

01:56:26.707 --> 01:56:28.937
not to take
the Grail from here.

01:56:55.503 --> 01:56:56.527
Junior!

01:56:56.604 --> 01:56:58.003
Junior!

01:57:00.841 --> 01:57:01.500
Elsa...

01:57:03.210 --> 01:57:05.201
Elsa, don't. Elsa...

01:57:05.279 --> 01:57:06.712
Elsa...

01:57:06.781 --> 01:57:08.248
Give me your other hand, honey.

01:57:08.315 --> 01:57:09.339
l can't hold you!

01:57:09.417 --> 01:57:10.782
l can reach it.

01:57:10.851 --> 01:57:12.546
l can reach it.

01:57:12.620 --> 01:57:14.349
Elsa, give me your hand.
Give me your other hand!

01:57:16.891 --> 01:57:17.880
Elsa!

01:57:27.968 --> 01:57:30.300
Junior, give me
your other hand!

01:57:30.371 --> 01:57:32.236
l can't hold on.

01:57:32.306 --> 01:57:33.568
l can get it.

01:57:33.641 --> 01:57:35.836
l can almost reach it, Dad.

01:57:35.976 --> 01:57:37.568
lndiana...

01:58:13.848 --> 01:58:15.440
Please, Dad.

01:58:46.580 --> 01:58:49.447
Elsa never really
believed in the Grail.

01:58:49.517 --> 01:58:52.213
She thought she'd
found a prize.

01:58:58.692 --> 01:59:01.092
What did you find, Dad?

01:59:01.162 --> 01:59:02.652

01:59:05.366 --> 01:59:06.890
lllumination.

01:59:16.410 --> 01:59:17.934
And what did you find, Junior?

01:59:18.012 --> 01:59:20.947
''Junior''? Dad...

01:59:21.015 --> 01:59:22.812
Please, what does
it always mean,

01:59:22.950 --> 01:59:24.212

01:59:24.285 --> 01:59:26.412
That's his name:
Henry Jones, Junior.

01:59:26.487 --> 01:59:28.148

01:59:28.222 --> 01:59:29.587

01:59:29.657 --> 01:59:31.056

01:59:32.459 --> 01:59:33.619
The dog?

01:59:35.462 --> 01:59:37.521
You are named after the dog?

01:59:38.666 --> 01:59:42.932
l've got a lot of fond memories
of that dog.

01:59:43.003 --> 01:59:45.767
Ready?

01:59:45.839 --> 01:59:47.466
Ready.

01:59:47.541 --> 01:59:49.509

Got lost
in his own museum, huh?

01:59:58.052 --> 01:59:59.815
Uh-huh.
