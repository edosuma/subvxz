15:21.755 --> 15:23.005
'you lost everything

15:21.755 --> 15:23.005
you cared about.'

15:23.047 --> 15:24.965
I don't need music.

15:25.007 --> 15:27.260
My life is good now!

15:27.301 --> 15:28.595
I mean, uh..

15:28.636 --> 15:31.389
...sure, I've put on

15:28.636 --> 15:31.389
a few pounds

15:31.431 --> 15:35.685
and, uh...I've

15:31.431 --> 15:35.685
developed this..

15:35.727 --> 15:39.480
...nasty scalp infection.

15:39.522 --> 15:42.149
But I'm getting it together,

15:39.522 --> 15:42.149
alright?

15:42.191 --> 15:45.278
I have a brand-new

15:42.191 --> 15:45.278
beautiful<i> fiancée.</i>

15:45.319 --> 15:48.989
Yes, indeed, I'm<i> back</i>

15:45.319 --> 15:48.989
on top again, alright?

15:49.031 --> 15:51.910
I'm the king of my castle!

15:51.951 --> 15:53.953
'Where is that slob?'

15:55.246 --> 15:57.498
Hey, baldy!

15:57.540 --> 15:59.125
Gibbler!

15:59.166 --> 16:01.168
You promised

15:59.166 --> 16:01.168
to massage my feet!

16:01.210 --> 16:02.629
I-I-I remember, sweet.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.547
Uh, well,

16:02.670 --> 16:04.547
you are my queen

16:04.589 --> 16:07.216
so, up on

16:04.589 --> 16:07.216
your throne.'

16:08.468 --> 16:10.344
There you are again.

16:10.386 --> 16:11.763
Get to work, you load!

16:11.805 --> 16:14.181
My corns are ready to pop.

16:14.223 --> 16:16.768
I know what

16:14.223 --> 16:16.768
you're thinking out there.

16:16.810 --> 16:19.562
But you can't have her.

16:16.810 --> 16:19.562
She's all mine.

16:21.564 --> 16:24.150
Whoa! Look at that one.

16:21.564 --> 16:24.150
That one's really ripe.

16:24.191 --> 16:25.944
Oh, yeah.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.696
My, it is ripe!

16:28.738 --> 16:30.949
My life is good.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.283
My life is good.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.703
My life is good.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.371
My..

16:40.959 --> 16:44.211
Come on, Joey,

16:40.959 --> 16:44.211
it'll be better in here.

16:48.758 --> 16:52.345
How could you guys do this

16:48.758 --> 16:52.345
right in front of me?

16:52.386 --> 16:55.097
Joey got cream filling

16:52.386 --> 16:55.097
in his eye.

16:55.139 --> 16:56.557
Yeah, those boing boings

16:55.139 --> 16:56.557
are really packed

16:56.599 --> 16:58.518
under pressure,

16:56.599 --> 16:58.518
you grab one and..

16:58.559 --> 17:00.436
...you know, right into there.

17:00.478 --> 17:02.772
So there's nothing going on

17:00.478 --> 17:02.772
between the two of you?

17:02.814 --> 17:05.065
Joey's just an idiot?

17:05.107 --> 17:07.777
Is there a third choice?

17:07.819 --> 17:09.863
I got to go change my eye.

17:09.904 --> 17:11.113
Sweetheart, are you okay?

17:11.155 --> 17:13.240
Oh, honey,

17:11.155 --> 17:13.240
I had this<i> horrific</i> dream.

17:13.282 --> 17:14.993
You know, I-I really do realize

17:15.034 --> 17:16.703
I need music in my life!

17:16.744 --> 17:17.912
I mean, next to you

17:16.744 --> 17:17.912
and the boys

17:17.954 --> 17:19.664
it's the most

17:17.954 --> 17:19.664
important thing to me.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.708
Well, I'd say you had

17:19.706 --> 17:21.708
a very successful nap.

17:21.749 --> 17:23.125
Yeah, well, I'll tell you

17:21.749 --> 17:23.125
something else.

17:23.167 --> 17:25.211
I'm gonna stop obsessing

17:23.167 --> 17:25.211
over this Rippers thing.

17:25.252 --> 17:27.672
Otherwise, I'm gonna end up

17:25.252 --> 17:27.672
a fat, pathetic has-been

17:27.714 --> 17:29.256
with a scalp infection.

17:30.967 --> 17:33.887
By the way,

17:30.967 --> 17:33.887
how is my hair?

17:33.928 --> 17:35.179
Perfect, as usual.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.306
Aw, honey, relax.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.306
The dream is over.

17:37.348 --> 17:39.934
I know.

17:37.348 --> 17:39.934
I know, honey.

17:39.976 --> 17:42.812
Hey, you guys got

17:39.976 --> 17:42.812
any corn plasters?

17:42.854 --> 17:44.480

17:59.620 --> 18:00.788
I'll get that.

18:00.830 --> 18:03.123
Wouldn't want anyone

18:00.830 --> 18:03.123
to lose their place.

18:07.879 --> 18:10.464
- Deej, is that you?

18:07.879 --> 18:10.464
- 'Open the door, Steph.'

18:10.506 --> 18:14.343
Oh, Deej, I'm<i> so</i> glad

18:10.506 --> 18:14.343
you're here.

18:14.385 --> 18:15.678
Dad!

18:16.846 --> 18:18.180
It's somebody's dad!

18:23.352 --> 18:24.604
Dad.

18:25.563 --> 18:26.689
I know you're angry.

18:26.731 --> 18:29.609
Or this may be

18:26.731 --> 18:29.609
a personal best for me.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.946
- Mr. Tanner, hi.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.946
- Hi.

18:32.987 --> 18:34.280
Gia?

18:34.321 --> 18:36.323
Mom? Hi!

18:37.909 --> 18:39.285
How nice, huh?

18:39.326 --> 18:40.578
My shift ended early

18:40.620 --> 18:43.039
so, you, uh, threw me

18:40.620 --> 18:43.039
a little party!

18:43.081 --> 18:45.249
This place is crawling

18:43.081 --> 18:45.249
with parents.

18:45.291 --> 18:46.918
Let's get out of here.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.461
Let's go.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.213
Hey, hey, hey!

18:49.462 --> 18:51.213
Nice try!

18:53.173 --> 18:55.676
Do you have any idea

18:53.173 --> 18:55.676
what your daughter's been up to?

18:55.718 --> 18:59.346
Do you have any idea

18:55.718 --> 18:59.346
how ridiculous you sound?

18:59.388 --> 19:01.307
Yes. I have laryngitis.

19:01.348 --> 19:03.350
He belongs to you,

19:01.348 --> 19:03.350
right?

19:03.392 --> 19:05.019
- He's my dad.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.019
- Mm-hmm.

19:05.061 --> 19:06.062
That's right!

19:06.104 --> 19:07.647
You two haven't met.

19:07.688 --> 19:10.232
Mr. Tanner, this is Claire..

19:10.274 --> 19:13.987
...my beautiful,

19:10.274 --> 19:13.987
forgiving mother.

19:14.028 --> 19:16.155
I don't want

19:14.028 --> 19:16.155
to hear it, Gia.

19:16.196 --> 19:18.365
I'll just go

19:16.196 --> 19:18.365
to my room.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.954
Steph, why don't you

19:19.826 --> 19:22.954
just go to Gia's room?

19:26.082 --> 19:27.667
I don't know if you realize

19:26.082 --> 19:27.667
what's been going on here.

19:27.708 --> 19:29.585
- Where are you going?

19:27.708 --> 19:29.585
- I'm listening.

19:29.627 --> 19:31.838
Keep squeaking.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.297
Funny, I walk in here

19:33.339 --> 19:34.924
there's hugging,

19:33.339 --> 19:34.924
there's kissing

19:34.966 --> 19:36.425
there's feet upon

19:34.966 --> 19:36.425
the furniture.

19:36.467 --> 19:37.426
There's, you don't even--

19:37.468 --> 19:38.761
[grunting]

19:38.803 --> 19:40.721
Oh, that's horrible!

19:40.763 --> 19:42.264
What is that?

19:40.763 --> 19:42.264
I don't know where's it been.

19:42.306 --> 19:43.683
I don't know what's in it.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.059
I don't know if I can

19:43.724 --> 19:45.059
operate heavy machinery now.

19:45.101 --> 19:46.144
I don't know why

19:45.101 --> 19:46.144
my voice is back.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.145
What's in there?

19:47.186 --> 19:49.105
Family secret.

19:49.147 --> 19:50.439
So well, where were we?

19:50.481 --> 19:52.483
Oh,<i> yes,</i> you were<i> attacking</i>

19:52.525 --> 19:54.944
the way I raise my daughter.

19:54.986 --> 19:56.863
No, I mean, how could you

19:56.904 --> 19:58.238
not know that your daughter

19:58.280 --> 19:59.782
was having a make-out party?

19:59.824 --> 20:01.575
Well, kind of like the way

19:59.824 --> 20:01.575
<i>you</i> didn't know

20:01.617 --> 20:03.410
your daughter was<i> going</i>

20:01.617 --> 20:03.410
to a make-out party.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.163
kinda like that.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.790
It's not my fault.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.790
She lied to me!

20:07.832 --> 20:09.416
Welcome to the club!

20:09.458 --> 20:11.002
Oh, so there's a club now?

20:11.044 --> 20:14.630
What is it,

20:11.044 --> 20:14.630
"Parents Of Future Felons?"

20:14.672 --> 20:17.800
Yeah, we have

20:14.672 --> 20:17.800
a secret handshake.

20:20.511 --> 20:23.139
Look, I'm sorry.

20:23.181 --> 20:24.849
I think, maybe it was easier

20:23.181 --> 20:24.849
for me to get mad at you

20:24.891 --> 20:27.476
than get mad at myself.

20:27.518 --> 20:28.936
Well, we, you know,

20:27.518 --> 20:28.936
could

20:28.978 --> 20:31.271
just both be mad

20:28.978 --> 20:31.271
at our kids.

20:32.190 --> 20:34.817
That's a good idea.

20:34.859 --> 20:36.194
You know, the truth is that, uh

20:36.235 --> 20:37.361
Gia's had a really hard time

20:37.403 --> 20:40.364
ever since her dad

20:37.403 --> 20:40.364
and I split up.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.366
You know, but lately,

20:40.406 --> 20:42.366
she was turning around.

20:42.408 --> 20:45.119
God, she quit smoking,

20:42.408 --> 20:45.119
her grades got better.

20:45.161 --> 20:47.830
Steph was having

20:45.161 --> 20:47.830
such a good influence on her.

20:49.289 --> 20:52.960
- Steph's a good kid.

20:49.289 --> 20:52.960
- Gia is, too.

20:53.002 --> 20:54.879
Well...I suppose

20:53.002 --> 20:54.879
I should go in there

20:54.921 --> 20:56.797
and talk to her.

20:56.839 --> 20:58.716
Mm-hmm...well, just remember

20:58.758 --> 21:01.802
when-when children seem

20:58.758 --> 21:01.802
the least lovable

21:01.844 --> 21:04.597
it means they need

21:01.844 --> 21:04.597
love the most.

21:04.638 --> 21:07.307
Do you always talk

21:04.638 --> 21:07.307
like a fortune cookie?

21:08.642 --> 21:10.603
Actually, it-it was

21:08.642 --> 21:10.603

21:10.644 --> 21:12.438
on my Ziggy

21:10.644 --> 21:12.438

21:13.773 --> 21:15.108
Well, when you go in,

21:13.773 --> 21:15.108
would you send out

21:15.149 --> 21:16.483
my little co-defendant, please?

21:16.525 --> 21:18.027
Yeah, sure.

21:18.069 --> 21:19.403
You know, by the way,

21:18.069 --> 21:19.403
your, uh

21:19.445 --> 21:21.488

21:31.165 --> 21:32.750

21:32.792 --> 21:34.418
I'll remember that.

21:49.516 --> 21:50.851

21:51.685 --> 21:53.312
Listen.

21:53.353 --> 21:54.605
I'm really sorry.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.607
I messed up

21:54.647 --> 21:56.607
big time.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.234
Well, let's see,

21:56.649 --> 21:58.234
you lied shamelessly

21:58.276 --> 22:00.486
you went to a make-out party

21:58.276 --> 22:00.486
you got in way over your head.

22:00.527 --> 22:03.030
Yeah, I-I'd say, "messed up big

22:00.527 --> 22:03.030
time" about covers it.

22:03.072 --> 22:05.158
- I know.

22:03.072 --> 22:05.158
- But on the upside--

22:05.199 --> 22:07.367
- There's an upside?

22:05.199 --> 22:07.367
- A small one.

22:08.494 --> 22:11.413
You, uh...you did

22:08.494 --> 22:11.413
the right thing.

22:11.455 --> 22:12.873
I did?

22:12.915 --> 22:16.418
Yeah. Calling home

22:12.915 --> 22:16.418
showed good judgment.

22:16.460 --> 22:18.254
You got yourself

22:16.460 --> 22:18.254
in an uncomfortable situation

22:18.296 --> 22:20.422
but you took control of it.

22:20.464 --> 22:24.177
So does good judgment

22:20.464 --> 22:24.177
cancel out shameless lying?

22:25.970 --> 22:28.889
Steph, let me

22:25.970 --> 22:28.889
put it this way.

22:42.945 --> 22:45.031

of submitting it.
