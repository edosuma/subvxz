00:21.209 --> 00:22.876
Sorry!
He's not usually like this.

00:22.877 --> 00:23.977
Leash aggression.

00:23.978 --> 00:24.778
Come on, come on.

00:26.780 --> 00:27.913
Ryan! Oh, my God.

00:27.914 --> 00:30.348
It's been a while.

00:30.349 --> 00:32.616
Yeah. My new job
is pretty intense.

00:32.618 --> 00:34.986
Long hours.

00:34.987 --> 00:36.755
I was actually
on my way there now,

00:36.756 --> 00:39.424
but I wanted to stop by
and say hi.

00:39.425 --> 00:41.226
Well...

00:41.227 --> 00:43.227
uh, yeah, I'm...
I'm really glad you did.

00:46.599 --> 00:48.133
You want to come in?

00:48.134 --> 00:49.769
Yeah.

00:52.307 --> 00:54.074
So, Wilfred's back from
Wisconsin, huh?

00:54.075 --> 00:56.209
I guess that means Drew...

00:56.210 --> 00:58.446
Ryan can see clearly
now the rain is gone!

00:59.648 --> 01:00.781
What's up, bro!

01:00.782 --> 01:02.750
Mm, welcome back, Drew.

01:02.751 --> 01:04.819
Good to see you, man.

01:04.819 --> 01:05.920
Did you hear the news?

01:05.921 --> 01:08.724
I'm moving to L.A.

01:08.725 --> 01:10.659
For reals this time!

01:10.660 --> 01:13.695
Finally tying
the ol' knot-a-roo.

01:13.696 --> 01:15.764
That's great.

01:15.765 --> 01:17.599
Wow.

01:17.600 --> 01:19.200
Well, I can't believe
it's been three months

01:19.201 --> 01:20.869
since I've seen Wilfred.

01:20.870 --> 01:21.770
Oh, he's going to be
so excited.

01:21.771 --> 01:23.773
Wilfred!

01:23.774 --> 01:24.807
Wilfy!

01:24.808 --> 01:25.808
Guess who's here!

01:28.112 --> 01:30.447
Drew-be-do-be-do!

01:30.448 --> 01:32.283
What's up, bro!

01:34.853 --> 01:37.988
I finally taught Wilfy
how to shake.

01:40.158 --> 01:41.692
Hey, buddy.

01:41.693 --> 01:45.796
I brought you your ball.

01:45.797 --> 01:47.265
Drew, have you seen this?

01:47.266 --> 01:48.633
Jordy Nelson's
high ankle sprain

01:48.634 --> 01:49.901
isn't as bad as we thought.

01:49.902 --> 01:51.002
Might even start Sunday.

01:51.003 --> 01:52.237
Thank God.

01:52.238 --> 01:54.673
Nelson really takes
the top of the defense.

01:56.076 --> 01:59.179
Uh... I don't think
he remembers me.

01:59.180 --> 02:00.147
Of course he does.

02:00.148 --> 02:01.048
Just give him a second.

02:01.049 --> 02:02.450
Hey, you want some coffee?

02:02.451 --> 02:04.518
Warning, bro.

02:04.519 --> 02:05.853
It's decaf.

02:05.854 --> 02:07.755
All that's allowed
these days.

02:07.756 --> 02:09.424
If it means that much
to you, Drew.

02:09.425 --> 02:10.925
You can drink
whatever you want.

02:10.925 --> 02:13.161
Okay, Wilfy,
want to play some catch?

02:13.162 --> 02:14.162
Huh? Come on!

02:14.163 --> 02:15.430
Hells, yeah!

02:15.431 --> 02:17.666
"Catch" is the shit!

02:20.971 --> 02:22.872
I'm so glad you stopped by.

02:22.873 --> 02:26.342
I thought maybe you were,
I don't know, avoiding me.

02:26.343 --> 02:29.045
Work's been crazy.

02:30.548 --> 02:32.950
Well, I've missed you.

02:32.951 --> 02:35.085
By the way, I'm sure you've
noticed... I'm not pregnant.

02:35.086 --> 02:36.653
False positive.

02:36.654 --> 02:38.922
Uh, sorry to hear that.

02:38.923 --> 02:40.624
It's okay. I mean...

02:40.625 --> 02:42.893
that's why Drew and
I got engaged but...

02:42.894 --> 02:46.096
we're still really
excited about the wedding.

02:50.935 --> 02:52.302
Come on! Whip it over here!

02:52.303 --> 02:53.703
Let's see that arm, champ!

02:56.941 --> 02:58.107
My bad. My bad.

02:58.108 --> 02:59.976
It's just under
the bush over here.

02:59.977 --> 03:02.979
I'm all over it Drew-ish
Community Center.

03:02.980 --> 03:04.481
Hey. I just wanted
to say good-bye.

03:04.482 --> 03:06.016
Gotta head to the office.

03:06.017 --> 03:09.252
Listen, I'm sorry you had to
witness that squabble in there.

03:09.253 --> 03:11.088
Things have been sort of tense
between me and Jenna.

03:11.089 --> 03:12.823
Really?

03:12.824 --> 03:14.191
I didn't notice.

03:14.192 --> 03:16.326
Yeah, she was going through
my luggage yesterday

03:16.327 --> 03:19.096
and she found a bottle of
this stuff called Maxtanol.

03:19.097 --> 03:21.465
They're over-the-counter
but, turns out,

03:21.466 --> 03:24.301
technically,
they're kind of steroids.

03:24.302 --> 03:26.804
And I had no idea.
A guy at the gym

03:26.805 --> 03:29.273
turned me on to them
for maximum core rippage.

03:29.274 --> 03:32.343
Of course,
Jenna assumed the worse.

03:32.344 --> 03:34.178
Got it!

03:34.179 --> 03:35.613
All right, Wilfy!

03:35.614 --> 03:37.014
Bring it back.

03:37.015 --> 03:38.082
Here you go, bro.

03:38.083 --> 03:38.949
Here's the ball.

03:38.950 --> 03:39.983
Right where you wanted it.

03:39.984 --> 03:41.818
All the way back.

03:41.819 --> 03:44.188
Oh. Right, right, right.

03:44.189 --> 03:45.289
Of course.

03:45.290 --> 03:46.290
Good boy.

03:46.291 --> 03:47.758
Let go.

03:47.759 --> 03:49.126
Let... go.

03:49.127 --> 03:50.461
Wilfy, let go!

03:50.462 --> 03:52.530
<i>Oh, uh, you wanted
the ball.</i>

03:52.531 --> 03:53.931
Right. Sorry.

03:53.932 --> 03:55.733
I don't know why I do that.

03:55.734 --> 03:58.236
Come on, Wilfred,
get your head in the game!

03:58.237 --> 04:00.872
Wow, Wilfred seems
really into playing catch.

04:00.873 --> 04:04.142
Yeah, I took him to my parents
lake house after the accident.

04:04.143 --> 04:05.544
We totally bonded.

04:05.545 --> 04:08.146
Wilfy got in the best
shape of his life.

04:08.147 --> 04:09.848
Nothing like a little fresh
Wisconsin air

04:09.849 --> 04:11.450
to get you back on your feet.

04:11.451 --> 04:12.951
Okay, I got this one!

04:12.952 --> 04:14.319
Let's do this!
Drew! Drew!

04:14.320 --> 04:16.154
Drew! Drew! Drew! Drew!

04:16.156 --> 04:17.990
Aw, shit!

04:17.991 --> 04:21.527
Although,
let's be honest,

04:21.528 --> 04:23.396
he's never going to be
a champion.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.898
Oh, Jesus, Drew!

04:24.899 --> 04:26.399
I just tripped of over
your suitcase

04:26.400 --> 04:27.534
for, like, the fifth
time this morning!

04:27.535 --> 04:29.303
Could you please finish
unpacking?!

04:29.304 --> 04:31.405
Coming, sweetie!

04:43.953 --> 04:48.123
Wilfred, I know you're having
trouble remembering who I am,

04:48.124 --> 04:50.392
but I hope that, with time...

04:50.393 --> 04:53.161
I remember you, Ryan.

04:53.162 --> 04:54.996
Memory is like
the Packers when

04:54.997 --> 04:57.732
they're behind by two touchdowns
in the fourth quarter.

04:57.733 --> 05:00.168
It comes back.

05:00.169 --> 05:03.071
So...

05:03.072 --> 05:04.305
How have you been?

05:04.306 --> 05:06.240
Wisconsin was kick-ass.

05:06.241 --> 05:08.109
There's a beautiful lake there.

05:08.110 --> 05:10.644
I took 37 shits in it.

05:10.645 --> 05:12.413
But you always thought
Drew was a dick.

05:15.217 --> 05:18.486
Drew picked up the
broken bundle of bones

05:18.487 --> 05:21.588
I called a body, after
that car accident.

05:21.589 --> 05:24.525
He helped create what
you see before you.

05:26.461 --> 05:28.228
We've showered together.

05:28.229 --> 05:30.897
I won't say another
bad word about him.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.165
I'd appreciate that.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.467
Look, I just,
really need you

05:34.468 --> 05:37.303
Geez.

05:37.304 --> 05:39.839
They're clearly
having problems.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.374
Should I say something?

05:41.375 --> 05:43.977
Like what, Ryan?

05:43.978 --> 05:46.346
Drew and Jenna are getting
married... get over it.

05:46.347 --> 05:48.115
Yeah, but,
they're only getting married

05:48.116 --> 05:49.816
because Jenna thought
she was pregnant.

05:49.817 --> 05:51.918
And she only thought that
because I switched her pee

05:51.919 --> 05:53.520
for that drug test.

05:53.521 --> 05:55.488
Don't you think I need
to do the right thing and...

05:55.489 --> 05:59.158
You know, spending
the last few months

05:59.159 --> 06:01.594
with Drew, sitting on the
couch, watching A-Rodge

06:01.595 --> 06:04.764
thread needles, doing
chest and back Tuesdays,

06:04.765 --> 06:08.034
arms and cardio Thursdays,
not having to help

06:08.035 --> 06:09.702
solve any deep,
emotional problems,

06:09.703 --> 06:12.271
it helped me realize this little
relationship of ours

06:12.272 --> 06:13.773
has been very one-sided.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.608
What do you mean?

06:15.609 --> 06:17.610
I mean, you're selfish.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.478
From now on,
if you got a problem,

06:19.479 --> 06:23.783
figure it out yourself.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.584
Wait, Wilfred, I need you.

06:25.585 --> 06:29.488
Well, I don't need you,
Ry-Am Woman, Hear Me Roar.

06:29.489 --> 06:32.024
You're on your own.

06:43.347 --> 06:45.949
Hey, you know, I was thinking
rather than ordering in,

06:45.950 --> 06:48.918
maybe you an I could
grab a bite at Cestone's?

06:48.919 --> 06:51.121
Actually, I brought my lunch.

06:51.122 --> 06:53.223
Oh, okay.

06:55.292 --> 06:57.727
You know what,
I don't get it.

06:57.728 --> 06:59.529
I've calculated
my facial proportions

06:59.530 --> 07:01.965
and I am 94% symmetrical.

07:01.966 --> 07:05.235
Which, according to the index,
is borderline hot.

07:05.236 --> 07:08.105
And I dressed up this
boring old lab coat

07:08.106 --> 07:11.042
with the quirky Japanese robot
pin, so you know I'm fun.

07:11.043 --> 07:12.610
And everyone in the office
already knows

07:12.611 --> 07:14.980
- I am a total sex addict.
- What?

07:14.981 --> 07:17.148
And see, I have this
edgy sense of humor

07:17.149 --> 07:19.017
which sometimes crosses
the line...

07:20.419 --> 07:23.855
...like right now,
for instance.

07:25.391 --> 07:28.192
Oh, God, you totally
have a girlfriend, don't you?

07:28.193 --> 07:30.629
Uh, not exactly.

07:30.630 --> 07:32.364
Look, Amanda,
you seem great.

07:32.365 --> 07:34.299
Ooh, this is awkward.

07:34.300 --> 07:36.268
You know, I'm just going
to go have sex

07:36.269 --> 07:37.269
with whoever's in
the men's room.

07:38.838 --> 07:40.873
Well, there's that edgy
sense of humor again, so...

07:40.874 --> 07:42.407
good stuff.

07:48.115 --> 07:50.249
Hey.

07:50.250 --> 07:51.884
Hey.

07:51.885 --> 07:54.053
I like the suit.
You look nice.

07:54.054 --> 07:55.321
You, too.
What?

07:55.322 --> 07:57.256
My mustard-stained
sweatpants?

07:57.257 --> 08:00.626
Mustard stains are
the new black.

08:02.029 --> 08:03.796
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

08:03.797 --> 08:05.698
I'm just...

08:09.403 --> 08:12.773
Relationships
can be, uh, tough.

08:12.774 --> 08:16.510
You could always
call it off.

08:16.511 --> 08:20.581
Call what off?
My eight-year relationship?

08:20.582 --> 08:23.317
It was a joke.

08:23.318 --> 08:25.652
A bad joke.

08:25.653 --> 08:27.254
I'm sorry.

08:27.255 --> 08:29.857
No, it's my bad.

08:29.858 --> 08:32.126
I don't have much of a
sense of humor these days.

08:34.263 --> 08:36.297
I'll see ya.

08:36.298 --> 08:38.533
See ya.

08:46.107 --> 08:48.308
Hey! Small world.

08:48.309 --> 08:50.210
You jog, huh?

08:50.211 --> 08:52.814
It's Thursday, Ryan.
I told you, arms and cardio.

08:52.815 --> 08:54.448
So what was up with
Drew this morning?

08:54.449 --> 08:56.183
I woke up at 6:00

08:56.184 --> 08:57.685
when he slammed the
car door and sped off.

08:57.686 --> 08:59.119
Was he pissed off
about something?

08:59.120 --> 09:00.420
Drew drives hard.

09:00.421 --> 09:01.755
Dude's confident
behind the wheel.

09:01.756 --> 09:03.523
Did he and Jenna
have another argument?

09:05.393 --> 09:07.894
Relax, I'm not asking
for advice or anything.

09:07.895 --> 09:09.595
I'm just trying to
make small talk.

09:09.596 --> 09:11.464
And I'm just trying to
focus on my pace.

09:11.465 --> 09:14.132
Uh, seven minute miles...
ever heard of 'em?

09:14.133 --> 09:15.667
So you think Jenna might...

09:15.668 --> 09:17.336
Dude, are you still
sweating over that?

09:17.337 --> 09:18.804
I told you, it's over.
Let it go.

09:18.805 --> 09:20.039
Yeah, but...

09:20.040 --> 09:22.640
Okay, c-can we just
slow down for a second?

09:22.641 --> 09:24.242
Why?

09:24.243 --> 09:26.144
So we can spend the whole day
talking about your problems,

09:26.145 --> 09:27.379
you selfish prick?

09:27.380 --> 09:28.814
I'm not Dr. Phil, okay?

09:28.815 --> 09:30.582
I'm Dr. Wilfred.

09:30.583 --> 09:32.351
And I only call myself that
when I'm DJ'ing.

09:32.352 --> 09:34.419
What do you want me to say?

09:34.420 --> 09:36.422
- I need your help.
- And what about my problems?!

09:36.423 --> 09:39.591
You don't think
I'm dying inside right now

09:39.592 --> 09:41.961
because Drew thinks
I'm a loser?!

09:41.962 --> 09:44.196
I guess I never
thought about it.

09:45.965 --> 09:48.401
If this bromance
is going to work,

09:48.402 --> 09:50.936
we need to have
an equal relationship.

09:50.937 --> 09:53.873
Like those two guys
over there.

09:53.874 --> 09:55.740
Those... guys?

09:55.741 --> 09:57.742
Yeah. See that one guy?

09:57.743 --> 09:59.410
He's scratching the other
guy behind the ear.

09:59.411 --> 10:01.445
And the first guy, he's psyched,

10:01.446 --> 10:03.948
because he's helping the other
guy, who's his friend.

10:03.949 --> 10:06.917
Now, the first guy,
he's throwing that ball.

10:06.918 --> 10:08.786
And the other guy,
the naked hairy guy,

10:08.787 --> 10:10.254
he's running
and bringing it back,

10:10.255 --> 10:11.756
because that's what
bros do for each other.

10:13.292 --> 10:16.227
It goes both ways,
R-R-R-Ry-Sharona.

10:19.965 --> 10:21.165
Get in there.
Get in there.

10:21.166 --> 10:22.400
Good. Get in there.
Get in there.

10:22.401 --> 10:24.435
Tunnel!

10:24.436 --> 10:26.137
Come on, up, up.

10:26.138 --> 10:27.572
Stay, stay, stay.

10:30.243 --> 10:32.811
Nice grab, bro.

10:32.812 --> 10:34.446
Hey, cute, pooch.

10:34.447 --> 10:36.615
- What's the breed?
- Um, he's uh...

10:36.616 --> 10:38.984
- Time to stand up.
- I don't really know.

10:38.985 --> 10:41.887
Couldn't even do that
for me, eh, Ryan?

10:41.888 --> 10:43.288
Keeps you guessin', huh?

10:43.289 --> 10:45.824
You have no idea.

10:45.825 --> 10:47.593
Hey, Jellybeans, huh?

10:47.594 --> 10:48.895
What's up, bro?

10:48.896 --> 10:51.131
Hey, you look good out there.

10:51.132 --> 10:53.600
Let's, on the count of three,
both say what we can bench.

10:53.601 --> 10:55.235
One, two, three...

10:55.236 --> 10:56.536
35 pounds.

10:56.537 --> 10:58.138
Hey, you didn't say it.

10:58.139 --> 10:59.773
Oh, oh, what?
You're ignoring me now?

10:59.774 --> 11:01.424
You're better than me,

11:01.425 --> 11:03.126
you beautiful
golden-haired prick?

11:03.127 --> 11:04.478
Jellybeans has been training

11:04.479 --> 11:06.747
all month for the Health Kibble
Incredible Dog Challenge.

11:06.748 --> 11:08.682
Kind of a fun thing
to do on a Saturday.

11:08.683 --> 11:09.950
Huh, kid?

11:09.951 --> 11:11.185
Yeah, that's it!

11:11.186 --> 11:12.953
Attaboy.

11:12.954 --> 11:14.555
If I can win this competition,

11:14.556 --> 11:16.624
then Drew will finally
see me as a champion.

11:16.625 --> 11:19.026
But Jenna would never let Drew
enter me into the contest.

11:19.027 --> 11:22.530
He's not allowed to do anything
even slightly competitive.

11:22.531 --> 11:24.465
Well, maybe I could
sign you up.

11:24.466 --> 11:26.434
I was on the track team
in high school.

11:26.435 --> 11:29.403
I could train you.

11:29.404 --> 11:30.771
You'd do that for me?

11:30.772 --> 11:32.806
Wait. What's in it for you?

11:32.807 --> 11:34.708
Come on, Wilfred,
I'm your friend.

11:34.709 --> 11:36.576
Cut the shit.

11:36.577 --> 11:38.979
You just need me to help you
solve your little Jenna dilemma.

11:38.980 --> 11:40.848
Okay, fine.

11:40.849 --> 11:42.349
You're right.

11:42.350 --> 11:43.484
Do we have a deal?

11:46.120 --> 11:47.487
Deal.

11:47.488 --> 11:48.555
Weak grip, mate.

11:50.024 --> 11:52.025
Flexbar Hand Exerciser,
ever heard of it?

11:56.397 --> 11:58.499
What are you doing?

11:58.500 --> 12:00.701
Just studying some
film from practice.

12:05.607 --> 12:08.475
Listen, I-I was thinking
maybe later tonight

12:08.476 --> 12:10.344
we could start talking
about Jenna...
Oh, hang on, hang on.

12:10.345 --> 12:12.680
Look at this.
See what I did there?

12:12.681 --> 12:14.181
I got super tired,

12:14.182 --> 12:15.416
stopped running,

12:15.417 --> 12:16.550
and started dry-heaving.

12:17.886 --> 12:21.088
I've got to not do that.

12:21.089 --> 12:23.591
God! Who am I kidding?

12:26.261 --> 12:28.896
There's no way
I can beat Jellybeans.

12:28.897 --> 12:30.664
I'm never going to be
the champion he is.

12:30.665 --> 12:32.900
He's so fast, and strong!

12:32.901 --> 12:35.303
He's got the glossy coat
of a healthy one-year-old.

12:35.304 --> 12:37.072
And his nose...

12:37.073 --> 12:40.442
God, his nose gets...
so wet...

12:42.212 --> 12:44.781
Don't worry,
we'll get you there.

12:44.782 --> 12:47.550
Maybe if we took a break,
and talked.

12:47.551 --> 12:50.854
There's only one way
I can win this competition.

12:53.491 --> 12:56.593
You need to put a jar
of flesh-eating bacteria

12:56.594 --> 12:58.663
all over Jellybeans'
legs and genitals.

12:58.664 --> 13:01.065
I'm not doing that.

13:01.066 --> 13:03.568
Fine! You don't want to do
whatever it takes to help me,

13:03.569 --> 13:05.637
- the deal's off!
- W...

13:05.638 --> 13:07.005
Uh, wait, wait, wait.
Wait.

13:07.006 --> 13:08.407
You want to be
faster and stronger?

13:08.408 --> 13:10.710
What if I could get you...

13:10.711 --> 13:11.978
Maxtanol?

13:14.547 --> 13:16.648
Maxtanol?

13:16.649 --> 13:17.983
It's an over-the-counter
stimulant.

13:17.984 --> 13:19.719
Drew says that
it helps you achieve...

13:19.720 --> 13:21.988
"maximum core rippage."

13:21.989 --> 13:24.891
That's just the kind
of rippage I need.

13:24.892 --> 13:26.160
No.

13:26.161 --> 13:27.761
No, I can't.

13:27.762 --> 13:29.229
It's against my
code of ethics.

13:29.230 --> 13:30.998
Your "code of ethics"?

13:30.999 --> 13:32.466
I have a strict policy against

13:32.467 --> 13:33.834
taking any drug
that's not illegal.

13:33.835 --> 13:35.402
They're never strong enough.

13:35.403 --> 13:37.671
No, if I'm going to
win this thing for Drew,

13:37.672 --> 13:39.373
I'm going to need
the good shit.

13:39.374 --> 13:41.642
- You mean real steroids?
- I'm talking about

13:41.643 --> 13:43.577
the back-alley shit.

13:43.578 --> 13:45.879
The shit that
Kathleen Turner uses.

13:45.880 --> 13:46.980
Think you can
handle that, bro?

13:46.981 --> 13:48.415
Wilfred, I...

13:48.416 --> 13:50.317
See, this is how
friendships work, Ryan.

13:50.318 --> 13:52.218
I scratch your back,

13:52.219 --> 13:54.355
you scratch the area
directly above my penis

13:54.356 --> 13:56.591
until my leg goes apeshit.

14:04.518 --> 14:05.819
Oh, oh, oh,
ask this guy.

14:05.820 --> 14:07.487
He's perfect.

14:07.488 --> 14:09.822
- Can I help you?
- Um...

14:09.823 --> 14:11.257
Yeah.

14:11.258 --> 14:13.592
I was... I was wondering...

14:13.593 --> 14:16.061
You seem like someone that
would know where I could

14:16.062 --> 14:19.097
get something that would
make me, uh... stronger?

14:19.098 --> 14:23.201
Maybe something that... you
can't find in a health store?

14:26.038 --> 14:28.173
If you're asking me what
I think you're asking me,

14:28.174 --> 14:29.474
it's illegal.
Really?

14:29.475 --> 14:31.210
You're not on steroids?

14:31.211 --> 14:33.045
So that's, like,
your natural package?

14:34.714 --> 14:36.548
Hey, buddy.

14:36.549 --> 14:37.983
Think I know what
you're looking for.

14:43.157 --> 14:46.559
Drew is gonna shit!

14:46.560 --> 14:49.329
I'm gonna look just like
that Kathleen Turner dude.

14:50.732 --> 14:52.633
All right,
let's do this.

14:54.102 --> 14:56.303
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

14:56.304 --> 14:58.005
I-I just want steroids.

14:58.006 --> 15:00.107
Yeah, and this is what
you're gonna do to get 'em.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.742
You know what?
Never mind.

15:01.743 --> 15:03.211
Aw, typical.

15:03.212 --> 15:04.445
Won't even shlob
this guy's knob

15:04.446 --> 15:06.480
to help a friend get steroids.

15:06.481 --> 15:08.181
You selfish prick.

15:09.484 --> 15:11.652
Fine.

15:14.256 --> 15:15.824
Look, I'll give you money,

15:15.825 --> 15:18.627
but I'm not going
to do... that.

15:18.628 --> 15:19.895
Fine.

15:19.896 --> 15:21.529
150 bucks.

15:21.530 --> 15:23.031
And a hug.

15:23.032 --> 15:24.232
A hug?

15:24.233 --> 15:26.200
A long hug.

15:26.201 --> 15:28.669
I want it to be tender,
like we're sisters at a funeral.

15:41.750 --> 15:44.052
That's really good.

15:44.053 --> 15:47.222
I can feel your heart
beating against mine.

16:01.405 --> 16:03.640
Oh, hi!

16:03.641 --> 16:06.077
Ryan!

16:06.078 --> 16:07.545
This is great, Ryan!

16:07.546 --> 16:09.046
Wilfred looks like
he's having so much fun.

16:10.482 --> 16:14.720
I'm gonna go give
the little fella a pep talk.

16:14.721 --> 16:16.523
Wow.

16:16.524 --> 16:17.957
You guys seem... happy.

16:17.958 --> 16:19.526
Things are better.

16:19.527 --> 16:21.762
You know, I think we were
both sort of using Wilfred

16:21.763 --> 16:23.297
as a way to avoid our issues,

16:23.298 --> 16:25.933
but thanks to you, we got some
time alone to work things out.

16:25.934 --> 16:28.168
Awesome.

16:33.708 --> 16:37.210
God, Jenna and Drew are
even worse than I thought.

16:37.211 --> 16:39.312
It's like they've tricked
themselves into believing

16:39.313 --> 16:41.114
everything's all right,
when it's not.

16:41.115 --> 16:42.449
Ryan, please!
I'm trying to focus, here.

16:42.450 --> 16:43.783
It's hard enough with

16:43.784 --> 16:45.752
Jelly "The Intimidator" Beans
over there,

16:45.753 --> 16:48.388
staring me down,
trying to get inside my head.

16:49.457 --> 16:51.358
Oh. We get it, Beans.

16:51.359 --> 16:53.761
We all know you got tasty balls,
no need to flaunt it.

16:53.762 --> 16:55.363
Jesus,

16:55.364 --> 16:57.098
is there no limit to
this guy's arrogance?

16:57.099 --> 17:00.235
Next on deck, Wilfred!

17:00.236 --> 17:02.637
Shit! That's it,
give me the pills.

17:07.675 --> 17:09.810
Very funny, Ryan.

17:09.811 --> 17:12.480
Here we go.
Down the hatch.

17:12.481 --> 17:14.215
Whoa, you're going to
take them all at once?

17:14.217 --> 17:15.750
Um... obviously.

17:15.751 --> 17:18.086
More steroids equals
more championishness.

17:18.087 --> 17:20.288
Nah, I'm sorry,
I can't let you do this.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.923
What? Why the hell not?

17:21.924 --> 17:24.893
Wilfred, read the label.

17:24.894 --> 17:26.828
This stuff can cause liver
damage and heart disease.

17:26.829 --> 17:28.763
You're too important
to me as a friend.

17:28.764 --> 17:31.066
- You mean ex-friend.
- Fine.

17:31.067 --> 17:33.601
I won't let you do something
I know will hurt you.

17:33.602 --> 17:35.837
I'd rather let you go.

17:42.477 --> 17:44.478
You were right.

17:44.479 --> 17:45.713
I am selfish.

17:45.714 --> 17:47.814
Damn right you are.

17:47.815 --> 17:49.916
And I'm going to humiliate
myself in front of Drew!

17:51.519 --> 17:53.186
Wilfred, you're up!

17:54.555 --> 17:56.523
Yay, Wilfy!

18:01.329 --> 18:03.664
Ryan, I'm slow and I'm weak.

18:03.665 --> 18:05.499
I can't do this!

18:05.500 --> 18:06.867
Yeah, you can.

18:06.868 --> 18:08.635
You just need
the proper motivation.

18:08.636 --> 18:09.903
Whoa. Whoa!

18:09.904 --> 18:11.738
What's this about?

18:11.739 --> 18:13.473
You know I don't do
the leash thing!

18:13.474 --> 18:15.075
What's the matter, Wilfred?
It's just a little leash.

18:15.076 --> 18:16.577
Screw you, Ryan!

18:16.578 --> 18:18.679
What are you looking at,
Jellybeans?

18:18.680 --> 18:20.682
Huh? You do not want
what I'm bringing.

18:20.683 --> 18:22.250
Oh, you want some too?

18:22.251 --> 18:24.085
Let me see your papers,
you filthy immigrant!

18:24.086 --> 18:25.353
Let go!

18:25.354 --> 18:26.687
Let go!

18:26.688 --> 18:27.921
Let go!

18:37.531 --> 18:39.098
Oh, no, he's not gonna win.

18:39.099 --> 18:40.733
Ah...!

18:58.819 --> 19:00.653
No, no, no, no, no!

19:00.654 --> 19:02.588
Jellybeans!

19:02.589 --> 19:04.590
Wilfred, no!

19:10.097 --> 19:12.531
Sorry.

19:12.532 --> 19:15.534
I blocked off my whole weekend
on my calendar for your wedding.

19:15.535 --> 19:17.169
It's gonna be awesome.

19:17.170 --> 19:18.837
That really means
a lot to us, Ryan.

19:18.838 --> 19:21.240
Dude, check it out.

19:22.609 --> 19:23.943
Wilfred's all proud
of himself.

19:23.944 --> 19:25.344
That's hilarious.

19:25.345 --> 19:26.579
Hilarious?

19:26.580 --> 19:29.148
You see what it says there?
"Participant."

19:29.149 --> 19:30.516
You think they give
one of those to every dog

19:30.517 --> 19:32.050
who takes part in
the competition?

19:32.051 --> 19:35.020
They need to give you the award
for the silliest dog, Wilfy.

19:36.422 --> 19:38.323
Come on, babe.

19:38.324 --> 19:39.424
We'll see you at the car.

19:40.826 --> 19:42.627
All right...

19:42.628 --> 19:44.628
you upheld your end
of the bargain,

19:44.629 --> 19:46.864
now it's my turn.

19:46.865 --> 19:48.599
You want to know
how to deal with

19:48.600 --> 19:50.300
your little Jenna/Drew
situation?

19:50.301 --> 19:52.903
Plant that in Drew's luggage.

19:52.904 --> 19:56.439
Jenna will find it,
throw a fit,

19:56.440 --> 19:58.841
and call off her
engagement with that...

19:58.842 --> 20:02.912
unloving, emotionless...
monster.

20:02.913 --> 20:05.180
Let it go, Wilfred.

20:07.050 --> 20:10.553
But we showered together.

20:18.735 --> 20:20.135
So when I saw her
in the break room,

20:20.136 --> 20:21.437
I asked her out to dinner.

20:21.438 --> 20:23.722
She said yes.
Really?

20:23.723 --> 20:24.923
- The girl from your office?
- Yeah.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.158
That's great, Ryan!

20:26.159 --> 20:27.426
I'm happy for you, dude.

20:29.899 --> 20:32.768
www.addic7ed.com

20:33.457 --> 20:35.906
- You okay?
- Yeah.

20:35.907 --> 20:38.374
I just got reminded
of a pretty intense relationship

20:38.375 --> 20:40.088
I haven't thought about
in a while.

20:43.966 --> 20:46.890
- Jenna's couch?
- Good girl.

20:48.909 --> 20:50.795
The sex was incredible.

20:54.536 --> 20:57.588
But eventually I just got tired
of sitting around all day

20:57.589 --> 20:59.138
watching TV with her.

20:59.139 --> 21:01.849
The break up was pretty tough
on her.

21:02.305 --> 21:08.488
