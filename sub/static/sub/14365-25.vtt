00:06.223 --> 00:08.852
What is it that you wish in return?

00:08.921 --> 00:13.452
Only to be a Decepticon once again.

00:13.521 --> 00:17.687
Now, what will we be fishing
for today, my liege?

00:17.756 --> 00:21.426
Starscream's true motives.

00:23.865 --> 00:27.637
Ah, the high-and-mighty
Skyquake.

00:27.706 --> 00:30.912
You shall bow to my command.

<i>I can feel it!</i>

00:40.195 --> 00:41.395
Awkward.

00:41.464 --> 00:44.868
I will allow you
to return to our ranks.

01:02.093 --> 01:04.828
Why didn't you tell us about
the Omega keys before?

01:04.897 --> 01:06.363
You probably didn't notice,

01:06.432 --> 01:09.835
but things have been kind of
intense around here lately.

01:09.904 --> 01:13.240
So, you guys could really be
going home soon, huh?

01:13.309 --> 01:15.443
Don't worry, Raf.
You'll come visit!

01:15.512 --> 01:18.748
Once we get our place set up, he
can bunk with us, right, Bulk?

01:18.817 --> 01:19.749
Uh, Miko?

01:19.818 --> 01:22.485
You are taking me with you, right?

01:22.553 --> 01:25.521
<i>Aren't we getting ahead of
ourselves here?</i>

01:25.589 --> 01:29.558
Not only do we lack any actual
method of reaching Cybertron,

01:29.627 --> 01:34.664
but Starscream now controls the sole
means of our planet's restoration.

01:34.733 --> 01:36.799
As far as we know.

01:36.868 --> 01:39.168
You think Starscream's
rejoined the Cons?

01:39.237 --> 01:42.606
He might've used the Omega
keys to buy back Megatron's favor.

01:42.675 --> 01:43.206
Hmph.

01:43.275 --> 01:46.377
Without first trying to sell
them to the highest bidder?

01:46.446 --> 01:50.515

the nerve to contact us and ...

I am not here to fight,

03:10.148 --> 03:14.985
- The Forge of Solus Prime.
- Could be rigged to blow.

03:15.354 --> 03:18.822
Dreadwing, what do you ask in return?

03:18.891 --> 03:22.093
Only that you use it wisely.

03:22.161 --> 03:24.462
And? The Omega keys?

03:24.530 --> 03:28.132
In Megatron's possession,
under heaviest guard.

03:28.200 --> 03:32.302
Scream did make a deal with the Cons.

03:32.371 --> 03:33.737
Why?

03:33.806 --> 03:38.008
A shadow of disgrace has been
cast upon the Decepticons.

03:38.077 --> 03:42.113
It is a cause I no
longer wish to be part of.

03:42.181 --> 03:44.749
Then I appeal to you again.

03:44.818 --> 03:48.887
Join us and help end this
conflict once and for all.

03:48.955 --> 03:54.692
Betraying my kind
is not the same as accepting yours.

04:11.776 --> 04:15.511
It's no Star Saber, but I bet
it can shatter Megatron's blade

04:15.580 --> 04:18.012
and put some dents into that
ugly mug of his.

04:18.082 --> 04:19.680
It's not that kind of hammer.

04:19.750 --> 04:23.569
With the Decepticons in possession
of all four Omega keys, a more

04:23.570 --> 04:27.389
appropriate use of the Forge would
be to use it to replicate our own.

04:27.458 --> 04:30.726
Even with such power, their
reconstruction would require

04:30.795 --> 04:32.895
a level of expertise I do not possess.

04:32.963 --> 04:35.898
I guess we better hope
Megatron doesn't destroy the

04:35.967 --> 04:38.468
keys to prevent anyone from ever
going home.

04:38.537 --> 04:40.798
Megatron may be evil,

04:40.926 --> 04:44.742
but I believe he will use the
keys for their intended purpose.

04:44.810 --> 04:49.546
Then I say we let him keep
them and do the work for us.

04:49.615 --> 04:53.594
W... I mean, what difference does
it make who restores Cybertron?

04:53.729 --> 04:59.723
If Megatron revives Cybertron, he will no
doubt use it to his political advantage.

04:59.792 --> 05:01.158
[ stammers ]

05:01.226 --> 05:02.325
Y-you lost me.

05:02.394 --> 05:06.830
In all likelihood, the leader
of the Decepticons will portray

05:06.898 --> 05:12.035
himself as our planet's savior and
brand all Autobots as war criminals.

05:12.103 --> 05:14.637
The grand deception continues.

05:14.706 --> 05:18.474
Megatron's so-called
"achievement" could influence

05:18.543 --> 05:22.611
Cybertron for eons to come,
poisoning the sparks and minds

05:22.680 --> 05:27.649
of its returning citizens ...
hardly the ideal way to begin a new age.

05:27.718 --> 05:31.452
But there is hope.
For while Megatron may have the

05:31.521 --> 05:36.925
keys, he has yet to discover the
existence of the Omega lock itself.

05:36.994 --> 05:40.595
- Omega lock?
- Wait ... now you lost me.

05:40.664 --> 05:43.999
That which the four relics
were designed to activate.

05:44.067 --> 05:48.804
We must locate the device before
Megatron does, and secure it

05:48.873 --> 05:51.040
until we can recover the keys.

05:51.109 --> 05:54.510
There are no more Iacon
entries to decode.

05:54.579 --> 05:57.947
This lock could be anywhere on Earth!

05:58.015 --> 06:01.884
Actually...
it is on Cybertron.

06:01.953 --> 06:02.852
All: What?

06:02.921 --> 06:05.855
- How do you know?
- Alpha Trion revealed its

06:05.924 --> 06:10.093
location to me during the message
conveyed by the Star Saber.

06:10.161 --> 06:13.129
And you didn't think to tell us.

06:13.198 --> 06:17.633
Alpha Trion did not wish it so.

06:20.571 --> 06:22.906
With the Forge of Solus Prime,

06:22.907 --> 06:26.409
we now possess the means
of reaching Cybertron.

06:26.478 --> 06:32.816
I must work quickly, as our tactical
advantage over Megatron will not last long.

06:36.286 --> 06:41.824
<i>Dreadwing.
I have been searching for you.</i>

06:41.892 --> 06:44.659
I am at your service, Lord Megatron.

06:44.728 --> 06:48.830
I recognize that Starscream's
return to our ranks may be...

06:48.898 --> 06:53.701
difficult for you, given the loss
of your twin under his command.

06:53.770 --> 06:56.037
But your cooperation is essential.

06:56.105 --> 06:59.507
We Decepticons will be
best-equipped to rule a restored

06:59.576 --> 07:03.211
Cybertron only if we are united.

07:03.280 --> 07:07.182
Understood.
And if it pleases you, master,

07:07.251 --> 07:11.520

This is about Skyquake, isn't it?

08:04.120 --> 08:06.154
I thought we had put that behind us!

So had I!

Aah!

08:09.126 --> 08:12.294
Casualties are an unfortunate
consequence of war!

08:12.363 --> 08:15.997
But I assure you, your twin met
his end with great honor!

08:16.066 --> 08:20.335
Which you disgraced
by raising him from the dead!

08:20.404 --> 08:23.906
Oh, you know about that.
There must be something I can do,

08:23.974 --> 08:28.177
some form of reparation I can
offer to alleviate your anguish!

08:28.245 --> 08:30.879
Your spark will suffice!

08:31.080 --> 08:34.816
<i>Dreadwing!
Stand down!</i>

08:34.885 --> 08:38.754
This desecrator must pay for
his actions!

08:38.822 --> 08:41.523
You call this loyalty, master?!

08:41.592 --> 08:46.028
I said stand down!
That is an order.

08:46.097 --> 08:49.397

09:02.478 --> 09:05.780
Lord Megatron, you
have my eternal thanks.

09:05.849 --> 09:10.885
Do not ever make me regret
which one of you I spared.

09:11.720 --> 09:14.556
Is it my imagination, or has
Optimus been acting differently

09:14.625 --> 09:16.858
since that message from Alpha Trion?

09:16.927 --> 09:18.827
[ buzzing ]

09:18.896 --> 09:21.263
Yeah, he has been keeping
things from us.

09:21.332 --> 09:23.232
Even Ratchet's out of the loop.

09:23.300 --> 09:26.535
Well, give me one good reason
Optimus couldn't trust his own

09:26.604 --> 09:29.738
teammates, why he couldn't have
told us about the Omega lock.

09:29.807 --> 09:31.340
Because if he had, Megatron

09:31.408 --> 09:34.009
would've pulled it out of my
head with his patch.

09:34.078 --> 09:38.147
Like it matters. The Cons
are holding all the keys anyway.

09:39.516 --> 09:41.883
Tick tock, Knockout.
Tick tock!

09:41.952 --> 09:45.905
Megatron's expecting results,
and given what we just witnessed,

09:45.906 --> 09:49.858
I would say that we cannot
afford to disappoint our master.

09:49.927 --> 09:54.830
We? Unless nagging counts,
I haven't seen you lift a finger!

09:54.898 --> 09:57.499
I am the one who
brought him the keys.

09:57.568 --> 10:02.304
Do I really need to prove myself further
by deciphering how they operate, too?

10:02.373 --> 10:05.741
Well, perhaps if my research
hadn't been sidelined by

10:05.810 --> 10:09.779
someone's cosmetic surgery,
I might be further along right now!

10:09.848 --> 10:10.680

And we are not.

10:45.684 --> 10:50.989
Of course! Keys are useless
without something to unlock.

11:09.374 --> 11:13.978
Our ground bridge
is now a space bridge.

Our sensors are detecting a
massive Energon burst occurring

11:16.950 --> 11:18.182
outside Earth's atmosphere.

11:18.251 --> 11:20.785
A surge of that kind could
only mean one thing ...

11:23.389 --> 11:27.424
Megatron has discovered that
the Omega lock is on Cybertron.

11:27.493 --> 11:30.261
It appears we have
lost our advantage.

11:30.329 --> 11:34.265
But with Megatron unaware
that we now possess the means of

of surprise remains in our favor.

According to the landmarks
displayed by the keys,

deep the within the sea of rust.

showed to pick us up.

14:04.639 --> 14:07.079
That is because the

<i>It's not like he has
anything else to do!</i>

may have a more effective solution.

19:02.074 --> 19:03.842
Our head start won't last long.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.544
This is where Alpha Trion
said we'd find it, right?

19:06.613 --> 19:09.220
These are the coordinates.

19:13.752 --> 19:16.220
Doesn't look like much.

19:19.958 --> 19:24.528
<i>Ratchet, we have
located the Omega lock.</i>

19:24.597 --> 19:25.696
[ sighs ]

19:25.765 --> 19:27.231
At last.

19:27.299 --> 19:29.667
According to Alpha Trion,

19:29.736 --> 19:34.773
the Omega lock is a conduit
to the very Allspark itself.

19:34.842 --> 19:39.178
Optimus, an honor like this
shouldn't belong to me.

19:39.246 --> 19:42.447
[ high-pitched whining ]

19:46.586 --> 19:49.455
[ deep humming ]

20:38.100 --> 20:42.571
<i>Autobots, I would suggest
that you put a halt to your task</i>

20:42.640 --> 20:47.376
- ...and hand over those keys.
- And why would we do that?

20:57.654 --> 21:01.856
So that I may hand over the humans.

21:09.165 --> 21:11.113
And if we refuse?

21:11.614 --> 21:15.813
Then I will have no choice
but to open the pods,

21:15.814 --> 21:20.942
exposing your pets to
Cybertron's toxic atmosphere.

21:21.011 --> 21:27.882
And then we can all watch them
instantly perish, together.
