00:02.567 --> 00:03.612
It's time to take a stand
withThe Gifted.

00:03.655 --> 00:06.310
-People need something
to believe in.
-Ahh!

00:06.354 --> 00:08.095
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.138 --> 00:10.271
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.314 --> 00:11.750
9-1-1, The Resident,

00:11.794 --> 00:13.143
andLethal Weapon.

00:13.187 --> 00:15.972
-Hey, partner.
-Only on Fox.

00:17.887 --> 00:20.063
That's our target? A bank?

00:20.107 --> 00:22.283
Creed Financial was built
on mutant suffering.

00:22.326 --> 00:25.112
We hit this place,
we'll inspire an army.

00:28.202 --> 00:30.160
The people behind the attack
at the mental hospital,

00:30.204 --> 00:31.770
they took someone.
Do you know who it was?

00:31.814 --> 00:33.946
MICHAEL:
I think her name was Rebecca.

00:33.990 --> 00:36.210
We thought she was on her meds.
We were wrong.

00:36.253 --> 00:38.299
[man shouting]

00:38.342 --> 00:39.256
[gasps]

00:44.392 --> 00:46.655
ERG:
You hide yourself up there.

00:46.698 --> 00:48.178
Never hide who you are.

00:49.353 --> 00:51.355
Maybe I can take them out.

00:51.399 --> 00:53.227
It is the only chance we got.

00:55.272 --> 00:56.099
[shouts]

00:56.143 --> 00:58.449
Authorities rolled up
the whole station.

00:58.493 --> 01:00.190
Biggest mutant bust in years.

01:00.234 --> 01:01.148
You're one of us now, brother.

01:04.629 --> 01:05.891
Oh, God...

01:05.935 --> 01:09.504
I can't make it stop.

01:12.289 --> 01:14.900
[indistinct chatter]

01:14.944 --> 01:16.902
BENAZIR:
All right, listen up.

01:16.946 --> 01:19.209
I know a lot of you have been
talking about the situation

01:19.253 --> 01:21.255
at the 11th Ave. projects.

01:21.298 --> 01:24.258
Mutant families aren't getting
their leases renewed.

01:24.301 --> 01:26.260
The only folks who get
their applications looked at

01:26.303 --> 01:28.131
are the ones with no X-Gene
in their families.

01:28.175 --> 01:30.786
So we have got to let

01:30.829 --> 01:33.005
the arrivals know
that this is our hood.

01:33.049 --> 01:35.138
That they need to find
a new place to go and soon.

01:35.182 --> 01:38.010
Wait, h-hang on, Benny.
Are you seriously talking

01:38.054 --> 01:41.231
about knocking on doors and
telling families to get out?

01:41.275 --> 01:43.364
We're not gonna make
any friends.

01:43.407 --> 01:45.279
We're way past
making friends, Reeva.

01:45.322 --> 01:48.543
We've already had anti-mutant
graffiti and vandalism...

01:48.586 --> 01:50.545
Yeah-- people are
already scared of us.

01:50.588 --> 01:53.156
If we're coming to their homes
and telling them to go...

01:53.200 --> 01:55.245
BENAZIR:
Hey, you think I want this?

01:55.289 --> 01:57.247
I want to be building
playgrounds in the park.

01:57.291 --> 01:59.728
But what good is it when our
kids are too scared to go out?

01:59.771 --> 02:03.775
Benny, seriously,
th-there has to be another way.

02:03.819 --> 02:06.300
Like what?
Bring the humans a pie,

02:06.343 --> 02:08.040
tell them, "Hey, we'll go."

02:08.084 --> 02:09.825
Maybe we should turn ourselves
in to Sentinel Services

02:09.868 --> 02:13.394
-while we're at it.
-[people murmuring]

02:13.437 --> 02:16.397
[sighs]

02:16.440 --> 02:17.876
All right.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.965
Let's print out some flyers,

02:20.009 --> 02:22.359
start on St. Lawrence
and work our way west.

02:22.403 --> 02:25.754
-[indistinct chatter]
-Let's go.

02:25.797 --> 02:27.799
[siren wailing in distance]

02:29.845 --> 02:32.326
Reeva. Hey, wait up.

02:32.369 --> 02:34.241
Hey.

02:34.284 --> 02:36.765
[groans]
What do you want?

02:36.808 --> 02:38.854
Listen, I'm sorry about
what I said in there.

02:38.897 --> 02:41.335
Look, the idea was to make
peoples' lives better.

02:41.378 --> 02:42.901
To work withthe community.

02:42.945 --> 02:45.252
Reeva, they're driving us out.

02:45.295 --> 02:46.775
Soon, we won't even have
a community,

02:46.818 --> 02:49.256
and we need a place that's ours.

02:49.299 --> 02:53.085
I shouldn't have done that.
But we're living a lie

02:53.129 --> 02:55.305
if we think that these humans
are-are ever gonna accept us...

02:57.438 --> 02:59.614
REEVA:
Come on, Benny, we should go.

03:00.745 --> 03:03.095
Hey! What do you think
you're doing?

03:03.139 --> 03:05.272
How's it your business?

03:05.315 --> 03:08.275
-It's my business
'cause it's my building.
-Give me that.

03:08.318 --> 03:09.667
You the ones that broke
the windows last week?

03:09.711 --> 03:12.496
-MAN: Maybe, mutie.
-Look, Benny,

03:12.540 --> 03:14.716
-don't. Just...
-Shut up!

03:14.759 --> 03:16.326
Don't touch her!

03:20.504 --> 03:22.289
Hey!

03:24.508 --> 03:26.641
No!

03:26.684 --> 03:29.034
Benny!

03:29.078 --> 03:30.384
No! Benny!

03:30.427 --> 03:32.299
-Come on!
-No, Benny! No, no, no!

03:32.342 --> 03:34.736
[panting]

03:34.779 --> 03:36.259
-Benny! No, no...
-[engine starts]

03:36.303 --> 03:38.914
-Benny. No, no. No, Benny, no.
-[tires screeching]

03:38.957 --> 03:42.396
No, no, no, no, please, no.
Benny, don't die on me.

03:42.439 --> 03:44.398
[crying]:
No!

03:44.441 --> 03:47.357
Benny!

03:56.584 --> 03:58.673
All right. When we get
to the Creed Financial building,

03:58.716 --> 04:01.328
we will neutralize
the mutant detection system.

04:01.371 --> 04:04.331
Once that is done, we move in.

04:04.374 --> 04:06.289
Lorna will disable
communications

04:06.333 --> 04:09.161
while the girls and I will
secure the employees.

04:09.205 --> 04:10.772
Rebecca will get us
into the vault,

04:10.815 --> 04:13.557
with Andrew by her side
for protection.

04:13.601 --> 04:16.386
We will take what we came for
and then we will leave.

04:16.430 --> 04:20.347
Violence will only be used
as a last resort.

04:20.390 --> 04:21.565
Any questions?

04:21.609 --> 04:23.785
The mutant detection system.

04:23.828 --> 04:27.092
You sure you can knock it out?

04:27.136 --> 04:30.313
If you can't, this is gonna be
a real short heist.

04:30.357 --> 04:32.141
REEVA: The girls and I are
working on that now.

04:32.184 --> 04:34.361
Everything will be ready.

04:34.404 --> 04:38.016
Get some rest.
Tomorrow is a big day.

04:49.376 --> 04:51.203
Hey, you good?

04:51.247 --> 04:54.424
Yeah. Just... the vault.

04:54.468 --> 04:56.948
The one in the training room
is completely different.

04:56.992 --> 04:58.472
I have to turn
the whole thing around...

04:58.515 --> 05:01.170
ANDY: I think you should
be fine. I mean,

05:01.213 --> 05:02.606
I saw what you did
to that cop car.

05:02.650 --> 05:04.173
That's a car.

05:04.216 --> 05:07.437
I've been turning them
inside out since I was 12.

05:07.481 --> 05:09.221
I don't know, I just don't
want to get in there

05:09.265 --> 05:12.834
and have everybody staring
at me, like, "You suck.

05:12.877 --> 05:15.706
We were all counting on you."

05:15.750 --> 05:18.230
Hey, I know you can do it.

05:18.274 --> 05:21.625
I'll be right there.

05:21.669 --> 05:24.715
I got your back.

05:24.759 --> 05:27.718
So you'll kill them all
if they make fun of me, right?

05:27.762 --> 05:29.633
-Oh, yeah, all of them.
-Yeah.

05:29.677 --> 05:33.202
-[chuckles]: They're all dead.
-Oh, good.

05:46.694 --> 05:49.218
Make sure everything
is ready for tonight.

05:49.261 --> 05:51.525
I can't be late for dinner.

05:55.442 --> 05:59.010
[shuddering]

05:59.054 --> 06:01.056
Oh, no.

06:05.103 --> 06:07.105
[grunting]

06:17.507 --> 06:18.682
You okay?

06:18.726 --> 06:21.511
-Just breathe.
-Don't touch me!

06:21.555 --> 06:23.426
I don't want to hurt you.

06:25.863 --> 06:28.562
This is ridiculous,
me being here.

06:28.605 --> 06:31.260
It's been one night
and it's already worse.

06:31.303 --> 06:32.653
I don't want to be
the reason that you two

06:32.696 --> 06:34.698
are carted off
by Sentinel Services.

06:34.742 --> 06:37.135
We need to get me to a hospital.

06:37.179 --> 06:39.703
No, they, they'd call the police
the moment they saw you.

06:39.747 --> 06:42.706
We can use a different name,
a fake I.D.

06:42.750 --> 06:45.448
Look, even if it did work, most
of the hospitals around here

06:45.492 --> 06:48.669
don't treat mutants at all,
never mind one who...

06:50.322 --> 06:52.847
...destroys everything
he touches.

06:53.848 --> 06:56.111
Look, at best,

06:56.154 --> 06:58.592
you would end up
in a prison hospital.

06:58.635 --> 07:00.594
At least then you'd be safe.

07:00.637 --> 07:05.120
If I stay here, we're all gonna
get arrested anyway.

07:05.163 --> 07:07.514
Then we'll move you.

07:07.557 --> 07:08.993
[murmurs]

07:10.168 --> 07:12.170
We are sticking together.

07:12.214 --> 07:14.390
I'm gonna go talk to the others.

07:17.959 --> 07:19.917
ECLIPSE: You seriously want to move him?

07:19.961 --> 07:21.745
In his condition?

07:21.789 --> 07:23.747
I-I don't see
that we have much choice.

07:23.791 --> 07:26.837
Finding a safe place--
wherever we move him,

07:26.881 --> 07:29.753
-he is gonna do some damage.
-ECLIPSE: Yeah, yeah.

07:29.797 --> 07:31.712
Well, why don't we just bring
him to the Morlocks?

07:31.755 --> 07:33.757
Getting him underground
might be our safest...

07:33.801 --> 07:36.543
I'm sorry, but as his human
wife, I'm not really interested

07:36.586 --> 07:38.849
in my husband joining
a mutant-only separatist group.

07:38.893 --> 07:41.635
I didn't say join. I meant
to say maybe they could help.

07:41.678 --> 07:43.637
And I said it's not an option.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.682
Okay.

07:45.726 --> 07:47.510
What about the clinic?

07:47.554 --> 07:49.773
What, the-the place that
the Purifiers just wrecked?

07:49.817 --> 07:52.428
Exactly, and it's been
shut down ever since.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.561
Nobody's gonna be
watching it now.

07:54.604 --> 07:57.781
A-A little more damage
won't raise any alarms.

07:57.825 --> 07:59.609
Look, who knows, I...

07:59.653 --> 08:01.959
I might be able to do
something for him there.

08:02.003 --> 08:06.529
Caitlin's right.
The clinic is safer than here.

08:06.573 --> 08:08.575
All right.

08:08.618 --> 08:10.577
Marcos, Clarice, and I--
we'll organize transportation.

08:10.620 --> 08:14.145
I'm gonna head on over.
Just hurry.

08:15.712 --> 08:17.148
Yeah, no, I understand
that you're her lawyer.

08:17.192 --> 08:19.934
If I could just,
if I could just talk to my wife

08:19.977 --> 08:21.979
for, like, two minutes, okay?
Just to explain...

08:22.023 --> 08:23.546
LAWYER: Mr. Turner, that's not
a good idea at this stage

08:23.590 --> 08:25.592
-in the process.
-I don't give a damn...

08:25.635 --> 08:27.637
[sighs]

08:29.160 --> 08:31.119
I'm sorry.

08:31.162 --> 08:34.122
I've known this woman
since high school, all right?

08:34.165 --> 08:36.646
We've been through
the worst nightmare

08:36.690 --> 08:39.040
that a parent can
go through, together.

08:39.083 --> 08:42.478
Just ask her
for two minutes, man, please.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.611
I'm sorry, but Ms. Turner
has instructed me

08:44.654 --> 08:46.134
not to let you speak to her.

08:46.177 --> 08:47.744
Really?

08:49.398 --> 08:51.356
I got to go.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.663
-Mr. Turner,
avoiding this step...
-[phone beeps]

08:55.709 --> 08:56.971
Hey, man.

08:57.014 --> 09:00.322
Hey, man, sorry I'm late.

09:01.845 --> 09:03.586
Why'd you want to meet up?

09:03.630 --> 09:06.067
Want to talk to you
about something. Uh...

09:06.110 --> 09:10.245
Taking down the mutie station in
Baltimore turned a lot of heads.

09:10.288 --> 09:14.641
One of our top-level supporters
wants to meet you.

09:14.684 --> 09:16.599
Tomorrow.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.383
Okay. Who is it?

09:18.427 --> 09:20.995
Meeting like this is high
security. No details in advance.

09:21.038 --> 09:22.953
-[laughs]
-And, uh,

09:22.997 --> 09:25.042
you got to get tested.

09:25.086 --> 09:27.828
For what, the X-Gene?

09:27.871 --> 09:31.179
You're serious? I was
in the Sentinel Services, man,

09:31.222 --> 09:32.180
-there's no way...
-I know.

09:32.223 --> 09:33.660
There are no exceptions.

09:33.703 --> 09:36.314
Trust me, man,
it's that important.

09:36.358 --> 09:38.839
[sighs]

09:38.882 --> 09:42.190
You know what?
Yeah, let's do it.

09:42.233 --> 09:43.800
[pats arm]

09:44.714 --> 09:47.804
[Reeva laughs]

09:47.848 --> 09:50.894
So, you're gonna
spill it or what?

09:50.938 --> 09:51.982
What?

09:52.026 --> 09:54.332
-The big secret.
-Big secret?

09:54.376 --> 09:57.118
You tell me to make sure this
dinner's not in my calendar.

09:57.161 --> 09:59.773
How did you even find
this place?

09:59.816 --> 10:01.078
I am just being careful.

10:01.122 --> 10:03.341
If the board at my company
ever knew that I was seeing

10:03.385 --> 10:05.517
one of the finance VPs
from our bank...

10:05.561 --> 10:06.780
Ah.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.782
It's important.

10:08.825 --> 10:12.481
I need to know that tonight
is just between... us.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.574
To secrets.

10:20.358 --> 10:24.145
You know, when I lost Sandy,
I... I never thought

10:24.188 --> 10:25.799
I'd find a woman that strong,

10:25.842 --> 10:29.063
that smart,
that beautiful again.

10:29.106 --> 10:30.847
Hell, I wasn't sure
I'd ever date again,

10:30.891 --> 10:35.939
with the boys and the hours
I've been putting in at work...

10:35.983 --> 10:38.638
and then I meet you.

10:42.119 --> 10:43.860
Check this out.

10:43.904 --> 10:46.297
My youngest, Kai, he drew this.

10:46.341 --> 10:47.603
[clears throat]

10:51.128 --> 10:52.608
Aw...

10:52.652 --> 10:54.392
Said for the first time
in two years,

10:54.436 --> 10:55.872
Daddy is smiling again.

11:03.967 --> 11:05.665
That's sweet.

11:07.144 --> 11:09.886
Thank you.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.373
You want to get out of here?

11:18.416 --> 11:19.722
Hell yeah, I want
to get out of here.

11:21.115 --> 11:22.464
Check, please.

11:24.031 --> 11:25.728
-Oh, really?
-[laughs]

11:25.772 --> 11:26.903
So, where'd you park?

11:26.947 --> 11:29.166
Actually, right there.

11:30.994 --> 11:33.562
-Oh, that's funny.
-What?

11:33.605 --> 11:36.217
You've never struck me
as the SUV type.

11:36.260 --> 11:38.393
-Oh, really?
-[laughs]

11:38.436 --> 11:41.657
What type did I strike you as?

11:42.963 --> 11:44.355
Nice suit, Romeo.

11:46.575 --> 11:48.795
What is this?
Who are you?

11:51.014 --> 11:52.015
I'm sorry.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.018
FROST SISTERS:
Don't worry, Quinn.

11:55.062 --> 11:56.716
You're about to make history.

12:05.637 --> 12:08.597
-Don't make me do this, I can't.
-Yes, you can, Quinn.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.773
All you need to do is go into
the bank and plug in a drive.

12:10.817 --> 12:12.906
What, to turn off the mutant
detection system?

12:12.949 --> 12:14.603
They'll know.
They'll catch me.

12:14.646 --> 12:16.779
Do not concern yourself with
that; we will take care of you.

12:18.694 --> 12:21.610
All that matters now is
that you do as you're told.

12:21.653 --> 12:23.612
And if I don't?

12:25.440 --> 12:26.746
Think of your boys.

12:29.052 --> 12:31.402
How... how can you do this?

12:33.056 --> 12:35.015
Do you know how many
anti-mutant organizations

12:35.058 --> 12:38.148
Creed Financial supports...
how many they fund?

12:38.192 --> 12:39.628
That has nothing to do with me.

12:39.671 --> 12:41.195
I don't hate mutants.

12:41.238 --> 12:44.633
I-I don't choose clients.
It's just a job.

12:44.676 --> 12:47.375
Working for a company
that hurts people.

12:47.418 --> 12:48.680
My people.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.382
I need an answer, Quinn.

12:54.425 --> 12:58.690
Okay, just...
just don't hurt my kids.

13:00.736 --> 13:01.998
They will be fine.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.918
We'll bring you a fresh suit.
We leave in an hour.

Was it all a lie?

13:13.096 --> 13:14.881

13:18.232 --> 13:20.016
I wish it was, Quinn.

13:21.713 --> 13:24.064
It would have been easier.

13:34.030 --> 13:35.989
-I need to talk to you.
-[Dawn fussing]

13:36.032 --> 13:37.904
Why? Is everything okay?

13:37.947 --> 13:40.210
It's about the job at the bank.
We need to change the plans.

13:40.254 --> 13:42.125
Uh, it's a little late
in the game for that.

13:42.169 --> 13:43.648
I don't care.

13:43.692 --> 13:46.564
I need someone to watch Dawn
while we're in there.

13:46.608 --> 13:48.958
I want you.

13:49.002 --> 13:51.004
Me? I'm supposed to be
in the bank with you.

13:51.047 --> 13:52.440
Your sisters can handle it.

13:52.483 --> 13:54.790
Look, Esme,

13:54.834 --> 13:58.098
if something happens
to me... I...

13:59.969 --> 14:02.885

anything to protect her.

Hey, how we looking in there?

14:21.164 --> 14:22.470
Uh, this thing's about
as reinforced

14:22.513 --> 14:24.428
as it can be and still roll.

14:27.605 --> 14:30.043
If you can get him in,
that should hold

14:30.086 --> 14:31.261
long enough to get him there.

14:31.305 --> 14:33.002
I don't know why I'm always
the asker of awkward questions,

14:33.046 --> 14:34.047
but then what?

14:34.090 --> 14:36.310
Is he going to live there?
What's the plan?

14:36.353 --> 14:39.356
Then we figure it out.
Caitlin's working on it.

14:39.400 --> 14:43.447
I'm gonna grab some more scrap
metal to fortify the clinic.

14:46.755 --> 14:48.800
-What?
-Nothing.

14:48.844 --> 14:50.933
Nah, there is something.

14:50.977 --> 14:54.502
What is it with you
and the Morlocks, huh?

14:54.545 --> 14:56.547
What about the Morlocks?

14:56.591 --> 14:57.984
Well, a couple of weeks ago
we didn't know they existed,

14:58.027 --> 14:59.159
and now, all of a sudden,

14:59.202 --> 15:00.769
they're the solution
to every problem?

15:00.812 --> 15:04.033
We just needed a safe place
to take Reed.

15:04.077 --> 15:05.165
Is that all, Clarice?

15:05.208 --> 15:06.949
Because Erg was practically
waiting for us

15:06.993 --> 15:08.559
when we went down there
a few days ago.

15:08.603 --> 15:10.126
What are you getting at, Marcos?

15:10.170 --> 15:13.651
I'm just asking where
your loyalties lie, that's all.

15:13.695 --> 15:16.219
Loyalties? From the guy who ran
off to moonlight

15:16.263 --> 15:19.440
with a drug cartel, with the
baby mama in the Inner Circle?

15:23.574 --> 15:25.054
I know you don't want
to admit it,

15:25.098 --> 15:26.969
but the Underground isn't
doing so well.

15:27.013 --> 15:29.841
I'd say we can use
some new allies.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.766

we're meeting this guy, huh?

15:41.810 --> 15:43.246

He likes out-of-the-way places.

15:43.290 --> 15:44.900
The day's gonna come we can have
a meeting like this

15:44.944 --> 15:45.988
out in the open.

15:46.032 --> 15:49.252
For now we got to be careful.

15:49.296 --> 15:51.037

a million times.

What...?

16:40.129 --> 16:43.915
I-I guess I didn't expect you
to be a part of all this.

16:43.959 --> 16:46.309
Well, not everyone can wear
the cross, but trust me,

16:46.353 --> 16:47.919
plenty of folks support
your efforts.

16:47.963 --> 16:50.444
What you did in Baltimore
was outstanding.

16:50.487 --> 16:52.185
The movement needs

17:01.324 --> 17:04.197
I'm just looking for justice,

ride along with me.

with you in the car.

dealing with now.

If anything happens,
I'll protect you.

acting that way.

you will go in.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.760
You will put this in the
computer in your office,

19:12.803 --> 19:14.414
and then you will wait for us.

19:14.457 --> 19:17.460

we went out?

19:17.504 --> 19:19.462

19:19.506 --> 19:21.203
I said I wanted to take you
to Athens one day,

19:21.247 --> 19:22.291
and you said, "I'd love that."

19:22.335 --> 19:24.859
-Quinn, don't do this.
-I'd still go with you.

19:24.902 --> 19:27.253
If we just walked out of here
right now...

I know you have a good heart.

19:33.650 --> 19:36.610
Why do you think I'm doing this?
To expose the guilty.

19:36.653 --> 19:38.699

without my help.

to the studio today.

24:02.745 --> 24:05.487
Look, man, I'm sorry,

24:05.531 --> 24:07.881
I'm... I'm just not that guy.

24:17.194 --> 24:20.328
PHOEBE: Everybody form a line
against the wall.

24:20.371 --> 24:22.156
Nice and easy, everyone.

24:23.810 --> 24:25.115
Against the wall.

24:25.159 --> 24:27.378
Everyone stay calm.

24:27.422 --> 24:29.729
Cooperate, and you will
walk out of here alive.

24:29.772 --> 24:31.165
[Marnie sobs]

24:31.208 --> 24:33.776
Hey. Marnie, Marnie, Marnie.

24:33.820 --> 24:35.430
It's all right.

24:35.474 --> 24:38.868
I don't know what you think
you're going to accomplish here.

24:38.912 --> 24:40.914
-James, just stop.
-No!

24:40.957 --> 24:43.177
They need to know.

24:43.220 --> 24:45.135
Our vault's made of adamantium.

24:45.179 --> 24:47.442
It's unbreakable, and the only
people with the combinations

24:47.486 --> 24:49.575
are two states away.

24:49.618 --> 24:52.752
If you're smart,
you'll just let us go.

24:52.795 --> 24:55.145
Oh, we'll let you go,

24:55.189 --> 24:58.453
but first you'll do
something for me.

24:58.497 --> 25:01.151
You will tell the world

25:01.195 --> 25:05.242
how this bank was built off
of the suffering of my people.

25:05.286 --> 25:07.723
[scoffs]
If you think I'll cooperate

25:07.767 --> 25:09.464
with mutant terrorists...

25:09.508 --> 25:10.770
Think you will?

25:13.816 --> 25:16.602
We know you will.

25:19.866 --> 25:24.131
By the time you see this,
Creed Financial will be gone.

25:24.174 --> 25:26.394
For years,
we've backed companies

25:26.437 --> 25:28.657
that persecute mutants
worldwide.

25:28.701 --> 25:31.486
Bankrupted mutant-owned
businesses.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.357
Crippled their investments.

25:33.401 --> 25:36.143
Wait, hold up, are we really
gonna let the workers go?

25:36.186 --> 25:37.710
-As opposed to what?
-I don't know.

25:37.753 --> 25:39.581
I mean, they did
all this crap to mutants

25:39.625 --> 25:41.061
and then they just
get to go home?

25:41.104 --> 25:42.671
I mean, seriously,
they're humans.

25:42.715 --> 25:45.848
-Hey, my mom's a human.
-Whatever, so was mine.

25:45.892 --> 25:47.458
It's not like
she works here, Andy.

25:47.502 --> 25:50.070
Rebecca, can we just
stick to the plan?

25:50.113 --> 25:51.985
The deal is, we get
what we came for and go.

25:52.028 --> 25:54.901
-Understand?
-Okay, fine. I was just asking.

26:07.435 --> 26:09.437
[grunts]

26:34.810 --> 26:35.768
You okay?

26:35.811 --> 26:38.858
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

26:38.901 --> 26:41.208
Okay, brother, unfortunately,
I've known you long enough

26:41.251 --> 26:42.731
to know when
you're spinning out,

26:42.775 --> 26:46.300
so... cough up.

26:49.172 --> 26:51.131
I was just, um,

26:51.174 --> 26:52.872
thinking about the patient

26:52.915 --> 26:56.136
that Caitlin and I lost here
when Purifiers attacked.

26:57.572 --> 27:02.055
He was a soldier and, uh...
and I tried to help him.

27:02.098 --> 27:03.796
You did everything you could.

27:03.839 --> 27:07.538
-Did I?
-Yes.

27:07.582 --> 27:09.932
Marcos, we've lost so much.

27:09.976 --> 27:13.066
Shatter died 50 feet away
from me. I couldn't help him.

27:13.109 --> 27:15.938
Okay, no, you were gassed, man,
you couldn't even walk.

27:15.982 --> 27:19.463
Everything we have
worked for is dying.

27:19.507 --> 27:21.552
I called every station

27:21.596 --> 27:24.686
a hundred miles from here to see
if they could help with Reed.

27:24.730 --> 27:25.948
Nothing.

27:25.992 --> 27:27.733
You know what they talk about?

27:27.776 --> 27:30.779
Mutant Uprising.

27:30.823 --> 27:32.912
The Inner Circle's beating us
at our own game

27:32.955 --> 27:35.001
and people are losing faith.

27:38.961 --> 27:40.920
Since we're talking about it,

27:40.963 --> 27:43.313
it's not just their loyalties
I'm worried about.

27:43.357 --> 27:44.837
What are you talking about?

27:44.880 --> 27:48.971
I know you care about Clarice.
We all do.

27:49.015 --> 27:52.627
But I think that you
should talk to her.

27:52.671 --> 27:55.412
The Morlocks? Erg?

27:55.456 --> 27:57.110
You can't say
you've never considered

27:57.153 --> 27:58.981
that she's thought about it,
about what they're doing.

27:59.025 --> 28:00.591
Hey, hey!
She has fought alongside us

28:00.635 --> 28:01.854
since the beginning.

28:01.897 --> 28:03.769
-I get that...
-You better have some proof.

28:03.812 --> 28:06.597
John, I'm just telling you, man.
Pay attention.

28:06.641 --> 28:08.991
I was down there.

28:09.035 --> 28:12.560
I saw something between them.
Just... just ask.

28:12.603 --> 28:15.171
That's it.

28:15.955 --> 28:17.565
Hey.

28:21.612 --> 28:22.788
Be careful. Don't get too close.

28:25.051 --> 28:28.750
Come on. Get some rest.

28:47.813 --> 28:49.640
Ooh, look at that.

28:49.684 --> 28:52.818
Yeah, the plans were right.

28:52.861 --> 28:56.822
It's 15 feet back,
mounted into solid bedrock.

28:56.865 --> 28:58.780
Open at the back.

28:58.824 --> 29:00.651
You're up, kid.

29:03.045 --> 29:04.220
You got this.

29:06.266 --> 29:08.834
Okay.

29:12.533 --> 29:14.535
[grunting]

29:20.062 --> 29:21.629
God, it is so strong.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.763
But I-I think
I can turn it around.

29:31.073 --> 29:33.032
[straining]

29:36.992 --> 29:39.865
[grunts]
It's too much.

29:39.908 --> 29:42.476
Hey.

29:42.519 --> 29:45.522
You remember what it was like
in that hospital?

29:45.566 --> 29:47.089
How angry you were?

29:47.133 --> 29:48.917
How alone?

29:48.961 --> 29:50.919
How afraid?

29:50.963 --> 29:52.051
You have to channel that.

29:53.052 --> 29:57.056
Just picture what it felt like.
Use it.

29:59.928 --> 30:00.929
[screaming]

30:07.893 --> 30:09.764
[screaming]

30:26.912 --> 30:30.002
[screams]

30:43.754 --> 30:45.713
-I did it.
-Hey.

30:45.756 --> 30:48.759
[laughs]

30:48.803 --> 30:50.196
We got work to do.

30:57.203 --> 30:59.118
What the hell was that in there?

30:59.161 --> 31:02.034
I don't know what to tell you,
man, it's not my thing.

31:02.077 --> 31:04.688
I don't think you understand
what you just passed up.

31:04.732 --> 31:05.689
A chance to make real change.

31:05.733 --> 31:06.908
What, by selling out my friends?

31:06.952 --> 31:07.909
Friends?

31:07.953 --> 31:13.045
Did they stand up for you
after Atlanta? Did they?

31:13.088 --> 31:15.003
We're your friends now, man.
You know it's true.

31:15.047 --> 31:16.570
You lost your daughter.
You lost your wife...

31:16.613 --> 31:18.137
Hey, hey, don-don't talk
about my family, man!

31:18.180 --> 31:21.140
Here's the reality:
we're all you got.

31:21.183 --> 31:23.533
You want to show your wife
you're not just some broken-down

31:23.577 --> 31:25.144
ex-agent living in the past?

31:26.232 --> 31:28.321
Change the future.

31:35.197 --> 31:37.112
Where are you taking me?

31:37.156 --> 31:39.723
-What are we doing?
-You're gonna get us
into the accounts.

31:39.767 --> 31:42.813
[sighs]

31:42.857 --> 31:45.904
The scanner, Quinn.

31:57.480 --> 31:59.830
You know what that means, right?

31:59.874 --> 32:01.354
People lose everything.

32:01.397 --> 32:04.792
Businesses. Homes.
Innocent people.

32:04.835 --> 32:06.141
Tell that to the mutants
who died

32:06.185 --> 32:08.013
so this place
could turn a profit.

32:10.015 --> 32:14.106
Quinn, this is almost over.

32:14.149 --> 32:16.369
Be smart and you will
get through this.

32:22.244 --> 32:25.030
Ah, the guest of honor.

32:29.208 --> 32:31.645
Time to log in.

32:34.822 --> 32:37.085
Let the world remember today.

32:37.129 --> 32:39.653
We are the ones
who used our wealth

32:39.696 --> 32:43.265
and power to enable the torture
of innocent mutants.

32:43.309 --> 32:45.485
We are the criminals...

32:51.447 --> 32:54.363
The time for the Mutant Uprising
has come.

32:54.407 --> 32:57.149
The time for justice.

32:57.192 --> 32:58.411
[grunts]

32:58.454 --> 33:00.239
Nice job.

33:00.282 --> 33:01.414
You're a natural.

33:01.457 --> 33:03.503
You people are monsters.

33:03.546 --> 33:08.290
Oh. According to the video
you just made, we're heroes.

33:08.334 --> 33:10.292
PHOEBE AND SOPHIE:
It's been fun, everybody,

33:10.336 --> 33:14.340
but it's quiet time now. Shh.

33:24.176 --> 33:26.091
[shushes]

33:26.134 --> 33:28.093
It's okay, sweetie.

33:28.136 --> 33:29.964
I couldmake you stop crying,

33:30.008 --> 33:33.098
but Auntie Esme is not allowed
in your mind anymore,

33:33.141 --> 33:36.188
is she? No, she isn't. No.

33:39.495 --> 33:41.932
-They're in.
-Shh!

33:43.325 --> 33:45.849
[quietly]:
Something's coming through.

33:45.893 --> 33:48.026
What is it?

33:51.116 --> 33:54.075
It's everything.

33:54.119 --> 33:57.078
[laughs]

33:57.122 --> 34:00.951
It's your first bank heist.

34:00.995 --> 34:03.215
LAUREN: Any luck
with Otto's old papers?

34:03.258 --> 34:04.694
Maybe.

34:04.738 --> 34:07.219
Most of his later research was
overseen by his lab assistant.

34:07.262 --> 34:09.351
Yeah. Dad told me about her.

34:09.395 --> 34:12.311
He already looked. Couldn't find
anything on a Madeline Risman.

34:12.354 --> 34:16.228
No, but there is
a Professor Madeline Garber

34:16.271 --> 34:17.968
at Charlotte State University.

34:18.012 --> 34:20.754
She's the same age,
a geneticist.

34:20.797 --> 34:22.321
I think it's her.

34:22.364 --> 34:23.278
[sighs]

34:23.322 --> 34:26.281
-[grunts]
-Lauren.

34:32.853 --> 34:34.811
I think he's okay.

34:39.773 --> 34:42.732
The last six months, he has been
suffering right in front of me,

34:42.776 --> 34:44.517
but I was too focused
on everything else...

34:44.560 --> 34:46.084
That's not your fault.

34:47.346 --> 34:49.609
He kept that from you
to protect you.

34:49.652 --> 34:51.437
I don't need protecting.

34:55.441 --> 35:00.272
Maybe our family is cursed.

35:00.315 --> 35:01.838
Look at Dad.

35:03.449 --> 35:05.277
What if we're never able

35:05.320 --> 35:08.106
to touch him again?

35:09.324 --> 35:11.283
I mean, think of everything

35:11.326 --> 35:14.721
Andrea and Andreas von Strucker
did as Fenris...

35:14.764 --> 35:17.289
The von Strucker twins
were murderers.

35:17.332 --> 35:19.769
They chose
who they wanted to be.

35:19.813 --> 35:22.424
-That-That has nothing
to do with you.
-Nothing?

35:24.296 --> 35:27.734
When Andy and I used our powers
together in Atlanta,

35:27.777 --> 35:31.477
I knew that people were dying.

35:32.826 --> 35:34.871
But I felt free.

35:34.915 --> 35:38.092
I felt powerful.

35:38.136 --> 35:41.182
'Cause you were saving
all of us.

35:43.053 --> 35:46.100
You were doing the opposite
of what the von Struckers did.

35:46.144 --> 35:50.017
I really hope so.

35:52.715 --> 35:55.501
[gasps, clears throat]

35:56.589 --> 35:57.764
[coughs]

35:57.807 --> 35:59.287
[panting]

36:01.594 --> 36:04.249
Hey.

36:04.292 --> 36:05.293
Are you all right?

36:09.732 --> 36:12.909
I think the attack's passed.

36:12.953 --> 36:14.868
The pain's not so bad.

36:14.911 --> 36:17.392
I... Have some water.

36:17.436 --> 36:19.264
LAUREN:
Mom.

36:22.310 --> 36:24.312
Okay.

36:28.882 --> 36:31.319
I have something to show you.

36:34.496 --> 36:37.369
I think maybe we should stock
this place with food and water.

36:37.412 --> 36:39.109
Reed could be here a while.

36:39.153 --> 36:41.242
Okay. I'm all for making it
comfortable,

36:41.286 --> 36:43.723
but how long can
we really keep this up?

36:43.766 --> 36:45.812
Caitlin said she's on it.

36:45.855 --> 36:47.379
We're just buying her some time.

36:49.207 --> 36:52.384
I'll, uh, I'll unload
the rest of the metal.

36:56.083 --> 36:57.911
So what's going on?

36:57.954 --> 36:59.869
Something you want to tell me?

36:59.913 --> 37:02.394
I was gonna ask you the same.

37:02.437 --> 37:05.527
It's funny how that question
keeps coming up.

37:05.571 --> 37:08.443
Look, I don't want to fight,

37:08.487 --> 37:12.969
but is there anything I should
know about the Morlocks?

37:13.013 --> 37:14.667
You and Erg?

37:17.235 --> 37:20.716
Hey, Clarice? I'm just asking.

37:20.760 --> 37:22.501
All right? What we're doing here
does not work

37:22.544 --> 37:24.372
if we're not honest
with each other.

37:24.416 --> 37:27.201
Well, what the hell
arewe doing here, John?

37:27.245 --> 37:28.855
We being honest about that?

37:28.898 --> 37:30.509
Are we saving people?

37:30.552 --> 37:32.337
Fighting the Inner Circle?
Stopping racists?

37:32.380 --> 37:34.774
I mean, do we even have
a plan past tomorrow?

37:34.817 --> 37:36.863
No! Th-That's not
what this is about.

37:36.906 --> 37:39.344
-Well, it should be!
-Tell me the truth!

37:39.387 --> 37:41.694
Is there anything
I should know about Erg?

37:41.737 --> 37:44.436
Yes, okay? Yes, there is.

37:44.479 --> 37:47.177
I helped him steal some food.

37:47.221 --> 37:48.918
I told him about
some of the mutants

37:48.962 --> 37:51.138
that passed
through the Underground.

37:51.181 --> 37:54.141
You gave Erg information?

37:54.184 --> 37:56.491
You stole for him?
Without telling me? Why?

37:56.535 --> 37:58.711
Because he's actually
helping mutants.

37:58.754 --> 38:00.887
A hell of a lot better than we
are these days, don't you think?

38:00.930 --> 38:03.803
-I can't believe you.
-Because you will never get it.

38:03.846 --> 38:06.762
-Oh.
-Down there, you don't have
to hide who you are,

38:06.806 --> 38:09.025
-you don't have to run.
-So that's your excuse
to lie to me?

38:09.069 --> 38:11.593
It's not an excuse.

38:11.637 --> 38:14.379
I did it for you.

38:14.422 --> 38:16.032
-[chuckles]: Okay.
-I did it for all of us.

38:16.076 --> 38:19.166
You don't think I see
how this affects you?

38:19.209 --> 38:23.475
Losing Atlanta? The Inner Circle
kicking our asses?

38:23.518 --> 38:25.781
You were falling apart.

38:25.825 --> 38:29.394
You needed help, and it was
the only way to get it.

38:31.439 --> 38:35.225
I'm sorry if you don't
see it that way.

38:45.235 --> 38:47.194
I appreciate you
doing all of this.

38:47.237 --> 38:49.588
-And it looks promising, but...
-Promising?

38:49.631 --> 38:53.461
Reed, sh-she's the head of
a whole research institute now.

38:53.505 --> 38:55.637
Even if it is the same Madeline,

38:55.681 --> 38:58.292
-we don't know
anything about her.
-We know enough.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.294
She may be the only person alive

39:00.338 --> 39:02.949
who knows anything
about your condition.

39:02.992 --> 39:05.517
Not only that, but she knows
about our family.

39:05.560 --> 39:08.607
I could barely make it
across the city today.

39:08.650 --> 39:12.306
Her research institute is in
Charlotte. It's hours away.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.482
-We can take the ambulance.
-It's too risky.

39:14.526 --> 39:17.442
CAITLIN:
Reed, you said it yourself.

39:17.485 --> 39:19.444
You're getting worse.

39:19.487 --> 39:22.229
The real risk is doing nothing.

39:31.151 --> 39:32.457
Hey.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.502
[winces]

39:44.730 --> 39:46.471
[laughs softly, sniffles]

39:50.257 --> 39:51.737
All right.

39:54.740 --> 39:56.698
REEVA:
Yes, everything went perfectly.

39:56.742 --> 39:57.917
We're finishing up
at the computer

39:57.960 --> 39:59.571
while the others prepare
for our exit.

39:59.614 --> 40:00.833
How are things on your end?

40:00.876 --> 40:02.487
Better than we'd hoped.

40:02.530 --> 40:04.010
We just put the video out,

40:04.053 --> 40:05.925
we've drained over
a hundred million dollars

40:05.968 --> 40:08.057
in account balances so far,

40:08.101 --> 40:11.452
and I got the baby to sleep.
Not a bad day's work.

40:11.496 --> 40:14.194
I'll see you soon.

40:16.065 --> 40:18.416
We're done here.

40:21.549 --> 40:24.900
So what happens now?

40:24.944 --> 40:26.467
To me?

40:26.511 --> 40:29.252
To everyone upstairs?

40:29.296 --> 40:32.734
-You made a promise.
-A promise I'm going to keep.

40:32.778 --> 40:34.475
You will return to the office
and wait with the others.

40:34.519 --> 40:37.609
The police will be
arriving shortly.

40:37.652 --> 40:39.741
I know it's cold comfort,

40:39.785 --> 40:43.963
but someday you will be a hero
to a nation of mutants.

40:44.006 --> 40:46.705
[elevator doors open]

40:49.447 --> 40:52.101
I never even knew
your real name, did I?

40:52.145 --> 40:54.277
Soon you will.

40:54.321 --> 40:56.584
Soon the whole world
will know my name.

40:59.413 --> 41:01.546
RYAN:
I am glad you changed your mind.

41:01.589 --> 41:03.722
Thank you so much for coming.

41:03.765 --> 41:05.767
Thank Ted.
He talked some sense into me.

41:05.811 --> 41:07.334
I just told you the truth.

41:07.377 --> 41:09.118
We're hoping to get you
on the air soon.

41:09.162 --> 41:10.555
We'll do some pre-interviews,
craft the message

41:10.598 --> 41:12.208
-a little bit...
-Okay, yeah, look,

41:12.252 --> 41:13.949
I'll-I'll say
what I think is wrong

41:13.993 --> 41:15.908
about how
Sentinel Services is run,

41:15.951 --> 41:17.562
but I'm not going
after anybody by name.

41:17.605 --> 41:20.565
No need. We're taking on
the system here.

41:20.608 --> 41:21.522
We're gonna wake people up.

41:21.566 --> 41:23.306
And show them
that the only way to deal

41:23.350 --> 41:25.004
with the mutant threat
is to follow your example

41:25.047 --> 41:26.571
and start taking matters
into their own hands.

41:26.614 --> 41:29.661
-MAN: Mr. Ryan.
-Just one sec.

41:29.704 --> 41:30.662
Sorry, sir, it's important.

41:30.705 --> 41:32.925
Something's happened. An attack.

41:36.494 --> 41:39.235
Oh, my God.

41:39.279 --> 41:40.759
Trust me, Mr. Turner.

41:40.802 --> 41:42.500
Now, more than ever,
we need you.

41:49.376 --> 41:50.595
What's our status?

41:50.638 --> 41:52.597
We're getting police response.

41:52.640 --> 41:54.686
-Time?
-Two minutes.

42:00.735 --> 42:03.695
All of you deserve to be wiped
from the face of the Earth.

42:03.738 --> 42:07.742
You're terrorists, all of you.
You'll all burn for this.

42:07.786 --> 42:10.049
I hope you rot in hell.

42:13.748 --> 42:16.534
You'll pay for this,
all of you.

42:17.622 --> 42:19.754
-Time to go.
-Wait a second.

42:19.798 --> 42:21.234
We're just gonna let that go?

42:21.277 --> 42:22.496
Rebecca, we have to leave.

42:22.540 --> 42:24.367
I'm being serious.

42:24.411 --> 42:25.934
You know, the whole reason
we are here

42:25.978 --> 42:28.241
is because these people
are hurting mutants,

42:28.284 --> 42:29.764
and now we're just like,
whatever?

42:29.808 --> 42:31.810
The plan is,
we walk out of here.

42:31.853 --> 42:34.856
Rebecca, we are done here.

42:37.859 --> 42:39.557
Screw the plan.

42:41.863 --> 42:43.473

42:43.517 --> 42:46.607

No, no, no, no, no, no...

-No! No! No!

42:52.700 --> 42:54.659
No, don't!

We have to go. Now. Now!
