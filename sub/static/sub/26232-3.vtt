Hi.

01:25.377 --> 01:26.712
-Yes?
-Yes.

01:26.795 --> 01:28.255
Hi. I saw your sign.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.465
Yeah. My son put that up.

01:31.383 --> 01:32.926
Oh. Can I talk to him?

01:33.594 --> 01:34.720
I'd rather you didn't.

01:35.512 --> 01:36.346
Okay.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.724
The room. Can I see it?

01:38.807 --> 01:39.933
It's in the basement.

01:41.059 --> 01:43.061
[dog barking]

01:43.312 --> 01:44.146
Can I see it?

01:44.438 --> 01:45.272
What's to see?

01:45.606 --> 01:47.691
Four walls and a bed. You want it or not?

01:48.692 --> 01:51.653
-Is there a bathroom?
-Of course there's a bathroom.

01:52.070 --> 01:53.614
In fact it's "the" bathroom.

01:54.197 --> 01:55.282
"The" bathroom?

01:55.741 --> 01:57.909
-So, it's only the bathroom.
-That's right.

01:58.327 --> 01:59.494
And the door is broken.

01:59.911 --> 02:01.830
So I guess we'll be seeing
a lot of each other.

02:09.087 --> 02:10.005
Who was that?

02:10.756 --> 02:12.049
Some kid about the room.

02:12.257 --> 02:13.675
[bottles jingle]

02:13.759 --> 02:14.843
He wasn't interested?

02:15.510 --> 02:16.970
He said he'd think about it.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.182
-What did you say to him?
-You scared him away, didn't you?

02:20.349 --> 02:22.601
I don't want some stranger
living in my house.

02:22.726 --> 02:25.937
-Bad enough living with Nancy Drew.
-We've got to do something.

02:26.063 --> 02:28.065
Overdue, second notice, third notice...

02:28.523 --> 02:29.816
Third notice. [chuckles]

02:30.317 --> 02:31.485
Hope springs eternal.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.528
We wouldn't be in this hole
if it wasn't for you.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.906
I talked to my friend
at Gamblers Anonymous.

02:35.989 --> 02:39.159
Hey! I do not have a gambling problem.

02:39.576 --> 02:42.287
I have a problem
with the New York Giants' offensive line.

02:42.371 --> 02:44.039
-Did you see that game?
-No, I did not.

02:44.122 --> 02:46.750
I was what they call working. Con Ed.

02:47.542 --> 02:48.377
Final Notice.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.712
Here, come on, give it to me.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.547
-They're going to cut us off.
-Give it to me.

02:52.631 --> 02:54.216
I'll take care of it. I've got a plan.

02:54.299 --> 02:57.302
What do you mean? There's no plan.
Just pay the damn bill.

02:59.221 --> 03:00.055
Caruso.

03:01.390 --> 03:02.224
Just the one?

03:04.184 --> 03:05.060
Was he alone?

03:06.228 --> 03:07.688
[takes deep breath]

03:07.813 --> 03:08.689
Okay,

03:09.022 --> 03:11.108
Loomis and Detective Vasquez
will meet on site.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.402
I'll be in the squad room.
I'll coordinate from there.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.738
Maguire Correctional.
Someone's over the wall.

03:16.822 --> 03:17.698
Really?

03:18.156 --> 03:19.116
Anybody I know?

03:19.658 --> 03:20.951
I would not be surprised.

03:21.785 --> 03:22.744
Hey...

03:23.495 --> 03:24.329
Wear your vest.

03:25.622 --> 03:26.456
Son...

03:27.165 --> 03:27.999
Love you.

03:29.418 --> 03:30.419

[Cora] Alright, let's go, people.
Every minute counts.

03:58.780 --> 03:59.906
I see some houses up there.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.616
-Have they've been notified?
-Yes, ma'am.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.535
Alright, we need to set up a checkpoint

04:03.618 --> 04:05.871
at the Triborough,
and another 15 miles south.

04:06.496 --> 04:09.166
If a car has been stolen
within 30 miles of here,

04:09.249 --> 04:10.083
I want to know.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.169

04:16.089 --> 04:17.132

04:18.508 --> 04:19.342
<i>It looks cold.</i>

04:20.802 --> 04:22.345
<i>How cold would you say it is?</i>

04:23.638 --> 04:24.556
One degree?

04:27.100 --> 04:28.101
Detective?

04:29.060 --> 04:30.061
He killed somebody.

[Cora clears throat]

04:58.215 --> 05:00.759
I'm Detective Vasquez,
this is Sergeant Loomis.

05:01.092 --> 05:04.304
Sergeant Wickes.
We're stationed out of Hempstead.

05:04.387 --> 05:08.058
We caught the call about 40 minutes ago.
We're in the city limits,

05:08.141 --> 05:10.310
so technically, this is your show,

05:10.393 --> 05:11.436
which is fine by me.

05:11.603 --> 05:15.065
That's Mick Quinlan.
He and his wife were renting the place.

05:15.649 --> 05:16.817
He's an astronomy buff.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.736
They come up on the weekends
to do some star-gazing.

05:20.612 --> 05:22.781
The wife was cold when we arrived.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.908
-Can he talk?
-He's still in shock.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.077
I talked to him for a minute.

05:27.202 --> 05:29.538
He said the guy burst in around 1:15.

05:29.955 --> 05:30.956
That tracks.

05:31.498 --> 05:34.835
The prison logged the escape at 1:05.
We're half a mile from there.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.920
He said the guy wanted their car keys.

05:37.212 --> 05:40.298
They couldn't find them fast enough,
so he exploded.

05:41.091 --> 05:43.760
The husband fought back as best he could.

05:43.844 --> 05:44.678
Good for him.

05:51.226 --> 05:52.060
Mr. Quinlan.

05:52.811 --> 05:53.645
Sir?

05:54.688 --> 05:55.939
I'm Detective Loomis.

05:57.607 --> 05:59.276
Is this the man who attacked you?

06:03.822 --> 06:05.198
[sobs] I couldn't stop him.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.638
-[Tony Sr.]You see that guy?
-[music playing]

06:28.847 --> 06:29.848
The guy over there.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.602
I've got shoes just like that at home.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.564
You've got the shoes
just like that at home.

06:39.774 --> 06:41.234
[laughs] It's official Gordy...

06:41.860 --> 06:43.486
we've run out of conversation.

06:46.364 --> 06:47.657
Did you hear about that?

06:48.325 --> 06:49.951
He crawled through a sewer.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.245
Yeah, I was there when my son
got the call.

06:53.997 --> 06:54.956
[Tony Sr.]Â Sherm?

06:55.498 --> 06:58.793
-[Gordy] You know that guy?
-Yeah, Sherman Smalls. [laughs]

06:59.085 --> 07:00.545
I was inside with him.

07:01.212 --> 07:03.089
First week I was there,
he saved my ass.

07:03.632 --> 07:04.925
He saved your life?

07:05.133 --> 07:06.426
That's not what I said.

07:06.718 --> 07:07.719
He was a boxer.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.137
A heavyweight.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.055
Any good?

07:10.138 --> 07:10.972
No.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.974
Nine pro fights.
Never saw the seventh round.

07:13.183 --> 07:14.142
What was he in for?

07:14.768 --> 07:15.977
He got in a bar fight.

07:16.186 --> 07:17.270
Protecting some girl.

07:17.354 --> 07:20.899
The guy died. Sherm's a boxer,
so they called it manslaughter.

07:22.317 --> 07:25.070
How the hell could Sherman Smalls
break out of jail.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.488
I mean, the guy's a pussycat.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.240
Your pussycat killed a woman.

07:30.408 --> 07:32.285
She was in a cabin about a mile away.

07:33.578 --> 07:34.412

[music playing]

07:49.177 --> 07:50.011
Hello.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.304
Who's there?

07:54.975 --> 07:56.226
Hey, Tony.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.478
Sherman.

07:58.895 --> 08:00.188
What are you doing here?

08:00.271 --> 08:01.690
You told me I should come
by when I got out.

08:01.773 --> 08:03.358
Yeah, when you got out.

08:04.275 --> 08:05.276
Oh, I got out.

08:05.568 --> 08:06.903
I didn't mean escape.

08:07.112 --> 08:09.197
When you got out, when you were released.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.241
Sherm, you can't be here.

08:11.366 --> 08:14.953
-I can't be seen with you, man.
-Okay. Sorry, Tony.

08:17.622 --> 08:18.623
Where should I go?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.292
I don't know, Sherm.

08:22.419 --> 08:25.672
You just tell me where I should go
and what I should do when I get there.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.133
You're a good guy, Tony.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.010
I'll do whatever you say.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.890
-[Tony Sr. cooking]
-Where's your boy?

08:36.641 --> 08:37.767
He's working late.

08:38.143 --> 08:39.227
Looking for you.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.396
He's a smart boy. He'll find me.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.398
Shouldn't be too hard.
You're in his kitchen.

08:44.315 --> 08:45.191
What's all this?

08:45.817 --> 08:46.735
It's bisque.

08:47.736 --> 08:48.862
Tomato bisque.

08:49.696 --> 08:52.365
-Do you have regular tomato?
-No Sherm, that's all we have.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.283
Just eat it.

08:53.658 --> 08:56.077
Regular tomato.
So, what were you thinking?

08:56.411 --> 08:58.371
You have less than a year left, right?

08:58.496 --> 09:01.374
Brooke, my daughter,
she never came to visit.

09:01.708 --> 09:02.917
But I've got to see her.

09:03.001 --> 09:06.046
She's starting to box now.
She's got her first fight on Saturday.

09:06.212 --> 09:09.758
You're not going to see her box, Sherm.
That's not going to happen.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.760
You've got to lawyer up
and turn yourself in.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.512
And no public defender this time.
This is serious.

09:15.013 --> 09:16.181
Because I escaped?

09:17.932 --> 09:19.392
Because of the murder.

09:20.101 --> 09:22.145
The woman you attacked. She's dead.

09:24.689 --> 09:25.523
What woman?

09:25.940 --> 09:29.110
<i>A gruesome scene here</i>

-Tony, I swear.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.922
I swear on my daughter's eyes.

09:49.005 --> 09:49.839
That wasn't me.

I escaped, I did that. But not...

that.

09:53.510 --> 09:57.180
[sighs] Come on, Sherman.
They were half a mile from the prison.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.808
It happened 15 minutes
after you broke out.

09:59.891 --> 10:02.060
The husband survived. He saw you.

10:02.185 --> 10:03.228

You know, you got banged up pretty good...

10:12.987 --> 10:15.156
and you blackout. I've seen you black out.

10:15.240 --> 10:18.243
I used to wait for you to black out,
so I could steal your carrot cake.

10:18.827 --> 10:19.661

I would remember this.

I can't find the keys.

10:46.104 --> 10:47.105

all... over me. [cries]

10:55.613 --> 10:58.700
You can't blame yourself, Mick.
You did everything you could.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.119
She was my life.

11:04.122 --> 11:06.833
Sherm, I want to believe you.
I'm trying hard to believe you.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.001
Believe me.

11:08.084 --> 11:09.544
It's not that easy.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.254
Alright, wait a minute.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.923
-Did you escape with anybody else?
-No.

11:14.215 --> 11:16.634

-No.

11:23.725 --> 11:25.852
I... don't know, but...

11:26.311 --> 11:27.770
there's got to be an answer.

11:27.854 --> 11:31.191
You could figure it out Tony.
You were a cop. You were a detective.

11:31.399 --> 11:34.527
Come on, Sherm, it's a long time,
it was a lifetime ago.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.366
[starts crying]

11:41.492 --> 11:43.786
Alright. No, no come...

12:09.103 --> 12:11.105
[activates car alarm]

12:21.741 --> 12:23.743
[breathes heavily]

12:29.249 --> 12:30.083
[sighs]

12:30.166 --> 12:32.210
<i>And that is when I heard the gunshots...</i>

12:33.211 --> 12:35.213
[TV continues playing]

12:35.964 --> 12:36.839
[Tony Sr.] Yo.

12:37.298 --> 12:38.258
You still up?

12:38.341 --> 12:41.386
Yeah, I got sucked in.
Couldn't turn it off.

12:42.011 --> 12:43.221
[Tony Jr.] <i>Law & Order?</i>

12:43.513 --> 12:45.556
Yeah, it's confusing.

12:45.848 --> 12:47.475
You never know who to root for.

12:49.018 --> 12:49.852
Long day?

12:49.978 --> 12:52.063
[groans] Make sure I don't sleep too late.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.857
I've got to meet the CSI team
at the cabin tomorrow in...

12:55.400 --> 12:57.402
[takes deep breath] three hours.

12:57.568 --> 12:59.904
Any leads? Anybody seen him?

13:00.071 --> 13:02.031
Everybody seen him, that's the problem.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.867
Ryan made a website
that's been crashing all night.

13:05.827 --> 13:06.744
I read the jacket.

13:07.745 --> 13:11.457
You were Upstate with this guy.
Sherman Smalls. Big guy, big beard...

13:11.541 --> 13:12.917
-Remember him?
-Sherman, yeah.

13:13.084 --> 13:17.130
Yeah... I used to see him around the yard.
I didn't know him that well...

13:17.213 --> 13:19.757
just, "How you doing?"
You know, lucky shiv...

13:19.841 --> 13:20.925
that kind of thing.

13:21.426 --> 13:23.594
By the way, I... I rented the basement.

13:24.053 --> 13:26.097
I decided you were right...
We could use the money.

13:26.180 --> 13:27.015
To who?

13:27.098 --> 13:28.308
A friend of Wendell's.

13:29.100 --> 13:29.934
Anyone I know?

13:30.184 --> 13:33.563
No... And let me tell you,
this is a perfect situation.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.398
You won't even know anyone's there.

13:35.565 --> 13:38.901
This is a very private individual,
a recluse almost.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.529
A very shy person.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.781
You probably won't even
meet each other.

13:45.616 --> 13:47.368
This is a shy person,

13:47.452 --> 13:49.996
who wants to stay downstairs.

13:50.371 --> 13:52.540
-[heavy footsteps]
-[door opens and creaks]

13:54.709 --> 13:55.543
Hello.

13:56.794 --> 13:57.712
Oh, good.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.005
You came upstairs.

13:59.255 --> 14:02.759
You can meet me my son, Tony Junior,
the police lieutenant.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.719
Anthony, this is...

14:05.553 --> 14:07.263
-This is...
-Elke.

14:07.430 --> 14:10.433
Elkie... yes, exac-- She's from Germany.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.685
-Isn't that interesting?
-Germany, really?

14:12.935 --> 14:15.938
Yeah, well... Tony, Jr. is tired.
He's been working all night.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.899
We're going to let him sleep.
Come on.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.734
I can't seem to find my glasses,

14:19.817 --> 14:20.651
but...

14:21.402 --> 14:23.946
Elke from Germany, very nice to meet you.

14:24.113 --> 14:27.533
Welcome to our home.
Is there anything else you need?

14:27.617 --> 14:29.869
She doesn't understand
a word you're saying.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.330
Where in Germany are you from?

14:32.497 --> 14:34.499
[Sherman speaking German language]

14:37.293 --> 14:39.420
Sorry, I can't understand
what you're saying.

14:39.504 --> 14:41.589
Of course you don't.
She's from Germany. No wonder.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.675
Okay, let's call it a night.
I know we're all tired.

14:47.095 --> 14:48.471
Dad, I think she's hungry.

14:48.805 --> 14:51.307
We've spoken about this.
The kitchen is closed.

14:51.474 --> 14:52.767
Kitchen <i>verboten.</i>

14:52.850 --> 14:54.602
She's a guest.
If she wants something to eat,

14:54.685 --> 14:56.312
-she should--
-She's been eating all night.

14:56.437 --> 14:57.814
We have to have some boundaries.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.774
I'll make you a nice breakfast
in the morning.

14:59.982 --> 15:03.027
In the morning... soon.

15:03.528 --> 15:04.362
Go.

15:04.445 --> 15:05.655
Come on. Go.

15:06.114 --> 15:06.948
Goodnight.

15:07.907 --> 15:08.908
She seems nice.

15:11.369 --> 15:13.955
-I think Mom had a dress like that.
-Goodnight.

15:16.165 --> 15:17.333
[traffic noises]

15:19.419 --> 15:21.421
[policemen chattering]

15:22.755 --> 15:25.675
I've created an algorithm
to determine where he's headed.

15:26.217 --> 15:29.137
It uses the most recent credible
sightings of the fugitive,

15:29.220 --> 15:32.432
along with the behavior patterns
of the previous 210 escapees.

15:32.598 --> 15:33.683
So where's he heading?

15:33.891 --> 15:36.102
He's headed to
either the Port Authority...

15:36.644 --> 15:38.896
or Athens, Greece.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.279
[policemen chattering]

16:01.085 --> 16:04.297
So, when do we get to meet
your new <i>FrÃ¤ulein</i> roommate?

16:04.380 --> 16:07.967
[laughs] You may never meet her.
She doesn't really come upstairs.

16:08.050 --> 16:10.470
She... loves the basement.

16:11.095 --> 16:13.514
Cora? You around tomorrow 2nd shift?

16:13.639 --> 16:15.892
We're putting together
a surprise party for Flanagan.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.268
That sounds great.

16:17.435 --> 16:19.103
Sounds great.
I don't think she can make it,

16:19.187 --> 16:20.730
because, you know, all hands on deck.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.857
-I think I'll stop by.
-I've got a rabbit on the run.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.318
-I've got to go get that thing.
-I can definitely make it.

16:25.401 --> 16:26.319
Sounds good.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.112
-What time? Five o'clock.
-FIve o'clock.

16:28.196 --> 16:30.072
-Perfect.
-Why do you do this to me?

16:30.406 --> 16:31.324
Yo, TJ.

16:31.866 --> 16:32.700
Dad?

16:33.701 --> 16:35.036
Hey. What do you say, son?

16:35.161 --> 16:36.245
What are you doing here?

16:36.329 --> 16:38.414
You forgot your lunch.
I don't want you to miss a meal.

16:38.789 --> 16:39.832
-Really?
-Yeah.

16:41.417 --> 16:42.668
Where is it?
Where's my lunch?

16:43.127 --> 16:45.922
[laughs] Holy... I forgot it.

16:46.297 --> 16:47.465
Is that crazy?

16:47.632 --> 16:49.967
-And I came all this way.
-You sure did.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.053
Now that I'm here...

16:52.261 --> 16:53.095
How's it going?

16:54.055 --> 16:55.431
I wish they were all this seasoned.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.808
He left his shirt here
with his own blood on it...

16:57.934 --> 16:58.809
and a hair sample.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.896
Yeah, exhibit A. The murder weapon.

17:02.230 --> 17:05.024
It came from a workshop in the prison.
Complete with prints.

17:05.650 --> 17:06.526
Is this him?

17:07.276 --> 17:08.152
Is this Quinlan?

17:09.320 --> 17:10.446
Signature Motors?

17:10.530 --> 17:11.489
It's funny...

17:11.697 --> 17:14.492
I bought my first
and last Chevy Impala from these guys.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.495
Technically,
the business belonged to the wife.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.998
-Her father started the company.
-There you go. There's your motive.

17:21.499 --> 17:22.333
For what?

17:22.542 --> 17:24.919
For this guy, Quinlan, to do his old lady.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.421
A dealership like this,
what is it worth, millions.

17:27.505 --> 17:29.715
And what are you talking about?
There's no mystery here.

17:29.799 --> 17:32.134
Sometimes things
are just exactly what they seem.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.720
Sherman Smalls broke out of prison.
He broke into the house.

17:34.804 --> 17:36.973
He bludgeoned that poor woman to death.

17:37.348 --> 17:38.266
He is the guy.

17:39.809 --> 17:40.643
He's the guy.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.526
I thought you might be hungry.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.529
Hey, what... Where'd you find this?

17:51.612 --> 17:52.697
I was saving this.

17:54.073 --> 17:54.949
Thank you.

17:55.783 --> 17:56.993
-Here.
-[Sherman slurps]

17:57.952 --> 17:59.870
-How's it look?
-Not good.

18:00.997 --> 18:02.540
-Bad?
-Yes, bad.

18:02.790 --> 18:05.793
I was out at the cabin.
They're collecting busloads of evidence.

18:05.876 --> 18:06.961
DNA, fingerprints...

18:07.044 --> 18:08.087
Not mine.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.089
We'll know soon enough.

18:10.881 --> 18:15.136
-You believe me, don't you Tony?
-I want to Sherman. I'm trying.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.055
Let me see something.

18:19.056 --> 18:20.016
What are you doing?

18:20.099 --> 18:21.684
I'm looking for cuts and scratches.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.728
Your blood was all over the cabin.

18:23.811 --> 18:26.147
-Are you hurt?
-I don't think so. [groans]

18:26.439 --> 18:27.982
Hey! What are you doing?

18:28.065 --> 18:29.025
Keep that wig on.

18:29.233 --> 18:33.154
-Remember, you don't speak English.
-No, I speak German, like <i>mein</i><i>Mutter.</i>

18:33.487 --> 18:36.324
[laughs] Exactly, like your<i> Mutter,</i>
whatever the hell that is.

18:37.158 --> 18:38.284
Maybe I should comb it back.

18:38.367 --> 18:39.744
No leave it alone.

18:39.827 --> 18:41.787
-It's fine.
-I can barely see my face.

18:41.912 --> 18:43.539
That's right. Exactly.

18:43.623 --> 18:44.665
That's a good thing.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.500
Your hair looks great.

18:46.584 --> 18:47.543
Just the way it is.

18:47.710 --> 18:49.045
Don't change a thing.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.339
<i>-Guten Nacht.</i>
<i>-</i>[door opens and grinds]

18:59.221 --> 19:00.806
Is that <i>the</i>Â Brunello?

19:03.601 --> 19:05.061
Must be a special occasion.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.604
Listen, Junior.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.356
No, no Dad,Â it's okay.
Don't worry about it.

19:08.522 --> 19:11.317
You don't have to say anything.
You don't have to explain. It's all good.

19:12.026 --> 19:14.779
At least she's closer to your age.
[laughs and takes a deep breath]

19:17.823 --> 19:18.783
I'm happy for you.

19:20.785 --> 19:21.619
Thank you.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.754
Some more forensics came in.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.383
Blood on the T-shirt:

19:35.466 --> 19:37.885
Positive match, Sherman Smalls.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.221
Hair samples found on the floor:

19:40.304 --> 19:42.348
Positive match, Sherman Smalls.

19:42.723 --> 19:44.433
Fingerprints on the murder weapon:

19:44.517 --> 19:46.394
positive match, Sandra Bullock.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.231
-The actress?
-I'm kidding.

19:50.606 --> 19:51.732
It's Sherman Smalls.

19:52.483 --> 19:54.944
Any one of these items
would be enough to convict.

19:55.319 --> 19:57.905
Now, all we've got to do
is find the son of a bitch.

19:58.572 --> 20:01.033
I'm glad it's not Sandra Bullock.
I like her.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.786
Did you ever see her in that movie...

20:04.412 --> 20:05.705
<i>-Gravity.</i>
<i>-</i>[Burl] Good movie.

20:05.788 --> 20:06.622
Yes, it is.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.457
I couldn't stay for the whole thing.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.459
What happens
after they get stuck in space?

20:10.668 --> 20:12.670
[policemen chattering]

20:15.506 --> 20:18.634
-[Tony Jr.] This is nice.
-Yeah, this is a great idea.

20:18.759 --> 20:22.805
We can't keep our new guest eating alone
down in the basement every night. Can we?

20:23.848 --> 20:25.683
Elke, I hope you're hungry.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.560
My father is an amazing cook.

20:28.519 --> 20:30.479
He used to say to me
when I was young, growing up,

20:30.563 --> 20:32.690
"First we eat,
then we do everything else."

20:33.190 --> 20:35.985
-I never said that in my life.
-You used to say that all the time.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.404
-He's very funny.
-At ease, Junior.

20:40.531 --> 20:41.741
To new beginnings.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.877
[Tony Jr.] So Elke, how long
do we have you here for?

20:55.004 --> 20:55.838
How...

20:57.548 --> 20:58.966
I looked it up online.

20:59.049 --> 21:00.801
I have it here. [chuckles]

21:00.968 --> 21:01.802
Silly.

21:02.136 --> 21:03.137
Okay.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.598
[Tony Jr. speaking German]

21:05.681 --> 21:07.516
We don't have to
bombard her with questions.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.101
Can't we just enjoy the meal?

21:09.185 --> 21:10.311
I looked it up. It's easy.

21:10.394 --> 21:11.270
Not very long.

21:11.812 --> 21:13.814
[piano music playing]

21:15.107 --> 21:16.358
Very good.

21:17.193 --> 21:18.444
Very well said.

21:18.944 --> 21:21.155
I speak some English now.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.656
I don't think you do.

21:22.907 --> 21:23.908
I think I do.

21:24.408 --> 21:25.743
How about that?

21:25.826 --> 21:27.620
She picked up a couple of phrases.

21:27.745 --> 21:30.164
[laughs] Good for you, Elke.

21:30.539 --> 21:31.957
On another subject...

21:32.374 --> 21:35.336
How's the manhunt going?
Anybody looking at the husband yet?

21:35.503 --> 21:37.129
There's nothing to look at, Dad.

21:37.963 --> 21:39.006
Who stands to gain?

21:39.089 --> 21:41.467
That's the first question
every cop should ask.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.010
The husband, Quinlan.

21:43.093 --> 21:43.969
He's not right.

21:44.053 --> 21:46.347
I'd agree with you,
but then we'd both be wrong.

21:47.765 --> 21:49.433
We're chasing a bad man.

21:55.022 --> 21:56.148
A bad man...

21:57.191 --> 21:59.235
was in prison...

22:00.194 --> 22:02.905
and he went through the sewer

22:03.614 --> 22:04.532
to escape.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.535
And then he went to a cabin,

22:08.118 --> 22:09.662
a little house in the woods...

22:10.704 --> 22:12.456
and he killed a lady.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.124
[forks and knives clinking]

22:14.208 --> 22:15.793
And then he ran off.

22:16.794 --> 22:17.711
Where did he go?

22:18.128 --> 22:19.421
Any ideas on that?

22:19.922 --> 22:22.883
He's got a daughter named Brooke
in Elmhurst. We've tapped the phones,

22:22.967 --> 22:23.843
staked the place out.

22:24.134 --> 22:25.219
You think he'll show?

22:25.594 --> 22:27.555
If he's smart he won't. She hates him.

22:28.389 --> 22:30.933
She never forgave him for going
to the bar that night and drinking,

22:31.016 --> 22:34.728
and killing that poor guy.
She said they're better off without him.

22:38.315 --> 22:39.817
Elke, do you have children?

22:40.901 --> 22:41.902
<i>Kinder?</i>

22:43.445 --> 22:45.447
[sniffs and starts crying]

22:50.911 --> 22:51.745
Oh God.

22:53.497 --> 22:54.540
Is she okay?

22:55.583 --> 22:58.878
American food.
It probably gave her the... squirts.

23:09.513 --> 23:11.348
[lady] You should be in bed, Mickey.

23:11.432 --> 23:12.975
I could have sent these over.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.102
The lawyers want to get started.

23:16.061 --> 23:18.522
They want to transfer the title
as soon as possible.

23:18.814 --> 23:20.399
Well, I think they're vultures.

23:20.482 --> 23:22.943
I'm sorry. It's disrespectful to Helen.

23:23.068 --> 23:23.903
I know.

23:24.403 --> 23:25.279
It's...

23:26.071 --> 23:26.947
terrible.

23:27.573 --> 23:29.366
[lady] There's a man here for you.

23:30.117 --> 23:31.577
He's been waiting all day.

23:31.702 --> 23:33.704
-[people walking by]
-[chattering]

23:41.795 --> 23:43.714
-Good afternoon.
-How are you doing?

23:44.423 --> 23:46.550
That is a beautiful machine.

23:46.800 --> 23:47.885
No question about it.

23:48.844 --> 23:50.638
[Tony Sr.] You guys still sell Impalas?

23:50.804 --> 23:53.682
We can find anything you want.
Would you like to talk to a salesman?

23:53.766 --> 23:56.310
No, I think I'd like to talk to you.

23:57.019 --> 23:58.228
I'm Tony Caruso.

23:59.313 --> 24:01.815
I thought you looked familiar.
You're the detective that...

24:02.066 --> 24:04.818
Yeah, that set a bad example
for the children.

24:04.902 --> 24:06.195
-Yeah.
-That was me.

24:06.570 --> 24:09.198
I met your son.
He took my statement at the hospital.

24:09.990 --> 24:11.867
-It's funny that he became a...
-A cop?

24:12.117 --> 24:13.243
Yeah.

24:13.494 --> 24:15.162
We laugh about that all the time.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.456
So, you're thinking about an Impala?

24:17.539 --> 24:20.376
Actually, I'm thinking about
Sherman Smalls.

24:20.501 --> 24:21.961
I got to know him in prison,

24:22.044 --> 24:24.421
and I've taken a personal interest
in the case.

24:26.507 --> 24:27.383
Well, I can't...

24:27.716 --> 24:28.550
help you!

24:29.301 --> 24:31.303
Even if I could, I wouldn't.

24:32.680 --> 24:35.057
That man took the most precious thing
in my life.

24:35.140 --> 24:37.434
I know, I heard... and believe me.

24:37.518 --> 24:39.103
I'm really sorry about that.

24:43.816 --> 24:44.858
Is there a problem?

24:44.942 --> 24:47.027
Well, he really clocked you.

24:48.195 --> 24:49.863
[laughs] But, it's funny.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.574
I've seen Sherm box, you know, and...

24:53.200 --> 24:55.661
when the guys would
square off in the yard, but...

24:56.078 --> 24:58.330
But Sherm was a southpaw.

24:58.956 --> 25:00.874
So, he would have hit you like this.

25:03.210 --> 25:04.294
On the other side.

25:05.796 --> 25:09.008
I don't really... remember much.
It all happened pretty quick.

25:09.091 --> 25:11.760
But I think his left hand was injured.

25:13.095 --> 25:14.388
He was cut, he was bleeding.

25:15.222 --> 25:16.515
That would explain it.

25:18.100 --> 25:20.644
Anyway, you were down, down for the count.

25:21.603 --> 25:23.689
-And then he grabbed the hammer?
-Yeah.

25:24.606 --> 25:25.441
That's right.

25:25.816 --> 25:28.402
The hammer that he brought with him
from the prison.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.114
That's funny.

25:32.656 --> 25:34.616
You said you didn't want
to help me, but...

25:35.451 --> 25:37.453
I think you just helped me quite a bit.

25:49.757 --> 25:50.674
Hey, stranger.

25:58.515 --> 26:00.309
Baby, look at you.

26:00.768 --> 26:02.227
It was a small price to pay.

26:02.394 --> 26:05.189
I couldn't believe you called.
You said no contact for three months.

26:05.355 --> 26:06.398
Something came up.

26:06.857 --> 26:07.816
I'm glad it did.

26:08.817 --> 26:10.444
I've been going out of my skull.

26:10.861 --> 26:12.613
CNN, every newspaper...

26:13.155 --> 26:15.908
At work, it's even worse.
It's all anybody talks about.

26:17.785 --> 26:18.702
What was it like?

26:18.786 --> 26:19.703
No, Lois...

26:21.580 --> 26:22.414
Don't even ask.

26:22.498 --> 26:23.499
I have to know.

26:24.166 --> 26:25.292
Did she suffer?

26:26.335 --> 26:27.753
I mean, much?

26:31.507 --> 26:32.800
She never saw it coming.

26:34.885 --> 26:37.721
We'd been going up every weekend,
Helen hated it.

26:38.514 --> 26:39.515
I know she did.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.225
<i>Still pretty cloudy.</i>

26:41.475 --> 26:42.601
<i>WeI'll see something.</i>

26:45.145 --> 26:47.272
<i>Is this a funny sort of midlife crisis?</i>

26:47.731 --> 26:49.817
<i>Astronomy and renting this place...</i>

26:50.317 --> 26:51.151
<i>Hey.</i>

26:51.401 --> 26:52.402
<i>Look at me.</i>

26:53.112 --> 26:54.738
<i>I feel like we're starting over.</i>

26:55.072 --> 26:57.074
[alarm jail siren]

26:58.450 --> 26:59.326
<i>Is that a siren?</i>

27:01.703 --> 27:02.788
<i>It's from the prison.</i>

27:04.331 --> 27:05.249
<i>What prison?</i>

27:08.168 --> 27:09.253
<i>Maguire Correctional.</i>

27:10.337 --> 27:11.463
<i>It's just up the road.</i>

27:12.840 --> 27:13.799
<i>What's it mean?</i>

27:15.300 --> 27:17.219
<i>It means Sherman Smalls just escaped.</i>

27:17.803 --> 27:19.388
<i>Who's Sherman Smalls?</i>

27:24.184 --> 27:25.811
What about after? How did you?

27:26.603 --> 27:27.437
This?

27:28.522 --> 27:30.357
I had to have it look like a real fight.

27:31.233 --> 27:33.152
[batteries clinking]

27:33.277 --> 27:35.988
I used a ceiling fan
and a sock full of batteries.

28:05.517 --> 28:06.894
There's a reason I called.

28:08.020 --> 28:08.854
We have a problem.

28:21.283 --> 28:22.743
[clears throat]

28:22.910 --> 28:23.744
I'm sorry.

28:24.036 --> 28:25.329
I was just doing...

28:26.205 --> 28:27.748
Laundry, just doing laundry.

28:28.874 --> 28:31.418
[Sherman speaking German]

28:33.837 --> 28:34.671
Okay. [laughs]

28:37.633 --> 28:39.259
As long as I'm down here...

28:41.386 --> 28:44.097
I just want... [clears throat]
...to say thank you.

28:45.474 --> 28:47.476
[Tony Jr. in German] <i>Danke.</i>

28:49.603 --> 28:52.314
I know you probably don't understand
anything that I'm saying,

28:53.148 --> 28:54.024
but...

28:55.400 --> 28:57.361
I think you're good for my father.

28:58.570 --> 28:59.404
And...

29:00.072 --> 29:02.074
it's just... [exhales]

29:04.576 --> 29:06.411
It's nice to have a woman
in the house again.

29:09.248 --> 29:10.582
[Tony Jr. in German] <i>Danke.</i>

29:14.711 --> 29:16.171
You are welcome.

29:27.808 --> 29:29.810
[Sherman sighs]

29:37.943 --> 29:38.819
Is that him?

29:40.696 --> 29:43.115
No that's his son.
The one that took my statement

29:43.573 --> 29:45.200
It's a father and son?

29:45.951 --> 29:48.370
Are they working together?
How much do they know?

29:50.080 --> 29:52.249
We have been planning this for a year.

29:52.332 --> 29:54.584
-How did this happen?
-I don't know.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.545
You said it was airtight.

29:56.753 --> 29:57.879
I'll take care of it.

29:59.715 --> 30:01.091
I'll do what I have to do.

30:14.396 --> 30:15.230
Who's that?

30:15.856 --> 30:17.858
No idea. Maybe his grandmother?

30:29.161 --> 30:30.912
That's not his grandmother.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.837
-[bell]
-[people shouting]

30:45.594 --> 30:46.428
That's her.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.138
Brook Smalls, she's up next.

30:48.847 --> 30:49.931
You think he'll show?

30:50.640 --> 30:52.434
He wrote 85 letters last year,

30:52.517 --> 30:53.435
all to her.

30:53.769 --> 30:55.937
If he's still in the city...
he'll be here.

30:56.021 --> 30:57.898
[man shouting] Take her down, Jeannie!

30:58.065 --> 31:00.317
Take her to school, babe. [laughs]

31:04.154 --> 31:05.113
That's her husband?

31:06.114 --> 31:07.991
I bet he never misses an anniversary.

31:08.158 --> 31:08.992
Break it up.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.120
Jeannie's about to get nailed.
She keeps dropping her left.

31:12.204 --> 31:15.040
-[man] I love you so much.
-[audience] <i>Oooooooh!</i>

31:15.499 --> 31:16.917
Where did you learn that?

31:17.542 --> 31:18.585
I've boxed a little.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.380
[knockout countdown]

31:22.339 --> 31:24.674
[Cora laughs]
I'm not from Scarsdale, Caruso.

31:26.009 --> 31:27.302
You think you could take me?

31:28.428 --> 31:29.304
No comment.

31:29.805 --> 31:32.516
I'm serious.Â You think you could take me
if we were in that ring?

31:33.975 --> 31:35.769
You wouldn't last two minutes.

31:37.187 --> 31:39.272
Well, I guess we'll never know, will we?

31:41.650 --> 31:44.444
[Cora shouts] Excuse me,
is there room on the undercard?

31:44.820 --> 31:46.947
Do you think we could go next?
She's kidding.

31:48.407 --> 31:49.866
She thinks she's very funny.

31:50.033 --> 31:52.369
-Carry-on. Sorry.
-I am hilarious.

31:53.078 --> 31:55.288
Does the word incognito
mean nothing to you?

32:01.586 --> 32:02.671
[Tony Jr.] Is that Elke?

32:03.463 --> 32:04.297
[Cora] Who?

32:04.589 --> 32:06.341
The woman renting our basement.

32:06.466 --> 32:07.426
In the overcoat?

32:07.884 --> 32:08.760
She looks...

32:10.512 --> 32:11.346
nice...

32:12.681 --> 32:13.849
and strong.

32:14.307 --> 32:15.142
Yes, she is.

32:16.184 --> 32:17.018
She's nice...

32:17.686 --> 32:18.520
and...

32:19.312 --> 32:20.188
strong.

32:20.522 --> 32:21.440
What's she doing here?

32:22.691 --> 32:23.942
Well, maybe she's...

32:24.025 --> 32:26.027
[people chattering]

32:27.571 --> 32:28.447
I got nothin'.

32:28.530 --> 32:31.783
[presenter] Ladies and gentlemen,
the next contest of the evening.

32:31.992 --> 32:33.285
Your dad's here.

32:34.286 --> 32:35.245
Are they together?

32:35.328 --> 32:37.789
[presenter] Introducing...
in the red corner.

32:38.081 --> 32:40.375
competing for Gleason's Gymnasium?

32:40.625 --> 32:43.378
Corinna Gitano.

32:44.713 --> 32:45.589
Her opponent...

32:45.672 --> 32:46.756
in the blue corner,

32:46.840 --> 32:49.342
from Elmhurst, Queens, New York,

32:49.759 --> 32:52.429
Brooke Smalls.

32:52.679 --> 32:53.847
Go, Brookie, go.

32:58.018 --> 32:59.102
Oh my God.

32:59.936 --> 33:00.770
What?

33:02.314 --> 33:03.773
I want to talk to my father.

33:03.857 --> 33:04.691
Excuse me.

33:04.774 --> 33:05.734
Is everything okay?

33:07.068 --> 33:07.944
It's my father.

33:08.195 --> 33:09.529
So... no.

33:09.654 --> 33:11.656
[people shouting]

33:14.284 --> 33:15.202
[Sherman] Stay on her.

33:16.036 --> 33:17.120
You're a woman, remember?

33:18.288 --> 33:19.748
Move, move... come on. Move!

33:19.915 --> 33:21.500
Remember, you're a German woman.

33:21.625 --> 33:23.418
I don't know how to box in German.

33:23.502 --> 33:24.586
I'd like to box you.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.671
That's it. Stick the left. Stick the left!

33:26.838 --> 33:28.381
That's it. That's the way.

33:29.299 --> 33:31.176
Sherman, would you stop?

33:33.595 --> 33:34.429
Hi, son.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.097
Aiding and abetting.

33:36.890 --> 33:39.017
Aiding and abetting.
It's a ten year sentence, minimum.

33:39.100 --> 33:39.976
What were you thinking?

33:40.101 --> 33:41.937
-Can I say something?
-No, you can't.You know why?

33:42.020 --> 33:43.897
'Cause you're under arrest,
you're not from Dusseldorf,

33:43.980 --> 33:46.441
And we have 300 cops combing the city
right now looking for you.

33:46.525 --> 33:48.777
Before you blow your whistle,
would you just listen to him?

33:48.860 --> 33:50.987
-Give us ten seconds.
-I don't care if he's your friend.

33:51.071 --> 33:52.906
-It's Murder One.
-Damn right, it's Murder One.

33:52.989 --> 33:54.783
-He didn't do it.
-He didn't do what? Escape?

33:54.866 --> 33:57.369
No, of course he escaped.
He just didn't kill the lady.

33:57.452 --> 33:59.704
His DNA is all over that cabin.

33:59.788 --> 34:02.165
Come on, son, you're getting
stuck in the details.

34:02.582 --> 34:03.416
The details?

34:03.500 --> 34:04.876
He's going to turn himself in.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.754
Just not yet. Just listen, will you?
Look at each other.

34:07.921 --> 34:10.423
Tell him how you escaped.
Tell him your story. Listen to this.

34:10.507 --> 34:11.424
I got lucky.

34:12.884 --> 34:14.261
It all sort of fell my way.

34:15.136 --> 34:16.054
About a month ago,

34:16.137 --> 34:18.848
I was transferred to a new cell, 14C.

34:24.396 --> 34:26.982
And the guy who was in there before me,
Milo Linkletter,

34:27.065 --> 34:30.360
must have been planning to bust out,
because I found a map to the prison.

34:36.366 --> 34:38.285
And a little while later,
behind the toilet,

34:38.368 --> 34:39.869
I found a whole escape kit.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.044
[Tony Sr.] Tell him about the kit.

34:49.462 --> 34:51.298
[Sherman] He had it all planned out.

34:53.258 --> 34:55.760
There was the map, a guard uniform...

34:56.386 --> 34:57.596
a key to the cell,

34:57.679 --> 35:01.099
a backup copy of the key,
a train schedule.

35:02.517 --> 35:05.937
It was like winning the lottery.
it was better than winning the lottery.

35:06.062 --> 35:09.774
-Because I got to see my baby fight.
-[Tony Sr.] How convenient is that?

35:10.400 --> 35:12.444
An escape kit behind the toilet?

35:12.527 --> 35:13.903
[presenter] Ladies and gentlemen...

35:14.195 --> 35:15.697
The winner by decision,

35:16.364 --> 35:18.908
in the blue corner, Brooke Smalls.

35:19.034 --> 35:20.118
She won.

35:20.285 --> 35:21.161
Did you see her, Tony?

35:21.244 --> 35:23.038
-She was great, right?
-She was terrific.

35:24.289 --> 35:25.957
Listen, the guy's hinky.

35:26.041 --> 35:26.875
I can smell it.

35:26.958 --> 35:28.710
-What guy?
-Quinlan, the husband.

35:29.002 --> 35:30.045
Who escapes from prison

35:30.128 --> 35:32.255
and carries a hammer half a mile
through the woods?

35:32.339 --> 35:34.799
Plus, Quinlan was hit
on one side of his face.

35:35.008 --> 35:35.842
The wrong side.

35:36.051 --> 35:39.012
Plus, Sherman's blood is supposed to be
all over that t-shirt.

35:39.095 --> 35:39.971
Take a look at him.

35:40.221 --> 35:41.890
There's not a scratch on him.

35:42.015 --> 35:44.017
[people chattering]

35:47.812 --> 35:49.064
[sighs] Dammit.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.109
Why is he so mad?

35:53.568 --> 35:54.903
Because I'm right.

36:00.659 --> 36:03.328
[policeman] We rotate prisoners
from cell to cell on a regular basis.

36:03.411 --> 36:06.665
We do it to address overcrowding,
or break up potential rivalries.

36:06.748 --> 36:08.750
That's why Sherman Smalls
was moved to 14C.

36:09.584 --> 36:10.919
When was he transferred?

36:11.127 --> 36:12.170
A month ago.

36:12.712 --> 36:13.963
Why that particular cell?

36:14.255 --> 36:17.133
That's a question for Lois Ronstadt,
my administrative assistant.

36:17.425 --> 36:19.719
Cell assignments, transfers
that's her bailiwick.

36:20.428 --> 36:21.262
Lois?

36:22.347 --> 36:25.308
This is Detective Caruso
from the All-City Homicide Task Force.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.311
He has a few more questions
about Sherman Smalls.

36:28.395 --> 36:30.730
Detective, I've been talking
to the marshalls all week.

36:30.814 --> 36:32.899
-I don't know what else I can add.
-I appreciate that.

36:32.982 --> 36:34.901
I'll try not to take too much
of your time.

36:35.777 --> 36:38.446
I understand that Mr.Â Smalls was only
in his cell a few weeks.

36:38.530 --> 36:39.364
That's right.

36:40.073 --> 36:42.158
An escape like that seems
like it would take

36:42.242 --> 36:43.660
months, even years to plan.

36:43.910 --> 36:46.246
Well, the prisoner who was there
before him, Milo Linklater,

36:46.329 --> 36:47.789
was a well-known escape risk.

36:47.914 --> 36:50.333
Smalls must have found
some of his escape paraphernalia.

36:50.917 --> 36:52.627
I'd like to talk to Mr. Linklater.

36:52.919 --> 36:54.254
You won't have much luck.

36:54.462 --> 36:55.672
Milo Linklater's dead.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.298
Heart attack five weeks ago.

36:57.882 --> 36:59.426
That's how the cell became available.

37:00.260 --> 37:01.678
And you didn't search the cell?

37:01.761 --> 37:02.637
We thought we had.

37:02.762 --> 37:04.180
Hindsight, as they say.

37:04.848 --> 37:06.850
[phone ringing]

37:08.601 --> 37:10.520
I noticed a new Mercedes out front.
Is that yours?

37:11.312 --> 37:12.147
Yes, it is.

37:13.022 --> 37:13.898
Signature Motors.

37:13.982 --> 37:14.858
That's right.

37:15.692 --> 37:17.152
Hope you didn't pay too much.

37:17.652 --> 37:18.737
I think I did okay.

37:18.903 --> 37:20.655
You have to know someone,
that's the secret.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.699
Get that friends and family discount.

37:24.826 --> 37:27.537
Did you get the friends
and family discount, Lois?

37:27.746 --> 37:28.580
No.

37:28.913 --> 37:29.789
I wish I did.

37:32.792 --> 37:34.377
Any other questions, Detective?

37:36.004 --> 37:36.838
No...

37:37.797 --> 37:39.007
I'm good. Thank you.

37:49.559 --> 37:52.061
Hey, Sherm!

37:52.145 --> 37:53.271
Hold it.

37:53.646 --> 37:54.522
Where are you going?

37:54.606 --> 37:57.233
I've got to go, Tony.
I've been enough trouble.

37:57.984 --> 38:00.737
You told TJ you were going to wait
until he gets back. Remember?

38:00.820 --> 38:02.071
Tell your boy I'm sorry.

38:02.864 --> 38:04.949
-Where are you going to go?
-Queens.

38:05.074 --> 38:07.660
-I'm going to say goodbye to Brooke.
-And then what?

38:07.869 --> 38:10.330
I want what's best for both of us,
if you don't know.

38:11.706 --> 38:12.582
Do you know?

38:15.502 --> 38:16.503
No.

38:16.878 --> 38:18.755
-[door knocking]
-Hang on, hang on.

38:19.589 --> 38:20.840
Hang on one second.

38:24.469 --> 38:25.345
Quinlan?

38:25.512 --> 38:27.180
I'm sorry to bother you,

38:27.472 --> 38:29.349
but you told me to get in touch
if I thought of anything.

38:29.432 --> 38:30.642
-Yeah.
-Well, um...

38:31.893 --> 38:32.894
I thought of something.

38:33.019 --> 38:34.020
-Get inside!
-Okay.

38:34.187 --> 38:35.688
Don't move.

38:35.814 --> 38:36.689
Take it easy.

38:37.190 --> 38:38.066
Take it easy.

38:40.026 --> 38:41.194
Are you Sherman Smalls?

38:43.321 --> 38:44.155
Thank you.

38:45.031 --> 38:45.949
For what?

38:47.200 --> 38:48.076
Killing my wife.

38:48.451 --> 38:49.619
Oh Jesus!

38:49.786 --> 38:51.871
-[searching noises]
-What is he doing?

38:53.122 --> 38:54.582
Maybe he's straightening up.

38:55.083 --> 38:56.501
[both grunt]

38:57.544 --> 38:59.546
God , you'd think I'd be able
to get out of this?

38:59.838 --> 39:02.173
I just escaped
from a high-security prison.

39:08.179 --> 39:09.138
[car door opens]

39:10.139 --> 39:11.766
[car door closes and sets alarm]

39:11.933 --> 39:12.809
It's TJ.

39:31.077 --> 39:32.453
TJ, Quinlan's here.

39:32.620 --> 39:35.331
-[cocks gun]
-He's in the house.

39:36.624 --> 39:37.584
Easy.

39:38.418 --> 39:40.420
[both grunt]

39:43.214 --> 39:45.216
[fighting thumps]

39:49.429 --> 39:51.431
[both grunt]

40:00.481 --> 40:01.399
Who won?

40:02.400 --> 40:03.860
That's one tough car dealer.

40:08.031 --> 40:08.865
Where are you?

40:08.948 --> 40:10.950
-[phone ringing]
-[sighs]

40:11.034 --> 40:13.036
[policemen chattering]

40:15.163 --> 40:16.414
You okay??

40:22.879 --> 40:23.755
Ryan.

40:24.213 --> 40:25.548
Can you remove that beard?

40:25.840 --> 40:26.674
I can do that.

40:28.217 --> 40:29.093
You're good.

40:29.719 --> 40:31.095
Let's see him in glasses.

40:32.513 --> 40:33.848
Not those.

40:34.432 --> 40:35.725
Those are my glasses.

40:36.434 --> 40:37.268
Sorry...

40:37.894 --> 40:38.811
Lady glasses.

40:40.688 --> 40:42.106
Now the hair. Give him a wig.

40:42.523 --> 40:43.399
What kind?

40:53.159 --> 40:54.035
Oh my God.

40:54.243 --> 40:55.244
You know her?

40:57.288 --> 40:58.373
Now, what's he doing?

41:02.543 --> 41:03.753
He's sealing the windows.

41:10.134 --> 41:11.427
That's the oven.

41:11.719 --> 41:12.762
What's he baking?

41:13.638 --> 41:14.472
Us.

41:16.724 --> 41:17.600
That's the gas.

41:17.684 --> 41:18.935
He's going to blow up the house.

41:19.018 --> 41:20.812
Why? I don't understand.

41:21.437 --> 41:23.231
Because we know too much, Sherman.

41:23.815 --> 41:26.609
His girlfriend works at the prison.
She moved you into the cell.

41:26.693 --> 41:28.653
She arranged for your escape.

41:29.612 --> 41:31.990
Quinlan just waited for the sirens,
then he killed his wife.

41:32.573 --> 41:35.284
Then he planted evidence
incriminating you, all over the cabin.

41:36.911 --> 41:39.414
It's a pretty decent plan, actually.
I have to hand it to him.

41:40.373 --> 41:42.375
[Tony Sr. laughs]

41:43.918 --> 41:44.752
What's so funny?

41:47.630 --> 41:49.340
Nobody's blowing anybody up.

41:50.842 --> 41:54.137
I didn't pay the gas bill.
[continues laughing]

41:54.554 --> 41:56.556
[both Sherman and Tony Sr. laughing]

41:57.098 --> 41:58.433
I paid the gas bill.

41:59.475 --> 42:00.518
-What?
-Why?

42:00.601 --> 42:02.895
Because it's a bill, Dad.
It's supposed to be paid.

42:02.979 --> 42:04.105
I told you I'd handle it.

42:04.188 --> 42:05.148
But you didn't.

42:05.857 --> 42:08.067
You see what happens
when you play by the rules?

42:08.234 --> 42:09.736
I hope you've learned a lesson here.

42:10.987 --> 42:12.989
[toaster ticking]

42:25.501 --> 42:26.836
I forgot that was there.

42:28.629 --> 42:31.132
-[door bangs]
-[policeman] Don't move!

42:32.425 --> 42:33.676
-Freeze!
-[stuff breaking]

42:35.428 --> 42:36.262
[Cora] There he goes.

42:36.804 --> 42:38.598
Let me see your hands.
You're under arrest.

42:38.681 --> 42:39.766
-Get on your knees!
-Cora?

42:39.849 --> 42:41.267
Down here!

42:41.642 --> 42:42.685
Cora, down here!

42:42.852 --> 42:44.604
-Cora!
-I'll check the basement.

42:49.192 --> 42:51.110
I think you boys have
some explaining to do.

42:51.194 --> 42:52.236
Are you Cora?

42:52.320 --> 42:53.154
Yeah.

42:53.321 --> 42:54.530
[Tony Sr. laughs]

42:55.031 --> 42:56.407
-Hi.
-Hey.

42:58.201 --> 43:00.411
That combinationÂ at the end
of the first round.

43:00.536 --> 43:01.704
That was a thing of beauty.

43:01.871 --> 43:03.456
-Thank you.
-It's 10:30.

43:04.123 --> 43:05.166
The judge is waiting.

43:05.249 --> 43:06.375
Give them a minute.

43:06.751 --> 43:08.002
It's his little girl.

43:09.837 --> 43:11.631
[Brooke laughs] What's this?

43:11.714 --> 43:14.550
I'm going to miss
the next four or five birthdays,

43:14.634 --> 43:16.260
so I got you a little something
in advance.

43:16.344 --> 43:18.054
It's not going to take as long as that.

43:18.596 --> 43:21.307
I talked to the DA.
He appreciates everything you've done.

43:22.016 --> 43:22.892
Speed bag.

43:24.519 --> 43:25.436
With your talent,

43:25.561 --> 43:26.646
by the time I get out...

43:26.896 --> 43:28.356
you're going to be a contender.

43:28.439 --> 43:30.441
I might be needing a new manager.

43:31.150 --> 43:32.527
We'll find you a good one.

43:33.986 --> 43:35.363
She means you, Sherman.

43:37.573 --> 43:39.575
[both laugh]

43:41.786 --> 43:42.662
Goodbye, baby.

43:44.914 --> 43:46.332
You know, I miss her already.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.252
I think my dad does too.

43:51.295 --> 43:53.464
[Sherman speaking German]

43:56.592 --> 43:57.677
Whatever you just said.

43:58.970 --> 43:59.887
Right back at you.

44:03.724 --> 44:07.395
Do you know
if cell 14C is still open?

44:08.604 --> 44:09.605
That's my lucky cell.
