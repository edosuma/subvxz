WEBVTT

00:02.200 --> 00:04.900
It's exactly as i described to you.

00:05.200 --> 00:06.900
Gary doesn't lie.

00:09.400 --> 00:12.100
Intimate but not small...
check.

00:12.200 --> 00:14.400
Character... double check.

00:14.500 --> 00:17.000
You see? Gary doesn't lie.

00:19.600 --> 00:20.800
And the best part...

00:21.200 --> 00:24.100
I've been working the owner for months,
convincing her to sell.

00:24.200 --> 00:25.300
You're getting in first.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.200
It's not even on the market yet.

00:32.400 --> 00:35.400
So, you like?

00:35.500 --> 00:36.900
The house? Yes.

00:37.200 --> 00:39.400
Gary? Maybe not.

00:41.300 --> 00:42.900
Good morning, everyone.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.300
Hey. Hello, Doris.

00:45.400 --> 00:47.500
I want you to meet your first
potential buyers...

00:47.600 --> 00:49.400
Fritz and Brenda.

00:49.600 --> 00:51.400
Thank you for coming.

00:51.900 --> 00:55.100
Would anyone like
a freshly baked cookie?

00:58.900 --> 01:00.200
Thank you.

01:00.300 --> 01:01.700
You're welcome.

01:03.700 --> 01:06.800
It's so homey here.
I'm surprised you want to leave.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.500
Oh, i don't, really.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.800
No, i put it on the market
last summer,

01:10.900 --> 01:12.900
and then i changed my mind.

01:13.100 --> 01:15.800
But the house has gone up
in value so much

01:15.900 --> 01:18.800
that everybody thinks i should
take the money and run.

01:20.100 --> 01:20.900
More coffee?

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
- No, i think that...
- yes, please.

01:22.100 --> 01:23.100
Okay.

01:23.900 --> 01:28.800
You know, we raised
three children in this house.

01:29.300 --> 01:33.600
My husband, Tom...
he put those cabinets in himself.

01:33.700 --> 01:34.800
Oh.

01:35.100 --> 01:37.400
- More coffee?
- Yes, thank you.

01:38.700 --> 01:39.400
Hey.

01:39.900 --> 01:42.000
We can rip those out...
no problem.

01:43.700 --> 01:45.200
Goodness!

01:45.500 --> 01:47.400
More company!

01:53.200 --> 01:54.200
Deputy Chief Johnson.

01:54.300 --> 01:55.700
I thought you said this place
wasn't listed yet.

01:55.800 --> 01:56.900
It's not supposed to be.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.300
Yes, Lieutenant, what is it?

01:58.400 --> 02:01.100
Someone at my office must have noticed
it was back on the market.

02:01.300 --> 02:02.500
Why? What happened?

02:03.700 --> 02:04.900
He's how old?

02:05.800 --> 02:08.000
Oh, for heaven's sake.

02:08.500 --> 02:10.199
No, no.
I'll be right there.

02:10.800 --> 02:11.800
Thank you.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.500
What if we wanted to make an offer?

02:15.100 --> 02:16.000
What?

02:21.100 --> 02:23.800
Ö½éïµä×ö

02:24.600 --> 02:26.300
hey, chief.
Fax for you.

02:26.500 --> 02:29.200
- "Rules of escrow"?
- Thank you!

02:32.800 --> 02:35.500
So, this guy was pushing around
some sick old man

02:35.600 --> 02:37.600
in a wheelchair
near Hollywood Boulevard.

02:37.700 --> 02:39.900
A tourist finally gave him
a cellphone to call 911,

02:40.000 --> 02:42.300
but by the time
the paramedics got there,

02:42.400 --> 02:43.500
the guy in the wheelchair was dead,

02:43.600 --> 02:44.900
which might have been
the end of it, but...

02:45.000 --> 02:48.900
except our elderly gentleman here
claimed he murdered the victim.

02:49.100 --> 02:51.400
10 to 1,
here's what happened.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.200
"My heart!"

02:53.700 --> 02:55.100
"Help!

02:55.200 --> 02:56.300
Help!"

02:56.400 --> 02:59.000
And then hollywood division
pushed him our way

02:59.100 --> 03:01.200
so that they could enjoy their sunday.

03:01.400 --> 03:02.600
They're just following the rules, chief.

03:02.700 --> 03:07.300
Thing is, our old guy claims to have killed
six other people the same way.

03:08.500 --> 03:09.600
And how did he do that?

03:09.700 --> 03:10.500
He won't say.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.100
He won't tell us his name, either.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.800
He didn't have any i.d. On him,
and neither did the dead guy.

03:14.900 --> 03:15.800
All right.

03:17.800 --> 03:18.500
Okay.

03:18.600 --> 03:21.200
If i can determine that
this man's delusional,

03:21.300 --> 03:23.400
that he belongs to
the mental evaluation unit,

03:23.500 --> 03:25.400
then we can all go home
and save on overtime.

03:25.500 --> 03:26.800
In the meantime...

03:29.500 --> 03:31.100
detectives daniels and sanchez,

03:31.200 --> 03:32.800
please take a peek at missing persons.

03:32.900 --> 03:35.500
See if anyone's looking for
two nameless old men.

03:35.600 --> 03:39.400
Lieutenant provenza, please make sure that
our victim is on a gurney at the morgue.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.100
And, lieutenant tao,

03:41.800 --> 03:45.900
if you wouldn't mind sending this fax

03:46.400 --> 03:48.700
to the number on the cover sheet...

03:48.800 --> 03:51.400
it's some, um,
thingy for my real-estate agent.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.500
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.100
Good morning, sir.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.700
I'm deputy chief brenda leigh johnson.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.300
Could you please tell me your name?

04:08.900 --> 04:11.000
How about the name of the man
who died?

04:11.300 --> 04:12.600
I murdered him...

04:13.000 --> 04:15.400
and the others...
i killed them all.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.300
And how did you do that?

04:17.800 --> 04:19.100
Poison.

04:19.800 --> 04:22.600
You know that you poisoned
a total of seven people,

04:22.700 --> 04:24.400
but you don't know your name?

04:24.500 --> 04:27.000
Who says i don't know my name?

04:27.600 --> 04:31.400
A deputy chief, huh?
That's pretty impressive.

04:31.600 --> 04:34.600
There's... what? ...12 of you
in the whole department?

04:35.300 --> 04:38.200
Sir, there are several
inconsistencies to your story.

04:38.300 --> 04:42.900
I actually remember that
detective provenza guy who put me in here.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.800
He was a highly motivated
young man.

04:47.800 --> 04:49.300
Bet your sweet ass i was.

04:49.400 --> 04:50.900
Have you been arrested before?

04:51.100 --> 04:54.100
I spent some time here
when i was younger.

04:55.100 --> 04:58.800
What is it about my story
that's inconsistent?

04:59.300 --> 05:01.600
Well, you claim you tried
to poison someone,

05:01.700 --> 05:03.600
and yet, you called 911.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
If you were <i>really</i> trying
to murder someone,

05:06.100 --> 05:07.400
why call for help?

05:07.800 --> 05:11.700
Well, uh, i wanted to see
what it was like...

05:11.800 --> 05:13.400
dying, you know?

05:13.800 --> 05:16.800
I didn't watch the others,
but it went on too long,

05:16.900 --> 05:18.000
and i chickened out.

05:18.100 --> 05:19.200
All right, uh, sir,

05:19.300 --> 05:22.300
l-i'm afraid that you might not be competent
to speak on your own behalf...

05:22.400 --> 05:24.200
you're worried about my sanity, huh?

05:24.300 --> 05:26.500
I have a right to remain silent.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.800
Anything i say can and will
be used against me

05:28.900 --> 05:29.800
- in a court of law.
- Sir.

05:29.900 --> 05:31.200
I have a right to an attorney.

05:31.300 --> 05:32.500
If i cannot afford one,

05:32.600 --> 05:33.700
- et cetera, et cetera.
- Sir.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.300
Blah, blah, blah.

05:35.400 --> 05:38.200
Look, let me make something
completely clear...

05:38.300 --> 05:40.900
i do not want a lawyer.
Understood?

05:41.400 --> 05:43.800
And if you don't know
how to assemble your case,

05:43.900 --> 05:45.700
let me give you a little hint...

05:46.000 --> 05:47.900
bernard kaplan.

05:48.600 --> 05:49.700
Is that your name?

05:49.900 --> 05:53.200
No, it's the name
of your dead john doe.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.500
And i'll trade you the names
of the other six people i killed

05:56.600 --> 05:58.800
if you'll give me something to eat.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.700
Names, please.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.200
Lieutenant provenza,
i'm almost afraid to ask you this...

06:13.300 --> 06:15.700
do you remember anything
about this old man?

06:15.800 --> 06:18.000
Well, if you twisted my arm,
i'd say he looks familiar.

06:18.100 --> 06:19.300
That's about it.

06:21.800 --> 06:24.800
Chief, i ran, uh,

06:24.900 --> 06:28.700
"rumple's" prints through afis
along with bernard kaplan...

06:28.800 --> 06:30.300
no hits on either man.

06:34.400 --> 06:37.300
Tao, what's a rumplestiltskin?

06:38.000 --> 06:39.600
It's a fairy tale.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.600
There's this old dwarf
who won't tell the queen his name,

06:41.700 --> 06:44.300
- and she has to guess it in order to...
- uh-huh.

06:45.500 --> 06:48.600
Well, if rumplestiltskin
<i>has</i> wandered away from home,

06:48.700 --> 06:50.200
it's been less than 24 hours.

06:50.300 --> 06:52.900
Missing persons hasn't generated
a report yet.

06:53.300 --> 06:54.500
All right.
Sergeant gabriel,

06:54.600 --> 06:55.900
let's head over
to the coroner's office,

06:56.000 --> 06:58.300
see if we can get
some death certificates...

07:00.000 --> 07:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:09.100 --> 07:11.800
chief. I can go to the morgue
with you.

07:11.800 --> 07:13.200
We'll sort this out.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.900
Oh, chief, um,
this, uh,

07:16.000 --> 07:17.900
fax didn't quite make it through.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.300
Um, i called the service guy.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.700
He's supposed to be here
tomorrow morning, 11:00 a.m.

07:22.300 --> 07:23.900
Lieutenant tao, thank you.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.100
I'll find another fax machine
along the way.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.100
Gabriel came off suspension
friday night.

07:32.200 --> 07:33.700
Why don't you give him a call
to come in?

07:33.800 --> 07:35.700
But we'll be done with this
before he even gets here.

07:35.800 --> 07:37.600
Would you just do it, flynn?

07:38.200 --> 07:40.100
God, you're a pain in the ass.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.700
Let me guess...
natural causes?

07:49.800 --> 07:51.500
If we were guessing,

07:51.600 --> 07:54.500
i wouldn't be cutting the old guy open
and pulling out his intestines.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.000
I'd still be at brunch...

07:56.100 --> 07:59.100
with my friends,
having a mimosa.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
Well, dr. Morales, i'm so sorry
to interrupt your sunday,

08:03.100 --> 08:07.300
but it's important to establish that
mr. Kaplan here is <i>not</i> a homicide victim.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.900
Well, you better wipe off
your crystal ball, honey,

08:10.000 --> 08:12.300
because this guessing thing
isn't working for you.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.100
Mr. Kaplan <i>was</i> murdered?

08:14.400 --> 08:16.900
You see this nasty irritation
along the esophagus?

08:17.000 --> 08:19.500
Some hemorrhaging, too...
there and there,

08:19.600 --> 08:21.300
and the stomach was pretty torn up.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.000
Which means...

08:23.100 --> 08:25.500
violent vomiting before death.

08:27.300 --> 08:30.100
Even in advance of a tox screen,
i'd say poison.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.799
All the offices with
fax machines were closed, chief,

08:33.900 --> 08:36.000
- so no luck sending this.
- Oh, shoot.

08:36.100 --> 08:40.299
<i>But</i> i did dig up
six death certificates,

08:40.400 --> 08:42.900
one for each name
that the old man gave us.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.600
Now, they all died
within the last year.

08:45.700 --> 08:46.800
And get this...

08:46.900 --> 08:50.100
they all lived at a place
called the summer view senior living center.

08:50.200 --> 08:54.600
Now, while the certificates indicate that
they died of natural causes,

08:54.700 --> 08:56.700
they're all signed...

08:57.400 --> 08:59.200
by the same physician.

09:05.300 --> 09:09.300
All right, mr. Stiltskin,
i'm not ignoring you anymore.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.500
??

09:33.800 --> 09:36.200
- What are <i>you</i> doing here?
- You mean, in <i>my</i> office?

09:36.300 --> 09:37.800
Oh, sorry. Um...

09:37.900 --> 09:39.800
you're holding a delusional
old man in an interview room

09:39.900 --> 09:41.700
on a sunday afternoon...
yeah, i know that.

09:41.800 --> 09:44.200
You're wrapping that up, right,
sending everybody home until tomorrow?

09:44.300 --> 09:45.700
Uh, not exactly.

09:45.900 --> 09:48.100
Look, it's irritating, i know.

09:48.200 --> 09:49.100
But as it turns out,

09:49.200 --> 09:50.900
the dead guy actually <i>was</i> poisoned,

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
which means that we have
six more potential victims.

09:54.200 --> 09:55.400
So, get the death certificates.

09:55.500 --> 09:57.100
- That'll have a cause of death.
- We did that.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.400
They all supposedly died
of natural causes.

09:59.500 --> 10:02.500
But each death certificate
was signed by the same doctor.

10:02.600 --> 10:05.000
And when a doctor signs off
on a death certificate...

10:05.100 --> 10:06.100
there's no autopsy.

10:06.200 --> 10:07.400
Oh, my god, brenda,

10:07.500 --> 10:10.100
tell me you didn't just fax orders
for the exhumation of six bodies.

10:10.200 --> 10:11.600
Okay, i didn't.

10:14.200 --> 10:17.300
I just faxed the offer.
I have the confirmation in my hand.

10:17.400 --> 10:20.000
Well, nothing has come through.
Can you just do it again?

10:20.200 --> 10:22.800
Gary says doris could
get another offer any minute.

10:23.700 --> 10:25.000
And gary doesn't lie.

10:25.100 --> 10:27.700
It's there...
in the machine.

10:27.800 --> 10:28.900
It's <i>not.</i>

10:29.400 --> 10:31.400
All right. I'll try and send it
again later.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
For heaven's sake!

10:38.000 --> 10:39.500
Oh, chief,
if you can believe it,

10:39.600 --> 10:41.800
six of the dead bodies were cremated.

10:44.000 --> 10:44.900
Track down the ashes.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.300
Any family members give you a problem,
get a warrant.

10:47.400 --> 10:50.300
Uh, lieutenant tao, are we
signed to search the nursing home?

10:50.400 --> 10:51.400
Uh, not quite.

10:51.500 --> 10:54.500
The judge wants us to specify
the room numbers we want to look at.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.100
Oh.

11:02.700 --> 11:03.800
Ohh!

11:13.000 --> 11:15.900
We have determined that
the six people you named

11:16.000 --> 11:17.800
are, in fact, deceased.

11:18.300 --> 11:22.100
And they all lived at the same
nursing home prior to their deaths.

11:22.200 --> 11:24.000
Congratulations, young lady.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.400
You're that much closer
to finding out who i am.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.800
And that much closer to
treating you like a murderer,

11:28.900 --> 11:30.700
which seems to be what you want!

11:31.700 --> 11:33.000
Now,

11:33.100 --> 11:36.600
i have a warrant to search
mr. Kaplan's room,

11:36.700 --> 11:40.000
- but i need a room number.
- 308.

11:41.700 --> 11:44.200
Might you have a room
at this facility, as well?

11:45.700 --> 11:47.500
Find out for yourself.

11:51.300 --> 11:53.100
Say "cheese."

11:57.200 --> 11:58.500
Thank you.

12:07.600 --> 12:08.400
- Oh!
- Oh! Hi.

12:08.500 --> 12:09.500
Sergeant gabriel!

12:10.800 --> 12:11.600
What are you doing here?

12:11.700 --> 12:13.400
I thought you weren't
coming back until tomorrow.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.700
L-i spoke to daniels,

12:15.800 --> 12:18.000
and she said the squad was on call,

12:18.100 --> 12:22.500
and my, uh, suspension was up friday.

12:22.900 --> 12:25.500
Uh, i think this fax came for you.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.400
Oh, shoot!

12:27.500 --> 12:29.300
I faxed myself.

12:29.400 --> 12:32.700
- Chief, nursing home awaits!
- Oh, yes, thank you.

12:32.800 --> 12:36.300
Um, i just need to...
send a fax.

12:37.700 --> 12:38.900
Oh, sergeant gabriel...

12:41.400 --> 12:46.000
uh, if you could,
please babysit the suspect while i'm gone.

12:47.500 --> 12:48.600
Thank you.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.900
And there's no need to beat
information out of this old man.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.900
He's been confessing all morning.

13:08.900 --> 13:12.900
µøö·åæ

13:22.200 --> 13:23.700
can you sign these, please?

13:24.600 --> 13:26.200
What?
I <i>did</i> sign them.

13:26.300 --> 13:27.900
I faxed them to you before i left.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.400
You faxed me your warrant,

13:29.500 --> 13:31.200
which is how i knew where to find you.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.300
Oh, fritz.

13:34.500 --> 13:36.200
Oh, i'm sorry.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.700
Look, i'm dealing with
a potential serial killer here.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.600
Okay? A vicious murderer.

13:41.700 --> 13:44.100
Named rumplestiltskin.
Yes, i know.

13:44.200 --> 13:46.200
Here.
Just sign, please.

13:59.400 --> 14:00.700
Oh, hi, there.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.500
I'm nurse stiles.
You must be here for a tour.

14:09.300 --> 14:11.000
Oh, pardon me.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.700
Hi, i'm nurse townsend.
How can i help?

14:12.800 --> 14:15.100
Is bernard kaplan a resident here?

14:15.300 --> 14:17.700
Oh, my. I reported him missing today.
Is he okay?

14:17.800 --> 14:19.100
When did you notice he was gone?

14:19.200 --> 14:21.500
Early morning.
I was just finishing my rounds,

14:21.600 --> 14:25.000
and i noticed mr. Kaplan and
mr. Baxter's rooms were empty.

14:26.700 --> 14:29.400
- Is this mr. Baxter?
- Yes, it is... donald baxter!

14:29.500 --> 14:31.100
Are he and mr. Kaplan okay?

14:31.900 --> 14:33.300
Mr. Baxter's room number, please?

14:33.400 --> 14:35.400
Um, 309.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.100
Should i call the manager?

14:37.400 --> 14:38.700
You can if you like.

14:39.800 --> 14:40.900
Wait!
Wait, wait, wait.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.300
You've got to sign the visitors' book!

14:50.600 --> 14:52.100
There's nothing
in kaplan's room, chief.

14:52.200 --> 14:53.600
Oh.
Thank you.

14:54.100 --> 14:55.400
It kills me...

14:55.600 --> 14:59.500
white people pay all this money
to store their families in places like this.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.900
We throw some carpet in the garage,
everyone's welcome.

15:05.300 --> 15:06.400
Looking at these pictures,

15:06.500 --> 15:08.900
doesn't look like mr. Baxter
has any family at all.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
There's all kinds of research
on poisons here, chief.

15:12.500 --> 15:13.400
Wait a minute.

15:14.500 --> 15:17.800
Wait a minute.
I <i>do</i> recognize him.

15:18.100 --> 15:20.700
Yeah, baxter... donald baxter.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.300
He had the police beat on the newspaper

15:22.400 --> 15:24.500
when i was first starting out, chief.

15:25.900 --> 15:28.000
How did he end up here?

15:28.800 --> 15:31.600
Don't worry, lieutenant.
I'll come visit you.

15:34.200 --> 15:37.000
Excuse me.
Who's in charge here?

15:37.100 --> 15:39.600
Deputy chief brenda leigh johnson.
And you are...

15:39.700 --> 15:40.800
judd whaley.
I'm the manager.

15:40.900 --> 15:43.200
I really would have preferred
forewarning about your visit here.

15:43.300 --> 15:44.500
Well, i'm sorry about that,

15:44.600 --> 15:46.300
but when we call ahead
to execute a search warrant,

15:46.400 --> 15:47.600
we often find no one's home.

15:47.700 --> 15:49.000
Excuse me.
Step back, please, sir.

15:49.100 --> 15:51.000
Are mr. Kaplan and mr. Baxter okay?

15:51.100 --> 15:54.000
Mr. Kaplan is dead,
and mr. Baxter is in custody.

15:54.100 --> 15:55.400
Why is mr. Baxter in custody?

15:55.500 --> 15:57.700
He claims to have poisoned
mr. Kaplan.

15:58.100 --> 16:01.600
Oh, my god.
But...

16:02.900 --> 16:05.500
Iook, mr. Baxter can be troublesome,
a little paranoid at times,

16:05.600 --> 16:07.500
but he and mr. Kaplan were friends.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.400
Paranoid... in what way?

16:09.600 --> 16:12.300
Another one of his friends
passed away several months ago,

16:12.400 --> 16:14.300
and mr. Baxter took it very hard.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.800
He suffered what our doctor
diagnosed as a psychotic break,

16:16.900 --> 16:19.600
and so, occasionally,
mr. Baxter makes crazy accusations.

16:19.700 --> 16:20.700
Like what?

16:20.800 --> 16:24.100
Silly things, like claiming that
the staff is spying on him.

16:24.200 --> 16:27.600
Dr. Reisen put him on haldol,
an antipsychotic, and all indications...

16:27.700 --> 16:31.400
are these dr. Reisen's signatures
on all these death certificates?

16:31.500 --> 16:32.600
Yes, they are.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.400
Because if these six people
<i>were</i> poisoned,

16:35.500 --> 16:38.900
as mr. Baxter claims,
and dr. Reisen misdiagnosed them...

16:39.000 --> 16:40.800
nobody is poisoning people here...

16:40.900 --> 16:43.600
not mr. Baxter and certainly
no one on summer view's staff.

16:43.700 --> 16:44.700
Well, as it so happens,

16:44.800 --> 16:47.300
mr. Kaplan's body <i>does</i>
show signs of poisoning.

16:47.400 --> 16:48.800
- What?
- Ohh.

16:49.700 --> 16:51.000
My god.

16:51.100 --> 16:55.000
Do you think mr. Baxter would
poison someone to prove a point?

16:55.400 --> 16:57.900
As crazy as that may sound,
we can't take the chance.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.300
I'm afraid we can't allow mr. Baxter
to return to summer view.

17:00.400 --> 17:02.500
It's simply not safe for
the rest of our senior family.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.000
Also, as a matter of procedure,

17:04.099 --> 17:06.500
i'm gonna have to treat these
six other deaths as murders

17:06.599 --> 17:10.000
- until i can determine otherwise.
- Now, hold on.

17:10.099 --> 17:12.599
We run one of the finest facilities
in the country.

17:12.700 --> 17:14.599
Check our records,
our reputation.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.599
- Whatever it takes, i'll...
- chief...

17:16.900 --> 17:18.099
you need to see something.

17:18.599 --> 17:21.300
Mr. Whaley, we will certainly
take you up on your offer.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.200
That's my haldol.

17:27.400 --> 17:29.100
Aren't you supposed to be
taking this medication

17:29.200 --> 17:32.300
on a <i>daily</i> basis, mr. <i>baxter?</i>

17:33.400 --> 17:34.600
Yes.

17:34.700 --> 17:38.700
It's supposed to treat my
so-called "paranoid delusions."

17:38.800 --> 17:40.900
Unfortunately,
it doesn't work so well,

17:41.000 --> 17:42.800
since i never took it.

17:43.900 --> 17:45.200
So now you're ready to believe

17:45.300 --> 17:47.700
maybe i really did murder
those seven people?

17:47.800 --> 17:49.700
I'm starting to, yes.

17:49.900 --> 17:52.700
??

17:54.200 --> 17:55.400
Mr. Baxter, you understand

17:55.500 --> 17:57.000
it's a little hard
to take you seriously,

17:57.100 --> 17:58.800
especially since you've quit your meds

17:58.900 --> 18:01.700
and are most likely suffering
from psychotic delusions.

18:01.800 --> 18:04.700
The nursing home was using
those pills to shut me up

18:04.800 --> 18:06.100
because i know what's going on.

18:06.200 --> 18:07.400
I know they're killing people.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.300
Well, you do sound a little paranoid.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.500
Yeah, you see how that works?

18:11.600 --> 18:13.400
I know something bad is going on,

18:13.500 --> 18:17.000
so they say i'm delusional
and give me pills, drugs,

18:17.100 --> 18:19.000
to try and keep me quiet,

18:19.100 --> 18:21.800
knowing that, if i stop taking
the drugs and speak up,

18:21.900 --> 18:23.700
i'm gonna sound crazy.

18:25.900 --> 18:27.300
Why did you first tell us

18:27.400 --> 18:29.600
that it was <i>you</i>
who killed those people?

18:29.900 --> 18:32.000
It was the only way i could
get you to listen to me.

18:32.600 --> 18:33.900
And if it comes down to it,

18:34.000 --> 18:36.100
i'd rather go to prison
than back to that home.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.700
Well, you could have just
filed a complaint.

18:37.800 --> 18:40.400
I <i>did</i> file a complaint,
with the police,

18:40.500 --> 18:43.900
but no one took me seriously
until now.

18:45.100 --> 18:47.800
I'm sorry i wasn't more helpful before,

18:47.900 --> 18:50.100
but i needed to know
i could trust you...

18:50.700 --> 18:53.300
and i needed you to believe that
murders had been committed.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.000
Murders for which <i>you</i> are still
the most likely suspect.

18:56.100 --> 18:58.300
Bernie was my last best friend.
Why would i kill him?

18:58.400 --> 19:00.100
Well, if i'm to believe
the medical professionals,

19:00.200 --> 19:02.600
it's because you're out of your mind!

19:02.700 --> 19:05.200
And when i asked you
why you poisoned mr. Kaplan,

19:05.300 --> 19:07.800
you said it was to watch him die.

19:07.900 --> 19:10.800
- Now, that's just <i>crazy.</i>
- Exactly!

19:12.400 --> 19:14.700
All right,
for the sake of argument,

19:14.900 --> 19:19.200
what motive drove summer view
to murder seven of its paying customers?

19:19.300 --> 19:21.500
The customers weren't paying enough.

19:21.600 --> 19:22.900
Look into it.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.100
You'll find that each of the victims
had recently run out of money

19:26.200 --> 19:28.100
and had to go on medicaid.

19:28.200 --> 19:31.000
That's a massive loss of income
for summer view.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.300
Doesn't sound insane to me.

19:33.700 --> 19:37.300
In your room, we found
research materials on various poisons.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
I was trying to find out
how they were killing us off.

19:41.300 --> 19:45.300
I knew it was poison because
so many of my friends got sick so suddenly.

19:45.500 --> 19:49.100
But when poor bernie came down
with the same symp...

19:52.600 --> 19:55.700
i just wanted to try to get him some help.

19:58.100 --> 20:01.700
Why didn't you call family,
someone to take you to a hospital?

20:01.800 --> 20:03.700
I don't have any family left,

20:03.800 --> 20:07.700
and you can forget going to dr. Reisen
or nurse townsend for help.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.400
For all i know,
one of them was responsible.

20:21.700 --> 20:24.100
Got the tox screen back
for bernie kaplan...

20:24.700 --> 20:27.700
- positive for arsenic.
- Arsenic.

20:27.800 --> 20:31.400
Chief, we picked up nurse townsend.
She's on her way.

20:31.500 --> 20:34.200
We're still looking into this dr. Reisen.

20:34.600 --> 20:38.000
And, uh, commander taylor says
he's checking into baxter's claim

20:38.100 --> 20:39.500
that he filed a complaint.

20:39.600 --> 20:40.700
Thank you, sergeant.

20:44.200 --> 20:47.100
Uh, these files the manager gave us...

20:47.200 --> 20:50.500
i looked into summer view's
financial records for all seven victims,

20:50.600 --> 20:53.300
and baxter was right...
they were all on medicaid.

20:53.400 --> 20:54.300
Only problem...

20:54.400 --> 20:57.600
there are currently 11 other
residents at summer view

20:57.700 --> 21:01.000
who are also on medicaid,
several of them for years.

21:01.900 --> 21:04.800
So much for mr. Baxter's theory.
Anything else?

21:04.900 --> 21:07.000
Summer view seems like
a really efficient place...

21:07.100 --> 21:09.400
winner of several awards,
commendations,

21:09.500 --> 21:13.000
and monthly bonuses...
all based on occupancy.

21:13.100 --> 21:15.800
So it's hard to see why
they'd be killing off their customers.

21:16.800 --> 21:20.400
Okay, cremated remains
for five of the vics.

21:20.500 --> 21:21.600
What happened to number six?

21:21.700 --> 21:24.700
Uh, family lost him in a move.

21:26.100 --> 21:29.300
Uh, this is,
uh, joyce robinson.

21:29.400 --> 21:32.100
Her daughter said she never got around
to getting a proper urn.

21:34.100 --> 21:36.400
Marilyn roberts...
her niece says...

21:36.500 --> 21:37.800
yeah, i get the picture.

21:39.400 --> 21:40.900
Someone's family cared.

21:42.100 --> 21:46.300
Um, want to look a little more
closely at the name, chief?

21:48.700 --> 21:50.100
"Scrappy."

21:51.000 --> 21:54.200
They put mom's ashes
in the dog's urn.

21:55.100 --> 21:56.500
It's not funny, flynn.

21:57.400 --> 22:00.700
How nice to see everybody
spending time together off the clock.

22:00.800 --> 22:04.200
This is some kind of team morale-building
exercise, right?

22:04.300 --> 22:06.500
?? Actually, chief pope,
we may be looking at some overtime here,

22:06.600 --> 22:07.600
and i'm sorry about that.

22:07.700 --> 22:10.900
No. No overtime... period.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.700
And as for your suspect,
either charge him or send him home.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.600
I'm not paying for him
to spend the night here.

22:15.700 --> 22:18.100
I'm also not shelling out
thousands of dollars

22:18.200 --> 22:20.100
for you to exhume six dead bodies

22:20.200 --> 22:22.000
based on the word of a senile old man.

22:22.100 --> 22:23.900
Okay?
So forget about that.

22:24.300 --> 22:26.000
Good night. Bye.
Let's go.

22:26.600 --> 22:27.500
Uh, wait.

22:27.800 --> 22:30.600
Just... just a second.
Um, just one second.

22:30.700 --> 22:33.800
How about this?
Um, sign off on our overtime today,

22:33.900 --> 22:37.700
and i promise, i won't dig up
any of those other dead bodies.

22:37.800 --> 22:40.100
We'll just find some other way
to solve this thing.

22:42.200 --> 22:43.000
Deal.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.200
But i'm holding you to that.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.300
Oh, and, here,
i almost forgot...

22:50.400 --> 22:52.600
a, uh, counteroffer on a house

22:52.700 --> 22:56.600
that you are apparently bidding on
was faxed to <i>my</i> office.

22:57.200 --> 22:59.400
Looks like it's more
than the asking price.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.100
What?

23:02.400 --> 23:04.000
Um chief...

23:04.800 --> 23:06.300
what would you like me to do
with these?

23:06.400 --> 23:09.800
I mean, they're obviously a dead end.

23:09.800 --> 23:13.500
Uh, lieutenant tao,
isn't arsenic a heavy metal?

23:13.900 --> 23:17.000
Which means it would show up
on a chem screen of cremated remains.

23:17.100 --> 23:20.500
Right, so, want to have those
ashes analyzed asap, please?

23:20.600 --> 23:21.400
Thank you.

23:23.200 --> 23:25.000
Chief, got a minute?

23:26.500 --> 23:29.700
Seems the old guy did try
reaching out to us for help.

23:30.000 --> 23:30.900
Thank you.

23:33.600 --> 23:35.900
"After receiving numerous
letters to the department,

23:36.000 --> 23:40.100
"detective gordon was dispatched
to question the complainant, donald baxter."

23:40.200 --> 23:41.600
According to that report,

23:41.700 --> 23:44.200
gordon found baxter uncooperative.

23:44.400 --> 23:49.100
In fact, the old guy was more interested
in asking questions than answering them.

23:49.200 --> 23:50.500
It seemed like a crank,

23:50.600 --> 23:53.700
so detective gordon dumped
his complaint in the round file.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.200
I'm sorry...
the round file?

23:56.000 --> 23:57.100
The trash.

23:59.100 --> 24:00.500
But you know what, chief?

24:00.500 --> 24:02.700
We get this kind of stuff
all the time.

24:03.100 --> 24:05.200
It's hard enough staying on top
of the crimes we find,

24:05.300 --> 24:07.500
much less the ones people make up.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
And the guy was...
come on, you know.

24:10.100 --> 24:11.700
I know exactly what happened.

24:12.900 --> 24:15.500
Mr. Baxter's old and difficult,

24:15.600 --> 24:17.900
and because of that,
he was dismissed out of hand.

24:18.600 --> 24:20.200
And i know that that's what happened,

24:20.300 --> 24:23.000
because that's exactly
what i've been trying to do to him myself.

24:27.500 --> 24:30.900
But we didn't just dump
a complaint in the trash...

24:31.500 --> 24:33.600
a few more human beings
went with it.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Thank you.

24:38.700 --> 24:41.100
Were you close with mr. Kaplan?

24:41.700 --> 24:44.300
I am close with <i>all</i> our residents.

24:44.500 --> 24:48.700
Oh, so you remember these folks, then?

24:52.200 --> 24:55.000
Oh, mrs. Roberts...
she was a sweet lady.

24:55.100 --> 24:57.200
She always talked about
her late husband.

24:57.300 --> 24:59.100
She used to say
he had a great head of hair.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.500
And then she started to forget
she'd ever been married.

25:03.800 --> 25:05.700
Oh, poor mr. Hepfner...

25:06.300 --> 25:07.700
after his daughter passed away,

25:07.800 --> 25:11.300
he just sat and stared out the window
for a whole year before <i>he</i> died.

25:12.400 --> 25:15.900
- You cared about them.
- Yes. It's my job.

25:17.600 --> 25:19.700
Getting old is scary.

25:20.200 --> 25:22.100
Some of our residents
lose everything...

25:22.200 --> 25:24.000
family, friends, money.

25:25.100 --> 25:27.900
They run out of life
before they run out of time.

25:28.800 --> 25:31.100
Did any of these people
seem sick before they died?

25:31.200 --> 25:33.000
Yes.
They all had the same disease...

25:33.100 --> 25:34.400
it's called "old age."

25:34.500 --> 25:36.600
Listen, people die at summer view.

25:36.700 --> 25:38.900
We don't jump to murder
as the cause.

25:39.100 --> 25:40.700
Who has access to their drugs?

25:40.800 --> 25:43.300
- The nursing staff.
- And the doctor, dr. Reisen.

25:43.400 --> 25:45.100
Do you know where he is?
I've tried to contact him.

25:45.200 --> 25:48.300
On vacation...
hawaii for a week, with his wife.

25:48.800 --> 25:49.700
Oh, you don't think...

25:49.800 --> 25:52.300
dr. Reisen had nothing to do
with the day-to-day care.

25:52.400 --> 25:55.400
- I supervised the meds.
- Any chance drugs get mixed up?

25:56.200 --> 25:57.900
We do our very best, ms. Johnson,

25:58.000 --> 25:59.700
with patients
who forget to take their meds,

25:59.800 --> 26:02.700
misplace their pills, and sometimes,
simply won't cooperate.

26:02.800 --> 26:05.200
Do you think that mr. Baxter
poisoned mr. Kaplan himself?

26:05.300 --> 26:06.700
I really don't know.

26:07.200 --> 26:08.800
Whatever mr. Baxter's claiming...

26:08.900 --> 26:10.800
this nonsense that we had
something to do with it...

26:10.900 --> 26:12.000
that's not true.

26:12.500 --> 26:16.800
Mr. Baxter burned his bridges
with summer view and with his son...

26:16.900 --> 26:18.300
wait. Wait.

26:18.400 --> 26:20.200
- His son?
- Yes.

26:22.900 --> 26:24.300
Would you like to have a seat, sir?

26:25.800 --> 26:28.300
- Is my father dead?
- No. He's not.

26:29.100 --> 26:30.200
Thank god.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.400
So, what, uh, is he absent
without leave again?

26:35.900 --> 26:38.000
You need me to take him
back to the nursing home?

26:38.100 --> 26:41.600
Actually, uh, summer view is refusing
to take your father back.

26:42.400 --> 26:44.100
He's made some accusations
towards the staff...

26:44.200 --> 26:46.500
this isn't about
the poisoning thing again, is it?

26:46.600 --> 26:49.600
Listen, it's nothing.
Dad used to be a reporter.

26:49.700 --> 26:52.600
He's just desperate for one
more story, that's all.

26:52.700 --> 26:54.300
Well, some of that story seems to be true.

26:54.400 --> 26:57.700
Several people at summer view
may have been slipped some arsenic.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.500
Seriously?
Wait.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.800
Is... is dad under arrest?

27:02.900 --> 27:05.100
- Should he be?
- Of course not.

27:05.200 --> 27:07.300
Look, he's a nuisance,
that's all.

27:07.400 --> 27:09.600
He spent his entire career
questioning people.

27:09.700 --> 27:11.100
It's who he is.

27:11.900 --> 27:13.900
- Are you close to your father?
- Why?

27:14.200 --> 27:16.700
You're not, like, suggesting
i should take him home with me, are you?

27:16.800 --> 27:18.500
'Cause i know it sounds cold,

27:18.600 --> 27:22.300
but my life is just not conducive
to dealing with his baggage right now.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.800
- And when is it conducive?
- Excuse me?

27:24.900 --> 27:27.300
Uh, according to summer view's
visitors' log,

27:27.400 --> 27:29.600
which everyone has to sign in to enter,

27:29.700 --> 27:32.300
you haven't dropped by to see
your father in over a year.

27:32.400 --> 27:33.200
And i was wondering

27:33.300 --> 27:34.700
- if there was some reason.
- What's it to you

27:34.800 --> 27:36.400
when i see my dad?

27:36.500 --> 27:39.500
I got three kids,
an ex-wife in rehab.

27:39.600 --> 27:41.200
And the last time i had
the old guy over for dinner,

27:41.300 --> 27:44.800
he got my 11-year-old son
to help him get online...

27:45.000 --> 27:47.900
to find pictures of people
who died from cyanide.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.200
I don't need that
kind of crap in my life.

27:50.300 --> 27:54.500
Look, i was only asking about
your father

27:54.800 --> 27:56.800
to see if you had some reason
to be afraid of him.

27:56.900 --> 27:59.400
Afraid of him?
I hardly know him, okay?

27:59.600 --> 28:03.100
He spent my entire childhood
chasing after newspaper headlines.

28:03.200 --> 28:04.500
Look, i got by without him then,

28:04.600 --> 28:07.000
he can get by without me now.

28:07.200 --> 28:09.900
Speaking of which, i need to go.
I left my kids with the babysitter.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Excuse me.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.600
Your dad's here.

28:16.200 --> 28:19.500
Would you like to pop your head in
and say "hello" before you head out?

28:23.400 --> 28:25.000
Maybe some other time.

28:30.800 --> 28:32.600
I guess mr. Baxter was right.

28:33.200 --> 28:34.800
He has no family.

28:34.900 --> 28:36.200
So, what do you do

28:36.300 --> 28:39.700
if you run out of friends
and family and money?

28:41.000 --> 28:42.900
It's a reason to kill yourself,

28:44.100 --> 28:46.500
but is it a motive for murder?

28:49.500 --> 28:50.900
Look, chief, um...

28:51.800 --> 28:53.600
unless you're gonna book
the miserable old guy,

28:53.700 --> 28:55.400
i could take him home with me
for the night.

28:55.500 --> 28:56.700
It's no problem.

28:58.400 --> 28:59.400
Your call.

29:02.700 --> 29:04.200
Treat him like a witness...

29:05.300 --> 29:07.000
but watch him like a killer.

29:30.800 --> 29:33.300
Let me tell you something...
i know women like doris.

29:33.400 --> 29:35.400
She's emotionally attached
to the house.

29:35.500 --> 29:36.600
So a situation like this,

29:36.700 --> 29:39.000
you have got to do everything you can

29:39.100 --> 29:41.500
to sell her on who you are.

29:41.600 --> 29:44.100
So, in the letter that you write
with the new offer,

29:44.200 --> 29:46.300
you don't just raise the price
a little bit...

29:46.600 --> 29:48.500
you talk about the two of you
as a couple...

29:48.600 --> 29:50.900
how you see yourselves
living in the house,

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
raising a family just like she did.

29:53.100 --> 29:54.700
Even throw in
a picture of the cat.

29:54.800 --> 29:56.800
And you offer to help her out
on the terms.

29:56.900 --> 29:59.200
She will jump all over it,
all right? Trust me.

29:59.300 --> 30:01.900
- Gary doesn't lie.
- We help her out on terms?

30:02.000 --> 30:04.800
All right, look,
escrow's one to two months.

30:04.900 --> 30:05.900
Today's the 6th.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.300
You give our old lady
a 20-day escrow.

30:08.300 --> 30:09.200
End of the month...

30:09.300 --> 30:11.600
doris has your money
in her hot little hands.

30:11.700 --> 30:13.200
So do you, right?

30:13.800 --> 30:14.700
Excuse me?

30:14.800 --> 30:17.700
You move another house,
especially from someone you listed,

30:17.800 --> 30:19.500
and you get cash coming <i>and</i> going.

30:19.700 --> 30:20.700
Isn't that right?

30:21.800 --> 30:23.700
Maybe you had to move
another unit or two

30:23.800 --> 30:26.000
by the end of the month
to hit your bonus.

30:26.500 --> 30:27.500
Is that it?

30:30.000 --> 30:33.400
That's got nothing to do
with anything. Please.

30:33.500 --> 30:36.100
Gary doesn't lie.
Mm-hmm.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.500
What? What?
Where you going?

30:41.600 --> 30:42.900
It's not just the visitor's log...

30:43.000 --> 30:45.900
it's the dates.
It's the dates!

30:47.700 --> 30:48.500
Detective sanchez,

30:48.600 --> 30:50.800
may i see those death
certificates again, please?

30:54.200 --> 30:55.200
Thank you.

30:58.500 --> 31:00.500
Detective daniels,
were you able to...

31:00.900 --> 31:03.400
track down that manager
at summer view?

31:03.500 --> 31:05.400
Judd whaley...
he's on his way.

31:05.500 --> 31:07.900
Good.
Uh, lieutenant flynn,

31:08.200 --> 31:09.900
if you wouldn't mind
asking lieutenant provenza

31:10.000 --> 31:12.200
- to bring the suspect back in, please?
- I'm on it, chief.

31:12.300 --> 31:14.200
Has anyone seen lieutenant... tao!

31:14.300 --> 31:16.000
Got the chem results on those ashes.

31:16.100 --> 31:17.100
You're gonna want to take a look.

31:17.200 --> 31:18.900
I will. Thank you.
Um...

31:20.000 --> 31:21.900
uh, detective daniels,
if you would, please,

31:22.000 --> 31:24.700
bring sergeant gabriel up
to speed on summer view's financials.

31:24.800 --> 31:25.800
Thank you.

31:36.200 --> 31:37.500
Sleep with one eye open?

31:37.600 --> 31:40.900
Well, he had me up all hours
playing yahtzee.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.000
He's a freak for the dice.

31:43.200 --> 31:44.300
Really? Who won?

31:46.900 --> 31:48.800
What's whaley doing here?!

31:48.900 --> 31:51.200
Just have a few things
to clear up, mr. Baxter.

31:51.300 --> 31:52.700
He'll accuse me of everything.

31:52.800 --> 31:54.400
Well, we'll see about that, won't we?

31:54.500 --> 31:56.800
Buzz, would you please give me
one of your legal pads?

31:57.300 --> 31:58.300
Thank you.

31:59.500 --> 32:01.600
You keep insisting there's a story here.

32:01.900 --> 32:03.100
You're the reporter.

32:03.900 --> 32:05.400
Listen to what mr. Whaley
has to say,

32:05.500 --> 32:06.700
write it all down,

32:06.800 --> 32:09.000
and i'll be back
to talk with you in a minute.

32:25.600 --> 32:26.800
You ready, sergeant?

32:27.700 --> 32:29.900
Yes, ma'am,
completely ready.

32:35.200 --> 32:38.100
Mr. Whaley, thank you <i>so</i> much
for coming in.

32:38.200 --> 32:39.100
Certainly.

32:39.200 --> 32:40.500
Why don't you have a seat?

32:41.600 --> 32:44.000
The reason i called you in is,

32:44.100 --> 32:46.400
i think it would be
in everyone's best interest

32:46.500 --> 32:50.000
if you were to allow mr. Baxter
back in your facility for a while.

32:50.700 --> 32:51.500
Are you serious?

32:51.600 --> 32:53.300
What's she doing?
I can't go back there.

32:53.400 --> 32:55.000
Shh, shh!
We need to hear this.

32:55.100 --> 32:56.500
He really has nowhere else to go.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.300
- His family...
- look, ms. Johnson,

32:58.400 --> 32:59.800
there are other patients in our care,

32:59.900 --> 33:01.500
and if mr. Baxter was poisoning people,

33:01.600 --> 33:04.600
well, for one thing,
it's a liability nightmare.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.800
I certainly understand
your concern, mr. Whaley,

33:06.900 --> 33:10.100
especially since summer view has
quite a reputation to uphold.

33:10.600 --> 33:13.900
Uh, two awards for state excellence,

33:14.000 --> 33:17.500
three commendations
by the california seniors association,

33:17.600 --> 33:19.400
and eight bonuses,

33:19.600 --> 33:22.600
based upon your occupancy
within the last year alone.

33:23.200 --> 33:27.600
All this while coping with
the extreme loneliness of your residents,

33:27.800 --> 33:29.600
which is something that
mr. Baxter had in common

33:29.700 --> 33:32.100
with the seven people
he claims were murdered.

33:32.200 --> 33:36.000
And i've noticed that not only
had our victims run out of money,

33:36.100 --> 33:39.400
but they had also,
according to your visitors' log,

33:39.500 --> 33:42.300
exhausted their supply of guests.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.800
No one came to see them anymore.

33:45.200 --> 33:48.900
That happens to many more of our residents
than one might like to believe.

33:49.600 --> 33:52.100
Well, here's something
a bit more unusual.

33:53.000 --> 33:57.100
This is all that's left
of five of our victims.

33:57.200 --> 34:01.600
The sixth was lost
in a family move.

34:02.500 --> 34:05.800
This is a testament to
how badly they were ignored.

34:06.500 --> 34:07.800
Odd, isn't it?

34:08.000 --> 34:12.000
People who have guests, live.
People who don't, die.

34:12.100 --> 34:14.600
Well, the effect of our emotions
on the physical body

34:14.699 --> 34:16.100
is still a mysterious process,

34:16.199 --> 34:17.199
but believe it or not,

34:17.300 --> 34:20.300
some of these people likely
passed away from depression.

34:20.500 --> 34:21.800
I believe not, mr. Whaley,

34:21.900 --> 34:23.900
but then,
i have an advantage over you,

34:24.000 --> 34:26.699
because you can test for arsenic
in cremated remains.

34:26.800 --> 34:30.900
And what we have here are five
containers of poisonous ash.

34:32.600 --> 34:34.199
My god.

34:34.900 --> 34:37.199
Oh, but you would never ask us
to take mr. Baxter back

34:37.300 --> 34:38.900
if you thought he was
responsible for this.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.300
No, i wouldn't.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.699
But i don't think
mr. Baxter <i>is</i> responsible,

34:42.800 --> 34:43.900
because he doesn't have a motive.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.699
What he does have is a lawsuit,

34:46.699 --> 34:49.300
because he brought these poisonings
to summer view's attention,

34:49.400 --> 34:52.600
and <i>you</i> attempted to drug him
with antipsychotics.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.500
Well, that was dr. Reisen's diagnosis.

34:54.600 --> 34:57.600
I don't prescribe drugs.
I'm not a doctor. I'm a manager.

34:57.900 --> 34:59.700
The manager who collected the bonuses

34:59.800 --> 35:01.900
based on how many rooms are occupied

35:02.000 --> 35:04.200
during the first five days
of every month.

35:04.300 --> 35:08.900
Can you, uh, see a pattern
developing here, sir?

35:09.500 --> 35:12.000
You see, it's really...
it's really quite remarkable,

35:12.100 --> 35:15.400
because all of your abandoned
medicaid patients...

35:15.500 --> 35:18.400
they all died in the fourth week
of every month,

35:18.500 --> 35:21.300
giving you time to rebook their rooms
with full-paying clients

35:21.400 --> 35:23.100
from your waiting list.

35:23.700 --> 35:24.800
Why would i do that?

35:24.900 --> 35:26.500
Well, according to your files,

35:26.600 --> 35:29.900
every month that summer view
has an occupancy rate below...

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
...3%, you collect a $2,500 bonus.

35:33.100 --> 35:35.100
You had eight of them last year.

35:35.300 --> 35:36.800
Now, i'm thinking that maybe you got lucky

35:36.900 --> 35:39.400
and someone died naturally
on your timetable.

35:39.800 --> 35:45.800
But, still, you poisoned
7 people for under $20,000.

35:46.300 --> 35:46.900
Sergeant.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.500
Mr. Whaley, you have the right
to remain silent.

35:49.600 --> 35:51.000
- Anything you say...
- she's good.

35:51.100 --> 35:52.600
Yeah, she's all right,
i guess.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.000
I taught her most of this.

35:55.100 --> 35:57.300
...one will be appointed to you
by the state.

35:57.400 --> 35:58.900
Have you heard and understood
these rights?

35:59.000 --> 36:00.200
You're misrepresenting everything.

36:00.300 --> 36:03.800
We have warrants out as we speak
to search your home, your office, and your car.

36:03.900 --> 36:06.400
All i have to do is find
the arsenic...

36:06.600 --> 36:10.200
just one little package of rough on rats,
and it's gonna look very bad for you.

36:10.300 --> 36:13.500
Mr. Whaley,
absent your explanation,

36:13.600 --> 36:16.900
i'm gonna have to arrest you
on seven counts of murder in the first degree,

36:17.000 --> 36:20.700
which is a very different crime
from mercy killings.

36:23.300 --> 36:25.100
You know,
nurse townsend told us

36:25.200 --> 36:27.800
that these people were sick and unhappy.

36:28.800 --> 36:32.900
It must have been very hard
to watch them suffer day after day.

36:34.600 --> 36:36.000
They wanted to die.

36:37.300 --> 36:40.100
There was no quality of life
for these people, ms. Johnson.

36:42.600 --> 36:45.700
Three of them had a form
of dementia and nowhere to go.

36:46.000 --> 36:50.100
Mr. Kaplan, well, he was suffering
from congestive heart disease.

36:51.200 --> 36:52.800
And if you'll just...
just...

36:54.500 --> 36:56.600
just pause and reflect for a moment.

36:57.400 --> 36:59.900
By controlling the schedule
of when these poor people expired...

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
which is all i ever did,

37:01.100 --> 37:02.900
making sure they didn't die
between the 1st and the 5th,

37:03.000 --> 37:04.400
which would have been pointless...

37:04.700 --> 37:08.400
by managing their deaths, i was able to
maximize the value of their passing

37:08.500 --> 37:12.100
by creating room for people
who could better benefit from our service.

37:12.400 --> 37:14.300
People with larger bank accounts.

37:14.400 --> 37:17.200
Look, i'm not the person
who turned old age into a business.

37:17.300 --> 37:19.400
And honestly,
the bonuses i received,

37:19.500 --> 37:22.700
as you pointed out,
were <i>very</i> small.

37:23.300 --> 37:24.400
Mr. Whaley...

37:25.800 --> 37:27.600
you <i>poisoned</i> these people.

37:27.700 --> 37:29.200
Well, that's one way
of looking at it, yes,

37:29.300 --> 37:32.100
but, really, who cares?

37:33.300 --> 37:35.500
Their families obviously don't.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.800
These old people were dead already.

37:37.900 --> 37:39.400
All i did was make it official.

37:39.500 --> 37:43.100
And by doing it my way,
everybody got what they wanted.

37:43.200 --> 37:46.800
So i repeat... who cares?

37:48.400 --> 37:51.700
Unfortunately for you...
mr. Baxter.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.400
Well, you have a point there.

37:58.700 --> 38:00.100
So, how about this?

38:01.700 --> 38:05.600
I will refrain from expediting

38:05.700 --> 38:11.000
the terminal phase of any
future resident's stay at summer view,

38:11.100 --> 38:14.500
and mr. Baxter can come back
and stay with us for as long as he likes.

38:14.600 --> 38:17.700
<i>And</i> if he agrees not to sue,

38:18.200 --> 38:20.000
we'll give him a year for free.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.800
While that is a very generous
offer, mr. Whaley,

38:24.900 --> 38:28.000
i'm afraid the state of california
would reduce <i>my</i> efficiency rating

38:28.100 --> 38:31.600
if i didn't arrest you
on seven counts of murder in the first degree,

38:31.700 --> 38:33.600
- which is what i'm doing right now.
- What?

38:33.800 --> 38:35.000
But why are you...

38:35.200 --> 38:37.600
l-i just explained to you.

38:37.800 --> 38:40.100
Now, now,
hold on one moment!

38:40.300 --> 38:44.000
I thought you said mercy killing and
first-degree murder were very different crimes!

38:44.100 --> 38:46.700
They are, but the punishment
for both is exactly the same.

38:46.800 --> 38:50.800
Are you actually talking about
putting me in prison?

38:50.900 --> 38:51.700
Don't worry.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.100
It's not that different
from summer view, really.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.200
You have to sign in
to visit people,

38:56.300 --> 38:58.400
friends and relatives
tend to forget you exist,

38:58.500 --> 39:02.200
and at some point, the state of california
might just put you out of your misery.

39:03.500 --> 39:05.700
Well, i certainly don't deserve <i>this.</i>

39:06.300 --> 39:07.800
You're right, mr. Whaley.

39:08.400 --> 39:09.700
Unfortunately...

39:10.600 --> 39:12.800
??

39:32.900 --> 39:34.300
Did you write it all down?

39:34.800 --> 39:36.700
Well, you gave me an exclusive.

39:37.500 --> 39:40.000
I didn't know if i had
another story in me.

39:40.800 --> 39:42.500
At least, this way,

39:42.700 --> 39:45.600
people will read bernie's obituary,
won't they?

39:45.700 --> 39:47.700
Well, i'm sure they will, mr. Baxter.

39:49.200 --> 39:52.700
Would you like us to arrange
someplace for you to go,

39:53.300 --> 39:56.000
or would you like money
for a hotel room?

39:56.100 --> 39:59.800
Well, really, i was hoping
i could go back to summer view.

40:00.300 --> 40:01.000
What?

40:01.100 --> 40:04.200
Well, i don't have to worry about
being poisoned anymore,

40:05.200 --> 40:08.400
and it really is the only home
i have, ms. Johnson.

40:09.700 --> 40:10.500
Oh.

40:12.400 --> 40:16.200
And the summer view
senior living corporation

40:16.300 --> 40:20.300
just might feel some sense
of financial obligation.

40:20.400 --> 40:23.900
I could wind up living there
scot-free till the day i die.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.900
Ah, the golden years.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.100
Rent-free for the first time
since i sold my house.

40:31.200 --> 40:32.300
House.

40:33.200 --> 40:35.600
Oh, my.
I almost forgot.

40:35.700 --> 40:37.300
Um, lieutenant provenza,

40:37.400 --> 40:38.400
- could you please...
- i've got it covered, chief.

40:38.500 --> 40:39.200
Thank you.

40:39.500 --> 40:42.900
- Here we go, mr. Baxter.
- And good luck, mr. Baxter.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
- You too, young lady.
- Thank you.

40:45.300 --> 40:46.600
You know,

40:46.700 --> 40:49.200
if there'd been a great-looking broad
in the department back

40:49.300 --> 40:51.000
when this was my beat,

40:51.100 --> 40:53.100
??

41:02.900 --> 41:06.700
Gary evans dropped your letter by earlier.

41:07.000 --> 41:11.200
I can't begin to tell you
how much it means to me

41:11.300 --> 41:14.600
knowing you feel so strongly
about the house.

41:16.700 --> 41:18.000
It's all lies.

41:18.200 --> 41:20.800
- I'm sorry?
- In our letter, we made stuff up

41:20.900 --> 41:23.100
because we wanted you to like us.

41:23.700 --> 41:24.900
We took advantage of you,

41:25.000 --> 41:27.700
and it was a terrible,
dreadful thing to do,

41:27.800 --> 41:30.000
and i'm so, so sorry.

41:30.100 --> 41:31.800
But gary evans...

41:31.900 --> 41:33.500
gary lies.

41:34.900 --> 41:38.100
So you're...
pulling your offer?

41:38.900 --> 41:41.000
It just wouldn't feel right.

41:41.100 --> 41:44.900
I'd be worried about
how you were spending your retirement.

41:45.000 --> 41:49.000
So, yes, i'm... i'm...
i'm pulling the offer.

41:51.200 --> 41:54.600
- Oh, but that's wonderful, dear!
- Why?

41:54.700 --> 41:55.700
I hate to say this,

41:55.800 --> 41:59.800
but i was never gonna sell
this house in a million years!

42:00.200 --> 42:03.400
- Excuse me?
- No, that's why i upped the price.

42:03.500 --> 42:06.800
I didn't think i'd get an offer
so soon in <i>this</i> market.

42:07.100 --> 42:09.000
L-i don't understand.

42:09.100 --> 42:11.200
Well, when my husband died...

42:11.800 --> 42:14.300
i was a little lonely.

42:14.600 --> 42:17.900
It's so difficult to meet
people in Los Angeles.

42:18.900 --> 42:22.000
I tried going to a.a.
For a little while,

42:22.100 --> 42:25.400
but it turns out you have
to quit drinking completely,

42:25.800 --> 42:28.100
which seemed extreme.

42:29.700 --> 42:32.700
So you put your house on the market...

42:32.800 --> 42:35.000
...to have a little company, yes.

42:35.400 --> 42:36.900
Nothing serious

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
just nice people like you & Fritz

42:41.100 --> 42:43.000
stopping by

42:43.100 --> 42:45.300
admiring the house

42:46.800 --> 42:51.100
i...

42:51.200 --> 42:52.500
i have a lot of chocolate chips cookies left

42:52.600 --> 42:55.900
and i will give you a bag or two if
you promised not to tell Gary...

43:13.600 --> 43:14.900
Hi Mama

43:15.900 --> 43:17.700
No, everything's fine

43:18.500 --> 43:20.100
I miss you too.

43:21.100 --> 43:24.500
Actually i was hoping maybe you & dad
come for visiting

43:26.100 --> 43:28.900
No, we have yet to find a place yet but

43:30.200 --> 43:31.800
We'll make around

43:32.305 --> 43:38.483
