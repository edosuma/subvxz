00:40.106 --> 00:41.307
[wind howling]

00:50.249 --> 00:51.384
[panting]

00:51.417 --> 00:52.718
[boy 1] Go ahead. Run!

00:52.751 --> 00:54.420
But when we catch you,

00:54.453 --> 00:56.322
we're going to break
those skinny legs of yours.

00:56.355 --> 00:59.092
[boy 2] And stomp
on your ugly face!

01:00.159 --> 01:01.360
Leave him alone!

01:01.393 --> 01:03.063
He didn't do anything to you.

01:03.863 --> 01:05.065
[panting]

01:12.238 --> 01:13.273
[gasps]

01:19.211 --> 01:20.180
[groans]

01:21.413 --> 01:24.250
I said, leave him alone.

01:24.783 --> 01:25.785
Bitch!

01:27.153 --> 01:28.254
[groans]

01:34.894 --> 01:37.330
I'll hit you again,
Dimitri Romanovich.

01:39.165 --> 01:40.700
If you weren't a girl...

01:41.634 --> 01:42.635
Come on.

01:51.210 --> 01:52.478
[sighs]

01:52.511 --> 01:53.546
Are they gone?

01:57.650 --> 02:00.219
I can't keep saving you
like this, Somishka.

02:00.252 --> 02:01.487
You have to stop running,

02:01.520 --> 02:03.156
and find the courage
to face them.

02:04.356 --> 02:07.193
It's... It's not
like that, Svetlana.

02:07.226 --> 02:10.395
I didn't run
because I was afraid of them.

02:10.429 --> 02:12.699
I ran because I was afraid
to hurt them.

02:17.469 --> 02:19.205
Have I ever lied
to you, Svetlana?

02:21.473 --> 02:22.475
[metal creaking]

02:23.876 --> 02:25.445
[gasps]

02:33.986 --> 02:36.489
How is this possible?

02:38.324 --> 02:39.926
[thudding]

02:39.959 --> 02:41.594
I don't know.

02:41.627 --> 02:44.197
Something has been
happening inside me,

02:44.230 --> 02:45.398
for weeks now.

02:47.866 --> 02:49.502
[gasps]

02:49.535 --> 02:50.737
Something incredible.

02:51.971 --> 02:53.773
[exclaims]

02:53.806 --> 02:54.807
[wind howling]

03:12.258 --> 03:15.261
Such incredible powers,
Somishka.

03:16.829 --> 03:18.698
You have to give them
to the State.

03:19.932 --> 03:21.301
The people need you.

04:31.070 --> 04:34.073
Extraordinary reports
coming out of the Soviet Union.

04:34.106 --> 04:35.708
Tales of a being,

04:35.741 --> 04:38.577
allegedly alien in origin
with powers and abilities

04:38.610 --> 04:40.646
far beyond those of mortal men.

04:40.679 --> 04:43.082
[music playing]

04:43.115 --> 04:46.419
This footage
released by the Russians
appears to show

04:46.452 --> 04:47.787
the Soviet Superman in action.

04:51.423 --> 04:53.359
If true,

04:53.392 --> 04:55.328
this could be the beginning
of a new kind of arms race.

05:04.937 --> 05:07.673
This is undoubtedly
mere propaganda

05:07.706 --> 05:10.376
tailored to send
ripples of fear into the West.

05:11.410 --> 05:13.346
And in these treacherous times,

05:13.379 --> 05:15.581
fear is something
we must never surrender to.

05:15.614 --> 05:17.016
[music ends]

05:17.049 --> 05:19.452
This is George Taylor,
saying good night,

05:19.485 --> 05:20.886
and may your tomorrows all--

05:20.919 --> 05:23.656
[radio playing indistinctly]

05:23.689 --> 05:25.091
As I said, Mr. President,

05:25.124 --> 05:26.726
I anticipated this.

05:26.759 --> 05:28.627
Of course,
I understand your concern,

05:28.660 --> 05:31.864
but I assure you,
the Luthor Company
has this under control.

05:31.897 --> 05:34.066
We'll find out soon enough
if he's real.

05:34.099 --> 05:36.769
All I need is
a hundred technicians,
$20 million,

05:36.802 --> 05:38.871
and permission to drop
a satellite on Metropolis.

05:38.904 --> 05:40.706
[man over phone]
Drop a satellite on Metropolis?

05:40.739 --> 05:42.007
Eisenhower.

05:42.040 --> 05:43.709
Are you out of your damn mind?

05:43.742 --> 05:46.445
[continues indistinctly
over phone]

05:46.478 --> 05:47.747
I have to go, sir.

05:47.780 --> 05:49.582
Something more urgent
just came up.

05:49.615 --> 05:50.716
You can't--

05:50.749 --> 05:53.386
I'd say extremely urgent.

05:54.486 --> 05:55.588
[moans]

05:57.723 --> 05:59.024
[Stalin] We gather here today

05:59.057 --> 06:01.961
to celebrate
a glorious achievement.

06:01.994 --> 06:06.499
The largest hydroelectric
station in the world.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.467
-Ten thousand
of our bravest...
-[camera shutters clicking]

06:08.500 --> 06:09.869
...strongest men

06:09.902 --> 06:13.005
worked ceaselessly
to construct it.

06:13.038 --> 06:15.841
But even with
their sweat and toil,

06:15.874 --> 06:18.177
this dam would never
have been completed

06:18.210 --> 06:21.447
in so short a time
if not for the efforts

06:21.480 --> 06:24.817
of a truly extraordinary
young man...

06:24.850 --> 06:27.453
A young man
I have come to look upon

06:27.486 --> 06:29.889
as both a great Soviet hero

06:29.922 --> 06:31.424
and a son.

06:31.924 --> 06:33.058
Comrades,

06:33.091 --> 06:34.127
I give you...

06:35.093 --> 06:36.128
Superman!

06:36.161 --> 06:39.198
[patriotic music playing]

06:39.231 --> 06:41.834
-[people applauding]
-[camera shutters clicking]

06:41.867 --> 06:44.703
Can't I just smile and wave?

06:44.736 --> 06:48.474
We all must make sacrifices
for the greater good, comrade.

06:48.507 --> 06:50.876
But this display?

06:50.909 --> 06:53.913
You are a symbol
for all we aspire to be.

06:53.946 --> 06:55.948
The people need
to hear your voice.

07:00.619 --> 07:03.790
Your words are extremely kind,
Premier Stalin.

07:04.590 --> 07:05.691
Perhaps too kind.

07:08.994 --> 07:10.830
I am no hero.

07:10.863 --> 07:12.865
I'm merely a servant
of the State

07:12.898 --> 07:15.868
who seeks, as you do,

07:15.901 --> 07:17.537
to better the lives
of our citizens.

07:18.637 --> 07:20.239
Yes, I work to protect them,

07:20.272 --> 07:23.476
perhaps inspire them
in some small way.

07:23.509 --> 07:25.044
But make no mistake,

07:25.077 --> 07:27.213
I didn't build this dam.

07:27.246 --> 07:28.948
The Soviet people did,

07:28.981 --> 07:31.016
and may it stand forever
as an example

07:31.049 --> 07:33.619
of what we as a people
can achieve here

07:33.652 --> 07:35.087
and across the world,

07:35.120 --> 07:37.890
so long as we remain united

07:37.923 --> 07:38.891
by our ideals.

07:39.791 --> 07:43.529
[people cheering]

07:51.003 --> 07:53.239

08:17.696 --> 08:18.864
[officer] Colonel Masoff.

08:18.897 --> 08:20.799
-[console beeping]
-What is it?

08:20.832 --> 08:21.967
The Zenit satellite, sir,

08:22.000 --> 08:23.536
it's fallen out of orbit.

08:23.569 --> 08:25.204
What?
But that's...

08:26.104 --> 08:27.740
What's the trajectory?

08:27.773 --> 08:29.808
North America, sir.

08:29.841 --> 08:31.644
The eastern seaboard
of the United States.

08:35.714 --> 08:39.751
[people clamoring]

08:44.590 --> 08:46.258
[gasps]

08:46.291 --> 08:48.294
-[girl screaming]
-Look, up in the sky!

09:29.868 --> 09:32.204
I don't blame
those among you that fear me,

09:32.237 --> 09:34.240
for you've been taught
to fear all your lives.

09:36.274 --> 09:39.678
And if you learn
nothing else today, learn this.

09:39.711 --> 09:41.780
We in the Soviet Union
do not oppose

09:41.813 --> 09:44.316
the citizens
of the United States.

09:44.349 --> 09:46.218
We only oppose the government

09:46.251 --> 09:47.920
that oppresses you.

09:47.953 --> 09:49.822
Our sole desire is for peace

09:49.855 --> 09:51.991
and equality among all men.

09:52.024 --> 09:53.792
[woman] And what about women?

09:53.825 --> 09:54.893
Lois Lane,

09:54.926 --> 09:55.861
Daily Planet.

09:57.062 --> 09:59.665
Lois Lane Luthor.

09:59.698 --> 10:01.033
I know of you...

10:01.066 --> 10:04.770
and your capitalist husband.

10:04.803 --> 10:08.374
If you're
really serious about us
wanting to learn about you,

10:08.407 --> 10:09.642
how about an interview?

10:10.976 --> 10:13.245
The press is the enemy
of the people.

10:13.278 --> 10:14.847
Why would I let you
twist my words

10:14.880 --> 10:16.248
and use them against me?

10:17.449 --> 10:19.318
So, the great Soviet Superman

10:19.351 --> 10:22.421
is afraid of
the free expression of ideas.

10:22.454 --> 10:25.758
[people murmuring]

10:44.810 --> 10:47.079
You really shouldn't smoke,
Mrs. Luthor.

10:50.449 --> 10:52.284
This is the same brand
my doctor smokes.

10:54.386 --> 10:56.355
So, you're not afraid
of the American press.

10:58.356 --> 10:59.825
I'm not afraid of anything.

11:02.094 --> 11:03.696
Have you ever considered

11:03.729 --> 11:05.264
that the lack of fear
can lead to arrogance?

11:05.297 --> 11:07.366
Recklessness?

11:07.399 --> 11:09.935
Eisenhower's saying
your people sabotaged
their own satellite...

11:09.968 --> 11:11.437
We did no such thing.

11:11.470 --> 11:13.105
...so that you could come
flying in to save the day.

11:14.372 --> 11:15.874
You have to admit,

11:15.907 --> 11:18.010
it is the perfect
propaganda opportunity.

11:21.980 --> 11:23.749
Is it propaganda to envision

11:23.782 --> 11:25.417
a world where
the poor and afflicted

11:25.450 --> 11:27.252
can be lifted out of misery?

11:27.285 --> 11:29.254
Where the working classes
can rise together

11:29.287 --> 11:31.991
and reshape humanity
for generations?

11:33.024 --> 11:34.426
You're a super alien.

11:34.459 --> 11:37.763
What could you possibly
know about humanity?

11:37.796 --> 11:40.365
Until I was 12 years old,
Mrs. Luthor--

11:40.398 --> 11:42.435
"Lane." I'm not an appendage.

11:44.236 --> 11:47.272
Until I was 12 years old,
Ms. Lane,

11:47.305 --> 11:49.842
I was as human as you are.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.778
This planet is the only home
I've ever known.

11:52.811 --> 11:55.815
And I would sacrifice anything
to protect her.

11:57.249 --> 11:58.817
The United States already is

11:58.850 --> 12:00.486
the protector
of the free world.

12:00.519 --> 12:02.988
The bulwark
of liberty and equality.

12:03.021 --> 12:04.523
Your bulwark was built

12:04.556 --> 12:07.126
on the backs of slaves
and immigrants.

12:07.159 --> 12:09.528
And it hasn't changed much,
has it?

12:09.561 --> 12:12.831
While you and your
privileged kind
live in luxury,

12:12.864 --> 12:14.867
all across your country,
people are struggling,

12:15.567 --> 12:17.069
suffering,

12:17.102 --> 12:18.204
dying.

12:19.337 --> 12:21.006
I can't deny that there's a gap

12:21.039 --> 12:24.843
between the American dream
and the American reality.

12:24.876 --> 12:27.379
But there are
some massive gaps
in your utopian vision

12:27.412 --> 12:29.281
that need addressing as well.

12:29.314 --> 12:31.216
What is this?

12:31.249 --> 12:33.319
Proof of the repression
in the USSR.

12:34.319 --> 12:35.554
The Gulags,

12:35.587 --> 12:37.322
mass executions of people

12:37.355 --> 12:39.525
unfortunate enough
to be labelled dissidents

12:39.558 --> 12:41.427
by your beloved Premier Stalin.

12:43.261 --> 12:44.897
Lies.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.932
I would certainly know
if such things existed.

12:48.066 --> 12:49.034
Would you?

13:26.037 --> 13:26.906
[lighter opens]

13:57.002 --> 13:58.403
Welcome, Superman.

13:58.436 --> 14:01.106
[stammering]
We weren't
expecting you.

14:01.139 --> 14:02.374
I'm sure you weren't.

14:18.924 --> 14:21.527
Shielded by lead
to prevent me
from discovering it.

15:00.632 --> 15:05.137
[metal clanking]

15:30.362 --> 15:34.400
[prisoners coughing]

15:58.790 --> 16:00.559
[boy] You are the Superman.

16:02.460 --> 16:05.664
They say you can
hear a leaf fall
a thousand miles away.

16:07.732 --> 16:09.401
And you never heard our cries?

16:25.316 --> 16:26.518
[woman] It is you.

16:30.188 --> 16:31.190
At last.

16:34.125 --> 16:35.127
Svetlana?

16:40.165 --> 16:42.735
[Svetlana breathing weakly]

17:25.676 --> 17:27.112
[coughs]

17:27.145 --> 17:28.213
[Svetlana gasps]

17:42.427 --> 17:44.663
[quivering] I...
I could have died...

17:45.897 --> 17:48.600
Should have died, long ago.

17:49.868 --> 17:53.872
But I held on for you.

17:53.905 --> 17:57.542
I never stopped believing
that you would come one day

17:57.575 --> 17:59.144
to liberate us.

18:00.245 --> 18:01.346
That we'd see each other...

18:02.480 --> 18:04.850
one last time.

18:04.883 --> 18:07.653
But what did you do
to deserve such a punishment?

18:10.488 --> 18:11.657
I knew you...

18:12.724 --> 18:13.692
before.

18:15.894 --> 18:18.296
I'm so sorry, Lana.

18:18.329 --> 18:20.265
I didn't know.

18:20.298 --> 18:21.700
Don't blame yourself.

18:22.834 --> 18:23.802
You are...

18:24.736 --> 18:26.472
You have always been...

18:27.739 --> 18:28.740
my hope.

18:29.674 --> 18:30.809
My savior.

18:32.243 --> 18:33.645
But I am no--

18:33.678 --> 18:37.582
This is a world,
where the strong rule.

18:37.615 --> 18:40.519
And you are the strongest
of all of us.

18:41.619 --> 18:42.721
[coughs]

18:44.956 --> 18:46.158
[sighs]

18:49.194 --> 18:52.931
Remember when we were
small, Somishka?

18:52.964 --> 18:55.200
How I used to save you
from those bullies?

18:57.702 --> 19:00.172
Now you must save all of us.

19:01.472 --> 19:04.476
Use your power to...

19:32.704 --> 19:33.805
[Superman]
Millions of people dead.

19:37.275 --> 19:38.777
Explain that to me,
Premier Stalin.

19:40.845 --> 19:42.781
Help me to understand how...

19:42.814 --> 19:44.883
Why you could do this?

19:47.318 --> 19:49.321
[Stalin]
I tried to protect you,
my son.

19:50.255 --> 19:51.990
To keep you untainted

19:52.023 --> 19:54.359
by the grim realities
of governments.

19:55.426 --> 19:57.629
I asked you, why?

20:00.465 --> 20:02.935
Because, as much as
it breaks my heart...

20:05.703 --> 20:06.772
it is necessary.

20:08.306 --> 20:10.676
How could such atrocities
be necessary?

20:11.676 --> 20:13.345
What you call atrocities...

20:14.912 --> 20:18.016
I call terrible necessities.

20:18.049 --> 20:20.719
For our vision
of a better world to succeed,

20:20.752 --> 20:23.455
we must weed out
the insurgents.

20:23.488 --> 20:25.423
The weak.

20:25.456 --> 20:28.460
The ones whose minds
have been poisoned
against the State.

20:28.493 --> 20:30.662
They're human beings.

20:30.695 --> 20:32.631
You're like
a blind kitten, comrade.

20:33.464 --> 20:34.866
So good, so pure.

20:35.867 --> 20:37.836
But you just can't see.

20:37.869 --> 20:39.538
You must understand.

20:40.371 --> 20:41.873
You must believe

20:41.906 --> 20:43.808
that everything I've done

20:43.841 --> 20:46.344
has been for the ultimate good
of the people

20:46.377 --> 20:48.380
and the welfare
of the Soviet State.

20:49.947 --> 20:51.283
The State's welfare...

20:51.883 --> 20:52.951
Or your welfare?

20:53.851 --> 20:55.454
They're one and the same.

20:58.656 --> 20:59.924
We need to close the gap

20:59.957 --> 21:02.327
between our highest
communist ideals

21:02.360 --> 21:04.730
and the cruel reality
I saw today.

21:06.064 --> 21:07.833
Then I urge you to try.

21:09.100 --> 21:10.602
But you'll quickly find

21:10.635 --> 21:12.937
that the only way
to achieve that goal

21:12.970 --> 21:14.573
is to follow my example.

21:15.873 --> 21:18.310
The unpleasant truth, my son,

21:18.343 --> 21:21.046
is that certain people must die

21:21.079 --> 21:23.282
in order for the system
to work.

21:26.351 --> 21:27.686
Wise words.

21:31.889 --> 21:34.493
[Stalin screaming]

21:54.912 --> 21:55.981
What now?

22:03.454 --> 22:04.489
Now?

22:05.456 --> 22:07.392
Now I save the world.

22:15.800 --> 22:17.035
[Lois] You might consider
cutting down

22:17.068 --> 22:19.871
on those four-course
dinners, Lex.

22:19.904 --> 22:22.507
You're getting a little thick
around the middle.

22:22.540 --> 22:24.443
Vanity is more
your style, my dear.

22:25.410 --> 22:27.011
Unfortunately, darling,

22:27.044 --> 22:28.747
we live in a world
where people talk

22:28.780 --> 22:31.616
as much about my looks
as my work.

22:31.649 --> 22:35.053
While a man
can be fat or skinny,

22:35.987 --> 22:36.955
short or tall,

22:38.423 --> 22:40.458
hairy or bald...

22:40.491 --> 22:42.094
and it doesn't matter
one tiny bit.

22:44.061 --> 22:46.131
Did you read
Hedda Hopper's column today?

22:46.164 --> 22:47.799
She claims you're pregnant.

22:47.832 --> 22:49.501
[Lois chuckles]

22:49.534 --> 22:51.936
Like I'm ever gonna
end up some happy housewife

22:51.969 --> 22:54.038
with a brood of annoying brats.

22:54.071 --> 22:54.940
[phone ringing]

22:55.673 --> 22:56.641
That's mine.

22:59.043 --> 23:00.478
Lois Lane.

23:00.511 --> 23:02.147
[man speaking
indistinctly over phone]

23:02.180 --> 23:03.081
What?

23:03.114 --> 23:04.649
Slow down, Perry.

23:04.682 --> 23:06.084
[Perry speaking indistinctly
over phone]

23:06.117 --> 23:08.487
Right. Got it.

23:11.189 --> 23:12.124
Stalin is dead.

23:13.724 --> 23:17.195
Apparently all hell's
breaking loose in Moscow.

23:17.228 --> 23:19.831
As I knew it would
when I gave you that file.

23:21.065 --> 23:22.768
I hope this isn't a mistake.

23:24.602 --> 23:25.871
I don't make mistakes.

23:32.677 --> 23:33.779
[elevator engine whirring]

23:35.246 --> 23:37.081
Morning, Mr. Luthor.

23:37.114 --> 23:38.950
Special Agent Olsen.

23:38.983 --> 23:41.520
How is my favorite G-man
babysitter today?

23:42.153 --> 23:43.621
Excellent, Mr. L.

23:43.654 --> 23:44.990
And how's my most
exhausting assignment?

23:45.857 --> 23:47.192
[Lex] The usual.

23:47.225 --> 23:49.160
[Olsen] Burdened by
your own brilliance?

23:49.193 --> 23:51.696
Frustrated by the limitations
of everyone around you?

23:52.964 --> 23:54.199
You know me too well, James.

23:55.132 --> 23:56.601
I'll say it again.

23:56.634 --> 23:58.703
This is extraordinary,
even for you.

23:58.736 --> 24:00.538
[Lex] True,

24:00.571 --> 24:02.073
technology curves stipulated
that none of this equipment

24:02.106 --> 24:05.777
would even be invented
for another five decades.

24:05.810 --> 24:08.113
I guess the Man of Steel
makes your head work
faster, huh?

24:20.258 --> 24:21.759
[Lex] Careful there!

24:21.792 --> 24:23.161
The genetic information
the alien left

24:23.194 --> 24:25.797
on that satellite is essential.

24:25.830 --> 24:27.632
Especially if Ike
expects me to build him

24:27.665 --> 24:29.534
a Superman of his very own.

24:32.270 --> 24:33.771
[news anchor] We thought
that the bloody conflict

24:33.804 --> 24:35.540
was over four years ago,

24:35.573 --> 24:37.709
that a fragile peace
had finally come

24:37.742 --> 24:39.711
to the war-torn
Korean Peninsula.

24:41.245 --> 24:44.583
We didn't realize just
how fragile it was.

24:48.152 --> 24:50.288
It began 24 hours ago,

24:50.321 --> 24:51.956
when the Soviet Premier
announced

24:51.989 --> 24:53.858
that he would be
liberating the South

24:53.891 --> 24:55.293
from American oppression

24:55.326 --> 24:59.731
and reuniting the Korean people
under his rule.

24:59.764 --> 25:01.766
The last war went on
for three years.

25:03.100 --> 25:05.837
This one was over
in three hours.

25:08.706 --> 25:11.809
We deeply regret
the loss of life today.

25:11.842 --> 25:14.913
Even a single death
is a tragedy.

25:14.946 --> 25:16.781
But a few thousand

25:16.814 --> 25:18.716
weighed against
the nearly three million

25:18.749 --> 25:21.152
who perished in
the previous Korean conflict,

25:21.185 --> 25:24.956
we believe that's
a small price
to pay for peace.

25:26.290 --> 25:27.725
And there will be peace

25:27.758 --> 25:31.062
and prosperity
for all Korean citizens.

25:31.095 --> 25:33.598
I promise you that we are
not here to dominate you

25:33.631 --> 25:35.133
or trample your rights.

25:35.166 --> 25:37.936
We are here to lift you up
and set you free,

25:37.969 --> 25:40.338
to offer you a better life.

25:40.371 --> 25:42.140
And what we offer
the people of Korea...

25:43.341 --> 25:45.110
we offer to the entire world.

25:53.017 --> 25:54.819
[Olsen] I hear congratulations
are in order.

25:55.686 --> 25:57.255
Thank you, Olsen.

25:57.288 --> 25:59.290
The solar engine I conceived
in the shower this morning

25:59.323 --> 26:02.226
will certainly revolutionize
the automobile industry.

26:02.259 --> 26:04.129
-But how--
-[Olsen] I wasn't talking
about you, sir.

26:05.262 --> 26:07.231
Perry White's retirement?

26:07.264 --> 26:09.867
Your wife becoming
editor-in-chief
of the Daily Planet?

26:09.900 --> 26:13.771
If we'd seen each other
for more than a few hours
these past four months,

26:13.804 --> 26:15.940
maybe you wouldn't be
so befuddled.

26:15.973 --> 26:19.044
Sorry, my dear, I've been
understandably distracted
with the project.

26:21.045 --> 26:22.914
Oh, Christ, don't tell me.

26:22.947 --> 26:25.683
Yep, you forgot
our anniversary.

26:25.716 --> 26:26.585
Again.

26:34.725 --> 26:37.128
Impeccable taste,
as always.

26:40.031 --> 26:43.001
I'll dispatch Ms. Teschmacher
to get you... something.

26:43.034 --> 26:45.036
It'll be delivered later today.

26:45.069 --> 26:46.972
You're such a sentimentalist.

26:58.416 --> 27:01.386
You're a woman of great
patience, Ms. Lane.

27:01.419 --> 27:03.388
In other words,
why do I put up with him?

27:04.155 --> 27:05.356
Three reasons.

27:05.389 --> 27:07.392
One, he supports my career.

27:07.425 --> 27:09.761
Two, the sex is phenomenal.

27:09.794 --> 27:11.363
[clears throat] And three?

27:13.764 --> 27:17.368
That man is gonna
change the world.

27:17.401 --> 27:20.138
[Eisenhower] With the emergence
of the Soviet Superman,

27:20.171 --> 27:22.774
the Cold War reached
a freezing point.

27:22.807 --> 27:26.444
Our nation reacted to this
new threat as it had to.

27:26.477 --> 27:30.081
By doing everything
in our power to hold back
the communist tide

27:30.114 --> 27:33.351
through force of arms
and force of will.

27:33.384 --> 27:36.320
But as recent lessons in Korea
have taught us,

27:36.353 --> 27:39.424
conventional weapons
aren't enough when one man,

27:39.457 --> 27:41.192
one alien,

27:41.225 --> 27:44.395
has the power to bring
entire nations to their knees.

27:44.428 --> 27:49.467
And so, we turn to the only
person who could shift
the balance of power.

27:49.500 --> 27:51.169
[all applauding]

27:56.340 --> 27:58.476
[Lex] Thank you,
Mr. President,

27:58.509 --> 28:01.913
for both your service
to your great nation
and your confidence in me.

28:01.946 --> 28:06.117
A confidence that I believe,
has been rewarded today.

28:06.150 --> 28:09.353
Many of our citizens have lived
in fear of the Soviet Superman.

28:09.386 --> 28:10.888
But no longer.

28:10.921 --> 28:12.256
As of today,

28:12.289 --> 28:15.860
the United States
has its own living weapon.

28:15.893 --> 28:18.797
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you...

28:23.501 --> 28:25.103
Superior Man.

28:30.307 --> 28:34.078
Faster, stronger
and far deadlier
than our Russian friend.

28:34.111 --> 28:35.180
And once unleashed...

28:36.213 --> 28:38.750
[all exclaiming]

28:38.783 --> 28:43.154
...my creation will restore
American superiority and
bring the Red Menace

28:43.187 --> 28:44.222
to its knees.

28:57.868 --> 28:59.904
America first!

28:59.937 --> 29:01.506
[all cheering]

29:03.073 --> 29:04.108
Questions?

29:04.141 --> 29:06.244
[all clamoring]

29:08.245 --> 29:09.447
One at a time, please.

29:10.247 --> 29:11.215
Mr. True.

29:11.248 --> 29:13.551
I'm confused, Mr. Luthor.

29:13.584 --> 29:16.788
A project like this,
wouldn't it be better to keep
it secret from the Russians?

29:16.821 --> 29:19.924
Why reveal this new weapon
to the world in such
a public way?

29:19.957 --> 29:21.926
For one very good reason.

29:21.959 --> 29:24.763
I want our friend in Moscow
to know what's coming.

29:25.596 --> 29:27.432
I want him to be afraid.

29:29.967 --> 29:32.971
[classical music playing]

29:35.039 --> 29:38.309
To say that I am honored
to have you here, Ambassador,

29:38.342 --> 29:40.111
is a massive understatement.

29:41.011 --> 29:43.181
Call me Diana, please.

29:43.214 --> 29:47.018
On Themyscira, we have little
patience for formalities.

29:47.051 --> 29:48.386
And what shall I call you?

29:49.520 --> 29:50.488
Superman.

29:54.191 --> 29:56.360
I had a name once, Diana...

29:56.393 --> 30:00.498
before I stopped being a man,
and became a symbol.

30:00.531 --> 30:02.133
Then "Superman" it is.

30:03.167 --> 30:05.236
If only my mother had come.

30:05.269 --> 30:08.973
If she could meet you,
see what you've
accomplished here.

30:09.006 --> 30:11.175
She's still resistant?

30:11.208 --> 30:13.378
Queen Hippolyta
doesn't trust man's world.

30:14.445 --> 30:16.547
But you do.

30:16.580 --> 30:19.517
I believe that the only chance
for peace in this world
is reaching out,

30:19.550 --> 30:21.185
forging alliances.

30:21.218 --> 30:23.454
Finding common ground.

30:23.487 --> 30:27.191
The Amazons can't keep
their heads buried
in the sand forever.

30:27.224 --> 30:28.359
So you have hope.

30:29.426 --> 30:31.496
You give me hope, Superman.

30:32.529 --> 30:34.432
Stalin was a brute.

30:34.465 --> 30:39.003
But you, I think,
actually embody
the ideals you profess.

31:06.297 --> 31:11.068
You're the first person
I've met with abilities
like mine.

31:11.101 --> 31:14.239
Each of us alone has the power
to change the world.

31:16.240 --> 31:17.141
But together...

31:20.611 --> 31:23.414
[gasps] Forgive me, I...

31:23.447 --> 31:25.884
I come from an island
of all women.

31:27.084 --> 31:28.353
Work it out for yourself.

31:29.687 --> 31:31.522
Ah...

31:31.555 --> 31:33.191
Right. Of course.

31:34.224 --> 31:35.993
Hmm.

31:36.026 --> 31:37.462
Well, that's a relief.

31:38.629 --> 31:39.631
Is it?

31:45.402 --> 31:48.072
[Superman]
 I thought sex was what
you expected from me.

31:48.105 --> 31:51.342
It's certainly
pleasant enough,
but ultimately,

31:51.375 --> 31:54.578
it's a diversion from
the critical work at hand.

31:54.611 --> 31:56.581
Nothing wrong with
a good diversion...

31:57.548 --> 31:59.951
with the right partner.

31:59.984 --> 32:03.654
I don't need or want
a mate, Diana, but...

32:03.687 --> 32:05.690
I could certainly use a friend.

32:05.723 --> 32:08.426
I'd be proud to offer
my friendship.

32:08.459 --> 32:11.128
And my assistance.

32:11.161 --> 32:14.933
Perhaps together, we can change
the world for the better.

32:23.407 --> 32:28.279
And what do you make of this
duplicate Superman
the Americans have created?

32:28.312 --> 32:31.115
If you're asking me
if I'm worried, no.

32:31.148 --> 32:36.053
Our intelligence reports
indicate that this so-called
Superior Man is flawed.

32:36.086 --> 32:37.555
Incomplete and inoperable.

32:37.588 --> 32:40.992
A propaganda tool,
meant to frighten us.

32:41.025 --> 32:43.361
We do not frighten easily.

32:43.394 --> 32:46.998
So much fear,
so much mistrust.

32:47.031 --> 32:48.532
On both sides.

32:48.565 --> 32:52.203
Perhaps I could be a bridge
between your nations.

32:52.236 --> 32:55.640
I think you overestimate
the Americans'
desire for peace.

33:15.225 --> 33:17.528
[women screaming]

33:22.666 --> 33:25.302
[Superior Man yells] Superman!

33:25.335 --> 33:27.638
[people screaming]

33:30.774 --> 33:33.077
Come to me now, Russki.

33:33.110 --> 33:36.180
Before I bring this entire city
down on your head!

33:37.614 --> 33:40.584
Years ago, when Metropolis
was threatened,

33:40.617 --> 33:45.623
I put aside our countries'
differences and protected
the lives of the innocent.

33:45.656 --> 33:49.593
Yet you dare to come here,
as an invader.

33:49.626 --> 33:52.063
Not an invader, a liberator.

33:52.096 --> 33:54.565
I am truth. I am justice.

33:54.598 --> 33:56.701
I am the American way!

34:43.714 --> 34:45.815
This violence is unnecessary.

34:45.849 --> 34:49.152
You're not an enemy,
you are a victim of
the capitalist machine.

34:49.186 --> 34:51.688
-Surrender now, and I will--
-I am an American,

34:51.722 --> 34:55.193
and I will never surrender
to a commie dictator.

34:57.628 --> 34:59.463
Very well.

34:59.496 --> 35:00.765
You had your chance.

35:05.802 --> 35:07.638
[both grunting]

35:17.214 --> 35:19.884
The subcutaneous camera
you embedded in him
is working fine.

35:19.917 --> 35:21.685
Unfortunately, he's not.

35:21.718 --> 35:22.853
More power.

35:22.886 --> 35:24.555
He's nearing overload now, sir.

35:24.588 --> 35:27.258
Of course he is.
Now, give him more juice.

35:33.830 --> 35:34.765
[sighs in exhaustion]

35:38.402 --> 35:39.770
[shouting]

35:59.623 --> 36:01.792
[both grunting]

36:19.643 --> 36:20.845
[growls]

36:23.247 --> 36:24.282
More juice.

36:27.451 --> 36:30.688
Superior Man hates you.

36:30.721 --> 36:33.624
Superior Man kill you!

36:33.657 --> 36:34.692
[roars]

37:11.061 --> 37:13.231
-Lex, for God's sake.
-More!

37:20.604 --> 37:24.975
Me am truth. Me am justice.

37:25.008 --> 37:27.478
Me am... Americ...

37:28.912 --> 37:31.548
[stammers] Americ...

37:31.581 --> 37:32.516
Americ...

37:36.486 --> 37:38.623
Americ... Americ...

37:39.890 --> 37:41.659
Americ...

37:41.692 --> 37:43.594
-[Superior Man grunts]
-What's happening to you?

37:44.494 --> 37:46.030
Not know...

37:46.063 --> 37:48.933
Me feel... strange.

37:49.800 --> 37:50.801
Me...

37:52.436 --> 37:54.639
[screaming]

38:04.114 --> 38:05.416
Luthor.

38:15.559 --> 38:19.096
Unfortunate, but expected.

38:19.129 --> 38:22.066
There was only a 12% chance
Superior Man could have
killed Superman

38:22.099 --> 38:23.968
before he disintegrated
from the strain to his systems.

38:26.970 --> 38:29.506
-What?
-[Lois] You deliberately put
that poor creature

38:29.539 --> 38:30.841
into a state of overload,

38:30.874 --> 38:33.577
knowingly sent him
to his death. Why?

38:33.610 --> 38:35.412
Not a "him," darling, an "it."

38:35.445 --> 38:37.848
An inhuman construct created
from the alien's DNA.

38:37.881 --> 38:39.083
Why?

38:39.116 --> 38:40.651
To test Superman's limits.

38:40.684 --> 38:42.620
Unnerve him, psychologically
and emotionally.

38:43.687 --> 38:45.389
For a moment there...

38:45.422 --> 38:47.725
I actually saw fear
in his eyes.

38:47.758 --> 38:49.693
And that means--

38:49.726 --> 38:53.097
You created that creature
and then very consciously
murdered it.

38:53.130 --> 38:54.865
We're at war, Lois.

38:54.898 --> 38:57.968
Your compassion,
however admirable,
is misplaced.

38:58.001 --> 38:58.936
Don't!

39:03.874 --> 39:04.875
I'm sorry.

39:11.782 --> 39:14.585
This is Jack Ryder
reporting from
Checkpoint Charlie,

39:14.618 --> 39:18.689
where the final reinforced
section of the Berlin Wall
is being put in place.

39:18.722 --> 39:20.524
This veritable Iron Curtain,

39:20.557 --> 39:23.060
a massive undertaking
of the democratic allies,

39:23.093 --> 39:25.729
assures all freedom-loving
people of the West

39:25.762 --> 39:28.966
that they are finally safe
from the cancerous
spread of communi--

39:28.999 --> 39:30.167
-[thumping]
-[groans]

39:30.200 --> 39:32.870
Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen,

39:32.903 --> 39:35.573
but the sound of what can only
be described as a sonic boom
has shaken the ground here...

39:41.978 --> 39:43.947
Workers of the West,

39:43.980 --> 39:47.618
too long have you been deceived
by the lies of America.

39:47.651 --> 39:52.623
This pitiful wall
was created to prevent you
from knowing the truth...

39:52.656 --> 39:56.960
that you live your lives
enslaved to
the capitalist elite.

39:56.993 --> 39:59.096
In the name of peace,

39:59.129 --> 40:02.666
in the name of equality
for the United States
and Western Europe,

40:02.699 --> 40:04.635
I open this gate.

40:04.668 --> 40:06.704
I tear down this wall.

40:07.571 --> 40:08.806
[people clamoring]

40:17.881 --> 40:20.984
Ladies and gentlemen,
from what we've just
seen here today,

40:21.017 --> 40:24.054
it is only a matter of time,
very little time,

40:24.087 --> 40:26.490
until all of Western Europe
is absorbed,

40:26.523 --> 40:28.692
is taken
by the Soviet Superman.

40:35.866 --> 40:37.701
-[machine whirring]
-[people screaming]

40:55.986 --> 40:57.121
[grunts]

41:07.898 --> 41:09.567
[people screaming]

41:13.637 --> 41:14.872
[grunting]

41:59.649 --> 42:04.555
The attack on Stalingrad
by the alien artificial
intelligence called Brainiac

42:04.588 --> 42:07.624
has haunted the Soviet people
for years.

42:07.657 --> 42:10.627
The entire city remains
miniaturized,

42:10.660 --> 42:12.763
secreted away in the Kremlin

42:12.796 --> 42:17.267
where our Premier
works tirelessly to restore
Stalingrad's population.

42:17.300 --> 42:21.238
Over time, Superman was able
to reprogram Brainiac,

42:21.271 --> 42:24.808
and the living computer
now serves the State.

42:24.841 --> 42:30.314
Poverty, disease, and ignorance
have been virtually eliminated
in the Warsaw Pact states.

42:30.347 --> 42:33.984
And disobedience to the party
is now a thing of the past.

42:35.919 --> 42:39.356
The glorious future
envisioned by Karl Marx
is here.

42:39.389 --> 42:42.593
[Batman over PA]
 Really? When we're all
his pets.

42:42.626 --> 42:45.596
Animals in a carefully
constructed cage.

42:45.629 --> 42:47.831
He may feed
and shelter everyone,

42:47.864 --> 42:52.002
but the only freedom
we have is to be exactly
what he wants us to be.

42:52.035 --> 42:54.938
To do exactly
as he wants us to do.

42:54.971 --> 42:59.343
The only answer to this world
of perfect order is chaos.

42:59.376 --> 43:02.646
We have to blow
the entire system apart.

43:02.679 --> 43:06.016
Which is why this museum
is going to explode

43:06.049 --> 43:08.051
in ten minutes.

43:08.084 --> 43:10.887
-[people clamoring]
-Everyone, please proceed
to the exits

43:10.920 --> 43:12.089
in an orderly fashion.

43:12.122 --> 43:13.891
There's more than
enough time for--

43:24.367 --> 43:28.238
Did I say ten minutes?
I meant ten seconds.

43:55.765 --> 43:57.701
-Where did he go?
-[man over radio]
 He's on you, Petrovitch.

44:01.137 --> 44:02.373
[Petrovitch screams]

44:23.426 --> 44:25.362
[people clamoring]

44:26.963 --> 44:28.132
-There!
-Open fire!

45:11.775 --> 45:13.243
[all grunt]

45:13.276 --> 45:15.779
You serve that
terrorist bastard,

45:15.812 --> 45:16.880
plant his bombs...

45:18.281 --> 45:20.451
take lives
in the Batman's name?

45:22.118 --> 45:23.387
You don't deserve to live.

45:30.827 --> 45:33.196
But it's not your fault,
is it?

45:33.229 --> 45:35.932
He's fed you lies.
Brainwashed you.

45:35.965 --> 45:36.900
You're broken.

45:37.834 --> 45:39.470
I can fix you.

45:42.939 --> 45:44.908
[child crying]

45:44.941 --> 45:45.976
[woman gasps]

46:07.130 --> 46:10.000
[Wonder Woman]
What kind of human being
would do this?

46:10.033 --> 46:13.470
A soulless lunatic
with no respect for human life.

46:14.504 --> 46:15.506
Men.

46:16.239 --> 46:18.542
Not all men.

46:18.575 --> 46:22.012
No powers to speak of,
yet this Batman eludes
the police,

46:22.045 --> 46:23.480
the military.

46:23.513 --> 46:26.383
-You.
-I swear to you, Diana,

46:26.416 --> 46:28.085
his day will come.

46:33.289 --> 46:35.458
[Kennedy] The Army
retrieved it six weeks ago.

46:35.491 --> 46:37.327
As soon as I was informed,

46:37.360 --> 46:40.564
I brought Mr. Luthor in
to consult on the project.

46:40.597 --> 46:44.000
Of course, to Lex,
"consult" means "take over."

46:44.033 --> 46:47.137
I do my best to serve
my country, Mr. President.

46:47.170 --> 46:48.405
You know that.

46:48.438 --> 46:50.006
You serve the pursuit
of knowledge

46:50.039 --> 46:52.943
above all else, Lex,
but I respect that.

46:54.444 --> 46:55.946
[Hal] If I may ask, sir,

46:55.979 --> 46:57.047
what is it exactly
that they retrieved?

46:58.514 --> 47:00.184
See for yourself.

47:15.899 --> 47:17.301
Christ on a cracker.

47:18.134 --> 47:19.436
Apologies, sir.

47:19.469 --> 47:21.304
That's all right, Captain.

47:21.337 --> 47:23.574
I just about shit
a brick myself,
first time I saw it.

47:26.142 --> 47:29.112
The ship is made
of a fascinating alloy.

47:29.145 --> 47:31.581
We haven't been
able to identify it yet.

47:31.614 --> 47:33.984
Although we have been able
to determine the age

47:34.017 --> 47:35.886
and probable use
of the vehicle.

47:36.386 --> 47:38.054
But this,

47:38.087 --> 47:40.523
however spectacular,
pales beside what was found

47:40.556 --> 47:41.925
within the craft.

48:00.009 --> 48:02.946
[Kennedy] At first, we thought
it was a simple ornament.

48:02.979 --> 48:03.947
But now...

48:03.980 --> 48:05.282
We're beginning to suspect

48:05.315 --> 48:07.083
that it's the doorway
to a power source

48:07.116 --> 48:09.653
as old as the universe itself.

48:09.686 --> 48:11.321
Why haven't you
removed the ring?

48:11.354 --> 48:13.256
We've requested
permission, Mr. Luthor.

48:13.289 --> 48:16.159
But the brass is concerned
that it might be
some kind of...

48:19.062 --> 48:20.330
Problem solved.

48:20.363 --> 48:22.198
Understand,
it could take decades

48:22.231 --> 48:24.234
to retro-engineer this weapon.

48:24.267 --> 48:26.569
Why are you
telling me this, sir?

48:26.602 --> 48:28.038
Why did you bring me here?

48:28.071 --> 48:29.639
[Kennedy] Because,
Captain Jordan,

48:29.672 --> 48:31.942
we're setting up
an entirely new branch
of the military.

48:33.042 --> 48:34.678
And I want you to lead it.

48:44.487 --> 48:46.990
[Superman]
It's finally completed, Diana.

48:47.023 --> 48:49.192
And I wanted you
to be the first to see it.

48:50.293 --> 48:51.494
From here,

48:51.527 --> 48:53.630
I can be certain that the USSR

48:53.663 --> 48:56.533
ticks with the precision
of a Swiss watch.

48:56.566 --> 48:57.668
Brainiac.

49:04.540 --> 49:06.944
Summarize today's
statistics, please.

49:08.044 --> 49:09.446
Production is up 8%,

49:09.479 --> 49:12.549
life expectancy has increased
to 97 Earth years,

49:12.582 --> 49:15.552
with greater increases
predicted over the next decade.

49:15.585 --> 49:18.755
Suicides are down since I added
fluoxetine hydrochloride

49:18.788 --> 49:20.223
to the water supply.

49:20.256 --> 49:21.658
Birth rates are
on the rise, and--

49:21.691 --> 49:23.493
Thank you, Brainiac.

49:33.102 --> 49:34.171
What is it?

49:35.204 --> 49:36.773
My mother.

49:36.806 --> 49:40.043
She wants to shut down
the Themysciran embassy.

49:40.076 --> 49:43.046
What? After all I've achieved?

49:43.079 --> 49:44.748
But how have you achieved it?

49:49.352 --> 49:51.654
Better than the Gulags,
isn't it?

49:51.687 --> 49:53.790
Better than extermination.

49:53.823 --> 49:58.094
A day will come
when it won't be necessary
Diana, but till then...

49:58.127 --> 50:00.230
And what if
that day doesn't come?

50:00.263 --> 50:02.265
Is even one soul
suffering like this

50:02.298 --> 50:05.035
worth the price
of your perfect world?

50:05.068 --> 50:08.304
-On Paradise Island--
-Paradise Island is unique.

50:08.337 --> 50:11.041
Human nature is dark, brutal.

50:11.074 --> 50:12.642
It requires different methods.

50:13.443 --> 50:15.245
Human nature,

50:15.278 --> 50:18.048
or man's nature?

50:18.081 --> 50:20.417
Would you prefer
we were like America?

50:20.450 --> 50:22.052
Brainiac.

50:22.085 --> 50:24.054
[Brainiac]
A nation in decline, Princess.

50:24.087 --> 50:27.791
Economic depression.
Social unrest bordering
on civil war.

50:27.824 --> 50:30.760
Millions on the brink
of starvation.

50:30.793 --> 50:33.830
I had high hopes for Kennedy
when he was first elected.

50:33.863 --> 50:37.167
But he's turned out to be
just like the rest of them.

50:37.200 --> 50:38.802
Ranting about the Red Menace,

50:38.835 --> 50:40.804
refusing all offers of aid.

50:40.837 --> 50:42.806
[Brainiac] Perhaps it would be
more efficient, sir,

50:42.839 --> 50:44.574
to invade their shores

50:44.607 --> 50:47.744
and compel them to align
with the rest of the world.

50:47.777 --> 50:49.212
Out of the question.

50:49.245 --> 50:51.281
This global revolution
has been,

50:51.314 --> 50:54.084
with rare exceptions,
bloodless.

50:54.117 --> 50:55.718
America will eventually fall,

50:55.751 --> 50:57.621
and we'll be there
to pick up the pieces.

50:59.322 --> 51:00.590
Can't your mother see

51:00.623 --> 51:02.592
that we're building
a better world?

51:02.625 --> 51:03.860
Queen Hippolyta believes

51:03.893 --> 51:06.262
that freedom must spring
from within.

51:06.295 --> 51:08.264
That it can't be imposed
from without,

51:08.297 --> 51:10.266
no matter how high-minded
the motives.

51:10.299 --> 51:11.234
But...

51:12.768 --> 51:15.806
I've told her to wait,
to give you more time.

51:16.839 --> 51:18.809
I haven't given up on you yet.

51:22.411 --> 51:24.181
[classical music playing]

51:51.474 --> 51:53.676
The dinner
was wonderful, Premier.

51:53.709 --> 51:57.447
What? Yes, I'm glad
you enjoyed it, Mr. Ambassador.

51:57.480 --> 52:00.617
It's been too long
since we spent
an evening together.

52:00.650 --> 52:03.353
We have missed
your extraordinary hospitality

52:03.386 --> 52:05.455
and your warm friendship.

52:05.488 --> 52:07.924
As the representative
of the People's Republic,

52:07.957 --> 52:10.226
-I have nothing
but the greatest--
-We've known each other

52:10.259 --> 52:13.163
for some years, Ambassador Lee,
have we not?

52:13.863 --> 52:15.365
We have.

52:15.398 --> 52:18.168
Then why are you
still so cautious,

52:18.201 --> 52:19.503
so tense around me?

52:21.537 --> 52:23.573
"Tense"? [laughs]

52:23.606 --> 52:25.675
You are our savior.

52:25.708 --> 52:29.245
The man who is bringing
peace and prosperity
to a troubled world.

52:29.278 --> 52:32.649
-Whose flag flies over my--
-The truth, Ambassador.

52:36.552 --> 52:38.155
You terrify me.

52:41.290 --> 52:43.260
[bomb exploding]

52:55.738 --> 52:58.408
-[Wonder Woman] Superman!
-Diana.

52:59.842 --> 53:01.778
[Wonder Woman]
Ten seconds.

53:01.811 --> 53:04.614
Batman said you only
have ten seconds to find me

53:04.647 --> 53:05.715
before--

53:07.516 --> 53:10.286
Eight seconds to track
her voice here.

53:10.319 --> 53:12.856
[scoffs] Expected you in six.

53:15.491 --> 53:18.928
What have you done?

53:18.961 --> 53:22.799
My Lasso of Truth,
its energy is part of me,

53:22.832 --> 53:24.901
of my very soul.

53:24.934 --> 53:29.706
Batman used it
to bind me psychically
and physically.

53:29.739 --> 53:32.676
-And not even you
have the power to--
-Shut up.

53:34.377 --> 53:37.447
You see, now she is
as obedient to me

53:37.480 --> 53:40.850
as those poor mind-jacked
dissidents are to you.

53:40.883 --> 53:43.453
And she's under orders
to kill herself

53:43.486 --> 53:45.589
if you harm me in any way.

53:46.555 --> 53:48.625
What do you want?

53:48.658 --> 53:51.027
What I've wanted
since I was a child.

53:51.060 --> 53:52.829
To destroy you.

53:52.862 --> 53:57.433
To break and utterly humiliate
the great Superman.

53:57.466 --> 54:02.705
For all your powers,
you've always underestimated
the greatest weapon of all...

54:02.738 --> 54:04.774
the human mind.

54:06.442 --> 54:09.312
I can see your brain
from here, Batman,

54:09.345 --> 54:11.414
and it's nothing
to boast about.

54:11.447 --> 54:13.817
And can you see...

54:16.986 --> 54:20.423
-You think you're going to
stop me with that?
-No.

54:20.456 --> 54:21.491
With this.

54:31.467 --> 54:33.603
Sun lamps, wonderful.

54:33.636 --> 54:36.439
Let them burn
for a few thousand years,
and I might get--

54:40.676 --> 54:42.745
Impossible.

54:42.778 --> 54:46.649
These lamps were provided by
a mutual friend of ours
from America

54:46.682 --> 54:48.918
who specializes
in the impossible.

54:50.486 --> 54:51.888
[both grunting]

54:55.524 --> 54:58.695
They simulate the conditions
of a red sun.

54:58.728 --> 55:00.797
The conditions of your
home world.

55:04.867 --> 55:07.804
[Superman groaning]

55:17.780 --> 55:20.083
[both grunting]

55:30.626 --> 55:34.530
[groaning]

55:34.563 --> 55:36.966
[Batman] Pain is
a new sensation, yes?

55:39.068 --> 55:40.670
Get used to it.

55:45.474 --> 55:47.110
[Superman grunting]

55:55.651 --> 55:57.120
[weakly] I saved you all.

55:58.554 --> 55:59.856
Destroyed the Gulags.

56:01.624 --> 56:03.493
Gave you paradise.

56:03.526 --> 56:04.727
[Batman] Did you?

56:04.760 --> 56:06.496
[groaning]

56:06.529 --> 56:08.498
You and Comrade Stalin,
may have different methods,

56:08.531 --> 56:11.401
but you're variations
on the same tiresome theme.

56:11.434 --> 56:14.604
Narcissistic,
power-hungry egomaniacs

56:14.637 --> 56:17.707
bent on reshaping the world
in their own grotesque image.

56:24.947 --> 56:26.783
[groans]

56:26.816 --> 56:30.153
But in the end,
all men like you
inevitably fall.

56:33.122 --> 56:36.893
And there you will stay
for the remainder of your
wretched life...

56:36.926 --> 56:38.861
while my followers rise up

56:38.894 --> 56:42.632
and finally
take our country back.

56:48.771 --> 56:50.840
[groans]

56:58.914 --> 57:00.883
You may speak freely.

57:00.916 --> 57:02.819
You're a monster.

57:03.586 --> 57:04.587
And he's not?

57:05.588 --> 57:06.689
Men.

57:10.226 --> 57:12.695
All of you alike in the end.

57:15.698 --> 57:17.200
My mother...

57:18.601 --> 57:19.569
was right!

57:20.169 --> 57:21.571
[groans]

57:25.040 --> 57:26.609
[groaning]

57:36.185 --> 57:38.221
[straining]

57:47.563 --> 57:48.531
[grunts]

57:57.172 --> 57:59.042
[explosions in distance]

58:06.782 --> 58:09.852
Game's over, Batman.

58:09.885 --> 58:13.623
You don't understand
at all, do you?

58:13.656 --> 58:16.726
It may be a game to you,
but not to me.

58:16.759 --> 58:18.961
Never to me.

58:18.994 --> 58:22.532
Don't worry,
I'm not going to hurt you.

58:22.565 --> 58:24.267
I'm going to help you.

58:24.300 --> 58:26.736
Just a few hours
of brain surgery,

58:26.769 --> 58:30.273
and then, a nice job
in a Moscow laundry for you.

58:33.275 --> 58:34.677
[screams]

58:43.252 --> 58:46.188
Diane, let me help you.

58:46.221 --> 58:49.725
Like you were going
to help Batman?

58:49.758 --> 58:52.295
What? No, of course not.

58:52.328 --> 58:56.065
-I was just--
-I couldn't let you die,
Superman.

58:58.701 --> 59:03.072
But I can no longer
call myself...
your friend.

59:07.610 --> 59:10.846
This is what all men
bring upon themselves

59:10.879 --> 59:12.882
in the end.

59:12.915 --> 59:16.586
And this is what happens
to women...

59:16.619 --> 59:20.023
foolish enough
to trust them.

59:21.357 --> 59:24.627
As it was
with the Lasso of Truth,

59:25.995 --> 59:27.764
it is now with us.

59:28.831 --> 59:31.701
The bond has been broken.

59:47.216 --> 59:49.051
[man on TV]
 After years of unrest,

59:49.084 --> 59:52.121
insurrection,
and political assassinations,

59:52.154 --> 59:55.391
the end of the American epic
seemed assured.

59:55.424 --> 59:58.194
But the election of
Alexander J. Luthor

59:58.227 --> 01:00:01.931
proved to be
a miraculous turning point
for the United States.

01:00:01.964 --> 01:00:05.935
President Luthor,
ably assisted by
Vice President Olsen

01:00:05.968 --> 01:00:09.005
and press secretary
Lois Lane Luthor,

01:00:09.038 --> 01:00:13.142
slowly brought
the country back
from decades of chaos.

01:00:13.175 --> 01:00:17.279
Under his leadership,
a thriving democracy
has been restored,

01:00:17.312 --> 01:00:20.116
and America is on the rebound.

01:00:20.149 --> 01:00:25.221
But the US recovery,
has sent ripples of unrest
through the Soviet Empire,

01:00:25.254 --> 01:00:28.357
as people across the globe
begin to realize

01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:32.061
that you don't have to give
one man all the power

01:00:32.094 --> 01:00:35.364
in order for the world
to be a better place.

01:00:35.397 --> 01:00:37.233
[Superman] Turn it off.

01:00:40.335 --> 01:00:44.807
I'll give Luther one thing,
he's a master of propaganda.

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:48.811
A handful of
unruly demonstrations,
and they call it an "uprising."

01:00:48.844 --> 01:00:51.914
The American resurgence
is having an impact, sir,

01:00:51.947 --> 01:00:54.183
and not an advantageous one.

01:00:54.216 --> 01:00:56.218
I estimate that
within three years,

01:00:56.251 --> 01:00:58.454
discontent in
the Warsaw Pact nations
will reach critical--

01:00:58.487 --> 01:01:00.356
I don't care
about your estimations.

01:01:02.357 --> 01:01:04.093
Sorry, Brainiac.

01:01:04.126 --> 01:01:07.997
I am, as I often remind you,
an artificial lifeform

01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:09.432
void of emotion.

01:01:09.465 --> 01:01:11.868
There is never a need
to apologize.

01:01:14.770 --> 01:01:16.372
May I speak freely, sir?

01:01:16.405 --> 01:01:17.973
[Superman]
Of course.

01:01:18.006 --> 01:01:20.176
[Brainiac] Luthor has always
been a danger.

01:01:20.209 --> 01:01:23.245
Yet, for years,
you resisted direct action,

01:01:23.278 --> 01:01:27.316
remaining firm in the belief
that America will
consume itself,

01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:29.719
be the engine
of its own destruction.

01:01:29.752 --> 01:01:32.755
[Superman]
And it almost was.
It will be.

01:01:32.788 --> 01:01:35.458
It is my assessment
that an invasion
of the United States

01:01:35.491 --> 01:01:38.260
is our only recourse.

01:01:38.293 --> 01:01:41.163
Conquer the Americans,
capture Luthor.

01:01:41.196 --> 01:01:42.799
Re-condition him.

01:01:45.434 --> 01:01:46.869
No.

01:01:46.902 --> 01:01:48.304
If I'd wanted to,
I could've attacked

01:01:48.337 --> 01:01:50.106
and brought America
to its knees years ago.

01:01:50.139 --> 01:01:52.975
But I want to achieve my goals
by winning the argument,

01:01:53.008 --> 01:01:55.511
not beating my opponents
into submission.

01:01:55.544 --> 01:01:59.982
[Brainiac] At the moment, sir,
President Luthor is the one
who is winning.

01:02:00.015 --> 01:02:02.384
America is like a cancer cell,

01:02:02.417 --> 01:02:04.320
and it must be removed.

01:02:04.353 --> 01:02:08.224
If we attack now,
I estimate a total of only
6.5 million dead.

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:09.358
No!

01:02:12.161 --> 01:02:14.864
That's a choice
I will never make.

01:02:19.301 --> 01:02:22.038
[Brainiac] The choice
may have just been
made for you, sir.

01:02:23.272 --> 01:02:24.774
[radar beeping]

01:02:24.807 --> 01:02:26.375
[Superman] Missiles?

01:02:26.408 --> 01:02:28.778
Those are not missiles.

01:02:43.325 --> 01:02:45.427
Home base,
this is Colonel Jordan.

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:47.997
ETA red bunker, 20 minutes.

01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:50.399
[man on radio] Copy, Jordan.
We're only gonna get
one shot at this,

01:02:50.432 --> 01:02:51.834
so knock it out of the park.

01:02:52.401 --> 01:02:54.470
Roger, home base.

01:02:54.503 --> 01:02:57.039
Unidentified flying object
approaching, Colonel Jordan.

01:02:57.072 --> 01:03:01.010
Approximate speed is...
really freakin' fast.

01:03:01.043 --> 01:03:03.112
-Nervous, Captain?
-No, sir.

01:03:03.145 --> 01:03:06.048
Given the stakes,
fear is a luxury
we can't afford.

01:03:06.081 --> 01:03:07.917
Damn right.

01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:10.319
Look alive, Lanterns.
We've got incoming.

01:03:24.132 --> 01:03:25.968
[groaning]

01:03:29.404 --> 01:03:30.840
[Superman groans]

01:03:38.881 --> 01:03:40.483
[grunts]

01:03:42.217 --> 01:03:43.419
Focus, Lanterns.

01:03:43.452 --> 01:03:45.288
Think green thoughts!

01:04:05.274 --> 01:04:06.909
Is that the best you've got?

01:04:11.413 --> 01:04:13.349
Oh, God, that freak
is unstoppable.

01:04:13.382 --> 01:04:15.217
Keep it together, Gardner.

01:04:15.250 --> 01:04:16.619
Focus your will.

01:04:20.255 --> 01:04:21.557
[Guy screams]

01:04:47.616 --> 01:04:49.018
[grunts]

01:04:53.455 --> 01:04:55.925
-We got it, Colonel.
-Sure as hell--

01:04:55.958 --> 01:04:56.993
-[clangs]
-[Green Lanterns groaning]

01:05:00.128 --> 01:05:01.397
[high-pitched ringing]

01:05:11.373 --> 01:05:12.475
[Superman] Diana.

01:05:14.443 --> 01:05:17.379
I should've known
you'd come to back me up.

01:05:17.412 --> 01:05:19.048
Back you up?

01:05:19.081 --> 01:05:21.450
In the name of the friendship
we once shared,

01:05:21.483 --> 01:05:24.219
in the name of this planet
we both love,

01:05:24.252 --> 01:05:26.355
I have come to beg you...

01:05:26.388 --> 01:05:29.591
all of you, to stop this, now.

01:05:29.624 --> 01:05:31.427
Before the entire Earth

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:34.997
is consumed in
your insane war.

01:05:35.030 --> 01:05:38.734
-Stop? But Luthor--
-Peace is the way,
Superman.

01:05:38.767 --> 01:05:42.371
Let me intercede,
Let me speak to
President Luthor and--

01:05:42.404 --> 01:05:44.073
That monster could
manipulate you,

01:05:44.106 --> 01:05:46.275
convince you to turn against me
in a matter of minutes.

01:05:46.308 --> 01:05:48.744
Do you really think
so little of me?

01:05:48.777 --> 01:05:50.446
That's not what
I meant, Diana,

01:05:50.479 --> 01:05:52.481
but I can't stop now.
Don't you see?

01:05:52.514 --> 01:05:54.450
He's given me no choice.

01:05:54.483 --> 01:05:57.186
What I see is that
the man I once admired

01:05:57.219 --> 01:05:59.021
is long gone...

01:05:59.054 --> 01:06:00.489
if he was ever there.

01:06:01.523 --> 01:06:02.992
Then I am truly sorry.

01:06:11.333 --> 01:06:14.169
You're just another
pathetic man, aren't you?

01:06:14.202 --> 01:06:15.337
[grunts]

01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:17.473
-Diana--
-As of this moment,

01:06:17.506 --> 01:06:20.142
the Amazon nation washes
its hands of you.

01:06:22.044 --> 01:06:24.446
Themyscira will remain
hidden to men's eyes

01:06:24.479 --> 01:06:25.581
for all eternity.

01:06:29.518 --> 01:06:31.253
Farewell, Superman.

01:06:32.387 --> 01:06:34.390
We will never see
each other again.

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:46.168
Women, right?

01:06:53.475 --> 01:06:54.710
Light him up!

01:07:01.683 --> 01:07:03.019
[Green Lanterns grunt]

01:07:14.629 --> 01:07:16.132
You were right, Brainiac.

01:07:17.566 --> 01:07:20.102
It's time to take this
straight to Luthor.

01:07:31.813 --> 01:07:33.582
[buzzing]

01:08:19.426 --> 01:08:21.196
[Brainiac] Unexpected, sir.

01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:22.598
No soldiers.

01:08:22.631 --> 01:08:24.133
No Secret Service.

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:26.602
No defense at all.

01:08:29.571 --> 01:08:30.673
He's up to something.

01:08:37.444 --> 01:08:39.281
Whatever the game is, Luthor,

01:08:39.314 --> 01:08:42.251
whatever ultimate weapon
you're planning to unleash...

01:08:42.850 --> 01:08:44.386
it's too late.

01:08:54.395 --> 01:08:55.698
It's never too late.

01:09:14.448 --> 01:09:16.484
How did you get that?

01:09:16.518 --> 01:09:18.520
My husband's always ten steps
ahead of you.

01:09:21.622 --> 01:09:23.524
Look at them.

01:09:23.558 --> 01:09:26.295
Like specimens
in a laboratory.

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:27.729
Like flies in amber.

01:09:29.965 --> 01:09:31.367
Just the way you wanted it.

01:09:33.835 --> 01:09:35.437
What are you saying?

01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:38.307
I've spent decades
trying to restore them.

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:41.410
You're telling me that Brainiac
couldn't have done it
at any time?

01:09:41.443 --> 01:09:42.678
No.

01:09:42.711 --> 01:09:44.712
Brainiac was damaged
when I found him.

01:09:44.746 --> 01:09:47.549
-We tried and tried
to undo this--
-[Brainiac] Actually, sir,

01:09:47.582 --> 01:09:50.786
the restoration technology
was always available.

01:09:50.819 --> 01:09:52.888
But you did not want me
to utilize it.

01:09:54.489 --> 01:09:55.824
I never said that.

01:09:55.857 --> 01:09:58.594
[Brainiac] Words were
not necessary.

01:09:58.627 --> 01:10:01.964
Stalingrad is a representation
of all you have worked for.

01:10:02.797 --> 01:10:04.433
All you desire.

01:10:06.735 --> 01:10:08.737
A perfect symbol for a dictator

01:10:08.770 --> 01:10:12.575
who spent his entire life
trying to put the whole
world in a bottle.

01:10:19.347 --> 01:10:20.649
You have to believe me.

01:10:22.417 --> 01:10:23.952
All I wanted was,,.

01:10:23.985 --> 01:10:26.555
to put an end
to human suffering.

01:10:49.411 --> 01:10:51.313
Shut down
your weapon systems,
Brainiac.

01:10:52.314 --> 01:10:53.649
We're going home.

01:10:53.682 --> 01:10:55.617
[Brainiac]
Not recommended, sir.

01:10:55.650 --> 01:10:58.453
Retreat now will give
the Americans the advantage,

01:10:58.486 --> 01:11:01.023
-throw the USSR into chaos.
-I don't care.

01:11:02.524 --> 01:11:05.294
Stalin once called
me a blind kid.

01:11:05.327 --> 01:11:08.597
So pure in my beliefs,
so walled in by my ideals

01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:10.599
that I was unavailable
to see reality.

01:11:12.534 --> 01:11:13.936
Maybe he was right.

01:11:16.838 --> 01:11:21.610
But I finally do see that
this is humanity's world,

01:11:21.643 --> 01:11:24.746
and they have to be free
to make their own mistakes,

01:11:24.779 --> 01:11:26.648
chart their own course.

01:11:26.681 --> 01:11:28.317
[Brainiac]
And your perfect world,

01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:29.652
your utopia, sir?

01:11:31.853 --> 01:11:33.555
It's in their heads.

01:11:35.423 --> 01:11:38.327
[Brainiac] That is
an unacceptable response.

01:11:45.033 --> 01:11:47.436
I urge you to reconsider.

01:11:50.605 --> 01:11:51.607
Lois, get inside!

01:11:55.944 --> 01:11:58.046
You were never reprogrammed,
were you?

01:11:58.079 --> 01:12:00.349
You wanted me to bring you
to Moscow.

01:12:00.382 --> 01:12:03.018
[Brainiac]
A superb strategy, was it not?

01:12:03.051 --> 01:12:06.121
Expanding and consuming,
nation by nation.

01:12:06.154 --> 01:12:07.923
Why settle for a city
in a bottle

01:12:07.956 --> 01:12:10.693
when you can possess
an entire world?

01:12:11.793 --> 01:12:12.661
[Superman screams]

01:12:18.666 --> 01:12:19.735
[Lois screams]

01:12:31.813 --> 01:12:32.881
Lex?

01:12:40.155 --> 01:12:41.823
What is this thing?

01:12:41.856 --> 01:12:43.726
You know
I'm always prepared, dear.

01:12:48.797 --> 01:12:51.032
Now get down to the bunker
and let me handle this.

01:12:51.065 --> 01:12:53.502
But you could die out here.

01:12:53.535 --> 01:12:56.772
Really, Lois, all these years
together and you have
so little faith in me.

01:12:57.672 --> 01:12:59.074
I've never lost faith.

01:13:17.192 --> 01:13:18.961
We've got to get through
his force field.

01:13:23.465 --> 01:13:26.902
[Brainiac] My force fields have
been immeasurably improved
since Stalingrad.

01:13:26.935 --> 01:13:28.470
You barely pierced them then...

01:13:31.105 --> 01:13:33.542
and only because I allowed it.

01:13:51.926 --> 01:13:53.562
[both grunt]

01:14:25.994 --> 01:14:27.629
[console beeping]

01:14:36.638 --> 01:14:38.106
You used me!

01:14:38.139 --> 01:14:40.909
Manipulated me as if I was
some brainless puppet.

01:14:40.942 --> 01:14:42.644
[grunts]

01:14:42.677 --> 01:14:44.613
[Brainiac] My methods were not
unlike yours,

01:14:44.646 --> 01:14:46.281
only more efficient.

01:14:46.314 --> 01:14:47.483
Until now.

01:15:09.571 --> 01:15:11.940
[Brainiac] This is illogical.

01:15:11.973 --> 01:15:16.011
You are merely
a thing of flesh, while I am--

01:15:16.044 --> 01:15:18.013
A useless machine.

01:15:29.757 --> 01:15:32.761
Well done, Superman.

01:15:32.794 --> 01:15:36.731
Now, having realized what
a sociological disaster
you were causing,

01:15:36.764 --> 01:15:39.000
will you have the decency
to leave Earth?

01:15:39.033 --> 01:15:43.905
My only plan right now
is to bury this ship
in the Sea of Tranquility.

01:15:43.938 --> 01:15:47.642
Then I'll decide whether or not
I can safely stay on Earth.

01:15:47.675 --> 01:15:49.611
[machine whirs and beeps]

01:15:49.644 --> 01:15:50.579
[Lex] What the hell?

01:15:50.612 --> 01:15:53.081
[alarm beeping]

01:15:53.114 --> 01:15:56.651
He must have had a
self-destruct mechanism
encoded into the hard drive

01:15:56.684 --> 01:15:59.354
in case he was defeated.

01:15:59.387 --> 01:16:02.991
The six mini black holes that
were powering his engines
have been primed to go off,

01:16:03.024 --> 01:16:04.126
and I can't stop it.

01:16:05.026 --> 01:16:07.228
Then it's on me.

01:16:07.261 --> 01:16:09.898
When it explodes, it's gonna
wipe out everything in
a 15-million-mile radius.

01:16:09.931 --> 01:16:12.100
Even you aren't fast enough
to get it clear.

01:16:12.133 --> 01:16:13.302
Don't count on it.

01:16:14.202 --> 01:16:15.670
Get out of here, Lex.

01:16:15.703 --> 01:16:16.905
-But--
-Go.

01:16:16.938 --> 01:16:17.806
Now!

01:16:50.338 --> 01:16:51.673
What's he doing?

01:16:52.907 --> 01:16:54.109
Saving the world.

01:17:17.999 --> 01:17:21.970
[Svetlana] Remember
when we were small, Somishka?

01:17:22.003 --> 01:17:24.206
How I used to save you
from those bullies?

01:17:26.708 --> 01:17:29.011
Now you must save all of us.

01:17:31.813 --> 01:17:33.915
Use your power to...

01:17:55.403 --> 01:17:56.905
[Lex] Superman, gone.

01:17:57.505 --> 01:17:58.807
Brainiac, gone.

01:18:03.010 --> 01:18:05.714
One could be forgiven
for thinking this had all
been worked out

01:18:05.747 --> 01:18:07.949
to the tenth decimal point
25 years ago.

01:18:24.766 --> 01:18:26.134
Checkmate, Superman.

01:18:36.444 --> 01:18:41.049
It is with no small amount
of sorrow, and a vast
amount of pride

01:18:41.082 --> 01:18:44.085
that I stand before you today
to say farewell

01:18:44.118 --> 01:18:47.422
to this sacred office
and its scared trust.

01:18:47.455 --> 01:18:51.793
With the death of Superman,
the collapse of the
Soviet Empire is inevitable.

01:18:51.826 --> 01:18:53.895
We see it happening even now.

01:18:53.928 --> 01:18:57.232
But it's not the American way
to leave an enemy
gasping in the dust.

01:18:57.265 --> 01:18:58.967
We will reach out.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.804
We will give aid and comfort
to the Russian people.

01:19:02.837 --> 01:19:06.941
And with the determination
and compassion so unique
to the spirit of this nation,

01:19:06.974 --> 01:19:09.444
we will reinvigorate
the Soviet economy.

01:19:09.477 --> 01:19:12.413
A people that have lived
too long in the shadow
of oppression

01:19:12.446 --> 01:19:18.153
will awaken to the true power,
the shining glory of democracy.

01:19:18.186 --> 01:19:23.358
Be assured that, in time,
all the Soviet nations will
gladly and willingly join us

01:19:23.391 --> 01:19:26.495
in the formation of a truly
global United States.

01:19:28.396 --> 01:19:31.399
The world we'll build together
won't be perfect...

01:19:31.432 --> 01:19:34.402
but it will be one
we can all be proud of,

01:19:34.435 --> 01:19:38.173
because it will be a reflection
of the very best of humanity.

01:19:38.206 --> 01:19:39.374
[people cheering]

01:19:47.481 --> 01:19:50.185
My resignation has shocked
many of you.

01:19:50.218 --> 01:19:53.888
But a man has to know when
it's time to leave the stage.

01:19:53.921 --> 01:19:56.324
I leave it in the capable hands
of a truly great man

01:19:56.357 --> 01:20:00.128
who has worked beside me
for more years
than I dare to count.

01:20:00.161 --> 01:20:02.897
President James B. Olsen.

01:20:02.930 --> 01:20:04.232
[people cheering]

01:20:08.502 --> 01:20:11.173
I entrust that vision
not just to President Olsen,

01:20:12.006 --> 01:20:14.108
but to all of you.

01:20:14.141 --> 01:20:18.013
And with that,
I bid you all a truly
heartfelt farewell.

01:20:20.181 --> 01:20:22.184
[people applauding
and cheering]

01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:35.196
Time to leave the stage, huh?

01:20:35.229 --> 01:20:37.833
Well, time to leave
that stage.

01:20:38.933 --> 01:20:40.202
What are you gonna do now?

01:20:41.602 --> 01:20:43.338
Oh, I don't know.

01:20:43.371 --> 01:20:45.506
Write the great
American novel, maybe.

01:20:45.539 --> 01:20:48.476
Find a cure
for the common cold.

01:20:48.509 --> 01:20:50.612
Or maybe I'll just retire
to a desert island

01:20:50.645 --> 01:20:55.416
with the smartest,
strongest, most challenging,
most beautiful woman

01:20:55.449 --> 01:20:56.418
I've ever known.

01:21:01.622 --> 01:21:03.558
I kind of like
that last option.
