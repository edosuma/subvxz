September 1950,
in the thick of the Korean War,

00:54.388 --> 00:59.685
Allied Forces led by WWII hero
MacArthur succeed in Incheon Landing.

01:00.394 --> 01:03.189
Most of the Communist People's
Army soldiers

01:03.314 --> 01:07.610
were isolated by this operation
died or hid deep in the mountains.

01:08.903 --> 01:12.323
Allied Forces carried out
indiscriminate bombings

01:12.406 --> 01:15.409
to clear out
the People's Army everywhere.

01:16.118 --> 01:20.915
Some of these places were
civilian areas, too.

01:35.304 --> 01:40.893
Welcome to Dongmakgol

03:01.807 --> 03:04.393
Contact the general.

03:04.476 --> 03:05.477
Yes, sir.

03:54.818 --> 03:56.111
High Comrade.

03:57.196 --> 03:59.198
We can't go on like this.

04:14.213 --> 04:15.714
Give the order, comrade.

04:25.516 --> 04:27.601
High Comrade, let us live!
Let us live!

04:27.726 --> 04:29.603
Let us live, please!

04:29.728 --> 04:32.898
High Comrade,
please take me with you.

04:34.400 --> 04:37.820
Why aren't you following
orders from Command?

04:38.237 --> 04:40.114
Please take me with you.

04:40.614 --> 04:41.740
Comrades!

04:41.824 --> 04:43.409
You can't keep doing this.

04:43.492 --> 04:45.911
I can go, I can make it!

04:45.995 --> 04:49.206
Look, look!

04:49.707 --> 04:53.919
I can make it alone.
I can make it alone.

04:54.003 --> 04:55.296
High Comrade!

05:00.509 --> 05:03.095
One more word out of you and you're dead.

05:17.276 --> 05:18.902
We are taking all of them with us.

05:55.981 --> 05:57.399
Watch out!

06:02.488 --> 06:03.822
Get up!

06:11.121 --> 06:12.706
Comrades!

07:31.076 --> 07:32.286
What's your problem?

07:32.703 --> 07:34.788
What are you doing? Huh?

07:35.998 --> 07:37.207
Mister?

07:43.422 --> 07:44.590
Please...

07:46.091 --> 07:50.012
Don't kill me, please!

08:33.013 --> 08:37.183
How will we ever get to
Pyongyang like this?

08:37.308 --> 08:40.604
Unless you want to get caught
and killed, follow me.

08:41.688 --> 08:45.484
Are you sure we'll make it?

08:47.194 --> 08:48.612
Don't worry.

08:49.112 --> 08:51.490
I'll protect you, no matter...

09:04.419 --> 09:05.837
Damn it!

09:33.907 --> 09:38.537
We'll move after sunset,
so get some sleep.

09:55.304 --> 09:58.015
I'm Moon Sang-sang.

09:58.599 --> 10:01.018
I don't know your story, but, still...

10:01.101 --> 10:04.104
...you shouldn't just go and do that!

10:06.398 --> 10:09.610
What unit are you from?

10:10.402 --> 10:13.030
I'm real glad to meet up with you here.

10:14.031 --> 10:15.616
Ex-excuse me?

10:17.993 --> 10:19.995
It's dangerous to go off by yourself!

10:30.005 --> 10:31.214
What was that?

10:32.007 --> 10:34.593
- I think it was a person.
- Hey! What is it?

10:54.488 --> 10:56.198
There are snakes!

10:59.993 --> 11:02.120
Snakes here.

11:02.913 --> 11:05.415
This is a Snake Rock.

11:08.001 --> 11:11.421
Was that you just now, swished past?

11:11.630 --> 11:14.716
You saw? You saw me!

11:14.800 --> 11:16.301
I'm kinda fast.

11:16.426 --> 11:19.638
I'm real strange.
I don't run out of breath...

11:19.721 --> 11:23.392
And I swing my arms like this...
And I swing my arms like this...

11:23.475 --> 11:27.604
And my legs get faster,
and then... my arms get faster, and then...

11:27.688 --> 11:31.400
The ground rushes past, and...

11:31.483 --> 11:37.406
- I'm real fast
- What are you talking about?

11:38.115 --> 11:39.991
Your arms go like that,

11:41.201 --> 11:43.120
- and then your legs get...?
- High Comrade!

11:44.329 --> 11:46.123
She has a flower in her hair.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.628
Don't lie here.

11:51.712 --> 11:55.841
Snake bites hurt big.

11:56.007 --> 11:58.301
They hurt really big!

11:59.302 --> 12:00.512
Don't move!

12:03.181 --> 12:05.100
Still there?

12:05.183 --> 12:09.104
Come out of there. Come on!

12:09.813 --> 12:12.315
Idiots!

12:38.884 --> 12:42.304
Wow! What was that noise?

12:42.721 --> 12:46.016
How wonderful!

12:49.603 --> 12:50.896
Flowers!

12:56.401 --> 12:57.736
Pretty?

13:02.324 --> 13:04.201
Dumb bitch...

13:04.284 --> 13:06.912
High Comrade!

13:06.995 --> 13:08.497
- Let go! Let go of me!
- Please be calm.

13:08.580 --> 13:11.291
I'll kill you too.
Let go of me!

13:11.416 --> 13:13.001
- Let go of me!
- Calm down, sir!

13:13.084 --> 13:14.711
Where's she going?

13:14.920 --> 13:16.296
Give it here, comrade!

13:25.931 --> 13:28.934
Must be a village here.

13:29.434 --> 13:35.232
Then, maybe the Puppet Army, too?

13:35.607 --> 13:37.776
No way there's any army here.

13:40.195 --> 13:44.282
Shouted with a gun,
but she didn't even blink...

13:44.407 --> 13:46.701
Never seen this kinda thing before.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.288
No way there's any army here.

13:53.625 --> 13:54.793
Come over here.

14:00.006 --> 14:02.425
First, we need find the village.

14:02.717 --> 14:04.803
We'll get there and eat

14:05.303 --> 14:07.013
- and get some food...
- High Comrade!

14:08.223 --> 14:11.393
There might be snakes,
so let's go elsewhere and talk.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.824
Where are you going?

14:26.408 --> 14:28.410
Didn't you hear there
are snakes?

14:28.493 --> 14:30.912
But, we're the People's Army!

14:30.996 --> 14:33.206
People's Army can't get bit and die?

14:33.331 --> 14:36.501
We have no bullets.
You wanna pull a grenade?

14:36.626 --> 14:41.339
- Look, even High Comrade is going.
- I'm not going for fear of snakes.

14:43.091 --> 14:45.302
Then why are you, sir?

15:12.829 --> 15:15.916
What kind of greeting is that?

15:16.041 --> 15:18.376
Thrusting a stick in a man's face...

15:20.295 --> 15:24.591
Is there really a village
up this way?

15:24.716 --> 15:26.885
You think I'd take you
if there weren't?

15:27.510 --> 15:29.512
Geez, this is one tough climb!

15:30.889 --> 15:34.100
We could take
an easier road if you want.

15:36.019 --> 15:37.896
But we'd get there tomorrow.

15:47.822 --> 15:51.284
Do you always use that route?

15:51.701 --> 15:54.496
We don't come out often.

15:54.579 --> 15:56.206
But a while ago,

15:56.289 --> 15:59.709
this big guy drop down...

15:59.793 --> 16:03.421
He's real sick so I came out
to pick some medicinal herbs.

16:17.227 --> 16:19.521
A village way up here!

16:26.903 --> 16:29.614
This is our village, Dongmakgol.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.284
Dongmakgol?

16:33.910 --> 16:38.206
They say it's named that so
we'd live carefree, like children.

16:40.291 --> 16:42.127
Live carefree?

16:43.712 --> 16:45.922
I don't know
what's behind it.

16:46.006 --> 16:49.926
Just always been called like that,
since way back.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.388
How are you?

17:37.015 --> 17:38.391
What?

17:39.392 --> 17:41.019
How are you?

17:41.686 --> 17:44.689
How do you think I am? Uh?

17:45.106 --> 17:48.026
How do you think I am?
Look at me!

17:49.819 --> 17:51.696
I mean, look at me.

17:53.406 --> 17:56.910
I'm tied up with sticks...

17:57.035 --> 18:00.330
You know I feel like shit! shit!

18:00.413 --> 18:02.040
Not going well?

18:03.083 --> 18:06.086
It's strange...

18:06.211 --> 18:09.214
You can see,
like it says here, sir...

18:09.297 --> 18:12.717
- I can't read that.
- Yes, sir.

18:12.801 --> 18:16.721
Well, if I say,
'How are you?'

18:16.805 --> 18:22.393
He should say,
'Fine, and you?'

18:22.519 --> 18:24.604
That's the right
American answer...

18:24.729 --> 18:28.817
So then I can say, 'I'm fine'

18:28.900 --> 18:32.737
Only then is this a completed thing,

18:32.821 --> 18:34.239
but he's a bit...

18:34.322 --> 18:37.909
Why isn't he doing as he should?

18:39.494 --> 18:41.579
Is he picking a fight?

18:41.996 --> 18:44.999
Let's try a bit more.

18:45.083 --> 18:46.709
Do you... Do you speak English?

18:46.793 --> 18:48.211
Village Chief!

18:51.214 --> 18:52.799
Dal-soo's bringing some folks!

18:52.924 --> 18:55.426
From the mountain below!

18:55.510 --> 18:58.721
- Where they from?
- Come see!

18:58.805 --> 19:01.015
They've got gourds
on their heads,

19:01.099 --> 19:04.602
and real long sticks
in their hands!

19:05.603 --> 19:07.230
Village Chief, come quick!

19:19.617 --> 19:21.286
Thank you.

19:21.411 --> 19:22.704
No, no. Wait, wait!

19:22.787 --> 19:27.125
Wait a second, come back here.
Hey come back here, man!

19:27.208 --> 19:28.209
Wait, don't go anywhere.
Come back!

19:28.293 --> 19:29.294
O... ok, ok, ok.

19:29.419 --> 19:32.422
Wait, come back! Come back!

19:45.894 --> 19:47.979
They got lost, sir.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.315
They're gonna sleep over.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.692
We'll just stay a night, sir.

19:52.817 --> 19:54.986
We're good people.

19:56.821 --> 19:58.489
Welcome!

19:59.490 --> 20:02.118
You've come far.

20:02.202 --> 20:04.495
This is our Village Chief.

20:07.999 --> 20:10.335
Have you had something to eat?

20:16.090 --> 20:18.676
How're you feeling?

20:18.801 --> 20:22.180
With these herbs,
you'll be up in no time.

20:27.018 --> 20:28.686
He's UN, sir.

20:40.323 --> 20:42.700
I knew it!

20:42.825 --> 20:44.702
I knew it! I knew you guys would
come to get me.

20:44.827 --> 20:48.623
Thank you so much you guys.
Thank god you guys are here.

20:48.706 --> 20:49.582
Thank god.

20:49.707 --> 20:52.585
My name is Captain Neal Smith
Captain Neal Smith of US Navy.

20:52.710 --> 20:55.296
Thank god you guys have come.

20:55.380 --> 20:58.091
How come there's only two of you?

21:07.392 --> 21:09.227
Where's the rest of you guys?

21:10.520 --> 21:12.313
Do you guys understand me?

21:13.731 --> 21:15.233
Hey, where you going?

21:17.527 --> 21:18.903
Wait, wait! Where you going?
Come back! Get back here!

21:19.028 --> 21:21.114
How did he...?

21:21.239 --> 21:22.740
Dropped from the sky,
three or four days ago.

21:22.782 --> 21:26.703
He almost died...

21:28.288 --> 21:30.290
How do I look?

21:42.302 --> 21:44.220
It's sleeping.
Don't make noise.

21:45.305 --> 21:48.599
Be quiet!

21:48.725 --> 21:52.312
My fault, asking a crazy girl.

21:52.437 --> 21:56.691
Dong-goo, am I
one of those crazy girls?

22:03.489 --> 22:07.493
Is there more than
one crazy girl in our village?

22:07.618 --> 22:11.414
You put flowers
in your hair, don't you?

22:12.623 --> 22:14.709
- Do lots know beside you?
- Sure.

22:16.919 --> 22:20.798
Just as long as
Teacher Kim doesn't know.

22:23.801 --> 22:26.137
He says so, that you're crazy.

22:26.220 --> 22:30.099
Walk faster!

22:45.490 --> 22:46.824
Snakes not bite
while I was away?

22:53.498 --> 22:57.210
Guess not. You look fine.

22:58.711 --> 23:02.882
It's Teacher Kim!

23:08.596 --> 23:10.515
Well, who's this?

23:11.307 --> 23:14.310
It's too noisy.
Shut up, kids!

23:32.120 --> 23:35.915
Be quiet!

23:36.874 --> 23:38.209
Seems this song never ends.

23:40.002 --> 23:42.505
Teacher Kim, why are your hands up?

23:43.214 --> 23:45.716
Something good must be about to
happen in our village.

23:53.391 --> 23:56.602
So many folks from down the mountain.

23:56.727 --> 23:59.105
How do you know it'll be good?

24:02.024 --> 24:04.318
A war?

24:07.113 --> 24:08.614
- You say a war's started?
- Yes!

24:08.739 --> 24:12.493
Where'd they invade from?
Are they Japs or Chinks?

24:12.577 --> 24:17.290
Well, it isn't another country
that invaded...

24:17.415 --> 24:20.918
Wait a minute, is it another country?

24:22.003 --> 24:24.213
Well the thing is,
our National Army is fighting

24:24.297 --> 24:29.427
the Puppet Army from the North!

24:29.510 --> 24:32.305
Then, whose side is the big-nosed guy on?

24:36.726 --> 24:41.314
Wife, he must be on this side.
They knew him right off.

24:42.773 --> 24:47.778
That's right. Right.

24:47.904 --> 24:48.988
Then it's 2 to 1. That's not fair!

24:49.113 --> 24:53.618
Well the thing is, you shouldn't
look at it that way, ma'am...

24:53.701 --> 24:57.914
It's the kids!

24:57.997 --> 24:59.499
They're all up, coming here.
They should be home.

25:00.124 --> 25:02.710
My goodness,
Teacher Kim, you're right on time.

25:02.793 --> 25:05.922
Say hello.
We have guests from outside.

25:06.005 --> 25:09.634
We have guests
over here, too, sir.

25:09.717 --> 25:12.720
Sons of bitches, I'll kill you!

25:26.484 --> 25:29.612
Don't move or you're dead!

25:31.697 --> 25:33.991
Put down the gun, jerk!
Or I'll kill you all!

25:34.116 --> 25:36.327
- Put down the gun.
- I'll kill you!

25:41.123 --> 25:43.626
- Son of a bitch!
- Don't move!

25:43.709 --> 25:45.836
Don't move!

25:48.339 --> 25:50.174
Get inside! Take the kids and get inside!

25:50.299 --> 25:51.676
Take them inside!

25:54.679 --> 25:56.097
Hey, move!

26:00.184 --> 26:02.395
It's alright, folks, don't move!

26:03.896 --> 26:06.190
- I said don't move!
- Don't move!

26:06.315 --> 26:07.608
Don't move!

26:08.526 --> 26:11.404
You son of a bitch, get off!

26:24.000 --> 26:26.377
No army here, you said.

26:26.502 --> 26:29.297
What's up with
all the decisions you make?

26:30.298 --> 26:34.385
They're within ten paces.
Three of us, two of them.

26:34.510 --> 26:37.013
- Let's take them!
- Just stay put.

26:40.516 --> 26:44.020
Shit! I told you we shouldn't
come way up here!

26:44.103 --> 26:45.313
Hey!

26:48.733 --> 26:51.110
He's calling you.

26:52.820 --> 26:55.823
Since you put your finger in the trigger,
then you should pull it.

26:56.907 --> 26:58.492
What's there to think about?

26:58.993 --> 27:03.414
Have you forgotten
we've no bullets left?

27:03.497 --> 27:06.000
Don't talk too tough.

27:07.585 --> 27:10.004
Let's take this elsewhere!

27:10.796 --> 27:14.300
Are you crazy?
There's... there's three of them!

27:14.425 --> 27:17.720
Let's leave these innocent villagers
out of it and let's go elsewhere!

27:18.012 --> 27:22.224
- Don't mind us. It's okay.
- Suk-yong.

27:46.707 --> 27:48.626
Listen up closely!

27:49.794 --> 27:53.631
Puppet Army and villagers alike,
with one false move...

27:55.299 --> 27:57.301
...and you're all dead.

27:58.135 --> 28:00.721
I'm serious now.

28:09.480 --> 28:12.483
You got them all mad!

28:15.111 --> 28:19.115
- Is that a rock?
- It's like a lump of metal

28:19.198 --> 28:21.701
What's it for?

28:23.619 --> 28:27.915
I'll tell you later,
just do as they say, folks.

28:28.624 --> 28:31.127
I asked over here,
not there.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.211
God damn it!

28:32.336 --> 28:35.005
You turning your back on
me too, Teacher Kim?

28:36.507 --> 28:39.593
- Looks like a potato...
- Damn sons of bitches...

28:41.387 --> 28:43.681
Think I'm kidding?

28:43.806 --> 28:45.808
Maybe they painted one of these?

28:45.891 --> 28:49.395
If that's a potato, my wife eats
four of those a day?

28:49.520 --> 28:51.689
Everyone put your hands up!

28:51.814 --> 28:53.023
Yes, sir!

28:54.316 --> 28:57.194
Hands up, everyone,
before something happens!

28:57.319 --> 29:01.115
- Just one hand?
- Which hand?

29:01.198 --> 29:05.035
- What do we do with them up?
- Put them both up, folks.

29:05.828 --> 29:09.331
- What will happen?
- Everybody hands up

29:13.502 --> 29:15.087
Village Chief!

29:23.095 --> 29:24.597
Get up there!

29:26.015 --> 29:28.517
Damn it, get up there quick!

29:28.601 --> 29:31.812
- Come. Come on up here!
- Hurry, hurry.

29:31.896 --> 29:33.898
These folks is all riled up!

29:34.023 --> 29:38.611
Hurry up, hurry! Hurry, up here!

29:38.736 --> 29:43.282
- Yong-bong, what kept you so late?
- Checking the bee hives, sir.

29:43.407 --> 29:45.201
But, we've got bigger troubles!

29:45.284 --> 29:47.286
You should talk with your hands up.

29:48.788 --> 29:52.082
Yeah, you should put them up!

29:52.208 --> 29:55.586
You know the potato field
next to the hives?

29:55.711 --> 29:57.588
- The one we just planted?
- Yeah, there

29:57.713 --> 30:01.008
Wild boars rooted up a path
right through it!

30:04.428 --> 30:07.932
It doesn't look like it was just
one or two boars.

30:08.015 --> 30:13.604
The year before last,
they went into the cornfield and,

30:13.729 --> 30:15.231
- we starved for a whole month in the winter!
- That's right!

30:15.314 --> 30:20.277
Now, now, don't get worked up.
Let's talk it over calmly.

30:20.402 --> 30:21.612
Look here.

30:24.782 --> 30:26.492
Do you not see this?

30:27.201 --> 30:29.495
Worried about stupid boars?

30:29.620 --> 30:32.706
If I open this up, this yard will be
strewn with corpses!

30:36.794 --> 30:38.212
But, hey...

30:40.297 --> 30:42.299
Are you friends with those guys?

30:47.429 --> 30:49.682
- She's making me crazy...
- Have you eaten?

31:00.901 --> 31:03.821
Comrade, this is a weird village...

31:03.904 --> 31:05.614
Shut up, damn it!

31:12.997 --> 31:14.498
Now what's that?

31:16.333 --> 31:18.002
It's a Yankee, sir.

31:28.095 --> 31:29.805
Kicking up a ruckus...

31:31.682 --> 31:36.020
Yelling so much I can't sleep!

31:36.103 --> 31:38.898
Why don't you just yell in my ear...

31:39.023 --> 31:45.696
Get up, Grandma, quit sleeping?
Rotten offspring!

31:45.821 --> 31:47.615
Look, old lady, don't move!

31:47.698 --> 31:51.118
Where should I poo, then.

31:51.201 --> 31:52.703
My mother.

31:56.790 --> 31:59.001
- What do we do about the boars?
- Catch'em

31:59.084 --> 32:02.379
- How?
- What're you worried about?

32:02.504 --> 32:03.797
Listen...

32:03.881 --> 32:08.218
A boar shows up, you grab his neck
with your left hand...

32:08.302 --> 32:11.597
Hit him in the eye three times
with your right...

32:11.722 --> 32:13.891
Then his eye's will turn all black...

32:14.016 --> 32:15.392
He goes home like that

32:15.517 --> 32:17.811
and tells his friends...

32:17.895 --> 32:21.106
'Don't go to Dongmakgol!
It's an awful place.'

32:21.231 --> 32:24.234
Then they'll never come back!

32:24.318 --> 32:27.029
If it were you, got hit thrice in the eye,

32:27.112 --> 32:28.322
what would you do?

32:28.405 --> 32:31.200
Take all the boys back with me!

32:31.700 --> 32:34.912
Then...then we shouldn't hit them!

32:34.995 --> 32:37.915
If they all come back,
we can't get all those eyes.

32:41.001 --> 32:44.004
Damn it...
All of you shut up!

32:50.511 --> 32:51.804
Everyone sit down.

32:53.806 --> 32:56.225
You hear me? All of you, sit!

32:57.101 --> 32:58.310
Let's sit down.

33:27.506 --> 33:32.803
- Son of a bitch.
- Son uva-bitch!

33:34.138 --> 33:36.306
- Mother fucker
- Mother fucker...!

33:36.390 --> 33:39.893
- Son of a bitch.
- Son uva-bitch!

33:40.894 --> 33:42.604
What is it?

33:42.688 --> 33:44.314
The outhouse, sir.

33:44.815 --> 33:46.817
Don't move!

33:48.318 --> 33:50.988
Don't pee your pants.
Come back quick.

33:56.493 --> 33:59.830
Stay in your seat, sir.

33:59.913 --> 34:04.334
Gonna check the bee hives,
you stay right here, okay?

34:04.918 --> 34:06.920
- See you.
- Yeah.

35:42.015 --> 35:43.725
A ring!

35:48.313 --> 35:49.398
You crazy fool!

35:49.481 --> 35:51.608
- Secure it safely!
- Comrade!

35:51.692 --> 35:54.903
Idiot, can't take care of a grenade!

35:54.987 --> 35:56.405
Hey, hold still, you!

36:05.414 --> 36:09.126
Unless you study hard,
you can never speak English.

36:09.209 --> 36:11.920
Wasn't it inquisitive when
Teacher talked with the American?

36:12.004 --> 36:13.422
Yes!

36:13.505 --> 36:16.925
Want to hear what I said to him?

36:17.009 --> 36:18.927
- Yes!
- Yes!

36:19.011 --> 36:27.686
For instance, if I say, 'How are you?',
they'd say, 'Fine, and you?'

36:27.811 --> 36:31.899
And then I say, 'I'm fine.'

36:31.982 --> 36:36.904
And that would be the correct
American answer.

36:46.413 --> 36:48.332
Take cover!

36:59.676 --> 37:03.388
Teacher Kim, what's going on?

37:49.101 --> 37:52.729
Think this is a dud, too?

40:26.383 --> 40:27.592
Moon Sang-sang!

40:35.308 --> 40:40.605
Gosh, how... how can you sleep so?
Don't your backs ache?

40:55.203 --> 40:57.205
Not again! Not again... shit...

41:09.718 --> 41:14.431
Now, that's enough.
Come eat something.

41:14.514 --> 41:18.435
Don't worry, this man promised

41:18.518 --> 41:21.438
- ...so rest now.
- He promise?

41:22.230 --> 41:26.276
Sir, you don't know
these bastards yet!

41:32.991 --> 41:36.119
If you really want blood...

41:37.996 --> 41:41.208
get yourself a sharper tool.

41:48.715 --> 41:51.927
You all sure got vigor.

41:52.010 --> 41:53.720
I'll bring out some food.

41:53.803 --> 41:56.973
So go wash your faces.

41:57.098 --> 42:00.101
This is horrible.
The storage room is ruined.

42:00.185 --> 42:03.688
At least the potatoes got well baked.

42:03.813 --> 42:07.400
- Are we starving from today?
- Something will happen.

42:07.484 --> 42:09.194
Don't mind, something will...

42:21.706 --> 42:25.710
Sorry there's not much to eat.

42:25.835 --> 42:29.339
They blew up a whole year's
village provisions and you give them our food!

42:29.381 --> 42:31.299
What's taking you?

42:31.383 --> 42:33.885
Just curb your hunger a bit.

42:34.010 --> 42:36.805
Go on, now.
Eat.

42:36.888 --> 42:41.601
What do we live on when it gets cold?
The storage's empty.

42:41.685 --> 42:43.812
Is there really
nothing at all left?

42:50.402 --> 42:53.905
- Comrades.
- What?

43:04.499 --> 43:09.212
Shouldn't we have gone
with them to the field?

43:12.591 --> 43:15.594
What were you thinking,
tossing it there?

43:35.238 --> 43:36.990
It's strange...

43:37.073 --> 43:39.492
They're just working.

43:40.702 --> 43:44.205
High Comrade, how about we just
dig potatoes for a while...

43:44.289 --> 43:48.293
And join up with the main unit
when they come back south?

43:50.795 --> 43:53.715
The bastards might be
up to something.

43:53.798 --> 43:57.302
We can't just dig
potatoes in peace.

43:57.427 --> 43:58.928
High Comrade...

43:59.012 --> 44:01.097
Let's attack first!

44:03.016 --> 44:05.018
Just do your work.

44:09.230 --> 44:12.776
They all look like
good folks to me.

44:12.901 --> 44:18.406
You don't know anything
about reading people, do you?

44:18.490 --> 44:23.912
Yeah, don't mind about what I say.

45:12.919 --> 45:16.589
We'll fill the storage house.
You can leave the mountain.

45:18.091 --> 45:20.593
No good in staying together,
is there?

45:22.679 --> 45:28.518
Cut the funny talk. You leave!

45:28.601 --> 45:30.687
Why don't you wanna leave?

45:31.813 --> 45:35.817
Take that Yankee down
and you'd get a medal.

45:35.900 --> 45:39.320
Careful on your way, comrade.

45:40.405 --> 45:43.700
Down the mountain, People's Army
must be covering the area.

45:45.827 --> 45:52.000
You three are probably the only commie reds
on this entire mountain.

45:56.087 --> 45:58.381
Allied Forces have landed at Incheon.

45:58.506 --> 46:04.387
They've probably pushed up
to Pyongyang by now.

46:04.512 --> 46:08.892
South of that, nothing but
commie corpses scattered below...

46:09.017 --> 46:13.104
- All red!
- Son of a bitch! Quit your crap!

46:18.526 --> 46:21.529
You're the ones should be careful.

46:24.991 --> 46:31.080
If they've taken Pyongyang...
we're in big trouble.

46:32.499 --> 46:37.504
Sergeant, you believe that shit?

46:37.587 --> 46:41.800
Then what are those jerks doing
in these rough mountains?

46:41.925 --> 46:46.095
It's nonsense.
Don't be taken in by it.

46:50.308 --> 46:54.437
They might've run off from their unit.

47:01.110 --> 47:03.196
Aren't you gonna sleep?

47:03.905 --> 47:06.407
Let's get some sleep.

47:06.491 --> 47:09.786
You wanna get killed in your sleep?

47:09.911 --> 47:14.916
If they wanted to, they woulda done it
when we were sleeping before.

47:16.292 --> 47:17.710
Wait a minute!

47:18.711 --> 47:21.422
So why didn't they?

47:25.927 --> 47:28.805
Now the area that
the C802 transport plane

47:28.930 --> 47:31.182
went missing is
less than 10 kilometers

47:31.307 --> 47:33.977
from where the C520
transport plane went missing.

47:34.394 --> 47:36.479
Now the reconnaissance plane that
we sent to the area

47:36.604 --> 47:38.314
has disappeared as well.

47:38.398 --> 47:42.485
We can't be sure but we assume
that the remnants of the KPA

47:42.610 --> 47:46.406
with the small anti-aircraft base
is stationed there.

47:46.823 --> 47:50.910
Sir, this is
nothing but an assumption.

47:51.411 --> 47:54.205
We need to investigate
the situation further.

47:58.501 --> 48:00.837
The problem is geographical.

48:01.337 --> 48:04.507
This is a position
we cannot move or abandon.

48:04.591 --> 48:06.676
This is a supply route that
we must secure

48:06.801 --> 48:10.805
for amphibious approach
from Ganglion to Wonsan and Changin

48:33.703 --> 48:36.998
Gee-whiz... We shouldn't have said
we'd do the work for them.

48:37.081 --> 48:38.791
It'll never be done!

49:04.025 --> 49:05.902
Look here.

49:06.027 --> 49:10.490
- How come your face turned all red...
- No way!

49:11.574 --> 49:14.994
I'm just mad we have to be with those dogs!

49:15.787 --> 49:17.580
Hey, jerk...

49:17.705 --> 49:21.292
You're bad luck for us, too!

49:21.417 --> 49:24.212
- You little jerk...
- Forget about him.

49:24.295 --> 49:28.508
It'd just be embarrassing
to take on a little brat like him.

49:30.301 --> 49:33.513
What, a little brat?!

49:36.015 --> 49:37.934
You son of a bitch.

49:40.019 --> 49:41.813
You want to fight?

49:42.605 --> 49:45.274
Scared?

49:46.693 --> 49:51.990
Yeah...you ought to be scared...
That's why you ran away from your unit.

49:56.411 --> 49:58.204
You little bastard...

50:02.500 --> 50:05.211
Let's not make trouble in the village.

50:07.296 --> 50:09.799
You wanted it that way.

50:12.802 --> 50:16.305
Taek-gi, go in the room.

50:25.106 --> 50:28.109
Son of a bitch...

50:30.111 --> 50:31.988
I'll kill you!

50:32.405 --> 50:34.615
Just be calm

50:35.324 --> 50:36.200
Son of a...

50:36.325 --> 50:38.619
Have you forgotten your promise?

50:53.509 --> 50:56.012
Sparrow A1. Do you copy, over?

50:58.806 --> 51:01.684
Nest, this is Sparrow A1

51:01.809 --> 51:04.687
Sparrow A1 down
do you copy over?

51:04.812 --> 51:08.900
What's your name, mister?
I'm Dong-goo. Lee Dong-goo.

51:17.533 --> 51:18.910
Copy that.

51:19.702 --> 51:21.120
Sparrow A1?

51:21.204 --> 51:22.205
You're still alive?

51:22.330 --> 51:24.499
I said I'm Dong-goo!

51:24.582 --> 51:28.586
Answer a person
when they talk to you!

51:32.799 --> 51:36.010
Why are you yelling like that?

51:36.094 --> 51:37.804
What's your name?

51:39.097 --> 51:42.809
Wanna go some place interesting?

51:45.019 --> 51:49.107
Sparrow A1, Sparrow A1 ?
Sparrow A1!

51:51.400 --> 51:52.819
What a strange name!

51:52.902 --> 51:56.572
Then your family name is Seu?

52:04.705 --> 52:07.792
- Mr. Seu Miss, run!
- Oh shit!

52:19.804 --> 52:23.516
What happened to your face?

52:24.433 --> 52:25.434
Dong-goo?

52:25.518 --> 52:28.813
This big nosed mister,
you know his name?

52:28.938 --> 52:32.984
His name is Seu? Seu...

52:33.109 --> 52:34.986
That's right!! Seu Miss!

52:35.111 --> 52:38.906
Family name's Seu, and
his name is Miss.

52:38.990 --> 52:41.284
Seu Miss?

52:42.285 --> 52:45.288
Seu Miss?

52:45.413 --> 52:47.290
What did you tell them, kid?

52:47.415 --> 52:52.420
- Seu Miss?
- Yeah, I'm Smith. Yeah, my name.

52:53.421 --> 52:56.632
- Seu Miss!
- What?

52:57.008 --> 52:59.719
- Seu Miss?
- Seu Miss...

53:02.972 --> 53:04.390
What?

53:05.683 --> 53:07.685
What's so fun, kid?

53:07.810 --> 53:11.189
Make them stop.
Make them stop call my name like that.

53:12.481 --> 53:16.194
Seu Miss, me, Dal-soo!

53:16.819 --> 53:18.696
Na...what?

53:19.697 --> 53:22.116
His name's Seu Miss?

53:31.209 --> 53:37.173
It's almost 9 years since
Dong-goo's pa left home.

53:37.298 --> 53:41.510
Sure, he wanted to see
the outside world, but...

53:41.594 --> 53:45.514
I'm worried sick
Dong-goo will leave, too.

53:45.598 --> 53:51.896
We have to send the outsiders away
before something happens.

53:52.021 --> 53:56.901
If Dong-goo ends up leaving, too,
I'll die!

53:59.695 --> 54:01.113
Fermented bean curd!

54:17.797 --> 54:23.886
I'd be in Jongno
looking good right now...

54:24.011 --> 54:29.016
But those fools had to invade.
Now look at me!

54:29.100 --> 54:31.227
Who invaded who?

54:31.811 --> 54:34.021
You're the one who put the U.S. up front
and invaded us!

54:34.105 --> 54:38.317
Shut up, you don't know anything.

54:38.401 --> 54:44.782
- You mean we invaded South?
- Taeki-gi! That's enough.

54:44.907 --> 54:47.493
That fool keeps telling lies.

54:47.576 --> 54:49.412
Did we invade the South?

54:50.997 --> 54:53.207
We invaded the South.

54:54.292 --> 54:59.088
We did?

54:59.213 --> 55:01.090
See, you jerk?

55:03.426 --> 55:09.098
I just went south
because they told me to.

55:14.729 --> 55:20.401
Sparrow A1 down! Sparrow A1 down!
Sparrow A1 down!

01:00:04.602 --> 01:00:06.812
- Quick, get it!
- Tie it up!

01:00:10.899 --> 01:00:12.234
Mother!

01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:43.223
Thank you so much.

01:00:48.312 --> 01:00:49.980
Are you alright?

01:00:50.105 --> 01:00:51.774
Not a scratch!

01:00:52.107 --> 01:00:53.692
You're a brave boy!

01:01:21.303 --> 01:01:22.721
Second Lieutenant Pyo?

01:01:27.393 --> 01:01:31.605
How come these villagers
don't eat meat?

01:01:31.689 --> 01:01:33.982
It is because it caused them
so much nuisances?

01:01:34.108 --> 01:01:36.193
Why did they bury
such a great thing?

01:01:36.819 --> 01:01:38.195
Isn't that right,
Second Lieutenant Pyo?

01:01:40.489 --> 01:01:43.826
Back on base, they'd call me whenever
there were any pigs to butcher...

01:01:43.909 --> 01:01:45.494
Like that one, I would...

01:02:14.606 --> 01:02:16.108
Have a bite!

01:03:58.794 --> 01:04:00.003
Good, uh?

01:04:20.107 --> 01:04:22.109
Have some more, sir.

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:24.319
This tastes great!

01:04:42.504 --> 01:04:44.882
Hey, hey, let get inside quick.

01:05:22.294 --> 01:05:24.212
Looks good on you.

01:06:30.278 --> 01:06:36.118
Been so long since I had fat,
it just shoots right through me.

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:39.788
What's your name?

01:06:41.206 --> 01:06:43.417
I'm called Lee Soo-hwa.

01:06:53.719 --> 01:06:57.305
The medic comrade calls you
Second Lieutenant Pyo?

01:07:03.979 --> 01:07:06.606
Thanks for helping
our comrade before.

01:07:16.908 --> 01:07:19.995
How about we just pretend
to be comfortable and friendly?

01:07:40.599 --> 01:07:42.309
Let me ask you one thing.

01:07:44.102 --> 01:07:47.898
When we were sleeping...
...why did you let us be?

01:08:10.003 --> 01:08:13.507
These are the coordinates
of Captain Smith's last radio transmission.

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:15.884
Now that we can
verify the KPA unit,

01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:18.595
there is no reason
to delay the operation.

01:08:21.223 --> 01:08:22.515
He's guessing, sir.

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:25.227
I don't think we can make quick
decision based on ambiguous data.

01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:27.229
The allied forces
are moving north.

01:08:27.312 --> 01:08:30.314
We have to consider the fact that
our winning or losing depends on

01:08:30.398 --> 01:08:32.734
the ability to move
weapons and supplies.

01:08:32.818 --> 01:08:34.528
We are over-reacting.

01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:36.488
We need more time to investigate

01:08:38.698 --> 01:08:41.785
How can you say that.
Obviously, the enemy is there.

01:08:42.993 --> 01:08:44.787
There's a chance of
civilian casualty.

01:08:44.912 --> 01:08:47.707
We don't have the option
of being sympathetic

01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:50.001
And right now,
we don't have the time either.

01:08:57.008 --> 01:08:59.219
That is irresponsible.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:07.310
If we lose this passage, this war will last
much longer than we expected.

01:09:07.727 --> 01:09:10.104
China is on the way.

01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:17.904
You ready man?

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:34.712
You stay here.

01:09:34.796 --> 01:09:36.298
We run.

01:09:41.303 --> 01:09:43.095
Hey, stop there!

01:10:04.826 --> 01:10:06.328
Where did you get back?

01:10:41.029 --> 01:10:44.115
Look here.
There are many curious things.

01:10:45.533 --> 01:10:47.619
What is that cloud?

01:10:50.997 --> 01:10:53.500
I was big in the U.S. Army Club.

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:55.794
The girls loved me!

01:10:59.297 --> 01:11:01.883
Second Lieutenant Pyo, join us!

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:15.105
How is it that...

01:11:18.316 --> 01:11:24.072
...you have such a hold on the villagers
without ever raising your voice.

01:11:27.575 --> 01:11:32.289
What's the secret to
your great leadership?

01:11:37.002 --> 01:11:39.504
You just gotta feed them a lot.

01:11:41.214 --> 01:11:42.424
Sir?

01:12:59.834 --> 01:13:02.504
I can't do it now. Not now!

01:13:05.006 --> 01:13:07.509
You can't make that decision
so easily, sir!

01:13:07.592 --> 01:13:10.804
Are you kidding?
You know what needs to be done!

01:13:10.887 --> 01:13:13.598
The bridge is full of refugees!

01:13:13.681 --> 01:13:17.519
- Shut up and take it down!
- No, I tell you, no!

01:13:17.602 --> 01:13:21.398
You son of a bitch!
You want to kill all these people?

01:13:21.523 --> 01:13:23.691
- I can't!
- It's an order!

01:13:23.817 --> 01:13:25.819
Do it or I'll have you executed!

01:13:25.902 --> 01:13:30.532
How am I supposed to
kill all those...all those people?

01:13:30.615 --> 01:13:33.701
No! I can't!
How can I kill all of them!

01:13:33.827 --> 01:13:37.372
It's over if their tanks get over the Han River!
It's the end, you son of a bitch!

01:13:37.497 --> 01:13:40.083
- No way!
- Take it down! Now!

01:13:41.209 --> 01:13:43.795
This is an order!
Right now!

01:14:21.499 --> 01:14:27.922
Your mission is to rescue
Captain Neel Smith at all costs.

01:14:32.218 --> 01:14:36.014
An order is in place
to begin bombing your location,

01:14:36.097 --> 01:14:39.434
24 hours after
the mission has begun.

01:14:42.729 --> 01:14:47.192
So keep this in mind and
get out of there as soon as possible.

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:49.903
May the lord be with you all.

01:14:51.279 --> 01:14:52.989
Dismissed!

01:14:53.114 --> 01:14:55.116
Attention!

01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:56.409
Salute!

01:15:11.132 --> 01:15:14.928
There's a U.S. Army Club
in Jongno...

01:15:15.803 --> 01:15:18.181
It's my dream to become
the manager there...

01:15:20.183 --> 01:15:24.312
With a girl on each arm.

01:15:24.395 --> 01:15:25.813
Wouldn't that be great?

01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:30.193
But my father doesn't understand.

01:15:30.318 --> 01:15:33.821
You'll know how he feels
when you're a father, too.

01:15:33.905 --> 01:15:36.824
You sound just like him.

01:15:42.205 --> 01:15:44.207
Can I call you elder brother?

01:15:44.332 --> 01:15:47.001
You're too young. Call me uncle.

01:15:47.126 --> 01:15:49.003
Elder brother's better!

01:15:49.128 --> 01:15:50.672
You little pup!

01:15:50.797 --> 01:15:52.382
Really, it sounds more friendly.

01:15:52.507 --> 01:15:55.009
Do as you like, gosh!

01:15:55.093 --> 01:15:56.094
- Elder brother?
- What?

01:15:56.177 --> 01:15:58.304
I'm curious...

01:16:03.601 --> 01:16:05.395
The first day you saw us...

01:16:06.312 --> 01:16:08.523
Were you really gonna shoot me?

01:16:09.315 --> 01:16:12.902
Yeah, but the truth is,
I didn't have any bullets!

01:16:13.027 --> 01:16:15.822
- Fooled you!
- What? What? What did you say?

01:16:16.322 --> 01:16:19.117
No wonder you were
shaking like that!

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:21.911
How could I shoot you
without any bullets?

01:16:41.306 --> 01:16:43.016
High Comrade!

01:16:46.019 --> 01:16:50.231
Once the storage house is full...
...are we to leave?

01:16:57.196 --> 01:16:58.781
I guess we'd have to.

01:17:01.075 --> 01:17:02.785
Where would we go?

01:17:03.911 --> 01:17:07.498
If Pyongyang's taken and
the Allies are moving north...

01:17:07.582 --> 01:17:09.417
We have no place to go.

01:17:12.003 --> 01:17:14.922
Neither do we.

01:18:17.402 --> 01:18:19.320
Alright...here comes lunch!

01:18:19.987 --> 01:18:21.823
- It's here! It's finally here.
- Yeah!

01:18:24.492 --> 01:18:25.702
Oh, you've come.

01:18:25.827 --> 01:18:28.204
- Be careful now.
- Give it to me!

01:18:28.329 --> 01:18:30.331
It's fine, give it here.

01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:36.671
Give that to me, ma'am!

01:18:44.303 --> 01:18:46.180
They've done so much so soon!

01:18:46.305 --> 01:18:49.684
Yes, they're strong.

01:18:49.892 --> 01:18:51.811
That's not a good thing...

01:18:51.894 --> 01:18:55.690
Now that the storage is full,
they'll say they're leaving.

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:02.697
Thank you very much.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.791
The storage is full,
but we've nowhere to go...

01:19:16.085 --> 01:19:18.713
Maybe we should find
another grenade.

01:19:18.796 --> 01:19:22.300
A good toss into the storage house and
we'd be set for another few months.

01:19:22.717 --> 01:19:25.303
It's your fault
for working so hard.

01:19:25.386 --> 01:19:28.806
We're supposed to be soldiers, not farmers.
It doesn't look good.

01:19:29.307 --> 01:19:33.227
That storage house is too small.

01:19:33.311 --> 01:19:35.897
Let's rebuild it bigger.

01:19:36.022 --> 01:19:37.607
It's all bullshit.

01:19:37.732 --> 01:19:39.400
You're mocking me?

01:19:45.072 --> 01:19:47.408
Why don't you sing us a song?

01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:50.077
What? A song?

01:19:50.203 --> 01:19:51.996
- Yeah, come on.
- Nah!

01:19:52.079 --> 01:19:53.581
- Come on, sing us something.
- Come on!

01:19:53.706 --> 01:19:55.917
You put him on the spot, now he won't sing!
We shouldn't have put him on it

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.210
Right!

01:19:57.502 --> 01:19:59.003
Maybe just once.

01:20:04.926 --> 01:20:12.517
<i>A rolling rhythm...
And a sweet melody...</i>

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:19.982
<i>A boogie song is...
...a song of hope.</i>

01:20:20.107 --> 01:20:28.115
<i>Wipe away those sad tears...
Let's move ahead smiling.</i>

01:20:28.199 --> 01:20:35.414
<i>Stop looking surprised...
Let's sing a happy song.</i>

01:20:35.498 --> 01:20:39.293
<i>Let's sing...</i>

01:20:39.418 --> 01:20:42.797
<i>Boogie woogie...</i>

01:21:05.903 --> 01:21:09.824
<i>Let's sing...</i>

01:21:09.907 --> 01:21:13.327
<i>Boogie woogie...</i>

01:21:15.413 --> 01:21:17.707
- Seu Miss!
- Seu Miss!

01:21:17.832 --> 01:21:20.209
Try this on.

01:21:20.334 --> 01:21:23.004
- Will it fit?
- It'll fit.

01:21:23.796 --> 01:21:25.590
What if it doesn't?

01:21:25.673 --> 01:21:31.512
- It's for me?
- It fits well!

01:21:31.596 --> 01:21:36.893
<i>I'll move on singing my heart out!</i>

01:21:38.311 --> 01:21:40.313
That was great!

01:21:43.816 --> 01:21:45.318
Here some drink.

01:21:45.818 --> 01:21:48.696
What a good voice!

01:21:48.821 --> 01:21:52.533
- That's good. More, please!
- Yo, you are a drinker!

01:22:25.107 --> 01:22:26.317
Here some drink.

01:22:27.318 --> 01:22:31.781
I guess we'll have to go our separate ways.

01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:36.702
Although if we were to meet again in another war
we'd have to use our guns again.

01:22:41.082 --> 01:22:43.084
We won't meet again.

01:22:48.923 --> 01:22:50.591
I deserted.

01:22:53.094 --> 01:22:55.429
If I go back,
it's the firing squad for me.

01:22:57.223 --> 01:22:59.308
Since I can't go back to my unit...

01:23:00.017 --> 01:23:02.228
...we won't be using guns
on each other.

01:23:22.206 --> 01:23:23.416
Look at them.

01:23:25.710 --> 01:23:27.712
Such a good time.

01:23:27.795 --> 01:23:29.213
That's life.

01:24:01.495 --> 01:24:04.415
OK, listen up! It's time.

01:24:05.499 --> 01:24:07.710
Four minutes before drop.

01:24:09.003 --> 01:24:11.505
Now we will be landing
on the hot zone

01:24:11.589 --> 01:24:13.883
and the enemy will
outnumber us.

01:24:14.008 --> 01:24:17.511
They will not hesitate
to kill us violently.

01:24:17.595 --> 01:24:22.516
So let's be prepared
to land on the ground with the rifles firing.

01:24:23.893 --> 01:24:26.896
All right gentlemen, good luck.

01:24:29.607 --> 01:24:31.609
I'll see you on the ground.

01:24:33.694 --> 01:24:37.531
Go! Go! Go!

01:24:38.324 --> 01:24:41.035
Get your rifle. Go! Go!

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:17.298
Nest 1, this is Macpie A2.

01:26:17.423 --> 01:26:20.426
After drop zone, only five survived.

01:26:20.509 --> 01:26:23.387
Current coordinates,
Delta Hotel 4045.

01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:27.183
We found the wild dog,
we found the wild dog.

01:28:07.199 --> 01:28:10.577
He's looking at us.
Then greet him!

01:28:10.703 --> 01:28:12.288
I don't think that's it.

01:28:12.413 --> 01:28:17.793
If you meet a man's eyes,
you greet them!

01:28:17.918 --> 01:28:19.211
Come on, let's!

01:28:20.504 --> 01:28:22.298
Welcome!

01:28:25.009 --> 01:28:26.427
He's smiling.

01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:28.512
You think I'm fucking around.

01:28:30.431 --> 01:28:32.308
You think I'm fucking around?

01:28:32.599 --> 01:28:34.518
You think I'm playing games?

01:28:44.987 --> 01:28:48.282
Your fuck'n communist bastards
are driving my patience thin.

01:28:48.907 --> 01:28:51.994
I told you we shouldn't!

01:28:52.703 --> 01:28:54.288
Damn it!

01:29:22.399 --> 01:29:23.901
You bitch!

01:29:23.984 --> 01:29:26.195
You know what happens
when you get shot in the head?

01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:27.821
Spill it!

01:29:27.905 --> 01:29:29.907
Where are all the commie reds hiding?

01:29:34.411 --> 01:29:36.121
Damn girl, I'll kill you!

01:29:36.205 --> 01:29:37.831
She's crazy!

01:29:37.998 --> 01:29:40.125
You don't treat
a crazy girl like that!

01:29:55.682 --> 01:29:59.520
You sound like a Northerner.

01:30:01.397 --> 01:30:02.606
Uh?

01:30:05.192 --> 01:30:07.111
Sure you're from this village?

01:30:12.324 --> 01:30:14.034
Who are your parents?

01:30:18.872 --> 01:30:20.999
Has this kid no parents?

01:30:26.588 --> 01:30:28.298
- He's my son!
- He's mine!

01:30:42.104 --> 01:30:43.814
Why you...!

01:31:20.517 --> 01:31:22.227
He's this boy's father!

01:31:22.603 --> 01:31:23.479
Father!

01:31:23.604 --> 01:31:24.897
What do you want?

01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:28.400
Fuck are they saying?

01:31:37.493 --> 01:31:40.996
What are you so upset about?

01:31:41.413 --> 01:31:43.123
Why don't you calm down?

01:31:43.207 --> 01:31:45.792
Who do you think you are, bastard?

01:31:46.919 --> 01:31:49.129
Seat your fucking as down.

01:31:51.298 --> 01:31:54.426
Are you bastards playing with us?

01:31:55.719 --> 01:31:59.598
Has anyone among you seen any
commie reds or anti-aircraft guns?

01:32:02.309 --> 01:32:04.311
Come forward!

01:32:05.187 --> 01:32:06.980
No one?

01:32:26.333 --> 01:32:28.919
Still no one? Damned dogs...

01:32:31.296 --> 01:32:35.008
Listen up and watch closely...

01:32:36.885 --> 01:32:43.016
Until someone comes forward,
one by one, I'm gonna kill you all!

01:33:26.393 --> 01:33:27.519
Back off!

01:33:27.603 --> 01:33:30.022
No, wait, don't!
Please...

01:33:30.105 --> 01:33:31.607
Don't move!

01:33:32.899 --> 01:33:34.818
Don't move, asshole!

01:33:41.408 --> 01:33:43.076
Wait, just a second.

01:33:53.503 --> 01:33:54.504
Come on!

01:33:54.588 --> 01:33:56.590
Tie that bastard up!

01:33:58.300 --> 01:34:00.927
Village Chief, are you alright?

01:34:04.222 --> 01:34:05.724
Yeo-il!

01:34:07.934 --> 01:34:09.770
Yeo-il!
Yeo-il!

01:34:10.604 --> 01:34:12.105
What do we do?

01:34:13.899 --> 01:34:15.609
Dear, what do we do?

01:34:15.692 --> 01:34:19.279
Yeo-il! Hey, hey?

01:34:21.782 --> 01:34:23.700
It's hot...

01:34:24.409 --> 01:34:25.786
Yeo-il!

01:34:26.203 --> 01:34:27.913
Hot here.

01:34:29.790 --> 01:34:32.209
Yeo-il, Yeo-il!

01:34:37.714 --> 01:34:39.716
Hurts big...

01:34:41.927 --> 01:34:43.303
Yeo-il!

01:34:46.473 --> 01:34:47.683
Yeo-il!

01:34:50.477 --> 01:34:53.480
Child?

01:37:10.116 --> 01:37:11.493
Moon Sang-sang.

01:37:11.618 --> 01:37:14.496
- Search him.
- Yes, sir. Hold this, please.

01:37:16.122 --> 01:37:16.790
Stay still!

01:37:16.915 --> 01:37:20.418
What did you want up
in these mountains?

01:37:27.801 --> 01:37:29.135
What's this?

01:37:30.178 --> 01:37:32.389
We'll all die together...

01:37:32.472 --> 01:37:35.183
How's that? Alright?

01:37:36.810 --> 01:37:39.896
It'll be a sight to see
if they drop it all here.

01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:42.399
It's just villagers here!

01:37:44.109 --> 01:37:46.111
Tell the truth...

01:37:47.904 --> 01:37:49.322
Why'd you come?

01:37:50.198 --> 01:37:52.200
Talk, bastard!

01:37:52.325 --> 01:37:55.412
Never mind asking him.
Let's just bury him alive.

01:37:55.495 --> 01:37:58.331
Smith, hit him again with a rock!

01:37:59.207 --> 01:38:02.002
Did you call him Smith?

01:38:03.587 --> 01:38:05.505
How the hell do you know my name?

01:38:07.007 --> 01:38:08.675
Are you Smith?

01:38:09.509 --> 01:38:10.802
You?

01:38:11.678 --> 01:38:15.307
- Is that right?
- Yeah. Yeah, how do you know my name?

01:38:28.194 --> 01:38:32.532
How in the world did things.

01:38:37.579 --> 01:38:38.872
Hey, guys.

01:38:43.585 --> 01:38:45.211
I found something.

01:39:00.810 --> 01:39:07.400
Shouldn't this be enough
to decoy the bomb raid?

01:39:11.071 --> 01:39:14.074
It's not enough, but...

01:39:14.783 --> 01:39:17.494
If we work altogether,
it wouldn't be totally impossible.

01:39:18.495 --> 01:39:20.914
What? What do you mean?

01:39:20.997 --> 01:39:22.791
Work together on what?

01:39:23.708 --> 01:39:26.711
We know what would happen here,
you can't just sit by.

01:39:28.213 --> 01:39:32.008
We're third parties.
Why don't we mind our business...

01:39:32.092 --> 01:39:34.094
and just leave the village?

01:39:38.223 --> 01:39:40.517
Don't give me any orders.

01:39:41.101 --> 01:39:43.395
We're not from the same unit.

01:39:44.104 --> 01:39:45.897
I'll do as I want.

01:39:49.109 --> 01:39:50.610
High Comrade?

01:39:54.197 --> 01:39:56.491
We'd just decoy the bomb attack.

01:39:57.617 --> 01:40:00.203
We fire some warning shots and run.

01:40:01.121 --> 01:40:02.622
Nothing to it.

01:40:07.127 --> 01:40:08.503
Sang-sang, you think...

01:40:10.296 --> 01:40:15.802
...if you run away now and live,
you'll be at ease?

01:40:17.303 --> 01:40:21.099
You'd regret it all your life
and probably go crazy.

01:40:21.599 --> 01:40:23.685
I'd rather go crazy.

01:40:23.810 --> 01:40:27.480
You want to die like hell,
so it doesn't matter for you.

01:40:29.315 --> 01:40:31.818
But I'm not
interested at all!

01:40:39.826 --> 01:40:41.202
High Comrade.

01:40:43.997 --> 01:40:46.624
You know how we got here.

01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:50.378
The wounded and women comrades...

01:40:50.503 --> 01:40:53.006
I killed all those
that couldn't keep up.

01:40:55.675 --> 01:40:58.511
How do I face my family
back home?

01:40:58.803 --> 01:41:01.890
That was on orders from Command.

01:41:02.015 --> 01:41:05.185
How many people did we kill
on the way here?

01:41:06.102 --> 01:41:08.313
We can repay that debt now.

01:41:12.317 --> 01:41:13.818
Moon Sang-sang.

01:41:14.819 --> 01:41:16.905
I'm not going!

01:41:18.198 --> 01:41:19.699
If my family...

01:41:20.825 --> 01:41:22.994
Even if it were my own family
I couldn't do it.

01:41:34.214 --> 01:41:36.007
What are you waiting for, guys?

01:41:58.404 --> 01:42:00.198
Everything's screwed up!

01:42:20.718 --> 01:42:22.011
This operation...

01:42:23.930 --> 01:42:26.808
...how about Second Lieutenant Pyo
leading it?

01:42:31.688 --> 01:42:35.400
These damn weapons are
too new to me.

01:42:36.776 --> 01:42:38.611
Which, which is the front?

01:43:10.185 --> 01:43:16.107
Wretched offspring...Shouldn't come
if you're gonna leave.

01:43:17.108 --> 01:43:20.486
Blowing up all the corn...

01:44:02.028 --> 01:44:03.321
Look here!

01:44:17.293 --> 01:44:19.504
It'll be cold three or four days.

01:44:31.599 --> 01:44:33.226
Are you coming back?

01:44:44.570 --> 01:44:46.572
Mister Seu Miss!

01:46:05.318 --> 01:46:06.611
I have a favor to ask...

01:46:07.195 --> 01:46:10.323
Go back to your base with Smith.

01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:16.829
Smith, he asked me
to go back to the base with you.

01:46:18.122 --> 01:46:19.332
What?

01:46:20.208 --> 01:46:22.001
The base?

01:46:23.586 --> 01:46:27.799
No, I'm going
with you guys.

01:46:28.091 --> 01:46:30.176
We can try this once,

01:46:30.301 --> 01:46:32.678
but
if they attack the second time, it's over.

01:46:33.388 --> 01:46:35.807
Dongmakgol is in your hands.

01:46:35.890 --> 01:46:37.892
They'll believe you if you tell them.

01:46:39.102 --> 01:46:42.522
If the 2nd attack is happening,
there is no turning back.

01:46:42.605 --> 01:46:57.787
They're going to believe your word.

01:46:57.870 --> 01:47:00.289
I guess I don't have
much of a choice, do I?

01:47:07.505 --> 01:47:09.006
Take this.

01:47:22.395 --> 01:47:24.105
It's been good luck for me.

01:47:30.903 --> 01:47:32.780
Take care, guys!

01:47:37.577 --> 01:47:41.914
Their bombers will pass over us
at about 18:00.

01:47:44.792 --> 01:47:46.210
When they discover us...

01:47:46.294 --> 01:47:51.215
We have to expose ourselves to
look like an anti-aircraft base.

01:47:57.221 --> 01:47:59.599
The flight path on the map...

01:48:00.099 --> 01:48:03.269
...says they'll come
from that area in this direction.

01:48:03.686 --> 01:48:06.272
Your holes should be facing
11 o'clock and...

01:48:06.397 --> 01:48:11.110
MG50 and M630 should be placed
here and here.

01:48:11.986 --> 01:48:13.404
Next, Sergeant Jang...

01:48:13.988 --> 01:48:16.991
Set up the lanterns you brought...

01:48:17.116 --> 01:48:20.119
...to light up the decoy tents to look
like a village.

01:48:20.203 --> 01:48:21.913
They'll believe
it's an anti-aircraft base.

01:48:22.497 --> 01:48:27.001
Just in case this place
doesn't get noticed...

01:48:29.128 --> 01:48:31.506
...wire the TNT underground, too.

01:48:45.311 --> 01:48:48.397
No one's gonna care we did this.

01:48:48.981 --> 01:48:51.484
It's not too late.
Let's just leave!

01:48:51.609 --> 01:48:53.819
That's enough out of you little pup!

01:49:01.911 --> 01:49:04.205
You've got good command capability.

01:49:07.917 --> 01:49:10.002
You all helped so well.

01:49:12.505 --> 01:49:14.507
Why'd you yield command to me?

01:49:23.307 --> 01:49:26.310
I'm not suited to the vanguard.

01:49:29.397 --> 01:49:32.108
The war started and
everyone in my unit died...

01:49:34.318 --> 01:49:37.613
I got a commanding rank
for surviving alone.

01:49:42.410 --> 01:49:44.495
You're a born leader.

01:49:48.374 --> 01:49:50.001
Does it look that way?

01:49:52.003 --> 01:49:53.379
That's good.

01:50:01.304 --> 01:50:02.888
Listen to me!

01:50:03.014 --> 01:50:06.517
How can the five of us stop
a plane in the sky?

01:50:11.522 --> 01:50:14.317
- Everyone to their positions!
- We don't have time!

01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:17.570
- You said there was time!
- Shut up and get moving!

01:50:38.299 --> 01:50:39.717
Until the bomber...

01:50:40.718 --> 01:50:45.514
is within shooting range
we must stay put!

01:50:47.808 --> 01:50:49.018
Elder brother.

01:50:50.978 --> 01:50:52.605
Come on over here!

01:50:54.607 --> 01:50:57.610
Little pup, scared?

01:51:01.697 --> 01:51:03.616
Stay here.

01:51:09.789 --> 01:51:11.624
Moon Sang-sang.

01:51:12.708 --> 01:51:16.504
Sing that song again
from yesterday.

01:51:17.213 --> 01:51:19.632
You want me to sing here, now?

01:51:22.301 --> 01:51:24.387
Come on, try!

01:51:31.811 --> 01:51:35.898
<i>A rolling rhythm...</i>

01:51:37.108 --> 01:51:40.486
<i>And a sweet melody...</i>

01:51:43.489 --> 01:51:46.826
<i>A boogie song is...</i>

01:51:49.412 --> 01:51:52.415
<i>... a song of hope.</i>

01:51:54.417 --> 01:51:58.796
<i>Wipe away those sad tears...</i>

01:52:05.261 --> 01:52:07.680
Eagle2, Report current status over.

01:52:07.805 --> 01:52:08.889
Roger.

01:52:09.598 --> 01:52:13.185
We don't see any enemy movement
at the current position, over.

01:52:38.586 --> 01:52:39.795
By the way...

01:52:41.380 --> 01:52:45.009
Aren't we allied forces, too?

01:52:48.721 --> 01:52:52.308
We're a North-South Joint Force,
aren't we?

01:52:53.225 --> 01:52:55.019
Am I wrong?

01:52:55.102 --> 01:52:59.023
You can joke
at a time like this?

01:52:59.106 --> 01:53:00.399
That makes sense!

01:53:07.573 --> 01:53:09.408
Instead of like this...

01:53:11.410 --> 01:53:17.208
If we had met somewhere else
some other way...

01:53:17.291 --> 01:53:20.085
We would have had real fun.

01:53:21.212 --> 01:53:22.588
Don't you think so?

01:53:35.309 --> 01:53:36.769
It's now!

01:54:01.126 --> 01:54:02.920
I think that was enough.

01:54:03.003 --> 01:54:05.297
Yeah, that should be enough.

01:54:05.422 --> 01:54:07.007
Then let's run!

01:54:16.976 --> 01:54:19.395
Damn it, they didn't see us!

01:54:24.984 --> 01:54:26.485
Nest A-1, Nest A-1.

01:54:26.610 --> 01:54:28.487
This is Sparrow05.

01:54:28.612 --> 01:54:32.825
From our current position,
we have detected enemy movements.

01:54:32.908 --> 01:54:35.828
I'm on my way down.
Check it out, over.

01:54:44.378 --> 01:54:45.880
Gotcha.

01:55:45.397 --> 01:55:46.732
Taek-gi!

01:56:43.122 --> 01:56:44.289
Sang-sang!

01:57:58.906 --> 01:58:00.699
Hurry, come on.

01:58:05.788 --> 01:58:07.289
Take cover!

01:58:20.094 --> 01:58:22.012
Come on, enough already!

02:00:12.414 --> 02:00:14.333
Elder brother! Elder Brother!

02:00:17.669 --> 02:00:18.879
Brother!

02:00:24.384 --> 02:00:25.594
Elder brother!

02:00:29.514 --> 02:00:31.099
Little pup!

02:00:34.311 --> 02:00:37.022
I'm...fine...

02:00:47.199 --> 02:00:48.700
Elder brother...

02:01:20.232 --> 02:01:22.901
You damn bastards!

02:01:36.915 --> 02:01:39.918
Take cover! Take cover!

02:01:40.002 --> 02:01:41.420
Take cover!

02:02:36.391 --> 02:02:38.810
One minute to drop zone, deadline.

02:02:43.315 --> 02:02:46.401
Nest A-1, Nest A-1. We are in hot zone.

02:02:46.485 --> 02:02:50.405
Repeat EO 1, 2 and 3 are in the hot zone.

02:02:50.697 --> 02:02:53.492
Mission has been initiated.

02:02:53.992 --> 02:02:56.328
One minute to engage.
