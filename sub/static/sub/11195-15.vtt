00:06.048 --> 00:08.090
(Stargate alarm)

00:11.929 --> 00:15.265
- Report.
- It's SG-1 , sir. They're under fire.

00:18.435 --> 00:22.022
Colonel O'Neill, this is General Hammond.
Report status.

00:22.147 --> 00:24.441
(O'Neill) We're pinned down.

00:24.525 --> 00:29.488
Carter was able to dial the gate.
We're trying to get clear to come through.

00:29.571 --> 00:31.615
Open the iris.

00:37.621 --> 00:39.665
Evacuate the gate room.

00:44.419 --> 00:47.756
Colonel O'Neill, we're taking fire. Report.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.221
Colonel O'Neill.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.267
Sir?

00:59.101 --> 01:01.311
Give them some more time.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074

01:23.375 --> 01:28.088
So, essentially, we were ambushed
on the way back to the gate.

01:28.213 --> 01:31.717
- We almost didn't make it out.
- If you'd been longer, you wouldn't have.

01:31.842 --> 01:36.305
- I was about to close the iris.
- Considering the SGC was taking fire,...

01:36.430 --> 01:39.224
..we're glad you waited
as long as you did, sir.

01:39.308 --> 01:44.354
Strictly speaking, if I'd followed
procedure, you'd all be dead right now.

01:44.438 --> 01:48.275
Well, sir, every time we go through
the Stargate, it's a calculated risk.

01:48.400 --> 01:53.614
I realise that, Major. But I'm getting tired
of sending good people out there,...

01:53.739 --> 01:56.992
..never knowing
if they're going to come back.

01:57.075 --> 01:59.036
I've had enough.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.331
I'm sorry, sir. What are you saying?

02:03.749 --> 02:06.835
I wanted you all to be the first to know.

02:06.960 --> 02:10.964
Effective immediately, I'm stepping down
as commander of the SGC.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.256
Come to see me off, Colonel?

03:34.339 --> 03:37.259
Nope. I've come to talk you out of this.

03:38.093 --> 03:41.180
- Thank you. You can finish later.
- Yes, sir.

03:45.434 --> 03:49.104
Jack, weren't you there
for my goodbye speech?

03:49.188 --> 03:51.648
Yes, I was, of course. You know that.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.818
And it was lovely, General.

03:54.943 --> 04:00.949
But do you think I believe you're quitting
because we ran into a little trouble?

04:01.074 --> 04:03.994
Hell, we've been presumed dead before.

04:05.621 --> 04:08.957
I don't have to
explain myself to you, Colonel.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.753
No, sir, you don't.
You're my commanding officer.

04:12.836 --> 04:15.547
But could you throw me a bone?

04:15.631 --> 04:18.007
Jack, this has been a long time coming.

04:18.132 --> 04:21.094
I'm asking you to
respect my decision and accept it.

04:21.178 --> 04:24.348
When I took over this command,
the Stargate was inactive.

04:24.431 --> 04:28.101
This was supposed to be an easy
assignment on my way to retiring.

04:28.185 --> 04:31.271
General, need I remind you
that I was retired?

04:32.981 --> 04:36.318
Some things are worth
changing your plans for.

04:37.027 --> 04:39.696
I've had enough.

04:48.914 --> 04:52.835
Let me just say it's been
a pleasure serving with all of you.

04:53.961 --> 04:56.004
We'll miss you, sir.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.514
It won't be the same without you, sir.

05:10.269 --> 05:14.648
On Chulak, when a great warrior retires
from battle, we sing a song of lament.

05:19.611 --> 05:21.655
Fortunately we are not on Chulak.

05:27.578 --> 05:29.621
Take care of yourself.

05:41.884 --> 05:44.595
(Carter) So what do we know
about this new guy?

05:44.678 --> 05:45.846
Not much.

05:45.929 --> 05:48.765
I hope he's not a spit-and-polish,
brass tacks...

05:48.849 --> 05:51.518
- Hard-ass?
- I was building up to that.

05:51.602 --> 05:53.645
Ten hut!

05:58.317 --> 06:01.069
My name is Major General Bauer.

06:01.153 --> 06:03.530
I'll be your new commanding officer.

06:03.655 --> 06:09.077
I'd just like to say I look forward to
working with all of you. Thank you.

06:19.963 --> 06:22.007
Squadron, at ease!

06:26.220 --> 06:29.306
Always leave 'em wanting more... I guess.

06:32.351 --> 06:36.104
I guess I just was expecting
someone a little more... inspiring.

06:36.188 --> 06:39.441
Spend time at the Pentagon and
it's easy to become a bureaucrat.

06:39.525 --> 06:41.818
(Bauer) Or a politician.

06:43.278 --> 06:45.989
Depends on where your interests lie.

06:46.073 --> 06:49.076
- General, l...
- At ease, Major Carter.

06:50.202 --> 06:55.165
I've been going over your research
into naqahdah reactors.

06:55.290 --> 06:57.084
Very impressive.

06:57.209 --> 07:00.379
Large-scale application is
mostly theoretical right now,...

07:00.504 --> 07:03.507
..but the mineral shows
great potential as a power source.

07:03.590 --> 07:08.470
It shows interesting properties when used
in conjunction with nuclear ordnance.

07:10.597 --> 07:14.434
Well, it does tend to increase
the explosive effect. Yes, sir.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.939
The Pentagon feels
that the Stargate project,...

07:19.022 --> 07:23.151
..while exposing Earth to great danger,
has yet to produce any practical returns.

07:23.235 --> 07:25.529
We've been working on a device...

07:25.654 --> 07:28.991
..to take advantage of this
naqahdah-enhancing effect.

07:29.074 --> 07:32.494
I'd like you to take part in the operation.

07:32.911 --> 07:36.165
- What about my duties with SG-1?
- You've been reassigned.

07:36.248 --> 07:38.792
- What?
- As have you, Dr Jackson.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.588
An archaeologist has
no place on a frontline unit.

07:42.671 --> 07:45.674
You'll be a consultant,
going off world only as required.

07:45.799 --> 07:49.970
- General Bauer...
- The decision has been made, Major.

07:53.348 --> 07:54.975
I suggest you get to work.

08:07.196 --> 08:09.239
(Bauer) Come.

08:11.533 --> 08:13.911
- Colonel O'Neill.
- General.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.164
Thank you, Kim.

08:18.457 --> 08:21.627
I've just been going through
your mission reports.

08:24.463 --> 08:26.924
- Yes, sir?
- They're satisfactory.

08:27.007 --> 08:30.761
You might want to include
bullet-point summaries with each section.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.138
Makes for an easier read.

08:35.474 --> 08:37.934
Bullet-point summaries?

08:38.559 --> 08:41.020
Is there a problem with that?

08:41.980 --> 08:48.153
General, I realise the format
of my reports is of vital importance...

08:48.237 --> 08:51.823
..and, if you'd like, someday
we can talk about fonts and margins.

08:51.949 --> 08:57.496
But now I'd like to discuss why you're
dismantling my team without discussion.

08:57.955 --> 09:02.000
General Hammond may have allowed you
a certain latitude in his presence,...

09:02.084 --> 09:04.920
..but you'd do well
to watch your tone with me.

09:07.172 --> 09:10.175
General Hammond
kept us together for a reason.

09:10.259 --> 09:13.595
The fact is, if it wasn't for SG-1 ,...

09:13.679 --> 09:16.640
..right now you'd be sittin'
with a snake in your head,...

09:16.723 --> 09:20.310
- ..instead of your head up your a...
- Colonel!

09:22.646 --> 09:25.107
No one around here is above reproach.

09:25.524 --> 09:28.485
If it continues,
your long history of insubordination...

09:28.569 --> 09:33.949
..will come to a swift and unspectacular
end under my command, I assure you.

09:37.327 --> 09:42.666
Now I suggest you take some time
to think things over.

09:43.959 --> 09:48.088
Decide if you still want to be
a part of this operation.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.299
Dismissed.

10:13.906 --> 10:16.825
- Hello, Jack. Come on in.
- General.

10:19.745 --> 10:22.206
Good to see you're keepin' busy.

10:23.332 --> 10:25.375
Have a seat.

10:26.752 --> 10:30.088
- What are you doing?
- A little vacation.

10:31.590 --> 10:37.179
- Didn't you just take some time off?
- Yeah. This one wasn't by choice.

10:37.596 --> 10:40.599
Not everyone is gonna be
as patient with you as I was.

10:44.228 --> 10:45.854
That's why I'm here, sir.

10:47.481 --> 10:51.652
- Bit of a rough adjustment?
- Oh, no. Everything's fine.

10:52.778 --> 10:55.322
SG-1's been dismantled,...

10:55.447 --> 10:58.700
..Daniel's got a desk job,
Teal'c's with SG-3...

10:58.825 --> 11:03.455
..and Carter's working on some kind of
doomsday machine. Same old, same old.

11:03.789 --> 11:06.875
- Are you serious?
- For once, yes.

11:08.585 --> 11:12.256
It's going to take time to get used
to the man. I'm sure he's competent.

11:12.381 --> 11:14.925
Come on, General!

11:15.050 --> 11:18.720
I've never met anyone who liked
doing what they do more than you.

11:18.804 --> 11:21.098
And you were good at it. Great.

11:22.391 --> 11:27.187
You'll never convince me
you just got fed up. I'll never buy that.

11:27.312 --> 11:30.065
I'm sorry. It's out of my hands, Jack.

11:32.609 --> 11:35.696
- What does that mean?
- I can't discuss it.

11:37.656 --> 11:39.241
General?

11:41.869 --> 11:43.996
You don't understand.

11:44.079 --> 11:47.499
And I won't... unless you explain it to me.

11:54.506 --> 11:59.136
Two weeks ago, I was contacted
by a representative of the NID.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.723
He suggested I should become
more aggressive in my policies.

12:02.848 --> 12:04.892
They have no jurisdiction over you.

12:05.017 --> 12:08.103
They wanted to gain access
to offworld technology,...

12:08.228 --> 12:12.065
..which they're unable to do since
we shut down their side operation.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.943
- You told 'em to go to hell?
- Of course.

12:15.068 --> 12:20.032
Then he told me, if I didn't cooperate,
there would be consequences.

12:20.115 --> 12:22.951
The next day, two men in plain clothes,...

12:23.035 --> 12:28.373
..driving a black, unmarked car,
picked up my granddaughters at school.

12:29.458 --> 12:31.919
- I don't believe it.
- They took them for a ride,...

12:32.044 --> 12:36.507
..then brought them home.
The girls were fine, but I got the message.

12:38.133 --> 12:41.970
We're talking about an organisation
as powerful as the CIA.

12:42.054 --> 12:47.476
These people are above the law.
I can't protect my family 24 hours a day.

12:47.559 --> 12:49.603
I had no choice.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.147
Of course not.

12:56.568 --> 13:00.322
Don't get yourself
into trouble over this, Jack.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.160
You know me, sir.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.648
Jack O'Neill.

13:35.524 --> 13:37.818
What a pleasant surprise.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.042
At ease.

13:54.585 --> 13:56.879
How are things progressing, Major?

13:57.004 --> 14:01.800
The hardware's almost ready. But it's
the ratio of naqahdah to lithium hydride.

14:01.925 --> 14:06.388
We don't have enough weapons-grade
material to complete the bomb.

14:06.513 --> 14:10.350
- Then we'll have to get some more.
- We're talking about refined naqahdah.

14:10.475 --> 14:13.896
- It's extremely rare.
- Not on P3S-452.

14:14.313 --> 14:17.983
- That planet is a Goa'uld stronghold.
- I realise that.

14:18.525 --> 14:22.905
I'm confident a well-armed strike force
can get the job done.

14:28.702 --> 14:32.956
Nice of you to come by.
I don't get a lot of visitors.

14:33.040 --> 14:37.211
- I find that hard to believe.
- In my line of work,...

14:37.294 --> 14:40.255
..people don't stick by you
through thick and thin.

14:40.339 --> 14:44.635
Most of my associates are busy
trying to forget they ever knew me.

14:45.802 --> 14:49.306
Your former associates are why I'm here.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.226
They're causing some problems
for a friend of mine.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.145
General Hammond.

14:56.104 --> 14:59.274
- What do you know?
- Why should I tell you?

15:00.317 --> 15:02.110
Because I can help you.

15:02.236 --> 15:06.156
I've been convicted of treason.
What can you do?

15:07.741 --> 15:10.577
Air Force One and I go way back.

15:12.955 --> 15:16.625
- I suppose I'll have to trust you.
- I wasn't gonna say it.

15:17.167 --> 15:22.047
It's very simple. When you shut down the
offworld operation with the second gate...

15:22.172 --> 15:25.509
..you cut off the NID's
access to alien technology.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.636
So they sent you to work for the Russians.

15:27.761 --> 15:30.514
The Pentagon made the Russians
deep-six their gate...

15:30.597 --> 15:34.351
..in exchange for continued sharing
of information and technology.

15:34.476 --> 15:37.396
- We have the only operational gate.
- Exactly.

15:37.479 --> 15:42.526
The NID thinks Hammond and the policies
of the Stargate programme are too soft.

15:43.277 --> 15:45.320
So this Bauer guy is part of it?

15:45.863 --> 15:50.492
Truth is, I don't know.
I been out of the loop for a little while.

15:50.576 --> 15:52.953
But it's possible he's just a patsy,...

15:53.078 --> 15:58.292
..unwillingly manoeuvred into position
because he's got the right mentality.

15:58.417 --> 16:03.297
- All sounds so cloak-and-daggery.
- They're a special ops, Colonel Jack.

16:03.422 --> 16:05.549
Why do you pretend to smell like roses?

16:05.674 --> 16:10.721
Hey! I never threatened a two-star general
by kidnapping his grandkids.

16:10.846 --> 16:13.557
Don't pretend to be so naive, either.

16:18.896 --> 16:23.358
- How do I get him to back off?
- You really wanna play in my sandbox?

16:24.026 --> 16:27.362
- Tell me what I have to do.
- Quid pro quo, Jack.

16:30.574 --> 16:35.913
You're facing the death penalty.
The best I can do is put in a good word,...

16:35.996 --> 16:39.833
..maybe recommend
they commute your sentence to life.

16:39.917 --> 16:42.294
You'll have to do a lot more than that.

16:42.377 --> 16:44.922
I can get you the information you need.

16:45.047 --> 16:49.760
Names. Proof of certain influential
people's involvement with the NID.

16:51.553 --> 16:54.181
- Keep talkin'.
- My word is useless.

16:54.389 --> 16:59.436
You want hard evidence, you're gonna
have to get me outta here for a few days.

16:59.728 --> 17:01.688
Are you nuts?

17:01.772 --> 17:05.108
Do you know how many strings
I'd have to pull to make that happen?

17:05.192 --> 17:07.319
One big one.

17:07.402 --> 17:11.240
I know you're prepared to do it, Jack,
or you wouldn't be here.

17:11.323 --> 17:14.492
I won't bother to say "You can trust me."

17:21.083 --> 17:23.126
(Stargate alarm)

17:24.670 --> 17:27.839
Receiving transmission, sir.
It's SG-3's iris code.

17:27.964 --> 17:30.342
Open the iris.

17:50.654 --> 17:53.031
Where's Major Wade?

17:53.574 --> 17:54.741
Dead.

17:55.450 --> 17:57.995
- What happened?
- We met heavy resistance.

17:58.078 --> 18:02.541
- Lieutenant Morrison gave cover fire...
- What about the naqahdah?

18:02.624 --> 18:06.211
- I believe I secured a sufficient amount.
- Excellent.

18:06.336 --> 18:09.256
You can give me your full briefing later.

18:10.632 --> 18:13.886
(medic) I've stopped the bleeding.
Get him to the infirmary.

18:30.819 --> 18:33.030
Have you heard of IKEA?

18:33.155 --> 18:38.785
You ought to feel privileged, Jack. No one,
not even the NID, knows about this place.

18:41.455 --> 18:43.665
"Charles Bliss"?

18:43.790 --> 18:46.251
Now you know
one of a hundred names I go by.

18:49.505 --> 18:53.675
I see you're on that famous beer and
mustard diet. How's that workin' out?

18:53.759 --> 18:55.802
No, thanks.

19:06.480 --> 19:12.110
If anyone tries to boot the computer up
without this disk, the whole thing fries.

19:18.283 --> 19:21.954
- What are you doin'?
- Accessing NID files on the lnternet.

19:23.580 --> 19:27.251
- On the lnternet?
- The organisation is made up of cells.

19:27.334 --> 19:31.255
They communicate with each other
by accessing bulletin boards on line.

19:31.338 --> 19:35.717
Information is deposited on any number
of firewall-protected floating servers...

19:35.843 --> 19:38.929
..and accessed using
decoding software and passwords.

19:39.054 --> 19:42.140
Yada-yada, blah-blah.
Why'd we have to come here for this?

19:42.266 --> 19:46.478
Because the decoding software
happens to be on this computer.

19:52.317 --> 19:56.613
- They've deactivated my password.
- There's a shocker(!)

19:56.697 --> 19:59.616
I'll try to hack in through the back door.

20:01.827 --> 20:07.416
The naqahdah from P3S-452 has been
successfully incorporated into the device.

20:07.499 --> 20:09.543
I'm glad to hear it.

20:10.460 --> 20:12.754
Here's the test site.

20:20.846 --> 20:24.099
- This planet has plant and animal life.
- Yes.

20:25.350 --> 20:30.397
But the aerial survey shows no signs
of habitation within 50 miles of the gate.

20:30.480 --> 20:33.025
That may not be good enough.

20:33.442 --> 20:36.236
I'll need some time
to run some simulations.

20:37.154 --> 20:42.117
We've never done this before and I'm not
sure how destructive this device will be.

20:42.242 --> 20:46.371
Major, the whole point
of the experiment is to determine...

20:46.455 --> 20:49.374
..how destructive the device will be.

20:50.334 --> 20:52.794
Request denied.

20:53.295 --> 20:56.381
- But sir...
- Proceed with the preparations.

20:57.591 --> 20:59.635
Yes, sir.

21:00.469 --> 21:02.095
Jack...

21:02.221 --> 21:06.850
Once you get the information to link
key names to the NID, what will you do?

21:08.018 --> 21:11.188
- What do you think?
- You'll turn it over to the Pentagon...

21:11.271 --> 21:14.525
..and hope the proper chain of command
leads to justice.

21:18.320 --> 21:23.033
- You tryin' to tell me somethin', Harry?
- You can't take down the entire NID.

21:23.158 --> 21:27.704
- And they'll kill you for trying.
- That wouldn't be very nice.

21:27.788 --> 21:33.085
You might be able to hold the evidence
over them and get Hammond reinstated.

21:35.379 --> 21:38.882
- So I should sit on this?
- It's your play.

21:43.554 --> 21:44.721
Damn!

21:45.222 --> 21:47.266
(vehicle approaches)

21:52.229 --> 21:56.608
I thought you said
nobody knew about this place.

21:56.692 --> 22:00.112
They've probably been tracing me
since I went on line.

22:00.195 --> 22:03.198
- You got a way outta here?
- Give me a second.

22:03.323 --> 22:06.660
- What are you doin'?
- Burning the hard drive.

22:30.976 --> 22:33.020
(hollow knock)

22:52.539 --> 22:53.707
Nice!

22:53.832 --> 22:56.126
And... a nice try to you.

23:04.885 --> 23:06.386
We're ready, sir.

23:10.724 --> 23:14.144
First observation MALP is in position.

23:14.269 --> 23:16.813
Prepare to send the bomb through.

23:17.981 --> 23:20.025
Seal it up.

23:23.487 --> 23:25.864
Yeah, Daniel. How are things at camp?

23:25.948 --> 23:28.659
Um... not good.

23:28.742 --> 23:31.829
General Bauer's testing
his new naqahdah bomb.

23:31.912 --> 23:35.165
He's taking short cuts which
Sam thinks could be disastrous.

23:35.249 --> 23:40.921
Maybourne claims he doesn't know
if Bauer's NID or just a gung ho patsy.

23:41.046 --> 23:42.923
Either way, he's dangerous.

23:43.048 --> 23:46.552
Hang in there and do what you can.
I'll check back.

23:54.017 --> 23:56.061
You want one?

23:57.020 --> 24:00.941
No. There's still something about you
that puts me off my food.

24:01.024 --> 24:04.528
I know you've got a strong stomach, Jack.
I read your file.

24:05.779 --> 24:08.323
Now what does that
have to do with anything?

24:08.448 --> 24:12.035
You wanna help General Hammond,
you have to get your hands dirty.

24:12.119 --> 24:14.496
Are you willing to see this thing through?

24:14.580 --> 24:18.333
Under no other circumstances
would I sit here and watch you eat.

24:18.458 --> 24:22.921
Yeah, well, things are about to get
a lot more dicey. They're onto us.

24:23.046 --> 24:26.717
Our only chance now is
a more direct approach.

24:26.842 --> 24:27.843
Such as?

24:27.968 --> 24:31.805
We have to connect someone with
influence to the on-line websites.

24:31.889 --> 24:37.102
The only way to do that now is straight
through one of the high-profile associates.

24:37.186 --> 24:39.229
Who are we talkin' about here?

24:39.313 --> 24:41.356
An old friend.

24:49.531 --> 24:52.075
50 minutes to target location, sir.

24:55.037 --> 24:58.624
- We have to stop the test.
- Why is that?

24:58.707 --> 25:01.668
The aerial survey shows evidence
of an old Goa'uld mine.

25:01.752 --> 25:04.296
It's probably been shut
for thousands of years,...

25:04.421 --> 25:07.132
..but there could still be
a lot of naqahdah present.

25:07.216 --> 25:09.968
Our soil samples
indicate only minute traces.

25:10.052 --> 25:12.930
The geological survey I read
said there was none.

25:13.013 --> 25:18.769
- We're not stopping the test.
- You don't realise the implications of this.

25:19.478 --> 25:21.522
Or maybe you do.

25:24.441 --> 25:28.612
- Are you making an accusation, Major?
- You knew all along, didn't you?

25:30.489 --> 25:34.493
You were hoping for a chain reaction
with the naqahdah in the soil.

25:34.576 --> 25:39.998
- That entire planet could be destroyed.
- The possibility has been considered.

25:41.625 --> 25:44.795
Most Goa'uld worlds have
a high incidence of naqahdah.

25:44.878 --> 25:48.131
This would be a very effective
weapon against them.

25:48.257 --> 25:51.218
There's only one problem, sir.
When that bomb goes off,...

25:51.301 --> 25:54.388
..we'll still be connected
to the planet by the Stargate.

25:54.471 --> 25:59.685
Radiation, gravitation and time distortion
has come back through a wormhole.

25:59.768 --> 26:02.646
I am told we should be able
to get just enough data...

26:02.729 --> 26:06.149
..before the Stargate is destroyed
and the wormhole disconnected.

26:06.275 --> 26:10.112
- Who provided this intelligence?
- That is not your concern.

26:10.195 --> 26:14.199
Sir, we've seen the Stargate
survive a direct hit from a meteorite.

26:14.283 --> 26:16.493
We have no way of knowing
what might happen.

26:16.618 --> 26:20.664
A risk assessment has been made
and it was deemed acceptable.

26:20.747 --> 26:22.457
End of discussion.

26:35.095 --> 26:38.432
- How long have you known the guy?
- We go way back.

26:49.651 --> 26:52.362
- Looks like a party.
- (rings doorbell)

26:55.949 --> 26:57.993
- Yes?
- Please tell the senator...

26:58.118 --> 27:01.371
..Colonel Maybourne and
Colonel O'Neill would like to see him.

27:01.497 --> 27:04.917
- He has guests.
- Tell him he has two more.

27:08.086 --> 27:13.467
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Our invitations must be lost in the mail.

27:13.550 --> 27:15.010
This is not a good time.

27:15.093 --> 27:18.055
- Who is it, dear?
- A couple of old friends.

27:18.138 --> 27:23.018
Afternoon, ma'am. I'm Mr Starsky.
This is... Hutch.

27:23.101 --> 27:25.145
Well, come in, come in.

27:35.322 --> 27:38.408
We're just having a little get-together.

27:43.956 --> 27:45.999
Oscar, down.

27:46.083 --> 27:48.126
It's all right.

27:49.545 --> 27:51.588
He seems to like you, Mr Starsky.

27:51.713 --> 27:53.841
Birds of a feather, ma'am.

27:53.966 --> 27:57.469
Dear, Starsky & Hutch is an old TV show.

27:57.594 --> 28:00.472
Oh! You're actors, then?

28:03.642 --> 28:06.353
Maybe we'd better go up to my study.

28:07.312 --> 28:09.189
This won't take long.

28:21.910 --> 28:24.288
The weapon is in position.

28:39.720 --> 28:42.097
- What happened?
- We've lost transmission.

28:42.639 --> 28:45.267
The observation MALP was destroyed.

28:47.394 --> 28:49.688
The wormhole did not disconnect.

28:49.813 --> 28:54.526
Sir, I'm picking up increasing
levels of radiation in the gate room.

28:55.194 --> 28:59.448
- Gamma rays, ultrahigh frequency.
- Shut down the gate!

29:02.159 --> 29:05.829
No response.
Radiation levels approaching critical.

29:05.954 --> 29:07.998
Close the iris.

29:12.252 --> 29:13.795
Radiation decreasing.

29:13.879 --> 29:17.132
(Carter) lf the iris succumbs
to the heat and loses integrity,...

29:17.257 --> 29:21.553
..there will be no way to stop radiation
bombarding the base. We must evacuate.

29:21.637 --> 29:24.014
We were sure the other gate
would be destroyed.

29:24.097 --> 29:26.225
Sir, we have to act now.

29:33.941 --> 29:35.567
Attention all personnel.

29:35.651 --> 29:39.863
By order of General Bauer, commence
immediate evacuation of the base.

29:39.947 --> 29:43.700
Repeat: immediate evacuation.
This is not a drill.

29:45.452 --> 29:49.915
We can monitor the gate
from a security station on level 16.

29:49.998 --> 29:53.585
- What's going to happen, Major?
- I have no way of knowing that, sir.

29:56.255 --> 29:59.591
I guess your risk assessment
didn't cover this.

30:09.268 --> 30:13.564
Gentlemen, I have the undersecretary
of state, the governor of Maryland...

30:13.647 --> 30:18.777
..and half the United States congress
in my living room, so let's make it quick.

30:18.902 --> 30:22.239
What in God's name
can I possibly do for you?

30:22.364 --> 30:24.491
We need some information on the NID.

30:25.742 --> 30:26.994
The NID?

30:28.579 --> 30:34.501
Snaky government agency involved in
all sorts of illegal covert operations.

30:34.626 --> 30:37.546
Like blackmailing air-force generals.

30:39.214 --> 30:44.094
You are making less and less sense to me
as the seconds are passing away,...

30:44.178 --> 30:45.804
..along with my patience.

30:45.929 --> 30:50.017
So you're not aware of all the money
they gave to your re-election campaign?

30:50.100 --> 30:54.980
If you question my campaign finances,
tell the federal elections commission.

30:55.105 --> 30:59.568
- That's just the tip of the iceberg.
- Aren't you supposed to be in prison?

30:59.693 --> 31:01.987
Colonel O'Neill asked the president...

31:02.112 --> 31:06.658
..to help me dig up some information
about my former associates.

31:08.160 --> 31:10.287
And you trust this man?

31:12.623 --> 31:14.583
No.

31:14.666 --> 31:20.297
I'm sorry, General, but this conversation
has lost all amusement for me.

31:20.380 --> 31:23.383
- I have a party to get back to.
- We're not goin' anywhere.

31:25.511 --> 31:28.764
- Excuse me?
- I'm not leavin' till I get what I came for.

31:29.431 --> 31:32.100
Oh. And what are you going to do?

31:34.353 --> 31:36.647
Well... I was thinkin' about shootin' ya.

31:39.191 --> 31:42.444
Jack... what are you doing?

31:42.945 --> 31:45.614
Gettin' a little dirty for you, Maybourne?

31:54.122 --> 31:56.416
Bringing the gate room on line.

31:59.253 --> 32:01.922
The iris is holding,
but it's starting to heat up.

32:02.005 --> 32:04.883
- How long before it loses integrity?
- I'm not sure.

32:04.967 --> 32:08.720
We may have turned that planet
into a giant ball of superheated plasma.

32:08.846 --> 32:11.640
It could power the gate for months.

32:11.723 --> 32:15.227
- We have to autodestruct.
- The other gate survived the explosion.

32:15.352 --> 32:19.106
- Would not ours as well?
- At least it would be buried under rock.

32:19.231 --> 32:21.775
(Carter) It wouldn't stop
pumping out radiation.

32:21.900 --> 32:26.280
- Eventually the heat will melt the iris.
- Then what do we do, Major?

32:27.656 --> 32:31.785
There is a chance that the gate
will shut down on its own.

32:31.869 --> 32:34.705
- The 38-minute window.
- There's no way to know for sure.

32:34.788 --> 32:37.708
These are untested circumstances.

32:38.834 --> 32:41.670
How long has the gate been open?

32:43.422 --> 32:45.382
Coming up on 21 minutes.

32:50.888 --> 32:53.348
Colonel, have you
taken leave of your senses?

32:53.473 --> 32:55.601
I'm with Maybourne. What does that say?

32:55.684 --> 32:58.228
How dare you come into my house,
waving a gun?

32:58.312 --> 33:01.190
Not waving - pointing. Sit down.

33:05.986 --> 33:09.573
I hope you realise you're making
the biggest mistake of your life.

33:09.698 --> 33:12.951
When this is over, I promise
you'll regret the day we ever met.

33:13.076 --> 33:15.287
That day's come and gone, Senator.

33:15.412 --> 33:18.916
If you don't care about your own career,
think about your friends.

33:18.999 --> 33:21.210
- What does that mean?
- You mess with me,...

33:21.335 --> 33:24.588
..and Dr Jackson will be
out of the SGC permanently...

33:24.713 --> 33:30.219
..and Major Carter will be cleaning toilets
in an air-force weather station in Alaska.

33:30.302 --> 33:32.596
And as for the alien, Teal'c...

33:32.721 --> 33:36.558
Let's just say I know some bioengineers
in the Department of Defense...

33:36.683 --> 33:39.478
..who'd love to get their hands
on his symbiote.

33:39.561 --> 33:42.022
OK, I'm in. I need the password.

33:45.734 --> 33:49.488
I'll give you a choice:
white meat, or dark meat?

33:49.780 --> 33:52.783
- You wouldn't dare.
- It's usually something familiar,...

33:52.866 --> 33:55.536
..like a wife's maiden name.

33:56.620 --> 33:59.790
I have a wife, three children,
seven grandchildren...

33:59.915 --> 34:03.001
..and various nieces and nephews.

34:03.126 --> 34:05.170
Good luck.

34:14.304 --> 34:16.348
Try "Oscar".

34:21.103 --> 34:23.063
(Maybourne) That's it. We're in.

34:24.356 --> 34:26.149
I'm downloading now.

34:27.818 --> 34:34.324
Kinsey's on-line activities connect him to
NID actions over the last year and a half,...

34:34.699 --> 34:38.370
..including the secret operation
I ran out of Area 51 ,...

34:38.495 --> 34:41.581
..the involvement with the Russians...

34:43.292 --> 34:45.252
..and the threats to Hammond.

34:45.377 --> 34:47.670
(O'Neill) You're a piece of work, Kinsey.

34:47.754 --> 34:49.882
You try to shut down the SGC.

34:50.757 --> 34:54.094
You make a speech about how
you hate secret organisations,...

34:54.178 --> 34:58.807
- ..then jump in bed with the NID.
- I still think the gate's a Pandora's box.

34:58.891 --> 35:04.313
It should be buried for ever. But as long
as it's open and is a threat to this planet,...

35:04.396 --> 35:07.566
..then I'm gonna make sure
it's used the way it should be used:

35:07.691 --> 35:09.651
..to defend God's creation.

35:09.776 --> 35:13.530
Blow the rhetoric
up somebody else's nose.

35:13.614 --> 35:19.077
- You're just a power-hungry hypocrite.
- The only currency in this town is power.

35:19.161 --> 35:24.291
So if I have to shake hands with the devil
in order to do the Lord's work,...

35:24.416 --> 35:27.586
- ..then so be it.
- You self-righteous son of a bitch.

35:27.711 --> 35:31.548
- Where do you get off...?
- Judge not lest ye be judged!

35:31.673 --> 35:34.134
I read the mission reports
from that mountain.

35:34.218 --> 35:37.221
You play with the fate
of this planet on a daily basis.

35:37.346 --> 35:40.349
I'm doing the job I was asked to do.

35:40.432 --> 35:44.728
I doubt very much your constituents
could say the same about you.

35:44.853 --> 35:49.816
Please! Given the chance, half of all
American citizens won't even vote.

35:49.942 --> 35:53.445
And the half that do vote are
too stupid to know what they're doing.

35:53.570 --> 35:56.240
Which explains how you got elected.

35:56.323 --> 36:01.954
In order to expose me, you're gonna have
to compromise the secrecy of the SGC.

36:02.037 --> 36:04.081
Are you really willing to do that?

36:05.582 --> 36:07.209
(Maybourne) I'm done.

36:12.589 --> 36:14.633
Give it up.

36:15.342 --> 36:19.721
What are you going to do?
Take down the whole NID?

36:20.180 --> 36:22.057
Nope.

36:22.808 --> 36:24.852
Here's the deal.

36:26.144 --> 36:29.815
Get them to reinstate Hammond,
or this disk goes to the press.

36:29.940 --> 36:32.067
It'll never see the light of day.

36:32.150 --> 36:37.990
I don't think you'll see the light of day if
your friends find out you're the weak link.

36:40.325 --> 36:43.662
You learned to play hardball pretty fast,
didn't you, Colonel?

36:43.745 --> 36:46.039
I had a good teacher.

36:46.165 --> 36:48.208
Trouble, Jack.

37:05.893 --> 37:07.853
Approaching 38 minutes.

37:18.614 --> 37:20.991
Who made the call? Your wife?

37:22.659 --> 37:27.873
Give me the disk...
and you might just get outta here alive.

37:28.957 --> 37:32.044
They won't come in here
with the group he's got downstairs.

37:32.127 --> 37:34.421
But we've still gotta get out.

37:56.151 --> 37:58.445
- It's still open?
- Yes, sir.

38:03.867 --> 38:06.578
Well, there's no point staying here.

38:07.371 --> 38:09.915
I'll inform the president from the surface.

38:11.834 --> 38:15.337
Yes, sir. I'm sure it'll be
much safer up there(!)

38:26.515 --> 38:28.559
(Teal'c) Major Carter!

38:41.280 --> 38:44.366
- What happened?
- The gate shut itself off.

38:45.659 --> 38:48.120
- Are you sure?
- It's over.

38:55.711 --> 38:58.005
For what it's worth, Major,...

38:59.590 --> 39:00.966
..l'm sorry.

39:18.984 --> 39:21.445
Great party, Mrs K. Thank you.

39:32.873 --> 39:35.417
Senator Kinsey! Senator Kinsey!

39:36.210 --> 39:40.380
We've heard you are planning
to run for the White House.

39:40.464 --> 39:43.634
- The White House?!
- Are you declaring your candidacy?

39:46.553 --> 39:50.933
Diane, this is really not
how I intended this to come out.

39:51.058 --> 39:53.352
So it's true, then, Senator?

39:54.019 --> 39:56.939
Well... now that you're all here...

39:58.232 --> 40:00.776
We've often talked about my goals.

40:01.318 --> 40:06.031
Do I think I would make a good president?
You're damn right I would.

40:06.156 --> 40:10.244
You know how I feel about things.
You know how hard I've worked.

40:10.327 --> 40:14.164
The potential I see
in the people of this great nation...

40:14.248 --> 40:17.668
..and the way so many
of its leaders have let them down,...

40:17.793 --> 40:20.879
..it's enough to bring tears to your eyes.

40:21.004 --> 40:25.968
The solutions to the problems
faced by our government are so simple.

40:27.761 --> 40:29.805
Listen to the people.

40:55.164 --> 40:57.457
- Jack, come in.
- General.

40:58.792 --> 41:01.253
- It's good to have you back.
- Thank you.

41:01.378 --> 41:04.548
I hear I missed quite a bit
of excitement while I was gone.

41:04.673 --> 41:09.136
- You'll have to ask Carter about that, sir.
- I'm looking forward to the debriefing.

41:09.219 --> 41:10.929
As am l.

41:11.722 --> 41:15.392
Jack... what do I owe you for this?

41:16.894 --> 41:20.480
Continued latitude,
patience and understanding.

41:20.606 --> 41:23.275
So... just be yourself, sir.

41:24.610 --> 41:26.653
(phone rings)

41:27.237 --> 41:28.864
Hammond.

41:30.574 --> 41:32.701
It's for you.

41:36.663 --> 41:39.041
- Hello?
- Hello, Jack.

41:39.791 --> 41:41.668
Maybourne.

41:42.628 --> 41:46.298
- Where are you?
- I'm not in jail, if that's what you think.

41:46.381 --> 41:48.342
(nuta steel band)

41:49.760 --> 41:54.723
I e-mailed myself a copy of the evidence
when I saved it to disk for ya.

41:56.183 --> 41:57.017
I know.

41:57.100 --> 41:59.811
Kinsey got me transferred
to a nicer facility...

41:59.895 --> 42:02.272
..while I await my execution.

42:02.356 --> 42:04.566
It made things simple after that.

42:04.650 --> 42:07.319
Why didn't you try to escape
when you were with me?

42:07.402 --> 42:08.737
Come on, Jack.

42:09.780 --> 42:13.116
You trusted me. I didn't want you
to look bad for the president.

42:13.242 --> 42:16.745
Besides, you're too good
to have let it happen.

42:17.621 --> 42:22.167
- So what are you gonna do now?
- Short term, I'll have a few margaritas.

42:22.251 --> 42:26.463
- And after that, who knows?
- Yeah, right.

42:26.839 --> 42:29.132
Thanks for all your help.

42:34.471 --> 42:37.891
General... about what you owe me?

42:38.600 --> 42:40.894
Anything I can do.

42:40.978 --> 42:43.939
Well, nothing right now, but...

42:44.022 --> 42:46.316
..one day I may ask you to...

42:47.484 --> 42:49.695
..buy back my soul.
