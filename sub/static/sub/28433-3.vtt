Roger?
Did you get glasses?

00:06.540 --> 00:08.242
Not glasses,
Francine.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.777
Transitions.

00:09.877 --> 00:11.379
(guitar riff plays)

00:11.479 --> 00:13.013
Best product
I've ever owned.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.748
Now I don't have to switch out
my regular glasses

00:14.848 --> 00:16.950
for sunglasses
every time I go outside.

00:17.051 --> 00:19.420
But you didn't wear
glasses before.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.256
But now I don't have
to switch 'em out!

00:22.356 --> 00:24.592
Ugh! Eyes hurt like
a bitch, though.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.533
Barry invited me
to go with his family

00:32.633 --> 00:34.235
on a trip next month
to see the world's

00:34.335 --> 00:36.070
largest
chest of drawers.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.771
And I'd very much
like to go.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.073
I don't know.

00:39.173 --> 00:41.109
We've never
met Barry's parents.

00:41.209 --> 00:44.112
But judging from Barry, I think
it's safe to assume they're --

00:44.212 --> 00:46.647
and this is nothing against
Barry, we love Barry --

00:46.747 --> 00:49.117
monstrously stupid
sewer-people.

00:49.217 --> 00:51.051
Agreed.
Answer is a hard no.

00:51.152 --> 00:54.555
Another brilliant decision
by my genius parents.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.090
Sass-back.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.426
In my very own home.
That's it!

00:58.526 --> 01:00.994
Not only are you not
going on that trip, Smartmouth,

01:01.095 --> 01:02.430
you're grounded
for two weeks!

01:02.530 --> 01:04.064
You're so unfair!

01:04.165 --> 01:05.599
You never let me
do anything!

01:05.699 --> 01:06.767
I'm so frustrated,
I...

01:06.867 --> 01:07.935

01:08.035 --> 01:10.604

01:10.704 --> 01:12.473
Don't you do it,
young man.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.608
I think I'm gonna
go bananas!

01:14.708 --> 01:16.610
-Do not go bananas...
-It's gonna happen!

01:16.710 --> 01:18.779
-You best not go bananas, boy!
-I'm gonna go bananas!

01:18.879 --> 01:20.281
Do it, Steve.
Go bananas.

they'll be

02:37.425 --> 02:38.826
on the look-out
for me this time.

No, if our parents
became friends,

yours are so chill,
maybe they'd rub off on mine.

02:44.798 --> 02:46.500

go on a rampage!

02:57.445 --> 03:00.448
Everybody, the eclipse
is about to start!

03:00.548 --> 03:03.050
Everybody, take a pair
of special glasses

03:03.150 --> 03:04.852
from my giant tub of glasses.

will do me just fine,
thank you very much.

Roger, you could really
damage your eyes

looking at the eclipse
with just your glasses.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.730
Uh, they're not just glasses,
Klaus, they're...

03:39.853 --> 03:41.322
I do not blame
the glasses, though.

Good product.

talked us into going to dinner

Hey, I don't wanna
do this, either.

on swamp stew

finally actually meet

Oh, it's just vodka with
some orange juice

Mr. Robinson played

04:52.626 --> 04:53.961

09:10.517 --> 09:12.886
I'm expecting a text
from my friend McDaniel.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.255

-Which character was that?

09:15.355 --> 09:17.224
-That wasn't from the --
-Is it from McDaniel?

09:17.324 --> 09:18.726
I'm fighting with McDaniel
right now.

09:18.826 --> 09:20.994
So, if it's from McDaniel,
do not write back.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.563
-It's from Rafi.
-Uch, I'm fighting with Rafi.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.065
He sucks so hard.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.433
Here, I'm gonna dictate
a message to you...

why don'tcha?!

09:29.903 --> 09:32.906

That's it! I don't care

Of course!

hanging out again sometime.

11:06.466 --> 11:08.335
Absolutely not!

Now, you listen to me,

wasn't our thing.

you so much as try

down to the docks

16:25.318 --> 16:26.586

the crime is.

As you may remember,
a few months,

17:44.897 --> 17:48.568
but what seems
like years ago,

17:48.668 --> 17:50.837
your father convinced me
to stop taking

17:50.937 --> 17:53.240
what he thought
were mere vitamins,

17:53.340 --> 17:56.343
but were, in fact,
an anti-psychotic medication.

17:56.443 --> 17:57.510
STEVE: Yeah,
of course I rem--

17:57.610 --> 17:59.946
Without them,
I was no longer dumb,

18:00.046 --> 18:05.618
but rather,
a diabolically evil genius!

18:05.718 --> 18:07.086
Yes. I remember.
But --

18:07.187 --> 18:09.021
Meanwhile,
Hayley became upset

18:09.122 --> 18:10.323
when she discovered
the funds

18:10.457 --> 18:13.526
from her Eskimo Studies program
were going to a fraternity --

18:13.626 --> 18:15.094
STEVE: Wait, what?

18:15.195 --> 18:17.430
I don't think we were even
aware of those events...

18:17.530 --> 18:18.798
Silence!

18:18.898 --> 18:22.034
Anyway, when you took me
on this trip in such haste,

18:22.135 --> 18:25.872
you once again deprived me
of my medication,

18:25.972 --> 18:30.210
and sealed your
parents' marriage's doom!

18:30.310 --> 18:33.880
My plan is already
under way.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.515
That was the bellboy.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.384
Says we both need
to come pick up a bag

18:37.484 --> 18:38.551
in the steam room.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.553
Steam room?
That seems odd.

18:40.653 --> 18:43.356
Even odder?
Our bags are all right here.

18:43.456 --> 18:44.857
But hey, free bag.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.228
Cowboys and Indians,
huh?

18:48.328 --> 18:49.529
(Southern accent)
The bellboy said --

18:49.629 --> 18:50.730
(British accent)
No, that's not it.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.232
(deep voice)
The bellboy --

18:52.332 --> 18:53.466
(British accent)
Damn, I've lost it.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.134
(high-pitched voice)
The -- The bellboy said --

18:55.235 --> 18:56.303
Yes, there it is.

18:56.403 --> 18:59.839
The bellboy said you both need
to pick up a bag

18:59.939 --> 19:01.541
in the steam room.

19:01.641 --> 19:02.742
Oh, okay.

19:02.842 --> 19:05.878
Thanks for
the message, hun.

19:05.978 --> 19:10.082
(British accent) Now your
worst fear will come true!

19:10.183 --> 19:12.419
(laughs)

19:12.519 --> 19:14.053
This is the same guy
that bit my finger

19:14.153 --> 19:16.022
'cause I was holding
a piece of cake.

19:19.492 --> 19:20.527
Hello?

19:20.627 --> 19:22.395
Stan-o? Franny?

19:22.495 --> 19:24.364
Luggage doesn't seem
to be here yet.

19:24.464 --> 19:26.699
Might as well grab
some pine, get slick.

19:26.799 --> 19:30.036
BARRY: In that steam
is a chemical aphrodisiac

19:30.136 --> 19:31.070
that makes humans

19:31.170 --> 19:33.540
1,000 times hornier

19:33.640 --> 19:36.243
than is naturally possible.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.711
No matter their agreement
not to swing before,

19:38.811 --> 19:42.382
they won't be able
to resist doing it now!

19:42.482 --> 19:44.617
Don't you want to see
your parents punished,

19:44.717 --> 19:45.885
young Steven?

19:45.985 --> 19:48.555
For not letting you
do what you wanted?

19:48.655 --> 19:51.691
But they only ever did that
because they worry about me.

19:51.791 --> 19:54.294
And now you're gonna
mess up my family?

19:54.394 --> 19:56.429
That's makin' me mad,
Barry,

19:56.529 --> 19:58.865
gettin' me
real frustrated...

19:58.965 --> 20:01.601
Don't you do it, Steven.
Don't you go bananas.

20:01.701 --> 20:02.802
Oh, it's happening...

20:02.902 --> 20:04.637
-Don't you dare.
-No stopping it now...

20:04.737 --> 20:06.973
-You best not go bananas.
-Here I go!

20:07.073 --> 20:09.742
(shouting, screaming)

20:09.842 --> 20:16.082
♪♪

20:16.182 --> 20:18.318
(slow-motion screaming)

20:18.418 --> 20:25.124
♪♪

20:27.727 --> 20:29.562
Mom and Dad!

20:31.264 --> 20:34.166
(steam hisses)

20:34.267 --> 20:36.936
Oh, no!
I'm too late!

20:37.036 --> 20:38.505
You all had sex!

20:38.605 --> 20:41.140
Yes, but only with
our respective partners.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.109
We hung up a towel
as a barrier.

20:43.209 --> 20:45.578
Although we did fist-bump each
other through it quite a bit.

20:45.678 --> 20:49.015
We told you we could maintain
boundaries for ourselves.

20:49.115 --> 20:51.784
Oh.
That's a relief.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.353
This whole scene here
is still really gross to me.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.622
I'll see you guys in the car.

20:55.722 --> 20:58.591
You guys know what my favorite
part of having sex is?

20:58.691 --> 21:02.128
That end part.
That crazy feeling.

21:02.228 --> 21:04.130
Bye!
Have a great time!
