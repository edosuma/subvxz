Kids, breakfast!

00:04.755 --> 00:08.048
Kids? [Sighs]
Phil, would you get them?
[Video Game Sounds]

00:08.132 --> 00:10.510
Yeah. Just a sec.

00:10.594 --> 00:12.887
Kids!

00:13.931 --> 00:15.431
That is-
Okay.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.893
Kids? Get down here!

00:18.977 --> 00:22.063
Why are you guys yelling at us
when we're way upstairs?

00:22.189 --> 00:24.524
Just text me.
All right.
That's not gonna happen.

00:24.608 --> 00:26.567
And, wow! You're not
wearing that outfit.

00:26.694 --> 00:29.153
What's wrong with it?
Honey, do you have anything
to say to your daughter...

00:29.279 --> 00:31.823
about her skirt?
Sorry.

00:31.907 --> 00:34.617
- Oh, yeah. That looks
really cute, sweetheart.
- Thanks.

00:34.743 --> 00:38.413
No. It's way too short.
People know you're a girl.
You don't need to prove it to them.

00:38.497 --> 00:40.832
Luke got his head stuck
in the banister again.

00:40.916 --> 00:43.042
I got it.
Where's the baby oil?

00:43.127 --> 00:46.671
It's on our bedside tab-
I don't know. Find it.

00:48.757 --> 00:49.716
Come on!

00:49.800 --> 00:52.802
I was out of control
growing up.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.804
There, you know? I said it.

00:54.888 --> 00:57.557
I-I just don't want my kids...

00:57.641 --> 00:59.350
to make the same bad mistakes
I made.

I-If Haley never wakes up on
a beach in Florida, half-naked,

Where's the penalty?

We're very different.

Jay's from the city.

01:29.965 --> 01:32.467
He has a big business.

01:32.551 --> 01:34.761
I come from a small village.

very beautiful.

01:55.866 --> 01:58.409
Come on, Coach.
You gotta take that kid out.

01:58.494 --> 02:01.204
You wanna take him out?
How about I take you out?

02:01.288 --> 02:04.540
- Honey, honey.
- Why don't you
worry about your son?

02:04.625 --> 02:07.543

Yeah.
No, no. That's funny.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.185

We just adopted her
from Vietnam.

And we're bringing her home
for the first time, huh?

02:47.417 --> 02:50.211
She's an angel.
You and your wife
must be thrilled.

So, what are we talking about?

03:03.016 --> 03:05.101
guh, five-
five years now?

03:05.185 --> 03:08.145
And, uh, we just-
we decided we really
wanted to have a baby.

03:08.230 --> 03:12.024
So, we had initially asked
one of our lesbian friends
to be a surrogate, but-

03:12.109 --> 03:14.193
Then we figured,
they're already mean enough.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.112

one of 'em pregnant?
Pregnant, no.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.864

stuck with these people

You're right, you're right.
Okay. I'm sorry.

- Look at that baby
with those cream puffs.
- Okay. Excuse me.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.509
Excuse me.

03:38.594 --> 03:41.596

in a crowded orphanage if it
wasn't for us "cream puffs."

09:45.377 --> 09:47.544
You'd tell 'em. They'd say
something judgmental.

09:47.671 --> 09:49.338
Exactly.
You'd get mad.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.840
I know. And then something that's
supposed to be nothing but joyful...

09:51.925 --> 09:53.550
suddenly turns into this huge fight.

09:53.677 --> 09:56.804
And who wants a big,
emotional scene like that?
Thank you. Thank you.

09:56.888 --> 09:59.098
I'm so-
I'm so relieved you understand.

09:59.182 --> 10:01.433
I invited them over
for dinner tonight.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.603
What?
I had to.

10:04.688 --> 10:06.981
This would have gone on forever.
You're an avoider.

10:07.065 --> 10:09.650
No. No. No.
Cam, I'm calling them
right now and canceling.

10:09.734 --> 10:13.404
No, you're not.
You're telling your family
you adopted a baby, tonight.

10:13.488 --> 10:16.657
And you do have
avoidance issues.
Even Longinus said so.

10:16.741 --> 10:19.451
Are- Are you really
not hearing these names?

10:21.955 --> 10:24.498
[Doorbell Rings]
[Haley] Don't answer it!
I'll get it!

10:31.881 --> 10:34.258
Hi.
Hey, you must be Dylan.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.969
Hey.
Dylan. Yeah.
I'm Haley's mother.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.137
Hey.
Mm-hmm.

10:38.263 --> 10:40.472
Come on. Let's go.
[Clears Throat]
Okay. Um-

10:40.557 --> 10:42.933
Hang on one second.
Um- Whoa.

10:43.018 --> 10:46.437
Dylan, you're still
in high school?

10:46.563 --> 10:48.939
Yeah, I'm a senior.
A senior.
Okay. Cool.

10:49.024 --> 10:53.944
Hey, Phil. Sweetie. Honey.
He is Dylan, and he is a senior.

10:54.029 --> 10:56.780
[Whispers]
You have to scare him.

10:56.865 --> 10:59.616
Let me meet this "playa."

10:59.701 --> 11:01.702
Phil Dunphy, yo.

11:06.041 --> 11:08.250
It's like that. You just-
You just stare down at 'em,

11:08.335 --> 11:10.502
let the eyes do the work.

11:10.587 --> 11:12.504
Your mouth might be saying,
"Hey, we cool,"

11:12.589 --> 11:14.548
but your eyes are like,
"No, we not."

11:14.632 --> 11:17.426
"Nice to meet you."
"No, it's not."

11:18.553 --> 11:20.179
"It's all good."

11:20.263 --> 11:22.348
[Mutters]

11:22.432 --> 11:23.599
Yo.
Yo.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.603
Okay, I see you two guys-
Wait, wait, wait.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.314
You two-

11:31.941 --> 11:34.860
You two keep it real,
know what I mean, son?

11:34.944 --> 11:36.653
Not really.

11:36.780 --> 11:38.739
Please, stop.
That's cool.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.492
Ow.
Oh, God! That's my back.
Oh, honey. Sweetheart.

11:41.576 --> 11:43.869
Ow! Oh!
I slipped in the baby oil.

11:43.953 --> 11:47.164
"Oh, where you from
originally?"

11:47.248 --> 11:50.751
"I could defeat you if it came to
a physical confrontation."

11:50.877 --> 11:53.587
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
I don't know about this.
Should I call a doctor?

11:53.671 --> 11:56.423
No, no, no, no, no.
Okay.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.717
You're very strong, homes.
Thanks.

11:58.843 --> 12:01.595
Okay. Nice-
Nice soft landing.
There you go.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.139
Okay.
I am on my side though.
Okay, let's go. Come on.

12:04.265 --> 12:06.892
So just flip me right back,
and we're good.
[Sighs]

12:06.976 --> 12:08.727
We'll be good.

12:08.812 --> 12:12.439
I just need to get
flipped right on my back,
and we should be fine. So-

12:16.778 --> 12:18.695
Brenda Feldman.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.908
What is that?
A poem I have written
for Brenda Feldman.

12:22.992 --> 12:27.746
- Of course it is.
- I put my thoughts into words
and now my words into action.

12:27.831 --> 12:30.290
Hey, I'll give you 50 bucks
not to do this.

12:30.375 --> 12:33.001
I'm 11 years old.
What am I gonna do
with money?

12:33.086 --> 12:35.212
What are you gonna do
with a 16-year-old?

12:35.338 --> 12:39.925
He's like a bullfighter.
Mmm.
You ever see a bullfight?

12:40.009 --> 12:42.886
- I can't watch this.
- You're in such a bad mood.

12:42.971 --> 12:46.432
And I know why.
It's because that man
thought you were my father.

12:46.516 --> 12:47.891
No.
Yes.

12:48.017 --> 12:51.228
No.
When you say "No" like that,
it's always "Yes."

12:51.312 --> 12:54.565
Come on. We're in the mall.
Let's get you, like,
some younger clothes.

12:54.691 --> 12:57.693
There's a store there.
I don't need
any younger clothes.

12:57.777 --> 13:01.196
And I don't care what
some jackass in a pair
of ripped jeans thinks about me.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.948
Good. You shouldn't.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.159
You should only care
what I think.

13:05.243 --> 13:07.911
I love you,
and I don't care
how old you are.

13:07.996 --> 13:11.290
So stop being a gloomy goose
and stop being so hard on Manny.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.292
The only reason
I'm hard on Manny...

13:13.376 --> 13:15.961
is just because
I don't wanna see him
make a fool of himself.

13:16.045 --> 13:19.047
And I can smell that
hair goo of his from here.

13:19.132 --> 13:22.092
Look, I don't know what's gonna
happen to him over there.

13:22.177 --> 13:25.888
But you're his family now,
and that means only one thing-

13:25.972 --> 13:30.476
You be the wind in his back,
not the spit in his face.

13:30.602 --> 13:33.437
What?
It's something
my mom always says.

13:33.521 --> 13:36.773
It's gorgeous in Spanish.
Look, he's there.

13:41.446 --> 13:45.616
She has a boyfriend.
Oh, I'm sorry,
mi niño.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.618
I gave her my heart,

13:47.702 --> 13:50.954
she gave me a picture of me
as an old-time sheriff.

13:51.039 --> 13:52.456
Oh.

13:52.582 --> 13:55.792
That was pretty stupid of me,
wasn't it?
No, mi amor.

13:55.877 --> 13:58.212
It was brave.
Right, Jay? Brave.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.381
W-Well, you'll know better
next time.

14:01.466 --> 14:03.425
Come on.
Let's get a pretzel.

14:05.929 --> 14:07.971
Mentira.
A mí sí me gusta.

14:11.184 --> 14:14.728
Uh, excuse me, sir.
We ask that all mall-walkers
stay to the right.

14:28.618 --> 14:31.411
[Haley]
Alex, get out! Mom!

14:31.496 --> 14:33.413
Alex, leave your sister alone.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.207
I was just getting my book.
Gosh.

14:35.291 --> 14:38.877
I know, sweetie.
But you need to respect
their privacy.

14:39.003 --> 14:41.255
What are they
doing up there?
Nothing.

14:41.339 --> 14:44.716
Lying on her bed,
watching a movie.

14:44.801 --> 14:47.302
Okay. Okay.

14:47.387 --> 14:51.640
Um, I'm making a cake
for tonight. You wanna
help me with the frosting?

14:51.724 --> 14:53.475
Sure.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.603
So, you know,
if Haley got pregnant,

14:56.688 --> 14:58.897
would you ever pretend
she has mono for a few months,

14:58.982 --> 15:01.692
and then, like, tell everyone
the baby's yours?

15:01.818 --> 15:04.945
What?
This senior at school was
"out sick" for four months,

15:05.029 --> 15:08.865
but Jenna Resnick swears
she saw her breast-feeding
at a coin-op car wash.

15:10.326 --> 15:13.036
[Sighs]

15:14.581 --> 15:16.832
Buddy, what are you wearing?

15:16.916 --> 15:19.835
- Nothing.
- Uh-uh. No jacket.

15:19.919 --> 15:23.630
One hat.
How many pairs of underwear
do you have on?

15:23.715 --> 15:27.467
One.
[Sighs]
Six.

15:27.552 --> 15:30.429
First of all,
it would be really cool
to see Haley that fat.

15:30.513 --> 15:34.099
And how awesome would it be
to have a fake little brother
who's really my nephew.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.852
Haley is not getting pregnant.
[Clears Throat]

15:36.978 --> 15:38.895
Just saying "if."
I know.

15:38.980 --> 15:42.691
And I know you like to make
trouble for your sister, but
it's not gonna work this time.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.652
You know why?
'Cause your sister's a good girl.

15:45.737 --> 15:49.740
I know. I was just
like her when I was-

15:49.824 --> 15:52.492
I want you to know,
I'm not enjoying this.

15:52.577 --> 15:54.995
But this is an important lesson
that you're learning.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.623
So, soak it.
Keep it.

15:57.707 --> 16:00.125
[Clearing Throat]

16:00.209 --> 16:02.294
You're too close.
It's gonna hurt.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.087
It's supposed to hurt.

16:04.172 --> 16:07.591
- And why are you smiling?
- I'm- What?

16:19.354 --> 16:21.980
Oh, forget it.
I can't do this.

16:22.065 --> 16:24.274
The point is you're scared.
I think you've learned
your lesson.

16:24.359 --> 16:25.317
[Shoots]
Wow.

16:25.401 --> 16:26.026
Ow!

16:27.737 --> 16:30.113
Mom!
What are you doing?

16:30.198 --> 16:32.866
Oh, hey! I was just, um,
dropping off some laundry.

16:32.950 --> 16:34.910
- Is this a bad time?
- Yeah.

16:34.994 --> 16:38.246
Oh. Okay.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.915
Uh, can you
shut the door, please?

16:39.999 --> 16:43.001
Actually, we're just gonna
go ahead and leave that open.

16:43.086 --> 16:44.294
Why?

16:44.379 --> 16:47.381
Because I have, uh,
seen this little show before-

16:47.465 --> 16:50.050
lying on the bed
with a tall senior.

16:50.134 --> 16:52.052
One minute you're just friends,
watching Falcon Crest,

16:52.136 --> 16:54.971
and the next you're lying
underneath the air hockey table
with your bra in your pocket.

16:55.056 --> 16:56.473
Whoa.
Mom!

16:56.557 --> 16:59.393
- [Whimpering]
You hit my bone!
- It was an accident!

16:59.477 --> 17:02.979
- I thought you were my friend!
- I am your friend.

17:03.064 --> 17:05.190
Dad! Dad, Dad.
You have got to talk to Mom.

17:05.273 --> 17:08.068
She is, like,
completely freaking out
and embarrassing me!

17:08.152 --> 17:09.986
Honey, your mom isn't always
as cool about things as-

17:10.070 --> 17:11.029
- [Shoots]
- Ow!

17:11.114 --> 17:12.614
What is with this thing?

17:12.699 --> 17:14.281
[Shoots]
Ow!

17:16.452 --> 17:21.832
My dad. Uh, my dad still isn't
completely comfortable with this.

17:21.915 --> 17:24.626
Um- He-He still does this thing.
It's been five years now.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.170
And he still does this thing
where he announces himself...

17:27.255 --> 17:29.214
before walking into
any room we're in...

17:29.298 --> 17:32.884
just to make sure he doesn't
have to ever see us kiss.

17:32.969 --> 17:35.095
Wish my mother
had that system.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.472
Remember?
Not now.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.725
I still can't believe
you did this to me.

17:39.809 --> 17:43.687
Would you get
in the spirit of things?
It's a celebration.

17:43.771 --> 17:46.648
[Doorbell Rings]

17:46.733 --> 17:49.860
- Oh, God.
- Okay, I'm gonna go get Lily ready.

17:49.986 --> 17:52.946
Okay.
And I want you to just
come straight out with it.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.698
All right.
Okay. You can do this.

17:54.824 --> 17:56.032
Yeah.

17:56.159 --> 17:57.284
No.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.745

All right. Go.
Do it. Go.

17:59.829 --> 18:01.788

Hi, guys.
Hey.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.550
That looks good.
Oh, thank you. Thanks.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.594
Don't thank us. Open it.
Dad is coming right behind.

18:15.678 --> 18:17.304
[Doorbell Ringing]

18:17.388 --> 18:19.848
[Jay]
Knock, knock! We're here.
Coming in!

18:19.932 --> 18:22.768
Don't worry, Dad.
Nothing gay going on here.

18:22.852 --> 18:25.437
May I take your multicolored
coat and bejeweled cap?

18:25.521 --> 18:27.898
Yeah. Yeah.
Hey, Jay.

Hi, Dad.
Hi, Gloria. How are you?

18:33.696 --> 18:36.615
Oh, what a beautiful dress.
Ay, thank you, Phil.

18:36.741 --> 18:40.076
Okay.
Oh, hey-
Phil.

18:40.203 --> 18:42.746
That's how she says "Phil."
Not "feel." Phil.
Oh.

18:42.830 --> 18:45.373
- So how was your trip?
- It was good.
It was good actually.

18:45.458 --> 18:49.628
But, um, about that, I-
I have something
that I need to tell you guys.

18:49.712 --> 18:52.005
Um- Uh, we didn't
just go to Vietnam
for pleasure.

18:52.089 --> 18:54.466
We, uh, kind of have
some big news.

18:54.550 --> 18:57.344
Oh, God.
If Cam comes out here
with boobs, I'm leaving.

18:57.428 --> 18:59.971
- [Claire] Dad.
- I hope he didn't
embarrass you, Mom.

19:00.056 --> 19:03.350
Oh, don't mind her.
Haley had her first
boy over today...

19:03.434 --> 19:05.393
and Phil shot him.

19:06.562 --> 19:09.314
Anyway, um, so, about-
about a year ago,

19:09.398 --> 19:11.483
Cam and I started feeling
this longing, you know,

19:11.567 --> 19:14.361
for something more,
like, uh, maybe a baby?

19:14.445 --> 19:16.905
- Ooh, that's a bad idea.
- What do you mean, "bad idea"?

19:16.989 --> 19:20.617
Well, kids need a mother.
I mean if you two guys
are bored, get a dog.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.869
Okay, we're not bored, Dad.

19:22.954 --> 19:25.247
I support you, Mitchell,
even though you're not my son.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.666
I-I-I-I think what Dad
is trying to say...

19:27.750 --> 19:30.836
is that, Mitchell,
you're a little uptight.

19:30.920 --> 19:34.172
- Kids bring chaos, and-
and you don't handle it well.
- That's not what Dad's saying.

19:34.257 --> 19:37.342
That's what you're saying.
And it's insulting
in a whole different way.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.970
Okay, people.
Let's all "chillax."

19:40.096 --> 19:42.848

Thank you. Thank you.

notices he's not here.

Oh, so that's
the big announcement, huh?
You two broke up.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.606
Well- Well, a baby
wasn't gonna help that anyway.

19:51.691 --> 19:55.443
And let me tell you.
You're better off, because
he was a bit of a drama queen.

20:21.137 --> 20:22.554
Her name is Lily.
Oh.

20:22.680 --> 20:25.515
Exciting!
Just turn it off.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.851
I can't turn it off.
It's who I am.

20:27.977 --> 20:29.978
The music.
Oh, yes, the music.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.730
♪♪ [Stops]
Come say hi to Lily.

20:31.856 --> 20:35.650
Ay, miren a la princesita.
The little princess.
[Haley] She's so cute!

20:35.776 --> 20:37.652
So cute.
Thank you.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.739
[Claire]
Let me see her. Let me see her.
Let me see her.

20:40.823 --> 20:42.699
Hi there, Lily.

20:42.825 --> 20:45.619
"Lily." Isn't that gonna be
hard for her to say?
[Haley] So cute.

20:45.703 --> 20:48.246
Phil.
Excuse me.

20:48.331 --> 20:51.541
Okay, I-I-I know that I said
I thought this was a bad idea.

20:51.626 --> 20:56.171
But, uh, what do I know?

20:56.255 --> 20:58.757
I mean, it's not like
I wrote the book on fatherhood.

20:58.841 --> 21:02.427
Been trying all my life
to get it right.
I'm still screwing up.

21:02.511 --> 21:05.472
- Right, Manny?
- I wrote a song about it in the car.

21:05.556 --> 21:08.725
Of course you did. Uh-

21:08.809 --> 21:12.812
Anyway, I'm happy for you.
And, uh, you should know that, uh,

21:12.897 --> 21:15.649
I'm not here
to spit in your face,

21:15.733 --> 21:18.526
I'm here to...
blow at your back.

21:18.653 --> 21:20.737
I don't understand
what that means.
I don't-

21:20.821 --> 21:24.115
Well, it's- it's supposed to
sound better in Spanish.

21:24.200 --> 21:28.495
Voy a ser la brisa
en tu espalda, no quien
te escupa en la frente.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.872
Oh, that's beautiful.
That's really nice.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.750
And thank you too.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.794
Anyhow, Mitch, uh-

21:35.878 --> 21:38.463
- No, Dad, it's- it's-
- [Lily Crying]

21:38.589 --> 21:40.465
I got her.
I got her.
Oh, she's crying.

21:40.591 --> 21:42.050
She wants her grandpa!
She wants her daddy!

21:42.176 --> 21:44.260
Do you wanna meet Grandpa?
What? Are you kidding?

21:44.387 --> 21:48.306
She's one of us now.
Let me see the little pot sticker.
[Chuckling]

21:48.391 --> 21:51.810
Hey, you're a cutie,
aren't you?

21:51.936 --> 21:55.397
Ah. Look at this.

[Jay]
We're from different worlds,
yet we somehow fit together.

22:00.236 --> 22:02.654
Love is what binds us,

22:02.738 --> 22:05.699
through fair or stormy weather.

22:05.783 --> 22:08.326
I stand before you now
with only one agenda-

22:08.411 --> 22:11.079
"To let you know
my heart is yours,

22:11.163 --> 22:13.540
Feldman comma Brenda."

22:14.875 --> 22:17.460
I mean, seriously.

22:18.879 --> 22:22.132
Luke, so far,
hasn't beaten me
in basketball.

22:22.216 --> 22:24.426
It's 2-0. 2-0.
Okay. Okay.

22:24.510 --> 22:26.678
[Grunting]

22:26.804 --> 22:29.931
Get that weak stuff
out of my kitchen!
Dad, stop it!

22:30.016 --> 22:32.058
Can you do me a favor?
Just grab-

22:32.143 --> 22:34.602
Ooh! How's the weather
down there?

22:34.687 --> 22:37.105
But when the day comes
that he does win-

22:37.189 --> 22:39.107
if- you know- if/when-

22:39.191 --> 22:41.359
he beats me,
I'm just gonna be like,

22:41.444 --> 22:43.403
"Well done. Well done."

22:43.487 --> 22:45.780
Just, like, let him-
Just support him...

22:45.865 --> 22:47.782
in- in- in that kind of stuff.

22:47.867 --> 22:51.953
I mean, I'd probably want to go,
like, two out of three and just
see what happens there, but-
