02:27.030 --> 02:28.531
How's your mom, ton'?

02:28.531 --> 02:30.033
The same.

02:30.033 --> 02:31.534
But my ex- goomar's cousin,

02:31.534 --> 02:33.503
i got her coming in
to take care of her.

02:33.503 --> 02:37.006
Russian girl.

02:37.006 --> 02:39.008
Who was it telling me
about the bevilaqua kid?

02:39.509 --> 02:41.511
You know that family has
money from construction?

02:41.511 --> 02:43.012
That fucking matthew...

02:43.012 --> 02:44.514
was never any good.

02:44.514 --> 02:46.516
He sure cried li
ke a baby that night.

02:46.516 --> 02:50.019
I think the family was
relieved he got taken out.

02:50.019 --> 02:52.021
What are you
gonna eat?

02:52.021 --> 02:54.023
Hey, waiter!

02:56.025 --> 02:58.027
That's the closest
cw- 16 ever got tony

02:58.027 --> 03:01.030
to discussing
the bevilaqua
murder on tape?

03:01.030 --> 03:03.032
I think at this point
it's time to consider

03:03.032 --> 03:05.034
16 bonpensiero compost.

03:06.536 --> 03:08.037
Bonpensiero...

03:08.037 --> 03:11.541
was crucial to
the webistics
stock fraud case.

03:11.541 --> 03:13.543
So, rico- wise.

03:15.545 --> 03:17.046
The airline tickets.

03:17.046 --> 03:18.548
Mail and wire fraud.

03:18.548 --> 03:20.049
Especially if
the mother testifies

03:20.550 --> 03:22.051
in exchange for immunity.

03:22.051 --> 03:24.554
C'mon, whose
own mother's gonna
testify against him?

03:24.554 --> 03:26.556
I say focus on
his garbage business.

03:28.057 --> 03:29.058
Extortion,

03:29.058 --> 03:30.560
interstate trucking.

03:30.560 --> 03:33.062
It's also the most
likely to yield
a prosecutable murder.

03:33.563 --> 03:35.064
Richie aprile,
exactly.

03:35.565 --> 03:38.067
No doubt about
it the cartel
had him whacked.

03:38.067 --> 03:40.570
Okay, garbage, but tony
shows real due diligence

03:40.570 --> 03:42.572
when it comes to
electronic debugging.

03:42.572 --> 03:44.073
What about
the home?

03:44.574 --> 03:46.576
Bonpensiero told me
him and tony talk
in the basement there

03:47.076 --> 03:48.077
on more than
one occasion.

03:48.077 --> 03:50.079
His own basement,
really?

03:50.079 --> 03:51.581
Where's the due
diligence there?

03:51.581 --> 03:54.083
Tony avoids talking business
in the house if he can.

03:54.083 --> 03:56.586
But if he has to, he'll take
somebody out by the pool.

03:56.586 --> 03:59.589
Except there he
fears parabolics.

03:59.589 --> 04:02.091
The basement
has these
noisy a. C. Ducts.

04:02.091 --> 04:04.594
He turns on the air
and he feels it's safe.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.549
"Surreptitiously
enter said premises

04:09.549 --> 04:11.050
and leave
without notice."

04:11.050 --> 04:12.552
This is a "sneak
'n peek" warrant.

04:12.552 --> 04:13.553
Correct,
your honor.

04:14.053 --> 04:15.555
I said you could enter
the basement to drop a wire.

04:15.555 --> 04:17.055
I mean, how many times
do we have to impact

04:17.055 --> 04:18.558
this family's
right to privacy?

04:18.558 --> 04:20.059
First, when the
home is empty,

04:20.059 --> 04:21.060
we enter to take
sound levels,

04:21.060 --> 04:23.062
determine where to
best place the wire.

04:23.563 --> 04:24.564
Once that's decided,

04:24.564 --> 04:26.566
the listening devi
ce will be fabricated

04:27.066 --> 04:28.568
and we will reente
r to install it.

04:28.568 --> 04:32.572
See that they limit
both entrances to
the basement only.

04:32.572 --> 04:35.074
It's not a
"better homes and
gardens" tour.

04:37.076 --> 04:38.578
Happy hunting.

04:52.091 --> 04:55.595
The coffeemaker's gotta be
plugged in for it to work!

04:58.064 --> 05:00.066
Same time
as yesterday.

05:05.571 --> 05:07.073
Listen, i'll save
you some gas.

05:07.073 --> 05:09.075
I'm just going
down to the
stationary store,

05:09.075 --> 05:10.576
then i'll
be right back.

05:10.576 --> 05:12.078
You don't gotta follow
me like yesterday.

05:12.078 --> 05:13.079
Alright?

05:16.082 --> 05:19.085
In order for the s. E. T. Te
to drop a wire in that house,

05:19.085 --> 05:21.087
there's gotta be nobody at
home for at least two hours.

05:21.587 --> 05:23.089
Actually, the maid is
gone for a little while

05:23.089 --> 05:24.090
on tuesday afternoons.

05:24.090 --> 05:25.591
Gone why?

05:25.591 --> 05:28.094
English language
classes, she's getting
a u. S. Citizenship.

05:28.094 --> 05:31.097
She's gone from the house
from 1:00 till about 2:45.

05:31.097 --> 05:32.598
An hour class,

05:32.598 --> 05:34.600
then she and her
husband usually have
a picnic lunch.

05:35.101 --> 05:38.104
He's applying for
citizenship, too.

05:38.104 --> 05:40.106
What's his
name again?

05:41.107 --> 05:43.109
Stasiu
wosilius.

05:43.609 --> 05:45.111
I'll run that by
anti- terrorism...

05:45.111 --> 05:46.112
just for laughs.

05:46.612 --> 05:49.115
Carmela's gone the same hours
on tuesday, tennis lessons.

05:49.115 --> 05:51.117
As long as we have somebody
on her during tennis,

05:51.617 --> 05:52.618
and on the maid
and tony

05:52.618 --> 05:54.120
and everybody that's
got a key to the house.

05:54.620 --> 05:56.122
The daughter's at
columbia, lives
in the dorms.

05:56.622 --> 05:59.125
Why risk it,
she's 45 minutes
away via the g. W.

05:59.125 --> 06:00.626
Put somebody on her.

06:00.626 --> 06:02.128
Anyone of them
breaks for home,

06:02.128 --> 06:05.131
we need to warn
the s. E. T. Team to get
the hell out of there.

06:42.168 --> 06:43.669
Unit one,
this is control.

06:43.669 --> 06:45.171
Baby bing
headed your way.

06:45.671 --> 06:47.173
Copy, control.

07:11.697 --> 07:14.700
Unit two, you got
badabing headed your way.

07:15.701 --> 07:17.203
Excuse me.

07:17.203 --> 07:19.705
Unit three, mrs.
Bing also in motion.

07:44.730 --> 07:47.233
Unit five, you have visu
al contact of princess bing?

07:47.233 --> 07:48.734
Roger, control.

08:00.746 --> 08:03.249
Unit four,
in approximately one minute,
you'll have the maid,

08:03.249 --> 08:04.250
gray jetta.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.252
S. E. Team, the
location reads secure.

08:06.252 --> 08:07.753
You have one hour
and 30 minutes.

08:07.753 --> 08:08.754
Roger, control.

08:25.271 --> 08:27.773
Control, we're headed into
the sausage factory.

09:18.324 --> 09:19.825
Oh, look at this.

09:19.825 --> 09:20.826
Just in time
for lunch.

09:21.327 --> 09:22.328
Set a plate.

09:22.328 --> 09:24.330
You got it.

09:24.330 --> 09:26.832
I had him dart i
t in the shoulde
r like she wanted

09:26.832 --> 09:29.335
and reinforced the hem.

09:29.335 --> 09:30.836
It shouldn't hav
e torn like that.

09:31.337 --> 09:32.338
Beautiful coat.

09:32.338 --> 09:33.339
What the fuck
you doing?

09:33.839 --> 09:34.840
Lunch is ready.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.342
Wash my hands.

09:36.342 --> 09:37.843
You just washed
your hands.

09:38.344 --> 09:39.345
Then i tied
my shoes.

09:39.345 --> 09:40.846
So what?

09:40.846 --> 09:43.349
I can't stand touching
fucking shoe laces.

09:43.349 --> 09:44.850
You ever go to
tie your shoes

09:45.351 --> 09:47.353
and you notice the end
of your laces are wet?

09:47.353 --> 09:48.854
From what?

09:48.854 --> 09:50.356
Why would
they be wet?

09:50.356 --> 09:51.857
I got no
fucking idea.

09:52.358 --> 09:54.860
You go in public bathrooms
, you stand at the urinals.

09:54.860 --> 09:55.861
Oh, c'mon,
will ya?

09:55.861 --> 09:57.363
He's asking me,
i'm tellin' him.

09:57.363 --> 09:58.864
And frankly,
it's important.

09:58.864 --> 10:00.866
Even if the
lace is dry,

10:00.866 --> 10:02.868
and even if you
don't touch the
body of the shoe.

10:02.868 --> 10:05.371
Bacteria and
virus migrate
from the sole up.

10:05.371 --> 10:06.872
You see this on tv?

10:06.872 --> 10:09.375
I gotta watc
h tv to figure
out the world?

10:09.375 --> 10:12.378
Your average men's
shit house is a
fucking sewer.

10:12.378 --> 10:13.879
You look at
ladies' johns,

10:13.879 --> 10:16.382
you could eat maple walnut
ice cream from the toilets.

10:16.882 --> 10:18.884
Ah, there's exceptions.

10:18.884 --> 10:20.886
But a men's...

10:20.886 --> 10:22.888
piss all over
the fucking floor.

10:23.389 --> 10:25.891
Urinals jammed
with cigarette
s and mothball cakes.

10:25.891 --> 10:28.894
And they can pour all
the fucking ice they want
down there, my friend,

10:28.894 --> 10:30.896
it does nothin
g to kill germs.

10:30.896 --> 10:32.398
Even if you keep
your shoes tied,

10:32.398 --> 10:34.400
and you're not dragging
your laces through urine.

10:34.400 --> 10:35.901
Shut the fuck up!

10:38.404 --> 10:40.406
Control, this
is s. E. T. Four,

10:40.406 --> 10:41.907
i have access
to the box.

10:41.907 --> 10:45.411
I'm disabling the line
to the phone company.

10:45.411 --> 10:48.414
Phone line to
the alarm company's
now neutralized.

10:48.414 --> 10:49.915
Go ahead,
cut it.

10:49.915 --> 10:52.418
Hold your breath
, i'm clipping
the siren wire.

10:54.920 --> 10:55.921
Pick it, wilson.

10:59.925 --> 11:01.927
Control, we are
working on entry,

11:01.927 --> 11:03.429
estimate
three or four minutes.

11:19.945 --> 11:21.947
You're not hungry?

11:22.948 --> 11:24.450
Have some bracioll'.

11:24.450 --> 11:25.951
No, thanks.

11:26.952 --> 11:29.455
I got no appetite.

11:30.956 --> 11:32.458
Today would've
been our birthday.

11:32.958 --> 11:34.460
Our birthday?

11:36.962 --> 11:37.963
Oh, yeah.

11:38.964 --> 11:40.966
Spoons.

11:41.967 --> 11:42.968
Hey, happy birthday.

11:42.968 --> 11:43.969
How old are you?

11:43.969 --> 11:44.970
51.

11:45.471 --> 11:47.473
Who was born first,
you or spoons?

11:47.473 --> 11:50.976
Philip was my kid
brother by 11 minutes.

11:50.976 --> 11:52.978
Hey, it was a
fucking tragedy.

11:54.980 --> 11:56.982
What are you
gonna do?

11:56.982 --> 11:59.485
It's the life we chose,
am i right, pat?

11:59.485 --> 12:02.488
But my brother was never
a heavy guy with anybody.

12:02.488 --> 12:05.491
He was a sweet,
gentle man.

12:05.491 --> 12:08.994
Your brother was
your twin brother.

12:08.994 --> 12:10.496
Philly.

12:10.496 --> 12:14.500
Friends like u
s called him "spoons".

12:16.001 --> 12:17.503
Somebody whacked
the kid

12:18.003 --> 12:20.005
a couple months
before you came over.

12:20.005 --> 12:21.507
You big mouth fuck!

12:21.507 --> 12:22.508
Fuck!

12:24.009 --> 12:29.014
It's you identical
twin or the
other kind?

12:29.014 --> 12:30.015
Identical.

12:30.015 --> 12:32.017
Here, have something
to eat.

12:33.519 --> 12:35.020
There's a twin bond.

12:36.021 --> 12:38.023
Unless you
experienced it

12:38.023 --> 12:39.525
you can't understand it.

12:39.525 --> 12:40.526
You okay with
onions, right?

12:40.526 --> 12:42.528
Maybe it sounds
fucking crazy to you.

12:43.529 --> 12:45.531
Hey, nothing sounds
crazy anymore.

12:45.531 --> 12:46.532
The older i get.

12:48.033 --> 12:50.035
It's over, right?

12:55.541 --> 12:58.544
Don't it happen that
identical twins
a lot of times,

12:58.544 --> 13:00.546
they'll die within a coupl
e of days of each other?

13:01.046 --> 13:02.548
That would've been
okay with me, believe me.

13:02.548 --> 13:04.550
Hey!

13:07.553 --> 13:10.055
I miss him so much.

13:10.055 --> 13:11.557
Well, that's natural.

13:12.558 --> 13:14.059
But you're
with us now,

13:14.059 --> 13:16.562
so why don't you leave
the morbid shit

13:16.562 --> 13:20.065
back at junior's crew
and have a happy birthday.

13:20.065 --> 13:21.066
Happy birthday.

13:21.066 --> 13:22.568
Salut.

13:22.568 --> 13:24.069
You want to
commit suicide,

13:24.570 --> 13:26.572
tie your shoes and have
a bite of bracioll'.

13:30.075 --> 13:32.077
Hey, stoonad,
it's a joke, c'mon!

13:39.084 --> 13:41.086
Hello.

13:42.087 --> 13:45.090
God don't
transfer me now.

13:45.090 --> 13:48.093
Adriana la cerva.

13:49.595 --> 13:52.097
How green was my
fucking valley?

13:52.598 --> 13:53.098
Carmela.

13:54.099 --> 13:55.100
Hi, ed.

13:55.100 --> 13:56.602
Hey.

13:56.602 --> 13:59.104
This is my friend
i was telling you about,
adriana la cerva.

13:59.104 --> 14:00.105
Ed restuccia.

14:00.606 --> 14:02.608
Well, i'm delighted to
teach any pal of carm's.

14:02.608 --> 14:05.110
She's my most
disciplined student.

14:05.110 --> 14:07.112
Perfect muscle tone
doesn't hurt either.

14:08.614 --> 14:11.116
Unfortunately, listen,
i have to apologize, carm.

14:11.617 --> 14:12.618
I thought i
called everybody.

14:12.618 --> 14:14.620
But i'm not gonna be
teaching here anymore.

14:16.622 --> 14:18.123
Everything's alright,
i hope.

14:18.123 --> 14:21.627
Yeah, basically, kitty got
this dot- com job in san diego.

14:21.627 --> 14:24.129
So, we're moving.

14:24.129 --> 14:25.631
I didn't even know
you were married.

14:26.131 --> 14:27.132
Yeah.

14:28.133 --> 14:29.635
But you're in luck.

14:29.635 --> 14:31.136
Birgit here is
taking over for me.

14:31.637 --> 14:32.638
How wonderful.

14:33.138 --> 14:35.140
I never even
played like once.

14:35.140 --> 14:36.642
That's why
you're here.

14:37.142 --> 14:38.644
Oh, carm,
before you start,

14:38.644 --> 14:41.146
it'll really help
if i can get letters
of recommendation.

14:51.657 --> 14:53.659
Oh, by the way,
this company
kitty's joining,

14:53.659 --> 14:55.160
they sell antiques
on the web,

14:55.160 --> 14:56.662
so if you ever wanted
a special piece...

14:57.162 --> 14:59.665
i don't have antiques,
my house is traditional.

14:59.665 --> 15:01.667
Um, i'm cutting in
to your lesson, sorry.

15:01.667 --> 15:03.168
Carmela, bye.

15:03.669 --> 15:04.670
Nice meeting you.

15:04.670 --> 15:05.671
Take care.

15:18.183 --> 15:20.185
Baby bing is leaving
school property.

15:20.185 --> 15:22.187
I'm on it.

15:23.689 --> 15:24.690
Taking orders, dude.

15:24.690 --> 15:25.190
Peach snapple.

15:25.691 --> 15:26.191
Me, too.

15:26.191 --> 15:27.192
I only g
ot two bucks.

15:29.695 --> 15:32.197
Mrs. Celeste almost saw
my board in my locker.

15:32.197 --> 15:34.700
What kind of retard rule
is that, no boards at school?

15:34.700 --> 15:37.202
Why can't they see how usefu
boards would be at school?

15:37.202 --> 15:38.704
Like in the cafeteria.

15:38.704 --> 15:41.707
Each person on line coul
d just roll past the food pans

15:41.707 --> 15:44.209
or whatever and make
the decisions in
like half the time.

15:44.209 --> 15:45.210
Yeah.

15:45.210 --> 15:46.712
That food tastes
like ass anyway.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.221
Alright, hit it!

16:06.732 --> 16:08.233
I only had eno
ugh for one snapple.

16:08.233 --> 16:09.735
A. J. , give me a hit
of your snapple.

16:09.735 --> 16:10.736
Don't backwash.

16:12.237 --> 16:14.239
I'm not doing anything
for this school.

16:14.239 --> 16:15.741
My mom's all
,"get involved".

16:15.741 --> 16:17.743
It's like,"hello,
i am involved...

16:17.743 --> 16:18.744
with boarding."

16:19.244 --> 16:20.245
Oh, it's egon.

16:20.746 --> 16:21.747
Hey, kosma.

16:22.247 --> 16:23.749
Okay!

16:29.254 --> 16:30.255

16:30.255 --> 16:31.256
Orthodontist.

16:31.256 --> 16:32.257

16:32.257 --> 16:33.759
What class you

16:33.759 --> 16:34.760

16:34.760 --> 16:36.261
Excellent jersey.

16:36.762 --> 16:38.263
Yeah, wait...

16:38.263 --> 16:39.765
you went out
for j. V. Ball?

16:39.765 --> 16:41.266
Yeah.

16:41.266 --> 16:43.268
Excuse me, m
r. Quadripleg
ic of the future.

16:43.268 --> 16:44.770
Remind me no
t to visit you
in the hospital.

16:45.270 --> 16:46.271
It is a cool shirt.

16:46.271 --> 16:47.272
Yeah.

16:49.274 --> 16:50.275
Whoa!

16:50.275 --> 16:51.276
What position?

16:51.276 --> 16:52.277
Douchebag.

17:08.292 --> 17:09.795
Okay, cut it!

17:16.801 --> 17:19.304
...jell- o shots...

17:19.304 --> 17:21.306

17:21.306 --> 17:22.808
on bhs,

17:22.808 --> 17:25.310
fight right
through that line!

17:25.310 --> 17:27.813
Run that ball
to the goal line!

17:29.815 --> 17:31.316
Y'all
should've come.

17:32.818 --> 17:33.819
Where'd you go?

17:34.319 --> 17:37.322
We started off
at smoke's as usual,

17:37.322 --> 17:41.326
but we wound up
at this place ruby
foos'round, um...

17:41.326 --> 17:44.329
broadway and 65th
or something.

17:44.830 --> 17:47.332
It was so fun.

17:47.332 --> 17:50.335
God, did i
get hammered.

17:50.335 --> 17:51.837
Don't you have
a quiz today?

17:51.837 --> 17:54.840
Frosh week technically
ended at midnight.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.341
What do they expect?

17:56.341 --> 17:57.843
I'll study now.

17:57.843 --> 17:59.344
I know, i
have a bio lab,

17:59.344 --> 18:01.346
i haven't read
any of the chapters.

18:02.347 --> 18:04.349
Aww...

18:04.349 --> 18:05.851
still miss
new jersey?

18:06.351 --> 18:08.353
It's only like
half an hour away.

18:08.353 --> 18:10.355
It's just
this transition.

18:10.856 --> 18:11.857
It's a lot of work.

18:11.857 --> 18:14.860
I just think new york
is an experience

18:14.860 --> 18:16.862
that unalterably
changes a person.

18:17.362 --> 18:18.363
It is really great.

18:18.864 --> 18:21.366
All this freedom
of college.

18:32.878 --> 18:34.880
When did you have
your last cocktail?

18:34.880 --> 18:37.382
11:30 this morning.

18:37.382 --> 18:39.334
Jesus, caitlin.

18:57.853 --> 18:59.855
"What is the most
important right

18:59.855 --> 19:01.857
guaranteed to
united states
citizens?"

19:01.857 --> 19:03.358
Right to vote.

19:05.861 --> 19:07.863
Special capers
from italy.

19:07.863 --> 19:09.865
Soprano kids
don't like them.

19:11.366 --> 19:13.869
"Who wrote'the star
spangled banner'?"

19:13.869 --> 19:15.370
Martin luther king.

19:15.370 --> 19:17.372
Stasiu,
you know this.

19:17.372 --> 19:19.374
I want to eat.

19:21.376 --> 19:22.878
Francis scott key.

19:26.381 --> 19:28.884
"What holiday was celebrated
for the first time

19:29.384 --> 19:30.886
by the american colonists?"

19:30.886 --> 19:32.387
Martin luther king.

19:32.387 --> 19:33.388
Stasiu!

19:33.388 --> 19:35.891
That's answer
to number 49,

19:35.891 --> 19:38.393
"who was civil
rights leader?"

19:41.396 --> 19:43.398
Which sandwich
is for you?

19:43.398 --> 19:44.900
I don't care.

19:59.915 --> 20:01.416
Ready.

20:01.917 --> 20:03.919
Start shooting
over here.

20:05.420 --> 20:06.922
Back in lodz,

20:06.922 --> 20:10.926
i was an engineer
with 20 employees

20:10.926 --> 20:13.929
and a grant from the sta
te to do autonomous research.

20:15.430 --> 20:17.933
Oh, it bores you?

20:22.437 --> 20:23.939
Don't take those
steak knives out.

20:24.439 --> 20:26.942
Put them with capers,
i take them home.

20:40.455 --> 20:42.457
That's just for
anthony jr.

20:42.457 --> 20:44.459
Looks like they're
expecting world war iii.

20:44.459 --> 20:46.461
More likely
the columbo wars.

20:47.963 --> 20:49.464
Hey, he's got
the black & decker.

20:49.965 --> 20:51.967
I got one of those.

20:58.473 --> 21:00.475
120- gallon
water heater.

21:00.475 --> 21:02.978
My house we're shivering
after a shower and a half.

21:03.478 --> 21:05.981
Whoa, wait a
minute, go back.

21:07.482 --> 21:09.484
Look at the brown water,
right there, freeze it.

21:09.985 --> 21:10.485
What?

21:10.986 --> 21:11.987
You don't see it?

21:13.488 --> 21:15.991
Creep forward, give us
some magnification.

21:17.492 --> 21:18.994
That baby's
gonna blow.

21:18.994 --> 21:20.495
My dad was a plumber.

21:20.495 --> 21:22.497
Tony's got about six months
left to go on that lining.

21:22.497 --> 21:24.499
Aw, it's a shame that
we can't warn him.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.002
Maybe during the discovery
phase of his rico trial,

21:27.002 --> 21:29.004
we can inform his lawy
er that tony needs a plumber.

21:29.504 --> 21:31.006
Except that's
at least a
year from now

21:31.006 --> 21:33.008
and by that
time...boom!

21:35.010 --> 21:38.013
Okay, now you
see that lamp there?

21:56.031 --> 21:58.033
Is that the c- 140
microphone?

21:58.033 --> 21:59.534
They took
sound readings.

21:59.534 --> 22:01.036
That's a new one.

22:01.536 --> 22:03.538
Assumption is
the wiseguys
stand and talk

22:03.538 --> 22:05.540
where the air
conditioning's loudest.

22:05.540 --> 22:07.542
And that's where
we're gonna place it.

22:31.066 --> 22:33.068
When's this puppy
going in?

22:34.069 --> 22:35.570
Tomorrow.

22:56.091 --> 22:58.593
Okay, fellas and gals,
our big day.

22:58.593 --> 23:00.595
And as i speak
, i have baby bing...

23:00.595 --> 23:03.098
right on time.

23:03.098 --> 23:04.599
Handing off to
you, george.

23:12.107 --> 23:14.609
I'm on baby bing's
car pool vehicle.

23:24.619 --> 23:27.122
Furio giunta
cadillac dts returning.

23:27.622 --> 23:30.125
Went past me up the street
about five minutes ago.

23:30.625 --> 23:31.626
Well, well, well.

23:31.626 --> 23:34.129
Der bingle's up early today,
he's in the caddy.

23:34.129 --> 23:36.131
Copied, i've got
the handoff.

23:36.131 --> 23:37.632
Roger that.

24:02.657 --> 24:04.159
How's the
new stock doing?

24:04.159 --> 24:06.161
Up three at the close
of the dow yesterday.

24:06.161 --> 24:07.662
Another two
so far today.

24:08.163 --> 24:09.664
Beautiful.

24:09.664 --> 24:13.168
Listen, ton', i think
we may have a problem.

24:13.668 --> 24:14.669
Log off.

24:14.669 --> 24:16.671
That cookies shit
makes me nervous.

24:18.173 --> 24:21.676
I think we may have
a problem about our
friend, the twin.

24:22.177 --> 24:23.178
Yeah, so?

24:23.178 --> 24:24.679
My goombah,
joey flies,

24:24.679 --> 24:26.681
he hangs out at the
nest in bloomfield.

24:27.182 --> 24:28.183
Gyp la monica's place.

24:28.183 --> 24:29.184
Yeah.

24:29.184 --> 24:30.685
So, our friend is
a fixture down there

24:30.685 --> 24:34.156
and joey says lately he's been
into the booze very heavy.

24:34.156 --> 24:35.157
He's all fucked up.

24:35.657 --> 24:38.160
A couple of times, i had to
pick him up off the floor.

24:38.160 --> 24:39.661
So, chip went to him.

24:40.162 --> 24:41.663
"Pat, what the fuck?

24:41.663 --> 24:44.666
Can i do anything",
etcetera.

24:44.666 --> 24:47.169
Patsy launches into
this single malt diatribe

24:47.169 --> 24:49.171
about how people can
smile in your face

24:49.171 --> 24:50.672
and still
be a villain

24:51.173 --> 24:53.175
and that he knows
how his brother died

24:53.175 --> 24:56.178
and who's responsible
and all that there.

24:56.178 --> 24:57.179
He mention me
by name?

24:57.179 --> 24:59.181
No, me neither.

25:01.683 --> 25:03.185
You hearing this?

25:03.185 --> 25:05.187
How the fuck would patsy
know we clipped spoons?

25:05.687 --> 25:07.189
What, that fucking
twin telepathy?

25:07.689 --> 25:10.192
Somebody's putting
ideas in this
kid's head.

25:10.192 --> 25:13.195
Sweet shot, really
beautiful shot.

25:13.195 --> 25:15.697
He just set himself
up perfectly on
this hole...

25:15.697 --> 25:18.700
don't let us interfere
with your golf game.

25:18.700 --> 25:20.702
Maybe a cop
trying to flip him.

25:21.703 --> 25:24.706
Getting him worked
up with theories.

25:28.210 --> 25:29.711
He was talking weird
the other day.

25:29.711 --> 25:31.213
What should we do?

25:31.213 --> 25:32.714
We brought him ove
r from junior's crew

25:32.714 --> 25:34.216
to keep an
eye on him.

25:35.217 --> 25:36.718
So, that's what
we'll keep doing.

25:38.220 --> 25:40.222
I mean, make
no mistake.

25:40.222 --> 25:42.224
Part of this guy
loves you.

25:42.224 --> 25:45.227
But it's gotta be hard
coming into work every day

25:45.727 --> 25:47.729
looking right into the eyes
of the guy you know

25:47.729 --> 25:49.731
ordered your
brother whacked.

25:49.731 --> 25:51.733
And even having
to smile.

25:53.235 --> 25:55.237
We always
have the option.

26:01.743 --> 26:04.746
Mrs. Bing in motion.

26:05.247 --> 26:07.249
S. E. Team, we got the
housekeeper to wait out,

26:07.249 --> 26:09.251
then the house
is all yours.

26:22.264 --> 26:24.266
Hit low to
high, carmela

26:24.766 --> 26:26.768
and think
about your grip.

26:28.270 --> 26:29.271
Fuck!

26:29.271 --> 26:30.772
No, that's good.

26:30.772 --> 26:32.774
Nice extension.

26:32.774 --> 26:33.775
Ah!

26:33.775 --> 26:35.777
Racquet back,
carmela, c'mon!

26:41.283 --> 26:41.783
Fuck.

26:41.783 --> 26:43.285
No, that's good.

26:43.285 --> 26:45.287
Shouldn't that housekeeper
be out of there?

26:45.287 --> 26:46.788
Edge closer,
take a look.

26:48.290 --> 26:49.291
Ow!

26:49.291 --> 26:51.793
Okay, guys,
collect.

26:51.793 --> 26:54.296
Actually, ade, let m
e work with you here.

26:54.796 --> 26:56.298
Carm, you collect.

27:10.312 --> 27:13.315
Maid's car's
still here.

27:17.319 --> 27:20.322
Okay, let's just focus,
be serious...

27:21.323 --> 27:23.325
and follow through.

27:23.825 --> 27:25.827
Right, right.

27:25.827 --> 27:27.829
Almost, almost.

27:34.836 --> 27:36.338
Did you hear
something?

27:36.338 --> 27:37.839
I don't know.

27:42.844 --> 27:44.846
We think we
heard something.

27:44.846 --> 27:47.849
From inside the
sausage factory.

27:47.849 --> 27:49.351
Hold your position.

27:51.853 --> 27:52.854
Okay.

27:53.355 --> 27:54.356
Stand up straight,
okay?

27:54.356 --> 27:55.357
Okay.

27:55.357 --> 27:56.858
Here you go.

27:56.858 --> 27:58.860
Low to high.

27:58.860 --> 28:00.362
I can't do this
with you.

28:18.880 --> 28:20.882
She's leaving
the court.

28:32.394 --> 28:34.896
Der bingle's leaving
the bing, too.

28:49.911 --> 28:50.912
This does
not look good.

28:50.912 --> 28:54.416
Mrs. Bing bearing north
on grandview avenue.

28:58.420 --> 28:59.921
She's turned
onto foxwood road.

28:59.921 --> 29:01.923
She's heading
toward the factory.

29:07.429 --> 29:09.931
Abort,
repeat, abort.

29:09.931 --> 29:12.434
S. E. Team get the hell
out of there now!

29:12.434 --> 29:14.436
Abort, andy,
it's not a go.

29:14.436 --> 29:16.438
Repeat, we
are not a go.

29:34.456 --> 29:36.458
It must be a crisis
with one of the children.

29:36.458 --> 29:40.462
Control, i place baby bing
in the school building.

29:40.462 --> 29:42.464
Unit five report.

29:42.464 --> 29:44.466
That's a big roger
from this end, too.

29:44.466 --> 29:46.968
She went into her room
about two minutes ago.

29:46.968 --> 29:49.471
I heard her tell her friend
she was gonna get some sleep.

29:49.971 --> 29:51.473
You think
somebody made us?

29:51.473 --> 29:53.475
I don't know.

29:53.475 --> 29:56.478
But we're finished
for today here,
ladies and gentlemen.

30:04.486 --> 30:06.488
10 years.

30:06.988 --> 30:09.991
10 fucking years he
said this fucking
thing would last!

30:09.991 --> 30:10.992
Fuck!

30:11.493 --> 30:12.494
You said that, tony.

30:12.494 --> 30:13.495
Are you doing
anything over there?

30:13.995 --> 30:15.997
I told you not to put
this shit down here!

30:21.503 --> 30:22.504
Fuck!

30:23.505 --> 30:24.506
Fuck!

30:24.506 --> 30:26.508
Never mind tha
t, save the pictures.

30:37.519 --> 30:39.020
The prom.

30:39.020 --> 30:41.523
Look at this,
fucking ruined.

30:41.523 --> 30:43.525
Mr. Ruggerio
, thank god.

30:44.025 --> 30:45.527
The fucking
water heater blew.

30:46.027 --> 30:47.529
Just blew!

30:47.529 --> 30:50.532
Your guarantee's
gotta be expired by now.

30:52.534 --> 30:53.535
Madonn'.

30:55.537 --> 30:57.038
Do we have any idea
what went down?

30:57.038 --> 30:58.540
No.

30:58.540 --> 31:00.542
It's a family
emergency of
some sort.

31:00.542 --> 31:02.043
The plumber's truc
k went up there.

31:02.043 --> 31:05.046
Look, we don't
have any idea
what happened, so...

31:06.047 --> 31:08.550
let's not speculate.

31:08.550 --> 31:11.553
All i know is that
we're shit out of luck
till next tuesday.

31:11.553 --> 31:15.557
Send somebody up
there tomorrow,
stake the house out.

31:15.557 --> 31:18.560
Maybe we got a
long- term problem.

31:18.560 --> 31:21.563
Well, we're heading
back to quantico.

31:21.563 --> 31:25.066
We got a job in denver
day after tomorrow.

31:25.066 --> 31:26.067
A mosque.

31:34.075 --> 31:35.076
Morning.

31:35.577 --> 31:36.578
Hi.

31:36.578 --> 31:38.079
We'd like to get onto your property

31:38.079 --> 31:39.581
so we can trim some
growth in the back

31:40.081 --> 31:41.583
that's posing a safety hazard

31:41.583 --> 31:43.585
with all the powerline
s running through there.

31:44.586 --> 31:46.087
Okay.

31:46.087 --> 31:47.589
Go around
the side.

31:47.589 --> 31:49.090
While we're at it,

31:49.591 --> 31:51.092
our records show t
hat our repair department

31:51.593 --> 31:53.094
had some crews
out here yesterday.

31:53.094 --> 31:56.097
Were you affected
by any of the
shortfalls?

31:56.598 --> 31:58.600
Yesterday?

31:59.601 --> 32:00.602
No.

32:01.603 --> 32:03.605
Oh.

32:03.605 --> 32:06.107
The people next door
have had some trucks
go up there i think,

32:06.107 --> 32:08.610
but, no,
we've been fine.

32:09.611 --> 32:11.112
How about them?

32:11.112 --> 32:13.615
Do you know if
everything's okay
over there?

32:14.115 --> 32:17.118
As far as i know.

32:17.118 --> 32:19.120
Well, we'll go
talk to them.

32:19.120 --> 32:21.623
Probably you should.

32:22.624 --> 32:24.125
They're in the--

32:24.125 --> 32:25.126
pardon?

32:27.629 --> 32:28.630
Nothing.

32:29.130 --> 32:31.633
They're different.

32:31.633 --> 32:32.634
For this neighborhood,

32:32.634 --> 32:34.636
they're a little
different, that's all.

32:36.137 --> 32:38.139
We'll get busy
in the back.

32:38.139 --> 32:39.641
Thanks.

32:47.649 --> 32:49.651
Still nothing
out of the ordinary.

32:49.651 --> 32:52.153
Is the kid home
sick from school?

32:54.155 --> 32:55.156
I don't see him.

32:55.156 --> 32:57.659
But, i see an arm,
a piece of robe.

32:57.659 --> 32:59.160
It could be tony.

32:59.160 --> 33:02.163
He's eating
sugar pops.

33:02.163 --> 33:04.165
Wait, somebody just walked
past the kitchen window.

33:05.166 --> 33:06.668
No, that's the maid.

33:08.670 --> 33:09.671
They're good.

33:10.171 --> 33:11.673
Fresh this morning,
ferrara's.

33:11.673 --> 33:13.174
How are things over
on bloomfield avenue?

33:13.174 --> 33:16.678
The cuban was at
the casino last night.

33:16.678 --> 33:19.681
And by the way,
big john's okay
with a 60- 40 split

33:19.681 --> 33:21.683
because we own
the building.

33:21.683 --> 33:22.684
What the hell?

33:23.184 --> 33:23.685
What?

33:29.691 --> 33:32.193
What the fuck,
is that pat parisi?

33:35.196 --> 33:36.698
Oh, shit.

33:41.703 --> 33:43.204
What should we do?

33:55.216 --> 33:56.217
He's drunk!

33:56.718 --> 33:58.219
Anyway, i told johnny,
i says,"look--

33:58.219 --> 33:59.721
let's talk
downstairs.

34:11.232 --> 34:12.734
Motherfucker...

34:15.235 --> 34:17.237
i don't understand
this at all.

34:19.239 --> 34:20.742
Cocksucker.

34:38.760 --> 34:42.263
What's up, ike?

34:42.263 --> 34:45.266
What happened at
the soprano house was
the water heater blew.

34:47.268 --> 34:48.770
Our unit saw ruggerio
come back with a flatbed

34:49.270 --> 34:50.271
and haul the old one out.

34:50.772 --> 34:51.773
Ruggerio...

34:52.273 --> 34:53.274
a plumber?

34:53.775 --> 34:55.275
Why?

34:55.275 --> 34:57.278
My sister used t
o live up near there.

34:57.278 --> 34:59.280
She was friend
s with mrs. Ruggerio.

34:59.280 --> 35:01.783
Yeah, it's mr. Ruggerio's
neighborhood.

35:03.284 --> 35:05.286
Anyway, we have to
get this thing in there

35:05.286 --> 35:07.288
before our warrant
goes stale.

35:07.288 --> 35:09.791
Boy, we've had eve
ry one of tony's phones

35:09.791 --> 35:12.293
bugged for four years.

35:12.293 --> 35:14.796
But the guy says
less than harpo marx.

35:14.796 --> 35:16.297
Next tuesday.

35:16.297 --> 35:18.299
The wire drop's
a definite go.

35:22.804 --> 35:24.806
Der bingle has
left the building.

35:29.310 --> 35:31.813
They fucking
made me.

35:31.813 --> 35:34.315
Wire drop is
still a go.

35:34.315 --> 35:36.818
Confirming access
to switching box.

35:37.318 --> 35:38.820
I'm going in.

35:44.325 --> 35:47.328
Unit two,
mrs. Bing in motion.

35:48.830 --> 35:50.832
Just the maid
and it's all yours.

35:51.332 --> 35:52.834
Copy that.

35:54.836 --> 35:57.338
Siren wire's cut.

35:59.340 --> 36:02.343
The teacher
knows nothing.

36:02.343 --> 36:05.346
Why do you quarrel
with him always?

36:05.346 --> 36:07.849
English is his
first language.

36:07.849 --> 36:09.851
C'mon,
waste our time

36:09.851 --> 36:11.853
with those childish
trick questions.

36:11.853 --> 36:13.855
"Stop,
men at work".

36:13.855 --> 36:15.356
And how do we know
it doesn't mean

36:15.356 --> 36:18.359
"stop all men
who are working"?

36:18.359 --> 36:20.862
He shouldn't have taken
a point off my grade.

36:20.862 --> 36:23.865
He thinks i'm a ha
ck cabbie from pakistan.

36:24.866 --> 36:26.367
Lilli, lilli!

36:26.367 --> 36:27.869
Where ar
e you going?

36:27.869 --> 36:29.871
I'm going
back to work!

36:41.883 --> 36:43.384
Excuse me, ma'am.

36:43.384 --> 36:44.385
Scared me.

36:44.385 --> 36:45.887
I'm sorry,
can you tell me,

36:45.887 --> 36:47.889
is the west essex
language school
around here?

36:48.389 --> 36:48.890
There.

36:49.891 --> 36:51.893
Is it coed?

36:51.893 --> 36:53.394
What?

36:53.394 --> 36:55.897
You wouldn't happen
to be polish by any
chance, would you?

36:56.397 --> 36:56.898
Yes.

36:58.399 --> 37:01.402
My grandmother
is polish.

37:11.412 --> 37:13.414
It's locked today.

37:18.920 --> 37:20.421
Yeah, yeah,
my grandmother, she--

37:20.421 --> 37:21.923
excuse me.

37:21.923 --> 37:23.925
How can i
help you, sir?

37:23.925 --> 37:25.927
I was just wonderi
ng if i could ask you

37:25.927 --> 37:27.929
a few questions ab
out the language school.

37:28.429 --> 37:29.931
How is it?

37:30.932 --> 37:33.434
Sweet mother
of jesus.

37:34.435 --> 37:35.937
Look at her today.

37:43.945 --> 37:44.946
Hi, ade!

37:45.947 --> 37:47.448
Hi, guys!

37:47.448 --> 37:48.950
Be back
in a second.

37:48.950 --> 37:51.452
Listen to this
now,"hi, ade!"

37:53.454 --> 37:54.455
Hi.

37:55.456 --> 37:56.958
Hey, you.

37:58.960 --> 38:00.461
I love those.

38:00.461 --> 38:01.963
Oh, yeah?

38:01.963 --> 38:03.965
Oh, my god.

38:03.965 --> 38:05.466
Where did you
get them?

38:05.967 --> 38:07.468
Near my house.

38:07.468 --> 38:09.470
Ay- ay- ay.

38:18.980 --> 38:21.482
Wait, wait, wait,
this table's been moved.

38:21.482 --> 38:22.984
Cleanup fr
om the flood.

38:22.984 --> 38:24.986
It's not under
the right duct anymore.

38:24.986 --> 38:26.487
Should we
move it back?

38:26.487 --> 38:28.990
What, two, three feet,
who's gonna notice?

38:28.990 --> 38:32.493
Yeah, you know, wait,
wait, wait, somebody might.

38:32.493 --> 38:35.496
You gotta figure though,
normal course of events,

38:35.496 --> 38:38.499
tony will assume carmela
moved it back or the maid.

38:38.499 --> 38:40.501
If anybody
even notices.

38:40.501 --> 38:42.503
Make an
executive decision.

38:42.503 --> 38:44.005
Grab an end.

38:45.506 --> 38:47.008
Easy, easy.

38:47.008 --> 38:48.509
When hadley heard i
was deferring a year,

38:49.010 --> 38:51.512
she was like,
"well that's sketchy."

38:53.514 --> 38:56.017
Steve said eric scatin
o hates montclair state.

38:56.017 --> 38:57.518
And he's been doin
g all this acid.

38:57.518 --> 38:59.520
God, he was
so straightedge.

39:00.021 --> 39:01.022
Hi, caitlin.

39:01.522 --> 39:03.024
Hi.

39:03.524 --> 39:06.527
This is hunter, my
friend from home i
was telling you about.

39:13.034 --> 39:14.535
Wow.

39:16.037 --> 39:18.539
Do you like
citron jell- o shots?

39:18.539 --> 39:21.542
Actually, i haven't had
any alcohol in a week.

39:21.542 --> 39:25.046
I know, i was gonna
say we should go
over to panchito's,

39:25.046 --> 39:27.048
but i remembered,
bad idea.

39:29.550 --> 39:31.552
I went over to
the health center.

39:31.552 --> 39:33.554
That problem
swallowing thing?

39:33.554 --> 39:36.057
They gave me this
prescription for buspar.

39:36.057 --> 39:38.059
That's for like,
anxiety, right?

39:39.060 --> 39:41.562
I guess.

39:41.562 --> 39:43.564
There was like,
this weightlifter guy

39:43.564 --> 39:45.066
on the subway today.

39:45.066 --> 39:47.068
And he was eating thes
e cacciatore chicken parts

39:47.568 --> 39:49.070
from this massive
tupperware thing

39:49.070 --> 39:51.572
and spitting the bon
es back in the container.

39:51.572 --> 39:53.074
And the whole car...

39:53.074 --> 39:54.575
reeked.

39:54.575 --> 39:56.077
This poor blind man
sitting next to him.

39:56.577 --> 39:59.580
I mean, you could tell
he felt completely invaded.

39:59.580 --> 40:02.083
We all did.

40:02.083 --> 40:05.586
Everybody just stared
straight ahead.

40:05.586 --> 40:07.088
New york.

40:46.127 --> 40:47.628
Hey.

40:53.134 --> 40:56.137

41:30.671 --> 41:32.673
I like being here.

41:32.673 --> 41:34.175
You sure?

41:34.175 --> 41:35.176
Yeah.

41:35.626 --> 41:36.627
You sure?

41:36.627 --> 41:38.128
Yeah.

41:38.128 --> 41:40.631
Don't say you're sure
if you're not sure.

41:47.638 --> 41:50.641
Who was telling me you bought
your daughter a nice house

41:50.641 --> 41:53.143
after you came
over with us?

41:54.645 --> 41:56.647
Yeah, that's nice.

41:56.647 --> 41:58.148
Wonderful thing.

42:03.654 --> 42:06.156
And your brother,
a buon anima.

42:08.158 --> 42:10.160
You've recovered
from that shit there.

42:10.160 --> 42:12.663
You put your grief
behind you.

42:21.171 --> 42:22.673
You put your grief
behind you.

42:26.176 --> 42:28.178
Let me hear
you say it.

42:32.182 --> 42:35.185
I put the grief
behind me.

42:36.687 --> 42:39.690
I'm gonna go get
a coffee and a bun.

42:45.696 --> 42:47.197
You got a younger
son too, right?

42:47.698 --> 42:49.199
You oughta bring him
up to the house.

42:49.199 --> 42:50.701
He can hang
out with a. J.

42:50.701 --> 42:51.702
We can get
something to eat.

42:51.702 --> 42:53.704
They can go
in the pool.

43:04.715 --> 43:07.217
We'll have to leav
e this junk on the table.

43:07.718 --> 43:10.220
Don't know
where to put it.

43:12.723 --> 43:14.224
Control,

43:14.224 --> 43:16.727
Loud and clear,

43:29.239 --> 43:30.741
Control,
we're in motion.

43:30.741 --> 43:32.242
We have left the
sausage factory.

43:32.242 --> 43:33.243
Touchdown.

43:33.744 --> 43:35.746
Dig, soprano,
c'mon, dig it!

43:35.746 --> 43:37.247
You wanted to jo
in the football team.

43:37.247 --> 43:39.750
You think it's all for
show and not for go?

43:39.750 --> 43:41.752
Dig in,
you chubette!

43:41.752 --> 43:43.253
You're out of
there, george.

43:43.253 --> 43:45.255
Unit three,
we're in.

44:07.277 --> 44:08.779
So, i got
a job for you.

44:08.779 --> 44:10.280
Right.

44:10.781 --> 44:12.783
It might get
a little messy.

44:12.783 --> 44:14.284
I understand.

44:14.284 --> 44:16.286
Wet work.

44:16.286 --> 44:18.789
Alright.

44:18.789 --> 44:20.791
I'll make it
worth your while,

44:20.791 --> 44:21.792

y about that.

44:22.292 --> 44:24.294
I'm not worried.

44:27.297 --> 44:28.799
Look over here.

44:28.799 --> 44:31.301
Minimization,

e goddamn place.

44:37.307 --> 44:40.811

mildew, you know?

44:40.811 --> 44:42.312
So, lilliana say
s you're an engineer.

44:42.312 --> 44:44.314
I figured maybe you
could rig some system.

44:44.815 --> 44:47.818
If it happens
again, some pvc
shit or something.

44:47.818 --> 44:49.820
So, if it happens again,
you get the overflow

44:49.820 --> 44:50.821
and you put it over
into the corner over there

44:51.321 --> 44:52.823
to a sump pump.

44:52.823 --> 44:54.825
You chip out
the concrete.

44:54.825 --> 44:56.326
4- 0.

44:56.326 --> 44:57.828

t discussing oc.

45:14.344 --> 45:15.846
Whatever.

45:15.846 --> 45:17.848
Well, how much?

45:19.349 --> 45:21.852
Time, materials.

45:21.852 --> 45:24.354
I don't know how to
concoct estimate.

45:24.855 --> 45:26.356
Hmm, well.

45:27.357 --> 45:28.859
Fair enough.

45:29.359 --> 45:30.861

meadow's laundry anyway.

45:49.880 --> 45:51.381

45:51.882 --> 45:53.884
Lilliana's making
her a leg of
lamb to take back.

45:54.384 --> 45:55.886

46:02.392 --> 46:03.393

this morning.

46:54.945 --> 46:56.446
Vienna roast.

46:56.446 --> 46:58.448
It's not as acidic
as the italian.

46:59.950 --> 47:01.451
Cleaned me right out.

47:01.451 --> 47:04.955
What you need is more roughage
overall in your diet

47:04.955 --> 47:06.456
is what you need.

47:07.958 --> 47:10.961
I've had something stuck
in my teeth for two days now.

47:10.961 --> 47:12.462
Jesus.

47:12.462 --> 47:14.464
