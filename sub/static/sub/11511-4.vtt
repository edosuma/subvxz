WEBVTT

00:00.433 --> 00:02.940
- Previously, on Game of Silence...
- We have a witness outside

00:02.980 --> 00:04.553
‭Darryl's home the night
he was killed...

00:04.593 --> 00:05.493
care to revise that story?

00:05.520 --> 00:06.910
They went after my number two.

00:06.946 --> 00:08.574
This guy knows enough
to come after Darryl,

00:08.626 --> 00:09.968
then you might be next.

00:10.020 --> 00:10.941
I say we take them all down,

00:10.993 --> 00:12.860
and we do it in a way
that no one can deny.

00:12.895 --> 00:15.210
RAY (over phone): You really
don't want to kick this rock.

00:15.245 --> 00:17.700
- I know what you did.
- JESSIE: Nobody knows what happened.

00:17.752 --> 00:19.266
It's a shame your memory's so spotty,

00:19.301 --> 00:21.218
especially when it comes
to the warden's little parties.

00:21.270 --> 00:23.120
- What'd you do, Gil?
- I shot Bobby.

00:23.155 --> 00:24.972
We said we're gonna do this right!

00:25.007 --> 00:25.639
We ain't stupid!

00:25.674 --> 00:26.582
We got rid of the body.

00:26.584 --> 00:27.759
JACKSON: You screwed us.

00:27.811 --> 00:30.327
We still have a confession on camera!

00:30.863 --> 00:31.895
I'm out.

00:31.897 --> 00:33.213
Afternoon, ma'am.

00:33.265 --> 00:34.131
The nursery guy left that

00:34.166 --> 00:36.183
- for you.
- The nursery guy?

00:36.235 --> 00:38.418
JESSIE: I mean, I always assumed
it was horrible at Quitman,

00:38.454 --> 00:41.622
just nothing as horrible
as what I heard on that tape.

00:41.674 --> 00:44.024
- Why didn't you tell me?
- GIL: I want to tell you.

There's no job.

02:21.941 --> 02:23.707
Just trying to figure out our next move.

02:23.709 --> 02:26.143
Well, what do you mean, your next move?

02:26.939 --> 02:27.844
I thought that...

02:27.880 --> 02:28.819
We ain't done, baby.

02:30.265 --> 02:31.632
There's people need to pay still.

Just 'cause Jackson
ran off doesn't mean...

02:34.386 --> 02:35.555
the plan goes to hell.

02:37.370 --> 02:39.172
I'm not worried about Jackson.

02:39.907 --> 02:41.233
I'm worried about you.

02:41.268 --> 02:43.260
The Bobby Marks thing,
what happened there,

02:43.295 --> 02:44.528
I'm not gonna do that again.

02:45.003 --> 02:48.115
But I have zero regrets.

02:55.107 --> 02:56.823
(chuckles)

02:56.859 --> 02:59.543
(muttering)

03:00.325 --> 03:01.395
Bye.

03:01.447 --> 03:02.197
Bye.

03:03.999 --> 03:05.053
That looks great, but you might need

03:05.088 --> 03:07.701
to bring this stake in
just a foot. Thank you.

03:07.753 --> 03:09.853
Uh, guys, the tables
all along the back here,

03:09.888 --> 03:11.705
and the bar goes by the pool.

03:11.740 --> 03:13.916
JACKSON: How we doing?
Running those cords down?

03:14.342 --> 03:15.659
Thank you.

03:19.381 --> 03:21.431
Hey, what's going on?

03:21.483 --> 03:22.270
Hey.

03:22.918 --> 03:23.879
I got a deal, uh,

03:24.052 --> 03:26.186
on a security system upgrade.

03:26.221 --> 03:28.572
Motion-detecting cameras, panic button.

03:28.607 --> 03:29.723
I figured, why not?

03:29.758 --> 03:30.707
This had to happen today?

03:30.709 --> 03:32.109
Did you not notice the engagement party

03:32.161 --> 03:33.193
sprouting in our backyard?

03:33.228 --> 03:34.528
I know, I know. (chuckles)

03:34.563 --> 03:36.563
Sorry, but this'll only take a moment.

03:36.615 --> 03:37.581
Something going on?

03:39.201 --> 03:40.294
No, look,

03:40.329 --> 03:42.519
I-I didn't want you to worry, okay? I...

03:42.554 --> 03:44.971
Uh, I had notice of a,

03:46.086 --> 03:47.240
of a convict's release.

03:47.292 --> 03:49.926
Some guy I put away when
I was with the DA's office.

03:49.962 --> 03:51.328
- Who?
- It doesn't matter.

03:51.363 --> 03:52.612
This happens all the time.

03:52.648 --> 03:54.865
I'm, baby, I'm just being careful, okay?

03:55.427 --> 03:56.967
I think we should know who's around.

03:57.019 --> 03:58.301
All these workers.

03:58.337 --> 03:59.464
Like last week when you invited

03:59.489 --> 04:01.188
that random landscaping guy
to the house.

04:01.223 --> 04:02.739
The one that you invited over?

04:03.595 --> 04:06.410
I-I-I'm just being careful, baby, okay?

04:06.462 --> 04:07.978
What...

04:08.030 --> 04:09.096
What is that?

04:09.131 --> 04:10.498
Centerpieces.

04:10.533 --> 04:11.982
It's Mom. She has a thing.

04:12.968 --> 04:14.134
I'll see you at the office.

04:14.169 --> 04:15.052
Okay.

04:17.389 --> 04:18.789
WINTERS: He's already here?

04:18.824 --> 04:20.923
You said we needed to talk to
him, so I called him to come in.

04:20.926 --> 04:23.026
From now on, you let me handle that.

04:23.028 --> 04:24.795
Terry Bausch isn't
some dime-bag corner boy.

04:24.830 --> 04:26.780
He has to be handled a certain way.

04:26.832 --> 04:29.466
Sorry, didn't realize
we offer VIP treatment.

04:30.652 --> 04:31.893
WINTERS: Ramon Baez,

04:32.304 --> 04:34.308
shot-caller for the
PB-7 gang, gunned down

04:34.333 --> 04:35.519
last month in Greenspoint.

04:35.906 --> 04:37.241
Street puts it on your crew.

04:37.293 --> 04:38.942
We spoke on this already.

04:38.944 --> 04:40.877
I mean, Baez wasn't exactly
my favorite person,

04:40.929 --> 04:42.095
but I don't know who took him out,

04:42.131 --> 04:43.396
and I know you're not accusing me of it.

04:43.432 --> 04:44.464
WINTERS: Here's what's new.

04:44.516 --> 04:46.616
Ballistics did a bullet comparison

04:46.652 --> 04:48.385
that says the firearm
that killed Ramon Baez

04:48.387 --> 04:51.455
also killed your boy, Darryl Williams.

04:51.941 --> 04:54.226
Shooter took out your enemy,
then he took out your friend.

04:54.693 --> 04:56.460
So you tell us who killed Ramon Baez,

04:56.495 --> 04:58.195
and they go down
for Darryl's murder, too.

04:58.197 --> 05:00.130
What about, uh, the friends
of the white boy

05:00.182 --> 05:01.748
who whooped up on Darryl
in the first place?

05:01.784 --> 05:03.100
Seems like that'd be
an intelligent place

05:03.152 --> 05:04.016
to look first, no?

05:04.051 --> 05:04.745
They've been cleared.

05:05.251 --> 05:06.640
Their alibis checked out.

05:07.306 --> 05:10.323
We found 90 grand cash
at Darryl's place.

05:11.310 --> 05:12.676
The killer didn't take it.

05:12.711 --> 05:14.277
The hit wasn't about money.

05:14.313 --> 05:15.492
It wasn't a gang move.

05:15.964 --> 05:18.157
It was personal.

05:19.429 --> 05:21.818
You know, the possibilities
are endless, Detective,

05:22.244 --> 05:23.470
but my time ain't.

05:25.159 --> 05:26.540
Have a nice day.

05:29.988 --> 05:31.178
(door opens)

05:31.230 --> 05:32.125
What now?

05:32.248 --> 05:33.613
Circle back on Darryl's girlfriend.

05:33.665 --> 05:34.782
See what stage of grief she's in.

05:35.234 --> 05:37.317
I don't think
she's telling us everything.

05:37.352 --> 05:40.270
My wife, Cece, and I have been
blessed with loving children

05:40.305 --> 05:41.605
and grandchildren.

05:41.640 --> 05:43.106
- (phone buzzing)
- And as your lieutenant governor,

05:43.142 --> 05:46.018
I have pushed to keep
traditional family values

05:46.070 --> 05:47.210
at the heart of...

05:48.013 --> 05:49.248
(sighs)

05:49.815 --> 05:52.132
I'm sorry, can-can we...

05:52.167 --> 05:53.650
cut, take five?

05:53.652 --> 05:54.885
I'm sorry.

05:54.887 --> 05:56.987
DIRECTOR: Cutting.
Let's take five, guys.

05:59.508 --> 06:01.143
On this Bobby Marks matter.

06:02.682 --> 06:03.506
Did you find him?

06:03.542 --> 06:04.756
No, quite the opposite.

06:05.164 --> 06:06.963
We put a trap on his credit cards,

06:06.965 --> 06:08.131
on his bank account.

06:08.167 --> 06:09.666
We put an APB on his vehicle.

06:09.701 --> 06:11.376
All came up nothing.

06:11.984 --> 06:13.246
This guy's gone silent.

06:14.273 --> 06:16.887
Yeah, right after he reminds me
how much he loves to talk.

06:17.576 --> 06:19.543
He's either running scared from me

06:19.545 --> 06:21.711
or his visitors returned
and helped him disappear.

06:21.914 --> 06:23.742
Now, who are these visitors, exactly?

06:23.767 --> 06:24.740
Don't worry about it.

06:25.257 --> 06:26.171
I'll handle them.

06:27.085 --> 06:29.152
Hey, there's my guy!

06:29.188 --> 06:30.619
Oh!

06:32.541 --> 06:34.958
Let's go out here and see
if we can make this work, huh?

06:35.010 --> 06:37.098
SHAWN: I'm saying
we lay low for a minute.

06:37.134 --> 06:39.412
Given what happened with Bobby,
we don't need that kind of heat

06:39.464 --> 06:41.162
- on us right now.
- The longer we take

06:41.214 --> 06:42.966
to track these bastards down,
the harder it's gonna be.

06:43.001 --> 06:44.317
Man, they're gonna scatter, Shawn.

06:44.369 --> 06:45.802
I want them just as much as you do.

06:45.854 --> 06:46.757
All right?

06:46.792 --> 06:47.946
They got pictures of me.

06:49.391 --> 06:50.790
♪ ♪

06:53.041 --> 06:54.010
Bobby said they'd

06:54.062 --> 06:56.079
take pictures at the warden's parties.

06:57.901 --> 06:59.237
What if he's still got them?

07:00.068 --> 07:01.096
Man, G.

07:01.520 --> 07:02.878
I didn't know that.

07:03.922 --> 07:05.655
You know, Red can give us
a better confession

07:05.691 --> 07:06.790
than Bobby could, anyway.

07:07.042 --> 07:08.158
The warden's wingman.

07:08.193 --> 07:09.593
He saw everything that happened.

07:09.645 --> 07:11.161
Yeah, but Amy said he disappeared.

07:11.213 --> 07:12.395
So we find him.

07:12.397 --> 07:13.797
Where to start?

07:13.799 --> 07:15.782
I mean, I'm figuring Red
wasn't his real first name.

07:15.817 --> 07:16.573
Gerald.

07:18.190 --> 07:19.486
Gerald?

07:19.538 --> 07:20.820
I heard the warden call him that.

07:21.408 --> 07:22.372
Here you go.

07:22.374 --> 07:23.373
I want in.

07:23.615 --> 07:24.808
If you guys are moving forward

07:24.860 --> 07:26.280
with this plan
and putting yourselves at risk,

07:26.305 --> 07:28.311
- then I want to help.
- No, that's not happening.

07:28.313 --> 07:30.413
- Why not?
- Because it's not your fight, baby.

07:30.415 --> 07:32.182
I don't want you involved.

07:32.217 --> 07:33.750
Well, I've always been involved.

07:33.752 --> 07:35.452
The only reason you guys got
sent away in the first place

07:35.487 --> 07:37.068
was because of me,
so let me pay that back.

07:37.103 --> 07:38.505
- Stop-stop it! It's not happening.
- ‭Why not?

07:38.540 --> 07:39.739
Forget it! It's not happening.

07:39.775 --> 07:41.474
I don't want to have
this conversation right now.

07:41.510 --> 07:43.893
(sighs)

07:44.501 --> 07:45.933
Come here. I-I'm sorry.

07:48.309 --> 07:49.516
I'm sorry.

07:50.764 --> 07:51.935
G, look.

07:54.706 --> 07:55.772
Gerald "Red" Tyson.

07:58.293 --> 08:00.143
JESSIE: Jackson!

08:00.178 --> 08:01.544
Stop!

08:04.516 --> 08:06.049
That's who you're looking for?

08:06.084 --> 08:09.953
Yeah. That's the other guard
at Quitman I told you about.

08:10.281 --> 08:12.922
SHAWN: Says he walked off
shift at Quitman back in '98.

08:12.924 --> 08:14.307
Nobody's seen him since.

08:14.343 --> 08:15.392
Amy was right.

08:15.394 --> 08:17.043
Evil he did at that place,

08:17.876 --> 08:19.229
maybe he went underground.

08:20.173 --> 08:22.549
Got scared his past
would come back to haunt him.

08:23.309 --> 08:25.735
I think today's that day.

Hey. ‭What are you, uh,
what are you doing here?

08:44.455 --> 08:45.864
I tried calling you all morning.

08:45.866 --> 08:47.416
So, I'm sorry, I had no choice.

08:47.418 --> 08:48.667
What-What's wrong?

08:48.669 --> 08:50.252
Gil and Shawn aren't stopping.

08:50.254 --> 08:51.286
You need to talk to them.

08:51.288 --> 08:53.553
No, I told, I told them I'm out.

08:54.041 --> 08:56.054
I've already got a target on my back.

08:56.261 --> 08:57.594
What do you mean you have
a target on your back?

08:57.596 --> 08:58.929
Just tell them to drop it.

08:58.931 --> 09:00.681

09:00.683 --> 09:02.251

09:02.601 --> 09:04.434
They're going after Red Tyson.

09:08.273 --> 09:09.649
Hey.

09:10.109 --> 09:12.409
Okay, they already
started looking for him.

09:12.411 --> 09:14.611
What if they stir up something
about what we did to him?

09:14.613 --> 09:16.613
They won't, they won't.

09:16.615 --> 09:17.948
You don't have to worry about that,

09:17.950 --> 09:20.033
but you tell Gil and Shawn
if they want to stay safe,

09:20.035 --> 09:22.002
they need to forget about revenge.

09:22.004 --> 09:23.787

10:12.284 --> 10:14.834
all the way from Brennan
to see some friends.

10:15.220 --> 10:16.260
Yes, sir.

10:16.755 --> 10:18.372
Do your parents know you're here?

10:20.592 --> 10:22.709
Well, you are one resourceful
little girl.

10:23.021 --> 10:25.629
Those Brennan boys are lucky
to have a friend like you.

10:25.631 --> 10:27.148
Thanks.

10:27.683 --> 10:29.309
Let me tell you something.

10:30.302 --> 10:33.103
Having a visitor might be, uh,
rough on your friends.

10:34.486 --> 10:37.474
You know, boys have a sort of funny
sense of pride,

10:37.476 --> 10:39.776
and then being seen in a place like this

10:39.778 --> 10:41.228
can make them a little, uh,

10:41.230 --> 10:42.669
a little ashamed.

10:43.772 --> 10:46.316
And sometimes getting a glimpse of home,

10:46.318 --> 10:48.868
especially a pretty one like you,

10:48.870 --> 10:50.453
well, that makes their time here

10:50.455 --> 10:51.493
that much worse.

10:54.876 --> 10:57.043
Now, I'm happy to escort you
to see them,

10:57.045 --> 10:58.358
if you want.

11:05.197 --> 11:06.085
No?

11:07.240 --> 11:08.622
All right, well, that's okay, too.

11:09.572 --> 11:11.758
I'll make sure to tell them
you stopped by.

11:19.868 --> 11:21.617

11:40.372 --> 11:41.417
Done.

11:48.297 --> 11:49.083
What the hell, T?

11:49.931 --> 11:51.268
Well, with Darryl no longer with us,

11:51.270 --> 11:53.250
somebody's got to step up
and take his spot.

11:53.252 --> 11:54.875
Yeah, that was supposed to be me,

11:54.877 --> 11:55.908
not Marco.

11:55.910 --> 11:57.762
I've been hustling for you
since the Quitman days.

11:57.764 --> 11:59.889
I've done everything
that you have asked me to do.

11:59.891 --> 12:00.862
A few weeks back,

12:00.864 --> 12:02.109
when I needed Ramon Baez put down...

12:02.111 --> 12:03.651
Yeah, I was the one that blasted him,

12:03.978 --> 12:05.195
like I said I would.

12:05.197 --> 12:06.904
I didn't think twice about it.

12:12.487 --> 12:13.488
I hear you.

12:15.505 --> 12:17.057
You wanted Darryl's spot.

12:19.080 --> 12:20.456
You put in your time.

12:30.922 --> 12:32.375
You'll get what's coming to you.

12:35.428 --> 12:36.593
Did you find the guy or not, man?

12:36.595 --> 12:38.705
G, my homie's doing us a favor.

12:39.598 --> 12:40.764

12:43.185 --> 12:45.736
DMV, no tax records.

12:46.096 --> 12:47.653
He's got no surviving family,

12:47.656 --> 12:49.940
so all of my skip-tracing tricks,

12:49.942 --> 12:51.525
they turned up nada.

12:51.527 --> 12:53.110
No, no, no, no, that's not good enough.

12:53.112 --> 12:55.029
I know you can find something.
That's what you do, right?

12:55.031 --> 12:56.113

works at a church now?

13:45.923 --> 13:47.289
So you're still catching up with Dennis.

13:47.325 --> 13:48.374
That's nice.

13:48.865 --> 13:50.754
And his brother, Terry, too, I bet.

13:51.898 --> 13:54.630

13:59.053 --> 14:00.321
What are you doing here?

14:00.821 --> 14:03.472
Well, I understand that, uh, you
and a couple of Quitman friends

14:03.474 --> 14:05.576
paid a visit to Bobby Marks
a few days ago.

14:05.611 --> 14:07.493
You know, you get Bobby talking
on something,

14:07.528 --> 14:09.545
there's no telling
the fishtails he'll spin.

14:09.580 --> 14:11.547
I bet he told you some whoppers.

14:12.200 --> 14:13.616
But the thing is,

14:13.618 --> 14:15.601
I'd like to speak to Bobby myself,

14:15.653 --> 14:16.769
but I can find him,

14:16.794 --> 14:18.888
so I thought maybe you'd be able
to help me on that.

14:18.923 --> 14:19.972
Well, I don't know

14:20.007 --> 14:20.708
where Bobby is.

14:22.076 --> 14:23.759
I bet that's not entirely true.

14:24.323 --> 14:25.377
Tell you the truth,

14:25.413 --> 14:26.204
I don't really care,

14:26.747 --> 14:27.863
'cause he told us everything

14:27.899 --> 14:29.822
we needed to know about Quitman and you.

14:30.518 --> 14:31.837
And we got that on tape.

14:33.371 --> 14:34.846
You know you're not like them.

14:36.591 --> 14:39.458
You were always the smart one
of those Brennan kids.

a life like this

14:43.147 --> 14:44.546
if you didn't let them drag you down.

14:44.582 --> 14:46.166
So be smart, Jackson.

14:47.125 --> 14:48.773
I told you not to kick this rock.

14:51.275 --> 14:54.293
I'm not that kid you used to
push around in Quitman anymore.

14:55.843 --> 14:56.860
You don't scare me.

14:56.912 --> 14:58.614
Oh, but I think I do, Jackie.

Oh. (chuckles)

19:19.901 --> 19:20.534
Hey.

19:20.587 --> 19:21.923
- Hi.
- ‭What's...

19:21.975 --> 19:23.721
Hi! Hey.

19:23.723 --> 19:26.290
So, you a friend of Jackson's?

19:26.292 --> 19:27.959
No, I'm his fiancée.

19:27.994 --> 19:29.393
Fiancée?

19:29.445 --> 19:31.445
Oh, right! Right!

19:31.481 --> 19:33.164
- I'm sorry, I don't think we've met.
- All kinds of right.

19:33.166 --> 19:34.365
What was your name?

19:34.367 --> 19:35.700
I'm thirsty.

19:35.735 --> 19:37.068
Excuse me?

19:37.854 --> 19:38.836
Excuse me?

19:38.838 --> 19:40.655
(Gil muttering)

19:42.442 --> 19:43.774
He's taller than you are.

19:43.810 --> 19:45.471
- Hey. How are you?
- Hey.

19:45.523 --> 19:47.864
- Jackie, nice tent, man!
- ‭Thank you.

19:47.889 --> 19:49.931
I must have missed
my invitation. I don't know.

19:49.983 --> 19:51.349
Look at all these friends you have.

19:51.384 --> 19:52.617
How many girls are named Buffy?

19:52.652 --> 19:53.834
(chuckles) Okay.

19:53.870 --> 19:55.082
You can't be here, bro.

19:55.134 --> 19:56.475
No, no, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

19:56.527 --> 19:58.089
I just, I only came by for a second.

19:58.091 --> 19:59.824
I just want to tell you
something really quickly.

19:59.876 --> 20:01.025
Just gonna take a second.

20:01.027 --> 20:03.894
I just, I want to let you know that...

20:05.632 --> 20:07.171
We-we don't, we don't need you.

20:08.739 --> 20:10.101
Thank you.

20:10.136 --> 20:11.869
I'm gonna walk you out.

20:11.871 --> 20:12.870
(muttering) Okay, come here, come on.

20:12.905 --> 20:13.988
Just talk, let's talk outside.

20:14.023 --> 20:14.776
I ain't talking.

20:14.801 --> 20:15.789
You're drunk, I'm gonna walk you out.

20:15.814 --> 20:17.051
Get your hands off me!

20:18.461 --> 20:19.827
What's the matter with you?

20:19.862 --> 20:20.695
Okay, okay.

20:20.730 --> 20:21.712
Let's just talk outside.

20:21.748 --> 20:22.547
Let me, let me, hang on a second.

20:22.572 --> 20:23.633
You afraid I might tell these people

20:23.685 --> 20:24.660
something you don't want them to know?

20:24.685 --> 20:25.740
Don't do this.

20:25.765 --> 20:27.692
- Hey, everybody, listen up!
- Don't do it.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.603
My name's Gil.

20:29.639 --> 20:30.838
The reason you don't know me,

20:30.873 --> 20:32.206
though, is because Jackie here...

20:40.167 --> 20:41.143
Here.

20:43.758 --> 20:44.512
Sorry.

20:45.543 --> 20:46.659
You ruined the finish.

20:46.694 --> 20:48.310
Jessie's on her way.

20:48.346 --> 20:49.397
All right.

20:53.555 --> 20:55.525
We gave it our best shot, Jackie.

20:56.070 --> 20:57.269
Didn't work out.

20:57.271 --> 20:58.921
Gil, you don't have to talk about it.

20:58.973 --> 21:00.139
No, listen.

21:00.174 --> 21:01.174
It's cool, man.

21:01.776 --> 21:03.959
You have your life, I have mine.

21:05.399 --> 21:06.615
It's crazy to think we could...

21:07.503 --> 21:09.215
pick up after 25 years

21:09.250 --> 21:10.583
right where we left off.

21:16.146 --> 21:18.546
We don't have to pretend like
we're still brothers anymore.

21:20.378 --> 21:22.394
It's okay. I'm cool with it, I am.

21:23.414 --> 21:25.065
Hey. ‭Hey.

21:26.210 --> 21:27.529
I'll wait for you in the car. ‭Yeah.

21:29.337 --> 21:31.537
If he broke anything, just let
me know what it costs, and...

21:31.572 --> 21:32.638
Oh, Jessie, come on. Please.

21:32.690 --> 21:33.690
No, enjoy your party.

21:36.978 --> 21:38.761
In case he forgot to mention,

21:38.796 --> 21:40.329
Annie had her baby.

21:40.381 --> 21:41.937
What did she have, boy or girl?

21:42.230 --> 21:43.077
Boy.

21:43.102 --> 21:44.588
Boy. ‭Gary Jr.

21:45.286 --> 21:46.542
(laughs)

21:47.622 --> 21:48.671
Boots has a son.

21:48.723 --> 21:51.040
That's... that's awesome.

21:51.075 --> 21:52.514
Yeah. (chuckles)

21:52.593 --> 21:53.627
Big healthy boy.

21:53.967 --> 21:55.900
Eyes like her dad, she said, so...

21:56.197 --> 21:58.514
We're gonna head up tomorrow
and visit them.

21:58.549 --> 22:00.542
Just want to let you know,
in case you want to,

22:00.544 --> 22:04.219
you know, mail a card or whatever.

22:04.255 --> 22:06.238
Take care.

22:08.555 --> 22:09.445
(door closes)

22:10.550 --> 22:12.035
Are you coming back to the party?

22:14.048 --> 22:15.531
Yeah.

22:31.024 --> 22:32.512
I already made coffee.

22:34.335 --> 22:35.192
Thank you.

22:42.193 --> 22:43.760
I want you to tell me everything.

22:45.175 --> 22:46.412
What exactly do you want me...

22:46.447 --> 22:47.446
All of it.

22:49.180 --> 22:51.113
You have been distracted all week,

22:51.452 --> 22:53.097
here and at the office.

22:53.604 --> 22:55.483
You disappear for hours.

22:56.100 --> 22:59.400
You missed the drinks
with my parents, and I saw you

22:59.623 --> 23:01.022
arguing with your friend Jessie.

23:01.495 --> 23:02.356
You were there?

23:03.180 --> 23:04.296
And then this

23:04.298 --> 23:07.599
stranger crashes our party,
you punch him,

23:07.601 --> 23:09.969
and Jessie's the one who picks him up.

23:10.004 --> 23:12.438
And I know that you're saying
there's nothing to worry about,

23:12.490 --> 23:13.639
that you're handling it,

23:13.674 --> 23:15.207
but I don't want to be handled.

23:15.789 --> 23:18.031
I want you to tell me
what's happening to our life.

23:22.900 --> 23:24.457
They were my friends.

23:28.439 --> 23:30.264
Remember that client I had,

23:30.791 --> 23:31.939
Gary Nolan?

23:34.845 --> 23:37.112
We were friends as kids down in Brennan,

23:37.148 --> 23:38.423
and I hadn't...

23:38.883 --> 23:40.695
hadn't seen him for years.

23:42.479 --> 23:44.837
He was killed in jail.

23:47.541 --> 23:49.334
I went to his funeral, and, uh...

23:51.662 --> 23:54.335
...there were a few other
friends from my childhood there.

23:56.834 --> 23:57.920
Boots'...

23:58.886 --> 24:00.999
Gary's death... it just, it just sh...

24:01.872 --> 24:03.555
shook everyone up a little.

24:03.591 --> 24:05.596
So I've been spending
some time with them,

24:05.910 --> 24:06.532
just...

24:08.729 --> 24:10.509
just to help them
get through it, you know?

24:11.749 --> 24:15.267
We've been out of touch for so long.

24:15.747 --> 24:17.739
We were all best friends.

24:19.223 --> 24:22.800
Jessie, Gil from last night,

24:22.802 --> 24:24.007
and, uh...

24:25.219 --> 24:26.537
there's another one, Shawn.

24:27.824 --> 24:31.085
Why wouldn't you tell me any of this?

24:32.153 --> 24:34.420
I could've helped you through it.

24:34.422 --> 24:35.587
'Cause I didn't know

24:35.623 --> 24:36.814
what was going on, baby.

24:36.849 --> 24:39.042
I didn't know if they were
gonna be in our lives.

24:39.449 --> 24:41.366
I didn't know if I was
just helping them out

24:41.391 --> 24:44.463
in a tough time, you know? And...

24:46.229 --> 24:49.080
Turns out, that's exactly what happened.

24:49.105 --> 24:52.123
I tried, and it didn't work,
so it's over.

24:57.043 --> 24:58.511
And that's everything?

25:02.032 --> 25:03.565
That's everything.

25:11.092 --> 25:12.857
They were your best friends.

25:14.496 --> 25:15.828
They were.

25:29.990 --> 25:31.100
(sighs)

25:34.899 --> 25:36.415
(whispering): I'm sorry.

25:39.603 --> 25:41.643
SHAWN: Annie, got the
bouncer chair set up

25:41.676 --> 25:43.768
and enough diapers to last little Boots

25:43.820 --> 25:45.189
till senior prom.

25:45.731 --> 25:46.880
(baby fussing)

25:46.932 --> 25:49.682
This isn't how it was supposed to be.

25:51.088 --> 25:52.135
Yeah, I know.

25:53.688 --> 25:54.904
I'm alone.

25:55.507 --> 25:57.240
Hey. ‭(sighs)

25:57.615 --> 25:58.775
Your folks will be here tonight.

25:58.811 --> 25:59.960
And your neighbor

25:59.995 --> 26:01.244
who drove you to the hospital.

26:01.297 --> 26:02.863
- Lorna?
- ‭Right, Lorna.

26:02.898 --> 26:05.782
Next door. I mean, she seemed nice.

26:05.807 --> 26:07.233
Old as hell, but hey.

26:07.269 --> 26:08.327
(laughing)

26:08.662 --> 26:10.262
Like, really old, but that's okay.

26:10.297 --> 26:11.880
You can hang out with old people.

26:11.914 --> 26:14.014
She has diapers,
he has diapers... it's fun.

26:14.066 --> 26:15.049
(sniffles)

26:18.070 --> 26:19.503
Sorry I'm the only one here.

26:19.555 --> 26:21.376
That's not what I meant.

26:28.965 --> 26:31.732
Annie, I'm gonna do everything I can

26:31.784 --> 26:33.539
to make this right as can be.

26:34.337 --> 26:35.769
- (knocking)
- Thank you.

26:35.821 --> 26:36.881
I'll get it.

26:37.757 --> 26:39.740
(sighs)

26:39.775 --> 26:41.425
Hey, I'm glad y'all came.

26:41.427 --> 26:42.775
JESSIE: Yeah. Is she doing good?

26:42.810 --> 26:44.728
- Yeah, yeah. She'll be happy to see you.
- ‭Okay.

26:44.730 --> 26:45.896
Hi. (chuckles)

26:45.932 --> 26:47.698
That one's for the baby, that's for me.

26:47.733 --> 26:49.469
I got plenty of nipples for that bottle.

26:49.936 --> 26:50.851
Hi.

26:50.886 --> 26:52.202
(sighs): Oh.

26:52.204 --> 26:54.471
Oh, my God, let me see him.

26:54.523 --> 26:55.956
I know. Let me see this guy.

26:56.008 --> 26:57.541
(laughs) ‭Okay.

26:57.577 --> 26:59.026
Oh, my God.

26:59.061 --> 27:00.661
Annie, he's gorgeous.

27:00.696 --> 27:02.446
Come on, look at this little face.

27:02.481 --> 27:04.381
Hi. Hi, buddy.

27:04.383 --> 27:05.382
ANNIE: I know.

27:05.418 --> 27:06.867
(laughter)

27:13.126 --> 27:14.280
WINTERS: Hey, Mariah.

27:16.078 --> 27:17.703
You holding up okay?

27:18.998 --> 27:20.854
They give your boyfriend a nice service?

27:21.968 --> 27:23.751
Darryl's family's cheap.

27:24.311 --> 27:25.319
Well, there's nothing cheap

27:25.354 --> 27:27.223
about that piece around your neck.

27:28.174 --> 27:29.711
Wow, it's beautiful.

27:30.276 --> 27:31.475
Did Darryl buy that for you?

27:31.510 --> 27:32.876
We know he had some serious cash

27:32.912 --> 27:34.009
when he died.

27:34.480 --> 27:35.649
He didn't spend it on me.

27:36.065 --> 27:37.114
So who did?

27:37.149 --> 27:38.816
Spend on you?

27:38.851 --> 27:40.718
Why's Five-O care about my love life?

27:40.753 --> 27:42.319
'Cause it's looking like
Darryl was killed

27:42.371 --> 27:43.887
by someone in his own gang.

27:45.169 --> 27:46.624
And there's one thing that comes to mind

27:46.659 --> 27:48.713
that would make a man
go after his friend like that.

27:50.137 --> 27:51.695
A woman like you.

27:56.068 --> 27:59.003
So is your new man
someone from Darryl's gang?

28:01.273 --> 28:02.189
Who is he?

28:02.224 --> 28:04.054
Darryl was never gonna let me go.

28:04.056 --> 28:05.643
I-I didn't want him killed.

28:05.678 --> 28:06.811
I didn't ask for that.

28:06.846 --> 28:09.163
Tell me who the other guy is,
and I'll keep you out of it.

28:09.618 --> 28:10.939
I love him.

28:11.350 --> 28:13.100
It's just as easy
for me to take your phone

28:13.135 --> 28:14.251
and get the name from there.

28:14.937 --> 28:16.226
Then I have to keep the phone.

28:16.922 --> 28:18.438
Evidence.

28:21.911 --> 28:23.790
His name's Marco.

28:26.499 --> 28:27.648
Jackson knocked you out

28:27.683 --> 28:29.650
in front of all those people
at the party?

28:29.685 --> 28:31.001
- Knocked me out.
- ‭What?! (laughs)

28:31.037 --> 28:32.603
It might as well have been
Tyson-Douglas.

28:32.605 --> 28:33.937
Man, I'm crawling around the canvas,

28:33.973 --> 28:34.905
looking for my mouthpiece.

28:34.940 --> 28:36.740
Yo, that's epic, man.

28:36.776 --> 28:38.642
- Yeah, something.
- (sighs)

28:39.679 --> 28:41.695
All right, here it is.

28:41.731 --> 28:43.964
Boots' homemade movies
from back in the day.

28:43.999 --> 28:45.579
You know, um...

28:46.435 --> 28:48.419
Hey, you sure this
is the best idea right now?

28:48.421 --> 28:50.688
Yeah. Baby Boots needs to see his daddy.

28:50.740 --> 28:52.756
- (knocking)
- ‭Come in.

28:53.826 --> 28:55.976
Jackie, you made it.

28:56.011 --> 28:57.995
Yeah, well, we decided why not.

28:57.997 --> 29:00.064
Hi. I'm Marina.

29:02.702 --> 29:05.069
Jackson's told me all about you guys.

29:05.104 --> 29:06.420
You must be Annie.

29:06.472 --> 29:07.774
- Yeah.
- ‭Congratulations...

29:07.799 --> 29:09.625
- Yeah, thank you.
- ...on your baby boy.

29:09.925 --> 29:11.208
Jessie, it's good to see you again.

29:11.210 --> 29:13.077
Yeah, you, too. Hi.

29:13.112 --> 29:15.841
And just to clear the air,
Jackson did inform me of

29:15.843 --> 29:17.815
- your seventh-grade courtship.
- Ah. (chuckles)

29:19.051 --> 29:21.441
I have been warned
how charming you can be.

29:21.477 --> 29:22.412
- Oh, it's legendary.
- ‭Mm.

29:22.437 --> 29:24.388
But I'm gonna keep it under control.

29:24.423 --> 29:26.106
MARINA: Gil, I didn't realize

29:26.142 --> 29:27.558
I was meeting ‭the Gil Harris yesterday.

29:27.610 --> 29:28.609
Jackson told me

29:28.644 --> 29:30.694
what an amazing friend you always were.

29:30.696 --> 29:32.846
I'm really sorry I ruined
your party last night.

29:32.882 --> 29:36.016
Uh, we don't usually assault
our guests. (chuckles)

29:36.068 --> 29:37.601
At least not physically.

29:37.636 --> 29:38.869
Want to hold him?

29:38.871 --> 29:41.105
JACKSON (chuckles):
Yeah. That'd be great.

29:43.576 --> 29:44.808
Oh, look at you.

29:44.844 --> 29:46.477
You got it. You can do it.

29:46.512 --> 29:48.612
Look at you, you drowsy little guy.

29:48.614 --> 29:50.848
Good, good.

29:50.883 --> 29:53.367
(both laugh)

29:53.402 --> 29:55.119
Baby, look at this.

29:56.824 --> 29:58.807
This is little Boots.

29:58.858 --> 30:00.256
MARINA: So sweet.

30:01.207 --> 30:02.773
- Little Boots.
- ‭So sweet.

30:06.198 --> 30:08.148
(crickets chirping)

30:24.096 --> 30:26.016
You have something
you want to talk about, T?

30:26.783 --> 30:27.999
Yeah.

30:28.754 --> 30:29.695
Eddie.

30:31.423 --> 30:32.886
We got a problem.

30:34.160 --> 30:35.085
We do?

30:36.295 --> 30:38.345
Now, you go back a long
minute with someone,

30:38.380 --> 30:39.462
you think you know them.

30:40.549 --> 30:42.750
Kind of dirt they do, what they won't.

30:43.686 --> 30:44.750
And you trust that.

30:45.087 --> 30:47.454
(chuckles) Make money off that.

30:48.235 --> 30:50.078
Problem occurs when...

30:50.826 --> 30:51.983
they surprise you.

30:52.478 --> 30:54.582
Everything you trusted

30:55.998 --> 30:57.564
turns out to be a lie.

31:01.209 --> 31:03.188
This is about the Ramon Baez hit.

31:06.458 --> 31:07.734
All right, T.

31:08.727 --> 31:09.790
I'm sorry.

31:10.312 --> 31:11.551
You're sorry?

31:12.131 --> 31:13.575
For lying to you.

31:14.133 --> 31:16.479
For telling you that I was
the one that blasted Baez.

31:17.403 --> 31:18.879
You didn't do that hit?

31:19.738 --> 31:20.999
Nah, man.

31:21.774 --> 31:23.083
That was all Marco.

31:24.276 --> 31:27.456
I mean, I would've done it,
but, man, he beat me to it.

31:29.882 --> 31:31.782
I-I only said that because

31:32.879 --> 31:35.085
I-I didn't want him to come up over me.

31:38.107 --> 31:39.159
(laughs)

31:42.661 --> 31:44.494
Look, good meat takes time to cook.

31:44.547 --> 31:45.913
Yeah, right. ‭That's the way it is.

31:45.948 --> 31:47.531
Jackie, I got a cold one for you.

31:47.566 --> 31:48.749
Grouchy. Thanks, brother.

31:48.801 --> 31:50.117
(laughs)

31:50.152 --> 31:52.402
I think my fiancée's gonna
give up her law career

31:52.438 --> 31:53.453
to be that kid's nanny.

31:53.505 --> 31:54.838
Man, you got a good one, Jackson.

31:54.874 --> 31:56.840
Yeah, I know.
It's better than I deserve.

32:00.312 --> 32:02.246
You need to forget about Red Tyson.

32:02.798 --> 32:04.281
You won't find him.

32:06.802 --> 32:07.901
Listen, I know

32:07.953 --> 32:09.186
you made it clear you don't want to...

32:09.188 --> 32:10.703
You won't find him because I killed him.

32:11.173 --> 32:12.856
What?

32:12.908 --> 32:14.641
18 years ago.

32:16.378 --> 32:17.578
SHAWN: What? Wait, wait.

32:17.613 --> 32:18.679
What-what are you talking about?

32:18.731 --> 32:21.071
I went back to Quitman one night, alone.

32:21.867 --> 32:23.236
I wanted to...

32:23.568 --> 32:24.854
see the place.

32:25.588 --> 32:26.747
Red was there.

32:27.219 --> 32:28.452
I shot him and I buried him.

32:28.724 --> 32:29.690
You won't find him.

32:29.725 --> 32:30.624
Jackie, wait.

32:30.659 --> 32:32.392
Jackie, wait, wait, wait.

32:32.428 --> 32:33.710
Hang on a second.

32:33.746 --> 32:35.174
How come you never said anything
about this to us?

32:35.209 --> 32:35.985
How come?

32:36.859 --> 32:38.293
'Cause I was running from it.

32:39.746 --> 32:40.651
I can't.

32:40.686 --> 32:42.552
The warden knows what I did.

32:43.243 --> 32:44.038
And he made that very clear

32:44.073 --> 32:45.389
when he came to my office

32:45.441 --> 32:46.443
- yesterday.
- ‭Whoa, whoa.

32:46.926 --> 32:48.492
What do you mean,
he came to your office?

32:48.527 --> 32:49.506
JACKSON: He threatened me.

32:50.811 --> 32:52.446
Said we wake any more ghosts

32:52.481 --> 32:53.721
from Quitman,

32:53.757 --> 32:55.138
it all comes out.

32:55.517 --> 32:57.284
So that's it.

32:57.319 --> 32:58.819
We're out. We're done.

32:58.854 --> 33:00.590
We ain't letting you go down for murder.

33:01.040 --> 33:03.557
Nothing's worth any of us
gettin' locked up again.

33:03.609 --> 33:05.042
GIL: You telling me

33:05.094 --> 33:07.060
you've been hauling this
secret around for 18 years?

33:07.807 --> 33:09.714
Never said anything to anybody?

33:09.748 --> 33:10.747
That's right.

33:14.420 --> 33:16.403
You don't believe me, Gil?

33:21.744 --> 33:22.935
No, I do.

33:24.113 --> 33:25.553
Shawn's right, it's over.

33:38.110 --> 33:39.598
Why did you do that?

33:39.979 --> 33:42.195
Why did you lie about
what really happened to Red?

33:42.247 --> 33:43.641
To protect you.

33:53.342 --> 33:55.459
No one else knows
what happened that night.

33:55.511 --> 33:56.893
I'm gonna keep it that way.

33:59.331 --> 34:00.638
- Here.
- ‭Thank you.

34:01.462 --> 34:02.215
The guilt I've felt

34:03.298 --> 34:05.236
over you guys going
to Quitman because of me...

34:05.237 --> 34:06.720
I owe it to you to help.

34:06.772 --> 34:07.731
Jessie...

34:08.063 --> 34:09.973
you don't owe me anything.

34:12.795 --> 34:14.244
You saved my life.

34:17.422 --> 34:19.072
I don't want to see you get hurt.

34:24.639 --> 34:26.005
JACKSON: We gotta get rid of the body.

34:26.041 --> 34:27.157
JESSIE: Okay.

34:27.159 --> 34:28.942
Jackson. Jackson!

34:31.063 --> 34:32.396
JACKSON: We gotta get rid of the body!

34:32.398 --> 34:33.530
JESSIE: Jackson...

34:33.565 --> 34:34.514
Okay.

34:34.550 --> 34:36.565
(panting)

34:42.074 --> 34:43.172
Where's the body?

34:44.743 --> 34:45.992
- Where's the body?
- I can't see, I don't know.

34:46.027 --> 34:47.143
Jackson!

34:48.213 --> 34:50.197
(grunting)

34:56.355 --> 34:58.005
(gunshot)

35:13.846 --> 35:15.580
- Let's bowl!
- ‭(laughter) ‭This were we used to go.

35:19.927 --> 35:21.393

...you're about to see
the great Gary "Boots" Nolan

35:23.619 --> 35:27.682
of Brennan, Texas, demonstrate
his world-famous bowling skills.

35:27.717 --> 35:29.667
Who couldn't love him?

SHAWN: Baby Boots!

L-Listen, we need to get
baby Boots some baby boots.

35:44.951 --> 35:45.967

wait, wait, wait, wait.

35:48.822 --> 35:50.104
Check it out.

35:50.140 --> 35:52.090
Nobody's ever gonna forget your daddy.

Hang on. What?

35:56.096 --> 35:57.411
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

35:57.464 --> 35:58.729
No, no, no, no, no...
Wait, wait,

The band!

36:03.736 --> 36:05.052
- You had a band?
- ‭Yo.

36:05.088 --> 36:07.071
Yeah, we had a band. Yes, we had a band.

36:07.073 --> 36:08.689
What?

36:08.725 --> 36:10.541
Are you playing a microwave?

36:10.593 --> 36:11.909
Whoa, I'm dominating.

36:11.945 --> 36:13.892
SHAWN: Right now, go play
the microwave right now.

36:13.917 --> 36:16.364

‭- I still got it!

36:21.937 --> 36:24.009
- Annie, honey, what's wrong?
- Oh, my God, Shawn.

36:24.034 --> 36:25.928
- Annie, Annie, what's wrong?
- Guys... Shawn!

36:25.953 --> 36:27.385
Guys! Guys!

36:27.927 --> 36:29.043
Uh, um...

36:29.095 --> 36:30.895
that was the sheriff's department.

36:30.930 --> 36:33.831
A man in jail confessed
to stabbing Boots.

36:33.833 --> 36:35.133
SHAWN: What? Who?

36:35.168 --> 36:37.372
(crying): Um... some, some man

36:37.397 --> 36:39.904
who was going away
to serve a life sentence.

36:39.940 --> 36:42.623
And he said that Boots
started a fight with him,

36:42.659 --> 36:45.193
and so he killed him.

36:45.228 --> 36:46.477
- (Annie sobbing)
- JESSIE: Are you okay?

36:46.513 --> 36:48.246
Okay, okay, okay. Come here, come here.

36:48.248 --> 36:49.647
- Come here.
- GIL: Shawn. Shawn.

36:49.699 --> 36:50.648
I've got you.

36:50.683 --> 36:52.421
Shawn...

36:52.456 --> 36:54.629
He should've never been locked
in the same cell with a lifer.

36:55.223 --> 36:56.585
He would still be alive!

36:56.851 --> 36:58.114
He could hold his son!

36:59.118 --> 37:01.351
Annie wouldn't have to go
through all this madness.

37:02.485 --> 37:03.821
Come on, man.

37:03.857 --> 37:05.640
It's... it's just...

37:06.273 --> 37:07.709
it's just... it ain't right.

37:07.710 --> 37:10.111
GIL: There's no way Boots would
go after some random convict.

37:10.146 --> 37:11.096
That can't be what happened.

37:11.464 --> 37:12.914
We all know how it works
in places like that.

37:12.966 --> 37:14.765
All-all they want to do
is close the case.

37:14.801 --> 37:15.766
That's it.

37:15.802 --> 37:16.884
So they find

37:16.920 --> 37:18.402
some dude who's doing life already,

37:18.454 --> 37:19.512
he catches the rap...

37:22.909 --> 37:23.948
The whole thing

37:24.894 --> 37:26.143
is rotten.

37:26.830 --> 37:28.201
Right? Tell me I'm wrong.

37:29.225 --> 37:30.998
So let's make it right.

37:34.521 --> 37:35.528
How?

37:36.356 --> 37:39.112
Those kids in that video back there...

37:39.726 --> 37:41.960
we were fearless.

37:43.029 --> 37:44.545
Brothers, right?

37:46.937 --> 37:48.402
What are you saying?

37:49.836 --> 37:51.089
I'm saying the plan's back on.

37:51.114 --> 37:53.159
I say we take the warden down,
every son of a bitch

37:53.194 --> 37:55.025
that hurt us, that hurt Boots.

37:55.027 --> 37:56.438
We don't stop till it's done.

37:56.643 --> 37:57.959
SHAWN: The warden...

37:58.294 --> 38:00.161
What he knows about you and Red.

38:00.196 --> 38:01.929
We got plenty of ammo, Shawn,

38:01.981 --> 38:03.699
and all the things
he did to us at Quitman?

38:04.083 --> 38:05.325
I'll tell you this:

38:05.446 --> 38:06.741
Terry Bausch...

38:07.130 --> 38:09.447
he delivered a threat to my house.

38:10.587 --> 38:13.333
He's still working
as the warden's attack dog.

38:13.726 --> 38:15.482
Wait a minute.
The warden's hooked up with a...

38:15.518 --> 38:16.953
- with a d boy?
- ‭That's right.

38:16.978 --> 38:19.113
Yeah, his crimes are not
all in the past.

38:19.148 --> 38:21.760
So he's just as vulnerable as us.

38:21.785 --> 38:23.867
If we attack the right way,
we've got him.

38:23.919 --> 38:25.469
We gotta be smart, Gil,
we gotta be smart.

38:25.505 --> 38:26.560
He's gonna be watching.

38:26.585 --> 38:28.501
We're gonna make every
single one of them pay, then.

38:28.537 --> 38:29.395
Damn right.

38:30.634 --> 38:31.743
All in.

38:33.930 --> 38:35.179
All in.

38:35.214 --> 38:36.197
All right.

38:42.872 --> 38:44.302
Marco Ladera?

38:45.208 --> 38:48.059
HPD. We need to talk.

39:00.573 --> 39:02.924
MARCO: Please, T,
do not do this, man, please...

39:02.959 --> 39:04.292
We're friends, man. We're friends, okay?

39:04.327 --> 39:06.260
It's not even my gun, okay?

39:06.262 --> 39:08.746
Eddie-Eddie-Eddie-Eddie-Eddie...

39:08.781 --> 39:10.197
Oh, God, please.

39:10.233 --> 39:12.083
(sobbing)

39:13.036 --> 39:15.970
Please, T, you do not want to do this.

39:16.022 --> 39:19.357
Come on, man, I don't even know
where that gun came from.

39:19.409 --> 39:21.344
Honest to God,
I don't know where it came from.

39:21.396 --> 39:22.598
Eddie...

39:22.623 --> 39:25.171
Eddie... Eddie, uh...

39:25.196 --> 39:27.084
- Oh, please, please...
- Drop it, Terry!

39:27.136 --> 39:28.490
Oh, God!

39:28.516 --> 39:29.427
Oh, God.

39:29.462 --> 39:30.522
Oh, God.

39:30.970 --> 39:32.203
Oh, God, thank you.

39:32.239 --> 39:33.326
Now.

39:35.072 --> 39:36.457
- Drop that gun.
- Oh, thank God.

39:36.492 --> 39:38.442
Thank God. Thank God.

39:38.478 --> 39:39.827
Oh, God...

39:39.862 --> 39:41.245
(Marco sobbing)

39:46.452 --> 39:48.386
(panting)

39:48.438 --> 39:50.087
Oh, thank God.

39:50.123 --> 39:51.355
(gunshot)

40:05.438 --> 40:06.772
Dammit, Terry.

40:08.384 --> 40:09.317
Why?

40:09.342 --> 40:10.424
Helpful tip you gave me.

40:10.610 --> 40:12.626
About the same gun being used

40:12.662 --> 40:14.812
against Ramon Baez and my boy Darryl?

40:14.864 --> 40:17.131
Marco, here, still had the same pistol

40:17.166 --> 40:18.912
he used when I found him.

40:19.235 --> 40:20.187
(chuckles)

40:20.239 --> 40:22.536
You know he killed Darryl
over a piece of tail?

40:24.340 --> 40:26.257
You didn't have to do this.

40:26.292 --> 40:29.060
That 90 grand that you said
you found at Darryl's place...

40:29.112 --> 40:30.151
Yeah.

40:30.203 --> 40:31.746
Was supposed to be 100.

40:31.781 --> 40:32.981
Marco wouldn't cop to it,

40:32.983 --> 40:35.833
but I'm led to believe
he pinched ten from the pile.

40:35.885 --> 40:37.201
Might've blown it on the girl;

40:37.236 --> 40:38.915
I heard she's flaunting
a few grand around her neck.

40:38.917 --> 40:40.219
This wasn't our deal.

40:41.154 --> 40:42.937
I can give you intel,
look the other way,

40:42.962 --> 40:44.244
but I can't watch you kill.

40:44.378 --> 40:46.194
That's where you draw the line, huh?

40:46.219 --> 40:47.552
I'm just saying, for both our sakes,

40:47.577 --> 40:49.127
we just need to make sure...

40:50.834 --> 40:52.122
There is no line.

40:53.052 --> 40:55.036
As long as you want your brother
protected in prison,

40:55.088 --> 40:57.104
you will do whatever I ask.

40:57.140 --> 40:58.629
And right now...

41:01.044 --> 41:03.010
(gasping)

41:04.584 --> 41:06.153
...you're getting rid of this.

41:10.581 --> 41:12.214
Pop a few more in him if it helps you.

41:12.548 --> 41:13.806
Helps me?

41:13.872 --> 41:15.079
Yeah.

41:15.454 --> 41:17.471
Sell it to your unit as a gang hit.

41:32.525 --> 41:33.808
(indistinct chatter, telephones ringing)

41:33.810 --> 41:35.209
It's crucial, Jimmy, crucial.

41:35.261 --> 41:36.826
Ray will be very appreciative.

41:37.814 --> 41:39.880
Thank you, my friend. Thank you.

41:39.932 --> 41:41.866
Ray! Carson's in.

41:41.901 --> 41:43.043
Way to go.

41:43.936 --> 41:45.399
Excuse me, ma'am.

41:45.739 --> 41:47.105
Can I help you?

41:47.911 --> 41:49.457
Hi.

41:49.509 --> 41:50.606
Jessie West.

41:50.631 --> 41:53.048
I'd like to volunteer
for Mr. Carroll's campaign.
