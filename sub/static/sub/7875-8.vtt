00:05.105 --> 00:07.335
# Good morning, U.S.A. #

00:07.440 --> 00:11.035
# I got a feeling that it's
gonna be a wonderful day #

00:11.144 --> 00:14.045
#The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face #

00:14.147 --> 00:17.913
#And he's shining a salute
to the American race #

00:20.587 --> 00:23.750
# Oh, boy
it's swell to say #

00:23.857 --> 00:26.792
<i># Good morning, U.S.A. #</i>

00:28.795 --> 00:30.660
<i>#Good morning, U.S.A. ##</i>

00:35.934 --> 00:38.994
Is everything ready?
Your father should be home any minute.

00:39.104 --> 00:43.734
I've modeled this year's star
after a real crowd-pleaser- Polaris.

00:43.842 --> 00:46.106
I initially considered Alpha Centauri...

00:46.211 --> 00:49.442
but I decided to go with what's right
instead of what's popular.

00:49.547 --> 00:53.643
Oh, honey. As long as it stays on top
of the tree, I could give a rat's ass.

00:53.752 --> 00:56.186
I picked up all
the Charlie Brown holiday specials.

00:56.287 --> 00:59.051
From the very first one where he learns
the true meaning of Christmas...

00:59.157 --> 01:01.751
to the one from the '80s
where he meets the kid with Al DS.

01:01.860 --> 01:04.795
Klaus, you got the train to work!

01:04.896 --> 01:08.696
Yeah! It's in my blood!
My grandfather was a conductor at Auschwitz.

01:08.800 --> 01:12.133
No, no, no. He ran the kiddie train at the zoo.

01:12.237 --> 01:16.606
- You know, it's a big town.
There's other stuff there.

01:16.708 --> 01:20.474
- Merry, merry, everyone!
- Wow! Great sweater, Roger.

01:20.578 --> 01:23.411
Thanks. I totally sniped it from a guy on eBay.

01:23.515 --> 01:27.246
I not only stole the sweater,
I stole his holiday spirit.

01:27.352 --> 01:30.344
And that made my holiday spirit
grow stronger.

01:30.455 --> 01:33.618
<i>Because that's how it works,
right? Like Highlander?</i>

01:33.725 --> 01:35.852
<i>" There can be only one"?</i>

01:35.960 --> 01:39.953
I've had- I've had, like, eight cups
of eggnog. And this makes 12!

01:40.065 --> 01:43.557
<i>That's your father! Places, everybody!</i>

01:43.668 --> 01:46.466
<i>Good job, guys. Everything's perfect.</i>

01:46.571 --> 01:50.735
Ho, ho, ho. No, no, no!
What happened here?

01:50.842 --> 01:53.037
What do you mean?
The halls are fully decked.

01:53.144 --> 01:55.271
Dad, we've been working
on this all day.

01:55.380 --> 01:57.280
Seriously?

01:57.382 --> 02:00.010
<i>I'd give you an " A" for effort,
but this isn't U.C. Santa Cruz.</i>

02:00.118 --> 02:02.586
- What did we do wrong?
- Where do I start?

02:02.687 --> 02:05.656
<i>Well, for one thing, the stockings.
They're supposed to be " hung with care...</i>

02:05.757 --> 02:07.952
in hopes that Saint Nicholas
soon would be there. "

02:08.059 --> 02:10.619
The I NXS guy hung himself
with more care.

02:10.728 --> 02:12.787
Death boner!

02:12.897 --> 02:16.856
And the nativity scene.
The three Wise Men look like transvestites.

02:16.968 --> 02:19.232
But the mannish kind.
Not the attractive Asian kind...

02:19.337 --> 02:21.965
you're always hoping your friends
will hire for your birthday party.

02:22.073 --> 02:24.337
Stan, you're ruining our Christmas!

02:24.442 --> 02:29.004
No, I'm trying to save your Christmas.
Now, come on. Let's go get a good tree.

02:29.114 --> 02:30.638
There's nothing wrong
with this tree.

02:30.748 --> 02:33.876
8:30 on Christmas Eve.
No one has any trees left.

02:33.985 --> 02:36.283
God does. We'll just go
to the woods and get one.

02:36.387 --> 02:40.050
Oh, my God!
I can see my heart light.

02:42.994 --> 02:45.019
- Here's a great tree.
- Wrong. Bare spot.

02:45.130 --> 02:46.859
- This one's nice.
- Lopsided.

02:46.965 --> 02:49.991
- How 'bout this one?
- Hayley, do you even know what a tree is? Keep looking.

02:50.101 --> 02:54.401
I'm bored. I'm gonna speed up this sweater
and pretend I'm in a dance club.

02:54.506 --> 02:57.236
# G-G-God rest ye
merry gentlemen #

02:57.342 --> 02:59.435
# I'm going to blow your mind #

02:59.544 --> 03:03.913
Ping, ping, bong, bong! Ping, ping, bong, bong!

03:04.015 --> 03:06.176
Roger, Christmas is
no time to be singing!

03:06.284 --> 03:09.378
Stan, we've been
wandering around for hours.

03:09.487 --> 03:13.548
Klaus's bowl is starting to freeze!
It must be 10 below out here.

03:13.658 --> 03:16.752
Fine. If you all hate Christmas so much,
you can go wait in the car.

03:16.861 --> 03:20.353
So what are you gonna do?
Spend all night looking for the perfect tree?

03:20.465 --> 03:23.366
- You'll catch your death out here!
- Honey, just because snow...

03:23.468 --> 03:26.369
is the same color as our refrigerator
doesn't mean you know how it works.

03:26.471 --> 03:29.872
Well, at least I don't think
I know everything about everything!

03:29.974 --> 03:33.876
Come on, you guys.
Hey, where's Steve? Steve!

03:33.978 --> 03:37.675
Over here! I was peeing on
a tree and it froze midstream.

03:37.782 --> 03:41.115
Hayley, go help your brother.

03:41.219 --> 03:43.619
Great Christmas, Stan!

03:45.223 --> 03:47.316
# Last night a Santa saved my life #

03:47.425 --> 03:49.985
<i>Okay, Steve. One, two-</i>

03:50.094 --> 03:52.961
<i>Thank you.</i>

03:53.064 --> 03:56.124
I don't know why Francine's mad at me
for always being right.

03:56.234 --> 03:58.998
I don't get mad at her
for always being wrong.

03:59.103 --> 04:03.199
Boobs are holding up nicely
for a gal her age, I'll say that.

04:03.308 --> 04:05.367
<i>The perfect tree!</i>

04:05.476 --> 04:07.103
I knew it!

04:08.313 --> 04:11.214
And Francine said
I'd die out here. Ha!

04:22.227 --> 04:25.628
Wow! I guess it is cold.

04:25.730 --> 04:28.631
Must sing to keep warm.

04:28.733 --> 04:32.760
# O Christmas tree
O Christmas tree #

04:32.870 --> 04:36.067
# Nobody knows as much as me ##

04:41.112 --> 04:44.343
That's what it would sound like
if I'd fallen much farther.

04:48.820 --> 04:51.186
The perfect tree.

04:56.261 --> 04:58.286
Perfect cut.

05:00.048 --> 05:04.314
Perfect amount of blood filling lungs.

05:04.418 --> 05:06.477
Wait. Now it's too much.

05:11.792 --> 05:13.692
What can I get you?

05:13.794 --> 05:16.786
Peppermint, sugarplum,
boysenberry cascade?

05:16.897 --> 05:19.331
We have any flavor
you could possibly imagine.

05:19.433 --> 05:22.266
- Vanilla?
- Ooh, we're out of vanilla.

05:22.369 --> 05:24.269
What's going on?
Where am I?

05:24.371 --> 05:27.204
Oh, we find people
take the news better with ice cream.

05:27.308 --> 05:29.776
- What news?
- Why, the news that you're dead.

05:29.877 --> 05:32.971
- Oh, my God!
- Relax. We have vanilla.

05:33.080 --> 05:36.106
See, we initially tell people
we don't have their flavor...

05:36.217 --> 05:39.778
so when we tell them we really do,
it makes them happy.

05:39.887 --> 05:43.823
<i>Ooh, boy. We're actually out of vanilla.</i>

05:43.924 --> 05:48.088
This has never happened before.
Still dead though.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.132
This is crazy!
There's no way I'm dead!

05:55.236 --> 05:57.136
I mean, if I'm dead,
where's Saint Peter?

05:57.238 --> 05:59.365
Where's the pearly gates?
Where are all the hos at?

05:59.473 --> 06:01.441
You mean heaven.
That's up there.

06:03.077 --> 06:05.705
That griffin's taking a load of saved souls
up there right now.

06:08.263 --> 06:10.356
<i>So that must be hell.</i>

06:10.465 --> 06:14.128
No, that's actually a camp for children
who have been sexually abused.

06:14.236 --> 06:18.138
They get to ride dragons.
It's a pretty great program.

06:18.240 --> 06:20.367
Anyway, this is limbo.

06:20.475 --> 06:22.534
<i>I'll be dropping you off
at that park bench up ahead.</i>

06:22.644 --> 06:24.544
In a couple weeks,
you'll get a letter telling you...

06:24.646 --> 06:27.308
whether you'll be
going up or going down.

06:27.415 --> 06:31.181
But that's not fair. I shouldn't be dead.
I know it. I want a second chance!

06:31.286 --> 06:32.913
What did you say?

06:33.021 --> 06:35.956
I want a second chance!

06:37.809 --> 06:39.936
The folks down at the courthouse
are not going to be happy...

06:40.044 --> 06:42.706
when they find out they
have to work Christmas Eve.

06:42.813 --> 06:45.907
- Courthouse?
- Well, you don't just get a second chance.

06:46.016 --> 06:48.041
You've got to prove
you deserve it in a trial.

06:48.152 --> 06:50.052
- Wait? A trial?
- Not to worry.

06:50.154 --> 06:54.716
<i>You'll be assigned a lawyer from the
greatest pool oflegal minds in the universe.</i>

06:54.825 --> 06:57.385
Ooh, I misspoke.

06:57.494 --> 06:59.394
Looks like you got Michelle.

07:03.133 --> 07:06.261
Ooh, God, could you
not flap over here?

07:06.370 --> 07:09.134
The papers I pretend
to look at when I'm in court.

07:09.239 --> 07:12.766
She's my lawyer? Can I pick another lawyer?
Where's Jewish heaven?

07:13.010 --> 07:16.605
So I've been reviewing your file. And I think
we have a really good case here, Phillip.

07:16.714 --> 07:20.150
Stan. And where are your wings?
Everyone else up here has wings.

07:20.250 --> 07:24.311
Look, I haven't earned them yet,
okay? But I'm really trying.

07:24.421 --> 07:28.380
You know what time
I got here this morning? 7:30. Yeah.

07:28.492 --> 07:31.290
Anyway, you don't need wings
to be a good lawyer.

07:31.395 --> 07:34.421
Yeah, don't worry, babe. This won't take long.
I'm up against Michelle.

07:34.531 --> 07:36.431
Yeah, I know.

07:36.533 --> 07:39.900
Anyway, I'll see you at home.
Ooh, I like it when you talk like that.

07:40.004 --> 07:44.805
When I get home, the things I am gonna do-
You're not gonna fly right for a week.

07:44.908 --> 07:47.900
Hey, good luck, pal.
You're gonna need it.

07:48.012 --> 07:50.173
He's gonna be just fine,
Scott!

07:50.280 --> 07:54.148
- Don't worry. He's just trying to psych us out.
- He doesn't look so tough.

07:54.251 --> 07:58.153
Actually, up here you get smaller and cuter
every time you win a case.

07:58.255 --> 08:00.655
Oh, my God! I'm screwed!
Look at him!

08:00.758 --> 08:04.558
He's cuter than a puppy and a kitten
trying to climb into the same slipper!

08:04.662 --> 08:07.631
All rise.

08:07.731 --> 08:09.926
- Oh, God. Not him.
- Why? What's wrong?

08:10.034 --> 08:11.399
Counselor.

08:11.502 --> 08:14.630
- Michelle.
- Hi, Daddy.

08:14.738 --> 08:18.196
- That's good, right?
- Um... sure.

08:18.308 --> 08:20.276
Okay, let's do this.
It's Christmas Eve...

08:20.377 --> 08:22.572
and we all want to get
toJesus' birthday party.

08:22.680 --> 08:26.047
- Those of us who were invited.
- Shut up, Scott!

08:26.150 --> 08:29.051
- Counselor, your opening statement?
- Thank you, Your Honor.

08:29.153 --> 08:32.714
Should Stan Smith
get a second chance?

08:32.823 --> 08:34.950
<i>He certainly thinks he should.</i>

08:35.058 --> 08:37.549
He thinks he knows better
than everybody.

08:37.660 --> 08:41.859
But we will prove his death
was a just and fitting end...

08:41.965 --> 08:47.062
to a lifelong pattern of arrogance
and know-it-allness!

08:47.171 --> 08:51.369
Does Stan Smith deserve
a second chance?

08:51.475 --> 08:54.239
<i>Not a chance.</i>

08:54.344 --> 08:57.404
We... disagree.

08:57.514 --> 08:59.539
<i>That's it? " We disagree"?</i>

08:59.650 --> 09:03.017
<i>Well, I can't say " we agree. "
That's how I lost my first 10 cases.</i>

09:03.120 --> 09:05.020
The court will now hear
the evidence.

09:05.122 --> 09:08.285
Bring in the spectral window
to the soul!

09:10.643 --> 09:13.077
<i>Exhibit " A."</i>

09:13.178 --> 09:16.875
The baby will be here any day now.
Just relax and stay off your feet.

09:16.982 --> 09:18.882
No. We have a big trip planned.

09:18.984 --> 09:22.818
Mr. Smith, I don't think you understand.
Your wife's nine months pregnant.

09:22.922 --> 09:27.018
- She can't travel.
- Okay, okay. I hear you.

09:27.126 --> 09:30.220
- Oh, I'm sorry, Stan.
- I'm sorry too.

09:30.329 --> 09:33.492
Sorry we went with such an idiot doctor.
We're taking that trip.

09:33.599 --> 09:35.931
Oh, yeah. It's not ripe yet.

09:36.035 --> 09:38.868
You know, I used to spend
my summers working at the farmer's market.

09:38.971 --> 09:42.771
Sold novelty license plates.
You got another month minimum.

09:45.010 --> 09:48.138
I think my water just broke.

09:48.247 --> 09:50.238
Nonsense.
You're just having your period.

09:50.349 --> 09:54.786
I'm putting in my earplugs.
We're running with the zebras in the morning.

10:14.206 --> 10:16.766
Hey. Francine,
you make coffee?

10:16.875 --> 10:19.400
In my defense,
she hadn't made coffee.

10:21.246 --> 10:25.478
There are hundreds of other examples
of Stan Smith's arrogance.

10:25.584 --> 10:30.214
Thousands even.
Millions? Perhaps. Billions?

10:30.322 --> 10:33.655
Does anyone here believe
there are billions of other examples?

10:33.759 --> 10:35.488
I do.

10:35.594 --> 10:39.257
Well, there you have it.
The prosecution rests.

10:39.365 --> 10:44.064
- Counselor?
- Time to give him the old razzle-dazzle!

10:44.169 --> 10:47.536
Your Honor, the prosecution
could spend all day...

10:47.640 --> 10:50.131
showing instances of my client's
moral shortcomings...

10:50.242 --> 10:54.941
while I can provide
only one example of his humility.

10:55.047 --> 10:57.675
- Hmph!
- But this example...

10:57.783 --> 11:02.345
is so overwhelming
in its display of his generosity...

11:02.454 --> 11:05.981
humanity, and willingness to learn
from the wisdom of others...

11:06.091 --> 11:10.824
that you will forget everything
you think you know about Stan Smith!

11:10.929 --> 11:12.897
Let's watch.

11:13.932 --> 11:15.832
Spare some change?

11:15.934 --> 11:18.630
You don't have to give him change,
but at least acknowledge him.

11:18.737 --> 11:21.467
Okay. You're blocking
the sidewalk, wino!

11:21.573 --> 11:23.973
That's not what I'm talking about.
He's a person.

11:24.076 --> 11:26.567
<i>Doesn't the Bible say,
"Look upon the corn and the wheat...</i>

11:26.679 --> 11:28.579
for even the chaff
have their place"?

11:28.681 --> 11:32.173
Wow. You're right, Steve.
I'm humbled by you.

11:32.284 --> 11:35.447
Sorry I called you a wino,
Chaff. What brings you to this low place?

11:35.554 --> 11:39.149
- I'm too sick to work.
- Say no more.

11:39.258 --> 11:41.920
Kidney transplants
are a dangerous procedure.

11:42.027 --> 11:44.154
Are you sure you want
to go through with this, Mr. Smith?

11:44.263 --> 11:46.561
After all, he's just a bum.

11:46.665 --> 11:49.429
That's what I used to think
until my son taught me different.

11:49.535 --> 11:51.435
You ready, Chris?

11:51.537 --> 11:54.529
Stan Smith, you're an angel.

11:54.640 --> 11:57.302
That's my dad.

11:57.409 --> 12:02.346
I guess you could say this father
realized he didn't know best.

12:02.448 --> 12:05.781
Clearly this man-
this good man-

12:05.884 --> 12:08.114
deserves a second chance.

12:08.220 --> 12:10.848
Well, in light of that
compelling evidence...

12:10.956 --> 12:13.254
I have no choice
but to grant Stan Smith-

12:13.358 --> 12:17.886
Excuse me, Your Honor?
Could we just roll the rest of that clip?

12:17.996 --> 12:22.956
- Stan Smith, you're an angel.
- That's my dad.

12:23.068 --> 12:25.332
What? What's wrong?

12:25.437 --> 12:29.066
Oh, God! I had the worst nightmare!
I took advice from Steve!

12:29.174 --> 12:32.075
Why would I give my kidney to a bum?

12:32.177 --> 12:34.304
Stay out of my dreams!

12:35.647 --> 12:37.672
I'm sorry.

12:37.783 --> 12:39.683
I only watched the beginning...

12:39.785 --> 12:42.515
'cause my cat started making
this weird wheezing sound.

12:42.621 --> 12:46.990
I think he's allergic to salmon.
Can a cat be allergic to salmon?

12:47.092 --> 12:49.287
There's no way I'm getting
a second chance.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.726
How's my family ever
gonna get by without me?

12:51.830 --> 12:54.924
If it makes you feel any better,
they're gonna be dead in about 20 minutes.

12:55.033 --> 12:57.194
- What?
- You left them in the middle of a snowstorm.

12:57.302 --> 12:59.930
- They're about to freeze to death.
- But they're in a car.

13:00.038 --> 13:02.529
- They can just turn on the heater.
- Yeah. You took the keys.

13:05.143 --> 13:07.805
Don't you love this cold?
It reminds me of my planet.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.777
#Jingle to the bell #

13:09.881 --> 13:13.908
#Jing, jingle, jingle, bell, bell
Jing, jingle, jingle ##

13:14.018 --> 13:16.043
Hey, how come everybody's dying?

13:16.154 --> 13:18.384
Oh, no. I've gotta do something!

13:18.490 --> 13:20.720
Well, let me handle this.
You don't know what you're doing.

13:20.825 --> 13:23.259
I know more than you!
What kind of lawyer are you?

13:23.361 --> 13:26.387
Sir, I am a lady lawyer.

13:26.498 --> 13:30.559
Your Honor, my family's in terrible danger.
You have to give me a second chance!

13:30.668 --> 13:33.034
Sorry. Second chance denied.

13:33.138 --> 13:36.733
Yes! Got you, you arrogant,
prideful, son of a bitch!

13:36.841 --> 13:40.902
Me! This guy! Scott LaRose!
I'm the best!

13:42.914 --> 13:44.814
No! Wait! Your Honor...

13:44.916 --> 13:47.407
there's one more piece of evidence
you haven't looked at.

13:47.519 --> 13:49.817
Everybody on the ground now!

13:49.921 --> 13:52.321
Earthly guns have no power here.

13:52.424 --> 13:55.450
I'm sorry.
I just want to save my family.

13:55.560 --> 13:57.551
I'm begging you!

13:57.662 --> 14:00.995
- Everybody on the ground now!
- He's got a heaven gun!

14:01.099 --> 14:03.397
- Those can kill anybody!
- Why do we have those again?

14:03.501 --> 14:05.935
What are you doing?
There's no way out of this.

14:06.037 --> 14:09.632
Yes, there is. I'm gonna get my second chance.
We're going over your head.

14:09.741 --> 14:13.404
- We?
- Yeah. You're taking me to God.

14:13.511 --> 14:16.275
<i>Seriously, why do we have heaven guns?
I don't mean to be "that guy. '"</i>

14:16.381 --> 14:18.645
I'm happy here.
But why is this not an issue?

14:22.387 --> 14:24.218
Out of my way!

14:24.322 --> 14:26.882
Now where's God?
And don't say everywhere or I swear I'll-

14:26.991 --> 14:30.290
I don't know. Probably in heaven
atJ.C.'s birthday party.

14:30.395 --> 14:32.989
- Then that's where we're going.
- I can't get you in there.

14:33.097 --> 14:35.725
- I wasn't even on the Evite.
- This is our Evite!

14:35.834 --> 14:38.632
<i>I just clicked " Yes, plus one. "</i>

14:41.905 --> 14:45.033
We gotta figure out a way
to get on that griffin.

14:45.142 --> 14:47.474
<i>Who are they?</i>

14:47.577 --> 14:51.877
The archangels. Heavenly enforcers
that carry flaming swords of vengeance...

14:51.982 --> 14:55.645
and pamphlets on how to talk to your kids
about how abstinence can be cool.

14:55.752 --> 14:58.050
Damn it! There's got
to be another way out of this place.

14:58.155 --> 14:59.850
Which one's yours?

14:59.956 --> 15:02.151
A chariot on my salary?
Please.

15:02.259 --> 15:05.023
There's a tub of chili in my fridge
I stole from the office potluck.

15:05.128 --> 15:07.858
I've been eating it for a year.
I don't live well.

15:07.964 --> 15:09.989
Come on! Drive!

15:16.039 --> 15:19.566
Wow! Who would have thought heaven
would be so beautiful?

15:19.676 --> 15:23.009
Yeah. It's great if you have your wings.
Otherwise, you're a nobody.

15:23.113 --> 15:27.607
Hey, you're not a nobody. You're an expendable
pawn in my quest to save my family.

15:27.717 --> 15:30.914
- You hold onto that.
- Look, I'm not gonna be any help to you.

15:31.021 --> 15:33.353
I only met God once
and he thinks I'm an idiot.

15:33.456 --> 15:35.549
We were at this bar.
And I was really drunk.

15:35.659 --> 15:38.457
And we got into this argument
about abortion. And I tried to kiss him.

15:38.562 --> 15:41.531
<i>Quiet! We've got company.</i>

15:41.631 --> 15:45.590
Heaven gun, it's time for you
to preach to the choir.

16:05.021 --> 16:08.422
Halo... and good-bye.

16:11.428 --> 16:14.591
<i>Not even a smile?
I said " halo" instead of" hello. "</i>

16:14.698 --> 16:16.359
Oh, screw you.
That's funny.

16:19.635 --> 16:22.502
- I can't do this.
- Just act natural.

16:22.605 --> 16:25.631
Hey, Pete. Got a soul for you.

16:25.741 --> 16:28.574
A Mr. Johann Stippler.

16:28.678 --> 16:31.647
<i>- Ja. Ja. Johann. Ja. Ja.
- Yeah. He doesn't speak English.</i>

16:31.747 --> 16:34.580
Oh, okay. Have a nice eternity.

16:36.819 --> 16:39.583
Thank you.
I mean- I mean-

16:39.689 --> 16:41.714
<i>German for " thank you. "
Donkey something.</i>

16:41.824 --> 16:46.056
- Freeze!
- He's crazy! He made me do it!

16:46.162 --> 16:49.825
You're in a lot of trouble, buddy. Last guy
who tried to sneak in here was Jim Henson.

16:49.932 --> 16:51.900
<i>And we all know what happened to him.</i>

16:53.402 --> 16:56.633
- Why'd you do that?
- 'Cause you gotta save your family.

16:56.738 --> 17:00.435
And if God's not gonna give me my wings,
I'm gonna at least drink his booze. Come on!

17:00.542 --> 17:03.705
- So what happened toJim Henson?
- You don't want to know.

17:06.214 --> 17:07.646
Forgive us!

17:07.749 --> 17:11.013
You will bow down before me, Son of God!

17:11.118 --> 17:15.488
- That's God's house? Wow.
- Yeah, he inherited it.

17:15.589 --> 17:18.787
- There's too much security. We'll never get in.
- What are you? Chicken?

17:18.894 --> 17:22.125
Oh, no. That's right.
Chickens have wings.

17:22.230 --> 17:24.960
I'm- I'm sorry.
I thought you knew.

17:27.935 --> 17:29.733
That's it! Come on!

17:31.507 --> 17:33.498
- We're with the band.
- Names?

17:33.608 --> 17:36.634
- Donny and Marie Osmond.
- I didn't know you guys were dead.

17:36.744 --> 17:40.111
We're Mormons.
We were born dead.

17:40.214 --> 17:42.944
Good thing that bouncer knew
the truth about Mormons.

17:45.019 --> 17:47.112
I can't believe I'm really here!

17:47.221 --> 17:49.712
Oh, my God!
I don't have a present.

17:52.160 --> 17:56.563
<i>" From Galileo. "
And Michelle.</i>

17:56.664 --> 17:59.360
- Okay, now, where's God?
- I don't know. But there's J.C.

17:59.467 --> 18:03.767
I mean, I could be mad. I probably
should be mad. But what can I say?

18:03.871 --> 18:08.467
They knew not what they did.
They-They just knew not.

18:08.576 --> 18:11.602
They know now. I'll tell you that much.

18:11.713 --> 18:13.738
<i>Hey,J. C! We're out of sushi!</i>

18:13.848 --> 18:16.180
<i>- Check again.
- Thank you!</i>

18:16.284 --> 18:18.184
Okay, we gotta find God.

18:18.286 --> 18:21.517
You become a hopeless alcoholic
and hit rock bottom. I'll search rooms.

18:33.634 --> 18:36.899
<i>Hey, what are you-
Come on. Holy Spirit in here! ¡Ocupado!</i>

18:37.004 --> 18:38.972
Oh, sorry.

18:43.810 --> 18:45.710
Nice office.

18:51.785 --> 18:55.118
These things rule.
Why'd I ever send 'em to Mars?

18:55.222 --> 18:59.124
- Hello, Stan.
- If you know who I am, then you know why I'm here.

18:59.226 --> 19:02.252
I know everything.
I guess that makes two of us, huh?

19:02.362 --> 19:03.659
Look, sir-

19:05.098 --> 19:07.225
<i>- You, uh, unplugged the sun.
- Oh, sorry.</i>

19:09.736 --> 19:12.796
Look, I'm just gonna cut to the chase.
I'm not gonna help you.

19:12.906 --> 19:16.307
What? Then just help my family.
You can't let them die!

19:16.410 --> 19:18.640
Look, everything happens
for a reason.

19:18.745 --> 19:20.406
What reason could there be?

19:20.514 --> 19:23.915
Stan, I'm gonna level with you.
If your family is allowed to live...

19:24.017 --> 19:27.714
Stanford's tennis team
will go 0 and 8 in conference play.

19:27.821 --> 19:30.051
- What?
- I'm just messing with you.

19:30.157 --> 19:33.524
<i>The point is " mysterious ways,"
"have a little faith," " I'm in the details. "</i>

19:33.627 --> 19:36.619
Now, come on. You can be triceratops.
I know he's your favorite.

19:36.730 --> 19:40.131
We're out of time!
Now send me back so I can save my family.

19:40.233 --> 19:42.133
- Not gonna happen.
- You have to!

19:42.235 --> 19:45.830
Oh, okay. So you know better than me?
Is that it? You're all knowing?

19:45.939 --> 19:49.136
No. Yes!
L- I don't know!

19:49.242 --> 19:52.211
Exactly. You don't know.
You can't know.

19:52.312 --> 19:55.873
- So stop trying to control everything.
- I don't do that.

19:55.983 --> 19:58.747
Stan, you're holding a gun to God's head.

19:58.852 --> 20:01.548
I mean, I can't even think of a metaphor
that's better than this.

20:01.655 --> 20:05.318
And I'm a published poet.
Now, come on. Put it down.

20:05.425 --> 20:07.723
- But my family-
- Stan...

20:07.828 --> 20:09.728
put the gun down
and let my will be done.

20:13.166 --> 20:17.728
<i>- I'm sorry.
- " So shines a good deed in a weary world. "</i>

20:19.339 --> 20:20.829
- What?
- That's all I wanted.

20:20.941 --> 20:24.672
One small act of humility.
Okay, you can go back.

20:24.778 --> 20:27.611
- Really?
- Eh, it's my kid's birthday.

20:27.714 --> 20:32.674
Thank you! Thank you! Oh, I'll never ask for
anything again! Oh, there's just one more thing.

20:37.457 --> 20:39.652
Nice wings. Those real?

20:39.759 --> 20:43.092
Um, yes. Yes, they are.

20:45.765 --> 20:47.858
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

20:47.967 --> 20:51.926
But, Stan, don't you ever
pull a gun on me again!

20:53.873 --> 20:58.105
- What's wrong?
- I'm- I'm home. I'm home!

20:58.210 --> 21:00.974
Do you like the way we decorated?

21:02.081 --> 21:04.549
It's perfect.
Everything's perfect.

21:04.650 --> 21:07.881
- You think so?
- I couldn't have done it better myself.

21:07.987 --> 21:09.955
Merry Christmas!

21:13.893 --> 21:18.523
There's a flying hooker watching you hug.
Go away, hooker!

21:52.863 --> 21:54.763
Bye. Have a beautiful time!
