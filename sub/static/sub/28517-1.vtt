04:30.175 --> 04:31.647
and we don't know where Frank is.

04:31.649 --> 04:33.083

Just tell us, tell us Frank.

04:57.255 --> 04:58.873
Fuck off.

04:58.875 --> 05:00.333
Tell us and we can go home.

05:00.335 --> 05:01.166
I wouldn't tell you

05:01.168 --> 05:02.713
if I had to kiss his
fucking throbbing cock.

05:02.715 --> 05:05.665
Well then you'd be at the front
of the queue, wouldn't you?

05:06.886 --> 05:08.382
Go on, go on.

05:08.384 --> 05:11.112
Frank, I'm telling
you, don't say that.

05:11.114 --> 05:13.114
You're supposed to talk.

05:16.833 --> 05:18.434
You're a dumb bitch aren't you

05:18.436 --> 05:21.697
and you're loving it,
mini knob, mini knob.

05:21.699 --> 05:23.061
Don't talk about that.

05:23.063 --> 05:26.730
I'll kill you, I'll
kill you, I'll kill you.

05:48.061 --> 05:48.894
Fuck!

05:49.733 --> 05:51.733
Give us a week.

05:51.735 --> 05:54.308
We'll find Frank and we'll find the money.

05:57.733 --> 06:00.712
You're not back here in
four days with my money,

06:04.902 --> 06:09.544
I'm gonna grind this
so far up your crease,

06:09.546 --> 06:13.204
you'll be chewing corn for breakfast.

06:39.905 --> 06:41.178
What we gonna do?

06:43.805 --> 06:45.858
How we gonna find Frank in four days?

06:47.705 --> 06:50.603
Well it's gonna take
longer than that, isn't it?

06:50.605 --> 06:52.183
You are one dumb piece of shit

06:52.185 --> 06:53.693
aren't you, Boxy?

06:53.695 --> 06:54.526
Why?

06:54.528 --> 06:56.843
Because he's floating
down the fucking canal.

06:56.845 --> 06:58.073
Well that's what I mean.

06:58.075 --> 06:59.043
He could be anywhere.

06:59.045 --> 07:00.743
He could be in Liverpool by now.

07:00.745 --> 07:02.068
I swear Boxy.

07:02.070 --> 07:02.901
What?

07:02.903 --> 07:06.148
Shut up or I'm gonna
bash your brains in.

07:07.545 --> 07:10.031
Is it this left or the next?

07:26.225 --> 07:27.056
Miss Moon,

07:27.058 --> 07:29.013
my name is detective
inspector Helen Wilkes.

07:29.015 --> 07:30.391
I understand that you've
got some information

07:30.393 --> 07:33.113
concerning the Charles Sunday murders.

07:33.115 --> 07:34.322
Yes.

07:34.324 --> 07:37.488
I know where Donna Brown
and Kevin Smart are buried.

07:39.355 --> 07:40.478
How can you possibly know

07:40.480 --> 07:43.063
where the bodies of those children are?

07:43.065 --> 07:44.368
Sunday told me.

07:46.365 --> 07:47.523
Charles Sunday died

07:47.525 --> 07:50.827
while you were sucking lollipops, love.

07:50.829 --> 07:53.263
Have they told you?

07:53.265 --> 07:54.948
I'm a psychic medium inspector.

07:56.655 --> 07:57.488
Christ.

08:02.573 --> 08:03.993
Miss Moon, I suggest you leave

08:03.995 --> 08:06.893
before I charge you with
wasting police time.

08:06.895 --> 08:09.623
But I can lead you to
where they're buried.

08:09.625 --> 08:10.458
I can.

08:11.605 --> 08:12.493
We've spent years

08:12.495 --> 08:15.728
crawling over the life of that sick man.

08:16.705 --> 08:18.855
What could you possibly
know that we don't?

08:22.865 --> 08:25.623
He cut off their fingers
after they were dead,

08:25.625 --> 08:27.138
kept them in a shoe box.

08:28.365 --> 08:29.752
You found 'em, didn't you,

08:30.955 --> 08:32.477
kept it from the families?

08:38.942 --> 08:40.025
Wait there.

08:47.232 --> 08:48.733
Look, we're here to get information.

08:48.735 --> 08:50.368
Do not play happy families.

08:51.726 --> 08:52.723
You get me?

08:52.725 --> 08:53.558
Yeah.

09:08.312 --> 09:09.355
Hello boys.

09:09.357 --> 09:10.188
Hello.

09:10.190 --> 09:12.595
Great to see you, Boxy lad, come here.

09:15.035 --> 09:16.196
Oh steady arm, Boxy,

09:16.198 --> 09:17.963
I thought you were going in for a smacker.

09:17.965 --> 09:18.913
Leave it out, Tracey,

09:18.915 --> 09:20.452
you're like my mother.

09:20.454 --> 09:22.643
I'm nothing like your mother darling

09:22.645 --> 09:24.333
but I appreciate the sentiment.

09:24.335 --> 09:26.035
Go on through and stick kettle on.

09:29.795 --> 09:30.764
Off yourself Tariq,

09:30.766 --> 09:32.433
in the AM take away.

09:48.545 --> 09:50.933
Sorry about the Tariq, I forgot.

09:50.935 --> 09:51.766
It's fine.

09:51.768 --> 09:54.830
Here, let me roast up a
nice cheese and tomato toast.

09:54.832 --> 09:56.197
I'm not hungry, honestly.

09:56.199 --> 09:57.603
You should eat, lad.

09:57.605 --> 09:59.091
I do.

09:59.093 --> 10:00.873
Know what
Frank always says, Box?

10:00.875 --> 10:01.753
Feed the body.

10:01.755 --> 10:02.888
Feed the mind.

10:02.890 --> 10:03.723
Right.

10:06.435 --> 10:08.335
I'm glad you mentioned Frank, Trace.

10:09.955 --> 10:11.775
We wanted to ask

10:12.836 --> 10:15.512
does he ever bring anything home?

10:15.514 --> 10:16.345
What, like the clap?

10:16.347 --> 10:17.178
What do you mean?

10:17.180 --> 10:18.723
No, work stuff.

10:18.725 --> 10:20.258
Does he bring work stuff home?

10:21.967 --> 10:25.273
Uh uh, no but I wish
he'd bring himself home.

10:25.275 --> 10:27.173
Lucy's missing him like mad.

10:27.175 --> 10:28.193
Where is she?

10:28.195 --> 10:29.783
She's taken to her bed.

10:29.785 --> 10:31.053
She won't eat,

10:31.055 --> 10:32.553
she can't sleep.

10:32.555 --> 10:33.667
Oh that's terrible.

10:33.669 --> 10:35.981
I've tried making her favourite dinners,

10:35.983 --> 10:38.123
taking her to get her nails done.

10:38.125 --> 10:39.433
Nothing.

10:39.435 --> 10:40.268
Sorry Trace.

10:42.015 --> 10:43.163
She might come down in a minute

10:43.165 --> 10:44.428
if she hears your voice.

10:45.839 --> 10:50.059
Does he have a shed Tracey,
you know, a lock up somewhere?

10:50.061 --> 10:51.693
Why don't you ask Frank?

10:51.695 --> 10:53.703
He's away on business for a few days,

10:53.705 --> 10:55.698
asked us to sort something out for him.

11:01.151 --> 11:02.672
I fancy a brew lads,

11:02.674 --> 11:04.238
I won't be a sec.

11:10.279 --> 11:11.203
Stop fucking around.

11:11.205 --> 11:12.773
Start searching the house.

11:12.775 --> 11:13.606
What for?

11:13.608 --> 11:14.998
Keys, anything.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.092
Now go on, fuck off.

11:20.145 --> 11:23.403
I'm just gonna pop
upstairs, Trish, see Lucy,

11:23.405 --> 11:25.246
see if I can cheer her up a bit.

11:25.248 --> 11:27.165
Alright love.

11:45.285 --> 11:47.098
He's got a kind heart, has Boxy?

11:48.665 --> 11:49.688
Yeah, he does.

11:50.965 --> 11:53.633
I'm glad me and Frank
took him under our wing.

11:53.635 --> 11:54.892
Yeah, it's kind of you.

11:57.033 --> 11:57.864
So does...

11:57.866 --> 11:59.583
I sometimes worry

11:59.585 --> 12:02.728
that folks take advantage
of his simple nature.

12:04.815 --> 12:07.513
But then I remember he's got
my Frank covering his asshole

12:07.515 --> 12:09.008
so he's bound to be alright.

12:12.395 --> 12:15.298
He has got my Frank covering
his asshole, ain't he, Tariq?

12:16.575 --> 12:17.688
Yeah, course.

12:18.785 --> 12:19.618
Good.

12:20.885 --> 12:23.508
We just want to know if he
keeps stuff around the house.

12:24.735 --> 12:27.261
Frank never
talks about his work.

12:27.263 --> 12:28.430
Why?

12:29.436 --> 12:31.787
He never brings anything home.

12:31.789 --> 12:33.706
Are you sure?

12:34.715 --> 12:37.661
And he'd never go
away without telling me.

12:37.663 --> 12:41.115
What the fuck's going on, Tariq?

13:35.756 --> 13:37.259
What'd you find?

13:55.701 --> 13:57.478
Why the fuck did you have to bring Lucy?

13:58.631 --> 14:01.143
She's all I got left now thanks to you.

14:01.145 --> 14:01.976
Tracey knew.

14:01.978 --> 14:03.523
She would've told the cops.

14:03.525 --> 14:04.358
No way.

14:05.653 --> 14:08.868
Or Uday after he used his
cricket on her a few times.

14:14.075 --> 14:15.763
Can we at least take Lucy out the boat?

14:15.765 --> 14:17.215
She's not crying, is she?

14:18.415 --> 14:19.573
Missing mommy and all that bugger.

14:19.575 --> 14:20.406
Fuck that no way,

14:20.408 --> 14:21.475
not in my fucking car.

14:23.405 --> 14:24.663
Besides, you're the one
that brought her along,

14:24.665 --> 14:25.883
it's your responsibility.

14:25.885 --> 14:27.278
It was up to me, I'd just.

14:28.755 --> 14:31.018
No chance, no chance.

14:41.036 --> 14:43.057
There's a box here.

14:43.059 --> 14:44.153
We've got to get out of the country.

14:44.155 --> 14:46.033
Bring your girlfriend,
what's her name, Dawn?

14:46.035 --> 14:47.141
Dawn, yeah?

14:47.143 --> 14:48.918
Bring Dawn and Louise.

14:50.607 --> 14:51.523
Can't take that shit.

14:51.525 --> 14:53.523
News, our
headlines this hour.

14:53.525 --> 14:56.553
Two bodies have been
discovered on Baildonmoor.

14:56.555 --> 14:59.183
It's believed they're the
Sunday school murder victims,

14:59.185 --> 15:01.753
Donna Brown and Kevin Smart.

15:01.755 --> 15:03.653
Police are being assisted in their search

15:03.655 --> 15:06.153
by a Bradford woman, Alice Moon,

15:06.155 --> 15:09.633
who controversially claims
she can talk to the dead.

15:09.635 --> 15:10.466
In other news,

15:10.468 --> 15:11.343
a leading drugs charity...

15:11.345 --> 15:12.868
You believe in all that?

15:12.870 --> 15:14.120
What?

15:15.578 --> 15:17.828
Do you believe in that...

15:18.959 --> 15:21.428
Life after death, spirits, when you die?

15:22.600 --> 15:23.548
No way.

15:24.617 --> 15:25.517
It's all bullshit.

15:28.178 --> 15:30.203
We're
seeing a massive increase

15:30.205 --> 15:31.855
in drugs coming in straight from.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.772
Kevin Smart.

Kevin Smart and Donna Brown,

15:49.725 --> 15:53.003
victims of notorious child
killer Charles Sunday.

15:53.005 --> 15:55.789
Ah babe, get packing babe, get packing.

15:55.791 --> 15:57.293
I'm working at a saloon tomorrow, Box.

15:57.295 --> 16:00.249
You can get a saloon
job when we get out there.

16:00.251 --> 16:02.283
Well how long are we going for?

16:02.285 --> 16:03.116
20 years.

16:03.118 --> 16:03.951
What?

16:05.505 --> 16:07.139
Look,

16:07.141 --> 16:09.502
we're gonna live out there.

16:09.504 --> 16:10.853
It's no big deal.

16:10.855 --> 16:11.893
No big deal?

16:11.895 --> 16:15.153
No, we fly out and we buy a house.

16:15.155 --> 16:15.986
It's easy.

16:15.988 --> 16:17.708
What's happened, Boxy?

16:18.924 --> 16:20.233
Don't ask me what.

16:20.235 --> 16:21.496
I can't tell you, babe.

16:21.498 --> 16:23.643
What about my friends and my mom?

16:23.645 --> 16:25.087
You don't even like your mom.

16:25.089 --> 16:26.589
What about Tracey and Frank?

16:28.436 --> 16:29.853
What about Tariq?

16:31.467 --> 16:33.097
Look,

16:33.099 --> 16:35.140
don't worry about them.

16:35.142 --> 16:36.693
It's you and me that I care about.

16:36.695 --> 16:37.993
This is mental,

16:37.995 --> 16:39.561
surely you can see that.

16:39.563 --> 16:41.633
Mental is when you've got a bloke

16:41.635 --> 16:44.085
who wants to stick a
cricket bat up your asshole.

16:45.215 --> 16:47.203
Look, I've got to get away from here, Dawn

16:47.205 --> 16:49.268
and I really want you to come with me.

17:15.037 --> 17:18.083
The father are the kind
that burnt you at the stake.

17:18.085 --> 17:20.713
I just want to do the right thing,

17:20.714 --> 17:22.598
bring closure to the families.

17:37.857 --> 17:42.857
Alice, I'm not
buying this mumbo jumbo bullshit.

17:43.025 --> 17:44.542
Thanks for the lift.

17:45.750 --> 17:47.417
We'll be in touch.

18:46.339 --> 18:49.033
With a gentle bit of
drizzle throughout the day.

18:49.035 --> 18:50.523
Now as we move onwards,

18:50.525 --> 18:52.883
we'll see that rain drift away

18:52.885 --> 18:56.513
and it'll get warmer, generally dryer.

18:56.515 --> 18:58.069
It's about making sure

18:58.071 --> 19:01.140
with high temperatures
around 10 to 11 degrees.

19:01.142 --> 19:02.098
Moved away

19:02.100 --> 19:04.267
and become generally drier

19:05.445 --> 19:08.445
with temperatures around 10 degrees.

19:10.513 --> 19:14.053
Tomorrow is a widening
band of cloud and rain

19:14.055 --> 19:15.699
pushing slowly southwards

19:15.701 --> 19:18.243
and then throughout the day,

19:18.245 --> 19:19.715
it'll be gentle and wetter.

19:51.405 --> 19:52.906
Yeah I'm just at home,

19:52.908 --> 19:54.289
just not doing anything,

19:54.291 --> 19:55.928
just watching TV.

19:58.195 --> 20:01.148
Yeah I know, you didn't
ask about the wedding.

20:02.447 --> 20:03.723
Yeah, uh huh.

20:03.725 --> 20:06.763
Now not much is known about
this Bradford woman Alice Moon

20:06.765 --> 20:08.583
other than we have a promotional flyer

20:08.585 --> 20:10.100
with a picture of her.

20:10.102 --> 20:11.503
Can I ring you back?

20:11.505 --> 20:12.678
I'm just a bit busy.

20:13.515 --> 20:14.913
Yeah, yeah,

20:14.915 --> 20:15.746
I got to go,

20:15.748 --> 20:16.733
I'll ring you back later, yeah, okay?

20:16.735 --> 20:17.566
Alright, I love you, okay,

20:17.568 --> 20:18.401
I love you, bye bye.

20:20.359 --> 20:22.746
What you can see behind
me here on Baildonmoor

20:22.748 --> 20:25.043
is that a major police investigation

20:25.045 --> 20:27.883
is taking place as two
bodies have been found,

20:27.885 --> 20:31.563
both believed to be those of
Kevin Smart and Donna Brown,

20:31.565 --> 20:35.123
victim's of notorious child
killer Charles Sunday.

20:35.125 --> 20:38.903
Now in a bizarre twist
to this horrific crime,

20:38.905 --> 20:40.687
a lady named Alice Moon,

20:40.689 --> 20:42.553
who's a psychic medium

20:42.555 --> 20:45.193
and professes to be able
to speak to the dead

20:45.195 --> 20:47.038
has led police to this very spot.

20:50.245 --> 20:52.885
Dawn, have you seen my Night Rider DVDs?

21:00.715 --> 21:01.546
Yeah?

21:01.548 --> 21:02.630
Right, I've got an idea.

21:02.632 --> 21:03.618
Where's Lucy?

21:05.908 --> 21:07.103
I put her in the shed.

21:07.105 --> 21:08.734
What the fuck's she doing in the shed?

21:08.736 --> 21:11.297
I can't tell Dawn why she's here.

21:11.299 --> 21:14.307
Well listen, just go get
a photo of her right now.

21:14.309 --> 21:15.443
A photo?

21:15.445 --> 21:16.276
Just get it fucking done,

21:16.278 --> 21:17.185
I'll ring you back.

22:36.205 --> 22:37.168
Of course, uncle.

22:41.430 --> 22:45.512
Fuck, fuck you all, man!

22:45.514 --> 22:47.181
And fuck Dusseldorf.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.958
You, come lick my dick.

24:58.707 --> 25:00.623
Don't fuck with the Asians.

25:00.625 --> 25:03.455
So don't fuck with the Asians.

25:45.277 --> 25:46.743
This is never gonna work.

25:46.745 --> 25:48.375
Shut the fuck up.

25:53.221 --> 25:55.176
Looks like they've arrived.

25:55.178 --> 25:56.293
Fireworks in the sky

25:56.295 --> 25:57.945
Everyone's getting high.

26:01.695 --> 26:03.513
Police business.

26:03.515 --> 26:05.163
It's those trendy southern bastards

26:05.165 --> 26:07.513
from the end of the street, isn't it?

26:07.515 --> 26:09.053
I knew there were dodgy fuckers.

26:09.055 --> 26:10.610
Yes, it's them
at the end of the street.

26:10.612 --> 26:12.503
Make sure you taser the twats.

26:12.505 --> 26:14.762
Yes mam, just get back inside.

26:36.260 --> 26:37.543
Hello?

26:37.545 --> 26:40.213
We've got a 10 AM appointment.

26:40.215 --> 26:41.453
You're a bit early,

26:41.455 --> 26:43.537
I'm still in my pyjamas.

26:43.539 --> 26:46.166
Bollocks, it is.

26:46.168 --> 26:47.918
Ah, please!

26:59.892 --> 27:01.642
Go on then.

27:03.825 --> 27:05.552
Do whatever it is you do.

27:13.689 --> 27:17.388
You told them cops
where to find them kids.

27:18.395 --> 27:19.848
No one got paid or killed.

27:22.985 --> 27:25.135
You do all this mysterious
shit, don't you?

27:26.745 --> 27:29.078
I don't use a Ouija board.

27:30.157 --> 27:31.593
I told you this
was a waste of time.

27:31.595 --> 27:32.905
Shut up, man.

27:34.095 --> 27:35.812
So alright then,

27:35.814 --> 27:36.981
what do we do?

27:38.740 --> 27:40.088
I need your help.

27:41.105 --> 27:44.128
I need something personal
from your beloved.

27:46.090 --> 27:47.340
Hey, that's all?

27:48.557 --> 27:50.423
Yeah of course.

27:50.425 --> 27:54.393
Just I need something that
belonged to the dead person

27:54.395 --> 27:56.423
to make a connection.

27:56.425 --> 27:57.475
You got it.

28:07.405 --> 28:09.583
This is mine.

28:09.585 --> 28:10.888
Don't take it.

28:14.005 --> 28:15.138
He gave it to me.

28:17.675 --> 28:20.063
Well it might mysteriously
end up in your pocket.

28:20.065 --> 28:21.453
What?

28:21.455 --> 28:23.213
Well you're
always taking my pens.

28:23.215 --> 28:25.233
Are you fucking serious?

28:25.235 --> 28:26.393
I lend you my pen

28:26.395 --> 28:27.463
and you never gave me it back.

28:27.465 --> 28:29.413
You must have about 50 of my pens.

28:29.415 --> 28:31.265
Shut the fuck up, sit down.

28:37.737 --> 28:38.654
Go on then.

28:55.772 --> 28:59.006
We all need to join hands, please.

28:59.008 --> 29:00.083
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I'm not holding his hand.

29:00.085 --> 29:01.693
There needs to be a circle.

29:01.695 --> 29:03.588
Take my hand and do the job.

29:11.715 --> 29:13.745
We wish to speak with the soul of...

29:15.505 --> 29:17.798
Yeah Frank, Frank Shaw.

29:19.225 --> 29:23.068
We wish to speak with the
soul of Frank, Frank Shaw.

29:34.132 --> 29:35.715
Frank, is that you?

30:12.372 --> 30:14.550
Bastard.

30:14.552 --> 30:16.552
You Yorkshire bastard.

30:21.612 --> 30:22.445
Tariq.

30:24.295 --> 30:25.873
Hey Trev, nice stereo,

30:25.875 --> 30:26.903
did you nick it?

30:26.905 --> 30:27.833
Fucking hell, Boxy,

30:27.835 --> 30:29.733
not all Nick stuff.

30:29.735 --> 30:31.273
You do.

30:31.275 --> 30:32.337
Yeah.

30:35.267 --> 30:36.517
Here Trevor, customers.

30:38.325 --> 30:39.398
How are you love?

30:40.525 --> 30:41.925
I've just got 40.

30:44.492 --> 30:47.147
Well that's okay.

30:47.149 --> 30:48.816
Till tomorrow, okay?

31:02.895 --> 31:05.203
That's weak shit that is, Trevor.

31:05.205 --> 31:06.855
Thanks for the feedback, Tariq.

31:08.512 --> 31:09.343
Anyway...

31:09.345 --> 31:10.733
Anyway, hand over the money,

31:10.735 --> 31:11.885
we haven't got all day.

31:13.175 --> 31:14.625
It's already done and left.

31:16.145 --> 31:17.934
Fuck are you on about?

31:17.936 --> 31:20.410
Frank collected a couple of hours ago.

31:20.412 --> 31:22.052
What?

31:22.054 --> 31:23.034
It was a side job.

31:23.036 --> 31:26.293
Frank turned up and said he
was collecting this week.

31:26.295 --> 31:27.578
Bit weak at all since
the fireworks went off.

31:30.841 --> 31:32.412
Whoa boys, watch the wheels.

31:33.305 --> 31:35.183
Where is the money?

31:35.185 --> 31:36.529
I swear,

31:36.531 --> 31:38.329
to Frank.

31:38.331 --> 31:40.752
Frank's.

31:40.754 --> 31:44.333
Actually fuck yeah, sorry yeah,

31:44.335 --> 31:47.378
yeah you did say, he did
say he was collecting.

31:49.115 --> 31:49.946
He didn't say that to me.

31:49.948 --> 31:51.625
Well he told me, I forgotten it.

31:58.815 --> 32:00.665
See you later, you stuffed bastard.

32:04.318 --> 32:05.818
Yorkshire bastard.

32:10.365 --> 32:12.008
Bastard, fucking knew it.

32:13.776 --> 32:15.473
He's making a play without us.

32:15.475 --> 32:16.983
Playing what?

32:16.985 --> 32:20.298
That's 10, 15
grand he's pocketed at least.

32:21.805 --> 32:23.233
Frank wouldn't do that.

32:23.235 --> 32:25.658
Frank's gonna do it and
run of with the money.

32:26.720 --> 32:27.551
No way.

32:27.553 --> 32:28.533
Frank's gonna take that cash

32:28.535 --> 32:30.585
and leave us to deal with my crazy uncle.

32:32.925 --> 32:34.483
Frank's like my dad

32:34.485 --> 32:36.955
and Tracey, they just wouldn't.

32:41.528 --> 32:45.543
It's our job to do the collections.

32:45.545 --> 32:46.998
You said so yourself.

32:49.125 --> 32:50.906
So who's Uday gonna come looking for

32:50.908 --> 32:52.458
once the cash goes missing, eh?

32:58.435 --> 32:59.955
Look, all I'm saying is that

33:01.715 --> 33:05.458
we find Frank, we ask him
what the fuck he's playing at?

33:07.195 --> 33:08.645
Surely you can see that Boxy.

33:13.135 --> 33:13.968
I suppose so.

33:16.975 --> 33:17.808
Good.

33:19.775 --> 33:22.792
See, Frank's not the only
one who's got your back.

33:26.201 --> 33:27.373
And another thing,

33:27.375 --> 33:29.558
I've never called you a mini knob.

33:34.019 --> 33:35.193
I swear Boxy, the shit we've been through,

33:35.195 --> 33:37.238
we're practically brothers.

33:38.298 --> 33:39.962
Brothers, you and me?

33:39.964 --> 33:41.393
Yeah because I'm the only
one trying to save our skins,

33:41.395 --> 33:42.323
not Frank.

33:42.325 --> 33:44.068
Well if we're brothers and all that.

34:14.465 --> 34:16.572
Take them ski masks off.

34:17.895 --> 34:20.273
No wait, I don't want to see your faces.

34:20.275 --> 34:23.038
Get back in your box, mystic meg.

34:26.665 --> 34:28.578
Well look who it is.

34:29.875 --> 34:33.902
Mr. Shiny suit and mini knob.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.922
Sounds like Frank.

34:35.925 --> 34:37.130
Frank?

34:37.132 --> 34:39.438
Take 'em off or this
conversation's over.

34:44.884 --> 34:49.884
God, I'd almost forgotten
how ugly you are, Boxy.

34:51.844 --> 34:53.283
Me and Tracey used to say

34:53.284 --> 34:54.993
your mother never gave birth to you,

34:54.995 --> 34:58.693
she shat you out like
a slippery little turd.

34:58.695 --> 34:59.693
That is definitely Frank.

34:59.695 --> 35:00.788
Fuck you Boxy.

35:03.425 --> 35:05.903
As if you haven't done enough?

35:05.905 --> 35:09.343
You drowned me in that stinking canal.

35:09.345 --> 35:11.343
He put a bullet in Tracey

35:11.345 --> 35:12.933
and then the pair of
you dragged me back here

35:12.935 --> 35:14.418
like I'm your fucking puppet.

35:15.684 --> 35:19.138
You couldn't even let me rest in peace.

35:20.615 --> 35:22.578
Where's the money, Frank?

35:24.905 --> 35:25.738
Ah...

35:26.945 --> 35:29.488
This was your plan, was it, Tariq?

35:32.865 --> 35:36.198
I might've known it had been yours.

35:37.549 --> 35:38.382
Well...

35:39.515 --> 35:41.562
Well you're just an amateur

35:43.415 --> 35:45.068
in a shiny suit.

35:47.105 --> 35:49.083
That's disrespectful that is, Frank.

35:49.085 --> 35:50.773
It is kind of shiny.

35:50.775 --> 35:51.863
Fuck off.

35:51.865 --> 35:53.488
The money, where is it?

35:55.759 --> 35:58.179
You haven't thought
this through, have you?

35:58.181 --> 35:59.931
How are you gonna make me tell you?

36:02.014 --> 36:03.164
Are you gonna shoot me?

36:04.625 --> 36:05.925
'Cause here's the problem,

36:06.905 --> 36:08.988
I'm already dead.

36:25.228 --> 36:28.311
Not so fucking amateur now.

36:31.449 --> 36:33.703
I always knew you were a fucking snake.

36:33.705 --> 36:35.734
Lucy's fine Frank, I promise.

36:35.736 --> 36:37.308
You hurt one hair on her head...

36:37.310 --> 36:40.313
What, what are you gonna
do, Frank, eh, haunt me?

36:40.315 --> 36:41.783
I love that bitch, Boxy.

36:41.785 --> 36:43.493
I know, I know you do, Frank.

36:43.495 --> 36:46.068
So please, just tell
us where the money is.

37:23.040 --> 37:26.253
Hey Frank, what's it like having tits?

37:26.255 --> 37:27.086
You should know, Boxy,

37:27.088 --> 37:29.392
you've got a cracking pair there yourself.

37:29.394 --> 37:30.783
Can I touch 'em?

37:30.785 --> 37:31.741
Fuck off.

37:42.045 --> 37:44.853
You should've told
us where the money was.

37:44.855 --> 37:46.330
Yeah I was gonna.

37:46.332 --> 37:48.510
But you drowned me before I had the chance

37:48.512 --> 37:52.063
you big dumb fucking ape.

37:52.065 --> 37:53.968
Yeah he's right you know.

37:53.970 --> 37:54.801
What do you mean?

37:54.803 --> 37:55.634
- Oh fuck off Boxy!
- It's your life.

37:55.636 --> 37:56.793
If it wasn't for you,

37:56.795 --> 37:58.303
we wouldn't be in this
fucking shit now, would we?

37:58.305 --> 37:59.880
Oh, it's my fault, is it?

38:01.075 --> 38:05.403
Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't
fuck yourselves over it!

38:05.405 --> 38:08.428
This being dead luck, it ain't too shabby.

38:09.645 --> 38:10.719
I'll tell you what,

38:10.721 --> 38:11.552
I get to go anywhere I want now.

38:11.554 --> 38:13.534
You won't believe the things I've seen.

38:13.536 --> 38:15.033
Like what?

38:15.035 --> 38:17.108
Like what really goes on in bedrooms.

38:19.335 --> 38:20.640
Like you see everything?

38:20.642 --> 38:22.098
Yeah course I do.

38:25.085 --> 38:27.503
But you don't watch like
homos doing it, do you?

38:27.505 --> 38:28.990
Oh for fuck's sake, Boxy,

38:28.992 --> 38:31.423
are you still obsessed with cock?

38:31.425 --> 38:33.361
Has he not tried it on
with you yet, Tariq?

38:33.363 --> 38:34.437
Oh fuck off Frank.

38:34.439 --> 38:36.355
Take it, have you seen the size of it?

38:40.722 --> 38:41.555
As if.

39:09.270 --> 39:12.603
You wanted to know where the money is.

39:13.774 --> 39:16.213
You bought a travel agent?

39:16.215 --> 39:17.453
Stop messing Frank.

39:17.455 --> 39:19.468
I spent it on a cruise.

39:19.470 --> 39:22.263
You spent 15 grand on a cruise?

39:22.265 --> 39:23.433
You're lying.

39:23.435 --> 39:25.879
To be fair, it wasn't just any cruise.

39:25.881 --> 39:26.712
Well where you going?

39:26.714 --> 39:28.088
Where were we going?

39:29.545 --> 39:32.003
It was an
around the world cruise.

39:32.005 --> 39:34.533
Cut the shit, Frank, where's the money?

39:34.535 --> 39:39.208
Do you remember Tracey,
Tariq, my beloved wife?

39:42.095 --> 39:43.888
Stage four lung cancer.

39:50.365 --> 39:52.008
Why didn't you say?

39:53.321 --> 39:54.988
I didn't want to worry you, Box.

39:58.047 --> 40:01.428
She'd always wanted to go on a cruise,

40:03.195 --> 40:04.798
the love boat, she called it.

40:06.619 --> 40:08.183
I kept saying I'd take her

40:08.185 --> 40:10.053
but I was always too busy

40:10.055 --> 40:11.568
hoping you'd get rich.

40:15.555 --> 40:17.263
I'm sorry Frank.

40:17.265 --> 40:18.533
Go get the money.

40:18.535 --> 40:20.085
How am I supposed to do that?

40:22.065 --> 40:22.923
Sorry boys,

40:22.925 --> 40:24.958
the fact is we were flying out today.

40:27.645 --> 40:29.233
So it's gone?

40:29.235 --> 40:30.753
Yeah.

40:30.755 --> 40:32.783
So you might as well let Lucy go

40:32.785 --> 40:35.428
and I can let this silly
cow have her body back.

40:43.815 --> 40:45.288
Tariq, what you doing?

40:46.295 --> 40:47.645
Don't do anything stupid.

41:10.195 --> 41:12.593
Come on then, Tariq, get on with it.

41:12.595 --> 41:13.873
What are you doing?

41:13.875 --> 41:14.983
No Tariq, stop!

41:14.985 --> 41:18.038
Bloody cock, he'll find you again.

41:18.040 --> 41:20.125
Shoot me, Tariq, shoot me.

41:20.127 --> 41:22.258
You don't have the balls, do you?

41:37.944 --> 41:41.063
This is what happens
when you're left alone.

41:41.065 --> 41:44.383
This is why you're fucking amateurs,

41:44.385 --> 41:47.438
getting your knickers in
a twist about 15 grand.

41:48.887 --> 41:50.123
You should be thinking

41:50.125 --> 41:51.938
about where the 100 grand is.

41:55.539 --> 41:57.503
What are you on about?

41:57.505 --> 41:59.623
You thought with me out the way

41:59.625 --> 42:02.368
you'd be stepping into my shoes.

42:04.305 --> 42:06.863
Uday's, never gonna give you that,

42:06.865 --> 42:07.768
we both know it.

42:09.191 --> 42:10.775
You might be family

42:12.185 --> 42:14.718
but he treats you like shit.

42:24.315 --> 42:25.848
What's this underground then?

42:28.575 --> 42:29.715
Let me tell you

42:31.465 --> 42:33.353
how our friends

42:33.355 --> 42:36.073
in the Polish immigrant
community do business.

42:36.075 --> 42:39.553
As you know they're our main competitors

42:39.555 --> 42:41.253
for the drug trade in Bradford

42:41.255 --> 42:43.363
and its surrounding districts.

42:43.365 --> 42:47.998
So how do they get their
money back to the motherland?

42:55.635 --> 42:57.833
Each month, they collect cash

42:57.835 --> 42:59.615
from their various distributors

43:05.265 --> 43:07.135
which is then counted,

43:07.137 --> 43:10.386
changed into large denomination notes.

43:26.375 --> 43:27.742
Taken to the airport

43:29.585 --> 43:34.308
and handed over to a sympathetic
airline professional.

43:43.232 --> 43:45.763
The cash is then flown to Krakow

43:45.765 --> 43:48.205
where it lives happily ever after

43:49.655 --> 43:52.778
except for when you two get to it first.

43:54.645 --> 43:57.043
Robbing Jenak's mob'll be suicide.

43:57.045 --> 44:00.035
Yeah, you're right
Tariq but everybody knows

44:01.065 --> 44:04.898
that Janek and Uday have a
special business relationship.

44:06.565 --> 44:07.843
Janek would have to assume

44:07.845 --> 44:10.033
that it was a couple
of adventurous junkies

44:10.035 --> 44:11.158
on an outside job.

44:12.478 --> 44:14.263
I don't know, Frank.

44:14.265 --> 44:15.288
It sounds risky.

44:16.475 --> 44:17.573
When does it happen?

44:17.575 --> 44:18.463
I'm not sure.

44:18.465 --> 44:20.532
Well what fucking good is that then?

44:20.534 --> 44:22.698
Alright, calm down Tariq.

44:23.706 --> 44:26.209
As I explained,

44:26.211 --> 44:28.453
I'm the all seeing eye these days.

44:28.455 --> 44:29.423
Just give me a few hours

44:29.425 --> 44:30.828
and I'll go and find out.

44:33.135 --> 44:34.763
Well hop off then.

44:34.765 --> 44:37.403
I want a guarantee that Lucy gets a cut

44:37.405 --> 44:38.805
so I know she's comfortable.

44:40.665 --> 44:41.498
Deal.

44:42.385 --> 44:44.903
You swear it Boxy, I don't trust him.

44:44.905 --> 44:45.738
I swear Frank,

44:46.654 --> 44:48.453
Lucy'll get a cut.

44:48.455 --> 44:49.288
Good.

44:57.995 --> 45:00.093
Please don't harm me, please.

45:00.095 --> 45:02.785
I swear I won't tell anyone.

45:02.787 --> 45:04.870
Please let me go, please.

45:31.307 --> 45:32.140
Hold on.

45:42.216 --> 45:43.358
It's Frank bloody Shaw.

45:46.658 --> 45:48.453
This is gonna get messy.

45:48.455 --> 45:49.873
This is all we need right now.

45:49.875 --> 45:50.708
Yeah.

45:51.703 --> 45:53.203
A bloody gang war.

45:55.462 --> 45:56.295
Right.

46:01.117 --> 46:02.210
Where you going?

46:02.212 --> 46:04.470
Time to rattle a few cages.

46:04.472 --> 46:05.305
Come on.

46:17.153 --> 46:17.984
Thomas Smart,

46:17.986 --> 46:18.817
Thomas Smart and Donna Brown

46:18.819 --> 46:19.861
on their way to school in Birkenshire

46:19.863 --> 46:21.273
are thought to be the first victims

46:21.275 --> 46:24.113
of notorious serial killer Charles Sunday.

46:24.115 --> 46:25.848
I hope that fucker burns in hell.

46:31.485 --> 46:32.318
Go on then.

46:34.419 --> 46:35.498
Is there a hell?

46:39.785 --> 46:41.866
It's not like in the bible.

46:41.868 --> 46:46.408
The spirits of the dead are
all around us all the time.

46:50.385 --> 46:51.552
What, like now?

46:57.413 --> 46:59.033
And it was these spirits

46:59.035 --> 47:00.835
that told you where these kids were?

47:04.527 --> 47:06.204
Something like that.

47:10.545 --> 47:13.208
Tracey wants you to know
it wasn't your fault.

47:23.957 --> 47:25.363
For fuck's sake Boxy,

47:25.365 --> 47:27.903
you look like you've
swallowed a bucket of cum.

47:27.905 --> 47:28.738
Frank?

47:29.839 --> 47:30.770
Tariq.

47:30.772 --> 47:32.728
What?

47:32.730 --> 47:34.538
The money's being moved tomorrow.

47:37.440 --> 47:40.738
The one place we know he's
got to go is the airport.

47:42.335 --> 47:46.713
Our courier always parks
here in this multistory.

47:46.715 --> 47:48.732
We'll take it
in the airport car park.

47:48.734 --> 47:50.463
The exchange always
takes place after hours

47:50.465 --> 47:51.463
so it'll be quiet.

47:51.465 --> 47:53.278
Yeah cameras?

47:53.280 --> 47:54.580
Just one on every level.

47:55.772 --> 47:58.483
We'll park near the
entrance of the car park,

47:58.485 --> 47:59.370
follow him inside

47:59.372 --> 48:01.272
and take him when he gets out the car?

48:02.751 --> 48:03.658
Right.

48:04.805 --> 48:05.955
If he's carrying money,

48:06.985 --> 48:10.188
he's going to be carrying something else.

48:14.905 --> 48:16.593
No, it's a gun.

48:16.595 --> 48:17.426
It's the barrel.

48:17.428 --> 48:18.393
He's at the airport.

48:18.395 --> 48:19.639
If he's carrying anything,

48:19.641 --> 48:20.873
he'll have to leave it in the car.

48:20.875 --> 48:22.403
Right.

48:22.405 --> 48:24.543
Now Boxy, I need you to get some wheels,

48:24.545 --> 48:25.878
something anonymous.

48:26.745 --> 48:27.945
Yeah, yeah as long as I can drive it.

48:27.947 --> 48:28.778
What?

48:28.780 --> 48:29.623
You know the getaway car?

48:29.625 --> 48:30.543
You can drive the car.

48:30.545 --> 48:31.378
Now,

48:32.312 --> 48:33.428
are we set?

48:36.675 --> 48:38.263
This better work Frank.

48:38.265 --> 48:40.468
You do as I say and it will.

48:41.375 --> 48:43.790
Let's hope so, for Lucy's sake.

48:43.792 --> 48:46.542
No, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank.

48:47.865 --> 48:49.313
Lucy's fine.

48:49.315 --> 48:51.546
I took her some food on the way over.

48:51.548 --> 48:53.633
You can't leave her in that shed.

48:53.635 --> 48:55.393
Just give me five minutes
with her Box, please.

48:55.395 --> 48:57.143
Not till the job's done.

48:57.145 --> 48:59.368
Box, she needs me, please.

49:02.745 --> 49:04.745
Look, let's just have a game of poker.

49:05.594 --> 49:06.638
Like old times.

49:09.775 --> 49:11.093
I'm going to bed.

49:11.095 --> 49:12.965
You two can keep in here.

49:16.345 --> 49:17.783
Prick's probably forgotten how to play.

49:17.785 --> 49:19.935
He's missed that many
card nights recently.

49:23.475 --> 49:25.378
I'll give you a game, Box, your deal.

49:27.015 --> 49:30.363
Aces on the flop, nice.

49:30.365 --> 49:32.160
Fuck all, again.

49:32.162 --> 49:33.911
Blaggy Box,

49:33.913 --> 49:36.023
how many times have I told you,

49:36.025 --> 49:38.338
look like a winner and the losers'll fold.

49:40.035 --> 49:42.183
I've never been a winner though, Frank.

49:42.185 --> 49:44.308
Each hand is a lesson, lad.

49:45.215 --> 49:46.776
In cards and in life.

49:46.778 --> 49:48.553
I never seem to learn though.

49:48.555 --> 49:49.905
Well that's fucking true.

49:51.519 --> 49:53.493
Few cards short of the deck.

49:53.495 --> 49:56.603
Split the pack and
left half behind, mate.

49:56.605 --> 49:57.966
Sod off.

50:03.818 --> 50:05.735
You're alright, Boxy.

50:06.925 --> 50:09.192
And that's coming from
the man you murdered.

50:20.864 --> 50:22.614
It was an accident.

50:24.026 --> 50:24.859
I know.

50:35.961 --> 50:37.544
I want to fix it.

50:42.635 --> 50:44.252
You can't.

50:44.254 --> 50:46.004
I'm such a fuck up.

50:48.861 --> 50:50.322
Closest thing I've ever had to father...

50:50.324 --> 50:53.407
We all make mistakes, son, even me.

51:23.067 --> 51:23.900
Lucy!

51:33.191 --> 51:34.915
Good morning, love.

51:34.917 --> 51:37.167
How could you let that
bastard do this to me?

51:38.821 --> 51:40.738
I loved you like a son.

51:49.973 --> 51:51.258
Fuck you doing?

51:52.630 --> 51:54.533
Couldn't sleep.

51:54.535 --> 51:56.873
Boxy's having nightmares.

51:56.875 --> 51:58.075
Sleep in the bathroom.

52:01.215 --> 52:03.453
You sleep alright, Tariq?

52:03.455 --> 52:05.358
Yeah, like a baby.

52:51.115 --> 52:51.948
Come.

52:55.965 --> 52:57.642
Inspector Wilkes,

52:59.345 --> 53:00.678
welcome to the circus.

53:01.815 --> 53:03.993
To what do I owe this honour?

53:03.995 --> 53:07.173
Frank Shaw, we fished him
out of the canal yesterday

53:07.175 --> 53:09.783
and when we went to tell
his poor wife the sad news

53:09.785 --> 53:11.747
we found a bullet in her head.

53:11.749 --> 53:14.943
But you wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

53:14.945 --> 53:18.293
You're right, I know
nothing about it at all,

53:18.295 --> 53:19.368
very sad news.

53:20.541 --> 53:22.868
But I don't understand
why you're telling me.

53:24.236 --> 53:26.013
We thought you might be interested

53:26.015 --> 53:28.303
given that he managed your drug operation

53:28.305 --> 53:30.288
across every white estate in the city.

53:31.265 --> 53:33.865
Okay please just hold
that thought for one minute.

53:38.275 --> 53:39.108
Oh fuck.

53:45.775 --> 53:47.072
Okay good, get off.

53:53.805 --> 53:56.238
So where were we?

53:58.035 --> 54:00.028
Oh yes, you said something about drugs.

54:01.685 --> 54:05.428
It's an awful thing, this drugs business.

54:06.765 --> 54:08.923
I see it on TV what it does to people,

54:08.925 --> 54:10.533
families,

54:10.535 --> 54:13.088
women selling themselves
to pay for their habit,

54:13.995 --> 54:17.473
little orphans running
around stealing shit,

54:17.475 --> 54:19.473
babies addicted at birth

54:19.475 --> 54:21.123
with their faces all fucked up.

54:21.125 --> 54:23.908
It's awful, awful.

54:26.415 --> 54:29.825
And I'm deeply offended

54:30.785 --> 54:32.983
that you police always think

54:32.985 --> 54:34.785
I have something to do with this

54:35.765 --> 54:39.928
disgusting scud on our society.

54:43.015 --> 54:44.933
It's because I'm Asian, isn't it?

54:44.935 --> 54:46.058
It's actually racist.

54:47.235 --> 54:48.613
I think that your informants

54:48.615 --> 54:53.615
need to start attending
Ku Klux Klub meetings.

54:54.585 --> 54:55.488
Ku Klux Klan?

54:56.484 --> 54:57.728
Ku Klux Klub.

54:59.745 --> 55:00.578
Ku Klux Klan.

55:03.355 --> 55:04.188
Ku Klux

55:07.170 --> 55:08.003
clit.

55:11.568 --> 55:13.596
Ku Klux Klan.

55:13.598 --> 55:14.848
Ku Klux Klan.

55:18.895 --> 55:20.553
Okay.

55:20.555 --> 55:21.386
Thanks for your time.

55:21.388 --> 55:22.221
Any time.

55:24.875 --> 55:25.975
I'll see myself out.

55:45.828 --> 55:46.661
All out!

55:48.826 --> 55:49.663
I want that shit of a nephew

55:49.665 --> 55:52.458
and his fucking psychic
back here in pieces.

55:56.782 --> 55:58.532
Fucking do something!

56:14.798 --> 56:15.763
I thought you told him

56:15.765 --> 56:17.378
to steal something anonymous.

57:15.661 --> 57:17.661
These fucking tickets.

57:19.074 --> 57:20.741
I hate these things.

57:23.351 --> 57:25.351
Can't fucking reach it.

57:26.877 --> 57:27.708
What's that?

57:27.710 --> 57:28.588
The ticket.

57:28.590 --> 57:29.788
And?

57:29.790 --> 57:31.709
I'm not paying for it.

57:31.711 --> 57:33.465
You'll pay for it.

57:33.467 --> 57:35.467
It's your fucking car.

57:58.535 --> 58:00.813
So what are we supposed
to be waiting for?

58:00.815 --> 58:04.608
Like I said, he's driving
a white Audi four by four.

58:05.875 --> 58:06.953
Half the crims in Bradford

58:06.955 --> 58:08.943
drive white Audi four by fours.

58:08.945 --> 58:11.695
But not every crim's packing
it in tonight, are they?

58:22.417 --> 58:23.800
Time for a piss.

58:23.802 --> 58:24.781
Fuck's sake, Boxy.

58:24.783 --> 58:25.942
Hold it in, Boxy lad.

58:29.485 --> 58:30.755
Oh here we go.

58:41.128 --> 58:42.083
See, I told you.

58:42.085 --> 58:42.985
Just follow him.

59:14.967 --> 59:15.798
What do we do?

59:15.800 --> 59:17.280
Stick it over there on the left.

59:17.282 --> 59:20.325
Tariq, you take me in, I've got to see.

59:20.327 --> 59:21.160
Okay.

59:38.572 --> 59:39.405
Okay.

59:46.777 --> 59:48.573
Oh these stink?

59:48.575 --> 59:49.713
Did you get new ones?

59:49.715 --> 59:50.546
I didn't have time.

59:50.548 --> 59:54.146
Shut the fuck up and
remember quick and quiet.

59:54.148 --> 59:55.883
Quick and quiet, quick and quiet.

59:55.885 --> 59:57.302
Okay, here we go.

01:00:29.179 --> 01:00:31.596
Janek, it's me, it's Tariq.

01:00:33.953 --> 01:00:35.036
It's me, man.

01:00:47.298 --> 01:00:52.298
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:00:54.479 --> 01:00:57.032
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:00:58.831 --> 01:01:00.248
Wait, wait, wait.

01:01:01.847 --> 01:01:03.847
Wait, it's me Tariq man.

01:01:07.979 --> 01:01:10.255
The money's in the
other car, the other car.

01:01:10.257 --> 01:01:11.856
The case, get the case.

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:18.171
Hey.

01:01:57.088 --> 01:01:57.919
I forgot the ticket.

01:01:57.921 --> 01:02:00.192
I swear, if we get out of this alive,

01:02:00.194 --> 01:02:03.088
I'm gonna fucking kill you, Boxy.

01:02:14.653 --> 01:02:16.070
Robbing bastards.

01:02:22.101 --> 01:02:22.934
Fuck.

01:02:25.761 --> 01:02:27.844
Come on, Tariq.

01:02:32.572 --> 01:02:33.489
Ugh fuck!

01:02:34.555 --> 01:02:35.888
Janek!

01:02:51.455 --> 01:02:53.058
Now get in the fucking car.

01:02:56.314 --> 01:02:59.888
Come on, get in, fucking get in!

01:03:09.805 --> 01:03:11.248
Nice job boys, slick.

01:03:12.305 --> 01:03:17.305
Fuck you, Frank.

01:03:27.484 --> 01:03:28.315
I think you'd better thank Boxy

01:03:28.317 --> 01:03:29.938
for saving your ass flaps.

01:03:31.375 --> 01:03:33.333
Now we need to lie low

01:03:33.335 --> 01:03:35.002
and I know just the place.

01:03:59.945 --> 01:04:02.073
What's this, Frank?

01:04:02.075 --> 01:04:03.848
Looks like a pink unicorn.

01:04:07.855 --> 01:04:10.093
It's not my fault you two fuck ups

01:04:10.095 --> 01:04:12.793
couldn't rob candy from a baby.

01:04:15.085 --> 01:04:16.785
Fuck you, don't touch me!

01:04:17.865 --> 01:04:19.286
Who's side you on anyway?

01:04:19.288 --> 01:04:21.743
What you doing Tariq?

01:04:21.745 --> 01:04:22.898
Hey that's my knife.

01:04:24.090 --> 01:04:25.341
What?

01:04:25.343 --> 01:04:26.443
You can't help yourself can you?

01:04:26.445 --> 01:04:27.868
I knew you were gonna keep it.

01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:29.740
We're a day away from
ending up in the canal

01:04:29.742 --> 01:04:31.703
and all you can think about is this knife.

01:04:31.705 --> 01:04:32.713
It's my knife.

01:04:32.715 --> 01:04:34.398
Actually it's my knife.

01:04:36.485 --> 01:04:37.348
Look Tariq,

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:42.243
I've got an emergency stash.

01:04:42.245 --> 01:04:43.940
Let Boxy go

01:04:43.942 --> 01:04:45.408
and I'll take you to it.

01:04:47.755 --> 01:04:48.958
Stop lying Frank.

01:04:50.465 --> 01:04:52.088
Hey I'm old school.

01:04:53.125 --> 01:04:55.438
We're always taught to keep
your stash hidden away.

01:04:59.972 --> 01:05:01.853
How much?

01:05:01.855 --> 01:05:03.793
Maybe enough to stop Uncle Uday

01:05:03.795 --> 01:05:05.688
from chopping your fucking head off.

01:05:08.855 --> 01:05:10.798
If you're lying Frank,

01:05:11.705 --> 01:05:13.662
I'm gonna gut Lucy in front of you.

01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:20.913
Don't you ever put a
knife to my throat again.

01:05:20.915 --> 01:05:22.363
Have you got me, Tariq?

01:05:22.365 --> 01:05:25.133
Alright Boxy, alright.

01:05:25.135 --> 01:05:26.210
Right,

01:05:26.212 --> 01:05:28.347
we're gonna go with Frank,

01:05:28.349 --> 01:05:31.103
he's gonna tell us where the money is

01:05:31.105 --> 01:05:32.205
and then we're sorted.

01:05:36.069 --> 01:05:38.923
You know I'd never hurt you, right?

01:05:38.925 --> 01:05:39.756
And another thing

01:05:39.758 --> 01:05:41.445
give me my fucking knife.

01:05:51.728 --> 01:05:53.358
I want their families dead.

01:05:54.225 --> 01:05:56.529
I want their pets dead.

01:05:56.531 --> 01:05:57.413
I want the guy

01:05:57.415 --> 01:05:59.713
who delivers their online
supermarket shopping dead

01:05:59.715 --> 01:06:02.938
and I want those diamonds
back here tonight.

01:06:03.975 --> 01:06:05.398
Do you understand me?

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:06.817
Yes boss.

01:06:07.665 --> 01:06:09.415
Now I have it from a good source

01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:14.353
that Janek and his people
were all over that car park.

01:06:14.355 --> 01:06:16.895
So we start with their car washes yeah?

01:06:16.897 --> 01:06:18.195
Yes boss.

01:06:18.197 --> 01:06:19.028
Yeah?

01:06:19.030 --> 01:06:20.447
Yes boss.

01:06:21.825 --> 01:06:22.658
Go.

01:06:23.934 --> 01:06:24.767
Go.

01:06:59.325 --> 01:07:01.808
I told you to go straight on.

01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:03.593
Are you deaf as well as stupid?

01:07:03.595 --> 01:07:04.533
We're gonna go get Lucy.

01:07:04.535 --> 01:07:05.673
She stays in the boot of the car

01:07:05.675 --> 01:07:06.506
until we get the money

01:07:06.508 --> 01:07:08.155
and if you're lying Frank, I swear.

01:07:36.524 --> 01:07:37.857
Janek, friend,

01:07:41.154 --> 01:07:44.660
I'm gonna ask you one more time

01:07:44.662 --> 01:07:46.858
where are my fucking diamonds?

01:08:02.916 --> 01:08:05.352
One more time, one more time,

01:08:05.354 --> 01:08:07.098
where are the diamonds?

01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:08.681
One more time, tell me, tell me.

01:08:38.866 --> 01:08:39.698
Woo!

01:10:19.885 --> 01:10:21.648
Where the fuck is it?

01:10:22.535 --> 01:10:23.366
Why don't you just put it

01:10:23.368 --> 01:10:25.395
like every fucker else?

01:10:25.397 --> 01:10:26.230
Here.

01:10:27.295 --> 01:10:28.128
Here?

01:10:29.945 --> 01:10:30.778
Under there.

01:10:33.235 --> 01:10:34.883
You got a shovel?

01:10:34.885 --> 01:10:35.785
It's in the car.

01:10:37.205 --> 01:10:40.338
Well then Tariq, off you trot.

01:11:10.205 --> 01:11:11.428
Do you remember Tyrone?

01:11:12.625 --> 01:11:13.833
Who?

01:11:13.835 --> 01:11:16.363
Kid with long hair, speech impediment.

01:11:16.365 --> 01:11:19.355
Yeah Tyrone, that's right, condoms.

01:11:21.361 --> 01:11:23.373
Do you know that he loaded
a condom full of smack?

01:11:23.375 --> 01:11:25.723
Yeah, went through
customs and it exploded.

01:11:25.725 --> 01:11:27.173
They're still cleaning shit off walls

01:11:27.175 --> 01:11:28.903
in Manchester Airport.

01:11:28.905 --> 01:11:32.163
Hey, Falcon said his eyes
nearly bulged out of his head,

01:11:32.165 --> 01:11:32.996
how 'bout that?

01:11:33.831 --> 01:11:34.662
Shouldn't laugh really.

01:11:34.664 --> 01:11:36.083
Oh, and did you see

01:11:36.085 --> 01:11:38.312
that Chinese girl from Birkenshire.

01:11:38.314 --> 01:11:39.523
What did you used to call her?

01:11:39.525 --> 01:11:40.398
Loco Ono.

01:11:41.537 --> 01:11:42.773
A fucking character.

01:11:42.775 --> 01:11:43.608
Right bastard.

01:11:55.925 --> 01:11:57.902
Fuck are you looking at?

01:12:18.605 --> 01:12:20.783
Hey guess who I've seen shagging?

01:12:20.785 --> 01:12:21.693
Oh who?

01:12:21.695 --> 01:12:22.933
Wills and Kate.

01:12:22.935 --> 01:12:24.033
Oh you ain't?

01:12:24.035 --> 01:12:26.356
Uday and that weather girl up Tariq.

01:12:26.358 --> 01:12:28.533
I knew it, I told him that.

01:12:28.535 --> 01:12:29.368
Yeah Tariq

01:12:31.715 --> 01:12:32.628
and your Dawn.

01:12:40.485 --> 01:12:42.013
They're at it all the fucking time,

01:12:42.015 --> 01:12:43.368
they're like rabbits.

01:12:45.535 --> 01:12:46.368
No way.

01:12:47.325 --> 01:12:50.123
Just think for once in your life Boxy,

01:12:50.125 --> 01:12:52.423
why hasn't he been coming to poker?

01:12:52.425 --> 01:12:53.875
He never used to miss a game.

01:12:54.735 --> 01:12:55.813
He said he got business.

01:12:55.815 --> 01:12:57.915
Yeah, yeah he has got business,

01:12:57.917 --> 01:12:59.658
shagging your Dawn.

01:13:00.722 --> 01:13:03.253
No, I don't believe you, Frank.

01:13:03.255 --> 01:13:05.083
Look, Frank, just stop, right,

01:13:05.085 --> 01:13:05.916
it's not honest, this.

01:13:05.918 --> 01:13:10.198
Dawn didn't seem that keen
to go away with you, did she?

01:13:12.705 --> 01:13:14.098
No I don't believe you.

01:13:15.201 --> 01:13:16.513
Well let's find out.

01:13:16.515 --> 01:13:17.768
Why don't you ask him?

01:13:19.885 --> 01:13:20.718
Ask him what?

01:13:21.635 --> 01:13:22.466
It don't matter,

01:13:22.468 --> 01:13:23.299
just leave it, alright?

01:13:23.301 --> 01:13:24.132
What's he been saying?

01:13:24.134 --> 01:13:26.236
Do you want this money or not?

01:13:26.238 --> 01:13:27.069
Give me the shovel.

01:13:27.071 --> 01:13:27.904
Fucking dig.

01:13:51.722 --> 01:13:53.152
Mind what you're doing man?

01:13:53.154 --> 01:13:55.487
I'm standing here, you dick.

01:13:59.812 --> 01:14:01.043
You fucking dickhead,

01:14:01.045 --> 01:14:03.483
you just threw it at my fucking suit.

01:14:03.485 --> 01:14:05.115
Fucking pay for it, man.

01:14:06.815 --> 01:14:07.799
Whoa!

01:14:07.801 --> 01:14:09.413
Are you fucking my Dawn?

01:14:09.415 --> 01:14:10.853
What's he been saying?

01:14:10.855 --> 01:14:11.686
That's bullshit, man.

01:14:11.688 --> 01:14:13.597
Are you shagging Dawn?

01:14:13.599 --> 01:14:15.403
That's bollocks, man,
it's the last bullet.

01:14:15.405 --> 01:14:16.493
He sees things.

01:14:16.495 --> 01:14:17.704
He's seen you both doing it.

01:14:17.706 --> 01:14:19.593
I've not slept with
your girlfriend, man,

01:14:19.595 --> 01:14:21.053
what are you on about?

01:14:21.055 --> 01:14:22.803
I'm gonna shoot you in the fucking face.

01:14:22.805 --> 01:14:24.305
Wait Boxy, wait,

01:14:25.395 --> 01:14:26.773
what would prove it man?

01:14:26.775 --> 01:14:29.103
Oh yeah, that's right Boxy,

01:14:29.105 --> 01:14:32.033
you two, you're practically brothers

01:14:32.035 --> 01:14:35.263
except when he's got a
knife to your throat.

01:14:35.265 --> 01:14:38.013
Oh, and when Dawn's with him,

01:14:38.015 --> 01:14:39.755
she takes it up the ass.

01:14:41.713 --> 01:14:44.391
This is all your fucking fault.

01:14:44.393 --> 01:14:46.060
Fucking stupid dick!

01:14:59.276 --> 01:15:00.912
Fuck.

01:15:07.678 --> 01:15:08.811
Please don't do this, Frank, please.

01:15:08.813 --> 01:15:09.803
You killed me.

01:15:09.805 --> 01:15:12.253
You murdered my wife

01:15:12.255 --> 01:15:13.888
and you kidnapped my Lucy.

01:15:14.788 --> 01:15:19.788
Imagine Tariq, if you will,
how I might be feeling?

01:15:20.105 --> 01:15:21.203
Forget the money, Frank.

01:15:21.205 --> 01:15:23.085
This was never about the money.

01:15:23.087 --> 01:15:27.237
Sorry please, I'm begging you, please.

01:15:27.239 --> 01:15:28.322
It wasn't me.

01:15:29.930 --> 01:15:31.263
Boxy killed you,

01:15:32.175 --> 01:15:34.616
he killed Tracey, not me.

01:15:34.618 --> 01:15:35.618
Oh really?

01:15:36.644 --> 01:15:37.894
In that case...

01:15:50.995 --> 01:15:52.538
God that feels good.

01:16:02.095 --> 01:16:03.298
I'm sorry Boxy lad.

01:16:04.868 --> 01:16:06.608
This was never part of the plan.

01:16:09.335 --> 01:16:12.828
I'll look out for you on the other side.

01:16:40.375 --> 01:16:41.983
There's just one more thing Alice

01:16:41.985 --> 01:16:43.318
before you send me back,

01:16:44.475 --> 01:16:48.658
please promise I'll make
it worth your while.

01:17:25.976 --> 01:17:30.976
Lucy, come here, come on, good girl.

01:17:33.135 --> 01:17:38.135
Oh yes, you're daddy's
Mr. Special little girl.

01:17:38.583 --> 01:17:40.824
Who's this?

01:17:40.826 --> 01:17:42.476
Have they been looking after you?

01:17:44.336 --> 01:17:47.212
Daddy's gonna have to
give you to somebody else

01:17:48.735 --> 01:17:51.678
to look after, yeah.

01:17:53.805 --> 01:17:55.033
Alice, you've got to promise me.

01:17:55.035 --> 01:17:57.485
You've got to swear that
you'll take care of her.

01:17:58.575 --> 01:17:59.408
Swear it.

01:18:00.785 --> 01:18:01.618
Course Frank.

01:18:03.685 --> 01:18:05.738
Lucy will have a loving home for life.

01:18:07.375 --> 01:18:10.568
Now, it's time for you to go.

01:18:13.455 --> 01:18:15.512
Just give me five more minutes.

01:18:17.441 --> 01:18:18.274
Please.

01:18:22.446 --> 01:18:23.613
Goodbye Frank.

01:19:01.169 --> 01:19:03.693
Inspector Wilkes, are the
streets of Bradford safe?

01:19:03.695 --> 01:19:05.723
There is no official
statement being released

01:19:05.725 --> 01:19:07.043
- at this time.
- Are the streets of Bradford

01:19:07.045 --> 01:19:07.876
safe?

01:19:07.878 --> 01:19:08.792
We need to know,

01:19:10.322 --> 01:19:12.083
No comment.

01:19:12.085 --> 01:19:14.878
Excuse me, please, excuse me.

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:16.386
Out of the way, thank you.

01:19:16.388 --> 01:19:18.041
- Answer our question.
- Please answer.

01:19:18.043 --> 01:19:18.874
No comment.

01:19:18.876 --> 01:19:20.602
Got two more.

01:19:20.604 --> 01:19:22.354
Christ, no comment.

01:19:24.104 --> 01:19:24.935
Seriously

01:19:24.937 --> 01:19:26.343
about whether West Yorkshire's streets

01:19:26.345 --> 01:19:27.703
are safe or not from gun crime.

01:19:27.705 --> 01:19:29.193
We'll let you know.

01:19:29.195 --> 01:19:30.379
Back to the studio.

01:19:56.502 --> 01:19:58.952
Tomorrow, it'll start brightening up

01:19:58.954 --> 01:20:02.604
and we'll have

01:20:02.606 --> 01:20:05.551
and tomorrow will be cooler and drier

01:20:05.553 --> 01:20:07.553
for Friday and Saturday.

01:20:08.573 --> 01:20:10.377
Thanks Joe

01:20:10.379 --> 01:20:12.517
and now back to our
main story this evening,

01:20:12.519 --> 01:20:13.541
a violent gang war

01:20:13.543 --> 01:20:16.199
has broken out on the streets of Bradford.

01:20:16.201 --> 01:20:17.512
Two men have been shot and killed

01:20:17.514 --> 01:20:19.943
at a shoot out in a multistory car park

01:20:19.945 --> 01:20:21.457
and two further bodies
have been discovered

01:20:21.459 --> 01:20:23.280
in a local cemetery.

01:20:23.282 --> 01:20:25.239
All the shootings are
thought to be gang related

01:20:25.241 --> 01:20:27.443
and part of a deadly struggle for control

01:20:27.445 --> 01:20:29.977
of the illegal drug
trade in West Yorkshire.

01:20:29.979 --> 01:20:32.288
With police resources
stretched to breaking points

01:20:32.290 --> 01:20:34.218
and a rising tide of gun crime,

01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:37.927
we've been asking are the
streets of Bradford safe?

01:20:37.929 --> 01:20:39.968
It's a question our reporter Sophie Walker

01:20:39.970 --> 01:20:42.778
tried to put to the officer
in charge of the investigation

01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:44.101
earlier today.

01:20:44.103 --> 01:20:45.808
No official statement is
to be made at this time.

01:20:45.810 --> 01:20:48.370
We need to know are West
Yorkshire's streets safe?

01:20:48.372 --> 01:20:51.073
- We need to know.
- No comment, no comment.

01:20:51.075 --> 01:20:52.074
Whether they're safe or not.

01:20:52.076 --> 01:20:53.110
Will you please?

01:20:53.112 --> 01:20:55.512
As you can see there
is no official comment

01:20:55.514 --> 01:20:56.673
from West Yorkshire police

01:20:56.675 --> 01:20:58.142
but as soon as we know something

01:20:58.144 --> 01:20:59.500
about whether West Yorkshire's streets

01:20:59.502 --> 01:21:01.247
are safe or not from gun crime,

01:21:01.249 --> 01:21:02.088
we'll let you know.

01:21:02.090 --> 01:21:03.673
Back to the studio.

01:21:32.089 --> 01:21:32.922
Help me.

01:21:34.007 --> 01:21:35.728
Are you gonna help me Alice?

01:21:35.730 --> 01:21:37.616
Help me get the bastard who did this.

01:21:37.618 --> 01:21:38.958
Sorry love.

01:21:43.985 --> 01:21:46.000
You can't afford me.
