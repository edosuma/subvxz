WEBVTT

00:00.042 --> 00:02.417
Previously, on "Below Deck."

00:02.417 --> 00:04.417
Tell us who you would like
to make out with at the table.

00:04.417 --> 00:07.083
Whoa!

00:07.083 --> 00:08.083
Yes!

00:08.083 --> 00:09.501
Jess, Jess, Jess!

00:09.501 --> 00:12.167
Woo!

00:12.167 --> 00:14.083
I could show him a thing or two.

00:14.083 --> 00:16.626
Co-primaries, Jeremy Morton
and Ronnie Weiss.

00:16.626 --> 00:18.542
They would like
to invite me to dinner.

00:18.542 --> 00:21.542
Ronnie will be celebrating
his 75th birthday

00:21.542 --> 00:23.375
with an '80s dance
and fitness party.

00:23.375 --> 00:25.292
Hello!

00:25.292 --> 00:27.959
This is not the group that you
would think you'd see together.

00:27.959 --> 00:29.959
Here's to the staff
of the My Seanna.

00:29.959 --> 00:33.375
Woo!

00:33.375 --> 00:35.501
Jess is just, like,
moping around as if,

00:35.501 --> 00:38.209
like, she's pure misery.

00:38.209 --> 00:40.709
How was your night last night?

00:40.709 --> 00:42.501
I'm old.
You're not old.

00:42.501 --> 00:47.667
I'm feeling it, though.

00:47.667 --> 00:48.667
It's cushions,
cushions, cushions.

00:48.667 --> 00:50.459
[bleep]

00:50.459 --> 00:51.626
The deck team needs more time
to get everything secured.

00:51.626 --> 00:53.542
They had plenty of time.

00:53.542 --> 00:56.417
They were standing up here for
15 minutes, pulling the anchor.

00:56.417 --> 00:58.250
If Eddie doesn't drop
the hammer on them,

00:58.250 --> 01:00.042
I'm gonna drop it on him.

01:00.042 --> 01:02.459
I'm just so ----ing frustrated
with getting yelled at.

01:02.459 --> 01:22.417
That's ----ing bullsh--.

01:22.417 --> 01:24.459
So, from now on,
whenever we get underway,

01:24.459 --> 01:26.042
I want everything secured.

01:26.042 --> 01:28.334
The wind here is just
too ----ing strong.

01:28.334 --> 01:29.584
I'm sick of it all.

01:29.584 --> 01:31.709
From now on, we do not
give Captain Lee

01:31.709 --> 01:34.042
the go-ahead until
everything is secured,

01:34.042 --> 01:36.375
meaning fenders,
cushions, everything.

01:36.375 --> 01:39.918
I want things covered, I want
this never to happen again.

01:39.918 --> 01:40.918
-Yes, copy.
-Okay.

01:40.918 --> 01:42.167
-Great.
-Yeah, agreed.

01:42.167 --> 01:44.501
I need the deck team
to step it up,

01:44.501 --> 01:47.918
so that I can start focusing
on my job as first officer,

01:47.918 --> 01:49.959
and my education
in the wheelhouse.

01:49.959 --> 01:51.292
They need to get their
sh-- together.

01:51.292 --> 01:52.667
I don't want another
----ing thing

01:52.667 --> 01:55.209
falling off this boat, copy?

01:55.209 --> 01:56.250
-Copy.
-Yes, copy.

01:56.250 --> 01:57.375
Great.

01:57.375 --> 01:59.501
The whole thing is just unreal.

01:59.501 --> 02:07.083
Mm, best thing I've
ever ate in my life.

02:07.083 --> 02:08.083
Oh.

02:08.083 --> 02:09.459
Okay, let's do it.

02:09.459 --> 02:11.626
Whew, chile.

02:11.626 --> 02:17.667
I hate this pair of pants.

02:17.667 --> 02:21.000
-Yeah.
-They are?

02:21.000 --> 02:22.334
Are we going somewhere?

02:22.334 --> 02:23.417
To do some fun
water sports later, yeah.

02:23.417 --> 02:27.417
Very cool.

02:27.417 --> 02:28.417
[phone ringing]

02:28.417 --> 02:29.751
Craft services.

02:29.751 --> 02:31.626
This is Heather from
motor yacht Seanna.

02:31.626 --> 02:34.959
We've got an '80s birthday
party, so I'm looking

02:34.959 --> 02:38.959
to get some neon décor,
and some balloons,

02:38.959 --> 02:42.417
the numbers seven and five.

02:42.417 --> 02:44.626
Thank you so much, Paige,
I appreciate it.

02:44.626 --> 02:47.250
Oh, this ain't bad.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.584
Watch how it gets folded out
as we unfold this thing,

02:49.584 --> 02:50.584
because that's how
it's gonna go back.

02:50.584 --> 02:52.250
Tonight is '80s night.

02:52.250 --> 02:54.375
Oh, I'm gonna do
the vacuum cleaner.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.000
Oh, are you holding the cord?

02:56.000 --> 02:57.292
We'll go and do the jet-skis,

02:57.292 --> 02:59.334
and we'll leave Rayna
to pump this up.

02:59.334 --> 03:01.209
Just hit it to
the end of the line.

03:01.209 --> 03:03.083
Maybe we'll tie it on now,
in case it blows away.

03:03.083 --> 03:04.417
Okie-dokie.

03:04.417 --> 03:05.542
-Good morning.
-Morning.

03:05.542 --> 03:07.751
Cheffy.
How you doing, sweetie?

03:07.751 --> 03:10.042
-Good, how are you doing?
-I'm fine.

03:10.042 --> 03:12.501
Tonight should be a blast,

03:12.501 --> 03:16.167
'80s theme party
for Ronnie's 75th birthday.

03:16.167 --> 03:17.959
I know, you don't
have to dress up.

03:17.959 --> 03:19.000
I mean, I did 'em once,
that was plenty.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.417
Yeah.

03:20.417 --> 03:21.417
That's when I met
Mary Anne, mid-'80s.

03:21.417 --> 03:23.083
Changed my life.

03:23.083 --> 03:24.417
That's what I was
doing in the '80s...

03:24.417 --> 03:26.417
changing my life and
trying to look cool,

03:26.417 --> 03:28.250
but it didn't work out so well.

03:28.250 --> 03:31.584
I gotta go downstairs and burn
stuff, so I will see you later.

03:31.584 --> 03:33.250
All right, sweetie,
thank you so much.

03:33.250 --> 03:34.667
-Have a wonderful day.
-Everything else going good?

03:34.667 --> 03:36.459
Yeah, I think so.

03:36.459 --> 03:41.125
How is my girl Jess doing?

03:41.125 --> 03:43.042
Her grandma had
to get a procedure done,

03:43.042 --> 03:46.042
so it seemed like something at
home was weighing on her mind.

03:46.042 --> 03:48.042
Her spirits
just always seem down.

03:48.042 --> 03:50.501
With Jessica, I can
notice the difference

03:50.501 --> 03:53.459
from day one being
on the boat to right now.

03:53.459 --> 03:56.292
I love doing laundry,
I really do.

03:56.292 --> 03:58.250
I haven't heard someone
say that in years.

03:58.250 --> 04:00.125
Oh [bleep] my life.

04:00.125 --> 04:02.292
Yeah, definitely just
wanna lift her spirits.

04:02.292 --> 04:05.417
I understand what Jess has got
going on with her grandparents,

04:05.417 --> 04:07.459
but at some point she kinda
needs to leave that stuff

04:07.459 --> 04:10.292
in her cabin and show up to do
the job she's here to do.

04:10.292 --> 04:12.542
I'll pop by once
we get more of an idea

04:12.542 --> 04:13.584
of what the day looks like.

04:13.584 --> 04:15.083
I'll be here.

04:15.083 --> 04:16.584
-Just watch it from...
-I will.

04:16.584 --> 04:17.584
...where you swing it forward.

04:17.584 --> 04:19.083
All right.

04:19.083 --> 04:22.542
-Nice, good.
-Now I'm gonna luff up.

04:22.542 --> 04:27.083
Okay, winching down.

04:27.083 --> 04:28.417
Who wants to do water sports?

04:28.417 --> 04:30.042
I do!

04:30.042 --> 04:31.417
All right, I'm gonna
do the quesadilla,

04:31.417 --> 04:33.375
and then after that
I'm gonna knock into

04:33.375 --> 04:35.125
the chicken, beef, and then...

04:35.125 --> 04:36.584
Cool, I'm gonna start
cutting jalapenos and limes.

04:36.584 --> 04:38.292
Everybody wants a Mexican lunch.

04:38.292 --> 04:41.417
I spent a lot of time
in La Paz, Mexico and San Diego.

04:41.417 --> 04:43.250
Mexican is just
right up my alley...

04:43.250 --> 04:45.626
spices, fresh herbs.

04:45.626 --> 04:48.959
Mexican food's great coming in,

04:48.959 --> 04:50.459
but it's interesting
coming out.

04:50.459 --> 04:53.000
Thank you for calling
motor yacht Seanna.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.667
This is Satan speaking,
how may I direct your call?

04:56.667 --> 04:58.584
All right,
you guys are all good.

04:58.584 --> 05:00.459
-Whoa!
-Oh!

05:00.459 --> 05:06.709
Have fun, man, go for it.

05:06.709 --> 05:13.292
[chattering]

05:13.292 --> 05:17.209
I know.

05:17.209 --> 05:18.542
This is probably
the best day of his life.

05:18.542 --> 05:22.083
Woo!

05:22.083 --> 05:23.083
I'll give it a wipe-down.

05:23.083 --> 05:24.751
Look at how bad that looks.

05:24.751 --> 05:26.334
I hope I don't hold
anyone's hand any time soon.

05:26.334 --> 05:27.918
My hands do as well.
Stunning, isn't it?

05:27.918 --> 05:30.584
How are there not
suitors knocking at my door?

05:30.584 --> 05:32.083
Are you missing your partner?

05:32.083 --> 05:33.375
Our relationship has
always been based

05:33.375 --> 05:35.083
around yachting as the priority.

05:35.083 --> 05:36.626
Of course I miss him,

05:36.626 --> 05:38.417
but it's something that
we're definitely used to.

05:38.417 --> 05:40.292
Sure, I've discovered
that's what it is, babe.

05:40.292 --> 05:42.250
I'm craving male attention.

05:42.250 --> 05:44.083
Are you ready for that?

05:44.083 --> 05:46.459
I wasn't for about
three years, but now I am.

05:46.459 --> 05:48.959
My first relationship lasted
for about two and a half years,

05:48.959 --> 05:50.709
and that was
the love of my life.

05:50.709 --> 05:52.459
He was 10 years older than me,

05:52.459 --> 05:53.709
and we were going through
very different stages

05:53.709 --> 05:56.042
in our lives,
so it had to end.

05:56.042 --> 05:59.125
It absolutely shattered me.

05:59.125 --> 06:02.459
Consequently, I'm not prone
to opening myself up,

06:02.459 --> 06:04.792
but I guess if I keep going
with this approach,

06:04.792 --> 06:07.584
I'm going to shrivel up and be
single for the rest of my life.

06:07.584 --> 06:10.250
So, I feel like
I'm ready to get back into it

06:10.250 --> 06:11.584
and explore what's
out there.

06:11.584 --> 06:12.959
You're ready to be swept
off your feet?

06:12.959 --> 06:14.292
Yeah, I really am.

06:14.292 --> 06:23.375
I'm ready to give
my all, you know?

06:23.375 --> 06:24.584
Got the quesas ready to roll.

06:24.584 --> 06:26.042
Ready when you are.

06:26.042 --> 06:28.250
Come sit next to
your mommy, dreamboat.

06:28.250 --> 06:29.542
Should I serve those
with a spoon?

06:29.542 --> 06:30.542
Yes, please.

06:30.542 --> 06:31.959
These are your taco trays.

06:31.959 --> 06:33.417
I've got tortillas down
here at the end.

06:33.417 --> 06:35.125
These are queso fundidos.

06:35.125 --> 06:36.626
Stop it, girl!

06:36.626 --> 06:38.292
We're just gonna keep
bringing everything up.

06:38.292 --> 06:39.292
Did I hear something about
a lobster quesadilla?

06:39.292 --> 06:40.417
They're coming.

06:40.417 --> 06:41.751
Ronnie, it's your birthday.

06:41.751 --> 06:42.751
How old are you,
tell me the truth.

06:42.751 --> 06:43.751
Eighty-one.

06:43.751 --> 06:46.042
-Oh, God.
-Wow.

06:46.042 --> 06:47.459
-Please, I hope not.
-Alexander!

06:47.459 --> 06:51.417
This chef, she is a freak
of nature, this woman.

06:51.417 --> 06:53.083
If this girl wanted
to start a restaurant,

06:53.083 --> 06:54.792
it would be a huge success.

06:54.792 --> 06:56.292
This might be
the best lunch I ever had.

06:56.292 --> 06:57.584
Mm!

06:57.584 --> 06:59.083
These are not
jalapenos, are they?

06:59.083 --> 07:00.417
[bleep] me, I have no idea
what that is.

07:00.417 --> 07:01.792
These are rotten.

07:01.792 --> 07:03.459
-Heather, Heather, Eddie.
-Go ahead.

07:03.459 --> 07:04.459
We have a provision boat here.

07:04.459 --> 07:05.792
Copy, I'm on my way.

07:05.792 --> 07:06.792
Straight inside, yeah?

07:06.792 --> 07:09.417
Oh, yeah.

07:09.417 --> 07:11.125
This is very nice.

07:11.125 --> 07:15.626
I'm so looking
forward to this '80s party.

07:15.626 --> 07:16.792
Where was I in the '80s?

07:16.792 --> 07:18.667
Man, I was in the womb.

07:18.667 --> 07:21.000
Do I know much about it?
Hell, no.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.626
Can I channel it?
Hell, yeah.

07:23.626 --> 07:25.000
Please tell me
these are leggings.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.292
Anything neon, a little skin.

07:27.292 --> 07:29.375
Jane Fonda, let's go.

07:29.375 --> 07:32.000
Oh, God, these titties
would not fit in here.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.584
At what point is Captain Lee
gonna say we're too naked?

07:34.584 --> 07:36.667
Oh, my God, you did it again.

07:36.667 --> 07:37.709
It's like, this is
the best meal ever.

07:37.709 --> 07:39.417
Ever.

07:39.417 --> 07:40.459
What time would you like
to have dinner this evening?

07:40.459 --> 07:42.083
-7:30.
-Yes, fine.

07:42.083 --> 07:44.584
-How you doing?
-Hungry.

07:44.584 --> 07:46.542
Did you miss lunch?

07:46.542 --> 07:48.250
Yeah, I didn't
really eat as much.

07:48.250 --> 07:51.042
Oh.

07:51.042 --> 07:52.125
Thank you.

07:52.125 --> 07:53.542
All right.

07:53.542 --> 07:55.751
I think Wes and Jess
should definitely hook up.

07:55.751 --> 07:57.709
I think tomorrow
we should make them sit

07:57.709 --> 08:00.709
on their own separate table
when we go have dinner.

08:00.709 --> 08:04.000
Wes has definitely
got no game whatsoever.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.334
Let's see where
I got all the snacks...

08:07.334 --> 08:08.626
Yay.

08:08.626 --> 08:10.459
But I'll try and help him out,

08:10.459 --> 08:12.417
because if he
waits any longer,

08:12.417 --> 08:16.375
he's gonna be going home
with his nuts full.

08:16.375 --> 08:18.250
So I said to him,

08:18.250 --> 08:20.167
"Look, mate, I'm gonna make sure
you sit next to her at dinner."

08:20.167 --> 08:21.501
Nice.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.459
They wait too long
for something to happen.

08:23.459 --> 08:25.209
I don't think I've ever asked
you if you're single.

08:25.209 --> 08:29.000
I sure am.
Sure, sure am.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.375
Hm.

08:30.375 --> 08:35.292
-Lobster quesadilla.
-Oh, my God, no way.

08:35.292 --> 08:37.083
Oh, you just took a sh-- or you
actually dropped them off?

08:37.083 --> 08:38.417
No, I took a massive sh--.

08:38.417 --> 08:40.042
-Okay, good.
-Is that a real saying?

08:40.042 --> 08:41.375
Yeah, you've never
heard that before?

08:41.375 --> 08:42.584
No.

08:42.584 --> 08:43.667
I've just got bowel problems.

08:43.667 --> 08:46.167
He... you...

08:46.167 --> 08:47.417
He sh-- on his girlfriend,
though, before.

08:47.417 --> 08:48.417
No, I didn't sh-- on her.

08:48.417 --> 08:49.959
-You...
-I was...

08:49.959 --> 08:52.125
So, basically, I got out
the shower and I thought

08:52.125 --> 08:56.209
it would be funny to start,
like, twerking on the bed.

08:56.209 --> 08:57.709
So, I was naked on the bed,
and I thought it would be funny

08:57.709 --> 08:59.375
to push out a ----ing
really loud fart.

08:59.375 --> 09:01.125
Oh!

09:01.125 --> 09:02.501
And a ----ing sh-- flew out
and flew through the air.

09:02.501 --> 09:04.167
No ----ing way.

09:04.167 --> 09:09.334
Yeah, and poo just went bewww
across the bedroom.

09:09.334 --> 09:10.542
Oh, well sh-- happens.

09:10.542 --> 09:11.751
Literally.

09:11.751 --> 09:13.375
-Oh!
-Oh!

09:13.375 --> 09:15.542
-Whoa!
-Oh, my God!

09:15.542 --> 09:16.751
Jesus!

09:16.751 --> 09:16.751
-Through the lines!
-Goddamn it!

09:16.751 --> 09:23.709
Previously, on "Below Deck."

09:23.709 --> 09:25.626
Oh, well sh-- happens.

09:25.626 --> 09:26.626
Literally.

09:26.626 --> 09:28.125
Whoa!

09:28.125 --> 09:30.459
Oh!

09:30.459 --> 09:31.459
-Jesus!
-Oh, my God!

09:31.459 --> 09:32.459
Whoa!

09:32.459 --> 09:34.000
What the [bleep]?

09:34.000 --> 09:35.334
-I need someone with me!
-I'm coming!

09:35.334 --> 09:37.209
-What happened?
-The trampoline blew away.

09:37.209 --> 09:41.542
Oh sh-- that's so cool,
somebody get a video of that.

09:41.542 --> 09:43.125
It was cool, though.

09:43.125 --> 09:44.542
It was cool.

09:44.542 --> 09:45.751
-It snapped?
-Yes, it snapped.

09:45.751 --> 09:49.250
This was on the trampoline.

09:49.250 --> 09:52.792
"Baywatch" in action,
you got the Hasselhoff.

09:52.792 --> 09:54.626
Who's the Hoff?
I'm the Hoff.

09:54.626 --> 09:56.542
Or the Rock...
a skinnier version of the Rock.

09:56.542 --> 10:00.459
The Pebble.
They call me Pebble.

10:00.459 --> 10:08.292
That thing launched
with violence.

10:08.292 --> 10:11.459
Yeah...

10:11.459 --> 10:13.125
Jesus, that was so bad.

10:13.125 --> 10:14.250
-Eddie.
-Yes, sir?

10:14.250 --> 10:18.459
Get a pump on it
and suck it out.

10:18.459 --> 10:20.250
Copy that.

10:20.250 --> 10:21.751
Hey, we're lucky there was
no one on that thing.

10:21.751 --> 10:24.042
In 35 years, I've
never seen wind with such

10:24.042 --> 10:26.751
intensity for an extended
period of time like it is.

10:26.751 --> 10:29.167
Mother Nature giving
your ass a wake-up call.

10:29.167 --> 10:30.751
Won't make that mistake again.

10:30.751 --> 10:32.584
Chef Rachel, you have a visitor.

10:32.584 --> 10:34.459
-Hello, sweetheart.
-Everybody loves the food.

10:34.459 --> 10:36.250
Oh, thank you!

10:36.250 --> 10:38.042
Everybody says it's the
best food they've ever had.

10:38.042 --> 10:40.042
For dinner tonight,
they're gonna be having oysters,

10:40.042 --> 10:43.250
shrimp, escargot, and all
of that crazy adult stuff.

10:43.250 --> 10:45.000
Do you wanna do your favorite
chicken fingers again?

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Yes!

10:46.000 --> 10:47.083
Okay, we got it.

10:47.083 --> 10:48.334
It's kinda similar.

10:48.334 --> 10:49.542
Boom.

10:49.542 --> 10:50.626
Sam, can I get you
a drink, please?

10:50.626 --> 10:52.501
I'll do, like, a Shirley Temple.

10:52.501 --> 10:53.751
One Shirley Temple, coming up.

10:53.751 --> 10:54.751
-Yeah, yeah.
-Pull the first one up.

10:54.751 --> 10:56.709
-Yeah.
-[grunting]

10:56.709 --> 11:03.083
-Okay, I'll see you at 5:30.
-Okay.

11:03.083 --> 11:04.751
Good Lord.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.167
-Mom?
-What?

11:06.167 --> 11:07.417
Dad in there, too.

11:07.417 --> 11:10.083
You look like the Joker, Ronnie.

11:10.083 --> 11:12.667
What? What...
what?

11:12.667 --> 11:14.083
Perfect timing.

11:14.083 --> 11:15.042
-Here you go, sir.
-Thank you.

11:15.042 --> 11:19.542
My pleasure.

11:19.542 --> 11:21.042
You're in my department,
I just can't...

11:21.042 --> 11:22.792
I mean, don't take it...
listen...

11:22.792 --> 11:24.334
I put that...
I put that... I...

11:24.334 --> 11:25.459
I put that aside as
soon as we got on.

11:25.459 --> 11:26.459
That's not happening, though.

11:26.459 --> 11:29.375
No, you're...

11:29.375 --> 11:35.083
so it was not supposed
to be included in that.

11:35.083 --> 11:36.334
That's real shot.

11:36.334 --> 11:37.459
You're definitely
gonna wear this.

11:37.459 --> 11:38.459
Excellent.

11:38.459 --> 11:39.709
I have leggings for you.

11:39.709 --> 11:41.083
I'm wearing leggings now?
Wow.

11:41.083 --> 11:42.542
But your T-shirt should be long
enough

11:42.542 --> 11:44.083
just to cover
your tiddly-niddlies.

11:44.083 --> 11:46.083
-Okay.
-Yeah, baby.

11:46.083 --> 11:47.375
I'm gonna jump in the shower.

11:47.375 --> 11:49.584
Oy, I don't wanna
leave tomorrow.

11:49.584 --> 11:57.834
Great crew, captain's hot.

11:57.834 --> 12:01.584
For tonight's '80s theme, that
is definitely '80s steakhouse.

12:01.584 --> 12:03.334
Bone-in ribeye, lobster.

12:03.334 --> 12:04.709
Not today, Satan.

12:04.709 --> 12:07.626
King crab, snow crab,
Ronnie's birthday cake,

12:07.626 --> 12:10.292
and some camel-toe
with the sweatpants.

12:10.292 --> 12:11.292
What the [bleep]?

12:11.292 --> 12:12.542
I love the ----ing '80s.

12:12.542 --> 12:15.125
Oh [bleep], eat my [bleep].

12:15.125 --> 12:19.083
Attention all crew, make sure
you're in your blacks by 6:00.

12:19.083 --> 12:25.417
Heh... "copy."

12:25.417 --> 12:26.501
Jesus.

12:26.501 --> 12:28.417
Keep trying.

12:28.417 --> 12:30.334
Or find something else to wear,
I'm okay with that option too.

12:30.334 --> 12:31.459
Peg your collar.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.125
I kinda left my room in a hurry.

12:33.125 --> 12:34.792
Oh, is it time
to get into blacks?

12:34.792 --> 12:40.083
Yeah.

12:40.083 --> 12:41.250
How is that...
how does it...

12:41.250 --> 12:43.250
-It goes up my ass.
-Jake, wow.

12:43.250 --> 12:46.334
He looks
like a figure-skater.

12:46.334 --> 12:48.667
Can you grab another
barbeque sauce out of the...

12:48.667 --> 12:50.417
Or an exotic dancer.

12:50.417 --> 12:52.417
You don't need to be
dressed till 9:00.

12:52.417 --> 12:56.626
You know, he's just
so effortlessly chic.

12:56.626 --> 12:58.292
Rayna, you want us to help
you pick something out?

12:58.292 --> 13:01.459
Nope, I got it, thank you.

13:01.459 --> 13:04.042
Engineering,
engineering, galley.

13:04.042 --> 13:06.125
Just to let you guys know,
I will be doing

13:06.125 --> 13:08.501
a white pan method,
so it'll create a lot of smoke

13:08.501 --> 13:12.292
in the galley within
two minutes.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.125
[coughing]

13:14.125 --> 13:15.125
Rayna, did you choose something?

13:15.125 --> 13:16.459
No, I have not.

13:16.459 --> 13:19.292
I will, in due time.

13:19.292 --> 13:21.375
I'm just trying to see if
you're excited, that's all.

13:21.375 --> 13:22.626
Just wanna make sure
you've got something.

13:22.626 --> 13:31.000
No, I...
I got you, I'll have something.

13:31.000 --> 13:35.334
I love those glasses.

13:35.334 --> 13:38.959
Beautiful.

13:38.959 --> 13:41.792
Yeah.

13:41.792 --> 13:43.125
Yeah, I am...

13:43.125 --> 13:46.501
19 years older than you.
How old are you?

13:46.501 --> 13:48.250
That's...
that's a good one.

13:48.250 --> 13:49.250
Seventy-five!

13:49.250 --> 13:50.250
Toddy, zip it up.

13:50.250 --> 13:53.667
-One last blow.
-Oh, yeah.

13:53.667 --> 13:56.417
Get that five!

13:56.417 --> 13:58.334
Do you wanna see if the
deck crew can get that?

13:58.334 --> 14:00.501
Deck crew, deck crew, interior.

14:00.501 --> 14:03.167
We just had
a number five take off.

14:03.167 --> 14:05.501
Okay...
Jess, can you call deck crew?

14:05.501 --> 14:09.167
I already did, love.

14:09.167 --> 14:10.834
Just be careful, boo.

14:10.834 --> 14:14.167
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so deck crew
for this, I mean, not for the...

14:14.167 --> 14:15.501
I did not see that.

14:15.501 --> 14:17.417
Deck crew, deck crew,
we also have some glass.

14:17.417 --> 14:22.209
What happened?

14:22.209 --> 14:23.501
We won't be able to get
that balloon back.

14:23.501 --> 14:34.083
-No.
-Cool.

14:34.083 --> 14:36.334
Eddie, if we could use
one of your helps

14:36.334 --> 14:38.334
just to put the plates
on the table at 8:00?

14:38.334 --> 14:40.042
Oh, copy that.

14:40.042 --> 14:41.459
You could get started
in the queen room.

14:41.459 --> 14:43.209
Eddie and the team
are right here.

14:43.209 --> 14:44.542
We're gonna help you get
things on these big plates.

14:44.542 --> 14:46.709
-Is there food at the table?
-No.

14:46.709 --> 14:48.125
We're just sitting.

14:48.125 --> 14:49.209
I mean, it's just
about 8:00, so.

14:49.209 --> 14:51.042
We're just excited to sit.

14:51.042 --> 14:52.334
If you've got deck crew helping,
can I finish that quickly?

14:52.334 --> 14:53.709
-Yeah.
-Let me know if you need me.

14:53.709 --> 14:55.209
And then we're gonna
go ahead and pour

14:55.209 --> 14:56.542
the melted butter
into the containers.

14:56.542 --> 14:57.667
Cheers, thank you.

14:57.667 --> 14:59.584
That's awesome, thank you, guys.

14:59.584 --> 15:01.459
Stay right here, I'm gonna
put the tongs on it.

15:01.459 --> 15:03.167
Ooh, ooh, go slow.

15:03.167 --> 15:05.292
I just wanna know where they
got the '90s theme from.

15:05.292 --> 15:07.459
'80s.

15:07.459 --> 15:13.125
They must have just
saw a picture of you.

15:13.125 --> 15:16.209
-Dear, what is that?
-Whoagee, wow!

15:16.209 --> 15:19.167
-Jesus Christ.
-Whoagee to the next level!

15:19.167 --> 15:20.667
Oh, my whoagee.

15:20.667 --> 15:22.584
We're placing it all in
the middle so you can get

15:22.584 --> 15:24.250
a great photo, and then we're
gonna take it around the table,

15:24.250 --> 15:25.417
family-style, so we'll
offer you everything.

15:25.417 --> 15:27.125
Look at that!

15:27.125 --> 15:28.125
So we're gonna just keep--

15:28.125 --> 15:29.459
You really got it going on.

15:29.459 --> 15:30.626
-Good evening.
-Good evening!

15:30.626 --> 15:32.292
Tender is the lobster.

15:32.292 --> 15:33.501
Happy birthday, sir.

15:33.501 --> 15:34.751
Thank you, Lee!

15:34.751 --> 15:36.459
-Captain.
-Captain Lee!

15:36.459 --> 15:37.709
No, he didn't.

15:37.709 --> 15:39.375
He's so busy
with this lobster.

15:39.375 --> 15:40.667
It's his birthday,
he's allowed to do

15:40.667 --> 15:42.125
whatever the hell
he feels like doing

15:42.125 --> 15:43.125
-You better believe it.
-That's right.

15:43.125 --> 15:44.792
I like that sentiment.

15:44.792 --> 15:46.959
Potatoes are ready to go.

15:46.959 --> 15:48.292
Could I offer you
a fresh dinner roll?

15:48.292 --> 15:50.959
-Wow.
-Potatoes.

15:50.959 --> 15:52.334
I'm gonna grab some
serving utensils.

15:52.334 --> 15:57.584
Wow.

15:57.584 --> 16:02.250
It's Heather's job to know
where her tongs are at, period.

16:02.250 --> 16:03.584
As a deckhand, I'm helping you.

16:03.584 --> 16:05.250
I work outside, boo.

16:05.250 --> 16:07.083
Fraser, Fraser, Heather.

16:07.083 --> 16:09.167
Could I get you to come up
and assist with service?

16:09.167 --> 16:10.334
Copy that, coming now.

16:10.334 --> 16:15.667
Oh, I smell the truffle.

16:15.667 --> 16:17.459
Somebody take a picture of
this gorgeous mushroom.

16:17.459 --> 16:24.083
This is one gorgeous
mushroom, right here.

16:24.083 --> 16:32.083
I've got these tongs.

16:32.083 --> 16:33.584
Like, there's no point
to set it on the table

16:33.584 --> 16:35.250
if we can't serve it.

16:35.250 --> 16:37.042
Just leave it on the bar,
leave it on the bar.

16:37.042 --> 16:40.459
What, do you want me to just
grab it with my bare hands?

16:40.459 --> 16:42.292
This just isn't
what five-star service is,

16:42.292 --> 16:44.417
and I shouldn't have
to explain that.

16:44.417 --> 16:46.584
Oh, my God, is that
a cowboy steak?

16:46.584 --> 16:49.125
Coming up...

16:49.125 --> 16:50.751
So, I just wanna stage
you right here.

16:50.751 --> 16:52.709
I guess this is what being
a first officer is all about.

16:52.709 --> 16:55.250
I'm wearing leggings
and a tank top

16:55.250 --> 16:58.334
that belongs
to an 11-year-old girl.

16:58.334 --> 16:58.334
Happy birthday!

16:58.334 --> 17:02.375
Oh, well sh-- happens.

17:02.375 --> 17:03.709
I've got these tongs.

17:03.709 --> 17:05.417
Yeah, let's go.

17:05.417 --> 17:08.417
These are the only ones, like,
we have only one...

17:08.417 --> 17:10.459
There's no point to set it on
the table if we can't serve it.

17:10.459 --> 17:12.209
Just leave it on the bar,
leave it on the bar.

17:12.209 --> 17:14.459
I hate the way
that this is going.

17:14.459 --> 17:16.626
I'm just not thrilled
that nobody

17:16.626 --> 17:19.501
had the initiative
to come up with a solution.

17:19.501 --> 17:22.584
Jess, could I get you to come
up and water the table, please?

17:22.584 --> 17:24.501
Copy.

17:24.501 --> 17:25.751
If I say bring service ware up,
they'll say there is none.

17:25.751 --> 17:27.167
Go find some.

17:27.167 --> 17:28.876
Here is your bone-in ribeye,

17:28.876 --> 17:30.751
marinated with a
little bit of cognac,

17:30.751 --> 17:32.709
a peppercorn rub, along
with a Maldon salt.

17:32.709 --> 17:34.709
-It's amazing.
-Can I get a picture of that?

17:34.709 --> 17:36.417
Oh, yeah, I'll get one for us.

17:36.417 --> 17:39.209
It's seriously the sickest
thing you ever saw.

17:39.209 --> 17:41.501
Would you like a piece of steak?

17:41.501 --> 17:50.792
It's your birthday!

17:50.792 --> 17:52.876
[coughing]

17:52.876 --> 17:54.626
I just almost choked to death,

17:54.626 --> 17:58.375
and you just were going
about your lobster.

17:58.375 --> 17:59.792
It was just a cluster[bleep].

17:59.792 --> 18:02.083
Oh, my God,
that's like Fred Flintstone.

18:02.083 --> 18:03.834
-Oh, my God. Go!
-That's right, eat it.

18:03.834 --> 18:05.584
-Get into it!
-He's a caveman.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.751
Does that just look like
the worst service on my part

18:07.751 --> 18:10.250
in front of Captain Lee
and everyone else?

18:10.250 --> 18:13.167
There's nothing like
the meat off the bone.

18:13.167 --> 18:14.167
It's the best meal.

18:14.167 --> 18:15.709
I agree with you.

18:15.709 --> 18:17.334
Everyone's got food,
that's all that matters.

18:17.334 --> 18:18.751
We need to rent the boat
for, like, a month.

18:18.751 --> 18:20.626
-Rent what boat?
-This one.

18:20.626 --> 18:22.501
Oh.

18:22.501 --> 18:25.501
All crew, if you guys
wanna get into your '80s attire

18:25.501 --> 18:27.501
so we can sing
"Happy Birthday."

18:27.501 --> 18:32.501
Ooh, '80s attire!

18:32.501 --> 18:34.209
Obviously.

18:34.209 --> 18:36.042
I'm probably done.
I had two and a half pieces.

18:36.042 --> 18:38.042
-Done, done?
-Yeah.

18:38.042 --> 18:46.125
Rachel, Rachel, Heather,
I'm clearing the table.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.876
What, the pants underneath?

18:47.876 --> 18:51.375
[laughing]

18:51.375 --> 18:52.876
It's in there, isn't it?

18:52.876 --> 18:54.375
Can someone confirm
with me that Rachel

18:54.375 --> 18:56.626
knows I am clearing the table?

18:56.626 --> 18:57.834
Who's got the Budweisers?

18:57.834 --> 18:59.876
Exactly!

18:59.876 --> 19:02.209
Someone on the radio,
anyone on the radio?

19:02.209 --> 19:04.584
Oh, you look
like Freddie Mercury.

19:04.584 --> 19:05.667
I think you look good.

19:05.667 --> 19:08.501
Oh, we all look so cool.

19:08.501 --> 19:09.542
Did somebody come
communicate with you?

19:09.542 --> 19:10.667
-No, why?
-No one?

19:10.667 --> 19:12.250
No.

19:12.250 --> 19:13.834
Oh, my ----ing God,
I've called three times,

19:13.834 --> 19:15.542
can someone confirm
that Rachel knows

19:15.542 --> 19:17.250
I've been clearing the table.

19:17.250 --> 19:19.209
Don't come up,
I don't want them to see anyone

19:19.209 --> 19:20.375
until we have the cake.

19:20.375 --> 19:21.459
Right.
Do we just...

19:21.459 --> 19:23.209
do you want us to help
with...

19:23.209 --> 19:24.542
No, she doesn't want
anybody to come up there.

19:24.542 --> 19:25.584
So, why are we
being summoned, then?

19:25.584 --> 19:27.209
-I have no idea.
-What's...

19:27.209 --> 19:28.542
What's she ----ing
asking about, then?

19:28.542 --> 19:30.125
I'm gonna take 'em
into the ring,

19:30.125 --> 19:31.542
and I'm gonna break 'em
over my knee!

19:31.542 --> 19:34.375
Oh, yeah, brother!

19:34.375 --> 19:35.501
You wanna change, and then
we can stand by on this?

19:35.501 --> 19:36.709
Yeah.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.375
Guys, can we line up
in the hallway?

19:38.375 --> 19:41.542
All right, let's do it.

19:41.542 --> 19:43.459
All right, two seconds.

19:43.459 --> 19:45.375
-How old are you?
-I'm 25.

19:45.375 --> 19:47.083
He's just short.

19:47.083 --> 19:51.334
Happy birthday, happy ----ing
birthday, happy birthday

19:51.334 --> 19:52.667
Oh, my God, that's awesome.

19:52.667 --> 19:54.501
Easy does it, there are kids
in the house.

19:54.501 --> 19:56.459
My dad had a great voice,
he was...

19:56.459 --> 19:58.042
-Wow, well, so do you.
-Yeah.

19:58.042 --> 20:03.042
♪ Happy birthday to you

20:03.042 --> 20:07.626
♪ Happy birthday to you

20:07.626 --> 20:12.792
Woo!

20:12.792 --> 20:15.125
It's your birthday, hey!

20:15.125 --> 20:17.792
Woo-hoo!

20:17.792 --> 20:19.792
I guess this is what being
a first officer is all about.

20:19.792 --> 20:22.042
One, two, three...

20:22.042 --> 20:23.375
Yeah!

20:23.375 --> 20:25.417
I'm wearing leggings
and a tank top

20:25.417 --> 20:28.042
that belongs to
a 11-year-old girl.

20:28.042 --> 20:30.501
What a luxurious
promotion this is.

20:30.501 --> 20:32.209
That was amazing.

20:32.209 --> 20:34.125
I mean, you can't get
better than that.

20:34.125 --> 20:36.584
Can I just tell you this...
best carrot cake of my life.

20:36.584 --> 20:39.667
Wow, Chef Rachel, amazing.

20:39.667 --> 20:41.125
Chef Rachel.

20:41.125 --> 20:42.584
I had so many bests
on this trip.

20:42.584 --> 20:44.584
This is my best wig
I've ever had.

20:44.584 --> 20:47.417
-It is looking pretty good.
-It is.

20:47.417 --> 20:49.083
Rayna, are you done?

20:49.083 --> 20:50.292
A quarter to 6:00, you just
help with the gym stuff.

20:50.292 --> 20:51.292
Yeah.

20:51.292 --> 20:52.751
Well, thank you guys for dinner.

20:52.751 --> 20:55.250
-Oh, my God, thank you!
-Thank you for joining us.

20:55.250 --> 20:57.250
Charter three
dinner service is done.

20:57.250 --> 20:58.375
Yes!

20:58.375 --> 20:59.459
Ugh!

20:59.459 --> 21:01.083
Good night.

21:01.083 --> 21:02.209
I think I'll go to bed.

21:02.209 --> 21:03.709
Jess, go down for the night.

21:03.709 --> 21:05.209
Yes, ma'am.

21:05.209 --> 21:06.417
You'll be on the floor
by 6:00 a.m.

21:06.417 --> 21:13.667
Oh, my God.

21:13.667 --> 21:17.083
----ing hell.

21:17.083 --> 21:19.334
Mm-hmm.

21:19.334 --> 21:21.125
Yeah, no, I hear you.

21:21.125 --> 21:22.292
So grateful for the deck
team's help, but it was like,

21:22.292 --> 21:26.626
don't bring me food...

21:26.626 --> 21:28.083
When is she gonna
find out when she's the one

21:28.083 --> 21:29.375
who ----ed everything up?

21:29.375 --> 21:34.375
Is this a normal habit
for your ass?

21:34.375 --> 21:37.501
You did kind of snap on me for
something that's your job,

21:37.501 --> 21:40.542
do you get what I'm saying?

21:40.542 --> 21:43.250
-Oh.
-I'm done.

21:43.250 --> 21:46.125
I've got my whole baked potato
bakin' in these bad boys.

21:46.125 --> 21:48.167
Go let some steam outta
that thing

21:48.167 --> 21:52.334
or you're gonna make some mash.

21:52.334 --> 21:58.042
[snoring]

21:58.042 --> 21:59.334
Sorry I've been short,
it's just been crazy.

21:59.334 --> 22:08.209
No, I get it.

22:08.209 --> 22:09.667
Yeah.

22:09.667 --> 22:12.167
I really wanna get to the bottom
of this issue with Jess.

22:12.167 --> 22:13.501
This isn't a test.

22:13.501 --> 22:15.667
Either you wanna be here,
or you don't.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.250
Now it's affecting
my whole team,

22:17.250 --> 22:19.083
because it's adding
more to your plate,

22:19.083 --> 22:20.334
which then adds
more to my plate.

22:20.334 --> 22:22.167
If you have one bad apple,

22:22.167 --> 22:25.626
it's only a matter of time
till it rots the whole tree.

22:25.626 --> 22:28.667
Coming up...

22:28.667 --> 22:30.334
Jake coming on a little strong.

22:30.334 --> 22:32.667
The 'stache looks prettier
and prettier every day.

22:32.667 --> 22:33.834
Fluff your hair.

22:33.834 --> 22:35.334
-Hello.
-It's laying too flat.

22:35.334 --> 22:35.334
[laughing]

22:35.334 --> 22:42.209
I've got these tongs.

22:42.209 --> 22:46.501
[alarm sounds, yawning]

22:46.501 --> 22:54.292
Oh, my ----ing neck.

22:54.292 --> 23:00.250
Ruh-roh.

23:00.250 --> 23:04.709
Oh, I miss you.

23:04.709 --> 23:10.209
Ugh, I don't wanna go
to work today.

23:10.209 --> 23:13.375
Yachting and relationships
are like oil and water.

23:13.375 --> 23:14.375
How can you be in a
relationship with someone

23:14.375 --> 23:15.834
if you're never there?

23:15.834 --> 23:17.667
But I like to feel
the feeling of knowing that,

23:17.667 --> 23:20.626
like, someone genuinely
wants to talk to you.

23:20.626 --> 23:24.083
I shouldn't be tired like
this, but I don't know.

23:24.083 --> 23:25.626
Honestly...

23:25.626 --> 23:27.626
I'm not trying to
rush into anything right now,

23:27.626 --> 23:29.751
but I still reach
out for that,

23:29.751 --> 23:32.417
like, attention, if
that makes sense, yeah.

23:32.417 --> 23:35.125
I can't believe I just
----ing admitted that.

23:35.125 --> 23:38.375
All right, papi.

23:38.375 --> 23:40.792
Yeah, papi, I'll text you.

23:40.792 --> 23:41.792
Bye.

23:41.792 --> 23:43.501
Are you hurting today?

23:43.501 --> 23:45.501
Oh, my God, everything hurts.

23:45.501 --> 23:47.501
I am the body ache.

23:47.501 --> 23:49.542
Google image that sh--.
My face will come up.

23:49.542 --> 23:53.667
Body aches, see "Rachel."

23:53.667 --> 23:57.292
Bitter and jaded, see "Rachel."

23:57.292 --> 24:04.292
Impatient, grumpy, and
short, see "Eddie."

24:04.292 --> 24:07.792
Oh, don't talk to me, nobody,
till I have my coffee!

24:07.792 --> 24:09.459
I got the plate right
behind you.

24:09.459 --> 24:10.542
Come on, buddy,
come sit next to me.

24:10.542 --> 24:12.125
She does everything so cute.

24:12.125 --> 24:15.250
Fresh, warm, whole blueberries.

24:15.250 --> 24:17.501
We've got a lobster Benedict
with hollandaise.

24:17.501 --> 24:19.584
-Wow.
-And French toast.

24:19.584 --> 24:21.083
You want lobster
for breakfast?

24:21.083 --> 24:23.584
Scrambled egg whites, that's it.

24:23.584 --> 24:25.792
I mean, I heard her French toast
is out of this world.

24:25.792 --> 24:28.250
I think I'm gonna have to
go with that lobster thing.

24:28.250 --> 24:39.417
I think that's a great idea.

24:39.417 --> 24:41.250
I'm sore.

24:41.250 --> 24:43.334
I need to, like, be in bed for
two days and get a massage.

24:43.334 --> 24:46.292
Oh, yeah, that's right.

24:46.292 --> 24:47.626
What's the longest massage
you can have?

24:47.626 --> 24:49.459
-For me?
-Yeah.

24:49.459 --> 24:52.375
-I can do an hour and a half.
-I'll give you a massage.

24:52.375 --> 24:53.876
I will...

24:53.876 --> 24:54.918
Oh, just show Jodi a little
bit of your technique.

24:54.918 --> 24:58.918
Just a little bit.

24:58.918 --> 25:01.667
-Oh, wow.
-Oh, yeah.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.667
We'll be hauling anchor
pretty soon.

25:03.667 --> 25:04.792
Everything should be secured.

25:04.792 --> 25:07.250
-Yeah.
-Understand?

25:07.250 --> 25:08.584
I'm gonna go and check
the bridge deck aft.

25:08.584 --> 25:10.626
Coming into this docking
does make me, obviously,

25:10.626 --> 25:12.542
a little nervous, going through
the same channel

25:12.542 --> 25:14.501
that last time was
a complete failure.

25:14.501 --> 25:16.501
Go ahead and drop fenders.

25:16.501 --> 25:18.083
Oh, man, we lost the cover.

25:18.083 --> 25:19.209
Fender cover's lost.

25:19.209 --> 25:20.751
Jesus Christ.

25:20.751 --> 25:23.209
As first officer, I wanna
spend as much time on the bridge

25:23.209 --> 25:24.751
as possible, so I am
looking for Jake

25:24.751 --> 25:27.209
to take the responsibility
of the deck.

25:27.209 --> 25:29.417
Too old for this sh--.

25:29.417 --> 25:32.334
Doctor says I need a backiotomy.

25:32.334 --> 25:33.292
Wes and Rayna, will you guys
make sure

25:33.292 --> 25:35.209
those fenders get up...

25:35.209 --> 25:36.751
don't freaking salute me,
there's snipers in those hills.

25:36.751 --> 25:39.292
They love pickin' off officers.

25:39.292 --> 25:42.584
You have three French toast
orders and one lobster Benedict.

25:42.584 --> 25:47.209
And one order of
scrambled egg whites.

25:47.209 --> 25:48.542
Scrambled egg whites...

25:48.542 --> 25:50.501
that is the bane
of my existence.

25:50.501 --> 25:53.250
When you go to, like,
make them, they just weep.

25:53.250 --> 25:57.375
Just this, like, soppy,
wet, liquidy, nasty funk.

25:57.375 --> 25:59.417
----ing scrambled egg whites.

25:59.417 --> 26:00.876
And then I'm almost done
with the French toast.

26:00.876 --> 26:03.417
Okay, I'll be back.
Thank you, Chef.

26:03.417 --> 26:04.542
Wait, where are you going?

26:04.542 --> 26:05.709
You have to be this way.

26:05.709 --> 26:06.834
Oh, we're...
over that side?

26:06.834 --> 26:08.834
I have to finish blowing it.

26:08.834 --> 26:10.417
Oh!

26:10.417 --> 26:12.167
-Egg whites for you, sir.
-Look at that.

26:12.167 --> 26:13.918
Thank you, thank you.

26:13.918 --> 26:15.667
Coming in with the French toast.

26:15.667 --> 26:17.709
Wow, that looks so good.

26:17.709 --> 26:19.209
How does she just do this?

26:19.209 --> 26:20.709
-Bacon, Samuel?
-French toast for you, sir.

26:20.709 --> 26:23.375
Wow.

26:23.375 --> 26:25.334
Oh, God.

26:25.334 --> 26:28.334
I don't know that I've ever
tasted anything like this.

26:28.334 --> 26:29.918
Oh, my gosh.

26:29.918 --> 26:31.834
I mean, are you kidding me?

26:31.834 --> 26:34.083
-Good?
-Mm!

26:34.083 --> 26:35.375
All right, let's pull the hook.

26:35.375 --> 26:42.459
Copy that.
Anchor off the bottom.

26:42.459 --> 26:43.834
-Rachel!
-Hello, sir.

26:43.834 --> 26:45.709
Oh, my goodness,
best three days of food

26:45.709 --> 26:50.334
I think we've all ever had.

26:50.334 --> 26:51.501
Thank you.

26:51.501 --> 26:52.584
Copy that.

26:52.584 --> 27:02.751
It's just magic.

27:02.751 --> 27:06.918
You're really tripping.

27:06.918 --> 27:18.209
Did we strip all the beds,
or just the ones down...

27:18.209 --> 27:24.667
Mm!

27:24.667 --> 27:27.209
On a scale from one to
10, Jess is at, like,

27:27.209 --> 27:30.584
8.2 clueless vibe.

27:30.584 --> 27:32.751
They say work smarter,
not harder,

27:32.751 --> 27:38.292
but it seems as though
Jess is doing neither.

27:38.292 --> 27:40.501
Deck team, deck team, go ahead
and ready fenders for docking.

27:40.501 --> 27:41.667
Prepare fenders.

27:41.667 --> 27:44.876
So, like, throw them over now?

27:44.876 --> 27:47.792
Wind, 18 knots...
that's very doable.

27:47.792 --> 27:48.918
It's gonna go perfect, right?

27:48.918 --> 27:51.250
-Perfect.
-Perfect.

27:51.250 --> 27:52.292
I've had enough of
getting yelled at

27:52.292 --> 27:54.209
for deck team's mistakes.

27:54.209 --> 27:56.584
I'm tired.
I'm exhausted.

27:56.584 --> 27:58.584
I'm gonna have me and
Rayna forward.

27:58.584 --> 27:59.709
-Wes here.
-Okay.

27:59.709 --> 28:01.375
Moving to the wing station.

28:01.375 --> 28:03.250
Starboard quarter,
we're about 100 feet off.

28:03.250 --> 28:04.459
Let's come up a little bit...
right there.

28:04.459 --> 28:05.792
Right there.
Got it.

28:05.792 --> 28:07.709
You've got 35 feet
on the port side.

28:07.709 --> 28:08.834
Line's going across.

28:08.834 --> 28:10.375
First line's across.

28:10.375 --> 28:12.250
Mm...
how's that look?

28:12.250 --> 28:13.584
Stern lines locked in,
stern lines locked in.

28:13.584 --> 28:15.125
Copy that.

28:15.125 --> 28:17.375
Well done, everybody,
thank you.

28:17.375 --> 28:19.417
Easy, didn't even
break a sweat.

28:19.417 --> 28:21.250
Pretty work, I like it.

28:21.250 --> 28:22.834
Yeah, good job.

28:22.834 --> 28:23.834
Hi, honey, I'm home.

28:23.834 --> 28:27.083
Welcome home, sweetie.

28:27.083 --> 28:28.125
Coming up...

28:28.125 --> 28:29.792
Jake, Jake!

28:29.792 --> 28:31.542
He's my boss,
the naked one is my boss.

28:31.542 --> 28:33.125
Are you gonna crawl?

28:33.125 --> 28:36.876
Get on all fours and,
like, cat-crawl to it.

28:36.876 --> 28:42.667
Oh, my God.

28:42.667 --> 28:45.667
Attention, all crew, I need
everybody in their whites ASAP.

28:45.667 --> 28:48.334
No makeup, not okay.

28:48.334 --> 28:49.751
I'm the worst packer ever.

28:49.751 --> 28:52.959
I need everybody
on the aft deck now.

28:52.959 --> 28:54.292
Deck team copies, on our way.

28:54.292 --> 28:56.459
Copy for interior.

28:56.459 --> 28:58.209
I don't wanna say goodbye!

28:58.209 --> 28:59.459
Oh!

28:59.459 --> 29:01.292
Gimme a big hug.

29:01.292 --> 29:04.209
My pleasure, thank you.

29:04.209 --> 29:05.292
Thank you so much.

29:05.292 --> 29:06.667
How you doing, sailor?

29:06.667 --> 29:08.459
We had a great time,
you guys are awesome.

29:08.459 --> 29:11.792
Food was spectacular.
We'll miss you.

29:11.792 --> 29:14.584
Here.

29:14.584 --> 29:16.751
The kid has a case
handcuffed to his wrist.

29:16.751 --> 29:17.959
Oh, God.

29:17.959 --> 29:18.959
Thank you.

29:18.959 --> 29:20.334
-Oh!
-Thank you!

29:20.334 --> 29:21.751
-Thank you so much.
-Thanks, buddy.

29:21.751 --> 29:23.167
-Yeah.
-We're gonna miss you!

29:23.167 --> 29:24.501
Yes.

29:24.501 --> 29:25.918
Okay, you know the drill.

29:25.918 --> 29:27.334
Let's get this trash outta here.

29:27.334 --> 29:29.167
Yes!

29:29.167 --> 29:35.876
I need this sh-- to be over
with, because I need a beer.

29:35.876 --> 29:38.542
This is my uniform.
This is compulsory.

29:38.542 --> 29:40.626
Eddie gave me two.

29:40.626 --> 29:43.751
I'm actually at a loss
for words right now.

29:43.751 --> 29:47.250
Attention all crew, I need to
have everybody in the crew mess.

29:47.250 --> 29:51.501
All right, let's go.

29:51.501 --> 29:54.375
Money dance, money dance.

29:54.375 --> 29:58.751
Okay, Mr. Wide-leg, get those
things closer, scoot in!

29:58.751 --> 30:03.501
-Who's on the radio?
-I am.

30:03.501 --> 30:04.501
[laughing]

30:04.501 --> 30:05.667
Great charter.

30:05.667 --> 30:07.876
I think it went very, very well.

30:07.876 --> 30:10.125
It was nice to see
you come outta your shell

30:10.125 --> 30:11.667
a little bit with your
wig and everything.

30:11.667 --> 30:13.834
Oh, my God.

30:13.834 --> 30:15.667
Once I get
my colorful hair back,

30:15.667 --> 30:17.542
you know, the me comes alive.

30:17.542 --> 30:21.375
Is that it?

30:21.375 --> 30:22.542
Go, Jess.

30:22.542 --> 30:24.709
The docking today...
flawless.

30:24.709 --> 30:26.417
Almost like we knew
what we were doing.

30:26.417 --> 30:28.083
-Almost.
-Perfect.

30:28.083 --> 30:33.209
Okay, we'll get to the
important part here.

30:33.209 --> 30:35.542
-Ooh.
-Oh!

30:35.542 --> 30:37.125
-Wow!
-That's a lotta money!

30:37.125 --> 30:38.417
Twenty-five large.

30:38.417 --> 30:43.709
-Whoa!
-Yeah!

30:43.709 --> 30:46.375
Big tip.
Big... big, big tip.

30:46.375 --> 30:48.167
Well done, team.

30:48.167 --> 30:49.834
Have a good time tonight,
you guys definitely earned it.

30:49.834 --> 30:52.417
Go out, have some fun, and we'll
get after it again tomorrow.

30:52.417 --> 30:53.751
-Bye, Captain.
-Thanks, Captain Lee!

30:53.751 --> 30:55.167
-See you later, guys.
-You're welcome.

30:55.167 --> 30:56.834
I like to roll around
in it sometimes.

30:56.834 --> 31:00.626
Make it rain!

31:00.626 --> 31:02.375
Oh, it's thick, like it?

31:02.375 --> 31:06.584
Ooh!

31:06.584 --> 31:09.459
Nice tip, eh?

31:09.459 --> 31:12.250
Pick it up like you got
some bills to pay!

31:12.250 --> 31:13.709
I love money!

31:13.709 --> 31:15.417
I'm in a good mood now.

31:15.417 --> 31:25.125
Yeah, that was a good POB...
nice pat on the back.

31:25.125 --> 31:28.125
Is that what we've
gotta do, nothing?

31:28.125 --> 31:29.542
Do nothing, don't smile,

31:29.542 --> 31:32.375
and then get a mention,
get a gold star.

31:32.375 --> 31:36.250
Yeah, whoever said you need
to screw your way to the top?

31:36.250 --> 31:38.209
Just do ----ing nothing.

31:38.209 --> 31:40.292
So, Wes, you gonna sit
with Jess tonight, eh?

31:40.292 --> 31:41.626
Yeah, probably.

31:41.626 --> 31:43.584
The way I see every
single crew member,

31:43.584 --> 31:45.792
that's probably the only seat
that's gonna be available.

31:45.792 --> 31:47.584
It's a bit like junior high.

31:47.584 --> 31:49.459
Oh, what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna make the moves?

31:49.459 --> 31:51.209
Would I have done
that on my own time

31:51.209 --> 31:52.417
before you guys poked
and prodded about it?

31:52.417 --> 31:53.501
Yeah, I would have.

31:53.501 --> 31:55.209
Now it's ----ing weird, man.

31:55.209 --> 31:57.417
Hey, guys, wrap it up,
we're knocking off.

31:57.417 --> 31:58.876
-Did you hear the news?
-Wrap it up, we're knocking off.

31:58.876 --> 32:00.250
-Wrap it up, we're knocking off.
-What?

32:00.250 --> 32:04.584
Shower, beer.

32:04.584 --> 32:05.876
Here we are.

32:05.876 --> 32:07.209
Oh, perfect.

32:07.209 --> 32:10.709
I wanna be part of
the linen gang.

32:10.709 --> 32:12.250
Big boy arms, eh?

32:12.250 --> 32:13.459
Oh [bleep] off.

32:13.459 --> 32:15.459
You know who you remind
me of right now?

32:15.459 --> 32:16.584
Lois Lane.

32:16.584 --> 32:18.250
Where's my Superman?

32:18.250 --> 32:19.751
Ooh, snacks.

32:19.751 --> 32:23.626
To the car, to the car,
darling.

32:23.626 --> 32:29.250
You look gorg.

32:29.250 --> 32:30.417
-Woo!
-That was epic.

32:30.417 --> 32:35.542
Hell, yeah.

32:35.542 --> 32:39.918
Wow, look at this.

32:39.918 --> 32:41.417
No way!

32:41.417 --> 32:43.501
I love this!

32:43.501 --> 32:46.375
Let's get to business.

32:46.375 --> 32:49.375
Can I please do
the pumpkin chana?

32:49.375 --> 32:52.292
I'm gonna have this bad girl,
the petit filet mignon.

32:52.292 --> 32:53.626
Six-ounce filet?

32:53.626 --> 32:55.334
I will just start
with a Caesar.

32:55.334 --> 32:57.292
If my eyebrows
and my lashes went up,

32:57.292 --> 32:58.459
I would fly out tonight.

32:58.459 --> 33:00.334
All right, cheers to everyone.

33:00.334 --> 33:02.501
Great crew and awesome [bleep].

33:02.501 --> 33:03.584
Great crew, everybody.

33:03.584 --> 33:05.918
[chattering]

33:05.918 --> 33:23.584
Cheers, everybody, cheers.

33:23.584 --> 33:27.334
How are you?

33:27.334 --> 33:30.542
Hello.

33:30.542 --> 33:31.542
This is my third.

33:31.542 --> 33:33.417
-Your third?
-Third.

33:33.417 --> 33:35.250
Jake's coming
on a little strong,

33:35.250 --> 33:37.209
and if I didn't
have a boyfriend,

33:37.209 --> 33:38.209
he would stand a chance.

33:38.209 --> 33:39.792
But at the same time,

33:39.792 --> 33:41.792
the 'stache looks prettier
and prettier every day.

33:41.792 --> 33:50.834
Fluff your hair.
It's laying too flat.

33:50.834 --> 33:53.584
Oh, man, I'm done
with the table now.

33:53.584 --> 33:55.250
Oh, do you know what I mean?

33:55.250 --> 33:57.417
I know you're used to
that posh type of sh--.

33:57.417 --> 33:58.918
Oh, shut up, Jake.

33:58.918 --> 34:01.626
Actually, I'm gonna
take one, too.

34:01.626 --> 34:02.918
Are they all in the bathroom?

34:02.918 --> 34:06.959
No, they're smokin' a stogie.

34:06.959 --> 34:09.626
Ooh!

34:09.626 --> 34:10.834
I'm sorry, did you like
that coconut?

34:10.834 --> 34:12.209
Ooh!

34:12.209 --> 34:13.709
Jess does give me butterflies.

34:13.709 --> 34:18.250
She reminds me of somebody
that I had a big crush on.

34:18.250 --> 34:19.918
Thought it was going someplace.

34:19.918 --> 34:21.459
She totally broke my heart.

34:21.459 --> 34:25.459
So, I stopped taking chances,
played it safe.

34:25.459 --> 34:27.792
I do this for a little while,
I take off, I don't work.

34:27.792 --> 34:29.375
If you could do it
like the old people,

34:29.375 --> 34:31.250
retire and do their
own things, would you?

34:31.250 --> 34:33.626
Got two 85-year-olds at home.

34:33.626 --> 34:37.292
I live that retired life.

34:37.292 --> 34:41.459
Excuse me, sir, can we
order some shots, please?

34:41.459 --> 34:45.209
[overlapping dialogue]

34:45.209 --> 34:47.918
Jake is very attractive, and
I might have a little crush.

34:47.918 --> 34:51.292
Honestly, these abs.

34:51.292 --> 34:54.876
He is a full-blown man whore,
but that doesn't affect me.

34:54.876 --> 34:58.209
He's straight and I'm gay.

34:58.209 --> 34:59.667
I'm not...
I'm not stupid.

34:59.667 --> 35:01.417
Oh!

35:01.417 --> 35:02.751
What the [bleep]
happened to your pants?

35:02.751 --> 35:04.667
-Put your Goddamn pants on!
-Oh, my God!

35:04.667 --> 35:05.834
Just don't put the front down.

35:05.834 --> 35:07.834
No, put the front down,
[bleep] it.

35:07.834 --> 35:16.334
Don't listen to her, you don't
wanna embarrass yourself.

35:16.334 --> 35:17.834
Hey, come here!

35:17.834 --> 35:20.709
I wanna see what it
looks like, at least.

35:20.709 --> 35:22.584
He's my boss,
the naked one is my boss.

35:22.584 --> 35:25.584
[laughing]

35:25.584 --> 35:29.626
Coming up...

35:29.626 --> 35:33.292
-Hey, bitches...
-Yeah!

35:33.292 --> 35:36.542
Oh, my God, am I gonna
see some ----ing?

35:36.542 --> 35:37.584
This is great!

35:37.584 --> 35:37.584
Yes!

35:37.584 --> 35:43.584
Attention, all crew, I need
everybody in their whites ASAP.

35:43.584 --> 35:47.167
There's a naked one.

35:47.167 --> 35:48.792
I can't.

35:48.792 --> 35:50.292
-This guy.
-Don't do that, you Sherlock!

35:50.292 --> 35:51.292
-Why do that?
-Oh, my God.

35:51.292 --> 35:53.292
Where is he going?

35:53.292 --> 35:56.417
I can't see your penis from
here, your legs are too white.

35:56.417 --> 35:58.584
Why don't you just give
the hands to the sky?

35:58.584 --> 36:04.459
Don't do this!

36:04.459 --> 36:06.626
He's my boss,
the naked one is my boss.

36:06.626 --> 36:08.542
This is, like,
my impression of Jake.

36:08.542 --> 36:11.334
Yeah, woohoo!

36:11.334 --> 36:15.667
Oh, they're idiots.

36:15.667 --> 36:19.501
Winkie to winkie?

36:19.501 --> 36:20.959
All right.

36:20.959 --> 36:23.501
-Oh, you want a towel?
-Sure.

36:23.501 --> 36:25.000
Oh, no, you gotta
walk to yours.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.501
Are you gonna crawl?

36:26.501 --> 36:28.667
Does that not hurt?
You gotta work for it.

36:28.667 --> 36:31.834
Oh, what a... oh, Jake's ----ing
[bleep] is floppin'.

36:31.834 --> 36:32.918
What?

36:32.918 --> 36:34.459
Oh, my God.

36:34.459 --> 36:37.167
All right, come on,
let's do this.

36:37.167 --> 36:38.501
What are we doing
after this, you guys?

36:38.501 --> 36:40.167
Going back to the yacht.

36:40.167 --> 36:41.250
Guys, we're moving.

36:41.250 --> 36:42.250
Let's get outta here.

36:42.250 --> 36:43.459
Thank you, guys.

36:43.459 --> 36:44.751
How's your night going?

36:44.751 --> 36:46.125
It's going good.

36:46.125 --> 36:47.584
All right, I wanna be
with Rayna.

36:47.584 --> 36:55.501
-Here.
-Get in, get in with him.

36:55.501 --> 36:57.209
Be ready for it.

36:57.209 --> 37:00.584
So, everybody got retina burn
from Jake's ass, right?

37:00.584 --> 37:02.292
I still can't over the fact
that I saw his

37:02.292 --> 37:06.542
flaccid penis flopping about.

37:06.542 --> 37:07.542
All right, truth or dare.

37:07.542 --> 37:08.918
Oh, God, here we go again.

37:08.918 --> 37:11.626
Dare you guys to kiss,
because I wanna see it.

37:11.626 --> 37:14.250
Tongue kiss.

37:14.250 --> 37:16.584
Yeah!

37:16.584 --> 37:18.834
Yes.

37:18.834 --> 37:20.626
I just can't wait until
my hands don't feel like...

37:20.626 --> 37:22.292
So tired.

37:22.292 --> 37:33.417
I'm, like, getting,
like, early arthritis.

37:33.417 --> 37:37.542
That's a great thing.

37:37.542 --> 37:39.250
Hey, bitches...

37:39.250 --> 37:41.792
Oh, my God, am I gonna
see some ----ing?

37:41.792 --> 37:43.375
This is great!

37:43.375 --> 37:45.209
Maybe I should start
watching gay men porn.

37:45.209 --> 37:48.792
I did not say that out loud,
Mom and Dad.

37:48.792 --> 37:55.334
That was some bitch behind me.

37:55.334 --> 37:57.292
Five for the dismount, five.

37:57.292 --> 37:58.459
This is amazing.

37:58.459 --> 38:02.459
Did you see the full moon?

38:02.459 --> 38:04.000
-No!
-Yes!

38:04.000 --> 38:08.584
I don't think anything
fazes Jake at this point.

38:08.584 --> 38:10.209
Jake's gonna be
the village bicycle.

38:10.209 --> 38:11.334
I think everybody's
gonna get a ride

38:11.334 --> 38:15.292
with his handlebar moustache.

38:15.292 --> 38:16.417
Quickly!

38:16.417 --> 38:23.709
Oh [bleep] off... go!

38:23.709 --> 38:32.334
Wesley !

38:32.334 --> 38:33.334
You're going
to smoke a cigar?

38:33.334 --> 38:35.334
-Whoa!
-Sh--.

38:35.334 --> 38:39.709
Oh, [bleep]!

38:39.709 --> 38:41.209
That's all right.

38:41.209 --> 38:42.334
-I'm good.
-That's your hair.

38:42.334 --> 38:43.334
We're good.

38:43.334 --> 38:44.626
Something's burning.

38:44.626 --> 38:46.751
Hey, where do you
wanna smoke a cigar?

38:46.751 --> 38:49.501
There's burnt hair.

38:49.501 --> 38:53.250
You smell that, right?

38:53.250 --> 38:55.292
Why do I smell, like, hair?

38:55.292 --> 38:56.334
Burning hair?

38:56.334 --> 38:58.000
-Yeah.
-That's me.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.250
Burning hair.

38:59.250 --> 39:02.375
Okay. That's one way.

39:02.375 --> 39:05.876
Ooh, don't go underwater.

39:05.876 --> 39:07.375
Rayna, are you
just sitting here...

39:07.375 --> 39:08.375
-Rayna.
-like, eating...

39:08.375 --> 39:10.334
Shut up.

39:10.334 --> 39:13.501
No, I'm good, girl.

39:13.501 --> 39:18.584
Oh...

39:18.584 --> 39:21.459
What?

39:21.459 --> 39:22.584
It just depresses me.

39:22.584 --> 39:23.584
Yeah.

39:23.584 --> 39:24.584
-Tattoo.
-None.

39:24.584 --> 39:25.751
-None?
-None.

39:25.751 --> 39:27.292
-Seriously?
-Yeah, no tattoos.

39:27.292 --> 39:28.626
What's gonna happen
with Wes and Jess?

39:28.626 --> 39:30.292
I was just gonna say,
I'm really glad

39:30.292 --> 39:31.292
she kinda came out of
her shell tonight.

39:31.292 --> 39:32.751
Really pushing it.

39:32.751 --> 39:34.167
-She did, a little bit.
-Trying to keep the team intact.

39:34.167 --> 39:35.792
Because, like, she's so...

39:35.792 --> 39:37.334
But Captain Lee's comment
today at the table...

39:37.334 --> 39:38.834
-Loves her.
-It's taking down Fraser.

39:38.834 --> 39:40.584
He hasn't gotten one word
of praise from the man,

39:40.584 --> 39:42.542
and he said, "I'm just
gonna start kicking around

39:42.542 --> 39:44.542
"with a piss-poor attitude
and do nothing,

39:44.542 --> 39:46.584
and hopefully I'll finally get
the praise I'm looking for."

39:46.584 --> 39:52.334
I'm like, well,
that's not what I need.

39:52.334 --> 39:53.584
Are you out?

39:53.584 --> 39:55.959
-Hey, hey, hey!
-Ciao.

39:55.959 --> 39:56.959
Night!

39:56.959 --> 39:58.459
-Hello.
-Hi.

39:58.459 --> 39:59.626
-Good night, y'all.
-Night, Eddie.

39:59.626 --> 40:05.918
We love you.

40:05.918 --> 40:07.751
I know!

40:07.751 --> 40:17.292
Oh!

40:17.292 --> 40:20.584
----ed.

40:20.584 --> 40:25.751
[snoring]

40:25.751 --> 40:28.417
Ah, I don't wanna get up!

40:28.417 --> 40:34.751
Oh, good grief.

40:34.751 --> 40:35.751
How you feel?

40:35.751 --> 40:37.792
Tired and hung over.

40:37.792 --> 40:38.792
We can make some.

40:38.792 --> 40:40.459
Look how fresh Jess looks.

40:40.459 --> 40:42.584
So fresh.

40:42.584 --> 40:46.459
Okay.

40:46.459 --> 40:48.125
I feel like you
haven't hit hangover yet,

40:48.125 --> 40:52.417
you're still drunk.

40:52.417 --> 40:54.959
How do you guys feel?

40:54.959 --> 40:58.918
You guys remember the pool bar?

40:58.918 --> 41:00.542
No!

41:00.542 --> 41:02.876
I gotta go.
I ain't about to be late.

41:02.876 --> 41:05.626
I'm gonna at least
act like I'm working.

41:05.626 --> 41:06.834
-Morning, Eddie.
-Good morning.

41:06.834 --> 41:07.834
Good morning, Ed.

41:07.834 --> 41:11.626
Ah, you mother----er.

41:11.626 --> 41:13.792
Oh, boy, that hurt.

41:13.792 --> 41:15.626
How you doing?

41:15.626 --> 41:18.584
Jesus Christ, why did
I get so drunk?

41:18.584 --> 41:19.959
Your zipper's down.

41:19.959 --> 41:22.834
Do you remember
making out with Fraser?

41:22.834 --> 41:24.375
No, I don't, actually.

41:24.375 --> 41:25.501
No? You did do that.

41:25.501 --> 41:26.792
-Did I?
-Yeah.

41:26.792 --> 41:27.834
Mother----er.

41:27.834 --> 41:29.292
-Hello.
-You smell nice.

41:29.292 --> 41:30.876
Mm, thank you, so do you.

41:30.876 --> 41:32.584
I smell like alcohol
and cigarettes.

41:32.584 --> 41:36.667
I love the pictures of
you two I got last night.

41:36.667 --> 41:42.918
Yes!

41:42.918 --> 41:44.584
What?

41:44.584 --> 41:45.751
Did you not know that?

41:45.751 --> 41:46.751
No!

41:46.751 --> 41:47.918
Like, multiple times.

41:47.918 --> 41:50.209
I am mortified.

41:50.209 --> 41:51.876
Oh [bleep]!

41:51.876 --> 41:53.876
Jake is straight,
and now he possibly thinks

41:53.876 --> 41:56.667
that I'm into him,
which is awful,

41:56.667 --> 41:58.709
and potentially very
uncomfortable for him.

41:58.709 --> 42:01.834
[bleep] me, I've put
my best friend relationship

42:01.834 --> 42:03.375
on the boat at risk.

42:03.375 --> 42:13.250
On the inside, I'm crumbling.

42:13.250 --> 42:14.584
[bleep]

42:14.584 --> 42:15.918
Next, on "Below Deck"...

42:15.918 --> 42:17.459
Gonna put a little
pressure on Jess.

42:17.459 --> 42:18.751
Okay.

42:18.751 --> 42:19.918
And I'd love to
put her on service

42:19.918 --> 42:22.250
-and you on laundry.
-Okay.

42:22.250 --> 42:23.459
Where's she at?

42:23.459 --> 42:24.626
What can I help you
with today, sir?

42:24.626 --> 42:26.417
-Uh-oh.
-Am I allowed to do this?

42:26.417 --> 42:27.792
It's your vacation.

42:27.792 --> 42:29.792
This is embarrassing.

42:29.792 --> 42:32.667
All eyes on you right now,
and training day is over with.

42:32.667 --> 42:33.959
-Hello!
-How are you?

42:33.959 --> 42:35.542
-Michael.
-Michael, my pleasure.

42:35.542 --> 42:36.876
The primary's recovering
from breast cancer.

42:36.876 --> 42:38.417
Right.

42:38.417 --> 42:40.167
So, I guess they're
celebrating boobs.

42:40.167 --> 42:41.209
I was gonna do, like,
a vanilla cake with coconut,

42:41.209 --> 42:42.709
with, like, cherry nipples.

42:42.709 --> 42:44.334
Cherry boobs?

42:44.334 --> 42:46.334
These conversations go south
so ----ing quick.

42:46.334 --> 42:48.501
Hey, Wes, you need
to attach it to your stern

42:48.501 --> 42:51.584
so you get more ----ing pull.

42:51.584 --> 42:52.626
What are you doing, Wes?

42:52.626 --> 42:53.959
-Wes!
-Hey, Wes, Wes...

42:53.959 --> 42:55.459
Is the whole thing
in the water again?

42:55.459 --> 42:56.834
Shut up for a second!

42:56.834 --> 42:58.459
No sh--.

42:58.459 --> 42:59.459
I'm gonna rip someone's
---ing head off.

42:59.459 --> 43:03.417
That's my job.
