WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:04.635
DANIELLE CAME BACK HOME.

00:04.635 --> 00:07.478
LYNETTE WAS AFRAID
FOR HER CHILDREN...

00:07.478 --> 00:10.181
IT FEELS LIKE
I'VE RUINED THEIR CHILDHOOD.

00:10.181 --> 00:12.483
KATHERINE'S PAST...
 WE KNOW ALL ABOUT CHICAGO.

00:12.483 --> 00:16.117
CAME BACK TO HAUNT HER.
 OH, GOOD. WE'RE IN AGREEMENT.
THE FOUNTAIN STAYS.

00:16.117 --> 00:18.089
EDIE MADE THREATS...

00:18.089 --> 00:21.092
IF THE I.R.S. GETS WIND
OF YOUR RAINY DAY FUND,

00:21.092 --> 00:23.394
THEY COULD MAKE ME TESTIFY
AGAINST YOU.

00:23.394 --> 00:27.298
BUT EVASIVE ACTION WAS TAKEN.

00:27.298 --> 00:29.300
I WANT US TO BE TOGETHER,
TOO,

00:29.300 --> 00:32.162
BUT I ALSO WANNA FEEL GOOD
ABOUT IT.

00:32.162 --> 00:34.805
AND GABY AND CARLOS
ENDED THEIR AFFAIR...

00:34.805 --> 00:37.508
(camera shutter snaps)

00:37.508 --> 00:39.410
TOO LATE.

00:39.410 --> 00:42.213
COULD YOU MAKE IT OUT
TO "CASH"?

00:42.213 --> 00:43.214
(chuckles)

00:47.148 --> 00:49.150
(Mary Alice)
AS A LITTLE GIRL,

00:49.150 --> 00:52.183
EDIE BRITT
WAS AFRAID OF MANY THINGS,

00:52.183 --> 00:56.827
AND ALL THE LITTLE BOYS
IN HER NEIGHBORHOOD KNEW THIS.

00:56.827 --> 01:00.391
SO THEY WOULD WAIT FOR HER
WITH RUBBER SNAKES

01:00.391 --> 01:02.463
AND CROAKING FROGS...
 (ribbit)

01:02.463 --> 01:05.096
AND PLASTIC SPIDERS,

01:05.096 --> 01:08.139
HOPING TO MAKE EDIE SCREAM.

01:08.139 --> 01:10.070
(all) AAH!
 (screaming)

01:10.070 --> 01:12.243
(boys laugh)

01:12.243 --> 01:14.675
BUT ONCE SHE WAS A BIG GIRL,

01:14.675 --> 01:18.679
EDIE BRITT WAS AFRAID
OF ONLY ONE THING--

01:18.679 --> 01:21.112
THAT HER LOVER MIGHT LEAVE HER

01:21.112 --> 01:24.215
FOR SOMEONE ELSE,

01:24.215 --> 01:26.487
AND CARLOS SOLIS KNEW THIS.

01:26.487 --> 01:30.591
SO WHEN HE DECIDED TO GO,
HE TRIED TO DO IT QUICKLY...

01:30.591 --> 01:33.194
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

01:33.194 --> 01:35.666
MOSTLY TO AVOID HER SCREAMING.

01:35.666 --> 01:38.669
IT JUST HASN'T BEEN WORKING
FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.

01:38.669 --> 01:40.831
(sighs) THAT'S A LIE.
WE WERE HAPPY.

01:40.831 --> 01:42.833
COME ON. LET'S NOT ARGUE.

01:42.833 --> 01:44.835
I WANT US TO END THIS
AS FRIENDS.

01:44.835 --> 01:48.179
I BET YOU DO, GIVEN ALL I KNOW
ABOUT YOUR FINANCES.

01:48.179 --> 01:52.843
THAT'S TRUE.
YOU KNOW SOME OF MY SECRETS,

01:52.843 --> 01:57.117
BUT I'M BETTING YOU STILL CARE
ENOUGH ABOUT ME TO KEEP THEM.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.790
ALL RIGHT.

01:59.790 --> 02:01.792
I WON'T SAY ANYTHING
TO ANYONE

02:01.792 --> 02:04.225
ABOUT YOUR MONEY
IN THE GRAND CAYMANS

02:04.225 --> 02:05.526
ON ONE CONDITION--

02:05.526 --> 02:09.530
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME THE TRUTH
ABOUT WHY YOU'RE LEAVING.

02:11.402 --> 02:13.164
THE TRUTH?

02:13.164 --> 02:15.166
IS THERE SOMEONE ELSE?

02:16.737 --> 02:18.269
NO.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.174
THANK YOU, CARLOS.

02:23.174 --> 02:25.476
YOU MADE THIS
A LOT EASIER.

02:29.820 --> 02:35.186
YES, EDIE BRITT HAD BEEN FORCED
TO FACE HER WORST FEAR,

02:35.186 --> 02:38.189
AND SHE NOW FELT
IT WAS ONLY FAIR...

02:38.189 --> 02:39.530
HI.

02:39.530 --> 02:42.233
UM, I KNOW A GUY
WHO'S GOT MILLIONS

02:42.233 --> 02:44.835
IN A OFFSHORE BANK ACCOUNT.

02:44.835 --> 02:47.898
WHO WOULD I
TALK TO ABOUT THAT?

02:47.898 --> 03:02.283
THAT CARLOS SHOULD FACE HIS.

03:02.283 --> 03:03.584
(woman shouts indistinctly)

03:03.584 --> 03:07.258
YES, IT WAS THAT TIME OF YEAR.

03:07.258 --> 03:11.362
HALLOWEEN HAD COME ONCE AGAIN
TO WISTERIA LANE,

03:11.362 --> 03:15.696
AND NO ONE WAS MORE DETERMINED
TO CELEBRATE ITS ARRIVAL

03:15.696 --> 03:19.199
THAN THE GAY COUPLE
WHO HAD JUST MOVED IN.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.372
SO WHICH OF THE NEIGHBORS
SHOULD WE INVITE FIRST?

03:21.372 --> 03:24.375
WHAT DOES IT MATTER?
THEY ALL HATE US?
 OH, LEE, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
THEY HATE YOU.

03:24.375 --> 03:26.677
I'M THE BUTCH ONE THEY CAN
FEEL COMFORTABLE AROUND.

03:26.677 --> 03:30.210
YOU KEEP
TELLING YOURSELF THAT.
 LET'S START WITH BREE.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.443
SHE'S GOT A GAY SON.
I BET SHE'S HOMO-FRIENDLY.

03:32.443 --> 03:34.945
WHY? MY MOTHER HAS ONE,
AND SHE'S NOT.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.519
HI.

03:38.519 --> 03:40.391
OH, HELLO.

03:40.391 --> 03:42.393
WE'RE JUST DROPPING BY
TO LET YOU KNOW

03:42.393 --> 03:45.225
WE'RE HAVING A HALLOWEEN PARTY.
WE'D LOVE FOR YOU TO COME.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.798
OH, WELL, THANK YOU.
ORSON AND I WOULD BE DELIGHTED.

03:47.798 --> 03:50.461
WELL, YOU CAN BRING
YOUR WHOLE FAMILY IF YOU LIKE.

03:50.461 --> 03:52.363
IS THAT YOUR DAUGHTER?

03:53.604 --> 03:55.606
UH, NO, MY DAUGHTER
IS IN SWITZERLAND,

03:55.606 --> 03:57.237
AT BOARDING SCHOOL.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.310
WHO WAS THAT?

03:59.310 --> 04:01.372
MY SON...

04:01.372 --> 04:03.514
TRYING ON HIS COSTUME.

04:03.514 --> 04:05.946
HE'S GOING TO BE CHER
THIS YEAR.

04:05.946 --> 04:08.279
OKAY,
HE'S DEFINITELY INVITED.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.956
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU
TO STAY AWAY FROM THE WINDOWS?

04:15.956 --> 04:18.459
I'M BORED.
YOU WON'T LET ME GO OUTSIDE.

04:18.459 --> 04:21.362
CAN'T I AT LEAST LOOK?
 WHAT'S THAT?

04:21.362 --> 04:23.864
OH, WE'VE BEEN INVITED
TO BOB AND LEE'S FOR HALLOWEEN.

04:23.864 --> 04:26.697
A COSTUME PARTY. COOL.
CAN I GO?

04:26.697 --> 04:28.669
ARE YOU INSANE?

04:28.669 --> 04:31.342
IT'S HALLOWEEN.
I'LL GO AS A PUMPKIN.

04:31.342 --> 04:33.344
YOU ARE DUE IN THREE WEEKS.

04:33.344 --> 04:36.847
UNTIL THEN, NO WINDOWS
AND NO PARTIES.
 (sighs)

04:36.847 --> 04:39.009
SO... THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.

04:39.009 --> 04:41.512
WILL YOU HELP ME
WITH A COSTUME?

04:43.314 --> 04:44.455
(chuckles) SURE!

04:44.455 --> 04:48.859
HOW FAMILIAR ARE YOU
WITH POP ICONS FROM THE '70s?

04:52.363 --> 04:55.426
VICTOR, IT'S ME.
I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

04:55.426 --> 04:57.428
I'VE GOTTA BE HONEST,
I'M VERY ANNOYED

04:57.428 --> 05:00.000
THAT YOU'RE NOT COMING HOME
TODAY LIKE YOU PROMISED.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.003
I TOLD YOU I HAVE SOMETHING
VERY IMPORTANT TO TELL YOU,

05:03.003 --> 05:05.506
AND I WANTED TO DO IT IN PERSON,

05:05.506 --> 05:08.008
BUT NOW YOU'RE GONNA BE HOME
FOR ANOTHER WEEK,

05:08.008 --> 05:09.540
AND I CAN'T WAIT.

05:09.540 --> 05:12.543
VICTOR, I'M LEAVING YOU.

05:12.543 --> 05:15.946
I... CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M ENDING MY MARRIAGE

05:15.946 --> 05:17.848
ON A HOTEL VOICE MAIL.

05:17.848 --> 05:19.350
THIS IS VERY TACKY.

05:19.350 --> 05:21.352
YOU'RE FORCING ME TO BE TACKY,
VICTOR.

05:21.352 --> 05:24.455
I AM NOT A TACKY PERSON.
I AM VERY, VERY CLASSY.

05:24.455 --> 05:26.397
(line clicks)
 OH! HANG ON ONE SECOND.

05:26.397 --> 05:27.758
(beep)

05:27.758 --> 05:30.901
HELLO? HEY, CARLOS.
YEAH, I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.

05:30.901 --> 05:32.903
I'M BREAKING UP WITH VICTOR.

05:32.903 --> 05:35.406
NO, HE'S NOT HERE.
HE'S IN WASHINGTON.

05:35.406 --> 05:37.408
YEAH, OKAY, I'LL EXPLAIN LATER.

05:37.408 --> 05:39.009
(beep)

05:39.009 --> 05:40.511
SORRY ABOUT THAT, VICTOR.

05:40.511 --> 05:43.013
UH, ANYWAY, IT'S OVER.

05:43.013 --> 05:45.846
UH, WE BOTH KNOW
IT WASN'T WORKING.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.347
UH, GOOD LUCK ON EVERYTHING,

05:47.347 --> 05:49.520
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
TO CALL ME BACK.

05:49.520 --> 05:51.021
OKAY, BYE-BYE.

05:51.021 --> 05:52.352
(beep)

05:52.352 --> 05:53.954
AH.

05:56.887 --> 06:01.462
I WAS SURPRISED THAT MY DOCTOR
SUGGESTED GENETIC COUNSELING.

06:01.462 --> 06:04.064
I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT
WITH MY LAST BABY.

06:04.064 --> 06:07.398
WELL, YOU WERE 26
WHEN YOU HAD YOUR LAST CHILD.

06:07.398 --> 06:08.539
NOW YOU'RE--

06:08.539 --> 06:10.401
CAREFUL.

06:10.401 --> 06:11.902
OLD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT

06:11.902 --> 06:14.805
FROM THIS PARTICULAR BRANCH
OF MEDICINE.

06:14.805 --> 06:16.146
NICE SAVE.

06:16.146 --> 06:18.409
NOW CAN WE JUST SKIP
TO THE PART

06:18.409 --> 06:20.781
WHERE YOU TELL ME
WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY BABY?

06:20.781 --> 06:22.783
WELL, WE DON'T KNOW
IF ANYTHING'S WRONG.

06:22.783 --> 06:25.486
SEE, WE'RE JUST GOING OVER
YOUR FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY

06:25.486 --> 06:27.788
JUST--JUST
TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE.

06:27.788 --> 06:30.521
OKAY.
MY AUNT ELLA HAS ARTHRITIS.

06:30.521 --> 06:33.424
I HAVE
TWO COUSINS WITH WEBBED FEET,

06:33.424 --> 06:37.868
AND THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF
THIRD NIPPLES ON MY DAD'S SIDE.

06:37.868 --> 06:40.501
APPARENTLY, I MARRIED
INTO CARNY FOLK.

06:40.501 --> 06:44.074
(chuckles)
 OKAY, MIKE,
WHAT ABOUT YOUR FAMILY?

06:44.074 --> 06:45.906
EVERYBODY'S PRETTY HEALTHY.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.108
UH, MY GRANDMOTHER
HAS EPILEPSY.

06:48.108 --> 06:50.110
MY FATHER
HAD HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,

06:50.110 --> 06:52.843
BUT HE'S ON MEDICATION,
SO IT'S FINE NOW.

06:52.843 --> 06:56.116
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"IT'S FINE NOW"? HE'S DEAD.

06:56.116 --> 06:59.590
NO, HE'S NOT.
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT?

06:59.590 --> 07:03.724
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU TOLD ME
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED DATING.

07:03.724 --> 07:07.528
OH. WELL, I'M SORRY IF
I GAVE YOU THAT IMPRESSION.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.560
IT WASN'T AN IMPRESSION.

07:09.560 --> 07:12.803
YOU SAID THOSE WORDS--
"MY FATHER'S DEAD."

07:12.803 --> 07:14.565
(chuckles nervously)
IT'S... COMPLICATED.

07:14.565 --> 07:17.538
HOW CAN IT BE COMPLICATED?
HE'S EITHER DEAD OR ALIVE.

07:17.538 --> 07:20.541
DOES IT SOUND COMPLICATED
TO YOU, MICHELLE?
 (cell phone buzzing)

07:20.541 --> 07:21.942
OH, UM...

07:21.942 --> 07:24.775
WOW, I'M SORRY. I-I'VE GOT
AN EMERGENCY PLUMBING CALL.

07:24.775 --> 07:28.448
I'M GONNA HAVE TO DO THIS LATER.
UH, DON'T WAIT UP.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.620
(scoffs)

07:31.622 --> 07:33.654
(door opens and shuts)

07:33.654 --> 07:38.028
OKAY, SO, UM,
MIKE'S GRANDMOTHER IS EPILEPTIC?

07:38.028 --> 07:39.630
YEAH.

07:39.630 --> 07:42.092
BUT APPARENTLY, HIS DAD
CAN RISE FROM THE DEAD.

07:42.092 --> 07:44.965
SO LET'S HOPE
THE BABY GETS THAT GENE.

07:49.540 --> 07:51.542
HEY.
HOW'D THE P.E.T. SCAN GO?

07:51.542 --> 07:53.043
SHE WAS A REAL TROUPER.

07:53.043 --> 07:55.546
20 MINUTES INSIDE THAT TUBE,
SHE DIDN'T COMPLAIN ONCE.

07:55.546 --> 07:59.049
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS, WE'LL KNOW
IF YOU BEAT THIS SON OF A BITCH.

07:59.049 --> 08:01.982
HEY, DR. RUSHTON
IS VERY OPTIMISTIC.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.784
(Stella) FANTASTIC.
HE'S THE BEST.

08:03.784 --> 08:05.786
HEY, WHAT DO YOU SAY
I DITCH WORK,

08:05.786 --> 08:09.219
AND I TAKE YOU TO THAT...
THAI PLACE FOR LUNCH? LYNETTE?

08:09.219 --> 08:12.192
IS THAT A HOLE?
 WHAT?

08:12.192 --> 08:16.166
IN THE GARDEN THERE. HAS
SOMETHING BEEN DIGGING IN THERE?

08:16.166 --> 08:18.599
OH, IT MIGHT BE A POSSUM.
 AHEM.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.601
I-I SAW ONE
THE OTHER DAY.

08:20.601 --> 08:23.203
YOU SAW A POSSUM,
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME?

08:23.203 --> 08:25.576
DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS FRONT-PAGE NEWS.

08:25.576 --> 08:28.178
WELL, WE GOTTA
DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.

08:28.178 --> 08:30.581
AND WE WILL, SO DO YOU WANT
TO BRING THE KIDS,

08:30.581 --> 08:32.082
OR WOULD YOU PREFER

08:32.082 --> 08:35.885
A, UH, GLORIOUSLY ROMANTIC LUNCH
WITH JUST ME?
 I CAN'T EAT RIGHT NOW, TOM.

08:35.885 --> 08:37.888
I'VE GOT TO GO
TO THE GARDEN CENTER

08:37.888 --> 08:40.190
AND GET SOME FENCING.
GOD, THIS IS ANNOYING!

08:40.190 --> 08:43.754
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DIDN'T
TELL ME WE HAVE A POSSUM!

08:59.309 --> 09:00.841
(sighs)

09:03.914 --> 09:06.917
(pills rattling)

09:19.289 --> 09:21.291
OH, YOU'RE, UM,
YOU'RE UP.

09:21.291 --> 09:23.794
I WAS JUST GONNA TRY
NOT TO WAKE YOU.

09:23.794 --> 09:26.797
DID YOU REALLY THINK I WAS GONNA
LET YOU CRAWL IN BED NEXT TO ME

09:26.797 --> 09:29.339
WITHOUT AN EXPLANATION
FOR YOUR BIZARRE BEHAVIOR?

09:29.339 --> 09:31.341
WELL, WHAT GOOD'S A DREAM

09:31.341 --> 09:33.604
IF IT'S NOT
A LITTLE UNREALISTIC?

09:33.604 --> 09:36.046
I DON'T CARE
WHAT THE ISSUES ARE.

09:36.046 --> 09:38.048
YOU DON'T DENY
YOUR OWN DAD'S EXISTENCE.

09:38.048 --> 09:41.912
MY FATHER'S
IN PRISON FOR MURDER.

09:44.284 --> 09:47.758
SO CAN YOU SEE WHY I MIGHT
HAVE WANTED TO LIE ABOUT HIM

09:47.758 --> 09:49.660
ON A FIRST DATE?

09:49.660 --> 09:53.824
OH, MY GOD.

09:53.824 --> 09:56.226
HE'S IN JAIL FOR MURDER?

09:56.226 --> 09:57.698
YEAH.

09:57.698 --> 10:00.230
HE'S DOING
LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE.

10:04.174 --> 10:07.177
DO YOU SEE HIM? I MEAN, DO YOU
HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM?

10:07.177 --> 10:10.240
UH, I VISIT
A FEW TIMES A YEAR.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.986
WELL,
I'VE GOT TO MEET HIM.

10:15.986 --> 10:19.690
(chuckles) NO, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA.
 WELL, HE'S YOUR FATHER.

10:19.690 --> 10:22.693
I SHOULD KNOW HIM, AND BESIDES,
THAT GENETIC COUNSELOR

10:22.693 --> 10:25.225
SAID WE SHOULD GATHER DATA
ABOUT YOUR FAMILY'S HISTORY.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.758
MAYBE YOU DAD KNOWS
SOMETHING YOU DON'T.

10:27.758 --> 10:30.901
I MEAN, I SHOULD MEET HIM
FOR THE SAKE OF OUR BABY.

10:30.901 --> 10:35.335
WELL, YEAH. FINE.
WE'LL GO SEE HIM.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.367
THANK YOU.

10:48.048 --> 10:50.280
MOM!
WE'RE GONNA BAKE YOU A CAKE

10:50.280 --> 10:52.783
WHEN THE DOCTOR
SAYS YOUR CANCER'S GONE.

10:52.783 --> 10:55.125
GREAT. HERE. GRAB THIS.

10:55.125 --> 10:57.828
WHAT'S THIS STUFF FOR?

10:57.828 --> 11:01.191
YOU KNOW THAT POSSUM
THAT'S BEEN RUINING OUR GARDEN?

11:01.191 --> 11:03.934
YEAH, ME AND PRESTON
NAMED HIM SCRUFFLES.

11:03.934 --> 11:06.797
DON'T GIVE HIM A NAME. HE'S NOT
GONNA BE AROUND MUCH LONGER.

11:06.797 --> 11:08.799
YOU'RE NOT GONNA HURT HIM,
ARE YOU?

11:08.799 --> 11:11.802
HONEY, I PUT UP A FENCE,
AND HE BURROWED RIGHT UNDER IT.

11:11.802 --> 11:14.805
THE MAN AT THE GARDEN CENTER
SAID THESE ARE CRAFTY CREATURES,

11:14.805 --> 11:17.447
AND THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO STOP 'EM.

11:17.447 --> 11:19.449
SO YOU'RE GONNA KILL HIM?

11:19.449 --> 11:21.451
SWEETIE,
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

11:21.451 --> 11:24.254
IF YOU HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN
MOMMY'S BEAUTIFUL GARDEN

11:24.254 --> 11:28.088
AND A GROSS,
MEAN, DIRTY POSSUM,

11:28.088 --> 11:29.820
WHAT WOULD YOU PICK?

11:29.820 --> 11:31.391
SCRUFFLES.

11:31.391 --> 11:32.893
(cage thuds to ground)

11:32.893 --> 11:35.325
OKAY,
WE'RE DONE TALKING HERE.

11:37.027 --> 11:39.299
YOU'RE SENDING ME BACK
TO THE CONVENT?

11:39.299 --> 11:42.302
WELL, YOU CERTAINLY DON'T
SEEM HAPPY HERE, AND I THOUGHT

11:42.302 --> 11:45.705
MAYBE YOU WERE MISSING THE NUNS
AND THE OTHER GIRLS.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.978
OH, WHOOPEE. KNOCKED-UP SLUTS
AND CELIBATE FREAKS.

11:47.978 --> 11:49.740
START THE PARTY. (sighs)

11:49.740 --> 11:53.343
WHATEVER. I DON'T CARE. I JUST
WANT THIS THING OUT OF ME.

11:56.987 --> 12:00.751
YOU KNOW, DANIELLE,
I JUST WANT YOU TO BE AWARE

12:00.751 --> 12:04.755
THAT GIVING UP THIS BABY
MIGHT BE HARDER THAN YOU THINK.

12:04.755 --> 12:06.827
IT WON'T BE A PROBLEM.
TRUST ME.

12:06.827 --> 12:09.830
WELL, YOU SAY THAT NOW,
BUT ONCE YOU'VE HELD YOUR CHILD

12:09.830 --> 12:13.003
AND FELT THAT RUSH OF LOVE,
WELL...

12:13.003 --> 12:14.504
IT CAN CHANGE YOU.

12:14.504 --> 12:16.436
PLEASE. I HATE THIS BABY.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.438
WHAT HAS IT DONE
BUT MAKE ME FAT

12:18.438 --> 12:20.440
AND RUIN AN ENTIRE YEAR
OF MY LIFE?

12:20.440 --> 12:23.774
I'M JUST SAYING, IF I WERE YOU,
I MIGHT BE FEELING--

12:23.774 --> 12:27.317
STOP. WHO SAYS I HAVE TO FEEL
THE SAME THINGS YOU'D FEEL?

12:27.317 --> 12:29.419
I'M NOTHING LIKE YOU.

12:29.419 --> 12:32.082
YOU ALWAYS SAY THAT LIKE
IT'S SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF,

12:32.082 --> 12:35.425
BUT THE DAY I SEE
EVEN A GLIMMER OF MYSELF IN YOU

12:35.425 --> 12:37.027
IS THE DAY THAT I REALIZE

12:37.027 --> 12:39.890
YOU'VE FINALLY STARTED...
(whispers) TO GROW UP.

12:39.890 --> 12:41.761
WELL,
DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.895
NO, ON SECOND THOUGHT,

12:44.895 --> 12:46.236
DO.

12:52.873 --> 12:53.874
HELLO, GABRIELLE.

12:53.874 --> 12:54.875
OH!

12:54.875 --> 12:56.306
(boxes fall to floor)

12:56.306 --> 12:59.379
(panting)
MILTON... YOU SCARED ME.

12:59.379 --> 13:02.052
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
IN WASHINGTON WITH VICTOR.

13:02.052 --> 13:05.055
I WAS.
I GOT TO THE MESSAGES FIRST.

13:05.055 --> 13:08.889
OH.
 YOU CAN'T LEAVE HIM,
GABRIELLE.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.961
WELL, IF HE REALLY
WANTED ME TO STAY,

13:10.961 --> 13:14.464
HE WOULD'VE COME HERE HIMSELF,
INSTEAD OF SICCING DADDY ON ME.

13:14.464 --> 13:16.466
OH, VICTOR
HASN'T HEARD THE MESSAGE.

13:16.466 --> 13:18.969
I ERASED IT.
 OH, GREAT.

13:18.969 --> 13:21.902
NOW I HAVE TO BREAK UP
WITH HIM ALL OVER AGAIN.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.904
YOU KNOW,
THERE'S A LOT OF TALK

13:23.904 --> 13:25.906
ABOUT VICTOR
RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.939
A DIVORCE ON THE EVE
OF A CAMPAIGN COULD BE...

13:28.939 --> 13:30.810
QUITE DAMAGING.

13:30.810 --> 13:34.414
AND YOU FLEW ALL THE WAY HERE
TO TWIST MY ARM?

13:34.414 --> 13:38.949
NO, I HAD SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE SUBTLE IN MIND.

13:38.949 --> 13:42.392
MILTON, THERE IS NO AMOUNT
OF MONEY THAT IS--WOW!

13:42.392 --> 13:44.855
YEAH. YOU START TACKING ON
THOSE ZEROS,

13:44.855 --> 13:46.857
IT GETS HARD TO STOP.

13:46.857 --> 13:49.429
HOLD ON.

13:49.429 --> 13:51.361
THIS CHECK IS DATED
FOR NEXT YEAR.

13:51.361 --> 13:52.602
EXACTLY.

13:52.602 --> 13:54.604
IF YOU WANT THIS MONEY,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE

13:54.604 --> 13:57.467
TO STAY MARRIED TO MY SON
FOR THE NEXT 13 MONTHS.

13:57.467 --> 13:58.869
HUH.

13:58.869 --> 14:01.841
AND ISN'T THERE AN ELECTION
AROUND THAT TIME?

14:01.841 --> 14:04.544
MY SON IS DESTINED
FOR GREATNESS.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.046
HE WILL BE GOVERNOR.

14:06.046 --> 14:08.048
HE COULD BE PRESIDENT.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.881
AND YOU'RE GOING TO
MAKE SURE

14:10.881 --> 14:13.523
HE GOES STRAIGHT TO THE TOP,
AREN'T YOU?

14:13.523 --> 14:17.988
SOMETIMES GREATNESS
NEEDS A LITTLE NUDGE.

14:20.190 --> 14:22.862
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
THERE'S NOTHING THERE?

14:22.862 --> 14:24.364
I'M SORRY, MS. BRITT.

14:24.364 --> 14:27.968
I CHECKED THE NUMBER
YOU GAVE ME THREE TIMES.

14:27.968 --> 14:31.141
THAT OFFSHORE ACCOUNT
SIMPLY DOESN'T EXIST.

14:35.045 --> 14:37.948
WHEREIS THAT $10 MILLION?

14:37.948 --> 14:39.509
WHAT $10 MILLION?

14:39.509 --> 14:42.913
GIVE IT A REST, CARLOS.
YOU MOVED THAT MONEY.

14:42.913 --> 14:45.655
(loudly) FIRST OF ALL,
I DENY HAVING ANY ILLEGAL MONEY,

14:45.655 --> 14:47.357
LET ALONE MOVING IT.

14:47.357 --> 14:49.289
WHY ARE YOU TALKING
LIKE THAT?

14:49.289 --> 14:52.422
I DON'T KNOW. I THOUGHT YOU
MIGHT BE WEARING A WIRE.

14:52.422 --> 14:54.424
(slaps hand)
 YOU'RE PARANOID.
YOU KNOW THAT?

14:54.424 --> 14:56.426
WELL,
DON'T I HAVE REASON TO BE?

14:56.426 --> 14:59.429
AND WHY WOULD YOU CARE
WHERE THE MONEY IS,

14:59.429 --> 15:02.272
UNLESS YOU WERE PLANNING
ON USING IT AGAINST ME?

15:02.272 --> 15:05.135
OH, GOD. YOU THINK YOU ARE
SO CLEVER. WELL, YOU'RE NOT.

15:05.135 --> 15:08.378
IN FACT, YOU--YOU ARE
THE STUPIDEST MAN I'VE EVER MET.

15:08.378 --> 15:11.081
YOU HAVE NO CLUE
WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH,

15:11.081 --> 15:13.043
BUT BELIEVE ME,
YOU'RE GONNA PAY

15:13.043 --> 15:15.485
FOR WHAT
YOU'VE DONE TO ME, CARLOS.

15:15.485 --> 15:17.487
THIS GAME IS NOT OVER.

15:17.487 --> 15:19.990
ACTUALLY, IT KINDA IS,

15:19.990 --> 15:23.093
AND IF YOU HADN'T NOTICED...

15:23.093 --> 15:24.154
I WON.

15:37.107 --> 15:38.038
BREE.

15:38.038 --> 15:41.071
LYNETTE,
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT YOU.

15:41.071 --> 15:43.713
DID YOU GET
YOUR TEST RESULTS YET?

15:43.713 --> 15:46.076
HUH? OH, THE P.E.T. SCAN.
NO, NOT TILL TOMORROW.

15:46.076 --> 15:49.149
LISTEN, I NEED YOUR HELP.
THERE'S A POSSUM IN MY GARDEN.

15:49.149 --> 15:50.720
UGH! I HATE POSSUMS.

15:50.720 --> 15:54.184
NOT AS MUCH AS ME. I PUT OUT
POISON, BUT IT ATE AROUND IT.

15:54.184 --> 15:57.727
I GOT ONE OF THOSE HUMANE TRAPS,
BUT ALL I TRAPPED WAS PENNY.

15:57.727 --> 15:59.729
HOW CAN I HELP?

15:59.729 --> 16:01.631
I WANT A GUN.

16:01.631 --> 16:02.993
REALLY?

16:02.993 --> 16:05.665
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ONE
OF THOSE LIBERAL GUN HATERS.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.667
THAT WAS THE OLD LYNETTE.
THE NEW LYNETTE

16:07.667 --> 16:10.100
KILLS THE POSSUMS
AND LETS GOD SORT 'EM OUT.

16:10.100 --> 16:13.103
WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,
OUR BLEEDING-HEART TOWN COUNCIL

16:13.103 --> 16:16.506
FORBIDS US FROM USING LIVE AMMO
IN OUR OWN BACKYARDS.

16:16.506 --> 16:18.008
WUSSES!

16:18.008 --> 16:20.350
I SUGGEST
YOU GET AN AIR RIFLE.

16:20.350 --> 16:22.052
IT WON'T KILL IT,

16:22.052 --> 16:24.354
BUT IT'LL STING IT ENOUGH
TO KEEP IT AWAY FOR GOOD.

16:24.354 --> 16:27.117
PERFECT.
WHERE CAN I GET ONE?

16:27.117 --> 16:30.160
TRY, UM, GUN CITY ON ROUTE 6
BY THE BAPTIST CHURCH.

16:30.160 --> 16:31.991
TELL THEM I SENT YA,

16:31.991 --> 16:33.993
AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU
A NICE DISCOUNT.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.296
GREAT.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.203
WHAT'S SO URGENT?

16:43.203 --> 16:45.675
CAN'T SAY HELLO TO A GIRL?

16:45.675 --> 16:47.177
GABY, WE HAD A DEAL.

16:47.177 --> 16:49.679
WE WEREN'T GONNA SEE EACH
OTHER FOR SIX MONTHS.

16:49.679 --> 16:52.042
OH, UH, YEAH, ABOUT THAT...

16:52.042 --> 16:54.044
WHAT IF WE MAKE IT 13?

16:54.044 --> 16:58.788
OKAY, NO,
JUST GO WITH ME ON THIS.

16:58.788 --> 17:02.492
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO PROPOSE WILL
GIVE US TOTAL FINANCIAL FREEDOM

17:02.492 --> 17:07.156
AND... HELP A CONNIVING
BILLIONAIRE'S DREAM COME TRUE.

17:07.156 --> 17:09.799
WHOA. WHAT'S THIS FOR?

17:09.799 --> 17:11.800
MILTON LANG DOESN'T WANT ME
TO LEAVE VICTOR

17:11.800 --> 17:13.262
UNTILAFTER
 HE RUNS FOR GOVERNOR.

17:13.262 --> 17:17.067
ONCE THE ELECTION'S OVER,
KA-CHING!

17:17.067 --> 17:19.269
SO BASICALLY,
YOU'RE TAKING MONEY

17:19.269 --> 17:21.611
TO SLEEP WITH A MAN
YOU DON'T LOVE.

17:21.611 --> 17:24.814
GEE, IF THAT WERE A JOB,
WHAT WOULD YOU CALL IT?

17:24.814 --> 17:27.617
I DON'T HAVE
TO SLEEP WITH HIM,

17:27.617 --> 17:30.820
JUST STAY WITH HIM
FOR POLITICAL REASONS.

17:30.820 --> 17:34.424
IT'S BASICALLY A MODELING FEE
FOR A 13-MONTH PHOTO OP.

17:36.186 --> 17:37.587
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

17:37.587 --> 17:41.060
CARLOS, YOU'RE NOT WORKING
RIGHT NOW,

17:41.060 --> 17:44.063
AND YOU KNOW WE'LL NEVER
BE HAPPY IF WE'RE BROKE.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.065
WE NEED THIS.

17:49.699 --> 17:51.401
WHAT IF WE DIDN'T?

17:51.401 --> 17:52.772
HUH?

17:52.772 --> 17:55.705
WHAT IF I HAD
SOME MONEY STASHED AWAY?

17:57.076 --> 17:59.149
OKAY,
REMEMBER A FEW YEARS AGO

17:59.149 --> 18:01.151
WHEN I WAS IN BUSINESS
WITH TANAKA?

18:01.151 --> 18:05.115
I WAS ALWAYS AFRAID THAT
HE WAS GONNA DOUBLE-CROSS ME.

18:05.115 --> 18:07.257
WHICH HE DID.

18:07.257 --> 18:08.688
BUT BEFORE HE DID,

18:08.688 --> 18:11.191
I SKIMMED A LITTLE
OFF THE TOP.

18:11.191 --> 18:14.264
HOW MUCH IS "A LITTLE"?

18:14.264 --> 18:16.396
$10 MILLION.

18:16.396 --> 18:19.599
YOU EMBEZZLED $10 MILLION?

18:23.173 --> 18:24.734
(kissing loudly) MMM.

18:24.734 --> 18:27.607
ACTUALLY, NOW IT'S ONLY ABOUT
$9.5. IT COST ME HALF A MIL

18:27.607 --> 18:30.610
TO HIDE IT FROM THE GOVERNMENT
AND CERTAIN OTHER PEOPLE. MM.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.111
OH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

18:32.111 --> 18:37.147
IF THIS IS TANAKA MONEY, THEN
YOU HAD IT WHEN WE WERE MARRIED?

18:37.147 --> 18:39.749
OKAY, I CAN SENSE
WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS.

18:39.749 --> 18:43.253
WHICH ALSO MEANS YOU HAD IT
WHEN WE GOT DIVORCED.

18:43.253 --> 18:45.555
LOOK, IF I HAD TOLD YOU
ABOUT IT,

18:45.555 --> 18:48.558
YOU'D HAVE TAKEN ME
TO THE CLEANERS.
 CARLOS, WE WERE MARRIED.

18:48.558 --> 18:51.161
I WAS ENTITLED TO HALF
OF EVERYTHING YOU EMBEZZLED.

18:51.161 --> 18:53.363
LOOK, WE'RE BACK TOGETHER NOW.
WHAT DOES IT MATTER?

18:53.363 --> 18:56.266
WELL, IT MATTERS
THAT YOU LIED TO ME.

18:56.266 --> 18:57.767
I CAN'T TRUST YOU.

18:57.767 --> 19:01.441
GABY!
 IF I CAN'T TRUST YOU, I DON'T
THINK I CAN BE WITH YOU.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.142
OH, COME ON!

19:03.142 --> 19:05.245
NO, I'M SERIOUS. AFTER
EVERYTHING I HAVE BEEN THROUGH?

19:05.245 --> 19:07.447
NO! NO, GET OUT!

19:07.447 --> 19:09.449
GABY, YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY
RIGHT NOW.

19:09.449 --> 19:13.223
I HAVE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS,
AND I WANT YOU TO BE WITH ME.

19:13.223 --> 19:16.226
OH, SO YOU WANT ME TO SLEEP
WITH YOU AND TAKE YOUR MONEY.

19:16.226 --> 19:19.259
GEE, IF THAT WERE A JOB,
WHAT WOULD THEY CALL IT?

19:21.561 --> 19:25.195
(Carlos sighs deeply)

19:32.242 --> 19:34.904
THANKS, KID.

19:34.904 --> 19:36.306
BEAR CLAW?

19:36.306 --> 19:38.908
UH, NO.
THANK YOU, NICK.

19:38.908 --> 19:43.213
SO, UH, MIKE SAID YOU HAD
SOME MEDICAL QUESTIONS FOR ME?

19:43.213 --> 19:46.256
UM, YES, THE, UH,

19:46.256 --> 19:50.220
GENETIC COUNSELOR, UM, WANTED
TO KNOW A COUPLE OF THINGS.

19:50.220 --> 19:52.762
UH...

19:52.762 --> 19:58.228
UM, I-IS THERE ANY CANCER
IN YOUR FAMILY?

19:58.228 --> 19:59.429
NO.

19:59.429 --> 20:01.231
GREAT.

20:01.231 --> 20:03.233
UH, DIABETES?

20:03.233 --> 20:04.734
MNH-MNH.

20:04.734 --> 20:06.336
WONDERFUL.

20:06.336 --> 20:07.637
WHO DID YOU KILL?

20:10.380 --> 20:13.243
COULDN'T HAVE COVERED THIS
IN THE CAR?

20:13.243 --> 20:16.386
I THOUGHT
SHE SHOULD HEAR IT FROM YOU.

20:18.548 --> 20:22.522
(inhales sharply)

20:22.522 --> 20:24.554
I KILLED MY BOSS.

20:25.795 --> 20:27.226
UH-HUH. OKAY.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.729
HE WASN'T MY BOSS
WHEN I MET HIM.

20:29.729 --> 20:32.762
HE WAS JUST ANOTHER GUY
ON THE LOADING DOCK, LIKE ME.

20:32.762 --> 20:34.764
A SUPERVISOR'S JOB CAME UP,

20:34.764 --> 20:38.268
AND, UH, WE WERE
BOTH ANGLING FOR IT.

20:38.268 --> 20:41.240
AND THEN ARNIE--
THAT WAS HIS NAME--

20:41.240 --> 20:43.343
HE WENT
TO THE HEAD OF THE COMPANY

20:43.343 --> 20:45.375
AND TOLD HIM
SOME LIES ABOUT ME,

20:45.375 --> 20:48.418
ANDHEGOT THE JOB.

20:48.418 --> 20:49.949
SO YOU KILLED HIM?

20:49.949 --> 20:53.453
NO. I STEWED ABOUT IT
FOR A FEW WEEKS.

20:53.453 --> 20:56.756
I'D SEE ARNIE WALKING AROUND
WITH THAT SMIRK,

20:56.756 --> 21:00.290
AND, UH, AND THAT TIE,
AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,

21:00.290 --> 21:02.862
"YOU KNOW, ARNIE,
YOU DON'T DESERVE THAT JOB.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.864
"YOU DON'T DESERVE THAT TIE,

21:04.864 --> 21:07.337
AND YOU DON'T DESERVE
TO LIVE."

21:07.337 --> 21:08.998
SO YOU KILLED HIM?

21:08.998 --> 21:10.940
NO. I CONFRONTED HIM.

21:10.940 --> 21:13.543
I SAID, "ARNIE,
WHAT YOU DID WASN'T RIGHT."

21:13.543 --> 21:16.045
HE JUST LAUGHED IN MY FACE
AND SAID, UH,

21:16.045 --> 21:18.548
"WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
ABOUT IT?"

21:21.911 --> 21:23.813
THENI KILLED HIM.

21:23.813 --> 21:26.386
UH-HUH.

21:26.386 --> 21:29.519
UH, AND HOW DID YOU...

21:29.519 --> 21:32.862
WITH THE TIE. I THOUGHT
IT WAS A NICE TOUCH.

21:35.665 --> 21:39.829
WELL, NOW YOU KNOW.

21:48.538 --> 21:51.541
(cheering and laughter)

21:51.541 --> 21:56.716
(Oingo Boingo's
"Dead Man Party" playing)

22:00.650 --> 22:03.493
♪♪♪

22:03.493 --> 22:06.356
SORRY. (chuckles)

22:06.356 --> 22:09.359
♪♪♪

22:09.359 --> 22:12.462
(indistinct conversations
and laughter)

22:12.462 --> 22:14.604
HEY, ADAM, KATHERINE.

22:14.604 --> 22:18.538
OR SHOULD I SAY FRANKENSTEIN
AND... MARIE ANTOINETTE?

22:18.538 --> 22:20.109
NICE.

22:20.109 --> 22:23.112
YOU CAME AS A SELF-IMPORTANT
QUEEN WHO LOST ALL HER POWER.

22:23.112 --> 22:26.516
ISN'T THAT
A BIT ON THE NOSE?

22:26.516 --> 22:29.819
LEE MAKING JOKES
ABOUT A QUEEN.

22:29.819 --> 22:32.422
ISN'T THAT A BIT IRONIC?

22:32.422 --> 22:34.954
(growls)

22:34.954 --> 22:37.987
YOU TWO LOOK ADORABLE.

22:37.987 --> 22:41.461
(both chuckle)
 AND WHO ARE YOU
SUPPOSED TO BE?

22:41.461 --> 22:43.633
CHER,
THE BELOVED POP DIVA.

22:43.633 --> 22:45.465
(chuckles)
IT WAS MY MOM'S IDEA.

22:45.465 --> 22:48.468
YOU KNOW, THE WOMAN WHO FREAKED
WHEN SHE FOUND OUT I WAS GAY?

22:48.468 --> 22:49.469
OH.

22:51.471 --> 22:54.474
OH, MY GOD. IS THAT DANIELLE?

22:56.546 --> 22:59.649
I EXPRESSLY FORBADE HER
FROM COMING TONIGHT.

22:59.649 --> 23:02.582
WHO DOES SHE THINK SHE IS?

23:02.582 --> 23:05.384
APPARENTLY, YOU.

23:07.116 --> 23:08.488
DANIELLE, YOU'RE BACK!

23:08.488 --> 23:10.490
(imitating Bree)
I'M NOT DANIELLE.

23:10.490 --> 23:12.792
I AM BREE VAN DE KAMP HODGE.

23:12.792 --> 23:15.765
(chuckles)
 OH, NO, NO, NO.
NO HUGS, PLEASE.

23:15.765 --> 23:19.529
I'M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH
NEEDLESS DISPLAYS OF EMOTION.

23:19.529 --> 23:21.801
YOUR COSTUME LOOKS GREAT.
IT'S SO REAL.

23:21.801 --> 23:24.173
OOH! I COULD SWEAR
I FELT A KICK. (chuckles)

23:24.173 --> 23:26.806
YOU STOP THAT, BABY HODGE.
WE DO NOT KICK PEOPLE,

23:26.806 --> 23:28.738
UNLESS THEY'RE SERVANTS.

23:28.738 --> 23:31.741
(chuckles nervously)
 WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
SHE WAS HOME?

23:31.741 --> 23:34.784
OH, IT'S JUST A QUICK VISIT.
SHE'S DRIVING BACK TOMORROW.

23:34.784 --> 23:37.016
TO SWITZERLAND?

23:37.016 --> 23:41.721
LET'S GO GET SOME CAKE,
DEAR.

23:44.994 --> 23:48.528
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?
 EXACTLY WHAT MY MOTHER WANTS.

23:48.528 --> 23:50.460
YOU DID SAY
TO BE MORE LIKE YOU, RIGHT?

23:50.460 --> 23:52.061
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT,
AND YOU KNOW IT,

23:52.061 --> 23:54.564
AND AS FOR
YOUR LITTLE IMITATION OF ME,

23:54.564 --> 23:56.466
I DON'T SOUND
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

23:56.466 --> 24:01.571
DANIELLE?
WHO ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE?

24:01.571 --> 24:04.073
REALLY, KAREN,
I DON'T THINK OUR LORD IS AMUSED

24:04.073 --> 24:06.075
WHEN WE MAKE LIGHT
OF WITCHCRAFT,

24:06.075 --> 24:08.678
AND YOU MIGHT USE A COASTER.

24:10.780 --> 24:14.724
OH, I GET IT. SHE'S YOU.

24:14.724 --> 24:16.025
(sighs)

24:17.557 --> 24:21.791
I JUST DON'T SEE HOW HE COULD
NOT FEEL BAD ABOUT IT.

24:21.791 --> 24:25.134
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

24:25.134 --> 24:28.167
(vehicles passing in distance)

24:30.900 --> 24:33.903
YOU KNOW,
I EXPECTED TO MEET

24:33.903 --> 24:35.905
A GUY THAT WAS RACKED
WITH REMORSE,

24:35.905 --> 24:37.246
AND INSTEAD,

24:37.246 --> 24:40.980
I'M LOOKING ACROSS THE TABLE
AT THIS...

24:40.980 --> 24:43.613
PERSON. HE'S A PERSON.

24:43.613 --> 24:46.916
YEAH, AN EVIL PERSON.

24:46.916 --> 24:49.759
NO, HE'S A GOOD GUY
WHO DID AN EVIL THING.

24:49.759 --> 24:51.260
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

24:51.260 --> 24:53.022
WELL, I DON'T SEE ONE.

24:53.022 --> 24:56.596
LOOK, HE SNAPPED. IT HAPPENS.
PEOPLE SNAP. I DID.

24:56.596 --> 24:57.897
I KILLED A GUY.

24:57.897 --> 25:00.600
YOU KILLED A CROOKED COP
WHO WAS COMING AFTER YOU.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.031
THAT'S SELF-DEFENSE,

25:02.031 --> 25:05.134
AND EVEN SO,
YOU REGRET IT, RIGHT?
 YES, OF COURSE.

25:05.134 --> 25:07.637
WELL, THAT'S MY POINT.
WHEN GOOD PEOPLE SNAP,

25:07.637 --> 25:10.509
THEY FEEL BAD ABOUT IT.
YOUR DAD DOESN'T.

25:10.509 --> 25:13.512
SUSAN, WHY ARE YOU GETTING
SO WORKED UP OVER THIS?

25:13.512 --> 25:15.585
I DON'T KNOW.
IT JUST BOTHERS ME.

25:15.585 --> 25:18.648
I MEAN... MY GOD, MIKE.

25:18.648 --> 25:20.519
HE'S YOUR DAD.

25:20.519 --> 25:23.553
YEAH, I KNOW,

25:23.553 --> 25:27.627
AND THIS CONVERSATION IS EXACTLY
WHY I TOLD YOU HE WAS DEAD.

25:33.603 --> 25:35.034
LYNETTE!

25:35.034 --> 25:38.067
HONEY, ARE YOU OUT HERE?

25:38.067 --> 25:39.939
SHH!

25:39.939 --> 25:43.042
IS THAT FOR THE POSSUM?

25:43.042 --> 25:46.015
YEAH.

25:46.015 --> 25:48.578
NOW HE'S PLAYING MIND GAMES
WITH ME,

25:48.578 --> 25:50.780
BUT I LAID OUT
SOME HALLOWEEN CANDY.

25:50.780 --> 25:54.654
PRETTY SOON HE'LL GET HUNGRY,
AND WHEN HE DOES...

25:54.654 --> 25:56.956
TRICK OR TREAT.

25:56.956 --> 25:58.788
LYNETTE--

25:58.788 --> 26:00.089
SHH!

26:04.634 --> 26:06.936
SHH! DO YOU HEAR THAT?

26:06.936 --> 26:08.638
HE'S MAKING HIS MOVE.

26:08.638 --> 26:10.640
LYNETTE,
I THINK YOU SHOULD COME INSIDE

26:10.640 --> 26:12.642
AND LIE DOWN
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

26:12.642 --> 26:15.605
NO WAY. HE'S HERE, TOM.
I CAN TELL.

26:17.607 --> 26:20.650
OKAY,
NOW--NOW YOU'RE SCARING ME.

26:20.650 --> 26:22.211
WHY?

26:22.211 --> 26:23.713
LOOK AT YOURSELF.

26:23.713 --> 26:26.716
YOU'VE--YOU'VE DECLARED
JIHAD ON A POSSUM.

26:28.858 --> 26:31.961
THIS IS NOT A JOKE, TOM.
SOMETHING HAS ATTACKED OUR HOME,

26:31.961 --> 26:35.665
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS, YOU DON'T
JUST STAND BY--YOU FIGHT IT.

26:35.665 --> 26:38.768
SCREW THIS CREATURE THAT HAS
COME INTO OUR LIVES UNINVITED

26:38.768 --> 26:40.770
AND IS TRYING TO DESTROY US.

26:42.972 --> 26:46.375
IT WILL NOT DEFEAT ME.

26:51.240 --> 26:53.643
OKAY.

26:57.747 --> 27:01.350
YOU DO
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.

27:03.693 --> 27:05.154
THANK YOU.

27:15.634 --> 27:19.638
SO, BREE, HAVE YOU, UH, PICKED
A NAME FOR THE BABY YET?

27:19.638 --> 27:21.640
NOT YET, BUT I'M THINKING

27:21.640 --> 27:23.642
"YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH"
IF IT'S A BOY,

27:23.642 --> 27:26.676
AND "YOU'LL ALWAYS
DISAPPOINT ME" IF IT'S A GIRL.

27:26.676 --> 27:28.778
(laughter)

27:30.720 --> 27:34.153
OKAY, YOU MADE YOUR POINT.
NOW GO HOME.

27:34.153 --> 27:36.155
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

27:36.155 --> 27:39.158
THIS IS THE MOST FUN
I'VE HAD IN EIGHT MONTHS.
 DO NOT TEST ME, YOUNG LADY,

27:39.158 --> 27:41.660
OR I WILL DRAG YOU
OUT OF HERE MYSELF.

27:41.660 --> 27:44.694
YOU MAKE A SCENE?
HA! THAT'S A LAUGH.

27:44.694 --> 27:46.665
WHAT'S WRONG?

27:46.665 --> 27:49.668
I THINK MY WATER
JUST BROKE.

27:53.072 --> 27:54.774
OH, DEAR HEAVENLY LORD.

27:54.774 --> 27:55.905
(Bob) HEY!

27:55.905 --> 27:58.407
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY RUG?

27:58.407 --> 28:00.109
(scoffs)

28:00.109 --> 28:01.380
DANIELLE!

28:01.380 --> 28:04.183
WE AGREED TO SAVE THAT
TILL THE END OF THE NIGHT.

28:04.183 --> 28:06.185
THE BEST PART OF THE COSTUME,

28:06.185 --> 28:09.358
AND SHE POPS THE WATER BALLOON
WHEN PEOPLE AREN'T EVEN LOOKING.

28:11.160 --> 28:13.222
ORSON! ANDREW!

28:16.866 --> 28:19.899
THINK WE CAN MAKE IT
TO THE HOSPITAL?

28:19.899 --> 28:22.401
I DON'T THINK SO!
IT'S COMING.

28:22.401 --> 28:24.874
OKAY, EVERYBODY,
IN THE HOUSE NOW.

28:31.710 --> 28:34.213
NOT ON THE COUCH.
I JUST HAD IT REUPHOLSTERED.

28:34.213 --> 28:36.215
ANDREW, TAKE YOUR SISTER
INTO THE KITCHEN.

28:36.215 --> 28:38.217
GET SOME TOWELS.
BOIL SOME WATER.

28:38.217 --> 28:40.890
EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE FINE.
I'M A DOCTOR.

28:40.890 --> 28:43.753
YOU'RE A DENTIST! WHAT IF
THERE ARE COMPLICATIONS?

28:43.753 --> 28:47.026
SHOULD AN EMERGENCY ARISE,
WE WILL SIMPLY CALL AN AMULET.

28:47.026 --> 28:48.357
A WHAT?

28:48.357 --> 28:49.728
AMBULANCE.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.061
HOW MANY RUM PUNCHES
DID YOU HAVE?

28:52.061 --> 28:53.863
THERE WAS PUNCH
IN THAT RUM?

28:53.863 --> 28:56.405
I AM GOING BACK
TO GET ADAM.

28:58.968 --> 29:00.810
BREE. BREE, WHAT'S WRONG?

29:00.810 --> 29:02.812
I NEED YOUR SERVICES
AS A DOCTOR,

29:02.812 --> 29:04.814
BUT BEFORE I TELL YOU
WHAT'S GOING ON,

29:04.814 --> 29:07.817
I NEED YOU TO PROMISE THAT
WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO LEARN

29:07.817 --> 29:10.820
WILL BE KEPT
IN STRICTEST CONFIDENCE.
 DOES THIS HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

29:10.820 --> 29:12.822
WITH THE PREGNANCY
YOU'VE BEEN FAKING?

29:12.822 --> 29:15.384
(grunts)

29:15.384 --> 29:17.226
OKAY,
YOU'RE ALMOST THERE.

29:17.226 --> 29:19.929
(grunting and groaning)

29:19.929 --> 29:22.061
DANIELLE,
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.
 PUSH, BABY, PUSH.

29:22.061 --> 29:23.332
AAH!

29:23.332 --> 29:25.334
(gasping heavily)

29:25.334 --> 29:28.868
(knock on door)
 (child shouts indistinctly)

29:28.868 --> 29:32.371
(Parker) ARE THEY HOME?
 (Preston) THE LIGHTS ARE ON.

29:32.371 --> 29:33.873
HERE IT COMES!

29:33.873 --> 29:37.106
(screaming)

29:37.106 --> 29:39.278
IF THEY'RE NOT HOME,
THEN WHAT'S THAT?

29:39.278 --> 29:42.211
PROBABLY JUST A TAPE
THEY PUT ON TO SCARE US.

29:42.211 --> 29:44.213
WELL, YOU KNOW THE RULE.

29:44.213 --> 29:47.256
IF WE DON'T GET OUR TREAT,
THEY GET A TRICK.
 YEAH.

29:47.256 --> 29:48.888
(Porter) COME ON. (giggles)

29:50.890 --> 29:52.862
(baby wailing)
 AND... THANK YOU.

29:52.862 --> 29:54.924
OH. (pants)

29:54.924 --> 29:57.226
OKAY.

29:57.226 --> 30:00.499
(wailing continues)

30:00.499 --> 30:02.872
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL BABY BOY.

30:02.872 --> 30:04.934
(crying loudly)
 SHH.

30:06.535 --> 30:10.209
(screaming)

30:27.897 --> 30:30.399
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

30:30.399 --> 30:32.831
TIRED.

30:34.904 --> 30:37.006
DID ADAM LEAVE?

30:37.006 --> 30:39.008
UH, YEAH, AND HE PROMISED

30:39.008 --> 30:43.072
THAT NO ONE WOULD EVER KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED HERE TONIGHT.

30:43.072 --> 30:46.175
THAT'S GOOD, I GUESS.

30:48.978 --> 30:51.020
IS HE OKAY?

30:53.422 --> 30:55.224
HE'S PERFECT.

30:58.928 --> 31:01.030
HE'S, UM,
HE'S ALL CLEANED UP NOW,

31:01.030 --> 31:04.433
IF... IF YOU WANT TO HOLD HIM.

31:14.944 --> 31:16.976
(baby cooing)

31:16.976 --> 31:18.547
YEAH.

31:18.547 --> 31:19.648
(sniffles)

31:46.375 --> 31:50.439
(coos)

31:50.439 --> 31:53.082
HE'S SO TINY.

31:53.082 --> 31:56.185
HE LOOKS JUST LIKE YOU DID.

32:02.091 --> 32:04.693
DO YOU WANT TO BE ALONE
WITH HIM?

32:07.396 --> 32:09.458
DO YOU WANT ME TO...

32:09.458 --> 32:11.060
TO GO?

32:11.060 --> 32:12.561
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

32:12.561 --> 32:15.965
(coos)

32:15.965 --> 32:19.308
YOU SHOULD TAKE HIM.

32:19.308 --> 32:22.171
ARE YOU SURE?

32:27.276 --> 32:30.649
SWEETHEART, DO YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE?

32:30.649 --> 32:32.982
(sniffles)

32:37.226 --> 32:39.228
NO, IT'S...

32:39.228 --> 32:42.061
THE RIGHT THING TO DO
FOR EVERYONE...

32:44.033 --> 32:47.536
ESPECIALLY HIM.

32:51.440 --> 32:54.573
(baby gurgles)

32:57.446 --> 32:59.448
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

33:02.111 --> 33:04.583
IT'S AWFUL.

33:10.389 --> 33:12.561
(exhales deeply)

33:15.394 --> 33:17.666
I'M GONNA SLEEP NOW.

33:17.666 --> 33:20.499
OKAY, BABY.

33:27.136 --> 33:30.739
(baby coos)

33:30.739 --> 33:32.441
IT'S OKAY, LITTLE ONE.

33:32.441 --> 33:36.545
HERE WE ARE. HERE WE GO.

33:36.545 --> 33:38.647
YES, HERE WE GO.

33:40.018 --> 33:43.021
(exhaling deeply)

33:47.526 --> 33:49.528
SUSAN, HEY, IT'S ME.

33:49.528 --> 33:53.102
UM, SORRY TO LEAVE THIS MESSAGE
ON YOUR MACHINE,

33:53.102 --> 33:55.164
BUT CAN YOU TELL THE OTHER GIRLS

33:55.164 --> 33:58.807
I'M, UH, GOING TO BE BY MYSELF
FOR A WHILE?

33:58.807 --> 34:02.040
I... JUST...

34:02.040 --> 34:04.343
GOING THROUGH SOME STUFF
AND NEED TO THINK.

34:04.343 --> 34:05.744
(horn honks)

34:05.744 --> 34:09.748
UM--OH, GOD, THAT'S MY CAR READY
TO TAKE ME TO THE AIRPORT,

34:09.748 --> 34:12.321
SO I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING
WHEN I GET BACK.

34:12.321 --> 34:13.822
OKAY? LOVE YOU. BYE.

34:13.822 --> 34:16.085
(beep)

34:16.085 --> 34:18.487
THIS IS NICE.

34:18.487 --> 34:22.060
I DIDN'T ORDER A STRETCH,
BUT I'LL TAKE IT.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.263
AH.

34:24.263 --> 34:25.634
VICTOR.

34:25.634 --> 34:27.636
I TRIED REACHING YOU
AT THE HOUSE,

34:27.636 --> 34:29.638
BUT THE MAID SAID
YOU'D MOVED OUT.

34:29.638 --> 34:32.141
I TOOK THE NEXT FLIGHT HOME.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

34:32.141 --> 34:34.803
WELL,
I'M... SORT OF LEAVING YOU.

34:34.803 --> 34:38.277
WELL, I GUESS "SORT OF"
IS BETTER THAN "DEFINITELY."

34:38.277 --> 34:41.150
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO
TO MAKE IT "ABSOLUTELY NOT"?

34:41.150 --> 34:43.152
I'LL DO ANYTHING.
JUST TELL ME.

34:43.152 --> 34:46.185
VICTOR, IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.
WE HAVE MAJOR PROBLEMS,

34:46.185 --> 34:49.188
AND YOU NEVER HAVE TIME TO TALK
ABOUT THEM, LET ALONE FIX 'EM.

34:49.188 --> 34:52.121
WELL, I GUESS
I BETTER MAKE SOME TIME.

34:52.121 --> 34:54.723
LET'S SEE.

34:54.723 --> 34:57.094
HERE'S THIS WEEKEND.

34:58.397 --> 35:00.098
HERE'S NEXT WEEK.

35:00.098 --> 35:03.502
THE WEEK AFTER. LOOK AT THAT.
I'VE GOT A WHOLE MONTH.

35:03.502 --> 35:05.103
YOU BUSY?

35:05.103 --> 35:07.105
VICTOR, I KNOW
YOU'RE ONLY DOING THIS

35:07.105 --> 35:09.578
BECAUSE A DIVORCE WOULD HURT
YOUR RUN FOR GOVERNOR.

35:09.578 --> 35:12.211
(sighs)

35:12.211 --> 35:14.243
WHAT IF I DON'T RUN?

35:16.345 --> 35:17.846
YOU MEAN THAT?

35:17.846 --> 35:20.649
THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION
IS MY FATHER'S DREAM.

35:20.649 --> 35:22.651
YOU KNOW WHAT MY DREAM IS?

35:24.753 --> 35:26.124
YOU.

35:27.626 --> 35:31.430
DON'T RUN AWAY, GABY...

35:31.430 --> 35:35.434
AND IF YOU DO, PLEASE,
TAKE ME WITH YOU.

35:35.434 --> 35:37.766
(sighs)

35:44.743 --> 35:46.575
SO... WHERE'S MIKE?

35:46.575 --> 35:49.147
AT THE MOTEL. I SLIPPED OUT
WITHOUT WAKING HIM.

35:51.250 --> 35:54.152
I'VE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT
THINKING,

35:54.152 --> 35:56.655
AND I HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY TO YOU.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.487
OH?

36:00.359 --> 36:02.861
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

36:02.861 --> 36:06.795
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOU COULD
KILL A MAN AND NOT REGRET IT.

36:08.697 --> 36:10.369
WHY DO YOU CARE?

36:10.369 --> 36:14.343
BECAUSE I AM CARRYING A BABY
THAT HAS YOUR GENES.

36:14.343 --> 36:16.845
IF MY DOCTOR TOLD ME
THAT THERE WAS

36:16.845 --> 36:19.348
SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS BABY--
SOMETHING PHYSICAL,

36:19.348 --> 36:21.210
I COULD HANDLE THAT.

36:21.210 --> 36:23.512
I WOULD PROBABLY
EVEN LOVE IT MORE.

36:23.512 --> 36:28.317
BUT IF MY BABY WAS BORN WITHOUT
A CONSCIENCE, WITHOUT A SOUL,

36:28.317 --> 36:30.819
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WOULD DO.

36:30.819 --> 36:33.922
YOU THINK
I DON'T HAVE A SOUL?

36:33.922 --> 36:36.865
IF YOU CAN'T FEEL
THE TINIEST BIT OF REMORSE

36:36.865 --> 36:40.299
OVER TAKING A HUMAN LIFE...

36:40.299 --> 36:43.702
NO, I DON'T THINK YOU DO.

36:45.404 --> 36:48.337
IF I WERE
TO THINK ABOUT WHAT I DID,

36:48.337 --> 36:51.240
REALLY THINK ABOUT IT,

36:51.240 --> 36:52.911
LAY AWAKE NIGHTS

36:52.911 --> 36:55.444
TRYING TO REMEMBER
THE LOOK ON THAT GUY'S FACE

36:55.444 --> 36:58.216
WHEN I STRANGLED THE LIFE
OUT OF HIM...

37:00.289 --> 37:02.591
PRETTY SOON, I'D GO CRAZY.

37:05.294 --> 37:07.626
I SHOULD GO.

37:07.626 --> 37:10.228
YOU KNOW WHAT IDOREGRET?

37:11.830 --> 37:14.333
WHAT I DID TO MIKE.

37:14.333 --> 37:15.964
WHAT DID YOU DO?

37:15.964 --> 37:20.469
HE WAS A REAL POPULAR KID.
EVERYBODY LIKED MIKEY.

37:20.469 --> 37:23.842
(clicks tongue)
THEN WHEN I GOT SENT AWAY,

37:23.842 --> 37:25.844
SUDDENLY THE WHOLE TOWN

37:25.844 --> 37:28.647
JUST THINKS OF HIM
AS THE SON OF A MURDERER.

37:30.619 --> 37:35.654
HE GOT SOME PRETTY SERIOUS
DEMONS AS A RESULT.

37:38.357 --> 37:41.029
I'M NOT SURE
THAT KIND OF DARKNESS

37:41.029 --> 37:43.362
EVER TRULY GOES AWAY.

37:43.362 --> 37:45.394
WELL, YOU'RE WRONG.

37:45.394 --> 37:46.535
HE'S HAPPY.

37:46.535 --> 37:49.538
HE'S GOT A GOOD JOB
AND A WIFE WHO LOVES HIM

37:49.538 --> 37:51.540
AND A BABY ON THE WAY.

37:51.540 --> 37:55.544
I HAD A LOT GOING FOR ME, TOO,
BEFORE I THREW IT ALL AWAY.

37:57.446 --> 37:59.748
JUST...

37:59.748 --> 38:03.412
KEEP ON EYE ON HIM.

38:03.412 --> 38:05.384
(door unlocks and buzzes)

38:11.920 --> 38:13.722
(door slams)

38:13.722 --> 38:14.923
(lock clicks)

38:21.370 --> 38:22.801
(front door shuts)

38:25.604 --> 38:27.706
EDIE, IF YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR GABY,

38:27.706 --> 38:29.908
SHE JUST LEFT
FOR HER YOGA CLASS.

38:29.908 --> 38:33.442
YOGA...
IS THAT WHAT SHE TOLD YOU?

38:44.993 --> 38:46.995
I'M SORRY.

38:46.995 --> 38:50.659
I KNOW HOW ANGRY
AND HUMILIATED YOU MUST FEEL.

38:50.659 --> 38:53.331
BUT DON'T
TAKE IT ALL OUT ON GABY.

38:53.331 --> 38:54.803
CARLOS SEDUCED HER.

38:54.803 --> 38:57.566
HE HATED YOU
FOR TAKING HIS WIFE,

38:57.566 --> 39:00.569
SO HE DECIDED
TO MAKE A FOOL OUT OF YOU.

39:04.743 --> 39:10.078
I THINK HE DESERVES WHATEVER'S
COMING TO HIM, DON'T YOU?

39:14.623 --> 39:15.924
(feet clomping loudly)

39:15.924 --> 39:19.558
HEY! HEY! HEY, QUIET.
SHE'S NAPPING.

39:19.558 --> 39:21.860
FINALLY. HOW'D YOU
GET HER TO DO THAT?

39:21.860 --> 39:25.764
OH, I-I MADE HER A MARGARITA.
THE TEQUILA DID THE REST.

39:25.764 --> 39:26.935
(car approaches)

39:26.935 --> 39:29.698
(car door opens, shuts)

39:31.099 --> 39:33.642
HMM, IT'S DR. RUSHTON.

39:33.642 --> 39:35.003
HER ONCOLOGIST?

39:37.676 --> 39:38.847
(front door opens)

39:38.847 --> 39:39.948
HEY.

39:39.948 --> 39:42.080
HEY, DR. RUSHTON.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.513
WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

39:44.513 --> 39:47.786
WELL... (sighs) SO MUCH OF
MY JOB IS DELIVERING BAD NEWS,

39:47.786 --> 39:50.158
THAT I REALLY WANTED
TO TELL YOU THIS IN PERSON.

39:50.158 --> 39:54.022
LYNETTE, I GOT THE TEST RESULTS
BACK. YOU'RE CLEAN.

39:55.624 --> 39:57.726
ARE YOU SURE?
 YEAH.

39:57.726 --> 40:00.729
(Stella) OH!
 LYMPH NODES ARE COMPLETELY
CLEAR. CONGRATULATIONS.

40:00.729 --> 40:03.001
I KNEW IT. I KNEW IT!

40:03.001 --> 40:05.604
DID YOU HEAR THAT?
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

40:05.604 --> 40:07.606
THIS IS SO AMAZING.
I'M GONNA GO GET THE KIDS.

40:07.606 --> 40:09.778
HEY, DOC, YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU NEED A MARGARITA.

40:09.778 --> 40:12.781
(laughing)
 AND EVEN IF YOU DON'T,
I AIN'T DRINKING ALONE.

40:45.443 --> 40:47.646
(inhales deeply)

40:51.580 --> 40:54.583
(sighs deeply)

40:57.886 --> 40:59.187
(chuckles)

40:59.187 --> 41:02.861
(inhales and exhales deeply)

41:25.113 --> 41:27.616
(voice breaks) I'M SORRY.

41:27.616 --> 41:31.059
(sobbing)

41:45.003 --> 41:48.677
THERE IS MUCH
TO BE AFRAID OF IN THIS WORLD,

41:48.677 --> 41:52.280
BUT WHAT WE FEAR
HAS NOTHING TO DO

41:52.280 --> 41:54.683
WITH GRUESOME MASKS

41:54.683 --> 41:57.215
OR PLASTIC SPIDERS

41:57.215 --> 42:00.749
OR LIFELIKE MONSTERS.

42:00.749 --> 42:03.622
NO, IT'S THE THOUGHTS
IN OUR HEAD

42:03.622 --> 42:06.695
THAT TERRIFY US THE MOST...

42:10.899 --> 42:14.733
WHAT IF SHE COMES TO REGRET
HER DECISION?

42:16.765 --> 42:20.038
WHAT IF
HE REALLYISUNHAPPY?

42:22.070 --> 42:26.675
WHAT IF THE CHANCE FOR LOVE
HAS PASSED FOREVER?

42:28.947 --> 42:32.981
HOW DO WE CONQUER
THESE TERRIFYING THOUGHTS?

42:32.981 --> 42:36.054
WE START BY REMINDING OURSELVES

42:36.054 --> 42:38.727
WHAT DOES NOT KILL US...

42:38.727 --> 42:41.730
JUST MAKES US STRONGER.
