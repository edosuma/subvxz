00:07.780 --> 00:09.589
Previously, on Ray Donovan...

00:09.590 --> 00:11.379
Do you think about it?

00:11.380 --> 00:12.888
You think about what you did?

00:14.515 --> 00:16.475
I shot him, he's dead.
What's the difference?

00:18.602 --> 00:20.312
Got what he deserved.

00:21.770 --> 00:22.879
Aah!

00:22.880 --> 00:24.774
Jesus, Pop! Will you stop?

00:24.775 --> 00:28.609
I taped every fuckin' thing
Jimmy ever said to me.

00:40.280 --> 00:43.085
_

00:47.130 --> 00:49.091
Fuck this.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.686
Are you still workin'
for that piece a shit?

01:01.687 --> 01:05.022
After what he did to your sister?

01:13.570 --> 01:15.280
Aah!

01:28.589 --> 01:30.629
What the fuck?

01:30.630 --> 01:32.340
Oh, shit!

01:33.220 --> 01:34.920
Jas!

01:51.904 --> 01:53.905
God damn it, I said stop... Uhh...

01:53.906 --> 01:55.859
On the ground.

03:07.740 --> 03:10.819
Daryll said that you
went crazy on that cop.

03:10.820 --> 03:13.109
He said that you shot him like 20 times.

03:13.110 --> 03:15.779
I shot him, he's dead.
What's the difference?

03:15.780 --> 03:17.239
You don't feel bad?

03:18.400 --> 03:21.160
You don't feel bad for the families?

03:21.170 --> 03:23.739
No, I don't feel bad.

03:23.740 --> 03:25.319
He got what he deserved.

03:27.340 --> 03:29.039
How 'bout Lieutenant Radulovic?

03:29.040 --> 03:31.379
Did he get what he deserved?

03:31.380 --> 03:32.679
Shot multiple times,

03:32.680 --> 03:34.609
decapitated with a fucking chainsaw

03:34.610 --> 03:35.883
and dumped like trash.

03:35.884 --> 03:40.450
And Officer Clancy. And Officer Bianchi.

03:42.560 --> 03:44.319
They took my daughter.

03:44.320 --> 03:48.179
Why? Why did they take your daughter?

03:48.180 --> 03:50.419
Because I knew what they were doin'.

03:50.420 --> 03:52.940
What were they doing?

03:52.950 --> 03:55.689
Runnin' a kickback scam
through Arthur Kill prison.

03:55.690 --> 03:57.399
- Who was?
- The cops and a judge

03:57.400 --> 04:01.159
named Scholl... IAB already
had an investigation...

04:01.160 --> 04:04.699
a guy named Lake, but, uh...

04:04.700 --> 04:07.080
guess you know what happened to him.

04:10.020 --> 04:11.750
Who killed Lake?

04:14.960 --> 04:16.199
We makin' a deal or what?

04:16.200 --> 04:18.540
Who killed Lake?

04:27.660 --> 04:29.099
Radulovic.

04:29.100 --> 04:31.520
Under orders from Feratti.

04:33.380 --> 04:36.139
Wait a minute... so you're tellin' me

04:36.140 --> 04:37.719
that the Mayor of New York City

04:37.720 --> 04:40.029
called a hit on an IAB investigator?

04:40.030 --> 04:41.939
That's what I just said.

04:41.940 --> 04:43.899
Can you prove it?

04:43.900 --> 04:46.239
No.

04:46.240 --> 04:48.910
But what if I can bring in Judge Scholl?

06:44.730 --> 06:46.760
Swear to God, you haven't heard music

06:46.770 --> 06:48.439
till you hear it on this system.

06:48.440 --> 06:50.359
It's like being there live.

07:03.240 --> 07:05.159
Fine. You're taking your life

07:05.160 --> 07:06.879
in your own hands.

07:06.880 --> 07:10.429
It's worth it if you'll dance with me.

07:14.840 --> 07:16.739
Holy shit!

07:16.740 --> 07:18.419
This is mind-blowing.

07:18.420 --> 07:19.639
Yeah, I told you.

07:59.390 --> 08:01.279
- I'll cover ya.
- I said I'd have it.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.840
You don't need to cover for me.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.999
Jesus, Bridge... you're
like a fuckin' bank teller.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.033
- Where'd you get all that?
- Babysitting.

08:12.040 --> 08:13.609
What?

08:13.610 --> 08:14.839
Nothin'.

08:14.840 --> 08:16.499
Brendan Donovan!

08:16.500 --> 08:17.559
What?

08:17.560 --> 08:19.699
- Easy.
- You steal money

08:19.700 --> 08:22.499
- from your own family.
- Grocery money.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.039
Grocery money?

08:24.040 --> 08:25.839
Pop-Tarts.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.080
You buy these?

08:40.400 --> 08:41.929
Yeah, why?

08:43.039 --> 08:44.419
Nothing.

08:44.420 --> 08:46.026
They're good.

08:51.420 --> 08:52.679
You make me one a those?

08:52.680 --> 08:54.380
Sure.

08:55.700 --> 08:56.950
Need you to put on a suit

08:56.953 --> 08:58.413
and go into Staten Island today.

08:58.414 --> 08:59.872
A suit?

08:59.873 --> 09:02.000
Yeah.

09:13.200 --> 09:14.589
Oh!

09:14.590 --> 09:17.779
Thank you, Terry.

09:17.780 --> 09:19.160
W-you're welcome.

09:19.170 --> 09:20.739
Oh...

09:20.740 --> 09:22.799
I'm sorry to put you to the trouble.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.019
I didn't know who else I could ask.

09:25.020 --> 09:26.699
It's all right.

09:26.700 --> 09:30.189
Oh, it belonged to my grandmother.

09:30.190 --> 09:31.499
How you feelin'?

09:31.500 --> 09:32.979
Never better.

09:32.980 --> 09:34.899
You know the drip they have me on...

09:34.900 --> 09:38.659
well, it's like a martini
on an empty stomach.

09:38.660 --> 09:40.199
Sláinte.

09:41.420 --> 09:43.330
How are you feeling?

09:43.333 --> 09:44.579
All right.

09:44.580 --> 09:48.713
Oh, a positive attitude
is everything, right?

09:49.880 --> 09:52.630
Promise me you'll take
better care of yourself.

09:52.634 --> 09:56.720
Take your meds. Go to physical therapy.

09:56.721 --> 09:57.879
Sure, I will.

09:57.880 --> 10:00.379
That didn't sound so convincing.

10:00.380 --> 10:02.602
I can't make promises
I'm not gonna keep.

10:02.603 --> 10:05.079
Sweetheart...

10:05.080 --> 10:08.139
the man you are going to be

10:08.140 --> 10:12.560
is going to be standing
on top of a mountain

10:12.570 --> 10:15.779
made of the dead versions of yourself.

10:29.260 --> 10:31.199
I don't know yet.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.359
- I may go shopping.
- Okay.

10:40.515 --> 10:42.779
- Love you.
- Love you too.

10:42.780 --> 10:44.349
I'll see you later.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.399
We need to talk.

11:19.400 --> 11:21.699
Jesus, not out here.

11:21.700 --> 11:23.619
Not in there either.

11:23.620 --> 11:25.400
Why not?

11:29.080 --> 11:31.600
I found this in my office last night.

12:03.920 --> 12:06.929
You know where, uh, Frankie Lee is?

12:18.071 --> 12:19.860
Afternoon.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.900
I'm looking for a guy named Frankie Lee.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.034
Shut the door.

12:27.620 --> 12:30.159
I'm Frankie Lee.

12:30.160 --> 12:32.179
I understand that, uh,

12:32.180 --> 12:33.961
you know how to move private stock.

12:33.962 --> 12:37.089
- Who told you that?
- My sister-in-law knows a guy

12:37.090 --> 12:39.675
who, you know, knows a guy.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.589
What kinda stocks?

12:41.590 --> 12:44.514
Twenty percent of Sullivan Industries.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.659
Estimated valuation pre-IPO

12:56.660 --> 12:58.359
is 2.4 billion.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.899
Holy shit!

13:00.900 --> 13:02.640
That much, huh?

13:02.650 --> 13:04.367
Where's the paper?

13:04.368 --> 13:06.619
My, uh, my son has it.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.203
It's in my other son's name.

13:08.204 --> 13:10.913
You always sell things
that don't belong to you?

13:10.914 --> 13:13.059
Basically, I'm one of the founders

13:13.060 --> 13:15.369
of Sullivan Industries, okay?

13:15.370 --> 13:17.419
It's my stock. It's
just in my son's name.

13:17.420 --> 13:19.399
Come back when you got the paper.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.579
Wait, wait... help me out here.

13:24.580 --> 13:26.499
Gimme something to convince him.

13:26.500 --> 13:29.517
How much do we lose,
uh, convertin' it to cash?

13:31.420 --> 13:33.059
Will you take Bitcoin?

13:33.060 --> 13:34.599
What the fuck is that?

13:34.600 --> 13:37.579
You want old-fashioned cash

13:37.580 --> 13:39.152
and you want to keep this deal quiet,

13:39.153 --> 13:42.579
I can get you 65, 75 million.

13:42.580 --> 13:45.491
- Minus my 20 percent.
- Whoa!

13:45.492 --> 13:47.701
- That's a big haircut, Frankie.
- You don't like it,

13:47.702 --> 13:49.119
put your shit on eBay.

13:49.120 --> 13:52.089
Ooh.

14:02.500 --> 14:05.079
Should be the last one.

14:05.080 --> 14:07.070
Are you sure?

14:08.550 --> 14:09.682
Yeah.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.139
What are you doin'?

14:15.140 --> 14:16.309
Calling the mayor.

14:16.310 --> 14:18.219
Who do you think ordered all this?

14:18.220 --> 14:19.269
Feratti?

14:19.270 --> 14:21.879
He won't come after me.

14:21.880 --> 14:23.612
He's in as deep as I am.

14:23.613 --> 14:27.569
IAB already knows about the prison scam.

14:27.570 --> 14:30.219
They just don't know
who the players are.

14:30.220 --> 14:32.579
My guess is Feratti's
tryin' to pin it on you.

14:39.070 --> 14:41.619
I got a friend inside, a detective.

14:41.620 --> 14:44.759
Trust me, Judge... they don't
want us, they want the mayor.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.630
What kind of a deal did they offer you?

14:49.639 --> 14:50.719
Immunity.

14:50.720 --> 14:53.219
Bullshit.

14:53.220 --> 14:55.719
I cooperate, I walk.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.779
I'm a fuckin' judge, Ray.

14:57.780 --> 14:59.732
They're never gonna let me walk.

15:04.650 --> 15:06.639
You give them Feratti,

15:06.640 --> 15:08.319
they'll give you anything you want.

15:08.320 --> 15:11.540
Call me when you're ready to talk.

15:19.340 --> 15:20.889
Terry!

15:20.890 --> 15:23.059
- Oh, hey.
- What's going on?

15:23.060 --> 15:24.819
We haven't seen you in forever.

15:24.820 --> 15:26.879
Oh... oh, you know, fam... family stuff.

15:26.880 --> 15:29.209
Oh. I'm actually with
somebody else right now.

15:29.210 --> 15:32.039
After your first two no-shows,
we took you off the schedule.

15:32.040 --> 15:33.460
Aw, that's all... I-I can just go.

15:33.470 --> 15:35.599
No, no, no, you're both in LSVT,

15:35.600 --> 15:37.279
so I can put you two together.

15:37.280 --> 15:38.760
Come on!

15:48.860 --> 15:50.839
Terry, this is Artie.

15:50.840 --> 15:53.035
He'll be your partner today.

15:53.036 --> 15:55.119
Pleasure to meet you, Terry.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.998
I got ten more to go.

16:18.061 --> 16:22.230
Ladies, gentlemen, non-binary
members of the jury,

16:22.231 --> 16:25.023
the evidence that I will
submit shortly will show,

16:25.024 --> 16:26.849
as clear as day...

16:26.850 --> 16:28.840
the facts of this case.

16:28.850 --> 16:31.109
You will see on CCTV footage

16:31.110 --> 16:34.679
that my client fell from
a second-floor balcony.

16:34.680 --> 16:36.979
You will see on CCTV footage

16:36.980 --> 16:40.999
the railing of that balcony
in obvious disrepair.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.580
Yeah.

16:44.587 --> 16:46.255
The judge's wife made me.

16:46.256 --> 16:48.240
Good.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.579
- What's wrong?
- Nothin'.

17:16.579 --> 17:18.599
What are you cryin' for?

17:21.119 --> 17:22.939
Did you break up with your boyfriend?

17:22.940 --> 17:25.180
Mind your own fuckin' business, okay?

17:57.880 --> 18:00.700
Don't go.

18:00.705 --> 18:03.039
Bridget...

18:03.040 --> 18:04.980
please don't leave me.

18:08.300 --> 18:10.380
Can you just talk to me about this?

18:10.381 --> 18:13.780
Li... You can't just walk
away from everyth...

18:17.972 --> 18:20.799
Bridget...

18:20.800 --> 18:23.979
I love you so much.

18:23.980 --> 18:27.379
And I know that you
think that I fucked up,

18:27.380 --> 18:28.919
but I didn't.

18:28.920 --> 18:31.389
I didn't... everything I
did was to protect you.

18:31.390 --> 18:33.519
You wore a fucking wire.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.279
They already have a case on your dad.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.279
No, they don't! They didn't have a case.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.519
They have you, and they
have your fucking wire.

18:39.520 --> 18:41.519
You don't get it... they
were gonna arrest everybody.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.679
So you turn against me and my dad...

18:43.680 --> 18:45.179
- Not you!
- And my whole fucking family?

18:45.180 --> 18:47.164
Not you... this whole
thing was to save you!

18:47.165 --> 18:48.979
You did it to save yourself.

18:48.980 --> 18:51.439
They have evidence. They have proof.

18:51.440 --> 18:52.507
They have fingerprints.

18:52.508 --> 18:54.499
They have blood.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.259
Don't you get that?

18:56.260 --> 19:00.119
That all of us, we're all just fucked.

19:00.120 --> 19:02.930
That's the only reason I
wore a wire was to save you,

19:02.934 --> 19:04.644
'cause you didn't kill anybody.

19:06.020 --> 19:08.699
I never wanna see you again.

19:16.110 --> 19:18.739
- Bridget Donovan.
- Yeah?

19:18.740 --> 19:20.460
I'm Detective Perry with NYPD.

19:20.470 --> 19:22.959
Can you step over here,
hands on the hood?

19:22.960 --> 19:25.560
Bags down, hands on the hood of the car.

19:41.760 --> 19:44.240
God... Fuck!

19:48.040 --> 19:49.699
Hey, hey, no, no, no, no!

19:49.700 --> 19:51.479
Hold on! We had a deal!

19:51.480 --> 19:55.020
Come on! Fuck!

19:55.027 --> 19:57.550
Ah...

19:58.460 --> 20:00.610
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

20:18.250 --> 20:19.886
Whoa!

20:35.310 --> 20:43.199
Ahh...

20:43.200 --> 20:45.559
Good! Do this twice a day at home.

20:45.560 --> 20:47.954
You'll start to notice a big difference.

20:47.955 --> 20:50.839
Yeah... my neighbors'll start to think

20:50.840 --> 20:52.209
I lost my fuckin' mind.

20:55.960 --> 20:58.799
I have a neighbor who pulls
her children away from me

20:58.800 --> 21:00.719
on the sidewalk.

21:00.720 --> 21:02.634
I can't blame her. I mean, I'm...

21:02.635 --> 21:05.499
I'm shaking and I lose
my balance sometimes.

21:05.500 --> 21:06.933
She must think I'm an alcoholic.

21:06.934 --> 21:08.760
I am an alcoholic.

21:08.770 --> 21:11.771
And I make a mean martini,
shaken, not stirred.

21:13.120 --> 21:16.979
Ahh...

21:47.560 --> 21:49.550
You certainly know how
to send a message.

21:49.559 --> 21:52.429
No, here's my message, Declan.

21:52.430 --> 21:55.689
You killed her, so you explain
her body to the cops.

21:55.690 --> 21:57.479
I want those fuckin' papers.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.519
You bring me what you promised,

21:59.520 --> 22:00.945
and I'll give you the briefcase.

22:00.950 --> 22:04.959
You wanna tell me what's goin' on here?

22:04.960 --> 22:06.157
Hmm?

22:23.240 --> 22:25.260
Yeah.

22:25.261 --> 22:27.129
I got problems.

22:27.130 --> 22:28.619
Okay.

22:28.620 --> 22:30.499
Declan went after your brother.

22:30.500 --> 22:32.430
- Who?
- Daryll.

22:32.435 --> 22:34.769
For the stocks.

22:34.770 --> 22:37.309
He made a fuckin' mess of things.

22:37.310 --> 22:39.640
Why you callin' me?

22:39.650 --> 22:42.620
Your brother's holed up
in some shitty motel,

22:42.630 --> 22:45.680
the Lightning Motel out in Queens.

22:47.240 --> 22:48.639
I can't right now.

22:48.640 --> 22:50.450
Look, I don't want this to escalate

22:50.453 --> 22:52.621
into a fuckin' war between our families.

22:52.622 --> 22:54.659
I'll call ya later.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.275
Something wrong?

23:16.276 --> 23:18.688
He's still fucking following me.

23:18.689 --> 23:20.849
Mayor's office. Can you hold please?

23:20.850 --> 23:23.239
No, Avis, I can't hold.
This is Judge Scholl.

23:23.240 --> 23:25.260
I need to speak to the mayor right away.

23:25.270 --> 23:28.399
He's in a meeting. May I
take a message please?

23:28.400 --> 23:32.010
Tell him to fucking call me.

23:50.760 --> 23:52.597
_

23:52.598 --> 23:54.599
- That's the daughter.
- Bridget Donovan?

23:54.600 --> 23:57.180
Well, it gets better and better.

24:17.560 --> 24:20.959
Your father told me what
those officers did to you.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.039
How they kidnapped you,
held you for days.

24:24.040 --> 24:26.499
I'm sorry.

24:26.500 --> 24:30.386
I really am. That must
have been terrifying.

24:31.540 --> 24:34.432
Were you thinking about that
when you cut their heads off?

24:38.100 --> 24:40.620
I'm not sure I know what you mean.

24:40.630 --> 24:42.523
Then let me walk you through it.

24:42.524 --> 24:45.760
On the night of November 7th last year,

24:45.770 --> 24:51.364
you were being held hostage
at a motel in Staten Island.

25:01.120 --> 25:03.749
They got Bridget.

25:03.750 --> 25:06.080
Cops.

25:06.088 --> 25:10.460
They came to our apartment.
They took her in.

25:10.467 --> 25:13.509
You know, I... I did it for her.

25:13.510 --> 25:17.060
They promised they wouldn't
charge her if I would.

25:17.070 --> 25:18.960
I only did it for her.

25:56.280 --> 25:57.870
Hey, Smit.

25:59.740 --> 26:01.819
Smitty, was that Ray?

26:01.820 --> 26:05.230
Was that Ray that, uh, took off so fast?

26:05.231 --> 26:08.019
You know where he's goin'?

26:08.020 --> 26:10.569
Know when he's comin' back, Smit?

26:10.570 --> 26:13.010
I dunno.

26:15.260 --> 26:17.039
Anybody heard from Daryll?

26:17.040 --> 26:18.970
I dunno, I dunno.

26:20.720 --> 26:22.860
You don't know much, do ya?

26:25.940 --> 26:28.169
Oh, God!

26:28.170 --> 26:31.420
What's the matter?

26:33.420 --> 26:36.719
What's the matter, kid?

26:36.720 --> 26:40.319
What's the matter? Hey, talk to me.

26:40.320 --> 26:42.379
You okay?

26:42.380 --> 26:44.009
I used to go ten rounds

26:44.010 --> 26:45.779
and hardly break a sweat.

26:45.780 --> 26:47.659
You were a boxer?

26:47.660 --> 26:50.340
Yeah. Look at me now.

26:52.400 --> 26:55.779
What do you do for work?

26:55.780 --> 26:58.079
I'm retired for the most part,

26:58.080 --> 26:59.952
but I still see a few patients.

26:59.953 --> 27:02.579
- Are you a doctor?
- Yeah.

27:02.580 --> 27:04.498
Well, maybe you can cure yourself.

27:04.499 --> 27:07.239
Not that kind.

27:07.240 --> 27:09.837
- Well, what kind?
- Psychiatrist.

27:14.270 --> 27:15.919
- I see.
- Naw.

27:15.920 --> 27:18.219
I don't know nothin'
about that kinda shit.

27:18.220 --> 27:20.589
Goin' to see a doctor to talk or...

27:20.590 --> 27:23.723
or worse, goin' to get pills
to make your dick soft.

27:23.724 --> 27:25.959
But my kid brother, he
goes to see one-a you.

27:25.960 --> 27:28.021
I mean, he says it works, so...

27:28.022 --> 27:30.479
maybe I don't know shit about shit.

27:30.480 --> 27:33.799
Might help. I see one.

27:33.800 --> 27:35.169
You do?

27:35.170 --> 27:37.439
Everybody in my profession
has a therapist.

27:37.440 --> 27:39.779
That's why they're in my profession.

27:39.780 --> 27:42.379
Well, it must be fuckin' hard bein' sick

27:42.380 --> 27:44.419
and tryin' to help sick people.

27:44.420 --> 27:47.779
Well, actually, it helps me
take my mind off myself.

27:49.660 --> 27:52.479
You'd have a full-time job in my family.

27:52.480 --> 27:55.630
Bein' a Donovan family therapist.

27:55.632 --> 27:59.160
You could become fuckin'
rich if we had any money.

28:00.920 --> 28:02.719
I'd better get going.

28:02.720 --> 28:04.219
H-hey, hey, listen,

28:04.220 --> 28:07.349
if... if you want a
drink or somethin'...

28:07.350 --> 28:09.309
you just let me know, a'ight?

28:09.310 --> 28:10.640
Bye, Terry.

28:10.650 --> 28:12.620
It was a real pleasure talking with you.

28:17.655 --> 28:19.819
Go to the courthouse right away.

28:19.820 --> 28:22.280
Tail the judge. Make sure he sees ya.

28:23.560 --> 28:25.040
A'ight.

28:31.560 --> 28:33.379
So...

28:33.380 --> 28:35.923
you fed a little cheese
to the cops... so what?

28:37.480 --> 28:39.799
You were trying to save your wife.

28:39.800 --> 28:42.030
I should kill myself.

28:43.510 --> 28:47.899
People pass judgment on rats.

28:47.900 --> 28:49.849
But few understand

28:49.850 --> 28:51.499
what it's like to be under
that kinda pressure.

28:51.500 --> 28:54.439
Everyone thinks that they can hold up.

28:54.440 --> 28:56.760
The truth is, everyone's a rat.

28:59.040 --> 29:01.679
At one point or another.

29:01.680 --> 29:03.359
It's human nature.

29:03.360 --> 29:05.340
No, it's not.

29:06.800 --> 29:10.369
Even Ray ratted me out.

29:10.370 --> 29:11.959
Put me in prison.

29:11.960 --> 29:14.859
I ratted other people out
in order to survive.

29:14.860 --> 29:17.160
You do what you gotta do.

29:17.170 --> 29:19.633
You'll be all right.

29:21.900 --> 29:25.139
You didn't rat on me, did ya?

29:25.140 --> 29:26.719
No.

29:26.720 --> 29:28.979
I didn't say anything about you.

29:28.980 --> 29:31.699
That's... that's a good boy.

29:31.700 --> 29:35.340
Hey... hey.

29:36.300 --> 29:39.099
You're aces with me, kiddo, huh?

29:39.100 --> 29:41.160
You're aces with me.

29:41.170 --> 29:43.819
Now, why don't you
take your old granddad

29:43.820 --> 29:46.259
over to the bank?

29:46.260 --> 29:48.019
The bank? Why?

29:48.020 --> 29:50.912
Well, a dead man can't
open a bank account,

29:50.913 --> 29:53.219
and I need a place where I can receive

29:53.220 --> 29:54.679
wire transfers.

29:54.680 --> 29:56.789
Now, you do this for me,

29:56.790 --> 30:00.399
there's $100,000 in it for ya.

30:00.400 --> 30:02.589
See?

30:02.590 --> 30:05.240
Things'll get quite
rosy, ya hang with me.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.520
Let's go.

30:49.930 --> 30:51.159
Mayor Feratti's office.

30:51.160 --> 30:52.599
I need to speak to the mayor now.

30:52.600 --> 30:53.609
I'm sorry, but he's in a meeting.

30:53.610 --> 30:55.599
Avis, I don't give a
shit what he's doing.

30:55.600 --> 30:57.579
Tell Feratti that Judge Scholl

30:57.580 --> 30:59.419
is about to burn his fucking
life down to the ground

30:59.420 --> 31:00.969
if he doesn't speak to me now.

31:00.970 --> 31:02.819
Hold, please.

32:28.690 --> 32:30.649
Yeah.

32:30.650 --> 32:32.879
Judge Scholl keeps
calling me. He's paranoid.

32:32.880 --> 32:34.780
Thinks somebody's bugging his office.

32:34.786 --> 32:35.819
Yeah?

32:35.820 --> 32:38.244
Saying irrational things,
making threats. Honestly,

32:38.245 --> 32:40.039
I think he's having
some kinda breakdown.

32:40.040 --> 32:41.499
I'll talk to him.

32:59.019 --> 33:01.437
- Daryll.
- Hey, Ma.

33:01.438 --> 33:03.689
What's going on, son? Everything okay?

33:03.690 --> 33:07.019
Yeah, uh, everything's great,
you know, really good.

33:07.020 --> 33:08.859
Is it really... I mean,
you telling me the truth?

33:08.860 --> 33:10.779
Ma, everything is cool.

33:10.780 --> 33:13.119
Well, all right, that's good to hear.

33:13.120 --> 33:15.099
Thank goodness.

33:15.100 --> 33:17.410
I'm gonna be, uh, takin' a trip.

33:17.412 --> 33:18.579
With Mickey?

33:18.580 --> 33:21.950
No. No, not with Mickey.

33:21.958 --> 33:23.543
You were right about Dad.

33:23.544 --> 33:26.504
So I'm gonna be doin' my own thing.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.422
But I-I just wanted to hear your voice.

33:28.423 --> 33:29.591
Daryll, what's goin' on?

33:29.592 --> 33:31.159
Ma, nothing!

33:31.160 --> 33:33.060
Look, sweetheart, if you're in trouble,

33:33.070 --> 33:35.239
if you need somethin'...

33:35.240 --> 33:37.973
there's nothin' you could do,
there's nothin' you could say

33:37.974 --> 33:40.599
that could ever make me
stop loving you, Daryll.

33:40.600 --> 33:42.299
Hey, Ma, actually, I gotta go.

33:42.300 --> 33:44.819
- But, uh, love you.
- Daryll.

33:44.820 --> 33:46.600
Daryll...

34:35.080 --> 34:36.679
I've got good news.

34:36.679 --> 34:38.199
Donovan just flipped Judge Scholl.

34:38.201 --> 34:40.239
- Son of a bitch!
- If we can draw

34:40.239 --> 34:41.799
a straight line from Scholl to Feratti,

34:41.800 --> 34:44.916
corruption to murder,
we take down the mayor.

34:54.880 --> 34:57.379
They think it's terrorists.

34:57.380 --> 35:00.389
The police. They're... assuming

35:00.390 --> 35:03.599
that it has something to
do with one of my cases.

35:06.480 --> 35:08.460
Brought in the FBI.

35:10.480 --> 35:13.139
They'll probably...

35:13.140 --> 35:15.679
turn... every fuckin' Muslim

35:15.680 --> 35:18.200
I've ever had in my
courtroom inside out.

35:20.720 --> 35:22.659
What was I supposed to say?

35:22.660 --> 35:24.460
The fuckin' mayor of New York City

35:24.470 --> 35:26.041
had me car bombed?

35:27.360 --> 35:29.040
Where the fuck are you taking me?

35:32.589 --> 35:34.859
Jesus.

35:34.860 --> 35:39.470
Uh... a-a-are you sure
you trust this cop?

35:41.220 --> 35:42.900
I trust her.

35:44.260 --> 35:47.099
I can't go to prison.

35:47.100 --> 35:49.898
I'm a fucking judge. They'll kill me.

35:54.778 --> 35:56.569
Who is this?

35:56.570 --> 35:59.099
It's Claudette.

35:59.100 --> 36:01.034
I got your number from Mickey.

36:01.035 --> 36:04.179
- What do ya want?
- It's Daryll.

36:04.180 --> 36:06.159
I think he's in real trouble.

36:06.160 --> 36:08.859
He called me, and there's just
something about his voice.

36:08.860 --> 36:11.039
He just, h...

36:11.040 --> 36:13.003
It-it-it scared me.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.629
- Where is he?
- I don't know where he is.

36:15.630 --> 36:17.199
I've called him three times now.

36:17.200 --> 36:19.319
He's not answerin' his phone.

36:19.320 --> 36:21.199
Ray, I wouldn't call you

36:21.200 --> 36:24.660
if I didn't really need your help.

36:27.100 --> 36:28.719
Will you help me find him?

36:28.720 --> 36:30.309
I'll find him.

36:30.310 --> 36:32.100
Thank y...

36:33.240 --> 36:35.690
Motherfucker.

37:46.460 --> 37:49.050
No, I'm going.

37:49.058 --> 37:52.019
♪ I got to get away ♪

37:52.020 --> 37:54.079

38:04.240 --> 38:06.450

38:09.280 --> 38:11.059

38:11.060 --> 38:13.289
I'm done with that.

38:13.290 --> 38:15.840
Can you please just take me home?

38:15.860 --> 38:18.259
- W-what's goin' on with you?
- I had to deal with this shit

38:18.260 --> 38:20.279
- from Gary, and now you?
- I'm just sayin',

38:20.280 --> 38:22.099
I thought you liked
babysittin' for Molly.

38:22.100 --> 38:24.299
Aren't they expectin' you?

38:24.300 --> 38:27.919
Just please take me home, Ray.

38:27.920 --> 38:30.870
Okay.

38:52.540 --> 38:54.950
It's open.

39:02.966 --> 39:06.110
What the fuck are you doin' here, Ray?

39:08.470 --> 39:10.599
I'm here to help, Daryll.

39:13.140 --> 39:14.979
Sullivan told you where I was?

39:14.980 --> 39:17.420
Yeah.

39:18.600 --> 39:21.019
I swear to Christ, Ray,

39:21.020 --> 39:24.487
if you don't turn and go,
I will fucking kill you.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.740
Why're you doin' this, Daryll?

39:31.760 --> 39:33.621
He killed her.

39:33.622 --> 39:35.869
Who?

39:35.870 --> 39:39.060
My girl.

39:40.840 --> 39:43.169
He fuckin' shot her.

39:43.170 --> 39:44.860
Declan?

39:49.340 --> 39:52.499
Ray, you just better fucking leave.

39:52.500 --> 39:54.659
But you tell Declan
if he wants his shit,

39:54.660 --> 39:56.436
he can come get it.

39:58.840 --> 40:00.479
I know you wanna get even, Daryll,

40:00.480 --> 40:02.300
but this isn't the way to do it.

40:03.818 --> 40:06.279
What happens after you shoot Declan?

40:06.280 --> 40:09.609
Huh? What then?

40:09.610 --> 40:12.760
You just... runnin' for the
rest of your life like Mick?

40:12.770 --> 40:13.954
That what you want?

40:15.410 --> 40:16.879
And why the fuck do you care?

40:16.880 --> 40:19.699
What do you fucking care what I do, Ray?

40:22.720 --> 40:24.464
I'm your brother, Daryll.

40:32.920 --> 40:35.540
Now I'm your brother?

40:39.140 --> 40:41.449
Oh, you motherfucker.

40:41.450 --> 40:43.358
Now I'm your brother?

40:47.660 --> 40:49.560
Now I'm your brother?

40:52.000 --> 40:53.750
Yeah.

40:54.700 --> 40:56.699
No, no, no, no, no, no.

40:56.700 --> 40:58.840
Don't do that. Hey.

40:58.850 --> 40:59.999
Daryll.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.579
Put the gun down. Look at me.

41:03.580 --> 41:05.420
Look at... Daryll.

41:06.960 --> 41:08.980

41:12.095 --> 41:14.555
You know that.

41:14.556 --> 41:18.359
Gimme the gun.

41:18.360 --> 41:20.160

41:20.170 --> 41:21.930

41:21.938 --> 41:25.179
- Come on, D, gimme the gun.

41:48.740 --> 41:51.939

41:51.940 --> 41:54.300

41:56.340 --> 41:57.680
Ray.

42:02.180 --> 42:04.680
You kill that motherfucker.

42:30.670 --> 42:32.599
Yeah?

42:32.600 --> 42:34.329
I need you to do me a favor.

42:34.330 --> 42:35.379
What's up?

42:35.380 --> 42:38.014
Head over to the Lightning
Motel in Queens.

42:38.015 --> 42:40.266
What for?

42:41.640 --> 42:43.561
I need you to pick up Daryll.

42:45.060 --> 42:46.599
Everything all right?

42:46.600 --> 42:49.760
Yeah. I'll call ya later.

43:00.370 --> 43:02.029
Ah...

43:02.030 --> 43:03.619
What's that?

43:03.620 --> 43:05.119
Champagne.

43:05.120 --> 43:08.709
- What for?
- For fuckin' hope, for dreams!

43:08.710 --> 43:10.839
Let ya in on a secret...

43:10.840 --> 43:12.629
all champagne is the same.

43:12.630 --> 43:15.979
Don't matter if ya pay $14

43:15.980 --> 43:17.919
or 114.

43:19.280 --> 43:23.100
After one glass a the...
the fuckin' bubbles,

43:23.101 --> 43:24.643
it all tastes the same.

43:24.644 --> 43:26.890
Because it is the fuckin' same.

43:26.896 --> 43:28.839
You don't have to wait for good news.

43:28.840 --> 43:30.524
You just gotta celebrate.

43:36.970 --> 43:40.030
Oh! See, this could be good news.

43:41.800 --> 43:45.660
Uh, good evening. Is this Frankie Lee?

43:45.665 --> 43:47.940
How much?

43:49.760 --> 43:51.539
Holy sh-shit!

43:51.540 --> 43:54.500
Frankie, you're a genius!

43:55.920 --> 43:58.019
Good thing we get the bank account.

43:58.020 --> 44:00.419
Now all we need is to find Daryll

44:00.420 --> 44:02.182
and get the paper, huh?

44:03.766 --> 44:05.559
To the best of my knowledge

44:05.560 --> 44:07.479
the mayor started working
with Officer McGrath

44:07.480 --> 44:08.813
about two years ago.

44:08.814 --> 44:11.440
Be specific, please.

44:14.800 --> 44:18.539
Mayor Feratti conspired
with Officer Sean McGrath

44:18.540 --> 44:22.410
to take kickbacks and payoffs.

45:36.150 --> 45:37.760
Uhh...

46:57.540 --> 46:58.730
Yeah.

46:58.733 --> 47:00.519
He's gone.

47:00.520 --> 47:02.779
Scholl?

47:02.780 --> 47:06.499
Fareed is dead. Scholl ran off.

47:06.500 --> 47:08.569
Somebody knows we're here.

47:08.570 --> 47:11.519
We don't get him, all I got is you.

47:11.520 --> 47:13.270
I'm close.
