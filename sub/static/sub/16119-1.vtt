We ain't even--

00:06.274 --> 00:08.342
Hey, man!
- Hey, Alfred!

00:08.376 --> 00:10.544
- Hey, man, I'm gonna need some
cash for this mirror, man.

00:10.578 --> 00:11.545
- Alfred!

00:11.579 --> 00:12.546
- Hey, hello?
Hello?

00:12.580 --> 00:13.914
- Hey, hey, hey!

00:13.947 --> 00:15.416
- Man, I know you hear me
talking to you, man,

00:15.449 --> 00:16.850
I'm speaking English.
- All right, cool.

00:16.884 --> 00:18.419
Let's just keep it
cool, okay, guys?

00:18.452 --> 00:19.587
- Nigga, if you don't
get out of my face....

00:19.620 --> 00:21.155
- Worldstar!

00:21.189 --> 00:22.523
- No, don't do that to us.
- No, no, no, no no.

00:22.556 --> 00:23.657
I think I'm being
more than fair,

00:23.691 --> 00:24.492
calmly asking for
compensation.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.859
So let's go, bro.

00:25.893 --> 00:27.528
- No, y'all staying
broke tonight.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.263
- Well, you trying to get
in the club before 10:45,

00:29.297 --> 00:30.998
which means you trying
to get in before 11:00,

00:31.031 --> 00:33.201
which means you also broke.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.535
Nobody's stunting
on anybody here.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.337
- Ain't no one stunting
on anyone here.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.505
- Bitch, will you please
shut the hell up?

00:37.538 --> 00:38.772
- Don't talk to me like that!

00:38.806 --> 00:40.208
- I'll talk to whoever
however I want,

00:40.241 --> 00:41.742
if you got a problem with it,
we can settle it,

00:41.775 --> 00:43.611
but my car was not
involved, man.

00:43.644 --> 00:46.614
- Hold on, hold on, man, I'm
getting crazy déjà vu right now.

00:46.647 --> 00:49.917
Okay, where's the dog
with the Texas on him?

00:51.051 --> 00:52.686
Oh, there he is.

00:52.720 --> 00:53.987
That's a trip, man.

00:56.090 --> 00:57.225
- Yo, what's your man on?

00:57.258 --> 00:59.293
- Yo, worry about
this mirror, man.

00:59.327 --> 01:00.694
- Just get another mirror.
You Paper Boy.

01:00.728 --> 01:04.298
You rich, right?
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:04.332 --> 01:06.867
You Paper Boy?
- You know it.

01:06.900 --> 01:10.104
- Boy, you so
garbage,
that postal mixtape was garbage.

01:10.138 --> 01:12.640
What it was?
Uh, "Mucking."

01:12.673 --> 01:14.442
Mucking--what the hell
is mucking, Paper Boy?

01:14.475 --> 01:16.544
- Man, you know what it is, I
explained in the hood, nigger.

01:16.577 --> 01:17.911
Why we even talking, man?
Why--

01:17.945 --> 01:19.480
Shit, what's going on?
What's good?

01:19.513 --> 01:20.948
- This is definitely
going on Worldstar.

01:20.981 --> 01:22.450
- No it is not!
Stop it.

01:22.483 --> 01:24.385
Nigga, what are you doing?

01:24.418 --> 01:25.719
- Nigga, what are you doing?

01:25.753 --> 01:28.256
- Okay, well, what's up?
Hmm? Yeah.

01:28.289 --> 01:30.558
I got my people waiting
right over there.

01:30.591 --> 01:33.394
Watch out, baby.
What's up?

01:33.427 --> 01:36.330
Let's go!
What's up?

01:41.669 --> 01:42.803
- Wait.

01:42.836 --> 01:45.139
- This is so weird, man.

- Oh, my God.

02:38.392 --> 02:41.995
Why are you up?

02:42.029 --> 02:45.065
- I had a weird dream.

02:45.098 --> 02:47.134
I was swimming in this pool,
but it was like the ocean

02:47.167 --> 02:49.737
and I was swimming with the
seaweed, but it wasn't seaweed,

02:49.770 --> 02:53.474
it was, like, hands.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.476
And I was swimming
with this girl.

02:55.509 --> 02:58.145
And she was saying
if the hands grab you,

02:58.178 --> 03:01.048
they pull you down and drown
you, so swim above them.

03:01.081 --> 03:03.417
- Hmm. That's deep.
- I know.

03:03.451 --> 03:05.553
I think it's about society,
'cause, like--

03:05.586 --> 03:07.855
- Who's the girl?

03:07.888 --> 03:09.823
- I don't know.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.759
- What she look like?

03:11.792 --> 03:13.994
- She was fat.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.363
And not interesting.

03:15.396 --> 03:17.164
- Okay.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.332
- You jealous?

03:18.366 --> 03:20.167
- I'm disappointed
in your story,

03:20.200 --> 03:23.604
'cause you're first saying that
she's fat and annoying,

03:23.637 --> 03:26.173
and then you all of a sudden
turn around

03:26.206 --> 03:27.841
and you're making out
with this bitch.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.677
- I never said
we were making out.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.011
- Were you making out?
- Yeah.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.346
Yeah, we were.
- [laughs]

03:32.380 --> 03:34.248
Oh, man.

03:34.282 --> 03:35.583
I know you.
- No, you don't know me.

03:35.616 --> 03:38.185
- Mmm--oh, no.
- What?

03:38.218 --> 03:40.354
- My breath.
- [sniffs]

03:40.388 --> 03:41.855
Oh, I love it.
What is that?

03:41.889 --> 03:43.391
Curry?

03:43.424 --> 03:45.393
Are you kidding me?
- Like a very deep curry?

03:45.426 --> 03:47.361
That is not--that's, like,
some freaky shit.

03:47.395 --> 03:49.630
[giggles]
- Ooh, I like that.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.865
- What are you--
- I love that.

03:51.899 --> 03:55.636
- You're so stupid.

03:55.669 --> 03:58.606
[giggles]
- I don't care.

04:07.681 --> 04:08.649
- Mm.

04:11.819 --> 04:14.755
Tell me you love me.
- [laughs]

04:17.358 --> 04:19.593
- Why did you just laugh?

04:19.627 --> 04:21.295
- 'Cause you always say that,
and I'm always,

04:21.329 --> 04:24.565
like, "of course."

04:24.598 --> 04:27.234
- Then why don't you
just say "I love you"?

04:27.267 --> 04:28.369
- I love you.

04:31.305 --> 04:32.473
- [scoffs]

04:46.620 --> 04:47.955
Uh-oh.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.423
She's awake.

04:49.457 --> 04:51.692
She's gonna kill us all
with her cuteness.

04:51.725 --> 04:54.628
- You remember you have
Lottie tonight, right?

04:54.662 --> 04:56.129
- Hey, there.

04:56.163 --> 04:57.931
Of course I did.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.333
[mouthing] I did not.

04:59.367 --> 05:01.369
- 'Cause I have
parent teacher conferences.

05:01.402 --> 05:03.303
Also, I don't always want
her at your parents' house.

05:03.337 --> 05:04.838
She lives here.

05:04.872 --> 05:07.040
- I promise she won't be
at my parents' house.

05:07.074 --> 05:09.142
I'll pick her up after work.

05:09.176 --> 05:10.711
- And if you're gonna
be staying here,

05:10.744 --> 05:13.881
I'm gonna need
your help with rent.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.282
- I'll get it to you tonight.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.451
What time are you coming back?

05:17.485 --> 05:20.721
- I don't know,
probably like 11:00?

05:20.754 --> 05:23.824
- 11:00?
11:00's a little late.

05:23.857 --> 05:27.160
You, uh, taking the parents
to Magic City's? Follies?

05:27.194 --> 05:29.129
You know, Cheetahs is actually
a better spot for that.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.931
- I have a date.

05:34.602 --> 05:36.804
You're with Daddy tonight.

05:36.837 --> 05:40.808
Mommy's going on a date
with some corny dude.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.876
Yeah, some corny dude.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.211
What?

05:44.244 --> 05:46.580
No, this is a great
environment for you.

05:46.614 --> 05:48.148
- Thank you very much.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.818
You have a nice flight, now.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.486
- Excuse me, sir--
- Fuck off.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.154
- I know, right?

05:54.187 --> 05:55.689
- That was just rude, man.

05:55.723 --> 05:57.858
Hey, yo, Compound was lit
last night.

05:57.891 --> 06:00.561
Man, my cousin had, like eight
bottles up in that bitch.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.730
They fought with, like,
three ho's a piece, my nig.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.565
Shit was crazy.

06:04.598 --> 06:08.168
Hey, we gonna hit $2 Tuesday at
the Ultimate, you want to roll?

06:08.201 --> 06:11.872
Earn.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.674
Hey, yo, Earn.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.275

06:15.308 --> 06:16.276
Gotti.

06:16.309 --> 06:18.011
[laughs]

06:18.045 --> 06:22.416
How you look when
you high at work.

06:22.450 --> 06:24.885
- Van's dating
other people.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.454
She's gonna kick me
out the house.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.055
I'm also broke
and I can't sign anyone up

06:28.088 --> 06:30.190
'cause I'm not an old lady.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.792
- Can I go to
the Caribbean on this?

06:31.825 --> 06:33.193
- Well, of course
you can, honey.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.928
I'll even give you
an extra flight.

06:34.962 --> 06:38.231
As long as you keep
flirting with me.

06:38.265 --> 06:41.168
- Oh, okay.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.446
- This bitch is amazing.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.781
- That's really rough.

06:53.814 --> 06:54.948
- I don't know,
I would watch.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.550
- That's more rough.

06:56.584 --> 06:58.586
- Hey, yo, you heard that new
Paper Boy mixtape, man?

06:58.619 --> 07:00.087
I heard it's coming out
this Friday, man.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.489
His last one was hot.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.591
- I haven't really been
keeping up, man.

07:03.624 --> 07:04.925
I don't know who that is.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.994
- Man, get out your
little cave, little boy.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.562
Hey, look, check it out,
here go the video right here.

07:08.596 --> 07:09.797

07:10.931 --> 07:11.999
* Make her strip

07:12.032 --> 07:13.734

07:13.767 --> 07:14.968
* Catch me in the paper man

07:15.002 --> 07:17.237

07:17.270 --> 07:19.507
- Hey, yo,

07:19.540 --> 07:20.574
- That's my cousin.

07:20.608 --> 07:23.911
- Damn,
she is thick as fuck.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.312
Is that weird for you?

07:25.345 --> 07:27.414
- No, Paper Boy.
Paper Boy is my cousin.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.849
- That's your cousin, man,
you gonna want to get in there

07:28.882 --> 07:31.752
before he gets signed, man.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.922
Offering that boy
seven M's on the table.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.289
- Is that a real offer?

07:36.323 --> 07:39.493
- That's a real offer,
them real M's.

07:39.527 --> 07:41.028
- All right, man,
I'll catch you later.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.329
- Where you going?
You going to talk to him?

07:42.362 --> 07:43.931
Hey, tell him I said
"what up."

07:43.964 --> 07:47.000
Is that really your cousin in
the video with the big tits?

07:47.034 --> 07:48.201
You don't know Paper Boy.
[laughs]

08:01.314 --> 08:02.850
- Son.

08:02.883 --> 08:05.218
- Hey, Dad.
Where's Mom?

08:05.252 --> 08:08.188
- Hey, Earn.
- Hey, Mom.

08:09.523 --> 08:12.993
How are you?
- Good.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.628
How're you?

08:14.662 --> 08:17.364
- I'm good.
- Good.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.734
You gonna invite me in?

08:20.768 --> 08:22.570
- [chuckles] No.
- Why not?

08:22.603 --> 08:23.804
I can't afford it.

08:23.837 --> 08:24.705
- Come on,
you really think

08:24.738 --> 08:26.173
I'm here for money?

08:26.206 --> 08:28.241
- We do, yes.

08:28.275 --> 08:29.076
I'm looking for Alfred.

08:29.109 --> 08:29.910
Also, could you pick up

08:29.943 --> 08:30.844
Lottie from Kaya's?

08:30.878 --> 08:31.845
I'm getting a job

08:31.879 --> 08:32.880
and Van's on a date.

08:32.913 --> 08:33.714
- You got a job?

08:33.747 --> 08:34.682
- Hey, good for her.

08:34.715 --> 08:35.583
- Yes, I got a job.

08:35.616 --> 08:36.750
And thanks, Mom.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.251
I'm your son, Earn.

08:38.285 --> 08:39.853
I used to live in there
with you, remember?

08:39.887 --> 08:41.421
- Used to?
There was a turd

08:41.454 --> 08:42.756
the size of
my arm waiting for me

08:42.790 --> 08:44.424
when I got home yesterday.

08:44.457 --> 08:47.494
You supposed to be so smart,
you can't remember to flush?

08:47.527 --> 08:50.397
