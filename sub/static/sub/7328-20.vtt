WEBVTT

00:02.803 --> 00:06.174
You have entered the circle.

00:06.207 --> 00:09.043
You have felt the flames.

00:09.077 --> 00:12.313
You have suffered
the seven trials.

00:12.346 --> 00:16.150
You have reached the moment
of your final test.

00:16.184 --> 00:18.152
Are you prepared?

00:18.186 --> 00:19.220
PLEDGES:
Yes, sir.

00:19.253 --> 00:22.156
Then let's do it.

00:22.190 --> 00:24.192
Go!

00:24.225 --> 00:25.493
( pledges yelling )

00:25.526 --> 00:26.727
Last one to the house

00:26.760 --> 00:28.296
drinks the keg
dregs!

00:28.329 --> 00:29.830
( pledges yelling )

00:29.863 --> 00:31.499
I love Hell Week.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.634
Did you see their faces?

00:37.771 --> 00:39.207
( grunting )

00:48.516 --> 00:50.818
( screaming )

00:55.223 --> 00:59.193
Captioning sponsored by
PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

00:59.227 --> 01:03.231
and CBS

01:35.196 --> 01:36.464
MAN:
Strike Force Command,

01:36.497 --> 01:37.465
this is Red Leader.

01:37.498 --> 01:38.832
Alpha Team is in play.

01:38.866 --> 01:40.634
Roger that, Red Leader,
I have visual.

01:40.668 --> 01:42.170
You've got hostiles on both

01:42.203 --> 01:44.372
the north and east quadrants
of the building.

01:44.405 --> 01:45.339
RED LEADER:
Hostile on the left flank.

01:45.373 --> 01:46.640
All teams prepare
for entry.

01:46.674 --> 01:48.342
Our target is located
on the...

01:48.376 --> 01:49.610
( doorbell ringing )

01:49.643 --> 01:50.878
RED LEADER:
Say again, Strike Force Command.

01:50.911 --> 01:51.912
Did not copy your last.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.382
Uh, wait one, Red Leader.

01:54.415 --> 01:56.450
Copy that.
Red Unit, hold your positions.

01:57.585 --> 02:00.388
Hi, Probie!

02:00.421 --> 02:02.723
Uh, David, I have
to call you back.

02:02.756 --> 02:03.791
Copy that, McGee.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.726
I told you he was a boxers guy.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.595
Damn, McGee, I thought
for sure

02:07.628 --> 02:08.729
you were
a tighty-whitey man.

02:09.597 --> 02:11.565
Come on,
let's get dressed.

02:11.599 --> 02:13.167
You don't want to keep Gibbs
waiting.

02:13.201 --> 02:13.867
McGEE:
You said 0900.

02:13.901 --> 02:15.336
It's only 7:30!

02:15.369 --> 02:16.504
KATE:
We thought
we'd observe you

02:16.537 --> 02:18.572
in your
natural environment.

02:18.606 --> 02:19.740
TONY:
Kind of like watching
National Geographic.

02:20.608 --> 02:21.742
We watch as the McGee

02:21.775 --> 02:23.577
moves slowly
from the watering hole

02:23.611 --> 02:25.279
trailed by hyenas.
( chuckling )

02:27.615 --> 02:29.483
Is this the History
Channel Room?

02:30.751 --> 02:32.620
Ah...

02:32.653 --> 02:34.455
this is where you do
your writing thing, huh?

02:38.259 --> 02:41.262
( typing, quacking )

02:46.400 --> 02:47.668
Look at this.

02:47.701 --> 02:48.802
"The Continuing Adventures

02:48.836 --> 02:50.438
of L.J. Tibbs."

02:50.471 --> 02:51.439
That's personal!

02:51.472 --> 02:52.540
Hmm...

02:52.573 --> 02:53.474
I wonder who

02:53.507 --> 02:56.644
"L.J. Tibbs" could be?

02:56.677 --> 02:58.279
Check it out.

02:58.312 --> 02:58.979
He eats dinosaur cereal.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.349
( Tony screeching )

03:03.917 --> 03:05.419
McGEE:
Okay, would you
both please

03:05.453 --> 03:06.587
just wait by the door?

03:06.620 --> 03:07.921
By the door, please?

03:07.955 --> 03:09.657
TONY:
Got any Macy Gray
in here?

03:09.690 --> 03:10.791
Wait, Tony,
don't touch those.

03:10.824 --> 03:11.859
Those are collectibles.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.361
They're very valuable.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.897
Oh, my gosh. Sorry.

03:16.930 --> 03:19.467
I just thought
they were musty old records.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.735
It's bad enough

03:21.769 --> 03:22.703
having to work on Sundays,

03:22.736 --> 03:25.005
without you guys ransacking
my apartment.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.408
Yes, it was very
inconsiderate of
that Marine sergeant

03:27.441 --> 03:28.809
to die on a weekend.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.644
I'm getting my weapon.
Don't touch anything else!

03:31.679 --> 03:33.747
KATE:
Hey!

03:33.781 --> 03:36.216
George Clooney could not
get laid in this place.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.757
Your place needs
a lot of help, McGee.

03:43.791 --> 03:45.793
At least you're not building
a boat in your basement.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.595
Come on.

03:59.773 --> 04:00.808
Tim?

04:00.841 --> 04:01.809
RED LEADER:
Strike Force Command,

04:01.842 --> 04:03.043
this is Red Leader.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.645
McGee, are you there?

04:09.750 --> 04:10.884
This is Strike Force Command.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.420
Do you copy?

04:12.820 --> 04:14.021
Based on the rigor

04:14.054 --> 04:15.923
resolving itself,

04:15.956 --> 04:18.726
I'd say our Sergeant's been dead
for at least 36 hours.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.662
I'm more concerned
with how it happened, Duck.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.565
Well, apart from the obvious,

04:24.598 --> 04:25.833
he took a tumble
down the hill.

04:25.866 --> 04:26.967
Neck's probably broken.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.869
Yeah, but then, we never do

04:28.902 --> 04:31.305
put too much emphasis
on the obvious.

04:31.339 --> 04:33.774
Do we, Sergeant?

04:33.807 --> 04:34.875
Ow!

04:36.009 --> 04:37.778
It's remarkable

04:37.811 --> 04:39.547
how these college hangouts

04:39.580 --> 04:41.449
all smell the same.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.884
Stale beer, tobacco...

04:43.917 --> 04:44.718
vomit.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.887
It's from the kid
that found him.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.389
Any idea

04:48.422 --> 04:49.923
why the young man
is half-naked?

04:49.957 --> 04:52.860
It must be
a college thing.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.728
Hey...

04:54.762 --> 04:55.729
where you been?

04:55.763 --> 04:57.798
Stopped for coffee.
Got... you are welcome.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.467
Marine Sergeant
Joseph Aaron Turner.

04:59.500 --> 05:02.903
Found dead at 0200
by a drunk college student.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.538
Sounds like Hell Week.

05:04.572 --> 05:05.806
Hell Week?

05:05.839 --> 05:07.841
Yeah, fraternal
rite of passage.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.343
Worst week of my life.

05:09.377 --> 05:10.844
Followed by the best four years.

05:10.878 --> 05:13.981
Yeah? You were running around
inyour skivvies, DiNozzo?

05:16.016 --> 05:17.084
Technically.

05:17.117 --> 05:20.754
But back then, they made us
wear them on our heads.

05:20.788 --> 05:24.091
I think it was a... sort of
a character-building thing.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.626
Certainly explains
a lot.

05:25.659 --> 05:26.560
GIBBS:
Uh-huh.

05:26.594 --> 05:27.828
Hey, McGee...

05:27.861 --> 05:28.696
McGEE:
Yeah.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.864
Find out what Turner
was doing on campus.

05:30.898 --> 05:33.066
On it.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.002
Excuse me,
Special Agent Gibbs?

05:35.035 --> 05:36.370
I wonder if we could
let Mr. Pippin

05:36.404 --> 05:38.539
go home and dress
more appropriately?

05:38.572 --> 05:40.007
GIBBS:
Sure.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.008
After one of my agents
interviews him.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.910
DiNozzo.

05:42.943 --> 05:46.013
Um, you know, I think that's
really more up Kate's alley.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.448
GIBBS:
Well, maybe,

05:47.481 --> 05:48.749
but you two
have so much in common.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.552
Go.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.888
This area popular

05:54.922 --> 05:56.557
with students?

05:56.590 --> 05:57.858
SHERIFF:
For all sorts of
extracurricular activities.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.159
Bonfires,

05:59.192 --> 06:00.594
fraternity pranks....

06:00.628 --> 06:01.929
KATE:
Hazing?

06:01.962 --> 06:03.597
We've had our share
of incidents.

06:03.631 --> 06:04.698
Broken bones,

06:04.732 --> 06:07.501
alcohol poisoning.

06:07.535 --> 06:08.969
And this isn't the first
accidental death

06:09.002 --> 06:10.738
we've seen.

06:10.771 --> 06:12.506
Who said anything
about an accident?

06:12.540 --> 06:16.176
You think this
is a homicide?

06:16.209 --> 06:19.613
Until I find out
it wasn't.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.849
McGEE:
Boss, I had Turner's SRB pulled.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.017
He's an NROTC student attached

06:24.051 --> 06:25.919
to the Waverly University
campus.

06:25.953 --> 06:26.920
Lives in the dorms.

06:26.954 --> 06:28.055
Get an address?

06:28.088 --> 06:29.156
Uh, just getting on that.

06:29.189 --> 06:30.691
I'm going to radio his unit.

06:38.699 --> 06:39.767
GIBBS:
I thought college students

06:39.800 --> 06:40.734
were supposed to be poor.

06:40.768 --> 06:43.036
Most of my midshipmen
would not have survived

06:43.070 --> 06:46.073
without at least 200 channels
and a DSL hook-up, Agent Gibbs.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.508
GIBBS:
How long have you been
Turner's

06:47.541 --> 06:48.742
Marine Officer Instructor,

06:48.776 --> 06:49.643
Captain Lemay?

06:49.677 --> 06:51.011
LEMAY:
Since he enrolled
last year.

06:51.044 --> 06:54.081
You expect to lose men
in combat,

06:54.114 --> 06:56.216
not on the
college campus.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.485
What the hell happened
to my Marine?

06:57.518 --> 06:58.952
Working on it, Captain.

06:58.986 --> 07:00.521
What can I do to help?

07:00.554 --> 07:02.122
You can start by telling us
about him.

07:02.155 --> 07:04.658
He was one of my best
midshipmen.

07:04.692 --> 07:07.094
Came to us straight
from the fleet

07:07.127 --> 07:08.862
after two combat tours
in Iraq

07:08.896 --> 07:10.030
and Afghanistan.
How is he taking

07:10.063 --> 07:11.965
to college life?
There's a fair amount
of culture shock,

07:11.999 --> 07:14.101
but like any good Marine,
he adapted.

07:14.134 --> 07:16.236
Any personal problems or issues?

07:16.269 --> 07:18.906
We had a few incidents with
student activists on campus.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.474
Protesting the war?

07:20.508 --> 07:21.709
Protesting
anything military.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.611
Our unit was vandalized,

07:23.644 --> 07:25.613
rallies outside our offices.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.615
When word got out that
Turner was a vet, he
took some heat.

07:27.648 --> 07:28.882
GIBBS:
What kind of heat?

07:28.916 --> 07:30.951
Name-calling, mostly.

07:30.984 --> 07:31.985
Turner handled it

07:32.019 --> 07:33.186
like most Marines.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.688
Not well.

07:34.722 --> 07:36.590
He lost five Marines
in his squad in Iraq.

07:36.624 --> 07:38.025
He handled it as
best he could,

07:38.058 --> 07:40.628
Agent Gibbs.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.496
He was a damn fine Marine.

07:42.530 --> 07:44.532
McGEE:
And intelligent,
too, boss.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.100
This is graduate-level
mathematics.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.169
Theoretical calculus.

07:49.202 --> 07:51.171
LEMAY:
He was on the advanced track
in math and physics.

07:51.204 --> 07:54.074
He was a real asset
to the Corps.

07:59.079 --> 08:02.249
You're blowing in my ear,
Mr. Palmer.

08:02.282 --> 08:03.250
Oh, sorry, Doctor.

08:03.283 --> 08:06.086
Something piqued
your interest?

08:06.119 --> 08:07.287
It seems this break
is too clean

08:07.320 --> 08:08.889
to be the result
of a fall.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.891
Correct. If he landed
on his neck,

08:10.924 --> 08:13.661
this would be jagged here.

08:13.694 --> 08:16.530
But this?
This is too precise.

08:16.564 --> 08:19.166
You notice
anything else?

08:19.199 --> 08:20.868
Uh, he took a beating.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.069
Yes, bruises
round the eyes,

08:22.102 --> 08:24.071
knuckles grazed--
but what captured

08:24.104 --> 08:26.940
my attention most were these.

08:26.974 --> 08:28.742
This coloration suggests
they were recent--

08:28.776 --> 08:30.277
inflicted on our

08:30.310 --> 08:32.045
poor Marine just
before his death.

08:32.079 --> 08:33.747
Do we know
what caused them?

08:33.781 --> 08:35.182
We do not... yet.

08:35.215 --> 08:38.085
This reminds me
of an English earl

08:38.118 --> 08:40.921
who was abducted
and asphyxiated.

08:40.954 --> 08:42.756
Every bone in his body
was broken.

08:42.790 --> 08:44.057
What happened to him?

08:44.091 --> 08:45.993
Well, it was on
a moonlit night...

08:46.026 --> 08:46.960
We know what
killed him yet?

08:46.994 --> 08:50.698
Sergeant Turner was involved
in a nasty fight

08:50.731 --> 08:52.299
that resulted in a broken neck.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.234
He was murdered.
Yeah.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.803
What about these welts?

08:55.836 --> 08:57.605
Well, certainly painful,

08:57.638 --> 09:00.340
but they didn't do
any internal damage.

09:00.373 --> 09:01.141
Mostly surface.

09:01.174 --> 09:02.843
You thinking what
I'm thinking, Doc?

09:02.876 --> 09:04.878
I'm afraid so, Jethro.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.947
Call me when you find out.

09:10.117 --> 09:11.885
Find out what,
Doctor?

09:11.919 --> 09:13.220
Sergeant Turner...

09:13.253 --> 09:14.354
may have been tortured

09:14.387 --> 09:16.957
before his death.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.726
Whoa!
Yeah.

09:18.759 --> 09:21.161
So that's what happened
to the English earl.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.765
What English earl?

09:26.767 --> 09:28.335
ABBY:
You said Turner
was smart, McGee,

09:28.368 --> 09:30.671
when, in fact, you should've
said he was brilliant.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.773
These equations rock.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.307
It's Homology.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.009
Mm, close.
Cohomology.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.645
I think it's Homology.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.346
No, it's
cohomology.

09:39.379 --> 09:41.615
I did my independent study
in advanced string theory;

09:41.649 --> 09:42.883
so I think
I would know.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.785
I see you're playing
the MIT card again.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.353
No, I just happened
to go to school there.

09:46.386 --> 09:47.821
And you just happen
to talk about it...

09:47.855 --> 09:48.856
a lot.

09:50.390 --> 09:51.892
GIBBS:
Oh, so glad
to see you two

09:51.925 --> 09:53.761
don't need
adult supervision.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.195
McGee was annoying me again.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.230
Don't.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.800
What do we have
from the crime scene?

09:59.833 --> 10:02.135
Oh, um... I got Turner's
toxicology report back.

10:02.169 --> 10:05.405
His blood alcohol level
was .07-- not drunk.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.940
Not sober, either.
What else?

10:06.974 --> 10:08.909
There were foreign
blood samples

10:08.942 --> 10:11.411
found on his face
and his knuckles...

10:11.444 --> 10:12.545
Yeah, and?

10:12.579 --> 10:15.048
And a Chinese menu
of chemicals found
on his skin.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.150
Mixed dried paint,
turpentine, bleach--

10:17.184 --> 10:19.953
it's like he was partying
in a janitor's closet.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.021
What about
Turner's laptop?

10:21.054 --> 10:23.023
Well, I completely
underestimated

10:23.056 --> 10:24.892
the depth of his
mathematics ability.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.193
I thought that he
was concentrating on

10:26.226 --> 10:27.427
numerical analysis,
but it turns out

10:27.460 --> 10:29.329
he was also working on
fiber bundles.

10:29.362 --> 10:31.398
I mean, the work's
a little rough...

10:31.431 --> 10:33.000
Anything connected
to his death, McGee?

10:33.033 --> 10:33.934
Not yet.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.169
Um, I didn't go to MIT,

10:36.203 --> 10:38.271
but I think
I found something.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.842
Turner had a private container.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.877
It's like a vault inside
the hard drive where

10:43.911 --> 10:45.278
he can hide files--
very sophisticated.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.346
GIBBS:
Can you open it?

10:46.379 --> 10:47.180
They don't call me

10:47.214 --> 10:48.916
"Five Fingers Sciuto"
for nothing.

10:48.949 --> 10:49.750
Actually, nobody
calls me that.

10:49.783 --> 10:50.918
My nickname was
actually Vamperstein,

10:50.951 --> 10:52.419
but I never really liked

10:52.452 --> 10:53.921
the sound of it.
Ah, Abby...

10:53.954 --> 10:55.422
Right.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.891
Too much caffeine.
Sorry.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.326
It'll take
just a second...

10:59.359 --> 11:00.360
( beeping )

11:00.393 --> 11:02.896
And... we... are...

11:02.930 --> 11:04.164
( beep )

11:04.197 --> 11:05.833
...in.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.001
It's an encrypted
e-mail.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.703
He received it
on Friday.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.105
GIBBS:
Same day he was killed.

11:22.482 --> 11:24.084
MEN ( chanting ):
One, two, three!

11:24.117 --> 11:25.352
LEADER:
That's it!

11:25.385 --> 11:26.754
( all grunting loudly )

11:26.787 --> 11:27.955
MEN:
One, two, three!

11:27.988 --> 11:31.024
SERGEANT:
Maybe I should give you
a break, you know...

11:31.058 --> 11:32.192
because you're college girls.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.861
What do you think,
Simmons?

11:33.894 --> 11:34.995
No, Gunnery Sergeant?

11:35.028 --> 11:35.695
Damn straight!

11:35.729 --> 11:37.965
To me, you're
midshipmen!

11:37.998 --> 11:39.199
Barely! Understood?

11:39.232 --> 11:40.400
WOMEN:
Yes, Gunnery Sergeant!

11:40.433 --> 11:43.203
SERGEANT:
You pull a stunt like
that again with me,

11:43.236 --> 11:45.305
and you can both kiss
your scholarships goodbye!

11:45.338 --> 11:46.807
Go!

11:46.840 --> 11:49.476
Away!

11:49.509 --> 11:51.044
GIBBS:
Gunnery Sergeant Leeka.

11:52.045 --> 11:55.048
Special Agents Gibbs
and Todd-- NCIS.

11:55.082 --> 11:56.984
Sorry you had to
hear all that.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.418
What'd they do?

11:58.451 --> 12:00.120
Notice the
hair, ma'am?

12:00.153 --> 12:02.756
Oh... Not regulation?

12:02.790 --> 12:04.424
No.

12:04.457 --> 12:07.027
Purple and orange?
Oh.

12:07.060 --> 12:10.063
Sometimes I feel like
I'm a kindergarten teacher.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.032
Oh, yeah... I'm familiar
with the sentiment.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.000
( Leeka chuckles )

12:13.033 --> 12:15.102
So, Captain Lemay said
you wanted to talk to me

12:15.135 --> 12:17.070
about Sergeant Turner.

12:17.104 --> 12:19.072
What kind of midshipman
was he, Gunny?

12:19.106 --> 12:21.374
He put most of those
kids to shame, sir.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.343
Would've made one hell
of a Marine officer.

12:23.376 --> 12:26.013
Your captain said that
he had problems with
war protesters?

12:26.046 --> 12:28.015
LEEKA:
Eh, you could say that, ma'am.

12:28.048 --> 12:30.017
One of them
spit on his uniform.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.985
Turner cleaned his clock.

12:32.019 --> 12:35.022
Well, do you think this
protester was the type
to look for revenge?

12:35.055 --> 12:38.058
You saying Turner
was murdered?

12:38.091 --> 12:39.059
KATE:
We are.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.493
I want to know why.

12:40.527 --> 12:41.528
Simmons!

12:41.561 --> 12:43.096
Sir!

12:43.130 --> 12:44.197
Get me Midshipman Blake!
Double-time!

12:44.231 --> 12:46.166
Yes, Gunny!
Blake's a
Petty Officer.

12:46.199 --> 12:48.836
He was tight with Turner;
he's also the one that

12:48.869 --> 12:51.104
pulled him off the protester
before the campus cops arrived.

12:51.138 --> 12:52.339
Who else was Turner
tight with?

12:52.372 --> 12:53.807
Blake'll know.

12:53.841 --> 12:55.342
They're the only two
enlisted men in the unit.

12:55.375 --> 12:56.977
Excuse me,
Gunnery Sergeant.

12:57.010 --> 12:57.945
What, Simmons?!

12:57.978 --> 12:59.246
Midshipman Blake
didn't report

12:59.279 --> 13:00.848
to formation this morning.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.282
Blake's never been UA--

13:02.315 --> 13:04.084
not since I
started here.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.053
You telling me Petty Officer
Blake is missing?

13:06.086 --> 13:08.989
No, I'm telling you
that he is, Agent Gibbs.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.825
No one's seen Blake
since Friday night.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.064
Oh, hi, ladies.

13:17.097 --> 13:19.599
( whispers ):
Oh, God, I miss college.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.101
Find the room yet, probie?

13:21.134 --> 13:22.202
Right here.
Yeah. Blake's not there.

13:24.071 --> 13:26.506
You never told me
you had a brother.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.475
Any idea
when he's coming back?

13:28.508 --> 13:30.110
I haven't seen him
for a couple days.

13:40.187 --> 13:43.056
You guys are definitely
not campus cops.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.057
I make you for FBI.

13:44.091 --> 13:45.859
Wrong. NCIS.

13:45.893 --> 13:46.894
That stands for...

13:46.927 --> 13:48.095
Yeah, I know what
it stands for.

13:48.128 --> 13:50.130
You're here
'cause of Turner, right?

13:50.163 --> 13:51.364
Did you know him?

13:51.398 --> 13:53.166
I was in his NROTC unit.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.103
McGEE:
Oh, wow! These are the new
docking stations for the...

13:56.136 --> 13:57.971
Yeah, yeah.
He just got that.

13:58.005 --> 13:59.339
For the new Axxum X-5
handheld computer.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.041
It's sweet, right?

14:01.074 --> 14:02.943
( mocking ):
Sweet!

14:04.177 --> 14:06.079
Shouldn't you guys be
wearing rubber gloves?

14:06.113 --> 14:07.214
You're completely compromising

14:07.247 --> 14:08.481
the integrity
of the crime scene.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.251
It's not a crime scene.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.220
It's a dorm room.

14:13.253 --> 14:14.487
You totally
think Finnegan

14:14.521 --> 14:16.356
had something to do
with Turner's death.

14:16.389 --> 14:17.357
Why else would you be here?

14:17.390 --> 14:18.591
( laughing ):
You got us, Sherlock.

14:18.625 --> 14:22.029
Maybe they were partners in
some kind of illicit business--

14:22.062 --> 14:23.430
like, they dealt
drugs on campus.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.966
( shuts drawer )

14:25.999 --> 14:27.134
Well now, did they?

14:27.167 --> 14:30.003
No. I was being
hypothetical.

14:30.037 --> 14:32.172
( weak laugh )

14:32.205 --> 14:33.606
Do you guys
have a warrant?

14:33.640 --> 14:35.308
'Cause if you don't,
nothing you find here

14:35.342 --> 14:36.476
will be admissible
in court.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.946
Unless, of course,
you have probable cause.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.280
That is exactly what we have.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.249
I don't know.
Just because
he wasn't home?

14:42.282 --> 14:43.550
Little girl,
what's your name?

14:43.583 --> 14:44.551
Simon Frankel.

14:44.584 --> 14:47.154
Okay. Listen, Urkel,

14:47.187 --> 14:48.088
we're here on
official business,

14:48.121 --> 14:50.157
so why don't you go back
to your dorm room

14:50.190 --> 14:51.658
and play Dungeon Master,

14:51.691 --> 14:53.226
and let professionals
do their work, okay?

14:53.260 --> 14:54.627
I'm just trying to help.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.063
TONY:
You want to be
a big help?

14:56.096 --> 14:57.998
Yeah. Definitely.

14:58.031 --> 14:59.466
Okay.
Put your hands in the air.

14:59.499 --> 15:02.135
Nothing to be worried about.
Spread your legs.

15:02.169 --> 15:03.436
Okay, stick out
your tongue.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.905
You're the gargoyle
that guards this door.

15:09.109 --> 15:10.343
That was nice.

15:10.377 --> 15:12.579
But they don't pay us
to be nice, McGee.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.982
Hey!
Put on some gloves.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.420
There is definitely something
wrong with this guy.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.222
What?

15:22.255 --> 15:23.256
Listens to folk music.

15:25.993 --> 15:27.194
Hello.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.361
There's something else

15:28.395 --> 15:30.330
wrong with this guy too, Tony.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.435
A bloody rag.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.270
Nice work, McGee.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.974
That's a lot
of blood loss.

15:41.008 --> 15:42.175
Injured?

15:42.209 --> 15:43.977
Or dead?

15:45.778 --> 15:47.714
TONY:
Message on the left

15:47.747 --> 15:50.050
was on Turner's laptop.

15:50.083 --> 15:52.152
Message on the right
was found on Blake's.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.586
He received it

15:53.620 --> 15:55.055
on Saturday, boss.
Who sent them?

15:55.088 --> 15:56.356
McGee's working on it.

15:56.389 --> 15:58.025
What else do we know?

15:58.058 --> 16:00.260
No one on campus has heard
from Blake since Friday.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.262
And Abby says that the
blood on the rag and bed

16:02.295 --> 16:03.430
matches Blake's type.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.098
Two enlisted men:
One missing,

16:05.132 --> 16:07.134
one dead--
what do they have in common?

16:07.167 --> 16:09.069
The resentment of
the Coalition Alliance Team

16:09.102 --> 16:10.203
for Peace, Gibbs.

16:10.237 --> 16:12.072
Cat-Pee.
Not a very attractive acronym.

16:12.105 --> 16:14.741
Their leader's a Waverly senior,
Hunter Huxley.

16:14.774 --> 16:18.078
He's been arrested five times
for disturbing the peace.

16:18.111 --> 16:20.680
He's majoring in
political science...
Minoring in

16:20.713 --> 16:22.582
antigovernment subversion
and sticking it to The Man.

16:22.615 --> 16:23.750
I dated a girl
like that

16:23.783 --> 16:24.984
in college once, boss.

16:25.018 --> 16:27.554
Wasn't bad till she stopped
shaving her armpits and her...

16:29.522 --> 16:30.623
She owns a car
dealership now,

16:30.657 --> 16:31.724
in case you were looking
for a good deal.

16:31.758 --> 16:34.727
Huxley's been leading the
antiwar protests on campus,

16:34.761 --> 16:37.197
and last month,
at a peace demonstration

16:37.230 --> 16:39.466
in front of the NROTC building,
we know that he started

16:39.499 --> 16:40.767
spitting on midshipmen.

16:40.800 --> 16:41.768
And Sergeant Turner dropped him.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.236
After that,
Huxley made Turner

16:43.270 --> 16:45.072
his personal target.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.139
Harassed him regularly.

16:46.173 --> 16:48.108
You think he could've taken it
to the next level?

16:48.141 --> 16:50.009
I think you and Kate
are gonna go find out.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.513
Hey, turn that frown
upside down, sweetie.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.382
We're going back to college.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.384
Tony, your problem is
you've never left.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.553
This is what
I'm talking about.

17:00.587 --> 17:02.522
It's like I'm having
flashbacks or something.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.157
I'm surprised you even
remember college.

17:04.191 --> 17:06.526
You spent most of it
throwing up in a urinal.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.428
Well, I'm pretty sure you spent
your Saturday nights alone,

17:08.461 --> 17:10.463
in your PJs,
watching Julia Roberts videos.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.432
Oh, you don't know
what I did in college.

17:12.465 --> 17:14.467
Mm, but I do know what
you did on your Spring Break.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.704
I knew it! You still have
that wet T-shirt photo,

17:17.737 --> 17:18.705
don't you?
I don't.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.440
You swear?

17:20.473 --> 17:22.509
Well, I don't
have it on me.

17:22.542 --> 17:23.776
A-Chi! Way to go!

17:23.810 --> 17:24.777
Yeah.

17:24.811 --> 17:25.678
God, you're
pathetic.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.814
Gotta move on, DiNozzo.
They're over.

17:27.847 --> 17:29.549
What's over?

17:29.582 --> 17:31.551
Your glory years.
They've passed you by.

17:31.584 --> 17:32.752
It's time to retire
the beer bong.

17:32.785 --> 17:34.487
Ouch, Kate. Ouch.

17:34.521 --> 17:35.755
Oh...

17:35.788 --> 17:37.824
There's our budding anarchist.

17:37.857 --> 17:41.128
...is the puppet
of corporate America!

17:41.161 --> 17:42.595
This is an immoral act!

17:42.629 --> 17:44.464
No... more... war!

17:44.497 --> 17:47.367
( all chanting ):
No more war!

17:47.400 --> 17:49.569
No more war!

17:49.602 --> 17:52.639
Learn the truth
about this war!

17:52.672 --> 17:53.640
Your government
doesn't trust you,

17:53.673 --> 17:54.474
don't trust your government!

17:54.507 --> 17:56.376
Hey, man, help us
defeat Big Brother?

17:56.409 --> 17:58.278
We kind of work
for him.

17:58.311 --> 17:59.879
Agents Todd
and DiNozzo, NCIS.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.581
I got a permit to be here.

18:01.614 --> 18:02.615
I'm sure you do.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.584
That's not the reason
we're here, Mr. Huxley.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.587
Sergeant Joseph Turner.

18:07.620 --> 18:08.755
( Hunter groans )

18:08.788 --> 18:10.123
If he's pressing charges on me,

18:10.157 --> 18:11.358
then I'm pressing charges
on him.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.660
That fascist nearly
broke my jaw.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.628
I'd hold off
on the charges.

18:15.662 --> 18:17.297
He's dead.

18:17.330 --> 18:19.666
What?!

18:19.699 --> 18:21.768
His body was found on campus
Saturday night.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.336
You hadn't heard
about that?

18:23.370 --> 18:26.273
I've, uh, I been out of town.
I just got back today.

18:26.306 --> 18:27.507
That's convenient.

18:27.540 --> 18:28.841
Hold on a second.
You think I did it?

18:28.875 --> 18:30.910
Well, you two didn't
exactly get along.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.879
Well, yeah, because tried
to beat the crap out of me.

18:32.912 --> 18:34.414
After you spit on him.

18:34.447 --> 18:37.484
You do realize
I'm a peace activist, right?

18:37.517 --> 18:38.751
Anti-violence.

18:38.785 --> 18:43.356
Maybe you knew his friend, too?
Petty Officer Finnegan Blake?

18:43.390 --> 18:45.725
He was a midshipman.
Been missing since Friday.

18:47.527 --> 18:50.197
I get it!

18:50.230 --> 18:52.232
So this is how it happens, huh?

18:52.265 --> 18:53.833
They send
their Gestapo goons

18:53.866 --> 18:55.768
to try and quiet the movement.

18:55.802 --> 18:58.871
You planning on
arresting me?

18:58.905 --> 19:00.840
It's crossed our minds.
Do it.

19:00.873 --> 19:03.643
I'm not afraid of you;
I'm not afraid of your tactics.

19:03.676 --> 19:07.247
You should really
meet our boss.
He'd like you.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.781
And you should
really meet my lawyers.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.750
They'd love you.

19:12.219 --> 19:14.454
The student organizations alone
are mind-blowing.

19:14.487 --> 19:15.755
Did you know that
there are seven online

19:15.788 --> 19:17.257
mystery writer workshops
on campus?

19:17.290 --> 19:18.391
GIBBS:
No, I didn't.

19:18.425 --> 19:20.593
But I'm sure you're going to
tell me what that has to do

19:20.627 --> 19:22.229
with our dead Marine.

19:22.262 --> 19:23.396
I thought that
whoever was involved

19:23.430 --> 19:24.497
in Turner's death
might have

19:24.531 --> 19:26.599
a campus Web account, so I
hacked into the servers,

19:26.633 --> 19:28.735
looking for any mention
of Turner or Blake.

19:28.768 --> 19:29.902
Okay. Any hits?

19:29.936 --> 19:32.805
No-- the servers
have been pretty quiet.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.674
( laptop chimes )

19:34.707 --> 19:36.709
What is that?

19:36.743 --> 19:39.646
McGEE:
Someone's IM'ing
Sergeant Turner.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.681
It's an "Instant Message,"
Gibbs.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.750
It's like an e-mail,
but live.

19:43.783 --> 19:46.519
Just put it up on the plasma.

19:47.554 --> 19:50.790
CREEPY ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Hello, NCIS.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.859
He's not on
Turner's buddy list.

19:52.892 --> 19:54.327
He's probably using an alias.

19:54.361 --> 19:55.562
Can you trace it, McGee?

19:55.595 --> 19:56.863
If we can
keep him online.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.665
Abby, talk to him.
Okay.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.769
Hello, Creepy Voice.

20:02.802 --> 20:03.903
( computer chimes )

20:03.936 --> 20:06.873
CREEPY VOICE:
You're looking
in the wrong places.

20:06.906 --> 20:09.376
McGEE:
He's diverting his connection
through half a dozen servers.

20:09.409 --> 20:11.878
We've got
the Baltimore Public Library

20:11.911 --> 20:13.313
by way of a public
server in Buffalo...

20:13.346 --> 20:15.382
That's it-- get him.
Get him, McGee.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.783
ABBY:
Where should

20:16.816 --> 20:19.819
we be looking?

20:19.852 --> 20:20.720
CREEPY VOICE:
Deeper.

20:20.753 --> 20:23.290
Oh, come on.
How's that gonna help us?

20:23.323 --> 20:25.992
McGEE:
I've back-traced him to the
Waverly University campus.

20:26.025 --> 20:27.827
Where on campus?

20:27.860 --> 20:28.695
Almost there.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.797
CREEPY VOICE:
Look beyond the surface.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.865
Oh, that's a
really sucky clue.

20:32.899 --> 20:35.868
When you say
"beyond the surface,"

20:35.902 --> 20:39.672
are you being literal
or metaphorical?

20:41.073 --> 20:42.709
I'm just trying to clarify.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.511
CREEPY VOICE:
They're everywhere.

20:44.544 --> 20:46.012
McGEE:
Okay, I've got it down
to one city block.

20:46.045 --> 20:48.681
Right off of campus.
Just one more second...

20:49.649 --> 20:51.418
CREEPY VOICE:
Goodbye.

20:51.451 --> 20:52.885
Got him, boss!

20:53.820 --> 20:55.855
Yeah.

20:56.889 --> 20:58.591
GIBBS:
You are sure about this, right?

20:58.625 --> 21:00.593
I was able to
triangulate the connection

21:00.627 --> 21:01.661
to the campus servers,

21:01.694 --> 21:02.895
and then reran the back-trace...

21:02.929 --> 21:05.532
GIBBS:
Just answer the question, McGee.

21:05.565 --> 21:07.400
Yes. I'm sure, boss.

21:07.434 --> 21:09.068
Let's do this.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.503
Kate, cover the back.

21:12.639 --> 21:17.410
( rock music blaring
inside )

21:17.444 --> 21:19.512
WOMAN:
No, no! Stop!

21:19.546 --> 21:20.947
( woman screaming )

21:20.980 --> 21:22.014
Federal agents!

21:22.048 --> 21:22.682
Don't move!

21:22.715 --> 21:24.984
( all shrieking )

21:25.017 --> 21:27.854
( rock music blaring )

21:31.958 --> 21:33.726
I am going to kill McGee.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.027
( excited murmuring )

21:35.061 --> 21:37.830
We got it covered, Kate!

21:47.039 --> 21:49.442
McGEE:
So, is Gibbs still mad at me?

21:49.476 --> 21:51.411
About what, Probie?

21:51.444 --> 21:52.479
Dead Marine on campus?

21:52.512 --> 21:54.614
The missing
Petty Officer?

21:54.647 --> 21:56.816
Computer hacker
who might be part

21:56.849 --> 21:58.418
of a radical
peace movement?

21:58.451 --> 22:02.355
None of these things
are your fault... really.

22:02.389 --> 22:05.024
But sending Gibbs
on a panty raid?

22:05.057 --> 22:06.659
He's going to kill you.

22:06.693 --> 22:08.127
GIBBS:
Hey!

22:08.160 --> 22:10.730
I want answers.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.902
Where is Abby?

22:15.935 --> 22:17.470
Uh, she's on a run

22:17.504 --> 22:19.472
to the evidence
garage, boss.

22:23.943 --> 22:26.879
She's on a run
to the evidence garage, boss.

22:26.913 --> 22:29.482
Anything on the hacker?

22:31.651 --> 22:33.152
Um,

22:33.185 --> 22:35.422
he was on a wireless connection.

22:35.455 --> 22:36.523
The house you hit

22:36.556 --> 22:38.525
was set up
for WiFi.

22:38.558 --> 22:40.527
He was probably sitting
somewhere outside on the street.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.662
But I'm working
on tracing him
right now.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.831
You tell Abby I want her.

22:44.864 --> 22:47.600
ABBY:
Oh, Gibbs, I never knew!

22:48.735 --> 22:50.437
Ducky asked me
to help him

22:50.470 --> 22:51.804
figure out where
the welts came from.

22:51.838 --> 22:53.540
I think I'm gonna start
with the ball peen hammer.

22:53.573 --> 22:55.007
I don't know why.
I just like the way

22:55.041 --> 22:56.876
it sounds-- ball peen,
ball peen, ball peen, ball

22:56.909 --> 22:58.177
peen, ball...
GIBBS:
What else?

22:58.210 --> 22:59.479
Um, probably go
with the stun gun,

22:59.512 --> 23:01.180
and then the
Garden Weasel.

23:01.213 --> 23:04.617
And someone is in
a really bad mood.

23:06.118 --> 23:07.587
Spending the night
in a room full

23:07.620 --> 23:10.523
of crying women
tends to do
that to me.

23:10.557 --> 23:12.592
Well, this will
cheer you up.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.427
I got the analysis back
from the blood

23:14.461 --> 23:15.728
found on Turner's body.

23:15.762 --> 23:17.664
It belongs to your
missing petty officer.

23:17.697 --> 23:19.766
Blake? You're kidding.

23:19.799 --> 23:21.734
I also ran the bloody rag
from Blake's house.

23:21.768 --> 23:23.936
Most of it is his,
and some of it is not.

23:23.970 --> 23:25.705
Sergeant Turner's?
Bingo.

23:25.738 --> 23:26.873
Was his name-o.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.541
Blake and Turner
were in a fight.

23:28.575 --> 23:30.610
And one turns up dead
and the other hits the road.

23:30.643 --> 23:33.179
Or they were killed together
at the same location, Kate.

23:33.212 --> 23:34.413
( computer beeps )

23:35.915 --> 23:37.049
It's the hacker.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.752
He's sending us
another instant message.

23:39.786 --> 23:43.490
COMPUTER VOICE ( filtered ):
NCIS, if you want the truth,

23:43.523 --> 23:47.927
be at Unity Quad,
ten-hundred hours today.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.630
MCGEE:
He's somewhere
on campus right now.

23:50.663 --> 23:51.931
Tony, Kate, you're with me.

23:51.964 --> 23:53.633
And you get me

23:53.666 --> 23:55.234
an exact location
this time.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.470
You sure you can do it?

23:57.504 --> 23:58.805
Positive.

23:58.838 --> 24:02.008
I think.

24:02.041 --> 24:03.009
Excuse me.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.176
How can we be sure

24:04.210 --> 24:05.144
Creepy Voice
is even here, McGee?

24:05.177 --> 24:07.179
( over wireless ):
Because, Tony,

24:07.213 --> 24:08.948
the campus WiFi system
is broken down

24:08.981 --> 24:10.550
into nodes,
and our hacker's signal

24:10.583 --> 24:11.784
is coming from Node Five.

24:11.818 --> 24:13.653
Yeah? What does
that mean? Hi.

24:13.686 --> 24:14.654
It means he's

24:14.687 --> 24:15.655
somewhere in the quad right now.

24:15.688 --> 24:16.523
So look for somebody

24:16.556 --> 24:17.990
with a laptop
or a wireless device.

24:18.024 --> 24:19.559
Not real helpful, Probie.

24:19.592 --> 24:21.193
GIBBS:
Less chatter.

24:21.227 --> 24:22.729
Keep your eyes open.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.196
Find him... or her.

24:27.834 --> 24:29.969
Boss, your 1:00.

24:30.002 --> 24:33.540
Red hat, sunglasses,
looking real suspicious.

24:38.878 --> 24:41.548
That's what I'm
talking about.

24:41.581 --> 24:42.915
Don't you get enough
of that at home?

24:42.949 --> 24:45.685
My Internet
connection's down.

24:45.718 --> 24:47.153
( laughs ):
Yeah.

24:47.186 --> 24:49.656
It's 10:45.

24:49.689 --> 24:50.890
The hacker's playing
with us again.

24:50.923 --> 24:52.592
No, Kate, I'm telling you
he's here.

24:52.625 --> 24:54.594
Look for something abnormal.

24:54.627 --> 24:57.530
You're gonna have
to be more specific, McGee.

24:57.564 --> 24:59.666
MAN:
Look out! Move!
Out of the way!

24:59.699 --> 25:00.800
Hey, watch it!

25:00.833 --> 25:02.134
( panting )

25:04.303 --> 25:05.104
Move it!

25:05.137 --> 25:07.006
I'd say that's
abnormal.

25:08.875 --> 25:10.743
TONY:
We've got two suspects,
one in a black ski mask.

25:10.777 --> 25:12.745
Moving to intercept.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.815
TONY:
They're coming out
of the tunnel.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.116
Okay.

25:17.149 --> 25:18.985
Hey, get out
of the way!

25:19.018 --> 25:20.119
Move it!
Get out of the way!

25:23.189 --> 25:23.790
Hey!

25:23.823 --> 25:25.558
SUSPECT:
Clear the way!

25:25.592 --> 25:26.759
Get out of my way!

25:30.663 --> 25:32.264
You're dead!
( grunting )

25:32.298 --> 25:33.733
KATE:
He's got a gun!

25:33.766 --> 25:35.568
NCIS! Federal agents!
Drop the weapon!

25:35.602 --> 25:36.869
KATE:
Put down
your weapon!

25:36.903 --> 25:37.837
TONY:
Drop the weapon!

25:37.870 --> 25:39.739
Hold your fire!

25:43.910 --> 25:45.211
What's going on?

25:46.913 --> 25:49.115
Shut up, dumbass.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.018
That hurt?
Yeah.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.686
That hurt, right there?
( shudders )

25:53.720 --> 25:55.221
Yeah.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.891
"Kyle Zolin."
He's a midshipman.

25:58.925 --> 25:59.892
( phone rings )

25:59.926 --> 26:02.194
Yeah.
Gibbs.

26:02.228 --> 26:04.296
Gibbs, Gibbs, I figured it out.

26:04.330 --> 26:06.633
I know what caused the welts
on Turner's body.

26:06.666 --> 26:08.735
We know.
A paintball gun.

26:08.768 --> 26:11.671
( dial tone )

26:11.704 --> 26:15.207
I really, really hate it
when he does that.

26:17.844 --> 26:20.980
( "Peter Gunn" theme plays )

26:25.351 --> 26:26.853
( shot fires )

26:34.961 --> 26:35.928
Whoops.

26:35.962 --> 26:37.997
You retreads think you deserve
to be officers?!

26:38.030 --> 26:39.398
Do you?!

26:39.431 --> 26:42.268
Playing illegal
games on campus?!

26:42.301 --> 26:44.704
You're lucky I don't rip your
heads off and stomp on them!

26:44.737 --> 26:47.239
Agent Gibbs'll take it
from here, Gunny.

26:47.273 --> 26:48.307
Yes, sir.

26:50.042 --> 26:53.813
I expect you gentlemen to answer
his questions truthfully.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.651
Sit down.

27:05.324 --> 27:06.793
Where's Finnegan Blake?

27:09.061 --> 27:11.764
We don't know, sir.

27:14.366 --> 27:15.267
How many midshipmen

27:15.301 --> 27:17.670
in this little paintball club
of yours?

27:17.704 --> 27:22.208
Uh... yeah,
that's right.

27:22.241 --> 27:23.442
You turn them in,
they'll probably

27:23.475 --> 27:25.311
be kicked out of school
just like you.

27:26.378 --> 27:28.347
It's admirable;

27:28.380 --> 27:30.049
protecting your friends.

27:31.383 --> 27:35.788
Turner does not need protection.

27:37.724 --> 27:39.325
He's lying dead

27:39.358 --> 27:43.129
on a slab
with a broken neck.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.464
I think Blake is the one
who put him there.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.465
No.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.801
No, not possible, sir.

27:48.835 --> 27:50.436
They were best friends.

27:50.469 --> 27:51.470
Yeah?

27:51.503 --> 27:52.939
Then why were they beating

27:52.972 --> 27:54.907
the crap out of each other
Friday night?

27:56.375 --> 27:57.710
You were there!

27:57.744 --> 28:00.479
Yes, sir,
but it's not what you think.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.882
They tossed
a couple punches,

28:02.915 --> 28:04.116
we broke it up.

28:04.150 --> 28:06.986
An hour later,
they were drinking beer
and laughing about it.

28:07.019 --> 28:10.289
Does that look like a couple
of punches to you, Midshipmen?

28:10.322 --> 28:13.392
His neck
is snapped in half.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.864
He, uh... he didn't
look like that

28:17.897 --> 28:19.498
when he left.

28:19.531 --> 28:22.902
What was the fight about?

28:22.935 --> 28:24.971
Turner never lost
a paintball game,

28:25.004 --> 28:27.740
so Blake decided
to change the rules.

28:27.774 --> 28:29.475
By killing him.

28:29.508 --> 28:31.010
No, sir.

28:31.043 --> 28:32.879
We play one on one,

28:32.912 --> 28:35.381
but Friday morning we
all got Turner's target photo

28:35.414 --> 28:37.449
in our e-mail.

28:37.483 --> 28:39.786
And we ambushed him.

28:39.819 --> 28:40.787
It was supposed

28:40.820 --> 28:44.223
to be funny.

28:46.492 --> 28:47.526
I want the names

28:47.559 --> 28:50.797
of everyone
in your club.

28:52.799 --> 28:53.565
You do that,

28:53.599 --> 28:55.534
and we can talk
about your futures.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.870
And if we don't?

28:57.904 --> 28:59.505
Son, you trust me.

28:59.538 --> 29:03.742
You will not do well
in prison.

29:04.844 --> 29:06.879
KATE:
They call themselves
"The Red Cell."

29:06.913 --> 29:08.881
They all claim the last time
they saw Blake was on

29:08.915 --> 29:10.416
Friday night,
right after the fight.

29:10.449 --> 29:12.318
We think they were
protecting him.

29:12.351 --> 29:13.820
Who else knew
about the group?

29:13.853 --> 29:15.087
According to them, no one.

29:15.121 --> 29:16.355
Only the Red Cell
members.

29:16.388 --> 29:17.456
First rule of Fight Club:

29:17.489 --> 29:19.125
Never talk about Fight Club.

29:19.158 --> 29:22.061
God, that's a great movie.
Brad Pitt, Edward Norton.

29:22.094 --> 29:23.429
It's, like,
the greatest

29:23.462 --> 29:24.430
guy movie ever.

29:24.463 --> 29:26.398
I'm going to rent that for you.

29:26.432 --> 29:29.268
They're either lying,

29:29.301 --> 29:31.037
or one of them
is the hacker

29:31.070 --> 29:32.271
that led us
to the group.

29:32.304 --> 29:33.272
Find them.

29:33.305 --> 29:34.306
Boss?

29:34.340 --> 29:35.574
Find my hacker yet?

29:35.607 --> 29:36.575
Uh, no, but...?

29:36.608 --> 29:39.111
Poor Probie.

29:39.145 --> 29:40.479
You think he needs
a group hug?
Oh.

29:40.512 --> 29:42.181
I found Blake.

29:47.519 --> 29:49.989
I've been monitoring
the campus WiFi nodes,

29:50.022 --> 29:51.991
waiting for the hacker
to come back online,

29:52.024 --> 29:53.359
and that's when
I thought of it.

29:53.392 --> 29:54.493
When we searched
Blake's room,

29:54.526 --> 29:55.594
he had the
docking station

29:55.627 --> 29:57.263
for an Axim X5
handheld computer,

29:57.296 --> 30:00.099
but the unit itself
was not in his room.

30:00.132 --> 30:01.100
And they're, like,

30:01.133 --> 30:02.134
2,000 bucks.

30:02.168 --> 30:03.469
He probably took it
with him

30:03.502 --> 30:04.837
when he pulled
his disappearing act.

30:04.871 --> 30:05.905
Why does this matter?

30:05.938 --> 30:07.539
Because it has
wireless built in.

30:07.573 --> 30:10.209
It automatically connects
to the nearest network.

30:10.242 --> 30:11.543
He's online right now.

30:11.577 --> 30:13.846
Where?

30:13.880 --> 30:15.181
Waverly University,
Node Three.

30:15.214 --> 30:16.215
And according
to the network logs,

30:16.248 --> 30:18.284
he's been hiding out there
since Saturday morning.

30:18.317 --> 30:19.318
Not bad, McGee.

30:19.351 --> 30:21.253
Let's roll.

30:21.287 --> 30:24.891
See? I told you
he likes you.

30:26.893 --> 30:28.227
You sure
about this, Tim?

30:28.260 --> 30:29.128
I'm sure.

30:29.161 --> 30:32.364
He's here,
or at least his computer is.

30:32.398 --> 30:35.501
Well, I hope for your sake
that you're right.

30:35.534 --> 30:38.104
I'm right, okay?

30:38.137 --> 30:40.306
( device beeping )

30:40.339 --> 30:42.341
Wait.

30:43.542 --> 30:46.412
He's in the building
right behind this one.

30:51.683 --> 30:54.620
Got some bad news
for you, Probie.

30:54.653 --> 30:55.621
I don't understand.

30:55.654 --> 30:56.455
He should be here.

30:56.488 --> 30:58.657
Maybe he disappeared
with the building.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.426
I'm telling you, it's here.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.264
( beeping continues )

31:05.297 --> 31:07.866
The signal's getting stronger.

31:09.335 --> 31:10.636
( device beeping )

31:13.472 --> 31:15.374
It's here!

31:15.407 --> 31:16.608
Where?

31:16.642 --> 31:17.977
( beeping continues )

31:18.010 --> 31:19.478
It's right below me.

31:19.511 --> 31:21.580
He must have buried it.

31:22.481 --> 31:24.050
TONY:
We're being screwed
with again.

31:24.083 --> 31:25.484
It's the hacker, McGee.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.086
I found something!

31:30.422 --> 31:31.590
It's a body.

31:31.623 --> 31:32.959
It's laying face down.

31:32.992 --> 31:34.560
This is where
the head should be.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.967
He's wearing a hood.

31:41.733 --> 31:44.336
This is now
a crime scene.

31:51.643 --> 31:52.945
McGEE:
It's Blake.

31:52.979 --> 31:55.982
He's not lying
face down.

32:02.454 --> 32:06.025
Petty Officer Blake was killed
early Saturday morning

32:06.058 --> 32:09.361
just hours after
Sergeant Turner's death.

32:09.395 --> 32:10.529
Now we're dealing with
a killer

32:10.562 --> 32:11.630
who's not only
extremely powerful,

32:11.663 --> 32:13.265
but methodical.

32:13.299 --> 32:14.500
Each of these young men

32:14.533 --> 32:16.668
had their necks broken
in a violent

32:16.702 --> 32:18.504
and identical fashion.

32:18.537 --> 32:21.073
I think by someone using
their bare hands.

32:21.107 --> 32:22.474
Well, how's that?

32:22.508 --> 32:23.375
Ah.

32:23.409 --> 32:25.077
Well, it's a very
specific technique.

32:25.111 --> 32:27.179
May I demonstrate,

32:27.213 --> 32:28.647
Mr. Palmer?
Of course, Doctor.

32:28.680 --> 32:31.050
Yes, well, one hand is placed
firmly on the jaw here.

32:31.083 --> 32:32.418
And the other hand...
I'll do it, Duck.

32:32.451 --> 32:33.986
Ah.

32:34.020 --> 32:35.454
Thank you,
Jethro.
This ought to be good.

32:35.487 --> 32:36.655
No, on you.

32:36.688 --> 32:39.191
You think that's
really necessary?
Yeah, it'll be fun.

32:39.225 --> 32:42.461
You can either lie
on the floor, or I'll
drop you on the floor.

32:42.494 --> 32:43.562
We used this to silence

32:43.595 --> 32:45.364
enemy sentries.
One hand on the
jaw, the other

32:45.397 --> 32:46.432
behind the head
of the individual.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.300
66 pounds of torque

32:48.334 --> 32:50.536
and snap, snap, snap!

32:50.569 --> 32:52.438
Your eyes are in the back
of your head, DiNozzo.

32:52.471 --> 32:53.472
Any questions?

32:53.505 --> 32:55.307
No, I think I got it, boss.

32:57.409 --> 32:58.477
You missed your
calling, boss.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.012
Could've been
a chiropractor.

33:00.046 --> 33:02.114
We're looking for someone
who knows how to kill.

33:02.148 --> 33:05.451
DUCKY:
Yes, but what troubles me
is our midshipmen,

33:05.484 --> 33:07.486
in order to receive
such a killing blow,

33:07.519 --> 33:09.688
would have to have been
face-to-face

33:09.721 --> 33:10.889
with their assailant.

33:10.922 --> 33:13.292
Which means either
they were ambushed or...
They knew him.

33:13.325 --> 33:16.395
Hey. Another midshipman?

33:16.428 --> 33:19.165
They teach combat courses
at an NROTC unit.

33:19.198 --> 33:20.532
Maybe. You found my hacker yet?

33:20.566 --> 33:21.433
McGee's upstairs

33:21.467 --> 33:22.468
working on it.

33:22.501 --> 33:23.602
I didn't ask McGee.

33:23.635 --> 33:25.704
I asked my senior
field agent.

33:27.073 --> 33:28.674
I want that damn hacker.

33:30.342 --> 33:31.543
Did you hear that,
Palmer?

33:31.577 --> 33:32.711
Yeah, he sounded
pretty upset.

33:32.744 --> 33:35.081
No, he called me

33:35.114 --> 33:37.049
his seni field agent.

33:37.083 --> 33:38.217
Finally!

33:43.389 --> 33:44.690
This guy's good, Abby.

33:44.723 --> 33:47.693
He's too good.

33:47.726 --> 33:48.694
Yeah, but we...

33:48.727 --> 33:50.262
are better!

33:50.296 --> 33:52.631
I thought
you went to MIT.

33:52.664 --> 33:55.267
Abby, I don't think
I can track this guy.

33:55.301 --> 33:56.502
Don't let Gibbs hear you

33:56.535 --> 33:57.703
talking like that,
Probie.

33:57.736 --> 33:59.505
Caff-Pow, baby.

33:59.538 --> 34:02.141
You guys are just in time
for McGee's crisis of faith.

34:02.174 --> 34:04.576
He's starting to realize
that there may be

34:04.610 --> 34:06.812
someone on the planet
that's smarter than him.

34:06.845 --> 34:08.380
Oh, I'm looking at
one right now.

34:08.414 --> 34:09.648
Well, Kate,
in all fairness, I am

34:09.681 --> 34:10.582
the senior field agent,

34:10.616 --> 34:12.218
but I think it's an
experience thing...

34:12.251 --> 34:13.819
I was talking about
Abby, dodo head.

34:13.852 --> 34:16.088
Thank you, Kate.

34:16.122 --> 34:17.523
McGEE:
Okay, the only
chance we have

34:17.556 --> 34:19.758
of finding this guy
is if he contacts us again.

34:19.791 --> 34:21.527
I can embed a virus
in the IM software.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.195
Use it to tag his computer

34:23.229 --> 34:24.563
and hope that it leads...

34:24.596 --> 34:26.098
Viruses,
tracking software?

34:26.132 --> 34:28.667
You guys are going about
this the wrong way.

34:28.700 --> 34:31.637
What is the first rule
of Fight Club, Probie?

34:31.670 --> 34:34.173
Okay, Tony, you can barely
turn your computer on.

34:34.206 --> 34:35.207
So, no offense...

34:35.241 --> 34:36.575
You do not talk...

34:36.608 --> 34:38.444
about Fight Club!

34:38.477 --> 34:39.845
And what is the second rule

34:39.878 --> 34:41.680
of Fight Club?

34:41.713 --> 34:42.848
Abbs?

34:42.881 --> 34:45.384
Do not talk about Fight Club!

34:45.417 --> 34:46.718
( clears throat )
Sir!

34:46.752 --> 34:49.188
Exactly.

34:49.221 --> 34:51.557
And Creepy Voice is the guy
who led us to Red Cell.

34:51.590 --> 34:54.293
So he's either a member
or he knows a member.

34:54.326 --> 34:55.494
And they're all midshipmen.

34:55.527 --> 34:56.595
Of course,
if the guy's

34:56.628 --> 34:57.629
giving McGeek
a run for his money,

34:57.663 --> 34:58.697
he's got to be pretty smart.

34:58.730 --> 34:59.698
McGee, what was your

34:59.731 --> 35:00.866
GPA in college?

35:00.899 --> 35:03.669
3.9.

35:03.702 --> 35:06.372
I failed a fencing
class in sophomore year.

35:06.405 --> 35:09.741
So I'm sure you already checked
the NROTC records,

35:09.775 --> 35:14.246
to make sure there's no
computer genius in the unit.

35:17.749 --> 35:18.717
KATE:
I hate to say it,

35:18.750 --> 35:20.452
but that was
actually smart, Tony.

35:20.486 --> 35:21.653
What was, Kate?

35:21.687 --> 35:23.389
Tony might have figured
out how to find

35:23.422 --> 35:25.591
the hacker.
It's his job.

35:25.624 --> 35:28.160
You think I keep him around
for his personality?

35:28.194 --> 35:29.561
( sputtering laugh )

35:29.595 --> 35:31.563
There are 22 midshipmen
in the unit

35:31.597 --> 35:32.698
with computer science majors.

35:32.731 --> 35:34.666
Only one of them
has a 4.0.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.268
Look familiar?

35:36.302 --> 35:37.836
You want to bring
him in with me?

35:37.869 --> 35:39.671
Considering he
embarrassed me,

35:39.705 --> 35:41.607
almost got me fired
and ruined my weekend?

35:41.640 --> 35:42.808
What do you think?

35:45.844 --> 35:47.646
( computer beeps )

35:47.679 --> 35:49.881
FILTERED VOICE:
Hello, NCIS.

35:49.915 --> 35:54.720
You might be smart,
but my geek carries a gun.

35:54.753 --> 36:01.627
Hello, you twisted piece of...

36:26.252 --> 36:28.387
Howdy, Urkel.

36:28.420 --> 36:29.555
Ow! Man, you're
hurting me!

36:29.588 --> 36:30.422
Ow!

36:30.456 --> 36:32.524
You hear
something,
Tony?
No.

36:32.558 --> 36:34.493
Me, neither.

36:37.028 --> 36:39.765
No need to worry.
Federal agents.

36:39.798 --> 36:41.467
Have a nice day.

36:46.372 --> 36:48.307
FRANKEL:
Hey.

36:48.340 --> 36:49.741
So what do
they call it?

36:49.775 --> 36:51.577
The box?
Coffin?

36:51.610 --> 36:52.644
Sweat shop?

36:52.678 --> 36:54.813
We just call it interrogation.

36:54.846 --> 36:55.647
What's the deal?

36:55.681 --> 36:57.449
You lean on me first,

36:57.483 --> 36:58.850
then bring your partner in,
get me blabbering?

36:58.884 --> 37:02.654
Are you the good cop
or the bad cop?
Sit.

37:02.688 --> 37:03.989
Okay.

37:04.022 --> 37:06.692
I'm gonna be honest
with you.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.560
This is a major
waste of time.

37:08.594 --> 37:10.529
You clearly
didn't do this.

37:11.897 --> 37:14.666
Reverse psychology.

37:14.700 --> 37:17.603
But my boss, he needs
to close the case.

37:17.636 --> 37:18.504
Brass wants answers.

37:18.537 --> 37:23.342
And there is
this other agent-- Kate...

37:23.375 --> 37:25.877
Severe-looking thing.

37:25.911 --> 37:27.479
No sense of humor.

37:27.513 --> 37:28.747
She built a profile on you.

37:28.780 --> 37:30.882
What kind of interrogation
technique is that?

37:30.916 --> 37:34.920
The DiNozzo method.
Not pretty, but it's effective.

37:34.953 --> 37:36.788
Turns out...

37:37.789 --> 37:40.692
you're the geeks' geek.

37:40.726 --> 37:42.394
The last one to be picked
for the team.

37:42.428 --> 37:44.763
That's not true.

37:44.796 --> 37:48.334
This isn't me, Urkel.

37:48.367 --> 37:49.868
Okay? I think
you're great.

37:49.901 --> 37:51.136
Sure, you broke a few

37:51.169 --> 37:53.839
federal laws, interfering with
an ongoing murder investigation.

37:53.872 --> 37:55.607
I was trying to help you.

37:55.641 --> 37:57.042
Right.

37:58.677 --> 38:00.646
It's the way you did it
that's suspicious.

38:00.679 --> 38:03.782
Look at me, hmm?
The last thing I need

38:03.815 --> 38:05.851
is to be pegged as
a rat in the unit.

38:05.884 --> 38:07.319
Those guys would
have killed me.

38:07.353 --> 38:08.887
Maybe you were looking
for payback?

38:08.920 --> 38:09.988
They wouldn't let you

38:10.021 --> 38:12.591
into their
little club?
That's crazy.

38:12.624 --> 38:15.727
You know what's crazy?

38:15.761 --> 38:17.963
Me almost putting a bullet
in a kid's head

38:17.996 --> 38:19.765
'cause he's playing paint ball.

38:19.798 --> 38:22.534
That's a little crazy.

38:22.568 --> 38:24.403
I didn't...

38:24.436 --> 38:25.737
I didn't want
anyone to get hurt.

38:25.771 --> 38:27.005
I was...

38:27.038 --> 38:28.006
just trying to help.

38:28.039 --> 38:29.475
Turner was a friend.

38:29.508 --> 38:32.544
So you thought sending
cryptic e-mails

38:32.578 --> 38:35.814
was going to help us
find his killer?

38:35.847 --> 38:37.082
I think I know
who killed him.

38:37.115 --> 38:38.350
Who?

38:38.384 --> 38:41.420
Petty Officer Blake.

38:41.453 --> 38:42.588
Yeah, why'd he do it?

38:42.621 --> 38:44.623
There's this girl
in the unit--

38:44.656 --> 38:45.557
Ashley Simmons.

38:45.591 --> 38:47.359
She used to date Blake,
but they broke up.

38:47.393 --> 38:49.395
She started dating Turner?

38:49.428 --> 38:50.529
I'm not sure.

38:50.562 --> 38:53.665
I know he liked her.

38:53.699 --> 38:54.933
He liked her?

38:54.966 --> 38:56.835
Not a real strong
motive for murder,

38:56.868 --> 38:58.470
Urkel.

38:58.504 --> 39:00.038
Last week I saw
all three of them

39:00.071 --> 39:01.473
together in the quad.

39:01.507 --> 39:02.474
Ashley was crying.

39:02.508 --> 39:04.543
Turner and Blake started
arguing with each other.

39:04.576 --> 39:05.544
About what?

39:05.577 --> 39:07.579
I couldn't hear, but I saw

39:07.613 --> 39:08.814
Blake push him.

39:08.847 --> 39:10.816
So they fought?

39:10.849 --> 39:13.018
No, Turner just left
with Ashley.

39:13.051 --> 39:15.621
When I asked him about it later,
he said it was personal,

39:15.654 --> 39:19.658
something between
the three of them.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.760
Well, that's a real
interesting theory, Matlock.

39:21.793 --> 39:24.029
One problem.

39:24.062 --> 39:25.597
What?

39:25.631 --> 39:27.966
Blake's dead.

39:27.999 --> 39:30.402
He was murdered
a few hours after Turner.

39:30.436 --> 39:32.904
B-By who?

39:32.938 --> 39:34.673
Someone who wanted
to frame him

39:34.706 --> 39:36.475
for the murder
of his best friend.

39:39.545 --> 39:42.781
Find Midshipman
Ashley Simmons. Now.

39:44.950 --> 39:46.918
LEEKA:
Why is your hair
still purple, Simmons?

39:46.952 --> 39:49.855
It takes a few days
to wash out, Gunny.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.723
I hope the time you've
spent field-daying

39:51.757 --> 39:52.824
is starting to sink in.

39:52.858 --> 39:55.694
I own you until the day

39:55.727 --> 39:56.528
you graduate.

39:56.562 --> 39:59.531
Yes, Gunny.
It won't happen again.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.835
You want to give people
orders someday?

40:03.869 --> 40:06.505
You need to learn how
to follow them.

40:06.538 --> 40:07.873
Sounds like
pretty good advice,

40:07.906 --> 40:09.140
Gunny.

40:09.174 --> 40:10.776
Good evening, sir.

40:10.809 --> 40:12.611
Any luck
finding Blake?

40:12.644 --> 40:14.980
That's why we're here.

40:15.013 --> 40:16.515
We can talk about this
in my office.

40:16.548 --> 40:17.949
You missed a spot
over there, Simmons.

40:17.983 --> 40:19.718
Actually, we're here
for her, Gunny.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.152
Simmons?
For what?

40:21.186 --> 40:22.521
GIBBS:
We found Blake.

40:22.554 --> 40:23.889
Where?

40:23.922 --> 40:25.457
He's dead.
TONY:
We think she knows why.

40:25.491 --> 40:27.192
I don't, I don't know
anything about it.

40:27.225 --> 40:29.995
KATE:
Then you won't mind
answering a few questions.

40:30.028 --> 40:31.196
Take her out to the sedan.
I'll be right out.

40:31.229 --> 40:32.998
But I don't know anything!

40:33.031 --> 40:35.467
Tell me everything you
know about her, Gunny.

40:35.501 --> 40:37.102
Simmons?

40:38.904 --> 40:41.172
Kind of a screw-up,

40:41.206 --> 40:42.641
but not a bad kid.

40:42.674 --> 40:45.644
You think she's
involved in this?

40:45.677 --> 40:47.613
SIMMONS:
I don't understand.

40:47.646 --> 40:48.780
Blake didn't kill Turner?

40:48.814 --> 40:50.949
Nope, they were
both murdered.

40:50.982 --> 40:52.718
Not pretty.
Almost twisted his head

40:52.751 --> 40:54.920
clean off.

40:54.953 --> 40:56.822
Oh, my God,

40:56.855 --> 40:58.624
he did it.

41:00.258 --> 41:01.893
LEEKA:
I'm getting too old
for this crap.

41:01.927 --> 41:04.696
ROTC was supposed to be
an easy tour.

41:04.730 --> 41:05.731
You want a cup?

41:05.764 --> 41:08.033
Uh, no.
No, thanks, I'll pass.

41:08.066 --> 41:10.936
Mm. Good call.

41:10.969 --> 41:12.604
So just how was

41:12.638 --> 41:13.772
Blake murdered?

41:13.805 --> 41:15.273
I went to them

41:15.306 --> 41:17.108
for help last week.

41:17.142 --> 41:19.845
He wouldn't
leave me alone.

41:19.878 --> 41:23.081
Wow, two identical neck-breaks?

41:23.114 --> 41:26.017
Yeah, we think the killer
has military training.

41:26.051 --> 41:28.754
( sobbing ):
He was forcing me
to sleep with him.

41:28.787 --> 41:31.623
Blake and Turner were
going to go talk to
him, make him stop.

41:31.657 --> 41:33.725
And he killed them.

41:33.759 --> 41:35.561
Who, Midshipman?

41:35.594 --> 41:36.895
LEEKA:
I'll have everyone in this unit

41:36.928 --> 41:38.296
standing by tomorrow.

41:38.329 --> 41:40.666
You can question them
all at the same time.

41:40.699 --> 41:41.933
Thanks, Gunny.
Appreciate it.

41:41.967 --> 41:43.101
Just one thing.

41:43.134 --> 41:45.303
What, sir?

41:45.336 --> 41:47.939
I said that Blake
had been found dead.

41:47.973 --> 41:50.075
You said "murdered."

41:51.309 --> 41:53.745
( cell phone rings )

41:55.146 --> 41:56.314
( cell phone ringing )

41:56.347 --> 41:57.549
You gonna answer that?

41:57.583 --> 42:00.051
No.

42:00.085 --> 42:00.919
No, I'm pretty sure

42:00.952 --> 42:02.588
I know what it is
they want to tell me,

42:02.621 --> 42:03.889
Put your hands up.

42:12.631 --> 42:14.165
Not bad, Agent Gibbs.

42:14.199 --> 42:16.234
I'd give up now.
It's only going to get worse.

42:24.042 --> 42:25.210
( groans )

42:32.884 --> 42:34.953
( grunting )

42:36.154 --> 42:37.355
I think he knows.

42:37.388 --> 42:38.724
You think?

42:49.300 --> 42:50.869
( grunting )

42:50.902 --> 42:53.271
You should have stayed
out of this, old man.

42:53.304 --> 42:54.673
Okay, stand back.

42:55.707 --> 42:56.642
( groaning )

43:05.350 --> 43:06.351
Cuff him.

43:06.384 --> 43:07.653
TONY:
Sure thing, boss.

43:09.688 --> 43:11.056
Somehow I don't
remember college

43:11.089 --> 43:12.190
being quite like this.

43:12.223 --> 43:13.625
Reminds me
of this time

43:13.659 --> 43:15.627
at Ohio State,
we had this frat guy...

43:15.661 --> 43:17.929
The next person who
mentions a spring break

43:17.963 --> 43:19.765
or a frat party,

43:19.798 --> 43:22.267
or college... is fired,

43:22.300 --> 43:25.637
are we clear?

43:25.671 --> 43:27.172
Yes.
Yes.

43:27.205 --> 43:29.207
That's good.
