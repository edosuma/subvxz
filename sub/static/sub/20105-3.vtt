on my own.

12:07.185 --> 12:08.221
I don't need your help.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.479
And this should be obvious,
but I'm gonna say it anyways.

12:13.358 --> 12:16.101
Your opinion in this matter
is irrelevant.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.061
What did you
come here for, Ravi?

12:19.280 --> 12:20.487
Did you come here
to say you're sorry?

12:22.492 --> 12:25.576
Or were you hoping maybe
I'd apologize to you?

12:29.082 --> 12:30.038
(LINE RINGING)

12:30.250 --> 12:31.832
<i>- PEYTON: Hello?
- Hey.</i>

12:32.043 --> 12:32.908
Are you almost here?

12:33.127 --> 12:34.038
Yeah, I got hung up.

12:34.796 --> 12:35.661
Got it.

12:36.297 --> 12:39.665
I guess I will tread water.
See you soon.

12:44.597 --> 12:45.678
(SIGHS)

12:45.890 --> 12:47.847
Gentlemen, I am so sorry
about the delay.

12:48.059 --> 12:50.676
<i>Uh, my attorney will
be arriving tout de suite.</i>

12:50.895 --> 12:54.309
In the meantime,
can I offer you a drink, or...

12:54.732 --> 12:55.973
Snack?

12:56.192 --> 12:57.148
Nothing for me.

13:00.613 --> 13:01.854
Water.

13:03.449 --> 13:04.610
Room temperature.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.367
In a glass.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.667
So word is
you lost your memory.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.453
I did.

13:17.672 --> 13:20.005
It was the darnedest thing.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.134
I looked under all my
couch cushions, in my car...

13:24.345 --> 13:27.804
(CHUCKLES) I'm glad to see your sense
of humor made it across the Lethe.

13:28.016 --> 13:29.973
- The what?
- The Lethe.

13:30.184 --> 13:31.550
It's a river
in the land of the dead.

13:31.769 --> 13:34.386
One sip, and you just forget
who you were when you were alive.

13:34.605 --> 13:37.814
Perhaps we could get down
to the business at hand.

13:39.485 --> 13:42.694
Sorry to make everyone wait.

13:45.116 --> 13:46.573
You're supposed to be dead.

13:46.784 --> 13:50.573
And lo, the stone was
rolled away from the tomb.

13:50.788 --> 13:54.281
Blaine, um...
This man is your father.

13:57.920 --> 13:58.831
Well,

14:00.423 --> 14:02.915
I'm starting to see
the problem with the will.

14:03.760 --> 14:06.002
I'm sorry. I thought you were
abducted by the Chaos Killer.

14:06.220 --> 14:07.927
Oh, I was, but I escaped.

14:08.598 --> 14:09.588
I'm crafty.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.431
Well, hot damn!

14:12.143 --> 14:13.679
Dad's back!

14:13.895 --> 14:16.182
- Who's pumped?
- Everyone, I'm sure.

14:16.397 --> 14:19.811
Now, the will,
as I'm sure you'll agree,

14:20.026 --> 14:23.019
is no longer valid,
so if you'd just sign that...

14:23.237 --> 14:25.149
Ah, say no more.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.065
It's your money, after all.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.610
And it's a small price to pay
for this family reunion.

14:36.709 --> 14:40.953
Now, once you get back on your
feet, I think that we should...

14:41.172 --> 14:44.165
Well, geez, you tell me.

14:45.468 --> 14:46.834
What is it
we used to do together?

14:48.012 --> 14:51.005
I know I'd love to hear some
stories, look at some photos.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.682
I can tell you a story
right now if you'd like.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.312
You were 11 or so.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.353
Your mother and I
were turning the house over

15:02.568 --> 15:04.685
looking for these
earrings she loved.

15:05.446 --> 15:06.653
Then the phone rings.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.571
It's a woman we don't know.
She's very upset.

15:08.783 --> 15:11.196
She tells us that
her son's admitted

15:11.411 --> 15:15.200
that he sold my wife's
earrings in a pawn shop.

15:16.040 --> 15:21.707
You'd stolen them and roped some
teenage drug addict into selling them.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.205
So precocious!

15:27.093 --> 15:31.087
That was the day
I admitted to myself

15:31.305 --> 15:34.093
that the sight of you
made me sick.

15:36.727 --> 15:37.717
Go. Get out.

15:39.814 --> 15:40.679
Gladly.

15:43.109 --> 15:44.691
I've got what's worth having.

15:44.902 --> 15:45.813
(CLEARS THROAT)

15:57.331 --> 15:58.617
I got your text.

15:58.833 --> 15:59.949
You took a while.

16:00.168 --> 16:01.784
I was taking a sound bath.

16:02.003 --> 16:03.460
What is a...

16:03.671 --> 16:05.287
You know what? Doesn't matter.

16:05.506 --> 16:07.543
What matters is that you're
sure that this guy you ate

16:07.758 --> 16:10.501
is legitimately a
Zen'd-out, anti-materialistic,

16:10.720 --> 16:12.552
"what's the sound of one
hand clapping" kind of guy.

16:12.763 --> 16:13.844
Are you kidding?

16:14.056 --> 16:17.595
He's so legit, I don't even have to
cultivate mindful self-compassion.

16:18.853 --> 16:20.560
Then this might surprise you.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.229
He used to be
a venture capitalist.

16:26.444 --> 16:27.776
Made a fortune in software.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.229
And just days before
Topher's first big score,

16:30.448 --> 16:32.986
one of his two VC partners,
Mitch Davis,

16:33.201 --> 16:35.909
got busted trying to sell
suitcases full of cocaine.

16:36.120 --> 16:39.363
A powerful metaphor for the
spiritual baggage he had yet to shed.

16:39.582 --> 16:41.289
That metaphor
got him five years.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.708
And according to this story,

16:42.919 --> 16:46.037
Topher took on Mitch's share of the
investment and doubled his fortune.

16:46.255 --> 16:47.541
Motive!

16:47.757 --> 16:49.419
So where's this Mitch guy now,
still in jail?

16:49.634 --> 16:51.500
He got out. Two weeks ago.

16:51.719 --> 16:52.880
- Whoa.
- Mmm-hmm.

16:53.095 --> 16:54.427
I just reached out
and asked Mr. Davis

16:54.639 --> 16:56.130
to join us tomorrow
for a chat.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.261
Maybe he matches the sketch
from the homeless man.

16:58.476 --> 16:59.717
There's no sketch.

16:59.936 --> 17:02.349
Harris says he turned his back
to get the guy some coffee.

17:02.563 --> 17:03.974
Turned back, he was gone.

17:04.482 --> 17:06.269
If he was ever there
to begin with.

17:06.483 --> 17:07.724
I mean cosmically.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.685
Like how none of us
are really just here,

before they were zombie mercenaries?

I don't know, Justin.
Play villains in '80s movies?

18:04.959 --> 18:07.997
They were human mercenaries,
and before that, they were Army.

18:08.838 --> 18:10.795
The only thing that's changed
for them are the rations.

18:11.757 --> 18:12.998
You and me?

18:13.217 --> 18:15.049

zombified?

18:25.730 --> 18:27.722
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I was the DJ.

18:29.567 --> 18:31.809
Oh, that may be the saddest
thing I've ever heard.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.856
Yeah, well,
not much call for a DJ

18:34.071 --> 18:36.063

18:36.282 --> 18:39.571

named Natalie?

19:16.656 --> 19:17.737
I've heard her name.

19:17.948 --> 19:19.314
Some of my customers
ask about her.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.074
She was a call girl.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.368
You scratched her and forced
her to service your clients.

one of her old clients

is holding her
against her will.

Just a heads up. He ordered
double brains last week,

20:10.042 --> 20:12.034
so he might be on vacation.

23:34.538 --> 23:36.575
Maybe we can cross you off
the list of suspects.

23:37.374 --> 23:38.034
Why not?

23:42.004 --> 23:43.711
So you were moving product?

23:44.131 --> 23:46.168
To raise money
for a business venture.

23:46.383 --> 23:48.215
One that hit big, I might add.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.840
I found that deal, by the way.
I almost got rich.

23:51.055 --> 23:52.262
CLIVE: But you didn't.
You went to jail.

23:52.473 --> 23:53.589
And two weeks
after you get out,

23:53.807 --> 23:56.345
the man who profited off your
incarceration winds up dead.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.802
Yeah. That sucked.
But I'm over it.

24:05.527 --> 24:06.608
He's a seven and a half.

24:06.820 --> 24:08.857
Our witness said he was
tall with dark hair anyway.

24:09.073 --> 24:10.860
I'm sorry to disappoint.

24:11.075 --> 24:12.441
But my motto these days?

24:12.660 --> 24:14.401
"You've got to sell the past
and buy the future."

24:14.620 --> 24:16.202
Yet both are illusions.

24:16.413 --> 24:18.325
Like the fool,
you stare at nothing.

24:19.875 --> 24:20.831
So true.

24:21.043 --> 24:26.380
So the newspaper said Topher got
clipped in his mindfulness studio.

24:26.590 --> 24:28.331
What angle do you suppose
he was working?

24:28.550 --> 24:30.212
Topher and Devon. Buddhists?

24:30.427 --> 24:32.214
(CHUCKLING) Please.

24:32.429 --> 24:33.419
I'm sorry.

24:34.890 --> 24:35.971
Who's Devon?

24:36.517 --> 24:37.974
Uncurl the toes, please.

24:40.562 --> 24:41.552
Twelve.

24:45.234 --> 24:46.065
Open wide.

24:53.242 --> 24:54.824
So Mitch went to jail,

24:55.035 --> 24:57.869
and you and Topher
struck it rich. What then?

24:58.080 --> 25:00.948
I couldn't understand why I
wasn't happy, so I spent my money.

25:01.166 --> 25:04.876
Hoping things, material
possessions, hallucinogenics,

25:05.087 --> 25:06.953
would bring me peace.
They didn't.

25:07.172 --> 25:10.256
So after you spent all your money,
Topher got you into all this?

25:10.467 --> 25:11.674
The other way around.

25:11.885 --> 25:14.343
After I hit rock bottom,
I discovered mindfulness.

25:14.555 --> 25:17.548
Topher saw how my life
improved and it inspired him.

25:20.769 --> 25:22.010
These look familiar?

25:23.188 --> 25:24.395
Yes. They're mine.

25:24.982 --> 25:26.598
- You're sure?
- The two-tone laces.

25:26.817 --> 25:28.524
Absolutely.
Where did they turn up?

25:30.029 --> 25:33.898
They were found in a dumpster a
block over, covered in Topher's blood.

25:34.700 --> 25:37.443
You know, a few nights
before Topher's murder,

25:37.661 --> 25:38.617
I walked into my home,

25:38.829 --> 25:41.242
and I had the sense
that someone had broken in.

25:41.749 --> 25:42.614
"The sense"?

25:43.000 --> 25:46.493
The positive energy had
been completely obstructed.

25:47.546 --> 25:48.878
I know how that sounds.

25:50.132 --> 25:50.872
Ladybird.

25:51.842 --> 25:54.209
You remember what I said about
my house a few nights ago?

25:54.928 --> 25:57.170
You mean when your positive
energy was obstructed?

25:58.348 --> 25:59.839
That's not a thing.

You're doing it right now.

26:03.187 --> 26:04.143
Give us a second.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.436
There is no way it's him.

26:09.902 --> 26:13.737
He just admitted these shoes splattered
with the victim's blood are his.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.071
We know the murderer
wore those shoes.

26:16.283 --> 26:17.945
So this whole Zen thing's
an act?

26:19.745 --> 26:20.610
Look at him.

26:22.664 --> 26:24.075
We need our homeless guy.

26:24.625 --> 26:26.787
Do a line-up,
see if he ID's him.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.751
We know he lives nearby.

in her digestive tract.

before she got on that plane.

No idea.

where all the people died.

27:12.756 --> 27:14.713
but I was down
the food chain a bit.

in their stomachs.

connection between the two massacres?

anything's possible, but...

the boat party, didn't you?

I did. Several.

And?

27:38.949 --> 27:39.735
And...

27:39.950 --> 27:42.488

in their digestive systems?

sleeps in this alley.

When I'm dying,
I'm going to take the cure.

35:47.979 --> 35:51.143
Then, when my memories start
fading, I'm going to take the serum.

35:51.983 --> 35:56.569
See, 'cause I'm going to want
to remember my old life.

35:58.239 --> 35:59.605
I understand why you may not.

36:01.409 --> 36:05.198
A fundamentally decent person
would realize you owe him.

36:05.413 --> 36:07.245
- Ravi!
- LIV: Let's take a breath.

36:07.457 --> 36:10.200
Try to visualize ourselves
in one another's shoes.

36:11.586 --> 36:12.417
Okay.

36:12.879 --> 36:13.869
I'll try that.

36:14.089 --> 36:15.876
(CLEARS THROAT) I'm Blaine.

36:16.091 --> 36:17.957
I killed people for money.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.418
- That's not what I...
- I tortured you.

36:20.637 --> 36:22.924
- I literally killed you.
- Ravi, enough!

36:23.139 --> 36:26.928
- Open your eyes, Peyton!
- Oh, my eyes are wide open.

36:27.268 --> 36:28.679
Why are you being such a dick?

36:28.895 --> 36:30.136
It isn't obvious?

36:32.315 --> 36:33.772
It's because
I'm in love with you.

36:44.160 --> 36:45.276
I'll do it.

36:48.164 --> 36:49.280
Shoot me up, Doc.

36:50.792 --> 36:51.498
Thank you.

36:54.587 --> 36:56.078
You don't have to do this.

36:57.590 --> 36:58.626
I know.

37:09.811 --> 37:10.892
Do it.

37:21.573 --> 37:26.659
Be you zombie,
or be you man?

37:26.870 --> 37:28.236
Just get on with it.

37:29.956 --> 37:32.699
Ghost pepper, 500 times
spicier than straight jalapeño.

37:32.917 --> 37:34.783
A human bites into that,
the whole block'll know.

37:38.089 --> 37:39.079
Sold.

37:41.509 --> 37:43.341
Lots of weird-ass peppers.

37:43.553 --> 37:45.636
We can do
tasting flights and...

37:47.432 --> 37:48.468
Oh.

37:49.267 --> 37:50.257
Hey.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.184
This our new muscle?

37:56.399 --> 37:58.356
I wouldn't say ours.

37:58.568 --> 38:01.311
The club will offer brains
of one's choosing.

38:02.906 --> 38:03.566
For a price.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.364
Dino's specialty
is acquisitions.

38:06.868 --> 38:07.824
Dope.

38:09.370 --> 38:11.987
As for our
establishment's name,

38:12.207 --> 38:16.292
I give you
the Scratching Post.

38:17.962 --> 38:18.952
So?

38:19.923 --> 38:21.004
That'll do, pig.

38:23.134 --> 38:25.376
What about our customers
who aren't crazy rich?

38:25.595 --> 38:28.713
'Cause I've got to say,
having Dino here whack a guy

38:28.932 --> 38:32.346
every time you want lunch
is super one-percent.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.017
For our less
high-end clientele,

38:34.229 --> 38:36.642
I bought a hospital
in Bangladesh.

38:36.856 --> 38:38.893
It has one of highest
mortality rates in the world.

38:39.901 --> 38:42.234
- Love it.
- Shipments will be arriving weekly.

38:42.445 --> 38:43.526
So I figure, next week,

38:43.738 --> 38:45.229
I'll approach
Blaine's customers,

38:45.448 --> 38:48.111
let them know
there's a new supplier,

38:48.326 --> 38:50.613
a new club, new ladies...

38:50.829 --> 38:51.910
No.

38:52.121 --> 38:53.077
- No...
- No.

38:53.289 --> 38:56.157
Let's get up and running,
work the kinks out first.

38:56.835 --> 38:58.326
We don't have
any customers yet.

38:58.545 --> 39:00.832
Make some then. Go to clubs.

39:01.047 --> 39:03.380
Find those dimwits paying $500
for bottle service.

39:03.591 --> 39:06.004
Do like our name says
and scratch them.

39:06.219 --> 39:07.926
- Sweet.
- (LAUGHS)

39:08.137 --> 39:09.924
You bet your ass, it's sweet.

39:10.139 --> 39:13.598
Now run out and grab me an
espresso while I tackle decor.

39:14.310 --> 39:15.426
Why can't the big guy do it?

39:15.645 --> 39:18.183
Dino suffers from
small-fiber neuropathy.

39:20.316 --> 39:21.477
His feet hurt.

39:23.319 --> 39:24.526
Ice-blended.

39:25.864 --> 39:26.729
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

39:34.664 --> 39:36.326
- Hey.
- You love me?

39:37.750 --> 39:38.581
I do.

39:38.793 --> 39:40.659
Then why have you been
so awful to me?

39:40.879 --> 39:42.336
Why haven't you
been there for me?

39:43.381 --> 39:45.919
I was held at gunpoint, Ravi.
I thought I was going to die,

39:46.134 --> 39:47.670
and yet somehow
you've made this about you,

39:47.886 --> 39:49.923
about your pride,
about your jealousy.

39:50.889 --> 39:55.600
I know.
And I'm... I'm so sorry.

39:57.145 --> 39:59.478
Pride. I'm done with it.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.856
Look, it's only been
a liability.

40:03.067 --> 40:05.775
I was so excited
that we were back together.

40:06.529 --> 40:07.610
So was I.

40:10.533 --> 40:11.364
Are you drunk?

40:12.827 --> 40:13.863
Like, a little.

40:16.205 --> 40:17.412
Don't you get it?

40:17.624 --> 40:20.287
The one thing that's stopping
this from happening is you.

40:21.294 --> 40:22.705
Understood.

40:22.921 --> 40:25.914
Then... Then I am...
I am officially stopping...

40:26.132 --> 40:28.499
I'm stopping this from

40:30.303 --> 40:31.339
stopping.

40:32.847 --> 40:33.963
Screw it.

40:46.736 --> 40:47.943
(GLASS SHATTERS)

40:51.866 --> 40:53.357
Is there someone here?

40:54.535 --> 40:56.276
Wait, Peyton, please.

41:02.543 --> 41:03.659
Oopsie.

41:04.963 --> 41:07.205
The way we left things,
I didn't think you...

41:07.423 --> 41:08.083
Don't!

41:12.845 --> 41:14.052
(DOOR SLAMS SHUT)

41:14.263 --> 41:15.253
