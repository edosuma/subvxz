I think the last time we were
sitting here in this apartment,

35:33.448 --> 35:34.539
I was feeling
kind of overwhelmed

35:34.691 --> 35:37.116
With, like, the relationship.

35:37.136 --> 35:40.286
We would get in disagreements,
but then

35:40.305 --> 35:41.696
No time to, like, process it,

35:41.789 --> 35:45.049
No time
to resolve those things.

35:45.202 --> 35:48.461
- Mm-hmm.
- And now, it just--

35:48.480 --> 35:49.888
Some things don't matter to me

35:49.982 --> 35:51.982
As much as I thought they did
in the moment.

35:52.133 --> 35:55.210
And some things are worth,
like, compromising on, right?

35:55.228 --> 35:56.486
- [clears throat]

35:56.713 --> 35:58.137
Some of this,
I think just kind of--

35:58.157 --> 36:01.992
Because this is so accelerated,
things just surface

36:02.143 --> 36:05.811
That wouldn't normally surface
so quickly, I think.

36:05.831 --> 36:08.165
- And that's a lot
of what I reflected on.

36:08.316 --> 36:11.409
In a normal relationship,
by date two or three,

36:11.561 --> 36:13.152
If we had that many arguments,

36:13.172 --> 36:16.339
I would have already said,
we are not meant to date.

36:16.566 --> 36:18.583
[laughs]

36:18.735 --> 36:22.420
But because experts matched us
for a reason,

36:22.514 --> 36:25.907
I feel like, at some point
over the next two months,

36:25.926 --> 36:29.411
We're gonna grow to find out
we have so much in common

36:29.429 --> 36:32.838

complement one another.

36:32.858 --> 36:34.357
