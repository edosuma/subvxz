00:06.063 --> 00:07.894
- Good evening, Liz.
- Hi, Dan.

00:08.632 --> 00:11.032
Saw you on the Perry Como special.

00:11.201 --> 00:13.192
Great.

00:16.740 --> 00:19.140
Hey, Carla B.,
how'd you like to see a trick?

00:19.309 --> 00:21.903
Sorry. It's my night off.

00:23.781 --> 00:26.341
Your Honor, we're ready to begin.

00:26.518 --> 00:29.487
I hold in my hand
an ordinary magic ball.

00:29.654 --> 00:33.385
I hold in my hand a caseload
that would choke a horse.

00:34.158 --> 00:37.491
- I put the ball in my hand like this.
- Yeah, we're really busy tonight...

00:37.662 --> 00:40.153
Now, watch.
Now, I shuffle up my hands.

00:40.331 --> 00:41.923
- I got a little headache too.
- Yeah.

00:42.100 --> 00:44.625
And then, you gotta guess
which hand is the ball in.

00:44.802 --> 00:46.827
- Your Honor, we're all set.
- Fine.

00:47.472 --> 00:49.167
- Which hand?
- Your Honor, I don't...

00:49.340 --> 00:53.504
Please guess, or we'll all grow
old and die here.

00:56.815 --> 00:58.476
- This one.
- Wrong.

00:59.051 --> 01:02.418
I can see it, you know,
kind of in between your fingers there.

01:02.588 --> 01:04.488
- Damn.
- We didn't see anything.

01:04.657 --> 01:07.353
- I didn't see it. It was perfect.
- I didn't see it.

01:07.927 --> 01:11.795
- Shall I call the first case, Your Honor?
- Ready when you are, CB.

01:16.268 --> 01:19.533
- Dan, it wasn't that funny.
- I know.

01:19.705 --> 01:22.037
- Bull.
- Right.

01:25.477 --> 01:28.503
Well, I think this fellow needs
no introduction.

01:28.681 --> 01:31.708
- Thanks, Harry.
- You remembered.

01:31.885 --> 01:34.445
- Anything else, Your Honor?
- No, thanks, Bull.

01:34.621 --> 01:37.021
- I was just doing my job.
- Oh, that's all right, son.

01:37.190 --> 01:40.819
Don't worry, and thanks again
for the nice letter.

01:42.329 --> 01:45.594
- Yeah.
- A John Doe, Your Honor.

01:45.765 --> 01:48.666
He refuses to give any other name
other than Santa Claus.

01:48.835 --> 01:50.996
The police are still checking
his fingerprints.

01:51.171 --> 01:53.196
- What's the charge?
- Trespassing, Your Honor.

01:53.373 --> 01:55.603
Security guards
at Redfield's department store...

01:55.775 --> 01:59.108
...found him and a couple of other
derelicts sleeping there after hours.

01:59.279 --> 02:03.079
Your Honor, I object to the prosecution
referring to my client as "derelict."

02:03.249 --> 02:08.711
All Santa had in his bag was a box
of Chiclets and a half-empty bottle of gin.

02:08.889 --> 02:12.552
Firing up the old yule log, eh, Mr. Claus?

02:13.294 --> 02:15.125
Well, sure, I had a couple of blasts.

02:15.296 --> 02:18.595
Always takes me a couple of weeks
to wind down after Christmas.

02:18.766 --> 02:22.133
But then, come March,
I'm back to work already.

02:22.303 --> 02:27.263
Production meetings,
toy conventions, zip codes to update.

02:27.875 --> 02:31.470
What's the matter? Can't your
little elves take some of the load off?

02:31.646 --> 02:35.605
Danny, there was some messy little
business with a doll when you were eight.

02:35.783 --> 02:38.446
Don't make me bring it up.

02:39.021 --> 02:40.249
Mr. Claus.

02:40.422 --> 02:42.014
Mr. Claus.

02:42.190 --> 02:46.092
I want you to know that when it comes
to fantasies, legends, myths...

02:46.261 --> 02:49.560
...I don't think there's anyone
in the world who believes more than I.

02:49.731 --> 02:51.164
Right, Mr. Fielding?

02:51.333 --> 02:53.699
You're a mythical kind of guy,
Your Honor.

02:53.869 --> 02:55.996
Right, but I'm also a judge.

02:56.171 --> 02:59.868
And as a judge, I think we could settle
this matter quickly and equitably...

03:00.042 --> 03:02.272
...if you would just give us
your real name.

03:02.444 --> 03:05.208
- Elizabeth.
- He's right. It would be easier.

03:05.380 --> 03:06.779
You're my defense attorney.

03:06.948 --> 03:11.180
- Don't you believe that I'm Santa Claus?
- Oh, I do. I mean, I would like to.

03:11.354 --> 03:15.120
- I really would.
- We all would. Believe me.

03:15.291 --> 03:20.126
But unfortunately that is part
of the price we paid for growing up.

03:20.296 --> 03:23.322
- The prisoner's status sheet, Your Honor.
- Thank you.

03:23.499 --> 03:25.296
Hi.

03:26.402 --> 03:28.427
- Hi.
- I'm Santa Claus.

03:28.604 --> 03:31.698
I'm the Easter Bunny. We'll have lunch.

03:33.000 --> 03:39.074

04:15.152 --> 04:20.147
And believe me, boy,
Rudolph didn't like that one little bit.

04:21.993 --> 04:23.358
That's funny.

04:23.762 --> 04:26.458
Carla B., right?

04:26.965 --> 04:32.904
It's a fine line between
naughty and nice, isn't it?

04:33.438 --> 04:35.030
That's quite a group of admirers...

04:35.206 --> 04:36.696
...Santa has over there.
- Yeah.

04:36.875 --> 04:40.902
- Any more from the police on his identity?
- Not yet.

04:41.079 --> 04:42.876
He's a cute old guy though, isn't he?

04:43.047 --> 04:46.414
A right, jolly old elf, almost.

04:47.085 --> 04:50.054
It's funny, isn't it, how he seems
to know all of our names.

04:50.221 --> 04:51.449
Yeah, it is.

04:51.623 --> 04:53.216
- There are nameplates.
- Yeah, but...

04:53.392 --> 04:54.723
- And badges.
- Sure. However...

04:54.894 --> 04:56.987
Our names are published
in the daily calendar.

04:57.163 --> 04:58.630
Okay, okay.

04:58.898 --> 05:00.661
One more case before lunch,
Your Honor.

05:00.833 --> 05:03.927
- Well, then let's roll.
- Okay. Bring the kids in.

05:08.974 --> 05:11.943
- What have we got here?
- More unknowns I'm afraid, Your Honor.

05:12.111 --> 05:15.603
They were picked up for shoplifting
and refuse to give their names.

05:15.781 --> 05:17.373
Probably runaways.

05:18.117 --> 05:20.779
Hi. I'm Judge Stone. And you're?

05:20.953 --> 05:22.818
Batman.

05:24.323 --> 05:26.986
This is my old lady, Wonder Woman.

05:27.727 --> 05:30.787
Permission to smack him
around a little, Your Honor.

05:33.400 --> 05:37.666
Denied, but the court sympathizes,
Mr. Prosecutor. What's the story?

05:37.838 --> 05:41.035
They were apprehended leaving
a grocery store with unpurchased items.

05:41.208 --> 05:46.840
He had a streusel in his pants,
and she had a blouse full of Fritos.

05:47.981 --> 05:50.779
Never occurred to you
to steal an entrée, huh?

05:50.951 --> 05:53.215
- Look, spare us the lectures, okay?
- Eddie.

05:53.386 --> 05:57.789
- What did I tell you about the name stuff?
- That's all I'm gonna tell him. Don't worry.

05:57.958 --> 06:01.395
- Eddie. Eddie what?
- Cleaver.

06:01.562 --> 06:04.725
Perhaps you know my brothers,
Wally and the Beav.

06:06.200 --> 06:09.226
Just a few minutes alone with him.
That's all.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.234
What is your name, young lady?

06:12.840 --> 06:16.298
- Mary.
- Enough with the names already.

06:16.477 --> 06:20.174
Just tell us your full names and where
you live, so we can contact your parents.

06:20.882 --> 06:23.407
Our parents don't care any more
about us than you do...

06:23.584 --> 06:25.916
...so why don't we quit
wasting time and get on...

06:26.087 --> 06:29.454
Young man, you're in court,
and that's no way to talk to a judge.

06:29.624 --> 06:31.023
Eddie's right.

06:31.192 --> 06:34.185
Nobody cares about us except us...

06:34.363 --> 06:36.695
...and that's why we're getting married.

06:38.233 --> 06:41.259
You look a little young
to be getting married.

06:41.436 --> 06:44.564
You look a little young to be a judge.

06:46.108 --> 06:49.942
- Touché, you little...
- Your Honor.

06:50.679 --> 06:53.079
The juvenile authorities
have been notified.

06:53.248 --> 06:55.716
I suggest we remand them over
to them for disposition.

06:55.884 --> 06:59.217
- Mr. Prosecutor.
- Uncle Dan has no objections.

07:00.923 --> 07:03.551
Fine. Then it is so ordered.

07:04.626 --> 07:06.491
Okay, you two.

07:07.730 --> 07:09.994
<i>Have you ever seen The Munsters?</i>

07:11.267 --> 07:14.862
That's right. Egg him on.

07:16.639 --> 07:18.539
That's dinner, everybody.

07:20.209 --> 07:22.302
You see, in Holland...

07:22.478 --> 07:24.639
...I leave the presents
in the children's shoes.

07:24.814 --> 07:28.375
- Well, there was this one kid...
- Hey. Hey, Santa Claus.

07:28.551 --> 07:31.577
Why don't you tell us what it's like
up in the North Pole there.

07:31.754 --> 07:36.453
Bet you freeze your
sleigh bells off at night, right?

07:36.626 --> 07:38.651
- He's a worm.
- He's a kid.

07:38.828 --> 07:40.352
Someday he'll grow up.

07:40.530 --> 07:43.261
And be a large worm.

07:45.002 --> 07:48.438
Why are you so angry, young man?

07:48.973 --> 07:51.305
Me? I ain't angry.

07:51.475 --> 07:54.911
- Am I, sweetheart?
- Not to me you're not.

07:55.946 --> 07:58.141
What do you want me to do, gramps?

07:58.315 --> 08:00.977
Climb on your knee and tell you
what I want for Christmas?

08:01.151 --> 08:02.413
If you'd like.

08:03.454 --> 08:04.785
If I'd like?

08:04.955 --> 08:07.014
Hey, somebody get this
twinkie away from me.

08:07.191 --> 08:09.284
Hey! That'll be enough out of you.

08:09.460 --> 08:12.987
This is my courtroom and you
will treat people with respect.

08:13.163 --> 08:15.155
This nut thinks he's Santa Claus.

08:15.333 --> 08:17.233
Well, how do you know he isn't?

08:17.402 --> 08:20.269
<i>I think I've seen this on
The Twilight Zone.</i>

08:20.572 --> 08:22.938
Kids, maybe we got off
on the wrong foot earlier.

08:23.108 --> 08:25.508
You wanna have some fun?
Here. Here's a magic ball.

08:25.677 --> 08:30.910
Now, I put it in my hand,
and then I get some magic powder...

08:31.616 --> 08:33.777
...then I sprinkle it on the ball
and it's gone.

08:33.952 --> 08:36.284
Where'd the ball go?

08:38.823 --> 08:40.188
In your pocket.

08:41.393 --> 08:43.554
In your ear.

08:43.727 --> 08:46.891
Oh, judge, don't get angry at him.
He's not a bad boy.

08:47.065 --> 08:49.626
He's just a little frustrated,
that's all. Believe me...

08:49.802 --> 08:52.965
...l've seen it a million times before.

08:53.506 --> 08:57.909
Eddie, is he really Santa Claus?

08:58.077 --> 09:01.740
Oh, sure he is. Look, look.
He's got a red suit. He's got a beard.

09:01.914 --> 09:03.347
You need more proof than that?

09:03.516 --> 09:05.984
You know, it's all right
for you not to believe in me.

09:06.152 --> 09:12.318
It really is, because the important
thing is that I believe in you.

09:12.758 --> 09:16.694
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Well, it means I care.

09:16.862 --> 09:18.853
That's all.

09:19.031 --> 09:21.090
Oh, sure. How comforting!

09:21.600 --> 09:24.092
I can smell the booze on you from here.

09:24.638 --> 09:26.663
What am I supposed to do?
Jump up and down...

09:26.840 --> 09:29.502
...because some wino
in a red suit tells me he cares?

09:29.676 --> 09:32.372
- I do care!
- Maybe a game of charades would be fun.

09:32.546 --> 09:34.639
You can laugh at me all you want.

09:34.815 --> 09:38.080
All of you disbelievers
can laugh all you want!

09:38.251 --> 09:40.947
But don't tell me I don't care!

09:41.121 --> 09:44.887
Don't anybody ever tell me
I don't care!

09:45.926 --> 09:50.295
- What happened?
- Get back, people. Give him some air.

09:50.464 --> 09:52.625
It's all right. I'll be...

09:52.799 --> 09:54.994
I'll be fine.

09:56.304 --> 10:00.104
Listen, if I don't make it, tell...

10:01.075 --> 10:04.306
Tell Frosty goodbye.

10:06.214 --> 10:09.149
I'm just kidding. Get a doctor.

10:15.256 --> 10:17.156
Well.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.725
Just let him rest awhile
and he should be all right.

10:19.894 --> 10:23.125
This kind of heart condition,
there's not much more you can do.

10:23.297 --> 10:25.094
- I told him.
- I'm sorry.

10:25.266 --> 10:28.292
It just sounds better coming
from him. Thanks, doc.

10:28.469 --> 10:31.200
- I'm glad you were in the building.
- Glad I could help.

10:31.373 --> 10:33.500
Take care, Santa.

10:33.675 --> 10:34.972
Say...

10:35.144 --> 10:38.079
...do you like that new putter
your wife got you for Christmas?

10:39.882 --> 10:41.782
Oh, yeah. It's great.

10:41.950 --> 10:43.918
Thanks.

10:48.056 --> 10:50.547
Now do you believe me, young man?

10:50.726 --> 10:53.889
He's a doctor. What else
is he gonna get for Christmas?

10:54.429 --> 10:55.919
Harry...

10:56.732 --> 10:59.428
...you know who I am now.

10:59.601 --> 11:01.432
Don't you?

11:05.074 --> 11:06.939
Let me show you a trick
with a red ball.

11:07.110 --> 11:08.702
Harry...

11:08.878 --> 11:12.006
...I am Santa Claus.

11:13.950 --> 11:17.579
- Okay. Okay, you're Santa Claus.
- No, I mean, the one...

11:17.754 --> 11:22.123
...the only, the true Santa Claus.

11:22.692 --> 11:26.992
If you mean the personification
of the spirit of Christmas...

11:27.163 --> 11:30.894
...then, yeah. I think you
and a couple of others do fit the bill.

11:31.067 --> 11:34.696
Now you're on the right track,
only there are no others.

11:34.871 --> 11:38.399
There's only one at a time,
and when his time has passed...

11:38.576 --> 11:41.909
...like mine almost is...

11:42.513 --> 11:45.311
...he passes it on.

11:46.617 --> 11:48.710
He passes what on?

11:48.886 --> 11:52.185
The power, the spirit.

11:52.356 --> 11:54.347
The door.

11:59.129 --> 12:01.689
- How is he?
- Spooky.

12:02.466 --> 12:05.867
Did I mention the ability to hear
the slightest sounds and read thoughts?

12:06.036 --> 12:08.869
No, you hadn't gotten to that part yet.

12:09.039 --> 12:10.530
Okay.

12:10.709 --> 12:13.303
What's going on?
What are you two talking about?

12:13.478 --> 12:17.278
I was telling the judge
about my search for a...

12:17.449 --> 12:19.440
...replacement.

12:19.618 --> 12:22.109
Replacement for what?

12:22.287 --> 12:24.016
- Harry.
- Right.

12:24.189 --> 12:27.056
You read minds. I forgot.

12:28.460 --> 12:30.257
Hey, you.

12:35.533 --> 12:38.058
Hey, me?

12:38.503 --> 12:40.164
Yeah.

12:40.338 --> 12:43.034
- How's the old man doing?
- I don't know.

12:43.508 --> 12:46.842
Sure, he's nuts and all, but I didn't
mean him no harm or nothing.

12:47.013 --> 12:49.243
No, of course not.

12:49.415 --> 12:53.749
Mister, what do you think we are,
animals or something?

12:53.919 --> 12:57.616
I have no proof,
if that's what you mean.

13:01.627 --> 13:04.357
Wanna have some fun?

13:05.431 --> 13:09.765
Go and tease Bull about his hair.

13:12.772 --> 13:15.502
He loves it, really.

13:20.047 --> 13:22.743
Your Honor, we got the identification
on the two runaways.

13:22.916 --> 13:26.181
- Police just sent this over.
- Well, there's one mystery unraveled.

13:26.353 --> 13:28.651
- Selma, go ask Bull to bring the kids in.
- Right.

13:28.822 --> 13:31.347
- There you go.
- Harry, may I have that?

13:31.525 --> 13:33.789
- Why?
- I just thought, you see...

13:33.960 --> 13:37.225
...if those kids don't know
about that report...

13:37.397 --> 13:41.834
...and I still manage
to know their identities...

13:42.002 --> 13:43.993
Then they might believe
in Santa Claus.

13:44.171 --> 13:46.901
They might believe in something.
That'd be a start.

13:47.074 --> 13:49.474
And it'd make a sick,
old man happy.

13:49.643 --> 13:54.047
Come on, judge. Just to see the look
on their faces would be worth it.

13:54.215 --> 13:57.412
Oh, come on, Harry. It'll be so cute.

13:58.586 --> 14:01.749
Cute? Gee willikers, I'm all for it.

14:05.593 --> 14:07.322
Here you go, Your Honor.

14:07.862 --> 14:12.629
- What's going on here?
- Is this where we get the rubber hoses?

14:12.800 --> 14:15.894
I told you I was just kidding about that.

14:16.838 --> 14:18.965
We thought we'd give
you kids another chance...

14:19.140 --> 14:22.132
...to give us your full names
and tell us where you live.

14:22.310 --> 14:23.572
No way.

14:23.745 --> 14:26.909
Like we said, our parents
couldn't care less where we are.

14:27.082 --> 14:28.549
That's not true...

14:28.717 --> 14:31.242
...Mary Elaine Montgomery.

14:33.088 --> 14:35.989
- How did you know my name?
- A lot of things I know about you.

14:36.158 --> 14:39.355
For example, I know
that your mom and dad...

14:39.528 --> 14:41.519
...Art and Celeste...

14:41.697 --> 14:44.689
...miss you very much
and want you back home.

14:44.867 --> 14:46.494
- You told him.
- I did not.

14:46.668 --> 14:50.297
She didn't say a word, Eddie Simms.

14:51.106 --> 14:53.973
- You know who I am?
- 3rd and 84th, apartment 6C.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.611
That Eddie Simms.

14:56.779 --> 15:00.216
Yeah. Well, if you know that,
then you know the people who live there...

15:00.383 --> 15:03.944
...and call themselves my parents
don't give a damn if I come home or not.

15:04.120 --> 15:07.954
Eddie, I know it appears that way
right now, but believe me...

15:08.124 --> 15:09.455
...it's not true.

15:09.626 --> 15:11.890
- Yeah? How do you know?
- How did I know your name?

15:12.061 --> 15:13.824
How did I know your address?

15:13.997 --> 15:17.262
How do I know the names and addresses
of every man, woman and child...

15:17.434 --> 15:18.992
...in the whole world?

15:19.169 --> 15:24.971
How do I know that
your secret desire is to be loved...

15:25.141 --> 15:26.870
...to be hugged...

15:27.043 --> 15:28.670
...to be held...

15:28.845 --> 15:30.369
...to be cared for?

15:32.483 --> 15:34.417
That's crazy.

15:34.919 --> 15:36.682
It's true, Eddie.

15:36.854 --> 15:38.549
You know it.

15:39.123 --> 15:40.852
You told me.

15:41.025 --> 15:44.483
Yeah, well, what if it is?
How do you know all that anyway?

15:44.662 --> 15:48.120
How do you know what goes on
in other people's heads?

15:48.666 --> 15:50.725
Because I'm Santa Claus.

15:54.171 --> 15:58.198
- Judge Harold T. Stone?
- I'm Judge Stone.

15:58.375 --> 16:01.071
Dr. Peter Green,
Winwood Psychiatric Center.

16:01.245 --> 16:03.941
- The police told me I'd find John here.
- John?

16:04.114 --> 16:07.107
John Stevens,
the man in the red flannel suit.

16:07.853 --> 16:10.344
Oh, that John Stevens.

16:10.522 --> 16:14.583
- Dr. Green, what a surprise.
- Hello, John.

16:14.759 --> 16:18.058
I feel fortunate. We usually don't
catch him this soon after Christmas.

16:18.230 --> 16:19.561
- You don't?
- No, every year...

16:19.731 --> 16:22.222
...he disappears just before Christmas.

16:22.400 --> 16:26.063
Usually manages to elude us
till about the first of February.

16:26.238 --> 16:29.537
- You mean this guy's a fruitcake?
- Bull.

16:29.708 --> 16:32.404
I'm sorry. Alleged fruitcake?

16:34.179 --> 16:37.376
Well, what do you know?

16:37.549 --> 16:40.542
Another adult who lies about things.

16:40.720 --> 16:44.451
- My, my, Santa, am I ever surprised.
- Eddie, don't. He's sick.

16:44.624 --> 16:46.285
I know he's sick!

16:46.459 --> 16:48.427
I'm sick too.

16:48.594 --> 16:51.586
- You wanna hear something crazy?
- It's my job.

16:53.866 --> 16:56.630
I actually started listening
to this old coot.

16:56.802 --> 16:58.827
For a minute there,
I actually believed him.

16:59.005 --> 17:01.405
Me, Eddie Simms,
actually believed in Santa Claus.

17:01.574 --> 17:03.769
- Eddie...
- You're a phony, old man.

17:03.943 --> 17:05.569
You're a fake.

17:05.744 --> 17:08.441
Other people just tell lies.
You live them.

17:11.517 --> 17:13.144
You apologize to him.

17:13.319 --> 17:15.288
- What?
- I said, apologize to him!

17:15.454 --> 17:17.616
- For what?!
- Are you that stupid?

17:17.790 --> 17:20.259
I ain't saying nothing
without my attorney present.

17:20.426 --> 17:22.258
She's here.

17:23.363 --> 17:25.887
Tell him if you're stupid or not.

17:27.134 --> 17:28.658
That man cares for you, Eddie.

17:29.069 --> 17:32.004
He cares enough to take the time,
to risk his health...

17:32.172 --> 17:35.733
...to risk ridicule just to show you that.

17:35.909 --> 17:38.309
- Yeah, well, nobody asked him.
- Feels good, don't it?

17:38.478 --> 17:40.412
Not having to ask?

17:40.581 --> 17:42.708
What do you want?
You want me to say thank you?

17:42.883 --> 17:46.148
Okay, fine. Thank you, Santa.
Thank you. Thanks for caring.

17:46.320 --> 17:50.451
- Sorry, it didn't work out. Maybe next year.
- What's the point?

17:50.625 --> 17:52.217
Remember...

17:52.393 --> 17:54.156
Remember when you were 5...

17:54.329 --> 17:57.389
...and you were sick, and your mom
had to hold you down...

17:57.565 --> 18:00.033
...to get the medicine in?

18:04.539 --> 18:07.269
Okay, you thick-skulled,
empty-headed little creep.

18:07.442 --> 18:11.435
He cares for you.
Mary cares for you. I care for you.

18:11.613 --> 18:16.312
You are in the middle of a room
full of people that care for you.

18:16.484 --> 18:19.180
- Bull.
- Yeah?

18:20.856 --> 18:24.087
You know, I am sick of hearing
how everybody cares for me.

18:24.259 --> 18:26.955
I am sick of hearing the word "care"!

18:27.129 --> 18:30.587
It is just talk!
That's all it is! It's just talk.

18:30.766 --> 18:33.132
- Just talk! What are you doing?
- Come here.

18:33.302 --> 18:35.600
- Let me go!
- Stop squirming.

18:35.771 --> 18:37.966
- What are you doing?
- I'm hugging you, dummy.

18:38.140 --> 18:41.007
- Let go of me. Stop. Please, stop it.
- Shut up.

18:41.176 --> 18:43.440
- Shut up.
- Please.

18:43.612 --> 18:45.671
Shut up.

18:50.786 --> 18:53.550
I don't understand what happened.

18:54.724 --> 18:57.215
- Transference.
- What?

18:57.394 --> 19:00.420
The object of the patient's anger
is transferred to the analyst...

19:00.597 --> 19:03.760
...which creates a cathartic condition
as well as fertile ground...

19:03.933 --> 19:07.460
...for ratiocination and self-communion.

19:07.637 --> 19:09.264
Yeah.

19:10.206 --> 19:12.367
That's what I thought.

19:15.345 --> 19:17.370
I'm sorry for crinkling your robe.

19:17.547 --> 19:20.448
Hey, two minutes in a dryer,
good as new.

19:24.387 --> 19:28.085
- Eddie, are you all right?
- Yeah.

19:28.259 --> 19:29.658
Yeah, I'm okay.

19:29.827 --> 19:32.352
I feel a little stupid.

19:32.997 --> 19:36.160
And better. Please, no more rough stuff.

19:37.768 --> 19:40.566
Come on, John. Let's go.
I've got a car waiting.

19:40.738 --> 19:42.603
This'll show my right
to guardianship...

19:42.773 --> 19:44.798
...in case of any question
about the charges.

19:44.975 --> 19:47.739
I'll remand him into your
custody now, doctor.

19:47.912 --> 19:50.710
I'm sure the charges will be dropped
under the circumstances.

19:50.881 --> 19:52.348
Ready, John?

19:55.019 --> 19:58.182
- Goodbye, Harry.
- Goodbye.

19:59.190 --> 20:03.025
You really believe
you're Santa Claus, don't you?

20:04.329 --> 20:07.127
Oh, I believe this is yours, isn't it?

20:10.235 --> 20:12.430
- Lana.
- A pleasure.

20:12.604 --> 20:14.265
Bull.

20:15.307 --> 20:17.207
Thank you, Elizabeth.

20:17.375 --> 20:18.842
Hey...

20:19.010 --> 20:22.343
...about what I said before.
- Oh, don't worry.

20:22.514 --> 20:25.176
I didn't believe you either.

20:29.387 --> 20:31.184
Wait a minute.

20:31.356 --> 20:34.621
How did you know our names
and where we lived and all that other stuff?

20:34.793 --> 20:39.197
We got a report from the police
missing persons department.

20:39.365 --> 20:41.356
It arrived before you got here.

20:41.534 --> 20:43.229
See.

20:43.903 --> 20:48.602
"Missing since Friday,
Ben Kurasawa, age 13...

20:48.775 --> 20:51.938
...and Nancy Tanaka, age 12."

20:52.111 --> 20:55.274
Harry, about my proposition...

20:56.682 --> 20:58.843
Think it over.

21:17.371 --> 21:21.307
More banana brandy, anyone?

21:22.309 --> 21:25.642
It came in that Christmas basket
with the stuff you've been munching on.

21:25.813 --> 21:29.078
The candied oysters were good.

21:31.451 --> 21:35.285
- Strange day, huh?
- Yeah.

21:35.789 --> 21:39.316
I'm sure there must
be an explanation for everything.

21:39.493 --> 21:41.427
Oh, I'm sure there must be.

21:41.595 --> 21:43.530
Like what?

21:44.032 --> 21:46.523
He overheard some policemen
talking, perhaps.

21:47.235 --> 21:48.463
Yeah.

21:48.636 --> 21:51.366
Or he picked up the phone
when we weren't looking...

21:51.539 --> 21:55.339
...disguised his voice,
took down the information...

21:55.510 --> 22:01.415
...replaced the receiver without
us noticing, and we were none the wiser.

22:03.351 --> 22:05.615
You will always be...

22:05.787 --> 22:08.620
...none the wiser.

22:15.630 --> 22:17.826
It's open. Come on in.

22:18.968 --> 22:21.528
I said, come in. It's open.

22:42.458 --> 22:46.121
Hey, guys. Come here.
Look at this! Look at this!

22:46.929 --> 22:48.692
There!

22:54.304 --> 22:56.772
- It's Selma.
- That'd be my guess.

22:56.940 --> 23:00.501
- Did you see something weird in the hall?
- I'll say.

23:07.450 --> 23:11.250
If you think I'm cleaning that up,
you're crazy.
