WEBVTT

00:00.648 --> 00:02.115
Superior Donuts S01E11

00:02.602 --> 00:05.054
Well, I'm off.

00:05.219 --> 00:06.852
Arthur, put that on my tab, will you?

00:06.854 --> 00:08.020
Oh, you out of money again?

00:08.022 --> 00:10.474
No, I've just got it
taped to my stomach.

00:10.513 --> 00:11.537
What?

00:11.583 --> 00:13.525
Yeah, last week I was pickpocketed,

00:13.527 --> 00:15.527
and I don't want it to happen again.

00:16.429 --> 00:18.430
But if you insist.

00:23.937 --> 00:25.404
Well, actually, it's $1.25.

00:25.406 --> 00:27.606
I think I've got some change.

00:29.643 --> 00:31.977
I hope this is a quarter, not a nipple.

00:31.979 --> 00:33.712
No, no, no, stop, stop.

00:33.714 --> 00:34.646
We'll call it even.

00:34.648 --> 00:36.582
- Bless you.
- Eh.

00:36.584 --> 00:38.550
- Hello.
- 'Sup?

00:38.552 --> 00:41.086
Randy, my dear friend, you accidentally

00:41.088 --> 00:43.322
left that ticket on my Mercedes.

00:43.324 --> 00:45.691
Uh, you were parked in a loading zone.

00:45.693 --> 00:49.928
That's because I was
loading my mouth with fro-yo.

00:49.930 --> 00:53.065
Sorry, Fawz, the law's the law.

00:53.067 --> 00:54.399
Why don't you just park in the alley?

00:54.401 --> 00:55.367
That spot's always open.

00:55.369 --> 00:56.602
No, no, that's my spot.

00:56.604 --> 00:57.970
I'm gonna park my motorcycle there

00:57.972 --> 00:59.605
when I finally get one.

00:59.607 --> 01:01.440
Then we can park the hearse there

01:01.442 --> 01:03.976
after you go for your first ride.

01:03.978 --> 01:05.744
Well, I will fight this in court!

01:05.746 --> 01:06.945
Well, that'll cost you more.

01:06.947 --> 01:08.947
Then I will pay this today!

01:10.516 --> 01:12.084
Hey, Randy, you let people park

01:12.086 --> 01:13.986
in that loading zone all the time.

01:13.988 --> 01:16.154
Yeah, well, not this week.

01:16.156 --> 01:18.056
They're having a contest
down at the station

01:18.058 --> 01:20.192
to see who can write the most tickets,

01:20.194 --> 01:22.394
and the pot is up to 800 bucks.

01:22.396 --> 01:23.929
- Whoa.
- You remember,

01:23.985 --> 01:25.430
I got that kid going to Northwestern.

01:25.495 --> 01:30.898
800 bucks? That'll pay for
at least 14 minutes of class.

01:30.904 --> 01:33.205
Hey, baby.

01:33.207 --> 01:34.239
Hey, Honeybutt.

01:34.241 --> 01:35.841
How's the conference going?

01:35.843 --> 01:38.443
Hey, Franco, what'd I tell you
about video telephoning at work?

01:38.445 --> 01:40.345
I-I don't remember,
'cause I started laughing

01:40.347 --> 01:43.281
as soon as you said "video telephoning."

01:43.283 --> 01:44.516
Well, say good-bye to Honeybutt

01:44.518 --> 01:46.551
and go get a fresh batch of fritters.

01:46.553 --> 01:48.120
Fine. All right.

01:48.122 --> 01:50.122
Well, I guess I'll see you later?

01:50.124 --> 01:51.723
Oh, no, no, this is fine.

01:51.725 --> 01:54.059
I can talk to you and do
my job at the same time.

01:54.061 --> 01:56.161
It's called multitasking.

01:56.163 --> 01:58.397
Well, if that's true, tell me something.

01:58.399 --> 02:00.699
Can you see my bra through this shirt?

02:00.701 --> 02:01.967
No.

02:01.969 --> 02:03.268
What about now?

02:03.270 --> 02:05.203
Oh, damn! Oh, damn!

02:05.205 --> 02:08.573
Damn! Damn!

02:08.574 --> 02:10.275
What happened in here?

02:10.276 --> 02:12.444
My computer.

02:13.246 --> 02:15.614
This.

02:15.616 --> 02:17.649
Oh... no.

02:17.651 --> 02:18.984
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:18.986 --> 02:21.053
You can use my typewriter
anytime you want.

02:21.059 --> 02:22.056
Brand-new ribbon.

02:22.180 --> 02:26.683
Synced and corrected by Dragoniod for
- www.addic7ed.com -

02:30.930 --> 02:33.465
Damn. It's definitely broken.

02:33.467 --> 02:35.734
They said it would cost more
to fix than to buy a new one.

02:35.736 --> 02:37.536
- That sucks.
- I know.

02:37.538 --> 02:39.604
We've been through so much together.

02:39.606 --> 02:42.574
Got me through high school,
gave me my first e-mail address,

02:42.576 --> 02:45.677
saw me through my Asian girl phase,

02:45.679 --> 02:47.212
my big-butt phase,

02:47.214 --> 02:49.648
my big-butt Asian girl phase.

02:49.650 --> 02:52.384
Who knows where you
would have taken me next?

02:52.386 --> 02:55.520
Long-haul lady truckers.

02:57.657 --> 02:59.825
Man, I was gonna apply to
art school with that computer.

02:59.827 --> 03:01.026
Where am I gonna get the money?

03:01.028 --> 03:02.594
How much you got in
your savings account?

03:02.596 --> 03:05.831
About 40 grand, but I'm
saving up for a yacht.

03:05.833 --> 03:06.898
Well, that doesn't seem like a...

03:06.900 --> 03:07.933
I don't have a savings account,

03:07.935 --> 03:08.967
all right?

03:08.969 --> 03:10.202
They charge $20

03:10.204 --> 03:11.970
every time your balance goes below $200.

03:11.972 --> 03:14.673
And right now my balance is...

03:14.675 --> 03:16.775
nine.

03:16.777 --> 03:18.477
You really should save some money.

03:18.479 --> 03:20.378
How? I make minimum wage.

03:20.380 --> 03:23.014
You know, minimum wage
is not a livable wage.

03:23.016 --> 03:24.382
And I know that from experience,

03:24.384 --> 03:27.285
because I chanted it at a Bernie rally.

03:27.287 --> 03:30.355
Listen, Frank, I wish I could
pay you more than minimum wage,

03:30.357 --> 03:32.324
but, uh, I afraid
that's all I can afford.

03:32.326 --> 03:34.192
Dude, I'm not asking
for a raise, all right?

03:34.194 --> 03:36.828
I just, uh... I guess I
got to find a second job.

03:36.830 --> 03:39.865
But lucky for you, I've got more gigs

03:39.867 --> 03:42.134
coming in than I can handle.

03:42.136 --> 03:45.904
How do you feel about
digging pet graves?

03:45.906 --> 03:48.540
Franco, I'm looking to hire

03:48.542 --> 03:50.475
a part-time assistant to work nights.

03:50.477 --> 03:53.345
What kind of pets we talking about?

03:53.347 --> 03:54.746
No, come on, you don't need another job.

03:54.748 --> 03:57.048
All you need to do is learn
to live on what you make.

03:57.050 --> 03:58.216
You got a budget?

03:58.218 --> 04:00.152
Yeah, I keep it down
in my condo in Florida.

04:00.154 --> 04:01.553
No, I don't have a budget.

04:01.555 --> 04:05.323
I'm 25. My budget is
breakfast, lunch or dinner.

04:05.325 --> 04:06.516
I'm gonna make one up
for you. You'll see.

04:06.548 --> 04:07.720
If you're smart with your money, you can

04:07.766 --> 04:09.413
definitely support
yourself on minimum wage.

04:09.467 --> 04:10.483
Mm-hmm.

04:10.632 --> 04:12.632
All right, but if you change your mind,

04:12.634 --> 04:15.202
I have to bury a zoo bear tonight.

04:17.137 --> 04:19.706
Definitely a two-man operation.

04:23.711 --> 04:25.745
Damn this city.

04:25.747 --> 04:26.847
What's wrong?

04:26.849 --> 04:29.583
Nobody's breaking the law.

04:29.585 --> 04:32.535
How am I supposed to win this contest

04:32.628 --> 04:34.154
if I can't write any tickets?

04:34.156 --> 04:36.623
Ah, look at this guy.

04:36.625 --> 04:40.193
He just parked legally, fed the meter.

04:41.229 --> 04:43.430
Now he's feeding someone else's meter.

04:44.265 --> 04:46.733
What a little bitch.

04:47.568 --> 04:49.035
Here, let's see.

04:49.837 --> 04:52.305
Actually, I see three violations.

04:52.307 --> 04:53.673
Where?

04:53.675 --> 04:55.909
Well, there's unlawful
obstruction of a gas meter,

04:55.911 --> 04:57.511
consumption of food or drink on a bus,

04:57.513 --> 05:00.981
and improper number
of riders on a bicycle.

05:00.983 --> 05:02.782
Wow.

05:02.784 --> 05:05.585
Did you memorize every
single code in the book?

05:05.587 --> 05:07.954
Of course.

05:09.957 --> 05:12.225
You-you... you didn't?

05:12.227 --> 05:15.829
No. I'm attractive, and people like me.

05:17.064 --> 05:20.200
Now come on. I got money to win.

05:20.202 --> 05:22.413
Hey, kid, all done with your budget.

05:22.483 --> 05:24.771
And you'll be happy to know I
found a way to make it all work.

05:24.773 --> 05:26.306
All right, cool.

05:26.308 --> 05:29.910
Wait. $40 a week for food?

05:29.912 --> 05:32.212
- That's pretty high, huh?
- Uh...

05:32.214 --> 05:34.481
How am I gonna eat on $40?!

05:34.483 --> 05:35.815
Well, just do what I do.

05:35.817 --> 05:39.052
Every weekend, I fry up
two pounds of ground beef.

05:39.054 --> 05:41.154
Sunday is Taco Night.

05:41.156 --> 05:43.089
Monday, it's Sloppy Joes.

05:43.091 --> 05:46.092
Tuesday, it's spaghetti.

05:46.094 --> 05:47.661
Wednesday, it's Fiesta Night!

05:47.663 --> 05:48.962
Wait. Wait. Isn't that
just Taco Night again?

05:48.964 --> 05:51.031
Sí, señor.

05:51.033 --> 05:53.667
Damn it! Randy just wrote me a ticket

05:53.669 --> 05:57.070
for giving my wife a ride on my bicycle!

05:58.300 --> 05:59.535
Look, Arthur, look, I appreciate

05:59.574 --> 06:01.847
you making this budget,
man, but, uh, I'm young.

06:01.863 --> 06:02.909
I want to have fun
every once in a while.

06:02.911 --> 06:04.711
Yeah, well, sometimes
you have to make choices.

06:04.713 --> 06:06.212
Besides, there's fun in there.

06:06.214 --> 06:09.449
You get to fry up
ground beef all weekend.

06:10.651 --> 06:13.676
Fawz, look, are you still
looking for a new assistant?

06:13.715 --> 06:14.488
'Cause I can

06:14.543 --> 06:16.144
start there as soon as I'm
done with my shift over here.

06:16.261 --> 06:17.457
Great.

06:17.459 --> 06:19.559
No, wait. Wait a minute. Are you crazy?

06:19.561 --> 06:21.461
You can't work for Fawz.
You know what he is.

06:21.463 --> 06:23.463
Yeah, he's a greedy, ruthless capitalist

06:23.465 --> 06:25.665
who would bleed people
dry to make a buck.

06:25.667 --> 06:27.701
Maya, stop!

06:27.703 --> 06:29.235
I'm blushing.

06:29.237 --> 06:32.619
Hey, believe me, kid.
Uh-uh, don't do that.

06:32.799 --> 06:34.708
- Oh, you're offering me a raise?
- No...

06:34.710 --> 06:36.610
Then don't tell me I
can't take a second job.

06:36.612 --> 06:38.878
Right now Fawz is my only choice.

06:39.497 --> 06:41.364
So, hey, when can I start?

06:41.464 --> 06:43.183
Hey, come by the dry cleaners
when you're done here.

06:43.185 --> 06:44.985
- We can discuss the terms.
- All right.

06:44.987 --> 06:46.386
Now, if you'll excuse me,

06:46.388 --> 06:49.255
I'm gonna go fire my current assistant.

06:49.257 --> 06:51.891
Hey, Francisco, you're fired!

06:51.893 --> 06:55.095
Right after you drive me to lunch.

06:55.097 --> 06:56.429
Oh, this is gonna be a long ride.

06:56.431 --> 06:57.998
I should've thought this through.

07:05.524 --> 07:08.026
Welcome to Fawz headquarters.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.625
Oh, this is pretty disappointing, man.

07:09.688 --> 07:11.227
I thought your office
would be underground

07:11.305 --> 07:14.180
and filled with evil
henchman and crocodiles.

07:14.431 --> 07:16.131
I know it doesn't look like much,

07:16.133 --> 07:18.633
but first rule of
business: keep your overhead low.

07:18.635 --> 07:20.289
Besides, it has everything I need...

07:20.344 --> 07:24.339
a phone, a desk, and it's quiet.

07:26.843 --> 07:28.576
- You get used to it!
- What?!

07:28.578 --> 07:31.446
You get used to it!

07:31.448 --> 07:33.148
Yo, thanks for the opportunity, dude.

07:33.150 --> 07:36.251
Franco, I came to America

07:36.253 --> 07:40.955
with three dollars and this eagle.

07:40.957 --> 07:43.630
And I built all this from nothing.

07:43.732 --> 07:47.400
And because I came from nothing,
I'm very good to my employees.

07:47.402 --> 07:49.068
- Have a seat.
- Cool.

07:49.070 --> 07:50.303
Would you like some tea?

07:50.305 --> 07:51.304
Yeah, sure.

07:53.000 --> 07:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:03.350 --> 08:06.486
My
Mother-in-law.

08:06.488 --> 08:08.187
All right, cool, man.

08:08.189 --> 08:09.923
Um, so what would I have to do?

08:09.925 --> 08:12.091
Well, at first, you can drive me around,

08:12.093 --> 08:13.426
maybe run some errands.

08:13.428 --> 08:16.296
But the more you learn, the
more I'll give you to do.

08:16.298 --> 08:17.564
You'll be my right-hand man.

08:17.566 --> 08:18.965
Word? All right, okay.

08:18.967 --> 08:20.233
So, what about the pay?

08:20.235 --> 08:21.401
Ah.

08:21.403 --> 08:23.236
Open for negotiation.

08:23.238 --> 08:25.004
Tell me...

08:25.006 --> 08:26.372
what does Arthur pay you?

08:26.374 --> 08:28.174
$10.50 an hour.

08:28.176 --> 08:32.246
First lesson... never
reveal your current salary.

08:32.308 --> 08:34.280
Now I could offer you
$10.75, and you'd take it.

08:34.282 --> 08:35.881
I'll take it.

08:35.884 --> 08:39.586
Now you counter-offer,
but when you do, go high.

08:39.587 --> 08:40.886
$20 an hour.

08:42.289 --> 08:43.556
Opening with a joke.

08:43.558 --> 08:45.091
Very good.

08:45.093 --> 08:46.259
All right, $15.

08:47.134 --> 08:48.267
I never responded!

08:48.597 --> 08:51.431
Never negotiate against yourself.

08:51.433 --> 08:55.368
And always be willing
to walk away, like so.

09:00.374 --> 09:03.409
Fawz? Fawz, is that a yes?

09:03.411 --> 09:06.779
That's a no!

09:06.781 --> 09:09.983
Always keep them on their toes.

09:09.985 --> 09:11.718
$13, my final offer.

09:11.720 --> 09:12.952
- $13.50.
- Done.

09:12.954 --> 09:14.387
- All right.
- And one more thing.

09:14.389 --> 09:16.474
Mm-hmm. - You're gonna work
for me, you have to wear a suit.

09:16.536 --> 09:18.124
We run a classy operation here.

09:18.126 --> 09:19.599
Man, I ain't got money to buy a suit.

09:19.655 --> 09:21.655
Not a problem. What
are you... a 34 short?

09:22.063 --> 09:23.429
Mm-hmm.

09:30.871 --> 09:32.839
- There you go.
- All right.

09:32.841 --> 09:34.674
Won't they need this back?

09:34.676 --> 09:37.810
Uh... not until Thursday.

09:42.016 --> 09:45.251
Randy, you are so
gonna win this contest.

09:45.253 --> 09:47.020
I just gave a guy a
ticket for loitering.

09:47.022 --> 09:49.489
He threw it on the ground.
I gave him one for littering.

09:49.491 --> 09:52.525
Wow. You are on fire.

09:52.527 --> 09:54.661
Get back out there and beat your record.

09:54.663 --> 09:56.429
Okay. Well, wait a minute.

09:56.431 --> 09:57.997
Why aren't you out there?

09:57.999 --> 10:00.400
'Cause you're doing such a great job.

10:00.402 --> 10:02.635
You know, if I'm gonna do all the work,

10:02.637 --> 10:04.637
maybe I'll just enter
the contest myself.

10:04.639 --> 10:07.073
Oh, no, you can't do
that. We're partners.

10:07.075 --> 10:09.876
Yeah? Well, you weren't
gonna share the money with me.

10:09.878 --> 10:12.278
Well, what do you need money for?

10:12.280 --> 10:14.482
Your next trip to Comic-Con?

10:14.527 --> 10:16.594
Or, uh, Star Trek-Con?

10:16.885 --> 10:19.852
Or Virgin-Con?

10:19.854 --> 10:21.721
Oh, I'm just kidding.

10:21.723 --> 10:23.956
They're all virgin-cons.

10:23.958 --> 10:25.692
Well, good luck, okay?

10:25.694 --> 10:28.795
Because no one knows their way
around the penal code like I do.

10:28.797 --> 10:30.296
I'm the penal master. The penal...

10:30.298 --> 10:31.898
Stop saying "penal."

10:32.866 --> 10:36.202
Until I can get my body cam on. Go.

10:38.105 --> 10:40.373
- What's up, y'all?
- Oh!

10:40.375 --> 10:42.909
You survived your first
night with Fawz, huh?

10:42.911 --> 10:44.243
I want all the gory details.

10:44.245 --> 10:46.045
Uh, don't, don't start.

10:46.047 --> 10:48.376
Not until I get a cup of coffee.

10:48.447 --> 10:50.508
God, I wish I still smoked.

10:51.119 --> 10:52.285
Hit me.

10:52.287 --> 10:54.454
Actually, it was pretty interesting.

10:54.456 --> 10:56.289
Fawz is teaching me so much.

10:56.291 --> 10:59.826
Well, that was a waste.

10:59.828 --> 11:01.861
Are we talking about the same Fawz?

11:01.863 --> 11:04.330
Racist, misogynist, sexy?

11:04.332 --> 11:07.300
Uh, I think you mean "sexist"?

11:07.302 --> 11:09.969
I really need to get laid.

11:10.938 --> 11:13.106
I'm telling y'all, Fawz
is a smart businessman.

11:13.108 --> 11:15.374
He actually taught me to
negotiate my own salary.

11:15.376 --> 11:17.243
Now I'm making $13.50 an hour.

11:17.245 --> 11:19.159
Wow, Franco, that's great.

11:19.195 --> 11:20.455
How is he able to pay you all that?

11:20.635 --> 11:22.115
Well, he's always thinking
of ways to cut costs

11:22.117 --> 11:23.182
so we can bring in more money.

11:23.184 --> 11:24.350
You know, you should talk to him, man.

11:24.352 --> 11:25.384
He could give you some advice

11:25.386 --> 11:26.719
and help you make this
place more efficient.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.655
Good morning, my protégé.

11:29.657 --> 11:32.225
Or should I say, brotégé.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.827
I brought you a suit for tonight.

11:34.829 --> 11:36.729
Mr. Yakamora is on a cruise,

11:36.731 --> 11:40.533
so you can hold onto this
one for eight more days.

11:40.535 --> 11:41.701
Domo.

11:41.703 --> 11:42.769
Arigato.

11:42.771 --> 11:44.637
Hey, look.

11:44.639 --> 11:46.639
Fawz says you have to
dress for the job you want.

11:46.641 --> 11:50.777
And apparently I want to be
a tiny Japanese businessman.

11:50.779 --> 11:53.713
Well, if Fawz says so, it must be true.

11:55.015 --> 11:57.216
Sayonara.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.553
Maybe it's a bald thing.

12:03.991 --> 12:06.359
Nope, definitely not a bald thing.

12:15.113 --> 12:16.191
Hey, Tush, what you doing?

12:16.449 --> 12:19.917
I'm rehearsing for my TED Talk.

12:19.919 --> 12:21.552
You're doing a TED Talk?

12:21.554 --> 12:22.820
Not the fancy kind.

12:22.822 --> 12:26.824
This woman pays me to
talk to her husband, Ted.

12:28.226 --> 12:30.294
He's depressed, I tell
him stories about my life,

12:30.296 --> 12:32.930
and for some reason, it cheers him up.

12:34.066 --> 12:36.367
Arthur, I need to borrow
Franco for a meeting.

12:36.369 --> 12:37.535
I hope that's okay.

12:37.537 --> 12:38.602
Wait, who are we meeting?

12:38.604 --> 12:40.071
The president of Fast Lube.

12:40.073 --> 12:41.605
Oh, that's a big company.

12:41.607 --> 12:44.175
Yeah. If I can get my hand
on those greasy jumpsuits,

12:44.177 --> 12:47.611
my bank account will be
fatter than Mahira Moghadam.

12:48.681 --> 12:50.481
She's like the Precious of Iraq.

12:50.483 --> 12:53.284
Oh.

12:53.286 --> 12:54.819
Yo, Arthur, is that cool?

12:54.821 --> 12:57.288
No, it's not cool. We don't
close for another 30 minutes.

12:57.290 --> 12:59.724
Man, come on, Arthur, there's,
like, three people here.

12:59.726 --> 13:01.425
It doesn't matter,
you're still on the clock.

13:01.427 --> 13:02.994
Well, I'll come in early
tomorrow, all right?

13:02.996 --> 13:05.029
You heard Fawz, this is a big meeting,

13:05.031 --> 13:06.063
and he needs me.

13:06.065 --> 13:07.131
Wait a minute, you're just gonna leave?

13:07.133 --> 13:08.833
Well, Arthur, you said it yourself, man,

13:08.835 --> 13:10.601
sometimes you got to make choices.

13:10.603 --> 13:12.536
Come on, after the
meeting, we'll drink tea

13:12.538 --> 13:14.872
and play Guess That Stain.

13:19.312 --> 13:20.611
Arthur.

13:20.613 --> 13:21.946
What is going on?

13:21.948 --> 13:23.547
Last week you let him leave early

13:23.549 --> 13:24.949
'cause he wanted to watch a marathon

13:24.951 --> 13:28.386
of Different Strokes.

13:28.388 --> 13:30.855
Look, I'm his boss. He
shouldn't talk to me that way.

13:30.857 --> 13:32.523
Uh-huh. Is it that?

13:32.525 --> 13:34.625
Or might you be just a little jealous

13:34.627 --> 13:36.293
because he's cheating on you

13:36.295 --> 13:39.196
with another older business owner?

13:39.198 --> 13:41.232
Now you're just being crazy.

13:41.234 --> 13:42.533
You know, it's okay to admit

13:42.535 --> 13:44.902
you want to be the guy
that Franco looks up to.

13:44.904 --> 13:46.137
Oh, come on.

13:46.139 --> 13:47.538
He doesn't look up to Fawz.

13:47.540 --> 13:49.940
He's just blinded by the money.

13:49.942 --> 13:51.876
Money he really needs.

13:51.878 --> 13:54.245
Yeah, I know.

13:54.247 --> 13:56.313
Arthur, you've been doing
the same thing around here

13:56.315 --> 13:57.515
for 40 years.

13:57.517 --> 13:59.750
Maybe it's time to
look at your own budget.

13:59.752 --> 14:02.820
Try to find a way to
give Franco a raise.

14:03.855 --> 14:07.291
You mean I have to get
rid of Fiesta Wednesdays?

14:07.293 --> 14:10.161
Aw, Dios mío.

14:11.296 --> 14:12.797
I'm talking about the shop.

14:12.799 --> 14:16.567
There's got to be ways to
cut some corners around here.

14:20.405 --> 14:21.772
Excellent choice.

14:21.774 --> 14:22.907
You sure?

14:22.909 --> 14:24.308
This ain't too Ben Carson?

14:24.310 --> 14:26.977
Can anything be too Ben Carson?

14:26.979 --> 14:29.480
Franco, you have been doing
a great job around here.

14:29.482 --> 14:32.125
So great that I would like
to give you a promotion.

14:32.196 --> 14:32.954
Yeah?

14:32.969 --> 14:35.086
How does vice president
of operations sound?

14:35.088 --> 14:36.821
Get the... yo!

14:36.823 --> 14:38.022
Sounds like the president of operations

14:38.024 --> 14:39.423
better watch his back.

14:39.425 --> 14:40.424
That's me.

14:40.426 --> 14:41.459
Oh.

14:41.461 --> 14:42.593
Well, you know what, man?

14:42.595 --> 14:44.151
I, thank you, man, this is dope as hell.

14:44.183 --> 14:46.797
Well, listen, Fawz
Al-Shahrani is a big believer

14:46.799 --> 14:48.099
in diversity and inclusion.

14:48.101 --> 14:49.900
And you can quote me on that.

14:49.902 --> 14:51.836
- Okay.
- Oh, here they are.

14:51.838 --> 14:54.171
Go ahead, quote me on that.

14:54.173 --> 14:55.372
Hey, Fawz.

14:55.374 --> 14:58.075
Franco Wicks, meet Marcus
Brooks, the president

14:58.077 --> 15:00.377
of Fast Lube, and his associates.

15:00.379 --> 15:01.979
Nice to meet you, Franco.

15:01.981 --> 15:03.414
Yeah.

15:03.416 --> 15:04.548
That's it?

15:04.550 --> 15:06.784
I thought that handshake
would have more steps.

15:06.786 --> 15:08.385
Uh, d... uh...

15:08.387 --> 15:09.386
Excuse us.

15:09.388 --> 15:10.654
Can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah.

15:10.656 --> 15:12.990
- Yeah?
- What? Okay.

15:12.992 --> 15:15.059
This is why you hired me? Huh?

15:20.600 --> 15:24.201
Because you're all black!

15:25.871 --> 15:29.240
Is a great color on you, wow.

15:29.242 --> 15:31.509
Slimming.

15:42.154 --> 15:43.521
Where have you been?

15:43.523 --> 15:45.823
Out kicking your ass.

15:45.825 --> 15:48.959
I just wrote 15 tickets in three hours.

15:48.961 --> 15:50.594
I stood outside Wrigley Field

15:50.596 --> 15:52.163
and picked off the public urinators

15:52.165 --> 15:54.865
one by one.

15:54.867 --> 15:57.168
Who's the penal expert now?

15:58.304 --> 15:59.970
Damn.

15:59.972 --> 16:02.139
Yep, and that contest
ends in five minutes.

16:02.141 --> 16:04.275
I got a three-ticket lead.

16:04.277 --> 16:05.409
Sorry, nerd.

16:05.411 --> 16:07.444
Cool kids win again.

16:08.547 --> 16:10.314
Morning.

16:10.316 --> 16:11.515
Morning.

16:11.517 --> 16:12.750
How was the meeting?

16:12.752 --> 16:14.418
Did you learn a lot?

16:14.420 --> 16:16.086
You could say that.

16:16.088 --> 16:18.689
Hey, you guys are out of paper
towels in the ladies' room.

16:18.691 --> 16:21.158
- I got it.
- No, no. Uh...

16:21.160 --> 16:22.326
Uh, we're not doing that anymore.

16:22.328 --> 16:23.928
It's too expensive.

16:23.930 --> 16:26.764
What?

16:26.766 --> 16:28.632
Did you see the bath
towel I put in there?

16:28.634 --> 16:31.435
Oh. So that's a communal towel,

16:31.437 --> 16:33.537
that's as clean as the
dirtiest person who used it.

16:33.539 --> 16:35.139
You know what, I'll just air-dry.

16:38.009 --> 16:39.343
All right, Arthur.

16:39.345 --> 16:42.313
I'm here to settle my tab.

16:42.315 --> 16:43.714
Here's some change,

16:43.716 --> 16:47.318
separated by denomination
and country of origin.

16:48.520 --> 16:50.688
Should be about twenty
bucks, based on exchange rates

16:50.690 --> 16:54.592
and a possible coup in Venezuela.

16:54.594 --> 16:59.129
And there's 19 bucks left on
this Circuit City gift card.

16:59.131 --> 17:01.665
They went out of
business five years ago.

17:01.667 --> 17:04.734
You could've just said no.

17:04.737 --> 17:06.237
Arthur, what are you doing?

17:06.239 --> 17:07.838
Just asked Tush to pay up his tab.

17:07.839 --> 17:09.205
Why you doing that?

17:09.208 --> 17:12.142
Just a little belt-tightening
around here, that's all.

17:12.144 --> 17:13.978
Yeah, Arthur's trying
to cut back a little

17:13.980 --> 17:15.479
so he can give you a raise.

17:15.481 --> 17:19.550
Right. I realize you can't
live on ground beef alone.

17:19.551 --> 17:22.553
Okay, thank you, but I don't
want you changing this place.

17:22.555 --> 17:23.686
You don't?

17:23.689 --> 17:25.556
What about all that stuff
you learned from Fawz

17:25.558 --> 17:27.324
about how to be a good businessman?

17:27.326 --> 17:29.293
Turns out Fawz was just using me

17:29.295 --> 17:31.662
so he can bring in
more "urban clientele."

17:31.664 --> 17:33.130
You know what I really learned from Fawz

17:33.132 --> 17:35.432
is that that dude would
do anything for money.

17:35.434 --> 17:37.034
And I like that you won't.

17:37.036 --> 17:39.136
I mean, having Tush run his tab here

17:39.138 --> 17:40.871
is what makes Superior
Donuts what it is.

17:40.873 --> 17:44.341
And you can't put a
price on personal hygiene.

17:44.343 --> 17:46.410
I don't like it any more than you do.

17:46.412 --> 17:48.412
So that's a yes on the tab? Great.

17:48.414 --> 17:50.247
I just don't want you

17:50.249 --> 17:52.082
- working for Fawz, that's all.
- Dude, I... Trust me,

17:52.084 --> 17:53.417
I would love to quit.

17:53.419 --> 17:55.386
But right now I need the extra money.

17:55.388 --> 17:56.920
Unbelievable.

17:56.922 --> 17:58.489
My car was parked legally,

17:58.491 --> 18:02.059
and you still give me three tickets?

18:02.061 --> 18:03.761
No, I didn't.

18:03.763 --> 18:05.429
I did.

18:05.431 --> 18:07.965
And we're officially tied.

18:09.134 --> 18:11.268
Unlawfully tinted windows.

18:11.270 --> 18:12.603
No front plate.

18:12.605 --> 18:13.837
Oversized rims.

18:13.839 --> 18:16.106
Mark my words, you will
live to regret this.

18:16.108 --> 18:19.943
And threatening a police officer.

18:19.945 --> 18:22.880
That is nerds FTW,

18:22.882 --> 18:25.716
which means "nerds for the win"

18:25.718 --> 18:28.285
Which you would know
if you weren't so cool.

18:29.287 --> 18:31.188
Damn.

18:31.190 --> 18:34.525
I still got two minutes
before the contest ends.

18:35.327 --> 18:38.629
Hey! You must be doing meth.

18:38.631 --> 18:41.665
Nobody's that skinny in Chicago.

18:43.968 --> 18:45.336
Hey, Fawz.

18:45.338 --> 18:46.970
Maybe I can help you.

18:46.972 --> 18:49.640
How'd you like to park your
car in my space in the alley?

18:49.642 --> 18:51.241
That would be amazing.

18:51.243 --> 18:52.443
Thank you, Arthur.

18:52.445 --> 18:54.078
No, I-I don't mean for free.

18:54.080 --> 18:57.481
I mean, um, maybe I
could rent it to you.

18:57.483 --> 18:59.550
Yeah, um...

18:59.552 --> 19:02.486
Fawz, how much are you spending
a month on parking tickets?

19:02.488 --> 19:03.754
Uh, $300.

19:04.890 --> 19:06.957
Now I can charge you
$250, and you'd take it.

19:06.959 --> 19:08.025
I'll take it.

19:08.027 --> 19:09.793
$275.

19:09.795 --> 19:10.928
Are you crazy?

19:10.930 --> 19:13.564
- Oh, well, I guess I'll just walk away.
- Yep.

19:13.566 --> 19:16.433
You know, Shelly's
Nails has been begging me

19:16.435 --> 19:17.868
- to rent that space.
- Oh, really? Shelly?

19:17.870 --> 19:19.103
- Shelly would love the spot.
- Yeah.

19:19.105 --> 19:20.404
Okay, okay. $275.

19:20.406 --> 19:22.873
Deal.

19:22.875 --> 19:25.476
Well, Franco, you just got a raise.

19:25.478 --> 19:26.844
$275 a month.

19:26.846 --> 19:28.445
Thank you, Arthur. You're quite welcome.

19:28.447 --> 19:29.980
All right. And, Fawz,

19:29.982 --> 19:31.682
with all due respect,

19:31.684 --> 19:35.219
kiss my black ass. I quit.

19:35.221 --> 19:37.654
I am so mad at you right now!

19:37.656 --> 19:39.123
But also proud.

19:40.492 --> 19:42.292
Of how you screwed me over!

19:42.294 --> 19:44.027
Which was masterful.

19:45.063 --> 19:46.964
But I will get my revenge!

19:46.966 --> 19:48.332
Okay, bye.

19:53.294 --> 19:56.004
There you are. I can see
those big, beautiful eyes

19:56.035 --> 19:57.996
on my new computer. Can you see me?

19:58.121 --> 20:00.433
I can see you fine.

20:01.145 --> 20:02.878
Hey, yo, thanks for the raise, dude.

20:02.938 --> 20:04.610
This new laptop is
better than my first one.

20:04.696 --> 20:05.839
Well, I'm happy to do it.

20:06.466 --> 20:07.898
This Skyping is amazing.

20:07.923 --> 20:09.089
I know, right?

20:09.122 --> 20:10.255
Hey, hold the phone up, man.

20:10.343 --> 20:12.009
I'm getting nothing but your nose hair.

20:16.327 --> 20:19.596
Randy, am I walking funny?

20:19.639 --> 20:22.489
Because my pocket's
feeling about $800 heavier.

20:24.406 --> 20:25.908
Go on, have at it.

20:26.008 --> 20:28.086
- You won.
- Yeah.

20:28.187 --> 20:29.445
Actually, you'll be happy to know

20:29.461 --> 20:31.164
that I'm giving half my
winnings to a good cause:

20:31.166 --> 20:33.066
your daughter's college fund.

20:34.530 --> 20:36.455
Oh, James.

20:36.546 --> 20:38.335
You don't have to do that.

20:38.382 --> 20:40.116
Well, like you said.

20:40.186 --> 20:41.571
We're partners.

20:42.063 --> 20:44.777
But I was so mean to you all week.

20:44.779 --> 20:46.846
I feel terrible.

20:48.371 --> 20:50.338
Then it was all worth it.
