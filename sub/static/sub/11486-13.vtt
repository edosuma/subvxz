00:12.000 --> 00:13.592
Crap.

00:15.280 --> 00:16.554
Oopsie.

00:17.600 --> 00:20.353
Oh, Charlie!

00:46.200 --> 00:48.839
Okay, I guess I'll give you a call.

00:55.600 --> 00:57.750
Alrighty, that'd be great.

01:04.040 --> 01:05.917
Sounds good. Looking forward to it.

01:06.120 --> 01:07.473
Bye-bye now.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.111
Swell.

01:13.960 --> 01:15.552
Hey, Alan. You know how to say:

01:15.760 --> 01:17.159
"Please go faster," in Polish?

01:21.840 --> 01:23.910
- Funny language, isn't it?
- Yeah, hilarious.

01:24.120 --> 01:26.953
The earthquake hit Sherman Oaks
a lot harder than Malibu.

01:27.160 --> 01:30.118
- What earthquake?
- What earthquake?

01:30.320 --> 01:32.754
About an hour ago.
You didn't feel the house shaking?

01:38.720 --> 01:40.995
Unbelievable.
You actually thought that was you?

01:41.200 --> 01:44.033
No, I thought it was her,
you know, because of me.

01:45.200 --> 01:47.794
The good news is,
unless they report it on Polish TV...

01:48.000 --> 01:49.479
...I still get the credit.

01:50.280 --> 01:52.396
I'm thrilled for you.
Anyway, Judith called.

01:52.600 --> 01:54.955
A pipe broke,
soaked her living room carpet...

01:55.160 --> 01:56.912
...and she's completely freaking out.

01:57.120 --> 02:00.271
Yeah, well, that's the difference
between wife and ex-wife.

02:00.480 --> 02:03.517
With ex-wife, you don't even have to
pretend to care.

02:04.480 --> 02:06.391
Well, I'm sorry. I can't be that callous.

02:06.600 --> 02:08.352
Have you even tried?

02:09.160 --> 02:11.958
She's the mother of my son.
I'm concerned about her welfare.

02:12.160 --> 02:14.230
I told her she could stay here
until repairs.

02:14.440 --> 02:16.715
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Back up. Back up.

02:16.920 --> 02:20.276
When you told her, did you have, like,
a sarcastic chuckle in your voice?

02:20.440 --> 02:23.716
Like, you know, " Yeah, right, Judith,
you can stay here."

02:24.200 --> 02:26.555
- It's just for a couple of days.
- A couple of days?

02:26.760 --> 02:29.228
Jack The Ripper just killed
a couple of prostitutes.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.714
It was still wrong.

02:30.920 --> 02:33.957
- Do you want me to put her in a hotel?
- Yeah, put her in a hotel.

02:34.160 --> 02:37.789
Put her in a space capsule. Put her
in a catapult and see how far she flies.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.558
Charlie, I can't do that to her.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.955
Again, have you even tried?

02:42.160 --> 02:45.675
- She's afraid of another quake.
- Well, what about what I'm afraid of?

02:45.880 --> 02:48.872
- What are you afraid of?
- Oh, let's see. Large birds. Small bugs.

02:49.080 --> 02:52.117
Unplanned pregnancies.
And your ex-wife living in my house.

02:52.640 --> 02:55.359
Come on, Charlie.
She's just a small, frightened woman.

02:55.560 --> 02:58.358
There are no small, frightened women.
That's a myth.

02:58.560 --> 03:01.711
Perpetrated by the large, angry
women who secretly run the world.

03:01.920 --> 03:05.196
I think it would be healthy for Jake
to see his mother and father...

03:05.400 --> 03:06.913
...living together as friends.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.519
Oh, Alan, grow up.

03:08.720 --> 03:11.792
As long as he's got pizza with cheese
and TV with 150 channels...

03:11.960 --> 03:14.838
...he doesn't give a rat's ass
what you guys do.

03:15.040 --> 03:17.076
Now that I think about it, neither do I.

03:19.480 --> 03:22.756
That had better be a big,
pregnant bird covered with spiders.

03:27.960 --> 03:30.554
- I don't know how to thank you.
- I'm glad you're okay.

03:30.760 --> 03:34.435
Charlie, I know this is a big imposition.
I really appreciate you inviting me.

03:38.120 --> 03:40.190
I thought she should know
this was your idea.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.868
Actually, I had several other ideas.
Wanna hear them?

03:43.920 --> 03:45.831
Tell Jake you're here.
I'll take your bags.

03:46.040 --> 03:47.519
Thank you, Alan. Thank you both.

03:47.680 --> 03:49.955
I promise I'll be out of here
in a couple of days.

03:57.040 --> 04:00.430
- Judith, sit down. I've got it covered.
- No. I can pitch in.

04:00.640 --> 04:03.518
Where do you keep the salad tongs?
Wait, I got them.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.394
- Better use the wooden ones.
- What's wrong with these?

04:06.560 --> 04:09.836
I use those whenever I drop my watch
in the toilet.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.399
This is a regular occurrence?

04:11.840 --> 04:15.628
- You'd think I'd learn.
- And you keep them in the kitchen?

04:15.840 --> 04:19.628
I used to hang them in the bathroom,
but it freaked some chicks out.

04:20.440 --> 04:24.399
He's just kidding with you.
Use the wooden ones.

04:25.040 --> 04:26.359
I don't want any salad.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.633
- Well, you have to have some.
- Dad doesn't make me have salad.

04:29.840 --> 04:31.159
Alan?

04:31.360 --> 04:33.954
He's exaggerating.
We have salad all the time.

04:34.360 --> 04:36.669
I just don't eat it.

04:37.080 --> 04:38.433
It's kind of our compromise.

04:38.640 --> 04:40.790
Okay. Fine.
Your house, your rules.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.355
Technically, it's my house, his rules.

04:43.560 --> 04:45.915
Of course.
Just have a little salad.

04:47.640 --> 04:49.551
So I spoke with
the plumbing company...

04:49.760 --> 04:51.591
...and they'll be there in the morning.

04:51.800 --> 04:54.234
So I'll drop off Jake
and meet them on my way to work.

04:54.440 --> 04:56.192
- Thank you, Alan.
- You're welcome.

04:58.120 --> 04:59.633
This is really weird.

05:00.400 --> 05:04.075
Why? Your mom and I may not be living
together anymore, but we're still friends.

05:04.280 --> 05:07.317
I don't flip off my friends
when I talk to them on the phone.

05:09.720 --> 05:11.551
Nice shooting.

05:11.760 --> 05:13.318
Two with one bullet.

05:14.160 --> 05:17.072
Well, if either of us did,
in fact, do that, it was wrong.

05:17.280 --> 05:20.716
The important thing is we're making
an effort to be nicer to each other.

05:20.920 --> 05:24.037
That's right. And your mom staying here
is a good example of that.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.559
Very nicely put, Alan.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.672
If we leave now,
we can be in Mexico in two hours.

05:33.440 --> 05:34.919
Hey.

05:35.280 --> 05:36.633
Hey.

05:36.840 --> 05:38.751
- Where's Alan?
- Don't know.

05:40.480 --> 05:42.436
Mind if I join you?

05:43.760 --> 05:45.239
Sure.

05:54.960 --> 05:56.632
Thanks again for your hospitality.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.679
Don't mention it.

05:59.400 --> 06:02.119
You know, the TV in your room works.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.310
Oh, okay. Good to know.

06:09.040 --> 06:12.112
I just tucked Jake in.
He loves you very much.

06:12.320 --> 06:14.470
Yeah. I love him too.

06:15.440 --> 06:18.477
You got cable, satellite, DVD.
The whole shebang.

06:18.680 --> 06:20.591
Great.

06:23.440 --> 06:25.510
I'm surprised you're home
on a Saturday night.

06:25.720 --> 06:27.870
What, with your fun bachelor lifestyle.

06:28.080 --> 06:30.640
Well, I got laid this morning.

06:31.080 --> 06:33.640
So I thought I'd kick back tonight.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.952
Oh, my. Well, isn't that something.

06:38.240 --> 06:40.595
- Nice girl?
- I guess.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.279
She doesn't speak English.

06:44.080 --> 06:45.832
Well, hey.
What are you guys doing?

06:46.040 --> 06:47.473
Just watching a little TV.

06:47.680 --> 06:50.592
- What's on?
- I don't know. I just sat down.

06:54.920 --> 06:56.831
Oh, we've seen this movie before.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.439
- No, we didn't.
- Sure we have.

06:58.640 --> 07:01.029
That guy's girlfriend
turns out to be the murderer.

07:01.240 --> 07:04.118
Really? I did not know that.

07:04.320 --> 07:06.436
Oh, right. And she's not really a girl.

07:07.040 --> 07:09.395
I did not know that either.

07:10.640 --> 07:13.757
- When did we see this?
- The first movie after Jake was born.

07:13.960 --> 07:15.712
Oh, right.

07:15.920 --> 07:17.990
It was so hard to leave him
with the sitter.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.555
As soon as we got to the door,
the sobbing started.

07:20.760 --> 07:22.796
Yeah, well, it was hard for me.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.150
You were such a softy.

07:25.360 --> 07:26.952
Alcohol.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.397
While you're up,
you wanna make popcorn?

07:29.760 --> 07:31.159
- Sure.
- No butter for me.

07:31.360 --> 07:32.918
Got it.

07:37.360 --> 07:39.749
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey, Rose.

07:57.160 --> 07:58.991
Anybody here?

08:00.600 --> 08:01.953
Good.

08:09.400 --> 08:10.913
Jeez.

08:11.600 --> 08:15.149
- I'm sorry. I thought you were asleep.
- That's all right. Relax.

08:15.920 --> 08:17.751
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's fine.

08:17.960 --> 08:19.837
- Where's Alan?
- He took Jake to school...

08:20.040 --> 08:23.919
...then went to meet with the plumber.
- Right, right. Okay, I'll leave you to it.

08:24.640 --> 08:26.039
Charlie, wait.

08:26.240 --> 08:28.754
This is your home. Sit down.
Drink your coffee.

08:29.880 --> 08:31.393
Okay.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.554
Oh, and I'm white trash.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.918
What are you, a farm animal?

09:23.720 --> 09:25.915
- What?
- That's your brother's ex-wife out there.

09:26.120 --> 09:27.872
I know who she is.

09:28.080 --> 09:31.390
Oh, no, no. She's just staying here
because of the earthquake.

09:31.600 --> 09:34.797
I'm not. I would never. I couldn't.

09:35.160 --> 09:37.549
Okay, I could. But I'm not.

09:38.520 --> 09:42.115
Yeah. That's what I used to stay
about my stepbrother, Cousin Dewey.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.155
How's it going?
Used to having your mom here?

09:52.520 --> 09:54.158
Nope. You?

09:54.840 --> 09:57.149
I'm still thinking Mexico.

09:57.720 --> 09:59.756
I liked it better
when they weren't talking.

09:59.960 --> 10:02.315
Can't get away with much
when they compare notes.

10:02.800 --> 10:04.677
It's hell.

10:05.040 --> 10:06.871
Jake, your mom wants to say
goodbye.

10:07.400 --> 10:10.278
- She's leaving?
- Just for a little while.

10:13.920 --> 10:16.036
- Where's she going?
- Just out to dinner.

10:16.240 --> 10:19.232
You know, with a friend.
I guess it's a date of some sort.

10:20.240 --> 10:21.798
She's going on a date?

10:22.520 --> 10:24.192
Of some sort.

10:24.640 --> 10:26.596
- And you're okay with this?
- Oh, yeah.

10:26.800 --> 10:30.349
We talked about it. I think it's a sign
of maturity that our relationship...

10:30.560 --> 10:33.791
...has evolved enough that we can be
honest that we see other people.

10:34.080 --> 10:37.197
Yeah, except the people you're seeing
are in magazines and videos.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.515
Hey, I told you
to stay out of my room.

10:42.160 --> 10:44.390
And that's not the point.
If I were dating...

10:44.600 --> 10:47.273
...she'd be just as supportive
of me as I am of her.

10:47.480 --> 10:51.553
We're no longer ex-husband and ex-wife.
We are friends getting on with our lives.

10:51.760 --> 10:53.478
She's happy and I'm happy.

10:53.680 --> 10:56.274
- Okay. I'm leaving.
- Oh, have fun.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.032
Wow, I'm impressed.

11:00.240 --> 11:03.994
What happened to my jealous,
tightly-wrapped, neurotic brother?

11:05.680 --> 11:07.875
Oh, there he is.

11:24.400 --> 11:26.595
Well, well, well.

11:27.440 --> 11:31.638
- Alan?
- Oh, you remember me?

11:31.840 --> 11:33.273
What are you doing up so late?

11:33.640 --> 11:36.108
That's funny, I was about
to ask you the same thing.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.197
Don't tell me you were
waiting up for me?

11:38.400 --> 11:40.470
This isn't about
what I was doing, Judith.

11:40.680 --> 11:41.999
No, no.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.953
This is about
what you were doing until...

11:46.680 --> 11:48.113
...now.

11:48.280 --> 11:51.113
I told you I had a date.
You said you were fine with it.

11:51.800 --> 11:57.079
In theory, I was. In practice,
I think we can both see I'm not.

11:57.880 --> 12:00.348
What did you want me to do,
sit here and do nothing?

12:00.560 --> 12:03.233
Why not?
It was good enough for me.

12:03.440 --> 12:05.715
You know what,
you haven't changed at all.

12:05.920 --> 12:09.549
You're still the same neurotic,
overbearing, control freak I threw out.

12:09.760 --> 12:13.548
Neurotic? Maybe. Overbearing? Perhaps.
But you know what?

12:13.760 --> 12:16.228
You're not gonna throw me out,
because I have changed.

12:16.440 --> 12:19.591
Tonight, I'm leaving you.

12:27.680 --> 12:32.117
As it turns out,
a distinction without a difference.

12:35.280 --> 12:37.919
Fine, Alan. Suit yourself.

12:38.360 --> 12:39.918
Where's Dad?

12:40.240 --> 12:43.676
- He's at our house.
- How come?

12:43.880 --> 12:46.075
Well, we decided we needed
a little time apart.

12:46.480 --> 12:48.710
Isn't that why you got a divorce?

12:49.160 --> 12:50.513
It's hard to explain, Jake.

12:51.320 --> 12:55.279
- Do I get any presents this time?
- No.

12:55.880 --> 12:57.711
What happens now?
You gonna live here?

12:58.040 --> 13:00.270
- No.
- Are you gonna buy a new house?

13:00.480 --> 13:02.038
No.

13:02.240 --> 13:05.038
Wanna go to Mexico
with me and Uncle Charlie?

13:06.120 --> 13:08.111
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

13:08.320 --> 13:09.639
Where's Alan?

13:09.840 --> 13:12.513
- Well, it's a long story.
- You're not gonna believe it.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.797
Hi. I just stopped by
to say I told you so.

13:36.640 --> 13:39.108
I told you so.

13:39.760 --> 13:43.639
Oh, come on, Alan. If you can't
laugh at yourself, at least let me do it.

13:45.040 --> 13:46.598
What do you want, Charlie?

13:46.800 --> 13:48.279
Well...

13:52.000 --> 13:55.151
...first of all, I'd like to know
exactly how you managed...

13:55.360 --> 13:57.749
...to let your ex-wife
throw you out of my house.

13:59.520 --> 14:03.274
Because that's the first thing people
are gonna ask when I tell this story.

14:03.480 --> 14:05.948
She didn't throw me out, I left.

14:06.320 --> 14:11.189
Oh, good, there's a twist. You see,
that's what makes a good story.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.550
- Leave me alone, Charlie.
- Oh, lighten up.

14:13.760 --> 14:17.196
You tried to be friends with the woman
who wrecked your life and failed.

14:17.400 --> 14:19.994
No damage done.
Just a little personal humiliation...

14:20.200 --> 14:24.034
...and at this point in your life,
how would you even notice that?

14:24.720 --> 14:28.030
- Are you finished?
- Did I mention I told you so?

14:28.240 --> 14:31.198
- Twice.
- Counting this one?

14:31.400 --> 14:33.914
- Okay, I'm finished.
- Thank you.

14:34.120 --> 14:36.554
Now, on to new business.

14:36.760 --> 14:41.356
Currently, you and I are sitting in a
house that belongs to neither one of us.

14:41.560 --> 14:45.314
While your ex-wife is sitting
in the house that belongs to me.

14:45.800 --> 14:49.110
- You see the paradox?
- I can't go back there, Charlie.

14:49.320 --> 14:52.551
She's running around, having
a great time, and I've got nothing.

14:52.760 --> 14:55.911
- You've got me.
- Drop dead.

14:56.440 --> 14:58.954
Okay, now you got nothing.

14:59.160 --> 15:01.913
It would be different
if Judith and I were both dating.

15:02.120 --> 15:03.997
True, but moot.

15:04.560 --> 15:07.279
- Unless...
- What unless?

15:07.480 --> 15:09.755
- It's stupid.
- Stupider than this?

15:09.960 --> 15:11.632
Come on. What do you got?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.719
Well, what if you were dating?

15:15.920 --> 15:18.832
- But I'm not.
- But if you looked like you were?

15:19.920 --> 15:22.434
Oh, you mean? No, no way.

15:22.640 --> 15:25.757
I'm not gonna let you fix me up
with one of your bimbo girlfriends.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.712
Okay, forget it.

15:28.760 --> 15:31.069
She'd have to be really pretty.

15:31.280 --> 15:35.239
Like a 10. And young. Like a 20.

15:35.840 --> 15:38.195
- Anything else?
- And smart.

15:38.400 --> 15:41.915
And a sense of humor is important.
Well-read, good with kids...

15:42.120 --> 15:45.556
...non-smoking, of course.
Oh, and easy on the piercings.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.876
Nothing south of the equator.

15:48.640 --> 15:52.872
You're mighty picky for a guy with
an adult newsstand in his sock drawer.

16:01.520 --> 16:04.956
Okay. Homework is taken care of.
He's taking a shower.

16:05.160 --> 16:08.277
You may wanna check in on him,
make sure he's not goofing around.

16:08.480 --> 16:10.835
- Where are you going?
- Oh, I have dinner plans.

16:11.360 --> 16:13.999
- Really?
- Yeah. Hard to believe, huh?

16:14.200 --> 16:17.795
- I didn't say that, I'm happy for you.
- Well, thank you.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.230
Again, I'm sorry I overreacted
the other night.

16:20.440 --> 16:24.433
I want us to have the kind of friendship
that can be mutually supportive.

16:24.640 --> 16:26.437
- Me too.
- You'll go out, I'll go out.

16:26.640 --> 16:29.837
Right. So is this someone
you've been seeing for a while?

16:34.920 --> 16:38.469
Yeah, a while.
But, you know, not exclusive.

16:38.680 --> 16:40.079
I don't wanna get tied down.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.599
Oh, that must be Camille.

16:47.160 --> 16:49.833
- She picks you up?
- Well, what can I say?

16:50.040 --> 16:52.076
It's a new world, Judith.

16:57.960 --> 17:00.599
Hey, wow.

17:03.520 --> 17:06.557
You are so good for my ego.

17:06.760 --> 17:08.432
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hi, Camille.

17:08.640 --> 17:12.109
- Hello, I'm Judith.
- You're Alan's ex?

17:12.319 --> 17:16.632
Wow, I didn't expect
you to be so young looking.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.231
- Thank you.
- I mean, you have such beautiful skin...

17:23.440 --> 17:26.000
...for the mother of an 11 -year-old.

17:28.200 --> 17:29.792
Oh, thank you.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.638
Okay. Well, we should get going.

17:31.840 --> 17:33.956
It was nice meeting you.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.917
I just hope I look half as good as her
when I'm that old.

17:40.480 --> 17:42.118
I'm betting you will.

17:44.440 --> 17:45.998
Man, I don't know how he does it.

17:46.200 --> 17:48.270
I made a big play for her, nothing.

17:48.480 --> 17:51.995
- She's so young.
- Yeah, some guys like that.

17:54.120 --> 17:55.599
I gotta hand it to you, Judith.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.233
You were very mature.

17:57.400 --> 18:00.517
I guess that's because
you're a very mature woman.

18:01.640 --> 18:03.995
Yeah, thanks.
Jake, say goodbye to Mommy!

18:04.200 --> 18:06.350
She's going home!

18:16.120 --> 18:18.554
- Good morning, everybody.
- Good morning.

18:18.760 --> 18:22.275
Sounds like somebody cracked open
the sock drawer last night.

18:23.720 --> 18:27.713
I'm going to ignore that because I am
in such a good mood. Charlie, thank you.

18:27.920 --> 18:32.357
Your ex-wife breaking the sound barrier
on her way out was thanks enough.

18:32.800 --> 18:36.236
I don't even care about that anymore.
That was the best date of my life.

18:36.440 --> 18:39.671
I mean, Camille is smart and funny.
And, oh, boy, talk about pretty.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.872
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I bet she
rocked your world in the sack, huh?

18:43.080 --> 18:47.073
What? No, no. Get your mind out
of the gutter. We just talked all night...

18:47.280 --> 18:50.716
...and then there was a little kissing.
Maybe on our next date, who knows?

18:50.920 --> 18:52.990
But for now,
I'm just gonna play it slow.

18:53.200 --> 18:56.112
- You're playing it slow?
- Yeah.

18:56.320 --> 18:59.437
I don't know where you found Camille,
but she's a bit old-fashioned.

18:59.800 --> 19:02.109
She's not like the ones
you usually go out with.

19:02.320 --> 19:04.072
No, I guess not.

19:06.840 --> 19:10.355
A thousand dollars a night
and he's playing it slow.

19:11.600 --> 19:14.319
You're a good brother, Charlie.

19:15.800 --> 19:17.995
He's playing it slow.

19:20.240 --> 19:22.629
She demanded cash.

19:23.760 --> 19:25.512
He's playing it slow.

19:55.880 --> 19:57.871
