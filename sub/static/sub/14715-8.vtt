WEBVTT

00:00.173 --> 00:01.241
Previously, on "Greenleaf"...

00:01.275 --> 00:04.326
I think he's coming to ask
me about David Nelson,

00:04.360 --> 00:05.929
that trigger-happy cop.

00:05.963 --> 00:07.331
But I've never even met the man.

00:07.363 --> 00:10.802
We are here demanding
justice for Kenny Collins.

00:10.834 --> 00:13.136
Do you and Isabel have a venue yet?

00:13.170 --> 00:15.206
I want you to have it at the house.

00:15.238 --> 00:18.476
Full disclosure... I'm gay.

00:18.509 --> 00:21.145
- Your Uncle Mac.
- He did it again?

00:21.178 --> 00:24.882
- I know everything.
- You don't know,

00:24.915 --> 00:26.584
and you don't know what you don't know.

00:27.211 --> 00:29.420
Stay the hell out of my business.

00:31.254 --> 00:33.845
This one or this one?

00:38.895 --> 00:39.996
Do you have a preference?

00:40.029 --> 00:42.764
- No.
- Yeah, you do, Izzie.

00:42.797 --> 00:45.068
- I know you do.
- I think they're both fine.

00:45.102 --> 00:46.390
I just want to know which one you like.

00:50.273 --> 00:52.075
This one.

00:52.108 --> 00:53.361
Seriously?

00:53.394 --> 00:54.911
Why do you do this to me?

00:54.944 --> 00:56.616
Because I want you to choose.

00:56.649 --> 00:57.697
What you want.

00:57.722 --> 01:00.518
No, I'm just assuming
just once in this process

01:00.550 --> 01:02.252
you're going to want
the same thing I want.

01:02.285 --> 01:04.054
I'm just waiting to see
what it's going to be about.

01:04.087 --> 01:06.089
- Okay, I like this one.
- It's cool, right?

01:06.122 --> 01:07.557
Yeah, I meant that one.

01:07.590 --> 01:09.259
You did not, you just thought too hard,

01:09.292 --> 01:10.714
but I know you like this one.

01:12.447 --> 01:15.098
Okay, and I think that's all

01:15.131 --> 01:17.267
we have to decide today, Mr. Kendall.

01:17.301 --> 01:20.404
Amazing, only a ten-decision day.

01:20.437 --> 01:22.105
It's the lightest
wedding workload I've had

01:22.139 --> 01:23.274
since I asked you to marry me.

01:23.307 --> 01:24.408
Assuming you've told Lady Mae

01:24.441 --> 01:25.971
we're moving after the wedding.

01:26.796 --> 01:27.978
You haven't told her yet, have you?

01:28.012 --> 01:29.346
I'll tell her today.

01:29.379 --> 01:30.892
Baby, if you don't want
to move, just tell me.

01:31.482 --> 01:33.084
We'll stay. I'll do whatever you want.

01:33.116 --> 01:35.485
- I'll tell her today.
- Okay. You promise?

01:35.518 --> 01:37.621
- I promise.
- Hey, cowboy.

01:39.155 --> 01:41.491
Oh, hey, Gigi.

01:41.524 --> 01:42.492
I'm sorry to interrupt.

01:42.526 --> 01:43.771
No, you're not interrupting.

01:44.360 --> 01:46.630
You two have work to do, I assume.

01:46.664 --> 01:47.838
Yeah, yeah. It's just a quick thing.

01:47.863 --> 01:50.033
- Is there not school today?
- There is, there is.

01:50.066 --> 01:51.669
I'm just taking time off to plan.

01:51.702 --> 01:54.038
Which reminds me,
who's your plus-one, Grace?

01:54.071 --> 01:55.649
I'm having the place cards printed.

01:56.072 --> 01:58.009
- Sophia.
- Really?

01:58.042 --> 01:59.343
There's no one special
you'd rather bring?

01:59.375 --> 02:01.047
It's going to be
a really romantic weekend.

02:02.078 --> 02:04.527
- No, just me and Sophia.
- Oh.

02:04.818 --> 02:06.578
Well, maybe you'll meet
somebody on the dance floor.

02:07.384 --> 02:09.152
I'll pray for you.

02:10.553 --> 02:12.056
Okay, you promise you'll tell her?

02:12.088 --> 02:13.290
I promise.

02:15.725 --> 02:16.994
Bye, cowgirl.

02:19.696 --> 02:23.317
- What's up?
- You got a minute?

02:26.737 --> 02:29.006
So, when Mac came into
my office, he said,

02:29.039 --> 02:31.993
"You don't know, and you don't
know what you don't know."

02:33.010 --> 02:35.761
- What does that even mean?
- I don't know.

02:36.580 --> 02:38.249
But I do know that he's in DC today

02:38.282 --> 02:40.318
meeting with somebody, so...

02:42.118 --> 02:46.223
I'm wondering, and forgive
me if this is whatever...

02:46.248 --> 02:47.297
What?

02:48.291 --> 02:50.393
Is there any way to get in his computer

02:50.427 --> 02:52.721
and, like, look around?

02:53.596 --> 02:55.099
I've got one girl who won't testify

02:55.131 --> 02:56.673
and no other leads.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.569
But I'm... is there no way to do that

02:59.602 --> 03:00.969
that won't get you in trouble?

03:01.438 --> 03:03.274
Getting in trouble doesn't matter

03:03.307 --> 03:04.937
given the circumstances.

03:06.142 --> 03:07.097
Meaning what?

03:08.312 --> 03:09.981
Look, no one knows this yet.

03:10.014 --> 03:11.748
We're moving after the wedding.

03:15.618 --> 03:16.513
Where?

03:17.688 --> 03:18.701
Denver.

03:19.456 --> 03:22.125
Izzie's got a cousin that
works for Lockheed Martin.

03:22.159 --> 03:23.695
He's setting me up with a job.

03:26.463 --> 03:29.600
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, thanks.

03:29.633 --> 03:31.434
I still haven't told your mother yet.

03:32.079 --> 03:33.604
Why? She'll be happy for you.

03:33.636 --> 03:36.140
Oh, after paying for our wedding?

03:36.172 --> 03:37.440
Well, she'll act like she's happy.

03:37.474 --> 03:39.439
Just take the money and run.

03:39.809 --> 03:41.070
Yeah, I guess.

03:42.646 --> 03:44.447
So, is there any way
to get into his computer,

03:44.481 --> 03:46.150
for an hour, even?

03:46.183 --> 03:48.452
Yeah, I'll just have Antoine
tell his secretary

03:48.485 --> 03:50.620
we're updating his operating system.

03:50.653 --> 03:53.390
We'll copy Mac's whole
computer onto a zip drive.

03:55.159 --> 03:56.427
You sound like you've done this before.

03:56.459 --> 03:58.629
Yeah, we had a guy a couple years back

03:58.661 --> 04:00.670
downloading porn at work.

04:01.197 --> 04:03.333
Downloading porn in church.

04:03.367 --> 04:05.336
Yeah, it's always something.

04:05.368 --> 04:07.270
- Yeah.
- I will not miss that.

04:09.000 --> 04:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:55.992 --> 04:58.168
I swear, people can't
just live their lives.

04:59.195 --> 05:02.165
Everybody's got to be up in
everybody else's business.

05:02.197 --> 05:03.866
What happened now, babe?

05:03.899 --> 05:06.168
This is the fifth email
I've gotten this week.

05:06.202 --> 05:07.870
Apparently Carlton and his partner

05:07.904 --> 05:09.314
held hands at church on Sunday,

05:09.348 --> 05:10.307
so call out the guard.

05:10.339 --> 05:11.308
I told you it wasn't going to be simple

05:11.341 --> 05:12.743
hiring an out gay man, babe.

05:12.776 --> 05:14.110
- Yeah, but it's just...
- Excuse me.

05:14.144 --> 05:15.278
- ...frustrating.
- Sorry about that.

05:15.310 --> 05:16.812
I just realized how prejudiced

05:16.846 --> 05:17.981
people really are.

05:18.014 --> 05:19.382
I mean, what does it cost them

05:19.414 --> 05:21.350
if two men hold hands
or kiss or whatever?

05:21.384 --> 05:23.353
Welcome, the Bible says it's wrong.

05:23.385 --> 05:24.887
The Bible says that
if you don't have love,

05:24.921 --> 05:26.889
you have nothing... 1 Corinthians 13.

05:26.923 --> 05:28.458
- Read the whole book.
- Mm-hmm.

05:28.490 --> 05:32.195
And we're going to line this whole road

05:32.228 --> 05:34.064
with cherry trees in pots,

05:34.096 --> 05:36.365
and it's just going to
be this wonderful,

05:36.399 --> 05:39.536
lovely white tunnel of love.

05:39.569 --> 05:41.905
And we're going to put
the band right here.

05:41.937 --> 05:43.372
Okay.

05:43.406 --> 05:46.143
And then I'm going to
build a dance floor

05:46.175 --> 05:48.911
right down to the edge of the lake.

05:48.945 --> 05:51.214
Oh! Wow.

05:51.247 --> 05:54.217
It could all be more modest,
you know that, right?

05:54.250 --> 05:56.920
Oh, why would we do this modestly?

05:56.952 --> 06:00.923
Isabel, so few people
find happiness and love.

06:00.957 --> 06:04.762
When it happens, you have to celebrate.

06:06.428 --> 06:07.863
You think Noah's happy?

06:07.897 --> 06:11.502
Marrying you? Of course.

06:14.290 --> 06:15.191
What?

06:19.142 --> 06:23.174
Sometimes I wonder if he isn't
still holding a torch for Grace.

06:23.206 --> 06:24.580
Isabel.

06:24.613 --> 06:26.972
With you on his arm?

06:27.149 --> 06:30.586
Well, pardon
my lapse of loyalty, but no.

06:30.620 --> 06:32.212
Are you sure?

06:32.980 --> 06:35.099
I know they were talking
about getting married once.

06:35.131 --> 06:37.259
Twenty years ago... a lifetime.

06:37.293 --> 06:39.512
- They were children.
- I know,

06:39.714 --> 06:42.966
but now she's here,

06:42.998 --> 06:45.434
and she's preaching,
and she's good, and...

06:45.468 --> 06:47.769
Isabel, all men,

06:47.794 --> 06:50.973
and I mean all of them,
Bishop included...

06:51.007 --> 06:52.263
he put me through it...

06:53.335 --> 06:55.339
think as their wedding day approaches,

06:55.834 --> 06:58.741
"Is she the one, really?

06:59.139 --> 07:01.679
Is she or is she?"

07:01.779 --> 07:04.916
And they flip through
that Rolodex of broken dreams

07:04.948 --> 07:07.587
and make you watch while they do it.

07:10.321 --> 07:12.731
You mark my words.

07:14.264 --> 07:15.612
Noah loves you.

07:20.798 --> 07:22.395
If you say so.

07:22.933 --> 07:24.635
It's a whole lot of fuss for nothing.

07:24.669 --> 07:26.770
We already know what the
answer's going to be.

07:26.803 --> 07:28.472
You don't think they're
going to charge him?

07:28.505 --> 07:31.109
- I know they won't.
- Go on in.

07:31.142 --> 07:33.705
They might. Nelson is black.

07:35.331 --> 07:36.533
Did they announce yet?

07:36.748 --> 07:38.116
Waiting for the prosecutor.

07:38.149 --> 07:39.918
Here comes Mr. Pelke now.

07:39.950 --> 07:41.618
I suspect this will be
the news all of Memphis...

07:41.652 --> 07:42.786
Here he comes. Turn it up.

07:42.820 --> 07:44.852
- Mm-hmm.
- Good morning.

07:45.690 --> 07:49.127
A grand jury comprised of
citizens from Shelby County,

07:49.159 --> 07:52.630
after a thorough investigation
into the fatal shooting

07:52.662 --> 07:53.932
of 16-year-old Kenneth Collins

07:54.301 --> 07:56.534
based on the evidence they heard

07:56.567 --> 07:59.037
and the laws that apply
to the police use of force,

07:59.070 --> 08:02.407
has declined to bring criminal charges

08:02.440 --> 08:04.676
against Memphis City
police officer David Nelson.

08:05.234 --> 08:07.479
- Like I said.
- This was also my recommendation...

08:07.512 --> 08:09.814
- Put it on local.
- ...and the recommendation of my office.

08:09.846 --> 08:11.422
- Thank you.
- Well, there's no doubt

08:11.447 --> 08:13.517
that Calvary's public
support of this murderer

08:13.551 --> 08:15.887
went a long way
to shifting public opinion

08:15.919 --> 08:16.643
on this issue,

08:16.676 --> 08:18.655
and now we're all a little less safe

08:18.688 --> 08:20.218
and a little more sorry.

08:21.125 --> 08:24.523
Karine? Get Triumph on the phone.

08:26.029 --> 08:27.465
I'm going to go talk to that boy.

08:39.042 --> 08:41.845
- Hello?
- David, it's Grace.

08:42.469 --> 08:43.748
Hey.

08:43.780 --> 08:45.150
Hey, I just heard. How you doing?

08:45.182 --> 08:47.718
I'm not sure.

08:47.752 --> 08:49.365
People are pretty upset.

08:50.588 --> 08:51.856
I guess I'm going to
be dealing with this

08:51.888 --> 08:52.856
for the rest of my life.

08:53.404 --> 08:54.765
That's what it is.

08:55.225 --> 08:56.498
Are you still at the Templeton?

08:56.531 --> 08:58.128
Yeah, I can't get out.

08:58.161 --> 09:00.104
There's protestors at all the exits.

09:00.897 --> 09:03.442
It's insane.

09:03.476 --> 09:04.685
I'll be right over.

09:05.536 --> 09:06.570
Was that Dave Nelson?

09:06.604 --> 09:07.972
Yeah.

09:08.004 --> 09:09.740
I thought I'd just, you know, check in.

09:09.773 --> 09:10.874
He sounds like he's in shock.

09:10.907 --> 09:12.543
Good shock or bad shock?

09:13.180 --> 09:14.578
Both.

09:15.230 --> 09:17.115
I'm going to go talk to Antoine.

09:17.469 --> 09:18.715
Noah?

09:19.262 --> 09:20.845
Yeah?

09:23.253 --> 09:24.455
Thank you.

09:25.855 --> 09:26.924
You got it.

09:30.675 --> 09:32.411
The Voice of Life, huh?

09:32.444 --> 09:35.013
Number two Christian network
in the country now, sir.

09:36.949 --> 09:39.485
And the gist of it,
if I understand correctly,

09:40.310 --> 09:41.394
is we pay you.

09:41.427 --> 09:43.234
Well, the syndication fee
is just to cover

09:43.267 --> 09:44.189
distribution and marketing.

09:44.431 --> 09:45.757
It's not like you're airing commercials,

09:45.790 --> 09:46.982
if that's your question, Bishop.

09:47.015 --> 09:48.194
It wasn't a question, young man,

09:48.227 --> 09:49.093
it was a statement of fact.

09:49.118 --> 09:51.596
You'll make ten times the fee
once you're on the air.

09:51.630 --> 09:52.478
Look at it this way.

09:52.511 --> 09:53.543
We rent you the land.

09:54.065 --> 09:56.178
You put up your well. You keep the oil.

09:56.211 --> 09:59.114
Oil? Another dirty business.

09:59.147 --> 10:02.040
Jacob mentioned you were
predisposed against doing TV.

10:02.742 --> 10:03.843
Would you mind explaining why?

10:03.876 --> 10:05.911
I'm not sure I see the need.

10:06.385 --> 10:08.477
The Lord has filled
my cup to overflowing,

10:08.510 --> 10:10.780
giving this boy from
the back woods of Arkansas

10:10.805 --> 10:12.617
more than he ever dreamed possible.

10:12.651 --> 10:15.266
And you don't think God wants
you to have even more?

10:15.954 --> 10:17.482
Don't limit the Lord, Bishop,

10:17.507 --> 10:19.066
that's what I say.

10:19.099 --> 10:21.593
You know, I never thought
I would drive a Jaguar,

10:21.627 --> 10:24.164
and now I have three, you feel me?

10:27.165 --> 10:29.207
Well...

10:30.295 --> 10:32.938
you've certainly given us
a lot to think about.

10:32.972 --> 10:34.540
I know it's a lot to take in.

10:34.573 --> 10:35.607
It wasn't that much, really.

10:35.641 --> 10:37.176
I was just being polite.

10:40.279 --> 10:42.048
I can circle back next week.

10:42.080 --> 10:43.515
That won't be necessary.

10:45.818 --> 10:48.581
- We'll call you.
- Don't encourage him, Jacob.

10:48.614 --> 10:50.589
Well, I just meant after we talk...

10:50.622 --> 10:51.756
About what?

10:52.306 --> 10:53.410
The answer's no.

10:53.443 --> 10:54.594
Why, though?

10:55.633 --> 10:58.140
Son, the Bible says time and again

10:58.173 --> 11:00.532
that Jesus went into a solitary place

11:00.565 --> 11:01.781
and people came to him.

11:01.929 --> 11:03.497
He also went into Jerusalem.

11:03.530 --> 11:05.297
On a donkey to die.

11:06.700 --> 11:09.385
I'm not going to hawk the
Gospel like a Ginsu knife.

11:09.418 --> 11:11.013
Sir, if you don't mind me saying,

11:11.046 --> 11:13.040
that's exactly the kind
of righteous rhetoric

11:13.073 --> 11:14.108
that gets people to tune in

11:14.385 --> 11:16.284
and tithing that big green.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.416
Get out.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.550
I'm just saying you're good.

11:24.584 --> 11:27.622
I'm just saying get out.

11:30.179 --> 11:31.279
Okay, then.

11:32.213 --> 11:33.116
That's twice.

11:38.837 --> 11:40.271
Shut the front door.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.404
What was that?

11:44.336 --> 11:46.239
A rather uninteresting waste

11:46.272 --> 11:47.927
of 17 minutes of life.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.551
Did I miss something?

11:53.747 --> 11:58.084
Pop, why did you even
bother taking this meeting

11:58.118 --> 11:59.486
if you knew you weren't interested?

11:59.518 --> 12:01.254
I was hoping that you would see

12:01.287 --> 12:03.439
the folly of this thing for yourself.

12:04.623 --> 12:05.756
More fool me.

12:05.789 --> 12:07.377
There are a dozen pastors in Memphis

12:07.410 --> 12:10.316
who would kill to have that
slot on Voice of Life.

12:10.763 --> 12:14.839
Sadly, I think that's true.

12:14.864 --> 12:19.205
Now, if you'll excuse me...

12:20.690 --> 12:22.426
I'm going to see one of them.

12:25.316 --> 12:28.085
Black lives matter! Black lives matter!

12:28.181 --> 12:30.883
Black lives matter! Black lives matter!

12:31.417 --> 12:34.248
- Where will you go?
- I don't know.

12:34.812 --> 12:36.614
Delaware?

12:36.719 --> 12:38.022
Why Delaware?

12:38.101 --> 12:41.337
Or Utah, Wyoming, wherever.

12:43.583 --> 12:47.334
Somewhere nobody
knows my name or my face.

12:48.081 --> 12:50.149
Can I say something?

12:52.218 --> 12:53.786
I tried to run away.

12:54.041 --> 12:56.239
I ran harder than anybody's ever run.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.407
But 20 years later, here I am.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.254
Running away doesn't fix anything.

13:03.183 --> 13:05.751
Was anybody spitting on you
or calling you a murderer?

13:06.988 --> 13:08.323
I got a feeling it fixes that.

13:09.419 --> 13:13.292
That's probably true, partly anyway.

13:13.325 --> 13:15.841
I guess I just feel like whatever's
going to heal this city, David,

13:16.066 --> 13:17.905
if that healing is even possible,

13:17.930 --> 13:19.336
you're holding a part of it.

13:19.593 --> 13:21.663
And if you leave, you're going
to take that part away with you.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.129
And then someone with less authority,

13:24.162 --> 13:25.805
someone with less firsthand experience

13:25.839 --> 13:26.778
of what actually went wrong,

13:26.803 --> 13:29.028
someone like me is going
to have to talk and talk

13:29.053 --> 13:31.445
to try to make up for what's
missing from the conversation

13:31.478 --> 13:32.734
because you are not here.

13:33.529 --> 13:34.739
And no one will listen.

13:35.457 --> 13:36.959
They'll say, "It's talk. It's all talk."

13:36.987 --> 13:38.635
And they're right, it will be.

13:39.352 --> 13:42.289
But if you stayed and you said,

13:42.321 --> 13:43.823
"I'm sorry, how can we make sure

13:43.857 --> 13:45.453
that this doesn't happen again

13:45.487 --> 13:47.938
or at least happens less often?"

13:47.971 --> 13:49.588
David, people might listen.

13:52.940 --> 13:54.843
I'm not saying that it wouldn't be hard.

13:56.837 --> 13:58.072
I'm just saying...

14:07.131 --> 14:09.006
I'll send you a postcard from Delaware.

14:12.545 --> 14:13.948
I'll look forward to that.

14:20.141 --> 14:21.889
There you go.

14:22.168 --> 14:23.776
30 minutes or less.

14:25.339 --> 14:26.945
Not a word about this, okay?

14:27.747 --> 14:28.914
Peace.

14:28.939 --> 14:30.272
Peace.

14:34.486 --> 14:37.122
- So, when are you leaving?
- Tonight, if I can.

14:37.147 --> 14:39.282
Well, wherever
you actually end up going,

14:39.330 --> 14:41.132
I hope you find some peace.

14:41.157 --> 14:42.591
I don't know if I deserve it.

14:42.616 --> 14:45.220
You do. We all do.

14:46.962 --> 14:48.198
Thanks for returning my call.

14:50.017 --> 14:51.253
Any time.

14:52.415 --> 14:53.434
Good luck, Pastor.

14:53.913 --> 14:54.982
You, too.

15:18.348 --> 15:21.651
- Noah.
- Oh, hey, Lady Mae.

15:21.684 --> 15:23.654
Are you dieting for this wedding?

15:23.687 --> 15:25.656
Because you're looking
more chiseled than usual.

15:25.689 --> 15:28.192
Well, Isabel's got me
pretty busy for this.

15:28.224 --> 15:30.026
Oh, I am sure she does.

15:30.059 --> 15:31.661
I remember reading
that planning a wedding

15:31.694 --> 15:33.296
is the ninth most stressful thing

15:33.329 --> 15:34.464
a person can experience.

15:34.497 --> 15:35.598
Yeah, that sounds about right.

15:35.631 --> 15:37.535
Yeah, and the tenth is being fired.

15:37.568 --> 15:39.035
I'll have to have a look at that list.

15:39.069 --> 15:40.767
I'll be sure to send it to you.

15:40.800 --> 15:44.374
Noah, do you remember
back when Gigi arrived

15:44.407 --> 15:46.209
and I asked you to keep
an eye on her for me?

15:48.108 --> 15:49.176
Yes, ma'am.

15:49.201 --> 15:51.370
This David Nelson fiasco,

15:51.580 --> 15:53.082
it's such a bad penny.

15:53.107 --> 15:54.836
Yeah, I knew nothing about that.

15:54.861 --> 15:56.097
Oh, I'm sure you didn't,

15:56.520 --> 15:57.688
but it got me wondering

15:57.721 --> 15:59.222
if there's something else, though,

15:59.256 --> 16:02.392
that I should know about.

16:02.425 --> 16:04.658
No, not that I know of.

16:06.753 --> 16:09.223
- Noah?
- Yes, ma'am.

16:09.599 --> 16:11.201
There's something you're not telling me.

16:11.235 --> 16:12.393
I know that look.

16:16.740 --> 16:18.409
Isabel and I have been talking

16:18.442 --> 16:20.711
about moving after the wedding.

16:20.743 --> 16:23.380
Moving? Marvelous.

16:23.414 --> 16:25.415
- Where?
- Denver.

16:25.448 --> 16:26.650
She's got people there.

16:28.354 --> 16:30.156
Then why haven't you said anything?

16:30.286 --> 16:31.588
I don't know.

16:31.622 --> 16:33.424
I guess I felt bad.

16:33.457 --> 16:34.725
You and the bishop have
been doing so much for us.

16:34.757 --> 16:37.494
It's a gift. No strings.

16:38.231 --> 16:40.771
Oh, this is so exciting!

16:42.247 --> 16:43.549
Thank you for understanding.

16:43.633 --> 16:45.268
Oh, you don't have to thank me.

16:45.301 --> 16:46.787
It is our pleasure.

16:47.771 --> 16:49.979
Well, run along.

16:50.380 --> 16:52.182
I know you have things to do, busy man.

16:52.211 --> 16:54.346
- Go on.
- God is good.

16:54.477 --> 16:56.053
All the time.

16:57.747 --> 16:59.382
Now make sure we're
hitting Harbor Town

16:59.415 --> 17:00.485
and Victorian Village.

17:00.518 --> 17:02.341
I don't want to just be
in black neighborhoods.

17:03.949 --> 17:06.457
Bishop Greenleaf, come to join us?

17:06.489 --> 17:07.757
We're getting the word out.

17:07.790 --> 17:09.053
What word is that, Pastor?

17:09.492 --> 17:11.549
That God wins in the end.

17:12.915 --> 17:15.219
I'm not sure that perpetuating
a spirit of conflict

17:15.261 --> 17:18.499
in a city that sorely needs peace

17:18.523 --> 17:20.326
is a win for God or anybody else.

17:20.483 --> 17:21.954
You brought the smackdown

17:22.105 --> 17:23.662
and now you just want us to keep quiet?

17:24.173 --> 17:26.376
I'm sorry, you could silence me

17:26.410 --> 17:27.577
and all the rest of these fine folks...

17:27.611 --> 17:28.813
And the rocks and stones would cry out.

17:28.845 --> 17:30.480
I'm familiar with the passage, Pastor.

17:30.514 --> 17:32.491
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

17:34.367 --> 17:36.892
- How's that audit coming?
- Oh, it's over.

17:37.520 --> 17:38.497
Barely noticed it.

17:38.530 --> 17:40.854
Oh, no, I wasn't talking
about the church audit.

17:41.358 --> 17:43.327
No, I prayed for a swift

17:43.360 --> 17:46.038
and painless completion to that one.

17:46.390 --> 17:48.025
It wouldn't profit any black church

17:48.050 --> 17:49.351
if one as prominent as yours

17:49.376 --> 17:52.078
was caught cooking the books.

17:52.835 --> 17:54.537
No, it would just
make everybody look bad.

17:54.871 --> 17:56.727
No, I meant the personal audit.

17:57.541 --> 17:58.439
That one.

17:59.142 --> 18:01.178
We were all concerned around here

18:01.210 --> 18:02.438
when we heard about that.

18:03.846 --> 18:05.927
May we possibly speak in private?

18:05.952 --> 18:07.885
I'm afraid I don't have time for that.

18:07.918 --> 18:10.321
Besides, that whole behind
closed doors thing?

18:10.353 --> 18:11.358
It's history.

18:11.854 --> 18:14.118
No, that's for people
with something to hide.

18:14.557 --> 18:16.294
Go on and say what you got to say.

18:17.970 --> 18:19.786
Whip people up all you want.

18:20.863 --> 18:22.732
Make all your big mistakes now, Pastor.

18:22.766 --> 18:25.481
Lord knows, I've made some in my day.

18:26.570 --> 18:28.639
But you keep me and Calvary out of it.

18:28.671 --> 18:30.708
Now, why would I do that?

18:30.740 --> 18:33.276
My Lord commands me in His holy word

18:33.310 --> 18:34.445
to speak out against evil.

18:34.477 --> 18:36.816
David Nelson is a member of my church,

18:37.289 --> 18:38.691
and this ain't about the police.

18:38.716 --> 18:41.085
Oh, I know. They are all
brave men and women.

18:41.214 --> 18:42.616
They're so admirable.

18:42.686 --> 18:44.655
I saw your sermon online,

18:44.688 --> 18:46.390
the way you painted that whole picture

18:46.422 --> 18:48.558
in such glorious color, Bishop,

18:48.592 --> 18:50.483
I almost forgot it was a murder scene.

18:51.394 --> 18:52.443
Almost.

18:52.895 --> 18:54.864
But I'm afraid you fail
to understand, Bishop.

18:54.898 --> 18:56.491
I was talking about you.

18:58.285 --> 18:59.520
I'm not sure I understand.

18:59.545 --> 19:01.115
Oh, I know you don't.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.708
But soon, Bishop James
Greenleaf, soon enough.

19:03.907 --> 19:06.877
Yes, soon, Lord,
that sun of righteousness

19:06.910 --> 19:08.879
will rise on you like a fiery furnace

19:08.911 --> 19:10.314
and you'll be longing for the days

19:10.346 --> 19:12.388
when all I did was call you out.

19:13.169 --> 19:14.500
Count on it.

19:15.619 --> 19:18.689
Pastor, we're ready for you.

19:23.727 --> 19:24.642
Still nothing?

19:24.862 --> 19:26.738
I'm looking through his calendar

19:26.763 --> 19:28.333
around the time
Danielle went to the cops,

19:28.364 --> 19:29.802
around the time she recanted.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.170
I'm hoping there will
be something there.

19:31.368 --> 19:32.276
If you need to go...

19:32.301 --> 19:33.787
No, no, I'm good.

19:34.371 --> 19:35.672
If I go back to my office,

19:35.706 --> 19:38.509
I'll just have to write my vows.

19:38.542 --> 19:40.444
Just say how you feel.

19:45.410 --> 19:46.312
Huh.

19:47.718 --> 19:48.819
What? Did you find something?

19:49.163 --> 19:50.254
I'm not sure yet.

19:50.286 --> 19:51.750
It's an address in Nashville.

19:53.023 --> 19:54.558
Sometimes when you add something

19:54.591 --> 19:55.993
into your calendar
directly from an email,

19:56.025 --> 19:57.695
it automatically
imports the contact info

19:57.727 --> 19:58.762
along with the event.

19:58.795 --> 19:59.771
So...

20:05.401 --> 20:06.536
Oh.

20:09.739 --> 20:10.775
Take a look at this.

20:18.881 --> 20:20.401
Yeah.

20:21.752 --> 20:22.653
We got him.

20:29.939 --> 20:31.472
Hey, you want to help?

20:31.774 --> 20:33.017
It's not a question.

20:33.942 --> 20:35.444
Sure. What do I do?

20:35.477 --> 20:36.679
Zora can show you.

20:39.114 --> 20:40.749
What are these for?

20:40.783 --> 20:42.169
Isabel's wedding.

20:43.919 --> 20:44.752
Cool.

20:45.153 --> 20:46.588
We'll see how cool your fingers feel

20:46.621 --> 20:48.166
50 cranes from now.

20:52.594 --> 20:54.029
How's your Bible coming?

20:54.779 --> 20:56.932
I have to read the whole Bible this year

20:56.966 --> 20:58.935
from start to finish.

20:59.290 --> 21:01.204
- Wow.
- So, where are you? Tell me.

21:01.583 --> 21:03.940
- Judges.
- Oh, Judges.

21:03.973 --> 21:05.775
That's the one with Samson and Delilah.

21:05.807 --> 21:07.609
It's also the one with the tale

21:07.642 --> 21:09.384
of the Levite's concubine.

21:10.716 --> 21:12.472
What's a Levite's concubine?

21:12.981 --> 21:15.851
You ready to flip the eff out?

21:15.884 --> 21:16.944
Zora.

21:16.977 --> 21:19.189
It's a Bible story.

21:19.894 --> 21:21.924
- Tell me.
- All right.

21:22.414 --> 21:24.061
Get ready.

21:42.178 --> 21:44.200
- What are you doing here?
- I need to talk to you.

21:44.546 --> 21:45.614
My mom will be home soon.

21:46.016 --> 21:48.517
I told you, nothing happened.

21:48.551 --> 21:50.224
Danielle, I know about Nashville.

21:53.555 --> 21:55.328
I mean, TV's a great idea.

21:55.858 --> 21:59.496
It might not be the most original one
in the world, but it's a good one.

21:59.705 --> 22:02.031
But why didn't you tell me you
were going to go to him with this?

22:02.064 --> 22:04.734
Because I wanted him
to say yes on its own merits,

22:04.766 --> 22:05.869
not because you made him do it.

22:06.321 --> 22:08.072
If he ever does reinstate me,

22:08.103 --> 22:09.738
I just want it to be
because I deserve it.

22:09.772 --> 22:12.288
But television is
something he'll never do.

22:13.369 --> 22:14.910
Now, Mac told you that, didn't he?

22:15.513 --> 22:17.080
Uncle Mac told you I talked to him?

22:17.112 --> 22:19.748
What's tragic is because
you didn't run it by me,

22:19.782 --> 22:21.505
you now discredited yourself further.

22:21.690 --> 22:23.585
Why won't he do TV, though?

22:23.619 --> 22:25.255
I mean, he beats the hell
out of marketing and outreach

22:25.287 --> 22:27.089
at every staff meeting,

22:27.122 --> 22:29.092
telling them get more
people in the doors.

22:29.124 --> 22:31.560
That's all TV is, just
more people in the doors.

22:31.593 --> 22:33.228
- Jacob...
- He says he wants me to be humble.

22:33.262 --> 22:35.732
- He's not humble.
- All right, Jacob, stop.

22:36.024 --> 22:37.344
The damage is done.

22:37.632 --> 22:39.535
There's no need complaining.

22:41.137 --> 22:42.391
It's just...

22:44.640 --> 22:46.042
I just wish I understood.

22:49.644 --> 22:50.613
So...

22:51.980 --> 22:53.591
Thank you for making this.

22:54.316 --> 22:56.191
Thank you for asking me.

22:56.819 --> 22:59.556
You know I like making
you your bread pudding.

23:00.855 --> 23:03.158
He helped my mama out.

23:03.993 --> 23:06.129
She got into some trouble
for writing bad checks

23:06.161 --> 23:07.841
and had to go to court.

23:08.997 --> 23:12.067
She said he'd be better than
any of the lawyers, for free.

23:14.336 --> 23:16.305
He came over a lot...

23:16.339 --> 23:18.214
to work on the case.

23:19.842 --> 23:24.544
Then he started coming over
just to, like, check in.

23:27.016 --> 23:28.817
He would pick me up from school

23:28.851 --> 23:30.711
when my mom couldn't,

23:31.687 --> 23:33.358
and he would bring us dinner.

23:34.488 --> 23:35.927
He seemed nice.

23:40.862 --> 23:42.932
Then he said he'd teach me to fish.

23:45.700 --> 23:48.922
That's when he started taking
me out to the church camp...

23:50.706 --> 23:52.170
to fish.

23:59.381 --> 24:02.751
I swore to myself
I wouldn't tell anyone,

24:03.718 --> 24:05.028
and I didn't.

24:05.388 --> 24:07.122
Till you realized you were pregnant.

24:13.728 --> 24:15.455
So I went to the police,

24:16.744 --> 24:18.635
and they called my mom.

24:20.069 --> 24:22.038
Then her and Uncle Mac said I should say

24:22.071 --> 24:23.640
I made the whole thing up.

24:26.242 --> 24:27.432
So I did.

24:38.254 --> 24:41.157
Then they brought me to Nashville and...

24:45.928 --> 24:47.330
Hey.

24:49.931 --> 24:51.643
Am I going to go to Hell?

24:51.933 --> 24:53.234
What for?

24:53.886 --> 24:55.123
Killing my baby.

24:57.773 --> 24:59.042
No, sweetheart.

24:59.074 --> 25:00.410
No, you're not going to go to Hell.

25:00.442 --> 25:02.177
You're not going to go to Hell.

25:04.364 --> 25:05.347
Sweetheart.

25:09.785 --> 25:11.920
Danielle, honey, do you think now

25:11.954 --> 25:13.756
that you can come with me to the police?

25:13.788 --> 25:15.668
Tell them what really happened?

25:17.459 --> 25:20.429
- Is there anyone else?
- What do you mean?

25:20.462 --> 25:23.932
Before, you said you'd find someone
else that he'd done this to

25:23.966 --> 25:25.767
so they'd believe me.

25:25.801 --> 25:27.203
I can try, but...

25:29.160 --> 25:30.732
hey, what's that look?

25:31.306 --> 25:33.108
Mama's going to get in trouble.

25:33.766 --> 25:35.311
Why, because she told you to lie?

25:35.343 --> 25:38.814
No, because of the scholarship.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.592
What scholarship?

25:41.842 --> 25:43.308
The one Uncle Mac got her.

25:57.191 --> 25:59.627
Your drawer. Hey, wait a sec.

25:59.660 --> 26:02.397
Don't worry. It will all
be back after the wedding

26:02.892 --> 26:07.297
with more clothes than you've
ever seen in your life.

26:07.468 --> 26:09.196
Good thing that we're moving.

26:09.790 --> 26:10.925
You talked to Lady Mae?

26:10.950 --> 26:12.693
- I did.
- And?

26:13.218 --> 26:14.954
No problem. Full speed ahead.

26:19.680 --> 26:21.649
I'm sorry if I've been difficult.

26:21.682 --> 26:25.519
Oh, no, you haven't been difficult.

26:25.553 --> 26:27.656
I've been directive.

26:27.688 --> 26:30.086
You've been interesting.

26:30.624 --> 26:32.823
I just can't wait to be your wife

26:33.356 --> 26:35.159
and have this whole waiting behind us.

26:35.184 --> 26:36.477
You and me both.

26:40.235 --> 26:41.998
Okay. Okay.

26:42.023 --> 26:44.208
We made it this far without
totally breaking our vows.

26:44.241 --> 26:45.652
Come on, just one last...

26:45.677 --> 26:46.835
- Mm-mm.
- Just one?

26:46.867 --> 26:47.886
You be good.

26:47.911 --> 26:48.635
When we're married,

26:48.660 --> 26:50.611
we'll still do that, right?

26:50.645 --> 26:52.481
Make room in that closet.

26:54.012 --> 26:55.080
I will.

27:00.223 --> 27:02.383
Thank you, God, for this love.

27:03.416 --> 27:04.873
Thank you, God, for this love.

27:05.263 --> 27:06.811
- Amen.
- Amen.

27:17.339 --> 27:18.311
Good morning, Darlene.

27:18.808 --> 27:20.309
Good morning, Pastor Greenleaf.

27:20.343 --> 27:22.278
Thank you for being so willing
to come in on a Saturday.

27:22.311 --> 27:23.813
Oh, it's nothing but a thing.

27:23.846 --> 27:25.449
So, what's on the docket for today?

27:25.481 --> 27:27.116
Why don't you come on in to my office?

27:27.150 --> 27:29.086
Sounds good.

27:32.855 --> 27:34.324
Darlene, let me start by apologizing

27:34.356 --> 27:36.460
for the strangeness
of what I'm about to say.

27:36.492 --> 27:38.162
Oh, have I done something wrong?

27:38.194 --> 27:39.829
No, no. No.

27:39.863 --> 27:41.164
Nothing like that.

27:41.198 --> 27:43.012
Oh, praise the Lord.

27:44.366 --> 27:46.703
Lady Mae's annual luncheon
is coming up in a few weeks.

27:46.737 --> 27:49.173
I know. I can't wait.

27:49.205 --> 27:52.108
She always delivers
such a strong message.

27:52.142 --> 27:54.478
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but part of the ceremony

27:54.510 --> 27:56.180
will be the presentation
of her scholarship

27:56.212 --> 27:57.148
to ten local women, right?

27:57.180 --> 27:58.143
Mm-hmm. That's right.

27:58.168 --> 28:00.183
She gives out money
from her auxiliary funds

28:00.217 --> 28:03.126
for education
and entrepreneurial projects.

28:03.158 --> 28:06.190
Yes, she has made such a huge
difference in the community

28:06.222 --> 28:07.858
with those grants.

28:08.892 --> 28:11.108
Your daughter Vida was a
recipient a few years ago,

28:11.141 --> 28:12.196
wasn't she?

28:12.229 --> 28:14.141
About eight years ago, yes.

28:14.217 --> 28:16.021
To send her to beauty school.

28:16.477 --> 28:17.409
That's right.

28:17.977 --> 28:19.836
I was looking through some paperwork

28:19.869 --> 28:21.237
related to the scholarships

28:21.270 --> 28:25.231
and all the other recipients
submitted applications.

28:26.910 --> 28:27.990
Vida didn't.

28:29.412 --> 28:32.516
Well, because I work here,
it wasn't really necessary

28:32.548 --> 28:35.818
on account of everyone knew
what Vida was hoping to do.

28:36.295 --> 28:38.863
It just happened.

28:39.257 --> 28:40.170
Mm-hmm.

28:41.023 --> 28:42.391
Is Vida in trouble?

28:43.343 --> 28:44.543
No, Darlene.

28:45.428 --> 28:46.398
No.

28:48.041 --> 28:49.176
I think I should go.

28:49.225 --> 28:51.916
- Darlene?
- Yes, Pastor?

28:54.436 --> 28:56.005
Did Lady Mae know?

28:59.214 --> 29:00.294
Know what?

29:01.577 --> 29:03.534
The reason Vida got that money.

29:07.584 --> 29:08.630
No.

29:10.586 --> 29:12.490
Mr. McCready arranged it.

29:15.458 --> 29:17.374
I don't think Lady Mae ever knew.

29:18.208 --> 29:20.006
She was just happy to help.

29:24.134 --> 29:25.751
I knew it wasn't right.

29:27.447 --> 29:29.413
Why did you stay,

29:30.307 --> 29:32.934
with him right down
the hall all these years?

29:33.324 --> 29:34.944
Calvary's my church,

29:34.978 --> 29:37.381
and I thought we had put it past us.

29:41.151 --> 29:43.459
The Bible says don't look back.

29:49.326 --> 29:51.228
I'm so sorry.

30:14.351 --> 30:16.153
Hey, is Isabel here?

30:17.653 --> 30:19.323
No, she's with her folks.

30:19.355 --> 30:22.189
- Why?
- Can I come in?

30:23.046 --> 30:24.929
Yeah, come on in.

30:29.298 --> 30:32.336
Ten women a year for the past 15 years

30:32.368 --> 30:34.527
have received scholarships
from that fund.

30:36.301 --> 30:38.570
I know at least two of those
were actually payoffs for Mac.

30:38.595 --> 30:40.931
I think it's safe
to assume there are more.

30:41.044 --> 30:43.513
That would make sense.
If it worked twice...

30:43.546 --> 30:45.349
Which means if we turn Mac in,

30:45.382 --> 30:46.583
the fact that money from the church

30:46.615 --> 30:47.984
was used to silence these girls...

30:48.018 --> 30:49.653
Yeah, but it was just Mac, right?

30:49.685 --> 30:51.053
I mean, he was acting alone.

30:51.086 --> 30:52.055
Yeah, but it doesn't look that way,

30:52.087 --> 30:53.151
and he knew that.

30:53.522 --> 30:55.192
In the time between it looking like

30:55.224 --> 30:56.993
my mother knew about it
and proving that she didn't...

30:57.027 --> 30:58.327
There would be a huge scandal.

30:58.361 --> 30:59.528
It would look like she knew about it.

30:59.561 --> 31:01.464
It would look like my dad knew about it.

31:06.945 --> 31:07.977
That's what he meant

31:08.810 --> 31:11.141
when he said I didn't know
what I didn't know.

31:16.578 --> 31:18.530
I could just kill him.

31:19.108 --> 31:21.550
Look, I know it's not simple,

31:21.584 --> 31:23.253
but you got the proof
you were looking for.

31:23.634 --> 31:25.222
Danielle will come forward

31:25.255 --> 31:27.057
now that you have
this other girl, right?

31:27.089 --> 31:28.233
That's what she said.

31:28.590 --> 31:30.394
So, you can go to the police.

31:30.426 --> 31:32.009
Yeah, and destroy the church.

31:32.913 --> 31:36.032
Look, you knew that might be
the case when you came back.

31:36.265 --> 31:38.635
- You said...
- I know what I said, Noah.

31:41.946 --> 31:44.174
I didn't know what it would mean to me.

31:48.362 --> 31:49.646
I didn't know.

31:54.616 --> 31:56.147
Who was that on the phone?

31:57.119 --> 31:58.627
Mac.

32:00.123 --> 32:02.364
How'd it go with his friend in DC?

32:02.932 --> 32:04.594
They've called off the dogs.

32:04.626 --> 32:06.363
There won't be any personal audit.

32:09.766 --> 32:11.403
Don't look at me like that.

32:12.602 --> 32:13.820
He got us in that mess.

32:14.104 --> 32:15.439
I don't think he deserves no prize

32:15.471 --> 32:16.811
for getting us out of it.

32:17.740 --> 32:19.108
It would have been better
if the whole thing

32:19.142 --> 32:20.652
hadn't happened in the first place.

32:23.052 --> 32:24.213
Ah.

32:35.876 --> 32:37.461
When are you going to tell the children

32:37.493 --> 32:38.404
or let me?

32:41.565 --> 32:43.767
Our son is laboring
under the supposition

32:43.799 --> 32:45.434
that he's disappointed you

32:45.468 --> 32:48.183
and that's why you won't go on TV.

32:57.079 --> 32:58.217
What are you going to do?

32:58.251 --> 32:59.505
I don't know.

33:01.448 --> 33:04.653
I'm remembering now
why I left the first time.

33:04.686 --> 33:06.490
Just go to the police.

33:06.522 --> 33:08.157
That's what you came back to do.

33:08.191 --> 33:09.267
Do it.

33:10.192 --> 33:11.331
Yeah.

33:12.528 --> 33:13.643
What?

33:14.696 --> 33:16.500
You're getting married.

33:16.532 --> 33:17.800
I know.

33:17.834 --> 33:19.066
It's crazy, right?

33:21.085 --> 33:21.876
What?

33:23.205 --> 33:25.509
- Nothing.
- No, say it.

33:25.541 --> 33:28.278
We might not get the chance
to talk like this again.

33:32.214 --> 33:33.493
I was just thinking...

33:37.304 --> 33:38.899
I was just thinking,

33:39.721 --> 33:41.611
if all this hadn't happened,

33:42.659 --> 33:43.826
that son of a bitch

33:43.859 --> 33:45.762
hadn't done what he did to Faith...

33:48.397 --> 33:50.134
we'd still be together.

33:53.113 --> 33:54.415
I don't know about that.

33:54.508 --> 33:55.730
We might be.

33:57.874 --> 33:59.241
I always thought you'd wind up

33:59.275 --> 34:02.646
with someone more exciting.

34:04.048 --> 34:05.214
You think that's what I want?

34:05.248 --> 34:06.349
Someone more exciting?

34:09.418 --> 34:11.945
Noah.

34:13.422 --> 34:15.418
You were home to me.

34:17.594 --> 34:19.663
When I was with you, I was home.

34:21.898 --> 34:24.841
He took that away from me,
along with everything else.

34:25.268 --> 34:26.649
I hate him for that.

34:28.871 --> 34:30.449
Noah.

34:34.610 --> 34:35.617
I should go.

34:37.545 --> 34:38.681
Yeah.

34:39.916 --> 34:41.318
You probably should.

34:56.797 --> 34:58.601
God, I'm sorry.

34:58.635 --> 35:00.008
No, no. Don't be.

35:34.469 --> 35:35.679
Again.

35:36.472 --> 35:39.877
Noah, come here. Come here.

35:42.344 --> 35:43.946
I love you.

35:43.980 --> 35:45.581
I love you, too.

37:20.578 --> 37:21.814
You're up early.

37:24.283 --> 37:26.626
Yeah, you, too, Mama.

37:27.419 --> 37:28.554
Oh, I've been up most of the night

37:28.586 --> 37:29.810
worrying about your brother.

37:30.289 --> 37:31.723
Why? What happened now?

37:31.756 --> 37:33.525
What happened? You.

37:33.559 --> 37:34.694
You happened.

37:34.727 --> 37:35.694
I got to get ready for church.

37:35.727 --> 37:36.861
Don't you walk away from me.

37:36.894 --> 37:38.530
Mama, can we just not, please?

37:38.564 --> 37:39.941
Grace, as long as you're here,

37:39.966 --> 37:42.234
your father's going to continue
to deny Jacob his rightful place.

37:42.267 --> 37:43.635
His rightful place.

37:43.669 --> 37:44.978
Mama, before I left,

37:45.011 --> 37:47.002
Jacob was talking about playing
minor league baseball.

37:47.034 --> 37:48.307
He never wanted to preach.

37:48.339 --> 37:49.575
No, he didn't.

37:49.607 --> 37:50.876
But you ran off and left your father

37:50.908 --> 37:52.677
with nobody to help and he stepped up.

37:52.711 --> 37:54.124
Because you pushed him.

37:54.580 --> 37:56.549
Church is not a family business.

37:56.582 --> 37:57.683
Preaching is a call from God.

37:57.716 --> 37:59.551
And who are you to stand here

37:59.584 --> 38:01.019
talking about being called by God,

38:01.053 --> 38:03.623
looking like you been rode
hard and put away wet?

38:04.357 --> 38:06.227
Where have you been all night?

38:07.941 --> 38:08.688
Out.

38:08.722 --> 38:10.462
Well, your car never left the driveway.

38:10.857 --> 38:13.332
So, where were you, Pastor Greenleaf?

38:16.769 --> 38:17.903
It's not what you think.

38:17.935 --> 38:19.905
Lying. You want to add that

38:19.937 --> 38:21.945
to your list of sins this morning?

38:22.800 --> 38:25.576
Sometimes it seems like
you won't be satisfied

38:25.611 --> 38:27.847
until you have burned
this place to the ground.

38:32.450 --> 38:33.745
Are...

38:34.620 --> 38:37.924
I'd be angry if I wasn't so
filled with sympathy for you.

38:39.657 --> 38:41.526
You must be so lonely.

38:48.700 --> 38:50.669
So, anyway, on their way back home,

38:50.702 --> 38:51.670
they stop in this little town.

38:51.703 --> 38:52.772
Mm-hmm.

38:52.805 --> 38:54.073
And a bunch of men come to the door

38:54.106 --> 38:55.607
of the house they're staying at and say,

38:55.640 --> 38:58.632
"Send out the Levite
that we may know him."

38:59.477 --> 39:03.337
Which Zora said means they
want to have sex with him?

39:03.981 --> 39:05.784
Yeah, that's what that means.

39:05.818 --> 39:08.453
But he's scared,
which of course he would be,

39:08.486 --> 39:12.033
so he makes his concubine
go out there instead.

39:12.825 --> 39:17.945
And the men, they, like, attack her.

39:19.665 --> 39:20.938
All night.

39:21.667 --> 39:23.469
And then in the morning, he's so upset,

39:23.502 --> 39:25.638
he kills her and cuts her
into twelve pieces

39:25.671 --> 39:28.057
and sends one to each
of the twelve tribes.

39:29.186 --> 39:30.843
Why is that in the Bible?

39:31.713 --> 39:33.454
I don't know, honey.

39:34.529 --> 39:36.114
I mean, it's so awful.

39:36.147 --> 39:37.482
What's the point?

39:37.515 --> 39:38.873
I don't know,

39:39.444 --> 39:41.787
maybe that sometimes life is awful?

39:42.516 --> 39:44.111
It doesn't say that it was a good thing.

39:44.144 --> 39:45.825
It just said that it happened.

39:46.206 --> 39:49.761
Maybe the point is that sometimes
people do terrible things.

39:53.531 --> 39:55.033
But that isn't the end of the story.

39:55.066 --> 39:56.501
No, it wasn't the end of the story.

39:56.535 --> 39:58.136
After that, there was a war.

39:58.169 --> 39:59.838
Okay, honey. Why don't you
go get dressed, baby?

39:59.872 --> 40:00.855
We're going to be late.

40:01.473 --> 40:04.510
Okay, but I'm just saying...

40:04.542 --> 40:05.845
I know.

40:05.877 --> 40:08.937
There was a war. There was a war.

40:28.566 --> 40:29.868
Pastor Greenleaf?

40:33.972 --> 40:35.874
Hey, honey, I'll meet you inside, okay?

40:35.908 --> 40:37.710
- Is that...
- Yeah.

40:37.743 --> 40:41.647
Save me a seat? This is a surprise.

40:41.680 --> 40:43.883
I thought you'd be
halfway to Delaware by now.

40:43.915 --> 40:45.417
Yeah, well, you got me thinking.

40:45.450 --> 40:47.019
I'm sorry about that.

40:47.051 --> 40:48.921
No, it's a good thing.

40:49.470 --> 40:51.022
For my brother.

40:51.923 --> 40:53.126
Oh, my God!

40:55.127 --> 40:57.093
- David!
- Oh, my God!

40:57.729 --> 40:59.765
David. Somebody get some help!

41:00.865 --> 41:02.434
Get some help!

41:03.167 --> 41:04.903
Get some help!

41:07.234 --> 41:08.806
David, look at me.

00:00.500 --> 00:10.000
