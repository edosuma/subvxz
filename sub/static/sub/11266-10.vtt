Oh.

But Ivy doesn't know
that you and I slept together.

What?!

00:10.719 --> 00:11.804
I'm not gonna
tell anybody

00:11.846 --> 00:13.806

I told you I have stuff

00:26.109 --> 00:28.111
going on at home, stuff that
I wanted to talk to you about?

00:28.153 --> 00:30.364
Guys, can you wait,
like, five minutes?

Don't worry about it.

your ear off last night.

with some guy

01:12.990 --> 01:14.575
sitting on your couch
for four hours,

01:14.616 --> 01:17.578
feeling sorry for himself,

It's too weird.

09:06.380 --> 09:07.422
It's not weird.

09:07.464 --> 09:08.923
Well, just try it.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.842
Well, aren't there all kinds
of predators?

09:11.926 --> 09:13.220
Like, sex predators?

09:13.261 --> 09:15.305
Look, look, we-we will
screen for sex predators.

09:15.347 --> 09:16.806
Come on, Mom.

09:16.848 --> 09:18.350
What do you have to lose?

09:20.852 --> 09:21.978
(sighs)

09:22.020 --> 09:23.855
Okay, you can put up
my profile.
Yes!

09:23.897 --> 09:25.482
Wait, wait, wait.
But I am not

09:25.524 --> 09:26.774
committing
to any dates just yet.

09:26.816 --> 09:27.942
Let's see how it goes.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.236
ANNIE:
That's great.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.445
You know, one step at a time.

09:30.487 --> 09:33.073
So, what do you think
about this picture?

09:33.114 --> 09:34.991
Oh, Dixon, no!
What?!

09:35.033 --> 09:36.910
I'm eating a banana.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.958
Where have you been?
What is it?

09:44.000 --> 09:45.626
I got here as
fast as I could.

09:45.668 --> 09:46.794
What's the big
emergency?

09:46.836 --> 09:48.338
It's about your advance.

09:48.380 --> 09:50.048
Oh, no.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.050
Oh, God, I knew I shouldn't
have spent so much.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.301
They want it back?

09:53.343 --> 09:54.677
They want it all
back, don't they?

09:54.719 --> 09:56.304
They don't want any of it back.

09:56.346 --> 09:57.638
In fact...

09:57.680 --> 09:59.391
What's this?

09:59.433 --> 10:02.477
Your single
is selling so well,

10:02.519 --> 10:04.687
the record company
tripled your advance.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.523
(gasps)
Are you serious?!

10:06.565 --> 10:07.399
Yeah.

10:07.441 --> 10:09.276
Oh, my God!
This is amazing!

10:09.317 --> 10:10.818
No, you're amazing.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.362
And this is only the beginning.

10:12.404 --> 10:15.156
(laughs)
(laughs)

10:39.847 --> 10:42.517
So, what do you
want to do now?

10:42.559 --> 10:45.686
I want to hang out
with my friends.
(gasps) Oh!

10:45.728 --> 10:47.688
We're by that hotel
that wraps foie gras

10:47.730 --> 10:49.816
and cotton candy
and serves it on a stick!

10:49.857 --> 10:50.984
Let's go there for dinner.

10:51.025 --> 10:51.985
Come on, it'll be fun.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.736
No, hanging out
with you is my job.

10:53.778 --> 10:54.821
It's not fun.

10:54.862 --> 10:56.364
Come on,

10:56.406 --> 10:59.451
you can invite your friends,
too, if you want.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.244
I have my mom's credit card.

11:02.870 --> 11:04.623
Would you rather go to a movie?
Enough!

11:04.664 --> 11:06.124
Okay? I-I'm not into you.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.001
I will never be into you.

11:08.042 --> 11:11.296
Just let it
go already.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.047
(sighs)

11:16.176 --> 11:18.886
Take me home.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.851
(sniffles)
I'm sorry.

11:24.892 --> 11:26.853
I... I didn't mean

11:26.894 --> 11:28.729
to make you cry. I...

11:28.771 --> 11:31.149
Please stop.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.985
Look, y-you're...

11:34.027 --> 11:35.320
a great girl.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.447
I just don't feel
that way about you.

11:37.489 --> 11:40.283
Well, I don't feel that
way about you, either.

11:40.325 --> 11:41.742
I tried, but...

11:41.784 --> 11:43.328
I'm still in love
with Dax.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.579
Who's Dax?

11:44.621 --> 11:46.164
What do you care?

11:46.206 --> 11:47.541
Laura, I care.

11:47.582 --> 11:49.959
I... I don't want
to see you cry.

11:51.586 --> 11:54.673
(sniffles)
Dax is my ex.

11:54.713 --> 11:57.967
He's beautiful
and he's tortured.

11:58.009 --> 11:59.260
(sniffles)

11:59.302 --> 12:01.388
He grew up in foster homes,

12:01.429 --> 12:03.806
and he spent six
months in juvie.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.766
He sounds great.
He is.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.602
He's got
Robert Downey Jr.'s soul

12:07.644 --> 12:08.853
and Zac Efron's body.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.273
So, what's the problem?

12:12.315 --> 12:13.941
He dumped me,

12:13.983 --> 12:16.110
because he thought
I was just another

12:16.152 --> 12:17.862
goody-goody Beverly Hills girl.

12:17.904 --> 12:20.615
(sniffles) So I thought
I'd prove him wrong.

12:20.657 --> 12:22.617
By dealing drugs?

12:22.659 --> 12:24.952
Yeah.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.120
It didn't work.

12:26.162 --> 12:27.414
He still hates me.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.457
He won't even return my texts.

12:29.499 --> 12:32.627
(sniffles)
Oh, God, I'm such a loser!

12:33.794 --> 12:35.589
Hey, uh...

12:35.630 --> 12:37.756
hey, c-come on.

12:37.798 --> 12:39.718
(sighs)

12:39.758 --> 12:42.887
Hey, you want to go get that
cotton candy thingy for dinner?

12:42.929 --> 12:44.889
What do you say?
Whatever!

12:44.931 --> 12:46.224
It all just sucks.

12:46.266 --> 12:49.728
I was stupid to think
that you or Dax or anyone

12:49.768 --> 12:51.062
would ever like me.

12:55.609 --> 12:57.485
(door opens)

12:59.571 --> 13:01.448
Hey, babe, how's it going?

13:01.489 --> 13:02.574
Fine.

13:02.616 --> 13:05.660
So, are you psyched
for the surf contest?

13:05.702 --> 13:07.412
Whatever.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.664
Well, win or lose,
I was thinking

13:09.706 --> 13:12.584
we could get oysters after
at Poseidon's Point, like,

13:12.626 --> 13:14.502
you know, we always do--
what do you think?

13:14.544 --> 13:15.920
Yeah, not this time.

13:15.962 --> 13:16.713
Ivy...

13:16.755 --> 13:17.838
What?!

13:22.176 --> 13:23.928
Please, honey...

13:23.970 --> 13:26.431
you know, you're my best friend.

13:26.473 --> 13:29.225
We are not best friends, okay?

13:29.267 --> 13:30.977
You're my mother.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.895
And that sucks for me.

13:40.069 --> 13:42.405
♪ ♪
(silverware clinking on glass)

13:42.447 --> 13:44.198
ADRIANNA: So, I just
wanted to say

13:44.240 --> 13:45.866
I am so excited

13:45.908 --> 13:48.869
to be here with
my best friends in the world.

13:48.911 --> 13:52.123
You guys have been amazing
and supportive,

13:52.165 --> 13:53.832
and I'm just so glad
that you all

13:53.874 --> 13:56.169
get to be a part of my journey.

13:56.210 --> 13:59.422
(laughs) Oh, and no matter
where my career takes me,

13:59.464 --> 14:01.341
I will always remember you guys.

14:01.382 --> 14:02.883
You just can't
understand

14:02.925 --> 14:06.053
how much it means to me
to have normal,

14:06.095 --> 14:07.806
non-famous friends.

14:09.265 --> 14:10.433
I love you all.

14:10.475 --> 14:11.518
Cheers. (laughs)

14:11.559 --> 14:13.060
OTHERS:
Cheers!

14:13.102 --> 14:14.895
ANNIE:
Did she just refer to us

14:14.937 --> 14:16.939
as her "non-famous friends"?
Yeah, she did,

14:16.981 --> 14:19.942
but at least we get to be
a part of her "journey."
Ah, yes.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.695
To Adrianna!
GINNY:
Rihanna and Gaga,

14:21.736 --> 14:23.655
watch your backs, bitches.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.740
(laughter)
Oh, my God,
that's too funny.

14:25.782 --> 14:26.866
You have to tweet that.

14:26.907 --> 14:28.326
You think?
Do it.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.744
(laughing)

14:31.078 --> 14:33.414
Hey, how hot
is your girlfriend?

14:33.456 --> 14:35.667
She's incredible.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.084
Aw...

14:37.126 --> 14:39.420
Someone wants to go
to the Grammys.

14:39.462 --> 14:41.756
(laughs)

14:41.798 --> 14:43.424
ADRIANNA: So, Liam, Dixon,
what's been going on?

14:43.466 --> 14:44.592
I feel like I haven't

14:44.634 --> 14:45.677
seen you in forever.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.136
Catch me up.
Tell me everything.

14:47.178 --> 14:48.137
LIAM:
Uh...

14:48.179 --> 14:49.305
Dixon almost
drowned today.

14:49.347 --> 14:50.390
Whoa, whoa.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.225
Screw you, dude--
I was surfing my ass off.

14:52.266 --> 14:53.476
But you did.
No, no, no, no.

14:53.518 --> 14:55.562
All right, so you guys know
the West Bev Invitational

14:55.603 --> 14:58.606
(ringtone)
is tomorrow,
so we've been...

14:58.648 --> 15:00.900
Oh, my God, Victor,
give it a rest.

15:00.941 --> 15:02.902
He's still pushing for
that Seventeen photo shoot.

15:02.943 --> 15:04.195
Let it go, Victor.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.780
It's not even a cover.

15:05.822 --> 15:06.865
Ade, can you deal
with that later?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.533
Ade.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.159
Hey.
Hey.

15:10.201 --> 15:15.248
So, um, I heard about what
happened between you and Ian.

15:15.289 --> 15:19.335
He told me you apologized
and that you two are cool.

15:19.377 --> 15:20.754
Oh.
(laughs)

15:20.795 --> 15:22.296
Yeah, we're cool.

15:22.338 --> 15:24.340
That's great.
That's so great.

15:24.382 --> 15:26.760
I'm... I'm really
glad you did that.

15:26.801 --> 15:29.512
Well, that's not
really who I am.

15:29.554 --> 15:32.223
You know? I was being
a complete jerk that day.

15:32.265 --> 15:35.476
(whispers): Yeah.
Ian's a good guy.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.938
You coming to the
luau tomorrow?

15:38.979 --> 15:40.981
Uh... maybe, I don't know.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.484
I think you should go;
it's gonna be fun.

15:43.526 --> 15:44.903
(Renee screams)

15:44.944 --> 15:45.904
Oh, my God!

15:45.945 --> 15:47.071
Are you ready for me

15:47.113 --> 15:49.574
to completely
rock your world?

15:49.616 --> 15:52.076
Ashton Kutcher is
following you on Twitter.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.327
Shut up!
Oh, yes.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.830
(laughter)
RENEE:
How cool is that?

15:55.872 --> 15:57.415
ADRIANNA: I'm gonna send
him a direct message.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.751
Thanks again
for lunch, Ade.

15:59.793 --> 16:01.753
Yeah, it was really
fun. (forced laugh)

16:01.795 --> 16:04.338
Oh, thanks, guys.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.715
Paparazzi,
two o'clock.

16:05.757 --> 16:08.384
Ugh! They're such vultures.

16:08.426 --> 16:10.177
I can't believe
they tracked me down.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.763
Hey, sweetie,
can you hold this?

16:11.805 --> 16:13.013
I'll meet you
in the car.

16:13.055 --> 16:13.723
Yeah.

16:16.601 --> 16:19.312
-Adrianna!
-Adrianna! -Smile!

16:19.353 --> 16:20.939
Someone tipped them off.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.608
I can guarantee you
it was one of the waiters.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.610
Waiters? Please!

16:25.652 --> 16:27.737
Adrianna called them herself.

16:27.779 --> 16:29.572
Oh, that girl knows

16:29.614 --> 16:30.907
how to work it.

16:30.949 --> 16:32.909
Adrianna!
Thank you.

16:32.951 --> 16:34.869
(shutters clicking)

16:42.460 --> 16:44.337
Thanks, and keep the change.

16:54.221 --> 16:56.265
Hope you're happy.

16:57.892 --> 16:59.686
You destroyed her.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.354
You know that.
(sighs)

17:01.395 --> 17:02.814
My heart is breaking.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.607
How can you be so cruel?

17:06.275 --> 17:09.569
My mother is dead
because of you.

17:09.612 --> 17:12.615
Look, I... I did
a terrible thing,

17:12.656 --> 17:15.117
and I am truly
sorry about that,

17:15.159 --> 17:17.619
but I didn't intend
to hurt anyone.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.579
I didn't set out
to destroy

17:19.622 --> 17:21.290
your family
like you did with mine.

17:21.332 --> 17:22.750
I had to get even with you.

17:22.791 --> 17:24.292
I wasn't gonna
let you get away

17:24.335 --> 17:25.377
with what you did.

17:25.419 --> 17:28.297
Fine! Get even with me
all you want,

17:28.339 --> 17:30.550
but Ivy did nothing to you!

17:30.591 --> 17:32.468
She doesn't deserve
any of this!

17:32.510 --> 17:35.137
I'm all that Ivy had...

17:35.179 --> 17:37.390
and now she's got no one.

17:40.100 --> 17:42.478
Was that part of your plan, too?

17:58.703 --> 18:00.663
(dialing)

18:00.705 --> 18:02.749
(phone line ringing)

18:02.790 --> 18:03.833
WOMAN:
Hello?

18:05.001 --> 18:06.335
Oh, um...

18:06.377 --> 18:08.713
Hi. I-I was looking for Harry.

18:08.755 --> 18:09.881
Who is this?

18:09.923 --> 18:11.215
This is his wife.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.884
Um... his ex-wife.

18:12.926 --> 18:14.218
Can I take a message?

18:14.260 --> 18:16.637
You know what,
I-I can try him later.

18:16.679 --> 18:17.638
Are you sure?

18:17.680 --> 18:19.057
Yeah. It's okay.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.600
It's-it's-it's fine.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.101
Thank you. Good-bye.

18:22.142 --> 18:23.603
Bye.
(hangs up)

18:25.229 --> 18:27.899
(sighs)

18:27.941 --> 18:30.693
So, how's my online profile?

18:30.735 --> 18:33.279
Any hits?

18:33.320 --> 18:34.864
Uh...

18:34.906 --> 18:36.115
let's check it out.

18:36.156 --> 18:37.491
(beep)

18:37.533 --> 18:39.368
Mom! Whoa!

18:39.410 --> 18:41.412
Are those all for me?

18:41.454 --> 18:43.289
You got 65 responses.

18:43.330 --> 18:44.707
Seriously?

there's Rodeo Drive.

(clears throat)

40:00.398 --> 40:02.317
Need any help?

40:02.359 --> 40:03.651
Yeah, that'd
be great.

40:03.693 --> 40:05.195
Thanks.

40:05.237 --> 40:07.113
Here you go.

Hey, chauffeur boy.

40:44.901 --> 40:46.861
Let me give you
a piece of advice.

40:46.903 --> 40:47.987
Stay away from my girl.

40:49.530 --> 40:50.782
Please.

40:50.823 --> 40:52.367
And people say
you're not polite.

40:52.409 --> 40:54.994
She's not your girl anymore.

40:55.036 --> 40:56.871
You don't know
what you're talking about.

40:58.831 --> 41:01.418
I know she's much better off
without you.

41:02.752 --> 41:04.087
Stay away from her, all right?

41:05.546 --> 41:07.882
I really hate being
told what to do.
