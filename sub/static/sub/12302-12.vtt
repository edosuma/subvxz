WEBVTT

00:29.636 --> 00:30.346
What do you got?

00:30.381 --> 00:31.340
Betty Rockingham.

00:31.375 --> 00:32.264
Car accident.

00:32.299 --> 00:33.806
Was in full arrest upon arrival.

00:34.180 --> 00:35.511
Put her in bay four.

00:37.654 --> 00:39.576
It's gonna be all right.
We're at the hospital now.

00:51.374 --> 00:52.692
Nurse?

00:53.197 --> 00:54.431
Nurse.

00:54.466 --> 00:55.318
I need a nurse.

00:55.353 --> 00:56.640
How long do I gotta wait, man?

00:56.640 --> 00:58.433
Three. One, two, three.

01:24.075 --> 01:25.502
This is for the East Side!

01:38.754 --> 01:40.100
A shootout...

01:40.625 --> 01:41.907
in the E.R.

01:43.601 --> 01:44.564
So...

01:44.599 --> 01:46.252
According to witnesses,this man entered

01:46.287 --> 01:49.207
from the ambulance bay, came
in here and started firing.

01:49.367 --> 01:50.821
And somebody fired back.

01:51.296 --> 01:52.062
Who's that?

01:52.097 --> 01:54.241
Nurse said he admitted
himself this morning

01:54.276 --> 01:55.769
with severe abdominal pain.

01:55.818 --> 01:56.485
Alexx?

01:56.520 --> 01:58.442
It's not the pain he died from, Horatio.

01:59.107 --> 02:00.127
Through and through.

02:00.162 --> 02:01.924
Entered through the left temporal bone,

02:02.047 --> 02:03.649
exited the right parietal.

02:03.969 --> 02:04.862
Horatio?

02:04.897 --> 02:05.756
Yeah?

02:05.781 --> 02:07.284
Our shooter's got some ink.

02:07.444 --> 02:08.725
Tattoo on his neck.

02:11.431 --> 02:12.480
E.S.H.

02:12.515 --> 02:14.067
East Side Hermanos.

02:14.708 --> 02:16.766
So, this is a gang shooting, ladies.

02:17.160 --> 02:18.712
With collateral damage.

02:18.837 --> 02:20.956
Gang shootings usually
go down on the streets,

02:21.018 --> 02:22.693
in their own territories.

02:23.211 --> 02:24.604
This time...

02:25.256 --> 02:26.697
it was in a public place.

02:27.720 --> 02:29.408
Somebody brought the war to us.

02:30.379 --> 02:31.698
Now we...

02:32.412 --> 02:33.792
are gonna take it to them.

03:29.850 --> 03:31.624
Crime scene in an active emergency room.

03:31.649 --> 03:34.113
Got to move quickly. We've
been compromised already.

03:38.756 --> 03:40.087
Excuse me, ma'am?

03:40.407 --> 03:41.799
Hi, I'm Ryan Wolfe, Miami-Dade P.D.

03:41.834 --> 03:43.192
I noticed you've got some blood on you.

03:43.561 --> 03:45.385
Oh, it's... not mine.

03:45.540 --> 03:47.499
The guy with the gun
was standing next to me.

03:47.795 --> 03:48.905
Did you see anything?

03:48.940 --> 03:51.294
I just closed my eyes.
I covered Bethany's ears.

03:51.329 --> 03:52.910
I just wanted it to be over.

03:52.945 --> 03:54.559
Do you mind if I take your sweater?

03:55.157 --> 03:56.783
There might be some
viable evidence on it.

03:57.178 --> 03:58.557
No, not at all.

04:03.683 --> 04:04.952
Thank you.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.306
Miss,

04:06.478 --> 04:07.873
are, uh...you aware

04:08.511 --> 04:10.519
your baby might have some
bruising under her eye?

04:10.679 --> 04:12.589
No, I'm not. Is she okay?

04:12.885 --> 04:14.203
I'm going to find out.

04:14.265 --> 04:15.571
Excuse me, Nurse?

04:25.857 --> 04:27.299
Something's not adding up.

04:30.095 --> 04:32.239
Alexx said his head shot
was a through and through.

04:34.316 --> 04:35.439
What, you don't believe her?

04:35.474 --> 04:37.556
I believe her, but not the evidence.

04:37.950 --> 04:40.427
Look at his head, and then
look at the wall behind him.

04:42.193 --> 04:46.488
There's an exit wound and no
corresponding bullet strike.

04:46.523 --> 04:47.279
What're you thinking?

04:47.314 --> 04:49.531
I'm thinking we've got
our work cut out for us.

04:49.963 --> 04:50.310
All right.

04:50.345 --> 04:51.786
Got an I.D. on the guy.

04:52.045 --> 04:54.102
His name is Hector Del Rio.

04:54.146 --> 04:55.797
Well, we know he's an East Side Hermano.

04:55.822 --> 04:57.191
Who was he targeting?

04:57.460 --> 04:58.754
Calvin Joyner.

04:58.939 --> 05:00.197
Two priors.

05:00.232 --> 05:03.004
Known associates tie him
back to the Ten-Trays.

05:03.049 --> 05:04.379
Ten-Tray?

05:04.700 --> 05:06.659
Is there history between these gangs?

05:06.732 --> 05:08.667
Officially, no reports were filed

05:08.716 --> 05:10.429
but unofficially? I'm sure the gang unit

05:10.464 --> 05:11.895
has something to say about it.

05:12.050 --> 05:13.664
Well, somebody tipped the gunman

05:13.699 --> 05:15.278
that Mr. Joyner was here in the E.R.

05:15.919 --> 05:17.471
Think I can help you with that.

05:18.260 --> 05:19.713
Found this in Hector's pocket.

05:20.514 --> 05:21.783
Hmm.

05:24.055 --> 05:25.632
Last call was made an hour ago.

05:26.026 --> 05:28.552
That's just before the shooting.
I'll see if we can trace the call.

05:28.587 --> 05:30.240
Hold on a second. I got an idea.

05:34.912 --> 05:36.206
Hey!

05:47.451 --> 05:49.114
Do not move.

05:52.423 --> 05:54.715
Quite a busy day at
the office, Mr. Morales

05:55.035 --> 05:56.269
I didn't do anything.

05:56.304 --> 05:57.686
Didn't you alert your gang that

05:57.721 --> 06:00.333
one of your rivals had been
admitted to the hospital?

06:01.010 --> 06:02.316
I'm not in a gang.

06:03.236 --> 06:04.554
Two dead.

06:04.776 --> 06:05.961
Four injured.

06:05.996 --> 06:07.328
A phone call you made

06:07.363 --> 06:09.433
produced quite a hefty body count.

06:10.093 --> 06:11.744
And in my world, that's called

06:11.781 --> 06:13.173
accessory

06:13.518 --> 06:14.849
to felony murder.

06:17.732 --> 06:18.976
Sorry I'm late.

06:18.996 --> 06:21.189
No problem, Frank. I understand that

06:21.645 --> 06:23.259
you and Ramon have some history.

06:23.740 --> 06:26.302
Yeah, I been arresting this
guy since he was about yay high

06:26.697 --> 06:28.040
You're gettin' up there, Ramon.

06:28.232 --> 06:29.612
You out of your teens yet?

06:29.647 --> 06:30.573
Twenty-one.

06:30.967 --> 06:31.706
wow!

06:31.750 --> 06:33.403
We're talking adult
diapers with your crowd.

06:34.045 --> 06:35.432
Congrats on still breathing.

06:35.604 --> 06:36.680
Ramon...

06:36.716 --> 06:38.786
this situation with the Ten-Trays

06:39.106 --> 06:40.511
appears to be escalating.

06:40.893 --> 06:42.618
Built a new highway last year,

06:43.110 --> 06:44.946
straight through the
middle of Tray territory.

06:44.983 --> 06:46.585
So they relocated east...

06:47.001 --> 06:48.333
butting up against E.S.H.

06:48.368 --> 06:50.068
I'll bet that went over
well, Ramon, didn't it?

06:51.399 --> 06:53.567
Oh, I know. You can't talk. Yadda yadda.

06:54.504 --> 06:55.834
I just put out the alert.

06:56.056 --> 06:57.879
I didn't know they
were gonna rush the E.R.

06:58.156 --> 07:00.127
Why would he want to
kill Calvin Joyner, Ramon?

07:00.275 --> 07:01.643
Raton's a murderer.

07:01.753 --> 07:03.133
Bumped off Primero.

07:03.170 --> 07:05.018
That's a cry for "187" man, straight up.

07:05.437 --> 07:07.051
Primero was the top guy at E.S.H.

07:07.347 --> 07:08.727
Bullet in the head?

07:09.010 --> 07:10.747
You ask me, Calvin got off light.

07:11.203 --> 07:12.878
No such luck for you, though.

07:13.531 --> 07:14.757
Frank?

07:14.792 --> 07:15.983
Yeah.

07:16.710 --> 07:18.102
I'll get with the gang unit.

07:18.541 --> 07:20.044
See what they know about
the Primero shooting.

07:20.079 --> 07:21.609
Yes, do that, before the city

07:21.644 --> 07:23.149
becomes a battlefield.

07:30.879 --> 07:32.333
It's okay, sweetie.

07:33.023 --> 07:34.329
There you go.

07:35.006 --> 07:36.583
I checked the admission form.

07:36.768 --> 07:38.785
The woman's name is Pamela Warren.

07:38.820 --> 07:41.136
She brought her daughter in,
said she wouldn't stop crying.

07:42.639 --> 07:44.303
I'm curious. Check out her eyes.

07:45.227 --> 07:46.656
That look like petechiae to you?

07:46.951 --> 07:48.455
Come here... come here.

07:52.169 --> 07:53.463
It does.

07:54.645 --> 07:56.112
What are you thinking?

07:57.684 --> 07:59.138
Something I don't want to.

08:08.658 --> 08:10.901
Can you do a complete
physical, including blood work?

08:10.913 --> 08:12.551
I can do it, but you're
going to have to subpoena

08:12.586 --> 08:13.896
the records if you want the results.

08:13.931 --> 08:16.666
Then do it. I need to know
everything I can about that baby

08:24.843 --> 08:27.246
Calleigh. Thought you'd
still be at the scene.

08:27.722 --> 08:29.656
Delko's holding down
the fort. I can't go any

08:29.668 --> 08:31.590
further until I have
the bullet trajectories.

08:31.948 --> 08:33.488
Then you've come at a good time.

08:33.870 --> 08:35.619
First, I give you our shooter.

08:35.730 --> 08:37.085
Hector Del Rio.

08:37.452 --> 08:39.780
Two entry wounds, two rounds recovered,

08:40.224 --> 08:42.503
both measuring 30
degrees above horizontal.

08:42.933 --> 08:44.869
So, Hector was hit at an upward angle,

08:45.041 --> 08:46.606
consistent with the
theory that Calvin was

08:46.641 --> 08:48.195
still lying in bed when he shot him.

08:51.751 --> 08:52.948
Calvin...

08:52.983 --> 08:54.473
now that's the interesting one.

08:55.570 --> 08:57.430
I told you about the
bullet that killed him.

08:58.164 --> 08:59.618
How about the one that didn't?

08:59.653 --> 09:00.924
What do you mean?

09:02.797 --> 09:04.842
But that wound didn't
have time to scab over.

09:05.231 --> 09:07.301
No, it didn't. Fluoroscope picked it up.

09:07.486 --> 09:08.890
It's preexisting.

09:08.976 --> 09:10.615
Are you saying that he was shot recently

09:10.650 --> 09:12.192
but didn't have the bullet removed?

09:12.475 --> 09:14.163
See it a lot with gang members.

09:14.626 --> 09:16.757
Won't hit a hospital
unless they have to.

09:17.275 --> 09:19.530
Mandatory police notification.

09:20.195 --> 09:21.624
Horatio's going to want that bullet.

09:35.412 --> 09:36.646
Thanks, Alexx. Now

09:36.681 --> 09:38.233
I've got my own bullets to deal with.

09:45.600 --> 09:46.918
Okay, so...

09:48.150 --> 09:49.469
here we go.

09:50.331 --> 09:51.343
We got

09:51.378 --> 09:53.448
Calvin Joyner in bay five.

09:54.639 --> 09:57.509
And Hector Del Rio, our initial shooter.

09:58.273 --> 09:59.727
So, we're going to work backwards

09:59.762 --> 10:01.181
from the bullet hits in the wall.

10:10.135 --> 10:12.020
And all of those trace back to Hector.

10:16.915 --> 10:19.121
Now we'll follow the
shots from the other side.

10:24.770 --> 10:26.926
They lead back to Calvin on the gurney.

10:32.803 --> 10:34.774
So, we got four shots in the wall,

10:34.936 --> 10:36.463
none killed Calvin,

10:36.710 --> 10:38.127
we got one more to check out.

10:43.942 --> 10:45.211
Whoa.

10:46.788 --> 10:48.784
This is weird. The trajectory's off.

10:48.870 --> 10:50.300
It points straight to the ground.

10:50.335 --> 10:51.829
Yeah, that should be the

10:51.864 --> 10:53.429
through and through to Calvin's head.

10:56.788 --> 10:58.217
You thinking what I'm thinking?

10:58.463 --> 10:59.623
Ricochet.

10:59.658 --> 11:02.135
That's why there was no
corresponding bullet hole in the wall.

11:02.258 --> 11:03.539
Yeah.

11:04.261 --> 11:06.479
A lot of equipment got moved
around after the shooting.

11:09.892 --> 11:11.222
Voids.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.699
There was something on
the ground behind him.

11:24.629 --> 11:25.986
I got it.

11:37.486 --> 11:38.792
It matches right up.

11:39.420 --> 11:40.814
After it went through his head,

11:40.849 --> 11:42.746
the bullet deflected
off the x-ray machine.

11:43.510 --> 11:44.890
It made an indentation.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.405
It's called "pinch point. "

11:48.479 --> 11:50.906
Bullet bounced off the metal,
giving us directionality.

11:54.183 --> 11:56.179
Will you put the mirror
on top of the indentation?

12:07.922 --> 12:09.204
Check it out.

12:11.668 --> 12:13.245
Its origin is by the entrance.

12:14.243 --> 12:15.598
Hector never even hit him.

12:15.647 --> 12:17.027
We've got a second shooter.

12:18.695 --> 12:20.013
It's the killer.

12:21.257 --> 12:22.650
And he's still out there.

12:35.778 --> 12:37.898
The second shooter was
standing right here.

12:38.316 --> 12:40.854
That's quite a shot. He hit
Calvin from across the room.

12:41.783 --> 12:43.273
Must have been a backup guy.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.156
The first gunman started
shooting, not expecting

12:46.191 --> 12:48.115
his target to have a weapon.

12:48.189 --> 12:50.468
Supposed to be an execution.
Turned into a shootout.

12:59.721 --> 13:01.667
Then after everything went
south, the second gunman

13:01.675 --> 13:03.720
would've had to get
out of here really fast.

13:04.151 --> 13:05.544
Must be a getaway car.

13:10.417 --> 13:12.327
Got tire treads that look fresh.

13:13.079 --> 13:14.717
They end right there,at the curb.

13:15.383 --> 13:17.440
So the car peeled out really fast,

13:17.475 --> 13:18.746
then hit the curb.

13:22.141 --> 13:23.460
A piece of metal.

13:24.433 --> 13:27.353
Smooth, has some sort of design on it.

13:28.092 --> 13:29.410
Could be from a dub.

13:29.445 --> 13:30.406
A what?

13:30.441 --> 13:31.367
A dub.

13:31.626 --> 13:33.018
You know, spinners.

13:33.141 --> 13:34.400
Spinners?

13:34.435 --> 13:36.960
A tricked-out tire rim
that has a extra piece

13:36.995 --> 13:38.796
on it that spins on the outside.

13:39.321 --> 13:40.738
Oh, a hubcap.

13:40.972 --> 13:42.426
Yeah, something like that.

13:42.968 --> 13:44.582
Probably broke off when he pulled out.

13:48.631 --> 13:50.257
You think we can track it to the driver?

13:50.479 --> 13:51.920
Yeah, these things are
pretty high-end. There are not

13:51.955 --> 13:53.596
too many manufacturers.

13:54.052 --> 13:55.518
We just gotta find out
what kind of metal it is.

13:55.974 --> 13:57.489
Track the dub, find the shooter.

14:39.906 --> 14:41.571
We're investigating a
homicide, Mr. Davids.

14:41.606 --> 14:43.725
We have a piece of metal that
may have come from the shop.

14:44.883 --> 14:46.608
The highest grade
aluminum on the market.

14:47.397 --> 14:49.750
Polished grade finish, top of the line.

14:50.728 --> 14:53.056
It's nice. Bet a lot of people
come here for your art,right?

14:53.253 --> 14:54.756
It's off the chain, ain't it, man?

14:55.459 --> 14:56.937
We've got this aluminum piece.

14:57.319 --> 14:58.847
Like to know what design it comes from.

14:59.549 --> 15:00.904
You said homicide?

15:01.514 --> 15:03.178
We're just looking to locate a driver.

15:03.521 --> 15:07.089
Sick dub deuce like that
gets me, like, ten grand.

15:07.124 --> 15:09.982
I'd rather not mess with my client
base, if you know what I mean.

15:10.017 --> 15:12.410
I imagine most of your "client
base" aren't Boy Scouts.

15:12.445 --> 15:13.738
Probably pay in cash.

15:13.773 --> 15:16.526
So, uh, I don't know I
should start an investigation,

15:16.561 --> 15:18.317
maybe make a call to the IRS...

15:18.352 --> 15:19.169
You know what I mean?

15:19.204 --> 15:21.350
Maybe I can give you a name.

15:23.475 --> 15:24.529
Jesse.

15:24.928 --> 15:26.352
Jesse Navedo.

15:27.361 --> 15:29.457
I hear you like to spend
a lot of money on your car.

15:30.291 --> 15:31.461
So?

15:31.496 --> 15:35.569
Busted rim on the right front tire was
recently found outside a crime scene.

15:36.516 --> 15:37.731
And?

15:37.766 --> 15:39.549
And you're looking really
good for murder one.

15:39.584 --> 15:40.741
Right.

15:40.776 --> 15:43.875
Why don't you tell me why you
happened to be in the ambulance

15:43.876 --> 15:46.975
bay of Dade Memorial Hospital at
the same time of a gang shooting.

15:47.782 --> 15:49.953
Dade... Dade...

15:49.988 --> 15:51.588
Yeah, I was there.

15:51.623 --> 15:52.805
Late last night.

15:52.840 --> 15:54.396
Partied with some huera.

15:54.431 --> 15:56.660
She went all crazy, started shaking.

15:56.695 --> 15:57.794
You left pretty quick.

15:57.829 --> 16:01.155
Quick enough to leave your treads
behind and ding the curb on the way out.

16:01.695 --> 16:03.074
She was jailbait.

16:03.109 --> 16:04.625
Dumped her ass off.

16:04.660 --> 16:06.033
Didn't need the grief.

16:07.412 --> 16:09.157
We'll verify your story.

16:09.853 --> 16:11.189
Then do it.

16:14.436 --> 16:15.757
I'll see you again.

16:23.663 --> 16:25.185
Ma'am, what'd you get?

16:25.220 --> 16:27.476
Hey. Driver wouldn't give it up.

16:27.511 --> 16:28.892
He threw out a hinky alibi.

16:28.927 --> 16:30.315
We're checking on it now.

16:30.945 --> 16:31.858
Wasn't there...

16:32.899 --> 16:34.689
wasn't there a woman in the ER

16:34.724 --> 16:36.944
that was about to give birth
at the time of the shooting?

16:36.947 --> 16:38.230
I heard about that.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.284
She went into delivery
right after we got there.

16:40.319 --> 16:43.976
And as I recall, she and her
husband had a brand-new baby boy.

16:44.872 --> 16:48.494
And what husband doesn't videotape
the arrival of his new baby?

16:52.402 --> 16:54.810
Can you fast-forward to
just before the shooting?

16:55.108 --> 16:56.262
Sure.

16:58.522 --> 16:59.701
<i>This is for the East Side!</i>

16:59.736 --> 17:00.881
<i>Please don't shoot!</i>

17:12.172 --> 17:13.676
The video didn't show much.

17:14.828 --> 17:15.771
Did you get what you needed?

17:15.807 --> 17:16.691
Not quite.

17:16.726 --> 17:20.432
Would you show me just the audio track
and would you isolate the last ten seconds?

17:20.467 --> 17:22.934
Sure. No problem.

17:28.336 --> 17:29.536
<i>This is for the East Side!</i>

17:29.571 --> 17:30.729
<i>Please don't shoot!</i>

17:38.509 --> 17:40.670
Driver said he wasn't there
at the time of the shooting,

17:40.705 --> 17:42.685
yet we just heard him
break his rim on the curb.

17:42.720 --> 17:44.447
Thank you, Tyler.

17:44.482 --> 17:45.957
You just gave us enough for a warrant.

17:57.405 --> 17:59.072
Definitely our getaway car.

18:07.487 --> 18:09.088
He paid ten grand for dubs.

18:09.123 --> 18:10.829
I guess you'd want to
keep your car clean.

18:10.864 --> 18:12.219
There's nothing over here.

18:16.295 --> 18:17.378
Wait a minute.

18:17.413 --> 18:18.368
I've got something.

18:18.867 --> 18:20.523
Sunflower seeds.

18:20.558 --> 18:22.329
Look like they're still moist.

18:22.364 --> 18:25.313
So whoever spit them out was
recently in the passenger seat.

18:50.512 --> 18:51.599
We got a floor safe.

18:53.224 --> 18:55.120
So much for a clean car.

19:12.479 --> 19:13.465
Gun.

19:22.463 --> 19:23.313
Miss.

19:23.581 --> 19:25.694
Officer, I-I don't
understand why I'm here.

19:25.729 --> 19:26.471
Where is Bethany?

19:26.506 --> 19:28.012
She's in protective custody.

19:28.047 --> 19:29.293
Protective custody?

19:29.328 --> 19:30.176
What for?

19:30.211 --> 19:32.180
I found numerous fibers in her mouth,

19:32.215 --> 19:35.075
as well as physical signs
of attempted suffocation.

19:36.660 --> 19:38.010
Do you know anything about that?

19:38.045 --> 19:39.064
No.

19:39.099 --> 19:40.667
You don't think I...

19:43.958 --> 19:47.055
When the shooting happened, I-I...

19:47.090 --> 19:49.527
I held her to my chest to protect her.

19:54.578 --> 19:56.707
Oh, if I hurt her in any way...

19:56.742 --> 19:59.006
I'm going to check your
sweater for fiber transfer

19:59.041 --> 20:00.919
and anything you have
in that diaper bag.

20:00.954 --> 20:02.936
Sure. Whatever you need.

21:08.438 --> 21:09.659
She lied.

21:11.690 --> 21:13.750
Valera, how'd it go
on my sunflower seeds?

21:13.785 --> 21:16.508
Surfaces you're giving me keep
getting smaller and smaller.

21:18.237 --> 21:20.269
P.D. recently did some gang sweeps.

21:20.304 --> 21:23.829
They confiscated firearms and put
two dozen new citizens into CODIS,

21:23.864 --> 21:26.912
including a man with a
love of salty snack foods.

21:29.192 --> 21:30.360
Rico Dominguez.

21:31.899 --> 21:34.875
Look, man, I don't know what you guys are
all going on about, you know what I mean?

21:35.209 --> 21:39.219
We know that your partner Hector
attempted to kill Calvin in the ER.

21:40.221 --> 21:43.123
I want to know if you finished the job.

21:43.158 --> 21:44.882
You like sunflower seeds, Rico?

21:51.390 --> 21:53.669
We also found a nine millimeter pistol

21:53.704 --> 21:55.443
that was hidden in a
safe under the seat.

21:55.478 --> 21:57.596
The same gun, Rico, that killed Calvin.

22:04.038 --> 22:05.976
Aw, man! They're shooting back.

22:12.785 --> 22:14.717
Okay, that's cool.

22:14.752 --> 22:15.947
You got me!

22:16.799 --> 22:17.919
You know what I mean?

22:17.954 --> 22:20.488
Why don't you go out and build
up my street cred, homeboy?

22:21.549 --> 22:23.293
So you're admitting you killed Calvin.

22:23.328 --> 22:24.957
It's my homeboy Hector,
you know what I mean?

22:24.992 --> 22:27.004
He wanted a chance, just got jumped in.

22:27.703 --> 22:29.208
He wanted his first.

22:29.243 --> 22:30.391
I said go ahead.

22:30.426 --> 22:32.167
Unfortunately, homeboy was a bad shot.

22:32.202 --> 22:34.294
I took a murderer off the streets, man.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.618
Just like you do.

22:35.653 --> 22:36.861
Case closed, that's it.

22:36.896 --> 22:38.299
How civic-minded of you.

22:38.334 --> 22:39.738
Wasn't your right.

22:40.448 --> 22:42.129
We would have found the guy.

22:42.164 --> 22:44.234
Oh, yeah? When?

22:44.984 --> 22:47.008
You guys are too busy kicking back, man.

22:47.043 --> 22:50.127
Just hoping that we kill each other,
just do all your work for you, huh?

22:50.162 --> 22:52.086
Making it a little easier that way.

22:52.690 --> 22:54.798
You tell me, what'd you
do when Primero got wasted?

22:54.833 --> 22:55.676
Nothing!

22:55.711 --> 22:57.800
Guys in suits walking the onceover,

22:57.835 --> 22:59.312
writing it off as a drive-by!

22:59.347 --> 23:01.008
The investigation is ongoing.

23:01.685 --> 23:02.644
Yeah, I know.

23:02.679 --> 23:05.216
Primero bought it about a month
ago, right there on his front lawn.

23:05.251 --> 23:06.177
One bullet.

23:06.306 --> 23:09.363
One bullet killed him, and you tell
me that sounds like a drive-by?!

23:09.398 --> 23:13.045
It doesn't, but that doesn't absolve
you of your responsibility either.

23:14.442 --> 23:15.579
That's so typical, man.

23:16.101 --> 23:17.951
I knew you'd put this on us.

23:18.419 --> 23:20.540
Why don't you look me in the
eyes and tell me you care.

23:20.845 --> 23:23.386
Why don't you tell me you actually
begin to give a damn, homie!

23:24.122 --> 23:26.060
I'm going to do more than that.

23:38.706 --> 23:39.626
Pamela,

23:40.148 --> 23:42.459
the fibers in Bethany's mouth
aren't from your sweater.

23:42.494 --> 23:45.134
They're from her blanket,
which was in the diaper bag.

23:45.662 --> 23:47.222
I don't know what you mean by that.

23:47.762 --> 23:49.407
It means you lied.

23:52.729 --> 23:54.514
You didn't shield her in your sweater.

23:56.622 --> 23:58.822
You tried to suffocate
her with her blanket.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.848
Not during the shootout.
Sometime before.

24:03.766 --> 24:07.020
All I can tell you is I would
never do anything to hurt my baby.

24:09.802 --> 24:11.802
Um, I brought a bandage.

24:11.837 --> 24:13.530
I'm just a little
worried about that leg.

24:13.565 --> 24:16.379
What? Oh, I'm fine.

24:16.414 --> 24:17.644
No, just let me.

24:21.635 --> 24:23.340
Where's Bethany? Can I see her?

24:23.375 --> 24:25.502
Running some tests.

24:25.537 --> 24:27.389
You sit tight.

24:30.046 --> 24:31.659
I'll make sure she's okay.

24:35.041 --> 24:37.322
This the old bullet from
Calvin Joiner's body?

24:37.357 --> 24:39.186
Just got an IBIS hit.

24:39.221 --> 24:40.091
An IBIS hit?

24:40.126 --> 24:41.778
That's rare for a gang weapon.

24:41.813 --> 24:46.741
Gang sweeps over the last couple of months
have added over 50 firearms to the database.

24:46.776 --> 24:49.868
I'm just cross-referencing
with the arrest log.

24:49.903 --> 24:51.472
So far, nothing.

24:53.764 --> 24:54.616
Nothing...

24:54.902 --> 24:56.096
Something.

24:56.314 --> 24:57.572
Look who it is.

24:57.957 --> 24:59.718
The ER orderly.

25:00.274 --> 25:03.657
Look, I already copped to making
the phone call, but that's all I did.

25:03.692 --> 25:06.042
Ramon, you did more than that.

25:06.077 --> 25:07.499
You shot Calvin.

25:07.958 --> 25:11.736
We know that because we retrieved
a weapon from a gang sweep

25:12.355 --> 25:14.220
that has been attributed to you.

25:14.255 --> 25:15.562
Here's what I think happened.

25:16.095 --> 25:19.855
I think you shot Calvin in an
attempt to avenge Primero's death.

25:31.228 --> 25:33.112
You did not kill Calvin.

25:33.636 --> 25:35.262
You thought all was forgotten,

25:35.297 --> 25:36.323
and then suddenly,

25:36.358 --> 25:38.470
Calvin appears in the ER.

25:39.857 --> 25:40.746
Nurse.

25:40.781 --> 25:41.760
I need a nurse.

25:41.795 --> 25:42.951
How long I got to wait, man?

25:44.004 --> 25:45.548
What's that got to do with me?

25:46.079 --> 25:47.001
Well, you knew

25:47.036 --> 25:50.369
that once we removed the bullet
from Calvin, we could I.D. you.

25:51.367 --> 25:52.817
Wasn't worried about you.

25:53.572 --> 25:55.158
The Ten Trays get onto me,

25:55.193 --> 25:56.619
lights out. I'm a dead man.

25:56.654 --> 25:59.830
Ramon, something is not adding up.

25:59.865 --> 26:01.413
Yeah? What's that?

26:01.458 --> 26:04.899
Calvin was in jail the
night Primero was killed.

26:06.034 --> 26:06.987
That punk claimed it.

26:07.022 --> 26:08.403
You shot the wrong man.

26:14.545 --> 26:16.211
One of theirs for one of ours.

26:17.166 --> 26:19.150
Why don't you just
let it die with Calvin?

26:19.185 --> 26:22.813
Because the real killer
is still out there.

26:25.243 --> 26:28.037
Primero was gunned down in
his own yard about a month ago.

26:29.071 --> 26:30.329
Any witnesses?

26:30.389 --> 26:32.471
Yeah, Primero's little girl, Carmen.

26:32.506 --> 26:33.389
She was on the porch.

26:38.931 --> 26:39.965
Did she see anything?

26:40.000 --> 26:41.340
Not that she told Homicide.

26:41.504 --> 26:44.385
His wife Ana was found beaten
unconscious in the bedroom.

26:48.148 --> 26:49.045
It's all in here.

26:49.080 --> 26:51.722
So he was shot outside
and she was beaten inside.

26:51.757 --> 26:53.538
That doesn't sound gang-related, Frank.

26:53.573 --> 26:54.701
It is now.

26:54.736 --> 26:57.368
Word is they're arming
themselves and nobody's talking.

26:57.403 --> 26:59.078
Let's go change the wife's mind.

27:16.168 --> 27:17.641
Jesse, what are you doing here?

27:18.320 --> 27:21.089
I stepped up after Primero died.

27:21.124 --> 27:22.632
Ana's with me now.

27:22.667 --> 27:23.775
We've been looking for you.

27:24.010 --> 27:26.280
Kind of hard to find a
guy with a fake address.

27:26.315 --> 27:28.248
Yeah? Well, now I live here.

27:28.283 --> 27:29.121
Not anymore.

27:29.156 --> 27:30.012
Yeah? Why's that?

27:30.047 --> 27:31.444
I didn't do anything wrong.

27:31.479 --> 27:32.992
How about felony murder, my friend?

27:33.027 --> 27:33.928
You drove the car.

27:35.123 --> 27:36.534
Can you come out here, please?

27:37.976 --> 27:38.850
Officer.

27:42.150 --> 27:43.120
Can I help you?

27:43.155 --> 27:46.109
Miss Garcia, I'm Detective Tripp
and this is Lieutenant Caine.

27:46.689 --> 27:48.810
We'd like to talk about
your husband's murder, ma'am.

27:49.542 --> 27:50.749
Okay. Talk.

27:50.784 --> 27:51.900
Okay. Could we come in?

27:59.534 --> 28:00.887
You want to tell us what happened?

28:00.922 --> 28:01.663
What?

28:01.698 --> 28:03.945
Primero was a good man.

28:03.980 --> 28:06.739
He never raised his
hand to me or Carmen.

28:07.344 --> 28:09.081
This picture says different.

28:10.740 --> 28:13.759
I'd forgotten dinner that night.

28:13.794 --> 28:15.836
I was making the bed when he got home.

28:15.871 --> 28:17.205
He must have had a bad day.

28:19.073 --> 28:20.654
Ana, where's my food?

28:20.689 --> 28:22.109
Primero, I'm sorry.

28:22.144 --> 28:24.048
I just... I lost track of time.

28:25.020 --> 28:26.228
He was my life.

28:27.253 --> 28:28.294
What about Jesse?

28:28.329 --> 28:30.510
He was here pretty quick
to pick up the pieces.

28:31.156 --> 28:32.526
The East Side way.

28:32.746 --> 28:34.804
Miss Garcia, do you
have a gun in the house?

28:35.737 --> 28:37.185
It was my husband's.

28:37.759 --> 28:38.779
We'd like to see it, please.

28:41.347 --> 28:42.510
Follow me.

28:46.233 --> 28:50.218
Mrs. Garcia, is that Carmen?

28:51.856 --> 28:52.990
Yeah. Why?

28:53.025 --> 28:54.663
Could I speak to her for a minute?

28:56.305 --> 28:57.425
Go ahead.

28:57.460 --> 28:58.557
Thank you.

29:07.131 --> 29:08.078
Hi.

29:09.550 --> 29:10.755
Is your name Carmen?

29:10.904 --> 29:12.017
Yes.

29:12.910 --> 29:14.478
My name's Horatio, Carmen.

29:15.089 --> 29:18.581
And I'm trying to find out who
might want to hurt your dad.

29:20.879 --> 29:22.486
My mom will get mad.

29:23.320 --> 29:24.552
All right, um...

29:24.587 --> 29:25.784
I'll tell you what.

29:25.819 --> 29:27.121
Why don't you let me

29:27.449 --> 29:29.497
worry about mom right now,

29:29.532 --> 29:30.379
all right?

29:30.414 --> 29:31.167
Okay.

29:31.202 --> 29:32.208
Good.

29:32.842 --> 29:34.730
The night your dad got hurt,

29:34.765 --> 29:36.730
you were on the porch.

29:36.911 --> 29:39.581
And I want to know if you saw anything.

29:41.927 --> 29:43.185
I saw fire.

29:44.132 --> 29:45.565
You saw fire?

29:46.002 --> 29:47.451
What kind of fire?

29:49.006 --> 29:50.880
Just... fire.

29:53.191 --> 29:54.369
Horatio.

29:54.404 --> 29:55.232
Yeah?

29:55.267 --> 29:57.040
I got the gun.

29:59.088 --> 30:00.441
Two shots!

30:37.848 --> 30:40.090
What have you got?

30:40.127 --> 30:43.985
Why would Ana Garcia willingly
give us the murder weapon?

30:44.184 --> 30:47.533
Either she doesn't know
or she's a great actress.

30:48.154 --> 30:49.750
She claims she was just making the bed.

30:50.111 --> 30:52.343
Well, I guess now she's
going to have to lie in it.

30:52.962 --> 30:54.673
So where'd you get the gun, Ana?

30:54.850 --> 30:56.981
I told you, it was Primero's.

30:57.127 --> 31:00.185
We checked with Homicide. There
was no gun found that night.

31:00.719 --> 31:04.498
Ana, this is the gun
that killed your husband.

31:05.085 --> 31:07.933
What? No. That's, that's not impossible.

31:08.064 --> 31:11.144
It's true. And I want
to know where you got it.

31:12.577 --> 31:18.040
At the bodega. I needed
it for protection.

31:19.796 --> 31:23.566
This is very provocative clothing.

31:23.965 --> 31:25.157
Were you really doing housework,

31:25.185 --> 31:26.576
or were you doing something else?

31:27.702 --> 31:28.862
Who else was there?

31:29.658 --> 31:30.693
No one.

31:30.839 --> 31:33.224
Okay, Ana, either you shot your husband

31:33.259 --> 31:35.609
or you know who did, so which is it?

31:39.143 --> 31:40.238
I can't say.

31:40.340 --> 31:44.642
Ana, you are being set up. That's
why you were passed the murder weapon.

31:44.845 --> 31:47.706
I fear for my daughter.

31:48.141 --> 31:50.457
So let me help you.

31:51.519 --> 31:53.744
I don't need your help.

31:54.743 --> 31:55.720
Jesse,

31:55.856 --> 31:59.806
you stood to gain quite a bit
with Primero out of the way, right?

32:00.047 --> 32:01.790
Yeah? Like what?

32:01.993 --> 32:03.952
Like his wife, for starters.

32:04.179 --> 32:05.541
You can't pin it on me.

32:05.608 --> 32:08.162
Jesse, are you going to
let Ana take the fall?

32:08.972 --> 32:10.108
She's not talking.

32:11.186 --> 32:12.757
She's a smart girl.

32:13.807 --> 32:15.643
How smart are you?

32:31.811 --> 32:32.817
Hey, you rang?

32:33.009 --> 32:35.197
Got the DNA results you asked for.

32:35.504 --> 32:36.665
The infant case?

32:36.700 --> 32:37.835
Yeah, thanks, Valera.

32:45.456 --> 32:46.355
Problem?

32:46.619 --> 32:47.347
Yeah.

32:48.277 --> 32:50.215
Sometimes, you just want to be wrong.

33:04.234 --> 33:06.022
Can I see my baby now?

33:06.154 --> 33:07.100
Your baby?

33:08.167 --> 33:11.107
I ran your DNA. She's not your child.

33:14.175 --> 33:16.454
I guess you weren't really
concerned about my leg.

33:16.632 --> 33:18.819
I checked the Missing Persons database.

33:18.952 --> 33:21.978
There's no babies reported
missing in the last couple of days.

33:23.594 --> 33:25.372
Did you kidnap her from out of state?

33:25.701 --> 33:27.382
I didn't kidnap her.

33:27.549 --> 33:28.952
I'm her nanny.

33:36.894 --> 33:37.957
What's her real name?

33:38.187 --> 33:39.619
Bethany Seaborne.

33:39.866 --> 33:41.956
And if her parents
cared about her at all,

33:41.991 --> 33:45.056
don't you think that they would
have reported her missing by now?

33:45.064 --> 33:46.981
Is that why you took her?
To teach them a lesson?

33:47.270 --> 33:48.748
I'm her day nanny.

33:49.462 --> 33:52.102
I noticed right off
Bethany cried all the time.

33:52.128 --> 33:53.204
That's what babies do.

33:53.229 --> 33:54.227
Not like this.

33:54.812 --> 33:57.057
She never got any physical
contact from her parents.

33:57.058 --> 33:59.417
I was worried it was
affecting her development.

34:00.035 --> 34:02.044
Nurse said she's in
perfect physical condition.

34:02.158 --> 34:03.573
How about emotional?

34:04.269 --> 34:05.407
Every shift change,

34:05.431 --> 34:06.308
Mrs. Seaborne,

34:06.328 --> 34:08.884
she'd watch me hand
Bethany to the night nanny.

34:08.946 --> 34:12.038
She oversaw it like it
was a business transaction.

34:12.072 --> 34:14.188
Never cuddled her, never talked to her.

34:14.291 --> 34:15.251
So you snuck her out.

34:15.253 --> 34:17.583
You covered her mouth with a
blanket to muffle the crying.

34:29.545 --> 34:31.688
I didn't mean to hold
the blanket that tight.

34:31.705 --> 34:32.966
You have to believe me.

34:34.063 --> 34:35.641
You're lucky Bethany's healthy.

34:36.752 --> 34:38.014
I'm in trouble, aren't I?

34:39.266 --> 34:40.940
I got to go call the Seabornes.

34:44.408 --> 34:45.887
This officer will stay with you.

34:57.693 --> 34:59.614
Eric, what do we have?

34:59.814 --> 35:02.630
Well, I've been reading
through Primero's file.

35:03.367 --> 35:04.219
No follow-up.

35:04.812 --> 35:06.405
Got treated like a traffic incident.

35:06.441 --> 35:09.104
So we agree that it
deserves a deeper look.

35:09.177 --> 35:09.658
Yeah.

35:10.203 --> 35:11.469
Say what you will but,

35:11.858 --> 35:13.626
the man was a community leader.

35:14.119 --> 35:16.052
Just because it's a
community we don't support

35:16.057 --> 35:17.253
doesn't change the fact.

35:17.659 --> 35:21.841
So we also agree that Primero
ruled by fear and not violence.

35:22.235 --> 35:24.372
What made him hit his
wife the night he died?

35:25.408 --> 35:27.702
Look at that bruising
- that's not from a fist.

35:29.751 --> 35:32.389
No. So that means it's something else.

35:32.517 --> 35:33.608
Exactly. What?

35:34.996 --> 35:36.863
Whatever it was, Eric,

35:37.244 --> 35:40.856
it may have left an impression
on this bedpost right here.

35:41.443 --> 35:42.892
Go take a look.

35:45.232 --> 35:47.391
Shouldn't you be looking outside?

35:47.743 --> 35:48.779
I already did.

35:49.122 --> 35:50.140
Besides,

35:50.757 --> 35:52.406
I'm pretty sure the crime started here.

36:22.275 --> 36:23.787
Anything else you want to tell me?

36:25.246 --> 36:26.590
I can't help you.

36:32.762 --> 36:33.438
What'd you get?

36:33.540 --> 36:34.755
The weapon used to hit Ana

36:34.790 --> 36:36.660
left an impression on the bedpost.

36:36.974 --> 36:39.208
I already cast it and
sent the sample to trace.

36:39.243 --> 36:40.890
I just need to define the image.

36:44.514 --> 36:45.235
There it is.

36:46.190 --> 36:47.578
It's kind of hard to make out.

36:47.843 --> 36:49.514
Could it be from a sole of a shoe?

36:50.119 --> 36:50.555
I don't know.

36:50.569 --> 36:51.691
Whatever it is,

36:51.707 --> 36:52.973
it should be here somewhere.

36:53.058 --> 36:55.280
This was everything collected
from the night of the murder.

36:55.341 --> 36:56.475
Well, let's dive in.

37:26.686 --> 37:28.916
There's nothing on
this table that matches.

37:29.610 --> 37:32.675
Which means that it's probably
from the other man in Ana's life.

37:37.503 --> 37:40.238
The impression was from the
side of the bedpost, right?

37:40.624 --> 37:42.749
So we could be looking at a partial.

37:43.374 --> 37:44.815
I'll extrapolate the image.

37:52.639 --> 37:54.788
Hmm. Look familiar?

37:54.888 --> 37:56.062
I'll call Horatio.

38:00.062 --> 38:02.687
You take a great deal of pride
in that logo, don't you, Eddie?

38:03.294 --> 38:05.413
The same way you feel about that badge.

38:05.888 --> 38:06.886
What of it, man?

38:07.655 --> 38:11.232
We found the impression of your
belt buckle in Ana's bedpost.

38:11.607 --> 38:12.870
You can't tell it's mine.

38:13.413 --> 38:14.419
Actually, I can.

38:14.423 --> 38:16.969
The grade of the aluminum's
the highest available

38:16.970 --> 38:18.831
and you're the only one using it.

38:20.330 --> 38:22.727
Okay. Okay, fine.

38:24.018 --> 38:25.065
But I never hit Ana.

38:25.380 --> 38:26.445
No, you didn't,

38:26.459 --> 38:28.577
but you did kill her husband, Eddie.

38:29.121 --> 38:30.480
We checked your records

38:30.491 --> 38:33.733
and you were at Primero's house
that day working on his car.

38:34.585 --> 38:35.894
And you were with Ana

38:36.380 --> 38:37.461
when he came home.

38:45.686 --> 38:47.025
Hey, hey, stop.

38:47.617 --> 38:49.560
It's Primero. Go!

38:51.516 --> 38:53.032
While Ana stalled,

38:53.269 --> 38:54.262
you got dressed.

38:54.907 --> 38:56.987
I know he's hiding here somewhere.

38:56.991 --> 38:58.310
Where is he, Ana?

38:58.335 --> 38:59.686
Ana, where is he?

38:59.707 --> 39:02.192
Hey, that's a real sweet story.

39:03.048 --> 39:03.976
It gets better.

39:05.516 --> 39:06.818
You climbed out the window,

39:06.977 --> 39:08.271
but you forgot your belt.

39:08.716 --> 39:10.010
Is he in the bedroom?

39:10.258 --> 39:11.368
Where is he?

39:11.748 --> 39:13.766
There is nothing going on.

39:13.801 --> 39:14.685
I swear.

39:14.689 --> 39:15.992
Ana, don't lie to me.

39:15.996 --> 39:17.472
There was a man in here.

39:20.533 --> 39:21.349
Eddie?

39:22.480 --> 39:23.635
That's who was here?

39:23.644 --> 39:25.126
It's not what you think.

39:25.141 --> 39:26.216
In my bed?

39:33.648 --> 39:36.258
Outside, you waited for Primero

39:36.270 --> 39:37.385
and then shot him.

39:37.973 --> 39:39.762
And gentleman that you are,

39:40.141 --> 39:41.387
you handed Ana

39:41.959 --> 39:43.430
the murder weapon.

39:44.010 --> 39:46.774
So you can put me inside the bedroom.

39:46.841 --> 39:48.112
Can't put me outside.

39:48.603 --> 39:49.525
Yes, I can.

39:50.390 --> 39:52.228
What, my belt again?

39:52.362 --> 39:54.188
No, I'm referring to your tattoo.

39:55.518 --> 39:57.289
Could you lift up your shirt, please?

40:04.307 --> 40:05.275
I don't see anything.

40:05.310 --> 40:06.238
I do.

40:06.520 --> 40:07.896
I see fire, Eddie.

40:08.305 --> 40:10.491
There was a witness to the shooting,

40:10.509 --> 40:13.755
and the witness said that she saw fire.

40:23.129 --> 40:24.981
Now, if I put you in a lineup,

40:24.983 --> 40:27.694
the witness is going to pick
you out, I can guarantee it.

40:28.479 --> 40:31.203
I will have two gangs after me.

40:31.204 --> 40:33.359
I will not make it to the lineup.

40:34.266 --> 40:35.135
Well, maybe

40:35.170 --> 40:36.511
this is a good opportunity

40:36.546 --> 40:38.285
for you to find out about loyalty.

40:39.719 --> 40:41.765
Especially where you're going.

41:14.053 --> 41:15.719
Mrs. Seaborne.

41:16.596 --> 41:18.525
I'm Officer Wolfe from the crime lab.

41:18.564 --> 41:19.919
Yes. Thank you for calling me.

41:19.920 --> 41:20.923
How's my daughter?

41:20.958 --> 41:21.926
Oh, she's fine, ma'am.

41:22.271 --> 41:23.700
There you are.

41:23.702 --> 41:26.159
We had an eventful day, didn't we?

41:26.168 --> 41:27.572
Let's get you home.

41:27.573 --> 41:29.764
And, Officer, let me know what
the next step is with that nanny.

41:29.799 --> 41:31.291
Okay, I'll do that.

41:31.344 --> 41:32.745
Thank you, Celia.

41:33.912 --> 41:35.184
Ma'am...

41:35.876 --> 41:37.074
Hey, Nicole.

41:37.149 --> 41:39.796
You should hear your
ring tone. It's fantastic.

41:40.544 --> 41:41.287
She's fine.

41:41.322 --> 41:42.306
She's all in one piece,

41:42.341 --> 41:44.930
but I am never using
that nanny service again.

41:45.931 --> 41:46.884
Uh, not today,

41:46.919 --> 41:49.166
but why don't you come
over to the house tomorrow.

42:04.110 --> 42:06.624
Horatio, it's Wolfe.

42:07.471 --> 42:09.678
I got a situation. Can
I run something by you?

42:27.593 --> 42:28.599
What's happening?

42:28.634 --> 42:30.083
You're going home. Taxi.

42:30.126 --> 42:31.217
I don't understand.

42:31.252 --> 42:32.508
You're free to go, Ms. Warren.

42:32.510 --> 42:34.216
The Seabornes aren't pressing charges?

42:34.251 --> 42:36.074
Not after I mentioned the weekly visits

42:36.109 --> 42:37.897
by child services, no, they're not.

42:38.380 --> 42:39.662
I don't know how to thank you.

42:39.666 --> 42:40.940
There's no need, ma'am.

42:40.954 --> 42:42.247
You take care.

42:46.459 --> 42:48.000
Thank you, Ryan.

42:48.077 --> 42:49.639
You wanted to help Bethany,

42:50.415 --> 42:52.277
and you did more than you know.

43:07.384 --> 43:08.132
Thanks, boss.

43:08.591 --> 43:09.835
You did the right thing, Wolfe.

43:11.717 --> 43:13.588
Still, I feel bad for that kid.

43:14.834 --> 43:16.588
Such an uncaring family.

43:16.599 --> 43:19.317
It's more common then we'd
like to admit, though, isn't it?

43:21.290 --> 43:22.338
Bright and early, H?

43:22.847 --> 43:24.545
Bright and early, Wolfe.

43:26.751 --> 43:27.627
Bright...

43:30.018 --> 43:31.221
and early.
