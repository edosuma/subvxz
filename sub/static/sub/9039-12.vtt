WEBVTT

00:03.900 --> 00:06.333
- ROBERT SET ME UP.

00:06.333 --> 00:09.067
I MEAN, YOU DON'T GIVE
YOUR GIRLFRIEND OF TWO YEARS

00:09.067 --> 00:11.067
A LITTLE VELVET BOX
FOR HER BIRTHDAY

00:11.067 --> 00:14.467
AND NOT HAVE IT BE
AN ENGAGEMENT RING.

00:14.467 --> 00:15.867
- OH, AMY.

00:15.867 --> 00:17.533
YOU KNOW, I
DON'T HAVE ANY CHOCOLATE,

00:17.533 --> 00:20.600
BUT BITE THE HEADS OFF
THESE ANIMAL CRACKERS.

00:20.600 --> 00:23.100
- THANKS.

00:23.100 --> 00:25.133
- SO WHAT WAS IN THE BOX?

00:25.133 --> 00:27.833
- OH, ONE OF THOSE
BEAUTIFUL PEARL

00:27.833 --> 00:31.500
WE'RE-NEVER-GETTING-MARRIED
NECKLACES.

00:31.500 --> 00:33.167
- YOU KNOW,
YOU JUST GOT TO GIVE IT TIME.

00:33.167 --> 00:35.233
YOU AND ROBERT
WILL GET MARRIED EVENTUALLY.

00:35.233 --> 00:37.233
- NO, WE TALKED ABOUT IT,

00:37.233 --> 00:38.700
YOU KNOW, WHEN HE ASKED ME

00:38.700 --> 00:42.600
WHY I THREW
THE VELVET BOX AT HIS HEAD.

00:42.600 --> 00:43.700
AND HE TOLD ME,

00:43.700 --> 00:45.100
"I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WANT.

00:45.100 --> 00:46.167
IT'S NOT YOU; IT'S ME."

00:46.167 --> 00:47.333
- OH, GOD.

00:47.333 --> 00:49.200
"IT'S NOT YOU; IT'S ME."

00:49.200 --> 00:51.633
THAT'S ON THE GUYS'
GREATEST HITS ALBUM.

00:52.867 --> 00:54.700
- SO I BROKE UP WITH HIM.

00:54.700 --> 00:57.467
- YOU--AGAIN?
ON YOUR BIRTHDAY?

00:57.467 --> 00:59.400
- WHY NOT?

00:59.400 --> 01:01.467
I CAME INTO THIS WORLD ALONE.

01:01.467 --> 01:03.267
- OH, AMY...

01:03.267 --> 01:04.733
OH, SWEETIE...

01:04.733 --> 01:06.567
- NO. IT'S MY FAULT.

01:06.567 --> 01:09.367
I KEEP FALLING
FOR THE WRONG GUYS.

01:09.367 --> 01:11.433
THIS IS MY PATTERN.

01:11.433 --> 01:15.500
- WELL, YOUR PATTERN USED TO BE
FALLING FOR GUYS WHO WERE GAY.

01:15.500 --> 01:17.400
- THEY DIDN'T START OUT GAY.

01:17.400 --> 01:20.700
THEY BECAME GAY
AFTER GOING OUT WITH ME.

01:20.700 --> 01:22.733
- WELL, AT LEAST IT WASN'T THAT
THIS TIME.

01:22.733 --> 01:24.733
- AS FAR AS WE KNOW.

01:24.733 --> 01:26.467
- YEAH, RIGHT.

01:28.333 --> 01:31.633
- MAYBE ROBERT IS GAY.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.467
- NO.

01:33.467 --> 01:35.300
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

01:35.300 --> 01:36.633
- THINK ABOUT IT.

01:36.633 --> 01:39.533
HE COLOR-COORDINATES
HIS CLOTHES.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.133
HE CAN DANCE.

01:42.533 --> 01:45.033
CERTAINLY VERY ATTACHED
TO HIS MOTHER.

01:46.667 --> 01:48.700
AND HE DIDN'T PRESSURE ME
TO SLEEP WITH HIM

01:48.700 --> 01:52.300
WHEN I WASN'T READY
THAT WHOLE FIRST YEAR.

01:56.333 --> 01:58.600
- YEAH, BUT THEN YOU DID
SLEEP WITH HIM.

01:58.600 --> 01:59.700
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

01:59.700 --> 02:02.800
ROBERT LIKES WOMEN.
HE WAS MARRIED ONCE.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.100
- YEAH, I KNOW.

02:04.100 --> 02:08.200
HE STARTED OUT STRAIGHT,
BUT I TURN THEM.

02:08.200 --> 02:10.567
I'M THE SPATULA.

02:17.367 --> 02:20.233
- I SHOULD NEVER HAVE
FIXED AMY AND ROBERT UP.

02:20.233 --> 02:23.067
- HEY, THEY HAD A GOOD RUN.

02:23.067 --> 02:26.900
LOOK, SOMETIMES THESE THINGS
DON'T WORK OUT, YOU KNOW.

02:26.900 --> 02:28.767
AND SOMETIMES THEY DO.

02:30.633 --> 02:33.600
- TWO AND A HALF CHILD-BEARING
YEARS OFF OF AMY'S LIFE.

02:33.600 --> 02:34.800
- MMM.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.733
- YOU KNOW WHAT I
DON'T UNDERSTAND?

02:36.733 --> 02:38.767
- [sighs]

02:38.767 --> 02:42.667
THAT WHEN I KISS YOUR NECK,
I'M NOT CHECKING FOR TICKS.

02:51.867 --> 02:55.433
- ROBERT IS--
ROBERT'S ALWAYS SAYING

02:55.433 --> 02:56.833
THAT HE WANTS WHAT YOU HAVE:

02:56.833 --> 02:58.400
A HOUSE, A WIFE, KIDS.

02:58.400 --> 03:00.200
HE'S GONNA END UP SPENDING
THE REST OF HIS LIFE

03:00.200 --> 03:01.433
GOING ON DATE AFTER DATE,

03:01.433 --> 03:03.867
LOOKING FOR LOVE
WITH STRANGERS.

03:03.867 --> 03:05.733
- YEAH.

03:09.167 --> 03:10.967
- I'M SERIOUS.

03:10.967 --> 03:12.467
I THINK ROBERT
NEEDS TO GET SOME HELP.

03:12.467 --> 03:15.000
HE'S GOT THIS BIG FEAR
OF COMMITMENT.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.433
- IS THAT WHAT AMY THINKS?

03:16.433 --> 03:18.533
- NO. AMY THINKS HE'S GAY.

03:18.533 --> 03:21.633
- HAH. YEAH.
I'LL BET SHE DOES.

03:21.633 --> 03:23.967
- WHAT?
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

03:23.967 --> 03:25.133
- NOTHING.

03:25.133 --> 03:26.667
I JUST--
I THINK IT'S FUNNY

03:26.667 --> 03:30.033
HOW A WOMAN ALWAYS SAYS
IF A GUY REJECTS HER,

03:30.033 --> 03:32.633
OH, HE MUST BE GAY.

03:32.633 --> 03:34.167
YOU ALWAYS REJECT ME,

03:34.167 --> 03:39.900
A-AND I DON'T CALL YOU
A LESBIAN...

03:39.900 --> 03:41.700
EVERY SINGLE TIME.

03:43.867 --> 03:46.900
- I MEAN, IS THERE A CHANCE?

03:46.900 --> 03:50.467
- THAT YOU'RE A LESBIAN?

03:50.467 --> 03:53.000
- THAT YOUR BROTHER
IS GAY?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.433
- NO!

03:54.433 --> 03:56.200
WHY?
JUST BECAUSE HE'S NOT MARRIED?

03:56.200 --> 03:58.267
WHY ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT THIS?

03:58.267 --> 04:02.133
OH, YOU WILL DO ANYTHING
TO AVOID SEX WITH ME.

04:02.133 --> 04:04.433
- I'M JUST SAYING,
YOU KNOW, MAYBE HE IS

04:04.433 --> 04:07.000
AND MAYBE HE DOESN'T
KNOW THAT HE IS.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.200
- HE'S DEFINITELY NOT.

04:08.200 --> 04:09.800
ALL RIGHT?
HE'S MY BROTHER.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.700
- OH, OKAY.

04:11.700 --> 04:13.200
YOU KNOW,
CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING?

04:13.200 --> 04:14.633
THERE ARE SOME MEN

04:14.633 --> 04:16.500
WHO WON'T EVEN CONSIDER
THE POSSIBILITY

04:16.500 --> 04:18.033
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE
TOO DEVASTATING

04:18.033 --> 04:21.967
TO THEIR HOMOPHOBIC FAMILIES.

04:21.967 --> 04:25.100
- OOH, LOOK AT MY BIG WORDS.

04:31.367 --> 04:32.833
- I'M JUST SAYING THAT,
YOU KNOW,

04:32.833 --> 04:35.300
EVEN IF ROBERT SUSPECTED
THAT HE MIGHT BE THAT WAY,

04:35.300 --> 04:36.867
YOU COULD SEE
HOW HE WOULD THINK

04:36.867 --> 04:39.200
THAT IT WOULD BE EASIER
JUST NOT EVEN TO DEAL WITH IT,

04:39.200 --> 04:42.000
EVEN IF IT MEANT
ENDING UP OLD AND ALONE.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.733
AND WOULDN'T THAT BE SAD?

04:44.733 --> 04:47.000
- YOU WANT TO SEE OLD AND ALONE?

04:54.333 --> 04:56.267
- WHAT ARE YOU READING?

04:56.267 --> 04:57.667
- THE OBITUARIES.

04:57.667 --> 04:59.867
[chuckling]

04:59.867 --> 05:04.400
I BEAT ALL THESE GUYS.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.267
- HEY, I NEED TO BORROW
YOUR VACUUM.

05:06.267 --> 05:07.600
- HELLO, DEAR.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.067
YOU'RE JUST IN TIME
FOR PANCAKES.

05:09.067 --> 05:10.200
- ALL RIGHT.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.567
- HEY!
THOSE ARE MY PANCAKES!

05:11.567 --> 05:13.133
WHY CAN'T HE WAIT
FOR THE NEXT BATCH?

05:13.133 --> 05:15.067
- I LOVE HIM.

05:16.233 --> 05:17.600
- OH, BOY, THESE ARE GOOD.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.700
- I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE
A HALF AN HOUR.

05:19.700 --> 05:21.467
TOMORROW YOU'RE GONNA
READ MY OBIT.

05:21.467 --> 05:26.200
"LOCAL MAN DIES
WAITING FOR FLAPJACKS."

05:26.200 --> 05:29.033
- "MARIE BARONE
DANCES IN STREET."

05:30.933 --> 05:34.067
- "DISASTER DECLARED."

05:34.067 --> 05:36.300
"PRESIDENT TO VISIT STREET."

05:40.200 --> 05:42.500
- ALL RIGHT,
WHERE'S THE VACUUM?

05:42.500 --> 05:44.067
- WHY, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOURS?

05:44.067 --> 05:47.233
- AH, IT'S HANGING
ON A CURTAIN.

05:50.133 --> 05:51.600
- YOU WERE VACUUMING?

05:51.600 --> 05:53.400
- YEAH. WHY?

05:53.400 --> 05:55.800
I HELP OUT AROUND
THE HOUSE SOMETIMES.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.567
- OH, THAT'S NICE.

05:57.567 --> 05:59.100
DO YOU DUST TOO?

05:59.100 --> 06:00.567
WITH A LITTLE
FEATHER DUSTER?

06:00.567 --> 06:02.100
NANCY?

06:03.667 --> 06:06.233
- YOU KNOW, DAD,

06:06.233 --> 06:08.933
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU TALK
LIKE THAT,

06:08.933 --> 06:10.900
PEOPLE COULD GET OFFENDED.

06:10.900 --> 06:14.133
- OFFENDED BY WHAT?

06:14.133 --> 06:15.733
- NOTHING. NOTHING.
FORGET ABOUT IT.

06:15.733 --> 06:17.067
- NO. WHAT?

06:17.067 --> 06:19.133
- NOTHING. IT'S JUST...

06:19.133 --> 06:20.433
WHEN YOU SAY "NANCY,"

06:20.433 --> 06:23.267
WHAT ARE YOU
IMPLYING EXACTLY?

06:23.267 --> 06:26.267
- THAT YOUR NAME
SHOULD BE NANCY.

06:29.767 --> 06:34.533
- AND WHEN YOU SAY "NANCY,"
THAT'S YOUR WORD FOR GAY.

06:34.533 --> 06:36.367
- VERY WELL.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.967
- AND--AND YOU MEAN THAT
AS AN INSULT?

06:44.967 --> 06:47.400
- YES, I BELIEVE I DO.

06:49.033 --> 06:52.000
- WELL, THAT--
THAT'S NOT NICE.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.567
- THAT'S WHY IT'S A GOOD INSULT.

06:54.567 --> 06:55.700
- NO.

06:55.700 --> 06:58.200
I MEAN THAT'S
NOT NICE TO GAY PEOPLE.

06:59.767 --> 07:01.233
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:01.233 --> 07:02.967
I'M SORRY...

07:02.967 --> 07:04.433
MARY.

07:06.967 --> 07:09.000
- OH, FORGET IT, RAYMOND.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.933
FORGET IT.
IT'S NO USE.

07:10.933 --> 07:12.467
I'VE SEEN HOW
YOUR FATHER ACTS

07:12.467 --> 07:14.633
IN FRONT OF PEOPLE
WHO HAPPEN TO BE HOMOSEXUAL.

07:14.633 --> 07:17.567
HE'S THE SAME ASS HE IS
IN FRONT OF US.

07:21.933 --> 07:23.733
- YOU KNOW
SOME HOMOSEXUAL PEOPLE?

07:23.733 --> 07:25.000
- OF COURSE WE DO.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.833
MY SECOND COUSIN FREDA.

07:26.833 --> 07:28.100
- WHAT?

07:28.100 --> 07:29.267
- YOU KNEW THAT.

07:29.267 --> 07:31.400
- I MOST CERTAINLY DID NOT.

07:31.400 --> 07:34.100
- WHY DO YOU THINK
SHE NEVER GOT MARRIED?

07:34.100 --> 07:36.600
- BECAUSE SHE
LOOKS LIKE A PIT BULL.

07:42.100 --> 07:44.067
- SHE EVEN BROUGHT
HER GIRLFRIEND

07:44.067 --> 07:46.267
TO OUR ANNIVERSARY PARTY.

07:46.267 --> 07:50.233
- THAT BLUE HAIR
WHO ATE ALL THE MEATBALLS?

07:50.233 --> 07:52.467
- YEAH, THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER
FOR YEARS.

07:52.467 --> 07:55.767
MIDGE.

07:55.767 --> 07:57.733
- AND--AND YOU HAVE
NO PROBLEM WITH THIS?

07:57.733 --> 07:59.833
- IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICE
IF SHE LEFT SOME MEATBALLS

07:59.833 --> 08:01.467
FOR THE OTHER GUESTS.

08:01.467 --> 08:04.533
BUT I HAVE NO PROBLEMS
WITH THE GAY PEOPLE.

08:07.933 --> 08:10.000
- WHAT DID YOU
BRING THIS UP FOR?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.467
- I DIDN'T. I DIDN'T.

08:11.467 --> 08:12.667
LAST NIGHT,
DEBRA WAS SAYIN'

08:12.667 --> 08:14.867
THAT IF SOMEONE
IN OUR FAMILY WAS GAY--

08:14.867 --> 08:17.000
- WAS IT JEFFREY?

08:17.000 --> 08:18.233
I TOLD YOU ABOUT HIM.

08:18.233 --> 08:19.433
- WOULD YOU STOP, DAD?

08:19.433 --> 08:21.567
- LOOK AT HIM.
HE RUNS FUNNY.

08:21.567 --> 08:23.267
- OH.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.133
WE WERE TALKIN'
ABOUT ROBERT.

08:27.133 --> 08:28.300
- ROBERT?

08:28.300 --> 08:29.300
- ROBERT'S NOT GAY.

08:29.300 --> 08:32.833
HE'S A POLICEMAN.

08:32.833 --> 08:38.367
- ONE OF THOSE VILLAGE PEOPLE
WAS A POLICEMAN.

08:38.367 --> 08:39.933
- ROBERT'S NOT GAY.

08:39.933 --> 08:41.233
- THEN WHY DID
YOU SAY HE WAS?

08:41.233 --> 08:42.533
- I DIDN'T!

08:42.533 --> 08:44.200
- HEY, YOU TAUGHT HIM
ALL THOSE SONGS.

08:44.200 --> 08:48.033
- WHAT?
WE SANG SONGS TOGETHER.

08:48.033 --> 08:50.500
[singing]
SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW

08:50.500 --> 08:51.867
- KNOCK IT OFF!

08:51.867 --> 08:52.933
- WHAT?

08:52.933 --> 08:54.167
- THAT'S HOW IT STARTS!

08:54.167 --> 08:55.433
- OH, PLEASE!

08:55.433 --> 08:59.000
HE'S NOT GAY.
HE'S DATING AMY.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.067
- YEAH, WELL...

09:00.067 --> 09:02.700
- WHAT? THEY BROKE UP?

09:02.700 --> 09:04.000
- YES, BUT--BUT--

09:04.000 --> 09:05.900
- THEY BROKE UP?
WHY DID THEY BREAK UP?

09:05.900 --> 09:07.200
- I DON'T KNOW, MA.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.100
- THIS IS THE THIRD TIME.

09:09.100 --> 09:10.533
[gasps]
OH, MY GOD.

09:10.533 --> 09:12.333
- OH, COME ON.
LOOK, IT'S NOT BECAUSE--

09:12.333 --> 09:14.067
- I TOLD YOU.
IT WAS TOO MUCH MOTHERING.

09:14.067 --> 09:16.200
YOU'RE ALWAYS HUGGING HIM.

09:16.200 --> 09:18.367
- DID YOU EVER HUG HIM ONCE?

09:18.367 --> 09:20.833
- WHAT THE HELL
IS HAPPENING HERE?

09:20.833 --> 09:22.167
- NOTHING!

09:22.167 --> 09:24.600
NOTHING IS HAPPENING, FRANK.

09:24.600 --> 09:27.167
COULD YOU TRY TO BE MATURE
FOR A SECOND?

09:27.167 --> 09:28.167
HE'S STILL OUR SON.

09:28.167 --> 09:29.567
WE NEED TO UNDERST--

09:29.567 --> 09:32.300
- OH, COULD YOU BOTH
STOP, PLEASE?

09:32.300 --> 09:34.633
- HELLO, EVERYBODY.

09:36.167 --> 09:37.633
- ROBERT.

09:47.233 --> 09:50.633
IT'S FINE WITH ME
IF YOU'RE GAY, DEAR.

10:00.867 --> 10:02.800
- WHO TOLD YOU I WAS GAY?

10:02.800 --> 10:03.833
- RAYMOND.

10:03.833 --> 10:05.333
- MA!

10:06.633 --> 10:08.100
I DIDN'T SAY THAT,
ALL RIGHT?

10:08.100 --> 10:09.633
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

10:09.633 --> 10:12.467
- HE TOLD US THAT YOU
BROKE UP WITH AMY AGAIN.

10:12.467 --> 10:14.833
- WELL, THAT MEANS I'M NOT
READY TO GET MARRIED RIGHT NOW.

10:14.833 --> 10:16.267
IT DOESN'T MEAN I'M GAY.

10:16.267 --> 10:18.467
- ALL RIGHT, SWEETHEART.
HAVE SOME PANCAKES.

10:18.467 --> 10:20.733
- I'M NOT GAY!
TELL THEM, RAYMOND.

10:20.733 --> 10:21.867
- HE'S NOT!

10:21.867 --> 10:23.400
- HERE.
SIT DOWN, DEAR.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.200
- YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST
THIS THING WITH AMY WAS

10:25.200 --> 10:26.667
I-I-I COULDN'T COMMIT
RIGHT NOW.

10:26.667 --> 10:27.867
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

10:27.867 --> 10:29.300
MAYBE SHE'S NOT THE ONE FOR ME.

10:29.300 --> 10:31.433
- IS IT BECAUSE SHE'S A WOMAN?

10:33.867 --> 10:36.967
- OH, MY GOD.

10:36.967 --> 10:41.067
IS THERE A GAS LEAK
IN HERE?

10:41.067 --> 10:44.833
- OH, COME ON.
COME HERE.

10:44.833 --> 10:45.967
I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU

10:45.967 --> 10:47.367
THAT YOUR FATHER AND I
LOVE YOU

10:47.367 --> 10:49.267
AND WILL SUPPORT YOU
NO MATTER WHAT.

10:49.267 --> 10:50.533
RIGHT, FRANK?

10:57.433 --> 11:00.100
I'LL SUPPORT YOU...

11:00.100 --> 11:02.100
- THANKS, MA.

11:02.100 --> 11:03.767
- EVEN IF YOU ARE GAY.

11:03.767 --> 11:04.967
- BELIEVE ME, ROBERT,

11:04.967 --> 11:06.367
I DID NOT SAY
THAT YOU WERE GAY.

11:06.367 --> 11:09.400
- COULD WE TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE, PLEASE?

11:09.400 --> 11:12.833
- I MEAN, YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD UNDERSTAND, FRANK.

11:12.833 --> 11:14.600
WHAT ABOUT THAT MAN IN KOREA?

11:14.600 --> 11:17.500
- I TOLD YOU NEVER
TO MENTION THAT.

11:28.067 --> 11:30.367
- WHAT?
WHAT HAPPENED IN KOREA?

11:31.300 --> 11:32.900
- NOTHING HAPPENED.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.700
WE WERE IN A FOXHOLE.

11:34.700 --> 11:35.967
IT WAS COLD AND SNOWING.

11:35.967 --> 11:37.967
WE HAD TO KEEP WARM.

11:37.967 --> 11:39.367
WE HUDDLED.

11:39.367 --> 11:40.700
YOU GOTTA SURVIVE, DON'T YA?

11:40.700 --> 11:42.633
IT LASTED HALF A SECOND.

11:42.633 --> 11:46.133
- YOU SEE, DEAR,
YOUR FATHER UNDERSTANDS.

11:46.133 --> 11:47.333
- OUR COATS WERE INSUFFICIENT!

11:47.333 --> 11:49.733
IT WAS HUDDLE OR DIE!

11:49.733 --> 11:52.433
- OH, SHUT UP, FRANK.

11:52.433 --> 11:54.467
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ROBERT.

11:54.467 --> 11:57.700
AND WE'RE TELLING HIM
THAT WE WILL RESPECT HIS CHOICE.

11:57.700 --> 12:00.133
- IT'S NOT MY CHOICE!

12:00.133 --> 12:01.733
- I KNOW, DEAR.

12:01.733 --> 12:06.333
FREDA SAYS IT'S SOMETHING
YOU'RE BORN WITH.

12:06.333 --> 12:08.400
- LOOK, ROBERT, JUST IGNORE 'EM.
THAT'S ALL.

12:08.400 --> 12:11.000
- IGNORE THEM?
MY PARENTS THINK I'M GAY.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.433
- SO WHAT?

12:12.433 --> 12:14.000
IF THEY TELL
EVERYONE THEY KNOW,

12:14.000 --> 12:16.133
THAT'S FOUR PEOPLE.

12:24.700 --> 12:27.000
- THANKS A LOT, RAYMOND.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.833
- I DIDN'T SAY YOU WERE,
ALL RIGHT?

12:28.833 --> 12:30.400
IT WAS A "WHAT IF?"

12:30.400 --> 12:32.400
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
"WHAT IF WE WERE ADOPTED?"

12:32.400 --> 12:35.267
IT DIDN'T REALLY HAPPEN,
BUT IT'S FUN TO THINK ABOUT.

12:37.400 --> 12:39.633
- YEAH?
WELL, HAVE YOUR FUN.

12:42.167 --> 12:46.567
- HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN
VERY SENSITIVE.

12:46.567 --> 12:47.400
- HE OUTRANKED ME.

12:47.400 --> 12:50.000
I COULDN'T SAY NO!

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
- [singing]
IT'S SO NICE TO BE

13:09.000 --> 13:13.100
BACK HOME WHERE I BELONG

13:13.100 --> 13:14.933
YOU'RE LOOKING S--
[music stops]

13:14.933 --> 13:16.867
[knock on door]

13:16.867 --> 13:18.300
- ROBERT.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.033
I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE.

13:23.033 --> 13:26.300
I PARKED RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

13:26.300 --> 13:28.700
- THEN MOVE YOUR CAR.

13:28.700 --> 13:32.367
I DON'T WANT TO BE LATE
FOR MY PARADE IN THE VILLAGE.

13:35.667 --> 13:38.600
- COME ON,
I JUST WANT TO TALK.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.433
- GO AWAY.

13:40.433 --> 13:43.500
- LISTEN,
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT GAY!

13:43.500 --> 13:45.100
- GET IN HERE!

13:51.267 --> 13:53.067
YOU DON'T THINK I'M GAY?

13:53.067 --> 13:55.233
THEN WHY WAS I OUTED
AT BREAKFAST?

13:55.233 --> 13:57.267
- COME ON, YOU KNOW
MOM AND DAD.

13:57.267 --> 13:59.900
YOU SAY ONE THING
AND THEY'RE OFF AND RUNNING.

13:59.900 --> 14:01.867
- AND WHAT WAS
THAT ONE THING?

14:01.867 --> 14:04.233
"ROBERT'S MAN CRAZY"?

14:06.767 --> 14:07.933
- I WOULDN'T SAY THAT.

14:07.933 --> 14:10.200
I-I'D SAY SOMETHING LIKE...

14:10.200 --> 14:12.033
LIKE, ROBERT HAS LOVELY
LITTLE KNICKKNACKS

14:12.033 --> 14:13.567
ON HIS MANTEL.

14:15.900 --> 14:19.633
- THEY ARE LOVELY.

14:19.633 --> 14:21.567
- YEAH, OKAY. SO WHAT?

14:21.567 --> 14:25.333
- I GOT THEM
AT AN ANTIQUE FAIR.

14:25.333 --> 14:27.300
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, WHATEVER.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.833
LOOK, I WAS KIDDING.

14:28.833 --> 14:31.000
I'M SORRY
THAT I TALKED TO MOM AND DAD.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.067
I ALWAYS AM.

14:35.233 --> 14:37.967
- WELL, NO, LISTEN,
I NEVER CONSIDERED IT.

14:37.967 --> 14:39.033
LOOK AT ME.

14:39.033 --> 14:40.033
I'M DIVORCED,

14:40.033 --> 14:41.200
BREAKUPS LEFT AND RIGHT...

14:41.200 --> 14:42.433
I DON'T KNOW, RAYMOND.

14:42.433 --> 14:43.900
IF THE WHOLE FAMILY
THINKS I AM--

14:43.900 --> 14:45.167
- WILL YOU STOP IT?

14:45.167 --> 14:47.067
THEY DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GAY.

14:47.067 --> 14:49.167
THEY'RE JUST CONFUSED.

14:50.567 --> 14:55.633
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE WORN
THAT SHIRT TODAY.

14:55.633 --> 14:57.800
- OH, HEY,
I DIDN'T BUY THIS SHIRT.

14:57.800 --> 15:00.300
MA BOUGHT IT FOR ME.

15:02.700 --> 15:04.400
- AW.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.967
LOOK, THIS WHOLE THING
IS DEBRA'S FAULT.

15:06.967 --> 15:08.267
SHE--SHE PUT
THE IDEA IN MY HEAD

15:08.267 --> 15:09.967
THAT IF YOU WERE GAY--

15:09.967 --> 15:11.500
- DEBRA THINKS I'M GAY TOO?

15:11.500 --> 15:13.233
- NO!
NO ONE THINKS YOU'RE GAY!

15:13.233 --> 15:14.900
EXCEPT FOR MAYBE AMY.

15:14.900 --> 15:16.200
- OH.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.400
ONLY THE WOMAN
I WAS SLEEPING WITH.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.533
- LOOK, AMY'S GOT NOTHING
TO COMPARE IT WITH.

15:20.533 --> 15:23.767
SHE WAS A VIRGIN
WHEN YOU MET HER.

15:23.767 --> 15:25.100
COME ON.

15:25.100 --> 15:26.900
YOU GOT NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

15:26.900 --> 15:28.333
JEEZ.

15:31.633 --> 15:34.300
- HEY, RAY.

15:34.300 --> 15:37.300
LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING.

15:37.300 --> 15:39.167
DO YOU EVER NOTICE GUYS?

15:39.167 --> 15:40.700
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

15:40.700 --> 15:42.900
- WELL, LIKE IF A GUY'S
REALLY CUT, YOU KNOW,

15:42.900 --> 15:45.167
WHEN YOU'RE AT THE GYM.

15:45.167 --> 15:46.567
YOU EVER NOTICE 'EM?

15:52.900 --> 15:55.067
- NOPE.

15:55.067 --> 15:56.100
- OH.

15:56.100 --> 15:58.433
- HMM.

15:58.433 --> 16:00.667
DO YOU?

16:00.667 --> 16:02.633
- A LITTLE BIT.

16:02.633 --> 16:03.567
- YEAH, WELL, SO WHAT?

16:03.567 --> 16:04.867
SO YOU NOTICE THEM
A LITTLE.

16:04.867 --> 16:05.867
SO WHAT?
THAT'S NORMAL.

16:05.867 --> 16:07.800
- THEN WHY DON'T YOU?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.033
- ALL RIGHT.

16:09.033 --> 16:10.267
I NOTICE A LITTLE.

16:10.267 --> 16:11.767
LIKE I NOTICED
YOUR KNICKKNACKS.

16:11.767 --> 16:13.267
IT'S...

16:13.267 --> 16:15.200
IT'S SOMETHING IN THE ROOM,
THAT'S ALL.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.467
IT DOESN'T MEAN I GOT A THING
FOR KNICKKNACKS.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.567
- SO YOU NEVER WONDERED
IF YOU WERE?

16:28.567 --> 16:32.067
- EVERY GUY WONDERS IF HE IS
AT SOME POINT.

16:32.067 --> 16:33.233
- YOU SURE?

16:33.233 --> 16:34.633
- YEAH, YEAH.

16:34.633 --> 16:36.433
YOU WONDER,
AND THEN YOU SEE SOME BREASTS,

16:36.433 --> 16:38.467
YOU WALK INTO A WALL,
AND THERE YOU GO.

16:41.433 --> 16:42.433
- SO...

16:42.433 --> 16:43.767
WHEN DID YOU
THINK ABOUT IT?

16:43.767 --> 16:45.133
- I DON'T KNOW.

16:45.133 --> 16:46.767
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T REMEMBER.

16:46.767 --> 16:49.233
- YOU DON'T REMEMBER 'CAUSE YOU
NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

16:49.233 --> 16:50.300
- I THOUGHT ABOUT IT!

16:50.300 --> 16:52.033
- WHEN?
- TENTH GRADE!

16:52.967 --> 16:55.333
- GO AHEAD.

16:55.333 --> 16:56.867
- IT WAS NOTHING.

16:56.867 --> 16:58.467
IT'S...

16:58.467 --> 17:00.867
PATRICK LOPEZ WROTE
"YOU'RE A GAY" IN MY YEARBOOK.

17:00.867 --> 17:02.700
AND I THOUGHT...

17:02.700 --> 17:05.467
MAYBE I WAS.

17:05.467 --> 17:07.067
- JUST BECAUSE
HE WROTE THAT?

17:07.067 --> 17:08.367
- NO.

17:08.367 --> 17:09.967
BECAUSE...
PATRICK LOPEZ WAS GAY,

17:09.967 --> 17:12.300
AND I THOUGHT HE WOULD KNOW.

17:14.967 --> 17:16.767
- WHAT IF I DON'T KNOW?

17:16.767 --> 17:18.367
- WELL, YOU--YOU'RE NOT!

17:18.367 --> 17:20.300
WH...EVEN IF YOU WERE,
WELL, ALL RIGHT.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.633
IT WOULDN'T BE
THE END OF THE WORLD.

17:21.633 --> 17:23.167
YOU'D STILL BE
MY BROTHER.

17:24.367 --> 17:27.667
MY BIG
HOMOSEXUAL BROTHER.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.767
- THAT MEANS
A LOT TO ME, RAYMOND.

17:33.767 --> 17:35.700
- YEAH. YEAH, YEAH.

17:45.300 --> 17:46.567
[Robert chuckles]

17:46.567 --> 17:47.867
- I'M GLAD
WE HAD THIS TALK.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.533
THIS IS NICE.

17:49.533 --> 17:52.267
I SHOULD BE GAY
MORE OFTEN.

17:53.333 --> 17:54.767
HEY, DID YOU HEAR
WHAT MA SAID?

17:54.767 --> 17:55.767
- WHEN?

17:55.767 --> 17:57.100
- THIS MORNING.

17:57.100 --> 17:58.867
SHE SAID THAT SHE WOULD
LOVE AND SUPPORT ME

17:58.867 --> 18:00.200
NO MATTER WHAT.

18:00.200 --> 18:03.833
THAT'S THE NICEST THING
SHE EVER SAID TO ME.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.167
THE RUNNER-UP WAS

18:05.167 --> 18:07.433
"YOU'VE GOT SPINACH
IN YOUR TEETH."

18:07.433 --> 18:09.600
I'LL TELL YOU
ONE THING:

18:09.600 --> 18:13.600
I WOULD'VE MADE
AN EXCELLENT GAY MAN.

18:13.600 --> 18:14.667
- WHAT?

18:14.667 --> 18:15.833
- YEAH. HEAR ME OUT.

18:15.833 --> 18:17.867
I ALWAYS HAVE PROBLEMS
WITH WOMEN, RIGHT?

18:17.867 --> 18:19.667
BUT YOU HANG WITH A GUY...

18:19.667 --> 18:21.133
THERE'S NO HASSLES.

18:21.133 --> 18:22.633
PLAY SOME GOLF.

18:22.633 --> 18:24.733
Y-YOU TELL A JOKE.
NOBODY'S OFFENDED.

18:24.733 --> 18:26.700
OR YOU WOULDN'T
EVEN HAVE TO TALK AT ALL.

18:26.700 --> 18:28.133
NOBODY CARES.

18:28.133 --> 18:29.467
WE COULD SIT AND WATCH TV

18:29.467 --> 18:31.267
AS LONG AS WE WANT,
AND NOBODY ASKS,

18:31.267 --> 18:33.700
[in a high-pitched voice]
"WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?"

18:33.700 --> 18:36.733
- MAYBE I'M GAY.

18:36.733 --> 18:40.233
[chuckles]

18:40.233 --> 18:41.600
- DON'T LAUGH SO FAST.

18:41.600 --> 18:43.100
THERE WAS A SERGEANT
ON OUR FORCE,

18:43.100 --> 18:44.867
A REGULAR GUY
JUST LIKE YOU AND ME,

18:44.867 --> 18:46.367
WHO HAD NO IDEA HE WAS THAT WAY

18:46.367 --> 18:49.233
UNTIL HIS TRIP TO HAWAII.

18:49.233 --> 18:51.133
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHY? WHAT HAPPENED?

18:51.133 --> 18:52.733
- A GUY RENTED HIM
A BOOGIE BOARD,

18:52.733 --> 18:55.100
AND A BELL WENT OFF.

18:55.100 --> 18:58.500
TODAY THEY RUN
A GIFT SHOP ON MAUI.

19:01.800 --> 19:02.800
- SO WHAT?

19:02.800 --> 19:04.067
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

19:04.067 --> 19:06.933
WE JUST HAVEN'T MET MR. RIGHT?

19:06.933 --> 19:08.500
- I DON'T KNOW.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.600
- DEBRA AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT
GOING TO HAWAII.

19:13.967 --> 19:15.967
- I WOULDN'T.

19:15.967 --> 19:18.200
[knock on door]

19:18.200 --> 19:19.933
- ROBERT.

19:19.933 --> 19:21.200
HEY...

19:21.200 --> 19:23.333
YOU GOT SOMEONE IN THERE?

19:29.600 --> 19:32.000
- YES I DO.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.333
- NEVERMIND, I'LL COME BACK.

19:35.333 --> 19:36.633
OH.

19:36.633 --> 19:38.067
HEY, RAY.

19:38.067 --> 19:39.900
- YEAH, HI THERE, DAD.

19:39.900 --> 19:41.233
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

19:41.233 --> 19:44.267
- I GOT TO GET
YOUR MOTHER OFF MY BACK.

19:44.267 --> 19:45.767
SHE'S KILLING ME OVER THIS.

19:45.767 --> 19:50.733
"HE'S YOUR SON.
WHY CAN'T YOU BE A PERSON?"

19:50.733 --> 19:52.667
SO I'M HERE.

19:52.667 --> 19:54.867
I'M TALKING TO YOU.

19:54.867 --> 19:57.433
OKAY?

19:57.433 --> 19:59.000
- OKAY.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
- BUT THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.667
- OKAY.

20:04.667 --> 20:09.000
SO YOU WANT TO
WATCH A GAME OR SOMETHING?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.633
- YES.

20:10.633 --> 20:11.900
YES, THE GAME.

20:11.900 --> 20:14.000
THE GAME IS GOOD.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.067
- HOW ABOUT YOU RAY?

20:15.067 --> 20:16.267
YOU WANT TO WATCH?

20:16.267 --> 20:18.200
- YEAH, YEAH PUT THE GAME ON.

20:20.267 --> 20:24.700
- SO, THIS IS ALL RIGHT.

20:24.700 --> 20:27.367
JUST THE GUYS HANGING OUT.

20:27.367 --> 20:30.067
- DAD, LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

20:30.067 --> 20:33.300
YOU EVER BEEN TO HAWAII?

20:33.300 --> 20:36.233
- OH YEAH, I LOVE HAWAII.

20:36.233 --> 20:38.433
IT'S BEAUTIFUL THERE.

20:38.433 --> 20:40.500
ME AND A FEW OF THE GUYS
FROM MY UNIT

20:40.500 --> 20:45.867
HAD A STOPOVER THERE
ON THE WAY BACK FROM KOREA.

20:45.867 --> 20:48.400
BOY, DID WE SEE SOME ACTION!

20:55.767 --> 20:58.533
[doorbell rings]
