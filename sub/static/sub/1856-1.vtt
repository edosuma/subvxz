02:16.040 --> 02:18.427
It's a question of ambition really.

02:19.360 --> 02:21.144
Let me rephrase that.

02:21.240 --> 02:23.581
It's a matter of limitation.

02:24.080 --> 02:26.751
And the importance
of knowing yours.

02:27.680 --> 02:31.501
Your boss, Tama.
He had a reputation, yes.

02:31.560 --> 02:35.790
But he also knew where he stood,
understood how high he should climb.

02:35.880 --> 02:38.301
That's why Bangun let
him be the man he was.

02:46.240 --> 02:48.024
Don't mind them.

02:51.280 --> 02:53.462
I'm a reasonable man.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.748
Like you, I have ambitions.

02:57.040 --> 02:58.949
But you see, in this world of ours,

02:59.000 --> 03:01.990
it's really more of a "one
step at a time" kind of thing.

03:02.880 --> 03:06.348
And you should have been
some fucking steps away

03:06.400 --> 03:09.344
from a meeting like this.

03:11.760 --> 03:13.828
- Bangun will...
- Bangun is an old man!

03:19.400 --> 03:21.229
He's on his way out.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.784
I gave you a chance.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.749
You chose him.

03:34.880 --> 03:36.345
So...

03:37.040 --> 03:39.791
I guess this brings us back
full circle, ambition...

03:40.840 --> 03:42.226
and limitation.

03:43.040 --> 03:45.620
Bejo. Bejo!

03:45.680 --> 03:47.987
- Please don't do this.
- I already told you.

03:48.320 --> 03:50.787
- Don't worry.
- No, no!

03:50.840 --> 03:52.385
Don't, Bejo, wait!

04:31.560 --> 04:33.503
You called?

04:33.560 --> 04:35.105
Rama.

04:36.560 --> 04:38.105
I know who you are.

04:38.960 --> 04:40.425
My brother says

04:40.480 --> 04:41.991
you're someone I can trust.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.507
He's right.

04:48.240 --> 04:50.308
They got you pretty bad.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.304
Yes, sir, they did.

04:57.720 --> 04:59.982
Take him through, get him treated.

05:07.320 --> 05:09.149
Be careful.

05:35.160 --> 05:38.150
No, wait! Stop!

05:38.200 --> 05:40.382
What the fuck?! No!

05:46.000 --> 05:50.025
- What the fuck was that?!
- It's okay. Just calm down.

05:50.120 --> 05:52.621
Take a seat. Sit.

06:07.280 --> 06:10.224
Take his jacket, gloves and
any official threads he has.

06:10.280 --> 06:12.781
Dump him far away from here.

06:12.960 --> 06:15.631
He'll float to shore by dawn.

06:15.760 --> 06:17.464
Yes, sir.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.344
Trust me.

06:21.440 --> 06:23.542
He would've never
survived until morning.

06:25.080 --> 06:29.344
This is the only way we can be sure
he won't say a word about you.

06:29.640 --> 06:30.741
About us.

06:32.280 --> 06:33.427
Us?

06:33.480 --> 06:37.585
I run a unit that weeds out
crooked cops like him.

06:38.280 --> 06:43.102
And I could do with someone like
you to help me dig out some more.

06:43.160 --> 06:45.342
We're a small division.

06:45.680 --> 06:49.068
But we're small for
a reason. Trust.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.386
I have evidence.

06:51.440 --> 06:54.271
We could've made a case.
I could've testified.

06:54.400 --> 06:58.266
No, you have hearsay,
and a box of tapes.

06:59.600 --> 07:03.227
I've been down that road
before. All it does is cough up

07:03.280 --> 07:06.623
a few more names to take the heat.
All foot soldiers just like him.

07:06.920 --> 07:09.864
No, if we're going to
clean up this city,

07:09.920 --> 07:14.150
we have to aim higher. All of them.

07:15.920 --> 07:19.661
Whether or not you like what happened
here today, they will come for you.

07:19.720 --> 07:21.948
They'll do anything to remove
you from the equation.

07:22.040 --> 07:24.029
If we don't act fast,

07:24.080 --> 07:26.182
you'll be gone.

07:26.240 --> 07:28.308
Your family too.

07:33.560 --> 07:35.549
But it doesn't have to be that way.

07:35.760 --> 07:38.750
Let's say we keep this internal.
If you keep your mouth shut

07:38.800 --> 07:42.143
until everything is taken
care of, I can protect you.

07:43.040 --> 07:44.505
For you,

07:44.560 --> 07:48.221
today never happened.
You were never here.

07:48.320 --> 07:50.991
In their eyes you're still
a rookie for fuck's sake.

07:51.040 --> 07:55.065
They won't even blink an eye at
one name missing from the report.

08:04.640 --> 08:06.708
Is this all of them?

08:06.760 --> 08:09.101
All 18.

08:09.720 --> 08:11.743
No survivors.

08:23.560 --> 08:25.185
What do you think?

08:27.800 --> 08:28.901
Reza.

08:34.240 --> 08:35.990
I'll keep looking.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.947
I'll take care of it personally.

08:39.640 --> 08:41.424
You have to.

08:54.720 --> 08:56.868
What do you want?

08:58.280 --> 09:01.145
I want you on my team.

09:01.200 --> 09:05.624
You'll be re-trained until
you have better skills.

09:05.680 --> 09:08.260
For the good

09:08.360 --> 09:10.986
of this city. What do you say?

09:14.840 --> 09:17.511
No. Not interested.

09:18.240 --> 09:21.344
- Come again?
- Sir,

09:21.400 --> 09:22.911
with all due respect,

09:22.960 --> 09:26.348
I brought him into do time. So
he could be brought to justice.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.470
And we put a bullet in him
to protect your life!

09:29.520 --> 09:32.749
There's no such thing as a clean
war in this world. Open your eyes!

09:32.840 --> 09:35.307
My eyes are wide open, sir!

09:35.360 --> 09:38.031
We may be after the same thing,

09:39.440 --> 09:42.589
but I'm not going to follow the
same path as you to get there.

10:33.080 --> 10:35.786
Who killed him?

10:35.840 --> 10:37.544
My brother.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.384
His name is Bejo.

10:39.440 --> 10:41.349
He's been on the up
for some time now.

10:41.960 --> 10:44.586
I know the name.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.504
Rama,

10:47.640 --> 10:50.061
your brother had big enemies.

10:50.120 --> 10:54.748
But they're nothing compared
to what's coming for you.

10:54.840 --> 10:56.863
I can provide safety for
your wife and child.

10:56.920 --> 11:00.627
We can keep them out of
reach. But I need you.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.390
Right now,

11:02.440 --> 11:04.269
this city is carved up

11:04.320 --> 11:06.741
between our local kingpin, Bangun,

11:06.800 --> 11:09.380
and the Goto family from Japan.

11:10.640 --> 11:13.505
Tama's job is to bribe everyone.

11:13.560 --> 11:16.982
And the police are being bribed
at his office so no one knows.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.905
If we get you close
enough to Bangun,

11:19.960 --> 11:23.348
then sure as fuck we can weed out
the rest of those crooked bastards.

11:23.400 --> 11:24.945
Rama,

11:26.440 --> 11:28.190
for this to end,

11:28.240 --> 11:30.104
I need those names.

11:30.160 --> 11:32.467
I need evidence that Reza

11:32.520 --> 11:35.021
is connected to Bangun.

11:37.440 --> 11:38.701
So, what's the next step?

11:39.640 --> 11:41.822
Uco, Bangun's only child.

11:41.880 --> 11:44.028
He's serving time in prison.

11:44.840 --> 11:47.591
It's the perfect opportunity.
Get in, get close.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.945
Meaning?

11:52.640 --> 11:54.310
I have to arrest you.

11:57.160 --> 11:59.627
It will only be a few months.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.580
You can't know where I am.

12:06.480 --> 12:09.982
And I can't be seen
anywhere near you or Angga.

12:12.720 --> 12:14.629
But if I don't do this,

12:14.680 --> 12:17.306
I can't protect us this time.

12:18.160 --> 12:20.228
Please understand.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.902
This is the only
choice I have left.

12:25.320 --> 12:27.388
He's out of the
hospital now, right?

12:27.440 --> 12:29.588
I heard he was discharged.

12:29.680 --> 12:31.703
Shut your fucking mouth!

12:32.280 --> 12:34.223
You nod here.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.221
Yes or no. Do you understand me?

12:55.840 --> 12:56.987
So, what did he do?

12:58.640 --> 12:59.741
What did he do?

13:01.280 --> 13:03.223
Enough.

13:05.040 --> 13:06.790
I need more than that.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.627
He's the asshole son of
an asshole politician.

13:10.320 --> 13:12.548
Can't you just put
me in, lock me up?

13:12.840 --> 13:14.119
Why does this kid have to bleed?

13:14.120 --> 13:17.861
His daddy is the reason
Uco is in prison.

13:17.920 --> 13:20.341
If we're talking
earning credibility,

13:20.440 --> 13:22.781
doing this puts you
immediately on his radar.

13:22.840 --> 13:26.740
At the very least, it gives you
two something to talk about.

13:27.480 --> 13:29.503
If you really want
me to beat him up,

13:29.560 --> 13:32.869
I mean really beat him up,
I need a better reason.

13:35.800 --> 13:40.588
He's also a major benefactor...

13:41.040 --> 13:42.949
for Bejo.

13:48.480 --> 13:49.741
Rama, listen,

13:50.920 --> 13:53.341
do enough to get inside,

13:53.400 --> 13:57.425
but not enough to keep
you there for good.

14:02.120 --> 14:03.221
Where is he?

19:01.560 --> 19:04.186
I believe Benny and his boys
introduced themselves yesterday?

19:04.960 --> 19:06.266
Which one is Benny?

19:07.560 --> 19:08.741
Him.

19:13.040 --> 19:15.950
Now while I'm in here, Benny and
his associates are with me.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.262
Oh, yeah? And who are you?

19:21.560 --> 19:23.469
You'll figure that
out at some point.

19:23.520 --> 19:26.464
And when you do, maybe you'll show
me a little more fucking respect.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.587
But for now, I'll be tolerant.

19:34.920 --> 19:36.749
So, what does that mean?

19:37.400 --> 19:38.740
Want me to apologize?

19:39.360 --> 19:40.746
This.

19:41.920 --> 19:43.749
This is my "just in case."

19:44.520 --> 19:48.147
There's never enough walls
to cover your back.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.790
Even you.

19:49.840 --> 19:52.341
Especially after your
little "display."

19:54.480 --> 19:56.981
I'm someone who can put walls up.

19:57.040 --> 19:59.302
I can cover your back in any
square inch of this place.

19:59.360 --> 20:01.622
You may not know who I am now.

20:01.720 --> 20:04.471
But when you do, you'll
realize how real my offer is.

20:04.520 --> 20:06.270
Join with us

20:06.320 --> 20:08.707
and own this wing with me.

20:09.520 --> 20:11.861
We could use someone like
you fighting on our side.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.831
I'm flattered but...

20:15.880 --> 20:18.347
Just so you know,
I hate rejections.

20:20.160 --> 20:21.989
With all due respect,

20:22.040 --> 20:25.110
I don't really like spending my
time acting tough in toilets.

20:25.320 --> 20:26.785
Excuse me.

20:26.840 --> 20:28.669
Listen.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.981
In here you'd be
wise to pick a side.

20:32.520 --> 20:34.941
Loners don't tend to last long.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.390
Clearly.

21:13.560 --> 21:16.186
The warden tells me you've
got quite a group here.

21:17.120 --> 21:19.063
I got who I could.

21:19.120 --> 21:22.269
I'm working to get some of our
guys inside to cover your back.

21:22.320 --> 21:24.821
But until I do, you got
to keep a low profile.

21:24.880 --> 21:28.063
- You can't trust any of these fuckers.
- Low profile?

21:28.680 --> 21:30.159
I'm my father's son.

21:30.160 --> 21:33.184
That alone makes me a target here.

21:33.240 --> 21:36.981
All I can do is use
that to protect myself.

21:37.120 --> 21:39.985
Your job is to protect me here.

21:40.040 --> 21:43.269
It would make my job a lot easier
if you'd cool things down here.

21:43.360 --> 21:45.383
When was the last time
you did time, Eka?

21:46.600 --> 21:48.862
Keeping quiet is not an option.

21:48.920 --> 21:52.706
Unless I want to wake up every
morning with a broom up my ass.

21:58.240 --> 22:01.310
Rather than lecturing me,
find out about that guy.

22:02.120 --> 22:03.824
Why's he here?

22:04.160 --> 22:05.910
Him?

22:07.280 --> 22:10.543
He wheel-chaired your favorite
politician's kid in Fuazan's club.

22:11.160 --> 22:12.546
Not bad.

22:12.640 --> 22:14.788
His name's Yuda.
He's from the sticks.

22:14.840 --> 22:16.749
- He's a nobody.
- Well, that "nobody"

22:16.800 --> 22:19.062
- took out 15 of my guys.
- So he can fight,

22:19.160 --> 22:20.261
so what?

22:20.320 --> 22:24.186
He's clean, no connections
on the outside.

22:43.400 --> 22:44.661
Who the fuck are you?

22:46.320 --> 22:48.343
I'm the guy gifting you
five years of my graft

22:48.400 --> 22:50.343
just so you can say you belong.

22:50.400 --> 22:52.707
Since you walked in
through that door,

22:52.760 --> 22:56.148
they've been eyeballing you. All
trying to get a feel for who you are.

22:57.200 --> 22:59.621
But by me sitting here,

23:00.240 --> 23:02.263
I just made you a somebody.

23:04.560 --> 23:07.391
You can thank me later.

23:07.440 --> 23:11.989
Oh, yeah, who do I thank for
the fucking three years I got?

23:12.680 --> 23:16.227
Huh? Bunawar said I'd
be out in months,

23:16.280 --> 23:17.620
not years.

23:17.680 --> 23:21.262
Did you really think that crook politician
would stop at you being in here?

23:21.360 --> 23:23.349
That it would make
things "even." Fair?

23:23.400 --> 23:25.264
No.

23:25.320 --> 23:29.141
No. You went after his son.
Be glad he didn't come after yours.

23:32.440 --> 23:35.544
- I need you to talk to Bunawar...
- Ah, heh.

23:35.640 --> 23:38.949
No, I'm just here to show my
face. And I did that already.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.182
Now you're on your own.

23:43.200 --> 23:46.031
Suck it up, don't fuck it up.

23:46.080 --> 23:50.424
I rely on you now the same
way you relied on me.

23:55.120 --> 23:57.427
Those bruises will heal.

32:18.600 --> 32:20.270
How does it feel?

32:20.320 --> 32:21.785
Different.

32:22.880 --> 32:24.789
- Here, give me that.
- No need.

32:24.880 --> 32:28.701
Just give it to me. If I'd parked further
away then, yeah, carry it yourself.

32:28.800 --> 32:31.141
But this, this I got.

32:31.400 --> 32:34.344
- It's good to have you out.
- I appreciate what you did for me.

32:34.400 --> 32:36.423
You helped me a lot
while I was in there.

32:36.480 --> 32:39.106
Pass on my thanks to your father.

32:39.160 --> 32:41.149
You can do that yourself.

32:41.480 --> 32:43.070
We're going to his office.

32:43.120 --> 32:44.870
He wants to greet you personally.

32:44.920 --> 32:47.261
- He doesn't have to.
- Yeah, he does.

32:51.840 --> 32:53.510
Okay?

33:14.840 --> 33:17.466
Do you know of a man
goes by the name Bejo?

33:18.880 --> 33:20.425
Sounds familiar.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.422
Half-Arab kid, made a name for himself
when he took out Yudi's group.

33:25.120 --> 33:27.541
He's been making waves of late.

33:28.960 --> 33:31.427
Owns a few restaurants,

33:31.480 --> 33:34.390
takes care of problems
for high-profile clients.

33:34.960 --> 33:37.950
The kind that can't afford
to carry a spotlight.

33:40.080 --> 33:42.262
I know him, came to me way back

33:42.320 --> 33:45.344
wanting collateral to set up shop.

33:46.920 --> 33:50.103
I'm getting rumors that he's
looking to expand his operations.

33:51.080 --> 33:52.625
Where?

33:52.680 --> 33:54.509
That's where the rumors stop.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.501
But it will be one of ours.

34:04.560 --> 34:06.150
Yes, that's right.

34:06.200 --> 34:09.621
I'm sorry, sir. He cannot
be disturbed momentarily.

34:09.679 --> 34:11.270
Thank you.

34:11.360 --> 34:14.429
- How long will my father be?
- He'll be done soon.

34:17.920 --> 34:20.068
Excuse the mess.

34:24.679 --> 34:26.668
It could be nothing.

34:26.719 --> 34:29.187
I just thought you'd
want to know now.

34:29.239 --> 34:32.344
While one of us can still take
care of a situation like him.

34:34.520 --> 34:36.224
I'll have my men

34:36.280 --> 34:37.541
monitor the situation.

34:37.600 --> 34:40.101
If he steps out of line,
we'll take care of it.

34:40.280 --> 34:44.271
- You have nothing to worry about.
- Who says I'm worried, asshole?

34:44.440 --> 34:46.304
Heh. Thanks.

34:46.360 --> 34:49.065
It's, "Thank you."

34:52.960 --> 34:54.949
Ah... Mr. Goto.

34:55.679 --> 34:57.908
Ah, there they are.

34:58.320 --> 35:00.149
Mr. Goto.

35:05.480 --> 35:08.106
Ah... We finally meet.

35:08.160 --> 35:09.705
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Likewise, sir.

35:10.360 --> 35:12.462
Your son speaks very highly of you.

35:12.520 --> 35:15.385
Ah... And so he should.

35:15.440 --> 35:18.862
I want you to know we tried
to get you out much sooner.

35:18.920 --> 35:20.545
But you hurt the wrong person.

35:20.600 --> 35:23.909
Let's just say his father made it
damn difficult to get you a pardon.

35:23.960 --> 35:25.061
It's okay.

35:25.120 --> 35:26.949
Besides, what's done is done.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.070
You're out now. We move on.

35:30.120 --> 35:32.188
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

35:32.240 --> 35:34.183
Now take your fucking clothes off.

35:36.800 --> 35:37.901
I'm sorry?

35:39.240 --> 35:41.069
You heard me.

35:41.920 --> 35:44.341
It's okay, Yuda, just
do what he says.

35:44.400 --> 35:48.300
- Uco, come on, wait a...
- Shh. Listen.

35:49.400 --> 35:51.707
It's not that I don't trust you.

35:51.760 --> 35:54.147
I just don't trust anybody.

35:54.560 --> 35:57.027
If the worse that happens
during your time with us

35:57.080 --> 36:00.184
is that you suffer the indignity
of an old man seeing your cock,

36:00.240 --> 36:03.867
then I'd say you got
off light. Take them off.

36:34.080 --> 36:36.262
Everything.

36:51.200 --> 36:52.904
Arms up.

36:58.240 --> 36:59.341
Turn around.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.071
Check them.

37:48.920 --> 37:50.749
All clear.

37:53.640 --> 37:55.310
Turn around.

37:59.200 --> 38:02.429
Burn them anyway.
Give him something new.

38:02.480 --> 38:04.264
Incinerator.

38:14.160 --> 38:16.308
Now, it's like this:

38:17.200 --> 38:20.224
I will always appreciate
what you did for my boy.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.831
I'll never forget that.

38:24.200 --> 38:27.304
But it's not a free pass with me.

38:29.200 --> 38:31.667
I've thanked you in person.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.263
And we'll make sure you're
looked after while you're here.

38:36.240 --> 38:38.149
But when it comes to the work,

38:38.200 --> 38:40.780
you're no more special
than anyone else.

38:41.560 --> 38:44.664
If you fuck up, you're out.

38:45.040 --> 38:47.461
I won't let you down.

38:52.920 --> 38:55.022
So this is your place.

38:55.440 --> 38:57.747
You have pretty much
everything you need.

38:58.520 --> 39:00.384
Anything else,

39:01.600 --> 39:03.509
just call and they'll
take care of it.

39:03.600 --> 39:04.861
Thanks.

39:04.920 --> 39:07.022
Bangun gave me everything I have.

39:07.080 --> 39:10.184
Just like what he's doing
for you right now.

39:11.840 --> 39:15.023
We come from the same
place, you and I.

39:15.960 --> 39:18.586
I hope that's not where
our similarities end.

39:19.760 --> 39:22.181
I'll pick you up tomorrow at 8:00.

39:24.240 --> 39:26.707
Be ready at 7:00.

40:56.160 --> 40:57.261
It's me.

40:57.320 --> 40:59.468
What happened? We lost you.

40:59.560 --> 41:02.266
You're gonna get me fucking killed.
Day one with a wire?

41:02.320 --> 41:05.629
- Are you kidding me?
- You're fresh out of prison, they wouldn't...

41:05.680 --> 41:08.909
Yeah, well, he fucking checked me
anyway. They burnt all my clothes.

41:08.960 --> 41:10.107
Do they know?

41:10.160 --> 41:12.911
If I hadn't torn that shit out
first, I'd have been burnt with it.

41:12.960 --> 41:15.347
Don't play games with
me, no more surprises.

41:15.400 --> 41:18.071
If you do that again, I'm out.

41:18.160 --> 41:19.591
Where are you?

41:19.640 --> 41:23.301
No, I'm not disclosing that, and don't
you dare trace this fucking call.

41:23.360 --> 41:26.145
I don't want you or your team
within a mile of this place.

41:26.200 --> 41:29.429
Calm down, the important
thing is you're safe.

41:29.480 --> 41:32.060
I'm fucking serious, you
could have gotten me killed.

41:32.120 --> 41:35.781
This guy, any hint at all,
and he will sniff it out.

41:36.360 --> 41:38.064
From now on, you follow my lead.

41:38.120 --> 41:40.382
I'll leave a pair of
shoes at our RV point.

41:40.440 --> 41:43.783
Fix them up and I'll pick
them up when I'm ready.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.751
You'll know I got them
once they start walking.

41:47.240 --> 41:50.947
- Hold on, I need time to...
- Just get it done.

42:34.680 --> 42:38.626
Angga, stop doing that.
I've told you before!

42:40.040 --> 42:41.380
Hello?

42:41.520 --> 42:43.349
Hello?

42:43.600 --> 42:45.065
Isa.

42:45.680 --> 42:48.147
Rama? Where are you?

42:48.200 --> 42:49.711
Are you okay?

42:50.920 --> 42:52.465
I'm safe.

42:52.560 --> 42:54.503
Don't worry about me.

42:55.120 --> 42:56.790
Isa,

42:57.800 --> 43:00.631
everything just went...

43:00.720 --> 43:02.822
I'm so sorry.

43:07.080 --> 43:08.830
Are you both safe?

43:08.880 --> 43:11.301
We're getting by.

43:17.080 --> 43:18.784
Is that Angga?

43:18.840 --> 43:20.908
Yes.

43:23.160 --> 43:25.501
Please let me listen to him.

43:25.560 --> 43:28.550
Don't put him on,
I just want to hear him.

43:28.600 --> 43:29.940
Please.

43:30.040 --> 43:31.551
Okay.

44:03.080 --> 44:04.386
Thank you.

44:04.440 --> 44:06.508
Yeah.

44:23.720 --> 44:25.868
Ears to the ground.
Eyes everywhere.

44:25.920 --> 44:29.069
With people like these, you can't
predict how they will react.

44:29.600 --> 44:32.021
We could go in smiling
or storm in shooting.

44:32.080 --> 44:33.989
And the reaction would
be exactly the same.

44:34.040 --> 44:38.190
These people are reckless, they
don't have their shit together.

44:38.240 --> 44:41.071
If they did, we wouldn't be side-stepping
puddles of piss to get to them.

44:41.120 --> 44:43.188
Focus. Don't let your mind drift.

44:43.280 --> 44:45.542
Not for a second.

44:45.600 --> 44:47.589
Topan.

44:49.240 --> 44:50.785
Uco.

45:24.040 --> 45:27.826
Sorry. Can I help you
with anything else?

45:28.600 --> 45:31.704
It's all there in the envelope.

45:31.760 --> 45:33.385
This isn't enough.

45:34.760 --> 45:36.544
Not enough?

45:37.600 --> 45:40.829
But I counted it myself.
It's exact.

45:42.600 --> 45:45.829
Oh, yeah. Go back a
month and you're right.

45:45.880 --> 45:47.903
Just like always.

45:47.960 --> 45:51.507
But this month, you're short $5000.

45:56.480 --> 45:58.025
Take a seat.

45:58.080 --> 46:00.626
Motherfucker, stop shaking around.

46:00.680 --> 46:02.111
It hurts. It's too big.

46:02.160 --> 46:05.104
Fuck this shit. Where the
fuck did you find this guy?

46:05.160 --> 46:06.341
Hitchhiker.

46:06.400 --> 46:10.027
You always bring me hitchhikers.
They have no experience.

46:10.360 --> 46:12.508
Seriously, find some other people.

46:12.560 --> 46:15.311
Let's shoot this thing,
you fucking loser!

46:15.360 --> 46:19.226
Get on with it! Camera, rolling, shooting.
Just fuck that guy's asshole, you bitch!

46:19.280 --> 46:21.462
I'll go there later.

46:21.520 --> 46:23.224
Sorry.

46:23.280 --> 46:26.589
I don't understand.
You're kidding, right?

46:28.200 --> 46:29.347
Sit down.

46:40.480 --> 46:42.025
So...

46:43.520 --> 46:46.385
For 20 years, my father has ensured

46:46.440 --> 46:49.350
that not one cop has ever
knocked on your door.

46:49.400 --> 46:51.707
Now you've been free
to operate on our turf

46:51.760 --> 46:54.386
and we've worked together
peacefully throughout.

46:54.440 --> 46:55.871
But these payments

46:55.920 --> 46:59.945
in these envelopes. They only
cover you for cock and cum.

47:00.040 --> 47:02.791
They don't allow for any

47:02.880 --> 47:04.789
expansions.

47:07.720 --> 47:10.949
I'm hearing rumblings, Topan.

47:11.280 --> 47:14.543
People are talking. Seems
that you and your boys here

47:14.640 --> 47:18.062
are responsible for some powder
circulating in my father's territory.

47:18.120 --> 47:20.188
No, that?

47:20.240 --> 47:23.503
- That's just...
- You don't have to explain anything.

47:23.560 --> 47:26.140
We already know everything.

47:26.200 --> 47:28.906
Now, taking into account
this new enterprise of yours

47:28.960 --> 47:32.143
and the fact you sure as hell
don't want some pig's knuckles

47:32.240 --> 47:35.742
rapping at your door,
the price just went up.

47:37.160 --> 47:39.581
All you have to do is dig
just a little bit deeper.

47:39.640 --> 47:42.789
Then we can forgive you
this minor indiscretion.

47:44.520 --> 47:48.067
Now if you would be so
kind, this envelope,

47:48.880 --> 47:51.187
it's still a little light.

50:58.960 --> 51:00.744
He did good.

51:00.800 --> 51:02.823
Hounded him down
quickly and cleanly.

51:02.880 --> 51:05.142
You'd swear he's been
doing it all his life.

51:05.200 --> 51:06.711
Didn't take a wrong step.

51:09.160 --> 51:10.830
Okay.

51:14.040 --> 51:16.791
Uco, give this to the kid.

51:20.240 --> 51:22.820
You handled the
situation well today.

51:22.880 --> 51:26.462
They deserved it. You were right.

51:27.560 --> 51:29.469
Keep it up.

51:30.240 --> 51:33.105
- Thank you, sir.
- Okay.

51:39.920 --> 51:42.705
Sir?

51:43.200 --> 51:45.871
I was wondering,

51:45.920 --> 51:48.307
what with the way
things have been...

51:49.360 --> 51:52.509
Maybe it's time for me to start taking
on a little more responsibility.

51:52.560 --> 51:54.742
Maybe handle some of our more...

51:54.840 --> 51:56.510
Hold on.

51:59.120 --> 52:02.542
When the time comes,
I'll know. But it's not now.

52:02.920 --> 52:04.021
Not yet.

52:05.920 --> 52:07.465
Okay?

52:14.440 --> 52:15.746
Anything else?

52:17.760 --> 52:18.861
No.

52:19.880 --> 52:22.790
Okay, thank you, Uco.

52:25.240 --> 52:27.183
Thank you.

52:51.880 --> 52:54.381

52:57.760 --> 52:59.908
Would you like a drink?

52:59.960 --> 53:02.142
No, I'm fine, thanks.

53:05.640 --> 53:07.469
Come on, man, drink a little.

53:07.520 --> 53:10.624
- Pour the man a drink.
- I'm fine, I've had enough.

53:11.320 --> 53:15.903
If you won't drink, then sing at least.
You've been quiet since you got here.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.068
Don't worry about me,
I'll just watch.

53:18.200 --> 53:20.587
Fuck, you don't drink,

53:20.640 --> 53:24.028
you won't sing. You should have
told me earlier. We could be

53:24.080 --> 53:27.229
at a titty bar hooking up with Uzbeki
girls instead of sweating in here.

53:27.280 --> 53:29.542
They only have cheap skanks.

53:29.640 --> 53:31.981
Hey, who the fuck are
you calling skanks?

53:32.000 --> 53:35.309
I'm better than you, and you
should know that already.

53:35.360 --> 53:36.950
- Prick.
- Joanna, don't.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.704
No, no, it's okay.

53:39.440 --> 53:41.030
Joanna,

53:41.080 --> 53:44.582
I'm the kind of guy that
you should be afraid of.

53:44.640 --> 53:45.980
Just look at her.

53:47.880 --> 53:50.745
- Oh, yeah?! And who the fuck are you?
- It's like this.

53:51.680 --> 53:55.307
The place you work,
the place where you live.

53:55.360 --> 53:58.066
The place where you
fuck your clients,

53:58.120 --> 54:00.791
my father owns all of it.

54:00.880 --> 54:04.223
And it's my job to make sure that
everyone who works in this city

54:04.280 --> 54:06.428
remembers to show
their appreciation.

54:06.480 --> 54:08.821
So you're a debt collector?

54:11.920 --> 54:14.830
- Fuck it, I'll sing, give me the mike.
- No.

54:14.880 --> 54:18.143
Let her talk. She's a big girl,

54:18.200 --> 54:20.223
she can say what she wants.

54:20.280 --> 54:21.506
Exactly.

54:24.520 --> 54:28.181
Go ahead, keep drinking.
It'll numb the pain for later.

54:28.640 --> 54:30.310
What did you just say?

54:32.440 --> 54:34.383
I said,

54:34.440 --> 54:36.065
it's your turn to sing.

54:36.120 --> 54:38.666
I don't want to sing, I want
to know what you just said.

54:38.720 --> 54:41.710
Just fucking sing! I'm tired
of listening to you, skank!

54:42.040 --> 54:44.347
Yeah, that's you! Come on, sing!

54:44.400 --> 54:48.107
I'm paying you to either sing
or fuck. Which is it? Pick one!

54:48.160 --> 54:50.103
You wanna sing?
Okay, let's pick a song.

54:50.160 --> 54:52.467
Want me to pick a song?
Where's the fucking songbook?

54:52.520 --> 54:54.987
Quick, we're waiting to sing.

54:55.040 --> 54:57.268
Hey! Don't fucking touch that!

54:57.320 --> 54:58.751
Don't you fucking dare!

55:09.920 --> 55:13.024
This is the problem
with this country.

55:13.120 --> 55:16.941
Everyone promises everything.
Everything's yes, yes, yes!

55:17.040 --> 55:19.586
But when the time comes
to collect, it all changes.

55:19.640 --> 55:22.061
"Oh, I'm sorry, I can't.
No, no." Bullshit!

55:22.120 --> 55:23.506
But not tonight!

55:24.440 --> 55:27.430
Now, sing.

55:30.120 --> 55:32.826
♪ Somewhere ♪♪

55:44.120 --> 55:47.110
Is everything okay here, sir?

55:47.920 --> 55:50.022
No, we're all good.

55:50.520 --> 55:51.906
Everything's fine.

55:51.960 --> 55:54.791
Is everything fine?

55:54.840 --> 55:57.227
- You see. We're all happy here.
- Please let me go!

55:57.280 --> 56:01.180
- Close the door on your way out.
- Let me go.

56:02.440 --> 56:03.587
Take the girls with you.

56:09.720 --> 56:11.151
Uco.

56:19.800 --> 56:21.311
Get out!

56:31.960 --> 56:33.824
Tonight

56:34.520 --> 56:36.270
is on us, sir.

56:36.880 --> 56:38.664
Thank you.

56:50.920 --> 56:52.021
Are you okay?

56:53.000 --> 56:56.582
I'm fine, I don't care
what some hooker says.

56:57.720 --> 57:01.108
It's that she had the fucking nerve
to think she was allowed to say it.

57:05.280 --> 57:07.382
I'm more than that.

57:07.480 --> 57:09.708
More than all this.

57:11.720 --> 57:14.664
It's my fucking time, Yuda. And
I want my father to know that.

57:14.720 --> 57:17.266
- It won't be long now.
- Oh, yeah? When?

57:28.880 --> 57:30.982
Wait here.

57:43.320 --> 57:44.831
Hello?

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:09.950
I've seen many a man
fall before they should.

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:12.581
They could have lasted
a little longer

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:15.220
had they known when to stop.

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:17.950
But they don't.

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:21.502
In the end,

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.751
they all end up in the same place.

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:27.389
The same shallow ditch.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.381
Under the same river.

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:32.350
Fill it with rocks.

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.509
That's the proof.

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:44.061
If you choose to follow
us, you follow us.

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:45.745
Simple as that.

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:49.902
They burn out real fast.

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:53.667
I see it in Uco.

01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:58.065
I've tried to ignore it,
but it didn't work.

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:00.348
I know Uco has that fire.

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:07.582
I had to lose a lot in my life before I
could truly see that that was important.

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.911
I don't want the same
to happen to my boy.

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:14.189
He won't, sir.

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:17.264
The time I've known him, he
speaks nothing but highly of you.

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:21.068
I hope you're right.

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:23.621
But I know what my gut tells me.

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:28.861
Lately you're his shadow.

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:31.182
So take care of him.

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:35.385
If you see anything
weird, you tell me.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:39.424
Otherwise, it's like I said,

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:43.346
falling in the same ditch
under the same river.

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:49.021
Hm. I hope for your
sake you can swim.

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:57.864
Toss them back in.
Nothing tastes good here.

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:27.503
The main difference between you
and I can be defined by one word.

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:29.909
Legacy.

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:36.391
Every step I take is a step
forward for my group and family.

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:40.465
Every step that you take

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:44.426
is cloaked in the
shadow of your father.

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.222
In my life,

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:52.821
I never have to follow
anyone's rules.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.343
No expectations of
who I should become.

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:01.342
No rules to abide by.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.704
My father,

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:10.627
he was a fucking road sweeper.

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:15.263
Shining shoes would have made me
a success story compared to him.

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:17.983
So, yes,

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.541
you and I, we couldn't
be more different.

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:24.902
But deep inside, our
ambitions are the same.

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:28.741
After all, you came here
of your own accord.

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:43.829
Now we've eaten well,
drank good wine,

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:47.143
there's one thing that you
should know about me.

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:50.944
If I'm the type of person who
likes to impose my will,

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.024
I would've already pointed
a gun at your head.

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:00.511
But no, that's not me.

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:02.949
Not today at least.

01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:09.387
Today I'm offering you a gift.

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:13.390
An opportunity.

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:19.866
Something that has never been
given to you by your father.

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:22.547
Please.

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:02.471
Those prison gates opened
and not one person

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:05.305
from your group was
there to pick them up.

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:08.224
I was surprised.

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:12.348
Imagine

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:16.630
how surprised they were when
they found out I picked them up

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:18.788
and brought them here

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:21.466
for you.

01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:28.671
That's my gift.

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:33.101
I give you the opportunity...

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:37.067
to claim revenge.

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:52.661
And after that?

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:58.062
We talk business.

01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:09.071
Just so you know,

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:12.781
- if you need financial help...
- I need labor.

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:15.546
Oh, that I can do.

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:17.622
So, what do you want exactly?

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:20.225
I've got my eye on
this patch of land.

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:22.982
Whose land?

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:26.350
That's why I need your help.

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:31.267
There are only two possibilities.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.340
I'm sorry.

01:08:33.399 --> 01:08:35.468
But with all due respect,

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:37.384
if I wanted to rent a patch of land

01:08:37.439 --> 01:08:40.828
fair and square, I'd be
meeting your father.

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:43.390
Not you.

01:08:46.279 --> 01:08:48.064
It belongs to the Japanese.

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:50.346
Huh.

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:03.743
The spot is perfect for
me to start my business.

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:06.261
Then why are you meeting with me?

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:10.627
It's their land.

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.907
My father would never allow it.

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:22.586
He would never do anything
to disrupt the truce.

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:24.787
I'm not interested in
what your father thinks.

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:27.783
I need your support,
and if I can be frank,

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:30.307
it seems you need my support also.

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.265
What do you mean?

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:36.549
I heard the top brass aren't
happy with your father anymore.

01:09:37.479 --> 01:09:41.107
Times are changing. The Goto family
is starting to make connections.

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:43.546
Top connections.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.783
When your father leaves the
office, he goes home, he sleeps.

01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:50.990
Meanwhile, Goto's boy is taking
Reza to a club and partying.

01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:52.341
Just so you know...

01:09:52.399 --> 01:09:57.540
It's easy to sway a cop or a politician
with a little cash and a lot of pussy.

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.908
What do you want?

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:07.509
Give me your word, and I'll
put an end to the truce.

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:12.826
Put your faith in me and I'll tip the
odds in your favor when the war begins.

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:14.186
Let them all see

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:19.267
how you took charge and made your
family bigger than it's ever been.

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:22.669
And you? What's in it for you?

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:26.831
Everyone has their limit.

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:32.350
After we take over Goto's territory, I just
want a small patch that I can use freely

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:35.307
without having to pay anyone.

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:36.666
No questions asked.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.502
And how do you propose to
start a war between us?

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:44.788
Not a drop of blood has been
spilled in over 10 years.

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:46.709
Well, that would have to change.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.307
- Unh! Unh! Unh!
- Shh, shh, shh.

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:56.265
Shh, shh...

01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:58.384
Good boy.

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:40.187
If you expect my father
to put his men to war

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:41.501
with the Gotos,

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:44.664
it'll take a lot more than just
the death of foot soldiers.

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:48.506
I already have someone in mind.

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:57.303
Okay, so same time next month.

01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:00.061
Uh, Dwi, wait.

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:02.421
What is it?

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:06.229
- What about Karim?
- What about him?

01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:07.506
Dwi.

01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:09.025
You promised.

01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:11.706
I said when the time is right.

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:12.947
Not yet.

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:20.027
His friends come here often, 'Koso.

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:24.908
Do you think he wants to explain
to them that this is his father?

01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:29.101
You don't have to
do that, I get it.

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:33.584
- But I haven't seen him since he was...
- Yeah, and whose choice was that?

01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:36.903
Yours, right? You're the one
who chose to do what you do.

01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:40.108
To support you.

01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:43.622
There are millions of fathers in the
world supporting their families.

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:46.306
Only they don't come home
with blood on their hands.

01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:49.464
Do you even realize that what you
do is so fucking disgusting?

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.070
- I'm not a smart man.
- No, you're not.

01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:59.549
But you used to be a good person.

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:04.069
That means that I still have the
right to see my son, right?

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:08.144
That's the thing, you don't.

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:09.347
Not like this.

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:13.504
And I don't want to hear anymore
about you wanting to change.

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:17.221
Because it's been 15 years already,
and I barely recognize you anymore.

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:40.663
I'm sorry, I have to go.

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:44.188
As always.

01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:47.511
Crazy.

01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:50.504
Seems anyone can get
in here these days.

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:52.185
Way back this place had class.

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:54.741
But now you see white guys
walking around in sandals

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:58.347
drinking beer and fucking cheap skanks
in the toilets like fucking animals.

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.901
It's a fucking disgrace.

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:04.348
Everything has to be restarted from
the beginning. Starting from us.

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:05.990
Like it was before.

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:10.029
Back then, if my father turned
up, the room would freeze.

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:11.944
They'd fear him

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.068
because they knew he
could do anything.

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:16.588
Times change.

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:20.586
They may not fear him
like they used to,

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:23.141
but your father hasn't lost
that fire in his stomach.

01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:27.425
He just learned how to control it.
They respect him now.

01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:29.423
He doesn't need fear anymore.

01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:32.663
He has their respect and
that's what counts the most.

01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:34.060
It used to count.

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:36.985
Used to. Not anymore.

01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:39.507
Times change faster than you think.

01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:42.550
We got people now who don't
give a shit about back then.

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:44.190
They only care about now.

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:47.184
Respect? That doesn't
mean shit to them.

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:51.186
That ain't new. We faced punks like that
more times than I care to remember.

01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:53.304
Trust me,

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:55.542
they don't last.

01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:59.982
And when it's your turn to take the
reins, you'll see for yourself.

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:03.622
They'll burn and fall in front of you
just like they did for your father.

01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:06.984
That same fire is in you.

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:09.381
I've seen it ever since
you were a child.

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:12.070
Don't ever lose it.

01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.149
Learn to control it.

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:17.782
If you do, one day you'll
become as great as your father.

01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:24.024
'Koso,

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:26.786
you've always been a
good friend to us.

01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:29.068
Your father has always
taken good care of me.

01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:32.668
To family.

01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:42.063
I'll be right back, gotta piss.

01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:53.745
Argh!

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:55.347
The Chinks say they saw the Japs
attacking 'Koso in that alleyway.

01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:57.190
Can you believe that shit?

01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:01.187
After all this time, they fuck us
like this? We have to respond.

01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:04.429
Busting some heads and going to
war are two very different things.

01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:08.749
Prakoso's line of work
made him enemies.

01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:11.870
Not just the Gotos. Hell, even
the Chinese wanted his head.

01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:14.781
This wasn't the first time
he'd been under attack.

01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:17.185
Sadly it was the last.

01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:22.186
- Where the fuck have you been?
- What happened?

01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:25.664
After everything he did for us,

01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:27.862
this is how we repay him?

01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:31.706
All 'Koso ever cared for
in the world was his wife

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:33.464
and kid.

01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:39.661
He had no time for
making things personal.

01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:42.551
So from now, our duty is to
take care of his family.

01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:44.987
But we will not retaliate.

01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:51.780
Are you kidding me?

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:54.786
Eka, talk some sense into him.

01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:56.908
We're losing our hold here.

01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:59.146
Sir,

01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:01.746
we have ruled this territory
for over 30 years!

01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:05.501
And my decision on this will
see us through 30 more!

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:07.150
Stand down.

01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:09.667
Cool off! Relax.

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:14.744
You should remember

01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:17.380
your place.

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:22.545
Uco.

01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:28.471
Yuda...

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:33.946
watch over him, take him out,

01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:36.711
make him forget about this.
Find him a girl,

01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:38.749
so he'll get his mind off this.

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:42.110
Yes, boss.

01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:55.301
Unbelievable.

01:26:58.080 --> 01:26:59.420
Eka...

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:04.469
this is no good.

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:07.388
No good at all.

01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:13.940
Uco.

01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:16.590
Uco.

01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:21.101
- What's wrong?
- Who the fuck do you think you are?

01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:22.341
Your father's right.

01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:25.549
If you rush into this it won't
help, it will make things worse.

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:27.702
Well, you've grown all of a sudden.

01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:29.504
This is a shitty situation,

01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:32.061
but you have to refrain yourself.
I've lost control before,

01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:34.700
and look where it got me.

01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:37.820
Look where it got you? It got you a
fucking penthouse suite that I pay for.

01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:39.749
I'm just trying to help,
I know how much your father...

01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:41.629
Shut the fuck up!

01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:43.828
Who the fuck do you
think you are? Huh?

01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:46.142
You think you know my father?

01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:48.109
You mean nothing to him.

01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:50.906
We only owed you and
we paid it back.

01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:54.428
After that, we're just
going to cut you free.

01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:57.584
What? Did you expect more?

01:27:58.320 --> 01:27:59.945
Go fuck yourself.

01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:18.631
- Did we get the okay?
- Fuck the okay.

01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:20.703
Just do it.

01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:02.311
Do it.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.751
Time for work.

01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:12.385
How many?

01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:14.381
A few.

01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:14.828
Please, have mercy.

01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:06.186
Give me the ball.

01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:19.861
That was a mistake.

01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:23.581
No, wait, don't!

01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:27.271
No!

01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:57.420
- Where to?
- Tanah Abang.

01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:08.505
Enough.

01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:11.105
Now

01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:13.501
everything has to stop.

01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:17.222
Mr. Goto.

01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:19.509
Mr. Bangun.

01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:21.389
We acknowledge...

01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:24.744
this conflict

01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:28.109
between your groups

01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:31.150
is the first one in 10 years.

01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:34.424
There are many casualties.

01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:40.743
If this continues,

01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:44.386
we will disband both
of your groups.

01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:46.622
We only acted in retaliation.

01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:50.990
Retaliation? And how the fuck you
explain what happened to Prakoso?

01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:53.383
That was never an order of ours.

01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:56.271
Those men had no ties
to my father's group.

01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:58.422
Oh, yeah. Who was it?

01:39:58.480 --> 01:39:59.911
Maybe you know.

01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:07.589
Sir,

01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:09.629
with all due respect,

01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:12.989
but the man you're talking about
was like a brother to my father

01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:17.668
and uncle to me. A man of loyalty
to our family for over 30 years.

01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:19.060
If you speak ill of him again,

01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:21.302
- I swear to God...
- Enough!

01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:23.269
Only a fool

01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:26.663
argues for the pride of a dead man.

01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:29.905
Mr. Goto,

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.101
my apologies.

01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:33.786
It's fine.

01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:38.380
I accept full responsibility
for all that has happened.

01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:39.905
What?

01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:44.581
It seems decisions have been made
by members of my organization

01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:46.305
who are less intelligent

01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:48.110
and less experienced.

01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:49.910
For that I can only apologize.

01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:52.108
And for all that has
happened this past week.

01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:53.830
I will pay all the damages.

01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:56.904
To prevent bloodshed
between our families.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:03.025
Thank you for your
swift resolution.

01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:06.627
Yeah. Now, gentlemen,
if you'll excuse me.

01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:08.828
I have to go back
to my organization.

01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:10.550
Of course.

01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:12.384
Excuse me.

01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:35.471
I heard what happened,
are you okay?

01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:37.861
What the fuck is going on?

01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:40.950
Why are the cops attacking me?
Who the fuck made that call?

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:42.784
Calm down.

01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:46.666
So far everything seems to suggest
this was purely territorial.

01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:49.147
Seems Reza has his men
supporting the Goto family.

01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:52.065
- Pull me out now.
- I'm afraid I can't do that.

01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:55.420
What do you mean, you can't?
What have I not witnessed?

01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:57.384
Murder, extortion, bribery?

01:42:57.480 --> 01:42:58.741
Corruption.

01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:02.621
You were never investigating
Bangun, you knew that.

01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:05.386
We want the cops they pay.

01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:08.589
You think you're alone in this?
This isn't your show.

01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:10.742
None of us are heroes.

01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:14.871
We're all caught in
a big fucking web.

01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:16.431
Listen.

01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:19.231
Your identity is safe.

01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:52.871
Yuda, where the fuck have you been?
I've been trying to reach you.

01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:55.421
Get your ass to the office now
and get Uco the fuck out.

01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:56.901
I can't hold back Bangun anymore.

01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:27.628
Do you realize how many men we lost
just to play your fucking game? Huh?

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.068
Everything I've built was for you.

01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:35.582
Everything was for you!
And you brought it to the ground.

01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:38.425
You destroyed it completely. Huh?

01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:40.907
And for what?

01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:44.668
For what?

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:47.261
Huh?

01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:49.821
Tell me why. Huh? Huh?

01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:52.142
Come on, tell me.

01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:53.301
For what?

01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:56.191
Please, Dad, please...
Listen to me... Dad, please...

01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:58.263
Dad, listen.

01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:01.151
- For what?
- Fuck!

01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:05.021
You say you're ashamed of me,
well, I'm ashamed of you!

01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:07.342
What the fuck was
that back there? Huh?

01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:09.861
Where's your self-respect?

01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:13.184
Apologizing to those motherfuckers.

01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:15.223
And in their language,

01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:17.986
on our land!

01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:22.344
You want to know what
drove me to this?

01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:27.384
I'm tired. Tired of waiting.

01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:32.145
I'm tired watching you just
sit back and do nothing.

01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:38.585
You had your moment. But where's
mine? What the fuck do I get?

01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:42.785
Shaking down junkies
for bit change?

01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:46.103
That's not the role
of a future boss.

01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:49.504
That's not work you give a boss!

01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:53.746
You've destroyed us.

01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:56.267
You've destroyed everything.

01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:03.188
Dad.

01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:07.629
Dad, everything we've lost,

01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:09.703
we can get back.

01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:12.187
We can get it all back.

01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:14.820
Dad, trust in me, I can fix this.

01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:19.030
I can fix this.

01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:22.664
Okay, that's enough.

01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:25.744
Enough.

01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:36.707
Eka, prepare a peace
package for the Gotos.

01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:39.386
We'll give them our land
in Menteng and Sabang.

01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:40.667
Got it?

01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:42.663
Yes, boss.

01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:51.907
You can't go in there. He's in...

01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:19.142
Forgive me.

01:47:55.880 --> 01:47:57.106
You fucking traitor.

01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:15.582
How could you do this, Uco?

01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:45.510
Eka, run!

01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:24.907
What do you want to do with him?

01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:34.463
Take him.

01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:23.824
What's that?

01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:29.744
Yeah, I understand.

01:57:31.160 --> 01:57:33.945
I'll call you back.

01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:49.465
Reza was just seen entering
Bejo's restaurant.

01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:55.027
I thought we'd secured
his services.

01:57:55.720 --> 01:57:58.551
That was my understanding.

01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:06.386
Then why the fuck
is he meeting Bejo?

01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:16.711
Well?

01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:19.709
Bejo

01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:23.387
is a fucking nobody,
take care of him now.

01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:28.586
- As for Reza and the rest of them...
- Boss, wait.

01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:35.751
Bejo's not alone.

01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:39.224
He has Uco with him.

01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:43.550
Seems they joined forces

01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:45.668
after taking out Bangun.

01:58:48.280 --> 01:58:50.303
Point blank to the head.

01:58:53.040 --> 01:58:54.790
Bejo

01:58:55.480 --> 01:58:58.390
has serious numbers now.

01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:01.022
He's becoming a genuine threat.

01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:03.547
Heh.

01:59:04.280 --> 01:59:06.667
Anything is possible.

01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:09.906
What should we do?

01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:12.381
We go to war!

01:59:13.400 --> 01:59:15.980
If he pulled a trigger
on his own father,

01:59:16.760 --> 01:59:19.386
he won't hesitate to come for us.

01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:22.662
We start over.

01:59:25.880 --> 01:59:28.062
I want Uco and Bejo in
the ground by tonight.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:31.620
Reza and the rest of
those crooks too.

01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:33.868
Wait a minute, you
can't be serious.

01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:38.147
They're not cops anymore.

01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:41.548
They're in my world now.

02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:05.509
Eka! Eka!

02:00:11.520 --> 02:00:13.907
I know who you are.

02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:15.300
I know where you're from.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.228
I told you before...

02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:27.866
we come from the same place.

02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:32.304
I hope...

02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:35.747
Our fates don't end up the same.

02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:41.582
I don't care what they say.

02:00:43.640 --> 02:00:45.663
I'm not a traitor.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:47.670
I'm not a fucking criminal.

02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:53.429
There's no end to this.

02:00:55.200 --> 02:00:56.790
You try to run...

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.068
they hound you down.

02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:04.902
They lose a head?

02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:08.948
It just grows right fucking back.

02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:14.389
If you want out...

02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:19.268
you put them down.

02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:23.661
All of them.

02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:32.106
Eka, wait.

02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:41.309
Why the fuck didn't you tell me you had
an undercover in there with Bangun?

02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:43.144
What are you talking about?

02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:44.790
Eka.

02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:46.430
That piece of shit?

02:02:46.480 --> 02:02:48.264
That piece of shit saved my life.

02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:54.109
Yeah, he also cost the lives of 10
honest cops when he fed us bad intel.

02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:56.627
He went rogue, Rama.

02:02:56.720 --> 02:02:59.824
And it never crossed your
mind to mention it to me?

02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:03.429
Now's not the time for this.
The commissioner is dead.

02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:05.782
Fucking bodies are piling
up all over the city.

02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:09.381
There's no such thing as
a clean war, lieutenant.

02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:12.868
Maybe not. But we can
trace it to Reza.

02:03:12.920 --> 02:03:15.307
We picked him up on Uco's wire.

02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:18.830
They're together?

02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:20.744
As far as we know.

02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:24.825
We lost the signal,
but we're on our way.

02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:30.501
I'm going to ask you one question.

02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:32.742
And it's the only answer I want.

02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:35.150
Is my family safe?

02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:37.223
Yes, of course.

02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:41.710
- Keep them that way.
- Wait, Rama, wait...

02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:50.269
Watch over me.

02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:43.707
Sir, would you like a tissue?

02:06:43.760 --> 02:06:45.624
You better come here if you
want your fucking tip.

02:06:45.680 --> 02:06:47.430
Yes, sir.

02:06:53.040 --> 02:06:54.665
I'm sorry, sir.

02:07:25.560 --> 02:07:28.743
Of course we can.

02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:30.948
We're the ones who will set it up.

02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:35.229
The important thing is the reward.

02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:38.509
New faces. New prices.

02:07:38.560 --> 02:07:40.185
New prices?

02:07:40.240 --> 02:07:43.071
Come on, Reza.

02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:46.064
Just think of it as
a probation period.

02:07:47.600 --> 02:07:49.828
How much did Goto pay you?

02:07:50.120 --> 02:07:52.746
That's not a smart question to ask.

02:07:52.800 --> 02:07:55.870
Oh, yeah, and why's that?

02:07:55.920 --> 02:07:59.422
Because I'm meeting you, not him.

02:07:59.520 --> 02:08:01.543
Now think up a number.

02:08:01.600 --> 02:08:05.227
If it keeps me here after
dinner, then it's enough. Hm?

02:08:09.720 --> 02:08:12.221
Hey, sidekick.

02:08:13.640 --> 02:08:16.107
You're talkative.

02:08:16.600 --> 02:08:18.145
Hm?

02:08:24.840 --> 02:08:26.863
Boss.

02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:29.148
He escaped from the car.

02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:34.030
Put the word out.

02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:36.660
Whoever finds him will be...

02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:38.310
He's here.

02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:40.383
He's coming up.

02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:45.310
- Then hold him off.
- Yes, boss.

02:08:47.240 --> 02:08:48.546
Everything okay?

02:08:53.160 --> 02:08:54.341
Take care of it.

02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:07.349
Reza,

02:09:08.160 --> 02:09:09.307
don't worry.

02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:11.906
Everything is under control.

02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:13.471
They are more than capable of...

02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:18.224
Motherfucker.

02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:43.501
Give me the ball.

02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:53.031
As usual.

02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:15.951
No!

02:20:23.800 --> 02:20:24.947
Ah...

02:20:34.560 --> 02:20:36.230
Reza!

02:25:43.440 --> 02:25:44.701
No...

02:25:47.640 --> 02:25:48.866
I'm done.
