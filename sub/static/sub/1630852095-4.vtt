WEBVTT

00:01.125 --> 00:02.125
Sorry, Santa.

00:06.333 --> 00:09.875
Nathaniel? What are you doin', buddy?
Hey, is everything okay?

00:13.333 --> 00:15.875
Hey. You know
I'm gonna be there, like I said.

00:17.250 --> 00:19.875
So Ronin is dead,
and the person who killed him is dead.

00:19.958 --> 00:22.000
That's convenient. How do you know this?

00:22.083 --> 00:23.083
'Cause I was there.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.458
MAN: Up next, we have an artifact

00:25.750 --> 00:29.250
recovered from the wreckage
of the Avengers compound.

00:29.625 --> 00:30.666
MAN: The lots.

00:34.375 --> 00:36.125
REPORTER: New York socialite
Armand Duquesne

00:36.208 --> 00:38.208
was found dead in his home last night.

00:38.333 --> 00:41.125
This is Detective Caudie
of the New York Police Department.

00:41.208 --> 00:44.166
Ms. Bishop, can you come down
to the station for a quick chat?

00:45.208 --> 00:46.416
How'd you say Armand was killed?

00:46.541 --> 00:47.625
Stabbed with a sword.

00:47.750 --> 00:49.333
BARTON: See if there's anything on Kazi.

00:49.416 --> 00:52.625
KATE: Okay, what's this company,
Sloan Limited? Kazi is an employee?

00:53.375 --> 00:55.208
Let me see what I can pull up on Jack.

00:56.625 --> 00:57.916
And I've just been locked out.

00:59.375 --> 01:00.375
JACK: Don't move.

01:40.916 --> 01:43.875
Stay exactly where you are.

01:43.958 --> 01:45.416
Jack, no!

01:45.583 --> 01:47.375
What the hell is going on?

01:48.458 --> 01:50.750
And why is there an Avenger
in my dining room?

01:51.083 --> 01:52.166
Hi.

01:52.250 --> 01:55.458
Oh, my God. You're... You're Archer.

01:55.583 --> 01:56.958
-Hawkeye.
-Clint.

01:57.041 --> 01:59.791
-It's the branding issue, I'm telling you.
-Yeah, sure.

02:08.083 --> 02:11.708
Hawkeye and I are working on a case,
and we needed to use the bathroom.

02:11.791 --> 02:15.333
He did. So, we were by the house,
we dropped in. No big deal.

02:15.500 --> 02:17.416
-Working on a case together?
-How terrific.

02:18.416 --> 02:19.958
He's my partner.

02:20.291 --> 02:21.583
We're not partners.

02:21.666 --> 02:24.125
Well, we're friends-slash-partners.

02:24.208 --> 02:25.833
I wouldn't really describe us as friends.

02:28.166 --> 02:32.916
Someone used my laptop to sign onto
my work account ten minutes ago.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.583
Any thoughts, Kate?

02:36.458 --> 02:37.708
Hawkeye?

02:37.791 --> 02:40.416
You'll never get anything outta him.

02:40.500 --> 02:42.583
See, CB-One has trouble opening up.

02:42.666 --> 02:43.958
Nobody calls me CB-One.

02:44.125 --> 02:45.666
I'm just tryin' it out for a second.

02:45.750 --> 02:49.375
Probably some early childhood thing.
He thinks he doesn't tell me much,

02:49.458 --> 02:51.791
-but he ends up telling me all of it.
-I tell her nothing.

02:51.875 --> 02:53.916
I think it's 'cause
I'm generally pretty chill.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.750
I'm not like, "Oh, my God, Hawkeye!"

02:57.291 --> 02:58.458
Definitely not chill.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.375
By the way, thank you...
for saving the world.

03:05.833 --> 03:06.833
Don't mention it.

03:06.916 --> 03:09.833
I would like my daughter
to start telling me the truth.

03:11.458 --> 03:14.458
I logged into your account
because I needed information

03:14.541 --> 03:18.916
on an actual case with actual people
who are in actual danger.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.916
So, Kate is helping you
with an Avengers-level threat?

03:23.083 --> 03:24.416
Well, not exactly.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.208
But you are working together?

03:31.541 --> 03:35.291
Yes. Sounds weird, 'cause it is.

03:37.875 --> 03:39.125
Okay.

03:40.291 --> 03:44.916
Well, I guess I'm just gonna have to trust
everyone at this table to do what's right.

03:45.541 --> 03:46.625
BARTON: Hmm.

03:48.333 --> 03:50.416
Cool. It was great bumpin' into you guys.

03:50.500 --> 03:51.833
-Please stay.
-We should get...

03:55.208 --> 03:56.333
Can I see you out?

03:57.291 --> 03:58.916
I'll get my coat. Jack.

04:14.666 --> 04:16.000
Let me clarify.

04:16.083 --> 04:17.083
Yeah.

04:18.375 --> 04:19.958
She is not a superhero.

04:20.666 --> 04:22.166
Oh, yeah. Come on,
I already knew that.

04:23.250 --> 04:24.833
She's pretty good at all this, but...

04:24.916 --> 04:27.791
Natasha Romanoff was pretty damn good
at it, wasn't she?

04:29.916 --> 04:32.333
Being good isn't always enough
to keep you alive.

04:36.041 --> 04:37.041
I see.

04:37.125 --> 04:38.166
-Clint?
-Yeah?

04:38.250 --> 04:39.250
Do you have kids?

04:40.333 --> 04:42.041
Yeah, I'm gonna assume that you do.

04:43.041 --> 04:45.291
It's been a rough week for my family.

04:46.625 --> 04:50.166
But I am letting you know
that I cannot lose Kate.

04:51.541 --> 04:54.916
I've lost people before. I know
in your line of work, you have, too.

04:56.791 --> 04:59.208
I understand. Okay.

05:02.166 --> 05:03.583
So, you'll forget this case?

05:04.375 --> 05:05.375
I can't do that.

05:06.375 --> 05:09.708
But what I can do is ensure that
your daughter stays safe. Okay?

05:40.166 --> 05:42.541
It's Eleanor. Um...

05:43.250 --> 05:46.041
Could you call me back, please?
It's urgent.

05:48.791 --> 05:50.666
Hey. Did you find anything?

05:51.375 --> 05:55.000
I talked to that friend of yours.
He's really busy.

05:55.083 --> 05:58.416
He's been learning Russian
and jogging a ton.

05:59.166 --> 06:01.541
Tracksuits. So Sloan is their front?

06:01.625 --> 06:05.541
Yep. He said that his boss, Jack Duquesne,
never gives him a day off.

06:05.625 --> 06:08.875
Jack's CEO?
He's laundering money for the big guy?

06:09.250 --> 06:11.416
Let me guess,
you're gonna need another day.

06:12.083 --> 06:15.583
Yeah, look, uh, this kid I'm helping
is stuck in the middle of it,

06:15.666 --> 06:17.416
so I can't leave until I know she's safe.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.416
I've been wondering...

06:21.541 --> 06:22.583
BARTON: You mean the Rolex?

06:24.875 --> 06:25.875
It's Dad.

06:28.041 --> 06:30.541
I don't think... I don't think so.

06:32.500 --> 06:35.208
Why? Wasn't that destroyed,
like, years ago?

06:35.291 --> 06:38.958
Well, I thought so, but I thought
the same thing about your fancy outfit.

06:41.166 --> 06:42.666
It's worth lookin' into, ain't it?

06:42.875 --> 06:45.541
If you can, check the signal
from the transmitter.

06:45.791 --> 06:48.625
Okay. You sound like you've been
runnin' around all day. Are you tired?

06:48.791 --> 06:51.750
Yeah, I'm a little banged up,
but nothing's broken.

06:51.833 --> 06:53.833
Okay. Well, put your feet up.

06:53.916 --> 06:57.166
Ice them if you have to. Okay? I love you.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.708
I... I miss you.

07:00.416 --> 07:02.458
I'll see you soon. I promise.

07:02.541 --> 07:03.541
Bye.

07:04.500 --> 07:08.416
Uh, guys, looks like Dad's gonna be
stuck at work a little longer.

07:12.541 --> 07:16.958
ELEANOR: Obsessed. Completely obsessed
with Clint Barton since...

07:17.291 --> 07:19.208
Well, ever since the attack.

07:19.333 --> 07:21.875
JACK: She's awfully composed
around her own idol.

07:21.958 --> 07:24.416
If I ever met Huey Lewis, I'd be a wreck.

07:25.458 --> 07:27.333
ELEANOR: Kate's always been confident,

07:27.416 --> 07:29.416
never had to worry
about her on that front.

07:34.291 --> 07:37.750
You're getting that pre-headache look,
darling. Let me get you some tea.

07:39.416 --> 07:40.541
Would you like something, Kate?

07:41.083 --> 07:42.541
No. Thanks.

07:47.208 --> 07:49.166
Mom, I really need to
talk to you about Jack.

07:49.250 --> 07:52.291
Hey, could we... Um...
Could we change the subject?

07:52.375 --> 07:54.250
You need to give him a break. Come on.

07:54.333 --> 07:58.583
I... I need your help with a few decisions
on the Bishop holiday party.

07:58.666 --> 08:01.083
I don't... I don't think I'm in the mood.

08:01.166 --> 08:03.583
Come on, Kate.
You're great at this sort of thing.

08:04.958 --> 08:06.375
The party's non-denominational,

08:06.458 --> 08:09.500
encourages company camaraderie
with a festive spirit.

08:10.166 --> 08:11.916
Sounds like a blast already.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Did someone say parties?

08:15.166 --> 08:17.500
Just make sure there's plenty of dancing.

08:17.583 --> 08:19.125
Well, my mother doesn't dance.

08:20.208 --> 08:24.041
Oh, really? I beg to differ. Darling?

08:26.500 --> 08:30.458
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire

08:33.333 --> 08:36.375
Jack Frost nippin' at your ear

08:41.458 --> 08:46.416
And though it's been said
many times, many ways

08:46.500 --> 08:53.166
Merry Christmas to you

08:54.333 --> 08:56.333
Don't think I've ever seen you
like that before.

08:58.375 --> 08:59.916
Wow!

09:00.458 --> 09:04.458
A superhero house call and a serenade,
all in one day.

09:04.541 --> 09:07.875
Well, you know what they say...
life is short.

09:08.833 --> 09:10.708
You never know what you're gonna get.

09:14.625 --> 09:19.000
What? What'd I say?
Did I say something wrong or...

09:19.083 --> 09:23.666
Every time you use one of those aphorisms,
they are... wrong.

09:24.583 --> 09:29.208
What? No. That can't be right, is it?
Darling. Please.

09:30.583 --> 09:35.083
The other day, you said,
"Absence makes the heart grow older."

09:35.666 --> 09:38.083
-Because that's what it does.

09:38.916 --> 09:42.708
Yeah. Honey. Come here.
-No. Really?

09:42.791 --> 09:45.166
Aw. You're making my heart grow older.

09:50.500 --> 09:53.541
I guess getting laughed at by family

09:53.625 --> 09:56.500
is better than being alone
in the holidays, right?

09:56.750 --> 10:01.208
ELEANOR: What's better than being
with family? I'm so glad you're both here.

10:09.291 --> 10:11.208
JACK: You know,
we should play a board game.

10:11.291 --> 10:12.750
ELEANOR: That's a cute idea.

10:12.833 --> 10:15.250
JACK: Risk, Yahtzee, Stratego.

10:50.083 --> 10:53.041
KATE: It's me. I come bearing pizza
and holiday cheer. Let me in.

10:53.791 --> 10:54.791
Mmm.

10:56.791 --> 10:59.166
Come on, Pizza Do...
Okay.

11:00.750 --> 11:02.291
-Hey!
-Hey.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.208
-A little help?
-Hey, get outta there.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.291
All right, this is the classic Hawkeye
costume we've been waitin' for.

11:09.375 --> 11:10.458
What is all this?

11:10.541 --> 11:14.208
This is me saving the holidays.

11:14.583 --> 11:15.708
Is that right?

11:15.791 --> 11:17.625
I'll get you home in time for the big day.

11:17.833 --> 11:19.708
Figured in the meantime,
we could celebrate.

11:20.250 --> 11:25.041
It's movie marathon night, right?
Check this out. I got movies.

11:26.791 --> 11:28.458
That's very thoughtful of you.

11:29.125 --> 11:30.125
Thanks.

11:31.458 --> 11:35.458
But yeah, can we put a pause on that
and talk about Sword Boy for a minute?

11:36.041 --> 11:38.375
-You got good instincts, kid.
-What do you mean?

11:38.833 --> 11:41.166
So, I did a little digging and turns out,

11:41.500 --> 11:44.541
Sloan's a shell company
that launders money for the Tracksuits.

11:44.625 --> 11:47.375
And Jack Duquesne is the CEO.

11:47.791 --> 11:48.833
You sure?

11:49.541 --> 11:50.541
Mmm.

11:52.250 --> 11:56.125
Okay, well, we're just gonna have
to come up with a plan to take down

11:56.208 --> 11:57.958
my mom's fiancé's organized crime ring

11:58.041 --> 12:01.666
while simultaneously having
a heartwarming holiday celebration.

12:06.250 --> 12:07.833
Got any more of that slushy stuff?

12:07.916 --> 12:09.291
-BARTON: In the kitchen.
-Okay.

12:14.250 --> 12:18.083
Okay, cops. We need to get the cops
off my back.

12:18.166 --> 12:20.500
TSM, we need to get them
to leave us alone.

12:20.583 --> 12:25.666
And we need to figure out why and how
Jack is connected to it all.

12:25.750 --> 12:27.291
Yeah, right.

12:27.375 --> 12:29.791
This the part where you finish
my sentence with a plan.

12:29.875 --> 12:32.958
Planning's not really my thing.
Are you sure that's dry erase?

12:36.875 --> 12:37.875
Good boy.

12:43.166 --> 12:44.625
How do we get more trick arrows?

12:44.708 --> 12:46.583
Well, there are no more trick arrows.

12:46.666 --> 12:47.750
Like in the world?

12:47.833 --> 12:50.708
Basically. I have a few more
trick arrowheads.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.583
But you can't just put 'em on any shaft.

12:52.666 --> 12:54.166
So, we really have to get these back.

12:55.083 --> 12:56.208
What're you doing?

12:56.291 --> 12:59.291
See? Tree covers the parts
that won't come off.

12:59.833 --> 13:01.375
Well, now you're problem-solving.

13:02.250 --> 13:04.500
-Have you ever heard of boomerang arrows?
-What?

13:05.041 --> 13:08.041
Why would I ever want to use
a boomerang arrow?

13:08.125 --> 13:10.875
-Because they come back.
-Exactly.

13:10.958 --> 13:15.041
Yeah, well, if all trick arrows
were boomerangs, then we'd have them all.

13:15.666 --> 13:17.125
Coming back at us.

13:17.208 --> 13:19.833
You'd have to... You'd have to dodge.

13:21.375 --> 13:23.000
BARTON: No, it's not impossible.

13:23.083 --> 13:25.208
The first arrow you release
just has to be wood.

13:25.291 --> 13:28.083
So when you release the second one,
it splits it up the middle.

13:28.166 --> 13:31.583
-I call bullshit. I've tried it.
-Well, I've done it a few times.

13:33.583 --> 13:34.916
You got any other cool tricks?

13:36.166 --> 13:40.125
Well, I can knock somebody unconscious
with that, like, 20 feet away.

13:40.333 --> 13:41.333
No, you can't.

13:41.416 --> 13:44.083
I'd use a quarter or a nickel.
A dime's too light.

13:44.833 --> 13:45.916
Prove it.

13:46.875 --> 13:47.916
What, knock you unconscious?

13:48.000 --> 13:50.666
No, I want you to hit something.

13:51.166 --> 13:52.958
Fine, live forever
without me believing you.

13:53.041 --> 13:56.083
I'll just tell every stranger that I see
that Hawkeye is full of bullshit.

13:56.166 --> 13:57.458
-

13:57.958 --> 13:59.000
Whoa!

14:02.125 --> 14:03.875
You've got to show me how you did that.

14:10.791 --> 14:11.916
All right, you ready?

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Yeah.

14:13.250 --> 14:15.791
You have a nice snap.
Make sure you get that curve.

14:15.875 --> 14:17.708
Just a little one.
Right, you got it, right?

14:19.791 --> 14:20.791
BARTON: Oh, God.

14:22.458 --> 14:23.625
What are you doing?

14:23.958 --> 14:24.958
Ring finger.

14:26.083 --> 14:27.333
-Grip it tight.
-Yeah.

14:28.583 --> 14:29.666
That was better.

14:29.791 --> 14:31.166
You can do it this time.

14:36.875 --> 14:38.041
-KATE: Oh, my God!
-What?

14:38.416 --> 14:40.583
-Holy shit, I did it.
-Yes.

14:42.208 --> 14:43.458
That was crazy.

14:44.541 --> 14:45.750
Hey, not bad, kid.

14:45.833 --> 14:50.250
Not bad. All right.
Best shot you ever took?

14:51.500 --> 14:54.500
-Uh, the one I didn't take.
-What does that mean?

14:55.708 --> 15:00.041
Uh, it means... Never mind,
shouldn't have said it.

15:00.125 --> 15:02.583
-Oh, come on, you can't do that.
-Never mind, it's nothin'.

15:02.666 --> 15:04.708
What? Come on,
consider it my Christmas present.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.500
-No, it's not the right time.
-Yes.

15:06.583 --> 15:10.958
-Look, it'll be a good story, I'm sure...
-It's just not a good story, okay?

15:14.583 --> 15:15.708
It's...

15:18.708 --> 15:20.625
about the time I met someone.

15:23.833 --> 15:25.416
I was sent to take her out.

15:28.208 --> 15:30.833
And when I got there, when it was time...

15:32.541 --> 15:33.666
Um...

15:34.875 --> 15:35.916
I couldn't do it.

15:40.125 --> 15:43.125
I just had this feeling
that she wanted out.

15:45.916 --> 15:47.250
Turns out, I was right.

15:49.041 --> 15:50.208
KATE: You mean Natasha.

15:51.250 --> 15:52.250
Yeah.

15:57.750 --> 15:58.958
She was the best there was.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
I'm sorry.

16:08.750 --> 16:12.333
It's all right. It's, uh... When you do
what I do for a living, it...

16:14.583 --> 16:18.583
It's just a game
of managing loss, right? So...

16:26.250 --> 16:28.791
Kids, Janie, Janie, Tommy!

16:31.583 --> 16:34.083
Look at you.
Oh, I could eat you up.

16:35.083 --> 16:37.458
-Where's your mother?
-BOY: She went looking for you.

16:37.541 --> 16:39.166
You lost your family in the Blip?

16:41.083 --> 16:43.875
Yeah. Like half the world.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.125
God, that must have been devastating.

16:50.500 --> 16:52.083
Yeah, there are no words.

16:58.291 --> 16:59.791
Is that where you met the Ronin?

17:12.125 --> 17:13.250
It's you, isn't it?

17:16.833 --> 17:18.875
Everybody dealt with the Blip
in their own way.

17:21.791 --> 17:23.958
I continued doing
what I was trained to do.

17:25.291 --> 17:26.458
Protect people.

17:26.625 --> 17:29.500
Hurting people. Investigating first,

17:29.583 --> 17:32.958
but in the end, my job has always been
to hurt people.

17:33.041 --> 17:34.208
You were a hero.

17:34.291 --> 17:35.500
I was a weapon.

17:37.208 --> 17:41.291
I was aimed by the right people
at the right targets, so...

17:41.375 --> 17:44.000
Look, you made mistakes,
but those are behind you.

17:44.083 --> 17:45.208
No, it's tied to me.

17:48.208 --> 17:49.416
Tied to my family.

17:52.791 --> 17:57.708
That's why I'm here.
And I can't go home till I fix it.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.291
I really appreciate what you did tonight.

18:12.083 --> 18:13.083
It means a lot.

18:16.333 --> 18:21.208
You know, you should get some rest.
You got a big day tomorrow.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.041
-Yes, boss. Good night.
-'Night.

18:29.375 --> 18:30.875
Come on!

18:53.625 --> 18:56.708
NATASHA: Killing all these people
isn't gonna bring your family back.

19:05.083 --> 19:06.375
It's okay.

19:06.458 --> 19:07.458
Please.

19:09.041 --> 19:10.041
No!

19:15.166 --> 19:16.958
It's three days until Christmas

19:17.083 --> 19:19.625
and we've got your soundtrack
for the holiday season.

19:19.708 --> 19:23.458
You're listening to New York's
107.6, light FM.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.125
-Morning.
-Mornin'.

19:30.458 --> 19:32.708
-Some coffee.
-Oh, thank God.

19:33.041 --> 19:35.500
Okay, this morning, I'm gonna have a talk
with our friend, Kazi.

19:35.666 --> 19:38.583
What I want you to do
is track down the trick arrows

19:38.666 --> 19:39.916
from our friends, the LARPers.

19:41.125 --> 19:43.958
-Wait, what?
-My tracer arrow stopped moving,

19:44.041 --> 19:46.458
and it's over by an NYPD facility
down by the bridge.

19:46.541 --> 19:49.416
And now the LARPers, they're mostly
first responders, one's a cop.

19:49.500 --> 19:52.041
See if they can get access
to that NYPD facility.

19:52.166 --> 19:53.166
LARPer friends.

19:53.250 --> 19:56.125
Yeah, they're... They're colorful.
You're gonna love 'em.

19:56.291 --> 19:59.958
You know, I like to think of them
more as our arrows.

20:00.625 --> 20:02.375
Okay. Go get our arrows.

20:02.458 --> 20:03.583
Hmm.

20:07.541 --> 20:08.541
WOMAN: Thrust!

20:08.625 --> 20:10.500
MAN: Lightning Bolt!
One, two, three, four, five.

20:10.583 --> 20:15.666
WOMAN: Retreat! Formation. Stab!

20:17.333 --> 20:18.625
Ice Wall!

20:21.541 --> 20:22.875
Superpower Doom!

20:24.333 --> 20:27.791
Hey, I, uh... I don't mean to interrupt...

20:29.541 --> 20:31.291
-Wow. You guys are...
-WOMAN: Retreat!

20:31.875 --> 20:32.958
Dedicated.

20:33.041 --> 20:34.041
Who are you?

20:34.833 --> 20:37.666
Uh, Hawkeye sent me here
on official Avengers business.

20:37.750 --> 20:39.916
I'm his partner-slash-best-friend, Kate.

20:40.458 --> 20:42.750
He said you guys could help us out.
One of you is a cop?

20:42.875 --> 20:46.791
That's me, Officer Wendy Conrad.
Better as Els-Bath of Deepdale.

20:47.916 --> 20:51.333
Officer. Basically, all we need is some

20:51.416 --> 20:53.416
casual, run-of-the-mill
evidence tampering.

20:53.666 --> 20:57.166
Hawkeye's trick arrows are in an NYPD
facility near the Manhattan Bridge.

20:59.166 --> 21:00.916
I can probably help you out

21:01.041 --> 21:03.000
if you make it worth my while.

21:03.625 --> 21:05.500
Worth our while.

21:07.416 --> 21:12.041
Yeah. Yeah, sure, totally.
Whatever you want. All right.

21:12.916 --> 21:14.625
All in? Okay. This is gonna be great.

21:14.708 --> 21:18.375
You guys are awesome, outfits, the...
It's just really awesome.

21:37.791 --> 21:40.500
Surprise. Ah, ah. Just wanna talk.

21:42.625 --> 21:44.250
I need to get out of the city.

21:44.333 --> 21:47.416
But before I go, I need to put
this Ronin situation to bed.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.458
Look, I know you have Maya's ear,

21:49.666 --> 21:53.166
and you seem like you're a reasonably
not stupid guy.

21:53.291 --> 21:56.750
If you're tryin' to flatter me,
you are way off the mark.

21:56.833 --> 21:58.750
Don't get me wrong,
I think you're a doormat.

21:59.875 --> 22:01.166
Look, you've been working under

22:01.250 --> 22:04.000
William Lopez as a lieutenant for,
what, for four years?

22:05.000 --> 22:07.083
And now under Maya for a few more years.

22:08.708 --> 22:10.583
You know this operation
better than anybody.

22:11.958 --> 22:14.166
You know what Maya's boss wants.

22:14.958 --> 22:17.208
And you know what he's already done
to get it.

22:19.333 --> 22:20.458
So what do you know?

22:20.541 --> 22:22.958
I know he doesn't like
this attention, that's for sure.

22:24.125 --> 22:30.416
I know Maya's obsession,
wanting to hunt Ronin down, is dangerous.

22:31.416 --> 22:33.333
Clouds her judgment, don't you think?

22:33.791 --> 22:38.583
So you're concerned for the organization?
And, uh... And my rank in it?

22:40.416 --> 22:41.416
What do you want?

22:42.583 --> 22:44.000
I don't want anybody else to die.

22:46.750 --> 22:49.458
But Maya's need for vengeance
is gonna get her killed.

22:50.875 --> 22:51.916
Period.

22:55.541 --> 22:59.458
Looking for this? Or maybe
it's the box cutter under the seat.

22:59.625 --> 23:00.791
Look, are we done here?

23:02.250 --> 23:03.500
She's chasing a ghost.

23:05.750 --> 23:09.166
I think you know that.
But I can't convince her of that.

23:10.250 --> 23:12.500
And I'm guessing
you're the only one who can.

23:14.083 --> 23:17.875
This is the final warning.
Just get it done.

23:19.916 --> 23:21.541
Hey, can I have my gun back?

23:21.916 --> 23:23.333
Yeah, what do you think?

23:28.166 --> 23:29.500
Ah, come on.

23:39.958 --> 23:41.625
-There's our guy.
-Hey.

23:41.708 --> 23:43.666
Snickerdoodle? They're still warm.

23:43.750 --> 23:45.583
-Okay.
-Hey, come on in.

23:45.666 --> 23:48.375
-Hey, Clint. How'd your day go?
-Hi.

23:48.541 --> 23:52.458
My, uh...
My day's been fine. How are you doing?

23:52.541 --> 23:55.166
Great, yeah. Better than yours, I'd say.

23:56.708 --> 23:59.583
So did you, uh, get my gear?

23:59.666 --> 24:01.250
Yeah, yeah. They're on the way.

24:01.333 --> 24:03.666
They should be here any minute.
Yeah, relax.

24:04.208 --> 24:05.458
-What?
-Check that out.

24:07.541 --> 24:09.750
Not gonna lie,
I look pretty good as a Viking.

24:09.875 --> 24:13.375
-I... You know, I made this myself.
-No way!

24:13.458 --> 24:16.250
-By hand.
-Could I hire you to make my next one?

24:16.333 --> 24:18.375
Oh, yeah. I would love to.

24:18.458 --> 24:21.833
Hey, wait a second.
What if that's our deal?

24:21.916 --> 24:25.333
-What deal?
-We get you the arrows and info,

24:25.416 --> 24:27.916
and you get us materials
for a new costume.

24:28.000 --> 24:33.666
Okay, how about enough materials to make
your costumes plus two more?

24:35.250 --> 24:37.708
I know a certain someone
who needs a little help with theirs.

24:39.208 --> 24:40.416
-I'm in.
-Great!

24:40.583 --> 24:43.458
Hey, Orval, you hear that?
We gettin' new costumes.

24:43.958 --> 24:48.125
Uh, Kate, I asked you to simply
retrieve my arrows, not stage a play.

24:48.250 --> 24:49.791
Uh, we're a... We're a guild.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.166
Okay. I gotta go.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.125
We gotta go.
We're in this together, right?

25:02.208 --> 25:04.000
-Excuse me, sorry.
-You're gonna have to change.

25:04.083 --> 25:05.125
-Hawkeye.
-Oh, hi.

25:05.416 --> 25:07.125
Arrow Retrieval Mission complete.

25:07.458 --> 25:09.583
Oh, yes. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.

25:09.666 --> 25:10.750
This is my bag.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.833
-Okay.
-You didn't bring your own bag?

25:15.791 --> 25:16.916
No, I mean...

25:17.000 --> 25:20.750
My wife gave me this bag.
It's embroidered. It says "Bombshell."

25:20.916 --> 25:23.458
I... I can see that,
that it's very important to you.

25:23.541 --> 25:25.958
He'll get it back to you.
Yeah, I'll make sure of it.

25:26.708 --> 25:27.916
-Right?
-I promise.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.041
-Let's go.
-Right. Okay.

25:29.125 --> 25:30.375
-Thank you. See ya.
-Okay then.

25:30.458 --> 25:32.041
-Thank you so much.
-Beautiful bag.

25:32.125 --> 25:33.125
Thank you.

25:42.416 --> 25:44.125
KATE: You wanna tell me
what we're doing here?

25:44.625 --> 25:47.625
BARTON: Something very important to me
is pinging inside that apartment.

25:47.708 --> 25:50.583
It was stolen from a black market
auction. I need it back.

25:51.208 --> 25:53.666
No lights, no movement.

25:55.791 --> 25:56.875
This is our chance.

25:57.583 --> 26:00.041
This would have been easier
if we were on a higher rooftop.

26:00.166 --> 26:01.166
That's what you think.

26:02.208 --> 26:04.458
Yeah, exactly. That's why I said it.

26:04.541 --> 26:08.125
Kate, you always wanna prioritize
a quick exit over a quick entrance

26:08.291 --> 26:10.958
so when things go sideways,
and they usually do,

26:11.708 --> 26:12.875
you have an exit strategy.

26:12.958 --> 26:14.750
That's why I chose this spot.

26:14.833 --> 26:17.041
It's got good sightlines for all my exits.

26:17.708 --> 26:18.958
Entry should be easy.

26:19.041 --> 26:22.083
Think it should take me
about three and a half minutes to get in.

26:22.166 --> 26:25.833
So, if you see anything out here,
just give me a signal, Kate. All right?

26:28.416 --> 26:29.416
Kate?

26:31.875 --> 26:33.625
-MAN: What're you doin?

26:36.125 --> 26:37.750
Kate? Kate?

26:37.833 --> 26:40.500
-There you are.
-I told you you're supposed to be lookout.

26:40.583 --> 26:43.833
Yeah, but of the two of us, who do you
trust up there not to get distracted?

26:43.916 --> 26:45.750
That's not fair, that your inability

26:45.833 --> 26:48.916
to act like a grown-up
helps you get your way.

26:49.166 --> 26:52.333
No, it's not.
But it is what it is.

26:53.458 --> 26:56.375
I need you to use your grappling hook
arrow to anchor yourself in.

26:56.458 --> 26:58.625
Propel down the side
of the building to the window.

26:58.708 --> 27:01.416
If it's locked, break in quietly.

27:01.500 --> 27:04.875
Yeah, love all of that. Great plan,
just a slight tweak though.

27:04.958 --> 27:07.541
Good evening, sir.
Can I help you with your bags?

27:07.625 --> 27:08.958
-Oh. Thank you.
- Sure.

27:09.041 --> 27:10.875
What are you... No, no, no.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.166
BARTON: No, no, no.
Don't... Don't engage.

27:13.250 --> 27:15.583
-Got celery, a little Kashi.
-BARTON: Kate.

27:15.666 --> 27:16.875
Okay, some pretzels?

27:17.958 --> 27:19.000
Where are you?

27:19.083 --> 27:20.958
-Oh, relax. I'm taking the elevator.

27:21.458 --> 27:22.708
I'm sorry, what was that?

27:24.458 --> 27:27.333
Oh, I, uh... I'm sorry,
I wasn't talking to you.

27:30.875 --> 27:32.208
Can I tell you a secret?

27:32.666 --> 27:33.791
BARTON: Please don't do this.

27:33.875 --> 27:35.875
I was talking to an Avenger.

27:36.875 --> 27:37.916
He's in my ear.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.541
BARTON: Maybe you should stop talking.

27:39.833 --> 27:41.333
Yeah, I'm his partner.

27:41.416 --> 27:42.916
I'll just take this back.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.166
I can help you to the door, no problem.

27:45.250 --> 27:47.708
No, that's all right. I got it from here.

27:47.791 --> 27:50.125
Okay, are you sure?
It's really no problem.

27:51.375 --> 27:52.791
All right, you take care now.

27:52.916 --> 27:54.041
-

27:54.125 --> 27:57.000
What do you do
with this giant bow problem?

27:57.083 --> 27:58.416
I have a collapsible one.

27:58.500 --> 28:00.250
Oh, that makes sense.

28:02.375 --> 28:05.250
Okay. I'm at the door.

28:06.250 --> 28:07.250
We're good.

28:32.125 --> 28:35.500
Okay. Living room's all clear.

28:37.250 --> 28:38.416
Oh, shit.

28:42.750 --> 28:43.791
What was that?

28:44.750 --> 28:47.375
I don't know. There are, like,
strobe lights attached to the wall.

28:47.500 --> 28:50.083
-BARTON: What do you mean, strobe lights?
-I don't know.

28:51.375 --> 28:52.666
Yeah, what do you see?

28:53.333 --> 28:55.250
Okay, what am I lookin' for?

28:55.958 --> 28:58.625
A watch, vintage Rolex.

28:59.625 --> 29:01.375
Belongs to someone I used to work with.

29:01.916 --> 29:03.458
Is that the whole story, Clint?

29:03.541 --> 29:05.416
BARTON: They've been out of the game
a long time,

29:05.500 --> 29:07.833
but their identity is still attached
to that watch.

29:07.916 --> 29:10.250
Hmm. And if the Tracksuits
find out about it?

29:12.000 --> 29:14.125
It would blow their cover.
Goodbye, friend.

29:22.250 --> 29:23.375
Got the watch.

29:25.041 --> 29:26.041
Great.

29:29.916 --> 29:31.166
Hang on a minute.

29:33.375 --> 29:35.750
Clint, somebody is taking notes
on your family.

29:35.833 --> 29:36.875
BARTON: What?

29:36.958 --> 29:39.416
"Clint Barton, wife, Laura,
daughter, Lila, age 14,

29:39.500 --> 29:42.333
"son, Cooper, age 16, son, Nate." What...

29:42.416 --> 29:44.291
Kate, get out of there now.

29:44.375 --> 29:46.083
What? Why?

29:46.166 --> 29:49.541
That light's an alarm. It's a silent alarm
for people that can't hear.

29:49.625 --> 29:50.791
Oh, my God.

29:50.875 --> 29:51.958
It's Maya's apartment.

29:52.041 --> 29:53.416
BARTON: All right, I'm coming...

29:55.041 --> 29:56.625
Clint, what's going on?

29:57.833 --> 29:58.916
Clint?

30:04.708 --> 30:05.708
Maya's here.

30:05.791 --> 30:06.875
BARTON: Yeah, I can see that.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.416
Then why didn't you tell me?

30:10.166 --> 30:12.458
BARTON: I did. Maya's on the roof with me.

30:12.833 --> 30:14.833
-No, Maya is definitely here.
-

30:18.958 --> 30:20.750
Well, who the hell am I fighting then?

30:23.791 --> 30:25.500
A little help?

30:27.041 --> 30:30.666
Give me a second. Incoming.

30:34.041 --> 30:35.083
Get on the zip line.

30:55.916 --> 30:57.166
-

30:57.250 --> 30:59.125
Come on. Come on.

31:07.666 --> 31:09.333
That hurt.

31:49.250 --> 31:52.208
No, no, no! No, no!

32:04.583 --> 32:05.583
Pull me up!

32:09.583 --> 32:10.583
Get outta here.

33:07.791 --> 33:09.208
-

33:31.333 --> 33:33.541
Who the hell was that?

33:34.583 --> 33:36.000
You don't wanna know, Kate.

33:36.083 --> 33:39.166
I cannot be your partner
if you don't tell me what's going on.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.333
You're not my partner.
Do you understand that?

33:42.416 --> 33:43.416
You never were.

33:45.291 --> 33:48.250
Someone has hired a Black Widow assassin.

33:49.958 --> 33:52.750
This has gotten very real, very quickly.

33:54.041 --> 33:55.458
So I'm doing this alone.

33:57.583 --> 33:58.583
No, you're not.

34:00.875 --> 34:04.000
Look, I know that tonight didn't go
as planned, but I chose to be here.

34:04.083 --> 34:06.916
I understand the risk,
I understand all of that.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.291
I'm not gonna do it.

34:09.083 --> 34:10.083
Do you hear me?

34:12.500 --> 34:13.500
Do you hear me?

34:17.958 --> 34:19.458
Go home, Kate.

34:20.666 --> 34:21.958
It's over.
