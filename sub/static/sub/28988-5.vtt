00:08.791 --> 00:11.359
- Is that when you get off?
Delilah's has a killer whiskey.

00:11.402 --> 00:13.100
- Uh, thanks, I'm flattered,
but I--

00:13.143 --> 00:14.492
- You're seeing someone.
I get it.

00:14.536 --> 00:16.929
- All I could think about
was the married man

00:16.973 --> 00:18.322
that I am having
an affair with.

00:18.366 --> 00:20.324
I am so much better
than this, Bobby.

00:20.368 --> 00:21.804
- Keri, Stephanie
had a relapse.

00:21.847 --> 00:24.459
- I have a problem with
boundaries, so I'll shut up.

00:24.502 --> 00:25.895
- Are you for real?

00:25.938 --> 00:28.158
Don't ever stop
speaking your mind.

00:28.202 --> 00:30.682
- Why don't you tell me
how you're gonna take your wife

00:30.726 --> 00:32.336
to a hospital in another state?

00:32.380 --> 00:35.557
Please don't suddenly make me
a priority because I'm sick.

00:35.600 --> 00:38.603
- I'm making you a priority
because you're my wife.

00:38.647 --> 00:40.083
I'm going with you.

00:40.127 --> 00:41.867
- I've arranged for
Nick D'Amato to be my driver.

00:41.911 --> 00:43.347
- Are you out of your mind?

00:43.391 --> 00:44.914
- Jeff, I need
to get close to him.

00:44.957 --> 00:47.047
I need to find out if he's--
- What,

00:47.090 --> 00:48.483
a murderer?

00:48.526 --> 00:50.311
- I didn't mean to put you
on the spot yesterday.

00:50.354 --> 00:52.095
- Don't worry about it.
- Luke.

00:52.139 --> 00:54.793
- Keri.
- Nice to meet you, Keri.

01:02.888 --> 01:06.327
- ♪ I've been waiting
for someone like you ♪

01:06.370 --> 01:08.546
♪ To pull me through
another 24 ♪

01:08.590 --> 01:10.940
- Please tell me
that's not your lunch.

01:10.983 --> 01:12.463
- "Lunch,"
what's that?

01:12.507 --> 01:14.683
- Just so you know,
Polish place on the corner

01:14.726 --> 01:16.728
of Washington is fast and
they have homemade pierogis.

01:16.772 --> 01:18.295
- Oh, that's good to know.

01:18.339 --> 01:20.428
I got a settlement conference
in a half an hour, though.

01:23.779 --> 01:25.824
- City attorney's office.

01:25.868 --> 01:27.087
- Hmm?

01:27.130 --> 01:28.740
- You're the hotshot
who went after U.S. Steel.

01:28.784 --> 01:30.220
I thought you looked familiar.

01:30.264 --> 01:32.048
- There were a lot of us
on that case.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.137
- You're being modest.
What's your name again?

01:34.181 --> 01:36.444
- Keri.
- Hi.

01:36.487 --> 01:37.923
Bobby.

01:37.967 --> 01:39.360
Novak.

01:41.623 --> 01:43.146
- What?

01:43.190 --> 01:45.235
- You can cut the whole
casual run-in, Alderman.

01:45.279 --> 01:47.237
We've been in the elevator
at least ten times.

01:47.281 --> 01:50.066
- We have?
- You know we have.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.937
- So you do know who I am.

01:51.981 --> 01:54.201
- Yes, and I also know
that you're married.

01:54.244 --> 01:56.159
- Not that you asked,

01:56.203 --> 01:58.248
but I'm separated.

01:58.292 --> 01:59.902
- I didn't ask,
and if I had a nickel

01:59.945 --> 02:01.121
for every time I heard that--

02:01.164 --> 02:02.948
- You'd have nearly a dollar.
I get it.

02:02.992 --> 02:04.646
In this case, it's true.

02:04.689 --> 02:06.865
- Says the man who promised
to support the last budget

02:06.909 --> 02:08.432
and then went back on it.

02:08.476 --> 02:10.434
- So you're not only looking
to see if I'm wearing a ring,

02:10.478 --> 02:13.263
you're studying me
at city council meetings?

02:13.307 --> 02:15.570
I'm starting to think
you came here to run into me.

02:15.613 --> 02:17.267
- You know, instead of spending
your lunch hour

02:17.311 --> 02:19.269
charming city employees,
maybe you should be working

02:19.313 --> 02:20.618
for the people
who put you in office.

02:20.662 --> 02:22.272
- You don't know
what I do all day.

02:22.316 --> 02:23.795
- I know what I see,

02:23.839 --> 02:26.798
and your good looks
are only gonna get you so far.

02:36.112 --> 02:38.636
- I hope you don't mind.
- No, no, it's fine.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.421
Um...

02:42.205 --> 02:43.337
Listen, I don't mean
to be rude,

02:43.380 --> 02:44.990
but, uh, you gotta go.

02:45.034 --> 02:46.296
- Oh, shit.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.429
Love 'em and leave 'em.
- No, it's not that.

02:48.472 --> 02:50.300
I--I have an early meeting.

02:50.344 --> 02:52.563
- Don't worry,
I totally get it.

02:52.607 --> 02:54.739
Hey, if you want,

02:54.783 --> 02:57.786
I was thinking maybe we can
go away this weekend.

03:00.658 --> 03:02.617
Kidding.

03:04.271 --> 03:06.708
Your face, though.
Wow.

03:06.751 --> 03:09.841
Um, seriously,
though, call you?

03:09.885 --> 03:11.103
- Yeah, yeah,
definitely call.

03:11.147 --> 03:13.193
- All right.
- Okay.

03:26.641 --> 03:28.860
- Are you Keri Allen?
- Yeah.

03:28.904 --> 03:30.862
- This is for you.

03:41.743 --> 03:43.701
- Fuck.

03:47.618 --> 03:49.098
- There you are.

03:49.141 --> 03:50.795
I thought maybe you changed
your mind about our deal.

03:50.839 --> 03:52.144
- Sorry.
I asked him.

03:52.188 --> 03:53.798
- He's a bear
without his coffee and doughnut

03:53.842 --> 03:54.799
first thing back.

03:54.843 --> 03:56.497
- Well, I'll forgive you
this time

03:56.540 --> 03:57.889
as long as I get
a cruller out of it.

03:57.933 --> 04:00.240
And welcome back, by the way.
How was your trip?

04:00.283 --> 04:02.154
- I'd like you
to start digging in

04:02.198 --> 04:04.069
to some longer-term projects
for me.

04:04.113 --> 04:07.290
- Technology, manufacturing,

04:07.334 --> 04:10.075
Ickaris' second headquarters.

04:10.119 --> 04:11.642
You sure you want
that headache?

04:11.686 --> 04:13.731
- If that headache comes with
1/2 billion in construction,

04:13.775 --> 04:14.645
I'll take it.

04:14.689 --> 04:15.864
- What I should have asked is,

04:15.907 --> 04:17.605
do you need
another headache right now?

04:17.648 --> 04:21.261
- Is there something you want
to say, Ms. Pearson?

04:21.304 --> 04:23.698
- I know why
you were out of town.

04:23.741 --> 04:26.266
And if there's anything
I can do to help--

04:26.309 --> 04:27.658
- I just told you
what you can do to help.

04:27.702 --> 04:29.834
- I know, but if you want
someone to talk to,

04:29.878 --> 04:31.445
I understand
what you're going through.

04:31.488 --> 04:32.707
- I doubt that's true.

04:32.750 --> 04:35.318
Just get the ball rolling
on those, please.

04:43.805 --> 04:45.328
- Keri.

04:45.372 --> 04:47.330
If I knew you were waiting, I'd
have brought you a doughnut.

04:48.766 --> 04:51.029
- I need a favor.
- What kind of favor, Keri?

04:51.073 --> 04:53.293
- It's a wrongful termination
suit against the city.

04:53.336 --> 04:55.425
- Okay, but isn't that
what you do,

04:55.469 --> 04:57.209
defend the city
against lawsuits?

04:57.253 --> 04:58.646
- Normally, yes,
but the man suing

04:58.689 --> 05:01.431
is my former boss,
and I'm a named defendant.

05:01.475 --> 05:03.346
- I don't mind
helping you, Keri,

05:03.390 --> 05:06.088
but the mayor has already
given me my marching orders,

05:06.131 --> 05:09.526
and, as you are so fond
of reminding me,

05:09.570 --> 05:11.006
I'm no longer a lawyer.

05:11.049 --> 05:12.399
- I don't need a lawyer.

05:12.442 --> 05:14.401
I don't want it litigated.
I want it to go away.

05:14.444 --> 05:15.706
Isn't that what you do?

05:15.750 --> 05:17.752
- In my experience,
when someone wants something

05:17.795 --> 05:21.451
to go away, it tells me
one of two things:

05:21.495 --> 05:23.714
either they're afraid
of the outcome,

05:23.758 --> 05:27.022
or they're afraid
of certain things coming out.

05:27.065 --> 05:28.371
Which one is it?

05:28.415 --> 05:30.155
- Bobby is named
in the suit too,

05:30.199 --> 05:32.157
and I'm trying to protect him.

05:32.201 --> 05:33.724
The last thing he needs
right now

05:33.768 --> 05:35.900
is to become collateral damage
in a courtroom spectacle,

05:35.944 --> 05:37.641
given everything
that's going on with him,

05:37.685 --> 05:41.906
and I hope that you would
feel the same way.

05:41.950 --> 05:43.995
- I'll see what I can do.

05:46.868 --> 05:49.174
- Jessica, this stays
between us.

05:49.218 --> 05:50.828
- Of course.

06:07.236 --> 06:08.672
- City Hall,
this is the mayor's office.

06:08.716 --> 06:10.500
- Yoli?

06:10.544 --> 06:12.372
- Dark roast with a splash
of cream, no sugar?

06:12.415 --> 06:13.851
- I need more than coffee.

06:13.895 --> 06:17.420
I have an assignment for you.
- Ooh, an assignment.

06:17.464 --> 06:18.726
How "Mission Impossible."

06:18.769 --> 06:22.077
- You are aware that Chicago
is on the short list

06:22.120 --> 06:23.513
to be the second headquarters
of Ickaris.

06:23.557 --> 06:24.949
- I might have
heard something.

06:24.993 --> 06:26.603
- The mayor's already done
the dog and pony show,

06:26.647 --> 06:29.650
but I need someone who can
sell them on the city itself,

06:29.693 --> 06:32.174
starting with a bird's-eye view
of Lincoln Yards.

06:32.217 --> 06:34.089
- Who's "them"?
Like, the CEO?

06:34.132 --> 06:35.395
- Blake Everett.

06:35.438 --> 06:37.135
He's one of their VPs
of corporate affairs.

06:37.179 --> 06:41.401
Don't worry, he's 31
and has a phone for an ear.

06:41.444 --> 06:43.446
- Why can't you do it?
- Excuse me?

06:43.490 --> 06:45.143
- No, I mean,
I don't understand

06:45.187 --> 06:46.580
why you're having me do this.

06:46.623 --> 06:47.972
- Because it's mile one
of a marathon,

06:48.016 --> 06:50.018
and I have something pressing
I have to attend to.

06:50.061 --> 06:52.237
Yoli, what's going on?

06:52.281 --> 06:53.325
- Nothing, I just--
- No, no.

06:53.369 --> 06:54.936
You have been chomping
at the bit

06:54.979 --> 06:56.807
for a chance to be in the game,
and I'm giving it to you.

06:56.851 --> 06:59.462
- Well, let's just say I'm not
Ickaris' number one fan.

06:59.506 --> 07:01.464
- Oh, well, let's just say
I pluck someone else out

07:01.508 --> 07:02.900
of Streets and Sanitation
who is.

07:02.944 --> 07:04.815
- Not like I can't
put my personal issues aside

07:04.859 --> 07:07.252
to do this job.
I'm happy to do it.

07:07.296 --> 07:09.385
So...

07:09.429 --> 07:13.171
- Yoli, the file.

07:21.484 --> 07:23.486
- Thank you.
Hi, Keri Allen.

07:23.530 --> 07:26.010
Ms. Riculli has just gone
on maternity leave,

07:26.054 --> 07:28.709
but I'm completely caught up
to speed on your case,

07:28.752 --> 07:32.234
and I think that you'll find
this number more than fair.

07:38.414 --> 07:39.850
- $7,000?

07:39.894 --> 07:41.939
- That won't begin
to pay our bills.

07:41.983 --> 07:43.550
- I'm sorry, that's the number
on the table.

07:43.593 --> 07:44.855
- Well, then you can keep it
on the table.

07:44.899 --> 07:47.075
- Ms. Aquino, I feel for you
and your family,

07:47.118 --> 07:49.381
but passing
between train cars is illegal,

07:49.425 --> 07:50.948
and your son is at fault,
not the city.

07:50.992 --> 07:53.864
- And the city's responsibility
supersedes his violation

07:53.908 --> 07:55.562
if the train
was not maintained.

07:55.605 --> 07:56.998
- That's true.

07:57.041 --> 07:58.434
However, I'm sure that
Ms. Riculli explained to you

07:58.478 --> 07:59.783
that if this went to trial,

07:59.827 --> 08:01.611
Safety and Inspections
would dispute your claim

08:01.655 --> 08:03.091
and you would end up
with nothing.

08:03.134 --> 08:04.527
- I don't believe this.

08:04.571 --> 08:05.746
- If you give me a few days,

08:05.789 --> 08:07.399
I could probably get this up
to $10,000.

08:07.443 --> 08:10.533
- My son is crippled,
Ms. Allen.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.883
He'll never be normal again.

08:12.927 --> 08:15.538
And we've asked
for those inspections.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.061
- I don't understand.

08:17.105 --> 08:19.020
- My office requested
documentation during discovery,

08:19.063 --> 08:21.718
and we got nothing back
from your predecessor.

08:21.762 --> 08:23.415
- Something must have
gotten lost in the shuffle.

08:23.459 --> 08:25.069
That's not--
- Three times?

08:25.113 --> 08:27.463
City Hall must be
quite a mess.

08:29.596 --> 08:30.771
- Still think you made
the right choice

08:30.814 --> 08:32.076
coming here over big law?

08:32.120 --> 08:34.165
Well, I still have my soul.

08:34.209 --> 08:36.559
Yeah, the work is soul-sucking,

08:36.603 --> 08:38.735
but I hear the paychecks
fill some of the void.

08:38.779 --> 08:39.910
- Eh, who needs money

08:39.954 --> 08:41.564
when you have the glamor
of public service?

08:41.608 --> 08:43.523
What can I help you with, Keri?

08:43.566 --> 08:44.785
And don't tell me
you need more cases.

08:44.828 --> 08:46.569
You already do double
anyone else.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.092
- You know how you said
it's our duty

08:48.136 --> 08:49.441
to overturn every rock?

08:49.485 --> 08:51.443
- Oh, someone was listening
in class.

08:51.487 --> 08:52.880
- So I think some
of the evidence

08:52.923 --> 08:55.099
may have gotten lost in
transition on Riculli's case.

08:55.143 --> 08:56.623
- Oh, uh, what evidence?

08:56.666 --> 08:59.451
- The entire case hinges on
annual inspections by the CTA,

08:59.495 --> 09:00.888
but we don't seem
to have a single copy.

09:00.931 --> 09:02.237
- I'm sure it was
an honest mistake.

09:02.280 --> 09:03.891
- I'm sure it was too,
but I would like to go back

09:03.934 --> 09:05.153
through the case files
and double-check.

09:05.196 --> 09:06.720
- Well, all right.
I'll look into it.

09:06.763 --> 09:07.764
You have enough to work on.

09:07.808 --> 09:09.200
- No, I'm happy
to do it myself.

09:09.244 --> 09:11.028
- Look, Keri, the truth is,
to keep things moving,

09:11.072 --> 09:12.900
we rely on
a reciprocal relationship

09:12.943 --> 09:14.684
with the departments
we represent.

09:14.728 --> 09:16.773
So in cases like these,
if they don't give it to us

09:16.817 --> 09:18.296
we figure we don't need it.

09:18.340 --> 09:20.037
Does that make sense?

09:35.226 --> 09:37.011
- Gentlemen.

09:37.054 --> 09:39.840
Jessica Pearson.
Thank you for meeting with me.

09:39.883 --> 09:41.755
- Keri must be getting lazy
in her old age

09:41.798 --> 09:43.670
if she's delegating.

09:43.713 --> 09:46.629
I'm not here as an emissary
of the law department.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.631
I get my orders from the top.
- Good.

09:48.675 --> 09:50.154
I see you've read
the complaint.

09:50.198 --> 09:52.069
- I have, and I've looked at
the surrounding circumstances

09:52.113 --> 09:55.072
regarding your client's
termination, and, to be honest,

09:55.116 --> 09:56.552
I don't see a case.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.293
- If that's what you see,
I'd have my eyes checked.

09:58.336 --> 09:59.903
- My eyes are just fine.

09:59.947 --> 10:01.644
What I do see, Mr. Sharma,

10:01.688 --> 10:03.646
is a man whose career
hasn't recovered

10:03.690 --> 10:05.648
since he left
the city attorney's office.

10:05.692 --> 10:06.736
- That's why he's suing,
Ms. Pearson.

10:06.780 --> 10:08.520
- And that's why
I'm sure we can come

10:08.564 --> 10:09.826
to some kind of understanding.

10:09.870 --> 10:11.785
- You want to pay me
to go away.

10:11.828 --> 10:13.090
- That is what you want,
isn't it?

10:13.134 --> 10:14.701
- Not interested.
- Well, maybe you should be.

10:14.744 --> 10:17.834
If this goes to trial,
the jury will see nothing more

10:17.878 --> 10:21.098
than a bitter employee
who waited five years to sue

10:21.142 --> 10:23.623
because he just got a divorce
and is out of money.

10:23.666 --> 10:25.537
- That's because the jury
you're imagining

10:25.581 --> 10:27.017
isn't aware of all the facts.

10:27.061 --> 10:29.019
- The facts are that
your client cheated victims

10:29.063 --> 10:31.935
out of liability claims
for years.

10:31.979 --> 10:33.763
He's lucky he's still
a member of the bar.

10:33.807 --> 10:35.373
- Who the hell are you
to judge me?

10:35.417 --> 10:37.767
- My actions never hurt anyone,

10:37.811 --> 10:39.116
and I paid the price.

10:39.160 --> 10:40.727
- And so did I, but this
isn't about what I did.

10:40.770 --> 10:42.642
It's about what she did.

10:42.685 --> 10:45.122
- "She"?

10:45.166 --> 10:47.385
I thought you were suing
the city and the current mayor.

10:47.429 --> 10:48.909
- Oh, we are.

10:48.952 --> 10:51.389
But she knows what she did,
and we'll start with her.

10:51.433 --> 10:53.696
- Deposition's on Wednesday.

11:03.010 --> 11:04.533
- Hey.

11:04.576 --> 11:06.100
- I didn't miss the end of
Daylight Savings Time, did I?

11:06.143 --> 11:07.405
- No, why?

11:07.449 --> 11:09.103
- I'm waiting for this
Black Everett guy to show,

11:09.146 --> 11:10.452
and he's still not here.

11:10.495 --> 11:12.149
- You're waiting
for Blake Everett?

11:12.193 --> 11:14.282
I'm waiting for Blake Everett.
- To take him to Lincoln Yards?

11:14.325 --> 11:15.936
- Ah, man.

11:18.112 --> 11:19.853
You know what this is, right?

11:19.896 --> 11:21.724
- Millennials on parade.

11:21.768 --> 11:24.205
- I just find it so ironic
that they're sending us out

11:24.248 --> 11:25.380
to whitewash the city.

11:25.423 --> 11:27.382
- Just smile and nod
and sell them

11:27.425 --> 11:28.905
on our bike shares
and beer gardens.

11:28.949 --> 11:30.167
- Yeah, and pay no attention

11:30.211 --> 11:32.039
to the gentrification
behind the curtain.

11:32.082 --> 11:33.301
- You know what's so funny?

11:33.344 --> 11:34.650
I've been trying
to talk the mayor out of this,

11:34.694 --> 11:36.434
and he sends me
to sell them on it.

11:36.478 --> 11:38.915
- I don't know why.
You're a terrible salesman.

11:42.049 --> 11:43.659
- Uh...

11:43.703 --> 11:45.661
let's do this thing.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.750
- You always wanted
to be a tour guide.

11:47.794 --> 11:50.753
- Oh, she got jokes.

11:50.797 --> 11:51.885
I get it.

11:51.928 --> 11:53.364
- He's deposing me?

11:53.408 --> 11:55.192
That self-important asshole.

11:55.236 --> 11:56.585
- He didn't exactly
win me over either.

11:56.628 --> 11:57.804
- Yeah, he's just trying
to find something

11:57.847 --> 11:59.631
to distract
from his meaningless life.

11:59.675 --> 12:01.416
- Well, he seems to think
you had something to do

12:01.459 --> 12:02.722
with why it's meaningless.

12:02.765 --> 12:04.767
- Damn it, I asked you
to make this go away.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.290
- And I will.

12:06.334 --> 12:09.250
But before I do, I need a
straight answer from you, Keri.

12:09.293 --> 12:12.079
Is there any reason this man
thinks he can invalidate

12:12.122 --> 12:13.689
the circumstances
of his firing?

12:13.733 --> 12:15.735
- No.
- There was demonstrable proof?

12:15.778 --> 12:17.954
It wasn't just
circumstantial evidence?

12:17.998 --> 12:20.609
- Yes, there were clear grounds
for his dismissal.

12:20.652 --> 12:23.351
He had to go.
- Okay, then it's personal.

12:23.394 --> 12:24.874
As long as Sharma
has as it out for you,

12:24.918 --> 12:27.616
you still have to prepare
for the deposition.

12:27.659 --> 12:29.487
- Great. I came to you because
I didn't want to bring in

12:29.531 --> 12:31.620
outside council, and now
I don't have a choice, do I?

12:31.663 --> 12:33.491
- Well, at least let me
help you prepare.

12:33.535 --> 12:35.319
- I don't think so.
- Listen to me, Keri.

12:35.363 --> 12:37.104
I've done
a million depositions.

12:37.147 --> 12:39.019
No one can prepare you
better than me.

12:39.062 --> 12:40.672
You go in there
with outside council

12:40.716 --> 12:43.023
without me exploring
every option,

12:43.066 --> 12:45.765
whatever it is you're trying
to keep from getting out

12:45.808 --> 12:47.027
will get out.

12:47.070 --> 12:48.637
That man has it out for you.

12:48.680 --> 12:51.771
Your instincts were to come
to me for help.

12:51.814 --> 12:54.991
Trust your instincts.
Let me help you.

13:10.702 --> 13:12.704
- I didn't know that chain
to your desk was this long.

13:12.748 --> 13:15.664
- Just needed a change
of scenery.

13:15.707 --> 13:17.492
- At the very place
I recommended.

13:17.535 --> 13:19.015
I won't read too much
into it.

13:19.059 --> 13:20.364
- I'm not here to see you,

13:20.408 --> 13:22.062
if that's what
you're wondering.

13:22.105 --> 13:23.933
- Pierogi?

13:23.977 --> 13:25.892
It's mushroom.

13:33.987 --> 13:35.553
What's wrong?

13:35.597 --> 13:37.338
Nothing.
It's just work stuff.

13:37.381 --> 13:38.556
Doesn't seem like nothing.

13:38.600 --> 13:39.819
- I don't know
that it would be appropriate

13:39.862 --> 13:42.517
given your position.

13:42.560 --> 13:45.172
- That's okay.
You don't have to tell me.

13:45.215 --> 13:46.390
You wanna get something
to go, or--

13:46.434 --> 13:49.611
- The city attorney's
burying evidence.

13:49.654 --> 13:51.221
- That's a hell
of an allegation.

13:51.265 --> 13:53.745
- There was something missing
from a case I'm working on,

13:53.789 --> 13:56.009
so I went back through
all the liability cases

13:56.052 --> 13:57.532
under Sharma's tenure.

13:57.575 --> 13:59.664
Every one of them settled
for way less than expected,

13:59.708 --> 14:02.406
and there's evidence missing
from every single one.

14:02.450 --> 14:04.408
It's a pattern.
I see it. I know it.

14:04.452 --> 14:05.670
- Talk to him about it?

14:05.714 --> 14:07.585
- I did, and he didn't seem
bothered at all,

14:07.629 --> 14:09.239
like it was just
standard operating procedure.

14:09.283 --> 14:12.068
- Jesus.
- This man is my mentor.

14:12.112 --> 14:13.287
He's the best professor I had.

14:13.330 --> 14:14.941
He hired me right out
of law school.

14:14.984 --> 14:16.203
I owe him everything.

14:16.246 --> 14:19.293
- That complicates things,
doesn't it?

14:19.336 --> 14:22.426
- What do I do?

14:22.470 --> 14:25.342
- I thought you didn't
come here to see me.

14:25.386 --> 14:27.040
- Please.

14:30.304 --> 14:31.871
- Look, you can do
what your gut is telling you

14:31.914 --> 14:35.048
and expose him,
but from what I've seen,

14:35.091 --> 14:37.920
whistleblowers
rarely get rewarded.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.922
- Are you saying that to me
as a politician?

14:39.966 --> 14:42.577
- No, I'm saying that
as someone who doesn't want

14:42.620 --> 14:45.145
to see you forced out
of City Hall.

14:51.412 --> 14:53.588
- Mr. Alderman, come here.
Take a look.

14:53.631 --> 14:55.459
- You don't have
to keep bringing me up here.

14:55.503 --> 14:56.721
I get it.

14:56.765 --> 14:58.375
Your building is very big
and impressive.

14:58.419 --> 14:59.942
- I wanted to tell you
this in person,

14:59.986 --> 15:01.465
see your reaction.

15:01.509 --> 15:03.380
We're gonna make you mayor.

15:03.424 --> 15:04.947
- I--I know,
that's the idea.

15:04.991 --> 15:07.907
- No, no, buddy.
It's not an idea.

15:07.950 --> 15:10.257
We're doing it now.

15:10.300 --> 15:11.432
- What are you talking about?

15:11.475 --> 15:14.914
- ADA Mills is dropping out,
poor bastard.

15:14.957 --> 15:17.264
It's something about him
diddling a paralegal

15:17.307 --> 15:18.482
a few years back.

15:18.526 --> 15:19.962
- Christ.

15:20.006 --> 15:22.095
One mistake, your entire
political career is over.

15:22.138 --> 15:24.967
- And someone else's
gets started.

15:25.011 --> 15:26.403
I had a consulting firm

15:26.447 --> 15:27.796
look into your strengths
and weaknesses.

15:27.839 --> 15:30.407
They even drafted up
a platform.

15:30.451 --> 15:33.933
You are for jobs
and against gangs.

15:38.850 --> 15:40.765
- What is this, a joke?
- No, not to me.

15:40.809 --> 15:43.507
I paid 20 grand for this.

15:43.551 --> 15:45.379
- Yeah, well,
then you wasted your money.

15:45.422 --> 15:47.903
- Bobby, what--
what are you talking about?

15:47.947 --> 15:49.383
- Pat, listen to me.

15:49.426 --> 15:50.514
I know we've been talking
about this for a long time

15:50.558 --> 15:53.300
and I agreed
to play the long game

15:53.343 --> 15:54.692
and do your bidding
on city council

15:54.736 --> 15:57.391
but the more I'm inside,

15:57.434 --> 16:00.220
the more this shit
gets to me.

16:00.263 --> 16:03.527
I wanna make a mark.

16:03.571 --> 16:06.574
You are good!

16:06.617 --> 16:08.141
Well, you save that
for the campaign--

16:08.184 --> 16:09.751
- I'm not fucking around.

16:09.794 --> 16:12.014
This city's got a reputation
for a reason,

16:12.058 --> 16:13.494
and I'm sick of it.

16:13.537 --> 16:15.409
If I'm gonna do this thing,

16:15.452 --> 16:18.499
I want to be
a new kind of mayor.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.892
- Did you get that out
of your system?

16:20.936 --> 16:22.633
You ready to come back
to planet Earth now?

16:22.677 --> 16:25.680
No, I've spent a lot
of time and energy

16:25.723 --> 16:28.030
rounding up money
for you, okay?

16:28.074 --> 16:30.076
A lot of rich people
are gonna get behind you

16:30.119 --> 16:31.860
because I asked them to.

16:31.903 --> 16:33.862
You wanna be
a new kind of mayor?

16:33.905 --> 16:37.518
You won't be any kind of mayor
if you don't win.

16:39.085 --> 16:41.696
Trust me, Bobby.

16:41.739 --> 16:43.698
Trust me and go along
for the ride,

16:43.741 --> 16:46.309
and all this can be yours.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.711
- Like the mayor said,
this whole area across there

16:56.754 --> 16:58.408
is open for development.

16:58.452 --> 16:59.888
- It's an amazing space.

16:59.931 --> 17:02.108
- There's the museums,
the waterfront,

17:02.151 --> 17:03.587
Wrigleyville, Boystown.

17:03.631 --> 17:06.503
And you're less than 15 miles
from both airports.

17:06.547 --> 17:07.765
- You guys definitely have

17:07.809 --> 17:10.246
that live-work-play vibe
my workforce wants.

17:10.290 --> 17:12.683
I didn't know "vibe"

17:12.727 --> 17:15.251
was the company's top priority.

17:15.295 --> 17:16.905
- What's that?

17:16.948 --> 17:18.080
- Nothing.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.473
- I think the guy
who created a start-up

17:19.516 --> 17:21.475
valued at $100 million
knows what he's doing.

17:21.518 --> 17:23.738
- Oh, no, I--I'm sure he does.

17:23.781 --> 17:26.349
It's just, you know,
spending a fortune

17:26.393 --> 17:29.048
on a corporate playground,
it just, uh--

17:29.091 --> 17:30.919
when you have warehouse workers
on food stamps,

17:30.962 --> 17:32.834
kind of seems like
a backwards strategy.

17:32.877 --> 17:34.792
- You'll have to excuse
Ms. Castillo.

17:34.836 --> 17:37.360
She's our resident contrarian.
- That's okay.

17:37.404 --> 17:40.102
She's not the first person
to say it.

17:40.146 --> 17:41.364
But you are the first

17:41.408 --> 17:43.105
from an administration
vying for our business.

17:43.149 --> 17:44.976
- I'm not trying
to call you out or anything.

17:45.020 --> 17:46.978
I'm just looking out
for Chicago's best interests.

17:47.022 --> 17:48.371
- By calling me out.
- Yoli--

17:48.415 --> 17:49.764
- There's no problem here.

17:49.807 --> 17:51.244
You're vetting a dozen cities,

17:51.287 --> 17:53.115
so you would understand
why we want to do the same.

17:53.159 --> 17:57.119
- Hey, how about we go
check out that vegan place

17:57.163 --> 17:58.512
in the Arts District?

17:58.555 --> 18:00.644
- Sounds great.

18:02.342 --> 18:03.430
- Fucking kidding me?

18:03.473 --> 18:04.779
You can't talk
to that guy like that.

18:04.822 --> 18:06.607
- You told me to speak my mind.
- What?

18:06.650 --> 18:08.348
- Yeah, the other day.

18:08.391 --> 18:10.785
And weren't you speaking yours
before this asshole showed up?

18:10.828 --> 18:13.179
- That was my personal opinion.
I don't make policy decisions.

18:13.222 --> 18:14.832
My job is to help the mayor.

18:14.876 --> 18:16.051
- The mayor lets them build
IckarisWorld here,

18:16.095 --> 18:17.792
you're gonna have a lot
of angry voters.

18:17.835 --> 18:19.620
- He'll have 4,000 people
thanking him for a job.

18:19.663 --> 18:21.187
That's what he's gonna have.

18:21.230 --> 18:23.145
Or was.

18:23.189 --> 18:25.191
Fuck!

18:37.203 --> 18:38.204
- Hey.

18:38.247 --> 18:40.945
Haven't seen you
since you got back.

18:43.339 --> 18:45.080
- I had a lot to catch up on.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.126
- Yeah, I'm sure you got
the headlines from Derrick.

18:47.169 --> 18:48.997
We had quite a day ourselves
with Lloyd.

18:49.040 --> 18:51.260
- Derrick's very good
at his job.

18:51.304 --> 18:53.610
Headlines conveyed the story.

18:53.654 --> 18:54.785
Is that all?

18:54.829 --> 18:57.136
Something else
you want to talk about?

18:58.049 --> 18:59.442
- How is she?
- Why do you ask?

18:59.486 --> 19:01.314
- What do you mean,
"Why do I ask"?

19:01.357 --> 19:02.967
Because I care.

19:03.011 --> 19:04.317
- I don't want
to talk about it.

19:04.360 --> 19:05.535
- Bobby, I'm just trying--

19:05.579 --> 19:06.841
- I don't want
to talk about it with you

19:06.884 --> 19:09.060
or Jessica
or anyone else.

19:09.104 --> 19:10.366
- Ah, that's why.

19:10.410 --> 19:12.194
You're pissed
'cause I told Jessica.

19:12.238 --> 19:14.196
- It wasn't your business.
- You know what?

19:14.240 --> 19:15.850
I had to tell her 'cause you're
the one that brought her in.

19:15.893 --> 19:17.025
- You know how Stephanie
feels about it.

19:17.068 --> 19:18.853
- She can't work
five feet from you

19:18.896 --> 19:19.941
and not know what's going on.

19:19.984 --> 19:21.203
- What do you want
to know, Keri?

19:21.247 --> 19:23.074
You wanna know
what the doctor said?

19:23.118 --> 19:24.946
You wanna know
what the scans showed?

19:24.989 --> 19:27.209
Nothing, okay?
No one knows.

19:27.253 --> 19:31.344
Two days, a battery of tests,
thousands of dollars, for what?

19:31.387 --> 19:33.389
All I want is answers,

19:33.433 --> 19:34.869
and no one has the balls
to tell me

19:34.912 --> 19:37.437
that five years from now,
I'm out of this office

19:37.480 --> 19:39.787
and my wife is in a wheelchair.

19:41.571 --> 19:42.920
That what you wanted to know?

19:42.964 --> 19:46.359
'Cause that's my life.

19:46.402 --> 19:49.057
You wanna be a part of that?

20:06.683 --> 20:08.250
- You waiting on me
or the mayor?

20:08.294 --> 20:09.686
- I don't clock out
until you do.

20:09.730 --> 20:11.035
That was the deal.

20:11.079 --> 20:12.907
- Well, after this morning,
I wasn't so sure.

20:12.950 --> 20:14.822
You were quiet.

20:14.865 --> 20:16.345
- Just doing my job.

20:16.389 --> 20:20.262
- And you've been doing it
very quietly for a while now.

20:20.306 --> 20:22.743
- Since you questioned
whether or not I was involved

20:22.786 --> 20:24.005
in a murder or not, you mean?

20:24.048 --> 20:25.354
- No, since I determined

20:25.398 --> 20:27.878
you absolutely had nothing
to do with one.

20:27.922 --> 20:30.838
I'm sorry I doubted you.
- That's fine.

20:30.881 --> 20:32.970
But the fact
that you suspected me,

20:33.014 --> 20:34.798
that says plenty about
what you think of me.

20:34.842 --> 20:36.104
- I don't know what to think
of you, Nick.

20:36.147 --> 20:37.932
But this arrangement
isn't going to work

20:37.975 --> 20:41.283
unless you trust me enough
to let your walls down.

20:41.327 --> 20:42.937
- Don't you ever get bored
of the view

20:42.980 --> 20:44.112
down that one-way street?

20:44.155 --> 20:45.766
- What are you talking about?

20:45.809 --> 20:47.115
- You expect everyone
to open up for you

20:47.158 --> 20:48.290
but you don't give a thing
in return.

20:48.334 --> 20:50.423
- I stood there
at that press conference

20:50.466 --> 20:52.686
and not only did I answer
every question,

20:52.729 --> 20:54.688
I handed out my number
for follow-ups.

20:54.731 --> 20:56.646
- You didn't give them a thing
you can't find on page one

20:56.690 --> 20:57.908
of an internet search.

20:57.952 --> 20:59.345
- Well, what do you think
I'm hiding?

20:59.388 --> 21:00.737
- Hell, for all I know,
you're some Stepford wife

21:00.781 --> 21:02.609
programmed to write checks
and issue sound bites.

21:02.652 --> 21:04.480
But whatever you are,
what the hell do you know

21:04.524 --> 21:05.786
about what the mayor's
going through?

21:05.829 --> 21:06.917
- You don't know
anything about me.

21:06.961 --> 21:08.484
- Exactly.

21:08.528 --> 21:11.008
I don't know anything.

21:18.842 --> 21:20.279
- So you guys own
this place too?

21:20.322 --> 21:22.977
- You don't grow like we do
without taking some chances.

21:23.020 --> 21:24.021
So, Derrick, what's up?

21:24.065 --> 21:25.458
I got a late flight
to Atlanta.

21:25.501 --> 21:27.634
The mayor wants
to take me to the zoo

21:27.677 --> 21:28.809
and show me the pandas.

21:28.852 --> 21:29.984
- About that.

21:30.027 --> 21:31.551
I'm sorry
at how that went down.

21:31.594 --> 21:34.641
She does not represent the
views of this administration.

21:34.684 --> 21:36.338
- But she is a part of it,

21:36.382 --> 21:39.689
and we do have 18 other cities
dying to make a deal.

21:39.733 --> 21:42.126
- I know, and they're
rolling out the red carpet.

21:42.170 --> 21:43.606
And they should.

21:43.650 --> 21:46.217
But you know she's not the
only one saying those things.

21:46.261 --> 21:47.349
- Is that your pitch?

21:47.393 --> 21:49.308
"You guys suck.
Everybody knows it."

21:49.351 --> 21:52.354
- My pitch is, "We can change
the way the world sees you."

21:52.398 --> 21:55.705
- The world sees us on
the "Forbes 100" and climbing.

21:55.749 --> 21:56.967
- For now,
but look what happened

21:57.011 --> 21:58.447
to Facebook and BP.

21:58.491 --> 22:00.406
They were riding high,
until they weren't.

22:00.449 --> 22:02.364
- We don't have a public
relations problem, Derrick.

22:02.408 --> 22:07.021
- Right now, maybe not.
But you will, and you know it.

22:07.064 --> 22:08.414
- So what do you got?

22:08.457 --> 22:10.329
- The mayor has a group
of grassroots organizations

22:10.372 --> 22:12.679
that will partner with Ickaris
to make this deal work for you

22:12.722 --> 22:14.115
and for the people of Chicago.

22:14.158 --> 22:15.595
- I know what a corporate
accountability team is.

22:15.638 --> 22:17.118
- Then you know it can work.

22:17.161 --> 22:18.554
- It still seems like
you guys are getting

22:18.598 --> 22:19.903
most of the benefits here.

22:19.947 --> 22:22.471
- This is good for your brand,
and you know it.

22:24.081 --> 22:25.605
- Tell you what.

22:25.648 --> 22:28.390
You increase the tax cuts on
every concession that we make

22:28.434 --> 22:31.350
to the community, and we might
have something here.

22:31.393 --> 22:32.742
- If I get the mayor
to sign off on that,

22:32.786 --> 22:35.963
you'll go public
we're top three?

22:36.006 --> 22:38.705
- Yeah, you give the word,
I'll release it.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.143
- Please state your full name
for the record.

22:42.186 --> 22:43.405
- Keri Katherine Allen.

22:43.449 --> 22:44.885
- You are aware
that you're being deposed

22:44.928 --> 22:47.409
in the case of Ken Sharma
versus the city of Chicago?

22:47.453 --> 22:48.889
- I am.

22:48.932 --> 22:50.194
- Will you please establish
a timeline

22:50.238 --> 22:52.022
for your history at City Hall?

22:52.066 --> 22:55.417
- I was deputy city attorney
in 2013

22:55.461 --> 22:57.767
until the incoming
administration

22:57.811 --> 23:00.422
appointed me city attorney
in 2015.

23:00.466 --> 23:02.381
- And what was your
relationship to Ken Sharma?

23:02.424 --> 23:04.078
- It was
a working relationship.

23:04.121 --> 23:05.253
We met in law school.

23:05.296 --> 23:06.863
He was a mentor to me
for two years

23:06.907 --> 23:08.430
until he was appointed
city attorney,

23:08.474 --> 23:11.128
and then he hired me
right after graduation,

23:11.172 --> 23:13.740
and I worked for him
until his departure.

23:13.783 --> 23:15.916
- And how long was that?
- A little under a year.

23:15.959 --> 23:17.918
- And how did it end?
- Poorly.

23:17.961 --> 23:21.269
- Why is Mayor Novak
named in the suit?

23:21.312 --> 23:23.706
- That's a question
for the person filing.

23:23.750 --> 23:25.926
- Take a wild guess.

23:25.969 --> 23:28.755
- The mayor was the one
who outed Ken Sharma

23:28.798 --> 23:30.278
for mishandling evidence.

23:30.321 --> 23:32.106
- How did he get a hold
of the information to do that?

23:32.149 --> 23:33.586
- I gave it to him.

23:33.629 --> 23:35.326
- And how long had you known
the alderman at that time?

23:35.370 --> 23:36.327
- I don't see
how that's relevant.

23:36.371 --> 23:38.591
- How long, Ms. Allen?

23:38.634 --> 23:40.114
- Uh, about a week.

23:40.157 --> 23:42.246
- So you trusted a man
you barely knew a week

23:42.290 --> 23:44.335
with information that could
cost you your job.

23:44.379 --> 23:45.772
- I was trying
to do the right thing.

23:45.815 --> 23:48.470
- And the mayor repaid you
for that information

23:48.514 --> 23:50.254
by making you
the youngest city attorney

23:50.298 --> 23:51.517
in the history of Chicago.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.736
Is that what you mean
by "the right thing"?

23:53.780 --> 23:55.782
- That is not why
I gave him the information.

23:55.825 --> 23:58.437
- Then why did you do it?
- I just told you, I was--

23:58.480 --> 24:01.048
- Well, if it wasn't a
quid pro quo, then what was it?

24:01.091 --> 24:02.876
- Okay, stop it.
- What was it, Ms. Allen?

24:02.919 --> 24:04.486
Because what it
looks like is,

24:04.530 --> 24:07.184
you exchanged sexual favors
for professional gain.

24:07.228 --> 24:09.491
Is that what it was?

24:20.676 --> 24:22.156
- Tell me if I'm crazy.

24:22.199 --> 24:23.462
- You're crazy.
- I'm serious.

24:23.505 --> 24:24.767
I really can't let him
do what he's doing.

24:24.811 --> 24:26.682
I have to say something.
- Okay, take a breath.

24:26.726 --> 24:28.902
- I'm just--I'm gonna go
to the inspector general.

24:28.945 --> 24:30.381
- Wait a second--
- It's systemic.

24:30.425 --> 24:32.296
Sharma knows all about it,
and he's taking kickbacks.

24:32.340 --> 24:34.603
- If you accuse him,
you have to have proof.

24:34.647 --> 24:36.475
- There is a crippled boy,
and they're trying

24:36.518 --> 24:37.998
to cheat him out of money
and justify it

24:38.041 --> 24:39.869
by calling it
prudent management.

24:39.913 --> 24:42.524
I can't let it happen.

24:42.568 --> 24:44.918
- Okay, okay.

24:47.094 --> 24:48.878
You want me
to talk you out of it?

24:48.922 --> 24:50.837
Is that why you came in here?

24:50.880 --> 24:52.316
- I don't think so.

24:52.360 --> 24:55.668
- I just want you to think
before you do anything.

24:57.234 --> 24:58.192
- I have.

24:58.235 --> 25:01.674
- Are you sure
you want to do this?

25:01.717 --> 25:04.198
- I'm sure.

25:06.330 --> 25:09.159
- ♪ I feel like I'm drowning

25:09.203 --> 25:13.207
♪ Oh, drowning

25:13.250 --> 25:16.210
♪ You're holding me down and

25:16.253 --> 25:20.040
♪ Holding me down

25:20.083 --> 25:22.216
♪ You're killing me slow

25:24.000 --> 25:26.873
- ♪ So slow, oh, no

25:26.916 --> 25:29.223
♪ I feel like I'm drowning

25:29.266 --> 25:33.444
♪ I'm drowning

25:46.022 --> 25:48.155
- Hard to leave
when you look like that.

25:49.939 --> 25:53.029
Let me give you
some extra motivation.

25:54.465 --> 25:56.772
- Listen...

25:56.816 --> 25:59.427
your plan to go
to the inspector general,

25:59.470 --> 26:01.472
it could take months
or years, even,

26:01.516 --> 26:02.822
to show any real results.

26:02.865 --> 26:04.563
So what if, in that time,
Sharma gets wind

26:04.606 --> 26:05.607
of what's going on?

26:05.651 --> 26:08.088
Your career's over.

26:10.264 --> 26:11.700
Let me do it.

26:11.744 --> 26:13.441
- How?
- I'm not sure.

26:13.484 --> 26:14.921
I'll figure something out.

26:14.964 --> 26:16.575
- And if it doesn't work,
then your career is over.

26:16.618 --> 26:18.620
- It won't be, trust me.
- It's too risky.

26:18.664 --> 26:20.100
I'm not gonna ask you
to do that for me.

26:20.143 --> 26:22.319
- I'm offering.

26:22.363 --> 26:23.712
It's my way
of saying thank you.

26:23.756 --> 26:25.105
- For sleeping with you?

26:25.148 --> 26:26.367
Why don't you just leave
some cash on the dresser?

26:26.410 --> 26:28.238
- For reminding me
why I went into this work

26:28.282 --> 26:30.240
in the first place.

26:32.503 --> 26:34.418
I love being an alderman.

26:34.462 --> 26:37.073
I love it,
and I would never want

26:37.117 --> 26:40.033
to think that I take it
for granted, but...

26:40.076 --> 26:42.731
maybe because I was too young
when I started.

26:42.775 --> 26:44.646
I've been getting lazy

26:44.690 --> 26:48.215
and complacent
and a little numb.

26:48.258 --> 26:50.304
But now...

26:50.347 --> 26:52.480
because of you...

26:54.351 --> 26:56.571
I got a pulse again.

26:56.615 --> 26:57.920
And I'm not just talking
about this.

26:57.964 --> 27:00.314
I'm--I'm talking
about everything,

27:00.357 --> 27:03.273
all of me.

27:03.317 --> 27:04.710
You wanna think that's a line
from a politician,

27:04.753 --> 27:07.277
you go ahead
and think it, but...

27:07.321 --> 27:09.192
it's true.

27:12.805 --> 27:15.590
Let me do this for you.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.940
I need to do this.

27:21.030 --> 27:24.294
- ♪ How does it feel...

27:27.994 --> 27:30.474
♪ To know that you can't

27:30.518 --> 27:34.130
♪ Go on anymore

27:37.046 --> 27:39.658
- Well, if you're here
to give me legal advice,

27:39.701 --> 27:40.659
you can save it.

27:40.702 --> 27:41.703
- I'm not.

27:41.747 --> 27:42.835
But I do want to talk to you

27:42.878 --> 27:45.011
before you bring in
another lawyer.

27:47.753 --> 27:50.190
- I'm not bringing in
another lawyer.

27:51.844 --> 27:54.368
- What does that mean?
- You're the mayor's fixer.

27:54.411 --> 27:55.848
Fix it.
- Keri.

27:55.891 --> 27:57.980
- The last wrongful termination
suit against the city

27:58.024 --> 28:00.504
settled for a million,
so just find a number.

28:00.548 --> 28:01.810
- You can't give in.

28:01.854 --> 28:03.333
- Don't tell me what I can
and cannot do.

28:03.377 --> 28:04.726
I'm the city attorney.

28:04.770 --> 28:06.685
I can make a nuisance suit
go away by paying it off.

28:06.728 --> 28:09.383
- Look, I know
you're mad at me.

28:09.426 --> 28:10.558
- I'm not mad at you.

28:10.601 --> 28:13.692
I'm mad at myself
and this man and...

28:13.735 --> 28:14.823
everybody but you.

28:14.867 --> 28:16.346
You've made that
perfectly clear for me.

28:16.390 --> 28:18.392
- Then you know that giving in
isn't the way to go.

28:18.435 --> 28:19.567
- Pay him.

28:19.610 --> 28:21.961
- The man cheated people
out of millions

28:22.004 --> 28:23.571
and lined his own pockets,

28:23.614 --> 28:24.877
unless you are lying

28:24.920 --> 28:26.617
and you just made it up
to get his job.

28:26.661 --> 28:28.010
- Fuck you.
- That's not an answer.

28:28.054 --> 28:29.185
- I didn't.
You know I didn't.

28:29.229 --> 28:30.752
- And that's what the jury
will hear.

28:30.796 --> 28:33.320
- The jury's gonna hear
a woman who was sleeping

28:33.363 --> 28:35.496
with the soon-to-be mayor...

28:35.539 --> 28:37.803
and still is.

28:39.195 --> 28:41.850
There, I said it for you.
Hope you're happy.

28:41.894 --> 28:44.287
If this gets out,
Bobby will be crushed,

28:44.331 --> 28:46.507
but he'll recover.

28:46.550 --> 28:48.814
And me?

28:48.857 --> 28:51.599
No matter what anybody says,
I will always be the woman

28:51.642 --> 28:53.557
who slept her way to the top.

28:53.601 --> 28:56.212
It's different for women,
and you know that.

28:59.868 --> 29:02.392
I will never recover.

29:09.835 --> 29:11.837
- Nice going, Mayor Novak.

29:11.880 --> 29:14.361
Can't believe you actually
got him to sign off on this.

29:14.404 --> 29:16.624
- I didn't.

29:16.667 --> 29:18.147
- Oh.

29:18.191 --> 29:19.670
Shit.

29:19.714 --> 29:22.761
Is he mad?
- Yep, he's mad.

29:22.804 --> 29:23.936
- He shouldn't be.

29:23.979 --> 29:25.372
You not only kept him
in the running,

29:25.415 --> 29:26.895
but it says here that
we're one of the favorites.

29:26.939 --> 29:29.724
- It's my job to speak for him,
not to go behind his back

29:29.768 --> 29:31.770
and make promises
we can't deliver.

29:31.813 --> 29:33.119
- You could have just
told him that you were

29:33.162 --> 29:34.685
cleaning up after me,
if you wanted.

29:34.729 --> 29:36.035
- I don't throw people
under the bus.

29:36.078 --> 29:37.210
- Well, you could have,

29:37.253 --> 29:38.820
because I'm not ashamed
of my beliefs.

29:38.864 --> 29:40.604
- Damn.
- No, what?

29:40.648 --> 29:42.215
I'm serious.
- I know you are.

29:42.258 --> 29:44.957
Let me ask you something,
Yoli Castillo.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.262
Why do you want
to be here?

29:46.306 --> 29:47.611
- What do you mean?

29:47.655 --> 29:48.830
- Why do you want
to be part of government

29:48.874 --> 29:51.093
when you have zero respect
for how it works?

29:51.137 --> 29:52.529
- Because it doesn't work
for everyone.

29:52.573 --> 29:54.575
- Working for everyone
isn't practical

29:54.618 --> 29:55.794
or even possible.

29:55.837 --> 29:57.578
It's our job
to do the most good

29:57.621 --> 29:59.406
for the greatest number
of people.

29:59.449 --> 30:01.147
Wow.

30:01.190 --> 30:03.105
You really
sold your soul, huh?

30:03.149 --> 30:04.672
I hope you at least got
a good price for it.

30:04.715 --> 30:06.326
- I believe in a lot
of the same things you do.

30:06.369 --> 30:08.937
I'm just a lot smarter about
trying to get them done.

30:08.981 --> 30:10.417
- Funny, it looks like
I'm standing

30:10.460 --> 30:12.245
in the same place you are
by staying true to myself.

30:12.288 --> 30:13.855
- Well, the next time you want
to be true to yourself,

30:13.899 --> 30:15.901
don't take me down with you.

30:25.954 --> 30:27.869
- I shouldn't be meeting you
without my lawyer present.

30:27.913 --> 30:29.218
- You're smarter
than your lawyer.

30:29.262 --> 30:30.959
That's why I'm coming
right to you.

30:31.003 --> 30:32.091
- You think I can win,
don't you?

30:32.134 --> 30:33.875
- I think if you can
make it look like

30:33.919 --> 30:35.877
your ambitious
young protégé

30:35.921 --> 30:38.793
conspired with an equally
ambitious young alderman

30:38.837 --> 30:40.142
to take you down,

30:40.186 --> 30:43.058
that you might get
a jury to sympathize.

30:43.102 --> 30:44.668
- I'm glad you see it my way.

30:44.712 --> 30:46.540
- I said sympathize,
not win.

30:46.583 --> 30:48.194
But what you will
definitely get

30:48.237 --> 30:50.457
is to exact your revenge
on Keri and Bobby,

30:50.500 --> 30:53.199
which is what you
really want, isn't it?

30:53.242 --> 30:54.853
- They destroyed my career,
Ms. Pearson.

30:54.896 --> 30:57.681
- No, you destroyed your career
when you decided

30:57.725 --> 31:00.946
to bury evidence
and cheat innocent people.

31:00.989 --> 31:03.731
No wonder you look like hell.
Guilt'll do that.

31:03.774 --> 31:05.254
- Look, if I had the chance
to do it over,

31:05.298 --> 31:06.908
I might make
some different choices.

31:06.952 --> 31:08.867
But putting $10 million
into public schools

31:08.910 --> 31:11.130
instead of paying damages
to a kid who skipped school

31:11.173 --> 31:12.914
to jump between train cars?

31:12.958 --> 31:14.524
I think that was
a fair trade.

31:14.568 --> 31:15.743
- And that sounds like a man

31:15.786 --> 31:17.049
who's still justifying
his actions.

31:17.092 --> 31:18.659
- Sounds a lot like you,
doesn't it?

31:18.702 --> 31:20.313
Two powerful attorneys
who crossed lines

31:20.356 --> 31:22.750
to do what they thought
was right,

31:22.793 --> 31:24.752
only I don't have a mayor
to bail me out.

31:24.795 --> 31:26.841
- Well, that's where
you're wrong,

31:26.885 --> 31:29.800
because your bail
is set at $1 million,

31:29.844 --> 31:31.802
and the city's willing
to pay it.

31:35.415 --> 31:37.939
You know, um...

31:37.983 --> 31:40.724
I've spent my career convincing
law students like Keri

31:40.768 --> 31:42.901
that, uh, it wasn't the money.

31:42.944 --> 31:45.773
It was the privilege to serve
that would drive them.

31:45.816 --> 31:48.123
- You lost that privilege,
Mr. Sharma.

31:48.167 --> 31:50.996
- Oh, I lost
a lot more than that.

31:51.039 --> 31:53.868
I mean, look at me.

31:53.912 --> 31:56.740
I gave the city 20 years,

31:56.784 --> 31:59.743
20 years.

31:59.787 --> 32:03.356
And now I'm nothing in it.

32:03.399 --> 32:05.488
Keep your money.

32:18.849 --> 32:21.113
- Don't tell me,
the mayor fired you

32:21.156 --> 32:22.592
and you're coming back
to New York.

32:22.636 --> 32:24.029
Hardly.

32:24.072 --> 32:26.248
- You took over and you
renamed the city Pearson.

32:26.292 --> 32:29.251
- That's more like it.
- How are you, Jessica?

32:29.295 --> 32:31.601
- I'm just fine,
thank you very much,

32:31.645 --> 32:32.776
but I do need a favor.

32:32.820 --> 32:34.039
- I can be on
the first plane out.

32:34.082 --> 32:35.954
- Save your miles for Tahiti.

32:35.997 --> 32:37.999
You can do this
from right where you are.

32:38.043 --> 32:41.872
- Good, I wasn't about
to battle airport traffic.

32:41.916 --> 32:44.527
What do you need?

32:53.058 --> 32:54.885
- Oh, man.

32:54.929 --> 32:56.757
You should have seen
the look on Sharma's face

32:56.800 --> 32:59.151
when I exposed his corrupt ass
to the city council.

32:59.194 --> 33:00.891
It was beautiful.

33:00.935 --> 33:03.372
Now I'm ready to run.

33:03.416 --> 33:05.766
What's the matter, Pat?

33:05.809 --> 33:07.637
City attorney
a friend of yours?

33:07.681 --> 33:09.161
- No.

33:09.204 --> 33:10.945
No, your--
your big money backers

33:10.989 --> 33:13.208
were friends with him,
and now they've all pulled out.

33:13.252 --> 33:14.905
- Fuck them.
- "Fuck them"?

33:14.949 --> 33:16.690
- This is our ticket
to a whole new revenue stream

33:16.733 --> 33:19.127
now that the voters know
I'm gonna clean this shit up.

33:19.171 --> 33:20.346
- You idiot.

33:20.389 --> 33:21.825
And your father said
you were the smart one.

33:21.869 --> 33:23.392
- Let's leave him
out of this.

33:23.436 --> 33:25.003
- You think I'm helping you out
of the goodness of my heart?

33:25.046 --> 33:27.788
Your old man and I,
we had an arrangement.

33:27.831 --> 33:30.443
- What the hell
are you talking about?

33:33.098 --> 33:35.404
- Tommy Diehl.

33:35.448 --> 33:39.278
- Look what happened
to Diehl made me sick,

33:39.321 --> 33:41.715
but everybody knows
he was dirty.

33:41.758 --> 33:43.238
And he had nothing
to do with me.

33:43.282 --> 33:45.632
- No, he had everything
to do with you.

33:45.675 --> 33:48.026
Quid pro quo, Bobby boy.

33:48.069 --> 33:50.941
Quid pro quo.

33:50.985 --> 33:52.813
- Are you saying my old man
took care of Diehl?

33:52.856 --> 33:55.859
- And in exchange,
I make his son mayor.

33:55.903 --> 33:57.861
- Jesus Christ.

33:59.646 --> 34:02.083
I don't want your help.
I don't need it.

34:02.127 --> 34:03.389
- You don't get
a choice in this.

34:03.432 --> 34:04.955
- The hell I don't!

34:04.999 --> 34:07.088
After today, I won't have
any trouble raising money.

34:07.132 --> 34:08.698
- Oh, okay, Bobby.

34:08.742 --> 34:11.527
All right, you--you go out
and you find other backing

34:11.571 --> 34:13.834
'cause you're a talented,
charismatic guy,

34:13.877 --> 34:15.923
but that's all
you'll ever be.

34:15.966 --> 34:18.491
You're not becoming mayor
if the public finds out

34:18.534 --> 34:19.840
that your family was involved

34:19.883 --> 34:23.104
in the disappearance
of a union boss.

34:31.939 --> 34:33.462
Cheer up.

34:33.506 --> 34:35.943
You're gonna be
an important man.

34:40.382 --> 34:42.819
To your campaign.

34:42.863 --> 34:45.344
You can start
by getting rid of the girl.

34:57.312 --> 34:59.314
- B3 still sticking?
- Hi.

34:59.358 --> 35:00.968
- Hi.
- Yeah.

35:01.011 --> 35:02.883
It's all right.

35:08.889 --> 35:11.544
Thank you.

35:11.587 --> 35:14.851
- Um, can we go somewhere
and talk?

35:14.895 --> 35:17.332
- Listen, you don't have to
worry about stringing together

35:17.376 --> 35:19.334
some lame version
of, "I'm a jerk

35:19.378 --> 35:20.553
"that slept with you once

35:20.596 --> 35:22.076
and I don't have time
for a relationship."

35:22.120 --> 35:25.688
- That's not what I wanted
to talk to you about.

35:25.732 --> 35:27.690
- Either way, thank you
for what you did for me.

35:27.734 --> 35:28.865
- I should be thanking you.

35:28.909 --> 35:31.216
It's gonna be a boon
to my career.

35:31.259 --> 35:34.828
And it made me feel like myself
for the first time in a while.

35:34.871 --> 35:37.047
- Listen, Bobby,
now that, um, Sherma's out,

35:37.091 --> 35:38.614
work is different for me.

35:38.658 --> 35:41.661
I really need people to know
that I'm here on my own merits.

35:41.704 --> 35:44.359
- And not because some alderman
took an interest in you.

35:44.403 --> 35:46.840
- Yeah.

35:46.883 --> 35:50.322
- Somebody say something?
- No, they didn't need to.

35:52.585 --> 35:54.369
- And that's the whole reason?

35:54.413 --> 35:55.892
- That and the fact
that you're married,

35:55.936 --> 35:57.459
and I don't want
to be the reason

35:57.503 --> 35:58.721
you don't go back
to your wife.

35:58.765 --> 36:01.550
That's not something
I can deal with.

36:01.594 --> 36:03.596
- Just so you know,

36:03.639 --> 36:06.207
I ever make it
to that fifth floor office,

36:06.251 --> 36:07.687
I'm taking you with me.

36:07.730 --> 36:09.776
- Yeah, you gonna
run for mayor?

36:09.819 --> 36:12.561
- Uh, I'm thinking about it.

36:12.605 --> 36:14.607
- What do you think?

36:14.650 --> 36:17.000
Would you vote for me?

36:18.611 --> 36:20.526
I might.

36:20.569 --> 36:22.049
- It's a deal then.

36:22.092 --> 36:25.487
Can't shortchange
that meteoric rise, can we?

36:44.289 --> 36:46.943
It's over.

36:46.987 --> 36:49.207
- Hmm?
- Your problem.

36:49.250 --> 36:51.078
It's over.

36:51.121 --> 36:52.253
- How much?

36:52.297 --> 36:55.038
- Didn't cost
the city a dime.

36:58.303 --> 37:00.000
You didn't cut all my ties

37:00.043 --> 37:02.698
when you took a knife
to my career.

37:02.742 --> 37:04.657
I still have powerful friends
in New York.

37:04.700 --> 37:06.441
I made a call.
- To who?

37:06.485 --> 37:07.790
What's gonna happen to him?

37:07.834 --> 37:10.619
- They're lawyers, Keri,
not mobsters.

37:10.663 --> 37:13.274
Harvey Specter
is connecting him

37:13.318 --> 37:14.667
with some corporate firms

37:14.710 --> 37:17.844
in the market
for a Michael Clayton.

37:17.887 --> 37:20.150
- So that's it?
He's willing to just walk away,

37:20.194 --> 37:23.241
no revenge, no payout?
- He didn't want the money.

37:23.284 --> 37:24.677
He wanted his name back.

37:24.720 --> 37:26.156
He wasn't gonna get
that in Chicago.

37:26.200 --> 37:28.028
- So you rewarded him
with a new job

37:28.071 --> 37:29.464
after the shitting the bed
in his old one.

37:29.508 --> 37:31.553
God, that's
a real sweet deal.

37:31.597 --> 37:33.120
- I did for him
what Bobby did for me.

37:33.163 --> 37:35.296
And I can tell you
from experience,

37:35.340 --> 37:37.080
starting over isn't easy.

37:37.124 --> 37:39.474
He won't be living large
in exile.

37:41.520 --> 37:44.262
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

37:44.305 --> 37:46.220
And I'm sorry.

37:46.264 --> 37:47.265
- For what?

37:47.308 --> 37:48.353
- I never should have
questioned

37:48.396 --> 37:49.832
how you got your job.

37:49.876 --> 37:53.836
The truth is, Bobby is mayor
because of you.

37:53.880 --> 37:57.492
Nobody knows it....

37:57.536 --> 37:59.668
and I wish they did.

38:02.715 --> 38:04.630
- Thank you.

38:17.643 --> 38:19.819
- What's the status
of my Ickaris assignment?

38:19.862 --> 38:21.821
- All taken care of.

38:21.864 --> 38:23.736
- Sounds like Everett
was satisfied

38:23.779 --> 38:25.128
with your presentation.

38:25.172 --> 38:27.914
- He's on a plane home
right now singing our praises.

38:27.957 --> 38:29.568
- And how much ass-kissing
did Derrick have to do

38:29.611 --> 38:32.353
to clean up your mess?

38:32.397 --> 38:34.094
Give me one good reason

38:34.137 --> 38:37.053
why I shouldn't fire you
right now.

38:38.794 --> 38:40.361
- I'm sorry.

38:40.405 --> 38:42.842
- I'm almost never wrong
about a person, Yoli.

38:42.885 --> 38:45.192
But maybe I was when I thought
I saw something in you.

38:45.235 --> 38:47.890
- No, you weren't.
You're wrong now.

38:47.934 --> 38:49.283
- If you're gonna correct me,

38:49.327 --> 38:51.241
then you'd better have
a damn good explanation.

38:51.285 --> 38:53.331
- I'm the voice
this place is missing.

38:53.374 --> 38:55.898
I'm passionate about the things
that are important,

38:55.942 --> 38:59.206
and I am not afraid to push on
the issues that I care about.

38:59.249 --> 39:01.121
Isn't that what
we're supposed to do here?

39:01.164 --> 39:03.166
- Not if it costs us
valuable relationships

39:03.210 --> 39:04.167
and opportunities.

39:04.211 --> 39:05.604
- I know I can be
a lot sometimes,

39:05.647 --> 39:08.563
but I'm not stupid.

39:08.607 --> 39:10.304
I can learn how
to do this job,

39:10.348 --> 39:12.437
but you can't teach passion.

39:12.480 --> 39:15.091
So please...

39:15.135 --> 39:17.790
just give me another chance.

39:20.836 --> 39:23.752
- One shot.

39:23.796 --> 39:26.581

I'm not stalking you.

39:42.945 --> 39:44.120
I tried calling but, uh,

39:44.164 --> 39:45.557
did I leave my watch

39:45.600 --> 39:47.776

40:37.304 --> 40:38.305
- Sorry?

40:38.348 --> 40:39.828
- It's why I told Bobby
I understood

40:39.872 --> 40:41.221
what he was going through.

40:41.264 --> 40:43.092
It tore me apart,

40:43.136 --> 40:45.355
knowing that someone
that I loved,

40:45.399 --> 40:48.271
no matter how complicated
it was, was suffering.

40:48.315 --> 40:50.404
And even though
I was so in control

40:50.448 --> 40:51.927
of everything all day,

40:51.971 --> 40:54.060
I was powerless
to do anything about it.

40:54.103 --> 40:57.977
I had to stand by and watch,

40:58.020 --> 41:00.806
and I'm not
very good at that.

41:00.849 --> 41:01.981
- Why didn't you tell Bobby?

41:02.024 --> 41:05.201
- Because the story ends
with a man dying,

41:05.245 --> 41:08.553
and I don't think he's ready
to hear that right now.

41:10.555 --> 41:12.600
- He might appreciate
a little empathy.

41:12.644 --> 41:15.168
- But I don't really
understand it.

41:15.211 --> 41:20.434
My ex-husband was diagnosed
after we were divorced.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.697
I don't know
how I would have handled it

41:22.741 --> 41:27.006
had it happened
during our marriage.

41:27.049 --> 41:31.837
I like to think
I'm a better person now, but...

41:31.880 --> 41:33.621
- Yeah, I think
you're a better person

41:33.665 --> 41:35.797
than even you think you are.
