02:44.632 --> 02:47.666
You know it looks more suspicious
if you stand outside, right?

04:33.973 --> 04:35.774
Shh.

04:51.658 --> 04:53.325
Come on. Just touch it.

04:53.327 --> 04:54.860
No.

04:54.862 --> 04:56.928
It's not gonna bite.

05:15.715 --> 05:17.582
Come here.
No.

05:21.888 --> 05:23.488
Stop.

through the door. Okay.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.004
<i>Please exit through the rear door.</i>

06:20.480 --> 06:22.481
He's too cute.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.449
Yeah.

06:24.451 --> 06:27.819
He, uh, went down on me
for the first time last week.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.621
He did?

06:29.623 --> 06:33.658
Yeah. It was good, but he
definitely needs practice.

06:33.660 --> 06:36.828
Yeah. I hate it when
they need practice.

07:00.953 --> 07:03.822
If you're not gonna feed
the dog, neither am I.

07:03.824 --> 07:06.591
We don't even have dog food.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.193
You know where the money is.

07:08.195 --> 07:10.862
You go to the store, you
buy things for yourself.

07:11.798 --> 07:13.198
What's in there, coffee?

07:13.200 --> 07:15.434
Anything good?

07:27.613 --> 07:29.214
Should we euthanize her?

07:32.485 --> 07:35.153
Let's do it. For fun.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.790
Much easier than fighting.

07:59.846 --> 08:02.681
Why are you still wearing
your bathing suit?

08:02.683 --> 08:05.116
It's summer. It's hot.

08:15.261 --> 08:16.828
Let's play a game.

08:19.198 --> 08:21.633
I thought you wanted to watch TV.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.502
I did, but now I'm bored.

08:25.538 --> 08:26.938
Dare.

08:27.807 --> 08:29.741
Like truth or dare?

08:30.543 --> 08:31.843
Like what?

08:31.845 --> 08:33.511
It could be anything.

08:36.782 --> 08:38.517
Come on.
Use your imagination.

08:49.195 --> 08:53.098
It's just not the kind of game
you play with two people.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.033
It's just more fun
with a group, you know?

09:03.276 --> 09:05.243
How 'bout checkers?

09:24.664 --> 09:26.064
Come on.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.666
Come on.

09:29.135 --> 09:31.736
Come on. Please.

09:34.073 --> 09:35.941
Please. Please.

09:39.879 --> 09:42.681
Come on. Come on.

09:56.762 --> 09:59.798
I love how dark I get
during the summer.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.801
Sometimes I get so dark people
actually think I'm black.

10:02.803 --> 10:05.036
Shut up.
It's true.

10:39.939 --> 10:41.673
Do you have any tampons?

10:41.675 --> 10:43.274
No.

10:43.276 --> 10:46.077
Nothing?

10:46.079 --> 10:49.914
I'm kind of irregular, so I
don't need them that much.

10:49.916 --> 10:52.350
That's gonna be a big problem
once you start having sex.

11:35.261 --> 11:36.995
Hey, Chiara!

11:36.997 --> 11:39.431
Oh, hey, Sammy.
How's your summer been?

11:39.433 --> 11:42.333
- It's going good. You?
- Fine.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.069
Do you still work at hall of fame?

11:44.071 --> 11:46.137
Yeah. You should stop by
sometime and say hi.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.139
Okay. All right.
See ya.

11:56.415 --> 11:59.050
No. He's just some guy I
know from my neighborhood.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.319
You sure you never dated him?
No. He's a douche.

12:01.321 --> 12:03.121
He'd fuck anything.

13:27.973 --> 13:30.108
Who was that?
Just some girl I was hanging out with.

13:30.110 --> 13:31.910
Who?

13:31.912 --> 13:33.378
Just some girl.

13:33.380 --> 13:34.946
What's her name?

13:36.081 --> 13:37.582
Jessica.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.317
Is she in your grade?

13:39.319 --> 13:42.520
She's in sixth, going into seventh.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.322
We made out.

13:45.224 --> 13:47.325
You did?
Yeah.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.960
It was all her idea.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.829
I met a guy.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.831
Cool. Where?

13:52.833 --> 13:54.532
At the beach.

13:54.534 --> 13:57.101
He went down on me.

13:57.103 --> 13:59.971
All right.

13:59.973 --> 14:03.341
It was good, but he needs practice.

14:04.543 --> 14:06.444
So, what are you doing later?

14:06.446 --> 14:10.148
Probably going out.

14:10.150 --> 14:14.853
All right. So, I'll just
come over after dinner.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.189
Wanna help?

14:51.191 --> 14:52.657
No.

15:05.638 --> 15:08.373
What else do you have to do today?
Stuff.

15:08.375 --> 15:11.009
Like?
Stuff.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.044
You used to like to help.

15:29.295 --> 15:32.030
<i>Please exit through the rear door.</i>

15:44.009 --> 15:46.244
You can't get her or whatever.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.712
I was, like, "all right. Watch me."

15:47.714 --> 15:50.014
I walk over to introduce myself.

15:50.016 --> 15:51.482
Bro, this girl is 35 years old.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.184
Thirty-five?
Thirty-five.

15:53.186 --> 15:55.119
How'd that go?
I didn't think I was gonna get it.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.654
Talked to her about five minutes.

15:56.656 --> 15:59.424
Next thing you know, boom, got
her number, and that was it.

15:59.426 --> 16:02.360
Maybe that's cause there
was no more alcohol left.

16:02.362 --> 16:05.063
I took a walk to mobil.

16:05.065 --> 16:08.099
And, like, this guy is
standing at the window,

16:08.101 --> 16:09.968
and he's taking mad long.

16:09.970 --> 16:12.103
And I'm, like, "hurry the fuck up.
I'm trying to get my beer."

16:12.105 --> 16:14.038
He's like,
"oh, shut up."

16:14.040 --> 16:18.109
Did you hit him?
Yeah. This hand is killing me.

16:18.111 --> 16:20.745
Yeah?
Yeah. I knocked him out.

16:23.349 --> 16:25.049
Hi.
Hey.

16:25.051 --> 16:27.185
How's it going?
Good.

16:27.187 --> 16:31.456
Cool, uh, I was just in the
neighborhood. Shopping.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.224
Where do you live?

16:33.226 --> 16:34.759
Gravesend.

16:34.761 --> 16:36.427
And you were shopping around here?

16:36.429 --> 16:38.162
Yeah.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.732
Mmm.

16:40.734 --> 16:42.333
How do I know you again?

16:42.335 --> 16:44.435
The beach.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.604
That's right.
You look different.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.439
Yeah.

16:48.441 --> 16:51.376
So, do you go to murrow with Chiara?
Yeah.

16:52.478 --> 16:54.112
That's a nerdy school, right?

16:54.114 --> 16:56.381
Like, it is and it isn't.

16:56.383 --> 16:57.782
Mm-hmm.

17:03.622 --> 17:05.455
What school do you go to?

17:05.458 --> 17:07.025
Kingsborough.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.292
High school or college?

17:10.496 --> 17:12.262
College.

17:21.673 --> 17:24.742
Um, I should get back to work.

17:24.743 --> 17:28.413
Yeah. Uh, do you have matches?

17:28.415 --> 17:29.781
You know that's bad for you, right?

17:29.783 --> 17:31.682
Yeah.

17:52.471 --> 17:54.338
Lila, you're late again.

17:55.774 --> 17:58.409

20:58.023 --> 21:00.358
What's your favorite
way to masturbate?

21:01.827 --> 21:03.394
What? Just tell me.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.999
All right. So, show me.
No.

21:08.001 --> 21:09.667
Just show me.
No.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.535
Come on.
Nope.

21:12.738 --> 21:14.372
No.

21:15.641 --> 21:18.843
Have you ever made out with lila?

21:18.845 --> 21:21.545
I've made out with all
my girlfriends but lila.

21:23.949 --> 21:25.616
I think you should
make out with lila.

21:28.854 --> 21:32.456
Lila?

21:32.458 --> 21:33.824
No. Thanks.

21:34.660 --> 21:35.793
Why not?

21:36.995 --> 21:38.863
'Cause you could have
herpes or something.

21:38.865 --> 21:40.631
Thanks.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.333
I'd rather have herpes than rabies.

21:43.802 --> 21:46.804
Oh.

22:04.957 --> 22:08.492
<i>You've reached the offices of the
president of the United States.</i>

22:08.494 --> 22:10.628
<i>Nah. I'm playing.</i>
<i>This is Sammy.</i>

22:10.630 --> 22:12.063
<i>If I call you back, I call you.</i>

22:12.065 --> 22:14.699
<i>If I don't, then, oh well.</i>

22:58.910 --> 23:01.045
It feels so nice.

23:01.047 --> 23:03.481
Nice?
Really nice.

23:18.864 --> 23:20.498
I really wanna be with you.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.533
Keep going.

23:22.535 --> 23:25.469
Like, I wanna <i> be</i> with you,
be with you.

23:25.471 --> 23:26.904
I don't know.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.506
Why?

23:29.975 --> 23:31.742
'Cause you've been with other guys.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.477
Three.

23:33.479 --> 23:35.179
Three's a lot
when you think about it.

23:35.181 --> 23:38.115
You know, one, two, three.

23:41.520 --> 23:43.053
Is it?

23:43.055 --> 23:45.055
Don't stop.

23:47.659 --> 23:49.894
Why does it bother you?

23:49.896 --> 23:53.764
It doesn't.
Just forget it.

25:30.829 --> 25:32.730
<i>Yo.</i>
Hey, Sammy?

25:32.732 --> 25:36.300
<i>Yeah.</i>
It's lila, Chiara's friend.

25:36.302 --> 25:38.702
<i>You forgot your shit here.</i>

25:38.704 --> 25:41.171
Yeah, I... I kind
of need them back.

25:41.173 --> 25:44.008
<i>I'm at work. You can</i>
<i>swing by and grab them.</i>

25:44.010 --> 25:46.877
Um, can I maybe meet you
after work tomorrow?

26:05.630 --> 26:07.698
Look what Patrick got me.

26:15.206 --> 26:17.608
Shh.

26:26.017 --> 26:29.253
Stick your finger in there.
They'll suck on it.

26:29.255 --> 26:30.854
No.

26:33.925 --> 26:35.359
They don't have teeth.

26:36.728 --> 26:38.862
You do it and tell me
what it feels like.

26:40.231 --> 26:42.066
You're scared of everything.

26:42.068 --> 26:44.368
I'm not, but think what you want.

27:30.949 --> 27:32.683
Get on.

27:36.955 --> 27:38.822
Do you get dizzy easy?

27:38.824 --> 27:41.225
No.
Uh-huh.

29:26.030 --> 29:28.232
Boo!

29:28.234 --> 29:31.101
Sorry. I was just taking a piss.

29:31.103 --> 29:32.469
Come on.
This way.

29:35.940 --> 29:38.509
Do you have a boyfriend?

29:38.511 --> 29:40.344
No.

29:40.346 --> 29:42.846
Chiara's always got boyfriends.

29:42.848 --> 29:44.815
Well, that's different.

29:44.817 --> 29:46.817
Why?

29:46.819 --> 29:48.185
'Cause she's needy.

30:08.306 --> 30:10.007
Can I ask you something?

30:10.009 --> 30:11.809
Sure.

30:11.811 --> 30:13.443
Do you want something from me?

30:16.047 --> 30:17.514
What would I want anyways?

31:23.381 --> 31:24.982
Oh, fuck.

31:27.252 --> 31:28.652
Fuck.

31:33.925 --> 31:35.459
Fuck. Shit.

32:26.678 --> 32:29.079
What's Chiara doing tonight?

32:29.081 --> 32:32.282
Out with her new boyfriend.

32:32.284 --> 32:34.484
Who's her new boyfriend?

32:35.620 --> 32:37.487
This guy, Patrick.

32:40.692 --> 32:45.195
It's kind of serious.
He gave her a promise ring.

32:46.297 --> 32:48.632
It won't last.
It might.

32:48.634 --> 32:50.968
It won't.

32:50.970 --> 32:52.536
You're so pessimistic.

32:52.538 --> 32:56.173
I'm not pessimistic, but,
trust me, it won't last.

32:56.175 --> 32:58.608
They're in love, so it might.

32:59.711 --> 33:02.212
They're not in love.
Yes. They are.

33:03.081 --> 33:04.481
Oh.

33:09.220 --> 33:11.755
No. No.
That's right.
Discipline the animal.

33:13.291 --> 33:16.259
Hear? Try spanking him.

33:16.261 --> 33:17.728
Like this.

33:17.730 --> 33:19.463
Stop.

34:36.206 --> 34:40.143
Yo, does your dog like to get high?

34:40.145 --> 34:41.645
I don't know.

34:41.647 --> 34:43.313
What's the dog's name?

34:43.315 --> 34:45.148
Coffee.

34:45.150 --> 34:46.616
What kind of name is that?

34:48.485 --> 34:51.188
You named your dog after
a hot fucking beverage?

34:51.190 --> 34:53.322
Ignore them.
They're just being dicks.

35:17.416 --> 35:20.650
She's so hot.
So hot.

35:20.652 --> 35:23.286
Gross. Why is she
rubbing herself like that?

35:23.288 --> 35:24.688
'Cause it gets her off.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.423
Looks painful.

35:33.798 --> 35:36.266
Her titties are kind of perky.

35:36.268 --> 35:37.767
She's got peach titties.

35:37.769 --> 35:39.469
She's got a nice ass.

35:39.471 --> 35:41.638
I remember one time I made a porn.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.773
My ex-girl found the video.

35:43.775 --> 35:47.410
She didn't like it so much.

35:47.412 --> 35:48.778
Punched me in my face.

35:50.481 --> 35:53.884
I still got to keep
the porno, though.

35:53.886 --> 35:55.852
I've thought about doing that.

35:55.854 --> 35:58.255
Doing what?

35:58.257 --> 36:00.257
Like, as a career option.

36:00.259 --> 36:02.826
Really?

36:02.828 --> 36:07.564
Yeah, totally. Like, the hours are
really good and so is the pay.

36:07.566 --> 36:12.435
And I like sex, a lot.
Like, a lot, a lot.

36:12.437 --> 36:15.672
She's not very good.
I've seen better.

36:15.674 --> 36:17.607
What's your name again?

36:17.609 --> 36:19.442
Lila.

36:19.444 --> 36:23.180
Lila, why don't you come and
put your ass right here?

36:23.182 --> 36:24.862
So I can smack your ass
with this paddle...

36:26.217 --> 36:27.817
Till it turns sore.

36:27.819 --> 36:30.320
Turn that white ass red.

37:22.440 --> 37:25.942
I should go.
I have to get up early.

37:25.944 --> 37:28.378
It's the weekend.

37:28.380 --> 37:30.347
Yeah, but, my mom's

No.

Just look.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.509
I'm sure you're fine.

39:39.511 --> 39:41.010
Just look.

39:41.979 --> 39:44.013
What am I looking for exactly?

39:45.049 --> 39:47.550
Does it look red or irritated?

39:47.552 --> 39:49.786
I-I don't know.

39:49.788 --> 39:51.554
I would do this for you.

39:51.556 --> 39:52.889
I really don't know.

39:54.125 --> 39:56.426

been scratching it.

39:56.428 --> 39:59.896
I have. That's why you're checking

I'm sure you'll be fine.

42:40.090 --> 42:42.959

A little, anyway.

42:55.072 --> 42:57.807

42:57.809 --> 43:00.043

43:01.680 --> 43:04.781
No. Say it.

43:04.783 --> 43:07.917
Don't make me say it.

would be untrue,

to talk to you.

47:24.843 --> 47:27.176
My hands are kind of full.

47:27.178 --> 47:29.178

47:29.180 --> 47:31.614
I don't really want
to talk about that here.

47:34.318 --> 47:36.953

47:49.600 --> 47:52.435
Wow. You really cleaned up.

47:59.611 --> 48:02.378
No.
Please.

I'm not drunk.
I'm just hot.

52:24.608 --> 52:26.642
I-I can't.

52:26.644 --> 52:28.911
Open your mouth.

52:28.913 --> 52:30.779
Why?
I'll do it.

52:30.781 --> 52:33.382
Why?
Open your mouth.

53:02.345 --> 53:04.446
There's puke in your hair.

53:04.448 --> 53:08.184
Get it off me.
No. Do it yourself.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.668
I don't know what
you're talking about.

53:59.670 --> 54:03.305
Oh, you wanna go again? Like...
I don't understand, man.

54:03.307 --> 54:07.476
Bro, what the fuck?

54:08.878 --> 54:11.413
What about your dick?

54:13.516 --> 54:16.552
Thanks a lot, Devon.
Thanks a lot, man.

54:16.554 --> 54:18.821
I always got you, bro.

54:59.496 --> 55:02.531
I gotta, gotta be up at 6:00 A.M.

55:02.533 --> 55:04.366
Can you set my alarm?

55:04.368 --> 55:06.435
Am I your mother?

Hi.

58:31.875 --> 58:33.709
Where are you going?

58:33.711 --> 58:35.777
Work.

58:35.779 --> 58:37.646
Sucks.
Yeah.

59:27.630 --> 59:30.032
- Please don't do that.
- I don't mind.

59:30.034 --> 59:31.833
It's my fucking mess.

59:34.337 --> 59:36.305
I said stop it.

01:00:34.097 --> 01:00:37.199
I spent the night
with this guy last night.

01:00:37.201 --> 01:00:39.134
Who?

01:00:39.136 --> 01:00:42.871
He's a friend of a friend.
Is he your boyfriend?

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:49.945
No, but it's kind of better
than a boyfriend, you know?

01:00:49.947 --> 01:00:53.382
No.
It's kind of more exciting.

01:00:53.384 --> 01:00:56.385
That sounds too exciting.

01:00:56.387 --> 01:00:59.087
It's hard to describe.

01:01:01.057 --> 01:01:02.691
Are you just getting home?

01:01:02.693 --> 01:01:05.227
My dad's gonna kill me.

01:01:05.229 --> 01:01:07.863
Maybe you should go.

01:01:07.865 --> 01:01:09.865
I will.

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:13.835
What're you gonna tell him?

01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:15.937
I don't think I can lie.

01:01:15.939 --> 01:01:18.306
That would just make it worse.

01:01:18.308 --> 01:01:20.008
If you hear screaming,
call the cops.

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:22.044
Shut up.

01:01:22.046 --> 01:01:24.946
I'm serious.

01:01:24.948 --> 01:01:27.849
Just tell him you were
at Chiara's, or something.

01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:42.831
You're really late.
It's really early.

01:01:42.833 --> 01:01:46.401
Don't bullshit me. What are
you gonna do, punish me?

01:01:46.403 --> 01:01:49.738
No. If you don't give a
shit, I don't give a shit.

01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:51.707
Don't you wanna know where I was?
No.

01:01:51.709 --> 01:01:54.743
Stop trying to pique my interest.

01:01:54.745 --> 01:01:58.113
Chiara's? Nate's?

01:01:58.115 --> 01:02:01.717
I was with this guy.
Who?

01:02:01.719 --> 01:02:05.053
You don't know him.
You don't have a guy
that I don't know about.

01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:08.490
If you did,
believe me, I would know.

01:02:10.827 --> 01:02:12.828
Hang that up when you take it off.

01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:15.397
I don't want to see it crumpled
up in the corner of your room.

01:02:15.399 --> 01:02:17.466
Please.
Fine.

01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:41.323
<i>You've reached the offices of the
president of the United States.</i>

01:02:41.325 --> 01:02:43.525
<i>No, I'm playing.</i>
<i>This is Sammy.</i>

01:02:43.527 --> 01:02:47.262
<i>If I call you back, I call you.</i>
<i>If I don't, then, oh well.</i>

01:02:53.169 --> 01:02:55.437
- Hi.
-  Yo.

01:02:55.439 --> 01:02:57.839
I...
what do you want?

01:02:57.841 --> 01:02:59.941
I called you before.

01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:03.411
I'm working.
I figured.

01:03:03.413 --> 01:03:06.815
What's up?
You know.

01:03:06.817 --> 01:03:11.086
What? Look, I'd love to hang,
but I'm kind of busy.

01:03:11.088 --> 01:03:13.388
My dad freaked
that I came home so early.

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:15.957
He'll get over it.
I hope so.

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:17.425
He will.

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:24.132
Do you mind if I hang here?
That's not such a good idea.

01:03:39.949 --> 01:03:43.151
I really don't think I could
be high enough to pass out,

01:03:43.153 --> 01:03:45.287
then fuck you, and not remember it.

01:03:45.289 --> 01:03:49.457
We were really drunk.
Do you get what I'm saying?

01:03:49.459 --> 01:03:52.494
But you have had
that happen before, right?

01:04:07.243 --> 01:04:09.244
Hi.

01:04:11.948 --> 01:04:14.115
Sorry about the other night.

01:04:14.117 --> 01:04:16.117
I just didn't want you
to do something stupid.

01:04:16.119 --> 01:04:17.853
I know.

01:04:17.855 --> 01:04:19.955
Did you do something stupid?

01:04:19.957 --> 01:04:23.225
I don't know.
It's kind of a blur.

01:04:23.227 --> 01:04:25.527
How blurry?
Did you sleep with him?

01:04:25.529 --> 01:04:28.296
I don't know. Maybe.

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:33.501
Is everything okay?

01:04:49.185 --> 01:04:51.987
I'm gonna see if I can
get you an appointment.

01:04:51.989 --> 01:04:55.190
Please don't.
No. This is not okay.

01:04:55.192 --> 01:04:56.992
You don't know where he's been.
Please don't.

01:04:56.994 --> 01:04:58.960
I'm sure it's fine.

01:05:24.387 --> 01:05:26.288
I'm gonna take out
the speculum now,

01:05:26.290 --> 01:05:28.290
so I need you
to take a deep breath.

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:39.634
It's a bit early
for the first pap smear.

01:05:39.636 --> 01:05:44.539
We usually don't do them until
the patient is sexually active,

01:05:44.541 --> 01:05:48.209
or until after
the patient turns 21.

01:05:48.211 --> 01:05:52.547
At your age, I would recommend...

01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:55.483
Um, an HPV vaccine.

01:06:00.222 --> 01:06:02.657
Your gown is on backwards.

01:06:02.659 --> 01:06:07.295
Can I ask you a few questions?
Sure.

01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:10.332
Do you smoke?
At parties.

01:06:10.334 --> 01:06:13.401
How many alcoholic beverages
do you consume in a week?

01:06:13.403 --> 01:06:16.671
Like 60 ounces a week.

01:06:16.673 --> 01:06:19.007
Do you remember
to wear your seat belt...

01:06:19.009 --> 01:06:21.609
Every time you get
into a car or taxi?

01:06:21.611 --> 01:06:23.979
I try.

01:06:23.981 --> 01:06:26.214
And how often do you menstruate?
I don't know.

01:06:26.216 --> 01:06:27.716
Monthly?
Maybe.

01:06:27.718 --> 01:06:30.986
Every two months?
Sounds right.

01:06:30.988 --> 01:06:34.289
Would you like to be tested for STDs?
No.

01:06:34.291 --> 01:06:36.558
Do you have any history
of high blood pressure,

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:38.727
cancer or heart disease
in your family?

01:06:38.729 --> 01:06:40.528
Yes.
Which?

01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:43.631
Cancer.
Who, and what kind?

01:06:43.633 --> 01:06:45.400
Mom. Breast cancer.

01:06:45.402 --> 01:06:48.503
At what age was she diagnosed?
I don't remember.

01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:51.272
Alive or deceased?

01:06:51.274 --> 01:06:53.375
Deceased.

01:06:55.611 --> 01:06:58.146
I would like you
to consider participating...

01:06:58.148 --> 01:07:01.783
In a surveillance program at some
point in the next few years.

01:07:06.422 --> 01:07:09.157
Are there any questions
I can answer for you today...

01:07:09.159 --> 01:07:11.393
About your personal
or sexual health?

01:07:13.562 --> 01:07:17.232
Lila, is there a reason
you came in today...

01:07:17.234 --> 01:07:20.368
For emergency contraception?

01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:23.038
I think the nurse made a mistake.

01:07:43.292 --> 01:07:47.062
<i>You've reached the offices of the
president of the United States.</i>

01:07:47.064 --> 01:07:49.130
<i>No, I'm playing.</i>
<i>This is Sammy.</i>

01:07:49.132 --> 01:07:52.600
<i>If I call you back, I call you.
If I don't, then, oh well.</i>

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:05.640
What are you doing here?

01:09:05.642 --> 01:09:08.609
What do you think she's doing here?

01:09:08.612 --> 01:09:11.912
Your mom let me in.

01:09:11.915 --> 01:09:13.716
I think she's here 'cause
she wants your dick.

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:18.786
She can suck my dick.

01:09:18.787 --> 01:09:20.688
You never shower.
She don't want...

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:22.423
Your smelly little stinky dick.

01:09:22.425 --> 01:09:26.528
I think she wants to
suck all our dicks.

01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:31.399
She only likes to pretend
to suck your dick.

01:09:36.872 --> 01:09:38.872
I'll do it.

01:09:55.525 --> 01:09:58.660
It's gonna be a little hard
to do standing up.

01:09:58.662 --> 01:10:01.496
Go on.

01:10:01.498 --> 01:10:04.832
Come on, puppy, sit. Sit.

01:10:15.411 --> 01:10:17.946
Did you decide
who you're gonna do first?

01:10:22.685 --> 01:10:24.886
Pick me.

01:11:20.743 --> 01:11:23.711
Do you like it?

01:11:25.681 --> 01:11:27.649
Do you like it?

01:11:30.886 --> 01:11:34.022
Do you like my dick?

01:11:39.995 --> 01:11:42.463
It doesn't like you.

01:12:34.883 --> 01:12:36.617
What do you want?

01:12:41.457 --> 01:12:43.658
What's wrong?

01:12:52.935 --> 01:12:55.770
Oh, come on.
What's wrong?

01:13:00.976 --> 01:13:03.611
