WEBVTT

00:01.301 --> 00:03.502
<i>Thanks for
downloading this fox show.</i>

00:03.504 --> 00:05.738
<i>And don't miss
all-new episodes on fox.</i>

00:05.939 --> 00:11.010
<i>Previously on sleepy hollow... Dreyfuss
won't rest until he's gotten the gun.</i>

00:11.012 --> 00:12.544
It raises the horseman of war.

00:12.546 --> 00:14.213
How about a name? It's Lara.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.114
Despair's webbing...
That's how Henry

00:16.117 --> 00:18.283
was created inside crane's mind.

00:18.285 --> 00:20.019
<i>Dreyfuss
isn't acting like someone</i>

00:20.021 --> 00:22.221
<i>looking to burn the world
to a cinder.</i>

00:22.223 --> 00:24.223
Maybe he's got other plans.
I am destined

00:24.225 --> 00:26.458
<i>to become the best thing</i>

00:26.460 --> 00:28.394
<i>that has ever happened
to America.</i>

00:28.396 --> 00:30.062
Four totems, four riders.

00:30.064 --> 00:31.730
And we're just outside
of camp David.

00:31.732 --> 00:32.998
Dreyfuss is raising the horseman

00:33.000 --> 00:34.400
to take out our
commander in chief.

00:34.402 --> 00:35.634
<i>You seem to know a lot</i>

00:35.636 --> 00:36.635
<i>about Malcolm dreyfuss</i>

00:36.637 --> 00:37.903
<i>and his plans.</i>

00:37.905 --> 00:39.738
She is from the future.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.907
Molly?
Yesterday was the last day

00:41.909 --> 00:43.809
that I remember
seeing you alive.

00:43.811 --> 00:45.711
<i>When dreyfuss fires that gun,</i>

00:45.713 --> 00:47.679
it will be
a disaster like no other.

00:55.990 --> 00:57.589
<i>A long time ago,</i>

00:57.591 --> 00:59.058
<i>there was a land called</i>

00:59.060 --> 01:00.993
America.

01:00.995 --> 01:03.062
Where food was aplenty,

01:03.064 --> 01:04.730
people were free,

01:04.732 --> 01:06.899
and there was more TV
than you could ever imagine.

01:06.901 --> 01:08.934
Seriously.

01:08.936 --> 01:10.202
You could watch anything.

01:10.204 --> 01:12.271
Even shows about cupcake wars.

01:12.273 --> 01:13.439
But...

01:13.441 --> 01:16.608
Then along came the dreyfuss.

01:16.610 --> 01:19.111
Boo!

01:19.113 --> 01:20.879
He took the power
from the people

01:20.881 --> 01:23.048
and he kept it all for himself.

01:23.050 --> 01:25.451
The world you grew up in
was one he created.

01:25.453 --> 01:28.053
America was no longer America.

01:28.055 --> 01:29.288
But there were those
who fought back.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.290
Brave people like

01:31.292 --> 01:32.458
your moms and dads,

01:32.460 --> 01:34.359
who refuse to accept
the darkness,

01:34.361 --> 01:36.962
have been fighting for years
for freedom.

01:36.964 --> 01:38.931
To bring down the dreyfuss.

01:38.933 --> 01:41.033
I heard if you chop
the dreyfuss' arm off,

01:41.035 --> 01:42.868
he grows another arm.

01:42.870 --> 01:46.572
My brother says if you look
directly at him, your eyes melt.

01:48.042 --> 01:50.075
I'm sure you've all
heard lots of stories,

01:50.077 --> 01:52.377
but he is just a man.

01:52.379 --> 01:54.980
One who can
and will be defeated.

01:56.916 --> 01:59.818
Now, I want to thank you all
for these lovely pictures.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.453
And remember, we don't
talk about this class

02:01.455 --> 02:02.821
with anyone, right?

02:02.823 --> 02:04.123
Yes. Because if we

02:04.125 --> 02:05.724
talk about freedom...

02:05.726 --> 02:07.826
The riders will come.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.026
Very good.

02:12.298 --> 02:13.499
We have a code black.

02:13.501 --> 02:15.334
How long?

02:15.336 --> 02:16.668
Five, six minutes out.

02:19.072 --> 02:21.673
Okay, children,
that's all for today.

02:21.675 --> 02:24.109
Find your safety buddies
and head to the common area.

02:24.111 --> 02:27.412
Your parents will
meet you there. Bye.

02:28.516 --> 02:29.915
Which one is it?

02:29.917 --> 02:32.818
It's all of them.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.586
Damn.

02:41.995 --> 02:45.864
Tell Julian priority
is getting everyone to safety.

02:48.501 --> 02:50.402
Go.

02:54.641 --> 02:56.508
Let's hope you're as good
as advertised.

03:29.475 --> 03:30.742
Fire!

03:39.352 --> 03:41.253
Aah!

03:52.700 --> 03:54.032
Fall back!

03:54.034 --> 03:55.234
Fall back!

03:55.236 --> 03:57.569
Run!

04:07.614 --> 04:09.414
Come on.

04:28.868 --> 04:30.202
Molly.

04:30.204 --> 04:31.970
Don't call me that.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.805
I'm not calling you by the name

04:33.807 --> 04:35.240
dreyfuss gave you.

04:35.242 --> 04:37.242
He gave me more than a name.

04:37.244 --> 04:38.977
He gave me a life.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.879
One based on lies.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.247
You have to know that.

04:42.249 --> 04:44.416
What I know is I
finally caught you.

04:44.418 --> 04:46.585
Malcolm wanted your execution

04:46.587 --> 04:48.754
to be public to show everyone

04:48.756 --> 04:50.656
what we do to terrorists.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.658
So you're gonna kill me?

04:54.794 --> 04:56.628
I don't think you can.

04:56.630 --> 04:59.631
You know that this is wrong.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.667
You should be fighting dreyfuss

05:01.669 --> 05:03.835
for turning your mother
into this.

05:03.837 --> 05:05.304
My mother is dead.

05:05.306 --> 05:08.006
And your attempts at
mind games are pathetic.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.308
I'm not lying.

05:10.343 --> 05:12.110
Ask crane. Crane...

05:12.112 --> 05:13.245
Who's long dead.

05:13.247 --> 05:14.546
You sure about that?

05:16.282 --> 05:17.916
Everything you have been told
is a lie.

05:17.918 --> 05:20.085
Molly, lis...

05:20.087 --> 05:22.754
I told you not to call me that!
It's your name! It's who you are.

05:22.756 --> 05:25.257
Who I am? Do you
want to know who I am?

05:25.259 --> 05:27.759
I'm the girl who lost her mother
because of you and crane.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.695
The teenager who
Malcolm dreyfuss saved

05:29.697 --> 05:31.330
from a life of misery.

05:31.332 --> 05:32.998
The woman who's
going to make sure

05:33.000 --> 05:34.933
that nobody else gets hurt

05:34.935 --> 05:36.501
the way that you hurt me.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.670
And I'm the one
who'll make you pay.

05:50.883 --> 05:52.284
Diana.

05:52.286 --> 05:53.518
I'm sorry.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.587
I failed.

06:08.401 --> 06:10.769
No. No, it can't be.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.143
<i>This is Delilah's dagger.</i>

06:18.145 --> 06:19.911
Legend has it this blade

06:19.913 --> 06:22.581
can cut through any substance.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.316
Even a horseman's armor.

06:24.318 --> 06:28.487
We're lucky she wasn't able
to do more harm with it.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.021
Malcolm, I... I saw something.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.423
Yeah?

06:31.425 --> 06:33.392
Jenny told me something
crazy about war.

06:35.027 --> 06:38.029
She that said war
was actually...

06:38.031 --> 06:39.664
Lara.

06:39.666 --> 06:40.999
Jenny mills...

06:41.001 --> 06:43.902
She was just a creature
of dark times.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.838
Someone who was desperate enough

06:46.840 --> 06:48.206
to say anything.

06:48.208 --> 06:50.108
About me, about you,

06:50.110 --> 06:52.210
and... even about your mother.

06:52.212 --> 06:55.313
I-I never said that
she mentioned my mother.

06:57.617 --> 06:59.551
Well...

06:59.553 --> 07:02.053
If you didn't, trust me...

07:02.055 --> 07:04.589
I've heard that lie
many times before.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.526
Many times.

07:12.565 --> 07:15.133
Malcolm, you emptied
the prisons, right?

07:15.135 --> 07:18.103
After executing crane and
the other political prisoners?

07:19.439 --> 07:21.440
My dear, you've got to stop

07:21.442 --> 07:24.476
letting these whispers
get to you.

07:24.478 --> 07:26.178
Please.

07:28.548 --> 07:30.148
I'm sorry, Malcolm.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.550
It's okay.

07:31.552 --> 07:33.819
Don't you worry. Come here.

07:33.821 --> 07:36.621
Yeah. That's all right.

07:36.623 --> 07:40.158
Hey, if I can't be here
to ease your mind,

07:40.160 --> 07:42.060
then what good am I, right?

07:45.164 --> 07:47.566
<i>Hello?</i>

07:47.568 --> 07:49.901
Anybody here?

07:55.408 --> 07:57.476
Hello?

08:00.847 --> 08:02.747
You're dead.

08:04.917 --> 08:06.318
You're supposed to be dead.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.986
Molly.

08:07.988 --> 08:11.156
Don't... don't call me that.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.024
No.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.660
He changed your name.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.496
You mustn't let him.

08:17.498 --> 08:20.031
Don't let him... don't let him
take your history.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.666
Your family, your... My mother...

08:21.668 --> 08:23.335
What happened to her?

08:23.337 --> 08:26.838
Dreyfuss transformed her
into the horseman of war.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.840
But you know this, don't you?

08:35.214 --> 08:37.349
All this time...

08:37.351 --> 08:38.683
It's all been a lie.

08:38.684 --> 08:39.985
Molly...

08:39.986 --> 08:42.053
All of it.

08:43.389 --> 08:45.657
I am happy to see you well.

08:45.659 --> 08:48.827
Not sure how well I am
right now.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.395
What did he tell you?

08:50.397 --> 08:52.297
He told me that you believed

08:52.299 --> 08:53.465
I was special,

08:53.467 --> 08:55.333
while my mother
wanted to protect me...

08:55.335 --> 08:57.569
Yes, you-you are special.
And your mother did want

08:57.571 --> 08:59.037
to protect you,
she wanted it very much.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.705
We all did.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.807
We wanted to help you,
we wanted to help you...

09:02.809 --> 09:05.143
Grow as a witness.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.345
There is no such thing.

09:07.347 --> 09:10.048
No, now, that
is dreyfuss speaking.

09:10.050 --> 09:13.051
We are the witnesses.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.921
Why do you think
he's kept me in here,

09:15.923 --> 09:18.857
locked up, for years?

09:18.859 --> 09:21.259
It is because he wants to know
that he has control

09:21.261 --> 09:22.727
of the both of us.

09:28.167 --> 09:29.768
I need to get you out of here.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.703
No. W... we can, we can run.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.872
We can hide up north.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.874
There is nowhere on earth
where the horsemen

09:35.876 --> 09:37.175
will not find me.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.711
No, no, no, no,
I have to make this right.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.179
There is another way.

09:41.181 --> 09:44.082
Everything hinges on the moment
dreyfuss shot your mother.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.418
If we stop that from happening,
we can prevent this world

09:46.420 --> 09:49.087
from ever existing. What do you, what
do you mean, stop this from happening?

09:49.089 --> 09:51.856
A very long time ago, my wife

09:51.858 --> 09:54.793
Katrina attempted
to change history

09:54.795 --> 09:56.861
by jumping back into the past

09:56.863 --> 10:00.098
using a powerful invocation

10:00.100 --> 10:02.200
known as the traveler spell.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.802
The traveler spell.

10:06.105 --> 10:09.808
It can be located in an
ancient volume of black magic

10:09.810 --> 10:11.209
known as the grand grimoire.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.211
Here. Molly.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.146
Find it...

10:15.148 --> 10:17.549
And you can save us all.

10:17.551 --> 10:19.751
But to do so...

10:19.753 --> 10:20.986
You must save your mother.

10:23.155 --> 10:25.190
Go, go, go, go.

10:58.924 --> 11:00.358
Lara!

11:01.160 --> 11:03.928
Please...

11:03.930 --> 11:05.363
Don't do this.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.532
I know the truth, Malcolm.

11:08.668 --> 11:09.801
I know what you did.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.603
What-what did I do? I...

11:11.605 --> 11:13.672
I rescued you from darkness,
Lara.

11:13.674 --> 11:15.306
I gave you a life of privilege.

11:15.308 --> 11:18.043
You took my mother from me!

11:18.045 --> 11:20.311
Lara...

11:20.313 --> 11:21.846
No.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.849
No, that wasn't me.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.685
That was fate.

11:27.386 --> 11:28.653
Some things

11:28.655 --> 11:30.388
really are

11:30.390 --> 11:32.290
just meant to be.

11:33.325 --> 11:35.060
So even if you go back,

11:35.062 --> 11:38.797
you won't be able
to change anything.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.965
We'll see about that.

11:40.967 --> 11:42.400
Lara!

11:44.805 --> 11:47.205
<i>When dreyfuss creates
the horseman of war,</i>

11:47.207 --> 11:48.406
<i>it's the beginning of the end.</i>

11:48.408 --> 11:51.376
Malcolm,

11:51.378 --> 11:52.877
you don't have to do this.

11:55.414 --> 11:56.414
Mom!

11:58.652 --> 12:00.285
I did it.

12:01.654 --> 12:02.887
I saved you.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.424
Agent thom... No.

12:06.426 --> 12:07.859
My god.

12:07.861 --> 12:11.563
Well, I did not see that coming.

12:11.565 --> 12:15.233
I can feel it.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.368
The blood.

12:17.370 --> 12:20.004
The fear.

12:20.006 --> 12:21.773
I...

12:21.775 --> 12:25.777
Am become...

12:25.779 --> 12:27.312
War.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.093
But you know what?

12:42.095 --> 12:44.329
I think we can work with that.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.103
War,

13:25.105 --> 13:28.006
what is it good for?

13:28.008 --> 13:30.842
Absolutely everything.

13:30.844 --> 13:34.245
I truly did not want
this to happen. I mean,

13:34.247 --> 13:37.015
I had big plans for crane.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.616
But I guess
you got to learn to roll

13:38.618 --> 13:40.952
with the unexpected
in life, right?

13:40.954 --> 13:43.521
Bring him back.
Bring back crane.

13:43.523 --> 13:46.090
It's kind of a one-way ticket.

13:46.092 --> 13:47.926
Yeah. I mean, that's-that's why

13:47.928 --> 13:49.694
my plan was to shoot you.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.596
Forgive me, but
you're expendable.

13:52.631 --> 13:55.533
You, on the other hand...

13:55.535 --> 13:57.335
I could really use someone
like you.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.871
Actually,

13:59.873 --> 14:01.306
sounds like I already
have. Or I will

14:01.308 --> 14:04.309
one day come to use you. Right?

14:04.311 --> 14:07.979
Boy, time travel sure
complicates verb tenses,

14:07.981 --> 14:08.980
doesn't it?

14:08.982 --> 14:10.315
I'll make it simple:

14:10.317 --> 14:11.950
Screw you.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.885
I knew there was a reason
I liked you.

14:13.887 --> 14:16.020
Well, I got a funny
feeling I'll be...

14:16.022 --> 14:17.956
Seeing you again sooner
or later.

14:17.958 --> 14:22.527
Would you be so kind as to...

14:22.529 --> 14:24.028
Kill them, please?

14:25.965 --> 14:27.031
Crane...

14:28.334 --> 14:29.934
you can fight this.

14:43.749 --> 14:44.983
We need to go!

14:59.331 --> 15:01.332
I think we're okay.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.571
What are you doing?
Just hold on a second.

15:08.007 --> 15:09.774
<i>Mom? Thank god.</i>

15:09.776 --> 15:10.775
You okay?

15:10.777 --> 15:12.076
<i>Yeah, why wouldn't I be?</i>

15:12.078 --> 15:14.712
I'll explain later.
Just... nothing weird

15:14.714 --> 15:16.714
<i>has happened, right?
Well, I mean,</i>

15:16.716 --> 15:18.750
Evie tried to stuff
20 marshmallows in her mouth

15:18.752 --> 15:20.785
<i>and maddie showed us
her double-jointed elbow.</i>

15:20.787 --> 15:22.420
<i>But other than that, no.</i>

15:22.422 --> 15:24.555
Okay. Honey, I'm just gonna come
get you, all right?

15:24.557 --> 15:25.556
<i>Now? Yes.</i>

15:25.558 --> 15:26.891
Right now, yes. No.

15:26.893 --> 15:28.726
<i>I mean, we're about
to make French toast.</i>

15:28.728 --> 15:31.095
Honey, I'll call you back, okay?
Just do not go anywhere.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.764
<i>Okay. Bye. What?</i>

15:32.766 --> 15:35.400
The safest thing for her is to
stay where she is, away from us.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.902
Are you kidding? You said
that dreyfuss is gonna take her.

15:37.904 --> 15:40.071
Not for years. He wanted to make
sure I knew what misery was

15:40.073 --> 15:42.140
before arriving
to save me from it.

15:42.142 --> 15:44.709
And after you...
After you went away,

15:44.711 --> 15:46.945
they tried looking for dad.
Mitch.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.813
And he was reported
missing in action,

15:48.815 --> 15:49.981
so I got shuffled around
in the system.

15:49.983 --> 15:50.982
Malcolm found me there.

15:50.984 --> 15:52.984
I cannot understand this.

15:52.986 --> 15:54.986
I can't.

15:54.988 --> 15:57.488
You're Molly,
but you're not my Molly?

15:57.490 --> 15:59.958
I am Molly,
just from another time.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.493
And now that I've come back
and changed everything,

16:02.495 --> 16:03.995
the young girl
who is your daughter

16:03.997 --> 16:05.964
will have
a completely different future.

16:05.966 --> 16:08.933
We'll always be
two different people.

16:08.935 --> 16:12.303
I just... I don't know
what kind of future it'll be.

16:12.305 --> 16:15.506
Crane,
he wasn't meant to be shot.

16:15.508 --> 16:18.977
Meaning what, that dreyfuss
might still take over the world?

16:18.979 --> 16:21.679
I-I don't know. Well, if we save
crane, then maybe it'll stop dreyfuss.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.082
Yeah, maybe. But then what if
dreyfuss still goes after Molly?

16:24.084 --> 16:25.350
I don't... I don't know,
I don't know.

16:25.352 --> 16:26.851
Okay? None of this
should have happened.

16:26.853 --> 16:29.520
And nothing that I remember
will happen anymore.

16:29.522 --> 16:32.323
I don't know what's
to come in the future.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.193
Welcome to the club.

16:37.162 --> 16:38.529
We got your message.

16:38.531 --> 16:41.599
We've already started
researching how to save crane.

16:45.337 --> 16:48.206
So this is really...

16:48.208 --> 16:50.141
Not-so-little Molly.

16:50.143 --> 16:52.710
Lara. No one's
called me Molly in years.

16:52.712 --> 16:56.047
Years. As in years from now.

16:56.049 --> 16:59.050
And I thought, crane's
time travel act was trippy.

16:59.052 --> 17:00.785
Save the questions for later.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.353
What'd you find? Not much.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.188
There's practically
no literature

17:04.190 --> 17:06.057
on how to save someone
who's become a horseman.

17:06.059 --> 17:07.125
Because it's not possible.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.126
I saw a piece

17:08.127 --> 17:09.660
of what was inside war,

17:09.662 --> 17:12.163
and what was left wasn't human.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.598
I don't believe that.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.134
Crane's blood.

17:16.136 --> 17:17.868
What?

17:17.871 --> 17:19.237
That means he's still flesh
and blood in there.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.372
Okay. This means we
can still save him.

17:21.374 --> 17:24.008
What about dreyfuss?
If anybody knows about this kind

17:24.010 --> 17:25.877
of transformation, it's him.
Yeah, probably,

17:25.878 --> 17:27.345
but there's no way to
get close to him now.

17:27.347 --> 17:28.880
His security is on high alert.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.882
We barely escaped
from that compound alive.

17:30.884 --> 17:31.883
Compound?

17:31.885 --> 17:32.917
Yeah, outside of camp David.

17:32.919 --> 17:34.052
We got pictures.

17:38.390 --> 17:42.460
They were taken outside
of catoctin state park.

17:43.429 --> 17:44.662
Here.

17:47.566 --> 17:48.566
This is bad.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.034
Dreyfuss has the horsemen

17:50.036 --> 17:51.836
in striking distance
of the president.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.538
Look, they're not
the fab four yet.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.039
We saw the coffins, okay?

17:55.041 --> 17:56.541
The one for death is still open.

17:56.543 --> 17:57.942
No doubt dreyfuss
is working on filling

17:57.944 --> 17:59.644
that vacancy very soon.

18:01.680 --> 18:04.682
I've located the rune we need
to recharge death's totem.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.918
It was shielded from my senses.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.520
But nothing stays hidden
forever.

18:09.522 --> 18:12.056
Not from me.

18:12.058 --> 18:15.860
I love it when you get
all ominous like that.

18:15.862 --> 18:17.929
Gives me the best kind
of chills.

18:19.232 --> 18:22.567
And right on cue.

18:22.569 --> 18:25.269
Ho, ho, ho.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.771
What happened here?

18:26.773 --> 18:28.773
They actually
managed to hurt you?

18:28.775 --> 18:30.975
Unlike our other hosts, crane

18:30.977 --> 18:32.577
didn't have the
opportunity to fully bond

18:32.579 --> 18:33.978
with the avatar of war.

18:33.980 --> 18:36.781
A short regenerative
period should restore him.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.823
By the time I return...

18:47.960 --> 18:50.128
he should be at full strength.

18:50.130 --> 18:51.963
Well, what are you
standing here for?

18:53.065 --> 18:56.300
Go get me my last horseman.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.977
First things first,
we save crane.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.912
That'll also deny dreyfuss
one of the horsemen.

19:07.914 --> 19:10.781
But we don't know where crane is.
Or much less how to save him.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.016
And I'm telling you again,
you don't want to

19:12.018 --> 19:13.451
mess with the dark riders.

19:16.156 --> 19:18.289
That's banneker's security
system; It means that there's

19:18.291 --> 19:20.124
a supernatural
threat in the vault.

19:20.126 --> 19:21.325
Just spread out, be careful.

19:37.843 --> 19:38.943
I'm sorry,

19:38.945 --> 19:41.512
am I interrupting?

19:49.154 --> 19:50.454
It's remarkable.

19:50.456 --> 19:52.390
A bit of my soul

19:52.392 --> 19:54.058
trapped in a creature's

19:54.060 --> 19:56.627
foul humors,

19:56.629 --> 19:58.896
mingles with the blood of war,

19:58.898 --> 20:01.065
and I am whole again.

20:01.067 --> 20:04.135
What a serendipitous conception.

20:04.137 --> 20:07.572
But I suppose all birth
is a miracle.

20:07.574 --> 20:10.474
I-I mean you no harm.

20:12.177 --> 20:13.978
I-I was conceived

20:13.980 --> 20:16.981
out of ichabod crane's
memories, and as such,

20:16.983 --> 20:20.251
I am the son
he chose to remember.

20:20.253 --> 20:22.053
That's funny.

20:22.055 --> 20:24.255
The Henry Parrish I remember
was a real bastard.

20:24.257 --> 20:27.158
Yes, I-i had my share of demons,

20:27.160 --> 20:29.360
both literally and figuratively.

20:29.362 --> 20:32.029
This is crane's son?

20:32.031 --> 20:33.531
He's kind of old.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.266
Tell that to your grown
daughter over there.

20:35.268 --> 20:37.168
Point taken.

20:37.170 --> 20:39.737
Your colleagues have been
gone for some time.

20:39.739 --> 20:40.838
You sure they're all right?

20:40.840 --> 20:42.240
They're resetting
the security system

20:42.242 --> 20:43.841
so we can get out of here.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.810
Maybe not all of us.

20:47.179 --> 20:49.580
Out of curiosity,
how did you come to find

20:49.582 --> 20:51.882
the horseman of war's blood?

20:51.884 --> 20:53.317
It's crane's blood.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.054
Only the essence of war

20:57.056 --> 20:59.757
should've been able
to rouse my spirit,

20:59.759 --> 21:02.260
given that I once wore
the horseman's mantle.

21:02.262 --> 21:03.628
So I don't...

21:06.064 --> 21:10.134
Ichabod has become
the horseman of war, hasn't he?

21:13.773 --> 21:15.906
Like father, like son.

21:15.908 --> 21:18.709
Or is it the other way around?

21:18.711 --> 21:20.211
Is this guy telling the truth?

21:20.213 --> 21:21.612
He was the horseman of war?

21:21.614 --> 21:23.447
Long story, but yeah.

21:23.449 --> 21:24.982
Okay, so that means that
we can bring people back

21:24.984 --> 21:26.417
if they've been turned.

21:26.419 --> 21:28.819
Trust me, we can't do it
like we did it with him.

21:28.821 --> 21:30.154
There is another way.

21:30.156 --> 21:33.624
I know of a-a
decoupling ceremony.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.159
It was going to be performed

21:35.161 --> 21:37.628
by a powerful witch

21:37.630 --> 21:40.631
to release the human soul
from the horseman of death.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.233
Katrina.

21:42.235 --> 21:44.135
Crane's wife? Yes.

21:44.137 --> 21:45.836
She wanted to release
Abraham Van brunt

21:45.838 --> 21:48.339
from the headless horseman, but
she died before she could try.

21:48.341 --> 21:51.142
No, Malcolm cornered
the market on all spellbooks,

21:51.144 --> 21:53.511
and if such a thing existed, it
would've been in his collection.

21:53.513 --> 21:55.146
I've never seen, never heard

21:55.148 --> 21:56.247
of such a ritual.

21:56.249 --> 21:58.149
No, you wouldn't have found it.

21:58.151 --> 21:59.850
Crane kept all of Katrina's

21:59.852 --> 22:01.152
possessions back at
their old place

22:01.154 --> 22:02.853
in sleepy hollow.

22:02.855 --> 22:04.922
How did I know that we were
gonna get dragged back there

22:04.924 --> 22:06.524
- one way or another?
- Wait, you're gonna

22:06.526 --> 22:08.659
believe the man who was a jar
of goo five minutes ago?

22:11.330 --> 22:13.764
<i>Okay, we're about
to raise the barriers.</i>

22:13.766 --> 22:15.066
<i>Stand back!</i>

22:17.202 --> 22:21.172
Unless anyone has any better
ideas than the jar of goo?

22:27.814 --> 22:31.148
A masonic cell? Is this place
strong enough to hold him?

22:31.150 --> 22:33.384
We held the horseman of death
in here once.

22:33.386 --> 22:36.687
Should be strong enough.

22:36.689 --> 22:39.190
Okay, got it. We'll be right up.
That was Alex and Jake.

22:39.192 --> 22:41.625
They need us in the archives
right away. They've got

22:41.627 --> 22:43.394
something they need us to see.

22:43.396 --> 22:44.829
Perhaps I could be
of more assistance?

22:44.831 --> 22:47.298
I think we've got it
under control.

22:47.300 --> 22:50.835
It's just that I would like
to do more for my father.

22:50.837 --> 22:53.170
Shakespeare said, "it is a wise"

22:53.172 --> 22:55.806
father that knows
his own child."

22:55.808 --> 22:58.809
In my case, the wisdom had
to come to the child, as well.

22:58.811 --> 23:02.847
Your track record
as the good son is a bit spotty.

23:02.849 --> 23:05.716
I-I don't fault you

23:05.718 --> 23:08.085
for being cautious, Jenny mills.

23:08.087 --> 23:09.687
Just know

23:09.689 --> 23:11.722
that I have been reborn...

23:11.724 --> 23:13.758
In a very literal sense.

23:13.760 --> 23:17.061
I'd like to believe that, Henry,
but I just can't.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.896
Not yet.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.865
I understand.

23:20.867 --> 23:23.834
Not all reawakening is welcome.

23:25.771 --> 23:28.939
At this moment,
the avatar of war

23:28.941 --> 23:33.511
is breaking my father's
psyche down, bit by bit,

23:33.513 --> 23:35.746
and soon
there will be nothing left

23:35.748 --> 23:38.115
of the man known
as ichabod crane.

23:38.117 --> 23:40.751
You must reach him
before that happens.

23:40.753 --> 23:41.886
Save him.

23:41.888 --> 23:43.754
For that is a rebirth

23:43.756 --> 23:46.724
no one wants to see.

23:46.726 --> 23:50.194
It's a question of which Henry
we're dealing with,

23:50.196 --> 23:52.696
because if it's the bad Henry,
then he can cause...

23:55.467 --> 23:56.801
a lot of damage.

23:56.803 --> 23:58.469
We found it like this.

23:58.471 --> 24:00.237
Either the archives
has a serious

24:00.239 --> 24:01.806
raccoon problem...

24:01.808 --> 24:03.240
Or someone pulled
an old smash-and-grab.

24:03.242 --> 24:04.875
You should see this.

24:04.877 --> 24:06.877
No.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.285
Spare jewelry?

24:14.287 --> 24:16.253
Something slightly
more valuable.

24:16.255 --> 24:19.123
The most dangerous magical
items in our possession.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.625
This is still fresh.
We have a chance of catching up

24:21.627 --> 24:23.260
to whoever did this
if we act fast.

24:23.262 --> 24:25.963
Yeah, it would help
if we knew what was taken.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.832
Well, knowing our track
record, I'm guessing

24:27.834 --> 24:29.600
it's something that'll give
your nightmares nightmares.

24:29.602 --> 24:30.734
I can figure out what it is,

24:30.736 --> 24:32.336
but it's gonna take time
and crane.

24:32.338 --> 24:34.238
Divide and conquer.
You guys work on this,

24:34.240 --> 24:36.106
I'll get the spellbook.
You said it was in a cabin?

24:36.108 --> 24:37.908
Yeah, Corbin's cabin.
It's where crane used to live.

24:37.910 --> 24:39.777
Look, no offense,

24:39.779 --> 24:41.612
but your magical know-how
isn't exactly state-of-the-art.

24:41.614 --> 24:43.581
You could end up grabbing
her recipe collection.

24:43.583 --> 24:45.282
I'll go with her.

24:45.284 --> 24:47.184
I know my way around spellbooks.

24:47.186 --> 24:49.587
You good with that?

24:51.123 --> 24:53.424
Think I can handle it.

25:01.867 --> 25:03.534
You still draw?

25:04.803 --> 25:06.804
Not much.

25:06.806 --> 25:08.639
What about soccer?

25:08.641 --> 25:10.774
Look, I can tell you right now,
my life didn't turn out

25:10.776 --> 25:12.343
anything like
you thought it would.

25:13.512 --> 25:16.080
You're angry with me.

25:17.883 --> 25:20.451
I was, for a long time.

25:20.453 --> 25:23.954
I remember learning
you were dead, and feeling numb,

25:23.956 --> 25:27.958
and then angry,
and then miserable.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.895
You and crane had told me
how I was special,

25:30.897 --> 25:33.464
and how I would never be alone.

25:33.466 --> 25:35.499
But I was alone,

25:35.501 --> 25:37.301
and that made me angry again.

25:37.303 --> 25:39.970
And that's when
dreyfuss came to you?

25:39.972 --> 25:42.473
Yeah.

25:42.475 --> 25:44.308
He was kind.

25:45.477 --> 25:48.078
He-he was my father.
No, come on.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.981
That's the way that I saw it.

25:50.983 --> 25:54.919
That's why I told myself
that the things that I did

25:54.921 --> 25:56.854
for him were okay,
but now that I'm here,

25:56.856 --> 26:00.925
telling you about all the evil
that I've done...

26:01.994 --> 26:04.161
I know this isn't the life
you wanted for me.

26:04.163 --> 26:06.330
Hey, listen,

26:06.332 --> 26:10.701
the only thing that matters
is that you survived.

26:10.703 --> 26:12.870
If there's anything I've learned
from my time with crane,

26:12.872 --> 26:15.539
it's that you do not know what's
coming around that corner.

26:15.541 --> 26:17.608
Think you have it all
under control, and then,

26:17.610 --> 26:19.910
one day,
a 250-year-old British guy

26:19.912 --> 26:21.946
shows up and tells you
that your little daughter is

26:21.948 --> 26:24.114
a biblically-prophesied witness.

26:25.884 --> 26:29.787
Malcolm told me the witnesses
was just some story that you...

26:29.789 --> 26:32.056
No, it's not.

26:32.058 --> 26:34.124
It's what you are.

26:36.361 --> 26:37.861
You should know that

26:37.863 --> 26:40.397
by me coming here,
the future has been rewritten.

26:40.399 --> 26:44.134
No matter what happens,
Molly... your Molly...

26:44.136 --> 26:46.770
She won't end up like me.

26:49.407 --> 26:51.976
Thank you for giving her back
her future.

26:51.978 --> 26:55.245
Let's hope it's a future
worth having.

26:55.247 --> 26:57.281
Thracian phial,

26:57.283 --> 27:00.451
jincan venom,

27:00.453 --> 27:03.153
the egg of asag.

27:03.155 --> 27:05.756
So that just leaves...

27:05.758 --> 27:08.559
Damn.

27:09.060 --> 27:10.461
What is it?

27:10.463 --> 27:12.630
The draugur stone.

27:12.632 --> 27:16.467
A norse artifact
that can raise the undead.

27:16.469 --> 27:19.637
Undead? Kind of like zombies?

27:24.509 --> 27:26.510
Exactly like zombies.

27:26.512 --> 27:28.345
What'd I tell you? Nightmares.

27:30.915 --> 27:32.683
I've seen a drawing
of this before.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.820
At dreyfuss' cabin.

27:36.822 --> 27:38.789
He must have sent his
demonic gofer to retrieve it.

27:38.791 --> 27:40.290
So in addition to everything,

27:40.292 --> 27:42.860
dreyfuss can now harness
the power of the undead.

27:42.862 --> 27:44.928
Harness.

27:45.764 --> 27:47.531
That's what he's doing.

27:47.533 --> 27:49.867
<i>Dreyfuss is charging up
artifacts</i>

27:49.869 --> 27:51.802
<i>to raise the horsemen.</i>

27:51.804 --> 27:55.139
<i>The final totem left
is death's axe.</i>

27:55.141 --> 27:56.840
<i>What if dreyfuss wants
to harness</i>

27:56.842 --> 27:58.108
<i>the power of the undead
to charge the axe?</i>

27:58.110 --> 27:59.977
<i>A charged axe</i>

27:59.979 --> 28:02.513
<i>would allow him to revive
the horseman of death.</i>

28:02.515 --> 28:04.615
He would need to raise
bodies with strong

28:04.617 --> 28:06.183
spiritual ties to the horseman.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.619
Family, relatives.

28:08.621 --> 28:10.320
Followers.

28:10.322 --> 28:13.891
The horseman used to command
an elite group of hessians,

28:13.893 --> 28:16.827
<i>mercenaries whose
devotion to him</i>

28:16.829 --> 28:18.595
<i>bordered on fanatical.</i>

28:20.131 --> 28:21.398
Where might these hessians be?

28:21.400 --> 28:23.400
They all drowned

28:23.402 --> 28:25.202
when Washington sank their boat
in the Hudson.

28:34.646 --> 28:38.048
<i>They were on their way
to launch an attack.</i>

28:38.050 --> 28:40.784
An attack on sleepy hollow.

28:53.832 --> 28:55.265
What's a spellbook look like?

28:55.267 --> 28:57.835
A book with spells in it.

28:57.837 --> 29:00.170
Very helpful.

29:06.778 --> 29:09.246
Okay, I think I got something.

29:12.417 --> 29:14.451
Here.

29:18.456 --> 29:20.758
<i>"Incantantio separatio."</i>

29:20.760 --> 29:21.759
Spell for separation.

29:21.761 --> 29:23.093
This must be it.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.095
Problem?

29:25.097 --> 29:26.530
Let me guess.
It's insanely difficult

29:26.532 --> 29:28.899
and requires some
impossible-to-find ingredient,

29:28.901 --> 29:31.435
like tears of a unicorn
or dragon's spleen.

29:31.437 --> 29:33.203
No, it's actually fairly simple.

29:33.205 --> 29:35.639
It's basically just a ritual
to reach into someone's mind

29:35.641 --> 29:37.374
and communicate
with a trapped spirit.

29:37.376 --> 29:38.876
I could do it right here.

29:38.878 --> 29:40.644
The hard part isn't the spell,

29:40.646 --> 29:43.914
it's convincing the imprisoned
soul to come back to our world.

29:43.916 --> 29:45.616
Crane's made it back
from situations like this.

29:45.618 --> 29:46.884
He can do it.

29:46.886 --> 29:49.086
Okay. All I need is,

29:49.088 --> 29:50.988
something that holds a piece
of his essence.

29:50.990 --> 29:54.224
Like a piece of clothing?
A photo?

29:54.226 --> 29:55.492
Or you.

29:55.494 --> 29:56.994
The soul of a loved one

29:56.996 --> 29:58.896
can create a powerful
psychic bridge.

29:59.931 --> 30:02.065
Okay.

30:02.067 --> 30:03.567
What do we do?

30:03.569 --> 30:04.802
Okay, we got to clear a space.

30:07.438 --> 30:08.672
And dragon spleens?

30:09.974 --> 30:11.608
You definitely don't want
to mess with that stuff.

30:11.610 --> 30:13.010
Totally messed up
a friend of mine.

30:13.012 --> 30:14.278
You're joking, right?

30:14.280 --> 30:15.979
Yeah, I am.

30:16.915 --> 30:19.082
You always were easy.

30:31.996 --> 30:36.033
I thank you
for lending me your energies.

30:36.035 --> 30:37.634
Now you are free

30:37.636 --> 30:41.004
to answer
your master's last call.

30:41.006 --> 30:46.677
Will you at last
bring death to sleepy hollow?

30:49.949 --> 30:53.183
<i>So, zombie hessians are
gonna wipe out sleepy hollow?</i>

30:53.185 --> 30:54.852
That's what the undead
usually do:

30:54.854 --> 30:57.487
Try to finish
their unfinished business.

30:57.489 --> 30:58.956
Okay.

30:58.958 --> 31:01.058
Greek fire rounds.

31:01.060 --> 31:03.861
All of the pop of
the unquenchable mystical flame,

31:03.863 --> 31:05.062
but in projectile form.

31:05.064 --> 31:06.897
These should take out
the hessians.

31:06.899 --> 31:09.032
And so, what's the catch?

31:09.034 --> 31:10.267
These are all we've got.

31:11.970 --> 31:14.037
Make every shot count.

31:14.039 --> 31:17.374
Right, so, no pressure at all.

31:17.376 --> 31:18.842
Hey, you've got this.

31:18.844 --> 31:20.811
Trust me,

31:20.813 --> 31:22.579
I've seen what you can do.

31:22.581 --> 31:24.615
That's right, we got this.

31:26.184 --> 31:29.219
Yeah, we'll... just... let's go.

32:02.420 --> 32:03.420
Who are you?

32:03.422 --> 32:04.421
Ichabod crane.

32:04.423 --> 32:05.956
Is this agency 355?

32:05.958 --> 32:07.457
- In a dream.
- Dreams.

32:07.459 --> 32:09.526
I ask if it bothers you,
you just change the subject.

32:09.528 --> 32:11.128
Molly shall know no fear.

32:11.130 --> 32:12.296
That's what we are,

32:12.298 --> 32:13.530
a team.

32:33.718 --> 32:35.452
Crane?

32:39.924 --> 32:41.892
I'm here to get you out.

32:43.628 --> 32:45.095
<i>Get out!</i>

32:45.097 --> 32:47.130
<i>You can't be here!</i>

32:47.132 --> 32:49.199
<i>I'm afraid! He'll come for me.</i>

32:50.468 --> 32:51.635
<i>Go away!</i>

32:55.974 --> 32:58.241
This is some kind
of transformation chamber.

32:58.243 --> 33:02.312
A chrysalis created
inside your psyche,

33:02.314 --> 33:05.415
so all of this has been
constructed in your head.

33:07.518 --> 33:09.419
<i>Get away from here!</i>

33:09.421 --> 33:11.588
<i>What do you want?
He's going to hurt us!</i>

33:11.590 --> 33:14.925
The voices are anger,

33:14.927 --> 33:17.160
disgust, fear.

33:17.162 --> 33:19.096
Primal emotions.

33:19.098 --> 33:21.832
At this moment,
the avatar of war

33:21.834 --> 33:23.367
is breaking my father's

33:23.369 --> 33:26.503
psyche down bit by bit.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.872
You are being deconstructed.

33:28.874 --> 33:30.207
Easier for the horseman

33:30.209 --> 33:32.709
to take over your soul
if you're in pieces.

33:32.711 --> 33:34.711
Okay, so...

33:34.713 --> 33:37.514
How do we put humpty dumpty
back together again?

33:56.869 --> 33:59.136
<i>He's here, he's here...</i>

34:00.371 --> 34:03.273
<i>He's here! He's here!</i>

34:05.410 --> 34:07.711
<i>He's here. He's here.
Yeah, no kidding.</i>

34:10.248 --> 34:11.947
<i>He's here, he's here.</i>

34:15.719 --> 34:17.420
<i>He's here!</i>

34:17.422 --> 34:20.157
So are these zombies
slow or fast?

34:20.159 --> 34:21.525
They ain't slow.

34:21.527 --> 34:23.025
But you beat them before, right?

34:23.027 --> 34:26.029
Yes, barely.

34:31.101 --> 34:32.969
Go, go, go.

34:36.674 --> 34:38.909
Okay, don't engage
until they're close.

34:38.911 --> 34:40.277
Take it one shot at a time.

34:40.279 --> 34:41.678
And remember,

34:41.679 --> 34:43.080
watch each other's backs.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.848
- Okay.
- Ready?

34:46.351 --> 34:48.150
Now!

35:10.141 --> 35:11.408
Is that it?

35:11.410 --> 35:13.543
Did we get them all?

35:17.983 --> 35:19.416
Messin' with the hessians.

35:19.418 --> 35:20.817
Am I right?

35:20.819 --> 35:22.586
Shh.

35:30.728 --> 35:31.995
You had to say something.

35:31.997 --> 35:33.864
Why has there always
got to be a round two?

35:39.770 --> 35:42.906
Crane, the horseman is trying
to make you lose yourself.

35:43.975 --> 35:46.243
Remember who you are.

35:46.245 --> 35:48.879
I remember how you were there
for a confused girl.

35:50.948 --> 35:53.517
I had forgotten,
but not anymore.

35:56.754 --> 35:59.322
<i>I remember you.</i>

35:59.324 --> 36:01.958
You are ichabod crane.

36:04.997 --> 36:06.096
Lara?

36:20.011 --> 36:23.647
There's something else, crane.

36:23.649 --> 36:26.449
Another reason why you can't
let this bastard win.

36:27.885 --> 36:29.886
It's this bond between us.

36:29.888 --> 36:33.723
I tried to forget it,
but it's part of who I am.

36:33.725 --> 36:36.193
I guess I've always known,
even when Malcolm told me

36:36.195 --> 36:37.894
that it wasn't real.

36:40.731 --> 36:43.533
You and I...

36:43.535 --> 36:44.935
We are the witnesses.

36:47.738 --> 36:51.274
Yes, we are.

37:04.922 --> 37:06.489
All right.

37:08.492 --> 37:09.859
All right, all right.

37:09.861 --> 37:11.261
All right, rest here.

37:11.263 --> 37:13.697
Mom always said you had a flair
for the dramatic.

37:13.699 --> 37:16.032
Yes, well, your mother
is incorrigible.

37:18.270 --> 37:20.537
And thanks to you,

37:20.539 --> 37:23.306
I am no longer bound
to the horseman of war.

37:24.909 --> 37:26.576
So why are we still here?

37:26.578 --> 37:28.945
Not that the inside
of your psyche

37:28.947 --> 37:30.280
isn't comfy and all.

37:30.282 --> 37:33.083
Before I fully disengage
from the horseman,

37:33.085 --> 37:36.052
I want to use his power
for one final deed.

37:38.756 --> 37:40.156
All right, all right.

37:41.892 --> 37:44.894
"And if any man will hurt them,

37:44.896 --> 37:48.365
"fire proceedeth
out of their mouths

37:48.367 --> 37:51.268
and devoureth their enemies."

37:51.270 --> 37:53.169
Hey, I remember that.

37:55.706 --> 37:58.041
In the Bible,
about the witnesses.

37:58.043 --> 38:00.710
You-you told me that
at my birthday.

38:00.712 --> 38:02.946
Do you remember what
I told you it meant?

38:02.948 --> 38:05.382
Yeah.

38:05.384 --> 38:08.151
That I'll never be alone.

38:13.458 --> 38:15.659
Are you okay?

38:17.428 --> 38:19.896
I think so.

38:21.399 --> 38:23.099
Crane... did you reach him?

38:23.101 --> 38:26.269
Yes. He's free.

38:26.271 --> 38:29.105
Okay.

38:29.107 --> 38:31.341
And he told me
to tell you something.

38:32.743 --> 38:35.412
He told me that you should
let Molly have

38:35.414 --> 38:37.814
that new cell phone
that she's been asking for.

38:38.849 --> 38:40.450
He did, did he? Yeah.

38:40.452 --> 38:43.353
And those earrings. The big...

38:43.355 --> 38:44.721
Yeah. I know the ones, yeah.

38:53.698 --> 38:55.899
He said he had something
to take care of.

39:01.205 --> 39:04.140
I'm out. Me, too.

39:04.142 --> 39:05.709
Look out.

40:04.168 --> 40:06.069
Crane?

40:06.071 --> 40:08.304
Crane...

40:09.707 --> 40:11.908
Are you all right?

40:11.910 --> 40:13.810
Yes, yes.

40:15.079 --> 40:17.514
I am pleased to see all of you.

40:17.516 --> 40:21.050
Same. Now how the hell
did you do that?

40:21.052 --> 40:24.621
Lara and agent Thomas.

40:24.623 --> 40:26.122
They succeeded in
freeing my spirit

40:26.124 --> 40:28.191
from the clutches
of the horseman.

40:28.193 --> 40:31.461
But before I fully divested
from the avatar,

40:31.463 --> 40:33.863
I took advantage of its power
to come to your aid.

40:33.865 --> 40:36.132
Wait, so instead of the horseman
controlling you,

40:36.134 --> 40:37.867
<i>you were controlling it?</i>

40:37.869 --> 40:40.970
As they say, turnabout is...

40:40.972 --> 40:42.906
Is freaking awesome!

40:42.908 --> 40:44.707
Close enough.

40:44.709 --> 40:45.975
So does this mean war's
gone for good?

40:45.977 --> 40:47.977
I fear not.

40:47.979 --> 40:51.281
I can still faintly
hear its siren call.

40:51.283 --> 40:54.784
Which means it has not left
this earthly plane.

40:54.786 --> 40:56.920
Three guesses who's
going to be trying

40:56.922 --> 40:58.788
to get it back in the game.

40:58.790 --> 41:01.825
Malcolm, there is a problem.

41:01.827 --> 41:04.928
Crane's allies were able
to release him.

41:04.930 --> 41:07.430
He is no longer
the horseman of war.

41:07.432 --> 41:09.232
How, jobe?

41:09.234 --> 41:10.533
Not to fear.

41:11.769 --> 41:13.636
War's spirit was not destroyed,

41:13.638 --> 41:15.472
it was but separated
from crane's.

41:15.474 --> 41:19.843
It can be recalled, provided
you have the right host.

41:19.845 --> 41:22.979
One whose soul has already been
primed to be the horseman.

41:22.981 --> 41:25.715
Perhaps I'll do.

41:29.854 --> 41:32.355
Jobe, what...
Who the hell is this guy?

41:32.357 --> 41:35.625
Malcolm, allow me
to introduce to you

41:35.627 --> 41:37.460
Henry Parrish,

41:37.462 --> 41:39.829
son of ichabod crane,

41:39.831 --> 41:42.265
and former host
to the horseman of war.

41:42.267 --> 41:43.833
"Rightful."

41:43.835 --> 41:46.169
The word he is looking for is

41:46.171 --> 41:50.373
the rightful host for
the horseman of war.

41:50.375 --> 41:52.942
Thank you for freeing me
from those unpleasant quarters.

41:52.944 --> 41:54.711
Don't mention it. Jobe, jobe...

41:54.713 --> 41:56.880
Jobe, jobe.

41:56.882 --> 42:01.050
You seem to be
saying, "hey, Malcolm",

42:01.052 --> 42:03.019
"this random man
out of the woods,

42:03.021 --> 42:04.621
this is crane's son."

42:04.623 --> 42:07.690
As if we've got every
reason in the world

42:07.692 --> 42:10.493
to trust crane's son.

42:10.495 --> 42:14.397
Henry Parrish is not on
the same team as his father.

42:14.399 --> 42:20.036
Though I do play
the part rather well,

42:20.038 --> 42:23.206
if I say so myself.

42:23.208 --> 42:26.075
"I-i mean you no harm."

42:27.645 --> 42:32.282
"I was conceived out of
ichabod crane's memories...

42:33.551 --> 42:37.086
"and-and as such, I am the son

42:37.088 --> 42:39.622
that he chose to remember."

42:43.160 --> 42:45.728
What fools these mortals be.

42:47.865 --> 42:49.732
Henry, is it?

42:51.001 --> 42:52.735
I think this is the beginning

42:52.737 --> 42:55.238
of a revolutionary friendship.

42:55.240 --> 42:58.908
What do you say we go inside
and have a little chat?

42:58.910 --> 42:59.909
Would you care for a drink?

42:59.911 --> 43:01.911
Would...

43:01.913 --> 43:03.913
Would you happen
to have hot tea?

43:03.915 --> 43:06.049
Henry, you know,

43:06.051 --> 43:09.986
I have a sneaking suspicion
that can be arranged.

43:58.902 --> 44:00.803
<i>thanks for watching
fox on demand.</i>

44:00.805 --> 44:03.573
<i>And don't miss all-new episodes,
only on fox.</i>

44:04.775 --> 44:06.909
Do you two have any idea
what this number is?

44:06.911 --> 44:09.312
- Last night's winning lotto.
- The number of cats in your apartment.

44:09.314 --> 44:14.150
It's the amount of money you two cost the
city working together for three days.

44:14.152 --> 44:16.819
You've been on the job 25 years.
Not a Nick on you.

44:17.855 --> 44:19.689
You get partnered with riggs
three days,

44:19.691 --> 44:22.625
you crashed two cars
and nearly got yourself killed.

44:22.627 --> 44:26.496
- You ever feel like you made the wrong career choice?
- Yeah, the day I met you.

44:26.498 --> 44:29.298
<i>Lethal weapon. Wednesdays.</i>

44:29.300 --> 44:31.768
Man, take the damn shades off!

44:31.770 --> 44:33.369
Man, put the damn shades
back on.

44:33.371 --> 44:34.371
<i>On fox.</i>
