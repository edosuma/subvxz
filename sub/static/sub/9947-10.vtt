Anyone watching, thinking we know
fuck all about knowing fuck all

00:05.800 --> 00:08.559
about owt, needs
to watch their back...

00:08.560 --> 00:10.959
So you've had your Labour,
reclassifying skunk,

00:10.960 --> 00:14.079
sending prices sky-high - literally.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.900
Literally, taking the grass
from its own roots!

00:16.962 --> 00:19.757
Now you've got the ConDemNation.

00:19.758 --> 00:23.250
Liberals nozzing Tories like altar boys
picking dimps up.

00:23.282 --> 00:27.161
Have we had
a national fucking stroke or what?!

00:27.162 --> 00:30.681
Is revolution a word,
or was it never?

00:30.682 --> 00:34.401
Anybody watching needs to know
we cope better than average

00:34.402 --> 00:36.041
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:36.042 --> 00:40.041
Well, for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester,

00:40.162 --> 00:43.241
and they charge us for water!

00:43.242 --> 00:45.321
I wandered lonely as a clown

00:45.322 --> 00:47.201
Necking mushrooms rarely found

00:47.202 --> 00:50.801
This green and pleasant land
of ancient times...

00:50.802 --> 00:53.401
Yak, yak, yak,
yak, yak, yak, yak!

00:53.402 --> 00:56.681
..it's not theirs any more.

00:56.682 --> 00:59.161
This is our England now!

00:59.162 --> 01:03.161
Party!

01:07.482 --> 01:09.721
'Some people are born bad.

01:09.722 --> 01:11.601
'Some are born good.

01:11.602 --> 01:14.161
'You know,
got a lot of love to give.'

01:14.162 --> 01:17.241
Mam.You want a kid of your own,
go and make one.

01:17.242 --> 01:19.281
'And I'm not talking carnal.

01:19.282 --> 01:21.721
'Cos if you can't
get a shag on a Saturday night,

01:21.722 --> 01:25.201
'there's summat
seriously wrong with you.

'I'm talking unconditional. I want someone
to love who loves me as much as I love them.

'Someone to have a trust with.

01:34.002 --> 01:38.001
'An understanding.'

You're all right, Dad,
we'll get our own(!)

01:47.402 --> 01:51.001

03:35.482 --> 03:36.521
It's the eyes.

Take 'em off the cat and put them
on a blonde bird with a beehive

03:39.082 --> 03:42.081
and she'd be singing Son Of
A Preacher Man, I'm telling you.

Rings are symbolic.

03:50.202 --> 03:51.321
Eternal.

03:51.322 --> 03:53.641
Cos there's no beginning and no end.

03:53.642 --> 03:55.561
Like your love for Kelly!

03:55.562 --> 03:59.561
100% cubic zirconia.

04:01.802 --> 04:03.961
So, the cat's for...?

04:03.962 --> 04:07.281
She needed a home.

04:07.282 --> 04:09.241
So does Pissy Percy from the subway.

04:09.242 --> 04:13.041
You'd better not be
dragging him back here.

04:13.042 --> 04:15.361
The ring.

04:15.362 --> 04:19.361
You've only just put it down!

04:24.882 --> 04:28.881
(DUSTY MEOWS)

04:31.882 --> 04:35.161
I will slit the little
bastard's guts open, Mickey!

04:35.162 --> 04:37.401
She might not have eaten it.
Yeah?

04:37.402 --> 04:41.401
Then where the fuck's it gone?!

04:44.922 --> 04:46.001
Half an hour, max.

04:46.002 --> 04:50.001
Starting now.

04:50.042 --> 04:51.401
Come to Daddy.

04:51.402 --> 04:55.401
Come to Daddy.

04:56.082 --> 04:58.721
Gandhi's called me up to Bradford.

04:58.722 --> 05:00.761
Granddad? For...?

05:00.762 --> 05:03.841
Wants to see the books, how I'm
managing the place. I'm not going.

05:03.842 --> 05:05.161
He might cut your supplies off.

05:05.162 --> 05:07.881
He can cut my balls off.
I'm going nowhere.

05:07.882 --> 05:11.881
Got a couple of cars need your Midas touch.
I need you to drop one off, pick one u

05:12.522 --> 05:15.121
I'm helping Ches at the shop.
I did mention it, Jay.

05:15.122 --> 05:19.121
If they're not clean, there won't be a drop tomorrow.
No drop, no job the next

05:31.282 --> 05:32.121
I'll get your cleaning stuff.

05:32.122 --> 05:35.161
You're not eating into my profits.
You'll get your own.

05:35.162 --> 05:36.001
And I'll bell you later
for the where and when.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.721
All right.

05:37.722 --> 05:39.001
Child labour?

05:39.002 --> 05:42.521
Put the Great in Britain.

05:42.522 --> 05:46.521
Once upon a time, you could rely on a spliff
to do what it says on the tin.

05:47.162 --> 05:51.161
These days, it takes a quarter to do
the job of what an eighth used to.

05:55.402 --> 05:58.081
See? Who'd have thought
getting stoned in this day

05:58.082 --> 06:02.081
and age would be such
a fucking problem?

06:02.642 --> 06:06.641
No offence.

06:20.642 --> 06:23.001
What the fuck's that?!
Language!

06:23.002 --> 06:23.761
What's it look like?

06:23.762 --> 06:26.801
Like my allergy in a fur coat.

06:26.802 --> 06:28.841
If she goes, the mice stay.
It's your call.

06:28.842 --> 06:30.281
Mice?

06:30.282 --> 06:32.561
Shane reckons she swallowed a ring
he got for Kel.

06:32.562 --> 06:35.281
Waiting for nature
to take its course.

06:35.282 --> 06:36.801
Can you do it outside? The baby.

06:36.802 --> 06:38.401
You're right.

06:38.402 --> 06:41.241
The laxatives'll be kicking in
any second now.Laxatives?!

06:41.242 --> 06:43.641
(SCREAMS)

06:43.642 --> 06:47.641
Any luck?

06:54.522 --> 06:58.521
Any washing missing?
No.

06:59.482 --> 07:00.961
What's up?

07:00.962 --> 07:04.961
Something missing off our washing line.
What?

07:05.242 --> 07:06.641
My knickers.

07:06.642 --> 07:08.321
How many pairs?

07:08.322 --> 07:12.321
Just the one.

07:14.842 --> 07:16.521
That's open.

07:16.522 --> 07:17.761
Bradford ain't my dream destination.

07:17.762 --> 07:19.441
This one?

07:19.442 --> 07:23.121
But at least it'll
get me away from her.

07:23.122 --> 07:24.841
She's all right, Sita.

07:24.842 --> 07:26.841
She's a good girl.

07:28.682 --> 07:32.681
Till the second after
you've fucked 'em!

07:32.682 --> 07:33.681
We've only got half an hour.

07:33.682 --> 07:35.681
I need to pack.

07:35.682 --> 07:39.361
Auntie Uzma's done it. Socks and undies for the week.
Couple of vests.Right.

07:39.362 --> 07:40.721
Laters, bro.

07:40.722 --> 07:42.561
See you in a bit.

07:42.562 --> 07:45.241
I'm leaving you in charge, not her.

08:06.322 --> 08:10.321
Ta-da!

08:10.322 --> 08:12.001
An eternity ring?
Yeah.

08:12.002 --> 08:15.481
It took a fucking eternity to
get it out of that thing!

08:15.482 --> 08:17.921
Explain.The ring was
stuck in her ring.

08:17.922 --> 08:21.521
Procedure, got it out, realised

08:21.522 --> 08:25.521
she wasn't feeling herself, did
a blood test, and then...she's dying.

08:28.402 --> 08:31.881
She's got the AIDS.

08:31.882 --> 08:35.321
Maybe the kindest thing would be
to spare her any more pain. >

08:35.322 --> 08:39.321
It might be wise to think
about...getting her put to sleep.

08:41.162 --> 08:43.280
Would you have had
Liberace put down?!

08:43.282 --> 08:46.561
No. Freddie Mercury? No!

08:46.562 --> 08:49.041
Dusty will die surrounded by love.

08:49.042 --> 08:50.601
My love.

08:50.602 --> 08:54.601
Does she look like
she's any sort of danger?

08:54.802 --> 08:58.801
Sweet Jesus, Mickey,
you could be infected.

09:03.842 --> 09:05.721
Got any Spaghetti Hoops?

09:05.722 --> 09:08.121
We've got Alphabetti.

09:08.122 --> 09:11.321
I'm dyslexic.

09:11.322 --> 09:17.001
30 float, I've took 32.80 since you've
left, so that's 62.80. You can count it.

09:17.002 --> 09:20.561
Can you stomach beans with your,
you know, weakness?

09:20.562 --> 09:21.601
Is anyone serving?

09:21.602 --> 09:22.401
Yeah, sorry, one minute.

09:22.402 --> 09:26.401
I'll handle this.

09:27.162 --> 09:28.841
3.69, please.

09:28.842 --> 09:30.641
I can eat 'em
just as long as I'm sitting down.

09:30.642 --> 09:34.641
Thank you.

09:38.522 --> 09:41.041
Count it?

09:41.042 --> 09:42.241
When I cash up.

09:42.242 --> 09:44.361
I do not rob mates.

09:44.362 --> 09:48.281
Ches told me to look after the place, and
that's what I'll do, like it or not.

09:48.282 --> 09:49.721
You got that?

10:00.802 --> 10:04.801
If I get me hands on you, I'll have
yer bollocks for earrings!

10:04.842 --> 10:07.601
Are you OK?

10:07.602 --> 10:09.521
No! Me knickers have gone again!

10:09.522 --> 10:11.641
I think we should get
the police involved.

10:11.642 --> 10:13.841
What are those useless bastards
going to do?

10:13.842 --> 10:17.241
You're not the only woman round here.
Avril's in danger, Letitia's in danger.

10:17.242 --> 10:19.281
Danger of what?

10:19.282 --> 10:21.921
There's a sexual deviant
on the loose.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.361
Throw a rock round here,
you'd hit a dozen.

10:23.362 --> 10:25.081
Someone's stealing underwear.

10:25.082 --> 10:29.081
Maybe the best thing is to dry them
indoors from now on.

10:29.682 --> 10:33.041
I'm not having my behaviour
dictated to by some fucking nonce.

10:33.042 --> 10:34.561
The knickers stay.

10:34.562 --> 10:36.041
Where's my pussy?

10:36.042 --> 10:40.041
It kicked Cilla off with her asthma.

10:50.122 --> 10:53.601
Wanker.

10:53.602 --> 10:56.801
We have to keep it
away from the baby.

10:56.802 --> 10:58.561
I want that thing out.

10:58.562 --> 11:02.281
It's a fucking liability.

11:02.282 --> 11:04.761
I didn't know you could get
queer cats.

11:04.762 --> 11:06.521
Dusty's female.

11:06.522 --> 11:09.841
How the fuck did she get the AIDS,
then? Is she a cat lesbian?

11:09.842 --> 11:11.761
Can lesbians get the AIDS?

11:11.762 --> 11:14.241
How can you even think like that?

11:14.242 --> 11:16.481
It's the 21st century,
for fuck's sake!

11:16.482 --> 11:18.761
I've asked for counselling.What?

11:18.762 --> 11:21.121
And how are they going to do that,
you soft twat?

11:21.122 --> 11:23.721
It's not like she can tell you
how she's feeling.

11:23.722 --> 11:27.281
For me, you bastard, not her!

11:27.282 --> 11:31.281
She's facing a messy,
painful, elon...gelas...

11:34.442 --> 11:38.441
Er... A really drawn-out death.

11:38.562 --> 11:41.601
And I'm going to guarantee a
dignified ending to this lady's life.

11:41.602 --> 11:43.481
You could have it yourself.

11:43.482 --> 11:44.921
You can't catch the AIDS from a cat.

11:44.922 --> 11:46.201
She fucking did.

11:46.202 --> 11:49.801
And if you catch it
from a toilet seat...

11:49.802 --> 11:52.641
It's all body fluids,
not just jizz and fanny batter.

11:52.642 --> 11:55.281
It's tears, spit, puke, piss.

11:55.282 --> 11:58.801
I don't want one of us being
the first to catch it from a sneeze.

11:58.802 --> 12:00.921
That's ridiculous.

12:00.922 --> 12:04.481
So's fucking a monkey,
but that's where it came from.

12:04.482 --> 12:07.601
You don't think someone's been
slotting the cat one, do you?

12:07.602 --> 12:09.161
You can't catch the AI...

12:09.162 --> 12:12.921
It's not even called AIDS -
it's FIDS.

12:12.922 --> 12:16.361
Feline Immune...

12:16.362 --> 12:17.401
..DS.

12:17.402 --> 12:20.321
Dusty needs care.

12:20.322 --> 12:21.721
And tenderness.

12:21.722 --> 12:25.041
And love.

12:25.042 --> 12:29.041
And if you feel that there's
no place in this house for her...

12:29.442 --> 12:33.321
..then there's no place for me.

12:33.322 --> 12:34.681
Ugh!

12:34.682 --> 12:38.681
(DUSTY MEOWS)

12:43.233 --> 12:45.632
Just scraping out.
But you know that already.

12:45.633 --> 12:47.932
I've got better things to do
than sit watching you earn minimum wage.

12:47.933 --> 12:50.411
What is it with you?
Thought we were getting on.

12:50.412 --> 12:52.571
Got anything for a gyppy tummy?

12:52.572 --> 12:54.011
This is a family business.

12:54.012 --> 12:57.131
Not family and cousin's mates.
Gyppy how?

12:57.132 --> 13:01.131
Bit like buses. You wait ages for
one, then three come all at once.

13:04.892 --> 13:08.251
Well, cousin's mate will be out
of there as soon as he's done.

13:08.252 --> 13:09.563
Give you a chance to get
your pulse back to normal.

13:09.564 --> 13:10.532
How many times, Carl?

13:10.533 --> 13:12.531
You're not my type.
I meant whenever I went in the till.

13:12.532 --> 13:15.051
I handle a bit of cash,
your blood pressure goes up.

13:15.052 --> 13:16.691
You can go now. I'll finish up.

13:16.692 --> 13:19.451
Assuming I'm a thief?
Assuming I'll rob you blind?

13:19.452 --> 13:20.929
I never said...

13:20.930 --> 13:24.409
It's been like this since day one.
Grew up on a council estate - scum.

13:24.410 --> 13:27.729
Went to a comp - scum.
Has a pint - scum.

13:27.730 --> 13:29.529
Dad's a waster - scum.

13:29.530 --> 13:32.249
Asian - uptight.
University - uptight.

13:32.250 --> 13:34.449
Non-drinker - uptight. Non-smoker...

13:34.450 --> 13:35.449
You know nothing about me.

13:35.450 --> 13:36.969
Ditto.

13:36.970 --> 13:40.769
I'm here because I know, and you don't, that
Ches wants to make a proper go at this.

13:40.770 --> 13:44.129
He's working his balls off. He asked
for my help and I said yes.

13:44.130 --> 13:48.049
So grab that and make yourself
useful, or shut the f...

13:48.050 --> 13:52.049
..or get off my back.

13:56.610 --> 13:59.409
Is your cat dead yet?

13:59.410 --> 14:00.929
No, she fucking isn't!

14:00.930 --> 14:04.849
This car'll stink soon,
you not washing and her decaying.

14:04.850 --> 14:06.129
I don't need this!

14:06.130 --> 14:08.089
Let me help you.

14:08.090 --> 14:09.649
You'll take us in?

14:09.650 --> 14:11.209
Oh, no, I can't stand cats.

14:11.210 --> 14:13.249
I've got a mate on me dinner round,

14:13.250 --> 14:15.609
might be able
to give you a few pointers.

14:15.610 --> 14:16.809
Give you a shout later.

14:16.810 --> 14:19.449
Really?

14:19.450 --> 14:23.009
Maybe they've not been taken,
maybe you've just misplaced them.

14:23.010 --> 14:24.729
How d'you misplace your knickers?!

14:24.730 --> 14:27.409
I'm always losing mine.
Stopped wearing them now.

14:27.410 --> 14:29.689
Anything can happen
after too many vodkas.

14:29.690 --> 14:31.769
Not been that pissed
for a long time.

14:31.770 --> 14:33.209
Or got lucky!

14:33.210 --> 14:35.009
Still in thewashing machine, maybe?

14:35.010 --> 14:36.609
Probably just someone
having a laugh.

14:36.610 --> 14:38.849
Just what we thought
in the summer of '74.

14:38.850 --> 14:42.169
Lingerie flying off lines
all round the estate.

14:42.170 --> 14:44.449
Complained, but the police
did nothing.

14:44.450 --> 14:48.049
In me teens, I went out with a girl
we used to call Yo-Yo Knickers.

14:48.050 --> 14:49.689
Used them as ankle warmers.

14:49.690 --> 14:52.489
But one woman was singled out.

14:52.490 --> 14:55.449
Knicker nicker was obsessed.
Killed her in the end.

14:55.450 --> 14:56.529
Me mum told me about that.

14:56.530 --> 14:59.729
Kept her body in the freezer.
Used to take her out now and then,

14:59.730 --> 15:02.209
defrosted her for a bit of
how's-your-father.

15:03.410 --> 15:05.889
They found the body when
his house was broke into.

15:05.890 --> 15:08.489
Burglar found him in bed with
a corpse and called the filth.

15:08.490 --> 15:12.489
Maybe he's back!

15:13.290 --> 15:15.609
Something I should have told you,
Micky.

15:15.610 --> 15:17.769
Leave any prejudice
at the front door,

15:17.770 --> 15:20.049
cos he's got full-blown HGV.

15:20.050 --> 15:22.449
It's HI...

15:22.450 --> 15:25.529
Lulu!

15:25.530 --> 15:27.529
Wilkommen!

15:27.530 --> 15:31.529
There is nothing to fear.
No judgement here.

15:33.490 --> 15:35.329
I know there'll be pain.

15:35.330 --> 15:38.969
And I know it'll only get worse.
I can cope with all of that.

15:38.970 --> 15:40.489
I think.

15:40.490 --> 15:42.889
I just need... a bit of...

15:42.890 --> 15:44.289
Support?

15:44.290 --> 15:46.809
I know. Come in.

15:46.810 --> 15:50.809
Mind the yucca!

15:51.970 --> 15:54.689
Feel no shame.

15:54.690 --> 15:56.089
I don't.

15:56.090 --> 15:57.129
Good.

15:57.130 --> 16:00.489
Stay positive. Pun intended!

16:00.490 --> 16:03.449
Spam, peas and mash.
Liquidised, as requested.

16:03.450 --> 16:04.969
Oh, thank you very much. >

16:04.970 --> 16:08.049
I can't put anything solid
in me mouth without gagging now.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.489
Oh, the irony!

16:09.490 --> 16:13.049
I'll bow out here.
Be gentle, he's quite fragile.

16:13.050 --> 16:17.049
Kid gloves.

16:22.170 --> 16:26.169
Be a good idea if we closed up
for the night, get this finished.

16:32.050 --> 16:33.449
I don't think you're scum.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.049
I still think you're uptight.

16:35.050 --> 16:37.769
Who else would use a word
like uptight, you hippy?

16:37.770 --> 16:38.409
I'm just worried about Ches.

16:38.410 --> 16:41.289
Ches could land in a barrel of shite
and come out shining.

16:41.290 --> 16:43.489
Third time
Grandad's bailed him out.

16:43.490 --> 16:46.449
Well, not him exactly,
but his family.

16:46.450 --> 16:48.809
First his dad, then mum, now him.

16:48.810 --> 16:52.809
Better do right by him, then.

16:54.770 --> 16:56.729
My dad left when I was nine.

16:56.730 --> 17:00.209
Went to Pakistan to arrange a
business deal and never came back.

17:00.210 --> 17:01.649
Yeah, Ches told me.

17:01.650 --> 17:05.128
It was a car crash, wasn't it?

17:05.130 --> 17:08.409
He ran off with his cousin.

17:08.410 --> 17:12.409
He left my mum
with four kids under 10.

17:12.730 --> 17:16.209
No-one else knows that. Secret.

17:16.210 --> 17:20.209
What are you telling me for?

17:22.490 --> 17:23.848
Coffee?

17:23.849 --> 17:27.848
One sugar.

17:29.130 --> 17:33.129
Don't tell Ches.

17:36.450 --> 17:38.889
BELL RINGS

17:38.890 --> 17:40.329
What time d'you call this?!

17:40.330 --> 17:42.049
Time for you to go home.

17:42.050 --> 17:45.409
What, at 11.20?! What is this,
fucking Prohibition?

17:45.410 --> 17:48.689
Is Eliot Ness back in town?
You know, the Untouchables...

17:48.690 --> 17:49.929
Sorry, no offence, mate.

17:49.930 --> 17:53.929
Girls are reclaiming the night.
Nutter on the loose, they're sending a clear message...

17:53.970 --> 17:55.569
they will not be intimidated.

17:55.570 --> 17:58.489
He fucking will be
if he claps eyes on that lot!

17:58.490 --> 18:00.049
Look, if you're scared of him...

18:00.050 --> 18:02.849
Are we shite scared of him!

18:02.850 --> 18:06.129
Then why are you allowing
said pervert

18:06.130 --> 18:10.009
to send you home
earlier than anticipated?

18:10.010 --> 18:12.729
'Ey! We're not going home early
cos we're scared.

18:12.730 --> 18:16.729
We're going home to show him we're
not intimidated by his behaviour.

18:18.410 --> 18:22.049
So, what, is that some sort of
reverse psychology or summat?

18:22.050 --> 18:23.569
All I know is, I get an early night.

18:23.570 --> 18:27.529
Oh, stay, come on!

18:27.530 --> 18:31.529
Who in their fucking right mind's
gonna sexually assault any of you?

18:34.530 --> 18:36.129
What?

18:36.130 --> 18:38.729
I thought we were closed.

18:38.730 --> 18:39.689
You OK?

18:39.690 --> 18:41.209
We're reclaiming the night.

18:41.210 --> 18:41.889
Who from?

18:41.890 --> 18:43.569
From whoever it was that took it!

18:43.570 --> 18:45.809
There's a thief out there

18:45.810 --> 18:49.809
stealing Mimi's undergarments
to aid his onanism.

18:51.930 --> 18:53.449
What, and he's out there now?

18:53.450 --> 18:56.929
God help him is he is.
Imagine that poor woman

18:56.930 --> 18:59.089
and the kids she left behind.

19:00.730 --> 19:03.689
..And she's not coming back.

19:03.690 --> 19:07.689
Give us two pints of semi-skimmed,
then we'll get off.

19:10.290 --> 19:11.769
88p, please, Mimi.

19:11.770 --> 19:13.049
On me slate.

19:13.050 --> 19:16.729
Ches has left strict instructions -
no slates from now on.

19:16.730 --> 19:20.729
She's like royalty,
doesn't carry cash.

19:25.250 --> 19:26.529
I'll get you a cab.

19:26.530 --> 19:27.689
What for?

19:27.690 --> 19:28.809
You heard, there's some nutter
out there.

19:28.810 --> 19:30.089
I'll stay here.

19:30.090 --> 19:30.849
You can't.

19:30.850 --> 19:34.849
Says who?

19:36.930 --> 19:40.249
Me mam says she knew
from when I was an infant.

19:40.250 --> 19:41.209
But how could she...

19:41.210 --> 19:44.209
According to her,
my first word was "cock".

19:44.210 --> 19:47.649
It was rejection from there on in.

19:47.650 --> 19:51.449
From those that should have cared
for me the most.

19:51.450 --> 19:53.969
I imagine my story's very similar
to yours.

19:53.970 --> 19:55.289
What d'you mean?

19:55.290 --> 19:57.049
There's no need to be coy.

19:57.050 --> 19:58.649
Nothing wrong with my family!

19:58.650 --> 20:01.489
Yeah, but they did kick you out
as soon as they found out

20:01.490 --> 20:04.729
about your... condition,
didn't they?

20:04.730 --> 20:06.329
My condition?

20:06.330 --> 20:08.049
Oh, denial.

20:08.050 --> 20:11.489
Your prognosis is much better
than mine,

20:11.490 --> 20:13.689
but it's still a lot to take on,
in't it?

20:13.690 --> 20:16.849
W-What exactly did Lillian tell you?

20:16.850 --> 20:20.849
Me mind was too awash with Lebanon's
finest at the time, but I know

20:22.010 --> 20:23.849
you need me.

20:23.850 --> 20:27.569
We are cut from the same cloth,
you and me, Micky.

20:27.570 --> 20:28.929
Well, I don't think we...

20:28.930 --> 20:32.929
Yeah, separate us, but our stories
are heart-breakingly similar.

20:34.170 --> 20:37.849
Look, er... I think you've got
the wrong end of the stick, Lulu.

20:37.850 --> 20:41.849
There's no need to explain.
I know everything I need to know,

20:43.130 --> 20:45.889
and I know that I need you to know

20:45.890 --> 20:48.969
that as long as there is breath
in my body,

20:48.970 --> 20:52.529
there is room for you here.

20:52.530 --> 20:56.529
And there's room for you here.

20:57.410 --> 20:58.689
There is a price, however.

20:58.690 --> 21:01.089
I thought there might be!

21:01.090 --> 21:05.089
A big stiff one inside me
before I nod off.

21:05.330 --> 21:07.569
Dubonnet. Double.

21:07.570 --> 21:11.569
(HE LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

21:14.450 --> 21:18.449
RUMBLING THUD

21:34.290 --> 21:35.729
(HE GASPS)

21:35.730 --> 21:37.649
I need a once-over from a doctor.

21:37.650 --> 21:39.249
Iama doctor.

21:39.250 --> 21:43.249
Not yet you're not! I think I bust
my wrist when I fell.

21:45.170 --> 21:46.209
Can you move your fingers?

21:46.210 --> 21:47.409
(HE WINCES)

21:47.410 --> 21:48.489
Nothing broken.

21:48.490 --> 21:51.409
How am I gonna drive for Jamie
tomorrow? You'll have to.

21:51.410 --> 21:53.569
Like I've got nothing better to do!

21:53.570 --> 21:57.569
If you don't cover me,
I'm out of a job.

21:59.210 --> 22:00.529
Aagh!

22:00.530 --> 22:01.609
Aah, shit!

22:01.610 --> 22:02.929
No way, Carl!

22:02.930 --> 22:03.489
What?

22:03.490 --> 22:04.609
Coming over all damaged.

22:04.610 --> 22:05.969
You twatted me with a bat!

22:05.970 --> 22:07.969
Trying to kiss me. Cheap.

22:07.970 --> 22:11.969
You could not be more wrong.
I felt a bit... woozy.

22:12.650 --> 22:16.649
Well, if you still feel "woozy"
in the morning, then get to A&E!

22:23.090 --> 22:25.929
I'm sorry about this, Lulu.
There's been an accident.

22:25.930 --> 22:28.009
Oh, yer all right, Micky.

22:28.010 --> 22:31.329
If it weren't for these panty pads,
I'd be leaving a trail meself.

22:31.330 --> 22:32.129
This isn't me!

22:32.130 --> 22:33.809
I know, there's much more to you

22:33.810 --> 22:36.209
than just a body
that's failing its function.

22:36.210 --> 22:38.449
I need to explain meself.

22:38.450 --> 22:40.529
This isn't even human.

22:40.530 --> 22:42.449
What have they done to you?!

22:42.450 --> 22:46.449
You've allowed their poison,
their prejudice, to warp your mind!

22:49.970 --> 22:53.089
You fucking cunts!

22:53.090 --> 22:55.449
He is a human being!

22:55.450 --> 22:58.609
If you prick him - which I don't
advise, by the way...

22:58.610 --> 23:02.609
does he not bleed?

23:04.810 --> 23:07.409
You poor, poor boy.

23:07.410 --> 23:09.889
Look, I'm all right, honest!

23:09.890 --> 23:12.329
Fuck 'em. Fuck their prejudice.

23:12.330 --> 23:14.529
Fuck their world.

23:14.530 --> 23:16.249
It's not that bad out here.

23:16.250 --> 23:18.249
15 years ago I got the news,

23:18.250 --> 23:19.929
and I wept.

23:19.930 --> 23:22.929
But the closer I get,
the more it appeals.

23:22.930 --> 23:25.889
And when I go,
I want to be allowed to go.

23:25.890 --> 23:28.289
I don't want to be strapped
to some machine

23:28.290 --> 23:30.449
that's pumping breath
back into a body

23:30.450 --> 23:34.449
that's convinced it's breathed
its last. What I want...

23:35.210 --> 23:38.689
is "DNR" written across here.

23:38.690 --> 23:42.689
Go on. DNR.

23:43.250 --> 23:45.209
Do...

23:45.210 --> 23:47.249
Not...

23:47.250 --> 23:51.249
Resuscitate.

24:02.650 --> 24:04.609
I dictated how I lived my life,

24:04.610 --> 24:08.609
I'll do the same with me death.
You'll make sure, will you, Micky?

24:09.850 --> 24:11.649
Course I will.

24:11.650 --> 24:15.649
When I slip into unconsciousness,
let me go.

24:16.850 --> 24:18.932
I will.

24:20.730 --> 24:21.973
I will.

24:27.489 --> 24:28.528
Not dead, then?

24:28.529 --> 24:31.488
Sorry to disappoint.

24:31.489 --> 24:32.448
I've already eaten.

24:32.449 --> 24:34.488
Did you make your own breakfast?

24:34.489 --> 24:38.488
A man who can cook for himself.
There is hope for the world yet.

24:38.929 --> 24:41.168
New job, early start.

24:41.169 --> 24:43.448
He's covering for Carl
while Carl covers for Chesney.

24:43.449 --> 24:46.168
Oh. A working man now?

24:46.169 --> 24:50.168
A little good luck present
for the man bringing the cash in.

24:52.089 --> 24:56.088
Better get off.
Don't want to be late.

25:01.969 --> 25:04.128
Fine, thanks for asking.

25:04.129 --> 25:05.408
I said I'm sorry.

25:05.409 --> 25:09.408
Your phone's off.
I told you to keep it on.

25:09.489 --> 25:11.328
I need you to drop that car later.

25:11.329 --> 25:14.928
Aidan's getting it ready.
Should be done around one-ish. Here's the address.

25:14.929 --> 25:18.408
The car you need to pick up
is at the same address, OK?

25:18.409 --> 25:22.408
Cool.

25:26.009 --> 25:29.288
Say yeah
and I'll agree to drop the charges.

25:29.289 --> 25:31.888
To what? And what charges?

25:31.889 --> 25:35.888
Doing me driving and ABH.
You know, twatting me head, nearly busting me hand.

25:35.889 --> 25:38.608
Joking aside, I'll be out
of a job if that car's not dropped.

25:38.609 --> 25:39.968
Well, it's no good looking at me.

25:39.969 --> 25:42.888
You can't drive?

25:42.889 --> 25:46.888
Shit.

25:49.889 --> 25:52.728
Seen this? Done a crackin' job.

25:52.729 --> 25:55.048
I hope he'll be rewarded
for his efforts.

25:55.049 --> 25:56.168
Yeah, yeah.

25:56.169 --> 25:59.688
If you're still in the mood, Aidan,
the pub could do with a going over.

25:59.689 --> 26:02.328
Let me get a photo. Bend down
like you're cleaning the wheels.

26:02.329 --> 26:04.288
I feel stupid.

26:04.289 --> 26:08.288
You look stupid.

26:08.329 --> 26:12.288
I've been worried sick that some
nutter's been tracking me down.

26:12.289 --> 26:16.288
And all along it was him!

26:16.729 --> 26:19.728
How dare you hit him?

26:19.729 --> 26:23.728
Oh, stop it!
Just fuckin' stop it now!

26:25.809 --> 26:26.728
Mum! Fuckin' hell!

26:26.729 --> 26:30.368
Spare the rod, spoil the child!

26:30.369 --> 26:32.048
Is that what Cilla has
to look forward to, is it?

26:32.049 --> 26:34.248
Fuckin' hell, Libby!

26:34.249 --> 26:38.168
I'm not going to smack her, am I,
soft shite? She's a girl!

26:38.169 --> 26:39.488
Oh, so it's just the lads, is it?

26:39.489 --> 26:43.488
No wonder they turned out
as well as they have. Oh!

26:45.569 --> 26:49.568
I know the reality of bringing
lads up. And if you're not firm

26:50.169 --> 26:54.168
with them, tough with them,
then you fuck them up for life!

26:55.929 --> 26:59.928
Don't ask.

27:00.969 --> 27:04.408
God. Urgh! Sweet Jesus!

27:04.409 --> 27:06.368
It's too late now, innit?

27:06.369 --> 27:09.608
It's too late now.

27:09.609 --> 27:12.728
Fucking Spanish onions
for your cat medicine.

27:12.729 --> 27:16.728
To late take them out
now, innit, Dusty?

27:17.289 --> 27:19.488
She had an accident.

27:19.489 --> 27:22.208
I feel like I've sprung
a leak meself sometimes.

27:22.209 --> 27:26.208
Maybe later. Would you give that
a stir while I get rid of this?

27:33.329 --> 27:37.328
You know, before you came,
the very day before you came,

27:37.769 --> 27:40.248
I felt like
I was coming to the end.

27:40.249 --> 27:43.688
I thought, "What the fuck
have you got to live for?

27:43.689 --> 27:45.808
"Who the fuck?"

27:45.809 --> 27:49.808
I realised I had nothing at all,
nothing except liquefied Pot Noodles

27:50.089 --> 27:52.208
and power ballads.

27:52.209 --> 27:55.448
I found myself praying to God

27:55.449 --> 27:58.528
for a sign. The very next day,

27:58.529 --> 28:01.088
in you rolled, looking for advice.

28:01.089 --> 28:03.048
I'm a lucky man.

28:03.049 --> 28:06.128
Thank you, God.

28:06.129 --> 28:08.328
Thank you, Micky.

28:08.329 --> 28:11.248
Listen, I'm going to put
the feelers out for a flat,

28:11.249 --> 28:13.168
so I won't be under your feet
for too long.

28:13.169 --> 28:17.128
You being here, sweet boy,
is not problem.

28:17.129 --> 28:21.128
No problem at all.

28:21.489 --> 28:25.488
Divine. Homemade food and
good company, what could be better?

28:27.129 --> 28:29.528
CAT MEOWS

28:29.529 --> 28:31.928
Phone an ambulance!

28:31.929 --> 28:35.928
She's having a fit.
Phone an ambulance!

28:35.969 --> 28:38.128
Where we off to, then?

28:38.129 --> 28:40.288
I had the address here.
Jamie gave it me before.

28:40.289 --> 28:42.208
Just give him a shout.

28:42.209 --> 28:45.088
And say what? "That address you
gave me - dickhead here's lost it."

28:45.089 --> 28:49.088
Sat-nav. With any luck,
the home button should do it.

28:49.449 --> 28:51.528
'In 500 metres, turn left.'

28:51.529 --> 28:53.648
Not as daft as you look, are you?

28:53.649 --> 28:57.648
No. But you are.

29:02.729 --> 29:05.368
'You have reached your destination.'

29:05.369 --> 29:06.688
So where's this car
you're picking up, then?

29:06.689 --> 29:08.808
Could be parked up anywhere.

29:08.809 --> 29:10.808
Could be that one.

29:10.809 --> 29:13.248
Or that one.

29:13.249 --> 29:17.248
Oh? Another satisfied customer.

29:19.769 --> 29:23.768
I only reported it missing this
morning. About an hour or so ago.

29:24.129 --> 29:26.248
So where did you find it?

29:26.249 --> 29:27.848
Can you fetch me some ID?

29:27.849 --> 29:31.848
Like car registration documents,
please? I'll get the paperwork.

29:35.009 --> 29:36.768
Fuck's sake, get back in. Come on!

29:36.769 --> 29:37.688
What?

29:37.689 --> 29:41.688
The car's robbed.
This is where it's robbed from.

29:51.009 --> 29:53.488
Near 200 quid to the fuckin' vet,

29:53.489 --> 29:56.808
only to be told the reason she
was having difficulty breathing

29:56.809 --> 29:59.288
was because she had more
marijuana in her system

29:59.289 --> 30:03.048
than a Rastafari with a bad habit,
and her collar was too tight.

30:03.049 --> 30:04.408
Sorry.

30:04.409 --> 30:06.848
I appreciate your concern
for a creature, Micky,

30:06.849 --> 30:09.528
but for fuck's sake,
she's a twatting cat!

30:09.529 --> 30:11.168
It's not exactly the point.

30:11.169 --> 30:14.008
It is when you're talking to someone
who's looking death in the face!

30:14.009 --> 30:18.008
Who puts their head on the pillow, never knowing
whether they're going to wake up again!

30:18.329 --> 30:20.328
Keep you're voice down!
You're upsetting Dusty.

30:20.329 --> 30:23.808
Fuck Dusty! Fuck her! What about me?

30:23.809 --> 30:26.048
And why is it always about
you with people like you?

30:26.049 --> 30:27.888
God, every person in my life,

30:27.889 --> 30:31.888
it's, "Me, me, me, me, me." And you
know what, Lulu? I've had enough.

30:32.169 --> 30:33.448
Where are you going?

30:33.449 --> 30:37.448
It's not right me being here, and I know
that you need someone, but it ain't me.

30:37.569 --> 30:38.648
Don't leave.

30:38.649 --> 30:42.208
You've been really kind to me, Lulu,
and while I've been here

30:42.209 --> 30:44.848
I've learned
a really valuable lesson,

30:44.849 --> 30:47.048
but in the end it's just me.

30:47.049 --> 30:49.408
I'm on me own.

30:49.409 --> 30:52.848
The doctor's given me one month!
I don't want to die alone!

30:52.849 --> 30:56.848
We all die alone. I'll tell Lillian.
I'll get in touch with a support group.

30:57.209 --> 30:59.968
Don't leave me,
you hard-hearted bastard!

30:59.969 --> 31:01.928
Get off!

31:01.929 --> 31:03.888
I know your suffering.

31:03.889 --> 31:07.888
I understand better than any mother,
any brother, any lover.

31:09.169 --> 31:12.008
Look, it's not me, OK?

31:12.009 --> 31:15.888
I didn't need to lie to you
about the AIDS thing, but...

31:15.889 --> 31:19.888
It's Dusty who's got it.

31:22.969 --> 31:26.968
I mentioned it to Lillian and she said
that you might be able to help us.

31:27.089 --> 31:29.128
You lied.

31:29.129 --> 31:32.088
I tried to tell you,
but you wouldn't listen

31:32.089 --> 31:35.088
and then it just went on
too far and...

31:35.089 --> 31:37.248
Picking over my life,

31:37.249 --> 31:41.248
my disease, to help that.

31:41.289 --> 31:44.008
MEOW!

31:44.009 --> 31:45.728
Get out!

31:45.729 --> 31:47.728
You deserve everything
that's coming to you!

31:47.729 --> 31:48.888
Get out!

31:48.889 --> 31:52.888
Drop dead, you twisted old fruit!

31:55.329 --> 31:57.728
Fuck. Shit.

31:57.729 --> 31:59.888
Oh, fuck! Shit!

31:59.889 --> 32:02.288
Phone.

32:02.289 --> 32:06.288
Fuck! Oh, shit. Fuck! Help! Help.

32:11.929 --> 32:15.928
Thanks very much.

32:20.289 --> 32:21.328
Cunt.

32:21.329 --> 32:22.608
I couldn't just let you die.

32:22.609 --> 32:23.288
Why?

32:23.289 --> 32:25.288
I wouldn't be able
to live with myself.

32:25.289 --> 32:29.288
(COUGHS)

32:32.569 --> 32:36.568
You might have fucked up your own
life, but you're not fucking up mine.

32:39.289 --> 32:41.528
The medic said
you'd not been taking your meds.

32:41.529 --> 32:42.808
What's the use?

32:42.809 --> 32:46.168
Right. Here's the deal.
I stick around as long as you're still breathing

32:46.169 --> 32:49.728
on the understanding that
you just stop your fucking moaning.

32:49.729 --> 32:51.048
I don't need it.

32:51.049 --> 32:52.088
You're staying?

32:52.089 --> 32:53.648
If you kick off again, I'm gone.

32:53.649 --> 32:55.968
You can drown in your own piss,
for all I care. You got that?

32:55.969 --> 32:57.088
Loud and clear.

32:57.089 --> 32:58.688
There's going to be a few changes.

32:58.689 --> 33:02.608
I'm going to decorate.
Something bright and welcoming.

33:02.609 --> 33:06.528
We could re-carpet, new couch,
some drapes.

33:06.529 --> 33:08.048
That's curtains.

33:08.049 --> 33:10.088
Cost a bit.

33:10.089 --> 33:11.448
I've got a few bob stashed.

33:11.449 --> 33:13.648
I can dip into me funeral fund.

33:13.649 --> 33:16.728
And there's a quiz every Sunday
at the Seaman's Arms. We're going.

33:16.729 --> 33:17.568
I don't think...

33:17.569 --> 33:20.608
I don't think...
When was the last time you partied?

33:20.609 --> 33:22.128
Lady Di's funeral.

33:22.129 --> 33:24.368
I threw some flowers in the canal,

33:24.369 --> 33:28.368
got trollied on GHB, came home,
locked the door and that was it.

33:28.369 --> 33:31.208
So it's the quiz for starters,
then we can hit a few clubs.

33:31.209 --> 33:33.168
There's plenty of '80s nights
and that,

33:33.169 --> 33:35.128
so you'll be able
to throw a few shapes.

33:35.129 --> 33:38.448
There's a big world out there, Lulu.
A fucking...

33:38.449 --> 33:40.928
A big world.

33:40.929 --> 33:44.928
This calls for a celebration.

33:46.569 --> 33:49.768
No, no, no, no, no.
Let's do it properly.

33:49.769 --> 33:53.768
Bubbly.

34:04.689 --> 34:06.608
WOLF WHISTLING

34:06.609 --> 34:10.608
Oi, stop looking at me arse!

34:20.329 --> 34:24.328
MUSIC

34:33.329 --> 34:37.328
SIREN WAILS

34:44.289 --> 34:47.248
Shit.

34:47.248 --> 34:50.608
In about ten seconds I want you
to slam on, get out and run.

34:50.609 --> 34:53.487
Dump your jacket just in case
they get a description out.

34:53.489 --> 34:54.648
What about you?

34:54.649 --> 34:58.208
I'll get in the driving seat. Hopefully they'll
follow me and you'll be able to get away.

34:58.209 --> 35:00.208
But your hand!

35:00.209 --> 35:02.368
I was lying.
I just wanted you with me.

35:02.369 --> 35:03.928
I'll ditch the car
as soon as I can.

35:03.929 --> 35:05.408
And if you don't get the chance?

35:05.409 --> 35:09.408
Break now! Now!

35:25.369 --> 35:29.368
Jacket!

35:48.209 --> 35:51.128
I'm sorry. If I'd known the car was
robbed, I would've never put you

35:51.129 --> 35:52.808
in that position, I swear to God.

35:52.809 --> 35:56.808
I swear to God.

36:29.689 --> 36:33.568
Right. It's nicely chilled.

36:33.569 --> 36:37.168
I got some pate and a few baps.
Some nuts and crisps.

36:37.169 --> 36:39.968
Thought we could have
a bit of a do, you know.

36:39.969 --> 36:42.168
Not the cheap shit, either.

36:42.169 --> 36:46.168
Only the best for us.

36:47.209 --> 36:51.208
I can teach you and you can teach me
and face it all together.

36:51.369 --> 36:55.368
Get each other through. Just me
and you against the world, eh, Lulu?

36:59.289 --> 37:03.288
No!

37:11.876 --> 37:13.915
There you go. Thanks.

37:13.916 --> 37:17.915
Thanks.

37:28.636 --> 37:32.435
You didn't know he was Beirut?

37:32.436 --> 37:33.715
Fruit - queer.

37:33.716 --> 37:35.955
Dunno, don't think so.

37:35.956 --> 37:39.955
One of God's innocents, aren't you?

37:40.076 --> 37:41.675
He was a gay.

37:41.676 --> 37:45.675
No(!)

37:45.836 --> 37:48.515
I used to work in a bar
in the Gay Village,

37:48.516 --> 37:50.755
years before it was the Gay Village.

37:50.756 --> 37:52.715
The laughs we used to have.

37:52.716 --> 37:56.355
Such good people to be with.
The life and soul of the party.

37:56.356 --> 37:58.115
But then when the pubs shut,

37:58.116 --> 37:59.795
and the clubs and the bars,

37:59.796 --> 38:03.795
they go home alone
and cry themselves to sleep.

38:06.876 --> 38:09.915
So it's down to you to organise
his send-off.

38:09.916 --> 38:12.955
Will you help us?
I don't know where to start.

38:12.956 --> 38:14.635
He gave me his card and PIN number.

38:14.636 --> 38:18.635
He took to you, didn't he?

38:21.716 --> 38:23.755
He didn't...

38:23.756 --> 38:27.035
I mean, he didn't...you know...

38:27.036 --> 38:30.275
..charge you rent?

38:30.276 --> 38:32.435
Make you pay in kind?

38:32.436 --> 38:34.395
Jesus! Did he try it on with you?

38:34.396 --> 38:35.835
He's...just lonely.

38:35.836 --> 38:38.515
He just wanted a bit of company.

38:38.516 --> 38:41.155
What a way to live, eh?

38:41.156 --> 38:43.675
It doesn't have to be like this,
though, does it?

38:43.676 --> 38:47.675
I mean, if his family would have
just accepted him for what he was.

38:48.156 --> 38:52.155
His family rejected him?

38:52.356 --> 38:54.355
Bastards!

38:54.356 --> 38:55.715
No mates?

38:55.716 --> 38:57.915
Long gone.

38:57.916 --> 39:01.915
Address book. We should see if we can
trace any of his family.

39:01.956 --> 39:05.235
Why? Fuckers never gave a shit
when he was around.

39:05.236 --> 39:09.235
Why would they be arsed
when he's not?

39:24.396 --> 39:27.275
I didn't know Philip for long...

39:27.276 --> 39:29.515
Lulu...

39:29.516 --> 39:32.195
but I did know the pain he was in.

39:32.196 --> 39:35.875
Not because of his illness
particularly,

39:35.876 --> 39:37.755
but from the scars he carried

39:37.756 --> 39:41.755
from years of rejection
by those he held dear...

39:41.956 --> 39:43.475
..those he loved,

39:43.476 --> 39:47.475
who couldn't love him back because
of who he was.

39:48.556 --> 39:49.835
What he was.

39:49.836 --> 39:53.835
He knew that once he stood up
and said, "I am what I am,"

39:53.876 --> 39:57.235
there'd be a price to pay.

39:57.236 --> 40:01.235
Years of loneliness and isolation.

40:01.396 --> 40:05.395
His only friends, a half-witted
old woman and his doctor.

40:07.396 --> 40:09.435
You're wrong.

40:09.436 --> 40:13.435
He had the courage to live his life
his way.

40:14.396 --> 40:16.995
To die his way.

40:16.996 --> 40:19.955
A life with no compromise,

40:19.956 --> 40:22.595
with no regard for the scorn
and disappointment

40:22.596 --> 40:24.675
heaped on him by those nearest.

40:24.676 --> 40:27.115
Those who should have loved him...

40:27.116 --> 40:30.795
no matter what.

40:30.796 --> 40:32.035
What do you mean by that?

40:32.036 --> 40:33.795
You know what I'm talking about.

40:33.796 --> 40:37.555
Are you insinuating that I rejected
my own brother because he were gay?

40:37.556 --> 40:39.955
You're the one who couldn't
bear to face him for years.

40:39.956 --> 40:43.475
I had him round Christmas,
New Year, Easter, birthdays.

40:43.476 --> 40:45.275
Guilt getting to you, is it?

40:45.276 --> 40:47.075
You cheeky fucker.

40:47.076 --> 40:48.475
Get off him!

40:48.476 --> 40:52.475
Get off him!

40:57.636 --> 41:01.635
MUSIC STARTS

41:22.316 --> 41:24.515
A couple of times when
I were younger,

41:24.516 --> 41:26.835
I tried to broach the subject.

41:26.836 --> 41:30.715
But he'd have none of it.

41:30.716 --> 41:33.555
Not the story he told me.

41:33.556 --> 41:34.995
Not the story he told anyone.

41:34.996 --> 41:38.675
Disappeared in 1985.

41:38.676 --> 41:41.915
All Mam got was a postcard
saying he were living in London.

41:41.916 --> 41:44.195
Not to bother trying to find him.

41:44.196 --> 41:47.595
Your mam never liked him anyway.

41:47.596 --> 41:50.755
He were the apple of her eye.

41:50.756 --> 41:52.955
It broke her heart when he went.

41:52.956 --> 41:54.475
She used to say to me,

41:54.476 --> 41:56.675
"How come he didn't tell me?"

41:56.676 --> 42:00.195
Trust me, the thought for one
second I wouldn't love him...

42:00.196 --> 42:02.155
He said you rejected him.

42:02.156 --> 42:03.555
You all did.

42:03.556 --> 42:04.915
When we were kids,

42:04.916 --> 42:08.915
Mam saying to us, "I loved you from
the moment you entered this world.

42:09.516 --> 42:11.275
"And I'll never stop.

42:11.276 --> 42:15.275
"I'll love you for all time,
eternity."

42:15.476 --> 42:17.995
Only one who had trouble believing
that were Philip.

42:17.996 --> 42:20.955
You knew?

42:20.956 --> 42:22.435
All the time, you knew?

42:22.436 --> 42:23.915
What he were.

42:23.916 --> 42:27.315
Who he were.

42:27.316 --> 42:31.195
Didn't stop me loving him any less.

42:31.196 --> 42:35.195
Thanks for doing what you did.

42:36.356 --> 42:38.475
He hadn't even suffered anything.

42:38.476 --> 42:40.435
He was just a big lying poof.

42:40.436 --> 42:42.995
He was lying to protect himself.

42:42.996 --> 42:44.035
You think so?

42:44.036 --> 42:45.715
It was himself he couldn't face.

42:45.716 --> 42:47.075
That's what his brother said.

42:47.076 --> 42:48.355
And he's right.

42:48.356 --> 42:49.635
How sad is that?

42:49.636 --> 42:52.315
You're better off saying,
aren't you, really?

42:52.316 --> 42:54.315
Just summon up the courage and say,

42:54.316 --> 42:58.315
"A life lived lying is like
a life half-lived."

43:01.316 --> 43:05.315
Honestyisthe best policy.

43:07.356 --> 43:08.995
Though I've got to admit,

43:08.996 --> 43:12.155
I'd fuckin' freak if it was one of
mine, do you know what I mean?

43:12.156 --> 43:13.195
Too right.

43:13.196 --> 43:14.635
I'd spend the rest of me life

43:14.636 --> 43:17.075
wondering what the fuck
I'd done wrong.

43:17.076 --> 43:20.675
I mean, is it genetic,
something they learn?

43:20.676 --> 43:22.955
What makes a lad like cock?

43:22.956 --> 43:25.715
I mean, apart from his own, like.

43:25.716 --> 43:26.955
And arses.

43:26.956 --> 43:30.955
Could never get me head round that.

43:36.396 --> 43:38.315
Dusty?

43:38.316 --> 43:40.075
Dusty!

43:40.076 --> 43:44.075
Dusty?

43:46.356 --> 43:48.915
Dusty!

43:48.916 --> 43:52.915
Pss, pss, pss!

43:54.156 --> 43:57.715
She'll be out on the prowl somewhere.

43:57.716 --> 44:00.195
Dusty!

44:00.196 --> 44:04.195
Pss, pss, pss, pss, pss.

44:05.636 --> 44:06.955
Where is she?

44:06.956 --> 44:09.035
You fuckin'...

44:09.036 --> 44:12.675
Fuck off with that Billy Casper
routine.

44:12.676 --> 44:13.715
What have you done with his cat?

44:13.716 --> 44:16.755
Why are you sofuckin' bothered?
It was just a cat.

44:16.756 --> 44:20.595
It was his cat.

44:20.596 --> 44:22.395
You haven't?

44:22.396 --> 44:25.035
Fuck's sake, Shane, you haven't?

44:25.036 --> 44:27.595
Haven't what?

44:27.596 --> 44:28.795
Haven't what?

44:28.796 --> 44:32.275
It was sat on Cilla's face.
What the fuck am I supposed to do?

44:32.276 --> 44:33.715
Leave her?

44:33.716 --> 44:36.955
Where is she?

44:36.956 --> 44:40.955
In the bin...where she belongs.

44:45.356 --> 44:49.355
You bastard, Shane,
you fuckin' bastard.

45:12.956 --> 45:15.075
'They say I got a lot of water
in my brain.

45:15.076 --> 45:18.875
'Got no common sense.

45:18.876 --> 45:20.595
'I got nobody left to believe in.

45:20.596 --> 45:24.595
'I used to think Freddie was singing
about me when I heard that.

45:24.916 --> 45:28.595
'But I know I have.

45:28.596 --> 45:32.595
'And I know they're out there,
just waiting for me.

45:35.076 --> 45:36.875
'All I have to do...

45:36.876 --> 45:40.515
'is find them.'

45:40.516 --> 45:41.435
Jenny Taylor.

45:41.436 --> 45:43.475
Jenny's going to be your carer.

45:43.476 --> 45:46.995
If you walk out that door, you won't
be allowed back. I mean it.

45:46.996 --> 45:47.995
Why do this?

45:47.996 --> 45:49.235
I need someone.

45:49.236 --> 45:50.755
You've got me.

45:50.756 --> 45:51.715
Parents, eh? Can't live with them...

45:51.716 --> 45:54.635
And you can't kill them!

45:54.636 --> 45:56.075
I can't do that. I just run things.

45:56.076 --> 45:59.235
Fuck off or you fuck off.

45:59.236 --> 46:01.315
She's drugging me.

46:01.316 --> 46:05.235
This rope's too tight.

46:05.236 --> 46:09.235
Marry me.

46:48.236 --> 46:50.395
Would you like me to be the cat?

46:50.396 --> 46:53.315
Yes, please. Don't be frightened.

46:53.316 --> 46:57.315
(PURRS)

46:58.316 --> 47:02.315
Here's some milk.
You like that, don't you?
