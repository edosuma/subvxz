15:14.955 --> 15:16.540
I can see you're thirsty.

15:22.796 --> 15:23.881
What's your name?

15:28.594 --> 15:29.678
Jibril Hassan.

15:31.513 --> 15:33.390
Well, Jibril Hassan...

15:35.309 --> 15:36.769
I have some questions for you...

15:36.852 --> 15:39.104
and hopefully you have
some answers for me.

15:41.273 --> 15:42.358
Last night...

15:42.942 --> 15:44.526
at the edge of your camp...

15:44.610 --> 15:46.612
you met someone from...

15:47.863 --> 15:48.781
Nazareth.

15:49.865 --> 15:50.783
No?

15:51.992 --> 15:52.868
Yes.

15:55.621 --> 15:56.914
Palestinian?

15:57.957 --> 15:58.832
Yes.

16:05.839 --> 16:06.674
Why?

16:08.926 --> 16:10.094
She gave me food.

16:10.552 --> 16:11.387
She...

16:16.684 --> 16:18.435
What did she ask you to do?

16:20.354 --> 16:21.814
Nothing.

16:21.897 --> 16:22.982
She just wanted to help.

16:23.065 --> 16:25.192
We have nothing.
People are getting sick.

16:26.026 --> 16:27.444
People are getting sick?

16:30.698 --> 16:32.282
People are getting killed.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.660
A war has started...

16:35.244 --> 16:36.662
because of your friend.

16:38.497 --> 16:39.665
Your leader.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.044
Where is he?

16:44.461 --> 16:45.713
I don't know.

16:48.674 --> 16:49.717
Where is he?

16:50.426 --> 16:52.428
I'm telling you, I don't know.

16:53.554 --> 16:56.974
You really should stop
saying, "I don't know."

16:57.558 --> 16:59.268
He was arrested. That's it.

17:00.936 --> 17:01.812
The girl?

17:02.771 --> 17:04.189
-Did she say where he is?
-No.

17:05.107 --> 17:05.983
No?

17:23.167 --> 17:24.168
Your leader.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.172
What's his name?

17:33.260 --> 17:34.261
al-Masih.

17:36.096 --> 17:37.598
That's not a real name.

17:38.974 --> 17:40.392
What's his real name?

17:43.937 --> 17:45.105
What's his name?

17:45.647 --> 17:46.648
What's his name?

17:47.441 --> 17:49.443
I swear I don't know.

17:49.943 --> 17:52.738
No one knows anything about this man,

17:52.821 --> 17:54.615
and yet they risk their lives

17:55.199 --> 17:57.117
and trek across deserts for him.

17:57.993 --> 17:59.078
Why?

18:01.455 --> 18:02.623
Why?

18:07.086 --> 18:09.088
Because he is sent from God.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.301
Say that again.

18:17.554 --> 18:18.680
Say that <i>again.</i>

18:21.934 --> 18:23.936
He is sent from God.

18:27.564 --> 18:29.650
I want to prove something to you...

18:29.817 --> 18:30.984
Jibril Hassan.

18:50.337 --> 18:51.713
I want to prove to you...

18:53.799 --> 18:55.509
that there is no God.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.640
Our Lord, give us goodness
in this world...

31:56.456 --> 31:57.957
Morning, princess.

31:59.083 --> 32:00.001
What's this?

32:00.585 --> 32:02.503
I don't want you to be cold out here.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.174
Thank you.

32:07.383 --> 32:10.386
Now I will stay nice and warm. Thank you.

32:11.012 --> 32:14.098
Daddy, why are you sleeping in your car?

32:17.268 --> 32:18.603
Well...

32:19.395 --> 32:22.732
I had to work...

32:24.192 --> 32:30.156
I had to work late last night,
but I wanted to see you.

32:33.034 --> 32:35.286
Daddy, you're hurt.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.586
Don't come outside like that
without telling me, understand?

32:47.757 --> 32:50.885
Why can't Daddy come inside?

32:52.220 --> 32:55.223
Oh, Ellie,
Daddy doesn't live here anymore.
