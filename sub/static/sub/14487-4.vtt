No, you don't, 'cause
I lost me real hand

10:49.620 --> 10:52.344
planting the flag
when we took back Haley's Comet.

10:52.413 --> 10:56.447
Yet it was worth it--
so much do I love that flag.

10:56.517 --> 10:58.517
Aw...[ sniffling]

10:58.586 --> 11:01.447
I love it even more
than I love my seven wives.

11:01.517 --> 11:03.586
That's right, I'm a polygamist.

11:03.654 --> 11:05.413
[ all booing]

11:05.481 --> 11:07.965
Yet I would gladly
eat a flag myself--

11:08.033 --> 11:10.551
had I not used my intestine
as a rope

11:10.620 --> 11:13.240
to hoist a flag
made of my own skin--

11:13.309 --> 11:16.758
if it would protect the freedoms
of the proud people

11:16.826 --> 11:18.379
who salute that flag.

11:18.447 --> 11:20.481
[ cheering]

11:20.551 --> 11:22.240
Freedoms such as polygamy.

11:22.309 --> 11:23.895
[ booing]

11:23.965 --> 11:25.447
I rest my case.

11:25.517 --> 11:26.758
[ clunking]

11:26.826 --> 11:28.067
Whoa, geez.

11:28.136 --> 11:30.931
The Justices and I
will now confer

11:31.000 --> 11:33.481
using high-speed telepathy.

11:36.965 --> 11:38.895
[ electrical buzzing]

11:42.826 --> 11:45.206
[ electrical buzzing continues]

11:47.309 --> 11:49.033
[ electrical buzzing stops]

11:50.447 --> 11:54.379
By a vote of six to three,
we find that flag-eating

11:54.447 --> 11:57.240
is notprotected
by the Constitution.

11:57.309 --> 11:58.517
[ all gasping]

11:58.586 --> 12:01.586
Six to three?
I beat the spread.

12:01.654 --> 12:04.793
The court orders
an immediate public apology.

12:04.861 --> 12:06.000
Apology accepted.

12:06.067 --> 12:08.447
Just don't let it happen again.

12:08.517 --> 12:10.586
She means you,
you turkey of the sea.

12:10.654 --> 12:13.067
Me, apologize? Never!

12:13.136 --> 12:16.240
I came to this planet to learn
the meaning of freedom!

12:16.309 --> 12:19.206
But I say it's you
who should get a nice lesson!

12:19.274 --> 12:22.620
So, do your worst, because
no punishment could be bigger

12:22.688 --> 12:24.447
than denying me my freedom!

12:24.517 --> 12:27.551
You are hereby sentenced
to death.

12:27.620 --> 12:28.826
Wait, let me finish!

12:28.895 --> 12:30.793
[ shocked murmuring]

12:30.861 --> 12:33.517
Also, in a rare
double-whammy decision

12:33.586 --> 12:36.654
the court finds polygamy
constitutional.

12:36.724 --> 12:38.344
[ booing]

12:38.413 --> 12:40.447
I can't wait to tell my husband.

12:40.517 --> 12:42.793

ZAPP BRANNIGAN:
Remember, men

12:44.517 --> 12:47.447
take him alive, so there's
something left to kill.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.481
[ pounding]

12:49.551 --> 12:51.413
Stay back!

12:51.481 --> 12:55.931
This Embassy is sovereign mud
of the mud planet Decapod 10.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.274
Invading these mud premises
is an act of war!

12:59.344 --> 13:02.481
Yeah? Well, what are you going
to do about it, shrimpy?

13:02.551 --> 13:05.654
You want to see, Mr. Bigshot?

13:05.724 --> 13:06.931
Attack Earth!

13:07.000 --> 13:10.309
Yes, I know it's a shlep--
just do it!

13:16.758 --> 13:18.724
[ engines roaring]

13:21.000 --> 13:24.551
Haha! Now the rubber band's
on the other claw!

13:24.620 --> 13:27.274
[ terrified screaming]

13:27.344 --> 13:30.274
Ready? Retreat!

Shh!

13:54.895 --> 13:57.654
[ people screaming softly
and whimpering]

13:57.724 --> 14:00.826
DR. ZOIDBERG:
Deny my freedom, will you?

14:00.895 --> 14:02.309
Well, we'll do to you

14:02.379 --> 14:05.172
what we did to the Squash Men
of the Squash Planet--

14:05.240 --> 14:06.344
squish them!

14:06.413 --> 14:07.620
[ chuckling]

14:07.688 --> 14:08.620
Charleston Chew?

14:08.688 --> 14:09.620
You bet.

[ heroic music plays]

14:15.586 --> 14:17.517
ZAPP:
All right, Kif

14:17.586 --> 14:19.309
let's show
these freaks

14:19.379 --> 14:22.965
what a bloated, runaway
military budget can do.

14:23.033 --> 14:25.931
Bring me the activation codes
for our global defense network.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.481
Aye, aye, sir.

14:27.551 --> 14:29.136

[ hissing]

14:44.033 --> 14:46.067
[ kissing]:
Mmm...

14:46.136 --> 14:48.379
We can't be too careful
with these codes.

14:48.447 --> 14:50.136
Rumor has it,
a double agent

14:50.206 --> 14:51.895
may be aboard
this very ship.

14:51.965 --> 14:54.309
I'm watching you.

14:54.379 --> 14:56.172
You, Ensign,
what's your name?

14:56.240 --> 14:57.586
Hugh Mann, sir.

14:57.654 --> 14:58.861
Hugh Mann.

14:58.931 --> 15:00.586
Now, that's a name
I can trust.

15:00.654 --> 15:02.517
Run down to the central
battle computer

15:02.586 --> 15:04.172
and enter these codes,
chop-chop.

15:07.067 --> 15:09.724
KIF:
Uh, sir, there's something
about that Ensign...

15:09.793 --> 15:11.000
ZAPP:
You're damn right there is.

15:11.067 --> 15:14.033
That strapping young lad's
gunning for your job

15:14.102 --> 15:16.344
and he just might get it.

for another medal.

I'm going clubbing later.

15:32.206 --> 15:35.067
Sir, all planetary defenses
have been disabled.

15:35.136 --> 15:38.067
Perhaps the Decapodians
acquired our secret codes.

15:38.136 --> 15:39.481
Somehow.

15:39.551 --> 15:42.102
Well, Kif,
stand by to take the blame.

16:05.586 --> 16:07.344
how can you claim
to love freedom

16:07.413 --> 16:09.033
and then enslave all of Earth?

16:09.102 --> 16:11.136
Bah! Your planet
doesn't deserve freedom

16:11.206 --> 16:13.620
until it learns what it is
to not have freedom.

16:13.688 --> 16:15.172
It's a lesson, I say.

16:16.102 --> 16:17.447
Ow!

16:17.517 --> 16:19.861
What the hell is this dirt pile
we're building, anyhow?

16:19.931 --> 16:21.826
None of your
beeswax, slave.

16:21.895 --> 16:23.758
You'll find out
soon enough.

16:23.826 --> 16:26.000

at being a slave.

to kill each other just fine.

take out an entire army.

Oppression Palace

He defended my freedom
when no one else would.

He was a good
and honorable man.

to even go to a museum

stand to hug you.
