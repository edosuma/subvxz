You're doing fine.
No, he isn't.

38:39.275 --> 38:40.776
We're coming up
on them too fast.

38:49.494 --> 38:53.080
Lieutenant,
our relative velocity
is too great.

38:53.164 --> 38:56.041
Unless you can match
our speed, you're gonna
crash into the ship.

38:56.126 --> 38:57.334
This is all we've got.

38:59.546 --> 39:02.006
lt's coming up
pretty fast on us !
l know, l know, l know.

39:02.090 --> 39:03.257
We have to come left!

39:03.466 --> 39:04.717
A little this way,
Lieutenant.

39:04.801 --> 39:06.885
What we need is more speed .

39:06.970 --> 39:08.846
Fire maneuvering thrusters.

39:08.930 --> 39:10.389
That might just
make the difference.

39:10.765 --> 39:12.266
Right.

39:25.989 --> 39:27.906

YOU NG : You just said
it was like an arm .
That's what you said .

40:16.831 --> 40:18.332
But l'm dead
serious about it.
lt was like. . .

40:18.416 --> 40:21.585
That was the worst
shuttle docking l have
ever seen in my life.

40:21.669 --> 40:23.462
What are you talking about?
l barely even dented it!

40:23.546 --> 40:25.047
The grinding noise !

40:25.131 --> 40:28.592
At the very least,
there is a giant scrape
along the bottom .

40:28.676 --> 40:31.762
l'm gonna make you put on
a space suit, go out there,
fix it right now.

40:31.846 --> 40:32.846
Sergeant, we're gonna
need some of that

40:44.609 --> 40:47.569
No, thanks.
Come on ,
we should celebrate.

40:47.654 --> 40:50.072
Celebrate what?
That we're back

He deserves it.

Why's that, then?

You were right about
the power situation .

41:16.015 --> 41:17.057
Not really.

41:17.142 --> 41:20.519
You figured out the
subspace communications,
how to call the shuttle.

41:21.521 --> 41:23.313
We needed to get
those supplies back.

41:23.398 --> 41:24.898
You took your name
out of the lottery.

So did you .

41:29.070 --> 41:31.947

You actually made
a sacrifice.
