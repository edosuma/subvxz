SMOKE I FELT LIKE I WAS GETTING

10:22.166 --> 10:24.300
MORE EXERCISE THAN THE BASEBALL

THAT TO YOU.

11:00.566 --> 11:01.800
WHOEVER IS ON STAGE WITH YOU IS

11:40.200 --> 11:42.466
YOU ALWAYS ARE COMPLAINING

11:42.533 --> 11:43.766

11:43.833 --> 11:44.966
LEAN ON THAT ANYMORE, YOU ARE

11:50.966 --> 11:52.533
GOING TO TAKE IT ALL IN TAXES

11:52.600 --> 11:54.000
SPIRIT WHEN I SAW THAT I'VE

11:54.066 --> 11:55.266
ALWAYS BEEN ADVOCATING FOR THIS

11:55.333 --> 11:57.000
AND I WAS LIKE NOT THIS YEAR,

11:57.066 --> 11:59.500
DON'T DO IT THIS YEAR.

11:59.566 --> 12:00.766

12:00.833 --> 12:04.633
YOU WHEN YOU WERE A CABBIE, YOU

12:04.700 --> 12:05.300
WERE IN THE 70s?

12:05.366 --> 12:08.466
>> I WASN'T IN MY 70s.

12:08.533 --> 12:08.933
>> Bill: IN THE 70s.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.033
>> THAT'S A SADDER FATE, I WAS

12:13.100 --> 12:13.933
LIKE 21.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.800
>> Bill: ONE TO ONE OF ONLY

12:16.866 --> 12:17.066
TWO WOMEN?

12:17.133 --> 12:18.200
>> SUPPOSEDLY BUT I NEVER SAW

12:18.266 --> 12:19.600
THE OTHER ONE, I THOUGHT THE

12:19.666 --> 12:21.533
OTHER ONE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A

12:21.600 --> 12:22.100
MYTH.

12:22.166 --> 12:22.766
TRUTHFULLY I WASN'T REALLY A

12:22.833 --> 12:25.266
WOMAN, I WAS A GIRL, I WAS A

12:25.333 --> 12:25.666
KID.

12:25.733 --> 12:27.533
I DON'T MEAN I WASN'T A WOMAN IN

12:27.600 --> 12:32.533
THE WAY THAT -- WHATEVER HE'S

12:32.600 --> 12:33.033
CALLED, CAITLYN JENNER.

12:33.100 --> 12:33.533
>> Bill: I'M PROBABLY IN

12:33.600 --> 12:36.700
ENOUGH TROUBLE ON THAT ONE.

12:36.766 --> 12:39.066
>> I WAS A GIRL, I WAS A KID AND

12:39.133 --> 12:40.866
I KEPT HEARING THERE WAS ANOTHER

12:40.933 --> 12:42.300
WOMAN CABDRIVER BUT I NEVER SAW

12:42.366 --> 12:43.100
HER, I LOOKED FOR HER BECAUSE

12:43.166 --> 12:47.633
THE MEN CABDRIVERS WOULDN'T TALK

12:47.700 --> 12:47.866
TO ME.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.333
>> Bill: IT MUST'VE BEEN A

12:49.400 --> 12:51.966
ROUGH GIG BUT YOU HAVE A DEEP

12:52.033 --> 12:53.000
LOVE OF CABBIES BECAUSE YOU

12:53.066 --> 12:55.466
BOUGHT A CAB, THE DO NOT?

12:55.533 --> 12:57.800
YOU BOUGHT A CHECKERED CAB?

12:57.866 --> 12:59.633
THAT'S AN ODD THING FOR SOMEONE

12:59.700 --> 13:00.966
TO DO ESPECIALLY WAS PENNILESS.

13:01.033 --> 13:03.000
>> I WASN'T PENNILESS WHEN I

13:03.066 --> 13:05.500
BOUGHT IT.

13:05.566 --> 13:07.766
AFTER I BOUGHT IT I WAS

13:07.833 --> 13:09.100
PENNILESS.

13:09.166 --> 13:13.466
I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE THE CHECKER

13:13.533 --> 13:14.033
COMPANY MADE A PASSENGER CAR

13:14.100 --> 13:15.966
CALLED A MARATHON IN THE SHAPE

13:16.033 --> 13:16.833
OF A CAB.

13:16.900 --> 13:18.666
I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE I WANTED TO

13:18.733 --> 13:20.333
BUY AN OLD BENTLEY AND I

13:20.400 --> 13:23.133
COULDN'T AFFORD IT.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.266
SO EVERYONE SAID THIS CAR KIND

13:24.333 --> 13:25.533
OF LOOKS LIKE AN OLD BENTLEY

13:25.600 --> 13:27.966
WHICH IT KIND OF DOES, IT'S

13:28.033 --> 13:28.166
ROUND.

13:28.233 --> 13:29.466
THEY NEVER CHANGE THE DESIGN,

13:29.533 --> 13:32.766
THE BODY DESIGN.

13:32.833 --> 13:34.766
>> Bill: WHO TOLD YOU THIS?

13:34.833 --> 13:36.800
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

13:36.866 --> 13:37.333
IF [LAUGHTER]

13:37.400 --> 13:39.133
>> I LIKE THE WAY IT LOOKS, IT

13:39.200 --> 13:41.666
LOOKED LIKE A COMIC BOOK CAR.

13:41.733 --> 13:42.866
>> Bill: IT DOES.

13:42.933 --> 13:43.633
IF THAT'S WHAT IT DOES LOOK

13:43.700 --> 13:44.300
LIKE.

13:44.366 --> 13:45.433
>> YOU EXPECT THE FAMILY OF

13:45.500 --> 13:48.466
DUCKS TO GET OUT OF IT.

13:48.533 --> 13:49.266
ANYWAY, I STILL HAVE THE CAR.

13:49.333 --> 13:51.033
>> Bill: YOU DO?

13:51.100 --> 13:59.166
DO YOU EVER TAKE UBER?

13:59.233 --> 14:01.066
>> IF SOMEONE ELSE TAKES IT, I

14:01.133 --> 14:01.933
DON'T HAVE A PHONE, YOU NEED A

14:02.000 --> 14:04.100
PHONE TO GET UBER.

14:04.166 --> 14:06.066
>> Bill: I TAKE IT VERY RARELY

14:06.133 --> 14:09.566
BUT THE LAST TIME I TOOK ONE, IT

14:09.633 --> 14:13.266
SAID THE THING CAME UP AND THEY

14:13.333 --> 14:13.600
HAVE A SCREEN.

14:13.666 --> 14:16.633
>> I TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT.

14:16.700 --> 14:19.266
>> Bill: IT'S SAID DO YOU WANT

14:19.333 --> 14:19.866
CONVERSATION WITH THE DRIVER?

14:19.933 --> 14:22.100
I HAD TO PICK THAT BEFORE.

14:22.166 --> 14:25.600
I WAS LIKE COULD WE JUST WING

14:25.666 --> 14:25.833
IT?

14:25.900 --> 14:27.233
I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT YOU

14:27.300 --> 14:29.966
THINK ABOUT THAT GENERATIONS

14:30.033 --> 14:31.400
FRAGILITY THAT THEY CAN'T EVEN

14:31.466 --> 14:33.966
GET INTO A CAR WITHOUT KNOWING

14:34.033 --> 14:37.133
WHAT'S COMING.

14:37.200 --> 14:39.800
THERE'S TRIGGER WARNINGS OUTSIDE

14:39.866 --> 14:40.666
OF BROADWAY SHOWS NOW.

14:40.733 --> 14:42.600

14:43.100 --> 14:47.833
>> Bill: THERE ARE.

14:47.900 --> 14:49.800
>> YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE THIS?

14:49.866 --> 14:50.633
DIDN'T YOU SEE THIS 40 YEARS AGO

14:50.700 --> 14:54.600
WHEN IT FIRST OPENED?

14:54.666 --> 14:55.666
[LAUGHTER]

14:55.733 --> 14:56.700
>> Bill: WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU

14:56.766 --> 14:58.533
WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE IF YOU HAD

14:58.600 --> 15:00.866
TEXTING WHEN YOU WERE A TEENAGER

15:00.933 --> 15:01.866
AS TEENAGERS DO TODAY?

15:01.933 --> 15:03.766
BECAUSE YOU ARE SO LITERATE.

15:03.833 --> 15:04.866
COULDN'T YOU HAVE LIKE -- WOULD

15:04.933 --> 15:08.133
THAT HAVE BEEN GOOD FOR YOU?

15:08.200 --> 15:09.333
>> TRUTHFULLY, THE IDEA THAT I

15:09.400 --> 15:10.866
WOULD EVER WANT TO SIT THERE AND

15:10.933 --> 15:11.733
WRITE ALL DAY LONG FOR FREE IS

15:11.800 --> 15:15.233
OUT OF THE QUESTION.

15:15.300 --> 15:16.866
[LAUGHTER]

15:16.933 --> 15:18.033
>> Bill: THAT IS TWEETING.

15:18.100 --> 15:20.100
>> BUT TEXTING IS RIDING.

15:20.166 --> 15:21.566
>> Bill: BUT IT'S TO A PERSON,

15:21.633 --> 15:23.066
WOULDN'T THAT HAVE CHANGED YOUR

15:23.133 --> 15:23.500
LOVE LIFE?

15:23.566 --> 15:25.700
>> ALL RIDING IS TO A PERSON OR

15:25.766 --> 15:26.000
SOME PEOPLE.

15:26.066 --> 15:27.433
>> Bill: I FEEL LIKE IT

15:27.500 --> 15:28.000
WOULD'VE BEEN GOOD FOR ME

15:28.066 --> 15:31.266
BECAUSE I WAS VERY SHY.

15:31.333 --> 15:31.933
BUT I WAS SINCERE IN ALL, SAY

15:32.000 --> 15:34.866
THE RIGHT THING BUT I HAD THE

15:34.933 --> 15:37.566
BIG NOSE.

15:37.633 --> 15:41.266
SO I DIDN'T WANT TO.

15:41.333 --> 15:45.633
>> BUT VERY STRAIGHT.

15:45.700 --> 15:46.500
>> Bill: LAST QUESTION ABOUT

15:46.566 --> 15:48.233
THE PANDEMIC, DID IT MAKE YOU

15:48.300 --> 15:50.133
THINK --

15:57.366 --> 15:57.466
SAY?

15:57.533 --> 15:59.033
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER.

15:59.100 --> 15:59.666
>> Bill: DID IT MAKE YOU

15:59.733 --> 16:02.166
PONDER THE BIG QUESTIONS?

16:02.233 --> 16:05.266
IT DID WITH ME.

>> DID WHAT?

16:07.533 --> 16:09.733
>> Bill: MAKE ME THINK ABOUT

16:09.800 --> 16:11.400
THINGS.

16:11.466 --> 16:11.666
>> WHAT?

16:11.733 --> 16:11.933
I MEAN --

16:12.000 --> 16:12.400
>> Bill: THE PANDEMIC.

16:12.466 --> 16:17.566
DID YOU SEE RECENTLY THEY SAID

16:17.633 --> 16:18.100
UFOs, THE FIRST TIME THE

16:18.166 --> 16:19.533
GOVERNMENT IS TALKING ABOUT HOW

YES, THERE ARE THESE THINGS THAT

16:20.466 --> 16:24.133
OUR PILOTS ARE SEEN, THESE ARE

16:24.200 --> 16:26.300
NOT CRAZY PEOPLE, PEOPLE IN THE

16:26.366 --> 16:26.566
MILITARY.

16:26.633 --> 16:31.066
THEY'VE SEEN THESE THINGS, AND

16:31.133 --> 16:32.233
THEY CAN'T EXPLAIN --

16:32.300 --> 16:34.066
>> I CAN, IT'S THE DELTA FLIGHT

16:34.133 --> 16:36.466
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO LEAVE THREE

16:36.533 --> 16:37.666
DAYS AGO.

[LAUGHTER]

16:38.000 --> 16:38.200
[APPLAUSE]

16:38.266 --> 16:39.400

16:39.466 --> 16:41.300
PRETTY REAL, SOME OF THEM SAY IT

16:41.366 --> 16:42.866
COULD BE ANOTHER COUNTRY,

16:42.933 --> 16:44.000
ANOTHER COUNTRY THAT HAS THE

16:44.066 --> 16:45.166
STUFF THAT IS AS THEY SAY, THE

16:45.233 --> 16:47.666
MILITARY IS SAYING BEHAVING IN

16:47.733 --> 16:50.300
WAYS WE CAN'T EXPLAIN?

16:50.366 --> 16:51.666
VIOLATING LAWS OF PHYSICS WE

16:51.733 --> 16:52.700
CAN'T EXPLAIN?

16:52.766 --> 16:55.533
WHAT OTHER COUNTRY HAS GOT THAT?

16:55.600 --> 16:57.466
>> I'M SURE I BEHAVE IN WAYS THE

MILITARY CANNOT EXPLAIN.

17:00.366 --> 17:01.066

17:34.733 --> 17:35.266
WHAT ACTUAL PHYSICS IS AND I

17:35.333 --> 17:38.833
STILL DON'T KNOW.

17:38.900 --> 17:41.000
I DON'T HAVE OPINIONS ABOUT THE

17:41.066 --> 17:41.366
BIG BANG THEORY.

17:41.433 --> 17:41.966
>> Bill: I'M GOING TO TELL YOU

17:42.033 --> 17:44.300
WHAT IT IS AND YOU CAN TELL ME

17:44.366 --> 17:44.633
YOUR OPINION.

17:44.700 --> 17:46.366
THIS IS THE BIG BANG THEORY:

17:46.433 --> 17:48.733
THAT THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE AT ONE

17:48.800 --> 17:49.366
TIME FIT IN THE SOMETHING THE

17:49.433 --> 17:52.333
SIZE OF A MARBLE.

17:52.400 --> 17:55.500
PICTURE THE EARTH CONDENSED TO

17:55.566 --> 17:57.333
BE IN A MARBLE, NOT JUST THE

17:57.400 --> 17:58.566
EARTH, THE SON AND ALL OF OUR

17:58.633 --> 18:00.500
PLANETS AND NOT JUST THAT BUT

18:00.566 --> 18:01.266
THE ENTIRE GALAXY WHICH IS A

18:01.333 --> 18:05.000
HUNDRED BILLION STARS AND THEN

18:05.066 --> 18:07.866
THERE IS 2 TRILLION GALAXIES,

18:07.933 --> 18:09.433
NOW IT'S GETTING CROWDED IN

18:09.500 --> 18:11.966
THERE.

18:12.033 --> 18:12.233
[LAUGHTER]

18:12.300 --> 18:17.433
AND THAT EXPLODED.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.366
>> AND IS IN ITS PRESENT

18:19.433 --> 18:20.300
CONDITION, WHERE THEY STILL

18:20.366 --> 18:22.700
DOING CONSTRUCTION NEXT TO MY

18:22.766 --> 18:23.933
HOTEL?

18:24.000 --> 18:25.833
>> Bill: THAT HAPPENED

18:25.900 --> 18:27.100
14 BILLION YEARS AGO, THEN THE

18:27.166 --> 18:28.866
SHIT COOLED AND PLANETS FORMED,

18:28.933 --> 18:31.466
COME ON, YOU KNOW.

18:31.533 --> 18:32.833
>> YOU'RE ASKING ME IF I AGREE

18:32.900 --> 18:35.833
WITH THIS?

18:35.900 --> 18:37.533
[LAUGHTER]

18:37.600 --> 18:39.633
>> Bill: YES!

18:39.700 --> 18:42.133
>> NOT A SINGLE THING YOU SAID

18:42.200 --> 18:42.733
COULD I FOLLOW.

18:42.800 --> 18:43.900
>> Bill: THE WHOLE UNIVERSE

18:43.966 --> 18:44.866
BUT IN THE SOMETHING LITTLE AND

18:44.933 --> 18:46.933
IT EXPLODED AND SHIT HAPPEN FOR

18:47.000 --> 18:49.033
LOT OF YEARS AND YES, THAT IS

18:49.100 --> 18:50.133
WHAT ALL THE SMARTEST PEOPLE IN

18:50.200 --> 18:52.000
THE WORLD THINK.

18:52.066 --> 18:54.100
I AGREE WITH THEM BECAUSE I

18:54.166 --> 18:55.500
REALIZE THEY ARE SMARTER THAN

18:55.566 --> 18:56.866
ME.

18:56.933 --> 18:59.266
BUT IT DOESN'T SOUND STUPIDER

18:59.333 --> 19:00.366
THAN VIRGIN BIRTH ON THE

19:00.433 --> 19:00.600
SURFACE.

19:00.666 --> 19:03.633
I'M NOT SAYING IT -- IT'S

19:03.700 --> 19:04.900
COUNTERINTUITIVE.

19:04.966 --> 19:08.566
>> IT'S MORE PICTURESQUE.

19:08.633 --> 19:10.833
I DON'T UNDERSTAND EITHER ONE OF

19:10.900 --> 19:11.033
THEM.

19:11.100 --> 19:12.766
>> Bill: ALL RIGHT, YOU ARE

19:12.833 --> 19:14.533
GOING TO BE THE BIGGEST STAR OF

>> I DON'T KNOW.

19:23.300 --> 19:24.000
>> Bill: YOU'RE GOING TO BE

19:24.066 --> 19:30.333
THE BIGGEST STAR ON CAMPUS.

20:33.766 --> 20:37.300
HAPPY MOOD AND TALK ABOUT THE

20:37.366 --> 20:38.066
HORRIBLE TRIAL.

20:38.133 --> 20:39.133
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

20:39.200 --> 20:42.866
THIS VERDICT AS IF IT'S THE

20:42.933 --> 20:45.033
BEGINNING, I JUST WANT TO SAY

20:45.100 --> 20:45.933
THE LEFT LOVES ITS NARRATIVES,

20:46.000 --> 20:47.233
ET CETERA THE PART OF A TREND

20:47.300 --> 20:50.866
THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE

20:50.933 --> 20:52.166
2014.

20:52.233 --> 20:52.800
IN CHICAGO, THE COP WHO KILLED

20:52.866 --> 20:56.400
LAQUAN McDONALD WENT TO

20:56.466 --> 20:58.233
PRISON, SIX YEARS, NINE MONTHS

20:58.300 --> 20:59.666
PERIOD OF 2015 CHARLESTON, THE

20:59.733 --> 21:00.600
GUY WHO KILLED WALTER SCOTT GOT

21:00.666 --> 21:04.500
20 YEARS IN PRISON.

21:04.566 --> 21:07.000
2017, THE COP WHO SHOT INTO A

21:07.066 --> 21:09.233
CAR FILLED WITH BLACK TEENAGERS

21:09.300 --> 21:11.433
GOT 15 YEARS, AMBER GEIGER IN

21:11.500 --> 21:15.133
DALLAS 2018, TEN YEARS IN PRISO

21:15.200 --> 21:15.366
PRISON.

21:15.433 --> 21:17.666
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN

21:17.733 --> 21:18.300
CHANGING.

21:18.366 --> 21:19.833
THIS IS ANOTHER BRICK IN THAT

21:19.900 --> 21:20.866
WALL THAT WE ARE BUILDING.

21:20.933 --> 21:23.566
>> IT'S TOO SLOW.

21:23.633 --> 21:23.933
IT'S VERY SLOW.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.900
[APPLAUSE]

21:26.966 --> 21:29.000
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A TREND

21:29.066 --> 21:29.900
SINCE 2014, LET'S GO WAY BACK.

21:29.966 --> 21:35.000
LET'S GO BACK 402 YEARS TO

21:35.066 --> 21:35.566
SLAVERY.

21:35.633 --> 21:37.033
FROM PATROLLING, THEN YOU GO TO

21:37.100 --> 21:38.533
JIM CROW, THEN YOU GO TO CIVIL

21:38.600 --> 21:40.900
RIGHTS, THEN YOU GO TODAY.

21:40.966 --> 21:41.900
THIS IS NOT EVEN A VICTORY, THIS

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
IS A SMALL MOVEMENT TOWARDS WHAT

21:46.066 --> 21:49.600
SHOULD BE -- IT'S NOT RIGHT THAT

21:49.666 --> 21:51.200
BLACK PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE THE

21:51.266 --> 21:53.633
TALK TO THEIR CHILDREN.

21:53.700 --> 21:55.133
AS A MOTHER OF BLACK GIRLS, IT'S

21:55.200 --> 21:58.233
NOT JUST ABOUT -- I HAVE TO TALK

21:58.300 --> 21:59.033
TO MY CHILDREN ABOUT WHEN YOU

21:59.100 --> 22:03.000
ARE OUT ON THE ROAD.

22:03.066 --> 22:03.600
THERE ARE DIFFERENT RULES AND

22:03.666 --> 22:07.166
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS A

22:07.233 --> 22:08.933
SCENARIO THAT WHEN BLACK PEOPLE,

22:09.000 --> 22:10.866
A LOT OF BLACK PEOPLE ARE OUT IN

22:10.933 --> 22:11.633
THE STREET, THEY FEAR POLICE

22:11.700 --> 22:14.533
COMING TO THEM AND THEY ARE

22:14.600 --> 22:17.933
FEARFUL OF WHAT STREET CORNER

22:18.000 --> 22:18.933
JUSTICE YOUR TRIED AND CONVICTED

22:19.000 --> 22:20.366
AND KILLED ON THE SPOT VERSUS A

22:20.433 --> 22:21.000
WHITE PERSON WHO GETS A CHANCE

22:21.066 --> 22:25.133
TO GO TO COURT.

22:25.200 --> 22:25.400
[LAUGHTER]

22:25.466 --> 22:30.066
[APPLAUSE]

22:30.133 --> 22:33.866
>> Bill: NO ONE'S ARGUING THAT

22:33.933 --> 22:34.500
THAT, THINGS ARE DIFFERENT FROM

22:34.566 --> 22:36.466
FIVE YEARS AGO AND IT'S

22:36.533 --> 22:37.800
IMPORTANT TO POINT THAT OUT.

22:37.866 --> 22:39.533
>> IT'S IMPORTANT BUT I DON'T

22:39.600 --> 22:40.466
THINK THERE'S MUCH SOLACE IN

22:40.533 --> 22:40.666
THAT.

22:40.733 --> 22:41.466
>> Bill: LET'S MOVE ON TO

22:41.533 --> 22:43.900
SOMETHING ELSE.

22:43.966 --> 22:46.300
ANOTHER POINT ABOUT THIS.

22:46.366 --> 22:49.600
>> THIS VERDICT WAS SO OBVIOUS,

22:49.666 --> 22:50.266
WE ALSO WHAT HAPPENED WITH OUR

22:50.333 --> 22:53.033
OWN EYES.

22:53.100 --> 22:53.933
>> Bill: IT DIDN'T USED TO

22:54.000 --> 22:55.900
HAPPEN WHEN IT WAS OBVIOUS, IT

22:55.966 --> 22:56.466
WAS ALWAYS OBVIOUS AND THEY

22:56.533 --> 22:57.633
DIDN'T USED TO DO THIS.

22:57.700 --> 22:58.800
>> THAT FEAR IS THAT WE AREN'T

22:58.866 --> 23:01.633
ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE THE

23:01.700 --> 23:03.800
EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE WITH THE

23:03.866 --> 23:06.333
DEREK CHAUVIN CASE.

23:06.400 --> 23:08.233
>> EVEN WITH THE EVIDENCE, EVEN

23:08.300 --> 23:09.433
WITH THE CAMERAS AND POLICE

23:09.500 --> 23:10.633
VIDEO, THEY'RE STILL GOING TO DO

23:10.700 --> 23:11.200
IT.

23:11.266 --> 23:13.266
LOOK AT WHAT CHAUVIN DID -- IT

23:13.333 --> 23:14.200
DOESN'T MATTER WITH BODY CAMS,

23:14.266 --> 23:16.233
THEY ARE GOING TO DO IT.

23:16.300 --> 23:17.200
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

23:17.266 --> 23:18.633
ACCOUNTABILITY, LET'S GO BACK TO

23:18.700 --> 23:20.266
MY HOMETOWN OF BALTIMORE.

23:20.333 --> 23:21.666
FREDDIE GRAY DIED IN POLICE

23:21.733 --> 23:22.566
CUSTODY, HE SHOULD HAVE NEVER

23:22.633 --> 23:23.600
BEEN IN POLICE CUSTODY.

23:23.666 --> 23:25.566
THE ACCOUNTABILITY.

23:25.633 --> 23:29.166
>> Bill: WHO WAS THE MAYOR?

23:29.233 --> 23:31.066
>> A BLACK WOMAN.

23:31.133 --> 23:34.633
>> Bill: WHO WAS THE D.A.?

23:34.700 --> 23:36.500
I'M JUST SAYING, IT OBVIOUSLY IS

23:36.566 --> 23:40.166
SOMETHING BEYOND RACE THEM.

23:40.233 --> 23:41.700
THAT SUGGESTS THIS MORE ABOUT

23:41.766 --> 23:42.466
POLICING.

23:42.533 --> 23:44.133
EVERYBODY IN THE UPPER ECHELON

23:44.200 --> 23:45.866
IN THE FREDDIE GRAY CASE WAS

23:45.933 --> 23:46.200
BLACK.

23:46.266 --> 23:47.400
YOU CAN'T REPLACE THEM.

23:47.466 --> 23:50.233
>> BUT THE SYSTEM IS THE SAME.

23:50.300 --> 23:51.833
>> Bill: THAT'S THE POINT.

23:51.900 --> 23:55.066
>> THE PROBLEM IS POLICE HAVE

23:55.133 --> 23:56.366
QUALIFIED IMMUNITY, THEY GET THE

23:56.433 --> 23:58.900
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT BEFORE THE

23:58.966 --> 23:59.266
AVERAGE CITIZEN.

23:59.333 --> 24:03.833
>> Bill: NOT SO MUCH ANYMORE.

24:03.900 --> 24:05.233
WHAT ABOUT THIS ONLY 30 MINUTES

24:05.300 --> 24:07.666
AFTER THIS VERDICT CAME IN, A

24:07.733 --> 24:14.600
YOUNG WOMAN MI McKEE O'BRYANT --

24:14.666 --> 24:18.466
THIS IS ONE OF BEEN ONE OF MY

24:18.533 --> 24:19.300
ISSUES, WHY DO THEY ALWAYS HAVE

24:19.366 --> 24:20.300
TO EMPTY THE WHOLE CLIP, MAYBE

24:20.366 --> 24:24.366
THEY HAVE AN ANSWER, ONE SHOT,

24:24.433 --> 24:27.800
COULD THAT POSSIBLY?

24:27.866 --> 24:30.433
HERE'S AN INTERESTING CASE.

24:30.500 --> 24:33.466
SHE WAS STABBING ANOTHER PERSON.

24:33.533 --> 24:34.266
THIS IS A BLACK GIRL WHO WAS

24:34.333 --> 24:40.100
ABOUT TO STAB ANOTHER BLACK GIR

24:40.166 --> 24:40.300
GIRL.

24:40.366 --> 24:43.266
BLACK LIVES MATTER, WHICH ONE?

24:43.333 --> 24:44.433
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING THE

24:44.500 --> 24:47.766
COP DID THE WRONG THING.

24:47.833 --> 24:51.266
>> HE COULD HAVE DEESCALATED IN

24:51.333 --> 24:52.133
A DIFFERENT WAY, HE DIDN'T HAVE

24:52.200 --> 24:53.366
TO USE A BULLET, HE COULD'VE

24:53.433 --> 24:56.833
DONE SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY.

24:56.900 --> 24:58.900
IT SHOULD NOT BE THAT IF THERE

24:58.966 --> 25:01.066
IS A POLICE OFFICER COMING TO

25:01.133 --> 25:04.100
YOUR HOME, SOMEONE DIES.

25:04.166 --> 25:05.433
THERE ARE WAYS, THEY ARE TRAINED

25:05.500 --> 25:06.800
TO DE-ESCALATE AND THERE ARE

25:06.866 --> 25:09.133
SOME PEOPLE WHO DON'T USE THE

25:09.200 --> 25:10.666
TASER.

25:10.733 --> 25:12.633
>> Bill: THAT'S THE PROBLEM,

25:12.700 --> 25:14.033
THEY AREN'T TRAINED TO

25:14.100 --> 25:14.333
DE-ESCALATE.

25:14.400 --> 25:15.400
>> IN BALTIMORE THEY ARE

25:15.466 --> 25:15.766
CHANGING IT TO.

25:15.833 --> 25:18.733
>> I THINK -- NO ONE SHOULD DIE

25:18.800 --> 25:21.866
DURING A TRAFFIC STOP.

25:21.933 --> 25:23.833
NO ONE SHOULD DIE FOR PASSING A

25:23.900 --> 25:25.366
COUNTERFEIT BILL, NO ONE SHOULD

25:25.433 --> 25:29.366
DIE FOR SELLING LOOSE CIGARETTE

25:29.433 --> 25:29.666
CIGARETTES.

25:29.733 --> 25:30.966
A LOT OF THE COPS AND ANALYSTS

25:31.033 --> 25:31.900
THAT I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO

25:31.966 --> 25:34.133
OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS

25:34.200 --> 25:37.233
HAVE SAID WHAT THE COP DID IN

25:37.300 --> 25:38.900
THAT SITUATION, TO SAVE ANOTHER

25:38.966 --> 25:40.133
GIRL FROM BEING STABBED WAS THE

25:40.200 --> 25:42.166
RIGHT THING TO DO.

25:42.233 --> 25:43.233
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE

25:43.300 --> 25:44.500
CASE -- NO ONE WANTS ANY KID TO

25:44.566 --> 25:47.733
DIE AT THE HANDS OF COPS, BUT I

25:47.800 --> 25:48.400
THINK THE PROBLEM IS THEY AREN'T

25:48.466 --> 25:52.433
TRAINED TO DE-ESCALATE.

25:52.500 --> 25:53.133
THE PROBLEM IS SYSTEMIC IN

25:53.200 --> 25:55.533
POLICING AS WELL.

25:55.600 --> 25:57.200
>> Bill: I'VE NEVER BEEN A

25:57.266 --> 25:57.766
COP, I DON'T KNOW WHAT COULD

25:57.833 --> 25:59.666
ACTUALLY BE DONE WHEN SOMEONE'S

25:59.733 --> 26:05.166
GOT THE KNIFE APPEAR.

26:05.233 --> 26:08.366
>> LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

26:08.433 --> 26:09.633
>> Bill: I DON'T KNOW BUT

26:09.700 --> 26:11.466
TASER, I KNOW THAT SHOULD BE

26:11.533 --> 26:12.133
BETTER MARKSMEN, THEY DON'T

26:12.200 --> 26:13.566
SPEND ENOUGH TIME ON THE RANGE,

26:13.633 --> 26:15.066
THAT'S FOR SURE.

26:15.133 --> 26:19.033
I REMEMBER THE KID IN BOSTON --

26:19.100 --> 26:20.000
THE WHOLE BOSTON POLICE

26:20.066 --> 26:21.000
DEPARTMENT FIRED THEIR ENTIRE

26:21.066 --> 26:22.000
CLIPS INTO THE BOAT AND COULDN'T

26:22.066 --> 26:25.300
KILL THE MOTHERFUCKER.

26:25.366 --> 26:26.166
HE WAS HIDING IN THAT BOAT, IT

26:26.233 --> 26:28.600
WAS 10 FEET AWAY.

26:28.666 --> 26:29.933
THEY GOT TO SPEND MORE TIME ON

26:30.000 --> 26:33.066
THE RANGE TO ME AND MAYBE JUST

26:33.133 --> 26:34.133
ONE SHOT WOULD'VE DONE IT.

26:34.200 --> 26:35.400
>> DON'T TELL ME THEY'RE NOT

26:35.466 --> 26:36.600
TRAINED TO THEM FOR THE LEG,

26:36.666 --> 26:38.100
IT'S TOO SMALL A TARGET, THEY

26:38.166 --> 26:39.533
ARE TRAINED TO AIM FOR THE

26:39.600 --> 26:39.733
CHEST.

26:39.800 --> 26:43.100
IF THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM.

26:43.166 --> 26:46.266
>> I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO MY

26:46.333 --> 26:46.500
PREMISE.

26:46.566 --> 26:47.533
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN

26:47.600 --> 26:49.100
POLICING WITH ONE GROUP VERSUS

26:49.166 --> 26:49.633
THE OTHER.

26:49.700 --> 26:50.766
>> Bill: NO ONE'S DENYING

26:50.833 --> 26:50.966
THAT.

26:51.033 --> 26:53.033
>> I NEED TO MAKE THIS POINT AS

26:53.100 --> 26:54.066
A BLACK WOMAN IN AMERICA, I HAVE

26:54.133 --> 26:56.633
TO MAKE THIS POINT.

26:56.700 --> 26:57.633
DID YOU SEE THE VIDEOS THIS WEEK

26:57.700 --> 26:59.933
ON SOCIAL MEDIA WHERE THERE WAS

27:00.000 --> 27:04.033
A YOUNG MAN, A WHITE MAN HAD HIS

27:04.100 --> 27:05.033
GUN OPENED AND TOLD POLICE I'VE

27:05.100 --> 27:05.700
GOT A GUN I'M GOING TO SHOOT YOU

27:05.766 --> 27:08.400
IN THE POLICE OFFICER SAID I SEE

27:08.466 --> 27:09.466
YOUR GUN AND HE GOT AWAY.

27:09.533 --> 27:12.466
>> Bill: YOU COULD ALSO FIND A

27:12.533 --> 27:13.266
ZILLION VIDEOS OF COPS KILLING

27:13.333 --> 27:16.433
WHITE PEOPLE, THEY DO THAT TOO.

27:16.500 --> 27:18.833
>> THERE IS A DISPROPORTIONATE

27:18.900 --> 27:19.066
NUMBER.

27:19.133 --> 27:21.933
IT'S A VERY SENSITIVE AND HARD

27:22.000 --> 27:22.233
ISSUE.

27:22.300 --> 27:23.200
>> Bill: LET'S TALK ABOUT

27:23.266 --> 27:25.300
SOMETHING FUN LIKE CLIMATE

27:25.366 --> 27:28.700
CHANGE.

27:28.766 --> 27:30.200
BECAUSE BIDEN IS MAKING BIG

27:30.266 --> 27:32.300
MOVES, HE SET THE CLIMATE SUMMIT

27:32.366 --> 27:34.266
YESTERDAY THAT WE ARE GOING TO

27:34.333 --> 27:37.166
REDUCE -- THIS IS OUR ATTEMPT,

27:37.233 --> 27:38.500
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY 50%

27:38.566 --> 27:41.333
BY THE END OF THE DECADE, THAT

27:41.400 --> 27:43.466
SEEMS REASONABLE.

27:43.533 --> 27:44.666
DIFFICULT BUT REASONABLE, WE

27:44.733 --> 27:48.000
HAVE TO SET THE BAR HIGH I THIN

27:48.066 --> 27:48.200
THINK.

27:48.266 --> 27:49.833
LINDSEY GRAHAM, THIS IS HIM A

27:49.900 --> 27:51.033
FEW DAYS AGO, I'VE COME TO

27:51.100 --> 27:55.600
CONCLUDE CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL.

27:55.666 --> 27:58.200
IF [LAUGHTER]

27:58.266 --> 27:59.866
WELCOME TO 1990, LINDSAY, PULL

27:59.933 --> 28:03.833
UP A BEANBAG CHAIR.

28:03.900 --> 28:05.333
HE GOES ON TO TALK ABOUT THE

28:05.400 --> 28:06.800
OCEANS AND SAYS COUNT ME IN ON

28:06.866 --> 28:08.600
THE IDEA THAT THE SCIENCE IS

28:08.666 --> 28:12.800
REAL -- OKAY, GREAT.

28:12.866 --> 28:15.133
SO WE HAVE PEOPLE LIKE THAT, I

28:15.200 --> 28:17.366
FEEL LIKE REPUBLICANS STILL

28:17.433 --> 28:19.033
GATHERING.

28:19.100 --> 28:20.033
I KNOW YOU AGREE CLIMATE CHANGE

28:20.100 --> 28:22.100
IS REAL BUT YOU ALSO SAY HOW WE

28:22.166 --> 28:25.900
HANDLE IT IS STILL DEBATABLE.

28:25.966 --> 28:27.300
ISN'T WHAT BIDEN IS DOING NOT

28:27.366 --> 28:27.833
DEBATABLE?

28:27.900 --> 28:29.866
IS THAT WHAT WE SHOULD JUST BE

28:29.933 --> 28:30.066
DOING?

28:30.133 --> 28:32.666
WHAT IS THE DEBATE?

28:32.733 --> 28:33.866
I'M NOT SURE HOW LONG WE CAN

28:33.933 --> 28:34.466
KEEP DEBATING ABOUT WHAT WE

28:34.533 --> 28:40.066
SHOULD BE DOING.

28:40.133 --> 28:41.966
>> I WAS FIRST HERE 11 YEARS AGO

28:42.033 --> 28:43.533
AND I THINK YOU AND I HAVE BEEN

28:43.600 --> 28:45.133
TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE IN

28:45.200 --> 28:46.366
THOSE 11 YEARS, I HAVE EVOLVED A

28:46.433 --> 28:48.700
LOT IN MY POSITION NOT BECAUSE

28:48.766 --> 28:50.533
YOU'VE YELLED AT ME FOR TEN

28:50.600 --> 28:52.633
YEARS.

28:52.700 --> 28:52.966
RIGHT?

28:53.033 --> 28:54.166
BECAUSE CHANGE DOESN'T HAPPEN AT

28:54.233 --> 28:55.566
THE BARREL OF THE GUN, I'VE

28:55.633 --> 28:57.266
EVOLVED IN MY POSITION BECAUSE

28:57.333 --> 29:00.433
THE SCIENCE IS INDISPUTABLE.

29:00.500 --> 29:01.966
I'VE WATCHED THE SCIENCE AND I

29:02.033 --> 29:05.300
HAVE EVOLVED IN WAYS TO SOLVE I

29:05.366 --> 29:07.200
IT.

29:07.266 --> 29:08.166
I THINK THE PROBLEM IS WHEN YOU

29:08.233 --> 29:10.833
TRY TO MAKE CHANGE OF THE BARREL

29:10.900 --> 29:11.700
OF THE GUN TELL PEOPLE THEY ARE

29:11.766 --> 29:13.200
STUPID AND THEY CAN'T HAVE

29:13.266 --> 29:13.900
QUESTIONS, YOU CAN'T HAVE A

29:13.966 --> 29:17.300
DEBATE IN SCIENCE WHICH IS THE

29:17.366 --> 29:18.766
CLOSEST TO ASKING QUESTIONS AND

29:18.833 --> 29:20.966
GETTING TO THE TRUTH, I JUST

29:21.033 --> 29:22.600
DON'T THINK THAT GETS A LOT OF

29:22.666 --> 29:24.766
CONVERTS TO A BECAUSE I KNOW IS

29:24.833 --> 29:25.300
REALLY IMPORTANT TO YOU.

29:25.366 --> 29:26.266
>> Bill: BUT THE SCIENCE IS

29:26.333 --> 29:27.633
SETTLED ON THIS ONE.

29:27.700 --> 29:31.733
I AGREE WITH YOU ABOUT SCIENCE

29:31.800 --> 29:34.233
IN GENERAL.

29:34.300 --> 29:38.400
>> TEXAS HAS TRUMPED SCIENCE.

29:38.466 --> 29:39.133
IF FORGIVE THE PUN.

29:39.200 --> 29:40.966
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

29:41.033 --> 29:42.900
>> WHAT HAPPENED IN DALLAS?

29:42.966 --> 29:45.266
>> Bill: LOSING ELECTRICITY?

29:45.333 --> 29:46.033
>> THE POWER GRID AND THEY HAD

29:46.100 --> 29:49.433
TEMPERATURES BELOW ZERO.

29:49.500 --> 29:50.733
THE POLAR BEARS CAN'T FIND

29:50.800 --> 29:52.333
PLACES TO LIVE ANYMORE AND LET'S

29:52.400 --> 29:53.700
TALK ABOUT KATRINA, TALK ABOUT

29:53.766 --> 29:57.200
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE GULF COAST.

29:57.266 --> 29:58.600
AT SOME POINT IT'S NOT JUST AT

29:58.666 --> 30:01.566
THE BARREL OF A GUN, IF YOU

30:01.633 --> 30:02.366
WATCH SEVERITY OF STORIES.

30:02.433 --> 30:03.466
>> BUT THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD BE,

30:03.533 --> 30:07.300
YOU WATCH THE SCIENCE HAPPEN.

30:07.366 --> 30:07.833
THAT'S HOW PEOPLE LIKE ME

30:07.900 --> 30:10.166
EVOLVED ON THIS ISSUE.

30:10.233 --> 30:11.800
>> IT TAKES TOO LONG TO KEEP

30:11.866 --> 30:16.266
WATCHING AND IT'S TOO LATE.

30:16.333 --> 30:18.233
>> BELIEVE ME, I'VE COVERED A

30:18.300 --> 30:19.066
LOT OF ISSUES YOU WANT CHANGE

30:19.133 --> 30:20.166
FAST AND YOU WANT TO IMMEDIATELY

30:20.233 --> 30:21.366
COME I GET THAT.

30:21.433 --> 30:23.400
I WANT TO CHANGE ON GAY RIGHTS

30:23.466 --> 30:24.033
BEFORE PEOPLE WERE READY FOR IT,

30:24.100 --> 30:27.600
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

30:27.666 --> 30:29.000
LONG TERM MEANINGFUL CHANGE

30:29.066 --> 30:29.900
DOESN'T HAPPEN BY THE RATING

30:29.966 --> 30:31.000
PEOPLE AND TELLING THEM YOU'VE

30:31.066 --> 30:31.633
GOT TO BELIEVE AND IF YOU DON'T

30:31.700 --> 30:34.166
YOU'RE STUPID.

30:34.233 --> 30:36.600
>> Bill: I DON'T REMEMBER

30:36.666 --> 30:37.133
SAYING STUPID BUT YES.

30:37.200 --> 30:41.000
>> I'M SURE YOU HAVE.

30:41.066 --> 30:42.100
>> OKAY NOW.

30:42.166 --> 30:44.800
>> Bill: I WILL CONCEDE THAT

30:44.866 --> 30:45.033
POINT.

30:45.100 --> 30:46.100
BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO DON'T BELIEVE

30:46.166 --> 30:50.700
IN THIS ARE STUPID.

30:50.766 --> 30:50.966
[LAUGHTER]

30:51.033 --> 30:52.833
[APPLAUSE]

30:52.900 --> 30:55.166
HERE IS ONE WHO IS STUPID, THIS

30:55.233 --> 30:56.600
GUY STEVE KUNIN HAS A NEW BOOK

30:56.666 --> 30:59.266
OUT, HE HAD A SERIOUS JOB HE WAS

30:59.333 --> 31:00.833
THE UNDERSECRETARY OF SCIENCE

31:00.900 --> 31:01.566
AND THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY

31:01.633 --> 31:02.600
UNDER OBAMA.

31:02.666 --> 31:04.566
HE'S GOT CREDENTIALS, HE'S A

31:04.633 --> 31:07.066
PROFESSOR, HE'S NOT A MORON.

31:07.133 --> 31:08.200
HE ALSO DID USED TO WORK FOR

31:08.266 --> 31:09.300
BRITISH PETROLEUM, ALWAYS A

31:09.366 --> 31:10.800
RED FLAG FOR ME BECAUSE THE ONLY

31:10.866 --> 31:12.266
PEOPLE WHO DON'T GET ON THE

31:12.333 --> 31:13.466
BOARD WITH THE SCIENCE ON THIS

31:13.533 --> 31:15.100
ARE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR OIL

31:15.166 --> 31:16.100
COMPANIES BUT HE'S GOT A BOOK

31:16.166 --> 31:17.733
OUT THAT I THINK IS JUST GOING

31:17.800 --> 31:20.066
TO BE -- I HOPE NO ONE READS IT,

31:20.133 --> 31:22.866
PLEASE DON'T.

31:22.933 --> 31:24.633
IT'S CALLED "UNSETTLED."

31:24.700 --> 31:26.466
BUT IT'S NOT FUCKING UNSETTLED

31:26.533 --> 31:28.200
AND HERE IS HIS STUPID POINT.

31:28.266 --> 31:30.600
MAYBE IT WON'T BE SO BAD, WE

31:30.666 --> 31:31.000
DON'T KNOW.

31:31.066 --> 31:33.900
YES WE DON'T KNOW, NOTHING IS

31:33.966 --> 31:35.366
FOR SURE, OBVIOUSLY, DUMB POINT!

31:35.433 --> 31:37.366
THERE IS LOTS OF CARBON ALREADY

31:37.433 --> 31:38.366
IN THE ATMOSPHERE, YES, OF

31:38.433 --> 31:41.733
COURSE, THAT'S PART OF THE

31:41.800 --> 31:43.233
PROBLEM, DUMMY.

31:43.300 --> 31:45.100
WE MIGHT INVENT SOMETHING THAT

31:45.166 --> 31:46.300
WOULD SEQUESTER CARBON, YES, WE

31:46.366 --> 31:48.700
MIGHT GET ICE CREAM IN THE MAIL

31:48.766 --> 31:49.466
TOMORROW.

31:49.533 --> 31:51.100
IT WON'T WORK UNLESS ALL THE

31:51.166 --> 31:52.366
COUNTRY'S SIGN ON.

31:52.433 --> 31:54.433
OKAY, LET ME ATTACK THIS ONE.

31:54.500 --> 31:55.966
I'VE BEEN HEARING THIS FOREVER,

31:56.033 --> 31:57.866
YES IT WON'T.

31:57.933 --> 31:59.833
THE WAY TO DO THAT APPARENTLY S

31:59.900 --> 32:01.933
NOT JUST TO WAIT UNTIL EVERYBODY

32:02.000 --> 32:02.533
SIGNS -- THE WAY TO DO IT IS

32:02.600 --> 32:05.333
JUST TO DO IT THERE TO START

32:05.400 --> 32:07.233
DOING THINGS, TO LEAD.

32:07.300 --> 32:12.800
[APPLAUSE]

32:12.866 --> 32:15.000
FRANCE BANNED ALL TWO OUR

32:15.066 --> 32:16.666
FLIGHTS WITHIN THE COUNTRY,

32:16.733 --> 32:17.933
TURTLE HOURS AND LESS.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.066
IN OTHER WORDS, TAKE THE TRAIN,

32:21.133 --> 32:22.133
OKAY?

32:22.200 --> 32:22.733
LET'S START SOMEWHERE.

32:22.800 --> 32:24.966
IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO FLY IF IT'S

32:25.033 --> 32:26.633
LESS THAN TWO HOURS, STUFF LIKE

32:26.700 --> 32:26.833
THAT.

32:26.900 --> 32:29.666
AMSTERDAM HAS DONE IT, YOU JUST

32:29.733 --> 32:32.366
HAVE TO DO IT AND MAKE EVERYBODY

32:32.433 --> 32:34.000
ELSE LOOK LIKE THE PARIAH AND

32:34.066 --> 32:34.266
THEY WILL.

32:34.333 --> 32:37.000
>> WHAT YOU DO WITH CHINA?

32:37.066 --> 32:39.666
THEY LOVE THEMSELVES SOME COAL.

32:39.733 --> 32:42.500
>> Bill: SO DO WE.

32:42.566 --> 32:44.600
>> WE ARE CUTTING BACK.

32:44.666 --> 32:48.466
WE ARE LOOKING FOR CLEANER WAYS.

32:48.533 --> 32:50.366
>> THIS IS AN ARGUMENT I WOULD

32:50.433 --> 32:52.200
HAVE MADE, THIS IS AN ARGUMENT A

32:52.266 --> 32:53.700
LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE

32:53.766 --> 32:55.533
OF THIS ISSUE HAVE MADE AND

32:55.600 --> 32:56.466
WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE?

32:56.533 --> 32:58.433
I GUESS WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING

32:58.500 --> 32:58.633
THEN.

32:58.700 --> 33:00.400
I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE ANSWER.

33:00.466 --> 33:06.266
>> CHINA DOES BUY A LOT OF OUR

33:06.333 --> 33:08.000
COAL, MAYBE WE SAY NO MORE.

33:08.066 --> 33:10.133
>> Bill: I DIDN'T KNOW WE

33:10.200 --> 33:12.600
COULD DO THAT.

33:12.666 --> 33:15.033
JUST A BUTTON THIS UP, EARTH

33:15.100 --> 33:15.366
OVERSHOOT DAY?

33:15.433 --> 33:17.400
I NEVER HEARD OF THIS BUT I DID

33:17.466 --> 33:17.733
THIS YEAR.

33:17.800 --> 33:19.433
THIS IS THE DAY WHEN HUMANITY

33:19.500 --> 33:21.566
HAS USED ALL THE BIOLOGICAL

33:21.633 --> 33:22.500
RESOURCES THE EARTH CAN RENEW

33:22.566 --> 33:24.733
DURING THAT YEAR.

33:24.800 --> 33:27.900
WE HIT HOURS AND 2020 ON AUGUST

33:27.966 --> 33:29.800
AUGUST 22ND, WE ARE CURRENTLY

33:29.866 --> 33:31.900
USING 60% MORE THAN WHAT THE

33:31.966 --> 33:32.300
PLANET CAN RENEW.

33:32.366 --> 33:38.566
NOW FOR SOME COMEDY.

33:38.633 --> 33:41.600
IT WAS FOR 20, DID YOU CELEBRATE

33:41.666 --> 33:42.233
FOR 20?

33:42.300 --> 33:45.400
>> AT WHAT TIME?

33:45.466 --> 33:45.666
[LAUGHTER]

33:45.733 --> 33:46.600
>> Bill: THE HOLIDAY.

33:46.666 --> 33:48.600
>> WHAT SPECIFIC TIME OF DAY,

33:48.666 --> 33:52.500
YOU GAVE ME THE DAY, WAS IT

33:52.566 --> 33:52.700
8:05?

33:52.766 --> 33:54.600

34:14.233 --> 34:14.566
POT, IT REALLY IS.

34:14.633 --> 34:18.766
IT'S ABOUT GETTING FUCKED UP ON

34:18.833 --> 34:19.333
ALL KINDS OF DRUGS.

34:19.400 --> 34:24.733
IT'S TRUE.

34:24.800 --> 34:27.233
MUSHROOMS ARE HAVING A MOMENT,

34:27.300 --> 34:30.533
THEY REALLY ARE.

34:30.600 --> 34:31.866
MUSHROOMS, THEY ARE LEGALIZED IN

34:31.933 --> 34:34.966
OREGON, THAT'S PRETTY GREAT.

34:41.033 --> 34:42.133
THE PHARMACEUTICAL

34:42.200 --> 34:42.700
ANTIDEPRESSANT BULLSHIT, THE

MUSHROOMS DO BETTER.

34:46.266 --> 34:48.400
[APPLAUSE]

34:48.466 --> 34:50.533
THEY ARE ALREADY STARTING TO

34:50.600 --> 34:51.433

35:09.700 --> 35:12.366
REALITY?

35:12.433 --> 35:20.400
MAYBE IT'S TIME TO TRY TRIPITOR.

35:20.466 --> 35:22.166
THESE MUSHROOMS WHEN TAKEN ON AN

35:22.233 --> 35:24.133
EMPTY STOMACH IN A DARK ROOM,

35:24.200 --> 35:25.533
TRIPITOR GOES RIGHT TO WORK ON

35:25.600 --> 35:26.300
UPTIGHT THE PART OF THE BRAIN

35:26.366 --> 35:28.433
THAT MAKES YOU WHERE CLOSE AND

35:28.800 --> 35:30.200
MUSHROOMS GO INTO THE SOURCE OF

35:30.266 --> 35:30.800
HER DEPRESSION BY HELPING YOU

35:30.866 --> 35:33.866
REALIZE THAT WE ARE ALL THE SAME

35:33.933 --> 35:34.633
ORGANISM, MAN.

35:34.700 --> 35:37.100
WHEN THE FIRE HYDRANT TURNS INTO

35:37.166 --> 35:38.633
A FROG, THAT MEANS IT'S WORKING.

35:38.700 --> 35:39.833
DON'T ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF

35:39.900 --> 35:42.033
MUSHROOMS ARE RIGHT FOR YOU,

35:42.100 --> 35:43.433
JUST TRY THEM.

35:43.500 --> 35:44.066
SIDE EFFECTS MAY INCLUDE

35:44.133 --> 35:44.966
BECOMING A WIZARD AND A BLACK

35:45.033 --> 35:46.033
LIGHT POSTER, PETTING A DOG THE

THAT WE HAD SIX MONTHS AGO WHICH

38:10.833 --> 38:11.933
IS THAT PEOPLE OF THE

38:12.000 --> 38:12.633
UNITED STATES HATE EACH OTHER

38:12.700 --> 38:14.533
AND WILL NOT WORK WITH EACH

38:14.600 --> 38:15.400
OTHER.

FIRST OF ALL, 78% OF REPUBLICANS

38:32.700 --> 38:34.400
>> OF COURSE IT'S RIDICULOUS.

38:34.466 --> 38:35.366
45% THINK THE ATTACKS OF THE

38:35.433 --> 38:37.700
CAPITAL WENT TOO FAR BUT HAD A

38:37.766 --> 38:38.433
POINT.

38:38.500 --> 38:39.733
51% SAID THE PARTY'S LEADERS DID

38:39.800 --> 38:44.300

WON THE ELECTION.

38:47.433 --> 38:49.466
BACK IN DECEMBER THERE WAS A

38:49.533 --> 38:50.066
SURVEY, THE BIGGEST THREAT TO

38:50.133 --> 38:52.933

THIS IS SERIOUS.

42:35.766 --> 42:37.233
>> I HAVEN'T MET ANY WHO ARE

42:37.300 --> 42:40.366
ASHAMED OF IT.

42:40.433 --> 42:41.033
OR EMBARRASSED BY IT.

42:41.100 --> 42:42.366
>> Bill: I'M ALWAYS TRYING TO

42:42.433 --> 42:44.533
FOCUS ON THE FUTURE HERE, NOT

42:44.600 --> 42:45.200
JUST THE PAST.

42:45.266 --> 42:46.833
>> WHAT'S GOOD TO HAPPEN NEXT?

42:46.900 --> 42:49.466
THE FIRE IN THE BELLY IS STILL

42:49.533 --> 42:49.700
THERE.

42:49.766 --> 42:53.800
>> Bill: LET ME JUST TELL YOU.

42:53.866 --> 42:54.800
>> WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME THE

42:54.866 --> 42:58.166
MOVIE YOU WANT TO SEE?

42:58.233 --> 43:00.233
>> Bill: IT WAS 2020 LAST

43:00.300 --> 43:03.833
YEAR, WE HAD A CENSUS, THEY ARE

43:03.900 --> 43:05.033
COUNTING, THAT MEANS

43:05.100 --> 43:05.366
REDISTRICTING.

43:05.433 --> 43:06.566
REPUBLICANS WILL DRIVE THE

43:06.633 --> 43:08.166
REDISTRICTING PROCESS IN 20

43:08.233 --> 43:09.700
STATES, DEMOCRATS IN JUST 11

43:09.766 --> 43:11.566
BECAUSE THEY GOT THE

43:11.633 --> 43:12.300
LEGISLATURES, THEY HAVE FEDERAL

43:12.366 --> 43:12.766
JUDGES.

43:12.833 --> 43:14.500
THIS IS THE KIND OF STUFF THAT

43:14.566 --> 43:15.766
GOES ON BEHIND THE SCENES OF

43:15.833 --> 43:17.366
PEOPLE DON'T NOTICE THAT'S GOING

43:17.433 --> 43:18.833
ON RIGHT NOW THAT'S ACTUALLY

43:18.900 --> 43:20.866
CHANGING YOUR LIFE IN THE

43:20.933 --> 43:21.100
FUTURE.

43:21.166 --> 43:24.633
THEY COULD GET THE HOUSE JUST IN

43:24.700 --> 43:29.000
NEWLY CREATED DISTRICTS.

43:29.066 --> 43:30.000
NEW YORK, ILLINOIS, AND

43:30.066 --> 43:31.633
CALIFORNIA ARE EXPECTED TO LOSE

43:31.700 --> 43:32.400
CONGRESSIONAL SEATS, THAT'S JUST

43:32.466 --> 43:35.266
POPULATION MOVING OUT -- I KNOW

43:35.333 --> 43:37.933
WHY THEY LEAVE HERE.

43:38.000 --> 43:38.400
[LAUGHTER]

43:38.466 --> 43:40.233
TEXAS IS EXPECTED TO GAIN THREE

43:40.300 --> 43:43.500
AND FLORIDA IS EXPECTED TO GAIN

43:43.566 --> 43:47.000
TWO, SO THAT'S THE REALITY.

43:47.066 --> 43:49.200
PUT THAT IN COMBINATION OF THIS

43:49.266 --> 43:51.166
IDEA OF HOW MUCH THEY JUST DID

43:51.233 --> 43:52.066
NOT ACCEPT THE LOSS.

43:52.133 --> 43:54.533
DOES ANYBODY EVER SAY TO THESE

43:54.600 --> 43:56.866
PEOPLE YOU'RE JUST FUCKING SORE

43:56.933 --> 43:57.766
LOSERS?

43:57.833 --> 43:59.566
[APPLAUSE]

43:59.633 --> 44:00.833
ELECTIONS, IT'S ALWAYS PRETTY

44:00.900 --> 44:03.100
MUCH A 50-50 PROPOSITION, YOU

44:03.166 --> 44:05.433
WIN SOME, YOU'LL LOSE SOME BUT

44:05.500 --> 44:06.633
NO, YOU'D RATHER HYPNOTIZE

44:06.700 --> 44:08.033
YOURSELF INTO BELIEVING HE WON

44:08.100 --> 44:11.766
THIS ONE TO THE POINT WHERE YOU

44:11.833 --> 44:13.900
MENTIONED PROTESTS, THEY HAVE

44:13.966 --> 44:14.566
THESE WE ARE GOING TO RUN YOU

44:14.633 --> 44:17.300
OVER LAWS.

44:17.366 --> 44:19.933
WHERE IS IT, IOWA?

44:20.000 --> 44:21.600
AND OKLAHOMA AND FLORIDA ALREADY

44:21.666 --> 44:24.500
HAD IT, OF COURSE, FLORIDA.

44:24.566 --> 44:25.966
>> THEY HAVE IMMUNITY.

44:26.033 --> 44:28.400
>> OF PEOPLE ARE PROTESTING IN

44:28.466 --> 44:29.766
THE STREET, IMMUNITY FOR RUNNING

44:29.833 --> 44:32.500
YOUR CAR -- YOU WOULD RATHER RUN

44:32.566 --> 44:33.233
PEOPLE OVER THEN ADMIT YOU LOST

44:33.300 --> 44:35.133
AN ELECTION.

44:35.200 --> 44:36.000
>> TELL THAT TO HEATHER HIGHER

44:36.066 --> 44:38.666
WHO DIED IN CHARLOTTESVILLE --

44:38.733 --> 44:40.733
HE WOULD'VE HAD A GREAT CASE.

44:40.800 --> 44:46.200
HE USED THAT CAR AS HIS DEAF DEF

44:46.266 --> 44:46.433
MOBILE.

44:46.500 --> 44:48.166
HE NOT ONLY KILLED HER BUT HE

44:48.233 --> 44:48.633
INJURED OTHER PEOPLE.

44:48.700 --> 44:51.366
YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE HER

44:51.433 --> 44:52.666
IMMUNITY?

44:52.733 --> 44:54.366
I HATE TO SAY THIS BUT

44:54.433 --> 44:55.800
REPUBLICANS LOVE TO USE THE

44:55.866 --> 44:58.300
QUOTES OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING

44:58.366 --> 44:59.233
JR.

44:59.300 --> 45:00.666
BUT BEFORE HE DIED, BEFORE HE

45:00.733 --> 45:02.566
BECAME A MARTYR, HE WAS A

45:02.633 --> 45:03.800
MARCHER.

45:03.866 --> 45:05.466
THEY DON'T REMEMBER THAT.

45:05.533 --> 45:06.066
HE MARCHED LIKE HEATHER HEIER

45:06.133 --> 45:10.566
AND ALL OF THESE OTHER PEOPLE,

45:10.633 --> 45:13.233
AND THEY WANT TO USE CARS TO

45:13.300 --> 45:15.366
INTIMIDATE.

45:15.433 --> 45:18.600
>> NOT ONLY THAT, REPUBLICANS OF

45:18.666 --> 45:20.966
81 NEW ANTI-PROTEST LAWS AROUND

45:21.033 --> 45:23.200
THE COUNTRY AGAINST STUFF THAT'S

45:23.266 --> 45:24.800
ALREADY ILLEGAL, LOOTING IS

45:24.866 --> 45:25.600
ALREADY ILLEGAL, STUFF THAT'S

45:25.666 --> 45:26.766
ALREADY ON THE BOOKS THEY WANT

45:26.833 --> 45:28.533
TO MAKE SUPER EXTRA ILLEGAL OR

45:28.600 --> 45:31.533
MORE PUNISHABLE.

45:31.600 --> 45:32.366
MISDEMEANORS BECOME FELONIES BUT

45:32.433 --> 45:34.600
THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN

45:34.666 --> 45:35.133
YOU'RE OUT OF IDEAS.

45:35.200 --> 45:37.666
IF THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE

45:37.733 --> 45:39.566
WHEN YOU'D RATHER

45:39.633 --> 45:40.200
--------------------------------

45:40.266 --> 45:40.833
--------------------------------

45:40.900 --> 45:41.433
--------------- TO DEMOCRACY

45:41.500 --> 45:42.066
COME UP WITH THEIR OWN IDEAS.

45:42.133 --> 45:45.000
THEY ARE DONE WITH THEIR IDEAS.

45:45.066 --> 45:45.733
>> Bill: THAT'S YOUR PARTY, IS

45:45.800 --> 45:47.966
IT NOT?

45:48.033 --> 45:49.066
SO WHAT IS YOUR SOLUTION TO YOUR

45:49.133 --> 45:52.333
PARTY BEING OUT OF IDEAS?

45:52.400 --> 45:54.066
>> I'M VOTING WITH MY WALLET,

45:54.133 --> 45:55.366
AND VOTING WITH MY MOUTH,

45:55.433 --> 45:57.333
BLOATED WITH MY FEET, I VOTED

45:57.400 --> 45:57.866
FOR JOE BIDEN AND I'M NOT

45:57.933 --> 45:59.966
SUPPORTING THIS PARTY.

46:00.033 --> 46:01.000
I'M CALLING OUT THIS PARTY IN

46:01.066 --> 46:04.766
ANY WAY, NO ONE'S LISTENING.

46:04.833 --> 46:06.166
>> Bill: GEORGE W. BUSH I SAW

46:06.233 --> 46:06.966
WAS IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK HE'S

46:07.033 --> 46:07.700
GOT A BOOK HE'S SELLING AND HE

46:07.766 --> 46:11.366
SAID HE WROTE IN THE CONDOLEEZZA

46:11.433 --> 46:14.000
RICE WHICH IS SUCH A COWARDLY

46:14.066 --> 46:14.900
THING, JUST DON'T VOTE, OKAY, I

46:14.966 --> 46:17.400
GET IT.

46:17.466 --> 46:19.133
IT WAS ONLY TWO CHOICES, IT'S

46:19.200 --> 46:20.500
AMERICA, YOU GET TWO CHOICES,

46:20.566 --> 46:21.933
ONE IS BETTER THAN THE OTHER.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.966
>> IT WASN'T EVEN HARD THIS YEA

46:25.033 --> 46:28.300
YEAR.

46:28.366 --> 46:28.900
>> Bill: HE'S GOT AN APPROVAL

46:28.966 --> 46:30.900
RATING NOW -- WOW, 33% WHEN HE

46:30.966 --> 46:34.966
LEFT AND 61%, AMONG DEMOCRATS.

46:35.033 --> 46:38.566
IF HE WENT UP FROM 11% TO 54%

46:38.633 --> 46:40.433
APPROVAL, WHAT'S GOING ON THERE?

46:40.500 --> 46:44.366
IS THAT JUST BECAUSE TRUMP, WE

46:44.433 --> 46:48.033
SAW WITH THE WORST COULD BE?

46:48.100 --> 46:55.066
>> JUXTAPOSED TRUMP TO W -- THEY

46:55.133 --> 46:56.400
SEE HIM COMING TOGETHER WITH THE

46:56.466 --> 46:57.066
OTHER LIVING PRESIDENTS WHO

46:57.133 --> 46:59.766
HAPPEN TO BE DEMOCRATIC AND HE'S

46:59.833 --> 47:00.766
WORKING WITH THEM.

47:00.833 --> 47:02.600
I'M GOING TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,

47:02.666 --> 47:03.800
THIS MIGHT SEEM TRITE BUT THE

47:03.866 --> 47:05.866
WAY HE FALLS INTO THE ARMS OF

47:05.933 --> 47:07.966
MICHELLE OBAMA, THAT SHOWS YOU A

47:08.033 --> 47:12.300
HUMANITY THING.

47:12.366 --> 47:14.500
>> I DON'T THINK ANYONE HAS

47:14.566 --> 47:15.766
INCREASED AFFECTION FOR HIS

47:15.833 --> 47:17.033
POLICIES, A LOT OF THEM WERE

47:17.100 --> 47:17.366
WORSE TODAY.

47:17.433 --> 47:19.200
BUT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

47:19.266 --> 47:20.566
RENEWED AFFECTION FOR HIM

47:20.633 --> 47:20.866
PERSONALLY.

47:20.933 --> 47:23.100
I THINK THAT IS TRUMP'S LASTING

47:23.166 --> 47:23.333
LEGACY.

47:23.400 --> 47:25.333
>> Bill: HE WASN'T TRYING TO

47:25.400 --> 47:26.200
ENRICH HIMSELF LIKE TRUMP WAS

47:26.266 --> 47:27.166
COME I THINK HE TRULY BELIEVED,

47:27.233 --> 47:30.100
HE WAS JUST RAISED IN THAT

47:30.166 --> 47:31.500
MIND-SET.

47:31.566 --> 47:34.233
>> HE STARTED PAINTING FOR HIS

47:34.300 --> 47:34.433
MIND.

47:34.500 --> 47:35.733
>> Bill: I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE

47:35.800 --> 47:37.600
UP ON THE IDEA THAT HE WAS A

47:37.666 --> 47:38.366
SHIT PRESIDENT.

47:38.433 --> 47:39.433
BUT I WAS TOO HARD ON HIM.

47:39.500 --> 47:42.966
I REALIZE THAT.

47:43.033 --> 47:44.800
>> IN A RECESSION, WHEN HE LEFT

47:44.866 --> 47:45.700
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

47:45.766 --> 47:48.100
WE HAD MORE, WE HAD FINANCIAL --

47:48.166 --> 47:51.000
WE HAD DEATH TOLLS.

47:51.066 --> 47:52.766
>> Bill: HE WAS AT SHITTY

47:52.833 --> 47:53.033
PRESIDENT.

47:53.100 --> 47:54.033
I WAS STILL A LITTLE TOO HARD ON

47:54.100 --> 47:54.200
HIM.

47:54.266 --> 47:57.533
>> I HEAR FROM DEMOCRATS ALL THE

47:57.600 --> 47:59.066
TIME, WE DID ROMNEY DIRTY, THAT

47:59.133 --> 48:01.700
WAS A GOOD MAN WE CALL THE

48:01.766 --> 48:04.533
MONSTER.

48:04.600 --> 48:07.166
>> ROMNEY FLIP-FLOPS A LOT.

48:07.233 --> 48:09.166
>> NEXT TO TRUMP, I'LL TAKE IT.

48:09.233 --> 48:11.166
>> Bill: THANK YOU, I'VE GOT

48:11.233 --> 48:20.933
TO GO TO NEW RULES.

48:21.000 --> 48:21.400
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

48:21.466 --> 48:22.033
NEW RULE: SOMEONE NEEDS TO TELL

48:22.100 --> 48:22.833
WOMEN'S MAGAZINE EDITORS TO STOP

48:22.900 --> 48:23.866
INVENTING LISTS OF SEXY PLACES

48:23.933 --> 48:24.966
TO TOUCH YOUR BOYFRIEND.

48:25.033 --> 48:32.033
TRUST ME.

48:32.100 --> 48:35.800
IT'S NOT A LIST,

48:35.866 --> 48:36.066
[LAUGHTER]

48:36.133 --> 48:36.566
AND IT'S BEEN

48:36.633 --> 48:36.833
[APPLAUSE]

48:36.900 --> 48:38.466
POPULAR FOR ABOUT 300,000 YEARS.

48:38.533 --> 48:40.000
NEW RULE: THE INVENTOR OF

48:40.066 --> 48:41.200
SHITTENS - THE TOILET PAPER

48:41.266 --> 48:42.500
SHAPED LIKE A MITTEN - HAS TO

48:42.566 --> 48:45.033
TELL US WHAT HAPPENED THAT GAVE

48:45.100 --> 48:47.333
HIM THE IDEA.

48:47.400 --> 48:47.600
[LAUGHTER]

48:47.666 --> 48:48.733
I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS.

48:48.800 --> 48:50.166
SO YES, I DO WANT TO MEET YOU.

48:50.233 --> 48:51.433
BUT NO, I DON'T WANT TO SHAKE

48:51.500 --> 48:54.800
YOUR HAND.

48:54.866 --> 48:55.066
[LAUGHTER]

48:55.133 --> 48:59.066
[APPLAUSE]

48:59.133 --> 49:00.000
NEW RULE: FROM THIS DAY FORWARD,

49:00.066 --> 49:00.566
THIS LOOK WILL BE KNOWN AS

49:00.633 --> 49:08.733
"ARRESTING BITCH FACE."

49:08.800 --> 49:09.000
[LAUGHTER]

49:09.066 --> 49:10.233
[APPLAUSE]

49:10.300 --> 49:11.000
NEW RULE: NOW THAT ARCH

49:11.066 --> 49:11.800
CONSERVATIVES JIM CAVIEZEL AND

49:11.866 --> 49:13.600
LIN WOOD ARE SOUNDING THE ALARM

49:13.666 --> 49:15.166
ABOUT ADRENOCHROME, WHICH IS THE

49:15.233 --> 49:16.666
BELIEF THAT LIBERALS LITERALLY

49:16.733 --> 49:17.833
DRINK THE BLOOD OF TERRIFIED

49:17.900 --> 49:19.733
CHILDREN FOR A PSYCHOACTIVE

49:19.800 --> 49:21.566
EFFECT, I HAVE ONE THING TO SAY

49:21.633 --> 49:22.300
TO YOU: DON'T KNOCK IT TILL YOU

49:22.366 --> 49:29.033
TRY IT.

49:29.100 --> 49:29.300
[LAUGHTER]

49:29.366 --> 49:31.200
[APPLAUSE]

49:31.266 --> 49:31.800
IT'S REALLY GOOD, MAN.

49:31.866 --> 49:32.733
THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS, SOMETIMES

49:32.800 --> 49:33.533
AFTER YOU DRINK THE KID'S BLOOD

49:33.600 --> 49:35.066
IT TAKES FOREVER TO KICK IN.

49:35.133 --> 49:36.166
SO YOU GET IMPATIENT AND DRINK

49:36.233 --> 49:38.033
MORE CHILDREN'S BLOOD, AND THEN

49:38.100 --> 49:43.133
- UH-OH!

49:43.200 --> 49:46.233
THIS IS GONNA BE A NIGHT!

49:46.300 --> 49:46.500
[LAUGHTER]

49:46.566 --> 49:48.033
[APPLAUSE]

49:48.100 --> 49:48.600
NEW RULE: MATT GAETZ'S

49:48.666 --> 49:49.533
SPOKESMAN, HARLAN HILL, HAS TO

49:49.600 --> 49:55.500
PROVE HE'S NOT UNDERAGE.

49:55.566 --> 49:56.766
[LAUGHTER]

49:56.833 --> 49:57.700
WHO IS THIS GUY, HE LOOKS LIKE

49:57.766 --> 49:58.333
THE ACCOUNTANT FOR THE LOLLIPOP

49:58.400 --> 50:03.066
GUILD.

50:03.133 --> 50:03.333
[LAUGHTER]

50:03.400 --> 50:04.700
BUT AS MATT GAETZ'S SPOKESMAN,

50:04.766 --> 50:05.266
HARLAN HAS TWO QUESTIONS:

50:05.333 --> 50:06.033
"DOESN'T IT BEHOOVE US TO

50:06.100 --> 50:07.033
RE-INSTATE DUE PROCESS TO ITS

50:07.100 --> 50:08.666
RIGHTFUL CONSTITUTIONAL

50:08.733 --> 50:09.300
STANDING" - AND, "DO YOU GUYS

50:09.366 --> 50:16.166
WANT TO RIDE BIKES?"

50:16.233 --> 50:16.600
[LAUGHTER]

50:16.666 --> 50:17.666
[APPLAUSE]

50:17.733 --> 50:19.066
AND FINALLY, NEW RULE.

50:19.133 --> 50:21.900
THREE MONTHS INTO HIS

50:21.966 --> 50:23.300
PRESIDENCY, IT'S TIME TO ADMIT

50:23.366 --> 50:23.933
THAT JOE BIDEN HAS BEEN A HUGE

50:24.000 --> 50:24.433
DISAPPOINTMENT.

50:24.500 --> 50:33.566
TO COMEDIANS.

50:33.633 --> 50:34.433
[LAUGHTER]

50:34.500 --> 50:35.366
[APPLAUSE]
