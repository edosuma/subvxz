WEBVTT

00:13.875 --> 00:15.833
<i>Here she is!</i>
<i>Here she is, coming out!</i>

00:15.916 --> 00:17.416
<i>We can see her right now.</i>

00:17.500 --> 00:20.833
<i>Let's hear what</i>
<i>our new deputy police chief has to say.</i>

00:20.916 --> 00:23.416
<i>- Ms. Scalia, please go ahead.</i>
- Agata!

00:24.333 --> 00:27.333
<i>- There isn't much we can say.</i>
- Ah. So you're friends with the cops?

00:27.416 --> 00:29.458
<i>I can only say that,</i>
<i>to the public,</i>

00:29.541 --> 00:31.458
<i>Gambino appeared</i>
<i>to be a respectable accountant.</i>

00:32.291 --> 00:33.625
<i>He was working with the Mafia.</i>

00:33.708 --> 00:35.666
That's the lady
who came all the way from Milan

00:35.750 --> 00:37.833
just so she could wage war on the Mafia.

00:38.333 --> 00:39.333
That's enough.

00:39.416 --> 00:41.458
Let's get it over with, huh?
That's enough.

00:42.916 --> 00:47.250
<i>However, Gambino had recently chosen</i>
<i>to cooperate with the law.</i>

00:48.958 --> 00:50.541
<i>It was thanks to his statement</i>

00:50.625 --> 00:54.625
<i>that we've been able to make </i>
<i>countless arrests over the past few days.</i>

00:54.708 --> 00:57.583
<i>He would've been placed</i>
<i>in witness protection soon,</i>

00:57.666 --> 01:00.625
<i>but unfortunately, someone decided</i>
<i>to silence him first.</i>

01:01.125 --> 01:03.750
<i>We're examining all movement</i>
<i>at the murder scene.</i>

01:03.833 --> 01:08.250
<i>and we're hoping that we will be able</i>
<i>to bring the perpetrators to justice soon.</i>

01:08.333 --> 01:10.958
<i>Thank you so much</i>
<i>for giving us your time.</i>

01:11.041 --> 01:14.791
<i>So for the time being,</i>
<i>that's all we have to report on.</i>

01:15.291 --> 01:17.666
<i>And now, back to you at the station.</i>

01:18.166 --> 01:19.916
The Holy Father has spoken.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.541
He said you'd better
tell us why you killed Gambino.

01:24.791 --> 01:26.000
Why did you kill him?

01:26.083 --> 01:26.916
Hmm?

01:27.791 --> 01:30.208
- I'll tell you! It's true. We did it!
- Huh?

01:52.875 --> 01:56.958
We killed him because Gambino
was sleeping with his wife, Ester.

01:57.041 --> 02:00.375
She's also my sister.
We had to do it to avenge our honor.

02:00.458 --> 02:03.333
How could we have known
that he was one of your guys?

02:03.416 --> 02:04.333
Yeah. Yes.

02:04.416 --> 02:06.083
Are we're supposed to believe you?

02:06.583 --> 02:08.666
You're talkin' a lot of nonsense.

02:08.750 --> 02:10.708
No! No! I swear to you.

02:10.791 --> 02:12.750
There's proof. Look here in my tool belt.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.708
Take it. There's your proof. Take it!

02:15.958 --> 02:17.208
Press play!

02:17.291 --> 02:19.833
I wanted to use it
against Ester in case we got a divorce.

02:19.916 --> 02:21.250
<i>Hi, Alberto.</i>

02:21.333 --> 02:22.833
<i>It's Ester.</i>

02:22.916 --> 02:26.791
<i>I know I was the one who canceled,</i>
<i>but I've changed my mind.</i>

02:26.875 --> 02:29.333
<i>I just found out</i>
<i>my husband is going to Castelmonte</i>

02:29.416 --> 02:31.458
<i>and won't be back until tonight.</i>

02:31.541 --> 02:34.833
<i>So, wait for me,</i>
<i>because I will be with you soon.</i>

02:34.916 --> 02:36.875
<i>See you soon, my tortellone.</i>

02:36.958 --> 02:38.125
Tortellone!

02:59.291 --> 03:01.125
The Holy Father says

03:01.208 --> 03:06.250
that the cuckold and the cuckold's friend,
without meaning to, have done us a favor.

03:07.166 --> 03:10.375
So, guys,
let's show these men some respect.

03:12.333 --> 03:13.541
- Bravo!
- Well done.

03:17.791 --> 03:18.791
Well done!

03:19.416 --> 03:20.500
Well done.

03:27.583 --> 03:29.875
So, are you both still frightened?

03:29.958 --> 03:32.833
Do you want a glass of water?

03:37.375 --> 03:39.375
<i>Buon appetito,</i> gentlemen.

03:40.333 --> 03:43.916
To our guests and this amazing sauce
the Holy Father has made us.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.291
Cheers!

03:55.541 --> 03:56.500
What?

03:56.583 --> 03:57.833
Why don't you eat?

03:58.791 --> 04:00.333
I just don't like carbohydrates.

04:00.416 --> 04:02.708
What the fuck is wrong with you. Eat it!

04:04.833 --> 04:05.916
So tell me this.

04:06.666 --> 04:08.416
Have you ever tasted a sauce so good?

04:08.500 --> 04:10.083
- Yum.
- Mm, it's excellent.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.333
- Mm.
- Eh.

04:11.916 --> 04:15.375
I do prefer my mom's sauce
because there's less onions, you know?

04:19.666 --> 04:22.166
How dare you say
your mother's sauce is better.

04:22.250 --> 04:24.083
Calm down, Useless Thing.

04:28.750 --> 04:31.291
You're very lucky
that we're all such nice people here.

04:31.375 --> 04:32.791
Yes, you can tell.

04:35.958 --> 04:37.500
Here. Taste this.

04:37.583 --> 04:38.500
I'll take it.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.250
- Mm.
- Do you like it?

04:42.333 --> 04:43.458
Exceptional.

04:43.541 --> 04:45.458
It's primo sale. My passion.

04:45.541 --> 04:47.708
- Nice, nice, nice.
- Yeah?

04:47.791 --> 04:50.083
Well done, you behave like a man.

04:50.166 --> 04:53.166
Well, anyone in my place
would kill his wife's lover, right?

04:53.250 --> 04:55.083
Well, we got a new problem.

04:55.166 --> 04:58.375
Your wife might know a few things
we don't want her to.

04:58.458 --> 05:00.208
That's not good for us.

05:00.833 --> 05:05.250
So the Holy Father has ordered that
your wife go and be with her tortellone.

05:05.333 --> 05:07.583
- Tortellone.

05:10.375 --> 05:11.791
You don't put a hand on my wife.

05:15.541 --> 05:16.833
I'll take her out.

05:17.541 --> 05:18.875
It would be an honor.

05:20.583 --> 05:22.875
You're giving me faith in the human race.

05:25.666 --> 05:28.125
Where have our traditional values gone?

05:30.166 --> 05:31.250
I'll tell ya.

05:31.791 --> 05:32.791
Locked away!

05:33.416 --> 05:35.500
With all our friends who got arrested.

05:36.083 --> 05:37.291
I know.

05:37.375 --> 05:40.791
If they got arrested,
then we did something wrong.

05:40.875 --> 05:42.583
But we're still the Mafia.

05:43.083 --> 05:45.291
We're hidden, but we're still here.

05:45.791 --> 05:48.750
Right up until the government
lowers their defenses.

05:48.833 --> 05:49.833
- Ka-kah!
- Oh God!

05:51.583 --> 05:53.083
We'll cut their head off.

05:54.083 --> 05:56.750
Way back when, to be part of <i>Cosa Nostra,</i>

05:56.833 --> 05:58.041
you needed courage.

05:58.625 --> 05:59.833
Now you need patience.

05:59.916 --> 06:01.791
Yeah, patience.

06:04.750 --> 06:06.083
To the old days.

06:08.875 --> 06:09.875
Cheers to that.

06:13.458 --> 06:14.583
Hey, here's some for you.

06:14.666 --> 06:17.083
No, I'm allergic to dairy products.

06:17.166 --> 06:19.166
Oh, well. More for me.

06:19.958 --> 06:20.833
Listen.

06:20.916 --> 06:22.458
The Holy Father wants to know

06:22.541 --> 06:25.583
what that piece of shit Gambino
managed to tell the police.

06:26.791 --> 06:28.750
And seeing as how
you're in love with the chief…

06:28.833 --> 06:31.166
Well, no, I think
you're a little confused

06:31.250 --> 06:32.791
because I'm not in love with her.

06:32.875 --> 06:34.791
- You're into her.
- I'm not into her.

06:34.875 --> 06:36.250
You're into her!

06:36.333 --> 06:37.291
I'm not into her.

06:37.375 --> 06:38.291
You're into her!

06:38.375 --> 06:39.833
I'm into her.

06:39.916 --> 06:42.375
Huh. I could see it in your eyes.

06:42.458 --> 06:44.875
It's just that I'd prefer
not to do that to her.

06:50.541 --> 06:52.291
Oh, what's the problem?

06:52.375 --> 06:54.333
- There is no problem.
- Exactly.

06:54.416 --> 06:55.708
We'll have someone else do it.

06:55.791 --> 06:57.875
That's right. Anyone else could do it.

06:57.958 --> 07:00.250
I could do it,
but I'd probably do it wrong.

07:00.333 --> 07:01.166
Yeah.

07:01.250 --> 07:03.791
Whereas you guys are experts.
Wouldn't you agree?

07:03.875 --> 07:06.083
- Or he'd make a mistake.
- You know?

07:06.166 --> 07:08.458
We'll get someone else. Yeah, don't worry.

07:08.958 --> 07:11.583
Actually, let's make a toast
to this hero's mom,

07:11.666 --> 07:13.791
who apparently makes a special sauce.

07:14.291 --> 07:15.666
What is your mother's name?

07:15.750 --> 07:17.083
Antonietta.

07:17.166 --> 07:18.583
To Mrs. Antonietta.

07:18.666 --> 07:22.458
May you bless this lady
with another 100 years of good health!

07:22.541 --> 07:24.625
To my mother!

07:37.500 --> 07:38.875
Listen. Thinking about it,

07:39.458 --> 07:42.916
that thing about the cop,
the one I'm into, we can do it.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.166
I hope you're not saying it because
you think that I would get offended.

07:47.250 --> 07:49.708
Mr. Primo Sale, are you kidding me?

07:49.791 --> 07:51.416
Now that we're on such good terms,

07:51.500 --> 07:53.833
if you think something like that,
I'm the one who's offended.

07:53.916 --> 07:56.166
Okay, yeah. Bravo. I'm glad.

07:57.000 --> 07:57.958
Bon appétit.

08:00.916 --> 08:03.000
Holy Father has a question.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.708
What day next week
can we all get together?

08:05.625 --> 08:08.208
The best days
for him are Tuesday and Friday.

08:08.291 --> 08:11.916
Well, as far as I am concerned,
tell him I'm always available.

08:12.666 --> 08:13.666
What about you, Scientist?

08:13.750 --> 08:16.500
I can't on Friday.
I'm installing Internet in an apartment.

08:17.500 --> 08:18.625
What about you, Geppetto?

08:18.708 --> 08:22.208
I got to install two solid wooden doors
on Tuesday, so no.

08:22.291 --> 08:23.333
Stockfish?

08:23.416 --> 08:26.791
I just don't know why we have to keep
getting together on the days

08:26.875 --> 08:28.708
we do the most business at my shop.

08:29.208 --> 08:30.125
And you, Class Act?

08:30.208 --> 08:34.000
No, I've gotta study for my law exams.
I don't pass, I don't graduate.

08:34.083 --> 08:37.125
Nah, nah, let the boy keep studying.

08:37.208 --> 08:40.250
I can do Friday.
However, I have to leave at five.

08:40.333 --> 08:44.000
There's an anti-Mafia candlelight vigil
at the town hall I need to be at.

08:45.375 --> 08:48.166
But this is no good. Work with me here.

08:49.666 --> 08:50.875
Shall we meet on Zoom?

08:50.958 --> 08:53.125
I haven't got Zoom. Let's do Skype.

08:53.208 --> 08:55.625
No, no, no, no, let's download Houseparty.

08:55.708 --> 08:57.583
Let's do WhatsApp. Everyone's got that.

08:57.666 --> 09:00.416
- What's what?
- Come on.

09:21.125 --> 09:23.958
If you touch my sister, I'll report you.
I don't care about the Mafia.

09:24.041 --> 09:25.875
I'm not actually gonna kill her,
you idiot.

09:25.958 --> 09:28.250
- You said you'd kill her.
- I had to say that to save her.

09:28.333 --> 09:30.416
- Otherwise, they'd kill her.
- How is that saving her?

09:30.500 --> 09:32.208
I don't know.
What do you think I should say?

09:32.291 --> 09:33.916
I want you to say you're sorry

09:34.000 --> 09:36.041
because it's your fault
we're here in the first place.

09:36.125 --> 09:39.083
But not your sister's fault for
wanting to go out and screw the wrong guy.

09:39.166 --> 09:41.000
The thriller expert. The thrillologist.

09:41.083 --> 09:43.666
And now I have to figure out some way
that the woman who betrayed me

09:43.750 --> 09:45.208
doesn't get herself murdered.

09:46.291 --> 09:48.875
Anyway, we'll figure out
what to do about her later.

09:48.958 --> 09:51.541
You go find out
what Agata knows about Gambino.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.250
And how should I do that, though?

09:53.333 --> 09:56.125
How should I know?
Come on! Ask her out to dinner.

10:11.416 --> 10:12.791
Valentino?

10:14.458 --> 10:18.416
But please, make sure there's no cheese
because I'm allergic to dairy products.

10:18.500 --> 10:20.666
Of course. Don't worry.

10:20.750 --> 10:21.958
And for your wine?

10:22.041 --> 10:23.500
It's the lady's choice.

10:24.125 --> 10:25.500
Are you allergic to wine too?

10:25.583 --> 10:26.791
Not to wine, no.

10:29.875 --> 10:30.875
Hmm.

10:31.541 --> 10:33.583
Ah, I see you have Limnio.

10:34.166 --> 10:36.041
This is one I haven't drunk in ages.

10:36.625 --> 10:38.708
- I'd like that, please.
- Wonderful choice.

10:39.666 --> 10:42.333
You know, I read
that Aristotle spoke about this wine.

10:42.916 --> 10:45.708
I get it. You did that whole thing
so you could talk about the time

10:45.791 --> 10:48.625
that our school friends
decided to lock us up in the cupboard.

10:48.708 --> 10:49.708
- No!
- Huh?

10:49.791 --> 10:50.625
No.

10:50.708 --> 10:53.750
- In Greece.
- That's not what I'm saying. No.

10:53.833 --> 10:56.291
Maybe involuntary association,
but involuntary.

10:56.375 --> 10:59.916
- Involuntary?
- Involuntary, Vale. I swear.

11:00.750 --> 11:03.083
The whole class laughed all day.

11:03.166 --> 11:05.583
Not the whole class. I wasn't laughing.

11:05.666 --> 11:09.791
Actually, I never totally understood
why they decided to play that prank

11:09.875 --> 11:11.125
on the two of us.

11:13.208 --> 11:14.375
Mysterious.

11:15.750 --> 11:18.541
I remember you had
one of your claustrophobic attacks.

11:18.625 --> 11:21.291
- That's right. I used to get those.

11:22.166 --> 11:25.416
And I remember you were so scared
I said to close your eyes

11:25.500 --> 11:28.416
and imagine being in a beautiful field

11:28.500 --> 11:31.375
on a beautiful sunny day.

11:31.458 --> 11:35.125
That's when I took your hand,
and then I start to sing.

11:47.375 --> 11:48.708
- Do you remember?
- Of course I do!

11:48.791 --> 11:50.333
- That's where I learned it.

11:50.916 --> 11:52.916
- Uh, yeah.
- Oh my goodness.

12:07.208 --> 12:08.791
Will you be the one tasting?

12:08.875 --> 12:10.250
Yes, thank you.

12:20.416 --> 12:21.375
Hmm.

12:22.333 --> 12:24.666
I think it may need
to air out a little first.

12:24.750 --> 12:26.625
Did you lock it up in the cupboard?

12:28.291 --> 12:31.041
No, don't mind us. We're just joking.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.708
We were talking
about how when we were in high school

12:33.791 --> 12:35.958
our friends locked us up
in the cupboard to scare us,

12:36.041 --> 12:39.291
but it's in the past now. Right?

12:40.625 --> 12:42.458
Are you still scared?

12:43.041 --> 12:44.666
Can I get you a glass of water?

12:45.291 --> 12:47.041
Yes, please.

12:58.583 --> 12:59.416
Ah.

13:00.250 --> 13:03.458
You might wanna take advantage
of Black Friday to update your cell phone.

13:03.541 --> 13:06.083
No, I'm just really attached
to this old phone.

13:06.166 --> 13:08.791
- <i>Oh, I see.</i>
- <i>I can barely put it down.</i>

13:09.708 --> 13:10.708
Stockfish!

13:10.791 --> 13:12.458
Are you going to be much longer?

13:12.541 --> 13:14.791
My customers prefer that they're shelled.

13:15.291 --> 13:18.166
Do you want one?
These are prawns from Pietrammare.

13:18.250 --> 13:19.541
No, just hurry up.

13:19.625 --> 13:21.875
<i>Nothing gets past you, does it?</i>

13:21.958 --> 13:23.833
<i>You can tell you're a police officer.</i>

13:23.916 --> 13:27.625
Speaking of which, I wanted to ask you
something about that case.

13:27.708 --> 13:31.000
The one where, you know,
that accountant was killed.

13:31.083 --> 13:34.125
- Hmm.
- That Gambino or Gambini.

13:34.208 --> 13:35.083
Gambino.

13:35.166 --> 13:36.541
- Ah, Gambino.
- Yes.

13:36.625 --> 13:38.375
Was he really part of the Mafia?

13:40.208 --> 13:41.166
Yes.

13:41.875 --> 13:43.583
But they'd been wiretapping him
for a while.

13:43.666 --> 13:45.416
It's just that I was still in Milan.

13:46.291 --> 13:50.041
Then as soon as I got into town
and read the wiretap transcriptions,

13:50.125 --> 13:51.708
I decided to put some pressure on him.

13:51.791 --> 13:52.750
Oh.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.333
And to my surprise,
he started saying names.

13:57.333 --> 13:59.791
<i>But he was nervous, scared.</i>

14:00.291 --> 14:04.000
<i>So I reminded him that,</i>
<i>if he decided to talk to us,</i>

14:04.083 --> 14:05.750
<i>we had the means to protect him.</i>

14:05.833 --> 14:06.708
<i>Of course.</i>

14:06.791 --> 14:09.416
- If he didn't, then we couldn't help out.
- Yeah.

14:10.875 --> 14:13.083
He said that he needed to consider things.

14:13.166 --> 14:15.625
And while he was considering,
they killed him.

14:16.125 --> 14:17.166
Unfortunately.

14:17.250 --> 14:21.083
In the meantime, though,
he must've said something important.

14:21.166 --> 14:22.583
That's why he was killed.

14:24.083 --> 14:25.458
Are you a sleuth now?

14:26.125 --> 14:29.208
No, I just really
like those TV detective shows.

14:29.291 --> 14:32.250
- Ah. Okay.
- A guilty pleasure.

14:32.333 --> 14:34.791
- That's the only reason.
- Ha ha. Those series.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.666
You have all become detectives, huh?

14:37.750 --> 14:38.750
- Oh boy.

14:41.666 --> 14:42.958
Sorry, I have to take this.

14:44.208 --> 14:45.291
Lo Russo?

14:47.875 --> 14:48.916
Tell me everything.

14:53.958 --> 14:57.333
HOME APPLIANCES

15:31.458 --> 15:32.625
Uh, excuse me.

15:32.708 --> 15:33.541
The bathroom?

15:33.625 --> 15:35.625
- It's right over there.
- Thank you.

15:38.583 --> 15:40.958
And what do you want me to say to that?

15:41.750 --> 15:45.583
If they cleaned everything, then we're
obviously dealing with professionals.

15:49.791 --> 15:52.291
Well, the only noteworthy thing
we've found

15:52.375 --> 15:55.583
was a laptop that the victim
had hidden behind a fake wall.

15:56.208 --> 15:57.708
Yes, a laptop.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.916
It's obviously password protected. Yes.

16:04.625 --> 16:07.833
The public prosecutor ordered it
to be filed as evidence.

16:09.500 --> 16:12.833
Yes, but I think we'll find something
as soon as we can crack it.

16:13.916 --> 16:15.833
Goodbye, Lo Russo. Have a good night.

16:25.541 --> 16:27.708
What were you thinking
of using this gun for?

16:27.791 --> 16:30.000
What are you doing?
Oh, don't do that. It's loaded!

16:30.083 --> 16:32.291
- Be careful!
- Thought you'd walk in and kill me?

16:32.375 --> 16:35.166
What did you and Valentino do?
And I don't want a lie!

16:35.250 --> 16:36.666
I always tell the truth to you.

16:36.750 --> 16:37.625
You liar!

16:37.708 --> 16:41.791
Oh, I'm a liar? You have a lover,
and you're telling me that <i>I'm </i>the liar?

16:41.875 --> 16:43.791
- Come on!
- You thought it was okay to shoot him?

16:43.875 --> 16:45.083
I didn't shoot your tortellone!

16:45.166 --> 16:46.750
So what are you doing outside his house?

16:46.833 --> 16:49.833
No, no, I was in Castelmonte all day.

16:49.916 --> 16:53.083
You went to Castelmonte
after you killed him, you liar!

16:53.166 --> 16:55.875
What are you doing? Hey!
Hey, what are you doing?

16:58.916 --> 17:00.291
Go on and kill me!

17:02.291 --> 17:04.208
Then for once in your life
you'll notice me!

17:04.833 --> 17:05.916
No.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.375
Oh.

17:07.458 --> 17:10.250
The usual story
of the wife who feels neglected,

17:10.333 --> 17:12.625
so she goes out
and gets herself a Mafioso!

17:12.708 --> 17:14.666
How would I know that he's a Mafioso?

17:14.750 --> 17:16.958
How could you not know that
about your lover?

17:17.041 --> 17:19.333
Unlike you, he made me feel important.

17:19.416 --> 17:20.250
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

17:20.333 --> 17:22.291
Where'd you find the guy?
Over at the Mafia store?

17:22.375 --> 17:25.041
He was at yoga,
which you never once took with me.

17:25.125 --> 17:28.875
No possibility that you'll ever get me
to your hippie yoga classes.

17:29.666 --> 17:31.666
Tell me, what's so good about this guy?

17:32.583 --> 17:34.541
He's handsome, for starters.

17:38.500 --> 17:41.375
Well, this is
the second time I've seen you.

17:41.875 --> 17:45.625
And look. You're more beautiful now
with your new haircut.

17:46.375 --> 17:48.166
I'm glad you noticed.

17:48.875 --> 17:50.791
My lady, how could you not notice

17:50.875 --> 17:54.208
the sun as it rises in the morning?

17:55.000 --> 17:56.583
Namaste.

17:59.541 --> 18:00.458
Gambino.

18:02.416 --> 18:04.458
Alberto Gambino.

18:04.541 --> 18:05.916
<i>Oh, was he handsome?</i>

18:06.000 --> 18:08.583
Handsome fella! Handsome! Well!

18:08.666 --> 18:10.208
- Yes.
- Okay.

18:10.291 --> 18:11.541
Did you love him, though?

18:11.625 --> 18:13.250
I want to know if you loved him.

18:14.541 --> 18:15.541
Did you love him?

18:15.625 --> 18:18.375
The one thing that I did love
is that I felt important.

18:19.291 --> 18:22.333
And you? Were you in love
with the supermarket cashier?

18:22.916 --> 18:24.875
But of course
you'd bring that up right now.

18:24.958 --> 18:26.375
Ancient history. Let it go.

18:26.458 --> 18:28.708
This will be ancient history
in a while too.

18:31.875 --> 18:34.791
You wanna shoot me, do it.
Let's get this thing over with.

18:38.708 --> 18:39.833
I'm back.

18:40.750 --> 18:41.916
So sorry about that.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.333
Oh, no worries.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.041
Anyways, where did we leave things?

18:47.125 --> 18:49.041
Uh, we were talking about work.

18:49.125 --> 18:52.250
- Your work.
- Ah, yes. Let's move on, all right?

18:52.333 --> 18:54.250
Yeah, let's change the subject.

18:54.333 --> 18:56.041
Enough with the work! Please!

18:58.125 --> 19:00.041
- Ah, finally arrived.
- Here you go.

19:01.041 --> 19:03.333
- I was joking.
- It's all right.

19:03.416 --> 19:04.500
- No cheese, right?
- No.

19:04.583 --> 19:07.458
- So my mom didn't make this?

19:07.541 --> 19:10.958
About that, I see you've got
a wonderful relationship with your mom.

19:11.041 --> 19:11.958
Eh.

19:12.666 --> 19:14.500
If only I had the same with my son.

19:16.375 --> 19:17.208
Son?

19:17.750 --> 19:19.291
I thought you said you weren't married.

19:19.375 --> 19:20.291
So what?

19:20.375 --> 19:22.041
That means I can't have a son?

19:23.000 --> 19:25.291
Oh. Well, I guess anything's possible.

19:27.250 --> 19:30.625
For now,
he's staying with that father of his.

19:30.708 --> 19:33.250
- There's a father too?
- I didn't create him in a lab.

19:33.333 --> 19:35.625
But anyway, I don't want
to talk about his father.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.625
He was only good at lying to me.

19:38.625 --> 19:39.875
He never was, uh…

19:39.958 --> 19:42.000
It was just impossible for him
to be honest.

19:42.083 --> 19:43.291
And he always…

19:44.958 --> 19:46.208
was lying, you know?

19:47.666 --> 19:49.500
He was a pathological liar.

19:49.583 --> 19:51.333
And I was a fool for trusting him.

19:55.875 --> 19:58.291
Moving on. That's enough talk
about unpleasant things.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.041
To the fantastic class G

20:02.666 --> 20:04.791
and to being locked in a cupboard.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.250
To getting locked in a cupboard.

21:27.666 --> 21:29.041
Come on. It's late.

21:29.125 --> 21:31.958
I've still gotta go and install
those doors tomorrow.

21:32.041 --> 21:33.791
And I don't want to reschedule it.

21:45.041 --> 21:45.958
Oh, you're here.

21:46.041 --> 21:48.500
- What's going on in here?
- Come on. Come in.

21:50.041 --> 21:52.125
What have you done to my sister?

21:54.958 --> 21:56.666
- Is he still down there?
- Who?

21:56.750 --> 21:58.958
- Useless Thing.
- Why do you always have to insult me?

21:59.041 --> 22:00.833
No, not you. Well, actually, yes, you.

22:00.916 --> 22:02.916
But I'm talking
about the Useless Thing downstairs.

22:03.000 --> 22:03.916
You did it again!

22:04.000 --> 22:05.416
D'oh.

22:05.500 --> 22:06.916
Are you two finished?

22:07.000 --> 22:08.541
We need the body out of here now.

22:08.625 --> 22:09.791
Whose body is it?

22:09.875 --> 22:10.958
It's mine.

22:11.041 --> 22:14.916
- You stop the talking.
- Oh, I see. You're staging a murder.

22:15.250 --> 22:17.916
I nearly fainted.
Salvo, next time, warn me.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.833
Next time, I'll send you a text.

22:19.916 --> 22:21.708
- Useless Thing.
- He's down there.

22:21.791 --> 22:23.708
That time it was for you!

22:23.791 --> 22:24.833
Let's go.

22:53.333 --> 22:54.625
Well done.

22:55.166 --> 22:56.041
All done.

22:57.083 --> 23:00.166
Good work, gentlemen.
That's two you've done now.

23:01.041 --> 23:02.833
You're making a career here.

23:04.083 --> 23:04.916
Open it.

23:05.583 --> 23:06.416
But…

23:07.000 --> 23:07.833
Open it.

23:12.791 --> 23:15.750
Shame. She was beautiful.

23:17.333 --> 23:20.666
- Have you checked to see if she's dead?
- It's pretty clear she's passed on.

23:20.750 --> 23:23.541
No, you need to check the jugular.

23:24.250 --> 23:26.875
We can't risk burying
people who are still alive.

23:27.375 --> 23:29.250
We're Mafia, but we're not cruel.

23:32.041 --> 23:33.500
All right, I'll do it.

23:33.583 --> 23:34.916
Uh, Mr. Useless Thing…

23:35.000 --> 23:36.375
Mr. Tonino.

23:36.458 --> 23:40.916
I wanted to tell you something.
Something about my lady cop friend.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.250
I heard some other information.

23:42.833 --> 23:45.500
I just didn't have
my phone on me at that moment,

23:45.583 --> 23:47.833
and you couldn't hear what she was saying.

23:48.458 --> 23:49.500
And what did she say?

23:51.125 --> 23:55.041
Uh, she basically said they
found a computer, a laptop,

23:55.125 --> 23:56.375
at Gambino's apartment,

23:56.458 --> 23:59.250
and he, apparently,
was hiding proof on the computer.

24:00.750 --> 24:02.958
And where is this computer at now?

24:03.708 --> 24:05.250
It was filed as evidence.

24:05.916 --> 24:06.833
Good.

24:06.916 --> 24:08.500
Well done. That's great work.

24:09.541 --> 24:11.333
- This is yours now. I--
- No.

24:12.958 --> 24:14.750
Never take this phone off of you.

24:14.833 --> 24:18.250
And every time you see that cop lady,
you give us a call, okay?

24:18.333 --> 24:21.000
- My agreement was--
- There is no agreement.

24:22.250 --> 24:25.125
We need to find out every word
that Gambino said to her.

24:25.208 --> 24:26.041
Is that clear?

24:29.541 --> 24:30.916
Make her disappear.

24:31.500 --> 24:33.500
Yes, we'll cut her up into little pieces.

24:34.500 --> 24:36.500
And then we'll feed her to the pigs.

24:37.333 --> 24:39.041
In different farms, of course.

24:41.916 --> 24:43.000
Yes.

25:05.500 --> 25:06.375
Thank you.

25:07.916 --> 25:10.541
Thank you? You can just thank
this brother of yours.

25:10.625 --> 25:11.583
This is just great.

25:11.666 --> 25:13.125
And she keeps on talking.

25:13.208 --> 25:15.166
She cheated on me
and she's got a lot to say.

25:15.250 --> 25:16.791
I'd say we're even now, wouldn't you?

25:16.875 --> 25:19.458
What's that got to do with anything?
That cashier seduced him.

25:19.541 --> 25:22.666
- Oh, so you knew about it?
- Of course I knew about it.

25:22.750 --> 25:24.833
So why are you lecturing me
when you knew that?

25:24.916 --> 25:27.833
It's just that you're a woman,
and he's a man. It's normal.

25:27.916 --> 25:30.625
- Okay, so he's allowed to cheat?
- Of course.

25:33.666 --> 25:36.125
Listen, I'd love it
if you'd stop trying to help.

25:36.208 --> 25:38.458
Go! Let's get out of here
and hide her somewhere.

25:38.541 --> 25:40.291
You're a Neanderthal.

26:34.958 --> 26:37.666
Guys, the pastry shop is closed at night.

26:37.750 --> 26:39.625
No, uh, we're looking for shelter.

26:39.708 --> 26:41.625
We can't give shelter to tourists.

26:41.708 --> 26:45.041
When pilgrims come, we can give shelter.
Is that what you are?

26:45.125 --> 26:46.000
Yes, we are.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.625
This is our first stop
before we go and find the Holy Land.

26:49.708 --> 26:50.583
Really?

26:50.666 --> 26:52.500
- Yeah.
- Great!

26:52.583 --> 26:57.458
You'll be pleased then, because you're
just in time for evening prayers.

26:57.541 --> 26:59.166
Welcome, brothers and sisters.

27:48.916 --> 27:50.041
Amen!

27:59.625 --> 28:02.458
- Twenty-five euros a night?
- It's reasonable.

28:02.541 --> 28:04.166
All right, let's say three nights.

28:05.166 --> 28:07.166
- You gonna give me a receipt?
- Huh?

28:09.291 --> 28:12.041
Are you sure I shouldn't call Mom
and tell her I'm okay?

28:12.125 --> 28:13.541
Better not for the time being.

28:13.625 --> 28:14.458
And remember,

28:14.541 --> 28:17.916
do not use your phone
for any reason at all. It's important.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.375
How long do I have
to stay here with these monks?

28:20.458 --> 28:23.458
We don't know yet,
but we'll keep you updated.

28:23.541 --> 28:26.916
Would you watch out for yourself?
These people are very dangerous.

28:27.000 --> 28:27.875
Yeah.

28:29.958 --> 28:32.875
Breakfast is a separate payment.

28:32.958 --> 28:33.833
Huh?

28:35.333 --> 28:37.583
The Lord will provide.

28:37.666 --> 28:38.666
Ah.

28:38.750 --> 28:41.083
- Come with me, miss.
- Thank you.

28:43.333 --> 28:44.708
Bye.

29:03.083 --> 29:05.625
<i>You have reached the voicemail service.</i>

29:05.708 --> 29:07.541
<i>- Hello, you have…</i>
- Where's the breakfast?

29:07.625 --> 29:09.791
This is becoming a habit for you, Mom.

29:09.875 --> 29:11.500
I might as well go and live on my own.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.666
It's no use. The phone is off.

29:13.750 --> 29:16.166
- Whose phone?
- Your sister's phone.

29:16.250 --> 29:18.750
It's been turned off since last night.

29:18.833 --> 29:20.083
Maybe it's broken.

29:20.166 --> 29:23.541
Why do you always have to be so anxious
if you can't get a hold of her right then?

29:23.625 --> 29:26.708
- I'll get it. Don't move. I'll go.

29:30.750 --> 29:31.708
Agata.

29:31.791 --> 29:33.041
Valentino?

29:33.625 --> 29:36.125
- I didn't think I'd run into you.
- Yeah…

29:36.208 --> 29:38.208
I came to visit my mother.

29:38.291 --> 29:39.791
- Oh.
- Yeah. And you?

29:39.875 --> 29:42.625
Oh, Ester asked me
to bring her these photos,

29:42.708 --> 29:44.250
but she didn't pick up her phone, so…

29:44.333 --> 29:46.083
My daughter has gone missing!

29:46.166 --> 29:47.041
What do you mean?

29:47.125 --> 29:49.916
She's not at work.
Her phone's been switched off.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.541
- And now her husband killed her!
- Yeah, what are you talking about, Mom?

29:53.625 --> 29:56.125
No, a mother can feel things
when they're going wrong.

29:56.208 --> 29:58.250
Why don't you just go upstairs
and make a cake

29:58.333 --> 30:01.083
and fill it with lots of ricotta.
Let's go. Go on. Into the kitchen.

30:01.166 --> 30:03.583
Madam, don't worry.
I'll look into it for you, okay?

30:03.666 --> 30:04.916
Thank you.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.041
One daughter!
That's all God ever gave to me.

30:08.125 --> 30:10.000
God gave you a son too.

30:11.208 --> 30:14.083
Agata, I'm mortified.

30:15.666 --> 30:17.750
Look, I'm sorry about my mom.

30:17.833 --> 30:19.291
She's got senile dementia.

30:19.375 --> 30:21.625
And it's getting worse the older she gets.

30:21.708 --> 30:24.375
She was never really
in a good state, honestly.

30:25.041 --> 30:26.583
You'd never know she has dementia.

30:26.666 --> 30:29.458
You wouldn't think so,
but she does live in her own reality.

30:29.541 --> 30:31.291
She sees things that aren't there.

30:31.833 --> 30:34.750
So shouldn't you go back
and move in with her again?

30:34.833 --> 30:37.291
She hasn't even noticed
that he's gone yet.

30:37.375 --> 30:39.500
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Really.

30:39.583 --> 30:42.416
Anyway, you were saying
something before about missing evidence.

30:42.916 --> 30:46.041
Yes, it was a computer we found
hidden in the walls

30:46.125 --> 30:48.166
when we were searching through Gambino's.

30:48.250 --> 30:51.000
- Just last night?
- They knew what they were looking for.

30:51.083 --> 30:53.875
I am so angry about it.
This should never have happened.

30:55.333 --> 30:57.916
The only explanation is
that they have spies all over.

30:58.750 --> 31:00.750
Yeah, that's it. That's gotta be it.

31:00.833 --> 31:02.208
Bastards.

31:10.958 --> 31:12.166
Let me get out.

31:12.958 --> 31:14.416
There you go.

31:14.500 --> 31:15.541
Thank you.

31:18.333 --> 31:21.500
Guys, thank you for the lift.
You didn't have to.

31:21.583 --> 31:24.333
No, we didn't,
but we couldn't let you take a taxi.

31:24.416 --> 31:28.458
I mean, just thinking that there was
a killer in our building makes me nervous.

31:28.541 --> 31:32.625
Anyway, if I remember anything at all,
Officer, I'll let you know.

31:32.708 --> 31:34.541
Hey again, mister.

31:39.166 --> 31:40.625
Do you know this man?

31:40.708 --> 31:41.875
Yeah, I do.

31:41.958 --> 31:45.958
We saw him the other day,
on the stairs in our building.

31:46.041 --> 31:49.083
He was playing cops and robbers
out in the hallway that day.

31:49.166 --> 31:52.041
Shut up.
Would you like it if your game was ruined?

31:52.125 --> 31:55.541
- Surely it's finished by now.
- What if it's not, though?

31:56.666 --> 32:00.208
Can't you see there's cops right there?
They can still catch him.

32:00.291 --> 32:02.750
This man came
to your building the other day to play?

32:02.833 --> 32:06.416
I'm sorry, but we told him
that we wouldn't talk to anyone.

32:07.541 --> 32:10.166
You can talk now,
because the game is finished.

32:11.208 --> 32:12.916
It's finished, right?

32:14.500 --> 32:17.166
- The other day, when?
- The day of the strike.

32:17.250 --> 32:19.041
Shut up!

32:19.125 --> 32:20.333
Sir, I told you.

32:20.416 --> 32:24.583
There was a strike at school on Monday,
and the children stayed at home.

32:29.375 --> 32:32.708
I believe that we all
need to have a very long talk.

32:40.333 --> 32:43.416
See? Now the cops are playing too.
