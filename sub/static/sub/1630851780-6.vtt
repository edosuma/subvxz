WEBVTT

00:22.622 --> 00:24.791
It's been half an hour,
and all I can see is water, Tai.

00:25.625 --> 00:26.760
Are you sure?

00:27.260 --> 00:30.730
Yes, Raul. The location
is not a hundred percent exact.

00:31.231 --> 00:33.199
Go straight, he's ahead of you.

00:34.501 --> 00:35.435
Okay.

00:43.109 --> 00:44.444
Isn't it there? There.

00:59.893 --> 01:00.927
Tomás?

01:01.227 --> 01:03.596
-God!
-Calm. Breathe.

01:03.663 --> 01:05.065
-Calm.
-We are here.

01:05.131 --> 01:06.833
-Have some water.
-Tell us what happened.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.537
Kelvin and I rented a boat,
you know?

01:11.071 --> 01:12.906
We came here to have fun,
listen to music and drink.

01:12.972 --> 01:15.642
I woke up, and Kelvin was gone.
He's missing!

01:15.708 --> 01:17.944
I searched everywhere,
but I couldn't find him.

01:18.011 --> 01:19.412
We're stuck in here!

01:19.479 --> 01:21.381
Calm! Tell me.

01:21.448 --> 01:23.349
What is your relationship
with Kelvin?

01:23.850 --> 01:25.518
We're friends.
We came here to have fun!

01:26.986 --> 01:28.388
This can't be happening.

01:28.455 --> 01:29.756
Hey, look at me.

01:30.523 --> 01:33.326
We just need
to retrace your steps.

01:33.660 --> 01:34.761
You don't understand.

01:34.828 --> 01:35.895
On Tuesday morning,

01:35.962 --> 01:38.231
Kelvin and I have to go back
to jail.

01:38.298 --> 01:39.999
Otherwise,
things will get worse!

01:40.533 --> 01:41.734
Much worse, damn it!

02:20.039 --> 02:21.374
EPISODE:
KELVIN

02:25.912 --> 02:26.880
Here you are.

02:28.114 --> 02:31.651
Have you seen a boat here?
Has anyone made an announcement?

02:32.252 --> 02:33.219
Okay. Thank you.

02:37.357 --> 02:39.125
Rest assure we will pay you.

02:39.926 --> 02:41.060
Grilo is reliable.

02:41.661 --> 02:42.729
Don't worry.

02:42.795 --> 02:44.397
Let's focus
on Kelvin's disappearance.

02:44.464 --> 02:46.966
If Grilo wasn't reliable,
we wouldn't be here.

02:47.033 --> 02:48.101
Waldir guaranteed us.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.969
I realized I was in trouble
and called Grilo.

02:50.470 --> 02:54.140
I'm going to need you
to help me find your friend.

02:54.207 --> 02:55.275
That's all I want.

02:55.341 --> 02:56.609
Tell me, have you called him?

02:56.943 --> 02:59.179
Yes, several times, but it seems
he doesn't have reception.

02:59.946 --> 03:01.581
Does he have family here?

03:02.749 --> 03:03.750
His family mustn't know.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.253
I will have to tell his family,
whether you like it or not.

03:08.221 --> 03:09.589
There was a girl with us.

03:10.657 --> 03:12.725
So, we're not looking
for just one person,

03:13.526 --> 03:15.061
but two, right?

03:16.563 --> 03:18.831
At the end of the pier,
there's a black car.

03:18.898 --> 03:19.866
Wait for us there.

03:21.100 --> 03:23.636
You will tell us everything
on our way back to "Ausentes".

03:23.703 --> 03:24.971
-Go and rest.
-Go.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.612
Why do I have a feeling

03:32.679 --> 03:34.847
that this case will make me
get migraines?

03:57.770 --> 03:59.639
Come in. That way.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.084
Did you take him out
out of quicksand?

04:12.085 --> 04:15.922
Next time, let me know,
and I'll get a coat, a towel.

04:15.989 --> 04:18.458
If you knew where I found him,
you wouldn't believe me.

04:19.292 --> 04:21.661
I got you an appointment
with my family's doctor.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.196
-What?
-An appointment.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.698
I don't have time, Edith,
and you know it.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.333
And I have no patience with you.

04:27.667 --> 04:30.036
I don't want to find you
passed out ever again.

04:32.972 --> 04:35.775
Do you know where I found
your insulin prescription?

04:35.842 --> 04:38.111
Under your desk, lost.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.014
I bought it, okay?

04:41.914 --> 04:43.416
Don't forget to take it.

04:44.450 --> 04:45.451
I love you, Edith.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.621
I'm getting tired of you!

04:48.688 --> 04:49.789
They are for the kid.

04:51.591 --> 04:53.726
Kelvin de Souza,
25 years old, colored man.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.728
Resident in Jardim Alfredo.

04:55.795 --> 04:58.731
He's been missing
for around 10 hours.

04:58.798 --> 05:01.501
He was last seen
yesterday past midnight

05:01.567 --> 05:04.704
having a good time
with his friend Tomás and a girl

05:04.771 --> 05:07.273
at an island
in Guarapiranga dam.

05:07.340 --> 05:10.643
The problem is they're prisoners
in semi-open regime.

05:10.710 --> 05:12.812
They were granted
a temporary release

05:12.879 --> 05:15.348
due to the social
reintegration program.

05:15.848 --> 05:18.785
If Kelvin doesn't show up
on Tuesday morning

05:18.851 --> 05:20.553
at Guarulhos prison,

05:22.255 --> 05:23.623
he's going to be in big trouble.

05:23.690 --> 05:26.259
I checked in the morgue
and in the hospitals.

05:26.759 --> 05:27.927
There's no trace of Kelvin

05:27.994 --> 05:31.064
or anyone
with his same features.

05:31.664 --> 05:34.233
I found some old online videos
of Kelvin.

05:34.300 --> 05:36.069
He's good at Slam poetry.

05:36.135 --> 05:37.103
What is Slam poetry?

05:38.738 --> 05:40.273
Right, you are
from another social class.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.709
Slam poetry
is an act of resistance

05:42.775 --> 05:44.110
of contemporary poets.

05:44.444 --> 05:45.411
It's very nice.

05:45.845 --> 05:47.447
I've tried Slam poetry,
you know?

05:48.147 --> 05:49.282
That's great, Tai.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.950
-Let me show you.
-Yes, let's watch one.

05:51.718 --> 05:52.685
This is Kelvin.

05:52.985 --> 05:55.288
Like absent kids,
I was almost shot

05:55.355 --> 05:57.590
I created a new point of view
That's why I'm alive

05:57.657 --> 06:01.227
Every 23 minutes, a genocide
hits the child of a lady

06:01.294 --> 06:03.596
Poetry doesn't condemn.
It tells and...

06:03.663 --> 06:05.531
-He's good, isn't he?
-Very good.

06:06.332 --> 06:07.667
A happy nation without poverty.

06:07.734 --> 06:10.103
I'm looking for my peace
for the sake of...

06:10.169 --> 06:12.939
Is this going to help us
find Kelvin?

06:15.441 --> 06:16.409
Come here, Tomás.

06:17.176 --> 06:18.511
Kelvin's been in jail
for three years

06:18.578 --> 06:19.946
and is going to be released
in three months.

06:20.012 --> 06:21.914
That if he didn't drown.

06:21.981 --> 06:24.317
Right. I haven't found much
in his cell phone.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.451
He has no reception.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.156
We want the contact
of the girl that was with you.

06:30.223 --> 06:33.493
-Sure, but...
-I get it, kid.

06:33.559 --> 06:34.727
You were cheating
on your girlfriends,

06:34.794 --> 06:36.396
and they cannot find out.

06:36.462 --> 06:38.197
Are you crazy, man?
My girlfriend is great.

06:38.264 --> 06:40.199
-Give us her number!
-I called her.

06:40.266 --> 06:41.401
She didn't answer.

06:41.467 --> 06:43.002
Let the professionals
check that.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.971
If there's dial tone,
he has reception.

06:45.037 --> 06:46.272
Where shall I go, Tai?

06:46.672 --> 06:47.673
I'll tell you in a minute.

06:51.744 --> 06:52.712
What about me?

06:53.913 --> 06:55.715
You go with them.
Come on, quickly!

07:06.459 --> 07:07.427
Raul?

07:08.694 --> 07:09.962
Tai says the cell phone's signal
is coming from around here.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.368
What is that?

07:18.604 --> 07:19.772
The boat we rented.

07:51.871 --> 07:53.439
Luckily, I don't see any blood.

07:57.243 --> 07:58.211
I found it.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.950
This has to be
the girl's cell phone.

08:06.853 --> 08:07.820
Check that out.

08:08.354 --> 08:10.156
I see different tracks.

08:11.424 --> 08:12.391
That's good, right?

08:12.892 --> 08:15.394
It means nobody drowned.
They made it alive to shore.

08:18.965 --> 08:20.766
Tomás, I need
this girl's address.

08:20.833 --> 08:23.202
-Sure, but...
-But? Stop saying "but".

08:23.936 --> 08:26.506
I know the girl's a prostitute.
It's fine.

08:27.039 --> 08:28.741
Nathi works at Le Pigalle.

08:28.808 --> 08:29.775
The night club?

08:30.309 --> 08:31.277
I know it.

08:31.644 --> 08:32.712
It's a chic place.

08:32.778 --> 08:33.746
Yes, sure.

08:34.247 --> 08:36.449
Go talk to the girl, Waldir.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.851
Before that,
Maria Júlia is going to go

08:38.918 --> 08:40.453
to Kelvin's girlfriend's house.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.454
Tell her the address.

08:43.656 --> 08:44.624
Waldir!

08:45.057 --> 08:46.025
Write it down.

08:46.592 --> 08:47.560
Give this to her.

08:49.061 --> 08:50.463
Let's go.
The bus comes every hour.

08:51.430 --> 08:52.932
-We're taking the bus?
-What about me?

08:53.499 --> 08:56.369
Go home. Have a shower.
Put on some decent clothes.

08:56.435 --> 08:57.870
Go say sorry to your girlfriend.

08:57.937 --> 08:59.005
No, Raul.

08:59.071 --> 09:01.807
I can't go back without Kelvin.

09:01.874 --> 09:05.044
If the people from the program
find out about this, I'm doomed.

09:13.886 --> 09:14.820
Nathi?

09:15.354 --> 09:17.557
At this time,
I charge double, okay?

09:18.891 --> 09:20.626
But I think we can have fun.

09:21.294 --> 09:22.528
Where were you last night?

09:26.032 --> 09:28.834
You've been here
for, what, 30 seconds

09:28.901 --> 09:30.002
and you're jealous already?

09:31.837 --> 09:32.805
Nice shirt.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.142
Nice shoes.
It's what I imagined.

09:36.208 --> 09:37.343
You must be a cop.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.711
I'm not a cop.

09:38.778 --> 09:41.847
I'm here because I need to know
what happened yesterday.

09:43.783 --> 09:45.084
Why would I talk to you?

09:51.490 --> 09:52.558
Where did you find it?

09:52.625 --> 09:54.360
Tell me why I found
your cell phone

09:54.427 --> 09:55.928
it a boat at a dam.

09:56.662 --> 09:57.630
Give it to me.

09:58.698 --> 10:00.266
I need to know
what happened yesterday.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.101
-Where's Kelvin?
-I have nothing to do with him.

10:02.168 --> 10:03.536
I just did my job.

10:03.603 --> 10:04.804
He's in danger.

10:04.870 --> 10:07.640
Anything you know about him,
you need to tell me, Nathi.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.911
It seems you're very smart
when it comes to doing your job.

10:12.812 --> 10:15.014
Then you know
I can't get in trouble.

10:15.081 --> 10:18.217
Those kids were crazy.
I have nothing to do with that.

10:18.284 --> 10:19.318
Give me my cell phone back.

10:20.987 --> 10:21.921
Give it to me.

10:23.556 --> 10:24.523
Clayton!

10:24.991 --> 10:25.958
Can you help me?

10:27.193 --> 10:28.728
This over possessive client
wants to poke around my phone.

10:29.495 --> 10:31.697
-There's no need to do this!
-Come on, give it back.

10:32.798 --> 10:35.434
I'll let you get away with this
to show you I came in peace.

10:35.501 --> 10:37.136
Besides, I'm five years older.

10:39.071 --> 10:40.172
Wait!

11:05.665 --> 11:08.634
Do we need to stop everywhere?

11:08.701 --> 11:09.835
Do you have a better idea?

11:12.104 --> 11:15.207
Hey, man!
I need some information

11:15.808 --> 11:18.644
Have you seen this guy?

11:20.479 --> 11:23.683
Yes, he was here
at around 6 a.m.

11:23.749 --> 11:25.284
My shift
was just getting started.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.019
Was he on his own? Was he okay?

11:27.086 --> 11:28.287
He was acting a little weird.

11:29.288 --> 11:31.657
He bought some cigarettes
and lit one up before leaving.

11:31.724 --> 11:34.427
I told him off.
This could explode.

11:35.394 --> 11:36.729
Why do you say
he was acting weird?

11:37.163 --> 11:38.297
He kept looking
on every direction,

11:38.364 --> 11:39.632
like he was being followed.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.967
The strangest thing
was the Chevette.

11:42.968 --> 11:43.969
The Chevette?

11:44.270 --> 11:46.338
He arrived by a Chevette
and left on foot.

11:46.405 --> 11:47.373
He left it there.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.008
At the tire repair shop.

11:50.910 --> 11:51.877
Thank you.

11:52.178 --> 11:53.412
No worries. Good luck.

12:08.360 --> 12:09.428
I get it.

12:09.495 --> 12:11.630
It's a social coexistence
project.

12:15.634 --> 12:17.770
Okay, good.

12:17.837 --> 12:19.739
I can do this. Thanks, Tai.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.794
I'm sorry for coming by
without notice.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.163
I need to talk to Kelvin.

12:45.097 --> 12:46.432
To know how he's doing.

12:47.066 --> 12:49.535
You're from that nice project
he's involved in.

12:49.602 --> 12:53.005
Right. I'm interviewing the kids
to see how they are doing

12:53.072 --> 12:56.709
with the reintegration
and the new life ahead of them.

12:56.776 --> 13:00.613
Don't worry. Kelvin is making
a lot of Slam and online videos.

13:00.679 --> 13:03.415
I saw that. He's very talented.

13:04.216 --> 13:05.484
Come in, please.

13:05.551 --> 13:06.952
How many months pregnant
are you?

13:07.853 --> 13:09.488
Twenty eight weeks.

13:09.555 --> 13:10.523
Amazing!

13:10.890 --> 13:11.957
Yes, I'm almost there.

13:14.226 --> 13:15.661
We're naming our son Emeci.

13:16.695 --> 13:17.663
Nice.

13:19.165 --> 13:20.132
So...

13:20.933 --> 13:22.968
Is Kelvin home?

13:25.070 --> 13:26.038
He is.

13:26.438 --> 13:29.108
I searched the car,
but I found nothing from Kelvin.

13:29.175 --> 13:31.644
Are you sure you don't know
anything about that car?

13:31.710 --> 13:33.646
That car is not Kelvin's style.

13:33.712 --> 13:35.681
He left the car there
and left on foot.

13:37.016 --> 13:40.252
Even though I told him off,
he left a good tip.

13:42.588 --> 13:44.056
A client arrived.
I'll go assist them.

13:44.123 --> 13:47.026
You can do what you want.
Your friend paid me already.

13:47.092 --> 13:48.060
And well!

13:52.798 --> 13:54.066
Where did he get the money?

13:55.034 --> 13:56.502
Is that why he was sentenced?

13:57.002 --> 13:58.504
I don't know.

14:04.710 --> 14:06.412
You want your friend back,
don't you?

14:07.246 --> 14:08.280
Speak.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.420
Kelvin was sentenced
for being involved

14:14.486 --> 14:16.255
in some ATM explosions.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.592
But he just gave the money
to a friend of his, who did it.

14:20.659 --> 14:21.627
That friend...

14:22.728 --> 14:25.197
The money belonged to him
and now he's in jail?

14:25.264 --> 14:26.332
-Miojo?
-Yes.

14:26.398 --> 14:27.867
No, man. He just kept the money.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.002
Kelvin took charge
and got screwed.

14:31.403 --> 14:33.973
It's so unfair.
Miojo is quite dangerous.

14:35.341 --> 14:37.610
Boss! I was filling
a client's tank

14:37.676 --> 14:40.412
when a man arrived
and got into the Chevette.

14:40.479 --> 14:41.947
I couldn't see how he was,
but there is someone inside.

14:42.014 --> 14:42.982
Let's go.

14:45.184 --> 14:46.151
Tell me the truth.

14:47.887 --> 14:48.954
Is Kelvin home or not?

14:52.558 --> 14:54.360
I'm sorry for lying.

14:55.461 --> 14:56.428
No, he's not.

14:58.664 --> 15:01.600
He can't mess up,
and I'm really worried.

15:02.534 --> 15:03.669
I'll tell you the truth.

15:04.169 --> 15:05.204
Okay?

15:06.505 --> 15:09.808
I work for "Ausentes", an agency
that looks for missing people.

15:10.776 --> 15:12.378
Kelvin disappeared earlier.

15:12.444 --> 15:13.979
Tomás hired us.

15:14.046 --> 15:16.515
-Where is Kelvin?
-We're working on it.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.717
Leave, get out of my house!

15:18.784 --> 15:21.453
You lied to me. Get out of here!

15:21.520 --> 15:23.722
I know how you feel.
I just want to help. Sit down.

15:25.624 --> 15:27.493
This is the card
of the agency I work for.

15:28.394 --> 15:31.497
Call Tai. You can confirm
what I'm saying.

15:32.498 --> 15:33.465
Listen.

15:34.400 --> 15:37.303
I'm here to try and find him
before things get worse.

15:39.838 --> 15:42.708
He left with Tomás, his friend.
They were going to do something.

15:43.442 --> 15:46.378
I've been trying to reach him
for hours.

15:47.379 --> 15:49.081
When did you last talk to him?

15:50.983 --> 15:53.018
Last night at 11 p.m.

15:56.889 --> 15:58.023
This is unbelievable.

15:59.391 --> 16:01.894
Life's been a living hell
for the last three years.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.530
All those conjugal visits
for nothing!

16:05.731 --> 16:07.433
You're not going
to lose him, Lucilene.

16:08.367 --> 16:09.435
You need to find him.

16:10.135 --> 16:12.304
You need to find him
before Tuesday

16:12.371 --> 16:13.939
and take him to the prison,
okay?

16:14.006 --> 16:15.407
I'm going to find him.

16:15.474 --> 16:16.709
Otherwise, he's going to be
in big trouble.

16:16.775 --> 16:18.310
I'm going to find him. Calm.

16:35.227 --> 16:36.562
You've got a strong grip!

16:38.497 --> 16:40.099
What are you doing here
once again?

16:40.165 --> 16:41.200
Surprise!

16:42.067 --> 16:43.102
What's wrong with you?

16:43.168 --> 16:45.237
-I told you I won't talk to you.
-Wait!

16:45.938 --> 16:47.706
Stop it. Listen to me.

16:48.207 --> 16:50.309
Do people really
like being whipped with this?

16:52.311 --> 16:53.278
You don't like it?

16:55.581 --> 16:57.282
Waldir Mendes?

16:57.349 --> 16:59.551
That's me.
Listen, let's get to the point.

17:01.053 --> 17:02.755
Why don't you tell me
what you know

17:03.455 --> 17:05.391
and get this done quickly?

17:07.760 --> 17:08.961
I don't feel
like letting you go.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.496
Curious, right?

17:10.562 --> 17:11.663
You paid already, didn't you?

17:12.031 --> 17:13.065
And a lot.

17:13.966 --> 17:15.467
Don't you want to get
what you paid for?

17:17.069 --> 17:18.437
What? You're a sadist!

17:19.004 --> 17:20.739
Get away from me!

17:22.040 --> 17:24.042
Look, let's settle this.

17:32.084 --> 17:34.420
Here. That's all I have.
Take it or leave it.

17:45.964 --> 17:47.066
You won't give up, right?

17:48.500 --> 17:50.869
-Right?
-I'm not used to giving up.

17:51.370 --> 17:52.337
I see.

17:54.306 --> 17:55.274
Okay.

17:55.874 --> 17:59.011
I've had some convicts
as clients, but...

18:00.712 --> 18:03.248
Those two were crazy.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.951
They offered me more money.

18:07.786 --> 18:08.720
And then?

18:09.755 --> 18:10.722
And then...

18:11.223 --> 18:13.759
we went sailing.

18:14.526 --> 18:16.862
We stopped at a small island.

18:17.663 --> 18:19.431
-We had some drinks.
-Okay.

18:20.466 --> 18:21.433
And I had sex with them.

18:24.803 --> 18:25.771
You had sex with them?

18:27.172 --> 18:29.808
And why did you leave
the island?

18:31.743 --> 18:32.711
On your knees!

18:35.280 --> 18:37.249
Easy. Calm down.

18:39.418 --> 18:40.853
After that, this Kelvin boy

18:41.520 --> 18:42.721
went mad.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.389
How did you get lost?

18:52.097 --> 18:53.065
Come on.

19:02.608 --> 19:05.677
We stayed there.
We smoked, looking at the moon.

19:06.612 --> 19:08.814
Then Kelvin decided
to jump into the water

19:08.881 --> 19:10.549
and couldn't get to climb
back into the boat.

19:11.650 --> 19:12.618
And?

19:15.821 --> 19:16.788
Open your mouth.

19:17.923 --> 19:19.725
Open your mouth.

19:21.293 --> 19:22.261
More.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.598
What the hell? Are you insane?

19:28.734 --> 19:30.235
I helped him.

19:30.903 --> 19:33.105
I tried to start the engine,
but it didn't work.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.542
So we drifted in the darkness.

19:36.608 --> 19:38.343
It was scary and awful.

19:38.410 --> 19:39.678
How did you get out of there?

19:40.546 --> 19:42.014
We got to the shore.

19:42.080 --> 19:43.715
I didn't see him.
I just ran away.

19:45.751 --> 19:49.354
He said he had to get some money
from his friend's house.

19:49.955 --> 19:50.923
A lot of money, actually.

19:51.490 --> 19:52.758
Did you see where he went?

19:54.092 --> 19:56.528
No, babe. I promise.

19:57.196 --> 20:00.599
I ran until I got
to the nearest road.

20:01.233 --> 20:02.434
I asked the taxi driver

20:03.035 --> 20:06.004
to take me home, you know?

20:06.605 --> 20:09.441
Did he say something else
about his friend or the money?

20:13.378 --> 20:14.513
No.

20:14.580 --> 20:16.248
I'd love to trust you.

20:21.853 --> 20:23.021
You can trust me.

20:23.889 --> 20:24.856
Handsome!

20:25.357 --> 20:26.325
Can I?

20:27.526 --> 20:28.493
Really?

20:43.041 --> 20:44.343
Luckily,
there's nothing missing.

20:44.409 --> 20:47.512
What a bastard!
These things only happen to me.

20:47.579 --> 20:49.481
Hi. Is that your car?

20:49.548 --> 20:52.918
That bastard dented my car
here and there.

20:52.985 --> 20:55.754
It's my grandpa's car.
He's going to kill me, damn it!

20:55.821 --> 20:58.323
This is unbelievable, man.

20:58.390 --> 21:00.692
Hey, does this guy have
something to do with this?

21:01.727 --> 21:03.528
That's the bastard
that stole my car!

21:04.997 --> 21:06.198
Wait. Elaborate on that.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.332
Why would I do that?

21:07.399 --> 21:09.534
Are you from the insurance
company?

21:09.601 --> 21:12.671
Clam. That's my friend,
and he could be in danger.

21:12.738 --> 21:14.239
Help us, please.

21:14.573 --> 21:15.641
If that's what you want.

21:16.575 --> 21:17.542
Okay.

21:18.043 --> 21:20.879
I was driving by the dam,
you know?

21:20.946 --> 21:22.147
I was just chilling.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.150
I was listening to Blitz.
Do you know them?

21:25.217 --> 21:26.351
Evandro Mesquita?

21:27.119 --> 21:29.721
This guy suddenly
jumped out the bushes,

21:29.788 --> 21:31.256
in front of my car.

21:31.323 --> 21:34.926
He was all wet, desperate.
I nearly ran over him.

21:34.993 --> 21:36.061
He got into the car,

21:36.128 --> 21:38.463
said he was escaping
from someone,

21:38.530 --> 21:39.798
he was going to get killed.

21:39.865 --> 21:42.701
I freaked out and accelerated.

21:42.768 --> 21:45.003
Such a crazy story. And then?

21:45.070 --> 21:47.539
Then he grabbed the handbrake,

21:47.606 --> 21:49.341
he pushed me out of the car
and drove off.

21:49.408 --> 21:51.543
That bastard stole my car!

21:51.610 --> 21:52.678
Did he say anything else?

21:52.744 --> 21:53.845
No, nothing.

21:53.912 --> 21:57.683
I'm late for Luquinhas'
birthday party. Damn it!

21:57.749 --> 21:58.950
Damn it!

22:26.144 --> 22:28.513
Someone must be after Kelvin.

22:29.081 --> 22:30.782
That friend of his maybe?

22:30.849 --> 22:31.883
-Miojo?
-Yes.

22:33.418 --> 22:34.386
I don't know, man.

22:38.290 --> 22:39.358
Waldir?

22:39.424 --> 22:41.793
I dropped Tomás off halfway.

22:41.860 --> 22:45.130
He's staying with a friend
until everything is sorted.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.032
I got some information
from Nathi.

22:47.699 --> 22:50.469
Kelvin was pretty crazy.

22:50.535 --> 22:52.104
He had a lot of money

22:52.170 --> 22:54.005
and was on his way
to get some more.

22:54.072 --> 22:55.507
You sound great, Waldir.

22:55.907 --> 22:57.442
This job is good for you.

22:58.210 --> 23:02.013
I'll send you the address
in Jardim Alfredo.

23:02.314 --> 23:04.082
Find a guy called Miojo.

23:04.149 --> 23:06.351
Tomás said
he lives near the cliff.

23:06.418 --> 23:07.486
Everybody knows him.

23:07.552 --> 23:09.588
That's the guy
that is keeping Kelvin's money.

23:09.654 --> 23:10.822
I'll be right there.

23:29.007 --> 23:30.308
-Hi!
-Hi.

23:30.942 --> 23:32.511
Do you know
where I can find Miojo?

23:32.577 --> 23:33.812
He's in your face!

23:35.814 --> 23:36.882
Miojo, man?

23:36.948 --> 23:39.117
I see you're very spirited.

23:40.051 --> 23:42.854
Where is Miojo?
Maybe this helps you remember.

23:43.688 --> 23:45.791
Do you remember now?

24:03.842 --> 24:04.810
Come on, Raul.

24:05.377 --> 24:06.745
Enough for today!

24:06.812 --> 24:08.447
We've got a lot to do tomorrow.

24:09.915 --> 24:10.882
You go, Dama.

24:12.150 --> 24:13.819
I'll finish some documents.
I want to get ahead on work.

24:15.954 --> 24:18.023
-I mean it, Raul.
-You go.

24:58.730 --> 25:01.433
OFFICER RAUL FAGNANI'S DAUGHTER
GONE MISSING

25:26.057 --> 25:27.025
Lorena!

26:04.696 --> 26:06.932
I would invite you in, but...

26:15.373 --> 26:16.808
You haven't come here
to argue, right?

26:18.310 --> 26:19.377
Listen.

26:19.444 --> 26:21.546
I have to do like
20 medical analysis tomorrow.

26:21.613 --> 26:23.715
I wasn't expecting you.

26:24.616 --> 26:26.418
We didn't expect many things,
did we?

26:43.902 --> 26:45.036
It belongs to her, right?

26:47.372 --> 26:48.340
I know it does.

26:52.043 --> 26:53.011
Right?

27:00.085 --> 27:01.119
Lorena?

27:02.120 --> 27:04.723
I found this
at a deserted party house.

27:06.358 --> 27:09.995
Damasceno dismantled
an illegal adoption gang.

27:10.362 --> 27:11.429
I found it there.

27:11.830 --> 27:14.232
There's no DNA on it.
There's nothing, but...

27:14.299 --> 27:15.433
It belongs to her.

27:16.801 --> 27:18.236
-You know it does.
-Raul!

27:19.537 --> 27:21.773
If that's why you came,
just leave!

27:22.507 --> 27:23.475
Go!

27:24.776 --> 27:25.844
It belongs to her.

27:27.312 --> 27:28.847
I know it does, and you too.

27:28.913 --> 27:32.283
This is the toy she had
when she was taken from us!

27:33.518 --> 27:35.754
Raul, stop this.
You'll ruin your life.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.288
It is ruined already!

27:38.089 --> 27:39.057
It is ruined.

27:39.791 --> 27:41.092
But I'm not getting crazy.

27:42.293 --> 27:45.030
I'm not. This belongs to her,
and you know it does.

27:45.096 --> 27:46.498
-Tell me it doesn't.
-Does it even matter?

27:46.564 --> 27:48.566
What does it mean?
Is it going to change anything?

27:48.633 --> 27:49.601
What?

27:50.735 --> 27:54.205
This... She was there!

27:54.272 --> 27:55.440
Listen.

27:58.476 --> 28:00.278
She needs us.

28:03.048 --> 28:04.015
She's alive!

28:04.416 --> 28:08.286
Stop it. Go! Leave me alone! Go!

28:08.353 --> 28:09.320
Leave me alone!

28:39.551 --> 28:40.852
I'm sorry, I...

28:42.320 --> 28:43.688
I didn't mean to.

28:59.771 --> 29:00.805
I was...

29:01.840 --> 29:05.043
awake all night.

29:05.110 --> 29:06.144
I could...

29:07.378 --> 29:11.082
be with you.

29:13.852 --> 29:14.819
Sweetheart.

29:24.429 --> 29:25.930
-How is Evinha?
-Thanks, Raul.

29:25.997 --> 29:28.133
She's fine, kind of.

29:28.199 --> 29:30.168
She suffers from night terrors.

29:30.235 --> 29:31.369
She wakes up
in the middle of the night

29:31.436 --> 29:33.104
and speaks nonsense.

29:34.038 --> 29:35.073
It's quite weird.

29:36.474 --> 29:37.442
Hi, Raul.

29:38.309 --> 29:39.277
Hi.

29:43.148 --> 29:44.883
More people pressuring us

29:44.949 --> 29:46.651
is the last thing I need
right now.

29:46.718 --> 29:48.453
Calm. It's important.

29:48.520 --> 29:51.422
She's Lucilene,
Kelvin's girlfriend.

29:52.157 --> 29:53.358
You are Raul, aren't you?

29:54.292 --> 29:55.927
I need to show you something.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.563
Kelvin sent this to me
early in the morning.

29:59.364 --> 30:00.632
From an unknown number.

30:00.698 --> 30:03.067
Love, I'll buy everything
for the baby.

30:03.134 --> 30:04.335
I'll be with you soon.

30:04.402 --> 30:07.639
I've been trying to call him,
but he has no reception.

30:07.705 --> 30:09.007
Don't worry, okay?

30:09.073 --> 30:10.975
-They are going to find me!
-Give it back!

30:12.510 --> 30:14.979
If they find me, I'm done.
They are coming!

30:15.046 --> 30:17.248
Who is he escaping from?

30:17.782 --> 30:18.883
Who is that woman?

30:19.417 --> 30:22.620
We were going to buy everything
for the baby today.

30:22.687 --> 30:23.721
Calm, Lucilene.

30:25.657 --> 30:28.426
Has Kelvin ever showed signs
of a mental health issue?

30:30.962 --> 30:31.930
No.

30:32.530 --> 30:33.598
Never.

30:33.665 --> 30:34.632
Tai!

30:35.967 --> 30:37.302
Transfer this to your computer.

30:37.902 --> 30:39.237
-Zoom in the woman.
-Raul?

30:39.304 --> 30:40.738
I need to go back home.

30:40.805 --> 30:43.374
I want to sleep on a decent bed
before coming back to jail.

30:43.441 --> 30:44.976
You need to find Kelvin.

30:45.043 --> 30:46.945
Look, Raul. This is it, right?

30:47.512 --> 30:48.713
This is what you're looking for?

30:59.290 --> 31:01.192
Waldir is after Miojo.

31:01.659 --> 31:04.596
If he's involved,
we will find out.

31:06.764 --> 31:07.765
What's wrong?

31:10.602 --> 31:13.338
Is everything okay?
Is something bothering you?

31:13.938 --> 31:15.006
No.

31:15.073 --> 31:16.140
When it comes to these cases,

31:16.207 --> 31:17.742
I sometimes
don't know what to do.

31:18.743 --> 31:20.812
At least this case has a chance.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.247
There's evidence.
It's still warm.

31:22.313 --> 31:24.515
The problem is
when the cases are cold,

31:24.582 --> 31:25.650
when nobody comes back.

31:27.185 --> 31:28.887
-Let's go.
-It's here, right?

31:50.341 --> 31:51.309
Excuse me.

31:53.244 --> 31:54.212
Excuse me!

31:57.015 --> 31:57.982
Hi.

31:58.316 --> 31:59.284
How are you, madam?

31:59.884 --> 32:01.552
I'm looking for someone...

32:01.619 --> 32:05.356
Don't call me "madam".
I have a name.

32:05.423 --> 32:07.191
I'm Mrs. Cleide, please.

32:07.258 --> 32:08.426
I'm sorry, Mrs. Cleide.

32:10.828 --> 32:11.796
Look.

32:12.263 --> 32:13.498
He's my brother.

32:16.034 --> 32:17.201
He's never been here.

32:17.869 --> 32:18.836
Never.

32:19.604 --> 32:22.106
Listen, Mrs. Cleide, right?

32:22.173 --> 32:24.275
We've been trying to reach him.

32:24.342 --> 32:26.177
I need to talk to him.

32:26.244 --> 32:27.512
Hey, kid!

32:29.881 --> 32:31.149
I'm sorry.

32:31.215 --> 32:32.917
This isn't your house.
-I'm sorry.

32:32.984 --> 32:35.586
I called him several times,
but he wouldn't answer.

32:35.653 --> 32:39.891
My mom is in the hospital.
I need to talk to him urgently.

32:43.127 --> 32:45.063
With some drinks,

32:45.129 --> 32:47.332
we'll be able to talk better.

32:47.398 --> 32:48.900
Yes, sure.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.114
He was here.

33:03.614 --> 33:06.250
He had a fight with Marli.

33:06.317 --> 33:07.552
What kind of fight?

33:07.618 --> 33:11.189
He came unafraid,
said two men were after him.

33:11.255 --> 33:13.725
Then he sat down back there.
He drank a bit.

33:13.791 --> 33:14.926
He met Marli.

33:15.827 --> 33:18.429
And then they got a room.

33:18.496 --> 33:21.332
She wouldn't get paid
just for playing pool.

33:24.068 --> 33:26.304
Early in the morning,
Marli started screaming

33:26.371 --> 33:28.172
because he stole her phone.

33:28.239 --> 33:31.242
When she tried to get it back,
he ran away.

33:31.309 --> 33:34.846
I went to see what was going on,
but he had already left.

33:35.546 --> 33:39.350
Luckily, he paid in cash
in advance.

33:40.385 --> 33:42.653
Marli's phone is missing.

33:44.422 --> 33:45.390
Restrooms?

33:45.957 --> 33:48.059
Straight,
last door down the corridor.

33:51.796 --> 33:53.031
Thank you, Mrs. Cleide.

34:40.144 --> 34:42.814
DO NOT FLUSH FEMININE PRODUCTS
IN TOILETS

36:20.611 --> 36:22.146
Are you feeling okay?

36:22.213 --> 36:23.247
Never better.

36:24.315 --> 36:26.551
-Are you sure?
-But Kelvin is in danger.

36:26.617 --> 36:29.120
-Why?
-I've just given Mrs. Cleide

36:29.187 --> 36:30.988
the cell phone he used
to make the video.

36:31.055 --> 36:33.124
It was behind a toilet
in a restroom stall.

36:33.591 --> 36:34.959
It's strange. Now...

36:38.062 --> 36:40.765
Did you get anything else
from Miss Congeniality?

36:41.265 --> 36:43.568
He said two guys
entered the place

36:43.634 --> 36:44.936
after Kelvin left.

36:45.002 --> 36:46.537
They played and left.

36:46.604 --> 36:47.805
They weren't after him.

36:50.341 --> 36:53.744
Why did he escape
through the restroom's window?

36:54.145 --> 36:55.980
He fell on the ground here
from that window.

36:56.447 --> 36:58.816
He must have jumped
over the grill.

36:58.883 --> 37:00.051
Yes.

37:00.117 --> 37:01.385
Now, the question is,

37:02.320 --> 37:03.688
why did he run away?

37:04.488 --> 37:05.957
Who is chasing him?

37:11.028 --> 37:13.598
You messed up
talking to the cops.

37:13.664 --> 37:15.633
Did you think
you'd get away with this?

37:15.700 --> 37:18.336
You have to pay.
You have to pay, you clown!

37:18.402 --> 37:21.339
It's over! Put your gun down
or I'll kill him.

37:22.440 --> 37:24.542
Why would you do that?
You're in my house, man.

37:24.609 --> 37:26.911
If I shoot you,
I act on self-defense!

37:26.978 --> 37:28.346
I've got five man outside.

37:28.412 --> 37:29.947
Shall I give the order
for them to enter?

37:31.349 --> 37:33.551
Listen up, Pereira!
Shall I give the order?

37:35.186 --> 37:36.487
Shall I? Shall I give the order?

37:36.554 --> 37:38.289
I don't want any trouble
with the police.

37:38.356 --> 37:41.492
Put your gun down now!
You too! Put it down!

37:42.660 --> 37:43.628
Come here.

37:45.663 --> 37:47.231
-I'm looking for Kelvin.
-What?

37:47.832 --> 37:49.233
Shut your mouth!

37:58.643 --> 38:00.978
Where the hell is Kelvin?
Where the hell is he?

38:01.045 --> 38:02.346
You tell me.

38:02.413 --> 38:05.082
He was supposed to come
and play videogames with us.

38:05.149 --> 38:06.150
What's going on?

38:06.617 --> 38:07.585
Pereira?

38:08.653 --> 38:09.620
Abort mission.

38:09.954 --> 38:12.356
I repeat.
Abort the damn mission.

38:17.561 --> 38:18.529
Hi, Waldir.

38:20.698 --> 38:22.033
You found nothing at Miojo's?

38:25.269 --> 38:26.771
No, what about the money?

38:28.839 --> 38:29.807
Okay.

38:30.474 --> 38:32.410
-What about Miojo?
-Not involved.

38:33.611 --> 38:35.112
This case is very strange, Raul.

38:35.713 --> 38:37.915
First, Kelvin disappears
on a boat.

38:38.683 --> 38:41.352
Then he steals the car
of a stoner clown.

38:41.419 --> 38:43.487
He disrupts the pool bar.

38:43.554 --> 38:47.024
Everywhere he goes,
he says he's being chased.

38:47.558 --> 38:49.894
The only one person
that can be chasing him,

38:49.960 --> 38:51.729
Miojo, is not involved
in this case.

38:52.530 --> 38:53.597
He's crazy.

38:54.131 --> 38:55.099
Insane!

38:56.400 --> 38:57.902
He's having a psychotic episode!

38:57.968 --> 39:01.272
Yes, and there's this video
he sent to his girlfriend.

39:01.339 --> 39:02.940
He talked about buying things
for the baby.

39:03.774 --> 39:05.643
Nothing seems to make any sense.

39:07.011 --> 39:09.580
Because his head
doesn't make any sense.

39:09.647 --> 39:11.682
He's completely confused.

39:11.749 --> 39:13.851
Tomás said they had some drugs.

39:13.918 --> 39:15.319
-Yes.
-So...

39:16.287 --> 39:18.556
He must be having a bad trip.

39:18.622 --> 39:20.391
He's having a psychotic episode.

39:21.892 --> 39:22.860
That's it!

39:25.129 --> 39:26.764
Where are you going? Raul?

39:34.171 --> 39:35.239
A baby store?

39:38.275 --> 39:39.343
He's not escaping.

39:41.445 --> 39:42.947
He's trying to go home.

39:44.348 --> 39:47.351
A regretful man
that knows he messed up...

39:47.418 --> 39:49.954
Buys a gift
for her pregnant partner.

39:52.556 --> 39:53.524
Maybe.

40:25.890 --> 40:26.891
Is it open?

40:28.559 --> 40:29.527
Yes.

41:07.765 --> 41:08.732
It's him.

41:13.671 --> 41:14.638
Emeci?

41:16.240 --> 41:18.275
Are you there?
Do you even care?

41:18.909 --> 41:21.011
I fight for love today,
but pain will go away

41:21.512 --> 41:23.080
Resentment is burning

41:23.814 --> 41:25.516
But hope will soon be shining

41:27.651 --> 41:29.053
Calm, Kelvin.

41:29.520 --> 41:30.588
We're here to help.

41:31.155 --> 41:32.923
-That's right.
-We'll take you home.

41:33.757 --> 41:34.725
-Come here.
-Come.

41:35.826 --> 41:36.794
Come with us.

41:44.502 --> 41:45.469
His shoes.

41:49.640 --> 41:50.608
Let's go, Raul.

42:12.062 --> 42:14.765
I'm sure you want to buy me
a cappuccino

42:14.832 --> 42:17.434
with a lot of whipped cream.

42:17.501 --> 42:20.037
I think this is not
what you expected, but...

42:20.104 --> 42:23.207
It seems that Guzman,
the man that's after your dad,

42:23.274 --> 42:24.441
has a clean record.

42:24.909 --> 42:27.144
He has a family,
children and a wife.

42:27.211 --> 42:29.246
He's legally working
in this country.

42:29.747 --> 42:30.981
He's a working immigrant.

42:31.048 --> 42:33.584
Why was he looking for my dad
in that apartment?

42:33.918 --> 42:36.353
He has to be involved
in my dad's disappearance.

42:36.420 --> 42:39.523
What if there is somebody
above him?

42:39.590 --> 42:41.759
A superior, maybe.

42:41.825 --> 42:43.227
-A boss.
-Exactly.

42:44.495 --> 42:45.462
Can you do that?

42:46.931 --> 42:49.133
What's going on with Waldir?

42:49.800 --> 42:52.603
Do you know
if his son is in trouble again?

42:53.404 --> 42:55.940
God gives the worst battles
to his best warriors.

42:56.006 --> 42:57.107
What's wrong with his son?

42:57.708 --> 42:59.710
I think you could talk about it.

43:00.578 --> 43:02.346
Waldir tried everything
with Rafa.

43:02.680 --> 43:05.516
Spiritual retreats,
psychological support.

43:05.583 --> 43:06.817
Rehab, but...

43:07.885 --> 43:09.787
Rafa's situation
is very difficult.

43:10.521 --> 43:11.589
-Raul?
-Tell me.

43:11.655 --> 43:12.790
Can we talk?

43:16.193 --> 43:17.861
Poor man!

43:17.928 --> 43:19.563
-Tell me.
-I don't know how to explain it.

43:20.130 --> 43:21.098
What, Waldir?

43:21.799 --> 43:23.801
When you send a message
to a woman,

43:23.867 --> 43:25.002
-you know?
-Yes.

43:26.103 --> 43:28.005
If she doesn't reply,
you send another one, right?

43:29.540 --> 43:31.842
Well, I've been sending messages

43:33.010 --> 43:34.144
and...

43:34.211 --> 43:36.180
-Have you sent a lot?
-Yes.

43:36.246 --> 43:38.616
She read them, but didn't reply.

43:38.682 --> 43:40.484
What does that mean?

43:41.118 --> 43:42.052
Is it over?

43:42.920 --> 43:44.288
Call her.

43:44.355 --> 43:46.423
I depends. Call her.

43:46.490 --> 43:48.525
Tell me,
what are we talking about?

43:48.592 --> 43:49.660
Does Sônia know about this?

43:49.727 --> 43:51.895
-Sônia who?
-Sônia.

43:51.962 --> 43:54.465
Raul, I don't even know
why I'm asking you.

43:54.531 --> 43:56.767
When you last wrote to a person,

43:56.834 --> 43:58.369
you must have sent them
a letter, right?

43:58.435 --> 44:00.904
-A postcard, maybe.
-Forget it, Waldir.

44:01.405 --> 44:02.373
Come in.

44:03.507 --> 44:05.876
Hi, Lucilene, how are you?

44:09.980 --> 44:11.048
Here's what we agreed upon.

44:11.115 --> 44:12.883
Thanks for helping save Kelvin.

44:13.350 --> 44:15.986
If it wasn't for you,
I don't know...

44:17.287 --> 44:18.255
Thank you.

44:19.323 --> 44:20.791
Thank you all.

44:21.525 --> 44:22.593
If he didn't come back,

44:22.660 --> 44:23.727
I don't know
what would have happened.

44:23.794 --> 44:25.329
-What a crazy day.
-I know, right?

44:27.598 --> 44:30.200
Raul, you were great.

44:30.267 --> 44:31.802
I made a Slam for this moment.

44:31.869 --> 44:34.738
The night is cold
Something is being told

44:34.805 --> 44:37.641
Some brothers are gone
Cowards lying all along

44:37.708 --> 44:39.810
You won't win
I will not give in

44:39.877 --> 44:42.980
You are a predator
But I am a gladiator

44:43.047 --> 44:44.815
I am free
That won't change, I guarantee

44:44.882 --> 44:46.984
I don't carry a gun
My friends and I just have fun

44:47.051 --> 44:49.386
People dying too soon
while walking under the moon

44:49.453 --> 44:51.622
I'll be brief
With poetry I feel relief

44:51.689 --> 44:55.693
I want peace for my son,
my girl and my mates

44:55.759 --> 44:58.595
Only the clever ones
have what it takes

44:58.662 --> 45:00.664
It's my art
It's like a dart

45:00.731 --> 45:02.332
Let go of your gun
Just read under the sun

45:02.399 --> 45:04.334
Hey, brothers, listen to me

45:04.401 --> 45:07.004
Hey, sisters, you have to see

45:07.071 --> 45:08.472
Together we will conquer

45:08.539 --> 45:11.041
Alone I almost die,
but together we will get by

45:11.108 --> 45:11.175
Alone I almost die,
but together we will get by
