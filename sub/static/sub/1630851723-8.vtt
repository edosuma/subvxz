was falling apart,

04:12.386 --> 04:15.623

or instinct told me

04:15.756 --> 04:17.491
to have a guy get it
from the morgue.

gave Elizabeth that letter
before she died,

05:24.024 --> 05:26.594
Sam Rhode.
Number eight in the world.

05:26.727 --> 05:29.597
At 36, he was playing
the best tennis
of his career.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.899
Now he's dead.
Well, there was rumors
he was juicing.

05:32.032 --> 05:34.101
I guess now we know.
Not according to Reddington.

05:34.234 --> 05:36.770
The M.E. said Rhode OD'd
on a synthetic oxygen carrier

05:36.904 --> 05:38.305
designed to increase stamina,

05:38.439 --> 05:40.140
but it gave him
a heart attack instead.

05:40.273 --> 05:43.110
The M.E.'s focused
on how Rhode died,
not why.

05:43.243 --> 05:45.178
Reddington says the "why"
involves this man,

05:45.312 --> 05:47.014
Dr. Razmik Maier.

05:47.147 --> 05:49.683
A German pharmacologist
whispered to be responsible

05:49.817 --> 05:52.386
for keeping two generations
of world-class athletes

05:52.520 --> 05:53.954
a step ahead of WADA.

05:54.087 --> 05:56.624
Giving East Germans steroids
during the Cold War,

05:56.757 --> 05:58.759
EPO to U.S. cyclists
in the '90s,

05:58.892 --> 06:00.728
and hemoglobin-based
oxygen carriers

06:00.861 --> 06:03.263
to the Russian Federation
in 2014.

06:03.397 --> 06:05.799
If Maier devoted his career
to helping athletes win

06:05.933 --> 06:08.569
and if they were
his clients,

06:08.702 --> 06:10.370
why would he suddenly
want to kill one?

06:10.504 --> 06:12.973
Because that's what
his biggest client
wants him to do.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.942
Who's bigger than
the 8th-ranked
player in the world?

06:15.075 --> 06:18.145
The Boswell Syndicate,
a family-run sports book

06:18.278 --> 06:21.248
catering to the decidedly
criminal element

06:21.381 --> 06:25.385
who are unable or unwilling
to satisfy their predilection

06:25.519 --> 06:28.889
in the betting parlors
of Vegas, Macao, or Monaco.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.658
And Maier is in business
with them?

06:30.791 --> 06:34.161
Rumor has it the Boswells,
James and Junior,

06:34.294 --> 06:36.730
pay Dr. Maier
a significant fee

06:36.864 --> 06:39.032
in exchange
for inside information,

06:39.166 --> 06:42.235
who's doping,
where they are in their cycle.

06:42.369 --> 06:44.838
Inside information
is one thing.
Murder's another.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.674
A generation ago,
the Boswells controlled

06:46.807 --> 06:48.175
the nation's sports book.

06:48.308 --> 06:50.377
But betting on sports
has exploded since then,

06:50.511 --> 06:52.079
in casinos, online.

06:52.212 --> 06:54.615
Three years ago,
the Supreme Court
struck down laws

06:54.748 --> 06:56.884
prohibiting states from
authorizing sports betting.

06:57.017 --> 06:59.520
As a result, the Boswells'
once-hefty profit margins

06:59.653 --> 07:01.221
all but evaporated.

07:01.354 --> 07:03.256
To retain business,
they cut their vig,

07:03.390 --> 07:06.393
but their ability
to survive an outcome

07:06.527 --> 07:10.363
that exposed them
to large losses
was terribly compromised.

07:10.498 --> 07:13.166
So instead of putting a finger
on the scale,

07:13.300 --> 07:16.036
I'm told they enlist
their German friend

07:16.169 --> 07:19.072
to put the full weight
of everything he knows on it.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.074
Supposedly Dr. Maier
still provides

07:21.208 --> 07:22.810
the Boswells
inside information,

07:22.943 --> 07:24.878
but, in what Reddington says
are a few select cases,

07:25.012 --> 07:27.715
he "accidentally"
overdoses a player

07:27.848 --> 07:29.617
whose performance
might wipe them out.

07:29.750 --> 07:32.285
Players like Sam Rhode
who were already working
with Maier,

07:32.419 --> 07:35.589
so it was easy to make
their murder look accidental.

07:35.723 --> 07:38.492
Aram, review Reddington's
theory with the M.E,

07:38.626 --> 07:39.760
see if it holds up.

07:39.893 --> 07:42.496
Ressler, Park,
talk to Rhode's parents.

07:42.630 --> 07:45.599
See if they know anything
about Dr. Maier.

07:45.733 --> 07:47.901
Reddington's gonna
take the lead
with the Boswells,

07:48.035 --> 07:49.402
and he asked you
to join him.

07:49.537 --> 07:51.304
Did he say why?
He did not.

07:51.438 --> 07:53.273

about the good old days?

Oh, dear.
Here I was hoping time
would heal this wound.

Bartman.

Is the Wakefield game
on the level?

11:03.030 --> 11:04.865
As far as I know.
Why?

11:04.998 --> 11:08.101
Junior, this is Kenny Mills.
We're associates.

11:08.235 --> 11:09.737
Or were, until we had

11:09.870 --> 11:11.705
a falling-out
over a mutual friend.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.707
After her death, he spiraled

11:13.841 --> 11:15.275
and, like our friend
Tannenbaum,

11:15.408 --> 11:18.411
turned in sorrow
to your fine establishment.

11:18.545 --> 11:20.447
If you check your records,
you'll see he placed

11:20.580 --> 11:25.018
a $50,000 money-line wager
on the Wakefield City match.

11:25.152 --> 11:28.655
As a down payment
on what I hope will be
our renewed friendship,

11:28.789 --> 11:30.623
I promised Kenny
I'd make sure

11:30.758 --> 11:33.927
you weren't artificially
sweetening the outcome.

Maier?

oh, at least two years.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.869
And here I've heard
you were working together.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.470
Well, you heard wrong.

11:43.603 --> 11:45.906
Whatever he's doing,
he's not doing it for me.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.541
Forgive my ignorance,
but who is Bartman?

11:48.675 --> 11:50.677
An innocent man

asking questions,

jay-walk as a kid.

She also had
a sports-medicine podcast.

16:04.231 --> 16:05.765
When I asked Sam Rhode's
parents about Maier,

16:05.898 --> 16:07.934
they assumed it was
because I had spoken
to Huang.

16:08.068 --> 16:10.003
It was clear that
she had figured out
there was a connection.

16:10.137 --> 16:12.805
Maier was so good,
the doping agencies
couldn't catch him.

16:12.939 --> 16:14.607
But Stella Huang did,

16:14.741 --> 16:16.676
so it makes sense that
he killed her because of it.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.945
So how do the Boswells
fit into this?
They don't.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.913
Raymond was right.
They did work with Maier.

16:21.048 --> 16:23.250
But that ended years ago.
Maier acted alone?

that Maier was doping
Sam Rhodes

16:25.752 --> 16:27.820

whoever killed her took it.

16:27.954 --> 16:29.389
Stella was drugged.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.524
Not a PED, but, still,
it points to Maier.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.427
I agree. She knew
about his involvement,
so he silenced her.

he didn't silence her.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.331

in the apartment?

16:38.465 --> 16:40.467
No. Or her clothes
or her car.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.635

something in her.

16:42.769 --> 16:43.970
In her?
Yeah.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.539

But not one that
could explain how

18:07.053 --> 18:09.055
You do know my marriage

to invest in you,

18:17.597 --> 18:20.099
in your problem,
in trying to fix it,

18:20.233 --> 18:22.835
which, of course, is the last
thing I should have done,

18:22.969 --> 18:24.537

cheat the drug test

you wouldn't.

18:35.182 --> 18:37.717

18:37.850 --> 18:39.686
And if you
don't help yourself,

18:39.819 --> 18:41.521
I'll tell Cooper
about the drug test.

18:41.654 --> 18:44.257
Yeah, you tell Cooper
that you helped me cheat,

18:44.391 --> 18:46.393
you're gonna be in just
as much trouble as I am.

18:46.526 --> 18:49.329
That's right. It's called
taking responsibility
for your actions.

clearly incapable of.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.301

about her,

19:44.451 --> 19:46.619
that she was alleging
he worked with Maier.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.020
He denied it, but...

19:48.154 --> 19:50.056
You believe he was doping.
I do.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.992
At his age, what he was doing.
I should have said something.

19:53.125 --> 19:56.529
But when he won,
my company won,
so I didn't.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.331
And I have to
live with that,

19:58.465 --> 20:00.132
not having the courage
to speak out against
the doping

20:00.267 --> 20:02.369
that is such a cancer
on sports.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.637

had the courage that I lack

20:04.771 --> 20:06.539
because what she was doing,
trying to expose

20:06.673 --> 20:09.276

I admire her
for doing that.

So far, no one knows,
or is willing to say
they know,

22:38.658 --> 22:40.059
anything about Maier.

22:40.192 --> 22:41.494
Well, Reddington
was wrong about
the Boswells.

about Maier, too.

there's another
explanation

22:44.931 --> 22:46.699
for why Stella Huang
was killed?

22:46.833 --> 22:47.867
Well, we have a theory
why she was killed

22:48.000 --> 22:49.802
but not an explanation.

22:49.936 --> 22:51.337
She was killed by Maier
because he was afraid
of being exposed,

22:51.471 --> 22:52.872
of being found out.

22:53.005 --> 22:54.841
DEMBE: But what about
the tennis player?

22:54.974 --> 22:57.176
You think that's reason enough
for Maier to kill an athlete

22:57.309 --> 22:59.045
when he's devoted his life
to helping them?

22:59.178 --> 23:01.781
I do. In my experience,
people will do almost anything

23:01.914 --> 23:04.316

what they're ashamed of.

in her intestinal tract,

five minutes before she died.

was so depressingly impossible

come for me, too?

That's Maier
with Walker Burgos.

are the e-mails

he worked from were paid for
