STACIE: Awesome!
MAN: Beautiful!

15:29.128 --> 15:30.789
That's incredible.

15:31.196 --> 15:33.562
Christie,
what is this place?

15:34.433 --> 15:36.196
The Tannenbaum Inn.

15:36.268 --> 15:39.533
But it is something special
around Christmas time.

15:39.705 --> 15:43.937
The Elifs and I can't help it,
we do it up every year.

15:44.710 --> 15:46.302
Elves?
Elves!

15:47.079 --> 15:48.410
I knew it!

15:48.480 --> 15:51.540
You said your name is
Christie Clauson, right?

15:52.184 --> 15:55.153
And it's the Tannenbaum Inn,
like the Christmas carol.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.450
And you have elves
making Christmas presents.

15:59.258 --> 16:00.623
This is Santa's workshop!

16:02.161 --> 16:04.129
Chelsea,
we're in Minnesota.

16:04.196 --> 16:06.426
Santa's workshop is
at the North Pole.

16:06.532 --> 16:07.931
Everyone knows that.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.157
But the elves...

16:09.868 --> 16:12.803
(CHUCKLING) Elifs!
The Elif family.

16:13.072 --> 16:14.835
That's their last name.

16:14.907 --> 16:17.398
We do a big toy drive
every Christmas,

16:17.476 --> 16:18.704
and they always
help me out.

16:19.178 --> 16:21.806
We put everything together
and wrap up the gifts,

16:21.914 --> 16:25.975
then my uncle swings by on
Christmas Eve to handle distribution.

16:26.485 --> 16:29.010
But the Elifs all
have pointy ears.

16:29.688 --> 16:31.349
Hello? Rude!

16:32.458 --> 16:34.585
It's okay.
She's right.

16:35.928 --> 16:37.020
(GASPS)

16:37.663 --> 16:41.121
I need a roll of sparkly
ribbon at table one, stat!

16:41.233 --> 16:42.632
(GIGGLING)

16:42.701 --> 16:46.762
It's a walkie-talkie. So,
this isn't Santa's workshop.

16:47.339 --> 16:48.966
CHRISTIE: Oh, sure it is!

16:49.375 --> 16:51.935
Any place where people come
together to bring Christmas to others

16:52.011 --> 16:54.639
is one of Santa's workshops.
Don't you think?

16:56.682 --> 16:59.583
So, how long will you
be staying with us?

16:59.752 --> 17:01.117
We just need one night.

17:01.186 --> 17:04.087
We're leaving first thing in the
morning to fly to New York City.

17:04.156 --> 17:09.287
How exciting. Cole, Ivy,
the best room in the house.

17:11.597 --> 17:12.790
Thanks.

17:19.771 --> 17:21.364
BARBIE: We miss you, too.

17:22.307 --> 17:24.798
Yup, Skipper booked us
on a morning flight.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.435
We'll call you
from the gate.

17:27.146 --> 17:29.114
We'll see you soon. Bye.

17:30.382 --> 17:31.940
Aunt Millie sends her love.

17:32.017 --> 17:34.815
Did she say she was excited
for the sea lion show?

17:34.887 --> 17:37.685
Did she say how much snow
there is in Central Park?

17:37.756 --> 17:40.953
SKIPPER: Did she say she's really
sorry she won't see us this trip?

17:41.026 --> 17:43.017
What? What
do you mean?

17:43.095 --> 17:45.689
I mean there's another
storm coming tonight.

17:45.764 --> 17:48.790
"Major flight cancellations
expected throughout the Midwest. "

17:49.201 --> 17:52.102
There's no way our plane's
taking off tomorrow.

17:52.171 --> 17:53.331
STACIE: But it has to.

17:53.472 --> 17:56.270
We have to get to New York
for the perfect Christmas.

17:57.142 --> 18:00.043
I think we have to kiss
the perfect Christmas goodbye.

18:00.112 --> 18:04.412
But Barbie promised. She said we'd get
to New York for Christmas. Right, Barbie?

18:06.285 --> 18:09.777
You know what? Weather
reports are wrong all the time.

18:09.855 --> 18:12.085
Our flight is first thing
in the morning.

18:12.157 --> 18:16.116
I bet we can get out and be in New
York before the storm even starts.

18:16.728 --> 18:17.786
Promise?

18:19.064 --> 18:22.295
I promise we'll have
the perfect Christmas.

18:25.003 --> 18:28.803
We should get to bed. We have
a big day ahead of us tomorrow.

18:29.808 --> 18:30.866
CHELSEA: Good night.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.205
SKIPPER: Good night.

18:32.277 --> 18:34.643
Good night, Barbie.
Good night.

19:40.712 --> 19:42.043
(BARBIE SIGHING)

19:43.348 --> 19:44.872
All this snow.

19:45.284 --> 19:48.515
And there's no way we'll
get to New York tomorrow.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.046
It'll mess up everything.

19:58.063 --> 20:02.295

Oh, Christie!
I didn't see you.

23:00.412 --> 23:01.902
I'm so sorry.
Did I wake you up?

23:02.481 --> 23:05.416
No, I was awake.
Is everything okay?

23:05.984 --> 23:08.475
You sound like
you're sad about something.

23:08.553 --> 23:10.350
(SIGHING) Christmas.

23:10.889 --> 23:13.619
(CHUCKLING) You're sad
about Christmas?

23:13.959 --> 23:16.018
No. I love Christmas.

23:16.094 --> 23:18.494
But this year, my sisters
are counting on me

23:18.563 --> 23:21.225
to get them to New York,
and I don't think I can.

23:21.299 --> 23:23.494
They're going to be so
disappointed when they wake up,

23:23.568 --> 23:25.035
and it's all my fault.

23:25.103 --> 23:26.798
It's your fault
the planes can't fly?

23:26.872 --> 23:27.998
Well, no.

23:28.340 --> 23:29.967
It's your fault
there's a snowstorm?

23:30.041 --> 23:31.133
Of course not.

23:31.410 --> 23:34.971
Then I'm confused.
What exactly is your fault?

23:35.313 --> 23:39.044
It's my fault because I told my
sisters we'd have the perfect Christmas.

23:39.117 --> 23:40.709
I promised them.

23:41.520 --> 23:44.921
Now in the morning, I'm
going to have to take it away.

23:45.056 --> 23:48.753
Hmm. I don't think you can
take away the perfect Christmas.

23:49.127 --> 23:50.492
What do you mean?

23:50.562 --> 23:55.192
Well, the perfect Christmas isn't an
object, like a dress or an ornament.

23:55.434 --> 24:00.462
It's a feeling, one you get by finding joy
in the people and things all around you.

24:00.705 --> 24:02.502
You can't take that
away from anyone.

24:02.574 --> 24:04.599
Once they find it,
it's theirs.

24:06.611 --> 24:10.342
I can think of something that
might bring you a little joy.

24:10.582 --> 24:13.483
What? You were going
to make a wish, right?

24:14.152 --> 24:16.017
Oh, that was just a song.

Our flight was canceled.

25:22.187 --> 25:23.279
Canceled?

25:23.355 --> 25:26.222
It snowed most of the night.
The runways aren't clear.

25:26.291 --> 25:28.589
They'll get us on another flight,
but they can't tell us when.

25:29.461 --> 25:32.953
But it could be soon, right?
Like in a couple hours?

25:33.665 --> 25:35.030
With so many
flights canceled,

25:35.100 --> 25:37.125
it's probably more
like a couple days.

25:37.202 --> 25:39.227
But Christmas
is tomorrow.

25:39.304 --> 25:41.602
I'll miss the special
sea lion feeding.

25:42.340 --> 25:45.070
We'll miss everything.
All of us will.

25:49.648 --> 25:52.276
We can always go to
Manhattan next Christmas.

25:52.350 --> 25:54.511
The sea lions will
still be there.

25:54.586 --> 25:58.215
So will all the ice skating,
and snowshoeing, and sledding.

25:58.290 --> 26:00.622
Yeah, but some
things won't be.

<i>A Mid-Sparkle Night's Dream won't
be playing on Broadway next year.</i>

26:04.095 --> 26:05.790
Zoe's band could even
break up by then.

26:06.298 --> 26:09.699
And Aunt Millie doesn't come
in from Paris every year.

26:11.202 --> 26:12.760
It's not fair.

26:12.837 --> 26:15.465
They can't take the perfect
Christmas away from us.

26:15.540 --> 26:16.871
They can't.

26:17.809 --> 26:19.470
Someone told me
it's impossible

26:19.544 --> 26:22.035
to take away
the perfect Christmas.

26:22.581 --> 26:25.482
It sounded good when
she said it, but now...

26:26.251 --> 26:28.776
I'm texting Zoe to let her
know I won't make it.

26:28.853 --> 26:30.218
Should I text
Aunt Millie, too?

26:30.288 --> 26:31.312
BARBIE: Yeah.

26:31.556 --> 26:35.014
Tell her we'll call her later.
And tell her Merry Christmas.

26:35.093 --> 26:37.653
(GASPING) Barbie,
what about Santa?

26:38.129 --> 26:39.494
What about Santa?

26:39.831 --> 26:41.594
We're not where
we're supposed to be.

26:41.666 --> 26:43.497
How will Santa know
how to find us?

26:43.568 --> 26:44.967
How will he get us
our presents?

26:45.604 --> 26:48.937
Come on, Chelsea. Santa
always knows where people are,

26:49.007 --> 26:50.269
no matter where it is.

26:51.042 --> 26:52.566
Right?
Right.

26:53.545 --> 26:56.673
And we can help him find us.
With our stockings.

26:57.048 --> 26:59.209
We'll hang them up
right here in the room.

26:59.284 --> 27:01.479
Where?
There's no fireplace.

27:02.153 --> 27:05.179
So we improvise.
The windowsill.

27:07.792 --> 27:11.455
There. Now Santa will know
exactly where to find us.

It was Santa's reindeer.
I know it.

I believe you.

28:14.959 --> 28:16.426
You know why?

Because I saw
Santa's reindeer, too.

You did?

45:19.850 --> 45:21.841
Animal act...
Go for it.

45:23.053 --> 45:24.577
Just me, right?

45:24.988 --> 45:28.253
No. Both of you together.
Think you can handle that?

45:29.059 --> 45:30.549
Yeah.

45:30.627 --> 45:31.958
Yeah, I guess.

45:32.863 --> 45:33.989
Cool.

45:34.164 --> 45:36.826
What are you doing
for the show, Barbie?

45:37.034 --> 45:38.126
I...

45:40.537 --> 45:43.028
You will make the popcorn
and cranberry strings.

45:43.540 --> 45:45.007
I'll... What?

45:45.509 --> 45:48.239
Yeah, decorations
totally set the scene.

45:48.812 --> 45:50.575
Think you can do it?

45:51.115 --> 45:52.309
Please?

45:54.251 --> 45:57.243
If that's where you need me,
I'm all over it.

45:58.555 --> 45:59.817
Thanks, Barbie.

46:00.524 --> 46:03.425
Okay, so I need to pick out
the direction of the stage.

46:03.494 --> 46:04.620
And decorations.

46:04.695 --> 46:06.526
Big candy canes.
Some poinsettias.

46:07.898 --> 46:09.627
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

46:12.636 --> 46:16.436

I am traveling.</i>

at the beep. Merci.</i>

(BEEPING)

46:20.544 --> 46:23.741
Hey, Aunt Millie. Storms have
flights backed up for two more days,

46:23.814 --> 46:25.076
can you believe it?

46:25.182 --> 46:27.707
(SIGHING) Wish like crazy I
was going to the play with you,

46:27.785 --> 46:30.777
but at least I still get to
see Skipper sing with a band.

46:30.854 --> 46:34.381
You'll have to check it out
later on her site. Love you.

46:39.696 --> 46:40.958
(RUDY BARKING)

46:45.202 --> 46:47.727
Hmm... I wonder how
Skipper's doing.

46:49.373 --> 46:50.806
Whoa...

46:55.279 --> 46:56.576
(SIGHING)

47:14.798 --> 47:17.926
What's going on? Isn't
the show in just two hours?

47:18.001 --> 47:22.461
Yes, but Skipper keeps going downstairs to
rehearse so she can't tell us what to do.

47:22.639 --> 47:25.665
She hasn't decided where she wants
the stage, or the red color curtains,

47:25.742 --> 47:27.141
or how many risers, or...

47:27.211 --> 47:28.872
But you don't need her
for all that, right?

47:29.246 --> 47:31.771
You know this spot. Just
do what you think is best.

47:31.849 --> 47:34.283
I would, but Skipper
won't let us.

47:34.518 --> 47:37.578
She gave us orders not to make
a single decision without her.

47:38.088 --> 47:39.214
Really?

47:39.289 --> 47:40.449
Not one.

47:40.524 --> 47:43.015
Cut it out, Stacie.
I'm telling.

47:43.560 --> 47:45.994
Barbie, Stacie's
being super-mean.

47:46.396 --> 47:48.864
I'm not. I just think
it's better if we each do

47:48.932 --> 47:50.729
our own animal acts
with the dogs.

47:51.401 --> 47:55.235
I want to be the Stupendous
Stacie, then you can do your show.

47:55.539 --> 47:57.439
You can be
Chillin'- it Chelsea.

47:58.375 --> 47:59.933
That's a dumb name.

48:00.010 --> 48:02.308
What about
Check-it-out-Chelsea?

48:02.379 --> 48:05.507
I want to do a show
together, at the same time.

48:06.683 --> 48:07.980
BOTH: Barbie!

48:08.051 --> 48:11.020
Um... I guess it's really up to Skipper.

48:11.555 --> 48:12.988
(SKIPPER GROANING)

48:13.257 --> 48:15.350
Did you want red candy
canes with white stripes

48:15.425 --> 48:16.949
or white candy canes
with red stripes?

48:17.094 --> 48:18.118
I don't know.

48:18.295 --> 48:20.195
Did you want the green
bow or the red bow?

48:20.497 --> 48:21.691
Uh... Red.

48:21.765 --> 48:24.233
No, green. It's too
much to think about.

48:24.701 --> 48:29.104
I still have to rehearse and set up
the podcast and decide on outfits...

48:29.206 --> 48:30.332
It's okay.

48:30.407 --> 48:32.341
We can decide
this stuff for you.

48:32.409 --> 48:34.240
Let us figure it out.
No.

48:34.544 --> 48:37.479
I need to do it myself.
Like Barbie.

48:37.948 --> 48:39.506
She's always...

48:40.784 --> 48:41.842
Oh!

48:46.857 --> 48:48.222
Hi, Barbie.

48:48.325 --> 48:50.657
Skipper, what do
you like better?

48:50.727 --> 48:53.423
Two way too long,
boring animal acts,

48:53.497 --> 48:55.829
or one fantastic animal act

48:55.899 --> 48:58.800
with the Stupendous Stacie
and Charming Chelsea?

48:59.503 --> 49:01.164
What? I think one act is better,

49:01.238 --> 49:02.296
but Stacie won't
let me do it

49:02.372 --> 49:04.135
and I need to tell her how
important it is because I...

49:04.207 --> 49:05.231
Not now, Chelsea.

49:05.342 --> 49:06.969
But you need to tell her
or it'll get too late

49:07.044 --> 49:08.136
and we won't be
able to plan...

49:08.211 --> 49:09.269
Not now.

49:09.346 --> 49:11.211
Seriously, just stop.

49:14.151 --> 49:16.619
See? Now Skipper's
mad at you, too.

49:17.654 --> 49:19.019
You're in everybody's way.

49:24.328 --> 49:26.956
You don't have to be
a baby about it.

49:29.666 --> 49:31.896
Skipper? Do you
have a minute?

49:32.135 --> 49:34.228
(SIGHING) Sure.

49:36.940 --> 49:39.465
This must look like
kind of a mess to you.

49:39.543 --> 49:42.410
I mean, you do stuff like
this all the time by yourself,

49:42.479 --> 49:44.344
and it's always great.

49:44.481 --> 49:46.847
I'll get it right,
though. I will.

49:47.317 --> 49:50.480
Skipper, I never do
anything like this by myself.

49:51.254 --> 49:53.222
Oh, you do.
I've seen you.

49:53.290 --> 49:56.521
You've put on plays, and starred
in movies, and done block parties.

49:56.593 --> 49:59.084
And what about that fashion show
you did in Paris for Aunt Millie?

49:59.529 --> 50:02.362
I didn't do any of
those things by myself.

50:02.432 --> 50:04.229
Tons of people helped me.

50:05.435 --> 50:06.527
Really?

50:06.603 --> 50:08.833
I couldn't have done it
without them.

50:09.172 --> 50:10.833
I never knew that.

50:11.041 --> 50:13.532
From the outside, it looks
like you can do anything.

50:14.611 --> 50:17.580
It's kind of hard to
measure up to sometimes.

50:17.647 --> 50:19.137
Measure up to?

50:19.349 --> 50:22.250
Skipper, I think
you're amazing.

50:22.719 --> 50:24.346
Look at what happened
with Brian.

50:24.421 --> 50:27.254
He was in awe of you
and your website.

50:27.324 --> 50:30.816
And that's something you
put together all on your own.

50:30.894 --> 50:32.919
I guess.
It's true.

50:33.597 --> 50:37.465
You don't have to compare yourself
to me or anyone else at all.

50:37.534 --> 50:40.230
You're incredible
just the way you are.

Great. Now you're
showing me up again,

I thought you and Chelsea
were watching the dogs.

53:45.388 --> 53:48.619
We were. Then Chelsea pouted
off the way she does, and...

53:48.692 --> 53:50.421
Wait... Pouted off?

53:51.361 --> 53:53.022
Pouted off where?

53:55.832 --> 53:59.359
We can fan out from the inn.
She couldn't have gone far.

53:59.669 --> 54:01.762
Wait. Maybe
she could have.

54:02.405 --> 54:05.169
Look. Sleigh tracks.

54:08.845 --> 54:11.143
The Husky puppy?
He's gone, too?

54:11.348 --> 54:13.145
She must have had him
pull her in the sled.

54:13.416 --> 54:14.678
But it's getting dark.

54:15.151 --> 54:17.642

somewhere all by herself.

starting to snow.

knows this area.

one other spot she's really been.

I wanted to see the reindeer.
And they were all here.

They played with me and Rudy.
And it was so cute.

wander off like that again.

Okay, I promise.

Stacie said I was in everyone's
way, and you were mad at me.

56:38.895 --> 56:41.295
So I thought you'd be
happier if I left you alone.

56:41.364 --> 56:43.332
Oh, Chelsea,
that's not true.

having you around.

you around, I love having you around.

probably better than two.

way better with Charming Chelsea.

57:11.761 --> 57:13.160

57:13.229 --> 57:16.426
She would mean it, if there
was going to be a show.

start in an hour,

57:17.867 --> 57:19.835

have a stage.

There's no way we could
be ready in time.

I'm so sorry, Skipper. It was
your big Christmas Eve show,

57:25.175 --> 57:27.769
with a great new band
playing your song, and...

57:27.844 --> 57:31.041
You must feel like your
whole Christmas is ruined.

make it even perfecter.

with the reindeer.

there a minute ago.
