[John B] <i>There are only three kinds</i>
<i>of relationships in the animal kingdom.</i>

00:13.930 --> 00:15.765
<i>The first is commensalism.</i>

00:16.266 --> 00:19.185
<i>One example...</i>
<i>fish finding hiding spots in coral reefs.</i>

00:19.269 --> 00:21.896
<i>Fish profit,</i>

00:24.232 --> 00:25.358

00:25.442 --> 00:28.028
-[John B] <i>Then, there's mutualism...</i>
-What happened?

00:28.194 --> 00:30.530
<i>...a relationship where both animals</i>
<i>benefit from each other.</i>

00:31.948 --> 00:34.451

00:34.534 --> 00:36.536

[Sarah] <i>This is your room.</i>

01:01.394 --> 01:02.228
Whoa.

01:03.813 --> 01:05.190
It's not too shabby, huh?

01:05.815 --> 01:07.525
Yeah. Not too shabby at all.

01:08.193 --> 01:10.528
And my room is just upstairs,

01:10.612 --> 01:11.946
in case you were wondering.

01:12.030 --> 01:14.157
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. No, I'm good. I'm good. I got it.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.784
-[groans]
-[Sarah chuckles]

01:15.992 --> 01:17.744
-But I have to warn you...
-Uh-oh.

01:17.827 --> 01:18.661
...I sleepwalk.

01:19.746 --> 01:22.791
-[John B sighs]
-[chuckles] So if I show up in your room

01:22.874 --> 01:25.335
-in the middle of the night--
-You just want me to roll with it?

01:26.002 --> 01:26.836
Yeah, maybe.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.256
[Ward] Sarah Elizabeth Cameron!

01:31.216 --> 01:33.760
You've already broken the first rule.
What is the first rule?

01:33.843 --> 01:35.178
Stay out of each other's rooms.

01:35.261 --> 01:37.722
All right, seriously.
Picture that as a boundary.

01:37.806 --> 01:39.808
This is like a minefield.

01:39.891 --> 01:41.142
-Yes, sir?
-Yes, sir.

01:41.226 --> 01:43.353
-[Ward] Yes, sir, John B?
-Uh, yes, sir. Yeah.

01:43.436 --> 01:44.354
All right.

01:44.813 --> 01:47.607
Sarah, can you give me and the new inmate
a quick minute here?

01:48.817 --> 01:49.734
Please be nice.

01:49.818 --> 01:50.693
I'll be nice.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.113
How you doin'? How's the arm?

01:53.613 --> 01:55.073
-Uh, better.
-[Ward] You're lucky.

01:55.156 --> 01:56.825
Fall any other way,
you don't hit that sand,

01:56.908 --> 01:58.868
you could've broken both your legs
and your back.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.328
[John B] Yeah, I'm super lucky.

02:00.411 --> 02:03.289
I just wanna say thank you
for sticking up to DCS for me.

02:03.373 --> 02:06.793
Don't even think about it.
Happy to do it. One other thing. Um...

02:08.753 --> 02:10.338
Last night, Sarah was in my office,

02:10.421 --> 02:14.008
and she was getting a map,
and she said it was for you, and...

02:15.802 --> 02:17.512
I'm sorry, but I just have to ask.

02:17.595 --> 02:21.224
You're not chasin' after pots of gold
like your old man, are you, John B?

02:27.814 --> 02:32.402
Look, Mr. C, uh... Sarah just told me
you guys had some cool old maps.

02:32.485 --> 02:33.570
Mm-hm.

02:34.154 --> 02:37.699
I'm kind of a history buff myself,
and, uh... [chuckles]

02:37.782 --> 02:39.951
...that, I guess, I got from my dad, so...

02:44.539 --> 02:45.540
That makes sense.

02:47.792 --> 02:51.296
Anyway, uh... take it easy
the next couple days, all right?

02:51.379 --> 02:53.298
-[John B] Absolutely.
-You've been through a lot.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.656
I'm sorry. You're staying where?

03:19.115 --> 03:19.991
Tannyhill.

03:20.658 --> 03:22.577
So you're living with Sarah Cameron.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.622
Okay, look, the only reason
I'm living there

03:25.705 --> 03:27.874
is because her dad bailed me out, right?

03:27.957 --> 03:30.418
And it's way better than foster care,
which, by the way,

03:30.501 --> 03:32.420
is where I was about to go
if Ward didn't--

03:32.503 --> 03:34.547
Hey, so do you have a membership
to the clubs now?

03:34.631 --> 03:35.798
I don't know, Pope.

03:36.507 --> 03:39.093
What about those golf carts
they drive around? You get one of them?

03:39.177 --> 03:42.180
Does it come with a sweater-vest,
or do you have to buy one on your own?

03:42.263 --> 03:43.473
Look, you promised.

03:43.556 --> 03:45.058
You said you weren't with her.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.227
Bro, just own it. She got you.

03:48.019 --> 03:50.480
Look, if you wanna hang out with her,
that's fine.

03:50.813 --> 03:53.608
But I'm letting you know now
that I'm not doing anything with Sarah.

03:53.691 --> 03:55.151
Do you guys see her here?

03:55.235 --> 03:58.154
No, right. Okay.
A little focus would be fantastic.

03:58.905 --> 03:59.948
We've got the map, right?

04:00.031 --> 04:02.408
It's out of whack 'cause the guy
was ganja'd when he drew it.

04:02.825 --> 04:04.369
It's 'cause the coast has changed.

04:04.452 --> 04:06.996
[Pope] So we just have to look
for landmarks that haven't changed.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.249
What about the old forts?

04:09.916 --> 04:10.959
Battery Jasper.

04:16.047 --> 04:17.548
We're in Battery, right here.

04:18.383 --> 04:22.720
So if this is parcel nine,
then it's somewhere northeast of here.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.305
-[Kie] Somehwere there.
-[Pope] Right.

04:24.389 --> 04:27.267
Over there? Guy's, that's not Tannyhill,
that's a subdivision.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.018
Tannyhill Plantation
was the entire island.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.229
It got sold into smaller pieces over time.

04:32.772 --> 04:35.275
[Pope] So we're just looking
for an old stone wall.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.819
-Okay, so the road should split up here.
-[John B] Okay.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.612
All right. You're gonna take a left.

04:43.032 --> 04:44.826
[JJ] That looks like a stone wall to me.

04:45.827 --> 04:46.744
This is it.

04:47.245 --> 04:49.706
-[car doors open]
-[John B] Not the Crain house.

04:51.749 --> 04:53.876
-Are you kidding me?
-[car doors close]

04:53.960 --> 04:55.044
Worst-case scenario.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.421
Why'd it have to be here...

04:57.213 --> 04:58.256
of all places?

04:58.339 --> 05:01.759
I heard that Mrs. Crain
buried her husband's head on the property.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.430
[Peterkin] <i>Domestic disturbance,</i>

05:06.556 --> 05:08.057
potential home invasion.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.267
Reports had it wrong.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.811
Nobody invaded anybody.

05:11.894 --> 05:13.313
[Peterkin] Two men were here, Lana.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.231
The only questions I have
is why were they here,

05:15.315 --> 05:16.733
and why are you protecting them?

05:18.609 --> 05:21.154
You mean to tell me
you ripped the front door off its hinges?

05:21.237 --> 05:23.531
[Lana] I was upset.
I had to break something.

05:23.614 --> 05:26.451
-Grief does powerful things.
-[Peterkin] Not that powerful.

05:28.036 --> 05:31.122
I got the GPS coordinates
off Scooter's Grady-White.

05:31.664 --> 05:34.208
I mapped out the route
he took that last day. You mind?

05:35.126 --> 05:37.420
Wanna know where he went? It's curious.

05:37.795 --> 05:40.465
On the day of the hurricane,
when he should've been here with you,

05:40.548 --> 05:42.675
he was riskin' his life,
goin' to an uninhabited island

05:42.759 --> 05:44.177
30 miles offshore.

05:45.261 --> 05:46.471
Now, Scooter...

05:47.347 --> 05:49.182
he wasn't a stupid man.

05:49.265 --> 05:52.226
Why he out in open water
on the day of the storm?

05:56.522 --> 05:57.940
If you're afraid of somebody,

05:58.816 --> 06:00.443
-I can protect you.
-[sighs]

06:00.526 --> 06:02.236
I told you, I don't know anything.

06:05.823 --> 06:07.867
[motorbike engine running]

06:07.950 --> 06:11.204
[sniffs, sighs]

06:11.287 --> 06:13.206
[Barry, loudly] You gonna give me a bump,
big boy?

06:13.581 --> 06:15.583
Man, check out this place, though, huh?

06:15.666 --> 06:17.627
-[Rafe] Hey, Barry. Barry. Hey, man.
-It's fancy!

06:18.211 --> 06:19.921
It's a nice place to live!

06:20.004 --> 06:22.131
-[quietly] I don't have your money.
-[Barry] Mm-hm.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.717
All right? Uh-- you shouldn't be here now.
What are you doing?

06:24.801 --> 06:27.595
-I'm right here. You wanna know why?
-Give me till the weekend, okay?

06:27.678 --> 06:29.680
All I-- all I need you to do
is front me more coke.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.808
-Mm-hm. Yeah.
-[Rafe] I got a guy coming this weekend.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.768
-It's cool, right?
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

06:33.851 --> 06:35.937
How come you got
all this nice shit, though?

06:36.020 --> 06:37.438
-Can you tell me that?
-[sniffs]

06:37.522 --> 06:40.274
You ain't got my money,
but you got all this nice shit.

06:40.358 --> 06:41.526
-Man, yeah, just...
-Hm? Hm?

06:41.609 --> 06:43.736
-Hey, chill, chill! All right-- Hey!
-Come here!

-Hey! Get off! What're you doing? Hey!
-[grunting]

06:46.406 --> 06:48.491
-[skin sizzling]
-[Barry] Put that on there. Yeah!

06:48.574 --> 06:50.701
-Hey! Shit! Stop, stop, stop, stop!
-That's it!

06:50.785 --> 06:53.496
-That's it, you little bitch!
-Okay, stop, stop! Okay, chill, man.

06:53.579 --> 06:55.957
-[groaning]
-[Barry] How's that feel, baby boy?

06:56.541 --> 06:58.835
That's just the coming attractions,

07:00.753 --> 07:03.214

07:22.108 --> 07:24.193
[Kie] Look, you guys know
whose house this is, right?

07:24.277 --> 07:25.236
[JJ] Oh, yeah. No, I do.

07:25.319 --> 07:27.572
Honestly, I don't really believe
the stories of this place.

07:27.655 --> 07:29.031
-[Pope] Shh.
-What?

07:30.450 --> 07:31.826
Which stories did you hear?

07:32.326 --> 07:35.037
The one where she killed her husband
with an axe

07:35.121 --> 07:37.123
and that she's been holed up ever since.

07:37.665 --> 07:39.667
On certain nights,
when the moon is full...

07:40.376 --> 07:41.544
you can see her in the window!

07:41.627 --> 07:43.963
-No, it's not funny, 'cause it's all true.
-Waah!

07:44.046 --> 07:47.425
I swear to God, guys, this is all real.
I knew Hollis. Jeez!

07:47.508 --> 07:49.635
-Wait, you knew Hollis Crain?
-Yeah, dude.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.637
Dude, how do you know Hollis Crain?

07:51.721 --> 07:54.599
She was my babysitter, man.
She told me all about it.

07:54.682 --> 07:57.310
Told me the truth... about her mother

07:57.768 --> 07:59.353
and what happened in this house.

08:00.313 --> 08:04.108
So as a kid, she heard all the stories
that her mother killed her father,<i> </i>and...

08:04.192 --> 08:05.776
she was a murderer and all.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.153
Hollis didn't believe it.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.239
-Until that night.
-What night?

08:11.657 --> 08:12.867
It all came back to her.

08:16.287 --> 08:19.999
When Hollis was six years old,
she heard her parents arguing downstairs.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.961
So she goes downstairs to see her mom
washing her hands in a sink...

08:24.962 --> 08:26.923
full of blood.

08:28.674 --> 08:30.760
Her mother just says
that she cut her finger.

08:31.677 --> 08:33.971
The next morning,
she says her father and her split up.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.390
But then, Hollis noticed something.

08:36.891 --> 08:39.519
Her mother going
into the parlor constantly,

08:40.019 --> 08:43.105
in and out and in and out
with plastic bags.

08:43.189 --> 08:45.942
Weeks pass,
and Hollis decides to use the outhouse.

08:46.025 --> 08:48.653
And as she's using it, she looks down,

08:48.736 --> 08:51.030
and there, in the outhouse,

08:51.739 --> 08:55.368
is her father's head,
looking straight back at her.

08:55.451 --> 08:57.078
God, you are so full of shit.

08:57.161 --> 08:58.496
Dude, I swear to God, man.

08:58.579 --> 09:00.581
-Did she call the police?
-She didn't have time.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.333
-[Pope] We can't do this--
-Wait! Dude!

09:02.416 --> 09:03.417
What?

09:05.336 --> 09:08.297
You sure you wanna do this?
She's an axe murderer. You got a cast on.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.967
I don't give a shit
if she's an axe murderer, okay?

09:11.551 --> 09:14.929
I got nothin' to lose, right?
You comin' or what?

09:16.389 --> 09:17.390
[Kie] Come on.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.646
[whispers] Hey, come on. Come here.

09:24.397 --> 09:27.358
So here's the plan. We need to look
for the wheat near the water

09:27.441 --> 09:28.943
like it said in Denmark's letter.

09:29.443 --> 09:32.446
Okay, like, what kind of water?
Like, pond water?

09:32.530 --> 09:33.739
[chuckles] Bong water?

09:33.823 --> 09:36.534
No. It--
it just said look for water, okay?

09:37.368 --> 09:39.245
That's the shittiest secret message ever.

09:41.205 --> 09:44.500
You wanna complain a little more, Kie?
Nobody said it was gonna be easy.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.919
I'll search the northeast quadrant,
you search the northwest.

09:47.336 --> 09:48.963

-[Kie] Know why we didn't find it?

11:19.136 --> 11:20.096
Bad karma.

11:20.179 --> 11:21.389
Oh, God. Here we go.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.307
You know, we had a good thing going.

11:23.724 --> 11:27.186
And then you decide to rope in Barbie,
and now the trail's gone dry.

11:27.269 --> 11:28.437
Coincidence? Probably not.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.856
This is exactly why
I didn't wanna tell you about Sarah.

11:30.940 --> 11:31.857
-[Kie] Yeah?
-Yeah.

11:31.941 --> 11:34.276
-What the hell's the deal with you two?
-Nothing.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.113
Nothing? Is it because I kissed you?
Is that the problem?

11:37.196 --> 11:38.614
-[Pope] Oh!
-[JJ] Oh, shit!

11:38.698 --> 11:40.282
-That echoed, dude!
-Stop treating me

11:40.366 --> 11:42.827
like I'm some girl
that's obsessed with you

11:42.910 --> 11:45.621
instead of your best friend
who's actually trying to look out for you.

11:45.705 --> 11:46.997
Did you, uh... hit me?

11:47.081 --> 11:49.125
-Skeeter.
-[John B] Skeeter?

11:49.208 --> 11:50.710
-Yeah, you see it?
-[John B] Yeah.

11:50.793 --> 11:51.919
-[JJ] Oh, hey!
-[Pope] Okay...

11:52.002 --> 11:53.170
-[JJ] No--
-Where's your proof?

11:54.588 --> 11:55.423
Skeeter.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.843
-Yeah? There was probably one right there.
-There's one right there.

11:58.926 --> 12:00.428
-[Kie] Really? You saw that?
-[Pope] Sh!

12:00.511 --> 12:02.138
-On your forehead.
-You're dead. That's it.

12:02.221 --> 12:03.973
Today's the day that you die.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.599
-[Pope] Jesus.
-Today's your funeral.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.184
-[mosquito buzzes]
-[Kie] One bandito.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.395
-These things are a freakin' swarm!
-[Kie] You see this?

12:09.478 --> 12:10.646
[JJ] Hey, sh! Keep it down!

12:10.730 --> 12:12.690
-[Kie chuckles]
-[John B] You know how this ends.

12:12.773 --> 12:14.650
Why are there so many mosquitoes
in a basement?

12:14.734 --> 12:18.154
[JJ] Dude. I know, seriously.
Tiny vampire bats, just leave me alone.

12:20.406 --> 12:23.951
Oh, my gosh! Okay, can we leave?
'Cause I'm already itchin' to leave.

12:24.034 --> 12:25.286
Hah? Punny.

12:27.079 --> 12:29.623
[John B groans] All right... Ow!

12:29.707 --> 12:31.751
I just found
Mrs. Crain's voodoo doll, guys.

12:32.251 --> 12:33.794
[Kie giggling] Oh, shit.

12:35.087 --> 12:37.339
[JJ] All right, can we leave this?
'Cause this is getting--

12:37.423 --> 12:38.924
[water splashes, echoes]

12:39.008 --> 12:40.676
[Kie] Skeeter, for real.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.554
-Hey, guys.
-[JJ] Hey, Pope!

12:43.637 --> 12:44.638
-[John B] Oh!
-[Kie] Sh!

12:44.722 --> 12:46.390
-Hey. Help me move this.
-Sh! Um...

12:46.474 --> 12:48.476
-[whispers] Help me move this.
-Okay, just... quiet.

12:49.310 --> 12:50.394
-[JJ] All right.
-[Pope] Hey.

12:51.687 --> 12:52.563
[John B] Sh!

12:53.898 --> 12:56.317
-[Kie] Guys! Guys!
-[Pope] Guys. I know. Yeah. Yeah. Sh, sh.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.985
[Kie] She's probably right upstairs.

13:10.915 --> 13:12.374
[Pope] Well, well, well.

13:12.458 --> 13:13.709
That was a good dad joke.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.009
They built this part of the house
right over it.

13:22.092 --> 13:24.512
-This is where she hid the bodies.
-Oh, dude, come on.

13:24.595 --> 13:25.888
-Stop.
-No, I'm dead serious.

13:25.971 --> 13:26.806
-Stop it!
-Hey, hey.

13:26.889 --> 13:29.642
-It was never an outhouse.
-She probably doesn't even know it's here.

13:30.100 --> 13:30.976
So...

13:32.686 --> 13:33.687
we found water.

13:33.771 --> 13:35.523
We're gonna need a really big rope.

13:43.072 --> 13:44.281
[door closes]

13:45.282 --> 13:46.116
[Topper] Hey.

13:49.370 --> 13:51.539
Hey, how's John B?
Is he-- is he doin' all right?

13:52.957 --> 13:55.543
-Like you give a shit.
-[Topper] You realize I did not push him.

13:55.626 --> 13:57.545
-He lost his balance and fell.
-[Sarah] Don't lie.

13:57.628 --> 14:00.798
-He fell against the rail. Not my fault.
-[Sarah] That is messed up.

14:00.881 --> 14:02.424
[scoffs]

14:03.509 --> 14:05.511
[Topper] You forget about us, like--

14:05.594 --> 14:07.888
Midsummers was supposed to be
our-- our coming-out party.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.890
That was supposed to be
something special, right?

14:09.974 --> 14:12.184
What does it matter, Topper?
We're in high school.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.811
It's not like we're getting married.

14:13.894 --> 14:15.980
I don't care if we're in high school!
I love you!

14:16.063 --> 14:18.315
-[Sarah] No, you don't, Topper!
-I love you!

14:18.899 --> 14:20.442
You love the idea of me.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.361
-You love being seen with me...
-[Topper] Stop.

14:22.444 --> 14:23.779
...but you don't love me.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.532
You have no idea what I'm feeling.
You have no clue.

14:27.741 --> 14:29.952
What about-- what about this summer?
Right?

14:30.035 --> 14:31.662
This summer was supposed to be legendary.

14:31.745 --> 14:33.455
I don't care anymore, Topper.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.541
I can't be with you.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.543
Not after last night.

14:38.168 --> 14:40.045
-[Topper] Oh, after last night?
-[Sarah] Yeah.

14:40.129 --> 14:41.881
-You-- you wanna talk about last night?
-Sure.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.925
Did you forget the part
where you cheated on me? Huh?

14:45.009 --> 14:46.719
Did you forget about that?

14:46.802 --> 14:49.597
You're a slut! You know that?
You're a slut!

14:49.680 --> 14:51.599
Watch your mouth
when you talk about my daughter!

14:51.682 --> 14:53.517
Your daughter's banging a Pogue--

14:53.601 --> 14:55.019
[choking]

14:57.438 --> 14:59.940
-Dad.
-You need to go home, Topper.

15:00.024 --> 15:00.983
[Sarah] Dad, stop!

15:01.942 --> 15:03.569
Dad, let go of him, please.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.531
[Ward breathing heavily]

15:08.949 --> 15:10.576
-[car door slams]
-[sighs]

15:10.659 --> 15:12.161
-[engine starts]
-[door closes]

15:14.830 --> 15:16.332
-[sobs]
-Come on. Come on.

15:17.833 --> 15:18.709
Come on.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.421
[Shoupe] What the hell was Scooter Grubbs
doin' out this far?

15:22.922 --> 15:25.174
Hell of a place to come
on the day of a hurricane.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.009
Yes, it is.

15:27.801 --> 15:29.553
It's just a spit of land.

15:38.687 --> 15:40.356
The shoals ain't that big.

15:40.439 --> 15:42.524
You take this side, I'll take the other.

15:43.192 --> 15:45.486
What is it
I'm supposed to be looking for, anyway?

15:46.445 --> 15:47.529
Anything that might tell us

15:47.613 --> 15:50.282
what Scooter Grubbs was doin' here
the night he died.

15:55.162 --> 15:57.206
-[Sarah] So you found the gold?
-[John B] Yes.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.041
[Sarah] But under an axe murderer's house?

15:59.124 --> 16:00.876
[John B] Well, yeah, uh-- kind of.

16:01.418 --> 16:03.045
-[Sarah] That's perfect.
-[John B] Yes.

16:03.128 --> 16:05.381
I mean, the only thing
is the well is super sketchy deep.

16:05.464 --> 16:08.384
-[Sarah] Kinda wish I was with you guys.
-You'll be there for real tonight.

16:09.843 --> 16:11.887
-Is it okay?
-Yeah, of course.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.306
What?
Vlad and Val gotta be together, right?

16:14.390 --> 16:16.558
No, no. I mean... with the others.

16:16.642 --> 16:17.893
Yes, everything's fine.

16:18.602 --> 16:20.521
-What?
-[sighs]

16:21.981 --> 16:24.733
-Kiara said something, didn't she?
-No.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.819
-You're the worst liar I've ever met.
-I'm not lying.

16:26.902 --> 16:31.156
-Look, if she's gonna get territorial--
-Hey, hey, hey, just listen. All right?

16:31.991 --> 16:34.743
You're a part of this too.
You got us the Tannyhill map.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.788
Once we get with everybody,
they're gonna be excited.

16:40.040 --> 16:40.958
I promise.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.169
No effing way!

16:44.253 --> 16:46.797
You brought her here?
So what? She's in on this now?

16:48.549 --> 16:49.425
I dunno.

16:49.508 --> 16:53.345
Look, all I care about
is her cut comes out of your share.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.514
You know, I don't remember taking a vote.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.057
This is our thing.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.434
A Pogue thing.

16:58.851 --> 17:02.396
I gotta say, I'm just a tad uncomfortable
with all of this.

17:02.479 --> 17:03.856
-[Kie] Thank you!
-When are you not?

17:03.939 --> 17:06.942
I dunno. I rode here on the back
of JJ's bike pretty comfortably.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.861
It's true.
Most relaxed I've ever seen him.

17:09.945 --> 17:10.863
That's cute, guys.

17:10.946 --> 17:13.574
You know we were all extremely comfortable
until you brought her.

17:13.657 --> 17:15.951
-Stop talking about me like I'm not here!
-Then leave.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.579
[scoffs] I told you.

17:19.413 --> 17:21.206
Told him what, exactly?

17:21.749 --> 17:24.293
-That you're a liar?
-No, that you're a shit-talking bitch.

17:24.376 --> 17:25.961
-Oh, shit!
-[Sarah] When have I lied?

17:26.045 --> 17:28.047
-My money's on Kie.
-You get somebody close to you--

17:28.130 --> 17:30.674
-I didn't lie about shit--
-Everybody shut up!

17:33.385 --> 17:36.055
Kie, you are my best friend, right?

17:37.973 --> 17:39.308
And Sarah, you're... [chuckles]

17:40.309 --> 17:41.226
...you're my...

17:43.270 --> 17:44.104
Say it.

17:45.981 --> 17:46.940
You're my girlfriend.

17:47.524 --> 17:49.359
Ohh... that's new.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.195
[Kie] She's your girlfriend now?

17:52.571 --> 17:56.075
What was all that talk about
you were just using her for information?

17:56.158 --> 17:58.035
Get a map, cut her loose.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.038
You said you were using me?

18:03.165 --> 18:04.625
-No.
-Yeah, you did.

18:04.708 --> 18:07.336
-You said those things.
-Look, love just walked in, okay?

18:07.419 --> 18:08.962
-Oh, vomit.
-[John B] I didn't expect it.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.547
It just-- it kind of happened.

18:12.549 --> 18:14.009
And I'm not gonna deny it.

18:14.384 --> 18:16.762
-Right?
-[Pope whispers] Oh! That's corny.

18:16.845 --> 18:17.679
[retches]

18:19.473 --> 18:21.391
Look, cut the bullshit, John B.

18:22.309 --> 18:23.393
If she's in, I'm out.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.814
-I'm not doing this. I can't!
-[Kie] You <i>are </i>gonna decide.

18:26.897 --> 18:29.191
I'm very interested, actually. Me or her?

18:29.274 --> 18:30.400
Both.

18:30.484 --> 18:32.820
-[Pope] Ooh.
-[JJ whistles] Went for the Hail Mary.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.029
[Pope] Noooo!

18:35.197 --> 18:36.698
[both tutting]

18:36.782 --> 18:37.866
[door slams]

18:38.450 --> 18:39.576
[footsteps fading]

18:39.660 --> 18:40.786
It'll be cool, right?

18:44.081 --> 18:45.207
I'm gonna leave.

18:45.290 --> 18:49.378
-[John B] Sarah, don't.
-Gonna let y'all chat. Let me know.

18:52.005 --> 18:54.591
I'd just like to say,
you handled that beautifully.

19:03.392 --> 19:04.309
Dad?

19:17.030 --> 19:19.449
[whispers]
Four, three, three, zero, zero. Okay.

19:25.122 --> 19:25.956
[safe beeping]

19:26.039 --> 19:27.374
[Rafe] Four, three... okay...

19:27.457 --> 19:28.709
[safe beeps rapidly]

19:28.792 --> 19:30.043
Shit! Come on.

19:31.295 --> 19:33.839
-[safe beeping]
-Four, three, three...

19:33.922 --> 19:35.299
-[lock clicks]
-Okay! Yeah.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.679
Okay, okay. Okay.

19:40.762 --> 19:42.848
<i>-</i>[safe door closes]
-[breathing heavily]

19:48.979 --> 19:49.813
[sniffs]

19:51.523 --> 19:52.524
Checking the time?

19:53.650 --> 19:54.985
[clears throat] Uh...

19:59.406 --> 20:01.158
[Pope] Corpses cry too, you know.

20:01.950 --> 20:05.037
Well, they secrete fluid from their eyes.

20:05.120 --> 20:08.040
Maybe not compare my feelings
to secretions?

20:08.123 --> 20:09.541
Technically, it's discharge.

20:11.585 --> 20:12.794
I'll stop talking now.

20:21.803 --> 20:22.721
What're you doing?

20:27.100 --> 20:28.018
Just...

20:28.602 --> 20:30.062
-Uh... I don't know.
-[sniffles]

20:30.145 --> 20:33.690
Just be your usual weird self, okay?

20:34.983 --> 20:36.610
I hate John B right now.

20:38.028 --> 20:41.073
Look, it's just because
I know how this ends.

20:41.156 --> 20:42.741
I've seen this movie.

20:42.824 --> 20:43.909
I starred in it.

20:43.992 --> 20:47.162
I mean, freshman year,
it was my first year at the Kook Academy.

20:47.704 --> 20:49.414
You know how intimidating that is?

20:51.333 --> 20:54.294
And one of these things
is obviously not like the other.

20:54.378 --> 20:57.089
I mean, I didn't have anything
in common with anyone,

20:57.881 --> 20:59.967
and just as I'm about to slit my wrists,

21:00.050 --> 21:04.638
the queen asks me
if I wanna go save baby sea turtles.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.645
Our first day together,
we walked to the beach.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.732
We waited for the hatch,
and we kept the seagulls off

21:15.816 --> 21:17.985
so that the turtles
could get to the water.

21:18.068 --> 21:21.446
That... actually sounds kinda nice.

21:23.407 --> 21:24.992
It was the best day of my life.

21:27.661 --> 21:31.123
And then she turned on me
like she does with everyone.

21:32.666 --> 21:34.376
Look, I'm not doing this with her.

21:35.669 --> 21:37.129
He's gonna have to choose.

21:37.212 --> 21:38.547
You know he can't do that.

21:38.964 --> 21:39.840
Why not?

21:41.717 --> 21:42.884
Because he's an idiot.

21:54.771 --> 21:57.232
If it were me... I know who I'd choose.

22:03.363 --> 22:04.364
What'd she say?

22:05.198 --> 22:06.283
That you're an idiot.

22:07.951 --> 22:10.287
-It's a no-brainer. You're picking Kie.
-Mm-mm.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.497
Look, I can't make a decision.

22:12.581 --> 22:15.292
So what? We're just dead in the water
because you're pussy-whipped?

22:15.375 --> 22:17.294
We can't do this without Kie,
and you know it.

22:17.377 --> 22:19.087
And I can't do it without Sarah.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.048
Okay? They both have to be in on it.

22:21.131 --> 22:22.466
Well, good luck with that.

22:23.216 --> 22:25.719

I know this was my fault, all right?

22:25.802 --> 22:26.887

Four things.

23:44.548 --> 23:46.883

is that these four things...

'Cause if that's my money right there,
then... wanna put it in my hand?

You won't.

and then you ghosted me,

35:45.309 --> 35:46.769
-[Sarah] Go, boys.
-[Kie] And girls.

35:46.853 --> 35:48.271
-[Pope] Let's go.
-[JJ] Let's roll.

35:48.354 --> 35:49.564
-[Sarah] Right on.
-Wait, wait

35:52.608 --> 35:54.694
I wanna say thank you, guys. Seriously.

35:55.945 --> 35:57.864
It means a lot to me
that you're here tonight.

36:00.324 --> 36:01.200
Always.

36:02.118 --> 36:03.411
[chuckles softly]

36:03.494 --> 36:04.620
Of course, man.

36:05.204 --> 36:06.122
My man.

36:09.083 --> 36:11.586
All right, we done with the circle jerk?
Can we go do this?

36:12.086 --> 36:14.297
-Yeah.
-[Pope] Let's get that wheat in the water.

36:14.380 --> 36:17.216
-[JJ] Weed? I'm up for weed.
-[Pope] Wheat. I said wheat.

36:17.300 --> 36:19.218
-[Kie] After you.
-[Sarah] Ladies first.

36:19.302 --> 36:20.178
[Kie] Alley-oop.

36:41.490 --> 36:43.034
-[Sarah gasps] Shit!
-[John B] Oh, shit!

36:43.117 --> 36:44.410
-Go, go, go, go.
-Flashlights!

36:44.493 --> 36:46.078
-[JJ] It's on strobe!
-[Kie] Flashlights.

36:46.162 --> 36:47.163
-[JJ panting]
-Shh!

36:47.246 --> 36:48.164
Okay...

36:48.789 --> 36:52.126
Okay, so she has motion sensor lights.

36:53.127 --> 36:55.880
We could, uh... move really slowly, maybe?

36:55.963 --> 36:57.340
-What?
-That's not how it works.

36:57.423 --> 37:00.426
-Oh, shit. Let's throw a rock at it.
-[Pope] What?

37:00.509 --> 37:03.304
That's a really good idea.
Let the axe murderer know that we're here.

37:03.387 --> 37:05.598
-Throw a rock at it?
-[John B] You have a better idea?

37:05.681 --> 37:07.183
Literally anything but that.

37:07.266 --> 37:10.019
What about the breaker?
In the circuit box on the porch.

37:10.102 --> 37:12.146
We used to play
hide-and-seek here as kids.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.732
And if we were brave enough,
we'd go all the way up to the porch.

37:15.524 --> 37:16.359
I've seen it.

37:16.442 --> 37:18.778
No, no.
You're not going in the house alone.

37:19.278 --> 37:20.112
Watch me.

37:20.196 --> 37:22.281
Crain chops people into pieces.

37:22.365 --> 37:24.408
If you believe that,
but she's like what, 85?

37:24.492 --> 37:27.161
-[JJ] Yeah, somethin' like that.
-She's probably barely still kicking.

37:27.662 --> 37:28.955
Here. I'll go with you.

37:29.705 --> 37:31.290
-Yeah.
-[Pope] We'll wait for your signal.

37:32.166 --> 37:35.628
-[Sarah] Okay, cool.
-[John B] Hey! Be safe.

37:36.295 --> 37:37.213
[Sarah] We will.

37:39.799 --> 37:41.884
-Be safe.
-I'll be so safe.

37:42.301 --> 37:44.637
-I'll be safe for you.
-[John B] Can you guys stop? Stop!

37:45.763 --> 37:46.806
I'm gonna kill you.

37:47.348 --> 37:49.141
But how would that keep us safe?

37:58.359 --> 38:01.779
[Sarah] She must have a generator
plugged into the main power supply.

38:05.992 --> 38:08.286
-[Kie gasps]
-Shh...

38:20.423 --> 38:21.632
[Sarah] Where are the breakers?

38:21.716 --> 38:22.591
What is this?

38:22.675 --> 38:24.135
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

38:24.468 --> 38:25.594
Shit.

38:27.013 --> 38:28.264
[Sarah] It goes inside.

38:42.611 --> 38:44.363
[door creaking]

38:45.948 --> 38:49.660
-[JJ] They said when Hollis disappeared--
-That you should shut the eff up!

38:51.412 --> 38:52.413
[JJ whistles]

39:03.257 --> 39:05.134
[cat yowling]

39:05.217 --> 39:06.218
[glass tinkling]

39:11.766 --> 39:12.641
[Kie] Hey.

39:13.893 --> 39:14.977
[Sarah] Yeah. Yeah.

39:15.353 --> 39:16.479
Yeah.

39:25.154 --> 39:26.572
-[both chuckle softly]
-[Sarah] Oh.

39:26.655 --> 39:27.907
-All right.
-[Sarah] Okay.

39:27.990 --> 39:29.241
[switch clicks]

39:31.994 --> 39:33.996
-[switch clicks]
-[generator powers down]

39:36.874 --> 39:38.417
They did it. Go time.

39:38.501 --> 39:39.460
[Pope] So, let's do it.

39:39.543 --> 39:41.128
[John B] Three, two...

39:42.296 --> 39:43.631
Just-- just-- just go.

39:57.853 --> 39:59.772
[JJ] Holy crap, you know what this is?

39:59.855 --> 40:00.981
It just hit me.

40:01.065 --> 40:02.066
Pope, look.

40:02.983 --> 40:04.860
This is <i>C.H.U.D.</i> Full <i>C.H.U.D.</i>

40:05.319 --> 40:06.320
What is he talking about?

40:06.404 --> 40:08.697
Cannibalistic humanoid
underground dwellers?

40:09.156 --> 40:10.449
Have you guys not seen that film?

40:10.533 --> 40:11.951
-[John B] No.
-Can't say I have, no.

40:12.034 --> 40:13.035
It's actually a good film.

40:13.119 --> 40:14.954
It's about cannibals
that live in the sewers

40:15.037 --> 40:16.789
and under New York City, and it's like--

40:16.872 --> 40:18.207
[John B] Shut up! Shut up!

40:19.375 --> 40:21.460
All right.
How deep do you think this is, Pope?

40:21.919 --> 40:22.920
[sighs] I don't know.

40:25.423 --> 40:26.757
[whirring]

40:26.841 --> 40:28.008
[Sarah gasps]

40:29.593 --> 40:30.428
Shit.

40:36.767 --> 40:38.394
Hey, boys. I have one request.

40:38.477 --> 40:39.562
-[JJ] Yeah?
-Yeah?

40:39.645 --> 40:40.938
Don't drop me.

40:41.063 --> 40:42.773
-[JJ] Whoa!
-[yells] Okay...

40:42.857 --> 40:45.192
-You're gonna die first, for sure.
-Got ya.

40:45.276 --> 40:47.778
All right, just keep payin' it out
nice and slow like that.

40:50.990 --> 40:52.575
Here we go. Keep goin'.

40:55.661 --> 40:57.329
[grunting]

41:00.958 --> 41:02.001
Keep goin'.

41:05.087 --> 41:07.006
Wait, hold on one second.
I'm gonna get situated.

41:07.089 --> 41:07.965
[Pope] You good?

41:08.424 --> 41:09.467

41:20.352 --> 41:21.854
-[clank]
-[gasps]

41:26.609 --> 41:29.236
-You good, man?
-[John B] What the hell was that?

41:29.320 --> 41:30.696
Little technical difficulties.

41:31.822 --> 41:33.115
Keep going, slow!

41:33.199 --> 41:35.326
Okay, we're gonna start
paying you out again, all right?

41:36.911 --> 41:38.621
[breathing heavily]

41:39.455 --> 41:40.956
[wind whistling]

41:45.377 --> 41:47.213
[Mrs. Crain wheezing, coughs]

41:51.884 --> 41:53.886
[shuffling and thumping]

41:56.096 --> 41:57.431
[breathing heavily]

42:00.601 --> 42:01.602
Shit.

42:01.685 --> 42:03.812

42:05.147 --> 42:06.649

42:08.400 --> 42:11.403
Okay. Okay. All right, keep goin'.

42:11.487 --> 42:13.531
[grunts] All right. Keep it comin'.

42:14.031 --> 42:15.991
[exhales, grunts] Okay.

42:16.075 --> 42:17.076
[Pope groans]

42:17.159 --> 42:19.787
Hey. Hey, we got 15 feet left.

42:19.870 --> 42:22.873
-Are you getting close to the bottom?
-[John B] I can't tell.

42:23.207 --> 42:25.000
-Just-- just keep goin'.
-Give me more.

42:25.084 --> 42:26.168
Yeah...

42:32.716 --> 42:34.093
Whoa! Stop!

42:35.886 --> 42:39.014
I'm hangin' over

42:39.098 --> 42:40.516
[Pope] You want back up?

42:40.599 --> 42:42.142
Keep goin', I guess...

42:42.601 --> 42:43.561
[JJ] Nice and slow.

Oh.

42:55.990 --> 42:59.034
[breathing shakily]

43:01.662 --> 43:03.706
Okay, okay! I'm at bottom.

43:04.915 --> 43:05.916
How is it down there?

43:07.001 --> 43:08.335
It's worse than I thought.

43:09.336 --> 43:12.172
-[thumping]
-[Mrs. Crain] It's-- it's late, Leon.

43:13.966 --> 43:16.719
Too late. [coughing]

43:16.802 --> 43:19.888
-You find any gold?
-[John B] Uh, nothin' yet.

43:21.849 --> 43:22.808
Wait.

43:23.892 --> 43:25.936
I think I felt something with my foot.

43:29.148 --> 43:31.150
[exhales] Here goes nothin'.

43:31.483 --> 43:32.735
