WEBVTT

00:06.873 --> 00:08.041
(pleasant music playing)

00:08.141 --> 00:10.877
Captain Stede:
Just out there,
there was a whale,

00:10.977 --> 00:12.479
and it was being chased
by a whole bunch of sharks...

00:12.545 --> 00:15.415
Izzy:
<i>We've been almost a fortnight</i>
<i>aboard "The Revenge"...</i>

00:15.515 --> 00:18.518
(laughing)

00:18.585 --> 00:20.387
<i>and I'm startin' to suspect</i>

00:20.487 --> 00:25.425
<i>that Edward has no intention</i>
<i>of ending Stede Bonnet's life.</i>

00:25.525 --> 00:28.061
<i>If I didn't know better...</i>

00:28.161 --> 00:33.333
<i>I'd say he's somehow become</i>
<i>seduced by this... imbecile.</i>

00:35.335 --> 00:36.736
(grunts)

00:36.836 --> 00:39.205
Ha-ha! Shall we
call this a draw?

00:39.272 --> 00:42.008
(chuckles)
Never!

00:42.075 --> 00:44.511
Ah! Ooh! Bugger!

00:46.012 --> 00:48.248
You are improving,
though... Kinda.

00:48.348 --> 00:52.185
Yeah, well, it's been
days since I've cut
myself on my sword.

00:52.252 --> 00:54.254
Oop, no, there we go.
Damn.

00:54.354 --> 00:55.755
You know what, Stede?

00:55.855 --> 00:57.424
If you wanted,
I could teach you

00:57.524 --> 00:59.726
a more advanced
trick of the trade.

01:00.260 --> 01:01.227
Oh yeah?

01:02.195 --> 01:03.229
(sword clatters)

01:06.099 --> 01:07.434
Stab me.

01:07.534 --> 01:09.803
(chuckles)
Yeah, right.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.938
Oh, what's wrong?
You scared?

01:12.038 --> 01:14.774
Take your sword,
run me through.

01:14.874 --> 01:15.608
(scoffs)

01:15.708 --> 01:17.811
I don't think
I wanna do that.

01:17.911 --> 01:17.944
No worries then.

01:19.879 --> 01:21.247
I'll just have
to shoot you.

01:21.314 --> 01:22.949
-Ed, don't shoot me!
-Come on, mate!

01:23.049 --> 01:24.584
This is it.
I'm gonna shoot
you in the face!

01:24.651 --> 01:25.985
-No!
-This is the life.

01:27.153 --> 01:29.089
Now, act... or die.

01:29.155 --> 01:29.889
-No!
-One!

01:29.956 --> 01:31.391
-Two! Three!
-Ahh!

01:31.458 --> 01:33.827
-Come at me, dog!
-Ah! Ahh!

01:33.927 --> 01:35.061
-(blade slices)
-(winces)

01:37.130 --> 01:40.233
-(chuckles)
-Ya happy now, you--

01:40.300 --> 01:42.102
-Yeah.
-I stabbed you, you nut!

01:42.168 --> 01:45.004
You managed to avoid
all the important bits.

01:45.105 --> 01:49.242
-What?
-You see... gettin'
run-through's an art.

01:49.309 --> 01:51.644
I've had it done to me
dozens of times.

01:51.744 --> 01:54.314
The key...
(grunts)

01:54.414 --> 01:56.316
is to take the blade where
it does the least damage.

01:56.416 --> 01:59.652
-(Captain Stede groans)
-Science tells us that
all the useful organs

01:59.752 --> 02:00.954
are on the right
part of the body,

02:01.020 --> 02:02.489
so I cleverly took
the sword on the left.

02:02.589 --> 02:05.425
What-- Is that right?

02:05.492 --> 02:09.195
-I mean, the, the liver.
-The liver? (chuckles)

02:09.295 --> 02:10.830
We don't even know
what that thing does.

02:10.930 --> 02:11.931
Well...

02:13.166 --> 02:16.169
how-how does one...
get it out?

02:16.269 --> 02:19.939
Let me see. Now, relax a little,
and then you just gently tug.

02:20.006 --> 02:22.542
You ready?
And... go.

02:22.642 --> 02:23.977
-(grunting)
-Yep, tug it.

02:24.043 --> 02:25.678
-Oh god!
-Little tug, little tug,
tiny tug.

02:25.778 --> 02:27.313
Little, little tug.
Ah, more!

02:27.380 --> 02:30.483
-(moaning)
-(grunting)

02:30.550 --> 02:31.885
-Blackbeard: Ahh!
-Captain Stede: Ooh!

02:31.985 --> 02:33.887
Blackbeard:
Keep going.
Keep-- Yeah.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.189
-Yeah, yeah, oh yeah.
-My god.

02:36.289 --> 02:37.357
-Blackbeard:
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-(moaning)

02:37.457 --> 02:39.359
-Oh my god.
-(moaning)

02:39.459 --> 02:40.026
Oh my god!

02:40.126 --> 02:44.063
(januty pirate tune playing)

02:44.164 --> 02:49.369
And, finally, the man saw
who was driving the carriage.

02:49.469 --> 02:54.207
It was an elderly gentleman
with a hook... for a head!

02:54.307 --> 02:56.042
A hook for a head?

02:56.142 --> 02:58.044
How does that work?
H-How does he even eat?

02:58.144 --> 03:01.915
He doesn't eat.
He's got a hook
for a head.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.317
-Does it even make sense?
-All: No.

03:04.384 --> 03:06.219
-How does he kiss?
-It doesn't kiss.

03:06.319 --> 03:08.721
-No one likes him.
-It's not scary at all.

03:08.821 --> 03:10.723
I bet Blackbeard
knows a scary story.

03:10.823 --> 03:13.059
(pirates agreeing)

03:13.159 --> 03:16.329
What's the scariest thing
you've ever seen... sir?

03:17.931 --> 03:20.099
That's hard to say
because I don't feel fear.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.701
(impressed murmurs)

03:21.768 --> 03:23.736
But... I think
the scariest thing
I've ever seen

03:23.836 --> 03:25.205
would probably be...

03:27.607 --> 03:28.942
the Kraken.

03:29.042 --> 03:32.345
The, the Kraken's
not real, though.

03:32.412 --> 03:34.847
I remember when
I used to think that.

03:34.914 --> 03:36.916
So, is the plan off?

03:37.016 --> 03:39.252
Yeah, I reckon we're
not killing this guy now.

03:39.352 --> 03:42.455
The plan is
very much alive.

03:42.555 --> 03:46.059
-He promised me.
-It just seems that he's
having an awfully nice time.

03:46.125 --> 03:48.261
I mean, look at him.
He's telling ghost stories.

03:48.361 --> 03:51.431
This is the most
open and available
I've ever seen him.

03:51.531 --> 03:57.103
There I was...
just a young waif
on a late-night walk.

03:57.203 --> 03:59.939
-(thunder rumbles)
<i>-There, I see an old drunkard</i>

04:00.039 --> 04:03.543
<i>stumbling home past</i>
<i>the old stone wall.</i>

04:03.610 --> 04:04.877
<i>And there, out of</i>
<i>the corner of my eye,</i>

04:04.944 --> 04:07.914
<i>I caught a glimpse</i>
<i>of something stirring</i>
<i>in the brine,</i>

04:07.981 --> 04:10.450
<i>some sort of</i>
<i>hideous creature.</i>

04:10.550 --> 04:12.785
<i>Its tentacles,</i>
<i>they rise up out</i>
<i>of the water.</i>

04:12.885 --> 04:14.454
<i>And before I knew it,</i>
<i>it grabbed him.</i>

04:14.554 --> 04:15.788
<i>I tried to warn him,</i>
<i>but it was too late.</i>

04:15.888 --> 04:17.123
<i>The creature had him now,</i>

04:17.223 --> 04:20.126
<i>in his grasp,</i>
<i>flinging him around</i>

04:20.226 --> 04:23.263
<i>before wringing him out</i>
<i>like a fucking bar rag.</i>

04:23.329 --> 04:25.131
(frightful music playing)

04:28.568 --> 04:29.936
And that poor wretch?

04:32.739 --> 04:34.340
That was my dad.

04:36.075 --> 04:40.013
Bruh. Kraken killed
Blackbeard's pa.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.181
The good news is,
my dad was a dick.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.616
(all chuckle)

04:45.118 --> 04:45.852
And I learned
something that night:

04:45.952 --> 04:50.089
fear is the most
powerful emotion.

04:50.156 --> 04:55.461
Turn your enemy's worst fear
against them, you'll own them.

04:55.528 --> 04:57.664
-I've often said that.
-(all disagree)

04:57.764 --> 04:58.931
I've definitely said that.

04:58.998 --> 05:00.033
Frenchie:
Maybe you said
it on your own.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.768
Yeah, I may,
uh, you-- Yeah.

05:01.834 --> 05:03.002
I may have
been on my own.

05:03.102 --> 05:05.038
But on that note...

05:05.138 --> 05:09.042
how do you... go about
tapping into an enemy's fear?

05:09.142 --> 05:10.143
You really
want to know?

05:10.209 --> 05:12.211
Yeah, I think we'd
all be curious.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.814
-Right, gang?
-(all agree)

05:14.881 --> 05:17.350
Well, maybe, I will
tell you, someday.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.455
But be careful what
you ask your God for...

05:22.522 --> 05:24.490
(ominous music plays)

05:24.557 --> 05:25.191
<i>She might just answer.</i>

05:29.495 --> 05:31.497
-Captain! Avast ye!
-Ooh!

05:31.564 --> 05:34.801
There's somethin'
witchy afoot!

05:34.867 --> 05:36.569
What?!
What, what you
talking about?

05:38.037 --> 05:39.072
Witchy?!

05:40.473 --> 05:41.207
How?!

05:42.475 --> 05:44.243
♪ ♪

05:46.045 --> 05:48.715
Never known
a fog like this.

05:48.815 --> 05:50.883
It's abnormal.

05:51.517 --> 05:53.319
Tastes abnormal, too.

05:56.222 --> 05:58.358
I suppose it
is a tad off.

05:58.424 --> 05:59.525
Anyone seen Blackbeard?

05:59.592 --> 06:02.428
-Blackbeard: Over here, child.
-Oh god. He's there!

06:02.528 --> 06:03.429
(thunder)

06:03.529 --> 06:05.665
-Agh!
-Ow, you bit me! What the fuck?!

06:05.732 --> 06:07.533
I thought you were
the demon, boy!

06:07.600 --> 06:09.068
Or am I here?

06:10.336 --> 06:10.370
What?

06:12.572 --> 06:17.243
-(thunder)
-Flee and survive,
or face me and burn!

06:17.343 --> 06:20.713
-(maniacal laughter)
-(fearful shouting)

06:23.416 --> 06:25.351
Every man for himself!

06:25.418 --> 06:29.188
Oh, whoa, hey, okay!
Boys, give it a rest!

06:29.255 --> 06:30.390
We've got a man overboard!

06:34.360 --> 06:36.763
Ugh, it's a bit too much
atmosphere anyway.

06:36.863 --> 06:37.296
It's my fault,
boss!

06:41.801 --> 06:43.302
It's all an illusion!
Brilliant!

06:43.403 --> 06:47.540
Exactly.
Or as I like to call it,
The Art of Fuckery.

06:47.607 --> 06:52.779
Sorry, laddie.
Ye triggered my fight
or bite response.

06:52.879 --> 06:54.247
Why do I have a splinter?

06:54.313 --> 06:56.983
Oh... that'll be
from me "summer" teef.

07:00.620 --> 07:02.789
-Some are teef.
-Oh my god.

07:02.889 --> 07:05.792
Some ain't.
(laughs)

07:05.892 --> 07:07.794
-May I have a word?
-Captain Stede: It's a bit
like theater isn't it, Ed?

07:07.894 --> 07:09.162
The Theater of Fear.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.997
Ha! "Theater of Fear."
Love that.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.499
His name is Blackbeard, dog!

07:15.168 --> 07:16.903
Well, I'll leave you to it.

07:16.969 --> 07:17.970
It looks like there's
trouble in paradise.

07:18.070 --> 07:19.939
Can you get up here
and let me out of this thing?

07:20.006 --> 07:22.675
-I can't feel my balls.
-But, but we need to talk.

07:22.775 --> 07:23.776
What the fuck you doin'
with your head
between my legs?

07:23.843 --> 07:26.279
-Stop. Unbuckle the fuckin'--
-(Izzy grumbling)

07:26.345 --> 07:29.849
-No, you're tightening it!
No, shut up! Up on top here.
-(Izzy grumbling)

07:29.949 --> 07:31.984
-That's my-- no, that's my hips.
-That's it! That is it!

07:32.084 --> 07:35.855
You seem to know
everything about everything
in the whole fuckin' world!

07:35.955 --> 07:38.157
(stammering)

07:38.257 --> 07:39.325
Blackbeard:
Izzy!

07:40.126 --> 07:41.160
Izzy!

07:42.094 --> 07:43.162
Izzy!

07:43.262 --> 07:44.964
That was embarrassing!

07:50.002 --> 07:52.472
You left me hangin' up
there for 20 minutes.
Not bloody optimal.

07:55.007 --> 07:55.374
What the fuck's
all this?

07:58.611 --> 08:01.380
Do you remember
your policy about pets
aboard your vessel?

08:01.481 --> 08:04.350
Pets? Yeah. No pets.
They befoul the ship.

08:04.450 --> 08:05.718
Ivan:
You know what
else you said?

08:05.818 --> 08:08.554
You said
the love of a pet
makes a man weak.

08:08.654 --> 08:11.290
-I said that?
-Yeah, when
I joined your crew,

08:11.357 --> 08:13.192
you made me
put my dog down.

08:13.292 --> 08:16.562
Yeah, okay, well, yeah,
vaguely... remember that.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.364
So, here's the rub:
Me and the boys,

08:18.464 --> 08:19.866
we think you've
begun to view

08:19.966 --> 08:20.867
Bonnet as
a sort of a pet.

08:20.967 --> 08:22.235
-Mm-hm.
-Hm.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.904
Izzy:
You're in too deep, Edward.

08:25.004 --> 08:26.072
Best thing to do...

08:26.172 --> 08:28.574
-end it quick.
-Yeah.

08:28.674 --> 08:30.576
The longer you wait,
the harder it gets...

08:32.979 --> 08:33.379
(cries)
They're just pets.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.250
(Fang crying)

08:39.151 --> 08:41.153
It's all right, Fangy.

08:41.220 --> 08:43.656
He's up in doggy
heaven now, mate.

08:43.723 --> 08:46.058
Yeah, but we go
to different heavens!

08:46.158 --> 08:46.492
(wailing)

08:49.328 --> 08:52.064
He goes to doggy heaven.

08:52.164 --> 08:54.901
(ominous music playing)

08:57.036 --> 08:58.504
I'll happily end it.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.208
No.

09:03.009 --> 09:04.410
It's my mess.
I'll do it.

09:06.913 --> 09:08.848
Maybe while he's doing
something he loves.

09:08.915 --> 09:10.249
Captain Stede:
Oh, there you are!

09:10.349 --> 09:13.553
Hey, according
to Buttons,

09:13.619 --> 09:17.423
we should cross paths
with a Dutch merchant
ship tomorrow night.

09:17.523 --> 09:19.358
I thought we could take it
through a bit of Fuckery.

09:19.425 --> 09:22.261
Oh, mate, that's
a bit advanced for you.

09:22.361 --> 09:25.097
A good Fuckery takes
ages to develop.

09:25.197 --> 09:27.033
Izzy:
As much as
I hate to admit it,

09:27.099 --> 09:29.268
Captain Bonnet's theatrical
instincts are finely honed.

09:29.368 --> 09:32.071
He's more than
up to the challenge.

09:32.138 --> 09:34.874
Well, thank you.
Maybe I misjudged you.

09:35.608 --> 09:36.576
Let's do it!

09:36.642 --> 09:41.047
Lucius!
We've got a Fuckery
on our hands!

09:41.113 --> 09:43.282
What are you doing?
You know he's
not up for this.

09:43.382 --> 09:44.450
Oh, of course not...

09:44.550 --> 09:46.485
but he would be doing
something he loved.

09:49.889 --> 09:52.124
It's time, Edward.

09:52.224 --> 09:56.495
Send him to doggy heaven.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.297
Storytelling.
Tell me a story. Go.

09:58.397 --> 10:01.300
-Me?
-Yes, engage me. Go!

10:01.400 --> 10:02.635
On the day
I was born,

10:02.735 --> 10:07.106
-the rain looked
just like blood--
-Boring! Next!

10:07.173 --> 10:10.242
I yearn to make sweet
love to the sea--

10:10.309 --> 10:12.945
Whoa, way too personal!

10:13.579 --> 10:14.480
Go.

10:16.682 --> 10:18.651
-Ah--
-Come on, spit it out!

10:18.751 --> 10:20.820
-I have one.
-Terrible.

10:20.920 --> 10:21.520
All of these stories

10:21.621 --> 10:24.023
are very bad.
Thankfully,

10:24.123 --> 10:25.324
we do have a Master of Horror,

10:25.424 --> 10:28.361
one William Shakespeare,
at our disposal.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.863
What if I hack up
a dummy with an axe?

10:30.963 --> 10:34.667
Maybe have like...
meat and guts and stuff
comin' out of it.

10:34.767 --> 10:39.138
I once witnessed
a man eatin' another
man's face once.

10:39.205 --> 10:41.173
That was pretty vulgar.

10:41.273 --> 10:43.676
That's actually
quite a cheap scare.

10:43.776 --> 10:46.779
I'm thinking more along
the lines of psychological.

10:46.846 --> 10:51.283
-I've always wanted to sing.
-Singing's not scary.

10:51.350 --> 10:53.853
Well, maybe
it doesn't always
have to be scary.

10:53.953 --> 10:56.689
Maybe, sometimes, it can be
an expression of ourselves.

10:56.789 --> 11:00.893
Anyone smell that?
Kinda like a...
a dead person smell?

11:02.128 --> 11:05.197
-(all gagging)
-Oh, Lord above.

11:05.297 --> 11:07.066
Black Pete:
Oh my god.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.402
My finger feels like fires.

11:12.204 --> 11:15.508
All right, this rehearsal
is already a disaster.

11:15.574 --> 11:18.044
Let's take 20.
Get him to the infirmary,

11:18.144 --> 11:19.178
and that's a taut 20.

11:19.245 --> 11:22.715
Fuck... Fuck!

11:22.815 --> 11:26.419
I got his head,
I got his head,
I got his head.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.054
Get around,
I'll hold him here.

11:28.154 --> 11:30.389
(all muttering)

11:30.489 --> 11:31.924
(flies buzzing)

11:32.024 --> 11:34.226
You're a doctor?
I thought you
were the cook.

11:34.326 --> 11:37.730
Mm, knives are knives,
meat's meat.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.736
Seems to me
the best move here
is... amputation.

11:43.836 --> 11:45.871
Oh, for God's sake!
He's a visual artist.

11:45.938 --> 11:48.240
You can't cut the boy's
little fingies.

11:49.041 --> 11:50.876
Level with us, man.

11:50.943 --> 11:54.246
-There's no better option?
-Not in my professional opinion.

11:54.346 --> 11:56.515
-Hold him down.
-Okay.

11:56.582 --> 11:58.784
I'll whack it off in one go.
Or two. Or three.

11:58.884 --> 12:02.855
-What's happening? Am I dead?
-Uh, no, no, no, baby.

12:02.922 --> 12:04.757
(screams)
No! No!

12:04.857 --> 12:07.760
-It's just a dream!
-Black Pete: Hey,
where are you goin'--

12:07.860 --> 12:10.262
This is all a dream.
Come back!

12:17.970 --> 12:20.639
Muse, why have you forsaken me?

12:24.977 --> 12:25.644
Izzy:
How goes the Fuckery?

12:29.915 --> 12:31.217
What are you doing in here?

12:31.283 --> 12:33.219
I've just been
takin' in your library.

12:34.754 --> 12:37.389
What a perverse
misuse of space.

12:37.456 --> 12:41.460
Still, it's a nice room.
Lots of possibilities.

12:41.560 --> 12:42.962
Yes, well,
I designed it for flow.

12:43.062 --> 12:44.830
So, if you'd kindly piss off,
the Fuckery's canceled.

12:47.433 --> 12:48.400
You can't cancel it.

12:48.467 --> 12:51.937
I went out on a limb for you,
you little shit.

12:52.004 --> 12:54.907
Not my problem.
Why'd you even do it
in the first place?

12:54.974 --> 12:59.078
Because it's my job
to make sure that
Edward is content.

12:59.145 --> 13:01.447
And he adores you.

13:02.982 --> 13:06.685
Why, I'll never know,
but... he does.

13:08.587 --> 13:09.655
So, plumb the depths, man.

13:12.525 --> 13:16.695
Perform... like it's
your last day on Earth.

13:19.298 --> 13:20.833
(footsteps receding)

13:20.933 --> 13:24.670
-You're doin' the-- He's gonna--
-(indistinct chatter)

13:24.770 --> 13:26.205
Captain Stede:
Hello.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.774
I'd like to apologize for
my, my behavior earlier.

13:28.841 --> 13:32.678
As total as my theatrical
knowledge may be,

13:32.778 --> 13:35.614
-I did forget
the most important thing.
-Oh, to be interesting?

13:35.681 --> 13:35.781
Company.

13:37.850 --> 13:38.717
We are a company.

13:38.818 --> 13:43.055
Um, and so, this work
is a shared vision.

13:43.155 --> 13:45.858
Now, we've only got
a couple of hours to put
this thing together.

13:45.958 --> 13:48.360
Yeah, we've already
figured it out,
actually, mostly.

13:48.460 --> 13:50.563
-What?
-Yeah, we figured out a bunch
of, like, really scary stuff.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.865
-Yeah.
-And I'm going to sing.

13:52.965 --> 13:54.567
Yeah, right,
The Swede's
gonna sing.

13:54.667 --> 13:55.968
Anyways, it's gonna
be excellent.

13:56.035 --> 13:58.370
The one thing
we haven't got
is the finale.

13:58.470 --> 14:01.140
Hm, I may have something.

14:02.875 --> 14:05.578
Something that'll
really plumb the depths.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.050
You're a killer, bro.
You're a fuckin' killer.

14:11.150 --> 14:13.652
So kill!

14:17.189 --> 14:20.993
-Uh, Mr. Blackbeard, sir?
-Yeah?

14:21.060 --> 14:23.495
Uh, we'll be approaching
the vessel in a few moments,

14:23.562 --> 14:25.764
and Captain wanted me
to show you to your seat.

14:26.532 --> 14:30.870
All right.
Let's do this.

14:30.936 --> 14:32.605
So, Captain figures that

14:32.705 --> 14:36.242
this will be
the best view for you

14:36.342 --> 14:38.010
for when they
come aboard.

14:38.944 --> 14:40.279
-When they come aboard?
-Yeah.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.281
No, no.
Aren't we supposed
to be raiding them?

14:42.381 --> 14:45.417
Yeah, he's reimagined
things a bit, all right?

14:45.517 --> 14:49.388
(ominous music playing)

14:56.262 --> 14:58.864
Appears abandoned, right?

14:58.931 --> 15:01.267
Yeah, I mean,
seems like it, right?

15:01.367 --> 15:03.969
All:
Yeah, yeah.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.539
Well, let's go have a look.

15:07.606 --> 15:11.310
Hello? Anybody home?

15:11.410 --> 15:13.779
Only us spirits...

15:13.879 --> 15:18.617
from the wretched,
burning depths
of Hades, methinks!

15:18.717 --> 15:20.986
The Swede:
What is wrong, Nederlandska?

15:21.086 --> 15:23.622
Have you stumbled
onto something...

15:23.722 --> 15:27.826
...beyond your comprehension?
Ha-ha!

15:27.927 --> 15:32.998
Um, are those supposed
to be the same guys?

15:33.098 --> 15:35.434
With very different
hairstyles, no?

15:35.501 --> 15:40.406
I am a witch,
and this is my cat!

15:40.472 --> 15:44.610
-(meows and hisses)
-(cackling)

15:46.078 --> 15:49.782
Ooh, hey!
The opening went great.

15:49.848 --> 15:52.818
-I thought I heard laughter.
-Oh, no. That was screams.

15:52.918 --> 15:55.020
-(indistinct chatter)
-Oh, here they come. Watch this.

15:58.257 --> 16:00.459
(frantic violins playing)

16:02.494 --> 16:05.531
(meowing)
I'm the Black Cat of Death.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.035
(laughing)

16:12.471 --> 16:13.505
-(growling)
-Captain, look!

16:13.605 --> 16:16.108
Hello?
What is happening here?

16:16.709 --> 16:19.511
Terrifying, isn't it?

16:19.611 --> 16:22.348
Yeah, man, it's...
scary as hell.

16:26.285 --> 16:28.654
(Jim laughing)

16:29.788 --> 16:32.358
(screaming)
Have mercy!

16:32.458 --> 16:34.193
(wild laughter)

16:34.293 --> 16:35.060
(door opens)

16:37.730 --> 16:38.964
Ooh!

16:39.031 --> 16:40.199
They can't cut off my finger

16:40.299 --> 16:41.900
if there's no finger to cut off.

16:44.470 --> 16:46.572
(Dutch sailors exclaiming)

16:48.140 --> 16:49.908
(all gagging)

16:50.009 --> 16:52.177
Shit, that was incredible.

16:52.244 --> 16:54.079
-How'd you do that?
-I don't know.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.914
I'll have to ask
the little bugger.

16:56.015 --> 16:59.752
(angelic singing)

16:59.852 --> 17:03.489
-Oh, this is my cue.
-Is that The Swede?

17:03.555 --> 17:06.658
Yeah, that's our little
Nordic angel.

17:06.725 --> 17:09.061
Keep watching.
Big finale coming up.

17:09.161 --> 17:12.564
It would appear the siren's
song has awoken a beast!

17:12.664 --> 17:16.001
Not mere whale nor shark.

17:16.068 --> 17:18.337
'Tis the greatest
terror of the sea!

17:18.404 --> 17:20.773
The Kraken!

17:21.340 --> 17:23.075
Enough nonsense!

17:23.175 --> 17:25.511
(banging on window)

17:27.346 --> 17:30.749
(dark violin playing)

17:33.786 --> 17:36.855
(yelling)

17:37.523 --> 17:39.258
(crying)

17:39.358 --> 17:40.926
-Blackbeard!
-Ooh!

17:41.026 --> 17:44.029
-Blackbeard! Blackbeard!
-(all exclaiming)

17:46.098 --> 17:48.100
(breathing heavily)

17:51.403 --> 17:53.872
-(all shouting)
-Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!

17:53.939 --> 17:57.142
-Black Cat of Death!
-Good pussycat!

17:57.242 --> 18:01.113
-Bravo, Wee John! Bravo.
-(cheers, laughter)

18:01.213 --> 18:03.082
(knock on door)

18:03.148 --> 18:05.250
Edward?
You all right?

18:06.385 --> 18:07.286
(knocks on door)

18:07.386 --> 18:09.288
-Edward?
-(knocking continues)

18:09.388 --> 18:11.223
Slop!

18:12.891 --> 18:15.394
You want to tell me why
that's all you ever cook?

18:16.128 --> 18:18.263
It's what
we can afford.

18:19.331 --> 18:20.466
-(slaps)
-(Mother winces)

18:22.134 --> 18:23.569
I gotta get
out of here.

18:26.405 --> 18:27.272
(door slams)

18:28.941 --> 18:29.007
(door breaks)

18:30.676 --> 18:31.910
Captain Stede:
Edward!

18:34.580 --> 18:35.414
Ed?

18:41.353 --> 18:43.255
The Kraken didn't kill my dad.

18:44.756 --> 18:46.091
<i>I did.</i>

18:46.158 --> 18:48.093
(thunder rumbling)

18:48.160 --> 18:49.495
(young Blackbeard groaning)

18:50.629 --> 18:52.030
I'm the Kraken.

18:55.200 --> 18:59.204
If I'm honest...
I haven't killed
another man since.

19:01.473 --> 19:02.207
Not personally.

19:04.943 --> 19:08.480
I mean... I have seen
you maim some people.

19:08.547 --> 19:11.016
Maiming's different.
Love a good maim.

19:12.351 --> 19:15.154
But... I always
outsource the big job.

19:17.489 --> 19:20.459
And tonight...

19:20.526 --> 19:24.029
I'm supposed to kill... you.

19:26.899 --> 19:27.032
Oh.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.869
I was supposed to burn
off your face...

19:32.871 --> 19:34.740
and take your identity.

19:36.141 --> 19:37.242
And, um...

19:39.578 --> 19:41.513
is that still on the cards, or?

19:43.649 --> 19:45.551
(relieved sigh)

19:46.652 --> 19:49.221
You don't belong
in doggy heaven.

19:50.822 --> 19:52.157
Doggy heaven?

19:53.992 --> 19:55.661
Is that a pirate term, or?

19:58.197 --> 20:01.767
I'm not a good person, Stede.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.101
That's why I don't
have any friends.

20:07.172 --> 20:09.208
Hey...
I'm your friend.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.879
-No.
-Listen, what if...

20:13.946 --> 20:15.447
what if we just
pretended that

20:15.547 --> 20:17.449
whole murder idea
never happened?

20:18.350 --> 20:21.620
(sniffles)

20:21.720 --> 20:24.122
We could?

20:24.223 --> 20:28.193
I mean, I could...
if you could.

20:28.894 --> 20:31.797
I think I might like that.

20:31.897 --> 20:35.400
(sighs) I would love that.

20:40.872 --> 20:41.907
Thank you.

20:44.810 --> 20:47.412
(pirates cheering)

20:51.283 --> 20:53.285
Bravo, everyone!

20:53.385 --> 20:57.122
So, uh, Blackbeard,
what did you think?

20:57.222 --> 21:00.125
Wonderful Fuckery.
Scared the pants off me.

21:00.225 --> 21:02.327
I thought Blackbeard
didn't feel fear.

21:02.427 --> 21:04.963
-And I didn't, until today.
-Whoa.

21:05.063 --> 21:06.164
And you,
what a voice!

21:06.265 --> 21:10.502
-Me? Oh, come on.
Don't tease me.
-Uh-huh.

21:10.602 --> 21:12.938
Oh, he's not teasing.
You sounded like an angel.

21:13.005 --> 21:15.240
-Well done.
-(cheers and applause)

21:15.307 --> 21:17.743
And Lucius!
Quite the feat.

21:17.809 --> 21:19.645
-Even though it was his hand.
-(laughing)

21:19.745 --> 21:22.347
-Where is he?
-Shh. He's asleep.

21:22.447 --> 21:26.585
Stede Bonnet!
Draw your weapon.

21:26.652 --> 21:29.187
-No, Izzy, we're not doing this.
-No, you're not doin' this...

21:30.922 --> 21:32.324
so I must.

21:33.925 --> 21:37.763
Stede fuckin' Bonnet...

21:39.097 --> 21:42.868
I fuckin' challenge you
to a fuckin' duel.

21:48.307 --> 21:51.209
-Well, I accept your challenge.
-(all murmuring)

21:51.310 --> 21:52.811
Uh, he's really
pretty good.

21:52.878 --> 21:55.013
Stede, be careful.
He does know his shit.

21:55.113 --> 21:57.449
As do I.
You've taught me well.

21:58.383 --> 21:58.617
Not that well.

21:58.684 --> 22:00.052
Right.

22:00.152 --> 22:03.855
I'm assuming standard
duel rules apply.

22:04.890 --> 22:07.192
What are those exactly?

22:07.292 --> 22:10.062
Let's make
it interesting,
shall we?

22:10.162 --> 22:11.730
The loser is banished
from the ship...

22:11.830 --> 22:14.333
if they're not dead.

22:14.399 --> 22:16.068
(Captain Stede yelping)

22:16.168 --> 22:18.870
Come on.
Give a man a warning.

22:18.970 --> 22:21.173
That was your warning.

22:21.239 --> 22:23.809
-Come on, Cap.
-Psych him out. That's it.
Nice. Wiggle the hips.

22:23.875 --> 22:26.311
Nice, Captain.

22:26.378 --> 22:27.679
Good, yes!

22:27.746 --> 22:28.413
(swords clanking)

22:30.382 --> 22:31.216
(yells)

22:31.316 --> 22:32.551
Frenchie:
Oh, you cheeky bitch.

22:32.651 --> 22:33.251
(yelling)

22:38.657 --> 22:40.092
Yield or die.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.729
I choose... this.
Aaah!

22:43.829 --> 22:47.232
-Oh!
-(cheers and applause)

22:47.332 --> 22:49.434
-Do it now!
-Ha-ha!

22:49.534 --> 22:52.337
No! Stab him!
For fuck's sake.

22:55.173 --> 22:56.908
Frenchie:
Come on, Captain!

22:57.008 --> 22:58.343
Ah... Ah!

23:01.279 --> 23:02.447
(sword clatters)

23:04.616 --> 23:07.285
So, it looks like
we've arrived, Bonnet.

23:07.386 --> 23:08.720
The end of the road.

23:12.424 --> 23:14.526
All right...
let's call it a draw.

23:15.026 --> 23:16.928
Nah, I'm good.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.766
-(screams)
-Ooh!

23:25.704 --> 23:26.438
Did I do it right?

23:26.538 --> 23:29.641
He missed all
the important bits.

23:32.778 --> 23:35.881
(grunting)

23:35.947 --> 23:37.449
This mast...

23:37.549 --> 23:41.286
it's made from the finest
cherry wood in Brazil.

23:41.386 --> 23:45.557
-It's rather strong, actually.
-Shut up!

23:45.624 --> 23:48.660
Don't you ever shut up,
you rancid rat!

23:48.760 --> 23:50.729
(sword cracks)

23:52.097 --> 23:54.332
(Buttons laughs)

23:54.433 --> 23:55.300
Well, now,
Mr. Hands.

23:55.400 --> 23:59.938
Reckon he's rendered
your sword inoperable.

24:00.005 --> 24:02.841
-By dueling tradition,
that means--
-Stede wins!

24:02.941 --> 24:04.910
(all cheering)

24:04.976 --> 24:07.813
In your face, Jizzy!

24:07.913 --> 24:10.182
(crew laughing)

24:11.483 --> 24:12.951
Aaaaah!

24:14.686 --> 24:15.821
Well played, Cap'n.

24:15.921 --> 24:17.456
(jaunty music playing)

24:19.758 --> 24:21.660
Thanks, Buttons.

24:21.760 --> 24:23.361
So, is this it then?

24:23.462 --> 24:25.430
You're actually
allowing this?

24:25.497 --> 24:26.998
You shouldn't've
dueled him, Iz!

24:27.098 --> 24:28.433
We could've
worked this out.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.502
You will rue this day, Edward.

24:30.602 --> 24:33.271
You will rue it long
and you will rue it hard.

24:33.338 --> 24:38.276
Hey...
made you a sandwich
for the trip.

24:38.343 --> 24:39.711
-(grunts)
-Ivan: Hey!

24:39.811 --> 24:45.050
-I would've eaten that.
-A fucking pox on all of you.

24:47.519 --> 24:48.820
Well, that's that.

24:49.988 --> 24:55.026
Not for nothing,
but that guy really
is a dick, huh?

24:55.126 --> 24:58.029
-(light music playing)
-Thank you.

25:00.065 --> 25:05.303
Today... we commit
a piece of our beloved
Lucius to the sea.

25:06.738 --> 25:08.707
Begone, you foul thing!

25:08.807 --> 25:11.510
-(cheers and applause)
-A tad inelegant.

25:11.576 --> 25:14.679
He could've skimmed it like
a stone or something festive.

25:15.981 --> 25:16.715
So...

25:16.815 --> 25:19.317
uh, listen.

25:19.384 --> 25:23.054
I, I thought I was
gonna lose you.

25:23.154 --> 25:25.090
Oh yeah.
Well, you nearly did

25:25.190 --> 25:26.725
'cause I had
a really bad infection, so.

25:26.825 --> 25:28.093
Exactly.

25:28.660 --> 25:31.396
And, uh, and...

25:31.496 --> 25:34.399
death, you know...
I'm used to death,

25:34.499 --> 25:40.205
but, um... but not,
um... your death.

25:41.039 --> 25:42.941
Uh, so, anyway,

25:43.041 --> 25:45.443
I, uh, made this for you.

25:45.544 --> 25:49.581
It looks like a thumb,
but... it's a finger.

25:49.681 --> 25:52.350
I whittled it.
It's, it's dumb.

25:52.417 --> 25:53.618
You don't have to wear it.

25:58.423 --> 25:59.524
I love it.

26:00.292 --> 26:03.261
And I didn't
know you whittled.

26:03.361 --> 26:04.896
There's a lot you
don't know about me.

26:06.231 --> 26:08.300
Actually, that's kind of it.

26:11.202 --> 26:11.436
(winces)

26:13.772 --> 26:15.373
-You good?
-I, I would love it out.

26:15.440 --> 26:18.276
The, uh, um, I--
I'll go get someone.

26:18.376 --> 26:20.111
-Please.
-You keep breathin'.

26:20.211 --> 26:21.613
-Thank you. Please.
-Okay.

26:21.713 --> 26:22.781
It's been a while.

26:22.881 --> 26:23.448
(grunting)

26:34.225 --> 26:37.896
So, I was thinking, um,
should we serve food?

26:37.963 --> 26:39.831
Be a whole other
revenue stream, you know?

26:39.931 --> 26:43.635
-A theme night,
or maybe Singles Night--
-Shut the fuck up.

26:43.735 --> 26:45.303
I don't pay you to think.

26:45.403 --> 26:48.473
Food means kitchen,
menus, waitstaff.

26:48.573 --> 26:50.308
You think I wanna
mess with a waitstaff?

26:50.408 --> 26:52.744
You think Jackie don't have
enough overhead as it is?

26:52.811 --> 26:55.747
I've a more lucrative
proposal in mind.

27:01.920 --> 27:02.520
If you're open to it.

27:06.925 --> 27:07.592
Get this man a drink.
