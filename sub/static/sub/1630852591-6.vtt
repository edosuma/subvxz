00:20.770 --> 00:23.398
Do you believe in a world
other than our own?

00:25.025 --> 00:27.152
Perhaps you've been
walking home late at night

00:27.235 --> 00:29.362
and felt someone watching you,

00:30.196 --> 00:31.448
but when you turn,

00:32.115 --> 00:33.491
no one was there.

00:34.868 --> 00:38.496
Perhaps you catch a glimpse of yourself
across a crowded room.

00:39.205 --> 00:40.790
No, not a mirror,

00:41.833 --> 00:43.209
but another you.

00:44.502 --> 00:48.715
Some may turn away
from these strange occurrences

00:48.798 --> 00:50.175
and never look back.

00:50.258 --> 00:51.342
But others,

00:52.469 --> 00:54.971
they may wonder
if they've caught a glimpse

00:55.472 --> 00:57.223
into another world.

00:58.641 --> 01:02.562
A dimension separated from ours
by the thinnest of veils.

01:03.354 --> 01:05.190
A realm of infinite power

01:06.316 --> 01:07.776
and infinite horror.

01:08.735 --> 01:12.906
Where time is ever-expanding
and ever-contracting.

01:14.491 --> 01:17.035
And if this other world exists,

01:18.745 --> 01:21.831
some believe it lies
at the very center of…

01:23.166 --> 01:24.793
the Circle.

02:42.287 --> 02:43.413
<i>Hey, Danny.</i>

02:45.832 --> 02:47.750
<i>I can't believe you're eight.</i>

02:47.834 --> 02:51.588
<i>You know, I remember</i>
<i>the first moment I saw you.</i>

02:51.671 --> 02:53.047
<i>I thought to myself,</i>

02:53.756 --> 02:58.219
<i>"Here is a boy that will love</i>
<i>stop-motion skeletons just as much as me."</i>

02:59.429 --> 03:04.058
<i>Anyway, now you don't have to wait</i>
<i>for old dad to get out the projector.</i>

03:04.142 --> 03:07.228
<i>Now you can watch all these greatest hits</i>

03:07.312 --> 03:09.397
<i>until your eyeballs fall out.</i>

03:11.357 --> 03:12.775
<i>Happy birthday, son.</i>

03:14.235 --> 03:15.236
<i>I love you.</i>

03:39.969 --> 03:42.055
-Hello?
<i>-Dan, I'm outside.</i>

03:42.931 --> 03:43.932
Mark?

03:44.849 --> 03:46.351
I've been leaving you messages.

03:46.434 --> 03:49.145
You can't say you're gonna launch
a rescue through time-space continuum

03:49.229 --> 03:50.063
and not call me back.

03:50.146 --> 03:51.898
You're not supposed to be here.

03:51.981 --> 03:53.191
I was worried.

03:53.274 --> 03:54.776
-Gonna let me in or not?
-I can't.

03:54.859 --> 03:56.402
This whole place is under surveillance.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.404
Seriously? Still living in a fishbowl?

03:58.488 --> 04:00.782
I thought you would've
shut that shit down by now.

04:00.865 --> 04:03.534
Hijacked the feed,
replaced it with 24-hour Tarkovsky.

04:03.618 --> 04:05.620
I'm fine. I'm sorry you came all this way.

04:05.703 --> 04:07.747
Dude, come on,
it took forever to get here.

04:07.830 --> 04:10.583
I got lost,
I'm fucking freezing, I'm hungry.

04:11.167 --> 04:12.669
I found Thomas Bellows.

04:15.463 --> 04:16.547
Guy with the notebooks.

04:23.846 --> 04:26.641
I found his girlfriend, um, Alicia Flores.

04:26.724 --> 04:29.310
She said Davenport hired him,
like, six years ago,

04:29.394 --> 04:33.106
offered him a shit ton of cash to digitize
a bunch of old VHS tapes, soap operas,

04:33.189 --> 04:35.441
thousands of hours of stuff
from like 20, 30 years ago.

04:35.525 --> 04:36.609
Wait, soap operas? Why?

04:36.693 --> 04:38.444
I don't know, she wouldn't say.

04:38.528 --> 04:41.197
She signed some kind of, um, NDA
after the accident and--

04:41.281 --> 04:42.615
Wait, what accident?

04:42.699 --> 04:45.493
A few weeks after he wrapped the job here,

04:46.077 --> 04:48.955
he died in a single-car accident
up in Nova Scotia.

04:49.038 --> 04:50.999
She said Thomas lost his shit up here.

04:51.082 --> 04:54.752
Like paranoid delusions, mania,
the whole nine yards.

04:55.795 --> 04:59.549
You said you've been seeing things here.
You said you've been seeing Melody.

05:00.091 --> 05:01.050
Mark,

05:02.468 --> 05:03.594
I'm fine.

05:04.178 --> 05:05.555
I promise.

05:05.638 --> 05:06.848
Go home.

05:06.931 --> 05:08.641
I'll see you when I get back.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.226
Dan. Dan!

05:32.999 --> 05:34.625
<i>Fuck your fishbowl.</i>

07:46.340 --> 07:47.216
What…

07:48.718 --> 07:49.802
What the fuck?

07:49.886 --> 07:51.012
Okay.

07:52.889 --> 07:53.890
It's, um…

07:55.433 --> 07:56.767
I don't know what day it is,

07:56.851 --> 07:59.770
but I woke up
in someone's apartment and I…

08:00.855 --> 08:03.733
don't know where I am
and I don't know how I got here.

08:59.455 --> 09:00.414
Melody Pendras?

09:03.000 --> 09:05.795
We're following up on
the death of a tenant last night.

09:05.878 --> 09:07.922
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

09:09.799 --> 09:12.343
<i>I was at</i>
<i>an art show with a friend</i>,

09:12.969 --> 09:16.013
and then I walked home and, um…

09:17.473 --> 09:20.351
talked to someone
who lives in the building,

09:20.434 --> 09:21.811
and then he just…

09:22.937 --> 09:24.230
Chris just…

09:26.107 --> 09:27.066
fell.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.527
Right in front of us.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.947
So you knew the victim.

09:33.823 --> 09:34.740
No.

09:35.533 --> 09:36.576
I mean, um…

09:37.410 --> 09:38.578
Yes, sort of.

09:39.370 --> 09:40.663
I met him yesterday.

09:41.497 --> 09:44.625
I was interviewing him
for a project here in the apartment.

09:49.046 --> 09:50.464
Thank you for your time.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.800
We'll be in touch
if we have more questions.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.349
He didn't jump.

10:01.350 --> 10:05.187
I know that's what you think,
but he didn't jump. He was pushed.

10:06.063 --> 10:07.273
You saw someone push him?

10:07.356 --> 10:08.316
No.

10:09.108 --> 10:10.109
But I…

10:10.735 --> 10:13.613
He wanted to get clean,
he wanted to get out.

10:14.363 --> 10:16.949
There's this man in the building,
Samuel Spare, and he--

10:17.033 --> 10:17.992
Professor Spare.

10:18.075 --> 10:19.952
Yeah, we spoke to him this morning.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.705
He said he was with you
at the time of the incident.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.168
He is not who he says he is.

10:27.251 --> 10:29.253
He is not a fucking professor.

10:29.337 --> 10:30.796
Here, I have proof.

10:32.798 --> 10:35.092
What? No, no, no. No.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.346
He took them.

10:39.388 --> 10:40.681
He took the books.

10:43.017 --> 10:46.395
There's this priest from St. Albert's,
Father Russo.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.564
He died on the subway tracks
the other night,

10:48.648 --> 10:50.733
and I think Samuel pushed him too.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.568
Maybe you and Chris weren't strangers?

10:54.028 --> 10:56.322
-Maybe you were using together?
-What?

10:56.405 --> 10:59.075
No. No, I don't do drugs.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.619
Look, just go up to the sixth floor,

11:01.702 --> 11:04.163
and there are all these people
locked up in there.

11:04.246 --> 11:06.999
And Samuel has got them
hooked on this drug and it's…

11:11.379 --> 11:12.546
Thank you for your time.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.976
-Hello?
-<i> Melody Pendras?</i>

11:26.060 --> 11:27.144
Yes.

11:27.228 --> 11:28.771
<i>This is Stuyvesant Health Center.</i>

11:28.854 --> 11:31.232
<i>We're calling about a patient</i>
<i>named Anabelle Cho.</i>

11:43.077 --> 11:44.537
That's correct…

11:49.625 --> 11:50.668
Anabelle?

11:52.420 --> 11:53.713
Anabelle.

11:55.131 --> 11:56.006
Hey.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.509
Hey, what happened?

12:04.348 --> 12:06.350
Why are you handcuffed to the bed?

12:11.689 --> 12:13.232
She has a message.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.652
She's in there.

12:18.779 --> 12:20.448
Who has a message?

12:25.244 --> 12:26.287
Anabelle.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.624
Anabelle, what happened?

12:30.708 --> 12:32.543
She broke a woman's jaw.

12:40.301 --> 12:41.135
What?

12:41.218 --> 12:43.053
Someone named Gabby Stanton.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.807
She also stabbed a security officer
in the eye with a nail.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.978
No, no, no, that… that can't be right.

12:51.061 --> 12:53.689
She was hallucinating
when they brought her in last night.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.775
Does she have a history of mental illness?

12:55.858 --> 12:57.735
Schizophrenia or bipolar disorder?

12:57.818 --> 13:00.237
-No, nothing like that.
-Any history of drug use?

13:00.321 --> 13:02.114
Nothing came back on the tox screen,

13:02.198 --> 13:05.159
but methamphetamines or ketamine
could cause a drug-induced psychosis.

13:05.242 --> 13:06.619
What about mold?

13:07.453 --> 13:08.329
Mold?

13:09.622 --> 13:11.665
She's been using this paint.

13:12.374 --> 13:14.293
I think it's made out of some kind of mold

13:14.376 --> 13:15.669
that grows in our building.

13:16.212 --> 13:19.131
The moment she started using it,
she was a completely different person.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.175
It's possible.

13:22.009 --> 13:25.262
Ingesting or breathing a neurotoxic mold
could cause hallucinations

13:25.346 --> 13:27.014
or other kinds of neurological damage.

13:27.097 --> 13:29.350
If I get you a sample, can you help her?

13:29.433 --> 13:32.061
And please, can you take
those fucking handcuffs off?

13:32.144 --> 13:33.354
She isn't this person.

13:34.063 --> 13:36.148
Anabelle would never hurt someone.

13:37.566 --> 13:38.901
Bring me the sample.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.402
-I'll see what I can do.
-Okay.

13:41.195 --> 13:42.321
Cassandra.

13:45.449 --> 13:46.784
Cassandra!

13:47.493 --> 13:49.578
Oh, well, you're quite a sight.

13:58.212 --> 13:59.713
Where is it? The paint.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.842
That poisonous fucking paint.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.177
It's mold, isn't it? Toxic mold?

14:05.261 --> 14:06.303
Mold?

14:06.387 --> 14:08.639
I wouldn't know anything about that.
It's Eleanor's paint.

14:08.722 --> 14:10.182
Where is it?

14:10.266 --> 14:12.768
I'm afraid I gave it all to Anabelle.
You'll have to ask her.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.145
Anabelle had a psychotic break last night.

14:15.229 --> 14:16.730
But you know that, don't you?

14:16.814 --> 14:18.691
You were there. You saw it happen.

14:18.774 --> 14:20.359
You saw them arrest her.

14:20.442 --> 14:23.445
We thought she was strong enough.
I thought she'd bear up.

14:24.905 --> 14:25.781
What?

14:27.491 --> 14:30.619
Well, we wouldn't let anyone else
have them, of course.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.371
She opened a window.

14:32.454 --> 14:34.915
I knew she was special
the moment I met her.

14:34.999 --> 14:37.167
She's a true Spirit Receiver.

14:37.251 --> 14:38.669
Just like my Eleanor.

14:38.752 --> 14:40.087
Fuck Eleanor.

14:40.170 --> 14:41.881
What did you do to her?

14:41.964 --> 14:44.008
What window did she open?

14:44.091 --> 14:45.926
Who is that woman in the paintings?

14:46.010 --> 14:47.887
What the fuck did you do to Anabelle?

14:47.970 --> 14:48.971
Melody.

14:51.807 --> 14:52.683
I'm sorry.

14:54.184 --> 14:56.312
You need to leave with me right now.

14:58.689 --> 15:00.357
I'm not supposed to see you anymore.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.484
What? Why?

15:02.568 --> 15:03.944
Who told you that?

15:07.323 --> 15:08.365
Samuel.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.242
He says you're not well.

15:11.493 --> 15:12.912
Okay, that's bullshit.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.706
He's a liar, and I'm fine.

15:16.498 --> 15:17.708
I think you should go.

15:18.834 --> 15:20.753
Look, I can't let you stay here.

15:20.836 --> 15:21.754
It's not safe.

15:21.837 --> 15:25.299
Cassandra is not a good person
and neither is Samuel.

15:25.966 --> 15:28.969
You don't have to come with me,
but I need you to leave this apartment.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.095
-No.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.276
It's in the tea, isn't it?

15:47.696 --> 15:51.659
You've been poisoning her the whole time,
just like you poisoned Anabelle.

15:51.742 --> 15:53.494
Don't be ridiculous.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.454
It's just tea.

15:56.121 --> 15:57.623
You saw me buy it, Melody.

15:59.750 --> 16:02.127
That jar I saw you with in the elevator,

16:02.211 --> 16:04.046
it was mold, wasn't it?

16:04.797 --> 16:06.298
Where did you get it?

16:08.884 --> 16:10.010
Please.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.347
I need to take a sample to the doctor.

16:14.890 --> 16:16.392
I need to help Anabelle.

16:17.768 --> 16:18.727
Jess.

16:20.521 --> 16:21.480
She's sick.

16:22.773 --> 16:25.150
She's very, very sick.

16:33.075 --> 16:34.201
You need a key.

19:11.984 --> 19:12.860
<i>There you are.</i>

19:16.989 --> 19:18.157
<i>This room is--</i>

19:20.075 --> 19:20.909
Fuck.

20:15.964 --> 20:17.049
Oh, shit.

20:38.445 --> 20:39.571
<i>Dan.</i>

20:39.655 --> 20:41.573
Everything's infested with mold.

20:42.658 --> 20:43.784
<i>Mold?</i>

20:43.867 --> 20:44.868
Mold.

20:45.827 --> 20:48.205
The deck, the tapes, everything.

20:49.122 --> 20:51.500
Where the fuck did it come from?
How did it get here?

20:52.668 --> 20:54.836
Well, I… I don't know, Dan.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.463
You were asked to be meticulous.

20:56.546 --> 20:59.258
It's the same shit that
was growing at the Visser, okay?

21:00.008 --> 21:01.343
<i>What is it doing here?</i>

21:02.135 --> 21:03.512
<i>How is this possible?</i>

21:06.265 --> 21:09.685
Dan, are you currently experiencing
a mental health emergency?

21:10.727 --> 21:11.645
No.

21:11.728 --> 21:14.439
'Cause I can send a professional
there right now, assess--

21:14.523 --> 21:17.943
I'm not experiencing
a fucking mental health emergency.

21:21.029 --> 21:22.781
If I remember right,

21:22.864 --> 21:26.243
you requested
more than one deck in your specs when…

21:27.619 --> 21:28.996
we were setting the place up.

21:29.079 --> 21:31.248
That means there should be a spare unit.

21:31.331 --> 21:34.584
Did you look for the spare unit?

21:34.668 --> 21:37.629
<i>Because if you choose</i>
<i>not to complete the job--</i>

21:53.020 --> 21:55.147
What the fuck?

21:55.731 --> 21:57.190
How did you get in here?

21:57.274 --> 21:59.443
Ratty, don't eat that-- Okay.

22:32.517 --> 22:34.353
<i>Hey, hey, hey, Alicia.</i>

22:35.437 --> 22:37.814
<i>So I thought I would go ahead</i>
<i>and keep a video log,</i>

22:37.898 --> 22:41.276
<i>because I want you to have proof</i>
<i>of how much I fucking miss you.</i>

22:41.902 --> 22:42.819
<i>Okay?</i>

22:43.487 --> 22:47.407
<i>I don't know what's so top secret</i>
<i>about digitizing shitty old soaps, but…</i>

22:48.825 --> 22:50.452
<i>no visitors allowed.</i>

22:50.535 --> 22:52.579
Holy fuck, Ratty.

22:53.246 --> 22:55.248
<i>Okay, well, I'm gonna get to it.</i>

22:55.332 --> 22:56.708
Thomas Bellows.

22:56.792 --> 23:00.921
<i>So, Davenport has me keeping a journal</i>

23:02.214 --> 23:05.926
<i>so he knows I'm watching all this shit</i>

23:06.635 --> 23:09.304
<i>and I'm not missing anything.</i>

23:10.806 --> 23:13.016
<i>You wouldn't believe</i>
<i>how stupid these soaps are.</i>

23:13.100 --> 23:17.646
<i>You know,</i>
<i>it's all aliens and identical twins.</i>

23:17.729 --> 23:19.731
<i>Hey, my handwriting,</i>

23:20.690 --> 23:22.359
<i>it's really gonna improve, babe.</i>

23:22.442 --> 23:24.277
<i>Huh? Not bad, right?</i>

23:26.113 --> 23:26.988
<i>Anyway,</i>

23:27.697 --> 23:30.534
<i>you are not gonna believe my love letters.</i>

23:38.417 --> 23:43.547
<i>Okay, babe,</i>
<i>I am about halfway through the tapes.</i>

23:46.800 --> 23:49.469
<i>I just wish that I never had to sleep</i>

23:49.553 --> 23:51.221
<i>because then I could be home faster.</i>

24:01.523 --> 24:03.316
<i>I'm sorry about last night.</i>

24:03.400 --> 24:07.487
<i>This… This job</i>
<i>is sucking the life out of me.</i>

24:07.571 --> 24:10.532
<i>But we are gonna have enough</i>

24:12.117 --> 24:14.202
<i>to pay off our student loans.</i>

24:14.286 --> 24:15.829
<i>We're gonna have everything.</i>

24:17.289 --> 24:20.125
<i>Tommy B. loves you, Alicia Flores.</i>

24:24.045 --> 24:26.298
<i>Babe, you gotta see this.</i>

24:26.381 --> 24:27.466
<i>This guy…</i>

24:28.091 --> 24:29.801
<i>This guy had some kind of a…</i>

24:29.885 --> 24:32.804
<i>a DNA company that he shut down.</i>

24:34.681 --> 24:36.057
<i>Wellspring.</i>

24:36.141 --> 24:37.100
<i>Okay?</i>

24:37.642 --> 24:39.478
<i>But it looks like a crock of shit to me.</i>

24:39.561 --> 24:41.688
<i>I mean, I think</i>
<i>it's just a big fucking front</i>

24:41.771 --> 24:43.690
<i>for collecting personal data.</i>

24:47.360 --> 24:48.987
<i>He's looking for someone, babe.</i>

24:51.865 --> 24:53.366
<i>Who is he looking for?</i>

24:56.369 --> 25:00.165
<i>And why the fuck is there blood</i>
<i>in these refrigerators?</i>

25:00.248 --> 25:01.249
<i>Look at this.</i>

25:05.212 --> 25:08.381
<i>I know you think I'm paranoid, babe.</i>
<i>You think I'm losing my shit.</i>

25:08.465 --> 25:11.468
<i>But I just need to talk to you</i>
<i>and you won't take my calls--</i>

25:23.939 --> 25:29.069
<i>There is a face in the screen, and…</i>

25:33.615 --> 25:34.866
<i>I'm… I'm not crazy.</i>

25:35.784 --> 25:36.993
<i>I'm not crazy.</i>

25:37.536 --> 25:38.578
<i>You see it?</i>

25:40.080 --> 25:40.997
<i>You see it?</i>

25:43.917 --> 25:44.960
<i>It's in there.</i>

25:45.585 --> 25:46.920
<i>It's watching me.</i>

25:54.344 --> 25:57.722
<i>Fuck you and your tapes, Patricia.</i>

25:59.391 --> 26:00.850
<i>What did you get up to?</i>

26:02.310 --> 26:05.105
<i>What did you get up to? Huh?</i>

26:06.022 --> 26:07.357
<i>Fuck you!</i>

26:10.068 --> 26:11.987
<i>What did you put in them?</i>

26:12.070 --> 26:14.030
<i>What did you put in them? Huh?</i>

26:21.162 --> 26:22.330
Patricia.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.377
<i>I'm retired now.</i>
<i>I stay home and record things.</i>

26:29.212 --> 26:30.255
<i>Soaps, honey.</i>

26:30.922 --> 26:33.592
<i>But other things too.</i>
<i>I record as much as I can.</i>

26:33.675 --> 26:35.385
<i>Started out with a real nice Betamax,</i>

26:35.468 --> 26:38.680
<i>and now I have two VHS machines,</i>
<i>top of the line.</i>

26:39.723 --> 26:40.849
<i>I feel like…</i>

26:42.809 --> 26:44.894
<i>they have a message for me.</i>

27:49.084 --> 27:51.044
<i> This is Mark Higgins</i>
<i>with </i>Mystery Signals.

27:51.127 --> 27:52.462
<i>Please leave a detailed message</i>

27:52.545 --> 27:54.464
<i>and I'll return your call</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

27:55.465 --> 27:56.883
Okay, look, um…

27:57.550 --> 27:58.802
about Thomas Bellows…

27:58.885 --> 28:01.012
Those tapes he was digitizing, the soaps,

28:01.096 --> 28:03.348
they belong to that woman from the Visser.

28:03.431 --> 28:05.141
The fucking Visser.

28:05.225 --> 28:06.226
He said…

28:07.268 --> 28:10.355
He said he thought he saw something
in the tapes, some kind of face.

28:11.231 --> 28:12.649
I think I saw it too.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.193
At first I thought
I was imagining it, but--

28:17.612 --> 28:19.739
Fuck. Come on.

28:19.823 --> 28:21.658
You find
what you were looking for?

28:23.118 --> 28:26.246
Davenport said you had
a problem with the equipment?

28:26.329 --> 28:27.956
That you needed a replacement deck?

28:28.540 --> 28:29.791
I found it.

28:33.002 --> 28:34.671
There was someone here before me.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.549
What was he doing? What happened to him?

28:41.886 --> 28:43.555
Don't make the same mistake.

28:44.180 --> 28:45.807
Finish the job.

28:46.599 --> 28:48.643
Take the money. Walk away.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.271
And never look back.

29:15.628 --> 29:17.338
How the fuck did you get in here?

29:17.422 --> 29:20.008
You just take off in the middle
of the day like that, professor?

29:20.091 --> 29:21.760
There was an estate sale.

29:21.843 --> 29:22.844
Well, where's George?

29:23.803 --> 29:25.263
Had to let George go.

29:26.139 --> 29:27.098
Huh.

29:27.182 --> 29:28.558
Business is that good, huh?

29:29.225 --> 29:30.643
What do you want, Mark?

29:31.811 --> 29:34.731
I heard a rumor that

29:34.814 --> 29:37.317
Evie Crest suffered a stroke last week.

29:37.400 --> 29:39.694
Her son decided
to strip the estate for its parts

29:39.778 --> 29:41.780
and sell off Granddaddy's archive.

29:43.031 --> 29:44.991
Newly excavated tapes and all.

29:50.413 --> 29:52.665
Come on, Jill, I know you've got them.

29:54.250 --> 29:56.294
Only reason you know
about the Crest collection

29:56.377 --> 29:58.755
is because of Dan's
weird obsession with <i>The Circle.</i>

30:00.548 --> 30:03.426
I went by the museum last week.
They said he didn't work there anymore.

30:03.510 --> 30:05.553
Yeah, he's out of town right now.

30:07.096 --> 30:07.931
Where?

30:08.014 --> 30:09.474
Sorry, that's classified.

30:12.393 --> 30:16.147
It's not for sale. Especially not to you
and your shitty podcast.

30:17.690 --> 30:18.900
Listen,

30:20.068 --> 30:23.655
Dan's never gonna forgive you
for fucking the film festival guy,

30:24.239 --> 30:25.782
even if you buy him this pony.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.159
So you might as well

30:29.035 --> 30:30.161
let me pay you for it.

30:31.913 --> 30:33.456
Everybody wins.

30:34.958 --> 30:37.752
Apparently,
William Crest was a real nutter.

30:37.836 --> 30:41.548
He, uh, used to run with
those Agape Lodge guys in Los Angeles,

30:41.631 --> 30:45.218
dabbled in Mankind United,
Theosophy, you name it.

30:45.301 --> 30:48.388
But this stuff is different.

30:49.681 --> 30:54.018
The papers he kept, they're all about some
obscure cult based in New York City,

30:54.769 --> 30:55.979
the Vos Society.

30:57.021 --> 30:59.524
I did some digging.
I couldn't find shit about them,

30:59.607 --> 31:02.861
so they must have been
short-lived and very obscure.

31:03.903 --> 31:07.740
And I don't know how he stumbled
on all this stuff in the first place, but…

31:09.033 --> 31:11.286
he used all this research
to write <i>The Circle.</i>

31:13.496 --> 31:15.081
The scripts aren't bad.

31:20.545 --> 31:21.963
The woman in the middle,

31:22.714 --> 31:23.965
she's the ringleader.

31:24.591 --> 31:26.092
Iris Vos.

31:26.175 --> 31:27.802
Very Madame Blavatsky.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.555
She came over from Europe
after World War I,

31:30.638 --> 31:32.640
made a fortune in textiles.

31:32.724 --> 31:35.768
Evie Crest claimed that
<i>The Circle </i>was inspired by a…

31:36.811 --> 31:40.773
snuff film her father saw at some
skull-and-bones party in the '40s.

31:40.857 --> 31:42.233
Any chance that turned up too?

31:48.323 --> 31:49.574
It's a copy.

31:49.657 --> 31:52.577
Someone ran a print
and shot it with an 8-millimeter camera.

31:53.494 --> 31:57.540
The footage was damaged to begin with,
so the 8-mill made it double shit.

31:57.624 --> 31:59.459
Can't see much.

32:08.676 --> 32:10.011
Holy shit.

32:20.855 --> 32:24.943
The estate tried to unload this
on three other dealers first.

32:26.486 --> 32:27.904
The rumor is…

32:29.072 --> 32:31.908
this stuff is cursed.

32:32.492 --> 32:34.369
The tapes, the books,

32:34.911 --> 32:36.287
this film,

32:36.371 --> 32:37.538
all of it.

32:39.916 --> 32:42.627
Well then, today's your lucky day,
because I'm…

32:44.045 --> 32:45.922
gonna take it all off your hands.

32:48.758 --> 32:50.385
Just finish the job.

32:50.927 --> 32:53.596
Finish the fucking job.

33:08.277 --> 33:09.112
<i>There you are.</i>

33:09.195 --> 33:12.407
<i>I came back this morning</i>
<i>with coffee and croissants,</i>

33:12.949 --> 33:15.535
<i>but, uh, you were already gone.</i>

33:17.036 --> 33:19.372
What the fuck
was I doing in your apartment?

33:20.206 --> 33:21.791
How did I get there?

33:21.874 --> 33:23.459
What did you do to me?

33:25.753 --> 33:27.296
You really don't remember?

33:27.880 --> 33:28.965
You fainted.

33:29.757 --> 33:32.260
It was awful.
There was all that blood and I…

33:32.969 --> 33:38.808
I didn't have a key to your apartment,
so I carried you up to mine. I'm…

33:41.394 --> 33:44.981
I am so sorry if I scared you.

33:45.732 --> 33:47.817
I just didn't want
to leave you on the street.

33:50.486 --> 33:51.612
What is all this?

33:52.613 --> 33:54.407
This… It's storage.

33:55.658 --> 33:59.245
Well, it used to be storage
before it flooded a few years ago.

33:59.328 --> 34:01.831
Need to store something?
John can get you a locker next door.

34:01.914 --> 34:02.874
This.

34:04.083 --> 34:05.251
What is this?

34:14.218 --> 34:15.970
Wow, I don't… I don't know.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.848
-It must be some kind of water damage.
-Bullshit.

34:18.931 --> 34:22.602
You've been sending Jess down here
to scrape this shit off the walls.

34:24.187 --> 34:26.230
You think I don't know about the drugs?

34:26.898 --> 34:30.777
You think I don't know
that Cassandra puts this in Jess's tea?

34:31.694 --> 34:34.489
Or that it's in the paint
that drove Anabelle insane?

34:39.035 --> 34:40.286
What is it?

34:42.914 --> 34:48.044
I guess if I had to answer that,
I would say it is, uh…

34:54.592 --> 34:56.594
It's proof of our devotion.

35:01.057 --> 35:03.184
It's a manifestation of the divine.

35:05.686 --> 35:09.357
It's the matter of a shared universe.

35:13.569 --> 35:14.737
Body and blood.

35:22.662 --> 35:23.996
Let me show you something.

35:28.167 --> 35:31.671
Melody, you have been
searching for answers your whole life.

35:32.588 --> 35:34.799
I have those answers
if you're willing to listen.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.555
Let me show you.

36:05.997 --> 36:10.126
Did you know that the Visser
was built on the ruins of a mansion?

36:13.671 --> 36:15.590
It belonged to the Vos family.

36:29.270 --> 36:30.313
What…

36:34.275 --> 36:35.860
What is that song?

36:36.694 --> 36:38.029
It's not a song.

36:39.322 --> 36:40.323
It's a prayer.

36:40.907 --> 36:43.201
And I know that
it's painful for you to hear.

36:43.784 --> 36:46.495
That's how I knew that
you were the one I was looking for.

36:46.579 --> 36:47.705
That night,

36:49.040 --> 36:50.416
at the opera.

37:17.568 --> 37:19.612
"Entity known as Kaelego."

37:22.990 --> 37:25.243
"Cited as both god and demon."

37:54.522 --> 37:56.232
And just so you know,

37:56.315 --> 37:58.818
I resent the word "cult."

38:00.319 --> 38:01.862
We're pioneers.

38:02.989 --> 38:04.240
Of the imagination.

38:05.908 --> 38:07.201
We're voyagers.

38:09.328 --> 38:10.705
We're seers.

38:14.959 --> 38:16.961
Was my mother one of your seers?

38:19.380 --> 38:20.381
No.

38:21.716 --> 38:23.592
I'm sorry, I never knew your mother.

38:25.594 --> 38:27.388
She never lived at the Visser.

38:29.765 --> 38:31.350
I sent the letter to the convent.

38:33.894 --> 38:35.062
What?

38:35.146 --> 38:37.606
I was hoping

38:38.524 --> 38:41.986
that you would come looking for
the thing you wanted most in the world.

38:42.611 --> 38:44.613
And you did.

38:45.406 --> 38:47.908
And Professor Turner was kind enough to…

38:48.951 --> 38:50.578
to help me find you.

38:52.288 --> 38:54.749
'Cause there aren't many of you out there.

38:54.832 --> 38:56.125
Baldung.

38:57.960 --> 38:59.712
I am so,

39:01.088 --> 39:03.424
so very lucky that I found you.

39:07.303 --> 39:09.138
What the fuck is wrong with you?

39:10.431 --> 39:11.474
Melody.

39:13.309 --> 39:14.352
Please.

39:15.603 --> 39:16.729
Take heart

39:18.022 --> 39:19.231
that this time,

39:20.024 --> 39:21.984
we're going to succeed.

39:23.903 --> 39:26.238
And the whole of time…

39:28.240 --> 39:29.658
will be as one.

39:31.494 --> 39:33.746
I don't know what that's supposed to mean.

39:37.958 --> 39:38.918
It…

39:39.710 --> 39:42.421
means that I am merely

39:43.923 --> 39:46.384
a link in the chain.

39:48.302 --> 39:50.179
I'm a keeper of the flame.

40:07.279 --> 40:08.447
What is that?

40:36.225 --> 40:39.854
Yes, it's exactly the same space.

41:03.127 --> 41:04.962
That's why you brought me here.

41:06.088 --> 41:07.631
To slit my fucking throat.

41:07.715 --> 41:09.925
No. No, no, no. Of course not.

41:10.009 --> 41:12.803
We would never hurt you.
We can't. We couldn't.

41:13.846 --> 41:14.763
We can't.

41:15.723 --> 41:16.640
You…

41:17.933 --> 41:19.894
You are perfectly safe.

41:20.603 --> 41:21.770
We have our volunteer.

41:23.647 --> 41:25.399
Your human sacrifice.

41:26.150 --> 41:27.276
Our vessel.

41:29.236 --> 41:34.366
Capable of holding a whole new world

41:34.450 --> 41:36.076
inside of them.

41:36.660 --> 41:40.456
And everything is possible
in this new world, Melody.

41:42.750 --> 41:44.877
You will be reunited with her.

41:47.588 --> 41:48.589
Your mother.

41:51.300 --> 41:52.468
I promise.

41:55.429 --> 41:57.223
Now open your mind.

42:06.148 --> 42:07.358
Fuck you.

42:55.990 --> 42:57.491
She was never here.

43:01.996 --> 43:03.497
She was never here.

43:05.874 --> 43:08.544
She was never here.

43:09.587 --> 43:11.422
Get out. Get out.

43:11.505 --> 43:13.549
Get the fuck out.

43:33.360 --> 43:34.403
"A vessel."

43:35.946 --> 43:38.699
"Someone to hold
a whole new world inside of them."

43:40.451 --> 43:42.369
"A whole new world inside."

44:19.531 --> 44:22.242
<i>Do you think I could be more?</i>

44:22.326 --> 44:23.285
<i>Than I am?</i>

44:23.369 --> 44:24.453
<i>Like,</i>

44:25.162 --> 44:27.247
<i>do I seem strong enough…</i>

44:29.583 --> 44:32.169
<i>to hold a new world inside of me?</i>

44:34.463 --> 44:35.506
Oh, God.

44:36.882 --> 44:37.841
Jess.

44:40.219 --> 44:41.178
Jess!

44:42.638 --> 44:43.555
Jess!

44:44.348 --> 44:45.349
Erika!

44:46.642 --> 44:48.769
Please, Jess, I need to talk to you.

44:52.356 --> 44:53.315
They're not here.

44:54.024 --> 44:55.609
What do you mean they're not here?

44:56.276 --> 44:57.277
Where did they go?

44:57.361 --> 44:59.571
Florida. They left last night.

45:00.614 --> 45:01.865
That's a fucking lie.

45:01.949 --> 45:03.242
I just saw her.

45:04.118 --> 45:05.035
Jess!

45:27.057 --> 45:28.308
<i>They took her.</i>

45:29.476 --> 45:30.936
<i>They took Jess.</i>

45:40.571 --> 45:42.823
I told you, the sixth floor is off-limits.

45:42.906 --> 45:44.032
Where is she?

45:45.993 --> 45:48.829
-What the fuck did you do with her?
-Don't know what you're talking about.

45:48.912 --> 45:50.372
You fucking took her!

45:51.165 --> 45:53.751
Jess! Jess, can you hear me?

46:14.688 --> 46:17.191
Melody, Jess is gone.

46:17.274 --> 46:18.108
No.

46:19.109 --> 46:21.653
You're a fucking liar.

46:23.197 --> 46:25.199
I'm not gonna let you do this to her.

46:25.866 --> 46:27.409
I'm not going to let you do this.

46:27.993 --> 46:32.164
Let's just go find someplace quiet
where we can talk.

46:32.247 --> 46:33.248
Fuck you.

46:37.377 --> 46:39.838
Melody Pendras?
We need you to come with us.

46:39.922 --> 46:42.883
-Get the fuck away from me.
-Who are you? What are you doing?

46:42.966 --> 46:44.551
-Sir, I need you to step back.
-No.

46:44.635 --> 46:46.512
Please find me.
Please find me. Please find me.

46:46.595 --> 46:49.306
<i>Please find me. Please help.</i>

46:50.349 --> 46:52.392
Melody, you need to come with us.

46:53.101 --> 46:54.019
Fuck you.

46:54.102 --> 46:55.854
Hey, get your hands off of me!

46:59.399 --> 47:01.610
What… What are you doing here?

47:02.528 --> 47:04.029
What the fuck are you doing here?

47:04.112 --> 47:05.614
Everything's gonna be fine.

47:06.782 --> 47:08.992
No. No! No!

47:09.076 --> 47:10.202
No, let me go!

47:10.285 --> 47:13.956
-No, stop! Stop! Let me go!
-Melody, it's fine. We're gonna find you.

47:14.039 --> 47:16.750
<i>-No! Get off me!</i>
<i>-Melody, you're gonna be fine.</i>

47:16.834 --> 47:18.293
<i>Get the fuck off me!</i>

47:52.119 --> 47:53.120
What the fuck?

50:58.055 --> 50:59.431
<i> Who's there?</i>

51:04.644 --> 51:05.812
<i>Do you hear that?</i>

51:12.486 --> 51:14.321
<i>You'd be lost without me.</i>

51:21.828 --> 51:23.580
<i>Purgatory and carnage.</i>

51:24.372 --> 51:25.999
<i>Quite the combination.</i>

51:36.134 --> 51:37.302
<i> Who's there?</i>

51:39.179 --> 51:41.681
<i>But it's been eating me alive</i>
<i>my whole life.</i>

51:42.891 --> 51:43.809
<i>I just…</i>

51:46.645 --> 51:50.440
<i>If there's any chance that she's here,</i>
<i>I need to find her.</i>

51:51.483 --> 51:53.443
<i>I don't care if she doesn't wanna see me.</i>

51:54.111 --> 51:55.612
<i>I need to know who I am.</i>
