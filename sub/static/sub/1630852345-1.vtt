Come on!

00:34.242 --> 00:35.535
No! I lost him!

00:35.618 --> 00:36.745
I got eyes on him.

00:36.828 --> 00:38.913
-So do I!
-[Frostee] I see it too!

00:39.497 --> 00:40.498
I got this.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.961
[Tony] Thought you could get away from me
didn't you, Dr. Honkensquonk?

00:46.546 --> 00:47.714
Get back here.

00:51.885 --> 00:52.969
[Tony] Gotcha!

00:53.052 --> 00:55.096
Woohoo! Make it rain!

01:01.227 --> 01:02.729
[Tony] Yeah! Woohoo!

01:02.812 --> 01:05.148
Alright, Team Toretto got another one!

01:05.231 --> 01:09.027
-[groans] Why did we go with that name?
-Too late! I already typed it in.

01:09.110 --> 01:12.697
When I heard the city was closing the
streets so y'all could play a dumb game,

01:12.781 --> 01:15.158
I thought it sounded, well, dumb.

01:15.241 --> 01:18.328
-But now, I'm digging it!
-[Frostee] Right, about that...

01:18.912 --> 01:21.539
The city may or may not know
we're playing a game,

01:21.623 --> 01:22.665
so if anyone asks,

01:22.749 --> 01:24.918
this is mission critical.

01:25.001 --> 01:27.295
Oh, and also,
Mitch is part of our team now.

01:27.378 --> 01:29.881
Yeah! We're gonna win this thing!

01:30.465 --> 01:33.343
[Cisco] You know what they say:
teamwork makes the dream work.

Congrats, Monster Manglers!
You've caught all the Grizwalkers,

01:42.519 --> 01:45.939
which means,
you've unlocked the highest level.

01:46.022 --> 01:49.567
Meet the manliest man-bun of them all:

01:49.651 --> 01:51.444
Bunzilla!

01:51.528 --> 01:54.364
[dinosaur] Catch this guy
and you'll win the game.

01:54.447 --> 01:55.740
But it won't be easy.

01:55.824 --> 02:00.453
It's got mega kicks,
and an army of mini-bun guards.

02:01.037 --> 02:02.956
-Let's do it!
-[Layla] Yeah! Get 'em!

02:33.987 --> 02:35.280
Wait, where'd he go?

02:35.864 --> 02:38.241
-[Gary] There. The corner!
-What corner?

02:38.324 --> 02:39.951
Duh! The corner of the street.

02:43.246 --> 02:45.832
[Cisco] I don't see it.
What are you talking about, Gary?

Are you guys seeing something?

Ooh! Nice match, Gares!

for decreasing our screen time,

03:09.272 --> 03:12.567
and thereby, increasing our brain mass.

By the time he gets back from
his mission with Ms. Nowhere,

-Good idea, T.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.375
We separate, wipe out all the mini-buns,

04:52.458 --> 04:55.044
then meet back together
to take down Bunzilla as a team.

we gotta get the coins at the same time
to all get the points. [grunts]

07:43.045 --> 07:46.007
Maybe I accidentally collected
all the coins. I was just excited.

07:46.090 --> 07:50.303
You get excited a lot, T.
Maybe too excited, too much.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.604
You only focused on Bunzilla.

07:59.687 --> 08:01.856
And we took out dumb Mitch for you.

I almost wish he would have won instead.

You don't mean that!

-Maybe we do.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.866
Yeah! There's no "me" in "team", Tony.

08:12.450 --> 08:15.203
Okay, there is an M and an E
that can make a "me,"

08:15.286 --> 08:16.913
but they're not in the right order!

08:16.996 --> 08:20.458
You've got Cisco trying to spell!
That's how upset he is!

08:20.958 --> 08:23.586

08:35.223 --> 08:36.891
Well, Tony...

08:36.974 --> 08:40.686
The last piece is sort of
the most important piece.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.564
What? It's just another piece.
There's 1,000 of them.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.525

08:45.608 --> 08:47.693
-I'm not surprised.
-[sighs] What did I do?

08:47.777 --> 08:49.820
You let everyone do all the hard work,

08:49.904 --> 08:52.698
and then swooped down
to put the last piece in.

08:52.782 --> 08:57.036
Yeah, you take all the glory,
and you do this all the time.

08:57.119 --> 08:58.120
No, I don't.

08:58.204 --> 09:00.498
All. The. Time.

Yeah, a diaper baby!

Okay, maybe that doesn't fit,
but you guys took all the better insults.

09:10.174 --> 09:12.426
Nah, Cisco. It fits.

09:12.510 --> 09:16.597
I'm sorry I can't give you the points.
You know I'm all about my family.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.933
Yeah. Your family.

09:19.016 --> 09:20.351
What does that even mean?

09:20.434 --> 09:23.437
Look, just know that it was
Team Toretto that got the win today.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.481

-Huh?

09:34.448 --> 09:37.326
[T-Spex] You managed to wrangle
the elusive Bunzilla!

But are you ready to race
on our toughest level yet?

I don't have gum disease! [chuckles]

09:58.764 --> 09:59.932

Uh, well, I, uh,
I have to go to the store.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.688
We're low on everything.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.940
I stocked up the fridge 500 pieces ago.

10:08.774 --> 10:12.778
[chuckling] And you forgot the
pickle mayonnaise, you little goofball.

10:12.862 --> 10:14.071
I love pickle mayonnaise.

10:14.155 --> 10:17.742
Gotta go. See ya. Bye-bye.
Be back when I'm back. Love ya!

How did you make it to the championship?

10:29.545 --> 10:32.340
-Uh, with my skills.
-You bought cheat codes, didn't you?

roam around.

a wild horse who must be broken.

11:26.018 --> 11:29.021
You, the best of the best
Champion Players,

11:29.105 --> 11:32.483
must chase R.O.A.M., trap it, and tame it.

11:32.566 --> 11:33.859
Any questions?

11:33.943 --> 11:36.570
Yeah. When you say "tame it,"
how does that work?

11:36.654 --> 11:38.447
-[T-Spex] Great! It's game on.
-[grunts]

11:39.031 --> 11:42.159
