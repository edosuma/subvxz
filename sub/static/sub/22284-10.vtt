- Happy marathon Monday!
- What the?

00:19.841 --> 00:22.308
- What the hell, asshole?
- Nice timing.

00:22.342 --> 00:24.442
Dude, it's our first
marathon Monday.

00:24.476 --> 00:26.814
I've been outside
your door since 4:30.

00:26.849 --> 00:29.118
Let's start drinking!

00:29.152 --> 00:30.821
All right.

00:30.855 --> 00:32.522
- You?
- I'm leaving.

00:32.555 --> 00:33.623
See ya.

00:33.657 --> 00:35.257
Wait. Stay for a beer!

00:35.291 --> 00:37.424
I'm not staying.
But give me your number

00:37.458 --> 00:38.592
And we can go to that
art opening tonight.

00:38.626 --> 00:40.559
- What?
- Yeah!

00:40.594 --> 00:42.328
I would, but my
phone's busted.

00:42.362 --> 00:44.996
Stop lying! Just tell her
you want to spend time

00:45.031 --> 00:46.431
with friends drinking
all day today

00:46.466 --> 00:48.933
and you don't have time
to be bogged down by chicks.

00:48.967 --> 00:50.034
- Just tell her!
- No, that's not

00:50.068 --> 00:51.435
what I'm trying
to say at all, no.

00:51.470 --> 00:53.172
I went jogging. It fell
out of my pocket

00:53.206 --> 00:54.907
and landed in this puddle
and like fried and...

00:56.441 --> 00:57.610
Must be dry now.

00:57.645 --> 00:59.745
- You're an asshole.
- What? I didn't... no,

00:59.780 --> 01:01.379
I didn't... no idea...

01:01.414 --> 01:03.583
Give me your number now!

01:04.917 --> 01:07.485
Alex, hey, what's up,
man? It's Sammy.

01:07.520 --> 01:09.286
Listen, why don't you
stop being a pussy

01:09.321 --> 01:12.021
and open up that beer?
It's marathon Monday!

02:10.211 --> 02:11.245
Nice run.

02:13.214 --> 02:14.849
- What the hell is that?
- Champagne.

02:14.883 --> 02:16.050
- Champagne?
- Yeah.

02:16.084 --> 02:18.085
At practice?
Are you crazy?

02:18.119 --> 02:21.823
It's tradition here. Everybody on
campus drinks from sunup to sunup.

02:21.857 --> 02:24.859
You should come out
with me and Sammy tonight.

02:24.894 --> 02:26.194
<i>I'll run it
by Denise.</i>

02:26.229 --> 02:28.597
<i>Oh, yeah,
that's a "no".</i>

02:31.734 --> 02:35.504
Oh, did you make
a new friend?

02:35.538 --> 02:38.407
I don't know. She
keeps looking over here.

02:42.479 --> 02:44.246
- I'll see you in a bit.
- All right.

02:49.152 --> 02:52.588
Move right.
Move right.

02:52.622 --> 02:54.924
Look the other way!
Look the other way!

02:57.961 --> 02:59.995
I always wanted
to do that.

03:00.029 --> 03:02.965
You've never had sex in
your coach's office before?

03:02.999 --> 03:04.833
No, not in this
coach's office.

03:04.867 --> 03:06.668
Okay. I was gonna say...

03:06.703 --> 03:09.337
So, what's your name?

03:09.372 --> 03:11.406
- No names.
- Even better.

03:11.440 --> 03:13.374
Even better.

03:13.409 --> 03:14.809
<i>Go ahead and
start the meeting.</i>

03:14.843 --> 03:16.043
<i>I left something
in my office.</i>

03:16.078 --> 03:18.645
Shit! Go go go.
You okay?

03:18.680 --> 03:21.448
- Yeah.
- Go go go.

03:21.483 --> 03:22.683
God damn it, I'm so...

03:24.452 --> 03:26.453
Hey, coach!

03:26.488 --> 03:28.923
What the hell are you
doing in my office, Moran?

03:28.957 --> 03:31.458
I'm just admiring
the photo.

03:31.493 --> 03:33.861
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah!

03:33.895 --> 03:35.262
That's my ex-wife Deborah.

03:35.297 --> 03:38.766
Today would have been our
21st wedding anniversary.

03:38.801 --> 03:42.503
God, I miss those tits.

03:42.537 --> 03:45.506
I remember our first date.
I took her to a strip club.

03:45.540 --> 03:47.174
- Nice place.
- Right.

03:47.208 --> 03:49.809
- By the end of the night...
- We're ready for you, coach.

03:56.583 --> 03:59.518
Oh, you dropped
your bandana.

04:01.421 --> 04:02.721
Thank you.

04:04.925 --> 04:06.626
- You all right?
- Oh my God!

04:06.660 --> 04:08.794
Isn't that great?

04:08.828 --> 04:10.729
- Baby?
- Yeah?

04:10.763 --> 04:12.130
Where's my game film?

04:12.165 --> 04:14.599
<i>It should be
in the pile.</i>

04:14.634 --> 04:16.368
I found it.

04:24.044 --> 04:27.513
Say my name.
Say my name.

04:27.547 --> 04:29.348
- Denise!
- That's right.

04:29.382 --> 04:32.517
<i>- Denise.
- Oh, yeah...</i>

04:32.552 --> 04:36.521
Hey, babe. See
anything you like?

04:41.794 --> 04:43.227
You're not a virgin?

04:43.262 --> 04:45.296
I'm a virgin.

04:45.331 --> 04:47.832
Yeah, baby, I'm a virgin.

04:47.867 --> 04:50.201
Virgins don't have sex.

04:50.236 --> 04:53.438
It was just
that one time.

04:53.472 --> 04:55.106
So that was your
first time?

04:55.140 --> 04:58.442
He was a scout
for the patriots.

04:58.477 --> 05:02.647
Oh, so you just decided to
videotape your first time.

05:02.681 --> 05:07.385
Denise, I'm gonna give you one
chance to come clean with me.

05:07.419 --> 05:09.454
How many guys
have you been with?

05:09.488 --> 05:13.825
- Just one. Promise.
- Denise.

05:13.860 --> 05:17.396
- Okay. Promise me you're not gonna
be mad. - I promise. I won't get mad.

05:17.430 --> 05:19.932
Nine.

05:19.966 --> 05:21.600
Nine guys?!

05:21.634 --> 05:22.801
And five girls.

05:24.236 --> 05:26.171
Hey, Craig,
you promised me

05:26.205 --> 05:27.439
Th you would
not get mad!

05:27.473 --> 05:28.940
I'm leaving and I'm
taking all my shit!

05:28.974 --> 05:32.276
No! No, please,
please, baby...

05:32.310 --> 05:33.944
None of this stuff
is even mine!

05:33.979 --> 05:36.046
You don't even
borrow my clothes!

05:36.081 --> 05:38.215
And what's up with those
stupid-ass curtains?

05:38.249 --> 05:40.551
Baby, please.
Baby, just stay.

05:40.585 --> 05:43.654
Why? Huh? So I could
suck your boobs?

05:43.688 --> 05:45.356
Hmm? So I could
dry hump you

05:45.390 --> 05:46.457
With my sweatpants on?

05:46.491 --> 05:50.361
We can have sex.
We can have sex right now.

05:50.396 --> 05:52.364
Come on.

05:54.333 --> 05:56.735
This is over.

06:08.088 --> 06:09.989
Hey, can I get...
I'd like a...

06:10.023 --> 06:10.989
- Hey.
- Two.

06:11.024 --> 06:12.391
Right on.

06:12.425 --> 06:15.294
- Congratulations.
- On what?

06:15.328 --> 06:17.296
Two beers and
two shots, please.

06:21.568 --> 06:23.569
Thank you.
Here you go.

06:23.603 --> 06:25.303
- That's...
- You're welcome.

06:25.337 --> 06:27.038
Thank you.

06:27.073 --> 06:30.843
I'm so glad you came out with
us, man. You never come out.

06:30.877 --> 06:32.111
I broke up with
Denise today.

06:32.146 --> 06:33.546
No way!

06:33.581 --> 06:35.014
That is awesome!

06:35.049 --> 06:36.416
- Alex!
- Yeah?

06:36.450 --> 06:38.117
Yo, Craig broke up
with Denise today!

06:38.152 --> 06:40.554
- That's fantastic!
- He had a girlfriend in college?

06:40.588 --> 06:42.723
I know, right?
Who does that?

06:42.757 --> 06:45.926
We are gonna get
so wasted today!

06:47.396 --> 06:48.463
She was cheating
on me, man.

06:51.599 --> 06:53.867
Which one of you assholes
threw that bottle?

06:53.901 --> 06:55.769
Oh, shit! You know what,
man? Total accident.

06:55.803 --> 06:57.270
Let me buy you
a beer at the bar.

06:57.304 --> 07:00.472
How about
I kick your ass?

07:00.507 --> 07:01.807
How about
I jerk you off?

07:01.841 --> 07:04.143
- Sammy, chill, man.
- What did you say to me?

07:04.177 --> 07:06.712
You heard me. I will
jerk you off right here!

07:06.746 --> 07:08.880
You probably want
to jerk me off!

07:08.915 --> 07:10.516
I do. That's why
I said it.

07:10.550 --> 07:11.817
Now why don't you
shut the hell up

07:11.852 --> 07:14.587
And pull your pants down
so I can jerk you off?

07:14.621 --> 07:19.425
Jerk him off! Jerk him off!

07:23.965 --> 07:25.265
Come on, take it
out, you pussy!

07:25.300 --> 07:26.534
You're crazy.

07:26.568 --> 07:28.903
Yeah, crazy about
jerking you off!

07:28.937 --> 07:29.937
What the hell's
wrong with you, man?

07:29.972 --> 07:32.006
I read at a
fourth-grade level!

07:32.040 --> 07:34.541
All you guys are crazy.

07:36.211 --> 07:38.045
Pussy!

07:39.581 --> 07:41.382
- Is he still gone?
- Yeah, he's gone.

07:41.416 --> 07:46.053
Yo, that's how you win a fight with
against a guy way bigger than you.

07:46.087 --> 07:48.355
Let's do shots!

07:52.827 --> 07:54.728
I did him.

07:54.762 --> 07:57.798
- I did him.
- Oh, did her.

07:57.832 --> 08:02.102
- I did him.
- I did her and her.

08:02.136 --> 08:04.238
And... move out of
the way... and her.

08:04.272 --> 08:06.107
- Did her.
- Did him.

08:06.141 --> 08:07.742
Really?

08:07.776 --> 08:10.544
Look at us, having
things in common.

08:10.579 --> 08:14.381
Give me three good reasons why a
girl like you is in the marching band.

08:14.415 --> 08:16.283
- I'll give you four.
- Okay.

08:16.317 --> 08:17.984
Free football games
every Saturday,

08:18.019 --> 08:20.220
Amazing parties...

08:20.254 --> 08:22.356
Hot guys are constantly
trying to rescue me...

08:22.390 --> 08:24.958
- Right.
- And the irony.

08:24.993 --> 08:28.494
The irony. But isn't band
like a lot of practice?

08:28.529 --> 08:32.032
I play the triangle. I
practice where to stand.

08:32.066 --> 08:34.134
Shit! Why didn't
I think of that?

08:34.168 --> 08:38.304
- Because I'm far smarter than you
are? - I don't know about that.

08:38.340 --> 08:40.274
Four more
years of this.

08:40.308 --> 08:41.575
What could be
better?

08:41.610 --> 08:43.077
Five more
years of this.

08:43.111 --> 08:46.281
At the rate I'm going, five
years is almost definite.

08:46.315 --> 08:48.216
- Good for you.
- Thank you.

08:50.152 --> 08:53.021
I am getting
very messed up.

08:53.055 --> 08:55.590
Leet's go find a party.

08:55.624 --> 08:58.159
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

09:00.095 --> 09:02.629
We gotta hang out
more often, Sammy, man.

09:02.664 --> 09:04.364
I mean, this is fun.

09:04.399 --> 09:06.433
Hey, I like
having fun.

09:06.468 --> 09:09.002
If it's not fun,
I don't want to do it.

09:09.036 --> 09:11.638
Yeah, and I don't need
Denise to have fun.

09:11.672 --> 09:13.740
I got friends
like you for that.

09:13.774 --> 09:15.941
I'm gonna pee and walk.

09:15.976 --> 09:17.843
You gotta pee?

09:17.877 --> 09:19.311
I'll try it.

09:19.345 --> 09:22.314
Hey, poop stains,
we just had 53 beers.

09:22.349 --> 09:24.850
- How does that sound?
- Bam!

09:24.884 --> 09:25.884
Sounds like a lie!

09:25.918 --> 09:27.585
Then how come I got

09:27.620 --> 09:30.154
53 bottle caps
in my pocket?

09:30.188 --> 09:32.490
You probably picked
them up off the ground.

09:32.524 --> 09:36.994
I bet you Craig and I can chug
our 40's faster than you two can.

09:37.028 --> 09:40.463
Oh, yeah?
It's on.

09:50.541 --> 09:52.509
You guys win!

09:54.446 --> 09:57.681
We win! Those guys
are such losers!

09:57.716 --> 10:00.084
I like the way you
live, Sammy, man.

10:00.118 --> 10:02.119
I mean, you don't
give a shit!

10:02.154 --> 10:03.955
It's the only
way to live.

10:03.989 --> 10:07.959
Just stop caring about
everyone and everything.

10:09.429 --> 10:10.963
Remember that movie...

10:10.997 --> 10:13.398
- Who threw that bottle?
- I don't know. You did.

10:13.433 --> 10:15.301
Hey, he was joking.

10:16.436 --> 10:18.604
You assholes must
love marathon Monday.

10:18.638 --> 10:19.905
How many boys you
feel up today?

10:19.940 --> 10:21.606
- Shut up, kid!
- Ignore him.

10:21.641 --> 10:24.276
- What are you doing?
- Relax. You'll see.

10:24.310 --> 10:27.078
Hey, intern, what do
you really want to be?

10:27.112 --> 10:29.614
Like if you went to college
and had goals and stuff.

10:29.648 --> 10:32.183
- A cop. - Way to reach
for the stars, buddy.

10:32.217 --> 10:34.352
- Your parents must be proud.
- Dude, stop.

10:34.386 --> 10:36.521
If I were you, I'd
keep my mouth shut.

10:36.555 --> 10:39.557
Sounds like someone's upset they
couldn't search for coke in my ass.

10:42.095 --> 10:43.695
Dammit, Sean!

10:43.729 --> 10:45.497
He wanted you
to do that.

10:45.532 --> 10:48.400
He was baiting you.
He's got witnesses.

10:48.434 --> 10:50.269
Let him go.

10:50.304 --> 10:53.106
You're free to go.

10:53.140 --> 10:55.809
Always go after
the rookie, man.

11:02.352 --> 11:06.455
Go go go go go!

11:06.490 --> 11:09.325
Yeah! I'm so drunk!

11:12.129 --> 11:13.897
Go go go go go!

11:17.969 --> 11:19.703
- Yes!
- Fantastic!

11:21.106 --> 11:24.675
- Oh! Hello!
- What's up, fellas?

11:24.709 --> 11:26.110
What's going on?

11:26.144 --> 11:27.578
You almost got arrested!

11:27.612 --> 11:29.380
- Yeah.
- What?

11:29.414 --> 11:30.948
That's fantastic!

11:33.251 --> 11:34.618
You bang
my girlfriend?

11:35.987 --> 11:39.122
Hey. You bang
my girlfriend?

11:39.157 --> 11:42.492
- What's going on here?
- We're just partying, man.

11:42.527 --> 11:45.428
No, you pussies
are in love.

11:45.462 --> 11:48.164
- You bang my girlfriend?
- You pussies!

11:48.198 --> 11:50.600
- That's great! - We're not in
love. What are you talking about?

11:50.634 --> 11:52.368
We don't even know
each other's names.

11:52.403 --> 11:54.304
I'm gonna go
get a drink.

11:54.338 --> 11:56.373
- All right.
- Yeah. Good luck.

11:56.407 --> 11:59.076
Did you bang
my girlfriend?

11:59.110 --> 12:02.580
Hey, Alex!

12:02.614 --> 12:03.714
What?

12:03.748 --> 12:05.182
Did you bang
my girlfriend?

12:05.217 --> 12:07.852
- No, why?
- Who cares, man?

12:07.887 --> 12:09.588
Listen, everybody
banged your girlfriend.

12:09.622 --> 12:12.291
Let's get out of here
and go do some dancing.

12:30.141 --> 12:32.676
Dude, stop making out
with her face already

12:32.711 --> 12:35.213
And take her upstairs
and show her your boner.

12:35.247 --> 12:38.282
That's what I do when
I'm pretty horny.

12:39.985 --> 12:42.086
Hey, cutie,
how's it goin'?

12:42.120 --> 12:43.487
Pretty good.

12:43.522 --> 12:46.156
Yeah? I'm with
the marching band.

12:46.191 --> 12:50.528
Do you want to rescue me? Because
I am worth so much more than I know.

12:50.562 --> 12:55.200
I'll rescue you, if by
rescuing you you mean

12:55.234 --> 12:59.038
Taking you to
boner city and back.

12:59.073 --> 13:02.743
That is the most romantic thing
that anyone has ever said to me.

13:08.250 --> 13:10.919
I have a boner
right now...

13:10.953 --> 13:13.588
- Hey!
- Hi... heh heh!

13:13.623 --> 13:16.759
One second.

13:16.793 --> 13:18.227
So, what's going on?

13:18.262 --> 13:20.096
I'm trying to
sleep with this guy.

13:20.130 --> 13:22.031
- Why?
- 'cause he's the dumbest,

13:22.065 --> 13:23.032
Hottest guy at the party.

13:23.066 --> 13:25.034
Ordinarily
I wouldn't care,

13:25.068 --> 13:27.437
But you can't sleep with
him. That is off limits.

13:27.472 --> 13:30.407
I don't want to
know his name, okay?

13:32.210 --> 13:34.578
What about today?
What about us?

13:34.613 --> 13:38.549
Today was great. We should
totally do it again sometime. Okay?

13:40.352 --> 13:41.886
So that's it, then?

13:41.920 --> 13:45.657
Is there something else
you wanted?

13:47.293 --> 13:48.827
No.

13:48.861 --> 13:50.795
No, I don't want
anything else.

13:55.467 --> 13:58.235
You know what? My name's
Alex, by the way.

13:58.270 --> 14:00.404
You're an asshole.

14:04.009 --> 14:07.411
So are we gonna bone
or are we gonna bone?

14:07.446 --> 14:09.614
Maybe later.

14:12.619 --> 14:14.386
Definitely a lesbian.

14:24.598 --> 14:26.600
This is what I needed, man!

14:26.634 --> 14:28.502
Finally, some freedom!

14:28.536 --> 14:31.004
Nothing matters!
Just do what you feel!

14:33.241 --> 14:35.175
Throwing the bottle is my move.

14:35.209 --> 14:36.643
You can't just
steal my move.

14:36.677 --> 14:39.580
Dude, you said do what you
feel. I was feeling that.

14:39.614 --> 14:41.081
- No, but you didn't...
- hey, asshole,

14:41.115 --> 14:42.449
Did you throw
that bottle at me?

14:42.483 --> 14:45.185
I don't think so, man.

14:45.219 --> 14:47.421
I think so. I'm
gonna kick your ass.

14:47.455 --> 14:49.089
How about
I jerk you off?

14:49.123 --> 14:50.357
What did you
say to me?

14:50.391 --> 14:52.258
I said I'd like
to jerk you off!

14:53.994 --> 14:57.062
So what happened?
Why didn't it work?

14:57.096 --> 15:00.165
Those big guys can smell
bullshit from a mile away.

15:00.199 --> 15:02.566
So if you're gonna say
something like that,

15:02.601 --> 15:03.701
You gotta mean it.

15:03.735 --> 15:05.536
What happens if
they pull it out?

15:05.570 --> 15:07.270
I've never gotten that far.

15:07.304 --> 15:10.807
But I imagine I'd
probably just jerk them off.

15:10.841 --> 15:13.276
I mean, I'm not a fighter.

15:13.310 --> 15:15.645
I'm a jerker.

15:20.891 --> 15:21.858
Sammy.

15:21.893 --> 15:24.661
- I need you to come over...
- Deborah?

15:24.695 --> 15:26.196
No. Coach?

15:26.230 --> 15:28.832
Oh, shit!
Who did I call?

15:28.867 --> 15:30.767
It's Alex Moran, coach.

15:30.802 --> 15:31.968
<i>Shit.</i>

15:35.673 --> 15:40.309
You know, I've done so
many things right in my life.

15:40.343 --> 15:43.044
Why is it the one
thing I did wrong

15:43.079 --> 15:46.214
<i>is the only thing
I can't get past?</i>

15:46.248 --> 15:49.850
- You got a wife? - No, coach,
no. I don't have a wife.

15:49.884 --> 15:51.719
<i>Yeah, well, when
you get one, remember</i>

15:51.753 --> 15:55.390
the best thing you can
do for your relationship

15:55.425 --> 15:56.558
is stop caring.

15:56.593 --> 15:58.427
<i>The less you care,</i>

15:58.462 --> 16:00.063
<i>the better off
you're gonna be.</i>

16:00.097 --> 16:02.565
Just let her go.

16:17.482 --> 16:19.850
Excuse me.
Are you Craig Shilo?

16:19.885 --> 16:22.319
Yeah, I'm Craig Shilo.

16:22.354 --> 16:23.420
What happened to you?

16:23.455 --> 16:25.890
I got in a fight.

16:25.924 --> 16:29.594
Oh, poor thing!

16:29.628 --> 16:31.329
If you want,

16:31.363 --> 16:34.132
we could check you out
back at our place.

16:42.810 --> 16:44.277
Let's do it!

16:47.648 --> 16:50.083
I don't want to
throw up on someone.

16:50.118 --> 16:52.619
I know, I know.

16:52.654 --> 16:56.856
- I wanna dance. - Thad,
you're embarrassing yourself.

16:56.891 --> 16:58.391
Ah, there it is!

16:58.425 --> 16:59.792
- Hello.
- Hi.

16:59.827 --> 17:02.729
- Hi.
- Go on, have sex with him.

17:02.763 --> 17:04.696
Look, I panicked, okay?

17:04.732 --> 17:07.066
But I really like you.

17:07.101 --> 17:11.069
And I looked at you and I saw the
next four years of my life tumble away,

17:11.104 --> 17:12.771
- you know?
- I get it.

17:12.806 --> 17:14.406
I get it.

17:14.441 --> 17:16.842
You and I are the same...

17:16.877 --> 17:19.412
You and I are
the same people.

17:19.445 --> 17:23.549
I'm serious. Just take him
into the room and bang him.

17:23.583 --> 17:25.117
You're serious?

17:25.152 --> 17:27.987
We owe it to ourselves to
get drunk and laid tonight,

17:28.021 --> 17:29.622
and not by each other,

17:29.657 --> 17:30.657
because we've
already done that.

17:30.691 --> 17:31.691
- Twice.
- Yeah.

17:31.726 --> 17:33.126
- Yeah.
- It was great.

17:33.161 --> 17:34.995
So what are you gonna do?

17:35.029 --> 17:37.264
I don't know.

17:37.298 --> 17:39.132
I mean...

17:42.637 --> 17:44.004
I think I'm
gonna be okay.

17:44.038 --> 17:45.839
You sure this
is what you want?

17:45.874 --> 17:48.843
No. But it's
the best I can do.

17:51.247 --> 17:52.314
Okay.

17:54.350 --> 17:55.684
Let's do this!

17:58.020 --> 17:59.387
Am I getting
laid?

17:59.422 --> 18:01.590
Yeah, if you can find it.

18:01.624 --> 18:04.260
I'm getting l...
Hey, Larry,

18:04.294 --> 18:06.929
I'm getting laid.
You're my best friend.

18:12.669 --> 18:14.302
My name's Jill.

18:24.281 --> 18:26.215
All right, let's have
a drink, everybody!

18:29.171 --> 18:30.573
<i>Hey, hold on!</i>

19:28.728 --> 19:33.399
Clarence, how much would you
pay for a Craig Shilo sex tape?

19:44.713 --> 19:46.348
Yo, buddy!

19:46.382 --> 19:48.316
Oh, he's got beer!

19:48.351 --> 19:52.588
Hey, not too late to have
one more beer before 6:00.

19:52.622 --> 19:54.657
Nice, nice.

19:56.191 --> 19:59.927
- I thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.

19:59.962 --> 20:01.495
What happened
to you?

20:01.530 --> 20:05.267
I had sex with two nurses.

20:05.301 --> 20:07.002
What the hell?

20:08.605 --> 20:10.806
I've been trying to get
you laid since day one

20:10.840 --> 20:12.775
and all it takes is one
night out with Sammy?

20:12.809 --> 20:14.210
Who are you?

20:14.244 --> 20:15.811
I'm not sure, man.

20:15.846 --> 20:17.546
You'll figure it out.

20:17.581 --> 20:19.415
I got a feeling you're
just getting started.

20:19.449 --> 20:21.183
You're damn right
I'm just getting started.

20:21.218 --> 20:23.152
I'll toast to that.

20:23.186 --> 20:24.787
- Cheers, fellas.
- Yeah.

20:24.821 --> 20:26.856
Happy marathon Monday.

20:28.758 --> 20:29.859
What is that?

20:29.893 --> 20:32.628
That a security golf cart
we drove in there last night.

20:35.766 --> 20:38.768
I got punched in
the face by a cop!
