00:00.967 --> 00:02.134
<i>Previously on "Alias. "</i>

00:02.135 --> 00:03.902
I woke up like it was one night!

00:03.903 --> 00:05.938
I have a scar on my stomach
I have never seen.

00:05.939 --> 00:08.439
You're telling me two years have
passed and I need to be patient?

00:08.441 --> 00:09.441
You have to relax.

00:09.442 --> 00:11.967
I deserve to know what happened
to people in my life!

00:12.045 --> 00:14.545
Sydney can no longer be
your primary concern.

00:14.614 --> 00:16.015
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

00:16.015 --> 00:18.814
Be cruel if you have to.

00:18.885 --> 00:24.289
Make her despise you because
your kindness tortures her.

00:25.158 --> 00:26.692
So what does the prophecy say?

00:26.693 --> 00:30.026
"This woman here depicted
will possess unseen marks.

00:30.096 --> 00:33.156
Signs that she will be the one
to bring forth my works.

00:33.233 --> 00:37.169
At vulgar cost, this woman
will render the greatest power

00:37.237 --> 00:39.737
unto utter desolation. "

00:43.109 --> 00:46.203
You wouldn't do
something like this.

00:48.148 --> 00:50.742
Not to your own father.

00:53.553 --> 00:55.187
Aah!

00:55.188 --> 00:58.749
Now, I'm not
exactly sure what this means.

00:58.825 --> 01:01.385
- What is that?
- What was inside the box.

01:01.461 --> 01:02.795
It's human tissue.

01:02.796 --> 01:06.197
There was a name
etched inside the box.

01:06.666 --> 01:09.166
Milo Rambaldi.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:56.683 --> 01:59.183
Marshall, have you
analyzed the cube?

01:59.252 --> 02:00.886
I wish.

02:00.887 --> 02:02.287
The jerks are here.

02:02.288 --> 02:05.086
Pretentious Classified
Division of Intelligence.

02:05.158 --> 02:07.159
You know,
conspiracy theorists' wet dream.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.127
- I don't understand.
- That's the point.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.363
Who they are exactly
is on a need-to-know basis.

02:11.364 --> 02:15.130
Suffice it to say, their
jurisdiction supercedes ours.

02:15.201 --> 02:17.701
Well, they have a convoy here.

02:17.737 --> 02:19.204
They're taking the cube away.

02:19.205 --> 02:21.173
Wait.
Taking it where?

02:21.174 --> 02:22.641
If I knew, I'd go there.

02:22.642 --> 02:25.010
I should probably
put a tracer on the cube

02:25.011 --> 02:26.345
and track it to their lab.

02:26.346 --> 02:28.447
Imagine how cool
that place would be.

02:28.448 --> 02:29.915
I'm kidding.

02:29.916 --> 02:32.050
Excuse me.
I'm Sydney Bristow.

02:32.051 --> 02:34.386
I recovered that cube.
May I ask what you're doing?

02:34.387 --> 02:37.151
We've been sent to retrieve
the artifact for analysis.

02:37.223 --> 02:39.591
- Sent by whom?
- Department of Special Research.

02:39.592 --> 02:40.592
You're DSR?

02:40.593 --> 02:41.894
We're a division, yes.

02:41.895 --> 02:43.295
Can I ask where
you'll be taking it?

02:43.296 --> 02:44.329
No, you cannot.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.732
If you'll excuse me.

02:46.733 --> 02:48.033
This is unacceptable.

02:48.034 --> 02:51.435
Every time I get close to some
answers, the door gets slammed.

02:51.504 --> 02:52.838
I know.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.540
Lazarey knew
what happened to me.

02:54.541 --> 02:56.341
He led me to that cube.

02:56.342 --> 02:58.177
And before
we just handed it off,

02:58.178 --> 03:01.170
I at least wanted Marshall
to finish his review.

03:01.247 --> 03:02.681
Sydney, listen to me.

03:02.682 --> 03:05.050
We've broken at least
a dozen federal Laws

03:05.051 --> 03:06.752
in pursuit
of what happened to you.

03:06.753 --> 03:08.854
If necessary,
we'll break a dozen more.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.023
But for now,
there's nothing we can do.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.658
We can bring Dixon
into the loop.

03:12.659 --> 03:14.193
This wasn't his call.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.361
The order to remove
the cube came from Langley.

03:16.362 --> 03:18.664
There has to be
something we can do.

03:18.665 --> 03:21.165
We need to re-evaluate
every piece of information

03:21.201 --> 03:22.467
we've collected.

03:22.468 --> 03:25.130
Start from the beginning.
Assume nothing.

03:25.205 --> 03:28.470
Do that, and we may find a lead.

05:00.900 --> 05:03.400
Good to see you.

05:03.469 --> 05:05.969
Kendall.

05:06.572 --> 05:09.072
I'm sorry we had
to do it this way.

05:11.778 --> 05:13.445
You're part of this?

05:13.446 --> 05:16.609
Well, that all depends on
which part you're referring to.

05:16.683 --> 05:18.517
You're Covenant.

05:18.518 --> 05:20.352
No.
No, no.

05:20.353 --> 05:22.853
No, that wouldn't go over
too well at home.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.656
No, I'm with Special Research.

05:25.692 --> 05:30.220
I had a team transporting the
Rambaldi cube to our facility,

05:30.296 --> 05:32.796
and they were ambushed
in transit.

05:35.468 --> 05:37.968
The Covenant got the cube.

05:44.777 --> 05:47.277
What does that
have to do with me?

05:47.880 --> 05:50.380
It has everything
to do with you.

05:53.820 --> 05:56.320
We need to talk
about the past two years.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.323
As you may be aware,
Mr. Kendall,

05:58.324 --> 06:00.492
I have no recollection
of that time.

06:00.493 --> 06:02.227
I know you don't.

06:02.228 --> 06:04.728
But I do.

06:08.468 --> 06:11.028
I know what happened
to you, Sydney.

06:11.104 --> 06:12.971
I know the whole story.

06:12.972 --> 06:15.702
Or most of it.

06:17.310 --> 06:19.544
You've known?

06:19.545 --> 06:21.313
All this time?

06:21.314 --> 06:23.615
Yeah.

06:23.616 --> 06:26.116
Then...

06:26.986 --> 06:29.486
...why haven't you
said anything?

06:31.290 --> 06:34.157
Because you asked me not to.

07:10.196 --> 07:12.230
Place your hand on the scanner.

07:12.231 --> 07:14.859
I need clearance to hear
about my own life.

07:14.934 --> 07:17.434
You understand the information
is classified?

07:17.503 --> 07:19.337
Any unauthorized
disclosure is a violation

07:19.338 --> 07:21.838
of section 23, paragraph 5
of the Patriot Act?

07:21.841 --> 07:23.608
Yes.

07:23.609 --> 07:24.910
Before we get started,

07:24.911 --> 07:26.978
I'm curious about
how you found the cube.

07:26.979 --> 07:28.380
What led you to it?

07:28.381 --> 07:30.048
You got to be kidding me.

07:30.049 --> 07:31.516
Start at the beginning.

07:31.517 --> 07:34.017
I'm all out of patience.

07:35.555 --> 07:38.055
You died.

07:38.758 --> 07:41.318
Or at least we believed you did.

07:42.495 --> 07:44.995
We found a body
in your apartment.

07:45.531 --> 07:48.500
The existing DNA
matched your own.

07:48.835 --> 07:51.599
And I went to your
memorial service myself.

07:51.671 --> 07:56.108
Watched Vaughn spread your ashes
in the sea.

07:57.176 --> 07:59.701
Nine months went by.

07:59.779 --> 08:02.279
One day I got a phone call.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.750
It was your voice.

08:05.751 --> 08:07.252
You were calling from Rome.

08:07.253 --> 08:09.454
You said you had escaped
from The Covenant.

08:09.455 --> 08:11.955
You wanted to come in.

08:13.526 --> 08:15.660
We met at a safe house
in Tuscany.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.863
Does my father know I'm alive?
Does Vaughn?

08:17.864 --> 08:20.424
They will be informed at the
earliest possible opportunity.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.933
What about Will?
Did he make it?

08:21.934 --> 08:23.068
What you've been through

08:23.069 --> 08:25.504
may have National Security
implications.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.806
I need you to get them
on the phone right now!

08:27.807 --> 08:29.875
All your questions
will be answered in time.

08:29.876 --> 08:31.977
First, we need to know
what happened.

08:31.978 --> 08:33.378
You looked different.

08:33.379 --> 08:35.879
It was an alias of yours
I hadn't seen.

08:35.914 --> 08:37.682
I had a lot of questions, too.

08:37.683 --> 08:40.708
We knew almost nothing about
The Covenant at that time.

08:40.785 --> 08:43.414
So you took me back
to the beginning.

08:43.489 --> 08:45.123
You told me the first thing
you remembered

08:45.124 --> 08:48.059
after your fight with Allison.

08:48.728 --> 08:51.856
So this is what happened to you,
in your own words.

08:55.501 --> 08:58.001
I shot her.

08:59.939 --> 09:02.439
Three times.

09:02.975 --> 09:05.475
Then I passed out.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.046
Dead to the world.

09:11.751 --> 09:14.879
When I woke up,
it was days later.

09:14.954 --> 09:19.288
I was in the back of a van,
strapped down.

09:32.805 --> 09:35.501
You and I are going
to work together.

09:36.108 --> 09:39.771
We will spend
lots of time together.

09:40.346 --> 09:45.113
But we will get the results that
my employers have requested.

09:45.184 --> 09:47.846
I always do.

09:52.625 --> 09:56.527
He injected me
with a neurotoxin.

09:57.630 --> 10:00.130
Temporary paralysis.

10:00.166 --> 10:02.666
I couldn't move or speak.

10:04.103 --> 10:06.603
All I could do was watch.

10:10.009 --> 10:12.444
Your roommate was easy.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.512
We unearthed her.

10:14.513 --> 10:18.415
We left her in your apartment
before we burned it.

10:19.185 --> 10:21.286
But you.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.455
That was more difficult.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.186
When a body
is burned badly enough,

10:26.258 --> 10:30.092
the DNA they test for
is in the teeth.

10:31.397 --> 10:35.060
We extracted pulp
from your teeth

10:35.134 --> 10:37.435
and injected it into the teeth

10:37.436 --> 10:41.270
of the corpse that was
to be your replacement.

10:45.878 --> 10:50.076
Of course, they tested
the body they found.

10:51.884 --> 10:55.786
To them, it was you.

11:21.213 --> 11:24.478
He will mourn and move on.

11:24.550 --> 11:27.519
Find someone else, perhaps.

11:32.358 --> 11:39.161
The sooner you accept that
you are no longer who you were,

11:39.231 --> 11:42.530
the easier this will be.

11:44.103 --> 11:50.064
Sydney Bristow is gone.

11:54.847 --> 11:57.182
Why don't I remember
any of this?

11:57.183 --> 11:58.983
I'll get to that.

11:58.984 --> 12:00.518
From your funeral,
you were taken

12:00.519 --> 12:03.019
to a Covenant facility
near St. Petersburg.

12:03.089 --> 12:05.887
This was the man
who took you there.

12:05.958 --> 12:07.959
The man from the van.

12:07.960 --> 12:10.460
Oleg Madrczyk.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.730
I killed this man.

12:15.768 --> 12:18.268
It was only a week after
I woke up in Hong Kong.

12:18.304 --> 12:20.804
He had all the answers.

12:21.807 --> 12:23.274
He died right in front of me.

12:23.275 --> 12:26.039
You kept your promise.

12:26.112 --> 12:28.979
You said you would kill me.

12:30.149 --> 12:32.947
You were my favorite.

12:33.018 --> 12:34.486
Who the hell are you?

12:34.487 --> 12:36.755
What are you talking about?

12:36.756 --> 12:40.157
Why did The Covenant
take two years of my life?

12:43.429 --> 12:44.829
What did he do to me?

12:44.830 --> 12:47.663
The Covenant believed you were
crucial to their operation.

12:47.733 --> 12:51.533
They needed your cooperation,
which you wouldn't offer.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.266
So Oleg began
a brainwash protocol.

12:57.042 --> 13:00.478
He spent months
breaking you down.

13:03.549 --> 13:06.143
He used sensory deprivation.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.953
Electroshock.

13:10.322 --> 13:12.290
He would put you to sleep
by running an I.V.

13:12.291 --> 13:13.792
With a barbiturate into one arm,

13:13.793 --> 13:16.293
and shock you awake with an
amphetamine into the other arm.

13:16.362 --> 13:18.862
I will kill you,
you son of a bitch!

13:18.864 --> 13:21.364
I promise you!

13:21.634 --> 13:23.501
Once Oleg believed
you'd been broken,

13:23.502 --> 13:26.232
he began a conditioning process.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.239
He started with hypnosis.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.936
Your name is Julia Thorne.

13:31.010 --> 13:36.277
You were born in London
on August 2, 1973.

13:36.348 --> 13:39.283
My name is Sydney Bristow,
you ugly bastard.

13:39.351 --> 13:41.519
He disoriented you
with narcotics.

13:41.520 --> 13:45.718
Your name is Julia Thorne.

13:45.791 --> 13:48.954
Really? Then why is my name
Sydney Bristow?

13:49.395 --> 13:52.228
He withheld food
for weeks at a time.

14:23.896 --> 14:26.990
He bombarded you with images,
information.

14:27.499 --> 14:30.559
Classic techniques,
tried and true.

14:30.936 --> 14:34.997
Julia, your father's name
was Kenneth Thorne.

14:35.074 --> 14:36.507
Julia is who you are.

14:36.508 --> 14:39.944
Your two brothers,
Daniel and Tom.

14:40.012 --> 14:42.013
The Latin school.

14:42.014 --> 14:44.949
Confirmation
at the All Souls Church.

14:45.017 --> 14:47.085
After that...

14:47.086 --> 14:49.053
Julia is who you are.

14:49.054 --> 14:51.716
You lost your family in a fire.

14:51.790 --> 14:57.285
After that, you became
a contract killer.

14:58.264 --> 15:03.201
Your first targets were the men
who destroyed your family.

15:03.269 --> 15:05.003
You became a contract killer.

15:05.004 --> 15:07.504
You showed no pity.

15:07.573 --> 15:10.073
Your first targets
were the men...

15:10.109 --> 15:13.044
Julia will eat well.

15:13.545 --> 15:14.545
Live well.

15:14.546 --> 15:17.447
Julia is who you are.

15:17.917 --> 15:21.216
This went on over six months.

15:21.287 --> 15:24.051
It was about that time that Oleg
felt he'd had a breakthrough.

15:24.123 --> 15:27.251
That his therapy
was starting to work.

15:30.796 --> 15:32.130
Julia?

15:32.131 --> 15:33.131
Yes?

15:33.132 --> 15:35.632
Lunch.

15:38.304 --> 15:41.205
Once Oleg believed
that you were ready,

15:41.273 --> 15:43.901
they gave you a test

15:43.976 --> 15:46.476
to prove to them
that you were a believer.

15:46.512 --> 15:48.780
That you were, in fact,
another woman.

15:48.781 --> 15:52.080
May I present Julia Thorne?

15:58.190 --> 15:59.991
Welcome, Miss Thorne.

15:59.992 --> 16:04.122
The work you'll be doing for us
requires a certain commitment.

16:04.196 --> 16:05.530
Of course.

16:05.531 --> 16:08.432
Who this man is
is not important.

16:08.500 --> 16:11.560
What is important
is the knife on the table.

16:11.637 --> 16:12.804
Use it.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.405
Kill this unimportant man.

16:14.406 --> 16:16.906
No! No!

16:17.176 --> 16:19.510
No! No!

16:19.511 --> 16:22.810
No! No!

16:22.881 --> 16:25.381
No! No!
Please don't!

16:51.510 --> 16:53.378
Who was he?

16:53.379 --> 16:55.879
We don't know.

16:56.548 --> 16:59.048
So I was programmed.

16:59.051 --> 17:00.051
No.

17:00.052 --> 17:02.552
Not by The Covenant.

17:06.925 --> 17:09.394
Wait.
Kendall, I don't understand.

17:09.395 --> 17:10.461
I murdered that man.

17:10.462 --> 17:13.056
What do you mean I wasn't
programmed by The Covenant?

17:13.132 --> 17:15.433
When you were young,
your father subjected you

17:15.434 --> 17:17.468
to the CIA's
experimental program

17:17.469 --> 17:19.969
to train and prepare children
for intelligence work.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.204
Project: Christmas.

17:21.205 --> 17:23.141
Among other things,
that program contained

17:23.142 --> 17:25.576
a fail-safe to protect
its subjects from being turned.

17:25.577 --> 17:27.811
Jack hardwired you to stand up

17:27.813 --> 17:30.577
to some pretty intense
efforts at brainwashing.

17:32.117 --> 17:34.617
I traded his life for mine.

17:34.620 --> 17:36.087
That man, whoever he was,

17:36.088 --> 17:38.322
was taken, brought
into a Covenant facility.

17:38.323 --> 17:40.024
He was dead
no matter what you did,

17:40.025 --> 17:42.160
and you must have known that.

17:42.161 --> 17:43.961
It doesn't lessen what I did.

17:43.962 --> 17:46.863
But if you hadn't convinced them
you'd been programmed,

17:46.932 --> 17:48.533
you would have both been killed.

17:48.534 --> 17:51.034
You could never
have contacted me.

17:56.108 --> 17:58.608
I want to go home.

17:58.844 --> 18:00.044
I want to see my dad.

18:00.045 --> 18:03.378
Your father can't be contacted.
He's under deep cover.

18:03.449 --> 18:06.111
And as it is, you have
no home to return to.

18:06.185 --> 18:07.218
Let me be clear.

18:07.219 --> 18:09.881
You return home,
you're putting in jeopardy

18:09.955 --> 18:12.356
the lives of the people
you claim to love.

18:12.357 --> 18:13.991
You're just trying to scare me.

18:13.992 --> 18:15.460
Look at your friend Will.

18:15.461 --> 18:18.453
The Covenant left
the son of a bitch for dead.

18:18.530 --> 18:19.564
Listen to me.

18:19.565 --> 18:21.566
If what intel
we have on The Covenant

18:21.567 --> 18:23.768
is anywhere near accurate,
they have the potential

18:23.769 --> 18:26.170
to be far more deadly
than The Alliance ever was,

18:26.171 --> 18:29.663
which is why it is imperative
you continue as Julia Thorne.

18:29.741 --> 18:31.776
The Covenant believes
they have you programmed.

18:31.777 --> 18:34.078
If you think I'm going back,
you're insane.

18:34.079 --> 18:36.579
If you don't,
they're gonna come after you.

18:36.715 --> 18:39.215
After your friends, your family.

18:39.384 --> 18:41.884
After Vaughn.

18:43.755 --> 18:46.157
I have to see him.

18:46.158 --> 18:48.658
Sydney, you've been gone
nine months.

18:57.503 --> 18:59.570
He loves me.

18:59.571 --> 19:02.071
Nine months is nothing.

19:05.077 --> 19:07.577
So I let you go.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.314
And you went home.

19:28.133 --> 19:30.034
As hard as it was
to see them together,

19:30.035 --> 19:32.535
you couldn't confront Vaughn.

19:32.638 --> 19:35.106
You realized your presence
was a danger to him,

19:35.107 --> 19:38.099
so you did the only thing
you could.

19:43.715 --> 19:46.083
This is Kendall.

19:46.084 --> 19:48.584
I'll do whatever you want.

19:51.390 --> 19:54.689
And that's how we started
working together.

19:55.427 --> 19:57.927
So I became Julia.

19:58.263 --> 20:00.763
Yes, you did.

20:01.266 --> 20:06.465
<i># Funny how I blind myself #</i>

20:06.538 --> 20:09.666
<i># I never knew #</i>

20:16.114 --> 20:21.677
<i># If I was sometimes
played upon #</i>

20:21.753 --> 20:25.780
<i># Afraid to lose #</i>

20:29.094 --> 20:32.427
<i># Oh, I'd tell myself #</i>

20:32.497 --> 20:35.762
<i># Oh, it's my life #</i>

20:35.834 --> 20:37.001
<i># It never ends #</i>

20:37.002 --> 20:42.941
They sent you to Algeria,
where you met with this man.

20:43.809 --> 20:46.077
Simon Walker.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.211
He was a thief.

20:47.212 --> 20:49.280
You were introduced
as a contract killer.

20:49.281 --> 20:51.616
You started working together
for The Covenant.

20:51.617 --> 20:54.415
The mission was simple. They
wanted you to find the cube.

20:56.021 --> 20:58.922
During your time with Simon,
you pursued a variety of leads,

20:58.991 --> 21:00.524
all the while
keeping me informed

21:00.525 --> 21:03.585
by passing on the intel
to one of our operatives.

21:03.662 --> 21:06.893
You informed me that Simon
had found Andrian Lazarey.

21:06.965 --> 21:09.525
A Russian diplomat,
member of the Romanov family,

21:09.601 --> 21:12.263
who, like Sloane, was devoted
to studying Rambaldi.

21:13.171 --> 21:15.799
You believed Lazarey would know
where to find the cube.

21:15.874 --> 21:17.341
It was a crucial acquisition,

21:17.342 --> 21:20.243
because it contained
the DNA of Rambaldi himself.

21:20.312 --> 21:22.113
You told me
The Covenant wanted you

21:22.114 --> 21:24.614
to get the information
from him and then kill him.

21:24.683 --> 21:27.183
It turns out you saved his life.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.220
You went to Lazarey

21:29.221 --> 21:31.522
the night before you were
supposed to kill him.

21:31.523 --> 21:33.124
He's a reasonable man.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.753
The two of you struck a deal.

21:37.462 --> 21:40.795
I'll make this as simple
as possible, Mr. Lazarey.

21:40.866 --> 21:44.768
Unless you do exactly as I say,

21:44.836 --> 21:47.566
by this time tomorrow night,
you will be dead.

21:47.639 --> 21:50.802
So that's why
I faked Lazarey's death.

21:54.446 --> 21:55.846
So the videotape.

21:55.847 --> 21:57.882
We presumed there'd be
surveillance cameras.

21:57.883 --> 21:59.317
The murder had to look real.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.985
The paramedics
were CIA operatives

22:00.986 --> 22:02.420
working under my orders.

22:02.421 --> 22:04.822
The Kremlin carried out
a thorough investigation,

22:04.823 --> 22:06.524
and they believed,
as did The Covenant,

22:06.525 --> 22:09.323
that Andrian Lazarey
was assassinated.

22:09.394 --> 22:11.495
Assuming everything
you're telling me is true,

22:11.496 --> 22:13.698
Mr. Kendall,
what am I doing here?

22:13.699 --> 22:16.463
Why are you telling me this now?
And where are we going?

22:16.535 --> 22:18.736
We're going to my facility
in Nevada.

22:18.737 --> 22:20.171
Project: Black Hole.

22:20.172 --> 22:23.005
Four years ago when I was
called in to question you,

22:23.075 --> 22:25.575
I was never FBI.

22:25.644 --> 22:28.670
I was Special Research
overseeing the project.

22:28.747 --> 22:30.948
I've never heard
of Project: Black Hole.

22:30.949 --> 22:33.449
Thank you.

22:34.619 --> 22:37.816
This is everything
the government has collected

22:37.889 --> 22:41.325
on or about Milo Rambaldi
since the 1940s.

22:41.393 --> 22:44.624
A quarter of the artifacts
we have were collected by you.

22:44.696 --> 22:47.358
You're actually something
of a celebrity in-house.

22:47.432 --> 22:50.265
Which is also
why The Covenant needed you.

22:50.335 --> 22:52.336
They believe
Rambaldi's prophecies.

22:52.337 --> 22:54.505
They believe a lot of things,

22:54.506 --> 22:57.407
including the idea
that you are...

23:00.212 --> 23:02.712
The Chosen One.

23:03.882 --> 23:09.149
My mother said that
the night I disappeared.

23:13.425 --> 23:15.925
Get off the ledge!

23:17.596 --> 23:19.397
I'll tell you
what you need to know.

23:19.398 --> 23:20.831
Get off the ledge now.

23:20.832 --> 23:24.632
It's you in the prophecy,
Sydney, not me.

23:25.570 --> 23:28.266
Four months ago, you asked me
not to tell you this.

23:28.340 --> 23:30.968
I honored that request
as long as possible.

23:31.042 --> 23:34.034
Trust me. When I finish
the story, you will understand.

23:34.112 --> 23:35.813
The Covenant had you.

23:35.814 --> 23:37.014
If they could get the cube,

23:37.015 --> 23:40.280
they'd have everything
to fulfill Rambaldi's prophecy.

23:40.352 --> 23:42.686
You continued to feed
The Covenant false leads.

23:42.687 --> 23:46.623
In truth, you and Lazarey
were working for the CIA

23:46.691 --> 23:48.526
trying to find that cube.

23:48.527 --> 23:51.826
And it took you nine months,
but you found it.

23:52.197 --> 23:54.697
Where was it?

23:56.868 --> 23:58.903
Nothing's ever easy, is it?

23:58.904 --> 24:03.500
It was in the Fish River Gorge
in Namibia.

24:18.123 --> 24:20.990
For 500 years,
the key to Rambaldi's prophecy

24:21.059 --> 24:24.119
lay buried in the depths
of this cave.

24:28.633 --> 24:32.933
To Rambaldi's followers,
this was the Holy Grail.

24:46.084 --> 24:48.152
A mile-long trek brought you

24:48.153 --> 24:51.520
to an elaborate vault
that housed the cube.

24:59.931 --> 25:02.695
Lazarey had devoted
30 years of his life

25:02.767 --> 25:05.135
to acquiring
the 12 keys to the vault,

25:05.136 --> 25:09.266
the last of which he found only
two weeks before your journey.

25:12.611 --> 25:14.211
Each one had a name on it

25:14.212 --> 25:17.648
that corresponded
to a keyhole in the wall.

25:37.135 --> 25:39.169
This lock won't stay open.

25:39.170 --> 25:41.695
I need to hold the key in place.

25:53.518 --> 25:56.018
Uhh!

25:56.421 --> 25:57.755
Lazarey was trapped,

25:57.756 --> 26:00.418
and the cave began
to collapse around you.

26:02.193 --> 26:04.693
Here, bite down on this.

26:05.697 --> 26:09.064
There was only one way
you could both get out alive.

26:22.113 --> 26:24.638
So you got the cube,
and you got Lazarey out.

26:24.716 --> 26:26.584
Come on, you've got to run.
Let's go.

26:26.585 --> 26:27.685
Let's go.

26:27.686 --> 26:30.186
Come on, keep going.

26:31.856 --> 26:33.223
Our agreement with Lazarey

26:33.224 --> 26:35.326
was that after he helped
tracked down the cube,

26:35.327 --> 26:38.626
we would let him
disappear untraced.

26:38.697 --> 26:42.098
After you let him go, you were
supposed to deliver me the cube.

26:42.167 --> 26:43.634
But I didn't show up.

26:43.635 --> 26:46.135
No, you didn't.

26:48.239 --> 26:50.739
Instead I got this.

26:52.410 --> 26:55.345
Do you want to know
what happened to your memory?

27:08.660 --> 27:11.390
You might want
to sit down for this.

27:23.008 --> 27:25.508
Kendall.

27:26.544 --> 27:29.044
I'm sorry.

27:29.214 --> 27:31.739
I know you were expecting
the cube with the DNA.

27:31.816 --> 27:34.316
Instead you get this.

27:35.086 --> 27:37.586
You've been great to me.

27:37.856 --> 27:41.622
A real friend,
and I am grateful for that.

27:42.661 --> 27:46.654
But I can't go along with it.

27:47.132 --> 27:49.632
The plan we had.

27:53.238 --> 27:55.738
You know what this is about.

27:56.374 --> 27:58.075
And I'm hoping
you can understand.

27:58.076 --> 27:59.677
What am I talking about?

27:59.678 --> 28:01.779
So I'm taking care of it myself.

28:01.780 --> 28:02.780
The DNA.

28:02.781 --> 28:05.978
Even if it's with the CIA,
it'll never be safe, not really.

28:06.051 --> 28:07.117
I've seen too much.

28:07.118 --> 28:09.386
Everything gets stolen.

28:09.387 --> 28:10.988
Everything.

28:10.989 --> 28:14.083
So I've got a plan.

28:14.959 --> 28:17.723
I found someone,
someone who can help me.

28:18.196 --> 28:21.757
A man who has done
advanced research

28:21.833 --> 28:25.929
on how the brain stores
short- and long-term memory.

28:28.239 --> 28:32.107
I'm not gonna tell you specifics
of what I'm doing with the DNA.

28:33.878 --> 28:36.438
In fact, I don't want
to know them myself.

28:38.249 --> 28:42.447
Which is why I'm gonna try
and have my memories...

28:43.955 --> 28:46.455
...erased.

28:48.660 --> 28:50.461
To keep The Covenant
from ever doing

28:50.462 --> 28:53.397
what they want with
Rambaldi's DNA, I'm gonna have

28:53.465 --> 28:56.400
everything that's happened
in the past two years removed.

28:58.937 --> 29:01.437
If this doesn't work.

29:02.774 --> 29:05.368
I mean, if this kills me...

29:07.045 --> 29:09.545
...better I did it
than The Covenant.

29:11.049 --> 29:16.885
But if it works, if I come back
and I don't remember,

29:16.955 --> 29:19.455
do me a favor.

29:22.694 --> 29:25.288
Don't ever tell me
about what I've been through.

29:37.742 --> 29:40.242
Why are you doing this?

29:42.647 --> 29:45.147
Telling me all this?

29:45.383 --> 29:48.318
In his prophecy, Rambaldi
spoke of a second coming.

29:48.386 --> 29:50.120
Those freaks want to clone him.

29:50.121 --> 29:52.919
No. What The Covenant believes
is that Rambaldi's work

29:52.991 --> 29:55.721
was destined to continue
beyond his time.

29:56.661 --> 29:59.960
That he was due a second coming
by way of a child.

30:05.136 --> 30:08.503
"This woman here depicted
will possess unseen marks.

30:08.573 --> 30:12.441
Signs that she will be the one
to bring forth my works. "

30:14.813 --> 30:19.307
"She will render the greatest
power unto utter desolation. "

30:19.684 --> 30:22.184
The fanatical point of view
believes Rambaldi's DNA

30:22.187 --> 30:23.620
can be transformed.

30:23.621 --> 30:26.121
Used to fertilize the egg
of a surrogate mother.

30:26.124 --> 30:31.027
Someone referred to in his
prophecy as "The Chosen One. "

30:47.879 --> 30:50.379
That's why they cut me open.

30:50.582 --> 30:51.782
Yes.

30:51.783 --> 30:56.686
So they could extract my eggs.

30:59.324 --> 31:02.157
And that's why you went
to such extraordinary lengths.

31:02.227 --> 31:05.287
Because his child
would also be yours.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.999
Sydney, that's why
I came to you.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.868
Not protocol.
There was no official order.

31:10.869 --> 31:14.134
Sydney, a couple years ago,
I got to know you a little bit.

31:14.205 --> 31:16.473
What I believed was,
despite your protests,

31:16.474 --> 31:18.974
you would want to know
about this.

31:19.811 --> 31:22.311
The Covenant has it all now.

31:23.314 --> 31:25.942
I got this video two days before
you turned up in Hong Kong.

31:26.017 --> 31:28.611
And despite my being pissed off,
I respected your choice.

31:28.686 --> 31:29.753
I opted to let it go.

31:29.754 --> 31:33.417
But here we are 4 months later,
and you went for the cube.

31:33.491 --> 31:37.359
Why, when you nearly killed
yourself trying to hide it?

31:40.598 --> 31:42.432
Three weeks ago,
Sloane gave me a package

31:42.433 --> 31:45.197
that I had sent to him
in the mail.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.404
It was addressed
in my handwriting.

31:48.406 --> 31:51.603
Inside was a key and an address
to an apartment in Rome

31:51.676 --> 31:53.744
that I had rented
as Julia Thorne.

31:53.745 --> 31:56.245
I found a code there.

31:56.748 --> 32:00.741
Coordinates that led me
to a box buried in the sand.

32:00.818 --> 32:01.985
It was a hand.

32:01.986 --> 32:06.252
It was Lazarey's hand,
which led me to Lazarey.

32:07.492 --> 32:09.992
To the cube.

32:11.095 --> 32:13.363
When The Covenant learned
I'd hidden the cube,

32:13.364 --> 32:14.698
they kept looking.

32:14.699 --> 32:15.999
Eventually, they found it.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.401
They found the cave.

32:17.402 --> 32:19.202
Lazarey's hand.

32:19.203 --> 32:21.338
So they forged my handwriting.

32:21.339 --> 32:23.839
They planted the code.

32:24.208 --> 32:27.609
They wanted me to find
the hand in the desert.

32:27.679 --> 32:28.979
They planted it there.

32:28.980 --> 32:32.711
They wanted me to ask these
questions to smoke out Lazarey.

32:32.784 --> 32:35.284
They tricked me into leading
them back to the cube.

32:35.353 --> 32:36.720
Why didn't you destroy it?

32:36.721 --> 32:39.519
I don't know. And why did I
just leave it at the hotel?

32:42.760 --> 32:44.728
Maybe there was another step.

32:44.729 --> 32:47.229
Maybe there was
someone else involved.

32:48.933 --> 32:51.993
When we get back, I want you
to look at all the artifacts.

32:52.070 --> 32:53.136
I need a phone.

32:53.137 --> 32:54.404
I need a phone right now.

32:58.309 --> 32:59.309
This is Marshall.

32:59.310 --> 33:02.108
Marshall, I need you to
listen to me very carefully.

33:02.180 --> 33:04.842
You said that the jerks
were taking it away.

33:04.916 --> 33:06.917
That you should put
a tracer on it and track it

33:06.918 --> 33:09.418
because you can imagine
how cool it must be.

33:09.420 --> 33:11.021
I need you to tell me the truth.

33:11.022 --> 33:13.522
Did you put a tracer
on that cube?

33:13.524 --> 33:17.221
If you did, and if you're afraid
you're gonna get disciplined,

33:17.295 --> 33:19.563
I swear to God
you're gonna be okay.

33:19.564 --> 33:21.832
I'm sorry.
I didn't put a tracer on it.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.100
I know you.

33:23.101 --> 33:26.400
No one is more curious
about technology than you.

33:26.938 --> 33:28.739
I need to find that cube!

33:28.740 --> 33:32.198
I didn't put a tracer on it.
I swear to you I didn't, okay?

33:32.944 --> 33:35.444
Okay.

33:35.446 --> 33:37.614
I put a tracer on it,
but you cannot tell.

33:37.615 --> 33:39.583
If they find out,
they will fire me.

33:39.584 --> 33:41.752
I cannot be fired.
I'm about to have a baby.

33:41.753 --> 33:42.919
Marshall, I love you.

33:42.920 --> 33:44.154
I love you, too, Syd.

33:44.155 --> 33:46.123
But seriously,
you can't tell anyone.

33:46.124 --> 33:47.624
Can you locate the cube?

33:47.625 --> 33:49.793
Well, not exactly,
but I can narrow it down

33:49.794 --> 33:51.094
to a 10-yard radius.

33:51.095 --> 33:53.595
Marshall,
that's called locating it.

33:53.631 --> 33:56.131
Where is it?

34:24.495 --> 34:25.762
Here's the big picture.

34:25.763 --> 34:26.763
At 2100 hours,

34:26.764 --> 34:29.232
you'll be dropped from
10,000 feet over Patagonia.

34:29.233 --> 34:31.668
You'll hit the ground a
quarter-mile from the building.

34:31.668 --> 34:33.170
We have minimal intelligence
on this,

34:33.170 --> 34:36.402
but we believe the fertilization
will happen tonight.

34:37.475 --> 34:39.509
Chopper will be here
in two minutes.

34:39.510 --> 34:41.277
We'll review the operation
en route.

34:41.279 --> 34:42.779
This is Kendall.

34:42.780 --> 34:44.714
Where is he?

34:44.715 --> 34:47.215
Tell him I'm waiting.

34:57.428 --> 34:59.262
What's going on with you two?

34:59.263 --> 35:00.931
Nothing.

35:00.932 --> 35:03.400
Come on, we got to prep.

35:03.401 --> 35:05.202
Dixon.

35:05.203 --> 35:07.703
What are you doing?

35:15.980 --> 35:18.448
The day you showed up in Rome,
when you called in,

35:18.449 --> 35:20.949
they put you through to Kendall.

35:21.686 --> 35:25.383
I was there that day
in the office.

35:25.456 --> 35:30.086
When he hung up,
he told me that it was you.

35:32.029 --> 35:34.197
I've known the truth
about what happened,

35:34.198 --> 35:36.698
and I was ordered
to say nothing.

35:38.669 --> 35:41.763
Dixon, we've been
working together for months.

35:42.507 --> 35:45.007
It's not easy, is it?

35:45.743 --> 35:49.304
Keeping the truth
from someone you love?

35:50.848 --> 35:55.512
Now I have an idea what
it was like for you at SD-6.

36:00.158 --> 36:01.825
You're coming with us.

36:01.826 --> 36:04.060
Of course I am.

36:04.061 --> 36:06.561
It's personal for me, too.

36:26.450 --> 36:28.950
Let's do it!

36:53.077 --> 36:55.577
Let's move.

38:14.358 --> 38:16.858
Okay.

39:11.982 --> 39:14.951
Kendall wants all of this
brought back for analysis.

39:20.057 --> 39:22.557
Do your thing.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.916
Julia?

40:29.126 --> 40:31.626
They have my father.

40:32.797 --> 40:35.297
Take care of it.

40:48.512 --> 40:51.012
Mr. Lazarey.

40:57.154 --> 41:02.057
You know about the passenger?

41:03.160 --> 41:05.660
Excuse me?

41:06.263 --> 41:08.763
The passenger.

41:15.039 --> 41:18.600
We'll have time to talk
at the hospital.

41:54.512 --> 41:55.979
Get him inside!

41:55.980 --> 41:57.013
Move!

41:57.014 --> 41:59.514
Shooter! Shooter!

42:05.556 --> 42:07.423
Dixon,
I'm at the naval hospital.

42:07.424 --> 42:09.058
There's a sniper.
Lazarey's been shot!

42:09.059 --> 42:11.559
He's dead.
Get me a team out here now!

42:23.774 --> 42:26.274
The matter's taken care of.

42:26.744 --> 42:28.511
Yes, sir.

42:28.512 --> 42:31.012
I will.
