WEBVTT

00:04.627 --> 00:06.686
I love you...

00:06.697 --> 00:09.052
I loved you even
before I met you.

00:15.737 --> 00:18.262
You marry him,
it'll destroy you.

00:24.137 --> 00:25.843
I've made my choice.

00:25.847 --> 00:27.075
Freya, listen to me.

00:27.077 --> 00:29.068
Is everything okay, freya?

00:29.077 --> 00:31.580
Killian was just leaving.

00:32.917 --> 00:35.385
Good-bye.

01:11.057 --> 01:13.525
How is it possible
that I'm the key?

01:13.527 --> 01:16.223
Uh, I don't know how and I don't
know why, but I know I'm right.

01:16.227 --> 01:18.263
You are "a parching imbued."

01:18.267 --> 01:19.689
We can prove it.

01:19.697 --> 01:21.085
By opening the door.

01:21.097 --> 01:23.634
I can't help you, mike.

01:23.637 --> 01:24.865
Yes, you can.

01:24.867 --> 01:26.960
Okay, fine, I won't.

01:26.977 --> 01:29.025
I'll show you my research.
You'll see that I'm right.

01:29.037 --> 01:31.164
I don't care if you're right.

01:32.577 --> 01:34.442
Aren't you curious
about who you are?

01:34.447 --> 01:35.914
And where you came from?

01:35.917 --> 01:38.715
Let's go to the portal.

01:38.717 --> 01:40.241
Let's see if you can open it.

01:40.247 --> 01:41.475
We can make history.

01:58.567 --> 02:00.296
So, what did you find?

02:00.307 --> 02:02.901
You know how we cleared the
portal of the ramus mortium?

02:02.907 --> 02:04.397
Why? Is it back?

02:04.407 --> 02:05.943
Nope, it's worse.

02:05.947 --> 02:07.938
Now there's
argenteum leaking out.

02:07.947 --> 02:09.664
All on its own?
Yeah.

02:09.676 --> 02:12.145
That means someone's
trying to create a rift

02:12.147 --> 02:13.284
Between the two worlds.

02:13.287 --> 02:14.640
So you think that the shifter's

02:14.657 --> 02:15.806
Trying to open the portal?

02:15.817 --> 02:18.615
Definitely.
Hang on a second...

02:18.627 --> 02:20.675
what if it's not just
about opening the portal?

02:20.697 --> 02:22.255
What if it's about
creating the rift

02:22.257 --> 02:24.350
In order to obtain
the argenteum?

02:24.367 --> 02:26.756
That is one of the few poisons
that would actually kill you.

02:26.767 --> 02:28.621
Has it occurred to either
of you that the portal is

02:28.637 --> 02:31.356
Under the house where freya's
getting married tomorrow?

02:32.707 --> 02:35.164
Well, it has come up, yeah.

02:35.177 --> 02:38.135
So, what if the gardines are
the ones that are after you?

02:38.147 --> 02:40.536
No, we actually tested
both penelope and dash.

02:40.547 --> 02:41.946
They both came back mortal.

02:41.947 --> 02:44.438
Okay, so what are
we gonna do?

02:44.447 --> 02:45.709
I'm sorry, "we"?

02:45.717 --> 02:46.809
Yeah, I'm not gonna

02:46.817 --> 02:48.011
Let you face this alone.

02:52.057 --> 02:54.184
You know, frankly
I'm glad you're both here.

02:54.197 --> 02:56.950
I could use the help.

03:08.737 --> 03:11.205
Tenebris.

03:15.017 --> 03:17.474
Magicae.

03:21.587 --> 03:25.148
Infirmarent.

03:25.157 --> 03:28.081
Hostem!

04:57.077 --> 05:00.683
Oh, freya.

05:00.687 --> 05:03.485
You look so...

05:03.487 --> 05:05.785
Do you like the veil?

05:05.787 --> 05:07.823
It's gorgeous.

05:07.827 --> 05:10.148
You look gorgeous and a bit...

05:10.157 --> 05:11.749
Mom?

05:11.767 --> 05:13.792
Just don't cry.
Save it for the wedding.

05:13.797 --> 05:15.992
Or at least the wedding dress.

05:15.997 --> 05:18.989
I'm sorry.

05:20.007 --> 05:20.996
Oh, no!

05:21.007 --> 05:22.872
Isn't that bad luck?

05:22.877 --> 05:26.768
Life is not about good luck

05:26.777 --> 05:28.836
Or bad luck.

05:28.847 --> 05:30.474
It is about what you do

05:30.477 --> 05:32.672
With what you're given.

05:32.687 --> 05:34.143
So...

05:34.147 --> 05:36.945
Not to worry.

05:36.957 --> 05:39.380
Okay.

05:50.897 --> 05:53.195
Did you see? It's raining.

05:53.207 --> 05:55.300
So? Rain's good luck
for a wedding.

05:55.307 --> 05:56.672
No, it's not!

05:56.677 --> 05:57.666
That's just something
mortals say

05:57.677 --> 05:58.974
To make themselves feel better.

05:58.977 --> 06:00.376
We both know it's an omen.

06:00.377 --> 06:02.015
It's weather, wendy.

06:02.017 --> 06:03.746
It happens.

06:03.747 --> 06:04.736
What are you doing?

06:04.747 --> 06:06.476
Nothing.

06:06.487 --> 06:08.341
Freya's veil ripped.

06:08.357 --> 06:09.551
What? Are you kidding me?

06:09.557 --> 06:10.808
Another sign?

06:10.827 --> 06:12.920
It's a sign
she has a clumsy mother.

06:20.337 --> 06:22.828
Three harbingers
of doom, joanna?

06:22.837 --> 06:25.192
You can't say this
is a coincidence.

06:25.207 --> 06:28.096
Okay, wendy, you're right.
It's not.

06:28.107 --> 06:30.905
The shifter's sending
dark energy to weaken us.

06:30.907 --> 06:32.067
That's why the veil ripped.

06:32.077 --> 06:33.339
That's where the rain came from.

06:33.347 --> 06:34.575
And that's why the dead crow.

06:34.577 --> 06:36.408
All part of the same spell.

06:41.457 --> 06:43.345
We have to cancel the wedding.

06:43.357 --> 06:45.917
I cannot do that to my daughter.

06:45.927 --> 06:49.351
Every life that freya has
lived has been cut short.

06:49.357 --> 06:51.587
She's never been married,
she's never had a child,

06:51.597 --> 06:52.916
Never grown old.

06:52.927 --> 06:54.258
I have to give her this day.

06:54.267 --> 06:55.928
She's waited too long for it.

06:55.937 --> 06:57.063
I want to give
her this day, too.

06:57.067 --> 06:58.557
But I want you to be safe.

06:58.567 --> 06:59.795
We can do both.

06:59.807 --> 07:02.526
We have to meet
the darkness with light.

07:02.537 --> 07:04.926
So, every omen
that comes our way,

07:04.947 --> 07:07.575
we counteract with
an equal and opposite spell.

07:07.577 --> 07:09.238
We can fix this.

07:09.247 --> 07:11.545
We have to fix this for freya.

08:47.347 --> 08:49.611
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

08:53.217 --> 08:55.082
How'd you get in my room?

08:55.087 --> 08:57.908
Give me back my maps.
I can't.

08:57.927 --> 08:59.724
You wouldn't even know about
the portal if it weren't for me.

08:59.727 --> 09:00.819
You owe me, ingrid.

09:00.827 --> 09:02.146
I don't owe you a thing.

09:02.157 --> 09:03.522
You don't care about me.

09:03.527 --> 09:04.687
You're doing this for yourself.

09:04.697 --> 09:06.995
I don't care what you are.

09:06.997 --> 09:08.464
I'm not afraid of you.

09:09.497 --> 09:10.486
You're not gonna hurt me.

09:10.507 --> 09:11.656
You're too sweet.

09:11.667 --> 09:12.895
I will do whatever it takes

09:12.907 --> 09:14.158
To open that door.

09:14.167 --> 09:15.236
Mike, you've lost it.

09:15.237 --> 09:16.568
You've turned into your father.

09:16.577 --> 09:17.532
My father was right!

09:17.537 --> 09:19.368
And so am I.

09:19.377 --> 09:21.345
And I'm not gonna stop
until I prove it.

09:21.347 --> 09:22.541
Corpus dolet!

09:25.087 --> 09:26.907
What are you doing to me?

09:29.617 --> 09:31.278
I'm not as sweet
as you think I am.

09:31.287 --> 09:33.118
And if I were you,
I'd get the hell out of town.

09:33.127 --> 09:34.446
You shouldn't mess
with me, mike.

09:34.457 --> 09:35.446
I'm a witch.

09:35.457 --> 09:38.324
Remember?

09:49.777 --> 09:51.426
It's my last day
in this house.

09:51.447 --> 09:52.869
Somebody better eat
breakfast with me.

09:52.877 --> 09:54.435
Oh, hey!

09:54.447 --> 09:56.301
Hi.
I thought you were mom.

09:56.317 --> 09:58.615
Or ingrid... Or wendy.

09:58.617 --> 10:00.938
Man, I used to be able to sense
who was entering a room

10:00.947 --> 10:02.039
Without even looking.

10:02.057 --> 10:03.877
Now I'm all normal.

10:03.887 --> 10:06.105
Don't worry...
powers or no powers,

10:06.127 --> 10:08.277
I don't think
you'll ever be normal.

10:08.297 --> 10:10.322
Thank you.

10:10.327 --> 10:11.589
Wait, are you leaving?

10:11.597 --> 10:13.258
I should get back to the city.

10:13.267 --> 10:15.223
Look, it was...

10:15.237 --> 10:18.286
So nice to meet you, freya.

10:18.307 --> 10:19.763
Again, I...

10:19.767 --> 10:22.133
I thought you were coming
to the wedding.

10:22.137 --> 10:24.503
Yeah, I don't want to...
I don't want to impose.

10:24.507 --> 10:26.896
Who else is gonna
walk me down the aisle?

10:26.907 --> 10:28.636
Really?

10:28.647 --> 10:31.343
well, yeah.
I don't think

10:31.347 --> 10:32.837
That you came back
into my life

10:32.847 --> 10:35.338
I think this is
supposed to be.

10:35.357 --> 10:38.451
My father is supposed
to walk me down the aisle.

10:38.457 --> 10:40.425
Only if
you want to.

10:40.427 --> 10:42.850
I would love to.

10:44.767 --> 10:47.065
If you're sure this wedding
is what you really want.

10:48.967 --> 10:49.956
Yeah, I am.

10:49.967 --> 10:51.764
I just...

10:51.767 --> 10:54.327
Things are
complicated.

10:54.337 --> 10:56.771
Yeah, I had a...
I had a feeling.

10:58.507 --> 11:00.145
Did mom tell you
about the tarot?

11:00.147 --> 11:02.775
She dealt it
for me,

11:02.777 --> 11:05.814
And I drew the emperor
and the trickster.

11:05.817 --> 11:07.910
And last night you
met the trickster.

11:09.117 --> 11:10.482
You sure about that?

11:10.487 --> 11:12.307
Yes, I am.

11:12.327 --> 11:14.045
Dash is the emperor.

11:14.057 --> 11:15.319
He's my soul mate.

11:15.327 --> 11:18.216
He's loving
and kind

11:18.227 --> 11:19.649
And selfless,
and he...

11:19.667 --> 11:21.988
Makes me feel safe.

11:21.997 --> 11:24.488
And killian,
he...

11:24.507 --> 11:26.463
Scares me
a little.

11:26.467 --> 11:27.695
He's trouble.

11:27.707 --> 11:29.527
You always
loved trouble.

11:29.537 --> 11:31.198
Yeah, well, I don't want
it to destroy me.

11:31.207 --> 11:34.301
You can't read into
the cards so literally.

11:34.307 --> 11:35.535
"destroy"...

11:35.547 --> 11:37.674
"destroy" can mean
a lot of things.

11:37.677 --> 11:39.008
None of 'em are good,

11:39.017 --> 11:40.882
whether it's literal
or a metaphor.

11:40.887 --> 11:42.707
You're right.

11:42.717 --> 11:44.981
I had to make
a choice,

11:44.987 --> 11:47.046
And I did.

11:47.057 --> 11:48.479
l-I choose dash.

11:48.497 --> 11:49.896
And there's
no part of you

11:49.897 --> 11:51.216
That's tempted
by killian?

11:51.227 --> 11:53.388
Yeah.
Of course.

11:53.397 --> 11:55.058
But that's what
the trickster does.

11:55.067 --> 11:56.728
He confuses people.

11:56.737 --> 11:58.159
Ingrid:
Hey.

11:58.167 --> 11:59.725
Oh. Hey, you're still here.

11:59.737 --> 12:01.602
Dad's walking me
down the aisle.

12:01.607 --> 12:03.700
Oh.
That makes sense.

12:03.707 --> 12:04.935
You've known him
for five minutes,

12:04.947 --> 12:06.266
So why
shouldn't he?

12:06.277 --> 12:07.938
I'm sorry,
whose wedding is this?

12:07.947 --> 12:09.198
I just don't
get it.

12:09.217 --> 12:11.208
I need to get
back to the city,

12:11.217 --> 12:12.878
Get my suit and
a few other things.

12:12.887 --> 12:14.115
I'll be back later.

12:14.117 --> 12:16.950
Bye.
Bye.

12:16.957 --> 12:19.050
Bye.

12:19.057 --> 12:21.025
I know you have made him out

12:21.027 --> 12:22.517
To be some monster in your head,

12:22.527 --> 12:23.755
But it's not true.

12:23.767 --> 12:25.758
He loves us.

12:25.767 --> 12:27.564
He sure has an odd
way of showing it.

12:27.567 --> 12:29.558
I know this
sounds nuts,

12:29.567 --> 12:31.785
But it's kind of nice
to have someone

12:31.807 --> 12:33.365
who knows the truth
about who we are.

12:33.367 --> 12:34.925
Who we can talk to

12:34.937 --> 12:36.598
About all the things
we have to hide

12:36.607 --> 12:38.268
From the rest
of the world.

12:38.277 --> 12:40.973
It means a lot to me
that he's here for this.

12:40.977 --> 12:42.899
I think it's
meant to be.

12:42.917 --> 12:45.465
Okay.

12:45.487 --> 12:46.977
If that's what
you believe.

12:46.987 --> 12:48.284
I want you to have

12:48.287 --> 12:50.107
Everything
you want today.

12:50.117 --> 12:51.277
Thank you.

12:51.287 --> 12:52.720
What's with
the blueprints?

12:54.127 --> 12:56.152
Oh. Um, that...
That's just some, uh,

12:56.157 --> 12:58.045
Research for
my dissertation.

12:58.067 --> 12:59.466
On the day of
my wedding?

12:59.467 --> 13:00.957
I'm done now.

13:00.967 --> 13:02.389
And I love you.

13:02.397 --> 13:04.934
And I am so crazy happy for you.

13:04.937 --> 13:07.155
And I can't believe
you're leaving me.

13:07.167 --> 13:09.601
I'm gonna be
a mile away.

13:09.607 --> 13:10.801
I know.

13:10.807 --> 13:12.001
But it won't
be the same.

13:12.007 --> 13:14.305
I will never
leave you.

13:14.307 --> 13:15.797
I can't,
we're too connected.

13:27.127 --> 13:29.175
I meet you, darkness,
with my light.

13:33.027 --> 13:34.995
Protecti sumus hodie

13:34.997 --> 13:36.885
Lumen de tenebrae.

13:49.547 --> 13:50.935
Hey.

13:50.947 --> 13:52.608
Did you see?

13:52.617 --> 13:53.982
The rain's
cleared up.

13:53.987 --> 13:55.807
I noticed that.
Was that you?

13:55.817 --> 13:58.513
No.
Maybe.

13:58.527 --> 14:00.825
I just thought you should
have sun on your big day.

14:00.827 --> 14:02.385
Thanks, mom.

14:03.727 --> 14:05.149
Hey, I asked victor

14:05.167 --> 14:06.623
To walk me down the aisle.

14:07.897 --> 14:09.694
You did?

14:09.697 --> 14:11.665
Yeah,
is that crazy?

14:11.667 --> 14:12.895
Am I crazy?

14:12.907 --> 14:15.626
Ingrid thinks
I'm crazy.

14:15.637 --> 14:18.731
I want you to make
your own choices in life,

14:18.747 --> 14:21.875
To honor
your wisdom,

14:21.877 --> 14:24.414
And to follow what
feels right to you.

14:24.417 --> 14:26.635
That's how I know
I've done my job.

14:26.647 --> 14:30.185
And I want you
to walk with me, too.

14:30.187 --> 14:32.485
It wouldn't feel right
without you.

14:34.827 --> 14:37.216
I would be
honored.

14:38.727 --> 14:40.319
Oh... I almost forgot.

14:44.237 --> 14:46.728
Oh, you got me
a present.

14:46.737 --> 14:48.227
It was on
the back steps.

14:48.237 --> 14:49.499
Killian left it.

14:49.507 --> 14:50.906
Is he still here?

14:50.907 --> 14:54.104
Uh, I didn't actually see him.

14:54.117 --> 14:55.766
How do you know it's from him?

14:55.777 --> 14:58.245
I did
a little spell.

14:58.247 --> 15:00.306
Can't be too safe.

15:08.557 --> 15:10.991
Oh, what
a lovely song.

15:12.127 --> 15:14.595
You okay?

15:16.897 --> 15:18.194
I'm fine.

15:22.607 --> 15:24.302
I've protected us
12 ways to Sunday.

15:24.307 --> 15:25.569
Ooh, sage.

15:25.577 --> 15:27.238
Good idea.

15:27.247 --> 15:29.602
I thought we should do
a blessing before the wedding.

15:29.617 --> 15:31.369
Okay. Nice.

15:32.487 --> 15:33.738
So...

15:33.747 --> 15:35.237
You and victor?

15:35.257 --> 15:37.714
There is no "me and victor."

15:37.727 --> 15:40.048
There's always been
a "you and victor."

15:40.057 --> 15:42.582
I can't go down that road again.

15:42.597 --> 15:43.825
Didn't you?

15:43.827 --> 15:45.920
Already?
Last night?

15:45.927 --> 15:47.315
How...

15:47.327 --> 15:48.919
How did you know?

15:48.937 --> 15:50.461
Cat ears.

15:50.467 --> 15:52.458
Excuse me.

15:53.507 --> 15:55.600
So... You
still love him?

15:55.607 --> 15:57.734
That's never been the problem.

15:59.177 --> 16:01.805
I miss him.

16:07.247 --> 16:10.307
Roger... I got your text.

16:10.317 --> 16:11.579
What's up?

16:11.587 --> 16:12.679
Hey.

16:14.127 --> 16:15.651
We're not supposed
to see other

16:15.657 --> 16:17.818
Before the wedding!
All right, I'm sorry.

16:17.827 --> 16:19.260
Look, I know you're
superstitious,

16:19.267 --> 16:21.315
But I wanted to give
you something.

16:21.327 --> 16:23.534
So you made roger
text me and tell me

16:23.537 --> 16:24.788
That is so...

16:24.797 --> 16:26.765
Smart?
Devious!

16:26.767 --> 16:27.995
Look, I knew you
wouldn't come

16:28.007 --> 16:29.599
Unless I tricked
you, but I...

16:29.607 --> 16:33.771
I think you'll be happy
when you see why.

16:38.147 --> 16:39.614
l-I thought you
could wear it today.

16:39.617 --> 16:42.006
It's-it's
something new.

16:42.017 --> 16:43.882
And something blue.

16:43.887 --> 16:46.651
Dash, this is
too much.

16:46.657 --> 16:48.477
This probably cost
more than my car.

16:48.497 --> 16:50.522
It's just the beginning.

16:50.527 --> 16:52.347
Look, l-I want
you to have

16:52.367 --> 16:54.289
The best of
everything, freya.

16:54.297 --> 16:57.357
That's what
you deserve.

16:57.367 --> 16:59.961
I'm just so glad
you're mine.

17:06.707 --> 17:07.799
You're back.

17:07.807 --> 17:10.070
Yeah, I travel fast.

17:10.077 --> 17:11.510
It's one of my gifts.

17:11.517 --> 17:12.836
Hey...

17:12.847 --> 17:15.406
Can I talk to you
about something?

17:15.416 --> 17:17.180
Yes. Of...

17:17.186 --> 17:19.178
Of course, ingrid.
I...

17:19.186 --> 17:20.915
I was hoping
we could talk.

17:20.926 --> 17:23.987
This is not
a father-daughter

17:25.666 --> 17:27.760
Okay.
What is it?

17:27.767 --> 17:30.691
I want to know
about asgard.

17:30.707 --> 17:32.060
I've asked

17:32.067 --> 17:34.206
Mom and wendy
1,000 times,

17:34.207 --> 17:36.528
And they never give me
a straight answer.

17:36.537 --> 17:38.368
Well, I'm not surprised
you're curious.

17:38.377 --> 17:39.867
You're a lot like me.

17:39.877 --> 17:42.539
I don't think
I'm anything like you.

17:42.547 --> 17:43.912
You're a scholar.

17:43.917 --> 17:44.941
So am I.

17:44.947 --> 17:46.665
You're tenacious.
So am I.

17:46.687 --> 17:47.745
You're driven to seek
answers and truth.

17:47.757 --> 17:50.009
So am I.

17:50.017 --> 17:51.314
We're the same.

17:55.587 --> 17:56.849
Okay.

17:56.857 --> 17:58.290
So, then...

17:58.297 --> 17:59.594
Tell me
the truth.

17:59.597 --> 18:01.588
What happened there?

18:01.597 --> 18:04.088
Why did we leave?

18:06.037 --> 18:07.925
There was a war,

18:07.937 --> 18:09.256
And we lost.

18:12.077 --> 18:13.738
If you could
open the door

18:13.747 --> 18:15.465
And go back,
would you?

18:15.477 --> 18:18.139
I'd be pretty scared
to open that door.

18:18.147 --> 18:19.637
Because there
are a lot of

18:19.647 --> 18:21.535
Evil people on
the other side.

18:21.547 --> 18:22.980
And they want
to kill us.

18:22.987 --> 18:24.978
And they're far more
powerful than we are,

18:24.987 --> 18:27.046
I'm sorry to say.

18:28.997 --> 18:30.248
But...?

18:32.927 --> 18:35.987
None of us
wanted to leave.

18:37.297 --> 18:40.232
And there are still
those we left behind...

18:40.237 --> 18:43.035
And I'd do just about
anything to see them again.

19:43.337 --> 19:44.793
Freya...

19:44.797 --> 19:47.163
I am so happy
for you.

19:47.167 --> 19:48.634
Wendy:
I'm so glad

19:48.637 --> 19:50.127
I made it back into your life

19:50.137 --> 19:51.536
In time to see this, freya.

19:51.537 --> 19:54.005
Oh, thanks, guys.

19:54.007 --> 19:56.168
So, I have my
something new and blue.

19:57.877 --> 19:59.139
Beautiful.

19:59.147 --> 20:00.409
Dash gave it to me.

20:00.417 --> 20:02.214
I feel strange
wearing it, though.

20:02.217 --> 20:03.707
I'm not used to so much luxury.

20:03.717 --> 20:05.150
I never thought
I was so fancy.

20:05.157 --> 20:06.681
Ingrid:
Um, have you seen

20:06.687 --> 20:09.076
Your engagement ring?
I know.

20:09.097 --> 20:11.053
I think it's really
starting to hit me that

20:11.057 --> 20:12.319
In just a few hours,

20:12.327 --> 20:13.555
I'm gonna be married.

20:13.567 --> 20:15.216
I'm gonna live
in this house...

20:15.237 --> 20:17.694
This gorgeous,
incredible house...

20:17.707 --> 20:19.231
With a gorgeous,
incredible man

20:19.237 --> 20:22.035
Who buys me blinding
diamonds and sapphires.

20:22.037 --> 20:23.527
Yeah, pretty sweet.

20:23.537 --> 20:25.528
I just don't really care
about any of that.

20:25.547 --> 20:28.243
I just want to start a life
with the man I love.

20:28.247 --> 20:31.045
You still need something
old and borrowed.

20:31.047 --> 20:32.344
We've got that covered.

20:38.957 --> 20:41.778
To remind myself that
I'm making the right choice.

20:41.797 --> 20:43.150
Thanks, mom.

20:46.267 --> 20:47.916
I love you.
I know.

20:47.937 --> 20:49.495
I love you
so much.

20:52.037 --> 20:54.926
All right, well,
I want to do a blessing

20:54.937 --> 20:57.030
For the wedding

20:57.037 --> 20:58.436
And for your marriage.

20:59.307 --> 21:00.797
May it be
a long

21:00.807 --> 21:03.298
And happy one.

21:12.117 --> 21:13.448
Benedicito.

21:14.997 --> 21:18.922
Benedicito.

21:18.927 --> 21:20.986
Benedicito.

21:29.777 --> 21:30.675
oh, no!

21:32.277 --> 21:33.505
I'll take these.

21:33.507 --> 21:34.667
Hello, ladies.

21:34.677 --> 21:36.565
It's okay. I can fix it.

21:36.577 --> 21:41.981
Oh, you look
breathtaking, freya.

21:41.987 --> 21:43.955
Oh, and your father was looking
for you.

21:43.957 --> 21:45.310
He's in the music room.

21:45.327 --> 21:47.818
See you in there.

21:47.827 --> 21:49.522
Sage burning.

21:51.167 --> 21:53.590
Okay, I'm not
gonna say it.

21:53.597 --> 21:55.121
A broken chain,
another bad omen?

21:55.127 --> 21:57.266
It's okay. We fight the
darkness with light.

21:57.267 --> 21:59.258
Please, just
help me fix it.

22:00.837 --> 22:03.169
We fight the darkness
with light.

22:09.347 --> 22:10.666
Hey.

22:13.617 --> 22:16.108
You look beautiful.

22:16.117 --> 22:18.085
Thank you.

22:21.487 --> 22:23.318
So, I know I might be
overstepping,

22:23.327 --> 22:26.216
And honestly I wasn't even sure
if I should bring this up.

22:26.227 --> 22:28.388
And I know today
is possibly the worst time

22:28.397 --> 22:30.024
To be telling
you this,

22:30.037 --> 22:33.291
But ultimately, I believe,
freya, that you have

22:33.307 --> 22:34.433
Know what?

22:35.307 --> 22:37.195
I want to show you
something.

22:44.717 --> 22:45.866
What's this?

22:45.887 --> 22:47.878
Do you recognize
any of this?

22:50.157 --> 22:53.024
It feels oddly familiar.

22:53.027 --> 22:54.824
Because it used to be yours.

22:56.397 --> 22:58.353
I know I said I hadn't seen you

22:58.357 --> 23:00.222
Since your mother
and I split up,

23:00.227 --> 23:01.694
But that's not exactly true.

23:01.697 --> 23:03.164
Our paths have crossed
more than once

23:03.167 --> 23:04.885
Throughout the centuries,
freya.

23:04.907 --> 23:07.432
But there was one time,
one time in particular

23:07.437 --> 23:09.064
That I thought
you should know about.

23:09.077 --> 23:10.260
Why?

23:10.277 --> 23:11.676
Because it might affect
what you decide

23:11.677 --> 23:13.440
To do with the rest
of your life.

23:17.347 --> 23:20.942
Penelope, why do you keep
this picture here?

23:20.957 --> 23:22.606
What do you mean?

23:22.617 --> 23:25.006
Well, doesn't it give you
the creeps?

23:26.727 --> 23:28.024
Not really.

23:28.027 --> 23:31.952
That man built this house.

23:31.967 --> 23:33.355
And I love this house.

23:33.367 --> 23:34.959
So I'm just paying
my respects.

23:34.967 --> 23:36.423
Of course.

23:36.437 --> 23:39.861
Must be hard to pay respects
to a murderous cult leader.

23:42.567 --> 23:45.798
And who did he murder exactly?

23:46.977 --> 23:49.537
l-I don't know, specifically.

23:49.547 --> 23:51.970
I just heard.

23:51.987 --> 23:53.875
That's funny,

23:53.887 --> 23:57.084
Because I swear I read somewhere

23:57.087 --> 23:59.806
That he was the one
that was murdered.

24:01.157 --> 24:04.285
Are you sure?
I thought he disappeared,

24:04.297 --> 24:06.219
And no one knew exactly
what became of him.

24:06.227 --> 24:08.787
Why don't we ask ingrid
what happened?

24:09.837 --> 24:11.930
Why?

24:11.937 --> 24:14.155
Because...

24:14.167 --> 24:17.261
She's a fair haven
history buff.

24:17.277 --> 24:19.472
Right.

24:19.477 --> 24:21.775
Here's to our families...

24:21.777 --> 24:23.369
Finally coming together.

24:29.757 --> 24:33.079
In 1906, I was living
in los angeles,

24:33.087 --> 24:35.180
And I tracked you down
in san francisco.

24:35.197 --> 24:37.848
You'd struck out
on your own,

24:37.857 --> 24:39.791
Which you do
from time to time.

24:39.797 --> 24:43.824
It's that restless
bohemian in you...

24:43.837 --> 24:45.429
Always longing for adventure...

24:45.437 --> 24:47.655
You were working in a tavern,
and your drinks

24:47.677 --> 24:49.668
Were a legend in the city.

24:49.677 --> 24:51.531
You were famous.

24:51.537 --> 24:54.802
Of course, you were secretly
mixing magic cocktails,

24:54.807 --> 24:56.445
But no one actually knew that.

24:56.447 --> 24:58.312
They just knew that
they couldn't get enough.

24:58.317 --> 25:01.844
You read fortunes on the side

25:01.847 --> 25:03.712
Just for fun,
but always for free.

25:03.717 --> 25:06.447
And you were happy, freya.

25:06.457 --> 25:08.982
Truly happy.

25:08.997 --> 25:11.215
Maybe the happiest
I've ever known you to be.

25:11.227 --> 25:12.785
You told me you were in love.

25:12.797 --> 25:14.389
I said, "that's nothing new. "

25:14.397 --> 25:16.115
But I realized pretty qulckly
that this time,

25:16.137 --> 25:18.332
It was different.

25:18.337 --> 25:20.601
You'd finally found
your other half.

25:31.917 --> 25:34.875
His name was henry.
He was a musician,

25:34.887 --> 25:36.684
And you were his muse.

25:36.687 --> 25:40.316
You llved in a tlny apartment
above the bar,

25:40.327 --> 25:43.546
He wrote his music,
and you made your drinks.

25:43.557 --> 25:46.253
And you were happy.

25:48.567 --> 25:51.855
Then you dled
in the great earthquake.

25:51.867 --> 25:54.927
Your funeral was the
last time I saw henry...

25:54.937 --> 25:57.326
Until yesterday

25:57.337 --> 25:59.828
When he was standing in
the front hall of your house.

26:08.447 --> 26:11.507
Joanna,
is everything okay?

26:11.527 --> 26:12.778
I think penelope's
the shifter.

26:12.787 --> 26:14.755
What?! Why would
you say that?

26:14.757 --> 26:17.453
I asked her about
archibald browning,

26:17.457 --> 26:19.448
And it was
very strange.

26:19.467 --> 26:23.460
I saw this... Flash
for a moment.

26:23.467 --> 26:25.458
Of anger.

26:25.467 --> 26:27.958
Um, she's connected
to him somehow.

26:27.977 --> 26:29.228
I can tell.

26:29.237 --> 26:31.205
Okay, let's go down
to the portal.

26:31.207 --> 26:32.868
Just make sure
nothing has changed.

26:32.877 --> 26:34.936
All right.
Gotta do it fast.

26:39.147 --> 26:40.910
I should've listened
to you, wendy,

26:40.917 --> 26:42.942
About the signs.

26:42.957 --> 26:47.644
It wasn't enough
to just counteract them.

26:47.657 --> 26:50.148
It didn't work.

26:50.157 --> 26:52.091
Wait... Something's wrong.

26:52.097 --> 26:53.416
I can feel it.

26:53.427 --> 26:56.760
You're right.
Something is very wrong.

27:13.587 --> 27:14.940
How does that feel?

27:14.957 --> 27:16.652
Wrists too tight?

27:16.657 --> 27:18.909
Fuge ad parietem!

27:18.927 --> 27:20.155
That's cute.

27:20.157 --> 27:22.284
I like your spirit!

27:22.297 --> 27:26.825
But, you see, I've drawn
a circle around this table.

27:26.827 --> 27:30.365
Red brick dust mixed
with blackthorn

27:30.367 --> 27:33.530
You are contained.

27:33.537 --> 27:35.129
That was a nice try, though.

27:35.137 --> 27:37.196
Who are you?

27:37.207 --> 27:38.834
Why are you doing this?

27:38.847 --> 27:40.326
I'm athena.

27:40.347 --> 27:41.700
But you died.

27:41.717 --> 27:44.709
Back in the early '60s, yeah.

27:44.717 --> 27:46.014
No,

27:46.017 --> 27:49.145
I wanted you to think
athena had died,

27:49.157 --> 27:51.307
So you wouldn't know
I was after you.

27:51.317 --> 27:53.148
But how did you find me?

27:53.157 --> 27:56.046
Oh, it wasn't easy.
It took decades.

27:56.057 --> 27:58.389
Your shroud was very effective;

27:58.397 --> 28:01.286
I couldn't even find this place
on the map...

28:01.297 --> 28:05.165
But I finally figured out a way
to break through your spell.

28:05.167 --> 28:08.705
And now, here we are.

28:11.537 --> 28:13.368
It couldn't have been.

28:13.377 --> 28:15.402
How is that possible?
Killian is mortal.

28:15.417 --> 28:18.170
There's a word in sanskrit...
"samsara"...

28:18.187 --> 28:19.814
The cycle of death
and rebirth.

28:19.817 --> 28:21.842
Well, you mean like
reincarnation?

28:21.847 --> 28:24.577
It's possible that you knew him
even before san francisco,

28:24.587 --> 28:26.805
That your souls met
again and again,

28:26.827 --> 28:28.749
Maybe even going back centuries.

28:28.757 --> 28:30.816
He might have chosen
to be reborn now

28:30.827 --> 28:32.419
Just so he could
find you.

28:32.427 --> 28:35.191
Or maybe he's the trickster!

28:35.197 --> 28:37.586
Disguising himself as someone
I used to love,

28:37.597 --> 28:40.327
Trying to destroy me,
just like the tarot card said.

28:40.337 --> 28:41.736
You're right, freya.

28:41.737 --> 28:44.228
I don't know that
it's really him.

28:45.207 --> 28:47.004
You said earlier
that you don't think

28:47.007 --> 28:50.113
It was an accident that I came
back into your life now.

28:50.117 --> 28:51.766
Maybe you're right.

28:51.777 --> 28:53.244
Maybe it's not an accident.

28:53.247 --> 28:55.044
Maybe I came back
to tell you this.

28:55.047 --> 28:56.605
I don't know.

28:56.617 --> 28:58.778
It's not for me
to say.

28:59.927 --> 29:02.646
I guess you have to look
into your heart and decide.

29:21.607 --> 29:23.040
I didn't mean
to kill him.

29:23.047 --> 29:27.438
You forget... I was there.

29:27.447 --> 29:28.778
Athena, please.

29:28.787 --> 29:31.210
I'm-I'm sorry.

29:31.217 --> 29:32.479
I know you loved
archibald,

29:32.487 --> 29:35.285
But you don't understand.

29:35.287 --> 29:37.323
You were a child. He was evil.

29:37.327 --> 29:39.454
He was my father!

29:39.467 --> 29:41.162
I loved him,

29:41.167 --> 29:43.158
And you murdered him!

29:43.167 --> 29:45.931
So you sent dash to spell freya.

29:45.937 --> 29:47.461
Oh, no, he doesn't
have powers.

29:47.467 --> 29:49.128
He's actually
in love with her.

29:49.137 --> 29:51.674
I didn't plan that part.
Very annoying.

29:51.677 --> 29:52.974
Then I realized

29:52.977 --> 29:55.172
It could be an advantage.

29:55.177 --> 29:57.145
Keep you all close.

29:57.147 --> 30:00.105
So dash isn't really your son?

30:00.117 --> 30:01.641
Oh, he is.

30:01.657 --> 30:04.512
I just borrowed his powers
when he was a baby.

30:04.517 --> 30:06.007
And killian's, too.

30:06.027 --> 30:09.918
I haven't told them,
but I will soon enough.

30:09.927 --> 30:11.622
I needed
to be stronger...

30:11.627 --> 30:13.288
Athena, please.

30:13.297 --> 30:15.356
...So that I'd be able
to find you

30:15.367 --> 30:18.029
And finally do
what needed to be done!

30:29.147 --> 30:30.796
Hey. It's almost time.

30:30.817 --> 30:32.808
Are you ready?

30:32.817 --> 30:34.535
Can you give me a minute?

30:34.547 --> 30:36.037
Okay.

31:29.537 --> 31:32.267
what are you doing here?!
I thought this was bad luck.

31:33.507 --> 31:35.304
Open your eyes.

31:39.417 --> 31:40.736
What-what's wrong?

31:43.287 --> 31:45.778
I can't do this.

31:46.557 --> 31:47.854
What do you mean?

31:47.857 --> 31:49.745
I can't marry you.

31:50.957 --> 31:53.084
No. No-no-no-no, freya,

31:53.097 --> 31:54.394
You're just freaking out.

31:54.397 --> 31:56.092
I mean, you're
having cold feet.

31:56.097 --> 31:57.758
It's not cold feet.

31:57.767 --> 32:00.429
I love you, but I can't do this.

32:10.817 --> 32:12.114
I'm so confused.

32:12.117 --> 32:14.881
I mean, you wanted this
just as much as I did.

32:14.887 --> 32:16.138
You're right,
I did.

32:16.157 --> 32:17.647
I wanted this
to be perfect.

32:17.657 --> 32:20.478
I wanted us to be perfect...

32:20.487 --> 32:23.422
So I pretended that we were.

32:23.427 --> 32:26.794
Because I had this idea
that this is who I should be,

32:26.797 --> 32:30.233
But I don't actually think
it's who I am.

32:30.237 --> 32:32.296
This is about killian,
isn't it?

32:33.837 --> 32:35.259
You're in love
with him.

32:35.267 --> 32:36.495
It's about me.

32:36.507 --> 32:39.271
I trusted you, freya.

32:39.277 --> 32:42.235
I gave you
everything.

32:42.247 --> 32:44.568
Just get out.

32:44.577 --> 32:46.340
I am so sorry.

32:46.347 --> 32:48.042
Get out!

32:49.457 --> 32:51.379
I don't ever want
to see you again.

33:25.517 --> 33:26.779
Have you
seen joanna?

33:26.787 --> 33:28.015
No.

33:28.027 --> 33:29.824
No, not for
a while.

33:29.827 --> 33:31.647
Keep an eye out.
I'll check

33:31.657 --> 33:33.295
But thank you
so much for coming.

33:33.297 --> 33:34.525
I'll see you
inside.

33:34.527 --> 33:36.222
I'm gonna go
check on my sister.

33:37.837 --> 33:39.725
You may be a witch,
but I will pull the trigger

33:39.737 --> 33:41.159
Faster than you
can do any magic.

33:41.167 --> 33:42.862
So don't even try.

33:42.877 --> 33:44.731
Shall we go?
Where?

33:44.737 --> 33:46.227
I think you know
exactly where.

33:48.177 --> 33:50.611
Penelope:
The argenteum has

33:52.477 --> 33:55.981
Now you can be killed
like the rest of us.

33:56.917 --> 33:58.350
Don't worry about

33:58.357 --> 34:00.075
Ingrid and freya.

34:00.087 --> 34:01.782
They're a part of
my family now.

34:04.197 --> 34:07.724
I will help them grieve
this senseless loss.

34:18.237 --> 34:19.773
Penelope:
How's it feel?

34:20.847 --> 34:22.074
Oh, look.

34:22.077 --> 34:23.498
It's the kitty.

34:29.717 --> 34:31.446
I'm sorry it had
to come to this.

34:31.456 --> 34:34.346
I didn't think I'd
have to convince you.

34:34.357 --> 34:36.621
I thought you'd
be more excited.

34:36.627 --> 34:39.289
But I'm going through
to the other side.

34:39.297 --> 34:40.786
This is it.

34:40.797 --> 34:42.219
Get in there!

34:42.237 --> 34:43.625
You really think
you could hurt me?

34:43.637 --> 34:45.161
All it would take is
for me to do one...

34:48.967 --> 34:50.434
Or I will
shoot you again.

34:50.437 --> 34:52.132
I know you can
be killed.

34:58.047 --> 34:59.275
Okay.

34:59.287 --> 35:00.811
You're the key.

35:00.817 --> 35:02.079
Open it up.

35:02.087 --> 35:04.612
I don't know how.

35:04.617 --> 35:06.608
So improvise!

35:06.627 --> 35:08.254
I don't know
if you've figured

35:08.257 --> 35:09.576
But I have
the power here.

35:09.597 --> 35:10.825
You do what I say!

35:10.827 --> 35:12.146
No!
Get over there!

35:19.667 --> 35:20.929
Nothing's happening.

35:20.937 --> 35:23.235
Then concentrate.

35:29.477 --> 35:31.342
I don't know what I should do.

35:34.187 --> 35:36.985
You're doing it already.

36:00.137 --> 36:01.365
Penelope...

36:02.617 --> 36:04.539
...Leave my sister alone.

36:13.627 --> 36:15.447
You are stronger
than I thought.

36:15.457 --> 36:17.118
But I still got
the poison inside you

36:17.127 --> 36:19.322
And you don't
have a chance.

36:19.327 --> 36:21.090
You are going
to die.

36:26.367 --> 36:28.426
Fight the darkness
with the light.

37:24.597 --> 37:26.952
Oh... Yes!

37:34.767 --> 37:36.701
I think
she's dead.

37:36.707 --> 37:39.130
I'd say so.

37:43.447 --> 37:44.869
I knew it, I knew it.

37:44.877 --> 37:46.413
I knew you were the key.
Use your other hand.

37:46.417 --> 37:47.611
Put your other hand on the wall!

37:47.617 --> 37:49.209
Touch the wall.

38:02.127 --> 38:03.856
Killian!

38:07.567 --> 38:08.864
What are you doing?

38:19.177 --> 38:21.213
How did you
do that?

39:28.887 --> 39:30.377
Why?

39:30.387 --> 39:32.878
It was payback for
killing archibald.

39:32.887 --> 39:34.548
She was his
daughter.

39:34.557 --> 39:36.252
What?

39:36.257 --> 39:38.316
Penelope
was athena?

39:39.557 --> 39:41.195
So dash and
killian...?

39:41.197 --> 39:42.664
Apparently,
they didn't know.

39:43.897 --> 39:45.228
Joanna...

39:45.237 --> 39:47.933
Did she poison you
with argenteum?

39:47.937 --> 39:49.905
Yeah.

39:49.907 --> 39:51.670
I might not
have long left.

39:51.677 --> 39:53.201
Oh, my god.

39:53.207 --> 39:54.936
Come here.

39:57.017 --> 40:00.214
what the hell
was that?

40:00.217 --> 40:01.935
The portal.

40:09.127 --> 40:10.446
Killian!

40:10.457 --> 40:13.290
Killian...

41:03.307 --> 41:06.037
Ingrid, no!
