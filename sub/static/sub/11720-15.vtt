That them?

00:21.299 --> 00:22.848
No, it's not them.

00:22.850 --> 00:24.750
When it's them, I'll tell you.
You keep asking me every

00:24.752 --> 00:25.918
two seconds.

00:25.920 --> 00:27.303
You okay?

00:27.305 --> 00:28.821
You seem nervous.
You all right?

00:28.823 --> 00:31.140
I'm not n... I'm excited, okay?
I'm very excited.

00:31.142 --> 00:33.425
This is the first time
my parents are coming to see me

00:33.427 --> 00:35.961
since I moved here,
so I am excited, okay?

00:35.963 --> 00:38.280
And maybe
slightly nervous

00:38.282 --> 00:41.283
for having to spend seven days
in a small space

00:41.285 --> 00:44.203
with these two people, okay?
They're both very impulsive,

00:44.205 --> 00:46.271
excitable, big personalities.

00:46.273 --> 00:48.123
They can lose their temper
at the drop of a hat.

00:48.125 --> 00:49.892
Ah. So they're
nothing like you.

00:49.894 --> 00:51.827
If you're gonna be sarcastic,
you can wait in the car.

00:51.829 --> 00:53.963
No, I'm just saying the apple
didn't fall far from the tree is all.

00:53.965 --> 00:55.581
Well, I didn't ask
for commentary.

00:55.583 --> 00:57.416
So if you want to be sympathetic,
Fine.

00:57.418 --> 00:58.617
a little compassion,
I'll take that,

00:58.619 --> 01:00.236
but the commentary I don't need.

01:00.238 --> 01:01.954
Hey, six o'clock,
big personality.

01:01.956 --> 01:03.121
There's my boy.

01:03.123 --> 01:05.057
Come here.
Ma.

01:06.460 --> 01:07.459
Look at you.

01:07.461 --> 01:08.961
Hey, Ma.
Hello, handsome.

01:08.963 --> 01:11.630
Mm, it's so good to see you.
It's so good to see you.

01:11.632 --> 01:13.139
Look at you. You look so good.
How was your flight?

01:13.164 --> 01:14.634
Thank you. It was very long.

01:14.635 --> 01:17.436
What?
Whoa, Ma, what's with all the luggage?

01:17.438 --> 01:18.971
You know I always overpack.

01:18.973 --> 01:20.973
No, I don't know that
because we never went anywhere.

01:20.975 --> 01:22.691
How would I know?

01:22.693 --> 01:23.943
You must be Steve.

01:23.945 --> 01:26.228
You must be Mrs. Williams.
Aloha.

01:26.230 --> 01:27.696
Aloha.

01:27.698 --> 01:30.082
Welcome to Hawaii.
You can call me

01:30.084 --> 01:31.066
Clara.
Clara. Okay.

01:31.068 --> 01:32.585
And mahalo.
Hey.

01:32.587 --> 01:33.869
I learned that on the plane.

01:33.871 --> 01:35.971
That's very good.
It's perfect pronunciation.

01:35.973 --> 01:37.172
Thanks.
So where's, uh...

01:37.174 --> 01:39.925
Thank you.
where's Pa, Ma? You, uh,

01:39.927 --> 01:42.261
stuff him in one of those big bags?

01:42.263 --> 01:44.663
Yeah, about that,
he couldn't make it this trip.

01:44.665 --> 01:46.048
But we'll talk about that later.

01:46.050 --> 01:49.134
What do you mean he couldn't
make the trip? What happened?

01:49.136 --> 01:51.420
Is he okay? What's going on?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's fine.

01:51.422 --> 01:53.188
Okay, so wh...
so why didn't he come?

01:53.190 --> 01:55.224
We'll talk about it later.

01:55.226 --> 01:57.726
Ma, just talk about it now.
Just tell me why he didn't come.

01:57.728 --> 02:01.780
Okay. Um...

02:01.782 --> 02:05.284
I'm leaving your father.
We're getting a divorce.

02:07.320 --> 02:09.705
Okay. I'm gonna... I'm gonna go

02:09.707 --> 02:11.991
somewhere else.

02:11.993 --> 02:13.959
Hey, you need a hand with those?

02:13.961 --> 02:15.811
All right.

02:15.813 --> 02:17.045
What do you... what do you mean
a divorce, Ma?

02:17.070 --> 02:18.498
A sports car?

02:18.499 --> 02:21.166
Really?
Isn't that

02:21.168 --> 02:22.751
a little obvious?
I mean, you still

02:22.753 --> 02:25.854
have your hair, you know.
Would you please focus here, Ma?

02:27.425 --> 02:30.509
This is really not the time
or the place.

02:30.511 --> 02:32.261
I disagree. This is the time.
What do you...

02:32.263 --> 02:33.812
what do you mean divor...
You can't get divorced.

02:33.814 --> 02:34.763
You've been married 40 years.

02:34.765 --> 02:37.382
Okay, 38 years
and this is America.

02:37.384 --> 02:39.435
I can get divorced
whenever I want to.

02:39.437 --> 02:40.653
Ask Kim Kardashian.

02:40.655 --> 02:42.554
Please don't do that.
Do what?

02:42.556 --> 02:43.822
Don't try to be funny.
This is serious.

02:43.824 --> 02:44.840
Please, Ma.

02:44.842 --> 02:46.892
I know this is serious.

02:46.894 --> 02:48.827
But I've thought about it a lot,

02:48.829 --> 02:51.580
and it's the decision
that I've made.

02:51.582 --> 02:53.699
And I need you to respect that,

02:53.701 --> 02:56.335
okay? Come on.

03:02.592 --> 03:04.259
What about here?

03:04.261 --> 03:05.644
Too low.

03:06.713 --> 03:08.330
Too high.

03:08.332 --> 03:09.882
A little more
to the middle.

03:09.884 --> 03:11.767
More. Mo...

03:11.769 --> 03:13.802
Wait. Too much. Go back.

03:13.804 --> 03:16.021
No, that is too far.

03:16.023 --> 03:17.589
That's it.

03:18.391 --> 03:20.192
I'm hanging it here.

03:21.077 --> 03:22.761
No, wait, just...

03:24.731 --> 03:26.648
I really think it should go
in the bedroom.

03:33.908 --> 03:35.040
Would you relax?

03:35.042 --> 03:36.375
It's just drywall.

04:52.352 --> 04:55.037
Yeah, he's also very impatient.
Have you noticed that part?

He wants what he wants
and he wants it right now.

04:57.875 --> 04:59.341
Well, I wonder
where I get that from.

04:59.343 --> 05:02.377
Oh, and now the mumbling starts.
He mumbles under his breath.

Mumble, mumble.
Oh, speaking of which,

05:09.220 --> 05:12.838
I do not want you calling them
about this, do you hear me?

05:12.840 --> 05:15.373
I'm gonna tell them in person.
You do that

05:15.375 --> 05:16.809
because I'll tell you
what's gonna happen:

05:16.811 --> 05:17.876
you're gonna tell 'em
What?

05:17.878 --> 05:18.927
and they're gonna
lose their mind.

05:18.929 --> 05:19.878
They're gonna freak out.

05:19.880 --> 05:21.680
Oh. Wow.
Just so you know.

05:21.682 --> 05:23.482
As opposed to what you're doing,
right?

05:23.484 --> 05:25.684
I'm not freaking out,
if that's what you mean, okay?

05:25.686 --> 05:27.152
This is a completely
legitimate response

05:27.154 --> 05:29.021
to some very upsetting news.
You know,

05:29.023 --> 05:33.558
you're very dramatic,
honey. Really.

05:37.363 --> 05:38.664
Nice house.

05:41.535 --> 05:45.020
Hey, Chin, hey. We catch...
we catch a case or what?

05:45.022 --> 05:47.206
Great. No, great.

05:47.208 --> 05:48.941
Send me the address.
I'll be right there.

05:48.943 --> 05:51.460
All right, good.
I got to go.

05:51.462 --> 05:53.262
Uh, got to get to a crime scene.

05:53.264 --> 05:54.396
Lucky you.

05:54.398 --> 05:55.681
Well,

05:55.683 --> 05:56.698

Yeah.
Sean Hutton.

Honolulu Register.

06:19.073 --> 06:21.456
We met at the governor's
Christmas party last year.

06:21.458 --> 06:22.604
Oh, sure, I remember.
How you doing?

06:22.605 --> 06:23.166
Good, good.

06:23.191 --> 06:24.944
Hey, listen, I can't
give you a statement.

06:24.945 --> 06:26.078
I haven't even seen
the crime scene.

06:26.080 --> 06:27.779
No, I'm not here
to talk about that.

06:27.781 --> 06:29.631
I want to talk
about Lou Grover.

06:29.633 --> 06:30.832
What about him?

06:30.834 --> 06:32.918
Well, I'm doing a story
on our new SWAT captain.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.836
I wanted to see if you'd go
on record about him.

06:34.838 --> 06:37.256
Ah. Okay, well, listen, we
just started working together,

06:37.258 --> 06:40.475
so there's, uh, not much
I can tell you, okay? - Right.

06:40.477 --> 06:43.929
Did you know he left Chicago
under a cloud?

06:46.182 --> 06:48.233
What kind of story
are you writing?

06:48.235 --> 06:51.570
There was an incident,
a hostage situation.

06:51.572 --> 06:54.022
And from what I hear,
Grover screwed up

06:54.024 --> 06:55.307
and the Chicago PD buried it.

06:55.309 --> 06:57.192
Okay, well, I don't know
anything about that.

06:57.194 --> 06:59.745
Yeah, I'm sure you don't.
'Cause if you did,

06:59.747 --> 07:01.363
you would've told
the chief of police

07:01.365 --> 07:03.005
and then Grover
never would've been hired.

07:03.833 --> 07:05.650
Yeah, maybe.

07:05.652 --> 07:07.485
But if you're gonna go down
that road, Mr. Hutton,

07:07.487 --> 07:09.004
you better make damn sure
your facts are straight

07:09.006 --> 07:10.956
or you could ruin a
good man's career.

07:10.958 --> 07:12.824
With all due respect,
Commander,

07:12.826 --> 07:14.648
I don't need you to tell me
how to write a story.

07:14.649 --> 07:15.159
Ah.

07:15.184 --> 07:17.278
Okay? And I'm gonna write
this story

07:17.439 --> 07:18.789
whether you cooperate or not.

07:19.450 --> 07:21.633
Then we got nothing more
to talk about.

07:23.669 --> 07:25.354
<i>Here we go.</i>

07:25.356 --> 07:28.307
I've got the rest
of your body right here.

07:28.309 --> 07:31.843
Based on the facial features
and bone structure,

07:31.845 --> 07:34.112
it appears to be an adult male.

07:34.114 --> 07:36.531
However,
an accurate age estimate

07:36.533 --> 07:37.616
is gonna be difficult to make.

07:37.618 --> 07:39.618
Any idea how long
he's been in there?

07:39.620 --> 07:43.038
The state of mummification
leads me to conclude

07:43.040 --> 07:45.774
that the range is somewhere
between five to seven months.

07:45.776 --> 07:48.160
Five to seven months.

07:48.162 --> 07:51.079
How long have the
Sakatas lived here?

07:51.081 --> 07:52.514
They just moved
in last week.

07:52.516 --> 07:54.049
Oh, I think I found

07:54.051 --> 07:56.001
our cause of death.
Take a look.

07:57.253 --> 07:59.421
A single GSW to the head.

07:59.423 --> 08:02.357
- That'll do it every time.
- All right, I've seen enough,

08:02.359 --> 08:04.709
Max. Let's get him out of there.
As you wish.

08:16.356 --> 08:18.440
Who am I?

08:19.225 --> 08:20.525
Someone who's about to get shot?

08:20.527 --> 08:23.228
Leatherface.

08:23.230 --> 08:25.447
Oh, man.
You guys are no fun at all.

09:00.033 --> 09:01.400
Guy Ingram.

09:04.220 --> 09:06.538
I recognize this guy.

09:06.540 --> 09:08.240
Well, this might be why.

09:08.242 --> 09:10.108
Kahu Realty.

09:10.110 --> 09:12.544
Oh, yeah.His face

09:12.546 --> 09:14.913
was plastered on bus benches
all over the Island, right?

09:14.915 --> 09:16.148
"When you're ready
to buy, call Guy.

09:16.150 --> 09:18.950
I'll be there to
welcome you home".

09:20.970 --> 09:23.121
In this case, literally.

09:33.993 --> 09:37.329
<i>Fingerprints confirm our</i>
<i>victim is indeed Guy Ingram.</i>

09:37.331 --> 09:38.981
44 years old, single.

09:38.983 --> 09:40.865
He moved here two years ago
from the mainland.

09:40.867 --> 09:43.302
His relatives in Cleveland
have been notified.

09:43.304 --> 09:46.672
The bullet that killed him
was a .22 caliber round

09:46.674 --> 09:49.541
shot in close proximity.
I already sent it to Ballistics.

09:49.543 --> 09:51.009
All right, so,

09:51.011 --> 09:52.877
what else do we know
about Mr. Ingram?

09:52.879 --> 09:54.346
Well, I was able
to determine

09:54.348 --> 09:56.682
that the T.O.D. was
six months ago. More precisely,

09:56.684 --> 09:58.150
August 7.

09:58.152 --> 10:00.602
Wow, you have an exact date.

10:00.604 --> 10:01.937
That's very impressive, Max.

10:01.939 --> 10:03.905
Well, I can't take full credit
for that assessment.

10:03.907 --> 10:07.242
After thoroughly going through
the victim's garments,

10:07.244 --> 10:09.745
I was able to discover
that he was in possession

10:09.747 --> 10:12.063
of an airline ticket,
which you can see was issued

10:12.065 --> 10:13.999
for a flight on August 7.

10:14.001 --> 10:16.335
Right. Looks like he was headed
to Los Angeles.

10:16.337 --> 10:17.869
I'm thinking the murder
prevented him

10:17.871 --> 10:19.121
from making that flight.

10:20.556 --> 10:22.341
Pop, it's me. Again.

10:22.343 --> 10:24.376
Okay, please,
when you get this message

10:24.378 --> 10:27.746
or any of the other 19 messages
I left you, please call me back.

10:27.748 --> 10:30.432
Look, whatever's going on
with Mom, it is fixable.

10:30.434 --> 10:33.402
So call me and, uh,
we will work it out, okay?

10:33.404 --> 10:36.004
Okay. Call me. Bye.

Hello, sweetheart.
Hi, Ma.

10:54.708 --> 10:56.208
I love your house.

10:56.210 --> 10:59.044
Oh, thank you. I think this one,
uh, is a keeper.

10:59.046 --> 11:00.688
What are you, uh...
what are you doing?

11:00.713 --> 11:01.381
I'm making you lunch.

11:01.382 --> 11:04.082
Oh, good. I'm starving.
You doing the, uh,

11:04.084 --> 11:05.100
macaroni and ketchup sauce?

11:05.102 --> 11:06.101
Yeah.

11:06.103 --> 11:07.419
They serve that in prison,
you know.

11:07.421 --> 11:08.920
You loved this
when you were a kid.

11:08.922 --> 11:10.722
I know-- I was fond
of eating crayons, too,

11:10.724 --> 11:11.840
but I gave that up.

11:11.842 --> 11:13.675
Oh, your...
Ah, ah. I got it.

11:13.677 --> 11:15.260
I'm gonna cook.
Really?

11:15.262 --> 11:17.462
We'll make a nice
ten-minute sauce.

11:19.766 --> 11:21.966
Bing, bing,

11:21.968 --> 11:23.301
and bing.
There we go.

11:23.303 --> 11:25.970
You have some very impressive
knife skills there, honey.

11:25.972 --> 11:29.107
Thank you, thank you.
So, when did you learn to cook?

11:29.109 --> 11:31.309
Well, uh, when Rachel left,
I had no choice.

11:31.311 --> 11:34.312
I was either gonna watch the
Food Network a couple times a week,

11:34.314 --> 11:36.782
or Grace and I were
gonna eat takeout every day.

11:36.784 --> 11:39.167
So...
Mm.

11:39.169 --> 11:42.204
Speaking of people
leaving other people, Ma...

11:42.206 --> 11:44.803
Speaking of Grace, what time
does she get out of school?

11:44.804 --> 11:46.492
I'm dying
to see my grandbaby.

11:46.493 --> 11:48.543
Okay, Ma...
Yeah?

11:49.462 --> 11:51.162
Ah, here we go.
Listen...

11:51.164 --> 11:53.548
Yeah, here we go. You cannot come
here and tell me

11:53.550 --> 11:56.134
you're getting divorced,
and then not explain what's going on.

11:56.136 --> 11:58.854
All right? So please tell me what is
going on, because when I came home

11:58.856 --> 12:01.106
for Dad's birthday,
everything seemed fine.

12:01.108 --> 12:02.974
Apart from me crying
on your shoulder

12:02.976 --> 12:06.445
because he used our vacation fund
to buy a stupid sports car?

12:06.447 --> 12:08.864
Okay, if it's about the money,
about the trip, I-I'll treat you guys.

12:08.866 --> 12:11.015
I'll pay for the trip myself.
No, no, it's not about the money,

12:11.017 --> 12:12.717
it's not about
the vacation fund--

12:12.719 --> 12:14.870
it's the fact that
your father always said

12:14.872 --> 12:17.689
that when he retired,
it would be <i>our</i> time.

12:17.691 --> 12:19.918
It would be our time to travel,

12:19.943 --> 12:21.744
it would be our time
to take dancing lessons,

12:21.745 --> 12:23.044
it would be...

12:23.046 --> 12:26.164
our time to fall in
love all over again.

12:26.166 --> 12:28.049
And he has not
kept that promise.

12:28.051 --> 12:32.370
I mean, this is the third act
of my life, sweetheart.

12:32.372 --> 12:35.206
You know? I want
it to be great.

12:35.208 --> 12:37.726
So if I can't
have <i>our</i> time,

12:37.728 --> 12:39.845
I'm gonna have <i>my</i> time.

12:39.847 --> 12:42.347
Because I deserve that.

12:47.804 --> 12:50.522
I'm gonna set
the table.

12:52.826 --> 12:55.377
<i>According to the airline,</i>

12:55.379 --> 12:56.912
Guy Ingram purchased
a one-way ticket

12:56.914 --> 12:59.564
to Los Angeles a few days
before he was murdered.

12:59.566 --> 13:02.000
Okay, uh, one-way, so he
wasn't planning on coming back.

13:02.002 --> 13:03.919
Maybe he knew that
somebody was after him

13:03.921 --> 13:06.538
and he decided to skip town.
He wasn't going alone.

13:06.540 --> 13:08.206
According to
his itinerary,

13:08.208 --> 13:10.375
he purchased a second ticket,
same flight, same day.

13:10.377 --> 13:12.744
Passenger's name
was Sally Ann Caldwell.

13:12.746 --> 13:15.881
And the airline said that she
didn't make the flight, either.

13:15.883 --> 13:18.133
What do we know
about Sally Ann Caldwell?

13:18.135 --> 13:21.436
Not much. I ran her name through
the local DMV, came up empty.

13:21.438 --> 13:22.888
Well, there's got
to be <i>something.</i> I mean,

13:22.890 --> 13:24.389
he bought her a ticket, right?
They've got

13:24.391 --> 13:26.274
to be connected somehow.
We need to find her.

13:26.276 --> 13:28.259
CSU was able to pull some prints

13:28.261 --> 13:29.561
from the plaster
behind the wall.

13:29.563 --> 13:31.029
We checked AFIS, got no hits,

13:31.031 --> 13:32.898
but we're still running them
through other databases.

13:32.900 --> 13:36.768
Also got an interesting lead
on one of Ingram's coworkers.

13:36.770 --> 13:39.020
Cherie Tranton.

13:39.022 --> 13:40.555
Recognize her?
Yeah.

13:40.557 --> 13:42.707
She provided us intel
on the Hutchins murder.

13:42.709 --> 13:44.409
Mm-hmm.
According to the office manager,

13:44.411 --> 13:46.795
she and Guy Ingram
were very competitive.

13:46.797 --> 13:48.997
So after he
supposedly left town,

13:48.999 --> 13:50.715
she aggressively took over
all his listings.

13:50.717 --> 13:51.967
We're talking
dozens of commissions

13:51.969 --> 13:53.635
on high-end real estate
transactions.

13:53.637 --> 13:55.503
That's a lot of cash.

13:55.505 --> 13:57.288
That's definitely motive.
And as a real estate agent,

13:57.290 --> 13:59.808
she had access to the crime scene.
Let's see if

13:59.810 --> 14:02.510
Cherie Tranton's also got
any carpentry skills, huh?

14:02.512 --> 14:03.862
Copy that.

14:03.864 --> 14:05.063
Yeah.

14:05.065 --> 14:06.264
Danny, what's up?

14:06.266 --> 14:08.733
Okay, uh, in ten minutes,
you were gonna call me

14:08.735 --> 14:10.769
and tell me
there's a very urgent situation

14:10.771 --> 14:12.404
that needs
my immediate attention,

14:12.406 --> 14:14.472
and you need me in the office
right away, okay?

14:14.474 --> 14:15.824
Can you do that, please?

14:15.826 --> 14:18.126
I'm sorry. You want me to lie
so you can ditch your mom?

14:18.128 --> 14:19.327
Yes, I do, okay?

14:19.329 --> 14:21.246
This divorce thing's
got my head spinning,

14:21.248 --> 14:23.448
and, uh, I just need some time.

14:23.450 --> 14:24.833
I need some time alone, okay?

14:24.835 --> 14:26.534
So why don't you just
tell her that, Danny?

14:26.536 --> 14:28.036
Well, because if I tell her
I need some time alone,

14:28.038 --> 14:29.421
she'll say, "Me, too.
Let's go together."

14:29.423 --> 14:30.538
That's the way she is.

14:30.540 --> 14:32.440
Can you just please do this
for me, please?

14:32.442 --> 14:33.675
Okay, fine, but next Side Street
is on you.

14:33.677 --> 14:34.960
Really? 'Cause it's always
on me.

14:34.962 --> 14:36.661
Okay, well,
you just owe me one then.

14:36.663 --> 14:38.013
What is it with you?

14:38.015 --> 14:39.881
Everything is so mercenary.
You can't just do a friend

14:39.883 --> 14:41.883
a solid? You can't do that out
of the kindness of your heart?

14:41.885 --> 14:44.386
Daniel, the fancy lunch
you made is getting cold.

14:44.388 --> 14:46.771
I have to go.
Please just say yes?

14:46.773 --> 14:48.807
Okay.

14:48.809 --> 14:50.191
Thank you. Ten minutes.

14:55.815 --> 14:57.682
Captain Grover.

14:57.684 --> 14:59.234
Let me guess.
Sean Hutton.

14:59.236 --> 15:00.535
McGarrett already filled me in.

15:00.537 --> 15:02.520
I got nothing to say to you.

15:02.522 --> 15:05.189
I know all about
the Molina case.

15:05.191 --> 15:07.125
And I think

15:07.127 --> 15:10.361
it might not have been handled
the way it should have been.

15:10.363 --> 15:12.363
Yeah? Well, Chicago PD
may beg to differ.

15:12.365 --> 15:14.699
See, I was investigated
thoroughly, and I was cleared.

15:14.701 --> 15:16.918
Well, the brass was
looking out for you.

15:16.920 --> 15:20.305
Believe me, I know
that happens.

15:20.307 --> 15:23.808
Yet, six months later, you
quit the department anyway.

15:23.810 --> 15:26.711
See, that's the part
that I can't figure out.

15:26.713 --> 15:28.730
You had a great
thing going on there.

15:28.732 --> 15:30.398
Why come all
the way out here

15:30.400 --> 15:32.150
where you've got no
one to protect you?

15:32.152 --> 15:34.352
I don't need anybody
to protect me,

15:34.354 --> 15:35.820
'cause I do my job right.

15:35.822 --> 15:38.189
Then give me your side.

15:38.191 --> 15:40.492
Convince me that I'm wrong
about you, Captain,

15:40.494 --> 15:41.776
and the whole story changes.

15:41.778 --> 15:43.862
What, are we pals now,
or something?

15:43.864 --> 15:45.347
You're gonna look out for me?

15:45.349 --> 15:47.282
All right.

15:47.284 --> 15:49.668
You're not giving me
a choice here.

15:49.670 --> 15:53.705
24 hours. If I don't hear
your side, I run what I have.

15:53.707 --> 15:55.590
And believe me, you're not gonna
like it, Captain.

15:55.592 --> 15:58.293
Now, you're not threatening me
now, are you, son?

15:58.295 --> 16:02.246
I'm just telling you.

16:02.248 --> 16:04.382
24 hours.

16:05.217 --> 16:07.469
The ball's in your court.

16:17.196 --> 16:18.763
Honestly, you can
call me any time.

16:18.765 --> 16:21.599
I never sleep. I'm
like a zombie. Here.

16:21.601 --> 16:23.585
My number's right there.
Come back again.

16:23.587 --> 16:25.670
Bye.

16:25.672 --> 16:27.455
Aloha.

16:27.457 --> 16:30.325
Is this not
the dream house?

16:30.327 --> 16:34.278
It has everything,
and the owners

16:34.280 --> 16:35.714
just reduced the price.

16:35.716 --> 16:37.549
They're super motivated to sell.

16:37.551 --> 16:38.917
You two got kids?

16:39.802 --> 16:40.885
Who, us?

16:40.887 --> 16:42.286
Uh, no, we're not married.

16:42.288 --> 16:44.923
Who needs papers nowadays,
right?

16:44.925 --> 16:47.809
All that matters
is two people

16:47.811 --> 16:50.628
who love each other need
a good roof over their heads.

16:50.630 --> 16:53.181
And this one, by the way,
was just retiled.

16:53.183 --> 16:55.984
Miss Tranton,
we're not here about the house.

16:58.270 --> 16:59.738
Okay.

16:59.740 --> 17:02.574
I just can't believe it.

17:02.576 --> 17:06.277
I-I thought Guy moved
to Los Angeles.

17:07.496 --> 17:11.583
I showed that house over 50
times in the last six months.

17:11.585 --> 17:15.002
To think that he was in there,

17:15.005 --> 17:18.790
in that wall the whole time.

17:18.791 --> 17:21.209
Why would someone do that
to him?

17:21.211 --> 17:23.328
How many commissions
did you cash in on

17:23.329 --> 17:25.096
after Mr. Ingram
disappeared?

17:25.098 --> 17:28.683
What are you insinuating?

17:28.685 --> 17:31.970
That I had something to do
with his murder?

17:31.972 --> 17:34.355
We understand the two of you were
extremely competitive.

17:34.357 --> 17:38.059
We fought over
every listing, okay?

17:38.061 --> 17:40.195
That is the nature of the
real estate business here.

17:40.197 --> 17:42.647
It's a small island.
There's only so many big deals.

17:42.649 --> 17:44.065
But why would I kill Guy?

17:44.067 --> 17:46.184
He was moving to Los Angeles.

17:46.186 --> 17:48.153
Well, maybe he changed
his mind.

17:48.155 --> 17:50.221
Maybe he decided to hang
onto those pricey listings.

17:50.223 --> 17:52.624
You are barking up
the wrong tree.

17:52.626 --> 17:54.209
Okay. Well,
then you wouldn't mind

17:54.211 --> 17:55.443
if we took some fingerprints.

17:55.445 --> 17:58.463
Knock yourselves out.

18:00.383 --> 18:02.533
Hey, Charlie,
what's up?

18:05.504 --> 18:07.472
Okay, got it.
We're on our way.

18:07.474 --> 18:10.341
So, Ballistics got a hit on the
slug we pulled out of Ingram.

18:10.343 --> 18:13.561
It matches a weapon used in
a jewelry store heist two years ago.

18:13.563 --> 18:15.379
HPD closed the case

18:15.381 --> 18:17.315
and the weapon was recovered
and vouchered.

18:17.317 --> 18:19.434
If that gun is sitting
in an evidence room,

18:19.436 --> 18:21.436
how was it used
to kill our vic?

18:30.749 --> 18:32.466
<i>My mother</i>
<i>is definitely serious</i>

18:32.468 --> 18:34.001
about this divorce thing.

18:35.203 --> 18:37.888
Okay.

18:37.890 --> 18:39.790
She's serious today.

18:39.792 --> 18:42.509
Danny, give her a couple days
to think about it,

18:42.511 --> 18:43.944
you know,
let it sink in...

18:43.946 --> 18:46.480
I'm telling you, okay,
she has made up her mind.

18:46.482 --> 18:48.983
My mother is singing

18:48.985 --> 18:51.819
in my kitchen. She's singing
"I Saw the Sign."

18:51.821 --> 18:53.771
You know that song,
"I Saw the Sign"?

18:53.773 --> 18:55.222
I don't know the song.

18:55.224 --> 18:57.825
Okay, well, let me explain
the song to you, okay?

18:57.827 --> 18:59.777
It goes like this. "I saw the sign.
Mm-hmm.

18:59.779 --> 19:01.328
"It opened up my mind.
Hmm.

19:01.330 --> 19:03.781
And now I am happy
living without you."

19:03.783 --> 19:04.948
You know the one?

19:04.950 --> 19:07.484
Sing me a couple bars.
Just the first couple...

19:07.486 --> 19:09.169
You sing me a couple bars.
Do me favor.

19:09.171 --> 19:10.570
You gonna bust my chops right now?
I'm trying...

19:10.572 --> 19:12.456
Look, I don't get it, all right?
It's a song.

19:12.458 --> 19:13.874
It's a song.
It's just a song.

19:13.876 --> 19:15.175
It's a song that is about

19:15.177 --> 19:16.910
being happy and
moving on in life.

19:16.912 --> 19:17.845
The horror.

19:17.847 --> 19:19.246
Look, it's not
just the song.

19:19.248 --> 19:20.597
She's saying some
very disturbing things.

19:20.599 --> 19:22.349
She's talking about "me time,"
right?

19:22.351 --> 19:24.268
Third act of her life.
It's all very unsettling

19:24.270 --> 19:25.853
to hear from your mother,
trust me.

19:25.855 --> 19:27.438
Next thing, she'll be dating.

19:28.306 --> 19:30.340
Why would you say that to me?

19:30.342 --> 19:31.725
Well, because it's a natural...

19:31.727 --> 19:33.427
Why would you say...?
You were getting there.

19:33.429 --> 19:34.445
I was not getting there.
I would never get there.

19:34.447 --> 19:35.579
This is my mother
we're talking about.

19:35.581 --> 19:37.147
Yeah. Who, Danny,
if we're being honest,

19:37.149 --> 19:38.382
happens to be a beautiful woman.

19:38.384 --> 19:39.533
Whoa! Hey!

19:39.535 --> 19:40.484
What, she not gonna date again?

19:40.486 --> 19:42.436
Oh! Enough!
That's it!

19:42.438 --> 19:44.204
No more talking
about it, okay?

19:44.206 --> 19:45.272
Fine, okay.

19:45.274 --> 19:46.206
I should have my head examined

19:46.208 --> 19:47.658
for coming here asking
you advice

19:47.660 --> 19:49.209
in the first place. Your mother,
she couldn't even get divorced

19:49.211 --> 19:50.627
like a normal human being.
She had to pretend

19:50.629 --> 19:52.279
she was dead
to get away from your father!

19:52.281 --> 19:54.715
Hey! Hey!

19:54.717 --> 19:56.800
What?
Take it easy.

19:56.802 --> 19:59.887
I'm supportive of my mother,
okay?

19:59.889 --> 20:01.338
When she lets me.

20:01.340 --> 20:02.923
Uh-huh.

20:02.925 --> 20:06.026
That's, uh, just the slightest
bit of revisionist history.

20:06.028 --> 20:06.960
Excuse me?

20:06.962 --> 20:08.128
Well, I was there

20:08.130 --> 20:09.629
when you brought her home
from Japan,

20:09.631 --> 20:11.932
and, uh, you wouldn't even
look at her in the face

20:11.934 --> 20:13.150
and you wouldn't call her "Mom".

20:13.152 --> 20:16.186
Yeah, because Doris and I had
some issues, okay,

20:16.188 --> 20:18.105
when she got back from Japan
after 20 years.

20:18.107 --> 20:20.140
And then what happened?
I was supportive.

20:20.142 --> 20:22.976
Your mom needs you, Danny.

20:22.978 --> 20:25.179
Just be there for her.

20:27.365 --> 20:30.150
Sure, I remember
that case.

20:30.152 --> 20:32.252
The owner was shot
during a robbery.

20:32.254 --> 20:33.370
We caught the guy,

20:33.372 --> 20:36.173
he's doing a ten-year
bit in Halawa.

20:36.175 --> 20:37.991
Okay, and that weapon
was logged into evidence?

20:37.993 --> 20:40.210
It went from here
to the courthouse and back.

20:40.212 --> 20:42.162
If you got a hit
to that gun,

20:42.164 --> 20:44.214
it's gotta
be a mistake.

20:45.467 --> 20:48.185
That's it. That's the
case you're looking for.

20:52.507 --> 20:53.891
It's gone.

21:08.540 --> 21:10.023
Thanks for coming, man.

21:10.025 --> 21:12.159
Of course.

21:13.027 --> 21:14.628
I take it you met Sean Hutton.

21:14.630 --> 21:15.796
Oh, yeah.

21:15.798 --> 21:17.864
Yeah, I met Sean Hutton,
all right.

21:17.866 --> 21:20.834
He's a... he's a man
on a mission.

21:20.836 --> 21:22.369
He's gonna put out
this story whether

21:22.371 --> 21:23.954
he gets all
the facts or not.

21:23.956 --> 21:25.923
Okay, well,
you gotta talk to him.

21:25.925 --> 21:28.976
I don't even think that's
gonna change his mind.

21:28.978 --> 21:30.928
What, you're saying
he's right?

21:34.782 --> 21:36.716
I'm saying it's complicated.

21:46.727 --> 21:47.727
Back in Chicago,

21:47.729 --> 21:49.613
I was on the department
fast track.

21:49.615 --> 21:51.198
I'd gone from
being a uniform

21:51.200 --> 21:55.902
to head of SWAT
in 15 years.

21:55.904 --> 21:58.789
One night we get a call.

21:58.791 --> 22:01.875
Hostage situation.

22:01.877 --> 22:06.079
Guy's name is
Jorge Molina.

22:06.081 --> 22:09.800
And Jorge was very angry
with his ex-wife.

22:11.186 --> 22:13.937
She goes over to his place to
pick up their two-year-old son

22:13.939 --> 22:16.923
for her visitation,
he locks her out of the place.

22:16.925 --> 22:19.426
Then he tells her
he's got a gun.

22:19.428 --> 22:21.395
And he's threatening the boy

22:21.397 --> 22:23.096
and he's threatening
to harm himself,

22:23.098 --> 22:24.764
so we come over there.

22:24.766 --> 22:26.433
Set up a perimeter.

22:27.485 --> 22:28.902
And I get on the phone with him.

22:28.904 --> 22:32.539
Why not
a hostage negotiator?

22:32.541 --> 22:34.725
Because I knew Jorge.

22:36.160 --> 22:37.995
Back when I was a uniform,

22:37.997 --> 22:40.447
seemed like every weekend
I was over at his parents' house

22:40.449 --> 22:42.499
on a domestic call, so

22:42.501 --> 22:44.885
I earned his trust, and, uh...

22:44.887 --> 22:46.720
I thought for sure
he'd listen to me.

22:48.473 --> 22:50.474
Jorge.
Who's this?!

22:50.476 --> 22:52.759
This is Captain Grover,
you remember me, right?

22:52.761 --> 22:54.695
Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember you.

22:54.697 --> 22:56.730
All right, Jorge,
listen, I know you,

22:56.732 --> 22:58.065
what you doing in there
scaring everybody?

22:58.067 --> 23:00.133
Man, I know you
don't want to hurt nobody.

23:00.135 --> 23:01.768
Especially your baby.

23:01.770 --> 23:03.437
She wants to take him
away from me.

23:03.439 --> 23:04.638
And I don't want to give him up.

23:04.640 --> 23:06.740
I want to see him.
I understand, I understand that.

23:06.742 --> 23:09.042
But I got you on that,
I'm gonna help you with that.

23:09.044 --> 23:11.578
All you got to do is come
outside and surrender to me.

23:11.580 --> 23:13.580
A second later I'm gonna
be on the phone with CPS.

23:13.582 --> 23:15.816
I'm gonna vouch for you
and I'm gonna tell them

23:15.818 --> 23:17.784
you're a good guy.
Well...

23:17.786 --> 23:20.203
okay. Yeah, yeah,
you were always good

23:20.205 --> 23:21.655
to me and my family.

23:22.840 --> 23:24.458
I had him, man. I had him.

23:24.460 --> 23:27.761
To this day, I don't
know what set him off.

23:27.763 --> 23:31.014
Jorge, you got to listen to me.
Captain, Jenkins says he has the shot.

23:31.016 --> 23:32.783
I don't know, I don't think so.
Listen to me, listen to me, Jorge.

23:32.785 --> 23:34.101
Look at me. Look at me,
I'm taking off my vest.

23:34.103 --> 23:36.670
Captain...
Huh? I'm taking off my gun.

23:36.672 --> 23:39.172
<i>The snipers radioed in</i>
<i>and said they had a shot</i>

23:39.174 --> 23:41.525
<i>through the front window.</i>

23:41.527 --> 23:43.677
<i>But I made 'em hold off.</i>

23:43.679 --> 23:45.896
You want to point that gun at
somebody, you point it at me.

23:45.898 --> 23:47.611
We can take him down.
All we need is the green light.

23:47.612 --> 23:48.883
Okay? I trust you.
That's why I'm out here like this.

23:48.884 --> 23:50.067
Just need the green
light, Captain.

23:50.069 --> 23:51.785
All you have to do
is walk outside Captain.

23:51.787 --> 23:53.453
with your hands in the air.
We just need the go-ahead.

23:53.455 --> 23:54.438
And everything's
gonna be fine.

23:54.440 --> 23:56.657
<i>I made the decision to wait.</i>

23:56.659 --> 23:57.641
You can trust me.

23:57.643 --> 23:58.858
No, you're lying.

23:58.860 --> 24:00.243
You're lying just
to get me out there.

24:00.245 --> 24:02.195
You're lying!
No, I've always been straight with you.

24:02.197 --> 24:03.547
Just give us the green light.
Anything that I've ever

24:03.549 --> 24:06.249
told you I'm gonna do, I always do.
Captain.

24:06.251 --> 24:08.468
We can take him down.
Isn't that right? Isn't that right?

24:08.470 --> 24:10.003
Just give us the green light, Captain.
I'm always gonna be straight...

24:10.005 --> 24:11.638
I can't come out.
All right, come on outside with me.

24:11.640 --> 24:13.256
I'm sorry. - Come on, come on. Just come out
with your hands up.

24:13.258 --> 24:16.009
It's too late! It's too late.
It's... it's too late. - All right?

24:16.011 --> 24:17.627
Do we have a green light?
No, no, no. It's not too late, son.

24:17.629 --> 24:19.313
Let us take the shot.
It's not too late.

24:19.315 --> 24:20.597
It's too late, Captain.
It looks bad, but it's not too late.

24:20.599 --> 24:22.182
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

24:22.184 --> 24:24.334
I'm so sorry.
No, don't say that, son. Don't say that!

24:24.336 --> 24:26.436
No, Jorge, don't do it!
You don't want to do that.

24:26.438 --> 24:28.188
You're not a... No!

24:41.502 --> 24:43.387
<i>So I go into the house,</i>

24:43.389 --> 24:45.972
<i>and they're both dead.</i>

24:50.545 --> 24:52.295
<i>And his little boy,</i>
<i>Christian...</i>

24:54.482 --> 24:56.166
...he was lying on the floor...

24:57.952 --> 24:59.736
<i>...with his blanket...</i>

24:59.738 --> 25:01.922
<i>little stuffed animal.</i>

25:05.760 --> 25:07.394
<i>Blood everywhere.</i>

25:13.451 --> 25:15.569
I hope you never see
something like that, man,

25:15.571 --> 25:17.788
because you'll remember it
for the rest of your life.

25:19.907 --> 25:22.042
You made a call, Lou.

25:22.044 --> 25:23.943
All right?

25:23.945 --> 25:25.879
It's not your fault,
what happened.

25:25.881 --> 25:28.882
That's what
they told me!

25:28.884 --> 25:31.585
That's what
I told myself.

25:31.587 --> 25:34.287
But I still couldn't
get past the idea

25:34.289 --> 25:36.006
that if I had just
done one thing,

25:36.008 --> 25:38.475
just one thing
different...

25:38.477 --> 25:41.294
that that little boy
would still be alive.

25:44.182 --> 25:46.400
Chicago PD cleared me.

25:47.802 --> 25:50.320
But I couldn't get past it.

25:50.322 --> 25:52.439
And I'm fightin' with my wife,

25:52.441 --> 25:54.608
and I'm yellin' at my kids...

25:57.812 --> 25:59.613
The best friend
I had in the world,

25:59.615 --> 26:00.997
I get into
a little argument with him

26:00.999 --> 26:02.115
and I end up punching

26:02.117 --> 26:04.251
the guy.

26:09.624 --> 26:11.708
And I spent so many nights,

26:11.710 --> 26:12.793
late at night,

26:12.795 --> 26:14.428
pacing the floor
in my living room,

26:14.430 --> 26:15.462
on my eighth beer,

26:15.464 --> 26:17.497
my ninth beer,
my tenth beer.

26:17.499 --> 26:19.249
And I'm
angry

26:19.251 --> 26:21.551
and I'm trying to...

26:21.553 --> 26:24.805
I'm counting all the people
that pissed me off that day.

26:24.807 --> 26:28.475
And I'm asking, "What the hell
is wrong with everybody?"

26:32.480 --> 26:33.697
Well,
eventually...

26:35.316 --> 26:37.818
...I figured out
what the problem was.

26:38.953 --> 26:40.287
And it was me.

26:43.658 --> 26:45.625
And unless I wanted
to ruin my career

26:45.627 --> 26:47.744
and wreck my marriage,

26:47.746 --> 26:50.413
I had to get the hell
out of Chicago, man.

26:50.415 --> 26:52.883
Because driving
down those streets,

26:52.885 --> 26:57.137
every little kid I saw...

26:57.139 --> 26:59.673
was Christian Molina.

27:05.147 --> 27:07.230
So...

27:07.232 --> 27:08.648
I put in for the
job out here.

27:08.650 --> 27:10.650
I figured,
why not put

27:10.652 --> 27:13.320
6,000 miles and
an ocean between me

27:13.322 --> 27:14.404
and my problems?

27:14.406 --> 27:16.573
And then this Sean Hutton
comes around.

27:16.575 --> 27:19.860
And he's bringing it all
right back to my front door,

27:19.862 --> 27:21.895
and I'm gonna have
to deal with this

27:21.897 --> 27:23.396
all over again.

27:23.398 --> 27:24.447
All the guilt.

27:24.449 --> 27:25.782
All the questions.

27:33.208 --> 27:35.775
You've got my full support.

27:35.777 --> 27:37.894
All right?

27:42.300 --> 27:44.050
I really appreciate that, man.

27:47.221 --> 27:49.556
That's why I come
down here to talk to you.

27:49.558 --> 27:52.392
I know you got things
you're keeping inside

27:52.394 --> 27:55.094
and you gotta get these things
off your chest,

27:55.096 --> 27:57.764
or I swear,
they're gonna press the air

27:57.766 --> 27:59.733
right out
of you.

27:59.735 --> 28:00.884
And then
you're gonna

28:00.886 --> 28:02.068
end up just like m...

28:12.112 --> 28:14.331
You know what
I'm trying to say, right?

28:20.805 --> 28:22.722
Yeah.

28:44.820 --> 28:45.703
Hello, sweetheart.

28:45.705 --> 28:46.904
Hey.
Hi.

28:46.906 --> 28:47.905
Ma, I, uh...

28:47.907 --> 28:49.106
just got home.

28:49.108 --> 28:51.325
Thought maybe we, uh...
could have a talk.

28:51.327 --> 28:52.543
Where, uh... where are you?

28:52.545 --> 28:54.111
At the Hilton.

28:54.113 --> 28:55.663
We're just hanging by the pool.

28:55.665 --> 28:56.631
We?

28:56.633 --> 28:57.832
Who's "we"?

28:57.834 --> 28:59.217
What are you... what,
are you on a date, Ma?

28:59.219 --> 29:00.585
I am, actually.

29:00.587 --> 29:01.602
With my beautiful

29:01.604 --> 29:03.054
granddaughter.

29:03.056 --> 29:04.505
That's-that's
completely impossible,

29:04.507 --> 29:06.624
because your granddaughter's
in school right now.

29:06.626 --> 29:07.925
Well, I might have

29:07.927 --> 29:10.061
taken her out of school
a little bit early.

29:10.063 --> 29:11.512
Early?

29:11.514 --> 29:12.463
Yes, but

29:12.465 --> 29:14.232
in my defense,
we were doing

29:14.234 --> 29:15.733
something very
educational.

29:15.735 --> 29:16.734
We were
learning

29:16.736 --> 29:18.519
how to apply
foundation.

29:18.521 --> 29:20.221
Apply foundation...

29:20.223 --> 29:22.039
I don't know what that means.

29:22.041 --> 29:24.041
We got makeovers.

29:24.043 --> 29:26.110
Oh, you had makeovers!
Uh-huh.

29:26.112 --> 29:27.245
Like with makeup
on everybody's faces.

29:27.247 --> 29:29.747
Well, yes, that's how
you usually do it.

29:29.749 --> 29:32.166
Can you do me a favor and send
a picture of my daughter to me?

29:32.168 --> 29:33.334
Right now, please?
On the telephone?

29:33.336 --> 29:34.569
Okay.

29:34.571 --> 29:36.370
Coming
right up.

29:36.372 --> 29:37.922
Okay, he wants
a picture.

29:41.760 --> 29:43.661
Okay, say "YOLO."
YOLO.

29:43.663 --> 29:44.679
You're so pretty.

29:44.681 --> 29:46.130
Thank you.

29:46.132 --> 29:47.131
Got it?

29:48.117 --> 29:50.168
Oh, God...

29:50.170 --> 29:51.385
Oh, relax.

29:51.387 --> 29:52.937
No, Ma, you relax.

29:52.939 --> 29:54.689
Nice retort, sweetheart.

29:54.691 --> 29:55.840
Okay, look.

29:55.842 --> 29:58.359
Um... Operation, uh,
Corrupt My Daughter

29:58.361 --> 29:59.861
is now officially over.

29:59.863 --> 30:02.144
I'd like you two to come home
now, please, if that's okay.

30:19.331 --> 30:20.715
Thanks for coming.

30:20.717 --> 30:23.251
Change your mind
about going on record?

30:24.803 --> 30:26.053
No.

30:26.055 --> 30:28.222
I'm afraid
not, Sean.

30:28.224 --> 30:30.725
Listen, I know what
happened in Chicago,

30:30.727 --> 30:32.009
all right?

30:32.011 --> 30:33.094
And your facts
may be right.

30:33.096 --> 30:34.862
But you're-you're
way off base

30:34.864 --> 30:36.314
about Captain Grover.
He's a good man,

30:36.316 --> 30:38.048
and he's a great cop.
Who made

30:38.050 --> 30:39.734
the wrong call and
got a little boy killed.

30:39.736 --> 30:41.936
I'm-I'm
surprised

30:41.938 --> 30:43.821
by your support
for him, Commander.

30:43.823 --> 30:45.273
One of the
first things

30:45.275 --> 30:46.524
that Grover did when
he rode into town

30:46.526 --> 30:47.575
was file a grievance
against you.

30:47.577 --> 30:49.777
Which was withdraw.
So, what?

30:49.779 --> 30:52.029
You-you owe him a favor, now?
No, that's not how it works.

30:52.031 --> 30:53.898
Why are you
defending him?

30:53.900 --> 30:55.266
I don't get you.
You don't get me.

30:55.268 --> 30:56.467
No, you don't
get me.

30:56.469 --> 30:59.503
You non-operators,
you sit on the sidelines

30:59.505 --> 31:00.838
and you judge us
in the field.

31:00.840 --> 31:02.340
You have no idea
what it's like.

31:02.342 --> 31:03.925
The hard decisions

31:03.927 --> 31:05.209
we have to make
every day

31:05.211 --> 31:07.879
going downrange,
and the consequences

31:07.881 --> 31:09.246
that we have to
live with forever.

31:09.248 --> 31:10.431
Are you speaking
for Captain Grover,

31:10.433 --> 31:11.849
or are you speaking
for yourself?

31:11.851 --> 31:15.353
I'm speaking for anyone
who's ever had to do this job.

31:17.139 --> 31:19.440
I'm also asking you...

31:19.442 --> 31:21.309
leave this one alone, huh?

31:30.152 --> 31:31.268
Hi.

31:31.270 --> 31:32.570
Go ahead.

31:33.790 --> 31:35.156
Go wash your
face right now.

31:35.158 --> 31:36.123
Are you mad,
Danno?

31:36.125 --> 31:38.159
No, I'm not mad.
Do I look mad?

31:39.044 --> 31:40.828
Go.

31:40.830 --> 31:42.463
Come on in.
I'm sorry.

31:42.465 --> 31:43.998
I just wanted to go
have a little fun

31:44.000 --> 31:44.949
with my granddaughter.

31:44.951 --> 31:46.167
Got it.
It's fine.

31:46.169 --> 31:48.636
Ma...
that's fine.

31:48.638 --> 31:49.804
Here's what I don't get.

31:49.806 --> 31:51.956
I don't get how it is
that you are having fun.

31:51.958 --> 31:52.974
It doesn't make
sense to me.

31:52.976 --> 31:53.958
I mean,

31:53.960 --> 31:54.959
you're dancing
in the kitchen,

31:54.961 --> 31:56.060
you're singing
songs,

31:56.062 --> 31:57.261
you're doing makeovers,

31:57.263 --> 31:58.462
going to the pool,
having a blast.

31:58.464 --> 31:59.964
I mean, I... I'm confused.

31:59.966 --> 32:01.632
Aren't-aren't you upset?
Aren't you sad?

32:01.634 --> 32:04.185
Of course I'm sad.

32:04.187 --> 32:05.353
You think because I have

32:05.355 --> 32:06.821
a song stuck in my head

32:06.823 --> 32:08.689
that I'm not sad?
I don't know.

32:08.691 --> 32:11.275
I want to cry
all the time, honey.

32:14.247 --> 32:16.313
I'm sorry I took
Grace out of school.

32:16.315 --> 32:17.615
It's just, when
you left for work,

32:17.617 --> 32:20.835
I found myself
extremely lonely here,

32:20.837 --> 32:22.987
and wandering around
with nothing to do.

32:22.989 --> 32:24.005
Okay.

32:24.007 --> 32:25.589
I already said that's fine.
Okay.

32:25.591 --> 32:28.159
Ma, can we
talk now? Please?

32:29.795 --> 32:33.881
Ever since your father retired,

32:33.883 --> 32:37.334
he has a million
different hobbies

32:37.336 --> 32:39.353
and-and interests.

32:39.355 --> 32:41.305
And not one of them

32:41.307 --> 32:42.556
involves being with me.

32:42.558 --> 32:45.092
You're here
with Gracie,

32:45.094 --> 32:46.644
Matt's on the run somewhere,

32:46.646 --> 32:47.945
the girls are busy
with their own families,

32:47.947 --> 32:50.364
and I went
from being

32:50.366 --> 32:51.766
the busiest woman
in the world,

32:51.768 --> 32:53.818
raising you guys,

32:53.820 --> 32:55.236
cooking, cleaning,

32:55.238 --> 32:57.455
couponing, PTA-ing,

32:57.457 --> 33:00.291
to having absolutely nothing
but time on my hands.

33:00.293 --> 33:03.160
All right, so maybe
you need a hobby, too, you know.

33:03.162 --> 33:05.195
No, I don't
need a hobby,

33:05.197 --> 33:06.464
sweetheart,
I need a life.

33:06.466 --> 33:07.665
Like a real life.

33:07.667 --> 33:11.802
A life with love and romance
and companionship.

33:13.555 --> 33:17.508
Please don't think
that I did not try

33:17.510 --> 33:19.477
to make this
marriage work.

33:19.479 --> 33:22.013
I never worked harder
at anything in my life.

33:23.181 --> 33:26.267
And I know this is
hurting you, but...

33:26.985 --> 33:28.319
No, Mom, it's-it's...

33:28.321 --> 33:30.271
Yeah. No,
I know it is.

33:30.273 --> 33:33.107
And I know that
it doesn't really matter

33:33.109 --> 33:36.060
how old you are or how much your
dad and I love you,

33:36.062 --> 33:38.345
it's still a tough
thing for you to handle,

33:38.347 --> 33:40.498
the thought of us being apart.

33:40.500 --> 33:42.232
And I am so sorry for that.

33:42.234 --> 33:47.004
Okay, well, I appreciate
that, Mom. I do.

33:47.006 --> 33:48.756
I apologize myself.

33:48.758 --> 33:52.293
I obviously have not been
very supportive, okay?

33:52.295 --> 33:54.578
But just so you know, uh,

33:54.580 --> 33:58.883
the hardest day of my life
was not when Rachel told me

33:58.885 --> 34:01.085
that she was leaving me, okay?
It was when

34:01.087 --> 34:02.753
we had to sit down
and tell Grace.

34:02.755 --> 34:03.854
That was, that was tough,

34:03.856 --> 34:06.256
you know?

34:06.258 --> 34:08.609
And she, you know,
she-she-she tried not to cry.

34:08.610 --> 34:11.429
And she was, you know,
trying to be big about it,

34:11.431 --> 34:15.699
but I know that, uh,
that we were

34:15.701 --> 34:18.069
her anchor, just like
you and Pop are to me.

34:18.071 --> 34:21.038
That's-that's tough
thinking about losing that,

34:21.040 --> 34:22.656
so...

34:22.658 --> 34:24.958
I know.
I'm sorry.

34:24.960 --> 34:26.827
Don't be sorry.

34:27.879 --> 34:29.880
Hey. So, I was doing
a little digging

34:29.882 --> 34:32.132
on the chain of custody
of our missing weapon.

34:32.135 --> 34:33.283
Where is it?

34:33.284 --> 34:34.635
Well, I'll tell you
where it's not.

34:34.637 --> 34:35.920
Melted into scrap metal,

34:35.922 --> 34:37.621
which is what was supposed to happen
seven months ago

34:37.623 --> 34:39.790
when the prosecuting
attorney's office put through the order.

34:39.792 --> 34:43.177
Duke had no idea because
the P.A.'s office misfiled the paperwork.

34:44.929 --> 34:46.647
Okay, so somewhere between
the evidence room

34:46.649 --> 34:48.649
and the metalworks,
that .22 just disappeared.

34:48.650 --> 34:51.985
And whoever got their hands
on it killed Guy Ingram.

34:53.572 --> 34:55.639
<i>We cross-check</i>
<i>the serial numbers</i>

34:55.641 --> 34:57.024
to the police report number,

34:57.025 --> 35:00.027
then they're put into a bin
and wheeled down to our smelter

35:00.029 --> 35:01.862
where they're melted down
at 3,100 degrees.

35:01.864 --> 35:03.664
Done and done.
Well, maybe you can

35:03.666 --> 35:05.282
explain how a weapon
that was supposed

35:05.284 --> 35:08.586
to be destroyed by you ended up being
used in a homicide six months ago?

35:08.588 --> 35:10.588
No idea.

35:10.590 --> 35:12.239
But here's the paperwork.

35:18.329 --> 35:20.514
Whose signature is on
these receipt vouchers?

35:20.516 --> 35:21.899
George Moku.

35:21.901 --> 35:23.918
He's the yard boss.

35:23.920 --> 35:25.836
How long has he worked
for you?

35:25.838 --> 35:27.938
Ever since I married
his sister.

35:30.525 --> 35:31.859
You trust your
brother-in-law, Mr. Chan?

35:31.861 --> 35:34.378
He's family.
I don't have a choice.

35:34.380 --> 35:37.932
I'll take that
as an undecided.

35:37.934 --> 35:39.867
Here's what I'm thinking:
your brother-in-law George

35:39.869 --> 35:41.619
has a nice little side
business going on.

35:41.621 --> 35:43.454
He tags the guns
as destroyed, and then

35:43.456 --> 35:45.206
resells them on the street

35:45.208 --> 35:47.575
as untraceable.
I don't believe this.

35:47.577 --> 35:49.844
Well, you better believe it
'cause it's happening.

35:49.846 --> 35:51.245
Now where do we find him?

35:51.247 --> 35:52.963
He's called in sick today.

35:52.965 --> 35:54.865
Let me guess.
That happens every time

35:54.867 --> 35:57.284
a shipment of weapons
comes in to be destroyed.

35:58.970 --> 36:01.705
They're all clean.
Untraceable.

36:01.707 --> 36:04.892
So what do you say?
You see something you like?

36:08.731 --> 36:11.148
Hey, what the hell's going on?!
Bruddah, are you setting us up?

36:11.150 --> 36:13.901
Hey, I swear,
there's nothing going on.

36:13.903 --> 36:15.886
Look for yourself.

36:15.888 --> 36:17.354
Don't move.
Stay where you are.

36:36.324 --> 36:38.459
Have I mentioned
it's good to have you back?

36:43.632 --> 36:45.916
Don't worry.
The wound, you'll survive.

36:45.918 --> 36:48.469
But a life sentence in Halawa,
that's a different story.

36:48.471 --> 36:51.639
Life? I just repurposed
those weapons

36:51.641 --> 36:54.358
to the good folks of Oahu
looking to protect themselves.

36:54.360 --> 36:57.478
You sold this .22
six months ago. I want a name.

36:57.480 --> 36:59.146
Come on, lady,
I'm shot here.

37:05.655 --> 37:07.771
What the hell are you doing?!
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

37:07.773 --> 37:09.857
don't worry, George, we're not
gonna let you bleed to death.

37:09.859 --> 37:11.158
We're just gonna let it
get to the point

37:11.160 --> 37:12.609
where the damage to your arm
is so bad,

37:12.611 --> 37:14.611
they're gonna
have to amputate.

37:14.613 --> 37:16.113
You can't do this!

37:16.115 --> 37:17.798
You can't shoot at cops either,
but you did.

37:17.800 --> 37:21.919
If I give you a name, will you
take me to the hospital?

37:21.921 --> 37:24.305
Start talking, George.

37:31.596 --> 37:33.597
Gerard Burns
the defense attorney?

37:33.599 --> 37:35.266
Guy's made a lot of money
representing

37:35.268 --> 37:36.300
some questionable people.

37:36.302 --> 37:37.651
Doesn't make sense.
Why would

37:37.653 --> 37:40.571
he buy a gun to kill Guy Ingram?
What's the connection?

37:40.573 --> 37:42.740
Burns' wife.

37:42.742 --> 37:44.341
Meet Sally Ann Burns.

37:44.343 --> 37:46.660
But we know her better
as Sally Ann Caldwell.

37:46.662 --> 37:49.079
The name on the other
plane ticket.

37:49.081 --> 37:51.315
The reason we couldn't find her
is because she hasn't used

37:51.317 --> 37:53.334
her maiden name
in over 20 years.

37:53.336 --> 37:55.836
So Guy Ingram and Burns' wife
were gonna run away together.

37:55.838 --> 37:58.372
Burns must've found out and
made sure that didn't happen.

37:58.374 --> 38:00.324
All right, how do we get
to Sally Ann?

38:00.326 --> 38:01.375
We don't.

38:01.377 --> 38:04.078
Burns reported her missing
six months ago.

38:19.768 --> 38:21.135
Well, it's about time.

38:21.137 --> 38:23.688
Do you know how long I've been
sitting in this box?

38:23.690 --> 38:25.189
We're sorry
to pull you off

38:25.191 --> 38:26.657
the golf course,
Mr. Burns.

38:26.659 --> 38:29.026
Although, it <i>did</i> look
like you were down a few strokes.

38:29.028 --> 38:30.828
The first rule when you're
playing with clients,

38:30.830 --> 38:32.246
Lieutenant, let 'em beat you.

38:32.248 --> 38:34.331
It's a good way to win
friends and influence people.

38:34.333 --> 38:35.616
Hmm.

38:35.618 --> 38:37.118
We know you bought a gun

38:37.120 --> 38:39.837
from George Moku
seven months ago. And we know

38:39.839 --> 38:41.872
you used that gun
to murder Guy Ingram.

38:41.874 --> 38:44.258
the hell
are you talking about?

38:44.260 --> 38:47.378
We know that your wife, Sally,
was having an affair with Guy.

38:47.380 --> 38:49.463
And now he's dead
and she's missing.

38:49.465 --> 38:51.265
You see, we got Moku
in custody,

38:51.267 --> 38:53.050
and he's signing
his statement right now.

38:53.052 --> 38:55.553
So what if I buy a gun
from Mr. Moku?

38:55.555 --> 38:59.690
That gun was stolen from my home
before my wife disappeared.

39:02.694 --> 39:07.031
You know, our HPD crime scene
guys don't get enough credit.

39:08.183 --> 39:10.234
They really do amazing work.

39:10.236 --> 39:12.053
In fact, they do
such amazing work,

39:12.055 --> 39:16.657
that they recovered dozens of
fingerprints, yes, from behind

39:16.659 --> 39:19.276
plaster wall where
you hid Ingram's body.

39:21.329 --> 39:24.131
So, okay, counselor,
you know how this works.

39:24.133 --> 39:25.966
We take your fingerprints
and we compare 'em

39:25.968 --> 39:28.085
to the ones we found
at the crime scene.

39:28.087 --> 39:31.472
And my guess guess is that's not
gonna work out for you so well.

39:35.376 --> 39:37.044
You know...

39:37.046 --> 39:40.231
she said there was nothing
between the two of them.

39:40.233 --> 39:42.399
I knew she was lying.

39:44.385 --> 39:46.403
Where's your wife, Gerard?

39:47.572 --> 39:49.740
She's exactly where
she should be.

39:51.109 --> 39:52.610
What are you saying?

39:52.612 --> 39:55.746
She wanted to spend eternity
with her lover,

39:55.748 --> 39:57.865
so I gave her that.

40:22.423 --> 40:23.774
Book him.

40:35.855 --> 40:37.521
Hey, you okay?

40:37.523 --> 40:40.457
I just wanted to come by
and say thank you.

40:41.609 --> 40:43.210
What are you talking about?

40:43.212 --> 40:44.461
Oh, come on.
Stop playing.

40:44.463 --> 40:46.213
I just talked to the guy.
He says

40:46.215 --> 40:47.331
he's gonna pull
the story.

40:47.333 --> 40:48.616
Well, there you go.
Congratulations.

40:48.618 --> 40:50.134
So what'd it cost you?

40:50.136 --> 40:52.636
I just appealed
to his better angels.

40:52.638 --> 40:55.089
And when that didn't work,
then what did you do?

40:56.424 --> 40:58.309
I told him I'd owe him one.

40:58.311 --> 40:59.610
Quid pro quo.

40:59.612 --> 41:01.461
Yeah. You know,

41:01.463 --> 41:04.131
that's gonna come around
and bite you in the ass, right?

41:04.133 --> 41:05.399
Ah, maybe.

41:05.401 --> 41:07.467
That's a problem
for another day, though, right?

41:09.638 --> 41:11.188
Listen, man, I, uh,

41:11.190 --> 41:13.240
I really appreciate you
telling me about Chicago.

41:15.143 --> 41:18.612
Well, perhaps someday you'll
tell me why you came back home.

41:20.315 --> 41:22.750
Yeah, someday.

41:45.724 --> 41:47.141
Ma?
Mm...

41:47.143 --> 41:48.609
Ma?
Yeah?

41:48.611 --> 41:50.544
You should get up
and go to bed.

41:50.546 --> 41:52.947
I'm watching <i>Housewives.</i>

41:54.366 --> 41:56.650
Ah, I see.

41:56.652 --> 41:57.801
Okay,

41:57.803 --> 41:59.787
you stay here.
Thank you.

41:59.789 --> 42:01.222
Sleep good.

42:01.224 --> 42:03.490
Night.

42:03.492 --> 42:04.975
Night. I love you, Daniel.

42:06.194 --> 42:07.795
Love you, too, Mom.

42:18.089 --> 42:20.758
Hey.

42:20.760 --> 42:21.976
Busted.

42:21.978 --> 42:25.246
Just to the end of this chapter,
please?

42:25.248 --> 42:26.513
No-no-no-no-no.

42:26.515 --> 42:28.482
Much as I like
to see you read,

42:28.484 --> 42:30.550
it is way past
your bedtime, all right?

42:30.552 --> 42:32.853
Give me the flashlight.

42:32.855 --> 42:35.555
Anybody else in here?

42:35.557 --> 42:37.074
I hope not.

42:37.076 --> 42:38.442
Yeah, me, too.

42:42.364 --> 42:45.616
Good? Yeah?

42:47.202 --> 42:48.802
Hey, um...

42:49.921 --> 42:51.255
...you remember when, uh,

42:51.257 --> 42:55.376
when me and your mom, we sat you
down and told you

42:55.378 --> 42:56.994
we weren't gonna be married
anymore?

42:58.163 --> 43:00.914
I'm really sorry
I had to put you through that.

43:00.916 --> 43:02.433
I know it was tough.

43:02.435 --> 43:04.168
I know it was hard for you,
Daddy.

43:04.170 --> 43:06.603
Hard for me?
No, what do you mean?

43:06.605 --> 43:08.889
How do you know anything?
You were just a little kid.

43:08.891 --> 43:13.093
I remember after you told me,

43:13.095 --> 43:17.698
you went to your room,
and I could hear you crying.

43:22.320 --> 43:24.705
You know, if you, uh,
if you got the time,

43:24.707 --> 43:26.707
I don't know, maybe one
of those special hugs.

43:26.709 --> 43:28.042
I could use it
right now.

43:28.044 --> 43:29.209
Yeah, thanks.

43:29.211 --> 43:31.445
Thank you.
Oh, thank you for that, too.
