<i> [narrator] throughout nome,</i>
<i>  the end of winter looms.</i>

00:16.250 --> 00:18.951
Holy [bleep].
Look at that crack.

00:19.987 --> 00:22.121
<i> [narrator] it's a battle</i>
<i>  to see which is hotter:</i>

00:22.423 --> 00:24.790
<i>  The soaring temperatures...</i>

00:24.792 --> 00:28.660
It could go really bad,
but hell,
we're gold mining.

00:28.662 --> 00:29.762
<i> [narrator] ...Or the miners...</i>

00:29.764 --> 00:33.265
This is what we have to do
right now to get gold today.

00:34.735 --> 00:37.803
<i> [narrator] ...As they tap in</i>
<i>  to the richest gold</i>
<i>  of the season?</i>

00:37.805 --> 00:40.939
-I think there's gold
through this whole area.
-All right!

00:40.941 --> 00:43.709
You get a good horse,
ride it, baby, ride it.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.144
You seeing any color?

00:45.146 --> 00:47.346
Yeah. We could lean in
to really hot gold.

00:49.750 --> 00:50.382
[screams]

00:52.820 --> 00:53.986
pull in! Pull in, pull in!

00:53.988 --> 00:56.055
[screaming]

01:11.172 --> 01:13.238
<i> [kris] holy [bleep], huh?</i>

01:14.542 --> 01:15.441
We are sinking.

01:17.812 --> 01:20.712
Mother nature is not
cooperating with me.

01:20.714 --> 01:23.849
<i> [narrator] while winter</i>
<i>  melts away, the kellys</i>
<i>  find themselves</i>

01:23.851 --> 01:26.852
<i>  out of debt,</i>
<i>  but still underwater.</i>

01:26.854 --> 01:28.720
<i> [kris] there's so much</i>
<i> [bleep] snow on the ice,</i>

01:28.722 --> 01:33.792
<i>  it's pushing us down,</i>
<i>  and the water's coming up.</i>

01:33.794 --> 01:38.297
So first, the good news.
After a mostly crappy season,
we're ending strong.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.598
<i>  I have a beautiful baby girl.</i>

01:39.600 --> 01:43.368
We're on great gold,
and it's all profit
the rest of the way.

01:43.370 --> 01:46.839
<i>  The bad news?</i>
<i>  This warm weather</i>
<i>  is making the snow wet,</i>

01:46.841 --> 01:50.576
<i>  and it's weighing down</i>
<i>  the ice, meaning water's</i>
<i>  bursting up through the ice.</i>

01:50.578 --> 01:54.680
It's like a hawaii out here.
It's a [bleep] show.

01:54.682 --> 01:58.750
Well right now, I just popped
a hole into where
my foot valves go,

01:58.752 --> 02:01.553
and the water is pumping
right out the hole,
on top of the ice,

02:01.555 --> 02:03.989
because the weight of the snow
is pushing the ice down,

02:03.991 --> 02:06.959
and then the water rushes
through once you break
a hole through.

02:06.961 --> 02:08.694
We're gonna flood
this entire area.

02:08.696 --> 02:12.397
Just keep going.
There's nothing we can do.
We just have to push forward.

02:12.399 --> 02:16.368
<i>  This is what we have to do</i>
<i>  right now to get gold today.</i>

02:17.738 --> 02:20.806
<i>  Look, it's clear we're</i>
<i>  running out of time</i>
<i>  this season.</i>

02:20.808 --> 02:22.975
But we're finally getting gold
for ourself.

02:22.977 --> 02:24.276
This gold is ours now.

02:24.278 --> 02:26.945
<i>  There's nothing left</i>
<i>  to pay back at this point.</i>

02:26.947 --> 02:29.581
<i>  So we have to keep</i>
<i> clearing out the water, to get</i>
<i>  as much gold as we can,</i>

02:29.583 --> 02:34.019
and hope to god our operation
doesn't fall through the ice.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.789
<i> We're sending down andy first,</i>
<i>  'cause he was already</i>
<i>  on the gold.</i>

02:37.791 --> 02:40.893
<i>  He's gonna mow up as much</i>
<i>  as he can, then I'm gonna go</i>
<i>  down there</i>

02:40.895 --> 02:43.829
<i>  and just take over my shift,</i>
<i>  and mow up the rest.</i>

02:43.831 --> 02:45.164
Are these conditions
dangerous?

02:45.166 --> 02:48.033
Yes. That's why my dad
slipped on the ice
and broke his shoulder.

02:48.035 --> 02:52.738
So we're short-staffed
to boot, but we have
no choice. I need that gold.

02:52.740 --> 02:53.405
My baby needs that gold.

02:53.407 --> 02:55.807
My baby's expensive.

02:55.809 --> 03:00.078
You know what to do.
Get down there. Try to cover
as much ground as you can.

03:00.915 --> 03:02.414
Good. We're ready to go.

03:02.416 --> 03:05.050
Okay, go. Make me money!

03:09.690 --> 03:13.992

03:20.000 --> 03:22.067
<i> [andy] all right. Idle up.</i>
<i>  Let's see.</i>

03:22.069 --> 03:23.168
<i> [kris] okay.</i>

03:23.370 --> 03:25.170
Idle up!

03:31.178 --> 03:34.913
And now it's really gonna
flood, now that we have
the engines up.

03:34.915 --> 03:38.917
<i>  And I don't feel safe</i>
<i>  with so much water being</i>
<i>  pumped on top of the ice.</i>

03:38.919 --> 03:40.986
Hopefully it holds.

03:41.989 --> 03:44.256
Fast as I get it out,
it comes in.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.092
It's gonna be a long day.

03:47.094 --> 03:49.194
It's gonna be a fight
the whole way through.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.233

03:57.004 --> 03:58.170
<i> [kris] idled up.</i>

03:58.772 --> 04:00.239
<i> [andy] all right. Thank you.</i>

04:08.949 --> 04:10.349
So are you
seeing gold already?

04:12.720 --> 04:13.952
<i>  Yeah.</i>

04:18.125 --> 04:19.858
<i> [kris] okay, good job.</i>

04:19.860 --> 04:21.393
[andy speaking]

04:30.304 --> 04:30.936
oh, thank god.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.404
That is such great news.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.674
[andy speaking]

04:35.676 --> 04:38.877
all right, andy. That's all
that I care about.

04:38.879 --> 04:42.180
[bleep] the snow.
[bleep] the water. As long as
the gold looks great.

04:42.182 --> 04:45.917
[andy speaking]

04:45.919 --> 04:47.953
<i> [kris] all right, buddy!</i>
<i>  I'm glad you're</i>
<i>  in a better mood.</i>

04:47.955 --> 04:50.188
[andy speaking]

04:51.458 --> 04:53.025
<i> [kris] okay, 10-4.</i>

04:53.027 --> 04:55.927
Andy's found gold. So I'm
gonna be down right after.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.030
We're gonna save
our entire season.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.065
That's a miracle.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.201
<i> [narrator] 11 miles east...</i>

05:13.881 --> 05:15.614
<i> [vernon] I mean, let's just</i>
<i>  go ahead and set a goal.</i>

05:15.616 --> 05:19.084
You almost clocked in
six hours the other day.

05:19.086 --> 05:21.720
I'd think you could probably
shoot for eight.
What do you think?

05:21.722 --> 05:24.122
Yeah, I think I can definitely
easily do eight.

05:24.124 --> 05:28.560
Okay, well, I...
If you can do eight,
that'll be a, um, record.

05:28.562 --> 05:32.731
<i> [narrator] on scorching</i>
<i>  hot gold, but nearing</i>
<i> an expiration date on the ice,</i>

05:32.733 --> 05:36.401
<i>  vernon adkison's launching</i>
<i>  a dive for the ages.</i>

05:37.604 --> 05:40.572
[vernon] all right,
the gold marathon.

05:40.574 --> 05:42.908
This has been a winter
to remember.

05:42.910 --> 05:46.378
But this winter is not gonna
be around much longer.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.146
<i>  We're playing with fire.</i>

05:48.148 --> 05:50.549
<i>  We're right up against</i>
<i>  a massive open water lead,</i>

05:50.551 --> 05:53.318
<i>  and it's getting wider</i>
<i>  every day.</i>

05:53.320 --> 05:56.555
<i>  At this point, every minute</i>
<i>  under the ice is critical.</i>

05:56.557 --> 06:02.060
So, even though it's getting
toasty up here, I'm looking
to heat up production.

06:02.062 --> 06:05.330
All right, so uh, give me
at least eight hours in,
I'll be happy.

06:05.332 --> 06:06.732
Okay, will do.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.633
-All right. Well, here,
we'll even shake on that.
-All right.

06:08.635 --> 06:12.738
Okay, good show.
Be careful down there.

06:12.740 --> 06:16.942
We're looking to set
a team record
for the longest dive today.

06:16.944 --> 06:19.878
<i> The longest one we've ever had</i>
<i> was a little over seven hours,</i>

06:19.880 --> 06:22.013
so I'm gunning for eight.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.815
[crew member] yeah, that looks
good right there.

06:23.817 --> 06:27.386
Good suction, good flow
in the box.

06:27.388 --> 06:30.355
He's set, and he's ready
to rock and roll.

06:30.357 --> 06:33.859
<i> [vernon] we need it,</i>
<i>  if I'm gonna hit</i>
<i>  my 200 ounces.</i>

06:33.861 --> 06:38.296

and that lead, this might be
the last tango.

<i>  So far, so good.</i>

You're all hydrated. You got
plenty of chow this morning.

07:10.063 --> 07:13.965

you can go the distance?

07:13.967 --> 07:14.966

07:14.968 --> 07:16.802
<i> [gary] yeah, I think I can.</i>
<i>  I know I can.</i>

<i>  Whoo!</i>

07:26.079 --> 07:27.979
All right, all right!

07:29.683 --> 07:32.784
<i>  So far, it seems</i>
<i>  like everything's working.</i>

07:32.786 --> 07:34.653
He's down there
picking away at it.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.922
<i>  Oh! Whoo!</i>

07:36.924 --> 07:43.128
We're gonna dive him hard.
If he can do eight hours,
I got a new name for him.

07:43.497 --> 07:46.431
He'll be "the gold gorilla."

07:46.433 --> 07:49.401
and I can just shorten that.
We'll call him "goldrilla."

07:51.438 --> 07:53.738
<i> [gary] there's gold back here.</i>

07:53.740 --> 07:59.211
Hang on, gary. We're gonna
rename you. You'll be
"gary the gold gorilla."

07:59.213 --> 08:01.012
[gary]

<i> [shawn] we got the pad</i>
<i>  built up. And we got</i>
<i>  everything moved over.</i>

08:23.804 --> 08:26.605

down there or not.

08:26.607 --> 08:29.441

08:41.622 --> 08:43.755
<i> [shawn] putting</i>
<i>  all this weight on the ice,</i>

<i>  and now it's starting</i>
<i>  to crack. Holy [bleep]!</i>

08:48.061 --> 08:49.961
Look at that crack there.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.197
[bleep] damn.

08:53.467 --> 08:55.400
<i>  I'm still not where</i>
<i>  I need to be.</i>

08:55.402 --> 08:58.503
I need another 30 ounces
to meet my 120 ounces gold,

08:58.505 --> 09:01.039
so I can make all
of my payments
that I owe.

09:01.575 --> 09:04.042
<i>  I'm still looking</i>
<i> for good gold on this jackpot.</i>

09:04.044 --> 09:06.378
<i>  I'm close, but I want</i>
<i>  to hit the bull's-eye.</i>

09:06.380 --> 09:07.979
<i>  That's what I'm after.</i>

09:07.981 --> 09:12.050
Problem is,
the gold's getting hotter,
but the temperature is, too.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.386
And I'm worried there's not
enough time left.

09:16.390 --> 09:17.989
Oh, [bleep].

09:18.358 --> 09:20.025
Damn it, already.

09:21.562 --> 09:26.431
Basically, we've cracked
the ice in a complete circle
around us.

09:29.202 --> 09:32.938
So we're just sitting
on this, uh... Sitting
on a chunk of ice...

09:32.940 --> 09:35.040
Floating in the middle
of the bering sea.

09:35.809 --> 09:40.712
It could go really bad,
but hell,
we're gold mining.

09:40.714 --> 09:44.849
Nobody said it was gonna be
a safe job.

09:44.851 --> 09:47.719
<i>  So, time to get in the water.</i>

09:47.721 --> 09:50.689
We're literally on an island
right now.

09:50.691 --> 09:53.892
<i>  We're floating on a circle</i>
<i>  of ice that's broken off</i>

09:53.894 --> 09:55.860
<i>  from the weight</i>
<i>  of the equipment and snow.</i>

09:55.862 --> 09:57.996
<i>  And it keeps getting</i>
<i>  weaker and weaker.</i>

09:57.998 --> 10:00.799
At any time,
it's gonna collapse.

10:00.801 --> 10:04.970
<i>  So the plan's simple.</i>
<i>  Mine as much as we can,</i>
<i>  as fast as we can.</i>

10:04.972 --> 10:06.237
Double dive day.

10:06.840 --> 10:07.806
<i>  I'll go first.</i>

10:07.808 --> 10:09.774
<i>  Joe'll go after me.</i>

<i>  As the sand comes up,</i>

<i>  Usually, it's hot right here.</i>

11:05.565 --> 11:07.799
[joe]
hell yeah, sounds good.

11:07.801 --> 11:10.335

12:25.779 --> 12:28.780
<i>  while the weather is nice.</i>

12:28.782 --> 12:31.216
<i>  It's turning into</i>
<i>  a giant swimming pool</i>
<i>  out here.</i>

12:31.218 --> 12:32.584
<i>  It's crazy how warm</i>
<i>  it's getting.</i>

12:32.586 --> 12:35.386
To make things even worse,
we lost steve riedel.

12:35.388 --> 12:40.391
<i> He wasn't making enough money,</i>
<i>  so he decided to split.</i>

12:40.393 --> 12:44.362
<i>  Luckily, we've got our friend</i>
<i>  shlomo here to help get us</i>
<i>  across the finish line.</i>

12:47.234 --> 12:47.766
Oh, yeah!

12:47.768 --> 12:51.169
Look at that! Yeah!

12:59.880 --> 13:02.213
Right now,
we barely have enough time
to get eight ounces,

13:02.215 --> 13:04.516
and keep the operation going.

13:04.518 --> 13:08.086
<i>  Our last time out,</i>
<i>  we'd finally got on</i>
<i>  some really great gold.</i>

13:08.088 --> 13:13.024
So I just gotta get back on it
fast and make sure that
nothing slows us down,

13:13.026 --> 13:15.059
'cause that could be
the nail in the coffin.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.272
[breathing]

13:32.646 --> 13:33.878
you ready for the pumps?

13:33.880 --> 13:35.280
<i> [zeke on radio] uh, yeah,</i>
<i>  ready.</i>

13:36.917 --> 13:38.249
[gabe] okay. Here they come.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.286
Yo!

13:48.128 --> 13:49.327
All right, you're chilling.

13:54.568 --> 13:56.234
[breathing]

13:59.906 --> 14:02.207
<i> [zeke] we're like, on top</i>
<i>  of a ton of cobble.</i>

14:04.911 --> 14:06.978
<i> [gabe] all right. Roger.</i>

14:07.380 --> 14:09.214
You might run into
something hot.

14:10.250 --> 14:13.251
[zeke]
<i>  yeah, it like, could lead</i>
<i>  into really hot gold.</i>

14:15.388 --> 14:18.022
<i> [gabe] it's got a lot</i>
<i>  of radius, so we can punch</i>
<i>  a bunch of holes,</i>

14:18.024 --> 14:22.527
and either pick up what he was
following in another spot,
or find something new.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.897
<i>  I don't know. Lots of cobble</i>
<i>  to work with, though. Lots</i>
<i>  of radius, lots of cobble.</i>

14:25.899 --> 14:29.000
So I'm optimistic that
he'll get on something.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.803
<i>  Stick and stay, make it pay.</i>

14:31.805 --> 14:33.972
<i> [zeke] yeah,</i>
<i>  we're making it happen.</i>

14:35.709 --> 14:37.242
<i> [narrator] one mile east...</i>

14:44.117 --> 14:45.884
[kris]
<i>  everything's still good?</i>

14:45.886 --> 14:49.854
<i> [andy] everything's great, j.</i>
<i>  Just a lot of really good</i>
<i>  gold. Everything is good.</i>

14:49.856 --> 14:51.890
Are you still
in that black [bleep]?

14:51.892 --> 14:53.424
[andy]
<i>  yeah, it's never-ending.</i>

14:54.561 --> 14:56.094
And the gold's never-ending?

14:56.096 --> 14:58.663
<i> [andy] the gold's not ending.</i>
<i>  That means</i>
<i>  kris'll make his bills.</i>

14:58.665 --> 15:01.866
[kris laughs]

15:01.868 --> 15:06.004
<i> [narrator] after fighting off</i>
<i>  debt all season, the kellys</i>
<i>  are out of the red...</i>

15:06.873 --> 15:08.406
<i>  And into the black.</i>

15:09.976 --> 15:13.311
Hey, you've been down there
a really long time.
You gotta be getting tired.

15:13.980 --> 15:17.415
[andy speaking]

15:19.486 --> 15:20.752
<i> [kris] are you ready</i>
<i>  to be done?</i>

15:20.754 --> 15:24.055
<i> [andy] yeah, I'm done.</i>
<i>  Yeah, my arms are tired.</i>

15:24.057 --> 15:26.591
<i> [kris] okay, come up.</i>
<i>  Your dive's done.</i>

15:26.593 --> 15:28.259
[breathing]

15:28.261 --> 15:31.796
I'm gonna go get changed.
James is gonna help andy
out of the hole.

15:31.798 --> 15:34.499
We're gonna get ready,
as soon as andy comes up,
I jump down there,

15:34.501 --> 15:36.968
and I do...
Dive as long as I can today.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.738
It was good. Really good gold
the whole time.

15:40.740 --> 15:43.174
Yeah, best gold I've seen
all season.

15:47.414 --> 15:50.248
Well, andy says we're
on some amazing gold...

15:50.483 --> 15:52.383
So let's go see.

15:54.888 --> 15:57.255
<i>  Judging by how quickly</i>
<i>  the area is flooding,</i>

15:57.257 --> 15:59.891
this could be our last day
on the ice.

15:59.893 --> 16:02.427
<i>  But you never know.</i>
<i>  The water's not flooding</i>
<i>  the shack yet.</i>

16:02.429 --> 16:06.030
<i>  We're on stellar gold,</i>
<i>  and there's no way</i>
<i>  we're packing it in yet.</i>

16:06.032 --> 16:09.000
You bet your ass
we're gonna keep pushing
as long as we can.

16:09.002 --> 16:10.969
-Okay.
-Okay.

16:13.039 --> 16:15.940
[breathing]

16:15.942 --> 16:17.241
<i>  okay.</i>

16:17.777 --> 16:19.210

16:20.981 --> 16:22.981
how's it look, j?

16:23.817 --> 16:26.184
[kris]
<i>  looks great already.</i>

16:26.553 --> 16:29.320
<i>  Yeah, it does. It gives us</i>
<i>  a lot of ground.</i>

16:31.358 --> 16:34.759
<i> [andy] hey, you see</i>
<i>  that black [bleep]</i>
<i>  I was sucking up?</i>

16:34.761 --> 16:37.161
[kris]
<i>  yeah, I'm just working</i>
<i>  the edges of it right now.</i>

16:38.465 --> 16:41.399
[kris speaking]

16:42.802 --> 16:45.436
I know there is. Wait 'til
you get to the deeper
black [bleep] .

16:45.438 --> 16:49.107
Man, it [bleep] trickles down
nice and says hi.

16:49.109 --> 16:52.210
<i> [kris] okay. Well,</i>
<i>  that's what I'm working on</i>
<i>  getting to. Right on.</i>

16:53.046 --> 16:53.911
Good stuff.

16:53.913 --> 16:56.447
We're on really good gold.
About time.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.983
<i>  Everything's dialed in. Hey.</i>

17:01.054 --> 17:04.422
<i> [kris] like I said,</i>
<i>  gold mining is luck.</i>

17:05.025 --> 17:06.357
You got that right.

17:09.129 --> 17:10.395
<i> [kris] yeah, baby!</i>

17:13.833 --> 17:16.300
[machine sputtering]

17:22.175 --> 17:25.076
-yeah, something's not right.
-Something's not right.

17:25.078 --> 17:28.179
-No, it's not. Might be, too,
something's not running.
-Something didn't sound right.

17:43.029 --> 17:45.997
[kris speaking]

18:00.013 --> 18:01.245
what was that, j?

18:18.832 --> 18:19.997
[kris screaming]

18:22.001 --> 18:24.001
pull in! Pull in, pull in!

18:37.750 --> 18:40.051
[kris screaming]

18:40.420 --> 18:42.220
pull in! Pull in, pull in!

18:42.722 --> 18:44.422
[strained breathing]

18:48.294 --> 18:50.027
we've got you.
You all right?

18:58.805 --> 19:03.341
I just had trouble breathing.
It wasn't, uh, plug-up,
thank god.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.576
You know, when I say,
"pull the umbilical," pull it!

19:05.578 --> 19:07.612
I... I yanked it, and the guy
yanked back, and I was like...

19:07.614 --> 19:09.413
Well, you [bleep] pull on it,
then!

19:09.415 --> 19:12.016
I was pulling
myself out, [bleep]!

19:12.886 --> 19:14.519
Okay.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.988
We're having issues
with our air compressor.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.323
Every now and then, it's,
like, really hard to breathe.

19:21.060 --> 19:23.060
He said pull him up.
I told james to pull him up.

19:23.062 --> 19:27.131
And james pulled, and then
stopped, and then kris is
pulling the umbilical,

19:27.133 --> 19:28.966
trying to get out, so...

19:29.269 --> 19:29.700
...He's out.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.169
Okay, whatever.

19:33.373 --> 19:37.208
I put my mask on
too [bleep] tight.
I tried to put it on myself.

19:37.477 --> 19:38.943
I couldn't do it.

19:40.747 --> 19:43.648
Uh, nothing.
My air got [bleep] loose.
I tried to get back,

19:43.650 --> 19:45.650
my [bleep] umbilical was
stretched out...

19:45.652 --> 19:47.718
-Yeah.
-...And then I'm trying to get
someone to pull me back,

19:47.720 --> 19:51.822
and I'm pulling myself up,
and [bleep] over here let it
go back in!

19:51.824 --> 19:54.058
So I was just [bleep] pulling
to nowhere!

19:54.861 --> 19:56.427
Yes, that was what I thought.

20:03.736 --> 20:06.604
So yeah, that was kind of
a disaster.

20:06.606 --> 20:08.539
<i>  All this time, I'm worrying</i>
<i>  about getting flooded</i>

20:08.541 --> 20:11.475
<i>  and the operation falling</i>
<i>  through the ice. But instead,</i>

20:11.477 --> 20:15.580
the air compressor
and james being a moron
almost killed me.

20:15.582 --> 20:18.549
But hey, we got good gold
and the ice survived the day.

20:18.551 --> 20:21.352
So I'll call it a success,
with a minor asterisk.

20:22.155 --> 20:23.654
<i> [kris] I'm okay.</i>
<i>  Hey, everything's fine.</i>

20:23.656 --> 20:25.890
-I just was overtired...
-[andy] it's just
that air compressor.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.825
...And all of a sudden, I was
having trouble breathing.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.527
-I know.
-And when I have
trouble breathing,

20:29.529 --> 20:32.630
I'm not far away
from the hole,
and I'm super-tired,

20:32.632 --> 20:34.799
-I need to get the [bleep] out
of there.
-Sure.

20:34.801 --> 20:37.435
Anyway, let's pack
everything up. Let's go home.

20:40.373 --> 20:41.472
<i> [james] I've gotta pull</i>
<i>  the pole umbilical,</i>

20:41.474 --> 20:44.775
<i>  so to pull the umbilical,</i>
<i>  I've gotta yank back.</i>

20:44.777 --> 20:49.547
And, um, they always tell me
if, you know, they yank once,
that means they're fine.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.482
And if they yank twice,
pull 'em up.

20:51.484 --> 20:55.419
Sure as [bleep] was in,
you know, a little bit
of trouble, um,

20:55.421 --> 20:59.323
you know, I kind of panicked
a little bit, because, uh,
he was running out of air.

20:59.325 --> 21:01.492
Hey, let's go home.
I've had enough.

21:01.494 --> 21:04.729
Then it went green.
We got a lotta gold.
Pushed it to the limit.

21:04.731 --> 21:07.732
We worked a lot harder
than we should
of worked.

21:07.734 --> 21:10.001
Hopefully mom is cooking
something good.

21:18.011 --> 21:19.243
<i> [narrator] one mile west...</i>

you seeing any color?

21:27.120 --> 21:28.286

21:40.800 --> 21:42.133

21:43.836 --> 21:45.870
<i> [narrator] despite</i>

21:56.816 --> 22:00.818
And he's just gonna cut a line
and we're gonna
mow through all of it.

22:00.820 --> 22:05.122
You know, you gotta grind
and scratch it out,
and that's what we're doin'.

22:08.061 --> 22:09.293
[oxygen tank hissing]

22:13.099 --> 22:14.965
[generator thumping]

22:43.896 --> 22:47.131
[zeke speaking]

22:47.834 --> 22:49.433
[gabe]
okay. I'll be up top.

22:50.536 --> 22:53.404
[gabe speaking]

23:06.986 --> 23:10.454
I turned the generator off,
and then back on again,

23:10.456 --> 23:12.957
and it's starting
to warm up slowly,

23:12.959 --> 23:17.328
but it's, like,
pretty much lost all its heat,
but it's still running.

23:17.864 --> 23:19.230
[generator running]

23:23.603 --> 23:26.837
this is not what we need.
Not at all!

23:26.839 --> 23:29.907
<i>  We have almost no time left</i>
<i>  this season.</i>

23:29.909 --> 23:33.411
So, having to mess
with an equipment issue,
at this point,

23:33.413 --> 23:35.045
is a absolute killer.

23:45.124 --> 23:46.724
That's what it looks like.

23:47.193 --> 23:49.427
With the warm temperatures
we're having, there's a lot
of moisture in the air,

23:49.429 --> 23:51.495
and it gets sucked in
to all the generators

23:51.497 --> 23:54.498
and all the engines
and everything
that we're running.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.901
<i>  And because it's out</i>
<i>  in the sun, it froze up.</i>

23:56.903 --> 23:59.203
Hopefully, if I just blast it
with the blowtorch,

23:59.205 --> 24:01.272
it'll do the trick
and thaw it out.

24:04.277 --> 24:06.277
[generator running]

24:09.982 --> 24:11.081
perfect!

24:24.163 --> 24:25.629
Well, that was annoying,

24:25.665 --> 24:28.699
but I'm glad
we got it fixed up super-fast
so we can get back on our way.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.468
<i>  The season</i>
<i>  has been a nightmare,</i>

<i>  yeah, I'm doing real good.</i>

Get yourself
mentally prepared.

25:21.888 --> 25:23.621
Three more hours
and you're done.

Do you know what they say?
You get a good horse,
ride it, baby, ride it.

25:55.821 --> 25:59.757
Gary's down so long,
we're actually able to pan
a sample from the box,

25:59.759 --> 26:02.126
and see how good
this gold really is.

26:03.896 --> 26:06.797
And it's looking smokin' hot.

26:06.799 --> 26:08.966
[crew member]
yeah, that looks pretty good.

26:08.968 --> 26:12.970
That's sweet. There's tons
of gold down there, baby.

26:13.873 --> 26:18.409
You do the calculations.
A quick mental extrapolation.

26:18.411 --> 26:23.447
In that five hours' time,
we probably cleared about
500 square feet.

26:23.482 --> 26:25.916
Okay.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.985
<i>  I love running the numbers</i>
<i>  in my head when it comes</i>
<i>  to gold.</i>

26:27.987 --> 26:33.023
But if you're not careful,
it can get a little confusing
at times.

26:33.025 --> 26:34.658
How many square feet
are in an acre?

26:34.660 --> 26:37.795
Like 43,500-and-somethin',
I think.

26:37.797 --> 26:40.598
Ok, well, let's see.
How many acres are in a yard?

26:40.600 --> 26:47.638
I mean, you divide...
You multiply that by 375,
then divide it by 50.

26:47.640 --> 26:49.607
-How many hours
we got on that?
-Okay.

26:49.609 --> 26:54.011
-About...

27:09.829 --> 27:11.695
It's a matter
of public record.

27:11.697 --> 27:15.132

<i> [vernon] this winter</i>

<i> [vernon] I can't wait</i>

-Those are flakeys, dude.

Whoa!

29:27.666 --> 29:28.832
-Cool, dude.
-Yeah.

29:28.834 --> 29:31.535
-Nice nugget.
-Yeah, right in the top.

29:31.537 --> 29:34.037
First place I looked.
A big old chunk of gold.

29:36.342 --> 29:38.675
[zeke] we're like
the little engine that could.

29:38.677 --> 29:41.845
Mother nature has been
fighting us really hard
the whole way.

We've had bad ground,
we've had equipment
shorting out,

29:44.216 --> 29:46.416
but we just keep goin'.

29:46.418 --> 29:48.852
<i>  I know we've got</i>
<i>  some gold here, but I'm not</i>
<i>  gonna clean up yet.</i>

29:48.854 --> 29:53.190
I'm just gonna go rest up
so I'm ready for one more
strong dive tomorrow.

29:55.060 --> 29:57.528
Now we've seen gold.
This is silly,
my whole dive.

29:57.530 --> 30:01.098
So, after, like, weeks
of flailing about
in the blizzards,

30:01.100 --> 30:04.067
and not getting any gold
at all,
that's a pretty good feeling.

30:04.537 --> 30:06.336
Here we go.

in this jackpot.

But we're on
some killer stuff.

31:12.872 --> 31:16.340
<i>  That's the longest I've gone</i>
<i>  this season, and it was</i>
<i>  the best gold I've seen.</i>

<i>  It's looking good.</i>

<i>  Gonna get joe in the water</i>

31:33.626 --> 31:37.527
we're not giving up.
We're gonna keep on
fighting for it.

31:37.529 --> 31:41.064
Now we gotta get joe
down there, and just keep
grinding away at it.

31:41.066 --> 31:43.800
<i>  The sun's going down,</i>
<i>  but it doesn't matter to us.</i>

31:43.802 --> 31:45.202

<i>  And then we'll head back</i>
<i>  to town. Put it on the scale.</i>

32:50.736 --> 32:52.302
I'll be like a kid

32:53.772 --> 32:55.906

Your arm's broken.
Today's andy's birthday.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.593
Brand new baby,
and my girlfriend tells me,

33:16.595 --> 33:20.697
"I really need you
to start helping me out."

33:20.699 --> 33:24.167
the only thing I'm not doing
is the baby's not sucking
off my nipple.

33:24.903 --> 33:26.636
-Hi, mom.
-[mom] hi, babe.

33:26.638 --> 33:28.538
Here, let me get your bag.

33:28.540 --> 33:31.241
-Holy [bleep].
-No [bleep], it's heavy.

33:34.513 --> 33:37.848
[kris] oh, mom, I'm so glad
you're here.
I'm not sleeping at all.

33:37.850 --> 33:40.517
Bree has to feed the baby
five times a night.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.586
No, she doesn't.
She's gotta get her
on a schedule.

33:42.588 --> 33:44.788
[kris]
what the hell? That's not
what the doctor said.

33:44.790 --> 33:47.157
[mom] a lot of the time,
they don't even take
a lot of milk.

33:47.159 --> 33:49.059
That's why you put 'em
on a schedule.

33:54.266 --> 33:56.099
Andy. It's me.

33:56.101 --> 33:58.368

anything for my birthday.

-So you've got a minute.
-Andy, grow up.

34:07.646 --> 34:10.414

34:18.690 --> 34:21.158
Do you wanna know why
we don't celebrate
our birthdays?

34:21.160 --> 34:24.828
Because we were always so poor
that it's a bad reminder

work hard in their lives.

38:04.816 --> 38:07.350
-Yeah.
-We do the smart thing.

38:07.352 --> 38:09.519
If you guys would make
another 20 grand...

38:09.521 --> 38:12.088
Oh, we will.
We'll just like...
Dude, we're killing it.

38:12.858 --> 38:16.026
As long as the ice holds,
we'll be okay.

38:16.728 --> 38:19.095
<i> [narrator] across town...</i>

38:21.400 --> 38:24.768
<i> [man] hey, we were down</i>
<i>  for eight hours</i>
<i>  hammering it,</i>

38:24.770 --> 38:26.803
it's gonna be juicy.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.238
Yeah, I think we knocked it
out of the park.

38:28.373 --> 38:29.906
Joe, I'm sure
it looks like it.

38:30.409 --> 38:34.411
<i> [narrator] the longest dive</i>
<i>  in wild ranger history,</i>
<i>  is in the books.</i>

38:34.413 --> 38:36.146
Oh, [bleep].

38:36.715 --> 38:37.914
[groans]

38:37.916 --> 38:39.282
mind if I do a few curls?
[groans]

38:39.618 --> 38:40.650
[laughs]

38:40.652 --> 38:43.186
[narrator]
<i>  and vernon's ripped and ready</i>

38:43.188 --> 38:47.157
<i> to see how much gold his diver</i>
<i>  lifted over eight hours.</i>

38:47.159 --> 38:48.792
That's quite a different pot
of gold there.

38:48.794 --> 38:52.429
-This is a heavy one here.
-Oh, yeah.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.867
There's not much time left
this season.
That's just a fact.

38:57.869 --> 39:00.603
<i>  We might not get</i>
<i>  another dive in.</i>

39:00.605 --> 39:02.972
<i>  That's why this dive</i>
<i>  was so important.</i>

39:02.974 --> 39:07.010
We needed to crush it today,
and I believe we did.

39:07.879 --> 39:09.245
Let's weigh this up.

39:10.415 --> 39:12.115
[gary]
let's see what we got.

39:12.984 --> 39:15.318
Two... Three...

39:15.954 --> 39:19.989
Four, five, six, seven, eight.

39:20.125 --> 39:24.127
I like the way you pour.
13, 14...

39:24.129 --> 39:29.065
15, 16, 17, 18, 20...

39:29.201 --> 39:30.233
[gary]
there we go.

39:31.002 --> 39:32.869
Twenty-three...

39:32.871 --> 39:34.404
Twenty-seven...

39:35.774 --> 39:37.073
Thirty.

39:37.476 --> 39:40.810
30.2. Holy moly.

39:40.812 --> 39:45.615
<i> [narrator] 30.2 ounces</i>
<i>  is worth north of $57,000.</i>

39:45.617 --> 39:48.752
<i>  And while he may be short</i>
<i>  of his 200-ounce goal,</i>

39:48.754 --> 39:52.856
<i>  there is no question,</i>
<i>  the salty veteran</i>
<i>  has the hottest hand in nome.</i>

39:52.858 --> 39:55.992
That's the best count
I've seen in a long time.

39:56.395 --> 39:57.894
-I needed that.
-Yeah.

39:57.896 --> 40:00.397
This winter
has been incredible.

40:00.399 --> 40:01.765
<i>  I've been doing this</i>
<i>  for a lot of years,</i>

40:01.767 --> 40:04.834
<i>  and I have never</i>
<i>  had one like this.</i>

40:04.836 --> 40:07.737
My one wish
is we could keep mining
long enough

40:07.739 --> 40:09.606
to crush 200 ounces.

40:09.608 --> 40:11.274
How amazing would that be?

40:11.276 --> 40:14.611
Shawn, you better be looking
over your shoulder.

40:14.613 --> 40:18.281
Let's get this tucked away,
and get the hell on back
out there.

40:18.583 --> 40:22.185
<i>  We're on it.</i>
<i>  We're finally, finally on it.</i>

40:23.822 --> 40:27.257
<i> [narrator] vernon continues</i>
<i>  his reign on top</i>
<i>  of the leaderboard.</i>

40:28.393 --> 40:31.361
<i>  But shawn remains</i>
<i>  within striking distance.</i>

40:32.931 --> 40:37.400
<i>  Next time,</i>
<i>  on the season finale</i>
<i>  of bering sea gold ...</i>

40:37.402 --> 40:41.137
Ice is starting to go [bleep].
But we still
wanna keep goin'.

40:44.409 --> 40:47.911
-Yes, you and I are now
finishing it strong.
<i>  - [crew member] all right.</i>

40:47.913 --> 40:50.146
One more dive and we're done.

40:50.148 --> 40:51.414
[diver speaking]

40:52.951 --> 40:54.751
well, get as much as you can.

40:54.753 --> 40:56.085
Kinda like
the last man out here.

40:56.488 --> 40:58.288
[diver speaking]

40:58.290 --> 41:00.824
or it means we're making
the wrong decision.

41:00.826 --> 41:03.693
<i> [vernon] we got an</i>
<i>  open-water lead out there</i>
<i>  that's been closing on us.</i>

41:03.695 --> 41:04.761
<i>  It's over.</i>

41:04.763 --> 41:05.962
We've gotta move,
like, right now.

41:05.964 --> 41:07.964
[diver 2 speaking]

41:09.000 --> 41:10.166
oh, [beep] come on.

41:14.005 --> 41:15.371
Whoo-hoo!

41:15.373 --> 41:17.907
Gotta good end
to a for a long winter.
