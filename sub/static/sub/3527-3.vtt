01:37.862 --> 01:41.991
You think you know a story,
but you only know how it ends.

01:42.200 --> 01:46.830
To get to the heart of the story,
you have to go back to the beginning.

03:04.365 --> 03:06.534
Let's rehearse again, everybody.

03:06.784 --> 03:11.080
Shut the gate. Concentrate please.

03:13.124 --> 03:15.168
Ready, everybody?

03:16.169 --> 03:18.421
Attack!

03:19.756 --> 03:21.090
Well, go on! Attack!

03:35.730 --> 03:38.816
That's enough, everybody.
Stop, you idiots.

03:39.901 --> 03:41.903
Stop!

03:45.490 --> 03:49.118
Have you any idea
of the cost of this production?

03:50.995 --> 03:53.539
Do you truly imagine
His Majesty will be happy...

03:53.748 --> 03:57.752
...to spend a small fortune
on such a large shambles?

04:00.380 --> 04:02.131
Who fired that musket ball?

04:04.175 --> 04:06.761
I think I did, Mr. Cornish, sir.

04:13.434 --> 04:14.936
What are you trying to do?

04:15.144 --> 04:19.565
If you can't entertain the envoys, then
you're going to shoot them instead?

04:19.774 --> 04:21.442
Is that it?

04:23.945 --> 04:25.238
Again.

04:29.283 --> 04:31.035
I have some business
for you, Charles.

04:31.244 --> 04:32.995
As you desire.

04:33.204 --> 04:36.124
My sister Margaret is to marry
the king of Portugal.

04:36.332 --> 04:39.252
I want you to escort her
and her dowry to Lisbon...

04:39.460 --> 04:40.962
...and give her away in my name.

04:41.212 --> 04:43.005
Why me?

04:43.214 --> 04:45.383
I need someone I can trust.

04:45.591 --> 04:47.343
You trust me with a beautiful woman?

04:48.177 --> 04:52.181
With my sister, of course I trust you.

04:52.432 --> 04:54.517
Why shouldn't I?

04:55.643 --> 04:59.313
In any case,
you're already betrothed to?

04:59.522 --> 05:02.567
What's her name? I can't keep up.

05:02.775 --> 05:04.277
Elizabeth Grey.

05:04.485 --> 05:06.404
She's a cousin
of the marquess of Dorset.

05:06.612 --> 05:08.447
Exactly.

05:09.949 --> 05:13.703
I'm honoured by Your Majesty's trust,
but there's still a difficulty.

05:13.911 --> 05:16.789
I'm not important enough
to give away the sister of a king...

05:16.998 --> 05:18.958
...let alone the king of England.

05:19.167 --> 05:21.627
That's why I'm making you a duke.

05:23.212 --> 05:26.716
Duke of Suffolk.
How does that please your grace?

05:30.636 --> 05:32.847
Come on!

05:34.724 --> 05:37.476
The emperor
sends his best wishes to the king.

05:37.685 --> 05:41.772
We are most grateful to you, Mr. More,
for coming to welcome us in person.

05:42.023 --> 05:43.608
No, it's my honour.

05:43.816 --> 05:47.486
His Majesty regards your visit
as a thing of great moment.

05:47.737 --> 05:50.448
When shall we have
an audience with His Majesty?

05:50.656 --> 05:52.658
Let me advise
Your Excellencies on this...

05:52.867 --> 05:55.620
...there's only one way
to reach the king's ear...

05:55.828 --> 05:58.748
...and that is through the good offices
of Cardinal Wolsey.

05:58.998 --> 06:00.708
We heard some rumours, Mr. More...

06:00.917 --> 06:03.586
...that the cardinal
advocates French interests.

06:03.836 --> 06:05.963
Only when he considers them
to be in ours.

06:07.465 --> 06:09.717
Tell me,
what is the emperor's attitude...

06:09.926 --> 06:13.012
...to the rise of the Lutheran heresy
in some of his territories?

06:13.262 --> 06:15.431
My friend Erasmus tells me
that in Germany...

06:15.681 --> 06:17.516
...it's spreading like a forest fire.

06:17.767 --> 06:20.853
His Highness does everything
in his power to suppress it.

06:21.062 --> 06:23.439
But, as you know,
Luther himself is the guest...

06:23.689 --> 06:26.776
...of one of the German princes
unfortunately beyond his control.

06:26.984 --> 06:31.197
My king is writing a pamphlet
demolishing Luther's arguments...

06:31.405 --> 06:34.367
...defending the papacy and our faith.

06:34.617 --> 06:39.163
You mean, he is writing it himself,
with his own hand?

06:39.413 --> 06:41.582
No.

06:41.791 --> 06:46.128
There are a great many things
that my king can do.

06:51.926 --> 06:55.262
The envoys from the emperor,
Your Eminence.

06:57.056 --> 06:58.891
Your Excellencies.

06:59.141 --> 07:01.268
This is indeed a happy day.

07:01.519 --> 07:06.315
We have planned many festivities
in honour of this most welcome visit.

07:06.565 --> 07:08.943
And it is my devout hope and wish...

07:09.151 --> 07:12.029
...that together we can finalize
the details of a treaty...

07:12.238 --> 07:16.033
...which will bind your master
and mine in perpetual friendship.

07:16.283 --> 07:19.203
That is very much our hope too,
Your Eminence.

07:19.453 --> 07:21.831
Good, please.

07:23.833 --> 07:25.918
Not you, Thomas.

07:30.256 --> 07:33.008
I don't want to waste
your time or mine.

07:33.217 --> 07:35.761
So before we drink, tell me...

07:35.970 --> 07:41.392
...is the emperor
in fact sincere about this treaty?

07:41.600 --> 07:44.645
- Of course he is.
- Good.

07:44.854 --> 07:46.355
Then I propose to cement it...

07:46.564 --> 07:49.233
...we also announce
the betrothal of the emperor...

07:49.442 --> 07:52.194
...to the daughter of the king,
Princess Mary.

07:52.403 --> 07:55.906
It is our understanding that she
is already betrothed to the dauphin.

07:56.115 --> 07:59.952
But now,
she will be betrothed to Charles.

08:00.161 --> 08:02.746
Unless you have
some other objection?

08:02.955 --> 08:04.748
On the contrary.

08:04.957 --> 08:08.377
Good. Then we are agreed.

08:16.051 --> 08:21.473
The Emperor told us
to inform Your Eminence personally...

08:21.682 --> 08:27.229
...that he wishes to bestow upon you
a very generous pension.

08:30.316 --> 08:35.404
He will also throw his weight
behind your ambitions to be Pope.

08:39.241 --> 08:42.870
Let us drink to the success
of Your Excellencies' visit.

08:43.078 --> 08:45.331
By all means.

08:49.126 --> 08:51.587
You have found means
to put my niece before the king?

08:51.795 --> 08:53.881
Yes, Your Grace. It's already arranged.

08:54.423 --> 08:58.802
Anne is to appear in the pageant
for the Spanish envoys. As is the king.

08:59.011 --> 09:01.388
She will find a way
to draw his attention.

09:01.597 --> 09:02.973
Good.

09:03.182 --> 09:04.808
Once she opens her legs for him...

09:05.017 --> 09:07.937
...she can open her mouth
and denounce Wolsey.

09:10.064 --> 09:14.109
They do say that the sharpest blades
are sheathed in the softest pouches.

09:22.326 --> 09:23.869
His Eminence, Cardinal Wolsey...

09:24.119 --> 09:28.457
...and the Spanish ambassadors,
Mendoza and Chapuys.

10:09.707 --> 10:10.999
Who are those ladies?

10:11.250 --> 10:13.919
They are the graces, Excellence.

10:14.169 --> 10:19.299
They have names like Kindness,
Honour, Constancy, Mercy and Pity.

10:20.050 --> 10:21.927
They are prisoners in the castle.

10:22.136 --> 10:25.305
The figure to the left
under the broken hearts...

10:25.514 --> 10:29.393
...is His Majesty's sister,
Princess Margaret.

10:30.978 --> 10:33.105
Who is keeping them prisoner?

10:33.355 --> 10:38.777
Danger, Jealousy, Unkindness, Scorn,
Disdain, Strangeness, et cetera.

10:49.037 --> 10:51.582
Is the king there?
Which one is the king?

10:51.790 --> 10:57.379
The men represent Youth, Devotion,
Loyalty, Pleasure, Gentleness, Liberty.

10:57.588 --> 11:00.340
And, yes,
His Majesty is hid amongst them.

11:06.763 --> 11:10.434
As Ardent Desire,
I demand you release your prisoners.

11:10.684 --> 11:14.897
As Lady Scorn,
I laugh at your desires.

11:15.147 --> 11:18.358
These men are noble lords.

11:18.609 --> 11:21.320
No, they're just men dressed up.

11:22.863 --> 11:27.367
I say it again, release these fair
damsels that you keep so cruelly.

11:27.576 --> 11:28.869
Never.

11:30.954 --> 11:36.126
Then you give us no choice but
to attack and breach your defences.

11:37.211 --> 11:39.922
No knight shall ever breach mine.

11:43.175 --> 11:48.138
Lady, Desire overcomes all.

11:49.514 --> 11:52.309
Attack!

12:06.448 --> 12:08.283
Perseverance,
you are my prisoner now.

12:18.919 --> 12:22.214
- Sister.
- Brother.

13:00.419 --> 13:04.840
And now all shall be unmasked.

13:48.133 --> 13:49.885
I must speak to you.

13:50.093 --> 13:52.763
I trust you have settled
all your affairs here, Margaret?

13:52.971 --> 13:54.264
Yes, but...

13:54.473 --> 13:56.433
The king has written
of his love for you...

13:56.641 --> 13:59.978
...and his eagerness to set eyes
on you, having seen your portrait.

14:04.149 --> 14:08.153
I plead with you, as your sister,
don't make me marry him.

14:08.361 --> 14:10.071
He's an old man.

14:22.584 --> 14:24.669
And who are you?

14:24.878 --> 14:28.590
I'm Anne Boleyn.

15:00.497 --> 15:03.792
Thank you, Master Cornish.
I'm very grateful to you.

15:05.168 --> 15:07.295
Sir Thomas.

15:21.977 --> 15:24.271
May I see your mistress?

15:29.985 --> 15:32.654
A gentleman, my lady.

15:36.074 --> 15:38.326
Mr. Brandon.

15:39.077 --> 15:41.871
You are not yet invested
a duke, I think.

15:42.122 --> 15:44.874
Aye, madam.

15:46.835 --> 15:49.921
I shall be taking with me to Portugal,
a company of 200 persons.

15:50.130 --> 15:53.258
They shall include my chamberlain,
my chaplain, my laundress...

15:53.466 --> 15:55.302
...all of my ladies.

15:55.510 --> 15:57.012
Yes, madam.

15:57.262 --> 16:00.682
Should you have anything to discuss,
you may do so with my chamberlain.

16:00.890 --> 16:02.183
Yes, madam.

16:02.434 --> 16:07.647
I'm surprised my brother chose a man
without noble blood to represent him.

16:07.897 --> 16:11.192
Even Norfolk would have been better.

16:24.998 --> 16:27.792
The queen is ready.

16:28.626 --> 16:31.212
I will announce you to the queen.

16:32.005 --> 16:36.551
Her Majesty, Catherine of Aragon,
Queen of England.

16:39.554 --> 16:42.891
Your Majesty,
the envoys from Spain.

16:47.979 --> 16:50.774
I know you have an audience
with the king.

16:50.982 --> 16:53.693
I just couldn't let you pass
without seeing you.

16:53.985 --> 16:54.986
Majesty...

16:55.195 --> 16:58.865
...your nephew the emperor
sends you his love and filial regards.

16:59.073 --> 17:00.158
Always.

17:00.408 --> 17:02.952
Tell him, if he loves me...

17:03.161 --> 17:04.496
...he should write to me more often.

17:05.497 --> 17:08.708
But I am happy from the bottom
of my heart...

17:08.916 --> 17:10.794
...that you are here...

17:11.002 --> 17:14.255
...and that there is going to be a treaty.

17:18.009 --> 17:21.095
Just beware the cardinal.

17:26.768 --> 17:29.938
His Majesty will receive you now.

17:35.276 --> 17:39.364
Gentlemen, welcome to my kingdom.

17:39.614 --> 17:43.993
I know you will succeed in your efforts
to negotiate a successful treaty.

17:44.202 --> 17:47.914
You may trust everything
Cardinal Wolsey says.

17:48.122 --> 17:52.669
He speaks for me directly
in all matters.

17:52.877 --> 17:56.130
As for my part, I should like to invite
the emperor to visit here...

17:56.339 --> 17:58.383
...as soon as can be arranged.

17:58.591 --> 18:03.513
The visit would give pleasure
both to me and to my queen.

18:04.305 --> 18:05.723
Your Majesty.

18:20.947 --> 18:23.658
- When's he coming?
- At the end of this month.

18:23.866 --> 18:25.577
So soon?

18:25.827 --> 18:29.497
If he needs allies for his attack on
the French, he intends to do so shortly.

18:29.706 --> 18:33.001
Indeed. The envoys told me
in confidence...

18:33.209 --> 18:36.879
...that the emperor will strike first
against the French occupation in Italy.

18:37.088 --> 18:38.840
He has a claim to the duchy of Milan.

18:39.716 --> 18:41.342
And then?

18:41.592 --> 18:44.846
Then having driven them out of Italy
with your help...

18:45.054 --> 18:47.640
...he will invade France itself.

18:51.477 --> 18:54.355
I want you to prepare
all our forces for a joint invasion.

18:54.605 --> 18:57.567
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- And I want another warship.

18:58.860 --> 19:01.988
Your Majesty, we have
only just launched the Victory.

19:02.238 --> 19:05.158
Then order another one.
A greater one.

19:06.117 --> 19:10.371
What we lack in men,
we can more than make up for in ships.

19:10.580 --> 19:12.665
We're an island race, cardinal.

19:12.874 --> 19:15.335
We have the best
and bravest sailors in the world.

19:15.543 --> 19:19.088
- I will have the greatest navy.
- Ships are expensive.

19:19.338 --> 19:21.966
My father was a careful man.

19:22.175 --> 19:26.846
A shrewd man. A business man.

19:27.055 --> 19:30.224
He left me a great deal
of money, Your Eminence.

19:30.433 --> 19:32.268
I intend to spend it.

19:45.907 --> 19:47.617
Good.

19:47.825 --> 19:50.161
Sir Thomas Boleyn.

19:53.998 --> 19:55.500
Sir Thomas.

19:55.750 --> 19:57.710
Majesty.

19:57.919 --> 20:02.715
Come. I feel I've been a little remiss.

20:02.924 --> 20:06.511
I never showed my gratitude to you
for the diplomatic efforts you made.

20:06.719 --> 20:08.513
Your Majesty had no need.

20:08.763 --> 20:12.517
I'm simply content to serve you
in whatever capacity I can be of use.

20:12.725 --> 20:15.853
Nevertheless,
I wish to show my gratitude.

20:16.729 --> 20:19.816
It pleases me to make you
a knight of the Garter.

20:20.024 --> 20:23.110
I'm also appointing you
comptroller of my household.

20:26.030 --> 20:27.323
I believe Your Majesty...

20:27.532 --> 20:30.618
...has a greater opinion
of my talents than I have.

20:30.868 --> 20:33.162
I shall be the judge of that.

20:35.373 --> 20:36.666
We shall talk more later.

20:40.127 --> 20:42.004
Oh, I almost forgot.

20:43.798 --> 20:45.424
Your daughter.

20:45.675 --> 20:47.677
The one who performed
in our masquerade.

20:47.885 --> 20:49.720
- Anne.
- Yes.

20:54.058 --> 20:56.769
As a matter of fact,
she's soon to come to court...

20:56.978 --> 20:59.355
...as a lady in waiting to Her Majesty.

21:24.505 --> 21:26.424
And will you leave me thus?

21:26.632 --> 21:29.719
Say nay, say nay, for shame

21:29.927 --> 21:34.682
To save you from the blame
Of all my grief and grame

21:34.890 --> 21:36.767
And will you leave me so?

21:36.976 --> 21:40.438
Say no, say no

21:41.439 --> 21:43.399
And will you leave me thus?

21:43.608 --> 21:46.652
And have no more pity
Of he that loves thee?

21:48.446 --> 21:51.532
Alas, your cruelty!

21:52.199 --> 21:54.327
And will you leave me thus?

21:54.535 --> 21:57.997
Say no, say no

22:02.752 --> 22:05.921
Well, do you like it?

22:06.130 --> 22:09.050
Should I like something
that accuses me of being cruel?

22:19.935 --> 22:23.481
- You are cruel, Mistress Anne.
- Am I?

22:25.733 --> 22:28.069
You have no claim on me,
Master Wyatt.

22:29.779 --> 22:32.281
I have the same claim
as every other lover...

22:32.490 --> 22:34.909
...to whom a woman's heart
has been freely given.

22:35.159 --> 22:37.995
You are a poet, as I am a woman.

22:38.204 --> 22:41.624
Poets and women are always free
with their hearts, are they not?

22:42.541 --> 22:43.834
Anne...

22:46.670 --> 22:49.590
Stop it, Tom. You mustn't.

22:54.345 --> 22:56.263
Then I was right.

23:03.312 --> 23:05.564
You are leaving me.

23:11.445 --> 23:14.824
- Why don't you answer me?
- You're married.

23:16.659 --> 23:20.371
Yes. But I'm separated.

23:20.579 --> 23:23.040
I'm going to divorce.

23:23.791 --> 23:25.251
I mean, who isn't married?

23:31.966 --> 23:34.718
You must never ask to see me again.
Do you promise?

23:36.470 --> 23:38.472
Why should I?

23:38.681 --> 23:40.975
When I have just learned
what promises are worth.

23:43.143 --> 23:45.938
Is it another? Is that it?

23:46.188 --> 23:48.524
Do you love another?

23:53.195 --> 23:54.488
Never ask of me...

23:55.406 --> 23:58.284
...and never, if you value your life,
speak of me to others.

23:58.492 --> 24:00.244
Do you understand?

24:06.000 --> 24:08.294
Have you no pity?

24:13.424 --> 24:18.053
Can you imagine? Lmagine
what he's gonna be like now.

24:18.262 --> 24:21.682
I'll wager he's already ordered
a bigger codpiece.

24:21.932 --> 24:25.019
Yes, Your Grace. No, Your Grace.

24:25.227 --> 24:29.189
Let me bottle up your farts
and sell them for nectar, Your Grace.

24:29.481 --> 24:32.109
I don't wanna think about it any more.

24:32.318 --> 24:34.278
It makes me ill.

24:37.114 --> 24:38.616
So, what shall we do?

24:40.159 --> 24:41.660
Find women.

24:44.288 --> 24:47.374
Even if she was a complete Venus...

24:47.583 --> 24:50.628
...I couldn't satisfy her
in my dejected state.

24:53.964 --> 24:57.051
- Let's just drink more, then.
- All right.

24:58.552 --> 25:01.597
Here. To His Grace.

25:01.847 --> 25:06.101
- Here's to Charles.
- His Grace.

25:09.730 --> 25:12.274
Did the envoys leave in good cheer?

25:12.524 --> 25:15.194
They were in excellent spirits.

25:15.778 --> 25:17.654
The treaty is agreed.

25:19.239 --> 25:21.241
And my nephew will come?

25:21.492 --> 25:26.622
We wait for news.
Wolsey will find out.

25:34.463 --> 25:35.756
I had a dream.

25:37.841 --> 25:42.888
In my dream, you came to me again
and held me in your arms...

25:43.097 --> 25:46.266
...and you whispered
that all would be well.

25:46.475 --> 25:49.645
And all manner of things
would be well.

25:53.982 --> 25:55.818
Henry.

25:56.819 --> 26:00.030
Sweetheart. Husband.

26:02.533 --> 26:08.288
You must believe me.
I never knew your brother in that way.

26:10.457 --> 26:12.459
He was so young. And he was ill.

26:18.006 --> 26:23.971
I have never known another man,
nor ever want to.

26:28.058 --> 26:29.518
I love you.

27:15.022 --> 27:16.356
The king.

27:30.704 --> 27:33.916
The king would like you
to come to his chambers.

27:52.643 --> 27:54.436
Mary.

27:55.687 --> 27:58.440
My darling daughter.

28:05.822 --> 28:09.326
- Have you said your prayers?
- Yes.

28:30.806 --> 28:32.641
My Lord...

28:37.229 --> 28:39.606
...how like you this?

28:58.041 --> 29:04.256
Has the king sent any message
or sign that he might visit me tonight?

29:04.464 --> 29:09.302
- No, my lady.
- No.

29:29.114 --> 29:32.033
I'm worried about you, my love.

29:35.245 --> 29:37.998
You work too hard.

29:38.248 --> 29:40.625
I know that.

29:43.879 --> 29:46.131
It will kill you.

29:48.508 --> 29:53.889
I know that too.
What am I supposed to do?

29:55.640 --> 29:58.185
Stay alive.

30:12.032 --> 30:14.367
- Aren't you coming?
- What's happening?

30:14.576 --> 30:18.413
The queen's new ladies have arrived.
Come on.

30:25.921 --> 30:30.884
- Beautiful hair, mistress.
- Things are looking up.

30:32.344 --> 30:34.554
Mistress. Mistress.

30:34.763 --> 30:37.390
The way she carries herself.

30:38.808 --> 30:40.602
"What serpent was ever so venomous...

30:40.810 --> 30:43.146
...as to call the holy city of Rome
'Babylon'...

30:43.355 --> 30:46.358
...and the Pope's authority 'Tyranny'...

30:46.566 --> 30:50.028
...and turn the name
of our Holy Father into 'Anti-Christ'?"

30:51.655 --> 30:53.740
It's very good.

30:54.741 --> 30:58.078
- Strongly worded, but it's very good.
- You're sure?

30:58.328 --> 31:01.414
Well, you might think of toning down
the polemic, just a little.

31:02.832 --> 31:05.418
For example, where
you describe Luther as this weed.

31:05.627 --> 31:07.337
Where is it?

31:07.545 --> 31:12.425
Here, "This dilapidated,
sick and evil-minded sheep."

31:13.301 --> 31:14.594
Tone it down?

31:14.844 --> 31:19.224
Well, yes, for diplomatic purposes.

31:19.432 --> 31:21.476
No, never.

31:21.726 --> 31:24.187
No language can be strong enough
to condemn Luther...

31:24.396 --> 31:27.607
...nor gracious enough
to praise His Holiness.

31:29.234 --> 31:34.906
I will dedicate a copy to him
and you will take it to him in Rome.

31:35.156 --> 31:36.449
Why me?

31:36.658 --> 31:40.412
If there is anything true and good in it,
it is due to you.

31:42.080 --> 31:45.959
I could never have written it,
or anything else, Sir Thomas More...

31:46.167 --> 31:49.212
...without your guidance
and unfailing honesty.

31:50.130 --> 31:51.798
Why did you call me Sir Thomas?

31:52.966 --> 31:54.801
A knighthood is the least I could do.

31:55.051 --> 31:57.137
It's a great deal more than I deserve.

31:57.387 --> 31:59.472
Now, don't be too modest, Thomas.

32:00.265 --> 32:02.976
You're not a saint.

32:05.061 --> 32:07.313
There is something else
I want you to do for me.

32:08.690 --> 32:12.402
Seize all the copies
of Luther's works you can find...

32:13.903 --> 32:15.196
...and burn them.

32:17.073 --> 32:18.616
Burn them all.

32:31.546 --> 32:33.590
From France.

32:59.199 --> 33:03.494
Well, King Francis
has already discovered...

33:03.703 --> 33:06.581
...our rapprochement
with the emperor.

33:06.789 --> 33:08.208
He feels betrayed and angry...

33:08.416 --> 33:11.961
...and is making threats
against our interests.

33:13.004 --> 33:15.089
Who told him?

34:11.062 --> 34:14.148
My lords and ladies,
His lmperial Highness...

34:14.357 --> 34:18.695
...Charles, Holy Roman Emperor,
King of Aragon, Valencia, Naples...

34:18.902 --> 34:22.031
...and Sicily,
Duke of the Burgundian Territories...

34:22.239 --> 34:25.243
...Archduke of Austria.

34:35.920 --> 34:37.505
Your Eminence, a moment.

34:38.422 --> 34:42.385
Move away, Mr. Pace. Move away.

34:42.592 --> 34:44.762
Yes, Eminence.

34:44.971 --> 34:47.724
Your Highness.

34:48.891 --> 34:51.060
Your Majesty.

34:53.020 --> 34:56.274
I did not expect...

34:56.524 --> 34:58.609
I could not sustain the anticipation.

34:58.818 --> 35:02.155
I had to come straight down
and welcome you myself.

35:02.405 --> 35:04.157
Then I am truly honoured.

35:06.492 --> 35:08.161
Tonight, we shall dance and feast.

35:08.411 --> 35:11.748
And tomorrow,
you shall come see my ships.

35:11.956 --> 35:15.585
Gentlemen. Music. Let's celebrate.

35:15.793 --> 35:17.503
Come.

35:21.757 --> 35:24.385
Remove that man.

35:31.476 --> 35:35.480
Wait. No, wait. Wait.

35:39.275 --> 35:40.568
Mr. Pace.

35:43.988 --> 35:45.281
You knew, of course...

35:45.490 --> 35:49.202
...that His Majesty was going to make
this surprise visit, did you not?

35:49.452 --> 35:52.497
Well, yes. As his secretary,
I would obviously know.

35:52.705 --> 35:54.207
Yes, of course, you did.

35:54.457 --> 35:56.584
And you also knew, of course...

35:56.792 --> 35:59.086
...that the imperial envoys
had come privately...

35:59.295 --> 36:01.714
...to make a treaty with His Majesty.

36:01.923 --> 36:05.051
But then, of course,
you speak Spanish, don't you?

36:05.259 --> 36:07.178
Almost as well as you speak French.

36:08.721 --> 36:12.725
L... I don't understand, Your Eminence.

36:12.975 --> 36:15.228
I think you do, Mr. Pace.
I really think you do.

36:15.436 --> 36:19.106
Because you see,
I think you not only spy for me...

36:20.816 --> 36:22.860
...you also spy for the French.

36:23.986 --> 36:25.529
No. It's not true.

36:26.489 --> 36:28.908
You are removed
from all your positions.

36:30.076 --> 36:31.786
No, wait, wait, wait.
I swear to you.

36:31.994 --> 36:35.039
I swear by everything
that's holy, it's not true.

36:35.248 --> 36:37.541
His Majesty is held dear in my heart.

36:37.792 --> 36:41.212
It is treason
to plot against His Majesty.

36:41.963 --> 36:44.799
Wait. What are you saying?

36:45.049 --> 36:47.051
Wait, Your Eminence, please.
Don't do this.

36:47.260 --> 36:49.470
You know it's not true,
Your Eminence, please.

36:49.679 --> 36:52.265
I beg you.
You know it's not true, Your Eminence.

36:52.473 --> 36:53.766
Please! Please!

36:54.016 --> 36:57.895
This is my flagship, The Mary Rose.

36:58.104 --> 37:00.940
She's the largest warship afloat.

37:01.148 --> 37:05.361
She displaces 700 tons,
fires 91 guns...

37:06.362 --> 37:08.155
...and has a company of 400 men.

37:12.868 --> 37:14.704
I have nothing like this.

37:15.371 --> 37:17.540
You have vast armies.

37:19.041 --> 37:23.087
Together, we shall be invincible.

37:23.796 --> 37:25.631
How could the French withstand us?

37:27.049 --> 37:31.053
With you beside me,
there is no boundary...

37:31.262 --> 37:37.226
...or frontier
or world we could not conquer.

37:39.103 --> 37:41.022
I like you already.

37:43.065 --> 37:47.403
Except for the chin,
what is there not to like?

38:00.833 --> 38:03.169
Prisoner to the steps.

38:11.010 --> 38:13.137
You must believe me,
I'm an innocent man.

38:13.345 --> 38:16.265
I don't know why
I have been brought here.

38:17.475 --> 38:20.060
I'm innocent!

38:22.021 --> 38:23.647
No, no, no.
I've done nothing wrong.

38:23.856 --> 38:26.192
I've done nothing wrong!

38:26.442 --> 38:32.239
You know, you and I are united
by an indissoluble tie.

38:32.448 --> 38:36.911
Since you married my mother's sister,
you are really my uncle.

38:40.080 --> 38:46.045
It's an affinity which both delights
and pleases me, nephew.

38:47.004 --> 38:51.467
Your Highness, your aunt awaits.

38:54.136 --> 38:58.557
Your Majesty, His lmperial Highness,
Charles, Holy Roman Emperor.

39:18.160 --> 39:24.416
Majesty, I ask for your blessing,
as a nephew to an aunt.

39:24.625 --> 39:28.712
I give you my blessing freely,
my dear Charles...

39:30.005 --> 39:32.383
...as I give you my love.

39:35.719 --> 39:37.763
Your Highness...

39:38.597 --> 39:43.060
...allow me to present
my daughter Mary, your future bride.

39:48.148 --> 39:51.443
Bravo! Come.

39:55.447 --> 39:58.534
Now, we must wait
to be married.

40:00.786 --> 40:03.372
Do you think you have the patience?

40:04.790 --> 40:08.168
I have a present for Your Highness.
Do you want to see it?

40:08.419 --> 40:12.214
I love presents. Show me.

40:15.676 --> 40:16.969
There. Look.

40:19.763 --> 40:22.349
- Are they for me?
- Do you like them?

40:22.558 --> 40:27.980
They're the best presents I've ever had.
Thank you, Your Highness.

40:52.254 --> 40:55.507
As soon as possible,
you must both come and visit me.

40:55.758 --> 40:59.136
I want to show you especially
the treasures of Montezuma...

40:59.344 --> 41:02.890
...the king of the Aztecs,
that General Cortes...

41:03.098 --> 41:05.684
...recently discovered in Mexico.

41:05.893 --> 41:07.770
- We should love that.
- Yes.

41:07.978 --> 41:10.522
We've heard a little
about the lands across the sea...

41:10.731 --> 41:12.357
...they call the Indies.

41:12.608 --> 41:16.862
I tell you, I swear to you,
that is where the future lies.

41:17.070 --> 41:20.282
So much undiscovered land.

41:20.491 --> 41:24.369
So much wealth of gold and silver...

41:24.620 --> 41:27.915
...of minerals and salts.

41:36.465 --> 41:38.175
Madam.

41:48.644 --> 41:50.479
Sweetheart.

41:52.231 --> 41:56.193
Put yourself in his way.

41:59.488 --> 42:01.240
How are your preparations going?

42:01.490 --> 42:03.951
We are recruiting
more German mercenaries.

42:04.159 --> 42:07.746
But everything is going well.

42:07.996 --> 42:12.751
- I shall take Milan by next spring.
- And then?

42:13.001 --> 42:18.215
And then, together,
we shall invade France...

42:18.465 --> 42:23.720
...and bring to an end the adventures
of that libertine monarch...

42:23.929 --> 42:25.430
...King Francis.

42:25.681 --> 42:27.558
That will make me very happy.

42:27.766 --> 42:29.977
It will also make you king of France.

42:33.021 --> 42:34.856
Yes.

42:47.786 --> 42:49.621
Will you dance, Your Highness?

42:49.830 --> 42:53.667
With Your Majesty's permission.

42:56.503 --> 42:58.463
Granted.

43:10.851 --> 43:12.686
Excuse me.

43:15.272 --> 43:19.985
The king of Portugal,
I've heard he also has gout.

43:21.320 --> 43:25.866
They say his spine is deformed.
He walks like a crab.

43:30.454 --> 43:31.872
Promise me something, brother.

43:32.122 --> 43:36.168
I'll agree to marry him
on one condition.

43:36.376 --> 43:42.049
When he's dead, which can't be long,
I can marry whom I choose.

43:45.260 --> 43:47.137
Agreed?

43:55.979 --> 43:58.774
Not drinking today, Charles,
or should I say, Your Grace?

44:00.525 --> 44:03.153
You should definitely call him
by his real name...

44:03.361 --> 44:05.238
...which is cunt or villain.

44:05.489 --> 44:08.867
- Why?
- We're supposed to be friends, Charles.

44:11.536 --> 44:14.456
- Aren't we still?
- Not if you don't show us favour.

44:14.664 --> 44:18.126
It's within your gift to ask His Majesty
to give us some titles...

44:18.335 --> 44:19.795
...or at least some land.

44:20.003 --> 44:23.173
It seems that everything the king has
to give, he's given to you.

44:26.384 --> 44:29.262
- Jealous?
- Naturally.

44:29.513 --> 44:32.099
As you rise, so too should we.

44:32.349 --> 44:35.602
So, what can we do for you,
Your Grace?

44:37.062 --> 44:38.688
Show me some respect.

44:54.496 --> 44:57.290
I am so glad to see you.

44:57.499 --> 44:59.960
It is often lonely here.

45:00.168 --> 45:01.837
Lonely?

45:02.045 --> 45:05.924
Things are not well between us,
His Majesty and I.

45:06.132 --> 45:12.556
But I saw with my own eyes
how attentive he is to you.

45:12.764 --> 45:16.351
He looks at you with such devotion...

45:16.560 --> 45:20.146
...it seems, with such love.

45:20.355 --> 45:25.610
I fear that is for your benefit.
Henry is a good masker.

45:25.819 --> 45:27.362
I don't wanna hear this again.

45:34.077 --> 45:36.246
Lady Anne.

45:36.496 --> 45:39.124
Yes, Your Majesty.

45:39.374 --> 45:44.379
I think sometimes
he will ask me for a divorce.

45:44.588 --> 45:46.881
A divorce?

45:47.090 --> 45:50.802
No. That's impossible.

45:51.011 --> 45:53.555
Is it?

45:54.180 --> 45:55.640
Forgive me.

47:14.928 --> 47:16.679
Anne.

47:19.182 --> 47:21.434
No. Not like this.

47:23.144 --> 47:25.772
- How?
- Seduce me.

47:25.980 --> 47:30.860
Write letters to me.
And poems. I love poems.

47:31.111 --> 47:35.240
Ravish me with your words.
Seduce me.

47:49.921 --> 47:52.340
Majesty?

47:52.549 --> 47:54.342
It's all right.

47:58.304 --> 48:00.140
She's gone.

48:06.479 --> 48:07.856
For Your Majesties to sign...

48:08.064 --> 48:12.527
...between you this treaty
of perpetual amity and concord...

48:13.611 --> 48:16.573
...and to confirm with your seals
and before these witnesses...

48:16.781 --> 48:19.784
...the betrothal of Charles,
Holy Roman Emperor...

48:20.034 --> 48:24.789
...and her Highness, Princess Mary,
upon her reaching the age of 12.

48:25.039 --> 48:26.332
I say to you again...

48:26.541 --> 48:29.752
...in my power as papal legate
and Chancellor of England...

48:30.003 --> 48:33.256
...that you should sign this treaty
of friendship, one to another...

48:33.464 --> 48:35.633
...and never break it,
so help you God.

49:08.166 --> 49:11.919
I swear to you
my honour and allegiance.

49:12.837 --> 49:16.758
You must always trust in me.
Always.

49:21.220 --> 49:24.557
Where is Mr. Pace?
He should have been here.

49:24.766 --> 49:28.936
Your Majesty,
I have discovered, shamefully...

49:29.145 --> 49:32.106
...that Mr. Pace was not deserving
of Your Majesty's trust.

49:32.315 --> 49:34.567
I have removed him from his offices.

49:35.652 --> 49:37.528
You're sure?

49:39.739 --> 49:42.658
The French were paying him
a pension.

49:47.622 --> 49:52.377
I see. I trust you will find me
a replacement.

49:58.091 --> 50:00.551
Well, how do our affairs proceed?

50:00.802 --> 50:02.512
Very well, Your Grace.

50:02.720 --> 50:05.056
The king makes
no obvious declaration of interest.

50:05.264 --> 50:08.309
But it's possible to detect it
in the way he glances at her...

50:08.518 --> 50:12.522
...as if, in his mind,
he could see her naked.

50:12.730 --> 50:15.191
Yes, well, he looks
at most young women that way.

50:15.441 --> 50:18.027
But it is a start.

50:18.236 --> 50:22.740
A beginning at least to the end
of that insufferable prelate.

50:23.282 --> 50:25.785
All in good time.

50:26.035 --> 50:27.787
One thing will follow another.

50:29.163 --> 50:30.790
Perhaps it would be a good idea...

50:30.998 --> 50:33.209
...to include
the Duke of Suffolk in our plans.

50:33.417 --> 50:37.296
Charles Brandon?
He is barely a gentleman.

50:37.505 --> 50:39.340
He's the king's closest friend.

50:39.590 --> 50:41.968
And I believe hates Wolsey
as much as we do.

50:43.553 --> 50:48.099
He would be a natural ally,
at least for a time.

51:02.655 --> 51:04.115
Attack!

51:04.740 --> 51:07.201
Two points for Mr. Anthony Knivert.

51:24.719 --> 51:29.056
Mr. Heys, do you have those pieces
I asked for?

51:29.265 --> 51:31.726
Yes, Your Majesty.

51:34.979 --> 51:37.857
One, rubies set in circlets of gold.

51:39.108 --> 51:44.196
A second, a precious stone
upon a bed of gold and pearl.

51:44.405 --> 51:49.827
Third, small and large drops of pearl,
with gold and purple...

51:50.036 --> 51:52.788
...and the detail of a lion's head.

51:52.997 --> 51:59.003
And lastly, feathers of silver,
gold and amber.

52:01.505 --> 52:05.801
Jewels fit for a queen, Your Majesty.

52:52.056 --> 52:54.308
It was Wolsey! It was Wolsey!

52:54.517 --> 52:56.060
Not me! Listen to me!

52:56.268 --> 52:58.396
It's Wolsey
who has a pension from the French.

52:58.604 --> 52:59.980
It's not me. Listen to me.

53:00.189 --> 53:02.066
I didn't do anything. I'm innocent.

53:02.274 --> 53:05.361
It was Wolsey. Wolsey. Wolsey.

53:05.569 --> 53:08.781
Just ask him! Ask him!
It was Wolsey!
