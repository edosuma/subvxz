00:11.934 --> 00:13.769
Respirations 36. 
Blood loss?

00:13.770 --> 00:15.285
Heavy. I placed an occlusive
dressing on his chest

00:15.286 --> 00:16.994
to seal the wound... smart move.

00:16.995 --> 00:18.425
And his SATs are in the lower 90s.

00:18.426 --> 00:21.146
All right. On my count.
One, two, three.

00:22.062 --> 00:23.407
Okay, guys. We got it from here.

00:23.822 --> 00:24.750
Okay.

00:25.875 --> 00:27.138
Nice job, rookie.

00:28.290 --> 00:30.640
Nothing sexier than
a man in uniform.

00:30.641 --> 00:31.730
Thank you.

00:31.735 --> 00:33.401
I think she was talking to me, bro.

00:33.402 --> 00:34.410
I know.

00:34.546 --> 00:37.489
I heard the call come in.
Ambulance five on its way.

00:38.109 --> 00:39.113
Yeah, I'd kiss you right now,

00:39.114 --> 00:40.721
but I'm kind of covered in blood.

00:40.722 --> 00:42.625
Yeah. Well, it's better than vomit,
though, right?

00:42.626 --> 00:44.930
Oh, no, we've had that today,
too. Ooh.

00:44.931 --> 00:46.790
Yeah, they should really tell
you about the sheer number

00:46.791 --> 00:49.702
of fluids you'll experience
in the paramedic handbook.

00:49.703 --> 00:52.390
Rookie, see ya in the rig, bro.
All right. Later.

00:54.154 --> 00:55.450
"The rig, bro"?

00:55.922 --> 00:59.186
Oh, he's cool. He's, uh,
kind of hazing the new guy.

00:59.229 --> 01:01.182
He's got me working a
double today, so...

01:01.183 --> 01:03.694
Ooh. What about bowling?

01:05.735 --> 01:07.757
Oh, no. Bowling is tonight.

01:07.758 --> 01:09.210
Yeah. It's fine. Annie, I'm sorry.

01:09.211 --> 01:10.974
It's... No, it's fine.
I'm not... You know what?

01:10.975 --> 01:12.797
I'm not even a good bowler, so...

01:13.054 --> 01:16.605
Annie, I'm sorry.
This job, it's just 24/7 and...

01:16.606 --> 01:18.238
I'm beginning to see that.

01:20.406 --> 01:23.494
How about lunch? Do they
give you guys lunch breaks.

01:24.186 --> 01:25.243
Oh.

01:26.103 --> 01:28.497
Yep, duty calls.
I will text you later.

01:28.498 --> 01:29.826
All right. Sorry.

01:34.543 --> 01:36.786
Of course, change is difficult,

01:36.787 --> 01:39.057
but keep up the good work.

01:39.058 --> 01:40.146
Thank you.

01:40.746 --> 01:42.421
Make mine to noradrenaline.

01:42.422 --> 01:43.542
Nora.

01:44.199 --> 01:46.866
You didn't have to stand in line.
I didn't. I cut in.

01:46.867 --> 01:48.130
Of course you did.

01:48.817 --> 01:50.737
Listen, why don't you,
um, have a seat?

01:50.911 --> 01:53.310
Really? Yeah. Come on.
Please. I insist.

01:53.311 --> 01:55.344
All right. Excuse me.

01:56.046 --> 01:58.553
Well, well, this is
all very impressive.

01:58.554 --> 02:00.970
The line is out the
door and down the block.

02:00.971 --> 02:02.901
You're, like, a sex symbol. Oh.

02:02.902 --> 02:03.841
What, am I dating

02:03.842 --> 02:05.987
the Robert Redford of psychiatry?

02:07.178 --> 02:09.226
Can you sign it to Trisha?

02:10.320 --> 02:11.669
Sure, Trisha.

02:11.670 --> 02:15.399
Your eyes are even more
magnetic in person.

02:15.458 --> 02:17.301
Oh... yeah.

02:17.302 --> 02:19.835
T-r-I-s-h-a, right?

02:20.293 --> 02:22.182
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

02:22.294 --> 02:25.415
Here is... your phone.

02:25.798 --> 02:27.893
You left it at my place last night.

02:27.894 --> 02:30.757
Oh, how careless of me.
Are we still on for tonight?

02:30.758 --> 02:33.494
Yeah, yeah, 8:00, uh,
8:00 P.M., right?

02:34.018 --> 02:37.150
"Antiques Roadshow," kung pao
chicken... You know what?

02:37.151 --> 02:39.074
We always do the same
thing every Friday night.

02:39.075 --> 02:40.917
I know you're a
stickler for routine,

02:40.918 --> 02:42.662
but how about I
roast you a chicken?

02:42.663 --> 02:44.481
And then we can watch your show if

02:44.482 --> 02:47.473
it means so much to you.
Her roast chicken is amazing.

02:47.819 --> 02:50.971
Her secret is putting
butter under the skin.

02:51.986 --> 02:54.341
You're "dear mom," right? 
Yes.

02:54.342 --> 02:55.957
I'm a big fan.

02:55.958 --> 02:56.854
No.

02:57.454 --> 03:00.511
The chicken really is to die for.

03:01.142 --> 03:02.775
Roast chicken it is.

03:03.483 --> 03:04.674
Thank you, Trisha.

03:04.675 --> 03:07.203
I'm so happy for you two.

03:09.620 --> 03:11.214
Are you blushing or
holding your breath?

03:11.215 --> 03:13.665
Take a guess.
You know what? I have to go.

03:13.666 --> 03:14.911
I will see you later tonight.

03:14.912 --> 03:16.837
Mm-hmm. Bye.

03:16.838 --> 03:18.694
Bye. Good-bye, ladies.

03:19.190 --> 03:21.031
Hello. How are you?

03:21.805 --> 03:23.455
It's important to be...

03:23.759 --> 03:25.170
Realistic.

03:25.171 --> 03:27.013
Realistic, that's right.

03:27.014 --> 03:29.209
The foster system isn't perfect.

03:29.210 --> 03:30.402
It's important to be honest

03:30.403 --> 03:33.138
about what types of cases
you're willing to take on.

03:33.810 --> 03:35.785
Now today, I'd like to get started

03:35.786 --> 03:39.590
with everyone's favorite...
Role-playing. Any volunteers?

03:39.591 --> 03:40.646
Oh. No, I don't want to.

03:40.647 --> 03:42.854
Um, Scotty, Kevin, come on up.

03:42.855 --> 03:45.124
Great. Why do you
always do this to us?

03:45.125 --> 03:47.380
I'm still traumatized
from the diaper Olympics.

03:47.619 --> 03:50.595
Okay, now have a seat
in our living room.

03:50.894 --> 03:53.933
And this is your son.

03:53.934 --> 03:56.382
Oh, great. We'll call him vinny.

03:56.562 --> 03:57.194
Vinny?

03:57.195 --> 04:00.554
There was a, uh, "Jersey Shore"
marathon on last night.

04:01.298 --> 04:02.786
Vinny's a nice name.

04:03.030 --> 04:05.206
Okay. I'm gonna be
playing myself. Ready?

04:07.029 --> 04:08.087
Knock, knock.

04:10.339 --> 04:11.714
Oh, hello, Jill.

04:12.190 --> 04:14.623
Mr. and Mr. Walker,

04:15.006 --> 04:16.913
I regret to inform
you that vinny's mom

04:16.914 --> 04:20.289
has decided to reclaim her
parental rights to her son.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.477
Well, that's ridiculous. We've
had vinny for over a month now,

04:23.478 --> 04:26.183
and she just wants him back? Scotty,
the law clearly states,

04:26.184 --> 04:28.272
the birth mother has 60
days to change her mind,

04:28.273 --> 04:30.685
so we have no choice.
Kevin, he's our son.

04:30.686 --> 04:32.862
I think what Jill
wants to see here is

04:32.863 --> 04:35.473
our ability to handle whatever
comes our way, including this.

04:35.474 --> 04:36.589
So why don't you give vinny to me?

04:36.590 --> 04:39.269
No, I'm sorry. This is wrong.
It's a doll, Scotty. Come on.

04:39.270 --> 04:41.894
Oh, Kevin, please,
stay in character. Yeah.

04:41.946 --> 04:45.243
Okay. Would you guys like
to say your good-byes now?

04:46.178 --> 04:48.675
Isn't there anything else we can do?
I'm afraid there isn't.

04:51.836 --> 04:53.089
Okay, Mr. practical,

04:53.142 --> 04:54.118
you handle it.

04:57.642 --> 04:58.826
I'm, um...

05:00.007 --> 05:01.706
I'm sorry it didn't work out,
vinny. Good-bye.

05:01.707 --> 05:02.666
Oh...

05:03.528 --> 05:04.793
Oh, okay.

05:06.878 --> 05:08.531
All right, you little monkey,

05:08.764 --> 05:11.515
papa Scotty and I,
we... we love you very much,

05:11.657 --> 05:14.763
but your mom has changed her
mind and wants you back.

05:15.070 --> 05:16.190
So...

05:21.907 --> 05:24.018
As much as it breaks
our hearts to say this,

05:25.064 --> 05:26.214
we have to let you go.

05:30.238 --> 05:32.670
You'll never know how much
we wanted to keep you.

05:34.551 --> 05:35.847
Make sure she's good to him.

05:41.503 --> 05:43.662
Wow. Does everyone cry
or just the gay dads?

05:51.318 --> 05:52.976
Your, uh, your phone's ringing.

05:52.977 --> 05:55.427
I know. I know. It always rings.

05:57.059 --> 05:59.730
Okay. Mm.

06:00.258 --> 06:03.266
Wait. That's my phone.
It never rings. Ignore it.

06:03.469 --> 06:05.853
Obviously. Mm.

06:06.750 --> 06:08.143
Mm.

06:08.742 --> 06:12.750
Mm. Oh, my God. I don't believe it.

06:15.082 --> 06:16.779
It's my editor?
My high school lab partner?

06:17.576 --> 06:18.665
They can wait. Yeah.

06:18.666 --> 06:19.994
Yeah. Oh. Mm.

06:25.012 --> 06:26.580
I give up. I give up.

06:28.699 --> 06:29.692
Sarah? My cousin hal?

06:29.693 --> 06:31.951
Probably calling me from
her business trip. What?

06:32.419 --> 06:33.857
Hey, Sarah. Hal, long time, man.

06:33.858 --> 06:36.386
So what, did somebody die? What?

06:36.495 --> 06:37.323
"The Huffington Post"?
What do you mean,

06:37.324 --> 06:38.450
it's all over the Internet?

06:38.456 --> 06:41.612
No. No. H-how many hits? Um,
okay, uh, uh, look, I-I-I...

06:41.613 --> 06:42.526
I gotta go.

06:43.646 --> 06:44.790
Somebody told something and
it's all over the Internet...

06:44.791 --> 06:46.185
...Leaked the story about
us seeing each other...

06:46.186 --> 06:47.851
That we...
I know. It's gone viral.

06:50.334 --> 06:52.070
Oh. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

06:52.071 --> 06:53.830
This is Kevin. He's texting me.

06:53.895 --> 06:57.321
"The skinny minnie web
site picked up the story,

06:57.322 --> 06:58.473
and there's a picture."

06:58.474 --> 07:01.403
What? Oh, no.

07:01.599 --> 07:02.655
What?

07:02.878 --> 07:04.699
You look like you're
16 in that picture.

07:05.791 --> 07:09.275
Uh, that's because I am
16 in that picture. Oh.

07:09.276 --> 07:11.790
This is my high
school yearbook photo.

07:11.791 --> 07:13.971
Shut up. What was I thinking?

07:14.198 --> 07:15.585
Of course this was gonna blow up.

07:15.586 --> 07:18.797
I mean, I'm dating the dean's son.

07:18.798 --> 07:21.049
This... this was never
gonna be a secret.

07:21.362 --> 07:22.329
Yeah, but I mean, come on,

07:22.330 --> 07:24.825
you used to spin things
for a living, right?

07:24.826 --> 07:26.261
I mean, how hard can it be?

07:26.262 --> 07:28.142
We just deny it.
No, you don't deny it.

07:28.143 --> 07:30.840
The cover-up is worse than the crime.
Dating me is a crime now?

07:30.841 --> 07:32.845
No. No, not literally.

07:32.846 --> 07:34.654
It... thank God.

07:36.288 --> 07:37.231
Oh.

07:39.290 --> 07:40.438
What is that?

07:40.439 --> 07:43.015
It's a personalized ringtone.

07:43.243 --> 07:44.298
Whose?

07:44.694 --> 07:47.334
My mother. Your mother's?

07:48.478 --> 07:50.261
Oh, turn it... turn it off.

07:50.262 --> 07:51.383
Okay. Um...

07:51.562 --> 07:53.354
There. There. She's, uh, gone.

07:53.510 --> 07:54.662
Well, good.

07:56.391 --> 07:57.446
Oh.

07:59.354 --> 08:00.858
It's your mother, isn't it?

08:01.337 --> 08:02.091
Yeah.

08:02.092 --> 08:05.240
Ugh. Damn it. Okay. You don't
have to talk to her, all right?

08:05.241 --> 08:06.861
Let me handle this.
You're very sweet,

08:06.862 --> 08:09.246
but it was my decision
to be discreet,

08:09.247 --> 08:10.505
so it's my fault.

08:10.506 --> 08:12.633
So whatever she has to say,
I can take it.

08:13.318 --> 08:14.439
Hold my hand.

08:15.270 --> 08:16.215
Hello.

08:16.942 --> 08:19.678
Yes, yes. Hi. Hi, dean whitley.

08:19.825 --> 08:20.850
Uh-huh.

08:22.381 --> 08:24.766
Uh, sure. Okay. Thank you.

08:28.202 --> 08:29.444
She wants to see me...

08:30.511 --> 08:31.742
Today.

08:33.000 --> 08:39.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:43.142 --> 08:44.589
Why doesn't she call?

08:44.590 --> 08:47.033
Because she's probably
too busy reading this.

08:47.034 --> 08:50.217
"Kitty Walker McCallister and
son of dean in sex scandal."

08:50.218 --> 08:53.189
Where are you reading this crap?
The online political rags.

08:53.190 --> 08:55.668
They're calling Seth her
"boy toy barista."

08:55.947 --> 08:59.321
Oh, my God. It's completely absurd.

08:59.390 --> 09:03.317
I mean, Kitty is...
is not even a politician anymore.

09:03.318 --> 09:03.857
I know.

09:03.858 --> 09:05.813
I can't believe the attention
she's getting either.

09:05.814 --> 09:09.350
She's even trending on Twitter.
It's like the good ol' days.

09:09.497 --> 09:11.768
Oh, wow. Look at
this picture of him.

09:12.459 --> 09:14.054
He looks like the sixth
member of 'Nsync.

09:14.055 --> 09:15.884
Aw. Oh, crap-o.

09:16.604 --> 09:18.604
"After robbing the dean's cradle,

09:18.874 --> 09:22.057
"Kitty m... or should I say
cougar Walker McCallister,

09:22.058 --> 09:23.569
"has been teaching
at Wexley university

09:23.570 --> 09:26.094
for the past month"...
Stop. Stop.

09:26.095 --> 09:29.593
You're practically salivating,
reading all this trash. Sorry.

09:29.594 --> 09:31.873
Guess I didn't realize how
much I miss political scandal.

09:31.874 --> 09:33.602
Oh, I have something for you.

09:35.218 --> 09:37.967
Here. This is your
letter of recommendation.

09:37.968 --> 09:39.332
Oh. Give it to your social worker.

09:39.333 --> 09:42.802
I hope you're a better father
than you are a brother. Ouch.

09:42.803 --> 09:43.587
Yeah.

09:44.351 --> 09:47.974
Is that Kitty? "O.M.G.
O.M.G. Paparazzi at my house."

09:47.975 --> 09:50.854
Paparazzi? My God.
The world has gone mad.

09:51.395 --> 09:53.826
"Have you talked to mom yet?
" Give me the phone.

09:53.827 --> 09:56.081
No, it takes you, like,
five minutes to type "hello."

09:56.325 --> 10:00.679
I'm with mom right now. Sending
all our support and love...

10:00.886 --> 10:02.152
And acne cream.

10:02.153 --> 10:03.449
Kevin.

10:03.890 --> 10:05.949
What did she say?
"Screw you, Kevin."

10:05.950 --> 10:09.345
Aha. Tell her this is
completely ridiculous.

10:09.346 --> 10:11.585
She is allowed to date
whomever she wants.

10:11.586 --> 10:13.093
Type it. Go. Type it. Okay.

10:13.094 --> 10:16.693
And besides that, you know,
Seth is really a nice boy.

10:18.057 --> 10:19.113
Man.

10:19.734 --> 10:20.604
What? What does she say?

10:20.605 --> 10:22.961
"Can I come to mom's tonight?
Safer there."

10:22.962 --> 10:25.853
Yes. Tell her yes, yes.

10:25.854 --> 10:29.789
Karl is coming, too, but he's
just gonna have to deal with it.

10:29.923 --> 10:31.465
Tell her to bring Seth.

10:31.466 --> 10:33.402
Well, now I want to come, too.

10:33.467 --> 10:34.926
No. What?

10:34.927 --> 10:36.145
Absolutely not.

10:36.146 --> 10:38.468
You'll spend the whole
evening making fun of her.

10:38.469 --> 10:41.094
I won't. What does she say?

10:42.157 --> 10:44.160
"Ask mom if you can come, too."

10:44.834 --> 10:46.017
Oh, all right.

10:46.018 --> 10:47.474
Everybody can come.

10:48.131 --> 10:49.171
Great.

10:50.770 --> 10:51.826
Um...

10:52.602 --> 10:54.385
Karl does like us, right?

10:54.386 --> 10:55.394
Yes.

10:56.042 --> 10:58.333
Yes. He likes you very much.

10:58.334 --> 10:59.503
Good.

10:59.770 --> 11:00.786
In moderation.

11:00.787 --> 11:02.826
Oh. Uh-oh.

11:02.827 --> 11:03.771
Look, would you do me a favor

11:03.772 --> 11:06.462
and please be on your
best behavior tonight?

11:06.463 --> 11:09.853
He... he never had a family before.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.258
So you're gonna start
him off on ours?

11:13.057 --> 11:14.674
It's the only one I've got.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.099
Well, tell him to drink more.

11:16.135 --> 11:20.128
Look, Karl is a wonderful,
highly intelligent man.

11:20.129 --> 11:23.125
All right. Okay.
He... he's a little stiff.

11:23.126 --> 11:26.634
But he... h-he wants
to try to change.

11:26.635 --> 11:28.121
Well, then tonight should be fun.

11:28.886 --> 11:29.877
Yeah.

11:30.537 --> 11:33.275
Ooh. "Later.
I'm off to see the dean."

11:35.319 --> 11:36.374
What are you writing?

11:37.034 --> 11:38.426
Have fun in detention.

11:39.450 --> 11:40.598
So you're gonna want
to put the needles

11:40.599 --> 11:42.278
in one of the drawers with latches.

11:42.354 --> 11:43.145
Last thing you want is

11:43.146 --> 11:45.788
a bunch of sharps flying
out at 65 miles per,

11:45.913 --> 11:47.332
unless you're a ninja, I guess.

11:47.333 --> 11:48.902
Yeah, sorry, Dan.

11:49.259 --> 11:51.322
But I do know how to fire an m16.

11:52.134 --> 11:53.323
I like you, man.

11:53.758 --> 11:55.039
You're doing good so far.

11:57.226 --> 11:59.451
That nurse chick definitely
thought you were the man.

11:59.858 --> 12:01.041
Nurse chick?

12:01.150 --> 12:04.841
Dude, please. You were so playin'
up the hero thing. I was not.

12:04.842 --> 12:07.133
You hittin' that? Classy.

12:07.134 --> 12:09.906
Yes! You are. I knew it. Dude,
you know what? Relax, all right?

12:09.907 --> 12:11.907
Good one. We're just
taking it casual.

12:11.911 --> 12:13.256
Really? Yeah.

12:13.294 --> 12:15.072
Because I would be
spending all my free time

12:15.073 --> 12:17.553
with a beautiful creature like that.
Well, okay, what free time?

12:18.264 --> 12:20.532
Dude, you're the one taking
all the shifts from everyone,

12:20.533 --> 12:23.569
working all the time.
You can pull it back a little.

12:23.570 --> 12:25.075
Being a paramedic's
what I want to do,

12:25.076 --> 12:26.514
and it took me a long
time to figure that out,

12:26.515 --> 12:29.525
so if that means pulling doubles
or working the night shift

12:29.526 --> 12:32.358
where I can't go bowling,
that's what I'm gonna do.

12:32.530 --> 12:34.488
Okay, but if she feels neglected

12:34.489 --> 12:37.414
and starts, I don't know,
looking for comfort elsewhere,

12:37.415 --> 12:41.665
in maybe a funnier, slightly
more desperate man in uniform,

12:41.666 --> 12:43.058
don't say I didn't warn you.

12:43.264 --> 12:45.234
You know, you should really take
this act on the road. All units,

12:45.235 --> 12:48.776
we have a small house fire in
the 6000 block of willoughby.

12:48.777 --> 12:49.506
Smoke inhalation, minor burns.

12:49.507 --> 12:50.765
Feel like roasting
some marshmallows?

12:50.766 --> 12:52.206
Hell, yes. Who's responding?

12:52.922 --> 12:54.945
Dispatch, this is unit five.
We're on our way.

13:01.717 --> 13:02.518
Hello.

13:03.443 --> 13:05.619
Hello, Kitty. Have a seat.

13:07.174 --> 13:08.058
Thank you.

13:10.871 --> 13:13.014
I feel like I'm at the
principal's office.

13:13.718 --> 13:16.438
Uh, I-I really am very sorry

13:16.647 --> 13:19.315
that you had to find out
about Seth and me like this.

13:19.316 --> 13:21.738
And I understand that
I have put the school

13:21.739 --> 13:23.276
in a compromised position,

13:23.277 --> 13:26.300
and if there is anything that I
could possibly do... Kitty, relax.

13:27.671 --> 13:30.321
The fact that my son is
dating an attractive professor

13:30.322 --> 13:33.262
probably enhanced our
reputation among applicants.

13:33.263 --> 13:33.936
Oh, well...

13:33.937 --> 13:36.330
Obviously, there's so
much to find at Wexley

13:36.331 --> 13:38.090
in addition to an education.

13:40.059 --> 13:41.994
I want you to know that
I'm making a statement

13:42.214 --> 13:43.941
supporting you and Seth.

13:44.355 --> 13:46.851
Really? Wow. Well, thank you.

13:47.379 --> 13:50.614
I-I want you to know that
I do care about your son.

13:50.615 --> 13:53.286
Well, Seth's 27 years old.
He can date whomever he wants.

13:53.287 --> 13:57.206
And I can certainly see why
he would be interested in you.

13:57.811 --> 14:00.402
Thank you. But I have to admit,
I'm a little surprised

14:00.403 --> 14:03.413
that you are interested in him.

14:03.962 --> 14:06.218
Oh, well, he's... he's a great guy.

14:06.219 --> 14:10.458
Yes, but... you had a
radio and television show.

14:10.590 --> 14:13.163
You ran for the
United States senate.

14:13.164 --> 14:16.286
You are a passionate,
ambitious woman.

14:16.827 --> 14:18.866
And Seth, well, he's...

14:18.867 --> 14:20.400
He's working on his master's.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.803
Oh, yes, yes, yes,
for the past five years.

14:22.804 --> 14:24.548
He's making a career of it.

14:25.045 --> 14:29.166
I also hear that he is writing
short stories and a novel,

14:29.167 --> 14:33.358
but... he still carries
a backpack, Kitty.

14:34.635 --> 14:37.429
Well, actually,
it's a messenger bag.

14:37.430 --> 14:39.477
But Seth works very hard...

14:39.478 --> 14:40.761
Kitty, be honest.

14:40.762 --> 14:43.930
Is Seth really someone you
see yourself with long-term?

14:45.491 --> 14:47.515
I'm not willing to
discuss that with you,

14:47.516 --> 14:49.322
and thank you very
much for the statement,

14:49.323 --> 14:50.746
but for the record,

14:51.918 --> 14:54.225
Seth and I are very
happy at the moment.

14:54.407 --> 14:55.486
Well, I'm sure you are.

14:55.487 --> 14:57.365
Nonetheless, I can't help but think

14:57.366 --> 15:00.647
that the reason you're keeping
this relationship discreet

15:01.046 --> 15:03.446
is not because of me or Wexley,

15:03.835 --> 15:06.042
but because you know
you can do better.

15:09.453 --> 15:11.616
I don't think that
continuing this conversation

15:11.617 --> 15:13.528
is going to be particularly
productive, so...

15:13.529 --> 15:15.397
Look, it's your life.
It's not mine.

15:15.398 --> 15:17.574
You can make whatever
mistakes you want.

15:18.126 --> 15:20.510
I just think I know
Seth better than you.

15:21.390 --> 15:22.494
Maybe.

15:23.995 --> 15:26.444
But for his sake,
I hope that's not true.

15:28.559 --> 15:29.662
Excuse me.

15:38.489 --> 15:41.211
And that's around the world.

15:41.458 --> 15:43.033
I just kicked your ass.

15:43.034 --> 15:44.576
All right, listen, whatever, cocky.

15:44.577 --> 15:45.688
Let's not forget who won at horse.

15:45.689 --> 15:47.336
Oh, please. I let you win that.

15:47.337 --> 15:48.462
Didn't want to hurt
your manly pride.

15:48.463 --> 15:50.207
Yeah, sure you did. Sure you did.

15:50.250 --> 15:53.181
Well, how about this...
One shot, double or nothing,

15:53.182 --> 15:55.265
and let's see how good you are
when you're being guarded?

15:55.321 --> 15:56.315
Done.

15:56.350 --> 15:58.286
Little bit different of
a ball game now, huh?

15:58.287 --> 15:59.297
Really? Yeah.

15:59.298 --> 16:03.494
I like a challenge. Get outta my way.
Let's go. Let's go.

16:03.723 --> 16:05.451
Oh! Oh!

16:05.483 --> 16:07.051
You made me miss that.

16:07.071 --> 16:08.350
Yeah, you're right.

16:10.691 --> 16:11.938
All right. Let's get a sandwich.

16:13.654 --> 16:14.982
Lunch is over, rookie.

16:15.543 --> 16:17.270
We have a call over
by the country club.

16:17.274 --> 16:19.497
Uh, yeah, Dan, uh, I'm on my way.

16:19.707 --> 16:21.792
I gotta go. Well,
you haven't even eaten yet.

16:21.793 --> 16:23.144
Yeah. Welcome to my lunch breaks.

16:23.145 --> 16:24.905
Look, grab a sandwich
and I'll call you later.

16:28.917 --> 16:29.862
Wait a second.

16:30.842 --> 16:32.951
What if I came with you?

16:34.335 --> 16:35.743
What, on my job?

16:35.910 --> 16:37.045
Yeah. I mean, nurses are

16:37.046 --> 16:39.349
supposed to do ride-alongs
with paramedics once a year.

16:39.350 --> 16:40.338
I was gonna do it next month,

16:40.339 --> 16:44.754
but what if I went tonight
instead? Seriously?

16:44.819 --> 16:47.684
Yeah. I mean, it's really
the only way I'm gonna get

16:47.685 --> 16:49.047
a couple of straight
hours with you.

16:50.618 --> 16:52.520
Uh... Annie, I don't...
I don't know if th...

16:52.521 --> 16:55.226
Come on. I promise you,
I will not get in your way.

16:57.772 --> 16:58.828
Scout's honor.

17:02.146 --> 17:02.861
Okay.

17:02.862 --> 17:04.788
Come here. I'll text you later.

17:04.789 --> 17:06.147
And work on that hook shot.

17:09.846 --> 17:11.703
Everything seems to be in order.

17:12.154 --> 17:14.634
Excellent letters
of recommendation.

17:16.705 --> 17:18.354
You indicated here
in your preferences

17:18.355 --> 17:20.613
that you'd be willing
to consider any case,

17:20.614 --> 17:22.564
regardless of gender, race, or age?

17:22.565 --> 17:23.791
That's right. When we started this,

17:23.792 --> 17:25.858
we were working with a
surrogate, and, um...

17:25.922 --> 17:28.165
I don't know if it's because
that didn't work out,

17:28.166 --> 17:31.678
but we're more interested
in being parents

17:31.766 --> 17:33.557
rather than passing on our genes.

17:33.559 --> 17:34.871
You're doing a great thing.

17:37.358 --> 17:39.085
Okay, I know this is quick,

17:39.086 --> 17:41.518
but there's an
adoption fair tomorrow,

17:41.519 --> 17:42.989
if you guys are interested.

17:43.157 --> 17:44.194
Uh, what's that?

17:44.195 --> 17:46.181
It's an event where
potential parents

17:46.182 --> 17:48.014
can meet and interact with children

17:48.015 --> 17:50.048
who are looking to be
placed into families.

17:50.637 --> 17:54.190
There are 30,000 kids in
foster care here in L.A.

17:54.623 --> 17:56.750
I'll give you two a minute to talk.

17:57.279 --> 17:58.366
Just let me know.

17:59.883 --> 18:01.065
Thank you.

18:09.802 --> 18:11.717
What? You... you look nervous.

18:11.718 --> 18:13.932
No, no, no, no. I'm excited.

18:13.933 --> 18:16.275
It's just, I... I don't know.

18:16.276 --> 18:17.941
I thought... I guess I expected

18:17.942 --> 18:20.897
we'd be getting a phone
call and a placement.

18:20.898 --> 18:23.129
But n-now, what,
we have to meet a bunch of kids

18:23.130 --> 18:24.714
and figure it out?

18:24.715 --> 18:27.472
Well, I mean, you heard
what Jill said. 30,000 kids.

18:27.473 --> 18:29.915
Exactly, so how do we
choose the right one?

18:37.366 --> 18:37.977
Hey.

18:37.978 --> 18:39.078
Hey. You know there are, uh,

18:39.334 --> 18:40.826
still two guys out
there with cameras?

18:40.827 --> 18:42.189
Ugh. I hope you ignored them.

18:42.190 --> 18:44.911
Actually, I mooned them.
I so wish you did.

18:45.893 --> 18:48.117
Hey, check out what I,
uh, brought Evan.

18:48.270 --> 18:50.703
It's the hulk. Right?

18:53.551 --> 18:54.860
Wow. That's really sweet.

18:54.861 --> 18:59.262
I-I had no idea that you
still played with toys.

18:59.409 --> 19:01.682
Well, it's more of a...

19:01.973 --> 19:03.652
Collectible, really.

19:05.155 --> 19:06.018
So...

19:07.278 --> 19:08.313
What'd my mom say?

19:08.314 --> 19:10.986
I told you. She was great.
Still don't believe you.

19:10.987 --> 19:13.764
Seth, did you read the
statement that she released?

19:13.765 --> 19:17.092
I mean, she was practically gushing.
Oh, no, no, no.

19:17.093 --> 19:20.598
See, that was just to save
the honor of... of Wexley.

19:20.635 --> 19:21.671
What did she say to you?

19:21.672 --> 19:23.398
Because, you know,
sometimes, you have to... to

19:23.667 --> 19:26.818
read between the lines to really
appreciate her guilt trip.

19:26.819 --> 19:28.238
You know, she once told me

19:28.459 --> 19:29.865
that she wasn't
making me feel guilty.

19:29.866 --> 19:32.893
She was just helping me find
the guilt already within.

19:32.894 --> 19:34.635
Sweet, huh? I'm sure that you have

19:34.685 --> 19:36.595
a very complicated
relationship with her,

19:36.596 --> 19:39.538
but with me, she was...
perfectly professional, right?

19:39.833 --> 19:42.390
She was. You look hot, by the way.

19:42.602 --> 19:45.178
Well, thank you.
Thank you. So... so do...

19:45.483 --> 19:48.155
Uh, you know,
I've never been to Phoenix.

19:48.673 --> 19:49.618
Oh.

19:49.870 --> 19:51.567
Uh, that's a... that's a band.

19:52.290 --> 19:54.274
Oh. Oh, right.

19:54.285 --> 19:55.534
Right. Sorry.

19:55.818 --> 19:58.194
So, you know, I was
actually thinking that, um,

19:58.195 --> 19:59.666
maybe we shouldn't go tonight.

19:59.667 --> 20:02.419
I mean, between Karl's
psychiatry talk,

20:02.420 --> 20:03.617
and Kevin's lawyer talk,

20:03.618 --> 20:06.170
and my mother and Scotty
exchanging recipes,

20:06.171 --> 20:09.992
it's just, it's... it's...
it's... it's snorefest.

20:11.442 --> 20:13.667
Are you... are you
trying to get out of it?

20:13.668 --> 20:15.577
No. No. I just...

20:15.578 --> 20:18.622
Have you really been going to
grad school for five years?

20:18.623 --> 20:20.451
Oh. See? She did say something.

20:20.452 --> 20:22.945
No, she didn't.
I was just wondering

20:22.946 --> 20:25.442
because it actually does
seem like a very long time.

20:25.443 --> 20:27.563
Look, I haven't
finished my thesis yet,

20:27.564 --> 20:28.952
and I told you, I've been
working on this novel.

20:28.953 --> 20:30.889
And... and if either of you

20:30.890 --> 20:31.839
have a problem with that then...
You know what?

20:31.840 --> 20:34.261
Don't put your mother
and me on the same team,

20:34.262 --> 20:37.597
because I actually think that
your priorities are great.

20:38.580 --> 20:40.754
Great. She got to you.
No, she didn't.

20:40.755 --> 20:43.142
In fact, I-I stood up for you.

20:45.317 --> 20:46.029
Really?

20:46.337 --> 20:47.124
Really.

20:47.861 --> 20:49.540
So can you please
stop being paranoid?

20:49.541 --> 20:51.664
And can we go?
Because we're gonna be late.

20:53.325 --> 20:54.051
Look...

20:54.625 --> 20:55.551
Kitty, I mean...

20:55.552 --> 20:57.725
I've got my keys, so...

20:58.462 --> 21:01.033
I am so glad you're here.

21:01.034 --> 21:02.980
This is gonna be so much fun,

21:02.981 --> 21:04.965
so much better than any old take...

21:04.966 --> 21:08.073
Ooh. There is my pie.
Pie?

21:08.074 --> 21:09.121
What pie?

21:09.559 --> 21:11.785
Well, it's...
it's not a pupu platter,

21:11.786 --> 21:14.535
but... I wanted
everything to be nice.

21:15.561 --> 21:17.411
Nora, why are there
six place settings

21:17.412 --> 21:18.507
in the dining room?

21:18.794 --> 21:19.497
Well...

21:21.082 --> 21:23.155
That would be for Kevin and Scotty

21:23.156 --> 21:24.418
and Kitty and Seth.

21:24.419 --> 21:26.321
And Seth. He's the...
the college student

21:26.322 --> 21:27.812
that Kitty's seeing, right?

21:27.813 --> 21:29.759
He's the graduate
student that Kitty is...

21:29.760 --> 21:32.104
You met him, remember?
Yeah, I do remember him.

21:32.105 --> 21:33.366
I just don't remember inviting him

21:33.367 --> 21:36.790
to dinner tonight. No. No.
I-I-I did that. Just...

21:36.791 --> 21:39.058
They're going through so much,
and I thought it would be...

21:39.059 --> 21:42.678
You thought you'd just bring
the storm to us, right?

21:42.679 --> 21:44.590
Karl, she is my daughter.

21:44.591 --> 21:46.728
Yes, and Kevin is your son,
yes, but...

21:46.729 --> 21:48.743
Look, if it all gets
to be too much for you,

21:48.744 --> 21:51.808
we can just go off by ourselves and watch
"Antiques Roadshow"...

21:51.809 --> 21:53.693
no, no, no. No,
I don't want you to think

21:53.694 --> 21:54.930
that I'm obsessed with that show,

21:54.931 --> 21:58.365
it's just that I thought tonight...
That tonight...

21:58.853 --> 22:00.690
It was just the two of us.

22:02.078 --> 22:03.065
I know. I...

22:03.902 --> 22:06.807
Look, I want you to feel
a part of my family.

22:06.808 --> 22:08.547
You haven't seen
them since Christmas.

22:08.548 --> 22:09.302
Right.

22:10.380 --> 22:11.940
I don't know. I-I just...

22:12.940 --> 22:16.267
I felt so proud,
being with you today

22:16.268 --> 22:17.614
at the book signing.

22:18.357 --> 22:19.195
Nora.

22:21.171 --> 22:21.937
You know...

22:22.875 --> 22:25.161
I could call them and
tell them not to come.

22:25.542 --> 22:27.642
No, no. Tonight's fine.

22:28.135 --> 22:30.596
Obviously, I'm too
much of a control freak

22:30.597 --> 22:33.347
to have, uh,
had my own children, so...

22:34.434 --> 22:35.497
The least I can do

22:36.772 --> 22:39.871
is to learn to be
friends with yours.

22:40.246 --> 22:41.237
Thank you.

22:41.238 --> 22:43.038
You're welcome. Mwah.

22:43.208 --> 22:45.367
Thank you. Mm.

22:45.368 --> 22:47.164
I still can't believe that woman

22:47.165 --> 22:50.639
made us come to her house
to change her tv channel.

22:51.315 --> 22:53.744
Some emergency. Yeah, well,
what about the chick

22:53.745 --> 22:55.618
who was choking on
the mozzarella stick?

22:55.619 --> 22:58.647
Oh, yeah. Hey, hey,
those things are death traps.

22:58.648 --> 23:00.471
We got a car crash at
hill and orange grove.

23:00.472 --> 23:03.059
Who's responding? Hey, we're
just a few blocks from there.

23:03.060 --> 23:05.447
Dispatch, this is unit five.
We're on our way.

23:05.448 --> 23:08.673
Unit five, be advised,
there are possible fatalities.

23:23.839 --> 23:25.084
Michael. Michael.

23:25.085 --> 23:26.335
Okay, let's prep to extricate.

23:26.336 --> 23:29.035
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be fine.

23:33.675 --> 23:35.452
Please. My husband.
Please help him.

23:35.453 --> 23:36.155
Sure. Are... are you okay?

23:36.156 --> 23:38.199
My shoulder... it's from
the seat belt. It's okay.

23:38.200 --> 23:39.491
But please just help him.
All right.

23:39.492 --> 23:40.723
I've got her. You got him, rookie?

23:40.724 --> 23:41.714
I got him. I'll go with you.

23:41.715 --> 23:42.677
All right, what's going on?

23:42.678 --> 23:44.563
Yeah, he's pinned under
the steering wheel.

23:44.564 --> 23:48.602
We're gonna have to cut him out.
All right, sir. How you doing?

23:48.756 --> 23:52.116
Can you hear me? Can you get his head?
Leah, my wife...

23:52.117 --> 23:54.492
Is she okay? Oh, she's great.
She's great.

23:54.493 --> 23:56.584
She's looking really good.
Annie, you just saw her, right?

23:56.585 --> 23:58.333
Yeah, she's gonna be just fine.
Oh, God. Oh.

23:58.334 --> 24:00.384
You gave her a little scare,
getting stuck in here.

24:01.771 --> 24:03.155
His breathing is labored.

24:03.156 --> 24:04.929
Let's get him some o-2
and ready for transport.

24:04.930 --> 24:08.186
Got it. All right.
What's your name?

24:08.498 --> 24:09.457
Michael.

24:09.458 --> 24:12.246
Mariah? That's weird.
No, I'm kidding Michael.

24:12.497 --> 24:13.709
My name's Justin.

24:14.122 --> 24:15.134
Justin.

24:17.959 --> 24:20.795
Karl had the most wonderful
book signing today.

24:20.796 --> 24:22.448
It was like Robert
Redford came to town.

24:22.449 --> 24:24.141
Oh, which one's Robert Redford?

24:24.142 --> 24:26.480
Oh, Butch Cassidy, Sundance Kid.

24:26.481 --> 24:28.693
"The Way We Were," 
Barbra Streisand. Mm.

24:29.331 --> 24:31.577
Don't tell me you don't know
who Barbra Streisand is.

24:31.578 --> 24:34.482
Uh, news flash.
He's straight, Kevin.

24:34.483 --> 24:36.466
No, no, no, um,
"The Way We Were," right.

24:36.467 --> 24:38.007
My mom, uh, my mom
loves Barbra Streisand.

24:38.008 --> 24:40.424
Oh. How's she doing,
your mother? Oh, she's not happy.

24:40.425 --> 24:41.619
Oh, she was actually quite lovely.

24:43.144 --> 24:44.082
Which one is it?

24:46.270 --> 24:48.731
Karl, you like Barbra Streisand,
too, don't you?

24:49.056 --> 24:49.795
Yes.

24:53.606 --> 24:54.739
Karl, what's your book called?

24:54.740 --> 24:56.628
"The Empowered Unconscious."

24:56.889 --> 25:00.547
Oh. It's about using your
past to really guide you...

25:00.548 --> 25:01.471
I'm sure they're not interested

25:01.472 --> 25:03.822
in my little self-help book, Nora.

25:04.097 --> 25:07.636
Self-help? No, I would
write a self-help book.

25:07.637 --> 25:09.189
But it's quite brilliant,

25:09.190 --> 25:10.789
and filled with these
wonderful little...

25:10.790 --> 25:13.045
Uh, this chicken is delicious.

25:14.464 --> 25:15.034
Thank you.

25:15.035 --> 25:17.002
Mom can make roast chicken
like peanut butter and jelly.

25:17.003 --> 25:18.458
She can do it in her sleep.

25:18.783 --> 25:21.244
Well, uh, I've been having
a lot of pb&js these days,

25:21.245 --> 25:23.957
and let me tell you,
this is a lot better.

25:24.145 --> 25:26.505
Well, Seth,
you can come over anytime.

25:26.506 --> 25:27.960
I would be delighted
to make you... No,

25:27.961 --> 25:30.178
no, mom. Mom,
he's just... he's just joking.

25:30.179 --> 25:32.427
He doesn't have that many pb&js.

25:32.428 --> 25:35.093
He eats a lot of food.
He likes a lot of food.

25:35.094 --> 25:38.198
He likes, um,
you like sushi, right?

25:38.888 --> 25:41.632
Um, yeah, yeah. I-I like sushi.

25:41.633 --> 25:42.594
Um, it's expensive, so I can't,

25:42.595 --> 25:44.351
uh... How is the
adoption going, guys?

25:44.352 --> 25:47.158
Fine. It's great.
Well, actually, we are thinking

25:47.159 --> 25:48.875
about going to an
adoption fair tomorrow.

25:48.876 --> 25:51.513
What's an adoption fair?
Why don't you tell 'em, Scotty?

25:52.477 --> 25:55.443
Well, uh, it's a fair
where prospective parents

25:55.444 --> 25:57.088
get to meet with
kids that need homes.

25:57.089 --> 25:59.700
Yeah, about 20, descending
on you at the same time,

25:59.701 --> 26:00.543
because that makes it so much

26:00.544 --> 26:02.714
easier to bond with...
Stop being so dramatic.

26:02.715 --> 26:04.748
I'm not. I'm sorry.
I just find the whole thing weird.

26:04.749 --> 26:06.176
And I can't imagine
how it feels for them.

26:06.177 --> 26:07.582
They must feel like
they're being sold,

26:07.583 --> 26:11.426
like puppies in a window.
Kevin, there's no need to shout.

26:11.447 --> 26:13.644
I'm not shouting. Karl, have

26:13.645 --> 26:16.409
you ever done any studies
about foster adoptions?

26:16.812 --> 26:17.585
Mnh-mnh.

26:22.213 --> 26:23.326
Well, maybe you could do one

26:23.327 --> 26:24.813
on the children who
don't get picked.

26:24.814 --> 26:26.100
I'm sure that would
be a happy ending.

26:26.101 --> 26:27.648
Kevin, it's a way
for people like us

26:27.649 --> 26:29.700
to get introduced to kids
that are stuck in the system.

26:29.701 --> 26:33.275
Come on. Let's... let's just
talk about something else.

26:34.763 --> 26:36.103
Would anyone like
some more chicken?

26:36.104 --> 26:37.188
Oh, God, no. Thanks.

26:37.189 --> 26:40.374
Yeah. I'd love some. Finally.
Someone with an appetite.

26:40.375 --> 26:41.806
Well, he has been living on pb&js,

26:41.807 --> 26:44.087
mom. He has not been
living on pb&js, Kevin.

26:44.088 --> 26:46.093
Well, you know,
that and ramen noodles, right?

26:47.891 --> 26:49.103
Uh, I'm... I'm kidding.

26:52.504 --> 26:53.953
My parents live near Phoenix.

26:53.954 --> 26:55.628
Hmm? Your...

26:55.629 --> 26:58.415
Oh. Uh, no. It's, um, it's a band.

26:58.416 --> 26:59.099
Kitty didn't know either.

26:59.100 --> 27:00.981
No, Kitty didn't know either.

27:00.982 --> 27:04.766
Well, you both have very
different cultural references.

27:04.767 --> 27:08.159
Mom, he's not in high school.
Not according to the bloggers.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.280
All right. You know what,
Kevin? Fine.

27:09.281 --> 27:11.149
You've been waiting all night.
Let the jokes begin.

27:11.150 --> 27:13.942
Seth, I swear,
she invited me tonight.

27:14.055 --> 27:15.039
Kevin. What?

27:15.040 --> 27:16.679
You know, this has
been a lovely dinner.

27:17.092 --> 27:20.275
But it's getting late, so...
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

27:20.276 --> 27:24.028
You can't leave. I made a pie. Pie.

27:24.029 --> 27:24.779
Great.

27:25.718 --> 27:29.192
Right. Well, I should probably
stay for some pie, then.

27:29.717 --> 27:31.617
All right, ready for transport.

27:35.084 --> 27:36.676
Michael, honey.

27:36.677 --> 27:38.644
What's... what's happening? Look,
everything's gonna be okay.

27:38.645 --> 27:40.073
We just have to get your
husband to the hospital.

27:40.074 --> 27:42.497
Leah, the firemen will take you.
You'll be right behind us, okay?

27:42.498 --> 27:43.470
I want to come with him. Okay,

27:43.471 --> 27:45.017
leah, listen to me.
Michael's gonna be fine,

27:45.018 --> 27:47.171
but I need to work on him,
so I can't have you in the truck.

27:48.068 --> 27:50.505
He's gonna be fine? You promise?

27:51.242 --> 27:52.106
I promise.

28:03.577 --> 28:04.563
Okay, write this down.

28:04.564 --> 28:07.014
His, uh, respiration
rate is 65 and shallow,

28:07.015 --> 28:08.374
B.P. is 60 over palp,

28:08.375 --> 28:11.150
and his heart rate is tachy at 150.
How far out are we?

28:11.151 --> 28:12.214
Three minutes away.

28:13.265 --> 28:16.151
O-2 and fluids aren't helping.
He's pale and diaphoretic.

28:16.152 --> 28:17.626
Justin, you promised that woman.
Are you sure?

28:17.627 --> 28:19.326
I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure.

28:21.100 --> 28:22.632
His lung is collapsed.
We can fix it.

28:22.633 --> 28:23.255
How do you know?

28:23.256 --> 28:25.106
I just know. I've done
this a hundred times.

28:26.907 --> 28:28.333
We're losing him.

28:29.432 --> 28:31.599
Okay, all right, I just
need to reinflate his lung.

28:31.600 --> 28:34.280
Here? Yep, here,
so cut his shirt open.

28:45.594 --> 28:47.554
Okay, how you doing? Almost there.

28:47.555 --> 28:49.042
Almost there? Okay.

28:49.917 --> 28:51.479
Got it. Okay.

28:51.885 --> 28:53.051
All right, I'm just
gonna stick the needle

28:53.052 --> 28:55.953
between these two ribs,
right... right here.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.468
His lung is reinflated.

29:13.786 --> 29:16.386
He's gonna be okay.
Yeah, he's gonna be okay.

29:21.395 --> 29:23.107
So would anyone like some more pie?

29:23.108 --> 29:23.726
Mnh-mnh. Oh, mnh-mnh.

29:23.727 --> 29:25.308
No, thanks. I'd love some.

29:25.620 --> 29:27.352
Well, good. You know,
we could put some in tupperware

29:27.353 --> 29:28.422
and you could take
it home if you want.

29:28.423 --> 29:30.497
You know, Kevin, just because
you always have to diet

29:30.498 --> 29:32.010
doesn't mean that you
should make fun of people

29:32.011 --> 29:36.074
who have a higher metabolism
than you do. Children.

29:36.499 --> 29:37.498
Children?

29:38.246 --> 29:41.796
Karl, do you have any children? No.

29:44.908 --> 29:46.521
So, Seth...

29:47.043 --> 29:48.067
How is school?

29:48.772 --> 29:52.101
Oh, no, no, no. No, no,
he's not just in school, mom.

29:52.102 --> 29:54.519
He... he's a writer.
Mm-hmm.

29:54.719 --> 29:56.485
Yeah, I'm working on a novel,
uh, right now.

29:56.486 --> 29:58.358
And he's also working
on some short stories.

29:58.359 --> 29:59.707
Mm-hmm. Oh, have you
been published, Seth?

29:59.708 --> 30:01.606
No, I... Well, no, no,
he hasn't been published.

30:01.607 --> 30:04.013
I mean, let's talk about it.
How hard is it to get published

30:04.014 --> 30:06.763
in this day and age? Well,
you did it, Karl did it, so...

30:06.764 --> 30:09.923
Well, yes, Karl, but he's...
he's older and more established.

30:09.924 --> 30:12.022
You know, you don't have
to make excuses for me.

30:12.023 --> 30:13.455
I'm not making excuses for you.

30:13.456 --> 30:14.768
You've been answering questions
for me all night long.

30:14.769 --> 30:16.228
A-are you afraid that I'm

30:16.229 --> 30:17.939
gonna embarrass you or...
Well, not until now.

30:17.940 --> 30:21.722
Have you ever even read the
short story that I gave you

30:21.723 --> 30:22.972
weeks ago, huh?

30:24.247 --> 30:27.559
No. That's what I thought.
Unbelievable.

30:27.863 --> 30:28.843
Well, as I said before,

30:28.844 --> 30:30.257
I think it's time for me to go.

30:30.258 --> 30:32.593
No, no, no, Karl, sit down.
Sit down. Sit down.

30:32.594 --> 30:35.462
We have talked enough about
other people's problems.

30:35.463 --> 30:36.971
Let's... let's talk about your book.

30:36.972 --> 30:39.757
I know sometimes you have to
shout to be heard around here.

30:39.758 --> 30:42.477
Well, you know, the problem is,
is I don't want to shout.

30:42.568 --> 30:44.617
Frankly, this entire
meal feels like

30:44.618 --> 30:47.065
a group therapy session to me,
and usually those come

30:47.066 --> 30:48.510
in 50-minute increments.

30:48.511 --> 30:51.360
You said you wanted to
get to know my children.

30:51.361 --> 30:54.611
You said you were a control freak...
Oh, for God sake, Nora.

30:55.036 --> 30:56.877
I told you that in confidence,

30:56.878 --> 30:59.819
not so you could broadcast it
to an entire room full of...

30:59.820 --> 31:03.064
A room of... of what, strangers?

31:03.564 --> 31:06.688
Karl, these are not strangers.

31:06.976 --> 31:09.288
I'm feeling very
uncomfortable right now,

31:09.289 --> 31:11.838
so... good night.

31:19.135 --> 31:20.498
Let's go. Let's get him out here.

31:20.499 --> 31:23.509
Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

31:24.501 --> 31:25.724
His vitals normalized

31:25.725 --> 31:28.174
after we did a needle
decompression in transit.

31:34.145 --> 31:34.694
Wow.

31:34.695 --> 31:35.470
Wow.

31:36.382 --> 31:38.438
Well, that was definitely

31:38.674 --> 31:40.862
more serious than the cheese lady.

31:41.336 --> 31:42.199
Yeah.

31:43.636 --> 31:45.668
You know, you're really
amazing at this, Justin.

31:45.669 --> 31:46.525
I mean it.

31:47.524 --> 31:49.941
Look, Annie, I know it's
a lot with me in the rig

31:49.942 --> 31:50.897
and all the time...

31:50.898 --> 31:53.082
No, no, it's... it's fine. Seriously.

31:53.083 --> 31:55.423
This is who you are,
and I'm okay with that.

31:55.711 --> 31:58.785
As long as we don't have to go
out on another call tonight.

31:58.786 --> 32:01.184
Oh, no way. Thank God.

32:01.185 --> 32:02.433
Are you...
What, do you think I'm crazy?

32:02.434 --> 32:04.553
I've been out since
6:30 in the morning.

32:06.166 --> 32:08.201
Well, I mean, I could come over

32:08.202 --> 32:10.600
and maybe make you some dinner.

32:11.504 --> 32:12.926
You deserve to have someone

32:12.927 --> 32:14.716
take care of you for
a while, Justin.

32:17.008 --> 32:18.621
That sounds really great.

32:26.791 --> 32:28.955
They're all so cute.
Why are they so cute?

32:28.956 --> 32:32.464
Kevin, you said if you came,
you would just try to be...

32:32.465 --> 32:33.596
I-I know. Okay, okay.

32:33.597 --> 32:36.265
But it's just...
I don't know where to begin.

32:36.266 --> 32:38.746
Well, we'll just be ourselves.

32:38.747 --> 32:41.868
Remember what Jill said.
See who we connect with.

32:41.869 --> 32:44.029
Connect with? What,
is this speed dating?

32:44.030 --> 32:45.827
I'm sorry, Scotty.
I don't think I can do this. Kev...

32:45.828 --> 32:49.509
Hey, are you guys here for the fair?
Yeah.

32:49.510 --> 32:53.377
Cool. I'm Olivia. And I can
show you around if you want.

32:53.378 --> 32:56.067
Oh, that would... that'd be great.

32:56.068 --> 32:59.592
Um, I'm Scotty,
and this is my husband Kevin.

33:00.179 --> 33:02.291
No way. You guys are gay?

33:02.991 --> 33:03.766
Kidding.

33:03.991 --> 33:06.607
So here's the deal...
a couple of the younger kids,

33:06.608 --> 33:08.816
they're really shy when
it comes to these events.

33:08.991 --> 33:11.609
So, like, I was thinking,
maybe it would be okay

33:11.610 --> 33:13.054
if I introduce you to them.

33:14.179 --> 33:15.228
That'd be great.

33:16.154 --> 33:17.728
Yeah. That would be great.

33:17.729 --> 33:19.092
Nice. Come on.

33:20.060 --> 33:21.372
Oh. Oh, wow.

33:39.623 --> 33:41.049
Oh, Judy.

33:41.050 --> 33:42.277
Look, keep your chin up.

33:42.278 --> 33:44.719
Let me know how it turns out, okay?

33:44.956 --> 33:47.334
Uh, we have time for
one more caller.

33:47.335 --> 33:51.631
I'm going to take
"Antiques Lover from Los Angeles."

33:52.381 --> 33:53.219
Good morning.

33:53.702 --> 33:55.726
Is that the only name
you're gonna give us?

33:55.750 --> 33:57.742
Yeah, I'd like to, uh,
remain anonymous

33:57.743 --> 33:58.687
if you don't mind.

33:59.512 --> 34:01.337
Oh. Okay.

34:01.338 --> 34:02.726
All right. Fine.

34:03.537 --> 34:04.887
Fine, so, uh...

34:05.812 --> 34:07.851
What would you like to talk about,
chandeliers?

34:07.852 --> 34:10.623
Um, did you find some
pottery at a garage sale?

34:10.652 --> 34:13.339
No, actually,
I'd... I'd like some advice.

34:13.752 --> 34:17.094
I made a, uh, terrible
fool of myself last night

34:17.094 --> 34:19.275
at my girlfriend's house.

34:19.501 --> 34:22.190
I-I embarrassed myself

34:22.192 --> 34:24.777
in front of her entire family.

34:25.413 --> 34:26.525
Oh, well, I'm...

34:29.351 --> 34:34.116
I'm... I'm... I'm sure it
wasn't that bad. Was it?

34:34.117 --> 34:37.324
Oh, yeah. Yeah. It definitely...
It was a bit of a tantrum.

34:37.603 --> 34:40.514
And, uh, anyway, my question is...

34:40.514 --> 34:42.415
How do I make it up to her?

34:44.675 --> 34:46.725
I don't... I don't think
the real question is,

34:46.726 --> 34:47.887
how do you make it up to her?

34:47.888 --> 34:49.312
I think the question is,

34:50.074 --> 34:52.070
why were you so uncomfortable
in the first place?

34:52.071 --> 34:55.556
I mean, what caused the tantrum,
as you put it?

34:55.856 --> 34:57.768
Well, let's just say that, um, uh,

34:58.181 --> 35:00.337
the dinner conversation last night

35:00.338 --> 35:03.242
was a little too personal
for my taste. That's all.

35:03.243 --> 35:05.662
Too personal? How is it too pers...

35:05.962 --> 35:07.848
You could just give
us some examples

35:07.849 --> 35:10.012
for the listeners to understand.

35:10.179 --> 35:13.795
Well, for starters, her family
feels that it's appropriate

35:13.796 --> 35:16.572
to share every last detail of
their lives with each other,

35:16.573 --> 35:19.484
with no regard for their
guests' sensibilities

35:19.485 --> 35:20.861
and boundaries.

35:20.862 --> 35:22.666
Really? Mm-hmm.

35:23.054 --> 35:25.332
Well, don't you think,
as the guest,

35:25.333 --> 35:28.562
maybe it was up to you to
adjust to their dynamic

35:28.563 --> 35:30.257
rather than the other way around?

35:30.658 --> 35:31.482
Uh...

35:32.370 --> 35:34.157
What if I can't?

35:35.720 --> 35:36.519
Oh.

35:37.494 --> 35:38.219
Oh.

35:40.707 --> 35:43.888
Listen, um, antiques lover,

35:43.889 --> 35:45.072
I-I hate to say this,

35:45.073 --> 35:47.848
but it sounds to me like
you and your girlfriend

35:47.849 --> 35:48.780
are just...

35:50.526 --> 35:51.788
Not a good match.

35:55.029 --> 35:56.839
Oh, that's a little drastic.
Don't you think?

35:56.840 --> 35:59.978
Look, sometimes,
two perfectly good people

36:01.028 --> 36:02.498
just don't fit together.

36:02.499 --> 36:03.921
You mean change...

36:04.933 --> 36:07.321
Especially antiques.

36:08.370 --> 36:09.145
So...

36:10.170 --> 36:12.233
You think we should just break up?

36:15.670 --> 36:16.432
Yes.

36:18.442 --> 36:20.355
I'm sorry, yes.

36:21.153 --> 36:22.015
Yeah.

36:23.404 --> 36:24.715
I'm sorry, too.

36:29.844 --> 36:31.861
So we're gonna take a short break.

36:31.862 --> 36:33.719
Um, stick with us, okay?

36:55.499 --> 36:58.037
You do realize it's 11:30, right?

36:58.416 --> 37:00.972
You do realize I do have days off?

37:00.973 --> 37:03.248
I'm just checking.
Why, is there a problem?

37:03.249 --> 37:03.915
You got somewhere to be,
somewhere you want to go?

37:03.916 --> 37:05.788
No, it's my day off, too.

37:06.649 --> 37:08.073
So what do you want to do?

37:09.323 --> 37:10.776
You don't mind if we do something

37:10.777 --> 37:12.723
that doesn't involve
an emergency, do you?

37:12.724 --> 37:15.696
No. Oh, bowling.
We should go bowling.

37:15.697 --> 37:17.164
I don't know about bowling.

37:17.165 --> 37:19.120
Hmm. You know what?

37:19.121 --> 37:20.981
I don't... I don't want you to think

37:20.982 --> 37:23.761
that I need something
from you, okay?

37:23.762 --> 37:25.677
I mean, I've got a busy schedule...
No, okay, Annie...

37:25.678 --> 37:26.539
And I-I've got things.

37:26.540 --> 37:28.898
Annie, Annie, look...

37:31.157 --> 37:33.406
I'm really glad you
were there last night.

37:34.382 --> 37:35.206
Me, too.

37:35.229 --> 37:36.341
No, I mean, I'm...

37:37.003 --> 37:39.441
I'm glad you were there
to see me do my job...

37:40.091 --> 37:42.590
Which can only mean one thing.

37:43.190 --> 37:44.003
What's that?

37:45.228 --> 37:46.911
I really care about you, Annie.

37:48.119 --> 37:49.431
Justin, you don't...

37:50.034 --> 37:51.278
You don't have to
just say that if you...

37:51.279 --> 37:53.960
No one's twisting my arm.
Will you just listen?

37:55.122 --> 37:55.897
Yes.

37:59.052 --> 38:00.413
I've been trying to move forward

38:00.414 --> 38:01.489
for a long time.

38:01.613 --> 38:04.237
And I-I feel like I don't
have time for anything,

38:04.238 --> 38:08.112
but... after last night,

38:08.113 --> 38:09.614
I think that I...

38:10.213 --> 38:11.626
Need to reconsider that.

38:12.902 --> 38:15.755
Well, I know there's only so
many hours in a day, Justin.

38:15.756 --> 38:17.739
Yeah, but it's how you arrange 'em.

38:18.414 --> 38:19.768
And it's what you do with 'em.

38:21.014 --> 38:24.037
And I'm not some... 9-to-5 guy,

38:24.038 --> 38:24.827
but...

38:26.401 --> 38:29.138
I really want to make this
relationship work, Annie.

38:36.090 --> 38:38.940
You've never called it
a relationship before.

38:39.577 --> 38:42.590
Yeah. Well... I just did.

38:54.608 --> 38:57.063
What? You... you laughed.
What's so funny?

38:57.064 --> 38:58.385
Would you... Seth.

38:58.386 --> 39:00.844
Stop it. Stop it.
I'm... I'm almost finished.

39:00.845 --> 39:02.748
Ah. You said you
were a fast reader.

39:02.749 --> 39:04.208
Ju... No, no, shush.

39:09.707 --> 39:12.343
Okay. I'm finished.

39:12.344 --> 39:14.047
Okay, good. Can we...
can we go to lunch now?

39:14.048 --> 39:16.010
Would you just sit down, please?

39:16.374 --> 39:18.162
God. Okay, okay.

39:18.474 --> 39:20.973
All right. Hit me.

39:20.974 --> 39:23.060
Okay. Okay.

39:23.061 --> 39:26.977
So, um, what exactly is
this story really about?

39:26.978 --> 39:29.396
Um... well, you know,

39:29.397 --> 39:31.102
it's... it's, um,
it's about a painter.

39:31.103 --> 39:33.403
Mm-hmm. It's kind of a
retrospective of her life's work.

39:33.404 --> 39:36.634
She's accomplished,
she's powerful... you know?

39:36.635 --> 39:38.562
Right. She's...
she's all these things

39:38.563 --> 39:40.721
that seem very impressive,

39:40.722 --> 39:43.875
but then she goes to
this little crappy diner,

39:43.876 --> 39:46.830
and she's... she's all alone
and she's still in her gown,

39:46.831 --> 39:49.609
and... and she has this very
meaningful conversation

39:49.610 --> 39:52.013
with a waitress,

39:52.014 --> 39:52.862
right?

39:55.686 --> 39:57.148
Uh... uh-huh.

39:57.149 --> 39:59.143
And the reason that we love her

39:59.144 --> 40:01.298
is not because of all
her accomplishments.

40:01.299 --> 40:03.856
It's because of her... her...

40:04.769 --> 40:06.193
Vulnerability.

40:06.906 --> 40:07.831
Is that right?

40:08.931 --> 40:11.718
Uh, what are you...
What are you saying?

40:13.018 --> 40:17.041
Well... I-I was just wondering

40:17.042 --> 40:18.536
if by any chance

40:18.537 --> 40:21.605
I was the painter.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.514
Well, yeah. I mean, I don't...

40:25.515 --> 40:28.576
Maybe... maybe you were,
um, an inspiration.

40:28.577 --> 40:31.163
She's 70. Well, she's...

40:31.164 --> 40:33.739
She's a... she's a painter.
She's a character.

40:33.740 --> 40:34.873
She's an old character.

40:34.874 --> 40:36.711
Well, she's... in a story...

40:36.712 --> 40:37.923
She's old.

40:43.385 --> 40:45.447
Kitty, people are, uh,
people are looking.

40:45.448 --> 40:46.547
I don't care.

40:49.110 --> 40:49.659
You don't?

40:49.660 --> 40:50.535
Mnh-mnh.

40:57.459 --> 40:59.258
I love your story.

41:00.158 --> 41:02.931
Well, if there's somebody that
you made a connection with,

41:02.932 --> 41:05.271
you can fill out the
child's name on this list.

41:05.596 --> 41:06.745
It's a preferential.

41:06.746 --> 41:08.969
You rank the kids in order

41:08.970 --> 41:10.221
of the top five that
you're interested in,

41:10.222 --> 41:11.399
and we have them do the same,

41:11.400 --> 41:14.484
and if there's a match,
then we'll take it from there.

41:15.459 --> 41:17.441
Wow. It's... it's like
a fraternity rush.

41:17.442 --> 41:19.833
Take your time. Thank you.

41:19.834 --> 41:20.671
Thanks.

41:27.347 --> 41:28.358
So this is it?

41:28.652 --> 41:30.842
I don't know how we're
supposed to choose.

41:31.715 --> 41:32.864
Are you guys leaving?

41:33.914 --> 41:35.901
Yeah. Cool.

41:35.902 --> 41:38.069
I just wanted to say, it was
really nice to meet you guys.

41:38.070 --> 41:40.291
Oh, thank you. That's so sweet.

41:52.027 --> 41:53.466
Okay. Bye.

41:53.703 --> 41:54.415
Bye.

41:54.593 --> 41:55.431
Bye.

42:00.380 --> 42:02.180
I think she just chose us.
