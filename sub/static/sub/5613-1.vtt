01:39.240 --> 01:40.321
War.

01:41.160 --> 01:44.403
It's been a part of humanity
in every age.

01:45.200 --> 01:47.009
We fight for power,

01:47.400 --> 01:48.811
for riches,

01:48.920 --> 01:51.287
for rights or for freedom.

01:52.720 --> 01:56.566
There always seems to be
something to fight for.

01:57.400 --> 02:01.485
But one thing has remained
true of every war.

02:02.280 --> 02:07.810
Behind the field of battle,
someone has developed a strategy.

02:10.199 --> 02:13.807
This was part of my husband's role
in the army.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.880
He would look at what
the enemy was doing,

02:17.240 --> 02:19.720
then begin putting together
the resources

02:20.040 --> 02:22.611
and a plan to fight against them.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.211
He was a crucial part of this process

02:26.520 --> 02:29.000
until a heart attack claimed his life.

02:32.080 --> 02:36.404
That was a hard time for me and our son.

02:39.520 --> 02:43.605
I was reminded that death
is a part of life,

02:44.240 --> 02:48.245
and that the life we're given
should never be taken for granted.

02:52.400 --> 02:55.244
It's been 40 years since Leo passed,

02:55.920 --> 03:00.767
but I still hold on to the many lessons
I learned from that time.

03:02.800 --> 03:08.807
I find myself amazed that
of the many battles we engage in today,

03:09.360 --> 03:13.126
be it money, control or matters
of the heart,

03:14.440 --> 03:17.603
very few of us
know how to fight the right way,

03:18.440 --> 03:22.001
or understand
who we're really fighting against.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.609
To win any battle,

03:24.960 --> 03:29.090
you've got to have
the right strategy and resources,

03:29.720 --> 03:33.884
because victories
don't come by accident.

03:54.480 --> 03:56.300
Hey, Mom, I gotta go. Yeah.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.686
All right, okay. Bye.

03:58.160 --> 04:01.130
Jason and David, get rid of the ball
and help me with these boxes!

04:05.000 --> 04:08.220
I am so sorry.
You must be Elizabeth Jordan.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.220
- I am. And you're Melissa?
- Yes.

04:10.320 --> 04:12.846
I'm sorry. We just started packing.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.740
No problem. Can I help you with that?

04:14.840 --> 04:17.100
Honey. Honey, I gotta be
in Knoxville at 2:00.

04:17.200 --> 04:20.363
But I finished the closet.
That was in the refrigerator.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.128
- Real estate agent.
- Software rep.

04:24.240 --> 04:25.260
How did you know that?

04:25.360 --> 04:27.169
It's on that folder
you're holding in your hand.

04:28.480 --> 04:30.020
I would love to stay.
I'm very sorry I have to leave.

04:30.120 --> 04:32.140
My wife can answer everything
about the house.

04:32.240 --> 04:35.660
We realize it's a disaster
and we've agreed to blame it on the kids.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.762
- So, I'll call you later.
- Love you!

04:38.480 --> 04:41.882
I understand. My husband does
the same thing. Pharmaceuticals.

04:43.720 --> 04:45.449
Does he ever get tired of the travel?

04:45.920 --> 04:46.921
No, I do not.

04:47.240 --> 04:48.300
I enjoy the drive.

04:48.400 --> 04:50.300
Well, we're excited to do business
with you, Tony.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.940
- Hey, tell Coleman I said hello.
- I'll do it.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.740
And thanks for the new driver.

04:54.840 --> 04:55.980
Hey, you enjoy it, okay?

04:56.080 --> 04:57.180
- I will.
- All right.

04:57.280 --> 04:58.420
Good to see you.

04:58.520 --> 05:00.727
Gentlemen, we'll be in touch.

05:05.440 --> 05:06.771
I see you made the sale.

05:08.280 --> 05:10.123
- Of course.
- I'm impressed.

05:10.640 --> 05:13.211
Most guys run out
with their tail between their legs.

05:13.720 --> 05:14.801
I'm Tony Jordan.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.806
Veronica Drake. I work for Mr. Barnes.

05:18.680 --> 05:20.045
I'll be your contact for the purchase.

05:21.080 --> 05:23.100
Okay. Well, Veronica Drake,

05:23.200 --> 05:25.567
I guess I'll be seeing you again
when I return in two weeks.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.524
I look forward to it.

05:34.920 --> 05:35.980
Mom?

05:36.080 --> 05:37.491
I'm in here, Danielle.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.082
Here's my last report card.

05:41.520 --> 05:43.170
I still got one C.

05:47.040 --> 05:49.540
Baby. You have an A in everything else.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.820
One C in math is not that bad.

05:51.920 --> 05:54.161
At least you get a break
for the summer, right?

05:56.000 --> 05:57.620
Is that your feet?

05:57.720 --> 05:59.722
I'm sorry, baby,
I ran out of foot powder.

06:00.280 --> 06:01.540
That smells terrible!

06:01.640 --> 06:05.611
I know, Danielle. I just needed
to take my shoes off for a minute.

06:06.560 --> 06:08.801
That's, like, awful.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.565
Well, don't just sit there
looking at them.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.762
Why don't you give me a hand
and rub them right there?

06:13.600 --> 06:14.761
No way.

06:15.640 --> 06:17.980
Girl, go set the table for dinner.

06:18.080 --> 06:20.540
When your daddy gets home,
you can show him your report card. Okay?

06:20.640 --> 06:21.971
- Yes, ma'am.
- All right.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.122
I just heard him pull in, Danielle.

06:29.240 --> 06:31.083
Will he be mad about my C?

06:31.320 --> 06:34.449
I already told you, baby,
a C is not that bad. It's okay.

06:37.720 --> 06:38.700
Hey, Daddy.

06:38.800 --> 06:39.926
Hey, Danielle.

06:40.600 --> 06:44.500
I got my last report card.
I made all A's except for one C.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.100
So, I just got a notification
that you moved $5,000

06:47.200 --> 06:49.601
from our savings
into your checking account.

06:49.720 --> 06:52.100
That better not be
so you can prop up your sister again.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.646
You just gave that much money
to your family last month.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.820
And my sister needs it
more than your parents do.

06:56.920 --> 06:58.410
My parents are elderly. Okay?

06:58.520 --> 06:59.620
Your sister married a bum,

06:59.720 --> 07:01.580
and I'm not supporting someone
who's too lazy to work.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.580
Darren is not a bum.

07:03.680 --> 07:07.162
- He's just having a hard time finding a job.
- Liz, he is a bum.

07:07.520 --> 07:10.251
Look, I can't even remember
the last time he had a job.

07:12.280 --> 07:13.406
Can we talk about this later?

07:13.640 --> 07:14.971
No, we'll talk about it now.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.961
Because if you want to give them
what you make, that's fine.

07:18.080 --> 07:20.700
- But you're not giving them my money.
- Your money?

07:20.800 --> 07:23.500
The last time I checked,
we both put money into that account.

07:23.600 --> 07:27.180
And the last time I checked,
I make four times what you do.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.965
So you don't move a cent out
of that account without asking me first.

07:32.560 --> 07:34.369
Can we please just eat dinner?

07:37.880 --> 07:39.405
You know what? Go ahead.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.525
I'm going to the gym.

08:17.640 --> 08:19.210
Ballgame!

08:19.800 --> 08:21.928
That was sick, man! That was sick.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.928
- You all right, dog?
- Yeah. Why?

08:29.760 --> 08:31.580
You look like you're playing
a little mad tonight.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.489
So? You know that means I play better.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.210
Better means ball hog?

08:36.280 --> 08:39.489
Dude, I can't get a pass from you.
It'd be easier to baptize a cat.

08:40.039 --> 08:42.020
I just needed to blow off
a little steam. Okay?

08:42.120 --> 08:44.121
- Well, I hope you're done.
- I gotta go.

08:44.360 --> 08:47.364
- Yo, yo, yo, you're coming to church, right?
- Maybe.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.086
Maybe means no.

08:50.440 --> 08:51.980
Hey, Tony, man. You gotta hit me one.

08:52.080 --> 08:54.811
- Come on, man. I gotta go.
- Dude, I just told all these guys. Just one.

08:56.440 --> 08:57.646
Watch this.

09:00.320 --> 09:01.401
Told you!

09:01.720 --> 09:05.645
The favor of God can't be bought,
traded or manipulated.

09:05.880 --> 09:07.609
Because people still come to church

09:07.800 --> 09:10.540
with their hearts
totally distant from the Lord.

09:10.640 --> 09:12.860
But they think they could put on
their Sunday best,

09:12.960 --> 09:16.487
and throw a super spiritual smile
on their face and impress God.

09:16.960 --> 09:22.364
God is looking for people
who will seek him with a whole heart.

09:22.680 --> 09:26.540
So it all comes down to this.
We either seek Him or we don't.

09:26.640 --> 09:30.565
And God surely knows the difference
between the two, and so should we.

09:32.480 --> 09:33.740
Danielle, I have to meet a client
in the morning,

09:33.840 --> 09:36.220
so I'm going to drop you off early
at the community center, okay?

09:36.320 --> 09:38.891
Okay. Can we pick up Jennifer
on the way?

09:40.000 --> 09:41.380
Sure, if it's okay with her mother.

09:41.480 --> 09:42.811
Who's Jennifer?

09:43.080 --> 09:44.764
She's on my Double Dutch team.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.326
I thought you were playing basketball.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.500
I wanted to jump rope again.

09:48.600 --> 09:51.060
Tony, you should go see her practice
tomorrow. She's really very good.

09:51.160 --> 09:52.810
I'm out of town this week.

09:55.640 --> 09:56.926
When were you gonna tell me?

09:57.960 --> 09:59.246
I just did.

10:04.360 --> 10:05.820
Tony, I know you're
the company's top salesman,

10:05.920 --> 10:09.049
but in order for this family to function,
we have to communicate.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.100
I thought you'd be here this week.

10:11.200 --> 10:13.780
Well, if you want to continue to live
in this house, I have to make sales.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.769
And that means being flexible.

10:22.720 --> 10:24.131
Aren't you a little too old
to be jumping rope?

10:31.520 --> 10:32.681
Here you go.

10:34.160 --> 10:38.802
Now there's 5, 10, 15, 20.

10:39.400 --> 10:42.290
And here's 5 extra
'cause I like your haircut.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.500
Thank you, Ms. Williams.

10:43.600 --> 10:47.060
I'm tired of seeing all these young boys
with sloppy hair

10:47.160 --> 10:48.844
and pants around their knees.

10:48.960 --> 10:52.140
- A man wears his pants around his waist.
- Yes, ma'am.

10:52.240 --> 10:56.300
Well, tell your mama I said hello.
And I'll see you next week.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.562
- Yes, ma'am. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10:59.240 --> 11:00.401
Ms. Williams?

11:00.800 --> 11:01.801
That's me.

11:02.240 --> 11:03.780
You must be Elizabeth.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.740
Well, it's so good to meet you.

11:05.840 --> 11:07.444
You can call me Clara.

11:07.560 --> 11:10.131
Well, come on in.
Let me show you the house.

11:10.720 --> 11:13.540
I got to put my coffee pot on.
Can I get you something?

11:13.640 --> 11:15.642
No, thank you. I had mine at home.

11:16.680 --> 11:18.444
This is a beautiful house.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.405
I think so, too.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.763
Built in 1905.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.327
And I've lived here almost 50 years.

11:26.400 --> 11:29.449
Leo added that sun porch on the back
all by himself.

11:30.680 --> 11:32.330
This must be Leo.

11:35.200 --> 11:36.247
That's Leo.

11:37.040 --> 11:40.283
We were married
for 14 years before he died.

11:40.880 --> 11:44.327
He had just been promoted to captain
before that picture was taken.

11:44.760 --> 11:47.366
He was so handsome in that uniform.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.130
He's fine, ain't he?

11:50.760 --> 11:53.540
Yes, we wanted five or six children,

11:53.640 --> 11:58.043
but the Lord only gave us Clyde,
'cause he was all I could handle.

11:58.440 --> 12:01.060
You see that big crack
over there on the wall?

12:01.160 --> 12:02.660
That was Clyde.

12:02.760 --> 12:06.446
Now, this is my third favorite place.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.171
It's my sitting room.

12:09.280 --> 12:11.886
- What do you do in here?
- Mainly sit.

12:13.160 --> 12:17.210
Well, come on in here.
Let me show you the dining room.

12:19.320 --> 12:22.961
Now this is my second favorite place.

12:24.040 --> 12:25.724
I love this room.

12:26.280 --> 12:27.645
This is beautiful.

12:28.120 --> 12:30.168
And I love this fireplace.

12:30.600 --> 12:33.126
I've got a lot of good memories in here.

12:33.440 --> 12:34.680
Yes, I do.

12:35.680 --> 12:37.091
Lot of laughter.

12:38.600 --> 12:40.489
And a few tears, too.

12:42.520 --> 12:45.842
Now this is why I'm moving in with Clyde
a few blocks away.

12:46.840 --> 12:49.684
It's getting harder
to negotiate these stairs.

12:50.800 --> 12:54.020
Okay, so three bedrooms
and two full baths.

12:54.120 --> 12:56.930
- Do you mind if I take some pictures?
- Go ahead, that's fine.

12:57.560 --> 13:00.211
You got one of those smart phones.

13:00.520 --> 13:03.060
I've been meaning
to get me one of those.

13:03.160 --> 13:06.100
Can't do nothing with my phone
but call folks.

13:06.200 --> 13:07.725
Must be a dumb phone.

13:10.680 --> 13:12.444
- You got it?
- I do.

13:12.560 --> 13:15.780
They say if you live in a house
with stairs, you'll live longer.

13:15.880 --> 13:18.087
So I should make it to 180.

13:19.720 --> 13:21.404
This is fascinating, Ms. Clara.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.562
That's my Wall of Remembrance.

13:25.120 --> 13:28.442
And when things aren't going so well,
I look back on it,

13:28.920 --> 13:32.766
and I'm reminded that God
is still in control.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.045
It encourages me.

13:35.880 --> 13:38.042
I sure could use some of that.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.220
I'm sorry.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.220
Okay. So, I've got
a few questions about utilities,

13:43.320 --> 13:45.140
and then we should probably talk
about the asking price.

13:45.240 --> 13:46.287
All right.

13:46.920 --> 13:49.300
Okay. So, I think I got everything
that I need for now.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.925
So nice to meet you, Ms. Clara.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.340
Listen, if you're available tomorrow,

13:52.440 --> 13:55.140
I'd like to come by and show you
some comparisons in the area.

13:55.240 --> 13:58.260
Well, why don't you come by for coffee
tomorrow morning

13:58.360 --> 14:00.727
and we'll talk about it then? Say 10:00?

14:02.760 --> 14:05.411
Okay. Yeah, I can do that.
I'll see you at 10:00.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.921
By the way,
what's your most favorite room?

14:10.680 --> 14:12.523
I'll tell you tomorrow.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.129
Then I look forward to tomorrow.

14:23.840 --> 14:24.841
How you doing?

14:25.600 --> 14:26.580
- Mr. Jordan?
- Yes.

14:26.680 --> 14:27.900
- Samples closet?
- Yes, please.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.809
- Right this way.
- All right.

14:31.720 --> 14:34.020
You can just use the third shelf down
and just leave the door open,

14:34.120 --> 14:36.566
- and I'll come back and get it later.
- All right. Thank you.

14:52.560 --> 14:54.220
You must be Mr. Jordan.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.700
Dr. Morris, yes. I'm Tony Jordan,
Brightwell Pharmaceuticals.

14:56.800 --> 14:57.881
We met last March.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.260
- I remember. How are you?
- I'm doing fine.

15:00.360 --> 15:03.420
I saw your write-up on new stimulants
and you showed interest in Predizim.

15:03.520 --> 15:05.420
So I just left you a case
in your samples closet.

15:05.520 --> 15:07.180
That's fantastic. I appreciate that.

15:07.280 --> 15:11.171
It's no problem. You'll easily find them.
It's the third shelf, blue caps.

15:11.520 --> 15:14.330
Now what I need you to do though,
is just sign this receipt.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.700
And it just shows
that I left them with you.

15:16.800 --> 15:19.060
Now, Dr. Morris, if you need any more,
you just let me know

15:19.160 --> 15:20.540
and I'll be glad to bring some over.

15:20.640 --> 15:22.060
Thank you, Tony. We'll try them out.

15:22.160 --> 15:24.660
- All right. Sounds good. We'll see you again.
- Right.

15:24.760 --> 15:26.205
And I'll be looking forward
to that next article.

15:26.320 --> 15:27.651
Thank you.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.561
And he thinks it's my sister's fault.
Can you even believe that?

15:33.280 --> 15:36.170
Well, if my man said that to me,
I'd be angry, too.

15:36.480 --> 15:38.100
We don't fight that much anymore.

15:38.200 --> 15:41.140
After 31 years of stalemates, girl,
it just is not worth it.

15:41.240 --> 15:42.620
I wouldn't put up with it.

15:42.720 --> 15:45.246
His money became your money
the minute he said, "I do."

15:46.000 --> 15:47.684
So I'd give it to my sister anyway.

15:48.040 --> 15:49.530
I don't even like my sister.

15:50.520 --> 15:51.700
Just be careful, Elizabeth.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.723
You do not want World War III
to break out in your home.

15:54.200 --> 15:55.725
No. No, I don't.

15:56.600 --> 15:59.365
But there are days, Mandy.
There are days.

16:00.680 --> 16:02.900
It's hard to submit to a man like that.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.525
You know what my mama used to say to me?

16:05.280 --> 16:07.540
She used to say that sometimes
submission is learning to duck

16:07.640 --> 16:08.880
so God can hit your husband.

16:11.080 --> 16:12.241
It's tough being a woman.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.041
You got that right.

16:32.160 --> 16:35.084
Veronica, this is Tony Jordan.

16:35.760 --> 16:38.331
We met a few days ago
after I met with Mr. Barnes.

16:38.920 --> 16:40.740
Hey, listen, I'll be coming
through town next week

16:40.840 --> 16:44.049
and I was wondering if you could
recommend a couple of nice restaurants.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.888
Feel free to call me back
at this number.

16:47.480 --> 16:48.641
Take care.

16:55.760 --> 16:58.047
I appreciate you coming this morning.

16:58.480 --> 17:02.020
- Coffee will be ready in a couple of minutes.
- Sounds good.

17:02.120 --> 17:04.060
I ran a sales report from the area.

17:04.160 --> 17:07.130
I wrote down a suggested asking price
for the house.

17:10.280 --> 17:11.930
Well, what do you think?

17:15.760 --> 17:18.161
Now, what did you say
your husband did for a living?

17:19.520 --> 17:20.780
Well, we actually
haven't talked about that,

17:20.880 --> 17:23.963
but he's a sales rep
for Brightwell Pharmaceuticals.

17:25.760 --> 17:28.650
And where did you say
you attended church?

17:29.680 --> 17:32.604
Well, we occasionally attend
Riverdale Community.

17:34.240 --> 17:35.890
So you would say you know the Lord.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.323
Yes! I would say I know the Lord.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.765
You think the Lord is okay
with this asking price?

17:45.240 --> 17:46.969
And you have children?

17:47.640 --> 17:51.340
Ms. Clara, my husband, Tony, and I
have been married for 16 years.

17:51.440 --> 17:54.740
We have one daughter.
Her name is Danielle and she's 10.

17:54.840 --> 17:58.162
She enjoys pop music and ice cream
and jumping rope.

17:59.480 --> 18:01.528
Well, that's good to know.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.729
Now, you say
you attend church occasionally.

18:06.280 --> 18:09.580
Is that because your pastor
only preaches occasionally?

18:09.680 --> 18:13.420
Ms. Clara, I really would like
to help you sell your house.

18:13.520 --> 18:14.900
That's why I'm here.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.740
As far as my faith is concerned,
I believe in God, just like most people.

18:18.840 --> 18:21.047
He's very important to me.

18:21.160 --> 18:24.243
Well, let me get our coffee.

18:27.120 --> 18:30.681
So, if I asked you
what your prayer life was like,

18:31.800 --> 18:33.609
would you say that it was hot or cold?

18:35.600 --> 18:37.602
I don't know that I would say it's hot.

18:37.720 --> 18:42.009
I mean, we're like most people.
We have full schedules. We work.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.780
But I would consider myself
a spiritual person.

18:45.880 --> 18:49.700
I'm not hot, but I'm not cold either.
Just, you know, somewhere in the middle.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.211
Here you go.

18:52.680 --> 18:56.207
- I've got cream or sugar if you need it.
- No, thank you. I like it black.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.406
Ms. Clara, you like your coffee
room temperature?

19:05.840 --> 19:07.649
No, baby, mine's hot.

19:11.240 --> 19:12.287
Elizabeth,

19:12.880 --> 19:16.248
people drink their coffee hot or cold,

19:16.680 --> 19:20.207
but nobody likes it lukewarm,
not even the Lord.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.380
Point taken, Ms. Clara.

19:22.480 --> 19:24.980
But why do you feel the need
to examine my personal life?

19:25.080 --> 19:27.765
Because I've been where you are.

19:28.280 --> 19:31.762
And you don't have to step
on the same land mines that I did.

19:32.240 --> 19:33.810
That's a waste of time.

19:34.480 --> 19:37.484
And this asking price is just fine.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.286
Let me get you a hot cup of coffee.

19:43.680 --> 19:46.126
I was a little sneaky last time.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.322
What land mines do you think
I might step on?

19:57.960 --> 19:59.325
You tell me.

20:01.520 --> 20:06.128
Now, if there was one thing in your life
that you could make better,

20:06.880 --> 20:08.166
what would it be?

20:08.480 --> 20:09.811
Just one?

20:10.960 --> 20:13.180
Well, I'd probably have
to say my marriage.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.965
If there's one thing
we do well, it's fight.

20:16.440 --> 20:18.124
No, I don't think you do.

20:18.560 --> 20:19.891
I'm sorry?

20:20.480 --> 20:24.644
Just because you argue a lot
doesn't mean that you fight well.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.641
Every couple has some friction
every now and then.

20:29.160 --> 20:32.780
But I bet that you never
feel like you've won

20:32.880 --> 20:35.451
after you've had an argument
with your husband.

20:39.320 --> 20:42.051
Can I ask you how much
you pray for your husband?

20:46.320 --> 20:47.446
Well, very little.

20:48.600 --> 20:50.011
Elizabeth,

20:50.840 --> 20:55.528
I think it's time for me to show you
my favorite place in this house.

21:06.320 --> 21:08.846
Now, this is where I do my fighting.

21:10.240 --> 21:11.366
A closet?

21:11.600 --> 21:13.762
I call it my war room.

21:30.760 --> 21:31.886
So...

21:32.600 --> 21:34.728
So, you wrote prayers
for each area of your life?

21:35.000 --> 21:37.241
A prayer strategy. Yes.

21:37.760 --> 21:40.620
Now, I used to do
what you and your husband are doing,

21:40.720 --> 21:42.700
but it got me nowhere.

21:42.800 --> 21:46.900
And then I really started studying
what the scriptures say.

21:47.000 --> 21:51.642
And God showed me that it wasn't my job
to do the heavy lifting. No.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.924
That was something
that only He could do.

21:55.320 --> 22:00.326
It was my job to seek Him, to trust Him
and to stand on His word.

22:02.120 --> 22:04.820
Ms. Clara, I've never seen
anything like this.

22:04.920 --> 22:07.571
And I admire it, I really do. I just...

22:08.200 --> 22:10.340
I don't have time to pray
that much every day.

22:10.440 --> 22:14.411
But you apparently have time
to fight losing battles with your husband.

22:16.240 --> 22:17.446
Elizabeth,

22:17.960 --> 22:21.760
if you will give me one hour a week,

22:22.240 --> 22:27.406
I can teach you how to fight
the right way with the right weapons.

22:31.360 --> 22:34.580
Since you're good with the asking price,
I'll go ahead and list the house.

22:34.680 --> 22:38.127
I'd like to think about
our other discussion.

22:39.360 --> 22:43.524
Elizabeth, please forgive me
for being so direct,

22:43.920 --> 22:46.890
but I see in you a warrior

22:47.160 --> 22:49.128
that needs to be awakened.

22:50.440 --> 22:53.940
But I will respect
whatever decision you make.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.441
Thank you, Ms. Clara.
I hope you have a good day.

22:56.560 --> 22:57.641
You, too.

23:03.120 --> 23:05.900
Don't let me push too hard, Lord.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.480
I know I got a big mouth.

23:29.640 --> 23:31.900
If they do that stunt
in the competition, they'll win.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.860
Why don't you ask your dad
about helping us get uniforms?

23:34.960 --> 23:36.962
He's not here.
It's not like he would care anyway.

23:37.160 --> 23:39.766
Can you ask your mom?
My mom already gave part of the money.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.923
Come on, we can go to my room.

23:48.680 --> 23:52.526
So, I told my dad that he could jump with us,
and he totally started laughing.

23:52.920 --> 23:55.300
He said he would only do it
if Mom did it with him,

23:55.400 --> 23:57.580
which, of course, she would never do.

23:57.680 --> 24:01.420
So, they, like, start talking
about doing the worst routine ever.

24:01.520 --> 24:02.851
Like, in a funny way.

24:02.960 --> 24:05.940
And she starts laughing so hard,
her face turned bright red.

24:06.040 --> 24:08.725
Then she starts squeaking
'cause she couldn't breathe.

24:08.840 --> 24:10.524
It was hilarious.

24:10.840 --> 24:12.604
I wish I lived at your house.

24:12.720 --> 24:15.724
Whenever my parents are together,
they just fight.

24:22.360 --> 24:24.010
Jennifer, how's your family?

24:24.680 --> 24:25.727
Fine.

24:26.880 --> 24:29.360
Would you like to stay for dinner?
You're welcome to eat with us.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.047
Okay.

24:32.120 --> 24:34.009
Okay, well, I'm gonna go change.

24:35.080 --> 24:37.048
I'll call you girls down
in a few minutes.

25:28.320 --> 25:29.446
Danielle...

25:34.440 --> 25:36.442
You know we love you, right?

25:38.960 --> 25:40.803
That wasn't very convincing.

25:42.280 --> 25:46.285
Well, I think you love me a little bit.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.120
A little bit?

25:49.040 --> 25:50.804
Danielle, you're my daughter.

25:51.320 --> 25:53.420
You're the most important thing
in the whole world to me.

25:53.520 --> 25:54.931
You gotta believe that.

25:56.800 --> 25:58.325
What's my team name?

26:01.760 --> 26:03.171
The Firecrackers.

26:03.800 --> 26:05.290
That was last year.

26:07.640 --> 26:09.165
What are our colors?

26:15.160 --> 26:17.925
What jump rope tricks
did I just learn to do?

26:22.200 --> 26:23.770
Who's my new coach?

26:29.280 --> 26:31.567
What award did I win
last week on my team?

26:34.680 --> 26:36.682
You won an award last week?

26:41.800 --> 26:43.689
Danielle, I'm so sorry.

26:44.920 --> 26:46.570
I'm so sorry.

26:50.760 --> 26:52.364
I'm so sorry.

26:56.360 --> 26:57.441
I'm sorry.

27:10.200 --> 27:11.929
Well, good morning.

27:12.320 --> 27:15.060
Her heart is just breaking
and I was completely unaware.

27:15.160 --> 27:17.891
Tony, he's completely unaware.

27:18.280 --> 27:20.020
That man is running
out of time, Ms. Clara.

27:20.120 --> 27:22.700
He's off in his own world
being top salesman somewhere

27:22.800 --> 27:25.620
while his daughter is growing
more and more calloused to him every day.

27:25.720 --> 27:28.740
He shows no interest
in anybody but himself.

27:28.840 --> 27:30.700
And another thing.
I don't have proof of this,

27:30.800 --> 27:33.980
but if he's not getting it from me,
he's got to be getting it from somebody.

27:34.080 --> 27:36.820
He makes all these little flirtatious
comments to other women...

27:36.920 --> 27:39.526
Elizabeth, just so I know,

27:40.080 --> 27:43.562
how much of the one hour
we got together today

27:43.680 --> 27:46.331
are you gonna spend
whining about your husband?

27:46.760 --> 27:49.940
And how much we gonna spend
on what the Lord can do about it?

27:50.040 --> 27:54.284
I'm sorry, Ms. Clara. I just get so wound up
the more I think about it.

27:54.720 --> 28:00.060
Your thoughts about your husband
are almost entirely negative, aren't they?

28:00.160 --> 28:01.924
He acts like an enemy to me.

28:02.440 --> 28:05.330
See, you're fighting the wrong enemy.

28:05.760 --> 28:09.731
Now, your husband certainly has
his issues, but he's not your enemy.

28:10.720 --> 28:13.200
When I fought against my husband,

28:13.640 --> 28:17.611
I was fighting against my own marriage
and my family.

28:17.960 --> 28:22.363
Now, I tried for years to fix Leo,
but I couldn't do it.

28:22.600 --> 28:24.523
Well, I haven't got anywhere with Tony.

28:24.800 --> 28:26.928
'Cause it's not your job.

28:27.400 --> 28:31.530
Who said that it was your responsibility
to fix Tony?

28:32.040 --> 28:36.648
It's your job to love him, to respect him
and to pray for the man.

28:36.960 --> 28:38.962
God knows he needs it.

28:39.440 --> 28:43.240
And men don't like it when
their woman's always trying to fix them.

28:44.120 --> 28:45.326
Elizabeth,

28:46.320 --> 28:51.167
you got to plead with God
so that He can do what only He can do.

28:51.640 --> 28:55.167
And then you got to get out of the way
and let Him do it!

28:57.680 --> 28:59.489
I don't even know where to start.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.126
Here.

29:01.480 --> 29:05.451
You will find some
of my favorite scriptures in here.

29:05.960 --> 29:09.203
They were my battle plan
to pray for my family.

29:09.760 --> 29:11.205
You can start with that.

30:14.080 --> 30:15.127
Mom?

30:15.400 --> 30:16.686
I'm in here, Danielle.

30:29.400 --> 30:31.209
Mom, are you okay?

30:32.040 --> 30:33.804
Yes. What do you need?

30:35.040 --> 30:37.930
Why are you eating chips in the closet?

30:39.080 --> 30:41.447
I'm just having some private time. Okay?

30:42.880 --> 30:43.927
Okay.

30:45.320 --> 30:47.620
Jennifer wanted to know
if I could spend the night.

30:47.720 --> 30:50.963
I already did my chores,
and it's okay with her parents.

30:51.600 --> 30:54.340
Okay, but I want you home
by lunch tomorrow. Okay?

30:54.440 --> 30:57.125
- Yes, ma'am.
- And, Danielle,

31:00.120 --> 31:02.521
don't tell anybody
I was eating chips in this closet.

31:03.360 --> 31:06.682
Don't tell anyone my mom
was eating chips in the closet, okay?

31:06.800 --> 31:09.485
- Who are you talking to?
- Jennifer.

31:11.200 --> 31:12.440
Jennifer?

31:15.320 --> 31:16.446
Yes, ma'am?

31:19.120 --> 31:22.124
I'm asking you not to tell anybody
I was eating chips in my closet.

31:23.160 --> 31:25.731
- Okay.
- Thank you.

31:28.120 --> 31:29.804
What's that smell?

31:30.840 --> 31:32.660
That would be my shoes, Jennifer.

31:32.760 --> 31:36.321
And if you girls would kindly shut the door,
you won't have to smell it anymore.

31:44.720 --> 31:46.900
Is she not allowed to eat chips?

31:47.000 --> 31:50.163
I can have all the chips I want!
This is my house!

31:54.160 --> 31:55.321
Great.

32:03.600 --> 32:05.250
Hello, Tony. How are you?

32:05.360 --> 32:06.900
- Julia, how're you doing?
- I'm doing well, thanks.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.300
- Having a good day?
- I am, thank you.

32:09.400 --> 32:12.540
Coleman's expecting you
and Tom's in there, too.

32:12.640 --> 32:15.420
- Thanks for the heads up.
- You're welcome. Right this way.

32:15.520 --> 32:16.726
All right, thank you.

32:21.520 --> 32:24.580
- Tony! How's my favorite rep?
- Real good. How're you doing?

32:24.680 --> 32:26.540
- Heard we got the Holcombe account.
- Yes, we did.

32:26.640 --> 32:29.780
- That's fantastic. You did it again.
- Appreciate that. Thank you.

32:29.880 --> 32:32.420
Even Tom was impressed,
and you know that's hard to do.

32:32.520 --> 32:34.060
- Good work.
- Thank you.

32:34.160 --> 32:37.420
Look, I know you're on your way home,
but we just wanted to say thanks.

32:37.520 --> 32:39.488
And you got a nice bonus check
coming your way.

32:39.600 --> 32:41.140
- I like that.
- Yeah, you do.

32:41.240 --> 32:42.860
- How's Elizabeth?
- She's good.

32:42.960 --> 32:44.180
- Tell her I said hello.
- I'll do it.

32:44.280 --> 32:45.850
- Good to see you.
- All right.

32:54.680 --> 32:57.100
Cynthia, it's not gonna do you any good
to fight about it.

32:57.200 --> 32:59.300
You can't get the job for him.

32:59.400 --> 33:01.020
Well, is he trying at all?

33:01.120 --> 33:04.044
Is he sending out resumes
or making calls, anything?

33:05.920 --> 33:07.081
I know.

33:08.200 --> 33:12.888
Well, I'm sorry, but he's making it hard,
not just on you but everybody around you.

33:14.400 --> 33:17.722
No, I'm not saying that we're not gonna help.
We're still talking about it. Okay?

33:19.720 --> 33:21.961
Listen, Tony just got home.
I need to call you later.

33:22.840 --> 33:25.969
Yeah. I love you, too. Bye.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.889
- How was your trip?
- It was good.

33:31.760 --> 33:34.081
- I take it that was your sister.
- Yep.

33:34.920 --> 33:36.729
Darren getting a job?

33:37.480 --> 33:38.561
Not yet.

33:38.960 --> 33:40.660
Not yet as in he's trying?

33:40.760 --> 33:43.620
Or not yet as in he's still sitting
on the couch playing video games?

33:43.720 --> 33:45.768
Tony, what he does
is not Cynthia's fault.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.860
Listen, she just needs one month's rent
and a car payment.

33:48.960 --> 33:50.460
I think we should at least do that.

33:50.560 --> 33:52.220
Cynthia married a loser. Okay?

33:52.320 --> 33:54.260
That was her choice
when everybody told her not to.

33:54.360 --> 33:57.330
- It is her fault.
- Tony, she cannot control him.

33:57.800 --> 33:59.802
She's got a job, but it's not enough.

34:00.440 --> 34:02.700
Listen, I'm not asking
for $5,000 anymore.

34:02.800 --> 34:05.460
I'm asking for one month's rent
and a car payment.

34:05.560 --> 34:08.100
And the next month you'll be asking
for the same thing, Liz.

34:08.199 --> 34:09.804
So the answer is still no.

34:10.520 --> 34:12.362
And what is that smell in here?

34:14.280 --> 34:15.929
I'm putting powder in my shoes.

34:16.679 --> 34:19.411
- Well, can't you do that outside?
- Yes.

34:22.760 --> 34:26.161
Tony, if you won't do it for her,

34:27.159 --> 34:28.241
do it for me.

34:32.840 --> 34:33.887
No.

35:10.200 --> 35:12.885
- You got another bonus?
- Yes, sir.

35:14.040 --> 35:16.202
Dude, I went in the wrong line of work.

35:17.680 --> 35:20.968
Well, I couldn't have been a paramedic.

35:21.560 --> 35:25.690
- You got that right, bro.
- And you too calm to be a salesman.

35:26.160 --> 35:29.540
Yeah. Yeah, but could you imagine

35:29.640 --> 35:32.405
if I got bonuses
every time I saved somebody's life?

35:33.600 --> 35:36.460
Check it out. Heimlich, $200.

35:36.560 --> 35:39.740
Right? CPR, $400.

35:39.840 --> 35:40.887
Right.

35:41.560 --> 35:44.006
Like $1,000, if they're ugly.

35:44.320 --> 35:47.620
Dude, you remember that one lady who had
swallowed that garlic and she choked,

35:47.720 --> 35:49.700
and I had to give her mouth-to-mouth?

35:49.800 --> 35:52.326
- Yeah.
- That should've been a Hawaiian vacation.

35:52.720 --> 35:55.260
- I couldn't have done it.
- Yeah. You could do it.

35:55.360 --> 35:58.887
You're not gonna let somebody die
in front of you while you eat your salad.

36:00.200 --> 36:04.000
I don't do CPR, Mike.
I'd have just called 911.

36:04.360 --> 36:07.409
That's just cold.
You just gonna let somebody die?

36:07.760 --> 36:09.524
What if it was your wife?

36:13.200 --> 36:15.885
Hold on, brother. What? What's that?

36:17.320 --> 36:19.084
- What is that?
- What's what?

36:19.360 --> 36:21.089
Dude, what's up with you and Liz?

36:21.920 --> 36:23.001
Nothing.

36:23.440 --> 36:24.940
Nothing?
Look at you getting all uptight.

36:25.040 --> 36:27.441
You got extra veins popping out
that wasn't even there before.

36:28.440 --> 36:31.842
Mike, I'm just tired of her. Okay?
All right? I said it.

36:32.760 --> 36:35.047
- I'm just tired of her junk.
- Her junk?

36:35.760 --> 36:38.500
Dude, you married her, junk and all.

36:38.600 --> 36:41.860
It's not some sort of buffet where you
get to pick and choose what you want.

36:41.960 --> 36:43.450
You get all of her, bro.

36:44.760 --> 36:47.411
And you better not have somebody
on the side.

36:48.080 --> 36:50.686
So, you're trying to do CPR
on my personal life now?

36:51.760 --> 36:54.740
Okay. Yeah, I'm a paramedic.
But I'm also a Christian,

36:54.840 --> 36:58.049
which means I help people
while I'm helping people.

36:59.720 --> 37:02.020
Mike, look, we've been friends
for a long time,

37:02.120 --> 37:04.460
but some things
are just none of your business.

37:04.560 --> 37:06.900
True, and since we've been friends
a long time,

37:07.000 --> 37:09.260
I'm not just gonna
watch your marriage die.

37:09.360 --> 37:12.648
So if it's bleeding,
I'm not gonna keep eating my salad.

37:22.840 --> 37:24.251
I'll see you in church.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.082
I'd like to see the church in you, bro.

37:36.560 --> 37:38.767
Hey, somebody need to come move this.

37:41.840 --> 37:44.889
This was a treat for me, Elizabeth.

37:45.200 --> 37:50.286
I enjoy coming here.
And your daughter is precious.

37:51.120 --> 37:52.167
She is.

37:53.840 --> 37:56.650
You know, there are days
I wish she had a brother or sister.

37:57.160 --> 37:59.481
We were just too busy
chasing our careers.

38:00.600 --> 38:02.940
I don't know that that was
a wise thing to do.

38:03.040 --> 38:05.042
You don't enjoy your job?

38:05.160 --> 38:08.926
There are days I do. Sold a house
this morning, so that was good.

38:11.040 --> 38:13.407
I'd just rather have a good marriage
than more money.

38:13.520 --> 38:15.940
Mom! Can we go get ice cream?

38:16.040 --> 38:17.963
They sell it right over there.

38:19.120 --> 38:20.884
Ms. Clara, would you like
some ice cream?

38:21.560 --> 38:23.085
I'll tell you what.

38:24.080 --> 38:27.980
If you go get the ice cream
and let your mother walk me to the car,

38:28.080 --> 38:30.860
- I'll pay for it.
- Oh, no, no, no. I'm paying for it.

38:30.960 --> 38:35.260
And rob me of a blessing?
I'm paying, we're all eating.

38:35.360 --> 38:39.206
And I'll take two scoops
of Butter Pecan, please. In a cup.

38:39.920 --> 38:42.020
I'll have one scoop
of Cookies and Cream, okay?

38:42.120 --> 38:43.140
And listen, just stay right there,

38:43.240 --> 38:45.580
'cause we're gonna pull the car around
and pick you up at the entrance.

38:45.680 --> 38:49.287
Okay. Can I have strawberry sherbet with
gummy worms and chocolate syrup on top?

38:51.480 --> 38:53.660
So, what does a normal week
in your life look like?

38:53.760 --> 38:57.140
Well, my son drops in for an hour or two
during the week.

38:57.240 --> 39:00.289
I go grocery shopping,
an occasional doctor's visit,

39:00.400 --> 39:05.020
and my girlfriends and I get together
on Friday afternoons for coffee.

39:05.120 --> 39:09.380
Other than that, I read a lot
and I spend time with Jesus.

39:09.480 --> 39:11.926
I used to spend so much time
with my girlfriends before my job...

39:12.760 --> 39:14.700
Give me your money right now.

39:14.800 --> 39:16.380
Did you hear me?
Both of you, give it to me now.

39:16.480 --> 39:18.260
Okay. Okay, we will.
Just please, put the knife down.

39:18.360 --> 39:19.646
Do it, and do it now!

39:20.640 --> 39:21.660
No.

39:21.760 --> 39:27.051
Now you put that knife down right now
in the name of Jesus.

39:35.280 --> 39:37.169
And you believe he was early 20s?

39:37.400 --> 39:39.129
Yeah. Maybe 25.

39:40.160 --> 39:41.730
So, let me get this straight.

39:42.280 --> 39:44.500
He was pointing a knife at you

39:44.600 --> 39:48.207
and you told him to put it down
in Jesus' name?

39:48.320 --> 39:52.220
Right. Now when you write that down,
don't leave out Jesus.

39:52.320 --> 39:54.780
People always leaving Jesus out.

39:54.880 --> 39:57.531
That's one of the reasons
we're in the mess we in.

40:00.880 --> 40:02.420
Yes, ma'am.

40:02.520 --> 40:05.540
You know, what concerns me
is that you could've easily been killed.

40:05.640 --> 40:09.940
Well, I know a lot of people probably
would've given him their money.

40:10.040 --> 40:13.010
I understand that,
but that's their decision.

40:16.320 --> 40:19.020
Are you not eating
your ice cream, Elizabeth?

40:19.120 --> 40:20.580
No. I'm not hungry anymore.

40:20.680 --> 40:25.527
Well, let me help you with that.
No reason to waste perfectly good ice cream.

40:33.400 --> 40:35.129
Now that's good!

40:40.280 --> 40:43.250
I'm sorry, I just thought
I should call Tony.

40:43.680 --> 40:44.900
I understand.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.580
You'd think he'd be more alarmed.

40:46.680 --> 40:48.380
He just kept saying
that since we were all okay,

40:48.480 --> 40:49.580
I should just calm down.

40:49.680 --> 40:52.260
I'm having trouble calming down myself.

40:52.360 --> 40:54.140
Really? You seemed calm earlier.

40:54.240 --> 40:57.740
Yeah, but I got a huge sugar-rush
from all that ice cream.

40:57.840 --> 41:01.686
I feel like I can run around
the block a few times.

41:03.320 --> 41:07.460
While we on the subject of Tony,
I have something for you to do.

41:07.560 --> 41:08.580
What's that?

41:08.680 --> 41:13.447
I want you to write down everything
that you can think of that he's done wrong.

41:14.240 --> 41:16.940
Ms. Clara, if I did that,
I'd be writing a long time.

41:17.040 --> 41:19.180
Well, then just write
down the highlights.

41:19.280 --> 41:21.886
And I'll be back to check on you
in a little while.

41:37.080 --> 41:39.020
Well, that's almost three pages.

41:39.120 --> 41:41.980
And I could write more, but you'll get
the gist of it when you read it.

41:42.080 --> 41:44.287
Actually, I'm not gonna read it.

41:45.640 --> 41:48.120
My question to you is this.

41:48.800 --> 41:53.931
In light of all these wrongs,
does God still love Tony?

41:56.400 --> 41:57.925
We both know he does.

41:58.160 --> 41:59.400
Do you?

42:00.760 --> 42:02.762
Now, Ms. Clara, you're meddling.

42:05.360 --> 42:10.207
There's love in my heart for Tony,
but it's just buried under a lot of frustration.

42:10.360 --> 42:13.170
- So he needs grace.
- Grace?

42:13.520 --> 42:15.260
I don't know that he deserves grace.

42:15.360 --> 42:17.124
Do you deserve grace?

42:18.240 --> 42:22.300
Ms. Clara, you have a habit of backing me up
in a corner and making me squirm.

42:22.400 --> 42:24.164
I felt the same way.

42:25.040 --> 42:29.204
But the question still remains.
Do you deserve grace?

42:30.440 --> 42:34.809
The Bible says that no one is righteous,
not even one.

42:35.160 --> 42:40.610
For we have all sinned.
So, really, none of us deserve grace.

42:41.320 --> 42:44.688
But we all still want God's forgiveness.

42:45.320 --> 42:48.608
Elizabeth, it comes down to this.

42:49.520 --> 42:52.540
Jesus shed his blood on the cross.

42:52.640 --> 42:57.820
He died for you.
Even when you did not deserve it.

42:57.920 --> 43:02.060
And He rose from the grave
and offers forgiveness and salvation

43:02.160 --> 43:05.323
for anyone who turns to Him.

43:06.360 --> 43:08.408
But the Bible also says

43:08.520 --> 43:13.162
that we can't ask Him to forgive us
while refusing to forgive others.

43:13.840 --> 43:16.900
I know, Ms. Clara.
But that's just so hard to do.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.580
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

43:19.680 --> 43:22.206
But that's where grace comes in!

43:22.520 --> 43:24.682
He gives us grace!

43:25.240 --> 43:29.564
And He helps us to give it to others,
even when they don't deserve it.

43:30.200 --> 43:33.140
We all deserve judgment.

43:33.240 --> 43:40.044
And that is what a holy God gives us
when we don't repent and believe in His Son.

43:41.720 --> 43:47.568
I had to forgive Leo for some things,
and it wasn't easy.

43:47.880 --> 43:49.370
But it freed me.

43:49.800 --> 43:55.980
Elizabeth, there's not room for you
and God on the throne of your heart.

43:56.080 --> 43:59.766
It's either Him or it's you.
You need to step down.

44:00.360 --> 44:05.366
Now, if you want victory,
you're gonna have to first surrender.

44:05.840 --> 44:07.171
But, Ms. Clara,

44:07.560 --> 44:12.620
do I just back off and choose to forgive
and then just let him walk all over me?

44:12.720 --> 44:17.886
God is a good defense attorney.
Trust it to Him.

44:18.400 --> 44:22.020
And then you can turn your focus
to the real enemy.

44:22.120 --> 44:23.500
The real enemy?

44:23.600 --> 44:25.820
The one that wants to remain hidden.

44:25.920 --> 44:28.060
The one that wants to distract you

44:28.160 --> 44:33.371
and deceive you and divide you
from the Lord and your husband!

44:33.480 --> 44:35.448
You see, that's how he works.

44:36.280 --> 44:40.980
Satan comes to steal, kill and destroy.

44:41.080 --> 44:43.660
And he is stealing your joy.

44:43.760 --> 44:48.846
He is killing your faith
and he's trying to destroy your family.

44:49.720 --> 44:54.123
If I were you,
I would get my heart right with God.

44:54.600 --> 44:58.685
And you need to do
your fighting in prayer!

44:59.040 --> 45:04.888
And you need to kick the real enemy
out of your home with the word of God.

45:05.840 --> 45:08.286
It's time for you to fight, Elizabeth.

45:08.920 --> 45:11.620
It's time for you to fight
for your marriage!

45:11.720 --> 45:14.500
It's time for you to fight
the real enemy!

45:14.600 --> 45:18.525
It's time for you
to take off the gloves and do it!

45:39.000 --> 45:42.060
There's no magic
in the location you pray.

45:42.160 --> 45:47.530
But scripture does say to go
into your inner room and pray in secret.

45:47.640 --> 45:53.204
And your heavenly Father, who sees
what's done in secret, will reward you.

45:53.840 --> 45:59.370
Now get rid of any distractions
and focus your heart and mind on Him.

45:59.960 --> 46:04.170
Acknowledge that He is God,
and that you desperately need Him.

46:04.880 --> 46:11.240
Now, be grateful for your blessings,
but lift your needs and requests to Him.

46:11.840 --> 46:15.180
If you've got something to confess,
then confess it.

46:15.280 --> 46:18.860
Ask Him for forgiveness.
Then choose to believe Him

46:18.960 --> 46:22.420
when He says that He loves you
and will take care of you.

46:22.520 --> 46:25.780
Then pray for the heart of your husband,

46:25.880 --> 46:30.283
your daughter and anyone else
that the Lord brings to your mind.

46:30.840 --> 46:32.444
And don't rush it.

46:32.560 --> 46:37.043
You take your time, and then you listen.

47:44.080 --> 47:45.411
God...

47:48.280 --> 47:50.089
God, I need you.

47:54.360 --> 47:56.727
I know I haven't prayed like I should.

47:59.960 --> 48:03.851
I know that I haven't...
I haven't followed you like I should.

48:05.280 --> 48:07.521
But I need you, right now.

48:12.640 --> 48:14.961
Lord, I've been so angry at Tony,

48:15.800 --> 48:19.327
and I'm still so angry at him.

48:23.480 --> 48:25.687
But I don't want to lose my marriage.

48:31.360 --> 48:33.089
Lord, forgive me.

48:35.160 --> 48:36.286
Forgive me.

48:37.360 --> 48:39.522
I'm not his judge, you are.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.446
But I'm asking you, please,

48:45.680 --> 48:48.445
please don't let him do this.

48:57.920 --> 48:59.046
Take over.

49:01.320 --> 49:02.970
Please, take over.

49:06.360 --> 49:11.048
Take my heart and take all this anger.

49:13.880 --> 49:15.769
Help him love me again.

49:19.680 --> 49:21.409
And help me love him.

49:26.240 --> 49:30.689
If he's doing something wrong,
don't let him get away with it.

49:33.400 --> 49:35.607
Stand in his way.

49:36.600 --> 49:38.648
I'm asking you, please,

49:40.440 --> 49:41.885
to help me.

50:00.960 --> 50:04.567
"The thief comes only to steal

50:05.320 --> 50:07.527
"to kill and destroy.

50:09.360 --> 50:13.445
"But I've come that you may have a life,
and have it abundantly."

50:16.800 --> 50:18.529
"But the Lord is faithful.

50:21.320 --> 50:24.563
"He will strengthen
and protect you from the evil one.

50:29.240 --> 50:31.208
"Submit to God.

50:32.800 --> 50:34.609
"Resist the devil,

50:36.960 --> 50:38.883
"and he will flee."

50:44.000 --> 50:45.525
"Submit to God.

50:50.120 --> 50:54.444
"Resist the devil, and he will flee."

50:57.840 --> 50:59.490
"Submit to God.

51:02.920 --> 51:04.490
"Resist the devil,

51:07.480 --> 51:09.323
"and he will flee."

51:41.920 --> 51:44.241
I don't know where you are, Devil,

51:45.160 --> 51:47.242
but I know you can hear me.

51:49.680 --> 51:52.331
You have played with my mind

51:53.400 --> 51:55.482
and had your way long enough.

51:58.520 --> 52:00.170
No more.

52:01.600 --> 52:03.284
You are done!

52:12.360 --> 52:15.204
Jesus is the Lord of this house.

52:17.040 --> 52:19.964
And that means there's no place
for you here anymore.

52:21.560 --> 52:27.920
So take your lies, your schemes
and your accusations,

52:28.040 --> 52:31.886
and get out in Jesus' name!

52:41.480 --> 52:43.500
You can't have my marriage.

52:43.600 --> 52:45.660
You can't have my daughter.

52:45.760 --> 52:48.140
And you sure can't have my man.

52:48.240 --> 52:53.201
This house is under new management
and that means you are out!

53:04.040 --> 53:05.500
And another thing.

53:05.600 --> 53:10.300
I am so sick of you stealing my joy,
but that's changing, too.

53:10.400 --> 53:12.660
My joy doesn't come from my friends.

53:12.760 --> 53:14.842
It doesn't come from my job.

53:14.960 --> 53:17.340
It doesn't even come from my husband.

53:17.440 --> 53:19.920
My joy is found in Jesus.

53:20.600 --> 53:24.286
And just in case you forgot,
he has already defeated you.

53:25.200 --> 53:30.366
So go back to Hell where you belong
and leave my family alone.

53:48.400 --> 53:50.482
You know what I'd really like right now?

53:50.720 --> 53:51.801
Tell me.

53:52.480 --> 53:54.608
A glass of my favorite wine.

53:55.160 --> 53:57.766
Okay, we can do that. What is it?

53:58.760 --> 54:00.330
It's not here.

54:01.040 --> 54:02.485
It's at my apartment.

54:04.160 --> 54:07.243
Well, if it's your favorite,
I'd like to try it.

54:08.200 --> 54:11.300
Here you are, sir.
Hope you both have a wonderful evening.

54:11.400 --> 54:13.687
Thank you. We will.

54:25.480 --> 54:26.527
Veronica, listen.

54:27.800 --> 54:31.361
I need a minute. All right?
I'll be right back.

54:32.680 --> 54:33.841
Okay.

54:52.200 --> 54:53.361
Mom?

55:18.000 --> 55:19.140
Danielle?

55:19.240 --> 55:21.368
What happened to your closet?

55:35.280 --> 55:38.250
I'm doing something
I should've done a long time ago.

55:39.800 --> 55:41.689
I'm learning how to pray

55:43.200 --> 55:44.486
and fight

55:45.440 --> 55:46.646
and trust.

55:47.720 --> 55:49.660
By cleaning out your closet?

55:49.760 --> 55:52.180
No. Well, yes. But no.

55:52.280 --> 55:55.409
I mean, it needed to be cleaned out.

55:56.160 --> 55:58.606
But that's not why I did it. I did it...

55:59.800 --> 56:01.370
I did it to fight in prayer.

56:01.840 --> 56:03.660
You're fighting God?

56:03.760 --> 56:05.340
No, I'm not...

56:05.440 --> 56:08.140
Well, sometimes I do fight God.

56:08.240 --> 56:11.483
But I shouldn't 'cause He always wins.

56:12.800 --> 56:16.180
So, you know, I'm praying
for God to fight for me

56:16.280 --> 56:18.123
'cause I am just sick of losing.

56:19.120 --> 56:21.420
But not against God.
I need to lose against God.

56:21.520 --> 56:24.980
I'm sick of losing in other areas
where I'm just fighting

56:25.080 --> 56:27.686
but I just keep losing all the time.

56:28.840 --> 56:30.001
It's exhausting.

56:31.200 --> 56:34.700
So I'm learning how not to fight God

56:34.800 --> 56:37.963
and how to let Him fight for me
so that we can all win.

56:38.480 --> 56:39.811
Does that make any sense?

56:40.200 --> 56:41.486
No.

56:43.800 --> 56:46.849
You know what?
I don't make much sense when I'm tired.

56:47.320 --> 56:49.004
You must be really tired.

56:50.560 --> 56:53.220
Let's just go get a late night snack.
Okay? And I'll try it again.

56:53.320 --> 56:54.651
Okay.

57:40.440 --> 57:43.364
Now see, you're already influencing
your daughter.

57:43.480 --> 57:45.900
This can change everything for her.

57:46.000 --> 57:50.460
I admit, when I first started praying in there,
10 minutes seemed like an eternity.

57:50.560 --> 57:52.847
Now I have a hard time
even wanting to leave.

58:29.200 --> 58:30.281
Hello.

58:32.600 --> 58:34.762
I just need you to sign
for this package.

58:37.400 --> 58:38.845
Thank you so much.

58:39.680 --> 58:42.740
This is a present for my daughter.
I can't wait to give it to her.

58:42.840 --> 58:45.650
Well, I hope it takes your breath away.

58:49.160 --> 58:50.764
Have a nice day, ma'am.

58:59.120 --> 59:02.300
- I like it. And you got one, too?
- Yep, I sure did.

59:02.400 --> 59:05.220
And you can write your prayer requests
in there, your favorite verses.

59:05.320 --> 59:08.369
- We can journal, anything we want.
- Hey, Daddy.

59:08.480 --> 59:09.620
- Hey, Danielle.
- Hey.

59:09.720 --> 59:11.700
I didn't think you were coming home
till tonight.

59:11.800 --> 59:15.043
Yeah. I finished up everything
pretty early, so...

59:16.800 --> 59:18.723
- You got enough for me?
- Sure.

59:18.880 --> 59:21.087
Jennifer's mom is coming
to pick Danielle up in a few minutes,

59:21.200 --> 59:23.441
- but you and I can eat.
- All right.

59:24.240 --> 59:26.481
- I'll take my stuff to the room.
- All right.

59:39.480 --> 59:42.220
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

59:42.320 --> 59:43.820
You and the girls hanging out today?

59:43.920 --> 59:45.740
Yeah. We're gonna go to the park
for a couple hours,

59:45.840 --> 59:49.606
and then I thought we could grab
a milkshake at Chick-fil-A's, if that's okay?

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:13.940
So, what's been going on here?

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.060
Well, I sold another house on Tuesday.

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:18.208
And I already told you
about getting held up, so...

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:20.169
Yeah, look, about that.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:23.443
It's not that I didn't care.

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:27.020
I just got really busy,

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:28.660
so when I saw
that you were all right...

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:32.287
I understand. It's all right.
I'm sorry for getting so worked up about it.

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:33.580
You're sorry?

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:37.100
Yeah. I knew you were at work,
probably in a meeting.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:39.780
I should've just waited
till later to bring it up.

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:42.780
My mind was just racing,
so I took it out on you.

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.740
But you know what?
I really think it was good for Danielle.

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:49.811
I think it helped her to realize how important
it is to be aware of who's around you, so...

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:52.251
You want hot sauce?

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:56.090
- Yeah, that's fine.
- You want mild or Wrath of God?

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.687
I don't want Wrath of God.
Let me have the other one.

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.730
What do you want, Liz?

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.446
- You mean, right now?
- Yeah.

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:24.330
Well, I would kill for

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:26.930
a hot fudge sundae.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.886
Just

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:31.926
fudge everywhere.

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:35.240
And two scoops of ice cream,
Cookies and Cream.

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:40.726
Whipped cream. Just mounds,
mounds of whipped cream on top.

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:45.328
And one cherry. One cherry.

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:49.483
And my feet are killing me.

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:51.329
Man, I would love a foot rub.

01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:58.843
Liz, I'm not rubbing your feet.

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:00.966
Okay.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:03.490
Well, you wanna pray?

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:05.966
Yeah.

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.969
God, we thank you for this food.

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:13.127
And we thank you
for taking care of our family.

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:16.380
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:18.323
I'm starving. Let's eat.

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:24.687
It's good.

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:30.940
And you double checked your numbers.

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:34.060
Twice. Tony's inventory is off, Rick.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:37.164
We saw the same thing last week
when he left Asheville.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:41.003
He may just be padding numbers,
but there's a pattern here.

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.900
You're the district manager.
You gotta call this in.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.846
- Yeah. Thanks, Greg.
- Sorry, man. Later.

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:00.321
Why, Tony?

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:11.900
Hey, Danielle. Where's Daddy?

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.970
He left. He got a call
from his boss and had to go.

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:17.644
- From Rick?
- I think so.

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:20.966
- Did he say when he'd be back?
- No, ma'am.

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:25.325
I hear him.

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:55.686
Hey.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:04.820
Tony?

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:07.260
First off,
I don't want any grief from you. Okay?

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.931
'Cause I'm really not in the mood
to talk about this right now.

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:15.884
Tony, what's going on?

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.531
I just lost my job!

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:31.331
Okay. So, we'll just do
what we gotta do.

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:33.802
What, no sarcastic comment?

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:38.285
Tony, I think we'll be fine.

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:41.725
Liz, you heard me, right?
I just got fired!

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:46.980
Okay? So that means no income.
No company car. No health coverage.

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:49.003
We can't even afford this house anymore.

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:54.420
I understand.

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:58.570
Listen, I'll just pick up some new properties
while you look for a different job. Okay?

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:03.766
So, that's it?

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:06.845
You just gonna roll with it?

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:10.609
What else am I supposed to do?

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:15.243
Sometimes I don't get you, Liz.

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:20.005
I'll go start dinner.

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:35.681
Tony!

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:38.961
Please help me! Please!

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:40.886
Tony!

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:43.683
Tony, help me, please!

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:47.961
Tony!

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:51.322
Tony, no! No!

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:25.651
Danielle, have you seen my gym bag?

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:27.641
No, sir.

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:07.606
"Lord, I pray for Tony,
that you would turn his heart back to you.

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:12.460
"Help me to love him,
and give him a fresh love for me.

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:14.980
"I surrender my rights to you as Lord

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:20.740
"and ask you to bless him as he honors you
and to expose him if he walks in deceit.

01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:24.260
"Build him up as the man
you intend him to be.

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:29.127
"Help me to support and respect him.
I ask for your help to love him.

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:31.700
"In Jesus' name I pray."

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:32.926
Daddy?

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:36.980
I found your gym bag
next to the washing machine.

01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:39.651
Okay. You can just set it
right there, Danielle.

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:44.091
Hey, Danielle.

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:49.048
When did Mama do this to her closet?

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:51.970
A few weeks ago.

01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:02.211
- So, the whole closet was empty?
- Yeah, except the papers on the wall.

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:05.120
And what did she do with her clothes?

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:09.060
Mike, I don't know, man. Some other closet.
What does that matter?

01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:11.740
Dude, I don't think you understand
how important this is.

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:15.401
When was the last time you heard
of a woman giving up some closet space?

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:21.084
All I know is, you can fight against
your wife and probably hold your own.

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.439
But if God is fighting for her,

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.569
you can hit the gym
all you want to, bro.

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:28.170
It's not looking good for you.

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:30.607
Man!

01:08:31.319 --> 01:08:33.482
I wish my wife would pray
for me like that.

01:08:35.399 --> 01:08:38.051
Plus, I could use the closet space.

01:08:40.279 --> 01:08:42.939
All right, man, you good, yo.
I'm about to bounce.

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:44.087
- See you later, bro.
- All right.

01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:52.881
Excuse me.

01:08:53.319 --> 01:08:55.540
Can you tell Danielle
I'll be back to get her after practice?

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:56.819
- Sure, I'll tell her.
- All right.

01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.251
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:50.966
Tony! Please help me! Please!

01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:40.766
Jesus,

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:45.884
I'm not a good man.

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:57.011
I'm selfish.

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:02.685
I'm prideful.

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:10.488
And I'm hurting this family.

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:14.966
But this, this is not
who I wanted to be.

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:19.488
I don't like the man I've become,

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:24.528
but I don't know how to fix it.

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:28.970
I don't know what to do.

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:36.163
Forgive me, please.

01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:46.044
Forgive me, Jesus.

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:09.460
One, two, three, go.

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:11.324
Left, left, right.

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.804
Left, left, right.

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.361
Yes! Go!

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:28.164
One, two, three.

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:30.090
Left, left, right.

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:34.401
Hey, you know what?

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:39.210
I thought your jump roping routine
was gonna be something simple.

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:42.608
But it wasn't. It's pretty difficult.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:47.882
But you were really good, Danielle.
I mean, I was impressed.

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:51.045
You're really good.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.126
Thanks.

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:04.923
Daddy, why are they here?

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.802
They've come to get this car, Danielle.

01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:15.646
Excuse me.

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:23.011
- Rick.
- Tony.

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:24.806
I'm sorry about this.

01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:26.481
It's not your fault, Rick.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.526
Listen, I need you to sign
that we came for the car.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.445
And clean out any items
that belong to you.

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:33.167
Yep.

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:35.286
Already did.

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:38.724
You're a talented guy, Tony.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.331
I was sorry to see this happen.

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:44.845
- You take care.
- Yeah.

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.527
Why are they taking Daddy's car?

01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:51.100
We'll talk about it later, baby, okay?

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:52.260
Listen, why don't you go inside

01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:55.011
and knock out some chores
before lunch, all right? Okay.

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:14.780
I picked up a couple more houses
to sell this morning.

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:17.963
Asked Mandy to give me everything
she could for the next couple months.

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:20.286
That's good, Liz.

01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:23.441
Can we talk?

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:25.321
Sure.

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:38.527
I just don't understand
why you treat me this way.

01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:44.140
When I told you
what happened with my job,

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:45.620
I expected you to hit the ceiling, Liz.

01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:49.406
So, in my mind, I was ready
to defend myself.

01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:54.922
Except this time, I can't.

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:00.249
And I hate saying this...

01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:07.208
But I deserved to get fired.

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:10.766
I was deceiving them.

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:14.844
And I was deceiving you.

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:22.448
I almost cheated on you, Liz.

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:27.445
I thought about it.

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:31.171
I almost did it.

01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:37.964
But you know all this.

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:42.044
And you're still here.

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:45.689
Then I see your closet,

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:50.249
and the way you praying for me.

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.330
Why would you do that

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:01.407
when you see the type
of man I've become?

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:05.763
'Cause I'm not done with us.

01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:10.847
I will fight for our marriage.

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:15.285
But I've learned that my contentment
can't come from you.

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:19.846
Tony, I love you.

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:25.687
But I am His before I'm yours.

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:32.401
And because I love Jesus,
I'm staying right here.

01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:45.805
I'm sorry, Liz.

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:56.204
I asked God to forgive me,

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:00.004
but I need you to forgive me.

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:04.283
I don't want you to quit on me, Liz.

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:06.881
I will.

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:09.925
I forgive you.

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:12.645
I forgive you.

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:15.961
I'm sorry.

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:17.880
Thank you, Lord.

01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:28.083
And this just happened now?

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:29.606
He did?

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:32.085
Well, what'd he say?

01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:35.641
Oh, sweet Jesus. Lord!

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:42.327
See, I told you, Elizabeth.
I told you that God would fight for you.

01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:46.284
Oh, Jesus!
All right, baby, I'll talk to you soon.

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:55.564
Devil, you just got your butt kicked!

01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:58.962
My God is faithful.

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:02.165
And my God is powerful.

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:04.780
And my God is in charge.

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:08.580
You can't fire Him
and He'll never retire!

01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:10.887
Thank you, Jesus. Glory Hallelujah!

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:14.020
My God is good

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:18.011
My God is good, and He's faithful

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:20.940
Hey, Danielle.

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:22.121
Hey, Daddy.

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:34.248
Listen, I need to tell you something.

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:41.651
I don't think I've been
a very good dad to you.

01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:50.646
And I haven't been very loving
to your mother either.

01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:58.243
I can do better, Danielle.

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:01.481
You both deserve better from me.

01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:05.805
But you know what?

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:08.483
I've asked God to help me.

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:11.481
And

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.604
I wanted to ask you

01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:17.888
if you would forgive me

01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:20.728
and give me another chance.

01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:24.006
Think you can do that?

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:34.648
Listen, I do love you, Danielle.

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:38.845
I love you too, Daddy.

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:03.060
We're sorry. You have reached a number
that has been disconnected

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:05.242
or is no longer in service.

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:18.243
Slow down, I'm old. You know, I'm old now.
Okay, here we go.

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:22.287
Okay! I'm in there!

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:24.420
- Keep going!
- You got it!

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:25.965
Okay. I'm trying! My knees!

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:28.580
Here we go. Got the turn.

01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:30.921
What's the other move, Danielle?
Okay, wait.

01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:34.100
- Good grief!
- Daddy, why don't you jump with us?

01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:35.860
Yeah, that would be awesome!

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:37.883
No, no. I don't think
they let parents do that.

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:41.220
Yeah, they do. But no parents
do 'cause they can't keep up.

01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:43.322
- Oh, really?
- Dad, it's an open league.

01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:45.761
You can jump in the freestyle competition.
They'll let you.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.004
Look, tell you what.
Let me think about it, okay?

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:50.740
Okay, I'll think about it. All right?

01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:52.980
Now if I'm gonna do it, I wanna do it right.
So let's try it again.

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:54.740
Get it going. Get it going for me.

01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:57.300
Okay, here we go.
Here we go. Okay. Okay.

01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:59.880
All right, here we go.
Turn. And we turn...

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:16.241
Tony?

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:26.645
Tony, what are you doing?

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:30.731
I'm struggling.

01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:36.641
With what?

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:48.321
What is this?

01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:51.331
It was my bonus plan.

01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:54.011
Where did you get these?

01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:59.367
I've been keeping some for myself
each time I take samples to a client.

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:02.969
I thought they had to sign
for what you gave them.

01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:05.129
There's ways around that, Liz.

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:10.128
Tony, you gotta take these back.

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:12.842
Liz, I could be prosecuted for this.

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:19.929
Look, I've already lost my job.

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:24.281
So, now I'm supposed to go and tell Danielle
her daddy might be going to jail?

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:30.169
Then why are you struggling?

01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:48.020
What you have there
is fourth-quarter projections.

01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:49.700
Now, if anything's off on that, don't...

01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:52.246
Coleman, Tony Jordan's here to see you.

01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:56.820
- Do you know what he wants?
- He didn't say.

01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:59.241
Just said he wants five minutes
of your time.

01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:09.483
Tony? Coleman's waiting for you
in the conference room.

01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:11.606
Thank you.

01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:29.726
Hello, Tony.

01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:32.765
Coleman. Tom.

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:36.602
Look, I appreciate you guys
meeting with me.

01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:40.460
I just need to bring you something back
that belongs to the company,

01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:41.891
and apologize for taking it.

01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:44.285
What's in the box?

01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:57.340
You weren't just padding your numbers,

01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:01.570
you were stealing samples
and selling them. Is that right?

01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:07.763
Let me get this straight.

01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:12.485
We give you a high salary
with awards and benefits and trips,

01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:16.488
and you decide to thank us
by taking even more for yourself?

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.082
Do you realize
we could have you prosecuted for this?

01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:21.281
Tom.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.809
Why would you bring this in now?

01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:43.644
Because I needed to confess what I've done
and ask for your forgiveness.

01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:45.691
Forgiveness?

01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:49.580
I mean, how long
have you been doing this?

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:51.170
How much money did you make?

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:53.481
About $19,000.

01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:55.166
19,000?

01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:58.089
- Is that all? Really?
- Tom.

01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:07.924
Tony, it doesn't make sense
that you would do this

01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:09.929
after you've already been terminated.

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:12.971
I realize that.

01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:17.089
But I've gotten right with my family.
I've gotten right with God.

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:19.929
But I need to get right with you.

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:24.046
So I'm ready to accept
whatever decision you make.

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:27.610
Including arrest?

01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:30.605
Whatever the consequence.

01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:34.020
That makes it easier for us.

01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:36.805
- Coleman, it's time to call the authorities.
- Not yet.

01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:40.803
Tony, are you willing
to sign a statement?

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:43.401
I am.

01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:45.850
Then I want two days to think about it.

01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:47.645
- Two days?
- Yes.

01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:51.725
You'll hear from me by then.

01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:54.287
Thank you.

01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:07.100
Hey, girls. Why don't you go inside
and grab something cold to drink?

01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:08.531
Okay? We can start back in a little bit.

01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:09.926
- Okay. Thanks, Ms. Jordan.
- All right.

01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:12.891
Hey. Hey.

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:17.041
Well?

01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:20.086
I don't know.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.651
I mean, Tom just wanted
to throw me in jail.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.048
But Coleman says he wants two days
to think about it.

01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:30.850
- Really? Did he seem angry?
- I couldn't tell.

01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:36.060
Liz, this was the most awkward thing
I've ever done.

01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:37.491
Yeah, but you did it.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.128
Listen, you did the right thing.

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:43.129
Now we just have to pray and wait.

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:48.380
Hey, why don't you go change?
Just come practice with your daughter.

01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:50.780
Liz, why should I practice
for a competition when I might be in jail?

01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:52.644
You don't know that.

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:55.967
Whatever happens, we trust God, right?

01:26:57.680 --> 01:26:58.761
Right.

01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:05.688
This is crazy. You know that, right?

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:16.281
You're nervous.

01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:19.810
Trying not to think about it.

01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:21.924
What time are you supposed to be there?

01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:24.806
9:00.

01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:40.083
- Coleman?
- Hello, Tony.

01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:43.167
- Hi, Elizabeth.
- Hi, Coleman. How are you?

01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:44.580
I'm fine, thank you.

01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:48.765
I know this is unexpected, but I wondered
if you might give me a few minutes to talk.

01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:51.926
- Yeah, sure. Come on in.
- Thank you.

01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:00.921
Tony, I've been thinking
about your visit.

01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:05.449
It's probably all I've thought about
the past two days.

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:08.090
What you did was wrong.

01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:10.764
And I was disappointed.

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:17.486
But we've fired salesmen before,
and well, life goes on.

01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:22.082
But then you showed back up.

01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:28.605
And, Tony, I've never seen anybody do
what you did.

01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:35.020
I've never seen a man take total
responsibility for his wrongdoing,

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:36.963
no matter the consequence.

01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:40.843
And I kept asking myself, why?

01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:43.490
Why would you do that?

01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:47.643
The only answer I can come up with

01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:51.445
is that you were sincere
in your desire to make it right,

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:54.282
and that you regret what you've done.

01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:57.488
So I've chosen to believe you.

01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:01.483
I can't give you your job back,

01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:06.482
but I've decided not to prosecute.

01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:19.691
I do think it would be appropriate
to return the $19,000 back to the company.

01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:26.240
- Yeah, we've already decided to do that.
- Very good.

01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:30.009
Well, if you'll sign an agreement
to that effect,

01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:32.609
I think we should all move on.

01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:38.841
So if you don't mind me seeing myself out,
I'll give you your evening back.

01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:45.500
- Thank you, Tony.
- Thank you.

01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:47.284
- Elizabeth.
- Thank you.

01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:08.722
Tony, that was grace!

01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:15.885
That was God's grace toward us.

01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:24.250
Thank you, Jesus.

01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:58.125
I just love these old houses.
They have so much character.

01:31:58.240 --> 01:31:59.340
Yeah. I agree.

01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:05.020
Well, the master bath was updated recently,
but she kept the original tub.

01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:07.420
And all the tiles are brand new.

01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:11.445
And, you know, I think this is best of all,
the floor is original hardwoods.

01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:15.020
- I love hardwood floors.
- And you know what I found?

01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:17.420
The neighborhood is so great
because it's established.

01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:21.684
And quiet, you know? It seems mature.
How long have you guys been in ministry?

01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:25.803
Charles pastored the same church
for 35 years.

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:29.780
But, you know, we loved it,
but we knew it was time for a change,

01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:33.726
and we wanted to be near our kids
and grandkids to help mentor them.

01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:37.290
Charles, what are you doing?

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:42.483
Someone's been praying in this closet.

01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:46.648
That's right. That was her prayer closet.
How did you know that?

01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:51.165
It's almost like it's baked in.

01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:59.640
Ma'am, we'll take the house.

01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:11.740
Well, hello. Come on in.
You must be Elizabeth.

01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:14.810
- Yes, thank you.
- Hey, there, young lady.

01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:19.481
- You're C.W. Williams, the city manager.
- I am.

01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:22.220
- You're Clyde?
- I'm Clyde.

01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:25.740
- You got to be kidding me.
- Hey, Elizabeth!

01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:28.420
- Hey, Danielle!
- Nice to meet you.

01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:29.931
I'll let you all catch up.

01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:33.804
You never told me that your son
was the city manager!

01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:37.083
I didn't? My son's the city manager.

01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:40.287
Okay. I got some good news for you.

01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:43.205
I bet you gonna tell me

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:49.724
that a retired pastor from Texas
and his wife wanna buy my house.

01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:51.320
Now see,

01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:53.860
see, that's the kind of relationship
with God I want.

01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:56.281
I want Him speaking to me like that.
What did He say?

01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:58.140
Well, it was actually your daughter.

01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:01.562
She texted me on my new smart phone
on the way over here.

01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:06.300
Don't be mad, Mom!
I hardly get to text anybody!

01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:08.380
And this thing is so handy.

01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:11.700
I've already downloaded
a couple prayer apps,

01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:14.121
and got a couple gospel songs.

01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:19.980
All right, guys.

01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:22.580
Wanna take these popsicles outside,
eat them on the back porch?

01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:26.969
Here we go. Two hot cups of coffee.

01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:29.962
Well, if it's hot, then I'll drink it.

01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:36.180
Now, we're still gonna get together
for our little chats, right?

01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:37.420
Oh, yes!

01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:41.140
- But now it can't just be the both of us.
- What do you mean?

01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:45.928
You need to find a young woman
to invest in, and I'll do the same.

01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:49.405
We all need help every now and then.

01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:54.540
Ms. Clara, I really can't tell you
how much your friendship means to me.

01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:56.580
That goes for the both of us.

01:34:56.680 --> 01:35:00.844
No, really. I wasn't willing to admit
how much help I needed.

01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:04.220
And I needed somebody to wake me up

01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:07.767
from the insanity of doing
the same thing over and over.

01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:10.442
You've been a gift from God to me.

01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:13.725
Don't you think that
this has been one-sided.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.980
This has meant more to me than you know.

01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:19.161
Well, good.

01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:23.740
I can't imagine how much your prayers
and your passion for God

01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:25.220
must have meant to your husband.

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:27.129
Gosh, I wish I could've met him.

01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:29.566
No.

01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:31.651
No, you don't.

01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:35.126
See, I wasn't the same woman back then.

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:40.086
When Leo died,
we were not on good terms.

01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:47.327
I always felt pushed to the back burner
while the military took first place in his life.

01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:52.602
And I was... I was bitter, Elizabeth.
I was so bitter.

01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:57.646
But even then,
God was showing me what to do.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:04.803
He was prompting me to fight for Leo,
to pray for Leo, and I refused.

01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:10.203
And I kept pushing it back
and pushing it back until it was too late.

01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:18.809
And there's no grief as great
as denying the truth until it's too late.

01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:22.328
It was my selfish pride, Elizabeth.

01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:26.688
My selfish pride!

01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:31.848
And I confessed it.

01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:37.848
And I repented,
and I begged God to forgive me.

01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:41.288
But I still have a scar.

01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:47.361
And then I started spending more time
with the Lord,

01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:49.564
and in His word.

01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:53.846
And I learned how to fight

01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:56.484
in prayer first.

01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:02.124
I'm an old woman now.

01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:09.084
And I realized that I have not passed on
what I had learned.

01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:14.205
And when I last visited Leo's grave,

01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:18.403
I asked God to send me someone
that I could help.

01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:23.048
Someone that I could teach to fight
the right way.

01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:28.488
And He sent me Elizabeth Jordan.

01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:35.211
So you see, you,

01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:42.121
you were the answer to my prayer.

01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:50.966
Well, now you've got to teach
other people to seek the Lord.

01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:55.288
You've got to teach other young wives
how to fight.

01:37:56.520 --> 01:37:58.682
Yeah. I will.

01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:01.646
I will.

01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:13.420
- Mom, did you bring my snack?
- Yeah, baby, I got it right here.

01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:16.330
- Hey, Danielle, are you nervous?
- Very.

01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:19.167
- Are you nervous?
- Oh, yeah!

01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:22.340
But I'll be fine just as long as
I don't fall on my face.

01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:24.060
Are you still gonna do that flip?

01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:26.580
Yeah, I'm gonna do the flip.
And that's not all.

01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:30.220
Huh, Danielle?
You ain't seen nothing yet, Liz.

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:32.004
Now I'm nervous.

01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:36.970
Tony, isn't that Tom?

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:41.045
Yeah, it is.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.365
Looks like a flat.

01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:47.209
No. No! No. No, I can't wait that long!

01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:51.811
Why do you promote helping out
in 30 minutes when it takes 45 to get here?

01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:55.300
Listen, you guys stay put.

01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:58.085
You know, I don't care.
Just send someone!

01:39:57.800 --> 01:39:59.529
Why did you do that?

01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:03.046
'Cause that's how
I wanna be treated, Danielle.

01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:23.761
Wow!

01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:27.220
I'm so proud of you
for everything that you've done.

01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:29.780
And I just can't wait to see
what you guys do out there.

01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:31.300
- You wanna say something to them?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:34.180
- Okay, good.
- Listen, I just spoke with the judges. Okay?

01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:36.681
- They've agreed to let us go last. All right?
- Yes!

01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:39.380
Remember what we talked about?
We'll be the last thing they see.

01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:42.740
We'll be impressive. All right?
Listen, I know you guys are nervous.

01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:44.100
Believe me, I am, too.

01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:47.540
But we're gonna take that nervous energy
and we're gonna turn it into rocket fuel.

01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:48.860
- All right? You guys are with me?
- Yeah.

01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:50.020
All right, let's blow them away.

01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:52.820
Here we go. Comets on three.
All right, one, two, three.

01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:54.160
Comets!

01:40:56.480 --> 01:40:58.700
Welcome to the
Double Dutch Citywide Championship.

01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:00.564
Who's ready for an awesome day?

01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:07.640
All right. We're getting started right now
with the speed round. Here we go!

01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:40.500
All right, so the speed scores
will be added to the freestyle scores.

01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:42.820
So let's start
the freestyle competition.

01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:44.763
First up is the Moon Jumpers.

01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:56.281
Next up is the Mustangs!

01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:12.966
Now let's give it up for the Tigers!

01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:28.567
Here come the SkipSations!

01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:47.767

Let's hear it for the Comets!

01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:00.325
That's my dad! That's my dad!

01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:08.660
The judges' scores are in.

01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:12.810

And now our Double Dutch
Citywide Champions for this year,

01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:43.891
let's hear it for the Speed Angels!

01:45:58.320 --> 01:45:59.970
Hey, what are you doing?

01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:02.811
- Hey, hey.
- What's going on?

01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:08.300
I'll tell you in a minute, okay?
How was dinner?

01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:09.686
It was good.

01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:12.020
Cynthia actually agreed to meet with me
on a regular basis.

01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:13.180
Good. Good.

01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:15.567
- We'll try Tuesday afternoons to start.
- Okay.

01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:18.740
Now listen, did they forgive me
for not helping them out?

01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:20.649
Yeah. I think so.

01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:24.220
You know, they really appreciated
the $500 we gave them though.

01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:27.420
I told her we really wanted to do more
but we just couldn't right now

01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:29.249
the way things are tight with money.

01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:31.886
She understood. But we did skip dessert.

01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:33.611
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:37.460
Well, listen, I got something
I need to tell you. Okay?

01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:40.140
Now I want you to think about it
before you respond, okay?

01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:41.526
What is it?

01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:46.520
I had an interview today.
And I got offered the job on the spot.

01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:48.286
To do what?

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.480
To be the new director
at the community center.

01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:56.001
Liz, we know this place so well.
You know?

01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:00.130
I'm telling you, I can do this job.

01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:03.086
Gosh. You would be closer to home.

01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:08.330
It's only half the pay,
but if we're wise, I know we can make it.

01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:12.485
Listen to me.

01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:17.810
I would rather have a man chasing Jesus
than a house full of stuff.

01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:21.401
Okay.

01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:24.129
All right, then I'll accept it.

01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:28.660
You know what, I'm kind of glad
you didn't have that dessert tonight.

01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:29.940
Why?

01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:34.045
I got something for you.
Why don't you have a seat on the couch?

01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:36.260
- What?
- Just head to the couch.

01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:38.203
I got this, don't worry about it.

01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:44.086
Where's Danielle?

01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:48.420
She's fine. She's over at Jennifer's house.
They're having a sleepover. Yeah.

01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:49.931
What is this?

01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:52.286
You'll see.

01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:55.100
No, no, no. Tony, don't touch my feet.

01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:58.647
Hey. Just roll with it. Okay?
All right, come on now.

01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:11.608
Oh, my goodness, it feels so good.

01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:16.526
Now it's time I give you
what you deserve.

01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:21.931
This is for the woman I don't deserve.

01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:29.980
You go ahead and work on that,

01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:34.608
and I am gonna get started on that
foot massage you've been asking for.

01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:37.160
Really?

01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:41.290
- Are you really doing this for me?
- Yeah, come on now.

01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:45.820
No, no, no, Tony!
I don't want you to smell my feet.

01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:50.369
Babe, look. I told you,
I got this. You... Look.

01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:55.845
You need to trust me, okay?
So, like that.

01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:01.020
I'm ready to go. You hear me?

01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:02.804
- You're terrible.
- Yeah.

01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:07.961
What's wrong?

01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:10.648
I'm eating my favorite dessert

01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:15.291
while my husband is rubbing my feet.

01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:22.806
There has got to be a God in Heaven!

01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:06.564
You've done it again, Lord.

01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:09.170
You've done it again.

01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:16.971
You are good and You are mighty
and You are merciful!

01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:23.260
And You keep taking care of me
when I don't deserve it.

01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:25.408
Praise You, Jesus!

01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:28.448
You are Lord.

01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:34.243
Give me another one, Lord.

01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:39.167
Guide me to who You want me to help.

01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:44.121
Raise up more that will call upon
Your name!

01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:49.820
Raise up those that love You
and seek You and trust You!

01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:52.730
Raise them up, Lord! Raise them up!

01:50:53.800 --> 01:51:00.081
Lord, we need a generation of believers
who are not ashamed of the gospel.

01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:04.083
We need an army of believers, Lord,

01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:07.447
that hate to be lukewarm

01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:11.940
and will stand on Your word
above all else.

01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:14.964
Raise them up, Lord. Raise them up.

01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:20.081
I pray for unity among
those that love You.

01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:26.445
I pray that You open their eyes
so that they can see Your truth, Lord.

01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:31.967
I pray for Your hand
of protection and guidance!

01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:39.370
Raise up a generation, Lord,
that will take light into this world.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:43.340
That will not compromise
when under pressure!

01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:47.968
That will not cower, Lord,
when others fall away!

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:52.980
Raise them up, Lord,
that they will proclaim

01:51:53.080 --> 01:51:57.881
that there is salvation
in the name of Jesus Christ!

01:51:58.160 --> 01:52:02.688
Raise up warriors, Lord,
who will fight on their knees,

01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:06.647
who will worship You
with their whole hearts, Lord.

01:52:07.080 --> 01:52:09.765
Lord, call us to battle,

01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:15.649
that we may proclaim You
King of Kings and Lord of Lords!

01:52:16.840 --> 01:52:20.367
I pray these things with all my heart!

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:25.049
Raise them up, Lord! Raise them up!
