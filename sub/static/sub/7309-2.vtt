00:19.164 --> 00:20.461
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:20.730 --> 00:21.969
Try this one.

00:23.673 --> 00:25.313
- Emily.
- Yes?

00:25.949 --> 00:26.650
Come here.

00:26.674 --> 00:28.543
They haven't called our number yet.

00:28.772 --> 00:29.968
I know.

00:30.412 --> 00:32.154
Relax agent Fornell.

00:33.076 --> 00:34.106
She's fine.

00:36.714 --> 00:40.554
I didn't expect to see
you again until... 2067?

00:42.081 --> 00:43.658
I got a reprieve.

00:44.879 --> 00:47.129
You're not going to use that
in front of your daughter.

00:47.686 --> 00:49.125
I don't need a gun to take you down.

00:49.149 --> 00:51.806
- You wouldn't hurt a innocent man.
- I'm not looking at one.

00:51.889 --> 00:54.087
That's where you and
agent Gibbs got it wrong.

00:55.500 --> 00:57.433
Agent Gibbs is retired.

00:57.514 --> 01:00.035
I know. Why do you think
I'm talking to you?

01:00.093 --> 01:02.756
I have no idea. Why
don't you enlighten me.

01:02.819 --> 01:05.629
I told you. You got the wrong guy.

01:05.662 --> 01:07.735
And if there's a shred
of decency in you,

01:07.798 --> 01:09.210
and brains...

01:10.227 --> 01:12.808
you'll re-open my case
and find the right one.

01:18.861 --> 01:20.221
Now I'm going to walk out of here.

01:20.692 --> 01:22.001
You'll want to follow.

01:22.138 --> 01:23.715
But you'll realize something

01:23.969 --> 01:26.141
and end up just reaching
for that cell instead.

01:26.187 --> 01:27.506
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:27.538 --> 01:28.722
What's that?

01:29.491 --> 01:30.979
I might not be alone.

01:35.932 --> 01:37.699
- See you, sweetie.
- Bye.

03:15.907 --> 03:18.272
The basement needs some work.

03:18.305 --> 03:20.671
But if it doesn't showed "wine cellar,"

03:20.709 --> 03:22.133
I don't know what does.

03:22.184 --> 03:23.354
Have a look.

03:23.389 --> 03:25.207
And I'll be right back.

03:28.507 --> 03:31.126
- First my wife, now my house?
- No.

03:31.406 --> 03:32.868
No, I learned lesson.

03:33.059 --> 03:34.750
I'm through with your leftovers.

03:36.524 --> 03:38.779
You're going to need a
bigger box for that boat.

03:38.811 --> 03:41.642
You come all the way out here
to give me packing tips, Tobias?

03:41.715 --> 03:43.393
Actually, I came to tell you that.

03:43.431 --> 03:46.979
Petty Officer Derrick Paulson
escaped form prison yesterday.

03:51.036 --> 03:52.036
No.

03:52.235 --> 03:53.808
I haven't asked you anything yet.

03:55.539 --> 03:57.462
You caught him last time.

03:57.986 --> 04:00.148
Figured you might like
to catch him again.

04:00.247 --> 04:01.418
You thought wrong.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.712
He came to see me, Jethro.

04:06.284 --> 04:07.588
When I was with Emily.

04:13.774 --> 04:14.855
She okay?

04:14.880 --> 04:15.928
For now.

04:16.512 --> 04:19.286
He just wanted to tell me
that I got the wrong man,

04:19.345 --> 04:22.436
and strongly suggested that
I reopen his case to prove it.

04:22.484 --> 04:24.773
He's risking a lot for something
he's knows can't happen.

04:24.822 --> 04:25.838
You think?

04:26.966 --> 04:27.967
I don't know what his game is.

04:27.991 --> 04:29.271
But I'm not going to
get a good night's sleep

04:29.295 --> 04:31.229
until that S.O.B. is back behind bars.

04:31.279 --> 04:32.791
You don't need me to find him.

04:34.522 --> 04:35.522
Need?

04:37.484 --> 04:40.321
A convicted killer was two
inches from my daughter!

04:40.377 --> 04:41.434
Handing her crayons.

04:41.484 --> 04:42.484
He touched her!

04:43.810 --> 04:45.949
We're way beyond need, Jethro.

04:53.562 --> 04:54.927
Nice tan.

05:03.751 --> 05:05.114
It's really not that bad, McGee.

05:05.164 --> 05:07.407
For a spy, you're a horrible liar.

05:07.455 --> 05:08.264
Ziva's right.

05:08.304 --> 05:09.664
You can hardly notice.

05:09.823 --> 05:11.078
But... But?

05:11.428 --> 05:14.221
I wouldn't let Agent
DiNozzo see it if I were you.

05:14.321 --> 05:15.466
Let Agent DiNozzo see what?

05:15.998 --> 05:16.998
Nothing.

05:17.719 --> 05:19.070
Why are you mumbling, McGee?

05:19.118 --> 05:20.310
I'm not mumbling.

05:24.030 --> 05:25.242
Well, you either just said

05:25.292 --> 05:28.042
"mimes aren't rumbling"
or "I'm not mumbling."

05:28.092 --> 05:29.927
And I don't see any mimes.

05:33.034 --> 05:34.067
Agent Lee,

05:34.099 --> 05:35.919
why is Agent McGee mumbling?

05:36.078 --> 05:38.287
He over-bleached his teeth, sir.

05:40.131 --> 05:42.621
Apparently, he fell asleep while wearing

05:42.671 --> 05:44.939
his bleaching tray, sir.

05:45.003 --> 05:46.604
You don't watch Friends, do you?

05:46.667 --> 05:47.797
Same thing happened to Ross.

05:47.859 --> 05:49.938
You could have learned
from our friend's mistake.

05:49.969 --> 05:53.021
But you choose to read instead.

05:53.085 --> 05:54.400
Better let me see the damage.

05:58.403 --> 06:00.343
As team leader, people,

06:00.393 --> 06:03.106
I need to be aware of any condition

06:03.130 --> 06:04.791
that might affect an agent's ability

06:04.841 --> 06:08.005
to perform his or her duties.

06:08.055 --> 06:09.399
And what does having embarrassingly

06:09.423 --> 06:12.206
white teeth have to do
with performing his duties?

06:12.256 --> 06:13.915
You said it was not that bad.

06:13.965 --> 06:15.205
She lied.

06:15.285 --> 06:17.049
- Open up your mouth.
- No.

06:17.093 --> 06:18.032
- Let me see the Chiclets.
- No.

06:18.098 --> 06:19.074
Let me see 'em.

06:19.098 --> 06:20.813
- No.
- Open your...

06:21.065 --> 06:22.065
Gibbs.

06:25.431 --> 06:26.431
What is...?

06:26.483 --> 06:27.483
I have no idea.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.197
Agent Gibbs! I mean, Mister...

06:35.584 --> 06:36.928
Just as I was getting used to

06:36.960 --> 06:39.773
my door being treated as a door.

06:40.091 --> 06:41.895
I'll call you back, Todd.

06:42.133 --> 06:44.088
I need a temporary reinstatement.

06:44.136 --> 06:45.269
I assume you're here

06:45.324 --> 06:47.891
because of ex-Petty
Officer Derrick Paulson.

06:47.915 --> 06:49.977
I read Agent Fornell's report.

06:50.374 --> 06:53.939
Why the sudden, if temporary,

06:53.963 --> 06:55.380
interest in bank robbers?

06:55.409 --> 06:58.500
If you've read Fornell's report,
Jen, then you already know.

06:58.564 --> 06:59.454
We're wasting time.

06:59.518 --> 07:01.298
It's not that simple, Jethro.

07:01.361 --> 07:02.426
You left.

07:02.474 --> 07:04.755
I appreciate what you did for Ziva,

07:04.993 --> 07:06.722
but this is not some gym membership

07:06.772 --> 07:07.675
that you can turn on and off.

07:07.723 --> 07:10.321
No, I can't; But I'm
not director of NCIS.

07:10.345 --> 07:11.965
And the director of NCIS

07:12.015 --> 07:13.770
already filed your retirement package

07:13.834 --> 07:15.153
with Navy Human Resources.

07:15.185 --> 07:16.091
Un-file it.

07:16.139 --> 07:18.004
It doesn't work that way, Jethro.

07:18.054 --> 07:19.866
It would take weeks to reinstate you.

07:19.898 --> 07:21.835
And that's even if you
managed to pass your...

07:21.885 --> 07:23.553
My psych evaluation?

07:24.388 --> 07:28.949
Or are you talking about my
firearms proficiency exam?

07:29.569 --> 07:30.650
No.

07:31.176 --> 07:33.385
That one I'm not worried about.

07:36.277 --> 07:37.438
Wait.

07:43.470 --> 07:44.979
Let me at least...

07:47.701 --> 07:49.271
validate your parking.

07:52.740 --> 07:54.869
That's strange.

07:55.311 --> 07:58.028
I could've sworn I filed this.

07:59.356 --> 08:01.438
Your retirement package.

08:02.931 --> 08:06.834
I must have accidentally put in

08:06.881 --> 08:10.235
for your unused leave time instead.

08:11.597 --> 08:13.003
Of which, it seems,

08:13.053 --> 08:15.369
there are six days left

08:15.496 --> 08:17.817
until it has to be filed.

08:23.979 --> 08:26.539
Come on, don't tell me you
don't eavesdrop, Cynthia.

08:26.589 --> 08:27.979
Every director's assistant eavesdrops.

08:28.003 --> 08:29.375
He's coming. He's coming.

08:31.827 --> 08:32.844
Hey, Gibbs.

08:32.876 --> 08:34.529
Just visiting the neighborhood or...

08:34.577 --> 08:36.643
taking your desk back?

08:38.299 --> 08:39.299
Let's go.

08:49.251 --> 08:51.262
You should've been
here half an hour ago.

08:51.286 --> 08:52.530
Yeah, I'm just getting Emily settled

08:52.554 --> 08:55.049
- at my mom's place.
- Want me to send an agent over?

08:55.096 --> 08:56.638
How many can you spare?

08:57.072 --> 08:58.296
Okay, I've got an idea.

08:58.344 --> 09:01.109
Maybe he lost his memory again
and forgot he quit his job.

09:01.157 --> 09:02.877
Wouldn't he be sitting
at his old desk then?

09:02.949 --> 09:04.785
If Gibbs wanted us to
know what he was doing,

09:04.835 --> 09:06.511
he would've told us. Oh, right.

09:06.561 --> 09:07.841
Because he would never expect us

09:07.865 --> 09:09.227
to figure it out for ourselves.

09:09.298 --> 09:12.532
Gibbs is back... on
temporary assignment.

09:12.779 --> 09:13.898
The Paulson case.

09:13.964 --> 09:14.964
Paulson?!

09:15.016 --> 09:17.459
Petty Officer Derrick
Paulson: Knocked over a bank,

09:17.509 --> 09:19.419
killed two of his accomplices,
money was never found.

09:19.443 --> 09:20.985
Paulson's prison cell.

09:21.016 --> 09:22.133
I want to see what was in it.

09:22.157 --> 09:23.631
I've already sent the contents over.

09:23.681 --> 09:25.475
Maybe your techs can find
something mine didn't.

09:25.499 --> 09:26.767
Bye, Daddy!

09:26.817 --> 09:27.817
I'm worried.

09:28.149 --> 09:29.889
She'll be fine, Tobias.

09:29.939 --> 09:31.489
Paulson isn't after her.

09:32.222 --> 09:33.591
I ruined his life, Jethro.

09:33.830 --> 09:35.512
We don't know what he's after.

09:41.504 --> 09:42.229
Anything good?

09:42.337 --> 09:43.459
Yeah.

09:43.671 --> 09:46.399
It's a jailhouse appeal
from some escaped convict.

09:46.447 --> 09:47.847
The guy really knows his forensics.

09:51.504 --> 09:53.925
I knew it! I knew it!

09:55.522 --> 09:58.065
Won't need these anymore now
that you're actually here.

09:58.113 --> 09:59.571
I knew you'd come back.

09:59.603 --> 10:00.748
I'm not back.

10:00.779 --> 10:03.223
Of course you're back.
I can feel your badge.

10:03.398 --> 10:05.130
That is your badge, right?

10:06.966 --> 10:08.635
You are back.

10:08.836 --> 10:11.714
Reinstatement's only temporary, Abs.

10:12.700 --> 10:15.163
Until I can find Paulson.

10:16.824 --> 10:17.879
We'll see about that.

10:17.929 --> 10:19.375
So what can I do for you,

10:19.399 --> 10:21.943
temporarily reinstated Agent Gibbs?

10:21.993 --> 10:23.809
Process the contents of Paulson's cell.

10:23.858 --> 10:25.248
What am I looking for?

10:25.272 --> 10:27.807
Oh, right. Anything
to help you find him.

10:27.855 --> 10:30.449
I want to know what he was
up to before he escaped.

10:30.477 --> 10:33.950
Unless the three of you
have any other suggestions.

10:36.763 --> 10:37.763
Uh...

10:39.541 --> 10:40.541
Hey...

10:40.952 --> 10:42.323
We were, we were just, uh,

10:42.390 --> 10:44.024
eavesdropping like little girls.

10:44.091 --> 10:45.748
But we do have suggestions.

10:46.145 --> 10:46.991
Prison records show

10:47.019 --> 10:49.923
that only one person ever
came to visit Paulson in jail.

10:50.038 --> 10:52.832
Mickey Stokes, 72. Former Navy sailor.

10:52.882 --> 10:54.353
And since Paulson has no family,

10:54.403 --> 10:56.493
we should assume that
he'll try to contact Mickey.

10:56.561 --> 10:58.009
And I already have an address.

10:58.095 --> 10:59.427
Tony, Ziva, you're with me.

10:59.494 --> 11:00.966
McGee, stay here and...

11:01.125 --> 11:01.661
McGee, stay here, help Abby.

11:01.728 --> 11:02.728
Help Abby...

11:03.928 --> 11:05.818
process Paulson's belongings.

11:05.881 --> 11:07.582
Then gargle this.

11:08.011 --> 11:10.204
Before the rest of us go snow-blind.

11:20.668 --> 11:22.857
Gibbs seemed awfully quiet in the car.

11:22.921 --> 11:25.338
It's not like you were giving
him a chance to talk, Tony.

11:25.394 --> 11:27.761
What, are you nervous he's
going to want his old job back?

11:27.828 --> 11:29.360
No. I'm just bringing him up to speed

11:29.427 --> 11:30.621
on the latest protocols.

11:30.973 --> 11:32.627
What took you hotshots so long?

11:32.677 --> 11:34.435
He's been waiting over an hour.

11:34.485 --> 11:36.419
Hey, shoes off!

11:38.314 --> 11:39.314
Clear.

11:39.760 --> 11:40.760
Clear.

11:40.936 --> 11:42.049
Where is he?

11:42.318 --> 11:44.131
I never said he was here.

11:46.666 --> 11:47.449
Gibbs.

11:47.499 --> 11:49.139
Didn't expect to hear your voice.

11:49.189 --> 11:50.138
I heard you quit.

11:50.206 --> 11:51.125
Retired.

11:51.172 --> 11:52.483
At your age,

11:52.507 --> 11:53.225
that's quitting.

11:53.266 --> 11:54.469
Why don't you turn yourself in,

11:54.493 --> 11:56.270
you can tell me about this in person.

11:56.397 --> 11:58.091
Turn myself in for what?

11:58.123 --> 11:59.680
I'm an innocent man.

11:59.878 --> 12:01.445
Try broken record.

12:01.810 --> 12:03.956
So you're not going to reopen my case?

12:03.988 --> 12:06.258
We both know what I'll find
if I do, so why don't you

12:06.375 --> 12:07.917
tell me what you really want.

12:07.941 --> 12:10.548
I already got it, Agent Gibbs.

12:11.497 --> 12:12.793
So what does he really want?

12:12.828 --> 12:14.386
Our Car.

12:26.648 --> 12:28.174
They appear to be close.

12:28.953 --> 12:29.898
Well, they say the way

12:29.922 --> 12:32.005
to a man's heart is through his stomach.

12:33.809 --> 12:35.461
Meals on Wheels.

12:35.700 --> 12:38.132
Looks like Paulson was a volunteer.

12:38.259 --> 12:41.446
He volunteered to
put... meals on wheels?

12:43.440 --> 12:45.634
They bring food to the elderly, Ziva.

12:45.701 --> 12:47.553
Of course I helped him!

12:47.601 --> 12:49.234
Derrick was like a son to me.

12:49.265 --> 12:51.594
I was the closest
thing he had to family.

12:51.618 --> 12:54.097
What would you do if it
was your kid in trouble?

12:54.129 --> 12:57.371
I would've told him to give
himself up before he got hurt.

12:57.884 --> 13:00.703
I'm glad you ain't my old man, Fornell.

13:01.050 --> 13:02.912
Shoes off!

13:08.221 --> 13:09.565
And I certainly wouldn't let him

13:09.615 --> 13:10.469
steal my car.

13:10.533 --> 13:12.885
Didn't. It was DiNozzo's car.

13:12.953 --> 13:15.141
He just wants you to reopen his case!

13:15.191 --> 13:17.896
You been reading my letters
the past four years?

13:17.944 --> 13:20.467
You bozos got the wrong guy.

13:20.514 --> 13:22.660
Paulson took advantage of you, Mickey.

13:22.859 --> 13:25.676
He only brought you food because you
lived near the bank he was casing.

13:25.762 --> 13:29.042
You wasted your life savings
defending the wrong guy.

13:29.073 --> 13:29.916
Hey!

13:29.963 --> 13:31.549
Not my computer!

13:31.581 --> 13:33.917
I got an online date tonight.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.325
Where is he, Mickey?

13:38.248 --> 13:39.552
He doesn't know.

13:40.473 --> 13:41.546
You sure?

13:41.959 --> 13:44.184
Want to hit him for
aiding and abetting?

13:45.422 --> 13:47.815
He did shelter Paulson,
he gave him money.

13:47.865 --> 13:48.901
I say we use him as bait.

13:48.964 --> 13:52.350
Give Mickey a pass, put a man on
him in case Paulson comes back?

13:58.620 --> 13:59.939
You're the boss.

14:03.801 --> 14:04.801
Yeah?

14:05.469 --> 14:06.469
Where?

14:06.889 --> 14:08.208
Anything in it?

14:10.564 --> 14:13.409
D.C. Metro just found our
car half a mile from here.

14:13.489 --> 14:15.461
The only thing missing was my laptop.

14:15.511 --> 14:17.347
And every file we had on Paulson.

14:17.379 --> 14:19.008
I told you, he just... he just wants

14:19.058 --> 14:20.124
to work on his case.

14:20.184 --> 14:22.656
Except he's had all his
case files since the trial.

14:22.711 --> 14:24.271
Perhaps ours have something his didn't.

14:24.305 --> 14:25.825
They do. The addresses

14:25.875 --> 14:27.609
of the witnesses who
testified against him.

14:27.659 --> 14:29.289
He's not a threat to anyone!

14:29.326 --> 14:31.743
He's on the run and unarmed.

14:31.854 --> 14:33.386
Do you keep any weapons in the house?

14:33.436 --> 14:34.483
Oh, great.

14:34.533 --> 14:36.825
Now you're going to pin
another crime on him?

14:38.266 --> 14:39.724
Just my old Colt.

14:39.778 --> 14:40.778
Where is it?

14:55.279 --> 14:58.578
Paulson could be after any
one of a half dozen witnesses.

14:58.645 --> 15:01.279
I've never seen a convicted
felon file so many appeals.

15:01.345 --> 15:03.145
It's an abuse of the system.

15:03.212 --> 15:04.526
We're all entitled to our day in court.

15:04.550 --> 15:06.582
Not according to Agent Gibbs.

15:06.634 --> 15:08.712
I've been going over his case files.

15:08.760 --> 15:11.663
He seems to prefer a more biblical

15:11.713 --> 15:13.111
approach to things.

15:13.193 --> 15:13.978
If you ask me,

15:14.028 --> 15:16.178
the agency's better off without him.

15:17.148 --> 15:18.066
Oh.

15:18.145 --> 15:20.240
I like you, Michelle, so
I'm just going to pretend

15:20.290 --> 15:21.670
like you didn't say that.

15:21.701 --> 15:24.056
NCIS is lucky to have Gibbs back.

15:24.123 --> 15:25.731
Except he's not staying.

15:25.756 --> 15:27.047
You do realize...

15:27.097 --> 15:29.835
You can kill me without leaving
any forensic evidence behind?

15:29.859 --> 15:31.481
Yeah, you mentioned that.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.427
Good, then. It's settled.

15:33.498 --> 15:34.858
Gibbs is staying.

15:35.565 --> 15:36.717
He has to.

15:36.845 --> 15:38.021
Right, Gibbs?

15:46.671 --> 15:47.919
What do you got for me, Abby?

15:47.951 --> 15:49.722
Paulson's fingerprints on the gun case

15:49.789 --> 15:51.103
and on Mickey's computer.

15:51.153 --> 15:54.524
And he's also visited over
a dozen People Search sites.

15:54.574 --> 15:55.929
I think he was looking for someone.

15:55.953 --> 15:56.995
Yeah, I got that part.

15:57.045 --> 15:59.225
No names yet, but I'm using the FBI's

15:59.275 --> 16:01.290
mainframe to decrypt the search cache.

16:02.453 --> 16:04.635
Oh. You always did
have really good timing.

16:06.169 --> 16:07.226
Mickey?!

16:07.321 --> 16:09.347
Where the hell is Mickey, you tramp?

16:09.397 --> 16:11.294
Mickey isn't here.

16:11.815 --> 16:13.266
It's Mickey's online playmate.

16:13.316 --> 16:14.917
She keeps tunneling through my firewall.

16:14.967 --> 16:16.531
Russell Nash.

16:16.579 --> 16:17.874
Apparently, he's...

16:17.924 --> 16:19.401
The only accomplice Paulson didn't kill.

16:19.425 --> 16:21.610
Yeah, and the one he really should have.

16:21.657 --> 16:23.433
Nash copped a plea and
testified against Paulson.

16:23.457 --> 16:24.590
Paulson got life,

16:24.657 --> 16:27.263
and Nash walked in 18 months.

16:27.313 --> 16:28.797
Skipped out on his parole.

16:28.847 --> 16:30.113
Hasn't been seen since.

16:30.163 --> 16:32.418
Well, if the money was
never found, then maybe

16:32.481 --> 16:33.677
Paulson is looking for Nash

16:33.727 --> 16:34.690
because he thinks Nash has the money.

16:34.738 --> 16:36.132
Or maybe Paulson is looking

16:36.182 --> 16:39.419
for something a little more... biblical.

16:41.858 --> 16:42.510
Thank you.

16:42.560 --> 16:44.151
I'll let Agent Gibbs know immediately.

16:44.199 --> 16:45.540
And I'll see you Saturday.

16:45.590 --> 16:46.778
Okay.

16:48.941 --> 16:50.880
Hey, was the FBI able to
warn all the witnesses?

16:50.912 --> 16:52.199
All except for one.

16:52.263 --> 16:54.297
Is that your third Caf-POW!, McGee?

16:54.917 --> 16:56.824
It's my fourth. How do they look?

16:57.423 --> 16:59.598
Hmm. Maybe you should
switch to blueberries.

16:59.753 --> 17:01.262
Anything good on our tip hotline?

17:01.355 --> 17:02.312
Is there ever?

17:02.351 --> 17:04.637
Half our callers don't
know what a tip is.

17:04.661 --> 17:05.883
Have you spoken to Gibbs yet?

17:05.983 --> 17:07.040
What about?

17:07.071 --> 17:08.419
You're not wondering why he's back?

17:08.443 --> 17:10.104
Help Fornell like he helped you.

17:10.171 --> 17:12.351
Taking a little break, DiNozzo?

17:12.401 --> 17:14.867
Oh, I think you know
exactly what I'm doing,

17:15.001 --> 17:16.734
Agent Gibbs.

17:16.830 --> 17:17.910
Why do you think he's back?

17:17.934 --> 17:20.174
I don't know, but I'm hoping
it's more than just Fornell.

17:20.222 --> 17:23.776
Let's just say I'm getting
sick of the campfires.

17:23.828 --> 17:24.896
Showtime.

17:25.126 --> 17:26.625
Wouldn't let Tony hear you say that.

17:26.659 --> 17:27.882
Say what, Agent McGee?

17:27.932 --> 17:29.491
Yeah, I was just telling
McGee the FBI was able to...

17:29.515 --> 17:32.676
Warn all the witnesses from
Paulson's trial, except for one?

17:32.726 --> 17:34.998
Right! The only one
they couldn't find was...

17:35.048 --> 17:36.329
Russell Nash.

17:40.056 --> 17:42.774
I have much to learn still, Master.

17:43.082 --> 17:44.745
Campfire!

17:47.248 --> 17:48.543
There you go.

17:48.593 --> 17:50.008
Sort of a new thing that I like to do.

17:50.032 --> 17:52.192
I find it focuses the
group better than just, uh,

17:52.253 --> 17:54.333
you know, shouting across the bullpen.

17:56.244 --> 17:57.976
Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

17:58.867 --> 18:01.024
Let's focus on Russell Nash.

18:01.394 --> 18:02.249
The inside man.

18:02.299 --> 18:03.749
Worked for the bank that
Paulson knocked over.

18:03.773 --> 18:04.992
Our only missing witness.

18:05.042 --> 18:05.847
According to Abby,

18:05.897 --> 18:07.276
he's the one Paulson's after.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.130
- We find Nash...
- We find Paulson.

18:10.873 --> 18:12.141
Campfire over.

18:12.284 --> 18:13.997
And the last question.

18:14.038 --> 18:15.699
"In your own words, the difference

18:15.749 --> 18:17.764
between ethics and morals."

18:17.828 --> 18:20.713
Well, the ethical man knows
he shouldn't cheat on his wife,

18:20.760 --> 18:24.654
whereas the moral man actually wouldn't.

18:24.988 --> 18:27.173
You're going to ace
your oral exams, Doctor.

18:27.873 --> 18:28.799
Going back to school?

18:28.849 --> 18:29.682
I never stopped.

18:29.744 --> 18:32.526
The doctor's getting a
degree in Forensic Psychology.

18:32.589 --> 18:33.992
Yes, and with it, I'll be able to add

18:34.016 --> 18:37.067
the Psychological Autopsy to my arsenal.

18:37.147 --> 18:39.042
I'll not only be able
to uncover the hows

18:39.090 --> 18:44.244
of our patient's demise,
but the whys, as well.

18:44.294 --> 18:48.841
I mean, what motivates us
can be a very tricky thing.

18:49.445 --> 18:50.788
I was wondering when you were going

18:50.812 --> 18:52.524
to come down and see me.

18:52.620 --> 18:53.891
I've been busy.

18:54.050 --> 18:55.687
Or avoiding me.

18:56.824 --> 18:58.318
I wonder

18:58.381 --> 19:00.300
why that could be.

19:00.332 --> 19:01.445
I'm not staying.

19:01.508 --> 19:02.686
Oh, I didn't think you were.

19:02.736 --> 19:05.997
I'm aware that when Leroy
Jethro Gibbs makes up his mind,

19:06.047 --> 19:07.822
his mind's made up.

19:08.633 --> 19:09.825
So...

19:11.398 --> 19:12.777
why are you here?

19:12.809 --> 19:14.851
The Paulson case-
how much do you know?

19:14.901 --> 19:18.189
Well, I took the liberty of
examining the M.E.'s reports

19:18.253 --> 19:20.198
on Paulson's two murdered accomplices.

19:20.241 --> 19:21.304
Anything bug you?

19:21.374 --> 19:23.752
It's about as watertight
a case as I've ever seen,

19:23.802 --> 19:25.781
pathologically speaking-why?

19:26.198 --> 19:29.351
Do you suspect foul
play in the foul play?

19:29.398 --> 19:29.962
No.

19:29.986 --> 19:31.482
Yet you're down here asking me

19:31.532 --> 19:33.283
if anything "bugs you" about the case.

19:33.333 --> 19:37.706
Are you getting one of those
famous gut instincts again?

19:37.730 --> 19:40.528
I've already had that, and it
said that Paulson was guilty.

19:40.591 --> 19:43.613
And when Leroy Jethro
Gibbs makes up his mind,

19:43.663 --> 19:45.065
his mind's made up.

19:45.563 --> 19:48.065
Too bad for Petty Officer Paulson.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.147
Let's hope things work out

19:50.179 --> 19:52.452
better for you in Mexico.

20:00.344 --> 20:01.082
Uh-huh.

20:01.132 --> 20:02.323
No word on the Russell Nash.

20:02.373 --> 20:04.831
BOLO, but we got something
off the tip hotline on Paulson.

20:04.877 --> 20:06.628
What? Paulson.

20:07.605 --> 20:08.835
Hey, Jethro.

20:08.939 --> 20:10.793
Hey, you got a tip hotline to find me,

20:10.843 --> 20:14.165
but nothing on my
original case. Not cool.

20:14.482 --> 20:16.576
Gonna have to do something about that.

20:17.371 --> 20:18.206
But for now,

20:18.256 --> 20:20.526
just calling to say thanks for the car.

20:20.555 --> 20:23.637
I left you a token of my
appreciation in return.

20:23.701 --> 20:25.561
I'm sure you'll find it soon.

20:26.604 --> 20:28.747
Called his own tip hotline.

20:29.240 --> 20:30.829
I'm starting to like this guy.

20:30.877 --> 20:33.229
We're getting an address
from the back trace now.

20:33.293 --> 20:34.095
We got it!

20:34.199 --> 20:35.871
It's in the city. 4242...

20:35.936 --> 20:37.450
Adams Boulevard?

20:39.488 --> 20:40.950
You been there before, boss?

20:41.000 --> 20:41.521
Yeah.

20:41.621 --> 20:44.244
That's where Paulson
killed his two accomplices.

20:52.454 --> 20:53.730
Is Agent Gibbs aware

20:53.780 --> 20:55.243
our warrant hasn't
officially come through yet?

20:55.267 --> 20:57.317
Yeah, I think he got it by the
fifth time you told him, Lee.

20:57.341 --> 20:58.381
Got my teams out front.

20:58.507 --> 20:59.816
Any idea what his game is this time?

20:59.840 --> 21:01.040
Not a clue.

21:01.107 --> 21:01.743
Okay, McGee, Ziva,

21:01.793 --> 21:02.793
fire escape, Lee...

21:02.889 --> 21:04.334
Watch the cars.

21:10.326 --> 21:11.751
Get back.

21:14.777 --> 21:16.531
I imagine you'd rather
be enjoying a nice drink

21:16.555 --> 21:17.677
in a cantina right about now.

21:17.701 --> 21:18.981
The thought had crossed my mind.

21:19.007 --> 21:20.252
Mine, too.

21:22.107 --> 21:24.790
Any bets on Paulson's
token of appreciation?

21:24.822 --> 21:27.730
Let's hope it's not Russell
Nash's head on a stick.

21:28.509 --> 21:29.907
Federal Agents!

21:48.098 --> 21:50.045
It appears ex-Petty Officer Paulson

21:50.095 --> 21:51.039
is attempting to highlight

21:51.089 --> 21:52.630
the discrepancies in this crime scene.

21:52.689 --> 21:54.718
Yeah. Picked up on that.

21:55.974 --> 21:57.165
For a guilty man, he's unusually

21:57.189 --> 21:59.769
intent on trying to
convince us of his innocence.

21:59.844 --> 22:01.628
Picked up on that, too.

22:03.043 --> 22:04.402
No one heard the shooting?

22:04.443 --> 22:06.055
Well, it's not exactly

22:06.087 --> 22:08.328
a Neighborhood Watch kind of place.

22:09.909 --> 22:11.799
And the fact that
Paulson's DNA was found

22:11.849 --> 22:13.416
under this victim's fingernails,

22:13.477 --> 22:15.153
but there was no other
sign of a struggle?

22:15.203 --> 22:17.975
Mm-hmm. See that about a
quarter of the time, Ziva.

22:22.493 --> 22:24.337
Why isn't he running?

22:24.610 --> 22:26.117
That's a good question.

22:26.689 --> 22:27.978
What's that gut of yours say?

22:28.028 --> 22:29.645
Four years ago? That Paulson was guilty.

22:29.909 --> 22:31.164
Didn't mean four years ago.

22:31.214 --> 22:32.443
Paulson isn't after Nash

22:32.510 --> 22:33.586
for the money from the bank job.

22:33.610 --> 22:34.902
He's after Nash because Nash

22:34.926 --> 22:36.569
is the one man who can exonerate him.

22:36.619 --> 22:39.452
So was your gut wrong four years ago,

22:39.610 --> 22:41.034
or is it wrong now?

22:41.176 --> 22:43.445
Our job is not to reopen Paulson's case.

22:43.509 --> 22:44.892
Just catch him.

22:45.009 --> 22:47.304
Paulson's already
reopened his case, Ziva.

22:47.383 --> 22:49.176
Doesn't matter what our job is,

22:49.243 --> 22:51.055
if we want to figure out his next move.

22:51.343 --> 22:53.056
Now we're have to reopen it, too.

22:53.909 --> 22:54.912
Smart kid.

22:59.744 --> 23:02.202
The public defender
who represented Paulson

23:02.226 --> 23:03.479
is out on maternity leave.

23:03.524 --> 23:05.478
- Prosecutor?
- Naval reservist.

23:05.528 --> 23:07.053
Deployed to Iraq two years ago.

23:07.109 --> 23:08.931
Killed by an IED last month.

23:08.981 --> 23:11.603
Unless we find someone
familiar with the Paulson case,

23:11.653 --> 23:13.963
it'll take us days just
to catch up to speed,

23:14.011 --> 23:16.554
much less anticipate
Paulson's next move.

23:16.713 --> 23:17.615
Relax.

23:17.678 --> 23:19.378
Gibbs brought in Mickey Stokes.

23:19.410 --> 23:21.556
No one knows Paulson better than him.

23:21.810 --> 23:23.073
Is he even a lawyer?

23:23.123 --> 23:24.564
Well, we can't all be lawyers,

23:24.677 --> 23:25.744
Agent Lee.

23:26.210 --> 23:27.316
So what changed your mind

23:27.366 --> 23:28.569
about my boy?

23:28.617 --> 23:30.933
Great Oz finally give you guys a heart?

23:30.983 --> 23:32.177
Who said I've changed my mind?

23:32.201 --> 23:34.283
Ah, definitely wasn't a brain.

23:34.343 --> 23:37.144
If Paulson was framed,
we need to find out how.

23:37.220 --> 23:38.692
Maybe it was a brain.

23:38.943 --> 23:40.955
Either way, thank you.

23:41.055 --> 23:43.554
I've waited a long time
for someone to listen.

23:43.633 --> 23:45.191
Don't thank me just yet.

23:45.413 --> 23:46.661
Jury had two weeks,

23:46.711 --> 23:48.568
they didn't buy that Paulson was framed.

23:48.810 --> 23:49.998
You have one day

23:50.026 --> 23:52.293
to convince our forensic
scientist otherwise.

23:52.335 --> 23:54.099
You must be Mickey.

23:54.510 --> 23:55.782
Well... I'll be

23:55.832 --> 23:57.906
whoever you want me to be.

23:58.017 --> 24:00.179
Mickey will do just fine.

24:00.703 --> 24:02.284
I like your outfit.

24:02.316 --> 24:03.316
Thank you.

24:03.993 --> 24:06.054
My dog has a collar like that.

24:07.696 --> 24:09.362
So, for the sake of argument, let's say

24:09.412 --> 24:11.335
that Derrick Paulson was framed.

24:11.385 --> 24:13.839
That makes Russell
Nash your prime suspect.

24:13.864 --> 24:15.858
Exactly, Director.

24:16.559 --> 24:17.924
Hey, Gibbs.

24:18.226 --> 24:19.848
Why don't you come on over and join us

24:19.898 --> 24:21.651
for a little campfire?

24:26.093 --> 24:26.700
Where's he going?

24:26.744 --> 24:28.277
Basement. Fornell.

24:28.333 --> 24:29.978
- Whiskey.
- Not tonight.

24:30.076 --> 24:32.426
His real estate agent's
fumigating his house.

24:32.477 --> 24:35.255
Apparently, Gibbs got termites.

24:35.541 --> 24:36.943
I'd offer you the sofa,

24:36.980 --> 24:39.165
but when I told Emily
you were staying over,

24:39.215 --> 24:40.906
she insisted you take her room.

24:41.006 --> 24:45.141
Even said you can sleep with
her Raspberry Rumtart doll.

24:50.577 --> 24:51.703
Daddy, watch.

24:51.876 --> 24:53.949
You may now kiss the bride.

24:57.813 --> 25:00.436
So, it was four wives.

25:00.777 --> 25:02.386
Unless there's anything
else you want to tell me.

25:02.410 --> 25:04.245
Something you want to know, Tobias?

25:11.883 --> 25:13.719
You had a family, Jethro.

25:13.767 --> 25:16.262
I know you like to play it
close to the vest, but...

25:16.976 --> 25:18.730
Hell, I was married to your second wife.

25:18.780 --> 25:20.710
I tried to warn you. I know, I know.

25:20.777 --> 25:21.833
I didn't listen.

25:21.865 --> 25:23.974
If I did, I might still have a house

25:24.024 --> 25:25.850
with a guest bedroom for you.

25:33.243 --> 25:35.355
I know it's not our usual stuff.

25:39.377 --> 25:40.894
So we screwed up?

25:42.093 --> 25:43.715
Let's wait and see what Abby says.

25:43.744 --> 25:45.610
We screwed up. Big time.

25:46.469 --> 25:47.883
I'm sure it wasn't the first time,

25:47.931 --> 25:49.489
and I know it's not gonna be the last.

25:50.987 --> 25:52.179
My last.

25:53.893 --> 25:55.787
Least we can still make it right.

25:59.610 --> 26:02.764
If Russell Nash did frame Paulson,

26:02.814 --> 26:05.303
he's not going to come
clean when Paulson finds him.

26:05.443 --> 26:06.691
He's going to kill Paulson.

26:07.143 --> 26:08.164
I know it.

26:08.371 --> 26:10.291
I said we screwed up, didn't I?

26:13.230 --> 26:15.201
It's funny how things work out.

26:15.543 --> 26:17.108
When I was a kid,

26:18.009 --> 26:20.798
all I ever thought about
was being an FBI Agent.

26:20.909 --> 26:22.165
Now...

26:22.844 --> 26:25.749
not a day goes by I don't
think about being a kid.

26:26.343 --> 26:27.618
I don't pay it much attention.

26:28.483 --> 26:29.858
The way I figure it,

26:29.893 --> 26:32.226
anyone who doesn't
want to quit this job...

26:32.465 --> 26:34.181
isn't doing it right.

26:35.667 --> 26:37.786
My mother'll kill me if she sees this.

26:37.836 --> 26:40.577
It's a henna tattoo; It'll
come off in a few days.

26:40.643 --> 26:41.643
Looks good.

26:41.777 --> 26:43.671
Of course, I love a girl with tattoos.

26:43.744 --> 26:44.550
I've noticed.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.159
Can we just get this over with?

26:46.209 --> 26:47.496
Go over there.

26:49.419 --> 26:53.146
Could you move around a bit?

26:54.954 --> 26:57.672
All right, how about
just walk back and forth?

26:58.133 --> 27:00.443
Try a... a little attitude!

27:00.509 --> 27:02.009
A little attitude.

27:02.059 --> 27:03.588
You know, swing the hips, you know.

27:03.638 --> 27:05.774
Hey, give us something to dance to.

27:05.798 --> 27:06.879
Kick it up.

27:07.177 --> 27:09.211
Swing the pelvis, look.

27:09.386 --> 27:11.857
Like you're walking down the stage.

27:11.907 --> 27:13.410
Come on, get the shoulders going...

27:13.477 --> 27:14.862
Stop it.

27:17.671 --> 27:19.443
Huh, the shoulders?

27:19.510 --> 27:21.777
Okay. Come on, do it.

27:21.843 --> 27:23.893
Okay, only 'cause it's you, Mickey.

27:25.643 --> 27:27.237
Yeah.

27:36.009 --> 27:37.822
This is not what it looks like.

27:37.876 --> 27:39.643
Abby, please turn the music off.

27:39.710 --> 27:40.954
Now, please, off.

27:41.033 --> 27:42.908
I'm so...

27:43.610 --> 27:45.076
This is what we were doing, sir:

27:45.143 --> 27:46.246
We were working on the Pauls-

27:46.270 --> 27:47.319
We were...

27:47.478 --> 27:49.720
We were establishing a baseline

27:49.744 --> 27:52.159
of henna ink's optical reflectivity.

27:52.210 --> 27:53.526
You want to know why?

27:54.114 --> 27:56.532
Glad you asked. We're
trying to figure out

27:56.582 --> 27:58.310
if the evidence was
planted to frame Paulson.

27:58.334 --> 28:00.117
Yeah, like the DNA they found.

28:00.167 --> 28:03.146
That could easily have
come from some... uh...

28:03.400 --> 28:05.627
Why is he looking at me like that?

28:06.613 --> 28:08.679
He's kind of a bottom line guy.

28:08.726 --> 28:10.343
Bottom line: The more Mickey

28:10.410 --> 28:12.071
told us, the guiltier Paulson looked.

28:12.112 --> 28:14.917
Until we looked at
video from the bank job.

28:14.965 --> 28:17.605
Paulson was identified
by his custom tattoo.

28:17.699 --> 28:19.223
One of a kind,

28:19.273 --> 28:21.509
unique as a fingerprint and pretty cool.

28:21.543 --> 28:22.818
With the corroborating evidence,

28:22.842 --> 28:24.677
it was more than enough
for a jury to convict.

28:24.744 --> 28:25.999
You think it's a copy?

28:26.047 --> 28:27.486
That's why we were taking the pictures.

28:27.510 --> 28:28.995
It looks like a henna tattoo.

28:29.027 --> 28:31.865
But if Russell Nash had a
copy made to frame Paulson...

28:31.915 --> 28:34.294
- There'd be a color-mismatch.
- Can you prove it?

28:34.344 --> 28:35.301
Yeah, but...

28:35.360 --> 28:36.496
I'm gonna have to see Paulson's

28:36.520 --> 28:37.902
original tattoo for the test.

28:37.952 --> 28:39.553
He'll never go for that.

28:39.585 --> 28:41.370
Not unless he believes you're serious

28:41.420 --> 28:42.971
about reopening his case.

28:43.021 --> 28:44.397
And he won't believe that

28:44.444 --> 28:47.467
until you haul in that
bastard, Russell Nash.

28:47.517 --> 28:48.319
We're working on it.

28:48.382 --> 28:49.751
We've got a lead on that, too.

28:49.793 --> 28:51.425
The FBI has been doing background checks

28:51.475 --> 28:53.273
on all of Nash's buddies.

28:53.957 --> 28:55.755
Meet Gary Silverstin.

28:55.805 --> 28:57.317
Russell Nash's old roommate.

28:57.367 --> 28:59.333
He used to work at a tattoo shop.

28:59.397 --> 29:01.685
It could just be a coincidence...

29:02.685 --> 29:04.372
Wow, he hates me.

29:04.522 --> 29:05.909
No, no, no, no, no, no.

29:05.976 --> 29:06.865
Careful, Gary.

29:06.915 --> 29:08.509
I told you, stand five steps back.

29:08.602 --> 29:10.081
Insurance reasons.

29:10.143 --> 29:12.195
You can get insurance to be a flipper?

29:12.544 --> 29:14.419
Human Directional.

29:14.443 --> 29:15.669
You're a sign, Gary.

29:15.719 --> 29:16.844
Yeah, I'm the future.

29:16.909 --> 29:17.523
You know what, man?

29:17.573 --> 29:19.318
I brought in an extra ten grand

29:19.368 --> 29:20.804
last month to Broadbus Burger.

29:20.854 --> 29:23.559
In a couple years, this'll
probably be an Olympic sport.

29:23.610 --> 29:26.591
You think you could be happy
flipping a sign all day?

29:26.734 --> 29:27.803
I don't know.

29:27.878 --> 29:29.610
I think you'd get bored.

29:29.943 --> 29:31.876
You've got to stop
doing that-stop it!

29:31.943 --> 29:33.085
Am I under arrest?

29:33.143 --> 29:35.269
No. Then, no, man.

29:35.293 --> 29:36.668
I work by the hour.

29:38.575 --> 29:40.117
Gary...

29:40.761 --> 29:43.145
I can think of a lot
of ways to arrest you.

29:43.176 --> 29:44.289
A lot of 'em.

29:44.988 --> 29:46.323
All right, well, what
else is there to say?

29:46.347 --> 29:47.879
Yeah, I worked at a tat shop.

29:47.929 --> 29:49.047
Yes, I lived with Nash.

29:49.097 --> 29:50.467
No, I don't know where he is.

29:50.517 --> 29:52.077
And I don't know nothing
about no bank robbery.

29:52.101 --> 29:53.865
That all went down after he moved out.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.065
All right?

29:55.185 --> 29:56.559
Sorry, dude.

29:58.641 --> 30:00.771
Good luck in Beijing in '08, Gary.

30:04.976 --> 30:06.648
I'm just saying, a man of your drive

30:06.698 --> 30:08.025
and ambition needs a certain kind of...

30:08.049 --> 30:09.350
I'm not staying, Ziva.

30:09.410 --> 30:11.050
That obvious?

30:15.451 --> 30:17.069
So, how'd it go?

30:17.119 --> 30:18.948
I'll tell you in 20 seconds.

30:19.750 --> 30:21.088
He's already making a call.

30:21.188 --> 30:22.334
Putting it on speaker.

30:22.384 --> 30:23.515
NASH Hey, you got Nash.

30:23.615 --> 30:25.091
Leave me a message after the beep.

30:25.191 --> 30:26.569
I'd say that went well.

30:26.593 --> 30:28.247
Hey, Nash, it's Gary S.

30:28.297 --> 30:30.333
Now I know you told me to
call you here never, man,

30:30.383 --> 30:31.535
but there was some feds here

30:31.585 --> 30:33.896
and they were asking
questions about that tat.

30:33.928 --> 30:35.003
It's a Baltimore prefix.

30:35.040 --> 30:38.003
At least I think they were
Feds. I never heard of no N-C-

30:38.053 --> 30:39.677
C- I-S... Got it.

30:39.744 --> 30:40.944
82 West Pratt Street,

30:40.994 --> 30:42.054
apartment 12.

30:42.101 --> 30:44.199
I know it-40
miles north of here.

30:45.801 --> 30:47.465
Not bad for rush hour.

30:47.529 --> 30:50.374
Only you could make it 40
miles in 30 minutes, Boss.

30:50.632 --> 30:51.916
Something's wrong.

30:52.304 --> 30:53.656
Maybe Paulson beat us here

30:53.700 --> 30:55.140
and found out the hard way that Nash

30:55.177 --> 30:57.085
wasn't willing to change his testimony.

30:57.578 --> 30:59.624
Stay right where you
are; Don't come closer.

30:59.744 --> 31:00.820
Yes, all right.

31:07.853 --> 31:08.853
It's Nash.

31:23.464 --> 31:26.309
The end is never pleasant.

31:26.420 --> 31:29.003
For this young man, doubly so.

31:29.353 --> 31:31.371
At least he had a great
view on the way down.

31:31.419 --> 31:32.825
I doubt that he enjoyed it,

31:32.925 --> 31:34.726
seeing that his jaw was broken

31:34.768 --> 31:36.425
as well as six of his fingers

31:36.449 --> 31:38.690
and his knee.

31:38.722 --> 31:41.257
And all this before he fell.

31:41.607 --> 31:42.704
Killer beat him first.

31:42.767 --> 31:44.655
More like he was interrogated.

31:44.686 --> 31:46.402
This damage is too methodical,

31:46.469 --> 31:48.302
too calculated to be a simple beating.

31:48.369 --> 31:50.469
Whoever did this was after information.

31:50.535 --> 31:52.602
And when he got it...

31:52.669 --> 31:55.518
he repaid his victim with these.

31:55.582 --> 31:57.704
Guess we can rule out suicide.

31:57.783 --> 31:59.480
Yes, unless Mr. Nash

31:59.543 --> 32:01.558
was able to shoot himself in the back

32:01.606 --> 32:03.672
three times in a row.

32:03.815 --> 32:06.851
Ugh... do we have to do this now?

32:06.882 --> 32:08.972
The slugs are Winchester hollowpoints.

32:09.020 --> 32:11.194
Winchester hollowpoints.

32:11.448 --> 32:13.053
Hey, Gibbs. Gibbs.

32:13.180 --> 32:13.939
Cool, huh?

32:14.003 --> 32:16.768
They were fired from the
Colt that Baltimore P.D.

32:16.832 --> 32:17.832
found near the scene.

32:17.865 --> 32:19.788
Abs, did you run the serial number?

32:19.812 --> 32:23.210
It's the same gun that Paulson
took from Mickey Stokes' house.

32:23.241 --> 32:25.037
He tried to wipe it, but I found

32:25.068 --> 32:26.736
a partial print.

32:26.801 --> 32:29.469
So the gentleman who asked
us to prove his innocence...

32:29.535 --> 32:32.229
just killed the one man
who could exonerate him.

32:32.277 --> 32:33.978
Nash didn't frame
Paulson-they were partners

32:34.002 --> 32:35.802
until Nash double-crossed him.

32:35.849 --> 32:38.941
Our ex-Petty Officer didn't
want to clear himself,

32:39.004 --> 32:40.551
he was looking for the money.

32:40.594 --> 32:43.866
And he used us to take
him straight to the bank.

32:43.916 --> 32:45.116
Smart kid.

32:45.179 --> 32:46.804
But if your gut says Paulson's innocent,

32:46.854 --> 32:48.501
then maybe we're missing something.

32:48.569 --> 32:51.052
The only thing that
I am missing right now

32:51.100 --> 32:53.674
is happy hour at Carlos' Cantina.

33:24.053 --> 33:25.738
But you're Security, right?

33:25.801 --> 33:27.335
Don't let Gibbs leave the building.

33:27.402 --> 33:28.569
I already told you why, Tom!

33:28.636 --> 33:29.968
Abby. Never mind. False alarm.

33:30.035 --> 33:31.302
Gibbs, oh, my God.

33:31.369 --> 33:32.901
I was so sure that you'd be halfway

33:32.968 --> 33:34.102
to Mexico by now.

33:34.168 --> 33:35.569
Sorry, you're a flight risk. Abby!

33:35.636 --> 33:37.402
We're going to figure
this case out, Gibbs.

33:37.469 --> 33:39.093
We always do!

33:41.151 --> 33:42.025
You already figured it out.

33:42.073 --> 33:43.646
No, but you're going to.

33:43.710 --> 33:45.618
I want to know how Paulson knows.

33:45.668 --> 33:47.517
Knows what? Everything.

33:47.596 --> 33:49.662
Everything that we seem to.

33:52.669 --> 33:54.935
Russell Nash hid the money
from the bank job somewhere.

33:55.002 --> 33:56.402
Paulson gets to it before us...

33:56.469 --> 33:57.402
He's gone for good.

33:57.469 --> 33:58.402
So where is it?

33:58.469 --> 34:00.168
Nash was using an assumed name.

34:00.235 --> 34:02.167
All transactions were cash-only.

34:02.215 --> 34:03.002
Money's not in a bank.

34:03.068 --> 34:04.901
Storage, maybe. A third

34:04.968 --> 34:06.135
party could be holding it.

34:06.202 --> 34:07.378
I'll look at properties under an alias.

34:07.402 --> 34:09.502
Maybe he hid the money
in a mattress somewhere.

34:09.947 --> 34:11.759
Campfire over.

34:12.681 --> 34:14.147
Where's Gibbs? I don't know.

34:14.179 --> 34:15.179
Anything wrong? Uh, well,

34:15.212 --> 34:18.033
actually, yeah, there's
quite a lot wrong, Ziva.

34:18.083 --> 34:19.379
Aside from McGee's teeth,

34:19.429 --> 34:21.235
we have a dead man
who shouldn't be dead,

34:21.302 --> 34:22.478
an innocent man who
isn't really innocent

34:22.502 --> 34:24.512
and a trail that's about to run cold

34:24.562 --> 34:26.835
because our perp has managed
to stay one step ahead of us

34:26.900 --> 34:28.849
since this whole thing started!

34:28.913 --> 34:30.666
You're just noticing that now, DiNozzo?

34:30.716 --> 34:32.440
Oh, no, it's kind of been a theme.

34:35.085 --> 34:36.995
Careful that's, um, easy to...

34:39.072 --> 34:40.233
break.

34:42.395 --> 34:44.579
It's a shortwave RF bug.

34:44.629 --> 34:45.369
Paulson probably

34:45.435 --> 34:47.866
planted it in your Dictaphone
when he stole your car.

34:47.929 --> 34:50.091
And I've been burning campfires to CD.

34:50.139 --> 34:52.784
The Dictaphone has been in my
lab pretty much the entire day.

34:52.835 --> 34:55.774
At least now we know how Paulson
tracked down Russell Nash.

34:55.821 --> 34:56.791
There's the little bugger.

34:56.833 --> 34:57.469
Can you backtrack it, Abs?

34:57.535 --> 34:59.111
It's impossible without
a private cipher.

34:59.135 --> 35:02.886
But... I think I know
where we can get one.

35:05.056 --> 35:07.801
Paulson's crew bugged the bank's
general manager for two weeks

35:07.868 --> 35:11.056
before the robbery-it was a
custom job, just like this one.

35:11.135 --> 35:12.002
The cops interviewed the bug-maker.

35:12.068 --> 35:14.028
Cleared him of any involvement.

35:14.091 --> 35:19.631
I would bet a Caf-POW! That
this came from the same guy.

35:19.980 --> 35:21.220
How can you tell?

35:22.587 --> 35:24.073
He signed his name.

35:25.046 --> 35:25.801
"It is a crime for any person

35:25.868 --> 35:27.402
"acting under color of the law

35:27.469 --> 35:29.975
to deprive any citizen
of their legal rights."

35:30.008 --> 35:31.787
Title Eighteen, U.S. Code.

35:31.834 --> 35:34.060
No one is depriving you of your rights.

35:34.091 --> 35:36.777
We're simply asking for a
copy of the cipher you made.

35:36.841 --> 35:38.135
"No one shall be compelled

35:38.202 --> 35:40.858
in any criminal case to be
a witness against himself."

35:40.890 --> 35:42.456
That'd be the Fifth Amendment.

35:42.519 --> 35:44.085
And no one has accused
you of a crime, either.

35:44.109 --> 35:46.397
Then why'd your goon
confiscate my files?

35:46.445 --> 35:47.302
Goon?!

35:47.375 --> 35:48.975
Told you to stop
hunching your shoulders.

35:49.002 --> 35:51.046
How do you know he
wasn't talking about you?

35:51.094 --> 35:52.035
It's called a mirror, McGee.

35:52.102 --> 35:55.791
No, I said every exit,
not every other exit.

35:55.934 --> 35:58.445
For same the reason you
don't floss every other tooth.

35:58.509 --> 36:00.209
Where's that cipher, DiNozzo?

36:00.756 --> 36:02.490
We hit a little snafu, boss.

36:02.649 --> 36:03.512
Gibbs.

36:03.562 --> 36:05.569
The federal code also states Yeah.

36:05.713 --> 36:07.254
That not only have the right

36:07.302 --> 36:09.168
to remain silent, but to withhold

36:09.235 --> 36:10.528
any information I see fit.

36:10.552 --> 36:11.777
If this keeps up, we may be forced

36:11.801 --> 36:14.176
to unleash Agent Lee.

36:20.411 --> 36:22.235
- Now, this should be quick.
- Better be.

36:22.302 --> 36:25.520
We got a fugitive on the
run with a pretty big lead.

36:26.197 --> 36:27.519
The Fugitive...

36:27.599 --> 36:29.264
You can stare at me all day, G-man.

36:29.343 --> 36:30.408
I ain't talking.

36:30.448 --> 36:31.870
You got something to hide?

36:31.934 --> 36:34.036
What, so I refuse to talk
and that means I'm guilty?

36:34.060 --> 36:36.868
You ever heard of
Miranda v.Arizona, 1966?

36:36.935 --> 36:38.211
And here, all this time, how could

36:38.235 --> 36:40.763
I have missed it? It's that simple.

36:41.542 --> 36:42.231
Missed what?

36:42.281 --> 36:44.266
Gibbs is clearly Tommy Lee Jones.

36:44.329 --> 36:45.895
Right, I mean there's no argument there.

36:45.919 --> 36:48.811
Which makes me Joey Pants;
Initially, I was a little...

36:48.897 --> 36:49.860
What happened?

36:49.892 --> 36:53.019
We've been avoiding the word
fugitive for the last two days.

36:53.051 --> 36:55.316
He made the connection himself. Oh.

36:55.348 --> 36:56.929
The bottom line, Eyeballs,

36:56.953 --> 36:59.846
I run a lawfully licensed spy shop.

36:59.878 --> 37:02.399
I'm not responsible for
what my clientele does

37:02.444 --> 37:03.180
with my product.

37:03.230 --> 37:05.996
I don't have to answer any more

37:06.102 --> 37:09.036
of your questions, no
matter what you say.

37:19.873 --> 37:21.837
I got this little girl...

37:23.990 --> 37:26.247
who wants to go home to her dad.

37:26.561 --> 37:29.251
And that's not going to
happen without your help.

37:34.334 --> 37:35.334
So...

37:39.086 --> 37:40.389
please.

37:41.880 --> 37:42.972
Did Gibbs just say...?

37:43.072 --> 37:44.072
Mm-hmm.

37:49.184 --> 37:53.026
What-What did you, uh, what'd
you want to know, again?

37:56.978 --> 37:59.139
Signal's strong, no movement.

37:59.622 --> 38:00.888
Got eyes on the target, Ziva?

38:00.926 --> 38:03.224
I did; Suspect's in the
house and he's not alone.

38:03.275 --> 38:04.394
You sure?

38:04.546 --> 38:06.021
I heard Paulson's voice.

38:16.239 --> 38:19.411
Let me give you some more
money, in case you need it.

38:19.462 --> 38:20.215
I won't.

38:20.263 --> 38:21.331
In position, boss.

38:22.402 --> 38:24.529
Then here, take this.

38:24.569 --> 38:25.602
Gun. Move, move.

38:25.669 --> 38:26.835
Please, just take it.

38:28.772 --> 38:29.772
Hold it!

38:30.055 --> 38:31.055
Hold it!

38:35.491 --> 38:37.724
Don't do it, Derrick; We will shoot you.

38:42.570 --> 38:46.175
Tony, McGee, put your weapons down.

38:50.902 --> 38:52.288
I was wrong.

38:53.712 --> 38:56.083
I know you're innocent, Petty Officer.

39:00.135 --> 39:01.531
But you're not, Mickey.

39:01.556 --> 39:02.396
DiNozzo.

39:02.421 --> 39:04.378
You're under arrest for
the murders of Russell Nash,

39:04.402 --> 39:07.219
his two accomplices in the
Greater Virginia Bank robbery.

39:07.269 --> 39:08.507
And last but not least

39:08.557 --> 39:10.548
the Greater Virginia Bank robbery.

39:10.598 --> 39:12.322
Is your porch light on?

39:12.372 --> 39:14.905
First, you wrongly
accuse Derrick and now me.

39:14.935 --> 39:16.570
We also found the bug you planted

39:16.620 --> 39:18.371
in our forensic tech's lab.

39:18.421 --> 39:20.494
We were almost as
surprised as you look now,

39:20.544 --> 39:21.784
when the guy you bought it from

39:21.822 --> 39:24.716
pointed you out in that
photo, instead of Paulson.

39:25.002 --> 39:27.402
This is ridiculous.

39:27.870 --> 39:29.768
Do I look like I got five million bucks

39:29.835 --> 39:32.210
laying around?!

39:32.274 --> 39:34.014
If he set me up, where's the money?

39:34.920 --> 39:36.600
They don't know what
they're talkin' about.

39:36.844 --> 39:38.067
It's here.

39:39.378 --> 39:41.143
It's been here the whole time.

39:41.763 --> 39:43.908
It's a Rosewood Bureau Plat desk,

39:44.463 --> 39:46.350
19th century. That's 38 thousand dollars.

39:47.057 --> 39:48.682
First edition of Huckleberry Finn

39:48.706 --> 39:49.787
20,000 dollars.

39:50.412 --> 39:54.461
Looks like in the bedroom, You've
got a Chipendale-Mahogany case clock.

39:55.668 --> 39:56.668
That's six fingers easy!

39:57.506 --> 39:59.826
Mcgee, you don't collect all
these stuff on a Navy pension.

40:00.212 --> 40:01.212
Wow! Wow!

40:02.811 --> 40:03.811
Agent Gibbs.

40:04.201 --> 40:06.001
Don't talk to me, I
think he should shoot you.

40:12.625 --> 40:13.905
Except he's never been a killer.

40:18.124 --> 40:19.724
And I don't think
you're gonna start now.

40:27.831 --> 40:31.079
And miss his trial? Not for the world...

40:32.974 --> 40:34.652
You're a real piece of work, McGee.

40:41.930 --> 40:42.930
Antiques roadshow.

40:49.012 --> 40:53.564
I just came by to tell you that Derrick
Pauleson has been cleared of all charges.

40:55.430 --> 40:57.310
- You saved that boy's life.
- Yeah boss I were.

40:58.834 --> 40:59.986
Don't sell yourself short.

41:01.525 --> 41:04.404
- Or is it too late for that?
- There's supposed to be some sort of peptalk?

41:04.428 --> 41:05.523
Came here to stay Jen?

41:12.936 --> 41:14.147
You don't want me back.

41:16.462 --> 41:17.462
No I don't.

41:17.631 --> 41:20.010
Or you won't be able
to handle me, Director?

41:20.808 --> 41:21.808
No Jethro.

41:23.126 --> 41:24.923
I'm afraid you won't
able to handle yourself.

41:27.785 --> 41:29.370
You've already been in two comas.

41:30.661 --> 41:32.021
You might not come out of a third.

41:33.299 --> 41:34.424
The fact is you're good.

41:35.837 --> 41:36.837
The best.

41:37.591 --> 41:40.600
When you're as good, it's
something as you are when you

41:40.748 --> 41:43.360
can make a difference like
you can you just don't quit.

42:00.434 --> 42:02.524
You know, you used to
be a nice person, McGee.

42:02.929 --> 42:05.158
I think sitting at Tony's desk
is affecting your personality.

42:05.182 --> 42:07.918
For the better, mcGee picked
up a girl all by himself.

42:07.958 --> 42:10.601
- Yeah, at a funeral.
- You didn't tell me that.

42:10.687 --> 42:11.994
Well, you were right.

42:12.529 --> 42:13.906
Because when women are vulnerable,

42:15.180 --> 42:16.180
Get right in there.

42:35.267 --> 42:36.267
What?
