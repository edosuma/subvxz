WEBVTT

00:06.530 --> 00:08.179
Howie, slow down.

00:08.180 --> 00:08.930
I can't.

00:08.932 --> 00:10.932
I'm not allowed to eat
for 12 hours before my surgery,

00:10.934 --> 00:13.468
and I only got two more minutes.

00:16.206 --> 00:18.907
What surgery are you having?

00:18.909 --> 00:20.575
I'm stress eating.

00:20.577 --> 00:24.045
My best friend's getting
a vasectomy tomorrow.

00:24.047 --> 00:27.115
And you're sad you won't be able
to bear his child?

00:28.351 --> 00:29.451
Oh, my goodness.

00:29.453 --> 00:30.952
If it's “vasectomy
gone wrong” videos,

00:30.954 --> 00:32.253
he's seen them all.

00:32.255 --> 00:33.888
Including the one of
the guy who's sitting

00:33.890 --> 00:37.192
on what appears to be a
cantaloupe but is not.

00:38.095 --> 00:40.328
And I'm done.

00:40.330 --> 00:42.163
They're going
to start making

00:42.165 --> 00:44.099
Professor Proton's
science show again.

00:44.615 --> 00:45.670
I thought he passed away.

00:45.671 --> 00:46.202
He did.

00:46.203 --> 00:47.402
He was cremated,
and his remains

00:47.404 --> 00:49.604
were put
in a baking soda volcano.

00:51.174 --> 00:52.640
Don't make jokes.

00:52.642 --> 00:55.276
- He meant a lot to Sheldon.
- Oh, me, too.

00:55.278 --> 00:56.578
I grew up watching his show.

00:56.580 --> 00:58.613
He's one of the reasons
I became a scientist.

00:58.615 --> 01:01.716
Aw. Thought you did it
just to get girls.

01:01.718 --> 01:03.618
Joke's on you. It worked.

01:05.422 --> 01:07.388
Have they found anyone
to replace him?

01:07.390 --> 01:09.324
No, not yet,
and it won't be easy.

01:09.326 --> 01:11.772
Arthur Jeffries was
an accomplished scientist.

01:11.796 --> 01:12.495
Mm.

01:12.496 --> 01:14.929
You know who'd make
a great Professor Proton?

01:14.931 --> 01:17.265
Meryl Streep.

01:18.268 --> 01:19.901
She's not a scientist.

01:19.903 --> 01:21.603
Uh, then explain to me why

01:21.605 --> 01:25.006
she has chemistry
with literally everyone.

01:26.243 --> 01:28.042
It would be nice
if they cast a woman.

01:28.044 --> 01:30.078
Oh, you've already got <i>Doctor</i>
<i>Who</i> and the <i>Ghostbusters.</i>

01:30.080 --> 01:31.880
Leave us something.

01:32.883 --> 01:34.115
Who do you think it should be?

01:34.117 --> 01:36.451
Well, it should be a scientist
I respect.

01:36.453 --> 01:38.887
You know,
someone with a pleasing voice

01:38.889 --> 01:41.523
and symmetrical facial features.

01:41.525 --> 01:43.091
Is he talking
about himself?

01:43.093 --> 01:45.827
If he's talking,
he's talking about himself.

01:47.063 --> 01:49.831
I just know how much Professor
Proton touched me as a child,

01:49.833 --> 01:52.167
and I feel that I owe it to him

01:52.169 --> 01:56.004
to try and touch
as many children as possible.

02:00.610 --> 02:02.610
You should put that
on your audition tape.

02:51.150 --> 02:52.649
Where are you going?

02:52.651 --> 02:53.650
Gift shop.

02:53.652 --> 02:56.053
There is no gift shop.
Sit down.

02:57.757 --> 02:59.490
This was your idea.

02:59.492 --> 03:02.426
So was having sex, and
look where that got us.

03:03.729 --> 03:05.936
This isn't a big deal.
Stop whining.

03:05.937 --> 03:10.173
When you were in labor and
I said that, you kicked me.

03:10.175 --> 03:11.274
Howard Wolowitz?

03:14.713 --> 03:16.079
Want me to go with you?
No.

03:16.081 --> 03:18.348
I'll be fine.
Yeah, we got this.

03:18.350 --> 03:20.550
Sit down!

03:23.855 --> 03:26.055
Wish me luck.

03:26.892 --> 03:29.058
Other way, buster.

03:34.366 --> 03:36.366
Okay, you ready?

03:36.368 --> 03:39.202
Yeah, almost. I'm working
on my facial expressions.

03:39.204 --> 03:41.838
See, uh, I've got
interested. Hmm.

03:41.840 --> 03:45.275
I've got <i>very</i> interested. <i>Hmm.</i>

03:45.277 --> 03:47.444
Enraged.

03:49.881 --> 03:51.714
Why would you be enraged?

03:51.716 --> 03:53.650
Hmm. Better to have it
and not need it

03:53.652 --> 03:55.418
than to need it and not have it.

03:55.420 --> 03:57.353
Okay.

03:59.224 --> 04:00.423
And...

04:00.425 --> 04:01.791
rolling.

04:01.793 --> 04:04.961
Hello. I am theoretical
physicist, Dr. Sheldon Cooper,

04:04.963 --> 04:07.363
auditioning for the role
of Professor Proton.

04:07.365 --> 04:10.033
Now, excuse me
while I get into character.

04:12.070 --> 04:15.872
Hello. I am Professor Proton.

04:15.874 --> 04:17.574
And today,

04:17.576 --> 04:20.108
boys and girls, we're going
to have fun with science.

04:20.111 --> 04:22.579
Did you know you could calculate
the mass of an electron

04:22.581 --> 04:24.581
using household items?
It's true.

04:24.583 --> 04:26.716
All you'll need is a pencil,
some paper,

04:26.718 --> 04:28.751
dry ice, rubbing alcohol,

04:28.753 --> 04:32.856
and a spool of 50-micron-thick
cobalt-60 wire.

04:34.292 --> 04:36.292
And, remember,
don't put it in your mouth,

04:36.294 --> 04:37.760
or instead
of becoming a scientist,

04:37.762 --> 04:40.630
you'll become
wildly radioactive.

04:40.632 --> 04:43.199
Hang on. I have
a question.

04:43.201 --> 04:46.069
Do you have any experiments
that aren't life-threatening?

04:46.071 --> 04:49.305
Come on! That was a perfect
take, and you ruined it.

04:50.075 --> 04:52.575
Oh, look!
Hey, I did need enraged.

04:54.779 --> 04:57.847
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

04:57.849 --> 04:59.649
- Really hurts, huh?
- No.

04:59.651 --> 05:02.619
He's just saying,
“Ow can these prices be so low”.

05:04.089 --> 05:06.623
It's gonna be okay.
A day or two of rest,

05:06.625 --> 05:07.857
and you'll be fine.

05:07.859 --> 05:10.727
You know nothing
about Jewish people.

05:13.665 --> 05:16.332
Um, let me go check on her.

05:17.102 --> 05:20.136
Okay, uh, this is
a bit awkward.

05:20.138 --> 05:22.372
It says here
that I need to check the area

05:22.374 --> 05:24.908
for redness and swelling.

05:26.278 --> 05:28.912
You know what?
It hurts so much, go ahead.

05:31.383 --> 05:33.249
So you see, boys and girls,

05:33.251 --> 05:36.085
H, or helicity,
is the natural variable

05:36.087 --> 05:39.689
to use relativistically
and is defined as S dot P,

05:39.691 --> 05:41.691
divided
by the magnitude of P.

05:41.693 --> 05:44.060
So the next time someone
on the playground tells you

05:44.062 --> 05:46.396
you can only use integral values
for the matrix

05:46.398 --> 05:48.364
that determines the spin
of the antiproton,

05:48.366 --> 05:51.668
you stop being friends with that
kid, 'cause he's going nowhere.

05:54.839 --> 05:58.074
Until next week, this is
Professor Proton saying,

05:58.076 --> 06:00.810
01000010

06:00.812 --> 06:03.279
01111001

06:03.281 --> 06:06.816
01100101.

06:06.818 --> 06:09.586
That's “bye” in ASCII binary,

06:09.588 --> 06:11.220
or good-binary.

06:19.531 --> 06:22.599
So, what do you think?

06:22.601 --> 06:23.900
Well, I
already told him

06:23.902 --> 06:25.401
that I loved it,

06:25.403 --> 06:29.072
but if you found it
confusing or dangerous or...

06:29.074 --> 06:32.709
I don't know... three
to four times too long,

06:32.711 --> 06:35.511
now is the time to share.

06:35.513 --> 06:38.881
I... I don't know
what to say.

06:38.883 --> 06:41.084
Leonard, do you
know what to say?

06:41.086 --> 06:43.886
Sheldon, uh,
I thought it, uh...

06:43.888 --> 06:46.990
It-it looked like
you were having so much fun.

06:47.859 --> 06:49.192
Hey!

06:49.194 --> 06:50.927
That's what you used
to tell me to say to Penny

06:50.929 --> 06:52.195
after one of her
terrible plays.

06:52.197 --> 06:55.498
Hey!
Hey!

06:55.500 --> 06:57.867
Well, what was wrong
with it?

06:57.869 --> 06:59.702
You know, did you find it...

06:59.704 --> 07:02.405
borderline psychotic?

07:02.407 --> 07:03.940
I mean,

07:03.942 --> 07:05.475
I liked that
about it, but...

07:05.477 --> 07:08.211
you guys discuss.

07:08.213 --> 07:10.279
Do you remember
when you were a kid

07:10.281 --> 07:12.482
and you'd watch
Professor Proton?

07:12.484 --> 07:14.050
Of course.
Well,

07:14.052 --> 07:16.853
did he ever make you--
I don't know--

07:16.855 --> 07:19.856
hate science
and the people who do it?

07:19.858 --> 07:21.658
What are you saying?

07:21.660 --> 07:24.127
I-I just think
it would be... better

07:24.129 --> 07:25.928
if your contempt
for children

07:25.930 --> 07:28.431
wasn't so much
in the foreground.

07:28.433 --> 07:30.299
Well, you want me to lie?

07:30.301 --> 07:33.202
Well, it's not
lying-- it's acting.

07:33.204 --> 07:34.437
Sheldon Cooper
may not like kids,

07:34.439 --> 07:36.906
but Professor Proton loves them.

07:36.908 --> 07:39.008
Interesting.

07:39.010 --> 07:40.977
You know, I hadn't
really thought

07:40.979 --> 07:42.245
of it that way.

07:42.247 --> 07:45.682
It-It's similar
to how I'm afraid of dogs,

07:45.684 --> 07:48.518
but my <i>D&D</i> character likes dogs,
you know?

07:49.721 --> 07:52.488
But he's allergic,
so he can't be around them.

07:52.490 --> 07:56.325
Why don't we
have a dog?

07:57.996 --> 07:59.462
Hey, you can
always reshoot it.

07:59.464 --> 08:02.465
Mm, I suppose. And, you know,
maybe I could even get some tips

08:02.467 --> 08:04.801
- from someone who's acted professionally.
- Oh.

08:04.803 --> 08:08.905
Sheldon, obviously,
I'd be happy to help you out.

08:09.741 --> 08:12.442
I don't know what to say.

08:15.280 --> 08:16.412
Hey, Sheldon. What's up?

08:16.414 --> 08:19.182
I need an acting coach.
Oh.

08:19.184 --> 08:21.384
Would you give me
Patrick Stewart's number?

08:21.386 --> 08:23.686
No.

08:23.688 --> 08:25.288
Fine. I guess you can do it.

08:30.195 --> 08:32.895
Bernie?

08:34.131 --> 08:35.565
Where did you get a bell?

08:35.567 --> 08:36.832
App store.

08:39.304 --> 08:41.571
Fun. Let me see.

08:43.475 --> 08:46.008
When you catch me,
you can have it back.

08:46.010 --> 08:48.745
You want to lie down,

08:48.747 --> 08:50.213
watch a movie?

08:50.215 --> 08:52.548
I can't. I got my 16-week
checkup to get to,

08:52.550 --> 08:54.417
and then I'll pick up
some Chinese for dinner.

08:54.419 --> 08:55.718
I'll take Halley with me.

08:55.720 --> 08:58.020
You-you sure
you're not overdoing it?

08:58.022 --> 08:59.155
No, it's fine.
Great.

08:59.157 --> 09:00.423
Then maybe,
instead of Chinese,

09:00.425 --> 09:02.458
fire up the grill
and throw on a couple of steaks?

09:04.496 --> 09:06.929
Kung pao chicken, please.

09:09.934 --> 09:11.701
Oh, boy.
What?

09:11.703 --> 09:13.636
They cast the new
Professor Proton.

09:13.638 --> 09:14.871
Is it Sheldon?

09:14.873 --> 09:16.672
Not exactly.

09:16.674 --> 09:17.974
Wheaton!

09:17.976 --> 09:20.176
It's Wil Wheaton.

09:31.435 --> 09:33.035
Hi.

09:33.037 --> 09:34.437
Hey.

09:34.439 --> 09:36.172
How was the doctor?

09:36.174 --> 09:38.207
Good, but I have some news.

09:38.209 --> 09:40.143
Don't say twins. Don't say
twins. Don't say twins.

09:40.145 --> 09:41.577
Don't say twins.

09:41.579 --> 09:42.879
It's not twins.

09:42.881 --> 09:46.149
Oh. I mean, because
I would have loved them both.

09:46.151 --> 09:48.618
The doctor said
I was overdoing it,

09:48.620 --> 09:51.287
so she put me on bed rest
just to be safe.

09:51.289 --> 09:53.623
Oh, no.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.768
It may not look like it,
but I'm running to you!

10:17.582 --> 10:18.748
Hello, Arthur.

10:18.750 --> 10:21.851
What-what part
of “rest in peace”

10:21.853 --> 10:24.321
don't you understand?

10:27.225 --> 10:29.659
I suppose you're here
because you heard the news?

10:29.661 --> 10:32.262
Sheldon, I'm a figment
of your imagination.

10:32.264 --> 10:35.432
I don't hear news.

10:35.434 --> 10:37.967
You're a grumpy figment.

10:40.205 --> 10:43.039
Look, they're remaking
your show,

10:43.041 --> 10:46.309
and they cast Wil Wheaton
as Professor Proton.

10:46.311 --> 10:49.379
And the worst part is,
he's not even a scientist.

10:49.381 --> 10:51.781
No, the-the worst part is,

10:51.783 --> 10:54.951
I'm sitting on a moist log.

10:57.856 --> 11:01.658
We have to stop this
and protect your legacy.

11:01.660 --> 11:03.126
What legacy?

11:03.128 --> 11:06.563
My-my last two seasons,
I was on Sunday morning

11:06.565 --> 11:07.864
at 5:30.

11:07.866 --> 11:12.669
We-we were beat
by <i>Davey and Goliath.</i>

11:12.671 --> 11:14.938
I can't believe
you don't care.

11:14.940 --> 11:18.074
Believe it.

11:18.076 --> 11:21.044
Well, I care, a lot,

11:21.046 --> 11:25.115
and Wil Wheaton will rue
the day he ever met me.

11:25.951 --> 11:29.519
I think that's true
of most people.

11:33.492 --> 11:35.859
Hi, guys.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.494
Wanted to check in
and see how you two were doing.

11:37.496 --> 11:38.661
We're okay.

11:38.663 --> 11:40.330
Yeah, hanging out
in bed with my wife,

11:40.332 --> 11:44.367
thawing out some frozen peas
in my pants-- living the dream.

11:46.605 --> 11:48.304
Oh, I'll get her.

11:48.306 --> 11:49.739
I thought
Raj was helping you out.

11:49.741 --> 11:50.974
No, he had to work.

11:50.976 --> 11:52.475
Plus, he has a quota

11:52.477 --> 11:54.778
for the amount of Indian
servant jokes he can tolerate,

11:54.780 --> 11:56.413
and, apparently, I filled it.

11:56.415 --> 11:58.982
Well, you're...
I can get the baby.

11:58.984 --> 12:01.217
No, Howie's got it.
He's fine. Right, Howie?

12:01.219 --> 12:03.586
Never better.

12:03.588 --> 12:05.088
Don't be silly.

12:05.090 --> 12:07.157
I'll take the rest of the day
off and watch Halley for you.

12:07.159 --> 12:08.925
Or we can call Stuart.

12:08.927 --> 12:10.460
I'm sure he could
close up the store,

12:10.462 --> 12:12.762
hop on a bus, and
be here in no time.

12:12.764 --> 12:16.032
He does love the bus.

12:16.034 --> 12:17.333
Okay, hang on.

12:17.335 --> 12:19.836
Do you guys not trust me
to take care of your baby?

12:19.838 --> 12:22.172
No.
No!

12:22.174 --> 12:23.640
No.
No.

12:23.642 --> 12:25.375
So I-I guess...

12:25.377 --> 12:27.844
no.

12:27.846 --> 12:30.180
Wow.

12:30.182 --> 12:32.348
It's not that we don't trust
you-- it's just you don't seem

12:32.350 --> 12:34.517
like much of a baby person.
Hey,

12:34.519 --> 12:38.054
hey, hey, I can watch
your stupid baby, okay?

12:39.357 --> 12:41.291
If she cries,
I will pick her up.

12:41.293 --> 12:43.259
If she's hungry,
I'll give her a bottle.

12:43.261 --> 12:46.162
And if she poops,
I'll light some incense.

12:46.164 --> 12:48.631
It would be a big help.

12:48.633 --> 12:50.533
Okay. Thank you.

12:50.535 --> 12:52.435
Trust me, you guys have
nothing to worry about.

12:52.437 --> 12:53.903
You know, back
in Nebraska,

12:53.905 --> 12:55.004
I raised all our baby pigs

12:55.006 --> 12:56.406
right until the day
they were slaughtered.

12:56.408 --> 12:59.809
So, unless your baby's made
of breakfast meat,

12:59.811 --> 13:01.044
she's fine.

13:03.882 --> 13:05.682
Would you ever get
a vasectomy?

13:05.684 --> 13:08.251
Uh, in case you haven't
noticed, Indians aren't

13:08.253 --> 13:10.053
too big on birth control.

13:10.055 --> 13:12.255
There's probably,
like, a million more of us

13:12.257 --> 13:14.424
since we started
this conversation.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.093
Ugh.

13:17.095 --> 13:18.328
You okay?

13:18.330 --> 13:19.462
No.

13:19.464 --> 13:21.798
No, all these comments online
about Wil,

13:21.800 --> 13:24.434
they're nothing but supportive
and kind.

13:25.370 --> 13:26.736
Where's the mean,
snarky Internet

13:26.738 --> 13:29.239
that shows up every time
I get a haircut?

13:30.675 --> 13:32.275
You know that's us, right?

13:34.646 --> 13:38.114
Well, luckily,
I got the number of the company

13:38.116 --> 13:39.516
who's trying to reboot the show,

13:39.518 --> 13:41.851
so I need you all to call and
register your displeasure.

13:41.853 --> 13:43.620
Sheldon, no one's
gonna do that.

13:43.622 --> 13:46.322
Not true. I know of three calls
they've received already:

13:46.324 --> 13:47.724
a-a Southern gentleman,

13:47.726 --> 13:50.560
um, a Cockney chimney sweep,

13:50.562 --> 13:51.694
and, uh,

13:51.696 --> 13:53.363
Mr. T, hmm?

13:53.365 --> 13:55.465
Who-- spoiler alert--

13:55.467 --> 13:58.201
pities the fool
who tries to reboot that show.

13:58.203 --> 14:00.670
What about tiresome lunatic
with a bad haircut?

14:00.672 --> 14:02.005
Has he called yet?

14:02.007 --> 14:03.706
Come on.

14:03.708 --> 14:05.542
How many times have
we banded together

14:05.544 --> 14:07.443
to try to save a
show that we loved?

14:07.445 --> 14:11.114
L-Let's shake things up
and try to kill one.

14:11.116 --> 14:12.982
Isn't the important thing
that there's a show

14:12.984 --> 14:15.051
to get kids excited
about science?

14:15.053 --> 14:17.120
Who cares about kids
and what they like?

14:17.122 --> 14:22.959
This is about me and something
I liked when-when I was a kid.

14:23.662 --> 14:25.128
What if the reboot is great?

14:25.130 --> 14:26.663
That's even worse.

14:26.665 --> 14:29.632
If-if I like it, I'll feel like
I'm being disloyal to Arthur.

14:29.634 --> 14:32.101
He was a mentor
and a friend,

14:32.103 --> 14:34.637
and I won't toss him aside
for some Hollywood pretty boy

14:34.639 --> 14:36.372
like Wil Wheaton.

14:36.374 --> 14:38.775
It's hard to argue with him.

14:38.777 --> 14:40.310
Because he makes no sense? Yeah.

14:42.681 --> 14:44.681
This is actually
kind of nice,

14:44.683 --> 14:48.151
you and me getting to spend
a couple days in bed together.

14:48.153 --> 14:50.787
Yeah. Pretty soon, we're
gonna have two crying babies

14:50.789 --> 14:52.355
in the house.

14:52.357 --> 14:55.425
I'm glad my balls hurt.
It's all their fault.

14:57.262 --> 14:59.462
Well, let's just enjoy
this quiet time

14:59.464 --> 15:00.730
while we still got it.

15:00.732 --> 15:02.832
Yeah.

15:02.834 --> 15:06.069
Yeah, it is
really quiet.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.871
You think
Penny's doing okay?

15:08.873 --> 15:11.641
Penny, everything
all right?!

15:13.845 --> 15:15.411
Hey. All good.

15:15.413 --> 15:18.514
Dipped her pacifier in a little
bourbon, she conked right out.

15:20.385 --> 15:21.985
I hope you're joking.

15:21.987 --> 15:25.455
Of course I'm joking.
I don't share my bourbon.

15:26.992 --> 15:28.291
She's joking.

15:28.293 --> 15:31.628
Definitely.

15:31.630 --> 15:34.263
Probably.

15:37.002 --> 15:39.802
Wil Wheaton. Wil Wheaton.

15:39.804 --> 15:42.005
This is Sheldon, by the way.

15:44.109 --> 15:45.875
Hi, Sheldon.

15:45.877 --> 15:49.412
Here, I found this pizza flyer
in your fence.

15:49.414 --> 15:50.446
Thank you.

15:50.448 --> 15:52.615
Okay, now you owe me a favor.

15:53.518 --> 15:55.818
Turn down the role
of Professor Proton.

15:55.820 --> 15:57.420
I don't think so.

15:57.422 --> 16:01.124
You can't be Professor Proton.
You're not a scientist.

16:01.126 --> 16:02.358
Well, I was never on a starship,

16:02.360 --> 16:04.594
but pretending I was
bought me this house.

16:04.596 --> 16:06.629
And if I'd pretended
a little longer,

16:06.631 --> 16:08.731
it would have a swimming pool.

16:08.733 --> 16:11.234
Some things
shouldn't be rebooted.

16:11.236 --> 16:13.202
Some things were perfect
the way they were.

16:13.204 --> 16:15.805
Like the walled city of York--
it was a delight.

16:15.807 --> 16:18.941
But New York? Blech.

16:18.943 --> 16:22.011
Did you ever consider that maybe
Arthur would be happy to know

16:22.013 --> 16:23.680
that his show has outlived him?

16:23.682 --> 16:24.714
I doubt it.

16:24.716 --> 16:27.083
He was kind of a mean old crank.

16:27.085 --> 16:31.354
Sheldon, I promise
that I will work my hardest

16:31.356 --> 16:32.789
to make this show great

16:32.791 --> 16:34.390
so that a whole
new generation of kids

16:34.392 --> 16:36.392
will grow up
and they will be able to say

16:36.394 --> 16:39.962
that Professor Proton was the
reason they got into science.

16:40.799 --> 16:42.598
Wow.

16:42.600 --> 16:45.134
That was very persuasive.

16:45.136 --> 16:46.302
Thanks.

16:46.304 --> 16:48.304
But I won't be seduced
by your acting skills

16:48.306 --> 16:51.007
nor your movie star charisma.

16:52.310 --> 16:53.976
There's
only one Professor Proton,

16:53.978 --> 16:56.412
and he had neither
of those things.

16:56.414 --> 16:59.115
I'll give you one more
chance to bow out.

16:59.117 --> 17:01.317
Or what?

17:02.120 --> 17:04.954
When we first met,
we were enemies,

17:04.955 --> 17:08.458
but we worked through that
and we became friends.

17:08.460 --> 17:10.460
Do you really want to go back?

17:10.462 --> 17:13.796
Honestly, it doesn't feel
very different.

17:16.935 --> 17:18.634
I'm not leaving!

17:18.636 --> 17:21.337
All right, I'm gonna sic
my dog on you.

17:22.173 --> 17:24.173
You don't have a dog.

17:24.175 --> 17:25.575
Yes, I do.

17:25.577 --> 17:27.510
Ugh, I can't tell
if you're lying--

17:27.512 --> 17:28.845
you're such a good actor!

17:33.251 --> 17:34.751
Hey, how you doing?

17:34.753 --> 17:36.753
What are you
doing here?

17:36.755 --> 17:41.858
Oh, I just came by, you know,
to see if you need any help.

17:41.860 --> 17:43.826
Howard and Bernadette
asked you to check up on me.

17:43.828 --> 17:45.862
That is not entirely true.

17:45.864 --> 17:49.031
So did Leonard and... everybody.

17:49.033 --> 17:52.168
How irresponsible
do you all think I am?

17:52.170 --> 17:54.070
We don't think
you're irresponsible.

17:54.072 --> 17:55.805
We think you're...

17:55.807 --> 17:57.774
fun-loving.

17:57.776 --> 18:01.210
That is just a nice word
for “irresponsible.”

18:01.212 --> 18:04.781
Hmm. You might be more
on the ball than we thought.

18:06.885 --> 18:09.118
I'm getting
a little hungry.

18:09.120 --> 18:10.620
Want me to get
it this time?

18:10.622 --> 18:12.555
That'd be great.

18:15.560 --> 18:17.627
This is fun.

18:17.629 --> 18:19.729
And now you also get
to see an annoyed blonde

18:19.731 --> 18:21.964
walk into the room.

18:21.966 --> 18:24.734
What?

18:24.736 --> 18:26.769
Can you get us
a little snack?

18:26.771 --> 18:29.438
You sure you don't want
your spy to do it?

18:29.440 --> 18:30.873
What are you talking about?

18:30.875 --> 18:33.209
You really don't trust me?
You had to have Amy stop by?

18:33.211 --> 18:34.777
We trust you.
Yeah.

18:34.779 --> 18:36.479
You were a terrible waitress,

18:36.481 --> 18:39.382
and we still asked you
to get us a snack.

18:41.719 --> 18:44.320
Excuse me while I go
take care of your baby.

18:44.322 --> 18:45.421
Then I'll bring
you your snack,

18:45.423 --> 18:47.323
and you can insult me some more.

18:48.927 --> 18:50.326
I don't know
about you,

18:50.328 --> 18:54.597
but I am not eating
whatever she brings us.

18:54.599 --> 18:57.233
Hey, Halley. Aw, it's okay.

18:57.235 --> 19:00.469
Auntie Penny's here. Shh.
Let's get you changed.

19:00.471 --> 19:02.438
Your mommy and daddy say
they trust me,

19:02.440 --> 19:04.841
but they're full of
the same stuff your diaper is.

19:05.977 --> 19:08.811
Now I feel bad.

19:08.813 --> 19:10.546
Well, she never really liked me.

19:10.548 --> 19:13.182
It's kind of nice
she hates you now, too.

19:13.184 --> 19:15.451
Aw, but I'm here for you,

19:15.453 --> 19:17.053
and I would never let anything
happen to you,

19:17.055 --> 19:20.089
because your Auntie Penny
loves you so much.

19:20.091 --> 19:22.325
Mama.

19:29.067 --> 19:31.167
Was that her first word?

19:31.169 --> 19:33.603
Mama.

19:33.605 --> 19:36.172
Uh, no. No, baby.
I'm not your mama.

19:36.174 --> 19:38.975
Your mama's the nice lady
we're gonna go see right now

19:38.977 --> 19:42.311
so I can rub this in her face.

19:42.313 --> 19:43.980
Do you hear that, suckers?

19:43.982 --> 19:46.782
She called me Mama!

20:04.617 --> 20:06.850
Hello, Arthur.

20:06.852 --> 20:08.719
You-you know,

20:08.721 --> 20:14.124
we could... we could also meet
in-in a deli.

20:15.928 --> 20:18.529
I'm sorry to say
that I failed you.

20:18.531 --> 20:21.365
I tried to stop Wil Wheaton
being Professor Proton,

20:21.367 --> 20:23.100
but I couldn't.

20:23.102 --> 20:26.337
See, now,
that's-that's the kind of thing

20:26.339 --> 20:29.807
you could tell a fella over a...

20:29.809 --> 20:32.476
pastrami sandwich.

20:36.682 --> 20:38.382
Well, don't worry.

20:38.384 --> 20:40.951
He's now on my enemies list
forever.

20:40.953 --> 20:42.619
He's totally cut off.

20:42.621 --> 20:44.321
Interesting.

20:44.323 --> 20:48.713
Can-can anyone sign-sign up
for that list?
