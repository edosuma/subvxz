01:13.660 --> 01:17.187
<i>This is me
before the accident.</i>

01:18.260 --> 01:22.345
<i>And here's me after I was
barbecued in jet fuel.</i>

01:22.420 --> 01:26.186
<i>The old me was content,
virtuous,</i>

01:26.260 --> 01:28.183
<i>believed in everything.</i>

01:40.180 --> 01:42.308
Marshmallow.

01:43.420 --> 01:45.468
<i>What an idiot.</i>

01:48.500 --> 01:50.901
And now,
we have a very special young lady

01:50.980 --> 01:52.823
with a message of healing.

01:52.900 --> 01:55.471
Lamb Mannerheim has been
a member of our church family

01:55.540 --> 01:58.828
since she was
knee high to a bug.

01:58.900 --> 02:02.268
She's been a valued
youth evangelist,

02:02.340 --> 02:05.264
the Valedictorian of
her home school collective,

02:05.340 --> 02:08.071
and a performer right here
in our music ministry.

02:09.539 --> 02:11.383
As all of you know,

02:11.460 --> 02:14.543
our Lamb survived
a tragic accident

02:14.660 --> 02:16.389
one year ago.

02:16.460 --> 02:22.308
As a community,
we shared in her pain and loss.

02:22.380 --> 02:26.544
But now she is
miraculously back on her feet,

02:26.620 --> 02:30.102
and here with us
to share her message

02:30.180 --> 02:32.911
of faith and courage.

02:32.980 --> 02:36.029
Brothers and sisters,
Lamb Mannerheim.

02:46.620 --> 02:48.622
Hi.

02:48.700 --> 02:51.431
Thanks, Pastor Rick.
Pastor Rick.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.787
Good morning, everyone.

02:53.860 --> 02:57.501
- Good morning.
- She looks so nice.

02:57.620 --> 03:00.942
Look, I know you're all
pretending that you're here

03:01.020 --> 03:03.466
for my testimony about how,
through the grace of God,

03:03.540 --> 03:06.510
I recovered from
my near-fatal accident.

03:06.580 --> 03:08.662
But let's be honest.

03:08.740 --> 03:11.061
You're really just hoping to hear
the gory details about the crash.

03:11.140 --> 03:13.347
Like, for instance,

03:13.420 --> 03:15.707
how I could smell myself burning,

03:15.780 --> 03:18.386
but I couldn't
actually feel anything.

03:18.460 --> 03:21.430
Isn't that weird?

03:21.500 --> 03:26.108
I landed in the parking lot
of a Kroger... on fire,

03:26.180 --> 03:29.468
and all I could think
about was my shoes,

03:29.540 --> 03:33.306
that they looked strange.

03:33.380 --> 03:36.463
And then I realized,
oh, they're melting,

03:36.540 --> 03:38.383
and so am I.

03:38.460 --> 03:41.782
Well, the accident was bad,

03:41.860 --> 03:44.227
but the surgeries...

03:44.300 --> 03:47.702
the surgeries,
those were worse.

03:47.780 --> 03:50.863
Did you know that they can
take skin from your rear end...

03:50.940 --> 03:54.103
...and put it on your back?

03:54.180 --> 03:58.185
But then, where does that
leave your rear end?

03:58.260 --> 04:01.309
Looks like thong underwear is out
of the question for me now, right?

04:03.420 --> 04:05.343
But enough about that.

04:05.420 --> 04:08.344
What I'm really here to say today
is that the horrible,

04:08.420 --> 04:12.345
unspeakable torment
that I had to endure

04:12.420 --> 04:15.310
didn't strengthen
my faith in the slightest.

04:15.380 --> 04:18.827
No benevolent being would
do that to one of his children.

04:18.899 --> 04:19.503
Doug.

04:21.300 --> 04:23.189
So I feel compelled to share
my true testimony with you.

04:23.260 --> 04:27.584
There is no God.

05:19.100 --> 05:21.990
<i>There's me
before the crash again.</i>

05:22.060 --> 05:25.348
<i>Perfect skin, perfect pitch.</i>

05:31.420 --> 05:32.990
<i>Perfect bitch.</i>

05:34.740 --> 05:37.107
<i>My parents watch this
all the time</i>

05:37.180 --> 05:39.308
<i>to remember when
I was the golden child.</i>

05:39.380 --> 05:42.509
<i>Makes me actually vomit.</i>

05:42.580 --> 05:44.423
She is just sharing her gift.

05:47.580 --> 05:49.821
<i>I should mention that
young ladies in my community</i>

05:49.900 --> 05:51.345
<i>aren't allowed
to wear pants, go to college,</i>

05:51.460 --> 05:53.667
<i>show their legs, cut their hair,</i>

05:53.740 --> 05:56.141
<i>read popular fiction,
or listen to the radio.</i>

05:56.220 --> 05:58.791
<i>This performance
is considered edgy.</i>

05:58.860 --> 06:02.387
<i>But today, I was supposed
to get back on the proverbial bike,</i>

06:02.460 --> 06:04.144
<i>walk into that church,</i>

06:04.220 --> 06:07.463
<i>and show everyone how, through
my steadfast faith, I was healed.</i>

06:07.540 --> 06:10.669
<i>Everyone was looking
forward to my testimony.</i>

06:10.740 --> 06:14.790
<i>They were also pretty psyched
about my settlement money.</i>

06:14.900 --> 06:16.425
<i>Now...</i>

06:19.620 --> 06:22.271
I just picked this up in town.

06:22.340 --> 06:26.709
It's all natural minerals
from the earth.

06:26.780 --> 06:29.306
It's makeup.

06:29.380 --> 06:34.022
It's to enhance your countenance.

06:34.100 --> 06:36.148
There.

06:38.060 --> 06:41.030
Dr. Cha says I'm not supposed
to put anything on there.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.102
Lamb, it's 100% natural.

06:43.220 --> 06:45.826
The lady at the mall says
she puts it on her 4-year-old.

06:45.900 --> 06:48.141
Why?

06:53.340 --> 06:57.902
Do you feel ready to give
your inspirational talk?

06:57.980 --> 06:59.903
If you get stage fright,

06:59.980 --> 07:03.109
just imagine Pastor Rick
in his pajamas.

07:04.460 --> 07:06.747
No, thanks.

07:06.820 --> 07:09.391
Let me just hear the beginning.

07:09.460 --> 07:11.189
Do we really have to
do this right now?

07:12.260 --> 07:13.500
<i>No.</i>

07:15.260 --> 07:18.582
Just remember, our whole
community is relying on you today.

07:18.660 --> 07:21.231
There is no God.

07:23.340 --> 07:26.583
Don't touch me.
My skin grafts are really fragile.

07:26.660 --> 07:29.823
I could bleed all over
your nice, new carpeting,

07:29.900 --> 07:31.390
and then you'd have to
take up yet another collection.

07:31.460 --> 07:33.144
Another collection.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.109
You guys already tithed
most of your money

07:35.180 --> 07:37.103
to this place anyway,
so what's the difference?

07:37.180 --> 07:38.909
Get her down, Melanie.

07:38.980 --> 07:41.506
- Lamb, stop.
- I'm almost done, Mama.

07:41.580 --> 07:44.709
- I don't believe in God.
- Lamb.

07:44.780 --> 07:47.465
But here's what I do believe.
I believe in science.

07:47.540 --> 07:50.111
I believe in
the doctors and the nurses

07:50.180 --> 07:52.148
who saved my life in the hospital.

07:52.220 --> 07:54.791
I believe in
prescription opiates,

07:54.860 --> 07:56.908
which work whether
you put faith in them or not,

07:56.980 --> 07:59.062
- Lies!
- And I'm willing to believe that...

07:59.140 --> 08:01.541
...the universe was created
in an explosion,

08:01.620 --> 08:03.622
and that fish creatures
crawled out of the mud...

08:03.700 --> 08:05.111
...and evolved into human beings.
- Devil's lies.

08:05.220 --> 08:07.826
And finally, in our next
presidential election,

08:07.900 --> 08:09.789
I may vote Democrat.

08:09.860 --> 08:11.624
- Blasphemy!
- Democrat?!

08:11.700 --> 08:14.067
Before I'm forcibly
removed from here,

08:14.140 --> 08:15.585
I want to let you all know
that I am leaving Blakesley.

08:15.660 --> 08:16.866
I'm out of here.

08:16.980 --> 08:18.823
I'm going to Las Vegas,
Nevada, tomorrow,

08:18.940 --> 08:22.547
where I plan to gamble
and dance.

08:22.620 --> 08:24.588
- Heretic!
- And drink alcohol,

08:24.660 --> 08:26.822
and frolic with
homosexuals and--

08:26.900 --> 08:30.791
I'm very sorry.
My daughter is still recovering.

08:30.860 --> 08:33.703
- What? Mother, I'm beautiful.
- Please pray for her.

08:33.780 --> 08:36.101
Or don't. The last time
you prayed for me...

08:36.179 --> 08:38.990
...I wound up looking like this.
- Let's get you out of here.

08:39.059 --> 08:42.188
My arms look like
turkey bacon. God who?

08:48.100 --> 08:51.388
<i>After church,
my parents cried and prayed,</i>

08:51.460 --> 08:54.066
<i>and cry-prayed-</i>

08:54.140 --> 08:56.063
<i>But it was too late.</i>

08:56.140 --> 08:58.347
<i>I had booked
an economy class fare</i>

08:58.420 --> 09:00.422
<i>to Satan's playground.</i>

09:05.860 --> 09:07.430
<i>I've got a heart full of rage,</i>

09:07.500 --> 09:10.185
<i>and an L.L. Bean tote bag
full of cash.</i>

09:10.260 --> 09:12.991
<i>Hello, Las Vegas.</i>

09:25.740 --> 09:28.823
<i>Let the sin begin.</i>

09:40.620 --> 09:43.544
Wait, I've got
dishes in there. Oh!

09:54.540 --> 09:56.542
I think that guy
broke my dishes.

09:56.620 --> 09:59.021
Why you bring dishes
to Las Vegas?

09:59.100 --> 10:02.900
We have plates, cups,
gravy boats.

10:02.980 --> 10:04.664
Hey, sir, sir.

10:04.740 --> 10:06.583
Do you have
a shoulder belt?

10:06.660 --> 10:10.142
What, you want baby seat, too?
Goo-goo, ga-ga. Fisher-Price.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.348
<i>My dad told me
I should run and hide</i>

10:15.420 --> 10:17.184
<i>if I ever encounter a Muslim.</i>

10:17.260 --> 10:20.867
<i>Unfortunately,
I'm in a moving vehicle.</i>

10:20.980 --> 10:22.789
Ah, I hate this Trop light.

10:22.860 --> 10:24.862
Trop light?

10:24.940 --> 10:27.705
Tropicana.
Longest light in town.

10:32.860 --> 10:34.430
Looks like Disney World.

10:34.500 --> 10:37.424
You been there?
Disneyland?

10:37.500 --> 10:39.582
I wasn't allowed,

10:39.660 --> 10:41.947
because the Disney corporation
supports a homosexual agenda.

10:42.020 --> 10:45.467
They even have a special day
at the park just for homosexuals.

10:45.540 --> 10:47.668
Homosexuals, yeah.

10:47.740 --> 10:49.469
Last night, in this cab,
I have two gay guys. They get married.

10:49.540 --> 10:51.304
I have no problem with it.

10:51.380 --> 10:53.223
As long as they keep
their penis in the pants.

10:53.300 --> 10:55.302
I tell them, if I see the gay,

10:55.380 --> 10:58.031
if I see any Doogie Howser
bullshit, you're out.

11:14.220 --> 11:16.951
- Thanks.
- Thank you, Mickey Mouse.

11:17.020 --> 11:21.628
You sure? Okay.
Red Lobster, baby.

11:23.180 --> 11:25.069
Enjoy your Premium
Vista Suite, Miss Mannerheim.

11:25.140 --> 11:26.665
Thanks.

11:26.740 --> 11:28.902
I'm lovin' the hair
and the whole thing.

11:28.980 --> 11:31.950
You goin' to that '80s night?

11:32.020 --> 11:36.105
I've seen some people
really commit, but that is like...

11:36.220 --> 11:37.824
tubular.

11:37.900 --> 11:39.345
Totally.

11:41.740 --> 11:44.141
<i>This requires

but I'm rollin'
so hard right now.

12:05.900 --> 12:08.380
Dude, I'm flyin'.

12:08.460 --> 12:10.747
Hey, we should call
that chick from Marquee,

12:10.820 --> 12:13.027

12:13.100 --> 12:15.148
Phenomenal.

12:22.740 --> 12:25.869
Hi.

12:25.980 --> 12:28.790
Hi.

12:28.900 --> 12:31.221
Where you from, cutie?

12:35.220 --> 12:38.303
Uh, does the curtains
match the drape?

12:40.660 --> 12:43.106
Don't even make sense.

12:51.620 --> 12:53.429
I look legit fat.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.389
No, you don't.
You look gorgeous.

12:55.460 --> 12:58.145
Zoe, those shoes
are phenomenal.

12:58.260 --> 13:00.581
I think I should barf again.

13:06.140 --> 13:08.268
Phenomenal.

13:13.140 --> 13:15.381
Phenomenal.

13:35.620 --> 13:38.146
Ah, shoot.

17:57.060 --> 17:58.744
Stop singing!

17:58.820 --> 18:01.266
I will have...

18:01.340 --> 18:04.344
Seriously. Stop.

18:04.420 --> 18:07.151
A peach schnapp.

18:07.220 --> 18:10.224
- You're gonna have a...
- A peach schnapp.

18:10.300 --> 18:13.065
Good choice, madam.
Very good choice.

18:13.140 --> 18:16.462
Um, yes, would you like some
ice with your peach schnapp?

18:16.580 --> 18:18.628
No, it takes up too much room.

18:18.700 --> 18:19.940
I want as much liquor
as possible.

18:20.020 --> 18:22.500
That's very smart.
Really smart.

counselor at my youth camp</i>

18:28.500 --> 18:30.309
<i>named Gaye.</i>

18:30.380 --> 18:32.860
<i>This man is not Gaye.</i>

18:32.940 --> 18:36.786
"I dice Las Vegas."

18:36.860 --> 18:38.783
Yeah, it doesn't really make sense.

18:38.860 --> 18:43.070
Not unless you came to Vegas
to chop up its residents

18:43.140 --> 18:45.302
into little cubes with a knife.

18:45.380 --> 18:46.870
Gotta be the worst
thing I've ever seen.

18:46.940 --> 18:48.430
Okay, thanks.

18:48.500 --> 18:50.389
Yeah, right over here, baby.
No, don't go off-stage.

18:50.460 --> 18:51.791
Don't go? What's up?

18:51.860 --> 18:53.191
Are you gonna sing?

18:53.260 --> 18:55.103
Wha...? No, no, no.

18:55.180 --> 18:57.786
I don't sing.
I don't sing for nobody.

18:57.860 --> 19:00.670
That whole bar-tainer thing,
that lacks dignity.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.265
I'm a little bit too cool for--

19:02.340 --> 19:03.580
Can you refill my dick?

19:03.660 --> 19:06.106
I don't mind doing this, though.

19:06.180 --> 19:08.467
This is perfectly respectable.

19:10.620 --> 19:12.702
Here's your plastic
penis full of liquor.

19:12.780 --> 19:15.226
- Thank you.
- Enjoy your lifestyle.

19:15.300 --> 19:16.540
Ladies and gentlemen,
coming to the stage right now,

19:16.620 --> 19:18.782
an immensely talented
young lady...

19:18.860 --> 19:21.591
You're in luck tonight, because my
best friend Loray is about to perform.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.981
She's amazing. Check this out.

19:24.060 --> 19:25.983
You're in for a real treat.

19:26.060 --> 19:28.062
...very own soulful diva,

19:28.140 --> 19:30.541
Lo ray.

19:30.620 --> 19:34.591
Oh, look at that dress.

19:34.700 --> 19:37.271
- Oh, it's a black chick.
- Come on, baby.

19:37.340 --> 19:39.342
Give me something, sister.

19:39.420 --> 19:40.546
Hello, Hi-Lo.

19:40.620 --> 19:43.624
Go, Aretha.

19:43.700 --> 19:46.465
- Do Aretha.
- Come on, sister.

19:46.540 --> 19:48.781
Girl's got a lot to give.

19:57.660 --> 20:01.187
Oh, she's not supposed
to sing this. She's been warned.

20:01.260 --> 20:05.822
Turn the volume down
on your dress, girl!

20:11.100 --> 20:14.946
I thought she'd have soul.

20:17.180 --> 20:19.228
Boo!

20:32.340 --> 20:34.946
Get on outta here.

20:42.300 --> 20:44.780
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you so much.

20:44.860 --> 20:47.670
Thank you, Loray.
Loray, ladies and gentlemen.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.582
I'm Lamb Mannerheim.

20:53.660 --> 20:56.948
Hi. I'm William Carr.

20:57.020 --> 20:58.863
Lovely to meet you.

21:10.460 --> 21:11.700
Oh, Christ, are you...

21:11.780 --> 21:14.431
are you all right?

21:14.500 --> 21:16.741
Wow, I've never
seen that happen before.

21:16.820 --> 21:19.346
You're using your nose
like a little funnel.

21:19.420 --> 21:20.865
Are you all right, love?

21:20.940 --> 21:22.385
That was my first drink ever.

21:22.460 --> 21:24.667
Honestly?

21:24.740 --> 21:26.344
I tell you what,
you could've fooled me.

21:26.420 --> 21:28.309
You're like Humphrey Bogart
or something with that.

21:28.380 --> 21:30.144
That was remarkable.

21:30.220 --> 21:34.384
Let me get you something
that's a bit more your speed.

21:42.660 --> 21:45.903
Do you want something
a bit stronger, like a gun?

21:50.140 --> 21:52.586
Well, the good news is,

21:52.660 --> 21:54.947
I'm off for the night.

21:55.020 --> 21:57.182
The bad news is humanity.

21:57.300 --> 21:59.348
Do you know what?
Screw humanity.

21:59.420 --> 22:03.186
'Cause I was watching you out there,
Loray, and you were amazing.

22:03.260 --> 22:04.864
Management keeps saying
they want me to sing

22:04.940 --> 22:06.908
Aretha Franklin.
Can you believe that?

22:06.980 --> 22:09.187
Yeah, I know.
It's really weird, isn't it,

22:09.260 --> 22:11.991
that they want you to sing
an upbeat Aretha Franklin song

22:12.060 --> 22:14.347
here in this place of merriment.

22:14.420 --> 22:15.626
I think it's a conspiracy.

22:15.700 --> 22:18.101
This is whitey
trying to keep you down.

22:20.620 --> 22:22.941
I loved your song.
Did you write it?

22:23.020 --> 22:24.943
No, it's Radiohead.

22:25.020 --> 22:28.149
Is that spelled how it sounds?

22:28.220 --> 22:33.260
Loray, this is Lamb,
my new friend.

22:33.340 --> 22:35.388
Uh-oh.

22:35.460 --> 22:37.906
Excuse me?

22:37.980 --> 22:39.550
Let me guess.

22:39.620 --> 22:42.669
You came here to be a showgirl.

22:42.740 --> 22:45.710
- No.
- Oh, come on.

22:45.780 --> 22:48.465
Sittin' here alone
on suicide Tuesday.

22:48.540 --> 22:50.542
Weave down to your ass.

22:50.620 --> 22:52.827
- My hair?
- Bleached blonde.

22:52.940 --> 22:54.783
Real blonde, I'm half Finnish.

22:54.900 --> 22:58.825
Well, look at that.
I'm half finished, too.

22:58.900 --> 23:00.948
Top me off.

23:01.020 --> 23:03.022
Do you know what, Lamb?

23:03.100 --> 23:05.307
Loray may seem a little
abrasive and crude,

23:05.380 --> 23:07.382
but underneath that exterior...

23:07.460 --> 23:08.791
What are you doing?
Why are you not listening to me?

23:08.860 --> 23:12.103
Why are you not enchanted?
Where are you going? Don't go in there!

23:16.020 --> 23:18.102
Oh.

23:20.980 --> 23:25.065
You look like an angry baby cobra.

23:28.100 --> 23:32.025
Look, sorry for
givin' you shit back there.

23:32.100 --> 23:36.150
Sometimes the entertainment
needs to be entertained.

23:36.220 --> 23:38.791
- I'm not a showgirl.
- No one cares what you are, honey.

23:38.900 --> 23:40.902
I care very much.

23:40.980 --> 23:44.382
I care about the message
that I send out into the world.

23:44.460 --> 23:48.067
Besides, I could never
do that anyway.

23:48.140 --> 23:50.711
People would stare. My skin.

23:50.780 --> 23:53.704
Yeah? I got a skin condition, too.

23:53.780 --> 23:55.509
It's called black.

23:55.580 --> 23:57.582
People would stare.

23:57.660 --> 23:59.742
I don't know what that's like.

23:59.820 --> 24:02.391
Do you wanna know
why I'm here?

24:02.460 --> 24:05.384
I come from a small town
where I wasn't allowed

24:05.460 --> 24:08.270
to date or dance or even
go to regular school.

24:08.340 --> 24:12.140
I was in a plane crash
that left half my body disfigured,

24:12.220 --> 24:13.904
and I don't think
I believe in God anymore.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.863
I left home for
the first time today,

24:15.980 --> 24:19.462
because I've missed out
on everything.

24:19.540 --> 24:22.225
Now I just wanna...

24:22.300 --> 24:25.031
experience worldly pleasures
for the first time.

24:26.100 --> 24:27.909
Wow.

24:27.980 --> 24:30.347
Am I in the first
five minutes of pornography?

24:33.340 --> 24:37.026
That is quite
the pitch there, Lamb.

24:37.100 --> 24:41.264
I mean, I have heard
some pretty crazy stories

24:41.380 --> 24:45.305
from some broken
weirdoes

24:45.380 --> 24:48.782
here in the People's
Republic of Bad Choices.

24:50.580 --> 24:53.106
That story takes
the whole hash brownie.

24:56.100 --> 24:58.341
Oh.

25:00.020 --> 25:01.670
Oh.

25:04.380 --> 25:07.543
Is it possible
you're tellin' the truth?

25:07.620 --> 25:10.464
I just wanna be...

25:10.540 --> 25:12.781
like, a regular American.

25:14.580 --> 25:17.151
- So where we going?
- I don't know yet.

25:17.220 --> 25:21.111
If I leave you by yourself, you're gonna
wind up someplace scary,

25:21.180 --> 25:23.751
like the trunk of a car
or Circus Circus.

25:23.820 --> 25:26.949
And I can't leave you here.

25:27.020 --> 25:30.103
You're just a deep-fried
Twinkie from where?

25:30.220 --> 25:34.191
- Montana.
- From Montana. Population four.

25:34.260 --> 25:36.547
And you came here
to get your rocks off.

25:36.620 --> 25:39.191
Did you even have
anything specific in mind?

25:39.260 --> 25:42.503
A little drinking,
games of chance,

25:42.580 --> 25:44.867
your basic abominations.

25:44.940 --> 25:47.466
What's going on with you ladies?

25:47.540 --> 25:50.066
I'm goin' downtown,
and I'm takin' her with me.

25:50.140 --> 25:52.222
Right. Okay.

25:52.300 --> 25:54.029
Why don't you leave her here?

25:54.100 --> 25:57.024
Because I want to get drunk
and kiss boys,

25:57.100 --> 25:59.706
and I don't wanna find this one
on a milk carton tomorrow.

25:59.780 --> 26:01.703
You'd sell a lot of milk, though.

26:01.780 --> 26:03.908
- Why don't you join us?
- Oh...

26:03.980 --> 26:05.266
- That's... ah.
- Sorry.

26:05.380 --> 26:08.702
I'm afraid William
is working until 4:00,

26:08.780 --> 26:10.908
so he won't be doing
any joining this evening.

26:10.980 --> 26:14.268
Actually, Carol has lost
custody of her kids,

26:14.340 --> 26:17.469
as usual, so she wants
to work an extra shift,

26:17.540 --> 26:19.383
so I could clock off at 11:00,

26:19.460 --> 26:22.031
and I could come find you,
so why don't you give me a call...

26:22.100 --> 26:24.421
- I got your number. Have a nice night.
- Make sure you call.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.662
You look like
you're not gonna call.

26:26.740 --> 26:29.346
Wait, this is to pay
for my schnapp.

26:29.420 --> 26:31.866
Oh, that's really not necessary.

26:31.940 --> 26:33.305
Thank you. What a sweet girl.

26:33.380 --> 26:35.064
Make sure you call, right?

26:35.140 --> 26:37.268
What's your last name?

26:37.340 --> 26:38.705
Mannerheim.

26:38.780 --> 26:40.509
- Jewish?
- No!

26:40.580 --> 26:42.742
- Sorry?
- No, it's cool.

26:42.820 --> 26:45.630
Did you really think
I was a Jew?

26:45.700 --> 26:47.987
Wow. A Jew.

26:48.060 --> 26:50.870
Could you, uh,
hold that thought?

26:50.940 --> 26:52.624
I'll be right back.

26:54.660 --> 26:56.389
Here ya' go.

26:56.460 --> 26:57.586
Be lucky.

26:57.660 --> 27:00.425
Hey, listen.

27:00.500 --> 27:04.027
I was thinkin' maybe
you could stick around here.

27:04.100 --> 27:05.943
Let Carol have the night off.

27:06.020 --> 27:09.388
Carol needs structure
right now, okay?

27:09.460 --> 27:12.270
And I like
the weird ones, you know?

27:12.340 --> 27:15.310
This kid's far from home.
She's from Montana.

27:15.380 --> 27:17.348
I'm from England.
You're not looking after me.

27:17.420 --> 27:19.991
Do you know what it's like,
you know when you're a kid,

27:20.060 --> 27:22.870
and you go to bed,
and it snows overnight,

27:22.940 --> 27:25.102
and you wake up the next day,

27:25.180 --> 27:28.263
and everything
looks pure and pristine

27:28.380 --> 27:31.668
and perfect, and you just
wanna get your boots on,

27:31.740 --> 27:34.027
and get out there and mess it up?

27:34.100 --> 27:36.580
I'm from Florida.

27:48.220 --> 27:49.551
Hey, can we go
to Chalet?

27:49.620 --> 27:53.102
You know, Las Vegas'
hottest night club?

27:53.180 --> 27:55.581
Chalet? No way.

27:55.700 --> 27:56.986
The place is a health hazard.

27:57.060 --> 27:58.630
Do you wanna get syphilis?

27:58.700 --> 28:01.101
We are not going to Chalet.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.784
You wanna see Las Vegas?

28:02.860 --> 28:05.989
- Gotta go to Las Vegas.
- We're in Las Vegas.

28:06.060 --> 28:09.382
No, we're not. We're in Paradise.

28:09.460 --> 28:12.066
They call this the Vegas strip.

28:12.140 --> 28:14.905
It's actually located in
a census-designated area

28:14.980 --> 28:16.186
called Paradise.

28:16.260 --> 28:18.866
Paradise, Nevada.

28:18.940 --> 28:20.590
Most tourists don't know that.

28:20.660 --> 28:22.344
They think they're going to Vegas,

28:22.420 --> 28:23.910
when, technically,
they're in Paradise.

28:24.020 --> 28:26.227
Maybe we should
just stay in Paradise.

28:26.300 --> 28:29.861
No. Paradise is
processed cheese.

28:29.940 --> 28:33.342
You want a rollercoaster,
and a fake Eiffel Tower,

28:33.420 --> 28:35.149
and a bunch of people
from St. Louis

28:35.220 --> 28:38.941
clappin' for a friggin'
computerized fountain?

28:39.020 --> 28:41.102
Yay! Robot fountain.

28:41.180 --> 28:44.502
No, you want
the real Las Vegas.

28:44.580 --> 28:45.991
Where the locals go.

28:46.060 --> 28:48.188
If you hate it so much,

28:48.260 --> 28:50.866
why don't you just leave?

28:50.940 --> 28:53.022
There's not a lot of call
for singing tap jockeys

28:53.100 --> 28:55.023
in other parts of the country.

28:56.820 --> 28:58.709
Where's your family?

28:58.780 --> 29:01.670
You just met him.

29:04.100 --> 29:06.387
Oh, the Trop light.

29:06.460 --> 29:08.861
It's the worst, huh?

29:08.980 --> 29:11.711
<i>Oy vey.</i>

29:17.540 --> 29:19.508
Glitter gulch.

29:19.580 --> 29:22.311
Here's some realism for you.

29:22.380 --> 29:24.348
This is where you go to have fun?

29:24.420 --> 29:26.787
Sure, when I'm not in school...

29:26.860 --> 29:30.307
...or degrading myself at the Hi-Lo.
- You go to school?

29:30.420 --> 29:33.902
Yeah. I'm finishing up
my bachelor's at UNLV,

29:33.980 --> 29:37.189
if I can come up with seven grand.

29:37.300 --> 29:39.667
Is that so shocking?

29:39.740 --> 29:41.947
You don't have
any black friends, do you?

29:42.020 --> 29:44.591
Everyone says they have
the one black friend.

29:44.660 --> 29:46.264
You don't even know him, huh?

29:46.340 --> 29:49.184
So what's your major?

29:49.260 --> 29:51.024
Film.

29:51.100 --> 29:53.387
How cool.

29:53.460 --> 29:55.667
We didn't have anything
like that at my college.

29:55.740 --> 29:57.469
Really?

29:57.540 --> 30:00.783
No student filmmakers?
Nobody made shorts?

30:00.860 --> 30:03.830
We weren't even allowed
to wear shorts.

30:07.260 --> 30:10.469
Almost there. We just have
to cut through the experience.

30:10.540 --> 30:12.702
What's the experience?

30:12.780 --> 30:15.260
This baby boomer,
magic mushroom shit show.

30:17.820 --> 30:20.391
Walk, Walk, walk!

30:20.460 --> 30:23.384
Okay, Sherri Shepherd.

30:26.660 --> 30:28.469
You wanna do that, huh?

30:28.540 --> 30:31.271
Yeah. I really wanna do that.

30:31.340 --> 30:34.469
I would need about ten drinks.

30:34.540 --> 30:37.020
Oh, man.

30:37.100 --> 30:39.910
Get back to me in an hour.

30:40.980 --> 30:43.347
Oh, sin.

30:43.420 --> 30:45.866
Perfect. Is that
where we're going?

30:45.940 --> 30:49.990
Yeah, but it means
service industry night.

30:50.060 --> 30:52.825
Cheap libations for those of us
in the hospitality sector.

30:52.900 --> 30:54.982
Like bar-tainers?

30:55.060 --> 30:58.507
Bar-tainers, waitrons,
gondoliers, go-go boys,

30:58.580 --> 31:00.548
human sushi platters.

31:00.620 --> 31:02.588
Human sushi platters?

31:02.660 --> 31:05.504
Yeah. My friend Christian's
been doin' it for a year.

31:05.580 --> 31:08.151
She has to wash herself
with this special soap.

31:08.220 --> 31:10.621
Before or after?

31:10.700 --> 31:13.510
Before. I think after,
she just cries.

31:16.060 --> 31:18.666
All right, let's
get this over with. Pull.

31:25.500 --> 31:27.184
<i>Sorry, pardner. Try again.</i>

31:27.260 --> 31:30.901
- Did I lose?
- Uh, yeah, Lamb.

31:30.980 --> 31:32.982
You lost. You gambled.

31:33.060 --> 31:35.461
And now, you see why
it's pointless. Let's perambulate.

31:35.540 --> 31:37.542
<i>Okay, what's bar?</i>

31:37.620 --> 31:40.703
<i>Did I just pay a machine
to tell me where I am?</i>

31:43.780 --> 31:46.545
- Charlie.
- What are we thinkin'?

31:46.620 --> 31:49.385
I'm thinkin' we're gonna
need some shots.

31:49.460 --> 31:50.905
Oh, my God.

31:50.980 --> 31:53.790
What's up,
Little House on the Prairie?

31:53.860 --> 31:55.464
Look at this denim skirt.

31:58.620 --> 32:01.544
Hey, uh, Charlie, you got
any scissors back there?

32:08.980 --> 32:10.266
I don't know.

32:10.340 --> 32:12.911
My legs are gonna look weird.

32:12.980 --> 32:16.143
Well, can't you take
these stockings off?

32:16.220 --> 32:18.222
<i>No.</i>

32:19.500 --> 32:23.300
Well, there are girls here

32:23.380 --> 32:25.462
that are lookin' stupid on purpose.

32:25.540 --> 32:27.463
At least you can't help it.

32:32.340 --> 32:33.387
What's that?

32:33.460 --> 32:35.667
Uh, close.

32:35.740 --> 32:39.711
We are going to do...

32:39.780 --> 32:42.750
a reverse Ally Sheedy,

32:42.860 --> 32:45.261
and whore you up a little.

32:45.340 --> 32:47.946
- Not too much.
- Oh, come on now.

32:52.780 --> 32:55.670
You don't need much.

32:55.740 --> 33:00.428
You're already this
disgustingly perfect Barbie.

33:02.500 --> 33:07.347
Barbie that got melted
by a lighter.

33:14.860 --> 33:19.548
Lamb is, like, from
the backwoods of Montana.

33:19.620 --> 33:22.624
- She was home schooled.
- No!

33:22.700 --> 33:26.261
- That's inspiring.
- It is?

33:26.340 --> 33:30.550
This is so cute on you. It'll cover up
some of your battle damage.

33:30.660 --> 33:33.391
I like it.

33:33.460 --> 33:35.667
- It's a keffiyeh.
- Pardon me?

33:35.740 --> 33:38.505
A keffiyeh.
Like an Arab scarf.

33:38.580 --> 33:40.821
You mean like Muslim?

33:40.900 --> 33:43.426
The public school system
in this country is a joke.

33:43.500 --> 33:45.980
The federal government,
the food pyramid.

33:46.060 --> 33:49.143
Lamb... has never
been to a dance.

33:49.260 --> 33:50.671
She doesn't have email,

33:50.740 --> 33:53.186
and she's never even
seen an R-rated movie.

33:53.260 --> 33:56.582
Don't worry, it's not offensive
to Muslims or anything.

33:56.660 --> 34:00.028
These things are so popular,
they're totally depoliticized.

34:00.100 --> 34:03.183
Basically, you've never been
exposed to any pop culture?

34:05.020 --> 34:06.590
God, you're lucky.

34:06.660 --> 34:08.230
Okay.

34:08.300 --> 34:11.110
- Cute.
- So cute.

34:11.179 --> 34:12.944
Phenomenal.

34:13.020 --> 34:16.422
Why does everyone keep using
that word incorrectly?

34:16.540 --> 34:19.384
It's inaccurate.
The scarf is not a phenomenon.

34:19.500 --> 34:22.025
On you, it is.
You're fresh, bitch.

34:36.300 --> 34:38.428
Oh, look who's on the dance floor,

34:38.500 --> 34:40.422
and hell hasn't swallowed you up.

34:40.500 --> 34:43.264
Are you sure?

34:45.659 --> 34:48.139
Hey, I realize we do
have something in common.

34:48.219 --> 34:49.426
We do, huh?

34:49.500 --> 34:51.581
Yeah. You don't have
any black friends, either.

34:51.699 --> 34:53.509
Drink your beer.

34:55.179 --> 34:57.387
"Snowy Piste"?

34:57.460 --> 34:59.383
It's ironically delicious.

35:04.180 --> 35:07.946
Are you kidding me?
Sweet William, he found us.

35:08.020 --> 35:11.706
How did he even
know we were here?

35:11.780 --> 35:14.431
Jiminy Christmas.

35:22.180 --> 35:24.751
Ladies. That's
a very nice makeover.

35:24.820 --> 35:28.711
Loray Bell, you promised me you were
gonna look after this young lady,

35:28.820 --> 35:32.029
and now, I find you
drinking Snowy Piste.

35:32.100 --> 35:34.262
I haven't had a sip.

35:34.340 --> 35:38.106
It's, uh, kinda turned out
that I'm a failure at drinking.

35:40.260 --> 35:42.831
Well, it turns out that
you are alone in that,

35:42.900 --> 35:45.790
because this woman
is a success at drinking.

35:45.860 --> 35:47.862
We just bought ourselves
a stool-side seat

35:47.940 --> 35:50.102
for a vomit spectacular
in a couple of hours.

35:50.180 --> 35:52.103
Bravo.

35:52.180 --> 35:55.309
I'm gonna go get some water.

35:56.380 --> 35:58.109
See you in a minute.

35:59.540 --> 36:01.349
Can I have some water?

36:02.860 --> 36:05.591
Oi, what are you doing,

36:05.660 --> 36:07.628
parading her around
like Elephant Man?

36:07.700 --> 36:10.306
Oh, like you came here
with good intentions.

36:12.380 --> 36:16.101
Yes, actually, all I am is
good intentions and good hair.

36:16.180 --> 36:19.070
William, look,
this one is different, okay?

36:19.140 --> 36:21.711
She's not like all of
your other "pals."

36:21.780 --> 36:25.068
This one's from, like,
a religious commune, okay?

36:25.140 --> 36:26.824
Where they keep women
as slaves

36:26.900 --> 36:28.664
and force them to have 50 kids,

36:28.740 --> 36:32.028
and make tater-tot casseroles.

36:32.100 --> 36:34.068
Oh, and she's been
in a plane crash. No, seriously.

36:34.140 --> 36:36.347
And her whole body's
all messed up,

36:36.420 --> 36:38.900
and now, she's, like,
forsaken God.

36:44.980 --> 36:47.460
Hey, Lamb.

36:47.540 --> 36:50.623
Do you need some lubricating?

36:50.700 --> 36:54.500
Would you like me to find you
somewhere to sit down?

36:54.580 --> 36:57.709
No, I feel great.

36:59.300 --> 37:01.587
Often, when I feel great,

37:01.660 --> 37:04.470
I lean forlornly against a wall.

37:06.100 --> 37:08.341
There's no seats.

37:08.460 --> 37:10.861
There's actually a bar upstairs.

37:10.940 --> 37:13.750
It's usually closed on weeknights,

37:13.820 --> 37:16.391
but I'm kind of connected,
and you look like a social radical.

37:16.460 --> 37:18.428
We could go and sit down
up there if you want.

37:18.500 --> 37:21.026
I don't know.

37:21.140 --> 37:22.585
I'm good.

37:25.020 --> 37:26.829
- Are you scared of me?
- No.

37:26.900 --> 37:30.109
You are a little bit.
I understand.

37:30.180 --> 37:33.423
Why, because you're
wearing tight pants,

37:33.500 --> 37:35.343
and you've got
some tattoos? Big deal.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.946
I know preachers
who are as cool as you.

37:40.140 --> 37:43.462
Those preachers
are appropriating

37:43.580 --> 37:46.868
a rock-and-roll look
to sell religion,

37:46.940 --> 37:49.102
when religion and rock and roll
are separate things,

37:49.180 --> 37:51.467
and that look
was designed to sell...

37:51.540 --> 37:53.702
something very different.

37:53.780 --> 37:57.023
They're playing a part,
same as you.

37:57.100 --> 37:58.704
I don't know what
you're trying to sell,

37:58.780 --> 38:01.226
but I suspect you're
as toothless as they are.

38:01.300 --> 38:03.189
Toothless?

38:03.260 --> 38:05.103
If I'm so toothless,

38:05.180 --> 38:07.342
then how come you're afraid
to come upstairs with me?

38:07.420 --> 38:11.220
Afraid? You've
gotta be kidding me.

38:11.300 --> 38:12.665
I've spent my entire life
being trained to follow

38:12.740 --> 38:14.390
a man with long hair and a beard.

38:14.460 --> 38:17.669
That would just be
downright predictable.

38:17.780 --> 38:19.862
Know what, Lamb?

38:19.940 --> 38:23.183
I'm just gonna...
I'm just gonna, uh, let you suffer.

38:23.260 --> 38:25.581
- What?
- Yeah. No, seriously.

38:25.660 --> 38:28.550
If you wanna show
how brave you are,

38:28.620 --> 38:31.669
while simultaneously
sitting down in the toilets here,

38:31.740 --> 38:33.902
some of the seats are
smothered in hepatitis B.

38:33.980 --> 38:36.586
So you can kill
two birds with one stone.

38:36.660 --> 38:38.788
Ta-ta.

38:41.500 --> 38:43.582
All right, take me upstairs.

38:43.660 --> 38:45.822
I just need a place to sit down.

38:45.900 --> 38:47.948
- Oh, sure.
- Thanks.

38:48.060 --> 38:50.666
I get really sore and stiff at night.

38:50.740 --> 38:54.790
It's just, I can't really
move that well.

38:54.900 --> 38:56.982
Well, neither can I.

38:57.060 --> 38:58.869
And I haven't even got
a beautiful, tragic excuse.

38:58.940 --> 39:01.102
Plus, I've got $100 that says that

39:01.180 --> 39:03.865
you can still dance
a lot better than I can.

39:07.700 --> 39:09.702
This is really nice.

39:15.940 --> 39:18.864
Well, isn't that
a quirky little affectation?

39:18.940 --> 39:21.546
Actually, it's for
the scar tissue in my hands.

39:28.860 --> 39:32.182
"Rode hard"?

39:32.260 --> 39:35.423
Yeah, um...
I had that done ages ago.

39:35.500 --> 39:37.946
I grew up around horses.

39:38.020 --> 39:40.944
Me, too. I grew up
in cattle country.

39:41.020 --> 39:43.546
You ride Western or English?

39:44.620 --> 39:45.746
Both.

39:49.020 --> 39:50.306
What you looking for?

39:50.380 --> 39:51.825
My medicine.

39:53.860 --> 39:56.784
Oh, look. Isn't this awful?

39:56.860 --> 39:58.988
You just dial a number,

39:59.060 --> 40:01.062
and then a girl shows up
at your hotel room.

40:01.140 --> 40:03.746
It's like ordering Chinese.

40:03.820 --> 40:05.868
Sometimes literally.

40:05.940 --> 40:09.342
Can't you see how young she is?

40:09.420 --> 40:11.627
This probably isn't even
the actual girl,

40:11.700 --> 40:13.429
if it makes you feel any better.

40:13.500 --> 40:15.343
A lot of the time,
these pictures are fake.

40:15.420 --> 40:18.185
It's a completely different girl
that shows up at your room,

40:18.260 --> 40:20.866
let me tell ya'...
I hear, from a source.

40:29.260 --> 40:32.230
- Oh, my gosh.
- You all right?

40:32.300 --> 40:34.780
I only have six pills left.
I thought I brought more.

40:34.860 --> 40:36.749
Six is a lot of pills, Lamb.

40:36.820 --> 40:38.948
Six is nothing.

40:39.020 --> 40:43.344
There's gotta be a 24-hour
pharmacy or something, right?

40:43.420 --> 40:46.629
<i>Vegas is a 24-hour pharmacy.
You're gonna be okay.</i>

40:46.700 --> 40:50.182
Just relax.
We'll get something later.

40:50.260 --> 40:52.262
Okay.

41:08.500 --> 41:11.071
You look like Santa Claus,

41:11.140 --> 41:14.030
but just, like, thinner...

41:14.100 --> 41:16.501
and hotter.

41:16.580 --> 41:19.663
Ya' know, I prayed for
an Easy Bake oven

41:19.740 --> 41:22.744
when I was a little girl;
I never got it, Santa.

41:28.300 --> 41:31.509
Okay, I can't find your mouth.

41:31.580 --> 41:34.584
<i>So...</i>

41:34.660 --> 41:38.301
tell me about your family.

41:40.740 --> 41:43.471
I had enough counseling
in the hospital.

41:43.540 --> 41:45.861
<i>I'm on a couch with a man,</i>

41:45.940 --> 41:48.102
<i>and both my feet are off the floor.</i>

41:48.180 --> 41:50.308
<i>I mean, yeah, it's because
my stupid body is failing me,</i>

41:50.380 --> 41:52.109
<i>but still, I'm a slut.</i>

41:55.820 --> 41:58.300
Loray says you're
her only family.

41:58.380 --> 42:01.270
- Loray said that about me?
- Yeah.

42:03.540 --> 42:05.941
Loray does have family
down in Orlando.

42:06.020 --> 42:09.706
She's got a little sister that
she basically raised herself,

42:09.780 --> 42:11.066
because, you know...

42:11.180 --> 42:12.944
you can see she's a caretaker still.

42:13.020 --> 42:15.307
People are like that, aren't they?

42:15.380 --> 42:17.109
She's got a nephew
she ain't even met.

42:17.180 --> 42:19.626
I think he's, like,
two or three years old.

42:19.700 --> 42:22.101
I'm not really good
with kid-type stuff.

42:22.180 --> 42:25.309
Anyway, I keep saying to her
she needs to go down there

42:25.380 --> 42:27.781
and reconnect,
'cause family's family.

42:27.860 --> 42:30.306
If you got that stuff,
you need to...

42:30.380 --> 42:33.543
but I think, for her,
it's very painful.

42:33.660 --> 42:37.346
- Hey!
- Hey!

42:37.420 --> 42:40.151
You guys, you have to
come downstairs immediately.

42:40.220 --> 42:43.269
Some people are line dancing...

42:43.340 --> 42:46.264
...as a joke.
- As a joke, they're line dancing?

42:46.380 --> 42:49.031
Well, this is brilliant. Let's get NASA
on the phone. Someone call CNN.

42:49.100 --> 42:50.989
She's resting.

42:51.060 --> 42:53.062
No, no, I'm fine.
I'm feeling much better.

42:53.180 --> 42:56.502
- Were you guys talkin' about me?
- Yeah, we were, actually.

42:56.580 --> 42:58.469
We were having
a conversation entitled,

42:58.540 --> 43:01.111
"Third Wheels of the World
Who Ruin People's Vibes,"

43:01.180 --> 43:03.262
and your name came...
No, we weren't talking about you.

43:03.340 --> 43:06.264
Why don't you talk about me?

43:15.180 --> 43:17.660
She does this every time.

43:17.740 --> 43:21.745
We get it, girl. You can put
your whole vagina on the floor.

43:21.820 --> 43:23.788
Okay, all right, that's enough.

43:23.860 --> 43:26.625
Loray, the truck is outside.

43:26.700 --> 43:29.021
The special truck
that delivers the food

43:29.100 --> 43:31.706
to the tummies of the drunk girls.

43:31.780 --> 43:34.465
Yes. Hey, let's go and fill
Loray's little tummy.

43:34.540 --> 43:37.305
- I love food so much. I love it.
- Everybody loves food.

43:37.380 --> 43:39.906
I love it, I love it.

43:41.460 --> 43:44.066
You're so cute, you little--

43:44.140 --> 43:45.824
Okay, well done.

43:45.940 --> 43:48.181
Sorry. Sorry about the damage.
Here she goes.

43:48.260 --> 43:50.786
I need it. I need that.

43:51.860 --> 43:53.749
You can keep that hat.

43:55.460 --> 43:56.825
Okay, so listen,

43:56.900 --> 44:00.109
we've done drinking and gambling,

44:00.180 --> 44:02.626
you've been dancing
with, what is it you call them?

44:02.700 --> 44:04.225
- Sodomites.
- Sodomites.

44:04.300 --> 44:05.950
Love that word, love that word.

44:06.020 --> 44:08.307
And I failed at all three.

44:08.420 --> 44:09.990
No, don't say that. You were great.

44:10.060 --> 44:12.301
Oh, but look.

44:12.380 --> 44:14.303
- Wow. Brilliant.
- Petty theft.

44:14.380 --> 44:16.428
That's one of mine.
Where did you get that?

44:16.500 --> 44:19.265
- She nicked that from the bar, Loray.
- Okay, so what's next?

44:19.340 --> 44:22.742
Because I am
such a nice person,

44:22.820 --> 44:24.549
everyone passed this around,

44:24.620 --> 44:26.304
and wrote down naughty things

44:26.380 --> 44:29.304
they thought you should try.

44:31.180 --> 44:34.309
- We can do some of that?
- Oh, yeah.

44:47.700 --> 44:49.987
- All done.
- You whore.

44:51.020 --> 44:52.385
Are you sure this is illegal?

44:54.420 --> 44:57.071
Oi, you girls finished pissing?

44:57.180 --> 44:59.069
Ready?

45:03.380 --> 45:05.144
They try to connect the holes.

45:05.220 --> 45:07.871
- Oh, my...
- Sorry

45:07.980 --> 45:11.109
You're in luck, Skipper.
I just renewed my license.

45:14.500 --> 45:17.504
Gosh, it's so short.

45:17.580 --> 45:20.231
Feels so light.

45:20.300 --> 45:23.031
Oh, you look totally butch.

45:23.100 --> 45:25.944
Might as well drop you off
at the enlistment center.

45:26.020 --> 45:28.307
Go cop your dope.

45:29.820 --> 45:32.664
Pick-up for Mannerheim.

45:32.740 --> 45:34.708
That's me. Thanks.

45:40.060 --> 45:41.550
Thanks.

45:42.620 --> 45:45.464
What's the matter?
You seem agitated.

45:45.540 --> 45:47.747
Okay, so tell me,
how do I have fun?

45:47.820 --> 45:50.107
'Cause I'm honestly
not having fun yet.

45:50.180 --> 45:52.342
Bars are not fun.

45:52.420 --> 45:54.468
The bar smelled like the flu.

45:54.540 --> 45:57.908
Smelled like the section
at the pet store

45:57.980 --> 45:59.789
where you get turtles.

45:59.860 --> 46:02.067
And that adult magazine,

46:02.140 --> 46:04.063
that was the most
revolting thing that I've ever seen.

46:04.140 --> 46:07.110
It's not fun, William.

46:07.180 --> 46:08.670
Maybe I'm not fun.

46:08.740 --> 46:10.981
No, um...

46:11.060 --> 46:13.381
you are fun.

46:13.460 --> 46:15.781
- Really? You think I'm fun?
- Yeah.

46:15.860 --> 46:17.908
And I'm not alone in that.

46:17.980 --> 46:20.506
This little guy happens to think
you're hilarious, as well,

46:20.580 --> 46:23.026
doesn't he? "No, I don't."
We're not gonna get into that.

46:23.140 --> 46:27.543
Look, I think maybe you've just
not found your thing yet.

46:33.620 --> 46:36.669
Okay, you guys,
now this is fun.

46:36.740 --> 46:38.742
Hey, listen, if you're scared,

46:38.820 --> 46:40.743
we don't have
to do this, you know.

46:40.820 --> 46:43.221
No, no, of course I'm not scared.

46:43.300 --> 46:45.189
This is almost like Disney.

46:45.260 --> 46:47.911
- I'm so excited.
- Again with Disney.

46:47.980 --> 46:50.665
Loray...

46:50.740 --> 46:54.711
- I think you're Type D.
- What the hell is Type D?

46:54.780 --> 46:57.829
You don't know what Type D is?
It means you're depressed.

46:57.900 --> 47:00.062
Or maybe it's just
late on a Tuesday,

47:00.140 --> 47:02.620
and I'm tired of being
your magical Negro.

47:02.700 --> 47:04.304
Um, my what?

47:04.380 --> 47:06.621
- No, no.
- Magical Negro.

47:06.700 --> 47:09.624
Magical Negro
is a narrative convention

47:09.700 --> 47:12.021
in which a black person
uses their special black wisdom

47:12.100 --> 47:13.340
to help a white person in need.

47:13.420 --> 47:15.661
We learned all about it in class.

47:15.740 --> 47:18.141
<i>Ghost, Green Mile,
Bagger Vance.</i>

47:18.220 --> 47:20.143
All magical Negroes.

47:20.220 --> 47:22.302
You aren't a magical Negro,

47:22.380 --> 47:24.382
and if you got so much
special black person wisdom,

47:24.460 --> 47:27.304
how come you just texted your
ex-boyfriend those Carole King lyrics?

47:27.380 --> 47:28.905
I got wisdom.

47:28.980 --> 47:30.744
You haven't got wisdom.
Don't touch me now.

47:32.900 --> 47:34.743
Lamb, don't I say a lot of things

47:34.820 --> 47:37.346
that make you go,
"Wow, Loray just told me.

47:37.420 --> 47:39.468
She's so insightful."

47:39.540 --> 47:41.588
- Yeah, yeah.
- Racism.

47:49.780 --> 47:52.260
Hold steady.
Are you all right, love?

47:52.340 --> 47:53.671
Yeah, I'm fine.

47:53.740 --> 47:56.220
Take it easy.
She's a little banged up.

47:56.300 --> 47:58.871
Ma'am, if you have
a pre-existing medical condition...

47:58.940 --> 48:01.227
...I can't let you ride this thing.
- I'm fine.

48:01.300 --> 48:04.144
I'm fine.
I'm as healthy as a horse.

48:04.220 --> 48:06.063
Which is, of course, very healthy.

48:06.140 --> 48:09.064
I know about that 'cause
I'm an expert in equine matters.

48:09.140 --> 48:12.110
You've never ridden a horse
a day in your life.

48:12.180 --> 48:13.989
I'm ready.

48:49.180 --> 48:51.467
What are you angry
with me for?

48:51.580 --> 48:53.867
- You know why.
- Because of this?

48:53.940 --> 48:55.863
Oh, look, you know I love you,

48:55.940 --> 48:57.783
but you're makin' a play for a girl

48:57.860 --> 49:00.181
who's held together
with Band-Aids and chewing gum.

49:00.260 --> 49:02.149
You've been up her ass all night.

49:02.220 --> 49:04.348
Bringing her here?

49:04.420 --> 49:06.229
You know we'd never be
caught dead doin' this tacky shit,

49:06.300 --> 49:08.223
and all just to defile
some poor girl from the sticks.

49:08.300 --> 49:10.268
- In my defense--
- No!

49:10.340 --> 49:13.628
You are makin' her
feel pretty, and that's cruel.

49:13.700 --> 49:17.022
She is pretty.

49:17.100 --> 49:19.751
She thinks I'm a good guy, Loray.

49:19.820 --> 49:22.346
What a dumb-ass.

49:22.420 --> 49:24.388
No one's thought I was good
since I was 9 years old.

49:24.460 --> 49:26.462
Twelve for me.

49:26.540 --> 49:29.146
That makes more sense.
You are a bit difficult.

49:29.220 --> 49:31.382
I know it sounds weird
coming from me,

49:31.460 --> 49:33.144
but I'd never take
advantage of her, ya' know?

49:33.220 --> 49:35.109
You're right.

49:35.180 --> 49:37.228
It does sound weird
coming from you.

49:37.300 --> 49:38.950
William the Conqueror.

49:39.020 --> 49:40.943
- Bill the Butcher.
- Slick Willie.

49:41.020 --> 49:43.830
You lovers ready to go?

49:43.900 --> 49:46.949
Oh, gag me.

49:50.100 --> 49:53.309
I don't know how I let you guys
talk me into this!

50:00.900 --> 50:03.426
Hey, you okay?

50:03.500 --> 50:06.390
Yeah. I'm fabulous.

50:06.460 --> 50:09.031
So, what's next?

50:09.100 --> 50:11.387
Oh, my God.
You're bleeding. She's bleeding.

50:11.460 --> 50:13.781
Whoa! Hey, what happened?

50:13.860 --> 50:15.624
I'm fine. It's just my skin graft.

50:15.700 --> 50:17.384
Skin graft? That sounds
like something that should

50:17.500 --> 50:19.264
be dealt with in a hospital.

50:19.340 --> 50:21.661
No. No hospitals.

50:21.740 --> 50:24.061
I'm having fun.

50:24.140 --> 50:26.586
I'm having fun in Sin City.

50:26.660 --> 50:28.310
You guys, I'm fine.

50:28.380 --> 50:29.905
Lamb, don't be embarrassed.

50:29.980 --> 50:31.982
Let's just go to a clinic or a hospital,

50:32.060 --> 50:34.188
and take it easy for a couple of hours.

50:34.260 --> 50:36.661
I'm tired of taking it easy.

50:36.740 --> 50:39.061
All I do is take it easy.

50:39.140 --> 50:41.381
I can't stop taking those stupid pills.

50:41.460 --> 50:43.064
I feel like I'm dying.

50:43.140 --> 50:45.507
We're all dying on a cellular level.

50:45.580 --> 50:47.662
My goodness, I never
thought about it that way.

50:47.780 --> 50:50.067
- You're so wise.
- Okay, we're getting a bit distracted.

50:50.140 --> 50:51.710
We've had enough fun tonight.

50:51.780 --> 50:53.987
Let's take care for a little while.

50:54.060 --> 50:56.222
No. All anybody wants to do
is take care of me. I'm sick of it.

50:56.300 --> 50:58.621
You know what?
You're lucky, Lamb.

50:58.700 --> 51:01.670
Look, I know you resent
the way you were raised,

51:01.740 --> 51:03.151
all the church stuff and everything.

51:03.220 --> 51:05.109
But there are worse things than being

51:05.180 --> 51:08.548
a perky, privileged little blonde
with saviors everywhere.

51:08.620 --> 51:12.511
At least people care where you go.

51:12.580 --> 51:15.231
Your mama's probably
looking for you right now.

51:15.300 --> 51:18.224
Nobody's looked for me in years.

51:18.300 --> 51:21.349
Hell, last time
somebody Googled me,

51:21.420 --> 51:23.070
there was no Google.

51:23.140 --> 51:24.471
They had to Alta Vista that shit.

51:24.540 --> 51:28.625
That's a lie. William said...

51:28.700 --> 51:30.862
William said that you had family,
and they miss you.

51:30.940 --> 51:34.467
He did, did he?
Well, this isn't about me.

51:34.540 --> 51:37.384
Look, I didn't come here
to be coddled,

51:37.460 --> 51:40.623
and be treated like I'm
some kind of fragile thing.

51:40.700 --> 51:43.021
- Seriously?
- I'm just trying to connect with her.

51:43.100 --> 51:45.102
- Shall we talk about this now?
- Connect?

51:45.180 --> 51:47.103
I'm staying out, and I'm gonna
party my butt off,

51:47.180 --> 51:48.944
whether you guys like it or not.

51:49.020 --> 51:52.627
Hey, listen, I know we've
upset you, but can you not go?

51:52.700 --> 51:54.748
I don't want you to be alone
in this city. I wanna take care of you.

51:54.820 --> 51:56.345
Thank you for everything.

51:56.420 --> 51:57.751
I'm not gonna be
your burden anymore.

51:57.820 --> 52:00.630
Lamb? Lamb.

52:02.500 --> 52:04.184
Brilliant idea you had,
bringin' her here.

52:04.260 --> 52:06.103
- It's your fault.
- My fault?

52:06.180 --> 52:08.182
"Dying on a cellular level"?
What does that even mean?

52:12.660 --> 52:14.708
<i>The night is still young,</i>

52:14.780 --> 52:18.626
<i>and I can't let some minor bleeding
keep me from major depravity.</i>

52:18.700 --> 52:20.668
Phenomenal.

52:20.740 --> 52:24.028
<i>Chalet, prepare
to get Mannerheimed.</i>

52:33.500 --> 52:35.343
Free shots.

52:39.700 --> 52:41.623
Take one.

52:45.380 --> 52:47.542
Shots here.

53:06.860 --> 53:09.784
I like it.
Show me a little more.

53:12.140 --> 53:14.541
<i>Shots, shots, shots!</i>

53:17.060 --> 53:19.711
Hey. Hey, Blondie.

53:19.780 --> 53:23.102
- Come and sit with us.
- You wanna sit down?

53:24.180 --> 53:26.023
Actually, I'll just take this.

53:29.580 --> 53:31.742
Have another shot.

54:14.060 --> 54:16.347
You got something
on your face, babe.

54:19.820 --> 54:21.709
Stop.

54:27.700 --> 54:29.509
Honey, something is on your face.

54:29.580 --> 54:31.662
I have no idea what that is.

54:31.740 --> 54:33.868
What is that?
Where you goin'?

54:33.940 --> 54:36.181
You need to wash your face.

54:44.380 --> 54:47.111
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up.

54:47.180 --> 54:49.865
This is V.I.P., baby.
You got a V.I.P.?

54:49.980 --> 54:53.427
I'm disabled.

55:38.100 --> 55:40.228
You aren't gonna O.D., are you?

55:42.620 --> 55:47.626
Why does this always
happen to me? Oh!

55:49.700 --> 55:51.589
Wait, no, I need them.

55:51.660 --> 55:55.585
I know, I know. Hydros?
That's not a bad way to go.

56:03.860 --> 56:05.862
All right.

56:07.740 --> 56:10.710
Wow! Where do you
buy your hair?

56:10.780 --> 56:12.669
Is it human?

56:12.740 --> 56:15.027
It's a miracle.

56:15.100 --> 56:17.671
It's really thick.

56:17.740 --> 56:19.708
No, you're...

56:19.820 --> 56:21.345
you're Amber.

56:21.420 --> 56:23.661
Do we know each other?

56:29.700 --> 56:31.862
I can't believe it's you.

56:31.940 --> 56:35.945
You're...
you're a magical prostitute.

56:36.020 --> 56:37.021
Bye.

56:37.100 --> 56:40.821
No, no, you don't understand.
It's a miracle.

56:40.900 --> 56:43.380
Mm-hmm.

56:43.460 --> 56:46.543
Please, just, uh,
just stay here and talk to me.

56:46.620 --> 56:48.031
Please.

56:49.740 --> 56:51.151
I'll pay you.

56:55.060 --> 56:56.505
Well, she's gone.

56:56.580 --> 56:58.708
Go and get her.

56:58.780 --> 57:00.908
How am I supposed to do that?

57:00.980 --> 57:03.950
She's been swallowed up
by the Vegas night, hasn't she?

57:04.020 --> 57:06.546
I think
I might know where she is.

57:06.620 --> 57:09.305
Honestly?

57:09.380 --> 57:12.065
Unfortunately, yeah.

57:12.140 --> 57:15.428
Yeah, but why would you tell me?

57:15.540 --> 57:17.383
You've been trying
to get us separate all night.

57:17.500 --> 57:19.264
You don't trust me, do you?

57:21.660 --> 57:25.107
Remember that time
I got food poisoning at work,

57:25.180 --> 57:28.184
and you guarded the entrance
to the women's bathroom

57:28.260 --> 57:30.740
for, like, three hours?

57:30.820 --> 57:33.426
The memory will never leave me.

57:33.500 --> 57:35.901
And that time I needed someone

57:36.020 --> 57:39.183
to go with me to my
junior thesis screening,

57:39.260 --> 57:42.184
and you came and pretended
to be my brother?

57:42.260 --> 57:45.184
Yeah, I do. I was very convincing
in the role of Derek.

57:47.180 --> 57:50.946
Look, what I'm saying is,

57:51.020 --> 57:53.148
I know you're a total creeper.

57:54.700 --> 57:56.668
But just this once,

57:56.740 --> 57:59.220
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.

58:01.460 --> 58:03.986
- So this is nice.
Uh-huh.

58:05.620 --> 58:08.100
You need a mint.

58:08.220 --> 58:12.464
This'll wake you up.
Here. Gratis.

58:12.540 --> 58:15.066
Occupied.

58:18.780 --> 58:20.464
What happened to you?

58:23.220 --> 58:25.666
Um, well...

58:28.020 --> 58:30.227
I was in a plane that went down.

58:33.340 --> 58:35.468
The boy who was courting me--

58:35.580 --> 58:38.186
my fiancÃ©,
I'd reckon you'd call him--

58:38.260 --> 58:41.742
he was a pilot in the Air Force.

58:41.820 --> 58:46.951
Normally, our dates
were chaperoned by our parents,

58:47.020 --> 58:49.102
but he wanted to take me
up in his plane,

58:49.180 --> 58:51.786
and it only had two seats,

58:51.860 --> 58:55.706
so my parents were willing
to make an exception,

58:55.780 --> 58:57.669
just once.

58:57.740 --> 59:01.540
He was a good pilot, but...

59:03.220 --> 59:05.507
Did he get as messed up as you,

59:05.580 --> 59:07.708
all that shit on your neck?

59:11.260 --> 59:13.547
He lucked out.

59:13.660 --> 59:16.630
- Not a scratch, huh?
- No, he died.

59:24.140 --> 59:25.426
Amber...

59:25.500 --> 59:28.583
I can't go back to Montana.

59:28.660 --> 59:30.742
I've destroyed everything,

59:30.820 --> 59:33.471
and I thought I could
live in a godless world,

59:33.540 --> 59:37.545
but this is not what I expected.

59:37.620 --> 59:40.385
This is so much worse than home.

59:40.460 --> 59:43.543
Ha! Nothing's worse than home.

59:43.620 --> 59:45.190
Trust me.

59:45.260 --> 59:48.309
I'm scarred for life. No offense.

01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:13.824
Um, I said 100.

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:16.949
I know. It's a couple of
thousand in cash.

01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:20.263
You know what?

01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:22.069
I'm gonna write you a check, too.

01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:26.270
I know you professionals
probably can't take checks,

01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:29.344
but I'm good for it, I swear.

01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:33.829
Is this a joke?

01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:36.870
There was a problem
with the plane.

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:39.625
Major mechanical failure.

01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:42.670
My family... well,
my family and Micah's family,

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:44.788
we sued, and we won.

01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:52.062
I'm worth, like, millions of dollars.

01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:55.781
I was supposed to give
a lot of it to my church.

01:00:55.860 --> 01:01:00.468
They were expecting a big
announcement on Sunday, and then...

01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:06.104
well, it didn't really go
the way that they planned.

01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:11.345
I think I have better ideas for it.

01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:15.870
Yeah, yeah, I would...

01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:19.945
say this is a real stroke of genius.

01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:28.026
I have been so angry

01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:30.182
at everyone.

01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:33.781
Mostly God.

01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:37.342
Is this a TV show?

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:42.588
Do they have TV shows like this?

01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:48.107
Wow. Wow.

01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:50.547
Oh, man, I'm gonna
buy a bunch of stuff

01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:52.622
for my boys.

01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:56.591
My one son, it's his birthday
next week, the same as mine.

01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:59.869
He must have been a great gift.

01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:02.227
Yeah.

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:03.745
How did you know my name?

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:05.584
I recognized you from the card.

01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:10.590
You know, the card that
they hand out on the street.

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:14.984
I know, it's crazy.
What are the odds?

01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:17.791
It's like plane crash odds.

01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:20.306
I...

01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:22.223
You... Wait a minute.

01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:25.588
You recognized me
from that picture?

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:28.869
That's, like, ten years ago.
I was a kid.

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:31.790
You're the same person.

01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:35.463
No, I'm not.

01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:39.467
Yes, you are.

01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:42.829
Yes, you are.

01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:45.790
- Okay.
- It's still you.

01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:49.307
Okay. It's still me.

01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:52.663
Those are real, ya' know?

01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:58.670
Amber, you are fearfully
and wonderfully made.

01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:47.706
You found me.

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:15.865
Feels like Christmas now.

01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:18.341
Yeah, that snow was a surprise.

01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:20.343
I wasn't expecting that at all.

01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:22.866
I wasn't even talking about the snow.

01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:24.544
Loray!

01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:27.783
- I'm so sorry.
- You went ghost on us.

01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:30.989
I'm sorry I went ghost on you.

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:34.741
You small-town people sure like
to lay on the physical affection.

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:36.390
What is this?

01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:39.270
Anthrax, probably.

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:43.470
Magical, sparkly
anthrax from fairyland.

01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:45.349
How did you guys know where I was?

01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:47.900
We're people who live
in the world who know people.

01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:50.586
I spoke to my friend Jorge,
he works here.

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:53.061
He said he saw
a blood-soaked blonde

01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:55.746
staggering into Chalet,
put two and two together.

01:04:57.540 --> 01:04:59.463
Well, you didn't
have to come after me.

01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:01.702
He insisted.

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:04.181
Hey, listen,
I'm gonna get some ice

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:06.621
for that beautiful little shoulder.

01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:08.225
Try not to do anything weird.

01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:10.428
Ow! That's my favorite arm.

01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:14.465
Hey, look, I gotta go.

01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:16.827
I'm workin' Beatles Brunch later.

01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:20.308
There's gonna be a lot of
half-priced mimosas,

01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:23.987
and idiots who don't even know
about George's solo stuff, so...

01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:27.990
You all squared away here?

01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:31.269
Yeah, I think so.

01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:33.991
Loray, thank you

01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:36.267
for a wonderful tour of Vegas.

01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:40.945
And thank you for
being worried about me.

01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:45.942
I think I'm ready
to go see the real world now.

01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:49.388
You're goin', huh?

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:51.906
Yeah, I didn't think

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:53.982
you would settle for
the half-scale version.

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:57.024
- You're too smart.
- What about you?

01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:00.387
What about me?

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:02.428
Why don't you try to get that degree,

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:05.026
get out of Las Vegas, like you said?

01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:07.102
Where am I supposed to go?

01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:09.103
What about Florida?

01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:10.750
See that sister of yours.

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:13.471
Florida.

01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:18.102
Florida.

01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:21.070
Yeah, I told ya',

01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:24.462
there's stuff there
I don't wanna face.

01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:30.865
Well, there's stuff here
I don't wanna face,

01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:33.307
but I'm doing it,

01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:36.303
even if it hurts.

01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:41.145
You always make things
sound so simple.

01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:46.068
Think I'll home-school my kid.

01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:50.703
I think I'll take that as a compliment.

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:55.190
I wanna give you my phone number,

01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:57.342
in case you ever wanna,

01:06:57.420 --> 01:07:00.026
<i>you know...</i>

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:02.467
- ...explore.
- Yeah, oh, okay.

01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:04.907
You're squishin' my cotton candy.

01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:09.471
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:15.102
Hey, see you in the trenches.

01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:16.830
When are you working?

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:20.143
Same time as you.
I'll be your Ringo.

01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:22.427
Love you.

01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:32.385
She's my mate.

01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:34.383
I know.

01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:49.548
What's with the dishes?

01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:52.385
Just, you know,

01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:54.383
in case I wanna eat something.

01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:56.189
Hotels are notorious
breeding grounds for bacteria.

01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:58.547
Yeah. I hear that

01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:00.702
hotel bedspreads are the worst.

01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:02.270
They never wash 'em,

01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:03.865
so if you shine a black light on there,

01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:05.744
they're completely covered in s...

01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:07.345
cigarette ash.

01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:15.107
- So should we...
- Should we what?

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:18.069
You know what.

01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:22.944
Actually, I don't.

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:26.149
It's, um, it's getting light,
so I'll close the curtains.

01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:28.348
You don't have to look at me.

01:08:31.779 --> 01:08:33.669
Why wouldn't I wanna see you?

01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:39.621
<i>Lamb, um...</i>

01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:41.941
I just came back here

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:44.666
to make sure you got back safe,

01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:46.390
and to tuck you in.

01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:49.066
I don't need to be tucked in.

01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:51.984
It's okay. I know what to do.

01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:54.265
Whoa. No, no, no.

01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:57.867
- No, no, no.
- Why?

01:08:57.939 --> 01:09:00.420
Because it's not right.

01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:08.587
Because I'm hideous, right?

01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:11.903
No. Of course not.

01:09:11.979 --> 01:09:16.144
Do you know that
some people in my church

01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:18.627
think that God punished me?

01:09:21.779 --> 01:09:23.703
Maybe I did deserve it.

01:09:23.779 --> 01:09:26.067
No. No, you don't.

01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:31.305
You are a beautiful young woman
who got hurt, that's all.

01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:34.224
No, they don't want me anymore,
and you don't want me, either.

01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:36.826
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

01:09:36.899 --> 01:09:38.709
I would do crazy things
to you, given a chance.

01:09:38.779 --> 01:09:40.747
- No.
- I would. I would.

01:09:40.819 --> 01:09:42.982
- Under the right circumstances--
- You wouldn't.

01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:45.346
I would. I'd put you
back in intensive care, love.

01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:48.026
Sit down. I'd rip off

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:51.149
these weird,
flesh-colored tight things.

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:53.143
They're surgical support hose.

01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:55.302
Your surgical support hose,

01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:57.701
I'd tie you up with them. Yeah.

01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:03.341
But you're gonna
have to forget about that,

01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:06.867
because you're 21,
and you're new to the world,

01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:09.028
and there are gonna be other guys.

01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:11.182
There should be other guys.

01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:13.706
It shouldn't be like this.

01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:15.385
I won't let it be like this.

01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:19.510
Not at 4:00 a.m.,

01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:20.820
with a bloody arm,

01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:23.631
and with that...

01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:27.500
plaster zebra coldly watching us.

01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:30.868
I can make my own decisions.

01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:32.863
I can take care of myself.

01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:36.228
No, I know. I've noticed.

01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:39.787
You're also pretty good at taking
care of your server, aren't you?

01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:42.591
Yeah?

01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:45.664
So how long you
planning to stay here?

01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:48.311
I don't know.

01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:52.386
I just don't wanna go
back to Blakesley.

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:57.705
Lamb, the world is not
just Blakesley

01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:00.107
or the Vegas strip.

01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:02.706
There are other places
on the continuum.

01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:04.782
It's not just this or that.

01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:09.982
I'm figuring that out.

01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:25.503
So what did happen
in that club, Lamb?

01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:30.110
Well, I went into
a bathroom with a hooker...

01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:33.263
Seriously? Bloody hell,
let me sit down for this.

01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:34.990
Not like that.

01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:37.267
She was the girl from...
Never mind.

01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:39.342
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:41.821
Anyways, I was looking at her,

01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:46.428
and I realized that
everybody has scars,

01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:48.628
not just me.

01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:51.101
Yeah, the world is
full of the walking wounded.

01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:54.627
Exactly. But they don't
get compensated for it.

01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:58.625
Nobody calls them brave,
or an inspiration.

01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:00.782
I'm lucky.

01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:02.942
I have angels everywhere.

01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:05.864
Even in Vegas.

01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:13.391
- So now I know what I wanna do.
- Oh?

01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:16.145
I wanna go see the world,

01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:19.303
and I wanna give away my money.

01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:22.224
Well, that's a bit extreme.

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:24.109
Why don't you try looking
after yourself for a little while...

01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:27.024
No, I've told you, I have
been tended to enough.

01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:36.671
Oh, hey.

01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:38.981
Can you give this to Loray?

01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:41.108
It's for school.

01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:43.421
Ooh, no, no, no. I'm not
getting involved in that.

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:45.707
- Loray hates charity.
- So do I...

01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:47.782
...and I let her take me
on an all-night pity date.

01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:50.340
That's really sweet of you.

01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:52.388
I've gotta tell you, Lamb,

01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:54.542
you are awful at being awful.

01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:58.861
I gave it my best shot.

01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:03.345
What is that?

01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:06.026
That is a chocolate orgasm.

01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:08.501
I've never had one.

01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:10.702
Really?

01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:12.862
Never?

01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:15.546
Not even on your own,
in the bath, by mistake?

01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:17.702
I'm gonna try this.

01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:21.871
Mmm.

01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:25.701
See, I could be bad.

01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:28.511
Yeah. Yeah, you're really naughty.

01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:33.461
You're like a, um,
a confectionery Hitler.

01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:36.225
You gonna do that
all in on your own, are ya'?

01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:38.746
You know, that's what
killed Keith Moon.

01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:45.590
You know what?
You can stop here.

01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:50.271
- Right here?
- Yeah. Thank you.

01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:52.707
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:18.909
Oh, thank God!

01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:25.505
Are you hurt?

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:29.380
NO. Mom, I'm happy-

01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:32.390
I'm happy-

01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:36.229
Is she in pain?

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:39.031
She says she's happy.

01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:42.104
Oh, no.

01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:45.787
What I did in church,

01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:47.624
it was wrong.

01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:51.508
Disrespectful.

01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:56.791
I had a problem with people
shouting their beliefs at me.

01:16:56.860 --> 01:16:59.670
But then I went and did
the same thing in turn.

01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:03.711
Everyone understands that
you've been through a trial.

01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:06.545
They must've been upset.

01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:09.305
People tried to talk,

01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:12.463
but your mother wouldn't
let 'em get away with it.

01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:14.907
She would defend you
through anything.

01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:16.744
Really, Mom?

01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:19.221
You may not realize this, but, uh...

01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:23.105
I can be a bit of a maverick myself.

01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:25.911
Remember that sermon about
the dangers of yoga,

01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:29.189
and how it suddenly encourages
the worship of false idols?

01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:32.901
Well, I thought
that was a bunch of bunk.

01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:37.543
I went ahead and bought
a yoga DVD, and I've been using it.

01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:40.351
What do you think of that?

01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:43.623
Wow. Good for you, Mom.

01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:47.466
I just changed the positions
a little in my mind.

01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:49.941
Sun salutation
becomes God salutation.

01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:52.546
Down dog is down Satan.

01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:55.031
And so forth.

01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:57.546
We're not stuffy, honey.

01:17:57.620 --> 01:17:59.941
We're open to hearing
about your new beliefs,

01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:02.341
as long as they're
still very conservative.

01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:11.746
Do you guys wanna
watch something?

01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:20.550
I'm surprised you
wanted to see this again.

01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:22.429
I almost threw it in the trash.

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:26.869
That was a special moment.
I won.

01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:29.470
It was a good day.

01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:36.141
The Anderson boy is not
much of a drummer.

01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:41.947
Well, he's not.

01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:50.391
- I'm gonna start singing again.
- That's great.

01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:55.781
As long as you continue
to sing unto the Lord.

01:18:55.860 --> 01:19:00.024
The Christian Lord,
not Buddha or Allah,

01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:02.546
or whomever else
they worship out there.

01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:04.622
That reminds me.

01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:07.385
I got this really cool scarf
on my trip that I want you to have.

01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:09.224
It would look
really great on you, Dad.

01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:11.462
Really?

01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:15.860
Thanks, honey.

01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:18.341
You should wear it to church.

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:20.309
I will.

01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:27.749
Are you leaving again, Lamb?

01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:57.109
<i>William is still at the Hi-Lo.</i>

01:19:57.180 --> 01:19:59.911
<i>I heard he even gets
onstage once in a while.</i>

01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:02.631
<i>I finally got a cell phone,
and we text all the time.</i>

01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:03.946
<i>Smiley face.</i>

01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:14.943
<i>William told Lora y
the money was from</i>

01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:16.909
<i>an anonymous
magical college fund.</i>

01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:19.904
<i>She took it, and now, she has
an internship near her family.</i>

01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:23.063
<i>They live right by Disney World.
Isn't that cool?</i>

01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:34.828
<i>Dad's keffiyeh
sparked a fashion trend</i>

01:20:34.940 --> 01:20:36.908
<i>at Grace Redeemer.</i>

01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:54.271
<i>And me, I'm really different now.</i>

01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:56.468
<i>Yeah, I have better hair,</i>

01:20:56.540 --> 01:20:58.702
<i>but I'm also just better.</i>

01:20:58.780 --> 01:21:01.351
<i>I didn't believe I could be.</i>

01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:04.503
<i>And now, I wanna help
other people get better, too.</i>

01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:07.026
<i>Some folks say
this whole world is broken.</i>

01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:09.467
<i>I say it's paradise.</i>
