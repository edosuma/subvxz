02:24.477 --> 02:25.728
It's me, Seo Woo-jae!

02:29.482 --> 02:30.733
Are you all right?

02:51.462 --> 02:55.008
I just thought there was something wrong.

02:59.929 --> 03:02.891
That's fine. Four meters sound good.

03:02.974 --> 03:04.392
Of course.

03:05.977 --> 03:08.187
Even so…

03:08.271 --> 03:12.233
we will need at least 30 pieces. Yes.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.362
There will be plenty of time.

03:16.446 --> 03:17.780
Of course.

03:32.128 --> 03:33.546
Why do we have to hide?

03:34.213 --> 03:35.423
We did nothing wrong.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.305
I…

04:25.848 --> 04:26.724
I…

04:29.394 --> 04:30.395
Go back.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.898
You never saw me here.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.609

WAVERING WITHOUT THE WIND

-What's taking him so long?
-This is odd.

05:41.424 --> 05:44.427
My goodness. I'm going to kill that jerk.

06:34.310 --> 06:36.896

MARRIAGE VOW

07:17.019 --> 07:21.274
When I went too far away
and lost my way to you

07:22.567 --> 07:24.026
and when I couldn't see

07:25.153 --> 07:27.321
any path in the darkness,

07:33.161 --> 07:35.663
you were my guide.

07:38.082 --> 07:40.293
Even if the path to you is bumpy

07:41.127 --> 07:42.795
and is nothing but a torturous hell,

07:44.797 --> 07:47.049
as you still reached out your hand to me,

07:50.386 --> 07:51.762
I vow…

08:09.030 --> 08:11.574
Even if that path is nothing
but a torturous hell,

08:14.076 --> 08:18.206
I vow to spend
the rest of my life with you.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.053
Hui-ju.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.640
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

09:17.723 --> 09:19.517
-I'm good.
-What about your car?

09:19.600 --> 09:21.727
The insurance company took it.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.524
Shouldn't you get checked out first?
Hui-ju!

09:40.037 --> 09:41.622
You're not going to see a doctor?

09:42.206 --> 09:43.291
I'm completely fine.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.043
Then why do you still have a long face?

09:46.627 --> 09:49.046
You didn't hit anyone,
and you can just fix your car.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.464
You drove here many times.

09:50.548 --> 09:53.551
Were you distracted?
How did you crash into the guardrail?

09:56.304 --> 09:57.888
I was running away.

10:03.352 --> 10:05.813
I ran away because
I thought I would cause trouble.

10:06.397 --> 10:09.358
What are you talking about?
You already got in trouble.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.738
I went to her wedding.

10:15.740 --> 10:16.991
Today was that woman's--

10:19.160 --> 10:22.079
You went there looking like that?
Why did you go there?

10:23.247 --> 10:27.585
Did you feel restless because she was
about to have your ex-lover for good?

10:32.256 --> 10:34.050
I thought I was over him.

10:35.593 --> 10:36.927
But I was wrong.

10:40.556 --> 10:42.058
You're driving me nuts.

10:50.232 --> 10:52.902
Answer it. It's your husband.
If you don't…

10:56.530 --> 10:57.615
Hui-ju.

10:58.949 --> 11:00.576
Come on!

11:03.746 --> 11:06.582
Hyeon-seong. It's me, Dong-mi.

11:07.291 --> 11:11.087
Well, I called Hui-ju over
because I wasn't feeling well.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.047
But she got into an accident on her way.

11:14.215 --> 11:16.258
No. It was a minor collision.

11:17.259 --> 11:19.053
Yes. But…

11:20.429 --> 11:23.849
She must have been shocked.
She fell asleep here.

11:24.725 --> 11:25.935
I don't know what to do.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.729
Should I wake her up?

11:31.357 --> 11:34.068
Okay. Then I'll let her sleep some more.

11:34.568 --> 11:37.780
I'll go pick her up. Okay.

11:40.449 --> 11:42.827
-Was that Mom?
-Yes.

11:42.910 --> 11:43.744
Where is she?

11:44.703 --> 11:45.955
She's at Dong-mi's.

11:46.580 --> 11:48.541
Her car is broken.
I'm going to pick her up.

11:52.962 --> 11:55.214
It's nothing serious.
Don't worry. Go to bed.

11:55.297 --> 11:56.882
Is she really at Dong-mi's?

11:56.966 --> 11:59.510
Of course. I'm heading there
to pick her up now.

12:01.303 --> 12:04.306
Li-sa, you probably had
a light meal to lose weight.

12:07.309 --> 12:08.227
Drink it.

12:08.310 --> 12:10.563
You must be
in good shape for your audition.

12:16.610 --> 12:17.570
What is it?

12:22.700 --> 12:25.870
-Sir, I brought some glasses.
-Put them right here.

12:25.953 --> 12:27.955
Right here? All right.

12:30.624 --> 12:33.169
You should keep drinking. Go on.

12:33.252 --> 12:34.962
-Keep drinking.
-Okay.

12:38.215 --> 12:39.383
You can come in.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.511
The bar seems a bit different today.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.054
It's fine. Please come in.

12:47.641 --> 12:48.934
Why don't you smile?

12:49.018 --> 12:51.604
Were you forced to
have the wedding or something?

12:51.687 --> 12:55.024
Hey. Do you even know
that I'm your mother-in-law?

12:55.107 --> 12:58.235
-Goodness. Why don't you smile?
-Hae-won.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.572
-Thank you.
-Why are you so handsome?

13:02.740 --> 13:04.158
No freaking way.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.829
Even so. I don't trust you.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.248
I don't trust

13:12.166 --> 13:14.585
especially handsome men like you.

13:15.127 --> 13:16.921
Those who have a history of leaving

13:17.004 --> 13:20.049
will leave again and again.

13:20.132 --> 13:21.550
I know that.

13:22.843 --> 13:26.847
You. I'm watching you. Okay?

13:26.931 --> 13:30.267
I have my eyes on you! That's right!

13:31.268 --> 13:34.647
Dad. Gosh.

13:36.023 --> 13:38.484
You look like you came
to object to their marriage.

13:42.571 --> 13:46.367
Gosh, no way.
I'm just worried, that's all.

13:46.450 --> 13:48.244
They are starting over.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.663
Wish them luck instead of worrying.

13:52.206 --> 13:54.375
You're right. Thank you.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.508
Drink up, Dad.

14:03.467 --> 14:06.470
Come on, Dad!

14:07.054 --> 14:09.932
Isn't this great? You're so lucky.

14:40.588 --> 14:43.257
It doesn't look nice

14:47.928 --> 14:49.513
Didn't you tell me

14:54.643 --> 14:57.271
How do you feel right now?

15:00.691 --> 15:03.235
I don't feel like this is my place.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.322
Something like that.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.036
Even with Ms. Gu?

15:13.203 --> 15:15.789
I still don't understand why Hae-won…

15:17.333 --> 15:19.043
rushed this whole thing.

15:25.382 --> 15:26.717
She needed to be sure.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.640
That you would keep
the promise you made to her.

15:34.767 --> 15:38.520
It's not love if only one party makes
all the sacrifices and helps the other.

15:44.109 --> 15:45.527
You should go back inside.

15:46.528 --> 15:48.864

Out of the blue. It just happened.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.131
You've got to be kidding me.

16:06.215 --> 16:09.051
There must have been something
that led to the kiss.

16:09.635 --> 16:13.055
I went there. And he saw me.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.098
That's all.

16:15.307 --> 16:16.725
You guys are full of crap.

16:17.518 --> 16:20.771
Whatever. A minor collision.
That's what it is.

16:20.854 --> 16:22.106
Pretend it never happened.

16:23.857 --> 16:27.152
Hui-ju, is your husband
really cheating on you?

16:27.236 --> 16:29.530
So you did it in the heat of the moment?

16:29.613 --> 16:32.282
No. That would've been better, actually.

16:32.366 --> 16:34.159
What's worse than an affair?

16:39.331 --> 16:40.708
That my husband

16:42.167 --> 16:43.919
might know

16:45.212 --> 16:47.506
what I did back then.

16:48.382 --> 16:49.341
You're nuts.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.593
Hey, there's no way.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.513
He still cares about you
knowing what you did?

16:56.056 --> 16:57.766
Men cannot simply do that.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.101
I hope I'm wrong too.

16:59.184 --> 17:02.062
You're wrong. If he had known,
he couldn't have stayed with you.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.399
No. If he'd really known,

17:05.941 --> 17:08.277
that's really crazy then.

17:08.986 --> 17:10.362
But your husband…

17:11.363 --> 17:13.198
Not a chance.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.410
Not unless that bitch told him.

17:16.493 --> 17:20.497
If she did, just deny it. Back then,
your mother-in-law ridiculed you.

17:20.581 --> 17:22.583
And you missed Li-sa who was in England.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.376
Your husband was awful too.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.671
He neglected you as he started
to work for the school foundation.

17:27.755 --> 17:29.173
A lonely, married woman.

17:29.923 --> 17:32.634
It was easy for Woo-jae
to take advantage of you.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.344
You made a mistake, that's all.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.221
He played you. Just say that.

17:40.059 --> 17:40.893
Come on.

17:41.977 --> 17:43.062
Answer me.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.445
Hui-ju, everyone is jealous of your life.

17:52.446 --> 17:53.405
Wake up.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.658
-I know.
-You know?

17:57.826 --> 17:58.952
And you still do that?

17:59.620 --> 18:02.664
He might be confused as he lost
his memories, but how could you…

18:03.165 --> 18:05.709
You said you didn't want it.
You said it was hell.

18:06.710 --> 18:08.921
Why are you making the same mistake?

18:15.803 --> 18:18.931
Your husband is coming to pick you up.
Try not to look like that.

18:19.014 --> 18:21.683
You… Just pretend nothing happened.

18:22.851 --> 18:23.977
I will

18:25.020 --> 18:26.438
because I need to believe it.

18:29.024 --> 18:30.734
<i>The lie…</i>

18:32.402 --> 18:34.905

-Hey. What is with this table?
-She's having mood swings.

18:44.206 --> 18:45.874
What's wrong with this?

18:46.458 --> 18:49.086
The food here is great.

18:49.169 --> 18:51.922
-It's super tasty. That's why I come here.
-It's tasty.

18:52.005 --> 18:55.300
Right? Don't you think
the food here is amazing?

18:55.384 --> 18:56.385
Hey…

19:01.014 --> 19:02.224
You're the best.

19:15.112 --> 19:18.073
Where are you going?
We're leaving soon. Let's leave together.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.617
Don't do that.
You should stay and have more fun.

19:21.201 --> 19:22.077
Sleep over tonight.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.329
I have a house.
Why would I sleep at yours?

19:25.164 --> 19:26.874
I have plenty of time until the bus comes.

19:26.957 --> 19:28.667
My God, you're so stubborn.

19:30.919 --> 19:32.629
And you take that from me.

19:33.380 --> 19:36.675
You're doing everything
you want to do. Right?

19:38.051 --> 19:40.095
Yes. Almost.

19:40.679 --> 19:41.847
What else is left?

19:41.930 --> 19:44.558
We're going on our honeymoon
to the Cliffs of Moher.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.186
Where's that?

19:47.269 --> 19:51.315
The cliffs are so high that no one
could find you if you fell from them.

19:51.398 --> 19:53.942
Gosh. Why would you go there?
That sounds dangerous.

19:55.360 --> 19:59.031
-Hey. My daddy is leaving.
-Goodness.

19:59.114 --> 20:00.407
Hey…

20:01.658 --> 20:05.162
Oh, my. When will she grow up?

20:05.245 --> 20:06.955
She's the one having the most fun.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.541
-That hurts.
-Okay.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.543
That hurts.

20:12.169 --> 20:14.296
Go take care of that, instead of me.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.424
-Mom.
-All right.

20:18.008 --> 20:19.551
Thanks.

20:20.677 --> 20:23.680
-Hey, pour me a drink.
-No, I'll bring you water.

20:23.764 --> 20:27.142
Sounds great!
But it'll be better if it's alcohol!

20:28.977 --> 20:30.771
It hurts.

20:54.836 --> 20:57.297
I remember you getting hurt.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.467
What?

21:00.550 --> 21:03.387
That your fingers were
severed from the straw cutter.

21:04.596 --> 21:06.598
So Hae-won stayed with you
for a few weeks.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.767
She did.

21:08.850 --> 21:12.187
I told her to go back,
but she didn't listen.

21:13.438 --> 21:15.357
She even fed me.

21:17.234 --> 21:18.735
You know, my granddaughter

21:19.736 --> 21:21.905
is such a kind soul.

21:22.781 --> 21:24.032
That's when it was.

21:26.618 --> 21:30.330
When that happened,
Hae-won asked me to do something for her.

21:31.915 --> 21:33.041
So,

21:34.251 --> 21:36.753
I took over her lessons.

21:52.686 --> 21:53.937
I'm so tired.

21:54.438 --> 21:56.523
I kept it as simple as possible, but…

21:57.149 --> 21:59.651
I guess people stay together
for all the work they did.

22:04.573 --> 22:06.241
When you were saying your vows,

22:06.325 --> 22:09.328
you sounded like you were
at the confessional, not a wedding.

22:16.084 --> 22:17.419
Take off your coat.

22:23.717 --> 22:25.010
Why couldn't you say it?

22:28.764 --> 22:30.265
You couldn't say the last line.

22:32.100 --> 22:37.105
"I vow to spend
the rest of my life with you."

22:42.861 --> 22:44.112
The word "vow"

22:45.197 --> 22:46.490
was too heavy for me.

22:50.035 --> 22:52.662
If you'd given me a bit more time,
I could have--

22:52.746 --> 22:56.208
Well, you don't have to say it
for it to be a vow.

22:58.627 --> 23:01.505
What we showed in front of the people
is also a promise.

23:08.011 --> 23:09.638
I will keep my vows.

23:11.515 --> 23:16.311
Even if the path is bumpy
and is nothing but a torturous hell,

23:16.394 --> 23:18.897
I will keep my promise that I will spend

23:20.440 --> 23:21.983
the rest of my life with you.

23:49.177 --> 23:50.428
Okay.

23:50.512 --> 23:52.973
My wife needs a car right away.

23:53.056 --> 23:55.183
When can we get the replacement vehicle?

23:56.852 --> 24:00.313
We'd like a vehicle
similar to the one she was driving.

24:00.397 --> 24:02.482
Please have it ready this morning.

24:03.191 --> 24:05.152
Okay. Thank you.

24:09.906 --> 24:11.867
I made an appointment at the hospital.

24:11.950 --> 24:13.201
I said I was fine.

24:13.285 --> 24:16.371
I'm not fine. Look at you.
You couldn't get any sleep.

24:16.454 --> 24:17.706
You might develop symptoms.

24:19.207 --> 24:21.918
The VIP service center…

24:25.589 --> 24:26.756
Are you listening?

24:31.344 --> 24:32.220
Yes.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.056
Honey,

24:36.099 --> 24:39.394
did you visit Hwain Gallery yesterday?

24:40.604 --> 24:43.148
The gallery? No.

24:44.774 --> 24:47.235
I thought it was closed yesterday.
Why do you ask?

24:52.115 --> 24:53.867
Li-sa must have left.

24:53.950 --> 24:56.286
You should go.
Don't let her leave by herself.

24:56.369 --> 24:57.370
Okay.

25:31.655 --> 25:32.948
<i>Unlike others,</i>

25:33.031 --> 25:36.910
<i>Chinese lacquer tree branches
become thin and wither away.</i>

25:37.994 --> 25:39.871
Perhaps it's best for them

25:39.955 --> 25:42.749
to meet their fate
before they turn out that way.

25:56.888 --> 26:00.517
X-RAY IMAGING ROOM
MRI IMAGING ROOM

26:01.101 --> 26:04.229
Get physical therapy too.
Your neck and shoulders must be tense.

26:04.312 --> 26:07.107
I was distracted
and crashed into a guardrail.

26:07.190 --> 26:08.358
It wasn't serious.

26:08.441 --> 26:10.318
Gosh. Hyeon-seong told me you'd say that

26:10.402 --> 26:13.446
and asked me
to make sure you got your treatment

26:13.530 --> 26:14.739
and keep an eye on you.

26:16.783 --> 26:19.369
I got my treatment.
We're all good now, right?

26:19.452 --> 26:20.787
Get back to work.

26:20.870 --> 26:22.122
Right, Hui-ju.

26:22.914 --> 26:25.917
Did you come
to Ms. Gu's wedding yesterday?

26:27.794 --> 26:28.795
Why do you ask?

26:29.796 --> 26:33.216
I saw Li-sa. I just thought
you might have been there too.

26:35.677 --> 26:36.761
Li-sa?

26:42.100 --> 26:43.351
-I'm so sleepy.
-No way.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.395
-Did you do the homework?
-No. I'm doomed.

26:47.522 --> 26:48.857
Give me your phone.

26:48.940 --> 26:50.525
Why? What for?

26:55.322 --> 26:56.740
<i>…a torturous hell,</i>

26:59.326 --> 27:03.330
<i>I vow to spend
the rest of my life with you.</i>

27:04.205 --> 27:05.498
That's all.

27:17.260 --> 27:18.261
Why are you crying?

27:48.917 --> 27:52.253
<i>He fell in love
with someone else for a while.</i>

28:22.659 --> 28:24.911
Why did you invite Li-sa?
What's your angle?

28:30.750 --> 28:32.293
And what are you

28:33.461 --> 28:35.004
plotting with my husband?

28:37.799 --> 28:39.509
What is it that you know?

28:41.261 --> 28:43.096
Now you're interested?

28:43.763 --> 28:44.597
Why?

28:46.349 --> 28:48.476
Are you going through
a hard time these days?

28:49.144 --> 28:51.646
People who are happy
aren't interested in others.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.857
Your life must be ruined

28:53.940 --> 28:57.235
to wonder why life is so unfair,
how other people are doing,

28:57.944 --> 29:00.530
and if you're the only one suffering.

29:02.365 --> 29:05.243
I meant it when I wished you happiness.

29:05.910 --> 29:07.829
And I still hope you live a good life.

29:08.872 --> 29:12.751
That way, you will stop
taking an interest in my life.

29:19.090 --> 29:20.800
I didn't invite Li-sa.

29:23.094 --> 29:25.805
I realized something
during my brief time as a teacher.

29:27.098 --> 29:30.059
Surprisingly,
parents are often the ones who cause

29:30.143 --> 29:31.728
the most pain to their children.

29:33.938 --> 29:37.317
Children are supposed to love
and trust their parents the most.

29:37.400 --> 29:39.694
But kids feel immensely betrayed

29:40.445 --> 29:43.072
by their misspoken words
and wrongful behavior.

29:46.409 --> 29:48.036
Because you know that,

29:48.119 --> 29:50.497
you came to me
instead of going straight to Li-sa.

29:52.081 --> 29:55.919
Because you're afraid to find out
what she might know.

30:01.049 --> 30:03.176
And as for what I know,

30:03.968 --> 30:06.846
you can ask your husband, Mr. An.

30:08.223 --> 30:09.849
That is if you have the courage.

30:14.437 --> 30:17.273
You don't have to wrap them up.
I'm throwing them out.

30:17.982 --> 30:19.025
All of them?

30:19.108 --> 30:21.486
Yes. They are old photos.
I'll take new ones.

30:21.569 --> 30:23.154
I'll pay the disposal fee.

30:59.482 --> 31:00.483
It's me, Seo Woo-jae!

31:24.549 --> 31:25.758
Ms. Jeong.

31:35.602 --> 31:38.229
It looks like
Ms. Gu is preparing to file a lawsuit

31:38.730 --> 31:41.566
on the infringement of property rights
against Taerim Academy.

31:41.649 --> 31:43.568
As for this matter, Hyeon-seong…

31:45.987 --> 31:47.864
Mr. An should take care of this.

31:48.448 --> 31:51.159
But the tenants already agreed
to our compensation deal.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.286
So it won't be a problem.

31:54.329 --> 31:56.915
She already got fired.
Why is she getting in our way?

31:56.998 --> 31:59.417
Something about that doesn't seem right.

32:00.043 --> 32:03.588
Mr. An made the personal decision
of giving her a letter of recommendation.

32:04.297 --> 32:05.715
Hardly a disciplinary action.

32:07.383 --> 32:10.553
A letter of recommendation?
Where does she work now?

32:10.637 --> 32:12.430
She works at Hwain Gallery.

32:13.556 --> 32:16.017
Her husband is a sculptor
named Seo Woo-jae.

32:16.893 --> 32:18.728
He works with the same gallery.

32:18.811 --> 32:20.229
Seo Woo-jae?

32:21.606 --> 32:24.067
Should I look into
Mr. An and Ms. Gu's relationship?

32:24.150 --> 32:25.151
No.

32:27.278 --> 32:29.697
Look into that guy named Seo Woo-jae
and Hui-ju.

32:30.406 --> 32:32.033
May I ask why?

32:33.284 --> 32:35.495
-She would never do such--
-Hey.

32:35.578 --> 32:39.207
In this world, people who would
never do such a thing end up doing so.

32:39.916 --> 32:42.043
You're a lawyer.
How could you trust people?

32:43.920 --> 32:48.341
Find out what those two are caught up in.

32:49.676 --> 32:53.888
TOP TEN BILLIARD HALL

33:01.229 --> 33:04.691
If this is about Ju-yeong's father,
I have nothing to say to you.

33:05.191 --> 33:06.401
Okay.

33:06.484 --> 33:09.362
I feel more comfortable
talking to Mr. Lee about that.

33:10.488 --> 33:13.157
Then why did you want to meet?
And here of all places?

33:13.741 --> 33:16.619
Did you know that
there had been a fire in the building?

33:16.703 --> 33:17.620
Three times at that.

33:19.789 --> 33:22.583
At first, they were busy
trying to put out the fire.

33:23.167 --> 33:24.669
And the second time around,

33:24.752 --> 33:27.630
they probably started to wonder
what caused another fire.

33:28.381 --> 33:29.549
But the third time?

33:30.591 --> 33:33.261
It just means that
there is a problem with this building.

33:33.344 --> 33:34.512
What's your point?

33:35.263 --> 33:39.475
You can try to be careful all you want,
but there can always be another fire.

33:41.853 --> 33:43.271
I'll be even more careful then.

33:44.981 --> 33:49.986
My wife asked me
if I had been at your wedding.

33:50.069 --> 33:53.156
You should also be careful,
so there isn't any misunderstanding.

33:53.239 --> 33:56.409
I knew it.
So she came to my wedding after all.

33:59.370 --> 34:02.415
Too bad. It could have been interesting.

34:04.167 --> 34:05.376
What's so interesting?

34:07.295 --> 34:09.630
The groom running off with another woman.

34:11.507 --> 34:15.595
Then I could have acted like the most
heartbroken bride in front of everyone.

34:20.349 --> 34:22.560
Back then, we just tried
to go abroad to study.

34:22.643 --> 34:25.605
Our marriage was a formality,
so no one knew about it.

34:26.189 --> 34:28.399
But since it's official,
I can say things like,

34:28.983 --> 34:31.486
"Thief! Catch that groom-thief!"

34:31.569 --> 34:33.529
I can make accusations now.

34:36.657 --> 34:37.950
I guess

34:38.034 --> 34:41.454
he wouldn't be able to run away from me
on a whim like that anymore.

34:42.371 --> 34:45.708
We're now responsible
to do our duties as a married couple.

34:45.792 --> 34:49.128
Even if he wants to break up, he must
go through a process called divorce.

34:50.004 --> 34:51.130
Sorry to interrupt.

34:52.632 --> 34:56.803
I don't have time
to listen to your petty delusions.

34:57.678 --> 34:58.888
Hui-ju

35:00.139 --> 35:02.183
is curious about what I know.

35:08.564 --> 35:10.024
I guess Hui-ju doesn't know

35:10.942 --> 35:13.236
about Woo-jae's accident
and the relationship

35:14.028 --> 35:15.655
between you and Woo-jae.

35:24.288 --> 35:25.414
Didn't I tell you?

35:26.874 --> 35:29.585
What happened to Mr. Seo
was just an accident.

35:30.878 --> 35:34.340
He was drunk and walking on the road,
so he was more at fault.

35:34.423 --> 35:36.592
I reported the accident
and got him treated.

35:36.676 --> 35:40.012
I just couldn't find any documents
to identify who he was.

35:40.096 --> 35:41.931
When I asked you about this before,

35:42.014 --> 35:44.600
that was the same answer you gave me.
To the word exactly.

35:45.226 --> 35:46.769
Like a well-memorized line.

35:51.065 --> 35:52.608
Well, that's the truth.

35:52.692 --> 35:54.026
How much of it is true?

35:54.944 --> 35:59.115
Omitting some parts to the story
is the same as lying.

36:06.205 --> 36:09.500
TO THE WORLD WITH YOUR DREAMS FROM TAERIM

36:15.339 --> 36:17.049
Your wife wants to see me.

36:19.302 --> 36:20.219
Now?

36:20.303 --> 36:22.638
Yes. How should I handle this?

36:24.473 --> 36:25.558
Go meet her.

36:26.184 --> 36:27.435
Whatever she asks,

36:30.062 --> 36:32.356
just tell her the truth
as far as you know.

36:40.198 --> 36:41.741
<i>It was an accident?</i>

36:42.325 --> 36:45.912
So you two got into the accident
during the business trip?

36:45.995 --> 36:49.207
It was a narrow two-lane road
without street lamps or sidewalks.

36:49.290 --> 36:50.791
And we weren't speeding.

36:51.375 --> 36:54.128
The blood-alcohol level
of the victim was very high.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.505
As he was an undocumented alien
without any ID,

36:56.589 --> 36:58.799
Mr. An paid for the medical bills.

36:58.883 --> 37:00.927
until family showed up to discharge him,

37:02.303 --> 37:04.180
And his family was…

37:04.263 --> 37:06.849
On paper, it was Ms. Gu Hae-won.

37:06.933 --> 37:08.935
But her travel logs didn't add up.

37:09.018 --> 37:13.689
A clueless international student was paid
to pretend to be his family.

37:14.440 --> 37:16.025
Legally speaking,

37:16.108 --> 37:18.569
it won't be a problem
to Mr. An or the foundation.

37:20.363 --> 37:21.530
Of course not.

37:22.323 --> 37:24.659
Car accidents can happen anywhere.

37:26.285 --> 37:29.247
It only makes sense to believe that.

37:43.844 --> 37:45.763
AGREEMENT

37:52.228 --> 37:54.897
Mr. Lee Il-seong was transferred
to a detention facility yesterday.

37:56.941 --> 38:00.152
As it's a special assault case,
he can't get out unless we settle.

38:00.945 --> 38:03.239
If he gets lucky,
he might get off with a fine.

38:03.322 --> 38:06.033
But he might just serve time
instead of paying the fine.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.661
Then Ju-yeong will end up in foster care.

38:09.495 --> 38:11.247
Why must an innocent kid suffer?

38:11.330 --> 38:13.749
I think it's better for him

38:13.833 --> 38:17.253
to at least fight
than to get out with nothing.

38:17.336 --> 38:18.337
Ms. Gu.

38:19.046 --> 38:22.341
Wait, no. You're not
even a teacher at the school.

38:24.093 --> 38:27.513
They are practically strangers.
Why are you going this far to help them?

38:27.596 --> 38:30.683
You made them hold out this long.
Is it your sense of responsibility?

38:31.267 --> 38:33.102
Have you heard of good deeds?

38:35.855 --> 38:37.398
Let's be honest.

38:37.481 --> 38:40.609
You're only calling it that
when this is about you being greedy.

38:41.986 --> 38:45.031
So you're turning this into
a class-action suit. What are you after?

38:46.073 --> 38:47.325
Screwing Taerim over?

38:48.367 --> 38:49.410
Can't I?

38:51.620 --> 38:55.124
We're already collecting memoranda
from the tenants that they won't sue us.

38:57.835 --> 39:00.546
Then I can claim
that they only signed the papers

39:00.629 --> 39:03.549
as they were afraid
they wouldn't be compensated.

39:04.133 --> 39:08.054
And the judge will evaluate if
the memoranda are legally binding or not.

39:11.515 --> 39:14.185
Anyway, I'll pass this along to Mr. Lee.

39:15.144 --> 39:16.604
Sligo General Hospital.

39:19.190 --> 39:21.025
Mr. Seo was hospitalized there. Right?

39:23.027 --> 39:27.490
Ms. Gu. It looks like you and Mr. An
have been involved here and there.

39:29.367 --> 39:33.204
That's funny. I talked about that
with Mr. An before I met you.

39:36.540 --> 39:39.460
What? You didn't know?

39:40.961 --> 39:45.633
I guess he hasn't accepted you as family
whom he can trust and rely on fully.

39:50.888 --> 39:55.226
Perhaps you and I
have similar goals in mind.

39:57.353 --> 39:58.562
See you around.

40:28.509 --> 40:30.678
DIRECTOR LEE JEONG-EUN

40:32.388 --> 40:33.556
Hello, Ms. Lee.

40:33.639 --> 40:34.515
<i>Mr. Seo.</i>

40:34.598 --> 40:37.685
Are you available tomorrow
for a meeting regarding Mr. Woo's project?

40:40.896 --> 40:43.065
Ms. Jeong is coming, right?

40:43.149 --> 40:44.150
<i>Yes.</i>

40:45.901 --> 40:47.153
Okay.

40:50.698 --> 40:51.574

41:57.181 --> 42:02.311
SEO WOO-JAE

42:09.151 --> 42:10.069
<i>Yes?</i>

42:12.655 --> 42:14.323
Where are you now?

42:22.498 --> 42:24.333
Could we meet for a bit?

42:26.252 --> 42:29.171
Yes. I would like to see you.

42:30.506 --> 42:31.757
Where are you?

42:32.341 --> 42:34.009
I'm in front of your studio.

42:35.135 --> 42:36.136
What?

43:02.871 --> 43:04.999
So we're having
meetings starting tomorrow.

43:07.334 --> 43:11.880
I thought it would be more uncomfortable
if we didn't clear the air.

43:14.633 --> 43:17.011
I think I've told you this once before.

43:21.724 --> 43:23.017
What happened yesterday…

43:26.729 --> 43:28.606
It's understandable.

43:30.024 --> 43:31.817
Weddings make people do crazy things.

43:32.818 --> 43:35.487
I understand the feeling
of wanting to break free.

43:36.989 --> 43:40.659
So what happened yesterday
was a mistake and a mere accident.

43:40.743 --> 43:43.120
A mistake. An accident.

43:47.082 --> 43:48.667
Are you sure that's all it was?

43:50.461 --> 43:51.962
It must be.

43:53.255 --> 43:55.549
You've met my husband.

43:55.633 --> 43:57.343
That question is quite insulting.

43:59.011 --> 44:01.138
No. The person who should be more insulted

44:02.014 --> 44:03.557
must be Hae-won, not me.

44:06.018 --> 44:08.896
Yes. I know that.

44:11.065 --> 44:12.733
I know that I'm being irresponsible

44:14.401 --> 44:15.819
for having these emotions…

44:19.615 --> 44:21.200
and behaving this way.

44:21.283 --> 44:23.327
It's not like we were having an affair.

44:24.370 --> 44:26.622
You don't have to tell Hae-won about it.

44:26.705 --> 44:29.458
Sometimes, the truth can be more painful.

44:31.669 --> 44:33.212
So keep it a secret?

44:37.341 --> 44:38.759
Why must I?

44:39.635 --> 44:42.429
Because you already
abandoned Hae-won once before.

44:45.849 --> 44:49.561
And I know how much
Hae-won has changed because of that.

44:51.980 --> 44:55.567
If you turn away from her again,
Hae-won will die.

44:58.153 --> 44:59.738
So she cannot find out.

45:00.614 --> 45:03.033
Pretend it never happened to the end.

45:08.247 --> 45:09.373
Please…

45:11.875 --> 45:13.544
live your own lives.

45:32.980 --> 45:34.690
<i>I needed to believe.</i>

45:35.899 --> 45:38.861
<i>I needed to believe
that you wouldn't let me get hurt.</i>

46:10.517 --> 46:12.895
I definitely saw
the bandages somewhere here.

46:16.565 --> 46:18.400
Forget it. We can buy one outside.

46:18.484 --> 46:19.568
I'm sure I had it here.

46:24.239 --> 46:26.366
Isn't it scary sleeping here alone?

46:26.450 --> 46:28.035
Why? Will you sleep here with me?

46:29.953 --> 46:32.331
I'm comfortable here. It's home.

46:33.916 --> 46:35.876
Did your mom really have an affair?

46:35.959 --> 46:37.794
Your dad could have lied to you.

46:38.670 --> 46:40.964
She probably did. She's not coming back.

46:41.048 --> 46:44.510
My dad gets drunk and fights all the time,
but he still comes home.

46:45.219 --> 46:48.472
But Mom didn't after abandoning me.
So that proves it.

46:49.723 --> 46:51.225
I'm hungry. Let's eat <i>ramyeon</i>.

47:05.614 --> 47:07.115
So you met with Mr. Choi today.

47:08.075 --> 47:10.327
Yes. It turns out the accident happened

47:11.119 --> 47:14.373
when I went back to Ireland
to attend the View Art Fair.

47:14.456 --> 47:17.626
I also booked a business trip there,
so I could go with you then.

47:18.919 --> 47:21.421
Right. You did.

47:21.505 --> 47:24.424
Then why did you say that
at my exhibition?

47:24.508 --> 47:25.801
Say what?

47:25.884 --> 47:28.303
During the opening reception
of my solo exhibition,

47:28.387 --> 47:30.806
you asked me this after seeing Mr. Seo.

47:30.889 --> 47:34.059
Her husband seemed a bit strange.

47:34.643 --> 47:36.311
I heard he had an accident.

47:36.395 --> 47:38.188
Have you heard the details?

47:39.231 --> 47:40.649
Did I say that?

47:43.902 --> 47:45.529
I never thought we'd meet again,

47:45.612 --> 47:47.823
so I must not have thought to tell you.

47:51.952 --> 47:54.204
If you'd told me about this sooner,

47:55.080 --> 47:58.333
I wouldn't have accepted this project
no matter how great

47:58.417 --> 48:00.002
this opportunity may be for me.

48:00.085 --> 48:02.296
I didn't think it through. I'm sorry.

48:02.921 --> 48:05.007
It's all good now that I know.

48:05.090 --> 48:08.635
Once this project is over,
we really don't have to see them again.

48:08.719 --> 48:10.345
Thank you for trusting me.

48:12.055 --> 48:14.308
Of course. And I ought to.

48:16.727 --> 48:20.772
Do you remember when your mother
adamantly disapproved of our marriage?

48:20.856 --> 48:22.357
That's random.

48:22.441 --> 48:24.735
I thought you would give up.

48:24.818 --> 48:28.155
I told you that was
the only time I didn't listen to her

48:28.655 --> 48:29.948
and the best thing I did.

48:31.867 --> 48:34.411
You took the pregnancy test stick from me

48:34.494 --> 48:36.913
and ran to her like
it was some kind of weapon.

48:37.914 --> 48:39.082
I did.

48:40.876 --> 48:42.544
Li-sa was my weapon.

48:48.759 --> 48:50.886
I'm distracting you.
I should let you work.

48:50.969 --> 48:52.929
Just hurry up and finish it.

48:53.013 --> 48:55.641
Thank you for telling me the truth.

48:58.685 --> 49:01.146
<i>Omitting some parts to the story</i>

49:01.897 --> 49:03.398
<i>is the same as lying.</i>

49:18.580 --> 49:19.748
When did you get here?

49:23.251 --> 49:24.127
Where's Mom?

49:25.629 --> 49:26.797
In her studio.

49:27.422 --> 49:30.550
She's worried. Go say hello.
You didn't even see her in the morning.

49:32.469 --> 49:34.012
You've been weird since yesterday.

49:35.639 --> 49:37.099
Do you need to talk to me?

49:43.689 --> 49:46.066
Li-sa, if there's
anything going on at school--

49:46.149 --> 49:47.901
Nothing's going on. I'm hungry.

50:49.671 --> 50:51.590
Woo-jae, you really changed.

50:52.090 --> 50:53.300
Like a different person.

51:02.267 --> 51:03.143
Look at these.

51:04.728 --> 51:06.646
The weather over there isn't good now.

51:06.730 --> 51:10.025
So there's no guarantee
that we'll be able to visit the cliffs.

51:10.108 --> 51:12.110
We should go after your project is over.

51:55.111 --> 51:55.946
Hae-won.

51:57.906 --> 51:58.824
Yes?

52:02.953 --> 52:04.371
Was it a good thing…

52:06.456 --> 52:08.166
for me to come back?

52:15.257 --> 52:16.550
We'll see.

52:18.385 --> 52:22.055
And to be precise, you didn't come back.

52:23.765 --> 52:25.267
I found you.

52:31.898 --> 52:33.650
When will your memories come back?

53:21.740 --> 53:23.116
Who did this to you?

53:25.744 --> 53:27.329
Who did this to you?

53:29.706 --> 53:31.124
Was it Ju-yeong?

53:31.791 --> 53:33.335
Or was it her again? Gu--

53:33.418 --> 53:35.587
I did it. It was an accident.

53:35.670 --> 53:36.504
Get out.

53:48.266 --> 53:51.561
WARNING
THIS BUILDING WILL BE DEMOLISHED

53:53.229 --> 53:54.314
Ju-yeong.

54:02.447 --> 54:03.823
It wasn't here yesterday.

54:03.907 --> 54:06.159
I saw it when I came out
to go to school today.

54:07.619 --> 54:09.162
When will my dad come back?

54:09.245 --> 54:11.331
Actually, I'm on my way to see him now.

54:12.165 --> 54:14.668
Go to school.
Call me when classes are over.

54:14.751 --> 54:18.838
It's dangerous here.
So don't stay here by yourself. Okay?

54:20.173 --> 54:21.049
Okay.

54:28.348 --> 54:32.519
Mr. Lee. We will continue the lawsuit
for infringement of property rights.

54:33.061 --> 54:34.771
But you must get out of there first.

54:35.397 --> 54:37.565
You can't let Ju-yeong be all alone.

54:43.655 --> 54:44.739
Here's the agreement.

54:48.159 --> 54:49.577
AGREEMENT

55:01.798 --> 55:04.759
This is the most money
you will get for compensation.

55:05.719 --> 55:08.221
We could've kicked you out
without giving you anything.

55:08.304 --> 55:11.433
But I feel bad for Ms. Gu
who is trying so hard to help you.

55:14.269 --> 55:16.229
And I'm a father too.

55:30.201 --> 55:32.287
Since Mr. Woo's building
is the main piece,

55:32.370 --> 55:34.247
let's try to make the space stand out.

55:34.330 --> 55:37.584
You can bring out the vivid impression
when the building is in use.

55:38.168 --> 55:40.170
You can convey
the before-demolition energy.

55:41.546 --> 55:44.090
Yes. This would look great too.

55:46.593 --> 55:50.138
I think Hae-won sent you
photos of everything in my studio.

55:50.221 --> 55:51.514
But they are very raw.

55:51.598 --> 55:53.224
I can't present them to people.

55:55.435 --> 55:56.394
I'm sorry I'm late.

55:58.980 --> 56:02.067
You heard, right?
Ms. Gu will be assisting you two.

56:03.193 --> 56:04.944
Depending on how they are installed,

56:05.028 --> 56:07.280
people could have
completely new interpretations.

56:07.363 --> 56:09.908
Since Mr. Seo rarely uses
any colors in his pieces,

56:09.991 --> 56:12.452
should we choose your pieces
that will suit his tone?

56:12.535 --> 56:15.830
Trying to add colors to his pieces
would be a nice challenge.

56:17.957 --> 56:19.667
What do you think, Mr. Seo?

56:21.419 --> 56:24.547
I was trying to express
only one type of emotion in this series.

56:25.256 --> 56:27.884
If I were to use colors,
I'd like to use only one color.

56:28.468 --> 56:32.680
What kind of emotion? How did you feel
when you were planning your piece?

56:36.392 --> 56:38.895
Did you have a specific model
for this piece?

56:39.854 --> 56:40.688
That's--

56:40.772 --> 56:43.525
He looked in the mirror
and posed for himself.

56:44.484 --> 56:47.487
I can see that. It's tall and flat.

56:47.570 --> 56:49.405
This is totally you.

56:49.489 --> 56:52.992
You're good at executing the curves.
You could do one with a woman.

56:54.369 --> 56:55.453
You have a nice model.

56:57.664 --> 57:01.000
He doesn't work with models.
Especially female models.

57:09.634 --> 57:11.261
Why are you drawing me?

57:11.845 --> 57:13.638
Because while I draw you,

57:13.721 --> 57:16.558
I get to look at you as much as I want
no matter how long.

57:34.200 --> 57:38.371
You need to see sculptures in person
to get a feel of the size and texture.

57:38.455 --> 57:40.540
We should go to Mr. Seo's studio together.

57:41.374 --> 57:43.918
Ms. Jeong, you haven't been
to his studio yet. Right?

57:49.090 --> 57:50.592
How about a meal before we go?

57:50.675 --> 57:52.302
There's a new bistro nearby.

57:52.385 --> 57:55.221
I'm sorry. My housekeeper
is leaving early today.

57:55.305 --> 57:57.390
I must go
and prepare dinner for my children.

57:57.474 --> 58:01.978
I just realized that you are
the only one with kids here, Ms. Jeong.

58:04.063 --> 58:05.231
What about you two?

58:07.233 --> 58:09.068
Gosh. What's wrong with me?

58:09.152 --> 58:11.654
I'm getting old too.
I keep asking personal questions.

58:11.738 --> 58:12.697
It's okay.

58:13.573 --> 58:16.242
Woo-jae loves kids.
So it's sad we don't have a kid yet.

58:17.702 --> 58:18.620
Really?

58:18.703 --> 58:21.164
No. We don't want any kids yet.

58:23.750 --> 58:25.168
I'll get going now.

58:26.211 --> 58:29.756
You'll have to see the space again to
get an idea on how to interpret it. Right?

58:29.839 --> 58:32.967
Mr. Woo will talk
to the building management.

58:33.051 --> 58:34.594
Go and see it whenever you need.

58:34.677 --> 58:36.262
Okay. Thank you.

58:47.732 --> 58:50.401
I need to sort out my thoughts
from this meeting today.

58:51.236 --> 58:52.487
Let's take a rain check.

58:53.112 --> 58:54.239
I'll be in the studio.

58:54.322 --> 58:55.573
Okay.

59:12.340 --> 59:13.341
Hello.

59:14.008 --> 59:15.301
Did you eat?

59:16.052 --> 59:18.388
No. I didn't yet.

59:22.267 --> 59:23.434
All right.

59:33.069 --> 59:34.112
This calls for soju.

59:35.363 --> 59:38.199
I can't leave the car here
since it's the gallery's.

59:38.283 --> 59:39.576
Can you be my chauffeur?

59:43.329 --> 59:45.373
I don't drive.

59:46.291 --> 59:48.209
That was a very harsh no.

59:51.713 --> 59:56.259
Sorry about that.
Someone doesn't like it when I drive.

59:57.969 --> 59:59.804
Who? And why?

1:00:00.638 --> 1:00:02.932
Even if I were to ask you,
you wouldn't tell me.

1:00:05.768 --> 1:00:08.146
By the way, why were you at the hospital?

1:00:10.857 --> 1:00:12.233
My daily bread.

1:00:16.696 --> 1:00:18.114
INTERNAL MEDICINE

1:00:18.197 --> 1:00:23.161
If you take benzodiazepine with steroids,
it's worse for your health.

1:00:24.495 --> 1:00:25.788
That's not for me.

1:00:27.624 --> 1:00:29.167
I give that to Woo-jae.

1:00:30.501 --> 1:00:32.503
He developed a tolerance for other drugs.

1:00:33.296 --> 1:00:35.673
So he can only sleep well with it.

1:00:39.761 --> 1:00:41.888
You told me that I seemed high-strung.

1:00:43.056 --> 1:00:44.223
You were right.

1:00:45.058 --> 1:00:47.935
I'm nervous that
Woo-jae might run away while I'm asleep.

1:00:52.649 --> 1:00:55.902
I didn't pester you for an answer.
So don't look at me like that.

1:00:56.944 --> 1:00:58.780
Okay.

1:01:08.998 --> 1:01:11.376
The neighborhood is great here.

1:01:11.459 --> 1:01:14.379
When you buy land, you must consider
the future projects there.

1:01:14.462 --> 1:01:16.923
-Right.
-I already bought 500 <i>pyeong</i> of land.

1:01:17.423 --> 1:01:18.549
Want to see my contract?

1:01:18.633 --> 1:01:22.220
Gosh. I'll show it to you.
You can take a look.

1:01:22.303 --> 1:01:24.806
Right here. Gu Jeong-yeon. 500 <i>pyeong</i>.

1:01:24.889 --> 1:01:25.807
-It's true.
-It is.

1:01:25.890 --> 1:01:27.433
If it's not developed in a decade,

1:01:28.017 --> 1:01:29.477
I'll buy it back. Okay?

1:01:30.978 --> 1:01:33.940
Real estate is about reading
the flow of the market and timing.

1:01:34.023 --> 1:01:36.526
If you miss your window,
say bye-bye for good.

1:01:36.609 --> 1:01:38.861
-Excuse me.
-Goodness.

1:01:38.945 --> 1:01:40.947
Ladies, have some food.

1:01:41.030 --> 1:01:43.950
The food here is one of the best
in this neighborhood.

1:01:44.033 --> 1:01:46.035
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

1:01:46.119 --> 1:01:48.121
-Dig in.
-Okay.

1:01:48.204 --> 1:01:49.831
All right. Let's try some food.

1:01:49.914 --> 1:01:51.749
The location is pretty good.

1:01:51.833 --> 1:01:55.378
I'm going to make you ladies super-rich.

1:01:55.461 --> 1:01:57.130
I should ask my husband first.

1:01:57.213 --> 1:02:00.883
-Come on, girl. What do men know?
-I guess they don't?

1:02:00.967 --> 1:02:02.510
Leave it to us women…

1:02:08.182 --> 1:02:09.142
Ms. Gu.

1:02:09.642 --> 1:02:11.394
I need the measurement list for Choi.

1:02:11.477 --> 1:02:12.437
Okay.

1:02:19.318 --> 1:02:20.611
<i>Your home address.</i>

1:02:21.195 --> 1:02:22.113
Excuse me.

1:02:23.990 --> 1:02:25.616
They are making a fuss.

1:02:26.242 --> 1:02:29.454
I felt a bit dizzy,
so I asked them for some medicine.

1:02:29.954 --> 1:02:33.833
They are forcing me to go to a university
hospital and take a brain scan.

1:02:33.916 --> 1:02:37.879
That must mean it's something serious.
And this is not the first time--

1:02:37.962 --> 1:02:39.964
For people my age,

1:02:40.047 --> 1:02:43.092
being in perfect health is even weirder.

1:02:44.260 --> 1:02:45.344
Give me your address.

1:02:46.095 --> 1:02:47.972
I'll drop off some stuff since I'm here.

1:02:48.473 --> 1:02:50.057
They are heavy. Why did you…

1:02:50.767 --> 1:02:52.310
Just use the courier service.

1:02:52.393 --> 1:02:55.062
I don't know
when they will deliver this to your house.

1:02:55.146 --> 1:02:56.939
I want you to eat it right away.

1:02:57.899 --> 1:03:00.651
Just wait for me at the bus terminal.

1:03:00.735 --> 1:03:02.820
You have a daughter and a granddaughter.

1:03:02.904 --> 1:03:05.615
Anyway, just wait. I'll be there.

1:03:09.035 --> 1:03:10.036
Ms. Gu.

1:03:17.293 --> 1:03:18.377
Hello.

1:03:22.465 --> 1:03:23.883
Thank you.

1:03:48.574 --> 1:03:51.160
The image on this page looks too cold.

1:03:51.244 --> 1:03:53.663
So, increase the intensity
of magenta by 30 percent.

1:03:53.746 --> 1:03:54.956
Another color revision?

1:03:55.039 --> 1:03:58.543
Yes. The artist specifically
asked to get this done.

1:03:59.126 --> 1:04:01.754
And can you increase
the font by five points?

1:04:01.838 --> 1:04:03.673
We must finish everything in two days.

1:04:03.756 --> 1:04:07.760
We cannot make all these revisions
and meet our delivery date.

1:04:07.844 --> 1:04:10.221
Please help us this once.
This is very important.

1:04:10.304 --> 1:04:14.058
Listen. If it is,
why don't you give us more time then?

1:04:14.559 --> 1:04:18.813

<i>Woo-jae will go instead of me.</i>

1:04:25.319 --> 1:04:27.029
<i>Woo-jae will be there.</i>

1:04:27.113 --> 1:04:28.364
<i>Wait there, Grandpa.</i>

1:04:30.908 --> 1:04:32.451
Hello. Woo-jae.

1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:35.329
Where are you now?

1:04:36.289 --> 1:04:38.499
I'm at the building to sketch it.

1:04:38.583 --> 1:04:41.586
I'm stuck at work right now.
But my grandpa…

1:04:41.669 --> 1:04:43.129
Hello?

1:04:43.212 --> 1:04:45.673
My grandpa is waiting at the bus terminal.

1:04:45.756 --> 1:04:47.592
Can you go and pick him up for me?

1:04:47.675 --> 1:04:49.635
Hae-won, I can't hear you well.

1:04:49.719 --> 1:04:51.262
Can you text me?

1:06:00.581 --> 1:06:04.418
Maybe I should've told you
that I was going to be here today.

1:06:07.630 --> 1:06:11.968
I'm done looking around.
You can take your time here.

1:06:13.344 --> 1:06:15.221
You lied to me, didn't you?

1:06:41.956 --> 1:06:43.708
<i>The call could not be made.
After the tone…</i>

1:06:43.791 --> 1:06:45.751

Mom!

1:07:11.068 --> 1:07:16.073
MY PUPPY

1:07:41.932 --> 1:07:45.686
You told me that I used to hate you.

1:07:47.688 --> 1:07:49.023
It was a lie, right?

1:07:53.027 --> 1:07:55.279
I didn't hate you.

1:07:57.114 --> 1:07:58.449
I liked you.

1:08:42.993 --> 1:08:46.163
Did you also have feelings for me?

1:08:46.247 --> 1:08:47.540
<i>Do you want to turn back time?</i>

1:08:47.623 --> 1:08:49.458
<i>I'll wait for you.</i>

1:08:49.959 --> 1:08:51.418
<i>Where were you then?</i>

1:08:51.502 --> 1:08:53.879
Where in the world were you?

1:08:53.963 --> 1:08:55.047
It's driving me nuts!

1:08:55.131 --> 1:08:57.049
<i>I keep seeing someone else in her.</i>

1:08:57.133 --> 1:08:58.592
You crazy bastard.

1:08:58.676 --> 1:09:00.970
<i>No matter how much
you pine for each other,</i>

1:09:01.053 --> 1:09:03.139
<i>it's nothing but a filthy affair

<i>Are you also here for my birthday party?</i>

1:09:07.059 --> 1:09:10.396
<i>I don't think I was invited yet.
Will you invite me?</i>

1:09:10.479 --> 1:09:12.731
Hae-won! Where are you?

1:09:13.399 --> 1:09:14.608
<i>Wherever you are,</i>

1:09:18.070 --> 1:09:21.699
<i>I will follow you tirelessly.</i>
