14:54.040 --> 14:58.360
That's right. Woong is head over heels
for Yu-mi at the moment.

14:58.800 --> 15:01.360
Right, I know that. But...

15:01.440 --> 15:02.920
-But what?
-But what?

15:03.280 --> 15:06.080
Remember what happened three years ago?
That guy betrayed our trust.

15:06.160 --> 15:07.640
-Gosh!
-Right.

15:17.240 --> 15:18.240
Hey...

15:21.600 --> 15:22.840
[You all remember, right?]

15:22.920 --> 15:26.080
[We were so shocked
because we had let our guard down.]

15:41.600 --> 15:45.120
[Don't tell me Woong might do that too.]

15:50.440 --> 15:53.720
No way!
Woong would never do something like that.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.040
No way.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.760
I don't think he would,

15:56.840 --> 15:59.600
but why don't we find out
how he really feels?

15:59.680 --> 16:01.840
How Woong feels about Sae-yi.

16:01.920 --> 16:02.880
-How?
-How?

16:02.960 --> 16:04.680
I've got an idea.

16:17.120 --> 16:19.080
Hello? Are you done?

16:19.280 --> 16:20.440
[Yes, I just finished.]

16:21.040 --> 16:22.480
[Shall we meet at the theater?]

16:23.600 --> 16:25.400
Okay, I'll leave now.

16:25.480 --> 16:27.440
[-Okay, sounds good.]
-See you.

16:29.720 --> 16:32.920
[Since he's taking her out
on a date tonight...]

[Ticket Box]

16:40.160 --> 16:41.680
-Did I keep you waiting long?
-No.

16:41.760 --> 16:44.200
[The wormhole of love
will probably open up today.]

16:50.480 --> 16:51.600
What is this?

16:52.800 --> 16:55.520
A radio that can receive signals
within 1m.

16:55.920 --> 16:57.080
A radio?

16:58.320 --> 17:00.240
Let's have this face Woong.

17:00.440 --> 17:01.560
Now, say something.

17:03.080 --> 17:05.319
Testing, one, two. Hello? Can you hear me?

17:05.880 --> 17:07.319
Perfect. It works very well.

17:07.400 --> 17:10.400
I'll go over to Woong's village
when the wormhole opens up tonight.

17:10.480 --> 17:11.440
-What?
-What?

17:11.520 --> 17:14.040
We should get into his mind
and see what's going on

17:14.119 --> 17:15.680
to find out how he really feels.

17:15.839 --> 17:18.160
I'll go over there and find out
who comes first in Woong's life.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.720
[We're en route]

17:26.800 --> 17:28.720
[to the site at the moment.]

17:29.200 --> 17:33.640
[My gosh. It looks like fog.]

17:37.720 --> 17:39.720
Hey, here.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.280
Come here.

18:03.640 --> 18:04.760
It's the wormhole.

18:08.680 --> 18:10.040
I'll see you later, guys.

18:10.120 --> 18:11.760
Hold onto the radio, okay?

18:11.840 --> 18:13.760
Got it, Love. Be careful!

18:13.840 --> 18:16.440
Don't do anything risky.
Just come back if it gets dangerous!

18:16.600 --> 18:17.600
Okay!

18:35.440 --> 18:37.880
I'm exhausted.
Why am I the only one doing this?

18:41.960 --> 18:44.760
What is the currency of Australia?
Australian dollars!

18:45.520 --> 18:46.560
Jeez.

18:47.480 --> 18:50.040
Quiet science in one word. Silence!

18:50.320 --> 18:51.960
Is this funny? Do I have to laugh?

18:52.040 --> 18:53.400
-It's hilarious!
-It's so lame.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.480
Get him away from me.
What is wrong with him?

18:56.960 --> 18:58.520
This is Woong's village.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.560
[Love! Answer me, over.]

19:01.120 --> 19:03.120
Hey, Reason. I got here safely.

19:03.480 --> 19:04.800
Thank goodness.

19:04.880 --> 19:08.600
To uncover the secret,
we must find a deep corner of his heart.

19:08.680 --> 19:11.600
[-Found it.]
-What? Already?

19:11.800 --> 19:13.480

19:25.880 --> 19:28.720
[Good. Then sneak in there
and make sure no one sees you.]

19:53.320 --> 19:54.960
[Go all the way down,]

20:20.480 --> 20:22.440
No, not yet.

20:22.560 --> 20:23.720
[That can't be.]

20:24.320 --> 20:25.440
I don't see it anywhere.

20:25.520 --> 20:28.640
Maybe Woong has no secrets.

20:30.960 --> 20:33.520
[He rarely shows his emotions,
so there's no way]

20:33.600 --> 20:35.200
[he doesn't have any secrets.]

That's good. If she's at 11,
we don't have to worry. Over.

28:27.760 --> 28:29.480
Where did the necklace go?

28:29.560 --> 28:32.320
I left it at home in case she loses it.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.320
Who told you to do that?

28:39.240 --> 28:42.280

No. I don't like vegetables.

Yu-mi's ex, Ugi is coming to the wedding,

43:18.600 --> 43:19.720
It's bad news.

43:36.680 --> 43:39.920
-I like vegetables.
-How much did you eat?

43:41.040 --> 43:42.240
I didn't count it.

43:42.880 --> 43:43.880
I'm full.

43:43.960 --> 43:45.080
My gosh.

43:46.160 --> 43:48.320
Ms. Kim. Is that enough for lunch?

43:52.480 --> 43:54.520
I guess I'm a herbivore.

44:29.240 --> 44:30.960

-I'm tired. Why would you do that?

[-Perfect.]

46:23.760 --> 46:26.920
Yes, Woong. When are you coming?
I'm ready.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.960

46:36.480 --> 46:38.160
You said it will be done by yesterday.

46:38.240 --> 46:39.960
I couldn't finish it
because there was a problem.

Hey. Have one. It will wake you up.

Do you have to go to that wedding?
You don't even know her.

47:08.960 --> 47:11.680
It's Yu-mi's wish. I should grant it.

47:11.760 --> 47:14.840
I told you when you said
you were going on a blind date.

47:14.920 --> 47:18.880
Women that age expect marriage
when they're on a blind date.

47:19.360 --> 47:22.400
Yu-mi is probably thinking
about marriage seriously.

47:23.040 --> 47:24.120
I bet she isn't.

47:25.320 --> 47:26.360
What a fool.

47:26.800 --> 47:29.480
That's what she meant when she asked you
to go to the wedding with her.

47:29.560 --> 47:32.240
That's what it means
to introduce you to her friends.

47:32.880 --> 47:34.400
That makes sense.

47:34.480 --> 47:38.360
When women reach this age,
we don't care about how long we dated.

It wouldn't matter if you're thinking
about marriage soon.

When he stays up all night at work,
he doesn't get to wash his hair.

52:12.960 --> 52:14.960
I doubt it. What do you think of Woong?

52:15.040 --> 52:17.400

52:58.240 --> 53:00.760
So he might look a little messy.

He's really busy lately.

53:04.280 --> 53:06.080
Right. My boyfriend looks messy too

Really? Right?

53:07.600 --> 53:08.640
Yes.

My husband can't even shave
when he's in a rush in the morning.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.440
That's not right.

53:13.520 --> 53:15.880
He needs to shave at least.

53:15.960 --> 53:17.360
What are you saying about my husband?

53:17.440 --> 53:20.400
It looks like leads. It doesn't look nice.

He shines. He looks handsome.

54:01.480 --> 54:02.680
That's it.

54:02.760 --> 54:06.480
I told Woong to wear like that,
but why is that punk wearing that?

54:07.600 --> 54:09.800
People are going to compare
her ex and her current boyfriend.

54:09.880 --> 54:10.800
What do we do?

54:11.520 --> 54:15.640
Guys. I'm afraid it's going to
be embarrassing. What do we do?

54:16.720 --> 54:18.640
Should I tell him not to come?

54:18.720 --> 54:21.560
Honestly, I don't want him to come.

54:22.640 --> 54:26.240
We begged him to come
when he was so busy. We can't do that.

54:26.320 --> 54:29.840
He's late anyways.
Tell him to take his time.

54:31.800 --> 54:35.520
[Woong. If traffic is heavy,
don't rush. Take your time.]

54:35.520 --> 54:37.440
[Actually, I'm stuck in traffic.]

54:36.160 --> 54:37.480
[Actually, I'm stuck in traffic.]

54:39.680 --> 54:41.840
[Then don't push yourself...]

54:40.960 --> 54:42.000
[Then don't push yourself...]

54:41.920 --> 54:44.120
[So I got out of the cab and running.]

54:42.080 --> 54:43.600
[So I got out of the cab and running.]

54:45.560 --> 54:46.560
Running?

54:49.840 --> 54:51.200
If he runs, he'll sweat.

54:55.080 --> 54:57.400
His hair must be oily already.

54:57.760 --> 55:00.120
On top of that, he'll be soaked in sweat?

55:07.880 --> 55:11.080
Now that I gave up on everything,
I found peace.

55:11.280 --> 55:13.360
That's good. Repeat after me.

55:13.440 --> 55:15.280
It is what it is.

55:15.440 --> 55:17.200
It is what it is.

55:21.280 --> 55:23.120
[It is what it is.]

55:23.680 --> 55:25.480
[It is what it is.]

55:26.120 --> 55:27.200
Guys.

55:29.000 --> 55:30.760
Let me just tell you in advance.

55:31.120 --> 55:34.080
A hobo is going to walk in soon.

55:35.120 --> 55:36.160
A hobo?

55:36.240 --> 55:38.880
Yes. But don't be surprised.

55:39.240 --> 55:41.680
That hobo is my boyfriend.

55:43.640 --> 55:45.120
My goodness.

55:48.480 --> 55:49.480
[Text Messages]

55:49.560 --> 55:50.720
[Yu-mi. It's me, Ugi.]

55:49.800 --> 55:51.880
[Yu-mi. It's me, Ugi.]

56:04.080 --> 56:05.240
[Are you busy?]

56:05.320 --> 56:08.160
[If you have time, do you want to talk
for a second before the wedding starts?]

56:07.360 --> 56:09.200
[Are you busy?]

56:08.480 --> 56:10.320
[I'll wait at the back of the cathedral.]

56:24.360 --> 56:26.960
You're here. I didn't think you'd come.

56:29.080 --> 56:31.720
[Guys, are you ready?]

56:33.840 --> 56:37.440
You heard how our trustworthy Woong
is showing up looking like a hobo, right?

56:37.520 --> 56:38.560
-We did.
-We did.

56:38.760 --> 56:40.600
There's nobody here to help us.

56:40.680 --> 56:42.480
We don't need anyone either.

56:42.560 --> 56:44.240
-Right.
-Right.

56:44.320 --> 56:47.640
So let's get rid of them
on our own, right here.

56:47.720 --> 56:49.320
That little jerk!

56:49.400 --> 56:51.880
Get rid of that jerk!

56:51.960 --> 56:53.320
Is everyone holding a bomb?

56:53.400 --> 56:54.440
-Yes.
-Yes.

56:57.400 --> 56:59.080
Ji Ugi is a strong opponent.

56:59.360 --> 57:01.680
The longer the conversation,
the bigger the disadvantage is for us.

57:01.760 --> 57:03.280
So there is only one plan.

57:03.760 --> 57:06.840
The moment he tries to do something,
we will end the situation,

57:06.920 --> 57:08.800
by cursing him out relentlessly.
Understand?

57:08.880 --> 57:10.160
-Okay!
-Okay!

57:16.120 --> 57:19.240
Everything is the same here.
Nothing has changed.

57:21.240 --> 57:22.400
Why did you call me here?

57:22.720 --> 57:24.040
Don't you remember?

57:24.120 --> 57:25.800
Hyun-soo got married here too.

57:26.960 --> 57:29.800
How many years ago was that again?

57:31.480 --> 57:34.680
We came here for the wedding,
and then you and I...

57:36.640 --> 57:37.720
Don't you remember?

57:39.400 --> 57:42.280
There he goes trying to bring up
old memories.

57:43.960 --> 57:45.400
He's probably going to start soon.

57:48.360 --> 57:49.880
When he says, "I thought about you"

57:49.960 --> 57:52.200
or "Let's start again",

57:52.280 --> 57:54.000
we're going to throw the bombs!

57:54.080 --> 57:55.240
-Okay!
-Okay!

57:56.720 --> 57:59.280
We were so innocent back then.

57:59.600 --> 58:00.680
Why did you call me here?

58:02.560 --> 58:04.320
I asked why you called me here.

58:04.960 --> 58:06.480
If you're going to talk about the past--

58:06.560 --> 58:07.720
I have something to tell you.

58:17.160 --> 58:18.280
Excuse me.

58:20.120 --> 58:21.720
-Yes?
-Are you

58:21.800 --> 58:24.120
Kim Yu-mi's friends?

58:27.040 --> 58:28.120
Something to say?

58:28.200 --> 58:29.280
Well...

58:30.200 --> 58:32.720
Can you hurry? I need to go back in.

58:33.640 --> 58:34.720
Yu-mi.

58:34.800 --> 58:36.200
Get ready...

58:45.880 --> 58:47.640
I'm getting married soon.

58:49.840 --> 58:50.960
-What?
-What?

58:51.040 --> 58:52.640
What?

58:58.840 --> 59:01.280
I'm getting married in the spring.
In March.

59:03.920 --> 59:05.000
With whom?

59:06.720 --> 59:07.880
That woman?

59:13.840 --> 59:15.520
He's marrying that woman?

59:16.120 --> 59:19.240
My gosh! That jerk is a jerk
until the very end!

59:20.680 --> 59:21.880
Oh, that hurts!

59:23.400 --> 59:25.320
Emotion, where are you going?

59:27.920 --> 59:31.680
Really? I see.

59:32.480 --> 59:35.440
-Yes.
-Why are you telling me that?

59:35.520 --> 59:37.760
I'm going to tell our classmates soon,

59:37.840 --> 59:41.960
but I didn't think it was right
to make you hear it from someone else.

59:42.080 --> 59:44.480
-"Right"?
-I heard you were coming to the wedding,

59:44.640 --> 59:46.280
so I thought this was my chance.

59:53.760 --> 59:55.680
Yu-mi. Are you okay?

59:56.800 --> 59:58.080
What?

59:58.480 --> 59:59.960
You look really surprised.

1:00:00.640 --> 1:00:01.800
Are you okay?

1:00:05.320 --> 1:00:08.200
I'm worried you might take it hard.

1:00:11.600 --> 1:00:15.400
What is that crazy idiot saying?

1:00:25.240 --> 1:00:27.560
Yu-mi. The time I spent with you

1:00:28.200 --> 1:00:31.880
will remain in my memories as
one of my brightest days forever.

1:00:31.960 --> 1:00:34.320
You were the blessing of my 20s.

1:00:35.560 --> 1:00:39.160
So I'd like it if you weren't so shocked.

1:00:47.960 --> 1:00:49.320
Shocked?

1:00:50.160 --> 1:00:51.280
Why would I be?

1:00:52.240 --> 1:00:56.080
It just means we're at the age
to get married.

1:00:56.760 --> 1:00:57.760
Right.

1:01:00.600 --> 1:01:04.280
To be honest,
I'm getting married soon too.

1:01:05.400 --> 1:01:06.840
-Really?
-Yes.

1:01:06.920 --> 1:01:09.880
I think our wedding will be
sometime next year.

1:01:09.960 --> 1:01:11.640
But of course,
you'd get married before us.

1:01:12.080 --> 1:01:14.640
Emotion! Where did she go?

1:01:14.760 --> 1:01:16.800
She's getting married next year?

1:01:16.880 --> 1:01:18.920
-What?
-Did I hear that right?

1:01:19.080 --> 1:01:20.240
Really?

1:01:21.160 --> 1:01:22.840
Oh, really?

1:01:23.520 --> 1:01:24.440
With whom?

1:01:24.520 --> 1:01:26.400
Who do you think? A guy, of course.

1:01:27.040 --> 1:01:29.600
It's been a while since
we started dating too.

1:01:30.040 --> 1:01:33.680
Who is it? Who's lying like this?

1:01:33.760 --> 1:01:35.400
It's me. What are you going to do?

1:01:36.600 --> 1:01:38.800
Gosh, she's causing trouble again!

1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:41.960
Didn't you hear?
Na-ri and all my friends already know.

1:01:42.080 --> 1:01:44.080
He has terrible style, but he's nice.

1:01:44.160 --> 1:01:45.560
That's all that matters!

1:01:45.800 --> 1:01:48.120
Emotions! You can't just say
whatever comes to mind!

1:01:48.200 --> 1:01:50.120
Even if you're mad!

1:01:50.360 --> 1:01:53.480
Who cares? That jerk is bragging about
getting married. Should we stay quiet?

1:01:53.560 --> 1:01:54.960
We have to say something to him too!

1:01:55.280 --> 1:01:56.800
He proposed already.

1:01:56.880 --> 1:01:58.680
Emotion! Stop!

1:01:58.760 --> 1:02:01.840
-He said life is meaningless without me.
-Hey! Stop right there!

1:02:01.920 --> 1:02:03.600
-You punk! What are you doing?
-Stop it!

1:02:03.800 --> 1:02:05.920
It hasn't been long since he proposed.

1:02:06.240 --> 1:02:09.680
Oh, right. I forgot to bring my ring.

1:02:10.280 --> 1:02:12.560
We're going to set the date soon.

1:02:12.640 --> 1:02:16.680
Earliest date will probably be
in late spring... No, early summer.

1:02:17.280 --> 1:02:19.920
To be honest, my boyfriend keeps
trying to rush the date.

1:02:20.160 --> 1:02:23.040
I want to get married later,

1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:25.960
but I didn't think it'd be right
to make him wait.

1:02:26.080 --> 1:02:28.040
Where are you getting married?

1:02:28.120 --> 1:02:29.360
Send me your wedding invitation.

1:02:29.440 --> 1:02:32.320
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I can invite you to our wedding.

1:02:32.400 --> 1:02:36.320
We're thinking about going abroad
and having a small wedding.

1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:39.520
My boyfriend likes romantic things.

1:02:39.600 --> 1:02:41.600
We're thinking about Hawaii
for the destination.

1:02:41.680 --> 1:02:44.560
Hey. Will you stop? Stop!

1:02:50.240 --> 1:02:51.520
No!

1:02:54.280 --> 1:02:56.920
It must be starting. We should go in.

1:02:57.120 --> 1:02:58.120
In any case,

1:02:58.760 --> 1:02:59.800
congratulations.

1:03:09.280 --> 1:03:10.560
It's Woong!

1:03:12.720 --> 1:03:15.440
It's Woong. Woong heard everything.

1:03:15.520 --> 1:03:17.560
You ended up causing trouble.
It's all your fault!

1:03:17.640 --> 1:03:19.200
What are you going to do?

1:03:23.160 --> 1:03:24.160
Woong.

1:03:24.760 --> 1:03:27.200
Yu-mi. I've been looking all over for you.

1:03:27.560 --> 1:03:28.840
You said you'd be inside.

1:03:29.440 --> 1:03:30.440
Oh, right...

1:03:30.720 --> 1:03:32.120
Are you...

1:03:34.160 --> 1:03:35.960
Yu-mi's boyfriend?

1:03:37.600 --> 1:03:38.720
Yes.

1:03:38.800 --> 1:03:40.680
Hello. I'm Yu-mi's...

1:03:42.560 --> 1:03:43.680
I'm Yu-mi's friend.

1:03:43.760 --> 1:03:45.720
We were all classmates
with the bride in college.

1:03:45.800 --> 1:03:48.960
I see. Hello. I'm Goo Woong.

1:03:49.960 --> 1:03:52.640
Nice to meet you. I'm Ji Ugi.

1:03:55.840 --> 1:03:57.160
Gosh.

You're very...

1:04:00.720 --> 1:04:01.720
Yes?

1:04:02.160 --> 1:04:05.160
You're very handsome.
You don't look like a hobo.

1:04:08.360 --> 1:04:09.360
Sorry?

1:04:09.440 --> 1:04:11.760
Also, congratulations.

1:04:13.240 --> 1:04:14.320
For what?

1:04:14.480 --> 1:04:16.280
I heard you're getting married soon.

1:04:21.920 --> 1:04:24.840
What should we do?

1:04:25.400 --> 1:04:29.160
What should we do?

1:04:34.360 --> 1:04:36.880
I just heard you guys are getting married
next year.

1:04:39.640 --> 1:04:41.320
Yes. Thank you.

your boyfriend is!]

He looks better in person than in photos.
