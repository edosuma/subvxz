You're looking at the only
human known to have survived

00:06.729 --> 00:07.963
being bitten by a zombie.

00:07.997 --> 00:09.832
If we can get him to the lab in California

00:09.866 --> 00:12.468
they can use his blood and
make more of the vaccine.

00:13.870 --> 00:14.903

00:14.938 --> 00:16.171
You still think about him?

00:17.006 --> 00:18.273

Antoine?

00:39.729 --> 00:41.163
(Citizen Z) I've decided to catalog

00:41.197 --> 00:43.799
all the theories about
where the Z virus came from.

00:44.234 --> 00:45.567
There's more than a few.

00:45.602 --> 00:48.470
Is it what the Zoroastrians
would call Frashokereti?

00:48.505 --> 00:51.573
Or are we contaminated
with Amazon brain rot?

00:51.808 --> 00:54.076
Or maybe we passed through
the tail of a comet

00:54.110 --> 00:56.078
that sprinkled the earth with zombie dust.

00:56.946 --> 00:59.314
Or was it a defense
department weaponized virus

00:59.349 --> 01:00.382
that escaped the lab?

01:01.217 --> 01:02.184
Or how about

01:09.626 --> 01:12.694
As things went south the
theories got weirder.

01:12.896 --> 01:15.397
Good times for religions with
an end of the world scenario.

01:15.431 --> 01:16.965
The crazier the better.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.434
The Apocalypse business was booming.

01:19.469 --> 01:21.470
At least while there still
was business to boom.

01:22.172 --> 01:24.373
It reminds me of a poem by Yeats.

01:24.707 --> 01:28.529
"And what rough beast,
its hour come round at last,

01:28.563 --> 01:30.598

see them again in this life,

Speaking of hair,
what's with all the bald patches?

04:05.920 --> 04:07.688
Maybe that vaccine is like zombie chemo.

04:07.722 --> 04:09.857
Or maybe that vaccine isn't working.

04:24.572 --> 04:25.773
What do you think, Doc?

04:26.408 --> 04:28.409
I've seen Zs look better than him.

04:30.044 --> 04:31.845
Will he make it to California?

04:31.880 --> 04:33.247
If we haul ass.

04:33.281 --> 04:36.083
If he goes zombie,
we might have to put him down.

Well don't get your hopes up.

05:30.738 --> 05:32.573
We don't even know if
this place still exists.

05:32.607 --> 05:35.676
Hammond had it marked on
his map as a resupply place.

05:35.710 --> 05:38.011
And if his contact there
is the same Major Williams

05:38.046 --> 05:40.881
from my National Guard days,
we might actually get some help.

05:44.486 --> 05:48.188
that dead guy was a hero
who <i> died</i> protecting you.

Just because he's dead
doesn't make him a hero.

05:51.493 --> 05:53.360
Well I hope Province Town does exist

05:53.394 --> 05:56.497

At least not alive.

Didn't expect to see you again either.

out of a ditch full of Zs.

08:26.514 --> 08:29.082
How many Zs we kill that day?

08:29.917 --> 08:31.451
Not enough.

08:32.953 --> 08:34.054
Do you mind?

Haven't seen anyone east of the
Mississippi for over a year.

09:00.581 --> 09:01.615
How many of you are there?

09:01.649 --> 09:04.418
Eight. Including a doctor.

09:04.452 --> 09:05.886
Real doctor?

09:05.920 --> 09:06.920
Sort of.

You're welcome to wait
outside in your vehicle.

12:31.040 --> 12:34.443
You'll have to forgive my friend.
He's been through a lot.

12:34.477 --> 12:38.480
We all have. Nothing's perfect,
but this is as close as it gets.

12:38.515 --> 12:39.948
After a while, most people find

12:39.983 --> 12:42.050
they can actually sleep through the night.

12:42.085 --> 12:44.353
Really? I can't imagine that.

12:45.121 --> 12:47.222
We grow all our own fruits and vegetables.

12:47.257 --> 12:50.492
The scraps and our waste all
go into a biomass generator.

12:50.527 --> 12:53.428
We're up to four hours of electricity a day.

12:53.463 --> 12:55.831
Really? That's cool.

12:58.067 --> 12:59.501
What's their story?

12:59.536 --> 13:02.604
We had a little trouble a while
back with a preacher we took in.

13:02.639 --> 13:04.139
He drank his own kool-aid.

13:04.174 --> 13:06.975
Decided the Zompocalypse was
actually The Second Coming

13:07.010 --> 13:09.578
and we needed to save the Zs, not kill them.

13:09.612 --> 13:12.915
Calls them "The Resurrected."
Real whack-job.

13:12.949 --> 13:14.616
I'm not an expert on the Bible,

13:14.651 --> 13:17.553
but I'm pretty sure there's
nothing in there about zombies.

13:17.587 --> 13:19.721
We had to kick him out,
along with his followers.

13:19.756 --> 13:22.891
I've seen this kind of thing before.
Crazy spreads fast.

13:22.926 --> 13:24.993
So why would you <i> let</i> them back in?

13:25.028 --> 13:26.895
They all had family still here.

13:26.930 --> 13:28.430
I knew once they were out a while,

13:28.464 --> 13:30.899
they'd get hungry or scared
and some would come back.

13:30.934 --> 13:33.202
Like clockwork these three turned up today.

13:33.870 --> 13:35.370
Not true believers, huh?

13:35.405 --> 13:38.040
Hard to <i> believe</i> on an empty stomach.

13:38.074 --> 13:40.509
Speaking of which,
let's get you people something to eat.

13:40.543 --> 13:42.945
First meal is on me. The rest you trade for.

13:42.979 --> 13:45.247
No meat of course. Hope you're vegetarian.

13:45.615 --> 13:46.415
Oh yeah.

13:48.985 --> 13:51.453
We're headed to a CDC lab in California.

13:52.055 --> 13:53.889
You're never gonna make it to California.

13:53.923 --> 13:55.324
Yeah, that's what I've been told.

13:55.358 --> 13:56.892
No, seriously.

13:56.926 --> 13:59.494
The Zs are swarming out
west. Millions of them.

13:59.529 --> 14:01.363
Been hearing about it second and third hand.

14:01.397 --> 14:02.898
Nothing left to eat in the city,

14:02.932 --> 14:05.567
so they're pouring into open country,
forming mega herds.

14:05.602 --> 14:08.503
Rumor has it the whole
west coast is a no-go zone.

14:08.538 --> 14:09.771
Well we still got to try.

14:09.806 --> 14:12.741
The guy's a pain in the ass,
but he's our only chance for a cure.

14:12.775 --> 14:14.910
Getting yourself killed won't cure anything.

14:14.944 --> 14:16.144
I could use you here.

14:16.179 --> 14:18.714
I need experienced soldiers and a doctor.

14:18.748 --> 14:22.217
That's a tempting offer, Joe.
But we got to keep going.

14:22.252 --> 14:25.020
Clock's ticking on our guy.
In fact, I could use your help.

14:25.054 --> 14:28.023
We could use an old school ass
kicker like you out on the road.

14:28.057 --> 14:32.327
I don't know.
I've seen so much hope come to nothing.

14:32.362 --> 14:34.296
This is the first thing I've been a part of

14:34.330 --> 14:35.597
that might actually work.

14:35.632 --> 14:37.633
These folks rely on me.

14:38.534 --> 14:40.002
I know.

14:40.303 --> 14:42.037
I get it.

14:43.373 --> 14:45.807
I've got a spare room two
or three of you can use.

14:45.842 --> 14:48.410
The rest can grab a bunk
in the community room.

14:53.049 --> 14:54.917
Let me think about what you said.

14:54.951 --> 14:58.353
We'll talk more tomorrow.
In the meantime, get some rest.

14:58.388 --> 14:59.121
Thanks.

14:59.489 --> 15:00.422
Thank you.

15:21.811 --> 15:25.213
Dude. Dude, slow down.
They're not gonna take it from you.

15:25.915 --> 15:27.783
So...

15:27.817 --> 15:29.952
We got the lowdown on
the sleeping situation.

15:29.986 --> 15:32.020
There's a room that two
or three of us can share,

15:32.055 --> 15:33.355
and there's a communal bunk.

15:33.389 --> 15:34.790
Dibs on the room.

15:35.992 --> 15:39.361
What?
Be less risk of anyone figuring out who I am.

15:41.898 --> 15:44.466
I think we should give it to those two.

15:47.470 --> 15:50.005
What, no, no, no. We're not a...

15:50.039 --> 15:51.373
[Addy laughs]

15:51.407 --> 15:52.841
Yeah, you guys take it.

15:52.875 --> 15:53.608
Yeah.

15:53.643 --> 15:55.410
Is it that obvious?

15:56.846 --> 15:58.981
Well...

15:59.015 --> 16:00.816
If we're gonna do the time,

16:00.850 --> 16:03.919
we may as well do the crime.

16:07.256 --> 16:10.993
[Doc laughs]

16:12.128 --> 16:14.529
- [whispering] Are you serious?
- [whispering] Yes. Well that was funny.

16:14.564 --> 16:15.230
[Addy laughs]

16:50.949 --> 16:54.385
It's not exactly what I was...

16:55.087 --> 16:56.521
It's perfect.

17:00.359 --> 17:02.393
[clearing throat] Roberta, ummm...

17:02.428 --> 17:03.895
Yeah?

17:06.531 --> 17:07.698
[laughs] I mean, come on.

17:07.733 --> 17:11.002
This room,
it's like you know here's the bed.

17:11.036 --> 17:12.569
[laughing]

17:12.604 --> 17:14.305
It's...

17:16.275 --> 17:17.208
cozy.

17:17.675 --> 17:19.210
Cozy.

17:21.847 --> 17:23.080
[Whispers] Yeah.

17:23.682 --> 17:25.383
[whispering] I don't know what to say.

17:26.484 --> 17:27.819
[whispering] Don't say anything.

17:49.108 --> 17:51.342
Hey, ummm, I don't have any...

17:51.910 --> 17:53.411
We'll think of something.

17:57.182 --> 17:58.649
I went to Catholic school.

17:59.384 --> 18:00.118
Oh.

18:02.321 --> 18:03.154
[whispering] Chair.

18:03.188 --> 18:04.555
[whispering] All right.

18:09.828 --> 18:12.063
What are you worried about the nuns?

18:12.664 --> 18:14.332
Never know.

18:40.526 --> 18:44.328
For indeed we have had
good news preached to us,

18:44.363 --> 18:45.730
just as the unbelievers.

18:46.832 --> 18:49.133
But the word they heard did not profit them,

18:49.168 --> 18:51.469
for their hearts were closed to the truth.

18:52.304 --> 18:53.971
So then we

18:54.006 --> 18:56.507
shall open their eyes.

19:01.880 --> 19:03.414
That fella seems pretty popular

19:03.448 --> 19:06.050
for a guy who just got kicked out of here.

19:06.084 --> 19:08.519
It was a lot harder than we expected it.

19:08.554 --> 19:10.254
Thought we'd be better off back here.

19:10.989 --> 19:13.524
Lucky for you the Major was
willing to take you in again.

19:14.793 --> 19:17.495
Yes, it was lucky for us all.

19:27.372 --> 19:29.574
Hey, Luke. Glad to see you back, man.

19:29.608 --> 19:32.043
I knew you were too smart to
fall for that Jacob clown.

19:32.077 --> 19:33.044
Yeah.

19:33.078 --> 19:34.512
It wasn't at all what I
thought it was gonna be.

19:34.546 --> 19:35.413
Glad to be back.

19:36.315 --> 19:39.050
I think I left some meds in my ammo bag.

19:39.084 --> 19:40.484
Do you mind checking for me?

19:40.519 --> 19:41.752
Sure, hang on.

19:50.729 --> 19:51.762
<i> [cracking sound]</i>

20:09.815 --> 20:11.616
Hey, are you all right?

20:22.027 --> 20:23.894
Listen to me, all of you,

20:23.996 --> 20:25.263
for I have good news.

20:26.498 --> 20:29.300
The major didn't believe
in the word of Jacob.

20:29.334 --> 20:30.534
But he will.

20:30.569 --> 20:33.671
All of you will be given
another chance to hear his word

20:33.705 --> 20:35.973
and join the Resurrection Church.

20:36.808 --> 20:38.609
What are you doing? Get down from there.

20:40.646 --> 20:41.612
He's got a weapon!

20:42.648 --> 20:44.282
[struggling]

20:44.316 --> 20:47.151
For as the Father raises the
dead and gives them life,

20:47.185 --> 20:50.288
so also the Son gives life to whom he will.

20:54.259 --> 20:56.727
[gagging]

20:57.796 --> 20:58.596
He's gonna turn.

20:58.630 --> 20:59.930
[gagging]

21:00.198 --> 21:01.365
Damn it.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.668

21:33.332 --> 21:34.832
Oh God! Luke!

21:34.866 --> 21:38.002
Help me secure these doors!
We have to contain this!

21:55.154 --> 21:57.022

21:57.056 --> 22:00.425
Are you sure you didn't
go to Catholic school?

22:00.927 --> 22:01.593
[knocking]

22:01.627 --> 22:04.429
Uh-uh. Go away!

22:06.599 --> 22:09.501
Hey! This is a very bad time to bother us.

22:09.535 --> 22:11.336
Oh, terrible time.

22:24.150 --> 22:25.450
[whispering] Zombies?

22:26.619 --> 22:28.453

[growling] [screaming]

24:07.582 --> 24:10.017
I would give my left nut for
that z-whacker right now!

[punch]

24:13.288 --> 24:14.121
Come on, you guys!

24:14.156 --> 24:15.823
Let's go!

25:03.171 --> 25:04.305
[breathing heavily] Where's Murphy?

25:04.339 --> 25:06.373
The last we saw, he ran out some other door.

25:06.408 --> 25:08.843
We need a leash for that guy.

25:35.371 --> 25:38.039
Someone wedged that door
open for the zombies.

25:39.875 --> 25:40.608
What?

25:41.010 --> 25:42.977
[growling]

25:43.012 --> 25:50.051
[growling] [sounds of impact]

25:50.653 --> 25:52.820

25:52.855 --> 25:54.922
We can barely face these guys one at a time.

25:54.957 --> 25:57.825
This outbreak spreads,
they'll be coming at us 50 at a time.

25:57.860 --> 25:59.127
What about Murphy and the others?

25:59.161 --> 26:00.662
I don't know. We need weapons.

26:00.696 --> 26:01.195
[clang]

26:03.666 --> 26:04.565
Joe.

26:05.634 --> 26:06.901
What the hell happened?

26:07.169 --> 26:08.836
Jacob and his cult.

26:08.871 --> 26:11.606
The ones we let back in slit their throats.

26:11.640 --> 26:13.908
Goddamn suicide zombies.

26:14.376 --> 26:15.643
They sabotaged the doors.

26:15.678 --> 26:17.478
[whispering] Insane bastards.

26:17.513 --> 26:21.049
Everything we've worked for, it's gone.
All gone.

26:22.618 --> 26:24.018
We need weapons.

26:24.053 --> 26:26.087
The armory's full of Zs.
We can't get in there.

26:26.121 --> 26:27.355
Well you got to have some hidden somewhere.

26:27.389 --> 26:28.956
No. They're all in the cage.

26:28.991 --> 26:29.891
All of them?!

26:29.925 --> 26:31.659
How are we supposed to defend ourselves?!

26:31.694 --> 26:33.161
I thought we were zombie-proofed!

26:33.195 --> 26:33.995
Hey, Joe.

26:34.029 --> 26:35.363
You got to pull yourself together, man.

26:35.397 --> 26:37.265
There's got to be a way out of here.

26:37.299 --> 26:38.566
(Mack) Garnett!

26:38.600 --> 26:39.867
[breathing heavily]

26:39.902 --> 26:41.102
Thank God you're okay.

26:41.136 --> 26:42.203
Where's Murphy?

26:42.237 --> 26:44.238
Got separated. Zombies everywhere.

26:44.273 --> 26:45.139
10K?

26:45.174 --> 26:46.741
He's out there somewhere.

26:46.775 --> 26:48.743
If anyone can make it he can.

26:49.311 --> 26:50.812
If only he had his gun.

26:52.414 --> 26:54.148
You have to get to the emergency exit

26:54.183 --> 26:55.350
before we're completely overrun.

26:55.384 --> 26:56.017
Where is it?

26:56.051 --> 26:57.051
Through those doors.

26:57.086 --> 26:58.886
There's a long hallway
ending in a reinforced door.

26:58.921 --> 27:00.355
It leads outside the perimeter.

27:00.389 --> 27:01.789
Don't stop till you hit the woods,

27:01.824 --> 27:03.424
then you can double back
around to your truck.

27:03.459 --> 27:04.459
What about you?

27:04.493 --> 27:07.128
I've got to stay and try
to save as many as I can.

27:07.730 --> 27:08.363
Ready?

27:08.397 --> 27:08.963
[whispering] Yeah. Yeah.

27:08.997 --> 27:09.497
Indeed.

27:09.531 --> 27:11.499
All right, let's go!

Sorry. You look like one of them.

27:38.427 --> 27:40.762
You don't look so good yourself, sweetheart.

27:40.796 --> 27:41.996
Look, I need some help.

27:42.030 --> 27:43.131
Okay.

27:43.165 --> 27:45.733

Two of us might have a chance.

Are you part of this?!

Our Second Coming is here!

28:39.054 --> 28:41.789
Behold the Resurrected!

28:41.824 --> 28:44.926
It's time to take what is rightfully ours.

28:44.960 --> 28:47.161
Bring me the Blasphemers alive.

28:47.196 --> 28:56.671

Turn around! Turn around!

29:00.843 --> 29:02.543
Back up! The door's blocked!

Murphy?

30:28.743 --> 30:29.443
Haven't seen him.

30:29.477 --> 30:30.210
We need weapons.

30:30.245 --> 30:31.712
Then we'll find Murphy. Let's go.

30:31.746 --> 30:33.147
[muffled growling]

30:33.648 --> 30:35.816
Greetings brothers and sisters.

30:35.850 --> 30:37.651
The Resurrection Church welcomes you.

30:37.686 --> 30:39.520
Please raise your hands to the heavens

30:39.554 --> 30:41.789
or I will resurrect you where you stand.

30:44.926 --> 30:45.793
[machine gun firing]

30:46.261 --> 30:47.227
Let them go.

30:47.596 --> 30:49.597
The Resurrected will take care of them.

30:49.965 --> 30:51.966
The rest of you, come with us.

30:58.139 --> 31:06.180
[snarling and growling]

31:06.214 --> 31:09.350
The last of the Resurrected
have been secured.

31:09.584 --> 31:11.285
And those who died today have the honor

31:11.319 --> 31:13.120
of entering into grace ahead of us.

31:13.788 --> 31:15.789
Blessed is the path before them.

31:15.824 --> 31:18.325
Blessed will their journey be.

31:18.360 --> 31:20.527
Brothers and sisters,

31:20.562 --> 31:23.864
I know you have hate in
your hearts right now

31:23.898 --> 31:27.534
and do not come willingly
to this test of faith.

31:27.569 --> 31:31.302
But today each of you will become part

31:31.402 --> 31:35.838
of the New Resurrection Church.

31:35.948 --> 31:37.948
You must choose how you are served.

31:37.973 --> 31:40.207
You may join the living flock

31:40.242 --> 31:43.811
and spend your days serving the Resurrected.

31:43.845 --> 31:47.381
Or your souls taking the
next step on their journey

31:47.416 --> 31:49.383
to eternal life.

31:49.418 --> 31:51.318
The time has come for you to choose.

31:51.353 --> 31:52.620
[growling]

31:52.654 --> 31:55.623
Join me and walk among the living

31:55.657 --> 31:57.391
or follow this blasphemer

31:57.426 --> 31:59.693
who thought he could oppose the righteous

31:59.728 --> 32:01.462
and now walks among the dead.

32:01.496 --> 32:03.798

32:18.280 --> 32:21.682
Now don't feel sorrow for the Major,
brothers and sisters.

32:21.716 --> 32:25.085
Although we stood against the man he was,

32:25.120 --> 32:29.356
we take joy in his choice
to join the Resurrected!

32:29.391 --> 32:31.525
Blessed is the path before him!

32:31.560 --> 32:33.127
What choice?

32:33.161 --> 32:35.763
To live with you lunatics
or die and become a zombie?

32:35.797 --> 32:37.264
<i>[snarling and growling continue]</i>

32:37.299 --> 32:39.395
I don't know your name, brother.

32:39.419 --> 32:41.419
But I welcome you to the resurrection church.

32:42.199 --> 32:44.800
With us you will know
everlasting joy and peace.

32:44.835 --> 32:46.936
There was peace here.

32:46.970 --> 32:50.840
Joe Williams, the man you killed,
gave you peace.

32:50.874 --> 32:54.110
This was a good place.
This was a safe place.

32:54.144 --> 32:56.612
[Garnett continues] And it can be again.

32:56.647 --> 32:59.048
It's not too late. Put down your weapons.

32:59.082 --> 33:00.950
Let's live the way that
people are supposed to.

33:00.984 --> 33:03.519
Helping one another, working together.
It's not too late.

33:03.554 --> 33:06.989
Put down your weapons.
Let us free. We'll help you.

33:07.024 --> 33:08.724
The Resurrected aren't any closer to God

33:08.759 --> 33:10.693
than you and I are.

33:10.727 --> 33:14.463
<i>[snarling and growling continue]</i>

33:14.498 --> 33:16.198
I envy you, brother.

33:17.834 --> 33:20.436
The time for you to walk
among the Resurrected is near.

I'm gonna <i> kill</i> you, you psychotic bastard.

33:29.012 --> 33:31.614
Don't you worry, sister.

33:31.648 --> 33:33.583
You won't be far behind your Charlie.

33:36.520 --> 33:37.386
Shoot him.

33:37.421 --> 33:39.255
I can't get a shot.

33:41.625 --> 33:42.959
I need to get on the roof.

33:42.993 --> 33:46.472
You get the truck.

33:46.572 --> 33:49.663
Rejoice as both of you will walk before
me the on road to every lasting life.

33:51.433 --> 33:53.000
[whispers] Listen, Jacob.

33:53.034 --> 33:56.236
Kill me, resurrect me, but spare the others.

33:58.673 --> 34:00.774
[whispers] Don't be afraid, brother.

34:00.809 --> 34:03.110
I send you to a better place.

34:03.144 --> 34:05.279
Blessed is the path before him!

34:05.313 --> 34:07.881
I am the new resurrection and the life.

34:07.916 --> 34:11.552
Whoever believes in me,
though he die, yet shall he live.

34:13.588 --> 34:16.356

34:29.670 --> 34:33.806
If you think the Resurrected
are one step closer to heaven

34:33.842 --> 34:36.710
then prepare to meet your new god.

34:40.715 --> 34:42.449
Come, brother.

34:43.318 --> 34:45.052
Step away from the Resurrected.

34:45.085 --> 34:47.221
That's no place for a mortal human.

34:47.255 --> 34:50.157
Come join our flock. All are welcome.

34:57.296 --> 35:02.167
I am not one of the Resurrected.

35:02.201 --> 35:03.935
I'm your messiah.

35:06.338 --> 35:08.439
That's blasphemy, brother.

35:08.474 --> 35:11.142
We can all see you're one of the living.

35:13.112 --> 35:15.146
Eight times!

35:15.714 --> 35:17.482
I was bitten

35:17.883 --> 35:19.851
and did not turn!

35:21.253 --> 35:25.990
<i> Eight times</i> I was infected
by their bloody saliva.

35:27.593 --> 35:30.528
And yet here I stand before you.

And I am here to tell you that <i> he</i>

35:35.234 --> 35:38.036

35:53.424 --> 35:55.158
[whispering] I have no idea.

35:55.459 --> 35:56.526
Kill the blasphemer.

35:57.628 --> 35:58.928
But the bites, Jacob.

35:58.963 --> 36:00.063
He's a false prophet!

36:00.097 --> 36:02.031
I can prove it!

36:02.066 --> 36:04.934
I can prove that my words are true.

36:04.969 --> 36:07.370
Tell us, blasphemer.

36:07.404 --> 36:11.407
How can you possibly
prove this outrageous lie?

I'll show you.

36:50.915 --> 36:53.049
[whispering] No. Just Murphy.

36:56.687 --> 36:58.688
Okay, that's enough of that.

37:02.426 --> 37:05.128
The Resurrected will not attack me

37:05.162 --> 37:07.463
because they love and fear me.

37:08.866 --> 37:11.167
Behold my flock.

37:12.169 --> 37:16.439
There's your proof, brothers and sisters!

Now let us go, Jacob,

[crying] Let's go.

41:23.720 --> 41:38.467
[melancholy guitar music plays]

41:38.502 --> 41:40.403
(Citizen Z) Someday maybe we'll find out

41:40.437 --> 41:43.205
the real reason the Zombie
Apocalypse happened.

41:43.807 --> 41:47.610
All this death and destruction.
All the pain and heartache.

41:47.878 --> 41:49.045
Who do we blame?

41:49.980 --> 41:52.415
Maybe it was a government
virus that escaped the lab.

41:52.449 --> 41:53.916
Maybe it was voodoo.

41:53.951 --> 41:56.152
Or maybe God just doesn't like us.

41:57.921 --> 41:59.355
Some days though

42:00.824 --> 42:04.193
I wonder if we brought this on ourselves.

42:04.227 --> 42:07.830
We had a chance to do this whole
planet earth thing right, and...

42:07.864 --> 42:11.243
and we blew it.

42:11.278 --> 42:13.545
We got the Apocalypse we deserved.

42:14.748 --> 42:16.215
But if we're lucky,

42:17.117 --> 42:19.685
some day this will all be over.

42:20.553 --> 42:21.587
I hope so.

42:23.890 --> 42:27.493
And next time, I hope we get it right.
