00:02.798 --> 00:05.398
Major Andre has informed me

00:05.400 --> 00:06.365
Long Island.

00:06.367 --> 00:07.500
You're Culper, aren't you?

00:07.502 --> 00:10.236
Let me propose we put aside our mistrust

00:10.238 --> 00:12.871
and kill this murdering bastard.

00:12.873 --> 00:14.973
She don't act married, now does she?

00:14.975 --> 00:16.708
Let them believe their gossip.

00:16.710 --> 00:19.210
Mrs. Arnold, this is Abraham Woodhull.

00:19.212 --> 00:20.278
I'm here with General Arnold.

00:20.280 --> 00:23.348
You come to spy on him, I can help.

00:23.350 --> 00:26.184
Man: Washington ordered a plan
to capture Arnold.

00:26.186 --> 00:27.453
Make contact with Townsend,

00:27.455 --> 00:29.988
then we will send our men into you.

Man: <i>So, Benedict
Arnold's your hero, then, huh?</i>

00:49.669 --> 00:51.469
Not saying he's a hero,

00:51.504 --> 00:54.371
just that he did what any man
might, given the circumstances.

00:54.407 --> 00:56.540
Circumstances?
What bloody circumstances?

00:56.576 --> 00:58.109
He's a traitor!

00:58.144 --> 00:59.829
Caleb: What's this bastard saying?

01:00.930 --> 01:03.546
We've got ourselves an Arnold lover.

01:04.006 --> 01:05.841
Is that right, Sergeant?

01:06.184 --> 01:07.784
Don't love the man.

01:07.820 --> 01:10.386
But do understand...

01:10.422 --> 01:12.122
Get him, Caleb!

- Traitor!

01:13.492 --> 01:16.459
- Aah!

Lieutenant Brewster, desist!
Brewster, desist!

01:19.931 --> 01:22.197

01:22.233 --> 01:25.200
The both of you with me, now!

01:26.203 --> 01:27.970
I said now!

01:31.009 --> 01:32.574
Get in.

01:36.580 --> 01:39.748
All right, well, that looked
realistic, I think.

01:39.783 --> 01:43.217
I tell you, the boy
really packs a punch.

01:43.629 --> 01:46.320
Oh, it's all right, Sergeant.
She's one of us.

01:46.356 --> 01:49.357
Mrs. Strong, this is
Sergeant John Champe,

01:49.392 --> 01:51.026
<i>of Major Harry Lee's regiment.</i>

01:51.061 --> 01:52.761
I've heard good things
about you, Sergeant.

01:52.796 --> 01:54.394
Your country thanks you
for your service.

01:55.031 --> 01:55.929
Ma'am.

01:55.965 --> 01:57.597
Ben: <i>Mrs. Strong will
be providing you with</i>

01:57.633 --> 02:00.210
a book of false intelligence
to take over to the enemy.

02:00.237 --> 02:03.071
<i>You'll be deserting for the
British lines tomorrow night.</i>

02:03.107 --> 02:05.307
You'll have no escort, no guide.

02:05.342 --> 02:08.042
A head start's the best
we can give you, Johnny,

02:08.078 --> 02:10.211
but then we gotta hunt you down.

02:10.247 --> 02:12.980
Major Lee tells me you...
you don't talk much.

02:14.034 --> 02:15.116
No, sir.

02:15.141 --> 02:16.650
Ben: <i> Right, well, once
you're in New York,</i>

02:16.685 --> 02:18.486
you'll have to do your share of talking.

02:18.521 --> 02:21.489
You must convince the enemy not
only that you have changed sides,

02:21.524 --> 02:22.923
but that others are soon to follow.

02:22.958 --> 02:24.725
This will get you close to your target.

02:24.760 --> 02:28.028
And remember, we want Arnold alive.

02:28.063 --> 02:29.529
I will see it done.

02:29.564 --> 02:31.764
Our agent will make contact
with you in the city.

02:31.799 --> 02:33.833
He'll introduce you to our
other man in New York,

02:33.868 --> 02:36.035
who will signal us when all is ready.

02:36.070 --> 02:37.903
How will I know him, sir?

02:37.939 --> 02:39.972
He's in Benedict Arnold's new regiment,

02:40.008 --> 02:41.674
the American Legion.

02:41.709 --> 02:45.511
He will respond to the phrase
"missing the summer of '73."

02:45.546 --> 02:48.347
Keep using the phrase,
and he will approach you.

02:50.251 --> 02:52.284
Good. Now...

02:52.319 --> 02:53.418

02:53.454 --> 02:56.255

<i>Betrayal.</i>

<i>Chaos.</i>

03:09.101 --> 03:11.369
These are the enemies that we face...

03:11.404 --> 03:13.638
the enemies of truth.

03:13.673 --> 03:15.306
To me, the truth seems quite clear.

03:15.341 --> 03:16.707
It was rebels behind the ambush.

03:16.742 --> 03:18.442
Rebels who killed their own?

03:18.478 --> 03:21.211
Yes, they are both savage
and incompetent, trust me.

03:22.414 --> 03:25.182
What do you make
of that assessment, Abraham?

03:25.217 --> 03:27.551
That the rebels are savages?

03:27.586 --> 03:28.661
I, um...

03:30.110 --> 03:32.422
I can't be sure
if they <i> were</i> rebels, sir.

03:32.457 --> 03:33.690
I can.

03:33.725 --> 03:35.458
And, yes, they would kill their own.

03:35.494 --> 03:37.626
<i>Treachery runs in their blood.</i>

03:37.662 --> 03:38.994
Does it, now?

03:40.831 --> 03:43.098
General, I wonder if I might

03:43.133 --> 03:46.084
interview Private Woodhull on my own.

03:46.537 --> 03:48.253
So, you two know each other well, then.

03:48.806 --> 03:50.206
Oh, quite well.

03:50.241 --> 03:52.591
Major Hewlett was billeted
at my father's house.

03:53.577 --> 03:55.510
There's not much we don't
know about each other.

03:55.845 --> 03:58.680
Though I must confess, Major,
you have me at a disadvantage.

03:59.482 --> 04:01.416
We had heard you had
moved back to England.

04:03.220 --> 04:05.453
What brings you back to the Colonies?

04:06.923 --> 04:09.024
Oh, it's a long story, I'm afraid.

04:09.359 --> 04:12.359
And we are here today to discuss yours

04:12.394 --> 04:15.329
and to secure the justice
that you deserve.

04:15.364 --> 04:17.897
And rightful recompense.

04:17.933 --> 04:20.285
I heard one of them
call the other by a name.

04:20.702 --> 04:22.079
Thorburn.

04:22.838 --> 04:24.122
Thorburn.

04:25.173 --> 04:26.773
Well, that's a start.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.474
<i>I shall contact my sources</i>

04:28.509 --> 04:32.578
<i>and seek to identify
the culp-rits of this crime.</i>

04:32.614 --> 04:36.716
And I assume those culp-able

04:36.751 --> 04:39.619
will have made the wise
choice to flee this colony.

04:39.654 --> 04:42.588
<i>And if they have not,
they will be caught</i>

04:42.624 --> 04:44.089
<i>and hanged.</i>

04:44.125 --> 04:45.323
Very good.

04:45.359 --> 04:46.958
<i>Thank you, General.</i>

04:49.329 --> 04:51.229
So, that's our head of intelligence.

04:51.265 --> 04:52.764
Hewlett: Uh, General?

04:53.933 --> 04:56.368
<i>Please allow me at least 24 hours</i>

04:56.403 --> 04:58.202

08:18.635 --> 08:20.801
Well, he can. But he didn't.

Mrs. Woodhull, I have made

08:53.234 --> 08:57.202
That women are not allowed in
the officers' tents, I know.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.304
Though that rule is broken regularly.

08:59.339 --> 09:00.872
- Mary...
- But this isn't your tent,

09:00.908 --> 09:02.674
so I haven't broken your precious rule.

09:02.710 --> 09:05.276
You also said I had no right

09:05.312 --> 09:06.979
But I see that she has that right.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.747
- You have no...
- We're being watched.

09:08.782 --> 09:11.416
There are spies in camp
almost certainly.

09:11.451 --> 09:14.085
The fewer people who know a secret,

09:14.120 --> 09:16.120
the more secret it is,
that's all this is about.

09:16.155 --> 09:18.589
Are you saying that you don't trust me?

And I'll be in Miss Lola's tent

13:34.009 --> 13:36.210
killing time till you do.

Cicero?

13:53.027 --> 13:56.596
Yes, ma'am. My mother's at the market.

13:56.631 --> 13:59.098
I know, dear. I have a question for you.

13:59.133 --> 14:01.533
You see, I'm writing
my friend Becky Redman

14:01.569 --> 14:04.336
back in Philadelphia,
and I'm such a scatterbrain.

14:04.372 --> 14:07.138
I can't remember the name
of that nice young soldier

14:07.174 --> 14:09.441
I met at Kennedy House the other night.

14:09.477 --> 14:11.677
The young man, what was his name?

14:11.712 --> 14:13.746
- Soldier?
- Oh, silly me.

14:13.781 --> 14:16.181
There were so many there, I know.

14:16.216 --> 14:20.259
The one I saw you talking to.
In the cloakroom?

14:21.220 --> 14:22.353
Um...

14:24.156 --> 14:27.825
I don't... I don't remember, ma'am.

14:27.861 --> 14:29.927
He was from Setauket.
And you're from Setauket.

14:29.962 --> 14:32.096
You must know who I mean.

14:32.131 --> 14:37.166
Private Ward, Widdell, Weston...

14:37.202 --> 14:38.334
Woodhull.

14:41.239 --> 14:42.873
His name was Woodhull, ma'am.

14:42.908 --> 14:45.159
Of course it was. Thank you.

14:45.544 --> 14:49.622
And by the way, what were you
two chatting about in there?

14:50.716 --> 14:54.316
We talked about... Setauket.

14:54.351 --> 14:55.818
How he missed it.

14:55.853 --> 14:59.588
I see. Do you miss it as well?

14:59.624 --> 15:03.191
- I like it here, ma'am.
- Thank you, Cicero.

15:11.401 --> 15:14.068
<i>- (Music playing)
- (people chattering)</i>

15:51.005 --> 15:52.263
What is this about?

15:53.541 --> 15:55.146
How do you knew Hewlett?

15:55.643 --> 16:00.679
- Who?
- How long have you known Hewlett?

16:00.714 --> 16:02.113
- Major...
- Yes, Major Hewlett!

16:02.148 --> 16:04.572
I saw you speaking with him last night!

16:05.986 --> 16:07.853
You saw a man paying his bill,

16:07.888 --> 16:09.454
which is a rare sight in these parts,

16:09.490 --> 16:11.823
but I assure you it does
happen from time to time.

16:11.859 --> 16:14.593
Now, what are you getting at,
and why are you hiding a knife?

16:17.730 --> 16:19.262
You seem to know each other.

16:21.834 --> 16:24.334
I make it my business to know
every officer

16:24.370 --> 16:27.972
that frequents the coffeehouse,
so why is this one so different?

16:30.409 --> 16:32.275
Because he knows I'm Culper.

16:32.311 --> 16:36.145
Now, I need to know exactly
what he said to you.

16:36.180 --> 16:38.381
(Sighs) Uh...

16:38.416 --> 16:40.449
we talked about some new planet

16:40.485 --> 16:43.252
and some book about the Roman Empire.

16:43.287 --> 16:45.613
- Why hasn't he arrested you?
- I don't know!

16:46.357 --> 16:48.290
We made a pact to kill Simcoe
back in Setauket,

16:48.326 --> 16:50.359
but it didn't work,
and then he quit his post

16:50.395 --> 16:53.121
after my father blocked
his marriage to Anna Strong.

16:53.864 --> 16:56.732
How have I never heard of this person?

16:56.767 --> 16:58.700
We thought he was gone.

16:58.736 --> 16:59.835
The last we heard, he was selling

16:59.870 --> 17:01.069
his commission.

17:01.104 --> 17:02.738
Does he know about me? Should I run?

17:04.575 --> 17:06.842
No, I'm going to deal with
him before he deals with us.

17:06.877 --> 17:10.310
But you might wanna pack a bag.
Just in case.

17:11.614 --> 17:12.847
Wait.

17:17.252 --> 17:18.752
I know where he lives.

17:20.757 --> 17:22.321
Pays his bill on time.

Your forces are in the north. He knew...

17:56.584 --> 17:59.352
May I introduce my aide,
Major Tallmadge?

17:59.387 --> 18:02.010
(Speaking French)

18:02.276 --> 18:04.123
Monsieur Le Comte De Rochambeau

18:04.159 --> 18:06.986
in command of our French allies.

18:08.396 --> 18:11.929
Retaking New York must be
our first objective

18:11.964 --> 18:13.465
in the coming campaign.

18:13.500 --> 18:17.769
- (Translating to French)
- Without New York, we cannot win.

18:21.608 --> 18:23.508
(Speaking French)

18:25.179 --> 18:27.811
I too am of the opinion that
we should attack New York,

18:27.846 --> 18:30.214
when the time is ripe.

18:30.249 --> 18:34.222
Perhaps, however, the South
offers fresher fruit.

18:34.820 --> 18:36.554
If I may add, I hear that General Greene

18:36.589 --> 18:38.822
has been making great sport
of Lord Cornwallis there.

18:38.857 --> 18:42.092
Hunting a fox is not the
same as killing the wolf.

18:42.127 --> 18:44.827
Wolves may be dressed
in sheep's clothing.

18:44.862 --> 18:46.150
(Clears throat)

18:47.131 --> 18:50.266
One option is to concentrate our forces

18:50.302 --> 18:52.797
and besiege the city
as Admiral De Grasse harries...

18:52.822 --> 18:53.836
<i> (translating to French)</i>

18:53.871 --> 18:57.106
...the Royal Navy to cut off
General Clinton's supplies.

19:02.079 --> 19:04.613
I concur that that is indeed an option.

19:04.648 --> 19:07.949
- New York is critical to a successful...
- <i> (translating to French)</i>

19:07.984 --> 19:10.719
and rapid conclusion to this war.

19:15.025 --> 19:19.327
I could not disagree less given a
favorable alignment of circumstances,

19:19.362 --> 19:20.695
climate, and conditions.

19:22.398 --> 19:24.998
So, cut off the head and the beast dies.

19:30.540 --> 19:33.574
Slicing into his soft
underbelly achieves the same.

19:36.378 --> 19:40.480
- Yeah.
- My dear <i> Comte,</i> I greatly appreciate

19:40.515 --> 19:44.150
this full and frank exchange of views.

19:54.762 --> 19:56.862
The pleasure was entirely
mine, Your Excellency.

19:56.897 --> 19:59.732
It is important that we allies
understand each other clearly.

20:05.573 --> 20:06.838
<i>Monsieur.</i>

20:10.343 --> 20:13.529
I'll start drawing up the plans
for the siege on New York.

20:14.180 --> 20:17.081
The French want to attack the South.

20:17.700 --> 20:19.994
Could they be right, sir?

20:20.920 --> 20:25.022
The prize lies within our grasp,

20:25.458 --> 20:27.758
and they wish to settle for fool's gold.

My. Dear.

21:34.556 --> 21:36.362
Yes, what is it?

21:37.091 --> 21:39.325
Are you certain you can trust Cicero?

21:39.361 --> 21:41.594
Trust him? What are you talking about?

21:41.629 --> 21:43.128
It's just that I saw him talking

21:43.164 --> 21:46.080
to a Private Woodhull at Kennedy House.

21:46.634 --> 21:50.302
Just enlisted. Rebels killed his father.

21:50.338 --> 21:55.139
Oh. Still, they seemed
very conspiratorial.

21:55.175 --> 21:56.808
Perhaps it bears looking into?

21:56.844 --> 21:58.610
Look, I am a damned general,
in case you've forgotten.

21:58.645 --> 22:00.011
Do you think I have the
time to poke around

22:00.046 --> 22:02.013
in the lives of servants and privates?

22:02.048 --> 22:03.556
- I didn't mean...
- Do you think Washington

22:03.591 --> 22:06.351
concerns himself with the idiocies
of scullery maids?

22:06.387 --> 22:07.951
Do you think that Clinton
cares about the vaporings

22:07.987 --> 22:09.420
- of his footmen?
- It's just that...

22:09.455 --> 22:11.989
Then why in the hell
do you think I should?

22:14.527 --> 22:17.961

22:17.997 --> 22:19.397
You only with to what?

22:19.432 --> 22:22.232
To manipulate me
like you did with Miss Cheer,

22:22.268 --> 22:24.167
your rival for André's affections?

22:24.203 --> 22:26.469
- Oh, Benedict, please st...
- No, you stop!

22:26.505 --> 22:28.805
I see your stratagem now.

22:31.309 --> 22:33.910
- Abigail!
- <i>(footsteps approaching)</i>

22:36.915 --> 22:41.583
<i>Abigail, understand this.
You are my servant.</i>

22:41.619 --> 22:44.085
Cicero is my servant and my valet,

22:44.121 --> 22:45.654
and he is privileged to serve as such.

22:45.689 --> 22:46.955
Yes, sir. He knows that, sir.

22:46.990 --> 22:48.557
<i>You will not beg and harass my wife</i>

22:48.592 --> 22:51.059
to dismiss him behind
my back, is that clear?

22:51.094 --> 22:52.728
Don't look at her. Look at me.

22:52.763 --> 22:54.996
I am master of this house.

22:55.032 --> 22:56.565
Yes, sir.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.066
You may leave.

23:05.809 --> 23:09.076
That was unnecessary and misguided.

23:11.881 --> 23:16.086
Yes, I acted foolishly
with that... actress,

23:16.752 --> 23:20.687
but now I am only looking out
for your interests.

23:20.722 --> 23:23.256
<i>Our</i> interests as your wife.

23:23.291 --> 23:26.493
Well, then let me be frank
with you, wife.

23:26.528 --> 23:28.929
Your opinions, especially on matters

23:28.964 --> 23:32.698
that do not concern you,
no longer concern me.

23:32.733 --> 23:35.935
It's time for you to honor the
contract of this marriage.

23:35.970 --> 23:37.703
You will fulfill your obligations,

23:37.738 --> 23:38.838
you will service my needs,

23:38.873 --> 23:40.205
You will provide me with sons,

23:40.240 --> 23:41.406
and the social standing

23:41.442 --> 23:43.476
that my rank requires, is that clear?

23:46.213 --> 23:47.746
Abundantly.

31:13.742 --> 31:16.377
- (groans)
- What the hell are you doing here, boy?

31:18.881 --> 31:21.282
He was looking for me, just as you were.

31:21.317 --> 31:23.017
- Turn him.

31:23.052 --> 31:24.985

(gurgling)

32:00.746 --> 32:02.679
(panting)

32:05.058 --> 32:06.891
He's Simcoe's man.

32:06.926 --> 32:08.785
No, he's more than that.

32:09.429 --> 32:13.431
He's proof of Simcoe's plot
to murder me.

32:13.466 --> 32:15.417
Simcoe'll just say he's a loose cannon.

32:16.828 --> 32:18.094
He has another man outside.

32:38.489 --> 32:40.722
I just had this place cleaned.

32:45.696 --> 32:47.491
Where the hell did you get that?

32:48.433 --> 32:53.134
This? It's a souvenir

32:53.170 --> 32:55.903
my uncle acquired at Culloden.

32:55.939 --> 32:58.273
Belonged to some unfortunate Jacobite.

33:00.377 --> 33:05.175
I brought it over with me. Just in case.

33:06.148 --> 33:08.615
You mean brought it back with you.

33:13.021 --> 33:17.854
When I returned home, I tried
to sell my commission.

33:18.961 --> 33:22.067
Only to find out that it was worthless.

33:22.731 --> 33:26.165
No takers for a losing war, it seems.

33:26.201 --> 33:30.903
So, I'm here to recoup my investment.

33:32.107 --> 33:36.609
Oh. So, that's what your scheme's about.

33:38.045 --> 33:40.312
Fake tips from fake
informants for real money?

33:40.347 --> 33:42.414
(Sighs)

33:42.449 --> 33:45.150
You always were a clever one, Abraham.

33:45.185 --> 33:47.852
I got the idea from your
fake Sons of Liberty.

33:47.887 --> 33:49.654
You remember that?

33:49.689 --> 33:51.189
I remember getting caught.

33:51.225 --> 33:53.348
Yes, well, no one's watching me here.

33:54.027 --> 33:59.763
No one cares. They think that
intelligence is a fool's errand.

34:01.066 --> 34:03.300
But they're certainly
willing to pay for it.

34:05.505 --> 34:06.679
How much?

34:06.704 --> 34:10.031
A thousand pounds
a month for tips alone.

34:11.183 --> 34:15.184
Another few years, and I'll be
able to purchase a decent estate.

34:15.313 --> 34:18.281
Not as nice as the one bought
by Colonel Cook's graft,

34:18.315 --> 34:21.684
but enough to get what I care about.

34:24.721 --> 34:26.717
You know, Anna's already had that life.

34:26.742 --> 34:28.175
Anna?

34:29.158 --> 34:32.792
No. No.

34:34.362 --> 34:37.842
What I'm talking about is my true love.

34:38.833 --> 34:40.270
My first love.

34:41.003 --> 34:47.206
Science. My telescopes,
my books. Myself.

34:50.110 --> 34:52.157
It is all the company I need.

34:53.746 --> 34:56.246
But solitude does not come cheap.

35:02.956 --> 35:04.878
If we don't deal with Simcoe...

35:06.926 --> 35:08.426
it won't come at all.

35:08.461 --> 35:11.635
- We?
- Yes, we.

35:12.298 --> 35:17.223
We made a pact once... to finish him.

35:18.004 --> 35:20.571
And we have both paid the price
for not seeing it through.

35:20.606 --> 35:22.605
It's not going to matter.

35:22.641 --> 35:26.243
Someone else far likely worse
will replace him.

35:26.278 --> 35:28.512
It doesn't get worse than Simcoe.

35:33.385 --> 35:35.450
I turned you in, Abraham.

35:36.422 --> 35:40.089
<i>Before I left, I turned you in to André.</i>

35:41.792 --> 35:43.292
<i>And when I returned to England,</i>

35:43.327 --> 35:45.594
I found that he had met his doom.

35:45.629 --> 35:47.696
Benedict Arnold
had been awarded a regiment,

35:47.731 --> 35:50.799
and there was nary a mention...

35:51.708 --> 35:53.575
of a spy named Woodhull.

35:57.707 --> 36:00.808
I once believed that man's
affairs had a purpose.

36:00.843 --> 36:05.447
The order we brought
was divinely ordained.

36:07.150 --> 36:11.987
But you see, there is no order.
No justice.

36:12.989 --> 36:17.224
Men are nothing but creatures
of deceit, folly, and greed.

36:19.128 --> 36:21.538
<i>Why should I be any different?</i>

36:23.065 --> 36:27.667
All right, then. All right,
then let's play greed.

36:27.703 --> 36:30.869
Drop this scheme right now,

36:30.905 --> 36:33.008
and I will give you what you're after.

36:33.941 --> 36:34.940
What do you mean?

36:34.976 --> 36:37.643
I mean I'll give you Whitehall.

36:37.678 --> 36:39.778
My father signed it over to
me, but I don't want it.

36:39.814 --> 36:43.916
In fact, I hate it.
Almost as much as I hate Simcoe.

36:43.951 --> 36:48.753
Now, help me kill him...
and I'll sign it over to you.

36:50.157 --> 36:51.789
Sell it.

36:51.825 --> 36:54.070
Live in it. Burn it down.

36:55.996 --> 36:57.662
I don't care.

37:04.201 --> 37:05.836
<i>(Distant chatter)</i>

37:07.606 --> 37:10.039
Simcoe: I should warn you,
that blade has brought death

37:10.074 --> 37:14.811
to many and pain enough
to make others long for it.

37:14.846 --> 37:20.817
But it's never brought
fear to you before now.

37:20.852 --> 37:22.432
I'm not afraid.

37:23.721 --> 37:27.155
(Chuckles) Because you
trust I won't hurt you.

37:27.190 --> 37:28.990
Because I trust that if you do,

37:29.025 --> 37:31.893
you know the consequences
would be fatal.

37:31.929 --> 37:35.111
Maybe I've seen so much,

37:35.866 --> 37:39.200
I don't fear consequences.

37:39.235 --> 37:40.802
(Gasping)

37:46.642 --> 37:51.612
Does it feel good to take your armor off

37:51.647 --> 37:54.648
and put yourself in my hands?

37:54.684 --> 37:58.519
- Tell me.
- Yes.

37:58.554 --> 38:01.596
You don't take me like other men do.

38:02.123 --> 38:06.425
You want me to like it, too. Why?

38:06.461 --> 38:08.828
I don't know.

38:08.864 --> 38:13.332
I think it's because you
want me to feel something.

38:13.368 --> 38:15.635
You want to see just a little bit

38:15.670 --> 38:19.337
of love in my eyes.

38:20.941 --> 38:23.108
- Don't deny it.
- (moans)

38:23.143 --> 38:25.010
Don't fear it.

38:27.080 --> 38:29.948
Oh, to care what other people think,

38:29.984 --> 38:33.084
even people you barely know,

38:33.120 --> 38:36.020
maybe that's the way
to the love you want.

38:39.726 --> 38:43.293
Say my name. Say it.

38:43.329 --> 38:44.996
Say it. Say it.

38:45.031 --> 38:46.463
Man: <i>Colonel Simcoe?</i>

38:49.201 --> 38:51.467
<i>(music playing)</i>

39:04.616 --> 39:08.684
Hewlett did it. Threw him
right out the window.

39:09.053 --> 39:12.788
Hewlett did this? All by himself?

39:15.192 --> 39:17.760
Take it north. Find a ditch.
Throw him in it.

39:34.377 --> 39:38.412
- (People chattering)
- Ann: Cheer up, love.

39:38.448 --> 39:41.882
All our problems come out in the wash.

39:41.917 --> 39:45.953
- Not all, Mrs. Barnes.
- Well, look on the bright sides.

39:45.988 --> 39:48.722
Your boy here is a smart one.

39:48.757 --> 39:51.372
And so good with his letters.

39:51.994 --> 39:54.127
Can even write his real name.

39:57.967 --> 39:59.380
I beg your pardon?

39:59.867 --> 40:02.167
While you were off with the queen...

40:05.112 --> 40:06.946
we practiced our schooling.

40:08.977 --> 40:12.244
Of the Long Island Woodhulls, I presume?

40:12.279 --> 40:17.357
The very well-known,
very Tory Woodhulls?

40:18.085 --> 40:19.651
Thomas, come here.

40:19.686 --> 40:22.286
Shh, don't worry. Don't worry.

40:22.322 --> 40:24.781
Your secret's safe with me, love.

40:25.458 --> 40:28.226
You might have slipped up,
but we can remedy that.

40:30.030 --> 40:34.164
But if you don't take care,
they will spot us.

40:36.568 --> 40:38.135
Us?

40:38.170 --> 40:41.404
You're not the only one
in camp under a false name.

40:43.375 --> 40:45.208
Mine isn't Barnes.

40:45.244 --> 40:48.278
It's Bates. Ann Bates.

40:50.214 --> 40:52.684
We Tories have to stick together,

40:53.317 --> 40:55.952
before these rebel bastards
drag us all into hell.

40:57.722 --> 41:00.723
Now, tell me.

41:00.759 --> 41:03.159
What do you know about Miss Anna Strong,

41:03.194 --> 41:05.261
and her beau, Major Tallmadge.

41:17.107 --> 41:19.274
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I'll do this elsewhere.

41:19.309 --> 41:21.476
Not until you tell me truthfully.

41:21.511 --> 41:24.545
What did you discuss
with Abraham Woodhull?

41:24.580 --> 41:27.782
- I...
- I know it was about the general.

41:27.817 --> 41:30.617
- Now tell me.
- <i>(footsteps approaching)</i>

41:30.653 --> 41:33.888
Miss Peggy? Cicero, what did you do?

41:33.923 --> 41:38.258
We're just about to find out. Cicero?

41:40.629 --> 41:42.962
<i>(Music playing)</i>

41:51.372 --> 41:55.246
My grandfather used to horsewhip
servants who lied to him.

41:55.711 --> 41:57.677
My father, a kindlier man,

41:57.712 --> 42:00.145
always taught me to reward loyalty.

42:04.685 --> 42:06.952
Which do you prefer, boy?

42:12.693 --> 42:13.859
He's a spy.

42:15.608 --> 42:17.095
For the rebel army.

42:18.798 --> 42:22.834
He came to kidnap General Arnold.

42:26.439 --> 42:27.939
A plot?

42:37.649 --> 42:38.882
Count me in.
