00:03.471 --> 00:06.440
Rarity: I'm so sorry I lost
track of time on our picnic.

00:06.474 --> 00:09.177
I didn't mean for us to get
caught out here after dark,

00:09.210 --> 00:12.046
but there's really
nothing to be afraid of.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.682
The forest at night is the same
as the forest during the day...

00:14.715 --> 00:18.552
[whistling wind]

00:18.586 --> 00:21.255
...only darker.

00:21.289 --> 00:22.190
[thud]

00:22.223 --> 00:24.058
[teeth chattering]

00:24.092 --> 00:26.660
Still, maybe we should
hurry back to the cottage.

00:26.694 --> 00:27.595
[whoosh]

00:30.464 --> 00:32.066
Nothing to worry
about. No reason to...

00:32.100 --> 00:33.767
[rustling]

00:33.801 --> 00:37.571
[scary moaning]

00:37.605 --> 00:39.107
RUN!

00:40.141 --> 00:41.642
AAAHHHH!

00:41.675 --> 00:43.444
[fearful whimpering]

00:43.477 --> 00:45.813
[scary moaning]

00:46.680 --> 00:47.648
[thunderclap]

00:50.418 --> 00:52.453
[roar]

00:52.486 --> 00:54.054
[scream]

00:56.124 --> 01:00.361
Haw! Haw! Haw!

01:02.330 --> 01:05.499
Got ya! Ha ha ha!

01:05.533 --> 01:09.470
[gasping]

01:09.503 --> 01:12.640
That wasn't funny.
You really scared me.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.208
I hope you're happy.

01:14.242 --> 01:15.343
[low snarl]

01:16.777 --> 01:20.814
Nope. You're too easy.
You're scared of everything.

01:20.848 --> 01:22.416
That's not true!

01:23.684 --> 01:24.518
Boo.

01:24.552 --> 01:25.519
AAAHHHH!

01:25.553 --> 01:27.721
[chattering teeth]

01:33.361 --> 01:36.664
* My little pony,
my little pony *

01:36.697 --> 01:39.133
* Aaaahhh

01:39.167 --> 01:41.202
* My little Pony

01:41.235 --> 01:43.604
* I used to wonder what
friendship could be. *

01:43.637 --> 01:45.473
* My Little Pony

01:45.506 --> 01:47.875
* Until you all shared
its magic with me. *

01:47.908 --> 01:50.144
* Big adventure!
* Tons of fun

01:50.178 --> 01:52.313
* A beautiful heart! *
Faithful and strong! *

01:52.346 --> 01:54.448
* Sharing kindness
* it's an easy feat

01:54.482 --> 01:56.450
* And magic makes it
all complete! *

01:56.484 --> 01:58.586
* To have my little pony

01:58.619 --> 02:01.889
* Do you know you're all
my very best friends? *

02:01.922 --> 02:04.425
**

02:09.563 --> 02:13.201
I mean, how could you
not appreciate that?

02:13.234 --> 02:16.637
Because I don't think
being scared is very fun.

02:16.670 --> 02:19.273
I do! Your heart
gets all racey!

02:19.307 --> 02:24.178
Your hooves get all tingly.
Your mouth gets all dry-y.

02:24.212 --> 02:27.448
Actually, I don't like that
part, but the rest is great!

02:27.481 --> 02:31.752
See? Everypony likes a good
prank. They're just jokes.

02:31.785 --> 02:33.654
Rarity: Now, Rainbow Dash,

02:33.687 --> 02:35.789
I don't think Fluttershy
would have called us all here

02:35.823 --> 02:38.292
to talk about this if she
thought it was funny.

02:38.326 --> 02:41.295
Everypony has things they
like and things they don't.

02:41.329 --> 02:43.631
And scaring Fluttershy
is just lazy.

02:43.664 --> 02:46.367
LAZY?

02:46.400 --> 02:47.668
A prank isn't
very good

02:47.701 --> 02:49.503
if you're the only
pony laughing.

02:49.537 --> 02:51.305
But what if it's really,
really, really, really,

02:51.339 --> 02:52.906
really, really funny?

02:52.940 --> 02:54.942
And I can do funny.

02:54.975 --> 02:57.611
I know you can. I guess
the trick is making sure

02:57.645 --> 02:58.946
that your idea of funny

02:58.979 --> 03:00.681
matches the pony you're
pranking. That way-

03:00.714 --> 03:04.285
[fart sound]

03:04.318 --> 03:07.755
[laugh]

03:07.788 --> 03:11.259
[giggles]

03:11.292 --> 03:15.663
[screaming laughter]

03:15.696 --> 03:19.867
Good one, Rainbow! You have
to admit. That was funny.

03:20.901 --> 03:22.436
Not really.

03:22.470 --> 03:25.739
Yeah. A whoopee cushion
is like a joke shortcut.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.308
WHAT!?

03:27.341 --> 03:28.576
Rainbow: Honestly, Rainbow Dash,

03:28.609 --> 03:30.744
if you are not willing
to put forth the effort

03:30.778 --> 03:33.414
required to pull a prank
that everypony can enjoy,

03:33.447 --> 03:35.316
you may as well not
pull one at all.

03:37.017 --> 03:39.787
Fine. If you ponies
want effort,

03:39.820 --> 03:41.422
then that's just
what you'll get.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.726
I'm not sure she
understood what we meant.

03:47.861 --> 03:50.398
I know you're excited about
the Filly Guide cookie drive,

03:50.431 --> 03:52.466
but I still have to do
a few finishing touches

03:52.500 --> 03:53.601
on your uniform.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.910
Mmmm. Not bad.

04:02.943 --> 04:06.547
Hmm. "You asked for it."

04:06.580 --> 04:08.015
What does it mean?

04:08.048 --> 04:11.985
Hmm. I assume this is
Dash's idea of a prank.

04:12.019 --> 04:14.455
Which can only mean she's
rigged some kind of booby trap

04:14.488 --> 04:16.824
to your Filly Guide
uniform up there.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.892
So... how do we
get it down?

04:18.926 --> 04:21.429
We don't. If Dash thinks
I'm going to fall

04:21.462 --> 04:22.730
for whatever she's
got in mind,

04:22.763 --> 04:24.532
she's got another
thing coming.

04:24.565 --> 04:26.600
There's more uniforms
where that one came from.

04:33.807 --> 04:35.476
Mmm. The sewing machine
cake is actually better

04:35.509 --> 04:37.545
than the cake cake!

04:37.578 --> 04:39.580
RAINBOW DASH!

04:39.613 --> 04:46.387
[laughing]GOTCHA! Ha ha!
How's that for effort?

04:53.794 --> 04:54.762
[clang]

04:56.430 --> 04:57.731
What's all this, Applejack?

04:57.765 --> 04:59.767
I thought you were
gonna help me get ready

04:59.800 --> 05:01.602
for the Filly
Guide Cookie drive.

05:01.635 --> 05:04.872
Uh, yeah. Sorry about that,
but Rainbow Dash has been

05:04.905 --> 05:08.342
on a pranking tear and you
can never be too careful.

05:08.376 --> 05:10.578
Do you really think Dash
is gonna try to prank you

05:10.611 --> 05:11.812
in your sleep?

05:11.845 --> 05:13.947
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.082
[click]

05:15.115 --> 05:16.650
See you in the
morning, sugar cube.

05:25.125 --> 05:25.993

05:26.026 --> 05:27.495
Huh?

05:27.528 --> 05:28.662

Got ya!

07:09.497 --> 07:11.699
Pinkie, we need
your help.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.534
OK!

07:13.567 --> 07:14.835
For what?

07:14.868 --> 07:17.070
Are you honestly going to
stand there and tell us

07:17.104 --> 07:18.972
you know nothing about all
the pranking Rainbow Dash

07:19.006 --> 07:20.240
has been doing?

07:20.273 --> 07:23.511
Oh, no. She's been
pranking up a storm!

07:23.544 --> 07:25.245
Did she get you, too?

07:25.278 --> 07:27.848
[laughs] Oh, yeah.
She and Gummy both...

07:30.984 --> 07:31.819
Boo.

07:31.852 --> 07:36.156
AHH-HAHAHA!

07:36.189 --> 07:38.492
They got me good.

07:38.526 --> 07:40.160
Well, she needs to stop.

07:40.193 --> 07:43.063
Stop? But pranks
are so much fun.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.666
Not for everypony and it
doesn't seem like Dash

07:45.699 --> 07:47.868
is taking the time to
find out who enjoys them

07:47.901 --> 07:49.036
and who doesn't.

07:51.138 --> 07:54.508
Uh, since you and Dash
share such an... affinity

07:54.542 --> 07:58.045
for pranking, we thought you
might be able to get her to,

07:58.078 --> 08:00.614
um... quit it.

08:10.257 --> 08:12.159
Hey, Rainbow Dash!

08:12.192 --> 08:15.596
I have something very
important to tell you.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.097
Pinkie! Hey.

08:17.130 --> 08:20.668
I actually have something
totally important to tell you!

08:20.701 --> 08:22.736
You do? Oh.
You go first!

08:24.838 --> 08:28.141
OK, you know how I've
been pranking everypony?

08:28.175 --> 08:31.311
Yeah. It's been
pretty funny.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.581
I-I mean, actually,

08:33.614 --> 08:36.249
that's what I have
to talk to you about.

08:36.283 --> 08:37.618
Here, have a cookie.

08:37.651 --> 08:38.852
Oooh. Thanks.

08:40.788 --> 08:43.156
So I got to thinking,
why waste my time

08:43.190 --> 08:45.726
pranking every
pony one at a time,

08:45.759 --> 08:48.228
when I could prank
everypony at once!?

08:48.261 --> 08:53.601
Wow. Everypony at
once? That sounds amazing.

08:53.634 --> 08:56.904
Uh. Wait. I mean,
it's not...

08:56.937 --> 08:59.339
You don't even know
what it is yet.

08:59.372 --> 09:02.910
Pinkie, this is going to
be the best prank ever!

09:02.943 --> 09:05.312
I special ordered
these joke cookies

09:05.345 --> 09:07.681
so the colors would
match my mane.

09:07.715 --> 09:08.849
And...?

09:08.882 --> 09:13.086
And I'm gonna switch them
with the Filly Guide Cookies.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.988
When Scootaloo and
her friends sell them,

09:15.022 --> 09:18.091
everypony in town's gonna
get a rainbow mouth,

09:18.125 --> 09:23.230
courtesy of Rainbow Dash, ha
ha! It's gonna be so awesome.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.967
Uh, I don't know.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.737
I mean, it doesn't really
seem all that funny.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.271
WHAT!?

09:31.304 --> 09:34.274
Maybe this is a good time to
stop pranking for a while.

09:34.307 --> 09:35.943
The other ponies
in town have--

09:35.976 --> 09:40.648
STOP!? No way! This prank
is happening, Pinkie.

09:40.681 --> 09:43.183
And it's going to
be hilarious!

09:46.887 --> 09:48.021
[munch]

09:55.729 --> 09:59.232
Pinkie! What's the deal? I
told you I needed your help

09:59.266 --> 10:00.868
switching out all the
Filly Guide Cookies

10:00.901 --> 10:02.069
for the joke cookies.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.905
But when you didn't show, I
had to do it all by myself!

10:07.407 --> 10:08.909
Uh, Pinkie?

10:08.942 --> 10:10.177
[cough]

10:12.713 --> 10:15.749
Wow. Your face is
still pretty rainbowed.

10:15.783 --> 10:20.153
Yeah. I haven't really [cough]
[cough] been feeling well,

10:20.187 --> 10:21.955
and these joke cookies
are the only thing

10:21.989 --> 10:23.757
that makes me feel better.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.328
You don't have any
more, do you?

10:28.361 --> 10:31.899
Uh, no. I just told you. I
used them all for the prank.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.734
Oh.

10:33.767 --> 10:36.036
Pretty soon, the CMCs
will start selling them

10:36.069 --> 10:37.905
to every pony in town.

10:37.938 --> 10:40.207
Ponies will open their
boxes and start eating.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.409
Then all of their teeth
will turn rainbow-colored

10:42.442 --> 10:44.377
and they'll know it was me.

10:44.411 --> 10:47.748
It's gonna be so awesome! Come
on. You don't want to miss it.

10:47.781 --> 10:53.220
Actually, [cough] I don't
think I can even stand up...

10:53.253 --> 10:55.723
UNLESS YOU'VE GOT
MORE COOKIES!

10:55.756 --> 11:00.728
Agh! On second thought, maybe
you better stay here and rest.

11:00.761 --> 11:03.330
[sigh] Yeah. You're right.

11:03.363 --> 11:07.100
Sorry to miss out. I'm sure
it's going to be hilarious.

11:18.846 --> 11:22.149

to sell some cookies?

11:22.182 --> 11:23.483
All: ME!

11:23.516 --> 11:25.085
Look, here, Rainbow Dash.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.721
I know you promised
Scootaloo you'd help out,

11:27.755 --> 11:29.422
but I don't want
none of your pranks

11:29.456 --> 11:31.324
ruinin' these
fillies' night.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.460
Look, I'll be with
you the whole night

11:33.493 --> 11:35.929
so you can totally
keep an eye on me.

11:35.963 --> 11:38.498
Come on, Applejack,
let's get started.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.201
Yeah! We've got a lot
of ground to cover.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.136
We wanna hit every
house in Ponyville!

11:43.170 --> 11:46.106

11:46.139 --> 11:50.210
Come on! You heard her.
Every house in Ponyville.

11:50.243 --> 11:51.211
Heh heh heh.

Applejack: I think you
three should be real proud.

12:56.376 --> 12:59.146
Y'all did a mighty impressive
job for your first go-round.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.949
You took the words right
out of my mouth, Applejack.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.984
Isn't that right,
Rainbow Dash?

13:07.520 --> 13:10.290
Any minute now.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.960
Uh...any minute now, what?

13:12.993 --> 13:15.395
Huh? Oh. Uh, nothing.

13:15.428 --> 13:17.998
Have you guys noticed
how quiet it's gotten?

13:18.031 --> 13:20.100
I mean, it's still
early, right?

13:20.133 --> 13:21.534
Of course it's quiet.

13:21.568 --> 13:23.103
Ponies can't talk
while they're eating

13:23.136 --> 13:25.038
those fabulous cookies!

13:25.072 --> 13:26.039
You think?!

13:26.073 --> 13:27.340
Of course.

13:27.374 --> 13:30.944
They're probably all in
a cookie coma right now.

13:30.978 --> 13:33.847
Huh. Maybe you're
right. I'll go check.

13:42.189 --> 13:44.091
What is going on?

13:48.295 --> 13:51.264
OK, definite
cookie-eating happening.

13:51.298 --> 13:53.500
But where is everypony?

13:53.533 --> 13:56.937
They must have seen their
rainbow mouths by now.

13:56.970 --> 13:59.439
They should all be running
out into the streets.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.942
Unless everypony
went to bed early.

14:05.979 --> 14:06.880
Pinkie?

14:06.914 --> 14:09.917
* [mysterious]

14:15.122 --> 14:16.556
The whole town
got the cookies

14:16.589 --> 14:19.226
and now everypony is
shut up in their houses!

14:19.259 --> 14:20.928
You don't think there's
something wrong

14:20.961 --> 14:23.263
with the joke
cookies, do you?

14:30.370 --> 14:33.406
Mrs. Cake! Whew.
Have you seen Pinkie?

14:33.440 --> 14:35.375
I was thinking I might
have something to do

14:35.408 --> 14:36.509
with her not feeling great.

14:40.347 --> 14:43.450
Uh, Mrs. Cake?

14:43.483 --> 14:46.553
[munching]

14:46.586 --> 14:50.590
Cooookies! Cooooookies!

14:50.623 --> 14:53.093
Uhhhhh...I can see you're
busy. I'll come back.

14:54.694 --> 14:55.895

COOOOKIEEEES!

15:01.368 --> 15:03.436

More coookies.

15:45.212 --> 15:48.348
Twilight! You've gotta come
with me to Sugarcube Corner.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.617
Something's going
on with the Cakes.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.619
Well, not something, exactly.

15:52.652 --> 15:55.455
I mean, it may have something
to do with these joke cookies.

15:57.690 --> 16:00.527
COOOKIEEEEES...

16:00.560 --> 16:02.095
Oh no.

16:02.129 --> 16:04.364

You sure you don't mind
us all coming over?

16:36.163 --> 16:37.764
Oh, of course not.

16:37.797 --> 16:39.666
I think the girls have
earned a little celebration

16:39.699 --> 16:41.234
for all of their hard work.

16:41.268 --> 16:44.704
And I have plenty of sewing
machine cake left over.

16:44.737 --> 16:47.174
Unless, anypony
wants a cookie.

16:47.207 --> 16:48.775
Don't touch those!

16:48.808 --> 16:51.544
Oh! There is certainly
no call for that.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.646
There is plenty
for everypony.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.682
Come on! We've got
to get out of here.

16:55.715 --> 16:58.251
What in tarnation are
you going on about?

16:58.285 --> 17:00.487
There's no time! You
have to follow me!

17:00.520 --> 17:03.556
Oh, Rainbow Dash, if you
want all those cookies,

17:03.590 --> 17:06.659
you will have to buy them,
just like everypony else.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.128
I don't want the cookies-

17:08.161 --> 17:12.299
[zombie noises]

17:12.332 --> 17:14.267
--but they do.

17:14.301 --> 17:16.203
Whhh-what's happening?

17:16.236 --> 17:18.305
I'll explain later! Come on!

17:18.338 --> 17:20.340
COOOOOOOKIEEEEEEESSSSS!

17:22.109 --> 17:24.244
We need to find
somewhere to hide!

17:24.277 --> 17:26.646
[zombie noises]

17:26.679 --> 17:28.481
Cooooookies.

17:29.482 --> 17:30.383
This way!

17:30.417 --> 17:33.286
[zombie noises]

17:36.889 --> 17:38.558
[hammering]

17:42.129 --> 17:44.197
Did we lose them?

17:46.166 --> 17:49.302
Why are we running from
the ponies of Ponyville?

17:49.336 --> 17:53.106
What happened to
all of our friends?

17:53.140 --> 17:55.475
I think it's something
in the cookies.

17:55.508 --> 17:57.877
Uh, that's ridiculous.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.647
Filly Guide Cookies
haven't changed for years.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.782
It's not like there's a new
ingredient that's turning

18:02.815 --> 18:05.218
the whole town into
cookie-craving zombies.

18:07.254 --> 18:09.589
Unless there is.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.358
What are you saying?

18:11.391 --> 18:13.860
What did you do?

18:13.893 --> 18:20.767
COOKIEEEES.....

18:20.800 --> 18:22.502
Cover the windows!

18:22.535 --> 18:24.637
COOOOOOKIIEEEEEEEES!

18:24.671 --> 18:27.674
* [dramatic]

18:35.248 --> 18:38.318
OK. So, I may have switched
all the Filly Guide Cookies

18:38.351 --> 18:40.253
for joke cookies that
were supposed to make

18:40.287 --> 18:42.622
ponies' mouths rainbow, but
somehow turned everypony

18:42.655 --> 18:45.358
into mindless cookie-eating
zombies instead.

18:45.392 --> 18:48.195
I figure we just hide out here
until the effects wear off

18:48.228 --> 18:50.630
and as long as nopony
else eats the cookies,

18:50.663 --> 18:52.332
we'll be fine

18:52.365 --> 18:55.702
That's lovely, darling,
except for one thing...

18:55.735 --> 18:59.506
We've already eaten them.

18:59.539 --> 19:02.375
[zombie noises]

19:02.409 --> 19:06.413
Looks like your prank
up and backfired.

19:06.446 --> 19:07.614
[scream]

19:09.549 --> 19:14.754
COOOOKIEEEES!

19:14.787 --> 19:15.888
[gasp]

19:15.922 --> 19:20.660
Cooooookies...

19:20.693 --> 19:22.362
More... Cookies...

19:22.395 --> 19:24.564
No. Stay away. They're
making you sick!

19:24.597 --> 19:26.433
You don't want these.

19:26.466 --> 19:32.372
But we dooo. We want COOKIES.

19:32.405 --> 19:36.309
Please. Stop! I never
meant for this to happen.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.278
It was just a harmless prank.

19:38.311 --> 19:42.782
It was supposed to be funny.
But this isn't funny at all!

19:42.815 --> 19:44.584
Pinkie (normal voice)
Exactly!

19:49.021 --> 19:50.457
What?

19:50.490 --> 19:52.792
Wait. What's happening?

19:52.825 --> 19:55.328
Just delighting in
pranking the prankster.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.829
He-heh, yeah.

19:56.863 --> 20:00.233
How does it feel to get
some of your own medicine?

20:00.267 --> 20:04.003
So, you're not sick?
None of you are?

20:04.036 --> 20:06.439
Of course not, silly.

20:06.473 --> 20:07.707
Everyone: GOTCHA!

20:09.842 --> 20:13.346
This... was all... a PRANK?

20:13.380 --> 20:16.015
Yep. And you can
thank Pinkie Pie.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.851
After you told her about your
plan to prank the whole town,

20:18.885 --> 20:21.488
she got everypony together
and came up with a way

20:21.521 --> 20:23.723
to turn the tables on you.

20:23.756 --> 20:26.593
Aw, shucks. It was nothing.

20:26.626 --> 20:28.795
Just a little something
I threw together.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.530
Uh...

20:30.563 --> 20:32.999
Wow. You should
see your face.

20:33.032 --> 20:35.902
Ha ha! Talk about funny!

20:35.935 --> 20:38.938
Well, I don't think
it's very funny!

20:38.971 --> 20:42.942
And I'm the one that got
pranked. I was really scared.

20:42.975 --> 20:44.977
I thought I made everypony sick.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.513
You can't just go around...

20:46.546 --> 20:48.748
Pranking whoever
you feel like?

20:48.781 --> 20:51.318
Without thinking about how
it might make them feel?

20:51.351 --> 20:52.885
Or if they'd even enjoy it?

20:52.919 --> 20:54.754
Or think it's funny?

20:54.787 --> 20:59.926
Yeah! Oh. I see
what you did there.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.928
Pranks can be a lot
of fun when everypony

21:01.961 --> 21:04.731
has a good time. I thought
you just needed to see

21:04.764 --> 21:06.933
what it's like
when they don't.

21:06.966 --> 21:10.637
I guess I did. I'm
sorry, everypony.

21:10.670 --> 21:13.673
I haven't really been thinking
about how other ponies feel.

21:13.706 --> 21:16.543
Well, I hope you
learned your lesson.

21:16.576 --> 21:19.612
Totally! You ponies pulled
off an amazing prank.

21:19.646 --> 21:21.881
I'll have to work
extra hard to top it.

21:21.914 --> 21:24.651
[crickets]

21:24.684 --> 21:25.885
Gotcha!

21:25.918 --> 21:29.922
