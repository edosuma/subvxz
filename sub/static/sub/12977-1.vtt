02:47.634 --> 02:49.468
              Aww.

03:29.842 --> 03:31.977
          It's Mathieu.

03:32.078 --> 03:34.279
    Perfect charm as always.

03:34.380 --> 03:37.249
  And it's already achieved
    the desired results.

03:40.186 --> 03:41.453
           Now listen.

03:41.554 --> 03:43.956
   We're both going to have
    to lay low for a while.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.491
  The police are really out
   for blood on this one.

03:46.593 --> 03:49.461
       That's no surprise.

03:49.562 --> 03:53.131
   I suggest you disappear
     for the time being.

03:53.233 --> 03:57.402
 I'm going off the radar myself.

03:57.503 --> 04:00.806
You won't be able to reach me,
         so don't try.

04:00.907 --> 04:03.175
  I'll reach out to you when
another assignment comes along

04:03.276 --> 04:07.246
      that requires your
        special skills.

04:07.347 --> 04:10.115
      What are you now,
      eight for eight?

04:10.216 --> 04:11.950
      You deserve a break.

05:11.244 --> 05:14.146
       Breakfast is ready!

05:14.247 --> 05:16.081
         <i>Be right there!</i>

05:19.786 --> 05:21.720
  Sweetie, what are you doing?

05:21.821 --> 05:23.155
    Looking for a blanket
         for Cheryl.

05:23.256 --> 05:24.356
           She's cold.

05:24.457 --> 05:25.490
      Well, your food is
         getting cold.

05:25.591 --> 05:26.792
            Come on.

05:30.129 --> 05:31.229
              Brrr!

05:31.331 --> 05:33.265
               Ah!

05:33.366 --> 05:34.766
      I caught a real doll.

05:34.867 --> 05:36.335
 I didn't mean to scare you,
          sweetie.

05:36.436 --> 05:37.836
  But you've got to stay out
       of my closet, ok?

05:37.937 --> 05:39.237
            Alright.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.579
       What's on the menu?

05:47.680 --> 05:49.715
       Pancakes and toast.

05:49.816 --> 05:50.749
           No can do.

05:50.850 --> 05:51.883
         Diet, remember?

05:51.984 --> 05:54.619
    What, are you training
       for the Olympics?

05:54.721 --> 05:55.887
       You look fantastic.

05:55.988 --> 05:58.557
     Yeah, that's because
         of the diet.

05:58.658 --> 06:01.393
    I'll just have a piece
           of apple.

06:01.494 --> 06:02.894
    It's going to be amazing.

06:02.995 --> 06:04.596
What do you say to your mother
  first thing in the morning?

06:04.697 --> 06:07.466
        I don't know,
       she's not here.

06:07.567 --> 06:09.034
   Teri, we talked about this.

06:09.135 --> 06:11.370
              Kurt.

06:11.471 --> 06:12.904
   It's only been six months.

06:13.005 --> 06:13.739
     These things take time.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.040
         Don't rush it.

06:17.577 --> 06:18.777
   What do you say to Sarah
        in the morning?

06:18.878 --> 06:20.112
      Good morning, Sarah.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.047
  How's my favourite chipmunk?

06:22.148 --> 06:24.549
   Ok, but Betty and Cheryl
         are starving.

06:24.650 --> 06:26.385
       Oh, that's not ok.

06:26.486 --> 06:28.620
      Here, you know what?

06:28.721 --> 06:29.454
         Feed them this.

06:29.555 --> 06:30.956
             Thanks.

06:31.057 --> 06:31.757
         You know what?

06:31.858 --> 06:33.191
    You're better than mommy.

06:38.731 --> 06:39.965
          Eskimo kiss?

06:43.002 --> 06:44.035
     Can I get one of those?

06:44.137 --> 06:49.474
No. I've got something better
          for you.

06:49.575 --> 06:50.842
  Ok, early morning meeting,
        I've gotta go.

06:50.943 --> 06:51.977
            Not fair.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.011
      Someone's gotta work.

06:53.112 --> 06:53.945
          Hey, I work.

06:54.046 --> 06:55.580
       I'm just lacking
        the paycheque.

06:55.681 --> 06:57.315
    That will come as soon
    as you sell the novel.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.417
      Bye, little woman,
       see you tonight.

06:58.518 --> 06:59.284
              Bye.

06:59.385 --> 07:00.652
Bye, get some good writing done.

07:00.753 --> 07:01.653
            Love you!

07:01.754 --> 07:02.654
         Love you more!

07:02.755 --> 07:04.489
          <i>Not possible!</i>

07:28.114 --> 07:34.019
         There has been
 a significant drop in business.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.354
  Many of our clientele have
   been pulling back funding

07:36.456 --> 07:40.058
     for the advertising
     of their products.

07:40.159 --> 07:43.929
   And yet, our competitors,
  like Dickson and Barryman,

07:44.030 --> 07:47.065
    are seeing profits spike.

07:47.166 --> 07:48.967
  Can any of you explain that?

07:52.538 --> 07:54.773
     <i>It comes down to trust.</i>

07:54.874 --> 07:58.543
   We are losing our client's
 trust and we must win that back

07:58.644 --> 08:01.646
   if we hope to stay afloat.

08:01.747 --> 08:04.749
   We have to be better and
   practise what we preach.

08:04.851 --> 08:07.452
  Yes. Absolutely, Mr. Solomon.

08:07.553 --> 08:11.389
   <i>And this goes for everyone</i>
  <i>at this advertising agency.</i>

08:11.491 --> 08:13.225
       I need role models.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.427
           Go-getters.

08:15.528 --> 08:18.763
     If you want to hold
       onto your jobs,

08:18.865 --> 08:22.300
 you have to deliver the goods.

08:22.401 --> 08:25.504
         Is that clear?

08:25.605 --> 08:26.238
              Yes.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.706
: Uh, yes. Clear.

08:27.807 --> 08:32.677
           Good, good.

08:32.778 --> 08:33.678
           That's it.

08:33.779 --> 08:35.113
    Time to start looking
       for a new job.

08:35.214 --> 08:35.981
       You worry too much.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.115
     You don't worry enough.

08:37.216 --> 08:38.582
       You're supporting
     a husband and a kid.

08:38.683 --> 08:40.352
 How are you going to do that
  on an unemployment cheque?

08:40.453 --> 08:41.620
   Failure is not an option
           of mine.

08:41.721 --> 08:42.787
    It might be one of yours.

08:42.889 --> 08:44.322
   That's right, everything
       always works out

08:44.423 --> 08:46.024
  for the great Sarah Goodall.

08:46.125 --> 08:47.592
         I mean Miller.

08:47.693 --> 08:48.827
 You know, I still can't believe
   that you got that promotion

08:48.928 --> 08:50.629
      in less than a year.

08:50.730 --> 08:51.830
        Are you jealous?

08:51.931 --> 08:54.466
 No. I don't know the definition
          of that word.

08:54.567 --> 08:56.067
<i>Later Jackson, I got work to do!</i>

08:59.438 --> 09:01.606
   Good morning, Mrs. Miller.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.174
       Is something wrong?

09:03.276 --> 09:04.676
             Uh, no.

09:04.777 --> 09:07.846
 I just thought I saw myself
 sitting there for a minute.

09:10.283 --> 09:11.850
   Oh. Just trying to take
        your advice.

09:11.951 --> 09:13.285
 You know, present the public
      with the role model

09:13.386 --> 09:14.853
         I most admire.

09:14.954 --> 09:16.855
       And you choose me?

09:16.956 --> 09:18.056
     I hope you don't mind.

09:18.157 --> 09:19.391
         No, not at all.

09:19.492 --> 09:22.294
 I've always wanted a mirror
    of my brunette self.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.862
          I look good.

09:23.963 --> 09:25.530
           Thank you.

09:25.631 --> 09:27.899
  I put a few items on your
      desk for review,

09:28.000 --> 09:29.367
     emailed over all of
       your messages,

09:29.468 --> 09:31.903
    and then I just finished
 reorganizing that file cabinet.

09:32.004 --> 09:33.071
   And how's the construction

09:33.172 --> 09:35.640
  on my penthouse apartment
        coming along?

09:35.741 --> 09:36.875
         Um, I'm sorry.

09:36.976 --> 09:38.143
          Construction?

09:39.445 --> 09:40.545
        That was a joke.

09:40.646 --> 09:41.646
   Seriously, you're amazing.

09:41.747 --> 09:42.647
        Thank you, Julie.

09:42.748 --> 09:43.648
      Now get back to work.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.216
           Right away.

09:45.318 --> 09:46.351
         Oh, I mean me.

09:46.452 --> 09:48.620
   The Stoker account awaits.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.045
   <i>I wonder who that could be?</i>

10:47.146 --> 10:48.880
          <i>Mrs. Punctual?</i>

10:48.981 --> 10:51.916
I wonder who forgot to bring the
mail in again, Mr. Forgetful.

10:52.018 --> 10:53.652
   Well, when your hands are
  full of dolls and crayons,

10:53.753 --> 10:55.387
    choices have to be made.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.888
           I'm sorry.

10:57.923 --> 10:58.990
            Alright.

10:59.091 --> 11:01.559
      Oh... Teri, honey,
     what have I told you

11:01.661 --> 11:02.927
   about hiding in my closet?

11:03.029 --> 11:03.795
              Shh.

11:03.896 --> 11:05.330
 Betty and Cheryl are sleeping.

11:05.431 --> 11:07.132
 Ok, then why don't you take
      Betty and Cheryl

11:07.233 --> 11:08.500
        up to your room?

11:08.601 --> 11:10.769
    I think they'll be more
   comfortable in your bed.

11:10.870 --> 11:12.270
           You think?

11:12.371 --> 11:14.305
             I know.

11:14.407 --> 11:15.907
               Ok.

11:25.418 --> 11:26.818
  Kurt, you gotta talk to her.

11:26.919 --> 11:28.987
I don't want to keep telling
her to stay out of my closet.

11:29.088 --> 11:29.954
     These are my things,
           you know?

11:30.056 --> 11:31.489
   It's a bit of a pet peeve.

11:31.590 --> 11:33.291
            I get it.

11:33.392 --> 11:34.559
           Thank you.

11:34.660 --> 11:36.094
               Hi.

11:39.598 --> 11:40.365
          How are you?

11:40.466 --> 11:41.866
              Good.

11:41.967 --> 11:43.935
  So how's novel writing going?

11:44.036 --> 11:45.970
      It was going fine
      until she called.

11:46.072 --> 11:47.305
               Oh.

11:47.406 --> 11:48.640
 Teri's mother, the nut case
    with a dash of crazy.

11:48.741 --> 11:50.141
         Victoria again?

11:50.242 --> 11:52.777
    Does she not realize that
 divorce means "move on, honey"?

11:52.878 --> 11:54.479
     Not until she's dead
          and buried.

11:54.580 --> 11:56.181
      That can be arranged.

11:56.282 --> 11:58.983
      I mean, I know a guy.

11:59.051 --> 12:01.186
        That's tempting.

12:01.287 --> 12:03.154
    So she's still trying
        for custody?

12:03.255 --> 12:04.022
              Yeah.

12:04.123 --> 12:05.223
  She was in a mental facility.

12:05.324 --> 12:06.291
     The woman is unstable.

12:06.392 --> 12:07.492
   The court can't grant her-

12:07.593 --> 12:09.060
       She's out now and
   she's doing much better,

12:09.161 --> 12:10.695
          so she says,

12:10.796 --> 12:14.499
  and after her father died
   he left her everything.

12:14.600 --> 12:15.734
 So now Victoria is claiming
      that she could be

12:15.835 --> 12:16.634
   a better childcare provider

12:16.736 --> 12:17.902
because of her new found wealth.

12:18.003 --> 12:20.205
   It takes more than money
       to raise a child.

12:20.306 --> 12:21.206
  She needs love and nurturing.

12:21.307 --> 12:24.509
  Victoria doesn't have a case.

12:24.610 --> 12:25.877
              Yeah.

12:53.873 --> 12:55.206
              Kurt?

12:55.307 --> 12:56.441
       What is it, honey?

12:56.542 --> 13:00.612
   I'm on a roll here and
   I'd like to keep going.

13:00.713 --> 13:01.579
           Is that ok?

13:01.680 --> 13:02.247
              Yeah.

13:02.348 --> 13:03.047
           Yeah, yeah.

13:03.149 --> 13:03.915
            Go ahead.

13:04.016 --> 13:05.416
             Thanks.

13:05.518 --> 13:06.017
 I just don't want to lose my
  train of thought, you know?

13:06.118 --> 13:07.685
       No, no, of course.

13:28.974 --> 13:31.609
              Kurt?

13:31.710 --> 13:33.545
           What is it?

13:33.646 --> 13:35.613
       There's a problem.

13:36.682 --> 13:39.551
There was no note, no address
or anything on the envelope,

13:39.652 --> 13:40.885
       we have no idea
         who sent it

13:40.986 --> 13:43.588
 so we thought it was best we
      contact the police.

13:43.689 --> 13:45.223
    You thought it was best.

13:45.324 --> 13:46.558
            Ok, yes.

13:46.659 --> 13:50.094
    I thought it was best
 that we contact the police.

13:50.196 --> 13:54.465
   And you say the photos
  on your cell disappeared?

13:54.567 --> 13:57.602
  Well, my wife accidentally
 deletes things all the time.

13:57.703 --> 14:00.271
 I didn't accidentally delete
           anything.

14:00.372 --> 14:02.507
They were sent to me from that
   new program, Flash Chat.

14:02.608 --> 14:04.142
       They're sent to you

14:04.243 --> 14:07.078
   and within seconds they
   disappear, untraceable.

14:07.179 --> 14:09.914
   And all the pictures were
  of you outside the office,

14:10.015 --> 14:11.182
     outside of this house?

14:11.283 --> 14:12.784
              Yeah.

14:12.885 --> 14:15.453
  Well, unfortunately there
   is no law in this state

14:15.554 --> 14:17.922
   against taking pictures
     in a public place.

14:18.023 --> 14:21.793
  They were all of my wife,
          officer.

14:21.894 --> 14:23.361
      Which I understand
        is disturbing,

14:23.462 --> 14:27.765
      but it's not illegal.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.368
Have you received any letters
         or threats?

14:30.469 --> 14:32.370
               No.

14:32.471 --> 14:34.505
          Love letters?

14:34.607 --> 14:36.608
 What the hell are you implying,
            officer?

14:36.709 --> 14:38.877
     My wife has not done
        anything wrong.

14:38.978 --> 14:41.713
     My mistake, I misspoke.

14:41.814 --> 14:44.115
     But the truth be told,

14:44.216 --> 14:46.885
 this leaves us with very little
          to work with.

14:46.986 --> 14:48.653
     I mean, no crime has
        been committed,

14:48.754 --> 14:52.090
 not even the threat of a crime.

14:52.191 --> 14:55.960
     I'm sorry, but there's
nothing we can do at this point.

15:10.142 --> 15:11.976
         Morning, Sarah.

15:12.077 --> 15:13.044
        How's the family?

15:13.145 --> 15:15.346
  Terry's great, Kurt's great.

15:15.447 --> 15:16.648
        Oh, don't I know.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.182
          He's a catch.

15:18.284 --> 15:20.151
       Hooked a good one.

15:20.252 --> 15:23.488
     Well, give him my best.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.089
             See ya!

15:28.527 --> 15:29.360
               Oh.

15:29.461 --> 15:30.929
       Hey, it's just me.

15:31.030 --> 15:33.665
   It's crossing guard day
    at school, remember?

15:33.766 --> 15:34.399
              Yeah.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.000
    Don't mess with the law.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.735
     I wouldn't dream of it.

15:37.836 --> 15:39.871
       I try to avoid
      getting arrested.

15:39.972 --> 15:41.940
   Why don't you let me give
  you a ride to the station?

15:42.041 --> 15:42.941
        No thanks, babe.

15:43.042 --> 15:44.442
           I want to.

15:44.543 --> 15:47.879
    I want to make sure those
admirers know that you're taken.

15:47.980 --> 15:51.349
  Ah, speaking of admirers,
   you just missed Louise.

15:51.450 --> 15:52.951
     She gives you her best.

15:53.052 --> 15:56.254
 Well, she wants to give you
          her best.

15:56.355 --> 15:57.956
       Louise and I are
       just neighbours.

15:58.057 --> 16:00.291
 Yeah, well I think she moves
          in circles.

16:00.392 --> 16:01.426
       You said she was
        divorced twice,

16:01.527 --> 16:03.594
     I think she's coming
         back around.

16:05.464 --> 16:06.364
         Teri, come on.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.266
      We're taking Sarah
        to the station.

16:49.108 --> 16:51.676
       You're almost late.

16:51.777 --> 16:53.845
Almost late is the same thing
    as saying "on time".

16:53.946 --> 16:55.079
 I showed up a half hour early.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.448
  I'm not taking any chances
          this week.

16:57.549 --> 16:58.616
   Jackson, I was wondering...

16:58.717 --> 17:01.686
    did you have anything
      to do with this?

17:01.787 --> 17:03.421
     No, I only shoot nudes.

17:03.522 --> 17:04.521
       I'm being serious.

17:04.623 --> 17:05.656
            So am I.

17:05.758 --> 17:06.457
    You want to set up for
       a shoot sometime?

17:06.558 --> 17:07.625
   That's never gonna happen.

17:07.726 --> 17:08.992
  Can't blame a guy for trying.

17:09.094 --> 17:10.862
           Yes, I can.

17:14.299 --> 17:15.299
         Morning, Julie.

17:15.401 --> 17:16.166
      Oh good, you're here.

17:16.268 --> 17:19.270
 I've been trying to reach you.

17:19.371 --> 17:23.007
   God, that is a great dress.

17:23.108 --> 17:24.642
             Thanks.

17:24.742 --> 17:26.144
   Yeah, I got a new cell,
      new number, so...

17:26.244 --> 17:27.545
      Oh, what happened
      to your old one?

17:27.646 --> 17:29.313
  I just thought it was time
   for an upgrade, you know?

17:29.415 --> 17:30.948
  Actually, can you put my
 business contacts in there?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.650
   I think you have more of
  a complete list than I do.

17:32.751 --> 17:33.351
           Sure, yeah.

17:33.452 --> 17:34.385
     Easier done than said.

17:34.486 --> 17:35.953
  Is your new number listed
          in here?

17:36.055 --> 17:36.888
       Yeah, it should be.

17:36.989 --> 17:37.889
               Ok.

17:37.990 --> 17:39.290
     Oh, and Mr. Solomon
         stopped by.

17:39.391 --> 17:42.527
   He wants to talk to you
  about the Stoker account.

17:42.628 --> 17:44.495
    Tell him I will be in
        in a minute.

17:44.596 --> 17:46.030
               Ok.

18:18.964 --> 18:20.364
             Sarah.

18:20.466 --> 18:21.165
  Oh, Mr. Solomon, I was just
 heading over to your office.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.234
    Well, I saved you a trip.

18:24.470 --> 18:26.003
     Your phone is all done.

18:35.948 --> 18:39.517
I don't have to tell you, Sarah,
    but I'm going to anyway.

18:39.618 --> 18:42.353
      A lot is riding on
        this campaign.

18:42.454 --> 18:44.522
     Stoker is a big account

18:44.623 --> 18:50.361
and possibly all our jobs are
on the line, including mine.

18:50.462 --> 18:53.231
  And if the boss is worried
     about losing his job,

18:53.332 --> 18:54.932
  you know things are serious.

18:55.033 --> 18:57.535
   I completely understand,
         Mr. Solomon.

18:57.636 --> 19:01.305
  There's no need to worry, I
have everything under control.

19:01.406 --> 19:03.541
 You know there's a $200,000
         cash bonus

19:03.642 --> 19:06.144
       for whoever pulls
      off this campaign?

19:09.715 --> 19:13.551
      I did not know that.

19:13.652 --> 19:16.387
Is that what you were discussing
    with Jackson in the hall?

19:18.590 --> 19:21.659
         That's strange.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.427
     Your phone doesn't
   usually ring like that?

19:23.529 --> 19:26.030
    It's not that, I just
       got this cell.

19:26.131 --> 19:27.698
     No one has the number.

19:32.237 --> 19:34.071
      Something important?

19:34.173 --> 19:36.774
        No, it's nothing.

19:36.875 --> 19:41.512
  So, you know how important
   the stoker account is now

19:41.613 --> 19:45.183
 and we need to pull this off
     with flying colours.

19:45.284 --> 19:46.450
           Understood.

19:46.552 --> 19:48.653
   No distractions, giving
     your full attention

19:48.754 --> 19:50.821
      to every last detail.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.924
    And if this one works...

19:53.025 --> 19:55.193
             Sarah?

19:55.294 --> 19:56.928
    Are you listening to me?

19:57.029 --> 19:58.329
            Yes. Yes.

19:58.430 --> 20:00.598
    Rest assured the Stoker
account has my full attention.

20:00.699 --> 20:01.465
           Absolutely.

20:01.567 --> 20:03.100
  Is the sun here in your eyes?

20:03.202 --> 20:04.936
 I just feel like it's a bit
        distracting.

20:05.037 --> 20:08.839
       I'm fine, Sarah.
          Are you ok?

20:12.644 --> 20:13.644
         Yes, I'm fine.

20:13.745 --> 20:15.346
          Never better.

20:19.084 --> 20:21.118
   I'll leave you to it then.

20:21.220 --> 20:25.089
   Just give me greatness,
    that's all I ask for.

20:25.190 --> 20:26.724
            Will do.

20:36.368 --> 20:37.568
  Julie, did you just call me?

20:37.669 --> 20:38.603
               No.

20:38.704 --> 20:39.637
    Did you give my number
          to anyone?

20:39.738 --> 20:40.238
              Yes.

20:40.339 --> 20:41.672
              What?

20:41.773 --> 20:43.241
  Well, your husband called
 just as Mr. Solomon came in

20:43.342 --> 20:45.076
 and I didn't want to disrupt
         your meeting.

20:45.177 --> 20:46.510
  And then he mentioned that
     he couldn't reach you

20:46.612 --> 20:48.346
on your cell and I realized he
  didn't have the new number

20:48.447 --> 20:49.513
      so I gave it to him.

20:49.615 --> 20:50.781
        I hope that's ok.

20:50.882 --> 20:51.682
      Yeah, no that's fine.

20:51.783 --> 20:52.617
        Just nobody else.

20:52.718 --> 20:55.253
               Ok.

20:55.354 --> 20:57.655
          What is that?

20:57.756 --> 20:59.357
        Uh, my lipstick?

21:01.026 --> 21:02.593
 Is that Red Passion by Louelle?

21:02.694 --> 21:04.428
             It is.

21:04.529 --> 21:05.696
         Do you like it?

21:05.797 --> 21:10.268
    Yeah, no I use it on
  my date nights with Kurt.

21:10.369 --> 21:12.603
      Lucky guess, I guess.

21:12.704 --> 21:14.639
         So do you um...

21:14.740 --> 21:16.307
   do you talk to Kurt a lot?

21:16.408 --> 21:18.576
       No, not that often.

21:18.677 --> 21:23.514
  But every time that I do,
       he is so nice.

21:23.615 --> 21:26.050
        You're so lucky.

21:26.151 --> 21:30.488
      Yes, he's very nice.

21:30.589 --> 21:32.723
      What are you doing
          for lunch?

21:35.961 --> 21:37.995
  I've been working for you
  for over five months now

21:38.096 --> 21:41.999
 and this is the first time that
   you've asked me for lunch.

21:42.100 --> 21:43.301
  I've heard the rumors like
         everyone else

21:43.402 --> 21:44.969
 about possible layoffs coming-

21:45.070 --> 21:48.005
       No, no, no. It's
      nothing like that.

21:48.106 --> 21:49.540
     It's nothing like that.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.976
   I just wanted to see what's
 going on from your perspective,

21:52.077 --> 21:53.544
            you know?

21:53.645 --> 21:55.880
  I mean, between you and me
   you're the eyes and ears

21:55.981 --> 21:57.882
      of the office, so...

21:57.983 --> 21:59.250
     Thank you, Mrs. Miller.

21:59.351 --> 22:01.652
 I didn't know you considered
          me your...

22:01.753 --> 22:04.021
      I didn't know you
       considered me.

22:04.122 --> 22:07.024
   Come on, Julie, you have
        all my numbers,

22:07.125 --> 22:10.194
    you pick up my morning
     mail and my messages.

22:10.295 --> 22:14.298
   I mean, what would I do
    without you, really?

22:14.399 --> 22:20.271
 Actually, have you received any
 unusual phone calls or emails,

22:20.372 --> 22:22.239
 anything I should be aware of?

22:22.341 --> 22:23.407
               No.

22:23.508 --> 22:25.343
  No, not that I can think of.

22:33.418 --> 22:35.419
    Do you know what this is?

22:39.024 --> 22:40.925
   It looks like you coming
          into work.

22:41.026 --> 22:41.926
         Who took this?

22:42.027 --> 22:45.096
  That's what I was wondering.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.598
    Is someone watching you?

22:47.699 --> 22:50.401
     Like a secret admirer?

22:50.502 --> 22:52.103
     You have the secret
        part correct,

22:52.204 --> 22:56.474
      I don't know about
       the admirer part.

22:56.575 --> 22:59.043
   Have you talked to Jackson?

22:59.144 --> 23:00.945
     Why would you ask that?

23:01.046 --> 23:04.248
 Well, I know he's interested
            in you.

23:04.349 --> 23:05.649
              What?

23:05.751 --> 23:08.953
 He comes by my desk and asks
    about you all the time.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.454
      What do you tell him?

23:10.555 --> 23:13.090
 That you are happily married
and that you love your husband

23:13.191 --> 23:15.893
        very, very much.

23:15.994 --> 23:18.295
    Honestly, Mrs. Miller,
    I wish I was so lucky.

23:18.397 --> 23:23.100
 Oh, don't worry Julie, I'm
sure you will be one day too.

23:23.201 --> 23:25.903
      Well, here's hoping.

23:29.708 --> 23:31.142
    Shoot, it's getting late.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.810
 I have a little errand to run
 before I go back to the office,

23:32.911 --> 23:33.911
           is that ok?

23:34.012 --> 23:35.246
       Yeah, of course.
          What is it?

23:35.347 --> 23:36.580
     I have to go to Block,

23:36.681 --> 23:38.649
 grab a dress for a friend's
    wedding next weekend.

23:38.750 --> 23:39.683
   Why don't I come with you?

23:39.785 --> 23:41.652
      I could use a new
       outfit myself.

23:41.753 --> 23:44.188
             Oh, ok.

23:44.623 --> 23:47.124
             <i>Thanks!</i>

23:47.225 --> 23:48.759
           Take care.

23:57.869 --> 23:58.536
           Hey, kiddo.

23:58.637 --> 23:59.770
     Where do you wanna go?

23:59.871 --> 24:00.704
              Home.

24:00.806 --> 24:02.039
       Aren't you hungry?

24:02.140 --> 24:04.341
 Betty and Cheryl will miss me.

24:04.443 --> 24:05.609
     Ok, well we could go
         by the house,

24:05.710 --> 24:06.544
    pick up Betty and Cheryl

24:06.645 --> 24:07.945
and all four of us could go eat?

24:08.046 --> 24:08.679
               Ok.

24:08.780 --> 24:09.947
               Ok.

24:28.733 --> 24:30.067
        Can you help me?

24:34.272 --> 24:38.542
     Oh, I never realized
     we're the same size.

24:38.643 --> 24:41.312
      We could wear each
        others clothes.

24:41.413 --> 24:42.813
        How does it look?

24:42.914 --> 24:45.082
          It's lovely.

24:45.183 --> 24:47.184
 I'm going to have to borrow
 this for a date with Kurt.

24:47.285 --> 24:49.820
   Do you think he'd like it?

24:49.921 --> 24:51.222
          Oh, hold on.

25:00.065 --> 25:01.732
    Is something the matter?

25:55.520 --> 25:56.887
             Sarah.

25:56.988 --> 25:57.888
         You know what?

25:57.989 --> 25:59.657
 I'm going to be right there,
              ok?

26:01.760 --> 26:03.561
           Two hours.

26:03.662 --> 26:05.963
           Long lunch.

26:06.064 --> 26:08.465
 Flirting with the danger zone.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.234
   You know, because I'm just
 worried about getting laid off.

26:10.335 --> 26:11.468
    Solomon's on the warpath.

26:11.570 --> 26:14.738
He's just looking for reasons
       to fire people,

26:14.839 --> 26:18.242
    and I'd just be careful
   with these long lunches.

26:19.744 --> 26:20.477
      What are friends for?

26:20.579 --> 26:22.246
  We've got to stick together.

26:22.347 --> 26:26.083
    Look out for one another.

26:26.184 --> 26:27.918
            Exactly.

26:29.020 --> 26:30.754
        Catch you later.

26:36.595 --> 26:39.930
        Hey, are you ok?

26:40.031 --> 26:42.166
 Are you still freaked by seeing
        that guy get hit?

26:42.267 --> 26:43.867
   Yeah, no, no, I'm fine.
          I'm fine.

26:43.969 --> 26:45.469
 Can you just get my husband
        on the line?

26:45.570 --> 26:47.171
  Put him through to my office.

26:54.746 --> 26:56.213
   <i>Mrs. Miller, your husband</i>
   <i>isn't answering his cell.</i>

26:56.314 --> 26:59.717
     <i>Do you want me to try</i>
       <i>your home number?</i>

26:59.818 --> 27:00.784
        No thanks, Julie.

27:00.885 --> 27:02.453
          I can manage.

27:49.067 --> 27:50.834
          <i>It wasn't him.</i>

28:11.456 --> 28:14.792
<i>The</i>
   <i>Miller's aren't home,</i>
  <i>please leave a message.</i>

28:14.893 --> 28:16.393
       <i>Kurt, hey, it's me.</i>

28:16.494 --> 28:18.962
   <i>Something happened today,</i>
          <i>something...</i>

28:19.064 --> 28:20.030
  <i>I'll tell you about it later.</i>

28:20.131 --> 28:21.865
    <i>I'm coming in on the 5:06.</i>

28:21.966 --> 28:27.771
Since you drove me I'm gonna
need a ride home if that's ok.

28:27.872 --> 28:29.573
           <i>I love you.</i>

28:29.674 --> 28:31.475
             <i>Ok, bye.</i>

28:43.755 --> 28:44.421
          Where's Teri?

28:44.522 --> 28:45.789
         She's at home.

28:45.890 --> 28:47.224
     She was watching her
        favourite show

28:47.325 --> 28:50.394
so I had Louise come watch her
   while I came to get you.

28:50.495 --> 28:51.929
 Oh. That was so nice of Louise.

28:52.030 --> 28:53.397
             It was.

28:53.498 --> 28:54.264
       I got your message.

28:54.365 --> 28:57.267
         What happened?

28:57.368 --> 28:59.470
 I thought I saw the guy who
 was taking pictures of me.

28:59.571 --> 29:00.170
          You saw him?

29:00.271 --> 29:01.839
      No, I didn't see him.

29:01.940 --> 29:03.540
         It wasn't him.

29:03.641 --> 29:06.477
 I still don't know who's behind
 this or what he or she wants.

29:29.701 --> 29:30.534
   Did you remember the mail?

29:30.635 --> 29:31.668
        Yes. Just bills.

29:31.770 --> 29:34.071
   No more manilla envelopes.

29:37.976 --> 29:40.177
  Oh, welcome home love birds.

29:40.278 --> 29:41.011
           Hi, Louise.

29:41.112 --> 29:41.812
   Thank you for watching her.

29:41.913 --> 29:42.713
           No problem.

29:42.814 --> 29:44.782
        Teri is an angel.

29:44.883 --> 29:48.285
 If I ever have kids I'd want
  them to be just like yours.

29:51.456 --> 29:53.123
    Would you like to stay
          for dinner?

29:53.224 --> 29:56.360
   No thank you, maybe some
          other time.

29:56.461 --> 29:58.061
  I did check on the roast,
           though.

29:58.163 --> 30:02.032
      It smells wonderful.

30:02.133 --> 30:03.834
         Well, I'm off.

30:03.935 --> 30:06.804
          Thanks again.

30:06.905 --> 30:08.105
              Bye.

30:11.576 --> 30:12.576
  I know what you're thinking.

30:12.677 --> 30:14.178
          Don't say it.

30:14.279 --> 30:15.979
      Then don't think it.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.981
      My thoughts are pure.

30:18.082 --> 30:19.516
       I can change that.

30:19.617 --> 30:20.884
              Yeah.

30:29.961 --> 30:31.662
   Did you change the photos?

30:31.763 --> 30:33.163
              What?

30:35.266 --> 30:37.868
   The photos, they're not
     in the right order.

30:37.969 --> 30:39.903
     This one was here,
     that one was there.

30:40.004 --> 30:40.771
          Are you sure?

30:40.872 --> 30:41.438
          I'm positive.

30:41.539 --> 30:42.539
       Did Louise do this?

30:42.640 --> 30:45.409
       Why would Louise...

30:45.510 --> 30:47.411
  Someone's been in the house.

30:55.320 --> 30:57.120
 Honey, I think you're being
     a little paranoid.

30:57.222 --> 30:58.121
   I've been home for hours
          with Teri,

30:58.223 --> 30:59.256
   I didn't notice anything
           missing.

30:59.357 --> 31:00.657
   Kurt, someone's been here.

31:00.758 --> 31:02.292
  Who would break into our
  home to rearrange photos?

31:02.393 --> 31:04.061
       Whoever has been
         stalking me!

31:04.162 --> 31:06.230
     I got more photos on
      my new phone today.

31:06.331 --> 31:07.130
        Let me see them.

31:07.232 --> 31:09.766
        They're gone,
       same as before!

31:09.868 --> 31:12.736
     No note, no threat,
      nothing illegal.

31:12.837 --> 31:15.272
  The police can't do anything.

31:15.373 --> 31:16.740
      Well, maybe they can.

31:16.841 --> 31:19.042
    It wouldn't hurt to call.

31:19.143 --> 31:22.579
Daddy, when are we going
         <i>to eat?</i>

31:22.680 --> 31:23.881
           Let's eat.

31:23.982 --> 31:26.083
     We don't want Teri
     worried about this.

31:26.184 --> 31:27.084
               Ok.

31:27.185 --> 31:29.219
     We'll figure it out
        after dinner.

31:31.723 --> 31:34.524
     It'll be ready soon,
           sweetie.

31:56.581 --> 31:58.248
  So I was about to go up to
        the black board

31:58.349 --> 32:02.653
 when the big stupid kid, Elmer,
  who thinks apples are green-

32:02.754 --> 32:05.789
     Some apples are green.

32:05.890 --> 32:07.524
 It's not nice to call people
            stupid.

32:07.625 --> 32:09.526
    He says I have big ears.

32:09.627 --> 32:11.194
 Well, that's not nice either
      because you don't.

32:11.296 --> 32:12.829
    You have beautiful ears.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.932
       So Elmer went up
      to the black board

32:15.033 --> 32:19.102
and he didn't know the answer
    'cause he's so smart

32:19.203 --> 32:21.939
so I lifted my hand up to answer

32:22.040 --> 32:24.708
  and then he leans against
        the bookshelf

32:24.809 --> 32:28.645
   and the whole thing breaks.

32:28.746 --> 32:32.482
 So Elmer falls down and all
the books fall on top of him.

32:32.583 --> 32:33.717
     Everyone was laughing.

32:33.818 --> 32:35.152
        It was so funny.

32:35.253 --> 32:36.520
  It doesn't sound very funny.

32:36.621 --> 32:37.821
             It was.

32:38.756 --> 32:40.123
  Teri, stop kicking the table

32:40.224 --> 32:41.658
     and think about this
         for a second.

32:41.759 --> 32:43.060
   If you were the one that
        broke the shelf

32:43.161 --> 32:45.696
and it fell down on you, would
    you think it was funny?

32:45.797 --> 32:47.164
             Maybe.

32:47.265 --> 32:49.533
  My point is you don't want
       to be laughed at,

32:49.634 --> 32:52.536
 so do you think it's fair to
laugh at other people as well?

32:56.741 --> 32:57.908
    Hey. What did I just say?

32:58.009 --> 32:59.576
   It wasn't me, it was Betty.

32:59.677 --> 33:00.811
I'm not going to warn you again.

33:01.913 --> 33:03.313
              <i>Teri.</i>

33:03.414 --> 33:05.215
          <i>It was Cheryl.</i>

33:05.316 --> 33:07.351
     <i>Hey. Ok, that's enough.</i>

33:07.452 --> 33:08.685
     Daddy, Cheryl, stop it.

33:08.786 --> 33:09.720
      Both of you, stop it.

33:09.821 --> 33:11.054
           Right now.

33:24.602 --> 33:25.969
              Um...

33:32.110 --> 33:35.278
     Where did you get this?

33:35.380 --> 33:37.781
    I've had it for a while.

33:37.882 --> 33:41.385
   Before we met I was mugged

33:41.486 --> 33:42.719
and it was the scariest night
         of my life

33:42.820 --> 33:44.955
   and I swore it was never
    going to happen again.

33:45.056 --> 33:48.558
  So I started working out,
 taking self-defense courses

33:48.659 --> 33:51.161
        and I got a gun.

33:51.262 --> 33:53.797
  It's licensed, registered,
     I know how to use it.

33:57.869 --> 34:00.937
  <i>You know I told you before...</i>

34:01.039 --> 34:02.439
    <i>I don't like guns, Sarah.</i>

34:02.540 --> 34:06.276
  <i>I know, that's why I didn't</i>
       <i>tell you about it.</i>

34:06.377 --> 34:07.911
   <i>But I'm a pretty good shot.</i>

34:08.012 --> 34:12.081
   <i>Yeah, I remember because we</i>
  <i>threw darts on our first date.</i>

34:12.183 --> 34:14.384
    <i>Don't you think you're</i>
  <i>overreacting a little bit?</i>

34:22.994 --> 34:24.661
     When did you get this?

34:24.762 --> 34:26.630
   Just before when we were
           up here.

34:26.731 --> 34:28.297
    Ok, we have to report
     this to the police.

34:28.399 --> 34:29.166
        This is a threat.

34:29.266 --> 34:30.734
             Is it?

34:30.835 --> 34:32.735
           Not really.

34:32.837 --> 34:35.472
"It's not the final outcome, but
the waiting that gets to you"?

34:35.572 --> 34:37.440
    That could mean anything.

34:37.542 --> 34:39.476
  You know how that police
  officer treated us today.

34:39.577 --> 34:42.279
  <i>I know, but this person has</i>
       <i>been in our house.</i>

34:42.380 --> 34:42.978
         <i>What about Teri?</i>

34:43.081 --> 34:44.447
       <i>What if she's hurt?</i>

34:44.549 --> 34:45.681
Maybe we should send her
to your parent's house.

34:45.783 --> 34:46.583
           <i>In Chicago?</i>

34:46.684 --> 34:50.487
   <i>this guy destroy our family.</i>

34:50.588 --> 34:53.090
    Maybe we can all take
         a vacation.

34:53.190 --> 34:55.192
  Running away never solves
          anything.

34:55.293 --> 34:57.828
Besides, if I leave now I can
    kiss my job goodbye.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.629
   They're doing cut-backs at
 work and looking for any reason

34:59.730 --> 35:01.998
      to lay people off and
 we can't afford that right now.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.267
    Not with your ex-wife
  breathing down your neck.

35:04.368 --> 35:05.702
  We should change the locks
          to be safe.

35:05.803 --> 35:07.003
  We have to stick together,
             Kurt.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.106
  I'll keep an eye on Julie
    and Jackson at work.

35:09.207 --> 35:10.173
     Your secretary, Julie?

35:10.274 --> 35:11.374
    She worships you, though.

35:11.476 --> 35:13.610
 Yeah, maybe a little too much.

35:13.711 --> 35:15.512
And Jackson would do anything
to keep his job at the firm.

35:15.613 --> 35:18.882
    I mean, if I'm let go,
 he's in a stronger position.

35:18.983 --> 35:22.185
    And we can't forget your
 lover Louise across the street.

35:22.286 --> 35:23.453
   Louise isn't going to be a-

35:23.554 --> 35:25.188
     Kurt, give me a break.

35:25.289 --> 35:28.225
   She's in love with you,
        it's obvious.

35:28.326 --> 35:31.795
She was the one who was here,
       she had access.

35:35.166 --> 35:36.833
       I'm sorry, I really
don't know why this is happening

35:36.934 --> 35:39.703
     but I'm gonna find out.

35:39.804 --> 35:42.806
       <i>No, we'll find out.</i>

35:42.907 --> 35:44.808
            <i>Together.</i>

35:45.977 --> 35:48.044
        <i>I love you, Sarah.</i>

35:48.146 --> 35:49.946
         <i>I love you, too.</i>

35:51.616 --> 35:53.850
   <i>ctures can't hurt us, right?</i>

35:53.951 --> 35:56.620
     <i>Pictures can't hurt us.</i>

36:25.082 --> 36:26.583
        That's yesterday.

36:32.323 --> 36:33.990
         Who are you?!!

36:48.172 --> 36:49.306
       Hey Teri, come on.

36:49.407 --> 36:51.241
        Time for school.

36:51.342 --> 36:53.343
             <i>Coming!</i>

37:00.718 --> 37:02.085
          Hey, George!

37:02.186 --> 37:03.620
           What gives?

37:03.721 --> 37:05.922
   I'm sorry, can I help you?

37:06.023 --> 37:07.824
  I thought you were George,
     our regular mail man.

37:07.925 --> 37:10.126
    Oh, no, I'm filling in
      for him this week.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.094
           I'm Harold.

37:11.195 --> 37:12.329
    What happened to George?

37:12.430 --> 37:14.431
Uh, some sort of family thing
          I heard.

37:14.532 --> 37:15.632
           Emergency.

37:15.733 --> 37:17.133
   I don't know much about it.

37:19.036 --> 37:20.604
   Hey Teri, wait in the car.

37:20.705 --> 37:22.739
      I'll be right there.

37:22.840 --> 37:24.307
            Cute kid.

37:24.408 --> 37:25.809
       Yeah, yeah she is.

37:25.910 --> 37:26.676
              Mr...

37:26.777 --> 37:27.344
             Martin.

37:27.445 --> 37:28.144
         Harold Martin.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.779
     You can call me Harold,

37:29.880 --> 37:32.315
 that's what I'm telling all the
  folks up and down the block.

37:32.416 --> 37:35.252
     You got a real friendly
 neighbourhood here, Mr. Miller.

37:35.353 --> 37:37.654
      It makes me happy
     that I transferred.

37:37.755 --> 37:38.822
          <i>Dad, let's go!</i>

37:38.923 --> 37:40.190
     Oh, listen to me, I'm
    standing here babbling

37:40.291 --> 37:41.691
 and you're in a hurry to get
          some place.

37:41.792 --> 37:43.793
      I'll leave you to it.

37:43.894 --> 37:45.528
         Thanks, Harold.

37:45.630 --> 37:48.131
     Oh, by the way, George

37:48.232 --> 37:50.367
      usually leaves the
  mail in the uh... mailbox.

37:50.468 --> 37:51.534
 Yeah, that was my intention
            too,

37:51.636 --> 37:53.136
but you've got no room in there.

37:53.237 --> 37:54.638
     You've got a package
         or something.

37:54.739 --> 37:56.940
  It was there when I arrived.

37:57.041 --> 37:59.576
It's really nice to meet you,
         Mr. Miller.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.137
   Teri! Put on your seatbelt!

38:27.238 --> 38:28.972
          <i>What's wrong?</i>

38:29.073 --> 38:30.774
   <i>Nothing, just do what</i>
        <i>I told you!</i>

38:36.814 --> 38:38.448
      We're not that late.

38:48.292 --> 38:50.560
   <i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

39:03.541 --> 39:05.342
 I'm just saying that I think
         Sarah's been

39:05.443 --> 39:08.878
    a little out of sorts
     the last few days.

39:10.948 --> 39:11.948
            Morning.

39:12.049 --> 39:13.049
 Julie, do you have any messages
             for me?

39:13.150 --> 39:14.718
      Yes. Your husband
      has been calling.

39:14.819 --> 39:16.353
     He sounds really upset.

39:16.454 --> 39:18.054
   He said that you're not
    answering your cell?

39:18.155 --> 39:19.089
        Yeah, I lost it.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.023
  Can you get me a new one,
           please?

39:20.124 --> 39:21.191
            Ok, yep.

39:21.292 --> 39:22.726
   He wants you to call him
       back right away.

39:22.827 --> 39:24.894
   And Mr. Solomon stopped by,
 he wants to see you and Jackson

39:24.995 --> 39:28.365
at 10:30 this morning to discuss
       the Stoker account.

39:28.466 --> 39:30.867
   I've been recruited too,
        it's mandatory.

39:30.968 --> 39:34.204
    He's expecting results,
it's getting down to the wire.

39:34.305 --> 39:36.973
       So, how's it going?

39:37.074 --> 39:38.641
           It's going.

39:38.743 --> 39:40.110
          And so am I.

39:40.211 --> 39:40.777
           Work to do.

39:40.878 --> 39:43.413
           Talk soon.

39:43.514 --> 39:44.948
           Talk soon.

39:45.049 --> 39:46.883
              Yeah.

39:47.918 --> 39:51.621
Mrs. Miller, you have a call
         <i>on line one.</i>

39:51.722 --> 39:52.956
     Is it my husband again?

39:53.057 --> 39:54.090
      <i>Lieutenant James Stern</i>

39:54.191 --> 39:56.826
     <i>of the 28th division</i>
      <i>police department.</i>

40:06.670 --> 40:08.071
             Hello?

40:08.172 --> 40:09.239
    <i>Good morning, Mrs. Miller.</i>

40:09.340 --> 40:11.174
   <i>My name is Lieutenant</i>
        <i>James Stern.</i>

40:11.275 --> 40:14.911
I was wondering if I may ask
     <i>you some questions.</i>

40:15.012 --> 40:16.479
         Concerning...?

40:16.580 --> 40:20.316
The photographs, text messages,
   <i>notes you've been receiving</i>

40:20.418 --> 40:22.318
        <i>the last few days.</i>

40:22.420 --> 40:25.622
I received a call this morning
        <i>about your case.</i>

40:25.723 --> 40:29.426
 Um, well I really appreciate
   your concern Lieutenant,

40:29.527 --> 40:33.263
but I'm sure it's just someone
    playing a game with me.

40:33.364 --> 40:36.266
  <i>I wouldn't take things like</i>
<i>this so lightly, Mrs. Miller.</i>

40:36.367 --> 40:39.602
      <i>There are a lot of</i>
<i>sick individuals out there.</i>

40:39.703 --> 40:41.471
     Well, we'll be alright.

40:41.572 --> 40:43.206
 You see, I lost my cell phone,

40:43.307 --> 40:44.874
    that's why my husband
     couldn't reach me.

40:44.975 --> 40:46.509
   He really shouldn't have
       bothered you but

40:46.610 --> 40:48.845
 with the kid, you know, he's
   a little overprotective.

40:48.946 --> 40:50.713
   <i>It wasn't your husband</i>
        <i>who called.</i>

40:53.417 --> 40:56.619
        Um... it wasn't?

40:56.720 --> 40:58.855
  Who was it that contacted
       your precinct?

40:58.956 --> 41:00.123
       <i>An anonymous caller.</i>

41:00.224 --> 41:05.662
      <i>A concerned friend</i>
     <i>I believe they said.</i>

41:05.763 --> 41:07.030
     Thank you, Lieutenant.

41:07.131 --> 41:08.164
    <i>Don't worry, Mrs. Miller.</i>

41:08.265 --> 41:09.899
    <i>We'll be keeping an eye</i>
            <i>on you.</i>

41:10.000 --> 41:10.900
           No, no, no.

41:11.001 --> 41:12.335
  That's really not necessary.

41:12.436 --> 41:13.169
      <i>It's part of the job.</i>

41:13.270 --> 41:15.071
            <i>Good bye.</i>

41:45.836 --> 41:46.436
       <i>Sarah Miller's desk-</i>

41:46.537 --> 41:47.237
     Julie, it's Kurt again.

41:47.338 --> 41:48.137
   Where the hell is my wife?

41:48.239 --> 41:50.139
       <i>I really don't know.</i>

41:50.241 --> 41:53.443
     <i>She just ran off but</i>
      <i>I'm sure she's ok.</i>

41:53.544 --> 41:57.146
   <i>Do you want me to go look</i>
            <i>for her?</i>

41:57.248 --> 41:58.681
             Just...

41:58.782 --> 42:00.350
        hold on a second.

42:11.729 --> 42:13.396
       It's mail. Nothing.

42:17.668 --> 42:18.968
    Hello again, Mr. Miller.

42:19.069 --> 42:20.336
       You called this in?

42:20.437 --> 42:21.938
              Yeah.

42:22.039 --> 42:23.172
    I don't know if you're
         aware of this

42:23.274 --> 42:26.142
   but it's a federal crime
    to report a fake bomb.

42:26.243 --> 42:28.011
      What was in the box?

42:28.112 --> 42:29.112
           Your mail.

42:29.213 --> 42:30.480
      No ticking packages.

42:30.581 --> 42:32.849
   It was there this morning.

42:32.950 --> 42:34.984
     Did anyone else see
        the package?

42:35.085 --> 42:36.286
       The mailman saw it,

42:36.387 --> 42:38.254
  that's why he couldn't put
      my mail in the box.

42:38.355 --> 42:40.590
   Look, my wife and I are
     not making this up.

42:40.691 --> 42:42.458
 Louise, did you see anybody
     tampering in there?

42:42.560 --> 42:43.760
 Maybe somebody took it away
        when I left.

42:43.861 --> 42:45.628
  No, it was just the mailman.

42:49.967 --> 42:52.835
      Ok, let's wrap it up!

42:52.937 --> 42:54.103
           Hey, Kurt?

42:54.204 --> 42:55.171
              Kurt?

42:55.272 --> 42:57.106
       <i>Are you still there?</i>

42:57.207 --> 42:58.374
        <i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

42:58.475 --> 42:59.776
          <i>Sorry, Julie.</i>

42:59.877 --> 43:01.010
  <i>Just let me know as soon as</i>
       <i>my wife gets back.</i>

43:01.111 --> 43:01.678
        Yeah, of course.

43:01.779 --> 43:02.979
           I will do.

43:03.080 --> 43:04.380
 And don't worry, everything
      is gonna be fine.

43:04.481 --> 43:07.150
 If you need anything at all
    just let me know, ok?

43:07.251 --> 43:08.351
          <i>Thanks, Julie.</i>

43:08.452 --> 43:09.786
              Bye.

43:10.821 --> 43:12.155
      Who was that, Julie?

43:12.256 --> 43:13.523
    Oh good, Mrs. Miller,
        you're here.

43:13.624 --> 43:14.223
      Who was on the phone?

43:14.325 --> 43:15.325
     That was your husband.

43:15.426 --> 43:18.728
  You need to call him back
         right now.

43:18.829 --> 43:21.531
   You've been getting pretty
friendly with Kurt, haven't you?

43:21.632 --> 43:22.532
         Yeah, I guess.

43:22.633 --> 43:23.499
     I'm just trying to be-

43:23.601 --> 43:24.801
            Helpful.

43:24.902 --> 43:26.636
        Yes, Mrs. Miller.

43:26.737 --> 43:27.704
              Yeah.

43:27.805 --> 43:29.339
   I don't know what I'd do
         without you.

43:29.440 --> 43:30.640
 I mean, you practically know
       what I'm gonna do

43:30.741 --> 43:33.076
      before I even do it.

43:33.177 --> 43:36.045
You have access to my emails,
      my phone numbers,

43:36.146 --> 43:37.547
         my whole life.

43:37.648 --> 43:39.248
    If I've overstepped my
        boundaries, I-

43:39.350 --> 43:40.316
   I'd say calling the police

43:40.417 --> 43:42.352
 is a little bit of an overstep,
             Julie.

43:42.453 --> 43:44.253
  I didn't call the police,
      they called you.

43:44.355 --> 43:47.090
   Yeah, and who told them
         to call me?

43:47.191 --> 43:48.524
    I don't know, probably
         your husband

43:48.626 --> 43:49.993
   because of the bomb scare.

43:50.094 --> 43:51.160
              What?

43:51.261 --> 43:52.328
         At your house.

43:52.429 --> 43:53.329
   What are you talking about?

43:53.430 --> 43:54.564
        Is everybody ok?

43:54.665 --> 43:56.532
    Yes, everyone is fine,
   and from what I gathered

43:56.634 --> 43:58.935
  it was a false alarm, but
     Mr. Miller sounded

43:59.036 --> 44:00.870
    really, really shaken up.

44:00.971 --> 44:02.038
   You need to call him back.

44:02.139 --> 44:02.739
           Yeah, yeah.

44:02.840 --> 44:03.740
      Get Kurt on the line.

44:03.841 --> 44:05.174
               Ok.

44:05.275 --> 44:06.442
 Wait, Julie, get Lieutenant
  Stern on the line first.

44:06.543 --> 44:08.344
               Ok.

44:10.114 --> 44:10.546
              <i>Julie?</i>

44:10.648 --> 44:12.015
              <i>Yeah?</i>

44:12.116 --> 44:13.850
  I gotta see him in person,
it's the 28th division, right?

44:13.951 --> 44:15.418
       <i>Yeah, I believe so.</i>

44:15.519 --> 44:16.719
      Ok, that's downtown.

44:16.820 --> 44:18.187
Wait, what about your meeting
        with Solomon?

44:18.288 --> 44:19.122
        Cover it for me.

44:19.223 --> 44:20.556
     I'll call Kurt from
          the road.

44:20.658 --> 44:21.858
   How are you going to call
  Kurt without a cell phone?

44:21.959 --> 44:23.960
 I haven't had a chance to go
      buy you a new one.

44:24.061 --> 44:25.094
      Well, give me yours.

44:25.195 --> 44:26.796
              Mine?

44:26.897 --> 44:28.431
     Yeah, Julie, you're
        my assistant.

44:28.532 --> 44:29.832
             Assist.

44:33.837 --> 44:35.571
       What's the matter?

44:35.673 --> 44:38.007
 Is there something you don't
        want me to see?

44:39.476 --> 44:40.877
              Nope.

44:42.680 --> 44:44.213
           Thank you.

44:49.019 --> 44:51.788
  Where's she going in such
          a hurry?

44:51.889 --> 44:53.556
              Out.

44:53.657 --> 44:55.858
         With my phone.

44:58.362 --> 45:01.297
: It was there, I saw it,
our family is in danger, Sarah!

45:01.398 --> 45:02.598
           Yeah, okay.

45:02.700 --> 45:04.000
    <i>We can't do nothing</i>
    <i>about this anymore!</i>

45:04.101 --> 45:06.469
             I know.

45:06.570 --> 45:08.304
     <i>I'm freaking out, okay.</i>

45:08.405 --> 45:09.005
              Yeah.

45:09.106 --> 45:10.073
       <i>Get back here soon!</i>

45:10.174 --> 45:11.074
            Well, ok.

45:11.175 --> 45:12.175
              Yeah.

45:12.276 --> 45:13.176
    <i>Thank god nobody was hurt!</i>

45:13.277 --> 45:14.444
   As long as everyone's safe.

45:14.545 --> 45:15.478
           <i>Define safe.</i>

45:15.579 --> 45:16.913
    Teri is safe, you're ok.

45:17.014 --> 45:18.147
   <i>I'm fine and Teri doesn't</i>
           <i>even know.</i>

45:18.248 --> 45:20.917
     Ok, um... well, I'm
   going to be home early,

45:21.018 --> 45:22.518
     I just have to check
         on something.

45:22.619 --> 45:24.187
   <i>Be careful! Extra careful!!</i>

45:24.288 --> 45:25.188
           I love you.

45:25.289 --> 45:25.755
         <i>I love you too.</i>

45:25.856 --> 45:26.622
               Ok.

45:26.724 --> 45:27.623
      <i>I mean it, I love you!</i>

45:27.725 --> 45:28.624
            Ok, bye.

45:28.726 --> 45:30.026
               <i>Bye!</i>

45:32.062 --> 45:35.064
   Hi. I need to speak with
       Lieutenant Stern.

45:38.769 --> 45:39.702
    Are you Lieutenant Stern?

45:39.803 --> 45:40.703
       No, Captain Tanner.

45:40.804 --> 45:42.171
          And you are?

45:42.272 --> 45:43.206
        I'm Sarah Miller.

45:43.307 --> 45:44.340
    Lieutenant Stern knows
           who I am.

45:44.441 --> 45:45.541
 It's very important I speak
          with him.

45:45.642 --> 45:46.609
  I'm afraid that's impossible.

45:46.710 --> 45:49.645
      Officer Stern died
        five years ago.

45:49.747 --> 45:51.714
              What?

45:51.815 --> 45:53.116
            It's him.

45:53.217 --> 45:53.816
           Excuse me?

45:53.917 --> 45:55.384
        What did you say?

45:57.788 --> 45:59.388
           Excuse me?

46:01.625 --> 46:02.325
          It's nothing.

46:02.426 --> 46:04.360
       Um, nothing, sorry.

46:04.461 --> 46:05.862
    Would you care to step
  into my office to discuss?

46:05.963 --> 46:08.064
         No, thank you.

46:08.165 --> 46:09.098
  I must have made a mistake
        with the name.

46:09.199 --> 46:11.234
      I'm sorry to have
        bothered you.

46:23.280 --> 46:25.915
     Look who's home early.

46:26.016 --> 46:27.683
       <i>Look what I drew</i>
       <i>at school today.</i>

46:27.785 --> 46:30.753
      <i>There's me, daddy,</i>
       <i>and there's you.</i>

46:30.854 --> 46:34.757
      Oh, that's beautiful.

46:34.858 --> 46:36.092
        Thank you, honey.

46:36.193 --> 46:39.362
This is the most beautiful thing
       I've seen all day.

46:39.463 --> 46:40.963
   <i>We'll have to get it framed.</i>

46:47.304 --> 46:52.108
  Ok, well, to celebrate this
beautiful picture you drew me,

46:52.209 --> 46:53.709
 who wants to go get ice cream?

46:53.811 --> 46:55.278
               Me!

46:55.379 --> 46:56.279
               Me.

46:56.380 --> 46:58.247
Go grab your jacket upstairs,
             ok?

46:58.348 --> 46:59.816
               <i>Ok!</i>

47:04.021 --> 47:06.722
          What's wrong?

47:06.824 --> 47:07.723
        A lot of things.

47:07.825 --> 47:09.125
    But first thing's first.

47:09.226 --> 47:10.726
     You said it was just
        you and George

47:10.828 --> 47:12.295
     who saw the package
      in the mail box?

47:12.396 --> 47:14.063
    No, it was some new guy.

47:14.164 --> 47:16.199
     Harold. Harold Martin.

47:16.300 --> 47:17.767
    What happened to George?

47:17.868 --> 47:20.903
 I don't know, family emergency.

47:21.004 --> 47:21.637
           All ready?

47:21.738 --> 47:22.371
              Yeah.

47:22.472 --> 47:23.539
          Ok. Let's go.

47:23.640 --> 47:25.041
       Let's go, come on.

47:32.082 --> 47:32.815
 You could describe him, right?

47:32.916 --> 47:34.116
        The new postman.

47:34.184 --> 47:35.184
  Yes, but he said he didn't
     deliver the package.

47:35.285 --> 47:36.285
     It was already there
       when he arrived.

47:36.386 --> 47:37.386
  Well maybe he can tell us
       a little more.

47:37.487 --> 47:39.455
        Right over here.

47:39.556 --> 47:41.190
     Um, I'm going to need
   to talk to your manager.

47:41.291 --> 47:42.792
      I'm the manager,
     how can I help you?

47:42.893 --> 47:44.794
  We have a question for one
    of your mail carriers.

47:44.895 --> 47:46.062
         Harold Martin?

47:46.163 --> 47:47.630
   He said he was replacing
    our original mail man.

47:47.731 --> 47:48.798
         George Reiner?

47:48.899 --> 47:51.534
About five foot nine, glasses,
         talked a lot.

47:51.635 --> 47:52.535
   It's not ringing any bells.

47:52.636 --> 47:54.604
    You say he's replacing
        George Reiner?

47:54.705 --> 47:55.438
              Yes.

47:55.539 --> 47:56.572
  George Reiner is on vacation

47:56.673 --> 47:59.041
     but his replacement
      is Nancy Johnson.

47:59.142 --> 48:00.409
          Are you sure?

48:00.510 --> 48:01.777
    Well then who the hell
       is Harold Martin

48:01.879 --> 48:03.813
     and why did he have
     access to our mail?

48:03.914 --> 48:06.582
I have no idea, but he doesn't
         work for us.

48:06.683 --> 48:08.117
 If you want to file a formal
         complaint...

48:08.218 --> 48:09.986
  No, that won't be necessary.

48:10.087 --> 48:13.456
           Thank you.

48:13.557 --> 48:14.624
      He's toying with us.

48:14.725 --> 48:16.025
              Who?

48:19.730 --> 48:21.197
          Where's Teri?

48:24.034 --> 48:24.567
             Teri?!

48:24.668 --> 48:25.935
              Teri!

48:31.341 --> 48:32.675
          There, there!

48:42.219 --> 48:43.452
      Come on, come on!!!!

48:47.491 --> 48:48.491
           That's him!

48:48.592 --> 48:49.725
   That's the post man from
         this morning.

48:49.826 --> 48:51.661
            KPJ I271.

48:51.762 --> 48:53.729
              Teri!

48:53.830 --> 48:56.699
            KPJ I271.

48:56.800 --> 49:00.169
     Oh my god, please never
 wander off like that again, ok?

49:00.270 --> 49:01.570
  You scared us half to death.

49:01.672 --> 49:03.639
   But I just wanted to pick
  out what kind of ice cream

49:03.740 --> 49:05.007
        I wanted to have.

49:09.279 --> 49:11.380
  Uh, three large cones please.

49:11.481 --> 49:13.082
      Sure. What flavour
        you folks like?

49:28.131 --> 49:30.266
   Take Teri to Louise's now!

49:30.367 --> 49:30.900
           What is it?

49:31.001 --> 49:32.501
            Just go.

49:32.602 --> 49:35.137
   Come on, let's go visit
   Aunt Louise right now.

49:43.113 --> 49:50.619
   <i>Pictures can't hurt you,</i>
       <i>but people can.</i>

49:50.721 --> 49:52.021
              <i>Nine?</i>

50:03.734 --> 50:04.600
              Yes?

50:04.701 --> 50:06.102
    Hey, it's me. It's Julie.

50:06.203 --> 50:07.770
   Where did you disappear to?

50:07.871 --> 50:10.740
   <i>I did my best to cover but</i>
  <i>Mr. Solomon is really upset</i>

50:10.841 --> 50:12.541
   <i>that you missed the meeting.</i>

50:12.642 --> 50:15.144
   <i>There's talk of firing you.</i>

50:15.245 --> 50:16.278
       Who's saying that?

50:16.380 --> 50:17.880
           <i>Mr. Solomon.</i>

50:17.981 --> 50:18.414
      Well, you know what?

50:18.515 --> 50:19.448
         Let him say it.

50:19.549 --> 50:20.883
   I can't worry about that
          right now.

50:20.984 --> 50:22.918
    Who else knows I have
      your cell, Julie?

50:23.020 --> 50:24.887
           <i>Besides me?</i>

50:24.988 --> 50:26.655
        Yes, besides you.

50:26.757 --> 50:30.459
    <i>I may have mentioned it</i>
     <i>in passing to Jackson.</i>

50:30.560 --> 50:31.394
          Anyone else?

50:31.495 --> 50:33.062
            <i>Like who?</i>

50:33.163 --> 50:34.930
    Like the person trying
      to destroy my life.

50:35.032 --> 50:37.033
  <i>Ok, now you're starting to</i>
    <i>scare me, Mrs. Miller.</i>

50:37.134 --> 50:38.567
     Yeah, you and me both.

51:00.557 --> 51:01.524
             Hello?

51:01.625 --> 51:03.325
          <i>Sarah Miller.</i>

51:03.427 --> 51:04.460
           <i>Who is this?</i>

51:04.561 --> 51:06.929
     <i>It's Lieutenant Stern</i>
         <i>calling again.</i>

51:07.030 --> 51:08.464
    <i>Lieutenant Stern is dead.</i>

51:08.565 --> 51:13.636
Oh, I mean it's Harold Martin
     <i>from the post office.</i>

51:13.737 --> 51:16.505
I was just calling to see if
   <i>you received my package.</i>

51:16.606 --> 51:17.973
  There is no Harold Martin
who works at the post office.

51:18.075 --> 51:19.975
      <i>Who the hell is this?</i>

51:20.077 --> 51:21.977
 Well now that's the million
      dollar question,

51:22.079 --> 51:23.846
        isn't it, Sarah?

51:26.583 --> 51:28.184
    What do you want from me?

51:28.285 --> 51:30.286
   <i>Maybe I don't want anything.</i>

51:30.387 --> 51:31.987
   Maybe someone else wants
          a job done

51:32.089 --> 51:35.458
  and I'm just the guy they
       hired to do it.

51:35.559 --> 51:40.196
   <i>Situations like this, they</i>
  <i>do arise from time to time.</i>

51:40.297 --> 51:41.630
         Who hired you?

51:41.731 --> 51:43.065
            <i>Now, now.</i>

51:43.166 --> 51:47.303
  Wouldn't be much of a game
if I told you all the answers.

51:47.404 --> 51:50.506
  That's a real nice family
  you've got there, Sarah.

51:50.607 --> 51:52.508
   <i>You think you can hold on</i>
            <i>to them?</i>

51:52.609 --> 51:56.912
     <i>I personally know some</i>
<i>families who weren't so lucky.</i>

51:57.013 --> 51:59.081
     Is that another threat?

51:59.182 --> 52:02.485
 Things happen for a reason,
           Sarah.

52:02.586 --> 52:04.920
   It might not be obvious
          at first,

52:05.021 --> 52:07.356
     <i>but everything has a</i>
      <i>cause and effect.</i>

52:07.457 --> 52:08.791
     <i>A beginning and an end.</i>

52:08.892 --> 52:15.598
    A sender and a receiver.

52:15.699 --> 52:19.168
    It just takes a while
    to figure it all out.

52:19.269 --> 52:21.837
And the clock is ticking, Sarah.

52:21.938 --> 52:25.508
     Or wasn't my package
         clear enough?

52:25.609 --> 52:27.176
    That's the thing about
         your package.

52:27.277 --> 52:28.577
      I didn't receive it.

52:28.678 --> 52:30.513
   Because you took it away
  before the police arrived.

52:30.614 --> 52:33.249
Well, it wasn't meant for them.

52:33.350 --> 52:36.385
   You have to open it, Sarah.

52:36.486 --> 52:40.523
 Ok, well tell me where you
 are and I'll be right over.

52:40.624 --> 52:43.826
   <i>No need, look under the bed.</i>

52:50.400 --> 52:54.637
Don't worry, it's not the kind
   of gift that goes "boom".

52:54.738 --> 52:57.740
       <i>That's not my style.</i>

52:57.841 --> 52:59.775
            Open it.

52:59.876 --> 53:01.277
           <i>Look inside.</i>

53:01.378 --> 53:04.613
     <i>There's a special little</i>
<i>something in there just for you.</i>

53:04.714 --> 53:06.715
      Do you want money
        or something?

53:06.816 --> 53:08.884
   Is that what this is about?

53:08.985 --> 53:10.653
   Because I'm pretty sure
     I just lost my job.

53:10.754 --> 53:11.887
             Money.

53:11.988 --> 53:15.724
  It's not about money, Sarah.

53:15.825 --> 53:17.259
       It's about family.

53:17.360 --> 53:20.996
      Family is everything.

53:21.097 --> 53:26.235
Can you protect those nearest
 and dearest to your heart?

53:26.336 --> 53:30.239
  Because you never know when
 it could all just slip away.

53:35.178 --> 53:36.812
        <i>Tick tock, Sarah.</i>

53:36.913 --> 53:38.647
           Tick tock.

53:38.748 --> 53:40.816
       I'll see you soon.

53:40.917 --> 53:42.284
              When?

53:42.385 --> 53:43.953
    When and where are you
         gonna see me?

53:44.054 --> 53:46.155
      'Cause I'm ready,
        you bastard.

53:46.256 --> 53:49.491
   <i>I'll chime back in around</i>
         <i>nine tonight.</i>

53:49.593 --> 53:51.393
        <i>If you're at home.</i>

53:58.468 --> 53:59.134
             Sarah?

53:59.236 --> 54:01.437
              Woah!

54:01.538 --> 54:03.038
              Hey.

54:06.409 --> 54:10.112
    Where did that come from?

54:10.213 --> 54:11.614
     He's been in our house.

54:11.715 --> 54:12.615
  He's been in our house again.

54:12.716 --> 54:13.949
         We have to go.

54:14.050 --> 54:16.819
 We have to pack and we have
         to get Teri

54:16.920 --> 54:17.886
 and we have to get out of here.

54:17.988 --> 54:19.054
              Now.

54:19.155 --> 54:20.589
               Ok.

54:21.791 --> 54:22.524
      Thanks again, Louise.

54:22.626 --> 54:23.525
   Oh, it's no problem at all.

54:23.627 --> 54:25.060
  I just hope everything's ok.

54:25.161 --> 54:27.396
    I mean, you're welcome
           to stay.

54:27.497 --> 54:29.798
   You guys are like family
            to me.

54:29.899 --> 54:32.868
  They are not your family,
           Louise.

54:32.969 --> 54:36.238
 I am well aware of that, Sarah.

54:36.339 --> 54:38.907
  I just thought that after
    the bomb scare today-

54:39.009 --> 54:40.509
   How do you know about that?

54:40.610 --> 54:42.044
    Everybody knows about it.

54:42.145 --> 54:43.045
       They closed down
       the whole block.

54:43.146 --> 54:44.146
   Louise was there when they-

54:44.247 --> 54:46.382
         Found nothing?

54:46.483 --> 54:48.851
     Oh, that's convenient.

54:48.952 --> 54:49.718
        Are you implying-

54:49.819 --> 54:51.020
           No, no, no.

54:51.121 --> 54:52.855
         Absolutely not.

54:52.956 --> 54:54.523
      Thanks again, Louise.

54:54.624 --> 54:57.159
  We're gonna get away for a
         little while,

54:57.260 --> 54:58.661
       but you've been
       a great friend.

54:58.762 --> 55:01.597
 Look, you take care of yourself
            and Teri.

55:01.698 --> 55:03.832
    If you need anything,
        you call me.

55:03.933 --> 55:04.600
             I will.

55:04.701 --> 55:07.403
           Thank you.

55:08.171 --> 55:09.872
          Hey, it's me.

55:09.973 --> 55:12.107
   I've just discovered that
  my office has been bugged.

55:12.208 --> 55:14.209
     The boys in blue are
        watching me now

55:14.311 --> 55:17.279
    so all assignments are
      on permanent hold.

55:17.380 --> 55:20.015
     It isn't safe anymore.

55:20.116 --> 55:22.584
       You're on your own.

55:49.579 --> 55:50.546
      Room 129 around back.

55:50.647 --> 55:52.281
       Just follow me, ok?

56:00.423 --> 56:02.624
       <i>Make sure to wash</i>
       <i>behind your ears.</i>

56:02.726 --> 56:04.126
               <i>Ok.</i>

56:09.666 --> 56:10.999
          What is this?

56:11.101 --> 56:13.535
    Who are all these people?

56:13.636 --> 56:15.437
  They look like dead people
            to me.

56:15.538 --> 56:18.707
 I think the message is petty
      obvious, don't you?

56:18.808 --> 56:20.609
     Well, this definitely
   looks like a threat now.

56:20.710 --> 56:23.579
     Something we can go
     to the police with.

56:23.680 --> 56:28.384
  That's not the only threat
    I received today, Kurt.

56:28.485 --> 56:30.753
I was able to take a screen grab
     of the photo this time.

56:30.854 --> 56:33.689
       Silence is golden.

56:33.790 --> 56:36.325
     Look at the picture
     that came with it.

56:39.562 --> 56:40.262
              Yeah.

56:40.363 --> 56:41.530
   We can't go to the police.

56:41.631 --> 56:44.299
      I can't chance it,
    not with you and Teri.

56:44.401 --> 56:46.034
        Who is this guy?

56:46.136 --> 56:47.236
  I don't know, that's what
  I'm trying to figure out.

56:47.337 --> 56:50.305
   Who's behind him pulling
         the strings?

56:52.308 --> 56:53.108
           Oh, great.

56:53.209 --> 56:54.743
         It's Victoria.

56:54.844 --> 56:56.512
           Answer it.

56:59.149 --> 57:01.049
       What is it, Vicki?

57:01.151 --> 57:01.984
         <i>We need to talk.</i>

57:02.085 --> 57:03.986
      It's not a good time.

57:04.087 --> 57:05.053
          <i>Where are you?</i>

57:05.155 --> 57:06.255
            I'm out.

57:06.356 --> 57:07.256
            <i>Out where?</i>

57:07.357 --> 57:10.259
   It doesn't matter where,
           I'm out.

57:10.360 --> 57:11.660
     <i>Is my daughter with you?</i>

57:11.761 --> 57:14.463
        Teri is fine,
     she's with me, yes.

57:14.564 --> 57:15.731
         <i>Well, is she ok?</i>

57:15.832 --> 57:17.266
        Yes, she's fine.

57:17.367 --> 57:19.001
     <i>Well, I want to see her.</i>

57:19.102 --> 57:20.402
        Well, you can't.

57:20.503 --> 57:22.471
If I can't see her I'm calling
        <i>child services.</i>

57:22.572 --> 57:24.072
        Go ahead. Do it.

57:24.174 --> 57:26.308
          I don't care.

57:26.409 --> 57:28.410
         What'd she say?

57:28.511 --> 57:29.912
   Same thing she tells me
        all the time.

57:30.013 --> 57:31.647
That she's going to take Teri
        away from me.

57:31.748 --> 57:35.083
  She's going to ruin my life.

57:35.185 --> 57:38.287
  She's got to wait in line,
             now.

57:38.388 --> 57:41.323
  If she's behind this I bet
    she's jumping for joy.

57:41.424 --> 57:42.991
     Do you really think
      she's in on this?

57:43.092 --> 57:44.493
  She has a good enough motive.

57:44.594 --> 57:47.095
         She wants Teri.

57:47.197 --> 57:52.167
 Of course, Louise wants Teri
    and you all to herself.

57:52.268 --> 57:54.436
  I just have to worry about
  Jackson, who wants my job.

57:54.537 --> 57:56.839
    Well, probably has it
           by now.

57:56.940 --> 57:58.273
          And Julie...

57:58.374 --> 58:00.108
        What about Julie?

58:00.210 --> 58:01.877
     That's her cell phone.

58:01.978 --> 58:03.512
    The threat came to me
       on that phone.

58:03.613 --> 58:06.949
  No one knew I borrowed it
       except for her.

58:07.050 --> 58:09.318
 Wait, give me your cell phone.

58:09.419 --> 58:10.953
    What're you looking for?

58:11.054 --> 58:13.055
  To see if you've been tapped.

58:13.156 --> 58:14.623
      Once they get into
       someone's system

58:14.724 --> 58:17.359
 they can triangulate where you
 are, access your address books,

58:17.460 --> 58:20.729
   your contacts, everything.

58:20.830 --> 58:24.967
   It's scary how easy it is.

58:25.068 --> 58:28.003
   They can get to anyone
calling you, anyone you call.

58:28.104 --> 58:29.404
    This is like a nightmare.

58:29.506 --> 58:33.008
  Yeah, except that it's real.

58:33.109 --> 58:35.244
        Just to be safe.

58:40.950 --> 58:41.884
              <i>Daddy?</i>

58:41.985 --> 58:44.086
  Betty and Cheryl are hungry.

58:44.187 --> 58:47.356
             <i>Me too.</i>

58:47.457 --> 58:48.690
  You want to find out what
      Teri wants to eat

58:48.791 --> 58:50.726
     and I'll call take out?

58:50.827 --> 58:52.561
              Yeah.

59:09.946 --> 59:13.715
Hello, Harrison Car Rentals,
     <i>how can I help you?</i>

59:13.816 --> 59:14.349
           Oh, great.

59:14.450 --> 59:15.083
       You're still open.

59:15.184 --> 59:15.918
           <i>Well, yeah.</i>

59:16.019 --> 59:17.185
     <i>We shouldn't be, though.</i>

59:17.287 --> 59:18.220
     <i>The owner's making me</i>
      <i>re-file everything.</i>

59:18.321 --> 59:20.022
        <i>It totally sucks.</i>

59:20.123 --> 59:22.558
     I'm sorry to hear that.

59:22.659 --> 59:25.794
  This is a little bit awkward.

59:25.895 --> 59:27.396
 I had a bit of a fender bender

59:27.497 --> 59:29.464
       with one of your
      rental cars today.

59:29.566 --> 59:31.133
    <i>Oh great, more paperwork.</i>

59:31.234 --> 59:33.602
  Well, maybe I can help out
          with that.

59:33.703 --> 59:35.037
 The man that I hit was very
        nice about it

59:35.138 --> 59:36.638
      and we're fixing
    the damages ourselves

59:36.739 --> 59:39.641
so that you won't be burdened
     by more paperwork.

59:39.742 --> 59:42.044
            I just...

59:42.145 --> 59:44.146
   I misplaced the address
       that he gave me

59:44.247 --> 59:45.781
    and I don't know where
      to send the cheque.

59:45.882 --> 59:47.649
      Would you be a dear
    and look it up for me?

59:47.750 --> 59:50.786
I'm sure you have his license
       on file, right?

59:50.887 --> 59:53.388
   I have the license plate
            number.

59:53.489 --> 59:54.756
         Are you ready?

59:54.857 --> 59:58.961
          It's KPJI271.

59:59.062 --> 01:00:02.564
 I think it was a gold Hyundai.

01:00:02.665 --> 01:00:04.666
Well, I'm really not supposed
           <i>to do this</i>

01:00:04.767 --> 01:00:07.903
but it makes my life easier,
    <i>so just give me a second.</i>

01:00:08.004 --> 01:00:11.506
           Thank you.

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:15.110
      And in other news,
 police located international

01:00:15.211 --> 01:00:18.780
  assassin Mathieu Diamond,
  possibly finally solving

01:00:18.881 --> 01:00:21.583
 a string of unsolved homicides

01:00:21.684 --> 01:00:27.456
   including the two year old
 murder case of Jennifer Serols.

01:00:27.557 --> 01:00:29.458
  <i>It's registered to a Vincent</i>
  <i>Sturup at 23330 McIntosh Plaz.</i>

01:00:29.559 --> 01:00:31.927
               Ok.

01:00:32.028 --> 01:00:34.429
       Thank you so much.

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:38.200
            Ok, bye.

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:41.303
    ...under surveillance
     the last two weeks.

01:00:41.404 --> 01:00:44.473
  When police tried to bring
him in he shot at the officers

01:00:44.574 --> 01:00:46.041
       who returned fire.

01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:49.611
    Mr. Diamond was killed
     during the gun play.

01:00:49.712 --> 01:00:51.947
   Mr. Mathieu Diamond was...

01:00:52.048 --> 01:00:54.316
   She says she wants burgers.

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:56.718
...was in actuality a contact
   <i>person for an organization</i>

01:00:56.819 --> 01:00:59.154
of hired assassins resulting
        <i>in the deaths</i>

01:00:59.255 --> 01:01:03.558
      <i>of at least two dozen</i>
<i>people over the last few years.</i>

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.627
           You idiots.

01:01:05.728 --> 01:01:08.630
     Now they're gonna run.

01:01:08.731 --> 01:01:11.133
       This ends tonight.

01:01:13.102 --> 01:01:15.170
 Do you think that our guy is
       involved in this?

01:01:15.271 --> 01:01:17.506
 Is this what we're mixed up in?

01:01:17.607 --> 01:01:18.306
         It's ok, Kurt.

01:01:18.408 --> 01:01:19.007
           No, no, no.

01:01:19.108 --> 01:01:20.375
    It is definitely not ok.

01:01:20.476 --> 01:01:21.810
   If this guy is a trained
  assassin, a trained killer

01:01:21.911 --> 01:01:22.811
          it is not ok.

01:01:22.912 --> 01:01:25.047
        The police are
       on the case now.

01:01:25.148 --> 01:01:27.182
     So it's going to be ok.

01:01:27.283 --> 01:01:28.250
             Right?

01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:30.552
   We're fine here, we just
        have to relax.

01:01:30.653 --> 01:01:32.921
           We're safe.

01:01:33.022 --> 01:01:34.690
              Kurt?

01:01:34.791 --> 01:01:35.590
              Kurt?

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:36.525
              What?

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:37.392
            Hey, hey.

01:01:37.493 --> 01:01:39.027
              What?

01:01:39.128 --> 01:01:42.531
     We've gotta eat, right?

01:01:42.632 --> 01:01:43.765
              Yeah.

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:46.101
 I think I saw a burger place
       on the way here.

01:01:46.202 --> 01:01:47.402
       You stay with Teri,

01:01:47.503 --> 01:01:48.937
 I'll run and grab something
      really quick, ok?

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:50.205
       I'll be right back.

01:01:50.306 --> 01:01:52.340
   But you saw the report,
     it's too dangerous.

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:56.511
 Ok, well I have this, remember?

01:01:56.612 --> 01:01:57.946
      Make you feel better?

01:01:58.047 --> 01:02:01.917
 And that guy, whoever it is,
  he's on the run right now.

01:02:02.018 --> 01:02:05.687
   No hamburger ever killed
            anyone.

01:02:05.788 --> 01:02:08.623
   At least not when eaten
       in moderation.

01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:10.058
         Aw, come here.

01:02:10.159 --> 01:02:11.893
       That was supposed
      to make you laugh.

01:02:11.994 --> 01:02:14.196
            We're ok.

01:03:49.258 --> 01:03:51.560
          Mrs. Miller?

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:52.761
             Julie?

01:03:52.862 --> 01:03:56.164
  I needed to speak with you
       about something.

01:03:56.265 --> 01:03:57.699
   You're three minutes early.

01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:58.834
     You were expecting me?

01:03:58.935 --> 01:04:01.203
    I was expecting someone.

01:04:01.304 --> 01:04:03.672
   I was really concerned
after I spoke with you today.

01:04:03.773 --> 01:04:04.739
    Well, you should have
         called me.

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:06.441
    You of all people know
       how to reach me.

01:04:06.542 --> 01:04:07.909
 Yeah, but it's not the kind
  of thing you tell someone

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:10.212
         over the phone.

01:04:10.313 --> 01:04:11.613
 Or with a gun pointed at them.

01:04:11.714 --> 01:04:12.347
        I'll decide that.

01:04:12.448 --> 01:04:15.116
              Talk.

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:17.686
      You were fired today.

01:04:17.787 --> 01:04:20.188
             Me too.

01:04:20.289 --> 01:04:21.523
        They let you go?

01:04:21.624 --> 01:04:22.924
 Well yeah, there's no point
   in having an assistant

01:04:23.025 --> 01:04:24.593
   if there's no one there
         to assist.

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:26.061
   How did you get in here,
           and when?

01:04:26.162 --> 01:04:28.129
    The door was wide open
      just a minute ago.

01:04:28.231 --> 01:04:29.464
 I knocked but no one answered.

01:04:29.565 --> 01:04:32.801
    I was really worried,
        Mrs. Miller.

01:04:32.902 --> 01:04:35.003
           That's it?

01:04:35.104 --> 01:04:37.439
      And I kinda needed
        my phone back.

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:43.011
       Ok, I believe you.

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:46.615
      What's with the gun?

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:47.749
 When you show up to your house

01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:48.984
  and find someone uninvited
        walking around

01:04:49.085 --> 01:04:52.554
  you take certain precautions.

01:04:52.655 --> 01:04:55.056
  No, but there's something
       else going on.

01:04:55.157 --> 01:04:56.625
  The way you've been acting
          this week.

01:04:57.526 --> 01:04:59.494
       It's nine o'clock.

01:05:02.198 --> 01:05:04.266
              Wait.

01:05:08.838 --> 01:05:10.972
<i>Pictures can't</i>
       <i>hurt us, right?</i>

01:05:11.073 --> 01:05:13.174
<i>Pictures can't</i>
           <i>hurt us.</i>

01:05:13.276 --> 01:05:14.509
<i>I love you, Sarah.</i>

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:16.845
<i>I love you, too.</i>

01:05:16.946 --> 01:05:19.014
<i>Pictures can't</i>
       <i>hurt us, right?</i>

01:05:19.115 --> 01:05:21.783
<i>Pictures can't</i>
           <i>hurt us.</i>

01:05:21.884 --> 01:05:23.151
<i>I love you, Sarah.</i>

01:05:23.252 --> 01:05:25.921
<i>I love you, too.</i>

01:05:26.022 --> 01:05:27.822
<i>Pictures</i>
     <i>can't hurt us, right?</i>

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:30.492
<i>Pictures</i>
        <i>can't hurt us.</i>

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:32.294
<i>I love you,</i>
           <i>Sarah.</i>

01:05:32.395 --> 01:05:34.262
<i>I love you, too.</i>

01:05:34.363 --> 01:05:36.197
<i>Pictures</i>
     <i>can't hurt us, right?</i>

01:05:36.299 --> 01:05:38.767
<i>Pictures</i>
        <i>can't hurt us.</i>

01:05:38.868 --> 01:05:40.335
<i>I love</i>
         <i>you, Sarah.</i>

01:05:40.436 --> 01:05:42.437
<i>I love you, too.</i>

01:05:42.538 --> 01:05:44.839
<i>Pictures</i>
     <i>can't hurt us, right?</i>

01:05:48.644 --> 01:05:50.979
 Mrs. Miller, what is going on?!

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.113
     You drove here, right?

01:05:52.214 --> 01:05:53.515
     Yeah, I just parked
     across the street.

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:54.983
    I have one last favour
          to ask you.

01:05:55.084 --> 01:05:56.885
   I need to borrow your car.

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:45.967
          Good evening.

01:07:46.195 --> 01:07:48.530
         What the hell?

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:11.953
       You son of a bitch.

01:08:12.054 --> 01:08:14.589
   That's how you could get
       to all my phones.

01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:16.925
     It's in Kurt's cell,
          I knew it.

01:08:28.504 --> 01:08:38.446
            Oh my...

01:08:38.546 --> 01:08:54.662
            Oh my...

01:09:17.118 --> 01:09:18.953
          Stupid cops.

01:09:39.942 --> 01:09:40.774
             Hello?

01:09:40.876 --> 01:09:42.042
          <i>Kurt, it's me.</i>

01:09:42.144 --> 01:09:42.743
           Thank god.

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:43.611
      Sarah, where are you?

01:09:43.712 --> 01:09:44.444
I was going to call the police.

01:09:44.546 --> 01:09:46.214
   No, don't call the police.

01:09:46.314 --> 01:09:48.448
    The guy who's after us
       used to be a cop.

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:49.384
              What?

01:09:49.484 --> 01:09:50.551
   <i>I'm at his place right now,</i>

01:09:50.653 --> 01:09:51.452
 he might still have friends
        in the force.

01:09:51.554 --> 01:09:53.888
   We can't trust the police.

01:09:53.988 --> 01:09:55.523
 But I might have found proof
  that can take this guy down

01:09:55.624 --> 01:09:56.891
     <i>and put us in the clear.</i>

01:09:56.992 --> 01:09:58.526
     <i>I have to run back to</i>
    <i>the house for a minute.</i>

01:09:58.627 --> 01:10:01.262
I need you to stay with Teri
and I will be there very soon.

01:10:01.363 --> 01:10:03.565
    You can't go back to
  the house, it isn't safe.

01:10:03.666 --> 01:10:04.866
      I'm going to be fine.

01:10:04.967 --> 01:10:07.802
  Everything is going to be
     fine now, trust me.

01:10:07.903 --> 01:10:10.271
        I love you, Kurt.

01:10:10.372 --> 01:10:12.507
             Sarah.

01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:36.397
       Louise? It's Kurt.

01:10:36.498 --> 01:10:53.815
     I need another favour.

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:51.806
             Sarah?

01:11:51.907 --> 01:11:53.408
              <i>Kurt?</i>

01:11:53.509 --> 01:11:54.876
       Hello, Mr. Miller.

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:58.579
          Remember me?

01:11:58.681 --> 01:12:00.782
     It looks like we're
        out of time.

01:12:00.883 --> 01:12:02.350
      <i>When did you get here?</i>

01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:09.190
 I had to stop off and get gas.

01:12:20.803 --> 01:12:25.106
         So here we are.

01:12:25.207 --> 01:12:26.407
          Where's Teri?

01:12:26.508 --> 01:12:27.408
           She's safe.

01:12:27.509 --> 01:12:28.176
    A friend is watching her.

01:12:28.277 --> 01:12:31.646
       Safe. For how long?

01:12:31.747 --> 01:12:34.916
    What's in the bag, Sarah?

01:12:35.017 --> 01:12:36.117
       You know who I am?

01:12:36.218 --> 01:12:38.486
  Well, I know who you are,
      too, Mr. Sturup.

01:12:38.587 --> 01:12:41.522
  That surveillance system,
     pretty good set-up.

01:12:41.623 --> 01:12:42.924
        State of the art.

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:44.759
          Open the bag.

01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:58.940
        Ah, my past life.

01:12:59.041 --> 01:13:00.641
  It feels good to come clean.

01:13:00.743 --> 01:13:02.043
       You should try it.

01:13:02.144 --> 01:13:03.978
  Why are you doing this to us?

01:13:04.079 --> 01:13:05.213
     Did Victoria hire you?

01:13:05.314 --> 01:13:06.781
          The ex-wife?

01:13:06.882 --> 01:13:07.882
         No, Mr. Miller.

01:13:07.983 --> 01:13:08.649
  She doesn't have anything
       to do with it.

01:13:08.751 --> 01:13:09.450
         Where's Julie?

01:13:09.551 --> 01:13:10.785
    What did you do with her?

01:13:10.886 --> 01:13:11.719
              Who?

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:12.887
             Julie?

01:13:12.988 --> 01:13:13.521
         Oh, thank god!

01:13:13.622 --> 01:13:15.056
         There you are!

01:14:00.169 --> 01:14:01.436
        Jennifer Serols.

01:14:01.537 --> 01:14:03.171
     Your daughter, I know.

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:05.039
You killed her like you killed
  all the others you monster!

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:06.040
        Get off my wife!

01:14:06.141 --> 01:14:08.342
      Wait, let me explain.

01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:09.076
         Let me explain.

01:14:09.178 --> 01:14:10.077
         You don't know-

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:19.754
  You did it, you stopped him!

01:14:19.855 --> 01:14:21.022
      Yes, with your help.

01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:22.156
   There's another gun over
    there under the couch.

01:14:22.257 --> 01:14:23.591
       Go, I'll watch him

01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:29.831
            Pathetic.

01:14:32.334 --> 01:14:33.768
           Oh my god!

01:14:33.869 --> 01:14:36.237
             Julie.

01:14:36.338 --> 01:14:37.872
    What are you doing here?

01:14:37.973 --> 01:14:38.940
    What are you doing here?

01:14:49.117 --> 01:14:53.754
  I think now we call the cops!

01:14:53.856 --> 01:14:55.389
         Not quite yet.

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:56.557
           Watch out!

01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:58.226
           Ahhhhh!!!!

01:14:58.327 --> 01:14:59.627
              Kurt!

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:09.804
             Sarah?

01:15:09.905 --> 01:15:12.039
    Well, this was going
    to happen inevitably.

01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:15.376
   However unfortunate the
covers are alwscovered.

01:15:15.477 --> 01:15:17.545
   I told you to stay away,
            honey.

01:15:17.646 --> 01:15:18.513
       I don't understand.

01:15:18.614 --> 01:15:20.915
     Your wife is a killer.

01:15:21.016 --> 01:15:23.417
    She murdered my daughter.

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:25.720
     That was your fault,
           not mine.

01:15:25.821 --> 01:15:28.756
  You were getting too close
   with your investigation.

01:15:28.857 --> 01:15:30.691
            Why her?

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:32.927
           Why not me?

01:15:33.028 --> 01:15:35.663
    Because killing a cop
    makes matters worse.

01:15:35.764 --> 01:15:39.867
     Killing his daughter
      makes it personal,

01:15:39.968 --> 01:15:41.502
    therefore removing you
        from the case.

01:15:41.603 --> 01:15:44.171
 It's police procedure, Vincent,
         you know that!

01:15:44.273 --> 01:15:45.740
              Hey!

01:15:45.841 --> 01:15:47.341
            Sit down!

01:15:47.442 --> 01:15:50.711
            Sit down!

01:15:50.812 --> 01:15:56.617
     You killed everyone
    in those photographs?

01:15:56.718 --> 01:15:57.451
     They were assignments.

01:15:57.553 --> 01:15:59.253
       It wasn't personal.

01:15:59.354 --> 01:16:00.755
           I'm a pro.

01:16:00.856 --> 01:16:05.092
    Your job in the city,
         our family.

01:16:05.193 --> 01:16:08.763
       That was my cover.

01:16:08.864 --> 01:16:10.698
 One's got to keep a low profile
        in this business.

01:16:10.799 --> 01:16:12.533
Who's going to suspect a married
       woman with a child?

01:16:12.634 --> 01:16:13.401
      You certainly didn't.

01:16:13.502 --> 01:16:15.136
          Put that on.

01:16:15.237 --> 01:16:16.904
          Who are you?

01:16:17.005 --> 01:16:19.340
     Ah, ah, ah Mr. Officer.

01:16:36.825 --> 01:16:38.426
      How did you find me?

01:16:38.527 --> 01:16:40.661
       Mathieu, I imagine.

01:16:40.762 --> 01:16:42.663
          You're right.

01:16:42.764 --> 01:16:46.067
      After Jenny's death
  they took me off the case.

01:16:46.168 --> 01:16:47.568
        I quit the force.

01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:49.904
  I've been looking for you
         ever since.

01:16:50.005 --> 01:16:51.072
<i>You okay?</i>

01:16:51.173 --> 01:16:53.474
        Hey! Don't move!

01:16:53.575 --> 01:16:54.709
               Ok.

01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:59.480
 You know, Mathieu called me
       a few days ago.

01:16:59.581 --> 01:17:01.315
    Hired me to take you out.

01:17:01.416 --> 01:17:02.750
        Of course I know.

01:17:02.851 --> 01:17:05.086
       I ordered the hit.

01:17:05.187 --> 01:17:06.253
          On yourself?

01:17:06.355 --> 01:17:07.588
    After I tapped his phones

01:17:07.689 --> 01:17:10.825
 I knew he'd reach out to his
     number one employee.

01:17:10.926 --> 01:17:13.527
That's how I located this house.

01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:17.164
 I just didn't know which one
    of you was the killer.

01:17:17.265 --> 01:17:23.938
 You triangulated my location
    using my private cell?

01:17:24.039 --> 01:17:27.041
          That's smart.

01:17:27.142 --> 01:17:28.376
     You didn't come for me.

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:30.044
Well, you kept me pretty busy
     the last few days,

01:17:30.145 --> 01:17:31.212
       didn't you, honey?

01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:33.981
    Wait, what private cell?

01:17:34.082 --> 01:17:37.251
There was a reason I didn't want
your little brat in my closet.

01:17:47.863 --> 01:17:49.263
          What is that?

01:17:50.332 --> 01:17:52.600
   What I was coming to get
         when I found

01:17:52.701 --> 01:17:56.270
    Julie snooping around
        here tonight.

01:17:56.371 --> 01:17:58.606
 Yeah, it's her private line
     to Mathieu Diamond.

01:17:58.707 --> 01:18:00.641
  No, it's a secure line to me.

01:18:00.742 --> 01:18:03.377
        Calls come in,
      they don't go out.

01:18:03.478 --> 01:18:04.845
   It's a safety precaution
         Mathieu made

01:18:04.946 --> 01:18:09.717
in case I was tracked down and
 it couldn't get back to him.

01:18:09.818 --> 01:18:10.985
But then I saw the news tonight,

01:18:11.086 --> 01:18:13.621
     apparently your boys
      found another way.

01:18:13.722 --> 01:18:15.556
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

01:18:15.657 --> 01:18:17.625
I've just discovered that my
   <i>office has been bugged.</i>

01:18:17.726 --> 01:18:19.326
     <i>The boys in blue are</i>
       <i>watching me now</i>

01:18:19.428 --> 01:18:22.396
    <i>so all assignments are</i>
      <i>on permanent hold.</i>

01:18:22.497 --> 01:18:25.066
      <i>It's not safe anymore.</i>

01:18:25.167 --> 01:18:28.703
       <i>You're on your own.</i>

01:18:28.804 --> 01:18:30.738
           That I am.

01:18:34.443 --> 01:18:37.344
    Nice working with you,
           Mathieu.

01:18:37.446 --> 01:18:39.513
  What are you planning to do?

01:18:39.614 --> 01:18:41.449
        Time to move on.

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:45.119
     Cover's been blown,
    police are moving in,

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:48.155
  escape plan is now in effect.

01:18:48.256 --> 01:18:49.990
I was planning to not survive
         the night.

01:18:50.092 --> 01:18:52.393
    Now I'm afraid neither
          of us can.

01:18:55.263 --> 01:18:57.732
  I mentioned I had to stop
        off for gas.

01:19:01.737 --> 01:19:05.706
I imagine tomorrow's headline
  will read something like

01:19:05.807 --> 01:19:10.644
   "poor, aspiring novelist
Kurt Miller and his wife Sarah

01:19:10.746 --> 01:19:14.515
      were found murdered
    in their suburban home

01:19:14.616 --> 01:19:16.250
        late last night,

01:19:16.351 --> 01:19:21.288
 victims of ex-police officer
        Vincent Sturup

01:19:21.389 --> 01:19:24.458
who, in a psychotic fit of rage,

01:19:24.559 --> 01:19:30.998
   decided to take the law
     into his own hands.

01:19:31.099 --> 01:19:37.938
     Then, in an attempt
   to conceal his actions,

01:19:38.039 --> 01:19:46.847
 he started a fire that consumed
        himself as well."

01:19:46.948 --> 01:19:49.049
     I think it's brilliant.

01:19:49.151 --> 01:19:52.386
 I mean, really, it's pretty
     close to the truth.

01:19:52.487 --> 01:19:54.789
Except Sarah Miller the deceased

01:19:54.890 --> 01:20:00.094
 will be played by the newcomer,
         Julie Kriegel.

01:20:00.195 --> 01:20:01.562
              Yeah.

01:20:01.663 --> 01:20:04.532
   By the time they discover
 they're your burned remains,

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:09.904
 I'll be far away from here,
   a new car, a new life,

01:20:10.005 --> 01:20:12.339
         a new identity.

01:20:23.552 --> 01:20:25.119
        Nice try, honey.

01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:27.388
     I understand, I know
       you're upset ok?

01:20:27.489 --> 01:20:30.090
 I promise to kill you last,
          alright?

01:20:30.192 --> 01:20:32.893
             Argh!!!

01:20:59.955 --> 01:21:02.323
      Time to finish this.

01:21:09.297 --> 01:21:14.435
    Honey, what're you doing?

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:18.072
  You're not going to kill me.

01:21:18.173 --> 01:21:22.977
    Kurt, you love me, right?

01:21:23.078 --> 01:21:24.278
             Loved.

01:21:25.914 --> 01:21:27.948
           Past tense.

01:21:28.049 --> 01:21:31.819
  You know it's not so easy
     to murder someone.

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:33.921
   It takes a certain type
  of person to be a killer.

01:21:38.093 --> 01:21:44.665
      And you, sweetie,
   you aren't that person.

01:22:04.319 --> 01:22:05.886
    Like I said, Mrs. Miller.

01:22:08.290 --> 01:22:10.524
          You're fired.

01:22:33.481 --> 01:22:37.384
I feel like I should thank you
        and apologize.

01:22:37.485 --> 01:22:39.253
     I don't really want
        to do either.

01:22:39.354 --> 01:22:43.324
   I feel the same way, so why
 don't we just leave it at that?

01:22:43.425 --> 01:22:45.259
 Take care of that little girl.

01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:56.170
          How are you?

01:22:56.271 --> 01:22:58.572
          I'll be fine.

01:22:58.673 --> 01:23:00.841
    I don't know what to say.

01:23:00.942 --> 01:23:02.710
       You saved my life.

01:23:02.811 --> 01:23:04.912
     You saved mine, first.

01:23:05.013 --> 01:23:06.714
   I guess that makes us even.

01:23:06.815 --> 01:23:08.415
     Although I am still
        out of a job.

01:23:08.516 --> 01:23:10.884
 Well, all of this does give
 me an idea for a new novel,

01:23:10.986 --> 01:23:12.252
  and I could use an assistant.

01:23:12.354 --> 01:23:13.554
             Really?

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:16.123
     Someone with intimate
  knowledge of the material.

01:23:16.224 --> 01:23:17.591
     How's your health plan?

01:23:17.692 --> 01:23:19.626
  It's improving by the minute.

01:23:21.529 --> 01:23:23.230
              <i>Daddy!</i>

01:23:23.331 --> 01:23:25.699
Come here, come here, come here,
          come here!!!!

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:26.867
          Oh, ho, ho...

01:23:26.968 --> 01:23:28.002
      My one and only love.

01:23:28.103 --> 01:23:30.004
            Hi, baby.
