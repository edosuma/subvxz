WEBVTT

00:23.607 --> 00:25.859
<i>Close combat</i>
<i>I'm slashing</i>

00:26.276 --> 00:30.906
<i>You who are standing in front of me</i>
<i>Who are you?</i>

00:36.995 --> 00:38.163
AJIN: DEMI-HUMAN

00:38.247 --> 00:43.168
<i>Running away but not forever</i>
<i>Chewing and swallowing reality</i>

00:43.252 --> 00:47.214
<i>Shout it out</i>
<i>And refuse ambiguity</i>

00:47.714 --> 00:51.093
<i>Though you know the danger of the dark</i>

00:51.176 --> 00:54.012
<i>A type of system that is too cold</i>

00:54.096 --> 00:57.182
<i>On or off</i>
<i>Which one is it now?</i>

00:58.433 --> 01:02.604
<i>Ending up killing emotions</i>
<i>Over and over</i>

01:02.688 --> 01:08.068
<i>No, I was just slipping through</i>
<i>Being destroyed, that's all</i>

01:08.777 --> 01:11.405
<i>Leave me alone</i>
<i>Craze</i>

01:11.488 --> 01:15.158
<i>I am I</i>
<i>Even if I am cornered</i>

01:15.242 --> 01:16.493
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

01:16.577 --> 01:19.329
<i>Started with nothing but risk</i>
<i>From the beginning</i>

01:19.413 --> 01:21.915
<i>Give it all you got</i>
<i>Craze</i>

01:21.999 --> 01:27.004
<i>Reveal your true self, your instincts</i>
<i>Time to strike back</i>

01:27.087 --> 01:29.339
<i>Yeah</i>
<i>So I slashed</i>

01:29.423 --> 01:31.925
<i>Who are you?</i>

01:47.107 --> 01:50.444
I'M GETTING SICK OF THIS

02:22.601 --> 02:25.646
I wasn't expecting you
to actually be waiting.

02:26.730 --> 02:29.441
People are supposed to greet
their superiors, I thought.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.861
If a decision has been made,
hurry up and say it.

02:34.279 --> 02:38.825
Sir... you're being removed
from the Ajin Control Commission.

02:39.743 --> 02:41.119
It's only natural.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.789
The Man With The Hat did all that killing.

02:44.206 --> 02:47.876
And tonight,
you let Nagai and Nakano escape.

02:48.043 --> 02:49.294
That can't be...

02:50.087 --> 02:51.046
Mr. Tosaki.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.674
What will happen to me?

02:55.217 --> 02:59.388
I told you before. You'll go to hell.

03:01.181 --> 03:04.017
But... the situation has suddenly changed.

03:04.851 --> 03:08.230
I would say that you might even have
a shred of hope left after all.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.690
Come on, let's go.

03:12.734 --> 03:13.735
What happened?

03:14.903 --> 03:18.740
The Man With The Hat...
has made a second threat.

03:21.618 --> 03:22.494
MESSAGE FROM SATO

03:22.577 --> 03:26.832
<i>Today, I determined</i>
<i>that we will begin the second wave.</i>

03:27.749 --> 03:33.380
<i>Humans have brashly and without shame</i>
<i>escalated their oppression of Ajin.</i>

03:33.755 --> 03:37.092
<i>The theme of the second wave</i>
<i>is "cleansing."</i>

03:38.260 --> 03:42.472
<i>Using information Tanaka overheard</i>
<i>while he was being held,</i>

03:42.556 --> 03:45.016
<i>we've made a list of 15 representatives</i>

03:45.100 --> 03:47.310
<i>of the organizations conspiring</i>
<i>against us.</i>

03:48.103 --> 03:51.982
<i>And if the government doesn't</i>
<i>promptly agree to all my demands...</i>

03:53.024 --> 03:57.028
<i>we will assassinate these 15 individuals.</i>

03:58.238 --> 04:01.324
This was downloaded from AJIN.net.

04:04.453 --> 04:07.122
Dr. Kishi, and even the minister...

04:08.582 --> 04:10.625
The Man With The Hat has two demands:

04:10.709 --> 04:15.130
First, they want you to give official
and detailed reports

04:15.213 --> 04:17.716
on all profits the government
and its affiliates

04:17.799 --> 04:21.678
have gained
from its experimentation on Ajin.

04:22.137 --> 04:25.599
Second,
give Ajin the right to citizenship.

04:26.475 --> 04:29.519
Forget it! We can't do that!

04:29.603 --> 04:30.687
Correct.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.148
So, you need to somehow stop Sato
before he manages

04:33.231 --> 04:35.525
to assassinate the minister.

04:37.027 --> 04:40.155
This is truly your last chance, sir.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.578
Whatever the case may be,

04:46.953 --> 04:50.874
using human lives as shields
and making demands such as these

04:50.957 --> 04:55.587
is the height of depravity,
and we are disgusted by this.

04:55.670 --> 04:59.591
Does this mean you don't plan
to give in to Sato's demands?

04:59.674 --> 05:05.263
Not only have we never experimented
on Ajins as they claimed,

05:05.722 --> 05:08.975
the government does not give in
to terrorism.

05:09.476 --> 05:14.773
<i>We will take whatever action is necessary</i>
<i>to ensure the fastest possible resolution.</i>

05:16.066 --> 05:19.319
<i>That was footage of a press conference</i>
<i>with the Chief Cabinet Secretary</i>

05:19.402 --> 05:21.112
<i>that was held two days ago.</i>

05:23.657 --> 05:27.035
<i>Since the Ajin Sato made</i>
<i>his second threat,</i>

05:27.118 --> 05:31.540
<i>an emergency headquarters has been</i>
<i>set up at the prime minister's residence,</i>

05:31.623 --> 05:34.000
<i>and all related agencies are working</i>
<i>to gather information.</i>

05:39.005 --> 05:42.008
<i>Ignore him.</i>
<i>The best defense is to act natural.</i>

05:42.551 --> 05:46.012
<i>Seventeen- and 18-year-olds all look</i>
<i>the same.</i>

05:46.221 --> 05:50.308
<i>All over Japan, I'm sure kids</i>
<i>that look like me are being told as much.</i>

05:51.643 --> 05:53.436
Hey, Nagai, let's go!

05:56.064 --> 05:58.567
<i>How stupid is this idiot?</i>

05:58.650 --> 05:59.985
Hey, got any tissue?

06:00.068 --> 06:02.904
<i>This is Sato and the other Ajin.</i>

06:03.488 --> 06:07.033
<i>If you come across any of them,</i>
<i>please contact the police immediately.</i>

06:07.117 --> 06:07.951
Wait...

06:09.411 --> 06:11.371
Hey, the kid that was over there...

06:12.289 --> 06:13.123
Get the phone.

06:13.665 --> 06:15.625
I think we should contact the police.

06:16.459 --> 06:20.463
FUJI SOBA NOODLES

06:22.924 --> 06:25.635
I'm glad we're on the road and all,
but what's the plan?

06:25.844 --> 06:27.387
Got any ideas?

06:36.980 --> 06:37.856
WHO ARE AJIN?

06:37.939 --> 06:38.940
Well?

06:40.400 --> 06:44.070
Actually... I'm getting sick of this.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.906
I wish I could have stayed
with the old lady.

06:49.826 --> 06:52.162
You can go ahead
and decide everything now.

06:52.537 --> 06:54.122
In that case, let's go find Sato!

06:57.459 --> 06:58.668
Are you stupid?

07:04.132 --> 07:07.677
Listen to me, there is no way
we can beat him now.

07:07.761 --> 07:12.724
Besides, even if we did know where he was,
what could a couple of kids like us do?

07:12.807 --> 07:15.894
How would we actually stop him?
Put him in a cage?

07:16.394 --> 07:17.479
And then what?

07:18.647 --> 07:20.774
So there isn't anything we can do?

07:20.857 --> 07:22.025
No, not a whole lot.

07:22.525 --> 07:25.695
The way I see it,
we only have two advantages.

07:25.779 --> 07:30.867
The first is, I am smarter
than your average adult.

07:32.535 --> 07:35.997
We don't have tranquilizer guns
or a place to imprison Ajins,

07:36.081 --> 07:37.624
but we can improvise.

07:37.874 --> 07:41.795
Remember when I told you that there are
other ways to neutralize people forever?

07:43.129 --> 07:45.256
-You did?
-I did!

07:47.425 --> 07:48.551
<i>For example,</i>

07:48.635 --> 07:52.055
<i>there were ruins of an old well</i>
<i>deep in the mountains near the village.</i>

07:52.555 --> 07:55.809
<i>Note that there's no air in the shaft.</i>

07:56.685 --> 08:01.481
That's because the bacteria found
in that soil consumes all of the oxygen.

08:01.564 --> 08:05.819
If a person enters a place without oxygen,
they immediately lose consciousness.

08:07.278 --> 08:08.947
For an Ajin, it's an endless loop.

08:13.868 --> 08:15.120
Our second advantage is,

08:15.203 --> 08:18.915
we already have the most important skill
there is for fighting.

08:21.167 --> 08:24.170
If you could have a battle advantage,
which of these would you choose?

08:24.254 --> 08:26.381
One, physical strength.

08:26.464 --> 08:28.717
Two, a strategic mind.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.885
Three, immortality.

08:30.969 --> 08:32.262
Physical strength!

08:32.345 --> 08:33.471
That's right.

08:33.555 --> 08:35.640
Everyone would choose immortality.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.770
If we use these,
we should be able to fight back.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.480
Yeah, but--

08:42.564 --> 08:46.776
But Sato has us beat in terms
of numbers, supplies and experience.

08:47.110 --> 08:49.195
You want to fight him alone?

08:50.488 --> 08:51.406
That's funny.

08:53.950 --> 08:57.954
So, what is it we should be doing now?

08:59.956 --> 09:01.166
Working out?

09:02.417 --> 09:03.793
Finding allies.

09:04.502 --> 09:08.548
What we need are adults
who can provide powerful support.

09:13.845 --> 09:15.221
What are you doing now?!

09:15.305 --> 09:17.474
Allies, right? I've got an idea!

09:17.557 --> 09:20.060
-Explain it first!
-Just leave it to me!

09:25.231 --> 09:26.232
CHECKING SERVERS

09:26.316 --> 09:27.650
YOU HAVE NO NEW MESSAGES

09:27.734 --> 09:29.903
Damn it. Still nothing.

09:45.126 --> 09:48.379
They're gone.
But he said he'd keep them locked up.

09:49.422 --> 09:52.717
You idiot. There's no way
he'd leave them in the same place.

09:52.801 --> 09:55.011
-Don't call me an idiot!
-Well, you are an idiot!

09:55.095 --> 09:58.473
In addition to traveling long distance,
you took us to where Sato used to be.

09:58.556 --> 09:59.390
This is risky!

09:59.474 --> 10:01.101
Does it even matter?!

10:07.357 --> 10:09.901
YOU HAVE ONE NEW MESSAGE

10:09.984 --> 10:12.570
Thank God. Finally.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.740
What's that e-mail?

10:16.199 --> 10:17.951
Before they found me,

10:18.034 --> 10:21.204
I ordered a background check
on the Ajin Control Commission.

10:21.538 --> 10:22.747
This is it.

10:26.251 --> 10:30.171
One of them is a pretty interesting guy.

10:30.255 --> 10:32.382
BACKGROUND REPORT

10:32.465 --> 10:33.633
That guy...

10:39.848 --> 10:42.058
We've expanded the search
to other prefectures,

10:42.600 --> 10:46.479
including Kanagawa, Chiba and Saitama,

10:46.938 --> 10:49.315
but we've found no leads
regarding Sato's whereabouts.

10:50.066 --> 10:53.736
As for countermeasures, we plan
to capture him when he comes to attack.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.823
Dr. Wakai is the first person
on his hit list.

10:57.198 --> 11:01.452
I've told the police to treat this as
if they were protecting a head of state.

11:01.536 --> 11:04.247
I'm sure you understand, Tosaki.

11:06.166 --> 11:11.629
If I were to be killed, that would be
the end of your worthless life as well.

11:13.923 --> 11:14.674
Yes, sir.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.886
NAME: YUU TOSAKI

11:21.180 --> 11:24.309
This is good stuff, Nakano.
Very interesting.

11:25.018 --> 11:29.314
His fiancée is in a coma, and he's footing
the medical bills himself.

11:30.982 --> 11:33.860
And it's not an amount
he can easily pay off.

11:35.737 --> 11:41.117
<i>He's got a reason to stop Sato</i>
<i>and protect his own position.</i>

11:44.245 --> 11:47.665
Most importantly,
his lover is his weakness.

11:48.499 --> 11:49.751
We can use that.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.795
How is this fun for you?

11:59.093 --> 12:00.094
Mr. Tosaki.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.515
It's almost time for the council meeting.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.438
Those damn Ajin...

12:18.363 --> 12:19.989
<i>Yuu...</i>

12:20.615 --> 12:22.116
Hey, Yuu.

12:24.160 --> 12:27.080
-Won't you quit smoking?
-Not that again.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.373
I know.

12:28.915 --> 12:32.251
But I want us to be together
for as long as possible.

12:37.674 --> 12:41.219
No matter what happens,
there has to be a chance.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.100
Let's go, Shimomura.

12:52.689 --> 12:54.524
INCOMING CALL
UNKNOWN CALLER

12:58.403 --> 12:59.737
<i>Turn on the TV.</i>

13:00.113 --> 13:02.407
Who is this? How did you get this number?

13:02.490 --> 13:04.867
<i>Just turn on the TV. Now.</i>

13:08.246 --> 13:13.084
<i>The high-speed pursuit between the police</i>
<i>and a stolen vehicle continues.</i>

13:13.167 --> 13:16.170
<i>We've been told that the fugitive Ajin,</i>
<i>Kei Nagai, is aboard...</i>

13:16.254 --> 13:18.006
-Kei Nagai?!
-<i>That's right.</i>

13:18.464 --> 13:21.551
<i>And you should be able to guess</i>
<i>where we're going!</i>

13:24.178 --> 13:26.639
Damn it! The battery died!

13:27.390 --> 13:31.477
<i>Police have already warned locals,</i>
<i>asking them to remain indoors.</i>

13:31.561 --> 13:33.104
That street...

13:33.187 --> 13:35.606
<i>They are moving to apprehend the Ajin</i>
<i>and his accomplice.</i>

13:35.690 --> 13:37.734
That bastard...

13:39.027 --> 13:42.363
TOUTO UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

13:57.378 --> 14:01.007
You've got your earpieces and fake IDs?
I'm going in through the rear.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.175
Copy that.

14:02.258 --> 14:04.886
The suspects have entered the hospital.
We'll make the arrest.

14:04.969 --> 14:07.472
We'll go in from the front and the back!

14:09.140 --> 14:10.349
What--?

14:11.642 --> 14:12.685
Who are you?

14:14.562 --> 14:17.774
-Excuse me, sir!
-All of you wait outside. We're going in.

14:21.778 --> 14:24.113
What the hell, Nagai?! What's your plan?!

14:24.197 --> 14:26.824
-I'll explain later! You hide!
-Where?!

14:26.908 --> 14:31.704
I don't care! Just use your ghost to stop
his men when they come to capture me!

14:31.788 --> 14:35.416
Ghost? You mean, those black monsters?!
I can't make those things!

14:35.958 --> 14:38.294
-That isn't funny.
-I'm serious!

14:38.378 --> 14:40.963
The first time I saw one,
it totally freaked me out!

14:41.047 --> 14:43.633
Whatever, just hide.
This'll be harder if you're around!

14:47.887 --> 14:50.390
-Let's go.
-What do you think he's after?

14:50.473 --> 14:51.849
Maybe it's revenge.

14:52.683 --> 14:55.561
Or maybe Nagai is involved with Sato.

14:55.645 --> 14:56.771
Isn't this dangerous?

14:58.106 --> 14:59.440
What is your job?

15:00.400 --> 15:01.901
My job is to...

15:03.319 --> 15:04.862
It's to protect you.

15:07.407 --> 15:10.243
If I die, there's no future
for you either.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.080
So fight, for your own sake.

15:16.874 --> 15:19.419
There's a solemn atmosphere
hanging over the scene!

15:20.044 --> 15:23.506
The police have surrounded the building
and started evacuating,

15:23.589 --> 15:25.842
possibly out of fear
that this is Ajin terrorism!

15:37.437 --> 15:42.191
I never wanted to see your face again,
Mr. Tosaki.

15:42.775 --> 15:46.696
Too bad, because you and I will be seeing
each other every day from now on,

15:46.779 --> 15:48.156
right through the glass.

15:48.239 --> 15:49.782
I want to talk.

15:49.866 --> 15:51.367
Let's keep this civil.

15:51.451 --> 15:54.829
Then why don't we go outside?
It's a beautiful day.

15:55.580 --> 16:01.502
You try anything and I'll summon my ghost.
It will attack without orders.

16:01.586 --> 16:05.089
Even if you knock me out,
that won't stop it from doing damage.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.094
<i>It probably won't end well for you.</i>

16:11.220 --> 16:12.388
And especially...

16:13.473 --> 16:16.017
not for this woman right here.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.437
I swear... I'll kill you.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.573
Wait! Don't shoot!!

16:30.656 --> 16:33.951
-Nagai! You don't have to do this!
-Stay out of it, Nakano!

16:34.035 --> 16:35.411
Sir...? Do we shoot?!

16:35.495 --> 16:36.621
Kill me if you can!

16:41.250 --> 16:42.793
Don't shoot!

16:42.877 --> 16:44.253
Idiot!

16:45.046 --> 16:46.422
-Nagai!
-Kill her!

16:47.256 --> 16:48.341
Stop!

16:56.390 --> 16:59.143
I'm getting sick of this.

17:03.689 --> 17:04.857
That thing...

17:05.858 --> 17:08.402
always does the opposite
of what I command.

17:11.656 --> 17:12.865
What is it you want?

17:16.536 --> 17:17.453
It's summer.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.334
Sunlight would pour into the classroom.

17:24.585 --> 17:27.380
My sweaty hands would stick
to my notebook.

17:28.506 --> 17:32.885
<i>It was quiet and boring,</i>
<i>but it was civilized.</i>

17:37.807 --> 17:40.434
You never wanted it this way either,
did you?

17:40.851 --> 17:43.062
No. And it's all your fault.

17:43.271 --> 17:48.651
Wrong! It's not my fault this happened.
And it's not your fault either.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.695
We're the same.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.534
I came here to make a deal with you.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.828
As if I could trust an Ajin!

17:59.078 --> 18:02.456
I don't really understand what's going on,
but I do know one thing.

18:02.540 --> 18:05.793
We plan to take down Sato,
no matter what it takes!

18:06.043 --> 18:08.796
For her sake as well. So, if you arrest--

18:08.879 --> 18:11.966
So, listen, we'll be your pawns!

18:12.383 --> 18:14.135
Your immortal soldiers!

18:14.927 --> 18:16.345
That's right! So...

18:24.228 --> 18:25.271
What's the situation?

18:26.063 --> 18:28.983
The suspects have been arrested.
We'll take care of the rest.

18:30.526 --> 18:33.696
By the way, was it really Kei Nagai?

18:35.114 --> 18:38.284
No, it was someone else.
Just looked like him.

18:47.335 --> 18:49.211
SEPTEMBER 3RD

18:49.295 --> 18:52.715
Summer vacation was over.

19:01.891 --> 19:05.561
MESSAGE FROM SATO

19:06.520 --> 19:08.064
Oh, it's starting.

19:10.066 --> 19:13.861
Hello. We meet once again. It's Sato.

19:17.490 --> 19:22.745
As far as I know, the government has
not yet responded to my demands.

19:23.621 --> 19:26.082
So... I decided to get started.

19:31.504 --> 19:35.257
That's right, with the top
of the batting order, Dr. Wakai.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.806
And this is...

19:49.605 --> 19:51.857
the beginning of the countdown.

19:53.275 --> 19:58.322
<i>When the second wave finishes,</i>
<i>we'll move on to the third wave.</i>

20:00.908 --> 20:04.662
<i>The third... is the final wave.</i>

20:07.415 --> 20:09.750
I am going to take over this country.

20:11.168 --> 20:13.045
You think it's just some corny dream?

20:15.256 --> 20:16.298
I will do it.

20:17.925 --> 20:18.843
Count on it.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.265
TO BE CONTINUED

20:25.349 --> 20:28.436
<i>I'm tired of this one already, so</i>

20:28.519 --> 20:31.772
<i>I'll trade it</i>

20:31.856 --> 20:37.027
<i>For your ordinary one</i>

20:38.195 --> 20:44.452
<i>A shiny holy card</i>

20:44.577 --> 20:50.166
<i>For a grainy paper card</i>

20:50.916 --> 20:55.045
<i>You can see them all</i>

20:57.339 --> 21:01.761
<i>When you come to my house</i>

21:01.844 --> 21:07.892
<i>So</i>
<i>Two of us in the corner of the schoolyard</i>

21:07.975 --> 21:10.102
<i>While the wind blows</i>

21:10.186 --> 21:14.440
<i>I might be able to say it now</i>

21:16.567 --> 21:22.823
<i>Words I've never said to anyone</i>

21:22.907 --> 21:29.205
<i>"Won't you come and play, I'll be nice"</i>

21:29.288 --> 21:35.169
<i>"I'll give you anything, see"</i>

21:35.753 --> 21:38.464
<i>"Be my friend</i>

21:38.547 --> 21:45.346
<i>Always"</i>
