01:22.382 --> 01:23.552
Okay.

01:23.551 --> 01:24.751
Let's do this.

02:03.490 --> 02:04.560
Oh.

02:13.266 --> 02:14.866
We have a winner.

02:22.442 --> 02:24.142
( cell phone ringing )

02:28.581 --> 02:30.451
<i> Monica, it's prom!</i>

02:30.451 --> 02:32.181
How can you
still be in bed?

02:32.186 --> 02:34.746
I know, I was up till 2:30
doing my hair poll.

02:34.755 --> 02:36.355
Which style won?

02:36.357 --> 02:37.587
<i> The side-do.</i>

02:37.591 --> 02:39.161
I knew it!

02:40.360 --> 02:42.630
All is right
with my universe.

02:42.630 --> 02:45.660
I'm tracking way ahead
in the prom queen election.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.766
<i> And everything's set.</i>

02:47.768 --> 02:49.798
<i> Date. Dress. Shoes.</i>

02:49.803 --> 02:52.843
And as of last night, hair.

02:53.940 --> 02:55.270
<i> What? What is it?</i>

02:59.279 --> 03:01.349
How did this happen?

03:01.348 --> 03:03.348
It was fine
when I went to bed!

03:03.350 --> 03:04.620
It's like...

03:04.618 --> 03:06.688
all crispy.

03:06.687 --> 03:10.217
<i> Okay. Bacon-crispy?</i>
<i> Or dried-leaf-crispy?</i>

03:12.559 --> 03:13.829
I just broke it.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.557
I just broke off
a piece of my hair.

03:15.563 --> 03:16.863
<i> So, bacon-crispy.</i>

03:16.864 --> 03:17.934
Hold on.

03:19.332 --> 03:21.402
Do not add heat or curl.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.202
Do not mix
with other products.

03:23.204 --> 03:24.574
Do not leave
on overnight.

03:24.572 --> 03:26.272
I did
all of these things!

03:26.273 --> 03:29.243
<i> Okay. How many products</i>
<i> did you use?</i>

03:29.243 --> 03:31.213
The site was getting
all this traffic,

03:31.212 --> 03:33.412
so I just kept
trying new styles.

03:38.952 --> 03:41.592
My dress, my dress,
my dress,

03:41.589 --> 03:43.719
with the one that got the most
votes ever last week...

03:43.724 --> 03:45.824
The one that was like,
plastic?

03:45.826 --> 03:48.626
It's like melted.

03:51.864 --> 03:53.474
What the...?

03:56.569 --> 03:58.539
Everyone voted
for the little ones.

03:58.539 --> 04:02.509
So I put them in these
shoe expander things.

04:02.509 --> 04:04.279
<i> Think, Monica, think.</i>

04:04.278 --> 04:05.778
<i> These are just</i>
<i> material objects.</i>

04:05.779 --> 04:07.479
They can be repaired.

04:07.481 --> 04:08.811
I just need to do
a little bit of research.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.776
Okay.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.624
What? No!

04:12.620 --> 04:13.690
This is impossible.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.247
<i> What? What now?</i>

04:15.256 --> 04:17.286
The prom queen election
tracking software I made,

04:17.291 --> 04:19.630
I'm now in a dead heat
with Ashley Mendlebach.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.656
<i> SIERRA: If she wins,</i>
<i> evil will triumph.</i>

04:23.263 --> 04:26.433
<i> Our school will be plunged</i>
<i> into eternal darkness.</i>

04:26.433 --> 04:28.933
This day cannot
possibly get worse.

04:28.936 --> 04:29.836
( cell phone ringing )

04:29.837 --> 04:30.997
Stay on the line.

04:32.905 --> 04:33.765
Hello?

04:33.774 --> 04:35.944
Hello. Monica Reeves?

04:35.943 --> 04:37.613
<i> Speaking...?</i>

04:37.611 --> 04:39.651
This is the Department
of Motor Vehicles

04:39.647 --> 04:41.947
calling to schedule
your driver's test.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.779
Yes! Finally!

04:43.784 --> 04:46.894
Our first available
is April 11th...

04:46.887 --> 04:48.647
That was 2 weeks ago.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.056
Of next year.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.287
Next year?

04:51.292 --> 04:52.792
Are you kidding me?

04:52.793 --> 04:54.663
Budget cuts.

04:54.662 --> 04:58.432
Well, but...I'll be
in college next year.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.372
I have to get my license
this summer!

05:00.367 --> 05:01.867
Don't you have
anything sooner?

05:01.869 --> 05:03.739
<i> I have 2 p.m. today.</i>

05:03.737 --> 05:05.437
<i> Can you do 2 p.m. today?</i>

05:05.439 --> 05:06.809
'Cause nobody else can.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.007
Apparently, it's prom
or something.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.379
No. Not today.

05:10.377 --> 05:11.507
I can't do today.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.012
Next year it is then.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.813
Fine. I'll take today.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.415
Just show up 10 minutes

05:16.417 --> 05:18.417
before your
scheduled appointment.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.649
Bye-bye.

05:21.521 --> 05:24.791
<i> Yeah. Now I have to take</i>
<i> my driver's test today too.</i>

05:24.792 --> 05:26.562
<i> I have to figure</i>
<i> all this out.</i>

05:26.560 --> 05:28.330
- <i> I'll call you back. </i>
- 'K bye.

05:28.329 --> 05:30.859
What do you mean, you can't?
You're my boyfriend.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.904
And this constitutes
emergency boyfriend duty.

05:32.900 --> 05:35.500
<i> I just need a ride!</i>
<i> The salon,</i>

05:35.502 --> 05:36.902
<i> some shops,</i>
<i> the DMV...</i>

05:36.904 --> 05:38.674
I'm volunteering
at the group home

05:38.672 --> 05:40.712
and the orphans, babe,

05:40.708 --> 05:41.868
they count on me.

05:41.875 --> 05:44.375
So just call a taxi.

05:44.378 --> 05:46.608
<i> But that would cost like $200.</i>

05:46.613 --> 05:48.753
I barely have enough to cover
my salon appointment.

05:48.749 --> 05:49.749
You'll figure it out.

05:49.750 --> 05:50.880
You always do.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.754
I'll see you tonight,
okay?

05:52.753 --> 05:54.023
I'm super-stoked.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.551
Me too.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.356
Stoked...

05:57.358 --> 05:58.918
super-ly.

06:06.499 --> 06:08.399
Morning, honey.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.642
Look,
I'm a tech nerd too.

06:10.637 --> 06:11.937
I finally
figured out

06:11.939 --> 06:14.569
that picture posting stuff
you do.

06:14.575 --> 06:17.075
I put up a shot of me
at the hospital.

06:17.077 --> 06:19.807
You can re-twit it
to all your peoples.

06:19.813 --> 06:20.983
Whoa!

06:22.582 --> 06:23.952
New hairstyle.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.521
Love it.

06:27.453 --> 06:29.763
Not intentional, Dad.

06:33.092 --> 06:35.462
My universe
has been destroyed.

06:35.462 --> 06:37.902
Everything I've set
for prom is ruined.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.558
My hair's crispy.

06:39.566 --> 06:40.766
My dress is melted.

06:40.768 --> 06:43.398
My shoes have exploded...

06:43.404 --> 06:44.674
Don't worry.

06:44.671 --> 06:45.971
We'll work something out.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.873
I'll call in sick.

06:47.875 --> 06:50.105
Wait, aren't you working
at the ER today?

06:50.110 --> 06:51.580
Yeah. So...

06:51.578 --> 06:53.108
You can't
call in sick.

06:53.113 --> 06:54.913
You're a nurse.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.575
People are counting
on you to be,

06:56.583 --> 06:58.923
you know, kept alive.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.749
I'll be okay.
You sure?

07:00.754 --> 07:03.594
Yeah! I'm sure.

07:07.059 --> 07:08.589
High five.

07:10.696 --> 07:12.896
I don't want to push you.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.970
But it is the week,

07:14.968 --> 07:17.598
so you have to make
a choice.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.874
I get why you're leaning
towards State.

07:19.873 --> 07:20.813
I went to State.

07:20.808 --> 07:21.938
It's a fine school.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.012
A fun school.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.210
But you've been given--

07:24.211 --> 07:26.181
A once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

07:26.180 --> 07:27.710
I know.

07:28.815 --> 07:31.175
Can we, maybe,
talk about this later?

07:31.185 --> 07:34.185
Yeah. If you need anything
today just call me up

07:34.188 --> 07:37.018
or, yo, text me up.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.894
Just text. No up.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.532
No up.

07:40.527 --> 07:41.587
No up.

07:44.063 --> 07:46.533
Dad, is this a bedpan?

07:46.533 --> 07:48.033
DAD: Pretty dope, huh?

08:21.133 --> 08:22.933
( cell phone ringing )

08:25.872 --> 08:28.272
It's hopeless.
I'm stranded here.

08:28.275 --> 08:30.975
Okay. I can try and pick you up
on my ten-speed.

08:30.978 --> 08:32.038
<i> Yeah.</i>

08:32.044 --> 08:33.804
<i> That's a terrible idea.</i>

08:33.813 --> 08:34.953
Yeah.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.948
Okay. What is that?

08:37.951 --> 08:39.681
<i> Oh.</i>

08:39.686 --> 08:42.586
This, I found it
in a pawn shop actually.

08:42.589 --> 08:43.719
13 bucks.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.794
Pretty awesome, eh?

08:45.792 --> 08:48.262
It's the one part of my outfit
that isn't ruined.

08:48.262 --> 08:50.862
<i> Did you ever have</i>
<i> people vote on it?</i>

08:52.798 --> 08:56.028
No. I actually
just really liked it.

08:57.236 --> 08:59.266
What?
Do you not like it?

08:59.273 --> 09:00.473
( doorbell ringing )

09:00.474 --> 09:01.974
Who's that?

09:03.109 --> 09:04.209
I don't know.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.211
I'll call you later.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.282
<i> Okay, bye.</i>

09:10.917 --> 09:13.017
( indistinct mumbling )

09:13.020 --> 09:14.050
Come on.

09:23.829 --> 09:25.029
Good morning.

09:27.567 --> 09:28.897
Good morning.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.872
I'm Officer
Liz McRogersburger.

09:30.871 --> 09:32.871
FBI, Special Criminal
Investigation Unit.

09:32.873 --> 09:33.943
Dayton County Bureau.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.911
Is this about
the Gottlieb twins

09:35.909 --> 09:37.709
blowing up the Abrahamians'
lawn gnome?

09:37.711 --> 09:39.841
Because I told Mrs. Abrahamian
I did not see anything.

09:39.846 --> 09:41.976
No, no, no, this has
nothing to do with Abraham

09:41.982 --> 09:44.222
or his decorative
gardenware, ma'am.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.917
I just need to ask you
a few questions

09:45.919 --> 09:48.589
and then I'll be
out of your...

09:48.589 --> 09:49.749
hair.

09:51.057 --> 09:52.117
Stay here.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.285
Well, I--

10:03.970 --> 10:05.240
You're with the FBI?

10:05.238 --> 10:06.338
That's right.

10:06.340 --> 10:08.010
The American FBI?

10:08.008 --> 10:09.308
Oh, I'm sorry.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.309
Is my Russian accent
throwing you off?

10:11.311 --> 10:13.981
Yes, yes, it would be
the American FBI.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.111
Can I please come in?

10:15.115 --> 10:16.175
Oh, do you
have a warrant?

10:16.183 --> 10:18.053
Not technically--

10:18.051 --> 10:19.121
Then no.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.349
Okay, wow.

10:21.355 --> 10:22.745
You're cautious.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.116
I respect that.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.224
Okay,
let's get to work.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.186
Tell me what you know
about this.

10:31.230 --> 10:33.900
Never seen it before.

10:35.735 --> 10:37.195
I'm gonna need you
to think harder.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.904
You see, it's a felony
to lie to a federal agent.

10:39.906 --> 10:41.866
Actually, it's not.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.935
It's only a crime to lie
under oath in a court of law.

10:44.945 --> 10:48.805
Lying to a federal officer?
Just impolite.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.945
Also, you're not
a federal officer.

10:50.951 --> 10:52.221
Yes, I am.
I'm with the FBI.

10:52.219 --> 10:53.819
Right.
What bureau again?

10:53.820 --> 10:55.690
Oh, Dayton County?
Dayton County, yes.

10:55.689 --> 10:58.189
Yeah, see, I'm
on the FBI website.
I see that.

10:58.191 --> 11:00.031
And there is no bureau
in Dayton County.

11:00.027 --> 11:01.387
There is, you're just
looking in the wrong place.

11:01.395 --> 11:02.955
Let me see
your badge again.

11:06.766 --> 11:08.896
Okay.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.372
Okay,
I'm not with the FBI.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.070
Cool, cool.

11:12.072 --> 11:14.772
So, would you like to
tell me who you really are,

11:14.775 --> 11:17.405
you know, before I call
the real authorities?

11:17.411 --> 11:18.841
'Cause, see...

11:18.845 --> 11:20.905
impersonating
a federal officer?

11:20.914 --> 11:23.384
That is a felony.

11:23.383 --> 11:24.923
Okay, here's the deal.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.918
I'm a private investigator.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.250
who would like
to remain anonymous.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.016
They're looking
for this necklace.

11:31.024 --> 11:34.034
And they're willing to pay
a considerable reward.

11:36.896 --> 11:38.056
Is that your car?

11:39.965 --> 11:41.925
Yeah.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.195
Pretty sweet, eh?

11:44.203 --> 11:45.843
Sweet. Sure.

11:47.273 --> 11:48.743
Come in.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.142
What, now you are
letting me in?

11:50.143 --> 11:51.913
You're like 5'1".
What could you possible do?

11:51.912 --> 11:52.942
Hey, I'm five--

11:52.946 --> 11:54.746
Okay, you know what,

11:54.748 --> 11:56.408
let's not squabble
over little details, okay?

11:56.416 --> 11:58.416
Little, indeed.

11:58.418 --> 12:00.318
You're one to talk.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.990
That extra inch you've got
on me is really intimidating.

12:04.924 --> 12:08.194
No one cuts a hedge
like you, Mr. Nedermeyer.

12:13.833 --> 12:15.873
You know, you should upgrade
your alarm system.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.969
Yeah, you can neutralize
that particular console

12:17.971 --> 12:20.041
with a pipe cleaner
and a cell phone.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.440
Let's hope
we're not robbed

12:21.441 --> 12:23.941
by any third graders
coming from arts and crafts.

12:29.281 --> 12:30.981
Lovely home.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.084
Rugged.

12:33.385 --> 12:35.315
Good use of brown.

12:35.322 --> 12:36.492
My Dad picked it.

12:36.490 --> 12:37.520
You want something
to drink?

12:37.524 --> 12:40.164
Yeah, water.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.130
Tap.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.799
No ice.

12:47.032 --> 12:48.472
So...

12:49.902 --> 12:52.802
this necklace
it's valuable?

12:52.806 --> 12:53.906
No. No.

12:53.907 --> 12:55.507
It's just
costume jewelry.

12:55.509 --> 12:56.879
But it has
sentimental value.

12:56.877 --> 12:57.977
Ah, okay.
Yeah.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.278
When was the last time
you saw it?

12:59.279 --> 13:01.909
What makes you think
I've seen it?

13:01.915 --> 13:03.045
I've been at this game
a long time.

13:03.049 --> 13:04.449
What game?

13:04.451 --> 13:05.781
The crime game.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.446
So this is about a crime?

13:07.454 --> 13:09.054
I didn't say that.

13:09.055 --> 13:09.915
You implied it.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.793
I don't think I did.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.192
Look, no offense,

13:13.193 --> 13:15.093
but if you really are
a private investigator,

13:15.095 --> 13:16.995
you're a pretty
terrible one.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.927
How long have I been
in your house?

13:18.932 --> 13:20.802
I don't know.

13:20.801 --> 13:23.231
Thirty seconds?
Thirty seconds.

13:23.236 --> 13:25.366
Thirty seconds and here's
what I've learned about you.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.112
Okay, you're
a high school senior.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.467
You're allergic to nickel.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.065
You're young
for your class.

13:30.076 --> 13:31.576
You're dating
a jock-politician

13:31.578 --> 13:33.108
who's popular
but soulless.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.983
You live alone with Dad,
no siblings,

13:34.981 --> 13:37.581
because Mom left,
when you were very young.

13:37.584 --> 13:38.984
How'd I do?

13:40.052 --> 13:41.922
How did you--?

13:41.922 --> 13:43.892
Your class ring
is from this year.

13:43.890 --> 13:46.060
It's pewter, not gold,
so, no nickel.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.059
And on the mantel
is your middle school diploma

13:48.061 --> 13:49.931
from 3 years ago,
so you skipped a year.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.560
And then
there on the fridge

13:51.565 --> 13:53.925
is this cute little picture
of you and Mr. Wonderful,

13:53.934 --> 13:55.474
eleven cause ribbons.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.068
Enough said.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.140
Now, onto the color brown.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.068
Color clearly chosen
by a man

14:00.073 --> 14:02.273
who had absolutely
no input from his wife.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.135
And since I can't see
a single picture

14:04.144 --> 14:05.544
of a mom anywhere,

14:05.545 --> 14:07.275
I'm guessing she left
a long time ago,

14:07.280 --> 14:09.080
and you guys
are not happy about it.

14:09.082 --> 14:11.482
The only thing
that I can't figure out

14:11.484 --> 14:15.124
is what the heck
is going on with your hair.

14:17.356 --> 14:20.186
Well, you're wrong
about my boyfriend.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.463
He's not soulless.
Oh, he's not.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.002
He helps orphans.
He helps orphans.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.127
He helps orphans.

14:25.131 --> 14:27.331
Oh, my gosh,
I didn't know that.

14:27.334 --> 14:28.974
He does.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.439
We can go back and forth
like this all day

14:30.437 --> 14:31.997
or you can give me
the necklace

14:32.005 --> 14:33.435
and I can arrange
for you to get a reward.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.340
Well, I don't
have the necklace.
Yes, you do.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.642
I know you got it at a pawn
shop couple of weeks ago.

14:37.644 --> 14:39.214
How could you
possibly know that?

14:39.212 --> 14:42.382
Because the owner showed me
the credit card record.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.382
Yeah.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.553
Uh-oh.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.651
He fell
for the FBI thing.

14:46.653 --> 14:49.053
All 5'1" of it.

14:51.323 --> 14:52.363
Wait here.

14:52.359 --> 14:53.559
Mm-hmm.

15:05.371 --> 15:07.241
Eleven cause ribbons.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.970
I don't think so.

15:10.409 --> 15:11.939
Mmm.

15:11.945 --> 15:13.175
Dippy eggs.

15:18.017 --> 15:19.177
Oh.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.089
Is everything okay?

15:25.091 --> 15:26.931
No, no. It's good.
It's good.

15:26.927 --> 15:28.227
It's just that you know,
I really am-- I'm just--

15:28.228 --> 15:29.928
I'm just--

15:29.930 --> 15:33.030
This brown is really,
it's really growing on me.

15:43.208 --> 15:44.708
Here's the deal.

15:44.711 --> 15:47.081
I know
where your necklace is.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.210
But I don't want a reward,
I want a ride.

15:49.215 --> 15:51.215
What?
Today's my prom.

15:51.217 --> 15:54.947
I've suffered some
logistical setbacks.

15:54.955 --> 15:56.715
I need four things.
Hair, dress, shoes,

15:56.723 --> 15:58.563
and I have to take
my driver's test today.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.118
Today?
Long story.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.956
I'll get you
your necklace.

16:01.962 --> 16:04.162
But you need to drive me
to these places first.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.364
No, no--
It'll only be
a few hours.

16:06.366 --> 16:08.626
And then we both get
what we want.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.365
Fine.

16:10.370 --> 16:13.170
You may want to put
a hat on that first.

16:41.300 --> 16:42.570
Hello?

16:44.636 --> 16:45.766
Hello!

16:48.307 --> 16:49.537
Hello!

16:59.051 --> 17:01.091
Forgive
the dramatic entrance,

17:01.087 --> 17:03.487
but I'm
in a bit of a rush.

17:05.023 --> 17:08.034
I'm looking
for a certain necklace.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.657
A ne--
a necklace?

17:16.502 --> 17:19.041
What is all this stuff?
Nothing.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.539
It doesn't
look like nothing.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.740
It looks like some
highly illegal

17:21.741 --> 17:24.540
aftermarket
surveillance gear.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.384
That's a high-frequency
radar jammer, right?

17:26.378 --> 17:29.079
That's like,
police-level.

17:29.082 --> 17:31.282
Though you may
want to tune to the KA band

17:31.284 --> 17:33.224
to decrease
frequency noise.

17:33.219 --> 17:35.189
You're pretty savvy
for someone

17:35.188 --> 17:36.518
who can't use
a curling iron.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.423
Is that a gun?
No, no.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.086
That is not--
That's not, okay.

17:41.094 --> 17:43.594
That is a non-lethal
high voltage

17:43.596 --> 17:45.556
stunning apparatus.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.095
Sweet.
No, it's not sweet.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.600
It is very unsweet,
okay?

17:48.601 --> 17:50.701
That thing can drop
an elephant at 25 feet.

17:50.703 --> 17:51.843
What's with
the red button?
Don't touch
the red button.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.368
But I want to touch
the red button.

17:53.373 --> 17:54.843
Haven't you seen
movies, okay?

17:54.841 --> 17:57.641
when someone touches
the red button.

17:59.178 --> 18:00.478
So...

18:01.413 --> 18:03.283
did this
bucket of bolts

18:03.283 --> 18:04.653
used to be
a cab or something?

18:04.651 --> 18:07.791
What?
Okay, so.

18:07.787 --> 18:11.087
Brando is a custom
super-charged in-line

18:11.091 --> 18:13.621
eight police-caliber
powerhouse, okay.

18:13.626 --> 18:14.756
He has
bulletproof glass.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.291
That's right.
That's right.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.626
Sixteen-channel
emergency-band radio

18:18.631 --> 18:20.831
and right there is built in
video surveillance panel,

18:20.834 --> 18:22.134
seat warmers.

18:22.135 --> 18:23.125
Ooh.

18:23.136 --> 18:24.796
"Brando?"

18:24.804 --> 18:26.344
Your car has a name.

18:26.339 --> 18:28.609
Yeah.
After Marlon Brando.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.578
The most famous actor
of our time, Marlon Brando.

18:30.577 --> 18:32.437
Nothing--
See,
that is amazing to me.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.305
I don't understand that.
I don't.

18:36.482 --> 18:37.822
Why can't
I get a signal?

18:37.817 --> 18:41.317
Because Brando,
he's got magnetic shielding,

18:41.321 --> 18:42.621
jams infrared.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.292
I can't get a signal
in this thing?

18:44.290 --> 18:45.820
No.

18:45.825 --> 18:48.625
But I've been, like,
offline for 6 minutes.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.258
Tonight's my prom

18:50.263 --> 18:52.433
and I'm running
for prom queen.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.202
Do you know how much
I've already missed?

18:54.200 --> 18:55.630
How many posts?
Status updates?

18:55.635 --> 18:56.765
Emails?
Good.

18:56.769 --> 18:58.699
I don't trust
that stuff.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.705
It's bad news, it's a way
for people to track you

19:00.707 --> 19:04.137
But I want people
to know where I am.

19:04.144 --> 19:06.884
Yeah, we actually
have apps for that.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.910
Pal Spotter.

19:08.915 --> 19:10.305
Pal Spotter.
Yeah.

19:10.316 --> 19:11.816
It lets people know
where everyone is,

19:11.818 --> 19:13.178
at every second.

19:13.186 --> 19:14.916
That is terrifying
to me, right.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.151
Okay, here's what you need,
here's what you need.

19:16.156 --> 19:17.586
You need one of these.
Okay.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.490
No one has any idea
where I am, all right?

19:19.492 --> 19:20.832
It doesn't even
hold contacts,

19:20.827 --> 19:21.857
I don't think.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.861
Built in 2002.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.663
Oh, no.
Water Polo Hotties.

19:25.665 --> 19:26.895
Hide.
"Water Polo Hotties"?

19:26.900 --> 19:27.930
Is it like a gang?

19:27.934 --> 19:29.934
What is it?

19:29.936 --> 19:31.936
They-- They don't look
very dangerous.

19:31.938 --> 19:33.438
They go to my school.

19:33.439 --> 19:35.339
I can't let them see me
in this freakmobile.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.911
I'm sorry,
freakmobile?

19:37.911 --> 19:39.911
Did you just-- You called
Brando a freakmobile.

19:39.913 --> 19:40.913
All right,
let's play that game.

19:40.914 --> 19:42.454
Wait, wait.
No, please.

19:42.448 --> 19:44.678
( music blaring )

19:44.684 --> 19:48.424
Hey, you with
the stupid glasses.

19:48.421 --> 19:49.751
Yeah, you.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.216
Turn your radio down.

19:51.224 --> 19:52.694
It's a nuisance.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.832
Municipal Code
5617-1B.

19:55.828 --> 19:57.728
What's your problem?

19:57.730 --> 19:58.860
Monica?

19:58.865 --> 20:00.495
Is that you?

20:00.500 --> 20:02.430
Hi, Braiden.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.195
Aiden.
Jasper.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.604
Toby.
Other Aiden.

20:06.606 --> 20:08.506
Congrats on your
win last night.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.608
That 3-3 offense is really
working for you guys.

20:10.610 --> 20:11.610
Thanks.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.211
See you.

20:13.213 --> 20:16.783
Turn the music down
please.

20:20.586 --> 20:21.986
( indistinct )

20:22.821 --> 20:24.421
( siren wailing )

20:24.424 --> 20:25.924
Wait.
You're a cop?

20:25.925 --> 20:28.655
You can get
one of these for $21.99.

20:30.562 --> 20:31.732
Pull over!

20:31.731 --> 20:33.801
Pull your
little mop art over!

20:33.800 --> 20:37.540
Take your energy-efficient
vehicle and stop it!

20:37.537 --> 20:38.697
There you go.

20:38.705 --> 20:39.835
What are you
doing?

20:39.839 --> 20:41.509
Don't get out
of the car.

20:41.507 --> 20:44.407
Sunglasses off now!

20:47.714 --> 20:51.954
I have a windshield cam,
it caught you littering

20:51.951 --> 20:54.891
on a public road.
Yeah.

20:54.887 --> 20:57.287
So see, I'm within my rights
to perform a citizen's arrest

20:57.290 --> 20:59.020
and have you turned over
to the authorities,

20:59.025 --> 21:02.785
yeah, which is a $500 fine
or two nights in jail.

21:02.795 --> 21:06.255
But guess since
you're such pretty boys,

21:06.266 --> 21:08.296
you don't want
to do that, right?

21:08.301 --> 21:10.271
So, pull back,

21:10.270 --> 21:12.600
pick up your drink

21:12.605 --> 21:14.765
and dispose of it
properly.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.314
Okay?

21:16.309 --> 21:18.409
Yes, ma'am.

21:18.411 --> 21:19.881
Ma'am.
That's right.

21:19.879 --> 21:20.979
Ma'am.

21:22.447 --> 21:23.907
Get some haircuts.

21:23.916 --> 21:25.046
All of you.

21:25.051 --> 21:26.651
You look ridiculous.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.718
Buckle up,
sweetpea.

21:31.790 --> 21:33.060
I can't believe
that just happened.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.489
That just happened.

21:39.331 --> 21:40.771
Sorry!

21:49.341 --> 21:50.881
MONICA: Do you have
any idea how many votes

21:50.877 --> 21:52.437
that probably
cost me?

21:52.445 --> 21:54.005
LIZ: Votes? What,
are you running for office?

21:54.013 --> 21:55.513
For prom queen.

21:55.515 --> 21:56.805
I had the election
locked up last night.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.446
And now
I'm falling behind.

21:58.451 --> 22:00.691
You have
real time polling data

22:00.687 --> 22:02.047
for prom queen
election?

22:02.055 --> 22:04.815
Yes.
That is why
you were cozying up

22:04.824 --> 22:06.864
to those
water polo delinquents.

22:06.859 --> 22:07.959
They aren't
delinquents!

22:07.960 --> 22:10.860
They are really sweet,
really hot guys

22:10.863 --> 22:12.363
who happen to be
slightly disrespectful

22:12.365 --> 22:13.925
of the city's
sanitation rules.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.933
And why do you care about
littering laws, anyway?

22:15.935 --> 22:17.025
I thought PI's were
supposed to be cool.

22:17.036 --> 22:18.396
Hey, Sarah.
I'm sure they are.

22:18.404 --> 22:19.974
Am, I am.
Look, why are we here?

22:19.972 --> 22:21.372
I have
a hair appointment,

22:21.374 --> 22:22.914
and I need to return
my dress.

22:22.909 --> 22:25.409
Girl! That color
looks great on you.

22:25.411 --> 22:26.881
I got your vote
tonight, right?

22:26.879 --> 22:28.909
Oh, you are really
desperate for votes.

22:28.915 --> 22:30.745
Listen, I care about
my community.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.880
And I happen to care about
what they think of me, okay?

22:32.885 --> 22:35.515
It sounds exhausting.
That's why I work alone.

22:35.521 --> 22:36.891
How's that going for you,
Miss Cheerful?

22:36.889 --> 22:39.819
Tommy, I saw the pics
from the sit-in.

22:39.826 --> 22:42.686
You know, I really hope
you guys save those wetlands.

22:42.695 --> 22:43.855
Yeah.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.833
Then you can get back
to your drum circle.

22:45.832 --> 22:47.702
Okay.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.800
PS, thanks for
the samurai work

22:49.802 --> 22:51.672
you did
on our website.

22:51.671 --> 22:54.871
I told you. It's all about
search engine optimization.

22:54.874 --> 22:56.944
Rad hat,
by the way.

22:56.943 --> 23:00.143
Ski hats, this year's berets.
You know what I'm saying?
Totally.

23:00.146 --> 23:01.806
So, I've got your vote
tonight, right?

23:01.814 --> 23:03.654
Hey,
you've got my vote.

23:03.649 --> 23:05.149
So who is this?

23:05.151 --> 23:06.851
Uh...

23:08.520 --> 23:10.960
she is my
Aunt Hilda.

23:10.957 --> 23:13.817
She's colorblind.

23:13.826 --> 23:15.526
Oh, no,

23:15.528 --> 23:16.828
I'm really sorry
to hear about that.

23:16.829 --> 23:18.959
I mean...
Yeah.

23:18.965 --> 23:20.895
It's sad.

23:20.900 --> 23:23.030
I sit at stoplights
all day wondering,

23:23.035 --> 23:24.135
"Do I stay?

23:24.137 --> 23:25.467
Do I go?"

23:25.471 --> 23:26.801
Okay.
Bye.

23:26.806 --> 23:28.506
Bye.
I'll see you tonight.

23:28.508 --> 23:29.808
Bye.

23:29.809 --> 23:30.979
Really?

23:30.977 --> 23:33.107
"Colorblind Aunt Hilda"?

23:33.112 --> 23:34.912
Would you prefer
"creepy private eye

23:34.914 --> 23:36.854
strangely obsessed with
a piece of costume jewelry"?

23:36.849 --> 23:39.119
Why colorblind?
And why Hilda?
I don't know.

23:39.118 --> 23:40.848
I don't even know
your real name.

23:40.853 --> 23:42.993
I somehow doubt
it's Liz McRogersberger.

23:42.989 --> 23:45.089
It is Liz, all right?

23:45.091 --> 23:46.421
Liz Morgan.

23:46.426 --> 23:47.926
Oh, hey,
Sierra's here.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.457
Who?
Where?

23:49.462 --> 23:51.962
Right there...
there.

23:51.964 --> 23:53.964
Oh, great.
There's another one of you.

23:53.966 --> 23:55.696
Hey!

23:55.701 --> 23:56.871
You're here!

23:56.869 --> 23:58.839
I thought you were
stuck at home.

23:58.838 --> 24:00.808
Well,
I got a ride.

24:00.807 --> 24:02.867
Oh. Hi.

24:02.875 --> 24:03.965
I'm Sierra.

24:03.976 --> 24:05.476
Who are you?
Who is she?

24:05.478 --> 24:06.908
I'm Hilda.
She's Liz.

24:06.913 --> 24:08.213
Long story.
What's up?

24:08.214 --> 24:10.924
Okay.
I am totally freaking out.

24:10.917 --> 24:12.817
I'm second guessing my colors
for tonight.

24:12.819 --> 24:14.889
Oh, I wish
I could help you.

24:14.887 --> 24:16.687
But I'm colorblind
so it ain't gonna happen.

24:16.689 --> 24:18.019
Stop it.
You started it.

24:18.024 --> 24:19.224
Okay, okay, okay.

24:19.225 --> 24:21.755
So did you hear
Steph and Zoey

24:21.761 --> 24:23.191
both got in
off the waitlist.

24:23.196 --> 24:26.556
We're all going to State.
Monica, you have to go.

24:26.566 --> 24:27.896
It's going to be
such a blast.

24:27.900 --> 24:30.700
I know, I know,
it's-- Oh, no.

24:30.703 --> 24:32.573
I'm gonna be late.

24:32.572 --> 24:34.672
Okay! Okay!

24:34.674 --> 24:37.014
Whoo!
What's all this about State?

24:37.009 --> 24:38.209
Ooh, I want to
go to State.

24:38.211 --> 24:39.911
State sounds great.

24:39.912 --> 24:41.812
I'm trying to decide
which college to go to.

24:41.814 --> 24:44.754
are going to go to State
next year.

24:44.750 --> 24:46.150
But I got into
one other place.
What's that?

24:46.152 --> 24:47.552
The University of
I Can't Do Hair?

24:47.553 --> 24:48.793
MIT.

24:50.188 --> 24:51.588
What?

24:53.058 --> 24:55.858
You got into the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology,

24:55.862 --> 24:58.062
and you're debating that
or State?

24:58.064 --> 25:00.504
How is that even a choice
in your head?

25:00.500 --> 25:03.070
Because everybody I know
is going to State, okay.

25:03.069 --> 25:04.969
At MIT, I would...

25:04.971 --> 25:07.071
I'd be a nobody.

25:07.073 --> 25:08.573
And that's a bad thing?

25:08.574 --> 25:09.914
Hi.
Uh, Monica Reeves.

25:09.909 --> 25:11.039
I have an 11:30.

25:11.977 --> 25:14.037
It's 11:33.

25:15.146 --> 25:17.576
Yeah,
I'm a smidge late.

25:17.583 --> 25:19.983
We gave your spot away.
What?

25:19.986 --> 25:22.616
Well, it's prom day.
There's no room for error.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.122
"There's no room
for error."

25:24.123 --> 25:25.193
Okay.
Please.

25:25.191 --> 25:26.891
I mean, I...
Look at this.

25:29.928 --> 25:31.898
You're speechless now,
aren't you?

25:31.898 --> 25:33.298
Be quiet.

25:33.299 --> 25:36.629
If something opens up,
I'll buzz you.

25:36.636 --> 25:40.296
Okay, that is ridiculous,
okay?

25:40.306 --> 25:42.266
It's hair, not
all-you-can-eat appetizers

25:42.275 --> 25:43.565
and cheesecake.

25:43.576 --> 25:45.206
Is this your mother?

25:45.211 --> 25:47.311
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.

25:47.313 --> 25:50.683
She's my Aunt Hilda.
She's colorblind.

25:50.683 --> 25:51.923
Well, tell her
to stop talking

25:51.918 --> 25:53.748
or we won't
take you at all.

25:53.753 --> 25:55.153
Hey, you know what?

25:55.154 --> 25:57.324
I'm colorblind, not deaf, right?
I can hear you.

25:57.323 --> 25:58.863
I just can't tell if that color
looks good on you.

25:58.858 --> 26:00.558
Bye-bye now.

26:00.560 --> 26:02.930
What is wrong with you?
What?
She started it.

26:02.929 --> 26:05.729
Have you never been
inside a salon before?

26:05.731 --> 26:07.161
You've never been
inside a salon before.

26:07.166 --> 26:08.296
Okay.

26:08.301 --> 26:09.971
Who cuts your hair?
I do.

26:09.969 --> 26:11.269
Figures.

26:11.270 --> 26:13.170
Oh, yeah.
You're one to judge.

26:32.691 --> 26:34.891
( beeping )

26:37.696 --> 26:39.756
Hello?

26:39.765 --> 26:41.025
Anyone here?

27:05.957 --> 27:07.927
( beeping rapidly )

27:11.930 --> 27:13.100
Which one's better?

27:13.099 --> 27:14.969
I don't know.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.697
They both block the sun,
right?

27:21.239 --> 27:24.809
Why did you just
take a picture of yourself?

27:24.810 --> 27:26.410
I'm polling my peeps.

27:26.412 --> 27:28.352
You're what-ing
your what?

27:28.347 --> 27:30.807
I, um--
I build these websites.

27:30.816 --> 27:33.116
Little online surveys,

27:33.119 --> 27:35.019
let people weigh
in on my decisions.

27:35.021 --> 27:39.021
Oh, 'cause heaven forbid,
you get the wrong sunglasses?

27:39.025 --> 27:40.815
Hey.
It's Marketing 101.

27:40.826 --> 27:42.786
I mean, these little choices
are important.

27:42.795 --> 27:44.995
People are either going to
accept you or reject you

27:44.997 --> 27:46.197
based on their
first impression.

27:46.198 --> 27:49.868
Or you could just
be yourself

27:49.869 --> 27:52.139
and not really care
what other people think?

27:53.872 --> 27:55.942
$540!

27:56.941 --> 27:58.841
$540.

27:58.844 --> 28:01.054
That's $540.

28:01.047 --> 28:03.947
Yeah. So?

28:03.949 --> 28:07.179
What? There's been a mistake.
There's been a mistake.

28:07.186 --> 28:10.086
I-I-It's two pieces of
plastic and a label.

28:11.923 --> 28:13.723
Here, try them on.
No, no, no.

28:13.726 --> 28:15.986
If I drop them, I'd have to
mortgage my house.

28:15.995 --> 28:18.725
Hey!

28:18.731 --> 28:20.331
Kinda hot.

28:21.266 --> 28:23.026
Oh...
Wow!

28:23.035 --> 28:24.965
That's what
you're paying for.

28:24.970 --> 28:28.010
I can almost see
in color again.

28:30.275 --> 28:32.005
Hey.
Can I help you two?

28:32.011 --> 28:33.041
Yes. Yes. Yes.

28:33.045 --> 28:36.175
I'm actually here
to return this

28:36.182 --> 28:39.222
little dress.

28:41.052 --> 28:42.452
Whoa!

28:42.455 --> 28:45.855
Monica, what did you do
to your dress?

28:45.858 --> 28:47.928
I'm guessing the same thing
you did to your hair.

28:47.927 --> 28:49.327
Nothing. Nothing.
Nothing.

28:49.328 --> 28:51.258
I-- I didn't--
I didn't do anything.

28:51.263 --> 28:52.463
It just...

28:52.465 --> 28:55.865
you know,
it spontaneously melted.

28:55.868 --> 28:57.898
It spontaneously melted?

28:57.903 --> 28:59.443
That's not even possible.
That can't happen.

28:59.438 --> 29:00.938
It doesn't matter.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.940
You have a no-questions
return policy, right?

29:02.942 --> 29:04.212
Did you put it
in a microwave?

29:04.210 --> 29:05.980
Did you put it
in the microwave?

29:05.978 --> 29:07.038
Because I don't think
we can take it back

29:07.046 --> 29:08.346
if you put it
in the microwave.

29:08.347 --> 29:10.277
I did not put it
in the microwave.

29:10.282 --> 29:12.022
Then what did you do to it?
What is this?
A police interrogation?

29:12.017 --> 29:13.077
I steamed it.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.015
With what?
A blowtorch?

29:15.020 --> 29:16.290
No.
With water...

29:16.288 --> 29:17.918
turned into steam...

29:17.923 --> 29:19.463
by a humidifier.

29:19.458 --> 29:22.028
You know with some of that
little eucalyptus vapor stuff.

29:22.027 --> 29:23.787
It was very stiff.

29:23.796 --> 29:26.896
Well, were you trying to
soften it or open its lungs?

29:26.899 --> 29:29.229
I'm sorry, but we can't
accept returns with

29:29.235 --> 29:30.465
customer damage.

29:30.469 --> 29:32.399
But I-I-I didn't damage it.

29:32.404 --> 29:33.404
I steamed it.

29:33.405 --> 29:34.865
No.
You vaporized it.

29:34.874 --> 29:36.214
Monica, come on.

29:36.208 --> 29:37.338
You vaporized
your prom dress.

29:37.343 --> 29:39.043
Hey!
Whose side are you on?

29:39.044 --> 29:40.784
It's not about
being on your side.

29:40.780 --> 29:42.980
( overlapping chatter )

29:42.982 --> 29:44.782
I'm sorry.
I just got to say.

29:44.784 --> 29:46.384
Well, it's really nice to see
mothers and daughters

29:46.385 --> 29:48.085
out shopping together.

29:48.087 --> 29:49.217
Oh, she's not my mother.
We're not related at all.

29:49.221 --> 29:50.251
Zero chance.

29:50.256 --> 29:51.316
( phone beeping )

29:52.457 --> 29:54.357
My hair appointment.
Okay.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.460
This, this is not over yet.
I'm coming back.

29:56.462 --> 29:57.962
And this lady?
She's crazy.

29:57.963 --> 29:59.303
I do not know her.

29:59.298 --> 30:00.458
I'm not really crazy.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.226
Hey, hey, hey,
why are you upset?

30:02.234 --> 30:04.134
You completely
just cost me my dress.

30:04.136 --> 30:05.936
Oh, I did that
to your dress?

30:05.938 --> 30:07.938
Yes!
Oh, did I also
do that to your hair?

30:07.940 --> 30:10.370
You know, how about taking
some personal responsibility?

30:10.376 --> 30:12.006
You want a new dress.

30:12.011 --> 30:13.311
You want something new,
you buy it.

30:13.312 --> 30:14.582
Oh.

30:14.580 --> 30:16.280
( security alarm blaring )

30:16.282 --> 30:17.882
Okay,
did you hear that?

30:17.883 --> 30:19.583
You hear that,
someone is being busted

30:19.585 --> 30:21.385
for shoplifting, okay.

30:21.387 --> 30:23.447
Someone wanted something,
and they didn't pay for it.

30:23.455 --> 30:24.815
What?

30:28.993 --> 30:30.063
Hello.

30:30.062 --> 30:31.932
Ma'am, please follow me.

30:31.931 --> 30:33.361
How's your personal
responsibility

30:33.365 --> 30:34.525
treating you now?

30:34.533 --> 30:35.973
Really?
Ma'am, please.

30:35.968 --> 30:36.968
Okay, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

30:36.969 --> 30:38.299
Seriously.

30:38.304 --> 30:39.844
Would a woman
who dresses like this,

30:39.839 --> 30:41.239
steal sunglasses
that look like that?

30:41.240 --> 30:45.110
Look, here's my
Police Retirement Association

30:45.110 --> 30:47.380
pension card, okay.
I'm a cop.

30:47.379 --> 30:49.479
At the moment kind of--
kind of a cop.

30:49.481 --> 30:51.951
You don't need
to know about that.

30:51.951 --> 30:54.121
All right, ma'am.
I'm gonna let you off
with a warning.

30:54.119 --> 30:55.989
But you need to be
more careful.

30:55.988 --> 30:57.448
Think hard about
the kind of example

30:57.456 --> 30:58.986
you're setting
for your daughter here.

30:58.991 --> 31:01.491
My daughter--
I'm not her daughter!

31:01.493 --> 31:03.463
We don't even look alike.
We don't even look
like each other.

31:03.462 --> 31:05.262
She has blue eyes,
I have brown eyes.

31:05.264 --> 31:06.304
It's just silly to me.
Can we just go now?

31:06.298 --> 31:08.128
Just go.
Yes. Thank you.

31:08.133 --> 31:10.003
Can you take those back for me?
Thanks, you're the best.

31:10.002 --> 31:11.472
You're great at your job.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.140
Is that true,
you're a cop?

31:13.138 --> 31:14.468
Yeah.

31:14.473 --> 31:17.373
I mean, no.
I'm on temporary sabbatical.

31:17.376 --> 31:19.036
Indefinitely.

31:19.044 --> 31:20.944
What happened?

31:20.946 --> 31:22.376
Let's just stick
to the mission, okay?

31:22.381 --> 31:23.951
What is an ex-cop doing

31:23.949 --> 31:25.349
looking for a piece
of costume jewelry?

31:25.351 --> 31:26.551
This is all getting
really weird.

31:26.552 --> 31:27.992
Then just give me
the diamond.

31:27.987 --> 31:29.047
The diamond?

31:29.054 --> 31:30.194
You mean the fake diamond?

31:30.189 --> 31:32.389
Yeah.
Exactly, the fake.

31:32.391 --> 31:33.961
Yes.

31:38.997 --> 31:40.127
Hello, friend.

31:40.132 --> 31:41.602
This is buzzing.

31:41.600 --> 31:44.300
No. It was buzzing.
But now it's stopped.

31:44.303 --> 31:45.603
We gave up your spot.

31:45.604 --> 31:47.544
What? No!

31:47.539 --> 31:50.039
I literally came
as fast as I could.

31:51.509 --> 31:54.609
But now you have to wait
until this one buzzes.

31:58.283 --> 31:59.623
I need a corn dog.

32:00.952 --> 32:03.252
See what you did?
See there?

32:03.255 --> 32:04.615
I don't like
that color either.

32:04.623 --> 32:06.093
Just be quiet.

32:06.091 --> 32:07.361
Listen.

32:07.359 --> 32:09.629
No. No talking.

32:09.628 --> 32:12.258
I'm going to sit there
and eat these corn dogs

32:12.264 --> 32:14.064
and wait
for that buzzer to buzz.

32:14.066 --> 32:15.396
But if you would just--

32:15.401 --> 32:17.131
And you are not going
to speak or distract me

32:17.136 --> 32:20.996
in any way or complicate
the situation, understood?

32:21.006 --> 32:22.566
Understood?

32:22.574 --> 32:25.114
Got it.

32:27.011 --> 32:28.451
You need a moment...

32:29.514 --> 32:31.154
and a corn dog.

32:37.088 --> 32:38.118
Uh-uh.

32:38.123 --> 32:39.993
No, no, no.

32:40.725 --> 32:43.225
Uh-uh.

32:43.228 --> 32:45.128
Oh, she doesn't
like mustard.

32:45.130 --> 32:46.630
Note to self.

32:46.632 --> 32:48.972
( ringing )

32:48.968 --> 32:50.328
Oh, come on.

32:54.739 --> 32:57.039
Oh, snap.

32:57.042 --> 32:58.282
( cell phone ringing )

32:58.277 --> 32:59.607
Oh, that's disgusting.

33:00.712 --> 33:03.082
Hey, Dad.
<i> Hey, kiddo.</i>

33:03.082 --> 33:05.052
I just wanted
to check in on you.

33:05.050 --> 33:07.180
You're doing okay?
<i> Oh. I'm-I'm doing great.</i>

33:07.186 --> 33:09.686
<i> Just great.</i>

33:09.688 --> 33:11.988
I talked to Faraja
in radiology.

33:11.991 --> 33:13.421
Now they don't have prom
in her country,

33:13.425 --> 33:15.085
but she said she had
a couple of dresses

33:15.094 --> 33:16.734
she thought might work.

33:16.729 --> 33:20.529
And there's a big sale today
at Discount Warehouse of Shoes.

33:20.532 --> 33:22.172
Thanks, Dad.

33:22.167 --> 33:23.697
Those are...

33:24.635 --> 33:25.695
good options.

33:25.704 --> 33:28.114
Great.
I'll be home by 6:00.

33:28.107 --> 33:29.707
Okay, Dad.
I love you.

33:29.708 --> 33:31.678
Love you too.
Tons, yo.

33:31.677 --> 33:32.677
Yeah, no yo.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.378
Yeah, just bye.

33:38.049 --> 33:39.479
Discount Warehouse of Shoes?

33:39.485 --> 33:40.615
Oh, I love that place.

33:40.619 --> 33:41.789
No talking.

33:49.327 --> 33:50.687
I have a question.

33:50.696 --> 33:52.296
Oh, my goodness.

33:52.297 --> 33:55.527
One question.
It's one, little.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.674
Go ahead.

33:57.669 --> 34:02.409
You know your boyfriend,
the soulless jerk

34:02.408 --> 34:05.538
with the bedazzled
letterman's jacket?

34:05.544 --> 34:07.044
He's not soulless.

34:07.046 --> 34:09.606
Right. He's full of soul.
I forgot.

34:09.614 --> 34:14.114
Okay, so let's say
hypothetically,

34:14.119 --> 34:16.819
um, I saw him

34:16.822 --> 34:23.192
flirting with another girl,
at say, I don't know,

34:23.195 --> 34:25.525
a mall food court,

34:25.531 --> 34:28.301
would you want me
to tell you?

34:29.534 --> 34:30.734
What?

34:35.373 --> 34:37.842
He's supposed
to be helping orphans.

34:39.110 --> 34:40.409
Does that girl have parents?

34:40.411 --> 34:42.552
Yes!

34:42.547 --> 34:44.478
Then he's not
doing that.

34:49.554 --> 34:50.554
Kyle?

34:50.556 --> 34:52.286
Oh. Monica.

34:52.291 --> 34:53.561
Hey.

34:53.559 --> 34:54.559
What are you doing here?

34:54.560 --> 34:55.630
Uh.

34:55.627 --> 34:57.187
The orphans canceled.

34:57.196 --> 34:58.696
Really?

34:58.697 --> 35:00.627
The orphans canceled.

35:00.632 --> 35:01.772
Yeah.
They were just...

35:01.767 --> 35:03.097
They were...

35:03.102 --> 35:04.532
They were totally
booked up today...

35:04.536 --> 35:07.296
very busy
doing orphan stuff.

35:07.306 --> 35:08.666
Hi, Monica.

35:08.674 --> 35:11.584
Nice hat.

35:11.577 --> 35:14.737
Are you competing
in a slalom later?

35:15.847 --> 35:17.807
Or maybe going for a luge?

35:21.252 --> 35:24.752
Kyle, how could you
with her?

35:24.756 --> 35:26.856
No, this--
this isn't what it looks like.

35:26.859 --> 35:29.129
Okay, 'cause it looks like
my supposed boyfriend

35:29.128 --> 35:30.788
is having a date
with my arch rival.

35:30.796 --> 35:34.456
Okay. That might technically
be somewhat accurate.

35:34.466 --> 35:38.836
I am so sorry, Monica.

35:38.837 --> 35:41.867
I know this must be
really hard.

35:41.874 --> 35:47.384
I mean, first
I steal your man.

35:47.379 --> 35:50.849
And then, tonight,

35:50.849 --> 35:52.679
I rob you of the prom crown.

35:52.684 --> 35:53.884
ALL: Ooh.

35:57.922 --> 35:59.492
I...

35:59.491 --> 36:00.921
I think
I'm going to be sick.

36:02.894 --> 36:05.234
That guy is
a classic vanity case.

36:05.230 --> 36:06.700
I told you.

36:06.698 --> 36:09.328
You know, he's probably
got an emotionally

36:09.334 --> 36:13.204
distant lawyer for a dad,
mom's, like an over-doter.

36:13.205 --> 36:15.435
He just goes
from girl to girl to girl.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.210
( Monica sobbing )

36:23.447 --> 36:24.777
Oh, wow.

36:27.952 --> 36:29.752
This has affected you.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.619
Okay.

36:35.927 --> 36:36.927
Oh, she's crying.

36:37.862 --> 36:39.332
( clears throat )

36:40.331 --> 36:41.331
Monica?

36:41.333 --> 36:43.273
What?

36:43.268 --> 36:44.398
Do you...

36:47.271 --> 36:48.771
need a corn dog?

36:50.575 --> 36:52.875
This is what happens
when you're not perfect.

36:52.878 --> 36:54.508
What?

36:55.947 --> 36:57.807
Is she here?

36:57.816 --> 36:59.946
I'm so glad
you're here.

36:59.952 --> 37:02.792
It's going to be okay.

37:02.788 --> 37:05.418
Don't worry.
No, it's okay.

37:05.424 --> 37:07.494
Should I--
Should I hug you?

37:08.759 --> 37:09.859
This is--

37:11.829 --> 37:12.929
Don't worry,
we're gonna fix this.

37:12.931 --> 37:15.271
It's just weird, okay.

37:15.267 --> 37:18.237
You know what, I'm just
gonna hug from afar.

37:19.604 --> 37:21.774
Okay, we're gonna put
you back together.

37:21.773 --> 37:22.773
Okay?
Okay.

37:25.610 --> 37:28.910
You know, you are a strong,
independent woman

37:28.914 --> 37:30.814
and he is a shallow dirt bag.

37:30.816 --> 37:32.646
Yeah, he's a dirt bag!

37:32.651 --> 37:34.481
It was humiliating.

37:34.486 --> 37:35.816
Everybody was watching.

37:35.821 --> 37:38.791
Yeah, well, they just saw
Ashley for the desperate

37:38.790 --> 37:40.860
back-stabber she is.

37:40.859 --> 37:44.889
He made a fool out of me
in front of all those people.

37:44.896 --> 37:47.696
Don't worry,
we're gonna fix this.

37:47.699 --> 37:49.399
Wait.
What is she doing now?

37:50.935 --> 37:52.935
Kyle Timmins, on your feet.

37:52.938 --> 37:55.438
What? Me?
Undercover mall security.
Stand up.

37:55.440 --> 37:56.870
All right,
hold on a second.

37:56.875 --> 37:59.835
Oh, you don't follow
directions very well, do you?

37:59.845 --> 38:01.845
Hey, Kyle, meet table.

38:01.847 --> 38:03.807
Table, this is Kyle.
Oh, no.

38:03.815 --> 38:06.375
Inappropriate
use of hair products,

38:06.385 --> 38:07.845
wearing jeans
that make you look silly,

38:07.853 --> 38:09.353
and we have
an insider tip

38:09.354 --> 38:10.694
that you may have
shoplifted

38:10.689 --> 38:13.689
hair loss products
and a man girdle.

38:13.692 --> 38:14.962
What?
That's crazy!

38:14.960 --> 38:16.890
I-I-I didn't
shoplift anything!

38:16.895 --> 38:18.355
Especially
not a man girdle!

38:18.363 --> 38:20.703
I have a body mass index
of like 4%.

38:20.699 --> 38:21.929
Oh, and you're
so humble too.

38:21.933 --> 38:22.903
Put your hands
behind your head.

38:22.901 --> 38:25.001
Is this a joke?

38:25.003 --> 38:26.703
My dad's a lawyer.
I'll sue!

38:26.705 --> 38:28.435
Oh, fancy pants words.
You know what?

38:28.440 --> 38:29.940
We have rules
in this here mall.

38:29.941 --> 38:32.981
No disorderly
or lewd behavior.

38:32.978 --> 38:35.508
I saw what you
and Miss Thing were doing

38:35.514 --> 38:37.414
with those
chili fries over there.

38:37.416 --> 38:40.046
Disgusting.
What? It's illegal
to eat chili fries?

38:40.052 --> 38:42.322
Hey. I'm the one asking
the questions around here.

38:43.054 --> 38:44.554
Now touch your nose.

38:44.556 --> 38:46.016
What?
Do it!

38:46.024 --> 38:47.364
Touch your toes.

38:47.359 --> 38:48.859
Stand up.

38:48.860 --> 38:49.890
Walk in
a straight line.

38:49.895 --> 38:50.885
Stop,
turn around.

38:50.896 --> 38:51.956
Walk in
a crooked line.

38:51.963 --> 38:53.363
Stop,
turn around.

38:53.365 --> 38:54.525
Waddle like a duck.

38:54.533 --> 38:55.903
Whoa!
Sing "Rocky Top."

38:55.901 --> 38:57.531
What?
Do the Macarena.

38:57.536 --> 38:58.836
I don't even know
what that is!

38:58.837 --> 39:01.037
Stop.
Quiet.

39:04.475 --> 39:06.675
Let's see what kind of
incriminating items

39:06.678 --> 39:08.078
are on your person.

39:08.080 --> 39:09.350
That's right.

39:09.348 --> 39:10.808
Looking
in your bag.

39:10.816 --> 39:12.446
Looking in your
blue bag.

39:12.451 --> 39:14.651
Looking in your
blue bag--

39:14.653 --> 39:16.393
Oh, zit cream.

39:19.924 --> 39:21.964
Hmm,
back hair remover.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.860
That's for my sister!

39:23.862 --> 39:25.732
Yeah, I've heard
that one before.

39:25.731 --> 39:26.961
That's a lame excuse,
buddy.

39:26.965 --> 39:29.865
Oh, self tanner.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.428
Monica.

39:31.436 --> 39:33.766
I ask you
what self-respecting male

39:33.772 --> 39:34.972
uses self-tanner?

39:34.973 --> 39:36.873
It's been very cloudy!

39:36.875 --> 39:38.835
Okay?
I need to keep a base.

39:38.844 --> 39:40.814
Okay.
That does it, Kyle?

39:40.812 --> 39:43.082
I'm gonna have to
take you downtown.

39:43.081 --> 39:45.781
To the Department
of Imposters,

39:45.784 --> 39:47.884
of fakes, of frauds,
of wannabes--

39:47.886 --> 39:49.586
I don't even think
you're really mall security.

39:49.588 --> 39:51.048
Oh, I assure you
I am.

39:51.056 --> 39:52.086
No.

39:52.090 --> 39:53.860
Actually,
you're not.

40:01.732 --> 40:04.702
So my priceless
little diamond.

40:05.870 --> 40:08.440
Where the devil
are you hiding?

40:08.440 --> 40:09.640
( tablet dings )

40:22.119 --> 40:24.049
Any news
on the Williamson case?

40:25.589 --> 40:26.959
Hey, you,
so here's the thing.

40:26.958 --> 40:28.828
I'm wondering why
you had to, like,

40:28.827 --> 40:30.487
arrest me when I'm
just like hanging out

40:30.495 --> 40:31.995
in the food court
at the mall.

40:31.997 --> 40:33.757
It's because your security
can't, like,

40:33.765 --> 40:35.425
catch real criminals,
right?

40:35.434 --> 40:37.004
You are just too scared
of them, so you're like,

40:37.002 --> 40:38.702
"Oh, hang out at the mall and
see if I can arrest Liz today."

40:38.703 --> 40:39.873
Is that what happened?
Sorry, Liz.

40:39.871 --> 40:41.911
We'll try to expedite
your case.

40:41.907 --> 40:43.567
Yeah, expedite.

40:43.575 --> 40:44.965
That's such
a funny word, see.

40:44.976 --> 40:46.436
I used to work here,
people!

40:46.445 --> 40:48.505
I know
what "expedite" means!

40:50.981 --> 40:52.221
We're gonna be here
for hours.

40:52.217 --> 40:54.017
Okay.

40:56.921 --> 40:59.161
Hey, um...

40:59.157 --> 41:00.917
sorry about
your boyfriend.

41:02.193 --> 41:03.733
It's fine.

41:03.728 --> 41:05.558
I'm not really sure
I liked him

41:05.564 --> 41:06.904
that much anyway.

41:08.732 --> 41:11.902
So how does
a smart girl like you

41:11.903 --> 41:13.873
end up with a jerk
like him?

41:13.872 --> 41:15.972
I, uh...

41:16.907 --> 41:20.807
I set up
an online poll.

41:21.846 --> 41:23.006
Right,
of course you did.

41:23.014 --> 41:24.984
That-That sounds,
that sounds right.

41:24.983 --> 41:26.523
You know, when I heard
the call on the radio,

41:26.518 --> 41:28.118
I thought
the suspect's description

41:28.119 --> 41:31.249
was eerily similar to a certain
partner I once had.

41:32.823 --> 41:34.223
How are you, Liz?

41:34.226 --> 41:36.126
I'm so good, Adam.
So glad you asked.

41:36.127 --> 41:37.727
I've just been having
a leisurely time off,

41:37.729 --> 41:39.059
you know,
going to the spa and such.

41:39.064 --> 41:40.834
Can you please take these
handcuffs off of me?

41:40.832 --> 41:42.902
What part of "under arrest"
do you not understand?

41:42.901 --> 41:43.971
Come on, Ed.

41:45.002 --> 41:46.842
Wait here.

41:46.838 --> 41:48.668
I'll see what I can do about
getting the charges dropped.

41:48.673 --> 41:50.743
Yeah, you're always seeing
what you can do.

41:50.742 --> 41:52.742
How about you actually
do something for a change?

41:52.744 --> 41:54.684
Man,
have I missed you.

41:54.679 --> 41:56.149
I didn't miss you
at all.

41:56.147 --> 41:57.247
( chuckles )

41:57.249 --> 42:00.919
Hey,
is the chief around?

42:00.919 --> 42:03.649
Nope. Meeting
with the mayor.

42:03.655 --> 42:04.815
Lucky.

42:06.957 --> 42:10.957
I can see
why you like him.

42:10.962 --> 42:12.232
He's hot.

42:12.230 --> 42:15.000
What? Ed?
Hot?

42:15.000 --> 42:17.930
No, no, that's--
No, that's ridiculous.

42:17.936 --> 42:20.966
You are crushing him.

42:20.972 --> 42:22.572
It's obvious.

42:22.574 --> 42:23.974
"I haven't missed you
at all."

42:23.975 --> 42:25.135
You were doing
the whole thing with him.

42:25.143 --> 42:26.243
No, no, no, no,
there's no thing.

42:26.244 --> 42:27.914
We don't
have a thing.

42:27.913 --> 42:30.083
No, we-- we were partners,
police partners.

42:30.081 --> 42:31.081
Mm-hmm.

42:31.082 --> 42:32.582
That's it.

42:32.584 --> 42:34.084
Don't you have
some kind of online

42:34.085 --> 42:37.245
poll blogging stuff
that you do

42:37.255 --> 42:38.955
with your little phone
when you touch it

42:38.957 --> 42:39.987
like every 10 seconds?

42:39.991 --> 42:41.621
Nope.

42:41.626 --> 42:43.086
No, you don't have
that to do right now.

42:43.094 --> 42:44.864
Of all times, you don't
do that right now, okay.

42:44.863 --> 42:46.603
How do you even know
I'm single?

42:46.598 --> 42:48.028
You're obviously single.

42:48.033 --> 42:52.343
FYI, Ed has a crush
on you too.

42:54.004 --> 42:56.944
I-I-I don't think he feels
that particular way.

42:56.942 --> 42:59.082
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

42:59.077 --> 43:01.177
Yeah?
What's that?
Flirt.

43:01.179 --> 43:03.209
Flirt?
Yeah. You know,
it's this thing humans do

43:03.214 --> 43:05.014
when they're trying to
demonstrate attraction--

43:05.016 --> 43:06.146
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
I know what flirting is.

43:06.151 --> 43:08.151
I'm just--
I'm just--

43:08.153 --> 43:10.053
I'm not very
well-versed at it.

43:10.055 --> 43:12.215
You know,
it's remarkably easy

43:12.223 --> 43:13.993
once you put
your mind to it.

43:13.992 --> 43:15.892
Instead of
insulting people,

43:15.894 --> 43:17.094
compliment them.

43:19.363 --> 43:20.363
What do you
even know?

43:20.365 --> 43:21.655
You're like 12.

43:21.666 --> 43:23.326
Okay, try it on him.

43:23.335 --> 43:26.265
I will do nothing
of the sort.

43:27.638 --> 43:28.968
Yeah, you know,

43:28.974 --> 43:30.844
I didn't think
you had it in you.

43:30.842 --> 43:32.912
( sighs )

43:32.911 --> 43:35.911
Really?
Even with the sigh...

43:35.914 --> 43:37.214
With your brown eyes.

43:37.215 --> 43:38.945
"I didn't think
you had it in you,

43:38.950 --> 43:40.680
"you think that's gonna
get me to like turn around

43:40.685 --> 43:42.045
and be like,
Dennis, Dennis.

43:42.053 --> 43:44.193
You think, I'm just
gonna be like, yeah, Dennis.

43:44.189 --> 43:45.889
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, Dennis. I'm just--

43:45.890 --> 43:46.960
What do you want, Liz?

43:49.827 --> 43:53.197
Dennis,
has anyone ever told you

43:53.198 --> 43:55.768
that you have really nice...

43:57.668 --> 44:00.268
large nostrils?

44:04.908 --> 44:06.308
Whatever, Liz.

44:06.311 --> 44:08.281
Yeah.
Yeah, whatever.

44:08.279 --> 44:11.379
"Large nostrils"?
That's what you got?

44:11.383 --> 44:13.023
He has really large nostrils.

44:13.018 --> 44:14.948
You don't necessarily
have to point that out.

44:14.953 --> 44:17.053
What am I supposed to do, lie?
Say he has small nostrils?

44:17.055 --> 44:18.755
Oh, my goodness.
Sorry.

44:18.757 --> 44:20.887
I got some good news
and bad news.

44:20.892 --> 44:21.892
Yeah.

44:21.893 --> 44:22.963
The good news is...

44:23.894 --> 44:25.134
they got the charges 86.

44:25.130 --> 44:26.430
Great.

44:26.431 --> 44:27.831
The bad news is--

44:27.832 --> 44:28.902
Where is she?

44:31.035 --> 44:34.835
You?
In my office, now!

44:39.843 --> 44:40.983
Shut the door!

44:43.914 --> 44:46.154
Shoplifting sunglasses?

44:46.151 --> 44:49.021
Impersonating mall security?
What were you thinking?

44:49.020 --> 44:50.390
I was thinking that
it was very bright out,

44:50.388 --> 44:52.718
and that I, you know,
needed to protect my eyes.

44:52.724 --> 44:54.964
You're a complete disgrace
to this badge!

44:54.959 --> 44:58.289
Thanks to you, I'm actually
not wearing a badge, so--

44:58.296 --> 45:02.326
Well,
they seem friendly.

45:02.333 --> 45:06.273
Liz and the chief have
a special relationship.

45:06.271 --> 45:09.341
Yeah, clearly one
that involves a lot of yelling.

45:09.340 --> 45:11.940
Well, the chief always
expected a lot from Liz.

45:11.943 --> 45:14.983
She's one of this
department's rising stars.

45:14.979 --> 45:17.909
Really?
Liz?

45:17.916 --> 45:19.146
Well, she's a little rough
around the edges

45:19.150 --> 45:22.050
but she's the best partner
I ever had.

45:23.387 --> 45:25.147
The diamond is gone.

45:25.156 --> 45:27.986
Get that through
your thick skull!

45:27.992 --> 45:29.862
Why did she quit?

45:29.861 --> 45:31.291
She didn't quit.

45:31.296 --> 45:32.956
What?

45:32.964 --> 45:33.964
She didn't tell you
what happened?

45:33.965 --> 45:36.965
No.

45:36.968 --> 45:38.328
Well, that's her business.

45:40.437 --> 45:42.037
I get it. I get it.
Okay.

45:42.040 --> 45:44.110
Let's go!

45:50.914 --> 45:53.224
How about you stay out
of trouble for a change?

45:53.218 --> 45:54.848
How about you keep your nose
on your face

45:54.853 --> 45:56.993
and not in everybody's
business?

45:56.988 --> 45:58.858
It's good seeing you, Liz.
Yeah.

45:58.857 --> 46:01.217
If you need anything,
I'm around, okay?

46:01.226 --> 46:02.886
Okay, thanks.

46:02.894 --> 46:04.894
And hey. I'm a cop.

46:04.896 --> 46:06.296
Having my nose
in everyone's business

46:06.297 --> 46:08.227
is my business.

46:08.233 --> 46:10.203
Whatever.

46:10.201 --> 46:14.271
So let's get back to
the shopping and the grooming

46:14.272 --> 46:17.212
and whatever
other nonsense it is

46:17.208 --> 46:18.408
that we have to do here.

46:19.777 --> 46:21.107
What's really going on?

46:21.945 --> 46:23.175
Nothing.

46:23.181 --> 46:25.051
Why were you thrown off
the force?

46:26.550 --> 46:29.250
And why do you really care about
a piece of costume jewelry?

46:30.788 --> 46:33.988
Tell me or you can forget
about the deal.

46:36.293 --> 46:37.533
It's not costume jewelry.

46:47.304 --> 46:48.874
It's not costume jewelry.

46:50.974 --> 46:54.444
The center stone in the
necklace is a 21 carat

46:54.445 --> 46:59.145
pink diamond worth
roughly $7 million.

47:01.285 --> 47:02.915
Wait, what?

47:02.921 --> 47:04.891
Yeah.

47:05.923 --> 47:07.223
It was stolen 2 months ago.

47:08.292 --> 47:09.892
It was my fault.

47:13.964 --> 47:16.534
There was a traveling
exhibit of jewelry

47:16.534 --> 47:18.204
on display at the
Civic Museum.

47:20.070 --> 47:22.040
And the necklace,
your necklace,

47:22.040 --> 47:24.510
was the star attraction.

47:24.509 --> 47:27.139
I knew there was
something special about it.

47:27.145 --> 47:29.945
I was in charge of security.

47:29.948 --> 47:33.318
It was a real,
real high-profile assignment.

47:33.318 --> 47:34.518
Ed offered to help me,

47:34.519 --> 47:37.489
but, I knew
I had this on my own.

47:37.488 --> 47:40.288
There was one thing
I didn't count on.

47:40.291 --> 47:45.091
Pierce Peters, one of the
world's foremost jewel thieves.

48:01.378 --> 48:03.148
( alarm ringing )

48:16.059 --> 48:18.089
You know, being one of the
only women on the force

48:18.096 --> 48:19.556
and with the chief
constantly breathing

48:19.564 --> 48:21.564
down my neck,
it doesn't always feel like

48:21.566 --> 48:24.996
an option for me
to ask for help.

48:28.105 --> 48:29.165
So...

48:32.075 --> 48:33.675
I didn't call for backup.

48:36.947 --> 48:38.177
I didn't call for backup.

48:39.383 --> 48:41.153
I thought I had him.

48:47.391 --> 48:50.531
<i> And that's when everything</i>
<i>just starting to go downhill.</i>

48:50.528 --> 48:53.528
<i> Losing that diamond was</i>
<i> a black mark on my record</i>

48:53.531 --> 48:57.101
<i> and erasing that mark</i>
<i>was all I could think about.</i>

48:57.101 --> 49:02.441
<i> And work starting slipping</i>
<i> and nobody understood.</i>

49:02.440 --> 49:03.510
<i> I needed to make this</i>
<i> right.</i>

49:04.708 --> 49:07.308
See, but...

49:07.312 --> 49:09.352
eventually the chief
had enough and...

49:12.416 --> 49:15.516
Turning by badge in was
one of the worst moments

49:15.520 --> 49:16.590
of my life.

49:18.088 --> 49:21.218
Wow. That's...

49:23.460 --> 49:25.590
That's pretty awful.
I'm sorry.

49:25.596 --> 49:26.956
Yeah.

49:26.965 --> 49:29.195
But...

49:29.200 --> 49:31.130
how did I end up
with the diamond?

49:31.135 --> 49:34.095
Well...

49:35.472 --> 49:37.742
<i> Pierce found a buyer</i>
<i> for the diamond</i>

49:37.742 --> 49:39.612
<i> and he arranged an exchange.</i>

49:54.024 --> 49:55.464
<i> But unfortunately for him</i>

49:55.460 --> 49:57.330
<i> and the</i>
<i> rest of society actually,</i>

49:57.328 --> 49:59.398
<i> the safari look</i>
<i> was in this season.</i>

50:06.203 --> 50:09.673
<i> And he gave the diamond</i>
<i> to the wrong man.</i>

50:11.174 --> 50:15.014
<i> So the necklace went on</i>
<i> a bit of an adventure.</i>

50:15.013 --> 50:17.683
<i> No one else was aware</i>
<i>of the diamond's real value.</i>

50:17.682 --> 50:20.552
<i> MONICA: How did you find</i>
<i> all this out?</i>

50:20.551 --> 50:22.121
LIZ: A lot of good old
fashioned shoe leather.

50:22.120 --> 50:24.750
I combed through
taxi GPS data,

50:24.756 --> 50:28.356
watched thousands of hours
of surveillance footage.

50:32.062 --> 50:33.662
Interviewed the mime
which was interesting,

50:33.664 --> 50:35.364
because he is a mime.

50:35.366 --> 50:37.496
And did you know that...

50:37.502 --> 50:38.772
is "no" in mime.

50:38.770 --> 50:40.070
Hmm.

50:41.505 --> 50:43.805
LIZ: Anyway I tracked
a food truck for days

50:43.808 --> 50:45.808
and that necklace

50:45.810 --> 50:48.040
got it traded
for hotdog.

50:48.812 --> 50:51.412
Lost to a biker
in a card game.

50:55.452 --> 50:57.252
Sold to a pawn shop...

51:02.092 --> 51:05.592
where it was discovered
by a local high school girl

51:05.596 --> 51:07.296
looking for something
to wear to prom.

51:12.803 --> 51:17.073
And that pretty much
brings us up to date.

51:18.708 --> 51:22.078
Why didn't you just
tell me the truth?

51:22.080 --> 51:23.810
Well, because,
how could I be sure that

51:23.815 --> 51:26.115
once you knew
the value of the diamond

51:26.117 --> 51:29.387
that you wouldn't disappear
and try to sell it yourself?

51:29.387 --> 51:32.247
Yeah, but you could've
just sent the cops.

51:32.256 --> 51:34.086
No. No. No.

51:34.092 --> 51:36.692
You don't get it.
You don't get it.

51:38.462 --> 51:43.472
See, I want to be the one
to march the diamond in there.

51:43.468 --> 51:46.598
I want to take that necklace
into that station,

51:46.604 --> 51:48.274
look the chief square
in the eye

51:48.272 --> 51:50.342
and say,
"Lieutenant Elizabeth Morgan

51:50.341 --> 51:51.841
reporting recovery
of stolen goods."

51:51.843 --> 51:55.613
I need to be the one
to make this right, Monica.

51:55.613 --> 51:57.253
That's kind of
your thing, huh?

51:58.381 --> 52:00.881
Making things right
on your own.

52:02.152 --> 52:03.352
Lone Ranger-style.

52:05.655 --> 52:07.655
Lone Ranger style.

52:09.359 --> 52:10.789
I like it.

52:10.795 --> 52:14.755
You know, that necklace was
the one part of my outfit

52:14.765 --> 52:17.465
that I didn't put up
for a vote.

52:17.468 --> 52:18.868
I just...

52:18.870 --> 52:20.440
I just really liked it.

52:20.438 --> 52:22.168
Wow!

52:22.173 --> 52:25.883
As it turns out, you have
exorbitantly expensive taste.

52:29.779 --> 52:31.179
Can I ask you
something?

52:35.752 --> 52:39.792
Why is it so hard for you
to make a choice on your own?

52:39.790 --> 52:41.690
I don't know.

52:41.692 --> 52:43.932
I guess...
I just...

52:43.928 --> 52:46.498
I don't want to
make the wrong choice.

52:46.497 --> 52:50.467
Yeah, but that's how you learn,
by making mistakes.

52:50.468 --> 52:51.828
Everyone says that.

52:51.836 --> 52:53.696
But there are
real consequences.

52:53.704 --> 52:54.904
There's real conseq--
Okay.

52:54.906 --> 52:56.466
You're like
16 years old.

52:56.474 --> 52:57.844
What's the worst
that can happen?

52:57.842 --> 53:00.512
You wear blue eyeshadow
instead of green?

53:00.511 --> 53:02.581
I mean, not that I care.
I'm colorblind.

53:04.381 --> 53:07.351
I could be
a disappointment.

53:08.618 --> 53:11.618
People might not want to be
around me.

53:13.490 --> 53:15.620
Is this still about Kyle?

53:17.260 --> 53:19.600
Kyle.
Sure.

53:19.597 --> 53:21.857
Or...

53:21.866 --> 53:23.266
my mom.

53:25.535 --> 53:28.735
You got to be pretty
disappointing

53:28.739 --> 53:29.869
to leave a 3 year old.

53:35.679 --> 53:37.209
That...

53:39.616 --> 53:42.216
That was not your fault.

53:45.622 --> 53:48.422
That's why I want to be
prom queen.

53:49.559 --> 53:50.959
You know people like you.

53:50.962 --> 53:53.562
I mean you got...
You got the title,

53:53.564 --> 53:56.974
you got the crown,
a page in the yearbook.

53:57.934 --> 53:58.974
It's official.

53:58.970 --> 54:01.000
It's real.

54:02.806 --> 54:04.336
Oh, no!
What time is it?

54:04.342 --> 54:05.672
That's about 2 o'clock.

54:05.676 --> 54:06.736
My driver's test!

54:06.744 --> 54:07.884
Oh, gosh,
here we go again.

54:07.878 --> 54:09.808
Here we go.

54:09.814 --> 54:11.654
Hi! Hi! Hi!

54:11.649 --> 54:13.249
I'm here
for my driver's test.

54:13.251 --> 54:14.921
Please tell me
I made it.

54:14.919 --> 54:16.449
I can't handle missing any more
appointments today.

54:16.454 --> 54:17.524
You made it.

54:17.521 --> 54:19.791
Barely.
Thank you.

54:19.790 --> 54:21.620
Is this the car she'll be
using for your exam?

54:21.626 --> 54:23.686
I'm sorry the what you'll be
using for what?

54:23.694 --> 54:25.794
You understand,
it is a driving test.

54:25.796 --> 54:27.396
You'll need
something to drive.

54:29.366 --> 54:31.796
Hi!
No. No.

54:31.802 --> 54:34.772
Yes.
No. This was not
part of the deal, okay.

54:34.772 --> 54:36.412
This was not
part of the deal.

54:36.407 --> 54:37.807
No one drives Brando
but me.

54:37.808 --> 54:40.478
Okay. So you got to be
gentle with Brando, okay.

54:40.478 --> 54:41.838
He's quick off the line.

54:41.846 --> 54:43.576
Sorry. Sorry.

54:43.581 --> 54:44.951
And the steering's loose
until it gets about 40.

54:44.949 --> 54:46.819
And the brakes are new
so go easy...

54:46.817 --> 54:48.817
Sorry.
On him.

54:48.819 --> 54:50.049
LIZ: And be careful parking.

54:50.054 --> 54:51.424
Ma'am?
This is your daughter's test.

54:51.422 --> 54:52.662
Not yours.

54:52.657 --> 54:54.587
She's not my daughter.
Forget it.

54:54.592 --> 54:55.822
Just...

54:55.826 --> 54:57.586
pull Brando
out of the traffic.

54:58.828 --> 55:00.658
Watch the traffic.

55:00.665 --> 55:01.725
Stop!

55:03.400 --> 55:04.970
Sorry.

55:06.736 --> 55:07.866
Straight.

55:07.872 --> 55:08.942
Okay.

55:12.442 --> 55:14.082
( beeping )

55:14.078 --> 55:15.678
What the...?

55:15.680 --> 55:17.480
Oh, ignore it.
That's just my radar.

55:17.481 --> 55:19.321
It means there's a highway
patrol in the area.

55:19.317 --> 55:20.847
That's actually not legal.

55:20.851 --> 55:22.581
Oh!

55:22.586 --> 55:23.646
Garbage Truck!

55:25.555 --> 55:27.385
( indistinct chattering )

55:32.329 --> 55:33.429
( indistinct )

55:34.864 --> 55:35.964
Garbage cans!

55:41.771 --> 55:44.671
Stop now immediately.

55:44.675 --> 55:45.865
At least
I signaled that time.

55:45.876 --> 55:47.036
Pull over!

55:53.016 --> 55:55.876
Get out! You're not driving
another inch.

55:55.886 --> 55:57.946
Wait. Please.
Give me one more chance.

56:00.423 --> 56:01.663
Floor it!
What?

56:01.659 --> 56:02.759
LIZ: It's Pierce!

56:02.760 --> 56:04.490
Go now!

56:05.895 --> 56:07.955
So, I have to keep driving
for a few more minutes.

56:07.965 --> 56:09.865
Maybe you can reset the test,
give me one more chance.

56:11.434 --> 56:13.044
Go faster!
I cannot go faster.

56:13.037 --> 56:14.497
There's a speed limit.

56:14.505 --> 56:16.965
Okay.
I'm still being graded.

56:16.974 --> 56:17.974
Yellow light!

56:17.975 --> 56:20.475
Run it!

56:20.478 --> 56:21.978
That was still yellow.
That was still yellow.

56:21.979 --> 56:23.409
You can't dock me
for that one.

56:27.450 --> 56:28.680
You got to go, okay.

56:28.686 --> 56:30.486
We do not want this guy
to catch us.

56:30.488 --> 56:33.118
Stop! Can somebody tell me
what the devil's happening?

56:33.124 --> 56:34.624
Get me out of this car.

56:34.625 --> 56:36.425
Oh, gosh.
Would you stop your crying?

56:36.427 --> 56:38.487
Okay. Just hold on
you big baby.

56:38.496 --> 56:40.756
I'm calling the police!
That's not really going
to work in here.

56:40.765 --> 56:41.755
No signal?

56:41.766 --> 56:43.096
Yeah. I told you.

56:43.100 --> 56:45.000
( screaming )

56:47.437 --> 56:48.567
Oh! Oh!

56:48.572 --> 56:49.872
Okay.

56:54.778 --> 56:55.908
There, there.
Take the freeway.

56:55.913 --> 56:57.983
I've never been
on the freeway.

56:57.982 --> 57:00.882
Don't get on the freeway.
Yes! No!
Don't get on the freeway!

57:06.689 --> 57:07.819
Wow!

57:07.825 --> 57:09.925
Close one.
That was terrifying.

57:09.927 --> 57:12.057
Everything about this ride
has been terrifying!

57:12.062 --> 57:14.562
Well, it's about to get
a whole lot more terrifying.

57:14.565 --> 57:15.795
He's gaining on us.

57:37.887 --> 57:40.657
Nitro boost.
What?

57:40.658 --> 57:42.488
Keep your eye on the road.
I'm gonna hit the red button.

57:42.493 --> 57:43.993
The red button? You said
not to push the red button.

57:43.994 --> 57:45.534
I'm going to push
the red button.

57:45.529 --> 57:47.029
Why are you pushing
the red button?

57:47.031 --> 57:49.701
Never push the red button.
Don't you watch movies?

57:49.700 --> 57:51.570
It's time, folks.

57:51.569 --> 57:53.869
Okay, tighten your seatbelts,
we're about to go a lot faster.

57:53.871 --> 57:55.641
No. Please don't
make us go faster.

57:56.573 --> 58:00.113
One, two, three!

58:01.678 --> 58:03.608
( indistinct )

58:03.614 --> 58:05.954
Help me please!

58:15.625 --> 58:18.855
( tires screeching )

58:22.565 --> 58:24.065
I'm driving here!

58:24.068 --> 58:25.198
Out of the way!

58:25.202 --> 58:26.702
Oh, yeah?

58:31.941 --> 58:33.541
You've got to be kidding me.

58:49.292 --> 58:51.732
So...

58:51.729 --> 58:52.789
did I pass?

59:07.210 --> 59:08.840
"Here's one
without the bedpan.

59:08.846 --> 59:11.806
Northwest Hospital."
Found you.

59:11.815 --> 59:13.545
Northwest.

59:20.990 --> 59:22.860
You have to give me
another chance.

59:22.860 --> 59:24.590
You cannot fail me.
Oh. No.

59:24.595 --> 59:26.295
I most certainly can.
And I have.

59:26.297 --> 59:28.097
You are totally,
completely, failed.

59:28.098 --> 59:29.128
Okay.
Well, well, wait...

59:29.133 --> 59:30.833
That other driver,

59:30.834 --> 59:32.674
I got away from him without
breaking the speed limit.

59:32.670 --> 59:34.000
I mean, that kind of
defensive driving

59:34.004 --> 59:36.204
has to count
for something, right?

59:36.206 --> 59:38.736
Miss, you are quite literally
the most dangerous driver

59:38.742 --> 59:40.182
I've ever tested.

59:40.177 --> 59:42.007
You're lucky I don't
permanently ban you

59:42.012 --> 59:43.882
from driving forever.

59:43.881 --> 59:47.051
I don't legally think
that you can do that.
Yeah.

59:47.051 --> 59:49.751
You can take your test again
in 9 months.
Nine months?

59:49.753 --> 59:51.193
And you should consider
yourself lucky,

59:51.188 --> 59:52.818
I haven't thrown you
in jail.

59:52.823 --> 59:54.123
What? Hey! Hey! Hey!

59:54.124 --> 59:55.724
We're not gonna be
talking about jail here.

59:55.726 --> 59:57.226
You can't legally
do that either.

59:58.995 --> 01:00:00.295
( indistinct )

01:00:00.297 --> 01:00:02.357
What are you doing?

01:00:02.366 --> 01:00:03.866
DMV: I'm having
Brando impounded.

01:00:03.867 --> 01:00:05.727
Apparently, I can do that.

01:00:05.736 --> 01:00:07.666
It's a death trap.

01:00:07.671 --> 01:00:09.741
No way all that gear
can be legal.

01:00:10.673 --> 01:00:12.343
It most certainly is!

01:00:12.343 --> 01:00:13.343
Brando!

01:00:13.344 --> 01:00:16.314
Brando, Brando, Brando...

01:00:16.313 --> 01:00:17.883
(sighs)

01:00:17.881 --> 01:00:21.351
(shouts, grunts)

01:00:21.352 --> 01:00:22.352
Get out your phone!

01:00:22.353 --> 01:00:23.853
Get your device!

01:00:23.854 --> 01:00:26.764
Do your things with the apps
and the, and the...

01:00:26.757 --> 01:00:29.187
Ober and the uCab
and whatever!

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.130
I can't believe
that just happened.

01:00:32.129 --> 01:00:34.699
Monica, I mean, you're a
pretty terrible driver.

01:00:34.698 --> 01:00:37.228
It's all ruined!
Everything!

01:00:37.234 --> 01:00:41.974
My outfit, my relationship,
the prom, my future ability
to transport myself.

01:00:41.972 --> 01:00:45.412
It's all because of...
you and that stupid necklace!

01:00:45.409 --> 01:00:48.079
And this has literally been
the worst day of my life!

01:00:48.078 --> 01:00:51.308
Hey, look, there's
no need to get pouty, okay?
I am not getting pouty!

01:00:51.315 --> 01:00:53.875
You're getting pouty! Look!
Pierce is still out there, okay?

01:00:53.884 --> 01:00:57.894
You are still in danger.
(laughing) What?
You're gonna protect me?

01:00:57.888 --> 01:01:01.018
The washed up cop
that drove everyone so crazy
she got herself fired?

01:01:01.025 --> 01:01:03.925
That's not what happened.
Oh, really? 'Cause
I can see what happened.

01:01:03.927 --> 01:01:08.227
You're so obsessive and narrow
minded, you have no idea what's
actually going on around you.

01:01:08.232 --> 01:01:10.732
Whoa, right,
I'm the obsessive one.
Yeah.

01:01:10.734 --> 01:01:14.774
"so people will love me,
though yes." (click)

01:01:14.772 --> 01:01:18.042
Are you kidding me?! At least
I have enough sense of self

01:01:18.042 --> 01:01:21.042
that I'm not
constantly seeking approval!
Because nobody approves of you!

01:01:23.312 --> 01:01:28.452
You know what? You need to give
me the diamond, and we need to
get you back to the station.

01:01:28.452 --> 01:01:31.222
'Kay, look, okay,
you want the diamond?
You can have the diamond.

01:01:31.221 --> 01:01:34.191
Really?
Yeah, just take it, I'm done
with it. I'm done with you.

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:36.461
The diamond
is actually on you?

01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:38.690
It's in my purse.

01:01:39.429 --> 01:01:40.959
Where is your purse?

01:01:42.965 --> 01:01:44.895
In the car.

01:01:44.902 --> 01:01:48.072
Oh, God, in the...
Well, come on,
we have to go get it!

01:01:48.072 --> 01:01:50.942
You have to go get it!
I am going back home, and...

01:01:50.941 --> 01:01:53.911
trying to put my life
back together again, and...

01:01:53.911 --> 01:01:57.851
Forget I ever met you!
No, Monica,
we have to go and get...

01:01:57.848 --> 01:01:58.978
the...necklace, it's...

01:01:58.982 --> 01:02:00.982
(shouts)

01:02:02.452 --> 01:02:05.752
(scoffs) You know what?
You know what?

01:02:05.756 --> 01:02:07.386
I have one of these too!

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:12.086
Operator, I need
the number for a cab.

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:17.773
(clears throat)
Yes, I'm aware that no one
calls information any more.

01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:24.012
Hi, um...

01:02:29.045 --> 01:02:32.975
No! No, no.
I'm very okay.

01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:34.976
<i> Hello, Monica.</i>

01:02:36.152 --> 01:02:39.352
<i>We've so much</i>
<i>to catch up on, so...</i>

01:02:39.356 --> 01:02:44.326
<i>be a dear, and come to the</i>
<i>warehouse at the end of, uh...</i>

01:02:44.328 --> 01:02:46.898
<i>North Shore and Sunset.</i>

01:02:46.897 --> 01:02:50.967
<i>Oh, and don't forget</i>
<i>to bring my little jewel,</i>

01:02:50.968 --> 01:02:54.038
<i>or things might get a little...</i>

01:02:54.037 --> 01:02:55.267
<i>unpleasant.</i>

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:02.113
MONICA:
Taxi! Taxi.

01:03:04.046 --> 01:03:06.946
LIZ:
No, I just need a regular cab
to come pick me up.

01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:08.520
Surely they still
have those, right?

01:03:08.519 --> 01:03:11.989
They're usually yellow,
and some say "Taxi" on top,

01:03:11.989 --> 01:03:14.959
and sometimes they have
little numbers
on the side that you...

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:16.828
Liz! Liz! Liz!
Monica? I'll call you back!

01:03:16.827 --> 01:03:18.957
What?
Pierce has my dad!

01:03:18.962 --> 01:03:21.902
<i> And don't forget to bring</i>
<i> my little jewel...</i>

01:03:21.899 --> 01:03:23.429
<i> ...or things</i>
<i> might get a little...</i>

01:03:24.834 --> 01:03:26.004
<i>...unpleasant. </i>

01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:28.997
What do we do?

01:03:29.939 --> 01:03:32.109
We do what he says.

01:03:32.109 --> 01:03:34.409
But we don't even
have the diamond.

01:03:34.411 --> 01:03:36.211
That's our first stop.

01:03:36.213 --> 01:03:40.053
You're gonna have to use your
phone to summon us a cab.

01:03:46.055 --> 01:03:48.355
I need a new phone.
Yeah, you do. Come on.

01:03:53.296 --> 01:03:56.126
Hi, hi. Arnie, Arnie, hi.

01:03:56.133 --> 01:03:58.203
Wait, I need to get
my car back.
Yeah.

01:03:58.202 --> 01:04:00.542
Fill out all seven
release forms and have a seat.

01:04:00.537 --> 01:04:03.037
Listen, we're really
in a rush.
So are all of them.

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:06.210
Okay, you know what?
I didn't want to do this,
but here you go.

01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:08.140
Yeah, I'm FBI.
I mean, come on.

01:04:08.145 --> 01:04:11.175
I don't care if it was
J. Edgar Hoover himself.

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:14.881
You sit down and you wait,
just like everybody else.

01:04:14.885 --> 01:04:18.285
Well, can you at least
tell me if my car
is in this lot or not?

01:04:18.288 --> 01:04:23.858
Sure! After you fill out
the forms, have a seat, and wait
just like everybody else!

01:04:23.861 --> 01:04:26.431
You are a very angry person!
Okay, stop, stop.
Just come here.

01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:28.900
MONICA: What do we do now?

01:04:28.899 --> 01:04:32.529
We don't have time
to wait here forever.
Monica, honestly, I don't know!

01:04:35.972 --> 01:04:38.072
Not a word.

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:41.375
(sighs) Come on.

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:42.538
Excuse me.

01:04:45.882 --> 01:04:49.992
You know, I probably could
take a look at the IT system.

01:04:49.987 --> 01:04:52.517
Really?
Yeah, it's...

01:04:52.522 --> 01:04:55.492
just your standard
SQL database, probably.

01:04:55.492 --> 01:04:58.292
You know, I could get in,
find your car, get it cleared.

01:04:58.295 --> 01:05:01.925
I do it with the library system
when I take too long
to read the books.

01:05:01.932 --> 01:05:04.002
But it's hopeless
without a password.

01:05:05.368 --> 01:05:07.168
"Poopy."
What?!

01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:09.370
That's the password. "Poopy."

01:05:09.373 --> 01:05:11.043
How do you know?

01:05:11.041 --> 01:05:14.081
%83 of people use
their pet's name
as their password,

01:05:14.077 --> 01:05:19.507
and I'm guessing that number
is closer to %100 when you and
your dog have matching t-shirts.

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:27.361
I need to get back there.
Okay, I'll distract him.

01:05:27.357 --> 01:05:31.087
How?
(sighs) I don't know, compliment
him, right?

01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:32.964
(inhales deeply)
Just...follow my lead.

01:05:36.065 --> 01:05:38.125
(exhales, whispers)
Come on.

01:05:42.271 --> 01:05:43.341
Um...

01:05:44.273 --> 01:05:45.343
Arnie...

01:05:48.711 --> 01:05:51.081
Hey, I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

01:05:51.081 --> 01:05:53.721
Ma'am, I just
need the forms.

01:05:53.717 --> 01:05:57.987
Um, has anyone
ever told you that...

01:05:57.988 --> 01:06:02.618
you have great...a great...

01:06:02.626 --> 01:06:04.026
forehead?

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:07.201
Huh?

01:06:07.197 --> 01:06:11.027
Yeah, it's--it's round,
and your--your hair is like
way back here,

01:06:11.034 --> 01:06:13.674
and then it goes,
"Whoop, whoop!"

01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:17.040
Ma'am, could you just please
have a seat, and--
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:19.340
Look,I have a forehead thing.
It's weird, I know, okay?

01:06:19.343 --> 01:06:21.713
What I'm trying
to say is that...

01:06:21.712 --> 01:06:23.082
You have a tough job.

01:06:24.613 --> 01:06:27.323
Yes, you do,
but you have a certain
intellect, I see...

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:30.417
The smarts and the thinking
and the brain stuff,

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:33.290
and--and you're
good at your job.
And I respect that.

01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:35.460
Thanks, that's...

01:06:35.459 --> 01:06:37.489
actually nice to hear.
You know, well, um...

01:06:37.494 --> 01:06:39.734
nobody ever seems to appreciate
what I do around here.

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:42.363
I...I do.

01:06:42.366 --> 01:06:43.726
I-- I-- f...

01:06:43.734 --> 01:06:46.674
find it very attractive...

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:51.670
when a man is good at his job.

01:06:51.675 --> 01:06:54.075
Yeah?
Yeah.

01:06:54.077 --> 01:06:56.207
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. You know,
you, you, you

01:06:56.213 --> 01:07:01.523
sit in that chair,
all day, and you are
the guardian of cars.

01:07:01.518 --> 01:07:05.018
And you deal with people,
and that takes
a strong constitution.

01:07:05.022 --> 01:07:08.362
You know, your constitution
is so strong.

01:07:08.358 --> 01:07:11.788
You know, I really don't feel
like I'm appreciated
in this job.

01:07:11.795 --> 01:07:15.755
I can see that. And this job,
I mean it's hard for people
to see the real you.

01:07:15.766 --> 01:07:18.096
That's exactly right,
I mean, like,

01:07:18.101 --> 01:07:20.041
I'm stuck in this
office all day.

01:07:20.037 --> 01:07:22.737
It's tough for a man.

01:07:22.739 --> 01:07:25.469
I mean, it can't help
that you're so...

01:07:26.409 --> 01:07:28.109
Uh, handsome!

01:07:28.111 --> 01:07:30.251
Did I just say that out loud?
Whoa, I said it, yep.

01:07:30.247 --> 01:07:33.247
(inhales) It must make people
feel really insecure.

01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:34.320
Handsome?

01:07:35.284 --> 01:07:36.354
Me?

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:42.260
You know, this may be
against protocol, but...

01:07:42.259 --> 01:07:48.199
for you, maybe I can bend
the rules just a little bit
and check on your car.

01:07:48.198 --> 01:07:49.428
Okay.

01:07:49.433 --> 01:07:52.173
What is the plate number?

01:07:52.169 --> 01:07:57.439
It is, uh, four?
"L"... Four.

01:07:58.741 --> 01:08:00.381
"M"...

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:05.750
"K"...

01:08:08.617 --> 01:08:09.747
Sorry, say that again?

01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:12.623
Four...
Yeah.

01:08:12.622 --> 01:08:14.122
"L"...
"L."

01:08:14.124 --> 01:08:16.094
"Four."
"Four, 'L,' Four..."

01:08:17.593 --> 01:08:19.193
"'M', one, 'K'"

01:08:19.196 --> 01:08:21.126
"4L4M1K"

01:08:21.131 --> 01:08:23.501
Uh...well!

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:27.470
Looks here like
I'm the one that needs to be
apologizing to you!

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:33.111
It says here your car was,
"Towed in error," and it's ready
for immediate release.

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:35.240
Wow, that's great news.
That's great news.

01:08:35.245 --> 01:08:39.645
Here, um, just take this...

01:08:39.649 --> 01:08:42.749
and give it to
the guard on level three.
Actually...

01:08:46.822 --> 01:08:48.292
That's my phone number.

01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:51.861
Maybe we could, uh,
have dinner some time?

01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:54.661
I'll bring my forehead.

01:08:56.465 --> 01:08:58.194
(snaps fingers) Yeah, you will!

01:08:59.835 --> 01:09:03.505
What are you doin'
back there?!
Um, uh, you know, I was, I was

01:09:03.506 --> 01:09:05.506
looking for the bathroom.

01:09:05.509 --> 01:09:07.179
Second door on the right!

01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:09.176
I can hold it. (laughs)

01:09:09.179 --> 01:09:12.149
She'll hold it.
She's good like that.

01:09:13.883 --> 01:09:15.653
You know...

01:09:15.652 --> 01:09:18.252
You and your daughter
look like you could be sisters.

01:09:19.555 --> 01:09:20.885
Well, thanks.
Thank you.
Yeah, okay.

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:22.161
Go, go, go!

01:09:24.527 --> 01:09:27.926
MONICA:
Nice work! I gotta say,
I didn't think
you had it in you.

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:30.930
I didn't either. But you,
you with the computer,
you were amazing!

01:09:30.934 --> 01:09:33.804
You're like Bill Gates
but...smarter
and with no glasses.

01:09:33.803 --> 01:09:36.673
I can see why MIT wants you.

01:09:36.673 --> 01:09:38.412
We make a pretty great team.

01:09:38.408 --> 01:09:39.468
Yeah.

01:09:42.243 --> 01:09:43.714
Um...

01:09:43.712 --> 01:09:45.212
The diamond isn't here.

01:09:46.682 --> 01:09:48.452
What?
Well, I don't know!

01:09:48.451 --> 01:09:50.451
I put it
in my makeup and now it's gone.

01:09:50.453 --> 01:09:53.323
Wha--
Wait, this is "Desert Flame."

01:09:53.323 --> 01:09:57.393
This is not my color,
I'm a "Mountain Sunset."
(stammering) What happened?

01:09:57.394 --> 01:10:00.334
I have no idea,
I would never wear
"Desert Flame."

01:10:00.330 --> 01:10:02.900
I'm a winter.
It completely
washes me out.

01:10:02.899 --> 01:10:05.599
I know, I know. Okay,
just think, think, think.
(sighs)

01:10:05.602 --> 01:10:08.902
SIERRA:
You are a strong,
independent woman,
and he is a shallow dirtbag.

01:10:09.838 --> 01:10:11.538
Sierra!
Sierra!

01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:12.611
MONICA:
She's at the park!

01:10:12.609 --> 01:10:13.979
LIZ:
Why is she at the park?

01:10:13.977 --> 01:10:17.247
Prom pictures, it's
the prettiest spot in town.

01:10:17.247 --> 01:10:20.677
(scoffs) Please call me the
second you get this!

01:10:20.684 --> 01:10:22.624
This is a crazy, serious,
monster emergency!

01:10:23.786 --> 01:10:26.216
The park is huge,
she could be anywhere!

01:10:26.223 --> 01:10:27.993
How are we supposed
to get to her?

01:10:30.426 --> 01:10:31.926
We need bikes, quick.

01:10:31.928 --> 01:10:33.488
Ah, we only have
one left.
We'll take it.

01:10:34.396 --> 01:10:35.556
LIZ: Take it easy,

01:10:35.565 --> 01:10:36.555
it's a little bumpy
in here!

01:10:36.566 --> 01:10:37.566
I'm trying here, okay?

01:10:37.567 --> 01:10:39.397
<i> Clear the road, people.</i>

01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:42.002
<i> Stay clear of</i>
<i>the vehicle's path. I repeat. </i>

01:10:42.005 --> 01:10:45.835
I told you you should have
let me be in the mommy seat.
Just be quiet, okay?

01:10:45.842 --> 01:10:47.542
Whoa!

01:10:47.544 --> 01:10:49.384
My goodness,
look out, look out!
MAN: Whoa, easy!

01:10:49.379 --> 01:10:50.879
LIZ: <i> Look out,</i>
<i>comin' through! (static)</i>

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.750
<i>Sorry! </i>

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:55.449
Whoa!
<i> The pond, to the right,</i>
<i> to the right, to the right!</i>

01:10:55.452 --> 01:10:57.022
<i> Right, right,</i>
<i> right, right, right! </i>

01:10:59.521 --> 01:11:00.991
LIZ: <i> (groans) </i>

01:11:02.691 --> 01:11:04.491
MONICA: (groaning)
LIZ: <i> Monica... </i>

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:08.798
<i> It's stuck! </i>
Okay, well, push harder.

01:11:08.798 --> 01:11:10.668
LIZ: Pushing!
Just push it harder!

01:11:10.667 --> 01:11:11.667
LIZ: I am!

01:11:11.668 --> 01:11:13.868
Kyle?

01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:17.910
Listen, I am really glad
you're here, I've been
meaning to talk to you.

01:11:17.907 --> 01:11:20.577
Now's not a good time, Kyle.
No, look...

01:11:20.577 --> 01:11:22.337
I might have made
a mistake with Ashley,
you know? She's...

01:11:22.345 --> 01:11:25.605
She's a little
difficult, but...

01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:29.645
You know, I just, I was hoping
you'd still be my date tonight.
Wow.

01:11:29.653 --> 01:11:32.953
Kyle...I--I don't
know what to say.

01:11:32.956 --> 01:11:35.916
<i> I do. </i>
KYLE: (scoffs) Dude!

01:11:38.794 --> 01:11:42.864
KYLE: Look, I don't want
any trouble, okay?
Lady, no "man-girdle."

01:11:42.866 --> 01:11:44.866
Kyle! Hello?

01:11:44.868 --> 01:11:49.438
Look, we're losing our lighting,
we need to take pictures now!

01:11:50.673 --> 01:11:51.673
Monica?

01:11:51.675 --> 01:11:53.935
What are you doing here?

01:11:53.943 --> 01:11:56.013
Nice to see you too, Ashley.

01:11:56.012 --> 01:11:59.082
So what do you say, babe?
Be my date again? Huh?

01:12:00.716 --> 01:12:03.616
What?
But you're my date!
And she's...

01:12:04.887 --> 01:12:09.487
Riding a bicycle.
With the old lady
from the mall.

01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:13.862
(scoffs) Oh, did I hear
that correctly, Monica?
Mm-hmm.

01:12:13.863 --> 01:12:18.033
Did she just call me old?
You know what?
I believe she did.

01:12:18.034 --> 01:12:20.574
(growls) That's not good.

01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:24.770
No, it wasn't me, it was her!
No, I think
she meant, "seasoned."

01:12:24.774 --> 01:12:26.644
(gasps)
'Cause you're not
that old.

01:12:28.043 --> 01:12:30.683
Don't make me do
"The Macarena" again.
Yeah.

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:32.010
ASHLEY: What are you doing?

01:12:33.048 --> 01:12:35.718
Oh!
ASHLEY: No! (squeals)

01:12:35.719 --> 01:12:36.949
BOTH: (screams)

01:12:45.694 --> 01:12:48.104
Wait, Sierra! There!
(gasps) Go!

01:12:49.031 --> 01:12:50.401
(siren wailing)

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:52.770
(gasps)

01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:55.640
LIZ: (grunts)

01:12:57.039 --> 01:12:59.669
MONICA: I just need
your makeup.
But you're a winter!

01:12:59.676 --> 01:13:01.806
My makeup just
washes you out!
We know, earlier we--

01:13:01.811 --> 01:13:03.851
Never mind, I just
need your clutch.

01:13:03.847 --> 01:13:06.807
(sighing) Oh, oh, okay.

01:13:06.816 --> 01:13:08.516
Okay, how did that
get in there?

01:13:08.518 --> 01:13:10.948
Long story. How much
time do we have?
Just enough.

01:13:10.954 --> 01:13:12.024
Okay.
Let's go.

01:13:13.789 --> 01:13:14.959
LIZ: And remember, this guy's
not messing around, okay?

01:13:14.958 --> 01:13:16.488
Just follow my lead.
MONICA: I'll be okay.

01:13:16.493 --> 01:13:17.763
LIZ: We'll get your dad.

01:13:17.761 --> 01:13:20.431
LIZ: Look! Look,
there's a door.

01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:22.530
LIZ: Bingo.
( clanging )

01:13:32.574 --> 01:13:36.884
MONICA: You know, we could still
take the diamond to the cops.
Let them help?

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:41.850
LIZ: No. No way, okay? I know
this guy Pierce. All right?
He's not messing around.

01:13:41.851 --> 01:13:44.851
LIZ: This is the best way
to protect your dad.

01:13:44.854 --> 01:13:47.594
MONICA: Um, you got
a little...
LIZ: Yeah, okay.

01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:50.630
MONICA: Yeah, but then you'd
get to march in the station
with the diamond.

01:13:50.627 --> 01:13:52.887
LIZ: Well, yeah.
MONICA: You know,
like you've always wanted?

01:13:52.896 --> 01:13:58.996
LIZ: Yeah. Be pretty great
to see the look on the chief's
face, wouldn't it? But no.

01:13:59.002 --> 01:14:02.842
If you hate the chief so much
then why don't you just transfer
to a different department?

01:14:02.839 --> 01:14:04.569
'Cause I can't escape her.

01:14:04.574 --> 01:14:08.044
She's like a giant tarantula
on my back, sucking out my soul.

01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:13.112
She's my mom.
Whoa, really?

01:14:13.116 --> 01:14:14.176
Yeah.

01:14:15.184 --> 01:14:17.824
Wow, that, um...

01:14:17.821 --> 01:14:19.021
That must be tough

01:14:19.022 --> 01:14:20.722
Yeah, you have no idea.

01:14:20.723 --> 01:14:23.123
I am fifth generation cop.

01:14:23.126 --> 01:14:27.026
My grad-dad always
pushed my mom to
be the best, and she was.

01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:31.230
But now she's on my back every
day, pushing me to be the best.

01:14:31.234 --> 01:14:33.034
Pointing out every mistake.

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:38.170
That...actually sounds
kind of refreshing.

01:14:38.174 --> 01:14:40.784
Uh, "refreshing" isn't
the word I would use.

01:14:41.844 --> 01:14:45.754
It's like, I--I love
my dad, but...

01:14:45.748 --> 01:14:48.678
I'm only just "perfect"
in his eyes, you know?

01:14:48.685 --> 01:14:51.685
I don't know, let me
try that on for size.

01:14:51.688 --> 01:14:53.888
"Hey, Liz! You're perfect!"
"Oh, wow, thank you"

01:14:53.890 --> 01:14:57.160
I think that feels
pretty great, Monica. I don't
know what you're talkin' about.

01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:01.000
Yeah, but, if someone's only
telling you how
great you are, then...

01:15:00.997 --> 01:15:03.257
How do you know when...

01:15:03.266 --> 01:15:04.826
you're not great?

01:15:06.268 --> 01:15:10.098
I mean, sometimes...

01:15:12.241 --> 01:15:14.841
you need a mom...

01:15:14.844 --> 01:15:16.284
telling you the truth.

01:15:18.914 --> 01:15:22.824
That's...probably why
I'm always asking everyone's
opinion on things.

01:15:23.886 --> 01:15:27.216
So you can be
"perfect" after all.

01:15:29.791 --> 01:15:32.931
So people won't
leave you.

01:15:32.929 --> 01:15:35.229
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:15:35.231 --> 01:15:36.801
Something like that.

01:15:39.968 --> 01:15:43.868
Well, if I was your mom...

01:15:48.777 --> 01:15:53.877
If I was your mom,
I would tell you...

01:15:53.883 --> 01:15:57.653
that who you are today...

01:15:57.654 --> 01:16:01.064
is way more interesting
than "perfect" will ever be.

01:16:04.993 --> 01:16:06.933
Monica, you're such
a great kid. (stammers)

01:16:08.964 --> 01:16:11.134
You're such a great kid.

01:16:11.134 --> 01:16:12.204
And...

01:16:12.201 --> 01:16:14.971
the people who are
worth keeping?

01:16:14.971 --> 01:16:16.701
Right? They're always
gonna be around.

01:16:16.706 --> 01:16:19.306
'Kay, look at me.
They've always
been there for me.

01:16:19.309 --> 01:16:22.139
As difficult as I may be.
I mean, that's questionable.
(laughs)

01:16:22.145 --> 01:16:25.205
You know, like, my mom, Ed,
they've always been there.

01:16:28.984 --> 01:16:32.994
They've always been there.
Wow, they've always been there.

01:16:35.324 --> 01:16:37.934
Let's go rescue your dad.
Yeah.

01:16:39.328 --> 01:16:43.858
LIZ: Okay. Now remember,
the most important thing--

01:16:43.866 --> 01:16:44.996
Hello?!

01:16:45.001 --> 01:16:47.971
...is the element of surprise.

01:16:47.971 --> 01:16:49.041
Sorry.

01:16:49.038 --> 01:16:50.808
Uh, I c-- I'm sorry.

01:16:50.807 --> 01:16:53.107
PIERCE:
Hello, ladies!

01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:55.379
Care to join me?!

01:16:55.378 --> 01:16:58.008
LIZ: Get your walkin' shoes on.

01:16:58.014 --> 01:17:00.214
PIERCE: These gizmos...

01:17:00.216 --> 01:17:03.246
never cease to amaze,
do they?

01:17:03.252 --> 01:17:09.292
You can watch
British Premier League football,
live, right in your lap!

01:17:09.292 --> 01:17:12.692
It's just...amazing.

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:21.003
Good evening, Lieutenant.

01:17:21.004 --> 01:17:24.314
Or should I say disgraced,
former Lieutenant?

01:17:24.307 --> 01:17:28.307
Ha ha ha, see?
That just cracks me up, y'know,

01:17:28.311 --> 01:17:33.211
because that, coming from a guy
who gave a $7 million diamond

01:17:33.216 --> 01:17:34.946
to a complete
and utter stranger.

01:17:36.652 --> 01:17:38.822
Where's my diamond?

01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:43.260
I think we can both agree
that I have

01:17:43.259 --> 01:17:47.659
the more
valuable collateral here,
so please, after you.

01:17:49.231 --> 01:17:51.371
( whispering )
Give him the diamond.
It's okay.

01:18:04.946 --> 01:18:08.316
Now give me my dad.

01:18:08.317 --> 01:18:10.017
Oh, Monica.

01:18:11.853 --> 01:18:14.993
Monica, Monica, Monica.

01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:20.032
You didn't just expect me
to hand him over, did you?

01:18:20.029 --> 01:18:23.459
What sort
of incompetent criminal
do you think I am?

01:18:23.466 --> 01:18:27.326
Make no mistake,
you will get your dad back.
Absolutely.

01:18:28.336 --> 01:18:29.836
I'll send you a text message

01:18:29.839 --> 01:18:32.809
with his precise location, soon,

01:18:32.809 --> 01:18:36.879
from some safe, unnamed place,
with warm weather.

01:18:36.879 --> 01:18:39.209
Until then? <i> Au revoir.</i>

01:18:41.116 --> 01:18:42.176
Y'know something, Liz?

01:18:42.185 --> 01:18:43.845
What's that, Monica?

01:18:43.853 --> 01:18:45.893
For the world's
best diamond thief,

01:18:45.888 --> 01:18:47.018
guy's kind of an idiot.

01:18:47.023 --> 01:18:50.063
I--right? Am I right?
Total idiot.

01:18:50.059 --> 01:18:52.929
Exactly--what exactly
do you mean by that?

01:18:52.929 --> 01:18:55.299
It's the 21st century.
It is.

01:18:55.298 --> 01:18:57.198
I know exactly
where my dad is.

01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:59.830
She does.
Go get your dad, honey.

01:18:59.836 --> 01:19:00.966
Dad!

01:19:03.338 --> 01:19:06.868
Dad! Oh, Dad,
I got you, I got you,
I got you.

01:19:09.077 --> 01:19:10.137
Hold on.

01:19:11.079 --> 01:19:12.149
But how?

01:19:13.081 --> 01:19:14.521
How did you do that?

01:19:14.517 --> 01:19:15.777
Who is this creep?

01:19:15.785 --> 01:19:17.115
He's just a low-life

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:20.790
who's going to jail
for a long, long time.

01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:21.860
What is that?

01:19:23.058 --> 01:19:29.228
Some non-lethal,
high-voltage stunning thingy?

01:19:29.232 --> 01:19:31.232
How adorable.

01:19:31.234 --> 01:19:34.874
Forgive me
if I completely ignore it...

01:19:36.037 --> 01:19:37.807
...and just make my exit.

01:19:37.807 --> 01:19:39.107
Oh, ha!

01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:42.339
Why are you smiling?

01:19:42.345 --> 01:19:44.945
I think it's because
this time...

01:19:44.947 --> 01:19:47.517
...she called
for back-up.
Yeah.

01:19:47.517 --> 01:19:52.417
( police sirens )

01:19:55.123 --> 01:19:57.533
All right,
I need three teams!

01:19:57.527 --> 01:20:00.027
Team One, Team One,
take this exit.

01:20:00.029 --> 01:20:01.529
Team Two, cover my back.

01:20:01.531 --> 01:20:04.401
I want battering ram ready,
let's go!

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:08.300
Well, I guess I'll just
have to make my exit
via the high road.

01:20:11.206 --> 01:20:12.266
Oh, dear.

01:20:13.208 --> 01:20:17.908
( incoherent yelps )

01:20:19.047 --> 01:20:20.007
Where's
my battering ram?

01:20:20.016 --> 01:20:21.376
Move it!

01:20:21.384 --> 01:20:23.054
Wait for my command!

01:20:23.052 --> 01:20:27.252
Enter on my cue!
Three, two, one!

01:20:30.892 --> 01:20:37.062
Ohh...on second thought,
Ed, I have missed you.

01:20:37.066 --> 01:20:42.936
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:20:42.939 --> 01:20:44.509
Ahh.
( laughter )

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:52.375
( police radio )

01:20:54.549 --> 01:20:58.089
( cheering and clapping )

01:21:09.164 --> 01:21:12.074
Lieutenant
Elizabeth Morgan,

01:21:12.068 --> 01:21:14.898
reporting recovery
of stolen goods...

01:21:16.605 --> 01:21:20.065
...and apprehension
of suspected perpetrator.

01:21:20.076 --> 01:21:21.576
Permission
to file a report.

01:21:24.379 --> 01:21:25.949
Book 'im.

01:21:25.948 --> 01:21:27.348
Take 'im,
boys.

01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:29.620
And get that necklace
down to Evidence.

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:32.216
Lieutenant.

01:21:33.521 --> 01:21:35.061
One more thing.

01:21:35.057 --> 01:21:36.117
Yeah?

01:21:41.997 --> 01:21:43.897
You'll need
your badge back.

01:21:46.167 --> 01:21:50.907
( cheering and clapping )

01:21:59.281 --> 01:22:00.411
No!

01:22:03.218 --> 01:22:05.188
Thank you for saving me.

01:22:05.187 --> 01:22:07.687
You really are
an incredible kid,
y'know.

01:22:07.690 --> 01:22:10.060
How can I possibly
go to MIT?

01:22:10.059 --> 01:22:11.959
I mean,
what would you do
without me?

01:22:11.961 --> 01:22:15.501
Oh, now,
that can't be a factor
in your decision.

01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:20.468
Well...I mean...

01:22:20.469 --> 01:22:22.339
...I don't want
to leave you.

01:22:22.338 --> 01:22:26.368
Monica,
that's how I'll know
when I've done my job.

01:22:26.375 --> 01:22:28.105
When you can leave.

01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:30.080
Besides,
I'm not going anywhere!

01:22:30.079 --> 01:22:33.049
I'm right here.
It's four years.

01:22:33.049 --> 01:22:35.279
And if you decide
to stay in Boston,

01:22:35.284 --> 01:22:38.624
or move to New York
or Kathmandu, guess what?

01:22:38.621 --> 01:22:42.291
They need nurses there, too.
I'll be around.

01:22:44.392 --> 01:22:45.632
Thanks, Dad.

01:22:48.296 --> 01:22:49.996
( pager goes off )
Oh!

01:22:52.634 --> 01:22:54.974
LIZ: 'Scuse me,
'scuse me. Hey!

01:22:54.971 --> 01:22:56.741
Look, they have an opening,
let's go.
No, it's okay.

01:22:56.739 --> 01:22:58.409
No, no, no,
you can make it!
There's an opening!

01:22:58.407 --> 01:23:00.007
I'll give you
a police escort!

01:23:00.009 --> 01:23:03.139
Forget it.
After everything
that happened today,

01:23:03.145 --> 01:23:05.045
prom just doesn't seem
that important.

01:23:05.047 --> 01:23:07.577
Look, it's prom, okay?
You have to go.

01:23:07.583 --> 01:23:11.653
Come on!
This is the biggest night
of your high school career!

01:23:13.054 --> 01:23:16.024
But I don't have
anything to wear.

01:23:16.025 --> 01:23:19.555
Well...follow me.

01:23:23.732 --> 01:23:28.642
Welcome to the coolest
department store in the city.

01:23:28.637 --> 01:23:29.697
Buzz us in.

01:23:36.344 --> 01:23:39.184
Central Police Station
Evidence Room.

01:23:39.181 --> 01:23:40.451
Wow.

01:23:40.449 --> 01:23:41.449
What is that?

01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:43.080
Can I touch anything?

01:23:43.085 --> 01:23:48.255
Lucky for you,
some criminals
have great taste.

01:23:48.257 --> 01:23:49.657
Oh, yeah, they do.

01:23:51.726 --> 01:23:54.756
¶ Live it up,
whatever you're feeling ¶

01:23:54.764 --> 01:23:57.464
¶ You and I,
clear summer for sailing ¶

01:23:57.466 --> 01:24:00.496
¶ We will go
all over the world ¶

01:24:00.503 --> 01:24:02.103
¶ We will go
all over the world ¶

01:24:02.104 --> 01:24:05.514
¶ Here we go,
it's just the beginning ¶

01:24:05.508 --> 01:24:07.608
¶ Yeah, you and me,
we're spinning ¶

01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:10.410
What do you think?
Do you like it?
What do you think?

01:24:12.113 --> 01:24:15.283
Wow. I mean, wow.

01:24:16.751 --> 01:24:19.591
I think
the real question is,
what do you think?

01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:24.060
I like it.
I love it.

01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:25.760
I really
like it.
It even works
with the hat.

01:24:25.761 --> 01:24:27.761
I know, right?

01:24:27.763 --> 01:24:30.063
But there's
something missing.

01:24:30.066 --> 01:24:33.366
What?
It's missing,
just a little,
I don't know,

01:24:33.369 --> 01:24:35.369
just, maybe...

01:24:35.371 --> 01:24:37.141
...a little of this?

01:24:43.812 --> 01:24:46.852
Wow...

01:24:46.849 --> 01:24:51.819
...Oh, my goodness.
Perfect.

01:24:51.821 --> 01:24:53.751
I can't.
It is way
too valuable.

01:24:53.756 --> 01:24:56.116
Well, I mean,
you're gonna need
a full police escort.

01:24:58.293 --> 01:25:00.133
I've never been to prom.

01:25:00.129 --> 01:25:02.829
Oh, you are going
to prom.
I'm going to prom?

01:25:02.832 --> 01:25:04.802
You're going
to prom!
I'm going to prom!

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:08.100
( police sirens )
¶ Live it up,
whatever you're feeling ¶

01:25:08.104 --> 01:25:09.874
¶ You and I,
clear summer for sailing ¶

01:25:09.872 --> 01:25:12.642
¶ We will go
all over the world ¶

01:25:12.641 --> 01:25:14.881
¶ We will go
all over the world ¶

01:25:14.877 --> 01:25:17.847
¶ Here we go,
it's just the beginning ¶

01:25:17.847 --> 01:25:20.847
¶ Yeah, you and me,
we're spinning ¶

01:25:20.850 --> 01:25:23.250
¶ We will go
all over the world ¶

01:25:23.252 --> 01:25:25.822
¶ We will go
all over the world ¶

01:25:25.821 --> 01:25:30.421
¶ And this bright life
illuminates the way ¶
Listen up!

01:25:30.426 --> 01:25:33.356
I want two men
at every entrance,
¶ To a brand new place ¶

01:25:33.362 --> 01:25:36.802
and a full squad inside!
¶ A brand new day ¶

01:25:36.799 --> 01:25:41.339
¶ I don't know what to expect ¶
And keep your eyes
on that necklace!

01:25:41.337 --> 01:25:45.867
¶ Will never be the same,
Live it up,
whatever you're feeling! ¶

01:25:45.875 --> 01:25:47.805
¶ You and I,
clear summer for sailing ¶

01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:50.510
Why, I never thought
I'd live to see the day.

01:25:50.513 --> 01:25:52.483
My daughter in a ball gown.

01:25:52.481 --> 01:25:55.721
Well, it's for official
police business, so...

01:25:59.154 --> 01:26:00.924
Oh, thanks.

01:26:00.923 --> 01:26:02.823
It was just
a little twisted.

01:26:02.825 --> 01:26:07.385
No, I mean,
thanks for everything.

01:26:07.396 --> 01:26:09.856
You're welcome, honey.
¶ You and I,
clear summer for sailing ¶

01:26:09.865 --> 01:26:11.795
Thank you.
¶ We will go
all over the world ¶

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:14.230
¶ We will go
all over the world ¶
Hey.

01:26:14.236 --> 01:26:17.906
¶ Here we go,
it's just the beginning ¶

01:26:17.907 --> 01:26:19.837
You cut your hair!

01:26:19.842 --> 01:26:21.912
Well, uh,
technically, she did.

01:26:21.911 --> 01:26:26.781
Yeah, yeah, I've had
loads of experience.
Chop chop.

01:26:26.782 --> 01:26:27.782
I love it.

01:26:27.783 --> 01:26:30.923
Me too.
You look hot.

01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:33.920
Oh, I almost forgot.
You won.

01:26:33.923 --> 01:26:34.923
What?
What?

01:26:34.924 --> 01:26:36.794
Yeah!
In a landslide.

01:26:36.792 --> 01:26:39.892
News about Kyle
cheating on you
with Ashley went viral.

01:26:39.895 --> 01:26:41.525
Her support collapsed.

01:26:41.530 --> 01:26:44.230
You are Prom Queen!

01:26:44.966 --> 01:26:49.436
Wow! That's, um...wow!

01:26:49.438 --> 01:26:50.938
Group hug!

01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:54.740
Come on, girls,
let's go to prom!

01:26:54.743 --> 01:26:57.743
We're going to prom.
Oh, we're going!

01:26:57.746 --> 01:27:00.906
¶ Here we go,
and it's just the beginning ¶

01:27:00.916 --> 01:27:02.316
¶ Yeah, you and me,
we're spinning ¶
Okay, let's go!

01:27:02.318 --> 01:27:03.748
( clapping and cheering )

01:27:03.752 --> 01:27:05.792
¶ We will go
all over the world ¶

01:27:05.788 --> 01:27:08.488
¶ We will go
all over the world ¶

01:27:08.490 --> 01:27:11.230
Yeah, Monica!

01:27:21.736 --> 01:27:23.836
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

01:27:23.839 --> 01:27:26.639
This is
an incredible honor.

01:27:27.842 --> 01:27:32.312
Wow!
Um, for the past
few weeks,

01:27:32.314 --> 01:27:34.384
this moment
is all I could think about.

01:27:35.917 --> 01:27:39.947
But I woke up
this morning,
and my day

01:27:39.955 --> 01:27:42.485
took a little bit
of a detour.

01:27:42.491 --> 01:27:45.391
You see,
there was this person.

01:27:46.628 --> 01:27:48.858
Sure,
she had terrible style

01:27:48.864 --> 01:27:50.864
and questionable
social skills,

01:27:50.866 --> 01:27:52.796
and sure, she probably
ruined my chance

01:27:52.801 --> 01:27:55.841
to ever legally drive
in the state.
I'm so sorry.

01:27:55.838 --> 01:27:59.538
But she taught me something.

01:28:01.042 --> 01:28:06.012
Something I wanna share
with all of you.

01:28:06.015 --> 01:28:08.845
Whoever you really are,

01:28:08.851 --> 01:28:14.421
it's okay to be that person.

01:28:14.423 --> 01:28:17.423
And you don't have to
put it up for a vote.

01:28:17.426 --> 01:28:21.996
Because perfect, eh,
it's overrated.

01:28:21.997 --> 01:28:24.827
And the people
that really care about you?

01:28:24.833 --> 01:28:26.633
They're not going anywhere.

01:28:29.337 --> 01:28:33.067
And I've decided
to go to MIT next year.

01:28:34.042 --> 01:28:35.612
Oh, yeah, you will!

01:28:36.944 --> 01:28:39.314
Sorry, sorry.

01:28:41.349 --> 01:28:42.579
I'm gonna miss you all.

01:28:43.518 --> 01:28:44.818
So tonight?

01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:47.890
Let's soak it up,
and have a great time.

01:28:47.890 --> 01:28:49.060
Thank you.

01:28:51.826 --> 01:28:53.826
The Fooo:
¶ ALL OVER THE WORLD ¶

01:28:53.829 --> 01:28:56.829
¶ We've got the love
together we can sing it ¶

01:28:56.832 --> 01:29:02.942
¶ All over the world,
all over the world ¶

01:29:02.938 --> 01:29:05.838
¶ We all belong together
we can bring it ¶

01:29:05.841 --> 01:29:08.611
¶ All over the world,
all over the world ¶

01:29:08.610 --> 01:29:12.910
¶ Beat it!
You gotta move,
gotta move like that ¶

01:29:12.915 --> 01:29:14.975
¶ Move like that
to the groove like that ¶

01:29:14.983 --> 01:29:19.853
¶ All over the world,
all over the world ¶

01:29:19.855 --> 01:29:21.885
LIZ: Ed?

01:29:21.890 --> 01:29:23.390
You've--you h-
you are...

01:29:26.961 --> 01:29:28.831
...you have
such great...

01:29:30.131 --> 01:29:31.701
...nostrils.

01:29:37.138 --> 01:29:38.408
Thanks.

01:29:44.045 --> 01:29:47.905
Um, do you, um...

01:29:47.916 --> 01:29:48.976
...do you...

01:29:50.952 --> 01:29:52.152
...do you wanna dance?

01:29:52.154 --> 01:29:54.964
Yeah!
Let's do it.
Okay, great.

01:29:54.957 --> 01:29:55.957
Can I lead?

01:29:55.958 --> 01:29:57.418
Probably not!

01:29:57.426 --> 01:29:58.986
¶ Dance like that
to the beat like that ¶

01:29:58.994 --> 01:30:02.504
¶ We got the love
together we can sing it ¶

01:30:02.498 --> 01:30:07.128
¶ All over the world,
all over the world ¶

01:30:07.136 --> 01:30:11.906
( pop music playing )

01:30:11.907 --> 01:30:15.837
¶ I might try to sleep,
still with the status quo ¶

01:30:15.844 --> 01:30:18.854
¶ I always wonder
if it's all worth it ¶

01:30:18.847 --> 01:30:23.817
Come on!
¶ I turn the thing too much,
too safe and out of touch ¶

01:30:23.819 --> 01:30:25.119
Okay, let's skip
that part real quick.
¶ I'm over waiting for ¶

01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:28.160
¶ something perfect ¶

01:30:28.157 --> 01:30:32.157
( yelling through megaphone )
¶ Everything that could go wrong
did go wrong ¶

01:30:32.161 --> 01:30:36.001
¶ And I could be
freaking out 'cause ¶

01:30:35.998 --> 01:30:39.798
¶ everything that can go wrong
will go wrong ¶

01:30:39.802 --> 01:30:43.742
Oh, oh, sorry!
Okay. Oh...

01:30:43.739 --> 01:30:45.809
Okay, um,
how did that
get in there?

01:30:45.808 --> 01:30:47.768
How much time
do we have?
Just enough.

01:30:47.776 --> 01:30:51.976
Okay.
Oh, we need the...
...'scuse me, we need the...

01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:53.150
...best part of the necklace.
DIRECTOR: One more right away!

01:30:57.452 --> 01:31:00.552
Uhh.

01:31:00.556 --> 01:31:02.686
Push harder.
Yeah, just, um...

01:31:02.691 --> 01:31:07.631
( groaning with effort )
