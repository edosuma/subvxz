00:08.505 --> 00:10.515
Previously on Get Shorty...

00:10.535 --> 00:12.555
I just need to get some sleep.

00:12.575 --> 00:13.615
Oh, Miles isn't coming?

00:13.635 --> 00:15.605
He definitely wants to be here.

00:15.625 --> 00:17.565
It's his fucking job.

00:17.585 --> 00:19.051
What's wrong with him?

00:19.067 --> 00:21.535
I told you he's acting weird.

00:21.555 --> 00:23.219
'Cause he's high.

00:23.230 --> 00:25.605
You know, stay with him until the
red carpet. Keep an eye on him.

00:25.625 --> 00:26.585
Help!

00:26.605 --> 00:28.535
Somebody, help me!

00:29.605 --> 00:31.455
It was an accident.

00:31.475 --> 00:33.595
I never want to see you again.

00:33.615 --> 00:35.535
Don't do that, Tia, please.

00:35.555 --> 00:37.605
This was a business partner from ours.

00:37.625 --> 00:39.545
This was a lover.

00:39.565 --> 00:42.135
We just want to make sure that
you're being looked after.

00:42.202 --> 00:44.122
So this button here,

00:44.635 --> 00:46.595
is a recording device.

00:46.615 --> 00:47.647
Can I trust you?

00:48.758 --> 00:49.788
Yeah.

00:51.565 --> 00:54.455
Things you've lost, gone forever.

00:55.069 --> 00:56.635
Everything else,

00:56.655 --> 00:58.565
all you have to do is clip.

01:01.625 --> 01:03.625
Did Ginny check out this morning?

01:03.645 --> 01:05.605
Do you know her last name?

01:05.625 --> 01:08.605
Yeah, I'm calling about
a novel you published.

01:08.625 --> 01:10.106
Wilderness.

01:10.117 --> 01:12.515
I'd like to know if
the film rights are available.

01:13.155 --> 01:14.605
I'm a producer.

01:14.625 --> 01:16.675
I have been apologizing to you

01:16.758 --> 01:18.605
since the day we met.

01:18.625 --> 01:20.675
But that's done.

01:21.455 --> 01:22.605
And if you want to
go to war over our kid,

01:22.625 --> 01:25.535
I will make it uglier than
you can fucking imagine.

01:40.665 --> 01:43.585
Tonight, new details on the tragic death

01:43.605 --> 01:44.635
of Max Kisbye.

01:44.655 --> 01:47.505
As Showbiz Daily starts right now.

01:47.525 --> 01:48.645
Welcome to Showbiz Daily.

01:48.665 --> 01:49.665
I'm Benny Cortez.

01:49.675 --> 01:52.455
And I am Brooklyn McGowan Hughes.

01:52.475 --> 01:55.525
Did his demanding role in
the upcoming period romance,

01:55.545 --> 01:56.655
The Admiral's Mistress,

01:56.675 --> 01:59.535
lead to Max Kisbye's
desolate final days,

01:59.555 --> 02:01.535
and the self-inflicted gunshot wound

02:01.555 --> 02:02.977
that ended his life?

02:03.001 --> 02:06.455
We turned to Showbiz Daily's own Dr.
Pearl for the answer.

02:06.475 --> 02:08.555
The details of Max Kisbye's recent past

02:08.574 --> 02:10.555
paint the picture of a man in conflict.

02:10.574 --> 02:12.505
We know from tabloid reports

02:12.525 --> 02:13.645
he was just of rehab.

02:13.665 --> 02:16.475
But then Kisbye jumps
right into the shoes

02:16.495 --> 02:19.575
of a dark, brooding character,
"this is Kisbye,"

02:19.595 --> 02:22.545
head down hours before
taking his own life.

02:22.565 --> 02:24.515
Something has taken a toll on him.

02:24.535 --> 02:28.545
That something could be his
portrayal of Admiral Felton.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.495
In a Showbiz Daily exclusive,

02:30.515 --> 02:32.685
Kisbye's Admiral Mistress's
co-star David Oumou.

02:33.465 --> 02:35.336
Spoke to me and Benny about the tragedy,

02:35.359 --> 02:37.625
and what it was like for David
being thrust into the spotlight.

02:37.645 --> 02:40.585
Is it possible that his role
in The Admiral's Mistress

02:40.605 --> 02:44.465
caused him to relapse and
that in turn led to suicide?

02:44.485 --> 02:46.555
David's heartbreaking answer
in a moment.

02:46.575 --> 02:49.655
But first, as speculation over
Kisbye's death grows,

02:49.675 --> 02:52.515
anticipation for The Admiral's Mistress

02:52.535 --> 02:53.655
grows along with it.

02:53.675 --> 02:56.645
And the actor's curtain call is
teed up to be a hit in theaters,

02:56.665 --> 03:00.575
thanks to millions of highly
emotional Max Kisbye fans.

03:04.455 --> 03:05.615
Check it again.
What the fuck you looking at?

03:05.635 --> 03:08.575
Yago. All right, man,
just check the list.

03:08.595 --> 03:09.965
Check it again.

03:09.976 --> 03:11.980
Sir, if you're not on the list,
I can't let you in.

03:12.021 --> 03:14.472
It's not up to me. Sorry.

03:16.535 --> 03:18.107
Miles Daly and Louis Darnell.

03:18.118 --> 03:20.930
Yo Miles, please tell this puto
with the list to let me in.

03:20.941 --> 03:21.941
I got this.

03:22.057 --> 03:23.465
What do you mean you got this?

03:23.485 --> 03:24.475
Miles, just tell him. Come on, man.

03:24.495 --> 03:25.675
- Don't make a scene.
- Just a minute,

03:26.455 --> 03:27.545
- I talk to her mama.
- Fucked up.

03:27.565 --> 03:28.645
- Ed, come on, it's me.
- Some other time.

03:28.665 --> 03:29.665
Do this for me, Ed.

03:29.675 --> 03:31.685
Come on, man. It's fucking me, Ed.

03:32.465 --> 03:33.615
Come on man.

03:33.699 --> 03:35.397
Come on.

03:35.565 --> 03:36.615
Ed.

03:44.665 --> 03:46.625
This the buyer?

03:46.645 --> 03:48.575
- Answer.
- We probably

03:48.595 --> 03:51.465
shouldn't do business here,
right. This man's funeral.

03:55.575 --> 03:57.575
Hey. Rick Moreweather.

03:57.595 --> 03:59.605
Sammy. Sammy, yeah.

03:59.625 --> 04:02.565
Well, I would. But I still
got offers coming in here.

04:02.585 --> 04:04.485
- Hey.
- I got a buyer.

04:04.505 --> 04:06.455
- Okay, good.
- Uh...

04:06.475 --> 04:07.495
Well, is that your best offer?

04:07.515 --> 04:09.675
Condolences, Amara.

04:10.455 --> 04:13.635
And congratulations, since it sounds
like we're gonna sell the movie.

04:13.655 --> 04:15.565
You don't come to premiere.

04:15.585 --> 04:17.675
I was in a terrible car wreck, Amara.

04:18.454 --> 04:19.524
Maybe Louis mentioned it.

04:19.545 --> 04:20.555
That's why I'm so banged up.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.535
You seem okay.

04:24.635 --> 04:27.455
Kind of you to say.

04:27.475 --> 04:29.535
Look, I realize these
circumstances aren't ideal,

04:29.555 --> 04:32.495
but it looks like we're gonna
recoup your investment.

04:33.515 --> 04:34.645
Which is good.

04:37.525 --> 04:39.525
I'm gonna grab some coffee.
You want anything?

04:39.665 --> 04:41.515
All right, then.

04:43.535 --> 04:44.555
I want cucumber.

04:44.575 --> 04:46.535
Ah, how's that even a sandwich?

04:48.535 --> 04:52.495
So, I got reservations at four
different places for tonight,

04:52.515 --> 04:54.585
- so that you can pick your cuisine.
- Um...

04:54.605 --> 04:55.655
- That's fun.
- Um...

04:55.675 --> 04:58.545
And I'm fine with whatever, though.

04:58.565 --> 05:00.665
I'm more interested in dessert.

05:08.605 --> 05:10.655
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I'm just...

05:10.675 --> 05:13.655
We're... We're still
taking bids. So just...

05:13.675 --> 05:15.565
Yeah, give us your best number.

05:15.585 --> 05:17.525
Okay, look forward to it. Bye-bye.

05:17.545 --> 05:18.585
Mr. Moreweather.

05:18.605 --> 05:20.645
Oh, hey, David. David, how you doing?

05:20.665 --> 05:22.505
I wanted to apologize.

05:22.525 --> 05:23.535
At the hotel you said
not to leave Max alone.

05:23.555 --> 05:26.465
Oh, no, no. No, no. Don't take this on.

05:26.485 --> 05:27.665
I didn't realize how serious it was

05:27.685 --> 05:29.565
What are you gonna do? We...

05:29.585 --> 05:31.585
We're gonna salute his memory now.

05:31.605 --> 05:33.505
That's all. And also,

05:33.525 --> 05:35.475
his last appearance on screen

05:35.495 --> 05:37.675
is gonna find a distributor.

05:38.455 --> 05:40.525
So, wherever Max Kisbye is,

05:40.545 --> 05:42.525
I'm sure he's gonna be happy about that.

05:42.545 --> 05:44.465
Yeah.

05:44.485 --> 05:45.635
So you'd, um...

05:45.655 --> 05:48.545
He never said anything
to you about owning a gun?

05:48.565 --> 05:50.147
- No, not at all.
- Yeah

05:50.183 --> 05:51.535
I didn't know about his
drug problem either.

05:51.555 --> 05:53.535
Yeah. Yeah.

05:53.555 --> 05:55.505
Did you think it was kind of weird

05:55.525 --> 05:56.565
the way it all went down?

05:56.585 --> 05:58.565
- Definitely weird. Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:58.585 --> 06:00.635
You didn't sense like he was

06:00.655 --> 06:03.565
being pressured by anyone, or

06:03.585 --> 06:05.465
threatened maybe by someone?

06:05.485 --> 06:07.555
Hey! Hey!

06:07.575 --> 06:09.525
David, you remember, Louis, our writer?

06:09.545 --> 06:10.635
Yeah, lovely to see you.

06:10.655 --> 06:13.675
- Yeah.
- So you havea theory about Kisbye?

06:13.888 --> 06:15.505
I would love to hear that.

06:15.525 --> 06:16.615
What were you saying?
That he was pressured?

06:16.635 --> 06:19.565
No, no. Theory is just...

06:19.585 --> 06:22.505
No, it's hard to come to terms.

06:22.525 --> 06:24.525
You know, he was so alive.

06:24.545 --> 06:27.565
Now what, now he's... I don't know.

06:28.505 --> 06:30.321
Ah. We should go see him.

06:31.845 --> 06:33.555
On behalf of all of us,

06:33.575 --> 06:35.605
whose lives Max touched,

06:35.633 --> 06:40.533
today we say goodbye
to an artist, a friend,

06:40.545 --> 06:42.505
and all around great guy.

06:42.525 --> 06:45.061
The world will long
remember the youngest

06:45.072 --> 06:47.545
child of Mildred and Terrence Kisbye,

06:47.576 --> 06:49.595
as a talented and...

06:49.615 --> 06:50.846
Sad day.

06:50.904 --> 06:52.114
Terrible.

06:53.032 --> 06:55.615
It seemed like such a chirpy chop.

06:55.635 --> 06:57.645
Not at the premiere apparently.

06:57.665 --> 06:59.555
I heard you missed it.

06:59.575 --> 07:00.655
I'm sure you had a reason.

07:00.675 --> 07:02.585
Drove into a telephone pole.

07:04.685 --> 07:06.485
Are you okay?

07:06.505 --> 07:07.595
Your face.

07:07.615 --> 07:09.615
- You should see the telephone pole.
- Shh!

07:12.475 --> 07:14.341
- About the other night.
- We don't have to talk about it.

07:14.465 --> 07:16.575
I was rude and unkind.

07:16.595 --> 07:18.525
I felt bad I had to leave.

07:20.615 --> 07:22.575
But I was rude.

07:23.655 --> 07:24.685
You were.

07:26.635 --> 07:28.505
I hope you can forgive me.

07:30.595 --> 07:31.615
Wasn't a big deal.

07:35.555 --> 07:38.455
After my accident, I ended up
in this little motel.

07:38.475 --> 07:40.505
Look what I found on the shelf.

07:40.525 --> 07:41.605
Um... It's great, right?

07:41.625 --> 07:44.465
It's fucking inspiring.

07:44.485 --> 07:46.525
And it will make a brilliant movie.

07:46.554 --> 07:47.554
Um...

07:47.565 --> 07:49.455
I even called the publishers.

07:49.475 --> 07:51.545
They tell me that the rights
have already been optioned

07:51.565 --> 07:53.525
by you and your boss.

07:53.545 --> 07:55.575
Yes, which is why I was reading it.

07:55.595 --> 07:57.615
I wasn't just reading to,

07:57.635 --> 07:59.505
you know, read.

08:02.892 --> 08:04.525
So are we too late?

08:06.645 --> 08:08.595
There's a script
but it hasn't been set up.

08:08.615 --> 08:11.505
I feel passionately that this
should be my next film, April.

08:11.525 --> 08:13.545
I can see it. I can see the platform...

08:13.565 --> 08:14.675
- Miles!
- ...with this piece of...

08:14.776 --> 08:15.919
Can you just get me into
a room with your boss?

08:15.935 --> 08:17.212
It's dead!

08:20.685 --> 08:22.465
I'm sorry.

08:24.605 --> 08:27.505
Look, it's been to all
the studios, everyone passed.

08:27.525 --> 08:29.495
It's too dark and weird.

08:29.515 --> 08:31.595
Lawrence couldn't even
raise money privately.

08:31.615 --> 08:34.674
So unless you have 30 million
it's not gonna happen.

08:35.455 --> 08:38.475
And telling the world, "break it."

08:38.495 --> 08:39.635
That's the Max Kisbye...

08:39.655 --> 08:41.595
- Can you get me a copy of the script?
- Shh!

08:41.615 --> 08:43.515
- Miles, it's a fucking eulogy.
- All right.

08:43.534 --> 08:45.605
...own path into the hearts of millions.

08:45.625 --> 08:48.475
May God bless Max Kisbye,

08:48.495 --> 08:50.535
and may he rest in eternal peace.

08:50.555 --> 08:52.545
Max died

08:52.565 --> 08:54.455
how he lived,

08:54.475 --> 08:55.655
on his own terms.

08:55.675 --> 08:56.675
Thank you.

08:59.665 --> 09:02.595
Coroner's report isn't out,
but I'll give you a preview.

09:02.615 --> 09:04.555
Well, I was telling
my wife about this room.

09:05.625 --> 09:07.565
She says it goes for 5 grand a night.

09:07.585 --> 09:08.655
I can get a discount now.

09:08.675 --> 09:11.495
But don't tell Jane that.

09:11.515 --> 09:12.575
So, what do we got?

09:12.595 --> 09:14.525
All right. Kisbye was here.

09:14.545 --> 09:16.625
Took a shot to the thigh at close range.

09:16.645 --> 09:19.675
Possible he was pacing
with the gun and it went off.

09:20.455 --> 09:21.675
If so, he was holding them like this.

09:24.565 --> 09:25.605
Second shot

09:25.625 --> 09:26.685
is by the window.

09:29.505 --> 09:31.525
Two inches behind the right ear,

09:31.545 --> 09:33.525
slight upward angle.

09:33.545 --> 09:35.545
Boy, you'd have to be double-jointed.

09:35.565 --> 09:36.907
When I tried to demonstrate it to Greg

09:36.918 --> 09:38.495
earlier, I think I pulled something.

09:38.515 --> 09:39.535
Well, we still have
surveillance to look at.

09:39.555 --> 09:41.615
But for now let's go
with that assumption.

09:42.565 --> 09:43.655
Go with...

09:43.675 --> 09:45.665
That when Kisbye died there
was someone else with him

09:46.635 --> 09:49.595
in this big ostentatious room.

09:51.515 --> 09:52.539
Yeah.

09:53.595 --> 09:54.595
Here, here, here!

10:19.081 --> 10:20.595
Hi, thank you for calling.

10:20.615 --> 10:23.505
There's a detail message... Thanks.

10:23.525 --> 10:26.525
Hi there. I don't know
who I'm calling, um...

10:27.575 --> 10:28.655
My name is Miles Daly.

10:28.675 --> 10:31.535
I got this number
on the back of an old photo.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.115
Long story.

10:33.595 --> 10:35.615
If you could give me
a call back I'd appreciate it.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.595
I was hoping that someone might

10:37.615 --> 10:39.565
shine some light on

10:39.585 --> 10:40.655
anything, really.

10:40.675 --> 10:45.605
I'm at 7751649835.

10:45.625 --> 10:46.625
Thank you.

10:54.555 --> 10:55.635
What's with the ribbon?

10:55.655 --> 10:56.665
Lupus.

10:56.685 --> 10:59.575
Helping organize a walk to end it.

10:59.595 --> 11:01.625
It's about time someone ended it.

11:01.645 --> 11:02.685
With a walk.

11:05.675 --> 11:07.625
You still picking up for pizza tomorrow?

11:09.665 --> 11:11.605
I, uh...

11:11.625 --> 11:14.665
I thought about
what you said the other night.

11:14.685 --> 11:17.575
I get where you're
coming from, Miles. I do.

11:18.625 --> 11:20.675
But I'm still asking for full custody.

11:25.495 --> 11:28.495
You weren't talking
about fighting this in court.

11:30.515 --> 11:32.525
'Cause that wouldn't go well for you.

11:33.595 --> 11:35.535
Don't put me in that position.

11:36.615 --> 11:37.665
Eh. There she is.

11:37.685 --> 11:39.475
Uh, my legs.

11:39.495 --> 11:41.495
You gave it your all.

11:41.515 --> 11:42.585
It's all that matters.

11:42.605 --> 11:44.585
- That and winning.
- Yeah, good talk, Dad.

11:45.575 --> 11:46.665
What happened to your book?

11:46.685 --> 11:48.545
Ah, yeah, I got a bit wet,

11:48.565 --> 11:50.635
I had to use a hair dryer on it.

11:50.655 --> 11:51.685
It's gonna be my next movie,

11:52.465 --> 11:53.545
if I can raise the money.

11:53.565 --> 11:54.595
I have $8.

11:54.615 --> 11:55.665
When can you get it to me?

11:58.505 --> 11:59.605
What's it about?

11:59.625 --> 12:01.485
It's a girl about your age

12:01.505 --> 12:02.685
trying to survive the apocalypse.

12:03.465 --> 12:04.535
Yeah? Can I read it?

12:06.356 --> 12:07.525
Yeah.

12:07.545 --> 12:09.605
You take that. I'll get another copy.

12:09.625 --> 12:12.545
- Thanks.
- I'd love to know what you think, actually.

12:13.595 --> 12:15.455
It's a bookmark.

12:15.635 --> 12:17.485
Okay. Time to go, Em.

12:19.575 --> 12:20.645
I'll text you.

12:20.665 --> 12:22.545
If I have time for her
to see you next week.

12:22.565 --> 12:24.495
How generous of you.

12:24.515 --> 12:25.565
- Bye.
- Bye.

12:28.455 --> 12:29.535
Love you, shorty.

12:30.060 --> 12:31.517
Love you, too.

12:39.233 --> 12:40.725
You smell that?

12:40.736 --> 12:43.146
Lapsang soushong.

12:43.157 --> 12:44.665
Gladys got me into it, yeah.

12:44.685 --> 12:47.555
Smells like bacon.

12:47.575 --> 12:49.535
Amara wants you to put this on.

12:51.615 --> 12:52.655
What?

12:52.675 --> 12:54.675
She has a surprise for you.

12:58.655 --> 13:01.655
And... No...

13:01.675 --> 13:04.532
I'm not good with
things on my eyes. I...

13:04.571 --> 13:05.614
I suck at pinatas...

13:05.625 --> 13:07.575
I don't blame you, man.

13:07.595 --> 13:08.645
But it's what she wants.

13:24.575 --> 13:25.665
- Good.
- Okay.

13:25.685 --> 13:26.685
All right.

13:26.685 --> 13:28.555
- Just get going.
- Okay.

13:28.575 --> 13:29.665
All right.

13:31.675 --> 13:32.675
Okay.

13:40.505 --> 13:41.505
Okay.

13:43.685 --> 13:46.575
Surprise for my Ricky.

13:47.575 --> 13:49.565
- You like it?
- Ooh!

13:50.475 --> 13:51.505
Ooh.

13:51.525 --> 13:53.545
That's a lot to like. So...

13:54.615 --> 13:55.665
This is the surprise?

13:56.455 --> 13:57.555
You sell my movie,

13:57.575 --> 13:59.615
I want to get you something nice.

13:59.635 --> 14:01.525
65 jets.

14:01.545 --> 14:03.585
It's like a cauldron.

14:04.655 --> 14:06.575
Thank you.

14:06.595 --> 14:08.505
You want to get in?

14:08.525 --> 14:09.605
Not with the guys here.

14:09.625 --> 14:11.495
Leave us.

14:12.465 --> 14:13.545
Get undressed.

14:13.565 --> 14:15.605
I'll wait till they're gone.

14:15.625 --> 14:17.605
I want to make it nice for you.

14:17.625 --> 14:19.545
So you don't need to go to your house.

14:19.565 --> 14:21.595
I mean, I hardly go home anyway.

14:21.615 --> 14:22.675
Just to get the mail and...

14:23.455 --> 14:24.515
Why don't you sell it?

14:26.615 --> 14:28.575
Sell... What? My house?

14:28.595 --> 14:30.675
You don't need it, huh?

14:31.455 --> 14:32.525
You're with me.

14:33.217 --> 14:34.267
Well,

14:34.605 --> 14:37.665
I mean, the market's
a little soft right now.

14:50.605 --> 14:52.645
Breaking out the hair gel. Ooh.

14:52.665 --> 14:54.655
Yeah, well.

14:54.675 --> 14:57.645
Hanging out with Gladys, so

14:57.665 --> 14:59.575
I thought I got the extra distance.

14:59.595 --> 15:02.555
So it's the fate of my
unborn child is at stake.

15:02.575 --> 15:05.575
Lovely. So, listen, I spoke with April.

15:05.595 --> 15:07.565
Oh, yeah? Oh, about the book?

15:07.585 --> 15:09.605
It's good news, Lou.

15:09.625 --> 15:11.565
So her boss is gonna
make it into a movie,

15:11.585 --> 15:12.655
but we can still get in on it.

15:12.675 --> 15:14.495
You and me, man.

15:14.515 --> 15:16.625
- Make our next feature.
- Huh! No shit.

15:16.645 --> 15:18.615
They even have a script.

15:18.635 --> 15:21.575
I read her on my phone. It is...

15:21.595 --> 15:23.535
Everything I was hoping it would be it.

15:23.555 --> 15:24.685
It's beautiful and dark,

15:25.465 --> 15:27.685
and different than all the
other shite out there. It's...

15:28.465 --> 15:31.475
It looks... Which is probably
why the studio turned it down.

15:31.495 --> 15:32.565
Which studios?

15:32.585 --> 15:33.605
All of 'em.

15:34.210 --> 15:35.226
So...

15:35.242 --> 15:37.615
Did I tell you about this girl
that I met at the motel I was at?

15:37.635 --> 15:39.475
She was into crystal healing.

15:39.495 --> 15:41.525
Oh, man, people like that.

15:41.545 --> 15:44.575
She told me the past is over,

15:44.595 --> 15:47.505
and the future is right in front of us.

15:47.525 --> 15:49.555
All we have to do
is reach out and grab it.

15:49.575 --> 15:50.645
Yeah, that's bullshit.

15:50.665 --> 15:52.555
No, no, no. See it's not.

15:52.575 --> 15:54.595
- Oh, crap. I thought...
- 'Cause then

15:54.615 --> 15:56.615
I find this book on a shelf.

15:56.635 --> 16:00.625
Turns out it's fucking brilliant.
I mean, what are the chances?

16:00.645 --> 16:02.665
Like, it was just sitting there

16:02.685 --> 16:04.525
waiting for me to pick it up.

16:05.555 --> 16:07.455
Right.

16:07.475 --> 16:08.655
So, what are you saying?

16:08.675 --> 16:11.595
Amara doesn't have the
30 million to make this movie.

16:12.645 --> 16:13.685
So who does?

16:15.685 --> 16:17.555
Who's in the same business

16:17.575 --> 16:18.625
on a bigger scale,

16:20.485 --> 16:23.625
who cleans 30 million
on a regular basis.

16:23.645 --> 16:25.635
Well, I mean, there's LA, but...

16:28.585 --> 16:29.615
Fuck no!

16:29.635 --> 16:31.575
They got hundreds
of shell companies, Lou.

16:31.595 --> 16:33.575
They got bars and laundromats and...

16:33.595 --> 16:36.475
They take people out with chainsaws!

16:36.495 --> 16:38.595
There's an upside and a downside, yes.

16:38.615 --> 16:42.485
But I love that you're
feeling all inspired.

16:42.505 --> 16:43.635
I am.

16:43.655 --> 16:46.515
But advice from a hippie

16:46.535 --> 16:47.555
from some motel

16:47.575 --> 16:49.655
isn't necessarily good advice.

16:50.665 --> 16:52.535
I... I got to run.

16:53.525 --> 16:54.675
What we do is risky, Lou.

16:55.197 --> 16:56.515
This is just a next step.

16:56.535 --> 16:58.555
I... I work for Amara for a decade.

16:58.575 --> 17:00.635
I never got so much a paper cut.

17:00.655 --> 17:03.455
Couple of months of
producing movies, I got shot

17:03.475 --> 17:07.505
five times. Look, look,
see these? These?

17:08.484 --> 17:09.585
Are movie scars.

17:10.605 --> 17:12.545
And I feel shite about that.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.605
We don't know anybody who's with LA.

17:15.415 --> 17:16.515
Yes, we do.

17:17.655 --> 17:19.595
From what I hear he's...

17:19.615 --> 17:21.505
- He's been running with them.
- Who's that?

17:22.675 --> 17:24.454
Yago.

17:29.645 --> 17:31.495
I know how it sounds.

17:31.515 --> 17:32.685
I do. Lou,

17:32.737 --> 17:35.585
if you just hear me out, I've got a
fucking plan, when you hear the...

17:45.605 --> 17:47.555
Hey, man. I don't mean to get on you,

17:47.575 --> 17:49.535
but dishes don't be washing themselves.

17:49.555 --> 17:51.565
I got some girls coming by later.

17:51.585 --> 17:52.655
Are you going clubbing?

17:57.625 --> 17:59.455
Yeah, I get it.

18:00.515 --> 18:02.555
Wouldn't look good to be
seen with me right now.

18:03.625 --> 18:04.645
Right?

18:07.495 --> 18:10.495
You know, my Tia
should be kissing my ass.

18:10.515 --> 18:12.485
If it wasn't for me, Kisbye
would still be alive

18:12.505 --> 18:13.655
and that fucking movie wouldn't be shit.

18:13.675 --> 18:15.535
Yeah? Well, someone should tell her.

18:26.505 --> 18:28.565
You ever thought about your own funeral?

18:30.685 --> 18:32.485
Who would show up.

18:34.635 --> 18:35.869
What they would say.

18:41.565 --> 18:42.645
Are you okay, man?

18:58.708 --> 19:00.613
_

19:10.495 --> 19:11.575
Tired?

19:12.565 --> 19:14.515
No, not at all.

19:16.555 --> 19:18.515
I yawn when I get nervous.

19:19.535 --> 19:20.595
Why are you nervous?

19:22.060 --> 19:24.555
I'm not nervous, nervous just...

19:26.485 --> 19:28.150
Not about our date.

19:28.182 --> 19:29.525
We've hung out before.

19:30.675 --> 19:32.595
Well, not since we got married.

19:33.635 --> 19:35.862
Oh, I'm not supposed to say that word.

19:35.925 --> 19:39.505
- Sorry.
- Is this about sex?

19:39.525 --> 19:41.615
Are you nervous
'cause we can have sex now?

19:45.495 --> 19:47.455
Oh, come on, it's so sweet.

19:51.565 --> 19:53.575
Should we have sex before
we go and get it over with?

19:53.595 --> 19:55.515
Yeah, that'd work.

20:16.605 --> 20:17.998
Ms. De Escalones.

20:18.014 --> 20:19.565
Thank you for waiting.

20:22.475 --> 20:23.675
I pay you in three days.

20:23.982 --> 20:25.495
Yes, I head.

20:25.515 --> 20:26.605
And let me be the first to say

20:26.625 --> 20:29.535
we appreciate you clearing your debt.

20:29.555 --> 20:32.455
You sent product, yes? Twice a week.

20:34.675 --> 20:39.485
There's been discussion internally
about your history of late payments.

20:39.505 --> 20:40.575
It's not personal.

20:40.595 --> 20:43.465
It's a liability issue
for my organization.

20:43.485 --> 20:44.685
- What issue?
- Moving forward,

20:45.465 --> 20:48.605
we require an additional 5%
of gross earnings.

20:51.565 --> 20:52.585
This a joke?

20:53.555 --> 20:54.575
It is not.

20:54.675 --> 20:56.455
5%?

20:58.645 --> 21:00.655
You like fucking with me, eh?

21:00.675 --> 21:03.515
I didn't reach this decision alone.

21:03.535 --> 21:05.595
My feelings have nothing to do with it.

21:05.615 --> 21:08.505
Congratulations on your
return to solvency.

21:09.555 --> 21:11.485
Eat shit.

21:11.505 --> 21:14.515
Oh, and for obvious reasons,

21:14.535 --> 21:15.685
we need you to pay upfront.

21:34.665 --> 21:36.645
Ever had an orgasm before?

21:38.505 --> 21:40.465
I didn't have them when I was awake.

21:40.655 --> 21:43.485
I mean, the whole...

21:43.505 --> 21:46.575
Moving thing, that just takes
it to a whole another level.

21:46.595 --> 21:48.475
- It does, right?
- Yeah.

21:50.605 --> 21:53.455
Let's not take soaking
off the menu though.

21:53.675 --> 21:55.525
It's salty.

22:01.525 --> 22:04.635
That surfing accident
did a number on you.

22:04.655 --> 22:08.515
Well, it's... Where I was surfing

22:08.535 --> 22:12.545
had big waves and rocks. Lot of rocks.

22:12.565 --> 22:13.665
Hmm.

22:13.685 --> 22:15.545
Do scars bother you?

22:16.575 --> 22:18.475
I like a man with scars.

22:22.635 --> 22:25.455
So, you still want to go out

22:25.475 --> 22:26.605
or should we just, you know,

22:26.625 --> 22:28.455
cozy in for the night?

22:33.575 --> 22:34.635
What?

22:34.655 --> 22:38.485
It's just... If we were
regular dating, which we are,

22:38.505 --> 22:39.655
you wouldn't expect to spend a night.

22:43.525 --> 22:44.665
You're right.

22:44.685 --> 22:46.515
Yep. You're right.

22:46.685 --> 22:48.625
Yeah, we'll just,

22:48.645 --> 22:50.625
you know, grab dinner tomorrow.

22:50.645 --> 22:52.535
I can't tomorrow. I got a date.

22:53.495 --> 22:54.635
How can you have a date?

22:55.685 --> 22:57.535
- We're...
- Dating!

22:58.515 --> 22:59.595
And if we're dating

22:59.615 --> 23:01.625
this is way too early to be exclusive.

23:01.645 --> 23:02.675
Well, I just kind of, sort of thought

23:03.455 --> 23:05.525
that maybe, you know,
since we're married...

23:05.545 --> 23:07.465
We don't say that word!

23:13.575 --> 23:16.515
Well, I guess since you're going
on a date, I'll just go home.

23:18.066 --> 23:19.136
Okay.

23:19.545 --> 23:20.685
Had an awesome time tonight.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.615
Okay. Well,

23:25.635 --> 23:29.555
hope you and my baby
have fun on your date.

23:35.485 --> 23:36.565
Mmm.

23:36.585 --> 23:38.605
Let's get another,
I've got a fellow joining me.

24:01.615 --> 24:03.565
I got you your usual.

24:05.685 --> 24:08.495
So you wanna laugh at my face?

24:08.515 --> 24:09.525
That's what this is.

24:10.202 --> 24:11.282
Hey.

24:11.595 --> 24:14.455
Amara is none too fond of me
at the moment either.

24:15.485 --> 24:16.555
She doesn't know we're talking?

24:16.575 --> 24:17.575
No.

24:18.565 --> 24:21.006
So I'd rather not shout.

24:21.045 --> 24:22.625
Maybe you could sit down.

24:35.615 --> 24:37.665
I'm making another movie.

24:37.685 --> 24:39.585
Good for you.

24:39.605 --> 24:42.575
It needs to be privately financed

24:42.595 --> 24:44.545
like I did with Amara.

24:44.565 --> 24:46.675
But we need more than
Amara can contribute.

24:48.239 --> 24:49.239
So?

24:49.545 --> 24:51.465
How close are you with LA?

24:54.565 --> 24:56.535
Oh, shit.

24:56.555 --> 24:58.535
You want me to make an introduction?

25:01.495 --> 25:02.497
That's funny.

25:02.608 --> 25:03.645
Can you do it?

25:03.665 --> 25:06.485
Can I? Of course I can.

25:06.505 --> 25:07.555
But I won't.

25:08.525 --> 25:09.655
Why is that?

25:09.675 --> 25:11.525
Because fuck you.

25:12.987 --> 25:14.495
That's why.

25:17.455 --> 25:19.465
Well, thanks for clearing that up.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.595
You know, everybody thinks

25:22.615 --> 25:25.605
that blazing clipper
got taken out by LA.

25:27.535 --> 25:29.665
But you, you know what really happened.

25:34.121 --> 25:35.615
You wanna know what I think?

25:35.635 --> 25:38.105
I think Amara didn't
like the idea of you

25:38.116 --> 25:40.515
and your buddies stirring up trouble.

25:40.535 --> 25:44.475
She might not harm you,
but the other two?

25:44.495 --> 25:46.525
Well...

25:46.545 --> 25:48.585
So you gonna put the
whole thing on my Tia.

25:48.605 --> 25:49.665
I don't know.

25:50.625 --> 25:51.655
Do I?

25:52.615 --> 25:54.595
All I can do is speculate.

25:57.545 --> 26:00.645
You think I'm suggesting
we become best buds?

26:00.665 --> 26:04.495
Go to the fucking day spa together
and get our hair braided?

26:04.515 --> 26:06.455
This is business.

26:06.475 --> 26:08.645
You are a good businessman.

26:08.665 --> 26:10.515
I've seen that.

26:12.585 --> 26:14.595
Fuck it. If you're not interested

26:15.555 --> 26:17.485
I'll find someone who is.

26:27.854 --> 26:31.655
If... If I decide to do it...

26:33.595 --> 26:34.615
What do I get?

26:37.555 --> 26:39.555
Amara can't know you're involved.

26:39.575 --> 26:41.615
But if everything goes to plan,

26:41.635 --> 26:43.595
you get what she gets.

26:46.086 --> 26:47.655
While you're thinking it all over,

26:47.675 --> 26:51.545
please try that drink,
it's fucking delicious.

27:05.147 --> 27:06.545
Stetson or campaign?

27:07.635 --> 27:09.665
Well, Campaign goes with the uniform.

27:09.685 --> 27:11.505
I know.

27:11.525 --> 27:12.675
Except I look like a park ranger.

27:13.605 --> 27:14.645
So, Stetson.

27:14.665 --> 27:16.475
Also there's two feds in the hallway.

27:18.495 --> 27:19.495
What?

27:23.665 --> 27:27.515
The Bureau is descending
on Santa Barbara.

27:27.535 --> 27:29.625
Just us two. I'm Agent Dillard.

27:29.645 --> 27:31.575
Agent Stevenson.

27:31.595 --> 27:33.555
- Okay.
- So what's this about?

27:33.575 --> 27:35.545
Well, your department was kind enough

27:35.565 --> 27:36.635
to share information.

27:36.655 --> 27:37.655
Excellent police work.

27:37.655 --> 27:39.515
And with a lot of media watching.

27:39.535 --> 27:41.465
Well, I'm just a dog with a bone.

27:41.485 --> 27:43.495
And we know you're
planning to go public?

27:43.515 --> 27:44.645
It could be a 187,

27:44.665 --> 27:46.605
so we're gonna put that out,
see what we get back.

27:46.625 --> 27:50.093
Sheriff, we would be honored
to work with you on this.

27:50.284 --> 27:52.274
- With the Bureau?
- Not that you need our help.

27:52.294 --> 27:53.174
Obviously.

27:53.185 --> 27:54.537
But if we could, um,

27:56.434 --> 27:59.153
trust you with a big Uncle Sam secret,

27:59.244 --> 28:02.129
this is a part of a larger
federal investigation.

28:02.244 --> 28:05.444
So, until we can make it air-tight
and prove there's a homicide,

28:05.464 --> 28:08.274
which I have no doubt you will do.

28:08.294 --> 28:10.304
Till then, we can't alert the media.

28:11.244 --> 28:12.384
Oh, shit.

28:12.404 --> 28:14.334
Ah, well, but I'm afraid
you're a little late.

28:14.354 --> 28:16.364
We have a news conference
in less than...

28:16.384 --> 28:17.454
- We called it off.
- Yeah.

28:17.474 --> 28:19.334
So you don't have to worry.

28:19.354 --> 28:21.264
And can I say.

28:21.284 --> 28:22.394
- Yeah.
- That is a great hat.

28:24.237 --> 28:26.264
Yeah.

28:26.284 --> 28:27.414
Yeah, all of that.

28:27.434 --> 28:30.344
On one level it's a thriller
with action and all that.

28:30.364 --> 28:32.344
But it's got deeper meaning.

28:32.364 --> 28:33.836
Like you can watch it two or three times

28:33.847 --> 28:35.344
and always find something new in it.

28:35.364 --> 28:37.334
Hey, wait a minute.
You got financing ready?

28:37.354 --> 28:39.274
Yeah, I know how to get it.

28:39.294 --> 28:40.394
But it's not from Amara.

28:40.414 --> 28:42.274
She'll be a producer.

28:42.294 --> 28:43.454
Who's giving you 30 million?

28:43.474 --> 28:46.304
A private investor.

28:46.324 --> 28:48.314
Who? Who are they?
What business they in?

28:48.334 --> 28:51.434
They have a portfolio and different
sources of income and what-not.

28:51.454 --> 28:53.244
Yeah? How do you know them?

28:53.264 --> 28:54.588
They do some business with Amara.

28:55.454 --> 28:56.474
Look,

28:57.254 --> 28:59.364
Amara's gonna wanna be involved.

28:59.384 --> 29:01.354
And when she finds out that
someone else is financing,

29:01.374 --> 29:03.073
that's when you come in.

29:03.084 --> 29:04.084
All you need to do is tell her

29:04.096 --> 29:05.128
she can be an executive producer

29:05.264 --> 29:07.404
and wouldn't have to invest a penny.

29:07.424 --> 29:08.454
Well, you tell her that.

29:08.474 --> 29:11.324
She, uh, she trusts you, doesn't she?

29:12.424 --> 29:13.573
Yeah.

29:13.584 --> 29:16.677
So these investors,
they're friends of Amara's?

29:17.424 --> 29:20.570
- Not friends.
- Associates.

29:21.384 --> 29:25.324
Huh. Like her,
but just on a bigger level.

29:25.344 --> 29:27.444
What we did with the Admiral's Mistress,

29:27.464 --> 29:29.474
no different than that.

29:30.254 --> 29:32.284
You know what, I would do this. I would.

29:32.304 --> 29:33.434
But I got projects of my own now

29:33.454 --> 29:35.264
that I'm dealing with
and I'm not gonna have time.

29:35.284 --> 29:36.424
Remember what you told me.

29:36.444 --> 29:39.334
You said it's good to have
irons in the fire.

29:39.354 --> 29:41.394
- I don't think I said that.
- Yes, you did.

29:42.464 --> 29:44.414
I don't think I did. But anyway, look,

29:44.434 --> 29:46.424
you and me, we'll do something
but not this, okay? I got to go.

29:46.444 --> 29:48.324
Why don't you hold on to that?

29:48.344 --> 29:50.254
Just, uh, think it over.

29:50.274 --> 29:51.324
Good seeing you.

29:51.344 --> 29:52.444
I'll be calling you, Rick.

30:03.354 --> 30:05.324
Yeah. Well, don't judge
a book by its cover

30:05.344 --> 30:07.042
unless you have a tremendous
instinct about book covers.

30:07.081 --> 30:08.294
He's offering one year.

30:08.314 --> 30:10.444
Anything under 18 months
is throwing money away.

30:10.464 --> 30:11.474
Stephen Frears.

30:12.254 --> 30:13.274
Yeah.

30:13.294 --> 30:14.334
Hey, how's your first week going?

30:14.354 --> 30:15.354
Getting all settled in?

30:15.374 --> 30:17.414
Yeah, I was actually just

30:17.434 --> 30:19.254
- getting used...
- Have I mentioned Steven Frears?

30:19.274 --> 30:21.364
Okay. Well, explain
the ramifications of an Oscar

30:21.384 --> 30:23.344
to your client and call me back.

30:23.363 --> 30:24.993
All right. Okay, ciao.

30:25.049 --> 30:26.364
- Benicio.
- Let's get his stuff on a hundred days.

30:26.384 --> 30:28.434
- Amelo.
- Um, tell him happy birthday.

30:28.454 --> 30:30.374
- Clock is ticking for Fireman's Ball.
- No.

30:30.394 --> 30:31.424
We don't want him spooked.

30:32.364 --> 30:34.414
Prune?

30:34.434 --> 30:37.314
- I'm good.
- Mmm-hmm. Have a seat.

30:43.334 --> 30:45.354
April Quinn.

30:45.374 --> 30:48.454
Is that Irish?
It's anglicized from O'Cune?

30:49.464 --> 30:51.364
Yes, it is, actually.

30:54.233 --> 30:56.073
So.

30:56.115 --> 30:59.294
Yes. Um... I wanted to
update you on Wilderness.

30:59.314 --> 31:00.424
I know it's a tough one to set up.

31:00.444 --> 31:02.404
- Yeah, pass that.
- And not just...

31:02.424 --> 31:06.264
Talk with Gillian Flynn, our galleys
drop tonight at 10:00. Read 'em.

31:06.284 --> 31:08.384
And let me know
if we should get the rights.

31:08.404 --> 31:11.006
Wow! Yeah, I love Gillian Flynn.

31:11.254 --> 31:12.304
I'll call you midnight.

31:12.324 --> 31:16.314
- Okay.
- Oh, right, cool director.

31:16.334 --> 31:19.284
Marlin, can you give me
contents people, please.

31:21.870 --> 31:22.890
Yes.

31:22.901 --> 31:26.254
Sorry. It says the book is 600 pages.

31:26.274 --> 31:28.434
You want me to read that in two hours?

31:28.454 --> 31:29.454
Yes, I do.

31:30.334 --> 31:31.334
Thank you.

31:32.294 --> 31:33.349
Thank you.

31:37.414 --> 31:39.374
Yeah, Naomi.

31:39.394 --> 31:40.444
That's yours.

31:44.414 --> 31:48.284
Mmm... Pizza from
the Target in Paramount.

31:48.304 --> 31:50.394
I think it's better.

31:50.414 --> 31:52.454
Huh!

31:55.404 --> 31:56.424
Yeah.

31:56.449 --> 31:57.449
Hi.

31:57.474 --> 31:59.294
Hi yourself.

31:59.412 --> 32:00.424
How was your date?

32:00.444 --> 32:02.364
Ah. Just drinks.

32:02.384 --> 32:06.384
Had a seltzer, date was... Whatever.
You want to come over?

32:06.404 --> 32:09.244
Oh, so, your date didn't go well,

32:09.264 --> 32:10.334
so I'm the backup.

32:10.354 --> 32:12.434
I just waltz over
whenever you want me there.

32:12.454 --> 32:14.354
What if I'm on a date?

32:14.374 --> 32:16.771
- So, you're not coming over?
- No, I'm coming over now.

32:19.334 --> 32:20.354
Unbelievable.

32:22.304 --> 32:23.354
He has a girlfriend?

32:24.314 --> 32:25.384
He's complicated.

32:25.404 --> 32:27.274
I'm halfway through Wilderness.

32:27.294 --> 32:29.284
- Already? What do you think?
- I love it.

32:29.304 --> 32:31.244
Know when they were hiding
in the underpass?

32:31.264 --> 32:32.374
Ask Mom, I was shrieking.

32:32.394 --> 32:34.304
Shrieking is good, is it?

32:34.324 --> 32:36.254
That reminds me of The Six but better.

32:36.274 --> 32:38.314
- What's that?
- Western.

32:40.264 --> 32:41.444
You never heard of it?

32:41.464 --> 32:44.374
Okay, well, it's about this girl.

32:44.394 --> 32:45.474
These guys kill her family.

32:46.254 --> 32:47.334
So she teams up with a soldier.

32:47.354 --> 32:48.414
- Um...
- And then they...

32:48.434 --> 32:50.244
No spoilers.

32:51.264 --> 32:53.304
- What's it called The Six?
- Yeah.

32:55.354 --> 32:56.454
Yes! Let's watch it.

32:58.444 --> 33:00.384
Oh wait, there won't be time to finish.

33:01.324 --> 33:03.012
Unless you sleep over.

33:04.264 --> 33:05.414
Mom okay with that?

33:05.434 --> 33:06.763
Do you wanna stay?

33:08.334 --> 33:10.344
- Yeah.
- Then let's call her.

33:10.464 --> 33:11.474
Okay.

33:19.264 --> 33:20.474
Hi, this is Katie. I'm not in right now,

33:21.254 --> 33:22.294
- so leave a message.
- Voicemail.

33:22.314 --> 33:23.344
Okay.

33:23.364 --> 33:25.304
Hey, it's me.

33:25.324 --> 33:27.464
So, I'm with Dad, and we're
about to watch The Six.

33:28.244 --> 33:31.294
So, can I please stay over so
that we can finish watching it?

33:32.264 --> 33:34.384
Okay, I love you. Bye.

33:34.404 --> 33:36.304
I'll drop her at school in the morning.

33:36.324 --> 33:37.404
You have some time off.

33:37.424 --> 33:39.454
Enjoy a night on your own for once.

33:54.454 --> 33:58.424
I know you wanna get to the biz.
But I got to show you this, eh?

34:00.364 --> 34:02.254
Oh, shit!

34:02.444 --> 34:06.244
Oh, shit!

34:06.264 --> 34:08.264
Ooh. Ooh-whoo!

34:08.284 --> 34:09.404
Yow!

34:09.424 --> 34:12.264
- You own a cobra, doc.
- Na, na, na, na,

34:12.284 --> 34:13.384
I keep a cobra, all right.

34:13.404 --> 34:16.364
Nobody owns a cobra.

34:16.384 --> 34:19.333
- Yo, what's his name?
- Nick.

34:19.353 --> 34:22.384
Nick, that's a great name, Nick.

34:22.404 --> 34:24.353
- Ooh.
- It's a lot of work though.

34:24.373 --> 34:27.293
Get this nigga live mice.

34:27.313 --> 34:28.393
That's an exotic ass pet, you know.

34:28.414 --> 34:31.324
It's not really sanctioned
by the city, but,

34:31.344 --> 34:32.384
you know, if you want one

34:32.404 --> 34:34.373
I got a dude who could hook you up.

34:36.454 --> 34:39.373
Oh, shit. I mean, I'm staying
on my man rasta's couch,

34:39.393 --> 34:42.474
but cobra would be fucking sick.

34:43.254 --> 34:45.393
So what's that
business prospect you have?

34:45.414 --> 34:47.324
I'm about to let you now.

34:47.344 --> 34:49.293
Go ahead and take a picture of
this beautiful motherfucker.

34:50.344 --> 34:52.333
Chemistry between the leads is good.

34:53.344 --> 34:55.454
- They were dating on set.
- Go on.

34:55.474 --> 34:59.244
They're broken up now, but there
are pictures of them on his boat.

34:59.264 --> 35:00.314
Uh-huh.

35:00.334 --> 35:03.314
I like how the girl narrates the story.

35:03.334 --> 35:05.324
We could do that in Wilderness.

35:05.344 --> 35:07.414
That's what made me think of it.

35:07.434 --> 35:09.304
See it all through her eyes.

35:13.365 --> 35:15.325
_

35:21.354 --> 35:23.294
You said you'd bring
her home after dinner.

35:25.304 --> 35:27.244
- We decided to watch a movie.
- No.

35:27.444 --> 35:29.354
You don't just decide.

35:29.374 --> 35:31.334
It was Emma's idea.

35:31.354 --> 35:33.754
- Why do I have to justify everything?
- Are you trying to revoke me?

35:34.254 --> 35:35.324
Is what this is?

35:35.344 --> 35:37.454
Last year I felt so guilty,

35:37.474 --> 35:39.314
I let you make the rules.

35:39.334 --> 35:40.444
Random fucking rules.

35:40.464 --> 35:43.264
She can't sleep at my place.
I can't pick her up...

35:43.284 --> 35:45.254
Do you want this to go to court?

35:48.274 --> 35:51.274
You're so sure you're
on the right side of this.

35:51.294 --> 35:53.314
So call the cops.

35:53.334 --> 35:55.374
Tell them that you have
no custody agreement,

35:55.394 --> 35:58.254
and that your daughter is spending
the night at her dad's place

35:58.274 --> 35:59.364
for the first time in months,

35:59.384 --> 36:01.374
and see what they say.

36:01.394 --> 36:03.474
Alternatively, come on in.

36:04.254 --> 36:06.112
Ask Emma how she feels.

36:12.254 --> 36:15.274
I really hoped that we could do
this by trusting each other.

36:17.394 --> 36:18.434
Clearly I was wrong.

36:19.394 --> 36:20.454
Clearly you were.

36:31.434 --> 36:33.354
- Yeah.
- It's done.

36:34.444 --> 36:36.334
Can you be more specific?

36:36.354 --> 36:38.374
You got a sit down tomorrow.

36:38.394 --> 36:40.304
As in a couple of hours from now?

36:40.324 --> 36:41.474
Yeah, my boy came through.

36:42.254 --> 36:44.384
Listen, you better be ready.

36:44.404 --> 36:46.274
These people are about business, so...

36:46.294 --> 36:48.354
you got to be the fucking
monopoly man in there.

36:49.374 --> 36:50.454
Well done Yago.

36:52.334 --> 36:53.374
Where do you expect?

36:54.374 --> 36:55.405
Mmm?

36:58.324 --> 37:00.354
Your date is missing out.

37:01.374 --> 37:03.394
I shouldn't have told you.

37:03.414 --> 37:05.314
Measured him more like a guy.

37:07.294 --> 37:09.304
Guys lie more than girls.

37:10.414 --> 37:13.334
Uh, I'm thinking about Rick.

37:13.354 --> 37:15.434
The way he... No,

37:15.454 --> 37:17.279
I shouldn't talk about this.

37:18.254 --> 37:19.474
I mean, it's just us girls.

37:22.294 --> 37:24.264
Rick keeps disappearing at work.

37:24.464 --> 37:26.414
You know, acting squirrelly.

37:28.474 --> 37:30.344
Squirrelly how?

37:32.264 --> 37:33.464
A woman calls,

37:34.254 --> 37:35.324
unknown number.

37:35.344 --> 37:37.314
Says it's his dentist.

37:37.334 --> 37:38.464
And bam, he's out the door.

37:39.244 --> 37:41.284
- This has happened more than once?
- Totally.

37:41.304 --> 37:42.364
He's gone for hours and then

37:42.384 --> 37:45.334
he comes back with
this story about his tooth.

37:46.464 --> 37:49.334
You think he's having an affair?

37:50.414 --> 37:53.404
Think he was acting
funny at the memorial?

37:54.424 --> 37:56.364
- The memorial?
- Mmm.

37:56.384 --> 37:57.434
I don't know.

37:58.464 --> 38:00.364
It's always the same woman?

38:00.384 --> 38:02.334
Yeah.

38:02.354 --> 38:05.384
And then we got a card in the
mail from his real dentist

38:05.404 --> 38:07.294
saying that he's overdue.

38:07.314 --> 38:11.244
- Hmm.
- So, he's not getting his teeth cleaned.

38:11.264 --> 38:14.364
He is getting his pipes cleaned.

38:29.344 --> 38:30.384
Amara.

38:31.354 --> 38:32.424
All right if we come in?

38:33.364 --> 38:34.374
It's not a great time,

38:34.394 --> 38:36.454
I've got the kid asleep upstairs.

38:36.474 --> 38:38.354
We'll be quiet.

38:40.344 --> 38:41.373
Miles.

38:43.354 --> 38:44.364
All right.

38:47.394 --> 38:50.294
It's just the kid's
a light sleeper, so...

38:55.314 --> 38:56.424
How old is she?

39:00.254 --> 39:01.304
She's 13.

39:02.254 --> 39:03.424
That's so young.

39:03.444 --> 39:05.434
Wilshire Pizza Company.

39:05.454 --> 39:07.434
Man, I head that's the shit.

39:07.454 --> 39:10.394
If anyone would like a slice,
I could heat some up.

39:10.414 --> 39:12.244
You live good, eh?

39:13.384 --> 39:14.384
Sit.

39:31.454 --> 39:32.491
You work for me?

39:34.404 --> 39:36.414
My understanding,
we have an arrangement.

39:37.444 --> 39:40.284
You work for me, yes or no?

39:40.304 --> 39:41.254
Yeah.

39:42.384 --> 39:44.394
But all you do is make a movie.

39:44.414 --> 39:46.304
No collections.

39:46.324 --> 39:48.394
Just one movie.

39:48.414 --> 39:51.177
Plan was I bring projects to you,

39:51.209 --> 39:53.274
you decide if you want to be involved.

39:53.294 --> 39:55.444
You only just made back your investment.

39:58.394 --> 40:00.274
Tell me about...

40:00.294 --> 40:01.424
- What is it?
- MGM.

40:01.444 --> 40:04.274
Tell me about MGM.

40:06.244 --> 40:07.414
You heard I had a film with them.

40:07.434 --> 40:10.254
Well, I heard, guy at the funeral.

40:10.274 --> 40:13.254
And you told her. Well, I'm glad
that everyone's in the loop.

40:13.454 --> 40:15.284
You don't tell me.

40:19.464 --> 40:21.354
What Ross here

40:21.374 --> 40:23.324
fails to realize,

40:23.344 --> 40:26.284
despite him clearly having his
finger on the pulse of Hollywood,

40:26.304 --> 40:29.404
is that I'm no longer
pursuing that project, Amara.

40:29.424 --> 40:32.264
I found something much better.

40:32.284 --> 40:35.294
I was going to tell you when we
were a little further along.

40:35.314 --> 40:36.404
Tell me now.

40:40.324 --> 40:43.354
Is it true that LA
is charging more for product?

40:43.374 --> 40:44.324
Who said that?

40:44.344 --> 40:45.444
It's not a secret, is it?

40:45.464 --> 40:47.374
For those of us who work for you.

40:47.394 --> 40:49.324
What's your point?

40:49.344 --> 40:52.454
What if we tell LA that we can
clean 30 million of their money?

40:52.474 --> 40:54.254
No fee.

40:54.274 --> 40:56.324
We use that to produce a movie.

40:56.344 --> 40:58.244
You get a cut of the profits.

40:58.264 --> 40:59.314
You risk nothing.

40:59.334 --> 41:01.314
And you make money off them.

41:03.314 --> 41:04.374
It's called Wilderness.

41:19.394 --> 41:21.244
What kind of pizza?

41:22.274 --> 41:23.364
Um...

41:24.284 --> 41:25.334
Pepperoni.

41:27.424 --> 41:29.434
I don't like it cold.

41:29.454 --> 41:31.384
I can heat it up for you.

41:36.324 --> 41:37.324
Then we talk.

42:05.324 --> 42:08.384
Whatever you have to say, say it fast.
I have to read five pages

42:08.404 --> 42:12.254
a minute for the next 45 minutes.
A very small-time.

42:12.274 --> 42:15.254
That's a page every 12 seconds.

42:15.274 --> 42:16.344
Yes, you see my dilemma.

42:16.364 --> 42:18.344
Hey, that book that we talked about,

42:18.364 --> 42:21.244
could I ask you to take
it off the table for me?

42:21.264 --> 42:22.384
That $30 million?

42:22.404 --> 42:24.464
I just might. I'll call you.

42:25.244 --> 42:27.354
We could be working
together again, April.

42:27.374 --> 42:29.244
How exciting for you.

42:30.454 --> 42:32.304
You still there?

42:32.324 --> 42:34.334
You should get back to your reading.

42:34.354 --> 42:36.434
By the time we hang up you'll have
cost me three-and-a-half pages.

42:36.454 --> 42:38.314
Good...

42:38.334 --> 42:41.254
- ...bye...
- Okay, fuck off.

42:54.294 --> 42:55.434
Yeah, he's going on and on about this

42:55.454 --> 42:57.314
book and what
a good movie it would make.

42:57.334 --> 42:59.454
He says he already has investors.

42:59.474 --> 43:01.354
I say, "who?"

43:01.374 --> 43:02.454
And Miles said, "We're gonna
do it just like the last one

43:02.474 --> 43:04.384
"which means laundering cash."

43:04.404 --> 43:06.314
And I say, "No, thank you."

43:07.404 --> 43:09.254
All right? I mean,
I don't need that again.

43:09.274 --> 43:10.394
Laundering Amara's cash?

43:10.414 --> 43:14.264
No, that's the best part. Not Amara.

43:14.284 --> 43:16.284
Some larger organization.

43:16.304 --> 43:17.354
Probably the cartel.

43:17.374 --> 43:20.274
Right? Capileri or whatever you told me.

43:20.294 --> 43:21.374
Did he mention the cartel?

43:21.394 --> 43:23.354
No, he didn't. But
that what it sounded like.

43:23.374 --> 43:25.364
I mean, look, we only made our
money back on our last film

43:25.384 --> 43:27.434
because of what happened to Max Kisbye.

43:27.454 --> 43:28.474
Uh...

43:29.254 --> 43:31.284
Jesus Christ, right? Poor Max.

43:32.274 --> 43:33.384
You think he killed himself?

43:34.474 --> 43:37.304
Okay, that's a loaded question.
I'm... Look, I'm not

43:37.324 --> 43:40.284
accusing Amara. Why would she do that?
Why would she want

43:40.304 --> 43:41.434
him dead? This star of her movie.

43:41.454 --> 43:44.324
- Mmm-hmm.
- Nobody knew it would sell the film.

43:44.344 --> 43:45.434
If she knew that

43:45.454 --> 43:49.354
- then she's a criminal mastermind.
- Rick,

43:49.374 --> 43:52.304
we're gonna need you to work
with Miles on that project.

43:53.454 --> 43:54.464
What?

43:55.244 --> 43:56.404
We're gonna need you to say yes.

43:58.274 --> 43:59.374
No.

43:59.394 --> 44:01.334
I understand your reluctance

44:01.354 --> 44:03.015
- after everything you've been through...
- No, you don't understand!

44:03.071 --> 44:04.404
I talked to my superior at the Bureau,

44:04.424 --> 44:08.414
I briefed him on all you
have endured, your bravery...

44:08.434 --> 44:09.995
- The ingenuity?
- Yes,

44:10.050 --> 44:12.434
and how lovely you are to work with.
That you've gone above and beyond.

44:12.454 --> 44:14.274
That's right. Above and beyond.

44:14.294 --> 44:15.354
That's right. And now I'm done.

44:15.374 --> 44:18.294
That's not how it works.

44:18.314 --> 44:21.294
She wants me to sell my house.

44:21.314 --> 44:22.374
We know.

44:22.394 --> 44:23.836
You know.

44:23.868 --> 44:26.364
You know. You're sitting there and
taking notes. You don't know.

44:27.384 --> 44:28.394
This is my life.

44:28.414 --> 44:30.304
Okay. Let's switch places

44:30.324 --> 44:32.304
and she can sell your fucking house.

44:32.324 --> 44:34.394
Every... Every time you tell me just...

44:34.414 --> 44:36.464
Just a little bit more and then I'm out.

44:37.244 --> 44:39.374
And now... Now, this week you're just

44:39.394 --> 44:41.334
moving the goal line again.

44:41.354 --> 44:44.314
I'm not gonna spy on the cartel.
I'm not gonna do it.

44:44.326 --> 44:45.552
It's not enough you're
gonna get me killed,

44:45.563 --> 44:46.565
you're gonna get me tortured,

44:46.576 --> 44:48.284
- then killed?
- Oh, we're not gonna let

44:48.304 --> 44:51.264
anything happen to you.
We are using all our resources

44:51.284 --> 44:52.384
- to ensure your absolute...
- Well, thank you for that.

44:52.404 --> 44:54.424
- But I am out.
- Okay, let's stay calm.

44:54.444 --> 44:57.304
I'm done, okay?
Don't call me. All right?

44:57.324 --> 44:59.244
Good luck with your case
and the next case.

44:59.264 --> 45:00.304
- You should probably lower your voice.
- You know what?

45:00.324 --> 45:01.414
I want my real jacket back.

45:01.434 --> 45:03.434
'Cause the ones that
you give me? Cheaply made.

45:03.454 --> 45:05.334
See? Right there. Look, loose threads.

45:05.354 --> 45:07.424
Take some time. Cool down.
When you're ready, you...

45:17.274 --> 45:18.364
You can sit right over here.

45:20.464 --> 45:24.274
My name is Rafael, if there's
anything that you need.

45:25.274 --> 45:27.314
All right. I'm good.

45:27.334 --> 45:28.334
An espresso?

45:30.254 --> 45:31.394
Rafael, that would be great.

45:35.374 --> 45:36.414
We'll be right with you.

45:36.434 --> 45:37.474
No worries.

45:43.264 --> 45:44.274
Hey.

45:44.294 --> 45:45.314
Good morning.

45:52.374 --> 45:55.454
We'll be good now. Why don't you start?

45:55.474 --> 45:58.314
Well, I don't know what
you've been told about why...

45:58.334 --> 46:01.344
We know what you're proposing.
We need specifics.

46:01.364 --> 46:03.434
Okay. Um...

46:03.454 --> 46:07.254
Well, I did some research and...

46:09.264 --> 46:12.284
Turns out more money moves through
the Hollywood film industry

46:12.304 --> 46:15.474
than moves through all the casinos
on the Vegas strip combined.

46:16.254 --> 46:17.384
So, for an operation like yours...

46:17.404 --> 46:19.334
We know the financial side,

46:19.354 --> 46:20.454
and what you did for Amara.

46:20.474 --> 46:22.344
- Okay.
- We're in LA.

46:22.364 --> 46:24.424
We know the entertainment business.

46:24.444 --> 46:26.434
And as far as we can tell,

46:26.454 --> 46:29.284
you would have lost Amara's investment

46:29.304 --> 46:31.354
if one of your actors
hadn't made headlines.

46:31.374 --> 46:33.404
By dying.

46:33.424 --> 46:35.324
You should that
every time you make a film.

46:35.344 --> 46:37.334
Yeah but this, uh...

46:37.354 --> 46:39.284
This will not lose money.

46:39.434 --> 46:41.354
It's from a book,

46:41.374 --> 46:44.264
uh, which has won all kinds of awards.

46:44.284 --> 46:45.344
What's the story?

46:45.364 --> 46:47.294
It's uh...

46:50.274 --> 46:53.294
I... I was told we were gonna
talk finances. So I'm not...

46:53.314 --> 46:56.374
But yeah, it's about a girl

46:56.394 --> 47:00.274
who's trying to find a better...

47:00.294 --> 47:03.294
Uh... It's... It's also about,

47:05.384 --> 47:06.404
um...

47:08.344 --> 47:10.354
I'm gonna start over.

47:12.927 --> 47:14.254
Mmm.

47:19.434 --> 47:23.294
There's been a breakdown of society.

47:23.314 --> 47:25.344
And we it all through the eyes of this

47:25.364 --> 47:26.474
13-year-old girl.

47:27.254 --> 47:28.344
She comes across a man

47:28.364 --> 47:30.304
- who's horribly wounded.
- Can I look at the script?

47:31.244 --> 47:32.264
Yeah.

47:33.284 --> 47:34.464
The girl and this stranger,

47:35.244 --> 47:36.404
they don't trust each other.

47:36.424 --> 47:37.464
But they stay together

47:38.244 --> 47:41.374
to fight off the gangs and the thieves

47:41.394 --> 47:43.354
and, you, know, the cannibals.

47:43.374 --> 47:45.434
But it's not about
all that stuff. It's...

47:47.384 --> 47:48.464
It's about more than that.

47:49.244 --> 47:50.394
- A metaphor.
- For what?

47:50.414 --> 47:52.434
- That if we work together...
- Let him answer.

47:59.454 --> 48:02.394
It's about being tough on the outside,

48:02.414 --> 48:04.464
while you try not to lose yourself.

48:06.274 --> 48:08.414
It's about what we hold on to

48:08.434 --> 48:10.474
if anything is to have meaning.

48:13.264 --> 48:16.314
It's about how hard it is
to love another person.

48:16.334 --> 48:19.284
And the life that we are
leaving for our children.

48:22.294 --> 48:23.404
It's really something.

48:35.314 --> 48:36.404
That's all the time we have.

48:36.424 --> 48:37.444
We'll let you know.

48:38.404 --> 48:39.414
Um...

48:41.424 --> 48:43.354
Should I leave the script?

48:43.374 --> 48:44.444
- Hello, again.
- Hey.

48:44.464 --> 48:46.374
Do you have parking
that needs validating?

48:49.364 --> 48:50.404
Yeah.

49:30.404 --> 49:31.404
Hey.

49:33.304 --> 49:34.334
What?

49:34.354 --> 49:36.384
Lost your voice? You want to come in?

49:37.284 --> 49:38.294
Okay.

49:39.434 --> 49:42.374
What's... What's up? What's with the...

49:42.394 --> 49:44.294
Harpo Marx routine?

49:45.264 --> 49:46.304
Freaking me out.

49:46.324 --> 49:48.404
Stan Getz. Yeah.

49:48.424 --> 49:51.284
Yeah, he's one of my... Oh, really?

49:51.304 --> 49:52.444
You're gonna put that on right now?

49:53.834 --> 49:55.244
Well...

49:57.474 --> 49:59.334
What are you doing?

49:59.354 --> 50:00.364
Hey, buddy.

50:01.274 --> 50:02.454
Ah, there it is.

50:02.474 --> 50:05.254
Sorry about that. We have to talk.

50:06.304 --> 50:07.414
Okay.

50:07.434 --> 50:09.424
All right. You wanna turn that down?

50:09.444 --> 50:11.244
Did you go to work today?

50:12.274 --> 50:14.304
Yeah. Yeah, why?

50:14.324 --> 50:15.977
Gladys said you never showed.

50:17.444 --> 50:19.424
You checking up on me? I went to work.

50:19.444 --> 50:21.344
I didn't go to the office.

50:21.364 --> 50:22.384
I worked at Amara's.

50:22.404 --> 50:23.404
Did you go out?

50:24.304 --> 50:25.464
Why?

50:26.244 --> 50:28.304
Just asking. Did you go out?

50:29.314 --> 50:30.434
Went to the dentist, yeah.

50:30.454 --> 50:33.294
Tooth in the back, it's fucked up.

50:34.414 --> 50:36.264
Who is in the SUV?

50:37.344 --> 50:38.374
What?

50:38.394 --> 50:39.394
You heard me.

50:42.324 --> 50:43.464
Are you following me now?

50:44.244 --> 50:48.284
Come on. Those guys,
they're old friends of mine.

50:48.304 --> 50:49.414
Who do they work for?

50:53.254 --> 50:55.264
Stay away from me.
Stay away! Stay away from me.

50:55.284 --> 50:57.364
Stay away from me! Shit! Help!

50:57.384 --> 50:59.354
Help! Shit! Shit!

51:19.324 --> 51:20.384
You shot me?

51:21.334 --> 51:22.414
No!
