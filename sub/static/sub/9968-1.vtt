01:08.365 --> 01:09.896
Don't you stand there! Get in!

01:09.939 --> 01:12.606
Are you crazy? You'll get us killed! Get out of here!

01:13.814 --> 01:15.859
You gotta get in the car immediately!

02:34.816 --> 02:37.722
We did it, we did it.
I planned the whole thing and it worked.

02:38.184 --> 02:42.438
You're out, you're free. Hey, come on,
aren't you happy? Aren't you gonna thank me?

02:42.751 --> 02:47.577
Yeah, thanks a lot. I got parole on Friday.

04:48.696 --> 04:50.642
Well, I could use a good fried chicken dinner.

04:50.684 --> 04:54.002
If you do just exactly like I tell you
we'll get us a fried chicken.

04:54.144 --> 04:56.017
Put your stuff down here, right there.

04:57.163 --> 04:58.203
Go on.

04:58.583 --> 04:59.583
All right.

05:01.396 --> 05:02.409
Shit.

05:04.029 --> 05:07.275
- Go!
- What? I'm going. You go on!

05:07.723 --> 05:08.916
Lokk what I'm doing.

05:18.861 --> 05:19.901
Howdie.

05:23.428 --> 05:25.975
Good looking dog you got there. Is he friendly?

05:26.017 --> 05:27.228
No, he ain't.

05:33.070 --> 05:35.063
Tchicky, tchicky, tchicky.

05:35.390 --> 05:38.823
Here, tchicky tchicky, come on.

05:40.245 --> 05:43.612
I am looking for kinfolk. The name's Tolliver.

05:43.654 --> 05:46.251
- Wait, what's the name?
- Tolliver.

05:46.514 --> 05:49.307
- Never heard of 'em.
- What's up, Ma? - Don't bother.

05:49.350 --> 05:52.087
They moved out here out of Oklahoma about a year ago.

05:54.287 --> 05:56.727
No, Pa, I think there's a weasel in the henhouse again.

06:04.407 --> 06:06.974
Whatch this. What's he running for?

06:24.945 --> 06:26.038
Shit.

06:49.732 --> 06:52.172
You can't even grab us a lousy chicken.

06:52.958 --> 06:55.678
You can't even do a simple thing like that.

06:56.373 --> 06:59.113
I'm alergic to chickens and I'm scared of chickens.

06:59.226 --> 07:01.346
Nobody's scared of a chicken.

07:01.873 --> 07:03.193
Well, I am.

07:03.473 --> 07:04.646
You're pathetic.

07:05.193 --> 07:09.366
They made a big mistake when they put in a job.
They've should send you up to a funny-farm.

07:11.093 --> 07:12.786
Quit to bitchen and eat your dinner.

07:16.562 --> 07:17.582
I spend

07:18.375 --> 07:20.402
two whole years

07:20.444 --> 07:22.595
planning what I was gonna do when I got out,

07:22.751 --> 07:24.591
and this ain't what I was intended to do.

07:25.137 --> 07:26.584
Well, you're out and you're free.

07:27.411 --> 07:29.844
Free? You call this free?

07:31.037 --> 07:32.511
Lord, I hate this mess.

07:32.957 --> 07:34.204
What is this mess anyway?

07:35.023 --> 07:36.030
Rabbit.

07:37.510 --> 07:38.537
Rabbit?

07:39.750 --> 07:40.917
Where did you get a rabbit?

07:42.050 --> 07:43.137
Off the highway.

07:46.120 --> 07:49.980
You scraped up a squashed rabbit off the road
and you fed it to me? Are you crazy?

07:50.040 --> 07:52.286
It was warm. It's fresh meet, Al.

07:52.329 --> 07:54.013
If you wanna cook, you cook!

07:54.200 --> 07:56.400
Dude, give me a great reason or something...

07:57.646 --> 07:58.933
This is just great!

07:59.686 --> 08:01.686
Here goes another night without dinner.

08:08.111 --> 08:09.285
It's funny, ain't it?

08:11.591 --> 08:13.978
Half of us won't starve to death.

08:15.058 --> 08:17.518
Another head just stuck in the gut.

08:18.558 --> 08:21.238
The lord heat us poor beggars at all.

08:37.518 --> 08:41.445
That faithful afternoon my father said to him:

08:42.164 --> 08:44.925
"Governer, if that's your decision, fine,

08:45.458 --> 08:46.671
but you'll regret it."

08:48.011 --> 08:50.045
Judge Collier, you knew my father very well.

08:50.785 --> 08:52.238
A very good man.

08:52.294 --> 08:58.640
You've missed the amusing part, which was
that my father hadn't never ... against him.

09:03.494 --> 09:04.614
Savannah.

09:05.268 --> 09:07.048
What you're doing here?

09:07.248 --> 09:08.675
I want my mommy.

09:10.755 --> 09:13.415
Go back to your room. I'll call your mom.

09:17.342 --> 09:21.855
At which point Governer Pearce changed his entire campaign,
not knowing what dad was up to.

09:23.040 --> 09:28.127
I mean, it was a brilliant piece of political maneuver,
but I don't think it was exactly what he wanted.

09:31.176 --> 09:32.702
Dad said...

09:34.982 --> 09:36.136
What is it, Joan?

09:37.809 --> 09:41.169
Oh, it's Savannah. She wants me to say good night to her.

09:41.276 --> 09:43.736
But, Joan, he's right in the middle of his story.

09:43.779 --> 09:44.830
That's odd.

09:45.330 --> 09:49.192
Monique, give her 25 cents for her piggy bank.
Tell her I'm up as quick as I can.

09:50.623 --> 09:52.969
- Please, Richard, continue your story.
- Oh, yes, please.

09:53.223 --> 10:00.464
My dad convinced him to change his campaign, and he did,
and dad ran against him and won.

10:00.804 --> 10:01.931
That's wonderful.

10:01.974 --> 10:05.044
<i>- Tomorrow I'll be getting trouble.
- Trouble?</i>

10:05.087 --> 10:08.553
<i>You havn't fot half the trouble I've got.</i>

10:08.596 --> 10:13.976
The race for the senate seat was probably
the culmination of a lifelong dream.

10:14.656 --> 10:15.896
Here's to you.

10:19.137 --> 10:20.470
<i>Damn right.</i>

10:20.590 --> 10:24.947
<i>- I'm going to teach my mother a lesson.
- Me, too.</i>

10:24.990 --> 10:28.010
<i>I'm just waiting for one more thing to happen.</i>

10:28.053 --> 10:30.283
<i>- Me, too.
- Spanky.</i>

10:30.914 --> 10:32.714
<i>What do you want now?</i>

10:32.834 --> 10:36.780
<i>I'm about to have dancing lessons and so are you.</i>

10:36.823 --> 10:40.127
<i>- Mom said so.
- Dancing lessons?</i>

10:40.636 --> 10:41.796
<i>That's terrible.</i>

10:41.839 --> 10:45.710
<i>- They won't hold me. Are you with me?
- You can count on me. We can fix that.</i>

10:55.983 --> 10:57.703
We'll talk to you later. Okay.

10:58.786 --> 11:00.666
- Good night.
- Thank you. - Bye.

11:04.206 --> 11:08.673
If I get judge Collier's support, it will be a miracle,
an absolute miracle.

11:10.834 --> 11:13.989
What are you're talking about? You have his support.

11:14.134 --> 11:15.975
He knows nobody else will win.

11:16.395 --> 11:18.041
He was your father's best friend.

11:18.084 --> 11:19.088
You...

11:19.131 --> 11:23.877
talking in the middle of my story, the confusion
could've dropping them all.

11:24.358 --> 11:27.004
We must've truly made a great impression.

11:27.068 --> 11:30.195
We don't have to impress Bill Collier.

11:30.681 --> 11:36.275
Of course we do. He's chief justice of the Supreme Court of the
State. He also happens to be head of the party. I need him.

11:36.318 --> 11:37.468
You've got him.

11:38.729 --> 11:40.975
I'm sorry the evening didn't go well for you.

11:41.555 --> 11:44.469
- I thought it was delightful.
- Joan...

11:46.407 --> 11:48.687
You don't really wan't me to run for the senate, do you?

11:49.214 --> 11:54.094
Oh, Richard, please, it's a little late in the day
to be worrying what I want, don't you think?

11:54.137 --> 11:55.480
That is not true.

11:56.423 --> 11:58.836
And I need my wife's support above all.

11:58.897 --> 12:00.003
You have it.

12:01.910 --> 12:03.963
And if it's winning you want,

12:05.610 --> 12:06.723
you win.

12:27.222 --> 12:28.349
Savannah?

12:30.969 --> 12:31.989
Sweety?

12:42.352 --> 12:45.538
I told you to get rid of the car. You call this a car?

12:45.600 --> 12:49.500
It's the only one I could find.
Besides, it was easy. Somebody left the keys in.

12:49.874 --> 12:51.854
Sure, it's one way to get rid of it.

13:01.613 --> 13:04.586
- Hey, Joan!
- Yes, I'm coming.

13:09.198 --> 13:10.258
Keep Savannah...

13:10.301 --> 13:12.511
- Goodbye, honey.
- We're late. - See you tomorrow.

13:12.581 --> 13:16.307
- We've only 30 mins, let's go.
- Goodbye, Monique, and

13:16.350 --> 13:18.894
get Spirit. Bye, bye, honey, love ya.

13:53.369 --> 13:56.575
Now don't you go chicken on me. This tank has cash.

13:57.289 --> 13:59.975
This thing with armed robberies stinks, Alvie.

14:00.438 --> 14:02.499
You just do what I tell you!

14:02.542 --> 14:04.199
Look at this place. It's a dump!

14:04.242 --> 14:08.408
- We aren't gonna make a score here!
- You leave that to me! I've decided that.

14:16.525 --> 14:18.678
- Come on!
- I don't feel good about this.

14:18.721 --> 14:19.731
Look...

14:19.774 --> 14:23.065
All you gotta do is to wait there and
to stand by that door. Okay?

14:23.187 --> 14:26.401
I'll go inside, grab the cash, and we're out of here. Okay?

14:26.577 --> 14:29.697
- It ain't gonna work, Alvie!
- Of course it's gonna work! Now, come on!

14:36.442 --> 14:38.727
- Will you get out of the car?
- Do we have to do this?

14:38.770 --> 14:41.250
- Get out of the car, now!
- All right, all right, I'm coming.

14:49.431 --> 14:50.978
Have a nice day. Come on.

15:10.363 --> 15:16.263
- Good morning. Ah, the polens got to you too, I see.
- Shut up! This is a stick-up!

15:17.168 --> 15:19.354
- Are you kidding?
- No, I ain't kidding!

15:19.397 --> 15:22.340
Open that register, put the money in the sack,
and make it fast!

15:22.383 --> 15:25.624
All right. But you'll be not very happy with the amount.

15:25.667 --> 15:29.063
- Well, give me what's in the register. What you got there?
- Hm, let's see.

15:30.888 --> 15:32.354
We got, uh...

15:33.008 --> 15:37.088
18 dollars and, um...

15:37.547 --> 15:38.867
33 cents.

15:38.910 --> 15:41.314
- Hardly worth the trouble.
- Give me that. Hey, Boots!

15:41.357 --> 15:42.934
Get in here! Get in here fast!

15:42.977 --> 15:47.777
- Put all you can get in this, and make it fast!
- You won't get away with this!

15:47.819 --> 15:53.455
- All this effort for lousy 19 dollars and 43 cents?
- 33 dollars and 43 cents!

15:53.498 --> 15:55.527
- Alvie, leave him alone!
- Do what I told you!

15:55.569 --> 15:57.489
- Come on. Let's get out of here!

15:57.532 --> 16:00.938
You're going to jail because I'm calling the police
as soon you get out of here!

16:00.981 --> 16:05.138
They will catch you! You hear me?

16:05.181 --> 16:07.308
Please, Alvie, come on! Let's get out of here!

16:07.351 --> 16:12.234
You put that back or you're gonna be sorry!
You heard what I said?

16:12.277 --> 16:14.464
Come on, let's get out of here!

16:14.507 --> 16:20.413
- Grab the bag! Come on!
- Come back here! You come back here!

16:27.966 --> 16:31.052
Help! I'm being robbed! Help!

16:31.095 --> 16:34.588
- The car won't start.
- What you're gonna do?

16:34.631 --> 16:41.044
It's one hell of get-away car. I'll take care of it.
Here, Ill fix it. Here, grab that. And shut him up!

16:41.359 --> 16:47.699
Help! You don't even have a real gun. That's a toy pistol.
My grand kids got one just like that.

16:47.742 --> 16:53.028
- Oh, yeah? Yeah?
- Help! Help! Somebody help! Help!

16:56.033 --> 17:00.493
Help! Help! Please, help, help!

17:00.547 --> 17:03.447
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Somebody help!

17:05.900 --> 17:09.272
Help! Help!

17:10.663 --> 17:12.022
- I'm being murdered!
- Idiot!

17:13.050 --> 17:15.777
- Help!
- Idiot!

18:19.003 --> 18:22.516
Lord Almighty, Alvie! That was a close call,
all for 18 dollars and forty...

18:22.559 --> 18:23.570
Shut up!

20:55.178 --> 20:58.524
- Oh, there you are. Okay, let's go.
- You'll be real good, okay?

20:58.567 --> 21:02.773
Bye, bye. I will.

21:02.834 --> 21:05.414
Bye, bye. Have fun.

21:09.102 --> 21:10.316
Bye!

21:25.184 --> 21:28.991
That witch did a spell over the princess
and she was lost in the forest.

21:29.034 --> 21:30.491
Was she afraid?

21:30.658 --> 21:35.898
Yes, she cried herself to sleep, but soon she
was awaken by the tinkerbells,

21:35.941 --> 21:41.166
and she opened her eyes and saw her guarding angel
who said: "Don't be afraid, my child,

21:41.209 --> 21:44.735
princess ... was disguised as..."

21:44.778 --> 21:49.375
- What are beggar bumps?
- Beggars bumps, like, on scuffy type guys.

21:49.418 --> 21:51.665
Oh, yeah. Go on.

21:51.878 --> 21:57.351
Well, there'll find her and care for her,
and one day, in a magic moment, they'll change.

21:57.394 --> 21:58.807
This is my favorite part.

21:58.850 --> 22:04.343
Their love to her will her change back into a princess,
and they'll reclaim the kingdom.

22:04.386 --> 22:06.290
But what happened to the princess?

22:06.333 --> 22:10.993
- Then she'll become clean of all the round.
- Wow!

22:12.639 --> 22:15.819
- Hide and seek.
- I'll seek. Everyone hide!

22:16.738 --> 22:20.125
One, two, three, four...

22:30.079 --> 22:33.832
19, 20, 21, 22...

23:32.086 --> 23:34.486
Ready or not, here I come!

24:13.154 --> 24:14.507
How much you reckon we got?

24:14.550 --> 24:17.207
I don't know. I didn't ask her. Let's just get out of here.

24:21.209 --> 24:22.796
I'll be damned, it started.

24:31.623 --> 24:34.303
- Anybody something to drink?
- No, no, thank you.

24:43.372 --> 24:45.005
- I'll be right back.
- Sure.

24:54.655 --> 24:58.415
Hello? Yeah. Hi, Carol.

24:59.635 --> 25:02.481
What? Hold it, I can't hear nothing you say.

25:02.595 --> 25:06.475
- Try it again.
- I said I'm in the park. I can't find Savannah.

25:07.022 --> 25:08.302
<i>I've looked everywhere.</i>

25:10.982 --> 25:11.995
Joan?

25:12.368 --> 25:16.155
- I'm really scared.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute. Was she with the children?

25:16.198 --> 25:18.838
- Did you see her run off?
- Yeah, they were playing hide and seek.

25:18.881 --> 25:22.114
- Did you try the playground?
- Yeah, I tried everywhere.

25:24.080 --> 25:26.117
Carol, the street, anything.

25:26.160 --> 25:28.800
But, come on, this is impossible,
she's gotta be there somewhere.

25:28.843 --> 25:30.773
- What is it?
- Hold on.

25:30.823 --> 25:33.090
They're at the park. They can't find Savannah anywhere.

25:34.090 --> 25:37.029
Look, could you just stay right where you are?
I'll be right there.

25:37.209 --> 25:38.263
Fine.

25:38.422 --> 25:41.602
- She can't keep an eye on her for two minutes.
- Everything will be fine. Okay?

25:41.645 --> 25:43.202
Come with me, please.

25:44.678 --> 25:45.905
I think I want chocolate.

25:47.612 --> 25:49.265
Have a nice day.

25:51.393 --> 25:52.840
Wait, wait!

25:59.431 --> 26:00.438
Here.

26:00.658 --> 26:02.058
I don't like ice cream.

26:02.365 --> 26:05.152
- Everyone likes ice cream, Alvie.
- Well, I don't.

26:05.372 --> 26:07.992
- Then don't eat it.
- I ain't.

26:42.026 --> 26:43.306
Hi, what's your story?

26:44.066 --> 26:45.612
I'm sorry, officer.

26:45.888 --> 26:48.942
I was starting to pull out and I lost control of my cone.

26:49.088 --> 26:51.002
You lost control of your come?

26:51.108 --> 26:53.348
Yes, sir, I saw it with my own eyes, sir.

26:53.391 --> 26:57.644
You realize that attack an officer
with an object is against the law?

26:57.797 --> 26:58.898
Yes, sir.

27:02.295 --> 27:03.362
Hi, honey.

27:04.155 --> 27:05.662
Let me see your driver's licence.

27:07.195 --> 27:10.235
- What did you say, officer?
- I said, let me see your driver's licence.

27:10.278 --> 27:13.195
- No, no. Before that.
- I said hi to your kid.

27:13.942 --> 27:15.615
- Kid?
- Yeah.

27:24.230 --> 27:25.484
That is your kid, isn't it?

27:26.744 --> 27:34.077
Oh, you mean my sister's kid. Yeah, we just took her out
to have a big mac and an ice cream cone, officer.

27:35.322 --> 27:36.342
Aha.

27:36.385 --> 27:40.082
<i>Motor 7. Motor 7. Come in, Motor 7.</i>

27:40.785 --> 27:43.718
<i>Robbery with injuries at...</i>

27:45.657 --> 27:48.664
This is Motor 7. I'm on my way. Over.

27:58.033 --> 28:03.460
Look, I've got an emergency call, so I don't have time to book
you two, but I'll remember you, so keep your noses clean. Okay?

28:08.544 --> 28:09.557
Alvie...

28:10.391 --> 28:12.911
we've got us a hot kid in tthe back seat there.

28:13.464 --> 28:16.177
Yeah, we sure as hell do.

28:26.217 --> 28:27.224
Hi.

28:30.477 --> 28:32.171
Give her the ice cream.

28:32.851 --> 28:34.344
You want some ice cream?

28:37.692 --> 28:39.878
Thanks for not turning me in to the cops.

28:41.578 --> 28:43.818
Why, honey? What did you do?

28:46.273 --> 28:48.173
Maybe she's robbed a bank or something.

28:49.146 --> 28:51.499
I don't want them to kick me back.

28:52.239 --> 28:53.739
Back where, honey?

28:56.590 --> 28:59.196
- What's your name, kid?
- Can't tell ya.

29:00.616 --> 29:02.276
Sure you can. Uh...

29:02.403 --> 29:05.990
We're your pals, aren't we?
We didn't turn you in to the cops now, did we?

29:06.033 --> 29:08.956
- So you can tell us your name, can't ya?
- No.

29:09.336 --> 29:12.929
- Maybe I'm ought to smack her a little bit.
- What you wanna her to do? Start screaming?

29:13.103 --> 29:14.336
Um...

29:14.996 --> 29:18.783
Honey, I gave you my ice cream, didn't I, huh?

29:19.056 --> 29:22.643
- So you're gonna tell us who you are, aren't you?
- Nope.

29:28.977 --> 29:32.084
- I think we've got a problem.
- Yeah.

29:32.989 --> 29:36.682
One that could get us about 99 years in a federal den.

29:58.432 --> 30:02.031
- Did you find her?
- We haven't found her yet, but that doesn't mean anything.

30:02.074 --> 30:03.880
I appreciate your help.

30:04.107 --> 30:07.787
- Carol, how did that happen?
- We were just playing hide and seek.

30:07.830 --> 30:11.350
- You shouldn't have let her out of your sight.
- Honey, she's just as worried as we are.

30:11.393 --> 30:15.426
- Here's the park, Alvie.
- We just drop her out here.

30:22.153 --> 30:24.606
Lord, this place is crowded with cops, man.

30:24.649 --> 30:28.769
- We can't stay here. Come on, Let's get out of here.
- All right, all right, I'm already going.

30:29.262 --> 30:34.162
Uh, just sit down, honey, just sit real low. Okay?
We're just playing a game.

30:53.517 --> 30:54.610
Okay.

30:55.823 --> 30:57.677
See that park over there?

30:57.757 --> 31:02.142
Go over to the nice police man, tell him your name,
and he'll help you find your mummy and daddy. Okay?

31:02.185 --> 31:03.397
I don't want to.

31:03.552 --> 31:06.452
- She don't wanna.
- Come on, get in the car!

31:06.992 --> 31:08.965
Do what I say! You'll be just fine.

31:30.568 --> 31:31.728
Look out!

31:32.895 --> 31:36.101
- What you're doing, trying to kill us?
- Look them damn cops over there.

31:36.201 --> 31:39.562
- What are we gonna do now?
- Go get that kid and get her out of sight. Quick!

31:39.994 --> 31:43.048
- Come on, hurry up!
- Okay, all right.

31:44.001 --> 31:45.934
Hi, honey. Let me help you.

31:46.241 --> 31:49.734
- There's no dairy steer friend here.
- What's going on here?

31:49.954 --> 31:54.508
- Is everyone all right? Do you want me to call for help?
- Oh, no, no, everything's just fine.

31:54.551 --> 31:57.361
Well, what happened? Are you okay, honey?

31:57.931 --> 32:01.297
She's just fine. She just fell out of the car.
She does that all the time.

32:01.340 --> 32:04.863
- Do you want me to call a doctor?
- No, no, she's used to it.

32:04.906 --> 32:07.647
Just give us a push, will ya? And hurry it up.

32:07.690 --> 32:10.153
- We're in a little bit of hurry.
- Thank you.

32:10.757 --> 32:13.750
Ready? One, two, three...

32:14.943 --> 32:17.390
- Okay.
- Now we've to push it from the back.

32:17.497 --> 32:20.330
We're kind of in a hurry here.
Wer'e trying to get to the airport.

32:20.397 --> 32:23.837
- Yeah.
- One, two, three...

32:26.457 --> 32:27.790
There you go.

32:31.503 --> 32:33.063
Everything's fine, officer.

32:33.106 --> 32:34.797
- No problem, officer.
- Thank you.

32:39.226 --> 32:41.506
We gotta get this kid off the street, boy.

33:04.837 --> 33:06.837
Gentlemen, please, come in.

33:17.187 --> 33:18.394
What's the situation?

33:18.437 --> 33:20.470
Patrol man Jamison here

33:20.530 --> 33:23.236
has a theory and some new evidence in the case.

33:23.279 --> 33:27.850
He believes he actually saw your child
some time around noon today.

33:28.319 --> 33:32.519
- You can't be serious. Why didn't you do something?
- That was before the APB came over my radio, sir.

33:32.926 --> 33:35.039
I was patroling the area, and

33:35.246 --> 33:38.046
something flew out of this old car and I was

33:38.712 --> 33:40.519
struck by an ice cream cone.

33:40.719 --> 33:42.499
- An ice cream cone?
- Yes, sir.

33:43.799 --> 33:46.125
There were two men in the front of this old car and

33:46.186 --> 33:50.392
a little girl, same age and description
as your daughter was, in the back seat.

33:50.666 --> 33:51.812
Why didn't you arrest them?

33:51.926 --> 33:54.181
At least give them a citation. Weren't you suspicious?

33:54.224 --> 33:55.864
What kind of a police department we have?

33:55.907 --> 34:00.473
He was following correct police procedure at that time,
Mr. Driscoll. He had nothing on that men.

34:00.516 --> 34:03.156
An officer is struck by an ice cream cone.

34:03.863 --> 34:08.849
Two unidentified men and an unidentified little girl
in the back seat, and you let them get away.

34:08.891 --> 34:11.985
You didn't even give them a ticket, so you don't have
a name, address, licence number of the car...

34:12.027 --> 34:13.928
- The car, sir, that I got.
- What?

34:13.971 --> 34:15.034
The licence number.

34:15.928 --> 34:17.355
But there is something else.

34:18.001 --> 34:21.301
I don't think either one of those guys
even knew that little girl was in their car.

34:21.344 --> 34:23.487
Well, I happen to believe it was a kidnapping.

34:23.918 --> 34:27.078
And I'll give what it costs me, who's toes I've to step on.

34:27.318 --> 34:30.851
I've already spoken to the governer.
I'm bringing in the top expert in the country.

34:31.478 --> 34:32.598
Dobbs.

34:33.971 --> 34:36.264
- Harland Dobbs?
- Yes, sir, that's right.

34:36.851 --> 34:38.824
I'm sending a plane to pick him up in Dallas.

34:58.559 --> 35:02.619
<i>...</i>

35:02.812 --> 35:05.732
and the princess ... in the forest.

35:06.089 --> 35:07.802
Are you listening?

35:07.943 --> 35:09.797
Yes. Yes.

35:09.890 --> 35:16.676
Uh, the men with the bags on their heads are in the
forest with the lady, and they're having a wonderful...

35:17.101 --> 35:18.248
Who is it?

35:18.291 --> 35:19.771
You stay right there, and don't move.

35:21.271 --> 35:24.418
- Who is it?
- <i>It's me, you idiot. Open this door!</i>

35:30.658 --> 35:33.350
- This pension had better be abandoned.
- It is.

35:33.393 --> 35:37.358
It took me an hour to turn on the light,
and the water is really dark.

35:38.291 --> 35:40.612
- You got it.
- Of course I got it.

35:40.665 --> 35:42.572
I ripped off a radio, too.

35:42.615 --> 35:45.632
We may now find out who's this kid belongs to.

35:45.841 --> 35:48.801
Bootsie, where are you?

35:49.808 --> 35:51.061
Bootsie?

35:52.465 --> 35:53.845
I'll be right there!

35:54.055 --> 35:56.055
What did you tell her your name for?

35:56.115 --> 35:58.088
We ain't do nothing wrong.

35:58.940 --> 36:03.280
We got you television!
If you're real good, tomorrow you can watch Wonder Woman!

36:03.446 --> 36:05.047
What do you want for breakfast?

36:05.560 --> 36:10.400
Chocolate milk, coco pops, butter milk,
chocolate strawberries,

36:10.443 --> 36:14.529
<i>peaches, chocolate bananas...</i>

36:14.572 --> 36:16.526
Tomorrow we'll get rid of this kid.

36:16.569 --> 36:19.163
Now let's go in there and see,
if we can get this kid to sleep.

36:19.206 --> 36:21.478
<i>...apple and bacon.</i>

36:23.205 --> 36:25.499
Okay. Now we go to sleep.

36:25.542 --> 36:27.782
If you need me, I'll be sleeping right over there. Okay?

36:27.824 --> 36:29.751
Would you tell me a bedtime story?

36:30.961 --> 36:32.988
I don't know any bedtime stories.

36:33.031 --> 36:34.588
Then I'll tell you one.

36:36.407 --> 36:37.501
Sit down.

36:43.172 --> 36:47.372
This is the story about a rabbit, a fox and a little bear.

36:48.942 --> 36:50.962
One day,

36:51.005 --> 36:53.802
they made a log and they ... on it.

36:53.845 --> 36:56.191
And then a rabbit came down the lane,

36:56.234 --> 36:59.772
just came walking down the lane,
... so hard,

36:59.815 --> 37:01.321
and he said "Howdie."

37:01.521 --> 37:04.748
He already knew them but he couldn't talk.

37:05.455 --> 37:11.741
And then they said: "If you don't say howdie,
I'll knock your head clean off!"

37:12.100 --> 37:19.659
And he knocked his head off, and he kicked his head
into the bucket, and it was all stuck up in the tarr.

37:19.744 --> 37:22.517
And then the fox and little bear

37:22.560 --> 37:27.712
...

37:27.785 --> 37:29.966
"We got you now, rabbit.

37:30.013 --> 37:34.146
And I'm gonna cock ya, skin ya, and put ya in the pot.

37:34.312 --> 37:38.258
And then the fox told ... to get ready,

37:38.301 --> 37:42.054
and then the rabbit said:
"You can do anything you want ...

37:42.097 --> 37:45.634
"but please don't ...

37:45.717 --> 37:47.490
Please, please."

37:47.570 --> 37:49.870
And then the fox ...

37:50.184 --> 37:52.410
"Hmm. That's exactly what we gonna do."

37:52.453 --> 37:57.864
...

37:57.919 --> 38:01.165
And then the rabbit ...,

38:01.219 --> 38:04.819
then he was laughing as hard as he can and said:

38:04.862 --> 38:09.452
"I ..."

- Yeah?

38:20.910 --> 38:24.903
Tomorrow I'll better call mummy
and tell her I had a sleepover.

38:28.650 --> 38:33.150
Well, you tell us where to call,
and we call her right now.

38:33.462 --> 38:35.929
Oh, no, tomorrow will be fine.

38:36.102 --> 38:37.229
Good night.

38:39.836 --> 38:40.869
Good night.

38:57.331 --> 38:59.531
- We've done it, Boots!
- Sshh, sshh.

38:59.574 --> 39:03.977
- We've done it. We stepped right in a gold mine!
- Sshh, shut up! You don't wanna wake up the kid.

39:04.020 --> 39:06.114
- Read this, read this.
- What is it?

39:06.157 --> 39:07.800
Look at the picture, stupid!

39:08.263 --> 39:13.329
- Hey, it's our kid!
- Not our kid! It's this guy Driscoll's kid!

39:13.372 --> 39:18.138
He's a millionaire. His daddy died last year
and left him about 20 million bucks.

39:18.181 --> 39:19.407
It says her name's Savannah.

39:19.450 --> 39:23.048
Can't you see that isn't about the name?
Read the whole think. Look at that.

39:24.477 --> 39:29.763
They got a hundred thousand dollar reward
for her save return.

39:32.227 --> 39:37.273
- 100,000.
- We're rich, Alvie. We're rich!

39:37.329 --> 39:41.475
All we've to do is to keep that kid happy
until we can grab the reward.

39:41.518 --> 39:43.038
We go to get that money.

39:43.081 --> 39:46.725
- Now I can go and live in style.
- Yeah, and we can get a new car.

39:46.848 --> 39:52.421
I could buy a little whisky bar, with cold beer,

39:52.464 --> 39:57.077
and live like a king for the rest
of my whole god damned life!

39:57.537 --> 39:59.310
It ain't gonna work, Alvie.

39:59.617 --> 40:00.630
What?

40:01.184 --> 40:03.617
- What ain't gonna work?
- You're a fugitive.

40:03.676 --> 40:05.730
They don't gonna believe we found that kid.

40:05.773 --> 40:07.036
We've got records.

40:07.229 --> 40:10.023
It's a lifetime crime. They call it kidnapping.

40:10.849 --> 40:12.263
You listen to me!

40:12.682 --> 40:17.589

If you get fired, I'll just have to marry you
and take you out of all this.

42:59.461 --> 43:02.881
Wow, you don't waste much time, do you, boy?

43:02.924 --> 43:06.661
Yeah. Why waiting for much time? What's the point?

43:09.941 --> 43:12.708
- How did you like my singing anyway?
- Oh, it's beautiful.

43:12.751 --> 43:16.437
You know, with a voice like yours,
you ought to be recording stuff.

43:18.004 --> 43:19.258
Thanks.

43:19.377 --> 43:27.147
You know, if I could afford it, ...
a ranger, and take a little job in a launge.

43:27.190 --> 43:29.321
Make a sense of something, you know.

43:29.364 --> 43:31.610
How much money do you need?

43:31.770 --> 43:35.570
More than I could get in a job like this, that's for sure.

43:36.683 --> 43:40.310
Well, I know that. I wanna help you, Doreen, I do.

43:42.802 --> 43:44.442
You're so sweet.

43:44.869 --> 43:49.802
I've never felt such a powerful need
for anybody in my whole life.

43:52.719 --> 43:53.799
Wow.

43:54.299 --> 44:01.425
Alvie, if you're rich, if you could help me,
take care of me, of my kids, you know,

44:01.468 --> 44:05.007
...

44:05.050 --> 44:09.929
Well, never judge a book by it's cook.

44:10.799 --> 44:12.446
What do you mean?

44:12.512 --> 44:18.405
Well, I've got a little proposal
that I know you just gonna love.

44:19.469 --> 44:23.796
...

45:11.310 --> 45:13.264
I can't believe Doreen won't do it.

45:13.384 --> 45:15.317
I can't believe it, either.

45:15.424 --> 45:18.057
Not even for half of the reward money!

45:18.273 --> 45:22.892
And I thought I had her soul, too.
Oh, god, I must've drunk 200 beers.

45:22.959 --> 45:25.479
- So what we're gonna do now?
- Look...

45:25.866 --> 45:28.819
we've found that kid fair and square.

45:28.877 --> 45:33.263
- And I'm gonna get that reward money.
- The longer we keep her, the worst it's gonna get.

45:33.306 --> 45:36.337
- You know what she had me to do?
- <i>Bootsie!</i>

45:36.533 --> 45:41.519
- Yes, wicked step mother?
- Come get the garbage! ...

45:41.619 --> 45:44.505
- <i>...</i>
- Yes, wicked step mother!

45:44.548 --> 45:48.253
- I'm telling you, she's driving me crazy.
- One thing's sure.

45:48.296 --> 45:51.675
We gotta take the heat off. We gotta call her folks.

45:53.588 --> 45:54.595
Yeah.

45:55.815 --> 46:01.015
Yeah, she could say "Hello, mummy, I'm okay",

46:01.068 --> 46:03.362
tell her what happened, and that we wanna give her back.

46:03.405 --> 46:08.175
And to figure out some easy way
to get us the hundred grand.

46:08.871 --> 46:10.078
Sounds simple.

46:14.130 --> 46:17.430
Is Savannah highly imaginative, Joan?

46:19.243 --> 46:21.870
Yes, I suppose she is.

46:22.050 --> 46:23.450
Is she alone a lot?

46:23.810 --> 46:26.816
As you know, I'm running for the senate,
so there's a big demand of my time.

46:26.910 --> 46:27.930
Yes.

46:28.736 --> 46:33.083
Well, would you say she lives in a make-believe world?

46:34.399 --> 46:39.486
- She's brighter than an usual 6 year old.
- You didn't answer my question.

46:39.552 --> 46:41.572
- What this has to do with...
- Did she run away?

46:41.615 --> 46:46.761
- Is it possible Savannah left home on her own regard?
- That is absolutely absurd. Why would you even think...

46:52.636 --> 46:55.396
- Hello?
- <i>Yeah, hello. Are you Mr. Driscoll?</i>

46:55.469 --> 46:57.969
Yes, this is Mr. Driscoll. It's them.

46:58.342 --> 47:02.435
<i>Listen, we got Savannah and she's just fine.</i>

47:02.478 --> 47:05.475
We found her in the back seat of a car.

47:05.518 --> 47:09.671
She wouldn't tell us her name, she's kind of cute that way.

47:10.051 --> 47:13.291
But she's okay, and she wants to say hi to her mummy.

47:14.585 --> 47:18.471
Sounds like it could be a prank.
Just try not to be emotional.

47:19.358 --> 47:20.605
<i>Hello, mommy.</i>

47:22.103 --> 47:23.597
Hello, darling.

47:24.225 --> 47:26.838
- Hello, how are you?
- I'm fine.

47:26.881 --> 47:28.518
It's her. It is Savannah.

47:28.561 --> 47:29.638
<i>Precious...</i>

47:29.948 --> 47:32.234
<i>Precious, are they taking good care of you?</i>

47:32.314 --> 47:34.608
Oh, yes, we're having lots of fun.

47:35.994 --> 47:37.908
Good, that's good.

47:38.088 --> 47:42.448
- Listen, are you warm, are you eating well?
- Oh, sure.

47:42.954 --> 47:43.954
Yes.

47:44.874 --> 47:48.181
Darling, I love you very much. Can you say hello to daddy?

47:49.473 --> 47:51.659
- Hi, baby, how are you?
- I'm fine.

47:51.719 --> 47:54.019
Get on with it. A hundred grand, remember?

47:54.093 --> 47:56.966
Hello, yours truly gettin' on.

47:57.225 --> 48:01.492
Listen, we gotta figure out a plan
here on how to get the kid back,

48:01.535 --> 48:05.047
but we don't want no problems,
understand, and no cops.

48:05.090 --> 48:07.517
- She will be...
- <i>Three minutes. If you want to...</i>

48:07.560 --> 48:09.501
Alvie, do you have a dime?

48:09.544 --> 48:12.357
- Why did you got no change?
- Where did I suppose to get change?

48:12.400 --> 48:14.260
I can't rely on you for nothing!

48:14.793 --> 48:17.360
Uh, hello...

48:17.493 --> 48:21.433
Listen, we've got a problem here, we ran out of dime, see.

48:21.498 --> 48:25.798
- <i>So we'll call you back tomorrow.</i>
- If you harm my daughter in any way...

48:29.776 --> 48:32.409
Looks like we've got us a couple of real jokers here.

48:35.896 --> 48:40.055
You believe them about finding Savannah in their car?

48:40.349 --> 48:41.556
It's quite possible.

48:41.922 --> 48:43.555
She was playing hide and seek, remember?

48:43.782 --> 48:45.316
She could've hidden in the car.

48:45.562 --> 48:48.322
Well, that makes no difference.
They got her and they want the money.

48:48.675 --> 48:51.289
But there's something I can't put my finger on here.

48:51.502 --> 48:53.502
- What's that?
- That voice.

48:53.982 --> 48:56.602
I've heard that voice somewhere before.

49:02.622 --> 49:05.335
Yeah, just park it right down there.

49:05.515 --> 49:09.149
- You didn't say nothing. You've got clumsy.
- I think, we're doing just fine.

49:09.195 --> 49:11.281
If you're gonna blow this, I'll sure shoot you.

49:17.638 --> 49:18.877
Where you're going?

49:18.920 --> 49:21.156
I'm gonna get some stuff for Savannah in the drugstore.

49:21.199 --> 49:24.496
- Look, we're sitting duckside here.
- You're wanna keep her happy, don't you?

49:24.539 --> 49:25.685
I'll be right back.

50:03.168 --> 50:05.721
So, are you a new father?

50:05.788 --> 50:09.714
Uh, me, no. This stuff is for my sister's kid.

50:09.757 --> 50:12.428
Ah. Boy or girl?

50:13.103 --> 50:14.103
Boy.

50:15.257 --> 50:16.817
How old is the little fella?

50:16.903 --> 50:19.317
Uh, six, seven...

50:19.450 --> 50:22.350
I don't know really, see...

50:23.790 --> 50:25.397
- I'm a merchant marine.
- Ah.

50:25.440 --> 50:29.250
Yeah, just got in from San Francisco.
We just pulled in here on a tanker.

50:29.740 --> 50:31.946
We were out to sea for six years.

50:32.220 --> 50:33.700
Do you like me, Alvie?

50:35.526 --> 50:36.806
Why not?

50:37.420 --> 50:39.580
You've never done nothing to me.

50:40.746 --> 50:42.426
Well, do you like me?

50:42.560 --> 50:44.280
Sure I like you, kid.

50:44.753 --> 50:46.420
You're gonna make me rich.

50:46.606 --> 50:49.606
They gonna pay me a whole lot of money,
just to get rid of you.

50:49.813 --> 50:53.759
- Is that the only reason you like me?
- Yep, that's about it.

51:03.491 --> 51:05.658
Sis had the kid while I was in Singapore.

51:06.111 --> 51:10.218
She's had it really rough, husband's a bum, heavy drinker,

51:10.724 --> 51:12.451
you know, he beats the kid...

51:12.494 --> 51:15.000
We were abandoned by our mother when we were 4 years old.

51:15.043 --> 51:16.141
- No!
- Yeah.

51:24.834 --> 51:26.148
Going to bed, Joan?

51:30.114 --> 51:32.041
Aw, I can't sleep.

51:33.554 --> 51:34.948
Why don't you take something?

51:36.114 --> 51:38.754
I did. Dr. Morton gave me something.

51:40.167 --> 51:42.147
You're gonna get sick if you don't get some rest.

51:46.608 --> 51:48.374
That child is all I have.

51:50.668 --> 51:52.688
I've got no one in the whole world.

51:56.228 --> 51:57.761
She sounded fine.

51:58.421 --> 52:02.201
I'm sure that now Dobbs is on the case,
we'll get her back in no time.

52:02.434 --> 52:04.721
Richard, there're no garanties.

52:09.728 --> 52:12.688
I just can't stop wondering

52:14.021 --> 52:15.728
what could be happening to her,

52:18.108 --> 52:21.008
what terrible thing could be happening to her

52:22.128 --> 52:24.001
at this very moment.

52:24.208 --> 52:28.067
♪ There's one little duck swimming in the sea ♪

52:28.141 --> 52:30.818
♪ He was very lonely but didn't want to be ♪

52:30.861 --> 52:34.621
♪ So he ran far away over the sea ♪

52:34.714 --> 52:38.308
♪ And brought back a friend to live with him ♪

52:38.574 --> 52:42.654
- <i>♪ There was one little duck swimming in the sea ♪</i>
- You want some hot water?

52:42.697 --> 52:43.950
<i>No, thanks.</i>

52:44.297 --> 52:48.723
- You better get clean.
- I'm so clean... I'm puckered.

52:48.910 --> 52:51.703
<i>♪ There was one little duck swimming in the sea ♪</i>

52:51.746 --> 52:55.030
- She's having fun.
- Sounds like it.

52:57.757 --> 53:01.030
Tomorrow I'm gonna  rip off some towels
and some sheets and stuff.

53:01.957 --> 53:04.497
Tomorrow we gonna send the kid's folks a letter.

53:04.540 --> 53:06.897
- I got it all read out here.
- What for?

53:06.940 --> 53:12.386
Because they trace fone calls, stupid, they got
helicopters, they can zapp right down on you.

53:12.429 --> 53:13.906
I haven't thought of that.

53:14.407 --> 53:18.307
Bootsie, can I have a rubber duckie for my bath?

53:18.350 --> 53:20.990
She wants her duckie. I got her one.

53:21.033 --> 53:23.333
Yeah, I will be right there with it! Just a minute!

53:23.376 --> 53:26.546
A duckie? You actually got this kid a duckie?

53:26.653 --> 53:28.515
You said we got to keep her happy, didn't you?

53:28.558 --> 53:31.335
Besides, didn't you never want something like that
when you was a kid?

53:31.378 --> 53:32.402
Hell, no!

53:33.391 --> 53:35.831
That's the problem with you, Alvie, you never was a kid.

53:41.677 --> 53:44.143
- I notified the FBI.
- Great.

53:44.810 --> 53:49.976
Now, I wanna run down on all robberies and burgleries
in this state, Texas, Colorado and New Mexico.

53:50.036 --> 53:52.222
And I need a list of all stolen vehicles.

53:52.303 --> 53:53.396
We have all that.

53:53.439 --> 53:56.815
Get in touch with the booking offices
of all prisons in those states.

53:56.858 --> 54:00.384
I want a list of all these, and the names
of any recently released prisoners,

54:00.427 --> 54:03.867
- where they are, and mug shots.
- We're putting all this together at this very moment.

54:03.909 --> 54:07.639
I want officer Jamison to go over the mug shots
until we get an identification.

54:07.682 --> 54:08.862
He's doing that right now.

54:08.905 --> 54:13.998
Now, any stranger in anybody's neighbourhood,
anyone that looks at least suspicious,

54:14.041 --> 54:16.318
I want a report on him, look at him and asking.

54:16.361 --> 54:17.408
We're doing all that.

54:17.475 --> 54:21.315
All the phones in the Driscoll's house have to be
connected, so we can back up any incoming call.

54:21.357 --> 54:22.441
It's been done.

54:24.751 --> 54:28.937
- I've a feeling you boys don't need me.
- You said it.

54:38.326 --> 54:44.419
- Mrs. Driscoll, how do you...
- No more questions, please. The Driscolls

54:45.039 --> 54:47.566
have been in a state of a shock since this

54:47.973 --> 54:50.239
dreadful thing has happened, and...

54:50.572 --> 54:54.318
Well, I feel like a member of the family,
and I would like to say to those

54:54.361 --> 54:56.132
<i>who took this precious little child,</i>

54:56.308 --> 55:00.988
<i>to remember the words of Jesus:
"Suffering little children are coming to me,</i>

55:01.441 --> 55:03.781
<i>for such is the kingdom of heaven."</i>

55:05.055 --> 55:09.587
- You don't spit on a priest!
- I didn't spit on a priest. I spit on a TV.

55:09.875 --> 55:13.494
- Well, clean it off the TV.
- Clean it off yourself.

55:13.567 --> 55:15.868
"Suffering little children", for crying out loud.

55:15.911 --> 55:18.340
What is this little snot-nosed brat suffer?

55:18.383 --> 55:21.411
- I'm not a snot-nosed brat!
- You're not, huh?

55:21.482 --> 55:24.822
No, and the stuff you do is yucky. Beeh!

55:24.955 --> 55:28.929
That's right, Savannah, Alvie's a slop.
Now, place that right there.

55:29.499 --> 55:32.472
- You got that finished yet?
- Yes, we got it finished.

55:32.539 --> 55:34.152
No thanks to you.

55:34.332 --> 55:36.919
Then go out and mail it! Special delivery.

55:36.992 --> 55:39.499
You go out and mail it! We pasted it!

55:39.615 --> 55:42.761
All right, all right. And what if somebody shows up here?

55:43.128 --> 55:45.908
You're able to hide her? Well, are you?

55:46.608 --> 55:50.308
Okay, but you listen to me. 
You'll be nice to this kid while I'm gone. You hear me?

55:50.351 --> 55:52.715
Yeah, I hear ya! Now go, and mail that letter.

55:52.778 --> 55:54.384
All right, all right.

55:56.964 --> 55:58.651
That's one of them right there.

55:58.991 --> 55:59.991
Yeah.

56:00.231 --> 56:02.251
Good. Go ahead.

56:10.379 --> 56:11.666
There's the other one.

56:16.512 --> 56:18.112
- You sure?
- Yeah.

56:18.566 --> 56:21.886
- Then these are the same two that you saw?
- Yes.

56:23.019 --> 56:25.419
- Same one where you saw the little girl?
- That's right.

56:28.971 --> 56:30.871
This just came in over the telephone.

56:31.291 --> 56:35.585
One of the guards recognized McGaffee as the driver
of the car at the prison break.

56:35.628 --> 56:38.145
He was just released on parole a few weeks ago.

56:38.534 --> 56:41.814
That makes the situation take on
an even more serious aspect.

56:42.114 --> 56:47.367
The Driscoll child is in the hands of two desperate
criminals, and the report said they're not very brave.

56:47.694 --> 56:51.773
In a few weeks since the jail break, instead of hiding
out somewhere, they've committed grand theft,

56:51.816 --> 56:54.500
armed robbery, assault with a deadly weapon,
and kidnapping.

56:54.556 --> 56:59.303
Gentlemen, we've to do everything possible to apprehend
them before they can commit a more serious crime.

56:59.983 --> 57:01.850
What kind of water she's been drinking?

57:02.650 --> 57:05.317
Right out of the tap, just like us. We ain't sick.

57:06.010 --> 57:09.010
Doreen, I'm making out the description on your name.

57:09.757 --> 57:11.850
Just 24 of this oral.

57:13.690 --> 57:16.076
Give her the medicine as instructed and

57:16.217 --> 57:18.790
call me at once if the fever goes up again.

57:18.983 --> 57:20.023
Thanks, doc.

57:20.477 --> 57:23.543
You listen to me, doc, and you listen good.

57:23.656 --> 57:27.442
If you know what's good for you, you won't say
nothing to nobody about this. You understand?

57:27.485 --> 57:29.410
Don't threaten me, cowboy.

57:29.739 --> 57:32.872
All criminals are low types
and most crimes equally deplorable.

57:33.112 --> 57:36.999
- Kidnapping... that as low as a man can sink!
- We didn't kidnap this kid!

57:37.042 --> 57:39.925
- We found her in the back of our car.
- And why don't you give her back?

57:39.968 --> 57:42.585
Because we got that reward money coming to us.

57:42.628 --> 57:43.652
We earned it.

57:43.695 --> 57:47.795
- We just want a fair share like anybody else.
- Look, you give her to me...

57:47.955 --> 57:50.361
and will see if I can get the money to you through Doreen.

57:50.428 --> 57:52.548
You really think I'm a fool, don't you, doc?

57:52.628 --> 57:55.362
Well, I ain't! Boots, crab that kid. Let's get out of here.

57:55.508 --> 57:56.622
Thanks, Doreen.

57:56.788 --> 57:59.288
Be very careful. That child's life is in your hands.

58:01.328 --> 58:04.621
The grocery clerk identified the two men from the mug shot.

58:04.664 --> 58:08.580
So did officer Jamison, and now the Driscolls get
a ransom letter. What more do you want?

58:08.623 --> 58:10.969
This does not constitute a ransom letter.

58:11.012 --> 58:13.572
They're asking for reward, a reward which has been offered.

58:13.615 --> 58:18.188
That phone call of the clerk of the grocery store
tells us exactly the kind of men we're dealing with.

58:18.231 --> 58:19.415
Lieutenant,

58:19.751 --> 58:22.671
we all know any criminal can be dangerous.

58:22.775 --> 58:27.782
McGaffee is a second story man. He's a messy thief,
he's a pig fucker. I don't care much about him, but...

58:28.323 --> 58:31.596
Alvin Gibbs, on the other hand, has a hot temper.

58:31.639 --> 58:33.479
He can be violent when cornered.

58:33.522 --> 58:36.155
And being a hundred men doesn't help matters any.

58:36.268 --> 58:40.568
The only point I'm trying to make is,
what if these two men actually found the girl?

58:40.611 --> 58:43.172
As far as I'm concerned,
that doesn't make any difference at all.

58:43.214 --> 58:45.338
They got her, and we have to get her back.

58:50.449 --> 58:53.496
- You want some more potatoes?
- You bet I want.

58:54.056 --> 58:57.342
- I made them with cream and butter.
- It's the best I ever ate.

58:58.149 --> 59:00.649
I also baked a chocolate cake for dessert.

59:00.789 --> 59:03.016
Wow, I love chocolate cake.

59:03.236 --> 59:06.016
- It seems you're feeling better.
- Well, it sounds like it.

59:06.796 --> 59:09.435
- Want more potatoes?
- I'm eating, ain't I?

59:09.478 --> 59:11.276
- Want some more?
- Yeah, why not.

59:11.957 --> 59:15.479
- You really like my potatoes, don't you?
- Stop bothering me. I eat them, all right?

59:15.522 --> 59:18.833
<i>We interrupt our regular program
to bring you a special news bulletin.</i>

59:18.888 --> 59:23.888
<i>It has been five days of anguish for
Mr. and Mrs. Richard Driscoll of  Utah.</i>

59:23.931 --> 59:27.564
<i>Their six year old daughter Savannah
was apparently abducted Saturday</i>

59:27.607 --> 59:29.100
<i>after an innocent din...</i>

59:29.153 --> 59:30.607
What's abducted?

59:33.620 --> 59:35.140
Well, it means...

59:36.000 --> 59:39.233
It means they think we took you.

59:39.967 --> 59:41.994
But you didn't. I ran away.

59:43.260 --> 59:46.400
- You did? How come?
- There were lots of reasons.

59:46.720 --> 59:49.014
Mummy never made me potatoes.

59:50.240 --> 59:51.747
Poor kid.

59:54.774 --> 59:56.268
You want some more pork chops?

59:56.311 --> 01:00:00.534
- I love pork chops.
- Okay, so you really like my pork chops.

01:00:00.628 --> 01:00:04.957
- You like the way Bootsie fixes them.
- Would you stop and let her eat your pork chop?

01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:07.877
- You want some more potatoes?
- I sure do!

01:00:08.610 --> 01:00:10.577
She sure like these potatoes.

01:00:10.804 --> 01:00:14.264
- Do you like my potatoes, Alvie?
- Would you knocking off about the potatoes?

01:00:14.477 --> 01:00:19.203
- Hmm, yummy, yummy. Aren't these potatoes good, Savannah?
- Hmm hmm.

01:00:19.937 --> 01:00:21.877
I gotta hurry before I lose my job.

01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:25.843
- What work do you have?
- I'm working at the car wash.

01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:27.857
Well, I'll be damned.

01:00:28.110 --> 01:00:29.710
Somebody's got to pay the bills.

01:00:29.753 --> 01:00:31.470
How about washing the dishes for me?

01:00:32.353 --> 01:00:33.373
Bye, Savannah.

01:00:33.416 --> 01:00:34.979
- Bye bye, Bootsie.
- Bye bye, Bootsie.

01:00:35.505 --> 01:00:39.958
All I could think of was to ask this other man to give
me a glass of water and give the baby some aspirin.

01:00:40.018 --> 01:00:43.223
Good thinking, dioctor. At least now we have fingerprints.

01:00:43.266 --> 01:00:45.492
We can make a positive identification.

01:00:46.133 --> 01:00:50.132
Do you have any idea why Mrs. Lumous didn't contact us
when she first met that man?

01:00:50.653 --> 01:00:52.219
She said she was scared.

01:00:52.493 --> 01:00:54.186
She didn't want to get into trouble.

01:00:54.786 --> 01:00:57.373
Ans she really believed him about not taking the child.

01:00:57.426 --> 01:00:58.492
Well, that may be, doctor.

01:00:58.535 --> 01:01:02.215
But the fact is they have her, and they won't give
her back, unless someone gives them money,

01:01:02.257 --> 01:01:03.628
and that constitutes kidnapping.

01:01:04.008 --> 01:01:05.548
Did you ever had fights?

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:06.755
I did.

01:01:06.882 --> 01:01:10.622
This girl in the school pulled my hair,
and we got in a fight.

01:01:10.902 --> 01:01:12.022
Did you win?

01:01:12.402 --> 01:01:15.382
Nope. The teacher caught us, and she made us stop.

01:01:16.221 --> 01:01:17.227
All right.

01:01:17.614 --> 01:01:18.614
Now look.

01:01:18.802 --> 01:01:21.244
Next time some kid starts messing with you,

01:01:21.287 --> 01:01:22.447
here's what you do.

01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:24.007
Yell "Look out!"

01:01:24.463 --> 01:01:26.303
- You look over there somewhere, see?
- Mhmhm.

01:01:26.346 --> 01:01:29.539
Like somebody's coming up, but you only distract him. Right?

01:01:29.693 --> 01:01:32.386
- Then you step on her foot, hard as you can.
- Yeah.

01:01:32.429 --> 01:01:34.273
- That will be one moment, you see.
- Mhmhm.

01:01:34.526 --> 01:01:38.999
Then you grab her by the arm and you throw her like
a sack of potatoes on the ground, as hard as you can.

01:01:39.042 --> 01:01:40.126
Okay.

01:01:40.575 --> 01:01:42.749
Now, if you can remember all that,

01:01:43.175 --> 01:01:46.042
I promise you you won't lose no fights.

01:01:46.375 --> 01:01:48.675
Sure. Thanks, Alvie. Can I try it?

01:01:48.718 --> 01:01:51.475
As soon as Bootsie comes home, you practise on him.

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:06.926
Yeah?

01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:10.339
<i>Yeah, um, Mr. Driscoll? Listen,</i>

01:02:10.382 --> 01:02:14.108
I thought you would like to know,
Savannah is fine, she's fine.

01:02:16.315 --> 01:02:18.602
Listen, did you get the letter yet?

01:02:18.645 --> 01:02:22.298
Yes, I have the money in small notes in two bags,
just as you requested.

01:02:23.492 --> 01:02:25.498
- Are you still there.
- Uh, yeah.

01:02:25.625 --> 01:02:27.278
Listen,

01:02:27.491 --> 01:02:31.025
we don't want the money. We just wanna give Savannah back.

01:02:31.358 --> 01:02:32.359
<i>Okay?</i>

01:02:35.133 --> 01:02:38.460
- Yes, of course. Whatever you want.
- We don't want no problems

01:02:38.503 --> 01:02:40.676
- <i>from the police, see.</i>
- Fine. I understand.

01:02:40.828 --> 01:02:43.192
<i>Uh, about to get her back,</i>

01:02:43.235 --> 01:02:44.669
figure out when and where.

01:02:44.712 --> 01:02:47.372
And tell Savannah's mom not to worry.

01:02:47.415 --> 01:02:48.415
<i>Okay?</i>

01:02:54.485 --> 01:02:58.092
I'll take this recording to the station to analyze it later.

01:02:58.184 --> 01:02:59.337
What happened?

01:03:00.649 --> 01:03:03.942
They don't want the money anymore.
They just wanna give Savannah back.

01:03:05.129 --> 01:03:06.129
Why?

01:03:07.185 --> 01:03:08.638
I think they're scared.

01:03:09.665 --> 01:03:11.372
No, I think they're stalling.

01:03:11.598 --> 01:03:14.205
I almost forget... I've got something for you.

01:03:15.952 --> 01:03:17.125
What you're doing?

01:03:17.205 --> 01:03:18.752
Waiting for my present.

01:03:18.812 --> 01:03:19.829
Well...

01:03:19.872 --> 01:03:22.699
It ain't a present exactly,
just something I don't need no more.

01:03:22.742 --> 01:03:24.979
- Can I look now?
- Sure, go ahead.

01:03:26.015 --> 01:03:28.449
A harmonica!

01:03:28.555 --> 01:03:30.709
Jeez, thanks, Alvie.

01:03:36.209 --> 01:03:39.962
- I bet you got lots of presents, don't you?
- At Christmas I do.

01:03:40.096 --> 01:03:43.849
That moment they always leave me and go skiing some place.

01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:45.816
They always leave me.

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:47.696
And that's why I ran away.

01:03:47.762 --> 01:03:49.543
Yeah, I did, too, finally.

01:03:50.042 --> 01:03:52.122
But I've never gotten nothing at Christmas camp.

01:03:52.335 --> 01:03:53.515
Never?

01:03:54.089 --> 01:03:55.702
Well, yeah, once I did.

01:03:56.109 --> 01:03:59.642
- Once I got a package of firecrackers, and you what I did?
- What?

01:03:59.842 --> 01:04:01.675
Well, early the next morning

01:04:01.802 --> 01:04:06.189
I tiptoed in Donna Caludy's room
and I lit that whole package of firecrackers,

01:04:06.435 --> 01:04:08.795
and I tossed them suckers under the bed.

01:04:09.069 --> 01:04:13.055
It was like the devil with a pump gun were behind them.

01:04:13.335 --> 01:04:20.055
They jumped skyhigh, they ran in each other, and into
the wall, down, down. I'll remeber that my whole life.

01:04:21.179 --> 01:04:27.059
And then they chased me through the corn field
and into the woods, but they never caught me.

01:04:27.389 --> 01:04:29.163
That's funny, Alvie.

01:04:29.422 --> 01:04:30.429
Yeah.

01:04:30.472 --> 01:04:32.296
And that was on Saturday.

01:04:33.649 --> 01:04:35.295
And when I came out of the woods,

01:04:35.535 --> 01:04:39.535
them and all those kids were piling that old pickup truck,

01:04:39.662 --> 01:04:41.089
going into town.

01:04:41.555 --> 01:04:44.235
And I ran and ran as hard as I could

01:04:44.615 --> 01:04:46.555
but all I caught was their dust.

01:04:47.261 --> 01:04:49.169
And they did this every Saturday.

01:04:49.755 --> 01:04:51.509
Always ran off and let me.

01:04:52.237 --> 01:04:53.917
I cried like a girl.

01:04:54.531 --> 01:04:56.051
I would have grown up then,

01:04:56.877 --> 01:04:58.891
but I didn't know I was supposed to cry.

01:05:00.182 --> 01:05:02.129
They didn't come back for the next days,

01:05:02.269 --> 01:05:06.576
and when they came back they beat me so hard
that I hardly couldn't stand up.

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:10.140
That was when I finally ran off the grid. I was then

01:05:10.946 --> 01:05:12.872
ten, eleven years old,

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.693
and I've been on my own ever since.

01:05:15.353 --> 01:05:16.820
Poor Alvie.

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.280
Oh, yeah,

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.533
that was a long time ago.

01:05:20.986 --> 01:05:22.546
And I didn't think about that

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:24.553
ever no more.

01:06:18.269 --> 01:06:19.709
What do you think you're doing?

01:06:19.856 --> 01:06:22.369
Making all that noise and leaving the door unlocked?

01:06:22.412 --> 01:06:25.489
A hobbyhorse! It's so cute!

01:06:25.772 --> 01:06:30.639
- It has a real mane and a real tail.
- Where've you learned to play the harmonica?

01:06:30.682 --> 01:06:33.186
Up at Joliet, long time back.

01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:35.962
Let's find out if Savannah is a horses addict.

01:06:36.135 --> 01:06:37.395
Hey, Savannah!

01:06:37.455 --> 01:06:39.415
Let's show Bootsie what we've learned today.

01:06:39.458 --> 01:06:40.848
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:06:43.154 --> 01:06:47.774
Okay. We've got into a fight because you're pulling my hair.

01:06:47.817 --> 01:06:50.163
- Pulling your hair?
- Yeah, right here.

01:06:50.206 --> 01:06:51.524
Okay. This hair right here?

01:06:51.567 --> 01:06:54.479
- Look over here!
- Where? Ouch!

01:06:57.161 --> 01:06:59.534
My god, she's almost killing me.

01:07:04.374 --> 01:07:09.293
Hey, we've so much fun now,
it could be bedtime the whole life.

01:07:09.887 --> 01:07:11.340
You want a bed?

01:09:12.233 --> 01:09:14.459
We sure did a good thing coming up here, didn't we?

01:09:14.502 --> 01:09:16.099
We sure as hell did.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:27.027
- Alvie, cops!
- Get the kid. Get the kid!

01:09:37.153 --> 01:09:39.658
Come back to us now.

01:09:39.702 --> 01:09:41.540
- ...
- Hey!

01:09:41.746 --> 01:09:43.466
- Come on!
- Over here!

01:09:49.948 --> 01:09:53.843
Hey! Will you get over here? Everybody! Come on!

01:09:54.708 --> 01:09:59.501
♪ Rye whiskey, rye whiskey, rye whiskey I cry ♪

01:09:59.544 --> 01:10:04.290
♪ If I don't get rye whiskey, I think I will die ♪

01:10:04.377 --> 01:10:09.383
- ♪ If the ocean was whiskey and I was a duck ♪
- Quack, quack.

01:10:09.426 --> 01:10:12.852
♪ I'd dive to the bottom to get one sweet suck ♪

01:10:18.052 --> 01:10:19.592
I'll go get some ice cream.

01:10:21.631 --> 01:10:23.058
Come on, Savannah.

01:10:24.925 --> 01:10:28.719
- Isn't that very much pretty, huh?
- Wow!

01:10:29.482 --> 01:10:30.869
Ain't that something?

01:10:31.095 --> 01:10:32.209
It's beautiful.

01:10:32.815 --> 01:10:34.135
Look way up there.

01:10:36.129 --> 01:10:39.202
Can I have three chocolate ice cream cones, please?

01:10:40.422 --> 01:10:42.462
Say, how high them falls?

01:10:42.715 --> 01:10:45.155
About 1700 feet.

01:10:45.442 --> 01:10:47.549
There's the deepest trail in the world.

01:10:48.615 --> 01:10:50.582
Umm, by the way...

01:10:50.989 --> 01:10:54.501
Is there a road that goes up to the top there?

01:10:54.549 --> 01:10:58.362
Well, there's a narrow dirt road,
but it winds round for hours.

01:10:59.642 --> 01:11:00.895
Son of a gun.

01:11:01.635 --> 01:11:04.549
Hey, by the way, do you want a puppy?

01:11:05.062 --> 01:11:06.068
A puppy?

01:11:06.731 --> 01:11:07.911
There're free.

01:11:08.818 --> 01:11:09.858
A puppy.

01:11:12.124 --> 01:11:14.063
Oh, there comes Alvie.

01:11:14.344 --> 01:11:15.644
There you go.

01:11:17.184 --> 01:11:19.477
One for you, one for you, and one for me.

01:11:22.097 --> 01:11:24.877
- What's that?
- What's what? I don't hear nothing.

01:11:25.291 --> 01:11:27.670
Well, I do, Alvie. You're making weird noises.

01:11:27.744 --> 01:11:29.483
Sounds like a puppy.

01:11:30.184 --> 01:11:31.664
Oh, my gosh.

01:11:31.824 --> 01:11:32.844
What...

01:11:34.224 --> 01:11:37.357
It's a puppy, all right? How did that get in there?

01:11:37.857 --> 01:11:41.410
- For me?
- Sure. I ain't got no use for a puppy.

01:11:41.453 --> 01:11:43.077
Thank you, Alvie.

01:11:49.519 --> 01:11:50.979
My little puppy.

01:11:56.273 --> 01:11:58.246
That is the car we search.

01:11:58.433 --> 01:12:02.393
<i>Central 605. We found the car in the area.</i>

01:12:04.974 --> 01:12:08.161
Don't ever get in a car or even talk to strangers. Okay?

01:12:08.494 --> 01:12:10.488
Next time you might not be so lucky.

01:12:11.774 --> 01:12:13.001
I'll remember.

01:12:14.121 --> 01:12:15.561
Good night, Bootsie.

01:12:16.001 --> 01:12:17.594
Good night, Alvie.

01:12:18.048 --> 01:12:20.894
Thanks for the puppy, and thanks for the picknick.

01:12:23.186 --> 01:12:24.733
- Good night, honey.
- Good night, kid.

01:12:30.154 --> 01:12:32.547
It's a lone kid's plan who wear out.

01:12:35.737 --> 01:12:37.491
I ain't gonna steal anymore.

01:12:40.484 --> 01:12:41.824
Well, you won't have to,

01:12:42.104 --> 01:12:43.844
after we get that reward, buddy.

01:12:45.124 --> 01:12:46.831
You're gonna get mad, Alvie, but...

01:12:48.505 --> 01:12:49.865
I gotta tell you something.

01:12:50.597 --> 01:12:52.157
Well, all right.

01:12:52.597 --> 01:12:55.204
But if I'm gonna get mad, we better do it in the other room.

01:12:55.247 --> 01:12:57.517
We don't want to wake up this little kid up. Come on.

01:13:17.342 --> 01:13:19.795
All right. Shoot.

01:13:22.728 --> 01:13:24.242
We gotta give the kid back.

01:13:25.493 --> 01:13:27.313
We are going to give the kid back.

01:13:29.113 --> 01:13:30.733
Without the reward money.

01:13:33.391 --> 01:13:35.091
What the hell are you talking about?

01:13:36.851 --> 01:13:38.244
Look, Alvie...

01:13:38.771 --> 01:13:41.043
- What if she was our own kid?
- She ain't our kid.

01:13:41.086 --> 01:13:43.784
Well, suppose she was our kid and somebody took her.

01:13:44.346 --> 01:13:47.333
And we didn't what terrible things
might be happening to her.

01:13:47.386 --> 01:13:48.533
How who you feel?

01:13:48.993 --> 01:13:50.019
Listen, bro...

01:13:50.739 --> 01:13:53.526
I've been waiting my whole life for something like this.

01:13:53.919 --> 01:13:55.206
It's a hundred grand.

01:13:55.473 --> 01:13:57.459
100,000 bucks!

01:14:02.591 --> 01:14:04.104
Alvie, I called her dad.

01:14:05.791 --> 01:14:07.771
You did? Why would you do that?

01:14:08.004 --> 01:14:09.911
I told him we wanna to give her back

01:14:10.177 --> 01:14:11.851
with no strings attached.

01:14:12.571 --> 01:14:13.817
You did what?

01:14:15.784 --> 01:14:18.244
What in the hell did you do that for?

01:14:19.811 --> 01:14:21.344
I told you you would be mad.

01:14:21.857 --> 01:14:25.897
<i>Good morning everybody.
It's early morning right here.</i>

01:14:25.963 --> 01:14:29.149
<i>Let's hear a music of your favorite country
in this early morning.</i>

01:14:33.298 --> 01:14:35.311
Take up your positions as we planned.

01:14:36.044 --> 01:14:40.571
I want you to isolate Gibbs and take him if you can,
but the little girl must be nowhere near him.

01:14:40.614 --> 01:14:42.226
It has to be a perfect shot, understood?

01:14:42.269 --> 01:14:43.462
- Got it.
- Yes, sir.

01:14:43.547 --> 01:14:45.120
<i>...</i>

01:14:45.174 --> 01:14:47.227
<i>...</i>

01:14:47.974 --> 01:14:49.984
<i>...</i>

01:14:50.027 --> 01:14:53.807
<i>...</i>

01:14:53.850 --> 01:14:56.501
<i>...</i>

01:14:57.250 --> 01:14:59.210
<i>...</i>

01:14:59.697 --> 01:15:04.477
<i>...</i>

01:15:04.830 --> 01:15:06.670
<i>...</i>

01:15:12.699 --> 01:15:15.226
<i>...</i>

01:15:15.269 --> 01:15:18.739
Now, if we could pick off Gibbs,
I'm sure McGaffee will give up.

01:15:18.782 --> 01:15:20.542
I don't like that you're going in there.

01:15:20.585 --> 01:15:23.689
I kind of understand how you feel about the girl,
but these guys are stalling.

01:15:23.732 --> 01:15:26.358
Gibbs is dangerous. We can't afford to take a chance.

01:15:26.718 --> 01:15:28.865
Bill, he's armed.

01:15:29.838 --> 01:15:30.872
I know that.

01:15:31.265 --> 01:15:32.785
I still don't like it.

01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:36.690
They offer to give the girl back,
and they don't want the reward.

01:15:36.817 --> 01:15:40.710
- What's the matter? You're getting soft?
- No, but I'm not a murderer, either.

01:15:40.844 --> 01:15:43.270
Neither am I, but time has run out.

01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:47.316
I've never lost a case,
and I'm sure that I'm not gonna lose this one.

01:15:52.584 --> 01:15:55.091
Hey, what's the matter?

01:15:55.134 --> 01:15:56.573
I had a bad dream.

01:16:05.411 --> 01:16:06.758
How did they get here?

01:16:10.688 --> 01:16:12.435
Did you see anything? Is she there?

01:16:12.478 --> 01:16:14.768
Right that way is your pussycat.

01:16:14.811 --> 01:16:16.005
Don't kid yourself.

01:16:38.648 --> 01:16:40.261
What's gonna happen? What's the plan?

01:16:41.155 --> 01:16:43.808
We gonna isolate Gibbs.

01:16:45.541 --> 01:16:46.781
You're trying to shoot him?

01:16:46.824 --> 01:16:51.024
It's the only way we can be sure of getting your daughter
back unharmed. That man is a desperate criminal.

01:16:51.066 --> 01:16:53.566
No, nobody is gonna shoot at that house. Do you understand?

01:17:55.524 --> 01:17:56.525
Hey.

01:17:56.757 --> 01:17:57.871
Guess what.

01:17:58.351 --> 01:18:00.804
Bootsie has a big surprise for you today.

01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:02.757
And Bootsie gets you ready for it.

01:18:03.497 --> 01:18:04.544
Okay.

01:18:19.558 --> 01:18:21.058
Where did that come from?

01:18:22.032 --> 01:18:24.565
Outside! Somebody shot at me! Missed me by a hair!

01:18:24.608 --> 01:18:26.258
- We gotta get out of here.
- Get the kid!

01:18:26.645 --> 01:18:28.191
- What happened?
- Nothing.

01:18:28.234 --> 01:18:30.398
Nothing. Everything's just fine. Okay?

01:18:30.441 --> 01:18:32.212
Uh, we just gonna play a game.

01:18:32.255 --> 01:18:34.895
- Yeah. You remeber king Boris?
- Uhuh.

01:18:34.938 --> 01:18:36.628
- And the wicked witch?
- Yeah.

01:18:36.671 --> 01:18:39.811
Well, they're attacking us right now. Yeah.

01:18:39.870 --> 01:18:42.218
So we have to defend the castle. Okay?

01:18:42.261 --> 01:18:45.643
- Are there any bad dragons?
- Oh, lots of bad dragons.

01:18:46.614 --> 01:18:48.394
Somebody shot at Gibbs and missed.

01:18:48.481 --> 01:18:52.826
- Why? Who did this? Who's in charge here?
- Keep cool. It's a very messy situation.

01:18:52.869 --> 01:18:55.376
I'm gonna handle it. Give me that bullhorn!

01:18:55.419 --> 01:18:57.263
You lousy rotten bastards!

01:18:57.306 --> 01:18:59.379
What are you tying to do? Kill somebody?

01:18:59.422 --> 01:19:00.779
There's a kid in here!

01:19:01.226 --> 01:19:03.879
Nobody wants to kill anybody.

01:19:03.922 --> 01:19:06.802
- Now let's talk this over.
- No, sir!

01:19:06.882 --> 01:19:09.955
We made a deal that you broke now! So we shut it off!

01:19:10.062 --> 01:19:12.029
And nobody gonna try to stop us!

01:19:12.072 --> 01:19:14.189
And when I'm coming out of here, I wanna see nobody!

01:19:14.232 --> 01:19:15.598
And I mean, nobody!

01:19:17.258 --> 01:19:20.238
Officers, clear the area. Clear!

01:19:31.728 --> 01:19:33.121
Do you see the dragons?

01:19:33.335 --> 01:19:35.001
- They're right there.
- Where?

01:19:35.095 --> 01:19:36.981
- Right there.
- Look over there!

01:19:37.708 --> 01:19:39.188
And there's one right there.

01:19:39.908 --> 01:19:41.314
Okay, keep your eye on them.

01:19:41.357 --> 01:19:42.841
- There's one there.
- Where, where?

01:19:42.884 --> 01:19:44.944
- And here's one over here.
- Oh, okay.

01:19:44.987 --> 01:19:47.727
- Oh, that one is big.
- Watch for the king now.

01:19:47.894 --> 01:19:49.654
He's around here some place.

01:19:50.047 --> 01:19:53.807
- All right. Right. Now don't get spooked.
- Okay.

01:19:53.887 --> 01:19:56.874
If we all stuck together,
nothing will happen to us. All right?

01:19:56.917 --> 01:19:59.594
- Just stay close.
- But I am close. Let's go.

01:20:00.837 --> 01:20:01.903
There's Savannah.

01:20:02.730 --> 01:20:06.536
Yeah, don't worry about him because we'll fool him.

01:20:06.579 --> 01:20:09.863
- Can I hold the flag?
- No, it's not your turn yet.

01:20:10.246 --> 01:20:11.773
What are you doing?

01:20:11.816 --> 01:20:13.682
Well, I'm trying to open the door! Will you...

01:20:13.725 --> 01:20:18.023
Lord, there're pouring cops out here, and we're standing
around while you're trying to get the car open!

01:20:18.066 --> 01:20:20.559
- Give that cotton to the kid!
- Here, honey, it's your turn.

01:20:20.602 --> 01:20:22.132
Hold it up, honey, hold it high.

01:20:22.202 --> 01:20:23.228
Here.

01:20:24.169 --> 01:20:26.029
Would you just go...

01:20:28.622 --> 01:20:31.195
Wait. Could you just wait until...

01:20:34.422 --> 01:20:35.875
Oh, don't push hard.

01:20:36.022 --> 01:20:38.095
- Get in the car!
- Wait a minute.

01:20:38.138 --> 01:20:39.155
What is this for?

01:20:40.245 --> 01:20:42.071
Just get off my leg.

01:20:42.818 --> 01:20:43.871
Move on!

01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:53.157
Why can't you get a get-away car that we could get away?

01:20:53.690 --> 01:20:55.217
Don't be mad, Alvie.

01:20:55.316 --> 01:20:56.869
Can't we just take her?

01:20:57.117 --> 01:20:58.464
I'm gonna see if I can help.

01:20:59.230 --> 01:21:01.044
Don't try to be a hero, father!

01:21:01.087 --> 01:21:02.497
- Lord of mercy.
- Fellas.

01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:04.760
There comes a dude in a long black skirt.

01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:06.620
It's no dude, it's a priest.

01:21:07.033 --> 01:21:08.213
Wait a minute.

01:21:08.486 --> 01:21:10.173
It's the priest I saw on television.

01:21:10.446 --> 01:21:12.246
That's father Ohara.

01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:15.033
Hi, father.

01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:17.286
- Hi, father.
- Hello, padre.

01:21:18.006 --> 01:21:20.646
- How you're doing?
- Oh, fine, fine.

01:21:21.146 --> 01:21:22.786
How are you, Savannah?

01:21:22.946 --> 01:21:24.346
I'm fine!

01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:26.120
- And you know what?
- What?

01:21:26.163 --> 01:21:29.353
I went on a picknick and I got a puppy.

01:21:29.402 --> 01:21:31.929
Oh, that's fine, real fine.

01:21:32.309 --> 01:21:33.615
My sons...

01:21:34.002 --> 01:21:35.729
I want you to trust me, huh.

01:21:36.015 --> 01:21:38.249
I'd like to let me help you if I can.

01:21:38.602 --> 01:21:42.495
Well, you can, padre.
You can get behind this car here and give us a push.

01:21:43.135 --> 01:21:45.335
Don't you wanna give Savannah to me right now?

01:21:45.378 --> 01:21:49.099
No, sir. They had their chance and they blew it.
Now you get back there and give us a startup.

01:21:49.142 --> 01:21:50.701
- You, too, Boots. Go help him.
- Me?

01:21:50.744 --> 01:21:53.489
And you stay here. The mad king Boris is out there.

01:21:53.949 --> 01:21:56.583
The mad king Boris.

01:21:57.836 --> 01:21:59.942
Okay, father, on three. Ready?

01:21:59.985 --> 01:22:02.863
One, two, three!

01:22:03.849 --> 01:22:05.343
What are they doing now?

01:22:06.483 --> 01:22:09.049
It looks like they're pushing the car.

01:22:17.059 --> 01:22:20.019
- Don't you wanna go with them?
- Wait for me!

01:22:32.350 --> 01:22:33.463
Get in, padre!

01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:36.870
- Oh, no, I could not got away.
- Get in!

01:22:36.913 --> 01:22:38.217
All right, but...

01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:42.520
I suppose you could drop me off.

01:23:01.304 --> 01:23:03.677
They're in an unmarked car.

01:23:04.004 --> 01:23:07.184
Don't push anything,
and don't let them get out of your sight.

01:23:07.411 --> 01:23:11.450
If that's the way they wanna play the game,
we want that reward, padre!

01:23:11.493 --> 01:23:12.711
Fine, fine.

01:23:12.873 --> 01:23:15.653
After the ceremony we'll work something out.

01:23:41.705 --> 01:23:44.812
Sorry. Sorry. I'm really sorry.

01:23:44.865 --> 01:23:46.212
So sorry.

01:23:49.132 --> 01:23:51.765
I'm so sorry. Where are we?

01:23:54.425 --> 01:24:01.058
Ah. Now that Dorothy and Donald had given
themselves to each other bu solemn vows

01:24:01.101 --> 01:24:04.227
with the joining of hands and the
giving and receiving of a ring,

01:24:04.270 --> 01:24:10.090
I pronounce that theu're husband and wife
in the name of the father, the son, and of the holy spirit.

01:24:51.595 --> 01:24:53.462
<i>...</i>

01:24:53.762 --> 01:24:55.189

01:24:56.462 --> 01:24:59.702
The ceremony is over and there's no sign of the suspects.
We'll check it out.

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:16.387
And, padre, remember... Tell them, no cops.

01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:25.129
I just found this note in the bedroom.

01:25:27.655 --> 01:25:29.282
- You showed this to anybody?
- No.

01:25:32.975 --> 01:25:33.982
Hello.

01:25:38.082 --> 01:25:40.335
Yes, father, I understand. We'll be right there.

01:25:46.009 --> 01:25:47.283
They wanna give her back.

01:25:47.823 --> 01:25:51.749
I don't think we should mention this to anybody.
It would just complicate things at this point.

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:03.586
- Okay, they're there.
- Let's go.

01:27:15.063 --> 01:27:16.836
Are you okay, puppy?

01:27:22.429 --> 01:27:23.802
Oh, puppy.

01:27:25.496 --> 01:27:28.302
Bootsie, my puppy has to go to the bathroom.

01:27:29.406 --> 01:27:30.892
Okay, honey.

01:27:36.909 --> 01:27:38.470
Just let him go right over there.

01:27:44.523 --> 01:27:45.863
Here you go.

01:27:46.343 --> 01:27:48.057
Come on, puppy, come on.

01:27:48.283 --> 01:27:52.249
Come on. Come on, puppy. Come on. Come on.

01:28:15.645 --> 01:28:16.865
Where's Savannah?

01:28:16.908 --> 01:28:20.418
- Oh, no. Savannah. Where's she?
- She's fine, fine.

01:28:20.461 --> 01:28:23.207
- Where is she?
- She's up there on top, but she's fine.

01:28:23.250 --> 01:28:24.650
Why didn't you bring her back down?

01:28:24.692 --> 01:28:28.539
I just wanted to make sure there's no dumb stunts
like happened this morning.

01:28:28.776 --> 01:28:31.709
We did out part of the bargain.
If you want count the money... here!

01:28:32.689 --> 01:28:34.049
You can keep your money!

01:28:34.822 --> 01:28:37.802
All we want is to give Savannah back, save and sound.

01:28:38.002 --> 01:28:39.436
You can keep the bargain.

01:28:39.549 --> 01:28:41.582
No charges and no cops.

01:28:41.869 --> 01:28:43.009
You have my word.

01:28:43.562 --> 01:28:46.289
And you all take good care of that kid from now on.

01:28:46.636 --> 01:28:48.302
What does that supposed to mean?

01:28:49.122 --> 01:28:50.168
We will.

01:28:51.908 --> 01:28:53.128
Come on, padre.

01:29:13.382 --> 01:29:15.142
Pruitt, we're right here.

01:29:15.859 --> 01:29:17.046
Everything's fine.

01:29:17.665 --> 01:29:18.665
Who?

01:29:20.652 --> 01:29:21.652
A few?

01:29:24.065 --> 01:29:25.125
Bring them up.

01:29:27.977 --> 01:29:30.110
All units, start to move in.

01:29:41.281 --> 01:29:42.374
Savannah.

01:29:43.194 --> 01:29:44.201
Savannah.

01:29:44.541 --> 01:29:46.988
Well, Boots, the coast is clear. Where's the kid?

01:29:47.031 --> 01:29:48.834
She was here just a minute ago.

01:29:48.934 --> 01:29:50.861
What did you do? Just let her wander off?

01:29:51.434 --> 01:29:54.174
I'll find her, don't worry.
She just took her dog to the bathroom.

01:29:54.388 --> 01:29:56.581
This is no place for a kid to get lost!

01:29:56.654 --> 01:30:01.643
Look, fellas. I think you've to leave now while you still
got a chance. I'll find her. Please, go!

01:30:01.686 --> 01:30:05.390
We can't just ran off and leave her!
She could get hurt up here! I gotta find her!

01:30:07.099 --> 01:30:08.253
Savannah!

01:30:08.296 --> 01:30:09.376
Savannah!

01:30:09.759 --> 01:30:10.819
Savannah!

01:30:11.925 --> 01:30:13.165
Savannah!

01:30:13.832 --> 01:30:14.919
Savannah!

01:30:16.359 --> 01:30:18.192
I've no idea what they're doing out there.

01:30:18.235 --> 01:30:19.865
They'll be down in a few minutes.

01:30:25.564 --> 01:30:26.611
Savannah!

01:30:27.137 --> 01:30:28.211
Savannah!

01:30:28.951 --> 01:30:29.964
Savannah!

01:30:32.524 --> 01:30:34.151
Savannah!

01:30:37.617 --> 01:30:38.764
Savannah!

01:30:40.404 --> 01:30:42.717
Could I use this phone, please? Thank you.

01:30:44.724 --> 01:30:48.044
Yes, Mr. Driscoll, please. He should be right there.

01:30:49.470 --> 01:30:51.717
- Mr. Driscoll?
- Yes. Thank you.

01:30:52.024 --> 01:30:53.064
Hello.

01:30:53.251 --> 01:30:54.317
<i>Richard?</i>

01:30:54.644 --> 01:30:58.104
Richard, I don't want you to be too alarmed, but...

01:30:58.477 --> 01:31:00.417
<i>Savannah has wandered off.</i>

01:31:00.571 --> 01:31:03.511
<i>Everything's going to be fine. Don't worry, we'll find her.</i>

01:31:03.554 --> 01:31:04.564
Father...

01:31:05.227 --> 01:31:06.227
Thank you.

01:31:10.137 --> 01:31:12.084
- She's lost.
- What?

01:31:12.127 --> 01:31:13.440
I've to got everybody up there.

01:31:13.513 --> 01:31:16.066
- Can you get this mashine running?
- Did you call the police?

01:31:16.109 --> 01:31:19.182
- Richard, did you call the police?
- I had no choice.

01:31:19.225 --> 01:31:23.371
No choice? What are you talking about?
Our choice is to get that child!

01:31:31.809 --> 01:31:35.322
- Freeze!
- Hey! Look, hey!

01:31:35.516 --> 01:31:37.989
- Come here!
- Over here!

01:31:38.049 --> 01:31:40.342
- Move it! Have you seen the kid?
- Where's the other one?

01:31:47.050 --> 01:31:48.083
It's him down there.

01:31:49.123 --> 01:31:50.523
<i>...</i>

01:31:51.203 --> 01:31:52.530
Go over there.

01:31:56.430 --> 01:31:57.730
Go around behind him.

01:31:57.930 --> 01:31:58.930
Sir!

01:32:03.195 --> 01:32:05.595
<i>You poor little puppy.</i>

01:32:05.775 --> 01:32:08.381
<i>I'll be with you all my life.</i>

01:32:09.162 --> 01:32:12.321
I can call you puppy, can't I?

01:32:18.409 --> 01:32:19.409
Hey!

01:32:22.402 --> 01:32:23.463
What happened?

01:32:25.881 --> 01:32:27.428
You've found him, did you?

01:32:27.508 --> 01:32:28.668
He's all wet.

01:32:29.301 --> 01:32:30.308
Here.

01:32:30.735 --> 01:32:32.455
Dry him off with this wrinkle.

01:32:37.434 --> 01:32:39.187
Dispatcher, Savage.

01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:42.334
Turn all action and communication to chief Pruitt.

01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:44.147
He stopped shivering yet?

01:32:44.247 --> 01:32:47.254
- When you get children, will you have it back?
- No, no.

01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:50.674
As child we had puppies. It was dirty like a pig.

01:32:52.032 --> 01:32:53.419
How did it get clean?

01:32:53.739 --> 01:32:54.745
Well...

01:32:54.819 --> 01:32:56.625
My mama used to lick them clean.

01:32:57.132 --> 01:32:59.259
- Should I lick him?
- No.

01:32:59.612 --> 01:33:02.092
This bath he did, that will do fine.

01:33:02.944 --> 01:33:06.171
- Who are those people up there?
- Well, they...

01:33:06.845 --> 01:33:08.492
We thought you was lost and...

01:33:08.738 --> 01:33:10.865
they all came up here to help us looking for you.

01:33:11.678 --> 01:33:14.498
- Gee, have I now many trouble?
- No.

01:33:15.031 --> 01:33:16.257
Where's Bootsie?

01:33:18.077 --> 01:33:19.637
He must be here somewhere.

01:33:20.531 --> 01:33:21.684
He won't be long.

01:33:22.477 --> 01:33:24.097
What's my surprise?

01:33:25.889 --> 01:33:28.782
Well, it didn't turn out exactly we've planned it.

01:33:30.082 --> 01:33:31.149
I'm sorry.

01:33:33.768 --> 01:33:34.808
Savannah...

01:33:37.181 --> 01:33:38.815
our vacation is over,

01:33:39.314 --> 01:33:41.074
and Bootsie and me have to go back there.

01:33:42.194 --> 01:33:44.887
We can't play together and have fun anymore?

01:33:45.767 --> 01:33:47.727
Oh, sure we can, someday maybe, but...

01:33:47.954 --> 01:33:52.194
the time has come when playing and games is over,
and everybody's getting back home.

01:33:53.854 --> 01:33:54.981
But that's all right.

01:33:55.054 --> 01:33:56.734
We had a real good time.

01:33:57.407 --> 01:34:00.674
- We have a good time, haven't we?
- We sure have, Alvie.

01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:02.480
Hey.

01:34:02.927 --> 01:34:04.660
If you like, I'll you give a back ride.

01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:06.340
Yeah.

01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:08.334
Come on.

01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:10.754
Give me the puppy. You hold on tight.

01:34:14.047 --> 01:34:15.081
You're on?

01:34:15.124 --> 01:34:16.220
- I am.
- Oaky.

01:34:48.742 --> 01:34:51.441
<i>...</i>

01:34:51.502 --> 01:34:55.001
- What did you got?
- Why didn't you tell us Savannah was save?

01:34:55.044 --> 01:34:56.155
But she wasn't.

01:34:59.348 --> 01:35:02.435
No, no, don't go down there. He's got a gun, Mrs. Driscoll.

01:35:04.321 --> 01:35:06.854
Let me go down there. He isn't gonna shoot anyone.

01:35:13.410 --> 01:35:14.837
You agree with her, don't you?

01:35:59.477 --> 01:36:00.924
Mummy!

01:36:00.977 --> 01:36:02.864
Oh, mummy!

01:36:03.024 --> 01:36:04.217
Oh, my baby.

01:36:19.112 --> 01:36:20.165
Alvie!

01:36:22.198 --> 01:36:23.205
I'm your friend.

01:36:24.085 --> 01:36:25.892
I could use a friend, padre.

01:36:27.125 --> 01:36:28.591
Maybe you ought to take this.

01:36:29.632 --> 01:36:30.778
It ain't loaded.

01:36:32.504 --> 01:36:34.871
- Stay close to me.
- Don't worry. I will.

01:36:43.373 --> 01:36:45.093
Freeze! Put your hands behind the head!

01:37:12.996 --> 01:37:15.289
- There's dad. Go ahead.
- Easy.

01:37:16.036 --> 01:37:17.389
Oh, sweetheart.

01:37:18.349 --> 01:37:19.736
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

01:37:22.915 --> 01:37:24.435
Bootsie!

01:37:32.232 --> 01:37:33.639
Goodbye, Bootsie.

01:37:34.012 --> 01:37:36.292
- Goodbye, honey.
- I've to go home now.

01:37:37.145 --> 01:37:39.985
- I know.
- You're not mad at me?

01:37:40.312 --> 01:37:41.625
Of couse not.

01:37:42.485 --> 01:37:44.538
Will you come and see me?

01:37:45.345 --> 01:37:46.645
I'll sure try.

01:37:48.018 --> 01:37:49.051
You promise?

01:37:50.244 --> 01:37:51.384
I promise.

01:37:51.871 --> 01:37:52.957
Won't forget?

01:37:54.444 --> 01:37:55.671
Not a chance.

01:38:15.323 --> 01:38:16.462
Here, honey.

01:38:17.029 --> 01:38:19.402
- I'm glad everything worked out all right.
- Yes, chief.

01:38:20.776 --> 01:38:23.956
I'd like to take my daughter home, chief Pruitt.
Could you drive us, please?

01:38:26.769 --> 01:38:27.896
Goodbye, Richard.

01:38:29.743 --> 01:38:30.816
Come on.

01:38:33.843 --> 01:38:36.703
No doubt you should be very proud.

01:38:36.816 --> 01:38:38.456
You still have a perfect record.

01:39:32.737 --> 01:39:35.643
I hope nobody ever tells her that we're bad guys.

01:39:37.257 --> 01:39:39.130
It won't make no difference.
