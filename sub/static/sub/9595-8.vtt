You know
that cough isn't even real?

17:34.754 --> 17:36.087
[ scoffs ]
[ chuckles ]

17:36.089 --> 17:37.755
She just uses it
to get attention.

17:37.757 --> 17:40.658
You know, growing up, as kids,
when she wasn't around,

17:40.660 --> 17:42.326
We would call her
"coughy klatch."

17:42.328 --> 17:43.327

[ coughs mockingly ]

17:47.834 --> 17:49.400
Okay, please, no more.
Please, no more.

17:49.402 --> 17:52.770
<i>So, like a good husband,</i>
<i>I held strong</i>

17:52.772 --> 17:56.441
<i>And slept with my wife</i>
<i>instead of my mom.</i>

17:56.443 --> 17:58.443
Hold your head down,
baby.

17:58.445 --> 18:01.546
Be real still.
Let grandma get you kitschy.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.514
What's going on?

18:03.516 --> 18:04.682
Oh, hey, bow.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.451
You know, I thought it over
last night,

18:06.453 --> 18:07.819
And I just want to say
I'm sorry.

18:07.821 --> 18:11.189
It was not my place
to do what I did,

18:11.191 --> 18:12.723
So I'm undoing it.

18:12.725 --> 18:15.760
Thank you...Ruby.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.362
A woman shouldn't have to feel
riled up in her own home.

[ dishes clatter ]

18:19.632 --> 18:21.766
You have
got to be kidding me!

18:21.768 --> 18:23.768
Bow, I was trying
to help, baby.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.803
Ooh, this is messy!

18:25.805 --> 18:29.607
See, that's why me and dre
keep it absolutely 100.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.509
Ha ha! No secrets.

18:31.511 --> 18:32.844
Well...
Oh -- really?

18:32.846 --> 18:36.514
So you<i> know</i> that he calls you
"coughy klatch"

Mama, I was just --

18:47.894 --> 18:50.394
Damn it, bow,
how could you tell her that?

18:50.396 --> 18:52.230
"coughy klatch"
was between<i> us!</i>

18:52.232 --> 18:53.831
Now you know
how it feels.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.299
Oh --

18:56.335 --> 18:58.469
Great timing, dad.
Really.

19:03.675 --> 19:06.444
<i>So, after getting</i>
<i>three combs and a brush</i>

19:06.446 --> 19:07.812
<i>Stuck in diane's hair,</i>

Stop tugging!
She's tender-headed.

19:13.887 --> 19:17.155

[ sighs ]
I really screwed this up, zo.

19:19.626 --> 19:20.758
Yeah, you really did.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.461
By trying to make
mom and grandma equal,

19:23.463 --> 19:25.830
You've created
an emotional half-fro.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.632
Interesting metaphor.

19:27.634 --> 19:29.700
Yeah, here's the thing
about girls, dad --

19:29.702 --> 19:31.802
You can only have one number 1
at a time.

19:31.804 --> 19:35.173
First it's your mom,
then it's your wife,

19:35.175 --> 19:36.374
Then it's the daughter

19:36.376 --> 19:38.609
You leave all your money to
when you die.

19:38.611 --> 19:42.513
Point is, anything else
violates the natural order.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.248
Natural order.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.450
You might be
onto something.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.521
Good luck
with that mess.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.722
Help me.

Well,<i> you</i> are not getting
so much as a nibble

20:02.702 --> 20:04.268
Until you admit

20:04.270 --> 20:08.639
I have medically diagnosed
chronic bronchitis.

20:08.641 --> 20:12.276
Mom, you raised me
to be strong.

20:12.278 --> 20:15.846
You gave me the tools to survive
and succeed in a hard world,

20:15.848 --> 20:18.416
And I wouldn't be
half the man I am today

20:18.418 --> 20:20.851
Without the wisdom
you instilled in me.

20:20.853 --> 20:23.521
Now, there's my andre.

20:23.523 --> 20:24.722
Aww. [ chuckles ]

20:24.724 --> 20:28.593
That wisdom is telling me
to tell you right now

To back off
when it comes to bow.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.830
You mean
the spot stealer?

First of all,
it's<i> my</i> spot, all right?

20:35.902 --> 20:38.869
And bow is my wife
of 16 years.

20:38.871 --> 20:40.972
You will always be
my mother,

Tonight, we're gonna eat your
mother's little red pebbles.

It's quinoa.
