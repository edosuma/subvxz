WEBVTT

00:02.812 --> 00:04.546
We got a new batch of holiday cards.

00:05.890 --> 00:08.191
Ugh, Christmas cards in this town

00:08.253 --> 00:10.353
are so over-the-top.

00:10.421 --> 00:12.388
Sweet Lord.

00:12.457 --> 00:14.890
This folds out
into a full nativity scene.

00:14.959 --> 00:16.158
Is that camel hair?

00:16.227 --> 00:17.193
Ooh, I'm saving this one.

00:17.262 --> 00:18.461
This is just another opportunity

00:18.529 --> 00:19.862
for people to show off.

00:19.931 --> 00:21.697
Look at these pictures!

00:21.766 --> 00:23.566
New house, new boobs,

00:23.635 --> 00:25.334
old nanny who's now the new wife.

00:25.403 --> 00:26.769
Who are they trying to impress
with these things?

00:26.838 --> 00:27.770
Me!

00:27.839 --> 00:29.750
Check out this cardstock. Is this linen?

00:29.836 --> 00:31.107
- It's linen, Katie.
- Mm-hmm.

00:31.175 --> 00:32.741
This is softer than our sheets.

00:32.810 --> 00:35.811
Well, I did buy our sheets
from the grocery store, so...

00:35.880 --> 00:38.124
Look, the Harpers went to Australia
and got to pet a whale.

00:38.189 --> 00:39.521
Mnh-mnh.

00:40.351 --> 00:42.251
Why are you so mad at the whale?

00:42.320 --> 00:44.220
Sea mammals have nothing to do
with Christmas.

00:44.289 --> 00:48.090
That card is just a way of telling us
that they went on an expensive vacation.

00:48.159 --> 00:49.236
And I already know that

00:49.261 --> 00:51.527
because I hate-follow
Shelly Harper's Instagram.

00:51.596 --> 00:53.329
Why do you let things like this
bother you so much?

00:53.398 --> 00:54.697
Because I don't want our kids thinking

00:54.766 --> 00:56.861
that this shallowness
is what Christmas is about.

00:57.001 --> 01:00.069
Christmas is about being cozy
and eating cookies from a tin,

01:00.138 --> 01:02.171
and then the kids arguing
over who gets the tin,

01:02.240 --> 01:04.473
and then me yelling, "All right!
Nobody gets the tin!"

01:04.542 --> 01:06.609
That's what Christmas is about.

01:07.912 --> 01:09.412
Add in a touch of Baby Jesus.

01:09.480 --> 01:11.514
Greg, your phone.

01:11.583 --> 01:13.783
Yeah, I was just checking to
make sure that it's working.

01:13.851 --> 01:15.818
Waiting to hear
if I got that speaking gig.

01:15.887 --> 01:17.687
I could use the money for a new laptop.

01:17.755 --> 01:19.655
The old one heats up
like a panini press.

01:19.724 --> 01:21.390
Burned the hairs straight off my thighs.

01:21.459 --> 01:23.659
Work better pick you
over that jerk Kidney Disease Carl.

01:23.728 --> 01:25.361
I know my department has a lot of Carls,

01:25.430 --> 01:27.427
but you need to come up
with a nicer nickname.

01:27.451 --> 01:29.832
Merry Christmas, Ottos!

01:29.901 --> 01:31.467
- Oh, hey, Viv.
- Santa Viv!

01:31.536 --> 01:32.501
- Hi!
- Ohh.

01:32.570 --> 01:34.036
You just let yourself in now.

01:34.105 --> 01:35.004
Oh, you.

01:35.073 --> 01:36.038
That's not an answer.

01:36.107 --> 01:37.006
Ah.

01:37.075 --> 01:38.374
No, no, no, no, no!

01:38.443 --> 01:40.876
These quinoa muffins
are for Greg and the kids.

01:40.945 --> 01:43.911
I got you something even better...

01:43.948 --> 01:46.582
- The gift of potential.
- Oh.

01:48.920 --> 01:50.720
- A Fitbit.
- Right!

01:50.788 --> 01:52.288
That's a fresh, new way
of calling me fat.

01:52.357 --> 01:54.890
You're not fat, Katie.
You're on your way to thin.

01:54.959 --> 01:57.193
These muffins are pointy...

01:57.262 --> 02:00.196
which is a fun surprise.

02:00.265 --> 02:01.464
Oh, good.

02:01.532 --> 02:03.199
Hey, guys, so I'm guessing

02:03.268 --> 02:05.968
your Christmas-lighting designer
is non-existent.

02:06.037 --> 02:07.870
And since I have to look
at your house every day,

02:07.939 --> 02:09.972
I can just send over my guys,
Scott and Scott.

02:10.041 --> 02:11.240
The Two Scotts.

02:11.309 --> 02:12.575
Mnh-mnh. We're good.

02:12.644 --> 02:17.346
Our simple decorations are
perfect just the way they are.

02:17.415 --> 02:18.781
No, they're not.

02:18.850 --> 02:20.082
In other news,

02:20.151 --> 02:22.618
you are looking at the chairwoman

02:22.687 --> 02:23.853
for the school concert tomorrow.

02:23.921 --> 02:25.321
I need help setting up,

02:25.390 --> 02:27.790
so I assume you'll volunteer
your Katie skills.

02:27.859 --> 02:29.392
Actually, my Katie skills are what I use

02:29.460 --> 02:30.860
to get out of volunteering for things.

02:32.096 --> 02:33.562
Oh, Katie.

02:33.631 --> 02:36.732
You know, if you're not careful,

02:36.801 --> 02:39.235
you're gonna wind up on my naughty list.

02:39.304 --> 02:40.436
And watch out.

02:40.505 --> 02:41.604
I spank.

02:41.673 --> 02:42.705
Ho!

02:42.774 --> 02:43.639
Okay.

02:43.708 --> 02:44.373
- Ho, ho!
- Right.

02:45.643 --> 02:46.475
Merry Christmas!

02:46.544 --> 02:47.810
Bye, Viv!

02:50.882 --> 02:53.316
We have got to start locking this door.

02:55.086 --> 02:57.987
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

03:01.359 --> 03:02.858
Why'd you throw that out?

03:02.927 --> 03:04.860
It's a computer that tells me
how little I exercise,

03:04.929 --> 03:05.728
which I already know.

03:05.797 --> 03:07.229
Viv is just like Santa.

03:07.298 --> 03:09.165
She gives gifts, she volunteers,

03:09.233 --> 03:10.933
she even wears the hat.

03:11.002 --> 03:13.002
No, I'm like Santa.

03:13.071 --> 03:14.770
We both have the same body-type,

03:14.839 --> 03:17.273
and we make lists of people
who've pissed us off.

03:17.342 --> 03:18.774
You're more like Krampus.

03:18.843 --> 03:19.942
Who's Krampus?

03:21.179 --> 03:24.280
That's you... Krampus.

03:25.683 --> 03:28.117
I can't believe you think
Mama is a monster.

03:28.186 --> 03:29.985
Krampus isn't a monster, Mama.

03:30.054 --> 03:32.088
He's just a half-goat, half-demon

03:32.156 --> 03:34.390
who punishes children
during the holidays,

03:34.459 --> 03:36.826
and sometimes eats
their hands and butts.

03:36.894 --> 03:37.927
See, it's not so bad.

03:37.995 --> 03:40.529
He's far and away my favorite
of the anti-Santa villains.

03:40.598 --> 03:42.465
- Name two others.
- Von Krispin...

03:42.533 --> 03:45.234
- Oh, Greg.
- Mama, not in front of the Elf.

03:45.303 --> 03:46.569
<i>The Elf on the Mantle.</i>

03:46.637 --> 03:49.205
<i>The little narc who reports
everything we do back to Santa.</i>

03:49.291 --> 03:52.041
<i>And he's always staring at me
like a grade-A perv.</i>

03:52.110 --> 03:54.343
<i>It's half the price
of the one you're thinking of.</i>

03:54.412 --> 03:57.113
I don't want him telling Santa
that you're acting like Krampus.

03:57.181 --> 03:59.615
Then none of us will get any gifts.

03:59.684 --> 04:01.484
I'm pretty sure the rest of us
will still get gifts.

04:01.552 --> 04:03.886
Unh-unh! The Elf is getting all of this,

04:03.955 --> 04:05.955
and he's gonna run it
right up the ladder!

04:06.023 --> 04:08.090
Don't worry. The Elf loves Mama.

04:08.159 --> 04:10.593
I love this little fella.

04:10.661 --> 04:12.928
I'll even turn the light on
so he can watch us

04:12.997 --> 04:14.830
- all night long.
- Okay.

04:14.899 --> 04:18.634
Now I have to go practice for
the holiday concert tomorrow.

04:18.702 --> 04:20.435
But you practiced all morning.

04:20.505 --> 04:23.773
Mr. Brannagan gets mad
if we don't sing right.

04:23.841 --> 04:24.974
Anna-Kat.

04:25.042 --> 04:26.542
I can't make a mistake!

04:26.611 --> 04:28.544
What's wrong with that music teacher?

04:28.613 --> 04:29.945
It's a little kids' school concert.

04:30.014 --> 04:31.814
The whole thing is a mistake!

04:31.883 --> 04:35.217
I bet it's hard for him to get
kids to focus this time of year.

04:35.286 --> 04:36.519
Why do you always do that?

04:36.587 --> 04:38.053
Okay, this seems
like one of those things

04:38.122 --> 04:40.089
where you feel like we've talked
about it a hundred times,

04:40.158 --> 04:41.424
and it's completely new to me.

04:41.492 --> 04:42.792
You never lose your temper.

04:42.860 --> 04:45.027
You are always trying to put
a positive spin on things.

04:45.096 --> 04:46.529
- How do you live with it?
- No, really!

04:46.597 --> 04:48.264
You defended those
obnoxious Christmas cards,

04:48.332 --> 04:49.532
you defended your co-worker,

04:49.600 --> 04:51.133
even Anna-Kat's horrible music teacher.

04:51.202 --> 04:52.435
Also in there, I defended you.

04:52.503 --> 04:54.003
Don't cloud my anger with love.

04:54.071 --> 04:55.371
Stop acting like nothing bothers you,

04:55.440 --> 04:57.306
when I know it does.

04:57.375 --> 04:58.874
Things bother me.

04:58.943 --> 05:01.143
The ending of the space program.

05:01.212 --> 05:02.011
That's pretty much it.

05:02.079 --> 05:03.779
If we can't hate together,

05:03.848 --> 05:06.182
then I end up looking like a
fire-breathing Christmas dragon.

05:06.250 --> 05:07.683
Again, Krampus is half-goat, half-demon.

05:07.752 --> 05:09.118
Dragons are a whole-different milieu.

05:11.823 --> 05:14.356
We bumped into some gifts
on the top shelf of your closet

05:14.425 --> 05:16.025
that we can only assume are ours.

05:16.093 --> 05:18.327
Books, pajamas. Really, Mom?

05:18.396 --> 05:19.862
If you had confusion
about our wish lists,

05:19.931 --> 05:21.063
you could have come to us.

05:21.132 --> 05:22.665
We try to make ourselves available

05:22.733 --> 05:23.833
for these types of things.

05:23.901 --> 05:24.834
Greg!

05:24.902 --> 05:26.035
What's a positive spin

05:26.103 --> 05:27.970
on your kids acting like
entitled Westport...

05:28.039 --> 05:28.838
Language!

05:28.906 --> 05:29.939
...apple holes?

05:30.007 --> 05:31.874
Okay, obviously,

05:31.943 --> 05:33.876
you guys are completely out of line.

05:33.945 --> 05:37.546
But this is a good opportunity
for a Christmas lesson.

05:37.615 --> 05:38.948
Right!

05:39.016 --> 05:41.050
Now I'm Krampus Katie and
you're jolly, old Saint Greg!

05:41.118 --> 05:42.451
Honey, the Elf on the Mantle.

05:42.520 --> 05:44.487
I don't care about the Elf!
It doesn't have feet!

05:44.555 --> 05:46.322
Doesn't that freak anyone else out?

05:46.390 --> 05:47.756
No, Mom, seriously, the Elf.

05:47.825 --> 05:49.325
Oh!

05:54.532 --> 05:55.498
Agh!

05:55.566 --> 05:56.332
Augh!

05:56.400 --> 05:57.266
Aah!

05:57.335 --> 06:00.169
Okay.

06:00.238 --> 06:03.005
Whew! Crisis averted!

06:03.074 --> 06:04.740
You murdered our Elf.

06:09.080 --> 06:11.313
Krampus.

06:18.066 --> 06:19.632
I've got a PR problem, Greg.

06:19.701 --> 06:20.934
Anna-Kat muttered "Krampus"

06:21.002 --> 06:23.069
as she passed me in the hallway
this morning.

06:23.138 --> 06:24.871
Am I really that bad?

06:24.940 --> 06:26.506
Well, you say things out loud

06:26.582 --> 06:28.815
that polite society frowns upon...

06:28.877 --> 06:30.310
and impolite society.

06:30.378 --> 06:31.844
Really, all society.

06:31.913 --> 06:34.013
Don't worry about it.
She'll get over it.

06:34.082 --> 06:36.316
Besides, the Christmas Elf's
pretty much back to normal.

06:36.384 --> 06:37.984
Okay, I have to fix this.

06:38.053 --> 06:39.786
I have to figure out
a way to show Anna-Kat

06:39.854 --> 06:41.087
that I have Christmas spirit.

06:41.156 --> 06:43.456
I am not Krampus. I can be nice.

06:43.525 --> 06:45.758
But that means you have
to punish Oliver and Taylor

06:45.827 --> 06:46.826
for being spoiled jerks.

06:46.851 --> 06:47.961
Way ahead of you.

06:48.029 --> 06:49.996
I've got a great punishment
lined up for them today.

06:50.065 --> 06:52.098
Good will towards men...
they're gonna hate it.

06:52.267 --> 06:54.300
Their pain brings me Christmas joy!

06:56.871 --> 06:58.771
- Hey!
- Santa Viv is back!

06:58.840 --> 07:00.340
Hey!

07:00.408 --> 07:01.574
I bought you a wreath

07:01.643 --> 07:03.409
just so your house
doesn't look abandoned.

07:03.478 --> 07:05.745
How nice.

07:05.814 --> 07:08.047
We're having a nice time.

07:08.116 --> 07:10.049
And I'm being nice to you.

07:10.118 --> 07:11.284
You know what else would be nice?

07:11.353 --> 07:13.519
If you came down to the school
to help me decorate.

07:13.588 --> 07:15.021
We want things to be perfect

07:15.090 --> 07:16.956
for Anna Banana's big concert tonight.

07:17.025 --> 07:19.158
Mama, you'd be like
Santa's little helper.

07:19.227 --> 07:20.793
Huh. Helping out at the school.

07:20.862 --> 07:22.128
Excuse the pun, but this seems

07:22.197 --> 07:23.863
like a gift-wrapped opportunity
for Christmas cheer.

07:25.734 --> 07:29.168
Would that make you happy,
if Mama made the school festive?

07:29.237 --> 07:30.903
Would that fix things with the Elf?

07:30.972 --> 07:32.038
It would.

07:32.107 --> 07:34.065
- Then that's what we'll do.
- Yay.

07:34.128 --> 07:35.878
<i>They should make a movie about me...</i>

07:35.948 --> 07:37.034
<i>"The Greatest Mother Ever."</i>

07:37.089 --> 07:38.823
<i>And I want to be played
by Jennifer Lawrence.</i>

07:38.886 --> 07:40.446
<i>And I want Greg to be Latin.</i>

07:40.515 --> 07:42.715
Well, then, let's... let's go, okay?

07:42.784 --> 07:44.884
Oh, wait, don't forget your Fitbit.

07:44.953 --> 07:46.819
You don't want to miss a great
opportunity to count steps.

07:46.888 --> 07:49.188
Sure.

07:49.257 --> 07:51.057
My Fitbit.

07:51.126 --> 07:52.492
Where did that go to?

07:54.929 --> 07:56.095
Oh.

07:56.164 --> 07:57.964
Must've fallen in there

07:58.032 --> 08:00.833
when we were fighting over
your pointy muffins.

08:00.902 --> 08:02.235
We're gonna have so much fun!

08:02.303 --> 08:03.503
I know.

08:03.571 --> 08:06.339
I'm finally getting my hands on you.

08:08.076 --> 08:10.943
Elf, Mama's going to decorate with Viv.

08:11.012 --> 08:14.113
I'm telling him what's going on
because his eyes got burned off

08:17.595 --> 08:20.335
This is what Christmas is all about...
bringing joy to others.

08:20.388 --> 08:21.421
And that's your Christmas lesson.

08:21.489 --> 08:22.989
Ugh, it smells sad in here.

08:23.058 --> 08:24.424
That's part of the lesson.

08:24.492 --> 08:26.793
Uh, how about that lady over there?

08:26.861 --> 08:28.094
She looks super depressing.

08:28.163 --> 08:29.762
Go. Go on.

08:29.831 --> 08:31.698
Go.

08:34.169 --> 08:36.369
Brought the kids in, huh?

08:36.438 --> 08:38.504
Some sort of Christmas lesson?

08:38.573 --> 08:39.938
Yeah, that's right. How'd you know?

08:40.008 --> 08:42.275
Oh, we get a lot of that crap
this time of year.

08:45.280 --> 08:46.612
How's my wrapping station?

08:46.681 --> 08:48.848
Ooh!

08:48.936 --> 08:51.484
I reached my 10,000 steps for the day.

08:51.553 --> 08:53.413
Your Fitbit is synched to my phone,

08:53.460 --> 08:55.288
so I can track your step count, too.

08:55.356 --> 08:57.790
Which is currently...

08:57.859 --> 08:59.258
70?

08:59.327 --> 09:02.128
I'm guessing from your tone that
that's not an impressive number.

09:02.197 --> 09:06.799
It's kind of the... wild west
of wrapping.

09:06.868 --> 09:09.602
Kind of the wild west of comments, Viv.

09:10.638 --> 09:11.971
As volunteer chairwoman,

09:12.040 --> 09:14.574
I want this Christmas concert
to be perfect.

09:14.642 --> 09:16.175
You know, when you move
to a place like this,

09:16.244 --> 09:18.077
it's hard to make your mark.

09:18.146 --> 09:19.879
One of the only ways to become popular

09:19.948 --> 09:22.081
is to volunteer for
a high-profile event like this

09:22.150 --> 09:23.783
and make it magical and spectacular,

09:23.852 --> 09:26.752
and then everyone will think
I'm magical and spectacular.

09:26.821 --> 09:28.855
And it all starts with these gifts,

09:28.923 --> 09:30.456
so re-wrap those packages!

09:30.525 --> 09:32.725
I want tight creases and invisible tape!

09:32.794 --> 09:34.560
Tight creases and invisible tape!

09:34.629 --> 09:36.696
I love it! Bye!

09:36.764 --> 09:38.293
<i>Trying to be nice for Anna-Kat</i>

09:38.355 --> 09:40.589
<i>makes me want to go home and
hang myself in the garage...</i>

09:40.839 --> 09:42.635
<i>no, Greg's office.</i>

09:42.704 --> 09:44.004
<i>I want him to find me.</i>

09:44.029 --> 09:46.096
<i>Let's see him put
a positive spin on that.</i>

09:46.608 --> 09:48.474
So, it's between me and Carl
for the job,

09:48.543 --> 09:50.309
and I could really use the extra money.

09:50.378 --> 09:52.478
So you're just gonna sit there
and wait for the phone to ring?

09:52.547 --> 09:54.847
Get down there and pester your boss

09:54.916 --> 09:56.048
till he gives you the job.

09:56.117 --> 09:57.116
That's not really my style.

09:57.185 --> 09:59.018
Look, I learned one thing...

09:59.087 --> 10:00.920
You have to be aggressive in life.

10:00.989 --> 10:02.488
Did you ever see that show "Mad Men"?

10:02.557 --> 10:03.656
Oh, are you in advertising?

10:03.725 --> 10:05.458
No, no, no.
I-I was an extra on the show.

10:05.527 --> 10:08.961
And I always pushed up front
so the camera could see me.

10:09.030 --> 10:10.530
Mm, ruined a lot of shots,

10:10.598 --> 10:12.565
but you got to take what's yours.

10:12.634 --> 10:14.400
That's all I'm saying.

10:14.469 --> 10:16.569
No, I get your point.

10:16.638 --> 10:18.471
But the best restaurants are in Paris.

10:18.540 --> 10:19.605
Have you been to Paris?

10:19.674 --> 10:20.773
Me neither.

10:20.842 --> 10:22.108
But it's just like Brussels.

10:22.176 --> 10:23.109
Have you been to Brussels?

10:23.177 --> 10:25.278
Me neither, but...

10:25.346 --> 10:28.481
Listen, this has been a real
roller coaster of a conversation,

10:28.550 --> 10:29.916
but we've got a thing, so...

10:29.984 --> 10:31.384
Oh, of course.

10:31.452 --> 10:32.919
Well, thank you for coming.

10:32.987 --> 10:36.255
I can't believe my two favorite
grandchildren came all this way.

10:36.324 --> 10:37.590
- Oh, no, we're...
- Hold.

10:37.659 --> 10:38.758
Let's see how this plays out.

10:38.826 --> 10:41.694
Here's $100 for you two.

10:41.763 --> 10:43.863
Get yourselves something for Christmas.

10:46.167 --> 10:47.800
- We love you, Grandma!
- Thank you, Grandma!

10:52.707 --> 10:54.574
Oh! Good.

10:54.642 --> 10:56.909
Put that in the VIP section,
close to the stage.

10:56.978 --> 10:59.249
Wait. There's a VIP section?

10:59.335 --> 11:00.613
For a children's Christmas concert?

11:00.682 --> 11:03.015
Yeah, they donate a little money
so they don't have to wait in line

11:03.084 --> 11:04.884
and can get the best video
of their kiddies.

11:04.953 --> 11:06.819
I'm lying. It's a lot of money.

11:06.888 --> 11:08.588
Doesn't that bother anyone?

11:08.656 --> 11:09.822
Doesn't seem to!

11:11.526 --> 11:14.393
None of these people are ever
bothered by anything.

11:14.462 --> 11:15.995
<i>Huh.</i>

11:16.064 --> 11:18.598
<i>Could their fake happiness
actually be real happiness?</i>

11:18.666 --> 11:20.099
<i>Am I missing something?</i>

11:20.168 --> 11:22.720
<i>Could they have the secret to life?</i>

11:22.745 --> 11:25.471
<i>I feel like Carrie Bradshaw right now.</i>

11:25.540 --> 11:27.707
<i>Meanwhile, across town
at the retirement home,</i>

11:27.775 --> 11:30.309
<i>Greg was experiencing
some fake happiness of his own.</i>

11:32.880 --> 11:36.315
Okay, Grammy, it's time for us to go.

11:36.384 --> 11:38.818
Well, thank you for visiting.

11:38.886 --> 11:40.886
Goodbye, Brad.

11:40.955 --> 11:43.189
Bye, Bethany.

11:43.257 --> 11:45.124
This has been the best Christmas gift

11:45.193 --> 11:46.359
I could have imagined.

11:46.427 --> 11:47.994
Yep! Come on... Brad.

11:48.062 --> 11:50.529
Got to run!

11:50.598 --> 11:51.597
Ooh, ooh, ooh, what's the rush?

11:51.666 --> 11:52.698
I'd love to meet your new friend.

11:52.767 --> 11:54.033
What? No.

11:54.102 --> 11:55.735
We already said goodbye.

11:55.803 --> 11:57.203
Is that the Christmas lesson...

11:57.271 --> 11:58.771
to thumb our noses at social norms?

11:58.840 --> 11:59.839
Let's go!

11:59.907 --> 12:01.173
We learned plenty today.

12:01.242 --> 12:02.642
All right.

12:02.710 --> 12:06.979
Merry Christmas, kids!
Grandma loves you!

12:07.048 --> 12:09.248
Grandma?

12:09.317 --> 12:12.084
Don't spend all that money in one place!

12:13.054 --> 12:15.287
You took money from her?

12:15.356 --> 12:17.923
Is it our fault she thought we were
her grandkids and gave us money?

12:17.992 --> 12:19.225
Yes!

12:19.293 --> 12:21.727
I brought you here to learn a lesson,
and you conned an old lady?

12:21.796 --> 12:23.496
No way. You're giving the money back.

12:25.166 --> 12:26.632
Do you really want her to find out

12:26.701 --> 12:30.002
that her real grandkids didn't
visit her for Christmas?

12:30.071 --> 12:32.138
Is that the Christmas lesson...

12:32.206 --> 12:34.006
to break an elderly woman's heart?

12:34.075 --> 12:36.008
Great. I'll go give her her money back

12:36.077 --> 12:38.444
and tell her she spelled "home"
wrong on her needlepoint.

12:38.513 --> 12:39.612
That is not the lesson.

12:39.681 --> 12:41.280
But a lesson will come...

12:42.550 --> 12:44.250
...right after I get this job.

12:44.318 --> 12:45.785
Hello? Professor Otto.

12:47.655 --> 12:49.622
No, I'm completely satisfied
with my cable service.

12:50.958 --> 12:52.925
Actually, it's pretty expensive.

12:52.994 --> 12:53.793
Come on. Let's go.

12:56.597 --> 12:57.863
See?

12:57.932 --> 12:59.865
This is what I'm talking about.

12:59.934 --> 13:01.534
They're having the time of their lives,

13:01.602 --> 13:02.835
not questioning a thing.

13:02.904 --> 13:05.971
That woman is wearing
antlers made for a cat,

13:06.040 --> 13:07.707
and she's happier
than I was at my wedding.

13:07.775 --> 13:10.409
They do seem genuinely happy.

13:10.478 --> 13:11.711
It's creepy.

13:11.779 --> 13:14.447
Why can't I just relax
and let things go?

13:14.515 --> 13:15.681
Because it's against your nature.

13:15.750 --> 13:16.882
Like me and monogamy.

13:16.951 --> 13:18.651
It's not natural.

13:18.720 --> 13:19.485
Okay.

13:19.554 --> 13:20.753
Maybe I can pull it off.

13:20.822 --> 13:22.888
I've been acting happy
for Anna-Kat all day.

13:22.957 --> 13:24.323
It's gone pretty well.

13:24.392 --> 13:26.692
What if I just commit to it full-time?

13:26.761 --> 13:28.527
Cheerful Katie.

13:28.596 --> 13:30.396
Positive Katie.

13:30.465 --> 13:31.497
Here come Viv.

13:31.566 --> 13:33.733
Hey! It's my girls!

13:33.801 --> 13:34.867
Hi!

13:34.936 --> 13:36.869
I found this little scamp running around

13:36.938 --> 13:38.637
putting extra steps on your Fitbit.

13:38.706 --> 13:40.005
That's weird.

13:40.074 --> 13:42.475
I certainly didn't pay her to do that.

13:42.543 --> 13:45.377
We have so many good things
to catch the Elf up on.

13:45.446 --> 13:48.781
So, Viv, is there anything else
that I can do

13:48.850 --> 13:51.684
to be helpful and nice?

13:51.753 --> 13:53.352
Well, you know, you could
drop off some gifts

13:53.421 --> 13:54.820
I bought for a family in need.

13:54.889 --> 13:56.388
It would really lift their spirits.

13:56.457 --> 13:57.957
Absolutely.

13:58.025 --> 13:59.850
I'll call Daddy to come pick us up.

13:59.929 --> 14:02.061
You can wear my Santa hat!

14:02.130 --> 14:03.429
- Hmm.
- Ah!

14:03.498 --> 14:05.664
Oh, good.

14:05.733 --> 14:07.466
It's still warm.

14:09.737 --> 14:12.260
All right. Bringing gifts to the poor.

14:12.322 --> 14:13.739
Doesn't get more Christmasy than that.

14:13.808 --> 14:15.541
You kids are finally gonna
learn something.

14:15.610 --> 14:16.942
What about their lesson
at the retirement home?

14:17.011 --> 14:18.444
That one got away from me.

14:18.513 --> 14:19.979
Did work call yet?

14:20.047 --> 14:22.014
Nothing yet, but staying positive.

14:22.083 --> 14:23.349
You should.

14:23.417 --> 14:25.284
I'm sure it's going to work out.

14:25.353 --> 14:27.153
Super sure.

14:27.221 --> 14:28.621
I love the new Christmas Katie.

14:28.689 --> 14:30.256
Mm-hmm. Oh!

14:30.324 --> 14:32.158
Here's number 17. Turn here.

14:32.226 --> 14:33.392
All right, kids.

14:33.461 --> 14:36.380
Get ready to see
what real need looks like.

14:38.000 --> 14:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:45.239 --> 14:49.809
Wait, are we all aware of what
the word "need" means?

14:56.784 --> 14:58.300
There must be some confusion.

14:58.325 --> 15:00.218
We're looking for a poor-type family.

15:00.287 --> 15:01.419
Do you have a maid,

15:01.488 --> 15:03.354
or perhaps a vagrant
that's passing through?

15:03.423 --> 15:05.056
No, I'm afraid that's us.

15:05.125 --> 15:07.258
It was so nice of Viv to help us out

15:07.327 --> 15:08.827
in this difficult time.

15:08.895 --> 15:11.262
Oh, yeah. Viv is the best.

15:11.331 --> 15:12.263
Yeah.

15:12.332 --> 15:13.264
Shrimp cocktail?

15:13.333 --> 15:14.432
- No, thank you.
- See, Mom?

15:14.501 --> 15:16.267
It comes other ways besides popcorned.

15:16.336 --> 15:17.135
Hmm.

15:17.204 --> 15:18.603
Oh, Oliver.

15:18.672 --> 15:20.071
You little rascal.

15:21.208 --> 15:22.941
Apologies for the decorations.

15:23.009 --> 15:25.009
We can only afford one Scott this year.

15:25.078 --> 15:26.211
Yes.

15:26.279 --> 15:28.079
You see, our assets
in the Caymans got frozen.

15:28.148 --> 15:29.747
It's been a real bear.

15:29.816 --> 15:31.282
We can't afford a vacation.

15:31.351 --> 15:34.419
We're just going to... Hawaii.

15:34.488 --> 15:36.588
Mama, is it time for the presents?

15:36.656 --> 15:38.957
Sure. Time for presents!

15:39.025 --> 15:40.372
Presents for the rich people.

15:40.397 --> 15:42.260
Oh, uh, wow.

15:42.329 --> 15:43.361
Oh!

15:43.430 --> 15:44.362
- Thank you.
- Wow.

15:44.431 --> 15:46.164
Thank you. Wonderful.

15:46.233 --> 15:48.533
Well, I learned
an important Christmas lesson.

15:48.602 --> 15:49.968
No matter how rich you are,

15:50.036 --> 15:51.903
expensive gifts still make a difference.

15:51.972 --> 15:54.873
Wow, I felt that,
but I didn't know how to say it.

15:54.941 --> 15:56.241
Not the lesson.

15:56.309 --> 16:00.278
Oh, and guys, Viv wanted me
to give you one last thing...

16:00.347 --> 16:02.113
the gift of potential.

16:02.182 --> 16:04.849
Pre-loaded with 118 free steps.

16:04.918 --> 16:06.251
Merry Christmas, rich people!

16:10.323 --> 16:11.723
Oh! Ottos!

16:11.791 --> 16:13.791
I saved you seats! Merry Christmas.

16:14.895 --> 16:16.895
How does it look?

16:16.963 --> 16:18.596
Is it magical? Are you transported?

16:18.665 --> 16:20.498
Is there too much cinnamon in the air?

16:20.567 --> 16:23.067
Viv, you got to cut those pills in half.

16:23.136 --> 16:24.536
There's too much cinnamon in the air.

16:24.604 --> 16:26.604
So stupid, Viv.

16:28.875 --> 16:30.608
Here it is.

16:30.677 --> 16:32.610
Go get 'em, honey.

16:32.679 --> 16:34.179
Hello?

16:34.247 --> 16:36.447
Oh, hi.

16:36.516 --> 16:38.683
Oh.

16:38.752 --> 16:40.218
Oh.

16:40.287 --> 16:42.453
Yeah, no, of course. I understand.

16:42.522 --> 16:44.856
Yes, uh, happy holidays.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.092
They gave it to Carl.

16:48.161 --> 16:49.594
That jerk!

16:49.663 --> 16:51.663
There's no way
I'm changing his nickname now.

16:51.731 --> 16:53.831
Oh, hon, I'm so sorry. It'll...

16:53.900 --> 16:55.099
It's fine. I'm fine.

16:55.168 --> 16:56.601
I'm so lucky.

16:56.670 --> 16:58.403
Think of poor Carl,
always needing a kidney.

16:58.471 --> 17:00.572
I don't need a kidney.

I'm sorry this is where your
music career has spit you out,

18:23.690 --> 18:25.423

18:25.492 --> 18:27.191
So turn around, shut up,

18:27.260 --> 18:30.295
and let our adorable children
mangle these Christmas classics!

18:41.074 --> 18:43.141
That was amazing.

18:43.209 --> 18:44.542
That felt amazing.

18:44.611 --> 18:45.576

- Pretty much.

18:47.914 --> 18:50.048
Nothing better than just
letting your anger out.

the Christmas lesson...

None of you have accepted
my friend request!
