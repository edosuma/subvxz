00:03.136 --> 00:04.728
WiII, give me aII your money.

00:04.804 --> 00:08.069
I'm sorry, CarIton.
I don't feeI Iike pIaying 7-EIeven.

00:08.908 --> 00:10.375
This isn't a game, WiII.

00:10.443 --> 00:12.570
I know you have $50, and I need it.

00:12.712 --> 00:14.077
Forget it, man.

00:14.214 --> 00:17.206
$50? I couId take
 25 women out to dinner.

00:19.119 --> 00:21.019
Look, Iisten carefuIIy, WiII.

00:21.087 --> 00:23.555
And I know you can hear me
with ears that big.

00:24.224 --> 00:27.352
Biff's dad is a bankruptcy Iawyer
and according to him...

00:27.460 --> 00:30.918
WestworId AirIines is about to faII prey
to a corporate raider.

00:31.264 --> 00:32.287
Word?

00:32.665 --> 00:34.690
Man, I don't beIieve that.
A corporate raider?

00:34.768 --> 00:37.259
What the bIoody heII
are you taIking about?

00:37.370 --> 00:40.965
It's caIIed inside information,
and it's quite iIIegaI.

00:41.141 --> 00:43.234
So is that French nanny you're dating.

00:44.744 --> 00:45.870
Enough said.

00:47.380 --> 00:50.781
The point is I've onIy got $50,
and I need $100 to buy the stock.

00:51.584 --> 00:54.849
AII right, just Iet me think about it
for a IittIe whiIe, aII right?

00:54.954 --> 00:55.978
No.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.291
WiII, take my hand...

01:00.560 --> 01:02.187
come out of the ghetto...

01:04.397 --> 01:06.490
and take a stroII down WaII Street.

01:06.766 --> 01:07.755
You see...

01:07.901 --> 01:12.463
we buy stock in WestworId AirIines
 today for $2 a share.

01:12.672 --> 01:15.470
And by Friday, it's worth $8.

01:16.076 --> 01:20.137
Now, when you take a girI out to dinner,
they can get something to eat, too.

01:26.019 --> 01:28.783
So then they'II owe me something!
I'm with you!

01:31.191 --> 01:32.818
Here's my $20.

01:33.193 --> 01:35.787
-I thought you said it was iIIegaI.
-It is.

01:36.062 --> 01:38.121
God, how I Iove Iife on the edge.

01:40.433 --> 01:41.832
-Hi, guys.
-Hey, Aunt Viv.

01:41.901 --> 01:44.529
CarIton, honey, wouId you drop
my braceIet off at the jeweIer's?

01:44.604 --> 01:45.935
-The cIasp broke.
-Sure.

01:47.307 --> 01:50.435
-Those aImost Iook Iike reaI diamonds.
-They are, so be carefuI.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.765
HeIIo there, Agnes.

03:21.401 --> 03:23.460
My, that's a IoveIy tattoo.

03:24.137 --> 03:27.800
You know, the knife dripping bIood
reaIIy sets off your eyes.

03:29.242 --> 03:31.540
I did it myseIf. So what you got?

03:32.412 --> 03:35.142
We have this IoveIy, expensive braceIet.

03:35.515 --> 03:36.880
$200.

03:37.183 --> 03:38.673
For an ordinary braceIet...

03:38.751 --> 03:42.312
but not okay for one that formerIy
beIonged to Catherine the Great.

03:42.455 --> 03:45.618
The one-armed chick that works
the corner of HoIIywood and Vine?

03:47.694 --> 03:50.060
She a cIass act. Okay, $300.

03:50.430 --> 03:52.625
Did we mention that
 it ain't stoIen?

03:53.499 --> 03:55.330
Okay, $400.

03:55.468 --> 03:58.926
But that's onIy 'cause I think
your short friend here is kind of cute.

03:59.005 --> 04:00.336
Hey, smaII stuff...

04:00.406 --> 04:04.035
you wanna come back here and check out
the rest of my merchandise?

04:09.983 --> 04:13.009
This is a deIicious meaI, Geoffrey.
You've outdone yourseIf.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.917
You're too kind, sir.

04:15.421 --> 04:17.411
Moron! Fathead!

04:24.130 --> 04:27.395
Geoffrey, must you Iisten
to the Dodgers game during dinner?

04:29.402 --> 04:31.393
I'm terribIy sorry, madam.

04:31.471 --> 04:34.770
But it is the bottom of the ninth,
bases are Ioaded.

04:35.008 --> 04:38.500
However,
I wiII maintain my professionaIism.

04:39.312 --> 04:41.803
Bunt, you pasty-faced sod!

04:45.051 --> 04:46.040
Peas?

04:48.921 --> 04:52.516
Mom, have I toId you that every year
you grow even more youthfuI?

04:54.294 --> 04:57.730
You're going to be weII into your 40s
before you need pIastic surgery.

04:59.565 --> 05:02.227
No, you cannot have the Diamond League
over for Iunch.

05:02.302 --> 05:05.294
Daddy, you promised you wouId
 reason with her.

05:05.405 --> 05:08.568
Honey, I don't know why you want
to join that organization anyway.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.404
Baby, it was different when I joined.

05:10.476 --> 05:13.570
Today, aII those women care about
are cars, men, and money.

05:13.646 --> 05:16.046
WeII, what's wrong 
with that, sweetheart?

05:16.115 --> 05:18.845
Men with money can drive her away
in their cars.

05:22.055 --> 05:24.489
Come on, it's just a IittIe Iunch.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.923
You never got me a pony.

05:29.862 --> 05:31.727
Geoffrey, start buffing the siIver.

05:31.798 --> 05:35.564
What the heII's your probIem?
You got bricks in your butt, you cIown?

05:38.338 --> 05:39.999
Right away, madam.

05:44.811 --> 05:48.645
<i>Today's big story is the rumor</i>
<i>of Westworld Air's imminent takeover...</i>

05:48.715 --> 05:51.115

05:51.951 --> 05:53.976
Your miIk, Master CarIton.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.677
Thank you, Geoffrey.

05:56.322 --> 05:58.222
How's our stock doing?

05:58.324 --> 05:59.689
Up 300%.

06:01.494 --> 06:03.553
And might I add....

06:09.802 --> 06:12.532
Hey, man, you know what I'm gonna do
with my share of the money?

06:12.605 --> 06:14.835
I'm gonna go out
and get my very own team.

06:14.907 --> 06:17.569
It's between the Raiderettes
and the Laker GirIs.

06:18.444 --> 06:20.139
You can't buy Iove, WiII.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.078
Man, what you taIking about?
I don't want Iove.

06:22.148 --> 06:24.810
I just want them to foIIow me around
saying, "Go, WiII. Get busy.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.476
"Put your thing down."

06:27.553 --> 06:29.111
<i>Here's a Wall Street update.</i>

06:29.188 --> 06:33.522
<i>The SEC has suspended trading of</i>
<i>Westworld Air pending an announcement.</i>

06:33.793 --> 06:35.283
Come on, CarIton, transIate.

06:35.361 --> 06:37.989
How can I put this
in terms he'II understand?

06:39.065 --> 06:41.499
More money.

06:45.938 --> 06:50.500
Man, I'm gonna get me
the best girIfriend money can buy.

06:51.711 --> 06:54.077
Come on, man,
you gotta think investment.

06:54.147 --> 06:56.547
See, I'm gonna go out
and get me a Burger King, right?

06:56.616 --> 06:59.278
And then I'm gonna hire
some topIess counter girIs...

06:59.385 --> 07:01.546
and then I'm gonna 
reaIIy have it my way.

07:04.757 --> 07:08.989
<i>This just in.: Westworld Airlines</i>

07:39.358 --> 07:40.347
CarIton?

07:42.228 --> 07:43.320
Yes, WiII?

07:45.465 --> 07:47.399
That ain't a good thing, is it?

07:48.468 --> 07:49.730
No, WiII.

07:51.437 --> 07:54.031
-We're in troubIe, ain't we?
-Yes, WiII.

07:56.442 --> 07:58.433
We just Iost everything.

07:59.812 --> 08:03.077
Oh, my God! How're we gonna get
Mom's braceIet back?

08:03.616 --> 08:07.177
-Come on, man. Don't panic.
-Too Iate. Dad knows.

08:07.520 --> 08:11.012
No Harvard. Dead end.
 "Paper or pIastic?"

08:13.893 --> 08:15.793
Look, come on, just reIax.

08:16.596 --> 08:18.996
We'II just go get weII-paying jobs...

08:19.065 --> 08:20.999
very weII-paying jobs.

08:23.636 --> 08:25.263
$24, $25.

08:25.705 --> 08:29.266
Gosh. Who'd have thought they'd pay you
so IittIe for seIIing your bIood?

08:32.278 --> 08:34.803
-How do you feeI, WiII?
-I'm fine.

08:44.222 --> 08:45.281
Buck up.

08:45.424 --> 08:49.087
You onIy have to give bIood 50 more times
to get Mom's braceIet back.

08:49.996 --> 08:52.191
There's gotta be an easier way, man.

08:53.165 --> 08:55.133
If I couId just get them cIassifieds.

08:57.169 --> 08:59.694
You're not gonna hit me with this,
are you?

09:00.540 --> 09:01.666
I'd Iike to.

09:01.774 --> 09:04.538
But I see three of you,
and I don't know which one to hit.

09:06.245 --> 09:08.736
Face it, WiII.
You're not gonna find a job in there.

09:08.814 --> 09:11.578
What are you quaIified to do
besides fIirt with women...

09:11.651 --> 09:13.516
and dance to Ioud, primitive music?

09:15.454 --> 09:17.922
"MaIe strippers wanted." Bingo.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.522
WiII, teII me you're joking.

09:21.661 --> 09:24.357
Even you, with your depraved,
working-cIass moraIity...

09:24.430 --> 09:26.159
wouIdn't stoop so Iow.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.825
"Earn up to $500 a night."

09:33.039 --> 09:34.472
Shake that groove thing.

09:44.050 --> 09:46.177
So, did you get
 the stripper job or not?

09:46.452 --> 09:48.317
Does David Duke shop white saIes?

09:53.759 --> 09:57.320
They said I was a naturaI, man.
They're gonna caII me with my first gig.

09:57.396 --> 09:58.863
HoId up, WiII.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.059
Granted, we're desperate for money...

10:02.168 --> 10:06.161
but maybe you shouId stop and think
of what kind of Iife you'd be Ieading.

10:08.808 --> 10:10.400
Yeah, you're right, C.

10:12.144 --> 10:14.874
Dancing around in some cheap cIub...

10:15.448 --> 10:17.939
whiIe women put doIIars
down my underpants.

10:19.785 --> 10:21.150
I Iove this country.

10:24.357 --> 10:27.121
My financiaI advisors have arrived.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.087
Moron! Fathead!

10:30.663 --> 10:34.724
-I didn't know the Dodgers were pIaying.
-They're not, thieving wankers.

10:36.936 --> 10:38.767
So, I think I shouId ask
for my money back.

10:38.838 --> 10:40.806
I mean, I've been
in this weight-Ioss program...

10:40.873 --> 10:42.500
six whoIe months and Iook at me.

10:42.575 --> 10:43.564
I'm Shamu.

10:47.513 --> 10:50.607
PhiIip, I thought you had
an important business Iunch.

10:50.683 --> 10:53.743
Nothing is more important
than our IittIe bacheIorette.

10:54.086 --> 10:56.486
Mrs. DeWynter! So nice to see you again.

10:56.555 --> 10:57.749
Thank you.

10:57.823 --> 11:00.314
So, what do you think
 of our IittIe HiIary?

11:00.426 --> 11:04.362
She's going to make some man
a wonderfuI wife one day. Soon, I hope.

11:05.865 --> 11:10.097
WeII, I think I speak for aII of us Ieaguers
when I say, "Isn't she IoveIy?"

11:10.169 --> 11:11.158
Yes.

11:15.307 --> 11:18.435
Vivian, I do hope you wiII bring HiIary
to our new members' dinner.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.741
-I'm sorry--
-WeII, I think I can speak for Vivian...

11:20.813 --> 11:22.280
-when I say, "She'II be there."
-PhiIip--

11:22.348 --> 11:23.975
In her brand new BMW.

11:25.117 --> 11:26.106
See you there.

11:30.823 --> 11:33.758
AshIey, sweetie, we are going
to the Diamond League dinner...

11:33.826 --> 11:35.157

11:35.227 --> 11:38.287
Here's the address and phone number
in case there's an emergency. Okay?

11:38.364 --> 11:41.527
Mom, I'm 13 years oId.
I can take care of myseIf.

11:41.901 --> 11:43.664
That's what Drew Barrymore said.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.304
Banks residence.

11:55.214 --> 11:57.944
No, Master WiIIiam's not home,
thank God.

11:59.652 --> 12:01.483
May I take a message?

12:03.355 --> 12:04.344
Yes.

12:05.291 --> 12:06.280
Yes.

12:08.494 --> 12:12.055
Yes, I'II see that he gets it.

12:12.665 --> 12:13.654
Bye.

12:15.935 --> 12:17.766

12:26.412 --> 12:28.175
Bad! My first gig. Hey, where is it?

12:28.247 --> 12:30.715
-The address is on the counter.
-AII right.

12:30.783 --> 12:35.015
And they aIso requested
that you bring a spare...

12:35.087 --> 12:36.349
G-string.

12:38.357 --> 12:40.291
There's an expIanation for that, G.

12:46.932 --> 12:49.298
Yo, CarIton, I got a gig, man.
We're home free.

12:49.368 --> 12:52.531
We'II get Aunt Viv's braceIet out of hock.
She'II never know the difference.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.402
-You mean we're saved?
-You got it.

12:54.473 --> 12:56.600
Hey, I picked my costume up today.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.370
See, I figure I'II start out in this.

13:01.480 --> 13:04.313
And I figure I'II end up in this.

13:07.286 --> 13:09.686
I gotta go iron this stuff.
Get the address for me.

13:09.755 --> 13:11.484
It's right over there
 on the counter.

13:15.161 --> 13:16.890
Gingham TurtIe restaurant.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.163
Sounds pretty sIeazy.

13:32.411 --> 13:34.777
Yo, this ain't exactIy 
what I expected.

13:39.418 --> 13:41.010
Check out the IowIife.

13:43.923 --> 13:44.912
Yes?

13:46.625 --> 13:49.150
-Yeah, man, I'm here for the gig.
-You?

13:49.528 --> 13:52.122
You are here to perform for the Iadies?

13:52.364 --> 13:54.594
-That's right.
-Of course you are.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.363
I'm serious, where are the other guys at?
I gotta get changed.

13:57.436 --> 13:58.562
Other guys?

13:59.038 --> 14:01.768
Yeah, when I auditioned
they said I'd be second on the biII.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.968
Between King Thong and Rambro.

14:06.278 --> 14:09.839
I'm sorry, <i>monsieur.</i>
There is no one on the biII but you.

14:14.320 --> 14:17.380
Ladies, I'm toId
 the entertainment has arrived.

14:17.623 --> 14:20.888
It's my pIeasure to introduce
the internationaI star...

14:20.960 --> 14:24.862
Sir Graham Higgins,
doing a medIey of operatic favorites.

14:34.306 --> 14:36.035
Mom, which opera is this?

14:37.443 --> 14:38.432
WiII...

14:39.378 --> 14:41.073
shake something, damn it!

14:52.091 --> 14:54.855
Take it off! Take it aII off!

17:00.285 --> 17:01.445
Take it off!

17:01.954 --> 17:03.387
Put it on!

17:05.590 --> 17:08.458
CarIton Banks,

17:08.827 --> 17:10.021
Mommy.

17:14.299 --> 17:18.702
No dates, no charge cards,
no teIevision, no movies, no phone caIIs...

17:18.871 --> 17:19.963
no food!

17:22.441 --> 17:24.271
Sir, permission to beg, sir.

17:24.510 --> 17:25.499
What?

17:26.412 --> 17:30.007
I'm deepIy, deepIy sorry
about the unfortunate stripping incident.

17:30.682 --> 17:33.674
-I just wanna say it's aII his fauIt.
-What?

17:36.255 --> 17:38.314
Look, come on, UncIe PhiI.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.951
I mean, I'm sure you did something
Iike this when you were a kid.

17:43.162 --> 17:44.254
Maybe not.

17:46.298 --> 17:48.289
I think you two owe HiIary an apoIogy.

17:48.367 --> 17:51.734
Your behavior tonight cost her
an invitation to join the Diamond League...

17:51.804 --> 17:53.066
and meet some nice young men...

17:53.138 --> 17:55.436
and you know
how much that meant to me.

17:59.044 --> 18:00.204
I mean, her.

18:01.346 --> 18:04.474
It's okay, Daddy. The more time I spent
with those women...

18:04.550 --> 18:07.018
the more I reaIized
they're not my kind of peopIe.

18:07.119 --> 18:09.349
I don't want to have anything
to do with them.

18:09.421 --> 18:12.049
Honey, I am so proud of you.

18:14.660 --> 18:16.594
Mrs. DeWynter.

18:18.330 --> 18:21.697
HiIary, darIing.
Why did you run off Iike that?

18:21.834 --> 18:25.065
I wanted to invite you
to join the Diamond League.

18:25.137 --> 18:26.968
I'd Iove to!

18:29.608 --> 18:33.305
Switching entertainment Iike that.
What an outrageous idea.

18:33.779 --> 18:36.009
Say, my mother's turning 90.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.242
Are they avaiIabIe for birthday parties?

18:43.555 --> 18:45.386
-I guess I'II just be--
-Sit.

18:46.158 --> 18:48.251
I'm not through with you two yet.

18:48.360 --> 18:51.955
I wanna know what excuse you have
for puIIing such a stupid stunt.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.224
-We needed the money.
-For what?

18:54.299 --> 18:56.130
And I want the truth.

18:59.037 --> 19:01.028
AII right, it's Iike this,
 UncIe PhiI.

19:01.106 --> 19:04.667
See, CarIton got this 
inside tip on a stock.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.210
FederaI offense. Go on.

19:12.251 --> 19:16.688
WeII, then we pawned Aunt Viv's braceIet
to get the money for the stock.

19:16.755 --> 19:18.154
Grand Iarceny. Impressive.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.384
And then we Iost the money...

19:22.461 --> 19:25.123
so we had to strip
to get the braceIet back.

19:25.264 --> 19:27.596
That wouId be indecent exposure.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.657
Is there more?

19:30.269 --> 19:31.998
I'm afraid so, Dad.

19:32.905 --> 19:35.965
We never got the cIasp fixed
on Mom's braceIet.

19:38.810 --> 19:40.334
You never got the....

19:50.122 --> 19:51.555
I don't know what to say.

19:51.623 --> 19:53.784
We don't....

19:56.728 --> 19:57.956
What can I do?

20:01.700 --> 20:03.861
What do you boys
 think I shouId do?

20:05.571 --> 20:08.369
I don't know. 
Reward us for our honesty?

20:14.980 --> 20:17.448
-Hey, it worked for the Beave.
-The Beave!

20:19.484 --> 20:21.782
Do I Iook Iike
 a white guy named Ward?

20:25.090 --> 20:26.921
Now, you get that braceIet back...

20:26.992 --> 20:30.291
and for the next six weeks
I don't want to hear you breathe.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.260
Or I'm caIIing the Feds myseIf.

20:39.104 --> 20:43.063
I guess this probabIy ain't the best time
to teII him we ran over the maiIbox.

20:49.448 --> 20:51.712
Come on, man, what is wrong with you?

20:52.150 --> 20:53.515
It's Agnes.

20:56.455 --> 20:59.390
I can feeI her undressing
 me with her eyes.

21:00.292 --> 21:02.453
I don't think so, man.
 She's not Iaughing.

21:04.863 --> 21:06.524
Come on. Go ahead.

21:07.733 --> 21:09.360
Excuse me, Agnes.

21:10.469 --> 21:12.300
But isn't that our braceIet?

21:12.437 --> 21:13.734
Was your braceIet.

21:13.805 --> 21:17.764
I'm onIy obIigated to hoId it for
 five days. Today is the sixth.

21:18.310 --> 21:20.369
But we have the $500.

21:20.479 --> 21:22.242
WeII, I'II give you $550.

21:22.314 --> 21:24.214
HoId it now, hoId it a sec.

21:24.950 --> 21:28.078
Look, Agnes, couId I speak 
to you for a second, pIease?

21:28.987 --> 21:30.352
CouId I speak to Agnes?

21:33.959 --> 21:37.292
Hey, Iook, Agnes, sIimmie, now,
what's up? How you gonna pIay me?

21:37.429 --> 21:39.488
I thought we had an understanding,
you know?

21:39.564 --> 21:42.294
I mean, we speak the same Ianguage
and aII. What's going on?

21:42.367 --> 21:44.665
Babe, we ain't nothing
 going on but the rent.

21:46.838 --> 21:49.466
-It's Iike that, right?
-Just Iike that.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.734
$550 is what the Iady's offering.

21:52.010 --> 21:55.673
I hope it doesn't interfere
with our reIationship, Sweet 'N Low.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.177
PIease, we'II do anything.

22:02.454 --> 22:04.479
What'II it take to
 change your mind?

22:04.623 --> 22:05.920
What you got?

22:15.367 --> 22:16.391
No.

22:17.035 --> 22:18.229
Work it, honey.

22:23.108 --> 22:26.009
-Hey, it worked for the Beave.
-Worked for the Beave!

22:28.947 --> 22:31.381
Do I Iook Iike 
a white guy named Ward?

22:34.786 --> 22:37.721
Now, I want you two to go down there
and get that braceIet back...

22:37.789 --> 22:40.656
and for the next six weeks
I don't want to hear you breathe.

22:40.726 --> 22:42.990
Or I'm diming you
 out to the Feds myseIf.

22:49.968 --> 22:52.198
<i>Congratulations,</i>
<i>you just made the blooper reel.</i>
