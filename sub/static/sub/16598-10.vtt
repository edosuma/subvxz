00:01.635 --> 00:04.805
Previously on The Exorcist...
TOMAS:
God gives you a job to do.

00:04.838 --> 00:06.540
And when that happens,
you have to

00:06.574 --> 00:09.977
drop everything
and just start walking.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.512
God spoke to me today.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.047
Ah.
He said,
"I want you

00:13.081 --> 00:14.582
to help this family, Tomas."

00:14.615 --> 00:15.616
(speaking Spanish
in old woman's voice)

00:19.620 --> 00:21.989
SIMON:
Vocare Pulvere.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.225
Take me.
(gasping)

00:25.693 --> 00:27.027
ANGELA:
Desperation

00:27.061 --> 00:28.562
with notes of mediocrity.

00:28.596 --> 00:31.532
You're never gonna
be one of us.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.967
(speaking French)

00:39.707 --> 00:41.842
(grunting)

00:41.875 --> 00:42.943
Did you kill Bennett?

00:44.245 --> 00:46.046
Ipse venit.

00:46.080 --> 00:48.048
"He is coming."
You're gonna kill the Pope.

00:48.082 --> 00:49.617
(gasping)
(door opening)

00:49.650 --> 00:51.952
(grunting)

00:51.985 --> 00:53.020
(demonic voice):
Sorry, Mommy.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.722
Show's over.

00:54.755 --> 00:57.858
Time to give the people
what they want.

00:57.891 --> 00:58.959
Casey.

00:58.992 --> 01:01.195
(bones cracking)

01:01.229 --> 01:03.030
Casey, no!

01:03.063 --> 01:04.465
No!

01:04.498 --> 01:07.501
Take me instead.

01:10.338 --> 01:12.140
ANGELA:
I'm not possessed.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.041
This is integration.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.909
She invited me in.

01:15.943 --> 01:17.745
Don't you understand?

01:18.979 --> 01:19.980
This is permanent.

01:20.013 --> 01:21.582
She's not Mom.

01:21.615 --> 01:22.616
I don't know
how it happened,

01:22.650 --> 01:24.218
but he left me
and went to her.

01:24.252 --> 01:26.154
We have to leave
this house, now.

01:26.187 --> 01:27.054
Okay.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.323
(air rushing)

01:29.357 --> 01:32.260
Time for a family meeting.

01:33.361 --> 01:34.562
(gasping)

01:34.595 --> 01:36.397
ANGELA: I need to hear you
say you'll behave.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.799
KAT: We'll behave!
Please, let her go!

01:38.832 --> 01:40.801
I don't believe you.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.102
(gagging)

01:43.371 --> 01:44.872
Angela!
Please!

01:47.040 --> 01:49.042
(door slams open)

01:50.043 --> 01:52.413
Get the hell away from them.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.482
(breathing heavily)

01:54.515 --> 01:56.850
Now, this just got interesting.

01:56.884 --> 01:58.152
Is everyone okay?

01:58.186 --> 01:59.353
Not really.

01:59.387 --> 02:00.788
KAT:
Please,

02:00.821 --> 02:02.122
you have to help her.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.123
ANGELA:
Mmm.

02:03.157 --> 02:05.659
By all means, help me.

02:05.693 --> 02:08.095
Am I speaking now to the
presence inside Angela Rance?

02:08.128 --> 02:10.164
I'm not possessed, Father.

02:10.198 --> 02:11.432
This is integration.

02:11.465 --> 02:14.268
You know what that means.

02:14.302 --> 02:16.136
There's no Angela left to save.

02:16.170 --> 02:18.639
No prayer that's gonna
bring her back.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.508
There is just me.

02:20.541 --> 02:23.477
I don't believe that
you're integrated.

02:23.511 --> 02:25.213
Which begs the question,

02:25.246 --> 02:27.315
how far are you willing
to take this?

02:32.986 --> 02:34.955
As far as it goes.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.990
Here I thought you were
the cuddly one.

02:37.024 --> 02:38.792
Well, then,

02:38.826 --> 02:40.828
man of God,

02:40.861 --> 02:43.997
let's see the measure
of your conviction.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.602
I cast you out, unclean spirit!

02:49.237 --> 02:51.038
(gasps)

02:54.775 --> 02:56.544
(all gasping)

03:12.793 --> 03:14.228
(screaming)

03:14.262 --> 03:15.929
(yelling, panting)

03:15.963 --> 03:18.198
(Tomas' panting echoes)

03:29.877 --> 03:31.879
(dog barking, men
speaking Spanish in distance)

03:56.236 --> 03:58.539
(speaking Spanish)

03:58.572 --> 04:02.743
You certainly stepped
in it this time.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.247
Marcus?

04:09.650 --> 04:12.085
*

04:34.274 --> 04:37.144
SIMON:
Well, it appears
our friend Angela

04:37.177 --> 04:39.146
won't be joining us, after all.
(breathing heavily)

04:39.179 --> 04:40.414
Domestic trouble.

04:40.448 --> 04:41.682
Such a pity.

04:41.715 --> 04:42.983
MARIA: Simon, I need
to speak with you.

04:43.016 --> 04:45.185
SIMON: Later.
I harvested those ashes.

04:45.218 --> 04:47.921
My people, my work.
They were promised to me.

04:47.955 --> 04:52.926
Oh, Maria, I hope you're not
giving me orders.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.428
It's just that
you promised.

04:54.462 --> 04:57.030
I promised you
due consideration,

04:57.064 --> 04:58.699
which you received.

04:58.732 --> 05:01.835
It's not my fault
you were unsatisfactory.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.714
MARCUS (whispers):
Bennett.

05:13.747 --> 05:15.749
Bennett.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.553
Good news.

05:19.587 --> 05:22.289
You know that mole
inside the church?

05:22.322 --> 05:24.024
I'm starting to think

05:24.057 --> 05:25.959
I might be
onto something.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.962
Guess we can all go home, then.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.432
(Simon chuckles)

05:34.368 --> 05:36.336
The special security liaison

05:36.370 --> 05:37.738
to the Vatican itself,

05:37.771 --> 05:38.806
and Rome's

05:38.839 --> 05:40.841
greatest living exorcist.

05:40.874 --> 05:44.478
The politician and the pit bull.

05:44.512 --> 05:45.513
Either one

05:45.546 --> 05:47.080
would be a feather

05:47.114 --> 05:49.349
fit for the finest cap.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.561
You have two doors
set before you.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.563
(electrical buzzing)
Behind the first door,

06:02.596 --> 06:04.097
is integration.

06:04.131 --> 06:06.934
Join us of your own volition,

06:06.967 --> 06:08.502
and you will know

06:08.536 --> 06:10.370
wealth and power

06:10.404 --> 06:12.840
beyond imagining.

06:12.873 --> 06:16.510
You will drink from
the cupped hands of eternity.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.679
Or choose the second door

06:18.712 --> 06:20.514
and die.

06:20.548 --> 06:21.749
MARCUS:
All eternity

06:21.782 --> 06:24.051
listening to your poncey
little speeches?

06:24.084 --> 06:25.586
Kill me now.

06:25.619 --> 06:28.956
Oh, it's easy to be cavalier
about death

06:28.989 --> 06:31.659
in the abstract.

06:34.562 --> 06:37.698
It's much harder
when one is actually

06:37.731 --> 06:38.699
dying.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.133
(yelling)

06:40.167 --> 06:41.969
(yelling)

06:46.273 --> 06:47.575
You bastard!

06:47.608 --> 06:49.610
Case in point.

06:51.445 --> 06:53.581
(Marcus grunting)

06:53.614 --> 06:56.484
(gasping)

06:58.619 --> 06:59.887
Oh, I'd decide quickly

06:59.920 --> 07:01.689
if I were you.

07:03.524 --> 07:06.627
Ticktock, my lovelies.

07:08.361 --> 07:11.699
*

07:44.898 --> 07:46.466
(dog barking in distance)

07:46.500 --> 07:48.836
This is where I lived
when I was six years old,

07:48.869 --> 07:50.170
with my grandmother.

07:50.203 --> 07:52.806
And now you're back.
No.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.642
I'm dreaming.

07:56.844 --> 07:59.713
This is not real.

07:59.747 --> 08:01.148
You are not real.

08:01.181 --> 08:04.552
Oh, you're gonna
hurt my feelings.

08:06.587 --> 08:07.955
What do you want?

08:07.988 --> 08:10.390
For you to accept
the inevitable.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.162
Integration is permanent,

08:15.195 --> 08:17.064
Tomas.

08:17.097 --> 08:20.167
You can't beat her.
(chuckles)

08:20.200 --> 08:22.335
(chuckling)

08:22.369 --> 08:23.737
Hell, even I couldn't beat her

08:23.771 --> 08:25.338
and I'm actually good at this.

08:25.372 --> 08:27.474
You're not Marcus.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.677
And you're not an exorcist.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.550
Do you remember what I told you?

08:36.584 --> 08:38.586
That I had too much to lose.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.520
Yeah, and then
what happened?

08:40.554 --> 08:42.389
You lost the Rance girl,

08:42.422 --> 08:44.224
you lost the love of your life,

08:44.257 --> 08:47.761
you betrayed everything
you held dear, and for what?

08:47.795 --> 08:49.697
What did it get you?

08:52.900 --> 08:54.334
You're gonna die

08:54.367 --> 08:56.670
in here.

08:56.704 --> 09:00.608
Unless you wake up right now.

09:03.476 --> 09:05.846
TOMAS:
But I don't know how.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.948
Yeah, you do.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.921
ANGELA:
We have a problem.

09:13.954 --> 09:17.858
The world is
about to change,

09:17.891 --> 09:20.227
starting with a pig
in a little white hat,

09:20.260 --> 09:22.730
bleeding out for
all the world to see.

09:22.763 --> 09:25.465
And that kind of change

09:25.498 --> 09:27.567
brings opportunities.

09:27.601 --> 09:28.902
Opportunities that vanish

09:28.936 --> 09:30.738
if my entire family
turns up dead.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.706
And I don't want that. Do you?

09:32.740 --> 09:34.574
I don't want to hurt any of you.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.777
You just got done
choking our daughter.

09:36.810 --> 09:39.579
Well, I was just
disciplining her.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.715
You took my wife.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.617
I took what was mine!

09:49.289 --> 09:50.758
I'm going to kill you.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.295
Now, that's the kind of talk

09:55.328 --> 09:56.596
that we just can't afford.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.398
Marcus is gonna find you.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.567
Well, then, I'll kill him, too.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.302
Really? The way I heard it,

10:02.335 --> 10:05.138
you got your ass handed to you
by a 12-year-old girl.

10:05.172 --> 10:06.640
What kind of all-powerful
demon lets himself

10:06.674 --> 10:08.141
get chucked
out a window?

10:20.287 --> 10:22.322
(demonic voice echoing):
Regan.

10:32.900 --> 10:37.404
SALESMAN:
I thought I got
every last piece of you.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.942
I should've known.

10:41.975 --> 10:45.813
You've been hiding from me.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.981
Like a remora,

10:48.015 --> 10:50.017
sucking on the belly
of a shark.

10:54.654 --> 10:57.224
Hello...

11:01.428 --> 11:03.897
Little Rags

11:03.931 --> 11:07.467
found herself a burrow.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.369
All those years ago.

11:09.402 --> 11:10.804
A place

11:10.838 --> 11:15.743
where you wouldn't feel
anything at all.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.410
(scraping on walls)
And first sign of trouble,

11:17.444 --> 11:21.148
you went scampering back.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.150
(sing-songy):
Little pig.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.818
Little pig.

11:24.852 --> 11:27.721
Let me in!

11:27.755 --> 11:30.657
(pounds on door)
Ah!

11:30.690 --> 11:34.561
You're going to
open the door for me

11:34.594 --> 11:36.997
when you hear what I do

11:37.030 --> 11:38.231
to your wretched family.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.734
Please.
Let them go.

11:40.768 --> 11:44.171
The sounds
they're going to make.

11:44.204 --> 11:47.040
(scraping, then Henry,
Kat, Casey screaming)

11:51.644 --> 11:54.047
I know what you are.

11:54.081 --> 11:57.851
Demon.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.888
Doesn't work like that,
I'm afraid.

12:00.921 --> 12:04.291
Splitting consciousness, all
that bollocks. Hollywood stuff.

12:04.324 --> 12:07.694
I'm you, Tomas.

12:07.727 --> 12:11.198
I'm that little voice
in the back of your head.

12:11.231 --> 12:14.234
I'm every rotten lie
you've ever told.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.468
I'm not a liar.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.404
Oh, really?

12:17.437 --> 12:19.406
You lied about Jessica,

12:19.439 --> 12:21.975
you lied about
hearing God's voice--

12:22.009 --> 12:24.477
that was a personal favorite.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.780
(imitating Tomas crying):
"Look at this family.

12:26.814 --> 12:28.048
See how they are suffering."

12:28.081 --> 12:30.150
I was trying to help.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.985
You were trying
to be special.

12:32.019 --> 12:33.821
You were trying to

12:33.854 --> 12:36.389
pass the buck on every lousy
decision you've ever made.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.658
God didn't want you, Tomas.

12:38.691 --> 12:42.162
He never did.
The first Mexican Pope.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.264
Do you think anyone ever
believed that pile of old tosh?

12:44.297 --> 12:46.599
Stop it!

12:46.633 --> 12:48.435
(breathing heavily)
Your grandma didn't want you
in the Vatican,

12:48.468 --> 12:50.270
she wanted you holding her hand

12:50.303 --> 12:53.006
while she died, but you couldn't
even manage that, could you?

12:53.040 --> 12:56.844
(old woman humming)

12:56.877 --> 13:02.782
(rattling breaths,
humming continues)

13:02.816 --> 13:04.985
(speaks Spanish)

13:05.018 --> 13:06.786
No.

13:13.894 --> 13:16.496
(wheezing, coughing)

13:16.529 --> 13:18.698
(tooth rattles on floor)
TOMAS:
No.

13:24.471 --> 13:28.308
(coughing and
rattling breathing continues)

13:28.341 --> 13:30.710
(whispering):
Truth is, it took weeks.

13:30.743 --> 13:34.314
Weeks, Tomas.

13:40.921 --> 13:43.823
Oh yeah, prayer,
'cause that always works,

13:43.857 --> 13:45.893
doesn't it?

13:45.926 --> 13:47.327
The thing about
bed sores is, eventually,
(breathing heavily)

13:47.360 --> 13:51.064
you become part
of the mattress.

13:51.098 --> 13:53.233
They try and pull you free,

13:53.266 --> 13:55.936
but it's like tearing wet paper.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.073
They open the window

14:00.107 --> 14:02.842
'cause of the smell.
(bones cracking)

14:02.876 --> 14:06.679
(whispering):
That's how the cats got in.

14:06.713 --> 14:08.581
First thing they
went for was the face.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.552
(yells in disgust)

14:12.585 --> 14:14.221
No, that's now how it happened,

14:14.254 --> 14:15.989
I spoke with her
the day before she died.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.757
She said she was proud of me.

14:17.790 --> 14:19.426
MARCUS:
You spoke to her

14:19.459 --> 14:22.062
two weeks before she died.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.497
In the end,
she couldn't even form words.

14:24.531 --> 14:28.701
Withering away into nothing
in that bed.

14:28.735 --> 14:32.672
Look at her.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.707
It's the least you can do.

14:50.657 --> 14:54.327
(rattling breathing,
softly whimpering)

14:57.130 --> 14:59.132
(sobbing)

15:01.334 --> 15:07.274
MARCUS:
Is this what your God wanted?

15:08.508 --> 15:09.876
Look at her.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.612
Was this part of His plan?

15:13.846 --> 15:16.183
(Marcus chuckles)

15:21.288 --> 15:24.324
SIMON:
Drip, drip, drip.

15:24.357 --> 15:27.094
I read about your
time at the boys' home

15:27.127 --> 15:29.396
where they found you.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.632
Shot your own pa
with a poaching rifle.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.403
What's your point?

15:36.436 --> 15:38.171
Why do you think
the Church took you in?

15:38.205 --> 15:40.607
Because of your potential?

15:40.640 --> 15:43.776
Or because they saw
a scared, troubled

15:43.810 --> 15:47.647
child, and knew that
all it would take

15:47.680 --> 15:51.784
was one little push to make you
kill and kill again?

15:51.818 --> 15:53.753
It didn't take much convincing.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.522
That's your legacy.

15:55.555 --> 15:59.426
A lonely trail
that ends in a dreary room

15:59.459 --> 16:03.696
without a single soul
to mourn your passing.

16:03.730 --> 16:07.200
Why die for them, Marcus?

16:07.234 --> 16:11.438
For a Church who never gave
one single damn about you?

16:11.471 --> 16:13.306
He's lying.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.508
No, he isn't.

16:15.542 --> 16:16.776
The parade starts
in ten minutes.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.411
We're running out of time.

16:21.748 --> 16:25.618
They wrung your soul
like a piece of wet laundry.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.287
And after they squeezed

16:27.320 --> 16:30.223
every last drop of
good out of your body,

16:30.257 --> 16:33.193
what did they do?

16:33.226 --> 16:36.796
Excommunication.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.732
Oh, my poor boy.

16:39.766 --> 16:42.369
Don't let your life
be the last thing

16:42.402 --> 16:49.076
they take.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.678
Six blind men...

16:51.711 --> 16:53.513
go into a room.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.882
There's an elephant...
in the room

16:55.915 --> 16:57.217
and they all grab a part,

16:57.250 --> 16:59.219
the trunk,
the-the ear, the tail.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.054
All of them trying to describe

17:01.088 --> 17:05.492
that one little piece
of something greater.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.094
I'm familiar with the story.

17:08.361 --> 17:11.431
Then you should know...

17:11.464 --> 17:14.901
that you're wasting your time.

17:14.934 --> 17:17.537
'Cause I didn't
touch a trunk,

17:17.570 --> 17:19.606
or a tail, or an ear.

17:19.639 --> 17:22.242
I saw the whole damn elephant!

17:22.275 --> 17:24.043
12 years old,

17:24.077 --> 17:26.012
staring down
one of your bastard brothers!

17:26.045 --> 17:29.382
And the world
cracked in half.

17:29.416 --> 17:31.718
And I saw God

17:31.751 --> 17:35.122
on the other side.
(sobbing)

17:37.790 --> 17:39.025
I'm not dying

17:39.058 --> 17:41.461
for the bloody Church.

17:43.896 --> 17:48.235
I am dying for Him.

17:51.138 --> 17:53.506
Simon, we need to leave.

18:03.116 --> 18:07.487
Vocare Pulvere.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.955
(blows)

18:08.988 --> 18:10.890
(electricity buzzes)

18:10.923 --> 18:12.925
(ghostly breathing)

18:17.930 --> 18:19.799
Stop. Wait!

18:22.635 --> 18:25.305
I brought Sebastian.

18:25.338 --> 18:27.073
It was my money,

18:27.106 --> 18:29.008
my resources...
Know your place.

18:29.041 --> 18:32.179
The oxen pulls the plow, Maria.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.381
He doesn't sit
at the farmer's table.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.959
(door closes)

18:46.993 --> 18:50.797
(ghostly breathing resumes)

18:50.830 --> 18:53.132
ANGELA:
We're gonna play a little game.

18:53.166 --> 18:55.702
A game that can end at any time.

18:55.735 --> 18:58.305
And all you have to do, Regan,

18:58.338 --> 19:00.673
is open the damn...

19:00.707 --> 19:04.010
door.

19:07.514 --> 19:08.815
'Round and 'round we go.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.151
(softly):
Oh, my God.

19:28.401 --> 19:29.636
(Angela gasps)

19:29.669 --> 19:31.070
Looks like
we have a winner.

19:31.103 --> 19:34.140
The birdie with
the broken wing.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.375
Aw.

19:35.408 --> 19:36.676
Casey, dear.

19:36.709 --> 19:39.246
I want you to pick up
that hammer.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.248
Let's go.

19:41.281 --> 19:43.516
Come on.
There we go.

19:43.550 --> 19:45.017
Good.

19:45.051 --> 19:47.654
It's okay, baby.
Yeah.

19:47.687 --> 19:51.691
Pick it up.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.360
Good.
There you go.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.194
Now come on over here.

19:55.228 --> 19:58.097
And what I want you to do
with that hammer

19:58.130 --> 20:01.268
is to hit your sister.

20:01.301 --> 20:03.169
Just as hard as you can.
(softly):
What?

20:03.202 --> 20:04.871
ANGELA: Start with the knee.
HENRY: Don't.

20:04.904 --> 20:07.106
Don't do it.

20:07.139 --> 20:08.875
We're not gonna play
your sick little games.

20:08.908 --> 20:12.245
I'm gonna give you until
the count of ten to do it.

20:12.279 --> 20:14.747
Otherwise, I'm gonna tear

20:14.781 --> 20:17.016
both of Daddy Dearest's
arms off.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.918
(rumble, then bones cracking)
No!

20:18.951 --> 20:21.087
(gasping and yelling)

20:21.120 --> 20:23.122
One.

20:23.155 --> 20:24.857
Two.
CASEY: Please, you don't
have to do this, please.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.859
Three.
(crying): Please, no, please!

20:26.893 --> 20:29.195
Listen to me.
I love you both so much.
CASEY: No!

20:29.228 --> 20:32.198
Four.
CASEY:
Please, please don't do this.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.900
HENRY:
Okay, this is not...

20:33.933 --> 20:36.068
this is not your fault,
do you hear me?
CASEY: No!

20:36.102 --> 20:39.071
Five.
Daddy, no.
HENRY:
Every day I wake up,

20:39.105 --> 20:41.608
I'm so proud,
I'm so proud to be your dad.
Six.

20:41.641 --> 20:42.975
Please, please, no!

20:43.009 --> 20:44.544
CASEY: Please.
Do it, Case.
Oh!

20:44.577 --> 20:46.479
Seven.
HENRY:
And your mom,

20:46.513 --> 20:48.214
your mom loves you too.
CASEY:
No, please.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.616
You can't ever forget...

20:49.649 --> 20:51.217
you can't ever forget that!
Eight.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.152
Do it!
I can't!

20:53.185 --> 20:54.253
CASEY: I can't.
Nine.

20:54.287 --> 20:55.922
No!
(Kat screaming)

20:57.690 --> 20:59.125
(rumbling stops)

20:59.158 --> 21:01.494
(laughing)

21:01.528 --> 21:03.062
(gasping and crying)

21:03.095 --> 21:08.401
(sobbing):
No! Leave them alone!

21:08.435 --> 21:10.903
Oh, God.
They didn't do anything.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.940
Leave them alone!

21:13.973 --> 21:15.975
(cries and gasps echoing)

21:16.008 --> 21:18.511
You don't get to run from me.

21:18.545 --> 21:21.013
You don't get
to say no.

21:21.047 --> 21:23.983
All you can do
is open the door

21:24.016 --> 21:27.487
and let me...

21:27.520 --> 21:28.855
in.

21:33.225 --> 21:35.227
(wheezing)

21:36.829 --> 21:38.798
(coughing)

21:49.308 --> 21:50.643
(indistinct demonic whispers)

21:54.847 --> 21:58.351
Ana?

21:58.385 --> 22:00.887
Is that you?

22:02.355 --> 22:04.391
Don't listen to it,
Bennett.

22:04.424 --> 22:06.359
My sister.

22:11.698 --> 22:14.133
I can hear her.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.668
You have to fight this.

22:15.702 --> 22:18.805
Ana...

22:18.838 --> 22:21.508
I'm sorry.
Ana...

22:23.376 --> 22:27.880
Poor little Renfield.

22:27.914 --> 22:30.383
Left all alone
to eat your bugs.

22:30.417 --> 22:32.519
Be quiet.

22:32.552 --> 22:33.653
Do you remember what
happened to Renfield

22:33.686 --> 22:34.921
at the end of the book?

22:34.954 --> 22:38.591
The vampire
crushed his face

22:38.625 --> 22:40.092
and snapped his neck.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.695
You have no idea
the things I've done.

22:42.729 --> 22:46.232
I know you're still
on the bench,

22:46.265 --> 22:49.736
waiting for a call
that's never gonna come.

22:49.769 --> 22:52.004
Renfield!

22:52.038 --> 22:53.239
(indistinct whispering
continues)

22:53.272 --> 22:55.608
Ah...

22:55.642 --> 22:57.043
there you are.

22:57.076 --> 22:59.879
How many times
have you been passed over

22:59.912 --> 23:02.248
for someone younger,
more desirable?

23:02.281 --> 23:05.885
How many times do they
choose a man instead?

23:05.918 --> 23:09.689
Oh, you give 'em
some sweet girl,

23:09.722 --> 23:11.357
they can't wait
to pluck that flower.

23:11.390 --> 23:14.193
But shove a couple
of miles on the clock,

23:14.226 --> 23:16.262
who do they go for?

23:16.295 --> 23:17.530
A man!

23:17.564 --> 23:21.067
Shut up!

23:21.100 --> 23:25.104
Too afraid to take
what's rightfully yours.

23:28.575 --> 23:31.811
Ana, I'm ready.

23:34.447 --> 23:36.883
I am your daughter.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.885
Take me!

23:38.918 --> 23:40.887
(demonic hissing)

23:40.920 --> 23:43.122
(gasping)

23:45.758 --> 23:47.794
(demonic growling)

23:54.867 --> 23:56.469
(wood cracking)

24:00.172 --> 24:01.140
Bennett!

24:01.173 --> 24:03.610
(demonic growling)

24:05.444 --> 24:06.813
Aah!
(bones snap)

24:10.282 --> 24:12.685
Sebastian.

24:12.719 --> 24:14.954
I know.

24:18.525 --> 24:21.360
(groaning quietly)
HENRY: Easy...

24:23.029 --> 24:24.997
MARCUS:
Spend your whole life

24:25.031 --> 24:26.298
denying your nature,

24:26.332 --> 24:29.301
and for what, Tomas?

24:29.335 --> 24:31.270
What are you left with?

24:31.303 --> 24:32.972
Nothing.

24:33.005 --> 24:37.544
Another one of God's
abandoned projects.

24:38.811 --> 24:42.515
Unfinished,
unnoticed,

24:42.549 --> 24:43.950
unloved.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.685
I don't want to be here.
I want to wake up.

24:45.718 --> 24:48.087
Wake up, wake up,
wake up!

24:59.031 --> 25:00.667
(Kat gasping, groaning)

25:05.104 --> 25:08.675
So wake... up.

25:08.708 --> 25:12.311
(Kat gasping)

25:12.344 --> 25:14.581
Oh, my God, Father Tomas,
wake up!

25:16.783 --> 25:19.318
(echoing):
Father Tomas, wake up!

25:19.351 --> 25:21.087
Wake up!

25:33.465 --> 25:36.468
Suicide is a mortal sin.

25:39.271 --> 25:42.241
My soul would be
condemned to Hell.

25:42.274 --> 25:44.076
What are you doing, Tomas?

25:46.145 --> 25:48.080
(Kat panting)

25:49.448 --> 25:50.817
(Kat groans)

26:03.162 --> 26:06.766
Who's ready for round two?

26:06.799 --> 26:08.134
You were right.

26:09.969 --> 26:11.503
I have sinned.

26:13.773 --> 26:15.374
I lied to myself.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.576
I lied

26:17.610 --> 26:19.612
to the people around me.

26:19.646 --> 26:22.081
Mom...

26:22.114 --> 26:23.650
I know you're listening.

26:25.852 --> 26:29.756
I know it's hard, and it hurts,

26:29.789 --> 26:32.291
but you have to fight.

26:36.328 --> 26:37.830
You know what?

26:37.864 --> 26:40.432
(hammer thuds on floor)

26:40.466 --> 26:44.136
I think we've had just about
enough of you, Stinkpot.

26:44.170 --> 26:46.505
No! Stop!
Let her go!

26:46.538 --> 26:48.107
TOMAS:
I told myself I was special.

26:48.140 --> 26:49.575
I gave into temptation.

26:49.608 --> 26:50.910
CASEY:
Stop!

26:50.943 --> 26:53.112
When my grandmother needed me,
I was not there.

26:53.145 --> 26:54.346
When Jessica came to me,

26:54.380 --> 26:56.282
I was not strong.

26:56.315 --> 26:57.583
When Angela asked

26:57.616 --> 26:59.986
for my help...

27:00.019 --> 27:02.021
I was not honest.

27:02.054 --> 27:03.690
(crying out)
HENRY: Stop, Angela!

27:03.723 --> 27:05.257
(growling)
Stop it!

27:05.291 --> 27:06.726
I know you're in there.

27:08.828 --> 27:10.129
You said

27:10.162 --> 27:12.431
I have nothing.

27:12.464 --> 27:13.800
You were wrong.

27:13.833 --> 27:16.836
I have love.

27:16.869 --> 27:18.938
I have hope.

27:18.971 --> 27:21.507
And I have faith.

27:21.540 --> 27:23.042
(voices echoing)
HENRY: Stop it!

27:23.075 --> 27:27.446
TOMAS: These things
are not weaknesses.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.281
They make me what I am.

27:29.315 --> 27:30.649
And what's that?

27:34.486 --> 27:36.789
An exorcist.

27:36.823 --> 27:40.893
HENRY: Angela, stop it!
KAT: Stop! Let her go.

27:40.927 --> 27:44.063
You have got
to be kidding me.

27:46.065 --> 27:48.567
The blood of Christ
redeems you.

27:48.600 --> 27:51.037
The mercy of Christ
absolves you.

27:56.042 --> 27:58.277
The power of Christ
compels you!

28:12.792 --> 28:14.794
(demonic growl, glass shatters)

28:18.530 --> 28:21.734
(crashing, thudding)

28:21.768 --> 28:24.670
TOMAS:
The power of Christ compels you!

28:24.703 --> 28:26.505
It's He who casts you out,

28:26.538 --> 28:28.107
from whose sight
nothing is hidden.
(furniture crashes)

28:28.140 --> 28:29.842
It is He who repels you,

28:29.876 --> 28:31.778
to whose might
all things are subject.

28:31.811 --> 28:33.880
It's He who expels you.

28:33.913 --> 28:35.948
He who has prepared...

28:35.982 --> 28:37.149
(furious demonic growling)

28:39.585 --> 28:41.854
(Tomas praying loudly,
indistinctly)

28:41.888 --> 28:43.355
(demonic growling)

28:43.389 --> 28:46.125
(praying continues,
glass shattering)

28:49.962 --> 28:53.900
HENRY: What are you doing, Case?
Come on, we gotta go!

28:53.933 --> 28:56.368
I'm sorry, I can't.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.370
Casey!

28:58.404 --> 29:00.940
TOMAS:
I command you, unclean spirit,

29:00.973 --> 29:02.208
along with all your minions

29:02.241 --> 29:04.410
now attacking
this servant of God,

29:04.443 --> 29:06.212
by the mysteries
of the Incarnation,

29:06.245 --> 29:07.980
Passion, Resurrection
and Ascension

29:08.014 --> 29:09.715
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

29:09.748 --> 29:12.118
by the coming of
our Lord for judgment,

29:12.151 --> 29:14.753
that you tell me
by some sign your name,

29:14.787 --> 29:17.023
and the day and hour
of your departure!

29:22.294 --> 29:24.797
(crowd chattering)

29:28.667 --> 29:31.503
(cheering)

29:44.050 --> 29:46.185
(panting)

29:51.557 --> 29:54.126
(cheering continues)

29:59.198 --> 30:01.300
TOMAS:
The power of Christ compels you

30:01.333 --> 30:04.270
by the coming of our Lord
for judgment,

30:04.303 --> 30:06.205
that you tell me by some sign
your name...

30:11.978 --> 30:13.612
(demonic voice):
The real priest couldn't come,

30:13.645 --> 30:16.115
so they sent you instead.

30:16.148 --> 30:17.049
Our Father,
who art in Heaven...

30:17.083 --> 30:18.117
Tiny Tomas.

30:18.150 --> 30:20.152
You're drowning
by the second.

30:20.186 --> 30:21.854
...hallowed be Thy name.

30:21.888 --> 30:24.290
ALL: Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,

30:24.323 --> 30:26.993
(echoing):
...on Earth as it is in Heaven.

30:27.026 --> 30:28.694
Give us this day
our daily bread

30:28.727 --> 30:30.462
and forgive us
our trespasses,

30:30.496 --> 30:33.299
(growling)
as we forgive those
who trespass against us,

30:33.332 --> 30:35.234
(praying inaudibly)
...and lead us not
into temptation...

30:35.267 --> 30:37.669
(cheering)

30:54.386 --> 30:56.522
(cheering gets louder)

31:04.563 --> 31:06.465
(sharp ringing)

31:10.569 --> 31:12.571
(crowd screaming)

31:19.378 --> 31:22.014
St. Anthony, disperser
of devils, pray for us.

31:22.048 --> 31:25.617
St. Anthony, reviver
of the dead, pray for us.
(speaking in Spanish)

31:25.651 --> 31:27.186
St. Anthony,

31:27.219 --> 31:29.088
tamer of tyrants,
pray for us.

31:29.121 --> 31:30.356
(growls)

31:30.389 --> 31:32.258
From the snares of the devil,

31:32.291 --> 31:34.226
St. Anthony deliver us.

31:34.260 --> 31:36.428
From thunder,
lightning and storms...
(growling)

31:36.462 --> 31:38.797
...St. Anthony deliver us.

31:38.830 --> 31:41.367
Lamb of God, who takes away
the sins of the world,

31:41.400 --> 31:43.402
spare us, O Lord.

31:43.435 --> 31:46.905
I'm tired.
(growling continues)

31:48.107 --> 31:49.408
(grunts)

31:49.441 --> 31:50.809
(praying in Spanish)
(growls)

31:50.842 --> 31:53.612
Give us this day
our daily bread.

31:53.645 --> 31:56.148
(snarling)

31:56.182 --> 31:58.117
Tired of spending my life

31:58.150 --> 32:00.652
looking over my shoulder,

32:00.686 --> 32:03.222
watching you hurt my family.

32:03.255 --> 32:05.157
(growls)

32:05.191 --> 32:07.026
I'm tired of letting you win!

32:08.294 --> 32:09.828
(inhales)

32:09.861 --> 32:11.263
You want me?

32:11.297 --> 32:12.898
Come and get me.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.933
*

32:43.495 --> 32:46.265
*

32:46.298 --> 32:47.766
(roars)

32:47.799 --> 32:50.202
...restorer of sight
to the blind, pray for us.

32:50.236 --> 32:52.438
St. Anthony...
(speaking in Spanish)

32:52.471 --> 32:54.440
(demonic voice):
Do it. Snuff the bitch!

32:54.473 --> 32:56.308
Right in front
of her squealing pups.

32:56.342 --> 32:58.777
I'm not going to kill you.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.346
St. Anthony,
tamer of tyrants...

33:00.379 --> 33:02.648
I'm going to save you.

33:05.084 --> 33:08.220
The Morning Star
sends his greetings.

33:08.254 --> 33:09.855
And I send mine.

33:09.888 --> 33:11.157
(choking)

33:11.190 --> 33:14.360
(coughing, gasping)

33:17.396 --> 33:19.665
Yield to God!

33:19.698 --> 33:22.468
Yield to God!
Yield to God!

33:22.501 --> 33:23.902
You can't do this.

33:23.935 --> 33:25.137
(grunting)

33:25.171 --> 33:26.872
You have no right!

33:26.905 --> 33:29.075
You're just a damned woman!

33:29.108 --> 33:32.211
TOMAS: Yield to God!
(screams)

33:32.244 --> 33:33.979
Yield to God!

33:34.012 --> 33:35.147
Yield to God!

33:35.181 --> 33:36.148
Yield to God!

33:36.182 --> 33:37.949
(crunches)

33:40.018 --> 33:41.420
(snaps)

33:41.453 --> 33:43.855
(screaming)

33:43.889 --> 33:45.591
(girls sob)

33:45.624 --> 33:48.260
Son of the morning, banished
from grace, you are forgiven.

33:48.294 --> 33:50.162
Son of the morning,

33:50.196 --> 33:52.931
profane thing, ashes
on the earth, you are redeemed.

33:52.964 --> 33:55.501
(crying)

33:55.534 --> 33:57.436
Outcast, fallen angel,

33:57.469 --> 34:00.106
you are loved.

34:15.954 --> 34:17.956
(screaming)

34:31.403 --> 34:33.539
SALESMAN (crying):
No, don't...

34:33.572 --> 34:34.806
don't leave me...

34:34.840 --> 34:38.477
Rags? Don't
leave me. Rags?

34:38.510 --> 34:40.112
(crying):
Don't...

34:40.146 --> 34:42.981
(shouting):
Ra...

34:43.014 --> 34:45.617
*

34:48.320 --> 34:49.555
HENRY:
Hey, Angie...

34:49.588 --> 34:51.457
KAT:
Oh, my God...
Angie?

34:51.490 --> 34:54.092
Mom!
Oh, my God...

34:54.126 --> 34:55.927
KAT:
No...

34:55.961 --> 34:57.196
(girls crying)

35:08.607 --> 35:10.609
CASEY:
So I guess this is it.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.312
What?

35:14.546 --> 35:16.515
I spent God knows
how many hours

35:16.548 --> 35:18.184
staring at that damn
face of yours,

35:18.217 --> 35:20.018
all snotted up,
half the time

35:20.051 --> 35:22.354
trying to bite me.

35:22.388 --> 35:24.122
Much prefer this version.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.862
The other people you, um...

35:31.863 --> 35:33.365
...rescued.

35:33.399 --> 35:35.167
Like me.

35:35.201 --> 35:36.835
Do you ever keep tabs on them?

35:36.868 --> 35:39.171
I tried.

35:39.205 --> 35:40.872
Best I could.

35:41.907 --> 35:43.709
How many got better?

35:46.178 --> 35:47.879
Some.

35:47.913 --> 35:50.482
Not all.

35:50.516 --> 35:52.551
Some people...
(sighs)

35:52.584 --> 35:54.453
...they stay in
that pain forever,

35:54.486 --> 35:58.056
'cause they don't think
anyone else will believe them.

35:58.089 --> 36:00.158
Or understand
what they went through.

36:00.192 --> 36:02.961
So how do you get past it?

36:02.994 --> 36:04.696
(exhales)

36:04.730 --> 36:06.164
You tell yourself,

36:06.198 --> 36:08.133
I'm still here.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.735
And I'll be here tomorrow

36:09.768 --> 36:11.703
and the day after.

36:11.737 --> 36:14.273
And it wasn't my fault.

36:17.075 --> 36:19.245
'Cause that's the deal
we make with the world

36:19.278 --> 36:22.714
every time we get out of bed
in the morning.

36:22.748 --> 36:25.150
Hurt me all you want,

36:25.183 --> 36:27.753
but the bastards
don't get to win.

36:29.421 --> 36:31.590
(voice breaking):
What if I'm not strong enough?

36:35.394 --> 36:38.597
Then I'd say that, in the 40-odd
years I've been doing this...

36:39.965 --> 36:41.600
...I've never seen anyone

36:41.633 --> 36:44.236
fight longer or harder

36:44.270 --> 36:46.705
than Casey Rance.

36:46.738 --> 36:48.374
You might just be
the strongest person

36:48.407 --> 36:50.208
I've ever met in my whole life.

36:51.443 --> 36:53.412
HENRY:
Case.

36:53.445 --> 36:55.381
Time to go, honey.

37:05.257 --> 37:07.659
(whispering):
Thank you.

37:08.827 --> 37:10.796
Remember that.

37:10.829 --> 37:12.898
They don't get to win.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.642
(car door opens, closes)

37:23.675 --> 37:26.044
REPORTER:
...new amateur footage
has been released

37:26.077 --> 37:27.613
of the event that claimed
one man's life

37:27.646 --> 37:29.281
following last week's
papal parade...

37:29.315 --> 37:31.317
I'm surprised
you didn't skedaddle

37:31.350 --> 37:33.585
off to Rome
with the rest of them.

37:33.619 --> 37:35.887
You Know Who
certainly didn't hang around.

37:35.921 --> 37:39.090
You do realize that defacing
a Bible is sacrilege.

37:39.124 --> 37:41.493
Redacting.
(clears throat)

37:41.527 --> 37:43.862
Not defacing.
There's a difference.

37:45.263 --> 37:46.798
Half of the book

37:46.832 --> 37:48.900
is full of bird drawings.
Oh!

37:48.934 --> 37:52.371
That. Oh, yeah.
That part's defacing.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.278
I'll be in touch.

38:04.883 --> 38:07.152
Do try to stay
out of trouble.

38:14.526 --> 38:16.528
Where will you start?

38:16.562 --> 38:19.297
Oof. Wherever the wind takes me.

38:19.331 --> 38:22.200
Uh, I might get lucky,

38:22.233 --> 38:25.337
Pop up in the visions
of some other priest.

38:25.371 --> 38:28.039
Preferably one who also
appreciates the subtle nuances

38:28.073 --> 38:29.775
of Nicolas Cage.

38:29.808 --> 38:32.210
What if I asked you to stay?

38:32.243 --> 38:35.347
Train me.
To become an exorcist.

38:35.381 --> 38:38.517
Understand what
you're asking, Tomas.

38:39.585 --> 38:41.520
There's no
retirement home

38:41.553 --> 38:43.955
for people like us.

38:43.989 --> 38:46.324
You go after them,
they hunt you down.

38:46.358 --> 38:50.228
They strip you
of everything you hold dear.

38:50.261 --> 38:53.732
Sooner or later, you'll die
in some stinking room,

38:53.765 --> 38:55.667
with one of those things
standing over you.

38:55.701 --> 38:58.570
I know the costs.

38:58.604 --> 39:00.772
Then why?

39:02.841 --> 39:04.776
The demon.

39:05.777 --> 39:07.413
When it died.

39:08.447 --> 39:10.115
For just a moment...

39:12.183 --> 39:14.886
...I saw God.

39:14.920 --> 39:18.590
I saw His true face.

39:18.624 --> 39:21.993
That's how they get you.

39:22.027 --> 39:24.262
First hit's always free.

39:24.295 --> 39:27.499
How is it that you always manage
to get exactly what you want?

39:27.533 --> 39:29.267
We had a minor setback.

39:29.300 --> 39:30.869
Simon is dead.

39:30.902 --> 39:32.438
Sebastian's alive.

39:32.471 --> 39:34.440
Sebastian was never
the finish line.

39:34.473 --> 39:36.207
And Simon got greedy.

39:36.241 --> 39:39.310
We are not going
to make the same mistake.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.948
I don't know why.

39:43.982 --> 39:46.952
But He chose me.

39:48.987 --> 39:52.190
And I am going
to get out of the boat

39:52.223 --> 39:54.225
and start walking.

39:57.629 --> 39:59.798
Oh, well, then.

39:59.831 --> 40:02.267
In that case...

40:08.940 --> 40:10.942
*

40:28.193 --> 40:30.161
(birds chirping)

40:30.195 --> 40:32.197
*

40:37.869 --> 40:39.871
(Casey and Kat speaking
indistinctly)

41:01.126 --> 41:03.128
How do you feel?

41:04.229 --> 41:06.197
Safe.
