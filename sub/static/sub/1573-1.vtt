00:23.238 --> 00:25.198
<i>Battle for Ringo Vinda.</i>

00:25.240 --> 00:27.784
<i>Republic forces
are locked in heated combat</i>

00:27.826 --> 00:30.704
<i>with the droid armada
on a massive space station</i>

00:30.746 --> 00:33.039
<i>that encircles an entire planet.</i>

00:33.081 --> 00:36.459
<i>Anakin Skywalker valiantly leads
his men against the onslaught,</i>

00:36.501 --> 00:38.253
<i>which has lasted several rotations</i>

00:38.294 --> 00:41.381
<i>with neither side gaining any ground.</i>

00:41.423 --> 00:45.051
<i>Aided by the twin sister
Jedi Masters Tiplee and Tiplar,</i>

00:45.093 --> 00:47.345
<i>the Republic now mounts
a desperate offensive</i>

00:47.387 --> 00:49.431
<i>to break the deadlock.</i>

00:55.937 --> 00:58.398
Push forward!

00:58.440 --> 01:00.024
Stay to my left.

01:00.066 --> 01:01.401
Fives! Watch out!

01:04.446 --> 01:06.573
Thanks, brother.
I owe you one.

01:06.615 --> 01:08.491
You owe me a lot more than one.

01:20.629 --> 01:21.922
Tighten our flank!

01:27.761 --> 01:28.720
Shields up!

01:28.762 --> 01:30.305
<i> Yes, sir!</i>

01:54.162 --> 01:58.291
Don't get too comfortable.
This battle hasn't been won yet.

01:58.333 --> 02:01.210
Master Skywalker,
we must get to the command post.

02:01.252 --> 02:03.296
Admiral Trench
has sent for reinforcements.

02:03.338 --> 02:07.467
We must take this post
before they arrive.

02:07.509 --> 02:10.720
It's time for phase two.
We're at this position.

02:10.762 --> 02:13.222
Tiplar, you'll take your men
down this passageway.

02:13.264 --> 02:15.016
Tiplee, you'll move along here.

02:15.057 --> 02:17.018
They'll have to divide
their forces to counter us.

02:17.059 --> 02:18.770
And when they do, Rex and I
will press through the middle.

02:18.812 --> 02:22.440
If we time it right, we'll all
converge on this spot at the same time,

02:22.482 --> 02:24.150
and the droids
won't know what hit them.

02:24.192 --> 02:26.611
If we're making a run,
we'll need backup.

02:26.653 --> 02:28.864
My men are severely depleted.

02:28.905 --> 02:31.658
Fives, you and Tup
take ten of your best men

02:31.700 --> 02:35.203
- and support Master Tiplar.
- We're on it, sir.

02:37.413 --> 02:39.666
- Hey, you all right?
- Yeah.

02:39.708 --> 02:42.794
- I... I just...
- Come on. This is a textbook battle.

02:42.836 --> 02:45.505
We've run through this a
million times before in training.

02:45.547 --> 02:46.631
Yeah, I know.

02:46.673 --> 02:50.301
I just...
I don't feel like myself.

02:50.343 --> 02:52.679
What do you mean?

02:55.055 --> 02:58.727
- Follow me.
- Jedi.

02:58.768 --> 03:01.021
Tup, what's the matter with you?

03:01.061 --> 03:03.773
Uh, nothing.
I'm fine.

03:03.815 --> 03:07.360
Come on, brother.
Don't want to be left behind.

03:40.769 --> 03:45.857
Increase our defenses.
We must hold them here.

04:01.122 --> 04:04.000
Don't fall back!
Push forward!

04:06.168 --> 04:10.214
Tup, hey, this is not the time
to freeze up. Pull it together.

04:10.256 --> 04:12.926
We're almost to the finish line.
Come on!

04:26.773 --> 04:28.316
Jedi.

04:30.110 --> 04:33.655
Good soldiers follow orders.

04:33.696 --> 04:36.658
- Hey, Tup!
- On your right!

04:38.994 --> 04:42.038
Tup, no!

04:42.080 --> 04:43.498
Sister!

04:52.841 --> 04:54.843
Hold your position!

04:57.512 --> 05:00.682
Destroyers!

05:05.227 --> 05:08.731
We've lost our momentum.
Fall back!

05:11.526 --> 05:13.361
Fives, I don't know
what's going on,

05:13.402 --> 05:14.946
but you are responsible
for Tup now.

05:14.988 --> 05:17.032
Get him back to base.
I want answers.

05:43.641 --> 05:46.019
The Jedi have withdrawn their forces.

05:46.061 --> 05:48.563
Contact Count Dooku immediately.

05:50.773 --> 05:54.652
I have something
he'll be very interested in.

06:00.783 --> 06:05.705
Count Dooku, the Republic
forces are in full retreat.

06:05.747 --> 06:10.250
<i>But this is not why
you have contacted me, is it?</i>

06:10.292 --> 06:13.295
No, Count.
In truth, the Republic

06:13.337 --> 06:15.882
had pushed my droids
to the breaking point

06:15.924 --> 06:18.634
when they suddenly turned
and fell back.

06:20.511 --> 06:22.805
It seemed that
at the height of the conflict,

06:22.847 --> 06:26.601
a clone turned
on his Jedi General and...

06:27.977 --> 06:30.438
executed her.

06:30.479 --> 06:32.440
<i>Intentionally?</i>

06:32.481 --> 06:34.859
I saw it with my own eyes.

06:34.901 --> 06:38.738
I have studied clones and fought
against them in many battles.

06:38.780 --> 06:42.867
This action is unlike
anything I have witnessed

06:42.909 --> 06:45.787
in their behavior as soldiers.

06:45.828 --> 06:48.790
<i>So there is a traitor in their midst.</i>

06:48.831 --> 06:52.752
<i>It's rare, but such things
have been reported in the past.</i>

06:54.294 --> 06:59.092
Not a traitor.
This was different, it seemed.

06:59.134 --> 07:00.718
<i>Yes, Admiral?</i>

07:00.760 --> 07:04.806
It seemed as if the clone
could not help himself,

07:04.847 --> 07:07.976
as if he was entranced.

07:08.017 --> 07:12.897
<i>Thank you, Admiral.
I will take this under advisement.</i>

07:29.664 --> 07:33.168
Why?
Why would he do this?

07:33.209 --> 07:35.211
I'm about to find out.

07:37.797 --> 07:39.007
How's he doing, Rex?

07:39.048 --> 07:45.596
I'm not sure, General.
It seems like he just snapped.

07:45.638 --> 07:49.350
- Tup, can you hear me?
- Yes, Captain.

07:49.391 --> 07:52.061
- What happened?
- What do you mean?

07:52.103 --> 07:55.439
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

07:55.481 --> 07:57.533
Good soldiers follow orders.

07:57.775 --> 07:59.194
Good soldiers follow orders.

07:59.235 --> 08:01.612
<i>Good soldiers follow orders.</i>

08:01.654 --> 08:02.847
<i>Good soldiers follow orders.</i>

08:02.989 --> 08:04.916
<i>Good soldiers follow orders.</i>

08:05.158 --> 08:06.893
Good soldiers follow orders.

08:07.035 --> 08:08.086
Good soldiers follow orders.

08:08.328 --> 08:11.622
- What is he talking about?
- I have no idea.

08:11.664 --> 08:13.049
Good soldiers follow orders.

08:13.291 --> 08:14.984
Good soldiers follow orders.

08:15.126 --> 08:16.886
Good soldiers follow orders.

08:17.128 --> 08:18.596
Good soldiers follow orders.

08:18.838 --> 08:19.964
Good soldiers follow orders.

08:20.206 --> 08:23.092
Good soldiers follow orders.

08:23.134 --> 08:25.261
Kill the Jedi.

08:25.303 --> 08:26.846
Ah!

08:33.727 --> 08:35.604
We have to get him back
to the medical bay

08:35.645 --> 08:38.024
before he hurts anyone else.

08:46.657 --> 08:50.953
My lord, I have received a report
that leads me to conclude

08:50.995 --> 08:54.374
we may have encountered
a grave complication

08:54.415 --> 08:55.624
with one of our assets.

08:55.666 --> 08:57.126
<i>Assets?</i>

08:57.168 --> 08:58.920
Yes, sir.

08:58.961 --> 09:02.464
A clone trooper has executed
one of the Jedi generals.

09:02.506 --> 09:06.802
<i>And you believe this is
indicative of our programming?</i>

09:06.844 --> 09:11.182
I do, my lord.
But I cannot be certain.

09:11.224 --> 09:16.062
<i>It is pertinent we ascertain
if this is an isolated event,</i>

09:16.104 --> 09:20.108
<i>a failure in this particular
clone's programming.</i>

09:20.149 --> 09:23.527
<i>Otherwise, my plans may be ruined.</i>

09:23.569 --> 09:26.864
<i>Seize the clone immediately.</i>

09:26.906 --> 09:29.533
Yes, my master.

09:39.085 --> 09:43.089
Fives, what's happening to me?

09:43.131 --> 09:47.218
- You don't remember?
- No.

09:47.260 --> 09:51.597
- You murdered General Tiplar.
- What? No.

09:51.639 --> 09:53.515
<i>That's not possible.</i>

09:53.557 --> 09:57.686
I would never...
I could never...

09:57.728 --> 10:00.940
- Tup, you did.
- I don't...

10:00.982 --> 10:03.901
<i>I don't understand.
How could this happen?</i>

10:03.943 --> 10:05.027
What's happening to me, Fives?

10:05.069 --> 10:07.571
Ah!
Ah! No!

10:07.613 --> 10:08.990
No!

10:15.496 --> 10:16.914
What do you think happened?

10:16.956 --> 10:21.961
- Did you check all of his scans?
- Well, all of his scans are clear.

10:22.003 --> 10:25.256
As far as I can tell, this is
a combat-related stress.

10:25.298 --> 10:27.883
It seems he's had
some sort of breakdown.

10:27.925 --> 10:29.927
Kix, you should know better.

10:29.969 --> 10:32.805
We were designed
to withstand any stress.

10:32.847 --> 10:36.351
I agree.
We've been through a lot together.

10:36.392 --> 10:38.769
He doesn't seem
to remember what happened.

10:38.811 --> 10:40.980
It's like he's sick or drugged.

10:41.022 --> 10:47.445
Well, it could be a virus, a toxin.
I can't be certain.

10:47.487 --> 10:49.030
Let's talk outside.

10:52.533 --> 10:56.578
You mean the enemy
could've made him do this?

10:56.620 --> 10:58.998
It's a possibility.
There have been rumors

10:59.040 --> 11:02.835
that Separatists have been trying
to develop an anti-clone virus...

11:02.877 --> 11:04.712
biological warfare.

11:04.753 --> 11:08.132
Listen, we aren't equipped
for this type of situation.

11:08.174 --> 11:11.010
He'll have to be taken back to Kamino.

11:11.052 --> 11:13.471
Only then will you have your answer.

11:17.350 --> 11:18.893
<i>Wait, wait!</i>

11:20.478 --> 11:26.150
Tup, it's gonna be fine, I promise.
They'll fix you up real good.

11:26.192 --> 11:28.277
We'll be having a drink together
in no time, eh?

11:28.319 --> 11:31.364
Good soldiers follow orders.

11:31.406 --> 11:33.324
Good... soldiers...

11:33.366 --> 11:38.496
- You are a good soldier, Tup.
- It's time to go now.

11:38.538 --> 11:42.375
- Be careful.
- Yes, General.

12:20.037 --> 12:21.747
We are tracking clean.

12:21.789 --> 12:25.251
Calculating hyperspace jump
in five, four...

12:25.293 --> 12:26.794
<i>Whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait.</i>

12:26.835 --> 12:29.255
<i>Scanners indicate incoming craft.
Abort jump!</i>

13:03.331 --> 13:06.250
Mayday! Mayday!
The enemy has cut us off.

13:06.292 --> 13:08.210
<i>They must've
circled around behind us.</i>

13:08.252 --> 13:09.837
<i>We're being overwhelmed.</i>

13:41.160 --> 13:43.287
Can't let 'em in here.
Hold that line.

13:48.209 --> 13:49.502
Here they come!

13:51.212 --> 13:52.672
Blast 'em!

14:48.394 --> 14:50.896
General Skywalker,
you're nearing the coordinates

14:50.938 --> 14:52.940
where we lost contact
with the shuttle.

14:52.981 --> 14:56.611
<i> We can see it now.
It doesn't look good.</i>

15:03.409 --> 15:06.912
Look like some buzz droids got on
the hull and opened it right up.

15:06.954 --> 15:08.623
Hmm.

15:08.664 --> 15:10.874
Strategically, this attack
doesn't make any sense.

15:10.916 --> 15:14.044
Unless they were after
something specific.

15:14.086 --> 15:16.046
- Tup!
- I'm going over there.

15:16.088 --> 15:17.548
We're coming with you.

15:45.033 --> 15:47.911
<i>Over here.
This is Tup's gurney.</i>

15:50.164 --> 15:53.417
The restraints have been cut.

15:53.459 --> 15:56.378
The clankers took Tup?
Why?

15:56.420 --> 15:59.632
They must be responsible for
whatever's happening to him.

15:59.674 --> 16:02.802
It's possible. All I know
is, they went to great lengths

16:02.843 --> 16:05.095
to capture him,
and that means something.

16:05.137 --> 16:07.139
We have got to get him back.

16:07.181 --> 16:11.185
Don't worry.
We'll find a way.

16:15.272 --> 16:18.400
We have captured the clone, Count.

16:18.442 --> 16:22.279
<i>Good work, Admiral.
Send him to me immediately.</i>

16:22.321 --> 16:25.783
<i>And under all circumstances,
keep him alive.</i>

16:25.825 --> 16:27.743
Yes, sir.

16:29.119 --> 16:32.414
Get him on the next shuttle
out of here.

16:32.456 --> 16:37.461
- But the Republic blockade...
- See to it personally, Commander.

16:50.182 --> 16:52.184
It will be just three of us going in.

16:52.226 --> 16:54.186
The shuttle will drop us off
just short of the main hangar.

16:54.228 --> 16:55.937
Then we space-walk from there.

16:55.979 --> 16:58.190
Are you picking anything up
on Tup's locator?

16:58.232 --> 17:00.942
I've got a faint signal,
but it's hard to track.

17:00.984 --> 17:04.530
- It's moving.
- Then we'd better hurry.

17:41.316 --> 17:45.028
I've got a better signal.
Tup is heading this way.

17:45.070 --> 17:46.906
They're moving him to the hangar.

18:17.269 --> 18:22.441
- Are your scopes Jedi-issue, sir?
- Stay focused, Fives.

18:28.113 --> 18:31.283
<i>- There he is, sir.
- We'll have to work fast.</i>

18:31.325 --> 18:33.744
<i> There must be a
hundred droids in that hangar,</i>

18:33.786 --> 18:37.915
not to mention the starfighters.
This is stretching it even for you, sir.

18:37.957 --> 18:39.834
Rex, you're beginning
to sound like Obi-Wan.

18:39.875 --> 18:41.251
You got a better idea?

18:41.293 --> 18:44.171
Look, I don't doubt
you could pull it off,

18:44.212 --> 18:47.842
but I'm just not sure Fives and I
would be around to see it happen.

18:47.883 --> 18:52.638
- I've got an idea.
- Well, let's hear it. Quickly!

18:52.680 --> 18:54.807
Grappling gun.
Good thinking.

18:54.849 --> 18:59.436
- Get ready to hold on.
- That's why he's the ARC trooper.

19:25.337 --> 19:29.132
- Is there a problem?
- We were experiencing some drag,

19:29.174 --> 19:31.552
but the sensors are stabilized now.

19:31.593 --> 19:35.347
You were experiencing drag
in the vacuum of space?

19:35.389 --> 19:39.476
Yeah, strange.
But it is gone now.

19:52.573 --> 19:53.949
Scrap 'em!

20:18.181 --> 20:21.852
Hey, now we're
experiencing turbul...

20:21.894 --> 20:24.855
What's going on?
What do you know about this clone?

20:24.897 --> 20:28.483
I am programmed to resist intimidation.

20:28.525 --> 20:29.526
Fine.

20:35.407 --> 20:37.868
- How's he doing?
- Not well.

20:37.910 --> 20:41.872
Not well at all.
I think he's dying, sir.

20:41.914 --> 20:43.916
We have to get him to Kamino.

21:03.393 --> 21:05.270
<i>I'll want a full report from Kamino.</i>

21:05.312 --> 21:07.815
If Tup is the victim
of some Separatist plot,

21:07.856 --> 21:10.609
we have no idea of how
widespread it already is.

21:12.861 --> 21:15.864
Permission to come with you, sir.
He's my best friend.

21:15.906 --> 21:20.410
- You may need help.
