WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.404
- MY NAME IS MICHAEL WESTEN.

00:03.437 --> 00:05.506
I USED TO BE A SPY UNTIL--
[phone rings]

00:05.539 --> 00:07.375
- WE GOT A BURN NOTICE ON YOU.
YOU'RE BLACKLISTED.

00:07.408 --> 00:08.642
- [whistles]

00:08.676 --> 00:10.978
WHEN YOU'RE BURNED,
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING.

00:11.011 --> 00:13.214
NO CASH, NO CREDIT,
NO JOB HISTORY.

00:13.247 --> 00:14.982
YOU'RE STUCK IN WHATEVER CITY
THEY DECIDE TO DUMP YOU IN.

00:15.015 --> 00:18.018
WHERE AM I?
- MIAMI.

00:18.052 --> 00:21.322
- YOU DO WHATEVER WORK
COMES YOUR WAY.

00:21.355 --> 00:22.556
YOU RELY ON ANYONE
WHO'S STILL TALKING TO YOU.

00:22.590 --> 00:23.991
[laughs]

00:24.024 --> 00:26.327
A TRIGGER-HAPPY GIRLFRIEND...
- SHOULD WE SHOOT THEM?

00:26.360 --> 00:29.663
- AN OLD FRIEND WHO USED TO
INFORM ON YOU TO THE FBI...

00:29.697 --> 00:31.099
- YOU KNOW SPIES.
BUNCH OF BITCHY LITTLE GIRLS.

00:31.132 --> 00:33.201
- FAMILY TOO...
- HEY, IS THAT YOUR MOM AGAIN?

00:33.234 --> 00:34.202
- IF YOU'RE DESPERATE.

00:34.235 --> 00:35.369
- SOMEONE NEEDS YOUR HELP,
MICHAEL.

00:35.403 --> 00:38.572
- AND A DOWN-AND-OUT SPY
YOU MET ALONG THE WAY.

00:38.606 --> 00:40.108
- THAT'S HOW WE DO IT, PEOPLE.

00:40.141 --> 00:41.575
- BOTTOM LINE--

00:41.609 --> 00:44.945
AS LONG AS YOU'RE BURNED,
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

00:46.414 --> 00:47.848
- IT'S A DEEP COVER JOB
GOING AFTER

00:47.881 --> 00:48.882
THE LEADER
OF A TERRORIST NETWORK.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.718
- TWO-HOUR NOTICE
TO GET TO CUBA

00:50.751 --> 00:52.353
TO BUST SOMEBODY
OUT OF A RUSSIAN BLACK SITE?

00:52.386 --> 00:54.122
- IT'S A WOMAN.
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

00:54.155 --> 00:56.190
- SHE MUST BE
PRETTY DAMN IMPORTANT.

00:56.224 --> 00:58.692
- SHE COULD BE THE KEY
TO WHAT HIS GROUP IS UP TO.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.694
- I WANT A SEAT
AT THE TABLE, SONYA.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.796
- TO DO WHAT WE DO,
YOU HAVE TO BE

01:02.830 --> 01:04.132
WILLING TO GIVE UP
EVERYTHING.

01:04.165 --> 01:05.766
- I HAVE NOTHING!

01:05.799 --> 01:07.067
MY FRIENDS...

01:07.101 --> 01:08.602
THEY MOVED ON.

01:08.636 --> 01:11.505
YOU'RE THE ONLY THING
I HAVE LEFT.

01:15.976 --> 01:17.945
- MICHAEL ALLEN WESTEN,
WELCOME.

01:17.978 --> 01:20.114
I AM THE MAN YOU'VE BEEN
WAITING TO MEET.

01:20.148 --> 01:22.616
- I'LL TELL YOU WHATEVER
YOU WANT TO KNOW.

01:22.650 --> 01:23.984
- OLD LOYALTIES DIE HARD,

01:24.017 --> 01:26.287
AND I NEED TO KNOW
THAT YOU'VE LEFT YOURS BEHIND.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.288
[siren blaring]

01:27.321 --> 01:28.656
WHO WAS YOUR TRAINING OFFICER?

01:28.689 --> 01:31.959
WHEN WERE YOU RECRUITED BY
THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY?

01:31.992 --> 01:34.462
DESCRIBE YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

01:34.495 --> 01:37.498
- A MAN WHO HAS NO SECRETS
CAN TRUST HIMSELF.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.800
- I TOLD YOU.
THIS ONE'S A KEEPER.

01:39.833 --> 01:42.670
- I'M JAMES.

01:42.703 --> 01:46.707
WELCOME TO THE FAMILY.

01:51.279 --> 01:55.283
[people chattering]

01:55.316 --> 01:57.318
[ticking]

02:06.660 --> 02:08.996
- THERE ARE FEW THINGS
RISKIER THAN TAKING DOWN

02:09.029 --> 02:13.467
A HIGH PRIORITY TARGET DURING
A MEETING IN A PUBLIC PLACE.

02:13.501 --> 02:17.671
YOU'RE USUALLY OPERATING ALONE,
OUT OF RADIO CONTACT,

02:17.705 --> 02:19.973
SURROUNDED BY CIVILIANS,

02:20.007 --> 02:24.011
WHILE YOUR SUPPORT HAS TO STAY
OUT OF SIGHT, OFTEN BLOCKS AWAY,

02:24.044 --> 02:27.014
SO THEY WON'T BE DETECTED.

02:27.047 --> 02:28.616
- OKAY, EVERYBODY,
THIS IS IT.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.884
TARGET'S AT THE MEETING
WITH WESTEN AT NOON.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.520
WE ARE NOW AT THREE MINUTES
UNTIL NOON.

02:32.553 --> 02:34.322
BRAVO TEAM,
YOU GOT ANYTHING?

02:34.355 --> 02:35.323
- NOTHING YET.

02:35.356 --> 02:36.557
- ALPHA TEAM?

02:36.590 --> 02:38.359
- NO SIGN OF THEM.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.694
- YOU GET STOOD UP,
SWEETHEART?

02:40.728 --> 02:43.897
- NO, I'M JUST EARLY.

02:43.931 --> 02:47.968
THE HARDEST PART OF THE JOB IS
THAT, UNTIL THE TARGET SHOWS UP,

02:48.001 --> 02:51.572
YOUR JOB IS TO JUST SIT THERE
AND TRY TO ACT NATURAL.

02:55.843 --> 02:58.912
THE THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT
YOU'RE NOT JUST SETTING A TRAP,

02:58.946 --> 03:01.148
YOU'RE ALSO THE BAIT.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.183
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
LOOK SHARP, EVERYBODY.

03:03.217 --> 03:05.819
YOU SEE JAMES, YOU SEE ANYBODY
WHO COULD BE JAMES,

03:05.853 --> 03:07.355
YOU CALL IT IN.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.922
WE'RE NOT GONNA MISS
THIS SON OF A BITCH.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.858
- YOU DROPPED
YOUR PHONE, HON.

03:10.891 --> 03:11.925
A CUSTOMER FOUND IT.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.227
- OH, THAT'S NOT MY PHONE.

03:13.261 --> 03:16.564
- [chuckles] SWEETHEART,
I'M PRETTY SURE IT IS.

03:16.597 --> 03:19.700
SWEET, LITTLE BOY.
IS HE YOURS?

03:19.733 --> 03:21.669
- HE'S MY NEPHEW.

03:21.702 --> 03:24.905
UH, YES, THIS IS MY PHONE.
THANK YOU.

03:24.938 --> 03:28.376
[phone ringing]

03:33.781 --> 03:36.183
[beeps]

03:36.216 --> 03:37.418
A LITTLE LATE.

03:37.451 --> 03:40.688
- I BELIEVE I'M RIGHT ON TIME,
MICHAEL.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.056
- I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA
HAVE A FACE-TO-FACE.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.426
- DON'T WORRY.
WE WILL.

03:47.828 --> 03:51.465
- GET ME EARS
ON THAT CALL NOW.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.603
- I'M TRYING, SIR, BUT IT LOOKS
LIKE EVERY CALL IN THE STATE

03:55.636 --> 03:57.605
IS BEING ROUTED THROUGH
THAT TOWER, I CAN'T JUST--

03:57.638 --> 04:00.107
- GET THE NSA ON IT, THEN.
GET ME ON THAT CALL!

04:00.140 --> 04:03.110
- LET ME GUESS.
YOU'RE CHANGING THE VENUE.

04:03.143 --> 04:06.480
- THERE'S A CAR WAITING AT
THE CORNER OF COLLINS AND 7TH.

04:06.514 --> 04:08.449
IT LEAVES IN TWO MINUTES.

04:08.482 --> 04:11.785
- WHAT IF I DON'T MAKE IT?
- YOU WILL.

04:11.819 --> 04:13.787
- WESTEN'S MOVING.

04:13.821 --> 04:16.657
KEEP EYES ON HIM
BUT DON'T GET TOO CLOSE.

04:18.826 --> 04:20.494
[engine fires]

04:25.433 --> 04:27.501
- HE'S RUNNING SOUTH ON 5TH.
- ALPHA TEAM ON IT.

04:27.535 --> 04:32.440
- HE JUST CUT ONTO MAIN.
I'VE GOT THIS.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.648
HE'S TAKING THE STAIRS
AT CORAL PLAZA.

04:40.681 --> 04:43.417
- WE'RE CUT OFF.
REROUTING NOW.

04:43.451 --> 04:45.653
- DON'T LOSE HIM!
BRAVO, WHERE ARE YOU?

04:45.686 --> 04:47.688
- HEADING NORTH ON GRANT, SIR.
I DON'T SEE HIM.

04:51.892 --> 04:53.527
- HE JUST CUT OUT OF A GARAGE
ONTO BAYVIEW.

04:53.561 --> 04:56.864
- I'M TWO BLOCKS AWAY, EN ROUTE.
- FIND HIM!

05:02.570 --> 05:05.539
[dramatic electronic music]

05:05.573 --> 05:13.581
*

05:32.600 --> 05:34.802
- WHO'S GOT HIM?

05:34.835 --> 05:37.971
SOMEBODY TELL ME WE HAVE EYES
ON MICHAEL WESTEN.

05:38.005 --> 05:41.208
- WE LOST HIM, SIR.
HE'S GONE.

05:50.884 --> 05:54.221
- FOR A SPY, THE STRAIN
OF A DEEP COVER ASSIGNMENT

05:54.254 --> 05:55.723
GOES BEYOND
JUST BEING ALONE,

05:55.756 --> 05:57.357
SURROUNDED BY ENEMIES
WHO'D KILL YOU

05:57.391 --> 05:59.927
IF THEY KNEW YOUR IDENTITY.

06:04.732 --> 06:07.367
IF YOU WANT TO SURVIVE,

06:07.401 --> 06:09.903
YOU CAN'T LET
ANY OF THAT STRAIN SHOW.

06:09.937 --> 06:13.674
YOU HAVE TO PROJECT
TOTAL CONFIDENCE, TOTAL COMFORT,

06:13.707 --> 06:16.176
AND GREET YOUR ENEMIES
LIKE OLD FRIENDS.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.612
- MICHAEL. WELCOME.
HOW WAS YOUR TRIP?

06:18.646 --> 06:21.582
- CAR, BOAT, HELICOPTER,
CAR AGAIN.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.951
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO THROW
A TRAIN IN FOR GOOD MEASURE?

06:23.984 --> 06:25.185
- IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.854
TALK TO LOGISTICS.
SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.857
- A LOT OF TROUBLE TO GET TO--
WHERE AM I, EXACTLY?

06:29.890 --> 06:31.459
- WHEREVER YOU GO,
THERE YOU ARE.

06:31.492 --> 06:32.693
MICHAEL.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.795
- JAMES, I PASSED
YOUR LITTLE LOYALTY TEST.

06:34.828 --> 06:37.397
WHY DO I GET THE SENSE
YOU STILL DON'T TRUST ME?

06:37.431 --> 06:39.232
- YOU WOULDN'T BE WITHIN
100 MILES OF THIS PLACE

06:39.266 --> 06:40.267
IF I DIDN'T TRUST YOU.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.902
- THEN WHY KEEP ME
IN THE DARK?

06:41.935 --> 06:46.707
- YOU SPENT YOUR WHOLE LIFE
IN THE DARK WORKING FOR THE CIA.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.809
I'M JUST TURNING ON
THE LIGHTS.

06:48.842 --> 06:49.810
COME ON.

06:49.843 --> 06:52.513
LOT TO TALK ABOUT.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.420
- NICE. VERY...CLEAN.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.055
- THAT'S TRUE.

07:02.089 --> 07:05.158
IN MY EXPERIENCE,
ALL YOU NEED TO GET THINGS DONE

07:05.192 --> 07:07.427
IS THE RIGHT PLAN,
RIGHT PEOPLE.

07:07.461 --> 07:09.296
GOOD CUP OF COFFEE
DOESN'T HURT.

07:09.329 --> 07:12.766
NOW, HAVE YOU HAD
THE CHANCE TO RECUPERATE

07:12.800 --> 07:14.234
SINCE OUR LAST MEETING?

07:14.267 --> 07:17.137
- I SLEPT FOR TWO DAYS.

07:17.170 --> 07:20.508
- IT WAS A NECESSARY
UNPLEASANTRY.

07:20.541 --> 07:25.278
I HAD TO UNDERSTAND THE CORE
OF YOU, WHAT MAKES YOU TICK.

07:27.681 --> 07:28.749
DO YOU KNOW WHY
YOU'RE HERE, MICHAEL?

07:28.782 --> 07:31.418
- MY SKILLS, MY TRAINING.
- NO.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.754
WELL, THAT'S PART OF IT,
OF COURSE, BUT NO.

07:33.787 --> 07:38.759
BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU'VE SEEN.
WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.628
YOU STILL HAVE A SOUL.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.295
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

07:42.329 --> 07:44.798
- LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

07:44.832 --> 07:47.300
IN YOUR CAREER,

07:47.334 --> 07:50.971
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU
HAD TO EXECUTE AN ACTION

07:51.004 --> 07:54.441
THAT YOU KNEW WAS MORALLY WRONG
FOR THE MISSION?

07:54.474 --> 07:58.612
YOU MAKE A DEAL WITH SOMEONE
WHO YOU KNOW IS A MONSTER

07:58.646 --> 08:00.848
BECAUSE YOU HAD TO
FOLLOW ORDERS?

08:00.881 --> 08:02.115
- TOO MANY TIMES.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.652
- I WAS THE SAME, ONCE.

08:04.685 --> 08:08.722
THEN ONE DAY
I WAS DONE WITH THAT.

08:08.756 --> 08:13.761
I CAN'T FIGHT AND BLEED FOR MEN
WITHOUT PRINCIPLE ANYMORE.

08:14.928 --> 08:17.798
THAT'S WHY I'VE CREATED
THIS NETWORK...

08:17.831 --> 08:20.067
TO BE THE CONSCIENCE,
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.735
NOW, WHEN WE FIND A MONSTER,

08:21.769 --> 08:24.304
WE DON'T MAKE A DEAL
WITH IT.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.240
WE DESTROY IT.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.042
IS THAT SOMETHING
THAT YOU'D BE INTERESTED IN?

08:29.076 --> 08:32.780
- I WOULDN'T BE WITHIN 100 MILES
OF THIS PLACE IF I WASN'T.

08:35.549 --> 08:37.017
- WELL...

08:40.721 --> 08:42.055
THERE'S YOUR FIRST MONSTER.

08:42.089 --> 08:43.523
MARCO CABRAL.

08:43.557 --> 08:46.393
HE WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE DR,
EDUCATED IN ENGLAND.

08:46.426 --> 08:48.562
CAME BACK HOME
AND GOT HIMSELF A JOB.

08:48.596 --> 08:51.231
- HEAD OF THE DOMINICAN
NARCOTICS POLICE.

08:51.264 --> 08:52.866
- CORRECT.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.902
HE'S ALSO THE DR'S
BIGGEST DRUG SMUGGLER.

08:54.935 --> 08:58.071
HE USED HIS POSITION
TO SLAUGHTER HIS RIVALS,

08:58.105 --> 09:01.875
EXPLOIT THE LESS FORTUNATE,
TAKE OVER.

09:01.909 --> 09:04.177
AND NOW HE'S ARRANGED
A DEAL WITH THE BRITS

09:04.211 --> 09:06.446
IN EXCHANGE FOR HIS
INTELLIGENCE NETWORK.

09:06.479 --> 09:10.584
HE GETS A VERY COMFORTABLE
RETIREMENT IN ENGLAND.

09:10.618 --> 09:12.720
I WANT YOU
TO GET TO HIM FIRST.

09:12.753 --> 09:16.123
I WANT YOU TO BRING HIM TO ME.

09:16.156 --> 09:19.927
THIS OPERATION HAS TO BE
PRECISE, QUIET, UNDER THE RADAR,

09:19.960 --> 09:21.561
SO YOU MAY SELECT ONE PERSON.

09:21.595 --> 09:24.698
ANY RESOURCES YOU NEED
WILL BE PROVIDED.

09:24.732 --> 09:25.933
AND THERE'S ONE LAST THING.

09:25.966 --> 09:28.602
WHEN BURKE FOUND YOU
IN THE DR,

09:28.636 --> 09:30.771
HE WAS WORKING ON THIS.

09:30.804 --> 09:34.074
I THINK HE'D WANT YOU
TO FINISH IT FOR HIM.

09:35.976 --> 09:38.411
SO...

09:40.648 --> 09:43.851
- IT WOULD BE AN HONOR.

09:48.021 --> 09:49.122
- THIS EVERYTHING?

09:49.156 --> 09:51.424
- ORGANIZED BY DATE,
GOING BACK 15 YEARS.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.827
THE PATTERN IS CLEAR.
- GOOD. GOOD WORK.

09:53.861 --> 09:56.664
MAKE SURE I HAVE HARD COPIES
OF THIS FOR THE TRIP.

10:00.367 --> 10:01.301
[beeping]

10:01.334 --> 10:05.005
[cell phone ringing]

10:05.038 --> 10:06.974
- STRONG.
ANY WORD ON MIKE?

10:07.007 --> 10:08.008
- NO, NOTHING YET.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.609
AXE IS ON HIS WAY DOWN
TO JOIN HIM NOW.

10:09.643 --> 10:11.178
THEY'RE DOING
SOME KIND OF JOB FOR JAMES,

10:11.211 --> 10:13.346
BUT THAT'S ALL WE KNOW.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.082
- SO, WHAT, WE'RE JUST
SITTING ON OUR HANDS?

10:15.115 --> 10:17.284
- NO, PORTER, ACTUALLY
WE'VE BEEN QUITE BUSY

10:17.317 --> 10:18.819
GOING OVER
THE FINANCIAL RECORDS

10:18.852 --> 10:21.121
THAT FIONA AND MICHAEL
STOLE A FEW WEEKS AGO.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.356
AND WE HAVE A NEW LEAD.
- OKAY. WHAT IS IT?

10:23.390 --> 10:25.659
- IT'S NOT WHAT, IT'S WHO.

10:25.693 --> 10:28.328
LOOKS LIKE JAMES
HAS A FRIEND IN BILOXI.

10:28.361 --> 10:31.031
A MENTAL PATIENT. HE'S BEEN
PAYING HIS BILLS FOR YEARS.

10:31.064 --> 10:33.466
- REALLY? WHY? WHAT'S--
WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT THE GUY?

10:33.500 --> 10:34.768
- WELL, THAT'S WHAT
YOU AND GLENANNE

10:34.802 --> 10:36.136
ARE GONNA HELP ME FIND OUT.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.171
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW
IF FI'S GONNA BE DOWN

10:38.205 --> 10:40.440
FOR A LAST-MINUTE
CIA EXCURSION.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.309
- I DON'T REALLY CARE
WHAT SHE'S DOWN FOR, PORTER.

10:42.342 --> 10:43.944
BOTH OF YOU ARE GETTING
YOUR BUTTS ON THAT PLANE.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.113
WHEELS UP IN FOUR HOURS,
AND I WILL SEE YOU THERE.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.380
- OKAY, FINE.

10:47.414 --> 10:50.150
SINCE YOU ASKED SO NICELY,
I'LL TALK TO HER.

11:00.928 --> 11:02.495
- YOU SURE YOU HAVE TO
MEET MADDIE RIGHT NOW?

11:02.529 --> 11:04.064
YOU CAN'T JUST CALL HER,
SAY YOU CAN'T MAKE IT?

11:04.097 --> 11:06.233
- [sighs] SHE WAS UPSET,
IT SOUNDED URGENT.

11:06.266 --> 11:07.534
- YEAH, I GET IT, I GET IT,

11:07.567 --> 11:09.737
BUT WE GOT A CIA PLANE
WAITING FOR US RIGHT NOW.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.338
IF WE'RE LATE
STRONG IS GONNA BE PISSED.

11:11.371 --> 11:12.906
- I'M MORE WORRIED
ABOUT WHAT MADELINE WESTEN

11:12.940 --> 11:14.407
WILL DO IF I BLOW HER OFF.

11:14.441 --> 11:19.212
- FAIR ENOUGH.
JUST BE QUICK, PLEASE.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.414
- AWW...

11:21.448 --> 11:23.316
- HEY, CHARLIE.

11:23.350 --> 11:26.319
- SAY HI TO AUNT FIONA.
- HI, AUNT FIONA.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.756
- DRAW GRANDMA A CIGARETTE.
THAT'LL BE NICE, HONEY.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.557
- I HAVE TO PICK THIS.

11:30.590 --> 11:33.894
- OKAY. I'M GONNA GO
TALK TO AUNT FIONA, ALL RIGHT?

11:33.927 --> 11:35.562
- OKAY.
- I'M KEEPING AN EYE ON YOU.

11:35.595 --> 11:37.164
- WHAT'S UP?
I HAVE A PRETTY BUSY DAY.

11:37.197 --> 11:40.667
- YEAH, I KNOW.
UM, ACTUALLY...

11:40.700 --> 11:42.936
THAT'S WHAT I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

11:42.970 --> 11:45.939
YOUR BUSY DAY.

11:45.973 --> 11:48.241
[sighs]

11:48.275 --> 11:49.910
I GOT A CALL
FROM YOUR BOYFRIEND

11:49.943 --> 11:52.245
ABOUT YOUR BUSY DAY.

11:52.279 --> 11:53.914
- CARLOS CALLED YOU?
- YES.

11:53.947 --> 11:57.250
I KNOW, THIS IS BEYOND AWKWARD,
COMING FROM ME.

11:57.284 --> 12:00.420
BUT HE'S WORRIED, AND HE KNOWS
YOU AND I ARE FRIENDS,

12:00.453 --> 12:02.289
AND I'M THE ONLY PERSON
HE HAD TO TALK TO.

12:02.322 --> 12:05.292
HE SAYS YOU'RE
GOING OUT OF TOWN.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.895
- WELL, YEAH.
I TOLD HIM ALL ABOUT IT.

12:07.928 --> 12:10.397
JESSE AND I ARE JUST
GOING TO MISSISSIPPI.

12:10.430 --> 12:11.932
BUSINESS TRIP.

12:11.965 --> 12:14.434
- I'VE BEEN AROUND LONG ENOUGH
TO KNOW YOU'RE LYING TO HIM.

12:14.467 --> 12:17.404
AND HE KNOWS IT TOO.

12:17.437 --> 12:20.407
SO WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON?

12:20.440 --> 12:23.443
- IT'S ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION
MICHAEL'S WORKING TO TAKE DOWN.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.712
IT'S CLASSIFIED.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.782
- AS MICHAEL'S MOTHER,
I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU

12:28.816 --> 12:32.552
FOR HELPING HIM
BRING THEM DOWN.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.788
BUT I'M YOUR FRIEND TOO,
FIONA.

12:34.822 --> 12:37.991
AND YOU KEEP DOING THIS,
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE THAT

12:38.025 --> 12:41.128
YOUNG MAN OF YOURS WHO I THINK
YOU CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.135
- I KNOW.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.973
[sighs]

12:53.006 --> 12:56.743
IF I DO THIS, I RISK LOSING HIM,
AND IF I DON'T...

12:56.776 --> 13:00.814
AND THE MISSION FAILS, AND WE
GO TO PRISON, I LOSE HIM ANYWAY.

13:05.118 --> 13:09.022
- THEN I SUGGEST
YOU GET ON WITH YOUR DAY.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.540
- ANYBODY HOME?

13:27.574 --> 13:28.541
- HEY, SAM.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.377
- BEFORE YOU SAY
ANOTHER WORD, MIKE,

13:30.410 --> 13:33.313
THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT I GOTTA SAY.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.282
I'M NOT SURE
IF I WANT IN ON THIS OP.

13:35.315 --> 13:39.052
SCREWING UP AN EXTRADITION DEAL
RUN BY THE MI6,

13:39.086 --> 13:42.055
AS IN THE SECURITY SERVICE
OF OUR CLOSEST ALLY?

13:42.089 --> 13:46.393
- THEY'RE GIVING A DRUG SMUGGLER
A COMFORTABLE RETIREMENT.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.328
YOU READ THE FILE, SAM.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.964
CABRAL HAS KILLED
ENTIRE FAMILIES.

13:50.998 --> 13:53.633
THEY MAY BE OUR ALLY, BUT I'M
NOT GONNA LOSE SLEEP OVER THIS.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.835
- OKAY, BUT YOU DO REMEMBER
WHAT THE JOB IS, RIGHT?

13:55.869 --> 13:57.370
WHY WE'RE HERE?

13:57.404 --> 13:59.072
'CAUSE IT AIN'T
TO TAKE DOWN MARCO CABRAL.

13:59.106 --> 14:03.410
- JAMES IS THE TARGET, CABRAL
IS JUST A MEANS TO AN END.

14:04.777 --> 14:06.746
- SO WE'RE CLEAR ON THAT.
- WE'RE CLEAR.

14:06.779 --> 14:10.083
- SO WHAT'S THE PLAN?

14:10.117 --> 14:13.153
- CABRAL IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE
HIS FINAL SIT-DOWN WITH MI6

14:13.186 --> 14:15.088
AT A RESTAURANT
IN HIS HOTEL.

14:15.122 --> 14:17.057
- WELL, CAN WE
TAKE HIM THERE?

14:17.090 --> 14:18.558
- THAT'S THE IDEA, SAM.

14:18.591 --> 14:21.995
THE CHALLENGE IS THAT JAMES
WANTS THIS DONE QUIETLY

14:22.029 --> 14:23.230
AND WE WON'T HAVE A TEAM.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.665
- SO A DIRECT GRAB
IS OUT, THEN.

14:25.698 --> 14:29.069
- OUR BEST BET IS TO BEAT MI6
TO THE PUNCH

14:29.102 --> 14:30.570
AND OFFER CABRAL
A BETTER DEAL.

14:30.603 --> 14:31.771
- YOU SURE
THAT'S GONNA FLY?

14:31.804 --> 14:33.240
'CAUSE HE'S BEEN
TALKING TO OUR FRIENDS

14:33.273 --> 14:34.908
ACROSS THE DITCH
FOR A YEAR.

14:34.942 --> 14:37.044
WHY WOULD
HE JUMP SHIP NOW--

14:37.077 --> 14:38.578
WELL, THAT'S A START.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.180
- WE'LL DELAY
THE BRITISH TEAM

14:40.213 --> 14:42.082
WITH A FAKE BOMB THREAT
AT THE EMBASSY.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.383
- YOU'LL GO IN,
MAKE THE OFFER,

14:43.416 --> 14:44.417
AND I'LL COVER YOU
FROM THE STREET.

14:44.451 --> 14:47.087
- OKAY,
AND YOU'LL COVER ME WITH...

14:52.125 --> 14:53.426
- ANYTHING YOU WANT.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.063
- [whistles]
THAT'S A LOT OF GUNS, MIKEY.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.133
- WHEN OPERATING
IN THIRD-WORLD COUNTRIES,

15:00.167 --> 15:03.070
A DOLLAR IS USUALLY A LOT MORE
USEFUL THAN A BULLET.

15:03.103 --> 15:07.440
IN A PLACE WHERE THE GOVERNMENT
RUNS ON BRIBES AND CONNECTIONS,

15:07.474 --> 15:11.244
YOU CAN GET A LOT DONE WITH
A NICE SUIT AND A BAG OF CASH.

15:11.278 --> 15:12.745
- OKAY, MIKE, I'M IN PLACE.

15:12.779 --> 15:14.814
ANY SIGN OF HER MAJESTY'S
SECRET SERVICE?

15:14.847 --> 15:18.418
- NO. MI6 HAS NOT
APPROACHED THE HOTEL.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.420
THE LOCKDOWN AT THE BRITISH
EMBASSY IS WORKING.

15:20.453 --> 15:21.921
- GOOD, IT SOUNDS LIKE OUR

15:21.955 --> 15:25.092
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE
DID ITS TRICK.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.094
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,
I'M LETTING YOUR SPY FRIENDS

15:27.127 --> 15:28.661
BUY ME THE GOOD CHAMPAGNE.

15:28.695 --> 15:32.099
YOU KNOW, JUST TO HELP
SELL THE COVER I.D.

15:32.132 --> 15:35.502
- KNOCK YOURSELF OUT, SAM.

15:35.535 --> 15:36.736
- LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.405
CABRAL IS RIGHT ON TIME.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.573
YOU GOT ME COVERED?
- YEAH, SAM.

15:40.607 --> 15:41.975
I GOT A VIEW
OF THE ENTIRE COURTYARD.

15:42.009 --> 15:43.977
- SENOR CABRAL.

15:44.011 --> 15:46.746
WELCOME.

15:46.779 --> 15:47.947
ENCANTADO DE CONOCERTE,

15:47.981 --> 15:49.249
AS I BELIEVE
YOUR COUNTRYMEN SAY.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.951
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:51.985 --> 15:52.952
WHERE ARE THE BRITISH--

15:52.986 --> 15:54.954
- OH, YOUR BRITISH FRIENDS.

15:54.988 --> 15:56.823
WELL, THEY'VE BEEN,
UM, DELAYED.

15:56.856 --> 16:00.693
I WAS HOPING WE'D HAVE A LITTLE
CHAT BEFORE THEY GOT HERE.

16:00.727 --> 16:03.596
- LLAMA BARTON.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.265
WHO ARE YOU?
AND HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT--

16:05.298 --> 16:07.000
- ABOUT YOUR ARRANGEMENT
WITH MI6?

16:07.034 --> 16:08.535
[chuckles]
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY

16:08.568 --> 16:10.770
I MAKE IT MY BUSINESS
TO KNOW SUCH THINGS.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.539
I'LL GET RIGHT TO THE POINT.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.107
MY NAME IS CHARLES FINLEY
AND I REPRESENT

16:14.141 --> 16:16.209
A MAJOR CONGLOMERATE
WITH INTEREST IN THE CARIBBEAN.

16:16.243 --> 16:18.678
WE WERE TOLD THAT YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR A FRESH START,

16:18.711 --> 16:19.779
SO WE'D LIKE
TO MAKE AN OFFER.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.815
- MOMENTO.

16:22.849 --> 16:25.185
AN OFFER, YOU SAY.
- YES, A VERY GENEROUS OFFER.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.154
STOCK OPTIONS,
COMPANY HOUSING,

16:27.187 --> 16:30.523
A SEVEN-FIGURE RETAINER PER
YEAR, AND THAT'S JUST TO START.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.125
- INTERESTING.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.861
TELL ME SOMETHING,
MR. FINLEY.

16:34.894 --> 16:39.232
WHAT DOES A CONSORTIUM LIKE
YOURS WANT WITH A MAN LIKE ME?

16:39.266 --> 16:41.334
- WELL, WE'RE MOVING
INTO THIS REGION

16:41.368 --> 16:44.737
AND WE NEED SOMEONE
WITH INFLUENCE, CONNECTIONS.

16:44.771 --> 16:47.474
SOMEONE WHO ISN'T AFRAID TO,
AS THEY SAY,

16:47.507 --> 16:49.176
GET THEIR HANDS
A LITTLE BLOODY.

16:49.209 --> 16:52.579
- I'VE FOUND THAT BLOOD
ALWAYS WASHES RIGHT OFF.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.047
- [chuckles]
SEE?

16:54.081 --> 16:56.249
NOW, THAT'S THE POSITIVE
ATTITUDE WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

16:56.283 --> 16:59.252
- YOU MAKE BIG PROMISES,
MR. FINLEY.

16:59.286 --> 17:03.590
TELL ME WHY I SHOULD
BELIEVE A WORD YOU SAY.

17:03.623 --> 17:06.226
- HOW ABOUT A MILLION REASONS?

17:06.259 --> 17:09.028
- AND THAT'S JUST
THE SIGNING BONUS.

17:09.062 --> 17:13.100
THAT'S YOURS RIGHT NOW IF YOU
GO WITH US INSTEAD OF MI6.

17:13.133 --> 17:17.070
- THAT IS VERY TEMPTING.

17:17.104 --> 17:19.406
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT'S MORE TEMPTING?

17:19.439 --> 17:22.275
I TAKE YOUR MONEY...

17:22.309 --> 17:24.411
AND I GO WITH MI6.

17:24.444 --> 17:28.081
REMEMBER, MR. FINLEY, I'M NOT
AFRAID TO GET MY HANDS BLOODY.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.250
- OH, I WOULDN'T DO THAT
IF I WERE YOU, SENOR CABRAL.

17:30.283 --> 17:33.253
- OH, NO?
AND WHY NOT?

17:33.286 --> 17:35.288
[glass shatters]

17:35.322 --> 17:36.923
[men chattering]

17:36.956 --> 17:38.858
- YOU SEE,
YOU COULD KILL ME,

17:38.891 --> 17:41.261
BUT THEN MY SNIPER
WOULD HAVE TO KILL YOU.

17:41.294 --> 17:42.895
AND THAT SOUNDS
LIKE A BAD START

17:42.929 --> 17:44.531
TO A GREAT
BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP.

17:44.564 --> 17:47.134
WELL, YOU'VE GOT MY NUMBER.

17:47.167 --> 17:50.270
WHEN YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND,
YOU GIVE ME A CALL.

17:57.944 --> 18:01.047
- MIKE, I DON'T KNOW
HOW MANY TIMES I GOTTA SAY THIS,

18:01.080 --> 18:03.450
BUT THIS MISSION IS A BUST.

18:03.483 --> 18:04.884
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU WERE PAYING ATTENTION,

18:04.917 --> 18:06.619
BUT I WAS DOWN THERE
WITH A BUNCH OF GUNS IN MY FACE,

18:06.653 --> 18:09.756
AND CABRAL WAS VERY CLEAR,
HE'S STICKING WITH MI6.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.291
- WE CAN'T JUST
GIVE UP, SAM.

18:11.324 --> 18:12.792
- THIS ISN'T
ABOUT GIVING UP, BROTHER,

18:12.825 --> 18:14.427
THIS IS ABOUT
FACING REALITY.

18:14.461 --> 18:15.828
THIS GUY'S GONNA BE
ON A BOAT

18:15.862 --> 18:17.930
BACK TO JOLLY OLD ENGLAND IN,
WHAT, EIGHT HOURS?

18:17.964 --> 18:20.600
- WHICH MEANS WE HAVE
EIGHT HOURS TO CHANGE HIS MIND.

18:20.633 --> 18:23.903
- HOW DO YOU PROPOSE
TO DO THAT?

18:23.936 --> 18:27.274
- LISTEN, SAM, THERE'S A REASON
WHY HE TOOK THIS DEAL.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.609
CABRAL HAS ENEMIES.

18:29.642 --> 18:32.679
HE'S ALREADY SURVIVED
TWO ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.647
WE CAN USE THAT.
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

18:34.681 --> 18:38.151
- WELL, WE KNOW THE MARINA
WHERE HE'S MEETING WITH MI6.

18:38.185 --> 18:40.920
IF WE CAN CONVINCE HIM
THE BRITISH CAN'T PROTECT HIM,

18:40.953 --> 18:43.623
OUR PLAN WILL BE
HIS ONLY OPTION.

18:43.656 --> 18:46.293
- MIKE, I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH
COOL CRAP THOSE GUYS GOT YOU,

18:46.326 --> 18:48.361
WE ARE NOT ATTACKING
TWO FULLY-EQUIPPED TEAMS.

18:48.395 --> 18:50.297
- NO ATTACK.
SABOTAGE.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.798
SABOTAGE THE BRITISH BOAT,

18:51.831 --> 18:53.533
MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
HIS POLITICAL ENEMIES DID IT.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.668
- I GOT A WORD FOR THAT:
NIGHTMARE.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.504
- IT'S EITHER THAT
OR FAILURE.

18:57.537 --> 19:01.140
AND YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO
THIS CAN'T FAIL.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.844
[dramatic music]

19:04.877 --> 19:07.380
[siren wails]

19:07.414 --> 19:09.449
- WELCOME TO BILOXI.
HOPE YOU ENJOYED THE FLIGHT.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.883
- YEAH, NOT SO MUCH.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.819
ALL YOUR SECRET BUDGETS, YOU
CAN'T SPRING FOR A BIGGER PLANE?

19:12.852 --> 19:15.288
I'VE BEEN IN BUMPER CARS WITH
MORE LEGROOM THAN THAT THING.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.957
- I'LL BRING IT UP
WITH CONGRESS.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.392
HERE'S THE SITUATION.

19:19.426 --> 19:20.893
OFFICIALLY,
OUR PERSON OF INTEREST

19:20.927 --> 19:23.563
WAS TRANSFERRED HERE
FOR AN OUTPATIENT PROCEDURE.

19:23.596 --> 19:26.566
WE'LL DO THE INTERROGATION
IN ONE OF THE SURGERY ROOMS,

19:26.599 --> 19:28.067
SHIP HIM BACK.

19:28.100 --> 19:29.068
- DO WE HAVE A NAME?

19:29.101 --> 19:30.370
- YOU HAVE ABOUT 50.

19:30.403 --> 19:31.904
EVERY TIME HE GOT MOVED
TO ANOTHER INSTITUTE

19:31.938 --> 19:35.041
FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE
HE GOT A NEW FILE AND A NEW I.D.

19:35.074 --> 19:37.877
FOR NOW, HE'S JOHN DOE.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.546
- I'M NOT LIKING
THE "CRIMINALLY INSANE" THING.

19:39.579 --> 19:40.680
IS HE DANGEROUS?

19:40.713 --> 19:42.982
- WELL, WE HAVE TO
ASSUME HE IS.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.318
HE'S BEEN IN ISOLATION
ON A DOUBLE DOSE OF HALDOL

19:45.352 --> 19:47.654
SINCE AS FAR BACK
AS THE RECORDS GO.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.423
WE'VE BEEN STEPPING HIM DOWN
OFF THE DRUG SINCE THIS MORNING.

19:50.457 --> 19:52.024
- YOU SURE THAT'S
A GOOD IDEA?

19:52.058 --> 19:54.661
THIS GUY'S GOT
A SPECIAL FORCES TATTOO.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.162
I PREFER MY TRAINED KILLERS
ON THE SLEEPY SIDE.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.064
- YEAH,
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

19:58.097 --> 20:00.099
WE NEED HIM COGENT
AND ANSWERING QUESTIONS.

20:00.132 --> 20:01.668
I'LL LEAD THE INTERROGATION,

20:01.701 --> 20:03.236
BUT I WANT YOU TWO
BACKING ME UP.

20:03.270 --> 20:05.905
FILLING IN ANY BLANKS
WITH WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT JAMES.

20:05.938 --> 20:07.440
[alarm sounds]

20:07.474 --> 20:09.442
- [on PA]
CODE GRAY, CODE GRAY.

20:09.476 --> 20:12.679
SECURITY TO WEST WING
NURSE'S STATION. CODE GRAY.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.881
- CAT SCAN RIGHT AWAY
AND GET HIM TO RADIOLOGY.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.749
- WHAT HAPPENED?
WHERE'S JOHN DOE?

20:16.783 --> 20:18.084
- WE WERE ESCORTING HIM
TO THE HOLDING ROOM,

20:18.117 --> 20:21.053
AND SOMEHOW HE GOT OUT
OF HIS RESTRAINTS.

20:22.822 --> 20:25.392
- WE HAVE TO FIND HIM NOW.

20:25.425 --> 20:27.026
IF HE GETS
OUT OF THIS HOSPITAL...

20:27.059 --> 20:28.361
- YOU NEED TO LOCK
THIS PLACE DOWN.

20:28.395 --> 20:31.598
- THE CIA IS NOT
OFFICIALLY HERE.

20:31.631 --> 20:34.767
WE ORDER A LOCKDOWN, WE COULD
EXPOSE THE ENTIRE OPERATION.

20:34.801 --> 20:36.603
- WE'RE NOT GONNA CATCH
A SPECIAL FORCES OPERATIVE

20:36.636 --> 20:38.538
WITH HOSPITAL SECURITY.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.206
- QUARANTINE.
- WHAT?

20:40.239 --> 20:42.275
- CONTACT THE CDC,
TELL THEM THERE'S A--

20:42.309 --> 20:43.476
AN ANTHRAX OUTBREAK.

20:43.510 --> 20:46.613
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO LOCK THIS PLACE DOWN.

20:46.646 --> 20:48.214
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL MAKE THE CALL.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.382
YOU TWO ALERT SECURITY.

20:49.416 --> 20:50.950
[dials]

20:50.983 --> 20:54.754
[sighs]

20:58.791 --> 21:01.227
- IF YOU NEED
TO SABOTAGE A BOAT,

21:01.260 --> 21:03.430
AN EXPLOSIVE CHARGE
UNDERNEATH THE WATER LINE

21:03.463 --> 21:05.765
IS USUALLY THE MOST
EFFICIENT WAY TO DO IT.

21:05.798 --> 21:07.066
THE CHALLENGE IS THAT

21:07.099 --> 21:10.403
NORMAL EXPLOSIVE DEVICES
AND SALT WATER DON'T MIX.

21:10.437 --> 21:12.805
REMOTE DETONATORS
WON'T TRANSMIT UNDERWATER,

21:12.839 --> 21:14.341
SO YOU NEED TO USE A TIMER.
[beeps]

21:14.374 --> 21:16.676
THE COMPONENTS CAN'T GET WET,
SO YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE

21:16.709 --> 21:18.678
THE DEVICE
HAS A WATERPROOF SEAL.

21:18.711 --> 21:21.113
AND ONCE YOU'RE DONE
COMES THE REALLY HARD PART--

21:21.147 --> 21:24.116
PUTTING THE DEVICE
WHERE YOU NEED IT.

21:24.150 --> 21:25.685
HOW WE LOOKING, SAM?

21:25.718 --> 21:28.187
- WELL, THE MI6 GUYS
ARE STILL SWEEPING THE BOAT.

21:28.220 --> 21:31.023
LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE
ALMOST DONE.

21:31.057 --> 21:32.258
YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO DO THIS, MIKE?

21:32.291 --> 21:34.327
ONLY GOT ABOUT TEN MINUTES
BEFORE CABRAL SHOWS.

21:34.361 --> 21:36.363
- WE HAVE TO, SAM.
IT'S OUR LAST SHOT.

21:36.396 --> 21:39.366
[suspenseful music]

21:39.399 --> 21:47.474
*

22:01.721 --> 22:04.323
- SENOR CABRAL.
YOU'RE EARLY.

22:04.357 --> 22:05.558
- EVERYTHING IN ORDER?

22:05.592 --> 22:07.026
- JUST AS WE DISCUSSED, YES.

22:07.059 --> 22:09.662
THE BOAT WILL TAKE YOU
TO THE CAYMAN ISLANDS,

22:09.696 --> 22:12.131
AND FROM THERE YOU'LL GO
BY PRIVATE PLANE TO LONDON.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.801
- GOOD.
CHECK THE BOAT.

22:14.834 --> 22:17.003
- THERE'S NO NEED FOR THAT,
SENOR CABRAL.

22:17.036 --> 22:19.305
MY MEN HAVE ALREADY
CHECKED EVERYTHING.

22:19.338 --> 22:22.375
- SENOR BARTON, A DISSIDENT
PUT A BOMB IN MY HOME

22:22.409 --> 22:25.011
JUST A MONTH AGO.

22:25.044 --> 22:26.345
ANOTHER TRIED
TO ASSASSINATE ME

22:26.379 --> 22:28.415
IN THE MARKETPLACE
JUST A FEW DAYS AGO.

22:28.448 --> 22:31.551
EVERY SECOND I AM ON THIS ISLAND
MY LIFE IS IN DANGER.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.085
- WHICH IS
ALL THE MORE REASON

22:33.119 --> 22:34.887
WHY YOU SHOULD
DEPART IMMEDIATELY.

22:34.921 --> 22:38.190
- I WILL.
AFTER MY MEN HAVE CHECKED IT.

22:38.224 --> 22:40.460
GO.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.230
- HOW AM I LOOKING, SAM?

22:44.263 --> 22:45.665
- MIKE, WE GOT A PROBLEM.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.667
CABRAL'S EARLY,
AND HE'S SENDING HIS GUYS

22:47.700 --> 22:49.068
TO THE BOAT--
TIME TO ABORT.

22:49.101 --> 22:51.871
- IF WE LOSE CABRAL,
WE LOSE JAMES.

22:51.904 --> 22:53.372
- MIKE, PULL THE PLUG
AND GET OUTTA THERE.

22:53.406 --> 22:54.707
- I COULD STILL DO THIS.

22:54.741 --> 22:56.242
- YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S CRAZY TALK.

22:56.275 --> 22:57.744
YOU WON'T HAVE TIME
TO PLANT A BOMB

22:57.777 --> 22:59.412
AND GET A SAFE
DISTANCE AWAY.

22:59.446 --> 23:00.913
- AN UNDERWATER EXPLOSION

23:00.947 --> 23:02.882
ISN'T SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO BE CLOSE TO,

23:02.915 --> 23:04.851
'CAUSE WATER DOESN'T
COMPRESS UNDER PRESSURE.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.052
[beeps]

23:06.085 --> 23:07.554
A SHOCKWAVE CARRIES
A LONG DISTANCE

23:07.587 --> 23:10.222
WITHOUT LOSING KINETIC ENERGY.

23:10.256 --> 23:11.624
AND IF YOU'RE STILL
WITHIN THE BLAST RADIUS

23:11.658 --> 23:12.892
WHEN THE BOMB GOES OFF,

23:12.925 --> 23:15.462
THAT KINETIC ENERGY WILL SHATTER
EVERY BONE IN YOUR BODY.

23:22.602 --> 23:24.036
- YOUR MEN CHECKED THE BOAT?

23:24.070 --> 23:25.204
- MIKE, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

23:25.237 --> 23:26.372
- YOU CALL THAT CLEAR?

23:26.405 --> 23:28.040
- IT WAS CLEAR
NOT TEN MINUTES AGO!

23:28.074 --> 23:29.075
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

23:29.108 --> 23:30.710
SENOR CABRAL,
UNEXPECTED COMPLICATIONS

23:30.743 --> 23:31.744
ARE PART OF ANY MISSION.

23:31.778 --> 23:32.745
MY MEN ARE CURRENTLY
IMPLEMENTING--

23:32.779 --> 23:34.413
- YOUR MEN
ALMOST GOT ME KILLED.

23:34.447 --> 23:36.048
- WE WILL MAKE
OTHER ARRANGEMENTS.

23:36.082 --> 23:39.552
- NO! THERE WILL BE
NO MORE ARRANGEMENTS. VAMANOS.

23:39.586 --> 23:42.121
[tires squeal]

23:52.298 --> 23:54.033
- MIKE.

23:57.169 --> 23:58.571
MIKE, WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT?

23:58.605 --> 23:59.606
- DID IT WORK?

23:59.639 --> 24:00.840
- SETTING OFF A CHARGE
SO CLOSE TO YOU,

24:00.873 --> 24:01.941
YOU COULD'VE
KILLED YOURSELF.

24:01.974 --> 24:04.276
- DID IT WORK?

24:04.310 --> 24:06.946
- YEAH, MIKE.
IT WORKED.

24:12.652 --> 24:15.454
- WELL, YOU'RE LUCKY
THAT'S THE WORST OF IT.

24:15.488 --> 24:18.124
I STILL THINK WE SHOULD CHECK
YOU OUT FOR A CONCUSSION TOO.

24:18.157 --> 24:21.327
- THE BLAST PUSHED ME
INTO SOME ROCKS. I'M FINE.

24:21.360 --> 24:23.295
- BARELY.
- GOT THE JOB DONE.

24:23.329 --> 24:24.664
- MAYBE.

24:24.697 --> 24:27.166
THERE'S STILL NO GUARANTEE
THAT CABRAL IS GONNA CALL.

24:27.199 --> 24:31.037
MEANWHILE, YOU'RE OUT THERE
RISKING YOUR LIFE, AND FOR WHAT?

24:31.070 --> 24:32.672
- YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S FOR.
THE CIA.

24:32.705 --> 24:34.507
- YEAH, YEAH, THEY'RE GONNA
THROW US IN A HOLE

24:34.541 --> 24:35.608
IF WE DON'T HELP 'EM
GET THIS JAMES GUY,

24:35.642 --> 24:37.043
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:37.076 --> 24:39.979
LIFE IN A CIA PRISON IS STILL
BETTER THAN DEATH FACE-DOWN

24:40.012 --> 24:42.348
IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOME GOD-FORSAKEN MARINA

24:42.381 --> 24:43.449
ON SOME COCKAMAMIE
MISSION THAT--

24:43.482 --> 24:45.818
[cell phone rings]

24:45.852 --> 24:47.554
DON'T GET SMUG.

24:47.587 --> 24:49.221
[beeps]

24:49.255 --> 24:50.289
FINLEY HERE.

24:50.322 --> 24:53.793
- SENOR FINLEY,
THIS IS MARCO CABRAL.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.528
- HOW NICE TO HEAR FROM YOU,
MR. CABRAL.

24:55.562 --> 24:57.063
HOW ARE YOU
THIS LOVELY AFTERNOON?

24:57.096 --> 24:59.498
- CIRCUMSTANCES
HAVE CHANGED.

24:59.532 --> 25:01.968
YOUR OFFER--
IS IT STILL ON THE TABLE?

25:02.001 --> 25:03.570
- WHY, YES IT IS, INDEED.

25:03.603 --> 25:06.072
JUST TELL ME WHERE
YOU'D LIKE TO MEET.

25:11.944 --> 25:15.047
- ABSOLUTELY.
AS SOON AS WE CAN.

25:15.081 --> 25:16.182
BOUGHT US ONE MORE HOUR
OF OUR QUARANTINE,

25:16.215 --> 25:17.917
BUT WE GOTTA WRAP THIS UP FAST.
WHAT DO WE HAVE?

25:17.950 --> 25:19.819
- WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS
HE HASN'T LEFT THE BUILDING.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.253
WE HAVE CAMERAS
AT EVERY EXIT,

25:21.287 --> 25:23.355
AND NOTHING'S COME IN OR OUT
SINCE THE LOCKDOWN.

25:23.389 --> 25:24.591
- HAVE WE SWEPT
ALL THE FLOORS YET?

25:24.624 --> 25:26.158
- WELL, THAT'S THE BAD NEWS.

25:26.192 --> 25:27.994
SECURITY'S COMBED EVERY INCH,
AND THERE'S NO SIGN OF HIM.

25:28.027 --> 25:30.563
- WHAT, HE JUST DISAPPEARED?
I MEAN, WHERE DID HE GO?

25:30.597 --> 25:33.032
- HOLD ON, GUYS,
CHECK THIS OUT.

25:33.065 --> 25:35.267
THIRD FLOOR SECURITY CORRIDOR
CAMERA PICKS HIM UP

25:35.301 --> 25:39.505
GOING ALL THE WAY
DOWN THE HALL.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.674
AND THEN POOF.
KILLS THE FEED.

25:41.708 --> 25:43.943
- THE ONLY PLACE HE COULD'VE
GONE FROM THERE IS THE ROOF.

25:43.976 --> 25:46.345
PULL NELSON AND JACOBS OFF E.R.
- HANG ON, HANG ON.

25:46.378 --> 25:47.546
IF THIS GUY'S
HIDING ON THE ROOF,

25:47.580 --> 25:48.781
WHY WOULD HE WAIT
UNTIL HE GOT

25:48.815 --> 25:50.349
ALL THE WAY TO THE ACCESS DOOR
TO KILL THE CAMERA?

25:50.382 --> 25:52.184
- HE'S BEEN SEDATED.
HE'S NOT THINKING STRAIGHT.

25:52.218 --> 25:53.786
- OR HE WANTS US
TO THINK HE'S UP THERE.

25:53.820 --> 25:55.421
THIS GUY
WITH SPECIAL FORCES,

25:55.454 --> 25:56.856
HE KNOWS HOW MANY PEOPLE
WE'VE GOT.

25:56.889 --> 25:59.025
WE START PULLING PEOPLE
OFF OF EXITS,

25:59.058 --> 26:00.760
WE MIGHT BE GIVING HIM
EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS.

26:00.793 --> 26:01.861
- BUT YOU KNOW,
LAST TIME I CHECKED,

26:01.894 --> 26:04.030
EVEN DELTAS
CAN'T TURN INVISIBLE.

26:04.063 --> 26:06.198
HE'S GOTTA BE ON THE ROOF.
WE'VE CLEARED THE BUILDING.

26:06.232 --> 26:07.600
THERE'S NO PLACE ELSE
FOR HIM TO GO.

26:07.634 --> 26:10.637
- WHAT ABOUT
THE ELEVATOR SHAFT?

26:10.670 --> 26:15.708
IT'S RIGHT WHERE
THE CAMERA WENT DOWN.

26:15.742 --> 26:18.911
- SON OF A BITCH.

26:23.482 --> 26:25.251
- OKAY...
WE'RE APPROACHING

26:25.284 --> 26:27.620
THE ELEVATOR DOORS
IN THE BASEMENT.

26:27.654 --> 26:29.722
WHICH IS ALSO THE MORGUE,
BY THE WAY--THANKS FOR THAT.

26:29.756 --> 26:31.924
- ANYTIME, PORTER.

26:31.958 --> 26:33.760
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE,
LET'S LOOK ALIVE.

26:33.793 --> 26:35.628
GOTTA OPEN THESE DOORS
AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME.

26:35.662 --> 26:38.931
I DON'T WANT THIS GUY
GETTING AWAY.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.108
- ALL RIGHT, WE'RE READY.

26:49.141 --> 26:50.843
LET'S GET THIS DONE,
GENTLEMEN.

26:50.877 --> 26:54.446
- ONE, TWO, THREE.

27:04.857 --> 27:06.859
FIRST FLOOR, ALL CLEAR.

27:06.893 --> 27:09.829
- SECOND FLOOR, CLEAR.

27:11.898 --> 27:14.066
- [whispers]
I THINK I GOT SOMETHING.

27:18.838 --> 27:20.973
AH, IT'S A FALSE ALARM.
IT'S NOT HIM.

27:21.007 --> 27:24.777
- HEY, PORTER, I'M LIKING
MY ROOF IDEA MORE AND MORE.

27:24.811 --> 27:26.112
- I'M TELLING YOU,
HE'S STILL IN THE BUILDING, MAN.

27:26.145 --> 27:27.980
[thud]

27:29.581 --> 27:31.050
UHH!

27:31.083 --> 27:33.652
- JESSE. JESSE?

27:39.191 --> 27:40.392
- HOW'S IT LOOKING OUT THERE?

27:40.426 --> 27:42.128
- NO SIGN OF SURVEILLANCE.
WE'RE ALL SET.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.663
CABRAL SAID 2:00?
- YEAH.

27:44.697 --> 27:46.565
UH, THE NORTH
PARKING STRUCTURE, 2:00.

27:46.598 --> 27:47.967
SO I'VE BEEN CHECKING OUT

27:48.000 --> 27:50.803
THIS KIDNAP KIT THEY
PUT TOGETHER FOR US--NOT BAD.

27:50.837 --> 27:52.204
I'M THINKING WE WAIT
TILL WE GET OUT OF THE CITY

27:52.238 --> 27:53.706
BEFORE WE GIFT WRAP HIM.

27:53.740 --> 27:55.641
SO WHAT IS THIS?

27:55.674 --> 27:57.910
- HALOTHANE.
ANIMAL SEDATIVE.

27:57.944 --> 27:59.411
IT'LL KEEP HIM OUT COLD
UNTIL HE GETS

27:59.445 --> 28:01.914
TO WHATEVER PIT
JAMES IS THROWING HIM INTO.

28:01.948 --> 28:05.852
- PIT, HUH?

28:05.885 --> 28:07.219
- HE'S JUST GETTING
WHAT HE DESERVES.

28:07.253 --> 28:08.587
- HEY, I'M NOT FRIEND
TO CABRAL.

28:08.620 --> 28:10.422
I MEAN, THE GUY
ALMOST KILLED ME.

28:10.456 --> 28:12.759
I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT YOU'RE
ENJOYING THIS A LITTLE TOO MUCH.

28:12.792 --> 28:14.761
- ENJOYING THIS?

28:14.794 --> 28:17.563
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS JOB
FOR ALMOST A YEAR, SAM.

28:17.596 --> 28:19.231
- THAT'S WHAT
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

28:19.265 --> 28:21.333
LOOK, I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND.

28:21.367 --> 28:24.603
I CAN SEE THAT LOOK
IN YOUR EYE.

28:24.636 --> 28:26.505
THIS GUY JAMES--
HE'S GETTING TO YOU.

28:26.538 --> 28:27.940
THEY ALL ARE.

28:27.974 --> 28:30.309
- I KNOW.

28:32.478 --> 28:36.916
THAT'S WHY I NEED YOU HERE.

28:36.949 --> 28:40.719
I KNOW WHO JAMES IS.
I KNOW WHO SONYA IS.

28:40.753 --> 28:43.589
BUT IT'S DIFFICULT TO WORK
SO HARD TO BE PART OF SOMETHING

28:43.622 --> 28:45.391
KNOWING YOU
HAVE TO DESTROY IT.

28:45.424 --> 28:49.428
THESE PEOPLE BELIEVE
IN WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

28:49.461 --> 28:54.133
I'M SORRY I'M PUTTING YOU
IN THIS SITUATION, BUT...

28:54.166 --> 28:57.937
I DON'T THINK
I CAN DO THIS ALONE.

28:57.970 --> 29:00.106
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO, BUD.

29:05.011 --> 29:07.914
ALL RIGHT.
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE IN BUSINESS.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.656
SENOR CABRAL.
RIGHT ON TIME.

29:17.689 --> 29:19.591
PLEASURE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

29:19.625 --> 29:21.828
I'M SO GLAD WE HAD A SECOND
CHANCE TO GET ACQUAINTED.

29:21.861 --> 29:23.095
- YOU BROUGHT THE MONEY.

29:23.129 --> 29:24.563
- YUP, IT'S HERE,
AND IT'S ALL YOURS

29:24.596 --> 29:26.232
UPON SIGNING
THE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.667
PAPERWORK'S IN THE CAR
SO YOU CAN STUDY IT

29:28.700 --> 29:30.736
IN THE LAP OF LUXURY
ON THE WAY TO THE DOCKS.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.305
I'LL TAKE IT
FROM HERE, AMIGO.

29:33.339 --> 29:34.974
- IT'S OKAY.

29:35.007 --> 29:36.809
- IS THERE A PROBLEM?
- NO. NO PROBLEM.

29:36.843 --> 29:38.244
I PREFER TO TAKE MY OWN CAR.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.112
WE'LL FOLLOW YOU
TO THE BOAT.

29:40.146 --> 29:42.581
IF I LIKE WHAT I SEE,
WE HAVE A DEAL.

29:42.614 --> 29:45.751
IF I DON'T LIKE WHAT I SEE,
I HAVE MY MEN.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.686
- I UNDERSTAND
THE NEED FOR SECURITY.

29:47.719 --> 29:49.755
BUT A PARADE
OF ANGRY GUYS WITH GUNS

29:49.788 --> 29:51.357
IS JUST GONNA PAINT
A BULL'S-EYE ON YOUR FOREHEAD.

29:51.390 --> 29:53.159
- MY MEN ARE THE BEST
ON THE ISLAND.

29:53.192 --> 29:54.360
THEY CAN HANDLE ANY ATTACK.

29:54.393 --> 29:55.661
- THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD,

29:55.694 --> 29:57.163
BUT SEE, WE'RE GOING
TO A PRIVATE MARINA, SO--

29:57.196 --> 29:59.265
- MR. FINLEY...

29:59.298 --> 30:01.100
WHY ARE YOU SO ANXIOUS
TO SEPARATE ME FROM MY MEN?

30:01.133 --> 30:03.002
- [chuckles]
OKAY, WHOA, HEY.

30:03.035 --> 30:04.270
EASY, COWBOY.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.939
SENOR CABRAL,
WE'RE BOTH BUSINESSMEN HERE.

30:06.973 --> 30:08.274
PUT THE WEAPONS AWAY,

30:08.307 --> 30:10.142
I'M SURE WE CAN HANDLE THIS
WITHOUT VIOLENCE.

30:10.176 --> 30:12.444
- ONE OF THE BASIC
RULES OF COMBAT IS...

30:12.478 --> 30:14.046
- KILL HIM.

30:14.080 --> 30:16.215
- HIT FIRST, AND HIT HARD.
[engine revs, tires squeal]

30:16.248 --> 30:18.784
YOU ONLY GET ONE CHANCE
TO SURPRISE YOUR ENEMY.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.153
THE IMPORTANT THING
IS TO MAKE IT COUNT.

30:28.694 --> 30:31.063
- GO! GO! GO!

30:31.097 --> 30:33.799
[tires squeal]

30:33.832 --> 30:38.404
[gunshots pinging]

30:43.575 --> 30:45.244
- SPIES ARE TRAINED
EXTENSIVELY

30:45.277 --> 30:48.147
ON WHAT TO DO
WHEN TAKEN PRISONER.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.649
IF ESCAPE IS IMPOSSIBLE,
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

30:50.682 --> 30:52.484
IS TO MAKE A CONNECTION
WITH YOUR CAPTOR.

30:52.518 --> 30:55.054
FIND OUT WHAT THEY WANT
AND TRY TO TALK YOUR WAY

30:55.087 --> 30:57.489
OUT OF THE SITUATION
WITHOUT BLOODSHED.

30:57.523 --> 30:59.058
- HEY, MAN.

30:59.091 --> 31:00.259
MY FRIENDS ARE OUTSIDE.

31:00.292 --> 31:02.561
THEY'RE GONNA BE
COMING IN HERE ANY MINUTE.

31:02.594 --> 31:04.997
WHAT'S THAT?

31:05.031 --> 31:07.233
- I'D BE STILL IF I WERE YOU.

31:07.266 --> 31:10.202
- OF COURSE, IT'S A LOT HARDER
TO CONNECT WITH SOMEONE

31:10.236 --> 31:12.371
WHO HAPPENS TO BE
CRIMINALLY INSANE.

31:12.404 --> 31:13.505
[beeps]

31:13.539 --> 31:15.942
- THIS IS ETHYLENE OXIDE
AND PERCHLORIC ACID.

31:15.975 --> 31:17.376
IT'S HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE.

31:17.409 --> 31:20.879
AND THAT'S GONNA
BUY US SOME PRIVACY.

31:20.913 --> 31:23.882
- LISTEN TO ME,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

31:23.916 --> 31:27.053
- [laughs]
I'M AFRAID I DO.

31:27.086 --> 31:28.720
NOW I'M GONNA ASK YOU
SOME QUESTIONS,

31:28.754 --> 31:32.624
AND IF I DON'T LIKE YOUR ANSWERS
OR IF I THINK THAT YOU'RE LYING,

31:32.658 --> 31:34.961
I AM GOING TO TAKE US
TO HELL TOGETHER.

31:34.994 --> 31:35.962
[knock on door]

31:35.995 --> 31:38.030
- CAN YOU HEAR ME?

31:38.064 --> 31:39.966
WE WANT TO NEGOTIATE.

31:39.999 --> 31:44.536
- JUST BACK OFF
OR I WILL KILL HIM!

31:44.570 --> 31:46.638
- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BREACH.

31:46.672 --> 31:47.706
- THIS THING IS ALREADY
OUT OF CONTROL.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.308
WE START BLOWING DOORS
OFF OF HINGES,

31:49.341 --> 31:50.809
OUR QUARANTINE STORY
IS SHOT.

31:50.842 --> 31:52.411
- WELL, I WOULD RATHER
EXPLAIN A BREACHED DOOR

31:52.444 --> 31:55.314
THAN A DEAD BODY...
OR TWO.

31:58.317 --> 32:00.386
- ALL RIGHT, DO IT.

32:00.419 --> 32:03.122
- I'M GONNA NEED A DET CORD
AND BLASTING CAPS.

32:03.155 --> 32:06.558
- NOW...

32:06.592 --> 32:10.729
IS HE HERE?

32:10.762 --> 32:12.965
- IS WHO HERE?

32:12.999 --> 32:15.934
- [grunts]

32:15.968 --> 32:18.470
- I KNOW WHO SENT YOU,
SO WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS

32:18.504 --> 32:20.339
IS HE HERE?

32:20.372 --> 32:23.342
- I WOULD LOVE TO ANSWER YOU.

32:23.375 --> 32:25.144
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

32:25.177 --> 32:26.979
- JAMES!

32:27.013 --> 32:31.984
WHERE IS JAMES KENDRICK?

32:32.018 --> 32:35.187
- JAMES KENDRICK?

32:35.221 --> 32:36.888
THAT'S HIS LAST NAME?
KENDRICK?

32:39.491 --> 32:40.959
WELL, YOU JUST TOLD ME
MORE ABOUT THAT GUY

32:40.993 --> 32:44.663
THAN WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO FIND OUT
FOR A MONTH.

32:50.869 --> 32:52.938
- WHAT?

32:52.971 --> 32:55.507
- I'M WORKING WITH THE CIA.

32:55.541 --> 32:57.643
WE'RE AFTER THE HEAD
OF A TERRORIST NETWORK.

32:57.676 --> 33:02.481
UP UNTIL ABOUT TEN SECONDS AGO
WE ONLY KNEW HIM AS JAMES.

33:02.514 --> 33:03.482
- NO, YOU'RE LYING.

33:03.515 --> 33:05.684
- I'M NOT LYING, MAN.

33:05.717 --> 33:07.119
- YOU'RE LYING. THIS IS
ANOTHER ONE OF HIS TRICKS.

33:07.153 --> 33:08.354
SEE, HE SENT YOU
TO GET RID OF ME,

33:08.387 --> 33:09.988
AND NOW THAT I'VE
TURNED THE TABLES,

33:10.022 --> 33:11.623
YOU'RE PRETENDING
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW HIM.

33:11.657 --> 33:13.625
- BUDDY, YOU GOT A BOMB
AROUND MY NECK.

33:13.659 --> 33:16.362
I'M NOT TRYING TO TRICK YOU.

33:16.395 --> 33:19.731
I DON'T WORK
FOR JAMES KENDRICK.

33:19.765 --> 33:20.732
I'M HERE TO HELP YOU.

33:20.766 --> 33:23.102
- [laughing]

33:26.004 --> 33:28.307
- YOU WANNA LET ME IN
ON THE JOKE?

33:28.340 --> 33:31.877
- [laughing, pounding]

33:34.180 --> 33:36.882
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHY I'VE BEEN

33:36.915 --> 33:40.286
ROTTING IN A MENTAL INSTITUTION
FOR THE PAST 15 YEARS?

33:42.221 --> 33:46.292
BECAUSE THAT BASTARD
PUT ME THERE.

33:49.361 --> 33:50.429
WHEN HE FINDS OUT THAT YOU--

33:50.462 --> 33:52.431
[explosion]

33:52.464 --> 33:54.166
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
DON'T MOVE!

33:54.200 --> 33:55.167
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

33:55.201 --> 33:56.235
NO, EVERYBODY, WAIT!
WAIT!

33:56.268 --> 33:57.836
WE'RE ALL
ON THE SAME TEAM HERE.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.205
- BACK OFF,
OR EVERYBODY DIES.

33:59.238 --> 34:02.040
- JESSE, YOU HAVE AN IMPROVISED
EXPLOSIVE ON YOUR CHEST

34:02.074 --> 34:03.175
AND HE HAS THE TRIGGER.

34:03.209 --> 34:04.676
HOW ARE YOU
ON THE SAME TEAM?

34:04.710 --> 34:08.780
- LISTEN TO ME.
HE'S THE VICTIM HERE.

34:08.814 --> 34:10.616
- I DON'T THINK
SHE BELIEVES YOU.

34:10.649 --> 34:12.451
- OH, SHE DOES
BECAUSE SHE TRUSTS ME.

34:12.484 --> 34:15.020
AND SHE'S MY FRIEND.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.823
SHE'S GONNA PUT THE GUN DOWN
RIGHT NOW.

34:22.928 --> 34:25.030
- WHAT ABOUT HIM?

34:25.063 --> 34:28.800
- THAT'S THE CIA AGENT
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.

34:28.834 --> 34:30.969
WOULDN'T EXACTLY
CALL HIM A FRIEND, BUT...

34:31.002 --> 34:32.871
I GUARANTEE YOU THIS,
HE WANTS TO TAKE DOWN JAMES

34:32.904 --> 34:35.974
JUST AS MUCH AS YOU DO.

34:40.979 --> 34:43.215
- HE'S RIGHT.

34:43.249 --> 34:45.817
I CAN HELP YOU.

34:45.851 --> 34:47.419
WHATEVER JAMES DID TO YOU--

34:47.453 --> 34:51.457
- HE TOOK MY LIFE AWAY.

34:51.490 --> 34:54.059
- YOU HELP ME...

34:54.092 --> 34:57.629
AND I'LL DO
EVERYTHING I CAN

34:57.663 --> 34:59.331
TO GIVE IT BACK TO YOU.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.803
I PROMISE.

35:09.641 --> 35:13.512
- HOW'S CABRAL
DOING BACK THERE?

35:13.545 --> 35:16.348
- AH, HE'S SLEEPING LIKE
A HEAVILY-SEDATED EVIL BABY.

35:16.382 --> 35:17.816
HOW MUCH FURTHER
TO THE RENDEZVOUS?

35:17.849 --> 35:19.318
- A FEW MILES.

35:19.351 --> 35:21.687
JAMES IS MEETING US
AT A COMMERCIAL MARINA

35:21.720 --> 35:25.324
OUTSIDE SANTO DOMINGO.

35:25.357 --> 35:27.793
EXTRACTING A HIGH-VALUE TARGET
FROM A FOREIGN COUNTRY

35:27.826 --> 35:30.496
IS A CHALLENGE
EVEN UNDER IDEAL CONDITIONS.

35:30.529 --> 35:32.264
IF THE CAPTURE OF THE TARGET

35:32.298 --> 35:34.132
LEFT WITNESSES
AND RAISED ALARMS,

35:34.166 --> 35:35.801
IT'S EVEN HARDER.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.336
THE PROBLEM IS THAT
HIGH-VALUE TARGETS

35:37.369 --> 35:39.104
TEND TO HAVE A LOT
OF FRIENDS AND ALLIES.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.373
THEY CAN ALERT
LOCAL AUTHORITIES,

35:41.407 --> 35:42.808
SET UP SEARCH PARTIES,

35:42.841 --> 35:44.810
[tires screech]
AND IF YOU'RE REALLY UNLUCKY,

35:44.843 --> 35:46.778
THEY CAN BRING OUT
SOME BIG GUNS OF THEIR OWN.

35:46.812 --> 35:50.282
- WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON UP THERE?

35:50.316 --> 35:51.483
AW, CRAP.

35:51.517 --> 35:53.719
- LOOKS LIKE
CABRAL'S DCA GUYS.

35:53.752 --> 35:55.654
- [speaks Spanish]

35:55.687 --> 35:57.323
- LOOK, CAN WE JUST
HIGHTAIL IT OUTTA HERE?

35:57.356 --> 35:59.458
- NO, THAT .50 CAL
WOULD SHRED US

35:59.491 --> 36:00.959
BEFORE WE EVEN
TURNED AROUND.

36:00.992 --> 36:05.397
- [speaks Spanish]

36:05.431 --> 36:07.333
- WELL, IT WAS FUN
WHILE IT LASTED.

36:07.366 --> 36:08.567
- SAM, WAIT.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.869
- WAIT. WAIT FOR WHAT?
FOR THEM TO KILL US?

36:10.902 --> 36:13.138
- THEY'RE TOO FAR AWAY
TO SEE INTO THE CAR.

36:13.171 --> 36:16.642
THERE MIGHT BE A WAY OUT.

36:16.675 --> 36:20.145
WHAT SIZE SHIRT
DO YOU THINK HE WEARS?

36:20.178 --> 36:24.650
- [speaks Spanish]

36:24.683 --> 36:27.486
- OKAY, MIKE,
YOU GOT 50 FEET TO COVER.

36:27.519 --> 36:30.489
YOUR HANDS ARE TIED,
YOU'RE WEARING A HEAD BAG.

36:30.522 --> 36:32.524
YOU FEELING LUCKY?

36:32.558 --> 36:35.261
I'LL TAKE THAT AS A YES.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.035
- HOLA, MUCHACHOS.

36:44.069 --> 36:48.374
[speaking Spanish]

36:50.642 --> 36:55.614
[speaking Spanish]

36:55.647 --> 36:58.317
- [speaks Spanish]

37:00.819 --> 37:04.222
- OKAY.
[speaks Spanish]

37:04.256 --> 37:05.857
GOOD LUCK, BROTHER.

37:05.891 --> 37:10.662
[speaking Spanish]

37:13.164 --> 37:15.301
- ONE OF THE OLDEST TRICKS
IN ESPIONAGE

37:15.334 --> 37:17.569
IS THE FALSE SURRENDER
OF A PRISONER.

37:17.603 --> 37:19.971
IT'S A DESPERATE MOVE
USED ONLY WHEN YOU'RE

37:20.005 --> 37:22.374
COMPLETELY OUTMANNED
AND OUTGUNNED.

37:22.408 --> 37:26.312
IT MEANS APPROACHING
YOUR ENEMY ALONE AND UNARMED.

37:26.345 --> 37:29.415
IT'S NOT IDEAL.

37:29.448 --> 37:32.484
BUT IT WILL GET YOU
CLOSE ENOUGH TO ATTACK.

37:34.353 --> 37:36.054
- [speaks Spanish]

37:36.087 --> 37:39.057
[rock music]

*

37:52.704 --> 37:54.005
GOTTA SAY, MIKE.

37:54.039 --> 37:56.475
DON'T ALWAYS ENJOY THESE LITTLE
TROPICAL VACATIONS,

37:56.508 --> 37:58.510
BUT THEY'RE NEVER DULL.
[grunts]

38:03.615 --> 38:05.451
[engine starts]

38:15.193 --> 38:17.696
- IT IS A PLEASURE
TO FINALLY MEET YOU, MR. AXE.

38:17.729 --> 38:19.998
I'VE HEARD GOOD THINGS.
- YEAH. RIGHT BACK AT YOU.

38:20.031 --> 38:24.269
- IT WAS GOOD WORK TODAY.
THE DR LOSES A MURDERER.

38:24.302 --> 38:26.605
AND WE GAIN ACCESS
TO THE LARGEST

38:26.638 --> 38:28.507
PRIVATE INTELLIGENCE NETWORK
IN THE CARIBBEAN.

38:28.540 --> 38:29.841
- NICE BOAT, JAMES.

38:29.875 --> 38:32.010
A LITTLE SMALL TO FIT
ALL OF US AND THE BOX.

38:32.043 --> 38:33.011
- YES. YES, IT IS.

38:33.044 --> 38:35.381
YOU TWO
WON'T BE COMING WITH.

38:35.414 --> 38:36.715
TICKETS UNDER THESE NAMES.

38:36.748 --> 38:41.720
SAFE TRAVELS,
BOTH OF YOU.

38:41.753 --> 38:45.691
JAMES, I KNOW CABRAL'S FILE
BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS.

38:45.724 --> 38:47.192
WHATEVER YOU HAVE
PLANNED FOR HIM,

38:47.225 --> 38:48.159
I CAN HELP.

38:48.193 --> 38:49.528
TAKE US WITH YOU.

38:49.561 --> 38:52.063
- I ADMIRE YOUR ENTHUSIASM,
MICHAEL.

38:52.097 --> 38:54.332
YOUR PART IN THIS--
IT'S OVER.

38:54.366 --> 38:57.202
NOW YOU'VE PROVEN YOURSELF TO BE
EVERYTHING I COULD'VE HOPED FOR

38:57.235 --> 38:58.404
AND MORE.

38:58.437 --> 39:00.238
GO HOME. GET SOME REST.

39:00.271 --> 39:04.242
YOU EARNED IT.

39:04.275 --> 39:05.911
[boat engine starts]

39:17.856 --> 39:22.093
- WELL, YOU HEARD THE MAN.
LET'S GO HOME.

39:27.899 --> 39:32.438
[indistinct chatter]

39:32.471 --> 39:34.540
AH.
HEY, LOOK WHO'S HOME.

39:34.573 --> 39:36.041
- AWFUL VACATION.

39:36.074 --> 39:38.744
YOU HAVE BEEN BUSY.

39:38.777 --> 39:41.079
- YEAH, WITH A LITTLE HELP
FROM PORTER AND GLENANNE.

39:41.112 --> 39:43.014
YOU READ THE NEW FILE
ON JAMES?

39:43.048 --> 39:44.282
- VERY IMPRESSIVE
SERVICE RECORD.

39:44.315 --> 39:46.852
- YEAH, NO KIDDING.
DELTA FORCE.

39:46.885 --> 39:49.087
GOTTA LOVE HAVING
OUR ELITE MILITARY TRAINING

39:49.120 --> 39:50.255
TURNED AGAINST US.

39:50.288 --> 39:51.923
- DO WE KNOW WHY
HE WENT OFF THE RAILS?

39:51.957 --> 39:53.792
- NO.
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE.

39:53.825 --> 39:57.062
THIS NEW ASSET IS A DELTA TOO.
PETER MILLARD.

SAME UNIT, DISAPPEARED
AT THE SAME TIME.

39:59.965 --> 40:01.700
MILLARD REFUSES
TO TELL US ANY MORE,

40:01.733 --> 40:03.101
SAYS HE WANTS
TO TALK TO THE GUY

40:03.134 --> 40:04.102
THAT WAS UNDERCOVER
WITH KENDRICK.

40:04.135 --> 40:05.737
- WHY?

40:05.771 --> 40:09.741
- WHY DON'T YOU
ASK HIM YOURSELF?

40:09.775 --> 40:12.711
[ominous piano music]

40:12.744 --> 40:20.719
*

40:20.752 --> 40:24.355
- YOU THE GUY
WHO'S WORKING WITH JAMES?

40:26.357 --> 40:31.329
- NO, I'M THE ONE
WORKING TO STOP HIM.

40:31.362 --> 40:33.164
- WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
YOU CAN DO THAT?

40:33.198 --> 40:34.733
- BECAUSE I'M WILLING TO DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES,

40:34.766 --> 40:36.101
GO AS FAR
AS I HAVE TO GO.

40:36.134 --> 40:37.469
- AS FAR AS YOU HAVE TO GO?

40:37.503 --> 40:41.673
TELL ME, DO YOU KNOW
HOW FAR JAMES IS WILLING TO GO?

40:41.707 --> 40:44.643
- I'M STARTING TO.
- I DOUBT IT.

40:44.676 --> 40:47.012
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT MOGADISHU?

40:47.045 --> 40:48.446
- I KNOW YOU AND JAMES
SERVED TOGETHER THERE.

40:48.480 --> 40:51.016
ACCORDING TO THE REPORT,
YOUR UNIT WAS WIPED OUT

40:51.049 --> 40:52.684
PROTECTING A VILLAGE.

40:52.718 --> 40:54.653
HE WAS PRESUMED KIA,
AND SO WERE YOU.

40:54.686 --> 40:55.987
- IS THAT WHAT
THE REPORT SAYS?

40:56.021 --> 41:01.126
- WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED, THEN?

41:01.159 --> 41:05.997
- MY UNIT WAS SENT TO TAKE OUT
A WARLORD OUTSIDE MOGADISHU.

41:06.031 --> 41:09.701
TURNED OUT
THE INTELLIGENCE WAS BAD.

41:09.735 --> 41:11.637
THE WARLORD
WAS A KID WANNABE

41:11.670 --> 41:14.205
WITH A FEW RIFLES
AND SOME PUNK FRIENDS.

41:14.239 --> 41:17.342
THE CAMP WAS A VILLAGE
FULL OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN.

41:17.375 --> 41:19.377
WE RADIOED IN.

41:19.410 --> 41:21.279
GUESS SOME SUIT
UP THE LINE DIDN'T WANT

41:21.312 --> 41:23.882
A BLOTCH ON HIS RECORD.
ORDERS CAME DOWN.

41:23.915 --> 41:28.820
"WIPE 'EM OUT ANYWAY."

41:28.854 --> 41:32.023
A LOT OF GUYS DIDN'T LIKE IT,
BUT ORDERS WERE ORDERS.

41:32.057 --> 41:33.191
I COULDN'T DO IT.

41:33.224 --> 41:35.561
JAMES WAS MY BEST FRIEND
IN THE UNIT.

41:35.594 --> 41:36.862
I ASKED HIM
TO TALK THEM OUT OF IT,

41:36.895 --> 41:38.129
HE SAID HE'D TRY.

41:38.163 --> 41:39.330
- BUT IT DIDN'T WORK?

41:39.364 --> 41:40.866
- NO.

41:40.899 --> 41:45.737
THEY WOULDN'T DISOBEY
A DIRECT ORDER.

41:45.771 --> 41:47.405
I TOLD HIM
WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING,

41:47.438 --> 41:51.743
HE SAID HE'D HANDLE IT,
AND I THOUGHT...

41:54.379 --> 41:56.982
GOD, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I THOUGHT.

41:57.015 --> 42:00.686
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

42:00.719 --> 42:03.354
PETER, IF I'M GONNA HELP YOU,
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT I'M FACING.

42:03.388 --> 42:08.193
WHAT DID HE DO?

42:09.761 --> 42:13.732
- HE KILLED THEM ALL.

42:13.765 --> 42:18.036
THE WHOLE UNIT.

42:18.069 --> 42:22.040
SLIT THEIR THROATS
WHILE THEY WERE SLEEPING.

42:22.073 --> 42:25.043
YOU THINK YOU CAN STOP HIM?
NO ONE CAN STOP HIM.

42:25.076 --> 42:27.012
I TRIED.
HE PUT ME AWAY.

42:27.045 --> 42:31.549
BURIED.
15 YEARS.

42:31.583 --> 42:34.686
I LOVED THAT MAN.

42:34.720 --> 42:38.223
WOULD'VE FOLLOWED HIM
ANYWHERE.

42:38.256 --> 42:41.059
AND HE LED ME
STRAIGHT TO HELL.
