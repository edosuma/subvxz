WEBVTT

00:01.360 --> 00:03.726
Previously on Elementary...
The district attorney is,

00:03.770 --> 00:05.726
at this very moment,
deciding whether or not

00:05.770 --> 00:07.658
I should be charged
with felonious assault.

00:07.700 --> 00:09.133
What happened?

00:09.170 --> 00:11.434
I beat a former acquaintance
nearly to death.

00:11.470 --> 00:13.335
That was my barrister.
It seems you will not have

00:13.380 --> 00:14.608
to visit me in prison after all.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.176
Did you misplace my number?

00:16.210 --> 00:18.599
Some things are better
to discuss in person.

00:18.650 --> 00:20.777
Like violating
campaign finance laws,

00:20.820 --> 00:23.516
bribing elected officials,
that sort of thing.

00:23.550 --> 00:25.745
You funded a super PAC that
supports the district attorney.

00:25.790 --> 00:27.655
And just like that,
Sherlock is no longer

00:27.690 --> 00:30.250
facing criminal charges
against Oscar Rankin.

00:30.290 --> 00:33.157
I've always been willing to go
to lengths to protect Sherlock.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.191
So have I. You should
keep that in mind,

00:35.230 --> 00:37.061
because Sherlock
is gonna call you tonight

00:37.100 --> 00:39.432
and he's gonna accept your help.

00:39.470 --> 00:42.064
(siren wailing in distance)
(jackhammering)

00:48.710 --> 00:52.840
* Oh, God didn't make
the little green apples *

00:52.880 --> 00:57.749
_ * And _it don't rain in _
Indianapolis In the summertime *

00:57.790 --> 00:59.849
*

00:59.890 --> 01:02.779
* And there's no such thing

01:02.830 --> 01:05.856
* As Dr. Seuss, Disneyland
Hey, watch it.
(grunts)

01:05.890 --> 01:09.462
* Mother Goose,
there's no nursery rhymes *

01:09.500 --> 01:13.459
* God didn't make
the little green apples... *

01:13.500 --> 01:14.694
(screaming, shouting)

01:14.740 --> 01:15.798
(gunshot)

01:26.520 --> 01:27.817
(gunshot)

01:45.330 --> 01:48.163
"Brother, hearken,
while I tell you,

01:48.200 --> 01:50.202
"What we Masons pledge to do.

01:51.870 --> 01:53.804
"Prepared at yonder altar,

01:53.840 --> 01:55.569
We assumed the Mason's vow..."

01:55.610 --> 01:58.875
(doorbell ringing)

01:58.910 --> 02:03.449
"Foot and knee,
breast, hand and cheek...

02:04.920 --> 02:07.480
Hearken while I make them
speak..."

02:07.520 --> 02:10.455
(doorbell ringing)
(sighs)

02:12.930 --> 02:14.898
MAN: Dude, whoever they are,
they can wait.

02:14.930 --> 02:17.524
Apologies.
(man groans)

02:24.770 --> 02:26.271
Father.

02:26.310 --> 02:28.175
Sherlock.
Forgive
my appearance.

02:28.210 --> 02:30.440
I'm just paying off a debt
to some online associates.

02:30.480 --> 02:32.516
I see.
Nothing untoward.

02:32.550 --> 02:35.178
A hacker collective asked me
to perform a few Masonic chants

02:35.220 --> 02:39.384
for their amusement.
Perhaps it's best I don't
hear the full explanation.

02:39.420 --> 02:41.786
Well, it was a small price
to pay for their help.

02:41.820 --> 02:43.458
We just recovered
an original printing

02:43.490 --> 02:44.957
of The First
Book of Urizen.

02:44.990 --> 02:47.299
Oh, the prophecies
of William Blake.

02:47.330 --> 02:49.218
Stolen by
a hammer-thumbed dry cleaner.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.862
As I predicted.
Watson is at this moment

02:50.900 --> 02:52.697
obtaining a confession
at the station.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.298
Why haven't you answered
my calls?

02:54.340 --> 02:55.864
Aside from force of habit?

02:55.900 --> 02:57.208
I'm unable to.

02:57.240 --> 02:58.867
One of the hackers
locked my phone

02:58.910 --> 03:00.798
until I've finished chanting.

03:00.840 --> 03:04.207
So what's so important
you couldn't leave a message?

03:04.250 --> 03:06.275
REPORTER: ...this horrible scene
in the Financial District.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.276
We are just getting word now
that a ninth victim,

03:08.320 --> 03:09.912
who was taken to the hospital,

03:09.950 --> 03:11.884
is reported stable.
That brings the tally

03:11.920 --> 03:14.514
to four dead, five wounded
in Mannahatta Park.

03:15.720 --> 03:18.587
Not a good day to
be out of reach.

03:22.830 --> 03:25.822
Why are you here?

03:32.340 --> 03:34.228
Who's this?

03:34.280 --> 03:37.306
Sniper named
Pierre Gagnier.

03:37.350 --> 03:38.977
Formerly French Special Forces.

03:39.010 --> 03:42.616
He's the one responsible
for this bloodshed.

03:44.550 --> 03:47.951
*

04:18.450 --> 04:20.953
BELL:
Shooter picked the right perch.

04:20.990 --> 04:23.322
Building management
says construction here

04:23.360 --> 04:25.021
got shut down
a month ago.

04:25.060 --> 04:28.848
Union dispute with the law firm
that owns it, Zyckner Williams.

04:28.900 --> 04:32.893
Floor's always vacant. No
cameras. Nobody saw a thing.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.864
There's no latent prints on the
gun. He must've worn gloves.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.868
I'm gonna go ahead and guess:

04:37.910 --> 04:39.332
it's not registered.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.972
Serial number says
it was stolen

04:41.010 --> 04:44.548
from a sporting goods store
in 2005. Dead end.

04:44.580 --> 04:46.969
I had to go through a
metal detector in the lobby

04:47.020 --> 04:48.419
to get up here.
The bottom
SIX floors

04:48.450 --> 04:50.589
of this building
are SEC offices,

04:50.620 --> 04:52.019
so security's pretty high.

04:52.050 --> 04:54.018
Just... not high enough.

04:54.060 --> 04:56.858
(phone ringing)

04:56.890 --> 04:59.859
This is Joan. She's with the
building people, pulling tape.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.856
You've got me
and the captain.

05:01.900 --> 05:03.891
I wish I had good news.

05:03.930 --> 05:05.591
Security just finished
a second sweep of the building,

05:05.630 --> 05:08.098
but the gun is still
the only trace of the sniper.

05:08.140 --> 05:10.961
Any way in and out of this place
that he could've avoided

05:11.010 --> 05:12.978
the security cameras
in the lobby?

05:13.010 --> 05:15.478
No. He has to be on the tape,
coming and going.

05:15.510 --> 05:18.673
But we've been looking,
and so far nobody jumps out.

05:18.710 --> 05:19.938
You able to get ahold
of your partner yet?

05:19.980 --> 05:21.948
No, I still haven't been able
to reach him.

05:21.980 --> 05:23.982
Well, dig him up.

05:24.020 --> 05:25.487
We got a lunatic out here,

05:25.520 --> 05:28.353
and he didn't leave us
much to work with.

05:28.390 --> 05:29.982
Three years ago,
I was shepherding a project

05:30.030 --> 05:32.624
in Maharashtra, India.

05:32.660 --> 05:36.096
A large mining company wanted
to secure extraction rights

05:36.130 --> 05:38.598
for a particularly
promising vein of bauxite.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.439
We had a problem with
a local bureaucrat

05:40.470 --> 05:43.507
who was overzealous in his
application of red tape.

05:43.540 --> 05:45.508
The delay was costing my client
millions,

05:45.540 --> 05:48.771
so they asked that I consider
certain remedies.

05:48.810 --> 05:50.448
If you're about to confess
a crime and you're expecting

05:50.480 --> 05:52.846
my confidence,
I beg you reconsider.

05:52.880 --> 05:55.440
I told my client that
I would never entertain the idea

05:55.480 --> 05:56.981
of harming the man.

05:57.020 --> 05:58.885
So I was
dismissed.

05:58.920 --> 06:02.481
And replaced not
with a rival consultancy

06:02.530 --> 06:04.589
but with Rponse.

06:04.630 --> 06:07.019
French mercenary outfit?

06:07.060 --> 06:10.598
That was November,
two years ago, in Mumbai.

06:10.630 --> 06:13.098
When a sniper killed 13 people.

06:13.140 --> 06:16.098
All to mask the assassination
of the offending paper pusher.

06:16.140 --> 06:17.937
A singular target
was never presumed.

06:17.970 --> 06:19.779
He was too well hidden.

06:19.810 --> 06:23.075
A pin among so many
in a pincushion.

06:23.110 --> 06:25.101
Shooter was never identified.

06:25.150 --> 06:27.072
Not by the
authorities, no.

06:27.120 --> 06:30.487
I made my own inquiries.
I developed a contact inside

06:30.520 --> 06:34.581
Rponse, and they
served up this man,

06:34.620 --> 06:36.110
a freelancer hired
to do the killing.

06:36.160 --> 06:38.025
Sadly,

06:38.060 --> 06:40.949
I could never manage
to interest the local police.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.797
And what makes you think
he repeated

06:42.830 --> 06:44.798
his pincushion performance
today?

06:44.830 --> 06:46.969
We'll need your computer.

06:48.470 --> 06:50.904
Search for cell phone videos
of today's attack.

06:50.940 --> 06:53.534
You know how quickly
these things leak these days.

06:55.110 --> 06:56.907
(shouting, crying)
You'll see in
the footage

06:56.950 --> 06:58.906
a perfectly alternating pattern

06:58.950 --> 07:01.145
of fatalities and leg wounds.

07:01.180 --> 07:03.011
It was the same in Mumbai?

07:03.050 --> 07:06.042
That such a precise pattern
should happen once,

07:06.090 --> 07:08.979
much less recur,
is highly unlikely.

07:09.020 --> 07:11.989
(shouting continues)

07:12.030 --> 07:13.895
I think you're right.

07:13.930 --> 07:16.091
The sniper is making
a concerted effort

07:16.130 --> 07:18.598
not only to hide his target
but also

07:18.630 --> 07:21.064
his skill.

07:21.100 --> 07:23.159
Well, I must say I'm impressed.

07:23.210 --> 07:24.700
If there's room on your wall

07:24.740 --> 07:26.139
amongst the Thatcher
photographs, you may soon

07:26.170 --> 07:28.934
be able to hang
a commendation from the NYPD.

07:28.980 --> 07:31.904
You can't share any of this
with the police, Sherlock.

07:32.950 --> 07:35.669
Your mole in Rponse.

07:35.720 --> 07:38.883
There's no way to turn this over
without exposing him.

07:38.920 --> 07:42.048
I'd expect the group's reprisal
to be thorough.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.094
I'll set to work corroborating

07:47.130 --> 07:48.620
Gagnier's involvement
independenï¬‚y,

07:48.660 --> 07:50.218
and then I will go
to the police.

07:50.270 --> 07:52.761
I'd like to help you.

07:52.800 --> 07:55.064
I know we rarely spoke
during your Scotland Yard days,

07:55.100 --> 07:58.706
but I do recall that
you often made use of experts

07:58.740 --> 08:00.901
in other fields. Your...

08:00.940 --> 08:02.805
Unusuals.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.499
Irregulars.

08:04.550 --> 08:06.711
And unless you've become
an expert in sniping,

08:06.750 --> 08:09.275
I fail to see
how you can a55ist me.

08:09.320 --> 08:13.154
I'm no detective, but I do have
resources and contacts.

08:13.190 --> 08:17.854
You're set to profit in India
if the sniper is captured.

08:17.890 --> 08:20.688
My former client will certainly
lose their mining rights

08:20.730 --> 08:22.698
if the truth comes to light.

08:22.730 --> 08:25.164
And I won't deny
that I have positioned myself

08:25.200 --> 08:28.033
to scoop them up
for one of their competitors.

08:28.070 --> 08:30.038
But that's not why I'm here.

08:30.070 --> 08:32.573
I'm here
because four people are dead.

08:32.610 --> 08:34.874
Gagnier was out
of the country six hours

08:34.910 --> 08:36.707
after the Mumbai attacks.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.968
We can stand here
and talk if you wish,

08:39.010 --> 08:42.241
but I think you'd be wiser
to accept my help and begin.

08:44.320 --> 08:45.844
You must be
Morland's boy.

08:45.890 --> 08:47.312
How do you do?
I'm Bill Wellstone.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.816
This is our
general counsel,

08:48.860 --> 08:49.884
Joel Fitzgerald.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.158
Bill, I said

08:51.190 --> 08:52.828
there was no need for a lawyer.

08:52.860 --> 08:55.124
In fact,
I told you we'd be content

08:55.160 --> 08:56.991
sitting down
with your head of I.T.

08:57.030 --> 08:59.669
Well, to be honest,
we were fighting over

08:59.700 --> 09:02.294
who got to take a meeting
with the Morland Holmes.

09:02.340 --> 09:04.558
I, myself, can never get
enough backslapping,

09:04.610 --> 09:07.135
but I'm afraid our
time here is limited.

09:07.180 --> 09:09.102
Obviously you're aware
of the sniper attacks

09:09.140 --> 09:10.676
in Mannahatta Park today.

09:10.710 --> 09:14.009
One of your executives
was killed, Ethan Parris.

09:14.050 --> 09:16.109
Uh, it was our understanding
that the victims' names

09:16.150 --> 09:18.209
weren't being given out yet.
I managed to procure a list

09:18.250 --> 09:20.081
from the Office of the
Chief Medical Examiner.

09:20.120 --> 09:21.781
We're here

09:21.820 --> 09:23.754
because we have reason
to believe these shootings

09:23.790 --> 09:27.157
were not random, but rather
cover for an assassination.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.929
What?

09:28.960 --> 09:31.827
We think Mr. Parris
may have been the real target.

09:31.870 --> 09:35.260
He was the most prominent
of the victims by far.

09:35.300 --> 09:38.758
I'm sorry, what does that
have to do with anything?

09:38.810 --> 09:41.176
If it was an assassination,
it would be the kind

09:41.210 --> 09:43.940
which would cost upwards
of $1 million.

09:43.980 --> 09:46.244
Look, I don't
know what to say.

09:46.280 --> 09:48.248
I didn't know
Parris personally,

09:48.280 --> 09:50.339
but the report I got,
he was a good man.

09:50.390 --> 09:53.154
What kind of work did he do?
Negotiations,
mostly.

09:53.190 --> 09:55.351
I mean, he was heading
the Peru thing, right?

09:55.390 --> 09:57.722
Mmm. We-We've got
a big hydroelectric dam

09:57.760 --> 09:59.182
on the drawing board
down there.

09:59.230 --> 10:01.221
Ethan was part of the team
that was hammering out

10:01.260 --> 10:01.999
the contract
with their government.

10:02.030 --> 10:03.895
I think he was_headed
to a meeting

10:03.930 --> 10:05.363
with Zyckner Williams today
when the shooting started.

10:05.400 --> 10:07.960
Zyckner Williams?
Mm-hmm. They're
the stateside firm

10:08.000 --> 10:09.809
handling the talks
for the Peruvians.

10:09.840 --> 10:13.071
Their offices
are right near there.
We know.

10:13.110 --> 10:15.203
The sniper set up his perch
on a floor of theirs

10:15.240 --> 10:17.208
under construction.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.172
WELLSTONE:
Wait a second.

10:19.210 --> 10:21.110
You think they had him killed?

10:22.950 --> 10:24.679
What we would need
would be copies

10:24.720 --> 10:27.188
of Mr. Parris's correspondence
with Zyckner Williams

10:27.220 --> 10:29.927
and e-mails
so that we could find out.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.723
Do you have
a warrant?

10:32.760 --> 10:34.728
We're here as friends,
investigating the murder

10:34.760 --> 10:36.193
of your employee.

10:36.230 --> 10:38.391
I get that,
but we're talking about

10:38.430 --> 10:40.068
a $2.3 billion deal here.

10:40.100 --> 10:42.239
Turning over
all of our internal deal memos?

10:42.270 --> 10:44.932
That kind of exposure, I mean,
even under the circumstances,

10:44.970 --> 10:46.335
that is a huge ask.

10:46.370 --> 10:48.338
It may only be
so much time

10:48.380 --> 10:51.201
before the gunman flees
the country, gentlemen,
so I'll be blunt.

10:51.250 --> 10:55.243
The value of your dam
is $2.3 billion

10:55.280 --> 10:57.942
in theory only.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.753
It can be zero...

10:59.790 --> 11:02.258
if I call
certain friends in Lima.

11:02.290 --> 11:04.326
WELLSTONE (chuckles):
Now, that,

11:04.360 --> 11:07.090
boys and girls,
is how you deliver a threat.

11:07.130 --> 11:09.690
It's far more compelling
than a warrant.

11:09.730 --> 11:12.096
Anything you need...

11:12.130 --> 11:14.860
from Dynastic Energy...

11:14.900 --> 11:17.403
you've got it.

11:18.840 --> 11:20.671
Sherlock?

11:26.180 --> 11:28.319
HOLMES (recorded):
I would prefer a concise text,

11:28.350 --> 11:30.284
but if you absolutely must,
leave a message.

11:30.320 --> 11:31.878
(beep)
Unless you're dead,

11:31.920 --> 11:33.456
you're starting to annoy me.

11:33.490 --> 11:35.378
The sniper thing's
officially a mess.

11:35.420 --> 11:37.854
The captain wants us
to comb through security footage

11:37.890 --> 11:39.255
from the building.

11:39.290 --> 11:40.723
Call me.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.762
Let me know nothing's wrong.

11:44.230 --> 11:46.221
MAN:
You guys must be

11:46.270 --> 11:47.498
some kind
of major leaguers.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.861
I got an e-mail
from a partner I've never met

11:49.910 --> 11:52.834
telling me to get my ass
down here ASAP or he'd
have me disbarred.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.906
We appreciate you taking
time off from your drinking.

11:57.110 --> 11:58.839
Sorry.

11:58.880 --> 12:02.077
Look, can you blame me for
making the most of Sniper Day?

12:03.290 --> 12:04.746
It's like a snow day--

12:04.790 --> 12:06.382
we all got sent home
after the shooting.

12:06.420 --> 12:09.309
Perhaps your drinking is your
way of coping with the guilt.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.055
What?

12:11.090 --> 12:12.990
Four people are dead,
five more in hospital,

12:13.030 --> 12:14.759
and all because you
couldn't get along

12:14.800 --> 12:17.291
with your opposite number on
a Peruvian dam negotiation.

12:17.330 --> 12:19.059
What are you talking about?

12:19.100 --> 12:21.295
Your working relationship
with Ethan Parris

12:21.340 --> 12:24.468
turned sour, and stood in
the way of a $2.3 billion deal.

12:24.510 --> 12:27.104
So a sniper was invited
into your firm's offices

12:27.140 --> 12:28.471
to solve the problem.

12:28.510 --> 12:31.070
You think I had Ethan killed?

12:31.110 --> 12:33.010
MORLAND:
Of course not.

12:33.050 --> 12:35.814
The black-bag operatives
that your firm keeps on retainer

12:35.850 --> 12:37.886
don't take calls
from junior assoaates.

12:39.150 --> 12:40.856
HOLMES:
Divulge the name

12:40.890 --> 12:42.778
of the senior partner
that you turned to for help,

12:42.830 --> 12:44.320
and I will petition
the powers that be

12:44.360 --> 12:45.486
to extend you an immunity deal.

12:45.530 --> 12:47.157
(chuckles):
Oh, no, no way.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.156
No way. This is a joke.
We've reviewed

12:49.200 --> 12:52.829
the complete record of
your correspondence
with Ethan Parris.

12:52.870 --> 12:54.292
We're not here
by accident.

12:54.340 --> 12:55.830
This makes no sense!

12:55.870 --> 12:58.031
The shooting made no sense;
it was random.

12:58.070 --> 13:00.504
It was made to look random.

13:02.140 --> 13:04.370
Look, if you've seen
the e-mails,

13:04.410 --> 13:06.503
if you've seen the deal,
then you know--

13:06.550 --> 13:09.075
I didn't need Ethan dead;
I was kicking his ass.

13:09.120 --> 13:12.283
Mr. Parris was fleecing you
on concrete and overages.

13:13.320 --> 13:14.548
No, no. Because...

13:14.590 --> 13:16.558
HOLMES: The longer
you play dumb,

13:16.590 --> 13:18.922
Mr. Pruitt, the less likely
we are to help you.

13:23.430 --> 13:25.125
I can prove
nobody here wanted Ethan dead.

13:25.170 --> 13:27.468
I doubt you can prove you tied
your own tie this morning.

13:27.500 --> 13:29.388
Come with me.

13:31.270 --> 13:32.430
Okay.

13:33.580 --> 13:36.231
You see that,
uh, brown tower?

13:36.280 --> 13:38.373
Just to the
south there?

13:38.410 --> 13:39.877
That's where Ethan worked.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.547
Now, we went back and forth
a dozen times

13:41.580 --> 13:44.048
on this deal, and every time
I went to his office,

13:44.090 --> 13:45.944
I walked out the south entrance
right below us,

13:45.990 --> 13:48.550
and any time he came here,
he used the same doors.

13:48.590 --> 13:50.478
Now, that's
the side of the building

13:50.530 --> 13:52.122
the shooter was on,
the east side.

13:52.160 --> 13:54.890
Now, if I wanted someone
to pick Ethan off,

13:54.930 --> 13:56.921
I never would've told them
to set up there,

13:56.970 --> 13:59.495
because that's not the_direction
he would've been coming from.

13:59.530 --> 14:01.998
He'd have no shot.
MORLAND: You're
a spectacular liar,

14:02.040 --> 14:03.462
Mr. Pruitt.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.899
We've just come from
Dynastic Energy's offices.

14:05.940 --> 14:08.500
They're on the river,
east of here.

14:08.540 --> 14:10.599
No, you're talking
about the main offices.

14:10.650 --> 14:13.346
Dynastic outgrew
that space years ago.

14:13.380 --> 14:15.871
Ethan worked in their
satellite offices right there.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.945
You don't believe me,
look it up.

14:19.550 --> 14:22.485
To compare a massacre
to inclement weather.

14:22.520 --> 14:25.227
It's a shame that cretinous
man wasn involved.

14:25.260 --> 14:28.229
Detection is an exact science,
or it ought to be,

14:28.260 --> 14:31.093
and should be treated
with the same cold,
unemotional manner.

14:31.130 --> 14:33.098
What are you doing?
I'm attempting to divine

14:33.140 --> 14:36.234
the PIN number that
Everyone used to lock my phone.

14:36.270 --> 14:37.532
(electronic clinking)

14:37.570 --> 14:40.403
"Leet." Should've
guessed it. 1-3-3-7.

14:40.440 --> 14:43.079
Numeric spelling of the word
"leet," as in "elite."

14:43.110 --> 14:45.908
It's a standard hacker boast.
Why would you care?

14:45.950 --> 14:48.077
Who are you calling?
A colleague
in the department.

14:48.120 --> 14:50.384
I told you, we can't...
You're not the only person
who can keep a secret.

14:50.420 --> 14:51.910
BELL:
Holmes? I was starting to think

14:51.950 --> 14:53.611
you fell in a ditch
or something.

14:53.660 --> 14:56.515
I'm attempting to come up
to speed on the sniper attack.

14:56.560 --> 14:58.619
I'm curious to learn more
about the fatalities

14:58.660 --> 15:00.548
and what brought those
individuals to the park.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.659
At the moment,
all I have are their names.

15:02.700 --> 15:04.463
Why just the fatalities?

15:04.500 --> 15:07.298
My theory is too embryonic
to share at the moment.

15:07.340 --> 15:10.537
Okay. We got...
(sighs)

15:10.570 --> 15:12.106
Ethan Parris.

15:12.140 --> 15:13.175
He...
Not him.

15:13.210 --> 15:14.609
All right.

15:14.640 --> 15:17.973
There's Ronda Walley,
tourist from Minnesota.

15:18.010 --> 15:20.615
Uh, Steve Sachs was an ad exec.

15:20.650 --> 15:22.015
He'd just left a job interview.

15:22.050 --> 15:23.540
Finally, there's Frank Bova.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.218
He was a plumber.
Ate lunch in the park every day.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.218
Every day?

15:28.260 --> 15:29.682
According to a homeless guy
we talked to.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.620
Bova used to share
his food with him.

15:31.660 --> 15:34.390
He wasn't, by any chance,
the first person shot, was he?

15:34.430 --> 15:36.489
Yeah. How did you...

15:36.530 --> 15:39.192
What is it?
There's only one person

15:39.230 --> 15:40.663
who could reasonably
have been expected

15:40.700 --> 15:42.691
to end up in the sniper's
crosshairs today.

15:42.740 --> 15:44.628
Frank Bova.

15:44.670 --> 15:46.467
Ate lunch there regularly.

15:46.510 --> 15:48.478
He was also
the first person shot,

15:48.510 --> 15:51.968
guaranteeing he couldn't scamper
off in the ensuing chaos.

15:52.010 --> 15:54.410
Someone engaged an
international contract killer

15:54.450 --> 15:56.179
to go on a shooting spree,

15:56.220 --> 15:58.518
spending somewhere in the
neighborhood of $1 million...

15:58.550 --> 16:02.384
All to disguise the murder
of a plumber from Staten Island.

16:07.330 --> 16:09.548
(blowing whistle)

16:09.600 --> 16:11.124
Where are we going now?

16:11.170 --> 16:12.762
(blows whistle)

16:12.800 --> 16:14.768
I'm going to visit
Frank Bova's widow

16:14.800 --> 16:16.290
in Great Kills.

16:16.340 --> 16:18.706
You can go back to your
gilded throne in Midtown.

16:18.740 --> 16:20.173
(blows whistle)

16:20.210 --> 16:22.178
I offered my assistance
for the duration.

16:22.210 --> 16:24.178
You accepted.
Someone wanted
to hide

16:24.210 --> 16:25.700
the assassination
of a plumber.

16:25.750 --> 16:28.310
My path now clearly diverges
from your sphere of influence.

16:28.350 --> 16:30.739
I thank you for the doors
you've opened thus far,

16:30.790 --> 16:32.712
but I'll take it
from here.
Uh...

16:32.750 --> 16:35.014
never mind, our mistake.

16:37.060 --> 16:39.483
There isn't time for this.
You said yourself

16:39.530 --> 16:41.350
Gagnier fled Mumbai within
hours of the attack.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.721
I did.
So why did you just
send my cab away?

16:43.770 --> 16:45.726
Because I can get you
to Staten Island much faster.

16:45.770 --> 16:47.590
Jessica, dear,

16:47.640 --> 16:50.529
I'm going to need you
to send the helicopter.

16:50.570 --> 16:53.505
I don't understand.

16:53.540 --> 16:57.078
The cops that drove me down
to identify Frank

16:57.110 --> 16:58.805
said this was just
some crazy person,

16:58.850 --> 17:01.648
like... domestic
terror or something.

17:01.680 --> 17:03.819
I can't say
beyond all doubt

17:03.850 --> 17:06.182
that your husband was
specifically targeted.

17:06.220 --> 17:08.108
But that's what
you think.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.378
MORLAND:
We want to be sure that the man

17:10.430 --> 17:12.284
that did this is put to justice.

17:12.330 --> 17:15.424
Uh, and there's a chance
you can help.

17:15.460 --> 17:18.099
There's just no way.

17:18.130 --> 17:20.735
Frank had his faults,
but, I mean,

17:20.770 --> 17:22.738
we're talking
socks on the floor.

17:22.770 --> 17:25.238
He would put empty milk cartons
in the fridge.

17:25.270 --> 17:28.376
He never did anything to make
somebody want to kill him.

17:28.410 --> 17:31.800
I'm not suggesting that your
husband brought this on himself,

17:31.850 --> 17:34.045
Mrs. Bova, not necessarily.

17:35.650 --> 17:38.244
But if someone powerful
wanted him dead,

17:38.290 --> 17:40.485
the method suggests...

17:40.520 --> 17:44.149
that they thought their motive
would be too easy to detect

17:44.190 --> 17:47.751
without a great deal
of window dressing.

17:47.800 --> 17:51.622
You're saying that he had...
no such enemies?

17:51.670 --> 17:54.662
He did a lot of jobs
down near Wall Street.

17:54.700 --> 17:56.861
Tempers flare when there's
a delay sometimes,

17:56.900 --> 17:59.835
but nobody gets shot
over toilets, you know?

17:59.870 --> 18:02.338
Perhaps he saw something
he wasn't supposed to see

18:02.380 --> 18:05.178
while he was working
in one of those buildings.

18:05.210 --> 18:07.849
If he did, he didn't tell me.

18:09.620 --> 18:11.838
(crying):
I don't know.

18:11.890 --> 18:14.882
I guess we didn't talk
as much as we should.

18:14.920 --> 18:17.582
I know this is difficult.

18:19.430 --> 18:22.752
Would you mind
ifI had a look around?

18:22.800 --> 18:24.893
I'd also like to see
any personal effects

18:24.930 --> 18:27.433
that were returned
to you by the police.

18:27.470 --> 18:30.268
They're right in the kitchen.

18:32.270 --> 18:34.875
You found something in
the dead man's phone.

18:34.910 --> 18:37.378
Oh, you noticed.
What is it?

18:37.410 --> 18:40.243
Confirmation that Frank Bova
was the sniper's real target.

18:40.280 --> 18:42.248
It's a hidden tracking program.

18:42.280 --> 18:43.838
I forwarded
the relevant data

18:43.890 --> 18:45.209
to my phone.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.616
So Gagnier was observing Bova

18:47.660 --> 18:50.220
to determine _
the best place to strike.

18:50.260 --> 18:52.751
Obviously, he settled on his
quarry's favorite lunch spot.

18:52.790 --> 18:54.257
It's a clever method

18:54.300 --> 18:55.722
of surveillance,
but it is revealing--

18:55.760 --> 18:57.762
I might be able to track it
back to Gagnier.

18:57.800 --> 19:00.166
I should know by the time
we reach your whirlybird.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.206
I need to ask you
something personal.

19:03.240 --> 19:04.901
It's a medical question.
I-I wouldn't intrude,

19:04.940 --> 19:08.808
but it may well be genetic, so
on that basis I feel entitled.

19:08.840 --> 19:10.705
Are you suffering from low T?

19:11.950 --> 19:14.168
Excuse me?

19:14.220 --> 19:17.280
A deficiency, an imbalance
in your hormone levels.

19:17.320 --> 19:18.514
Is it what's causing

19:18.550 --> 19:20.381
this late-onset humanity

19:20.420 --> 19:23.651
that you've been exhibiting
since your return to New York?

19:23.690 --> 19:25.920
Is that why
you comforted Mrs. Bova?

19:25.960 --> 19:28.690
Was I such a terrible father

19:28.730 --> 19:32.325
that you can't imagine me
being kind to a widow?

19:32.370 --> 19:33.792
I'm only asking
because it is treatable.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.535
_It's not uncommon
in men of your age.

19:35.570 --> 19:36.832
Isn't the more likely
explanation that

19:36.870 --> 19:38.303
you've never seen me as I am?

19:38.340 --> 19:41.798
Owing to my deficient powers
of observation.

19:41.840 --> 19:43.478
You live a life, Sherlock.

19:43.510 --> 19:46.274
If you're not a fool,
it changes you.

19:47.850 --> 19:51.240
I don't think
that either of us is a fool.

19:55.290 --> 19:56.655
I don't know Gagnier's location,

19:56.690 --> 19:58.851
but I do know where
the program was uploaded

19:58.890 --> 20:01.495
and where it first began
transmitting Bova's whereabouts.

20:01.530 --> 20:03.293
If we go there,

20:03.330 --> 20:04.763
we might find a trail.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.495
What's the location?

20:06.530 --> 20:10.933
Not surprisingly, it's somewhere
Bova took off his pants.

20:10.970 --> 20:12.733
MAN: I'm sorry,
I don't think so.

20:12.770 --> 20:14.829
Would've been
two weeks ago. Tuesday.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.747
I'm here every day-- I don't
remember either of these guys.

20:17.780 --> 20:20.510
I could have sworn I saw
a hint of recognition there.

20:20.550 --> 20:23.246
Just to be clear,
you are covering for a killer.

20:23.290 --> 20:25.588
This man, Pierre Gagnier,

20:25.620 --> 20:28.282
followed this man,
Frank Bova, in here

20:28.320 --> 20:30.788
so he could tamper
with his phone.

20:30.830 --> 20:35.324
Subsequently, Mr. Gagnier
shot nine people downtown today.

20:35.360 --> 20:36.452
That's the guy who...?

20:36.500 --> 20:38.798
Yes. Would you like
to start again?

20:38.830 --> 20:43.267
Listen, I got no reason to
believe this story of yours,

20:43.310 --> 20:45.699
and I don't like cops.
Neither do my clients.

20:45.740 --> 20:48.538
You come in here asking
for our security videos.

20:48.580 --> 20:51.549
You got to get a warrant.
Procuring one
will be simple enough.

20:51.580 --> 20:54.276
IfI must, I assure you,
when I return,

20:54.320 --> 20:56.276
I will also return
with the Health Department.

20:56.320 --> 20:57.947
I will get the materials
that I'm requesting,

20:57.990 --> 20:59.014
and you will be shut down

20:59.050 --> 21:00.711
for insufficient
chlorination.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.057
Or have you not noticed
that your so-called "baths"

21:02.090 --> 21:04.320
are little more
than fungal soup?

21:04.360 --> 21:06.828
You do what you need to do.
Right now, you need to leave.

21:06.860 --> 21:08.020
MORLAND:
Please forgive my son.

21:08.060 --> 21:09.857
He misread you.

21:09.900 --> 21:12.528
You're obviously not a man
who can be bullied.

21:12.570 --> 21:15.038
But you are a man
who can be bribed.

21:15.070 --> 21:17.834
Shall we say $10,000?

21:17.870 --> 21:19.861
(line ringing,
cell phone rings in distance)

21:19.910 --> 21:23.004
(door opens)

21:23.040 --> 21:24.473
(cell phone ringing)

21:24.510 --> 21:28.549
So you do have
your phone with you.

21:28.580 --> 21:29.877
Were you with
your father all day

21:29.920 --> 21:31.581
or just this morning?
How did you know?

21:31.620 --> 21:33.884
There were two cups of coffee
downstairs. One had honey in it.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.319
I remember that's
how he takes his.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.385
So, where have you been?

21:37.430 --> 21:39.489
I get that your cell wasn't
working, but you are aware

21:39.530 --> 21:40.997
there are other phones
you could have used.

21:41.030 --> 21:42.520
As I said, we literally flew

21:42.560 --> 21:44.528
to and from Staten Island,
and there was never

21:46.870 --> 21:48.861
Not really. Besides,

21:48.900 --> 21:50.709
I felt better knowing
that the police's search

21:50.740 --> 21:52.901
was fortified by someone
trained in my methods.

21:52.940 --> 21:55.773
You said the captain
knows everything now.

21:55.810 --> 21:57.505
He knows a version
of everything.

21:57.550 --> 22:00.439
What matters is he knows
the sniper's presumed location.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.081
used a stolen credit card
at the Turkish baths.

22:04.120 --> 22:06.418
He used the same credit card
to secure a room

22:06.450 --> 22:08.509
at a no-tell motel
on the Lower East Side.

22:08.560 --> 22:12.382
When I called, the staff said
he was still on the premises.

22:12.430 --> 22:14.694
Hmm. Captain will let us know
soon enough.

22:14.730 --> 22:17.369
I would have expected you
to be a little more...

22:17.400 --> 22:19.925
exasperated after spending an
entire day with your father.

22:19.970 --> 22:21.460
It was interesting.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.092
Interesting.
Well, he was

22:23.140 --> 22:24.960
helpful at certain points.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.602
And I could get used to having

22:26.640 --> 22:28.471
a helicopter
at my disposal.

22:28.510 --> 22:30.068
11:32 this morning.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.648
Looks like he walked in almost
an hour before the shooting.

22:37.690 --> 22:40.454
HOLMES: You can be forgiven
for failing to flag him.

22:40.490 --> 22:42.617
Aside from a vaguely
martial gait,

22:42.660 --> 22:44.525
he does not look suspicious.

22:44.560 --> 22:47.085
And it seems he didn't
bring his rifle in himself.

22:47.130 --> 22:49.951
After his arrest, perhaps
he will tell us who he employed

22:50.000 --> 22:52.389
to help him smuggle it
past the metal detectors.

22:54.170 --> 22:56.161
Your team leader broke down
the tactical situation.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.737
I got nothing to add
to that except this.

22:58.770 --> 23:01.876
The man up there opened fire
on a crowd of innocent people.

23:01.910 --> 23:04.970
He's not gonna have any
qualms taking aim at you.

23:05.010 --> 23:07.444
Be safe. Now, let's get to it.

23:13.690 --> 23:16.158
Hold up.

23:16.190 --> 23:18.658
Hold up. You guys!
I got a camera here.

23:18.690 --> 23:20.499
(gunshots)

23:20.530 --> 23:21.599
E-11. Requesting a 10-13.

23:21.630 --> 23:23.461
Shots fired. I got
one hit in the vest.

23:23.500 --> 23:26.424
Take the door.
On three. One, two.

23:30.170 --> 23:31.432
Clear!
Clear!

23:31.470 --> 23:32.801
Detective Captain
Manhattan South

23:32.840 --> 23:35.434
to Central. I need a 10-13
(gunshot)

23:35.480 --> 23:36.833
at 236 Broome Street.

23:36.880 --> 23:38.199
I got an officer shot
at this location.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.603
Damn it.

23:41.480 --> 23:43.539
(distant shouting)

23:46.220 --> 23:48.654
(kicks gun)

24:02.100 --> 24:04.136
BELL:
When I first saw him
lying on the pavement,

24:04.170 --> 24:05.831
I assumed he'd been shot,

24:05.870 --> 24:07.838
but this graze wound was
the only shot that hit him.

24:07.880 --> 24:11.008
It spooked him,
he fell off the fire escape.

24:11.050 --> 24:13.143
Hawes said he died instantly.

24:13.180 --> 24:15.512
Don't know
what's more regrettable.

24:15.550 --> 24:16.642
That a mass murderer
didn't suffer,

24:16.680 --> 24:17.942
of that he couldn't
be taken alive.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.014
ESU did what they could.

24:19.050 --> 24:21.587
They were taking fire.
This guy had the place wired.

24:21.620 --> 24:23.485
He saw 'em coming.
I was not implying fault.

24:23.530 --> 24:25.782
I just wish he could have given
us what we needed and then died.

24:25.830 --> 24:27.252
GSR on his right palm

24:27.290 --> 24:29.497
is from the .22 caliber
he fired at the police.

24:29.530 --> 24:31.589
And there's more on his
forearm that's consistent

24:31.630 --> 24:34.098
with the bullets used
in the sniper attack.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.631
Only trace he left
to connect him to the crime--

24:36.670 --> 24:38.763
we found a slag cell phone

24:38.810 --> 24:40.539
and computer in his room.

24:40.580 --> 24:41.899
Guy was wiping the decks,
getting ready to skip.

24:44.180 --> 24:45.499
You just caught him.
Looks like

24:45.550 --> 24:47.643
he was pre-boarded
on a flight to Managua.

24:47.680 --> 24:49.511
_ BELL:_
All things conSIdered,

24:49.550 --> 24:52.212
I'm glad he ended up
here instead.

24:52.250 --> 24:54.059
Nothing else of note?

24:54.090 --> 24:55.717
You guys are welcome
to pick through

24:55.760 --> 24:57.625
the luggage he was packing,
but nothing

24:57.660 --> 24:59.184
jumped out at CSU.

24:59.230 --> 25:01.289
Looks like this guy's secrets
died with him.

25:01.330 --> 25:03.696
I dated this French guy once.

25:03.730 --> 25:05.960
I thought they were all
as bad as he was.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.968
Three bags

25:08.000 --> 25:10.605
for one weekend at the beach.

25:10.640 --> 25:13.677
This guy traveled light.

25:13.710 --> 25:16.531
I could see why
Marcus was pessimistic.

25:16.580 --> 25:19.572
All in all, a waste of
the tip my father gave us.

25:19.610 --> 25:23.114
You don't care for him much,
do you? My father?

25:23.150 --> 25:26.244
Not really, no.
Hmm.

25:26.290 --> 25:28.315
Is it because he bribed
the district attorney

25:28.360 --> 25:30.089
to keep me out of prison?

25:30.120 --> 25:32.725
You know about that?

25:32.760 --> 25:35.092
It was a difficult pill
to swallow,

25:35.130 --> 25:37.621
knowing that my absolution
was paid for,

25:37.670 --> 25:39.797
accepting a literal
get-out-of-jail-free card

25:39.830 --> 25:41.832
for the beating of Oscar Rankin.

25:43.200 --> 25:44.337
Considering the alternative,

25:44.370 --> 25:45.735
I made peace with it.

25:45.770 --> 25:47.169
What I don't understand is

25:47.210 --> 25:49.132
why your father
would tell you what he did.

25:49.180 --> 25:50.909
Both agreed
you didn't need to know.

25:50.950 --> 25:52.599
Well, he never said a word.

25:52.650 --> 25:53.844
Then how did you...?
I've had a lifetime

25:53.880 --> 25:55.609
observing Morland Holmes.

25:55.650 --> 25:57.618
There's little he
can do to surprise me.

25:57.650 --> 26:00.118
Although I must admit,

26:00.150 --> 26:02.289
my grasp of the finer points
of his personality

26:02.320 --> 26:03.924
seem ripe for reconsideration.

26:03.960 --> 26:06.679
What does that mean?

26:06.730 --> 26:08.357
I've been poisoning your opinion
of the man

26:08.400 --> 26:09.753
for the last few years.

26:09.800 --> 26:11.199
Now that he's in our orbit,

26:11.230 --> 26:12.959
perhaps you should draw
your own inferences.

26:19.110 --> 26:21.328
Find something?

26:21.380 --> 26:23.701
Yeah.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.775
See this Sudoku?

26:25.810 --> 26:27.914
The handwriting looks
like a match

26:27.950 --> 26:29.941
for Gagnier's other
little notes to himself.

26:29.980 --> 26:31.743
But the puzzle is filled out
completely wrong.

26:31.790 --> 26:33.212
Not even close.

26:33.250 --> 26:36.117
Ah. Little chance Gagnier
could be this innumerate.

26:36.160 --> 26:38.651
Think it's some sort of code?

26:42.760 --> 26:46.628
I think the last 13
digits are a bank account,

26:46.670 --> 26:50.629
and _the first seven are
a SWIss routing number.

26:53.740 --> 26:57.642
Always wisest to commit
secret accounts to memory.

26:57.680 --> 26:59.648
That's if you want
them to stay secret.

26:59.680 --> 27:01.739
Gagnier should have
taken some ginkgo biloba

27:01.780 --> 27:03.111
and honed his memorization.

27:03.150 --> 27:04.811
Doesn't much matter now.

27:04.850 --> 27:06.283
If that's a Swiss bank account,

27:06.320 --> 27:07.753
everything about it
stays secret.

27:07.790 --> 27:09.678
You're right, and you're wrong.

27:09.720 --> 27:11.688
Bankers in Geneva wouldn't
bend their privacy rules

27:11.730 --> 27:14.699
for American law enforcement,
but for my father's friends...

27:14.730 --> 27:16.652
Seriously?
As I said,

27:16.700 --> 27:19.089
ripe for reconsideration.

27:20.800 --> 27:22.768
Just to be clear, Morland,

27:22.800 --> 27:25.030
nobody here at Interpol knows
what I've done.

27:25.070 --> 27:27.732
You certainly did not get that
from me.

27:27.780 --> 27:30.305
Well, if you can trust us
to keep that under our hats,

27:30.340 --> 27:32.672
why not trust us
with these redacted bits?

27:32.710 --> 27:34.814
Without the authorizing
signatures,

27:34.850 --> 27:37.739
this report is less
revealing than we'd hoped.

27:37.790 --> 27:38.984
Credit Suisse has their limits.

27:39.020 --> 27:40.681
I pushed as hard as I was able.

27:40.720 --> 27:42.813
You have what they gave me.

27:42.860 --> 27:44.782
As you can see, YJN Incorporated

27:44.830 --> 27:48.095
sent Gagnier $750,000 American
last week--

27:48.130 --> 27:50.325
the initial deposit
to open the account.

27:50.360 --> 27:53.261
Another $750,000
hit the wire yesterday.

27:53.300 --> 27:55.894
An hour after Bova and three
others were confirmed dead.

27:55.940 --> 27:57.828
MORLAND:
The shooter won't
be the only one

27:57.870 --> 28:00.338
well-compensated
for getting the job done.

28:00.370 --> 28:03.771
Truly above and beyond
this time, Agent Muller.

28:03.810 --> 28:06.108
I-I went a bit further,
actually.

28:06.150 --> 28:08.948
Looked into this YJN company
for you.

28:08.980 --> 28:10.948
It is, of course,
a shell entity.

28:10.990 --> 28:13.788
It turns out to be
a wholly owned subsidiary

28:13.820 --> 28:15.481
of Dynastic Energy.

28:15.520 --> 28:18.819
Oh, that's interesting.

28:18.860 --> 28:22.819
You have our thanks and
our deepest confidence, Lukas.

28:22.860 --> 28:23.929
(beep)

28:23.970 --> 28:27.326
What do I not know
about Dynastic Energy?

28:27.370 --> 28:29.258
You didn't tell her?

28:29.300 --> 28:31.507
Didn't seem relevant when I
relayed our progress yesterday.

28:31.540 --> 28:33.735
Had a bit of a false
start at Dynastic,

28:33.780 --> 28:35.372
although we didn't
realize it at the time.

28:35.410 --> 28:36.968
All the executives we
spoke to were qUIte happy

28:37.010 --> 28:38.443
to answer our questions,

28:38.480 --> 28:40.448
but we were asking
about the wrong target.

28:40.480 --> 28:42.744
Mm, there can't be more
than a dozen people there

28:42.780 --> 28:44.509
that can_ funnel funds
in this manner.

28:44.550 --> 28:48.179
Imagine one of them won't like
hearing the name "Frank Bova."

28:56.160 --> 28:57.889
So, uh...

28:57.930 --> 28:59.795
what's all this about?

28:59.830 --> 29:01.866
Told you on the phone,
I gave you everything

29:01.900 --> 29:02.969
that we had on Ethan Parris.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.467
And now I'm sitting in what?

29:04.510 --> 29:06.535
What do you call this room?
Is this the box?

29:06.570 --> 29:07.969
We call it "Interview One."

29:08.010 --> 29:09.875
It's just a good,
quiet place to talk.

29:09.910 --> 29:12.470
Okay. Maybe I've just seen
too many movies.

29:12.510 --> 29:15.877
Perhaps that's how you became
so desensitized to violence.

29:15.920 --> 29:19.913
I think you ought to tell me
what this is right now.

29:19.950 --> 29:22.259
I guess I'd say
it's the end of the line.

29:22.290 --> 29:23.826
It's your last chance

29:23.860 --> 29:25.555
to start making this easier
for yourself.

29:25.590 --> 29:28.229
HOLMES: When my father and I
visited with you yesterday,

29:28.260 --> 29:30.558
we knew only the
method of the madness

29:30.600 --> 29:32.488
in Mannahatta Park,
not the target.

29:32.530 --> 29:35.294
Nor the author
of the attack.

29:35.340 --> 29:39.834
You paid a French sniper
with Dynastic Energy funds

29:39.870 --> 29:43.101
to kill Frank Bova in a manner
which would conceal your motive.

29:43.140 --> 29:46.143
Oh, and-and what exactly
was my motive?

29:46.180 --> 29:48.569
WATSON: Jealousy,
Mr. Fitzgerald.

29:48.620 --> 29:51.942
It's as simple as
the crime was complex.

29:51.990 --> 29:54.083
We found the tracking
sobeare the sniper put

29:54.120 --> 29:55.883
on Mr. Bova's phone.

29:55.920 --> 29:58.480
It helped him find
a target-rich environment

29:58.530 --> 30:00.589
with which
to mask the ill intent

30:00.630 --> 30:02.848
of a cuckolded husband.

30:04.130 --> 30:05.961
And that would be me?

30:06.000 --> 30:07.968
The tracking software
he mentioned--

30:08.000 --> 30:09.592
it shows Bova going
to a motor lodge

30:09.640 --> 30:11.335
out near your place
in Westchester

30:11.370 --> 30:12.860
a couple times last week.

30:12.910 --> 30:14.309
WATSON:
He went there to meet

30:14.340 --> 30:15.898
your wife.

30:15.940 --> 30:17.373
Seems they really hit it off

30:17.410 --> 30:20.846
after he renovated your bathroom
a couple of months ago.

30:20.880 --> 30:23.986
Been hitting it off every few
days ever since, matter of fact.

30:24.020 --> 30:25.214
That's not true.

30:25.250 --> 30:27.184
I mean, yes,
this guy worked at our house,

30:27.220 --> 30:29.051
but that's just a coincidence,
that's nothing.

30:29.090 --> 30:30.887
The rest is you
slandering my wife,

30:30.930 --> 30:32.124
and you're coming damn close

30:32.160 --> 30:33.627
to being named
in a defamation lawsuit.

30:33.660 --> 30:35.525
I'm sorry,
Mr. Fitzgerald,

30:35.560 --> 30:39.860
but defamation only applies
to statements that aren't true.

30:49.210 --> 30:51.178
I'm gonna kill her.

30:51.210 --> 30:53.007
What was that?
I'm gonna kill her.

30:53.050 --> 30:54.517
Hey, you can't be
threatening people in here.

30:54.550 --> 30:56.643
Sit down!
No! You don't get
to tell me what to do.

30:56.680 --> 30:59.513
You don't get to show me this
and then tell me what to do.

30:59.550 --> 31:01.654
I'm gonna kill the bitch.
I'm gonna kill her.

31:01.690 --> 31:03.658
I'm fine. I'm gonna... Okay,
you do not need to touch me.

31:03.690 --> 31:05.328
If that's an act,
he's one hell of a liar.

31:05.360 --> 31:07.089
He's a highly paid lavwer.

31:07.130 --> 31:08.552
It would be remarkable if
he wasn't a skilled liar.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.921
Well, if he did it,
we need him to say he did it.

31:10.970 --> 31:12.323
I don't see a judge letting

31:12.370 --> 31:13.962
that redacted bank paperwork
into trial. Do you?

31:14.000 --> 31:16.389
I mean, we can't explain
how he got it.
Not yet.

31:16.440 --> 31:18.931
It'll be simpler once Dynastic
opens their books to us.

31:18.970 --> 31:20.631
Why would they do that?

31:20.670 --> 31:22.069
Honestly, I don't think

31:22.110 --> 31:24.476
my father is gonna
give them much choice.

31:27.980 --> 31:31.939
All right, just get it to me
before Tolqo opens.

31:31.990 --> 31:34.083
And let's get Grant Felgner
on the line

31:34.120 --> 31:35.951
before I'm out of here tonight.

31:35.990 --> 31:37.480
WOMAN:
Absolutely, but first, sir,

31:37.520 --> 31:39.249
Morland Holmes has come
to see you.

31:39.290 --> 31:40.928
Ah. All right, send him in.

31:40.960 --> 31:43.690
(door opens)

31:43.730 --> 31:46.995
Morland.
What brings you back?

31:49.640 --> 31:52.200
I'm sure you're trying to get
home to Lisa and the children,

31:52.240 --> 31:55.539
so I'll be direct. My son
and I have found a paper trail

31:55.580 --> 31:58.208
between the sniper
and YJN Incorporated,

31:58.250 --> 32:00.206
one of your firm's tax havens.

32:00.250 --> 32:02.047
I know what it is.

32:02.080 --> 32:04.048
What are you
trying to tell me here?

32:04.090 --> 32:08.049
We believe that Joel Fitzgerald
authorized the transaction.

32:08.090 --> 32:10.957
His wife was sleeping with
one of the shooting victims.

32:16.500 --> 32:18.365
What do they have on him?

32:18.400 --> 32:20.288
Not quite enough at the moment.

32:20.330 --> 32:24.107
But if you would
cooperate with the NYPD

32:24.140 --> 32:26.005
and provide the wiring paperwork

32:26.040 --> 32:28.008
that shows his signature, well,

32:28.040 --> 32:29.974
I'm sure you'll weather
the storm just fine.

32:30.010 --> 32:33.605
No, I'm sorry, I'm not
gonna do that to his family.

32:33.650 --> 32:36.141
We'll handle it internally.
He'll step down.

32:36.180 --> 32:38.114
Four people are dead, Bill.

32:38.150 --> 32:40.141
Five more were maimed.

32:40.190 --> 32:43.409
And that's a tragedy, but I'm
not going to inflict another one

32:43.460 --> 32:46.452
on his wife and kids,
not if I don't have to.

32:46.490 --> 32:49.994
You're right. The police
do lack the leverage

32:50.030 --> 32:52.169
to compel a full
financial disclosure.

32:52.200 --> 32:53.758
But as I said
the other day,

32:53.800 --> 32:55.665
I do possess that leverage.

32:55.700 --> 32:58.009
That is, if you still
want to build

32:58.040 --> 32:59.769
a $2 billion dam in Peru.

32:59.810 --> 33:02.335
If that's the way
it's gonna be, then so be it.

33:02.380 --> 33:05.099
You call whoever you want.
I'm gonna protect my people.

33:05.150 --> 33:08.074
And I don't like being
threatened in my office.

33:12.620 --> 33:15.783
You're not worried
about Joel Fitzgerald.

33:15.820 --> 33:18.027
You're worried about yourself.

33:20.090 --> 33:22.524
You would never let
a ten-figure deal evaporate

33:22.560 --> 33:25.723
to spare a lawyer on your staff.

33:25.770 --> 33:28.330
But to keep yourself
out of prison,

33:28.370 --> 33:32.067
no price
would be too high.

33:32.110 --> 33:34.305
You hired the sniper yourself.

33:35.810 --> 33:37.368
Why would I do that?

33:37.410 --> 33:40.106
Well, I've heard rumors.
We all have.

33:40.150 --> 33:43.369
You make a sport of pursuing
your employees' wives.

33:43.420 --> 33:46.082
It's... unseemly.

33:46.120 --> 33:49.055
But not altogether uncommon.

33:49.090 --> 33:51.581
But it's certainly
put you on the spot here.

33:51.630 --> 33:54.258
What do you want?

33:55.730 --> 33:57.618
This is a shakedown, isn't it?

33:57.660 --> 33:59.389
'Cause you don't
have any proof.

33:59.430 --> 34:00.522
You're not gonna dig any up.

34:00.570 --> 34:01.764
You just have
this story

34:01.800 --> 34:03.165
that you want me
to hear that you

34:03.200 --> 34:04.303
pulled out of
your quiver.

34:04.340 --> 34:06.331
And it's a good one,

34:06.370 --> 34:08.235
but what do you want?

34:11.850 --> 34:13.841
you want to pair us up
with somebody in Ukraine?

34:13.880 --> 34:15.848
Because you can forget
about us pulling back

34:15.880 --> 34:18.144
in the Jordan Valley.

34:18.190 --> 34:20.146
Oh, I'm sure
I'll do plenty of business

34:20.190 --> 34:23.557
with Dynastic Energy
in the future, Bill.

34:23.590 --> 34:26.787
But I'd prefer to wait until
there's someone I can trust

34:26.830 --> 34:30.129
in this office.

34:30.160 --> 34:32.162
It won't be long.

34:38.310 --> 34:40.266
When I first met Bill Wellstone,
he was working to open

34:40.310 --> 34:41.675
the Tengiz pipeline
in Kazakhstan,

34:41.710 --> 34:43.871
2001.
Even then,

34:43.910 --> 34:45.673
he had a reputation
of hunting prey

34:45.710 --> 34:48.679
close at hand, married or not.

34:48.720 --> 34:50.278
You're suggesting
Joel Fitzgerald's wife

34:50.320 --> 34:51.719
wasn't just cheating on
him with a plumber,

34:51.750 --> 34:53.342
she'd previously had an
affair with his boss.

34:53.390 --> 34:55.415
WATSON:
That's why Fitzgerald

34:55.460 --> 34:56.813
acted the way he did
at the station--

34:56.860 --> 34:58.828
he really didn't know
about his wife.

34:58.860 --> 35:01.249
A cheating spouse is a
time-honored motive.

35:01.300 --> 35:03.450
Cheating mistress,
that's more tenuous.

35:03.500 --> 35:05.821
Fidelity cannot
be expected

35:05.870 --> 35:08.338
if you yourself
are the other man.

35:08.370 --> 35:10.338
Or, in this case, another man.

35:10.370 --> 35:12.338
_ He could've seen her as
his soul mate, for all we know.

35:12.370 --> 35:14.736
If you're right,
she no longer felt the same.

35:14.780 --> 35:17.533
She reconsidered what she wanted
from an extramarital outlet,

35:17.580 --> 35:19.707
moved on from
cuckolding her husband

35:19.750 --> 35:20.671
_ to the more
Visceral enjoyment

35:20.710 --> 35:23.349
of bedding a blue-collar stud.

35:23.380 --> 35:24.745
Enter Frank Bova.

35:24.790 --> 35:27.384
Literally.

35:29.790 --> 35:31.849
You think we'd be better off
starting fresh in the morning?

35:31.890 --> 35:33.289
Men require

35:33.330 --> 35:35.525
less sleep than women.

35:35.560 --> 35:36.697
That's generally true.

35:36.730 --> 35:38.766
We use more of our brains
during the day.

35:38.800 --> 35:41.837
But I didn't think you'd assume
that applied to you.

35:41.870 --> 35:44.759
Sherlock, you've been up since
the second day of our last case.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.732
I'll rest easier
when I discover the moment

35:46.770 --> 35:49.568
the sniper rifle
was smuggled into the building.

35:49.610 --> 35:51.441
If Gagnier used an accomplice
to plant the gun,

35:51.480 --> 35:53.539
do you really think that
person's gonna tell us something

35:53.580 --> 35:55.411
that we can use
against Wellstone?

35:55.450 --> 35:56.872
It's a long shot
that such a person

35:56.920 --> 35:58.444
would know of Wellstone's
involvement.

35:58.490 --> 36:01.584
It's a long shot that
person exists at all.

36:01.620 --> 36:03.918
But I'm almost certain
that they do.

36:03.960 --> 36:05.689
I've almost finished
rewinding the tape

36:05.730 --> 36:08.358
from the moment Gagnier
entered the building to the day

36:08.400 --> 36:11.927
that Frank Bova's
lunch routine became known.

36:11.970 --> 36:15.895
It does not appear that he
himself set foot in the building

36:15.940 --> 36:18.408
before the day of the attack.

36:18.440 --> 36:20.738
But he could have shipped the
gun to someone in the building.

36:20.770 --> 36:22.829
That would have
been extremely risky.

36:22.880 --> 36:26.202
There was once an anthrax scare
at 46 Liberty Square.

36:26.250 --> 36:28.775
_ Their mailroom
is tight as a drum.

36:28.820 --> 36:32.916
And yet someone...

36:32.950 --> 36:36.488
smuggled this gun
and these bullets

36:36.520 --> 36:38.784
past the metal detectors
in the lobby.

36:46.630 --> 36:50.896
Watson, I'm either hallucinating
from lack of REM sleep,

36:50.940 --> 36:53.261
or that is a blade of grass.

36:56.580 --> 36:58.901
You're not seeing things.

36:58.950 --> 37:01.441
Would you say
that was velvet bentgrass?

37:01.480 --> 37:02.947
That I couldn't tell you.

37:02.980 --> 37:05.346
Velvet bentgrass, not
a particularly hearty variety.

37:05.390 --> 37:09.315
It requires moist, fertile soil,
near constant watering.

37:09.360 --> 37:11.783
And yet it remains a favorite

37:11.830 --> 37:14.253
of golf course designers

37:14.300 --> 37:15.927
throughout
the Northeast.

37:15.960 --> 37:18.326
So maybe Gagnier was a golfer.

37:18.370 --> 37:21.294
Him... or his accomplice.

37:22.970 --> 37:25.268
That's you on the right,
is it not, Mr. Wellstone?

37:25.310 --> 37:27.460
And please confirm that
you see the time there--

37:27.510 --> 37:29.933
12:09 pm. on the day
of the attack.

37:29.980 --> 37:31.868
We can all see
that's Mr. Wellstone.

37:31.910 --> 37:33.969
And I assume we all know
how to read clocks.

37:34.010 --> 37:36.274
If you have substantive
questions, ask them.

37:36.320 --> 37:37.912
Unless you just
wanted us to watch him

37:37.950 --> 37:39.941
walking around
with a golf bag.

37:39.990 --> 37:43.380
He's not playing
the back nine at Bethpage.

37:43.420 --> 37:44.853
That's your client
smuggling

37:44.890 --> 37:48.849
a Nemesis Takedown rifle
into 46 Liberty Square.

37:48.900 --> 37:49.924
20 minutes later,

37:49.960 --> 37:51.996
the sniper he hired

37:52.030 --> 37:54.464
used the same gun
to shoot nine people.

37:54.500 --> 37:55.797
Hold on.
You're alleging my client...

37:55.840 --> 37:56.829
Conspiracy, murder,

37:56.870 --> 37:58.565
and aiding and abetting.

37:58.610 --> 37:59.861
Don't worry, we'll provide
some helpful

37:59.910 --> 38:01.468
charging documents
when we're done here.

38:01.510 --> 38:03.034
WATSON:
Someone had to
have left the gun

38:03.080 --> 38:05.947
for Gagnier before he arrived
the day of the shooting,

38:05.980 --> 38:07.709
only that's not what happened.

38:07.750 --> 38:08.978
HOLMES:
It was bold of you

38:09.020 --> 38:10.840
to send him up there
to wait empty-handed.

38:10.880 --> 38:12.984
Especially given
the strictures of the timeline.

38:13.020 --> 38:14.749
But you knew you could
stroll past security

38:14.790 --> 38:17.452
any time you wanted
with your golf buddy,

38:17.490 --> 38:19.651
the building's owner.
GREGSON:
After you wrapped up with him,

38:19.690 --> 38:21.396
you took the elevator
up to the floor

38:21.430 --> 38:22.897
under construction,

38:22.930 --> 38:24.659
you met up with
your other buddy,

38:24.700 --> 38:25.962
and you gave him

38:26.000 --> 38:27.024
everything he needed.

38:27.070 --> 38:29.630
Bill, don't say a word.

38:29.670 --> 38:31.638
HOLMES:
You do a very good job,
Mr. Adler,

38:31.670 --> 38:33.501
but I must warn you
your client is prone

38:33.540 --> 38:35.405
to sleeping
with his lawyer's wives.

38:35.440 --> 38:37.579
Look, that video
doesn't prove anything.

38:37.610 --> 38:39.043
I told you
before:

38:39.080 --> 38:40.502
we're in the_middle
of a negotiation

38:40.550 --> 38:41.949
with Zyckner Williams.

38:41.980 --> 38:44.778
I gave one of their guys
a gift to butter him up.

38:44.820 --> 38:46.412
A pricey new set of clubs.

38:46.450 --> 38:48.350
The deal we're
hammering out--

38:48.390 --> 38:49.687
it's big.

38:49.720 --> 38:51.824
Oh, it's quite massive,
actually.

38:51.860 --> 38:54.078
That's one of the reasons your
adversaries at Zyckner Williams

38:54.130 --> 38:55.791
were willing to assist us.

38:55.830 --> 38:57.491
Helping
expose you

38:57.530 --> 38:59.919
gives them leverage
over Dynastic Energies,

38:59.970 --> 39:01.961
so they gave us the golf bag
without a warrant.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.536
GREGSON:
It's been in the office

39:03.570 --> 39:06.004
of a vacationing partner
all this time.

39:06.040 --> 39:07.598
WATSON:
The Nemesis rifle

39:07.640 --> 39:09.005
was way too big to fit in there

39:09.040 --> 39:10.576
with all the other clubs.

39:10.610 --> 39:12.441
Gagnier had to disassemble it
to get it to fit.

39:12.480 --> 39:14.675
If he hadn't,
security might have seen it.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.915
But because he did,
he smeared gun oil

39:16.950 --> 39:18.918
against the inside of the bag.

39:18.950 --> 39:21.612
There were traces
that matched the rifle he used.

39:21.660 --> 39:24.879
Zyckner Williams has possessed
that bag for how long?

39:24.930 --> 39:26.989
Wh-Who's to say they...
Who's to say
they didn't dab gun oil

39:27.030 --> 39:28.793
inside of it_
to frame your client?

39:28.830 --> 39:30.422
You can
try that at trial,

39:30.460 --> 39:31.927
I guess.

39:31.970 --> 39:33.926
But you're gonna have
a lot harder time

39:33.970 --> 39:36.791
countering
Sarah Fitzgerald's testimony.

39:36.840 --> 39:39.604
WATSON:
Now that her husband
is leaving her

39:39.640 --> 39:41.062
and you killed
her new boyfriend,

39:41.110 --> 39:43.431
she's ready to talk
about your affair.

39:43.480 --> 39:45.539
You thought you were angry
about the breakup.

39:45.580 --> 39:47.673
Just wait till
she takes the stand.

39:58.930 --> 40:00.181
Lukas.

40:00.230 --> 40:02.198
I hope you don't mind--
I started without you

40:02.230 --> 40:04.118
when I heard the flight
was delayed.

40:04.160 --> 40:05.821
It's fine.

40:05.870 --> 40:08.896
Have the place
to ourselves, I see.

40:08.940 --> 40:10.896
So...

40:10.940 --> 40:14.137
what's so important that you had
to cross an ocean to discuss?

40:14.170 --> 40:16.934
Five million euros, Morland.

40:18.110 --> 40:20.670
That's what I want you
to pay me.

40:20.710 --> 40:23.679
I'm afraid I don't understand.

40:23.720 --> 40:26.484
Do you think I don't really
know what's going on?

40:26.520 --> 40:28.852
This business with your son--

40:28.890 --> 40:31.654
do you expect me to believe
you're here to help him?

40:31.690 --> 40:33.920
Five million euros.

40:33.960 --> 40:36.952
Or I pay him a visit.
And I warn him of the danger.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.527
There is no danger, Lukas.

40:40.570 --> 40:43.789
So you won't mind
if I speak with him?

40:43.840 --> 40:46.707
Did you know you had
a predecessor, Lukas?

40:46.740 --> 40:49.106
At Interpol.

40:49.140 --> 40:51.005
Another friend of mine.

40:51.040 --> 40:54.840
Someone I could turn to
when I needed assistance.

40:54.880 --> 40:57.644
His name
was Jasper De Clerq.

41:01.220 --> 41:04.781
We had a long
and prosperous relationship.

41:04.830 --> 41:06.923
Until one day, he decided

41:06.960 --> 41:09.554
it wasn't quite
prosperous enough.

41:10.760 --> 41:12.967
My God, Morland.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.468
His children found him.

41:16.300 --> 41:18.234
They were meant to.

41:21.110 --> 41:23.670
Tell me, Lukas...
how are your daughters?

41:29.620 --> 41:31.918
Go back to Paris.

41:31.950 --> 41:34.145
Go back tonight.

41:34.190 --> 41:36.158
And both of us will forget

41:36.190 --> 41:38.181
_we ever had
this conversation.

41:41.260 --> 41:44.798
I'm sorry, Morland.
I'm very sorry.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.991
Lukas.

41:50.700 --> 41:52.839
Call me Mr. Holmes.
