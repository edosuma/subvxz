WEBVTT

00:16.934 --> 00:18.017
Our latest compound.

00:18.727 --> 00:21.270
It was hard to mass-produce
on such short notice...

00:21.438 --> 00:23.272
...but I think we finally got it.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.358
Let me be the judge of that.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.912
It's an organophosphate pesticide.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.539
Similar to VX gas.

00:40.124 --> 00:41.624
Kills everything it touches.

00:59.309 --> 01:01.436
And that should do it.

01:09.403 --> 01:12.113
Exactly how many barrels
do you need?

01:15.159 --> 01:16.242
All of them.

01:38.474 --> 01:41.225
You're a natural with that baby.

01:41.852 --> 01:44.353
You'll be the father he needs.

01:46.023 --> 01:48.316
I don't know anything
about being a parent.

01:48.484 --> 01:50.318
You don't need to.

01:50.486 --> 01:51.652
You're a born leader.

01:57.618 --> 02:00.119
You'll help us to rebuild.

02:00.788 --> 02:05.082
To fill this room with the sounds
of children once again.

02:08.879 --> 02:10.421
He needs a name.

02:13.008 --> 02:14.717
I hadn't even thought of that.

02:15.385 --> 02:17.386
We can choose a name later.

02:19.598 --> 02:21.974
Right now, we have a job to do.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.435
Loose ends that need to be tied up.

02:26.772 --> 02:28.064
Loose ends?

02:28.398 --> 02:30.733
The skeptics, of course.

02:30.901 --> 02:33.778
If we're going to rebuild,
there can be no interference.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.448
We can easily expel them
from the Abbey.

02:38.617 --> 02:40.618
If you think that's best.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.162
You don't?

02:44.331 --> 02:47.792
I'm worried they might expose us.
Can we afford to take that risk?

02:48.418 --> 02:50.461
Sarah would leave.

02:50.629 --> 02:53.005
Probably Kyle too.

02:54.424 --> 02:56.092
But Alan....

02:56.260 --> 02:59.428
He's like a dog with a bone.
He'd never leave us in peace.

03:01.515 --> 03:04.684
I will stand behind
any decision you make.

03:15.112 --> 03:17.321
None of them can leave the island.

03:17.489 --> 03:19.574
Not even your brother?

03:20.242 --> 03:22.952
Especially not my brother.

03:25.497 --> 03:28.457
Exactly how are you going
to get a baby inside of me?

03:29.209 --> 03:30.918
With this.

03:31.086 --> 03:32.169
What is it?

03:32.337 --> 03:34.964
An artificial umbilical cord
and placenta.

03:35.132 --> 03:37.550
It will allow us to implant
Jordan's baby into you.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.887
-And then I'll be like my father?
-Not yet.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.848
Your body's not ready to carry a baby.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.522
Well, get on with it.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.650
Sorry.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.487
We'll need to raise your estrogen
and progesterone levels...

03:58.655 --> 04:00.865
...so we can be sure
the implant will take.

04:04.369 --> 04:05.578
Is this really necessary?

04:06.246 --> 04:09.498
The sap is holding off the Mycosis,
but you're still plenty sick.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.376
How are you going to do that?

04:12.544 --> 04:17.340
It's not as though we have barrels
of estrogen lying around.

04:17.507 --> 04:20.051
You do have livestock.

04:20.218 --> 04:21.928
A gradual course
of bovine hormones...

04:22.095 --> 04:25.973
...should shock your body into creating
the proper environment for the fetus.

04:28.644 --> 04:31.270
-When can I go see my mom?
-We'll find her for you.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.649
But we need to do some tests.
Figure out why you got better.

04:34.816 --> 04:37.401
-Think you can help us with that?
-Sure.

04:37.569 --> 04:39.362
When do I become immortal?

04:42.532 --> 04:45.868
Once your system begins to react
to the baby's immortal blood...

04:46.036 --> 04:48.079
...you should absorb
the genetic materials...

04:48.246 --> 04:50.998
...that kept it in stasis for 15 months.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.335
Now that you got that sap,
we gotta leave.

04:54.503 --> 04:58.881
I need to distill it first into a concentrate
for Kyle and anyone else who is sick.

04:59.049 --> 05:02.343
You can do that once we're off the island.
I'm calling in an evac.

05:02.511 --> 05:04.637
Seal that perimeter.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.849
Dr. Farragut?

05:12.604 --> 05:15.106
Take Soren to the Octagon.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.165
Alan.

05:38.839 --> 05:39.922
Jules.

05:40.632 --> 05:42.049
What are you doing here?

05:44.803 --> 05:46.345
Looking for you.

05:46.888 --> 05:49.974
But you've been busy
with your new friends at Ilaria.

05:50.142 --> 05:52.977
The same friends
you've been stalking and killing?

05:55.689 --> 05:58.399
I searched everywhere for you.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.777
I burned down every Ilaria stronghold
I could find.

06:01.945 --> 06:07.783
-I never asked you to do that.
-The last thing you said was, "Find me."

06:11.204 --> 06:12.288
You're right.

06:12.456 --> 06:15.207
Things are different now. Listen, Alan.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.586
Ilaria is planning to release
a new version of Narvik worldwide.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.798
-When?
-Two days.

06:22.966 --> 06:25.134
Unless I can give them
a viable alternative.

06:25.844 --> 06:26.886
To genocide?

06:27.054 --> 06:28.846
The compound in Michael's apple.

06:29.014 --> 06:31.766
-It's the only option they'll consider.
-That's the plan?

06:31.933 --> 06:34.727
Slow death of the human race,
as opposed to all at once.

06:34.895 --> 06:38.230
We'd control the output. Limit
the population without extermination.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.275
Spoken like Hatake's daughter.

06:42.152 --> 06:45.321
I am Hatake's daughter.
It's either this or Narvik.

06:45.489 --> 06:48.449
So help me or get out of my way,
but don't interfere.

06:49.534 --> 06:51.410
Or what, Jules?

06:52.037 --> 06:53.287
What are you gonna do?

06:54.664 --> 06:57.792
What happened to the woman
I fell in love with?

06:58.293 --> 07:00.836
She became immortal.

07:13.809 --> 07:15.059
What happened to these two?

07:15.227 --> 07:16.894
I don't ask questions.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.314
Amy said to take care of the bodies.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.400
Good riddance for this one.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.529
I never liked him much.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.252
They said you were dead.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.334
It's too far to jump.

08:23.587 --> 08:28.924
And even if you didn't break your legs
in the fall, where would you go?

08:29.092 --> 08:32.553
-As far away from here as I could.
-There's no running away from here.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.183
Could you give us a minute?

08:37.350 --> 08:39.643
Amy told me to keep an eye on her.

08:39.811 --> 08:43.397
And I'm telling you
she's not a prisoner.

08:43.565 --> 08:45.441
Now leave us.

08:53.950 --> 08:56.160
Sorry, Sarah.
I didn't mean for this to happen.

08:56.328 --> 08:59.496
Save your apology, Julia.
I'm not letting you give my child to Amy.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.373
If I don't, she won't give me Mother.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.500
Without the root, I can't stop Ilaria.

09:03.668 --> 09:06.795
And the only option is using
the child that I made with Alan?

09:11.843 --> 09:13.510
You have to trust me.

09:14.429 --> 09:17.431
This is the only way we can save
the world and your baby.

09:17.599 --> 09:19.642
By putting him inside that psychopath?

09:19.809 --> 09:21.602
The fetus stopped growing inside you.

09:21.770 --> 09:26.190
Maybe gestating inside a mortal
will allow it to grow again.

09:27.150 --> 09:30.986
If we try this,
we give your baby a chance to live.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.079
Watch his legs.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.087
Make sure he can't hurt himself.
He's still CDC.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.422
-Yes, ma'am.
-This isn't necessary. I'm fine.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.174
We have a new problem.

09:52.342 --> 09:55.386
Because we're doing such a good job
handling the old one?

09:56.388 --> 09:58.389
There's gonna be
a new Narvik outbreak.

09:59.391 --> 10:00.766
-What?
-In two days' time.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.559
You need to contact your superiors.

10:02.727 --> 10:05.437
I've been trying.
I'm not getting any response.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.857
-Are their comm links down?
-That would never happen.

10:09.401 --> 10:10.859
Unless....

10:11.027 --> 10:12.653
What?

10:13.738 --> 10:15.531
I need to make visual contact.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.543
Oh, my God.

10:32.257 --> 10:33.340
What?

10:33.508 --> 10:37.011
-What am I looking at? A rescue?
-Just the opposite.

10:37.721 --> 10:39.805
They're gonna kill everything.

10:48.189 --> 10:50.316
What the hell is going on?

10:51.484 --> 10:53.610
Why are those ships out there?

10:53.778 --> 10:56.697
After the first attacks,
the military enacted new protocols...

10:56.865 --> 10:58.949
...to deal with infectious disease.

10:59.117 --> 11:02.036
Anything with an R-naught over eight
is met with a response.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.287
Plan A is containment.

11:03.455 --> 11:06.707
-Well, isn't that what you came to do?
-And we thought we succeeded.

11:06.875 --> 11:08.959
But now that the pathogen
has hit our ships...

11:09.127 --> 11:11.211
...they must have decided
to implement Plan B.

11:11.379 --> 11:12.671
Which is what?

11:12.839 --> 11:14.631
Eradication.

11:14.799 --> 11:17.968
Aerial spraying
with an organophosphate pesticide.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.722
They're gonna kill everything
on the island.

11:21.890 --> 11:24.683
-You knew this was coming?
-We should have been gone by now.

11:30.231 --> 11:33.776
-What are you doing?
-Preparing for an evacuation.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.319
You don't understand.

11:35.487 --> 11:37.780
Plan B involves killing all life
on this island.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.531
There is no evac.

11:39.699 --> 11:43.160
You need to call on a different frequency,
tell them there are people here.

11:43.328 --> 11:46.997
The protocol assumes everyone has been
exposed and the pathogen is untreatable.

11:47.165 --> 11:50.542
Communications are jammed
to avoid rescuing any infected...

11:50.710 --> 11:54.880
...who could spread the disease.
Dr. Farragut, we're dead.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.805
Not if I can synthesize a cure.

12:02.972 --> 12:06.225
We don't have time. The planes
will be coming in to spray at sunset.

12:06.393 --> 12:09.269
Then we have roughly six hours.

12:09.437 --> 12:13.107
You send your team out there, have them
find us a secure place to hunker down...

12:13.274 --> 12:15.275
...when they start spraying.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.653
And if I can make
this concentrated sap work...

12:17.821 --> 12:21.365
...we'll hail the Navy somehow
and negotiate our way out.

12:28.790 --> 12:29.873
Hello, doctor.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.505
I need to speak to Sommer.

12:36.673 --> 12:38.841
We've been given orders
to keep him isolated.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.677
He works for the CDC
and is under my command...

12:41.845 --> 12:45.806
...so unless you want to take this up
with the inspector general, step aside.

12:50.687 --> 12:52.855
You've got two minutes.

12:53.398 --> 12:54.565
Thank you.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.031
Thank you, lieutenant.

13:09.372 --> 13:10.831
How you doing, Kyle?

13:10.999 --> 13:12.708
Never felt better.

13:12.876 --> 13:14.334
That's good.

13:16.921 --> 13:21.341
I wouldn't want anything else to happen
to you while you're here on assignment.

13:21.509 --> 13:25.554
The attacks, the illness.

13:25.722 --> 13:28.599
You've had some pretty bad luck
since you got here.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.143
Guess so.

13:31.311 --> 13:35.272
But I guess we both know
it's not really bad luck, right?

13:36.107 --> 13:37.524
We know who's responsible.

13:38.776 --> 13:39.818
Responsible?

13:39.986 --> 13:42.237
For all the bad things
that have happened to you.

13:42.405 --> 13:43.906
To me.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.199
To Sarah.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.161
It's Alan.

13:50.455 --> 13:53.373
He's the one behind all our troubles.

13:53.541 --> 13:54.833
He is?

13:55.543 --> 13:58.921
Someone needs to stop him
before it's too late.

14:05.678 --> 14:06.887
I could stop him.

14:08.306 --> 14:10.641
That's why they sent me here.

14:11.142 --> 14:13.143
Of course you can.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.563
If you weren't tied up in here.

14:25.740 --> 14:29.910
Why don't we just keep this
between us, yeah?

14:36.209 --> 14:38.377
Thank you, Dr. Sommer.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.686
Have you heard?

14:55.853 --> 14:58.522
You're going to be a grandmother.

15:00.692 --> 15:03.402
Why are you doing this, Amy?

15:04.946 --> 15:07.656
I'm giving your life purpose.

15:09.367 --> 15:10.826
You should be thanking me.

15:10.994 --> 15:13.495
What's that supposed to mean?

15:14.998 --> 15:17.124
You always needed someone
to worship.

15:17.292 --> 15:20.419
When Ilaria finishes
making me immortal like Father...

15:20.587 --> 15:23.589
...you can bow before me.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.299
You think that's what I want?

15:25.466 --> 15:29.636
For you to be immortal?
Nothing could be farther from the truth.

15:31.055 --> 15:32.347
Oh, right.

15:32.515 --> 15:34.349
You're still mad
that I'm in charge now?

15:34.517 --> 15:35.934
I'm not mad.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.353
Maybe that's your problem.

15:38.521 --> 15:41.481
Don't you ever wanna get really angry?

15:41.649 --> 15:43.734
Scream at someone?

15:44.444 --> 15:47.195
-Hit them in the face?
-I don't have a problem.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.615
I'm just giving you a chance
to apologize.

15:56.581 --> 15:58.498
Apologize?

16:00.752 --> 16:03.211
-For what?
-You've hurt a great many people.

16:04.881 --> 16:07.299
I hope one day you'll realize...

16:07.467 --> 16:10.802
...how your actions have ruined
the lives of others.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.931
And I hope
you'll come off your high horse.

16:15.808 --> 16:19.686
If I wanted counseling,
I'd go to Michael.

16:21.105 --> 16:22.939
Too late for that now.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.450
Just remember...

16:33.618 --> 16:35.911
...I gave you a chance.

16:50.259 --> 16:51.385
Sergio.

16:52.428 --> 16:53.512
What happened?

16:54.430 --> 16:55.972
One of the followers found him.

16:56.140 --> 16:59.142
-I thought you should know.
-Balleseros was a trained mercenary.

16:59.310 --> 17:02.646
-Who here could have done this to him?
-I'm sure Amy was behind this.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.025
You're probably right.

17:07.735 --> 17:10.612
She still has what I need.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.370
What are you looking for?

17:19.997 --> 17:20.997
This.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.461
Why don't we take the root from Amy?

17:26.629 --> 17:29.756
She has it hidden. We have
to go through with the procedure.

17:33.594 --> 17:36.138
Fine. I'm gonna help you.

17:37.098 --> 17:39.558
But this better save my child.

17:43.813 --> 17:45.605
Why do you need to take my blood?

17:45.773 --> 17:49.192
Because blood is everything.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.153
It can tell us all about you.

17:51.320 --> 17:56.533
What makes you the same as others,
what makes you different.

17:56.701 --> 18:00.787
Right now, I'm trying to see...

18:01.748 --> 18:05.709
...why you got better
when others didn't.

18:09.756 --> 18:13.884
My theory is that your blood is unique.

18:14.051 --> 18:16.928
So now I'm gonna analyze it
to see if the data supports that.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.807
Does that mean
that I can make Dr. Kyle better?

18:20.975 --> 18:25.896
Maybe, in combination with the red sap
from the Bleeding Tree.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.526
Just as I thought.

18:33.321 --> 18:34.738
Your blood is very special.

18:34.906 --> 18:39.326
-Really? Can I see?
-Yeah, yeah. Come here.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.625
What does it mean?

18:46.793 --> 18:51.630
It means we might just be able
to manufacture a cure for the Mycosis.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.799
Move.

18:55.009 --> 18:56.259
Can you show me how?

18:57.720 --> 18:59.137
Soren!

18:59.305 --> 19:00.472
Mom.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.433
I thought I'd lost you.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.187
Soren, what happened to your eye?

19:07.355 --> 19:09.105
I'm okay now.

19:09.273 --> 19:13.652
Dr. Kyle and Jerome-- I mean, Alan.
--they brought me home.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.070
They saved me.

19:15.238 --> 19:17.572
He was very brave.

19:18.407 --> 19:19.908
I owe you.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.327
And Michael always told us
to pay our debts.

19:22.495 --> 19:26.873
Mom, he's gonna show me
how to make the cure.

19:32.797 --> 19:33.964
Dr. Sommer.

19:38.052 --> 19:39.761
Time to eat.

19:55.653 --> 19:57.571
Help me.

20:02.285 --> 20:03.910
Help me.

20:09.500 --> 20:12.002
I'm sorry, Lieutenant Humphries...

20:12.169 --> 20:14.588
...but your path ends here.

20:59.508 --> 21:00.800
Peter?

21:07.892 --> 21:09.309
What happened?

21:09.477 --> 21:10.894
Is the baby hurt?

21:11.854 --> 21:14.648
No. He's fine.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.984
Not a scratch on him.

21:18.152 --> 21:19.736
And you?

21:22.073 --> 21:23.740
I'm good.

21:24.909 --> 21:26.201
Really good.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.704
Yeah.

21:34.210 --> 21:36.086
So it's done?

21:38.923 --> 21:40.966
Just like we talked about.

21:41.258 --> 21:44.177
Did anyone see you?
We have to be careful.

21:46.222 --> 21:48.640
I think he smiled at me.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.518
Did you see that? He smiled.

21:56.774 --> 21:58.233
Now it's your turn.

21:58.401 --> 21:59.985
Are you ready?

22:00.152 --> 22:02.487
-More than ready.
-Good.

22:02.947 --> 22:05.657
This should be over by nightfall.

22:22.383 --> 22:23.717
Hi.

22:38.983 --> 22:40.275
Remind you of anything?

22:43.279 --> 22:45.613
-Where's Dr. Sommer?
-No one knows.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.657
There were no witnesses.

22:47.825 --> 22:50.201
-This is wrong.
-Tell me about it.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.911
No.

22:53.080 --> 22:55.874
I mean, Mycotics are brutal,
they're clumsy.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.209
They kill from a deep psychosis.

22:58.377 --> 23:01.504
This is surgical. It's precise.

23:03.466 --> 23:05.842
An almost poetic reference to the tree.

23:06.010 --> 23:08.470
So who do you think did it,
Robert Frost?

23:08.637 --> 23:10.472
Has anyone been in here
besides us today?

23:10.639 --> 23:13.349
The other CDC doctor. He was here.

23:14.101 --> 23:15.351
Peter Farragut, my brother?

23:16.395 --> 23:18.063
He wanted to talk to Dr. Sommer.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.856
Came in throwing his weight around.

23:22.443 --> 23:24.069
How long did they spend together?

23:24.236 --> 23:26.404
What are you getting at, Alan?

23:26.572 --> 23:28.364
I don't think Kyle did this.

23:28.532 --> 23:30.033
I am not debating this.

23:30.201 --> 23:33.244
We've got three hours before sunset.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.747
Continue with locking down
the interior.

23:35.915 --> 23:38.541
If you come across Dr. Sommer,
orders are shoot on sight.

23:38.709 --> 23:41.503
-Now wait a minute--
-I am not taking any more chances...

23:41.670 --> 23:44.214
...with the lives of my men.

23:44.381 --> 23:45.715
-Move out.
-Yes, ma'am.

23:52.348 --> 23:53.848
Come on.

24:09.573 --> 24:11.116
Thank you for your sacrifice.

24:12.952 --> 24:16.454
You died to ensure his glory.

24:56.162 --> 24:57.453
Don't worry.

24:58.539 --> 25:01.249
I'll be a good mother.

25:07.423 --> 25:10.091
Soon, the three of us will be sisters.

25:10.759 --> 25:12.510
Just rest now.

25:16.765 --> 25:17.807
It'll be over soon.

25:18.601 --> 25:20.518
Interesting choice of words.

25:22.396 --> 25:26.649
Just remember,
if anything happens to me...

25:28.485 --> 25:31.029
...you'll never find Mother.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.740
I made sure of that.

25:53.385 --> 25:55.220
She's out.

26:10.945 --> 26:12.862
-Don't.
-You don't understand.

26:13.030 --> 26:14.072
It's not your child.

26:14.240 --> 26:17.742
Sarah, I can't let you kill her.

26:19.870 --> 26:21.162
I need you to trust me.

26:42.017 --> 26:43.017
Landry?

26:50.651 --> 26:52.151
Landry?

26:59.410 --> 27:01.160
Landry, my sweet boy.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.748
You can come out.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.709
No one is going to hurt you.

27:18.012 --> 27:19.971
Are you in pain?

27:22.224 --> 27:23.766
Amy.

27:24.393 --> 27:31.190
Your sister is on a dangerous path,
and I fear she has corrupted yours.

27:31.358 --> 27:34.944
Your feelings for her
will be your undoing.

27:38.699 --> 27:41.034
You must break free from the hold
she has over you.

27:41.201 --> 27:42.327
No!

27:46.123 --> 27:47.874
Landry.

27:48.042 --> 27:50.918
Landry. No, please.

27:52.629 --> 27:54.589
Landry, please.

28:06.101 --> 28:07.685
Amy?

28:08.771 --> 28:11.022
Amy, can you hear me?

28:13.067 --> 28:14.734
How do you feel?

28:15.319 --> 28:16.778
Fine.

28:16.945 --> 28:18.446
I....

28:22.034 --> 28:24.786
I don't feel any pain.

28:24.953 --> 28:26.662
Nothing.

28:28.165 --> 28:32.043
You don't feel anything because
the procedure was successful.

28:32.211 --> 28:33.753
You really did it?

28:36.340 --> 28:38.299
See for yourself.

28:55.484 --> 28:57.068
Finally.

29:02.116 --> 29:03.866
I'm immortal.

29:09.706 --> 29:10.998
I'm immortal...

29:12.167 --> 29:14.752
...just like I was always meant to be.

29:29.268 --> 29:30.893
What do you want, Peter?

29:31.520 --> 29:33.187
I want nothing from you, brother.

29:35.399 --> 29:37.775
Well, then maybe you have
a confession to make?

29:37.943 --> 29:40.695
You want a confession?
If the tables were turned...

29:40.863 --> 29:43.281
...I wouldn't have helped you
out of that pit either.

29:43.449 --> 29:45.158
Get out of my way.

29:46.702 --> 29:48.828
I spoke to Julia.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.125
She'd like to see you.

29:54.293 --> 29:56.961
-Are you her errand boy?
-There's been a new development.

29:57.129 --> 29:59.714
-Something about Narvik-C.
-What about it?

30:00.466 --> 30:03.759
She wouldn't tell me. I guess
it's The Jules and Alan Show again...

30:03.927 --> 30:07.096
-...just like old times.
-Spare me, Peter.

30:07.264 --> 30:09.098
You made your own bed.

30:09.266 --> 30:12.226
I said I'd tell you. Go see her,
don't go see her. I don't care.

30:12.394 --> 30:14.520
-Where is she?
-In the botany lab.

30:14.688 --> 30:17.023
-What's she doing there?
-How should I know?

30:17.191 --> 30:18.357
I'm just the errand boy.

30:52.017 --> 30:53.643
Jules?

30:59.816 --> 31:01.359
Jules?

31:21.588 --> 31:23.256
Looks like I got me a big one.

31:45.237 --> 31:47.405
Well, well, well.

31:47.573 --> 31:50.408
-Kyle--
-Don't "Kyle" me.

31:50.576 --> 31:52.201
I'm on to you.

31:52.369 --> 31:56.289
Took me a while to figure it out,
but I got your number now, doc.

31:56.456 --> 32:00.376
-You're sick.
-No, my friend, you're sick.

32:00.544 --> 32:04.422
Back when I was sojourning
at Casa del Cadmus...

32:04.590 --> 32:06.757
...I had some time to think.

32:06.925 --> 32:11.887
And the one thought that kept
gnawing at my brain was:

32:12.055 --> 32:15.433
"What in the world was Dr. Alan Farragut
doing on this island...

32:15.601 --> 32:18.352
...for all those months
before the contagion hit the boat?"

32:18.520 --> 32:22.898
I mean, if you were really here to stop
the worldwide immortal conspiracy...

32:23.066 --> 32:26.861
...why didn't you kill Michael?
You had plenty of opportunities.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.572
What now? I can't hear you.

32:29.740 --> 32:33.451
-Ilaria.
-Ilaria, right.

32:39.708 --> 32:42.585
You're in Paris picking off immortals
one by one...

32:42.753 --> 32:44.795
...but you realize
that could take forever.

32:45.631 --> 32:48.466
Then you get a piece of intel
about a rogue immortal...

32:48.634 --> 32:50.426
...running experiments on this island.

32:50.594 --> 32:54.055
So you hop a boat
and join the fellowship. Hallelujah!

32:54.222 --> 32:55.681
Cut me down.

32:55.849 --> 32:58.267
You really wanted
to stick it to Ilaria, didn't you?

32:58.435 --> 33:00.436
So you stay here.

33:00.604 --> 33:03.230
But not working against Michael, no.

33:03.899 --> 33:05.650
Working for him.

33:06.109 --> 33:08.277
Developing the perfect
biological weapon.

33:09.529 --> 33:13.282
A fungus that would infect
anybody who ingested it.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.703
You created this.

33:18.372 --> 33:20.289
You did this to me.

33:20.457 --> 33:21.457
No.

33:21.625 --> 33:23.793
Thought you were gonna
watch me die, did you?

33:24.419 --> 33:26.921
Now I'm gonna return the favor.

33:29.174 --> 33:33.094
And then I think I'm gonna
eat your eyes.

33:53.448 --> 33:55.783
You know what I don't understand?

33:56.326 --> 34:01.414
Why we go to such inexhaustible lengths
to hide these.

34:02.457 --> 34:08.087
Michael with his injections,
you with your contact lenses.

34:08.714 --> 34:12.883
I will never hide
my glorious silver eyes.

34:13.385 --> 34:16.429
It's time for you to keep up
your end of the deal.

34:17.347 --> 34:18.597
Where's Mother?

34:18.765 --> 34:22.643
Why you care about a dried-up,
old root is beyond me.

34:23.770 --> 34:27.982
I couldn't see before, but now?

34:29.109 --> 34:33.154
Everything is so clear, so endless.

34:35.574 --> 34:39.243
-Well, that's seven years' bad luck.
-I'm not gonna ask you again.

34:42.539 --> 34:45.541
What do we care?
Seven years is a drop in the bucket.

34:45.709 --> 34:49.295
Just because you're immortal
doesn't mean you can't die.

34:50.714 --> 34:51.756
Fine.

34:54.009 --> 34:56.260
If you want it that badly...

34:57.053 --> 35:01.724
...you'll find it in the hollowed-out belly
of an old tree stump...

35:01.892 --> 35:05.186
... 150 yards north of the main gate.

35:29.211 --> 35:30.211
More duct tape here.

35:30.378 --> 35:32.129
-Tighter up here.
-Coming right up.

35:32.297 --> 35:34.340
Yeah, disable the fan.

35:34.508 --> 35:36.050
Two more over there.

35:37.719 --> 35:38.719
What's wrong, doc?

35:39.513 --> 35:41.013
Can't hold out any longer?

35:44.309 --> 35:46.185
What's this?
You wanna play too, huh?

36:04.996 --> 36:06.664
Gear up, boys. This is going down.

36:06.832 --> 36:09.041
Get your MOPP suits
and gas masks on.

36:09.209 --> 36:11.877
They should protect us.
We have a mission to finish.

37:13.690 --> 37:15.149
You see, Father?

37:15.317 --> 37:18.068
I'm just like you, only better.

37:18.737 --> 37:21.697
You spent 500 years trying
to make an immortal...

37:21.865 --> 37:25.409
...and I, I succeeded in a mere 19.

37:25.577 --> 37:28.787
Your legacy is over!

37:28.955 --> 37:32.124
And mine is just beginning.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.720
What's happening to me?

38:41.653 --> 38:44.780
You cheated me!

39:17.897 --> 39:19.023
My God.

39:20.942 --> 39:22.985
You did it, Peter.

39:24.112 --> 39:26.238
You saved the Abbey.

39:28.283 --> 39:30.951
Now you just have to finish the job.

40:25.131 --> 40:26.340
You did this yourself?

40:26.508 --> 40:28.509
Yeah. You showed me how.

40:28.676 --> 40:30.844
You said it would save Dr. Kyle.

40:31.346 --> 40:33.097
It did.

40:33.264 --> 40:35.390
And it saved me.

40:36.309 --> 40:37.976
I'm on a good path?

40:38.561 --> 40:41.021
You're on a good path.

40:43.566 --> 40:45.067
You are on a good path.

40:53.910 --> 40:56.370
Julia. Are you okay?

40:59.666 --> 41:01.375
You found Mother.

41:02.377 --> 41:04.044
So did the gas.

41:06.464 --> 41:07.506
It's dead.

41:10.176 --> 41:12.678
Now the rest of the world's
gonna be dead too.
