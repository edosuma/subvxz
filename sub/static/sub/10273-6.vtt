WEBVTT

00:02.741 --> 00:04.448
<i>Previously on The Americans...</i>

00:04.577 --> 00:07.212
<i>When we got here,</i>
<i>I was 22 years old,</i>

00:07.279 --> 00:09.780
living in a strange house
in a strange country,

00:09.848 --> 00:11.116
with a strange man.

00:11.183 --> 00:13.084
It never really happened
for us,

00:13.152 --> 00:15.487
but I feel like
it's happening now.

00:15.554 --> 00:17.788
You're violating
a shitload of Soviet laws,

00:17.856 --> 00:20.258
and you're looking at 10 years
in a Siberian labor camp.

00:20.326 --> 00:21.593
You're gonna have to
start working for me.

00:24.863 --> 00:26.297
How did you
get him to talk?

00:26.365 --> 00:28.299
I sucked his cock,
just like you told me to.

00:28.367 --> 00:30.268
I never said that.
I-I never said that.

00:30.302 --> 00:31.642
Nina, Jesus...

00:31.777 --> 00:33.938
Mr. Martin from the DOJ is
on the line for you, Agent Gaad.

00:34.006 --> 00:35.906
Big day at
FBI Counterintelligence?

00:35.974 --> 00:37.308
They were
in the secure vault all day.

00:37.376 --> 00:39.844
Did you get a look inside
this time?

00:39.911 --> 00:41.246
They don't let me in there.

00:43.015 --> 00:44.782
As soon as we got
those encryption codes from you,

00:44.850 --> 00:46.184
the FBI changed them.

00:46.252 --> 00:48.819
- Immediately?
- Within the day.

00:48.887 --> 00:51.456
Right when they were leaving
for the meet, like they knew.

00:51.524 --> 00:54.459
You understand
what that means?

00:54.527 --> 00:56.294
Somebody's talking.

00:56.362 --> 01:00.165
Somebody's talking.
We have a mole.

01:01.900 --> 01:04.101
<i>- Leonard winds up to pitch.</i>
<i>- How does this happen?</i>

01:05.570 --> 01:07.705
<i>- High and outside.</i>
- It's one of the things that happens

01:07.773 --> 01:09.340
when people
are involved.

01:09.941 --> 01:11.776
And they're sure it's someone
in the Rezidentura?

01:11.843 --> 01:13.144
It couldn't be a leak
in Moscow?

01:13.211 --> 01:15.479
She seemed to know.

01:15.547 --> 01:18.115
- Mom, you ready?
- I'll be right there.

01:18.183 --> 01:19.483
<i>Next pitch on the way.</i>

01:19.551 --> 01:21.518
I assume the FBI
are running the mole,

01:21.586 --> 01:24.121
- so I need to press Martha hard.
<i>- A high fly ball to center.</i>

01:24.189 --> 01:26.323
Henry's waiting in the car.

01:26.391 --> 01:28.159
- Can we go, please?
- Yes.

01:28.226 --> 01:30.995
<i>He got under that one.</i>
<i>Still up there.</i>

01:31.063 --> 01:33.831
<i>Settles under it</i>
<i>and makes the catch.</i>

01:33.899 --> 01:37.068
<i>And that is one down here</i>
<i>in the third.</i>

01:39.204 --> 01:41.972
<i>The O's kicked off</i>
<i>the season Friday night</i>

01:42.040 --> 01:43.808
<i>with a 5-3 win</i>
<i>against Kansas City.</i>

01:43.875 --> 01:47.411
I just got out of a...
an important meeting.

01:47.478 --> 01:49.080
Really? What about?

01:49.147 --> 01:51.816
I--
I can't really say.

01:51.883 --> 01:53.017
Top secret?

01:53.085 --> 01:55.152
Actually, I can't say

01:55.220 --> 01:57.221
because I didn't hear
a word that was said.

01:57.288 --> 01:59.090
Why is that?

01:59.124 --> 02:01.658
I was thinking about you,
to tell the truth.

02:01.727 --> 02:04.261
Oh?

02:04.329 --> 02:06.697
Look, even if we can't
have anything more

02:06.765 --> 02:08.532
than a professional
relationship,

02:08.600 --> 02:11.401
I would still like to
see you sometime socially.

02:11.469 --> 02:14.004
I would like that.

02:14.072 --> 02:17.407
Well, I could be
at your apartment in 20 minutes,

02:17.475 --> 02:19.043
if you want a cup of coffee
or something.

02:19.111 --> 02:21.678
I would like that,
but I have to work.

02:23.014 --> 02:25.515
- It's Sunday.
- It's my new boss.

02:25.583 --> 02:29.086
He's showing me how important he
is by wrecking my filing system.

02:29.154 --> 02:30.420
And my weekend.

02:30.488 --> 02:32.522
Well, you could be
a half-hour late.

02:35.160 --> 02:36.293
I'll put a pot on.

02:36.361 --> 02:39.596
- See you soon.
- Great.

02:43.769 --> 02:45.535
Come on!
Get in there!

what am I doing here?

Who-- who are you?

03:36.196 --> 03:38.297
Who are you?!

03:53.446 --> 03:56.582
What...

03:56.649 --> 03:59.018
what do you want?

03:59.086 --> 04:01.821
You, Mr. Jennings.

04:01.888 --> 04:03.823
We want you.

04:03.890 --> 04:06.658
- My name's not Jennings.
- Philip Jennings, 39.

04:06.727 --> 04:07.893
Wife-- Elizabeth.

04:07.961 --> 04:09.862
Children--
Paige and Henry.

04:12.398 --> 04:15.101
Seems to be out late at night
quite a bit.

04:15.168 --> 04:17.903
Lives across the street
from an FBI agent.

04:17.971 --> 04:22.341
Also, the details
of his life before 1963

04:22.408 --> 04:26.511
seem to be a bit... hazy.

04:56.709 --> 05:02.481
We know who you are
and what you are, Mr. Jennings.

05:02.548 --> 05:04.549
You Commie prick.

06:45.252 --> 06:46.352
You wanted to see me, sir?

06:46.419 --> 06:49.255
I wanted your take
on something.

06:51.591 --> 06:53.392
Sorry to call you in
on a Sunday.

06:53.459 --> 06:54.860
Oh, that's okay.

06:54.895 --> 06:56.661
I was-- I was headed
into town, anyway.

06:57.998 --> 06:59.831
All those years undercover, Beeman--

06:59.900 --> 07:01.666
I had you pegged
for a better liar than that.

07:01.734 --> 07:04.503
How did you keep those white
supremacists from making you?

07:04.570 --> 07:06.105
Well, I didn't work
for them, sir.

07:06.172 --> 07:07.606
Entirely different
dynamic.

07:07.673 --> 07:11.743
Take a look at this.
Tell me what you think.

07:11.811 --> 07:15.747
What have we got?

07:15.815 --> 07:19.751
Adam Dorwin.
Single gunshot wound.

07:19.819 --> 07:24.957
Nothing stolen,
no criminal history.

07:25.025 --> 07:26.691
He was shot two miles

07:26.759 --> 07:30.095
from where we were
surveilling the Rezident.

07:30.163 --> 07:33.265
Looks like...
right around the same time.

07:37.503 --> 07:39.604
Should I get my
"Carmac the Magnificent" turban?

07:39.672 --> 07:42.041
Are you gonna tell me
the rest?

07:42.108 --> 07:44.810
The government has
a secret defense program--

07:44.877 --> 07:46.245
something
about missiles.

07:46.313 --> 07:48.247
I-- I don't have
more detail than that.

07:48.315 --> 07:52.484
But Dorwin was project manager
for a company called Viseotech.

07:52.552 --> 07:54.920
They were working
on the missile technology?

07:54.988 --> 07:58.557
About a month ago,
some blueprints disappeared.

07:58.624 --> 08:02.294
That's all they told me--
"Top-secret blueprints,

08:02.362 --> 08:04.997
Defense Department,
very unhappy."

08:05.065 --> 08:07.833
A Viseotech employee
just happens to get shot

08:07.900 --> 08:10.235
at the exact same time
that we're...

08:10.303 --> 08:13.439
tracking
the KGB Rezident.

08:13.506 --> 08:15.441
That's a hell
of a coincidence.

08:16.876 --> 08:18.477
My mother always said

08:18.544 --> 08:21.847
coincidence was God's way
of winking at you.

08:21.914 --> 08:26.051
That doesn't exactly feel like
a friendly wink, does it?

10:35.781 --> 10:38.117
Let's put these bags
in the truck.

10:39.619 --> 10:43.755
What time is mom
supposed to get here?

10:43.823 --> 10:45.824
About an hour ago.

10:45.891 --> 10:49.661
- You have any change?
- For what?

10:49.729 --> 10:51.663
To call home, doofus.

10:51.731 --> 10:54.266
Yeah,
but you owe me.

11:13.353 --> 11:15.287
Come on.

11:15.355 --> 11:16.921
Where are we going?

11:16.989 --> 11:19.858
Do you want to get home or not?

11:19.925 --> 11:22.694
Slow down!

11:22.762 --> 11:24.696
Mom's not gonna see us
from here.

11:24.764 --> 11:27.932
Mom's not here.

11:29.902 --> 11:33.038
We're not
supposed to hitch, Paige.

11:33.105 --> 11:36.275
We're not supposed to be left
at the mall.

11:36.342 --> 11:38.510
Are you scared?

11:38.578 --> 11:39.978
No. This is stupid.

11:40.012 --> 11:41.446
We should just
go back and wait.

11:41.514 --> 11:43.649
You can wait.
I'm going home.

12:07.573 --> 12:09.508
- Hey.
- I'm done.

12:09.575 --> 12:11.109
You have to
exfiltrate me.

12:11.176 --> 12:13.177
The Rezidentura
is on the hunt for a mole.

12:13.245 --> 12:14.846
I've been of help to you.
I have fulfilled my obligation.

12:14.914 --> 12:17.115
It's your turn now.

12:17.182 --> 12:18.283
Look, you're gonna have
your chance to leave.

12:18.350 --> 12:19.684
- I promise.
- You don't understand.

12:19.752 --> 12:22.220
- I have to leave now.
- You need to stay calm.

12:22.288 --> 12:23.855
"Calm"?

12:23.923 --> 12:25.690
They're going to
put a bullet in my head.

12:25.758 --> 12:28.259
I will not
let that happen.

12:28.294 --> 12:30.862
You know what they do to people
suspected of treason?

12:30.930 --> 12:32.898
They put them on a plane
back to Russia,

12:32.965 --> 12:34.699
no discussions,
no questions.

12:34.767 --> 12:36.067
They get them a trial and a lawyer,
and they find them guilty.

12:36.135 --> 12:39.538
And I <i>am</i> guilty.

12:39.605 --> 12:41.372
You have to
get me out now.

12:41.441 --> 12:45.310
You have to trust me,
Nina... okay?

12:45.377 --> 12:48.713
Trust me.

13:07.232 --> 13:11.603
I want a list of every
KGB agent you know of--

13:11.671 --> 13:15.474
the ones you're running,
other Directorate "S" illegals.

13:18.978 --> 13:21.780
Too much to ask?

13:21.814 --> 13:26.618
How about we start
with all dead-drop sites.

13:26.652 --> 13:30.922
KGB communication
protocols.

13:33.559 --> 13:37.161
We both know where
this is gonna go, Mr. Jennings.

13:43.068 --> 13:47.005
It's up to you
how long we do this.

13:47.072 --> 13:49.808
There will be no spy trades
under this president.

13:51.511 --> 13:54.412
I'm not a spy.

13:58.751 --> 14:01.119
<i>Big day</i>
<i>at FBI Counterintelligence?</i>

14:01.186 --> 14:04.055
<i>Yes, it was.</i>

14:04.123 --> 14:05.557
<i>Obviously,</i>
<i>we know most of it,</i>

14:05.625 --> 14:07.125
<i>but I just want to hear</i>
<i>the details from you</i>

14:07.192 --> 14:08.660
<i>because a crisis</i>
<i>can provide an opportunity</i>

14:08.728 --> 14:10.862
<i>to uncover the leaks</i>

14:10.930 --> 14:12.363
<i>that we have been looking for</i>
<i>in your office.</i>

14:12.431 --> 14:15.534
<i>So just tell me</i>
<i>what you saw.</i>

14:15.568 --> 14:16.968
<i>Well...</i>

14:17.036 --> 14:20.071
<i>I-I know</i>
<i>that a man was kidnapped.</i>

14:21.774 --> 14:27.178
Lots of passports,
multiple identities.

14:27.246 --> 14:31.215
There's been some interesting
debate about your children.

14:35.054 --> 14:37.388
They were born here,
so technically,

14:37.456 --> 14:40.692
they're American citizens.

14:40.760 --> 14:44.563
Can that be revoked?

14:44.630 --> 14:47.732
Can they be
sent back to Russia?

14:50.135 --> 14:53.438
Oh, they don't speak Russian,
do they?

14:55.074 --> 14:58.276
Maybe they become wards
of the United States government.

15:04.450 --> 15:07.318
Go to hell.

15:09.956 --> 15:11.890
Bring her in! Let's go!

15:11.958 --> 15:13.858
Go.

15:43.119 --> 15:44.754
Hey, where you headed?

15:44.821 --> 15:46.656
Falls Church Commons.

15:46.723 --> 15:47.890
Well, hop in.

15:53.463 --> 15:55.230
Well, listen, I-I don't have
a whole lot of time, folks.

15:55.298 --> 15:57.867
I got to be to work in..
well, less than an hour.

15:57.935 --> 16:01.070
You know,
it's not that far.

16:01.137 --> 16:02.705
We'll just walk.
Thanks anyway.

16:02.773 --> 16:04.106
I mean, it's 10 miles.

16:04.174 --> 16:07.577
It's right on my way,
but, okay, sure.

16:10.246 --> 16:12.381
Wait! Hey, wait!

16:12.449 --> 16:15.184
It's 10 miles.

16:15.251 --> 16:17.553
Sorry.
My brother's a little...

16:17.621 --> 16:19.822
- Hey, not a problem.
- Thanks.

16:25.629 --> 16:27.029
Get in.

16:35.205 --> 16:36.806
I'm Nick.

16:36.873 --> 16:38.474
Paige.
Thanks for stopping.

16:38.541 --> 16:40.242
We were
stranded at the mall.

16:40.310 --> 16:43.613
- Y'all hitchhike before?
- Yeah. Sure.

16:43.680 --> 16:46.548
How old are you?

16:46.617 --> 16:48.618
13.

16:48.685 --> 16:50.019
Hey, chief.

16:52.122 --> 16:54.790
That's Henry.
Sorry he's so rude.

16:54.858 --> 16:58.460
He's chill.

17:46.376 --> 17:50.179
It turns out our dead guy
had access-- SCI clearance.

17:50.213 --> 17:53.783
And he was familiar with
the genesis of the technology.

17:53.850 --> 17:55.985
You think he was leaking
information to the Russians?

17:56.053 --> 17:59.955
Like I said, I believe in God
but not coincidence.

18:00.023 --> 18:03.192
- Did <i>we</i> take him out?
- Not as far as I know.

18:03.259 --> 18:06.195
My CIA sources say
he wasn't even on their radar

18:06.262 --> 18:08.263
till his body
turned up.

18:10.400 --> 18:13.002
What did your friend
say about him?

18:13.070 --> 18:16.205
My friend
has a big problem.

18:16.272 --> 18:18.640
Rezidentura knows
there's a leak.

18:18.709 --> 18:21.911
These are
dangerous operations.

18:23.580 --> 18:25.614
You know those Africans
the criminal-investigation guys

18:25.648 --> 18:28.017
busted a few months ago with
the diamonds in their asses?

18:28.085 --> 18:29.585
Ohh.

18:29.652 --> 18:32.188
I almost felt sorry for
the CID guys on that one.

18:32.255 --> 18:35.691
Yeah, I'd like to request
some of the jewels.

18:35.759 --> 18:37.359
I don't think your wife's
gonna appreciate it

18:37.427 --> 18:38.994
if she ever finds out
where they came from.

18:41.431 --> 18:45.201
So, chief,
you play any sports?

18:45.268 --> 18:48.604
I played football
in high school, free safety.

18:48.671 --> 18:50.439
Loved to hit.

18:50.506 --> 18:53.275
Free safeties are usually
the hardest hitter on "D."

18:53.343 --> 18:55.745
Henry.

18:55.812 --> 18:57.346
Oh, that's okay.

18:57.413 --> 18:59.514
Little man doesn't want to talk,
he doesn't have to.

19:01.118 --> 19:03.085
Hey, cool with you guys
if I make a quick stop?

19:03.153 --> 19:04.686
I thought you had
somewhere to be.

19:04.755 --> 19:06.622
Ho-ho,
little man <i>can</i> talk.

19:11.027 --> 19:13.963
- Bread?
- For the ducks.

19:14.030 --> 19:16.365
I always feed them
on my way to work.

19:24.975 --> 19:27.143
And?

19:41.892 --> 19:43.225
Get up.

19:50.533 --> 19:52.467
Come on.

19:52.535 --> 19:54.937
We have to get home
kind of soon.

19:55.005 --> 19:56.939
It'll only
take a minute.

19:57.007 --> 20:00.009
You don't want the ducks
to starve, do you?

20:07.417 --> 20:08.984
Come on, chief.

20:09.052 --> 20:12.922
I'll introduce you
to Donald.

20:19.495 --> 20:23.432
That's nice.

20:35.011 --> 20:38.547
Try it.

20:38.614 --> 20:40.615
It's Dutch.

20:48.925 --> 20:52.161
- You don't like it?
- No, it's-- it's good.

20:54.865 --> 20:59.801
Hey. Make some
new friends, chief.

21:05.308 --> 21:07.476
You know...

21:07.543 --> 21:10.545
you're definitely gonna be
a knockout in a couple of years.

21:10.613 --> 21:13.582
I'm not hitting on you
or anything,

21:13.649 --> 21:15.484
but... you can expect
to break some hearts.

21:15.551 --> 21:17.119
Thanks.

21:19.822 --> 21:22.758
You guys know how dangerous
it is to hitchhike?

21:22.825 --> 21:25.160
I mean...

21:25.228 --> 21:29.498
you're lucky you ran into me
and not some lunatic.

21:35.338 --> 21:36.872
Um...

21:36.940 --> 21:39.441
You know, I-- I think we can
walk the rest of the way.

21:39.509 --> 21:41.277
- Right, Henry?
- Yeah.

21:41.344 --> 21:44.179
Thanks for taking us
this far. Come on.

21:46.082 --> 21:48.817
Hey!

21:50.820 --> 21:54.656
Somebody paid
for that beer-- me.

21:58.995 --> 22:02.932
Not a lot of ducks,
huh, chief?

22:02.999 --> 22:05.200
Must be a duck holiday.

22:08.104 --> 22:09.638
See, the thing is...

22:09.705 --> 22:12.908
I've done a lot
of stupid stuff in my life.

22:14.444 --> 22:17.246
Things someone should have
talked me out of...

22:17.314 --> 22:20.882
before I messed up.

22:20.951 --> 22:23.919
Grab me another beer,
will you, chief?

22:33.463 --> 22:35.597
See, that's the thing.

22:35.665 --> 22:38.334
We all need somebody to keep us
on the straight and narrow,

22:38.401 --> 22:41.770
someone who will call us
on our shit...

22:41.838 --> 22:44.139
who ain't afraid
to put the fear of God in us.

22:44.207 --> 22:46.575
You believe in God,
chief?

22:46.642 --> 22:48.743
- Yeah.
- Good.

22:48.811 --> 22:52.747
Because the society is lost
if people lose faith.

22:52.815 --> 22:54.916
I mean, seriously...

22:54.985 --> 22:58.954
Without a higher power,
we're no better than wild dogs.

22:59.022 --> 23:01.023
Aah!

23:01.091 --> 23:03.359
Run, Paige! Run!

23:03.426 --> 23:05.927
Aah!

23:29.019 --> 23:30.685
This is a camera.

23:30.720 --> 23:33.855
I need you to photograph
documents at the Rezidentura.

23:33.923 --> 23:35.224
Doesn't matter which ones

23:35.291 --> 23:37.292
as long as
they're highly classified.

23:39.262 --> 23:40.629
You said
I could trust you.

23:40.696 --> 23:42.564
You said that
you have it figured out--

23:42.632 --> 23:43.999
that you would
have a plan.

23:44.067 --> 23:45.234
This is the plan.

23:45.301 --> 23:49.471
It's suicide.
If somebody catches me...

23:51.607 --> 23:54.043
Listen to me, Nina.

23:56.146 --> 23:59.714
I've been where you are.
I've lived it.

23:59.782 --> 24:06.355
I know what it is to feel fear
in every fiber of your being

24:06.423 --> 24:07.756
and not be
able to show it.

24:07.823 --> 24:10.192
I've been there.

24:10.260 --> 24:13.828
Now, I can get you out.

24:13.896 --> 24:17.999
But... you have to
stay with me.

24:18.068 --> 24:20.169
Okay?

24:20.236 --> 24:24.106
What if I'm caught?

24:24.174 --> 24:26.875
You won't be.

24:26.943 --> 24:29.844
You can do this, Nina.

24:29.912 --> 24:32.747
We can do this.

24:35.318 --> 24:39.488
Even if
I can take the pictures...

24:39.522 --> 24:41.290
there's no way
I can sneak them out.

24:41.357 --> 24:43.592
The security
is very tight.

24:43.659 --> 24:47.296
You won't have to.

24:57.707 --> 24:59.541
There are no
happy endings here.

25:01.844 --> 25:04.613
You can help her, you know?
Talk now.

25:04.680 --> 25:06.681
Save her a lot of pain.

25:16.959 --> 25:18.727
Up to you.

25:18.794 --> 25:20.895
What do you think
you're gonna get from us?

25:22.999 --> 25:26.368
Why don't you tell me?

25:28.304 --> 25:29.904
Fine, I will tell you.

25:34.644 --> 25:35.777
Nothing.

25:35.845 --> 25:39.080
You get nothing
from us.

25:40.650 --> 25:43.285
She's trained for this.
So am I.

25:43.353 --> 25:45.454
We'll die
before we'll talk.

25:45.522 --> 25:46.988
We know how to do that.

25:52.328 --> 25:54.163
That's enough.

25:57.867 --> 26:00.802
I'm sorry.

26:00.870 --> 26:04.139
We had to know
if you were the mole,

26:04.207 --> 26:06.007
if we could... trust you.

26:06.075 --> 26:08.210
Untie him.

26:12.014 --> 26:14.783
If you could trust us?

26:14.850 --> 26:16.785
Yes.

26:16.852 --> 26:19.655
Very few of us knew about
the FBI's encryption codes.

26:19.722 --> 26:21.156
You were the first two.

26:21.191 --> 26:24.326
And within a day,
the FBI knew.

26:24.394 --> 26:26.528
What were we
supposed to think?

26:26.596 --> 26:29.864
We should be the last people
you suspect.

26:29.932 --> 26:32.301
This wasn't done lightly.

26:32.368 --> 26:34.536
You understand
what's at stake.

26:34.604 --> 26:36.371
If there was
the slightest possibility

26:36.439 --> 26:38.006
that you
were betraying us,

26:38.074 --> 26:41.610
that would be a blow
we would be unable to sustain.

26:41.678 --> 26:43.912
We <i>had</i> to know.

26:43.979 --> 26:46.147
Did you have permission
for this?

26:46.249 --> 26:48.684
Did Zhukov approve this?

26:48.751 --> 26:53.222
This decision was made
far above Zhukov's head.

27:03.933 --> 27:05.734
That's enough.

27:05.801 --> 27:07.902
That's enough!

27:09.905 --> 27:13.508
I'm gonna kill you,
you stupid bitch!

27:21.317 --> 27:23.184
Tell whoever approved this

27:23.253 --> 27:26.455
that your face is a present
from me to them!

27:26.522 --> 27:29.023
Show them your face!
Show it to them!

27:29.091 --> 27:31.025
Where's my car?

27:31.093 --> 27:33.228
Where's my car?!

27:36.031 --> 27:39.801
Sit down.

27:39.869 --> 27:41.236
Go.

27:54.546 --> 27:56.113
Okay.

27:59.184 --> 28:01.519
Grannie knew everything--

28:01.587 --> 28:03.354
everything we knew
about those encryption keys.

28:03.421 --> 28:06.090
What were they gonna do,
string her up, too?

28:06.157 --> 28:08.158
I was this close
to killing her.

28:08.226 --> 28:09.827
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, you?

28:09.895 --> 28:11.362
Yeah.

28:11.429 --> 28:15.366
How could they do that to us?
What did they do to you?

28:15.433 --> 28:17.201
Psychological pressure--
pictures of the kids.

28:17.268 --> 28:18.636
They didn't
question you?

28:18.704 --> 28:19.904
No.

28:22.708 --> 28:24.041
They stopped?

28:24.109 --> 28:25.943
Yeah.

28:31.783 --> 28:33.350
You told them.

28:33.418 --> 28:36.387
What? What are you
talking about?

28:36.454 --> 28:38.288
You told them
I considered defecting.

28:38.356 --> 28:39.857
That's why
this is happening.

28:39.925 --> 28:43.227
I didn't.

28:43.294 --> 28:45.362
What did you tell them?

28:45.430 --> 28:49.033
Nothing.

28:49.100 --> 28:52.670
You're lying.
I can see it.

28:52.738 --> 28:54.138
What did you tell them?

28:54.205 --> 28:56.974
Philip.

28:57.042 --> 28:59.577
Philip... we are supposed to
tell them things.

28:59.645 --> 29:01.812
That is part of this job.
I...

29:01.880 --> 29:05.783
if I said <i>anything</i>
<i>that made them think--</i>

29:05.817 --> 29:08.385
if I said
anything that would...

29:08.453 --> 29:10.655
it would have been
so long ago.

29:10.722 --> 29:14.926
What did you tell them?

29:14.993 --> 29:20.565
I told them that
you liked it here too much.

29:28.740 --> 29:30.908
- Philip. Philip.
- Don't touch me.

29:30.976 --> 29:33.343
Don't act like
I made something up!

29:33.411 --> 29:35.546
They asked me,
and I answered!

29:35.614 --> 29:37.748
You loved it here! You started
loving it more and more!

29:37.816 --> 29:39.116
Now look
what finally happened!

29:39.184 --> 29:41.351
I fit in!!

29:41.419 --> 29:43.955
I fit in,
like I was supposed to!

29:44.022 --> 29:47.257
And, yes, I liked it.
So what?

29:47.325 --> 29:51.929
I was supposed to be
able to trust you, and I did.

29:51.964 --> 29:54.732
And I shouldn't have.
I never should have.

29:54.800 --> 29:58.535
That's not true.

30:23.561 --> 30:24.729
You okay?

30:26.331 --> 30:29.133
What if he wasn't gonna do
anything bad to us?

30:29.200 --> 30:32.402
He was a creep, Henry.

30:34.973 --> 30:38.909
What you did today...
took courage.

30:38.977 --> 30:41.311
But I was scared.

30:41.379 --> 30:42.713
I know.

30:46.084 --> 30:47.852
What happened today...

30:47.919 --> 30:51.321
has to be our secret,
okay?

30:51.389 --> 30:54.659
O-okay.

31:00.098 --> 31:02.733
What? What's wrong?

31:04.936 --> 31:09.506
I had an accident.

31:09.574 --> 31:12.943
All right.

31:13.011 --> 31:14.779
Come on.
Let's go downstairs.

31:14.846 --> 31:16.180
I'll wash them
for you.

31:16.247 --> 31:17.682
Okay.

32:28.453 --> 32:31.455
Nina?

32:33.234 --> 32:34.487
_

32:34.747 --> 32:37.923
_

32:39.765 --> 32:43.551
_

32:43.684 --> 32:45.053
_

32:46.709 --> 32:48.549
_

32:49.839 --> 32:51.332
_

34:19.998 --> 34:21.398
Thank you.

34:28.340 --> 34:29.940
$3.49.

34:29.975 --> 34:31.909
There's a sale
on the Earl Grey.

34:31.976 --> 34:34.978
This is fine.

34:35.045 --> 34:36.981
Now, that's good stuff.

34:37.047 --> 34:39.850
You want to use the water
before it boils.

34:39.918 --> 34:42.052
I know how to brew tea.
Thank you.

34:45.924 --> 34:47.123
Oh.

34:47.192 --> 34:49.360
Sorry about that.

34:57.602 --> 34:59.603
Enjoy.

35:14.052 --> 35:15.619
It's done.

35:26.131 --> 35:27.831
Switchboard.

35:27.899 --> 35:30.834
Yeah, route me through the phone
booth on Pennsylvania and 11th.

35:33.538 --> 35:37.007
Cultural desk.
How may I help you?

35:37.108 --> 35:39.476
Yes, could I speak
to Vasili Nikolaevich?

35:39.544 --> 35:42.879
Uh, one moment.

35:42.948 --> 35:45.849
Uh, he's unavailable.
May I take a message?

35:45.917 --> 35:49.686
Yes, tell him there's a tea shop
in Piccadilly Circus

35:49.754 --> 35:52.656
that I know he'll enjoy
when he's not under the gun.

35:52.723 --> 35:55.426
May I tell him
who's calling?

35:55.493 --> 35:57.661
Tell him it's Theo.

35:57.728 --> 35:59.496
"Theo" who?

35:59.564 --> 36:03.067
He'll know.

36:37.502 --> 36:38.668
Guys?

36:40.372 --> 36:43.540
Oh, my God.

36:43.608 --> 36:45.542
- What happened? - I was changing
the station while we were driving,

36:45.610 --> 36:46.910
which is a stupid thing
to do and--

36:46.978 --> 36:49.913
We hit some ice,
and it's okay.

36:49.981 --> 36:51.815
And we're okay.

36:51.883 --> 36:53.250
And everything
is okay.

36:53.318 --> 36:55.952
Does it hurt?

36:56.021 --> 36:58.389
Uh... a little, yes.

36:58.456 --> 37:01.392
I'm-- I'm so sorry I wasn't
there to pick you guys up.

37:01.459 --> 37:03.894
- It's okay.
- How did you get home?

37:03.961 --> 37:05.496
Shelly's mom
drove us home.

37:05.530 --> 37:07.464
Oh. Okay.

37:07.532 --> 37:10.867
Good. Good.

37:12.703 --> 37:16.073
Look, it has been a very,
very long day,

37:16.141 --> 37:18.008
so what do you say
we all get ready for bed?

37:18.043 --> 37:19.809
Okay.
I'll beat you upstairs!

37:19.877 --> 37:23.147
No racing.

37:29.387 --> 37:31.755
I'm, uh, gonna go
and see Martha.

37:31.822 --> 37:33.590
I never made it there
this morning.

37:33.658 --> 37:34.758
Okay.

37:34.825 --> 37:36.360
I want to take her
some jewelry.

37:36.428 --> 37:38.362
Make up
for missing the date.

37:38.430 --> 37:40.064
Do you have anything?

37:44.835 --> 37:46.236
Do you have anything?

38:06.791 --> 38:11.061
I'm sure she'll love it.

38:26.457 --> 38:28.058
Cultural desk.
How may I help you?

38:28.125 --> 38:29.459
Is Vasili there?

38:30.961 --> 38:34.630
- Not yet.
- Tell Vasili it's urgent.

38:34.698 --> 38:36.566
Sir, unless you tell me what
this is about, I can't help.

38:59.957 --> 39:02.258
When a lady calls,
I oblige.

39:02.326 --> 39:05.895
That's what
the lady counts on.

39:08.632 --> 39:10.066
What happened?

39:10.134 --> 39:12.835
Can I have one of those?

39:12.903 --> 39:15.738
I thought you stopped.

39:15.806 --> 39:19.175
Old habits are
hard to break.

39:27.251 --> 39:30.320
So, where do you
want my eyes?

39:30.387 --> 39:33.656
My children.
And Philip.

39:33.724 --> 39:36.526
I'd rather keep
them on you.

39:36.594 --> 39:40.029
On me, too, then.

39:51.342 --> 39:53.943
What's going on,
Elizabeth?

39:58.215 --> 40:00.783
There's a mole.

40:00.851 --> 40:03.620
I need to know
if I'm being watched.

40:03.687 --> 40:05.221
No one knows
you exist.

40:05.289 --> 40:08.057
Someone knows.

40:20.871 --> 40:24.974
I'll be your eyes.

40:51.002 --> 40:52.855
_

40:53.439 --> 40:54.791
_

40:55.343 --> 40:58.884
_

41:03.755 --> 41:05.585
_

41:07.499 --> 41:09.137
_

41:10.071 --> 41:11.668
_

41:12.459 --> 41:14.057
_

41:14.311 --> 41:15.929
_

41:16.972 --> 41:18.746
_

41:19.006 --> 41:20.685
_

41:20.956 --> 41:22.947
_

41:23.247 --> 41:25.335
_

41:25.487 --> 41:26.609
_

41:26.750 --> 41:28.749
_

41:29.004 --> 41:31.278
_

41:31.813 --> 41:34.995
_

41:35.523 --> 41:36.939
_

41:37.089 --> 41:38.087
_

41:39.640 --> 41:41.272
_

41:43.298 --> 41:45.079
_

41:45.381 --> 41:46.579
_

41:47.261 --> 41:48.744
_

41:49.453 --> 41:52.765
_

41:53.830 --> 41:56.332
Gregory.

42:04.153 --> 42:06.550
_

42:15.018 --> 42:16.488
_

42:16.885 --> 42:18.197
_

42:22.791 --> 42:25.453
_

42:37.661 --> 42:41.462
_

42:55.119 --> 42:57.928
_

43:01.061 --> 43:04.617
_

43:04.743 --> 43:07.014
_

43:07.442 --> 43:10.286
_

43:10.954 --> 43:12.262
_

43:25.148 --> 43:28.867
_

43:34.582 --> 43:36.618
_

43:36.892 --> 43:41.356
_

44:14.872 --> 44:17.039
I got it.

44:17.107 --> 44:19.442
- Beeman.
- It's Gaad.

44:19.510 --> 44:22.445
I just got word--
the Rezident jumped ship

44:22.513 --> 44:24.647
without giving any notice
to the State Department.

44:24.715 --> 44:26.582
You're sure it's him?

44:26.650 --> 44:30.653
I'm staring at a photo of him
getting on a plane as we speak.

44:30.721 --> 44:32.288
He's on his way
back to Russia right now.

44:32.355 --> 44:33.823
Just him?

44:33.891 --> 44:35.425
Just him.

44:37.895 --> 44:39.929
I appreciate the call.

44:39.996 --> 44:42.231
I thought you might.

44:46.703 --> 44:49.505
Is everything okay?

44:49.573 --> 44:53.976
Yeah. Yeah,
everything's good.

44:57.881 --> 45:00.450
Listen.

45:00.517 --> 45:03.152
I get that you can't...
tell me things--

45:03.219 --> 45:04.787
the secrets and stuff,
but...

45:06.256 --> 45:07.523
I mean,
there has to be something

45:07.591 --> 45:08.691
that you can share
with me from work.

45:08.759 --> 45:10.960
I-I mean--
I don't know.

45:11.027 --> 45:13.262
Your boss
gets on your nerves,

45:13.330 --> 45:17.333
or... um... you partner thinks
he's funny, and he's not funny.

45:17.400 --> 45:19.335
I don't know.
Something?

45:19.369 --> 45:22.004
- You're right.
- Anything?

45:25.008 --> 45:28.945
I don't know.

45:29.012 --> 45:31.413
You know, sometimes...

45:34.284 --> 45:38.454
sometimes what I do...
gets scary.

45:38.522 --> 45:41.557
Not for me, you know?

45:41.625 --> 45:45.394
I don't have to worry
about that anymore, but...

45:45.462 --> 45:49.832
but I have to worry
about people.

45:49.900 --> 45:55.471
And today,
it got pretty scary.

45:55.539 --> 45:56.939
But it worked out.

46:00.811 --> 46:04.747
It was a tough day.
But it was a good day.

46:04.815 --> 46:08.183
That's good.

46:08.251 --> 46:09.986
I'm glad.

46:10.053 --> 46:13.422
Me, too.

46:35.646 --> 46:37.212
A car accident?

46:37.280 --> 46:38.614
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

46:38.682 --> 46:40.449
I jumped a light.

46:40.517 --> 46:42.084
I thought
you stood me up.

46:42.152 --> 46:44.854
Are you kidding me?

46:44.922 --> 46:47.423
I think I was just
excited to see you.

46:52.429 --> 46:54.764
- Ooh. Wh-- are you okay?
- Yeah.

46:54.831 --> 46:56.766
Did you see a doctor?

46:56.833 --> 47:00.069
Yeah-- well, a paramedic.
He said I was fine.

47:00.136 --> 47:04.707
Clark, um...

47:04.775 --> 47:06.943
I know that
we're not supposed to,

47:06.977 --> 47:09.545
but maybe
they could assign

47:09.613 --> 47:12.281
someone different from
your office to work with me.

47:14.985 --> 47:16.552
I can't.

47:16.620 --> 47:19.221
I just can't.

47:19.289 --> 47:22.424
And I'm--
I'm sorry, but...

47:22.492 --> 47:25.260
there's something
I would like you to have

47:25.328 --> 47:28.530
so you understand
how I feel.

47:53.857 --> 47:55.190
How did it go?

47:55.258 --> 47:58.027
She got over it.

47:58.095 --> 48:00.663
Philip.

48:00.731 --> 48:02.031
What do you want
from me?

48:02.099 --> 48:05.501
It doesn't matter.
You already did it.

48:05.535 --> 48:08.904
There's no undoing it.

48:14.778 --> 48:20.516
You're not the only one
who got hurt today, okay?

48:20.583 --> 48:21.884
I was ripped
from my house.

48:21.952 --> 48:23.786
I was attacked by the people
I believed in,

48:23.854 --> 48:26.455
the people I trusted most
my whole life.

48:28.759 --> 48:31.393
Yeah, I think
that says it all.
