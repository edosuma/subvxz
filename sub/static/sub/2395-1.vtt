03:33.491 --> 03:35.412
Good.

03:39.717 --> 03:42.577
My dad had three kids.

03:43.622 --> 03:47.126
Me, my sister, and the institute.

03:47.226 --> 03:50.345
That's just the way it was.
You knew that if you had a baseball game or,

03:50.445 --> 03:52.498
I don't know,
some sort of special event,

03:52.598 --> 03:55.228
there was always a good chance
he might not be there.

03:55.328 --> 03:58.137
I mean, don't get me wrong,
he was there a good amount of the time.

03:58.237 --> 04:00.303
Just not all the time.

04:02.206 --> 04:06.643
I remember I tried to trick him
into thinking I had ESP.

04:06.745 --> 04:09.648
Or that I was moving stuff
around with my mind,

04:09.748 --> 04:12.798
hoping it might get him to pay
a little more attention.

04:12.898 --> 04:16.254
And he'd play along
for a few minutes, but...

04:17.553 --> 04:19.654
then he'd leave for work.

04:20.858 --> 04:23.228
I was four... when it happened.

04:23.328 --> 04:26.231
So I don't have too many memories
of my father.

04:26.331 --> 04:29.101
I kinda remember
what it felt like to be with him.

04:29.808 --> 04:32.504
Talking with me, holding me.

04:32.904 --> 04:35.007
One thing I've always remembered
is this game we used to play

04:35.107 --> 04:37.576
on nights when he'd put me to bed.

04:37.676 --> 04:40.545
He'd ask all these questions
about animals.

04:40.645 --> 04:44.883
How many eyes does a fish have?
And I'd say, "Two."

04:44.983 --> 04:50.082
How many noses does a monkey have?
How many ears does a gopher have?

04:50.482 --> 04:52.190
That's really all there was to it.

04:52.290 --> 04:54.891
I remember thinking it was fun.

04:57.628 --> 05:01.166
We got married in 1965.

05:01.766 --> 05:04.150
I wanted children right away,
but Henry wanted to wait.

05:04.250 --> 05:07.539
'Cause it was about that time
that he was starting the institute.

05:07.839 --> 05:11.843
And then he had a different
research lab job

05:11.943 --> 05:14.913
at the same time so we could make rent.

05:15.113 --> 05:18.648
He worked a lot.
Even after we had both kids.

05:19.784 --> 05:21.723
But he loved it.

05:22.623 --> 05:23.855
You know?

05:23.955 --> 05:27.023
A man has the right to love his work.

05:34.098 --> 05:37.536
Our goal was to conduct unbiased,
empirical research

05:37.636 --> 05:40.405
on exceptional human abilities.

05:40.505 --> 05:42.741
Psychokinesis, ESP, precognition.

05:42.841 --> 05:47.379
Things that are typically considered
fringe science or parapsychology.

05:47.979 --> 05:51.650
Dr. West, and the rest of us,
quite frankly,

05:51.750 --> 05:56.052
all believed that there was real science
to be discovered in these areas.

05:58.289 --> 06:01.093
We had a good time doing
what we were doing.

06:01.493 --> 06:02.828
We were underfunded, of course,

06:02.928 --> 06:05.163
but we were still relatively young,
so it didn't matter.

06:05.263 --> 06:07.753
In the first few years alone,

06:07.853 --> 06:11.703
we published close
to 30 journal articles between us.

06:12.403 --> 06:14.606
And there were some
truly exceptional cases.

06:15.206 --> 06:17.640
All documented.

06:20.945 --> 06:23.482
Well, we did a lot of different
kinds of tests, but...

06:24.282 --> 06:28.353
probably the most effective one
to measure clairvoyant abilities

06:28.453 --> 06:30.455
were the Zener cards.

06:30.555 --> 06:32.221
This one?

06:34.558 --> 06:37.526
It's the lines. The wavy lines.

06:37.895 --> 06:39.932
Well, if you select each card at random,

06:40.032 --> 06:43.568
then the success ratio
will be close to 20%.

06:43.668 --> 06:49.941
But we had several subjects
whose ratio was closer to 30%.

06:50.041 --> 06:52.144
And that might not seem like very much,

06:52.244 --> 06:57.382
but if you realize that we
did each test over 200 times,

06:57.482 --> 07:02.351
you begin to understand
the virtual impossibility of that figure.

07:06.090 --> 07:09.761
I think we were all secretly
hoping to discover the next Nina Kulagina.

07:09.861 --> 07:13.865
She was a woman
from the former Soviet Union.

07:14.278 --> 07:16.275
Truly remarkable.

07:17.301 --> 07:21.072
Nina's psychokinetic abilities were
probably the most well-documented

07:21.172 --> 07:24.673
and they stood up
to the strictest of scrutiny.

07:26.310 --> 07:30.311
The closest we encountered
to that level was Norman LeClair.

07:30.411 --> 07:31.683
French-Canadian man.

07:31.983 --> 07:37.353
Norman's PK abilities
were astounding at times.

07:44.674 --> 07:47.766
That's how it works. Pretty simple?

07:48.233 --> 07:49.234
Yeah.

07:49.933 --> 07:52.034
Try to vibrate the game board.

08:03.814 --> 08:05.981
It's all right. Take your time.

08:12.289 --> 08:15.024
That's all right. You gave it your best shot.
We can try again later.

08:18.863 --> 08:20.823
Dr. West brought in colleagues,

08:20.923 --> 08:25.036
some well-known and esteemed
researchers at the time,

08:25.447 --> 08:29.474
to observe Norman.
All the necessary steps were taken

08:29.874 --> 08:33.912
to prevent any claims of researcher bias
or improper testing methods.

08:34.912 --> 08:39.551
All outside variables were controlled,
for this was to be the moment the snickering,

08:39.650 --> 08:43.522
the talking behind hands
would finally stop.

08:43.621 --> 08:46.022
This was proof.

08:58.736 --> 09:02.207
- God, I can't believe that.
- Explain that.

09:02.307 --> 09:05.341
- As we said.
- How do you explain that one?

09:33.939 --> 09:35.707
How do you explain that?

09:35.807 --> 09:38.143
- What do you guys think?
- Oh, my God.

09:38.343 --> 09:41.880
Oh, they were clearly impressed.
Even though, I'd have to say,

09:41.980 --> 09:44.916
they didn't really allow themselves
to show it.

09:45.216 --> 09:47.285
I was happy. I was happy for Henry.

09:47.385 --> 09:50.756
He had worked so hard for that moment.

09:51.656 --> 09:56.225
But then, just before
the researchers left...

09:56.527 --> 10:00.357
one of them noticed something odd
on the wristwatch

10:00.557 --> 10:04.736
of one of our research assistants.
And it turned out that this watch

10:04.836 --> 10:09.441
had been rigged with a small
neodymium magnet.

10:09.541 --> 10:14.746
And every one of our tests
involved metal in some capacity.

10:14.846 --> 10:18.481
Even the trace amounts of iron
in the cereal.

10:19.984 --> 10:23.922
And this guy had been complicit
with Norman's ruse right from the start.

10:24.022 --> 10:26.858
Right under our noses. It was...

10:27.058 --> 10:29.561
it was a crushing blow.

10:29.661 --> 10:32.197
For the institute's credibility

10:32.297 --> 10:34.866
and for Henry's reputation.

10:34.966 --> 10:37.766
It was... it was awful.

10:49.746 --> 10:51.607
Is there...

10:52.229 --> 10:55.338
something else we should know about?

10:55.438 --> 10:58.554
Judith? With you?

11:06.597 --> 11:08.665
It's like...

11:10.935 --> 11:14.870
it's like being in a well sometimes.

11:17.908 --> 11:21.210
I can see it, I can hear it,
but nobody knows I'm there.

11:28.252 --> 11:31.187
I'd... I'd like to help you.

11:32.289 --> 11:34.423
Whatever is going on.

11:36.326 --> 11:38.897
Judith was first brought
to the institute

11:38.997 --> 11:42.700
in September of 1976 by her sister...

11:43.000 --> 11:47.405
sister Margaret. She had been reading
about the work we were doing

11:47.505 --> 11:49.307
in a small magazine or something.

11:49.407 --> 11:53.311
And she thought we would be interested
in testing Judith.

11:53.411 --> 11:56.114
The first thing she did
when she walked in

11:56.214 --> 11:58.483
was she told me it was my birthday.

11:59.411 --> 12:01.820
Which caught me a bit off guard.

12:01.920 --> 12:05.522
Not because it was my birthday.
It wasn't, it was the day before.

12:05.622 --> 12:07.458
Maybe it was a guess.

12:07.558 --> 12:11.963
You see, that's something you always have
to guard against with the work we did.

12:12.063 --> 12:14.666
Lucky guesses. False positives.

12:14.766 --> 12:19.604
If you let yourself fall victim
to a belief bias of any kind,

12:19.704 --> 12:23.374
that's when you start forcing
the pieces together.

12:23.474 --> 12:25.975
Even when they don't fit at all.

12:29.213 --> 12:31.309
Judith...

12:32.016 --> 12:35.420
she seemed average.
She's in her early 40s.

12:35.520 --> 12:38.122
Can't say there's anything particularly
remarkable about her appearance.

12:38.222 --> 12:42.560
She was kind of the type of person that you
would pass by on the street in any town.

12:42.660 --> 12:45.595
You might say hello, smile,
but that's about it.

12:47.631 --> 12:50.335
You would have no idea

12:50.535 --> 12:52.801
that Judith was what she was.

13:00.043 --> 13:02.614
I was older than her by seven years.

13:02.714 --> 13:05.316
She was a silly kid.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.746
And we had a lot of fun.

13:10.420 --> 13:13.391
There was one day, she was around 35,

13:13.921 --> 13:18.128
she slipped on a patch of ice
on the sidewalk

13:18.228 --> 13:21.029
and hurt her back pretty badly.

13:22.432 --> 13:26.036
And after that,
she had a little trouble moving,

13:26.168 --> 13:28.230
and getting around.

13:28.330 --> 13:32.243
And her pain was consistent.

13:32.789 --> 13:34.245
It was chronic.

13:35.293 --> 13:37.482
It was enough
that my husband and I decided

13:37.582 --> 13:39.851
that she shouldn't be
living alone anymore.

13:39.951 --> 13:42.423
So she moved in with us and the kids.

13:43.554 --> 13:48.793
About a year after Judith moved in,
she began to withdraw.

13:48.893 --> 13:52.197
I mean, she would stay
in her room for days.

13:52.752 --> 13:55.166
I'm not sure she would even eat.

13:55.766 --> 13:59.301
I don't know what she did
when she was alone.

13:59.436 --> 14:04.008
She was reading some very unusual books.

14:04.108 --> 14:08.055
And that's when it all started.
And I knew things weren't right.

14:08.713 --> 14:10.845
There were things...

14:11.560 --> 14:14.585
there were things that I saw her do

14:14.686 --> 14:16.755
that I just...

14:17.655 --> 14:19.915
I had to do something.

14:22.192 --> 14:27.463
And to this day, part of me still regrets
doing what I did, but I had to.

14:31.268 --> 14:35.506
But Dr. West was intrigued with Judith
almost immediately. We all were.

14:36.306 --> 14:38.409
By this point, we'd researched
hundreds of cases,

14:38.509 --> 14:41.477
brought in almost as many
subjects into the lab.

14:44.147 --> 14:45.581
Judith was different, though.

14:46.750 --> 14:50.185
We just had no idea
how different at this point.

15:00.891 --> 15:03.030
Can you tell us your name, please?

15:03.856 --> 15:07.371
- Judith Winstead.
- And what's your date of birth, Judith?

15:07.643 --> 15:10.008
February 18th, 1935.

15:10.108 --> 15:12.786
And your marital status?

15:12.886 --> 15:16.318
- I'm not married.
- Have you ever been?

15:16.818 --> 15:19.345
Okay. How many siblings do you have?

15:20.216 --> 15:23.919
- One.
- Are your parents still alive?

15:26.957 --> 15:28.793
- Judith, are your parents still alive?
- No.

15:28.893 --> 15:32.494
Okay. Are you right-handed
or left-handed?

15:32.896 --> 15:37.001
Judith's behavior was always odd.
Even from the first day she arrived.

15:37.791 --> 15:40.405
But in our field, it wasn't uncommon
to encounter odd people.

15:40.505 --> 15:42.471
So we didn't give it much thought.

15:44.341 --> 15:46.377
Ms. Winstead?

15:47.266 --> 15:49.071
Right-handed.

15:49.880 --> 15:54.617
And when did you first realize
you had certain abilities?

15:58.462 --> 16:00.658
Are you... are you all right, dear?

16:01.993 --> 16:03.400
You're bleeding.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.274
Oh, my God.

16:05.845 --> 16:08.833
- Here's some...
- Give her some towels.

16:09.233 --> 16:11.769
Oh, tilt your head back, okay?

16:12.194 --> 16:13.738
It's not her nose, it's her hand.
Her hand is bleeding.

16:13.838 --> 16:17.606
What? Did you... did you bite yourself?

16:19.576 --> 16:21.279
Why?

16:21.779 --> 16:24.382
Susan, let's get her...
get her to the ladies' room, please.

16:24.482 --> 16:26.451
As long as you're okay with it.

16:26.951 --> 16:30.353
- That's all right. Just take...
- Just take care of her.

16:32.522 --> 16:34.025
Judith?

16:34.825 --> 16:37.295
What is she... no, no, no.
What is she doing? Stop.

16:37.395 --> 16:39.431
- Just stop. Calm down.
- Let go.

16:39.531 --> 16:42.200
Ms. Winstead. Judith, stop, please.

16:43.149 --> 16:46.981
Well, for starters,
Judith came to us in an unusual way.

16:47.081 --> 16:50.141
Most times, we learn of someone
and seek them out.

16:50.641 --> 16:52.441
We had no idea Judith
was even out there.

16:54.711 --> 16:59.748
Nevertheless, she tested beyond
what any of us thought was even possible.

17:01.718 --> 17:03.855
There was no measure.

17:04.155 --> 17:07.656
Truly no measure for her abilities.

17:09.459 --> 17:12.928
If you can, try for seven this time.
Any combination.

17:15.053 --> 17:16.590
Three and four.

17:18.272 --> 17:20.238
One and six.

17:21.887 --> 17:23.772
Three and four.

17:24.810 --> 17:26.885
One and six.

17:29.408 --> 17:31.514
Two and five.

17:33.649 --> 17:36.152
Judith, what I'd like you to try to do
is to move the wheel

17:36.252 --> 17:38.487
without actually touching it.

17:40.857 --> 17:45.160
Try to concentrate your mind.
Focus your thoughts.

17:52.135 --> 17:54.605
She outperformed every subject
we'd ever studied.

17:54.705 --> 17:57.573
There was no comparison to be made.

17:58.875 --> 18:03.477
I understand how peculiar it might seem
to hear her abilities described in this way,

18:03.577 --> 18:06.233
but they were godlike.

18:13.590 --> 18:16.024
Okay, Judith, what do you see this time?

18:18.594 --> 18:21.002
- Judith?
- Star.

18:23.500 --> 18:26.501
- And this time.
- Square.

18:29.288 --> 18:31.408
And what do you see this time?

18:34.578 --> 18:36.180
Judith, are you all right?

18:36.280 --> 18:40.148
Are you all right, Judith? Do you...
can we continue with the exercise?

18:41.451 --> 18:42.720
- I think she's...
- Judith?

18:42.820 --> 18:46.621
I think she's okay. All right,
let's resume. Judith, what...

18:48.158 --> 18:50.292
- The card bent.
- What?

18:51.661 --> 18:54.063
- That card bent. We're taking a break.
- What do you mean?

18:55.265 --> 18:56.999
Dr. West?

19:01.418 --> 19:03.105
Looking back, I...

19:04.207 --> 19:06.474
I guess I should've known better.

19:07.177 --> 19:09.752
I mean, yes, we'd seen...

19:09.852 --> 19:13.448
witnessed amazing things in the past.

19:14.050 --> 19:17.586
But nothing like that.
Nothing, nothing like that.

19:19.589 --> 19:23.694
Inverse square law.
Conservation of momentum.

19:23.794 --> 19:27.899
These were well-established laws
of physics that were being violated.

19:27.999 --> 19:31.342
The second law of thermodynamics.
All of these.

19:31.942 --> 19:34.083
We should've been scared.

19:34.237 --> 19:37.005
Someone with that much power would...

19:37.774 --> 19:39.939
but we were too excited to be scared.

19:40.039 --> 19:42.413
We finally had the proof...

19:42.713 --> 19:46.982
not another hoax...
that we'd been seeking for years.

19:48.218 --> 19:51.587
We had our Nina Kulagina.

20:01.731 --> 20:04.368
What I remember, she was due to...

20:04.468 --> 20:07.238
stay overnight in the lab
through the weekend.

20:07.338 --> 20:10.708
We did this quite often with subjects
because anomalous events

20:10.808 --> 20:13.744
sometimes occur
during the deep-sleep cycle.

20:14.044 --> 20:18.981
And we monitored the subjects through
the night using various recording devices.

20:24.220 --> 20:29.293
During Judith's first overnight, we only had
one staff member present. Kenneth.

20:30.154 --> 20:33.030
I don't ever think I knew his last name.

20:33.230 --> 20:36.667
He was a graduate student
at the time. Nice, quiet kid.

20:36.767 --> 20:39.435
Came from a farming family.
I remember that because so do I.

20:41.771 --> 20:43.282
He was...

20:43.850 --> 20:47.278
he was alone with Judith that night
sitting not far from her bed.

20:47.878 --> 20:50.548
I don't even think he knew
that he was being recorded

20:50.648 --> 20:55.450
because you can see him smoking which
he wasn't supposed to be doing in the lab.

20:56.786 --> 20:58.987
Nothing happened for hours.

21:59.949 --> 22:02.484
Nobody ever found out what happened.

22:04.053 --> 22:05.854
But whatever did...

22:07.390 --> 22:09.393
that was it for him.

22:09.593 --> 22:11.384
Never came back.

22:34.117 --> 22:38.255
We tried contacting
Judith's sister, Margaret.

22:38.355 --> 22:40.455
We couldn't reach her.

22:40.990 --> 22:43.027
She'd disconnected her phone.

22:43.662 --> 22:46.631
It became clear at that moment...

22:46.731 --> 22:49.464
that Margaret had abandoned her.

22:51.568 --> 22:53.371
The decision now was
what we were gonna do.

22:53.471 --> 22:55.673
I could tell that Lawrence was already
reaching a bit of a breaking point.

22:55.773 --> 22:57.501
It was obvious.

22:58.842 --> 23:00.909
It wasn't so obvious with Dr. West.

23:02.145 --> 23:03.912
Not to me anyway.

23:07.250 --> 23:12.415
We simply made the decision that we were
going to continue our testing with her.

23:12.790 --> 23:15.066
But after that night,

23:15.166 --> 23:17.366
it became extremely difficult.

23:18.862 --> 23:21.732
It was so unnerving.

23:22.032 --> 23:25.722
Her behavior. It was so incredibly...

23:26.737 --> 23:32.006
She... she would say things
and do things that made you...

23:32.542 --> 23:35.413
She would scream in that voice.

23:35.713 --> 23:37.275
Grab her!

23:38.748 --> 23:40.606
It wasn't hers.

23:41.006 --> 23:42.981
It was like an animal.

23:44.821 --> 23:47.191
Henry seemed most affected by it.

23:47.491 --> 23:50.995
He tried his best to shield
the others from that.

23:51.293 --> 23:53.910
I knew him well enough to know that

23:54.010 --> 23:56.731
he was deeply affected.

24:00.269 --> 24:02.070
I watched my father change firsthand.

24:03.306 --> 24:06.610
And I have no doubt whatsoever
that what happened in that lab

24:06.769 --> 24:08.846
caused that change.

24:09.855 --> 24:13.751
I remember being
in the seventh grade years later,

24:13.951 --> 24:16.418
and other kids making fun of me.

24:17.487 --> 24:21.089
Call him crazy. They'd say I'd be crazy.

24:22.826 --> 24:26.330
Back then, it was different
than it is now.

24:26.530 --> 24:29.133
Now everyone has a therapist.

24:29.233 --> 24:33.037
They go for anything...
stubbed toe. But back then,

24:33.337 --> 24:36.805
you went if it was something bad.

24:41.177 --> 24:44.982
And especially if medication
was involved.

24:45.082 --> 24:47.682
And in my husband's case, it was.

24:52.595 --> 24:56.126
- Why do you say that, Henry?
- You don't understand.

24:56.226 --> 24:57.730
Okay.

24:58.635 --> 25:01.697
- I see what's happening.
- At work?

25:03.667 --> 25:05.836
I can't help you if you don't tell me

25:05.936 --> 25:08.536
- what you think is happening.
- I can't tell you.

25:10.139 --> 25:12.545
What are you so afraid of, Henry?

25:19.115 --> 25:21.051
I know it's very trying,

25:21.151 --> 25:23.854
but we would really like to continue.

25:24.600 --> 25:28.089
- Can you please stop that, Judith?
- Can you please stop that, please?

25:29.792 --> 25:31.996
We'd really like to continue...

25:32.596 --> 25:35.940
We had about 10 different
degrees between us.

25:36.040 --> 25:39.736
Including one in medicine,
three in psychology.

25:40.108 --> 25:42.140
And we knew...

25:43.040 --> 25:46.174
that was not normal.

25:48.278 --> 25:50.948
Judith was not a typical test subject.

25:51.048 --> 25:54.018
She had made that
abundantly clear by that point.

25:55.146 --> 25:58.554
And I felt we needed help.

26:06.562 --> 26:08.499
I received a file from another analyst.

26:08.599 --> 26:10.934
It was something he thought
I should take a look at.

26:11.034 --> 26:15.072
We started a program
to investigate psi in the early '70s.

26:15.172 --> 26:20.242
Psi-related phenomenon. About five years
after KGB conducted similar studies.

26:22.545 --> 26:25.816
I didn't have the highest
expectations going in.

26:25.916 --> 26:28.652
I felt we'd already been down that road.

26:28.752 --> 26:31.642
And it proved to be a waste
of time and money.

26:31.742 --> 26:35.156
But Marcus was a friend
of a friend, and so I went.

26:36.993 --> 26:39.294
It's difficult to explain.

26:41.230 --> 26:44.032
But you could feel something...

26:46.002 --> 26:49.404
a weight, an invisible weight.

26:50.740 --> 26:53.310
The whole lab took on that feeling

26:53.410 --> 26:55.577
the minute he stepped through the door.

26:57.080 --> 27:02.052
It was if he represented a challenge
to her, to her power.

27:02.452 --> 27:05.189
Everything we had seen
up until that point,

27:05.289 --> 27:08.092
everything Judith had done,
everything we'd witnessed,

27:08.992 --> 27:12.763
it barely compared
to what happened after he arrived.

27:13.263 --> 27:16.266
I assumed they'd run through
the usual battery of psi tests.

27:16.366 --> 27:20.437
The cards, the elaborate devices
with the numbers, but they didn't.

27:20.937 --> 27:24.505
They told me that those tests
weren't right for her.

27:27.955 --> 27:29.680
This here's a way to convince anyone.

27:29.880 --> 27:34.816
Easiest and simplest way
to begin the demonstration.

27:57.073 --> 27:59.710
Now you understand
why we've called you in here.

27:59.810 --> 28:02.246
That can't be accounted for

28:02.346 --> 28:06.549
through any known rational explanation.

28:06.649 --> 28:09.053
And she's able to repeat it
with a variety of different materials.

28:09.153 --> 28:11.286
Breaking the third law
of thermal dynamics.

28:19.362 --> 28:24.434
By the time the man from the Defense
Intelligence Agency, Robert Koepp, arrived,

28:24.534 --> 28:26.437
we'd given up on our standard
testing procedure.

28:27.634 --> 28:29.637
Well, we'd simply talked to her.

28:32.241 --> 28:34.409
It was so difficult.

28:36.312 --> 28:37.946
She knew...

28:40.349 --> 28:42.050
too much.

28:43.886 --> 28:45.322
Think of any object.

28:45.422 --> 28:47.391
- Something in the room?
- No, it doesn't have to be.

28:47.491 --> 28:49.159
No, let's make it something
not in the room.

28:49.259 --> 28:51.693
- Okay.
- Okay.

28:53.196 --> 28:54.663
Draw what you see, please.

29:11.981 --> 29:15.417
- And what object were you thinking of?
- A hammer.

29:22.658 --> 29:25.128
- Excuse me.
- Susan?

29:25.228 --> 29:27.631
- Susan.
- Henry, she...

29:28.431 --> 29:29.700
You don't frighten me!

29:29.800 --> 29:32.169
- You don't fucking know!
- Susan! Stop it!

29:32.269 --> 29:34.472
- What are you doing?!
- Marcus!

29:34.572 --> 29:36.207
- Susan, calm down.
- How dare you?!

29:36.307 --> 29:38.108
- You don't know anything!
- Take her outside, please.

29:38.208 --> 29:40.244
Just take her outside.

29:40.644 --> 29:42.044
She had drawn a shamrock.

29:45.181 --> 29:47.251
Back in 1973, three years earlier,

29:47.351 --> 29:50.370
I had traveled back to London
for my mum's funeral.

29:50.470 --> 29:53.310
I was devastated.

29:56.458 --> 29:58.862
Her family had immigrated
to London from Ireland

29:58.962 --> 30:02.597
and she was very proud
of her Irish heritage.

30:03.499 --> 30:06.603
And in her casket, she had worn
the same brooch that she'd worn

30:06.703 --> 30:09.337
almost every day of her life.

30:11.140 --> 30:13.551
It was a shamrock.

30:14.511 --> 30:16.601
As soon as I saw that picture,

30:16.701 --> 30:19.680
I realized what Judith
had whispered to me.

30:20.783 --> 30:23.351
"You weren't there."

30:24.921 --> 30:27.390
Which is true, I wasn't.

30:27.850 --> 30:30.992
My mother died the day
before I made it home.

30:33.029 --> 30:35.132
And that woman...

30:36.432 --> 30:38.613
that thing somehow knew that.

30:38.713 --> 30:42.003
And how much guilt.

30:43.472 --> 30:45.075
She wanted me to behave that way.

30:45.475 --> 30:47.442
She wanted me to react that way.

30:48.844 --> 30:50.681
To humiliate me in front of my peers

30:50.781 --> 30:54.615
by turning me into everything
I had tried so hard not to be.

31:01.290 --> 31:05.062
Well, the incident with Susan
was very unsettling

31:05.162 --> 31:08.855
because it demonstrated
Judith's ability to influence us.

31:08.955 --> 31:11.301
She was definitely influencing Henry.

31:11.701 --> 31:15.038
He started to pull back.
Which was unlike him.

31:15.138 --> 31:18.308
I thought he was gonna fight
the government's involvement,

31:18.508 --> 31:20.195
but that didn't happen.

31:20.295 --> 31:23.745
He withdrew and they took over.

31:46.769 --> 31:48.513
My arm!

31:49.972 --> 31:51.329
Use the strap right there.

31:51.429 --> 31:54.342
Please, step back.
You're gonna break her arm.

31:57.313 --> 31:58.914
- Please, step back.
- What are you giving her?

32:05.488 --> 32:07.055
Tell Robert.

32:38.220 --> 32:42.790
Heartbeat's back again. Mark it.
14 minutes and 27 seconds.

32:44.427 --> 32:49.166
- Any physical deterioration?
- Nothing. Jesus.

32:49.566 --> 32:51.935
She's pissing again. Get the towels.

32:52.135 --> 32:54.269
It's over there. Get it.

32:58.007 --> 33:00.329
- No.
- That's good. Thank you.

33:00.429 --> 33:02.243
Step back.

33:07.216 --> 33:08.883
Check her! Make sure she's all right!

33:10.519 --> 33:11.568
Not that, that.

33:13.822 --> 33:16.617
Once they witnessed
the things we'd all seen,

33:16.717 --> 33:18.617
it became a very different scenario.

33:19.195 --> 33:23.333
It didn't matter what my preconceived
notions were before visiting the institute.

33:23.433 --> 33:26.336
What mattered now was national security.

33:26.936 --> 33:28.605
We left nothing to chance.

33:28.705 --> 33:33.009
All evidence was thoroughly reviewed
by top Defense Department analysts.

33:33.209 --> 33:36.746
Tissue samples were extracted.
Blood samples taken.

33:36.846 --> 33:39.883
Plans were immediately
put in place to contain the situation.

33:39.983 --> 33:41.485
The institute was locked down.

33:42.085 --> 33:46.056
We assumed control of all testing
and information collection.

33:46.156 --> 33:48.825
Strict security protocols
were put in place.

33:49.225 --> 33:51.194
This was a coordinated military effort

33:51.294 --> 33:54.197
with support from the highest levels
of the government.

33:54.697 --> 33:59.369
Soldiers were stationed around the clock
inside the lab, all of them armed.

34:00.286 --> 34:03.106
We were there because we believed it.

34:03.206 --> 34:05.373
Now we wanted to see it.

34:07.376 --> 34:09.079
The camera's ready.

34:09.179 --> 34:12.246
- Lights ready.
- Flashing.

34:30.364 --> 34:33.003
I think he's having a seizure. Henry?

34:33.103 --> 34:35.237
- Get a hand under his head.
- Turn the lights on.

34:35.338 --> 34:38.208
- Keep his mouth open.
- Turn the lights on!

34:39.246 --> 34:40.641
Where is she?

34:45.715 --> 34:47.315
Stop the flashing now!

34:51.485 --> 34:53.790
The DIA report prompted swift action.

34:53.889 --> 34:57.928
We looked at the evidence, we reviewed
the footage of the seizure incident.

34:58.128 --> 35:01.898
Dr. West had no history of epilepsy
or any related condition,

35:01.998 --> 35:05.769
so it's highly unlikely that the flashing
lights could've triggered it.

35:06.328 --> 35:11.576
We could not say definitively that
Ms. Winstead caused the seizure,

35:11.676 --> 35:14.244
but we certainly couldn't
rule it out either.

35:15.063 --> 35:19.096
Several meetings were held to discuss
the seriousness of this threat.

35:19.548 --> 35:23.469
I can't speak to the specifics
of what was discussed,

35:23.869 --> 35:26.464
but suffice it to say
if you're gonna inform the White House

35:26.564 --> 35:30.591
of something as crazy as this,
you better be damn sure it's true.

35:33.763 --> 35:38.735
All psychological and pharmacological
explanations were ruled out.

35:38.835 --> 35:43.206
Her blood samples came back
with impossibly high electrolyte levels.

35:43.506 --> 35:48.511
A completely unknown molecular compound

35:48.611 --> 35:50.978
was found in her tissue.

35:51.847 --> 35:53.883
Something was inside her.

35:53.983 --> 35:55.954
No doubt about that.

35:56.654 --> 35:58.578
Not a disease.

35:58.678 --> 36:00.557
Not a parasite.

36:01.027 --> 36:02.757
An evil.

36:17.139 --> 36:20.408
Do you think you know
what caused the seizure?

36:22.311 --> 36:24.747
- Henry?
- Yes.

36:24.847 --> 36:27.417
- Are you taking the new medication?
- It has nothing to do with that.

36:27.517 --> 36:31.422
- Henry, it is important that you keep...
- I am taking it.

36:32.522 --> 36:35.122
I'm seeing things at night.

36:36.958 --> 36:40.930
I can't stop thinking about everything.

36:41.230 --> 36:43.330
I try, but...

36:46.135 --> 36:48.969
And even when I'm with
my family, I feel it.

36:51.473 --> 36:52.740
I'm afraid.

36:54.476 --> 36:57.478
I'm afraid of what might happen to them.

36:59.047 --> 37:01.382
But, yes, I am taking
the new medication.

37:04.586 --> 37:09.693
The story was that when the KGB
learned about Nina Kulagina's ability,

37:09.793 --> 37:14.598
they performed a test with a living frog.
This was back in 1970.

37:14.998 --> 37:18.702
The Soviets wanted to see
if Nina could telekinetically affect

37:18.802 --> 37:22.072
the bioelectrical impulses
in living tissue.

37:22.172 --> 37:25.008
To speed up and slow down its heartbeat.

37:25.208 --> 37:27.911
And allegedly, she did.

37:28.711 --> 37:33.381
So our government wanted to see if they
could replicate those results with Judith.

38:21.930 --> 38:23.731
Good God.

38:25.534 --> 38:27.019
Jesus.

38:30.939 --> 38:34.042
- Why's he barking?
- It's her. She's still doing it.

38:40.716 --> 38:44.486
She's doing it to the dog. No, her!

38:47.591 --> 38:50.357
Turn on the lights! Turn on the lights!

38:52.242 --> 38:53.954
Where is she?

38:54.963 --> 38:58.168
Secure this room now. Right now!

38:59.268 --> 39:02.005
- Quiet. Quiet.
- Turn on the lights!

39:02.105 --> 39:05.239
Quiet! Everyone, quiet.

39:09.286 --> 39:11.012
Don't move.

39:18.418 --> 39:20.743
- Robert, what's happening?
- Take it down.

39:20.843 --> 39:24.125
Quiet. Quiet.

39:28.864 --> 39:30.634
Marcus.

39:33.236 --> 39:35.172
- Nobody move. Nobody move.
- Who's touching me?

39:35.272 --> 39:36.954
Turn on the light!
Turn on the light now.

39:37.054 --> 39:38.640
- Turn it on.
- Turn that light back on.

39:47.783 --> 39:49.283
Grab her!

40:18.614 --> 40:21.217
Imagine being 22, 23 years old,

40:21.317 --> 40:24.352
best shape of your life,
armed to the teeth.

40:25.821 --> 40:27.418
And you scared of some lady looked like

40:27.518 --> 40:30.018
she could've been
your primary school teacher.

40:31.133 --> 40:33.627
That's what was going on then.

40:34.596 --> 40:36.480
You understand?

40:37.600 --> 40:40.834
Things took a significant
turn after that.

40:41.703 --> 40:44.207
I think in total, there were...

40:44.307 --> 40:48.678
six or seven unexplainable
incidents that occurred.

40:48.778 --> 40:51.212
All outside the institute.

40:52.581 --> 40:56.019
One of the government researcher's
cousins almost died in a car wreck.

40:56.119 --> 40:59.422
There was... a soldier's father
was attacked by a dog.

40:59.522 --> 41:02.325
There was a house fire,
if I remember correctly.

41:02.425 --> 41:05.159
And on and on it went.

41:05.894 --> 41:08.031
Now, each of these things
on their own could be a coincidence,

41:08.131 --> 41:10.333
but the likelihood that all of them
would happen together

41:10.433 --> 41:15.739
to the family and friends of this same group
of people in the same span of time

41:15.839 --> 41:18.641
is astonishingly low.

41:19.041 --> 41:23.077
My son Jeffrey started
waking up night after night

41:23.177 --> 41:25.648
screaming with night terrors.

41:25.748 --> 41:28.384
My wife and I found out that

41:28.484 --> 41:31.421
that was common among toddlers.

41:32.421 --> 41:34.228
I don't know.

41:34.328 --> 41:39.126
I don't know if it is or not.
It was... it was so eerie.

41:41.763 --> 41:43.471
I just...

41:46.968 --> 41:51.104
I was starting to think that maybe
my work was following me home.

41:51.873 --> 41:54.711
I felt bad for Sarge.

41:55.111 --> 41:57.947
His father got bit up
real bad by some stray.

41:58.047 --> 42:00.086
Pit bull, I think.

42:00.186 --> 42:02.354
And let me tell ya,

42:02.854 --> 42:04.727
she knew.

42:05.220 --> 42:09.489
The day after that,
she kept staring at him.

42:09.725 --> 42:12.462
He hadn't told any one of us.

42:12.562 --> 42:15.364
Nobody knew for about another week.

42:15.612 --> 42:16.666
But she knew.

42:17.736 --> 42:21.835
The whole time, she knew.

42:25.874 --> 42:28.475
It was late one night in the lab.

42:30.745 --> 42:33.794
And I happened to notice
a paper clip on the floor

42:33.894 --> 42:37.551
inside the air lock portion
of Judith's enclosure.

42:38.687 --> 42:42.125
Now, that environment was meticulously kept.
It was nearly sterile.

42:42.225 --> 42:46.060
So there was no explaining
how it got there.

42:48.597 --> 42:50.117
Anyway...

42:51.167 --> 42:55.705
I picked it up, I stuffed it in my pocket
and didn't give it another thought.

42:56.005 --> 43:00.242
We were at my sister's house
for my nephew's birthday.

43:00.935 --> 43:04.511
My wife and I never had kids,
so Matthew was very dear to us.

43:06.948 --> 43:09.385
And I remember reaching for my keys

43:09.485 --> 43:12.381
and thinking I heard something
fall onto the ground

43:12.481 --> 43:14.487
from my pocket.

43:19.060 --> 43:21.162
It was the paper clip.

43:29.172 --> 43:30.440
Burt, knock it off.

43:30.540 --> 43:33.078
- Claire, it's Matt!
- What?!

43:33.278 --> 43:34.332
Matthew!

43:34.434 --> 43:36.379
Oh, my God!

43:36.579 --> 43:38.081
Matthew? Matthew?

43:38.181 --> 43:40.748
- Oh, my God! Sweetheart!
- He's not breathing!

43:44.252 --> 43:46.916
He'd stuck it in a wall socket.

43:49.558 --> 43:52.562
I could've worn any other pants that day,
but I wore those.

43:52.662 --> 43:55.796
And that paper clip just happened
to be what he found?

43:57.365 --> 44:00.069
Out of all the things in the world,
a balled-up receipt, a stick of bubble gum...

44:00.169 --> 44:03.973
that's what happened to fall out
of my pocket at that moment?

44:04.673 --> 44:06.843
Not at any point
in the five days before that?

44:06.943 --> 44:10.680
Not... not anywhere else?
Not in... not in the hamper?

44:10.780 --> 44:13.819
In the washing machine?
In the dryer? There?

44:13.919 --> 44:16.449
On his birthday?

44:18.486 --> 44:21.988
And the way the dog was barking,
it was... it was... it was like...

44:25.794 --> 44:27.974
What happened...

44:28.374 --> 44:30.384
was no accident.

44:34.369 --> 44:36.670
That was it. I'd had enough.

44:37.539 --> 44:40.183
It was 10 years until I heard
from Lawrence again.

44:40.283 --> 44:43.810
He and his wife moved out of the country
shortly after it happened.

44:45.714 --> 44:49.150
I was surprised he didn't leave
the institute sooner than he did.

44:50.585 --> 44:53.153
It was a shame
what happened to his nephew.

44:55.924 --> 44:58.759
I don't think Lawrence
ever really forgave himself.

45:00.395 --> 45:04.266
Well, we couldn't discount the events
that happened outside the institute.

45:04.366 --> 45:07.124
Too much happened
for it to be coincidence.

45:07.224 --> 45:10.570
But what it did do is make us
rethink our strategy.

45:15.010 --> 45:17.512
What are we gonna use to immobilize her?

45:17.612 --> 45:18.748
Fentanyl.

45:18.848 --> 45:21.951
The gas derivative of it should
knock her out in seconds.

45:22.051 --> 45:24.120
It could also kill her.

45:24.829 --> 45:28.524
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. No, no, no.
- Hey. You can't keep her in there.

45:28.624 --> 45:32.228
- Now's not the time for compassion.
- She's a human being.

45:32.328 --> 45:34.764
There are laws against
that sort of treatment for a reason.

45:34.864 --> 45:36.633
Who do you think makes those laws?

45:36.733 --> 45:39.302
- This is my lab.
- No, not anymore it's not.

45:39.402 --> 45:41.300
I have sat back and kept quiet...

45:41.400 --> 45:44.738
- while I've seen you...
- And you'd do well to stay quiet.

45:49.645 --> 45:51.480
Get him outta here.

45:51.580 --> 45:53.950
I never should've called you people.

45:54.050 --> 45:55.783
Hold on.

45:58.620 --> 46:01.688
You really think
you're equipped to handle this?

46:03.658 --> 46:07.928
Your little lab here with your flash cards
and ESP machines?

46:12.367 --> 46:14.001
See it...

46:23.111 --> 46:25.145
but then it's gone.

46:28.116 --> 46:30.580
Now it comes back. You can...

46:31.251 --> 46:33.569
see that in the rest of the pictures.

46:37.092 --> 46:39.460
For those few moments...

46:41.529 --> 46:43.497
it wasn't in the room.

46:45.633 --> 46:48.001
Might not even been in the building.

46:51.506 --> 46:53.940
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

46:56.177 --> 47:01.214
We don't control this,
it's not just us who will be at risk.

47:04.686 --> 47:07.223
And if you do control it,

47:07.323 --> 47:09.656
then who will be at risk?

47:24.339 --> 47:29.910
We recognized the danger of allowing it
to remain even remotely unrestricted.

47:31.746 --> 47:34.383
It was immensely powerful.

47:34.783 --> 47:38.257
And rather than continually
try to explain it,

47:38.357 --> 47:42.188
the decision was made
to attempt to harness it.

47:48.129 --> 47:50.158
Repeat the following:

47:50.258 --> 47:53.767
one, two, three, four, five.

47:57.772 --> 48:01.577
Your instructions are clear.
Repeat the following:

48:01.677 --> 48:05.282
one, two, three, four, five.

48:10.318 --> 48:12.533
You will cooperate.

48:20.315 --> 48:21.809
Now,

48:21.909 --> 48:26.391
this is a map divided into a grid
consisting of five sections.

48:26.491 --> 48:29.405
One, two, three, four, five.

48:29.505 --> 48:33.843
I want you to listen carefully
and concentrate.

48:34.469 --> 48:38.016
There are artillery and biological
weapons being stored

48:38.116 --> 48:42.451
somewhere in this region.
Look at the grid

48:42.551 --> 48:46.119
and tell me the number of where.

48:50.025 --> 48:53.493
Tell me where they're being stored.

48:56.998 --> 49:00.734
You will cooperate. Put it away.

49:07.875 --> 49:12.006
Part of me...
will always feel responsible.

49:13.281 --> 49:16.716
Because it was my idea
to notify the military.

49:19.654 --> 49:23.436
I don't know what we would've
done otherwise. But...

49:24.136 --> 49:28.110
I do wonder if Henry
might still be alive today if...

49:28.610 --> 49:30.863
I had settled on a more...

49:32.467 --> 49:36.169
reasonable solution.

49:42.317 --> 49:44.078
Sergeant.

49:46.914 --> 49:48.747
Do you hear me?

49:50.518 --> 49:52.050
Ms. Winstead,

49:52.150 --> 49:57.791
your instructions are to make
Sergeant Parella say exactly the following:

49:58.426 --> 50:01.405
reposition all nuclear submarines

50:01.505 --> 50:03.726
out of the Baltic Sea.

50:04.537 --> 50:06.402
Once again,

50:06.502 --> 50:09.690
reposition all nuclear submarines

50:09.790 --> 50:12.564
out of the Baltic Sea.

50:19.581 --> 50:22.449
Your instructions are clear.

50:38.421 --> 50:41.005
- How many eyes does a fish have?
- Turn up his volume.

50:41.105 --> 50:43.801
How many ears does a gopher have?

50:43.901 --> 50:46.374
How many noses does a monkey have?

50:46.474 --> 50:49.110
How many arms does a whale have?

50:49.210 --> 50:51.446
How many hoofs does a horse have?

50:51.548 --> 50:53.849
- How many noses does a monkey have?
- Dr. West?

50:53.949 --> 50:56.085
- How many stripes does a zebra have?
- Dr. West.

50:56.185 --> 50:58.354
How many eyes does a fish have?

50:58.454 --> 51:00.623
How many ears does an elephant have?

51:00.723 --> 51:03.332
How many stripes does a zebra have?

51:03.592 --> 51:06.059
How many eyes does a fish have?

51:06.594 --> 51:08.264
- How many eyes does a fish have?
- Henry.

51:09.820 --> 51:12.285
- How many noses does a monkey have?
- Dr. West.

51:12.385 --> 51:15.004
How many noses does a monkey have?

51:15.104 --> 51:17.839
How many noses does a monkey have?

51:17.939 --> 51:20.454
How many noses does a monkey have?

51:20.554 --> 51:24.144
How many noses does a monkey have?
How many noses...

51:27.548 --> 51:29.257
You can't control something like that.

51:30.486 --> 51:34.521
I don't care who you are,
how many weapons you have.

51:35.490 --> 51:37.957
All those things that went on...

51:41.196 --> 51:43.933
you don't get to play games
with the Devil.

51:44.033 --> 51:47.233
And if you do, you damn sure
don't get to make the rules.

51:50.805 --> 51:52.975
That type of evil...

51:53.464 --> 51:55.586
just thinking about it,

51:55.686 --> 51:57.786
talking about it.

51:58.880 --> 52:01.550
Even you people making this movie...

52:01.750 --> 52:04.053
and the people watching it...

52:04.532 --> 52:06.755
you're inviting

52:07.043 --> 52:10.123
bad things into your life.

52:14.115 --> 52:16.129
Too late for me.

52:17.098 --> 52:19.511
All the things I've seen.

52:26.701 --> 52:30.713
This wasn't like the books or the movies
or false accounts you hear about.

52:31.013 --> 52:34.984
If those cases were legitimate,
I can assure you, we would've intervened.

52:35.551 --> 52:39.555
This is real.
There was no speculative data.

52:39.655 --> 52:42.645
There was no charlatans
looking to make a buck.

52:42.745 --> 52:47.827
This was the only governmentally
confirmed case of possession.

52:48.696 --> 52:52.968
Arguably the most significant thing we learned
was that it had an intelligence.

52:53.068 --> 52:57.773
That meant that it was able to conduct
some form of cost-benefit analysis.

52:57.873 --> 53:01.377
Our plan was to utilize
its ability to reason

53:01.477 --> 53:04.914
as a stopgap measure to clear
a psychological pathway.

53:05.314 --> 53:09.919
So they essentially offered it a choice
between cooperating or suffering.

53:10.019 --> 53:13.419
But it was a false choice
because both options

53:13.519 --> 53:16.091
caused Judith to suffer.

53:16.191 --> 53:20.658
Their belief was that if they
could control her physical body,

53:20.758 --> 53:22.809
chiefly her mind,

53:23.309 --> 53:26.532
they could control
how the force manifested.

53:27.302 --> 53:30.137
Possess the possession

53:30.639 --> 53:32.105
is what they would say.

53:33.675 --> 53:36.242
As if it was gonna work that way.

53:38.981 --> 53:40.745
Clear, go again.

54:13.247 --> 54:16.435
They pushed that poor woman
to her limits.

54:16.535 --> 54:19.855
Judith Winstead, the person.

54:20.186 --> 54:23.389
I felt... terrible for her.

54:23.991 --> 54:26.226
But there was nothing
we could do to help her.

54:35.437 --> 54:37.940
Please, stop.

54:38.040 --> 54:39.675
Please, stop.

54:39.775 --> 54:44.012
We were eventually able to devise
a method of governing the force.

54:44.412 --> 54:48.584
Once we controlled her,
we could effectively control it.

54:48.684 --> 54:50.652
Once that happened,

54:50.752 --> 54:54.021
the nature of our involvement
changed dramatically.

55:52.647 --> 55:54.409
It was...

55:54.975 --> 55:56.612
shocking.

55:57.885 --> 56:00.465
But it wasn't at the same time.

56:00.788 --> 56:03.156
We knew something was coming.

56:05.559 --> 56:08.227
I mean, a few nights before that, I...

56:09.797 --> 56:13.866
found him curled up in a ball
under the bathroom sink.

56:15.002 --> 56:17.740
Talking to himself.

56:18.240 --> 56:20.075
Crying.

56:20.748 --> 56:23.379
I mean, he was scared to death.

56:25.930 --> 56:28.550
Henry was nearing the end of his rope.

56:28.850 --> 56:32.755
After a while, he rarely even
set foot in the lab.

56:33.055 --> 56:36.825
He would lock himself in the office
for hours at a time.

56:36.925 --> 56:40.593
Sometimes you could hear him
muttering from behind the door.

56:41.929 --> 56:44.471
Things were reaching a tipping point.

56:46.050 --> 56:49.004
I do. I do believe that it drove
Dr. West to that.

56:49.370 --> 56:53.242
Trust me. We did a complete
background check. We knew everything.

56:53.542 --> 56:56.442
We knew about the therapy,
the medication.

56:57.812 --> 57:00.880
What happened was not
a product of psychosis.

57:05.656 --> 57:09.355
Maybe you should take
some time away from work.

57:10.391 --> 57:12.628
Henry? Maybe take some time off?

57:12.728 --> 57:14.596
It doesn't matter where I am.
It's everywhere.

57:14.696 --> 57:17.699
It's like a shadow.
Except it's not mine.

57:17.799 --> 57:19.968
So you feel like it's following you,
the shadow.

57:20.068 --> 57:22.337
I feel like it's already caught me.

57:22.551 --> 57:26.101
To be totally honest, Henry,
I find a lot of this very troubling.

57:26.201 --> 57:27.810
Is that why you're using that?

57:27.910 --> 57:30.946
- Yeah, we always record the sessions.
- Not on a camera.

57:31.046 --> 57:33.582
Well, I... things seem different.

57:33.682 --> 57:36.484
- Did they make you do this?
- Did who?

57:36.584 --> 57:39.495
- Is this to make sure I don't say anything?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

57:39.595 --> 57:44.257
They're pushing it too far. They want
to control everything, but they can't.

57:44.357 --> 57:47.695
It's too powerful. It's too strong.

57:47.795 --> 57:49.498
Take it easy, Henry.

57:49.598 --> 57:53.567
I'm trying to make you understand.
There's something happening.

57:57.471 --> 57:59.875
- To you?
- Yes.

58:01.155 --> 58:04.179
To me, then maybe to you,
then maybe to them.

58:04.279 --> 58:06.546
Whoever it chooses.

58:07.882 --> 58:12.018
There's no science left in the world
for this, but they think there is.

58:14.388 --> 58:16.658
It doesn't even matter anymore
what I say.

58:16.758 --> 58:19.494
It's gonna speak for itself.
So use your goddamn camera.

58:19.594 --> 58:22.531
Write my name.
Write my words across the sky.

58:22.631 --> 58:25.331
I don't give a damn because if it...

58:25.983 --> 58:29.035
if they keep pushing it
the way they are...

59:04.639 --> 59:06.907
Nod if you can hear me.

59:11.281 --> 59:12.681
Good.

59:12.781 --> 59:16.652
What I want you to do now is focus
on the person on the television.

59:16.752 --> 59:18.785
Nod if you understand.

59:23.357 --> 59:25.458
I want you to tell me his name.

59:30.481 --> 59:32.067
Your instructions are clear.

59:32.167 --> 59:35.235
Tell me the name of the person
you see on the television.

59:40.808 --> 59:42.534
Alan.

59:42.934 --> 59:44.607
Turcott.

59:51.252 --> 59:54.587
Next, I want you to tell me
his current location.

59:55.890 --> 59:56.813
Hanscom.

59:59.760 --> 01:00:03.229
Office. Military office.

01:00:13.107 --> 01:00:14.941
Let's get them on the phone.

01:00:21.815 --> 01:00:24.694
- Tell them we're gonna try it out.
- We're gonna try it out.

01:00:29.189 --> 01:00:30.525
They're ready.

01:00:30.625 --> 01:00:33.294
Listen very carefully
to what I'm gonna tell you.

01:00:33.394 --> 01:00:37.999
What I want you to do now is attempt
to influence Private Turcott's breathing.

01:00:38.199 --> 01:00:39.265
Begin.

01:00:48.909 --> 01:00:51.210
Your instructions are clear.

01:01:15.237 --> 01:01:16.738
- Tell her to stop it.
- Stop it.

01:01:16.838 --> 01:01:18.473
- Tell her to stop!
- Stop.

01:01:19.174 --> 01:01:20.642
I said stop!

01:01:21.626 --> 01:01:22.943
Hit her!

01:01:35.222 --> 01:01:37.259
We eventually figured out
what was going on.

01:01:37.359 --> 01:01:40.028
And we felt so foolish
for not having recognized

01:01:40.128 --> 01:01:43.731
that that was the government's
intention from the beginning.

01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:45.955
To weaponize her.

01:01:46.155 --> 01:01:49.771
Having the ability
to remotely collect intel.

01:01:50.171 --> 01:01:52.240
To be able to read
the minds of foreign leaders

01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:55.477
to know exactly
what their plan of attack is.

01:01:55.777 --> 01:01:58.947
Where they were and what they were
thinking at any given moment.

01:01:59.347 --> 01:02:01.951
And, if necessary,

01:02:02.651 --> 01:02:06.588
be able to collapse their lungs
and stop their hearts.

01:02:06.888 --> 01:02:09.724
All from thousands of miles away.

01:02:09.824 --> 01:02:11.927
We were looking at the future
of clandestine warfare.

01:02:12.027 --> 01:02:15.030
Where attacks could be as strategic

01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:18.033
and as untraceable as we saw fit.

01:02:18.133 --> 01:02:21.036
The rigors of their testing protocol
increased enormously.

01:02:21.136 --> 01:02:24.339
The more they pushed,
the more defiant she became.

01:02:24.439 --> 01:02:27.974
Well, it became.

01:03:03.610 --> 01:03:07.716
We treated her like the discovery
of any new destructive force.

01:03:08.016 --> 01:03:10.588
Much of what we did mirrored
the testing procedures

01:03:10.688 --> 01:03:13.388
used in the early atomic testing.

01:03:13.488 --> 01:03:17.891
We needed to understand this power
if we were intent on utilizing it.

01:03:32.139 --> 01:03:33.640
What are you?

01:03:44.652 --> 01:03:46.386
How do you choose your host?

01:03:56.930 --> 01:03:58.366
Now.

01:04:11.668 --> 01:04:13.715
Tell me your name.

01:04:28.559 --> 01:04:29.899
They were getting very frustrated

01:04:29.999 --> 01:04:33.234
because everything she said
sounded like gibberish.

01:04:33.534 --> 01:04:34.936
They kept shocking her.

01:04:35.236 --> 01:04:37.439
When she didn't give them the answer
they wanted, they'd shock her again.

01:04:37.539 --> 01:04:39.674
They'd up the voltage
and shock her again.

01:04:40.574 --> 01:04:43.361
Our analysts were eventually
able to isolate

01:04:43.461 --> 01:04:46.751
certain elements of Judith's speech.

01:04:47.794 --> 01:04:51.184
Turned out she hadn't been
speaking gibberish at all.

01:05:07.968 --> 01:05:09.120
What are you?

01:05:14.307 --> 01:05:16.476
How do you choose your host?

01:05:22.283 --> 01:05:24.758
This will all be over soon.

01:05:30.624 --> 01:05:35.266
It just proved that she was
in control the entire time.

01:05:35.366 --> 01:05:38.600
Just drawing us in.
Drawing us in closer.

01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:44.259
And instead of stopping like we all knew
we should, we kept going.

01:05:44.906 --> 01:05:49.477
We were too close to something
truly revolutionary to stop.

01:05:49.577 --> 01:05:54.282
It was affecting everyone, but that's
the nature of any struggle, any battle.

01:05:54.382 --> 01:05:57.318
Push and you will be resisted.

01:05:57.418 --> 01:06:00.689
That's why you want to be
the one pushing the hardest.

01:06:01.129 --> 01:06:04.636
You would hear them discussing new ideas
and strategies, disruption techniques,

01:06:04.836 --> 01:06:07.629
but nobody would talk
about what was obvious.

01:06:07.929 --> 01:06:12.207
That there are certain things in this world
that we will never understand.

01:06:12.307 --> 01:06:14.767
And Judith Winstead was one of them.

01:06:20.607 --> 01:06:26.321
It was acutely averse to all things
related to religion.

01:06:26.421 --> 01:06:29.248
Even more than it was to electroshock.

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:35.357
And that poor priest...

01:06:36.125 --> 01:06:38.527
he was just a pawn.

01:06:39.127 --> 01:06:41.596
We were very much against
involving the Church.

01:06:41.896 --> 01:06:44.032
We didn't want to turn this
into a sideshow.

01:06:44.432 --> 01:06:48.434
At the same time,
we had to gain control somehow.

01:06:51.151 --> 01:06:52.905
This one, too.

01:07:01.048 --> 01:07:03.082
Thumbprint on that one as well.

01:07:15.429 --> 01:07:17.933
- Do you understand everything?
- I do, yes.

01:07:18.033 --> 01:07:20.166
Into the camera, please.

01:07:21.035 --> 01:07:23.071
I understand.

01:07:23.471 --> 01:07:24.994
Okay.

01:07:41.989 --> 01:07:44.392
Do you have any questions?

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:46.158
No.

01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:51.164
Good.

01:07:56.303 --> 01:07:58.885
That last night in the lab was...

01:07:58.985 --> 01:08:01.008
it was crazy.

01:08:01.108 --> 01:08:04.212
They told us to double up
on our ammo just to stay safe.

01:08:04.312 --> 01:08:08.948
There was a big buildup. Everyone was
mentally preparing for what might happen.

01:08:11.218 --> 01:08:15.190
We needed to get it out of the lab
and we couldn't do that with a civilian.

01:08:15.590 --> 01:08:18.323
We had to transfer it
into one of our own.

01:08:21.962 --> 01:08:26.432
When I arrived at the lab that night
and found out what was going to happen...

01:08:28.602 --> 01:08:30.368
I froze.

01:08:32.372 --> 01:08:36.441
I wanted to scream for them
not to try that.

01:08:37.644 --> 01:08:39.814
But I didn't say a word.

01:08:40.314 --> 01:08:42.950
I wanted to get out of there real bad.

01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:45.733
I remember, I wanted
to sneak out the back door

01:08:45.832 --> 01:08:48.886
when nobody was looking and just go.

01:08:53.225 --> 01:08:55.340
And of course I couldn't.

01:08:57.831 --> 01:08:59.765
I should've.

01:10:10.588 --> 01:10:13.121
- Go ahead.
- Copy that.

01:10:13.859 --> 01:10:15.398
Get ready, Corporal.

01:10:58.185 --> 01:11:00.019
Hey, hey, hey.

01:11:19.673 --> 01:11:20.840
Stop the transfer.

01:11:24.945 --> 01:11:28.347
The power of the blood
of Jesus commands you!

01:11:28.815 --> 01:11:30.452
Bow to the Lord!

01:11:31.352 --> 01:11:32.387
Get him out of there.

01:11:32.487 --> 01:11:35.387
- Hit the gas. Hit the gas.
- Help! Help!

01:11:58.645 --> 01:11:59.580
Pull him out!

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:02.581
Pull him out. Make sure he's okay.

01:12:03.250 --> 01:12:05.384
Are you okay?

01:12:07.187 --> 01:12:09.989
- I'm gonna clear it.
- No. No, no, no. Hold on.

01:12:15.395 --> 01:12:18.964
- Did it work? Did it work?
- I... I don't know.

01:12:21.401 --> 01:12:23.569
Give her a quick charge.

01:12:26.673 --> 01:12:28.309
She's still out.

01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:31.577
No, no. The electrodes
got disconnected. See?

01:12:36.116 --> 01:12:38.384
Shit.

01:12:50.130 --> 01:12:51.766
- Are you positive she's unconscious?
- No.

01:12:51.866 --> 01:12:53.935
- Can we gas her again?
- It might be too much.

01:12:54.035 --> 01:12:55.503
Well, I'm not going in there
unless I know she's completely...

01:12:55.603 --> 01:12:58.373
- Then don't go in there.
- If we don't get those electrodes...

01:12:58.473 --> 01:12:59.766
- Are you crazy?
- We've got nothing if it's dead.

01:12:59.866 --> 01:13:02.077
- Hit her again! Now!
- I'm not gonna hit her again.

01:13:02.177 --> 01:13:04.377
- Hit her again!
- Don't...

01:13:07.247 --> 01:13:09.048
Robert, don't.

01:14:35.935 --> 01:14:37.770
Bilateral?

01:14:39.172 --> 01:14:40.806
Bi-frontal.

01:15:44.337 --> 01:15:46.241
What are you doing? What are you doing?
You need to step back.

01:15:46.341 --> 01:15:48.075
I'm gonna check him.
I'm gonna check his pulse.

01:15:48.175 --> 01:15:49.341
- That's it?
- That's all.

01:15:58.985 --> 01:16:00.019
Let's start clearing again...

01:16:16.186 --> 01:16:19.004
Get him outta here. Let's go.
Come on. Let's go.

01:16:22.001 --> 01:16:25.712
The situation was a disaster
in all possible ways.

01:16:25.812 --> 01:16:29.116
Local law enforcement
got involved, the media.

01:16:29.216 --> 01:16:31.359
They all wanted to know
what happened, naturally.

01:16:31.459 --> 01:16:33.761
They had a right to the story.

01:16:33.861 --> 01:16:36.090
Just not to all of it.

01:16:36.190 --> 01:16:39.940
I'm still not at liberty to discuss
much more than I have.

01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:43.831
Especially as it pertains to the events
that took place after that night.

01:16:43.931 --> 01:16:46.567
But I can tell you this...

01:16:46.667 --> 01:16:50.602
the measures taken were done with the best
interests of this country in mind.

01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:56.444
It wasn't until fairly recently

01:16:56.544 --> 01:17:00.948
that I found out
what happened to my sister.

01:17:01.448 --> 01:17:05.252
And as horrible as it probably sounds,

01:17:05.352 --> 01:17:07.382
I preferred it that way.

01:17:07.482 --> 01:17:10.658
She was a good person. She was.

01:17:11.058 --> 01:17:13.258
But people change.

01:17:14.444 --> 01:17:16.161
Even good people.

01:17:18.538 --> 01:17:21.635
I know that the official story
was that he was crazy.

01:17:21.735 --> 01:17:25.087
He was a mad scientist
who had finally lost

01:17:25.187 --> 01:17:28.854
the last of his widely
scattered marbles.

01:17:30.043 --> 01:17:32.513
But believe me when I tell you,

01:17:33.013 --> 01:17:36.948
Henry West was not crazy.

01:17:38.951 --> 01:17:41.119
Which I suppose...

01:17:42.188 --> 01:17:45.886
leaves us
with the alternate explanation.

01:17:59.839 --> 01:18:01.940
What is this?

01:18:34.157 --> 01:18:36.008
Please, help.
