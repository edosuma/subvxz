WEBVTT

00:02.600 --> 00:05.500
- Oh, man. Come on.
- I'm telling you, leaving Mom alone

00:05.600 --> 00:07.700
in our apartment every
afternoon is a bad idea.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.600
Well, until you teach Emma
to order in Chinese,

00:09.700 --> 00:10.800
somebody's
got to feed her.

00:12.500 --> 00:14.400
Don't worry, you won't
even know Mom was here.

00:14.500 --> 00:16.400
Too late.
Yesterday, she found time

00:16.400 --> 00:18.800
to go through my nightstand and
tidy up my protection center.

00:21.200 --> 00:23.700
Your mom organized
your love drawer?

00:25.500 --> 00:27.400
Mom has this thing
about boundaries.

00:27.500 --> 00:28.600
She has none.

00:31.500 --> 00:33.700
So, Captain Action,
( Chuckles )

00:33.800 --> 00:35.500
How much longer
do you think

00:35.500 --> 00:37.400
your new lady friend
is gonna be in the shower?

00:37.400 --> 00:40.300
Okay, if I'm late, Vanessa
will have my head in a jar.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.400
Really?
Just your head?

00:43.700 --> 00:45.700
I thought the plan was
to break up with Vanessa?

00:45.700 --> 00:47.600
I tried.

00:47.600 --> 00:49.600
Not using
actual words, but...

00:50.700 --> 00:52.500
Man, I did think it
really hard though.

00:52.500 --> 00:53.700
( Rustling )

00:53.700 --> 00:55.800
Mom also baby-proofed
all the cabinets.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.600
I'm telling you--
bad idea.

00:57.700 --> 00:58.800
But we need her
to watch Emma,

00:58.800 --> 01:00.500
so we're gonna have to
make some adjustments.

01:00.500 --> 01:01.600
Good morning.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.300
Oh, like remembering
to wear pants.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.800
So how did my baby sleep?

01:06.800 --> 01:08.500
Pretty good.

01:08.500 --> 01:09.700
I meant Emma.

01:11.300 --> 01:12.600
How did
she get in here?

01:12.600 --> 01:13.700
Oh, thanks
for the key, honey.

01:13.800 --> 01:15.700
It's gonna make this
so much easier.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.500
Tucker and Danny:
You gave her a key?

01:19.600 --> 01:21.500
She gave me life.
( Chuckles )

01:23.600 --> 01:26.400
- But yeah, I probably shouldn't
have done that.     - No.

01:26.400 --> 01:27.600
{Y:i}( Theme music playing )

01:27.700 --> 01:30.600
{Y:i}d It's amazing how
{Y:i}the unexpected d

01:37.500 --> 01:38.600
What is the matter
with you?

01:38.600 --> 01:40.300
You can't give Mom
a key to our apartment.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.800
That means she can
whenever she wants

01:41.800 --> 01:43.600
and do whatever--
Mom, where you going?

01:43.700 --> 01:45.500
- To wash my hands.
- Oh, use the kitchen.

01:45.600 --> 01:46.700
Why? What's wrong
with the bathroom?

01:46.800 --> 01:48.800
We're having some trouble
with the door,  it's stuck.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.500
Mom, you're not supposed to be
here for another five hours.

01:53.500 --> 01:55.500
Oh, I know.
I'm sorry,

01:55.500 --> 01:57.800
but Emma and I had
so much fun yesterday,

01:57.800 --> 02:00.400
that I signed us up
for a "Grandma and Me" class.

02:00.400 --> 02:03.400
( Laughs ) Well, actually
it's a "Mommy and Me" class,

02:03.500 --> 02:05.700
but come on,
I mean, huh, aah.

02:07.500 --> 02:09.300
And today it is

02:09.400 --> 02:11.700
ballerina tutu day.

02:11.700 --> 02:13.300
( Chuckling )

02:13.400 --> 02:14.800
Oh, this just
reminds me

02:14.800 --> 02:17.300
of how badly
I wanted a little girl.

02:17.300 --> 02:19.500
Mm. I swear, I must
have cried for two days

02:19.600 --> 02:21.500
after I saw your penis
on the ultrasound.

02:24.700 --> 02:26.800
Really has
no boundaries.

02:26.800 --> 02:28.700
Granted, you really
had to look for it,

02:28.700 --> 02:31.500
but once I found it,
you know, it's...

02:31.500 --> 02:32.700
{Y:i}( Pounds on door )

02:32.700 --> 02:33.800
Still working
on the door.

02:33.800 --> 02:34.800
( Chuckles )

02:34.800 --> 02:36.600
Maybe I'll just go
hose off out back.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.400
Okay.

02:38.400 --> 02:41.400
- You know, Mom... ( Chuckles )
- Oh.

02:41.400 --> 02:43.300
...the mornings are kind of
my only time with Emma.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.800
I told her that we were
gonna go to the park and--

02:44.800 --> 02:46.400
Well, honey,
she's a baby.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.700
She doesn't even know
what a park is.

02:48.700 --> 02:49.600
Mom.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.500
You don't have
to say it.

02:51.600 --> 02:52.800
You're welcome.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.400
I just know
if we all pull together,

02:57.400 --> 02:59.500
we will do right
by that little girl.

02:59.500 --> 03:00.600
Now where is

03:00.700 --> 03:02.600
my little pumpkin?

03:03.600 --> 03:05.600
Oh, and, Danny?

03:05.600 --> 03:07.600
Let that poor woman
out of the bathroom.

03:09.700 --> 03:11.400
I think Emma's
a little young

03:11.500 --> 03:13.400
to see her first
Booty call.

03:16.600 --> 03:19.400
And here's another good thing
about having Mom watch Emma--

03:19.400 --> 03:20.700
more bro time.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.400
Get the key.

03:23.500 --> 03:25.500
Who's the nozzle
talking to Riley?

03:25.500 --> 03:26.600
Law school buddy.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.600
They've been hitting
the books pretty hard lately.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.800
Looks like he's interested in
hitting more than the books.

03:32.300 --> 03:33.500
You think?

03:33.500 --> 03:34.800
Well, good for
Riley, right?

03:36.600 --> 03:37.700
Wrong.

03:38.700 --> 03:40.300
Thank you, counselor.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.400
I look forward
to our next sidebar.

03:42.500 --> 03:44.300
I wouldn't
object to that.

03:44.400 --> 03:45.500
- ( Chuckles )
- Ooh.

03:53.700 --> 03:54.700
Oh, hey, Danny.

03:54.700 --> 03:55.700
Hey.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.500
Uh, you just missed
my friend, Jack.

03:57.500 --> 03:58.800
I've been
tutoring him.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.400
In what?

04:00.400 --> 04:01.500
Blushing, flirting,

04:01.500 --> 04:03.400
hair flipping?

04:03.400 --> 04:05.700
Okay. It's a lot
harder than it looks.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.300
He's kind of cute,
right?

04:09.300 --> 04:11.600
That isn't really the kind
of guy you like, is it?

04:11.700 --> 04:13.500
Fancy-ass lawyer
wannabe?

04:13.500 --> 04:16.300
Well, since
smooth-talking bartenders

04:16.399 --> 04:17.600
don't really seem
to be interested--

04:17.700 --> 04:19.800
yeah, I'm looking
elsewhere.

04:19.800 --> 04:22.300
Then maybe you
should keep looking.

04:22.300 --> 04:23.600
Why do you care
if I like Jack?

04:23.600 --> 04:25.300
I don't care.
( Chuckles )

04:25.300 --> 04:26.500
Why would I care?

04:26.500 --> 04:28.300
But maybe someone
else cares.

04:28.300 --> 04:30.300
And what kind of message
is that to send them?

04:30.300 --> 04:31.800
Those people
who care.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.600
Okay. Well, I'll, uh,

04:35.600 --> 04:37.400
keep that in mind.
Thanks.

04:39.500 --> 04:40.600
( Mouths )

04:43.500 --> 04:44.700
Would any of those

04:44.700 --> 04:46.600
people who care

04:46.600 --> 04:48.400
happen to be
in this bar?

04:48.500 --> 04:50.500
Maybe.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.500
So you're saying
that this person

04:52.500 --> 04:53.800
might actually
be interested?

04:53.800 --> 04:55.500
He might be.

04:55.600 --> 04:58.500
So I should stop
flirting with Jack?

04:58.500 --> 05:00.400
That one's
a definite yes.

05:01.700 --> 05:04.300
Message received.
Thank you, Danny.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.700
- Oh, hey, Tuck.
- Oh, hey.

05:14.500 --> 05:15.700
How long
were you there?

05:15.700 --> 05:17.400
Long enough.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.700
( Chuckles )
Okay. So...

05:21.400 --> 05:23.400
( Grunts,
chuckles )

05:23.400 --> 05:25.500
I'm curious.

05:25.500 --> 05:26.700
See, I'm pretty sure

05:26.700 --> 05:29.300
that Ben's not
really into Riley,

05:29.300 --> 05:32.300
so I wonder
who at this bar is?

05:32.300 --> 05:34.600
( Chuckles nervously )
It could be anyone.

05:34.600 --> 05:35.700
Anyone?

05:37.700 --> 05:40.400
- Quit smiling.
- Oh, I don't think

05:40.400 --> 05:41.800
I'm ever going
to quit smiling.

05:49.500 --> 05:51.700
Really? Again?

05:53.400 --> 05:54.500
You know,
you might have

05:54.600 --> 05:55.700
a better shot
with Riley

05:55.700 --> 05:57.400
if you didn't offer
free showers

05:57.400 --> 05:58.600
to every girl
on the Lower East Side.

05:59.700 --> 06:03.300
For the 100th time,
I don't like Riley.

06:03.300 --> 06:05.400
And whoever's in there,
she isn't mine.

06:08.400 --> 06:09.500
Who's got Emma?

06:09.600 --> 06:11.300
Good morning.

06:11.300 --> 06:13.600
Oh! Pajamas--
got to get me some.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.700
- Did you spend the night?
- Oh, don't be silly.

06:17.700 --> 06:19.400
I just know how early
Emma wakes up,

06:19.500 --> 06:21.300
so I thought you might
like to sleep in.

06:21.400 --> 06:23.300
Oh, and the drain's
a little backed up.

06:23.400 --> 06:26.300
Sorry. I think some of my
extensions might have come out.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.500
Oh, well, I better go
pull them out of the drain

06:30.500 --> 06:32.400
before Ben gives
them a key, too.

06:33.700 --> 06:36.400
And I'm late for the rink.
Coach wants me to practice

06:36.400 --> 06:38.800
- some of my {Y:i}key moves.
- Subtle.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.800
So, Mom, you're here
awfully early.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.700
- Again.
- Well, I have to be.

06:45.700 --> 06:47.500
You've seen the line
for this shower.

06:51.300 --> 06:52.600
Well, I really
didn't get to see her

06:52.600 --> 06:54.500
before she went
to bed last night and--

06:54.500 --> 06:55.700
isn't it great
she's on a schedule?

06:55.800 --> 06:57.800
Oh, terrific.
( Chuckles )

06:57.800 --> 06:59.800
But since I work
in the afternoons,

06:59.800 --> 07:01.600
when you
oh so graciously offered

07:01.700 --> 07:04.700
to watch her for that oh
so brief window of time,

07:04.700 --> 07:06.700
I assumed I'd see her
in the mornings.

07:06.700 --> 07:09.300
And now you've got
your mornings free.

07:09.400 --> 07:12.600
Oh! How I wish
I had a me

07:12.600 --> 07:15.500
when I was
raising you. Oh.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.400
And I wish I had a you
that could take a hint.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.300
Did you say
something, honey?

07:23.300 --> 07:24.500
- Oh, no, Mom. No.
- Okay.

07:26.000 --> 07:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:33.400 --> 07:35.400
And finally my day
gets a little brighter.

07:35.500 --> 07:36.800
Oh, thank you.

07:36.800 --> 07:39.400
- Is something wrong?
- No, just my mom.

07:40.700 --> 07:43.400
- Are you meeting Jack?
- No. Why?

07:43.400 --> 07:44.700
Oh, you look
a little dressed up.

07:45.700 --> 07:46.700
Three hours
every other afternoon,

07:46.800 --> 07:48.300
that's all I needed.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.600
Do you think that
I'm going out with Jack?

07:49.600 --> 07:51.500
- Because I'm not.
- Oh, too bad.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.500
I have her a key, and now
she's practically moved in.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.700
- Why too bad?
- Oh, I just thought you guys looked good together.

07:55.700 --> 07:57.300
And I never get
to see Emma.

07:57.400 --> 07:58.700
So you're saying
I should go out with Jack?

07:58.700 --> 08:00.300
Why not?
That's what I told Danny.

08:00.300 --> 08:01.400
That's what
you told Danny?

08:01.400 --> 08:02.400
Yeah, but I can't
talk to her.

08:02.500 --> 08:03.700
I've never been able
to talk to her.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.300
But I have no choice.
I just have to

08:05.400 --> 08:06.500
sit her down and lay out
some boundaries, right?

08:06.500 --> 08:08.200
Not right.
Why would he do that?

08:08.300 --> 08:09.300
- Who?
- Danny.

08:09.300 --> 08:10.300
I meant my mom.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.500
So do you think I should
talk to her tonight?

08:11.500 --> 08:12.600
You can't.
She has book club.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.300
Yes, my palms are
starting to sweat.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.400
So just so we're clear,
you have no issues

08:16.500 --> 08:17.700
with me throwing myself
at Jack?

08:17.700 --> 08:19.400
Actually sounds like
a pretty good idea.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.600
Most guys are
fairly clueless.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.600
( Chuckles )
Yeah.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.300
I'm getting that.

08:26.600 --> 08:29.300
Hey, look, I know the last few
days have been a little rough,

08:29.300 --> 08:31.400
so I hope this free pony
keg from the beer guy

08:31.400 --> 08:33.500
and some slightly-expired meat
from the bar kitchen

08:33.500 --> 08:35.400
will let you know
how truly sorry I am.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.500
Hey, I'm just glad
you got rid of Mom.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.400
- Wish I could have heard that go down.
- ( Laughs )

08:42.900 --> 08:44.600
You did talk to her,
right?

08:46.800 --> 08:49.400
How good do
those steaks smell?

08:49.400 --> 08:51.300
Like they're trying
to change thsubject.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.400
Well...
( Laughs )

08:52.500 --> 08:53.600
I can't believe
you can't stand up

08:53.700 --> 08:56.300
- to your own mother.
- {Y:i}( Cell phone rings )

08:56.300 --> 08:58.500
( Annoyed ) Oh, g-- can
we not go five minutes

08:58.600 --> 09:00.500
- without talking?
- ( Beeps )

09:00.500 --> 09:02.400
( Sweetly )
Hey, Vanessa.

09:02.400 --> 09:03.600
Oh, I miss you, too.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.700
- Tucker's right, bro.
- {Y:i}( Vehicle approaches )

09:08.700 --> 09:10.600
Does that minivan
look familiar to you?

09:11.600 --> 09:13.400
Both:
Mom! Go!

09:13.500 --> 09:14.500
- Oh!
- Okay.

09:16.700 --> 09:18.400
Ah!

09:18.400 --> 09:21.200
- Get the bag!
- Okay. Right.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.500
( Elevator dings )

09:35.600 --> 09:36.600
Emma!

09:36.700 --> 09:39.400
Look what your grandma
brought you.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.600
It's a bunny the size
of your daddy's roommate.

09:51.400 --> 09:52.600
- Hi.
- Oh, thank God you're home.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.000
No phone, no wallet-- we
really had nowhere else to go.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.500
What's going on?
Is everything okay?

09:56.600 --> 09:57.800
No. Mom showed up again.

09:58.900 --> 09:59.900
She's got to learn
that she can't

10:00.000 --> 10:01.400
just barge in unannounced
and ruin our evening.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.600
Oh. So you're
teaching her a lesson

10:04.600 --> 10:06.700
by barging in unannounced
and ruining my evening.

10:06.700 --> 10:09.400
Exactly.
No, I mean...

10:09.500 --> 10:10.800
( Scoffs ) It's not like
you had any plans, right?

10:10.800 --> 10:13.500
Hey, what's with the wine?

10:13.500 --> 10:15.400
And the candles?

10:15.400 --> 10:17.400
And the cleavage?

10:19.900 --> 10:21.200
Oh, hey.

10:21.300 --> 10:23.000
Jack--
Jack Parker.

10:23.100 --> 10:25.100
- I go to school with--
- And the man in your bathroom?

10:26.200 --> 10:27.300
Jack, Danny.

10:27.300 --> 10:29.300
Danny, Jack.
Jack, Ben.

10:29.300 --> 10:31.000
Ben, Jack.
They're just old friends

10:31.100 --> 10:32.100
who stopped by
to show off their new baby.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.300
Yeah, you're such
a cute baby.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.000
Okay, thanks
so much, bye.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.300
- Bye.
- So you threw yourself

10:36.300 --> 10:37.900
at him, after all, huh?

10:38.000 --> 10:39.900
Glad to see you
took my advice.

10:39.900 --> 10:42.300
You're welcome, counselor.
{Y:i}( Riley chuckles )

10:42.400 --> 10:44.000
Don't pay attention
to anything

10:44.000 --> 10:45.300
that Ben says,
because he's crazy.

10:45.300 --> 10:46.900
New baby, doesn't get
a lot of sleep,

10:46.900 --> 10:48.200
you know. Here.
Here, have some cheese.

10:48.300 --> 10:50.900
Wine and cheese?
Are you coming on to me?

10:50.900 --> 10:53.900
Stand by.
( Chuckles )

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
Did you hear that?
Hmm? Ben's advice?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.300
Hey, man.
Really sorry for messing up

10:58.400 --> 11:00.000
the obligatory
small talk portion

11:00.100 --> 11:01.100
- of the evening, but...
- ( Chuckles )

11:01.200 --> 11:02.200
I just gotta
change a diaper.

11:02.200 --> 11:03.200
And feed her.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.900
Don't forget
we need to feed her.

11:04.900 --> 11:05.900
Is that okay?

11:06.000 --> 11:07.100
Fine.
Just be quick please.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.300
( Scoffs ) You won't
even know we're here.

11:10.100 --> 11:12.900
This is exactly
why I need to be here.

11:12.900 --> 11:14.100
{Y:i}I'm gone
{Y:i}for two seconds,

11:14.100 --> 11:16.100
and they've got Emma
out past her bedtime.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.100
God knows where,
doing God knows what?

11:18.200 --> 11:19.900
"Hi, Ben."

11:20.000 --> 11:21.100
I'm trapped
with your mom.

11:24.100 --> 11:27.100
Where are you?
I hate you.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.100
"Call me."

11:30.100 --> 11:32.200
Do you expect me to believe that
you don't know where they are?

11:32.200 --> 11:35.100
Know how you can tell?
If I did, I'd be with them.

11:37.100 --> 11:39.100
Well, until you dig up
some information,

11:39.200 --> 11:41.200
it's just you, me
and the clock.

11:41.300 --> 11:43.000
Tick, tock, Tucker.

11:44.100 --> 11:47.100
Wow. Really wish
I could hang around,

11:47.100 --> 11:50.200
but you know what?
I was just on the phone with Vanessa

11:50.200 --> 11:52.200
before you got here--
which is totally true.

11:52.300 --> 11:54.000
And, um, she said

11:54.100 --> 11:55.900
she'd like me
to come on over, so--

11:56.000 --> 11:57.900
haven't you broken up
with her yet?

11:59.100 --> 12:00.300
- How do you know about--
- Oh, everyone knows.

12:02.900 --> 12:04.000
Well, maybe
I'll do it tonight.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.900
Let me give you
a little advice,

12:05.900 --> 12:07.200
tuck-a-doodle-do.

12:09.900 --> 12:12.800
All women
really want to hear

12:12.900 --> 12:15.300
is the truth.
We can take it.

12:15.300 --> 12:18.000
We're tough.
Look at me.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.100
You can tell me
anything.

12:21.100 --> 12:24.000
- I still don't know where they are.
- Oh!

12:26.100 --> 12:28.200
As soon as she wakes up,
we're out of here, I swear.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.200
Oh, well, what are we waiting for?
Wake her up.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.000
How was I supposed to know
you were on a date?

12:34.100 --> 12:36.200
Oh, I'm sorry. Next time
I'll put a sock on the door.

12:38.100 --> 12:40.000
So, you and Riley--

12:40.000 --> 12:41.200
what's that about?

12:41.300 --> 12:43.300
Nothing yet,
but she's smart,

12:43.300 --> 12:45.100
and funny.

12:45.100 --> 12:46.900
And obviously
very attractive.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.100
Well, you should have
seen her in high school.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.900
She was ginormous.
Hey, Riles?

12:50.900 --> 12:52.100
You got a copy
of your yearbook around here?

12:52.100 --> 12:54.100
I don't think so.
What is the matter with you?

12:54.100 --> 12:55.200
I'm just
checking him out

12:55.300 --> 12:57.000
to make sure he's
good enough for you.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.200
Well, how about
I do the inspection

12:58.300 --> 12:59.900
and get back
to you?

13:02.100 --> 13:03.200
Look.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.300
I know you're terrified
of talking to your mom,

13:05.300 --> 13:07.000
but just be honest.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.900
Tell her the truth.

13:08.900 --> 13:11.000
That's really all
any girl wants to hear.

13:14.100 --> 13:15.800
I was kind of afraid
to tell you this,

13:15.800 --> 13:18.100
but Emma threw up
on your comforter.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.900
No-- no, V-Baby.

13:21.900 --> 13:23.900
I'm just saying,
I think we need to talk.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.200
Yeah. Okay.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.000
No no no, I'm just--

13:27.100 --> 13:29.200
no no.
We've just been really--

13:29.200 --> 13:31.300
- if you could just let me speak--
- Oh, for the love of God,

13:31.300 --> 13:34.100
give me that.
Vanessa, honey?

13:34.200 --> 13:36.900
Hi, Bonnie Wheeler--
Ben and Danny's mom.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.200
Real quick-- Tucker is
breaking up with you.

13:38.300 --> 13:39.300
- Bye-bye.
- {Y:i}( Phone beeps )

13:41.200 --> 13:42.300
Done.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.900
What did you ju--

13:48.000 --> 13:49.200
Oh my God,
I can't believe you ju--

13:51.300 --> 13:53.200
- You did it.
- ( Mouths )

13:54.300 --> 13:56.000
I'm free.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.300
That was amazing!

13:59.300 --> 14:01.100
- I know.
- ( Laughs )

14:01.100 --> 14:03.100
And who said
having you around

14:03.100 --> 14:06.200
was a {Y:i}bad idea?
( Laughs )

14:06.200 --> 14:08.200
Oh, man.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.900
I don't know, Tucker.

14:10.900 --> 14:12.200
Who did?

14:13.800 --> 14:16.800
You know, track isn't
a real sport, right?

14:18.200 --> 14:21.000
Well, I've got a wall full of
ribbons that beg to differ.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.900
Ribbons.
Do you keep them

14:22.900 --> 14:25.000
next to your headbands
and scrunchies?

14:27.100 --> 14:28.900
d Danny,
stop talking. d

14:31.000 --> 14:33.100
I wish there was a way to find
out if she's still there.

14:33.100 --> 14:35.300
There is--
go home.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.100
No, that sounds
a little risky.

14:39.300 --> 14:42.000
All right. Let me put this
for you another way--

14:42.000 --> 14:45.100
get out of my apartment
and go talk to your mom.

14:46.100 --> 14:48.100
You know, what, um.

14:48.200 --> 14:51.100
- I should probably go.
- You don't even know our mom.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.900
You know what, Jack?
That is a good idea. You should go.

14:55.900 --> 14:58.800
Ouch. Don't know how much
clearer that could be.

14:58.800 --> 15:00.200
Sorry it didn't work out
between you two.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.100
I meant
I'm going with him.

15:02.100 --> 15:04.100
So, uh, just lock the door

15:04.100 --> 15:05.300
when you leave.
All right? Bye.

15:09.800 --> 15:10.900
He seemed nice.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.900
I can't believe that's all I had to do.
( Laughing )

15:14.900 --> 15:16.800
"Hey-yo, Vanessa.
It's over." Click.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.200
"Don't call me
'cause I so won't

15:19.300 --> 15:21.200
"be calling you." Click.

15:21.200 --> 15:23.000
Did they really say

15:23.000 --> 15:24.200
that they don't
want me around?

15:24.300 --> 15:25.900
Who cares
what they said?

15:25.900 --> 15:27.100
In my book
you are awesome.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.200
- {Y:i}( Knocks on door )
{Y:i}- Oh, it's Vanessa!

15:29.300 --> 15:31.100
What have you
done, woman!

15:31.200 --> 15:33.100
Look, I'm not here.

15:39.900 --> 15:41.900
- Hey.
- Oh.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.200
Hi, Riley.
Officer.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.300
Your sons and Emma

15:46.300 --> 15:48.200
are in my apartment
hiding out.

15:48.200 --> 15:49.900
So maybe you can
settle this

15:49.900 --> 15:51.200
so I can have
my place back?

15:51.200 --> 15:53.200
They're hiding out?

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
From me?

15:56.200 --> 15:58.900
Oh. Well, I think

15:58.900 --> 16:00.200
they're about
to be found.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.200
( Elevator dings )

16:07.200 --> 16:09.800
Care for a retrial,
counselor?

16:09.800 --> 16:11.000
Permission to
approach the bench.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.500
Mom, please. I can explain.

16:18.500 --> 16:20.700
All right, go ahead.
No? Didn't think so.

16:28.700 --> 16:31.900
Are you just giving keys to everyone now?
What are you doing?

16:31.900 --> 16:34.500
Just trying out
the worst date ever.

16:34.600 --> 16:35.700
Oh, look,
it's working.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.800
Where were you guys?

16:38.800 --> 16:41.700
Tucker? How long
have you been there?

16:41.700 --> 16:43.600
Long enough.
( Chuckles )

16:43.700 --> 16:44.900
I'll put Emma to bed,

16:44.900 --> 16:46.600
and then you can
all return

16:46.600 --> 16:48.000
to your regularly
scheduled depravity.

16:48.100 --> 16:49.700
I can put her down.

16:49.700 --> 16:51.700
Oh. Oh, right.

16:51.700 --> 16:53.600
Don't need grandma's
help any more.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.800
- I get it.
- No, Mom. That's not what I'm saying.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.700
Then what are
you saying?

16:57.800 --> 17:00.900
Ben, just tell
your mom how you feel.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.599
Danny?

17:08.000 --> 17:09.599
Tucker?

17:10.900 --> 17:12.700
Oh, we're actually cool.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.700
Okay, well,
this is going nowhere,

17:15.800 --> 17:16.900
so, uh, let's try
something different.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
All right,
gather around.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.700
Okay. Well, this is
something we just learned

17:24.700 --> 17:26.900
in our mediation class
for settling disputes.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
I just need to find something
to use as a truth totem.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
We didn't learn that
in mediation.

17:31.500 --> 17:33.700
Okay, so I learned it
at fat camp.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.900
- Fat camp?
- Told you.

17:35.900 --> 17:37.800
All right.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.900
This will be
our truth rattle.

17:39.900 --> 17:41.800
- ( Rattles )
- Or not.

17:41.800 --> 17:43.500
All right.
Um, so whoever's holding

17:43.600 --> 17:46.600
the truth baby has
to tell the truth.

17:46.700 --> 17:48.000
And since Ben
is conveniently

17:48.100 --> 17:50.900
holding our totem,
Ben?

17:50.900 --> 17:53.600
Oh, for crying out loud,
just spit it out.

17:53.700 --> 17:54.900
You can tell me
anything.

17:54.900 --> 17:56.600
You're overbearing
and rude,

17:56.600 --> 17:58.700
and I want my key
and my baby back.

18:03.700 --> 18:05.900
{Y:i}( Door opens, slams )

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Wow.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.600
No one was ever that
truthful at fat camp.

18:14.700 --> 18:16.600
- {Y:i}( Elevator dings )
{Y:i}- Mom, wait!

18:17.600 --> 18:18.600
- Ow.
- Good.

18:18.700 --> 18:19.800
( Dings )

18:23.600 --> 18:24.800
What? First
you throw me out,

18:24.900 --> 18:26.900
and now you lock me in?
Make up your mind, Ben.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.800
Mom, please.

18:29.800 --> 18:31.600
Look, I know
I should have

18:31.600 --> 18:32.800
just told you the truth
from the beginning.

18:32.900 --> 18:34.600
That you don't
want me around?

18:34.600 --> 18:36.600
No, you don't understand.

18:36.700 --> 18:37.900
{Y:i}We just need
{Y:i}some space.

18:37.900 --> 18:40.000
We have our guy stuff
that we like to do.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.800
Like sit around in your
underwear playing videogames

18:42.900 --> 18:45.500
while strange women
flounce in and out?

18:45.600 --> 18:47.000
So you do understand.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.800
I'm annoyed because
everyone keeps forgetting

18:51.800 --> 18:54.000
that this is
my apartment.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
And would it
kill you to refill

18:57.000 --> 18:59.800
- an ice cube tray?
- That all you got?

18:59.900 --> 19:01.900
My big list is
in the other room.

19:03.500 --> 19:04.700
Okay.
All right.

19:04.800 --> 19:06.700
Come here.

19:06.800 --> 19:09.500
Truth--
my friends are idiots

19:09.500 --> 19:10.800
and I really wish

19:10.900 --> 19:12.600
we could start
tonight over.

19:13.800 --> 19:15.700
Not idiots,

19:15.700 --> 19:17.600
just suspicious.

19:17.700 --> 19:18.900
I truly don't
trust this guy.

19:20.700 --> 19:22.800
Danny's right.
I lied.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.700
{Y:i}I didn't really
{Y:i}need tutoring.

19:25.200 --> 19:27.500
I just wanted to get
to know you better.

19:28.900 --> 19:29.900
I kind of knew that.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.700
Wait. He wasn't
holding the baby.

19:35.800 --> 19:38.500
Mom, you know I couldn't
do this without you,

19:38.500 --> 19:41.500
but {Y:i}I need to be
the one raising Emma.

19:41.500 --> 19:43.600
I need help,
not a replacement.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.600
Is that what
you think?

19:47.800 --> 19:50.500
I never meant
to replace you.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.700
I just came
to the city every day

19:52.700 --> 19:53.900
and spent
every moment with Emma

19:54.000 --> 19:54.900
and did all
the things with her

19:55.000 --> 19:56.700
that you probably
wanted to do with her.

20:00.600 --> 20:01.800
Basically
replacing you.

20:03.700 --> 20:06.000
Yeah, that's what
I was doing.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
Oh, Ben,
I'm so sorry.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.500
It's okay.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.000
We just need to set
some boundaries.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.700
It was like in high school
when you had to learn

20:14.800 --> 20:16.500
to knock before you came
into my room.

20:16.600 --> 20:17.700
Well, you only gotta
walk in on that

20:17.700 --> 20:19.600
10 or 12 times before
you learn your lesson.

20:19.700 --> 20:21.600
( Shudders )

20:21.700 --> 20:24.700
I guess I should
give you this back.

20:26.600 --> 20:27.900
You already made
a copy, didn't you?

20:28.000 --> 20:29.800
Oh, my baby
knows me so well.

20:29.800 --> 20:30.800
( Chuckles )

20:32.900 --> 20:33.900
( Elevator dings )

20:36.900 --> 20:38.700
Really, Riley?

20:38.700 --> 20:40.700
Get a room.

20:40.700 --> 20:42.700
Believe me,
we are trying.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Finger tracks
in the peanut butter.

20:48.300 --> 20:50.100
Toenails
on the floor.

20:51.100 --> 20:52.000
Two words--

20:52.000 --> 20:53.100
Hairy soap.

20:53.100 --> 20:55.100
Okay.

20:56.500 --> 20:59.400
- Can we be done?
- Oh yeah, sure. We can be done--

20:59.500 --> 21:01.700
if you want to start
talking about Riley.

21:01.700 --> 21:04.000
- Continue.
- Exactly. Okay.

21:04.100 --> 21:05.300
Using towels
as bathmats,

21:05.300 --> 21:07.300
using bathmats
as towels,

21:07.300 --> 21:09.900
taking any of my shampoos,
conditioners,

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
ointments, lotions,
powders or pomades.

21:12.100 --> 21:14.300
Okay? Muddy shoes.
Sweaty gym bags.

21:14.300 --> 21:17.000
And never having
your own gum.

21:18.200 --> 21:20.300
- Is that it?
- What do you think? No.

21:20.400 --> 21:24.300
