01:21.047 --> 01:22.947
Shit!

01:46.105 --> 01:47.470
Andrew, hey.

01:50.443 --> 01:51.967
Here you go.
Your regular lattes.

01:52.011 --> 01:56.209
Literally saved my life.
Thank you. Thank you.

02:10.863 --> 02:11.921
- Everyone OK?
- Yeah.

02:11.964 --> 02:14.228
- Yeah.
- Me too.

02:15.668 --> 02:18.967
Hello, Frank? How's my favorite writer?

02:19.005 --> 02:20.666
Of course you've been
thinking about our talk

02:20.706 --> 02:22.367
because you know I'm right.

02:22.408 --> 02:24.308
Frank, people in this
country are busy, broke,

02:24.343 --> 02:26.436
and they hate to read.
They need someone they can trust to say,

02:26.479 --> 02:28.811
"Hey! Don't watch
<i>CSl: Indianapolis</i> tonight.

02:28.848 --> 02:32.249
Read a book! Read Frank's book."
And that person is Oprah.

02:37.590 --> 02:39.319
- Cuttin' it close.
- One of those mornings.

02:39.358 --> 02:40.848
Thank you, Captain Obvious.

02:40.893 --> 02:43.157
Sweet...

02:43.196 --> 02:44.857
- Uh, sorry.
...Jesus!

02:44.897 --> 02:46.797
Rub some dirt on it, brother.

02:46.833 --> 02:50.291
Frank, the truth is all
A-plus novelists do publicity.

02:51.237 --> 02:54.035
Roth, McCourt, Russo, and...

02:54.073 --> 02:56.974
Frank! Can I tell you what else
they have in common? A Pulitzer.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.611
I need the shirt off
your back. Literally.

02:59.645 --> 03:03.103
- You're kidding, right?
- Yankees, Boston, this Tuesday,

03:03.149 --> 03:05.549
two company seats for your shirt.
You have five seconds to decide.

03:05.585 --> 03:07.246
Five, four, three, two, one.

03:07.286 --> 03:08.776
I know...

03:08.821 --> 03:11.085
- Shh!
- Later.

03:16.329 --> 03:18.160
Uh-oh.

03:26.005 --> 03:28.030
Uh, hello. Hello?

03:34.747 --> 03:36.647
Morning, boss. You have a
conference call in 30 minutes.

03:36.682 --> 03:38.650
Yes. About the marketing
of the spring books. I know.

03:38.684 --> 03:40.049
Staff meeting at 9:00.

03:40.086 --> 03:41.644
Did you call, um...
What's her name?

03:41.687 --> 03:44.121
The one with the ugly hands.

03:44.156 --> 03:45.180
- Janet.
- Yes, Janet.

03:45.224 --> 03:46.623
Yes. I did call her. I told her that

03:46.659 --> 03:48.354
if she doesn't get her
manuscript in on time

03:48.394 --> 03:50.794
you won't give her a release date.
Your immigration lawyer called.

03:50.830 --> 03:51.956
He said it's imperative...

03:51.998 --> 03:53.659
Cancel the call, push
the meeting to tomorrow

03:53.699 --> 03:55.132
and keep the lawyer on the sheets.

03:55.167 --> 03:56.634
Oh, and get a hold of PR,

03:56.669 --> 03:58.102
have them start drafting
a press release.

03:58.137 --> 03:59.604
Frank is doing <i>Oprah.</i>

03:59.639 --> 04:02.164
Wow. Nicely done.

04:02.208 --> 04:05.405
If I want your praise,
I will ask for it.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.414
Um...

04:09.448 --> 04:11.109
Who is, uh, who is Jillian?

04:11.150 --> 04:13.846
And why does she want me to call her?

04:17.055 --> 04:18.990
Well, that was originally my cup.

04:19.024 --> 04:20.993
And I'm drinking your coffee why?

04:21.027 --> 04:23.052
Because your coffee spilled.

04:28.734 --> 04:32.568
So, you drink unsweetened
cinnamon light soy lattes?

04:32.605 --> 04:35.665
I do. It's like Christmas in a cup.

04:35.708 --> 04:37.141
Is that a coincidence?

04:37.176 --> 04:39.576
Incredibly, it is.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.773
I mean I wouldn't possibly drink
the same coffee that you drink

04:41.814 --> 04:43.441
just in case yours spilled.

04:43.482 --> 04:45.279
That would be pathetic.

04:45.318 --> 04:47.343
Morning. Miss Tate's office.

04:47.386 --> 04:48.683
Hey, Bob.

04:50.356 --> 04:53.587
Actually, we're headed to
your office right now. Yeah.

04:53.626 --> 04:56.390
Why are we headed to Bob's office?

05:07.840 --> 05:08.898
Oop!

05:12.311 --> 05:13.903
Have you finished the
manuscript I gave you?

05:13.946 --> 05:16.506
Uh, I read a few pages.
I wasn't that impressed.

05:16.549 --> 05:17.914
- Can I say something?
- No.

05:17.950 --> 05:20.009
I've read thousands of manuscripts,

05:20.052 --> 05:21.451
and this is the only one
I've given you.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.216
There's an incredible novel in there.

05:23.255 --> 05:25.155
The kind of novel you used to publish.

05:25.191 --> 05:28.490
Uh, wrong. And I do think you
order the same coffee as I do

05:28.527 --> 05:31.018
just in case you spill,
which is, in fact, pathetic.

05:31.063 --> 05:32.325
- Or impressive.
- I'd be impressed

05:32.365 --> 05:33.593
if you didn't spill in the first place.

05:33.633 --> 05:35.066
Now remember, you're
just a prop in here.

05:35.101 --> 05:37.069
Won't say a word.

05:39.538 --> 05:44.475
Ah! Our fearless leader and
her liege. Please, do come in.

05:44.510 --> 05:48.139
Oh. Beautiful breakfront. Is it new?

05:48.180 --> 05:51.206
It is English Regency Egyptian
Revival, built in the 1800s

05:51.250 --> 05:54.083
but, yes, it is new to my office.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.747
Witty.

05:55.788 --> 05:58.416
Bob, I'm letting you go.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.052
Pardon?

06:03.095 --> 06:06.189
I asked you over a dozen times to get
Frank to do <i>Oprah,</i> and you didn't do it.

06:06.232 --> 06:08.325
You're fired.

06:10.202 --> 06:11.897
I have told you that is impossible.

06:11.937 --> 06:14.337
Frank hasn't done an
interview in 20 years.

06:14.373 --> 06:16.068
Well that is
interesting, because I just

06:16.108 --> 06:18.599
got off the phone
with him, and he is in.

06:19.879 --> 06:21.278
Excuse me?

06:21.313 --> 06:22.712
You didn't even call him, did you?

06:24.116 --> 06:25.845
- But...
- I know, I know.

06:25.885 --> 06:29.116
Frank can be a little scary
to deal with. For you.

06:29.155 --> 06:32.386
Now, I will give you two
months to find another job.

06:32.425 --> 06:34.893
And then you can tell
everyone you resigned, OK?

06:38.964 --> 06:41.057
What's his twenty?

06:41.100 --> 06:44.763
He's moving. He has crazy eyes.

06:44.804 --> 06:46.897
Don't do it, Bob. Don't do it.

06:46.939 --> 06:50.932
You poisonous bitch!

06:50.976 --> 06:52.637
You can't fire me!

06:52.678 --> 06:54.976
You don't think I see
what you're doing here?

06:55.014 --> 06:56.777
Sandbagging me on this Oprah thing

06:56.816 --> 06:58.716
just so that you can
look good to the board?

06:58.751 --> 07:01.743
Because you are threatened by me!

07:01.787 --> 07:04.654
- And you are a monster.
- Bob, stop.

07:04.690 --> 07:07.989
Just because you have
no semblance of a life

07:08.027 --> 07:09.790
outside of this office,

07:09.829 --> 07:11.956
you think that you can treat all of us

07:11.997 --> 07:13.658
like your own personal slaves.

07:13.699 --> 07:16.259
You know what? I feel sorry for you.

07:16.302 --> 07:19.032
Because you know what you're
gonna have on your deathbed?

07:19.071 --> 07:21.096
Nothing and no one.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.503
Listen carefully, Bob.

07:27.546 --> 07:31.141
I didn't fire you because
I feel threatened. No.

07:31.183 --> 07:34.584
I fired you because you're
lazy, entitled, incompetent

07:34.620 --> 07:36.281
and you spend more time
cheating on your wife

07:36.322 --> 07:37.653
than you do in your office.

07:37.690 --> 07:39.021
And if you say another word,

07:39.058 --> 07:41.356
Andrew here is gonna have you
thrown out on your ass, OK?

07:41.393 --> 07:43.918
Another word and you're
going out of here

07:43.963 --> 07:45.225
with an armed escort.

07:45.264 --> 07:47.129
Andrew will film it with
his little camera phone

07:47.166 --> 07:48.793
and he will put it
on that Internet site.

07:48.834 --> 07:50.062
- What was it?
- YouTube?

07:50.102 --> 07:52.536
Exactly. Is that what you want?

07:52.571 --> 07:54.198
Didn't think so. I have work to do.

07:56.542 --> 07:58.567
Have security take his
breakfront out of his office

07:58.611 --> 07:59.737
and put it in my conference room.

07:59.779 --> 08:00.803
Will do.

08:00.846 --> 08:01.938
And I need you around this weekend

08:01.981 --> 08:03.346
to help review his files
and his manuscript.

08:03.382 --> 08:05.976
- This weekend?
- You have a problem with that?

08:06.018 --> 08:08.043
No. I... just my
grandmother's 90th birthday,

08:08.087 --> 08:09.486
so I was gonna go home and...

08:09.522 --> 08:11.319
...it's fine. I'll cancel it.

08:11.357 --> 08:13.291
You're actually saving me from
a weekend of misery anyway,

08:13.325 --> 08:15.623
so it's... good talk, yeah.

08:15.661 --> 08:20.758
I know, I know. OK, tell
Gammy I'm sorry. OK? What...

08:20.800 --> 08:22.358
Mom. What do you want me to tell you?

08:22.401 --> 08:24.835
She's making me work the weekend.

08:24.870 --> 08:26.167
No, I'm not... no.

08:26.205 --> 08:27.763
Listen, I've worked too
hard for this promotion

08:27.807 --> 08:28.899
to throw it all away, OK?

08:28.941 --> 08:30.431
I'm sure that Dad is pissed,

08:30.476 --> 08:33.376
but we take all of our submissions
around here very seriously.

08:33.412 --> 08:36.813
We'll get back to
you as soon as we can.

08:36.849 --> 08:38.840
- Was that your family?
- Yes.

08:38.884 --> 08:40.613
- They tell you to quit?
- Every single day.

08:40.653 --> 08:43.850
Miss Tate's office.

08:43.889 --> 08:46.585
Oh... Yeah. OK. All right.

08:46.625 --> 08:48.718
Bergen and Malloy want to
see you upstairs immediately.

08:48.761 --> 08:51.355
OK. Come get me in ten
minutes. We've got a lot to do.

08:51.397 --> 08:52.421
Okey-doke.

08:58.070 --> 08:59.765
Good morning, Miss Tate.

09:01.974 --> 09:03.999
Jack, Edwin.

09:04.043 --> 09:05.806
Margaret, congratulations
on the <i>Oprah</i> thing.

09:05.845 --> 09:07.710
- That's terrific news.
- Thank you, thank you.

09:07.746 --> 09:10.613
This isn't about my second raise, is it?
Just kidding.

09:10.649 --> 09:14.278
Margaret, do you
remember when we agreed

09:14.320 --> 09:16.345
that you wouldn't go to
the Frankfurt Book Fair

09:16.388 --> 09:17.787
because you weren't allowed
out of the country

09:17.823 --> 09:19.723
while your visa application
was being processed?

09:19.758 --> 09:20.782
Yes. I do.

09:20.826 --> 09:23.192
And... you went to Frankfurt.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.424
Yes, I did. We were going
to lose DeLillo to Viking.

09:25.464 --> 09:27.489
So... really didn't
have a choice, did I?

09:27.533 --> 09:28.898
It seems that the
United States Government

09:28.934 --> 09:30.959
doesn't care much who
publishes Don DeLillo.

09:31.003 --> 09:33.767
We, uh, just spoke to
your immigration attorney.

09:33.806 --> 09:36.434
Great. So, we're all good?
Everything good?

09:36.475 --> 09:38.943
Margaret, your visa application
has been denied.

09:38.978 --> 09:42.141
And you are being deported.

09:42.181 --> 09:43.307
Deported?

09:43.349 --> 09:45.044
And apparently there
was also some paperwork

09:45.084 --> 09:46.449
that you didn't fill out in time.

09:46.485 --> 09:50.945
Come on. Come on! It's not
like I'm even an immigrant!

09:50.990 --> 09:52.981
I'm from Canada, for Christ's sake.

09:53.025 --> 09:55.391
There's gotta be... there's
gotta be something we can do.

09:55.427 --> 09:57.395
We can reapply, but unfortunately

09:57.429 --> 10:00.421
you have to leave the country
for at least a year.

10:02.468 --> 10:07.371
OK. OK, well, that's
not ideal, but, uh...,

10:07.406 --> 10:09.203
I can, uh... I can manage
everything from Toronto...

10:09.241 --> 10:10.401
No, Margaret.

10:10.442 --> 10:11.739
...with videoconferencing
and Internet.

10:11.777 --> 10:12.903
Unfortunately, Margaret,

10:12.945 --> 10:15.641
if you're deported,
you can't work for an American company.

10:15.681 --> 10:18.081
Until this is resolved I'm going
to turn operations over

10:18.117 --> 10:19.311
to Bob Spaulding.

10:19.351 --> 10:22.013
Bob Spaulding? The guy I just fired?

10:22.054 --> 10:23.453
We need an editor in chief.

10:23.489 --> 10:25.855
He is the only person in the building
who has enough experience.

10:25.891 --> 10:27.722
- You cannot be serious. I beg of you.
- Margaret.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.728
We are desperate to have you stay.

10:29.762 --> 10:32.731
If there was any way, any way at all

10:32.765 --> 10:34.323
that we could make this work,
we'd be doing it.

10:34.366 --> 10:35.492
There is no way...

10:35.534 --> 10:36.558
I am begging you.

10:36.602 --> 10:38.229
No, Margaret. Excuse me,
we're in a meeting.

10:38.270 --> 10:39.828
- Sorry to interrupt.
- What? What!

10:39.872 --> 10:42.432
Mary from Miss Winfrey's office
called. She's on the line.

10:42.474 --> 10:43.532
- I know.
- She's on hold.

10:43.575 --> 10:46.510
She needs to speak with you right away.
I told her you were otherwise engaged.

10:46.545 --> 10:49.105
She insisted, so... sorry.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.775
So...

11:00.759 --> 11:02.784
Uh...

11:03.963 --> 11:05.430
Come here.

11:07.866 --> 11:11.632
Uh... Gentlemen, I understand.
I understand...

11:11.670 --> 11:14.764
the predicament that we are in.

11:14.807 --> 11:16.468
And, um...

11:17.810 --> 11:20.574
And there's, uh... well...

11:20.612 --> 11:23.240
I think there's something
that you should know.

11:24.583 --> 11:27.984
Uh... we're, uh...
we're getting married.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.113
We are getting married.

11:30.155 --> 11:31.782
- Who is getting married?
- You and I.

11:31.824 --> 11:34.588
You and I are getting married! Yes.

11:34.626 --> 11:36.287
- We are.
- Getting married.

11:36.328 --> 11:37.761
- We are getting married.
- Yes.

11:39.531 --> 11:41.624
Isn't he your secretary?

11:41.667 --> 11:42.725
Assistant.

11:42.768 --> 11:46.499
Executive, uh...
assistant secretary. Titles.

11:46.538 --> 11:50.804
But, wouldn't be the first time
one of us fell for our secretaries.

11:50.843 --> 11:52.834
Would it, Edwin?

11:52.878 --> 11:55.108
With Laquisha. Remember?

11:55.147 --> 11:58.674
So, yeah... The truth is,

11:58.717 --> 12:02.847
you know, Andrew and I, we're...
we are just two people

12:02.888 --> 12:05.049
who weren't meant to
fall in love but we did.

12:05.090 --> 12:06.421
No.

12:06.458 --> 12:11.486
All those late nights at the
office and weekend book fairs.

12:11.530 --> 12:12.588
- Yeah...
- No.

12:12.631 --> 12:15.293
- Something happened.
- Something.

12:15.334 --> 12:18.462
Yeah. Tried to fight it and...

12:18.504 --> 12:20.131
Can't, can't fight a...

12:20.172 --> 12:24.632
Can't fight a love like ours, so, uh...

12:24.676 --> 12:28.077
Uh... Are we good with this?
Are you happy?

12:28.113 --> 12:31.981
Because, well... we are happy. So happy.

12:32.017 --> 12:33.143
- Margaret.
- Yes?

12:33.185 --> 12:35.085
It's terrific.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.849
Just make it legal. Mmm?

12:36.889 --> 12:39.517
Oh! Legal.

12:39.558 --> 12:42.891
Yeah, well, then...
then that means we...

12:42.928 --> 12:45.226
...we need to get ourselves
to the immigration office.

12:45.264 --> 12:47.892
So we can work this
whole mess out. Right?

12:47.933 --> 12:49.798
Thank you
very much, gentlemen.

12:49.835 --> 12:50.893
We will do that right away.

12:50.936 --> 12:53.131
Thank you very much,
gentlemen. Thank you.

12:53.172 --> 12:55.402
- Gentlemen.
- Thank you.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.078
Margaret
and Andrew are getting married!

13:00.112 --> 13:01.409
What is that about?

13:01.447 --> 13:03.506
Dragon Lady!
Here they come...

13:03.549 --> 13:04.880
Yeah.

13:04.917 --> 13:06.680
What is he thinking?

13:06.718 --> 13:07.810
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

13:09.922 --> 13:12.516
Dude, for real. Her?

13:12.558 --> 13:14.822
Married? Didn't
even know they were dating...

13:36.782 --> 13:37.806
What?

13:39.184 --> 13:41.084
I don't understand what's happening.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.088
Relax. This is for you, too.

13:43.122 --> 13:44.453
Do explain.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.720
They were going to make Bob chief.

13:46.758 --> 13:48.419
So naturally I would have to marry you.

13:48.460 --> 13:50.052
And what's the problem?

13:50.095 --> 13:52.427
Like you were saving yourself
for someone special?

13:52.464 --> 13:55.592
I like to think so.
Besides, it's illegal.

13:55.634 --> 13:58.831
They're looking for terrorists,
not for book publishers.

13:58.871 --> 14:00.395
- Margaret.
- Yes?

14:00.439 --> 14:03.499
- I'm not gonna marry you.
- Sure you are.

14:03.542 --> 14:06.568
Because if you don't marry me, your
dreams of touching the lives of millions

14:06.612 --> 14:08.341
with the written word are dead.

14:14.286 --> 14:16.811
Bob is gonna fire you the second
I'm gone. Guaranteed.

14:16.855 --> 14:18.914
That means you're out on the street
alone looking for a job.

14:18.957 --> 14:21.448
That means all the time that
we spent together, all the lattes,

14:21.493 --> 14:23.688
all the canceled dates,
all the midnight Tampax runs,

14:23.729 --> 14:27.028
were all for nothing and all your dreams
of being an editor are gone.

14:27.065 --> 14:29.465
But don't worry, after the required
allotment of time,

14:29.501 --> 14:30.968
we'll get a quickie divorce
and you'll be done with me.

14:31.003 --> 14:32.834
But until then, like it or not,

14:32.871 --> 14:34.805
your wagon is hitched to mine. OK?

14:34.840 --> 14:37.035
Phone.

14:51.290 --> 14:52.951
- This way.
- Margaret.

14:52.991 --> 14:55.016
- Come.
- The line...

14:55.060 --> 14:56.084
Next, please.

14:56.128 --> 14:57.755
Ooh, ooh. Just, uh...

14:57.796 --> 14:59.320
Sorry, I just need to ask him something.

14:59.364 --> 15:02.162
I need for you to file this
fiancée visa for me, please.

15:06.805 --> 15:09.205
- Miss Tate?
- Yes.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.300
Please, come with me.

15:11.343 --> 15:13.903
Yes, ma'am, I understand
that. We're backed up...

15:15.080 --> 15:17.310
I have a bad feeling about this.

15:20.986 --> 15:22.351
- Hi. Hello.
- Hello.

15:22.387 --> 15:24.878
Hi. I'm Mr. Gilbertson.

15:24.923 --> 15:26.982
- Ah!
- And you must be Andrew,

15:27.025 --> 15:28.356
- and you must be...
- Margaret.

15:28.393 --> 15:30.190
...Margaret. Sorry about the wait.

15:30.229 --> 15:31.890
It's a, uh, crazy day today.

15:31.930 --> 15:34.091
Oh, of course, of course. We understand.

15:34.132 --> 15:36.157
And I can't tell you how much
we appreciate you seeing us

15:36.201 --> 15:40.262
- on such short notice.
- OK.

15:40.305 --> 15:42.796
<i># Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh</i>
<i>buh, buh, buh, buuuh</i>

15:42.841 --> 15:44.672
So, I have one question for you.

15:44.710 --> 15:47.907
Are you both committing fraud
to avoid her deportation

15:47.946 --> 15:52.042
so she can keep her position
as editor in chief at Colden Books?

15:53.619 --> 15:55.712
- That's ridiculous.
- Where did you hear that?

15:55.754 --> 15:58.052
We had a phone tip this afternoon
from a man named...

15:58.090 --> 15:59.853
Would it be Bob Spaulding?

15:59.891 --> 16:01.222
Bob Spaulding.

16:01.260 --> 16:04.559
Bob. Poor Bob. I am so sorry.

16:04.596 --> 16:08.532
Bob is nothing but a disgruntled
former employee.

16:08.567 --> 16:09.659
And I apologize.

16:09.701 --> 16:12.397
But we know you're incredibly busy

16:12.437 --> 16:16.305
with a room full of gardeners
and delivery boys to tend to.

16:16.341 --> 16:17.899
If you just give us our next step,

16:17.943 --> 16:19.968
we will be out of your
hair and on our way.

16:21.079 --> 16:22.637
Miss Tate, please.

16:24.049 --> 16:28.179
Let me explain to you the
process that's about to unfold.

16:28.220 --> 16:31.621
Step one will be a scheduled interview.

16:31.657 --> 16:35.184
I'll put you each in a room,
and I'll ask you every little question

16:35.227 --> 16:37.195
that a real couple
would know about each other.

16:37.229 --> 16:41.427
Step two, I dig deeper.
I look at your phone records,

16:41.466 --> 16:43.798
I talk to your neighbors,
I interview your coworkers.

16:43.835 --> 16:46.269
If your answers don't match up
at every point,

16:46.305 --> 16:48.967
you will be deported indefinitely.

16:49.007 --> 16:51.407
And you, young man,
will have committed a felony...

16:51.443 --> 16:55.436
...punishable by a fine of $250,000

16:55.480 --> 16:59.712
and a stay of five years
in federal prison.

17:02.821 --> 17:06.051
So, Andrew.

17:06.090 --> 17:09.492
You wanna... you want to talk to me?

17:13.332 --> 17:15.128
No?

17:17.669 --> 17:19.102
Yes?

17:23.208 --> 17:25.073
The truth is...

17:28.146 --> 17:32.913
Mr. Gilbertson, the truth is...

17:32.951 --> 17:34.714
Margaret and I...

17:37.489 --> 17:39.457
...are just two people

17:39.491 --> 17:42.483
who weren't supposed to fall in love.

17:43.362 --> 17:45.057
But did.

17:46.865 --> 17:49.095
We couldn't tell anyone we work with

17:49.134 --> 17:51.728
because of my big promotion
that I had coming up.

17:51.770 --> 17:53.237
- Promotion?
- Yeah.

17:53.271 --> 17:57.105
- Your?
- We... we both felt, uh...

17:57.142 --> 18:01.272
...that it would be deeply inappropriate
if I were to be promoted to editor.

18:01.313 --> 18:03.975
- Editor. Mmm-hmm.
...while we were...

18:05.484 --> 18:08.044
So...

18:08.086 --> 18:11.146
Have the two of you told your parents
about your secret love?

18:11.189 --> 18:14.522
Oh, I... impossible.
My parents are dead.

18:14.559 --> 18:16.823
- No brothers or sisters either.
- Gone.

18:16.862 --> 18:19.160
Are your parents dead?

18:19.197 --> 18:21.358
- Oh, no, his are very much alive.
- No... very much.

18:21.400 --> 18:24.699
Very much. They're, ah... Well,
we were gonna tell them this weekend.

18:24.736 --> 18:28.695
Gammy's 90th birthday, and the whole
family's coming together.

18:28.740 --> 18:30.332
And we thought it'd be a nice surprise.

18:30.375 --> 18:32.400
And where is this
surprise gonna take place?

18:32.444 --> 18:34.537
At Andrew's parents' house.

18:34.579 --> 18:35.705
Where is that located again?

18:35.747 --> 18:38.375
Um...
Why am I doing all the talking?

18:38.417 --> 18:39.782
It's your parents' house.

18:39.818 --> 18:41.251
Why don't you tell him
where it is. Jump in.

18:42.687 --> 18:45.417
- Sitka.
- Sitka.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.482
- Alaska.
- Alaska?

18:47.526 --> 18:49.619
You're gonna go to Alaska this weekend?

18:51.163 --> 18:53.131
- Yeah.
- Yes, yes.

18:53.165 --> 18:56.362
We are going to Alaska.
Alaska, that's where...

18:56.401 --> 18:59.302
That's where my little...
that's where my Andrew's from.

19:00.839 --> 19:02.170
OK.

19:02.207 --> 19:05.665
Fine. I see how this is gonna go.

19:05.710 --> 19:08.645
I will see you both
at 11:00 Monday morning

19:08.680 --> 19:10.648
for your scheduled interview,

19:10.682 --> 19:14.083
and your answers better
match up on every account.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.685
- Thank you.
- Hello?

19:16.721 --> 19:18.814
- I'm looking forward to this one.
- We're looking forward to this one.

19:18.857 --> 19:19.915
Thank you.

19:19.958 --> 19:22.722
Gonna be fun.
I'll be checking up on you.

19:22.761 --> 19:23.785
You got it.

19:28.900 --> 19:33.200
OK... so, what's gonna happen is
we will go up there.

19:33.238 --> 19:35.263
We will pretend like we're
boyfriend and girlfriend,

19:35.307 --> 19:36.899
tell your parents we're engaged.

19:36.942 --> 19:38.534
Uh, use the miles for the tickets.

19:38.577 --> 19:42.274
I guess I will pop for you to fly first
class. But make sure you use the miles.

19:42.314 --> 19:43.645
If we don't get the miles,
we're not doing it.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.616
Oh, and please confirm
the vegan meal, OK?

19:45.650 --> 19:47.618
'Cause last time they actually
gave it to a vegan,

19:47.652 --> 19:49.279
and they, uh... forced me to eat

19:49.321 --> 19:51.812
this clammy, warm, creamy
salad thing, which was...

19:51.857 --> 19:53.848
Hey, I'm... Why aren't you taking notes?

19:53.892 --> 19:56.224
I'm sorry, were you not in that room?

19:56.261 --> 19:57.626
What? What?

19:58.997 --> 20:01.488
Oh! The thing you said about
being promoted?

20:01.533 --> 20:03.524
Genius! Genius.
He completely fell for it.

20:03.568 --> 20:04.830
I was serious.

20:04.870 --> 20:07.771
I'm looking at a $250,000 fine
and five years in jail.

20:07.806 --> 20:09.000
That changes things.

20:09.040 --> 20:13.170
- Promote you to editor? No, no way.
- Then I quit, and you're screwed.

20:13.211 --> 20:14.235
Bye-bye, Margaret.

20:14.279 --> 20:15.746
- Andrew!
- It really has been

20:15.780 --> 20:19.181
- a little slice of heaven.
- Andrew, Andrew! Fine, fine.

20:20.519 --> 20:22.453
I'll make you editor. Fine.

20:22.487 --> 20:26.082
If you do the Alaska weekend
and the immigration interview,

20:26.124 --> 20:29.025
I will make you editor. Happy?

20:29.060 --> 20:31.460
- And not in two years. Right away.
- Fine.

20:31.496 --> 20:32.986
And you'll publish my manuscript.

20:34.833 --> 20:36.198
Ten thousand copy first...

20:36.234 --> 20:37.792
Twenty thousand copies, first run.

20:37.836 --> 20:39.770
And we'll tell my family
about our engagement

20:39.804 --> 20:41.431
when I want and how I want.

20:41.473 --> 20:43.771
Now, ask me nicely.

20:43.808 --> 20:44.968
"Ask you nicely" what?

20:45.010 --> 20:48.776
Ask me nicely to marry you, Margaret.

20:50.815 --> 20:53.841
- What does that mean?
- You heard me. On your knee.

21:02.994 --> 21:04.018
Fine.

21:12.437 --> 21:14.769
- Does this work for you?
- Oh, I like this. Yeah.

21:14.806 --> 21:16.967
- Will you marry me?
- No.

21:17.008 --> 21:18.566
Say it like you mean it.

21:21.713 --> 21:24.580
- Andrew?
- Yes, Margaret?

21:24.616 --> 21:27.710
- Sweet Andrew?
- I'm listening.

21:27.752 --> 21:30.744
Would you please,
with cherries on top, marry me?

21:33.358 --> 21:36.020
OK. I don't appreciate the sarcasm,
but I'll do it.

21:36.061 --> 21:38.689
- See you at the airport tomorrow.
- Good.

21:51.610 --> 21:55.102
So, these are the questions
that INS is gonna ask us.

21:55.146 --> 21:58.138
Now, the good news is is
I know everything about you,

21:58.183 --> 21:59.878
but the bad news is
that you have four days

21:59.918 --> 22:04.719
to learn all this about me.
So, you should... probably get studying.

22:08.293 --> 22:10.557
You know all the answers
to these questions about me?

22:10.595 --> 22:12.620
- Scary, isn't it?
- A little bit.

22:12.664 --> 22:15.064
- What am I allergic to?
- Pine nuts.

22:15.100 --> 22:17.034
And the full spectrum of human emotion.

22:17.068 --> 22:19.036
Oh, that's... that was funny.

22:19.070 --> 22:20.867
- Mmm-hmm.
- Umm...

22:20.905 --> 22:23.772
Here's a good one. Do I have any scars?

22:23.808 --> 22:25.708
I'm pretty sure that you have a tattoo.

22:25.744 --> 22:27.405
Oh, you're pretty sure?

22:27.445 --> 22:29.811
I'm pretty sure. Two years ago,
your dermatologist called

22:29.848 --> 22:31.782
and asked about a Q-switched laser.

22:31.816 --> 22:33.374
I of course Googled a Q-switched laser

22:33.418 --> 22:35.716
and found that they
in fact do remove tattoos.

22:35.754 --> 22:37.312
But you canceled your appointment.

22:38.890 --> 22:40.448
So what is it? Tribal ink?

22:40.492 --> 22:42.426
Japanese calligraphy? Barbed wire?

22:42.460 --> 22:45.293
You know, it's exciting for me
to experience you like this.

22:45.330 --> 22:47.594
Thank you. You're gonna have
to tell me where it is, though.

22:47.632 --> 22:49.099
- No, I'm not.
- They're gonna ask.

22:49.134 --> 22:51.659
We're done with that question.
We're done with that question.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.898
On to another question.
Let me see, let me see.

22:53.938 --> 22:56.805
Oh, here's one. Whose place do we
stay at, yours or mine?

22:56.841 --> 22:58.240
That's easy. Mine.

22:58.276 --> 23:00.141
And why wouldn't we stay at mine?

23:00.178 --> 23:02.669
Because I live at Central Park West.

23:02.714 --> 23:05.649
And you probably live at some
squalid little studio apartment

23:05.684 --> 23:08.653
with stacks of yellowed
Penguin Classics.

23:08.687 --> 23:11.656
<i> Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>please fasten your seat belts.</i>

23:11.690 --> 23:14.284
<i>We are beginning our descent</i>
<i>into Juneau.</i>

23:14.325 --> 23:16.054
Juneau? I thought
we were going to Sitka.

23:17.328 --> 23:21.355
- We are.
- How are we getting to Sitka?

23:25.437 --> 23:26.529
Whoa.

23:50.528 --> 23:53.793
All right. Here we go.

23:56.234 --> 23:58.168
- Oh, there he is!
- Andrew!

24:05.043 --> 24:06.704
Hi. Right this way...

24:10.281 --> 24:12.078
- Hi!
- Oh...

24:12.117 --> 24:14.711
- It's so good to see you!
- You're suffocating him, Grace.

24:14.753 --> 24:16.653
- Come here.
- Hey, Gammy.

24:16.688 --> 24:19.452
Ah, Gammy. How are you doing?
Where's Dad?

24:19.491 --> 24:22.187
Oh, you know your father.
He's always working.

24:22.227 --> 24:24.593
Never mind about him. Where's your girl?

24:24.629 --> 24:27.097
Uh, she's... right there.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.724
- Ah.
- There she is.

24:28.767 --> 24:31.736
I guess the word "girl"
is inappropriate.

24:31.770 --> 24:33.101
Annie.

24:34.205 --> 24:35.229
- Hi!
- Hello.

24:35.273 --> 24:37.036
- Margaret, this is my mom.
- Oh, hello.

24:37.075 --> 24:39.509
Yeah, great. This is my gammy, Annie.

24:39.544 --> 24:42.638
- Pleasure.
- Well, hello there.

24:42.680 --> 24:47.674
Now, do you prefer being called Margaret
or Satan's Mistress?

24:47.719 --> 24:49.584
We've heard it both ways.

24:49.621 --> 24:51.418
Actually we've heard it
lots of ways.

24:51.456 --> 24:53.048
She's kidding.

24:53.091 --> 24:55.559
Oh! Oh... OK.

24:55.593 --> 24:57.060
Thank you so much for...

24:57.095 --> 24:58.790
allowing me to be a part
of this weekend.

24:58.830 --> 25:02.027
Oh, you're welcome.
We're thrilled to have you.

25:02.066 --> 25:03.795
Let's get you two back to the fort.

25:03.835 --> 25:05.962
- OK.
- Oh...

25:06.004 --> 25:09.030
- It's so good to see you.
- There we are.

25:42.907 --> 25:44.169
Andrew...

25:44.209 --> 25:47.667
Andrew. Andrew!

25:49.547 --> 25:52.141
Please, don't do that.

25:52.183 --> 25:55.346
You didn't tell me about all
the family businesses, honey.

25:55.386 --> 25:58.583
He was probably just
being modest, dear.

25:58.623 --> 26:00.113
Oh.

26:07.565 --> 26:10.693
What are we doing? Shouldn't we
check into our hotel right now?

26:10.735 --> 26:13.135
Oh, we canceled your reservation.

26:13.171 --> 26:14.604
Family doesn't stay at a hotel.

26:14.639 --> 26:16.334
You're gonna stay in our home.

26:16.374 --> 26:18.365
Oh, great! Great.

26:18.409 --> 26:19.808
- What?
- God.

26:19.844 --> 26:22.039
You're gonna wanna use your legs
to lift that one.

26:22.080 --> 26:24.913
Andrew! Help her with those.

26:24.949 --> 26:27.440
I'd love to, but she won't let me
do anything.

26:27.485 --> 26:30.977
She insists on doing it all herself.
She's one of those... she's a feminist.

26:40.198 --> 26:41.426
Come on, sweetie.

26:42.901 --> 26:45.495
You see the shoes
that broad was wearing?

26:55.046 --> 26:56.172
This is the last of 'em.

26:57.749 --> 26:59.011
- Oh!
- Ooh.

26:59.050 --> 27:02.213
- Five second rule.
- Got it!

27:02.253 --> 27:04.585
That will dry right off.

27:04.622 --> 27:06.852
Psst! Psst!
I'm not getting on that boat.

27:06.891 --> 27:08.756
You don't have to.
See you in a few days.

27:08.793 --> 27:11.023
Psst! You know I can't swim.

27:11.062 --> 27:13.553
Hence, the boat.

27:20.538 --> 27:21.937
Come on.

27:26.444 --> 27:28.412
Come on. Here we go.

27:35.153 --> 27:38.384
Looking good, boss.
Take your time, though.

27:38.423 --> 27:40.482
Shh.

27:45.196 --> 27:47.391
She comes with a lot of baggage.

27:47.432 --> 27:48.763
Just gonna give you
a little hand here.

27:50.735 --> 27:53.670
Hand off ass! Off ass!

27:56.240 --> 27:59.334
There you go. You're there.

28:03.614 --> 28:07.641
Congratulations.
I'm a hundred years old now.

28:34.012 --> 28:36.139
Here we are. We're home.

28:38.483 --> 28:40.542
That is your home?

28:41.853 --> 28:43.980
Who are you people?

28:58.336 --> 28:59.860
Why did you tell me
you were poor?

28:59.904 --> 29:02.737
- I never said I was poor.
- But you never told me you were rich.

29:02.774 --> 29:04.969
I'm not rich. My parents are rich.

29:05.009 --> 29:07.443
OK, you know what?
That's something only rich people say.

29:07.478 --> 29:09.002
Hey, Andrew! Welcome home!

29:09.047 --> 29:11.777
Hi! Mom, what is this?

29:11.816 --> 29:14.444
Nothing. It's just a little
welcoming party.

29:14.485 --> 29:15.713
Is that a crime?

29:15.753 --> 29:17.880
Just 50 of our closest
friends and neighbors.

29:17.922 --> 29:19.583
And all excited to meet you.

29:19.624 --> 29:21.956
- Oh, good. Good.
- Come on. Come on.

29:21.993 --> 29:24.291
- A party?
- Yeah, I guess so.

29:24.328 --> 29:26.956
Come on. Let's go. My grandma's
moving faster than you.

29:28.566 --> 29:29.965
Put your back into it.

29:35.606 --> 29:37.801
So nice to meet you,
Margaret. Welcome to Sitka.

29:37.842 --> 29:39.833
Jill? Hi. Nice to meet you.
My pleasure.

29:39.877 --> 29:43.040
Why didn't you tell me you were
some kind of Alaskan Kennedy?

29:43.081 --> 29:44.139
How could I?

29:44.182 --> 29:47.674
We were in the middle of talking about
you for the last three years.

29:47.718 --> 29:49.413
OK, know what? Timeout, OK?

29:49.454 --> 29:51.183
This bickering Bickerson thing
has got to stop.

29:51.222 --> 29:53.213
People need to think that we are
in love. So let's just...

29:53.257 --> 29:54.781
That, that's no problem.
I can do that.

29:54.826 --> 29:57.693
I can pretend to be the doting fiancé.
That's easy.

29:57.728 --> 29:59.195
But for you, it's going to require

29:59.230 --> 30:01.630
that you stop snacking on
children while they dream.

30:01.666 --> 30:04.362
Very funny. When are you going
to tell them we're engaged?

30:04.402 --> 30:05.767
I'll pick the right moment.

30:05.803 --> 30:09.671
Hey, Andrew. Hi!

30:09.707 --> 30:12.335
Mrs. McKittrick. How are you?
Nice to see you.

30:12.376 --> 30:14.367
Nice to see you, Mr. McKittrick.
This is Margaret.

30:14.412 --> 30:16.277
- Hi. Pleasure.
- Margaret!

30:16.314 --> 30:17.713
Hi, how are you? Pleasure.

30:17.748 --> 30:21.149
So I always wanted to know,
what does a book editor do?

30:21.185 --> 30:23.278
That's a great question, Louise.

30:23.321 --> 30:25.721
I'm curious to know the answer myself.

30:26.824 --> 30:28.553
- Hello, Dad.
- Son.

30:29.360 --> 30:30.884
This must be Maggie.

30:30.928 --> 30:32.555
Uh, Margaret.

30:32.597 --> 30:36.055
- Joe. Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure's mine.

30:36.100 --> 30:39.695
So why don't you tell us exactly
what a book editor does.

30:39.737 --> 30:43.195
Besides taking writers out
to lunch and getting bombed.

30:43.241 --> 30:45.607
Now that sounds like fun.

30:45.643 --> 30:47.440
No wonder you like being an editor.

30:47.478 --> 30:50.709
No, Louise. Andrew's not an editor,
he's an editor's assistant.

30:50.748 --> 30:53.239
Maggie here is the editor.

30:53.284 --> 30:54.842
Margaret.

30:54.886 --> 30:58.378
- So you're actually...
- Andrew's boss. Yeah.

30:58.422 --> 31:00.049
Well. How about that.

31:00.091 --> 31:01.456
Huh.

31:01.492 --> 31:03.483
I think I'll get a refill.

31:05.663 --> 31:07.028
Charming.

31:10.835 --> 31:13.895
That's a hell of
a first impression, Dad.

31:13.938 --> 31:15.997
What the hell, Andrew?

31:16.040 --> 31:18.804
You show up here after all this
time with this woman you hated

31:18.843 --> 31:20.174
- and now she's your girlfriend?
- We just got here.

31:20.211 --> 31:21.508
Can we wait two seconds

31:21.546 --> 31:22.979
before we throw the
kitchen sink at each other?

31:23.014 --> 31:26.245
Just never figured you for a guy
who slept his way to the middle.

31:26.284 --> 31:27.979
Actually, I'll have you know
that that woman in there

31:28.019 --> 31:29.646
is one of the most
respected editors in town.

31:29.687 --> 31:30.779
She's your meal ticket,

31:30.821 --> 31:32.288
and you brought her home
to meet your mother.

31:32.323 --> 31:36.692
She's not my meal ticket, Dad.
She's my fiancée.

31:36.727 --> 31:39.287
- What'd you say?
- You heard me.

31:39.330 --> 31:41.127
I'm getting married.

31:44.702 --> 31:46.602
- How are you?
- Good, good. Thank you.

31:46.637 --> 31:47.968
Would you care for
some hors d'oeuvres?

31:48.005 --> 31:49.302
No, I'm fine. Thank you very much.

31:49.340 --> 31:50.671
It's a tradition.

31:50.708 --> 31:52.369
It's the texture. I'm not a fish person.

31:52.410 --> 31:54.810
- You'll like it.
- You're very sweet.

31:54.845 --> 31:57.439
I think if you'll just taste it.

31:57.481 --> 31:58.880
Thank you so much.

32:02.720 --> 32:03.846
Ladies and gentlemen...

32:03.888 --> 32:06.379
I have a very important
announcement to make.

32:06.424 --> 32:08.016
Margaret and I are getting married.

32:08.059 --> 32:09.321
It's the paprika.

32:09.360 --> 32:10.725
So sorry.

32:10.761 --> 32:13.559
That's OK. It's wash-and-wear.

32:15.399 --> 32:18.391
Yep. Honey? Where you at?

32:19.604 --> 32:20.901
Here it is.

32:23.874 --> 32:25.569
Come on down here, pumpkin.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.407
- All right.
- OK.

32:27.445 --> 32:30.005
Oh, look at her. Look at her.

32:31.249 --> 32:33.683
Right there, ladies and
gentlemen. There she is.

32:33.718 --> 32:36.152
Congratulations, Andrew.

32:36.187 --> 32:37.211
Thank you.

32:37.255 --> 32:39.120
Thank you very much.

32:39.156 --> 32:41.716
- Time to celebrate.
- Get the champagne.

32:44.695 --> 32:46.322
So that was your idea
of the perfect time

32:46.364 --> 32:47.558
- to tell them we're engaged?
- Mmm.

32:47.598 --> 32:49.259
'Cause it was brilliant.
Brilliant timing.

32:49.300 --> 32:51.268
Andrew. Hi.

32:51.302 --> 32:55.238
Gert? Oh, my God. Hey, hi. Wow.

32:55.273 --> 32:57.707
How you doing? I didn't know
that you were gonna be here.

32:57.742 --> 33:01.007
Your mom probably wanted it to
be a surprise. So... surprise.

33:01.045 --> 33:03.536
- Right.
- And...

33:03.581 --> 33:06.516
...we're being completely rude. Hi.

33:06.550 --> 33:09.747
- Oh, God. This is my ex...
- Hi. I'm Gertrude.

33:09.787 --> 33:12.221
- Oh! Oh, wow. Wow!
- You can call me Gert.

33:12.256 --> 33:14.451
Well, congratulations, you guys.

33:14.492 --> 33:15.925
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

33:15.960 --> 33:17.484
So did I miss the story?

33:18.296 --> 33:19.456
- What story?
- What story?

33:19.497 --> 33:21.260
About how you proposed.

33:21.299 --> 33:25.633
Oh! How a man proposes says
a lot about his character.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.729
- Yes.
- Yes, it does.

33:27.772 --> 33:30.400
I actually would love
to hear the story, Andrew.

33:30.441 --> 33:31.567
Would you tell us?

33:31.609 --> 33:33.941
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:33.978 --> 33:35.843
You know what?

33:35.880 --> 33:39.873
Actually, Margaret loves
telling this story...

33:39.917 --> 33:42.477
so I'm just gonna let her
go ahead and do that.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.715
'Cause I think we
should just sit in rapture.

33:44.755 --> 33:48.054
Huh! Wow, OK.

33:48.092 --> 33:51.926
Wow, where to begin... this story.

33:51.962 --> 33:54.954
Well... um, wow.

33:54.999 --> 33:57.058
Mmm... yeah.

33:57.101 --> 34:01.970
OK, well, um, Andrew and I...

34:02.006 --> 34:04.770
Andrew and I were about to celebrate

34:04.809 --> 34:07.403
- our first anniversary together.
- Aw...

34:07.445 --> 34:10.277
And I knew that he'd been
itching to ask me to marry him.

34:10.313 --> 34:13.511
And he was scared.
Like a little tiny bird.

34:13.551 --> 34:15.951
So I started leaving him
little hints here and there...

34:15.985 --> 34:18.750
...because I knew he wouldn't
have the guts to ask, but...

34:18.789 --> 34:21.621
That's not exactly how it happened.

34:21.659 --> 34:23.149
- No? Hmm.
- No. No.

34:23.194 --> 34:25.754
I mean, I picked up on
all her little hints.

34:25.795 --> 34:27.821
This woman's about as subtle as a gun.

34:27.864 --> 34:30.094
Yeah.

34:30.134 --> 34:31.465
What I was worried about was

34:31.502 --> 34:33.367
that she might find this little box...

34:33.404 --> 34:36.429
Oh! The decoupage box that he made

34:36.474 --> 34:38.635
where he'd taken the time to cut out

34:38.676 --> 34:41.440
tiny, little pictures of himself. Yes.

34:41.478 --> 34:45.176
Just pasted all over the
box. Oh! So beautiful.

34:45.216 --> 34:47.650
So I opened that beautiful,
little decoupage

34:47.685 --> 34:51.553
and out fluttered these tiny,
little hand-cut heart confettis.

34:51.589 --> 34:55.685
And once they cleared,
I looked down, and I saw...

34:55.726 --> 34:58.388
...the most beautiful, big...

34:58.429 --> 34:59.953
...fat nothing.

34:59.997 --> 35:01.362
No ring.

35:01.399 --> 35:02.991
- No ring?
- What?

35:03.033 --> 35:06.025
No. But inside that box...

35:06.070 --> 35:07.731
...underneath all that crap...

35:07.772 --> 35:10.036
...there was a little
handwritten note...

35:10.074 --> 35:13.601
with the address to
a hotel, date, and time.

35:13.644 --> 35:15.339
Real Humphrey Bogart-type stuff.

35:15.379 --> 35:16.744
Yeah.

35:16.781 --> 35:18.612
Masculine.

35:18.649 --> 35:20.514
Anyway, naturally, Margaret thought...

35:20.551 --> 35:22.109
I thought he was seeing someone else.

35:22.153 --> 35:24.280
It was a terrible time for me,

35:24.321 --> 35:26.687
but I went to that hotel anyway.

35:26.724 --> 35:28.817
I went there and I pounded on the door,

35:28.859 --> 35:30.690
but the door was already unlocked.

35:30.728 --> 35:34.596
And as swung open that
door, there he was...

35:34.632 --> 35:36.156
- Standing.
- Kneeling.

35:36.200 --> 35:37.758
- Like a man.
- On a bed of rose petals,

35:37.802 --> 35:41.260
in a tuxedo. Your son. Your son.

35:41.305 --> 35:44.866
And he was choking back
soft, soft sobs.

35:44.909 --> 35:48.174
And when he held back the tears
and finally caught his breath,

35:48.212 --> 35:49.270
he said to me...

35:49.313 --> 35:50.371
"Margaret, will you marry me?"

35:50.414 --> 35:53.747
And she said, "Yep."
The end. Who's hungry?

35:56.120 --> 35:58.782
That is quite a story.

35:58.823 --> 36:00.723
- Oh, Andy!
- Gorgeous.

36:00.758 --> 36:03.192
You are so sensitive.

36:03.994 --> 36:06.986
Hand-cut confetti?

36:07.031 --> 36:09.864
Hey! Let's see a kiss
from you two cuties.

36:09.900 --> 36:10.992
Give her a kiss!

36:11.035 --> 36:13.094
- No. Come on.
- Oh, yeah.

36:13.137 --> 36:14.161
Come on!

36:14.205 --> 36:15.763
OK, all right.

36:15.806 --> 36:17.671
OK. Here we go. Ready?

36:19.310 --> 36:23.576
What is this? Kiss her on
the mouth like you mean it.

36:23.614 --> 36:27.209
- Kiss her. Kiss her!
- Kiss her!

36:27.251 --> 36:31.153
Kiss her! Kiss her!
Kiss her! Kiss her!

36:31.188 --> 36:32.815
OK!

36:33.991 --> 36:35.049
- OK. All right.
- OK.

36:35.092 --> 36:37.253
- Here we go.
- Mmm-hmm. OK.

36:38.963 --> 36:40.760
Oh!

36:40.798 --> 36:43.426
Andy! Give her a real kiss!

36:43.467 --> 36:46.129
- Gammy.
- A real one!

36:46.170 --> 36:47.694
- Yeah.
- You can do it!

36:47.738 --> 36:49.399
Why don't we just do it?
Let's just do it really fast.

36:50.407 --> 36:53.001
Mmmm.

36:53.043 --> 36:55.978
- Mmm.
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

36:56.013 --> 36:58.174
- OK.
- Mmm.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.017
Hmm.

37:09.760 --> 37:12.024
I'm so happy for you two!

37:12.062 --> 37:15.429
So happy! So happy!

37:15.466 --> 37:17.331
Let's get the champagne!

37:18.269 --> 37:20.203
So here we are.

37:22.039 --> 37:23.768
This is your bedroom.

37:25.009 --> 37:30.970
Wow. Wow, this is, um...
beautiful. And the view.

37:31.015 --> 37:32.812
And here's the bed.

37:32.850 --> 37:35.648
Wow! Exquisite bed. Exquisite.

37:35.686 --> 37:38.655
So... where is Andrew's room?

37:38.689 --> 37:40.623
Oh, sweetie, we're not
under any illusions

37:40.658 --> 37:43.525
that you two don't
sleep in the same bed.

37:43.561 --> 37:45.825
He'll sleep
in here with you.

37:45.863 --> 37:48.229
Oh, great, 'cause we love to snuggle.

37:48.265 --> 37:50.199
- Don't we, honey.
- We're huge snugglers.

37:50.234 --> 37:52.464
Oh, my God. What is it?

37:52.503 --> 37:56.405
- Calm down, Kevin.
- Whoa! You are cute.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.032
Who is this?

37:58.075 --> 38:01.670
- That's Kevin. I'm sorry, Margaret.
- So cute.

38:01.712 --> 38:03.771
We just rescued him from the pound,

38:03.814 --> 38:05.805
and he's still in training. Sorry.

38:05.849 --> 38:07.817
Just be sure you don't
let him outside,

38:07.851 --> 38:09.648
or the eagles will snatch him.

38:09.687 --> 38:11.552
No, don't you listen to her.

38:11.589 --> 38:13.386
She's just pulling
your leg, isn't she?

38:13.424 --> 38:16.757
By the way, there are extra
towels and linens and things

38:16.794 --> 38:17.852
in here if you need them.

38:17.895 --> 38:19.726
And if you
get chilly tonight...

38:19.763 --> 38:21.424
...use this.

38:21.465 --> 38:23.194
It has special powers.

38:23.233 --> 38:26.225
Oh, what kind of special powers?

38:26.270 --> 38:27.897
I call it the Baby Maker.

38:27.938 --> 38:30.031
OK, well. Then I guess we...

38:30.074 --> 38:31.598
...gonna be super careful with that one.

38:31.642 --> 38:33.769
- Yeah, I'm just gonna...
- Don't throw it on the bed.

38:33.811 --> 38:35.779
We'd better turn in.
It's been quite an evening.

38:35.813 --> 38:37.542
So good night, everybody.

38:37.581 --> 38:38.878
- Good night.
- Good night.

38:38.916 --> 38:41.908
- Good night.
- Good night, Gammy.

38:43.454 --> 38:45.115
- Good night.
- Good night.

38:47.791 --> 38:49.850
- Good night.
- Good night, Gammy.

38:49.893 --> 38:51.326
Thank you so much. Sweet dreams.

38:51.362 --> 38:53.057
- Bye-bye, now.
- Bye.

38:56.233 --> 38:59.168
So, uh... you haven't
been home in a while.

38:59.203 --> 39:02.502
I haven't had a lot of vacation
time the last three years.

39:02.539 --> 39:04.734
Stop complaining.

39:07.144 --> 39:10.272
Um... Don't look, OK?

39:11.148 --> 39:12.410
OK.

39:13.651 --> 39:14.879
Are your eyes closed?

39:14.918 --> 39:16.215
Completely.

39:16.253 --> 39:19.620
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

39:28.265 --> 39:31.962
Those are the pajamas you
decided to bring to Alaska.

39:32.002 --> 39:35.460
Yes, because I was supposed
to be in a hotel alone.

39:35.506 --> 39:38.498
- Remember?
- Can we just go to sleep?

39:38.542 --> 39:40.601
- Fine.
- Great.

40:10.307 --> 40:12.502
Well.

40:12.543 --> 40:13.805
Looks like I won't be
getting much sleep

40:13.844 --> 40:16.369
with the sun streaming in.

40:22.753 --> 40:24.243
Thank you.

40:45.509 --> 40:47.409
Andrew. Phone.

40:47.945 --> 40:50.914
Andrew!

40:50.948 --> 40:53.348
Crap. Andrew, Andrew, phone.

40:53.383 --> 40:54.748
Andrew!

40:54.785 --> 40:56.719
Yeah... right.

41:00.357 --> 41:03.884
- Andrew, where is it?
- Purse, side pocket.

41:08.832 --> 41:12.495
Hello. Hello? Hello.

41:12.536 --> 41:14.401
Frank! Frank, darling.

41:14.438 --> 41:15.496
Darling, Frank.

41:15.539 --> 41:17.837
Are you there? Hello? Hello? Oh, crap.

41:17.875 --> 41:21.333
I have horrible service, Frank.
Give me just one minute.

41:21.378 --> 41:23.141
Oh, my God! Margaret!

41:23.180 --> 41:25.740
One... one minute.
Frank, hold on just a second.

41:25.783 --> 41:26.807
Frank, hold on. No, no, no, no.

41:27.985 --> 41:30.715
Frank. Frank, I'm sorry you feel

41:30.754 --> 41:33.416
I pressured you into doing Oprah, but...

41:33.457 --> 41:36.915
Of course I want you
to be happy. Yes, yes.

41:36.960 --> 41:42.796
Frank. Frank. Frank, darling.
Frank? It's going to be fine.

41:42.833 --> 41:44.960
I can just call them and I can cancel.

41:49.606 --> 41:52.074
You are...
you are so right, Frank.

41:52.109 --> 41:54.236
Yes, Frank, of course
I'm listening to you.

41:54.278 --> 41:55.939
Yeah... yes.

41:55.979 --> 41:57.571
I love listening to you, Frank.

41:57.614 --> 42:01.175
Shh! Sit. Sit.

42:02.519 --> 42:03.645
No, not you, Frank.

42:03.687 --> 42:05.484
No, no.

42:05.522 --> 42:07.251
Frank, if I may get down to it, OK...

42:07.291 --> 42:10.818
I think it would be
a mistake to back out.

42:10.861 --> 42:14.058
Because, Frank, for so many years...

42:14.097 --> 42:17.555
...you have inspired me with your
beautiful words, and I feel that...

42:17.601 --> 42:19.228
Shh! Dog, I'm on the phone.

42:19.269 --> 42:22.170
I think it's time that the world
get to enjoy your words as well.

42:22.206 --> 42:23.730
They are just so rich

42:23.774 --> 42:24.900
with... passion...

42:24.942 --> 42:29.606
And I think that we
should all be privy to.

42:29.646 --> 42:31.341
Frank, I just, uh...

42:31.381 --> 42:32.973
I just, uh, want you
to be happy, Frank.

42:33.016 --> 42:35.507
Give me that dog!

42:35.552 --> 42:37.986
Frank, hold on a second.
Can you hold a second?

42:38.021 --> 42:39.045
Give me that dog!

42:40.757 --> 42:42.281
Come on! Come on, come on, come on.

42:42.326 --> 42:44.590
Come on! Come on! Oh, oh...

42:44.628 --> 42:47.153
Oh, oh! Oh, oh. OK! OK, gotcha.

42:47.197 --> 42:49.028
Frank, Frank.

42:49.066 --> 42:50.260
Frank? So sorry, so sorry.

42:50.300 --> 42:53.428
So sorry. I dropped the phone.
Now, listen, Frank.

42:53.470 --> 42:56.200
I don't want to sell you on anything,

42:56.240 --> 42:58.037
but this is your legacy, this book.

42:58.075 --> 42:59.474
And I think it's up to you to

42:59.509 --> 43:00.533
present your legacy to the world.

43:00.577 --> 43:03.774
And call me tomorrow with your decision.

43:03.814 --> 43:05.543
And my phone is on
all the time! OK, bye-bye.

43:05.582 --> 43:06.606
No! Wait!

43:07.351 --> 43:10.013
No! No! N-n-n... no. No

43:10.053 --> 43:11.577
Take the doggy. Look at the doggy.

43:11.622 --> 43:13.522
I need that phone. Take the dog.

43:13.557 --> 43:15.024
Take the dog. I need that phone!

43:15.058 --> 43:18.357
Here. Take the dog.
Take the dog. Take it. Take it.

43:18.395 --> 43:20.386
Look at this.

43:21.665 --> 43:24.395
- Is that cute or what?
- I know.

43:26.403 --> 43:29.133
Morning, guys. Have you seen... daah.

43:29.172 --> 43:32.300
She's playing with Kevin.
We thought she didn't like him.

43:32.342 --> 43:33.366
Will you go get her, Andy?

43:33.410 --> 43:35.378
We have a whole day planned for her,

43:35.412 --> 43:37.346
and she needs to get ready.

43:37.381 --> 43:39.645
Yeah. Tell her we have
a big surprise for her.

43:39.683 --> 43:41.310
Mmm.

43:43.887 --> 43:46.856
Look! Give me my phone. Come on.
Please, just give me my phone.

43:46.890 --> 43:49.518
- Come on. Right here.
- What the hell are you doing?

43:49.559 --> 43:52.551
Oh, my God. Your grandmother
was completely right.

43:52.596 --> 43:54.393
The eagle came
and tried to take the dog.

43:54.431 --> 43:57.889
But then I saved him. Then it
came back, and it took my phone.

43:57.935 --> 44:00.301
- Are you drunk?
- What? No! I'm serious.

44:00.337 --> 44:02.805
He's got my phone, and Frank's
calling me on that phone.

44:02.839 --> 44:04.170
Relax, all right?

44:04.207 --> 44:07.267
We'll order another phone, same number.
We'll go into town tomorrow and get it.

44:07.311 --> 44:08.369
- Really?
- Yeah.

44:08.412 --> 44:13.543
Oh, OK. All right. Well, you go then.

44:13.583 --> 44:15.414
- You have to get ready.
- For what?

44:15.452 --> 44:16.885
You're going out with Mom and the girls.

44:16.920 --> 44:19.582
- I don't want to go out.
- Shopping, sightseeing. And a surprise.

44:19.623 --> 44:21.090
- I hate shopping.
- You'll love it.

44:21.124 --> 44:22.591
- I hate sightseeing.
- You're going.

44:22.626 --> 44:23.888
- No, I don't want to go.
- You're going.

44:23.927 --> 44:25.554
- I'm not going. I'm not going.
- Yes, you are.

44:25.595 --> 44:27.062
Now give me a nice big hug.
We don't want them

44:27.097 --> 44:28.223
- to think we're fighting.
- I don't want to touch you.

44:28.265 --> 44:30.062
- Come on. Hug time.
- No, I don't want to...

44:30.100 --> 44:31.829
- Hug time.
- I don't want to...

44:31.868 --> 44:33.631
There we go.

44:33.670 --> 44:36.366
Yeah, that's nice.

44:36.406 --> 44:39.102
Yeah. That's nice.

44:39.142 --> 44:41.702
There we go. Isn't that nice?

44:41.745 --> 44:43.269
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

44:43.313 --> 44:44.780
- Mmm. Yeah.
- Boop boop boop.

44:44.815 --> 44:47.079
If you touch my ass one more time,

44:47.117 --> 44:49.278
I will cut your balls
off in your sleep. OK?

44:49.319 --> 44:51.150
- Yeah.
- There you go.

44:51.188 --> 44:53.850
All righty now. So, uh...
We clear on that?

44:53.890 --> 44:56.256
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Such a good fiancé.

44:56.293 --> 44:58.090
Hmm. Ow.

45:11.541 --> 45:14.772
- Jeez.
- You want to see me?

45:14.811 --> 45:17.507
Your mom found these eco-balls.

45:17.547 --> 45:19.412
They dissolve in water.

45:21.051 --> 45:23.781
I don't know how she
comes up with this stuff.

45:23.820 --> 45:27.779
Anyway, she, uh... is a little peeved.

45:27.824 --> 45:31.817
Apparently, I wasn't the most
gracious of hosts last night.

45:31.862 --> 45:33.159
It was a little bit of a shock

45:33.196 --> 45:34.754
to find out that
you're getting married...

45:34.798 --> 45:38.029
...especially when none of us
even knew you were dating.

45:38.068 --> 45:42.869
The point is... I owe you an apology.

45:44.508 --> 45:46.669
Accepted.

45:46.710 --> 45:49.440
There's something else.

45:49.479 --> 45:53.313
I've been going over my
retirement plans recently,

45:53.350 --> 45:54.874
and it got me thinking.

45:56.586 --> 45:58.110
I've done a lot of things in my life.

45:58.155 --> 46:01.852
Practically built an empire with
your mother from the ground up.

46:01.892 --> 46:03.052
It doesn't mean anything unless...

46:03.093 --> 46:04.492
Unless you have someone to leave it to.

46:04.528 --> 46:07.964
- We already discussed this.
- I'd like to discuss it again.

46:07.998 --> 46:11.934
You have responsibilities here.

46:11.968 --> 46:13.731
I think I've been
more than understanding

46:13.770 --> 46:15.169
about your goofing off in New York.

46:15.205 --> 46:16.866
I need you to quit playing around...

46:16.907 --> 46:17.965
Here we go again.

46:18.008 --> 46:20.306
When are you going to start
taking what I do seriously?

46:20.343 --> 46:22.208
When you start acting seriously.

46:22.245 --> 46:24.713
I'm sorry.

46:24.748 --> 46:26.716
I feel sorry for you, Dad.

46:26.750 --> 46:29.275
I wish you had another son. I really do.

46:29.319 --> 46:30.479
One who wanted to stay here.

46:30.520 --> 46:32.283
One who wanted to take over
the family business.

46:32.322 --> 46:34.381
One who wanted to marry someone
that you approve of,

46:34.424 --> 46:37.757
but it's not me. Now,
it must seem strange to you,

46:37.794 --> 46:42.731
my life in New York... sitting
in an office, reading books.

46:42.766 --> 46:45.360
But it makes me happy. You understand?

46:48.538 --> 46:51.996
If that's what makes you happy,
son, I got nothing to say.

46:52.042 --> 46:54.067
Well, that's a first.

46:54.111 --> 46:58.810
You know what? Apology not
accepted. Have fun out here.

47:13.130 --> 47:14.620
There is no way you
could leave her at home.

47:14.664 --> 47:16.427
She had to be here. Absolutely.

47:16.466 --> 47:18.491
She's been coming here forever.

47:18.535 --> 47:21.299
I hope you are ready
for your big surprise...

47:21.338 --> 47:24.637
...because this is one of
Sitka's greatest treasures.

47:24.674 --> 47:26.938
- Right?
- Oh, yes. Oh, yeah.

47:28.812 --> 47:30.279
OK, this is the big surprise

47:30.313 --> 47:33.714
I was telling you about. You ready?

47:35.152 --> 47:37.882
Oh, Margaret,
you're gonna love it!

48:08.218 --> 48:10.516
Ramone's the only
exotic dancer on the island.

48:10.554 --> 48:12.784
But we're lucky to have him.

48:21.598 --> 48:23.122
Work it, Ramone!

48:24.668 --> 48:28.570
- Wow.
- Over here, Ramone! Over here.

48:28.605 --> 48:30.072
Over here, honey.

48:31.875 --> 48:33.740
Show her what
she's gonna be missing.

48:33.777 --> 48:35.108
Come, my sexy princess.

48:35.145 --> 48:36.840
- Yeah!
- Oh, no. Not necessary.

48:36.880 --> 48:39.747
It's a really nice gesture,
but I really need to just...

48:39.783 --> 48:41.011
Go on, Margaret. Get up there!

48:41.051 --> 48:42.109
You come dance.

48:42.152 --> 48:43.642
OK, pluck my eyes out. OK.

48:43.687 --> 48:47.316
All right. Here we go.

48:47.357 --> 48:49.416
Go, Margaret! Go, Margaret!

48:49.459 --> 48:52.587
Hey.

48:52.629 --> 48:53.653
Hey... oh.

48:53.697 --> 48:56.029
Give it to her, Ramone!

49:00.270 --> 49:02.704
Go on, Ramone! Give it to her!

49:15.118 --> 49:17.382
Ooh, that's a move I haven't seen.

49:19.522 --> 49:22.787
Look at her face!

49:22.826 --> 49:27.024
Guess who.
For you. For you. For you.

49:27.063 --> 49:29.964
- Yeah!
- Enjoy!

49:33.236 --> 49:38.139
I don't want to touch it.
No. OK, OK. Very sweet.

49:38.174 --> 49:39.300
No, no, no, no, no.

49:41.678 --> 49:42.770
Smack him!

49:42.812 --> 49:45.212
- I'm sorry?
- Smack his ass.

49:45.248 --> 49:47.216
Smack it. OK.

49:49.452 --> 49:52.888
- Smack him, Margaret!
- Give it to him!

49:52.922 --> 49:56.449
Yeah! Woo!

49:56.493 --> 49:58.290
Can I get down now?

50:09.005 --> 50:11.439
Free. Be free.

50:19.115 --> 50:21.845
Hey! There you are.
How are you holding up?

50:21.885 --> 50:26.015
Oh, fine. Fine. Just working on my tan.

50:26.056 --> 50:29.048
Yeah, the Paxtons can be
a bit overwhelming at times.

50:29.092 --> 50:30.218
Yes, yes.

50:31.328 --> 50:33.455
It's a little different
than New York, huh?

50:33.496 --> 50:36.954
Little bit. Little bit. You ever been?

50:37.000 --> 50:39.992
No. That was always
Andrew's dream, not mine.

50:40.036 --> 50:42.402
You guys were pretty serious, huh?

50:42.439 --> 50:45.169
Well, I mean, we dated in high
school and all through college,

50:45.208 --> 50:47.301
but we were kids.

50:49.112 --> 50:51.603
And you guys called it off because of...

50:53.683 --> 50:56.015
Well, um...

50:56.052 --> 51:00.716
the night before we graduated
school, he proposed...

51:00.757 --> 51:02.281
...and said he wanted to elope

51:02.325 --> 51:05.089
and run away to New York with me.

51:05.128 --> 51:07.688
And...

51:07.731 --> 51:09.596
You said "no."

51:09.632 --> 51:12.567
And I said "no," yeah.

51:12.602 --> 51:16.538
I've never been anywhere
but here. This is home.

51:16.573 --> 51:21.374
But anyway... you're a lucky girl.

51:21.411 --> 51:26.644
He really is the best, which
you obviously already know.

51:26.683 --> 51:31.450
Oh, yep. Yep, very much so, yeah.

51:31.488 --> 51:34.685
Well, cheers to you guys.

51:35.692 --> 51:39.651
Oh... Thank you.

51:44.367 --> 51:47.234
Looks like Ramone's
wrappin' it up.

51:48.171 --> 51:52.107
Go, Annie!

51:52.142 --> 51:54.201
I've never seen him so...

51:54.244 --> 51:56.303
- No, he really got down.
...out there. I mean...

51:56.346 --> 52:00.544
He was wonderful.

52:01.050 --> 52:02.312
Oh, no.

52:07.624 --> 52:09.956
Andrew!

52:09.993 --> 52:12.257
Andrew, honey, is everything OK?

52:15.765 --> 52:17.596
What... What's he doing?

52:17.634 --> 52:20.102
Something's up. It's best
to leave him alone.

52:20.136 --> 52:21.398
Come on, honey.

52:25.508 --> 52:27.533
<i>... Hunt's version</i>
<i>of that here tonight.</i>

52:27.577 --> 52:30.273
Hey, hey, hey. What are you
doing? I'm watching that.

52:30.313 --> 52:31.644
Why is Andrew out there

52:31.681 --> 52:34.081
hollowing out that old
stupid canoe again?

52:34.117 --> 52:36.551
Well, maybe he's
planning to escape. What?

52:36.586 --> 52:38.383
I am so tired.

52:38.421 --> 52:40.252
Think I'm gonna go
upstairs, take a shower,

52:40.290 --> 52:42.485
wash off Ramone's coconut body oil.

52:42.525 --> 52:43.890
Sure.

52:43.927 --> 52:46.259
I had a great day today. Thank you.

52:48.531 --> 52:49.555
What did you do?

52:49.599 --> 52:51.829
I didn't do anything, I mean...

52:51.868 --> 52:55.827
I just had a frank conversation
with him about his future.

52:55.872 --> 52:58.500
Oh... Well, yeah.
That's a good idea.

52:58.541 --> 53:00.008
That's a good idea, Joe,

53:00.043 --> 53:02.273
because he will never
come back home now.

53:02.312 --> 53:05.907
He is my son. I only get
to see him every three years

53:05.949 --> 53:08.383
because of you. Because of you.

53:08.418 --> 53:09.476
I've had enough.

53:09.519 --> 53:11.987
- You are gonna be supportive...
- Shh!

53:12.021 --> 53:13.147
...of him marrying
Margaret, and that is that.

53:13.189 --> 53:15.987
Shh! Shh! Shh!

53:16.025 --> 53:17.583
You know, if we're not careful,

53:17.627 --> 53:20.528
we are gonna end up in
this great big house...

53:20.563 --> 53:22.690
...just you and me alone...

53:22.732 --> 53:24.461
...you and me and everything
that we're angry about,

53:24.501 --> 53:27.800
and God forbid that they
should have a grandchild

53:27.837 --> 53:29.532
that we never get to see.

53:29.572 --> 53:33.633
You are going to fix this,
Joe. I mean it. Fix it now.

53:43.019 --> 53:46.216
Where's a towel?

53:51.895 --> 53:53.385
Towel...

53:55.398 --> 53:58.561
Towel, towel, towel... towel, towel.

53:58.601 --> 54:00.432
This is all they have for a towel?

54:00.470 --> 54:02.961
It's ridiculous. I can't get dry.

54:05.975 --> 54:07.033
Hello.

54:08.745 --> 54:09.837
Hello?

54:15.718 --> 54:17.049
Oh!

54:19.322 --> 54:20.846
Oh! Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

54:20.890 --> 54:21.914
No, no, no, no, no.

54:21.958 --> 54:23.721
J-j-just... I'm sorry.

54:23.760 --> 54:25.921
L-l-let me just,
let me just get a towel.

54:25.962 --> 54:27.395
Let me just get a towel.

54:27.430 --> 54:29.364
Just... look.

54:29.399 --> 54:31.060
You need to just... I'm sorry.

54:31.100 --> 54:32.590
OK, I'm sorry for
feeding you to the eagle.

54:32.635 --> 54:34.102
I'm sorry.

54:38.741 --> 54:39.901
Go away. Go away.

54:39.943 --> 54:42.207
Go, go. Just let me get a towel.

54:42.245 --> 54:45.305
Go, go, go... Hold on.

54:51.654 --> 54:53.349
Yeah. Huh?

54:53.389 --> 54:56.415
How you like that? Huh?

54:56.459 --> 54:58.393
Take it, take it. That's right.

54:58.428 --> 55:01.056
That's what I'm talking
about. You like that?

55:03.166 --> 55:05.896
Oh. You like it.

55:10.840 --> 55:13.809
Come here. Come to Mama.

55:13.843 --> 55:15.902
That's right. Get on the carpet.

55:15.945 --> 55:17.936
That's a good boy.

55:17.981 --> 55:22.247
Yes! That's good, boy! Come on.

55:22.285 --> 55:23.946
Come on!

55:23.987 --> 55:25.511
Oh, oh!

55:29.092 --> 55:32.584
- Oh, oh!
- What the?

55:32.629 --> 55:35.154
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

55:35.198 --> 55:37.598
- Why are you naked? My God!
- Oh, God. Why are you wet?

55:37.634 --> 55:40.228
- Don't look at me.
- I don't understand.

55:40.269 --> 55:41.759
- Why are you wet?
- Why are you naked?

55:41.804 --> 55:43.465
Don't look at me.

55:43.506 --> 55:46.100
Oh, God! You're showing everything.

55:46.142 --> 55:48.133
Cover it up, for the love of God!

55:48.177 --> 55:52.443
Oh, God, not the Baby Maker.

55:52.482 --> 55:54.006
Explain yourself please.

55:54.050 --> 55:56.280
- Explain myself?
- Yes, explain yourself.

55:56.319 --> 55:57.479
- I was outside.
- Oh, really?

55:57.520 --> 55:59.784
- You didn't hear me?
- I was listening to...

55:59.822 --> 56:01.016
What are you even doing home?

56:01.057 --> 56:03.184
Then you just, jump me
out of nowhere? What's that?

56:03.226 --> 56:04.955
I di... I didn't mean to jump you.

56:04.994 --> 56:09.294
Your dog was attacking me, and I
had to run, and I ran into you.

56:09.332 --> 56:10.959
What is it with you and this dog?

56:11.000 --> 56:12.991
Just, you know, just... go.

56:13.036 --> 56:14.333
- Go...
- Fine.

56:14.370 --> 56:15.962
- Go take a shower. You stink.
- Fine.

56:16.005 --> 56:17.836
- Nice tattoo, by the way.
- What?

56:19.976 --> 56:22.376
See? See? Exactly. You see that?

56:22.412 --> 56:25.006
Oh... barely made it out
with my life there.

56:25.048 --> 56:26.982
See the size of the teeth on that thing?

56:27.016 --> 56:28.415
I didn't...

56:42.532 --> 56:48.129
So... So naked.

56:49.672 --> 56:52.072
Can we, uh, not talk about that, please?

56:53.242 --> 56:54.766
Just sayin'.

56:59.649 --> 57:02.209
So, uh, what's the deal
with you and your father?

57:02.251 --> 57:06.881
Ooh, I'm sorry. That question
is not in the binder.

57:06.923 --> 57:09.289
Oh, really? Well, I thought
you were the one that said

57:09.325 --> 57:10.656
we needed to learn all this...

57:10.693 --> 57:12.251
Not about that, I didn't.

57:12.295 --> 57:14.195
- But if the guy asks us...
- Not about that, Margaret.

57:14.230 --> 57:16.061
Good night.

57:31.080 --> 57:35.483
- I like the Psychic Network.
- What?

57:35.518 --> 57:38.282
Not in the "ha-ha, isn't that
funny, she likes that trash"

57:38.321 --> 57:41.381
kind of way. I actually quite enjoy it.

57:41.424 --> 57:42.982
Umm...

57:46.129 --> 57:49.064
I took disco lessons in the sixth grade.

57:51.234 --> 57:55.261
My first concert was
Rob Base & D.J. E-Z Rock.

57:57.507 --> 57:59.771
I think Brian Dennehy is sexy.

58:01.210 --> 58:02.507
Don't like flowers in the house,

58:02.545 --> 58:05.844
'cause they remind me of funerals.

58:05.882 --> 58:07.406
Never played a video game.

58:08.518 --> 58:11.453
I read <i>Wuthering Heights</i>
every Christmas.

58:11.487 --> 58:13.853
It's my favorite book.

58:16.659 --> 58:21.119
Haven't slept with a man
in over a year and a half.

58:23.099 --> 58:25.693
And, uh... I went to
the bathroom and cried

58:25.735 --> 58:28.761
after Bob called me a poisonous bitch.

58:30.373 --> 58:33.240
And the, uh, bird tattoo?

58:33.276 --> 58:34.675
They're swallows.

58:37.246 --> 58:41.307
Got them when I was 16...
after my parents died.

58:43.753 --> 58:46.779
Stupid.

58:46.823 --> 58:48.916
I'm sure there's many many other things,

58:48.958 --> 58:51.426
but that's all I can
come up with right now.

58:58.568 --> 59:00.035
You, uh, there?

59:03.039 --> 59:04.301
I'm here.

59:06.976 --> 59:08.739
Just processing.

59:15.451 --> 59:17.749
You really haven't slept
with anyone in 18 months?

59:17.787 --> 59:20.278
Oh, my God. Out of all that,
that's all you got?

59:20.323 --> 59:21.790
That's a long time.

59:21.824 --> 59:24.122
Yeah, well, I've been a little busy.

59:24.160 --> 59:26.287
Yeah...

59:28.831 --> 59:30.731
Who's, uh...

59:30.766 --> 59:33.894
- Rob Base and D. J...
- E-Z Rock?

59:33.936 --> 59:35.699
- Yeah.
- You know.

59:42.545 --> 59:44.410
- No. They were good.
- Mm-mm.

59:48.117 --> 59:52.247
- What?
- Nothing.

59:52.288 --> 59:55.815
I know who they are. I just
wanted to hear you sing it.

01:00:03.966 --> 01:00:06.833
- Margaret?
- Yes?

01:00:08.704 --> 01:00:11.172
Don't take this the wrong way.

01:00:12.808 --> 01:00:15.572
'K.

01:00:15.611 --> 01:00:20.639
You are a very... very beautiful woman.

01:00:46.175 --> 01:00:48.143
- Feel it deep, feel it low.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:00:49.845 --> 01:00:52.541
God, I can't sing that high.

01:01:16.205 --> 01:01:17.832
Huh? Where am I?

01:01:19.709 --> 01:01:21.074
What time is it?

01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:22.668
What time is it?

01:01:22.712 --> 01:01:26.341
Ooh! Ooh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh...

01:01:39.495 --> 01:01:40.621
Oh, God.

01:02:02.852 --> 01:02:06.652
Room service.
Breakfast for the happy couple.

01:02:06.689 --> 01:02:09.214
Andrew! Andrew!

01:02:09.258 --> 01:02:12.193
Andr...

01:02:12.228 --> 01:02:13.695
Your mother's at the door. Get up!

01:02:13.729 --> 01:02:15.094
- Get up here! Your mother's...
- Oh, God.

01:02:15.131 --> 01:02:16.723
Just a second!

01:02:21.103 --> 01:02:23.401
- Not the baby blanket.
- OK, all right.

01:02:23.439 --> 01:02:26.169
Not the baby blanket. Get it
off, get it off, get it off.

01:02:26.208 --> 01:02:28.142
- OK, all right.
- Wait a second. Hold on.

01:02:28.177 --> 01:02:30.145
- What? What?
- Are you wearing makeup?

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:31.908
What? No. Of course not.

01:02:31.947 --> 01:02:35.007
- OK, what do we do? All right.
- Just spoon me, spoon me...

01:02:35.051 --> 01:02:37.815
- Oh, my God! What is that?
- I'm sorry. It's morning.

01:02:37.853 --> 01:02:39.821
What do you mean, "It's morning"?

01:02:39.855 --> 01:02:41.516
Are you OK?

01:02:41.557 --> 01:02:44.390
Yep! Coming. One second. Yep.
Come on in. Everything's fine.

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:46.918
Disgusting.

01:02:46.962 --> 01:02:48.759
Ow, you're on my hair. OK, just...

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:57.335
- Oh, wow.
- Ooh, smells good.

01:02:57.373 --> 01:02:58.772
Cinnamon rolls.

01:02:58.808 --> 01:03:00.901
Oh, you shouldn't have
gone to that trouble.

01:03:00.943 --> 01:03:03.912
Oh, you're family now. It's no trouble.

01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:06.346
Hey, you have room for one more?

01:03:06.382 --> 01:03:10.512
Wow. Could we not do the
Brady family meeting right now?

01:03:10.553 --> 01:03:11.577
We just got up...

01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:13.019
- Yeah.
...if you don't mind.

01:03:13.055 --> 01:03:15.114
Your mother and I have
come up with a proposition

01:03:15.157 --> 01:03:18.354
and I happen to think
it's a terrific idea...

01:03:18.394 --> 01:03:20.658
We want you
to get married here tomorrow.

01:03:20.696 --> 01:03:21.822
Tomorrow.

01:03:23.732 --> 01:03:25.859
- What? What? What?
- Mmm-mmm. No.

01:03:25.901 --> 01:03:27.562
Well, you're gonna get married anyway,

01:03:27.603 --> 01:03:30.003
so why don't you get married here...

01:03:30.039 --> 01:03:31.438
...where we can be all together,

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:34.773
and that way Grandma Annie
can be a part of it.

01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:36.971
- Oh. Oh, we're...
- No.

01:03:37.012 --> 01:03:40.345
No. No, it's Gammy's
big birthday tomorrow night.

01:03:40.382 --> 01:03:41.474
Big day for her.

01:03:41.517 --> 01:03:43.610
We don't want to ruin it.
That's you know...

01:03:43.652 --> 01:03:47.383
I've had 89 birthday parties,
I don't need another one.

01:03:47.423 --> 01:03:48.822
Oh, Gammy.

01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:51.326
It would be a dream come true for me

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.726
to see my one grandchild's wedding.

01:03:53.762 --> 01:03:56.026
- A dream come true!
- Mmmm.

01:03:56.065 --> 01:03:59.262
- So you'll do it?
- Mmm-mmm.

01:03:59.301 --> 01:04:00.962
Before I'm dead?

01:04:01.003 --> 01:04:02.402
- OK. OK.
- OK.

01:04:04.707 --> 01:04:06.971
OK, we will do everything.

01:04:07.009 --> 01:04:09.569
And you can get married
like we did, in the barn.

01:04:09.612 --> 01:04:11.739
It's a Paxton family tradition.

01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:14.476
- Oh, wow!
- Yup.

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:19.819
Wow! Uh! I've always wanted to
get married in a... in a barn.

01:04:19.855 --> 01:04:22.187
- I have.
- It's a sign.

01:04:22.224 --> 01:04:25.990
A sign from the universe that
you're meant to be together.

01:04:26.028 --> 01:04:29.191
Oh, we must give thanks, I tell you.

01:04:29.231 --> 01:04:32.359
Come, come. We must give thanks.

01:04:32.401 --> 01:04:35.029
OK, I know I should leave you alone now.

01:04:35.070 --> 01:04:38.528
But we're just so excited!
I know you're excited, too.

01:04:38.574 --> 01:04:40.474
- It's the craziest.
- Really excited.

01:04:40.509 --> 01:04:43.910
Yeah! Go. Go.

01:04:43.946 --> 01:04:45.038
Go.

01:04:49.485 --> 01:04:52.818
Oh, my God.

01:04:52.855 --> 01:04:54.755
When my mom finds out that
this whole thing is a sham

01:04:54.790 --> 01:04:56.121
she's gonna... she's gonna be crushed,

01:04:56.158 --> 01:04:58.353
and my grandmother's gonna die.

01:04:58.394 --> 01:05:00.021
- Your mom's not going to find out.
- I... my father.

01:05:00.062 --> 01:05:01.620
What the hell's with that?
The whole wedding thing?

01:05:01.664 --> 01:05:02.688
Where did that come from?

01:05:02.731 --> 01:05:04.961
She probably got him worked up into it.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.228
It's fine. She's not gonna find out.

01:05:06.268 --> 01:05:08.395
- They're not going to find out.
- Oh, God. Margaret!

01:05:08.437 --> 01:05:11.895
Andrew, they're not gonna
find out, OK? Just relax.

01:05:11.941 --> 01:05:13.499
It's gonna be OK.

01:05:13.542 --> 01:05:16.033
It's not like we're
gonna be married forever.

01:05:16.078 --> 01:05:18.672
We'll be happily divorced
before you know it.

01:05:18.714 --> 01:05:23.117
It will be fine. It will be fine.

01:05:23.152 --> 01:05:24.710
You OK?

01:05:24.753 --> 01:05:26.380
Yeah.

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:33.452
- Get us some coffee.
- Yeah.

01:05:33.495 --> 01:05:37.192
So, would you like a cinnamon soy latte?

01:05:37.233 --> 01:05:38.962
A-ha.

01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:45.164
You're right, you know...

01:05:45.207 --> 01:05:46.504
Get a quickie divorce, we'll be fine.

01:05:46.542 --> 01:05:48.169
- Absolutely.
- It's gonna be fine.

01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:50.576
Everything is going to be great.

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:52.513
But this little missus
better learn how to cook...

01:05:52.548 --> 01:05:54.379
...so she can take care of her husband.

01:05:54.416 --> 01:05:55.542
Keep my man happy.

01:05:55.584 --> 01:05:57.313
I don't want him leaving
me for another woman.

01:05:57.353 --> 01:05:58.445
Come on...

01:05:58.487 --> 01:06:01.251
...haven't left you yet, Margaret.

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:04.157
I got it. Let go.

01:06:06.061 --> 01:06:08.495
- You all right?
- Yeah, um...

01:06:08.530 --> 01:06:10.020
You know what? I'm gonna go.

01:06:10.065 --> 01:06:11.362
Where?

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:14.301
I just kinda feel like going outside.

01:06:14.336 --> 01:06:16.861
All right. That's the bathroom.

01:06:16.905 --> 01:06:18.304
Oh, yeah. I know. I'm just, uh...

01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:21.537
I'm gonna go to go to the bathroom,
and then I'm gonna go out, outside.

01:06:21.577 --> 01:06:22.601
All right.

01:06:23.712 --> 01:06:25.179
All right.

01:06:36.158 --> 01:06:41.027
OK, you just have to focus,
Margaret. Just focus.

01:06:41.063 --> 01:06:43.827
This is a business deal.
This is just a business deal.

01:06:43.866 --> 01:06:48.633
Everything's
gonna be just fine.

01:06:49.938 --> 01:06:53.840
OK, this is a little
rough. I can do this.

01:06:55.311 --> 01:06:57.779
Oh, my God. God, I hate nature!

01:06:57.813 --> 01:06:59.144
I hate it.

01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:02.582
Not stopping. Not stopping. Oh! Oh...

01:07:02.618 --> 01:07:04.586
Why are you not stopping?

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:07.054
Stop, stop, stop it, stop!

01:07:10.693 --> 01:07:13.787
I just wanted... some air.

01:07:18.133 --> 01:07:20.624
What is that?

01:07:20.669 --> 01:07:25.333
What now? What is that? What is that?

01:07:25.374 --> 01:07:27.808
What is that?

01:07:40.522 --> 01:07:42.683
What is that?

01:07:59.041 --> 01:08:02.238
Come to me,
Margaret of New York.

01:08:02.277 --> 01:08:04.745
It is I, Grandma Annie.

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:06.145
Oh!

01:08:06.181 --> 01:08:08.672
I see you are a curious one.

01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:11.709
Come. See how I give
thanks to Mother Earth.

01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:14.154
You know, actually,
I'm not that curious.

01:08:14.189 --> 01:08:16.054
- I'll just...
- Look around you.

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:18.616
Mother Earth has provided all this...

01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:23.096
...just as she brought you and
Andrew together to be joined.

01:08:23.131 --> 01:08:25.760
- Oh.
- We must give thanks

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:28.997
and ask that your loins
be abundantly fertile.

01:08:29.037 --> 01:08:32.495
Come. Dance with me in celebration.

01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:35.874
You know, can I, can I
just thank her from here?

01:08:35.911 --> 01:08:37.776
I insist!

01:08:37.813 --> 01:08:40.111
OK, OK, OK.

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:42.912
I will come down and dance with you.

01:08:44.752 --> 01:08:47.916
Follow and learn.

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:55.890
Come on, Margaret! Feel the
rhythm of the drums. Now you.

01:08:55.930 --> 01:08:57.455
- Me what?
- Chant.

01:08:57.499 --> 01:08:59.057
Chant what?

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:01.228
Whatever comes
to you. It is the way.

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:05.036
- But I don't know any chants.
- To the trees. Use your vowels.

01:09:05.073 --> 01:09:08.839
- Eee. Ooo. Ooo. Eee.
- Ooo. Eee.

01:09:08.877 --> 01:09:10.640
- Yes. Chant.
- Yes. Chant, chant.

01:09:10.679 --> 01:09:12.805
- Eee. To the trees.
- Yes! Yes!

01:09:12.848 --> 01:09:16.875
- To the universe!
- The universe. Ah. Universe.

01:09:16.919 --> 01:09:20.685
To the crazy.
To the window, the window.

01:09:20.721 --> 01:09:22.383
To the wall, to the wall.

01:09:22.424 --> 01:09:24.118
To the sweat drip down my balls.

01:09:24.158 --> 01:09:26.593
- To all you bitches...
- Louder!

01:09:26.627 --> 01:09:28.562
To the window, to the window.

01:09:28.596 --> 01:09:30.326
To the walls, to the walls.

01:09:30.365 --> 01:09:31.957
To the sweat drip down my balls.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.264
Now all you bitches crawl.

01:09:34.303 --> 01:09:35.964
<i># All skeet, skeet, mother</i>

01:09:36.004 --> 01:09:37.595

Gammy! Let's take it

<i># You scared, you scared</i>

01:10:21.083 --> 01:10:22.550
Oh, uh.

01:10:22.584 --> 01:10:26.884
Uh... You know,
your Gammy wanted me to...

01:10:26.922 --> 01:10:28.822
...you know, chant.
Chant from the heart.

01:10:28.857 --> 01:10:31.348
Balls? That's what came to your heart?

01:10:31.393 --> 01:10:35.124
You know, it went with the beat.

01:10:35.163 --> 01:10:36.926
Your phone arrived.

01:10:36.965 --> 01:10:38.523
I'm gonna go into town
to pick it up. Wanna come?

01:10:38.567 --> 01:10:41.468
Oh, yes, I want to go.
I want to go. Oh, hold on.

01:10:41.503 --> 01:10:44.404
Is it, uh, OK if I go with him?

01:10:44.439 --> 01:10:47.067
Whatever you do is what shall be.

01:10:48.076 --> 01:10:49.236
But you're OK if I go?

01:10:49.278 --> 01:10:52.736
- Fine. Go on.
- Bye, Gammy.

01:10:52.781 --> 01:10:55.272
- You're a freak!
- Shut up.

01:10:55.317 --> 01:10:57.785
Would you, please?

01:10:58.353 --> 01:10:59.377
Ow!

01:11:17.573 --> 01:11:18.665
Hey, buddy.

01:11:18.707 --> 01:11:20.436
Andrew, hey!

01:11:20.475 --> 01:11:23.444
- You got that phone I ordered?
- Yes, it came in. How are you?

01:11:23.478 --> 01:11:25.378
- Great. You?
- Good.

01:11:27.282 --> 01:11:28.772
<i>Hola.</i>

01:11:29.651 --> 01:11:32.211
Hey, hi.

01:11:32.254 --> 01:11:33.881
Remember this?

01:11:33.922 --> 01:11:35.014
Yes, yes.

01:11:35.057 --> 01:11:37.617
Wonderful. Wonderful. Yes.

01:11:37.659 --> 01:11:40.628
- Remember that?
- Yes. Yes. I know.

01:11:43.799 --> 01:11:45.824
Think you made quite
an impression on Ramone.

01:11:45.867 --> 01:11:48.233
Mmm-hmm, I think the part
where I burst into tears

01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:49.897
just really brought us together.

01:11:49.938 --> 01:11:51.405
- Yeah. Oh, guess what.
- What?

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:52.873
Fun fact about Andrew number 11:

01:11:52.908 --> 01:11:54.432
- I like Pringles.
- Mm-hmm. OK.

01:11:54.476 --> 01:11:55.841
They're delicious. All Hostess products.

01:11:55.877 --> 01:11:57.538
Coke, never Pepsi, and beef jerky.

01:11:57.579 --> 01:11:58.841
What, are you, like, 13?

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:00.472
- Mmm.
- Here we go.

01:12:00.515 --> 01:12:01.743
It's all charged up, Andrew.

01:12:01.783 --> 01:12:02.807
Thanks, buddy.

01:12:04.653 --> 01:12:06.985
And I put your lady's number in, too.

01:12:07.022 --> 01:12:08.512
- Thank you very mu...
- Milady.

01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:13.851
Thank you, thank you very much.
Thank you.

01:12:13.895 --> 01:12:15.260
Just... thank you.

01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:22.095
Oh, my God. I have 37 messages.

01:12:23.105 --> 01:12:24.470
Shit. I need a computer.

01:12:24.506 --> 01:12:26.337
Is there, is there a computer
in this godforsaken town?

01:12:29.945 --> 01:12:33.176
OK. So when it runs out,
it gives you a warning.

01:12:33.215 --> 01:12:34.546
Just put in more dimes.

01:12:35.951 --> 01:12:37.782
- Here you go.
- What?

01:12:37.819 --> 01:12:39.753
- You're kidding. Dimes?
- Come on, Kels.

01:12:39.788 --> 01:12:41.255
- You're not kidding?
- I'll be outside.

01:12:41.289 --> 01:12:42.620
- Yell if you need me.
- But what am I supposed...

01:12:42.658 --> 01:12:44.319
You'll be fine.

01:12:46.428 --> 01:12:50.455
OK, I can figure this out.
I'm an intelligent woman.

01:12:50.499 --> 01:12:52.933
Block 'em out, block 'em out,
block 'em out. There you go.

01:12:52.968 --> 01:12:54.663
OK.

01:12:54.703 --> 01:12:56.933
Now.

01:12:56.972 --> 01:12:58.462
What is that? What is it?

01:13:02.144 --> 01:13:05.170
Um, uh, excuse me? Excuse...

01:13:08.884 --> 01:13:10.010
OK.

01:13:12.854 --> 01:13:14.879
OK.

01:13:42.651 --> 01:13:45.313
So, it was nice
to see Gertrude, huh?

01:13:45.353 --> 01:13:46.820
Yeah.

01:13:46.855 --> 01:13:49.050
She looked really pretty today.

01:13:50.459 --> 01:13:52.324
- Yeah, she did.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:13:53.595 --> 01:13:56.587
Must be nice to see each other
again and just catch up.

01:13:56.631 --> 01:13:58.758
It's definitely good to see her. It's...

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.631
...definitely, yeah.
It's been a long time.

01:14:02.437 --> 01:14:04.905
Oh, there they are.
There they are. Margaret!

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:06.271
Woo!

01:14:06.308 --> 01:14:07.400
We need Margaret.

01:14:07.442 --> 01:14:10.002
Afraid we're going to have to
steal you away, young lady.

01:14:10.045 --> 01:14:11.569
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm just gonna keep...

01:14:11.613 --> 01:14:13.308
No, not to worry.

01:14:13.348 --> 01:14:15.680
No strippers, no chanting
in the woods. Promise.

01:14:15.717 --> 01:14:17.582
- Oh, well...
- Yeah. Come on.

01:14:17.619 --> 01:14:21.453
But not you. It's girl stuff.
You'd hate it.

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:24.050
- But...
- Come on.

01:14:24.092 --> 01:14:25.684
Um, OK. Will I, uh...

01:14:25.727 --> 01:14:27.957
...are these shoes OK
for what we're gonna do?

01:14:29.331 --> 01:14:31.265
I can't believe this is happening.

01:14:32.334 --> 01:14:34.894
My mother made this dress by hand.

01:14:34.936 --> 01:14:38.702
In this very shop. In 1929.

01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:41.732
It's funny how things
come back in style.

01:14:41.777 --> 01:14:43.768
Just... just
finishing up the buttons.

01:14:43.812 --> 01:14:45.541
Yeah, and don't worry about the fit

01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:48.606
because Annie is the best
tailor in southeast Alaska.

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:49.674
Oh... Pssh.

01:14:52.087 --> 01:14:53.611
Wow, incredible.

01:14:53.655 --> 01:14:56.215
Maybe a tad loose in certain
areas, but otherwise...

01:14:56.258 --> 01:14:59.989
Oh, sorry. I'm a bit
chesty to begin with

01:15:00.028 --> 01:15:02.724
and I happened to be
knocked up when I wore this.

01:15:02.764 --> 01:15:04.095
Oh.

01:15:04.132 --> 01:15:07.431
Oh, let's see if we can find your boobs.

01:15:09.504 --> 01:15:12.598
- They're in there somewhere.
- Yes. Yes, they are.

01:15:12.641 --> 01:15:14.472
This is like an Easter egg hunt.

01:15:15.644 --> 01:15:18.135
Maybe they shrunk up
in the cold Alaskan air.

01:15:21.116 --> 01:15:25.018
- Oh! There they are.
- That... yes. That would be...

01:15:25.053 --> 01:15:28.580
- There, let's see.
- I was thinking, if you'd like,

01:15:28.623 --> 01:15:33.356
maybe we could head down your
way for the holidays this year.

01:15:33.395 --> 01:15:35.590
Oh, that would, uh...
that would be nice.

01:15:35.630 --> 01:15:40.124
That'd be nice. Or maybe
we could come to you, too.

01:15:40.168 --> 01:15:43.899
- Well, that would be lovely.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:15:43.939 --> 01:15:46.100
I would like that very much.

01:15:46.141 --> 01:15:48.939
Oh, Grace, for God's sake.
We've got work to do.

01:15:48.977 --> 01:15:51.775
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Go make yourself a cup of tea.

01:15:51.813 --> 01:15:54.646
I'll finish this. Go.

01:15:54.683 --> 01:16:00.622
Now, let's make this
absolute perfection.

01:16:02.824 --> 01:16:08.319
Now, just one special touch
and you're ready.

01:16:12.067 --> 01:16:16.868
It's been in the family
for more than 150 years.

01:16:16.905 --> 01:16:18.873
Annie, it's beautiful,
but I don't really think...

01:16:18.907 --> 01:16:21.569
- Shh. I'm not finished.
- Oh, sorry.

01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:25.102
My great-grandfather gave it
to my great-grandmother

01:16:25.146 --> 01:16:27.307
when they got married.

01:16:27.349 --> 01:16:29.408
They were quite a scandal, you know.

01:16:29.451 --> 01:16:33.410
He was Russian and she
was Tlingit, and back then

01:16:33.455 --> 01:16:36.253
you had to get approval
from every member of the tribe

01:16:36.291 --> 01:16:37.622
before you got married.

01:16:37.659 --> 01:16:39.217
Almost broke them up.

01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:42.196
Well... how did they stay together then?

01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:44.926
She was a lot like you. Tough.

01:16:44.966 --> 01:16:47.901
Wouldn't take "no" for an answer.

01:16:47.936 --> 01:16:51.804
She was good for him.

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.603
I want you to have it.

01:16:53.642 --> 01:16:57.134
- I can't. Can't take this.
- I don't want to hear it.

01:16:57.178 --> 01:17:00.807
Grandmothers love to give
their stuff to their grandchildren.

01:17:00.849 --> 01:17:03.579
It makes us feel like we'll
still be part of your lives

01:17:03.618 --> 01:17:05.017
even after we're gone.

01:17:05.053 --> 01:17:07.248
Take it.

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:15.927
Are... are you all right, dear?

01:17:17.265 --> 01:17:19.927
I, uh...

01:17:21.469 --> 01:17:24.404
Uh... Well, I, um...

01:17:26.574 --> 01:17:32.308
I, uh... I just, uh, I just wanted to...

01:17:32.347 --> 01:17:35.111
make sure there was enough time
to get all the sewing done.

01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:38.119
Don't you worry about that.

01:17:38.153 --> 01:17:40.621
- You're gonna be beautiful.
- OK.

01:17:40.655 --> 01:17:44.250
- Now let's get you out of those pins.
- OK.

01:18:07.382 --> 01:18:08.508
All right.

01:18:13.588 --> 01:18:18.025
This is untied. Hop on in.

01:18:20.395 --> 01:18:22.795
Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:18:23.498 --> 01:18:24.897
Whoa! What...

01:18:24.933 --> 01:18:26.491
Mind telling me what the hell's wrong?

01:18:26.534 --> 01:18:28.229
I just needed to get
away from everybody.

01:18:28.269 --> 01:18:30.294
- What's wrong?
- Nothing! Just stop talking, please!

01:18:38.747 --> 01:18:42.308
Would you mind telling me
what's happening now?

01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:43.817
Margaret.

01:18:46.454 --> 01:18:48.979
- Margaret!
- I forgot, OK?

01:18:49.024 --> 01:18:50.218
You forgot what?

01:18:50.258 --> 01:18:52.818
I forgot what it was
like to have a family!

01:18:52.861 --> 01:18:55.227
I've been on my own since I was 16

01:18:55.263 --> 01:18:58.198
and I forgot what it felt
like to have people love you

01:18:58.233 --> 01:19:00.497
and make you breakfast and say, "Hey!

01:19:00.535 --> 01:19:02.127
We'd love to come down
for the holidays."

01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:05.662
And I say, "Well, why don't we
come up and see you instead?"

01:19:05.707 --> 01:19:08.198
And give you necklaces!
And you have all that here,

01:19:08.243 --> 01:19:10.905
and you have Gertrude, and
I'm... I'm just screwing it up!

01:19:10.945 --> 01:19:13.175
You're not screwing it up!
I agreed to this!

01:19:13.214 --> 01:19:14.272
You were there, remember?

01:19:14.315 --> 01:19:15.873
Your family loves you. Do you know that?

01:19:15.917 --> 01:19:17.475
- I know that! Yes!
- You know that?

01:19:17.519 --> 01:19:19.180
And you're still willing
to put them through this?

01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:20.244
They're not gonna find out!

01:19:20.288 --> 01:19:21.585
How do you know they won't find out?

01:19:21.623 --> 01:19:22.954
Because you said so yourself.

01:19:22.991 --> 01:19:24.959
- I know, but what if your mother...
- You said so yourself!

01:19:24.993 --> 01:19:26.187
Oh, my God, if your mother found out...

01:19:26.227 --> 01:19:28.252
Whoa! Whoa!

01:19:28.296 --> 01:19:29.923
- Oh, my God! What if Gammy finds out?
- The boat is moving!

01:19:29.964 --> 01:19:31.397
If Gammy finds out, she's
gonna have a heart attack!

01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:33.367
Stop! It's gonna be fine!

01:19:33.401 --> 01:19:35.631
- She's gonna have a heart attack!
- Will you calm down! Hold on!

01:19:36.571 --> 01:19:38.095
Whoa, whoa. Whoa!

01:19:38.139 --> 01:19:41.768
Whoa! I don't think
that hijacking a boat

01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:45.405
is a proper way to
express your frustration!

01:19:45.447 --> 01:19:46.812
Now... Oh, great.

01:19:46.848 --> 01:19:49.180
Now you decide to shut up! Margaret?

01:19:49.217 --> 01:19:51.276
- Andrew!
- Margaret?

01:19:51.319 --> 01:19:53.981
- Andrew!
- Margaret!

01:19:57.792 --> 01:19:58.850
I can't swim!

01:19:58.893 --> 01:20:00.417
Margaret!

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:01.724
To the buoy!

01:20:01.763 --> 01:20:04.231
- What?
- To the buoy!

01:20:05.133 --> 01:20:06.157
OK.

01:20:19.447 --> 01:20:21.813
All right, come on! Give me your hand!

01:20:21.850 --> 01:20:24.318
Hey! Give me your hand!

01:20:24.352 --> 01:20:27.048
Margaret! Give me...

01:20:27.088 --> 01:20:28.612
Come on, give me your hand!

01:20:28.656 --> 01:20:30.146
Come on, come on. I got you. I got you.

01:20:31.192 --> 01:20:32.682
I got you.

01:20:33.928 --> 01:20:36.328
Come on.

01:20:36.364 --> 01:20:38.195
What the hell
were you thinking?

01:20:38.233 --> 01:20:39.894
Could've gotten yourself killed.

01:20:39.934 --> 01:20:43.335
You turned the boat and
made me fall in, you jackass.

01:20:43.371 --> 01:20:45.396
You let go of the steering wheel, Ahab.

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:48.068
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:20:48.109 --> 01:20:51.408
All right, come here.
You've got to get warm. Come on.

01:20:51.446 --> 01:20:56.008
Come on. It's OK.

01:20:56.050 --> 01:20:57.210
That's OK.

01:21:00.622 --> 01:21:01.850
It's OK.

01:21:33.922 --> 01:21:35.412
I want to talk to both of you.

01:21:48.503 --> 01:21:51.131
Your mother is never to
hear about any of this.

01:22:03.451 --> 01:22:05.442
Told you I'd check up on you.

01:22:06.955 --> 01:22:08.183
What did you do?

01:22:08.223 --> 01:22:10.123
I got a phone call from
Mr. Gilbertson here,

01:22:10.158 --> 01:22:12.422
who told me that if you were lying,

01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:14.690
and he strongly believes that you are,

01:22:14.729 --> 01:22:16.253
he would send you to prison.

01:22:16.297 --> 01:22:18.390
So I flew him up here.

01:22:18.433 --> 01:22:20.458
- Dad.
- Luckily for you,

01:22:20.501 --> 01:22:23.527
your father negotiated
a deal on your behalf.

01:22:23.571 --> 01:22:26.802
Now, this offer's
gonna last for 20 seconds,

01:22:26.841 --> 01:22:28.570
so listen closely.

01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:29.702
You're gonna make a statement

01:22:29.744 --> 01:22:31.405
admitting this marriage is a sham...

01:22:31.446 --> 01:22:32.743
...or you're gonna go to prison.

01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:35.010
You tell the truth, you're off the hook,

01:22:35.049 --> 01:22:37.813
and she is going to go back to Canada.

01:22:43.224 --> 01:22:46.022
Ah, well. Take the deal.

01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:50.463
- I don't think so.
- Don't be stupid, Andrew.

01:22:50.498 --> 01:22:52.295
You want a statement?
Here's your statement.

01:22:52.333 --> 01:22:53.994
I've been working for
Margaret Tate for three years.

01:22:54.035 --> 01:22:56.333
Six months ago we started
dating, we fell in love.

01:22:56.371 --> 01:22:58.236
I asked her to marry me, she said "yes."

01:22:58.273 --> 01:23:00.468
I'll see you at the wedding.

01:23:11.152 --> 01:23:12.744
Well, you know.

01:23:34.075 --> 01:23:38.034
So...

01:23:38.079 --> 01:23:40.741
...you sure about this?

01:23:40.782 --> 01:23:42.340
Not really.

01:23:46.054 --> 01:23:48.887
I mean, I am very appreciative
of what you've done,

01:23:48.923 --> 01:23:49.947
but I think that...

01:23:49.991 --> 01:23:51.185
You'd do the same for me.

01:23:51.225 --> 01:23:52.852
Right?

01:23:54.262 --> 01:23:56.594
Hope everyone is decent.

01:23:56.631 --> 01:23:58.121
You need to come with me.

01:23:58.166 --> 01:23:59.861
Now, tomorrow
is your wedding day.

01:23:59.901 --> 01:24:01.562
You have to give the
Baby Maker a rest tonight.

01:24:01.602 --> 01:24:03.365
It's tradition.

01:24:03.404 --> 01:24:05.395
- Give your bride a kiss good night.
- We're not gonna...

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:06.668
...use the Baby Maker.

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:08.437
You've got your whole
lives to be together.

01:24:08.476 --> 01:24:11.274
- OK.
- Now, come on. Come on.

01:24:18.586 --> 01:24:19.780
If I don't go with her,
she's just gonna...

01:24:19.821 --> 01:24:23.723
- Come right back.
- Yeah.

01:24:30.698 --> 01:24:32.063
See you in the morning?

01:24:33.134 --> 01:24:34.533
Yeah.

01:25:37.565 --> 01:25:38.657
Hey, Gammy.

01:25:40.468 --> 01:25:42.231
- Thanks, Gammy.
- Oh.

01:26:51.906 --> 01:26:53.396
Everyone, please be seated.

01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:00.404
Ramone.

01:27:04.352 --> 01:27:09.085
We are gathered here
today to give thanks...

01:27:10.057 --> 01:27:12.685
...and to celebrate...

01:27:12.727 --> 01:27:15.287
...one of life's greatest moments.

01:27:15.329 --> 01:27:17.160
To give recognition

01:27:17.198 --> 01:27:21.965
to the beauty, honesty,
and unselfish ways

01:27:22.003 --> 01:27:24.801
of Andrew and Margaret's true love

01:27:24.839 --> 01:27:27.307
in front of family and friends.

01:27:27.341 --> 01:27:30.242
For it is their family and friends

01:27:30.278 --> 01:27:34.578
who taught Andrew and Margaret to love.

01:27:34.615 --> 01:27:39.382
So it is only right that
family and friends are all...

01:27:42.890 --> 01:27:45.120
<i>Mi amor.</i> Do you have a question?

01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:47.928
Uh, no...

01:27:47.962 --> 01:27:49.452
Your hand is up.

01:27:53.034 --> 01:27:56.060
Oh, it, it's, uh, not a question,

01:27:56.103 --> 01:27:58.367
but I do have something I need to say.

01:27:58.406 --> 01:28:02.342
- Margaret.
- Can it wait till after?

01:28:02.376 --> 01:28:06.904
Uh... No. No.

01:28:18.292 --> 01:28:22.194
- Hi there.
- Hi.

01:28:22.229 --> 01:28:24.390
Thank you all so much for coming out.

01:28:24.432 --> 01:28:27.595
I, uh... have
a bit of an announcement

01:28:27.635 --> 01:28:29.762
to make about the wedding.

01:28:29.804 --> 01:28:33.103
- A confession, actually.
- What are you doing?

01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:36.701
Uh... I'm a Canadian. Yes, Canadian.

01:28:36.744 --> 01:28:40.908
With an expired visa
who was about to be deported.

01:28:40.948 --> 01:28:42.609
And because I didn't want to leave

01:28:42.650 --> 01:28:44.880
this wonderful country of yours,

01:28:44.919 --> 01:28:47.854
I forced Andrew here to marry me.

01:28:47.888 --> 01:28:49.321
Margaret, stop it.

01:28:49.357 --> 01:28:53.225
See, Andrew has always had
this extraordinary work ethic.

01:28:54.695 --> 01:28:56.356
Something I think he learned from you.

01:28:57.665 --> 01:28:59.724
And for three years I
watched him work harder

01:28:59.767 --> 01:29:01.735
than anyone else at our company.

01:29:01.769 --> 01:29:05.034
And I knew that if I threatened
to destroy his career...

01:29:05.072 --> 01:29:08.269
...he would, he would do
just about anything.

01:29:11.846 --> 01:29:15.873
So I blackmailed him to
come up here and to lie to you.

01:29:18.019 --> 01:29:21.045
All of you.

01:29:21.088 --> 01:29:23.818
And I thought it would
be easy to watch him do it.

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:27.518
But it wasn't.

01:29:30.398 --> 01:29:32.559
Turns out it's not easy
to ruin someone's life

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:35.228
once you find out
how wonderful they are.

01:29:41.475 --> 01:29:43.500
You have a beautiful family.

01:29:45.346 --> 01:29:47.473
Don't let this
come between you.

01:29:50.518 --> 01:29:52.816
This was my fault.

01:29:52.853 --> 01:29:54.684
Margaret...

01:29:54.722 --> 01:29:56.622
Andrew, this was a business deal,

01:29:56.657 --> 01:30:00.684
and you held up your end,
but now the deal is off.

01:30:01.962 --> 01:30:03.259
I'm sorry.

01:30:05.166 --> 01:30:06.394
And, you, meet me at the dock.

01:30:06.434 --> 01:30:08.231
You're giving me a ride to the airport.

01:30:25.052 --> 01:30:27.543
- What were you thinking?
- I don't, I don't know.

01:30:27.588 --> 01:30:29.180
Andrew, you lied to us.

01:30:29.223 --> 01:30:30.622
Let me get my head on straight, OK?

01:30:30.658 --> 01:30:32.057
I'll explain everything later.

01:30:32.093 --> 01:30:34.425
I'm sorry.

01:31:11.832 --> 01:31:14.699
<i> You were right.</i>
<i>This book is special.</i>

01:31:14.735 --> 01:31:16.362
<i>I lied because I knew publishing meant</i>

01:31:16.403 --> 01:31:17.665
<i>I'd lose you as an assistant</i>

01:31:17.705 --> 01:31:19.935
<i>but... you have an extraordinary eye,</i>

01:31:19.974 --> 01:31:23.000
<i>and I'll make sure we</i>
<i>buy this before I leave.</i>

01:31:23.043 --> 01:31:27.173
<i>Have an amazing life.</i>
<i>You deserve it. Margaret.</i>

01:31:29.416 --> 01:31:32.647
Well, that was, uh... crazy.

01:31:34.054 --> 01:31:36.488
You know, people are gonna be
talking about this forever.

01:31:38.392 --> 01:31:40.019
Yeah. Yeah.

01:31:41.729 --> 01:31:42.855
Are you OK?

01:31:44.098 --> 01:31:46.965
Yeah. No. Uh...

01:31:49.136 --> 01:31:53.004
I just feel... You know
what the problem is?

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:56.237
The problem is that this woman...

01:31:56.277 --> 01:31:59.804
...is a gigantic pain in my ass.

01:31:59.847 --> 01:32:02.315
First there's the whole leaving
thing. I understand that.

01:32:02.349 --> 01:32:05.147
It's a sham wedding.
It's kind of stressful.

01:32:05.186 --> 01:32:08.212
But then she goes ahead
and she leaves this note.

01:32:08.255 --> 01:32:10.120
Because she doesn't have the decency...

01:32:10.157 --> 01:32:12.284
the humanity to do it to my face.

01:32:12.326 --> 01:32:17.423
Three years. Three years
I work with this... this terrorist.

01:32:17.464 --> 01:32:19.056
Never once has she had
a nice thing to say,

01:32:19.099 --> 01:32:20.964
and then she goes ahead
and she writes this crap!

01:32:21.001 --> 01:32:22.764
- Andrew.
- But none of that matters

01:32:22.803 --> 01:32:24.031
because we had a deal!

01:32:24.071 --> 01:32:28.269
- Andrew.
- Sorry. I'm sorry. I just...

01:32:28.309 --> 01:32:29.503
She just makes me a little crazy.

01:32:29.543 --> 01:32:32.979
Yeah. I can see that.

01:32:33.013 --> 01:32:37.074
So you're just gonna let her go?

01:32:50.364 --> 01:32:52.332
So, what now?

01:32:52.366 --> 01:32:55.335
Well... now that
you're leaving voluntarily,

01:32:55.369 --> 01:32:58.065
it all becomes very civilized.

01:32:58.105 --> 01:33:00.869
Once we land in New York,
you have 24 hours

01:33:00.908 --> 01:33:03.934
to head back to Canada.

01:33:11.318 --> 01:33:13.650
- Andrew, what's happening?
- I got to talk to her.

01:33:13.687 --> 01:33:14.915
- Why would you do that?
- Boys!

01:33:14.955 --> 01:33:15.979
This has nothing to do with you.

01:33:16.023 --> 01:33:17.047
Boys, stop it! Stop it!

01:33:17.091 --> 01:33:18.581
I'm not gonna let you do this.

01:33:18.626 --> 01:33:20.093
I'm not asking
your permission here.

01:33:20.127 --> 01:33:23.324
Annie! Joe! Joe!

01:33:23.364 --> 01:33:26.561
Annie! Joe!

01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:29.592
I think I'm having a heart attack.

01:33:29.637 --> 01:33:31.070
- Easy. Easy.
- Somebody get a doctor!

01:33:31.105 --> 01:33:32.936
- Easy, easy.
- Get a doctor!

01:33:36.977 --> 01:33:38.069
I got it.

01:34:06.607 --> 01:34:08.336
Andrew.

01:34:10.911 --> 01:34:14.312
You two need to stop fighting.

01:34:14.348 --> 01:34:17.010
You'll never see eye to eye.

01:34:18.319 --> 01:34:21.948
But you're family.

01:34:25.292 --> 01:34:30.229
Promise me you'll stand by Andrew.

01:34:30.264 --> 01:34:33.131
Even if... if you don't agree with him.

01:34:35.502 --> 01:34:36.867
I promise.

01:34:38.806 --> 01:34:41.240
Andrew.

01:34:41.275 --> 01:34:47.236
Promise me you'll work harder
to be a part of this family.

01:34:47.281 --> 01:34:49.306
I will.

01:34:51.952 --> 01:34:54.284
I will, Gammy.

01:34:54.321 --> 01:34:59.953
Well, then, the spirits can take me.

01:34:59.994 --> 01:35:01.757
Oh, Annie.

01:35:08.502 --> 01:35:10.163
Gammy?

01:35:16.643 --> 01:35:18.372
I guess they're not ready for me.

01:35:19.613 --> 01:35:21.444
I'm feeling much better, sonny.

01:35:21.482 --> 01:35:23.382
No need to take us
to the hospital.

01:35:23.417 --> 01:35:25.214
Take us to the airport, please.

01:35:25.252 --> 01:35:27.083
Mom, what? Are you faking
the heart attack?

01:35:27.121 --> 01:35:28.554
Oh, come on!

01:35:28.589 --> 01:35:30.420
Well, it was the only
way I could get you two

01:35:30.457 --> 01:35:32.857
to shut up and get us to the airport!

01:35:32.893 --> 01:35:34.952
Ma'am, we're not authorized
to take you to the airport.

01:35:34.995 --> 01:35:37.964
Larry Ferris, don't
make me call your mother.

01:35:37.998 --> 01:35:40.159
You got it.

01:35:41.735 --> 01:35:44.033
You scared the hell out of me.

01:35:49.143 --> 01:35:53.204
Yep. You should've
given up back in New York.

01:35:53.247 --> 01:35:56.478
See, I'm like Eliot Ness.

01:35:56.517 --> 01:35:59.611
I always get my man.

01:35:59.653 --> 01:36:02.679
I'm that good.

01:36:02.723 --> 01:36:04.850
Flight 1601, as soon
as you're in position,

01:36:04.892 --> 01:36:06.189
you're cleared for takeoff.

01:36:06.226 --> 01:36:07.352
<i> Roger that, Chuck.</i>

01:36:15.402 --> 01:36:17.302
OK. Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:25.068
Tower. Talk to me.

01:36:25.112 --> 01:36:27.205
- Chuck! It's Drew Paxton.
- <i>Hey, dude.</i>

01:36:27.247 --> 01:36:30.239
Hey, uh... I have a little
favor I need from you, buddy...

01:36:30.284 --> 01:36:32.343
Margaret's on that plane. I got
to talk to her. Can you stop it?

01:36:32.386 --> 01:36:33.683
<i> Oh, yeah!</i>

01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:35.483
I heard about your lady bailin'.

01:36:35.522 --> 01:36:38.548
- Drag-ola.
- <i> Chuck! I need you</i>

01:36:38.592 --> 01:36:40.116
to stop the plane. Please.

01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:43.027
<i>I can't do that. </i>

01:36:43.063 --> 01:36:46.396
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no! Come on!

01:36:47.201 --> 01:36:48.600
Oh, no.

01:36:50.771 --> 01:36:52.466
No!

01:36:54.241 --> 01:36:56.141
- What's wrong?
- Margaret's on that plane.

01:36:56.176 --> 01:36:58.440
- And he didn't get to tell her.
- Tell her what?

01:36:58.479 --> 01:36:59.946
That he loves her.

01:36:59.980 --> 01:37:02.813
So she could tell him
that she loves him, too.

01:37:02.850 --> 01:37:04.010
OK, but how does he...

01:37:04.051 --> 01:37:05.416
If she didn't love him,
she wouldn't have left.

01:37:05.452 --> 01:37:06.942
Of course not.

01:37:06.987 --> 01:37:08.511
Am I the only one not getting this?

01:37:08.555 --> 01:37:12.423
- Oh, Joe!
- Chuck! Chuck! Look down.

01:37:12.459 --> 01:37:13.926
Oh! Oh. Look down.

01:37:13.961 --> 01:37:16.259
<i>Like... Oh, there you are!</i>

01:37:16.296 --> 01:37:18.423
<i>Sorry, man. There was</i>
<i>nothing I could do.</i>

01:37:20.434 --> 01:37:22.095
Thanks, Chuck.

01:37:25.172 --> 01:37:29.438
I'm sorry, son. I didn't
know how you felt about her.

01:37:34.648 --> 01:37:36.240
Honey, it's gonna be OK.

01:38:09.716 --> 01:38:11.183
Jordan?

01:38:29.503 --> 01:38:30.527
Jordan.

01:38:31.905 --> 01:38:33.372
Jordan!

01:38:33.407 --> 01:38:36.740
I need for you to send
the boxes in my office to...

01:38:36.777 --> 01:38:38.369
...to this address, please.

01:38:38.412 --> 01:38:42.746
This one right here.
This address right here. OK?

01:38:42.783 --> 01:38:45.343
- Can you do that?
- Uh, yes. Sure.

01:38:45.385 --> 01:38:47.250
- Good, all right. Thank you.
- Miss Tate.

01:38:47.287 --> 01:38:50.484
Yes. What? What?

01:38:52.359 --> 01:38:55.726
Hey.

01:38:57.097 --> 01:38:59.725
Andrew.

01:39:03.537 --> 01:39:06.165
Why are, why are you panting?

01:39:06.206 --> 01:39:08.367
Because I've been running.

01:39:08.408 --> 01:39:11.241
- Really. From Alaska?
- I need to talk to you.

01:39:11.278 --> 01:39:12.973
Yeah? Well, I don't have time to talk.

01:39:13.013 --> 01:39:15.413
I need to catch a 5:45 to Toronto.

01:39:15.449 --> 01:39:17.144
- Margaret.
- I need the boxes to go out today.

01:39:17.184 --> 01:39:18.242
I want to make sure everything is...

01:39:18.285 --> 01:39:20.378
Margaret! Stop talking!

01:39:24.491 --> 01:39:25.981
Gotta say something.

01:39:26.026 --> 01:39:27.721
- OK.
- This will just take a sec.

01:39:27.761 --> 01:39:29.661
Fine. What?

01:39:30.664 --> 01:39:35.397
Three days ago, I loathed you.

01:39:35.435 --> 01:39:37.630
I used to dream about you
getting hit by a cab.

01:39:37.671 --> 01:39:38.968
Or poisoned.

01:39:39.006 --> 01:39:42.601
- Oh, that's nice.
- I told you to stop talking.

01:39:42.643 --> 01:39:45.237
Then we had our little
adventure up in Alaska

01:39:45.279 --> 01:39:47.645
and things started to change.

01:39:47.681 --> 01:39:50.343
Things changed when we kissed.

01:39:52.319 --> 01:39:54.253
And when you told me about your tattoo.

01:39:56.890 --> 01:39:59.085
Even when you checked me
out when we were naked.

01:39:59.126 --> 01:40:00.491
Uh-huuuh.

01:40:00.527 --> 01:40:01.653
Naked?

01:40:01.695 --> 01:40:03.663
Well, I didn't see anything...

01:40:03.697 --> 01:40:05.062
Yeah, you did.

01:40:05.098 --> 01:40:09.364
But I didn't realize any of
this until I was standing alone.

01:40:09.403 --> 01:40:13.203
In a barn... wife-less.

01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:15.868
Now, you can imagine my disappointment

01:40:15.909 --> 01:40:17.376
when it suddenly dawned on me

01:40:17.411 --> 01:40:21.711
that the woman I love is about
to be kicked out of the country.

01:40:24.318 --> 01:40:26.149
So, Margaret.

01:40:28.388 --> 01:40:29.514
Marry me.

01:40:32.959 --> 01:40:35.450
Because I'd like to date you.

01:40:47.674 --> 01:40:51.007
Trust me. You don't really
want to be with me.

01:40:51.044 --> 01:40:52.773
Yes, I do.

01:40:54.414 --> 01:40:57.406
See, the thing is, there is a reason why

01:40:57.451 --> 01:41:00.045
I've been alone all this time.

01:41:00.087 --> 01:41:02.055
I'm comfortable that way.

01:41:02.089 --> 01:41:04.114
And I think it would
just be a lot easier

01:41:04.157 --> 01:41:10.187
if we forgot everything
that happened and I just left.

01:41:12.065 --> 01:41:13.657
You're right.

01:41:19.172 --> 01:41:21.766
That would be easier.

01:41:37.557 --> 01:41:41.015
- I'm scared.
- Me, too.

01:42:04.885 --> 01:42:07.820
Aren't you supposed to get down
on your knee or something?

01:42:07.854 --> 01:42:09.378
I'm gonna take that as a "yes."

01:42:09.423 --> 01:42:11.448
Oh, OK.

01:42:25.972 --> 01:42:28.907
Yeah! Show her
who's boss, Andrew!

01:42:37.017 --> 01:42:40.646
So, let me see
if I've got this right.

01:42:40.687 --> 01:42:43.121
You two are engaged again.

01:42:43.156 --> 01:42:44.714
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:42:44.758 --> 01:42:46.851
For real?

01:42:47.794 --> 01:42:48.954
- Yes.
- Yeah.

01:42:48.995 --> 01:42:50.053
You're sure you want to
go through with this?

01:42:50.096 --> 01:42:51.222
Because one wrong answer...

01:42:51.264 --> 01:42:54.461
I'm gonna take you down.

01:42:56.837 --> 01:42:59.533
- OK.
- OK.

01:43:01.174 --> 01:43:02.471
Let's do it.

01:43:11.918 --> 01:43:13.442
When did you
first start to date?

01:43:13.487 --> 01:43:15.352
Last week.

01:43:15.388 --> 01:43:18.619
- That going well?
- So far it's great. Thank you.

01:43:18.658 --> 01:43:20.148
What kind of
deodorant does Andrew use?

01:43:20.193 --> 01:43:21.751
Men's Speed Stick?

01:43:21.795 --> 01:43:25.094
What flavor? Musk? Alpine?

01:43:25.131 --> 01:43:26.428
Was it love at first sight?

01:43:26.466 --> 01:43:28.593
No.

01:43:28.635 --> 01:43:32.469
I loved her from the beginning.

01:43:32.506 --> 01:43:33.768
What side of the
bed does Margaret sleep on?

01:43:33.807 --> 01:43:35.536
She sleeps on the left.

01:43:35.575 --> 01:43:37.008
What side of the bed do you sleep on?

01:43:39.045 --> 01:43:43.379
Look, are they soul mates? Eeeh.

01:43:43.416 --> 01:43:46.044
Uh... Will they kill each other? No.

01:43:46.086 --> 01:43:47.212
Are you a good driver?

01:43:47.254 --> 01:43:49.848
Oh, excellent driver. Excellent.

01:43:53.627 --> 01:43:56.027
Oh.

01:43:56.062 --> 01:43:59.054
In my mind I see her
with someone perhaps...

01:43:59.099 --> 01:44:00.999
...more swarthy, darker.

01:44:01.034 --> 01:44:03.662
We don't use the word
"Margaret" around Kevin.

01:44:03.703 --> 01:44:08.003
He still hasn't warmed up to her.

01:44:08.041 --> 01:44:09.736
Margaret.

01:44:09.776 --> 01:44:11.767
Margaret.

01:44:11.811 --> 01:44:13.540
See? It's the damnedest thing.

01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:15.207
I have never farted in front of him.

01:44:15.248 --> 01:44:17.648
Nor will I ever fart in front of him.

01:44:17.684 --> 01:44:20.209
She farts in her sleep.

01:44:20.253 --> 01:44:22.153
Would you consider
Margaret a good dancer?

01:44:22.188 --> 01:44:25.419
You can tell by the way
she drinks her soda pop

01:44:25.458 --> 01:44:27.824
that she's a good dancer.

01:44:27.861 --> 01:44:29.089
Uh-huh. How, how...

01:44:29.129 --> 01:44:33.566
How is the soda pop
relevant to the dancing?

01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:35.261
I don't understand this.

01:44:35.302 --> 01:44:38.237
- I call him... puppy.
- Pumpkin.

01:44:38.271 --> 01:44:39.932
- Monkey.
- Daisy.

01:44:39.973 --> 01:44:42.168
- Kiddo.
- Uh... Bird.

01:44:42.208 --> 01:44:45.405
Sometimes I call him Rick.

01:44:45.445 --> 01:44:46.912
How do you spell "Ramone?"

01:44:46.947 --> 01:44:49.814
R-A-M-O-N-E.

01:44:49.849 --> 01:44:51.749
Could you do that
again in English, please?

01:44:51.785 --> 01:44:54.652
When you say, you know, the
position in the relationship...

01:44:54.688 --> 01:44:56.053
Top or bottom?

01:44:56.089 --> 01:44:59.058
You're asking me a question
about who's on top?

01:44:59.092 --> 01:45:00.821
You took an oath
when you walked in this office.

01:45:00.860 --> 01:45:03.328
I did not take an oath.
When did I take an oath?

01:45:03.363 --> 01:45:04.625
Laura should've
done that, but she didn't.

01:45:04.664 --> 01:45:06.529
- That's OK.
- Who's Laura?

01:45:06.566 --> 01:45:08.898
She's the girl behind you.
Don't look around.

01:45:08.935 --> 01:45:10.197
Which of
the following numbers

01:45:10.236 --> 01:45:13.034
- is not a prime?
- Seventeen.

01:45:13.073 --> 01:45:15.234
I'm sorry. Let me say the list, please.

01:45:15.275 --> 01:45:16.299
I'm sorry?

01:45:16.343 --> 01:45:17.605
He knew
your favorite color.

01:45:17.644 --> 01:45:19.271
- Blue?
- Wrong!

01:45:19.312 --> 01:45:20.836
- Red?
- No!

01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:22.404
Dark... Maybe like a hunter green?

01:45:22.449 --> 01:45:23.848
No. White.

01:45:23.883 --> 01:45:25.145
- White?
- OK, moving on.

01:45:25.185 --> 01:45:26.584
Favorite color is blue.

01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:30.522
What's her favorite color
when she's not at home?

01:45:30.557 --> 01:45:31.956
I don't know.

01:45:31.992 --> 01:45:33.755
Are you a citizen
of this country, Ramone?

01:45:33.793 --> 01:45:37.661
Yes, I'm a citizen!
Are you crazy?

01:45:39.699 --> 01:45:42.600
What relevance a ball in a net

01:45:42.636 --> 01:45:44.570
or a Fruit Roll-Up or a Pop-Tart

01:45:44.604 --> 01:45:47.164
has to do with my
relationship with Andrew?

01:45:47.207 --> 01:45:48.731
If you're
getting excited...

01:45:48.775 --> 01:45:51.903
Who are you engaged to?

01:45:51.945 --> 01:45:56.143
- Andrew.
- Very good. Got one right.

01:45:56.182 --> 01:45:57.342
Who are you engaged to?

01:45:57.384 --> 01:45:59.079
I'm engaged to Margaret Tate.

01:45:59.119 --> 01:46:04.580
And on the wedding day,
who will be next to you?

01:46:04.624 --> 01:46:06.922
I'm going to marry Margaret Tate.

01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:09.656
- Final answer?
- That work? Yeah, final answer.

01:46:09.696 --> 01:46:12.995
Is this a game show?
I don't understand what...

01:46:20.106 --> 01:46:21.573
That's a great song.

01:46:21.608 --> 01:46:23.337
That was beautiful.
That was really beautiful.

01:46:23.376 --> 01:46:25.037
Mama Cass.

01:47:25.038 --> 01:47:26.038
