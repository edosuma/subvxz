00:04.394 --> 00:06.879
Previously on "Dead of Summer"...

00:07.634 --> 00:08.682
I got to go.

00:08.732 --> 00:09.796
What did I do? Cricket!

00:09.846 --> 00:10.797
Who are you?

00:10.847 --> 00:12.115
Look, you said you could accept me.

00:12.165 --> 00:13.949
- Blair...
- Every time I see you,

00:13.999 --> 00:14.974
you seem to be filming something.

00:15.024 --> 00:16.013
You know what they say.

00:16.062 --> 00:17.015
The camera never lies.

00:17.067 --> 00:18.442
I feel like I could talk
to you all night.

00:18.492 --> 00:20.318
Gross. She's like your mother's age.

00:20.473 --> 00:22.405
Deb might not be who she says she is.

00:22.455 --> 00:24.041
Deb is not Satanic.

00:24.153 --> 00:25.583
If she was, isn't Cricket right?

00:25.633 --> 00:26.703
Wouldn't she hide it?

00:26.753 --> 00:28.653
But I do know
something is going on here.

00:28.703 --> 00:30.521
You ever think it's possible...

00:30.571 --> 00:32.590
that some of it could be real?

00:32.640 --> 00:35.594
The Tall Man has said,
"It's only just begun."

00:43.673 --> 00:45.268
Do you expect me to talk?

00:45.318 --> 00:46.554
No, Mr. Bond.

00:46.604 --> 00:48.384
I expect you to die.

00:49.568 --> 00:51.274
Oh, check it out, Joel!

00:52.203 --> 00:55.174
Do you think I
could pass as 007 at prom?

00:55.753 --> 00:56.770
Maybe...

00:56.820 --> 00:58.405
If everyone there was blind.

00:58.455 --> 01:00.252
Oh, okay.

01:02.800 --> 01:03.978
You know, I'm gonna miss you, brother.

01:04.028 --> 01:06.072
A few more weeks,
you'll be off at camp, man.

01:06.122 --> 01:07.888
I wish you could come with me.

01:08.324 --> 01:10.275
Nah, I've had my own experience
with Stillwater.

01:10.325 --> 01:11.409
You got to experience it for yourself.

01:11.459 --> 01:15.260
As the geeky kid that nobody
can believe is related to you?

01:18.804 --> 01:20.763
Let's see them call you geeky in that.

01:22.689 --> 01:24.486
I could fit four of me in this.

01:24.536 --> 01:25.633
It depends how you wear it.

01:25.683 --> 01:28.392
Perception beats reality every time.

01:30.377 --> 01:32.778
I can't believe you're giving
me your favorite shirt.

01:32.828 --> 01:35.172
Just thank me when you win
your first Oscar, okay?

01:35.222 --> 01:37.386
Deal.
- My man.

01:48.490 --> 01:50.226
What's wrong, Michael?

01:50.276 --> 01:52.867
Did you... see something?

01:52.977 --> 01:55.202
Uh, I-I see a kid who's
gonna make me late for prom, man.

01:55.252 --> 01:56.458
Come on, I got to get out of here, punk.

01:56.508 --> 01:57.936
I got to get showered
and get this tux on

01:57.986 --> 01:59.839
before the limo gets here.

02:13.392 --> 02:14.526
Come on, guys.

02:14.576 --> 02:15.976
We're supposed to hit the
trail in a half hour.

02:16.026 --> 02:17.485
- What are you doing?
- We're not going anywhere

02:17.535 --> 02:18.514
till we get some answers.

02:18.564 --> 02:19.615
About what?

02:19.665 --> 02:20.683
Last night.

02:20.733 --> 02:22.739
Yeah, where'd you and Deb disappear to?

02:22.789 --> 02:23.895
Seriously?

02:23.945 --> 02:25.835
She, uh, bring that
creepy mask with her?

02:25.885 --> 02:27.423
We were worried about you.

02:27.473 --> 02:28.642
Some of us.

02:28.692 --> 02:29.735
That mask isn't even hers.

02:29.785 --> 02:31.952
Okay, you guys have
the wrong idea about Deb.

02:32.746 --> 02:35.644
Yo, man. You totally banged her!

02:35.694 --> 02:37.481
What?

02:38.104 --> 02:39.896
No, I didn't.
-Yeah, you did.

02:40.015 --> 02:41.902
And I know you got it on that camera.

02:41.952 --> 02:43.307
Come on, let me check it out.

02:43.357 --> 02:44.931
Come on, let me check it out.

02:44.981 --> 02:46.388
- You guys are crazy!
- Come on, Joel!

02:46.438 --> 02:48.743
You're the one who had sex
with someone twice your age.

02:48.793 --> 02:51.107
We want details... now.

02:51.297 --> 02:53.922
Well, you and Drew got
pretty serious at the masquerade.

02:53.972 --> 02:56.154
Why don't you give us
some of those details?

02:56.612 --> 02:57.529
And on that note...

02:57.579 --> 02:59.518
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:00.135 --> 03:01.812
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

All right, come on!

03:22.962 --> 03:25.188
We're gonna make camp at High Meadow!

03:25.350 --> 03:27.627
We're gonna pitch our tents
and then cook dinner.

03:27.677 --> 03:30.518
You guys will get to see
every star in the sky from up there,

03:30.568 --> 03:31.869
and there's a Blood Moon tonight, so ...

03:31.919 --> 03:34.177
 it'll be extra awesome.

03:34.227 --> 03:35.613
Everyone follow Cricket's lead.

03:35.663 --> 03:38.348
She is our resident outdoor specialist.

03:38.501 --> 03:40.033
Pick a partner, stay in groups,

03:40.083 --> 03:42.127
and don't wander off the path!

03:42.177 --> 03:45.406
There are bear traps hidden
everywhere in these woods.

03:48.691 --> 03:50.846
You really like her, huh?

03:53.664 --> 03:55.603
I'm sorry about the
confusion last night.

03:55.653 --> 03:56.721
If we had known...

03:56.771 --> 03:59.062
Yeah, don't worry about it.

03:59.112 --> 04:00.222
I know it's none of my business,

04:00.272 --> 04:03.255
but I think it's great... you two.

04:03.332 --> 04:04.640
Who cares what they say?

04:04.690 --> 04:07.572
It's not easy to make a
connection with someone.

04:08.265 --> 04:09.280
If you're lucky enough to find it,

04:09.330 --> 04:11.759
you should go for it, right?

04:13.033 --> 04:14.773
Right.

04:15.109 --> 04:16.779
Boo!

04:18.709 --> 04:20.163
Hey, hey, what's going on?

04:20.213 --> 04:22.101
Alex said there's a monster
in these woods!

04:22.151 --> 04:24.970
Yeah, a flesh-eating ghoul

04:25.020 --> 04:27.713
with a taste for camper blood.

04:29.690 --> 04:30.779
Let's go.

04:30.829 --> 04:31.989
Whatever, Jessie.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.795
Come on. Bye, Alex.

04:37.989 --> 04:40.511
Hey, are you okay?

04:40.768 --> 04:41.824
I can't breathe.

04:41.874 --> 04:44.345
I think she needs her
inhaler. It's in the top of her bag.

04:44.395 --> 04:45.395
All right, I got it.

04:45.445 --> 04:48.156
It's gonna be okay, just relax.

04:50.694 --> 04:52.385
There you go.

04:53.507 --> 04:55.419
Better?

04:55.912 --> 04:58.546
Don't worry, Francie. It's just a story.

04:58.596 --> 05:00.394
Nothing in these woods will hurt you.

05:00.444 --> 05:02.944
I promise. 
- Okay.

05:02.994 --> 05:04.356
All right, go with Jessie.

05:04.406 --> 05:06.013
It's okay.

05:07.346 --> 05:09.112
Amy.

05:24.812 --> 05:26.495
Leave me alone.

05:38.524 --> 05:40.171
Are you okay?

05:44.430 --> 05:46.210
Did you see something?

05:47.289 --> 05:48.980
Nope.

05:50.318 --> 05:51.928
I'm good.

05:54.960 --> 05:56.705
Okay, say cheese.

05:58.498 --> 06:00.186
Smile.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.217
What is taking your brother so long?

06:03.334 --> 06:04.951
Limo's waiting.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.290
I'll go get him.

06:09.386 --> 06:10.808
Michael?

06:10.858 --> 06:12.495
Michael?

06:20.311 --> 06:21.921
Michael?!

06:56.110 --> 06:58.095
Okay, Alex and Cricket, firewood detail.

06:58.145 --> 07:00.571
Drew and Blair, get the food organized.

07:00.621 --> 07:03.713
Amy and Jessie, we
need water from the stream.

07:03.763 --> 07:05.590
And, Joel, you'll stay back with me

07:05.640 --> 07:07.140
and help me pitch the tents.

07:07.190 --> 07:09.398
Hey, have fun pitching Deb's tent.

07:09.823 --> 07:10.835
You know I will.

07:10.885 --> 07:12.469
Oh! .. Oh!

07:13.792 --> 07:15.869
Amy.
-Yeah?

07:16.359 --> 07:19.245
Um.  ... be careful out there.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.706
Is that really necessary?

07:35.756 --> 07:37.629
I found it in the staff lounge.

07:38.046 --> 07:39.390
I figured it could come in handy,

07:39.440 --> 07:41.471
being my first overnight and all.

07:44.401 --> 07:47.723
Hey, is everything okay with Joel?

07:47.903 --> 07:50.164
He seemed kind of off.

07:50.214 --> 07:52.705
Maybe he's just not as taken
with you as Garrett.

07:52.755 --> 07:54.435
Excuse me?

07:54.807 --> 07:57.672
I saw you last night with
your tongue down his throat.

07:58.985 --> 08:01.709
- I am so confused.
- Amy, just stop, okay?

08:01.759 --> 08:02.746
I saw you guys kissing.

08:02.796 --> 08:05.953
I don't remember kissing him at all.

08:06.003 --> 08:08.723
So many freaky things have been
 going on here. It's this place.

08:08.773 --> 08:10.700
No, it's you. Stop putting up a front.

08:10.750 --> 08:11.969
If you're into him, just say so.

08:12.019 --> 08:13.893
If you're into him, you say so.

08:13.943 --> 08:14.981
What are you talking about?

08:15.031 --> 08:17.419
The only one putting up
a front here is you.

08:17.612 --> 08:18.951
And Garrett's not the
only one of your old friends

08:19.001 --> 08:20.673
who doesn't like it.

08:30.237 --> 08:31.989
Joel.

08:32.561 --> 08:34.315
Can you put the
camera down for a second?

08:34.365 --> 08:35.993
I could, um...

08:36.043 --> 08:40.759
I could use a hand. I, uh... I can't get the
stake to stay in the ground.

08:42.100 --> 08:43.852
Yeah, yeah. One second.

08:46.574 --> 08:48.260
Allow me.

08:53.112 --> 08:55.803
There you go.
Nothing is knocking this thing down.

08:55.853 --> 08:58.536
Unless the cast of "Deliverance"
decides to show up.

08:59.687 --> 09:02.809
I think about that
movie every time I go camping.

09:02.859 --> 09:04.247
How can you not?

09:04.806 --> 09:07.072
Want to test it out from the inside,

09:07.122 --> 09:09.092
make sure it's extra sturdy?

09:09.142 --> 09:10.902
Um...

09:11.126 --> 09:12.759
What?

09:12.809 --> 09:13.971
I mean, it'd be hard to top last night,

09:14.021 --> 09:15.292
but I'm sure we could try.

09:15.342 --> 09:16.627
You mean the masquerade?

09:20.423 --> 09:21.564
You're funny.

09:21.614 --> 09:23.006
Yeah, I get it.

09:23.056 --> 09:24.857
It's not the time or the place.

09:24.907 --> 09:25.817
Maybe later.

09:25.867 --> 09:27.553
You all right, Joel?

09:28.399 --> 09:30.057
Yeah.

09:30.367 --> 09:32.853
It's just that when you really
make a connection with somebody,

09:32.903 --> 09:35.326
it's pretty great.

09:35.376 --> 09:37.190
That's sweet. Thank you.

09:41.093 --> 09:42.915
No way I'm doing ruffles.

09:43.459 --> 09:46.009
Hey, don't film
this, Kenny. I look like a...

09:46.059 --> 09:48.610
A hunk?
-You mean  .. dork?

09:48.660 --> 09:49.587
Hey.

09:49.637 --> 09:51.870
Come on, there's
nothing dorky about you, babe.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.342
You look like Bond.

09:53.392 --> 09:55.193
Yeah? Which one... Connery or Moore?

09:55.243 --> 09:56.861
Mm, Lazenby.

09:56.911 --> 09:58.873
Ow! You just...

09:58.923 --> 10:00.888
Come on, you're a million times
hotter than all those guys,

10:00.938 --> 10:02.992
and you know it, Mr. Golden Boy,

10:03.042 --> 10:06.496
early acceptance to NYU Film School.

10:07.058 --> 10:08.761
You better put me in all your movies.

10:08.811 --> 10:09.769
- Oh, you didn't know?
- Hmm?

10:09.819 --> 10:11.775
You're already in one of my movies.

10:11.825 --> 10:14.128
It's called "The Fitting Room."

10:14.178 --> 10:15.689
- Stop!
- Come on, come on.

10:15.739 --> 10:17.101
You can't be shy if you're
gonna be in my movies.

10:17.151 --> 10:19.320
No, no, put it down. Joel!

10:19.370 --> 10:21.570
All right, all right.

10:30.581 --> 10:32.891
Joel? 
What are you doing?

10:35.875 --> 10:37.490
Nothing.

10:39.128 --> 10:41.307
Are you gonna help me at all?

10:41.357 --> 10:43.315
I would love to, but, uh...

10:45.161 --> 10:46.816
How's this one?

10:46.978 --> 10:48.636
No, not that one.

10:48.910 --> 10:50.398
Too flimsy?

10:50.448 --> 10:52.971
Too green. It'll smoke, not burn.

10:54.277 --> 10:56.790
You really are still queen of
the overnight, aren't you?

10:56.840 --> 10:58.339
Mm-hmm.

10:58.389 --> 11:00.971
Hey, remember when we used
to call you Davy Cricket?

11:01.021 --> 11:02.249
Yeah, I remember you calling me that

11:02.299 --> 11:03.917
and me hating it.

11:03.967 --> 11:06.668
Oh, come on, you liked it.

11:06.720 --> 11:09.251
Come on, admit it.

11:09.796 --> 11:11.431
What are you doing?

11:13.366 --> 11:15.762
I told you, they're everywhere.

11:18.757 --> 11:19.922
Whoa.

11:19.972 --> 11:22.730
Not funny. You should
keep your eyes open.

11:23.149 --> 11:24.057
We all should.

11:24.107 --> 11:25.244
And why is that?

11:25.294 --> 11:26.853
Because bear traps aren't the only thing

11:26.903 --> 11:28.593
we should be worried about.

11:28.795 --> 11:29.709
Even if it wasn't Deb,

11:29.759 --> 11:32.032
I still saw someone in that mask.

11:32.429 --> 11:34.669
I didn't imagine it,
and they could still be out there.

11:36.785 --> 11:38.268
You know, it seems like...

11:38.589 --> 11:43.506
you need something else to focus on.

11:43.879 --> 11:44.876
Oh, yeah?

11:44.926 --> 11:46.412
Yeah.

11:46.462 --> 11:48.388
You know, I was thinking,
maybe I'd come here tonight,

11:48.438 --> 11:52.219
after lights out,
and watch the Blood Moon.

11:52.877 --> 11:54.585
You want to join?

11:54.822 --> 11:57.556
You mean, do I want to have sex
with you under the Blood Moon?

11:57.606 --> 11:59.460
I did not say that.

11:59.910 --> 12:01.218
I know you.

12:01.268 --> 12:02.842
Maybe I've changed, Cricket.

12:02.892 --> 12:06.560
Or maybe I'm the first girl
that's ever turned you down,

12:06.610 --> 12:09.447
and you can't handle it.

12:10.023 --> 12:11.700
Enjoy the Blood Moon.

12:14.647 --> 12:16.408
"The right stick is essential

12:16.458 --> 12:19.254
to the perfectly roasted marshmallow."

12:19.304 --> 12:20.946
I've got one.

12:21.302 --> 12:22.469
Nice!

12:22.519 --> 12:23.877
Here, let's switch.

12:23.927 --> 12:24.907
Watch out, buddy.

12:24.957 --> 12:27.137
Oh, sorry about that.

12:27.187 --> 12:28.834
That's okay.

12:29.183 --> 12:30.260
Prom date?

12:30.310 --> 12:31.717
Hey.

12:31.767 --> 12:33.498
You guys look happy.

12:34.595 --> 12:35.588
We were.

12:35.638 --> 12:36.561
Studying up?

12:36.611 --> 12:38.202
Couldn't hurt, right?

12:38.252 --> 12:41.855
Plus, you did seem
worried about me earlier.

12:41.905 --> 12:44.044
Yeah, sorry.

12:45.276 --> 12:47.158
Guess I was a little paranoid.

12:47.361 --> 12:48.990
You're good now, though?

12:49.158 --> 12:50.807
Yeah.

12:53.412 --> 12:56.042
Okay, let's see. How you doing?

13:17.478 --> 13:21.490
Kill... Amy... tonight.

13:22.049 --> 13:24.599
Or someone else will die.

13:46.278 --> 13:47.884
Blair.

13:48.362 --> 13:49.649
What's Cricket's favorite song?

13:49.699 --> 13:50.732
Why?

13:50.782 --> 13:52.451
What do you care why?

13:53.460 --> 13:54.633
Is this that thing that straight guys do

13:54.683 --> 13:56.587
when girls reject them?

13:56.637 --> 13:59.036
Come on, favorite song... easy answer.

13:59.086 --> 14:00.984
Blotter already made her a mix tape.

14:01.034 --> 14:02.037
Yeah, I know.

14:02.087 --> 14:04.796
I was hoping maybe
he'd forgotten a track.

14:05.539 --> 14:06.515
He did, actually.

14:06.565 --> 14:07.985
"The Killing Moon," Echo & the Bunnymen,

14:08.035 --> 14:09.496
her all-time favorite.

14:09.546 --> 14:11.226
- "Killing Moon"?
- Mm-hmm.

14:11.276 --> 14:12.224
Okay.

14:12.274 --> 14:14.364
Hey, you got "Killing Moon," Drewski?

14:15.066 --> 14:16.683
Grab it from my tent.

14:16.733 --> 14:18.514
Also, never call me Drewski again,

14:18.564 --> 14:20.366
or I will end your life.

14:20.416 --> 14:22.043
Fair enough.

14:25.783 --> 14:27.585
That was really cool of you.

14:29.929 --> 14:31.340
Look, I don't blame you
for being mad at me.

14:31.390 --> 14:32.667
I just wanted to say...

14:32.717 --> 14:34.917
Okay, you had your chance.

14:34.967 --> 14:36.746
Well, I'm asking for another one.

14:38.368 --> 14:39.909
You showed me who you are.

14:39.959 --> 14:43.287
I showed you who I was.
What's left to say?

14:48.528 --> 14:50.245
Oh, God!

14:50.990 --> 14:52.964
Someone forgot to put ice in there.

14:54.599 --> 14:55.551
Ugh.

14:55.601 --> 14:56.500
Okay. It's okay.

14:56.550 --> 14:59.002
Um, there's hot
dogs, uh, down at the camp.

14:59.052 --> 15:00.686
Not it!

15:03.200 --> 15:04.139
I'll go.

15:04.189 --> 15:05.211
Thank you.
- Kill her.

15:05.261 --> 15:07.545
Amy, don't go.

15:09.004 --> 15:11.224
Why not?
- Uh...

15:12.231 --> 15:13.663
She doesn't know these woods.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.364
So go with her.

15:15.539 --> 15:16.440
Follow her.

15:16.490 --> 15:18.020
When she's alone, kill her.

15:18.070 --> 15:19.002
No.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.686
No?

15:21.500 --> 15:22.491
Okay.

15:22.541 --> 15:23.875
Uh, Amy, you're better with the kids.

15:23.925 --> 15:25.177
Jessie and I will go.

15:25.227 --> 15:27.000
Exactly.

15:29.566 --> 15:31.175
It's your choice.

15:35.330 --> 15:36.944
Her...

15:38.009 --> 15:41.109
or someone else will die.

15:41.458 --> 15:42.815
Ow!

15:42.865 --> 15:46.296
Do you see this,
Laura? I went old-school.

15:47.288 --> 15:51.664
I got the white
limo. I got the... orchid.

15:52.424 --> 15:55.359
I'm even gonna bribe the deejay
to play that Paula Abdul song you love.

16:00.999 --> 16:02.719
It's gonna be a perfect night.

16:16.180 --> 16:17.825
What do you want?!

16:31.766 --> 16:33.390
Where are you?

16:37.220 --> 16:39.338
I'm showing this to the cops!

16:51.248 --> 16:52.941
Hey!

16:53.601 --> 16:54.805
- Oh, Dad.
- You okay?

16:54.855 --> 16:56.910
I, uh... I heard you yelling.

16:56.960 --> 16:58.913
Yeah, uh, I was just...

16:59.359 --> 17:02.393
this thing is... I can't figure it out.

17:02.838 --> 17:04.473
I got frustrated.

17:04.523 --> 17:07.082
I figured I'd just come outside
and get some fresh air.

17:08.036 --> 17:10.365
Here, let me help you out.

17:10.638 --> 17:13.453
Now, you better get used
to wearing a tux.

17:14.269 --> 17:17.675
Tonight the prom, tomorrow the Emmys.

17:17.726 --> 17:20.821
Oscars. It's Oscars for movies, Dad.

17:20.872 --> 17:22.979
Yeah, well, whatever it is,

17:23.029 --> 17:26.284
I will be there front row
and center, cheering you on.

17:27.470 --> 17:29.085
Thanks, Dad.

17:29.977 --> 17:31.685
Are you nervous?

17:32.171 --> 17:33.953
About tonight?

17:36.489 --> 17:38.398
I'm just thinking about Michael.

17:39.374 --> 17:41.073
Prom night.

17:41.423 --> 17:43.547
Did he ever tell you what he saw?

17:43.956 --> 17:45.315
No, he never would.

17:45.365 --> 17:48.517
We didn't know what he was seeing

17:49.369 --> 17:52.387
or why he was so... so scared of it.

17:52.847 --> 17:54.479
Me and him.

17:55.660 --> 17:56.769
I mean, it doesn't matter, does it?

17:56.819 --> 18:00.010
Whatever he saw, it wasn't real.

18:01.358 --> 18:03.050
Just a sickness in his mind.

18:03.100 --> 18:05.016
I thank God, that you will never... 

18:05.371 --> 18:07.292
never have to face 
that nightmare.

18:10.152 --> 18:11.750
Are you sure you're okay?

18:11.925 --> 18:13.352
You know, whatever it is,

18:15.273 --> 18:16.953
you know you can tell me, right?

18:19.090 --> 18:20.881
Maybe I'm a little nervous.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.494
Don't want to disappoint Laura.

18:25.812 --> 18:27.497
You won't.

18:34.903 --> 18:36.520
Hey.

18:36.905 --> 18:38.192
What's up? Kids okay?

18:38.242 --> 18:40.365
Yeah, kids are okay.

18:40.973 --> 18:42.580
Um...

18:44.813 --> 18:46.169
But I'm not.

18:46.219 --> 18:48.192
I had a feeling something was up.

18:49.566 --> 18:51.230
What is it?

18:51.305 --> 18:53.734
I've never told anyone this before.

18:57.789 --> 18:59.007
It's all right. 
- Yeah.

18:59.057 --> 19:00.384
I feel like I have
a connection with you.

19:00.434 --> 19:02.090
Yeah.

19:04.982 --> 19:05.936
Hey.

19:05.986 --> 19:07.754
What are you doing?

19:08.417 --> 19:10.711
I thought...
- You thought what?

19:12.261 --> 19:13.844
I want to help, Joel, I do,

19:13.894 --> 19:17.415
um, but I'm... I'm still your boss.

19:19.176 --> 19:21.438
What are you talking about,
you're still my boss?

19:21.488 --> 19:22.440
What about last night?

19:22.490 --> 19:24.677
You can't just act
like that didn't happen.

19:24.727 --> 19:26.593
Act like what didn't happen?

19:26.643 --> 19:29.400
We went for a walk.
I told you about Keith.

19:29.450 --> 19:32.254
That's... it.

19:34.615 --> 19:36.283
Um...

19:36.787 --> 19:38.825
Why don't you tell me
what's really going on.

19:39.695 --> 19:42.825
Um, I... I... I guess I just...

19:42.875 --> 19:44.311
I read more into it.

19:44.361 --> 19:45.278
I'm sorry.

19:45.328 --> 19:46.324
It's okay.

19:46.374 --> 19:48.062
Uh, I'm gonna go.

20:42.942 --> 20:45.236
You can't make me go away.

20:45.286 --> 20:49.480
Not here, not until you kill Amy.

20:58.460 --> 21:01.524
Remember, you're the boss, okay?

21:01.574 --> 21:03.254
Don't let the marshmallow win.

21:06.009 --> 21:07.683
You should go.

21:08.038 --> 21:09.916
To his Blood Moon rendezvous?

21:09.966 --> 21:10.881
No, thanks.

21:10.931 --> 21:12.333
I think he's changed.

21:12.383 --> 21:13.370
Please.

21:13.420 --> 21:14.695
He's a dirt bag, and you know it.

21:14.745 --> 21:16.394
If all he wanted was to sleep with you,

21:16.444 --> 21:19.055
why would he ask me
what your favorite song is?

21:19.955 --> 21:21.529
He asked you my favorite song?

21:21.579 --> 21:24.480
Yeah,  He's putting himself out there.

21:25.469 --> 21:27.207
Just give him the chance.

21:35.595 --> 21:37.471
You're running out of time.

21:42.080 --> 21:43.717
Don't do that.

21:44.861 --> 21:45.824
You could hurt yourself.

21:45.874 --> 21:47.519
Joel.

21:48.183 --> 21:50.366
Kill  ... Amy.

21:50.886 --> 21:54.311
Her, or someone else will die.

21:54.361 --> 21:56.994
Who will it be?

21:57.307 --> 21:59.002
You're running out of time.

22:00.710 --> 22:02.339
Who's it gonna be?

22:10.169 --> 22:11.815
Joel?

22:18.947 --> 22:19.974
Where's your camera?

22:20.024 --> 22:21.988
It's usually attached to your hand.

22:22.038 --> 22:23.703
It's not working.

22:24.001 --> 22:25.605
Is it broken?

22:25.655 --> 22:27.034
It doesn't work here.

22:28.591 --> 22:29.599
- Ah.
- Ah.

22:29.649 --> 22:30.575
That was a good one.

22:30.625 --> 22:32.750
My eyes were closed. I want a do-over.

22:32.800 --> 22:34.857
You looked gorgeous, babe.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.706
Come on.

22:40.478 --> 22:42.417
Wait, you're bringing that?

22:43.269 --> 22:44.810
Yeah, it's... it's our prom night.

22:44.860 --> 22:45.875
Don't you want to remember this forever?

22:45.925 --> 22:48.041
Tonight's about us, our memories.

22:48.091 --> 22:49.468
You don't need a camera for that.

22:49.518 --> 22:51.919
Hey, Laura, come here.

22:51.969 --> 22:53.667
Okay.

23:04.734 --> 23:06.368
You're not real.

23:08.465 --> 23:10.103
You're not real.

23:14.452 --> 23:15.956
You're not real.

23:16.006 --> 23:17.707
Who are you talking to?

23:21.025 --> 23:22.543
No one.

23:22.593 --> 23:24.223
Uh...

23:24.412 --> 23:26.618
All right, you're right.
I'll be right back.

23:26.702 --> 23:28.280
I'm just gonna go check this.

23:29.020 --> 23:29.934
Hey, how's it going?

23:29.984 --> 23:31.171
Here you go.

23:31.221 --> 23:32.269
Yeah, I can take that for you.

23:32.319 --> 23:33.400
Thanks.

23:36.439 --> 23:38.021
What are we waiting for, huh?

23:38.071 --> 23:39.316
Oh, you ready to dance, or what?

23:39.366 --> 23:40.989
Get over here.

23:41.039 --> 23:42.703
Huh?

23:48.451 --> 23:49.776
I mean, cut Blair some slack.

23:49.826 --> 23:50.951
He... he's... He ran out on me.

23:51.001 --> 23:53.390
So? Now he wants to un-run.

23:54.056 --> 23:56.968
You have no idea what it's like
to be that open with someone.

23:57.032 --> 23:58.309
You can't even tell Sykes

23:58.359 --> 23:59.995
about your court date.

24:02.791 --> 24:04.461
Just saying.

24:05.950 --> 24:07.484
What's that?

24:07.534 --> 24:10.881
I think that's the cabin
that Alex took Amy on their date.

24:11.592 --> 24:13.249
Hot.

24:18.516 --> 24:19.854
What are you doing here?

24:19.913 --> 24:21.636
I'm patrolling camp
while everyone else is ...

24:21.686 --> 24:22.851
supposed to be on the overnight,

24:22.905 --> 24:23.967
so why aren't you with them?

24:24.017 --> 24:27.185
We were.
We are. Hmm. ...We are.

24:27.609 --> 24:30.410
Okay. Um, I'm gonna take this.

24:30.573 --> 24:31.556
You know how to get back, right?

24:31.606 --> 24:33.784
- Yeah.
- Great.

24:37.799 --> 24:40.795
So, what brings you out here?

24:41.435 --> 24:43.097
Going in there.

24:44.999 --> 24:46.734
Do you want some company?

24:48.038 --> 24:49.642
Sure.

25:03.920 --> 25:05.707
What is this place?

25:07.515 --> 25:09.147
It's just an old hunting cabin.

25:09.197 --> 25:10.335
You're a terrible liar.

25:10.385 --> 25:12.629
It's part of an investigation
I'm conducting.

25:12.679 --> 25:13.624
Into what?

25:13.674 --> 25:14.987
Did you know Stillwater
was a Spiritualist camp?

25:15.037 --> 25:18.760
Oh, like those
cultists Amy was talking about?

25:18.829 --> 25:20.559
She told you?

25:21.114 --> 25:22.615
I didn't realize it was a secret.

25:22.665 --> 25:24.791
Why are you being so cagey?

25:28.733 --> 25:30.615
There was a raid on this cabin in 1871.

25:30.665 --> 25:33.508
They were after a Spiritualist
leader named Holyoke.

25:39.734 --> 25:42.092
People in the lake were his followers.

25:42.486 --> 25:44.251
What happened to them?

25:44.554 --> 25:46.498
The same thing that always
happens with these cults.

25:46.548 --> 25:48.290
Everybody dies.

25:50.631 --> 25:52.390
But this was over 100
years ago. Why are you...

25:52.440 --> 25:54.805
Because I still think there
might be some followers kicking around.

25:54.855 --> 25:56.048
Come on, seriously?

25:56.098 --> 25:58.716
Last night, I saw these
people down by the lake.

25:58.766 --> 25:59.903
They were wearing these masks.

25:59.953 --> 26:01.541
Well, it was a masked ball.

26:01.591 --> 26:03.590
I mean, they could have been anyone.

26:04.132 --> 26:05.845
Yeah, maybe.

26:05.930 --> 26:07.985
But I still wanted to come
check this place out,

26:08.035 --> 26:09.992
make sure nobody's been digging around,

26:10.060 --> 26:11.806
getting ideas.

26:15.336 --> 26:16.946
Look.

26:38.581 --> 26:40.321
What the hell is that?

26:40.535 --> 26:43.803
This is how people used to record
things in the 19th century.

26:43.853 --> 26:47.669
"Holyoke"... that's the guy
you were just talking about.

26:47.719 --> 26:49.478
That's him, right?

26:49.920 --> 26:51.613
There's something else.

26:53.192 --> 26:54.811
What is that, a coin?

26:55.381 --> 26:56.645
It's a cufflink.

26:56.695 --> 26:58.487
J.S.

26:58.940 --> 27:00.561
Jack Sykes.

27:02.210 --> 27:03.920
This belonged to my father.

27:13.789 --> 27:14.710
You think she's gonna come?

27:14.760 --> 27:16.812
Only one way to find out.

27:17.988 --> 27:19.800
Get down there and wait for her.

27:20.672 --> 27:22.738
I can do that. Thanks.

27:22.788 --> 27:24.572
Hey!

27:25.418 --> 27:27.150
Hey!

27:27.943 --> 27:28.879
Where you going?

27:28.929 --> 27:31.360
Uh, to watch the Blood Moon.

27:31.410 --> 27:33.081
Alone?

27:33.131 --> 27:34.375
Hopefully not.

27:34.425 --> 27:36.165
Is there a problem?

27:36.215 --> 27:37.214
Just be careful.

27:37.264 --> 27:38.989
Sure thing, Dad.

27:39.701 --> 27:42.825
Hey, um... thanks for the tape, buddy.

27:42.875 --> 27:45.690
Yeah, I don't like "buddy," either.

27:47.417 --> 27:48.820
Hey.

27:48.870 --> 27:51.236
Good luck. I hope she shows.

27:51.710 --> 27:53.370
Thanks.

27:54.701 --> 27:56.170
Where's Jessie?

27:56.220 --> 27:57.823
She's with Sykes.

27:58.243 --> 28:00.962
Is she okay?
-She's fine. What's wrong with you?

28:01.012 --> 28:02.838
I'm just making sure that she's okay.

28:03.668 --> 28:04.830
Hey.

28:04.880 --> 28:06.103
That everyone's safe.

28:06.153 --> 28:07.120
No one is.

28:07.170 --> 28:11.344
No one is until you kill Amy.

28:17.471 --> 28:19.203
Guys.

28:19.753 --> 28:21.671
Deb needs us now.

28:24.062 --> 28:26.012
Where did you leave it, sweetheart?
Do you remember?
- - What happened?

28:26.627 --> 28:27.651
She lost her inhaler.

28:27.701 --> 28:30.027
She can't breathe if
we don't get it back.

28:31.018 --> 28:34.184
Or someone else will die.

28:34.234 --> 28:37.359
Hey, Francie, do you think you might
have left it where we stopped earlier?

28:37.820 --> 28:39.423
- Yeah?
- I'll go get it.

28:39.473 --> 28:41.135
- I'll go with you.
- No.

28:41.185 --> 28:42.123
You stay here.

28:42.173 --> 28:43.623
Hey, listen, maybe Amy should go.

28:43.673 --> 28:44.707
You've been a little
out of sorts lately.

28:44.757 --> 28:46.064
No, I can do this.

28:46.114 --> 28:47.226
I have to do this.

28:47.276 --> 28:49.635
Here, take this.

28:50.718 --> 28:52.498
Just in case.

28:54.793 --> 28:57.247
You have something else to do.

28:59.656 --> 29:02.460
No. She's not dying.

29:03.712 --> 29:05.327
No one is.

29:11.826 --> 29:14.281
Did you know your dad
had been here before?

29:15.526 --> 29:18.376
I didn't even know this
place existed until a few days ago.

29:21.062 --> 29:22.883
What do you think he was doing here?

29:23.417 --> 29:25.209
Considering where we found this,

29:26.237 --> 29:28.215
he was doing the same thing we are.

29:32.468 --> 29:36.010
My bright ambassadors of morning!

29:36.582 --> 29:39.724
It is time to make peace.

29:39.774 --> 29:42.318
Lay down your burden.

29:42.368 --> 29:43.856
Is that him... Holyoke?

29:43.906 --> 29:48.585
Take the potion and
step through quietly.

29:48.635 --> 29:49.983
Potion?

29:50.033 --> 29:52.508
I think he's telling them
to kill themselves.

29:52.558 --> 29:56.056
Believe in the power of the lake,

29:56.152 --> 29:59.644
and it will reveal the truth.

30:00.143 --> 30:01.847
He was evil.

30:02.579 --> 30:03.876
But his followers?

30:03.926 --> 30:05.787
They did anything he told them.

30:07.026 --> 30:08.264
Anything.

30:08.314 --> 30:12.357
Take the potion and step through.

30:13.360 --> 30:15.024
No.

30:54.101 --> 30:55.718
No.

30:57.509 --> 30:58.542
Who are you?!

30:58.592 --> 31:00.287
What do you want from me?!

31:00.337 --> 31:03.883
The same thing I wanted from Michael...

31:04.330 --> 31:07.941
for you to do what I say.

31:14.861 --> 31:17.419
What are you doing?!

31:17.629 --> 31:20.075
What are you doing?!

31:48.654 --> 31:49.737
What are you doing here?

31:49.787 --> 31:51.516
I was worried.

31:51.656 --> 31:53.890
You shouldn't be out here alone.

31:56.803 --> 31:58.546
Kill her.

31:58.703 --> 32:00.447
Do it.

32:00.679 --> 32:01.947
Now.

32:01.997 --> 32:03.728
Joel?

32:03.953 --> 32:05.714
What are you doing?

32:09.878 --> 32:12.576
Her, or someone else.

32:14.514 --> 32:17.362
Her, or someone else.

32:17.412 --> 32:20.142
Her, or someone else.

32:20.330 --> 32:22.730
Her, or someone else.

32:23.927 --> 32:25.439
Joel.

32:25.489 --> 32:27.208
Joel.

32:29.051 --> 32:30.546
Put down the knife.

32:30.596 --> 32:31.890
Kill! No.

32:31.940 --> 32:33.871
Kill her! Kill her!

32:36.495 --> 32:38.076
He'll never leave me alone.

32:38.126 --> 32:40.494
Who? There's no one here.

32:41.438 --> 32:43.719
Joel, stop! Stop!

32:43.769 --> 32:44.774
Kill her!

32:44.824 --> 32:46.320
There's no one here.

32:46.370 --> 32:48.542
There's no one here.

32:51.430 --> 32:54.299
Everything's gonna be
okay. Just breathe.

32:58.562 --> 33:00.034
It's okay.

33:00.084 --> 33:01.822
It's okay.

33:04.338 --> 33:06.993
- Here you go. Get home safe.
- Okay.

33:21.301 --> 33:22.305
Is Kenny okay?

33:22.355 --> 33:23.966
No, he's not okay.

33:24.016 --> 33:25.548
You broke his nose,

33:25.598 --> 33:28.162
and he didn't buy
your lame excuse, either.

33:28.212 --> 33:29.207
I was drunk.

33:29.257 --> 33:30.792
You had half a beer in the limo.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.542
What's going on, Joel?

33:32.592 --> 33:34.965
Tell me the truth. I already told you.

33:36.833 --> 33:40.264
I knew Michael, too, and you're
acting just like him.

33:40.545 --> 33:42.575
Michael kept everything inside,
and it killed him.

33:42.625 --> 33:45.820
If he'd asked for help...
- What killed him was being
seen as a freak.

33:47.178 --> 33:48.889
The minute he told my parents,

33:49.215 --> 33:51.205
they looked at him like a crazy kid.

33:51.691 --> 33:52.668
They never looked at him the same.

33:52.718 --> 33:55.494
I will never look at you like that.

33:56.105 --> 33:58.349
You don't have to pretend with me, Joel.

33:58.399 --> 34:00.049
You don't have to be perfect.

34:00.099 --> 34:01.806
Just talk with me.

34:01.856 --> 34:03.617
I want to help you.

34:08.330 --> 34:10.120
I don't need your help.

34:15.481 --> 34:17.245
We're done.

34:25.768 --> 34:27.505
Hey.

34:27.991 --> 34:30.291
Well, Francie's
breathing normally again.

34:30.341 --> 34:32.054
She's gonna be okay.

34:32.105 --> 34:33.683
Thanks to you.

34:33.733 --> 34:35.810
Now, everybody, get to bed.

34:35.860 --> 34:38.518
It's been a long night... for all of us.

34:39.751 --> 34:41.949
Guess that's my cue, too, right?

34:42.000 --> 34:43.746
So you're gonna go meet him?

34:44.349 --> 34:46.098
Got to give it a shot.

34:47.193 --> 34:48.656
I'm proud of you.

34:48.706 --> 34:50.797
Hold the pride till we see how it goes.

34:54.239 --> 34:56.023
Uh, hey, Blair?

34:58.305 --> 35:00.404
Go ahead. It's okay.

35:02.555 --> 35:04.399
I need to talk to you guys.

35:09.698 --> 35:12.939
My whole life, I've tried to be strong.

35:15.876 --> 35:17.922
You know, act like everything was fine,

35:18.312 --> 35:20.506
but I haven't been honest
about who I really am.

35:22.107 --> 35:23.914
I used to have a brother.

35:27.040 --> 35:28.761
Michael.

35:31.616 --> 35:34.126
When Michael was my age,
he killed himself.

35:38.211 --> 35:42.561
He saw things that... weren't there.

35:44.583 --> 35:46.326
Michael had a sickness.

35:48.291 --> 35:50.365
And now I have that sickness, too.

35:54.757 --> 35:58.261
My camera used to be the
only thing that I could trust

35:58.311 --> 36:00.123
to show me what's real.

36:00.287 --> 36:02.078
It never lied.

36:06.307 --> 36:08.158
But now the camera's not working,

36:08.567 --> 36:10.225
and I'm getting worse.

36:10.652 --> 36:12.405
What do you mean?

36:13.841 --> 36:15.612
There's a man.

36:16.305 --> 36:19.231
I started seeing him
before I ever came to camp.

36:19.281 --> 36:22.005
I think Michael saw the same man.

36:22.932 --> 36:26.365
He never left him alone.

36:26.916 --> 36:30.575
And now he's following me,
asking me to do things.

36:31.962 --> 36:33.711
Terrible things.

36:33.798 --> 36:35.311
Like what?

36:35.361 --> 36:38.393
Tonight he told me to kill Amy.

36:39.832 --> 36:41.662
Or else someone else would die.

36:45.303 --> 36:47.203
He's not real.

36:47.623 --> 36:48.989
You know that, right? That's just it.

36:49.039 --> 36:51.336
I don't know what's real
and what isn't anymore,

36:51.386 --> 36:52.411
and I'm worried.

36:52.461 --> 36:55.618
If I don't find a way
to stop seeing him...

36:59.268 --> 37:01.217
I'm gonna end up just like Michael.

37:03.512 --> 37:05.212
I need to leave camp.

37:09.313 --> 37:11.024
I need help.

37:12.811 --> 37:14.754
We'll help you, too, Joel.

37:15.069 --> 37:16.868
Whatever you need.

37:17.001 --> 37:19.127
You don't have to hide things from us.

37:19.318 --> 37:21.086
We're here for you.

37:23.763 --> 37:25.546
Thanks.

37:27.158 --> 37:28.940
What'd I miss?

37:30.402 --> 37:32.629
It's been a night.

37:33.144 --> 37:34.686
You and me both.

37:34.736 --> 37:36.596
I ran into Garrett in the woods.

37:36.646 --> 37:38.667
He was checking out this old cabin.

37:38.717 --> 37:40.148
We found recordings of this cult leader

37:40.198 --> 37:42.507
telling all of his followers
to kill themselves.

37:42.557 --> 37:44.166
Holyoke.

37:44.216 --> 37:45.262
You know about him, too?

37:45.312 --> 37:46.809
Garrett told me not to say anything.

37:46.859 --> 37:48.557
He didn't want us freaking out.

37:48.607 --> 37:50.365
There's nothing to freak out about.

37:50.764 --> 37:54.895
He's dead. Still, he's pretty creepy.

37:57.634 --> 37:59.991
Joel, what is it?

38:01.531 --> 38:02.533
That's him.

38:02.583 --> 38:04.733
That's the man who's been following me.

38:06.039 --> 38:08.258
Joel, what if your brother wasn't sick?

38:08.308 --> 38:12.473
What if the man he saw...
the one you've been seeing...

38:12.523 --> 38:14.476
what if that was Holyoke?

38:14.526 --> 38:17.173
Ghosts? Seriously?

38:17.223 --> 38:19.265
It's what I've been saying.

38:19.524 --> 38:21.247
It's this place.

38:22.764 --> 38:26.314
There's something here.
Something that knows us.

38:27.294 --> 38:30.608
This place, it feeds on our weaknesses,

38:30.796 --> 38:33.252
and Holyoke has something to do with it.

38:33.302 --> 38:34.293
Come on, Amy.

38:34.343 --> 38:37.175
Even if that were true,
why is Joel the only one who's seen him?

38:38.129 --> 38:40.133
He isn't the only one.

38:42.016 --> 38:46.079
The Tall Man... that was him.

38:46.129 --> 38:47.861
You've seen him, too?

38:49.943 --> 38:51.707
Why us?

38:51.833 --> 38:52.907
What does he want?

38:52.957 --> 38:55.232
He told you what he wants.

38:56.480 --> 38:57.901
You didn't listen.

38:57.951 --> 39:01.034
What did he say?
Did he tell you why he's speaking to us?

39:01.232 --> 39:02.937
No.

39:02.987 --> 39:06.605
What did he say?
- He said you should have killed her...

39:06.655 --> 39:08.569
when you had the chance.

39:45.924 --> 39:47.692
Hello?

39:50.021 --> 39:51.815
Cricket, is that you?
