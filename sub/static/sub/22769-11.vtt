02:39.790 --> 02:42.170
Howdy and hello, Mr. Fred.

02:42.170 --> 02:43.710
Welcome back to Noodle Burger,

02:43.710 --> 02:45.500
where we do swell well.

02:45.500 --> 02:47.380
You can't beat Noodle Burger!

02:47.380 --> 02:50.620
I'll have our noodle dudes
make your Friday favorite,

02:50.620 --> 02:53.250
a Noodle Burger,
crunchy style!

02:53.250 --> 02:56.170
Bring the heat! WTMP.

02:56.170 --> 02:57.830
What did any of that mean?

02:57.830 --> 03:00.120
"Crunchy style" means
I like my noodle bun
extra crunchy.

03:00.120 --> 03:02.000
"Bring the heat" means
add chili sauce.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.120
And "WTMP" stands for

03:04.120 --> 03:05.540
"way too many pickles."

03:05.540 --> 03:06.620
Obviously on that one.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.620
That is way
too many pickles.

03:08.620 --> 03:10.710
Yeah. He's basically psychic.

03:10.710 --> 03:12.210
-Can I get a little--
-Ketchup?

03:12.210 --> 03:13.920
Coming right up!

03:13.920 --> 03:15.960
A-ha! See what
I'm talking about?

03:15.960 --> 03:17.330
Sorry, misters,

03:17.330 --> 03:18.540
since we just met,

03:18.540 --> 03:20.880
I am unable to predict
your orders.

03:20.880 --> 03:23.460
But I can't wait
to get to know you!

03:23.460 --> 03:24.920
Not exactly psychic,

03:24.920 --> 03:27.460
but it is a killer
prediction algorithm.

03:27.460 --> 03:29.120
Gee whiz, mister,

03:29.120 --> 03:31.000
would you like some
Noodle Burger stickers?

03:31.000 --> 03:33.500
Of me, Noodle Burger Boy?

03:33.500 --> 03:35.380
-He is a robot.
-Yes, he is.

03:35.380 --> 03:37.540
-What is his function?
-I spread happiness.

03:37.540 --> 03:40.170
And stickers! Yay, me!

03:43.580 --> 03:46.500
You look extra swell.

03:48.250 --> 03:50.210
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

04:04.170 --> 04:05.580
Noodle Burger is now closed.

04:05.580 --> 04:07.420
Can I help you
with something else?

04:07.420 --> 04:08.790
Yes.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.620
I believe you can.

04:11.920 --> 04:13.960
And then Noodle Burger Boy,
guess what?

04:13.960 --> 04:15.830
He gave me some stickers.

04:15.830 --> 04:17.750
-Look!
-Mm-hmm.

04:19.580 --> 04:21.210
You guys aren't looking.

04:21.210 --> 04:23.210
I don't understand
why you wouldn't look,
they're stickers!

04:23.210 --> 04:25.540
That's great, Freddy.
You seem really happy.

04:25.540 --> 04:27.710
Uh, yes, Honey Lemon,
I am happy.

04:27.710 --> 04:28.960
I have stickers.

04:28.960 --> 04:31.580
I was not designed
to remove stickers.

04:31.580 --> 04:33.710
Baymax, my man!
Did you get scratch 'n sniff?

04:33.710 --> 04:35.670
(sniffing)
Yes. Yes, you did.

04:35.670 --> 04:37.040
Good morning, students.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.120
(sniffing)

04:39.120 --> 04:40.790
And others.

04:40.790 --> 04:42.460
(sniffs)

04:46.420 --> 04:48.710
The International Space Agency

04:48.710 --> 04:51.620
has contacted all the top
science institutions

04:51.620 --> 04:53.580
about a competition.

04:53.580 --> 04:57.040
Space junk is collecting
at at exponential rate.

04:57.040 --> 05:01.040
The challenge
is to design a machine
to gather all the debris

05:01.040 --> 05:02.750
and dispose of it.

05:02.750 --> 05:04.040
Are any of you interested?

05:04.040 --> 05:05.620
(together)
I'll do it.

05:05.620 --> 05:07.040
Perfect.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.750
It's a tight deadline.
You two can work as a team.

05:09.750 --> 05:12.750
Oh, um, I was thinking
I'd enter... myself.

05:12.750 --> 05:16.000
Yeah,
and that I also would enter,
but just myself.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.830
-Not that there's anything
wrong with Wasabi.
-Or with Hiro!

05:18.830 --> 05:20.250
That's not what we're saying.

05:20.250 --> 05:21.920
-We just want--
-You want to work individually.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.460
Yes, I get it,
but you're not going to.

05:24.460 --> 05:27.330
Your skill sets
compliment each other,

05:27.330 --> 05:30.290
and I want to win,
so that's what's happening.

05:30.290 --> 05:32.710
Working prototypes
are due next Thursday.

05:32.710 --> 05:34.080
Good luck!

05:35.540 --> 05:37.620
We're friends,
we can make this work.

05:37.620 --> 05:39.580
Absolutely.

05:39.580 --> 05:41.210
It will be fun.

05:41.210 --> 05:42.830
Guys, we've got a situation.

05:44.040 --> 05:46.670
Bluff Dunder on the scene
reporting on a anonymous tip

05:46.670 --> 05:49.710
that some disaster
would occur in this area
at exactly three o'clock,

05:49.710 --> 05:52.000
which is, um...

05:52.000 --> 05:53.920
-Now. Yes!
-(passengers screaming)

05:53.920 --> 05:55.250
(clears throat)

05:55.250 --> 05:56.500
Horrible news.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.460
A runaway streetcar
is careening down Nobu Hill.

05:58.460 --> 05:59.830
Is there no one to stop it?

05:59.830 --> 06:02.080
(screaming)

06:06.210 --> 06:08.620
(honking)

06:08.620 --> 06:10.250
We better hurry.
A lot of people up ahead!

06:13.210 --> 06:15.880
Well, howdy and hello,

06:15.880 --> 06:17.830
Big Hero 6!

06:21.710 --> 06:23.620
This is your stop!
Watch your step.

06:23.620 --> 06:25.710
Do not worry!
I'm not an actual lizard.

06:25.710 --> 06:28.250
This is just a very
convincing costume.
I'm here to help.

06:28.250 --> 06:30.420
(crying, whimpering):
Oh, thank you! Thank you!

06:30.420 --> 06:32.420
Uh, guys, I've got a clinger!

06:32.420 --> 06:33.620
Hiro:
We're on it!

06:37.710 --> 06:39.330
I've got you! (grunts)

06:39.330 --> 06:41.790
One for you, you, and you!

06:41.790 --> 06:42.830
Go, go, and go!

06:42.830 --> 06:45.120
(grunting)

06:45.120 --> 06:46.830
(streetcar bell clanging)

06:48.620 --> 06:51.290
Whoa! Ah! Ah!

06:51.290 --> 06:53.670
Baymax:
It is now safe
to disembark.

06:53.670 --> 06:54.790
I don't know what happened!

06:54.790 --> 06:57.880
Emergency brake just failed.
It's the weirdest thing.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.380
Hiro:
Baymax, can you
take a look?

06:59.380 --> 07:00.670
Baymax:
Scanning.

07:01.670 --> 07:04.080
The emergency brake
has been disabled.

07:04.080 --> 07:07.580
I detect a small amount
of... ketchup on it.

07:07.580 --> 07:09.500
Ketchup? That's
really weird.

07:09.500 --> 07:12.040
Yeah, and who
sent us the tip
this was going to happen?

07:12.040 --> 07:14.880
-And how much hugging
is too much hugging?
-Oh, thank you, thank you!

07:16.250 --> 07:18.830
Noodle Burger Boy:
Special order!

07:21.170 --> 07:23.170
Uh... guys?

07:23.170 --> 07:25.250
(missile whistling)

07:27.960 --> 07:29.290
Oh, that's not good!

07:29.290 --> 07:30.380
(grunts)

07:32.920 --> 07:34.920
Phew!

07:34.920 --> 07:35.960
Are you okay?

07:35.960 --> 07:37.250
Eww! Thanks!

07:37.250 --> 07:39.540
That's gross, but thanks.

07:41.620 --> 07:43.880
Order complete.

07:43.880 --> 07:44.750
Hee-hee-hee.

07:46.960 --> 07:50.290
What if it's a mech suit
that either a robot
or a human could wear.

07:50.290 --> 07:51.960
That's interesting.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.830
And to break up
bigger pieces of space junk,

07:53.830 --> 07:55.580
we could add a plasma blaster.

07:55.580 --> 07:57.750
We'd also need something
to contain the debris.

07:57.750 --> 08:00.120
But a vacuum
won't work in space,

08:00.120 --> 08:03.540
so, maybe a high-capacity,
super strong net?

08:03.540 --> 08:05.710
Great idea!
Let's sketch it out.

08:07.580 --> 08:09.460
Um, Hiro?

08:09.460 --> 08:10.710
-What?
-Your feet.

08:10.710 --> 08:12.710
My desk? Uh-uh.

08:12.710 --> 08:14.460
Okay...
(laughs awkwardly)

08:14.460 --> 08:16.250
Let's--
let's work in my lab.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.120
What do you think of this?

08:24.120 --> 08:26.000
-I can't see it.
-So come closer.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.120
I don't think so.

08:27.120 --> 08:28.670
I need order to think clearly

08:28.670 --> 08:30.830
and your lab
is the opposite of order.

08:41.460 --> 08:44.580

Sorry, Fred, I have too much
work to do on the mech suit
to go looking for Noodle Boy.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.080
Noodle Burger Boy.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.290
How could you forget
the burger part?

09:42.290 --> 09:43.830
That's where his face is.

09:43.830 --> 09:44.920
It sure is.

09:44.920 --> 09:46.920
Wasabi,
why don't you go?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.460
I-I could handle
things here.

09:48.460 --> 09:51.670
That is so...
generous, Hiro,

09:51.670 --> 09:54.880
but I volunteer to stay
and continue our work
in an orderly fashion.

09:54.880 --> 09:56.420
Wasabi and Hiro

09:56.420 --> 09:58.620
are showing
elevated stress levels.

09:58.620 --> 10:00.210
May I offer you a sticker?

10:00.210 --> 10:02.710
You guys should work out
whatever it is you're
working out.

10:02.710 --> 10:04.040
We can go with Fred,
right, Go Go?

10:04.040 --> 10:06.210
How else would I want
to spend my free time?

10:06.210 --> 10:07.920
Thanks, Go Go.
Man, you're the best.

10:07.920 --> 10:09.120
You will not regret it.

10:09.120 --> 10:11.330
The night was dark...

10:11.330 --> 10:13.420
I regret it.

10:13.420 --> 10:15.920
...but what was even darker
was the thought of a world
without Noodle Burger Boy.

10:15.920 --> 10:18.080
No sign of Noodle Burger Boy.

10:18.080 --> 10:19.830
It may be time
to call it a night, Fred.

10:19.830 --> 10:21.080
But we can't give up.

10:21.080 --> 10:23.250
This was his
last known location.

10:23.250 --> 10:25.120
There has to be a clue
around here somewhere.

10:25.120 --> 10:26.830
Anything! Footprint,

10:26.830 --> 10:29.000
a piece of clothing,
a strand of hair,

10:29.000 --> 10:31.880
which, you know,
thinking about it,
I guess that would be lettuce.

10:31.880 --> 10:33.880
Gee whiz, mister...

10:36.000 --> 10:39.040
How about Noodle Burger Boy
showing up in person?

10:39.040 --> 10:41.170
Well, yeah,
that's more than a clue,

10:41.170 --> 10:44.000
but I like the positive thinking
Noodle Burger Boy.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.750
Wait a minute, if you're here,

10:46.750 --> 10:49.000
then that means... you're here!

10:49.000 --> 10:50.920
Howdy and hello!

10:50.920 --> 10:53.540
-Golly, look over there, mister!
-What? Where?

10:53.540 --> 10:54.960
Crunchy style!

10:54.960 --> 10:57.080
-Whoa!
-No!

10:57.080 --> 10:58.500
Hee-hee.

10:58.500 --> 11:00.000
Hee-hee.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.250
Hee-hee.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.170
(screaming)

11:05.170 --> 11:06.250
Freddy!

11:07.620 --> 11:10.460
Noodle Burger Boy,
how could you?

11:10.460 --> 11:13.040
Gee whiz, miss,
it was awful easy.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.540
I just kicked him!

11:14.540 --> 11:16.580
Yeah, we got that part. Why?

11:16.580 --> 11:18.120
Well, golly,

11:18.120 --> 11:20.420
because I'm programmed
to collect information
and adapt,

11:20.420 --> 11:23.000
so I adapted
to the evil style,

11:23.000 --> 11:24.540
with all the fixings!

11:24.540 --> 11:26.880
-Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.
-Well, adapt this!

11:26.880 --> 11:29.040
Looks like your
usual order, miss!

11:29.040 --> 11:30.920
Take that!

11:30.920 --> 11:33.750
You can't beat
Noodle Burger Boy.

11:33.750 --> 11:35.120
He can predict every move.

11:35.120 --> 11:36.460
Predict this!

11:37.500 --> 11:38.500
Ah!

11:39.500 --> 11:40.580
Ah! Ahhh!

11:40.580 --> 11:42.460
Thank you!
Come again!

11:44.420 --> 11:47.120
Would you stop throwing people
off the roof? Come on!

11:47.120 --> 11:49.000
If you are not happy
with your service,

11:49.000 --> 11:51.210
please fill out a comment card.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.500
I'd love to hear from ya!

11:52.500 --> 11:54.170
Hear this!

11:54.170 --> 11:56.000
Feel... the... flavor!

11:56.000 --> 11:57.880
Ugh! Ketchup?

11:57.880 --> 11:59.420
And mustard.

11:59.420 --> 12:01.750
Say hello to Noodle Burger,
then say goodbye
to the hungries!

12:01.750 --> 12:04.540
Noodle Burger Boy,
where is all this anger
coming from?

12:04.540 --> 12:06.880
Ah, ah, ah!
Why won't you surrender?

12:06.880 --> 12:09.380
Gosh, I can predict
your moves,

12:09.380 --> 12:11.170
but I cannot defeat you,

12:11.170 --> 12:15.040
unless I upgrade to...
combo size!

12:19.580 --> 12:21.170
Aw, man.

12:21.170 --> 12:24.040
I always wanted to make
a daring go-kart escape.

12:24.040 --> 12:26.250
And his go-kart
had racing stripes!

12:26.250 --> 12:27.880
So cool!

12:29.250 --> 12:31.170
And evil, yes.

12:31.170 --> 12:33.210
I forgot to add evil.

12:33.210 --> 12:35.120
If we're gonna beat
Noodle Burger Boy,

12:35.120 --> 12:37.580
we need more information
about how he works.

12:37.580 --> 12:40.830
I already called the manager
at Noodle Burger. She doesn't
know where he was made.

12:40.830 --> 12:43.000
Wait, I have a clue.
He left a footprint...

12:43.000 --> 12:45.210
on my butt.

12:45.210 --> 12:47.960
-Whoa.
-Hmm. Thats the Krei Tech logo.

12:47.960 --> 12:50.500
Which can only mean
one thing...

12:50.500 --> 12:52.920
Krei makes shoes, you guys.

12:54.250 --> 12:57.500
Or Krei made
Noodle Burger Boy.

12:59.080 --> 13:00.250
Okay, good.

13:00.250 --> 13:03.080
So that's two very strong
possibilities.

13:03.080 --> 13:06.080
Wasabi and I will withdraw
from the space junk competition.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.750
-This is more important.
-Don't worry, we can handle it.

13:08.750 --> 13:11.620
Are you sure?
I think it might be better
if Hiro and I go.

13:11.620 --> 13:14.420
-Not that we don't love
working together.
-A lot.

13:14.420 --> 13:16.120
Ooh, that sounded
a little forced.

13:16.120 --> 13:17.540
Are you guys
still clashing?

13:17.540 --> 13:19.120
You can fix that
by just calling each other

13:19.120 --> 13:21.250
before you get dressed
in the morning.
It's very easy.

13:21.250 --> 13:23.120
We just have different
ways of doing things.

13:23.120 --> 13:26.880
Yeah. One of us is right,
and the other is wrong.

13:26.880 --> 13:28.830
One of us
is super controlling,

13:28.830 --> 13:30.460
and the other
goes with the flow.

13:30.460 --> 13:33.290
Well, one of us
acts like a civilized
human being,

13:33.290 --> 13:35.830
and the other acts like...

13:35.830 --> 13:38.710
an uncivilized
human being. So...

13:38.710 --> 13:40.830
One of us is good at insults
and the other is terrible.

13:40.830 --> 13:42.170
Whoa!
Come on, come on! Whoa!

13:42.170 --> 13:44.960
-This is getting too personal.
-No, that last one was fair.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.460
Here's how
this is gonna go.

13:46.460 --> 13:48.540
You guys are gonna find a way
to work together

13:48.540 --> 13:50.210
because you're dear friends

13:50.210 --> 13:52.000
who care about each other.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.080
Got it?

13:53.080 --> 13:55.040
-I'm good with that.
-Me too.

13:59.330 --> 14:02.330
The others are right.
Friends should be able
to work together.

14:02.330 --> 14:03.710
Maybe we're just
too different.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.830
One key to understanding
another person

14:05.830 --> 14:08.540
is to try to see things
from his perspective.

14:08.540 --> 14:10.170
I guess we could try that.

14:10.170 --> 14:13.290
Or we could just
split up the work
and do our parts separately.

14:13.290 --> 14:14.790
I like where
you're going with this.

14:14.790 --> 14:17.750
My way works for me,
and your way works for you.

14:17.750 --> 14:19.330
Why mess up a good thing?

14:19.330 --> 14:22.330
Avoiding a problem
means it could recur
in the future.

14:22.330 --> 14:24.000
Luckily,
we're in the present.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.540
Let's do this...

14:25.540 --> 14:27.210
not together!

14:27.210 --> 14:29.170
♪ ♪

14:46.420 --> 14:47.460
Nice!

14:47.460 --> 14:50.290
I think this is gonna work!

14:50.290 --> 14:52.960
Sorry! I just ate
an almond butter
and jelly sandwich.

14:52.960 --> 14:55.290
Hiro has a mild
peanut allergy.

14:55.290 --> 14:58.080
Now all we have to do
is test it on some real junk
at the dump.

14:58.080 --> 15:00.210
The dump? Yeah...

15:00.210 --> 15:02.460
sounds... fun.

15:02.460 --> 15:05.210
-Uh, you don't have to go.
-No, no, I'll go.

15:05.210 --> 15:07.880
Doing things apart
together worked out,

15:07.880 --> 15:10.960
let's try finishing up
together apart.

15:10.960 --> 15:12.380
Krei:
Noodle Burger
asked us to build

15:12.380 --> 15:15.290
the ultimate nostalgic
robot boy mascot,

15:15.290 --> 15:16.880
and that's what we did.

15:16.880 --> 15:19.580
Ah! He makes me wish
I was an old-timey boy.

15:19.580 --> 15:22.330
Is he made out of
military-grade titanium?

15:22.330 --> 15:24.420
Well... funny story.

15:24.420 --> 15:27.290
The inner mechanism
is from an abandoned
robot soldier project.

15:27.290 --> 15:29.000
It was taking up space
in R&D.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.120
So that means,
in addition to being able

15:31.120 --> 15:32.750
to predict
our every move, he's--

15:32.750 --> 15:34.710
Indestructible, yes, yes.

15:34.710 --> 15:37.420
But adorable.
You can't fight that smile.

15:37.420 --> 15:39.380
I can't believe
I gave my heart
to Noodle Burger,

15:39.380 --> 15:41.460
and now its boy
is going to destroy me.

15:41.460 --> 15:43.460
Yeah, that's a tough break.

15:43.460 --> 15:45.000
Anyway, if that's it,

15:45.000 --> 15:47.420
you can... leave.

15:47.420 --> 15:49.790
(mechanical whirring)

15:49.790 --> 15:51.380
(squawks)

15:51.380 --> 15:54.120
Howdy and hello, mister!

15:54.120 --> 15:55.420
I'm here to upgrade,

15:55.420 --> 15:57.250
so I can defeat
my mortal enemies,

15:57.250 --> 15:58.620
Big Hero 6.

15:58.620 --> 16:01.920
Want some stickers?
They're the coolest.

16:01.920 --> 16:04.000
Have a swell day, mister!

16:04.000 --> 16:05.250
(squawks)

16:05.250 --> 16:07.880
Hiro:
All right, well, I think
that's the last of it.

16:07.880 --> 16:09.500
Wasabi:
Hang on, let me check
the connection.

16:09.500 --> 16:11.290
Ooh...

16:11.290 --> 16:15.120
that meal comes
with a free toy.

16:17.290 --> 16:19.920
-Okay, let's see what
this thing can do.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:19.920 --> 16:21.330
You're putting it on
all wrong.

16:21.330 --> 16:22.670
You want to start
with the waist strap.

16:22.670 --> 16:24.380
It doesn't matter
what you start with.

16:24.380 --> 16:26.830
(mocking laughter)
I'm gonna pretend
you didn't say that. Here.

16:26.830 --> 16:29.880
No way!
I built the robotic skeleture,
I'm testing it.

16:29.880 --> 16:32.620
-Perhaps you--
-Hold on, Baymax.
This is between me and Wasabi.

16:32.620 --> 16:34.500
But there is a problem.

16:34.500 --> 16:36.290
Yeah, a big problem: you.

16:36.290 --> 16:37.920
Uh, what's that
supposed to mean?

16:37.920 --> 16:40.210
It means everything's
by the seat of your pants.

16:40.210 --> 16:41.420
You don't follow procedures.

16:41.420 --> 16:44.080
You don't follow procedures,
you obsess about procedures.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.670
Like that's a bad thing?

16:45.670 --> 16:47.380
You know what?
Forget it, I'm done.

16:47.380 --> 16:49.790
Working on this project
was a bad idea.

16:49.790 --> 16:52.460
Fine! You don't want
to work on it anymore?
Neither do I.

16:52.460 --> 16:53.880
Baymax:
There is a problem.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.290
We know there's a problem,
Baymax, that's why
we're arguing.

16:56.290 --> 16:58.080
That is the problem.

16:58.080 --> 16:59.670
Baymax!
(grunting)

17:02.170 --> 17:03.960
Noodle Burger Boy:
Howdy and hello!

17:03.960 --> 17:06.670
Thanks for the swell
gizmo, misters!

17:06.670 --> 17:08.290
Golly, what does this do?

17:09.960 --> 17:11.460
Ahh! Run!

17:12.460 --> 17:13.920
Ah! Ah!

17:13.920 --> 17:15.540
We have to go back
for Baymax!

17:15.540 --> 17:17.540
We will, but not like this.

17:17.540 --> 17:18.710
We need our armor!

17:18.710 --> 17:21.040
You can't beat
Noodle Burger Boy!

17:21.040 --> 17:22.670
Hee-hee! Hee-hee!

17:22.670 --> 17:24.040
Hee-hee!

17:26.460 --> 17:28.080
Noodle Burger Boy's
at the dump.

17:28.080 --> 17:30.330
He took our mech suit
and now he's got Baymax!

17:30.330 --> 17:32.380
Hiro and I are going back
to the lab to get our armor.

17:32.380 --> 17:33.620
We've got our suits.
We're on our way!

17:33.620 --> 17:36.540
Noodle Burger Boy's
at the dump. Let's go!

17:36.540 --> 17:38.250
I fail to see
how this makes you

17:38.250 --> 17:40.670
a better customer happiness
representative.

17:40.670 --> 17:42.540
That was my old job.
My new owner

17:42.540 --> 17:45.540
reprogrammed me
to destroy Big Hero 6!

17:45.540 --> 17:48.330
Robots are designed
to help humans.

17:48.330 --> 17:51.250
Golly, mister,
it looks like you're
the one who needs help.

17:51.250 --> 17:53.330
Big Hero 6
will be here any minute

17:53.330 --> 17:54.670
to try to rescue you.

17:54.670 --> 17:56.830
Too bad I'm going
to destroy them.

17:56.830 --> 17:58.330
Sticker?

17:59.540 --> 18:01.670
-Look, Hiro...
-Sorry?

18:01.670 --> 18:03.580
Yeah, me too.

18:03.580 --> 18:06.380
Maybe Baymax
was right... again.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.080
Wasabi, wait!

18:10.080 --> 18:12.330
Yeah, I think I just had
the same idea!

18:15.420 --> 18:18.290
Gee whiz, mister,
keep trying to escape,

18:18.290 --> 18:21.330
and I'll deep-fry you,
extra crunchy style!

18:21.330 --> 18:23.120
Deep-fry this!

18:26.420 --> 18:28.460
(grunts)

18:28.460 --> 18:30.710
Fred: I always wanted to dive
to save someone like this!

18:36.500 --> 18:37.540
Ya!

18:38.540 --> 18:41.540
Golly, miss.
So predictable.

18:41.540 --> 18:43.750
-What do we do?
-You try to--

18:43.750 --> 18:46.620
...short out my suit with
one of your chem balls, while
she skates around me real fast

18:46.620 --> 18:48.380
and hits me
with one of her discs.

18:48.380 --> 18:50.670
Or I could suggest
a new order.

18:50.670 --> 18:52.790
-Clean up on table five!
-Hey!

18:53.790 --> 18:56.170
Hee-hee-hee!
I do swell, well!

18:56.170 --> 18:57.420
Fred:
We will beat you!

18:57.420 --> 18:59.250
Our friends will be here
to save us.

18:59.250 --> 19:01.290
I know everything
they are going to do, too.

19:01.290 --> 19:03.330
That's the Noodle Burger Boy
guarantee!

19:03.330 --> 19:06.000
Hiro:
Hey! You might wanna
rethink that.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.580
Yeah! We'd like
to place an order...

19:08.580 --> 19:11.000
for payback.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.920
Gee whiz, something changed!

19:12.920 --> 19:14.750
My algorithm is out of whack.

19:14.750 --> 19:16.620
I cannot predict
what you will do.

19:16.620 --> 19:19.170
So, I guess I'll just have
to beat you with brute force.

19:19.170 --> 19:20.460
Hee-hee! Hee-hee!

19:22.000 --> 19:24.250
(screams)

19:24.250 --> 19:25.790
I bet you didn't
see that coming.

19:25.790 --> 19:26.880
(grunts)

19:26.880 --> 19:29.040
Golly, mister, I did not!

19:29.040 --> 19:31.790
You're really starting
to grill my bun!

19:31.790 --> 19:33.620
The mech suit's
working really great!

19:33.620 --> 19:35.500
Yeah, nice job
with the blasters!

19:39.120 --> 19:40.460
Hello.

19:40.460 --> 19:42.830
Oh, hi, Baymax.
Don't worry. We'll get you
out of there real soon.

19:42.830 --> 19:44.710
That is not swell,
mister!

19:44.710 --> 19:46.500
Not swell at all!

19:46.500 --> 19:47.540
(Wasabi screams)

19:51.000 --> 19:54.580
Hey, there.
Let me tell you about
our new menu item...

19:54.580 --> 19:55.580
chop suey!

19:57.000 --> 19:58.040
(grunting)

20:01.120 --> 20:02.620
Aah!

20:02.620 --> 20:03.830
(groaning)

20:07.880 --> 20:09.540
Gee whiz, golly,
howdy and hello!

20:09.540 --> 20:11.170
Howdy and hello this!

20:12.540 --> 20:14.330
Is this to go? Is this to go?
Is this to go?

20:16.080 --> 20:19.000
Oh, come on, Go Go.
You need a new battle cry.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.960
The whole "blank this" thing
is getting a little repetitive.

20:24.620 --> 20:26.960
-Nice going, Wasabi.
-You, too, little man!

20:27.960 --> 20:30.210
-Hiro.
-I know, Baymax,

20:30.210 --> 20:32.580
you were right all along.
I'll listen next time.

20:32.580 --> 20:34.920
Noodle Burger Boy
is getting away.

20:34.920 --> 20:36.120
(engine revving)

20:36.120 --> 20:38.710
Yeah! Woo! Get you!

20:38.710 --> 20:40.170
Ugh, gross.

20:40.170 --> 20:42.120
Yeah, but love that go-kart.

20:42.120 --> 20:44.250
(slurps)
Mmm...

20:44.250 --> 20:47.040
And so, using the combination
of a high-capacity net...

20:47.040 --> 20:48.580
Hey, watch it!

20:48.580 --> 20:50.120
Sorry!

20:50.120 --> 20:51.750
...and plasma
particle blaster...

20:51.750 --> 20:53.540
...astronauts will be able
to collect space junk...

20:53.540 --> 20:55.210
...cleaning up the cosmos,

20:55.210 --> 20:57.500
'cause nobody likes
a messy cosmos!

20:57.500 --> 20:58.880
Or is that just me?

20:58.880 --> 21:00.250
Nice teamwork.

21:00.250 --> 21:02.290
Gentlemen, good work.

21:05.750 --> 21:08.000
Howdy and hello.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.920
I'm awful sorry, mister.

21:09.920 --> 21:12.620
I totally
messed up your order.

21:12.620 --> 21:15.250
Did you collect
all the information
I requested?

21:15.250 --> 21:18.580
Golly, I... I sure did, mister.

21:18.580 --> 21:20.000
Well then,
I'd say you did

21:20.000 --> 21:22.580
just... fine.

21:22.580 --> 21:25.460
Your database should help
fill in a few gaps.

21:25.460 --> 21:27.670
(beeping)

21:27.670 --> 21:29.750
(laughing)

21:29.750 --> 21:31.620
Big Hero 6,

21:31.620 --> 21:33.960
so nice to get to know you.

21:37.290 --> 21:39.460
(theme music playing)
