00:00.010 --> 00:01.990
Previously on "The Purge"...

00:02.000 --> 00:04.640
Now, tell me where she
is, no more bullshit.

00:04.680 --> 00:08.000
I will be your guide into the Invisible.

00:08.080 --> 00:10.940
Tonight our departures
will have real meaning.

00:10.980 --> 00:13.550
Ryker Moore Equity is safer
than our homes tonight,

00:13.560 --> 00:15.909
so let's put the Purge out of our minds

00:15.910 --> 00:18.800
so we can all focus on
work... nothing else.

00:18.820 --> 00:20.060
There's no turning back.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.299
You can follow my progress live
through the app you downloaded.

00:22.300 --> 00:23.340
You're third tonight.

00:23.420 --> 00:25.159
We're making a deal with the devil.

00:25.160 --> 00:27.199
We are taking the devil's money,

00:27.200 --> 00:28.910
and we're gonna do great things with it.

00:28.920 --> 00:30.039
I know who you're looking for,

00:30.040 --> 00:31.139
and I know where you need to go,

00:31.140 --> 00:32.340
but you ain't gonna like it.

00:32.400 --> 00:35.409
- Where's my sister right now?
- She's being Purged upon.

00:55.180 --> 00:57.680
What is America?

00:58.510 --> 01:02.880
America is, we've been told,
the land of the free.

01:04.610 --> 01:06.160
So tell me, then,

01:06.240 --> 01:09.240
what is more American than the Purge?

01:11.610 --> 01:13.709
Nothing.

01:15.140 --> 01:18.680
The Purge is the ultimate
night of freedom.

01:20.910 --> 01:24.740
On Purge night, you're free
to do whatever you want...

01:24.840 --> 01:28.200
with no law, no person,

01:28.280 --> 01:31.919
no governing body
dictating your behavior.

01:41.880 --> 01:45.710
On Purge night, America
lives up to its promise.

01:47.500 --> 01:50.409
So how will you use this freedom?

01:52.880 --> 01:55.480
Will you right some wrongs?

01:55.840 --> 01:57.939
Will you heal?

01:57.940 --> 01:59.460
Will you hurt?

02:01.140 --> 02:03.440
Will you give life?

02:03.840 --> 02:05.980
Will you take life?

02:08.479 --> 02:12.260
Just don't let yourself
or your country down.

02:13.060 --> 02:17.140
The Purge is America.

02:18.300 --> 02:21.570
So be an American and Purge.

02:25.280 --> 02:26.670
No contact from this point on.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.080
You'll get a text when it's done.

02:28.220 --> 02:30.300
Okay.

02:32.340 --> 02:34.270
Take him down!

02:34.280 --> 02:35.479
Ah!

02:40.910 --> 02:42.640
God. Oh, my God.

02:58.380 --> 03:00.639
She sure knows how to
make an entrance, huh?

03:02.980 --> 03:05.780
Hey... You good?

03:05.800 --> 03:07.560
I'm fine.

03:07.640 --> 03:09.160
Think she's okay?

03:10.040 --> 03:11.970
Well, she looks better.

03:11.980 --> 03:14.120
So you don't think we have to worry?

03:16.080 --> 03:18.810
Hey, are you sure you're good?

03:20.610 --> 03:22.009
Yeah.

03:22.010 --> 03:23.880
I'm here to get our
financing, that's it.

03:24.440 --> 03:26.699
Let me find a corner and
wait for the sirens to blare.

03:26.700 --> 03:28.080
- Deal?
- Deal.

03:28.160 --> 03:31.500
- Rick.
- Speaking of which... Stanton.

03:33.700 --> 03:34.760
Game time.

03:36.380 --> 03:38.079
- Love you.
- Love you.

03:38.080 --> 03:40.160
- Go get 'em.
- Yeah. Hang tight.

03:41.680 --> 03:42.809
Hi.

03:42.810 --> 03:43.939
How are you?

03:43.940 --> 03:45.409
I'm great.

03:45.410 --> 03:47.080
- You look amazing.
- Oh...

03:47.180 --> 03:49.440
Tell me, Tanzania... how was it?

03:49.450 --> 03:51.919
It was so great. I loved the food.

03:51.920 --> 03:53.980
I got to travel. Even went on a little

03:53.990 --> 03:56.040
safari before I came back.

03:56.060 --> 03:57.599
And you're helping build a school,

03:57.600 --> 03:58.709
I think your mom said?

03:58.710 --> 04:00.439
- We start in the fall.
- Fantastic.

04:00.440 --> 04:01.539
Yeah.

04:01.540 --> 04:02.939
And what about your love life?

04:02.940 --> 04:04.320
Dating anyone?

04:04.540 --> 04:06.379
- Here and there.
- Mm.

04:06.380 --> 04:10.250
Well, there are a few eligible
bachelors walking around.

04:10.260 --> 04:11.560
I'd love to introduce you.

04:11.610 --> 04:12.759
That would be great.

04:12.760 --> 04:14.300
I'd love to meet them.

04:14.340 --> 04:16.379
Oh, it was so nice seeing you.

04:16.380 --> 04:17.809
- You too.
- Have fun.

04:17.810 --> 04:19.540
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

04:21.540 --> 04:22.909
Oh, hi.

04:22.910 --> 04:24.909
Ah, so nice to see you.

04:37.010 --> 04:38.320
What the hell?

04:45.080 --> 04:46.600
Jesus.

04:49.880 --> 04:53.080
Man... crazy sons of bitches.

05:14.840 --> 05:16.440
Shit.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.060
I'm just here to help.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.009
How many times he been hit?

05:44.010 --> 05:45.209
Two, it looks like.

05:45.210 --> 05:46.720
Uh, yeah. Two, right?

05:46.860 --> 05:49.580
- Are you a paramedic?
- No, I'm a Marine.

05:49.710 --> 05:51.820
- You been overseas?
- Just got back.

05:51.880 --> 05:54.059
So, uh, you've seen a
few people shot, I bet.

05:54.060 --> 05:55.799
We usually work at staging areas.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.630
They're saying this will be
the worst Purge night ever,

05:57.640 --> 05:58.640
since it's so warm.

05:59.240 --> 06:01.440
All right, two entry wounds... here.

06:01.780 --> 06:03.220
Two exit...

06:03.320 --> 06:04.639
Both clean through meat.

06:04.640 --> 06:06.400
There's a third one right here.

06:06.440 --> 06:08.739
That bullet is doing
the real dirty work.

06:08.740 --> 06:10.939
Pack this wound, give him some blood.

06:10.940 --> 06:12.360
- He'll probably make it.
- Thanks.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.240
Happens all the time in firefights.

06:14.280 --> 06:16.509
It's always the wound you
don't see that will kill you.

06:16.510 --> 06:17.909
Hey, you want to run with us tonight?

06:17.910 --> 06:19.400
We could use another set of hands.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.139
Especially someone who
knows what they're doing.

06:21.140 --> 06:23.809
I mean, we took a course,
but on... on real days,

06:23.810 --> 06:26.070
I'm a claims adjustor,
she's a history teacher.

06:26.080 --> 06:28.200
Can't. I need to find my sister.

06:28.340 --> 06:29.700
She's on this crazy blue bus.

06:29.720 --> 06:31.196
Have you guys seen anything like that?

06:31.220 --> 06:32.230
No, man, no bus.

06:32.240 --> 06:34.879
Uh, we saw a-a garbage
truck and, uh, no shit,

06:34.880 --> 06:36.299
a goddamn horse and buggy.

06:38.460 --> 06:40.240
Death to the NFFA!

06:42.140 --> 06:44.520
You'll be safe with
us. We're off-limits.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.340
Unwritten Purge law.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.609
Amazes me that any rule
holds on this night.

06:48.610 --> 06:50.360
The Purge notwithstanding,

06:50.420 --> 06:52.680
the natural human bent is toward order.

06:52.700 --> 06:53.739
In the absence of that,

06:53.740 --> 06:55.179
people find ways to pay homage.

06:57.610 --> 06:58.870
You want to find that bus,

06:58.880 --> 07:00.480
you should talk to Pete the Cop.

07:00.520 --> 07:01.860
Cops don't work on Purge.

07:06.610 --> 07:08.039
Pete's a flop cop.

07:08.040 --> 07:09.770
He runs the Cantina over on Lorillard.

07:09.780 --> 07:11.700
Yeah, so, if anyone can
help you, it's Pete.

07:11.740 --> 07:13.009
He's got the whole city wired.

07:13.010 --> 07:14.639
The password is "Excelsior."

07:14.640 --> 07:16.600
You'll need it. Good luck.

07:17.150 --> 07:18.240
All right, thanks.

07:18.320 --> 07:20.170
- Stay safe.
- You too.

07:20.180 --> 07:21.280
Thanks, man.

07:26.580 --> 07:29.700
Prepare my soul. The Giving is near.

07:29.780 --> 07:31.400
The Invisible awaits.

07:31.440 --> 07:34.589
Purify my flesh. Prepare my soul.

07:34.590 --> 07:37.500
The Giving is near.
The Invisible awaits.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.950
Purify my flesh. Prepare my soul.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.960
The Giving is near.
The Invisible awaits.

07:44.020 --> 07:47.020
Purify my flesh. Prepare my soul.

07:47.040 --> 07:50.300
The Giving is near.
The Invisible awaits.

07:50.340 --> 07:53.620
Purify my flesh. Prepare my soul.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.440
Hey, did you...

09:05.660 --> 09:08.209
I leave those there to remind myself

09:08.210 --> 09:11.100
that I was once a dreamer.

09:11.140 --> 09:12.279
You drew these?

09:12.280 --> 09:14.470
I spent my 20s in Paris imagining myself

09:14.480 --> 09:16.209
the next great master.

09:16.210 --> 09:17.899
Well, these are amazing, really.

09:17.900 --> 09:20.100
And I'm not saying that
because I want the job.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.519
You're very kind, but they're
not quite good enough

09:22.520 --> 09:24.960
to pay the bills.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.040
Please, sit.

09:30.060 --> 09:31.610
It's lovely to see you again, Jane.

09:31.640 --> 09:34.560
- You too.
- Let's get right into it. Shall we?

09:34.620 --> 09:36.200
All right.

09:38.940 --> 09:43.770
You were... number one
in your class at Wharton,

09:43.780 --> 09:45.709
and you've been through three
rounds of interviews here

09:45.710 --> 09:47.140
with high marks across the board.

09:47.200 --> 09:50.020
That does not happen by accident,

09:50.040 --> 09:51.839
and that does not happen very often.

09:51.840 --> 09:53.770
I've been following your firm

09:53.780 --> 09:55.399
since I read a profile in "Forbes"

09:55.400 --> 09:56.659
back when I was an undergrad.

09:56.660 --> 09:58.379
Puff piece.

09:58.380 --> 09:59.880
Total puff piece.

09:59.920 --> 10:02.780
Dad and Malcolm were old
pals back in the day.

10:04.580 --> 10:06.260
What did you say your
dad did for a living?

10:07.240 --> 10:08.560
I didn't.

10:08.880 --> 10:11.470
We like to say here,
if you make partner,

10:11.480 --> 10:13.159
that your children will grow up

10:13.160 --> 10:14.839
very differently than you did.

10:14.840 --> 10:17.239
It's, uh, the beauty of America.

10:17.240 --> 10:19.080
Opportunity for all, right?

10:24.840 --> 10:30.139
You know, all we have
left to say here, is...

10:30.140 --> 10:31.880
welcome aboard, Jane Barbour.

10:32.940 --> 10:34.120
Thank you.

10:34.160 --> 10:35.400
Thank you, Mr. Ryker.

10:35.420 --> 10:36.840
You won't regret my hiring.

10:36.900 --> 10:39.000
Please... David.

10:39.880 --> 10:41.020
David.

10:41.120 --> 10:43.080
I'll have Alice take you down to HR.

10:44.510 --> 10:46.189
Congratulations.

10:46.190 --> 10:47.620
Thank you.

10:53.260 --> 10:54.500
Bye.

11:23.840 --> 11:26.139
I don't want to get hurt like that.

11:27.440 --> 11:28.540
The screaming.

11:29.240 --> 11:31.470
Remember what the Good Leader teaches.

11:31.480 --> 11:34.800
Pain is temporary, but
it's a necessary step

11:34.820 --> 11:36.280
on the way to the Invisible.

11:37.140 --> 11:38.580
I guess.

11:39.310 --> 11:41.939
You were there when your
parents crossed over.

11:41.940 --> 11:43.080
Did they suffer?

11:44.110 --> 11:45.509
Yes.

11:45.510 --> 11:47.409
But only because they
didn't want to die.

11:47.410 --> 11:49.560
They fought against it
instead of giving in.

11:51.040 --> 11:53.409
There was no Good Leader to guide them.

11:55.180 --> 11:57.570
I spent so long trying
to forget what happened.

11:59.040 --> 12:01.720
Losing the only people
who ever loved me.

12:02.110 --> 12:03.940
I wanted to escape.

12:04.180 --> 12:05.670
I was in so much pain,

12:05.680 --> 12:08.720
I kept trying to hurt
myself just to feel alive.

12:10.040 --> 12:12.609
Good Leader Tavis saved me,

12:12.610 --> 12:15.009
showed me the true path.

12:17.880 --> 12:20.440
What's the first thing
you'll say to your parents?

12:21.310 --> 12:23.920
That I love them...

12:23.960 --> 12:25.400
That I've missed them...

12:26.340 --> 12:29.209
and that I'm so happy to be home.

12:31.640 --> 12:33.609
So...

12:33.610 --> 12:35.800
You don't need to worry.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.039
It will all be love in the end.

12:38.040 --> 12:39.489
It is time.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.670
One among us will be chosen.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.170
Purify my flesh.

12:46.180 --> 12:48.070
Prepare my soul.

12:48.080 --> 12:49.989
The Giving is near.

12:49.990 --> 12:51.909
The Invisible awaits.

12:51.910 --> 12:55.660
Purify my flesh. Prepare my soul.

12:55.760 --> 12:59.330
The Giving is near.
The Invisible awaits.

12:59.340 --> 13:01.439
Purify my flesh.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.970
I have received a sign
from the Invisible.

13:06.680 --> 13:09.080
Melissa...

13:09.340 --> 13:11.080
Melissa, it's you.

13:12.040 --> 13:13.540
You are to leave us now

13:14.040 --> 13:16.340
and go to the place we all desire.

13:17.740 --> 13:19.039
Congratulations.

13:20.340 --> 13:22.320
I'm so happy for you.

13:24.610 --> 13:27.339
Hey, remember what awaits you

13:27.340 --> 13:29.209
and be strong, my love.

13:31.660 --> 13:34.339
We will soon arrive at the
place of your Giving.

13:40.540 --> 13:42.660
No.

13:43.210 --> 13:44.439
No.

13:44.440 --> 13:46.940
No. No.

13:47.480 --> 13:49.240
No.

14:19.210 --> 14:21.780
You're the last person I
thought I'd see tonight.

14:23.100 --> 14:24.500
That makes two of us.

14:24.980 --> 14:27.540
I figured Rick might be here.

14:27.880 --> 14:29.360
My dad likes when people show up

14:29.400 --> 14:30.840
and dance to his tune.

14:31.310 --> 14:33.309
So is that why you're back...

14:33.310 --> 14:35.840
to talk Albert into
funding a new project?

14:37.000 --> 14:39.580
If we can both make the
world a safer place

14:39.600 --> 14:41.880
with my dad's money, why not?

14:42.700 --> 14:43.720
Amen to that.

14:47.640 --> 14:49.219
You look happy.

14:50.860 --> 14:52.040
Ah...

14:56.740 --> 14:58.240
Is that soda water?

14:58.320 --> 14:59.570
I'm pacing myself.

14:59.580 --> 15:02.460
Yeah, well, I'm not. Thank you.

15:02.780 --> 15:04.880
So your trip sounded nice.

15:06.440 --> 15:08.470
Yeah.

15:08.660 --> 15:10.240
You would love Tanzania.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.539
Well...

15:14.080 --> 15:16.260
I'm glad you made it back in one piece.

15:19.420 --> 15:22.360
- Hey...
- Sorry.

15:23.180 --> 15:26.340
Listen, um, I'm really okay.

15:27.680 --> 15:30.610
All that stuff... forget about it.

15:33.360 --> 15:35.580
I want to be all about the future.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.480
My dad will take care of you.

15:43.880 --> 15:45.840
I put in a good word.

15:47.480 --> 15:51.180
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:52.180 --> 15:53.809
Now, relax.

15:53.810 --> 15:55.660
You're at a party.

16:07.540 --> 16:09.379
The whole thing?

16:09.380 --> 16:11.620
It was ridiculous.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.190
Hey, where have you been?

16:15.200 --> 16:16.240
Is everything okay?

16:16.260 --> 16:19.139
I'm fine. I'm glad to see the
two of you collaborating.

16:19.140 --> 16:20.250
But can we get back to work?

16:20.260 --> 16:22.100
This needs to get done, pronto.

16:22.580 --> 16:23.910
Right.

16:24.260 --> 16:26.300
What does David always say?

16:26.340 --> 16:28.660
Surrender the "me" for the "we."

16:31.220 --> 16:33.460
So who's your pick... Mark or Alison?

16:33.500 --> 16:35.759
They're both strong. Alison is due.

16:35.760 --> 16:36.870
I agree.

16:37.140 --> 16:38.880
You've trained them both so well.

16:39.440 --> 16:40.939
Thank you.

16:40.940 --> 16:43.360
I'm glad we finally had
a chance to sit down.

16:43.380 --> 16:44.500
I've been wanting to talk to you

16:44.510 --> 16:46.060
about what's next for Jane Barbour.

16:46.340 --> 16:49.380
Okay. I'd like that.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.070
We're talking partner, Jane.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.880
It's okay to smile just a little bit.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.720
There it is.

16:58.380 --> 16:59.380
Hey.

16:59.640 --> 17:01.620
Uh, the Snyder Robbins deal closed...

17:01.680 --> 17:02.779
30 on the dollar.

17:02.780 --> 17:04.140
Great.

17:04.180 --> 17:06.150
Now I can stop dodging their calls.

17:06.160 --> 17:08.020
Yeah.

17:08.740 --> 17:11.020
Anya's killing it, don't you think?

17:11.280 --> 17:12.760
She's dedicated.

17:13.480 --> 17:15.720
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

17:21.280 --> 17:23.940
She has made some shrewd choices.

17:23.980 --> 17:25.809
I think we could all learn from her.

17:25.810 --> 17:28.020
She's obviously on the fast track.

17:29.310 --> 17:30.970
I like to keep...

17:31.380 --> 17:33.880
different options open to partnership.

17:35.460 --> 17:37.340
Okay, David.

17:37.840 --> 17:39.500
Jane?

17:40.100 --> 17:41.580
What is it?

17:41.660 --> 17:43.580
I need to catch up on my reports.

17:50.020 --> 17:51.820
_

18:17.160 --> 18:18.520
Let me see your hands!

18:25.110 --> 18:26.600
Shit.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.920
Now, asshole!

18:29.700 --> 18:31.500
- Come on, cracker head!
- Shit, shit.

18:31.540 --> 18:33.640
Come on, chico!

18:35.040 --> 18:36.520
You got three seconds.

18:43.720 --> 18:46.979
We got a contestant, boss.

18:46.980 --> 18:49.170
About goddamn time.

18:49.180 --> 18:50.939
Stand right here.

18:50.940 --> 18:52.370
What the hell are you talking about?

18:52.380 --> 18:54.140
- Contestant for what?
- It's the Gauntlet.

18:54.840 --> 18:56.540
You make it all the
way around the block,

18:56.560 --> 18:58.170
you get a prize.

18:58.180 --> 19:00.409
Apple of my ex-wife's eye.

19:00.410 --> 19:02.209
Hell of a ride, too.

19:02.210 --> 19:04.390
Of course, the Gauntlet's
a doozy this year.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.179
What Gauntlet? I'm not
doing none of this.

19:06.180 --> 19:07.799
Let me go. I need to find my sister.

19:07.800 --> 19:09.179
Fine by me.

19:09.180 --> 19:12.020
Then you will die right
here and right now.

19:13.140 --> 19:14.909
I'll be a sitting duck out there.

19:16.680 --> 19:18.360
Now he gets it.

19:19.010 --> 19:20.740
Suit him up.

19:20.860 --> 19:23.240
It's showtime.

19:23.260 --> 19:25.500
Let me go.

19:25.610 --> 19:27.600
Where it, or it wears you.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.380
Hey, kid... what's your name?

19:33.420 --> 19:35.360
Your name, amigo.

19:36.240 --> 19:37.620
Miguel Guerrero.

19:38.340 --> 19:41.259
Going live in three...

19:41.260 --> 19:44.360
two... one.

19:45.080 --> 19:48.039
Welcome, folks, to Otis' annual

19:48.040 --> 19:51.109
Purge night Gauntlet...
brought to you exclusively

19:51.110 --> 19:53.680
by Otis' Classic Car Autorama.

19:53.980 --> 19:56.940
Come in this week, mention
the Purge, get 10% off!

19:57.040 --> 19:59.639
But hurry... our inventory's liable

19:59.640 --> 20:01.900
to last about as long
as our runners here.

20:01.920 --> 20:03.770
For your viewing pleasure this evening,

20:03.780 --> 20:06.139
we guarantee you spills,
chills, and thrills.

20:06.140 --> 20:08.600
And remember, we only got two rules.

20:08.620 --> 20:10.270
Tell us what they are, Otis.

20:10.340 --> 20:13.580
Number one... we don't
accept volunteers,

20:13.600 --> 20:15.109
only live catches.

20:15.110 --> 20:17.280
And two... you live, you win.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.010
You die, you lose.

20:19.440 --> 20:21.860
Are we ready, then?

20:21.900 --> 20:23.680
- Ready.
- Let's do it.

20:23.720 --> 20:28.310
Once again... the Gauntlet... live.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.470
Run, fool!

20:35.480 --> 20:37.170
Go!

20:37.180 --> 20:38.739
Run.

20:38.740 --> 20:40.300
Run, asshole!

20:53.780 --> 20:55.220
Oh, shit.

21:06.860 --> 21:08.280
Come on!

21:11.180 --> 21:12.279
Ready!

21:20.200 --> 21:21.800
This guy's done.

21:46.080 --> 21:47.580
Trying to avoid me all night?

21:48.210 --> 21:49.550
Lila.

21:49.580 --> 21:51.370
It's great to see you.

21:51.380 --> 21:53.250
- Is it?
- Yeah, definitely.

21:53.280 --> 21:55.220
You look... good.

21:55.740 --> 21:56.839
Thanks.

21:56.840 --> 21:58.900
You clean up nicely yourself.

22:06.880 --> 22:10.280
- This is weird.
- A little.

22:10.710 --> 22:12.709
I mean, I know I've seen you naked.

22:12.710 --> 22:14.840
- And, you know...
- Jesus.

22:14.920 --> 22:16.940
- Lila...
- Come on, lighten up.

22:16.980 --> 22:18.850
Listen, what happened between us,

22:18.860 --> 22:20.520
- Jenna and I never meant...
- Stop.

22:20.880 --> 22:22.280
I get it.

22:22.780 --> 22:25.860
But if we can't just be
adults and laugh about it...

22:28.440 --> 22:29.960
Okay.

22:30.780 --> 22:32.340
So we're good?

22:32.780 --> 22:34.380
Yeah. Yeah, we're good.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.209
Great.

22:36.210 --> 22:38.450
Rick, nice meeting you.

22:38.460 --> 22:40.139
Let's get something on
the books for next week.

22:40.140 --> 22:43.140
Yeah, definitely.
I'll... I'll be in touch.

22:43.210 --> 22:45.420
Look at you.

22:46.140 --> 22:47.640
- Man of the hour here.
- Yeah.

22:49.240 --> 22:50.960
You know, I was talking
to my dad about you.

22:51.310 --> 22:52.720
He's a big fan.

22:53.240 --> 22:54.399
I'm glad to hear that.

22:55.840 --> 22:57.280
But you know what's weird?

22:57.340 --> 22:58.709
Hmm?

22:58.710 --> 23:02.060
He might make a big
investment in your company...

23:02.700 --> 23:05.080
but he doesn't really
know a thing about you.

23:05.710 --> 23:07.300
Lila...

23:07.340 --> 23:10.289
- I want to introduce you to someone.
- Okay.

23:10.290 --> 23:11.560
Nice seeing you, Rick.

23:11.880 --> 23:13.780
Good luck tonight.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.280
- Lila, this is Dawn.
- Hi, Dawn.

24:48.580 --> 24:50.199
He's done.

24:52.040 --> 24:53.400
Look at that.

25:06.810 --> 25:08.710
Line 'em up!

25:35.300 --> 25:37.980
Ladies and gentlemen, we
got ourselves a winner.

25:38.060 --> 25:40.320
Penelope Guerrero, if you can hear me,

25:40.380 --> 25:41.839
I promise I'm gonna find you.

25:41.840 --> 25:43.600
Cut that shit.

25:43.700 --> 25:45.320
Give me my damn car.

25:50.520 --> 25:52.609
The night's not over yet, man.

26:22.380 --> 26:25.200
No! No, please! No!

26:25.240 --> 26:26.880
No! No!

26:30.680 --> 26:33.039
So these parties... are they as amazing

26:33.040 --> 26:34.709
as everyone says?

26:34.710 --> 26:37.270
One thing I can say about our boss...

26:37.280 --> 26:39.700
he knows how to cut loose.

26:39.780 --> 26:41.499
These are done. Check the numbers.

26:41.500 --> 26:43.100
I'll run the last column.

26:44.680 --> 26:46.160
You know, a few people have said that

26:46.200 --> 26:48.720
Dave can be a bit, you know, forward.

26:48.760 --> 26:51.470
He's been nothing but a total gentleman.

26:53.280 --> 26:55.900
Anya... I didn't want to say anything...

26:55.960 --> 26:57.539
Ladies.

26:57.540 --> 26:59.180
I know that this is taboo these days,

26:59.240 --> 27:01.020
but Merry Christmas.

27:01.060 --> 27:02.970
Thanks, David.

27:02.980 --> 27:04.780
The carriage is leaving for the ball.

27:04.960 --> 27:07.970
Hey, have you spoken to
the guys in Houston?

27:07.980 --> 27:09.909
No. Why?

27:09.910 --> 27:12.180
About the, uh, Chan Houghton Deal.

27:12.310 --> 27:14.320
Uh, we filed it last night.

27:14.880 --> 27:16.170
The Germans just pulled out,

27:16.200 --> 27:18.479
and I need this reworked
by tomorrow morning.

27:18.480 --> 27:19.600
I'm sorry.

27:21.160 --> 27:23.300
I'll handle that. Jane has seniority.

27:24.310 --> 27:27.440
Actually, I need a more seasoned hand.

27:27.540 --> 27:29.080
Sorry, Jane.

27:29.880 --> 27:32.420
I know you'll crush it.

27:38.340 --> 27:41.410
Hey... you know you're the only one

27:41.420 --> 27:43.760
- I could trust to deal with this, right?
- Mm-hmm.

27:43.820 --> 27:47.080
- I know it stinks. I'm sorry.
- David, stop, stop.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.609
It's fine.

27:48.610 --> 27:50.200
I knew you would come through.

28:04.680 --> 28:05.780
You okay, boss?

28:05.800 --> 28:09.280
Yeah, I'm just... nervous.

28:09.420 --> 28:12.080
This deal... the
pressure's been intense.

28:12.640 --> 28:14.670
Sorry I snapped at your earlier.

28:14.680 --> 28:16.740
No, no, consider it forgotten.

28:17.110 --> 28:19.539
So that guy who works on 28...

28:19.540 --> 28:20.839
did you ever go out?

28:20.840 --> 28:22.740
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, no.

28:22.750 --> 28:24.379
Ugh, wait for it.

28:24.380 --> 28:25.839
So we go to dinner.

28:25.840 --> 28:27.360
I thought things were going great.

28:27.400 --> 28:28.639
And so we go to see a movie,

28:28.640 --> 28:30.920
and he just left me there.

28:30.940 --> 28:32.600
Like, he got up to go to the bathroom,

28:32.620 --> 28:34.010
and he never came back.

28:34.060 --> 28:36.000
- What an asshole.
- I know.

28:36.040 --> 28:38.180
Alison, you don't deserve that.

28:38.380 --> 28:40.320
But you'll find someone better.

28:40.380 --> 28:43.520
Yeah. I should Purge him.

28:44.080 --> 28:45.960
You'd Purge over a bad date?

28:46.510 --> 28:48.070
No, not really.

28:48.080 --> 28:50.300
It's just every time I
see him in the elevator,

28:50.340 --> 28:51.480
I just want to punch him.

28:51.500 --> 28:52.900
Well, it's his loss.

28:53.240 --> 28:55.000
Seriously.

28:55.640 --> 28:57.440
You know what? Let's get this done

28:57.480 --> 28:58.909
so that we can have a drink.

29:01.880 --> 29:03.260
What about you?

29:03.710 --> 29:05.809
You must have a secret wish list.

29:05.810 --> 29:07.609
- Wish list for what?
- You know.

29:07.610 --> 29:10.089
Come on, a Purge list...
all the people you wish

29:10.090 --> 29:12.700
you could take out. We all have one.

29:14.910 --> 29:17.300
I don't. I... I've never even been out

29:17.340 --> 29:18.770
on Purge night before.

29:18.780 --> 29:21.109
There's a first time for everything.

29:22.610 --> 29:24.220
I mean, what about David?

29:25.210 --> 29:27.070
What about him?

29:28.940 --> 29:30.940
We all see the way you get
passed over for partner.

29:30.960 --> 29:33.470
- It's complete bullshit.
- Oh. No.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.640
Everything happens in good time.

29:36.010 --> 29:37.260
Remember that.

29:37.300 --> 29:39.120
Uh, well, still...

29:39.280 --> 29:40.700
you could have lured him in here tonight

29:40.720 --> 29:42.000
and taken care of business.

29:45.940 --> 29:47.440
- I'm kidding.
- Oh.

29:47.450 --> 29:48.709
- Obviously.
- Okay.

29:50.710 --> 29:52.720
- We need to get this filed.
- Mm-hmm.

29:55.810 --> 29:58.300
Of course... I mean, now you don't even

29:58.360 --> 30:00.880
have to leave your
home to Purge, do you?

30:01.980 --> 30:03.759
You could just arrange for

30:03.760 --> 30:05.960
someone to do your dirty work.

30:07.580 --> 30:09.280
What are you saying, Alison?

30:09.740 --> 30:12.609
No, it's just sometimes it feels like

30:12.610 --> 30:15.239
Purging is the only answer.

30:16.910 --> 30:19.780
Maybe for some people, but...

30:21.180 --> 30:22.440
Can you run these?

30:23.110 --> 30:24.660
Yes.

30:36.540 --> 30:38.739
Sister Melissa...

30:38.740 --> 30:41.220
it is your time to Give.

30:41.320 --> 30:43.100
Come forward and offer your good-bye.

30:43.160 --> 30:44.809
No.

30:44.810 --> 30:47.380
No, I can't die. Please, God, no.

30:51.910 --> 30:54.740
Stop. I'll go.

30:54.860 --> 30:56.940
Please, Good Leader.

30:57.040 --> 31:00.760
It's okay. I'll show
you. Really, it's okay.

31:03.180 --> 31:05.809
Sister Penelope...

31:05.810 --> 31:09.340
It is very considerate
of you... kind, even.

31:09.810 --> 31:11.360
- Then let me go.
- No.

31:12.280 --> 31:13.640
It is not your turn.

31:13.760 --> 31:15.839
It has been ordained.

31:15.840 --> 31:17.539
Melissa is next.

31:20.910 --> 31:22.870
Purify her flesh.

31:22.880 --> 31:24.709
Cleanse her soul.

31:24.710 --> 31:26.199
The Giving is here.

31:26.200 --> 31:28.100
- I want to live.
- The Invisible awaits.

31:28.110 --> 31:30.140
Please, God, I want to
live. I want to live.

31:30.150 --> 31:31.450
You will, darling...

31:31.460 --> 31:33.209
Just beyond that door.

31:33.210 --> 31:34.400
- Sam...
- No!

31:34.410 --> 31:36.739
You have been chosen, my darling.

31:36.740 --> 31:38.749
- No!
- So much peace awaits you.

31:38.750 --> 31:40.840
No! No! No! I made a mistake!

31:40.850 --> 31:42.839
No! No! I don't want to die!

31:42.840 --> 31:44.609
- Purify her flesh.
- No! No!

31:44.610 --> 31:45.809
- I was wrong!
- Cleanse her soul.

31:45.810 --> 31:47.530
- I don't want to die!
- The Giving is here.

31:48.130 --> 31:50.800
Purify her flesh. Cleanse her soul.

31:50.840 --> 31:53.500
The Giving is here.
The Invisible awaits.

31:53.520 --> 31:56.580
Purify her flesh. Cleanse her soul.

31:56.600 --> 31:59.120
The Giving is here.
The Invisible awaits.

31:59.400 --> 32:01.000
Step into the Invisible.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.636
- Step into the Invisible, my child.
- Step into the Invisible.

32:03.660 --> 32:06.800
- Step into the Invisible.
- No! No! Please!

32:06.910 --> 32:08.100
No! No!

32:08.140 --> 32:09.980
Step into the Invisible.

32:10.340 --> 32:12.960
Step into the Invisible.

32:13.040 --> 32:14.329
Penelope!

32:14.330 --> 32:15.609
Help me!

32:37.320 --> 32:38.540
What's the password?

32:39.540 --> 32:40.939
Excelsior.

32:48.140 --> 32:50.110
Masks and weapons stay outside.

32:51.880 --> 32:53.440
Slowly.

32:57.560 --> 32:59.409
Check him.

33:27.280 --> 33:29.340
Excuse me.

33:30.240 --> 33:33.000
I'm looking for a guy
named Pete the Cop.

33:33.880 --> 33:35.500
Who the hell are you?

33:42.080 --> 33:43.620
Hello, young man.

33:45.240 --> 33:47.060
I'm Comonuche.

33:47.410 --> 33:49.040
Miguel.

33:49.340 --> 33:52.340
- I'm looking for Pete.
- Okay, um, Miguel.

33:52.500 --> 33:54.070
Welcome to Pete's Cantina.

33:54.300 --> 33:56.139
Only got one rule here...

33:56.140 --> 33:57.820
no politics, no violence.

33:57.860 --> 34:00.540
People go along with
that? It's the Purge.

34:00.640 --> 34:01.960
There are no rules.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.440
People respect Pete.

34:03.920 --> 34:05.819
So, when they come here,

34:05.820 --> 34:09.219
they follow Pete's rules.
He's earned it.

34:09.280 --> 34:10.520
How's that?

34:13.179 --> 34:14.199
You know what?

34:14.199 --> 34:16.179
Why don't you go ask him yourself?

34:23.610 --> 34:25.009
You Pete the Cop?

34:25.010 --> 34:26.409
Who's asking?

34:26.409 --> 34:29.280
My name's Miguel, and
I'm looking for a bus.

34:29.360 --> 34:33.539
My name's Pete... and
I don't give a shit.

35:12.610 --> 35:14.170
Bracka?

35:14.180 --> 35:15.800
Could be.

35:17.110 --> 35:19.700
I'm Jane, from the email.

35:20.610 --> 35:23.500
Okay, you're Jane from the email.

35:28.210 --> 35:29.660
Nice to meet you.

35:30.140 --> 35:32.509
Thank you for taking my case.

35:33.940 --> 35:36.139
That's what I do... take cases.

35:38.460 --> 35:40.159
And, um, the case...

35:40.160 --> 35:42.400
it's completely confidential, right?

35:42.440 --> 35:43.770
Of course.

35:43.780 --> 35:45.970
No one will find out?

35:45.980 --> 35:47.640
Not from me.

35:47.720 --> 35:49.859
And you're...

35:49.860 --> 35:52.680
You know, you've done this before?

35:55.060 --> 35:56.300
What, you need references?

35:56.780 --> 35:58.179
No.

35:58.180 --> 36:00.509
Nope.

36:00.510 --> 36:02.480
- You know the only rule.
- Right.

36:02.540 --> 36:05.260
- Once we transact, there's...
- There's no turning back.

36:05.320 --> 36:06.959
So you better be sure.

36:06.960 --> 36:08.739
Okay.

36:08.740 --> 36:10.280
Yes.

36:10.740 --> 36:12.820
I'm sure. I'm positive.

36:13.180 --> 36:16.670
It's been years... a
lifetime in the making.

36:16.680 --> 36:19.879
I mean, some slights...
they seem small at first,

36:19.880 --> 36:23.670
and then, well... they
accumulate and accrue.

36:23.680 --> 36:25.389
And I put up with it

36:25.390 --> 36:28.120
until pinpricks turn into
stabs and it becomes

36:28.140 --> 36:30.920
one long succession of bullshit

36:30.940 --> 36:33.470
and people refusing to see
you for who you are...

36:33.500 --> 36:35.899
because I no longer
recognize who I am anymore.

36:35.900 --> 36:39.109
A person can take only so much.

36:39.110 --> 36:41.580
And it's not all little things...

36:41.600 --> 36:44.179
some very major...

36:44.180 --> 36:46.400
like people making sure
you don't succeed at

36:46.420 --> 36:48.379
the level you deserve, that
you've earned outright.

36:48.380 --> 36:50.209
- It's just unbeliev...
- Look...

36:50.210 --> 36:51.960
save it for your shrink.

36:52.180 --> 36:53.720
Okay.

36:53.820 --> 36:55.499
Okay, but you need to know
that I would never...

36:55.500 --> 36:57.016
I need to know the who and the where...

36:57.040 --> 36:58.440
nothing more.

36:58.540 --> 37:01.239
The why... you can
keep that to yourself.

37:01.240 --> 37:02.440
Okay.

37:04.740 --> 37:06.709
- Okay, but it's just that...
- No "but."

37:06.710 --> 37:10.860
No, it's my right... to Purge.

37:11.240 --> 37:12.860
Okay.

37:16.080 --> 37:17.380
You crazy?

37:17.460 --> 37:19.570
You pay me here, and we both go to jail.

37:19.580 --> 37:22.239
All business is transacted the night of.

37:24.740 --> 37:25.939
Sorry. I'm...

37:25.940 --> 37:28.020
Just... I don't know what I... I'm...

37:28.080 --> 37:29.970
Hey. It's okay.

37:29.980 --> 37:31.709
I get it's your first time,

37:31.710 --> 37:33.500
but you don't have to be worried.

37:33.600 --> 37:35.170
I'm good at what I do.

37:37.940 --> 37:39.779
Thank you for that.

37:39.780 --> 37:42.239
Besides, they never expect a woman.

38:34.310 --> 38:37.560
Jesus.

38:37.660 --> 38:39.359
Oh, you scared me.

38:39.360 --> 38:41.310
Oh, I'm sorry.

38:42.440 --> 38:44.659
Just when you think this
night can't get dark enough,

38:44.660 --> 38:46.339
my parents up the ante.

38:48.060 --> 38:50.239
Maybe that's why they're still together.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.009
Why? They have a weird sense of humor?

38:52.010 --> 38:54.720
That and a sex therapist.

38:56.780 --> 38:57.900
You okay?

38:59.310 --> 39:02.070
Catalina said you weren't
feeling so well.

39:02.080 --> 39:05.100
I'm fine. Just a little stomachache.

39:05.160 --> 39:07.210
Let me see.

39:10.010 --> 39:11.280
No fever.

39:14.710 --> 39:18.070
I just hate this night.

39:18.180 --> 39:20.140
Yeah.

39:20.910 --> 39:23.360
You do seem different.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.440
You're so perfect.

39:38.380 --> 39:40.240
Lila, don't.

40:07.040 --> 40:09.170
Take what's yours.

40:09.180 --> 40:11.660
Be one with yourself.

40:13.380 --> 40:16.050
Own your time on this green earth.

40:17.480 --> 40:20.539
Use the Purge the way it was intended...

40:20.540 --> 40:23.409
to cleanse the soul of doubt...

40:23.410 --> 40:27.170
of pain, of misgiving.

40:27.180 --> 40:30.240
Make this night work for you.

40:31.940 --> 40:34.920
Now, you're gonna see some curveballs.

40:35.180 --> 40:38.800
Life has this way of
undermining your expectations.

40:38.810 --> 40:40.510
I got it.

40:41.200 --> 40:43.259
When this happens,

40:43.260 --> 40:45.260
most people roll over.

40:45.480 --> 40:47.460
Let's go.

40:47.980 --> 40:49.579
But you're not listening to me

40:49.580 --> 40:51.250
because you're interested
in the easy way.

40:51.280 --> 40:53.309
You're listening because
you've dedicated yourself

40:53.310 --> 40:55.309
to the right way.

40:57.940 --> 41:00.209
You're not gonna meet those curveballs

41:00.210 --> 41:02.439
with a cowardly flinch.

41:02.440 --> 41:03.909
You're gonna meet them

41:03.910 --> 41:07.409
with a mighty swing of your bat.

41:07.410 --> 41:09.909
A mighty swing of your bat.

41:11.440 --> 41:16.220
A mighty swing of... your... bat.
