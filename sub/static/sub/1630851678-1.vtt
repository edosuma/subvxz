[horns honking]

00:16.225 --> 00:17.559
[gasps] What the?

00:19.394 --> 00:21.230
Ah! What is that thing?

00:23.398 --> 00:24.775
What is that thing?

00:24.900 --> 00:26.109
I don't believe it.

00:26.109 --> 00:28.570
‐I'm home?
‐[honking continues]

00:28.570 --> 00:30.280
This is your world,
Anne?

00:30.280 --> 00:33.242
It's so loud.
That's because
we're on the freeway.

00:33.242 --> 00:34.409
Let's move!

00:34.493 --> 00:36.495
[all panting]

00:38.080 --> 00:40.207
[all] Whoa!

00:42.793 --> 00:44.419
Whoa! [grunts]

00:45.045 --> 00:46.088
Am I dreaming?

00:47.005 --> 00:48.674
There's only one way to be sure.

00:49.424 --> 00:50.342
[beeps]

00:56.098 --> 00:59.351
I'm home! [echoing]

01:03.730 --> 01:05.816
Lights. Lights.

01:05.816 --> 01:07.651
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.319
Oh, my gosh.
What is this thing?

01:09.319 --> 01:10.988
What are these?
[gasps]

01:11.071 --> 01:13.824
Buttons!
Buttons everywhere!

01:13.907 --> 01:14.866
[buzzing]

01:14.992 --> 01:16.868
[gasps] Yeah!

01:16.994 --> 01:19.496
Help! This dungeon smells awful!

01:19.496 --> 01:23.375
Careful, boy. There's no tellin'
what dangers lurk in this world.

01:23.375 --> 01:24.960
So, what's
our next move, Anne?

01:24.960 --> 01:27.963
I mean,
so much has happened.
Do you think Marcy‐‐

01:28.088 --> 01:30.465
She's alive, Hop Pop.
She's just gotta be.

01:30.465 --> 01:32.634
And with her and Sasha
still stuck over there,

01:32.718 --> 01:35.304
one thing's for sure:
We gotta find a way back.

01:35.304 --> 01:36.263
Yeah!
All right.

01:36.346 --> 01:37.306
Sounds like a plan.

01:37.389 --> 01:39.099
But before we do
any of that,

01:39.182 --> 01:40.434
first things first.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.393
[grunts]

01:44.313 --> 01:46.690
Anne, is this?
My house.

01:46.690 --> 01:50.694
This is really happening.
I'm gonna see my parents.

01:50.777 --> 01:54.364
So, it's too early
to call them Mom and Dad,
right?

01:54.489 --> 01:57.034
Should I call them
Mr. and Mrs. Boonchuy?

01:57.117 --> 01:59.494
Are they
tongue‐face people?

01:59.578 --> 02:03.206
Okay. You three
should probably hide in here
for the time being.

02:03.206 --> 02:06.335
I want to ease them
into all this slowly.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.837
And when the time is right,
I'll signal, "Caw caw!"

02:08.920 --> 02:11.006
Do not come out
till you hear that.

02:11.006 --> 02:12.007
[grunts]

02:14.509 --> 02:17.679
Oh! And I'm not going to
tell them I plan to go back
and stop Andrias.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.514
Or that Andrias betrayed us.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.892
Or that Marcy did
or that Sasha did.

02:21.892 --> 02:25.228
And not a word about
my weird glowing blue powers.

02:25.228 --> 02:27.064
Wow. There's a lot going on.

02:27.189 --> 02:28.732
Blue powers?
It was a thing.

02:28.857 --> 02:31.068
You can count
on us, Anne.

02:31.151 --> 02:34.237
Don't worry, Frobs.
We'll fix you up in no time.

02:34.237 --> 02:36.740
Anne's world is full
of advanced technology.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.659
[electricity crackles]

02:42.204 --> 02:43.705
[sighs]

02:43.705 --> 02:45.832
Okay. Here we go.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.214
[knocking]

02:52.214 --> 02:54.800
[knocking]
[mother] I'm coming.
I'm coming.

02:56.718 --> 02:57.886
Hi, Mom.

02:57.886 --> 02:58.887
[gasps]

02:59.721 --> 03:00.764
[giggles]

03:00.889 --> 03:03.266
What was that noise?
Everything okay?

03:03.392 --> 03:05.394
‐Dad!
‐Anne?

03:05.519 --> 03:07.562
Anne, you're back!
You're safe.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.440
‐[cat meows]
‐[gasps] Domino!

03:10.440 --> 03:12.109
Come here,
my precious baby!

03:12.234 --> 03:14.611
[meows]

03:14.611 --> 03:16.279
Where have you been?
Are you okay?

03:16.405 --> 03:17.781
Are you hurt?
Have you eaten?

03:17.781 --> 03:18.949
Your hair's a mess.

03:19.032 --> 03:22.285
It's a really,
really long story.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.121
[bird caws]

03:24.246 --> 03:25.622
[rumbling]

03:27.124 --> 03:29.292
And we're the Plantars!

03:29.292 --> 03:32.587
The lovable frog family
Anne's told you all about.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.423
Hop Pop,
that was not the signal!

03:34.548 --> 03:37.092
Well, it sure sounded
like the signal.

03:37.092 --> 03:39.428
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Anne's parents.

03:39.511 --> 03:42.097
The name's Sprig Plantar,
Anne's best friend,

03:42.097 --> 03:44.099
and walking, talking frog.

03:44.182 --> 03:45.016
[buzzing]

03:50.814 --> 03:53.483
‐Okay. Where was I?
‐The third temple?

03:53.567 --> 03:56.319
Right. So, as soon
as we charged the last stone,

03:56.319 --> 03:58.655
the music box opened the portal
that took me back to Earth.

03:58.738 --> 04:01.533
Before anything else
could happen.

04:01.533 --> 04:02.701
[laughing]

04:02.826 --> 04:05.036
But the Plantars
got sucked into
the portal too.

04:05.162 --> 04:07.873
And now they're stuck here
till we find a way
to get them home.

04:07.998 --> 04:09.666
So, yeah,
you're pretty much caught up.

04:11.460 --> 04:12.794
Hold on. Back up.

04:12.794 --> 04:15.797
You're telling us
there's a whole world
of talking frogs

04:15.922 --> 04:17.132
called "Amphibaland"?

04:17.132 --> 04:18.967
[Sprig] It's actually
called "The Amphibia."

04:19.092 --> 04:21.678
You made love
with maggots?
Was it good?

04:21.803 --> 04:23.847
This is a lot
to take in.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.766
I wish we could've
been eased into it.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.311
‐[chuckling]
‐Anyway.

04:29.436 --> 04:32.022
Can the Plantars
stay with us until
we find them a way home?

04:32.022 --> 04:34.858
[laughs]
Wait. You serious?

04:34.983 --> 04:38.028
Oh, Mom!
Dad, say something.

04:38.153 --> 04:40.030
Anne, all of this is crazy.

04:40.155 --> 04:44.201
I wouldn't believe a word of
this if the small frog
wasn't kicking me right now.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.203
New legs.
You know how it is.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.705
The adventure
is over, Anne.
You're home now.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.874
The authorities
will take care
of your friends.

04:50.957 --> 04:53.001
[gasps] What,
the police?
The government?

04:53.084 --> 04:56.671
As soon as they see
talking frogs, they'll be probed
and dissected in a secret lab

04:56.755 --> 04:58.507
and used for all kinds
of weird experiments!

04:58.590 --> 05:01.384
What's that now?
Can you elaborate
on the probing part?

05:01.510 --> 05:04.387
Anne, don't let 'em take us!
Don't let 'em take us!

05:04.387 --> 05:06.890
Don't worry, guys.
I'll keep you safe.

05:06.890 --> 05:10.393
I was living in a cave
when you found me. The least
I can do is return the favor.

05:13.730 --> 05:14.731
[sighs]

05:14.856 --> 05:18.068
Okay. They can stay... for now.

05:18.193 --> 05:19.903
Oh! Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

05:19.903 --> 05:22.739
All right.
If we're doing this,
we gotta be extra careful.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.783
No one out there
can know you exist.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.243
You're all on lockdown!

05:26.368 --> 05:28.620
You heard the man.
You're all on lockdown.

05:28.745 --> 05:31.081
Got it? What?

Family?
Should we come too?

06:49.326 --> 06:51.578
Also, do you have any more
of these candy bars?

06:52.746 --> 06:55.999
Mom, Dad, I'm really happy
to be home.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.293
I know it's a big deal
I was gone for so long,

06:58.376 --> 07:00.879
and I get that it's scary
to think about losing me again,

07:00.962 --> 07:04.174
but I need a little bit of space
or I'm gonna lose my mind.

07:04.299 --> 07:06.551
You guys are being
way too overprotective.

07:06.635 --> 07:08.553
Anne,
I think you're exaggerating.

07:08.553 --> 07:11.806
This is a big house.
We all have plenty of space
to breathe.

07:12.724 --> 07:13.808
Oops! Sorry!

07:13.933 --> 07:15.977
Just practicing
my jump kick. Hyah!

07:15.977 --> 07:17.646
Whoops! [grunts]

07:17.771 --> 07:19.022
Okay. I'm listening.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.358
We're tired of being
shut up inside.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.526
Let me and the Plantars out.
Just for an hour.

07:23.652 --> 07:26.529
I'll take care of them,
and we won't go far.

07:26.529 --> 07:27.697
Absolutely not.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.617
Oh, come on!
I can't go out alone
for an hour?

07:30.617 --> 07:34.412
Last time you went out alone,
you got trapped in another world
for five months!

07:34.412 --> 07:36.915
That is a pretty good point.
Shush!

07:37.040 --> 07:41.002
Look. Your father and I
have to go to the market.
We'll talk later.

07:41.002 --> 07:43.838
That's perfect!
Let us come.

07:43.838 --> 07:46.508
I know what you're gonna say.
We can't take the Plantars
out in public.

07:46.508 --> 07:49.344
But the market's always empty
except for a few old people.

07:49.344 --> 07:53.181
Plus, I'll make them disguises
and take full responsibility
for their safety.

07:53.181 --> 07:55.684
You think you can take care
of the whole family?

07:55.684 --> 07:59.354
No offense, Anne, but
you're the literal poster child
for hating responsibility.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.356
Just look at what
you drew as a kid.

08:03.024 --> 08:05.151
Okay, yes.
But I've changed.

08:05.235 --> 08:08.613
Look, I'm a parent too.
And I know what Anne
used to be like.

08:08.738 --> 08:11.116
So, trust me,
I get it.

08:11.116 --> 08:12.117
[Anne] Not helping.

08:12.117 --> 08:14.911
But she grew
into a town protector.

08:14.911 --> 08:20.250
A hero. Voted "Frog of the Year"
by frogs that used to hate her!

08:20.250 --> 08:22.544
Were there bumps in the road?
Sure.

08:22.669 --> 08:25.588
Did she burn the town down once?
Yeah.

08:25.714 --> 08:29.050
Did she almost get us
eaten by a large creature
numerous times?

08:29.050 --> 08:30.552
Also yes.

08:30.552 --> 08:32.387
Did she, uh...

08:33.388 --> 08:34.472
what was I sayin'?

08:34.556 --> 08:35.932
The old one's
got a point.

08:36.057 --> 08:39.602
Ever since she got back,
she has seemed
a little more mature.

08:39.728 --> 08:42.605
She used to beg me
not to take her
to the market.

08:42.731 --> 08:44.149
[clears throat]

08:44.274 --> 08:45.817
[father] Okay, Anne.
Huh?

08:45.942 --> 08:47.485
We're willing
to give it a try.

08:47.610 --> 08:48.486
[all gasp]

08:48.486 --> 08:50.655
But you stay with us
at all times.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.491
And if anything goes wrong,
it's back to lockdown.

08:53.491 --> 08:56.327
Thank you so much!
I promise you won't
regret it.

08:56.453 --> 08:58.288
[all] All right!

08:59.122 --> 09:01.583
Okay. This is gonna be a cinch.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.793
Earth is a cakewalk
compared to Amphibia.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.628
Wow! Really?

09:05.754 --> 09:08.798
Yeah, dude.
The bugs are tiny,
the birds are small,

09:08.923 --> 09:12.427
and best of all,
nothing's gonna be trying
to kill us for a change.

09:12.427 --> 09:13.887
[thunderclap]

09:18.558 --> 09:20.268
[King Andrias]
My plans are in motion.

09:20.393 --> 09:24.355
Our forces are growing,
and soon we will be ready
to invade.

09:24.355 --> 09:27.984
Only one remains
who could stand
between me and my conquest.

09:28.985 --> 09:31.154
Anne Boonchuy.

09:34.491 --> 09:36.534
She must be eliminated.

09:36.659 --> 09:39.871
This is your one objective.
[all laughing]

09:39.871 --> 09:42.082
This mission requires
the utmost discretion.

09:42.082 --> 09:45.293
We cannot allow the other world
to know of the coming invasion.

09:45.293 --> 09:47.921
Make sure no earthling sees you.

09:56.429 --> 10:00.642
And one more thing.
Would you mind picking me up
the latest Cynthia Coven book?

10:00.767 --> 10:03.186
Marcy got me hooked,
and I'm dying to know
what happens.

10:03.186 --> 10:07.190
And maybe some of those
potato chip things she had.

10:07.190 --> 10:09.526
<i>Eliminate potato chip?</i>

10:09.526 --> 10:13.196
Okay. Forget the chips.
Kill the girl.
Get the book.

10:16.533 --> 10:20.328
Well, Marcy, your friends
are about to be eliminated
from the equation.

10:20.328 --> 10:25.250
And as for you, my dear,
your part is just beginning.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.048

10:54.028 --> 10:57.699
See? You can totally use
my childhood clothes
as disguises.

10:57.782 --> 11:00.451
You really liked yellow
as a kid, huh?

11:00.577 --> 11:02.287
Won't this make us
stand out?

11:02.287 --> 11:05.582
Sprig, I'm sure
Anne knows what
she's talking about here.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.083
[both gasp]
What?

11:07.167 --> 11:09.377
If you've got it,
you've got to flaunt it.

11:09.377 --> 11:11.212
Actually, let's try
something else.

11:15.383 --> 11:16.384
[giggles]

11:21.723 --> 11:23.558
There.
That oughta do it.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.728
I like it.
My very own face bump.

11:26.811 --> 11:30.106
Hey, hey! Look at me.
I'm a human! Durp‐a‐durp!

11:30.190 --> 11:31.608
Whoa! Whoa!

11:31.691 --> 11:34.110
Wait, Polly.
You were supposed
to be the top half.

11:34.194 --> 11:37.280
And not get to use
these beautiful legs?
Never!

11:37.363 --> 11:40.283
Fair enough.
Now, who's ready
to see my world?

11:40.408 --> 11:41.618
[all] Yeah! Yeah!

11:41.743 --> 11:43.119
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

11:45.121 --> 11:46.956
Okay. But no more
victory jumps.

11:49.751 --> 11:51.544
Let's go!
[all whooping]

11:52.545 --> 11:54.255
Not so fast you three‐‐

11:54.339 --> 11:55.757
I mean, you four.

11:55.757 --> 11:57.926
We stick together in there.
Understood?

11:58.051 --> 12:01.304
And if anything goes wrong,
it's back in the lockdown
for all of you.

12:01.304 --> 12:04.098
We got it. We got it.
Now let's get shoppin'.

12:05.642 --> 12:08.770
[all clamoring]

12:10.813 --> 12:12.982
This was a bad idea,
wasn't it?

12:13.107 --> 12:14.901
Oh, yeah.

[woman on PA]
<i>Clean up on aisle six.</i>

12:20.573 --> 12:23.826
Wow! That thing
looks like Frobo.
Is that a robot too?

12:23.910 --> 12:26.162
Sort of. It's like
a robotic wallet.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.665
Cool. Oh, and is that a robot?

12:29.499 --> 12:32.418
[beeping]

12:32.418 --> 12:35.255
Sprig, not everything
is a robot.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.423
[beeping]

12:37.423 --> 12:39.592
Okay, fine.
But nothing else.

12:39.676 --> 12:42.136
Oh, no. I left
the shopping list at home.

12:42.220 --> 12:44.639
Abort mission!
Abort mission!

12:44.639 --> 12:47.308
No worries. I took a picture
of the shopping list
before we left.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.643
Just in case.

12:48.643 --> 12:50.478
Oh, thank you,
Anne.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.189
That was strangely
responsible of you.

12:53.189 --> 12:57.360
Psst. Give me a quarter.
I wanna buy a lotto ticket.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.195
You will do no such thing!

12:59.320 --> 13:02.448
[chuckling]
Such puny vegetables.

13:02.532 --> 13:05.410
Huh? Whoa!
Mama!

13:05.410 --> 13:08.413
Now, that's more like it.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.915
Oh, that's Durian.
It's a Thai favorite.

13:10.915 --> 13:13.084
It's not really my thing.
Since it smells like...

13:14.752 --> 13:16.671
‐...rotten eggs.
‐Ah!

13:26.597 --> 13:28.516
Mom, Dad,
can I take the Plantars

13:28.516 --> 13:30.852
‐to try out some noodles?
‐[both] Uh...

13:30.852 --> 13:33.021
I'll keep the Plantars
within arms' reach
at all times,

13:33.104 --> 13:36.733
will avoid any customers,
and I'll keep my phone in
my hand in case you guys call.

13:36.733 --> 13:39.861
‐But‐‐
‐And I won't order iced coffee,
even though I love it,

13:39.861 --> 13:42.572
because I know it makes me
jittery and anxious.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.073
That does
sound fair.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.908
All right, you can go.
But be careful.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.577
Yes! We will be.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.245
Thank you. Huh?

13:49.245 --> 13:50.913
‐No, you don't!
‐Huh?

13:51.039 --> 13:53.249
Nope. No, no, no, no.
Oh.

13:53.374 --> 13:56.044
Unbelievable.
She's like
a different person.

13:56.127 --> 13:57.712
Maybe old frog
was right.

13:57.712 --> 13:59.380
She has come
a long way.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.883
Now, come on.
Mama needs
her jasmine tea.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.095
Stupid door.

14:10.725 --> 14:13.102
[grunts, sighs]
Thanks, dude.

14:13.102 --> 14:15.063
I gave you a tray.

14:15.063 --> 14:17.607
All right!
Dig in, everyone.

14:17.607 --> 14:19.192
Hmm...

14:20.943 --> 14:23.279
Aah! Hey, these worms
are pretty good.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.114
And they're not
even fighting back.

14:25.114 --> 14:27.450
Pretty good?
They're delicious.

14:27.575 --> 14:29.619
Gimme!

14:30.620 --> 14:31.954

14:32.038 --> 14:34.624

They're noodles.

14:54.268 --> 14:56.562
[slurping] Aah. Hmm?

14:58.272 --> 14:59.649
Killer robot!
Huh?

15:01.484 --> 15:04.195

not everything is a‐‐

‐Guys!
‐Stop! Anne!

15:08.032 --> 15:09.242
Oh, no, you don't!

15:13.996 --> 15:15.164
Take this!

15:17.917 --> 15:18.918
Oh, boy.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.129
Everyone, run!

15:26.050 --> 15:29.053
[sighs] People go crazy
for those noodles.

15:30.138 --> 15:31.472
Did you see that thing?

15:31.472 --> 15:32.807
It's a new kind of robo!

15:32.890 --> 15:34.475
It's gotta be from Amphibia.

15:34.475 --> 15:36.477
But how did it get here?
And what does it want?

15:36.561 --> 15:39.021
Andrias must've sent it
to capture us.

15:39.105 --> 15:42.024
We have to take this thing out
before my parents notice
anything wrong‐‐

15:42.150 --> 15:43.860
Oh! [stammering]

15:43.943 --> 15:46.362
Mom, Dad! Hi!

15:46.445 --> 15:48.573
Hey, guys.
How were the noodles?

15:48.573 --> 15:50.575
So good.

15:50.700 --> 15:54.203
I was, uh, just
taking the Plantars to
help out with the shopping list.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.204
[all] Yep!

15:55.329 --> 15:57.206
Oh, that's so thoughtful.

15:57.206 --> 15:59.709
Can you also go get a mackerel
from the seafood counter.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.252
Oh, yeah! No prob.

16:01.335 --> 16:02.503
Mmm, mmm, mmm!

16:05.506 --> 16:09.218
Uh, yeah!
Gonna do that right now.
[laughing]

16:09.218 --> 16:10.887
Isn't the fish counter
the other way?

16:10.887 --> 16:13.222
Anne, can you use
your blue powers?

16:13.347 --> 16:15.057
Take it down
easy like?

16:15.057 --> 16:16.726
Powers! Powers!

16:16.851 --> 16:18.853
I would if I knew
how to use them.

16:18.853 --> 16:21.105
I'm not sure it's something
I can just do whenever.

16:21.230 --> 16:22.565
Boo!

16:22.565 --> 16:23.774
So what do we do?

16:23.774 --> 16:25.234
Won't it draw
a lot of attention

16:25.359 --> 16:28.070
if we fight a robot
in the middle of a store?

16:28.070 --> 16:29.906
Probably.
But I have a plan.

16:33.326 --> 16:38.247
[rock music playing on speakers]

16:38.247 --> 16:41.417
All right. That'll cover
any noise that we might make.
Now, come on.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.377
What?
Speak up!

16:43.461 --> 16:45.046
That music
makes me mad!

16:45.129 --> 16:46.339
Just come on!

16:48.716 --> 16:51.510
Hey, robot,
I brought you
some flour!

16:57.058 --> 16:58.059
Good thinking, Anne.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.727
Everyone, attack!

16:59.810 --> 17:01.896
[all shouting]

17:02.855 --> 17:04.982
[music continues]

17:04.982 --> 17:06.484
Hey. I love this song.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.029
Oh, yeah.
This is a classic.

17:15.284 --> 17:16.285
Yeah!

17:21.457 --> 17:22.750
[all gasp]

17:23.376 --> 17:24.961
Huh. That's weird.

17:24.961 --> 17:26.921
Looks like the robot
doesn't want to
get caught either.

17:32.093 --> 17:33.261
I got him! Oh!

17:33.344 --> 17:34.929
[grunts] Hop Pop down!

17:34.929 --> 17:35.930
Retreat!

17:35.930 --> 17:37.932
[panting]

18:00.913 --> 18:04.000
I'm getting real tired
of this guy.
Anyone got any ideas?

18:05.626 --> 18:06.669
Great.

18:06.794 --> 18:08.671
Frogs. Body temperature.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.134

[growls]

18:44.665 --> 18:45.708
[beeping]

18:46.792 --> 18:48.669
If you think I'm just
gonna sit here

18:48.794 --> 18:50.671
while you
hurt my friends,

18:50.671 --> 18:53.507
you've got another thing coming.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.483
[car alarm blaring]

19:14.820 --> 19:17.073
[groans] Huh?

19:20.660 --> 19:21.661
[sighs]

19:21.744 --> 19:22.662
[ice cracking]

19:22.745 --> 19:24.622
Anne, that was amazing!

19:24.622 --> 19:26.749
You guys weren't kidding
when you said "powers."

19:26.749 --> 19:29.543
Yeah! Do the punch again!
Anne?

19:29.669 --> 19:30.878
[groans]

19:30.878 --> 19:32.713
Anne!
Anne!

19:32.838 --> 19:34.715
Come on, Anne.
Come back.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.884
Is she okay?
She's okay.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.387
I think using those powers
takes a lot out of her.

19:39.512 --> 19:40.930
Well, we gotta do something.

19:40.930 --> 19:42.556
If her parents
see her like this...

19:42.682 --> 19:45.726
I've got an idea.
I'll be right back.

19:45.726 --> 19:48.729
And Durian to the rescue!

19:50.523 --> 19:52.775
Ah! No! Get it away!
Hop Pop?

19:52.775 --> 19:54.276
You're all right!
Oh, my God!

19:54.276 --> 19:55.277
[all cooing]

19:55.277 --> 19:56.487
[father] Hey.
There you guys are.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.489
How was your
supermarket journey?

19:58.614 --> 20:01.492
It was great.
Walking around
a boring, old supermarket,

20:01.492 --> 20:04.328
was just the thrill
we needed. [laughs]

20:04.328 --> 20:06.497
[gasp] Oh!
And here's the fish
you wanted.

20:06.497 --> 20:09.125
Oh, Thanks, Anne.
Glad you had fun.

20:09.125 --> 20:12.294
And we're sorry
for being so
overprotective earlier.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.088
Not only can you
take care of yourself,

20:14.088 --> 20:16.424
but it looked like
you can even take care
of your friends.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.759
Yes. We are actually
very impressed.

20:18.884 --> 20:21.595
Aw. Thanks, but you
don't have to apologize.

20:21.595 --> 20:24.056
You were just doing everything
you could to keep me safe...

20:25.266 --> 20:26.600
and I get it.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.437
Yeah, well,
some kid made a mess
of the cooking aisle

20:29.520 --> 20:32.940
and we just lucky to have
a daughter who would never
do something like that.

20:32.940 --> 20:33.941
[both laughing]

20:34.024 --> 20:35.443
[all laughing]

20:35.443 --> 20:39.280
[cackling]

20:39.280 --> 20:40.281
Don't overdo it.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.952
Anne, are you sure
you're okay?

20:45.035 --> 20:46.620
You didn't look too good
back there.

20:46.704 --> 20:50.291
Yeah. I'm thinking
I shouldn't use those powers
if I can help it.

20:50.291 --> 20:54.712
I don't know
how else to describe it.
But using them feels... bad.

20:54.712 --> 20:56.922
Well, we won't make you
use them again.

20:57.006 --> 20:59.633
Plus, you're sort of
taking on a lot already.

20:59.633 --> 21:00.968
What are you talking about?

21:01.093 --> 21:03.345
All I have to do
is protect you guys
and keep you a secret.

21:03.345 --> 21:06.182
And find a way to reopen
a portal to Amphibia
and return you home.

21:06.307 --> 21:08.976
And somehow defeat King Andrias
and make up with
my two best friends.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.686
And bring them back to Earth.

21:10.686 --> 21:13.397
Hmm. Okay.
It sounds like a lot.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.691
But I can do it.
I'm perfectly capable.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.402
Can someone please
open this door for me?

21:18.527 --> 21:22.072
I'm trying to move my arms,
and nothing's happening.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.533
Hey, anyone else
craving those noodles?

21:24.658 --> 21:27.536
Yep. Turns out
this world ain't half bad.

21:27.661 --> 21:30.164
Yeah. As long as
that robot never comes back,

21:30.164 --> 21:31.832
I think everything's
gonna be fine.

21:31.916 --> 21:33.793
You really gotta stop
saying stuff like that.

21:33.876 --> 21:35.002
[father]
What's for dinner?

21:35.002 --> 21:36.295
[speaking Thai]
