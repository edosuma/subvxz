nominate me in the first place?

stand up for Baltar.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.929
I didn't take this job to help
you undermine the President.

17:36.013 --> 17:37.889
I'm not asking you to.

17:38.474 --> 17:41.476
Believe it or not,
I'm on Laura's side.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.229
Okay, then
what's the problem?

17:44.313 --> 17:47.524
It's amazing the things you start to
notice when you're on the sidelines.

17:47.650 --> 17:52.320
How every decision that Laura and your
father make gets stamped "classified. "

17:52.905 --> 17:56.032
Or how her directives are
starting to read like decrees,

17:56.117 --> 17:59.327
yet still get enacted
without so much as a debate.

17:59.412 --> 18:03.832
You know, she won't even allow records
to be kept of any of her meetings.

18:04.375 --> 18:08.170
Secrecy and control are
becoming obsessions for her.

18:08.671 --> 18:12.591
I think this Demetrius business
is just the tip of the iceberg.

18:12.967 --> 18:17.429
Well, sometimes a benevolent
tyrant's exactly what you need.

18:17.513 --> 18:18.555
No.

18:19.015 --> 18:21.725
A tyrant craves power
for its own sake.

18:21.851 --> 18:25.145
And all Laura wants
is to save us all.

18:27.315 --> 18:30.192
Trust me. Better yet,
trust yourself.

18:31.402 --> 18:33.653
Because that's what
I'm really counting on.

18:33.738 --> 18:37.324
That you're not the kind of
man who can ignore the truth

18:38.701 --> 18:41.036
when it stares you
in the face.

18:57.470 --> 19:00.847
CALLY: What if you gave me a
sedative and I just slept here?

19:01.057 --> 19:02.307
Oh, sure.

19:02.391 --> 19:06.561
We'll just turn my sickbay into an opium
den so you can have a little snooze.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.397
Feels like I haven't
had a night's sleep

19:09.482 --> 19:12.150
since we reached
that frakking nebula.

19:12.610 --> 19:15.070
How are things
on the home front?

19:16.155 --> 19:19.241
You mean other than catching
my husband with another woman

19:19.325 --> 19:22.369
and having him tell me
I'm imagining things?

19:22.453 --> 19:24.454
Well, the man doesn't know
what he's got at home.

19:24.539 --> 19:26.873
He should have
his head examined.

19:26.958 --> 19:30.085
As a matter of fact, why
don't you bring him in?

19:30.711 --> 19:31.837
I'll take a look.

19:31.921 --> 19:33.046
(LAUGHS)

19:33.130 --> 19:36.508
See, that's what I like about you,
Doc. You just pretend to be a bastard.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.343
Well, while you're in
the mood for tough love,

19:38.427 --> 19:40.345
maybe you are
imagining things.

19:40.429 --> 19:45.058
You know, fatigue and antidepressants
can make a hell of a paranoia cocktail.

19:45.142 --> 19:49.104
I felt like I needed to take something
to keep from going completely crazy.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.438
You're not crazy.

19:50.523 --> 19:55.443
What would you call someone who all but
proposes to a man after he breaks her jaw?

19:58.531 --> 20:01.283
That the last time
he laid hands on you?

20:04.078 --> 20:06.788
You want to hear
something really sick?

20:07.331 --> 20:09.374
Sometimes I wish he would.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.334
Lay hands on me.

20:12.879 --> 20:16.256
At least then I'd know he
had some feelings about me.

20:17.675 --> 20:20.802
Listen, just get some sleep
and clear your head.

20:21.596 --> 20:23.096
Will do, Doc.

20:23.639 --> 20:24.973
Thank you.

20:49.540 --> 20:52.417
Kara, what the hell's
the matter with you?

20:53.628 --> 20:56.755
'Cause the way you're holing up in
here, you're making people wonder.

20:56.839 --> 21:01.051
Let them. Frankly, they're starting
to bug me as much as I bug them.

21:01.344 --> 21:02.385
Frak them.

21:02.470 --> 21:05.764
You know, some of us actually
volunteered for this mission.

21:05.848 --> 21:07.182
Some, meaning you?

21:07.266 --> 21:09.809
Is that what this is about, Sam? You
want to know what the deal is with us?

21:09.894 --> 21:11.394
With our marriage?

21:11.479 --> 21:12.771
Well, it didn't make much
sense to begin with.

21:12.855 --> 21:14.648
Makes even less now.

21:18.486 --> 21:20.153
I don't buy that.

21:21.238 --> 21:25.033
I don't think you believe a
single frakking word you're saying.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.868
You're just scared.

21:28.913 --> 21:30.330
You see that? Huh?

21:30.414 --> 21:32.457
You see this?
You remember those?

21:32.541 --> 21:34.876
Do you remember
when we got them?

21:35.002 --> 21:36.670
That's what's real. Okay,
that is part of who we are.

21:36.754 --> 21:40.465
That is a part of who you are,
whether you want to admit it or not.

21:40.549 --> 21:42.759
You dumb motherfrakker.

21:42.843 --> 21:46.596
I only married you because it
was safe and it was easy, Sam.

21:46.681 --> 21:50.058
And you were just pathetic
enough to go along with it.

21:51.143 --> 21:52.894
So get the frak out.

21:57.608 --> 22:00.068
I said get out.
Get out!

22:00.152 --> 22:02.654
What are you gonna
do, huh? Get out!

22:04.365 --> 22:06.074
(PANTING)

22:09.036 --> 22:11.162
I don't want
to fight, Sam.

22:12.415 --> 22:13.957
I want to frak.

22:15.918 --> 22:17.669
You don't get it,
do you?

22:17.753 --> 22:20.255
I'm not the same girl
you married.

22:23.259 --> 22:25.510
All I want to do
right now is frak.

22:25.594 --> 22:29.848
Really frak, like it's the end of
the world and nothing else matters.

22:30.099 --> 22:31.766
So come on, Sam.

22:32.435 --> 22:34.352
Make me feel something.

22:35.980 --> 22:37.355
I dare you.

22:53.539 --> 22:55.874
We were married,
weren't we?

22:56.751 --> 22:59.419
I mean, that wasn't
just like a fantasy.

22:59.503 --> 23:00.754
Hell, no.

23:01.130 --> 23:03.465
And I got the scars
to prove it.

23:04.133 --> 23:06.885
Does that seem different
to you somehow?

23:07.636 --> 23:09.304
Different how?

23:09.388 --> 23:10.889
Not sure.

23:12.141 --> 23:14.851
It's like everything
seems so far away.

23:15.603 --> 23:18.313
The way things feel.
The way they taste.

23:19.482 --> 23:20.440
Like I'm watching myself,

23:20.524 --> 23:23.985
but I'm not really
experiencing it, not living it.

23:26.280 --> 23:30.283
Like my body's just this alien
thing that I'm still attached to.

23:32.453 --> 23:34.621
Does that seem
crazy to you?

23:39.168 --> 23:41.127
Frankly, we were
as surprised as you are.

23:41.212 --> 23:44.047
We presented your case.
There was some debate.

23:44.131 --> 23:45.924
And we were outvoted.

23:46.217 --> 23:50.762
Our compatriots now seem to agree
that it was wrong to box the D'annas.

23:50.846 --> 23:53.098
It sounds like your own
opinion hasn't changed.

23:53.182 --> 23:56.017
I promised that we'd do
some hard thinking.

23:56.352 --> 23:59.521
But in the end, we decided
that our choices were correct.

23:59.605 --> 24:03.358
Unfortunately, restoring unity was
all the others seemed to care about.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.819
It's hard to have unity when you're
still so opposed to everything

24:05.903 --> 24:06.986
the rest of us
believe in.

24:07.071 --> 24:08.988
Look, he kept his word.

24:09.073 --> 24:10.156
You won the day.

24:10.241 --> 24:11.282
Do you think
you have the right

24:11.367 --> 24:14.327
to win our hearts and minds, too?
No, you're being presumptuous.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.871
Don't even try to compare us
to... NO. 6: They're right.

24:16.956 --> 24:21.126
If they've agreed to our terms, then there's
no point in courting any more discord.

24:21.210 --> 24:23.753
Any more discord and we
may run out of spare bodies.

your newfound heroine has to say.

to stay on our own ships.

feel comfortable here anyway.

searching for new food sources?

would you rather

Regarding the reports, the Demetrius

won't discuss it, period.

Madam President,
I have to say that

my constituency is not
satisfied with an executive...

on something as fundamental

the importance for the need for
security. Coming from the military,

26:07.816 --> 26:12.862
it's my experience that we sometimes
err too strongly on the side of caution.

26:13.155 --> 26:14.864
So for the sake of
reassuring my colleagues

26:14.949 --> 26:17.867
and hopefully putting
this matter to rest,

26:18.327 --> 26:23.456
would it not be fair to say that you

don't feel the need

appoint himself my spokesman.

Answerable only to

27:27.604 --> 27:30.732
the judges of which would
also be chosen by you.

27:30.816 --> 27:33.651
Effectively, it creates a
justice system that further

27:33.736 --> 27:37.030
and dangerously concentrates power
into the hands of the executive.

27:37.114 --> 27:39.532
Namely, into your hands,
Madam President.

27:39.616 --> 27:42.368
Far from being
independent or impartial,

27:42.911 --> 27:46.080
it would actually damage
the very idea of justice.

in progress,

are provisional.

27:56.258 --> 27:58.134
It is a first step,
a tiny step,

32:48.675 --> 32:50.801
Fine, great. We done?
Can we go?

32:50.886 --> 32:52.595
Why are you so antsy?

32:52.679 --> 32:53.721
I told Cally
I'd check on her.

32:53.805 --> 32:56.140
Well, didn't you do that
when you got my note?

32:56.224 --> 32:57.350
TYROL: I didn't get a note.
What note?

32:57.434 --> 33:01.395
The note I left in the drop in
your quarters about this meeting.

33:01.688 --> 33:04.649
Tory found me.
Did you... Oh, frak me.

33:04.733 --> 33:05.983
If Cally finds
the note, then...

33:06.068 --> 33:07.568
TIGH: Well, you better
hope she doesn't.

33:07.653 --> 33:10.529
And you better put an end
to this affair business.

33:10.614 --> 33:12.865
Whatever it takes to stop
her from nosing around.

33:12.949 --> 33:16.369
Last thing we need is for your
Cylon-hating wife to find out

33:16.453 --> 33:19.163
there's a bunch of skin jobs
running around this ship,

33:19.247 --> 33:21.791
and that her husband
is one of them.

33:40.310 --> 33:41.769
(GASPING)

34:02.624 --> 34:05.334
I'm tired of looking
at your sorry faces.

34:44.499 --> 34:46.834
(PANTING)

34:48.003 --> 34:49.837
No, no, no, no.

34:52.340 --> 34:53.924
Frak! Frak!

34:59.931 --> 35:01.474
(DOOR CLOSING)

35:05.312 --> 35:06.353
TYROL: Hey.

35:09.983 --> 35:11.484
How you doing?

35:13.069 --> 35:14.195
Fine.

35:17.657 --> 35:19.325
You feeling okay?

35:19.409 --> 35:20.826
Yeah, fine.

35:24.748 --> 35:26.040
You sure?

35:26.541 --> 35:27.958
Yeah, actually, I am.

35:28.043 --> 35:31.545
Thought I was coming down
with something, so I slept in.

35:34.382 --> 35:35.758
Did you go see Cottle?

35:35.842 --> 35:37.551
No, I'm feeling better.

35:40.013 --> 35:41.096
Good.

35:44.518 --> 35:47.561
Look, I know it's been
a rough couple of weeks.

35:48.396 --> 35:50.564
I know what
you're thinking.

35:51.566 --> 35:53.567
It's not true.
It isn't?

35:54.986 --> 35:56.028
No.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.200
I'm not having an affair.

36:01.576 --> 36:04.411
I figured it out.
I know what's important.

36:05.205 --> 36:06.831
You're important.

36:08.124 --> 36:11.752
Nicky's important.
We're important. Us.

36:12.963 --> 36:15.172
That's really what it's
all about, isn't it?

36:15.257 --> 36:18.467
Family, a future. Building
that future together.

36:19.094 --> 36:23.639
I promise you from now on
I will be here for us.

36:24.391 --> 36:27.017
The three of us.
Maybe the four of us.

36:29.437 --> 36:34.275
You know, maybe someday
we'll have another baby.

36:36.778 --> 36:38.863
What do you think?
Another baby?

36:38.947 --> 36:41.657
A brother, a sister
for little Nick?

36:44.244 --> 36:47.413
Hey? Would you like
a little brother or sister?

36:49.291 --> 36:50.291

39:10.265 --> 39:11.432
TORY: Cally.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.977
Stay the frak away from me!
I know what you are.

39:15.520 --> 39:16.770
I know what all of you are.

39:16.855 --> 39:18.022
How could you?

39:18.106 --> 39:19.231
We don't even know
what we are.

39:19.315 --> 39:23.027
I heard you. You're Cylons!
A bunch of frakking skin jobs.

39:23.153 --> 39:25.112
I wish it were that simple.

39:25.196 --> 39:26.905
Stay away from me.

39:28.366 --> 39:29.992
(NICHOLAS CRYING)

39:31.786 --> 39:35.497
Guess you better hope there's
a spare body waiting for you.

39:38.960 --> 39:40.711
You want to kill me?

39:41.004 --> 39:44.965
Go ahead. Don't do this to
yourself or to your child.

39:46.551 --> 39:47.551
To Nicky.

39:47.635 --> 39:48.969
Get the frak away!

39:49.179 --> 39:54.558
You're not getting your hands
on my son! Not you, not Galen!

39:55.310 --> 39:57.478
He frakking used me!

39:57.979 --> 40:00.647
He didn't know.
None of us did.

40:01.149 --> 40:03.025
(CRYING CONTINUES)

40:03.109 --> 40:05.027
We didn't find out
until we entered that nebula.

40:05.111 --> 40:08.864
Just shut the frak up,
traitor! Frak!

40:09.032 --> 40:11.950
All we know
is that we're Cylons.

40:12.577 --> 40:16.246
But in every other way,
we're still the same people.

40:16.331 --> 40:18.582
You're frakking machines!

40:20.919 --> 40:22.419
I don't know.

40:25.465 --> 40:27.883
But I do know
that we're not evil.

40:28.343 --> 40:30.010
We're not inhuman.

40:30.470 --> 40:34.890
And we're just as scared
and confused as you are.

40:35.225 --> 40:37.184
I can't live like this!

40:37.644 --> 40:39.728
It's a frakking nightmare.

40:40.230 --> 40:42.606
You don't want
to do this, Cally.

40:43.191 --> 40:44.691
He's your son.

40:52.575 --> 40:55.911
What have I done?
I'm so sorry. Oh, God.

40:59.332 --> 41:03.210
Nicky. It's okay.

41:04.170 --> 41:05.379
Nicky.

41:06.339 --> 41:10.384
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

41:12.929 --> 41:14.138
It's okay.

41:14.222 --> 41:15.889
We'll work this
out together.

41:15.974 --> 41:17.182
It's okay.

41:18.184 --> 41:20.060
It's okay.
Okay?
