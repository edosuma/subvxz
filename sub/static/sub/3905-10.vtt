WEBVTT

00:29.446 --> 00:30.988
- Ready?
- Yes.

00:31.156 --> 00:33.407
I carried you both. I need to see her.

00:33.450 --> 00:36.785
I don't think that nine months of gestation
entitles her to risk us all.

00:36.870 --> 00:40.873
Hey, look! Helena is my twin sister.

00:40.957 --> 00:43.125
- She has a right to know.
- Because you shared a womb?

00:43.460 --> 00:45.335
Helena is dangerous.

00:45.462 --> 00:48.630
She's had her whole world turned inside out.
Just like I have.

00:50.258 --> 00:53.719
How Helena takes this determines
what we do with her.

01:09.235 --> 01:10.694
I need to see you privately.

01:11.112 --> 01:12.154
Away from here.

01:12.781 --> 01:15.949
- What for?
- I have something for you from back then.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.035
About my in vitro treatments.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.497
Okay, I've got a place we can meet.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.085
Helena, this is Amelia.

01:26.169 --> 01:27.336
Your birth mum.

01:33.718 --> 01:37.763
Hey, look! Hey!
You listen to what she has to say!

01:37.889 --> 01:40.849
Or I'll put right back in the trunk
and I'll take you straight to Leekie.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.027
How can you be my birth mother?

01:52.153 --> 01:55.072
Helena, I am birth mother to you both.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.143
Who's here?

02:24.227 --> 02:27.479
Ah, monkey, you're not supposed to be up.

02:29.482 --> 02:30.566
What's the matter, love?

02:30.942 --> 02:33.527
I think something bad
is going to happen again.

02:35.238 --> 02:36.572
Yeah, that's what this is.

02:37.198 --> 02:40.784
A connection.
We were implanted by doctors, all of us.

02:41.661 --> 02:44.538
You split inside me into two baby girls.

02:45.331 --> 02:48.500
And I hid you because
I felt you were in danger.

02:50.253 --> 02:51.420
Sister?

02:53.965 --> 02:55.841
You're my twin sister.

02:56.467 --> 02:58.927
I don't want to be your sister, meathead!

02:59.929 --> 03:03.348
Look, I just want you to know,
you're not the original.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.934
Got it? You were born of science.

03:06.269 --> 03:10.898
Not of some immaculate womb
or whatever bullshit Tomas fed you.

03:21.826 --> 03:23.368
- This is the police!

03:23.453 --> 03:25.245
Shit! Sarah!

03:29.209 --> 03:32.419
- This is your last warning!
- Sit down. You're just visiting.

03:38.301 --> 03:41.053
- Sarah Manning, come out now!
- Sarah Manning, come out!

03:48.186 --> 03:49.603
Put your hands on your head.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.188
Turn around.

03:55.985 --> 03:58.111
Sarah Manning, you're under arrest.

04:08.748 --> 04:09.831
Let's go!

05:00.383 --> 05:01.425
Sarah.

05:03.386 --> 05:04.720
I still see Beth.

05:05.388 --> 05:06.555
I didn't kill her, Art.

05:07.974 --> 05:11.518
No, you watched her commit suicide.

05:12.228 --> 05:13.729
And then you went straight for her wallet.

05:19.235 --> 05:21.570
Beckwith finished Jane Doe's
facial reconstruction.

05:23.031 --> 05:24.281
Who's this one?

05:26.576 --> 05:29.995
You've been obstructing this investigation
from the minute you took over Beth's life.

05:30.413 --> 05:31.663
You're the prime suspect, Sarah.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.915
- I didn't kill her, Art!
- You know who did?

05:37.378 --> 05:39.963
We've got your foster brother Felix
in custody for abetting.

05:40.048 --> 05:44.259
And your daughter, she's gonna be one
lonely little girl unless you start talking.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.552
You wouldn't believe it.

05:45.803 --> 05:46.928
Yeah?

05:50.308 --> 05:51.433
Try me.

05:51.809 --> 05:54.478
Good!
Slide it out again, go!

05:54.562 --> 05:57.022
Good, come on! Feel it work, go!

05:57.148 --> 05:59.524
Mm! Push it up. You got it.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.943
Clap it high. You know what?

06:02.070 --> 06:06.114
- Slide it out for two. Here's two.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.325
Slide it to the right again. Go here...

06:21.798 --> 06:23.632
- Yes?
- Alison.

06:25.802 --> 06:26.927
Dr. Aldous Leekie.

06:27.804 --> 06:31.223
- It's a lovely home.
- I'm warning you. I'm armed.

06:32.308 --> 06:33.475
What do you want?

06:34.143 --> 06:35.310
To make amends.

06:39.148 --> 06:41.358
So, you want me to sign a contract.

06:41.442 --> 06:43.318
More like a treaty.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.487
Rules both sides will abide by.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.531
Even though everything
you've done is illegal.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.491
You must think I'm so stupid.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.660
Stupid suburban Alison.

06:51.744 --> 06:53.078
Hmm. Quite the opposite.

06:53.162 --> 06:55.580
You're a pragmatic and decisive individual.

06:56.332 --> 06:58.125
And now that you're self-aware,

06:58.167 --> 07:00.001
we can start to answer
some of your questions.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.379
I don't want answers anymore.

07:02.463 --> 07:03.964
I want my life back.

07:04.048 --> 07:07.259
I want my family back. I want my privacy back.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.677
I want you out of my life.

07:09.887 --> 07:11.513
And I want things to be normal again.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.683
I'm so glad you said so.

07:17.228 --> 07:20.522
This enshrines your family's freedom.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.900
Guarantees protection
from the likes of Helena

07:24.652 --> 07:27.362
and ensures you'll be unmonitored.

07:28.531 --> 07:29.781
- Unmonitored?
- Yes.

07:31.325 --> 07:34.870
But in return, you agree
to twice yearly medical testing.

07:35.037 --> 07:36.955
Private and noninvasive.

07:37.540 --> 07:41.877
I don't want to scare you,
but there are health concerns.

07:42.336 --> 07:45.088
Katja's respiratory disorder.

07:45.173 --> 07:46.465
Helena's mental illness.

07:47.508 --> 07:50.552
Regular testing is in everyone's best interest.

07:51.929 --> 07:54.139
So, read it over.

07:55.224 --> 07:57.309
And discuss it with Sarah and Cosima.

07:58.144 --> 08:01.813
And as a gesture of good faith,
your monitor has been lifted.

08:02.940 --> 08:04.858
- She has?
- Mm.

08:06.444 --> 08:07.569
Don't get up.

08:19.081 --> 08:22.083
Purposely misidentified the body
of a police officer?

08:22.126 --> 08:25.337
It was a terrible case of mistaken identity.

08:25.421 --> 08:27.839
You know, it's fraud by false representation.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.674
It's two to five with your priors.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.426
I thought it was my sister.

08:31.886 --> 08:36.014
Do you know, Angela Deangelis,
I'm actually quite a fan.

08:36.097 --> 08:39.851
- Hm.
- But you really need to get laid.

08:41.812 --> 08:43.188
Yeah, tell me about it.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.274
But all I seem to meet are gay men.

08:47.235 --> 08:50.070
So, public defender then, is it?

08:50.446 --> 08:51.780
We'll get you a real shitty one.

09:00.331 --> 09:01.331
Thank you.

09:23.479 --> 09:24.479
Cosima!

09:25.940 --> 09:27.983
Please don't be alarmed.

09:28.192 --> 09:30.443
I'm beyond alarmed. I'm pissed!

09:31.153 --> 09:32.862
Let me give a lift to your hotel.

09:32.989 --> 09:35.156
I have an offer you may find interesting.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.122
It's your phone.

09:42.331 --> 09:45.417
Well, it's Beth's phone actually.

09:48.379 --> 09:51.047
So, help me wrap my head around this.

09:51.382 --> 09:53.883
Art, if you're hearing this.

09:53.968 --> 09:56.761
We found a body. It's not Beth.

09:57.346 --> 10:00.098
It's me. My name is Sarah Manning.

10:00.182 --> 10:05.020
And, you're about the only person I trust
to figure the whole thing out.

10:11.485 --> 10:14.863
Sarah, my partner killed herself.
I didn't see it coming.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.157
Help me.

10:18.743 --> 10:19.951
Help Beth.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.120
I know you care.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.334
There's a reason
we look exactly the same, Art.

10:29.253 --> 10:30.253
Okay.

10:32.798 --> 10:35.008
Why the prints match,

10:36.677 --> 10:38.386
and the DNA's all screwed up.

10:42.308 --> 10:46.561
You have to promise to protect
me and my daughter.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.397
I will, if that's what you need.

10:50.608 --> 10:51.733
I promise.

10:57.823 --> 11:01.201
- Detective, this interview is over.
- What is this?

11:01.243 --> 11:02.410
Sorry, Art.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.830
Miss Manning, I'm your lawyer, Daniel Rosen.

11:06.999 --> 11:08.625
Unshackle her, please.

11:09.126 --> 11:11.294
Miss Manning
will be leaving with me.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.801
Thank you, gentlemen.
Miss Manning.

11:26.018 --> 11:29.396
This is an employment contract
for the Dyad institute.

11:29.647 --> 11:33.817
Very generous compensation.
We want to work with you, Cosima.

11:34.193 --> 11:36.778
You've got to be kidding me.

11:37.113 --> 11:40.490
This is your complete sequenced genome.

11:40.574 --> 11:43.159
3.2 billion base pairs.

11:44.203 --> 11:49.457
My offer is the freedom
to study yourself and your sisters.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.377
Unfettered research.

11:55.089 --> 11:57.465
We share the same concerns,

11:57.550 --> 12:00.135
the same questions
about organism stability,

12:00.219 --> 12:04.597
but nobody is more invested
in your own biology than you.

12:05.307 --> 12:06.307
It's yours.

12:07.226 --> 12:08.727
Just think about it.

12:15.609 --> 12:16.818
Where are you taking me?

12:16.861 --> 12:18.570
We had your brother released as well.

12:18.654 --> 12:21.531
Who's we? You work for Dr. Leekie?

12:21.615 --> 12:22.782
Indirectly.

12:30.499 --> 12:32.292
Great. Should have known.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.127
Can we have a minute?

12:39.175 --> 12:42.343
You left me hanging with Leekie
when you didn't show up with Helena.

12:42.386 --> 12:43.678
Do you work for Leekie now?

12:43.971 --> 12:46.347
They still have Afghanistan on me.
Understand?

12:46.390 --> 12:47.724
And why is that?

12:49.935 --> 12:54.147
You changed the game for everyone, Sarah.
Now I can only help you from here.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.192
Listen to what they have to say.

12:59.570 --> 13:00.987
Do I have a choice?

13:20.674 --> 13:22.926
Right. Sarah Manning.

13:24.261 --> 13:28.556
So, my name is Rachel Duncan
and we are going to come to terms.

13:34.855 --> 13:37.023
The agreement defines mutual disclosure

13:37.900 --> 13:40.985
and formalizes contact
with what I call top-side.

13:41.403 --> 13:42.487
Top-side?

13:43.531 --> 13:47.158
So, is this the part where 20 more
of you robot bitches walk in for effect?

13:47.618 --> 13:49.911
You're not an orphan anymore, Sarah.

13:50.871 --> 13:52.413
We found you.

13:53.082 --> 13:56.459
And my role is to transition you
into self-awareness.

13:57.419 --> 13:59.587
Clone fixer. Brilliant.

14:01.590 --> 14:06.636
You know, maybe it's time I just embrace
my clonage and went on Oprah.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.266
We could be famous, you and me.

14:11.308 --> 14:15.603
We're not the enemy. Helena and her ilk are.

14:15.646 --> 14:17.605
And we're going to help with that.

14:18.315 --> 14:21.109
You wanna help? Why don't you tell me why?

14:21.193 --> 14:24.237
What am I doing, sat here looking at you?
What are we for?

14:24.780 --> 14:27.782
Disclosure is defined herein.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.869
We want your trust.

14:30.953 --> 14:34.330
You want precious answers
that cut to the core of who you are.

14:35.499 --> 14:36.833
But, above all,

14:36.917 --> 14:39.669
I know you want to make the right choice
for Kira.

14:41.463 --> 14:42.964
You're very lucky.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.466
Motherhood is wonderful.

14:51.348 --> 14:54.475
Forces behind Helena will never stop, Sarah.

14:55.561 --> 15:01.357
The most important thing in this for you,
is protection, for you and your daughter.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.194
No, thanks.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.322
I'll get by on my own.

15:07.364 --> 15:09.282
Scrambling to stay alive?

15:10.034 --> 15:12.327
You'll remain free to live
as you wish with Kira.

15:13.329 --> 15:18.249
Provided for, unmonitored but available.
Call it sovereignty association.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.502
Like I said.

15:22.546 --> 15:24.005
I'm not interested.

15:24.757 --> 15:27.216
Take 24 hours to think about it.

15:29.553 --> 15:30.845
Midnight tomorrow.

15:34.683 --> 15:36.517
They're offering us security.

15:36.852 --> 15:37.977
A truce.

15:38.687 --> 15:42.190
Rachel didn't feel like a truce,
she felt like a gun to the head.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.359
Okay, little reminder.

15:44.443 --> 15:47.445
While you and I were being arrested,
Helena escaped.

15:47.529 --> 15:49.530
--Thank you, Felix.

15:50.074 --> 15:52.867
Would you also like to remind me
my birth mum popped around

15:52.910 --> 15:54.577
and Helena's my twin sister?

15:55.621 --> 15:57.080
Oh, Jesus Murphy!

16:00.000 --> 16:01.709
- Hey.
- Hi.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.046
Hi.

16:08.550 --> 16:13.346
Sarah, I so should have listened to you
about Delphine.

16:16.392 --> 16:17.642
You all right?

16:26.902 --> 16:29.195
A career at the Dyad institute.

16:29.238 --> 16:31.280
Yeah, studying us.

16:31.365 --> 16:33.032
What are you going to do, Cosima?

16:33.075 --> 16:34.659
Oh, well...

16:34.743 --> 16:39.330
We have to know our own biology.
That's what this is all about. Right?

16:39.415 --> 16:43.167
Maybe I can help us best from the inside.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.921
I want to know what you are going to do.

16:46.964 --> 16:49.048
Well, I can't trust this Rachel bitch, can I?

16:49.091 --> 16:51.134
Not if Kira's the first child of a clone.

16:51.218 --> 16:56.097
Scientifically unclassified,
she could be what Rachel is actually after.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.099
Who is Rachel? Can someone tell me,

16:58.183 --> 17:00.935
so she doesn't just show up at my door
and I have no idea who she is?

17:01.520 --> 17:04.646
Um, Amelia said she heard of doctors
back in the day

17:04.732 --> 17:07.275
discussing a child raised by Neolution.

17:07.317 --> 17:10.862
She's a pro-clone.
God, you three are weird enough.

17:12.823 --> 17:16.909
If there won't be any more spies in my life,
if my kids are safe,

17:17.368 --> 17:21.079
I'm sorry, but I have to tell you
I'm inclined to take the offer.

17:25.335 --> 17:28.463
Yeah, that's okay. That's totally your choice.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.174
Yeah, no judgment.

17:34.803 --> 17:37.388
Oh, shit! Delphine just got off a plane.

17:37.473 --> 17:40.308
Here? Stupid lady bitch.

17:41.101 --> 17:42.310
Right.

17:43.270 --> 17:45.521
She wants to help, right?

17:45.606 --> 17:50.026
Just like Art, Paul, and Rachel
and everybody wants to help.

17:50.110 --> 17:53.529
I'm going to Mrs. S's.
I'm going to be there when Kira wakes up.

17:53.655 --> 17:55.031
Okay, chap.

17:55.115 --> 17:58.326
Yeah, I mean we make our own decisions,
but I wouldn't trust anybody.

18:01.163 --> 18:04.707
- Katja Obinger. German?
- Yeah.

18:05.084 --> 18:09.128
Finally ID'd our Jane Doe
and she falls under federal jurisdiction.

18:09.463 --> 18:10.880
This whole thing reeks.

18:13.175 --> 18:17.470
Hey, you still wanna get
to the bottom of Sarah Manning?

18:21.517 --> 18:23.142
I found a known associate.

18:25.979 --> 18:29.190
I guess my turning point
was when the love of my life,

18:29.858 --> 18:31.192
well, let's just call her Sarah,

18:31.276 --> 18:35.029
Sarah broke up with me
by faking her own death.

18:37.866 --> 18:40.910
Initiating events which began
with the loss of my finger.

18:42.329 --> 18:45.373
Led to various other humiliations

18:45.457 --> 18:48.376
and ultimately to the business end
of a nail gun.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.046
That's when I just said to myself,

18:52.881 --> 18:56.050
"I need help, I need help."

18:58.220 --> 18:59.887
So...

19:00.514 --> 19:03.850
Like I said before, my name's Victor.

19:04.434 --> 19:07.270
I'm an addict, maybe, you know...

19:07.855 --> 19:08.938
So...

19:11.066 --> 19:12.400
Peace out.

19:51.607 --> 19:53.441
- You're moving.
- Yes.

19:53.942 --> 19:58.237
Chad got his own place with the dog
and I got a very handsome offer on the house.

19:58.280 --> 20:02.241
It's the perfect opportunity to get the kids out
of this toxic environment.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.619
Mm, that's priceless.

20:04.953 --> 20:07.330
Goodbye, Alison. I'm packing.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.379
- Oh, Alison, get out.
- Admit it.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.840
Admit what?

20:17.925 --> 20:22.094
That I organized your intervention?
My bad. Sorry I care.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.263
Dr. Leekie came to see me.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.849
Who? Oh, cray cray!

20:26.934 --> 20:29.644
If it's professional help, I'm all for it.

20:29.811 --> 20:31.646
I want the truth, Aynsley.

20:34.316 --> 20:37.902
The truth is that you screwed my husband

20:37.986 --> 20:40.279
and I'm moving because of you!

20:40.989 --> 20:43.199
Look at this. Yours.

20:44.159 --> 20:46.494
Gifts from my best friend.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.247
A felt Christmas angel?

20:49.706 --> 20:50.873
I made that!

20:51.041 --> 20:52.333
- Yeah?
- Yes.

20:52.376 --> 20:55.169
Well, to hell with you
and your Christmas angel.

20:59.383 --> 21:02.760
You... You turned this whole thing
around on me because you're jealous.

21:04.346 --> 21:07.056
You're barren and you can't have
your own children!

21:11.979 --> 21:13.187
Oh, my God.

21:13.522 --> 21:19.735
Alison, help.

21:24.783 --> 21:26.993
Alison!

21:31.415 --> 21:33.165
Alison...

21:45.887 --> 21:47.138
Aynsley.

21:49.599 --> 21:50.725
Aynsley?

21:55.230 --> 21:56.397
Aynsley.

22:38.273 --> 22:40.274
- Nice speech.
- Yeah, I'm moved, personally.

22:40.317 --> 22:42.735
Hey, isn't this place off limits to you guys,
you know...

22:42.778 --> 22:44.236
Sacred ground or something?

22:44.279 --> 22:47.907
Not if you got an outstanding warrant
for selling stolen meat.

22:47.949 --> 22:49.450
No, smoked pork.

22:50.535 --> 22:51.786
I didn't know it was stolen.

22:52.788 --> 22:54.455
You know what, that's lame.

22:54.664 --> 22:55.790
But I'll take the collar.

22:55.832 --> 22:57.833
Hey, come on, come on, man

22:57.918 --> 23:00.127
- I'm trying to turn my life around.
- All right, okay.

23:00.504 --> 23:03.339
So then give us something useful
on your femme fatale Sarah Manning.

23:05.801 --> 23:06.884
Of course, Sarah.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.804
Step nine of the program,
I got to suck it up and apologize

23:09.888 --> 23:11.639
for shit that I did to her, you believe that?

23:12.474 --> 23:14.225
But since she's not gonna apologize back...

23:14.768 --> 23:18.479
Last time I saw Sarah,
she was playing housewife in the suburbs.

23:18.563 --> 23:21.941
Husband, kids, minivan, whole shebang.

23:59.479 --> 24:02.064
That... That isn't Sarah Manning, is it?

24:03.191 --> 24:04.233
No.

24:06.820 --> 24:08.696
That is another person entirely.

24:08.780 --> 24:10.906
You got to be freaking kidding me.

24:19.499 --> 24:22.543
When police come, Mommy goes away.

24:23.128 --> 24:26.046
No, darling, not this time. She's back.

24:27.591 --> 24:29.383
To keep us safe from Helena.

24:30.135 --> 24:33.429
Don't worry about Helena, Kira, okay.

24:34.639 --> 24:36.599
I don't, she's not a real monster.

24:38.727 --> 24:41.479
Okay, we're gonna have to hide this bag.

24:43.565 --> 24:46.692
We might have to go on a trip,
but you can't tell anybody.

24:47.527 --> 24:48.527
Okay?

24:49.154 --> 24:50.654
Not even Mrs. S.

24:51.239 --> 24:52.907
It's a secret, yeah.

24:53.074 --> 24:54.533
- Promise?
- Okay.

24:56.203 --> 24:57.661
Do you have a spare toothbrush?

24:57.746 --> 24:59.246
- Go get it.
- Go.

25:09.758 --> 25:11.091
Where are you off to?

25:11.676 --> 25:12.676
Meeting Amelia.

25:14.471 --> 25:15.638
You all right?

25:15.931 --> 25:18.182
Just edgy
with Helena in the wind.

25:18.725 --> 25:19.808
Yeah.

25:19.893 --> 25:21.727
Sarah, mind Amelia.

25:23.271 --> 25:26.273
Why? it's true, right?
That she's my birth mum?

25:26.358 --> 25:28.400
Yeah, it... it all seems to track, just...

25:29.277 --> 25:31.612
- She didn't raise you.
- Yeah, I know.

25:31.947 --> 25:33.072
You did.

25:34.574 --> 25:36.242
It was all a long time ago.

26:06.898 --> 26:08.065
You all right?

26:09.067 --> 26:10.651
Yeah, yeah. Sorry.

26:23.957 --> 26:26.500
Oh, now I get it.

26:28.378 --> 26:30.671
Um, is Cosima...

26:30.714 --> 26:32.089
it's Delphine.

26:33.508 --> 26:34.925
She's got baggage.

26:44.853 --> 26:47.479
You know, if Sarah were here,

26:47.522 --> 26:49.440
she'd kick your wormy ass.

26:55.989 --> 26:59.199
I promise you I did not tell Leekie
about Sarah's child.

26:59.242 --> 27:00.492
What difference does it make?

27:02.203 --> 27:03.370
Why are you here?

27:03.413 --> 27:04.872
Because I...

27:06.082 --> 27:07.541
Because Leekie is a liar.

27:08.543 --> 27:10.711
And I think you can prove it scientifically
with that,

27:10.879 --> 27:12.087
your synthetic sequence.

27:12.172 --> 27:13.714
He gave me my whole genome.

27:13.798 --> 27:14.965
Yes, but you...

27:15.550 --> 27:17.718
You can't find that sequence anymore,
can you?

27:20.221 --> 27:21.347
He would have scrubbed it.

27:27.437 --> 27:28.687
Hey.

27:29.606 --> 27:30.856
Don't.

27:32.317 --> 27:33.859
I'm on your side now.

27:35.153 --> 27:37.404
--Please believe me.

27:40.241 --> 27:41.700
You need to trust someone.

27:47.874 --> 27:49.750
I think the sequence is...

27:50.752 --> 27:52.378
A message, um...

27:53.963 --> 27:55.089
Like a...

27:55.173 --> 27:57.383
Dr. Craig Venter

27:57.926 --> 28:00.260
watermarked his synthetic DNA.

28:00.303 --> 28:02.930
It's... it's a key to our origins.

28:04.599 --> 28:05.974
May I?

28:08.687 --> 28:09.728
Mm-hm.

28:10.271 --> 28:11.355
Okay.

28:15.610 --> 28:17.069
Thank you for meeting me, Sarah.

28:28.790 --> 28:30.416
- Drink?
- Just water.

28:32.001 --> 28:33.877
That poor child, Helena...

28:36.172 --> 28:38.298
How can two fates be so different?

28:38.675 --> 28:41.093
You two are like... night and day.

28:47.267 --> 28:48.475
Thank you.

28:50.145 --> 28:53.230
I'm sorry to bring you such burdens,
but I must warn you, Sarah.

28:54.065 --> 28:55.649
Your foster mother, Mrs. S,

28:55.984 --> 28:57.526
she's not who she says she is.

28:58.278 --> 28:59.445
I have something you should see.

29:01.156 --> 29:05.367
How did scientists put babies inside you?

29:05.452 --> 29:06.493
What?

29:20.008 --> 29:21.467
You gave me to them.

29:22.177 --> 29:24.136
You let them make me this way.

29:50.163 --> 29:51.163
Oh.

30:09.057 --> 30:10.307
Helena, what have you done?

30:10.391 --> 30:13.560
We missed you, sister.
Come join us.

30:21.903 --> 30:22.903
Alison.

30:23.571 --> 30:25.072
Donnie, I...

30:26.574 --> 30:28.242
Ali. Ali, you're shaking.

30:31.162 --> 30:32.788
I'm a horrible person.

30:32.872 --> 30:35.833
No, no, honey. I am.

30:36.292 --> 30:38.210
I let those people in our home.

30:38.253 --> 30:41.046
They had no right
to intervention you like that.

30:42.090 --> 30:43.507
They don't know the real you.

30:43.591 --> 30:45.801
Oh, Judas Priest, what have I done?

30:45.885 --> 30:47.594
No, no. No, no, no.

30:48.054 --> 30:49.638
Doesn't matter.

30:50.431 --> 30:51.849
We can put it all behind us.

30:52.267 --> 30:54.017
- Every little bit of it.
- Really?

30:54.227 --> 30:55.435
Yeah.

30:57.063 --> 30:58.230
Really?

31:06.865 --> 31:09.408
Okay, here's the synthetic sequence.

31:09.534 --> 31:11.618
And this is the differentiated portion.

31:11.661 --> 31:16.164
Yes, this is, uh, an encrypted ID tag,
it's how they tell you apart.

31:16.249 --> 31:18.834
Okay. But how to decode it?

31:18.918 --> 31:20.752
I have four nucleotides to work with.

31:21.296 --> 31:23.297
G, C, T and A.

31:23.423 --> 31:27.634
And no idea how they are encrypted,
I mean there's thousands of permutations.

31:27.802 --> 31:30.637
- And we are running out of time.
- Yes, but I know your tag number.

31:31.556 --> 31:33.765
- You do?
- Yes, I saw it many times.

31:33.808 --> 31:35.559
It's numeric so,

31:35.810 --> 31:39.187
if we know how that translates
then we can figure out the rest.

31:39.314 --> 31:40.397
Okay, what is it?

31:41.065 --> 31:42.649
It's 324B21.

31:43.776 --> 31:45.319
324B21?

31:47.655 --> 31:50.157
Right. I'm 324B21.

31:51.993 --> 31:52.993
I'm sorry.

31:53.828 --> 31:56.496
Well, uh, let's run these letters
through a decryption program.

31:56.581 --> 31:57.581
Yeah.

32:05.548 --> 32:32.658
Helena.

32:51.052 --> 32:53.845
Ah. None of these results match the ID tag.

32:54.180 --> 32:58.517
Okay. Okay, think. We're molecular encoding

32:59.352 --> 33:01.144
from 30 years ago.

33:01.479 --> 33:03.480
Yes, but we're looking at it from now.

33:05.692 --> 33:08.068
Of course, they weren't coding
nucleotides.

33:08.569 --> 33:09.820
They used whole base pairs?

33:09.904 --> 33:13.407
Not four letters but two. AT and GC.

33:14.742 --> 33:16.368
Ones and zeros.

33:16.703 --> 33:18.036
Binary.

33:18.079 --> 33:20.706
Uh, they were coding in ASCII.

33:32.260 --> 33:33.260
Oh, shit.

33:34.679 --> 33:38.932
Amelia.

33:42.895 --> 33:45.522
Keep pressure. I'm gonna get you help.

33:49.360 --> 33:50.610
What's this?

33:50.945 --> 33:53.113
Your foster mother.

33:53.364 --> 33:55.490
She what? She what?

33:55.908 --> 33:57.659
Foster mother.

34:02.498 --> 34:04.291
She...

34:08.129 --> 34:09.170
She what?

34:17.304 --> 34:18.304
My twin.

34:23.978 --> 34:25.228
Amelia.

34:33.862 --> 34:36.156
I'm sorry. Mother isn't very well.

34:37.824 --> 34:39.826
She's dead. You psycho.

34:40.495 --> 34:43.580
You killed someone
I've been dreaming about my whole life.

34:49.378 --> 34:50.670
She separated us.

34:56.344 --> 34:57.844
She tore us apart.

35:00.932 --> 35:03.058
But now we're together.

35:03.309 --> 35:05.811
No, we're not. You're nothing to me.

35:06.562 --> 35:09.439
Just some crazy bitch wearing my T-shirt.

35:13.027 --> 35:14.194
London Calling.

35:35.716 --> 35:40.011
Scientist made one little baby
and then we split in two.

35:47.061 --> 35:49.437
So, I cannot kill you, sister.

35:52.692 --> 35:54.442
Like you could not kill me.

36:01.576 --> 36:06.329
Sarah, we make a family. Yes?

36:06.747 --> 36:08.165
I've already got a family.

36:45.828 --> 36:47.454
Okay, moment of truth.

36:54.587 --> 36:57.923
- 324B21.
- It's your ID tag. You cracked it.

36:58.799 --> 37:00.550
Let's see what else there is.

37:01.510 --> 37:04.095
Okay. C-A-G-T-G-T.

37:10.019 --> 37:11.645
Rachel Duncan.

37:11.687 --> 37:12.812
It's Sarah.

37:14.649 --> 37:15.732
Yes, Sarah.

37:17.235 --> 37:20.153
I wanna know my daughter won't
have to live like this.

37:22.156 --> 37:23.448
We can do that.

37:23.491 --> 37:25.158
I'm coming in.

38:12.540 --> 38:14.207
One down, two to go.

38:19.630 --> 38:21.631
- What's going on over there?
- Oh!

38:25.052 --> 38:26.886
None of our business.

38:29.056 --> 38:30.849
- Your track suit?
- Mm-hm.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.101
I'm going for a jog.

38:33.769 --> 38:35.895
I've been a lump. You deserve better.

38:35.938 --> 38:38.815
Mm. I feel like a weight has been lifted.

38:46.866 --> 38:47.991
- All right.
- Okay.

38:48.075 --> 38:49.576
- Here we go.
- Bye.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.578
- See you in a bit.
- Be safe.

38:51.620 --> 38:53.163
I will.

39:10.389 --> 39:11.598
Going up?

39:20.024 --> 39:22.025
- Sarah.
- Don't.

39:26.489 --> 39:28.907
You asked me what happened in Afghanistan.

39:29.825 --> 39:31.951
I was a private contractor.

39:32.578 --> 39:35.622
I killed six marines, friendly fire.

39:36.832 --> 39:38.583
They covered it up.

39:40.002 --> 39:41.211
That's what they have on me.

39:42.004 --> 39:44.339
If you were born outside their control,

39:44.924 --> 39:46.716
what do they really have on you?

40:02.525 --> 40:05.026
- Yeah.
- Sarah, you can't make a deal.

40:05.986 --> 40:09.489
- Why not?
- Any freedom they promise is bullshit.

40:09.615 --> 40:13.827
They're liars. That synthetic sequence,
the bar code I told you about.

40:14.328 --> 40:15.954
- It's a patent.

40:16.580 --> 40:18.623
- A patent?
- We're property.

40:19.291 --> 40:22.877
Er... Our bodies are biology.

40:22.962 --> 40:27.632
Everything we are, everything we become
belongs to them.

40:27.842 --> 40:30.051
Sarah, they could claim Kira.

40:33.722 --> 40:35.181
They patented us.

41:04.545 --> 41:06.254
Back on track, I think.

41:07.882 --> 41:10.550
It's the seven year itch. it's not easy.

41:11.677 --> 41:13.386
She's not easy.

41:47.296 --> 41:49.047
You know what to do.

41:50.925 --> 41:54.594
This organism and derivative
genetic material is restricted

41:54.678 --> 41:56.387
intellectual property.

42:04.939 --> 42:06.814
I'm sick, Delphine.

42:34.093 --> 42:35.301
Siobhan!

42:37.972 --> 42:56.614
Kira!
