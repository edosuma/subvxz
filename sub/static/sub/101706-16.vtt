WEBVTT

00:01.436 --> 00:03.133
<i>Previously on</i> SWAT...I have been working

00:03.177 --> 00:05.048
so hard to do good. I tell
the people in this community

00:05.092 --> 00:09.226
that police can do better,
that we will do better,

00:09.270 --> 00:10.836
and I'm not
getting anywhere.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.012
I know you're busy,
but I called the prison

00:12.055 --> 00:13.883
-to check on your mom.
-You did what?

00:13.926 --> 00:16.190
I talked to a doctor.
It's something with her liver.

00:16.233 --> 00:18.931
You know you still have time
to fix things with her.

00:18.975 --> 00:21.238
-I'm Nora Fowler, tactical medic.
<i>I handpicked you</i>

00:21.282 --> 00:24.111
for this team. I read what
happened to you overseas.

00:24.154 --> 00:25.851
Someone you knew?
Your KIA bracelet.

00:25.895 --> 00:27.244
Yeah, he was.

00:27.288 --> 00:28.463
Next time we have a night off,
I'll take you through

00:28.506 --> 00:30.073
the SWAT training course.

00:30.117 --> 00:31.292
I'll get the best
out of you.

00:31.335 --> 00:33.859
<i>One of my guys, he uncovered</i>

00:33.903 --> 00:35.078
<i>a group of racist cops
in the department.</i>

00:35.122 --> 00:36.558
When I give this to I.A.,

00:36.601 --> 00:38.560
an official investigation
will open.

00:38.603 --> 00:40.040
Are you sure
you want to do this?

00:40.083 --> 00:42.520
No, but I can't do nothing.

00:42.564 --> 00:44.479
Sorry it took me a
while to figure out
the right thing to do.

00:44.522 --> 00:45.915
We good?

00:45.958 --> 00:46.742
We're good.

00:54.619 --> 00:57.361
Hey, man, you know what's up!

00:57.405 --> 00:59.450
Yo, where my lawyer at, man?
Come on!

01:01.365 --> 01:03.280
Nothing to be curious about.
Just another courthouse.

01:04.716 --> 01:05.804
-<i>Hermano.
-Keep walking, Diaz.</i>

01:05.848 --> 01:07.023
That's my brother in there, man.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.068
Put me in with my boys.

01:08.111 --> 01:09.721
Stop here.

01:09.765 --> 01:11.897
Come on. Why I got to be alone?

01:11.941 --> 01:13.464
Warden says you four
don't play nice.

01:13.508 --> 01:15.031
Mostly you.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.859
Now step inside.

01:31.439 --> 01:32.962
Public defender thought
you might want to wear it,

01:33.005 --> 01:35.356
show the jury what
an outstanding citizen you are.

01:50.153 --> 01:52.199
-We good, Deputy?
-All set.

01:52.242 --> 01:54.897
Holler when you're done. I'll
-have your stuff ready to go.
-All right.

01:54.940 --> 01:57.073
So Legal Affairs confirmed
that the defense attorney

01:57.117 --> 01:59.031
only needs us as
rebuttal witnesses.

01:59.075 --> 02:00.816
Should be out of here
-in no time.
Yeah, okay, Deac.

02:00.859 --> 02:03.297
When was the last time you got
out of court in no time?

02:03.340 --> 02:04.515
Today would be the first.

02:04.559 --> 02:05.864
Exactly.

02:09.651 --> 02:12.306
You know,
I got to be honest, man,

02:12.349 --> 02:14.351
a civilian gets injured
in a raid,

02:14.395 --> 02:16.745
and the officer who broke down
the door admits he was at fault?

02:18.442 --> 02:20.270
I'm just not sure how I feel
about being called in

02:20.314 --> 02:22.533
to testify on behalf
of the city.

02:22.577 --> 02:27.277
It's not anything we haven't
done dozens of times before.

02:27.321 --> 02:29.410
SWAT was just there for support.

02:29.453 --> 02:32.282
That the only thing
that's bugging you?

02:32.326 --> 02:34.589
Real talk?

02:34.632 --> 02:36.721
It's been a week since
Durham got suspended,

02:36.765 --> 02:39.550
yet he and his pals
are still LAPD.

02:39.594 --> 02:41.596
I don't know, I just keep
asking myself questions

02:41.639 --> 02:44.207
about the union and
the city bureaucracy.

02:44.251 --> 02:46.078
Takes a while to get
an officer off the street.

02:46.122 --> 02:47.558
You know that.

02:47.602 --> 02:49.517
Doesn't feel like
justice, Deac.

02:49.560 --> 02:52.433
Just a lot of red
tape and delays.

02:52.476 --> 02:54.348
The city expects a
lot from us cops.

02:54.391 --> 02:56.393
Maybe I expect
more from them.

02:56.437 --> 02:58.221
Sergeants.

02:58.265 --> 03:00.354
Tony Jacobs,
assistant city attorney.

03:00.397 --> 03:02.573
Thanks for coming in early.
I know it's a pain.

03:02.617 --> 03:05.446
Eh, it's not a problem. Beats
dealing with the morning rush.

03:05.489 --> 03:07.230
Hey, listen, you seem to have
a good amount of testimony

03:07.274 --> 03:08.536
for this case already.

03:08.579 --> 03:09.798
Why do you need us?

03:09.841 --> 03:11.452
Cut right to the chase, huh?

03:11.495 --> 03:12.670
Well, frankly,
what this woman

03:12.714 --> 03:14.977
is asking for
in damages is excessive.

03:15.020 --> 03:16.283
Testimony from
two SWAT sergeants

03:16.326 --> 03:17.806
could go a long way
in the court.

03:17.849 --> 03:19.677
Just follow my lead
on the stand.

03:19.721 --> 03:20.678
We'll have you
out of here in a jiff.

03:21.984 --> 03:23.203
Our courtroom's
on the third floor.

03:33.474 --> 03:35.258
-Jimmy.
-Hi, Mom.

03:35.302 --> 03:36.868
What are you
doing here?

03:36.912 --> 03:39.001
Oh, my gosh, I must
be a complete mess.

03:39.044 --> 03:41.873
I wish I'd known
that you were coming.

03:41.917 --> 03:44.267
How did you know
where to find me?

03:44.311 --> 03:47.270
Uh, I called the prison and
they said they transferred you.

03:47.314 --> 03:50.230
The doctor said there's a
real problem with your liver?

03:50.273 --> 03:52.580
Oh, sweetie, you don't have
to worry about that.

03:52.623 --> 03:54.103
I told them not to tell you.

03:54.146 --> 03:58.150
I mean, I specifically
asked them not to contact you.

03:58.194 --> 03:59.630
Really? 'Cause if that's true,
they violated

03:59.674 --> 04:00.979
some pretty major privacy laws.

04:01.023 --> 04:02.285
Maybe I should go talk to them.

04:02.329 --> 04:04.374
No, no, no, Jimmy, Jimmy,
don't-don't bother.

04:04.418 --> 04:07.334
Uh, look,
maybe I did sign something.

04:07.377 --> 04:09.814
They were putting
so many things in front of me

04:09.858 --> 04:12.426
and I'm on all these
medications, and...

04:12.469 --> 04:14.297
I mean,
maybe-maybe one of them

04:14.341 --> 04:18.475
was a-a privacy waiver, I...

04:18.519 --> 04:19.998
Yeah.

04:20.042 --> 04:21.348
You know, I've been here
less than a minute,

04:21.391 --> 04:23.001
and I already feel like
I'm being played.

04:23.045 --> 04:25.221
Sweetie, don't do this.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.354
You're here.

04:27.397 --> 04:29.965
Who knows how many moments
like this we have left?

04:30.008 --> 04:32.184
Wow.

04:34.230 --> 04:36.014
Okay, you want
to know the truth?

04:36.058 --> 04:37.146
Fine.

04:37.189 --> 04:39.540
I'm dying, okay?

04:39.583 --> 04:41.585
My liver's shot,
and with my history

04:41.629 --> 04:44.240
of addiction,
I don't stand a hope

04:44.284 --> 04:46.198
of getting on the waiting list
for a new one.

04:46.242 --> 04:48.200
So...

04:48.244 --> 04:52.248
Look, I've had a lot of time
to lie here and think.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.903
Jimmy, I'm so sorry.

04:54.946 --> 04:59.386
I'm sorry that I screwed you
out of a childhood,

04:59.429 --> 05:01.431
and caused you grief ever since.

05:01.475 --> 05:03.390
I was a lousy mom.

05:03.433 --> 05:06.523
I just want you
to promise me something.

05:06.567 --> 05:09.744
I want you to promise me
that you do not blame yourself

05:09.787 --> 05:11.354
for getting me locked up again.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.748
It was not your fault.

05:13.791 --> 05:15.184
And if I'd listened
to you sooner

05:15.227 --> 05:16.577
and straightened out my life,

05:16.620 --> 05:18.709
then maybe I wouldn't
be here now.

05:22.713 --> 05:24.367
Is there anything you need?

05:24.411 --> 05:26.369
No, nothing. I...

05:26.413 --> 05:29.111
Just, will-will you come
sit with me?

05:29.154 --> 05:31.548
Tell me about your life,

05:31.592 --> 05:33.463
about what's going on with you.

05:33.507 --> 05:35.552
Please?

05:44.996 --> 05:47.216
Hey.

05:47.259 --> 05:49.349
So I overheard the plaintiff's
lawyer out there.

05:49.392 --> 05:51.742
He's been trying to settle for a
fraction of the original claim.

05:51.786 --> 05:54.484
-The city won't agree.
-Why not?

05:54.528 --> 05:55.442
Well, I guess Jacobs finagled
a last-minute reassignment

05:55.485 --> 05:56.791
so the case would be heard

05:56.834 --> 05:58.053
by this judge
specifically.

05:58.096 --> 06:00.447
She's notorious for
backing the badge.

06:00.490 --> 06:02.405
The city's
playing hardball.

06:02.449 --> 06:06.148
So the city attorney is using us
to sink this lady's case.

06:07.584 --> 06:09.064
There's a decent chance

06:09.107 --> 06:11.066
that she deserves every dollar
that she's asking for.

06:16.288 --> 06:18.029
Mr. Jacobs.

06:18.073 --> 06:20.858
I'd be lying if I didn't say
I was having second thoughts

06:20.902 --> 06:23.208
-about testifying.
-What's the problem?

06:23.252 --> 06:24.949
Feels like you're using
SWAT's reputation

06:24.993 --> 06:27.082
to score points that
you can't get any other way.

06:27.125 --> 06:28.649
I'm not asking you to lie,
Sergeant.

06:28.692 --> 06:29.693
I'm not sure I'm down
to be used like that.

06:29.737 --> 06:31.695
You're kidding.

06:31.739 --> 06:33.480
You spring this
on me right now?

06:33.523 --> 06:34.872
You're a public
servant, same as me.

06:34.916 --> 06:36.570
We both have obligations
to the city.

06:36.613 --> 06:40.704
No, we have obligations
to the citizens, not the city.

06:40.748 --> 06:43.011
Sergeant Kay? What about you?

06:44.926 --> 06:45.970
Can you, uh,
give us a minute, please?

06:52.673 --> 06:54.936
You serious about this?

06:54.979 --> 06:57.634
I'm dead-ass serious, Deacon.

06:57.678 --> 07:00.855
I'm just about done with
"business as usual" these days.

07:05.686 --> 07:08.123
Dr. Hale? Hi.

07:08.166 --> 07:09.646
I'm, uh, Jim Street.
My mother Karen

07:09.690 --> 07:11.474
is one of your patients.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.476
-Yeah. Hi.
-This thing
with her liver.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.999
How bad is it really? I mean,

07:15.043 --> 07:17.785
she seems pretty convinced
she's dying.

07:17.828 --> 07:19.047
Your mother's cirrhosis
is advanced.

07:19.090 --> 07:20.788
It's not end-stage yet,
but I'm afraid

07:20.831 --> 07:22.659
it's only a matter of time.

07:22.703 --> 07:24.487
-Okay, so what about treatment?
-Short of a transplant,

07:24.531 --> 07:26.402
there's really very little
we can offer.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.448
And she doesn't qualify
for getting on a donor list,

07:28.491 --> 07:30.014
so what, that's just it?

07:30.058 --> 07:31.625
Not necessarily.

07:31.668 --> 07:33.583
I've discussed a living donor
transplant with her.

07:33.627 --> 07:35.716
-Okay, w-what's that?
-If a potential donor,

07:35.759 --> 07:37.848
typically a family member,
tests as a match,

07:37.892 --> 07:40.242
we can harvest
part of their liver

07:40.285 --> 07:42.505
and transplant it
into the patient.

07:42.549 --> 07:45.073
Usually, a donor gives up
about half the organ,

07:45.116 --> 07:46.814
which regenerates
over several months.

07:46.857 --> 07:49.077
We've seen great
success with it.

07:49.120 --> 07:51.035
Your mom didn't
mention any of this?

07:52.428 --> 07:53.734
Must've slipped her mind.

07:55.344 --> 07:57.389
You know the drill, Diaz.
Exit the cell,

07:57.433 --> 07:58.869
keep your eyes straight ahead.

08:13.231 --> 08:14.537
<i>Ya está.</i>

08:14.581 --> 08:16.191
Yo, what's up, man?

08:16.234 --> 08:17.584
What do you got there?

08:17.627 --> 08:18.889
Come on, now!

08:20.630 --> 08:21.501
Hey, hold up, man.

08:23.851 --> 08:25.330
-Move your asses. Go!
-Come on, let's go.

08:25.374 --> 08:26.375
Go!

08:33.600 --> 08:34.557
Drop the gun!

08:34.601 --> 08:36.124
Down on your knees!

08:36.167 --> 08:37.821
-Get out of the way!
-Drop your weapon.

08:37.865 --> 08:39.736
10-39. Four inmates
on the loose

08:39.780 --> 08:42.609
in the lobby. One is armed!

08:45.394 --> 08:46.482
Drop your weapon!

08:46.526 --> 08:47.309
Out of the way or he's dead!

08:51.226 --> 08:53.620
Those are gunshots.
Sounds like downstairs.

08:53.663 --> 08:55.709
I'll kill him now!
Clear the building!

08:55.752 --> 08:57.580
Get out now!

08:57.624 --> 09:00.627
Everyone,
stay where you are.

09:00.670 --> 09:01.628
This is an active shooter alarm.

09:03.064 --> 09:04.892
More cops in front.

09:04.935 --> 09:05.849
Go, find another way out.

09:05.893 --> 09:07.242
It's locked, it won't budge.

09:11.159 --> 09:13.030
Your Honor,
open that door right now.

09:13.074 --> 09:14.031
We have a protocol, Sergeant.

09:14.075 --> 09:15.424
This is my courtroom.

09:15.467 --> 09:16.904
I'm responsible
for the lives in it.

09:16.947 --> 09:18.427
And we're responsible
for the ones out there.

09:18.470 --> 09:21.082
Go!

09:21.125 --> 09:22.649
-Open the door.
-The way our system's set up,

09:22.692 --> 09:24.999
I can't, even if I wanted to.

09:26.696 --> 09:27.828
-Come on.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.218
I can't get a straight answer
from the Sheriff's Department.

10:10.261 --> 10:11.915
How the hell
are there no deputies left

10:11.959 --> 10:13.482
-inside that courthouse?
-Look, they had to retreat.

10:13.525 --> 10:14.657
We know the prisoners killed
two of them

10:14.701 --> 10:16.224
and threatened to keep killing.

10:16.267 --> 10:17.965
And we got 30 civilians inside?

10:18.008 --> 10:19.401
Yeah, at least, maybe more.

10:19.444 --> 10:20.881
Emotions are running high
here, Commander.

10:20.924 --> 10:22.273
Understandable.
They just lost two of their own.

10:22.317 --> 10:24.493
Rocker and Brenner's teams
are with the Feds

10:24.536 --> 10:25.668
on a raid in Lakewood.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.322
I'm making the call.

10:27.365 --> 10:28.671
This is on 20-David.
Let them know.

10:28.715 --> 10:31.631
Roger. Hang on.
Hondo's clicking in.

10:31.674 --> 10:32.588
Take it.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.068
Hondo, I'm out front

10:34.111 --> 10:36.157
with Street and Tan.
Where are you guys?

10:36.200 --> 10:38.159
Deac and I are locked down in
a courtroom on the third floor.

10:38.202 --> 10:40.030
Active shooter protocol.
The security system's

10:40.074 --> 10:41.249
turned this place into
a panic room,

10:41.292 --> 10:42.859
and we are stuck without
firearms.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.208
What'd you find out
about the shooter?

10:44.252 --> 10:45.906
It's not just one,
there are four of them.

10:45.949 --> 10:47.516
They already killed
a couple deputies.

10:47.559 --> 10:48.865
We got four armed
inmates downstairs.

10:48.909 --> 10:51.128
Sounds like a barricade
situation.

10:51.172 --> 10:53.174
They make any demands?

10:53.217 --> 10:54.958
-There hasn't been contact yet.
I got their IDs.

10:55.002 --> 10:57.874
Sergio Diaz, his brother
Adrian, Beni Rios,

10:57.918 --> 10:59.920
Nico Guzman.
Members of Los Mags.

10:59.963 --> 11:02.183
Ran their hit squad.
They executed nine people.

11:02.226 --> 11:03.793
Due to be sentenced today.
Capital murder.

11:03.837 --> 11:05.012
Expected to get life
without parole.

11:05.055 --> 11:06.883
Yeah, Commander said
this is on us, boss.

11:06.927 --> 11:09.407
The team's all here now,
so what's the game plan?

11:09.451 --> 11:11.018
We're flying blind here, Luca.

11:11.061 --> 11:12.541
Listen, you're senior man
on-site.

11:12.584 --> 11:14.630
You are in charge now.
The team is in your hands.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.198
Luca.

11:17.241 --> 11:20.375
-Hondo, someone's coming outside.
All right, go.

11:20.418 --> 11:22.594
-You got this, man.
Any cop comes
near this building,

11:22.638 --> 11:24.684
people gonna die!

11:24.727 --> 11:26.337
Eyes on Sergio Diaz.
Stay back.

11:26.381 --> 11:28.557
-You can't get out of this, Diaz!
-What the hell you just say?

11:28.600 --> 11:30.472
Deputy, put that thing down!

11:30.515 --> 11:31.865
I said this won't
end well for you!

11:31.908 --> 11:33.475
You think I'm scared
to drop bodies?

11:33.518 --> 11:35.042
-Move in!

11:35.085 --> 11:37.261
No, stay back! Hang back.

11:37.305 --> 11:39.002
-Who's in charge out there?
-I am.

11:39.046 --> 11:41.309
Officer Dominique Luca,
LAPD SWAT.

11:41.352 --> 11:43.093
What do you want, Mr. Diaz?

11:43.137 --> 11:45.661
I want you to stay away
from the building. If you don't,

11:45.705 --> 11:46.836
the blood's on your hands.

11:53.321 --> 11:55.236
Hey, he hit that woman hard.
She's got to be hurt.

11:55.279 --> 11:57.107
You think Diaz is testing us?

11:57.151 --> 11:59.022
What if he's luring us there to
get a better shot at one of us?

11:59.066 --> 12:00.458
What if she needs
immediate medical attention?

12:00.502 --> 12:03.723
Either way, we need to
figure out a way to get her

12:03.766 --> 12:05.072
and everyone else out soon.

12:05.115 --> 12:06.551
I need to talk to Diaz,

12:06.595 --> 12:08.249
find out what it's gonna take
to end this.

12:09.641 --> 12:12.470
You think Luca's okay?

12:12.514 --> 12:13.689
Being in charge, I mean.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.038
Yeah, he's got it.

12:17.432 --> 12:18.738
Try it.

12:21.828 --> 12:22.785
You got it, Deac, it's open.

12:22.829 --> 12:25.048
Don't go out there unarmed.

12:25.092 --> 12:28.399
We are not doing anybody
any good locked in here.

12:28.443 --> 12:30.793
I know you're SWAT, but there's
safety protocols for a reason.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.577
-It's best if we all stay put.
Listen.

12:32.621 --> 12:34.057
The two of us are gonna go
get the lay of the land.

12:34.101 --> 12:35.276
We'll be back.

12:35.319 --> 12:36.451
We will be back.

12:47.984 --> 12:49.638
That crap ain't gonna help.
We need firepower.

12:49.681 --> 12:50.813
We need leverage.

12:50.857 --> 12:51.988
Find everyone up in here.

12:52.032 --> 12:53.685
Beat down doors if you have to.

12:53.729 --> 12:54.991
Put 'em in Courtroom 1.

12:55.035 --> 12:56.471
<i>!¡Andale!</i> Go!

13:02.303 --> 13:04.522
Get down!

13:04.566 --> 13:06.002
Get down. Move!

13:06.046 --> 13:07.438
Sounds like they're
headed our way,

13:07.482 --> 13:08.613
taking hostages.

13:08.657 --> 13:09.745
They're desperate.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.138
That means they're dangerous.

13:11.181 --> 13:12.748
No one's safe.
We got to evacuate.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.881
There's got to be a fire escape
or some way out of here.

13:25.152 --> 13:26.544
Deac, check the windows.

13:32.550 --> 13:34.117
A building covered
in windows,

13:34.161 --> 13:35.597
and none of these
damn things open.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.686
There.

13:37.729 --> 13:39.775
I just commandeered every
phone line on the ground floor,

13:39.819 --> 13:41.124
but if Diaz doesn't want
to pick up...

13:41.168 --> 13:43.300
No, he'll pick up.
Keep them ringing.

13:49.437 --> 13:50.873
This is Officer Luca.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.570
Am I speaking with Sergio Diaz?

13:52.614 --> 13:54.181
What do you want?

13:54.224 --> 13:55.704
Look, I want to know that
no one else is gonna get hurt,

13:55.747 --> 13:56.966
including you.

13:57.010 --> 13:58.533
Don't worry too much
about that lady.

13:58.576 --> 14:01.101
Just a bump on the head.
I can do a whole lot worse.

14:01.144 --> 14:02.885
Listen, there's no way
out of here for you.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.713
You know that.
If you give up now,

14:04.756 --> 14:06.671
you won't be harmed, okay?
You have my word.

14:06.715 --> 14:09.152
You know what that means to me,
Officer Luca?

14:09.196 --> 14:11.676
Nada.
Now you listen.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.417
Me and my boys want
a helicopter.

14:13.461 --> 14:15.855
Look, a helicopter's
not realistic.

14:15.898 --> 14:17.595
Maybe I can
get you an SUV.

14:17.639 --> 14:19.902
But you've got to promise that
everyone will be safe.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.338
I decide what's realistic, ese.

14:21.382 --> 14:23.384
Tell the pilot
to keep it running.

14:23.427 --> 14:25.168
Find someone that don't mind
having a gun to his head.

14:25.212 --> 14:26.691
There are other ways
out of this.

14:26.735 --> 14:28.868
I almost forgot--
bulletproof vests, four of them.

14:28.911 --> 14:31.609
You got 40 minutes, or lots of
people gonna die one at a time.

14:31.653 --> 14:33.046
Listen...

14:34.917 --> 14:36.005
I just got a text
from Deacon.

14:36.049 --> 14:37.224
They think they found a way out.

14:37.267 --> 14:39.008
They need our help.

14:41.619 --> 14:43.970
We've got an exit plan.

14:44.013 --> 14:46.276
We found a set of windows on
-the other side of the floor.
-No way.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.930
We'll be sitting ducks out
there; we're better off here.

14:47.974 --> 14:50.106
Listen to me, all of you.

14:50.150 --> 14:52.456
The gunmen are breaking
into rooms and taking hostages.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.023
They're gonna be up here
very soon.

14:54.067 --> 14:56.417
We cannot stay.
You've got to trust us.

14:56.460 --> 14:59.159
Go ahead. I'm not
going anywhere.

14:59.202 --> 15:01.291
You're making a mistake.
Come on, let's go. Come on.

15:01.335 --> 15:03.772
Come on, we don't have time.
Let's go.

15:03.815 --> 15:05.861
Come on.

15:08.429 --> 15:09.778
Follow me.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.702
Keep it up,
as fast as you can move.

15:20.745 --> 15:22.095
Let's go.

15:22.138 --> 15:23.966
Over here!
-Wait a minute.

15:24.010 --> 15:25.185
Wait a minute.
Shh, shh, shh.

15:27.448 --> 15:30.799
Keep going.

15:30.842 --> 15:32.279
Come on.
Let's go. Move.

15:32.322 --> 15:33.889
Let's go.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.154
All right, let's go.
Move, move, move.

15:39.460 --> 15:41.157
Door.

15:41.201 --> 15:42.942
It's locked.

15:42.985 --> 15:44.334
Kick it down.

15:49.252 --> 15:51.428
They're coming. We got
to move. Let's go.

15:51.472 --> 15:52.952
Let's go.
Quickly, quickly.

16:01.047 --> 16:02.700
-There's Hondo.
Get ready.

16:02.744 --> 16:04.572
There's gonna be six of them.

16:04.615 --> 16:07.096
All right, come on, step out.
Let's go. Come on.

16:09.316 --> 16:10.882
Everybody. Let's go.

16:10.926 --> 16:12.319
Follow me.
Follow me.

16:12.362 --> 16:13.320
You're fine. Let's go.

16:13.363 --> 16:17.802
Keep moving. Keep moving.

16:17.846 --> 16:20.022
You're okay.
You're okay, come on.

16:24.244 --> 16:25.419
All right,
everybody stop right here.

16:25.462 --> 16:27.203
Okay, I want you to sit down.
Just sit down.

16:27.247 --> 16:28.726
Put your feet
over the ledge.

16:28.770 --> 16:30.641
Okay, just focus on me.

16:30.685 --> 16:31.729
Trust me, this is nothing.

16:31.773 --> 16:32.730
It's just like when
you were a kid

16:32.774 --> 16:33.818
jumping off a high dive.

16:33.862 --> 16:35.124
Stay loose.

16:35.168 --> 16:36.734
I'm gonna give you
a little push on three.

16:36.778 --> 16:38.301
Here we go. One...

16:38.345 --> 16:41.087
two... three.

16:43.350 --> 16:46.266
Hey, come towards my voice.

16:46.309 --> 16:48.485
Come on, who's next? Let's go.
Come on, we don't have time.

16:48.529 --> 16:49.921
We got you.

16:49.965 --> 16:51.314
Come on.

16:51.358 --> 16:52.707
-Nice and easy.
-Okay, okay.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.448
You all right? Okay.

16:54.491 --> 16:55.579
You're gonna be just fine.
Don't think about it.

16:55.623 --> 16:57.842
On three.
One, two, three.

17:01.150 --> 17:02.412
All right, keep coming,
keep coming. Come on.

17:02.456 --> 17:04.197
Now.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.068
Feet over the
ledge. Okay.

17:06.112 --> 17:08.244
Hey, look at me.
You got this.

17:08.288 --> 17:09.898
Don't worry about it.
On three. One...

17:09.941 --> 17:12.161
two, three.

17:13.510 --> 17:14.729
Come on, over here, over here.

17:14.772 --> 17:16.861
All right, Judge.
Come on, Judge.

17:16.905 --> 17:18.211
It's okay, it's okay.

17:18.254 --> 17:19.864
Feet over the ledge,
just look at me.

17:19.908 --> 17:21.083
My team's got you.
Here we go.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.824
On three. One...

17:22.867 --> 17:24.521
two, three.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.006
They're closing in.
What do you think?

17:32.877 --> 17:34.183
Deac, if we jump, we're out.

17:34.227 --> 17:36.881
There'll be nobody
-left here to help.
-I know.

17:59.556 --> 18:01.297
Give me an update, Luca.

18:01.341 --> 18:02.994
-Hondo and Deacon stayed?
-Yeah.

18:03.038 --> 18:04.518
-Did they find their weapons?
-No.

18:04.561 --> 18:06.085
But we're working on a plan
to help them with that.

18:06.128 --> 18:07.782
Right now we
have 32 minutes

18:07.825 --> 18:10.567
before Diaz said he'll
start killing.

18:10.611 --> 18:12.874
Getting a chopper for these guys
isn't a real possibility, is it?

18:12.917 --> 18:14.658
No, we can't let it
come to that.

18:14.702 --> 18:16.878
Maybe we can offer it
as bait to lure them out.

18:18.706 --> 18:20.229
22-David, where'd
those shots come from?

18:20.273 --> 18:23.232
Who has eyes?26-David.

18:23.276 --> 18:25.408
Eyes on Adrian Diaz
at the third floor window.

18:25.452 --> 18:26.670
He shot and deflated
the rescue bag.

18:29.020 --> 18:32.023
Hold.

18:32.067 --> 18:34.374
We got to go back.

18:48.997 --> 18:50.259
Tan's texting.

18:55.177 --> 18:56.483
-Hey, Luca.
-Yeah?

18:56.526 --> 18:58.615
I got Deac.
Hey, you guys okay?

18:58.659 --> 18:59.790
Yeah, we're good.

18:59.834 --> 19:01.575
We heard gunshots.
They firing at you guys?

19:01.618 --> 19:03.359
No, not at us,
just at the rescue bag.

19:03.403 --> 19:04.969
They're rounding
people up in here.

19:05.013 --> 19:06.362
It looks like all four of
these guys are armed now.

19:06.406 --> 19:07.711
Listen, Tan might have
found a way

19:07.755 --> 19:09.365
for you guys to even
the playing field.

19:09.409 --> 19:10.497
We're listening.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.281
We got Deputy Ross with us.

19:12.325 --> 19:14.675
She says there's a spare key
to the gun locker room
in her office.

19:14.718 --> 19:17.199
Room B. It's a red key chain,
number six.

19:17.243 --> 19:19.288
If you can get to that key,
you can get your firearms back.

19:19.332 --> 19:22.335
-That's two floors down.
-Won't be easy
with them patrolling.

19:22.378 --> 19:24.380
Okay, we'll try to come up
with a way to keep these
guys occupied.

19:24.424 --> 19:25.599
We just need time to
get our guns, Luca.

19:25.642 --> 19:27.296
Okay, good luck.

19:27.340 --> 19:28.645
Let's get Diaz on the line.

19:30.256 --> 19:32.258
Diaz, can you hear me?

19:32.301 --> 19:34.173
You're more worried about
getting people out

19:34.216 --> 19:35.783
than giving me what I want.

19:35.826 --> 19:37.263
Where's my damn helicopter?

19:37.306 --> 19:38.525
It's tough for me to help you

19:38.568 --> 19:39.961
when guys are shooting
out of windows.

19:40.004 --> 19:41.136
Stop stalling,

19:41.180 --> 19:42.746
or your problems will get
much worse.

19:42.790 --> 19:43.791
You know what, you're right.

19:43.834 --> 19:46.663
I am stalling.
I have to.

19:46.707 --> 19:49.536
Okay, it takes time to get
a helicopter ready.

19:49.579 --> 19:51.407
But this is what
I can do right now.

19:51.451 --> 19:53.496
I can get you those
bulletproof vests,

19:53.540 --> 19:56.151
-but I need something in return.
-What?

19:56.195 --> 19:58.675
You have to turn over
four hostages,

19:58.719 --> 20:00.416
including that woman
that you hurt.

20:00.460 --> 20:02.331
No deal.
I don't trust you.

20:02.375 --> 20:03.854
I don't trust you either, yet.

20:03.898 --> 20:06.248
But this is how
you and me build trust,

20:06.292 --> 20:09.773
by making a small deal
that we both live up to.

20:09.817 --> 20:11.340
Okay.

20:11.384 --> 20:13.255
Four vests for four hostages.

20:13.299 --> 20:14.691
Okay, give us some time.

20:14.735 --> 20:16.606
We'll have the vests brought
to the front door.

20:16.650 --> 20:19.261
I want you to bring 'em.
Just you.

20:19.305 --> 20:21.263
You got five minutes.

20:21.307 --> 20:24.223
Hey, look at me.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.094
You don't have to do this.

20:26.137 --> 20:29.402
If it gives us hostages,
I'm going.

20:31.578 --> 20:33.101
You keep looking
at that thing.

20:33.144 --> 20:35.277
Oh, it's nothing.

20:37.279 --> 20:38.802
Actually, it's something.

20:38.846 --> 20:42.589
I went and visited my mom
today in the hospital.

20:42.632 --> 20:44.504
Her liver's failing.

20:44.547 --> 20:46.854
So it's life-threatening.

20:46.897 --> 20:49.900
Even legitimately dying, she
still wasn't straight with me.

20:49.944 --> 20:53.643
Just tried to butter me up
to get what she wants.

20:53.687 --> 20:55.123
Which is what?

20:56.342 --> 20:57.865
My liver, apparently.

20:57.908 --> 20:59.475
Or part of it.

20:59.519 --> 21:02.304
Her doctor wants me to test
to see if I'm a match.

21:02.348 --> 21:03.523
I guess they can do
partial transplants

21:03.566 --> 21:05.481
with living donors now.

21:05.525 --> 21:07.309
You're not seriously
considering it?

21:07.353 --> 21:08.310
I mean, it's still
a major surgery,

21:08.354 --> 21:11.182
but if I'm a match...

21:11.226 --> 21:14.360
Won't that jeopardize your life
and your SWAT career?

21:14.403 --> 21:15.796
What am I supposed to do?
Say no?

21:15.839 --> 21:18.015
That's basically
a death sentence for her.

21:18.059 --> 21:20.801
I don't know
if I can live with that.

21:20.844 --> 21:22.803
Look, I'm just getting tested.
Maybe I'm not a match.

21:33.553 --> 21:35.468
Shut up and keep moving.

21:35.511 --> 21:37.557
Armed suspect's taking
a woman to the lobby.

21:45.042 --> 21:46.609
Deac, let's go.

21:49.786 --> 21:51.005
All right,
we got the right office.

21:51.048 --> 21:52.702
Look for a red key chain.

21:52.746 --> 21:53.921
Hey, that's our courtroom
upstairs.

21:53.964 --> 21:55.879
There's Jacobs.

21:55.923 --> 21:59.230
Deacon. Oh, my God.

21:59.274 --> 22:00.754
We should've tried harder
to get him to come with us.

22:00.797 --> 22:02.277
Hey, we didn't have time.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.844
And listen,

22:03.887 --> 22:05.367
you deciding not to testify,

22:05.411 --> 22:06.890
that wasn't exactly fair to him.

22:06.934 --> 22:08.065
What, that wasn't fair
to Jacobs?

22:08.109 --> 22:10.067
What about
the plaintiff?

22:10.111 --> 22:11.721
A city attorney shouldn't be
allowed to take a case

22:11.765 --> 22:13.549
-and reassign it to bend justice.
-All right, do some

22:13.593 --> 22:15.334
of these guys care more about
winning than justice? Yeah.

22:17.118 --> 22:18.685
But we got to work
within the system.

22:18.728 --> 22:20.730
We can't do that
anymore, Deac.

22:20.774 --> 22:22.689
That's how we end up with
racist cops who don't get fired.

22:24.125 --> 22:25.692
Jacobs? He's just doing his job.

22:25.735 --> 22:27.128
Just like us.

22:27.171 --> 22:28.695
Found it.

22:30.479 --> 22:32.525
All right, move, move.

22:46.539 --> 22:47.627
Anything happens to me,

22:47.670 --> 22:49.237
my brother kills them.

22:49.280 --> 22:50.412
Understand?

22:50.456 --> 22:51.718
Understood.

22:51.761 --> 22:54.503
No one should die here.

22:54.547 --> 22:55.635
We'll see.

22:57.767 --> 22:58.986
One for one. Just like we said.

23:02.685 --> 23:05.558
What are you planning to do
once you get a helicopter?

23:05.601 --> 23:07.429
-First hostage is safe.
You better worry

23:07.473 --> 23:09.475
about what I'll do
if I don't get a helicopter.

23:09.518 --> 23:11.215
-There are two ways
out of this for you.

23:11.259 --> 23:14.349
Give up and I'll make sure
you're treated with respect.

23:17.657 --> 23:19.310
Or you hurt anyone else
in there,

23:19.354 --> 23:21.704
I won't be able to stop
this army from coming in hard.

23:24.794 --> 23:26.317
If that's my fate,

23:26.361 --> 23:29.320
a lot of dead hostages
will be on your hands.

23:29.364 --> 23:30.800
I'm here to make sure
you take the first option...

23:32.062 --> 23:34.282
...to keep you
and everyone inside safe.

23:37.067 --> 23:38.068
Funny you should mention

23:38.112 --> 23:40.244
"everyone inside."

23:40.288 --> 23:42.595
'Cause I got
that list right here.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.207
<i>Mira.</i>

23:46.250 --> 23:49.645
Two LAPD officers
signed in today.

23:49.689 --> 23:51.865
Sergeant Harrelson
and Sergeant Kay.

23:51.908 --> 23:53.867
Amigos of yours, no?

23:53.910 --> 23:56.086
No, I don't know
-who you're talking about.
-You sure?

23:56.130 --> 23:58.262
They were on the same floor
the people escaped from.

23:58.306 --> 24:00.047
You're not

24:00.090 --> 24:01.570
a very good liar.

24:01.614 --> 24:03.746
Look, it's the last one.
Make the trade, Diaz.

24:08.751 --> 24:09.970
You don't
want to answer

24:10.013 --> 24:11.841
'cause you do know them.

24:11.885 --> 24:14.409
I don't have
to tell you what happens

24:14.453 --> 24:16.977
if we find them before
the helicopter gets here.

24:17.020 --> 24:18.239
Let's talk about the other
innocent people

24:18.282 --> 24:20.197
-that you're holding hostage.
-We're done here.

24:20.241 --> 24:22.591
Ticktock.

24:32.296 --> 24:35.169
Warn Hondo and Deacon.
Diaz knows they're inside.

24:38.868 --> 24:41.523
Door's busted.
They beat us here.

24:41.567 --> 24:43.656
Be careful, they might
still be in there.

24:57.278 --> 24:58.714
They have our guns.

25:00.586 --> 25:02.675
Tan says Diaz knows we're here.

25:04.024 --> 25:05.852
Harrelson, Kay!

25:05.895 --> 25:08.289
We know you fools are down
here. If you give up now,

25:08.332 --> 25:11.379
we won't kill you.

25:11.422 --> 25:13.599
Deac, give me your phone.

25:13.642 --> 25:14.687
Give it to me.

25:22.608 --> 25:25.393
Don't shoot.

25:25.436 --> 25:26.699
I'm unarmed.

25:26.742 --> 25:27.830
Where's the other cop?

25:27.874 --> 25:29.658
He jumped with the hostages.

25:29.702 --> 25:31.573
I stayed behind to help.

25:31.617 --> 25:32.618
I don't believe you.

25:54.074 --> 25:56.293
Nothing.
All right.

25:56.337 --> 25:57.599
<i>Vámonos.</i>

26:23.843 --> 26:24.844
Get in.

26:26.976 --> 26:30.240
Everybody get back down on
the floor like I told you, now!

26:30.284 --> 26:32.068
Anyone standing gets shot.

26:32.112 --> 26:34.288
You get the same treatment
as everyone else, cop.

26:34.331 --> 26:36.029
Get down.

26:36.072 --> 26:39.249
That guy has a serious
head wound. Let me help him.

26:39.293 --> 26:41.425
There's a first aid kit
right there behind the desk.

26:41.469 --> 26:43.340
Not my problem.

26:43.384 --> 26:45.604
You don't want a dead hostage
on your hands, man.

26:45.647 --> 26:46.648
You'll lose all the leverage
that you built up.

26:46.692 --> 26:47.649
Think about it.

26:47.693 --> 26:49.477
Let me help him.

27:05.928 --> 27:09.540
I should've listened to you,
got out when I had the chance.

27:09.584 --> 27:11.020
One thing at a time.

27:11.064 --> 27:12.935
Here, let me take
a look at that.

27:22.466 --> 27:23.729
Hello?

27:23.772 --> 27:25.600
Hey, it's Deacon.
Hondo's been taken.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.210
What do you mean "taken"?

27:27.254 --> 27:28.690
Well, I managed to hide.
Hondo gave himself up

27:28.734 --> 27:30.300
so we both wouldn't get caught.

27:30.344 --> 27:32.172
We made it to the gun locker,
but it was empty.

27:32.215 --> 27:33.695
They beat us to it.

27:33.739 --> 27:35.436
They were calling
for us by name.

27:35.479 --> 27:37.003
Not sure how they knew
we were here.

27:37.046 --> 27:38.395
Diaz saw your names
on the sign-in sheet.

27:38.439 --> 27:39.658
He knew you were inside.

27:39.701 --> 27:41.572
Where did they take Hondo?

27:41.616 --> 27:43.313
Courtroom 1, first floor
with the other hostages.

27:43.357 --> 27:44.575
Listen, I know Diaz
set up a deadline.

27:44.619 --> 27:45.838
How much time we got?

27:45.881 --> 27:47.361
20 minutes.

27:47.404 --> 27:48.884
Tell me you guys have a plan.

27:52.453 --> 27:55.064
We're working on a covert entry.

27:55.108 --> 27:57.719
If we're gonna stop these guys
without losing hostages,

27:57.763 --> 27:59.373
we need the element of surprise.

27:59.416 --> 28:01.418
Now, you said they had both
stairwells covered?

28:01.462 --> 28:04.117
Wait a second,
I remember three stairwells.

28:04.160 --> 28:06.119
-Third one might be unguarded.
-All right.
I'll have Chris and Street

28:06.162 --> 28:07.686
talk to the property manager.

28:07.729 --> 28:08.904
I'll check it out,
I'll call you back.

28:08.948 --> 28:10.471
Understood. Stay safe.

28:13.126 --> 28:14.649
Luca?

28:14.693 --> 28:15.824
I need some air.

28:23.005 --> 28:25.138
Hey. I thought
you'd want to know,

28:25.181 --> 28:26.574
the injured woman
from the steps?

28:26.617 --> 28:28.576
It's a nasty laceration,
she'll have headaches

28:28.619 --> 28:30.273
for about a week,
but she's gonna be okay.

28:30.317 --> 28:32.101
Well, at least one thing
went right today.

28:32.145 --> 28:32.885
Yeah, I guess
your extra training with me

28:32.928 --> 28:33.886
really paid off.

28:35.931 --> 28:37.367
You doing okay?

28:37.411 --> 28:40.196
Look, Hondo's in trouble.
It's my fault.

28:40.240 --> 28:42.590
Diaz knows Hondo and Deacon
are inside.

28:42.633 --> 28:45.158
I tried to cover,
he saw right through me.

28:45.201 --> 28:47.116
-I blew it.
-That is not your fault.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.771
There are no good options
in these situations.

28:49.815 --> 28:52.687
Maybe the best thing for me to
do is ask Hicks to take over.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.950
Look, if Hondo and
Deacon make it out okay,

28:54.994 --> 28:56.169
no one will remember or care.

28:56.212 --> 28:58.519
Maybe not. But you will.

28:58.562 --> 29:01.304
Listen, when I was
in Afghanistan,

29:01.348 --> 29:02.523
my little brother Neil
was serving Special Forces

29:02.566 --> 29:04.046
at a nearby outpost.

29:04.090 --> 29:05.613
-I didn't know you had a brother.
-Half brother.

29:05.656 --> 29:07.267
We-we grew up close.

29:07.310 --> 29:09.008
Competitive as hell, but...

29:09.051 --> 29:10.270
...close.

29:10.313 --> 29:12.011
Yeah, I got a brother like that.

29:12.054 --> 29:14.274
After treating
casualty after casualty,

29:14.317 --> 29:16.276
it got to a point where

29:16.319 --> 29:18.452
any time the medevac
returned from outside the wire,

29:18.495 --> 29:22.195
my heart would sink,
worried that it might be Neil.

29:22.238 --> 29:25.851
And one day
my worst fear came true,

29:25.894 --> 29:28.288
when I saw him brought in.

29:28.331 --> 29:32.727
Wounded the way that he was,
I just... froze.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.816
Couldn't do my job.

29:34.860 --> 29:36.775
Someone else had to.

29:36.818 --> 29:38.602
He died later that day.

29:38.646 --> 29:40.300
I'm so sorry.

29:41.605 --> 29:42.824
So the KIA bracelet,

29:42.868 --> 29:44.783
it's for your brother?

29:46.523 --> 29:49.744
I will always regret
not stepping up,

29:49.788 --> 29:51.833
and so will you,

29:51.877 --> 29:55.358
if you don't do everything
you can to help Hondo.

29:56.664 --> 29:57.926
He needs you.

30:11.592 --> 30:14.682
Hey, Jacobs.

30:14.725 --> 30:17.163
With that head injury,
you got to stay with me.

30:18.904 --> 30:21.297
How you feeling?

30:21.341 --> 30:23.604
A little woozy.

30:23.647 --> 30:26.041
Feels like the end of a long
week of football practice.

30:26.085 --> 30:27.695
Oh, yeah.

30:27.738 --> 30:29.610
What position?

30:29.653 --> 30:30.872
Free safety.

30:30.916 --> 30:33.179
Guessing you played?

30:33.222 --> 30:34.658
Tailback.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.102
I'm sorry about how
I handled that earlier.

30:43.145 --> 30:45.147
I sprung that on you
at the last minute

30:45.191 --> 30:47.541
when you were just trying
to do your job. That's on me.

30:47.584 --> 30:49.760
You're not the only one
who second-guesses things.

30:49.804 --> 30:52.851
That woman probably deserves
the money she's asking for.

30:54.853 --> 30:57.290
You know, believe it or not,
I didn't go to law school

30:57.333 --> 31:00.119
to become part of some
city bureaucracy.

31:00.162 --> 31:02.077
I was gonna help
people like her.

31:05.646 --> 31:09.868
If I had known at 22 what
I was gonna face as a cop today,

31:09.911 --> 31:11.478
I'm not sure
I would have become one.

31:14.263 --> 31:17.136
We got to figure out ways
to make all that work together.

31:20.530 --> 31:23.882
Hey. Hang in there.

31:27.363 --> 31:29.713
I might need your help
to get us out of this.

31:29.757 --> 31:31.498
Hey, what do we know?

31:31.541 --> 31:33.892
Spoke with the building's
property manager.

31:33.935 --> 31:36.285
Deac was right--
there is a third stairwell.

31:36.329 --> 31:38.113
It's part of
the new construction.

31:38.157 --> 31:40.115
Seems closed off from
the rest of the building.

31:40.159 --> 31:41.638
It's not ideal,
but maybe we can get there

31:41.682 --> 31:43.118
from the underground garage.

31:43.162 --> 31:45.207
Does the stairwell run
all the way to the roof?

31:57.219 --> 31:58.612
So, you're the cop.

31:58.655 --> 32:00.179
I am.

32:02.181 --> 32:03.747
Let me help you
get what you want.

32:03.791 --> 32:04.966
What we want is a helicopter.

32:05.010 --> 32:06.620
We don't get it,

32:06.663 --> 32:07.969
first one to get a bullet
in the head is you.

32:08.013 --> 32:09.797
That wouldn't be smart.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.103
A lot of cops out there.

32:11.146 --> 32:12.191
That'd be all the excuse
they need.

32:12.234 --> 32:14.541
Scariest thing about me...

32:14.584 --> 32:17.326
I got nothing to lose.

32:17.370 --> 32:19.285
Cop's phone.

32:21.983 --> 32:24.203
Your boys are worried.
They called you a lot.

32:24.246 --> 32:25.639
Call 'em back.
See what they want.

32:27.032 --> 32:29.208
I will call 'em back.

32:32.385 --> 32:33.647
Is this Diaz?

32:33.690 --> 32:35.257
I found something of yours.

32:35.301 --> 32:36.606
You got ten minutes
to get me my chopper

32:36.650 --> 32:38.086
or your boy here dies.

32:38.130 --> 32:38.957
I want to hear his voice.

32:39.000 --> 32:39.958
Ten minutes.

32:40.001 --> 32:41.002
Diaz, listen...

32:44.136 --> 32:46.312
I really hope this plan works.

32:46.355 --> 32:48.618
It has to.

33:00.935 --> 33:02.676
Heads up.
20 seconds out.

33:02.719 --> 33:04.330
Everyone tight?

33:14.601 --> 33:17.125
The team only has three seconds
to jump out onto the roof.

33:17.169 --> 33:18.692
That air must've
done you good.

33:18.735 --> 33:20.128
This is a hell
of a plan, Luca,

33:20.172 --> 33:22.913
having them hitch a ride
on Diaz's chopper.

33:22.957 --> 33:24.176
It's not over yet.

33:42.977 --> 33:44.065
Got it.

33:44.109 --> 33:45.806
26-David, we're in.

33:45.849 --> 33:47.155
Heading into
the rendezvous point.

34:02.518 --> 34:05.043
We're good. It's Deac.

34:07.523 --> 34:09.482
Hey. You all right?

34:09.525 --> 34:11.179
I'm good.

34:15.792 --> 34:17.881
All right.

34:17.925 --> 34:19.492
Follow my lead.
Let's move.

34:27.543 --> 34:28.501
Airship 20 is clear.

34:28.544 --> 34:29.676
Make the call to Diaz.

34:33.158 --> 34:34.550
Your helicopter's here.

34:35.943 --> 34:38.119
All I had to do was threaten
your amigo.

34:38.163 --> 34:39.729
Look, it's fueled
and ready to go.

34:39.773 --> 34:41.644
The four of you can exit
the building now.

34:41.688 --> 34:42.732
Change of plans, homes.

34:42.776 --> 34:44.125
Gonna be eight of us.

34:44.169 --> 34:45.431
It only seats four.

34:45.474 --> 34:46.519
Not today.

34:46.562 --> 34:48.347
We each have a
hostage and a radio.

34:48.390 --> 34:49.870
We come out one at a time.

34:49.913 --> 34:51.176
Anything happens
to one of us

34:51.219 --> 34:52.568
before we're
on that chopper,

34:52.612 --> 34:54.396
it'll be a bloodbath.

35:00.359 --> 35:01.490
We did it.

35:01.534 --> 35:03.362
My team has a way
to end this.

35:03.405 --> 35:04.537
Stick to the plan.

35:18.464 --> 35:19.465
Come on. Come on.

35:19.508 --> 35:20.901
Everyone back.
Let 'em approach.

35:25.471 --> 35:27.473
Come on!

35:29.866 --> 35:33.043
Stay back! Stay back!

35:33.087 --> 35:34.262
Come on, come on!

35:38.658 --> 35:42.401
Come on. Up. Up.

35:42.444 --> 35:43.706
First target's in the bird.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.493
We're on the ground floor
with Deacon.

35:47.536 --> 35:48.885
Listen, these guys are in
communication with each other.

35:48.929 --> 35:50.191
We need to take them
all at once.

35:50.235 --> 35:51.279
Roger.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.675
25-David.

35:55.718 --> 35:57.372
On the opposite end of
the ground floor with Street.

36:03.117 --> 36:05.119
Stand up, cop.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.165
You're with me.

36:10.907 --> 36:12.431
Second target heading your way.

36:12.474 --> 36:13.519
Roger that.

36:14.998 --> 36:16.086
Here they come.

36:16.130 --> 36:17.827
Ten seconds till we engage.

36:17.871 --> 36:19.264
Nine...

36:19.307 --> 36:21.179
Eight. Deac,
you guys gonna be ready?

36:21.222 --> 36:22.484
We're ready,

36:22.528 --> 36:23.529
but we don't have visual
on the third suspect.

36:23.572 --> 36:24.965
Five.

36:25.008 --> 36:26.009
Four.

36:26.053 --> 36:27.794
Three.

36:27.837 --> 36:29.361
-Eyes on the target.
-We're good to go.

36:29.404 --> 36:31.014
Initiate.

36:33.103 --> 36:34.322
Drop your weapon.

36:34.366 --> 36:35.758
-Put it down.
-Hands in the air!

36:35.802 --> 36:36.933
Drop it. On the ground,
right now.

36:36.977 --> 36:39.371
Hands.

36:39.414 --> 36:40.633
Don't move!

36:42.243 --> 36:44.550
Chances are this chopper's not
gonna have a full tank of fuel.

36:44.593 --> 36:46.073
You really think
you're gonna make it

36:46.116 --> 36:47.596
to the border with twice
the passenger load?

37:04.309 --> 37:05.397
Stop right there!

37:13.970 --> 37:15.450
-You good?
-Yeah.

37:17.060 --> 37:19.280
30-David, last suspect down.

37:19.324 --> 37:20.368
We're Code 4 all around.

37:20.412 --> 37:22.022
Hey.

37:22.065 --> 37:24.111
I think your wife tried
to text you a few times.

37:24.154 --> 37:26.548
She probably wants to know
you're all right.

37:26.592 --> 37:28.681
She knows we look out
for each other.

37:28.724 --> 37:30.422
Yeah.

37:32.511 --> 37:35.209
That feel secure?
Yeah.

37:37.211 --> 37:39.561
Hey. Thanks for
your words earlier.

37:39.605 --> 37:41.955
Came right when
I needed them.

37:41.998 --> 37:44.087
You did great leading
the team.

37:44.131 --> 37:46.786
I'm sure it won't be long
before you have one of your own.

37:46.829 --> 37:49.179
Nah, I'm not sure that's
in the cards for me.

37:49.223 --> 37:51.312
Every day, worrying
about the lives of people

37:51.356 --> 37:52.748
under my command...

37:52.792 --> 37:55.011
-I'm not built that way.
-That's too bad.

37:55.055 --> 37:56.926
A lot of officers would love
to have you for a boss.

37:56.970 --> 37:58.319
I know I would.

37:58.363 --> 37:59.538
Thank you.

38:09.199 --> 38:11.506
Fowler.
Sir.

38:13.900 --> 38:15.597
I know you told Luca
about your brother.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.384
You used a tough memory
to inspire.

38:19.427 --> 38:21.168
Kind of surprised myself.

38:21.211 --> 38:22.865
I guess...

38:22.909 --> 38:24.954
feels like there's
a lot of trust around here.

38:24.998 --> 38:26.652
Yeah. I told you,

38:26.695 --> 38:28.654
I handpicked you for a reason.

38:28.697 --> 38:31.309
I knew this team would
need you at some point.

38:31.352 --> 38:34.007
I'm glad you were
here today.

38:34.050 --> 38:35.051
And I think I can speak
for the whole team,

38:35.095 --> 38:36.314
we all are.

38:36.357 --> 38:38.228
Thank you, sir.

38:49.718 --> 38:52.852
I am so glad you made it
out okay, boss.

38:52.895 --> 38:55.158
You're a big reason we did,
big man.

38:55.202 --> 38:56.638
Glad we had you out here.

38:56.682 --> 38:58.466
Hell of a day today, Luca.

38:58.510 --> 38:59.380
I froze for a minute there.
I'm sorry.

38:59.424 --> 39:00.773
Don't be.

39:00.816 --> 39:01.904
You meeting Diaz
on the courthouse stairs

39:01.948 --> 39:04.167
like that... Showed a lot of guts, Luca.

39:04.211 --> 39:06.169
You know why you were chosen
to run point

39:06.213 --> 39:08.607
for the LAPD at the Leadership
Institute in Germany?

39:08.650 --> 39:10.522
Ah, you gonna tell me
I got leadership in my blood

39:10.565 --> 39:12.785
because my dad was
a team leader?

39:12.828 --> 39:14.874
I think I'm happier
being a soldier.

39:14.917 --> 39:16.005
Your dad used
to say the same

39:16.049 --> 39:17.398
exact thing before
his promotion.

39:17.442 --> 39:18.399
Fought it for years.

39:18.443 --> 39:20.967
-I didn't know that.
-Yeah.

39:21.010 --> 39:22.490
Guess I always thought
he wanted it from the start.

39:22.534 --> 39:23.535
The best leaders are
often the ones

39:23.578 --> 39:24.449
that don't want it at first.

39:24.492 --> 39:26.581
They just grow into it.

39:26.625 --> 39:28.104
Hey.

39:28.148 --> 39:29.845
Keep an open mind.

39:31.499 --> 39:32.805
I will.

39:43.032 --> 39:44.686
Hey.

39:44.730 --> 39:47.428
Just think, today was
supposed to be our day off.

39:47.472 --> 39:49.256
Yeah, crazy.

39:49.299 --> 39:51.040
See you tomorrow.

39:51.084 --> 39:53.695
Say your liver's
a match, then what?

39:57.438 --> 39:59.266
Then cross that bridge
when I come to it.

39:59.309 --> 40:01.442
Transplant surgery...

40:01.486 --> 40:03.444
What if something goes wrong?

40:03.488 --> 40:05.620
You could lose your job,

40:05.664 --> 40:07.666
or you could die.

40:09.319 --> 40:11.409
You think I don't know
how screwed up this is?

40:13.280 --> 40:15.238
She only has me.

40:25.205 --> 40:27.250
I just remember
everything I went through

40:27.294 --> 40:28.861
trying to have Ariel.

40:28.904 --> 40:31.037
I don't know if I have it
in me again.

40:31.080 --> 40:32.255
But the child isn't mine.

40:32.299 --> 40:33.300
Karen?

40:33.343 --> 40:34.649
You told me she was.

40:34.693 --> 40:35.998
What am I supposed to...

40:36.042 --> 40:36.999
Hi.

40:37.043 --> 40:38.784
I'm, uh, Chris Alonso.

40:38.827 --> 40:40.220
I work with your son.

40:40.263 --> 40:42.483
Oh, of course.

40:42.527 --> 40:45.007
The Chris I heard so much about
when I was living with Jimmy.

40:45.051 --> 40:47.096
He never said
how cute you were.

40:48.707 --> 40:49.664
He's told me a lot about you.

40:50.926 --> 40:52.711
I'm sure he did.

40:52.754 --> 40:55.061
Hope he said we had
some good times, too.

40:55.104 --> 40:57.846
Your doctor asked him
to get tested

40:57.890 --> 41:00.109
so he can maybe donate
his liver.

41:00.153 --> 41:01.894
What?

41:01.937 --> 41:03.809
No, I don't want Jimmy
to do that.

41:03.852 --> 41:06.159
I... These
damn doctors.

41:06.202 --> 41:07.334
I begged them

41:07.377 --> 41:08.596
to leave my kid out of it.

41:08.640 --> 41:10.032
They don't listen.

41:10.076 --> 41:11.643
No, I think that's
exactly what you want.

41:11.686 --> 41:13.253
You just didn't want to be
the one to ask.

41:16.082 --> 41:17.823
I'm sure that you've heard

41:17.866 --> 41:19.781
plenty of horror stories
about me,

41:19.825 --> 41:22.523
but I would never do anything
to hurt my son.

41:22.567 --> 41:23.611
An operation like this,

41:23.655 --> 41:25.004
you're asking him
to throw away

41:25.047 --> 41:27.659
everything he's built
for himself.

41:27.702 --> 41:30.357
I didn't ask him for anything.

41:30.400 --> 41:31.532
I came here to keep it that way.

41:31.576 --> 41:33.360
And who are you to make demands?

41:33.403 --> 41:34.535
I know you're still using.

41:34.579 --> 41:35.928
I can see it on your face,

41:35.971 --> 41:38.104
even if your son
doesn't want to.

41:38.147 --> 41:40.846
Fact is, if you stay sober
for six months,

41:40.889 --> 41:42.978
you can get yourself back
onto the registry.

41:43.022 --> 41:44.676
But you already know that.

41:44.719 --> 41:46.199
You think you found
a shortcut.

41:46.242 --> 41:47.940
So this is
what you're gonna do.

41:47.983 --> 41:49.463
You're gonna tell him you don't
need anything from him

41:49.507 --> 41:51.378
except his support.

41:51.421 --> 41:53.206
You don't want
to fight me on this.

41:53.249 --> 41:54.860
Hmm.

41:57.340 --> 42:00.343
You must really love my Jimmy.
