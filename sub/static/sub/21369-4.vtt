00:05.880 --> 00:09.330
Raven: Raven's Home was filmed in
front of a live studio audience.

00:09.330 --> 00:10.250
(doorknob clicks)

00:11.290 --> 00:12.540
That's Dad! Get ready!

00:12.540 --> 00:14.330
Okay!

00:14.330 --> 00:15.920
All:
Surprise!

00:19.420 --> 00:21.290
Aw!
You guys shouldn't have!

00:22.420 --> 00:24.790
Uh, we didn't, Chels,
this is for Devon.

00:24.790 --> 00:27.750
I know. I just-- I never had
a surprise party before,

00:27.750 --> 00:30.500
so I wanted to see
what it felt like.

00:30.500 --> 00:33.250
It felt like you were
yelling a hug at me.

00:35.170 --> 00:37.330
All right, everybody,
back to your positions.

00:37.330 --> 00:39.670
Your father thinks that he
is the king of surprises,

00:39.670 --> 00:41.960
but you know what? I'm not
lettin' him move to Texas,

00:41.960 --> 00:44.250
until I give him
his second heart attack.

00:45.620 --> 00:47.250
When did Dad have
his first heart attack?

00:47.250 --> 00:49.290
When I told him
y'all were twins.

00:52.330 --> 00:53.880
Shh! I hear him coming!

00:55.380 --> 00:57.170
All:
Surprise!

00:59.830 --> 01:02.290
-How in the world...? -I'm sorry, it
just felt so good the first time,

01:02.290 --> 01:05.080
I had to do it again.
(giggles)

01:05.080 --> 01:09.000
On a side note, Rae, your energy...
little low.

01:10.460 --> 01:12.210
Guys, he's gonna
be here any second.

01:12.210 --> 01:15.620
Right, so get in position.
Chelsea! Down...

01:18.670 --> 01:22.330
Okay. I don't know where he is.
He's never late.

Hmm, Rae, this cake
is delicious.

02:32.960 --> 02:36.210
Thank you. No one picks
a store-bought cake like me!

02:36.210 --> 02:38.460
-Good one, good one.
-Hey, Dad,

02:38.460 --> 02:39.880
I got you a goin' away gift.

02:39.880 --> 02:42.500
It's from our favorite
deep dish pizza place.

02:42.500 --> 02:44.210
Two more punches
and you get a free slice.

02:45.380 --> 02:47.380
Thanks, Book, but I don't think
they're gonna have

02:47.380 --> 02:49.290
a Chicago's Best Pizza in Texas.

02:50.790 --> 02:52.210
Ha ha ha.

02:52.210 --> 02:54.290
Then I should probably
hold onto that, heh.

02:56.790 --> 02:57.920
I made you a pop-up book,

02:57.920 --> 02:59.000
so you'll remember

02:59.000 --> 03:00.080
all the fun things

03:00.080 --> 03:01.170
we did together.

03:01.170 --> 03:02.420
Aww...

03:02.420 --> 03:04.920
Wow, this is amazing!

03:04.920 --> 03:06.330
-Thank you, sweetheart.
-Yeah.

03:06.330 --> 03:08.620
This was the time you took us
to the petting zoo, and Booker

03:08.620 --> 03:10.210
got his head
stuck in a bucket.

03:10.210 --> 03:12.540
(laughs)

03:12.540 --> 03:13.670
And this was the time
you took us

03:13.670 --> 03:14.750
to the Natural History Museum

03:14.750 --> 03:15.790
and Booker got his head

03:15.790 --> 03:17.420
stuck in a dinosaur.

03:17.420 --> 03:19.290
(laughing)

03:19.290 --> 03:21.620
And this was the time
you took us to the state fair

03:21.620 --> 03:22.880
and Booker went to the bathroom

03:22.880 --> 03:24.080
and got his head stuck in the--

03:24.080 --> 03:25.790
Okay! Okay! Everybody knows

03:25.790 --> 03:28.330
where I got my head stuck!

03:28.330 --> 03:29.330
You had your head stuck
in a toilet?

03:29.330 --> 03:31.000
What's wrong with you, boy?

03:32.710 --> 03:34.330
Not my fault.
I got a big head.

03:34.330 --> 03:37.380
Ha! You ain't got to tell me.
I went through 12 hours of labor

03:37.380 --> 03:38.290
with that head.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.500
I love it, Nia, thank you.

03:41.500 --> 03:43.380
-Of course.
-Oh! I almost forgot!

03:46.080 --> 03:49.330
Haha!
Look who I found!

03:49.330 --> 03:52.500
Ohh, Admiral Snuggles!
(giggles)

03:52.500 --> 03:54.080
I remember this bear.

03:54.080 --> 03:55.790
You won him for us
at Navy Pier.

03:55.790 --> 03:59.170
Oh, yeah, right before I got my head
stuck in the cotton candy machine.

04:00.880 --> 04:03.420
Seriously boy,
what is wrong with you?

04:05.080 --> 04:08.330
Well, I was thinkin', since I'm
movin', he can live with you.

04:08.330 --> 04:11.210
Don't worry, Dad.
I'll take good care of him.

04:11.210 --> 04:13.290
And when he forgets to, I will.

04:15.250 --> 04:17.080
Man, this is all movin' so fast.

04:17.080 --> 04:19.420
I mean, it felt like just
last week I was interviewin',

04:19.420 --> 04:21.170
and, now I'm movin' away.

04:21.170 --> 04:23.000
Dad, you're gonna be
the weatherman

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
on the biggest morning show
in Dallas.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.420
You have to go for it.

04:27.710 --> 04:29.380
I'm gonna miss you.

04:29.380 --> 04:31.580
Maybe we should put a TV
in my room so I can watch

04:31.580 --> 04:34.170
-whenever I get sad--
-You're not gettin' a TV, Book.

04:35.960 --> 04:37.420
It was worth a shot.

04:39.080 --> 04:41.500
Look, I better get goin', Rae.
It's-- It's gettin' late.

04:41.500 --> 04:44.000
I got a long drive
ahead of me tomorrow.

04:49.380 --> 04:50.670
I love you guys.

04:52.380 --> 04:54.250
We love you.

04:56.290 --> 04:58.290
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye.

04:58.290 --> 04:59.420
Bye.

05:02.420 --> 05:04.330
Well... this is it.

05:04.330 --> 05:06.290
I guess so.

05:06.290 --> 05:09.620
Man, I've never missed one of
my weekends with the kids.

05:09.620 --> 05:11.500
Just wish that I could wait
till Monday to leave.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.460
Me, too.
I had plans...

05:16.330 --> 05:18.460
(sigh) Man, so did we. I
mean, the kids and I,

05:18.460 --> 05:19.670
we were gonna watch
a scary movie,

05:19.670 --> 05:22.420
make some
of my super spicy chili...

05:22.420 --> 05:23.620
everything you hate doin'.

05:24.920 --> 05:27.540
Not gonna lie, I was happy
to lose those in the divorce.

05:29.290 --> 05:32.540
You know, even though things didn't
work out between us, Rae, uh...

05:32.540 --> 05:34.500
I'm glad we're still friends.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.380
Me too.

05:36.380 --> 05:39.210
You sure you're gonna be okay
doin' this on your own?

05:39.210 --> 05:41.210
Come on, now, Devon,
you've been to my house.

05:41.210 --> 05:44.000
I'm not alone.
I'm never alone.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.750
I'd kill for five minutes alone.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.420
We're gonna be okay.

05:51.380 --> 05:52.670
Bye, Rae.

05:52.670 --> 05:53.830
Bye, Devon.

05:57.420 --> 06:00.290
-Hey, Rae, how about one
last-- -Bye, Devon!

06:03.920 --> 06:05.500
Hey, Chels, the kids
in bed already?

06:05.500 --> 06:06.920
Yeah.
Are you okay?

06:06.920 --> 06:09.380
Well, it depends, uh,
did you throw that cake away?

06:09.380 --> 06:11.330
-No.
-Then I'm good.

06:12.620 --> 06:15.330
I'm just a little worried
about Booker and Nia, you know?

06:15.330 --> 06:17.330
It's a big change.
I hope they're gonna be okay.

06:22.170 --> 06:23.250
Dad's gone.

06:24.460 --> 06:26.290
Things are never
gonna be the same.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.290
Oh, Chels,
I just saw the kids,

06:32.290 --> 06:33.920
and they were upset
that Devon is leaving.

06:33.920 --> 06:36.460
Ugh!
I hate seeing them this way.

06:36.460 --> 06:39.330
Well, of course, Rae, it's awful
seeing your kids hurting.

06:39.330 --> 06:42.380
When Garret left, God,
it was so hard on Levi.

06:42.380 --> 06:43.790
How'd you help him?

06:43.790 --> 06:46.540
Oh, well, whenever he'd get upset
I'd, you know, do little things

06:46.540 --> 06:48.420
to take his mind off of it.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.380
Oh!
Well, that's a great idea.

06:52.380 --> 06:54.460
I can do fun things with the kids
all weekend to keep them distracted

06:54.460 --> 06:55.880
from being sad.

06:55.880 --> 06:59.210
Yeah-- Oh! You know a
really awesome distraction?

06:59.210 --> 07:02.920
You guys can help me
clean up this living room.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.330
Right?

07:04.330 --> 07:06.290
-I'll help you.
-Well, thanks, Rae.

07:06.290 --> 07:08.290
-Yeah. First I'm gonna clean
up this cake... -Yeah.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.000
and then I'm gonna clean up
that ice cream in there.

07:16.880 --> 07:20.120
-Hey, Mom! -(gasp) Oh--
where'd you come from?

07:20.120 --> 07:23.330
Well, according to you and Dad,
a long weekend in Hawaii.

07:25.170 --> 07:27.210
That's why
my middle name's Mahalo!

07:30.620 --> 07:33.460
Hey, Levi, why do you have on
Admiral Snuggles' hat?

07:33.460 --> 07:37.210
The real question is,
who's Admiral Snuggles,

07:37.210 --> 07:39.290
and why is he out of uniform?

07:40.460 --> 07:42.210
I don't know. Why don't
you go and ask him?

07:42.210 --> 07:43.830
He's over there in the box
by the coffee table.

07:43.830 --> 07:46.120
There's no box
by the coffee table.

07:48.830 --> 07:51.420
Oh, well. I'm sure the kids
took him to their room.

07:51.420 --> 07:53.250
-They love that bear.
-They do?

07:55.040 --> 07:56.920
Yeah. Now that Devon's gone,
I'm sure they're gonna be

07:56.920 --> 07:58.880
fightin' over who's gonna
sleep with it.

07:58.880 --> 08:01.790
Oh, Rae, I don't think
you have to worry about that.

08:03.620 --> 08:05.330
Levi, can I see you
in the living room?

08:07.080 --> 08:10.380
Levi, I threw that box away.
I thought it was trash!

08:10.380 --> 08:12.790
We gotta find that bear before
the twins find out it's gone.

08:12.790 --> 08:14.250
Don't worry, Mom,
I'll help you.

08:14.250 --> 08:16.460
Okay. Well, let's go
check the dumpster, huh?

08:16.460 --> 08:19.670
Mom! I'm the admiral!
I give the orders!

08:21.670 --> 08:23.420
Let's go check the dumpster.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.420
Aye, aye, son!

08:32.790 --> 08:33.960
(knocking on door)

08:33.960 --> 08:35.040
Hey, can I come in?

08:35.040 --> 08:36.880
Actually, I kind of
wanna be alone.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.210
Yeah, me too.

08:42.170 --> 08:45.960
(sigh) Dad's only been gone a day
and I already miss him so much.

08:45.960 --> 08:49.960
Hey, you two!
(singing) It's Saturday morning!

08:49.960 --> 08:52.620
Ow!
Who's ready for the weekend?

08:54.500 --> 08:55.960
Why is Mom acting so weird?

08:55.960 --> 08:58.750
Is there a hidden camera in here?
Are we being Mom'd?

08:59.880 --> 09:01.460
What are y'all doin'
just sittin' around?

09:01.460 --> 09:03.380
Talking about Dad.

09:03.380 --> 09:05.040
This was supposed to be
our weekend with him.

09:05.040 --> 09:08.620
Yeah, right about now we'd be
makin' his super spicy chili.

09:08.620 --> 09:10.710
Oh! That's okay,
we can do that today.

09:10.710 --> 09:13.420
We're gonna make Dad's
super spicy chili.

09:13.420 --> 09:16.170
Yeah. Yeah, and then we can
watch a super scary movie!

09:16.170 --> 09:17.540
The scarier the better!

09:17.540 --> 09:19.540
-But you hate that stuff.
-No, I don't, I love that stuff.

09:19.540 --> 09:21.710
I was real sad
when I lost it in the divorce.

09:23.460 --> 09:26.420
Cool! We'll do the whole weekend
we were gonna do with Dad!

09:26.420 --> 09:29.250
I love it, yes!
And then no one will be sad!

09:29.250 --> 09:32.830
We're gonna have a happy,
super fun Dad's weekend,

09:32.830 --> 09:38.330
with special guest host
M to the, O to the, M to the,

-Mm-hmm.

09:57.120 --> 09:58.830
It's how we start off
every weekend with Dad.

09:58.830 --> 10:02.380
Actually, we start with Dad telling
us how good music used to be.

10:04.120 --> 10:07.830
You wanna hear good music? I got
three words for you: Boyz N Motion.

10:11.210 --> 10:13.880
I got three words for you:
Who is that?

10:15.830 --> 10:17.080
Just serve the chili.

10:18.460 --> 10:20.580
-We followed Dad's recipe exactly.
-Yeah.

10:21.790 --> 10:24.580
Booker, how much hot sauce
did you put in here?

10:24.580 --> 10:25.790
The whole bottle?

10:25.790 --> 10:27.120
What were you thinking?

10:27.120 --> 10:29.330
You're supposed to put
a bottle and a half!

10:29.330 --> 10:31.290
Come on.

10:31.290 --> 10:35.170
Oh... I-- I like how you just-- just
poured it in there, no measurements,

10:35.170 --> 10:38.330
no little teaspoons, just gonna-- just
gonna pour the whole thing in there.

10:38.330 --> 10:40.620
If it's too spicy for you,
have some milk.

10:40.620 --> 10:43.040
-That helps. -Oh, well,
I'm not gonna need it,

10:43.040 --> 10:44.420
because I love
spicy food.

10:44.420 --> 10:47.960
Lemme just get a whiff
of this real quick-- (sniffs)

10:47.960 --> 10:50.500
Aah! Aah!

10:50.500 --> 10:52.330
Aah!

10:52.330 --> 10:53.960
-I can't see!
-Mom, you-- you okay?

10:53.960 --> 10:55.960
I can't see!
I can't see!

10:55.960 --> 10:57.920
I'm chili blind!

10:57.920 --> 11:01.250
(giggles)
Mom, you're so funny!

11:03.420 --> 11:06.330
Oh, I'd better put some milk on
it, I gotta put some milk on it.

11:09.290 --> 11:10.380
Mom?

11:10.380 --> 11:12.460
Whoa! That's the hottest
hot sauce you can buy

11:12.460 --> 11:13.710
without a prescription!

11:13.710 --> 11:16.960
(screams)

11:24.380 --> 11:28.170
(gasp) Great. Looks like the
garbageman hasn't picked up today.

11:28.170 --> 11:30.330
Smells like
he hasn't picked up ever.

11:31.920 --> 11:33.290
Let's just hope
the bear is in here.

11:33.290 --> 11:34.420
Come on,
I'll give you a boost.

11:34.420 --> 11:36.040
That won't be necessary.

11:36.040 --> 11:37.500
I'm not goin' in there.

11:37.500 --> 11:40.330
Well, neither am I.

11:40.330 --> 11:43.420
Okay. Let's settle this
like we always do.

11:43.420 --> 11:45.120
-Okay.
-Heads or tails?

11:45.120 --> 11:46.830
-Heads.
-I was thinkin' tails.

11:46.830 --> 11:49.170
-Sorry.
-(groans)

11:49.170 --> 11:51.420
Levi!
You're so good at that.

11:52.710 --> 11:55.000
All right.
Well, here it goes.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.580
Oh, Levi!
I see it, it's right here!

11:56.580 --> 11:58.670
(cries out) Levi!

12:00.620 --> 12:01.790
Levi!

12:03.500 --> 12:05.620
Levi!

12:05.620 --> 12:07.670
I found Admiral Snuggles!
(giggles)

12:07.670 --> 12:09.290
He was right next to this wig--

12:09.290 --> 12:12.500
-(squeaking noise) -Okay, I-- I
think the wig's moving, Le--

12:12.500 --> 12:15.210
Okay, it's got teeth, Levi,
it's got-- (screaming)

12:22.880 --> 12:25.210
Guess you won't
be needin' this hat back.

12:30.170 --> 12:32.170
Maybe chili
was too much for Mom.

12:32.170 --> 12:33.420
What makes you say that?

12:33.420 --> 12:35.330
(toilet flushing)

12:41.330 --> 12:43.120
Oh, baby.

12:47.920 --> 12:51.540
Ooh!
Okay, uh... (clears throat)

12:51.540 --> 12:55.380
Mm.
What we watchin'?

12:55.380 --> 12:58.500
Ooh, ooh, here it is.
Evil Elf 3.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.080
Yes.
That movie is so scary,

13:00.080 --> 13:01.670
they recommend
you watch it on a Friday,

13:01.670 --> 13:03.830
so you'll have the whole
weekend to recover.

13:05.460 --> 13:08.500
-Well, I mean, how scary can an elf be?
-(giggles)

13:08.500 --> 13:12.000
He's so small!
But so mean!

13:14.210 --> 13:16.670
Tell me when it's over!

13:16.670 --> 13:18.500
-Tell me when it's over!
-(chainsaw whirring)

13:18.500 --> 13:20.420
(evil laughing)

13:22.290 --> 13:24.250
Nia, the poor thing's shaking.

13:27.960 --> 13:30.830
Mom, I'm sure Aunt Chelsea
will be home any minute.

13:30.830 --> 13:33.120
Yeah, and we're right down
the hall if you need us.

13:33.120 --> 13:34.380
You gonna be okay?

13:35.920 --> 13:38.290
Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna be fine.
I'm a grown woman.

13:38.290 --> 13:39.830
It was just a movie.

13:41.420 --> 13:44.960
Hey, kids? Could you just-- Could
you just keep the door cracked?

13:44.960 --> 13:46.330
You know, for Aunt Chels.

13:48.330 --> 13:49.330
(door squeaking)

13:52.380 --> 13:54.540
(evil laughing)

14:00.960 --> 14:02.250
Tape!

14:02.250 --> 14:04.080
Tape!

14:04.080 --> 14:05.210
Okay, I need more tape.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.580
-That's the last of it.
-I think I can save him!

14:09.580 --> 14:13.040
Mom... you have to let him go.

14:14.380 --> 14:16.620
No! I just need more tape!

14:17.580 --> 14:19.330
Oh, I think there's more tape
in my bedroom.

14:19.330 --> 14:23.170
I'll go. I'm smaller. Don't
want to wake up Auntie Rae.

14:28.420 --> 14:31.040
(door squeaking)

14:39.880 --> 14:42.460
Get a grip, girl.

14:42.460 --> 14:44.250
You're a grown woman.
Ain't nobody in here.

14:51.040 --> 14:54.170
(digging through drawer)

14:54.170 --> 14:57.420
(gasping)
It's the elf!

15:01.250 --> 15:04.830
(digging through drawer)

15:04.830 --> 15:06.420
Okay, you know what?

15:08.000 --> 15:11.620
(digging through drawer)

15:15.330 --> 15:16.670
Not in my house!

15:16.670 --> 15:18.420
(pillow hitting Levi)

15:18.420 --> 15:19.960
Aah!

15:24.420 --> 15:27.710
Uh, I think there's been
a misunderstanding?

15:28.920 --> 15:30.330
My bad.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.830
What's goin' on?

15:31.830 --> 15:34.000
Well, I thought he was the
evil elf from the movie.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.250
Rae, you hate scary movies, why
would you be watching that?

15:36.250 --> 15:39.210
We were trying to have a Dad's
weekend with Mom, but...

15:39.210 --> 15:40.880
-it's not working.
-No, no, it's working.

15:40.880 --> 15:44.290
Mom, your stomach's upset
and you're terrified.

15:44.290 --> 15:45.880
You can't take
much more of this.

15:45.880 --> 15:47.290
No, no, no, no, no,
please, you guys,

15:47.290 --> 15:49.500
I know today wasn't perfect,
but don't give up on me yet.

15:49.500 --> 15:52.500
Seriously, the weekend isn't over,
we can turn this thing around.

15:52.500 --> 15:55.420
Um, guys, I know this might not be
the best time to bring this up,

15:55.420 --> 15:58.500
but you know that bear your
dad got you at Navy Pier?

15:58.500 --> 16:02.210
-Yeah, that was a really fun day.
-One of the best.

16:02.210 --> 16:03.880
Okay! Okay! Perfect.

16:03.880 --> 16:06.460
That's what we'll do. First thing in
the morning, we're going to Navy Pier.

16:06.460 --> 16:07.830
And we'll go with you!

16:07.830 --> 16:11.290
That way we can get
another Admiral Snuggles.

16:11.290 --> 16:14.580
Well, I really wish you'd thought of
that before I went dumpster diving.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.790
We can go on that new ride,
the Wind Tickler.

16:17.790 --> 16:21.920
(gasp) The Wind Tickler.
Now that sounds fun.

16:21.920 --> 16:23.000
This is not fun.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.580
This is not fun at all!

16:34.250 --> 16:37.080
Man, I'm so glad
we're doing this!

16:38.120 --> 16:40.880
Whoa. Everything looks
so small down there!

16:40.880 --> 16:43.290
I can see the whole park
from here!

16:45.080 --> 16:49.120
-Isn't this great? -Yeah, mm-hmm.
How high are we?

16:49.120 --> 16:50.290
(bird cries)

16:50.290 --> 16:52.380
Is that
a bird?

16:52.380 --> 16:54.960
-(bird cries)
-Are we bird high?

16:54.960 --> 16:57.420
-(Nia giggling)
-Bird high is too high!

17:05.210 --> 17:06.620
Mom! Look!

17:06.620 --> 17:09.500
-There it is! Another Admiral Snuggles!
-(Chelsea gasps)

17:09.500 --> 17:11.420
Step right up
and be the lucky player!

17:11.420 --> 17:13.250
Make a basket,
win a prize!

17:13.250 --> 17:15.290
It's easy, anyone can do it.

17:15.290 --> 17:16.620
How much for the bear?

17:16.620 --> 17:18.250
-One dollar!
-Oh, great, we'll take him.

17:18.250 --> 17:21.080
-Uh-- No can do, pretty lady.
You gotta win that teddy!

17:21.080 --> 17:22.290
Dollar a shot!

17:23.830 --> 17:24.960
Hit me!

17:24.960 --> 17:28.250
-Come on, Mom. You got this.
-Yeah.

17:30.380 --> 17:34.460
Ooh, so close. Another
dollar gets you another try.

17:34.460 --> 17:35.670
But that was a perfect shot.

17:35.670 --> 17:38.250
If it was perfect,
it would've gone in.

17:39.710 --> 17:41.830
You're not a very happy person,
are you?

17:43.080 --> 17:45.670
I work at a carnival.
What you think?

17:54.580 --> 17:57.120
Okay. All I have to
do is pull this cord,

17:57.120 --> 18:00.210
and we drop 150 feet
at 60 miles per hour!

18:00.210 --> 18:02.080
-(Booker and Nia giggle)
-Count me down, bro.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.830
100, 99, 98--

18:04.830 --> 18:06.580
-Let's start at five.
-Oh!

18:06.580 --> 18:09.960
-Five... -Both: Four...
three... two--

18:09.960 --> 18:12.540
I can't do it! I don't wanna do it!
I can't do it!

18:14.420 --> 18:16.960
-Mom, you okay?
-Well, a plane just flew by,

18:16.960 --> 18:18.500
and I caught a piece
of the in-flight movie,

18:18.500 --> 18:20.290
so no!
I'm not okay!

18:21.710 --> 18:22.960
Mom, mom, mom,
what are you doing?

18:22.960 --> 18:24.380
I'm tryin' to get
to the pole!

18:24.380 --> 18:25.210
Mom?

18:26.880 --> 18:28.120
Mom--

18:30.120 --> 18:32.790
Uhh! I'm about to get
to this pole right quick, ow!

18:32.790 --> 18:34.080
Mom--

18:34.080 --> 18:35.880
No, no, no, I don't why
I let y'all talk me into this.

18:35.880 --> 18:37.790
If we die,
you're both grounded.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.420
Here we go.

18:46.380 --> 18:47.880
Oh!

18:47.880 --> 18:50.750
Aw, that was really close.
Even closer than the last one.

18:50.750 --> 18:52.880
Not as close as the one
two times before.

18:52.880 --> 18:55.380
You've been really close
on a lotta these.

18:55.380 --> 18:58.380
Listen, I'm goin' again.
Give me the rock.

18:59.880 --> 19:01.620
Something's up with this game.

19:01.620 --> 19:05.500
-I'm not givin' you the rock.
-Give. Me. The rock!

19:05.500 --> 19:08.710
Both of you stop callin' it "the
rock", you sound ridiculous.

19:15.380 --> 19:16.460
Uh!

19:16.460 --> 19:19.330
He's been cheating
this whole time.

19:19.330 --> 19:21.330
Step right up!
Anybody else!

19:21.330 --> 19:23.460
It's easier
than she's makin' it look!

19:23.460 --> 19:25.920
What?
Listen, I've got one dollar!

19:25.920 --> 19:27.710
I'm winnin' that bear!

19:27.710 --> 19:29.290
Here we go.

19:29.290 --> 19:31.250
Whoa!

19:31.250 --> 19:33.710
He rigged the game!
You can't win!

19:33.710 --> 19:36.960
But I have to, Levi,
for Booker and for Nia!

19:36.960 --> 19:38.920
Give me the ball.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.380
I can do this.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.500
-Huh!
-Ohh!

19:47.500 --> 19:49.620
-Grab the bear and run!
-What?

19:49.620 --> 19:51.460
Oh! Levi!

19:57.420 --> 19:58.710
Mom, you have to let go!

19:58.710 --> 20:00.380
Uh-uh, uh-uh, you don't
tell me what to do!

20:00.380 --> 20:02.330
I tell you what to do,
I'm the mama.

20:03.420 --> 20:05.170
Then we're stuck up here.

20:05.170 --> 20:08.000
No, we're not stuck. We just have to
wait for the pier rescue helicopter.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.380
There's always a pier rescue
helicopter, isn't there?

20:12.380 --> 20:15.290
Mom, if you didn't wanna do
this, then why are we up here?

20:16.620 --> 20:19.250
Because I didn't want you
to be sad that your dad left.

20:21.040 --> 20:23.080
But we are sad.

20:23.080 --> 20:24.540
Dad's gone.

20:24.540 --> 20:26.830
Things are never
gonna be the same.

20:28.670 --> 20:33.210
You're right. And I shouldn't have
tried to keep you from being sad.

20:33.210 --> 20:35.420
I was wrong.

20:35.420 --> 20:37.330
Listen, it's okay to be sad.

20:37.330 --> 20:39.290
He's gone.

20:39.290 --> 20:40.460
I miss him.

20:40.460 --> 20:42.250
Me too.

20:42.250 --> 20:44.040
Me too.

20:44.040 --> 20:47.420
But hey... you guys are gonna
text him, and you're gonna visit.

20:47.420 --> 20:49.500
We're gonna find a way to
make this work. Right?

20:50.500 --> 20:51.540
Right?

20:52.620 --> 20:53.960
Okay.

21:02.830 --> 21:06.920
I'm ready to pull that cord.

21:06.920 --> 21:08.290
Here we go.

21:10.040 --> 21:12.460
That's weird. I pulled the
cord and nothing even--

21:12.460 --> 21:16.080
(all screaming)

21:24.040 --> 21:25.710
That was epic!

21:25.710 --> 21:26.920
Let's do it again!

21:26.920 --> 21:29.790
-You down, Mom?
-Haha! Ah-ha!

21:29.790 --> 21:31.290
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!
Get away from me!

21:31.290 --> 21:33.080
Get me outta here!
Get me outta here!

21:33.080 --> 21:34.330
Mom, he's trying to!

21:36.330 --> 21:37.540
I lost my shoe!

21:37.540 --> 21:40.080
Leave it !
He's gaining on us!

21:40.080 --> 21:41.880
(screaming)

21:46.620 --> 21:49.170
Dad, you should've seen us
on that ride.

21:49.170 --> 21:50.290
It was insane!

21:50.290 --> 21:52.290
But Mom handled it
like a boss.

21:52.290 --> 21:54.290
She freaked out, didn't she?

21:54.290 --> 21:55.790
Clung to the post
for 45 minutes.

21:57.250 --> 21:59.620
Oh, man, I wish I'd been there.

21:59.620 --> 22:02.210
You know, watchin' from the ground.
I hate heights.

22:04.120 --> 22:06.960
Well, it looks like you survived
your first Dad's weekend.

22:06.960 --> 22:10.420
Barely. You know what? I'm
done doin' dad stuff.

22:10.420 --> 22:11.620
I'm doin' Mom weekend
next weekend.

22:11.620 --> 22:14.380
Why? 'Cause no one's
more fun than me.

22:16.170 --> 22:19.670
That's why I live here. Right?
Well, that and splittin' the rent.

22:22.210 --> 22:23.500
-Bye, Dad.
-We love you.

22:23.500 --> 22:25.670
