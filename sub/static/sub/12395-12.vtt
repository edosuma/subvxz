08:42.790 --> 08:43.939
AND I'M TAKING EVERYBODY
WITH ME INTO THE STRATOSPHERE.

08:43.990 --> 08:44.945
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, HANK?

08:44.990 --> 08:46.048
- YEAH, I'M GETTING FITTED

08:46.090 --> 08:47.284
FOR MY SPACESUIT
LATER TODAY.

08:47.320 --> 08:49.117
- EVERYBODY KNOWS HANK.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.754
EVERYBODY, THEY KNOW HIM AS
THE BEST CAMERAMAN IN THE WORLD.

08:51.790 --> 08:53.849
I ALSO KNOW HIM AS THE MAN
WHO MAKES ME LUNCH, HUH?

08:53.900 --> 08:55.094
MR. BAKED POTATO, HMM?

08:55.130 --> 08:58.167
WAH, WAH, WAH.

08:58.200 --> 09:00.259
- UH, EXCUSE ME
JUST ONE SECOND,

09:00.300 --> 09:01.938
MY FELLOW BACHELORS

09:01.970 --> 09:04.302
AND YOU AND ALSO YOU.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.601
- SHAWN,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

09:09.650 --> 09:12.005
- UM, GUS AND I
ARE INVESTIGATING

09:12.050 --> 09:13.745
TODD KRAMER'S CAR CRASH.

09:13.780 --> 09:15.771
- WHY ARE YOU WEARING A TIE
AND A HEART?

09:15.820 --> 09:20.757
- I--WHY ARE YOU WEARING HAIR?

09:20.790 --> 09:22.929
AND SHOES?

09:22.960 --> 09:24.120
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

09:24.160 --> 09:25.354
- TURNS OUT
YOU WERE RIGHT, OKAY?

09:25.390 --> 09:26.425
THE GUY'S CAR WAS TAMPERED WITH.
YOU HAPPY NOW?

09:26.460 --> 09:28.052
- TODD'S PARENTS SAID
HE'D BEEN AT THIS ADDRESS

09:28.100 --> 09:29.124
FOR THE LAST TWO WEEKS,

09:29.160 --> 09:30.889
SO WERE HERE TO TALK
TO THE OWNER, JAY GIANUKOS.

09:30.930 --> 09:32.124
LET'S GO.

09:32.170 --> 09:33.762
- I DON'T THINK
THAT'S GONNA BE POSSIBLE.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.597
LOOK, UH,
I'LL EXPLAIN LATER,

09:35.640 --> 09:38.803
BUT FOR NOW YOU DON'T KNOW ME
AND I'M VERY VERY SINGLE, OKAY?

09:38.840 --> 09:41.877
- YOU CAN'T RUN OFF
LIKE THAT, DOCTOR.

09:41.910 --> 09:43.138
NOW COME ON.

09:43.180 --> 09:44.841
YOU'RE NEEDED AT THE POOL
FOR THE SINGLE MINGLE.

09:44.880 --> 09:46.302
- COPY THAT.

09:46.350 --> 09:49.114
SHH.

09:49.150 --> 09:51.812
- DOCTOR?

09:51.850 --> 09:54.683
- SINGLE MINGLE.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.256
- BASED ON TODD'S TESTIMONIAL,

09:56.290 --> 09:57.882
HE WAS SCARED
OF SOMEBODY ON THE INSIDE.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.124
- ON THE INSIDE.

09:59.160 --> 10:00.752
- YEAH, WHICH MEANS
PROBABLY A CONTESTANT,

10:00.800 --> 10:02.722
SO LET'S GO OVER THERE,
TALK TO THEM,

10:02.770 --> 10:04.328
FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE OF THEM
HAS A MOTIVE.

10:04.370 --> 10:05.689
- SHAWN, YOU DON'T GET IT.

10:05.730 --> 10:06.936
THEY DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO YOU.

10:06.970 --> 10:08.198
THEY'RE FOCUSED ON MELINDA.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.764
THE MINGLE IS
A MAKE-IT-OR-BREAK-IT TIME

10:09.810 --> 10:11.107
WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE
TO GET NOTICED

10:11.140 --> 10:13.335
AND PLANT SEEDS TO GET PICKED
FOR A ONE-ON-ONE DATE.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.132
YOU GOTTA HAVE A MOMENT.

10:15.180 --> 10:17.671
- GUS, WE'RE NOT HAVING
ANY MOMENTS, OKAY?

10:17.710 --> 10:19.917
WE'RE HERE TO INVESTIGATE.
THIS ISN'T A COMPETITION.

10:19.950 --> 10:22.111
- SAYS THE GUY WHO'S GONNA
GET VOTED OUT FIRST.

10:22.150 --> 10:24.812
LISTEN, SHAWN,
I'VE STUDIED REALITY TV

10:24.850 --> 10:27.284
ALL MY LIFE FOR AN OPPORTUNITY
JUST LIKE THIS.

10:27.320 --> 10:28.412
I'M IN IT TO WIN IT.

10:28.460 --> 10:29.882
- YEAH, WELL, I'M NOT.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.784
MOSTLY BECAUSE
JULES WOULD KILL ME.

10:31.830 --> 10:33.991
I'M ACTUALLY GONNA HAVE
TO TRY TO LOSE.

10:34.030 --> 10:35.895
- HELLO.
- HI.

10:35.930 --> 10:37.898
EXCUSE ME, SHAWN,
COULD I BORROW YOU FOR A SECOND?

10:37.930 --> 10:40.137
- ACTUALLY I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF A CONVERSATION WITH MY BOY.

10:40.170 --> 10:41.728
- [laughs]

10:47.040 --> 10:49.770
- MM, DOES NOT LOOK
GOOD FOR YOU, HOMIE.

10:49.810 --> 10:50.879
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

10:50.910 --> 10:52.946
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT
AS THE ONLY BROTHER ON THE SHOW,

10:52.980 --> 10:55.710
I GET A FREE PASS
THROUGH THE FIRST ROUND.

10:55.750 --> 10:57.889
- THEN SHE DUMPS YOU
LIKE IT WAS THE END

10:59.450 --> 11:01.384
LOOK, HOMIE, I LIKE YOU.

11:01.420 --> 11:03.149
THAT'S WHY
I WANT TO HELP YOU OUT.

11:03.190 --> 11:04.680
SO JUST DROP THE FRONT.

11:04.730 --> 11:07.028
YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE SAFE BROTHER
WITH THE BORING JOB

11:07.060 --> 11:08.789
AND YOUR SHIRT TUCKED INTO
YOUR PANTS.

11:08.830 --> 11:10.297
THAT'S SO '905 HUXTABLE.

11:10.330 --> 11:12.833
IF YOU WANT THAT CHICK,
HERE'S WHAT YOU DO.

11:12.870 --> 11:14.428
YOU PLAY THE TRAGIC CARD.

11:14.470 --> 11:16.938
YOU TELL HER THAT YOUR FIANCEE
DIED IN A SKYDIVING ACCIDENT.

11:16.970 --> 11:18.369
- I'M NOT LYING.

11:18.410 --> 11:22.335
- THEN YOU'RE NOT WINNING.

11:22.380 --> 11:25.804
- I COULDN'T HELP NOTICING
THAT YOU HAVE AMAZING HAIR.

11:25.850 --> 11:27.374
- LOOKS REAL,
DOESN'T IT?

11:27.420 --> 11:29.069
IT'S NOT.
TRANSPLANT.

11:29.120 --> 11:31.816
MOSTLY FROM
MY INNER THIGHS.

11:31.850 --> 11:33.010
A LITTLE FROM
MY, UH, LOWER BACK.

11:33.060 --> 11:36.757
- [laughing]
THAT'S GOOD.

11:36.790 --> 11:37.882
- ALL RIGHT, DETECTIVE,
CAN YOU MAKE THIS QUICK?

11:37.930 --> 11:39.488
I'M TRYING
TO SAVE MY SHOW.

11:39.530 --> 11:41.498
- OH, MERCY, OF COURSE,
I'M SO SORRY.

11:41.530 --> 11:44.260
TURNS OUT YOUR CONTESTANT TODD
KRAMER'S CAR WAS TAMPERED WITH.

11:44.300 --> 11:45.767
YOU GOT ANY THOUGHTS
ON THAT?

11:45.800 --> 11:46.937
- YEAH, YEAH,
I'M CURIOUS.

11:46.970 --> 11:49.803
CAN I, UH, CAN I SUE HIM
BEFORE HE GETS OUT OF THE COMA?

11:49.840 --> 11:50.829
HE WAS MY FINALE.

11:50.870 --> 11:52.508
NOW I GOTTA DEAL
WITH THESE GUYS.

11:52.540 --> 11:54.303
- IT FEELS VERY REAL
TO ME.

11:54.340 --> 11:55.477
- THAT'S CHEATING, RIGHT?

11:55.510 --> 11:57.478
- ABSOLUTELY.

11:57.510 --> 12:00.809
- THERE'S NOTHING LIKE
THE WONDERMENT ON A CHILD'S FACE

12:00.850 --> 12:02.215
WHEN YOU READ TO HIM
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

12:02.250 --> 12:04.218
OH, THAT SMILE.

12:04.250 --> 12:06.218
- YEAH, KIDS
BUG ME.

12:06.250 --> 12:08.411
I FIND THEM
DISGUSTING.

12:08.460 --> 12:10.758
THEY HAVE STICKY FINGERS
AND THEIR VOICES ARE ALL HIGH.

12:10.790 --> 12:12.519
BUT SERIOUSLY, WHICH ONE
OF THESE DUDES

12:12.560 --> 12:14.027
DO YOU THINK
COULD BE A KILLER?

12:14.060 --> 12:17.427
- SOMETHING ABOUT THIS
SHAWN GUY WAS INTRIGUING.

12:17.470 --> 12:20.769
IT'S AS IF HE'S TRYING TO SAY
ALL THE WRONG THINGS.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.200
OF COURSE IT MAKES ME
WANT HIM MORE.

12:23.240 --> 12:26.129
I REALLY--I REALLY
LOVE A CHASE.

12:26.170 --> 12:28.070
I'M STILL TRYING TO GET A READ
ON HIS FRIEND GUS.

12:28.110 --> 12:31.807
KIND OF REMINDS ME OF BUD
FROM THE COSBY SHOW.

12:31.850 --> 12:34.444
- BEFORE PHARMACEUTICALS,
I USED TO SELL OFFICE EQUIPMENT.

12:34.480 --> 12:36.880
OOH, THE PACE.

12:36.920 --> 12:38.808
LIFE IS TOO SHORT.

12:38.850 --> 12:40.386
- MM-HM.
- SO I MADE THE SWITCH.

12:40.420 --> 12:42.411
NOW I DRIVE
AN ECHO.

12:42.460 --> 12:45.452
AND THINGS ARE GOOD.

12:48.960 --> 12:50.461
UH...

12:50.500 --> 12:52.798
MY FIANCEE DIED IN
A SKYDIVING ACCIDENT.

12:52.840 --> 12:53.795
- OH.

12:53.840 --> 12:54.898
- CAN I BORROW YOU?
- OH!

12:54.940 --> 12:56.464
ABSOLUTELY.

12:56.500 --> 13:00.869
[giggling]

13:00.910 --> 13:02.502
WITH BRODY,
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

13:02.540 --> 13:04.872
THAT TWO PEOPLE
ARE ATTRACT ED TO EACH OTHER,

13:04.910 --> 13:07.413
SO PHYSICAL APPEARANCE
IS DEFINITELY AN ATTRIBUTE

13:07.450 --> 13:08.872
THAT I LOOK FOR,

13:08.920 --> 13:10.285
BUT IT'S NOT
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.

13:10.320 --> 13:12.049
AND WITH BRODY,
THERE'S SO MUCH MORE

13:12.090 --> 13:16.049
THAN JUST
HIS HANDSOME LOOKS.

13:16.090 --> 13:19.287
LIKE...

13:19.330 --> 13:20.957
- I HATE THAT GUY.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.025
USING SUNSCREEN AS
AN EXCUSE TO PAW HER--

13:23.070 --> 13:24.389
THAT'S MY MOVE!

13:24.430 --> 13:27.968
IF I DON'T GET A HEART NECKLACE
BECAUSE OF THAT DUDE,

13:28.000 --> 13:29.365
I'M UNLEASHING
THE GUNS,

13:29.400 --> 13:32.005
FREDERICO AND PEPE--
BOOM BOOM!

13:32.040 --> 13:34.270
- OH, THE HEART.

13:34.310 --> 13:37.074
IT'S THE ONLY MUSCLE
IN THE BODY THAT CAN

13:37.110 --> 13:39.442
BE BROKEN WITH A HARSH WORD AND
REPAIRED WITH A GENTLE TOUCH.

13:39.480 --> 13:42.847
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

13:42.890 --> 13:43.584
- DUDES LIKE THIS,
THEY NEVER WIN.

13:43.620 --> 13:45.178
- [sighs]
HEY.

13:45.220 --> 13:47.609
- I'M SORRY, GUY,
I'VE JUST SEEN A LOT OF THESE.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.480
- YEAH, WE KEEP HIM AROUND
BECAUSE HE'S GOOD AT GRILLING.

13:49.520 --> 13:50.987
- [giggIeSJ

13:51.030 --> 13:52.486
- I THINK I MIGHT
LOVE HER.

13:52.530 --> 13:54.896
OR SOMETHING.

13:54.930 --> 13:57.398
IF I FIND OUT THAT
ANY ONE OF YOU PUDS

13:57.430 --> 14:02.333
AREN'T HERE FOR
THE RIGHT REASONS...

14:02.370 --> 14:04.008
YOU'RE DEAD MEAT.

14:04.040 --> 14:08.477
- WHY ARE YOU
LOOKING AT ME?

14:08.510 --> 14:11.877
- I GOTTA PEE.

14:11.910 --> 14:13.616
- DID YOU SEE THAT?

14:13.650 --> 14:15.572
DUDE WAS LOOKING
RIGHT AT ME.

14:15.620 --> 14:18.043
CAN YOU SAY
SUSPECTO NUMERO UNO?

14:18.090 --> 14:19.580
- SUSPECT O--

14:19.620 --> 14:22.612
- DON'T DO IT, IT SOUNDED
WAY BETTER IN MY HEAD.

14:25.660 --> 14:29.528
HEY, COME ON.

14:29.560 --> 14:33.337
NOW, REMEMBER, ALL OF
OUR MOVES ARE BEING FILMED,

14:33.370 --> 14:36.635
SO LET'S COVER FOR EACH OTHER
WHILE WE SNOOP.

14:36.670 --> 14:40.879
- DON'T WORRY, SHAWN,
THE JACKAL IS HERE.

14:45.010 --> 14:46.102
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?

14:46.150 --> 14:47.970
- MARIO'S STUFF.
HE'S TOTALLY A HOTHEAD.

14:48.020 --> 14:49.647
MAYBE TODD WAS GETTING
TOO CLOSE TO MELINDA,

14:49.680 --> 14:51.511
OR WASN'T HERE
"FOR THE RIGHT REASONS"

14:51.550 --> 14:54.678
AND HAD TO BE STOPPED.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.517
GIANT ROLL,
ON THREE.

14:56.560 --> 14:59.654
ONE, TWO--

14:59.690 --> 15:00.952
- JACKAL DOWN,
JACKAL DOWN!

15:01.000 --> 15:02.058
- ARE YOU OKAY,
JACKAL?

15:02.100 --> 15:03.965
- I'M COOL.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.333
I'M COOL.

15:07.370 --> 15:10.464
DUDE, THIS IS
BRODY'S STUFF?

15:10.510 --> 15:11.659
ALL HE BROUGHT WAS
FLAX BARS AND A SPEEDO.

15:11.710 --> 15:12.699
- WHAT?

15:12.740 --> 15:14.071
THE GUY'S HERE
FOR THREE WEEKS

15:14.110 --> 15:15.134
AND DIDN'T PACK
A SINGLE SHIRT?

15:15.180 --> 15:16.306
- NOPE.

15:16.340 --> 15:19.343
- WOW.

15:25.320 --> 15:27.117
- DUDE.

15:27.160 --> 15:30.527
WHAT WOULD SOMEONE NEED A PAIR
OF GREASY GLOVES FOR

15:30.560 --> 15:32.425
ON A DATING SHOW?

15:32.460 --> 15:35.691
- I BET THESE
COME IN HANDY

15:35.730 --> 15:38.722
WHEN YOU NEED TO CUT
SOMEBODY'S BRAKE LINES.

15:38.770 --> 15:42.035
JUST AS
I THOUGHT--

15:42.070 --> 15:43.162
SALAD DRESSING.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.166
- BRAKE FLUID.

15:45.210 --> 15:48.976
- LOOKS LIKE MARIO'S WILLING
TO STAND BEHIND HIS THREATS.

15:49.010 --> 15:50.705
- THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM
WITH THAT THEORY, SHAWN.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.502
IT'S NOT MARIO'S.

15:52.550 --> 15:54.211
- WHOSE IS IT?

15:54.250 --> 15:57.640
- IT'S DAN NY'S.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.079
- SO WHAT EXACTLY ARE
YOU GUYS LOOKING FOR?

16:05.130 --> 16:07.098
- PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE
OF DANNY PUTTING THE GLOVES

16:07.130 --> 16:09.496
INSIDE HIS CUBBYHOLE.

16:09.530 --> 16:10.519
NOTHING.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.424
IT'S LIKE IT
NEVER HAPPENED.

16:12.470 --> 16:14.631
- UNLESS DANNY CAN
MAKE HIMSELF INVISIBLE.

16:14.670 --> 16:16.035
HEY, DO WE HAVE ANY FOOTAGE
WHERE IT LOOKS LIKE

16:16.070 --> 16:18.038
JUST A PAIR OF GLASSES
WALKING INTO THE ROOM?

16:18.070 --> 16:19.207
[cell phone buzzes]

16:19.240 --> 16:23.574
- NO.

16:23.610 --> 16:24.770
- HUH.
EXCUSE ME.

16:24.810 --> 16:27.711
THIS IS A REAL CALL
FROM ACTUAL REALITY.

16:27.750 --> 16:28.739
HEY, JULES.

16:28.780 --> 16:29.940
WE FOLLOWED UP
ON THE GLOVES,

16:29.980 --> 16:32.448
BUT COULDN'T GET ANY DEFINITIVE
EVIDENCE FROM THE FOOTAGE.

16:32.490 --> 16:33.787
I THINK YOU AND LASSIE
SHOULD PROBABLY

16:33.820 --> 16:35.253
CHECK IT OUT FOR YOURSELVES.

16:35.290 --> 16:36.552
- GOOD IDEA, SHAWN.

16:39.460 --> 16:41.098
- ALL RIGHT.
GOTTA GO.

16:41.130 --> 16:43.018
GOT A CATAMARAN CRUISE
IN TEN MINUTES

16:43.070 --> 16:44.264
AND I DON'T HAVE
PROPER DECK SHOES.

16:44.300 --> 16:48.031
- OH, I AM SO, SO SORRY
THAT OUR INVESTIGATION

16:48.070 --> 16:49.469
IS INTERFERING WITH
YOUR DATING LIFE, SHAWN.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.036
- JULES, COME ON.

16:51.070 --> 16:52.367
YOU THINK I REALLY
WANNA BE OUT ON A BOAT,

16:52.410 --> 16:53.729
SIPPING CHAMPAGNE
AND FEEDING GRAPES

16:53.780 --> 16:55.634
TO SOME BIKINI-CLAD
PHILANTH ROPIST?

16:55.680 --> 16:58.774
- NO, LOOK, I'LL ADMIT,
I WAS ANGRY AT FIRST,

16:58.810 --> 17:00.277
AND MAYBE
A LITTLE BIT JEALOUS,

17:00.320 --> 17:01.810
BUT I'M NOT ANYMORE.

17:01.850 --> 17:03.386
- LOOK, I'LL BE HONEST.

17:03.420 --> 17:05.115
I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN
TO FEND MELINDA OFF.

17:05.150 --> 17:07.186
BUT IN THE END,
I THINK MY CHARMS

17:07.220 --> 17:08.653
MAY PROVE TOO MUCH
FOR HER TO RESIST.

17:08.690 --> 17:10.226
- YOU KISS HER, YOU DIE.

17:10.260 --> 17:11.625
- DULY NOTED.

17:11.660 --> 17:14.197
- YOU NEVER REALLY LIKED
TODD KRAMER, DID YOU, DANNY?

17:14.230 --> 17:15.788
- WAIT, I'M SORRY,
DETECTIVE.

17:15.830 --> 17:17.422
WHAT IS HAPPENING
IN THIS SCENE?

17:17.470 --> 17:18.619
- THIS ISN'T A SCENE, SON.

17:18.670 --> 17:19.625
YOU'RE IN
SERIOUS TROUBLE.

17:19.670 --> 17:21.592
- BUT TV TROUBLE,
THOUGH, RIGHT?

17:21.640 --> 17:24.461
I MEAN, IT'S...
[laughs]

17:24.510 --> 17:26.159
- A MAN IS IN A COMA.

17:26.210 --> 17:28.132
AND WE WANT SOME ANSWERS,
SO YOU BETTER START TALKING.

17:28.180 --> 17:30.102
- WHY WAS THERE A PAIR
OF MECHANIC'S GLOVES

17:30.150 --> 17:31.208
IN YOUR STUFF, DANNY?

17:31.250 --> 17:32.740
- WAIT, HOLD ON.
DO YOU THINK

17:32.780 --> 17:34.372
THAT I HAD SOMETHING TO DO
WITH HIS ACCIDENT?

17:34.420 --> 17:36.547
- WELL, OF ALL OF
THE CONTESTANTS ON THE SHOW,

17:36.580 --> 17:39.117
YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE
THAT CONTACTED THEM.

17:39.150 --> 17:41.812
- YEAH, I MEAN,
I SAW THE AD AND I--

17:41.860 --> 17:42.815
WE WENT TO
THE SAME COLLEGE.

17:42.860 --> 17:45.181
I THOUGHT MAYBE
IT'D BE FUN TO SEE HER AGAIN.

17:45.230 --> 17:46.652
- OH, RIGHT, RIGHT,
IT DOES SAY THAT

17:46.690 --> 17:48.851
THEY TOOK A CREATIVE WRITING
CLASS TOGETHER.

17:48.900 --> 17:51.164
- YEAH, ABOUT THAT.
YOU WERE A PHYSICS MAJOR.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.691
SO WHAT WERE YOU DOING TAKING
A CREATIVE WRITING CLASS?

17:53.740 --> 17:57.801
- HEY, I'M SORRY, IS TAKING A
CLASS OUTSIDE MY MAJOR A CRIME?

17:57.840 --> 17:59.398
- NO, BUT STALKING IS.

17:59.440 --> 18:00.532
COME ON.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.638
YOU'RE OBSESSED
WITH MELINDA.

18:01.680 --> 18:04.547
YOU CAN'T STAND THE IDEA
OF ANOTHER MAN HAVING HER.

18:04.580 --> 18:07.276
- OKAY, LISTEN.
AM I UNDER ARREST?

18:07.320 --> 18:10.380
- NOT YET, BUT WE'LL BE
SEEING YA AGAIN, DANNY.

18:10.420 --> 18:13.116
- ONLY ON TV.

18:16.460 --> 18:17.620
DR. WOMACK,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:17.660 --> 18:19.582
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
AT THE MANSION?

18:19.630 --> 18:23.521
- I WAS AND--
AND I GOT A CALL.

18:23.570 --> 18:26.391
- OH, MAN, THEY'RE GONNA GRILL
YOU ABOUT TODD'S ACCIDENT, TOO.

18:26.430 --> 18:27.795
THEY JUST ACCUSED ME OF BEING
A CREEPY STALKER-TYPE.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.432
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?

18:29.470 --> 18:32.633
- THAT IS RIDICULOUS. EVERYONE
KNOWS THAT YOU'RE THE--THE--

18:32.670 --> 18:33.898
- FUN GUY.

18:33.940 --> 18:35.498
- THE FUN GUY.
THE GRILL MAN.

18:35.540 --> 18:36.837
DANNY THE FUN GRILL MAN.

18:36.880 --> 18:37.847
- 'COURSE I'M A GRILL MAN.

18:37.880 --> 18:39.177
STAY STRONG, DOCTOR.

18:39.210 --> 18:40.177
- YEAH, YOU TOO, DANNY.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.279
- ALL RIGHT, PEACE.

18:45.650 --> 18:46.639
- SPENCER, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:46.690 --> 18:47.782
DO YOU WANNA
BLOW YOUR COVER?

18:47.820 --> 18:50.618
- I SWUNG BY EARLY, SO I CAN
GET BACK BY FOUR O'CLOCK

18:50.660 --> 18:52.480
FOR THE ICE CREAM BAR
AT THE MANSION.

18:52.530 --> 18:53.690
- YOUR GUY IS DEFINITELY
LYING ABOUT SOMETHING.

18:53.730 --> 18:54.822
BUT WE JUST
COULDN'T NAIL HIM DOWN.

18:54.860 --> 18:56.327
- HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS.

18:56.360 --> 18:58.328
EVEN THOUGH HE CONSIDERS ME
DIRECT COMPETITION,

18:58.370 --> 18:59.462
DANNY LIKES ME.

18:59.500 --> 19:00.489
WHICH MEANS
I CAN WORK HIM.

19:00.540 --> 19:01.666
I CAN GET A CONFESSION.

19:01.700 --> 19:02.837
- OH, THAT'S GREAT, SHAWN.

19:02.870 --> 19:04.201
BUT YOU DON'T
CONTROL THE SHOW.

19:04.240 --> 19:05.764
HOW ARE YOU
GONNA KEEP DANNY ON IT?

19:05.810 --> 19:07.801
- HMM.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.648
- DO YOU ACCEPT MY HEART

19:13.680 --> 19:14.908
AND PROMISE
TO PROTECT IT?

19:14.950 --> 19:16.474
- UH, YEAH,
I SUPPOSE SO.

19:16.520 --> 19:17.646
FIGURATIVELY.

19:17.690 --> 19:18.816
LITERALLY WOULD BE
KIND OF WEIRD,

19:18.850 --> 19:20.579
DON'T YOU THINK?

19:20.620 --> 19:22.178
JUST HOLDING IT?
BLOODY AND VALVE-Y?

19:22.220 --> 19:24.950
[chuckles]
YEAH, I'LL DO IT.

19:24.990 --> 19:28.255
IT'S ALL RIGHT, MAN.
YOU TRIED.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.949
- GUS...

19:30.000 --> 19:31.558
- HMM, LOOK AT THAT.

19:31.600 --> 19:32.726
YOU GET ONE, TOO.

19:32.770 --> 19:34.294
- THANK YOU.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.659
I LOOK FORWARD
TO THE OPPORTUNITY

19:35.700 --> 19:36.667
TO GET
TO KNOW YOU BETTER.

19:36.700 --> 19:38.804
- SO SWEET.

19:38.840 --> 19:39.636
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

19:39.670 --> 19:42.730
- I SAW IT.
I KNEW IT WAS COMING.

19:42.780 --> 19:44.600
I WAS GETTING
MY HEART ON.

19:44.650 --> 19:47.539
- I JUST GAVE HIM A HEART
'CAUSE I FELT BAD FOR HIM.

19:47.580 --> 19:50.583
I MEAN, HE LOST HIS FIANCEE
IN A PARACHUTE ACCIDENT.

19:58.930 --> 20:00.488
- BIG CHOICE.

20:00.530 --> 20:02.327
- THE WEEK AFTER
WE GET MARRIED,

20:02.360 --> 20:06.968
HOPEFULLY WE JUST MAKE
A TON OF KIDS.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.764
- UH, EXCUSE ME,
SORRY, SORRY.

20:09.800 --> 20:12.007
I JUST--I-I NEED
TO SAY SOMETHING TO THE GROUP.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.507
- WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON NOW?

20:13.540 --> 20:15.428
- MELINDA, IF I MAY,
I KNOW THE DECISION IS YOURS

20:15.480 --> 20:17.402
WHO YOU WANNA GIVE THE HEART TO,
BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW

20:17.450 --> 20:19.509
THERE IS SOMEONE
HERE AMONGST US

20:19.550 --> 20:20.869
WHO DOES NOT HAVE YOUR BEST
INTERESTS IN THEIR HEART.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.740
- BROTHER'S GONE ROGUE.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

20:22.780 --> 20:24.008
- SEAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:24.050 --> 20:28.487
- WELL, UH, THIS PERSON DID NOT
COME HERE WITH A CLEAN HEART.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.522
THEY HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

20:30.560 --> 20:33.358
THIS PERSON...
IS MARIO.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.891
- OH, SWEET JESUS.

20:35.930 --> 20:37.329
- DO WE STOP TAPING?
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

20:37.370 --> 20:39.588
NO, NO, NO, WE GO IN
FOR CLOSE-UPS. HANK!

20:39.630 --> 20:44.738
- DUDE, WHAT THE HELL?

20:44.770 --> 20:45.907
- BROWN CURLY HAIR!

20:45.940 --> 20:46.907
SHE HAS
BROWN CURLY HAIR.

20:46.940 --> 20:47.929
SHE LIKES
TO RIDE HOGS.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.709
- SHE RIDES PIGS?

20:49.740 --> 20:52.470
- YOU TWO GUYS ARE GONNA GET
YOUR ASSES PUMMELED.

20:52.510 --> 20:53.875
- "YOU GUYS"? WHAT'S WITH
THE "YOU GUYS" PART?

20:53.920 --> 20:55.740
WHY IS HE SAYING
"YOU GUYS"?

20:55.780 --> 20:57.042
- NOT EVEN THAT
ATTRACTIVE, REALLY.

20:57.080 --> 20:58.911
MUSTACHE ISSUES.
WHAT'S HER NAME, MARIO?

20:58.950 --> 21:01.919
- BROS BEFORE HOS!

21:01.960 --> 21:03.780
- OOH, FOLKS,
WE HAVE GOT A FIGHT.

21:03.830 --> 21:04.785
- [roars]

21:04.830 --> 21:06.855
- N-N-N-NO, LOOK--

21:06.890 --> 21:08.494
- [growls]

21:08.530 --> 21:09.895
- THINK ABOUT IT!
DON'T DO IT.

21:09.930 --> 21:10.760
THINK ABOUT IT.

21:10.800 --> 21:13.792
[grunting]

21:13.840 --> 21:17.037
[groans]

21:17.070 --> 21:18.628
- NOW MELINDA,

21:18.670 --> 21:20.774
DESPITE THE UNORTHODOX EVENTS
THAT HAVE JUST HAPPENED,

21:20.810 --> 21:23.745
YOU STILL HAVE TO DECIDE
WHO GETS YOUR FINAL HEART.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.476
- I-I-I GUESS I CH-CHOOSE...

21:29.520 --> 21:33.388
ONCE YOU SEE SOMEONE HAVE
A COMPLETE MENTAL BREAKDOWN,

21:33.420 --> 21:36.014
IT'S PROBABLY A SIGN THAT
HE'S NOT A GOOD MATCH FOR YOU.

21:36.060 --> 21:38.949
BUT. . .REALLY
IT JUST MADE ME THINK

21:38.990 --> 21:41.925
THAT MARIO'S
SUPER-PASSIONATE.

21:41.960 --> 21:43.496
BUT I KINDA HEARD
MY MOM'S VOICE IN MY HEAD.

21:43.530 --> 21:45.566
BUT HE'S SO MAD--
- SO THEN DANNY.

21:45.600 --> 21:47.898
CONGRATULATIONS, DAN NY!

21:47.940 --> 21:51.933
- [screaming]

21:53.780 --> 21:55.532
- THESE GUYS ARE
REALITY TV GOLD!

21:55.580 --> 21:56.729
- I KNOW, I KNOW!

21:59.780 --> 22:01.577
- SO NOW THAT
YOU'VE MADE A MOCKERY

22:01.620 --> 22:03.781
OF A LEGITIMATE DATING PROCESS
TO KEEP THIS KID ON THE SHOW,

22:03.820 --> 22:04.741
WHAT'S OUR NEXT MOVE?

22:04.790 --> 22:05.882
- "LEGITIMATE DATING PROCESS"?

22:05.920 --> 22:07.649
- YES, SHAWN,
LEGITIMATE.

22:07.690 --> 22:09.817
- WE WALK OVER THERE AND
WE MAKE CASUAL CONVERSATION.

22:09.860 --> 22:11.953
WE GET HIM TO REVEAL
HIS MOTIVE FOR KILLING TODD.

22:11.990 --> 22:13.355
- SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.719
BUT JUST GIVE IT A BEAT.

22:14.760 --> 22:17.467
LET'S LET HIM GET THE PATTIES
ON THE GRILL FIRST.

22:17.500 --> 22:18.262
THERE'S NO REASON
WE CAN'T EAT

22:18.300 --> 22:20.530
AND INVESTIGATE
AT THE SAME TIME.

22:20.570 --> 22:22.561
- THAT'S TRUE, ACTUALLY.

22:28.710 --> 22:30.701
- DUDE, THE PATTIES AREN'T
ON THE GRILL YET.

22:48.530 --> 22:49.952
- EASY, TIGER.

22:50.000 --> 22:50.967
- OH, MY GOD,
HE'S BLEEDING.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.627
- OH, HE SURE IS.
UH...

22:52.670 --> 22:53.637
IS THERE A DOCTOR
IN THE HOUSE?

22:53.670 --> 22:54.659
WE NEED A DOCTOR HERE!

22:54.700 --> 22:55.928
- UH, YOU'RE A DOCTOR.

22:55.970 --> 22:57.665
- THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
I AM A DOCTOR.

22:57.710 --> 23:00.065
BUT I SPECIALIZE IN PULMONARY
AND SOMETIMES BRAIN.

23:00.110 --> 23:02.476
NOSE ISN'T REALLY
MY FORTE.

23:02.510 --> 23:03.602
- WOW, SERIOUSLY?
YOU HAVE PROBLEMS.

23:03.650 --> 23:04.742
- UH, YEAH.

23:04.780 --> 23:06.008
WE'LL USE THIS.

23:06.050 --> 23:08.439
ALL RIGHT,
HERE WE GO.

23:08.480 --> 23:12.519
SEE? YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

23:12.550 --> 23:16.418
- DEB, I WANNA
SEE GIANUKOS NOW.

23:16.460 --> 23:19.088
WHAT THE--

23:19.130 --> 23:21.018
UH...HEY!

23:21.060 --> 23:22.493
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

23:22.530 --> 23:24.669
- I WANT A CRACK
AT THAT STALKER NERD.

23:24.700 --> 23:25.792
THAT MAN'S HIDING SOMETHING.
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED HERE?

23:25.830 --> 23:27.024
- OKAY, LISTEN TO ME.

23:27.070 --> 23:29.789
YOUR STALKER NERD ALMOST GOT
TOASTED A FEW MINUTES AGO, OKAY?

23:29.840 --> 23:31.808
HE WAS THE VICTIM.

23:31.840 --> 23:33.137
EVERYONE KNOWS
HE DOES THE GRILLING.

23:33.170 --> 23:34.808
SO UNLESS HE WAS TRYING
TO KILL HIMSELF,

23:34.840 --> 23:35.829
HE'S NOT OUR SUSPECT.

23:35.880 --> 23:37.029
NOW GET OUT OF HERE.

23:37.080 --> 23:38.479
- A VERY GOOD-LOOKING MAN
IS IN A COMA,

23:38.510 --> 23:40.546
AND SOMEBODY CAUSED IT.

23:40.580 --> 23:42.445
I'M PUTTING AN END
TO THIS CIRCUS NOW.

23:42.480 --> 23:43.742
LISTEN UP,
15-MINUTERS.

23:43.790 --> 23:46.714
TODD KRAMER'S CRASH
WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT.

23:46.750 --> 23:48.854
SOMEONE IS TRYING TO KILL
THE CONTESTANTS

23:48.890 --> 23:51.859
OF THIS PATHETIC REPLACEMENT
FOR HUMAN INTERACTION.

23:51.890 --> 23:54.552
SIDE NOTE--TRUE LOVE
IS NOT FOUND ON TV.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.192
- THIS PASTY DETECTIVE
IS RIGHT.

23:56.230 --> 23:58.619
IT'S FOUND IN A WOMEN'S
PRISON FACILITY.

23:58.670 --> 24:01.468
- WAIT A MINUTE.
SOMEONE'S TRYING TO KILL ME?

24:01.500 --> 24:03.639
[hyperventilating]

24:03.670 --> 24:04.807
- BRODY, JUST
BREATHE, MAN.

24:04.840 --> 24:07.536
- YEAH, AND PUT
A SHIRT ON.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.612
- I'M SORRY. I'M--I AM,
REALLY, I'M SORRY.

24:13.650 --> 24:15.868
I JUST--I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU GUYS ARE DOING HERE.

24:15.920 --> 24:17.945
- SOMEONE WAS ALMOST
BARBECUED ON YOUR GRILL.

24:17.990 --> 24:18.911
- THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

24:18.950 --> 24:20.110
I WILL CALL THE GAS COMPANY
IN THE MORNING.

24:20.150 --> 24:23.119
BUT RIGHT NOW, I BELIEVE TWO
PEOPLE ARE BREAKING THE LAW.

24:23.160 --> 24:24.559
OH, THAT'S RIGHT,
YOU GUYS.

24:24.590 --> 24:26.683
TRESPASSING.
HANK, STOP SHOOTING.

24:26.730 --> 24:29.119
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
YOU IDIOT?

24:29.160 --> 24:30.149
YOU STILL HERE?

24:30.200 --> 24:34.261
- HEY, GUYS.

24:34.300 --> 24:36.564
LISTEN, I HAD A VISION.

24:36.600 --> 24:37.806
IT WAS JAY AND MELINDA.

24:37.840 --> 24:39.535
SORDID. IT WAS FILTHY.

24:39.570 --> 24:40.537
JULES, COVER YOUR EARS.

24:40.580 --> 24:41.729
- SHAWN.

24:41.780 --> 24:43.577
- HE HIRES A BEAUTIFUL GIRL
FOR THE SHOW.

24:43.610 --> 24:44.702
THEN HE FALLS
IN LOVE WITH HER.

24:44.750 --> 24:47.048
AND NOW HE'S JEALOUS
OF ALL THE GUYS

24:47.080 --> 24:48.809
THAT ARE COMPETING
FOR HER AFFECTIONS.

24:48.850 --> 24:50.647
ESPECIALLY THE ONES THAT SHE
ACTUALLY LIKES, LIKE TODD.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.510
AND ME.

24:52.550 --> 24:54.154
- I DON'T THINK YOU FIT
INTO THAT CATEGORY, SHAWN.

24:54.190 --> 24:56.181
- OH, JULES, THAT'S CUTE.
[banging sound]

24:56.220 --> 24:58.222
HEY, BRODY,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

24:58.260 --> 24:59.659
- I'M QUITTING.

24:59.690 --> 25:00.793
LOOK, MELINDA'S
A NICE GIRL

25:00.830 --> 25:02.127
AND SHE LOOKS
GREAT NAKED.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.890
BUT SHE'S NOT
WORTH DYING OVER.

25:04.930 --> 25:06.795
THERE'S EASIER WAYS
TO GET EXPOSURE.

25:06.830 --> 25:08.229
- WHEN DID
HE SEE HER NAKED?

25:08.270 --> 25:09.692
HEY, YOUR BACK
IS GONNA STICK

25:09.740 --> 25:12.561
TO THE LEATHER SEATS
OF THAT LUXURY SEDAN!

25:12.610 --> 25:14.271
- POOR MELINDA.

25:14.310 --> 25:16.801
WHO DOES SHE POSSIBLY HAVE
TO CHOOSE FROM NOW?

25:16.840 --> 25:18.273
- HELLO?

25:18.310 --> 25:22.542
I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE.
- I KNOW.

25:22.580 --> 25:25.583
- WATCH YOUR TOES.

25:31.590 --> 25:33.694
- SERIOUSLY? YOU'RE GONNA PUT
ALL THAT OIL IN YOUR HEAD?

25:33.730 --> 25:34.719
- YOU KNOW
THAT'S RIGHT.

25:34.760 --> 25:36.159
LAVENDER.

25:36.200 --> 25:37.326
MELINDA LIKES
A MINTY SHINE.

25:37.360 --> 25:38.190
- WOULD YOU FOCUS?

25:38.230 --> 25:39.219
WE NEED TO USE THIS DAY
TO FIGURE OUT

25:39.270 --> 25:41.636
THE REAL RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN MELINDA AND JAY.

25:41.670 --> 25:43.194
- RIGHT, ALL I GOTTA DO
IS GET HER TO ADMIT

25:43.240 --> 25:44.662
THAT SHE'S SECRETLY
DATING HIM.

25:44.710 --> 25:45.859
- YEAH, AND I'LL DO
MOST OF THE TALKING.

25:45.910 --> 25:47.332
SINCE OBVIOUSLY
SHE'S WAY MORE INTO ME.

25:47.370 --> 25:50.009
- MAN, PLEASE, HER HEART
IS BLEEDING FOR ME, SHAWN.

25:50.040 --> 25:52.201
MY LADY'S 'CHUTE
DIDN'T OPEN.

25:52.250 --> 25:54.309
- SHE ISN'T EVEN SURE
WHAT YOUR NAME IS.

25:55.680 --> 25:58.342
- SHH. REAL LIFE,
NOT TV.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.756
HELLO, MELINDA.

26:00.790 --> 26:02.257
- HI. OH, THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU FOR THAT.

26:02.290 --> 26:04.121
SOMETHING'S
WEIGHING ON YOU.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.957
- WOW.

26:05.990 --> 26:09.118
YOU ARE SO INTUITIVE,
SHAWN.

26:09.160 --> 26:12.027
YEAH, I GUESS THE PRESSURE OF
PICKING THE RIGHT BACHELOR

26:12.070 --> 26:14.231
IS JUST CAUSING ME
A LOT OF STRESS.

26:14.270 --> 26:15.794
- BELIEVE ME,
I GET IT.

26:15.840 --> 26:19.264
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT
THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE?

26:19.310 --> 26:20.834
SOMEONE YOU'RE INVOLVED WITH
IN THE NIGHTTIME?

26:20.880 --> 26:21.938
- SHAWN.

26:21.980 --> 26:23.845
MAY I CUT IN HERE?

26:23.880 --> 26:26.303
- THIS IS A TACO-BURRITO
CONVERSATION, NACHOS.

26:26.350 --> 26:27.305
- EXCUSE ME, SHAWN.

26:27.350 --> 26:30.376
- OH, THIS IS SO DUMB.

26:30.420 --> 26:32.945
- MAY I PROPOSE A TOAST?
- PLEASE.

26:32.990 --> 26:34.787
- TO ALL
THE POSSIBILITIES

26:34.820 --> 26:37.380
OF THINGS WE CAN GET INTO
WITHOUT SHAWN...

26:37.420 --> 26:38.227
OR ANYBODY ELSE.

26:38.260 --> 26:39.329
[glasses clink]

26:39.360 --> 26:41.123
THERE ISN'T
ANYONE ELSE, IS THERE?

26:41.160 --> 26:44.220
MAYBE SOMEONE...ROTUND?

26:44.270 --> 26:46.226
- I-I DON'T...

26:48.400 --> 26:49.230
- GOODNIGHT, BUDDY,
I'M CUTTING IN.

26:49.270 --> 26:55.175
- I JUST GOT HERE.
- GET OUTTA HERE.

26:55.210 --> 26:57.371
- LET ME ADD TO THAT TOAST
WITH THE FOLLOWING QUESTION.

26:57.410 --> 26:58.946
HOW MANY GUYS
HAVE YOU SLEPT WITH

26:58.980 --> 27:00.208
SINCE WE STARTED
SHOOTING THIS SHOW?

27:00.250 --> 27:02.241
- [gaSPSJ

27:02.280 --> 27:03.417
- HE'S AN IDIOT.
I'M CUTTING BACK IN.

27:03.450 --> 27:05.008
- YOU CAN'T CUT IN
TO A CUT IN.

27:05.050 --> 27:06.688
- YOU CUT INTO MY CUT IN,
WE'RE ALREADY MID-CUT IN.

27:06.720 --> 27:07.948
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
RIGHT NOW.

27:07.990 --> 27:08.957
- WELL, THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.

27:08.990 --> 27:11.823
- WILL YOU GIVE US
A MOMENT PLEASE, MELINDA?

27:11.860 --> 27:15.250
- EXCUSE ME.

27:15.300 --> 27:16.949
- YOU'RE DOING IT
ALL STUPID.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.365
- OH, MAN, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT STUPID IS.

27:18.400 --> 27:19.628
YOU DON'T ASK SOMEBODY
HOW MANY DUDES SHE SLEPT WITH.

27:19.670 --> 27:21.331
- IT'S A PERFECT LY LEGITIMATE
QUESTION WHEN YOU'RE ON A DATE.

27:21.370 --> 27:22.439
- NO, THAT WAS NOT, SHAWN,
NO, IT WAS NOT.

27:22.470 --> 27:23.698
YOU NEED TO GO BACK
AND READ THE PLAYER HANDBOOK.

27:23.740 --> 27:26.004
- YOU'RE LIKE RYAN GOSLING WHEN
HE'S SINGING WITH THE UKULELE

27:26.040 --> 27:27.200
IN BLUE VALENTINE,
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE.

27:27.240 --> 27:27.808
- NO, NO, NO, NO, DO NOT USE
AN OBSCURE REFERENCE ON ME,

27:27.840 --> 27:30.001
I GET THAT, I GET THAT.

27:30.040 --> 27:31.268
- FINE, FINE. I'M RIGHT HERE,
I AIN'T GOING BACK OUT THERE.

27:31.310 --> 27:32.242
- I AIN'T GOIN' BACK
OUT THERE EITHER.

27:32.280 --> 27:35.909
- FINE.
- FINE.

27:35.950 --> 27:38.111
- ARE YOU
KIDDING ME?

27:38.150 --> 27:41.358
ALL RIGHT, LET'S JUST--LET'S
RESET FOR THE FONDUE SEGMENT.

27:41.390 --> 27:42.812
- FONDUE, I HEAR THAT.

27:42.860 --> 27:44.680
- WHAT THE HELL IS
GOING ON WITH YOU GUYS?

27:44.730 --> 27:47.381
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE MORE INTO EACH
OTHER THAN YOU ARE INTO ME.

27:47.430 --> 27:49.990
- YEAH, LOOK, THAT'S--THAT'S
FAIR, AND--AND I APOLOGIZE

27:50.030 --> 27:51.292
FOR GUS' BEHAVIOR.
- MY BEHAVIOR?

27:51.330 --> 27:53.935
- IT'S JUVENILE AND
IT'S NOT VERY LIKABLE.

27:53.970 --> 27:55.232
- IS IT?
- IT'S HIGHLY UNLIKABLE.

27:55.270 --> 27:57.261
- WOW.
- BUT ANSWER US THIS.

27:57.300 --> 27:58.767
WHY HAVE YOU
BEEN SLEEPING WITH JAY?

27:58.810 --> 27:59.936
- WHAT?

27:59.970 --> 28:01.278
I'M NOT SLEEPING
WITH JAY.

28:01.310 --> 28:03.107
- WE SAW YOU KISS HIM
BEHIND THE POOL.

28:03.140 --> 28:05.301
- NO, NO.

28:05.350 --> 28:09.468
JAY WAS JUST SHOWING ME HOW
TO "SELL THE ROMANCE" ON CAMERA,

28:09.520 --> 28:11.147
AS HE CALLS IT.

28:11.190 --> 28:12.418
IT WAS JUST A REHEARSAL.

28:12.450 --> 28:14.452
I FELT REALLY SILLY
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.

28:14.490 --> 28:16.287
BUT I DIDN'T
ACTUALLY KISS HIM.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.356
WAIT, WERE YOU
SPYING ON ME?

28:18.390 --> 28:19.926
- GUS WAS.
- WHAT?

28:19.960 --> 28:21.097
- I WAS BUSY SAVING
DANNY'S LIFE.

28:21.130 --> 28:22.154
- I WILL PUNCH YOU
IN THE FACE, SHAWN.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.258
- IT'S TRUE.

28:23.300 --> 28:25.222
- WAIT, WHAT--
YOU SAVED DANNY'S LIFE?

28:25.270 --> 28:27.488
- I DID WHAT ANYBODY ELSE
WOULD HAVE DONE.

28:27.530 --> 28:29.236
- OKAY, GUYS, UM...

28:29.270 --> 28:30.259
GUYS, THAT WAS, UM,

28:30.300 --> 28:31.506
THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.

28:31.540 --> 28:33.508
REALLY, REALLY
GOOD ENERGY.

28:33.540 --> 28:35.201
AND, UM, MAYBE JUST--
JUST NOT SO MUCH PUSHING.

28:35.240 --> 28:36.730
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.
- GOT IT.

28:36.780 --> 28:38.270
- GUS IS PREPARED TO PAY
FOR ALL THE PROFITEROLES.

28:38.310 --> 28:40.346
- YOU MUST BE
OUT OF YOUR DAMN MIND.

28:40.380 --> 28:41.847
- NO, LOOK, GUYS,
GUYS, NOT NECESSARY.

28:41.880 --> 28:45.384
JAY'S GOT THIS--THIS SHOW
INSURED TO THE ROOF.

28:45.420 --> 28:46.978
I MEAN, LITERALLY,
YOU COULD BREAK THE ROOF.

28:47.020 --> 28:49.011
AND JAY'D GET A NEW ROOF.

28:49.060 --> 28:51.824
- HUH.

28:51.860 --> 28:53.179
- OKAY, LOOK,
DID I HIT ON MELINDA?

28:53.230 --> 28:54.299
YES.

28:54.330 --> 28:56.093
GUILTY, HUH?
TAKE ME AWAY.

28:56.130 --> 28:58.064
BUT IF YOU
ACTUALLY THINK THAT

28:58.100 --> 29:00.466
I'M KILLING OFF
MY OWN CONTESTANTS ONE AT A TIME

29:00.500 --> 29:01.489
SO THAT I CAN HAVE
HER TO MYSELF--

29:01.540 --> 29:04.065
I MEAN, THAT'S--THAT'S CRAZY.

29:04.110 --> 29:07.102
- IT DOES SOUND
A LITTLE CRAZY.

29:07.140 --> 29:08.175
- YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

29:08.210 --> 29:09.279
- THANK YOU.

29:09.310 --> 29:12.006
[phone buzzes]

29:16.380 --> 29:17.347
- ONE MORE QUESTION.

29:17.380 --> 29:18.881
- YEAH?

29:18.920 --> 29:20.012
- DO YOU HAVE AN INSURANCE
POLICY ON THE SHOW?

29:20.050 --> 29:23.986
- UH, YES, I DO.

29:24.030 --> 29:25.224
I'M A BUSINESSMAN.

29:25.260 --> 29:28.320
- AND THAT MEANS ALL OF YOUR
CONTESTANTS ARE INSURED AS WELL.

29:28.360 --> 29:30.123
- I SUPPOSE THEY ARE.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.559
- CORRECT ME IF
I'M WRONG HERE.

29:31.600 --> 29:33.522
BUT THIS IS ALL YOUR OWN MONEY
TIED UP IN THE SHOW, RIGHT?

29:33.570 --> 29:36.869
- YES, THIS IS ALL MY MONEY
TIED UP IN THE SHOW,

29:36.900 --> 29:38.208
MONEY THAT
YOU WILL NEVER SEE.

29:38.240 --> 29:39.798
WHY?

29:39.840 --> 29:41.205
I D-DON'T UNDERSTAND.

29:41.240 --> 29:42.207
- OH, WELL,
LET ME SEE

29:42.240 --> 29:44.504
IF I CAN MAKE THIS
A LITTLE CLEARER FOR YOU.

29:44.550 --> 29:47.110
SABOTAGING YOUR OWN SHOW
IS THE ONLY WAY

29:47.150 --> 29:48.549
YOU CAN DIG YOURSELF
OUT OF THIS MONEY PIT.

29:48.580 --> 29:52.243
- WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO SEE THAT INSURANCE POLICY.

29:52.290 --> 29:56.351
- WOW, LOOK AT YOU TWO,
MR. AND MRS. POLICEMAN.

29:56.390 --> 29:58.529
I HATE TO BURST
YOUR BUBBLE

29:58.560 --> 30:00.050
AND WIPE THOSE SMILES
OFF YOUR FACES,

30:00.090 --> 30:03.389
BUT I'VE SOLD
THE SHOW TO NBC.

30:03.430 --> 30:06.467
SO WHY WOULD I
SABOTAGE THAT?

30:06.500 --> 30:08.229
- NBC, HUH?

30:08.270 --> 30:10.830
- YEAH.

30:10.870 --> 30:13.259
- WOW, THAT IS JUST
SUPER-IMPRESSIVE.

30:13.310 --> 30:14.299
WHO'S YOUR CONTACT
OVER THERE?

30:14.340 --> 30:16.934
BECAUSE MY OLD NEIGHBOR JAN'S
IN LEGAL AFFAIRS

30:16.980 --> 30:21.212
AND MAYBE THEY KNOW
EACH OTHER.

30:21.250 --> 30:23.844
- I'M HILTON FOX.
WELCOME BACK

30:23.890 --> 30:26.939
MELINDA, THE TIME HAS COME
FOR YOU TO CHOOSE

30:26.990 --> 30:29.015
WHO GETS
YOUR FINAL HEART.

30:29.060 --> 30:30.459
AND WHO GETS
SENT PACKING.

30:30.490 --> 30:33.459
AND WHATEVER HAPPENS TONIGHT,
YOU'RE NOT THE LOSER.

30:33.490 --> 30:36.288
ONE OF THEM IS.

30:36.330 --> 30:38.093
- OKAY.
SHAWN--

30:38.130 --> 30:39.529
- YES.

30:39.570 --> 30:43.597
- YOU ARE A VERY...
ODD PERSON.

30:43.640 --> 30:46.029
ONE MINUTE, YOU'RE WITTY

30:46.070 --> 30:48.231
AND SARCASTIC AND SMART.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.907
AND THE NEXT...

30:49.940 --> 30:52.306
YOU'RE LIKE A SIX-YEAR-OLD
LOOKING FOR A POPSICLE.

30:52.350 --> 30:54.318
- WE DON'T HAVE
ANY POPSICLES.

30:54.350 --> 30:56.875
I CHECKED--
I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN.

30:56.920 --> 30:59.047
[laughing]

30:59.090 --> 31:00.045
- AND GUS...

31:00.090 --> 31:01.250
- YES?

31:01.290 --> 31:04.259
- YOU'RE AN...OKAY GUY.

31:04.290 --> 31:06.155
- WELL...

31:06.190 --> 31:09.990
- AND I GUESS
I COULD SEE US TOGETHER.

31:10.030 --> 31:12.260
BUT YOUR FIANCEE

31:12.300 --> 31:13.665
TOOK YOUR HEART WITH HER

31:13.700 --> 31:18.399
WHEN SHE HIT THE GROUND
IN THAT NEVADA AIRFIELD, SO...

31:18.440 --> 31:22.399
- UH, BUT WHO'S GONNA HELP ME
RAISE MY LITTLE BOY, RONDELL?

31:22.440 --> 31:24.249
I CAN'T RAISE HIM ALONE.

31:24.280 --> 31:27.078
AND HIS BROTHER MELLARD.

31:27.110 --> 31:28.338
WHAT IS HE GONNA DO?

31:28.380 --> 31:29.540
AND WHAT ABOUT
HIS COUSIN RAY-JAY?

31:29.580 --> 31:33.687
- THAT'S A LOT OF KIDS
YOU HAVEN'T MENTIONED.

31:33.720 --> 31:36.416
UH, I'M GONNA
CHOOSE SHAWN.

31:36.460 --> 31:39.623
- LET'S TAKE A WALK
IN THE MEADOW.

31:39.660 --> 31:41.594
- [silently]

31:41.630 --> 31:46.465
HAVE FUN, KIDS.

31:46.500 --> 31:48.388
- [sighs]

31:48.440 --> 31:51.068
I'VE WATCHED THIS EXACT SCENE
ON TV SO MANY TIMES.

31:51.110 --> 31:52.964
[chuckles]

31:53.010 --> 31:56.275
I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ME
IN THE LIMO, DRIVING AWAY.

31:56.310 --> 31:58.403
[sniffles]

31:58.450 --> 32:02.147
BURTON GUSTER, YOU ARE NOT
GONNA CRY IN THIS LIMO.

32:02.180 --> 32:04.319
NOT TODAY.

32:04.350 --> 32:07.342
OH, NO, YOU'RE NOT.

32:15.430 --> 32:17.990
- SHAWN...

32:18.030 --> 32:21.659
DANCING HERE WITH YOU
UNDER THE MOONLIGHT...

32:21.700 --> 32:23.736
IT JUST...FEELS RIGHT.

32:23.770 --> 32:27.206
[cell phone rings]

32:27.240 --> 32:29.276
- OH, I GOTTA TAKE THIS.

32:29.310 --> 32:31.471
HOLD THAT THOUGHT, OKAY?

32:31.510 --> 32:33.375
JULES!

32:33.410 --> 32:34.411
- HEY, WE GOT GIANUKOS.

32:34.450 --> 32:37.317
YEAH, IT TURNS OUT
HE NEVER SOLD A SHOW TO NBC.

32:37.350 --> 32:38.385
LASSITER CALLED
HIS BLUFF.

32:38.420 --> 32:39.489
HE LIED SO THAT

32:39.520 --> 32:41.317
HE COULD GET A MASSIVE INSURANCE
POLICY ON THE SHOW,

32:41.360 --> 32:43.385
AND THEN HE COULD KILL
AND COLLECT.

32:43.420 --> 32:44.626
SO THANKS
FOR THE TIP, SHAWN.

32:44.660 --> 32:47.049
- THAT'S HOW I DO IT
WHEN I--WHEN I DO IT.

32:47.090 --> 32:48.694
- SO NOW YOU CAN GET
OFF THE SHOW.

32:48.730 --> 32:51.528
- BUT JULES,
I CAN WIN THIS THING.

32:51.570 --> 32:53.458
- DO YOU HEAR ME?

32:53.500 --> 32:56.094
OFF THE SHOW...NOW.

32:56.140 --> 32:59.303
- HEY.
THANK YOU.

32:59.340 --> 33:00.534
- SORRY.

33:00.570 --> 33:02.504
UH, WHERE--WHERE
WERE WE?

33:02.540 --> 33:07.375
- I JUST...I'M SORRY IF
I'M COMING ON A LITTLE STRONG.

33:07.410 --> 33:09.310
IT'S JUST THAT...

33:09.350 --> 33:10.578
SEE, I'VE ALWAYS...

33:10.620 --> 33:14.659
HAD THESE UNREALISTIC
EXPECTATIONS OF LOVE.

33:14.690 --> 33:16.419
WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE,

33:16.460 --> 33:19.054
IN A CREATIVE WRITING CLASS,

33:19.090 --> 33:24.096
I USED TO GET THESE LETTERS ON
MY DESK FROM A SECRET ADMIRER.

33:24.130 --> 33:25.688
THEY WOULD SAY
THINGS LIKE

33:25.730 --> 33:31.134
"THE HEART IS
THE ONLY MUSCLE IN THE BODY

33:31.170 --> 33:34.469
"THAT CAN BE BROKEN
BY A HARSH WORD--"

33:34.510 --> 33:39.277
- AND REPAIRED WITH
A GENTLE TOUCH.

33:42.820 --> 33:43.570
- SHAWN, WHY ARE YOU
SHOWING US THIS?

33:43.620 --> 33:45.485
- I JUST WANTED
TO SHOW YOU PROOF

33:45.520 --> 33:47.215
THAT I CARRIED MYSELF
LIKE A GENTLEMAN,

33:47.250 --> 33:48.683
AND DID THE RIGHT THING.

33:48.720 --> 33:53.748
FIRE HER UP, STEVE.

33:53.790 --> 33:57.248
[groans]

33:57.300 --> 33:59.825
- OH, NO.

33:59.870 --> 34:01.064
I'M S--I'M SO SORRY.

34:01.100 --> 34:02.533
I KNEW JAY'S ADVICE
WAS WRONG.

34:02.570 --> 34:04.504
MEN DON'T LIKE WOMEN
TO MAKE THE FIRST MOVE.

34:04.540 --> 34:05.802
- OH, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S NOT YOU.

34:05.840 --> 34:07.705
YOU'RE--YOU'RE
PERFECT ...-ISH.

34:07.740 --> 34:11.471
IT'S ME. I HAVE
A CONFESSION TO MAKE.

34:11.510 --> 34:12.670
[sighs]

34:12.710 --> 34:14.177
I'M NOT A DOCTOR.

34:14.220 --> 34:15.847
- YEAH, I KIND OF
FIGURED THAT

34:15.880 --> 34:18.781
WHEN YOU SAID YOU GRADUATED
FROM BOB HOSKINS MEDICAL SCHOOL.

34:18.820 --> 34:20.708
- THAT'S NOT ALL.

34:20.750 --> 34:23.856
I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

34:23.890 --> 34:26.825
AND THINGS ARE GOING
REALLY WELL.

34:26.860 --> 34:30.796
AND...WE FLIP IT AROUND
WHEN THE LIGHTS ARE DOWN

34:30.830 --> 34:32.388
THREE, FOUR TIMES A WEEK.

34:32.430 --> 34:33.795
SOMETIMES FIVE,
DEPENDING ON OUR CASE LOADS.

34:33.830 --> 34:35.468
- WHAT?

34:35.500 --> 34:36.831
WHY WOULD YOU DO
THIS TO ME?

34:36.870 --> 34:38.462
- LET ME EXPLAIN, OKAY?

34:38.510 --> 34:42.503
MY REAL JOB, MELINDA,
IS PSYCHIC DETECTIVE.

34:42.540 --> 34:45.179
I WAS BROUGHT IN HERE
TO SOLVE A CRIME.

34:45.210 --> 34:46.802
AND RIGHT NOW,
I AM SENSING

34:46.850 --> 34:49.239
THAT THIS BEAUTIFUL,
UNATTAINABLE LOVE

34:49.280 --> 34:54.513
THAT YOU SO DESPERATELY SEEK
IS NOT ONLY VERY REAL,

34:56.590 --> 35:00.321
BUT MUCH CLOSER
THAN YOU THINK.

35:00.360 --> 35:04.194
- DAN NY?

35:04.230 --> 35:07.620
- DANNY IS
THE ONE THAT WROTE

35:07.670 --> 35:10.195
ALL OF THOSE BEAUTIFUL
ANONYMOUS LETTERS TO YOU

35:10.240 --> 35:12.162
IN CREATIVE WRITING CLASS.

35:12.210 --> 35:15.338
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

35:15.380 --> 35:16.677
AND HE IS
THE ONLY ONE HERE

35:16.710 --> 35:19.599
THAT TRULY WANTS
TO PROTECT YOUR HEART.

35:19.650 --> 35:20.776
- THAT WAS YOU?

35:20.810 --> 35:22.744
WOW.

35:22.780 --> 35:24.384
- I'VE LOVED YOU
A LONG TIME.

35:24.420 --> 35:27.389
- YEAH.

35:27.420 --> 35:28.648
- WE'RE GOOD.
- YEAH.

35:28.690 --> 35:30.214
- THANK YOU.

35:30.260 --> 35:33.354
- AND LOVE CONEXION.

35:37.730 --> 35:39.425
WHOA, WHAT WAS THAT?

35:39.470 --> 35:41.267
LOOKS LIKE SOME
SORT OF GLITCH.

35:41.300 --> 35:42.836
- OH, WE CALL THAT
A JUMP CUT.

35:42.870 --> 35:44.701
JUST INDICATES A MISSING
PIECE OF FOOTAGE.

35:44.740 --> 35:46.264
- OR TIME.

35:46.310 --> 35:47.663
- IF SOMEONE REMOVED FOOTAGE,
WHERE WOULD IT GO?

35:47.710 --> 35:49.598
- OUTER SPACE, I BELIEVE.
CORRECT, STEVE?

35:49.640 --> 35:51.278
- UH, NO,
IT'S NOT CORRECT.

35:51.310 --> 35:52.800
BUT IT'S
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE

35:52.850 --> 35:54.477
TO MAKE FOOTAGE
DISAPPEAR PERMANENTLY.

35:54.520 --> 35:57.375
I'VE GOT IT BACKED UP ON, LIKE,
A MILLION DIFFERENT SOURCES.

35:57.420 --> 35:59.684
- HEY, STEVE, CAN YOU, UH, CAN
YOU BRING UP THE FOOTAGE

35:59.720 --> 36:02.814
FROM THE DAY DANNY ALMOST
GOT HIS FACE BURNED OFF?

36:02.860 --> 36:06.523
- YEAH.
- THANKS.

36:11.470 --> 36:13.199
THE REAPPEARING CUP.

36:13.230 --> 36:17.337
AND--AND CAN YOU SHOW US THE
RAW FOOTAGE FROM THE BEDROOM?

36:17.370 --> 36:20.669
THE NIGHT THOSE GLOVES
LANDED IN DANNY'S CUBBYHOLE.

36:20.710 --> 36:22.803
- 'KAY.

36:25.880 --> 36:26.847
- HAN K?

36:26.880 --> 36:28.848
- THE CAMERA GUY?

36:28.880 --> 36:29.949
- YOU PUT THE WRONG GUY
IN CUSTODY.

36:29.980 --> 36:31.686
JAY DIDN'T SABOTAGE
HIS OWN SHOW.

36:31.720 --> 36:32.687
- WHERE'S HANK NOW?

36:32.720 --> 36:34.813
- HE'S ON LOCATION FILMING
MELINDA AND DANNY

36:34.860 --> 36:36.782
FOR THE PROPOSAL DATE FINALE.

36:36.820 --> 36:38.822
- HAN K?

36:41.700 --> 36:47.696
[siren]

36:57.340 --> 36:58.807
GUS!
- WHAT?

36:58.850 --> 36:59.748
- LET'S GO!

36:59.780 --> 37:04.240
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

37:04.290 --> 37:06.588
- SPENCER, WHERE THE HELL
ARE YOU GOING?

37:06.620 --> 37:07.587
- DANNY!

37:07.620 --> 37:09.713
- SHAWN!

37:09.760 --> 37:11.682
- DON'T TAKE
THAT LEAP!

37:11.730 --> 37:13.721
- NO, SHAWN, DON'T WORRY.
WE TALKED ABOUT IT.

37:13.760 --> 37:15.728
WE'RE READY FOR THIS!

37:15.760 --> 37:17.728
- YEAH! WE'RE IN LOVE.

37:17.760 --> 37:19.819
- YEAH!
- THANKS TO YOU, SHAWN.

37:19.870 --> 37:22.839
- NO, NO, NO,
NOT THAT LEAP.

37:22.870 --> 37:23.962
THE CHUTE,
IT'S NOT SAFE!

37:24.000 --> 37:24.967
- WHAT?

37:25.010 --> 37:26.830
- THE CHUTE!

37:26.870 --> 37:29.737
- YEAH! NO,
IT'S THE FINAL SHOOT.

37:29.780 --> 37:32.271
[whooping]

37:32.310 --> 37:34.847
- SHAWN, SHAWN,
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,

37:34.880 --> 37:38.418
BUT THE LAST TIME I CHECKED,
I WASN'T FASTER THAN A PLANE.

37:38.450 --> 37:40.748
- YOU KNOW, BUDDY,
IN RETROSPECT,

37:40.790 --> 37:41.814
I MAY HAVE MISCALCULATED
ON THIS ONE.

37:41.860 --> 37:47.321
[sirens]

37:52.370 --> 37:54.838
[panﬁng]

37:54.870 --> 37:56.690
- PUT THE CAMERA DOWN.

37:56.740 --> 37:58.799
ARE YOU FILMING ME RIGHT NOW?
STOP FILMING ME!

37:58.840 --> 37:59.807
PUT IT DOWN!

37:59.840 --> 38:03.571
GET OUT HERE.

38:03.610 --> 38:04.747
- HANK, I KNOW
YOU WERE THE ONE

38:04.780 --> 38:06.407
THAT HAD THE IDEA
FOR THIS SHOW FIRST.

38:06.450 --> 38:09.840
BUT YOURS WAS CALLED
PASSING SHIPS.

38:09.880 --> 38:10.869
AM I RIGHT?

38:10.920 --> 38:12.581
- YES.

38:12.620 --> 38:14.019
- A SHOW ABOUT
A FEMALE CONTESTANT

38:14.050 --> 38:15.654
WHO'S REINTRODUCED

38:15.690 --> 38:17.715
TO SUITORS FROM HER PAST
WHO SHE COULD HAVE MET

38:17.760 --> 38:19.352
BUT OVERLOOKED.

38:19.390 --> 38:20.652
- HOW DID YOU--

38:20.690 --> 38:22.624
- IT'S MY SKILL SET, JACK.

38:22.660 --> 38:24.059
YOU THOUGHT JAY WAS
GONNA MAKE YOU A PARTNER,

38:24.100 --> 38:26.898
BUT INSTEAD HE WENT OUT,
SOLD THIS THING WITHOUT YOU.

38:26.930 --> 38:29.091
HE WAS LYING,
BUT YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

38:29.140 --> 38:31.631
WHEN JAY STARTED BRAGGING
ABOUT THE SHOW,

38:31.670 --> 38:33.865
YOU DECIDED YOU WERE
GONNA SABOTAGE THIS THING

38:33.910 --> 38:35.775
AT ALL COSTS TO MAKE SURE
IT WASN'T SUCCESSFUL.

38:35.810 --> 38:37.778
- HANK, STOP FILMING.

38:37.810 --> 38:40.574
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
YOU IDIOT?

38:40.610 --> 38:43.773
- THAT'S COLD, HANK.
COLD-BLOODED, HANK.

38:43.820 --> 38:47.813
YOUR FINAL PLAN WAS TO SWITCH
OUT DANNY BOY'S CHUTE...

38:50.060 --> 38:51.459
WITH GUS' DIRTY LAUNDRY.

38:51.490 --> 38:52.582
- THAT'S NOT
MY LAUNDRY, SHAWN.

38:52.630 --> 38:53.619
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

38:53.660 --> 38:55.093
- THAT'S NOT
MY LAUNDRY.

38:55.130 --> 38:56.893
- YOU SAYING I'M HOLDING ON
TO SOME RANDOM DUDE'S DRAWERS?

38:56.930 --> 38:58.466
- I GUESS SO.

38:58.500 --> 39:00.764
YOU TWO WERE GONNA FALL
TO YOUR DEATHS.

39:00.800 --> 39:02.688
- [gaSPSJ
LIKE YOUR POOR FIANCEE.

39:02.740 --> 39:03.638
- WHAT?

39:03.670 --> 39:05.604
- WAIT A MINUTE,
WHOSE DRAWERS ARE THESE?

39:05.640 --> 39:06.664
- I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW.

39:06.710 --> 39:07.768
- TAKE 'EM.

39:07.810 --> 39:08.777
- NO.
- TAKE THESE!

39:08.810 --> 39:09.731
- I DON'T WANT THEM, SHAWN.

39:09.780 --> 39:10.769
- TAKE THESE DRAWERS!

39:10.810 --> 39:12.778
- I AIN'T GONNA TAKE THEM.

39:12.810 --> 39:14.346
- TAKE 'EM!
SUCK 'EM!

39:18.120 --> 39:19.940
[cheering]

39:19.990 --> 39:22.379
- AND WELCOME BACK TO THE
PATHS OF LOVE REUNION SHOW

39:22.420 --> 39:24.888
WHERE WE CHECK IN AND SEE HOW
OUR BACHELORS HAVE BEEN DOING.

39:24.930 --> 39:26.579
FIRST THINGS FIRST,

39:26.630 --> 39:27.881
I WILL BE STARRING
IN A BRAND-NEW

39:27.930 --> 39:29.898
TYLER PERRY
SCI-FI EPIC CALLED

39:29.930 --> 39:32.865
I AIN'T GETTIN'
ON NO ROCKET.

39:32.900 --> 39:34.128
NOW THOSE OF YOU WHO CAUGHT
THE LAST EPISODE,

39:34.170 --> 39:36.092
YOU KNOW THAT SHAWN HAD A HAND
IN PLAYING CUPID.

39:36.140 --> 39:38.802
- OH, WHAT CAN I SAY?

39:38.840 --> 39:40.432
I LOVE MAKING LOVE.

39:42.140 --> 39:44.074
I HAD A FANTASTIC TIME
ON THE SHOW.

39:44.110 --> 39:46.078
- NOW THAT WASN'T
ALWAYS THE CASE.

39:46.110 --> 39:50.046
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF
YOUR HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE SHOW.

39:50.080 --> 39:51.718
- WHAT THE EFF?

39:51.750 --> 39:54.958
HEY, GUYS, COME ON.

39:54.990 --> 39:57.652
WHO DOESN'T PUT THE LID
ON THE ICE CREAM BACK?

39:57.690 --> 39:58.952
LOOK AT THIS,
WHAT IS THIS?

39:58.990 --> 39:59.957
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?
THAT'S FREEZER BURN.

39:59.990 --> 40:01.753
WE'RE BACHELORS,

40:01.800 --> 40:02.994
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT
WE'RE LIVING ALONE.

40:03.030 --> 40:05.590
THE FIRST THOUGHT THAT I HAD
WHEN I WALKED DOWN THOSE STAIRS

40:05.630 --> 40:07.518
AND SAW MELINDA
STANDING THERE,

40:07.570 --> 40:11.028
UM, IN THAT RUFFLY
DRESS, WAS, UM,

40:11.070 --> 40:13.061
"NOT BAD FOR A STAND-IN.

40:13.110 --> 40:16.136
"I WONDER, UH,
WHAT THE RE--

40:16.180 --> 40:19.445
WHAT THE ACTUAL BACHELORETTE
IS GONNA LOOK LIKE."

40:19.480 --> 40:22.972
* MELINDA'S FACE

40:23.020 --> 40:26.888
* IS ON TOP OF HER NECK

40:26.920 --> 40:29.115
* MELINDA'S FACE
IS UNDER HER HAIR *

40:29.160 --> 40:30.787
* UNDER HER HAIR,
UNDER HER HAIR *

40:30.820 --> 40:33.721
- SHAWN AND GUS, THAT WAS A
REALLY INTERESTING RELATIONSHIP.

40:33.760 --> 40:38.220
IT WAS KIND OF HARD TO...
PENETRATE THAT TWOSOME.

40:38.260 --> 40:40.660
INITIALLY, WHEN THEY CAME
INTO THE HOUSE,

40:40.700 --> 40:45.205
I, UM, I ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT
THEY MAY HAVE BEEN TOGETHER.

40:45.240 --> 40:48.164
I MEAN, THEY'RE REALLY
INTO EACH OTHER.

40:48.210 --> 40:50.007
LIKE, REALLY INTO
EACH OTHER.

40:50.040 --> 40:53.248
YOU WERE SUCH A CUTE BABY.

40:53.280 --> 40:56.147
AND TO THINK, THAT LITTLE BUNDLE
GREW UP TO BE A SURGEON.

40:56.180 --> 40:57.647
DID YOU HAVE
A FEELING?

40:57.680 --> 40:59.989
- SHAWN, THE SURGEON, YES, YES.

41:00.020 --> 41:01.612
I, WE--YEAH, YEAH, COME ON,
IT'S NO WONDER.

41:01.660 --> 41:04.720
HE WAS ALWAYS INTERESTED
IN MEDICINE, AND UH, HE...

41:04.760 --> 41:06.955
I-I'M--I'M SORRY,
I-I-I CAN'T DO THIS.

41:06.990 --> 41:10.027
THIS--THIS--THIS GIRL
IS WAY TOO GOOD FOR MY SON.

41:10.060 --> 41:12.096
- NO...

41:12.130 --> 41:12.994
- I-I WOULDN'T VOTE
FOR HIM.

41:13.030 --> 41:13.997
- [nervous laughter]

41:14.030 --> 41:16.089
- YOUR CALL.

41:16.140 --> 41:17.892
- WOW.

41:17.940 --> 41:18.907
- IS THIS A JOKE?

41:18.940 --> 41:20.066
- COME BACK OVER HERE.

41:20.110 --> 41:21.008
HAVE SOME MORE LEMONADE.

41:21.040 --> 41:22.007
- I DON'T WANT ANY LEMONADE!

41:22.040 --> 41:24.873
[laughter]

41:24.910 --> 41:27.845
- WOW, WELL, THAT IS
A PATHS OF LOVE FIRST.

41:27.880 --> 41:30.041
WE'VE NOW SAVED
THE BEST FOR LAST.

41:30.080 --> 41:32.116
DANNY...

41:32.150 --> 41:34.289
IT'S HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT YOU
WOULD BE SITTING IN THAT CHAIR

41:34.320 --> 41:36.618
IF NOT FOR THE TWO-MONTH
MEDICALLY-INDUCED COMA

41:36.660 --> 41:38.525
OF THIS GENTLEMAN.

41:38.560 --> 41:41.996
BACHELORS, PUT YOUR HANDS
TOGETHER FOR TODD KRAMER.

41:42.030 --> 41:43.998
ALIVE AND WELL.

41:44.030 --> 41:49.036
[applause and cheering]

41:54.010 --> 41:55.898
- HEY.
- WOW.

41:55.940 --> 41:57.999
- I WAS DREAMING ABOUT YOU
IN THE COMA.

41:58.040 --> 41:59.246
- OH, OKAY.

41:59.280 --> 42:02.670
- I GOTTA TELL YOU, IT IS ROUGH
OUT THERE IN THE REAL WORLD.

42:02.720 --> 42:05.211
BEING SINGLE
AND HUNTING FOR LOVE.

42:05.250 --> 42:07.013
- YEAH, BUT IT'S--
IT'S NOT THE REAL WORLD, SHAWN.

42:07.050 --> 42:09.951
IT'S A TV SHOW.

42:09.990 --> 42:12.185
- HEY, HEY.
OKAY.

42:12.230 --> 42:16.098
- OH, MY GOD.

42:16.130 --> 42:18.325
- I'M SAYING IT'S NICE, IT'S
NICE THAT YOU'RE IN MY LIFE.

42:18.360 --> 42:21.636
YOU KNOW?
THAT YOU'RE ALWAYS

42:21.670 --> 42:22.694
STANDING BY MY SIDE.

42:22.740 --> 42:25.106
IT FEELS GOOD.

42:25.140 --> 42:26.107
FEELS RIGHT.

42:26.140 --> 42:28.131
HUH?

42:28.170 --> 42:30.001
JULES?
- WHAT?

42:34.010 --> 42:35.739
- * I KNOW YOU KNOW

42:35.780 --> 42:37.816
* THAT I'M NOT TELLING
THE TRUTH *

42:37.850 --> 42:39.215
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

42:39.250 --> 42:40.888
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF *

42:40.920 --> 42:42.615
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

42:42.660 --> 42:44.059
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

42:44.090 --> 42:45.682
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

42:45.730 --> 42:48.051
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

42:48.090 --> 42:48.158
* I KNOW YOU KNOW
