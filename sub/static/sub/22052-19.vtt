unannounced.

18:49.834 --> 18:54.767
then was supposed to leave
tomorrow.

18:54.767 --> 18:57.400
Um, hold on.
Can we not film me while I'm on

18:57.400 --> 18:59.900
the phone?
Thank you.

18:59.900 --> 19:07.767
And so...
>> KHLOE: She's a waste.

19:07.767 --> 19:09.734
>> KIM: Kourtney's on this deep
conversation.

19:09.734 --> 19:12.533
She's literally never present.
She's always on the phone.

19:12.533 --> 19:15.400
She can't even live in the
moment, 'cause she has whatever

19:15.400 --> 19:18.367
drama's going on.
I assume that it has something

19:18.367 --> 19:22.066
to do with Scott and Younes.
I think she just needs to really

19:22.066 --> 19:25.200
figure out what these boundaries
are, 'cause it's getting messy,

19:25.200 --> 19:27.800
and it's getting annoying.
And it's taking away time from

19:27.800 --> 19:32.300
our, like, sister time.
>> KOURTNEY: Guys, there's the

19:32.300 --> 19:33.633
chocolate sign, from the
place...

19:33.633 --> 19:35.934
>> KHLOE: What the  are
you here for?

19:35.934 --> 19:38.166
Don't chime in if you're not
gonna get get on your

19:38.166 --> 19:40.867
phone call all the time.
>> KOURTNEY: Have fun tonight.

19:40.867 --> 19:43.333
Okay, bye.
>> KHLOE: You're, like, a waste

19:43.333 --> 19:46.734
of space in my meter right now.
>> KOURTNEY: I'm looking at

19:46.734 --> 19:48.467
everything.
>> KHLOE: You're annoying as

19:48.467 --> 19:50.734
now that, when we're
together, like, this is what you

19:50.734 --> 19:52.667
do, you're on your phone the
whole time.

19:52.667 --> 19:56.000
You're just not present.
>> KOURTNEY: I had a ten-minute

19:56.000 --> 19:59.367
conversation with Sarah, and
that's offensive?

19:59.367 --> 20:00.700
>> KIM: Yeah.
>> KHLOE: Yes, because we're

20:00.700 --> 20:02.467
only here once.
When are we ever gonna go back

20:02.467 --> 20:03.867
to Alcatraz?
>> KOURTNEY: But we were sitting

20:03.867 --> 20:05.533
down in a cafeteria on a bench.
>> KHLOE: You know what?

20:05.533 --> 20:06.900
Actually, I'm not doing this
today.

20:06.900 --> 20:08.500
I'm not doing this today,
because last time in Costa

20:08.500 --> 20:09.667
Rica...
>> KIM: Throw her over.

20:09.667 --> 20:11.500
>> KHLOE: ...I looked crazy,
'cause I'm always the one

20:11.500 --> 20:13.467
complaining to get you guys to
have fun.

20:13.467 --> 20:16.800
I'm not gonna be crazy, okay?
You'll be the  bitch that

20:16.800 --> 20:18.300
you need to be shown that you
are.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.500
>> KOURTNEY:  you, you
whore.

20:20.500 --> 20:22.367

20:24.200 --> 20:32.433
>> KOURTNEY: That's what I told
you before, you .

20:32.433 --> 20:35.400
>> KHLOE: The doctor said she
was calling you with my results

20:35.400 --> 20:38.400
35 minutes ago.
>> KYLIE: Okay.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.300
Did she call you?
>> KHLOE: No!

20:40.300 --> 20:41.934
>> KIM: What?
>> KYLIE: Are you ready?

20:41.934 --> 20:49.133
Who's there
>> KHLOE: Say it!

20:49.133 --> 20:51.000
>> KIM: What sucks is that they
would escape probably in the

20:51.000 --> 20:53.967
middle of the night, so they'd
have to swim in this water.

20:53.967 --> 20:56.533
>> KHLOE: I would never, ever
swim at night.

20:56.533 --> 20:57.967
I barely swim in the day.
>> MICHAEL: Hi, there.

20:57.967 --> 20:59.233
>> KIM: Hi.
>> MICHAEL: Hi, nice to meet

20:59.233 --> 21:00.400
you.
>> KIM: How are you?

21:00.400 --> 21:01.800
You, too, I'm Kim.
>> MICHAEL: Nice to meet you,

21:01.800 --> 21:02.800
Kim.
>> KOURTNEY: Hi.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.300
>> MICHAEL: Hi.
So we're gonna go in this door

21:04.300 --> 21:06.667
here.
This place was created for the

21:06.667 --> 21:08.900
worst of the worst.
It was considered the cream of

21:08.900 --> 21:10.400
the criminal crop.
>> KHLOE: "Break the rules and

21:10.400 --> 21:12.633
you go to prison, break the
prison rules and you go to

21:12.633 --> 21:16.333
Alcatraz."
>> KIM: Oh, yes.

21:16.333 --> 21:17.867
>> KHLOE: Whoa.
>> MICHAEL: So this is Alcatraz.

21:17.867 --> 21:19.266
>> KHLOE: Wow.
>> MICHAEL: And this is

21:19.266 --> 21:20.867
Broadway.
>> KIM: Wait, Kourt, your hand.

21:20.867 --> 21:23.266
>> KHLOE: Kourt, stop being a
bitch.

21:23.266 --> 21:27.567
>> KOURTNEY: I hate you both.
I feel like I was a little bit

21:27.567 --> 21:29.567
distracted.
I've been distracted about this

21:29.567 --> 21:33.400
boundary issue with Scott, and
maybe I just need to deal with

21:33.400 --> 21:38.533
this when I get back to L.A.
So from now on, I'm going to

21:38.533 --> 21:41.767
just be totally present in this
trip, and just, like, have an

21:41.767 --> 21:44.667
amazing time with my sisters.
Excuse me.

21:44.667 --> 21:50.100
We've got a felon on the loose.

21:50.100 --> 21:53.800
She's beating me up.
She needs to be put back in her

21:53.800 --> 21:56.500
cell, please.
>> KHLOE: That's a good one.

21:56.500 --> 21:58.200
>> KOURTNEY: They're on the way.
>> KHLOE: Okay.

21:58.200 --> 22:00.066

you didn't come up with that on

22:02.734 --> 22:04.734
>> KHLOE: Look how small their
cell... is this how big current

22:04.734 --> 22:07.066
cells are now?
>> MICHAEL: No, I think a lot of

22:07.066 --> 22:09.934
them are a lot bigger than this,
but this is a five-by-nine cell.

22:09.934 --> 22:12.367

22:12.367 --> 22:14.166

here.

Capone lived on Alcatraz.

27:39.233 --> 27:42.333
>> KIM: I kind of am, too.
>> KHLOE: I have such anxiety

27:42.333 --> 27:44.700
and nerves to find out what I'm
having, but, like, oh, I just

27:44.700 --> 27:54.133
need Kylie to  call me.
Like, what is she doing?

27:57.967 --> 28:01.033
The doctor said she was calling
you with my results 35 minutes

28:01.033 --> 28:03.600
ago.
>> KYLIE: Okay, did she call

28:03.600 --> 28:05.767
you?
>> KHLOE: No!

28:05.767 --> 28:07.266
>> KIM: What?
>> KYLIE: Are you ready?

28:07.266 --> 28:09.433
Who's there
>> KHLOE: Say it!

28:09.433 --> 28:11.100
>> KYLIE: Who's there?
>> KIM: It's me!

28:11.100 --> 28:13.934
>> KHLOE: It's me and Kim.
>> KYLIE: Okay, are you sitting?

28:13.934 --> 28:15.834
>> KHLOE: Kylie, say it!

28:17.967 --> 28:22.166
>> KOURTNEY: I just felt like we
should discuss some of the

28:22.166 --> 28:25.767
boundaries in the house.
Scott and I get along, but

28:25.767 --> 28:35.066
there's also things that need
to be said.

28:35.066 --> 28:36.667
>> KYLIE: Who's there?
>> KIM: It's me!

28:36.667 --> 28:38.767
>> KHLOE: Me and Kim.
>> KYLIE: Okay, are you sitting?

28:38.767 --> 28:43.166
>> KHLOE: Kylie, say it!
>> KYLIE: You're having a girl.

28:43.166 --> 28:45.734
>> KHLOE: You're lying.
>> KYLIE: I'm not lying.

28:45.734 --> 28:48.600
>> KHLOE: Shut up.
>> KYLIE: I'm so excited for

28:48.600 --> 28:50.200
you, Khloe!
>> KHLOE: Is she lying or

28:50.200 --> 28:51.800
serious?
>> KIM: Kylie, are you serious?

28:51.800 --> 28:53.467
>> KYLIE: Why would I lie about
this?

28:53.467 --> 28:55.700
>> KHLOE: I don't feel like I'm
having a girl.

28:55.700 --> 28:59.400
>> KIM: That's so exciting.
>> KYLIE: I'm, like, so excited.

28:59.400 --> 29:03.100
>> KIM: This is so exciting.
It's okay, I cried when I found

29:03.100 --> 29:05.233
out North was gonna be a girl,
too.

29:05.233 --> 29:07.333
>> KHLOE: I don't feel like I'm
having a girl at all.

29:07.333 --> 29:10.233
I'm, like, in a state of shock.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.066
>> KOURTNEY: What?
It's a girl?

29:16.066 --> 29:19.200
It is?
What? I'm shocked.

29:19.200 --> 29:22.734
I'm shocked.
>> KHLOE: when you have your

29:22.734 --> 29:25.633
mind made up as to, like, what
you're having-- like, everyone

29:25.633 --> 29:27.900
told me, "You're gonna feel what
you're having, and you'll just

29:27.900 --> 29:30.133
kind of know."
And then when you find out it's

29:30.133 --> 29:32.567
the complete opposite, it's just
a shock.

29:32.567 --> 29:37.166
I just was convinced that I was
having a boy, so to be having a

29:37.166 --> 29:39.934
girl, it's just like, "Okay,
that wasn't what I thought was

29:39.934 --> 29:43.400
going on."

29:43.400 --> 29:45.166
>> KIM: Tell mom not to tell
Tristan, though.

29:45.166 --> 29:47.400
>> KRIS: Hi.
>> KHLOE: Hi, Mom.

29:47.400 --> 29:50.400
Do you want to know what I'm
having?

29:50.400 --> 29:54.000
>> KRIS: Yes!
>> KHLOE: I'm having a girl.

29:54.000 --> 29:59.734
>> KRIS : Oh, my God.
That is so amazing!

29:59.734 --> 30:02.633
>> KHLOE: I really hope they...
I'm really hoping Kylie's gonna

30:02.633 --> 30:05.667
say she's lying and, like, I'm
really having a boy.

30:05.667 --> 30:10.200
>> KRIS: Khloe, the only thing I
wanted in life, the only thing,

30:10.200 --> 30:13.867
was a boy.
Three times, and I got the three

30:13.867 --> 30:18.066
of you.
But a man is much more attached

30:18.066 --> 30:20.500
to a girl.
>> KHLOE: Totally, and I know

30:20.500 --> 30:23.100
Tristan will be in love, and
I'll be in love, and she'll be

30:23.100 --> 30:26.533
so cute and whatever, but...
>> KRIS: This will be the love

30:26.533 --> 30:28.734
of his life, no offense to you.
But this will be the love of his

30:28.734 --> 30:31.233
life.
>> KHLOE: Well, then, I'm gonna

30:31.233 --> 30:34.834
get jealous, and I'm jealous.
>> KRIS: You probably will.

30:34.834 --> 30:38.166
>> KHLOE: Well, then, I don't
like that, I don't like her.

30:38.166 --> 30:43.166

Don't be a bitch.

She was, like, fully dressed in

keeping her glam in case
something... in case Kendall...

gonna maybe come out with you,

unless Kendall went.

31:21.834 --> 31:27.333
Um, anyways...
I just felt like we should

discuss some of the boundaries
in the house.

31:33.166 --> 31:37.767
Scott and I get along, but I do
always get a little bit nervous

31:37.767 --> 31:41.300
to have these kind of
conversations with him and,

31:41.300 --> 31:44.433
like, set boundaries, because
it's, like, awkward to have to

31:44.433 --> 31:47.567
say something that he may not
like, or that he may take the

31:47.567 --> 31:50.166
wrong way.
Like, we both just want to get

31:50.166 --> 31:58.200
along, but then there's also
things that need to be said.

All righty.

32:00.600 --> 32:03.600
My surrogate is in town, so I
thought it would be an amazing

32:03.600 --> 32:07.133
time for her to meet my family.
Guys, I want you to meet

32:07.133 --> 32:10.133
La'Reina.
>> KOURTNEY: I didn't think you

32:10.133 --> 32:11.767
were coming.
>> YOUNES: I was like, "I have

32:11.767 --> 32:19.100
to support you."
>> KOURTNEY: Thank you.

32:19.100 --> 32:22.100
>> KOURTNEY: I just felt like we
should discuss some of the

32:22.100 --> 32:24.300
boundaries in the house.

32:26.433 --> 32:29.467
Like, I feel like, sometimes,
because this was your house,

32:29.467 --> 32:33.100
sometimes, I feel like you walk
in like it still is.

32:33.100 --> 32:35.900
>> SCOTT: Yeah, I understand.
>> KOURTNEY: And so, I feel like

32:35.900 --> 32:39.033
it has to make sense for my
relationship, too, and just,

32:39.033 --> 32:42.633
like, if you just, like, wander
into my bedroom and go "Hey, can

32:42.633 --> 32:44.300
I see all your sunglasses,
and..."

32:44.300 --> 32:46.400
>> SCOTT: Well, there...
I was getting my sunglasses, but

32:46.400 --> 32:47.734
okay.
>> KOURTNEY: No, you said, "Hey,

32:47.734 --> 32:49.400
can I look at all your
sunglasses?

32:49.400 --> 32:51.300
I think you have some of mine."
>> SCOTT: And you did.

32:51.300 --> 32:54.467
>> KOURTNEY: But you, like, look
through them all, just to...

32:54.467 --> 32:56.834
>> SCOTT: I wasn't looking
through your panties.

32:56.834 --> 32:59.800
I understand the boundary of not
going into your bedroom, 'cause

32:59.800 --> 33:02.000
that's a private place for you.
>> KOURTNEY: But then, the day

33:02.000 --> 33:04.367
after I said it, you went right
in.

33:04.367 --> 33:06.200
>> SCOTT:  Really?
>> KOURTNEY: You said, "Hey, can

33:06.200 --> 33:08.133
I come in?"
And the kids were there-- I

33:08.133 --> 33:10.266
wasn't gonna be like, "No."
>> SCOTT: Okay.

33:10.266 --> 33:12.233
There's obviously some
boundaries that we both need to

33:12.233 --> 33:14.467
respect, and I don't want you to
be uncomfortable.

33:14.467 --> 33:15.967
>> KOURTNEY: No, I'm not
uncomfortable, I'm just

33:15.967 --> 33:17.600
saying that that's...
>> SCOTT: Oh, so then, the next

33:17.600 --> 33:19.867
time, I'll be up there naked.
>> KOURTNEY: Great.

33:19.867 --> 33:22.333
I'll call the police.
>> SCOTT:

33:22.333 --> 33:24.433
I get it.
All things that are

33:24.433 --> 33:26.433
understandable, in this
co-parenting life.

33:26.433 --> 33:28.700
I was also thinking I have a
boundary.

33:28.700 --> 33:30.033
>> KOURTNEY: Mm
>> SCOTT: I don't really want

33:30.033 --> 33:31.667
to, like, hug anymore.
I think we should just shake

33:31.667 --> 33:33.000
hands when we see each other.
>> KOURTNEY: Okay.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.533
>> SCOTT: Is that cool?
>> KOURTNEY: We could do a high

33:34.533 --> 33:36.467
five.
>> SCOTT: Nah, that's too young.

33:36.467 --> 33:38.133
>> KOURTNEY: Or we could do a...

33:38.133 --> 33:39.433
>> SCOTT: Ooh, a fist pump?
>> KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm.

33:39.433 --> 33:40.800
>> SCOTT: I'll meet you in the
middle there.

33:40.800 --> 33:42.300
>> KOURTNEY: Okay.

33:42.300 --> 33:44.400
that, I'm cool with your stuff.
>> KOURTNEY: Okay.

33:44.400 --> 33:46.734

Oh, yeah.

33:53.767 --> 33:56.200
Hold on... 20.
Kylie, you're like a chameleon.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.867
>> KYLIE: Ooh!
>> KHLOE: You look just like Kim

33:57.867 --> 34:01.133
when you want to, and then like
me when you smile.

34:01.133 --> 34:02.934

Khloe?

34:02.934 --> 34:08.800

34:08.800 --> 34:10.533
>> KHLOE: Hello.
>> KIM: Hey.

34:10.533 --> 34:12.800
What are you doing?
>> KHLOE: I have the

34:12.800 --> 34:15.333
Bloomingdale's appearance.
What is happening over there?

34:15.333 --> 34:18.033
>> KIM: He's playing this bird,
like, it yodels.

34:18.033 --> 34:19.533
And I'm like...
>> KOURTNEY: Khloe got it for

34:19.533 --> 34:20.934
them.
And they love it.

34:20.934 --> 34:23.834
>> KIM: Well, now we can pay you
back, and get your daughter a

34:23.834 --> 34:29.166
full drum set, and, like,
electric guitar.

34:29.166 --> 34:31.467
>> KHLOE: Oh, lovely.
Can't wait for that.

34:31.467 --> 34:33.467
>> KIM: Wait, so, tell me
everything about Tristan's

34:33.467 --> 34:35.300
reaction.

34:35.300 --> 34:38.433
>> KHLOE: We were at the game,
and I was having the room, like,

34:38.433 --> 34:40.767
decorated and everything.
>> KIM: So did he know that when

34:40.767 --> 34:43.000
he was gonna come home, he was
gonna see something?

34:43.000 --> 34:45.400
>> KHLOE: No.
>> KIM: Oh, he didn't?

34:45.400 --> 34:49.567
>> KHLOE: No, he had no idea.
Tristan kept asking me, "So I

34:49.567 --> 34:52.834
wonder how you're gonna tell me,
uh, the gender of the baby."

34:52.834 --> 34:55.200
I'm thinking, "I wonder how I'm
gonna tell you-- what does that

34:55.200 --> 34:56.867
mean?"
Like, so, he kind of wanted it

34:56.867 --> 35:00.500
to be a big deal on his end,
which I think is the cutest

35:00.500 --> 35:03.633
thing ever.
I had everyone come after he

35:03.633 --> 35:08.000
left to go to work, and then, we
did the room.

35:08.000 --> 35:12.533
But he was in such a bad mood
because of the game, on the car

35:12.533 --> 35:14.934
ride home, I was just like, "Oh,
no, this is, like, maybe not the

35:14.934 --> 35:16.900
best time," but I was like,
"There's nothing I can do.

35:16.900 --> 35:19.533
I can't clean it all up."
So when we came home, I sped in

35:19.533 --> 35:22.233
front of him and, like, ran
upstairs so I could shut the

35:22.233 --> 35:24.333
door, and I was like, "Will he
think it's weird I, like,

35:24.333 --> 35:27.500
slammed the door in his face?"
And he was just, he did it.

35:27.500 --> 35:30.934
And he opened the door, and he
was so excited.

35:30.934 --> 35:35.967
>> TRISTAN: Oh, my God.
Oh!

35:35.967 --> 35:39.066
My vision was right, I knew it.
>> KHLOE: Now, he'll be like,

35:39.066 --> 35:41.700
"How's my princess doing?"
"I just want to check on my two

35:41.700 --> 35:43.867
girls," like, he's so cute about
everything.

35:43.867 --> 35:46.000
>> KIM: Are you, like, more
excited now?

35:46.000 --> 35:49.734
>> KHLOE: I still feel so bad,
how I felt, but that's just how

35:49.734 --> 35:52.367
I felt.
And I, like, think about North,

35:52.367 --> 35:55.133
or P, like, "Okay, like, it's
gonna be so cute."

35:55.133 --> 35:57.200
And I am getting more excited.
>> KIM: Yeah.

35:57.200 --> 35:59.300
It's fun, it's, like, girl's
time, and then we get to do it

35:59.300 --> 36:03.100
again.
>> KHLOE: Totally.

36:03.100 --> 36:06.767
I was looking at nurseries for
boys, and I just think you need,

36:06.767 --> 36:09.400
like, a day or two to just let
it sink in.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.800
Then you get over it.
I mean, and honestly, girl stuff

36:11.800 --> 36:15.834
is so much cuter anyway, and
it'll be so cute to have just a

36:15.834 --> 36:19.600
little girl in the stands, like,
rooting for her dad.

36:19.600 --> 36:22.166
Like, I know girls think their
dads are everything and then

36:22.166 --> 36:24.834
some.
>> KIM: Yeah, I'm honestly so

36:24.834 --> 36:27.233
excited that Khloe's having a
girl.

36:27.233 --> 36:29.934
I've been, like, getting, like,
me and Khloe things for, like,

36:29.934 --> 36:33.066
our girls, and it's probably
gonna be so annoying, but

36:33.066 --> 36:35.333
they're all gonna, like, have
the same things, do the same

36:35.333 --> 36:37.867
things, be in the same class.
>> KHLOE: So cute.

36:37.867 --> 36:40.233
See, that makes me excited.
>> KIM: Yeah.

36:40.233 --> 36:42.467
>> REIGN: Bless you, Koko.

36:48.600 --> 36:50.767
you.

36:50.767 --> 36:53.633

things here or there, but I like
being pregnant, and I know that

sounds really weird.

>> KHLOE: Okay.
>> LA'REINA: So I've had two

40:20.400 --> 40:22.600
boys, God gave me two boys, and
then for the surrogate babies,

40:22.600 --> 40:24.600
it was two girls.
>> KHLOE: But emotionally, for

40:24.600 --> 40:28.734
you, is it, like, super, like,
depressing, or...

40:28.734 --> 40:30.233
>> LA'REINA: No.
>> KHLOE: ...something after the

40:30.233 --> 40:31.967
fact?
>> LA'REINA: No. Because I know

40:31.967 --> 40:35.667
from the very beginning this is
not my baby, at the end my joy

40:35.667 --> 40:39.667
and my satisfaction is with
whoever I'm having the baby for.

40:39.667 --> 40:42.934
So when the baby comes out,
they're just like, "Okay, well,

40:42.934 --> 40:44.967
do you want skin on skin?"
I'm like, "No. Let her go to her

40:44.967 --> 40:46.467
mom.
>> KENDALL: What does "skin on

40:46.467 --> 40:48.467
skin" mean?
>> KRIS: When they put the baby

40:48.467 --> 40:50.467
on your chest.
Like, when... if you gave

40:50.467 --> 40:53.333
birth, then the baby would come
up, and you would... go right on

40:53.333 --> 40:56.066
your chest to feel your heart on
heart, and just the whole

40:56.066 --> 40:59.200
bonding thing that's really
amazing in the first few minutes

40:59.200 --> 41:01.867
of birth.
Did you want to hold her?

41:01.867 --> 41:05.233
>> LA'REINA: Um, not... I didn't
feel the need to, but, I mean, I

41:05.233 --> 41:07.600
love babies, so it was nice for
me to hold her.

41:07.600 --> 41:09.967
>> KHLOE: You're just very
matter-of-fact about it.

41:09.967 --> 41:12.467
>> LA'REINA: Yeah, I really am.
It's... 'Cause I know what my

41:12.467 --> 41:15.166
job is in all of it, you know
what I'm saying, and it's, like,

41:15.166 --> 41:17.767

41:24.600 --> 41:27.266
into it, I really didn't know
what to expect, 'cause I don't

41:27.266 --> 41:30.433
really know anyone that's gone
through this.

41:30.433 --> 41:33.467
It was definitely not as easy as
I thought it would be,

41:33.467 --> 41:37.767
emotionally, but it's so worth
it, and our surrogate is such a

41:37.767 --> 41:41.633
