02:05.667 --> 02:08.919
Once upon a time
in a magical kingdom

02:08.919 --> 02:10.878
known as New York City,

02:10.878 --> 02:14.341
in a city that doesn't sleep,
but sleeps around a lot,

02:14.342 --> 02:17.679
a land of dollar pizza
and crowded subways,

02:17.679 --> 02:19.472
there lived two millennials

02:19.472 --> 02:22.559
cursed with the paradox
of choice.

02:22.558 --> 02:26.103
Like many stories, ours begins
on a phone screen

02:26.104 --> 02:28.940
on the latest dating app
called Meet Cute.

02:30.984 --> 02:34.279
She was Wendy Brinkley, a name
derived from the character

02:34.278 --> 02:36.739
who dated the boy
who never grew up.

02:36.740 --> 02:39.409
Wendy scoured her albums
for a photo

02:39.408 --> 02:42.286
that didn't include necks...

02:42.287 --> 02:46.499
and cautiously accepted
her new destiny.

02:51.920 --> 02:53.922
Then there was Milo Marks

02:53.923 --> 02:57.218
and his 77 unread
text messages.

02:57.217 --> 02:59.678
To Milo, Meet Cute
was just another app

02:59.679 --> 03:01.473
for his dedicated folder.

03:03.307 --> 03:05.351
Milo was a 5'8"...

03:06.186 --> 03:07.729
10?

03:07.729 --> 03:09.856
5'8", born-and-raised
New Yorker

03:09.855 --> 03:11.899
who had no shortage of selfies

03:11.900 --> 03:14.652
that he justified as self-love.

03:14.651 --> 03:16.570
The app asked you
a few questions,

03:16.570 --> 03:18.864
then wrote your own
personal love story.

03:24.496 --> 03:27.624
Romantically, Milo knew
what he wanted,

03:27.623 --> 03:32.044
as did Wendy, but she was
too afraid to admit it.

03:32.044 --> 03:34.129
They had nothing in common,

03:34.129 --> 03:37.966
except an idealized version
of modern romance.

03:37.967 --> 03:39.803
With their profiles set,

03:39.802 --> 03:43.514
they swiped left,
they swiped right.

03:43.514 --> 03:47.935
But one day,
thanks to some magic
and an algorithm,

03:47.936 --> 03:50.313
they had their Meet Cute.

03:51.814 --> 03:53.565
They met at a cute little spot

03:53.566 --> 03:55.610
in the West Village
called Lylis.

03:55.610 --> 03:58.279
Milo found it
on the Infatuation's list

03:58.278 --> 04:01.073
of best bars where you won't
run into an ex.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.284
-He never came back from London.
-He never came back?

04:03.283 --> 04:06.829
-Never came back.
-Does he still have your nudes,
by any chance?

04:06.830 --> 04:09.916
Um, what, are you afraid of him
leaking your nudes?

04:09.915 --> 04:11.792
-Sorry, that was
a weird question.
-If he ever did,

04:11.793 --> 04:14.170
I have nudes of him
that are not as favorable.

04:14.169 --> 04:16.005
Really?
He has peasant nudes.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.839
-What is your baggage?
-I just don't have any.

04:17.841 --> 04:19.884
-Wow.
-Yeah, I checked my baggage.

04:19.884 --> 04:22.053
-No baggage, no nudes?
-Just got my MacBook
in a tote bag.

04:22.052 --> 04:23.637
-Oh.
-Might get some work done
on this flight.

04:23.637 --> 04:25.931
What does it feel like
to be so perfect?

04:25.932 --> 04:29.811
Basically, what I tell people
is like I'm just like you,
except perfect.

04:29.810 --> 04:31.937
-Wow. Oh, my God.

04:31.937 --> 04:33.939
Thank you so much
for getting a drink with me.

04:33.939 --> 04:36.233
I don't even know how I made it
through my life

04:36.233 --> 04:38.902
until this moment.

04:38.903 --> 04:42.657
But, no, honestly, I think
whenever I meet someone,

04:42.656 --> 04:45.325
I create this fantasy version
of this person.

04:45.326 --> 04:47.704
And then the more
that we get to know each other,

04:47.704 --> 04:51.124
the more that fantasy
just sort of whittles away,

04:51.124 --> 04:55.503
and then all that's left
is, like, this real person.

04:55.502 --> 05:00.341
And a lot of the time,
I don't like the real person

05:00.341 --> 05:02.134
as much as I like
the fantasy person.

05:02.134 --> 05:05.888
Sounds like you idealize
and then devalue.

05:08.223 --> 05:10.559
It's a very clinical language.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.645
-Spot-on.
-Thank you.

05:12.644 --> 05:15.898
-Um, I'm gonna go
to the bathroom, okay?
-Wait, wait, wait.

05:15.899 --> 05:18.610
Do you actually have to go
or do you just wanna check
your phone?

05:18.610 --> 05:21.780
If you just wanna check
your phone, we could do
a mutual check right now.

05:21.779 --> 05:24.698
-I would love
to just check my phone.
-Okay, okay, me too.

05:24.699 --> 05:27.702
-I could use a hit.

05:28.702 --> 05:30.871
No notifications.

05:33.415 --> 05:36.168
-Uh, cheers to being single.

05:37.711 --> 05:40.047
What? Sorry, um...

05:40.048 --> 05:42.842
It's okay.
I like a woman who ignores me.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.705
Only in New York
could you make out

06:11.704 --> 06:14.373
in front of a bunch of garbage
and it's still romantic.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.910
They kissed
under the stars.

06:50.910 --> 06:55.457
And after a perfectly crafted
follow-up text from Milo

06:55.456 --> 06:58.876
and an equally witty response
from Wendy,

06:58.877 --> 07:02.756
they would go weeks
before they ever spoke again.

07:07.302 --> 07:10.597
Three weeks and no signs
of un-ghosting later,

07:10.596 --> 07:14.600
Milo and his friend opted
to drink overpriced cocktails

07:14.600 --> 07:18.062
to celebrate someone
from college's best friend

07:18.062 --> 07:20.564
from high school's birthday.

07:20.564 --> 07:23.025
Did you hear about
this In-N-Out Burger

07:23.026 --> 07:25.070
that they found at a bus stop
in Jamaica, Queens?

07:25.069 --> 07:27.946
How did a cheeseburger
fly 3,000 miles?

07:27.947 --> 07:30.075
Yeah, that's fake.
That's a viral stunt.

07:30.074 --> 07:32.576
-That's not real.
-You serious?

07:32.576 --> 07:35.662
This is Hank Kadner,
Milo's best and most
put-together friend.

07:35.663 --> 07:38.208
He is a financial analyst
at JP Morgan

07:38.208 --> 07:41.378
who is as savvy
with his spreadsheets as he is
with his dating advice.

07:41.377 --> 07:44.296
-People will do
anything for clout.
-No, it's not fake.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.965
-Whoa.
-It was a pristine
In-N-Out Burger.

07:45.964 --> 07:47.257
Who's that?

07:49.259 --> 07:50.344
-No.
-Yeah.

07:50.345 --> 07:51.554
-Don't.
-That's it.

07:51.553 --> 07:54.139
I'm going to marry that woman.

07:54.139 --> 07:56.558
-You know, you always do this.
-Do what?

07:56.559 --> 07:58.895
You point at a girl
and you say, "I'm gonna
marry her."

07:58.894 --> 08:01.188
So, in the off chance you guys
do get married...

08:01.189 --> 08:03.108
at your wedding.
-...you can say you said that
-I don't sound like that.

08:03.108 --> 08:05.276
You look crazy.
Look, this is how you look.

08:05.276 --> 08:07.487
"I'm gonna marry her."

08:07.487 --> 08:09.489
-That's not what I sound like.
-That is exactly what
you sound like.

08:09.488 --> 08:12.157
-That's not
what I sound like at all.
-Hi.

08:12.951 --> 08:14.202
Can I help you?

08:14.952 --> 08:16.870
-Um, no--
-That's you.

08:16.870 --> 08:19.289
Why did you point at me?

08:19.290 --> 08:21.876
I was making a point.

08:21.875 --> 08:26.338
My friend here, he likes to--
he does this thing where he--

08:26.338 --> 08:28.132
he points
at the prettiest girl at the bar

08:28.132 --> 08:29.883
and he says,
"I'm gonna marry her."

08:29.884 --> 08:31.636
And in the off chance
that he happens

08:31.636 --> 08:33.638
to actually get married
to that girl,

08:33.638 --> 08:35.515
then he can say it
at the reception

08:35.514 --> 08:37.349
and it can be
like a cute moment.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.144
-He does it
in every bar we go to.
- Aw.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.352
-So it's kind of--
-Okay.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.731
So you think
I'm the cutest girl at this bar?

08:44.024 --> 08:47.110
I think that--
that's pretty fair to say.

08:47.110 --> 08:49.446
Ap spritzes on me.

08:49.446 --> 08:52.907
-Um, go talk to her.
-That'd be weird.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.326
-I'm not just gonna
go talk to her.
-Yeah, go.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.287
-What would I say?
-Oh, are you shy?

08:57.287 --> 09:00.957
"Uh, I'm shy.
I'm shy."

09:00.956 --> 09:02.791
That's me being shy.
How annoying is that?

09:02.792 --> 09:05.337
We don't have time for that.
Go talk to that girl!

09:05.336 --> 09:07.254
You said you're gonna marry her.
Now you won't even talk to her?

09:07.254 --> 09:09.840
Here's what you do you.
You go over, say "hi."

09:09.841 --> 09:11.801
-Touch her shoulder
a little bit.
-Okay.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.054
And then lean in,
say something funny.

09:14.053 --> 09:18.182
Maybe say it quietly
so she has to, like, lean in
towards you.

09:18.182 --> 09:20.851
-Okay.
-I had an ex who I thought
I was interesting for years.

09:20.851 --> 09:22.936
Turns out he just spoke
really quiet.

09:23.937 --> 09:25.314
That's cool.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.986
All right, I'll leave you to it.

09:32.279 --> 09:33.906
-What's up? Hey.
-Hi.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.451
-How you doing? I'm Milo.
-Hi.

09:36.451 --> 09:37.994
-Olivia.
-Olivia.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.704
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

09:39.703 --> 09:40.788
Where are you from?

09:40.788 --> 09:42.581
-I'm from Texas.
-Oh.

09:42.581 --> 09:44.124
A Southern belle.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.210
-Yeah, there we go.
-You're in the big city.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.505
Thank you, sir.
-Mm, you're welcome, ma'am.

09:48.504 --> 09:51.340
-Oh, my God,
we're doing accents.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.551
Help!
No, just kidding.

09:53.551 --> 09:57.055
No, I went to college
with, um, a friend of Lucy's

09:57.054 --> 09:59.264
who's also named Olivia.

09:59.264 --> 10:00.474
-Oh.
-Which is fun.

10:00.475 --> 10:02.435
-And-- what?

10:04.354 --> 10:06.648
Do you dress up
or you're like, "I don't do
costumes."

10:06.648 --> 10:08.942
-Um, I don't really... yeah.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.820
-Do costumes?
-I like to wear, like,
a fun hat.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.488
Just like a normal outfit,
fun hat.

10:13.488 --> 10:15.615
-I have a face for hats.
-Oh.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.492
It's so round.
Look how round it is.

10:17.491 --> 10:19.618
Just thought I'd come,
be a little, you know, wingman.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.287
-Oh, a wingman.
-Yeah.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.415
That's fun, interesting.
I like what you did there.

10:23.414 --> 10:25.290
One little wing, yeah.
Other wing holding him up.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.502
Yeah, he has really bad
social anxiety, so...

10:27.501 --> 10:28.877
-Oh, wow.
-...I try to help him out
with that.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.088
-Okay, that's intense.
-Yeah.

10:30.087 --> 10:31.755
-Touch it. Touch it.
-Can I?

10:31.755 --> 10:34.049
-I'm giving you permish.

10:34.049 --> 10:37.469
-It's soft, right?
You like that?
-Yeah, it's very soft.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.847
- Okay.
-Oh, wow.

10:38.846 --> 10:40.472
-Get the aromatics.
-Breathe it in.

10:40.472 --> 10:42.516
-Let the wine breathe.
-Wow, look at you go.

10:42.517 --> 10:46.312
-Stop-- look at our friends.
-Look at them over there.

10:46.312 --> 10:49.441
-Mmm, you are dying
to kiss my little mouth.
-Maybe I am.

10:49.441 --> 10:51.693
I don't have a top lip,
but I'm-- I can make it work.

10:51.692 --> 10:55.279
-What do you mean?
-I don't have a really big
top lip.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.448
That might be the best wine
I've ever tasted.

10:57.448 --> 10:58.949
Where did you get this?

10:58.950 --> 11:01.369
Uh, it's my boyfriend's family,
actually--

11:01.369 --> 11:03.079
My boyfriend's family.

11:03.078 --> 11:05.664
My boyfriend's...

11:05.664 --> 11:07.333
family
actually owns the vineyard

11:07.333 --> 11:12.046
that this is from,
and it's a rosé white wine.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.635
-What happened?
-Did you get her number, brah?

11:17.634 --> 11:20.012
-No. She actually has
a boyfriend.
- Oh.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.098
-How'd you find that out?
-I think I knew that.

11:22.097 --> 11:24.183
Oh, my-- thanks for telling me.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.727
Cheers for telling me
that she had a boyfriend.

11:26.727 --> 11:29.480
-Drama queen.
-Whoa.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.149
-Or king.
-Progressive.

11:32.149 --> 11:33.776
I don't wanna put you in a box.

11:33.777 --> 11:36.112
Yeah, drama king,
or drama prince over here.

11:36.111 --> 11:37.780
Okay, stop stealing my thunder.

11:37.780 --> 11:40.199
People should have to wear
these shirts

11:40.200 --> 11:42.077
that say "I'm single."

11:42.076 --> 11:43.494
Uh-huh.

11:43.495 --> 11:44.954
Because then it would help us,

11:44.953 --> 11:47.164
know who's single,
who's not single.

11:47.164 --> 11:49.875
So, you found out
she had a boyfriend,
then you just walked away?

11:49.875 --> 11:51.377
Yeah.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.796
-Serious?
-The conversation was done.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.422
-Hi.
-Oh, my God!

11:54.422 --> 11:56.049
-How are you doin'?
-Liv, how are you, babe?

11:56.048 --> 11:57.841
-I'm good.
-Good to see you.

11:57.841 --> 12:00.177
So you'll never guess
what this guy just did to me.

12:00.177 --> 12:03.389
He walked away because I said
I had a boyfriend.

12:03.389 --> 12:06.517
Uh, yes.
Yes, I did.

12:06.518 --> 12:09.145
Why would you do that?
We were having a conversation.

12:09.144 --> 12:11.188
We can be friends.

12:11.188 --> 12:12.648
I don't know if you guys
have heard

12:12.649 --> 12:14.734
of this word before-- friends.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.778
-Absolutely.
-I've heard of that too.

12:16.778 --> 12:18.405
I think that's
a very normal thing to do

12:18.404 --> 12:20.155
is to make friends.

12:20.155 --> 12:22.574
Theoretically, yes,
we can be friends,

12:22.575 --> 12:25.286
but we're in our 20s--
I'm sure you have your friends,

12:25.285 --> 12:27.246
I have my friends, I don't
really need more friends.

12:27.246 --> 12:30.749
I sort of need something
a little bit more serious.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.292
You're looking for a girlfriend?

12:32.293 --> 12:34.087
Not like a girlfriend,
girlfriend, but--

12:34.086 --> 12:36.714
Raise your hand if you're
looking for a girlfriend.

12:42.846 --> 12:44.305
We missed it.

12:51.812 --> 12:54.857
-That girl Jessie was cute.
-Yeah, she was really cute.

12:54.857 --> 12:57.484
-You guys seemed to hit it off.
-Yeah.

12:57.485 --> 12:59.696
-She gave me her number.
-Really?

12:59.696 --> 13:01.239
Are you gonna text her?

13:03.115 --> 13:05.034
-I think I'm gonna call her.
-What?

13:05.034 --> 13:07.327
-Yeah.
-You're joking.

13:07.327 --> 13:09.621
No. What are you doing?

13:09.621 --> 13:11.248
-You're joking. Hang up.
-What?

13:11.791 --> 13:13.835
- What are you doing?
-It's her voicemail.

13:13.835 --> 13:15.754
That's worse.
That is so much worse.

13:15.754 --> 13:18.131
Hi, Jessie.
Yeah, this is-- this is Hank.

13:18.130 --> 13:21.050
-Don't hang up, press one.
-We met tonight
at Jessie's party.

13:21.051 --> 13:23.053
-Press one, press one.
-Not Jessie's party.

13:23.052 --> 13:25.804
We met tonight at that party.
You told me to give you a call.

13:25.804 --> 13:27.931
-Erase it.
Pretend it was a butt dial.
-So, here I am.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.851
So let me know
if you'd like to hang out...

13:29.850 --> 13:31.810
-Do not hang up.
-...and get a drink sometime.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.730
-Okay. Bye.
-Press one, then three.

13:34.898 --> 13:36.900
-What's wrong with you?

13:36.899 --> 13:40.110
-What's wrong with you?
-Let me make a phone call.

13:40.110 --> 13:43.947
You just met
and you just left a voicemail
on this person's phone.

13:43.947 --> 13:45.741
Yeah, I mean business.

13:45.741 --> 13:49.036
-Is that okay?
-No, that's psychotic!

13:49.037 --> 13:52.457
I would not do that, personally.
That's not my ministry.

13:52.456 --> 13:56.919
I wouldn't personally do that,
but go ahead.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.545
It's not your ministry?

13:58.546 --> 14:00.423
Who are you, Joel Osteen?

14:00.423 --> 14:03.718
Leaving someone a voicemail--
that's not your ministry?

14:23.654 --> 14:26.907
Do you ever feel like New York
is talking to you?

14:35.332 --> 14:36.500
No.

14:43.549 --> 14:46.218
Days later,
in a different part
of Manhattan,

14:46.219 --> 14:49.681
Wendy and Jessie took
New York's most reliable
mode of transportation

14:49.681 --> 14:53.768
and floated the idea of never
having to be an ex again.

14:53.768 --> 14:56.021
-Look into my beautiful
green eyes.
-Okay.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.855
When someone says
they wanna date themself,

14:57.855 --> 15:00.399
there's always an ex, okay?

15:00.399 --> 15:03.068
Jessie Katz has been
Wendy's best friend

15:03.068 --> 15:06.030
since they met at Wesleyan
and both got dumped the day
before graduation.

15:06.030 --> 15:09.366
They were bound
by their singlehood and love
of New York.

15:09.366 --> 15:11.827
Sometimes it's us,
sometimes it's them,

15:11.827 --> 15:14.788
but behind
every disappearing person,
there's an ex.

15:14.788 --> 15:18.876
-Trust me.
-No, I hate that.
I don't like exes.

15:18.876 --> 15:22.004
I don't like being an ex,
I don't like talking about exes,
and it stresses me out.

15:22.004 --> 15:24.465
When someone brings up their ex,
they're just tryin' to show you

15:24.466 --> 15:26.259
that they were once
a hot commodity.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.136
-Exactly.
-So I should like them
even more,

15:28.135 --> 15:30.471
because they have
a series of exes.

15:30.471 --> 15:33.349
-Speaking of people you like,
what is going on with--

15:33.350 --> 15:36.895
It was at this point
that the nosy app Meet Cute

15:36.894 --> 15:39.021
reminded Wendy
of her date with Milo

15:39.022 --> 15:42.942
and gave her an idea
of how to never be an ex again.

15:46.779 --> 15:50.407
Meanwhile, bored and alone
on the Upper West Side,

15:50.408 --> 15:52.869
Milo is catching up
on his stories.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.788
Instagram stories.

15:54.788 --> 15:58.124
- Wait, is that Jessie?

16:09.510 --> 16:11.303
Until all of a sudden...

16:25.985 --> 16:28.196
Unknowing
of what was to come,

16:28.196 --> 16:30.949
Milo met Wendy
at a neutral diner

16:30.948 --> 16:33.492
placed equidistant
along the F train.

16:35.953 --> 16:38.122
So, what do you think?

16:38.123 --> 16:39.791
Nope.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.459
No, I'm not.

16:41.458 --> 16:43.002
I don't think so.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.796
No, because I'm just gonna
fall in love,

16:44.796 --> 16:46.923
I'm gonna get my heart broken,
and then you see

16:46.923 --> 16:48.758
how that could be
very bad for me.

16:48.758 --> 16:52.178
-No.
-You use that word so loosely--
fall in love.

16:52.177 --> 16:53.804
You literally said
you were gonna fall in love

16:53.804 --> 16:55.681
with the girl we saw
with the New Yorker bag.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.017
Okay, but did you see her,
though?

16:57.017 --> 16:58.435
Anyway, where were we?

16:58.434 --> 17:00.144
-We were, uh--
-Oh, my God!

17:00.144 --> 17:01.895
We were acknowledging the fact

17:01.895 --> 17:04.522
that we are both mutually
heartbroken people

17:04.522 --> 17:06.400
who want all the benefits
of a relationship

17:06.401 --> 17:08.778
without the miserable torture
of actually being in one.

17:08.778 --> 17:10.155
Wendy, a couple hours ago,

17:10.154 --> 17:11.864
I thought that you were
ghosting me.

17:11.865 --> 17:13.199
I was ready to cut you
out of my life,

17:13.199 --> 17:15.743
forget about you, move,
honestly.

17:15.742 --> 17:18.119
Then you text me
out of nowhere,

17:18.121 --> 17:20.707
"Hey, we need to talk.
It's very important."

17:20.707 --> 17:22.375
All lowercase.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.877
You can understand
how I'm freaking out, right?

17:23.876 --> 17:26.127
I'm like, "She's pregnant.
She's pregnant."

17:26.127 --> 17:29.798
And if you are pregnant,
then I'm ready.

17:29.798 --> 17:32.259
Um, we used,
like, so many condoms,
I wouldn't be worried.

17:32.259 --> 17:35.054
-Thank God you're not pregnant.
-Oh, man, I know, I know.

17:35.055 --> 17:39.059
-Wouldn't that be terrible?
-Whoo! I was freaking out.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.393
-Like, I said I was ready;
I'm not ready.
-Rewinding.

17:41.394 --> 17:44.647
Do you not want consistent sex
without the emotional
attachment?

17:44.646 --> 17:47.399
Okay, no, I do want
consistent sex, I want that,

17:47.400 --> 17:49.819
but I also want
the emotional attachment.

17:49.818 --> 17:51.362
Okay, how about this?

17:51.363 --> 17:53.573
We could be each other's
guides, Milo, right?

17:53.573 --> 17:55.283
Like you guide me, I guide you.

17:55.282 --> 17:57.826
I could teach you
how to not be ghosted.

17:57.826 --> 18:01.038
I look like I get ghosted?

18:01.038 --> 18:02.122
-Yeah.
-Me?

18:02.123 --> 18:04.542
-Mm-hmm.
-No. I ghost.

18:04.541 --> 18:06.043
-I don't get ghosted.
-Oh.

18:06.044 --> 18:08.380
You maybe look like
you could use help

18:08.380 --> 18:10.548
not dating douche bags.

18:10.548 --> 18:12.884
I don't think that men
are as complicated
as you want us to be.

18:12.884 --> 18:15.387
You're playing chess,
we're playing Xbox.

18:15.386 --> 18:18.222
-What?
-You're playing chess,
we're playing Nintendo 64.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.808
-Who?

18:20.808 --> 18:22.101
Boom.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.815
You've never blown a cartridge?

18:26.815 --> 18:28.650
I'm sitting here,
I'm listening to you,

18:28.650 --> 18:31.236
I'm thinking, and, you know,
you seem like a sweet guy.

18:31.236 --> 18:33.029
You seem like
a really, really nice guy,

18:33.028 --> 18:35.823
but I'm thinking that this is
just maybe a bad idea,

18:35.824 --> 18:38.118
'cause I'm just being selfish,
I'm just being selfish.

18:38.117 --> 18:41.203
I'm projecting my own fears,
and I don't wanna take
advantage of you.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.997
I mean, you're a nice dude
and, you know, it's stupid.

18:43.998 --> 18:46.835
So, we should probably just
sit here, enjoy this meal.

19:04.685 --> 19:07.229
Okay, all right, after some
non-awkward silence--

19:07.230 --> 19:09.524
Ah! You've come to your senses.
I am so glad!

19:09.523 --> 19:10.774
Okay, let's talk terms.

19:11.108 --> 19:15.738
Lucky for you, I come up
with this little gem.

19:15.739 --> 19:18.700
This was Wendy's solution
to any future heartbreaks,

19:18.700 --> 19:23.288
because you can't get dumped
if you were never in a real
relationship, right?

19:26.207 --> 19:28.877
Here's the brass tacks--
basically, we don't get jealous
of each other.

19:28.876 --> 19:31.628
And for every night that I spend
at your place, you spend
two nights at mine.

19:31.628 --> 19:33.297
-How is that fair?
-You live with your parents.

19:33.298 --> 19:35.884
I don't.
I live with my mom and Larry.

19:35.884 --> 19:38.928
And they travel a lot,
so I'm being financially
responsible.

19:44.351 --> 19:46.102
I'm not even gonna consider
signing that

19:46.102 --> 19:48.646
until you add cuddling.

19:48.645 --> 19:50.522
-Add cuddling?
-Yup.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.608
And none
of that on opposite sides
of the bed stuff.

19:52.608 --> 19:57.654
I need, boom, 75% of the night
together, at least. At least.

19:57.654 --> 20:00.616
Separation, that makes me
think of divorce.

20:00.616 --> 20:03.202
-I don't like it.
-Most marriages
end in divorce anyway.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.286
No deal.

20:07.539 --> 20:10.417
Fine!
Fine, you can have cuddling.

20:10.417 --> 20:12.670
♪ We're gonna cuddle
I'ma be big spoon ♪

20:12.671 --> 20:16.007
♪ Sometimes little spoon
'Cause I like feelin' safe ♪

20:16.007 --> 20:18.385
-♪ What? ♪
-You have a nice voice
and we can sing later.

20:18.384 --> 20:19.843
You have to ad lib.

20:19.844 --> 20:21.596
-♪ What? ♪
-I don't know.

20:21.596 --> 20:24.349
-Okay, go on, go on, go on. Go.
-Okay, one more thing.

20:24.348 --> 20:25.933
-This is very important.
-Mm-hmm.

20:25.933 --> 20:28.394
The words "I love you,"
in that order,

20:28.394 --> 20:31.355
cannot be shared with one party
to the other

20:31.355 --> 20:33.440
unless they are used
in a non-affectionate way.

20:33.441 --> 20:35.318
What does this mean?
Let me explain it to you.

20:35.317 --> 20:37.111
Any example of that exemption
would be

20:37.112 --> 20:38.905
if we were to impersonate
someone

20:38.904 --> 20:42.157
or if we use it in a sarcastic
and/or educational

20:42.157 --> 20:44.201
and/or non-truthful tone.

20:44.201 --> 20:46.578
Does that make sense?

20:46.578 --> 20:48.831
-Okay.
-We shake.

20:48.832 --> 20:51.418
And so,
once upon a time,
in New York City,

20:51.417 --> 20:55.421
Milo and Wendy's non-love story
finally began.

20:55.422 --> 20:58.466
-Everything was perfect.

20:59.384 --> 21:02.053
This is going to end
with one of you guys
getting your heart broken.

21:02.053 --> 21:04.097
No, we're not, because
we're being really open

21:04.096 --> 21:05.556
and transparent
about the whole thing.

21:05.557 --> 21:07.100
We're not playing any games.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.476
Okay, but in the entire history
of romance,

21:09.477 --> 21:13.231
whenever two people start
sleeping together, like,
it gets complicated.

21:13.230 --> 21:16.650
That's why we did the contract,
so we know what we can
and cannot do.

21:16.651 --> 21:18.987
We set boundaries, so no one's
heart's getting broken.

21:18.987 --> 21:22.490
Yeah, the contract
that establishes you guys
as friends with benefits?

21:22.490 --> 21:24.409
Oh...

21:24.409 --> 21:26.453
This is going to end poorly
for you, my friend.

21:26.452 --> 21:29.038
Look, it's not like
we were friends, you know,

21:29.038 --> 21:30.622
and then we started
sleeping together,

21:30.623 --> 21:32.334
and now we're reverting back
to friendship.

21:32.334 --> 21:34.919
It's like, you know,
we started with sex,

21:34.919 --> 21:37.255
and now we're turning that
into a very beautiful

21:37.255 --> 21:40.717
and respectful friendship
with sex.

21:40.717 --> 21:42.552
Here's where I think
it's gonna go, okay?

21:42.551 --> 21:45.387
Act one, inciting incident--
you sign the contract.

21:45.387 --> 21:47.973
You're laughing, laughing,
laughing, having amazing sex.

21:47.973 --> 21:50.309
Congratulations.
Having the time of your life.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.852
You start to get
some inside jokes.

21:51.853 --> 21:53.688
"I'm hilarious."

21:53.688 --> 21:55.440
That's my impression of you
in this fun relationship.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.192
Act two-- fun and games.

21:57.192 --> 21:59.235
You guys start to have
the perks of a relationship

21:59.234 --> 22:01.612
without actually having to deal
with being in a relationship,

22:01.613 --> 22:04.908
because being in a relationship
is famously hell on Earth.

22:04.907 --> 22:07.534
And then act three--
one of you randomly decides

22:07.535 --> 22:09.412
you do actually want to be
in a relationship...

22:09.412 --> 22:11.664
And then, yeah, boom,
movie's done.

22:11.663 --> 22:13.624
I don't believe in traditional
three-act structure.

22:13.625 --> 22:15.584
Not every movie
needs three acts.

22:15.585 --> 22:18.421
Some are just one honeymoon act.

22:18.421 --> 22:20.590
It's kind of risk-free
and there's ultimately--

22:20.589 --> 22:23.050
it's just like me wearing
the pants, which is kinda nice.

22:23.050 --> 22:24.468
But does he know that?

22:24.469 --> 22:26.471
Plus, I think
she's as in love with me

22:26.471 --> 22:30.475
as I am with her,
so it's gonna work out.

22:33.103 --> 22:35.355
And the friends
that I was talking about,

22:35.355 --> 22:41.236
they got back together
and, uh, were confused.

22:41.236 --> 22:43.655
They were confused as to why
they got back together.

22:43.654 --> 22:45.781
And they were like,
"Oh, we don't know

22:45.781 --> 22:48.117
how we got back together
after all this time."

22:48.117 --> 22:49.535
They were apart three years.

22:49.536 --> 22:51.246
They weren't together
for three years.

22:51.246 --> 22:53.998
They get back together, and then
they're asking me like,

22:53.998 --> 22:56.751
"What do you think it was?"
I'm like, "I know what it was.

22:56.750 --> 22:59.044
It was roll-over feelings.

23:00.672 --> 23:02.549
Which is when
you're in a relationship,

23:02.548 --> 23:05.634
you got feelings, you got
the relationship planned,

23:05.634 --> 23:08.470
hoping it's gonna be
a family plan, right?

23:09.263 --> 23:13.308
Then you break up, but then
you get back together

23:13.308 --> 23:16.729
with those same minutes
from that phone

23:16.730 --> 23:18.732
and it's like same phone.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.149
Who this?

23:20.150 --> 23:24.446
Whoo! Amazing!

23:24.445 --> 23:27.865
-I think I'm gonna marry her.
- Because she laughed
at your jokes?

23:27.865 --> 23:29.742
I don't think her mom
likes me, though.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.910
- You met her mom?
-Yeah, accidentally.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.413
- How?
-Bloomie's.

23:33.413 --> 23:35.331
What were you doing
at Bloomingdale's?

23:35.330 --> 23:37.833
-I was getting free cologne.
-You're stealing cologne now?

23:37.834 --> 23:39.669
No, you just walk in,

23:39.669 --> 23:42.213
and then you
get your free sample,
and then you go.

23:42.212 --> 23:45.257
-Anyway, I see Wendy's mom.
-Wait, Wendy wasn't there?

23:45.258 --> 23:47.469
No, but I recognize her mom
from her Instagram.

23:47.469 --> 23:49.512
-Cool.
-So, I go over to say hello.

23:49.511 --> 23:51.764
So I walk up to her
and I'm like, "Oh, hello."

23:51.765 --> 23:53.975
And then she's like,
"Uh, who are you?"

23:53.974 --> 23:56.185
I'm like, "Oh, sorry,
sorry, sorry, I'm Milo.

23:56.185 --> 23:59.146
I met Wendy on a dating app
and we're sort of friends now.

23:59.146 --> 24:00.647
You're Wendy's mom, right?"

24:00.647 --> 24:02.191
She's like,
"Yeah, yeah, indeed I am.

24:02.192 --> 24:04.694
I don't know who you are."

24:04.693 --> 24:06.570
She didn't know who I was.

24:06.570 --> 24:11.241
So that either means that A,
Wendy did tell her about me

24:11.241 --> 24:14.286
and she doesn't like me,
so she's trying to neg me

24:14.287 --> 24:16.122
by acting like
she doesn't know who I am

24:16.122 --> 24:21.836
or Wendy didn't tell her,
because she takes me as a joke.

24:21.836 --> 24:24.839
-Wait, do we care
what Wendy's mom thinks?
-Yes.

24:24.838 --> 24:28.592
I mean, I want Wendy to like me,
so I want her mom to like me.

24:28.593 --> 24:32.430
Okay, never underestimate
the will of a girl

24:32.430 --> 24:35.600
to disrespect
her parents' wishes, okay?

24:35.599 --> 24:37.393
Make sure you get my T-zone.

24:37.394 --> 24:39.145
I've been told it's very oily.

24:39.144 --> 24:41.897
Ooh, did I tell you
that I broke up with Katie 7F?

24:41.897 --> 24:44.608
What? I didn't even know
that you were dating her.

24:44.608 --> 24:46.527
You're already breaking up
with her?

24:46.528 --> 24:48.905
Katie 7F
grew up on the seventh floor

24:48.904 --> 24:51.448
in apartment letter F
in Milo's building.

24:51.449 --> 24:54.786
They rediscovered
each other sexually
after a romantic elevator ride

24:54.786 --> 24:58.206
wherein Milo AirDropped
his phone number to her phone,

24:58.205 --> 24:59.665
by mistake, of course.

25:06.338 --> 25:10.092
- That's a good one,
yeah.

25:10.093 --> 25:12.095
Is that gonna make it
to your Instagram?

25:12.095 --> 25:13.722
What?

25:13.721 --> 25:16.682
Is it just gonna make it
to your grid?

25:16.682 --> 25:18.976
'Cause I'm usually
in your story, which is dope,

25:18.977 --> 25:21.563
love that, just hoping that,
you know,

25:21.563 --> 25:25.025
maybe we can make
the next step, go to the grid.

25:25.025 --> 25:26.401
What do you mean?

25:26.401 --> 25:29.821
I've posted you
on Instagram before.

25:29.820 --> 25:32.031
-No, you haven't.
-Yes, I have!

25:32.031 --> 25:35.909
That one time we were in Maine
at that ice cream store,
Scoop Du Jour.

25:35.910 --> 25:37.454
We had mousse vanilla.

25:37.453 --> 25:39.496
I remember you posted
the ice cream cone

25:39.497 --> 25:41.708
and then you tagged me

25:41.708 --> 25:43.084
in the photo
of the ice cream cone.

25:43.084 --> 25:45.587
No, your name was in the photo.

25:45.586 --> 25:48.047
Okay, that's not my face,
though,

25:48.048 --> 25:50.175
that's my Instagram handle.

25:51.384 --> 25:53.678
Well, what do you mean?

25:53.678 --> 25:56.306
People are gonna be like,
"Oh, he made that ice cream
for her."

25:56.306 --> 26:00.602
I didn't. I was there,
took the train up with you.

26:00.602 --> 26:02.687
-Do you not get that?
-Yes.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.438
-You do get that?
-I--

26:04.439 --> 26:05.690
So you know,
but you're just ashamed.

26:06.316 --> 26:07.984
No, it was on my Instagram.
I don't understand the problem.

26:08.734 --> 26:10.152
-We should break up.
-Serious?

26:10.153 --> 26:12.364
Yeah!
I think we should break up.

26:12.364 --> 26:14.866
-Actions speak
louder than captions!
-Please stop yelling at me!

26:14.865 --> 26:18.285
It's really nice,
because I realize
the role that I play

26:18.286 --> 26:21.873
is I'm sort of like this
between-relationship doula
for women.

26:21.873 --> 26:23.583
Am I not present with you
right now?

26:23.583 --> 26:25.126
You're screaming at me
in the middle of the park!

26:25.125 --> 26:26.710
-I'm not screaming at you!
-Yes, you are!

26:26.711 --> 26:28.254
No, I was tryin' to have
a conversation with you!

26:28.253 --> 26:29.880
This is so embarrassing!

26:29.881 --> 26:31.758
So they could go
from, like, one guy,

26:31.758 --> 26:33.718
improve themselves, and then
go on to the next guy.

26:33.718 --> 26:36.179
I'm sort of like a manic pixie
dream boy in that way.

26:36.179 --> 26:37.931
I think we need to just break up
with each other.

26:37.931 --> 26:39.599
-What?
-I think it's over.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.850
You're obsessed with Instagram,
with social media.

26:41.851 --> 26:43.770
I'm not obsessed.

26:43.769 --> 26:45.646
You have a sick obsession with
how people think about you.

26:45.646 --> 26:46.980
What are you talking about?

26:46.980 --> 26:48.399
It's like, "Damn,
you're awesome,

26:48.692 --> 26:51.403
but Wendy, she's uh--
she's the one, you know?"

26:51.403 --> 26:52.904
-Right...
-Or at least I think.

26:52.903 --> 26:54.196
-I don't know.
-Yeah.

26:54.196 --> 26:56.281
So, it's over,

26:56.281 --> 26:58.450
because she wouldn't post
a picture of you two?

26:58.451 --> 26:59.577
Yeah.

26:59.576 --> 27:01.161
I think that she was embarrassed

27:01.162 --> 27:03.039
to have people know
that we were dating.

27:03.038 --> 27:04.748
-Hmm.
-I know.

27:04.749 --> 27:07.544
So I had to break up with her.
Had to do it.

27:07.544 --> 27:09.963
Oh, don't be rude
to my friend Milo.

27:09.962 --> 27:12.673
Oh. Yeah... I don't know.

27:12.673 --> 27:15.551
Over before it started,
on to the next one,

27:15.551 --> 27:17.970
which is the name
of my dating podcast,
by the way.

27:17.971 --> 27:20.807
-The one
you haven't started yet?
-We're looking for guests.

27:20.807 --> 27:22.642
I don't know
if it's about dating yet.

27:22.642 --> 27:24.185
It might just be about life,
but if you wanna come on,

27:24.184 --> 27:25.436
talk about any guys
that you're dating,

27:25.436 --> 27:27.521
that you might really like.

27:27.521 --> 27:29.690
If it is,
can you talk about people
who break up with you,

27:29.691 --> 27:31.401
and then still follow you
on Instagram,

27:31.401 --> 27:33.361
and like all your photos
and your pictures?

27:33.361 --> 27:35.280
Orbiters.
They're orbiting you.

27:35.279 --> 27:38.032
-What do they do?
-They're orbiting, you know,
like...

27:38.032 --> 27:39.825
Oh, my God, you're gonna poke
my eye out!

27:39.826 --> 27:42.078
-Stop, stop.
I get it, I get it.
-Okay, whoa.

27:42.077 --> 27:44.788
All right, but there was
this New York Times article
that I sent you.

27:44.788 --> 27:47.041
I don't read any of the articles
that you send me.

27:47.041 --> 27:49.501
-You never read any of the
articles that I send you?
-Who has time?

27:49.501 --> 27:51.378
-You know what really does
annoy me, though?
-Hmm?

27:51.378 --> 27:53.839
I hate it when someone
posts something

27:53.839 --> 27:56.133
and you can really tell
that they're trying

27:56.134 --> 27:59.012
-to get under your skin,
you know?
-Mm-hmm.

27:59.011 --> 28:02.639
They'll post something
at a place that was special
to the both of you.

28:02.640 --> 28:05.352
And then it's like,
"Oh, who's this new person?

28:05.352 --> 28:07.145
They just invited
some new person."

28:07.144 --> 28:09.688
-Yep.
-And they're
at Shakespeare in the Park

28:09.689 --> 28:13.401
and they're
just having a great time
at Shakespeare in the Park

28:13.401 --> 28:15.528
with some guy probably named
Greg or something,

28:15.528 --> 28:17.447
who works in finance
and is a loser.

28:17.446 --> 28:21.784
That is honestly called
"targeted offensive orbiting,"

28:21.785 --> 28:23.536
and it is a serious problem.

28:23.536 --> 28:26.122
It's like a lighthouse
in the deep, dark sea of emotion

28:26.122 --> 28:27.832
that's tryin' to get the boat
back to the dock.

28:27.832 --> 28:30.210
It's literally someone going,
"Hey, look at me.

28:30.210 --> 28:32.253
I'm recreating this experience
that we had together

28:32.252 --> 28:34.546
with someone else,
and I am happier doing it.

28:34.547 --> 28:36.091
Ha ha ha ha ha."

28:36.090 --> 28:37.966
It's like a foghorn.

28:37.967 --> 28:40.595
-It's...
- Foghorning! Yes!

28:40.595 --> 28:42.681
-Okay, that was good.
-Oh, my God, okay.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.774
I need some time.

28:53.775 --> 28:56.069
-I'm almost ready,
I'm almost ready.
-Silence is boring.

28:56.068 --> 28:59.029
Shh, hurry up.
Are you ready?

28:59.029 --> 29:00.739
I'm ready.
What are your thoughts?

29:00.740 --> 29:04.577
I thought that was funny,
but it could be shorter.

29:04.576 --> 29:06.120
I thought it was really long.

29:06.121 --> 29:08.373
But it was funny, though.
It was funny.

29:08.373 --> 29:10.083
Okay, okay.

29:10.083 --> 29:14.421
I am still trying to figure out
what the movie's about.

29:14.421 --> 29:16.464
Does it have to be
about something?

29:16.463 --> 29:18.841
It's about a dude
that turns into a dog.

29:18.842 --> 29:21.344
I'm trying to think
of what the movie's
trying to say,

29:21.344 --> 29:23.847
because that's
just such a basic plot point.

29:23.846 --> 29:25.347
A guy turning into a dog?

29:25.347 --> 29:26.974
It's saying that,
wow, isn't it crazy

29:26.974 --> 29:28.517
when someone turns into a dog?

29:28.518 --> 29:30.228
I feel like
that's what they're saying.

29:30.228 --> 29:31.855
No, art is art because
it lets us feel something.

29:31.855 --> 29:33.231
Here's my gist.

29:33.230 --> 29:34.815
I think it's about parenthood

29:34.816 --> 29:36.568
and how it's difficult
to raise a child,

29:36.567 --> 29:38.402
because we really take advantage
of the little moments

29:38.403 --> 29:41.573
and how we need to savor life
a little bit more.

29:41.573 --> 29:43.324
That's just off the top
of my head.

29:43.324 --> 29:44.909
-I need more time to think.
-That was smart.

29:44.909 --> 29:46.703
-Thank you.
-You're making me a cinephile.

29:46.702 --> 29:48.662
-I know.
-That was good.

29:48.663 --> 29:50.832
What if we were a movie?
What would our movie be?

29:50.832 --> 29:55.086
Oh, my God,
I think it would be like
a slasher horror film

29:55.086 --> 29:56.755
where Denzel Washington
plays you

29:56.755 --> 29:58.381
-and Margot Robbie plays me.
-Okay.

29:58.381 --> 30:00.425
And we both get gutted
and die together.

30:00.424 --> 30:02.051
And then we have to solve
our own murders.

30:02.051 --> 30:03.510
And then we come alive
in different universes

30:03.510 --> 30:05.137
and solve who murdered
each of us.

30:05.137 --> 30:07.264
I like the different universe
aspect of it.

30:07.265 --> 30:09.100
-That's nice.
-Yeah, and then we-- exactly.

30:09.099 --> 30:11.560
And then we, and then we,
and then we.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.103
-Stop, stop, stop!
-And then we--

30:13.104 --> 30:15.857
-Clever, but, no.
-No? No hand holding?

30:15.856 --> 30:18.108
Why? No!
Do you want my social too?

30:18.108 --> 30:20.110
-Yeah, that'd be nice.
-I'll give you all my
credit card numbers.

30:20.111 --> 30:23.198
Honestly, I would love that.
You pay for dinner anyway, so.

30:23.198 --> 30:24.324
-That's true.

30:25.157 --> 30:28.369
So what about holding hands
makes you uncomfortable?

30:28.369 --> 30:30.371
That's Milo's doorman Cole.

30:30.372 --> 30:33.124
I hear he's a really handsome
and charming guy.

30:33.124 --> 30:35.794
-Well, he's not my boyfriend,
so why would he hold my hand?
-Right.

30:35.794 --> 30:38.505
-Can you guys go on dates
with other people?
- Duh.

30:38.505 --> 30:39.964
-That's the whole point.
-Why not?

30:39.963 --> 30:41.173
Who pays for dinner?

30:41.173 --> 30:42.508
-She does.
-We split it.

30:42.509 --> 30:44.803
-Hmm, no.
-Excuse me?

30:44.803 --> 30:46.471
-You do.

30:46.471 --> 30:48.640
I literally have sent you,
like, 50 Venmo requests,

30:48.640 --> 30:51.893
and they're all sitting there,
and I am being a gentle woman

30:51.893 --> 30:53.895
by not reminding you
that they are there.

30:53.894 --> 30:58.982
Okay, I got one more
very, very important question.

31:03.113 --> 31:04.364
Hang on.

31:04.364 --> 31:05.365
Hi.

31:06.615 --> 31:08.701
Sorry about that.
Uh, who are you here to see?

31:08.701 --> 31:10.619
-7F? What's your name?
-Brian.

31:10.619 --> 31:13.664
-Brian, all right.
-Okay, he's also totally lying

31:13.664 --> 31:15.874
-about not telling
people's business.
-Oh, my God.

31:15.875 --> 31:19.379
He was the person
that told me my parents
were having an affair.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.046
-Stop!
-Yeah.

31:21.047 --> 31:23.299
-That's unreal.
-I know.

31:23.298 --> 31:25.843
-I'm sorry!
-It's totally unreal because
I'm just messing with you.

31:25.844 --> 31:27.387
-That didn't really happen.
-Are you kidding?

31:27.386 --> 31:30.180
Sorry about that.
Where were we?

31:30.181 --> 31:31.599
Important question.
Ready?

31:35.060 --> 31:39.898
What happens when one of you
catches feelings?

31:39.898 --> 31:43.694
Uh, you mean if one of us
catches feelings?

31:49.742 --> 31:52.828
Yeah, yeah, if.

31:52.828 --> 31:56.248
No, no, I mean when.

31:56.249 --> 31:58.668
It's never if.

31:58.667 --> 31:59.835
It's never, ever if.

31:59.836 --> 32:02.589
It's-- it's always when.

32:06.259 --> 32:08.636
You guys are gonna have
a lot of fun...

32:10.512 --> 32:12.556
but it's never gonna work out.

32:14.558 --> 32:16.393
Take it from me.

32:27.364 --> 32:28.782
Sweet and salty.

32:30.115 --> 32:31.241
How's that?

32:32.826 --> 32:34.119
Hmm.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.624
How about the Razzle Dazzle?

32:38.625 --> 32:40.292
Does it razzle?

32:40.292 --> 32:41.460
Does it...

32:42.420 --> 32:43.630
Dazzle?

32:45.089 --> 32:46.799
All right, that's it.

32:48.259 --> 32:50.303
-No. It's not.
-No. Okay.

32:50.303 --> 32:52.138
Well, at least
you're predictable.

32:52.137 --> 32:53.472
Huh?

32:53.472 --> 32:54.640
Cookie dough.

32:54.641 --> 32:56.059
Why would you say that?

32:56.058 --> 32:57.518
Well, you just gotta
pick a flavor

32:57.519 --> 32:59.437
and then just go
with that flavor.

32:59.436 --> 33:01.689
And why would I pick a flavor
and just go with that flavor

33:01.690 --> 33:03.024
when I can try all the flavors?

33:03.023 --> 33:04.566
Because if you try
all the flavors,

33:04.567 --> 33:06.361
then you never really get
to experience

33:06.361 --> 33:12.200
just one good flavor at once.

33:12.200 --> 33:14.953
- Let me
think about that.
-Mm-hmm, yeah.

33:14.952 --> 33:17.371
Yeah, I think I'm just gonna
exercise my right

33:17.372 --> 33:20.542
-to try all the flavors
because I can.
-Okay.

33:20.541 --> 33:22.501
And I'm going to get
the vanilla cone.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.586
- Boring. Predictable.
-That's not boring.

33:24.586 --> 33:27.464
No, I like vanilla,
because I'm traveled, I'm wise,

33:27.464 --> 33:29.341
I'm cultured,
I've had the other flavors.

33:29.342 --> 33:31.761
Chocolate varies too much
brand to brand.

33:31.760 --> 33:34.263
-Cotton candy, that's one
of the fun flavors, right?
-Yeah.

33:34.263 --> 33:36.348
You take two bites of that,
too sweet.

33:36.348 --> 33:37.766
Thank you.

33:37.767 --> 33:39.894
-It's melting and everything.
-Cheers.

33:41.438 --> 33:45.066
Okay, well, I guess
you'll never experience the joy

33:45.066 --> 33:48.236
of having a Razzle Dazzle,
salted caramel,

33:48.236 --> 33:52.449
-and cookie dough,
in a cup, please.
- Okay.

33:52.449 --> 33:55.660
I guess
you'll never experience the joy
of committing to something.

34:00.664 --> 34:04.168
What are you guys
really talking about?

34:04.169 --> 34:05.920
Just some metaphors.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.964
Yeah, metaphors are great ways
to talk about things

34:07.963 --> 34:10.757
-that you don't actually
wanna talk about.
-Mm-hmm.

34:14.179 --> 34:17.014
Do-- do you wanna check out?

34:17.014 --> 34:19.975
Three avoided "what are we"
conversations later,

34:19.976 --> 34:24.022
Milo wished he was the flavor
that could make Wendy happy.

34:24.021 --> 34:26.607
-I think you make me
a better person.

34:26.608 --> 34:29.694
I'm literally the same person
you've dated your entire life,

34:29.693 --> 34:32.571
and if you're really
on the quest to look
for the one,

34:32.572 --> 34:35.116
then you really have to stop
looking in the same place.

34:35.114 --> 34:36.867
I think you need to give
yourself more credit.

34:36.867 --> 34:38.494
You don't make me
a better person.

34:38.494 --> 34:40.120
That's why this works so well.

34:40.121 --> 34:42.165
We're like the TV show
you watch every night,

34:42.164 --> 34:44.667
that episode of The Office
that you know line by line.

34:44.668 --> 34:46.585
You just know what to expect.

34:47.460 --> 34:48.587
What's wrong with that?

34:48.588 --> 34:50.255
Okay!

34:51.925 --> 34:53.967
Hook, Hook, Hook.
Wait, wait, wait.

34:53.967 --> 34:57.638
Um, no, I know--
stop, I know who is in Hook.

34:57.639 --> 34:59.766
-Rufio.
-Whoa!

34:59.766 --> 35:01.976
-Um, yes, that's his na--
-Has a name.

35:01.976 --> 35:03.603
Okay, calm down.

35:03.603 --> 35:05.438
Uh, his name is, uh...

35:05.438 --> 35:06.606
- Three...
-Two...

35:07.440 --> 35:08.858
No, wait,
no, no, no, stop!

35:08.858 --> 35:10.777
-...one.
-Stop!

35:10.777 --> 35:14.239
Chug, chug, chug, chug!

35:14.239 --> 35:15.532
-Chug it, chug it.
-That's alcohol.

35:15.532 --> 35:17.242
-No more.

35:17.242 --> 35:20.495
- Oh, Dante Basco, duh.
-Should we split it?

35:20.494 --> 35:23.414
-No, I think we should
do individually.
-Why?

35:23.414 --> 35:26.458
-That's, like,
extremely difficult...
-Hank had two mains.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.002
He did, didn't he?

35:28.003 --> 35:30.005
Yeah, I'm bulking.

35:30.005 --> 35:31.715
You ate like two people.

35:31.715 --> 35:34.175
You got the sea bass
and you got a hanger steak.

35:34.175 --> 35:38.013
But that hanger steak
was not for the table,
that was for you.

35:38.012 --> 35:40.681
Okay, fine, I'll--
I will pay the tip.

35:40.681 --> 35:42.307
-Okay.
-Okay.

35:42.307 --> 35:44.560
-Aw! You guys!
- Settled. That's fair.

35:44.561 --> 35:47.063
Say "Thank you, Daddy" on three.
One, two, three.

35:47.063 --> 35:49.107
-Thank you, Daddy.
- Very good.

35:49.106 --> 35:50.774
-Why didn't you say it?
-'Cause it's uncomfortable.

35:50.775 --> 35:52.944
-I always tell them that.
-He liked that too much.

35:52.943 --> 35:56.405
Now that that's settled,
Wendy has big news,
speaking of news.

35:56.405 --> 36:00.075
-Oh, does she?
-Wendy is moving to LA.

36:00.076 --> 36:01.870
She's movin' to LA.
She just told me.

36:01.869 --> 36:03.996
-That's exciting,
that's awesome.
- No...

36:03.996 --> 36:06.123
-I-- what?
-I'm-- I'm just...

36:07.291 --> 36:10.377
contemplating a life there...

36:10.378 --> 36:12.297
Like, on purpose?

36:12.297 --> 36:13.798
Hate that for you.

36:13.797 --> 36:16.633
-LA is a haunted house...
-Oh, my God.

36:16.634 --> 36:18.887
...full of cardboard
sunshine people.

36:18.887 --> 36:20.472
Why did you do that?
See, you've made her mad.

36:20.472 --> 36:22.891
-You're being a child.
-I'm not being a child.

36:22.891 --> 36:24.601
-You're being a child.
-Mm-mm.

36:24.601 --> 36:26.061
You look like a child right now.

36:26.061 --> 36:28.229
The way you're drinking
is childlike.

36:28.228 --> 36:31.732
If they're not a couple,
they're definitely fighting
like a couple.

36:31.733 --> 36:34.194
-Well, they are.
-I don't think--
that was bickering.

36:34.193 --> 36:36.236
-I don't think
that was fighting.
-It wasn't fighting.

36:36.237 --> 36:37.822
You were being kind of dramatic.
That wasn't fighting.

36:37.822 --> 36:39.783
That was a discussion.
We were discussing.

36:39.782 --> 36:42.326
It was-- it was a salon.

36:42.327 --> 36:45.622
Oh, uh, my ex just moved to LA.

36:45.621 --> 36:47.414
- Oh, really?
-I'll give you her number.

36:47.414 --> 36:48.749
-You guys would
totally get along.
- Yeah.

36:48.750 --> 36:51.126
Oh, amazing.

36:51.126 --> 36:54.338
That sounds incredible.
What's up with your ex?

36:54.338 --> 36:56.340
Cool.

36:56.340 --> 36:59.051
She just moved there
a few months ago.

36:59.052 --> 37:00.970
I didn't know
you still talked to her.

37:00.969 --> 37:03.597
-I don't, really.

37:03.597 --> 37:06.016
She just told me that
she was leaving to New York.

37:06.016 --> 37:08.519
She told you?
Like, you guys text?

37:08.519 --> 37:12.439
Not often, but she texted me
because we have...

37:13.900 --> 37:17.320
a "text when a big life event
happens" type of relationship.

37:17.320 --> 37:19.197
She's moving to LA?
What is she, an actress?

37:19.197 --> 37:20.907
-She's moved to LA.
-She's an actress?

37:20.907 --> 37:22.450
-No, she works in PR.
-Is she blonde?

37:22.449 --> 37:24.618
Okay, how tall she?
Look at me in the eyes.

37:24.619 --> 37:26.746
How-- hey!

37:26.746 --> 37:28.498
How tall is she?

37:28.498 --> 37:30.375
You know, that's something--
that we don't do that.

37:30.375 --> 37:32.794
We don't have to do that.
We're immune to stuff like that.

37:32.793 --> 37:35.671
-We are immune.
-We don't have that element
to be worried about it.

37:35.672 --> 37:37.298
We can't even get to the point
where we fight.

37:37.297 --> 37:39.383
- I'm not mad.
-You're overreacting--

37:39.384 --> 37:42.137
-I'm overreacting?
It's called reacting, so.
-You're-- I--

37:42.137 --> 37:44.014
-You know that I hate--
-I've mentioned that--

37:44.014 --> 37:46.683
Overreacting?
Are you serious?

37:46.682 --> 37:49.101
I am going to go.

37:49.101 --> 37:51.603
This was so freaking
cool and fun.

37:51.603 --> 37:54.148
- Bye.
- Bye.

37:54.148 --> 37:56.525
- Have an amazing
night, everyone.
- Love you.

37:56.525 --> 37:58.610
- Love you.
- Later.

38:01.739 --> 38:03.824
You still have
her number?

38:03.824 --> 38:05.784
Yeah, what am I supp--

38:05.784 --> 38:08.287
Am I not allowed to have
an ex-girlfriend?

38:08.288 --> 38:09.789
You need
a whole new phone now.

38:09.789 --> 38:13.460
I'm gonna go,
um, deal with this.

38:13.460 --> 38:15.128
- Okay.
- Okay?

38:15.128 --> 38:17.630
-Are you leaving
without paying?
-Leave a card.

38:17.630 --> 38:21.259
-Definitely leave a card.
-But you got a lobster,
that's not even--

38:21.259 --> 38:22.510
Even the size,
what do you think?

38:22.510 --> 38:25.555
Is there-- no way.

38:25.554 --> 38:27.514
-No kiss? No kiss?
-No.

38:27.514 --> 38:29.516
PDA is a no-no for us.

38:29.516 --> 38:32.686
-Come on, just give me a kiss.
-It's gross, it's gross.

38:32.686 --> 38:34.396
-I don't wanna do it.
-Look at them.

38:34.396 --> 38:36.065
Are you kidding?

38:36.065 --> 38:37.649
I think
they're overcompensating
for something.

38:37.650 --> 38:39.903
I mean, they were literally
just fighting.

38:39.902 --> 38:42.404
And now they're not.
I don't know.

38:42.405 --> 38:44.407
I think they really love
each other.

38:44.407 --> 38:46.826
And I think that
they've been dating
for, like, two weeks.

38:46.826 --> 38:49.496
Two months!

38:49.496 --> 38:52.332
They don't love each other.
That is the honeymoon stage.

38:52.331 --> 38:54.249
I don't know.

38:54.250 --> 38:55.669
So?

38:55.668 --> 38:58.003
What?
My place, your place?

38:58.003 --> 39:01.006
What are we doing, hmm?
What are we doin'?

39:01.007 --> 39:03.885
I think I owe you
two sleepovers, so.

39:03.885 --> 39:07.180
Um, actually...

39:08.139 --> 39:11.393
-I do.
-You got other plans?

39:11.393 --> 39:12.727
Okay, all right.

39:12.726 --> 39:14.645
So what?
That's a date?

39:14.646 --> 39:17.899
Yeah.
Yeah, I already got a date.

39:19.483 --> 39:20.526
All right.

39:22.987 --> 39:25.365
I have to dip my toes
back in the water.

39:25.364 --> 39:26.490
Come on.

39:26.490 --> 39:28.367
Actually, while I have you,

39:28.367 --> 39:30.786
is this a good text
to send someone

39:30.786 --> 39:33.539
or is it, like,
way too aggressive?

39:35.833 --> 39:37.626
-Really?
-What?

39:37.626 --> 39:39.378
Wendy, no matter
what I tell you,

39:39.586 --> 39:42.256
you're just gonna like the guy
that doesn't like you back.

39:42.257 --> 39:46.302
Hey, emotionally unavailable
people need love, too, so help.

39:47.594 --> 39:49.805
We're more afraid of you
than you are of us.

39:49.806 --> 39:51.307
That's not helpful.

39:51.306 --> 39:54.226
Give me something more.
Elaborate, please.

39:54.226 --> 39:58.731
Huh. You know,
be your charming self,
make small talk,

39:58.731 --> 40:03.360
have an emotional connection,
you know, bite your lip, right?

40:03.360 --> 40:05.946
But you can't text him.
Do not!

40:05.947 --> 40:07.949
Seriously, you have to act
like he died.

40:07.949 --> 40:10.618
Do not text him,
and then, boom, he's yours.

40:12.454 --> 40:14.914
He'll fall in love with you.

40:14.914 --> 40:16.624
Thank you.

40:16.623 --> 40:18.834
But I have to go,
and I'm gonna call you later.

40:28.052 --> 40:33.265
Uh, yeah, thank you
for the drinks.

40:33.266 --> 40:35.101
I mean, I kind of wish
you let me split it,

40:35.101 --> 40:37.395
but, whatever,
it was really nice of you.

40:37.394 --> 40:40.939
Um, so thank you... again.

40:40.940 --> 40:43.401
Yeah, of course, no worries.

40:43.400 --> 40:45.819
Uh, so drinks again next week.

40:45.820 --> 40:47.447
This was Mort,

40:47.447 --> 40:49.532
a man Wendy matched with
on Meet Cute.

40:49.532 --> 40:53.453
He lived
only one train stop away
and was a clean 6'2".

40:53.452 --> 40:56.663
Rather than seeing a therapist,
Mort co-hosted a podcast

40:56.664 --> 40:59.709
where he interviewed
ex-girlfriends about
what went wrong,

40:59.708 --> 41:02.920
called Let's Catch Up,
available on iTunes
and Spotify.

41:02.920 --> 41:04.922
So, I'll see you again
for drinks next week.

41:04.922 --> 41:07.132
We'll do drinks next week.

41:07.132 --> 41:09.134
No, actually.

41:09.135 --> 41:10.595
What? Why? what?

41:10.594 --> 41:12.763
I mean, you lied.

41:12.764 --> 41:14.015
About?

41:14.014 --> 41:15.140
Come on.

41:15.849 --> 41:17.309
-What?
-Mort.

41:17.309 --> 41:19.520
-Yes?
-Mort, you said you were 6'2".

41:22.856 --> 41:27.152
I am essentially 6'2".

41:27.152 --> 41:28.821
What-- what are you
talking about?

41:28.822 --> 41:31.950
You're not 6'2".

41:31.949 --> 41:34.618
Okay, fine.

41:34.619 --> 41:37.288
I'm like 6-- I'm like 6--
I'm like a solid 6 foot.

41:37.288 --> 41:38.957
I'm like a clean 6-- 6'0".

41:40.458 --> 41:42.002
Sure, you know what?
You're right.

41:42.001 --> 41:45.170
If I take off my shoes,
yeah, I'm six foot.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.756
-But shoes back on,
I'm probably like 6'3".
-It's okay, honestly.

41:47.757 --> 41:51.052
6'2" is merely a number.

41:51.052 --> 41:52.721
You don't wanna give
this a chance

41:52.721 --> 41:55.015
'cause I'm slightly smaller
than I said I was?

41:55.014 --> 41:57.766
"Slight" is generous, Mort,
but I appreciate you
keeping yourself up.

41:57.766 --> 42:00.728
Here, come take a seat, let me
explain something to you.

42:02.021 --> 42:06.817
Your optimism is endearing,
honestly, but let's dig deeper.

42:07.777 --> 42:09.362
Why do you feel the need

42:09.362 --> 42:12.240
to exaggerate certain aspects
of your profile?

42:12.239 --> 42:15.659
-I mean, do you not love you?
-I do love me.

42:15.659 --> 42:18.579
Oh, good.
Let's start there.

42:18.579 --> 42:23.042
It's just that dating--
dating can be so hard.

42:23.043 --> 42:25.587
It is.
It can be.

42:25.586 --> 42:29.965
And I go on all these dates
and I finally meet people
that I like,

42:29.965 --> 42:32.718
and then the more I like them,
the less they like me.

42:33.594 --> 42:35.929
Hmm, I know the feeling.
Do you smoke?

42:35.929 --> 42:37.264
-No.
-I don't either.

42:37.264 --> 42:39.933
Listen, Mort, here's the thing.

42:39.934 --> 42:43.313
Sometimes things in life
just don't pan out the way
we want them to,

42:43.313 --> 42:46.608
but you have to be able
to get over it and you have to
be okay with that.

42:46.608 --> 42:49.110
On a different couch,
in a different part
of Manhattan,

42:49.110 --> 42:51.363
Milo was enjoying
temporary validation

42:51.362 --> 42:54.406
from all the likes
on his most recent selfie.

42:54.407 --> 42:56.368
He was surprised,
but not shocked,

42:56.367 --> 42:58.869
to see that Katie 7F
liked his photo

42:58.869 --> 43:01.705
despite their theatrical
Central Park breakup.

43:01.706 --> 43:03.541
He quickly scrolled her grid,

43:03.541 --> 43:05.710
and with no evidence
of a significant other,

43:05.710 --> 43:10.048
her percentage of singlehood
was likely high.

43:26.940 --> 43:29.859
Did you know that Sunday
is the busiest day for people
on dating apps?

43:29.858 --> 43:34.238
I wonder if it's because
of the impending horror
of the work week.

43:34.239 --> 43:37.617
-Actually, I'm sure
that's probably it, yeah.

43:37.617 --> 43:41.079
Oh, and January sixth
is the busiest day of the year.

43:41.079 --> 43:42.288
Why is that?

43:42.288 --> 43:44.207
'Cause people want Valentines?

43:44.206 --> 43:45.874
No, I think it's because
people break up

43:45.875 --> 43:47.711
after they go meet
each other's families,

43:47.710 --> 43:49.712
'cause they realize, "I was
just in this relationship

43:49.713 --> 43:53.133
so I wouldn't be
the only single person
at Thanksgiving dinner."

43:53.132 --> 43:57.177
Ooh, and did you know
that you're 80% more likely
to be swiped right on

43:57.177 --> 43:59.346
if you use the word guacamole
in your profile?

43:59.347 --> 44:01.558
-Guacamole?
-Mm-hmm.

44:01.557 --> 44:03.225
Hmm.

44:03.226 --> 44:05.603
Do you know what men lie about?

44:05.603 --> 44:06.771
Their height?

44:07.771 --> 44:09.606
How did you know that?

44:09.606 --> 44:12.192
Because I'm 5'8", not 5'11".

44:12.985 --> 44:14.945
Mmm, right.

44:14.945 --> 44:16.947
Yes, I wish I knew that.

44:19.617 --> 44:21.202
Do you wanna come over?

44:21.202 --> 44:23.955
-That's a rule breaker.
-What.

44:23.954 --> 44:26.457
I am sleepy,
and I'm already in bed,

44:26.458 --> 44:30.211
and I'm watching Harry Potter,
and... yeah.

44:30.210 --> 44:32.713
But I can talk to you
until I fall asleep.

44:32.713 --> 44:36.091
-Okay, I'll settle for that.
-Mm-hmm.

44:37.802 --> 44:40.930
Wait, where did you go?

44:40.929 --> 44:45.851
I just, uh, checked Instagram.

44:46.936 --> 44:49.564
-Oh, my God.

44:49.563 --> 44:52.816
-Thank--
-But, uh, yeah, yeah,
I have to go.

44:52.817 --> 44:54.486
What?
Wait, what?

44:54.485 --> 44:56.528
Yeah, I gotta--
I gotta go for real.

44:56.528 --> 44:58.906
Whatever, you suck.

45:10.085 --> 45:11.378
- Hi.
-Hey, what's up?

45:11.378 --> 45:12.879
-Hey.

45:12.878 --> 45:14.463
-Thanks for coming.
-Yeah, for sure.

45:14.463 --> 45:16.882
-Do I...?
-Good, yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:16.882 --> 45:19.968
Um, so, yeah.

45:19.969 --> 45:21.930
Easy time getting here?

45:21.929 --> 45:24.598
Yeah, I mean,
all of six minutes it took me.

45:24.599 --> 45:26.851
-I took the stairs.
- Oh, okay.

45:26.851 --> 45:29.229
-A little cardio,
a little workout, that's good.
-Got my steps in.

45:29.228 --> 45:32.898
-Right, right, that's good.
Do you want some wine?
-I would love some wine.

45:32.898 --> 45:34.608
-Yeah, okay.
-Yes, one of those days.

45:34.608 --> 45:37.069
-I've got a nice Flemish red.
-Yep.

45:37.070 --> 45:39.030
Okay.

45:41.199 --> 45:42.784
-You like wine?
-Yeah.

45:42.784 --> 45:44.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:44.159 --> 45:45.953
You know, I indulge,
I would say.

45:45.954 --> 45:47.789
-Um...

45:47.789 --> 45:50.333
- It's hard not
to miss it, eh?

45:50.333 --> 45:53.586
- Right. Cheers.
- Cheers.

45:53.585 --> 45:56.714
Despite the contract stating
they could sleep with others,

45:56.715 --> 45:58.800
Milo had a rush
of morning guilt

45:58.800 --> 46:01.011
and Wendy couldn't help
but feel a little bitter.

46:01.010 --> 46:03.387
I guess there's something
you can learn from that.

46:03.387 --> 46:07.224
Like don't be stupid,
don't just immediately have sex
with someone, I guess.

46:07.224 --> 46:09.768
But like
any healthy adult relationship,

46:09.768 --> 46:13.105
the two addressed
their emotions head-on.

46:13.106 --> 46:15.108
-Why are you being moody?

46:15.108 --> 46:17.777
-I'm not.
-You're being really moody.

46:17.777 --> 46:20.905
-No, I'm not being moody.
-Oh, my God, let's not
play this game.

46:20.905 --> 46:22.365
Just tell me if you're mad.

46:22.364 --> 46:23.907
If you're mad,
we can talk about it.

46:23.907 --> 46:26.827
I'm not mad, I'm not.
I was just saying.

46:26.827 --> 46:29.830
While one relationship
tiptoed around their feelings,

46:29.831 --> 46:33.460
another was about to take
a huge step forward.

46:33.460 --> 46:36.463
Okay, this neighborhood
is very hot, very hot.

46:36.463 --> 46:38.340
Did you notice the Whole Foods
they were building?

46:38.340 --> 46:40.800
-They were opening one
down the street.
-Oh, on 24th?

46:40.800 --> 46:43.470
-No, the one on 23rd.
-Uh, how's the landlord?

46:43.469 --> 46:45.220
Oh, completely insane.

46:45.221 --> 46:47.974
You'd be lucky if you
get your security deposit back,

46:47.974 --> 46:51.186
but you have to ignore
all these red flags for...

46:52.478 --> 46:53.896
natural light.

46:53.896 --> 46:55.814
It's a little small,
right, Hanky?

46:57.275 --> 46:58.860
It's New York!

46:58.860 --> 47:00.487
Yeah, uh,
can I think about it?

47:00.487 --> 47:01.988
Well, not too long,

47:01.987 --> 47:04.740
because this place
is gonna be snapped up.

47:04.740 --> 47:08.118
A place like this
in this hot neighborhood,
very desirable.

47:08.119 --> 47:10.080
Take five seconds.

47:10.079 --> 47:11.955
Five, four, three, two--

47:11.956 --> 47:13.833
-I'll take it!

47:13.833 --> 47:16.044
-Good choice.
-Are you serious?

47:16.043 --> 47:17.920
-She's good.
-Okay, let's go.

47:17.920 --> 47:19.797
You're very good at your job.
All right, let's see.

47:19.797 --> 47:22.049
You're gonna definitely have to
move some of this furniture.

47:22.050 --> 47:25.387
It's very sad.
Very, very sad couch over there.

47:25.387 --> 47:27.263
And you're gonna wanna
move that up.

47:27.262 --> 47:30.140
You're gonna have to get rid
of literally everything in here.

47:30.141 --> 47:32.227
This is the saddest couch
in the universe.

47:32.226 --> 47:34.353
That's scientific fact.

47:34.353 --> 47:37.231
The sad Eiffel Tower,
"I'm a girl who studied abroad"
painting,

47:37.231 --> 47:38.565
you'll have to move that.

47:38.565 --> 47:41.777
-Come on.
-You mean, um...

47:41.777 --> 47:45.030
You mean,
we're gonna have to move that.

47:45.030 --> 47:46.740
What are you talking about?

47:48.034 --> 47:50.829
-I know that your lease is up.
-Okay.

47:50.829 --> 47:53.665
It's coming up,
and you don't like
living with roommates...

47:53.664 --> 47:58.460
-I don't.
-But what if you live with me
and I was your roommate?

48:00.422 --> 48:01.923
-Are you askng me
to move in with you?
-Mm.

48:01.922 --> 48:04.383
-In front of our new friend?
-Yeah.

48:04.384 --> 48:06.136
-Are you nervous right now?
-A little bit.

48:06.135 --> 48:08.345
I know, I could tell.
What do you want me to say?

48:08.346 --> 48:10.598
-You think I'm gonna say no?
-I want you to say yes.

48:10.597 --> 48:12.766
-Of course I'll say yes!
-'Cause I like you so much.

48:12.766 --> 48:14.643
I like you!
I like you so much.

48:14.643 --> 48:16.562
-What do you mean? Wait.
- What?

48:16.563 --> 48:18.398
-You-- you like him?
-Yeah.

48:18.398 --> 48:19.899
-You like her?
-Yeah.

48:19.898 --> 48:21.233
- Big-time.
-Do you love her?

48:21.233 --> 48:22.943
-Do you love him?

48:22.943 --> 48:24.486
The first time I'm gonna say it
in front of--

48:24.487 --> 48:26.823
-He's obsessed with me.
-Yeah, I love you.

48:26.822 --> 48:30.159
-I love you too.
-Oh, so beautiful!

48:30.159 --> 48:31.744
We're gonna live
in this little shit-hole
together.

48:31.744 --> 48:33.912
Okay, but first,
you're gonna have to--

48:33.913 --> 48:37.167
first and last month's rent
and my commission.

48:37.166 --> 48:38.542
You know what?
Anything for you.

48:38.543 --> 48:40.503
You're a queen.
Come here.

48:40.503 --> 48:42.547
-You're our girl.
- Oh!

48:42.547 --> 48:44.299
-Oh, that-- that's nice.
-Thank you.

48:46.217 --> 48:47.552
We live here now!

48:47.552 --> 48:49.721
That's my shitty couch!

48:53.349 --> 48:56.769
...to grab your attention with
its nice, broad green leaves

48:56.769 --> 48:58.437
and its air filtering prowess.

48:58.438 --> 48:59.981
Now give it a little touch.

48:59.981 --> 49:02.692
-Don't-- no, no, not too much.
-Sorry.

49:02.692 --> 49:04.652
Now it might require
a little bit more maintenance

49:04.652 --> 49:06.404
-than the other plants...
-Mm-hmm.

49:06.403 --> 49:08.697
...but as we all know,
nothing good comes easy, right?

49:08.697 --> 49:11.950
Ah, ha! Do you have anything
from the Jurassic era?

49:11.951 --> 49:13.661
-You know what, let me check.
-I'll look too.

49:13.661 --> 49:15.497
-Let me see.
-I'll give it a quick gander.

49:15.496 --> 49:17.206
You guys just do your thing.

49:17.206 --> 49:19.166
I want something that looks like
it came out of a movie.

49:19.166 --> 49:20.751
So you want a fossil?

49:20.751 --> 49:22.920
I would also want
a fossil, but...

49:26.757 --> 49:28.717
Is there a price tag?

49:31.387 --> 49:32.846
What's wrong?

49:32.847 --> 49:34.724
- We have to go now.
-Why?

49:34.724 --> 49:37.477
-I wanted to get the plant.
- We have to go now.

49:37.476 --> 49:39.812
Don't forget, don't forget,
don't forget, don't forget.

49:39.813 --> 49:42.357
-Hey, Bradley!
-Who is--

49:42.356 --> 49:44.775
Damn, damn... Wendy, Wendy.
Okay, basically, listen, here.

49:44.775 --> 49:46.151
SparkNotes version.

49:46.152 --> 49:47.904
I dated
that guy Bradley over there

49:47.903 --> 49:49.988
and he basically ghosted me
for an unknown reason.

49:49.989 --> 49:51.741
Maybe it could have been
because I texted him
a bunch of times.

49:51.740 --> 49:53.283
I'm not sure, but he's here,
so we're gonna say hi.

49:53.284 --> 49:54.577
-All right.
-We're gonna be fierce.

49:54.577 --> 49:57.539
Be the better version of you.

49:57.539 --> 49:59.666
-Hey!
-Hello!

49:59.666 --> 50:01.334
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

50:01.333 --> 50:03.043
I was blind, but now I see.

50:03.043 --> 50:04.920
-I see you.
-Duh, missed it, missed it.

50:04.920 --> 50:07.923
Sorry, that was aggressive.

50:07.923 --> 50:09.925
-Hi, what's up?
- Kind of insensitive,
given the climate.

50:09.925 --> 50:11.760
-Okay.
-How are you?

50:11.760 --> 50:14.346
Good. I mean, I don't know,
how is the sun, you know?

50:14.347 --> 50:17.642
How is the sky?
It's grateful and expansive.

50:17.641 --> 50:20.102
-Thank you, Father, up there.
- Thank you.

50:20.103 --> 50:21.855
Thank you for asking me.
How are you?

50:21.855 --> 50:24.607
-I'm amazing. Look, I'm--
-Come here, come here.

50:24.606 --> 50:27.443
-Oh, okay.
-Mm.

50:27.443 --> 50:30.362
Mm, yeah, it is you, it is you.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

50:30.362 --> 50:32.239
Brad, baby, I found one.

50:32.239 --> 50:33.574
Oh, Erica.

50:33.574 --> 50:35.451
Hey, uh, this is Wendy,
actually.

50:35.452 --> 50:37.370
-Oh, hi.
-Hi.

50:37.369 --> 50:39.496
- Hi...
- Hey.

50:39.496 --> 50:41.999
She looks just like you.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.753
-Oh, stop, that's so--
-You're so sweet.

50:44.753 --> 50:46.504
This is Milo.
Sorry, this is Milo.

50:46.503 --> 50:48.547
-He's, um... He's my friend.
-Yeah, hey. What's up?

50:48.547 --> 50:50.674
He's my, um, sex friend.

50:50.675 --> 50:53.261
-Yeah, by contract.
-By contract, by contract.

50:53.260 --> 50:55.512
Well, Erica's my fiancée.

50:55.512 --> 50:56.972
So, we're waiting.

50:56.972 --> 50:58.640
Just kidding!
We're freaks!

50:58.641 --> 51:00.894
Wow!
Did you hear that, Milo?

51:00.893 --> 51:02.853
He has a fiancée now.

51:02.853 --> 51:04.980
That's crazy!
It's wild!

51:04.981 --> 51:07.984
I just-- I remember
you kind of saying something
along the lines

51:07.983 --> 51:10.819
of, "Hey, you know, Wendy,
I don't wanna date you anymore.

51:10.820 --> 51:12.447
I wanna date myself
and be single."

51:12.447 --> 51:14.824
And I was like, "Oh, cool,
you go do that."

51:14.824 --> 51:17.660
Well, last time you saw me,
I was like...  "Whoo!"

51:17.659 --> 51:19.620
-You know?
That was me!
- Yes, yes.

51:19.621 --> 51:22.123
But not anymore, not anymore,
'cause I was looking.

51:22.123 --> 51:23.750
I was searching,
I was searching.

51:23.750 --> 51:25.584
But, you know,
the universe provides, right?

51:25.585 --> 51:27.545
"I was trying to date myself,"
you know,

51:27.545 --> 51:29.255
what an egotistical thing
to say.

51:29.255 --> 51:31.299
-No, babe, that was your past.
-That was my past.

51:31.298 --> 51:33.842
Then they put us together
at the singles' table

51:33.842 --> 51:36.136
at a mutual friend's wedding
and, um...

51:36.137 --> 51:38.056
I don't know
how to describe it,
we just fell in love.

51:38.056 --> 51:39.974
We just fell in love.

51:39.974 --> 51:41.893
I'm so happy to say that
out loud.

51:41.893 --> 51:44.562
- It still gets me.
Oh, my God.
-Yeah, baby.

51:44.561 --> 51:46.105
Isn't that great?

51:46.106 --> 51:47.482
-Wow.
-We found the energy.

51:47.481 --> 51:48.982
-Isn't that great?
-That's great.

51:49.192 --> 51:53.697
You know what that is?
That's rollover feelings.

51:56.657 --> 51:59.326
It's like rollover minutes,
but with feelings.

52:00.161 --> 52:01.371
Huh.

52:02.121 --> 52:05.708
It's like rollover minutes,
but it's with feelings

52:05.708 --> 52:07.960
and you got the family plan
of feelings.

52:07.960 --> 52:10.045
-Like the phone plan!
-Oh, my God, oh, my God!

52:10.045 --> 52:12.589
-I'm gonna roll over
with laughter from that.
-Yeah, oh, my God!

52:12.590 --> 52:15.552
You jokester.
So charming.
He's funny.

52:15.552 --> 52:17.470
You're very funny.
What does he do?

52:17.469 --> 52:19.680
-It's a new bit I'm working on.
-He's a comedian.

52:19.681 --> 52:21.349
-Oh, I love Canadians.
-Me too.

52:21.349 --> 52:23.268
That's so cool.
They are very funny.

52:23.268 --> 52:25.478
I have some rollover feelings
about a coffee table there.

52:25.478 --> 52:28.106
-Yeah. Oh, my God!
-I'm sorry, I stole your joke.

52:28.106 --> 52:29.566
-Mee-lo?
-Milo.

52:29.565 --> 52:31.108
-Milo, great. Okay.
-Milo.

52:31.108 --> 52:32.818
- Bless you.
-Yeah.

52:32.818 --> 52:34.820
Uh, good luck with the sex.
It sounds fantastic.

52:34.820 --> 52:36.238
-Bye.
- Goodbye.

52:36.239 --> 52:38.366
Blessings to you.

52:38.365 --> 52:40.242
After running
into Bradley,

52:40.242 --> 52:43.454
Wendy was visited
by Ghost of Boyfriends Past.

52:43.454 --> 52:46.582
Always the heartbroken
and never the heartbreaker,

52:46.583 --> 52:48.543
it finally clicked.

52:48.543 --> 52:53.173
To never feel heartbreak again,
she need only do one thing.

53:00.429 --> 53:03.849
On a different phone screen,
with no new matches,

53:03.849 --> 53:06.643
Milo made
a life-changing decision.

53:19.865 --> 53:21.700
As both were down
on dating,

53:21.701 --> 53:24.537
Milo and Wendy visited
Tompkins Square Park,

53:24.536 --> 53:27.873
New York's breakup hot spot,
to relieve some despair

53:27.873 --> 53:31.710
via people who were full
of even more resentment
than they were.

53:31.710 --> 53:33.921
"You don't take
my food blogging seriously."

53:33.922 --> 53:36.091
"I would love to take
your food blogging seriously,

53:36.090 --> 53:39.593
but you
literally only blog things
I'm allergic to, I can't eat."

53:39.594 --> 53:41.721
"Uh, yeah, I blog
things that you're allergic to

53:41.721 --> 53:44.307
because I wanna raise awareness
around your allergy."

53:44.306 --> 53:47.059
-"Oh, babe,
I need you to stop crying."
-"I'm not crying."

53:47.059 --> 53:49.061
-"You're always crying."
-"I don't always cry."

53:49.061 --> 53:51.063
"Can we just have
an adult conversation
for once?"

53:51.063 --> 53:52.731
"We're are having
an adult conversation."

53:52.731 --> 53:55.150
-"Oh, my God."
-"Stop. Stop it."

53:55.150 --> 53:57.194
"I literally can't.
I need to go have a beer."

53:57.195 --> 53:59.280
-"You're just not emotionally
vulnerable like I am."
-"I am!"

53:59.280 --> 54:00.907
"And that's something
that you need to work on."

54:00.907 --> 54:02.909
"I bought the journal
like you told me to."

54:02.909 --> 54:05.161
-"I bought it!"
-"You never use it,
'cause I've read it."

54:05.161 --> 54:08.331
You ever think
about how now it's so easy
to break up with someone?

54:08.331 --> 54:10.166
Back in the day, what?

54:10.166 --> 54:14.921
You had to, like, show up
to their house, do it in person.

54:14.920 --> 54:18.090
Now you can just...
"It's not workin' out,
slanty face."

54:18.090 --> 54:22.720
I, for such an occasion,
have a pre-written breakup text.

54:22.721 --> 54:24.806
-Like a template?
-Yeah.

54:24.806 --> 54:26.182
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

54:26.181 --> 54:27.808
-Show me.
-No.

54:27.809 --> 54:29.310
Why?

54:29.309 --> 54:30.686
Fine.

54:30.686 --> 54:32.312
-You ready?
-Lay it on me, yes.

54:32.313 --> 54:34.607
-Break up with me,
break my heart.
-Okay.

54:36.735 --> 54:39.779
"Hey, insert name there,

54:39.778 --> 54:42.031
thank you so much
for the last couple of dates.

54:42.032 --> 54:44.409
They were really fun.

54:44.409 --> 54:47.787
Unfortunately, I feel
more of a friend vibe going,

54:47.786 --> 54:50.372
but you're such a great person,
and I really hope

54:50.373 --> 54:53.293
that you have a great future
and a successful year."

54:53.293 --> 54:54.711
-That's it?
-That's it.

54:54.710 --> 54:57.212
You feel more
of a friend vibe going?

54:57.213 --> 54:58.715
If I got that after a date,
I'd be like,

54:58.715 --> 55:00.175
"Oh, great,
they wanna see me again."

55:00.175 --> 55:03.178
-What?
-Yeah, that doesn't seem bad.

55:03.177 --> 55:06.138
I think you're the only person
that would read that text
that way.

55:06.139 --> 55:07.849
Honestly, just ghost me.

55:07.849 --> 55:10.977
I'm not even...
I don't wanna even get the text.

55:10.976 --> 55:14.563
Just let me spiral,
let me make up my own story.

55:14.563 --> 55:17.524
-Let me write that
in my Noteshelf.
-Okay, I keep it in mine.

55:17.525 --> 55:19.652
"Ghost Milo."

55:19.652 --> 55:21.863
It's just every time
I've liked someone,
they've ghosted me.

55:21.862 --> 55:25.616
And at this point, fine,
I'll just be single forever.

55:25.617 --> 55:28.995
-Are you kidding?
-It's like, what am I--
what am I doing?

55:30.204 --> 55:35.959
You are smart, and funny,
and kind, and inspiring,

55:35.960 --> 55:39.673
and hard-working,
and determined, and passionate.

55:41.757 --> 55:43.467
You're gonna be just fine.

55:47.597 --> 55:48.598
Okay.

55:50.307 --> 55:51.892
-That was a good pep talk.
-Thank you.

55:51.893 --> 55:53.436
I think I know what I want now.

55:54.813 --> 55:56.022
What is that?

55:57.481 --> 55:59.608
"I think I'm gonna be
a food blogger and..."

55:59.608 --> 56:00.609
"You're gonna be
a food blogger?"

56:01.945 --> 56:03.780
"I'm gonna start by blogging
about this brunch
we're going to."

56:03.780 --> 56:05.949
-"I'm all about brunch."
-"It's gonna be so good."

56:05.949 --> 56:09.202
"It's gonna be so good, right?
It's gonna be so good."

56:09.202 --> 56:10.870
-"You want a ride?"
-"Okay, go."

56:12.121 --> 56:14.164
To blogging!

56:15.166 --> 56:18.003
- Oh, my God.
- Your curls are
literally perfect today.

56:18.003 --> 56:20.964
-Can I touch one?
-Yes, every curl has a story.

56:20.963 --> 56:23.173
Does it?
Tell me this one's story.

56:23.173 --> 56:24.925
What happened to this one?

56:24.925 --> 56:27.761
-He is a first-generation
college student.
-Mm-hmm.

56:27.762 --> 56:30.181
And he is going to be
taking care of his family.

56:30.181 --> 56:33.977
-Oh, sad.
-Which is so--
But he really takes pride in it.

56:33.976 --> 56:35.894
He really takes pride
and enjoys it.

56:35.894 --> 56:39.273
-Get another one.
-All right, I want this one.

56:39.273 --> 56:42.317
- That one
is a billionaire, actually.
-Okay.

56:42.318 --> 56:45.572
All the other curls hate him.
- That makes sense.

56:45.572 --> 56:47.032
-That's makes sense.
-Yeah.

56:47.032 --> 56:48.575
Like the Daddy Warbucks.

56:48.574 --> 56:50.534
I don't know why I'm referencing
musicals today.

56:50.534 --> 56:52.453
What's going on here?

56:53.663 --> 56:55.415
-What?
-What?

56:55.414 --> 56:57.958
You decided to sit
on the same side of the booth.

56:57.958 --> 57:00.669
It's kind of a pretty big booth.

57:00.670 --> 57:03.882
Uh, would-- yeah, well,
if we sat right there,

57:03.882 --> 57:06.259
we'd be closing ourselves off
from the world.

57:06.259 --> 57:08.845
Exactly, I like to look.
Like, "Oh, hey, what's up?"

57:08.844 --> 57:10.763
Oh, look, that guy--
that's a great coat.

57:10.764 --> 57:12.265
-Maybe I wanna get that coat.
-Wow.

57:12.264 --> 57:14.600
-Oh, a taxi!
-Oh, look, there's a taxi.

57:14.601 --> 57:16.561
We're taking in New York.

57:16.561 --> 57:19.064
Also, the seat creases there.
I don't wanna sit in the sink.

57:19.063 --> 57:20.647
If you don't like the streets,
don't live in New York.

57:20.648 --> 57:22.400
Also, I like to look at you
in the eye.

57:22.400 --> 57:24.361
I like to have a conversation
with you eye to eye.

57:24.360 --> 57:26.737
Are you gonna pull up a chair
right there and then--

57:26.737 --> 57:28.113
Exactly!
Exactly, that's so rude.

57:28.447 --> 57:31.158
- It only makes sense.
-Something's different.

57:33.911 --> 57:36.288
You guys
are more into each other
than you were before.

57:39.958 --> 57:42.920
-That-- I mean, yeah.
- No.

57:42.920 --> 57:44.713
It's, uh...

57:44.713 --> 57:47.049
You've noticed
that we have a...

57:47.050 --> 57:48.677
-Have a freelance.
-We upgraded.

57:48.677 --> 57:51.221
We're freelancing
an upgraded relationship.

57:51.221 --> 57:52.722
Yeah,
a freelance relationship.

57:52.722 --> 57:56.059
Oh, a free--
a freelance relationship?

57:56.059 --> 57:57.727
Funny you should ask because...

57:57.726 --> 58:01.313
Because a freelance
relationship is, uh...

58:01.313 --> 58:04.900
a relationship where you are...

58:04.900 --> 58:07.736
Given your status,
you have a fair amount
of benefits.

58:07.737 --> 58:10.073
You have a certain amount
of relationship benefits.

58:10.072 --> 58:14.660
Benefits that you can take,
and you leave the awful ones.

58:14.661 --> 58:16.746
So it's friends
without benefits.

58:16.746 --> 58:19.958
Depending on your employer
and your insurance package.

58:19.958 --> 58:21.626
-Boom.
-It's a bit I'm working on.

58:21.626 --> 58:23.670
-You got yours wallet-size?
-I did, actually.

58:23.670 --> 58:26.006
-It's really nice.
Here, I made you one too.
-Oh, thank you.

58:27.132 --> 58:28.967
Let me see this.

58:28.967 --> 58:30.301
And look, laminated.

58:30.300 --> 58:32.386
You went to Staples,

58:32.387 --> 58:34.014
and took a little piece
of paper,

58:34.014 --> 58:35.849
and made them laminate it?

58:35.849 --> 58:38.226
-Why are you so invested?
-What is this? Do you litigate?

58:38.226 --> 58:40.437
Okay, can you guys stop talking?

58:41.353 --> 58:44.440
I called you here today
because, um...

58:53.615 --> 58:54.700
Yes!

58:55.952 --> 58:57.328
Yes!

58:57.327 --> 58:59.872
Yes, put it on,
put it on!

58:59.873 --> 59:02.917
-Okay, seriously,
though, that is--
-That is--

59:02.916 --> 59:04.293
Amazing!

59:04.293 --> 59:06.837
Yeah, I'm gonna ask her
on Thanksgiving.

59:06.838 --> 59:09.049
-Wow.
-You wanna touch the box?

59:09.048 --> 59:11.175
-Yeah, it's velvet.
-This whole relationship

59:11.175 --> 59:13.969
is moving
at seventh grade speeds.

59:13.969 --> 59:15.929
-Yeah, we're doing...
-It is, kind of.

59:20.976 --> 59:23.645
Is it messed up if...

59:24.646 --> 59:26.190
Huh, okay.

59:26.190 --> 59:30.444
Do I owe this girl--
woman a breakup text

59:30.445 --> 59:33.073
if we only went on one date?

59:33.072 --> 59:34.740
No.

59:34.740 --> 59:37.368
Maybe, honestly,
if you had sex with her.

59:37.369 --> 59:39.371
-Did you have sex with her?
-No.

59:39.371 --> 59:41.664
Well, then you don't
really need to explain anything.

59:41.664 --> 59:44.042
It's not really ghosting
if there's no sex involved

59:44.041 --> 59:46.126
or if you went
on more than one date.

59:47.711 --> 59:50.005
Okay, I lied.
We had sex, we had sex.

59:50.005 --> 59:51.548
Then you should probably
send a text.

59:51.548 --> 59:54.009
You should send,
like, a simple breakup text.

59:54.010 --> 59:56.721
But I feel like if I do that,
then she's gonna think

59:56.721 --> 59:59.474
that it's because we had sex,
but it's not.

59:59.474 --> 01:00:02.769
It's because...
I just didn't like her.

01:00:02.768 --> 01:00:03.769
Oh.

01:00:03.769 --> 01:00:05.312
She just...

01:00:05.313 --> 01:00:07.273
I feel like that sounds harsh,
but she...

01:00:07.273 --> 01:00:10.110
It does.

01:00:10.110 --> 01:00:14.072
She just wasn't it.
She just, she just wasn't it.

01:00:14.072 --> 01:00:17.701
She kept asking
what time I was born,
and that was the only question

01:00:17.701 --> 01:00:20.120
she asked about
my personal life at all.

01:00:20.119 --> 01:00:21.995
The whole date.
And then at the end
of the night,

01:00:21.996 --> 01:00:24.791
she was like,
"Have a wonderful night,"

01:00:24.791 --> 01:00:27.961
just like in this weird tone,
like Mary Poppins tone.

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:30.879
-Mm-hmm.
-And she lives
in Murray Hill, so.

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:33.091
-Oh, very dramatic.
-That is a no.

01:00:33.090 --> 01:00:34.258
Well, why don't you just
be like,

01:00:34.259 --> 01:00:38.138
"Hey, you know, date was fine,

01:00:38.137 --> 01:00:41.181
we're better as friends"?

01:00:41.181 --> 01:00:43.934
I don't wanna see her again.
I don't wanna
see her again.

01:00:43.934 --> 01:00:47.938
Okay, then just be like,
"Hey, I'm not looking for
anything serious."

01:00:47.938 --> 01:00:50.024
Well, that'd be lying.

01:00:50.025 --> 01:00:53.153
Okay, then just don't say
anything at all.

01:00:53.152 --> 01:00:55.362
Okay, settled.
I won't say anything.

01:00:55.362 --> 01:00:56.822
-Boom. Nailed it.
-Easy.

01:00:59.451 --> 01:01:00.452
Boom.

01:01:01.452 --> 01:01:03.245
Could you pass me
a fortune cookie?

01:01:03.246 --> 01:01:05.749
No, it is bad luck to eat
a fortune cookie

01:01:05.748 --> 01:01:07.541
before you have finished
your meal.

01:01:07.541 --> 01:01:10.502
-Okay. That makes sense.
-You're welcome.

01:01:10.503 --> 01:01:14.591
Just gonna...
get some dinner running.

01:01:16.384 --> 01:01:19.763
- God. So smooth.

01:01:27.686 --> 01:01:30.939
-What if we became boyfriend
and girlfriend?

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:32.942
Yeah, what if we were boyfriend
and girlfriend?

01:01:32.942 --> 01:01:36.112
-No, I'm serious.
-It's a great idea.

01:01:36.112 --> 01:01:38.031
What if we were exclusive?

01:01:39.365 --> 01:01:41.116
But you don't want that.

01:01:41.117 --> 01:01:42.202
Yeah, I do.

01:01:43.869 --> 01:01:47.122
Wait, why are-- why are you
doing this?

01:01:48.583 --> 01:01:53.171
Because I think that we would
be good together?

01:01:53.170 --> 01:01:54.171
Mm-hmm.

01:01:54.922 --> 01:01:57.257
And I like what we're doing.

01:01:58.092 --> 01:02:00.803
You know, we're-- we're--
we have this great thing where

01:02:00.804 --> 01:02:03.390
we're allowed to be single
but not be lonely.

01:02:03.389 --> 01:02:06.892
-Like, that's the dream.
-Oh, I don't know.

01:02:06.893 --> 01:02:08.353
I feel like we have two
different versions

01:02:08.353 --> 01:02:09.938
of what a dream is.

01:02:12.898 --> 01:02:17.820
Okay, well,
then maybe we should stop.

01:02:19.155 --> 01:02:20.865
Stop what?

01:02:20.864 --> 01:02:23.784
Stop hanging out, stop talking
every day,

01:02:23.784 --> 01:02:27.121
stop watching TV shows together.

01:02:27.121 --> 01:02:28.122
Okay.

01:02:30.833 --> 01:02:34.086
That's cool, but the thing is...

01:02:38.090 --> 01:02:39.383
I love you.

01:02:42.177 --> 01:02:43.178
-I love you.

01:02:44.431 --> 01:02:46.266
I'm sorry.

01:02:46.266 --> 01:02:48.101
You don't love me.

01:02:48.101 --> 01:02:49.644
There's no way,
you don't love me!

01:02:49.643 --> 01:02:51.478
How could you love me?

01:02:55.483 --> 01:02:57.819
What do you mean
how could I love you?

01:02:57.818 --> 01:03:00.237
What-- we spend so much time
together.

01:03:00.237 --> 01:03:04.116
-Milo, Milo, Milo, Milo, Milo,
you love everyone.
-We're always--

01:03:04.117 --> 01:03:06.661
You love everyone
and everything.

01:03:08.704 --> 01:03:09.788
You're afraid.

01:03:10.914 --> 01:03:12.708
-You're afraid.
-Excuse me?

01:03:12.708 --> 01:03:14.918
-You're afraid.
-What are you even
talking about?

01:03:14.918 --> 01:03:18.047
-You're afraid to be loved.
-That's not fair.
I'm not afraid.

01:03:18.047 --> 01:03:19.131
You...

01:03:20.925 --> 01:03:25.221
So if it's
going good, you like it,
you're having a good time,

01:03:25.221 --> 01:03:28.725
which is what you said,
we're havin' a good time,
what's stopping you?

01:03:28.724 --> 01:03:31.935
Okay, okay,
you wanna know what happens?
What happens when we date?

01:03:31.936 --> 01:03:33.688
Let's just say we start dating,
all right?

01:03:33.688 --> 01:03:36.483
And then suddenly, there are
all these expectations

01:03:36.483 --> 01:03:37.859
and they just keep piling,
and piling,

01:03:37.858 --> 01:03:39.568
and piling, and piling,
and piling,

01:03:39.568 --> 01:03:42.029
and then suddenly, you know,
I'm getting mad at you,

01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:44.908
because, you know, you're not,
you're not expressing your
feelings well enough

01:03:44.907 --> 01:03:47.534
or you don't even wanna come
near me,

01:03:47.534 --> 01:03:49.787
because I'm suffocating you
all the time.

01:03:49.788 --> 01:03:52.415
And then we finally
get to the point
where we break up,

01:03:52.414 --> 01:03:54.416
and we never see each other
again,

01:03:54.416 --> 01:03:57.753
and we have no friends,
and we're just alone.

01:03:59.005 --> 01:04:01.132
That wouldn't happen.

01:04:01.132 --> 01:04:03.259
That wouldn't happen.

01:04:03.259 --> 01:04:04.260
Not to us.

01:04:06.429 --> 01:04:07.847
You're afraid of being alone.

01:04:07.847 --> 01:04:09.099
I'm not afraid of being alone.

01:04:09.099 --> 01:04:10.684
I love bein' alone.

01:04:10.684 --> 01:04:12.977
I've been alone so much.

01:04:12.976 --> 01:04:14.353
I just wanna be alone with you.

01:04:14.353 --> 01:04:16.397
And I wanna be alone alone.

01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:25.258
-I haven't even thought about
her in what? Uh, three weeks.

01:05:25.257 --> 01:05:30.387
-I can't even-- it-- it's so far
out of mind at this point.
-That's great!

01:05:30.387 --> 01:05:33.432
- I can't get Milo
out of my head.

01:05:33.432 --> 01:05:36.560
Mm, I'm sorry, it'll pass.
Remember, half the time
you were together

01:05:36.561 --> 01:05:38.355
equals the time it takes
to get over them.

01:05:38.355 --> 01:05:40.774
It's math.
I'm basically a scientist.

01:05:40.773 --> 01:05:43.317
We were supposed to be
the unsinkable relationship,
you know?

01:05:43.318 --> 01:05:46.613
-Like the Titanic.
-The Titanic sunk, dude.

01:05:46.612 --> 01:05:48.030
But the love lasts forever.

01:05:48.030 --> 01:05:49.406
I'm worried I made a mistake.

01:05:49.407 --> 01:05:51.910
No, it didn't work out,
that's okay.

01:05:51.909 --> 01:05:54.828
Just 'cause it ends doesn't mean
it wasn't a successful thing
when it was happening.

01:05:54.829 --> 01:05:57.248
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah, but what if I didn't
give it a real shot?

01:05:57.248 --> 01:05:59.751
-I always do this to myself.
-Is this self-sabotage?

01:05:59.751 --> 01:06:01.836
I mean, I really just hope
that she found somebody
that she likes.

01:06:01.835 --> 01:06:03.962
Like, I'm good, I just hope
she's good.

01:06:03.963 --> 01:06:07.008
What? Why are you wishing--
look, look,

01:06:07.007 --> 01:06:09.968
you are being way too hard
on yourself, okay?

01:06:09.969 --> 01:06:12.889
You guys weren't supposed to be
"not together" together anyways.

01:06:12.889 --> 01:06:15.183
I mean, how can you even
break up when--

01:06:15.182 --> 01:06:17.351
-You weren't even dating.
- It's for the best.

01:06:17.351 --> 01:06:19.353
I'm sure he'll just fall
in love with the next girl

01:06:19.353 --> 01:06:21.105
he locks eyes with
on the L train.

01:06:21.106 --> 01:06:23.858
-Have you spoken to each other?
-Have you spoken to her?

01:06:23.858 --> 01:06:25.485
-No.
-I accidentally viewed
her LinkedIn.

01:06:25.485 --> 01:06:27.904
Well, he viewed my LinkedIn.

01:06:27.903 --> 01:06:29.780
-How is he?
-How is she?

01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:32.116
-You'll see her at the wedding.
-You'll see him at the wedding.

01:06:32.117 --> 01:06:33.785
-Are you alone?
-Wait, who are you talking to?

01:06:33.784 --> 01:06:35.744
-Oh, I'm with Hank.
-I'm with Jess.

01:06:35.744 --> 01:06:37.413
-Pi-pa-po.
-That's so cute.

01:06:37.414 --> 01:06:38.581
Cute.

01:06:38.581 --> 01:06:40.125
Are you seeing anyone?

01:06:40.125 --> 01:06:41.834
I'm just sort of, like,
dating myself right now.

01:06:41.835 --> 01:06:44.921
Yeah, just-- yeah, and I'm
really happy about it.

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:46.547
Yeah, actually, this guy.

01:06:46.547 --> 01:06:48.424
He's in finance,
he works constantly,

01:06:48.425 --> 01:06:49.968
and he's completely emotionally
unavailable,

01:06:49.967 --> 01:06:52.469
which is perfect,
and I'm really happy.

01:06:52.469 --> 01:06:54.096
That's great.

01:06:54.097 --> 01:06:55.682
Dating sucks.

01:06:55.681 --> 01:06:57.933
- Uh-huh.

01:06:58.809 --> 01:06:59.810
Absolutely.

01:07:00.728 --> 01:07:05.107
Well, we can definitely
be there Monday if we have to.

01:07:05.108 --> 01:07:07.527
I would never say we won't.

01:07:07.527 --> 01:07:09.154
Okay.

01:07:09.153 --> 01:07:11.155
Absolutamente.

01:07:11.155 --> 01:07:13.157
No, we're delighted.

01:07:13.157 --> 01:07:14.950
You kidding me?
This is great!

01:07:14.951 --> 01:07:17.495
-So, hey.
- This was
Trent Wilkinson,

01:07:17.494 --> 01:07:21.081
an incredibly emotionally
unavailable 34-year-old

01:07:21.081 --> 01:07:24.626
who lied about his age
to make the Feingold
30 Under 30 list

01:07:24.626 --> 01:07:28.881
for selling his sock company,
GotSoxx, spelt with two Xs.

01:07:28.882 --> 01:07:31.885
He DM'd Wendy on Instagram
after finding her geo tag

01:07:31.885 --> 01:07:33.803
at Surf Lodge in Montauk.

01:07:33.802 --> 01:07:36.263
Wendy had spent
the last three weekends

01:07:36.264 --> 01:07:37.932
at Trent's apartment in Tribeca

01:07:37.931 --> 01:07:40.476
and even had
her own toothbrush.

01:07:40.476 --> 01:07:44.480
Attention, uh, Kmart shoppers,
I'm gonna be presenting

01:07:44.481 --> 01:07:47.233
to, like, a whole bunch
of restaurant groups

01:07:47.233 --> 01:07:49.277
because they said that my app
is brilliant.

01:07:49.277 --> 01:07:52.614
-Wow! That's amazing!
That's so amazing!
-Yeah! I know.

01:07:52.614 --> 01:07:55.116
Oh, my God!
I mean, it is brilliant
and you're brilliant.

01:07:55.115 --> 01:07:57.242
-Yeah. Makes sense right?
-Yeah. It does.

01:07:57.242 --> 01:08:00.245
-But, yeah.
-It makes perfect sense.
When are you, um, leaving, then?

01:08:00.246 --> 01:08:04.459
Uh, it's, like, Sunday.

01:08:05.418 --> 01:08:07.295
Sunday night.

01:08:07.295 --> 01:08:09.881
Sunday, like tomorrow?

01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:13.175
Uh, yeah.

01:08:13.175 --> 01:08:16.053
-Tomorrow, uh-- tomorrow night.
-Awesome.

01:08:16.054 --> 01:08:18.430
Awesome, and how long are you
gonna be gone?

01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:21.100
They said, uh, it was gonna be
like meetings,

01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:22.975
and greetings,
and stuff like that

01:08:22.975 --> 01:08:25.145
for, like, a couple of weeks.

01:08:25.145 --> 01:08:26.438
-Wow!
-Yeah.

01:08:26.439 --> 01:08:28.733
-That's amazing!
-Yeah.

01:08:28.733 --> 01:08:32.569
No, I know, it just, uh,
maybe we could, like, uh,

01:08:33.529 --> 01:08:37.448
just kinda slow her down
a little bit.

01:08:37.783 --> 01:08:40.368
Yeah, I-- I know.
I-- yeah, I mean.

01:08:40.368 --> 01:08:45.082
Just, like, pull the car over
for a bit.

01:08:45.291 --> 01:08:47.085
-Oh.
-Bad metaphor.

01:08:47.085 --> 01:08:48.461
Uh, just slow down.

01:08:52.673 --> 01:08:55.216
While Wendy sold
all her stock in Trent,

01:08:55.216 --> 01:08:57.261
Milo was three stops
into the one

01:08:57.261 --> 01:09:00.555
on his way to a John Mayer
concert.

01:09:00.555 --> 01:09:04.059
Did I tell you about the time
that I got a fortune cookie?

01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:06.938
-No fortune
in the fortune cookie.
-No.

01:09:06.938 --> 01:09:11.901
Her name was Jenna Brookes,
and she was a recent graduate
of NYU's Gallatin program

01:09:11.899 --> 01:09:15.194
where she wrote her thesis on
the life, death, and rebirth

01:09:15.194 --> 01:09:18.282
of chivalry in millennial
dating culture.

01:09:18.283 --> 01:09:20.535
Yeah, there was no fortune
in the fortune cookie.

01:09:20.533 --> 01:09:23.287
-That's crazy, yeah.
-That's crazy.

01:09:23.287 --> 01:09:25.163
-What's wrong?

01:09:25.163 --> 01:09:26.582
-Nothing. No.
-Something's wrong,
what's wrong?

01:09:26.582 --> 01:09:28.751
-No, I'm excited.
-No, you're not.

01:09:28.752 --> 01:09:30.462
-Yes, I am.
-You're not excited,
something's up.

01:09:30.462 --> 01:09:32.212
-No.
-We're going to see John Mayer.

01:09:32.212 --> 01:09:35.049
-Yay!
-You don't seem stoked.

01:09:35.050 --> 01:09:37.218
-No, I'm excited.
-Something's wrong.

01:09:37.216 --> 01:09:39.553
♪ Something is wrong ♪

01:09:39.554 --> 01:09:40.846
I'm not going to stop
bothering you

01:09:40.845 --> 01:09:42.473
until you tell me what's wrong.

01:09:42.474 --> 01:09:45.225
I think-- I think we want
different things.

01:09:45.225 --> 01:09:46.393
What?

01:09:46.394 --> 01:09:47.687
What, what do you mean?

01:09:47.685 --> 01:09:49.479
What are you talking about?

01:09:49.479 --> 01:09:52.316
I don't-- I don't think I see
a future with us.

01:09:55.319 --> 01:09:56.320
No.

01:09:57.363 --> 01:09:58.906
You FaceTimed my mom.

01:09:58.907 --> 01:10:00.533
-Yes, that was--
-I let you FaceTime my mom.

01:10:00.533 --> 01:10:02.202
Well, she's wonderful.
I loved her!

01:10:02.202 --> 01:10:04.204
Oh, I wish that we-- I love her.

01:10:04.203 --> 01:10:05.746
The next stop
is Heartbreak Boulevard.

01:10:05.747 --> 01:10:09.042
I think you, uh, I like you.

01:10:09.042 --> 01:10:11.544
You deserve someone great, so...

01:10:16.091 --> 01:10:19.052
No, I'm sorry, I don't wanna
kiss you.

01:10:19.051 --> 01:10:20.386
Okay, don't cry.

01:10:20.386 --> 01:10:22.096
I have to-- I have to go.

01:10:22.096 --> 01:10:23.847
- Dang it!

01:10:23.847 --> 01:10:25.432
Things turn around, they change.

01:10:25.432 --> 01:10:27.976
That sounds like it should be
encouraging,

01:10:27.976 --> 01:10:30.270
but it's actually really
depressing.

01:10:30.270 --> 01:10:32.231
Okay, new topic.

01:10:32.231 --> 01:10:35.275
Uh, the podcast thing.
The podcast thing.

01:10:35.275 --> 01:10:37.945
Did you-- did you start it?
You should start it.

01:10:37.945 --> 01:10:41.073
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm probably gonna
do some, some episodes.

01:10:41.073 --> 01:10:43.200
I just gotta get a microphone,

01:10:43.201 --> 01:10:44.786
and then come up with some ideas

01:10:44.786 --> 01:10:46.830
for episodes and the podcast.

01:10:46.829 --> 01:10:48.997
Well, here's an idea.
You should have me on
as a guest.

01:10:48.997 --> 01:10:50.958
Maybe not like your first guest
out of the gate,

01:10:50.958 --> 01:10:53.377
but let me-- I quit this place,

01:10:53.377 --> 01:10:55.796
I'm gonna spill all the tea
on everybody.

01:10:55.796 --> 01:10:57.506
I mean, there's some stuff
that's going on in here

01:10:57.506 --> 01:10:59.049
that I think the listeners

01:10:59.050 --> 01:11:00.677
would wanna know.

01:11:00.676 --> 01:11:02.344
-Oh.
-Yeah.

01:11:02.345 --> 01:11:04.806
Come on, man,
I miss you smilin'.

01:11:04.805 --> 01:11:05.889
You're, like,
one of the few reasons

01:11:05.890 --> 01:11:07.183
why I stay in this place.

01:11:07.182 --> 01:11:08.434
The phone never stops here--

01:11:08.435 --> 01:11:11.312
-Front desk.

01:11:11.311 --> 01:11:12.563
At a bar in Hell's Kitchen,

01:11:12.564 --> 01:11:14.232
where she would never return,

01:11:14.231 --> 01:11:16.233
Wendy listened to a man she met
at Whole Foods

01:11:16.234 --> 01:11:18.361
talk about his screenplay
that would never get made.

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:20.070
Yeah, so the script's
back at my place

01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:22.865
-if you wanna come read it.
-So this is really fun.

01:11:22.865 --> 01:11:26.285
Um, I might-- I'm gonna go to
the bathroom first before that.

01:11:26.286 --> 01:11:29.289
-Lovely invite, thank you.
-We can go right now.

01:11:29.288 --> 01:11:31.582
-I'm actually
right around the corner.
-Um... yeah.

01:11:31.582 --> 01:11:33.125
You know, uh,
I could play the lead or,

01:11:33.126 --> 01:11:34.961
-or you could play the lead.
-Yep.

01:11:34.961 --> 01:11:38.173
-It's sort of a strong
female heroine.
-Yep.

01:11:38.172 --> 01:11:40.507
And, you know, we're thinking...

01:11:44.429 --> 01:11:46.139
Hello, hello, hello.

01:11:46.139 --> 01:11:49.309
I only got about five,
so let's keep 'em comin'.

01:11:49.309 --> 01:11:51.102
Hey, hey, yeah, um,
okay, um,

01:11:51.101 --> 01:11:52.436
so who paid for dinner?

01:11:52.436 --> 01:11:54.146
He did, but I did offer
to split,

01:11:54.146 --> 01:11:55.939
and then he insisted
on doing it,

01:11:55.939 --> 01:11:57.691
so I was like, "Whatever,
this is terrible anyway."

01:11:57.692 --> 01:11:59.527
Will you ever see him
again?

01:11:59.527 --> 01:12:01.321
You know, I like to go into
these things open-minded.

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.697
You know, if it goes well,
it goes well, but--

01:12:03.698 --> 01:12:05.241
Look, we all know
dating sucks,

01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:06.450
but wouldn't you just rather
be with Milo

01:12:06.451 --> 01:12:07.952
than keep this up?

01:12:11.081 --> 01:12:14.751
Is this an interview or is it
a therapy session?

01:12:14.751 --> 01:12:16.961
-Thank you so much, goodnight.

01:14:40.979 --> 01:14:43.816
So, Milo, you just got
your heart broken.

01:14:43.817 --> 01:14:46.986
How are you feeling?
What's going through your mind
right now?

01:14:46.985 --> 01:14:49.697
Uh, thanks for having me,
I'm really excited to be here.

01:14:49.698 --> 01:14:52.325
I am completely dead inside.

01:14:52.324 --> 01:14:54.743
I feel nothing.

01:14:54.743 --> 01:14:57.996
I feel like a no one, a nobody.

01:14:57.997 --> 01:15:01.584
I haven't showered
in a long time.

01:15:01.583 --> 01:15:03.877
Wow, that's amazing!

01:15:03.877 --> 01:15:07.006
Everybody, give it up
for this guy, he's so good.

01:15:07.006 --> 01:15:10.300
So are you wondering why maybe
the breakup happened?

01:15:10.301 --> 01:15:11.803
Do you think it's something
that you said

01:15:11.802 --> 01:15:13.512
or maybe something
that you didn't say

01:15:13.512 --> 01:15:16.515
or are you just totally broken
as a human being?

01:15:16.515 --> 01:15:19.685
I'm sort of like a cracked
iPhone screen right now.

01:15:19.685 --> 01:15:24.148
Yeah, you could fix me,
but it's probably best to just
upgrade to the next

01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:26.693
and better thing.

01:15:26.693 --> 01:15:29.654
All right, everybody,
that's all the time
that we have.

01:15:29.654 --> 01:15:31.406
Give it up again for Milo.

01:15:31.405 --> 01:15:34.825
He's so good, he's so funny,
isn't he great?

01:15:34.826 --> 01:15:35.952
Isn't he amazing?

01:15:35.952 --> 01:15:38.163
Isn't he great?

01:15:38.162 --> 01:15:39.455
Isn't he so good?

01:15:39.456 --> 01:15:42.250
Milo's so great, he's so good!

01:15:42.250 --> 01:15:43.250
Isn't he great?

01:15:43.251 --> 01:15:44.711
Isn't he amazing?

01:15:44.711 --> 01:15:46.171
Isn't he great?

01:15:46.171 --> 01:15:48.048
Isn't he amazing,
isn't he so good?

01:15:48.047 --> 01:15:49.173
Such a good catch.

01:15:49.173 --> 01:15:51.508
So funny, so good, so funny.

01:15:51.509 --> 01:15:55.096
You're strong, you care,
you're a catch, you're humble.

01:15:55.095 --> 01:15:56.638
You're-- you're
underappreciated.

01:15:56.639 --> 01:16:01.269
You, um...
You're trying.

01:16:01.269 --> 01:16:05.732
You're trying, you're trying,
you're, um...

01:16:07.024 --> 01:16:08.942
Ugh, I love New York.

01:16:08.943 --> 01:16:10.487
The only place where you can get
toilet paper,

01:16:10.487 --> 01:16:11.738
a toothbrush, and a turkey
bacon sandwich

01:16:11.738 --> 01:16:13.656
all in one place.

01:16:13.655 --> 01:16:17.159
This is a decent one,
but I really like a "bougdega"

01:16:17.159 --> 01:16:19.203
-instead of just a plain bodega.
- Oh, no.

01:16:19.203 --> 01:16:21.246
-You know what I'm sayin'?
-This is, this is New York.

01:16:21.247 --> 01:16:22.916
-This has everything.
-Yes, I know the rent
is gonna go up,

01:16:22.916 --> 01:16:25.126
but the gluten-free pasta
is kind of worth it.

01:16:25.126 --> 01:16:26.544
Yeah, but I wanna see
a cat.

01:16:26.543 --> 01:16:28.671
Oh, planning a wedding
is so stressful!

01:16:28.671 --> 01:16:31.298
Come on, man, I don't know
why you're so stressed
about this.

01:16:31.298 --> 01:16:33.342
You're getting married
to the love of your life.

01:16:33.342 --> 01:16:35.219
Didn't you get
like a wedding planner
or something like that?

01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:36.721
No, do you know how much
they cost?

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:39.056
I watch a lot of wedding
videos on YouTube,

01:16:39.056 --> 01:16:42.142
I could do it for like 800.
But I do like a minimal fare
sort of thing.

01:16:42.143 --> 01:16:44.854
-Yeah, thank you, thank you.
-Small invite list.

01:16:44.854 --> 01:16:47.732
an article
Which is good, because I read
We're doing it together!

01:16:47.731 --> 01:16:49.900
that said that couples
that plan together
stay together.

01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:51.026
What was that, a late daily?

01:16:51.027 --> 01:16:53.988
No, it was a meme on Instagram.

01:16:53.988 --> 01:16:55.657
How do you know that she's
the one?

01:16:55.657 --> 01:16:56.658
Jessie.

01:16:57.867 --> 01:16:59.452
Oh, I don't know.

01:17:00.578 --> 01:17:03.039
I guess I don't think about it.

01:17:03.038 --> 01:17:06.500
I guess we both just don't
overthink it.

01:17:06.501 --> 01:17:07.585
Well, what if you're
in a relationship

01:17:07.585 --> 01:17:09.629
and you're both like prone

01:17:09.628 --> 01:17:11.964
to overthinking things, then?

01:17:11.965 --> 01:17:13.466
If you need to get over
this girl,

01:17:13.466 --> 01:17:15.010
you need to delete
all the apps, okay?

01:17:15.010 --> 01:17:17.220
No Venmo, no Instagram.
No Twitter, none of it.

01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:18.888
Because if you don't, you'll be
getting into this space,

01:17:18.887 --> 01:17:20.681
which is like this weird
spiral depression

01:17:20.681 --> 01:17:22.808
Where you become very annoying
and a hypochondriac.

01:17:22.809 --> 01:17:25.895
-Did I tell you
that I found a lump?
-Where'd you find a lump?

01:17:25.895 --> 01:17:27.689
-Right there.
-That's your Adam's apple.

01:17:27.689 --> 01:17:29.065
That's not what
the internet said.

01:17:29.064 --> 01:17:30.816
-So you're gonna reach out?
-No.

01:17:30.817 --> 01:17:32.485
That would just make her mad,
so I'm not gonna do it.

01:17:32.484 --> 01:17:34.153
I'm just gonna fall back,
give her her space.

01:17:34.154 --> 01:17:35.321
-That's it.
-Really?

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:36.989
No grand romantic gesture?

01:17:36.989 --> 01:17:39.283
That stuff is the
take-me-back-culture thing.

01:17:39.283 --> 01:17:41.326
No, that's toxic,
it's a disease,

01:17:41.327 --> 01:17:43.246
and I'm gonna be the cure,

01:17:43.246 --> 01:17:45.040
even if that means I never get
to tell her that I love her.

01:17:45.039 --> 01:17:46.498
Right, you've told her
that you love her.

01:17:46.498 --> 01:17:47.541
Yeah, but I mean tell her
I love her

01:17:47.542 --> 01:17:49.336
and mean it, you know?

01:17:49.336 --> 01:17:50.795
Like, I love you.

01:17:50.795 --> 01:17:53.173
Like,
like-- what's that?

01:17:53.172 --> 01:17:55.632
-Incense, Jessie loves it.

01:17:55.632 --> 01:17:57.509
She likes bodega incense?

01:17:58.845 --> 01:18:00.680
Wendy cherished New York

01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:02.932
for its endless encounters
with the people you love

01:18:02.931 --> 01:18:05.142
and the places you learn
to love them.

01:18:33.003 --> 01:18:34.004
Sir.

01:18:37.509 --> 01:18:39.719
By now, you've probably
figured out

01:18:39.719 --> 01:18:43.139
that I am that soothing,
old voice you've been hearing

01:18:43.139 --> 01:18:45.809
holding your hand through
this tale of commitment.

01:18:45.809 --> 01:18:48.895
Did I mention that I also
moonlight as a voice-over
artist?

01:18:48.895 --> 01:18:51.481
-Hang on.

01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:53.691
-Wendy!
-Hey!

01:18:53.692 --> 01:18:56.444
-Hi!
-Cole, what are you doing here?

01:18:56.444 --> 01:18:58.363
-My job.
-Oh, wow.

01:18:59.238 --> 01:19:00.239
What's up?

01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:03.659
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm great.

01:19:03.659 --> 01:19:05.494
I'm great, I'm not here
to see Milo. What?

01:19:05.494 --> 01:19:07.538
-What?
-Who said that?

01:19:07.538 --> 01:19:12.084
No, no, I'm here to--
to go to a meeting.

01:19:12.085 --> 01:19:14.421
-I'm here to go to a meeting,
a meeting.
-Oh, here.

01:19:14.421 --> 01:19:17.298
No, no, no, no, no,
just in the area.

01:19:17.798 --> 01:19:20.634
It's this way.
Um...  It's this way.

01:19:20.635 --> 01:19:22.470
-Okay.
-So bye.

01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:23.930
-Bye.
-Bye.

01:19:27.016 --> 01:19:30.561
I love a good New York
love story.

01:19:30.561 --> 01:19:32.604
The city, you know,
it's one of the only places

01:19:32.604 --> 01:19:34.023
where you could--

01:19:35.108 --> 01:19:36.526
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:19:36.525 --> 01:19:37.943
-Um...
-What's up?

01:19:37.944 --> 01:19:40.655
Just a quick question.
It's nice.

01:19:40.654 --> 01:19:44.575
Um, is Milo, uh, upstairs?

01:19:45.618 --> 01:19:47.328
Yeah, nope.

01:19:47.328 --> 01:19:49.164
I don't think so.

01:19:49.163 --> 01:19:50.998
Oh, cool. Cool. Uh...

01:19:50.998 --> 01:19:52.958
Did he maybe say
when he was gonna be back?

01:19:52.958 --> 01:19:54.710
If he's maybe gonna be gone
all night

01:19:54.711 --> 01:19:56.963
or just like five more minutes?

01:19:56.962 --> 01:19:58.797
-Wendy.
-Right.

01:19:58.797 --> 01:20:00.758
-I hate to be the one
to tell you this.
-Okay.

01:20:00.759 --> 01:20:03.261
I think he's seeing someone.

01:20:07.556 --> 01:20:08.557
Okay.

01:20:09.934 --> 01:20:10.935
Okay.

01:20:12.354 --> 01:20:13.438
I'll see you.

01:20:14.773 --> 01:20:16.608
I'll see you, Wendy.

01:20:18.318 --> 01:20:21.696
Little did she know that Milo
wasn't seeing anybody

01:20:21.695 --> 01:20:24.990
and was, in fact,
painfully single.

01:20:24.990 --> 01:20:27.701
And where better to doubt
your own singlehood

01:20:27.702 --> 01:20:29.788
than under holy matrimony

01:20:29.787 --> 01:20:31.914
at the very bar
in which they met,

01:20:31.914 --> 01:20:34.166
where love filled the air--

01:20:34.167 --> 01:20:37.337
the wedding of Hank and Jessie.

01:20:37.337 --> 01:20:39.631
I'm not sweaty,
it's just really hot.

01:20:39.631 --> 01:20:41.049
Okay, I'm nervous, I'm nervous,
I'm nervous.

01:20:41.048 --> 01:20:43.217
Uh, you're gonna
do great, man.

01:20:43.217 --> 01:20:44.927
How are you so calm?

01:20:44.927 --> 01:20:47.179
Of course I'm calm.

01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:49.432
I'm marrying
the love of my life.

01:20:49.431 --> 01:20:50.933
-I'm proud of you, man.
-Thanks.

01:20:50.934 --> 01:20:52.602
I'm so proud of you.
I really am.

01:20:52.601 --> 01:20:53.936
So what are you gonna say
to her?

01:20:53.936 --> 01:20:55.604
-Who?
-Don't "who" me.

01:20:55.604 --> 01:20:57.106
I don't know
who you're talking about.

01:20:57.106 --> 01:20:58.107
I love you.

01:20:59.192 --> 01:21:01.861
-Bring it in.
-Mm. Thanks.

01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:04.071
And you are not an ugly
Jon Hamm, I take it back.

01:21:04.072 --> 01:21:05.615
You are a hot Jon Hamm.

01:22:14.184 --> 01:22:16.019
Everyone, please take
your seats.

01:22:18.479 --> 01:22:20.022
The bride and groom would like
to share their vows

01:22:20.023 --> 01:22:22.901
with us tonight
and with each other.

01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:24.985
-Jessie.
-Yeah.

01:22:24.985 --> 01:22:27.821
The first day that I saw you,
I pointed at you

01:22:27.822 --> 01:22:30.200
and said, "I am going to marry
that girl."

01:22:30.199 --> 01:22:32.159
-I know.

01:22:32.159 --> 01:22:34.036
-Jess, it's my vows.
-Okay, sorry.

01:22:34.037 --> 01:22:35.663
-Okay.
-You go.

01:22:35.662 --> 01:22:37.790
Mm, no, stop Not yet!
Stop, don't do it yet.

01:22:37.791 --> 01:22:39.834
Sorry.

01:22:39.833 --> 01:22:41.293
-Start over.
-Okay.

01:22:41.293 --> 01:22:43.128
-Mm-hmm.
-First day that happened.

01:22:43.128 --> 01:22:45.214
-Yes.
-I was doing it as a joke.

01:22:45.215 --> 01:22:47.884
-Uh-huh.
-But you have kept me laughing
ever since.

01:22:47.884 --> 01:22:50.595
-Mm-hmm.
-I promise to be
your best friend

01:22:50.595 --> 01:22:52.931
and to love you always.
I love you.

01:22:52.930 --> 01:22:54.598
I love you.

01:22:54.599 --> 01:22:57.435
Hank, a lot of people
say that cheesy thing

01:22:57.435 --> 01:22:59.688
where they're like,
"I don't always like you,
but I love you,"

01:22:59.688 --> 01:23:01.773
but I like you and I love you.

01:23:01.773 --> 01:23:05.151
And I don't even care
that you always fall asleep

01:23:05.150 --> 01:23:07.069
the second we pick a movie,

01:23:07.069 --> 01:23:08.779
and I don't care that sometimes

01:23:08.779 --> 01:23:10.572
you only respond "ha-ha"
to my texts

01:23:10.573 --> 01:23:13.201
and don't add additional info.

01:23:13.201 --> 01:23:15.286
And I really love that we both
like that meme

01:23:15.286 --> 01:23:18.707
about birds that look
like old ladies wearing hats.

01:23:18.707 --> 01:23:20.333
And I just love you so much

01:23:20.332 --> 01:23:22.835
and I'm the luckiest girl
in the world

01:23:22.836 --> 01:23:24.713
that you love me, too.

01:23:24.712 --> 01:23:26.296
Is that good?

01:23:26.296 --> 01:23:27.506
You like that shit?

01:23:30.885 --> 01:23:32.095
Ooh!

01:23:34.055 --> 01:23:35.682
Fashion moment.

01:23:35.681 --> 01:23:37.349
-Same time.
-At same time?

01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:40.979
-Okay.
-One, two, three.

01:23:40.979 --> 01:23:42.939
You may now kiss the bride.

01:23:47.652 --> 01:23:50.030

Do you not want

01:25:47.479 --> 01:25:48.981
without the emotional
attachment?

01:25:48.981 --> 01:25:50.524
I want that,
but I also want

01:25:50.524 --> 01:25:51.775
the emotional attachment.

01:25:51.775 --> 01:25:53.068
The words "I love you,"

01:25:53.069 --> 01:25:54.154
in that order,

01:25:54.154 --> 01:25:55.363
cannot be shared

01:25:55.363 --> 01:25:56.906
with one party to the other.

01:25:56.905 --> 01:25:58.407
You just gotta pick a flavor

01:25:58.408 --> 01:25:59.993
and then just go
with that flavor.

01:25:59.993 --> 01:26:02.328
I care about you
so much, Milo.

01:26:02.328 --> 01:26:03.830
Will I see you again?

01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:10.837
-Yeah.

01:26:14.716 --> 01:26:16.718
-Hello. Hey, hey, what's up?
-Hi, hi.

01:26:16.717 --> 01:26:17.968
-How's it going?

01:26:21.264 --> 01:26:22.932
I really miss you.

01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:26.268
I really miss you.

01:26:27.311 --> 01:26:32.733
And I would really like it
if you were back in my life.

01:26:35.110 --> 01:26:37.988
I'd like to be back
in your life, too.

01:26:37.988 --> 01:26:43.077
And I promise I'm done trying
other flavors.

01:26:44.287 --> 01:26:45.622
I just want one.

01:26:49.250 --> 01:26:51.002
I love you so much.

01:26:53.337 --> 01:26:54.463
I love you, too.

01:27:09.604 --> 01:27:12.273
Once upon a time,

01:27:12.273 --> 01:27:15.568
in a magical kingdom
known as New York City,

01:27:15.568 --> 01:27:19.322
there lived a happily married
couple.

01:27:19.322 --> 01:27:23.785
Then there was Milo and Wendy
or Wendy and Milo.

01:27:23.784 --> 01:27:27.413
Maybe it was vows,
the ubiquitous feeling
of romance,

01:27:27.413 --> 01:27:29.331
or the magic of Manhattan,

01:27:29.332 --> 01:27:33.086
but they finally had
true love's kiss,

01:27:33.086 --> 01:27:35.839
and the heartbroken
learned to love again.

01:27:37.881 --> 01:27:39.758
Their thread began again

01:27:39.759 --> 01:27:43.263
and they finally dated
happily ever after.

01:27:47.225 --> 01:27:49.811
For a few more months.
