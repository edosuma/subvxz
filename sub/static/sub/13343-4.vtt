WEBVTT

00:06.607 --> 00:10.178
Why should he doubt it?
Why should I hide my regard?

00:10.278 --> 00:11.645
No particular reason.
Only that we know...

00:11.745 --> 00:13.681
Why are we
watching this?

00:13.781 --> 00:15.249
It was nominated
for seven Oscars.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.418
I feel I know
Mr. Willoughby already.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.253
I don't care.
If one of these women
doesn't take her shirt off

00:19.353 --> 00:21.589
in the next five minutes,
I'm switching it off.

00:23.291 --> 00:25.659
Hang on, wait.
Pause the film, mate.

00:27.027 --> 00:27.928
Where you off to
dressed like this?

00:28.028 --> 00:30.431
Grocery shopping?

00:30.531 --> 00:32.500
Me and the girls
are going to Hades.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.502
I thought that was a gay club.
Why are you going to a gay club?

00:34.602 --> 00:36.470
Attractive women
prefer gay clubs

00:36.570 --> 00:38.306
so there's not
a bunch of guys there

00:38.406 --> 00:40.208
competing
to get our numbers.

00:40.308 --> 00:42.009
There's no competition?

00:42.110 --> 00:43.911
Give me five minutes
to get changed.

00:44.011 --> 00:45.546
- No, no, you're not coming.
- Oh, come on.

00:45.646 --> 00:46.814
No.

00:46.914 --> 00:48.682
Oh, I'll give you
my Wi-Fi code.

00:48.782 --> 00:51.219
You have
three minutes.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.122
What about movie night?

00:54.222 --> 00:55.323
Well, just stay and, you know,
finish watching the film.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.325
And, you know,
whatever you want.

00:57.425 --> 00:59.493
- Use the hot tub if
you like. All right?
- Okay.

00:59.593 --> 01:02.663
Don't heat it up, though,
'cause it honestly costs
a fortune.

01:02.763 --> 01:04.765
Thanks.

01:04.865 --> 01:08.702
* Just a little boy lost
looking for a lamb *

01:08.802 --> 01:11.038
* In the all-night city

01:11.139 --> 01:16.277
* Living in
his lonely limousine *

01:16.377 --> 01:19.513
* And though
he never has to worry *

01:19.613 --> 01:23.117
* He's the only one
and only one *

01:23.217 --> 01:24.718
* He's ever gonna need

01:24.818 --> 01:28.189
* Absolutely,
he's in definite need *

01:28.289 --> 01:32.059
* Ooh, maybe we've been
alone too long *

01:32.160 --> 01:35.263
* You don't want
to be lonely *

01:35.363 --> 01:38.399
* Maybe we've been alone
too long *

01:38.499 --> 01:42.403
* You don't want
to be lonely. *

01:45.273 --> 01:46.874
( dance music playing )

01:56.750 --> 02:00.053
If you need me,
I'll be on the dance floor.

02:00.154 --> 02:01.655
Enjoy.

02:04.658 --> 02:07.428
- Hi.
- Hello.

02:07.528 --> 02:08.596
( giggling )

02:08.696 --> 02:10.063
Hi.

02:10.164 --> 02:13.133
Wow, you look so great.
I love your dress.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.968
Oh, it's vintage.

02:15.068 --> 02:16.637
Yeah, I thought
it looked old.

02:16.737 --> 02:19.106
And you're so tan.

02:19.207 --> 02:20.741
Is she not
the most tan?

02:20.841 --> 02:22.543
- Oh, my goodness.
- Thanks.

02:22.643 --> 02:25.313
Are you
still walking
dogs for money?

02:25.413 --> 02:27.715
No.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.750
No? It's a shame
because I really,
really need someone.

02:31.852 --> 02:32.753
Margo.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.688
Amelia,
hello, sweetie.

02:34.788 --> 02:37.024
Oh, how fresh you look.
I'm seeing you Saturday,
right?

02:37.124 --> 02:38.826
Of course, of course.

02:38.926 --> 02:40.494
Great, see you then.

02:41.962 --> 02:43.731
I love her.
Do you know Margo?

02:43.831 --> 02:45.499
Love her.

02:45.599 --> 02:48.636
This woman throws
the best dinner parties
in Los Angeles.

02:48.736 --> 02:49.803
Best.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.372
They're always
packed with--

02:51.472 --> 02:53.974
( together )
Tastemakers, groundbreakers.

02:54.074 --> 02:56.009
Everything.

02:56.109 --> 02:57.811
So then you're going
on Saturday?

02:57.911 --> 02:59.713
Saturday?

02:59.813 --> 03:02.049
Yeah, I didn't see your
name on the e-mail list.

03:02.149 --> 03:03.617
Satur--
this Saturday?

03:03.717 --> 03:04.618
Yes.

03:04.718 --> 03:07.321
Um, yeah, if poss.
I'm super busy.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.523
- Girl: Who isn't?
- Yeah.

03:11.425 --> 03:13.494
( music continues )

03:15.596 --> 03:17.197
( yelps )

03:20.334 --> 03:21.902
Oh, yeah, yeah.

03:41.422 --> 03:44.057
- What are you doing?
- He was allowed to do it.

03:44.157 --> 03:46.226
What-- what are
the rules?

03:46.327 --> 03:48.929
Did you see"The Gladiator"?

03:49.029 --> 03:50.964
( speaking softly )

03:51.064 --> 03:53.401
Love that.
It's the feathers--

03:53.501 --> 03:54.668
Margo?

03:54.768 --> 03:56.370
Oh, hi.

03:56.470 --> 03:59.072
- Everyone,
this is Jessica.
- Hi.

03:59.172 --> 04:00.408
We campaigned
for Obama together.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.576
- How are you?
- Oh, I'm really good.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.177
Let's go.
All the girls here
are stuck up.

04:04.278 --> 04:06.447
Fuck off.
Margo...

04:06.547 --> 04:08.616
I love, love
your skirt.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.651
- Is it one of yours?
- I wish.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.953
Marc Jacobs
loaned it to me.
I never gave it back.

04:15.589 --> 04:19.360
Oh, my God,
how I miss your stories.

04:19.460 --> 04:22.363
I'd love to have you over
for dinner sometime.

04:22.463 --> 04:24.365
- We could catch up.
- That sounds fun.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.269
How about Saturday?

04:29.370 --> 04:32.573
I can't do Saturday, honey.
Sorry.

04:35.443 --> 04:39.613
Shoot, you know,
because Saturday is really
the only day that I have.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.415
Actually, I'm having a little
dinner at my house Saturday.

04:41.515 --> 04:42.850
Why don't you come by?

04:42.950 --> 04:46.153
Oh, you're having a dinner
on Saturday? Oh.

04:46.253 --> 04:47.287
( music continues )

04:47.388 --> 04:48.989
My goodness.

04:49.089 --> 04:50.991
How tall are you?

04:51.091 --> 04:53.494
Just so you know,
I'm not gay, so nothing's
gonna happen there.

04:53.594 --> 04:54.962
I wasn't hitting on you.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.730
Sure.

04:58.466 --> 05:00.501
Oh, my God.
There you are.

05:01.602 --> 05:04.171
- Woman: Hi.
- Mwah.

05:04.271 --> 05:06.006
Mwah.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.610
Six-foot-seven.
I'm sorry?

05:09.710 --> 05:11.779
Sorry, you asked
about my height.
Six-foot-seven.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.347
Right, right.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.716
Sorry if I seemed
a bit curt.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.317
It's just that sometimes
if I think someone's
making fun of my height,

05:17.418 --> 05:19.186
I get a little bit--
you know what I mean?

05:19.286 --> 05:22.322
I meant no offense.
I love how tall you are.

05:22.423 --> 05:23.924
Oh, appreciate it.
My name's Stuart by the way.

05:24.024 --> 05:24.925
- Andy.
- Nice to meet you.

05:25.025 --> 05:26.827
- Justin.
- Hello.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.729
- And these ladies are?
- Oh, these are some of
our best friends.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.331
This is Candice
and Melanie and Heidi.

05:31.432 --> 05:34.668
- Hello, ladies.
- Melanie has the
best tits ever.

05:34.768 --> 05:35.803
Feel them.

05:35.903 --> 05:37.237
Pardon me?

05:37.337 --> 05:41.074
- I said, "Feel them."
- Melanie: Go ahead.

05:41.174 --> 05:45.546
- Oh, my God, what is this
that you're wearing?
- Okay.

05:45.646 --> 05:48.982
Whatever this is
is so fucking offensive,
I love it.

05:49.082 --> 05:50.250
I wanna be
buried in that.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.685
Thank you, yeah.
I'm actually--

05:51.785 --> 05:53.687
I'm inspired a lot
by the fashions of Adrien Brody.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.122
Yeah, well,
who isn't, right?

05:55.222 --> 05:56.457
Um, sorry, you wanted
me to feel--

05:56.557 --> 05:58.225
- Gotta run.
- Bye.

05:58.325 --> 06:01.228
Oh, where are they going?

06:01.328 --> 06:02.696
Forget them.
They're skanks.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.665
They will fuck
anything that moves.

06:04.765 --> 06:07.200
Will they?

06:07.300 --> 06:08.969
If you're into models,
talk to this guy.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.504
He runs
a modeling agency.

06:10.604 --> 06:12.806
You run an agency?

06:12.906 --> 06:14.141
- Okay, I'm ready to go.
- Fuck off.

06:14.241 --> 06:15.342
You run
a modeling agency?

06:15.443 --> 06:16.610
I'm sorry,
I love that dress.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.378
Your tits
look amazing in it.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.547
- Thank you.
- Can I feel them?

06:19.647 --> 06:20.781
- Let him feel them.
- Okay.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.383
Do you sort of
own the agency?

06:23.484 --> 06:24.718
Or is it like--
you own it.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.386
Andy, Andy.
These are better
than I imagined.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.121
- You've gotta feel them.
- Oh, here I come.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.257
Here we go--
ooh!

06:30.357 --> 06:32.292
Stuart, feel them.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.293
Sure.
All right.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.662
So you--

06:34.762 --> 06:36.497
- We should get going, Andy.
- Oh, already?

06:36.597 --> 06:38.165
- Great meeting you guys.
- Yeah.

06:38.265 --> 06:39.399
Bye, everyone.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.568
What's the name
of the agency?

06:40.668 --> 06:42.369
Bye, everyone.
Margo, Saturday.

06:42.470 --> 06:44.304
See you then,
sweetie.

06:44.404 --> 06:47.441
Yeah, see you Saturday,
Margo.

06:47.541 --> 06:50.944
What's happening
on Saturday?

07:04.191 --> 07:05.459
I'm going to leave
the price on

07:05.559 --> 07:07.160
so they know how much
we've spent.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.597
No, we're not
doing that again.

07:09.697 --> 07:11.799
- Yes, I spent 12.99 on it.
- No, we're not doing that.

07:11.899 --> 07:14.702
Also, you better be
on your best behavior
tonight because

07:14.802 --> 07:17.270
this party is going to be
filled with tastemakers

07:17.370 --> 07:19.139
and groundbreakers.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.208
Oh, wow, are there
going to be trailblazers
or trendsetters there?

07:21.308 --> 07:23.076
Okay, you
are disinvited.

07:23.176 --> 07:25.045
- Really, that's it?
Happens that quickly?
- Yeah, yeah.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.346
- Happens fast.
- Yeah?

07:26.446 --> 07:27.715
You know what, though?
Seriously, don't--

07:27.815 --> 07:29.750
don't push it tonight.
Don't try too hard.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.785
You don't need to teach me
lessons, love, all right?

07:31.885 --> 07:33.120
I know how to charm
gay people.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.254
I got a lot
of gay friends.

07:34.354 --> 07:35.455
- Oh, you do?
- Yeah.

07:35.556 --> 07:36.857
Huh. Name three.

07:36.957 --> 07:37.991
Andy.

07:38.091 --> 07:40.327
The guy you met at the club
is your friend?

07:40.427 --> 07:42.429
I wouldn't say a good friend,
but I'd certainly consider
him a pal, yeah.

07:42.530 --> 07:44.231
Okay, a second?

07:44.331 --> 07:46.333
I think my aunt
might be a lesbian.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.602
- Your aunt?
- Yeah. She certainly
dresses like one.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.738
Cool. And then
a third one?

07:50.838 --> 07:53.440
The woman that my aunt's
been living with for
the last 20 years.

07:53.541 --> 07:54.708
"Auntie Maureen."

07:54.808 --> 07:57.377
Oh, great.
Give me that wine.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.478
I'm gonna put it
in a gift bag.

07:58.579 --> 07:59.880
( doorbell rings )

07:59.980 --> 08:03.651
- What did you do,
order a cab?
- No.

08:03.751 --> 08:04.985
- Hey.
- Hello.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.855
Look, someone dressed up
for movie night.

08:07.955 --> 08:10.991
Oh, wait.

08:11.091 --> 08:13.326
I'm sorry, man.
I comp-- I completely
forgot about movie night.

08:13.426 --> 08:15.262
Oh, really?

08:15.362 --> 08:17.497
Yeah. I'm sorry,
I've got-- we're
going to a dinner party.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.567
Can you
get out of it?

08:19.667 --> 08:22.502
I can't miss it, mate.
There's a guy there and he
runs a modeling agency.

08:22.603 --> 08:25.573
If I get in with him,
he can fix me up with models.

08:25.673 --> 08:27.174
You know that's
one of my dreams.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.142
So I--
I woulda made other plans.
That's all.

08:29.242 --> 08:32.112
- I know--
- You've done this to me
two times in a row.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.447
I know, I know, I know.
But why don't you-- look,

08:34.548 --> 08:37.250
why don't you stay here, man?
You can watch the movies
on the big-screen TV.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.419
Just chill out.
Put the surround sound
on and everything.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.688
It's gotta be better
than the motel, right?

08:40.788 --> 08:42.790
No, it is, it is.
You're right.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.257
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Okay.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.425
I'm sorry, man.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.160
- Okay, gotta go.
- All right.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.196
- See you later.
- Have fun.

08:49.296 --> 08:50.964
And if you get hungry,
there's some Chinese food
in the fridge.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.600
- Great.
- Don't eat it, obviously,

08:52.700 --> 08:54.101
'cause I'm gonna
have that tomorrow,

08:54.201 --> 08:56.103
but the number
is on the side
of the place,

08:56.203 --> 08:58.138
so just give 'em a ring.
They'll deliver.
All right?

08:58.238 --> 08:59.973
See you, man.

09:04.511 --> 09:06.747
( music, voices talking
within )

09:08.381 --> 09:09.883
Ah, hello.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.885
- Welcome.
- Hi. I brought you some wine.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.453
- Oh, how sweet--
- We did. It was
from both of us.

09:13.553 --> 09:14.688
Yeah, this is my
good friend Stuart.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.256
- Hello, Stuart.
- Hello.

09:16.356 --> 09:18.325
- What a beautiful place
you have.
- Thank you.

09:18.425 --> 09:21.394
Thank you.
Everyone, I'd like you
to meet Stuart and Jessica.

09:21.494 --> 09:23.430
You made it.

09:23.530 --> 09:25.265
I was invited.

09:25.365 --> 09:27.234
Andy, Stuart.

09:27.334 --> 09:28.936
Yes, yes, from the club.

09:29.036 --> 09:32.072
Good to see you.
Oh-- hey. Oh.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.741
Oh, do you...

09:33.841 --> 09:35.175
Good to see you again.

09:35.275 --> 09:36.409
Sorry, what's
your name again?

09:36.509 --> 09:37.577
Oh, this is Armand,
my boyfriend.

09:37.678 --> 09:38.979
Good to meet you.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.413
Jessica, come here.
Lovely gay couple here.

09:40.513 --> 09:41.982
- Oh, hello. Hi.
- Hi.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.717
- And this chap
here as well.
- Hi.

09:43.817 --> 09:46.920
Well, I think it's time
for a toast. A toast, everyone.

09:47.020 --> 09:50.223
To Margo.
Thank you for welcoming
us to your home.

09:50.323 --> 09:53.627
And to an evening
of good conversation
and better friends.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.095
Guests:
Aww.

09:55.195 --> 09:59.633
And a world where people
of all shapes and sizes,

09:59.733 --> 10:01.669
colors, creeds,
persuasions

10:01.769 --> 10:04.004
can live in harmony.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.338
- Guests: Cheers.
- Wait, hang on.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.141
Without fear

10:08.241 --> 10:09.810
of discrimination

10:09.910 --> 10:12.045
or religious intolerance
towards those

10:12.145 --> 10:14.848
who do not choose
who they love--

10:14.948 --> 10:17.017
I'm so sorry I'm late.

10:17.117 --> 10:20.253
I passed a billboard with
Channing Tatum on it and
I had to pull over.

10:20.353 --> 10:21.621
( laughter )

10:21.722 --> 10:23.456
Yep, not quite the time
for humor, though,

10:23.556 --> 10:25.125
'cause we're just
in the middle of a toast.

10:25.225 --> 10:26.994
- Oh, sorry.
- Yeah.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.429
To...

10:29.529 --> 10:31.498
uh...

10:31.598 --> 10:34.334
an end of prejudice.

10:34.434 --> 10:36.603
- Cheers.
- Guests: Cheers.

10:36.704 --> 10:38.338
I could never be accused
of prejudice.

10:38.438 --> 10:41.508
As we all know,
I went down on a Samoan
bartender once.

10:41.608 --> 10:42.943
( laughter )

10:43.043 --> 10:46.046
Good for you.
Good for you, mate.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.148
Margo has all of this
made from scratch.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.550
Woman:
Oh!

10:50.650 --> 10:52.052
Thank you.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.323
So, ladies, what do
you do for a living?

10:56.423 --> 10:58.425
- I am an actress.
- Ah.

10:58.525 --> 10:59.526
- I'm an actor.
- Ah.

10:59.626 --> 11:00.560
What about you?

11:00.660 --> 11:02.129
Runs a modeling agency.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.797
Well remembered.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.332
And Armand works
at "Vanity Fair."

11:05.432 --> 11:07.868
He's one of the editors
of the "Vanities" section.

11:07.968 --> 11:10.303
- Oh, really?
- I love that section.

11:10.403 --> 11:12.740
Now, what is
the "Vanities" section?
'Cause that sounds fascinating.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.474
I write profiles on
up-and-coming actresses.

11:14.574 --> 11:16.710
Andy:
He discovered Annie Hathaway
when she was nobody.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.812
Rachel McAdams
when she was nobody.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.613
Amy Adams when
she was nobody.

11:20.714 --> 11:23.350
Well, I'm a nobody.
Can I be in it?

11:23.450 --> 11:25.452
( laughter )

11:25.552 --> 11:28.288
Oh, I'm serious.
Put me in it.

11:28.388 --> 11:31.191
Well, I'm more of
a nobody than she is.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.392
Oh, definitely not.

11:32.492 --> 11:34.294
Armand, so,
"Vanity Fair."

11:34.394 --> 11:35.996
That must be
a great job.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.531
Yes, it's kinda like
my dream gig.

11:38.631 --> 11:40.768
I think it's great that
you're living your dream.
Can I say that?

11:40.868 --> 11:45.172
'Cause so many people,
you know, like you guys,

11:45.272 --> 11:46.206
never get the chance.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.442
There was a young chap
when I was at school, um,

11:49.542 --> 11:50.944
and he was bullied
mercilessly.

11:51.044 --> 11:54.081
Constantly.
We used to break his
bike and push him over

11:54.181 --> 11:55.615
and steal his little hat
and throw it back and stuff.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.485
And when he was
15 years old,

11:58.585 --> 12:01.654
he took an overdose
of pills.

12:01.755 --> 12:02.890
Killed himself.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.327
And I'm pretty certain
it's 'cause we all thought
he was gay.

12:17.637 --> 12:20.808
I'm sorry, I thought I was
invited to a dinner, not a wake.

12:20.908 --> 12:23.076
( laughter )

12:23.176 --> 12:25.612
Although that waiter
is giving me rigor mortis
in the crotch, so...

12:25.712 --> 12:29.682
( laughter )

12:29.783 --> 12:31.051
Margo:
I cannot control him.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.286
Margo, where's
the bathroom, please?

12:33.386 --> 12:35.956
- Oh, down the hall
to the right.
- Thank you.

12:36.056 --> 12:39.692
Wow, look at this place.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.761
The Pritch parlor
is super swank.

12:41.862 --> 12:44.297
Yeah.
So what movie
you want to watch?

12:44.397 --> 12:47.167
I got "Lincoln Lawyer,"
I got "Perfect Murder,"
I got loads of 'em. I got--

12:47.267 --> 12:49.502
Listen, Wade,
we could watch a movie,

12:49.602 --> 12:51.839
but we could
also teach Stuart
a little lesson

12:51.939 --> 12:53.706
for leaving you
in the lurch. Again.

12:53.807 --> 12:56.977
Yeah, but, you know,
Kives, he's got his
reasons. It's fine.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.311
I'm not talking about
anything crazy.

12:58.411 --> 12:59.312
No, I don't wanna.

12:59.412 --> 13:00.914
It's a little mischief.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.515
Show him he can't
treat you this way.
Right?

13:02.615 --> 13:04.284
I mean, I guess if
it's only mischief.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.219
Excellent.
Where's his bedroom?
Down here?

13:06.319 --> 13:07.254
Yeah.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.330
Kives:
Jesus.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.544
Jessica, how long
have you been acting?

13:31.644 --> 13:33.713
Oh, um, ten years.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.615
And have we seen you
in anything?

13:35.715 --> 13:40.287
Yes, I was actually the female
lead of an action film called
"White Venom Two."

13:40.387 --> 13:41.821
With Willem Dafoe.

13:41.922 --> 13:44.591
( guests murmur )

13:44.691 --> 13:46.693
And guess who was
in "White Venom" One?
Hello.

13:46.793 --> 13:48.761
Actually, it's funny.
That's how we met.

13:48.862 --> 13:51.564
We were both auditioning
for "White Venom" and
I got the part,

13:51.664 --> 13:53.967
and the movie made
a ton of money,

13:54.067 --> 13:55.802
and then--
so they wanted
to make a sequel

13:55.903 --> 13:56.970
and they asked me
to do it,

13:57.070 --> 13:58.638
but they wanted me
to do nudity

13:58.738 --> 14:01.641
and I felt
that it was a bit
exploitative, but Jess,

14:01.741 --> 14:05.712
no such qualms. She just jumped
straight in, whipped it out.
There she was. She did it.

14:05.812 --> 14:09.182
Yeah, well, most of
the nudity did get cut out

14:09.282 --> 14:12.819
- after the test screenings.
- Yeah.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.254
I just wish
it had gotten
a theatrical release.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.990
Oh, it did. Number one film
in Korea for six weeks.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.927
Yes, in Korea.
Uh, North or South?

14:20.027 --> 14:21.461
( laughing )

14:27.300 --> 14:29.136
( silent )

14:33.440 --> 14:36.176
Join us
for some coffee
in the lounge.

14:37.844 --> 14:40.447
Hey, hey, hey.

14:40.547 --> 14:41.881
I think I've been
judging the mood wrong.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.183
Oh, you think?

14:43.283 --> 14:44.717
Okay, there's no need
for sarcasm.

14:44.817 --> 14:46.053
What I've realized is,

14:46.153 --> 14:49.156
the gay fellas,
they love the outrageous jokes.

14:49.256 --> 14:51.124
So listen, I've been looking
a few up in the bathroom, okay.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.492
I just need you
at some point to just say,

14:52.592 --> 14:54.761
"Oh, you know, Stuart's
a hilarious gag man."

14:54.861 --> 14:57.397
- And I'll rattle a few off.
- Don't do jokes.
You're not funny.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.466
- I'm funny. What are
you talking about? I'm funny.
- You are not funny, okay?

14:59.566 --> 15:01.568
- I am funnier than you.
- When have you ever
said a funny thing?

15:01.668 --> 15:03.570
- I'm funny all the time.
- Come on, I gave you
my Wi-Fi code.

15:03.670 --> 15:04.871
- Ugh. Okay, fine.
- Thank you.

15:04.972 --> 15:06.306
You need to help
me out with something

15:06.406 --> 15:09.042
because Amelia
is all over Armand,

15:09.142 --> 15:11.311
trying to weasel her way
into "Vanity Fair."

15:11.411 --> 15:12.512
You haven't been
doing that yourself?

15:12.612 --> 15:14.247
- No.
- No? Okay.

15:14.347 --> 15:18.051
I mean, if he wants
to put me in the
"Vanities" section,

15:18.151 --> 15:19.987
- then that's
his prerogative.
- Sure.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.089
I just need you to,
sort of, compliment me.

15:22.189 --> 15:23.856
Just talk about my work.

15:23.957 --> 15:27.760
- Well, you better
laugh at my jokes.
- Okay, yeah, I will.

15:27.860 --> 15:31.198
Well, my agent always
tells me that you can't
look at Twitter.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.066
Guys, do you mind if I
interrupt for one second?

15:33.166 --> 15:34.667
I do apologize,
but, um,

15:34.767 --> 15:36.970
I would feel bad if I didn't
take this opportunity

15:37.070 --> 15:38.938
just to flag up
to you, Armand,

15:39.039 --> 15:42.609
that you really should
put Jessica in your magazine

15:42.709 --> 15:44.344
'cause she is
a great actress.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.213
Oh, Stuart,
you're embarrassing me.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.048
I know, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, but...

15:51.584 --> 15:53.820
Stuart,
tell us a joke.
He's hilarious.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.589
Ah, what do you call
two gay Irishmen?

15:58.258 --> 16:01.161
Patrick Fitzmichael,
and Michael Fitzpatrick.

16:02.996 --> 16:04.497
It's good to have
a bit of a laugh.

16:04.597 --> 16:06.166
Have some fun.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.700
I like you guys 'cause you
got a great sense of humor.

16:07.800 --> 16:08.801
That's what I love
about you dudes.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.203
You know what I mean?

16:10.303 --> 16:12.139
Did you-- sorry,
I'm trying to remember.

16:12.239 --> 16:13.940
When we were
in the club, did you
mention something about

16:14.041 --> 16:16.343
fixing me up
with a model?
Do you remember?

16:16.443 --> 16:18.111
- Oh, yeah, yeah,
the club.
- Oh.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.080
We were just talking
'cause you were

16:20.180 --> 16:22.649
in the agency and, you know,
I'm tall, they're tall.

16:22.749 --> 16:23.950
There you go.

16:24.051 --> 16:25.352
I should set--
I will set you up.

16:25.452 --> 16:26.753
- How about that?
- Thank you, I appreciate it.

16:26.853 --> 16:27.787
- Okay.
- Thank you, thank you.

16:27.887 --> 16:29.856
Maybe now.

16:29.956 --> 16:32.125
- Huh?
- Huh? I'm just saying,

16:32.225 --> 16:34.894
maybe we could
do it now.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.429
- Why not?
- Why not?

16:37.830 --> 16:40.467
Hey, Wade...

16:41.868 --> 16:43.770
Hope I didn't blink.

16:43.870 --> 16:46.773
Oh, yeah.

16:46.873 --> 16:49.309
Just a little delicious
hand soap.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.750
( snickers )

16:57.850 --> 17:01.321
No. no.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.456
No.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.058
Would you go ethnic?

17:05.158 --> 17:07.427
It's a good question.
Um...

17:07.527 --> 17:09.062
I think in the right
circumstances, I would, yeah.

17:09.162 --> 17:10.397
- Okay.
- Who've you got in mind?

17:10.497 --> 17:11.664
Well, I have a gorgeous
Vietnamese here.

17:11.764 --> 17:13.600
Keep talking.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.704
Oh, me love her
long ti--

17:17.804 --> 17:21.608
that's a lovely
looking girl.
Don't you think?

17:21.708 --> 17:24.377
- Yep. Sweet.
Very sweet face.
- Andy: Yeah?

17:24.477 --> 17:27.280
I was there for months doing
"West Side Story" actually,

17:27.380 --> 17:29.149
and it took every
little bit of willpower

17:29.249 --> 17:31.318
to not go in there and
just shove my face full--

17:31.418 --> 17:32.919
Okay, wait a minute,
you were in "West Side Story"?

17:33.019 --> 17:34.654
But you were
the understudy, right?

17:34.754 --> 17:37.690
That is correct.
I was the understudy
in London, and then

17:37.790 --> 17:40.059
on Broadway,
I was the lead.

17:40.160 --> 17:43.863
Listen, I saw this model
on a billboard

17:43.963 --> 17:46.866
on Hollywood Boulevard
and she's

17:46.966 --> 17:48.368
rather, sort of
won my heart.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.203
Justin:
Oh, my God,
that's Kimberly.

17:50.303 --> 17:52.038
Andy, text her right now,
see what she's doing.

17:52.139 --> 17:53.573
- I'm on it.
- She loves tall men.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.108
Oh, okay.
All right.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.310
Okay, "Hey, Kim,

17:57.410 --> 17:59.479
just met a great guy--"

17:59.579 --> 18:01.181
- Andy.
- Hang on, he's busy.

18:01.281 --> 18:03.216
- What is it?
- No, stay focused.
Come on.

18:03.316 --> 18:05.118
- Amelia was in
"West Side Story."
- It's...

18:05.218 --> 18:07.320
- Cool.
- Make her sing.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.356
No, I'm not
going to sing.

18:09.456 --> 18:10.857
It'll make me look like
the biggest show-off
in the world.

18:10.957 --> 18:12.359
- Yeah.
- No, it won't.

18:12.459 --> 18:13.326
Or will it?

18:13.426 --> 18:15.128
I would love
to hear something.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.063
- So would I, but let's get this
bloody message sent, shall we?
- Oh.

18:17.164 --> 18:20.533
Okay, fine,
I'll sing one song,
but one.

18:20.633 --> 18:21.668
Nice.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.470
Sent.

18:25.205 --> 18:30.577
* Hold my hand
and I'll take you there *

18:30.677 --> 18:33.180
* Somehow

18:33.280 --> 18:35.915
* Someday

18:36.015 --> 18:39.452
* Some...

18:39.552 --> 18:43.323
* Where.

18:43.423 --> 18:44.557
Sorry, I get emotional.

18:45.925 --> 18:46.959
Fantastic.

18:47.059 --> 18:48.361
Thank you.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.863
- Amazing. Amazing.
- Margo: Just fabulous.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.399
Thank you.

18:52.499 --> 18:55.134
Please-- oh, I'm sorry,
I sat right on you.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.336
Yeah, you did.

18:56.436 --> 18:57.570
- Armand: Gorgeous.
- Thank you.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.406
- That was wonderful.
- Thank you.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.608
I didn't realize
we were doing our
party pieces tonight.

19:01.708 --> 19:02.675
Should I do mine?

19:02.775 --> 19:03.610
Do you sing?

19:03.710 --> 19:06.813
No, I am actually
more of a dancer.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.481
Oh, what kind
of dance?

19:08.581 --> 19:10.149
Tap.

19:10.250 --> 19:14.287
Did you bring your tap shoes
to this party tonight?

19:14.387 --> 19:17.290
No. No.
But I can make some.

19:20.026 --> 19:21.861
Okay. It's been
a little while,

19:21.961 --> 19:24.497
so please be kind.

19:36.142 --> 19:38.211
( chuckles )

19:42.315 --> 19:43.616
( chuckles )

19:56.763 --> 19:58.531
Ow.

20:05.071 --> 20:06.806
Could you
come down?

20:06.906 --> 20:08.174
Oh, no, it's good.

20:08.275 --> 20:09.742
It's a good height.

20:09.842 --> 20:10.777
Please, come down.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.581
Fine.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.583
Ruiner.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.889
- Oh, Kimberly says
she's coming over.
- Really?

20:22.989 --> 20:25.992
Tell her she better
hurry up or she's going
to miss Sammy Davis, Jr.

20:26.092 --> 20:27.226
( snickers )

20:31.331 --> 20:32.899
( panting )

20:35.668 --> 20:37.136
Thank you.

20:37.236 --> 20:40.139
Well done.
That was very brave.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.641
Yeah, thank you.

20:41.741 --> 20:44.043
Well, you know, I normally--
I perform with music.

20:44.143 --> 20:46.646
Thank you for sharing
it with us.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.316
It was--
it was very memorable.

20:51.284 --> 20:54.086
This party is
entirely too clothed.

20:54.186 --> 20:56.723
Margo, can we go
in the hot tub?

20:56.823 --> 20:58.525
Margo:
Tub time.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.159
Bathing suits in the
bathroom down the hall.
Right this way.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.828
- Yes.
- Getting naked.

21:01.928 --> 21:02.829
Stuart.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.897
What the hell was that?

21:04.997 --> 21:07.967
Yeah, that-- that
didn't really go as well
as I thought that it would.

21:08.067 --> 21:09.669
You think?

21:09.769 --> 21:11.738
Yeah, and you know
I got Amelia breathing
down my neck.

21:11.838 --> 21:13.740
Of course.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.208
Would you invite
Armand and everyone
over to our house for dinner?

21:16.309 --> 21:18.478
And that way,
I could get him one-on-one.

21:18.578 --> 21:20.813
I could impress him
a little easier.

21:20.913 --> 21:23.149
How am I just going
to invite everyone
to our house?

21:23.249 --> 21:24.917
Casually bring it up.

21:25.017 --> 21:27.420
But, I mean, don't come off
like you're trying too hard.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.988
- Ask casually.
- No, no, I wouldn't
try too hard.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.757
That would be the worst thing
to do in this situation.

21:30.857 --> 21:33.460
I will do this for you
because I have a date
with a model.

21:33.560 --> 21:36.128
- Great, yeah, cool.
Yeah, do it.
- Okay, all right.

21:36.228 --> 21:38.164
Come on, Happy Feet.

21:38.264 --> 21:41.501
Kives, "To do list."
Look, "Finish coding."

21:43.836 --> 21:45.271
- "Don't finish coding."
- Ha ha.

21:45.372 --> 21:46.439
I love it. I love it.

21:46.539 --> 21:47.807
- Hey, you know what?
- What?

21:47.907 --> 21:49.141
Maybe we shouldn't be
on his computer.

21:49.241 --> 21:50.710
That seems like
a violation.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.278
Listen to me, Wade,
you're a great guy, okay?

21:52.379 --> 21:53.546
But you're too nice, man.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.314
I think we're
going easy on him.

21:55.415 --> 21:57.249
Wait a minute, look.
Dude, come here.
Come here.

21:57.350 --> 22:00.086
Look at Pritch before
he lost his looks.

22:00.186 --> 22:02.455
( laughing )

22:02.555 --> 22:04.090
Wow, he's almost as tall
as the Eiffel Tower there.

22:04.190 --> 22:07.360
Look at that.
Hey, "Harry Potter,"
Hermione called.

22:08.895 --> 22:09.929
Let's check this out.

22:10.029 --> 22:12.064
What is this?

22:12.164 --> 22:14.033
"Stuart Pritchard's
hopes and dreams."

22:15.402 --> 22:17.970
Oh, my God,
this is amazing.

22:18.070 --> 22:20.640
"Learn saxophone
to superb level.

22:20.740 --> 22:23.543
Have a threesome.
Me plus two women."

22:23.643 --> 22:24.977
Well, thank you
for clarifying that.

22:26.446 --> 22:28.815
"Learn to relax
during a lap dance."

22:28.915 --> 22:31.851
"If gray hair happens,
make it work."

22:31.951 --> 22:33.953
"Find the right underwear
for body type."

22:36.122 --> 22:38.157
"Get sister's
teeth fixed."

22:38.257 --> 22:39.592
What shape are her
fucking teeth in?

22:39.692 --> 22:43.496
"Date a model.
Take her to school reunion.

22:43.596 --> 22:47.066
Make Trudy regret
her decision.

22:47.166 --> 22:49.769
Experience love.
Reciprocate it.

22:49.869 --> 22:55.007
Wife. Kids.
Happiness, question mark.

22:55.107 --> 22:56.909
Don't die alone."

23:01.280 --> 23:03.916
- I'm gonna close this.
- Yeah.

23:04.016 --> 23:07.086
You know, I'm gonna--
I'm gonna erase that.

23:11.891 --> 23:16.328
Now, everybody,
please keep your hands
where I can't see them.

23:16.429 --> 23:20.166
Talking of hands,
what do you call a lesbian
with long fingernails?

23:20.266 --> 23:21.568
Single.

23:23.736 --> 23:26.105
Where do you get
these jokes from?

23:26.205 --> 23:27.707
I know,
isn't he delightful?

23:27.807 --> 23:29.809
We're roommates,
so I'm laughing 24-7.

23:29.909 --> 23:32.211
Kimberly is gonna love you.
She loves to laugh.

23:32.311 --> 23:33.946
Oh, well, I hope so.

23:34.046 --> 23:36.415
And thank you again
for, you know, making
the introductions.

23:36.516 --> 23:38.718
In fact,
I would love to
invite you gentlemen,

23:38.818 --> 23:40.152
in fact, everyone--
welcome

23:40.252 --> 23:41.854
to come over
our place sometime.

23:41.954 --> 23:43.856
When she's not tap-dancing,
she's a tremendous cook.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.324
I am.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.259
- Thank you,
that sounds lovely.
- Great.

23:47.359 --> 23:48.828
We need
some fun new friends.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.730
We're always hanging out
with the same boring people.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.832
Boring?
How dare you?

23:52.932 --> 23:54.834
I too am hilarious.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.604
What is the definition
of confusion?

23:57.704 --> 23:59.872
20 blind lesbians
in a fish market.

24:01.674 --> 24:03.710
Did you hear about
the gay rock star?

24:03.810 --> 24:06.813
He drank a bottle of scotch
and then tidied his hotel room.

24:06.913 --> 24:09.949
What do you call a gay man
from the South?

24:10.049 --> 24:11.283
A "homo-sex-y'all."

24:11.383 --> 24:13.720
( laughter )

24:13.820 --> 24:15.788
When does--
when does a gay man
become a faggot?

24:15.888 --> 24:18.758
When he leaves
the room.

24:22.161 --> 24:23.696
That's really
offensive.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.197
No, it's not.
Why?

24:25.297 --> 24:27.066
It's homophobic.

24:27.166 --> 24:28.968
No, no, you weren't listening.
No, it's about hypocrisy,
if anything.

24:29.068 --> 24:30.236
Listen again.

24:30.336 --> 24:32.104
When does a gay man
become a faggot?

24:32.204 --> 24:34.306
When he leaves the room.
Do you hear what I'm saying?

24:34.406 --> 24:37.309
It's saying that
straight people call you
faggots behind your back.

24:37.409 --> 24:38.778
- Which we do.
- But we shouldn't.

24:38.878 --> 24:40.346
But we shouldn't.
No, I mean, we don't.

24:40.446 --> 24:41.480
But, you know,
some people do.

24:41.581 --> 24:43.182
Please stop
saying "faggot."

24:43.282 --> 24:44.651
It wasn't even
originally about
gay people.

24:44.751 --> 24:46.452
- I changed the words.
- Yeah, see.

24:46.553 --> 24:48.588
Yeah, originally it was
"When does a black man
become a ni--"

24:54.527 --> 24:56.563
Gosh, I don't remember
what it was.

24:58.464 --> 25:00.032
I think
you should leave.

25:00.132 --> 25:03.035
No, I honestly don't think
you're listening to my point.

25:03.135 --> 25:05.137
Please go.

25:32.565 --> 25:36.102
It was a pleasure
meeting you.

25:42.041 --> 25:45.945
* On a morning
from a Bogart movie *

25:46.045 --> 25:49.849
* In a country where
they turn back time *

25:49.949 --> 25:54.821
* You go strolling through
the crowd like Peter Lorre *

25:54.921 --> 25:57.824
* Contemplating a crime

25:57.924 --> 26:01.694
* She comes out of the sun
in a silk dress *

26:01.794 --> 26:07.066
* Running like a watercolor
in the rain *

26:07.166 --> 26:10.703
* Don't bother asking
for explanations *

26:10.803 --> 26:13.940
* She'll just tell you
that she came *

26:14.040 --> 26:16.208
* In the year
of the cat... *

26:32.625 --> 26:34.326
Sorry about the...

26:34.426 --> 26:36.896
you know, getting
thrown out of the
hot tub and everything.

26:40.132 --> 26:43.703
Well, I'm sorry
about the tap dancing.

26:46.605 --> 26:49.008
( laughs )

26:50.843 --> 26:52.144
Why haven't I
seen it before?

26:52.244 --> 26:53.612
- I was just
saving it up.
- Wow.

26:53.713 --> 26:56.082
Mm-hmm.
The secret weapon.

26:56.182 --> 26:58.017
( chuckling )

26:58.117 --> 27:00.452
( voices on TV )
- Objection, Your Honor!
- Sustained!

27:00.552 --> 27:01.888
Hey.

27:01.988 --> 27:04.323
- How was dinner?
- What's he doing here?

27:04.423 --> 27:08.194
I deliberately live up a hill
with a flight of steps to the
top to stop him visiting.

27:08.294 --> 27:09.896
You're right, Pritch,
sorry about that.

27:09.996 --> 27:11.964
I totally should have
checked before I came over.

27:12.064 --> 27:14.633
- Yeah, don't worry about it.
Just call next time.
- Understood.

27:14.734 --> 27:16.268
'Night, buddy.

27:18.304 --> 27:21.407
You know,
I'm going to get going too.

27:21.507 --> 27:22.842
Thanks for letting me
stay tonight.

27:22.942 --> 27:25.244
Yeah, sorry again for--

27:31.517 --> 27:33.753
- See ya.
- Yeah.

27:42.528 --> 27:44.363
- Stuart: Good night.
- Good night.

27:52.905 --> 27:56.776
* Well, morning comes
and you're still with her *

27:56.876 --> 28:00.612
* And the bus
and the tourists are gone *

28:00.713 --> 28:05.051
* And you've thrown away
your choice and lost
your ticket *

28:05.151 --> 28:09.321
* So you have to stay on

28:09.421 --> 28:12.959
* But the drumbeat strains
of the night remain *

28:13.059 --> 28:17.363
* In the rhythm of
the newborn day *

28:17.463 --> 28:20.933
* You know sometime
you're bound to leave her *

28:21.033 --> 28:24.303
* But for now
you're going to stay *

28:24.403 --> 28:27.874
* In the year of the cat

28:36.182 --> 28:39.051
* Mm, the year of the cat.
