"Reform schools aim to develop
Christian personalities

00:28.521 --> 00:31.577
by raising children to believe
and moulding the entirety of the child

00:31.601 --> 00:34.056
with all his natural abilities
in the service of love."

00:34.321 --> 00:37.685
Guideline for educator training at
the former Freistatt Welfare Institution

00:51.081 --> 00:54.201
Based on true events,
shot at the original locations.

01:29.041 --> 01:30.361
Hey!

01:32.761 --> 01:34.481
I told you to tweak it, not junk it!

01:34.881 --> 01:36.700
Now that clunker
takes off like a rocket!

01:38.561 --> 01:41.425
Who's gonna reach the moon first?
The Americans or the Russians?

01:41.641 --> 01:44.005
The Russians, of course.
- The Americans. - Watch out

01:44.321 --> 01:46.561
that the school
doesn't lengthen your contract.

01:47.001 --> 01:48.521
Two more exams and I'm done.

01:49.881 --> 01:52.441
In fall I'll become a mechanic
working for Struve.

01:54.521 --> 01:57.561
You applied, too, didn't you?
- With Struve? - Yes.

01:58.001 --> 02:00.441
Does your father approve?
- Step-father!

02:03.161 --> 02:05.681
He won't be around long.
- Sure.

02:07.641 --> 02:11.001
When he runs into the wall with a hard-on
he breaks his nose first.

02:13.401 --> 02:14.481
Watch it!

02:15.361 --> 02:16.881
Wolfgang!

02:19.721 --> 02:22.481
Would you stop it.
- Wolfi, I want a piece, too.

02:22.881 --> 02:27.121
Take the biggest one.
Help yourself, it's my favorite cake.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.321
Thank you.
- Thank you, Wolfi.

02:36.761 --> 02:38.441
She sure knows how to bake.

02:42.761 --> 02:45.241
Want to see some hot stuff?
- Yeah, cool.

02:46.321 --> 02:48.641
Biene, I don't think
it's anything for little girls.

02:54.601 --> 02:57.081
She wants it bad.
- Hands off!

02:57.481 --> 02:59.800
From the front, from the back.
- What are you doing?

03:01.321 --> 03:03.041
How icky!

03:05.841 --> 03:08.041
Heinz is such a dirty slob.

03:14.481 --> 03:16.001
Get outta here! Move it!

03:16.401 --> 03:17.401
Out!

03:26.281 --> 03:27.281
So?

03:29.241 --> 03:33.641
Do you have anything to say to me?
- Why are you embarrassed by that mag?

03:47.761 --> 03:49.681
You can do better than that. Come on.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.281
Stop it! Heinz!

03:58.881 --> 04:01.561
I told you
nobody's gonna make a fool of me.

04:02.601 --> 04:05.441
He can do whatever he likes.
But not in my house!

04:06.201 --> 04:07.441
Come on!

04:08.161 --> 04:09.441
Come on!

04:17.241 --> 04:19.281
Just you wait, pal. Just you wait!

04:29.841 --> 04:31.361
Does it hurt?

04:33.041 --> 04:34.041
What a bastard!

04:40.561 --> 04:42.201
It can't go on like this.

04:42.561 --> 04:45.161
There's not enough room
for three brats here.

05:02.601 --> 05:04.681
Okay, it's time to go.

05:05.401 --> 05:07.361
I promise you'll be home by Christmas.

05:07.721 --> 05:09.201
Here's the cake.

05:15.281 --> 05:17.321
Can I sleep on top now?

05:17.681 --> 05:20.321
Sure, but only until I come back.

05:22.681 --> 05:26.081
Keep your chin up!
- Are you coming back?

05:27.081 --> 05:30.681
I have to finish school...
- You can call anytime...

05:31.121 --> 05:33.401
Thank you for everything.
- I love you.

05:35.641 --> 05:36.681
Wolfgang!

05:37.881 --> 05:38.881
Thank you.

05:40.561 --> 05:41.801
Ingrid!
- Bye.

06:15.521 --> 06:19.201
SANCTUARY

08:11.601 --> 08:12.601
Thank you.

08:40.681 --> 08:41.681
Sing!

08:42.721 --> 08:43.721
What?

08:49.281 --> 08:51.321
Go ahead. Sing a song.

09:06.401 --> 09:07.561
That's enough.

09:09.321 --> 09:11.841
Oh well, you tried.

09:14.201 --> 09:15.881
You have a good voice.

09:20.681 --> 09:23.241
Unruly, disobedient.

09:23.641 --> 09:27.081
Six months "Heidequell" Reform School,
ran away after three months,

09:27.481 --> 09:30.041
aggressive behavior.
- I just fought back.

09:35.041 --> 09:37.681
Denies his misbehavior, lies,

09:38.121 --> 09:39.481
lacks understanding,

09:39.881 --> 09:42.601
has no desire to reform.
- I never hit anyone!

09:44.201 --> 09:46.121
My step-father wants to get rid of me.

09:46.481 --> 09:47.601
I see.

09:49.481 --> 09:53.241
Know what, Wolfgang? I think highly
of the reports from Youth Welfare.

09:57.401 --> 10:01.241
They make excellent pots
for seedlings.

10:01.841 --> 10:06.961
Later we can plant the seedlings
together with the pot.

10:08.681 --> 10:10.721
And when the paper is wet...

10:13.481 --> 10:16.441
the roots quickly find their way
into the dirt.

10:17.281 --> 10:18.881
Got any hobbies?

10:20.121 --> 10:21.401
Yeah, soccer.

10:21.761 --> 10:24.121
And I like to work on motorbikes.
- Good.

10:26.801 --> 10:29.081
We can use agile hands here.

10:29.481 --> 10:34.281
I think the two of us
will get along well together.

10:35.201 --> 10:38.321
And we'll crop your mane a little.

10:42.081 --> 10:43.561
Your watch, too.

10:57.761 --> 11:00.121
Come on, don't fall asleep!

11:04.761 --> 11:06.161
Where are the others?

11:07.161 --> 11:09.361
Come on, get a move on it!

11:15.201 --> 11:17.321
Look, a newbie.

11:18.161 --> 11:19.401
Move it!

11:20.041 --> 11:23.241
You're always causing trouble!
You are such a little wimp!

11:23.601 --> 11:27.441
I'll show you how to work! - Come here.
- Half rations for everybody!

11:28.121 --> 11:31.161
You wait here until the others
have changed, then you go.

11:31.801 --> 11:34.441
What's your name?
- Wolfgang. - Okay, guys,

11:34.841 --> 11:36.041
off to the showers!

11:36.441 --> 11:38.121
You're next!
- Penis.

11:38.481 --> 11:39.641
You can go now.

11:42.601 --> 11:43.721
Piss off!

11:55.081 --> 11:57.561
Did you look at my ass?
- No!

11:58.721 --> 11:59.881
Move it!

12:17.521 --> 12:20.081
Hey!
- Shut up! This is my piece now!

12:20.481 --> 12:22.081
Shut up!
- Shit!

12:30.201 --> 12:31.241
Let's pray.

12:32.041 --> 12:33.361
Sit up straight.

12:36.321 --> 12:39.081
Bless this meal, oh Lord,

12:39.481 --> 12:42.601
give us strength to praise you.

12:43.201 --> 12:44.201
Amen.

12:51.641 --> 12:52.641
Enjoy it.

12:53.121 --> 12:54.721
Bon appetit.

13:24.401 --> 13:27.961
Speak freely.
- Thank you, Big Brother Wilde.

13:35.161 --> 13:36.201
Hi, I'm Anton.

13:39.521 --> 13:42.121
I heard you come from OsnabrÃ¼ck?
I do, too.

13:43.321 --> 13:46.121
What music do you like?
- You keep your mouth shut!

13:51.201 --> 13:52.361
24,

13:52.721 --> 13:53.721
25,

13:54.841 --> 13:56.361
26.

13:56.721 --> 13:58.881
I don't want to hear a peep!

13:59.761 --> 14:01.121
27,

14:01.641 --> 14:02.641
28.

14:03.001 --> 14:05.161
Ah, welcome. You get a bit more.

14:05.521 --> 14:06.601
29.

14:07.041 --> 14:09.241
30.
- What sort of shit

14:10.001 --> 14:11.681
did you do today?

14:12.121 --> 14:13.481
You just did half a job.

14:13.881 --> 14:17.321
And I get half rations!
Know how hungry I am?

14:18.601 --> 14:21.521
You're done for, man.
You know what I mean?

14:27.921 --> 14:30.201
You're getting your dick polished.

14:33.721 --> 14:36.521
I told you to lift it up.
- No.

14:37.001 --> 14:39.841
No, please don't.
- If you fuck up, you gotta lift it.

14:43.561 --> 14:45.241
No!

14:45.601 --> 14:50.121
Please. Please! - Work faster
next time, then this won't happen.

14:50.481 --> 14:52.601
Hold your dick still.
- Hey, you ass!

14:58.681 --> 15:01.241
Ass like the end of my back?
- Exactly!

15:01.601 --> 15:04.961
Know what? You aren't gonna have
any teeth to brush.

15:06.521 --> 15:08.401
Your mouth stinks like a cow's ass.

15:12.721 --> 15:13.721
Really?

15:21.681 --> 15:24.961
With a face like his
a fart doesn't know where to come out.

15:27.481 --> 15:29.241
What?
- Relax.

15:29.601 --> 15:31.281
Just kidding.

15:33.801 --> 15:36.961
You got a big mouth for a kid your size.

15:37.921 --> 15:40.103
Want to try some polish?
Tastes good, doesn't it?

15:41.241 --> 15:42.241
Tastes good, huh?

15:42.601 --> 15:43.681
It tastes good.

15:48.721 --> 15:49.761
"Brother Bernd".

15:50.801 --> 15:52.892
Want me to smash your face in?
- That's enough!

15:53.081 --> 15:54.201
Everybody upstairs!

15:54.561 --> 15:56.161
Hooligans!

15:57.081 --> 15:58.881
Don't give me any trouble.

16:14.121 --> 16:16.321
Damn it, I can't get the stuff off.

16:16.841 --> 16:17.961
Shit.

16:21.601 --> 16:23.721
Hey, is everything okay?

16:24.481 --> 16:28.481
You're so stupid!
You don't understand a thing. Get lost!

16:41.161 --> 16:44.081
17, 18, 19, 20,

16:44.481 --> 16:47.161
21, 22, 23...

16:48.041 --> 16:52.241
That's your bed over there.
25, 26, 27,

16:52.601 --> 16:55.601
28, 29...

16:58.681 --> 17:01.521
Good night, boys!
- Good night, Brother Krapp!

17:14.161 --> 17:15.441
Hey there.

17:16.481 --> 17:19.521
Don't touch me.
Never again. Understand?

17:40.601 --> 17:42.961
Can I be your sidekick?

17:43.881 --> 17:46.121
What's that about?
- Shh, quiet.

17:46.921 --> 17:50.801
I give you tobacco and cookies,
and you protect me.

18:20.761 --> 18:22.281
Attention!

18:29.841 --> 18:33.161
Good morning.
- Good morning, Housefather Brockmann!

18:33.521 --> 18:35.521
Good morning, Big Brother Wilde.

18:35.921 --> 18:38.361
Good morning, Brother Krapp.
- March in place!

18:41.161 --> 18:42.361
A song!

18:43.321 --> 18:49.441
Far and wide as the eye can wander-Heath and bog are everywhere

18:49.841 --> 18:52.521
Not a bird sings out to cheer us

18:52.921 --> 18:56.201
Oaks are standing gaunt and bare

18:56.881 --> 19:00.081
We are the peat bog soldiers

19:00.481 --> 19:03.561
Marching with our spades

19:04.001 --> 19:05.481
To the moor...

19:31.401 --> 19:33.561
Come on! Move it!

19:35.681 --> 19:37.401
Come on!

19:40.401 --> 19:41.401
Faster!

19:47.441 --> 19:48.961
Come on!

19:51.921 --> 19:53.001
Let's go!

20:00.681 --> 20:01.681
Move it!

20:06.121 --> 20:07.881
Push, push!

20:16.641 --> 20:19.561
What are you doing up front?
Having a tea party?

20:20.001 --> 20:22.121
How do you call it in your dialect?

20:22.841 --> 20:24.721
Are you a lazybones or what?

20:45.481 --> 20:49.361
I'd like a ride with her.
- Starry eyes ahead again!

20:49.721 --> 20:51.281
There's nothing to see.

21:10.081 --> 21:11.961
Roll up your sleeves!

21:17.201 --> 21:20.561
How do your briquets look?
Miserable would be an understatement.

21:28.321 --> 21:30.561
Are you retiring already?

21:31.001 --> 21:32.961
We do muscle exams here.

21:33.361 --> 21:34.961
The Lord sees everything.

21:35.361 --> 21:37.321
You want lunch, don't you?

21:38.041 --> 21:39.841
No half-assed stuff! Pile them up.

21:42.441 --> 21:43.441
Whole briquets.

21:58.361 --> 22:00.081
Move your ass!

22:01.081 --> 22:02.441
That's how you say it.

22:03.481 --> 22:04.601
Yup.

22:08.921 --> 22:10.521
Quiet, you damn Nigger!

22:15.201 --> 22:17.521
Smoke freely!
- Thank you!

22:24.441 --> 22:25.961
Give me the match.

22:30.521 --> 22:31.641
I don't smoke.

22:48.401 --> 22:49.481
The lighter!

22:49.881 --> 22:50.881
Scoundrel!

23:12.001 --> 23:13.361
Get up, back to work.

23:27.001 --> 23:29.321
You get your rubber boots in two months.

23:29.681 --> 23:32.041
What? In two months?

23:32.441 --> 23:34.721
Yeah.
- In two months?

23:35.481 --> 23:39.121
What's the deal? I want boots right now!
- Listen here,

23:39.481 --> 23:41.201
the new guy has shit in his shoe!

23:43.281 --> 23:46.001
Is that what you want?
It isn't the peat that's shitty!

23:46.401 --> 23:48.041
You're shitty!

23:51.521 --> 23:54.561
Stop it! What's wrong with you?

23:56.201 --> 23:57.881
You're still too soft on them!

23:59.561 --> 24:01.521
Get back to work! Go on!

24:02.281 --> 24:03.321
Move it!

24:08.841 --> 24:11.361
Show your housemaster
what you can do!

24:13.521 --> 24:14.841
Don't just gawp.

24:18.681 --> 24:23.401
Once again, when you work
the peat, make sure the briquets

24:23.761 --> 24:25.481
are the same size.

25:04.361 --> 25:06.441
What are you doing? Don't!

25:20.841 --> 25:22.881
Are you crazy? That's pointless!
- Shut up!

25:27.481 --> 25:29.121
What's wrong?

25:31.561 --> 25:33.641
Stop! We have a problem!

25:50.401 --> 25:51.801
What's this?

25:52.721 --> 25:54.081
What's going on?

25:55.881 --> 25:58.201
What's going on?
- Don't just stand around staring!

25:58.561 --> 26:00.652
Four get down, two on each side.
At my command!

26:01.001 --> 26:02.201
Yeh, alright.

26:02.561 --> 26:03.761
Cliff, come here!

26:09.921 --> 26:11.121
This was in there.

27:14.481 --> 27:15.481
Come on.

27:16.921 --> 27:18.761
Come on home.

27:31.441 --> 27:32.841
Hold still.

28:03.561 --> 28:04.881
Hey.

28:05.881 --> 28:07.481
It'll grow back.

28:19.761 --> 28:21.601
Nagger and Nigger, huh?

28:23.441 --> 28:26.401
Know what I really hate?
A smoking ban.

28:27.641 --> 28:28.881
A whole week.

28:30.721 --> 28:34.361
I thought, âOkay,
maybe he's just a bit stupid.

28:35.321 --> 28:38.881
Maybe I have to really
explain the rules to him.â

28:43.161 --> 28:45.161
So you're a team, huh?

28:48.801 --> 28:50.641
Does it hurt? Does it hurt?

28:51.081 --> 28:52.521
Does it hurt?
- Look at that!

28:58.801 --> 29:00.601
Get up! Get up!

29:01.681 --> 29:04.761
I want my tobacco!

29:05.361 --> 29:06.361
Come on, guys!

29:11.281 --> 29:12.561
Stop!

29:24.921 --> 29:27.721
Hit him!

29:28.521 --> 29:30.521
Don't stroke him, hit him!

29:44.241 --> 29:45.841
Don't be so quick about it.

30:27.001 --> 30:28.521
Come here, my boy.

30:40.841 --> 30:42.681
Everything will be okay.

31:01.801 --> 31:02.881
Okay.

31:04.201 --> 31:06.521
You'll have to sleep on your belly now.

31:23.601 --> 31:25.481
Hey, I'm really sorry.

31:32.681 --> 31:34.721
You think I'm a real bastard, huh?

31:35.161 --> 31:38.361
But in here you gotta do what they say,
or you won't survive.

31:38.721 --> 31:40.441
I know who'll make it and who won't.

31:43.641 --> 31:45.161
I'll be outta here by Christmas.

31:46.481 --> 31:49.761
Oh yeah.
Is that what your parents told you?

31:50.561 --> 31:54.401
That's what they told GÃ¼nther, too.
He was 13 back then.

31:59.521 --> 32:02.401
It won't take long.
And then Brockmann will finish you off.

32:02.761 --> 32:05.681
And you'll look like this.
Stop it now.

32:07.041 --> 32:08.441
Stop biting your nails.

32:16.881 --> 32:18.361
What do you think?

32:25.721 --> 32:27.281
He isn't gonna get me.

32:28.241 --> 32:29.241
Never.

33:29.601 --> 33:31.321
Hey, are you outta your mind?

33:33.321 --> 33:34.681
That's my mother!

33:36.841 --> 33:38.521
She has such beautiful breasts.

33:40.761 --> 33:42.561
I'll give you some breasts!

33:46.001 --> 33:49.041
...I want to try to be a better person.

33:49.441 --> 33:53.761
I cause the boys
a lot of trouble at work.

33:54.241 --> 33:55.641
Thank you, Lord,

33:56.281 --> 33:58.281
for letting me stay at Freistatt.

33:59.361 --> 34:00.841
Are you crazy?

34:01.281 --> 34:03.721
Sitting here on this fucking cold floor.
Go to bed!

34:04.161 --> 34:07.841
Watch over Brother Wilde
and especially Brother Krapp.

34:10.001 --> 34:11.721
You're praying for those pigs?

34:13.161 --> 34:15.841
Are you completely off your rocker?
Come on.

34:24.481 --> 34:25.841
It's okay.

34:26.761 --> 34:27.880
It's okay.

34:46.121 --> 34:49.161
Stop staring. That's Angelika,
Brockmann's daughter.

34:49.521 --> 34:53.440
Just imagine, she lives next door,
but she isn't allowed to talk to us.

35:09.001 --> 35:12.121
Are you almost finished?
Full? You can fit some more in.

35:12.721 --> 35:13.841
Two or three.

35:14.441 --> 35:17.201
One of you helps carry it.
Wolfgang, come here!

35:18.881 --> 35:20.481
Help carry it.

35:21.001 --> 35:22.201
Come on!

35:27.001 --> 35:29.401
Come on, hurry up.

35:30.001 --> 35:32.521
As fast as if the devil
was pulling that peat.

35:42.641 --> 35:45.521
I could patch your trousers
as you stand there.

35:46.121 --> 35:48.361
Let's see.
We can manage seven loads a week.

35:49.001 --> 35:53.201
But that makes 400 marks.

35:53.561 --> 35:57.001
Oh, that's a bit too expensive.
I can't buy it for that.

35:57.401 --> 35:59.081
I'll offer you 300

35:59.481 --> 36:01.121
in cash.

36:02.201 --> 36:03.441
350.

36:04.281 --> 36:07.441
Okay, since it's you,
since we bargained so long.

36:07.801 --> 36:10.881
350... here.

36:11.441 --> 36:13.281
We're starting in five minutes!

36:14.481 --> 36:17.401
I hope it's all right.
Okay, take care. See you soon.

36:19.441 --> 36:20.561
Drive away.

36:46.481 --> 36:47.841
Hey guys, move it.

36:48.361 --> 36:50.961
There's a black music concert tonight.
- Quiet!

36:59.481 --> 37:00.481
Stop!

37:03.481 --> 37:05.441
10 minutes.
- What?

37:06.241 --> 37:07.241
Move it!

37:07.561 --> 37:08.881
Go down there.

37:11.241 --> 37:12.481
What's going on?

37:15.441 --> 37:18.481
Listen up, you do-gooder!
You gotta clear it with me first.

37:19.841 --> 37:22.721
Why not go back to welding?
It's what you trained for.

37:28.161 --> 37:30.041
I'm preparing them for life!

37:44.761 --> 37:46.201
Fetch the stick!

37:55.601 --> 37:56.681
Gimme that.

38:11.241 --> 38:12.281
Dear Mom.

38:13.201 --> 38:15.961
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

38:16.921 --> 38:19.121
I'm learning a lot about the Christian faith.

38:19.481 --> 38:24.161
They take good care of me, I'm outdoors
a lot and have made many friends.

38:25.481 --> 38:27.001
Please write soon.

38:27.681 --> 38:28.881
Yours, Wolfgang.

38:49.721 --> 38:50.961
Hey, stop it!

38:52.081 --> 38:55.121
Some nice sauerbraten
from my grandma. Juicy and delicious.

38:55.761 --> 38:56.761
It'd be great.

38:58.641 --> 39:00.201
But this hits the spot, too.

39:00.561 --> 39:02.681
Oh, you're gonna get the runs.

39:22.481 --> 39:23.561
What a knockout!

39:24.801 --> 39:26.281
A real love bomb.

39:27.001 --> 39:28.441
Damn chain!

39:34.801 --> 39:36.121
Wolfgang.

39:43.481 --> 39:45.241
Don't say a thing.

40:13.521 --> 40:15.441
It's boring in the bog, right?

40:18.521 --> 40:21.081
What are you here for? Stealing candy?

40:26.761 --> 40:27.761
I smoked weed.

40:28.721 --> 40:30.081
You want a drag?

40:41.281 --> 40:43.361
Can you send this away for me?

40:44.521 --> 40:48.121
You're a really cool boy.
If my father ever found out...

40:49.641 --> 40:52.121
Please.
- What will you give me?

40:57.161 --> 40:58.441
I have an idea.

41:08.921 --> 41:12.761
Get in the house! - Should I tell you
what this little kid did to me?

41:13.201 --> 41:16.481
He hit on me.
He did it again! Why are you staring?

41:16.881 --> 41:19.441
Are you deaf?
What are you staring at?

41:21.481 --> 41:24.441
Next time I'll kick your ass.
Do you understand?

41:26.561 --> 41:27.801
Help your mother.
- What?

41:28.161 --> 41:30.441
Should I let him touch me?

41:37.521 --> 41:41.081
Explain to your comrades why
they aren't getting any dinner tonight.

41:45.521 --> 41:48.241
I could sole your shoes
while you're walking!

41:49.721 --> 41:51.441
No dinner tonight.

41:52.121 --> 41:53.241
Yes, sir.

42:10.041 --> 42:12.269
I have no desire
to keep slugging you in the face.

42:12.361 --> 42:16.041
Why can't you stick to the rules?
How can the guys survive tomorrow?

42:18.321 --> 42:20.441
This is not all about you.

42:25.361 --> 42:27.401
Then I'll get us something to eat.

42:33.601 --> 42:35.681
The garden is Brockmann's sacred place.

42:36.121 --> 42:38.561
You may as well screw his daughter.
- Wanna bet?

42:44.481 --> 42:45.881
For tobacco.

42:47.161 --> 42:49.721
You won't even get a tomato,
not a single one.

42:54.641 --> 42:56.801
Ah, for the garden.

43:00.241 --> 43:02.601
You don't have the boys under control.

43:05.361 --> 43:09.801
Don't you like it here? - Sure.
- Want to go back to welding pipes?

43:11.361 --> 43:12.561
I do all I can.

43:20.561 --> 43:21.561
Yes!

43:24.481 --> 43:26.281
Yes!

43:31.441 --> 43:33.281
Five!
- He's crazy.

43:37.681 --> 43:39.041
Shit!

43:40.481 --> 43:41.641
Get lost.

45:06.481 --> 45:08.441
Honestly! That's enough!

45:53.681 --> 45:56.161
Just stop it.
- Was that all you got?

45:59.241 --> 46:01.641
Stop it! Stop it now!

46:37.521 --> 46:39.441
Garden work, pest control.

46:39.841 --> 46:42.401
Wolfgang: insubordination.
Punishment: four slaps.

46:43.001 --> 46:45.441
Book of punishments

46:50.841 --> 46:54.001
Quick, raise his head.
- Shit, what's this here?

46:55.241 --> 46:56.521
Shit.

46:59.321 --> 47:01.161
We'll dress his wounds.

47:18.081 --> 47:19.401
Now be quiet.

47:55.321 --> 47:58.401
I found something
among my daughter's things.

48:10.041 --> 48:11.121
"Dear Mom...

48:15.561 --> 48:17.601
Get me out of here, please.

48:20.001 --> 48:23.601
I can't stand it here.

48:27.121 --> 48:30.681
We are beaten and tortured..."

48:32.641 --> 48:34.161
Go on reading.

48:51.441 --> 48:54.041
"Sometimes I cry myself
to sleep at night."

48:54.441 --> 48:56.441
Read it louder.

48:57.561 --> 48:59.721
"I would love to be back home
with you again.

49:02.161 --> 49:03.481
I won't cause trouble again.

49:08.481 --> 49:09.721
I miss you so much.

49:16.201 --> 49:17.521
Yours, Wolfgang."

49:29.401 --> 49:31.881
I don't care. Punish me.

49:52.561 --> 49:53.561
Please.

50:30.081 --> 50:31.481
Be quiet!

51:22.201 --> 51:23.401
Quieten them down!

51:23.761 --> 51:25.721
Stop it!
- It's your fault!

51:26.161 --> 51:28.241
Stop! Stop this childish behaviour!

51:28.761 --> 51:30.721
I'll have you for this!

51:32.001 --> 51:33.001
Him!

51:35.761 --> 51:38.281
Stop! I'll have you as well!

51:41.401 --> 51:42.901
Get a grip of yourself!
- Stop it!

51:43.321 --> 51:45.281
Stop it!
- Get a grip!

51:47.481 --> 51:48.481
That Nigger there.

51:51.481 --> 51:53.001
Just you wait!

51:53.401 --> 51:54.761
For my Wolfgang

51:57.281 --> 51:58.281
Mr. Brockmann.

51:58.641 --> 52:01.081
The boys are going crazy.
What should we do?

52:04.401 --> 52:05.681
Piece of cake?

52:08.361 --> 52:09.881
No, thanks.

52:42.521 --> 52:43.681
Give it to me.

52:58.481 --> 53:01.121
Don't you see? She doesn't remember you.

53:01.441 --> 53:02.801
Not even on your birthday.

53:07.841 --> 53:09.761
What did you do for your mother?

53:11.881 --> 53:13.001
I defended my mother.

53:14.601 --> 53:16.961
I got my face smashed in.

53:18.201 --> 53:19.481
I saved her life.

53:19.881 --> 53:21.521
But does she write me?

53:28.521 --> 53:29.801
Believe me.

53:30.601 --> 53:32.641
She forgot you.

53:33.201 --> 53:34.201
Give me that.

53:34.561 --> 53:35.761
No!

53:37.321 --> 53:40.321
Give me the photo!
Give me it, asshole!

53:41.441 --> 53:43.561
They forgot us. Just look at it.

53:44.001 --> 53:46.761
They forgot us! Everybody forgot us!

54:24.401 --> 54:25.841
Dear Freistatt boys,

54:26.281 --> 54:28.201
I know that tonight

54:28.561 --> 54:31.721
you're all thinking
of your parents, and your parents

54:32.481 --> 54:36.281
are certainly thinking
of you tonight.

54:38.481 --> 54:39.961
You wonder:

54:40.841 --> 54:45.721
Why can't I be with my family tonight?

54:46.881 --> 54:49.281
Why do they leave me here alone?
- Come on.

54:50.841 --> 54:54.001
But our Lord
doesn't leave anyone alone.

54:54.481 --> 54:59.001
And when you are worried,
the church embraces you with open arms.

54:59.401 --> 55:00.801
Fine, for baby Jesus.

55:02.881 --> 55:04.441
Here, throw it in.

55:06.241 --> 55:11.641
Maria walks amid the thorn

55:12.481 --> 55:15.881
Kyrie eleison

55:17.481 --> 55:23.001
Maria walks amid the thorn

55:23.401 --> 55:28.601
Which seven years no leaf has born

55:30.561 --> 55:34.241
Jesus and Mary

55:36.721 --> 55:38.321
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas...

55:40.401 --> 55:42.681
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas...

55:46.161 --> 55:48.201
Hans stole this from the kitchen.

55:57.281 --> 55:58.281
Merry Christmas.

56:05.201 --> 56:06.241
Brother Krapp.

56:12.321 --> 56:15.281
I have a present for you.
- For me?

56:15.721 --> 56:19.241
Finished Brockmann's cake?
- Thank you, Mattis. You're a good boy.

56:23.801 --> 56:26.201
Don't throw the food around!
Merry Christmas.

56:30.041 --> 56:32.041
I have an announcement to make.

56:33.721 --> 56:35.521
Brother Krapp will be leaving us.

56:36.481 --> 56:37.561
For personal reasons.

56:39.641 --> 56:43.001
We regret his decision
and wish him all the best

56:43.681 --> 56:46.561
along his further path.
- What?

56:50.441 --> 56:51.801
You can't do that.

56:53.681 --> 56:55.441
It's okay, Mattis. Sit down.

57:00.561 --> 57:01.961
It's okay.

57:03.601 --> 57:05.441
Now go back to your seat.

57:06.481 --> 57:08.441
I didn't tell anyone.

57:09.241 --> 57:11.761
I swear. - What?
- I didn't tell anyone.

57:13.801 --> 57:16.521
It's all my fault.
- I don't know what you mean.

57:16.921 --> 57:20.285
Sit down! - It's all my fault. - What?
- Is that why you don't like me now?

57:20.641 --> 57:24.801
I'll be even nicer to you. - Stop it!
- But I'm your dear Mattis! Please!

57:25.241 --> 57:28.241
Please! - Stop it!
- I'm your dear Mattis! - Stop it!

57:29.721 --> 57:30.761
Please.

57:40.361 --> 57:41.441
Get him out!

57:43.521 --> 57:44.881
I don't know...

57:45.321 --> 57:47.881
Come here. Get up.
I really don't know what...

57:48.321 --> 57:50.001
Get outta here!

57:51.481 --> 57:53.121
I didn't want to...
- Get out!

57:56.361 --> 57:58.481
Take me with you. Please!

57:58.881 --> 58:02.201
You can't do this.
- I'm sorry. - Get out!

58:07.361 --> 58:09.001
Then let us sing.

58:14.481 --> 58:15.481
Bernd.

58:28.321 --> 58:32.601
Oh you merry

58:33.041 --> 58:37.041
Oh you blessed

58:37.441 --> 58:43.801
Merciful Christmastide

58:45.041 --> 58:48.841
The world was lost...

01:00:51.801 --> 01:00:53.561
Turn that thing off!

01:01:00.921 --> 01:01:04.601
Where are the others?
- Tidying up. This group is finished.

01:01:06.201 --> 01:01:09.161
The TV will only be turned on
when the housefather says so.

01:01:11.161 --> 01:01:13.041
Why don't you play Mau Mau?

01:01:44.361 --> 01:01:46.161
Cliff, come here!

01:01:46.601 --> 01:01:48.761
Here you dig peat everywhere!

01:01:57.161 --> 01:02:01.161
Come on! You got an hour
to clear out all this underbrush!

01:02:06.921 --> 01:02:08.241
I want this place clean!

01:02:08.601 --> 01:02:10.721
We'll stay together, won't we?

01:02:38.241 --> 01:02:40.121
Big Brother needs help.

01:02:58.841 --> 01:03:00.481
Come here.

01:03:06.481 --> 01:03:07.801
I'm going to boarding school.

01:03:08.241 --> 01:03:11.441
To Hamburg. At last.
I was at my wit's end thinking of ways

01:03:11.801 --> 01:03:15.961
to get out of here. Maybe
I can even study, Political Science.

01:03:20.561 --> 01:03:21.801
Fabulous.

01:03:23.281 --> 01:03:24.441
That's great.

01:04:35.601 --> 01:04:36.761
Wolfgang!

01:04:42.601 --> 01:04:45.121
Stop it, Wolfgang! Stop it!

01:04:45.481 --> 01:04:46.641
Wolfgang, stop it!

01:05:24.441 --> 01:05:25.881
I'll come and visit you soon.

01:05:51.561 --> 01:05:54.121
What do your briquets look like...

01:05:54.561 --> 01:05:56.161
Come on, come on!

01:05:57.001 --> 01:05:58.321
Work hard!

01:05:58.681 --> 01:06:00.881
We grease the Earth on her axis here.

01:06:05.841 --> 01:06:07.441
What's wrong with you?

01:06:08.521 --> 01:06:09.521
Go!

01:06:09.721 --> 01:06:11.361
You should kowtow. That's Japanese.

01:06:12.361 --> 01:06:15.361
Kiss my ass!
- Here, take the digger.

01:06:16.601 --> 01:06:17.721
Come on!

01:06:19.441 --> 01:06:20.881
You think it's funny?

01:06:21.641 --> 01:06:23.121
Then I'll show you what's funny.

01:06:23.801 --> 01:06:25.321
This is funny!

01:06:26.321 --> 01:06:27.681
Come on! Get to work!

01:06:28.121 --> 01:06:29.161
Come on!

01:06:30.281 --> 01:06:33.081
I warn you. I can get mean! I'm not...

01:06:38.721 --> 01:06:40.176
It isn't the peat that's shitty!

01:06:56.441 --> 01:06:59.161
What are you waiting for? Come on!

01:07:05.601 --> 01:07:08.201
I'll kill you!

01:07:30.401 --> 01:07:31.401
Come on!

01:07:32.321 --> 01:07:33.721
Come on!

01:08:51.441 --> 01:08:52.441
Shit.

01:08:56.161 --> 01:08:58.201
The dyke. Come on.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.241
Come back, Anton.
- I'm stuck.

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:11.720
Take my hand!

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:16.001
Come on. Anton, Come on!

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:56.001
We made it. We'll make it.

01:10:03.001 --> 01:10:04.841
Are you alright?

01:10:20.561 --> 01:10:21.801
I can't go on.

01:10:38.681 --> 01:10:39.681
Shit.

01:10:48.601 --> 01:10:51.241
Come on.
- Maybe we better go back.

01:10:52.281 --> 01:10:53.841
I'll get us outta here, Anton.

01:11:26.561 --> 01:11:28.361
We've almost made it.

01:12:17.441 --> 01:12:19.601
Come on. Come on.

01:12:21.001 --> 01:12:23.081
Now get up there.

01:12:24.241 --> 01:12:25.961
Got it?
- Yeah.

01:12:26.361 --> 01:12:31.241
17 is a good age for a horse, isn't it?
- Yeah,

01:12:31.601 --> 01:12:34.881
it was always true blue.
- Yeah, I believe you.

01:12:35.321 --> 01:12:39.321
Do you know what? - What?
- The police were here yesterday.

01:12:39.921 --> 01:12:44.361
What for? - Some boys ran away
from Freistatt. - OsnabrÃ¼ck.

01:12:44.721 --> 01:12:45.721
Bad kids?

01:13:16.561 --> 01:13:17.961
Home at last.

01:13:21.121 --> 01:13:23.801
Those boots suit you.
- Yes, considering they're stolen.

01:13:32.481 --> 01:13:34.121
Good luck. See you.

01:13:40.081 --> 01:13:41.627
You're going to your parents, too?

01:13:42.921 --> 01:13:44.841
What street do you live on?

01:13:50.721 --> 01:13:52.081
You don't even live here.

01:13:53.481 --> 01:13:54.601
Not even in OsnabrÃ¼ck?

01:13:57.881 --> 01:13:59.321
You don't have any parents.

01:14:01.641 --> 01:14:03.561
But you got letters.

01:14:04.721 --> 01:14:06.161
The letters, who wrote them?

01:14:10.401 --> 01:14:11.441
You?

01:14:15.481 --> 01:14:18.281
You can't come home with me!
- Please.

01:14:19.041 --> 01:14:22.241
My mother's old man doesn't
even want me! - I'm your sidekick.

01:14:27.881 --> 01:14:30.001
Here, call your relatives
or friends! Go on!

01:14:34.601 --> 01:14:37.561
Go on!
You can't come with me! Get lost!

01:15:11.521 --> 01:15:12.561
What happened to you?

01:15:18.641 --> 01:15:21.041
You're chilled to the bones.

01:15:22.841 --> 01:15:24.241
What happened?

01:15:29.401 --> 01:15:30.601
Wait a second.

01:15:49.081 --> 01:15:50.218
They'll beat me to death!

01:15:50.481 --> 01:15:51.481
Who?

01:15:54.441 --> 01:15:56.121
At the institution?

01:16:17.721 --> 01:16:20.441
You wrote me that...
- We had to write it.

01:16:34.721 --> 01:16:37.841
Yes? - Good morning,
my name is Brockmann. - Wolfi?

01:16:38.281 --> 01:16:40.217
I'm the housefather...
- Wolfi, what's wrong?

01:16:40.241 --> 01:16:43.681
Ah, good morning. - I'm sorry
that I have to bother you on Sunday.

01:16:44.121 --> 01:16:46.961
But I was told
that Wolfgang was here.

01:16:47.361 --> 01:16:49.361
Yes, that's right.

01:16:49.721 --> 01:16:50.841
Come on in.

01:16:51.241 --> 01:16:52.321
Thank you very much.

01:16:52.681 --> 01:16:54.521
Don't be afraid. No one will harm you.

01:16:54.921 --> 01:16:57.361
The boy's telling us
some very adventurous stories.

01:16:58.481 --> 01:17:00.572
Would you like some coffee?
- Very kind of you,

01:17:00.921 --> 01:17:03.001
but I can't stay.
- Okay.

01:17:04.441 --> 01:17:05.881
Good morning.

01:17:06.321 --> 01:17:08.281
And who are you?

01:17:08.641 --> 01:17:09.841
I'm not going back!

01:17:10.481 --> 01:17:11.481
Excuse me.

01:17:13.481 --> 01:17:15.401
What's wrong with you?

01:17:19.401 --> 01:17:20.441
That's enough!

01:17:22.441 --> 01:17:23.761
What's going on there?

01:17:25.201 --> 01:17:28.441
I don't know what your son told you.
- I'd like to talk to you.

01:17:37.481 --> 01:17:39.121
What's going on at your institution?

01:17:39.481 --> 01:17:42.681
Wolfgang is emaciated!
- Nonsense! - Emaciated!

01:17:43.121 --> 01:17:46.521
Of course. And he's being beaten.
- He just hit me himself!

01:17:46.921 --> 01:17:48.681
You just saw it.

01:17:49.121 --> 01:17:52.161
Come on, let's play.
- And one or two slaps...

01:17:52.521 --> 01:17:53.521
What?

01:17:54.601 --> 01:17:56.681
I got this for Christmas.

01:17:57.641 --> 01:17:58.641
Here.

01:18:00.361 --> 01:18:02.561
And you buy things in my shop.

01:18:03.001 --> 01:18:04.441
Yeah, that's a good idea.

01:18:04.601 --> 01:18:08.281
Why? - Wait. I'm not acting on
feeling here. I'm going to take a look.

01:18:10.361 --> 01:18:12.281
Sweets

01:18:12.641 --> 01:18:15.401
and apples, cherries,

01:18:15.761 --> 01:18:17.321
strawberries...

01:18:18.001 --> 01:18:21.961
Your mother wants to see our place
with her own eyes. - Birgit,

01:18:22.641 --> 01:18:26.121
take care of Benno.
You and Wolfi can play later. - Yeah.

01:18:26.841 --> 01:18:28.401
Come on, get dressed.

01:18:35.801 --> 01:18:39.457
What was that supposed to mean? - Do me
just one favor. - I'm the man of this house!

01:18:39.481 --> 01:18:42.881
No, I'm the mother!
- You mother!

01:18:46.481 --> 01:18:49.681
Know what, Wolfgang?
I've been in Freistatt for 25 years.

01:18:50.121 --> 01:18:51.561
You and your son...

01:18:58.321 --> 01:18:59.521
Coming?

01:20:04.441 --> 01:20:05.561
Mom!

01:20:06.761 --> 01:20:07.961
Mom!

01:20:10.681 --> 01:20:11.801
Please!

01:20:12.241 --> 01:20:13.401
Get out!

01:20:14.161 --> 01:20:15.161
Please!

01:20:15.801 --> 01:20:16.801
Get out!

01:20:17.281 --> 01:20:18.721
Don't listen to him!

01:20:19.521 --> 01:20:21.201
Don't listen to him!

01:20:26.401 --> 01:20:30.441
Look at this! Look what they do!
- I'm fed up!

01:20:30.801 --> 01:20:32.201
Look what they do!

01:20:33.361 --> 01:20:35.441
Please, come on!
- Please, drive away!

01:21:07.481 --> 01:21:08.761
You little piece of shit!

01:21:09.721 --> 01:21:11.561
No more trouble from you!

01:21:12.001 --> 01:21:13.001
Come on.

01:21:34.681 --> 01:21:35.881
Get down!

01:21:37.321 --> 01:21:38.321
Come on!

01:21:50.481 --> 01:21:51.841
Here.

01:21:59.761 --> 01:22:01.561
Stop. Dig.

01:22:02.001 --> 01:22:03.601
1.70 m by 0.80 m.

01:22:06.041 --> 01:22:07.361
Do it!

01:22:25.721 --> 01:22:26.881
Move it!

01:22:35.281 --> 01:22:36.601
Let me out!

01:22:46.561 --> 01:22:47.607
Hands behind your back!

01:23:00.761 --> 01:23:02.161
Pale like a bear's nuts.

01:23:09.481 --> 01:23:11.401
Please...
- Dig!

01:23:11.761 --> 01:23:12.801
Get started!

01:23:15.841 --> 01:23:17.241
Come on, bury him!

01:23:23.321 --> 01:23:24.321
Bury him!

01:23:24.721 --> 01:23:25.721
Move it!

01:23:52.761 --> 01:23:53.761
Hey, how does it feel?

01:23:59.321 --> 01:24:00.441
I won't do that.

01:24:01.321 --> 01:24:04.041
What? You won't do that?
- I don't want to.

01:24:10.641 --> 01:24:12.161
You can do it.

01:24:12.521 --> 01:24:14.201
Do it for me!

01:24:14.561 --> 01:24:15.721
Come on!

01:24:16.801 --> 01:24:17.881
Bernd!

01:24:20.481 --> 01:24:21.881
No! No!

01:24:26.841 --> 01:24:29.201
Okay, do it! Do it!

01:24:30.081 --> 01:24:32.001
What's wrong? Are you chicken?

01:24:32.801 --> 01:24:35.081
You coward! Do it!

01:24:35.481 --> 01:24:36.521
Do it! Do it!

01:24:41.521 --> 01:24:43.641
Come on, keep going!

01:24:44.521 --> 01:24:45.561
Pick up the shovel!

01:24:46.561 --> 01:24:48.681
Take the shovel!

01:24:49.481 --> 01:24:50.481
Come on!

01:25:05.161 --> 01:25:07.361
Come on! We're going home!

01:26:36.441 --> 01:26:39.761
It's okay, my boy. I'm here.

01:27:16.241 --> 01:27:17.481
"Dear Anton,

01:27:18.241 --> 01:27:20.121
We've finally reached the point."

01:27:22.441 --> 01:27:24.201
Nobody can read that.

01:27:25.521 --> 01:27:26.721
"You're coming home.

01:27:31.601 --> 01:27:32.761
Just one more night.

01:27:33.921 --> 01:27:39.601
We can hardly wait
to... embrace you once more."

01:27:40.921 --> 01:27:43.321
"Embrace" with no R! Christ, Anton!

01:27:44.361 --> 01:27:47.721
"We love you more than ever.
Mom and Dad."

01:28:06.281 --> 01:28:07.761
What's going on here?

01:28:08.561 --> 01:28:10.641
Get moving! Brush your teeth!

01:28:11.081 --> 01:28:13.121
Get dressed! Hey?

01:28:27.401 --> 01:28:29.121
Where's that wimp?

01:28:31.281 --> 01:28:32.481
Are you sleeping again?

01:28:32.881 --> 01:28:34.161
Good morning!

01:28:37.481 --> 01:28:38.961
Well...

01:28:41.001 --> 01:28:42.281
Okay...

01:28:44.521 --> 01:28:46.441
Don't blame yourselves.

01:28:47.841 --> 01:28:49.281
It...

01:28:50.921 --> 01:28:52.361
He was weak.

01:28:53.241 --> 01:28:55.521
Negroes are just hard to see in the dark.

01:28:58.641 --> 01:29:00.201
Come on, get to work.

01:29:05.361 --> 01:29:06.641
Here.

01:29:07.081 --> 01:29:08.401
For your collection.

01:29:12.481 --> 01:29:13.841
Yeah.

01:29:14.481 --> 01:29:15.761
Get to work.

01:29:18.001 --> 01:29:20.841
Ridiculous.
You two, get him outta here.

01:29:25.201 --> 01:29:26.201
Brother Hanebuth,

01:29:26.521 --> 01:29:27.681
come here!

01:29:34.641 --> 01:29:36.121
Come on out, Hanebuth!

01:29:37.801 --> 01:29:39.983
You were just a little squirt
when you came here.

01:29:43.881 --> 01:29:45.521
If that's what you want...

01:29:47.201 --> 01:29:48.281
Give me that!

01:29:58.721 --> 01:29:59.801
Go away!

01:30:06.721 --> 01:30:07.721
You monster!

01:30:11.161 --> 01:30:13.361
No! No!

01:30:14.361 --> 01:30:16.641
You'll never learn,
you piece of shit!

01:30:30.681 --> 01:30:32.121
You've left me here alone.

01:30:35.321 --> 01:30:37.281
Yes!
- Yes!

01:30:37.641 --> 01:30:39.681
We're getting outta here! Come on!

01:30:53.681 --> 01:30:55.161
Aren't you coming?

01:31:05.601 --> 01:31:07.561
No!
- Gimme your jacket and trousers.

01:32:03.561 --> 01:32:04.641
Speak freely!

01:32:05.001 --> 01:32:07.161
Thank you, Big Brother Wilde.

01:32:17.441 --> 01:32:19.121
Report for roll call!

01:32:29.761 --> 01:32:30.961
Not you.

01:32:46.201 --> 01:32:48.721
Americans on the moon

01:33:01.321 --> 01:33:04.041
I'm sorry
about your step-father's accident.

01:33:05.321 --> 01:33:08.521
I hope you'll remember some
of the lessons you learned here.

01:33:09.481 --> 01:33:12.121
Good luck and stand tall.

01:33:25.681 --> 01:33:26.681
Catch it!

01:33:28.361 --> 01:33:29.401
Well done.

01:33:30.361 --> 01:33:33.601
Georg. We can use agile hands here.

01:33:38.521 --> 01:33:41.841
You don't say anything.
Tell me, why are you here?

01:34:06.241 --> 01:34:09.281
Birgit? - Yes.
- Did you take the cake outside?

01:34:09.641 --> 01:34:13.721
Of course.
But I want to sit next to Wolfi. - Sure.

01:34:59.121 --> 01:35:01.001
Can you help me with the napkins?

01:35:01.401 --> 01:35:04.417
I'm looking forward to Wolfi.
- Me, too. - Do you think he's changed?

01:35:04.441 --> 01:35:08.361
I don't know. What do you think?
- I don't know. - Maybe a bit.

01:35:08.721 --> 01:35:10.521
Maybe he's matured a bit.

01:35:19.921 --> 01:35:21.961
Hey, Wolfgang!

01:35:22.481 --> 01:35:23.601
Hey, Wolfi!

01:35:24.281 --> 01:35:27.321
I don't believe it. Come here.
- What happened to you?

01:35:27.681 --> 01:35:31.441
I knew you'd be coming home.
My condolences, by the way.

01:35:33.441 --> 01:35:35.961
Hey, could you lend me some money?

01:35:37.881 --> 01:35:39.481
Sure, what do you need?

01:35:39.881 --> 01:35:42.641
I don't know. Maybe 20.

01:35:44.281 --> 01:35:46.201
But hey, make sure you give it back.

01:35:47.561 --> 01:35:49.961
Hard-earned money working for Struve.
- Wolfgang!

01:35:50.881 --> 01:35:52.201
Hey?

01:35:57.001 --> 01:35:58.201
Wait a sec.

01:35:59.361 --> 01:36:02.281
We're going to the lake later.
Want to come with us?

01:36:05.081 --> 01:36:09.361
My mother made a meal.
We're celebrating. - I see.

01:36:09.721 --> 01:36:12.841
I'll stop by this evening.
- Are you coming, Biene?

01:36:13.281 --> 01:36:14.601
Oh, cake!

01:36:20.481 --> 01:36:21.481
Are you crazy?

01:36:27.041 --> 01:36:28.161
Wolfgang!

01:36:29.201 --> 01:36:30.521
Is it broken?

01:36:33.441 --> 01:36:35.081
Fucking asshole!

01:37:47.441 --> 01:37:49.241
Until the 1970s, Freistatt was regarded

01:37:49.441 --> 01:37:52.441
as one of the toughest
juvenile corrective training institutions.

01:37:52.601 --> 01:37:54.801
After 1945
more than 800,000 girls and boys

01:37:55.041 --> 01:37:58.041
lived in about 3,000 such
church and state-run homes in the FRG.

01:37:58.241 --> 01:38:01.481
The German parliament didn't approve
compensation payments until 2010.

01:38:06.721 --> 01:38:09.497
Thanks to Freistatt Welfare Institution,
this film was shot at the original locations.

01:38:09.521 --> 01:38:11.976
Today Freistatt is a modern
social service organisation

01:38:12.161 --> 01:38:15.298
that offers a varied educational
programme for children and teenagers.

01:43:47.921 --> 01:43:51.961
