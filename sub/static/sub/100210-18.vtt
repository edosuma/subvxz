00:00.047 --> 00:02.265
<i>Back in the '90s,
there were so many great movies</i>

00:02.290 --> 00:05.164
<i>about teachers, but one really
inspired Principal Glascott</i>

00:05.219 --> 00:06.601
<i>to get through to the kids
in a whole new way.</i>

00:06.664 --> 00:07.719
They finally did it.

00:07.788 --> 00:09.388
"Good Will Hunting"
is a movie that combines

00:09.456 --> 00:10.902
two of my greatest loves.

00:10.973 --> 00:12.406
Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.

00:12.475 --> 00:14.341
No, I mean teaching and counseling.

00:14.443 --> 00:16.744
But those boys
do have something very special.

00:16.812 --> 00:18.112
Some might even say it's

00:18.180 --> 00:19.547
"wicked awesome."

00:19.649 --> 00:20.748
"How 'bout them apples?"

00:20.816 --> 00:22.049
Right? How 'bout 'em?

00:22.118 --> 00:23.417
You want to
know the one that I don't like?

00:23.519 --> 00:24.685
- What?
- Them grammar.

00:24.787 --> 00:26.420
Them grammar.

00:26.489 --> 00:27.688
You wanted to see me, John?

00:27.757 --> 00:29.523
I wanted to let you know
that CB is going to assist you

00:29.592 --> 00:31.458
at the robotics competition
this weekend.

00:31.561 --> 00:33.627
Wilma. I am ready.

00:33.729 --> 00:35.095
Oh, sure, that makes total sense

00:35.164 --> 00:36.830
because he's an English teacher.

00:36.899 --> 00:39.066
At the last Sharing Circle,
we decided that when teachers

00:39.135 --> 00:41.435
are outside of their area of expertise,

00:41.504 --> 00:43.070
they can lend a unique perspective.

00:43.172 --> 00:44.772
Wilma...

00:44.840 --> 00:48.576
...I am excited to think
outside of the box with you.

00:48.644 --> 00:51.178
Here's my unique perspective...
no thanks.

00:51.247 --> 00:53.747
Sorry, Wilma. Mind made up.

00:55.251 --> 00:57.484
Oh, speaking of which.

00:57.587 --> 00:59.553
Look at this adorable guy.

00:59.622 --> 01:01.155
He's dressed like me.

01:01.257 --> 01:03.290
Hello, little fella.

01:04.927 --> 01:06.893
God! No! Why, God?!

01:06.963 --> 01:08.429
Wilma, did one of your kids make this?

01:08.497 --> 01:10.864
My kids wish they could make
a robot this good.

01:10.967 --> 01:12.600
That is some great work.

01:12.668 --> 01:14.969
It's a prank, and I'm pretty
sure I know the perpetrator!

01:15.037 --> 01:16.737
We need to find him immediately.

01:16.839 --> 01:19.306
CB, the robot bit is over!

01:19.408 --> 01:22.309
<i>♪ One of these days,
you're gonna get outta here ♪</i>

01:22.411 --> 01:25.279
<i>♪ Live your life and finally be free ♪</i>

01:25.381 --> 01:28.248
<i>♪ Go where you wanna go,

01:28.351 --> 01:31.752
<i>♪ Someday, you will say
"Those were the days" ♪</i>

01:31.854 --> 01:34.121
<i>It was April 1st, 1990-something,</i>

01:34.223 --> 01:35.556
<i>and I had recently gotten up the courage</i>

01:35.658 --> 01:37.391
<i>to get my mom's phone number
from my dad.</i>

01:38.714 --> 01:40.643
<i>Actually dialing it
was a whole other story.</i>

01:41.931 --> 01:44.131
<i>I hadn't seen her in like 15 years,</i>

01:44.233 --> 01:46.433
<i>so I was looking for any excuse
to get out of doing it.</i>

01:46.535 --> 01:48.202
Oh! CB, let me help you.

01:48.304 --> 01:49.236
That looks really heavy.

01:53.943 --> 01:56.644
This phone is gross,
and I hate what I'm wearing.

01:56.746 --> 01:58.212
<i>Clearly, I needed some support,</i>

01:58.314 --> 02:00.114
- <i>so I went to the best coach I knew.</i>
- Okay.

02:00.216 --> 02:02.816
Can't believe the next voice
I'm going to hear is my mom's.

02:02.918 --> 02:04.351
You got this.

02:05.688 --> 02:06.754
<i>We're sorry.</i>

02:06.856 --> 02:07.788
<i>You have reached a number</i>

02:07.890 --> 02:09.122
<i>that has been disconnected</i>

02:09.225 --> 02:10.858
<i>or is no longer in service.</i>

02:10.960 --> 02:12.593
You sure you got the right number?

02:12.695 --> 02:14.328
Yeah. It's the number my dad gave me.

02:16.032 --> 02:18.432
Who wrote this?
W-Were they on a trampoline?

02:18.534 --> 02:19.800
No. I wrote it.

02:19.902 --> 02:21.769
- You sure you're right-handed?
- Yes!

02:21.871 --> 02:23.804
Well, this looks like hieroglyphics.

02:23.906 --> 02:27.441
You got a 4, a 7, then an L,
and then you drew a falcon.

02:27.543 --> 02:28.442
Why did you draw a falcon?

02:28.544 --> 02:30.110
No. Okay, we get it.

02:30.212 --> 02:31.111
I have bad penmanship.

02:31.213 --> 02:32.246
I'll have to call my dad

02:32.348 --> 02:33.414
and make sure I wrote down
the number right.

02:33.516 --> 02:35.182
You drew an owl over here.

02:36.919 --> 02:38.886
Caroline, why would you do this?

02:38.988 --> 02:41.255
It'll take me hours
to wash away all this blue.

02:41.357 --> 02:43.157
My shower's gonna look like a scene

02:43.259 --> 02:45.626
from "Psycho," but with the Smurfs.

02:45.728 --> 02:48.028
Wait, did I just
think of a genius movie pitch?

02:48.130 --> 02:49.163
You did not.

02:49.265 --> 02:51.665
But this robot is pretty genius.

02:51.767 --> 02:53.267
The force of the paint,
the distribution...

02:53.369 --> 02:55.335
it is the perfect amount of humiliation.

02:55.438 --> 02:56.670
That's what I was going for.

02:56.772 --> 02:57.971
Well, you know what I'm going for?

02:58.074 --> 02:59.106
Two weeks' detention.

02:59.208 --> 03:01.308
You shouldn't punish genius, John.

03:01.410 --> 03:04.545
It may be genius,
but it's evil genius, Wilma.

03:04.647 --> 03:06.113
Evil, I say!

03:06.215 --> 03:08.048
Well, my robotics team is soft,

03:08.150 --> 03:09.817
and we could use someone like Caroline.

03:09.919 --> 03:12.052
Well, I can't reward her
for what she did.

03:12.154 --> 03:13.787
I don't wanna join her team, okay?

03:13.889 --> 03:15.856
So, it's not a reward.
I'd rather take detention.

03:15.958 --> 03:18.125
There you go. Detention's the reward.

03:18.227 --> 03:20.494
Putting her on my robotics team
is the punishment.

03:20.596 --> 03:22.696
Okay, fine. We'll do it your way.

03:22.798 --> 03:24.064
But with CB's help.

03:24.166 --> 03:25.833
What does an English teacher
know about robotics?

03:25.935 --> 03:27.201
Boy, I do like you.

03:28.471 --> 03:29.803
So, what'd your dad say?

03:29.905 --> 03:31.605
Turns out he had the wrong number.

03:31.707 --> 03:32.973
Then he went on some rant how my mom

03:33.075 --> 03:34.675
is probably a carnie or a drug mule now.

03:34.777 --> 03:35.809
That's highly unlikely.

03:35.911 --> 03:38.011
Those two jobs require
very different skill sets.

03:38.114 --> 03:39.847
He also told me he heard
she lives in Altoona now.

03:39.949 --> 03:41.415
That's only a couple hours away.

03:41.484 --> 03:44.485
Yeah. I might go visit during the break.

03:44.553 --> 03:47.121
But, you know, I-I might get
a summer teaching gig.

03:47.189 --> 03:48.622
I might want to travel, find myself.

03:48.724 --> 03:50.090
There's many things to do.

03:50.192 --> 03:51.358
You know what I hate, Lainey?

03:51.427 --> 03:52.726
Hippies? Russians? Poodles?

03:52.795 --> 03:53.994
Waiters that tell you their names?

03:54.063 --> 03:55.829
Actually, I came around on
that one when, uh,

03:55.931 --> 03:58.065
my good buddy Lance from TGI Fridays

03:58.100 --> 04:00.067
turned me on to cilantro.

04:00.136 --> 04:01.835
No, but what I hate is excuses,

04:01.937 --> 04:03.604
and that's what I hear you making.

04:03.706 --> 04:05.372
Now, you wanted me
to push you to do this.

04:05.441 --> 04:08.876
To call her. But... seeing her?

04:08.944 --> 04:10.477
I mean, I need a little more time, Rick.

04:10.546 --> 04:13.213
All right. I know when not
to push my players too hard.

04:13.315 --> 04:14.348
I'll tell you what.

04:14.416 --> 04:16.116
What say we go down to TGI Fridays

04:16.185 --> 04:17.618
and my good buddy Lance hooks us up

04:17.685 --> 04:19.353
with some barbecue quesadillas?

04:19.421 --> 04:20.553
That actually sounds great.

04:20.623 --> 04:22.322
I could really use
some fried stuff right now.

04:22.391 --> 04:24.391
<i>While Rick was helping me,
Wilma was trying to help</i>

04:24.460 --> 04:25.959
<i>her chances at the robotics competition.</i>

04:26.028 --> 04:27.761
Everyone, meet your new teammate.

04:27.863 --> 04:29.997
Caroline Dillon? Seriously?

04:30.099 --> 04:32.099
Don't explode any paint bombs in here.

04:32.168 --> 04:34.201
These are my only glasses with
an up-to-date prescription.

04:34.270 --> 04:36.637
Calm down. She's not here
to blow anything up.

04:36.739 --> 04:37.604
Right?

04:37.706 --> 04:39.139
Fine.

04:39.208 --> 04:41.542
Did you just glue a skateboard
to a watering can

04:41.644 --> 04:43.110
and stick a baseball mitt on top?

04:43.179 --> 04:44.711
It's designed to carry an egg.

04:44.814 --> 04:46.446
Well, I bet it can carry stupid.

04:46.549 --> 04:49.183
You can't carry stupid.
That's an abstract concept.

04:49.251 --> 04:51.218
Yeah, that's what I thought,
too, until I saw your robot.

04:51.320 --> 04:53.754
Now, let's remember that there
are no stupid ideas.

04:53.823 --> 04:56.490
There are, however, better ideas
than Mr. Eggbot,

04:56.592 --> 04:58.458
which is why I brought in
some fresh blood.

04:58.527 --> 05:00.928
Yeah, this is actually way too lame.

05:01.030 --> 05:02.229
I can't do this, Ms. Howell.

05:02.298 --> 05:04.928
I can't dumb it down just to
make these scrubs feel better.

05:04.967 --> 05:07.000
- I'm out.
- Hey, wait. Don't go.

05:07.102 --> 05:08.969
How about this... these guys can make

05:09.038 --> 05:10.504
their Eggbot, and you can make your own.

05:10.573 --> 05:12.773
It'll be like tryouts
for the real competition.

05:12.875 --> 05:14.141
- I'd do that.
- Okay.

05:14.210 --> 05:15.742
May the best robot win.

05:15.811 --> 05:17.477
Oh, this is getting interesting.

05:17.580 --> 05:19.313
It wasn't interesting before?

05:19.415 --> 05:20.914
Wilma, can I see you over there

05:20.983 --> 05:23.035
for <i>un momento, por favor</i>, please?

05:24.587 --> 05:26.553
Listen, I thought you were
supposed to be teaching

05:26.655 --> 05:28.188
the kids about teamwork.

05:28.257 --> 05:29.389
It is teamwork.

05:29.458 --> 05:31.792
They're working as two separate teams.

05:31.861 --> 05:33.093
You know what this reminds me of?

05:33.162 --> 05:35.262
The classic novel,
"The Three Musketeers."

05:35.331 --> 05:38.031
Oh, interesting, and super
relevant to the task at hand.

05:38.100 --> 05:40.901
Well, originally, the musketeers
were enemies with D'Artagnan,

05:40.970 --> 05:42.636
and then they realized
that they were stronger

05:42.738 --> 05:44.004
when they worked together, okay?

05:44.073 --> 05:46.273
And that's when they truly
became "all for one."

05:46.375 --> 05:48.876
I know you're trying to help me,
but now I'm just hungry

05:48.944 --> 05:50.444
for a Three Musketeers bar.

05:50.546 --> 05:53.513
<i>While CB was coaching Wilma,
Coach had his own plans for me.</i>

05:53.582 --> 05:55.415
Hey, we just passed TGI Fridays.

05:55.484 --> 05:56.550
We're not going there.

05:56.619 --> 05:59.086
Lance doesn't even work there today.

05:59.154 --> 06:00.621
Well, there are other servers, Rick.

06:00.723 --> 06:02.589
It's not about that.

06:02.691 --> 06:03.757
We're going to Altoona.

06:03.859 --> 06:05.058
Wait, what?

06:05.127 --> 06:07.728
- Are you serious? You're kidnapping me?
- I'm not kidnapping you.

06:07.796 --> 06:09.463
Kidnapping is taking
a kid away from a parent.

06:09.565 --> 06:11.231
I'm returning a kid to a parent.

06:11.300 --> 06:14.635
So, I'm... I'm un-napping you
or possibly de-napping you.

06:14.737 --> 06:16.670
No, you don't have to do this.

06:16.772 --> 06:18.705
I will do it. Myself. Later.

06:18.807 --> 06:20.340
I promise.

06:20.442 --> 06:21.375
Maybe next weekend.

06:21.443 --> 06:23.043
Or I travel and find myself.

06:23.112 --> 06:26.013
That way, I can show her
vacation photos I took.

06:29.685 --> 06:32.019
Look, Lainey,
if you don't want to do this,

06:32.087 --> 06:34.655
I can turn around
and we can go home right now.

06:34.723 --> 06:36.757
- Okay.
- Hear me out.

06:36.859 --> 06:39.059
I had a huge falling out
with my stepfather,

06:39.128 --> 06:41.028
and we didn't talk for 10 years.

06:41.130 --> 06:43.096
Well, we have that fun thing in common.

06:43.165 --> 06:44.498
Look, I don't know if talking to him

06:44.566 --> 06:47.267
would have made things better or worse,

06:47.336 --> 06:49.970
but I wish I could have found out.

06:50.039 --> 06:53.140
You still have a chance to find out.

06:53.208 --> 06:55.208
All right.

06:55.311 --> 06:56.443
Let's do this.

06:57.947 --> 07:00.013
<i>Mellor had shared
a personal story with me,</i>

07:00.115 --> 07:02.149
<i>while Glascott was sharing
his bootleg copy</i>

07:02.251 --> 07:03.417
<i>of "Good Will Hunting" with someone</i>

07:03.519 --> 07:05.085
<i>he thought would appreciate it the most.</i>

07:05.187 --> 07:07.254
See? You're both maintenance workers.

07:07.323 --> 07:08.455
That's pretty cool, huh?

07:08.557 --> 07:09.856
This makes me believe one day,

07:09.925 --> 07:11.892
I, too, could janitor
at the Ivy League level.

07:11.961 --> 07:13.527
Maybe you can, son.

07:13.595 --> 07:15.862
Maybe you can.

07:15.931 --> 07:17.497
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

07:17.566 --> 07:18.532
<i>I know.</i>

07:18.634 --> 07:20.567
<i>It's not your fault, all right?</i>

07:20.669 --> 07:21.835
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

07:21.904 --> 07:24.504
It's true! It's not his fault!

07:24.606 --> 07:27.140
Why won't he listen?
Accept the help, man!

07:27.242 --> 07:28.241
Oh, Wilma.

07:28.310 --> 07:29.910
You made it just in time
for the third act.

07:30.012 --> 07:31.345
As much as I love to watch movies,

07:31.447 --> 07:32.479
I've got robotics club,

07:32.581 --> 07:34.047
and CB can't be left in there alone.

07:34.116 --> 07:37.050
Break dancing in the science lab
just leads to breaking things.

07:37.152 --> 07:38.952
Speaking of which,
how's it going with Caroline?

07:39.054 --> 07:39.953
That's why I came in here.

07:40.022 --> 07:41.621
To tell you to come see for yourself.

07:41.690 --> 07:43.757
I have to say, Wilma,
I applaud how you stepped in

07:43.859 --> 07:45.425
to help that troubled genius.

07:45.527 --> 07:47.094
Oh, my God!

07:47.196 --> 07:48.929
You're "Good Wilma Hunting."

07:48.998 --> 07:50.831
Ha. I see what you did.

07:50.933 --> 07:52.766
I added an "m-a" to the "Will."

07:52.868 --> 07:53.934
- Is that what you saw?
- Yes.

07:54.003 --> 07:55.702
Yeah, good. 'Cause that's what I did.

07:58.273 --> 07:59.373
Hey, guys.

07:59.441 --> 08:01.773
Get your robots ready to demonstrate
for Principal Glascott.

08:01.798 --> 08:04.444
Wait, they're doing them separately?
Isn't this a team?

08:04.513 --> 08:05.946
- That's what I've been saying.
- Trust me.

08:06.048 --> 08:08.682
This friendly competition
will guarantee the best robot.

08:08.751 --> 08:10.450
Y'all ready for this?

08:10.519 --> 08:13.020
Mr. Eggbot!

08:16.759 --> 08:17.858
Ooh.

08:17.926 --> 08:20.160
This robot is egg-cellent.

08:21.263 --> 08:22.863
Okay, I'm sorry.

08:22.931 --> 08:25.399
Now, let's see what Caroline's can do.

08:30.105 --> 08:30.971
- No!
- No!

08:31.073 --> 08:32.039
- No!
- No!

08:32.140 --> 08:33.140
- No!
- No!

08:33.241 --> 08:35.142
- Ooh!
- No!

08:40.515 --> 08:41.948
No!

08:42.051 --> 08:42.982
Oh, God!

08:43.085 --> 08:44.951
No! Why, God?! Why?!

08:45.054 --> 08:46.853
Sorry. I guess the best robot won.

08:46.955 --> 08:49.022
Caroline, that is not okay!

08:51.326 --> 08:52.793
- My robot!
- Great.

08:52.895 --> 08:54.461
Now we have no robot
for the competition.

08:54.563 --> 08:57.040
You know, this reminds me
of the classic novel,

08:57.097 --> 08:58.641
"Wilma Should Have Listened to CB."

09:01.423 --> 09:02.931
<i>Rick was taking me to see my mom,</i>

09:03.009 --> 09:05.048
<i>and the closer we got,
the more nervous I got.</i>

09:05.111 --> 09:06.572
I hope this isn't a bad idea.

09:06.651 --> 09:08.350
We could find my mom
in a hillbilly roadhouse

09:08.419 --> 09:11.887
with a bunch of guys snapping
her bra straps for wine coolers.

09:11.956 --> 09:13.322
My dad's words, not mine.

09:13.391 --> 09:15.217
It's how they met, apparently.

09:17.728 --> 09:19.495
Well, this doesn't look like
a hillbilly roadhouse.

09:19.564 --> 09:21.730
No. The neighborhood
doesn't seem like it's zoned

09:21.799 --> 09:22.798
for that kind of thing.

09:22.867 --> 09:24.500
We don't know her life now.

09:24.602 --> 09:26.936
Remarried? Job? Kids?

09:27.038 --> 09:28.104
Do I have stepsiblings?

09:28.172 --> 09:29.672
We don't know what's behind
those doors, Rick.

09:29.707 --> 09:31.907
I think I know a really good way
to find out.

09:31.976 --> 09:33.109
Come on. Let's go.

09:35.646 --> 09:37.379
I'm so nervous to see her face-to-face.

09:39.617 --> 09:41.984
Oh, my God. Lainey?

09:42.053 --> 09:43.052
Hi, Mom.

09:43.121 --> 09:44.186
Look at you.

09:44.255 --> 09:46.722
You... You're so grown-up.

09:46.791 --> 09:48.224
Well, it's been a long time.

09:48.326 --> 09:49.425
Uh, Rick Mellor.

09:49.494 --> 09:51.393
Um, friend, co-worker,
and reunion specialist.

09:55.032 --> 09:57.566
You'll have to excuse
Buttercup and Duffy.

09:57.635 --> 09:59.969
They're a little antsy
after sitting for 45 minutes

10:00.071 --> 10:01.504
while I painted their portrait.

10:01.572 --> 10:02.638
Gosh, look at those.

10:02.707 --> 10:03.939
There's so many, too.

10:04.008 --> 10:07.143
Yeah. It's pretty hard to paint
a bad picture of these two.

10:07.245 --> 10:10.679
So... whatcha been up to?

10:10.748 --> 10:12.181
Wow. 15 years. Okay.

10:12.283 --> 10:13.516
Well, a lot has happened.

10:13.584 --> 10:15.584
Um, I'll just give you
the greatest hits.

10:15.653 --> 10:17.019
In high school, I started a band.

10:17.088 --> 10:17.987
Oh, fun.

10:18.055 --> 10:19.722
You always had a beautiful voice.

10:19.824 --> 10:21.524
Thank you.

10:21.592 --> 10:22.625
So, I moved to Hollywood

10:22.693 --> 10:24.493
to, um, try to make it on my own.

10:24.562 --> 10:26.028
Well, you're better as a solo act.

10:27.064 --> 10:29.331
Anyway, I, um... I moved back to Philly,

10:29.400 --> 10:31.133
and, uh... Oh, my gosh.

10:31.202 --> 10:32.201
I'm dating Barry Goldberg.

10:32.303 --> 10:35.070
Oh. I remember that boy.

10:35.173 --> 10:36.572
Did he ever grow into that hair?

10:36.674 --> 10:38.007
He did not.

10:38.075 --> 10:39.775
Yeah, it's been a pretty
crazy ride with him.

10:39.844 --> 10:41.877
We actually got engaged
and then we broke it off

10:41.979 --> 10:43.078
and we were apart for a couple years.

10:43.147 --> 10:44.380
Now we're back together.

10:44.448 --> 10:45.881
It's long distance, but it's
actually going pretty well.

10:45.983 --> 10:48.784
I'm so glad you guys
found each other again.

10:48.853 --> 10:50.719
And now I'm a music teacher
at William Penn.

10:50.821 --> 10:52.121
I'm also the cheerleading coach.

10:52.223 --> 10:53.155
Oh, my God.

10:53.257 --> 10:55.391
It feels like literally yesterday

10:55.493 --> 10:56.892
you were a cheerleader there.

10:56.994 --> 10:58.027
You remember that?

10:58.129 --> 10:59.695
Of course I do.

10:59.764 --> 11:02.264
I'm so happy things are going well.

11:02.366 --> 11:03.666
Yeah, they are.

11:03.768 --> 11:05.801
Despite, you know, everything.

11:05.870 --> 11:07.069
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I'm guessing

11:07.138 --> 11:08.671
this is Duffy's favorite chair?

11:08.773 --> 11:10.072
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

11:10.174 --> 11:11.207
I'll take them out. Come on, guys.

11:11.309 --> 11:12.241
- Let's go, let's go.
- Not his fault.

11:12.310 --> 11:14.376
Probably drawn to my alpha energy.

11:14.478 --> 11:16.579
Yeah...

11:20.384 --> 11:22.218
So, your mom seems
like she's doing great.

11:22.286 --> 11:23.953
I'm not buying it.
This is what she used to do.

11:24.021 --> 11:25.287
She'd pull it together
in front of company,

11:25.356 --> 11:27.590
and then she'd go to one
of her many booze hiding spots.

11:27.658 --> 11:30.125
She'd hide her mini airplane
bottles in a cookie jar.

11:31.429 --> 11:33.929
Ooh, Nutter Butters. Ha, ha!

11:34.031 --> 11:37.066
Mm. Nope. Dog treats.

11:37.134 --> 11:39.501
Seems like your mom really has changed.

11:39.604 --> 11:40.769
Yeah, maybe.

11:40.838 --> 11:42.504
Why are you still eating the dog treat?

11:42.573 --> 11:44.006
'Cause I'm not a quitter.

11:46.544 --> 11:48.844
Lainey. Lainey, stop.

11:48.913 --> 11:50.813
It's okay, Rick.

11:50.915 --> 11:53.649
She has every reason not to trust me.

11:53.751 --> 11:54.717
Heck, when Lainey was a kid,

11:54.819 --> 11:58.153
I-I did hide booze all over the house.

11:58.222 --> 11:59.521
But I'm clean now.

11:59.590 --> 12:02.024
Wait, for real?
Y-You're not drinking anymore?

12:02.126 --> 12:04.793
No. I swear.

12:04.895 --> 12:06.528
I'm in a program.

12:06.597 --> 12:08.130
I-I have a meeting tonight.

12:08.232 --> 12:11.934
I'm... I'm getting
a milestone chip for sobriety.

12:12.036 --> 12:13.235
Really?

12:13.337 --> 12:14.570
Why don't you come with me?

12:14.639 --> 12:15.904
I mean, you can see for yourself.

12:15.973 --> 12:17.840
Things are different now.

12:17.942 --> 12:19.541
Um... o-okay. Yeah.

12:19.644 --> 12:20.676
I'm here, right?

12:22.480 --> 12:24.013
Uh, Rick, would you like to join us?

12:24.115 --> 12:25.614
- I'd be honored.
- Great.

12:25.683 --> 12:27.449
Yeah, it's probably
not a good idea for you

12:27.551 --> 12:29.518
to be alone in the house with the dogs.

12:29.587 --> 12:32.187
I mean, Duffy's sweet,
but, uh, he definitely

12:32.256 --> 12:34.323
is gonna hold a grudge
for you taking his seat.

12:34.392 --> 12:35.724
<i>I was starting to see that my mom</i>

12:35.793 --> 12:37.326
<i>wasn't the mess I thought she'd be.</i>

12:37.428 --> 12:39.395
<i>Meanwhile, Wilma was cleaning
up the messy aftermath</i>

12:39.497 --> 12:40.629
<i>of the robot battle.</i>

12:40.731 --> 12:42.598
I escorted Caroline to detention.

12:42.667 --> 12:44.199
I guess I'm not Good Wilma Hunting.

12:44.302 --> 12:45.901
I'm Bad Wilma Hunting.

12:45.970 --> 12:47.169
Don't be so hard on yourself.

12:47.271 --> 12:48.370
You were right to try.

12:48.439 --> 12:50.472
I created a monster,
and the monster I created

12:50.541 --> 12:53.142
created a monster who destroyed
cute, little Eggbot,

12:53.210 --> 12:55.778
whose only crime was wanting
to carry an egg five inches.

12:55.880 --> 12:58.147
Wilma... it's not your fault.

12:58.249 --> 13:00.649
What are you talking about?
I warned her and she did it.

13:00.718 --> 13:01.817
How is that not her fault?

13:04.121 --> 13:06.121
It's not your fault.

13:06.190 --> 13:07.222
Oh, I see what you're doing there.

13:07.291 --> 13:08.390
You're doing that thing from the movie?

13:08.459 --> 13:10.826
Yeah, it was a beautiful,
heartfelt moment,

13:10.895 --> 13:12.294
and it totally changed my opinion

13:12.363 --> 13:14.029
of what Robin Williams
could do as an actor.

13:14.131 --> 13:15.798
Wilma, it's not your fault.

13:15.900 --> 13:17.599
Yeah. It's Caroline's fault.

13:17.702 --> 13:19.101
Having been privy to it all,

13:19.170 --> 13:20.769
I would love to offer you
my perspective.

13:20.845 --> 13:22.453
- I feel like...
- CB, nobody wants to hear

13:22.493 --> 13:23.609
your ideas or thoughts.

13:23.703 --> 13:26.442
I mean, Caroline
is just this know-it-all

13:26.544 --> 13:28.610
who won't listen to anyone's
ideas or thoughts.

13:28.679 --> 13:29.912
She just does what she wants.

13:29.980 --> 13:31.380
Who does she think she is?

13:31.449 --> 13:33.282
Hmm. And who does that sound like?

13:33.384 --> 13:34.917
My Aunt Denise.

13:34.985 --> 13:36.585
I told her she couldn't afford a boat,

13:36.654 --> 13:39.254
she bought a boat, now she's
a lady living on a boat.

13:39.323 --> 13:41.423
Okay, well, it's nice to know
someone with a boat,

13:41.492 --> 13:43.659
but does anyone else come to mind?

13:43.728 --> 13:45.160
The lady at the deli counter.

13:45.196 --> 13:47.363
She keeps telling me to get the combo.

13:47.465 --> 13:48.797
I don't want the combo.

13:48.899 --> 13:52.534
I just want a sandwich
and a drink, not the chips.

13:54.138 --> 13:55.771
Oh, my God.

13:55.873 --> 13:57.272
Caroline is me.

13:57.341 --> 13:58.907
She sure is.

13:58.976 --> 14:00.776
How do you like them apples?

14:03.114 --> 14:04.880
And now we have another chip to give out

14:04.949 --> 14:07.049
to mark a sobriety milestone.

14:07.151 --> 14:08.951
Deb, come on up.

14:09.019 --> 14:10.219
Whoo!

14:10.321 --> 14:12.654
Uh, I just want to thank everyone

14:12.757 --> 14:14.623
in this room for all your support.

14:14.692 --> 14:17.359
I am especially grateful
that my daughter, Lainey,

14:17.461 --> 14:20.295
is here today, and that means
the world to me.

14:20.398 --> 14:21.764
I'm proud of you, Mom.

14:23.300 --> 14:25.534
I can't believe my mom has been
sober for a whole year.

14:25.636 --> 14:28.404
Congratulations on five years sober.

14:28.472 --> 14:29.872
Wait, what?

14:29.940 --> 14:32.674
She's been sober for five years
and she never called me?

14:32.743 --> 14:35.711
And I know Deb's two sponsees
would like to say a few words.

14:35.780 --> 14:37.980
Maybe she was using the five
years to work on herself

14:38.082 --> 14:39.715
and she wasn't ready to be a mother yet.

14:39.784 --> 14:43.652
Deb has been basically like my mom.

14:43.721 --> 14:45.788
Deb's been like, uh, my mom, too.

14:45.890 --> 14:47.823
Huh. Not ready to be a mother yet?

14:47.925 --> 14:49.057
But way prettier.

14:49.160 --> 14:50.359
And not dead.

14:50.428 --> 14:53.395
I knew if I came here
I'd get hurt again.

14:58.235 --> 14:59.968
<i>After my mom's stunning
admission at the meeting,</i>

15:00.037 --> 15:01.136
<i>I needed some time alone,</i>

15:01.238 --> 15:02.738
<i>which Coach wasn't gonna let me have.</i>

15:04.975 --> 15:07.676
Come on, Lainey. Open up.

15:07.778 --> 15:08.911
Lainey.

15:10.414 --> 15:11.613
All right.

15:11.715 --> 15:12.848
I guess you win.

15:12.917 --> 15:14.283
Nothing much I...

15:15.920 --> 15:17.319
Come on, Lainey.

15:17.421 --> 15:19.021
We'll go get mozzarella sticks.

15:19.123 --> 15:20.823
I'll eat fried cheese for you.

15:23.861 --> 15:25.160
She's not supposed
to be their mom, Rick.

15:25.262 --> 15:26.762
She's supposed to be my mom.

15:26.864 --> 15:28.063
I understand. Sometimes...

15:28.165 --> 15:29.898
Hey. What's going on?

15:30.000 --> 15:31.266
What's going on?

15:34.405 --> 15:37.172
What's going on is that you've
been sober for five years

15:37.241 --> 15:39.208
and didn't even think
to reach out to me?

15:39.310 --> 15:41.043
Do you know where I was five years ago?

15:41.145 --> 15:42.544
I-I was broke and in Hollywood.

15:42.646 --> 15:44.313
I had no clue what to do with my life

15:44.381 --> 15:45.747
and I really could've used a mom.

15:45.816 --> 15:48.016
Why didn't you reach out
to me after you got clean?

15:48.118 --> 15:49.551
I mean, five years?

15:49.653 --> 15:52.321
I came close. So many times.

15:52.389 --> 15:54.089
Right before I got my last
five-year chip,

15:54.158 --> 15:57.259
which I didn't get
because I fell off again, hard.

15:57.328 --> 15:59.995
And when I got sober, I didn't
know how long it would last.

16:00.097 --> 16:01.163
I still don't know.

16:01.265 --> 16:03.131
So, we're just not supposed
to have a relationship

16:03.234 --> 16:05.067
because of something that might happen?

16:05.169 --> 16:07.369
I thought if there was
any chance that I could

16:07.471 --> 16:09.538
hurt you again, I-I just couldn't do it.

16:09.640 --> 16:11.406
What if it's what I wanted?

16:11.509 --> 16:13.442
Don't I get a say
in something like this?

16:13.544 --> 16:16.712
Well, I guess I didn't...
I didn't think of it like that.

16:16.814 --> 16:17.946
Yeah, I guess you didn't.

16:18.048 --> 16:19.781
Now you have plenty of time
to think about it.

16:19.884 --> 16:21.984
Come on.

16:32.264 --> 16:34.162
<i>Wilma had seen herself in Caroline,</i>

16:34.232 --> 16:36.174
<i>and now she had some
good advice to pass on.</i>

16:36.250 --> 16:38.369
So, I guess you ended up
in detention anyway.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.822
Eh. Gave me a chance
to perfect my catapult.

16:40.885 --> 16:42.775
Do you know why your robot fried itself?

16:42.869 --> 16:44.921
Yeah. I guess I may have used

16:45.023 --> 16:46.454
a battery with way too many amps.

16:46.524 --> 16:48.858
Caroline, just because you're
the smartest kid in the room

16:48.927 --> 16:50.532
doesn't mean you know everything.

16:50.587 --> 16:52.487
Life is a group project,

16:52.556 --> 16:55.423
and you'll find that other
people have good ideas, too.

16:55.492 --> 16:57.091
It's a lesson I'm still learning myself.

16:57.160 --> 16:58.293
I hear you.

16:58.361 --> 17:00.895
I missed out on a whole bunch
of chips and boat rides.

17:00.997 --> 17:02.397
I get that less.

17:02.466 --> 17:04.665
And if you ever feel like
talking about anything,

17:04.733 --> 17:08.470
from one misunderstood
genius to another...

17:08.571 --> 17:10.003
I'm here.

17:10.073 --> 17:11.539
Thank you, Ms. Howell.

17:11.608 --> 17:13.241
<i>Wilma had gotten through to Caroline.</i>

17:13.343 --> 17:15.376
<i>Meanwhile, I was trying
to leave my mom in the past</i>

17:15.479 --> 17:16.743
<i>and get through to my cheerleaders.</i>

17:16.847 --> 17:18.946
Time, time, time!

17:19.015 --> 17:20.315
Okay, ladies, it's your time!

17:20.416 --> 17:21.583
Let's get out there and do this!

17:21.685 --> 17:22.884
I'm proud of you!

17:40.170 --> 17:41.236
Good job tonight, girls.

17:45.041 --> 17:46.040
What are you doing here?

17:46.109 --> 17:49.511
I know I missed a lot
in the past in person,

17:49.613 --> 17:51.713
but just so you know,

17:51.781 --> 17:55.350
I was always thinking about you.

17:55.452 --> 17:56.851
You kept all these pictures of me?

17:56.920 --> 17:58.820
Of course.

17:58.889 --> 18:00.088
And this newspaper clipping?

18:00.156 --> 18:02.557
Yeah. I look at that all the time.

18:02.626 --> 18:04.025
It's me and Erica.

18:04.127 --> 18:07.695
Listen, I know I can't
make up for not being there,

18:07.764 --> 18:09.931
but if you'd let me, I would love

18:10.033 --> 18:12.100
to be part of your life again.

18:14.004 --> 18:16.471
Okay.

18:16.540 --> 18:18.540
But let's take it slowly.

18:18.642 --> 18:19.641
One day at a time.

18:19.709 --> 18:22.076
Well, I know I can do that.

18:23.380 --> 18:24.646
Thank you for coming.

18:29.686 --> 18:33.821
<i>Sometimes in life, we have
to give people second chances.</i>

18:33.890 --> 18:37.025
Hey.

18:37.093 --> 18:39.227
I was wondering if you guys
still had room on your team.

18:39.329 --> 18:41.229
I have some great ideas for Eggbot Two.

18:41.298 --> 18:43.231
I mean, along with all
of your good ideas.

18:49.873 --> 18:52.273
<i>A chance for them to prove
that the person they once were</i>

18:52.342 --> 18:54.742
<i>isn't who they're always going to be.</i>

18:54.811 --> 18:56.844
You know, this reminds me
of a book called,

18:56.913 --> 18:58.780
"I'm Sorry, CB, I Was a Big Dope.

18:58.848 --> 19:00.915
You're a Valuable Member of the Team."

19:01.017 --> 19:02.750
Classic book, clunky title.

19:02.852 --> 19:04.652
But don't worry. We're good.

19:04.721 --> 19:07.288
Now let's go help these kids
put Eggbot back together.

19:07.390 --> 19:09.924
All for one and one for all.

19:11.861 --> 19:12.961
Let's go.

19:15.365 --> 19:18.132
<i>Because the truth is, people can change,</i>

19:18.201 --> 19:21.736
<i>and often for the better.</i>

19:21.838 --> 19:24.772
<i>You just have to keep
an open mind and an open heart.</i>

19:24.874 --> 19:27.008
<i>And at the end of the day,</i>

19:27.110 --> 19:29.477
<i>nothing feels greater than
watching the important people</i>

19:29.579 --> 19:33.348
<i>in our lives aspire to be the
best versions of themselves.</i>

19:45.695 --> 19:47.061
<i>Because in doing that,</i>

19:47.163 --> 19:50.365
<i>it helps you become
the best version of yourself.</i>

19:54.559 --> 19:55.625
You can do it.

19:55.727 --> 19:57.260
I don't know if I can.

19:57.362 --> 19:58.895
I have faith in you.

19:59.036 --> 20:00.936
This is super complicated stuff.

20:01.038 --> 20:03.305
It is. But think hard.

20:03.407 --> 20:05.641
You know the answers.

20:05.743 --> 20:07.943
I've got it!

20:08.045 --> 20:09.378
I have the solution!

20:19.657 --> 20:20.556
Ah!

20:29.934 --> 20:31.233
You did it!

20:32.670 --> 20:33.736
You missed my hand.

20:33.838 --> 20:35.471
No, I was doing the thing
from the movie.

20:35.573 --> 20:36.872
- What thing?
- The now classic

20:36.974 --> 20:39.141
Matt Damon-Stellan Skarsgard

20:39.243 --> 20:41.143
start-out-high-pass-each-other-

20:41.245 --> 20:44.079
continue-around-and-meet-down-
low-high-five.

20:44.181 --> 20:45.314
Oh, yeah. They did do that.

20:45.416 --> 20:47.249
- Of course they did.
- You wanna try it again?

20:47.351 --> 20:48.684
Mm, we kinda lost the moment.

20:48.786 --> 20:49.852
I'm not feeling it now.

20:49.954 --> 20:51.624
- You can do it.
- I don't think I can.

20:51.718 --> 20:52.945
I have faith in you.

20:53.047 --> 20:54.952
You're just repeating
what I said to you earlier.

20:55.045 --> 20:56.976
- I am.
- Let's do it!
