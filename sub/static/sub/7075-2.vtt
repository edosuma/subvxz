WEBVTT

00:04.016 --> 00:05.820
Why is everyone
wearing those hats?

00:05.821 --> 00:07.579
Is the dean planning
another ridiculous event,

00:07.580 --> 00:08.736
or is the Greendale hat club

00:08.737 --> 00:10.494
still struggling to be noteworthy?

00:10.495 --> 00:12.471
- You're talking about it.
- I talk about lots of stuff

00:12.472 --> 00:13.596
that annoys me.

00:13.693 --> 00:16.974
Speaking of the dean...
Guten tag, homies.

00:16.979 --> 00:19.533
I hope you'll all be
attending Oktoberfest.

00:19.534 --> 00:21.945
It's not often we get to
celebrate German culture.

00:21.946 --> 00:23.374
It's not often we want to.

00:23.375 --> 00:26.143
Yeah... a little
goes a long way.

00:26.144 --> 00:26.828
True.

00:26.829 --> 00:29.537
Greendale's Oktoberfest has
never drawn huge crowds,

00:29.538 --> 00:31.466
probably due to our diversity.

00:31.467 --> 00:35.075
So this year,
we are adding some color!

00:35.076 --> 00:36.252
Kick it!

00:36.340 --> 00:37.733
I'm gonna give this to you, Troy.

00:37.734 --> 00:39.873
"Pop and locktoberfest."

00:39.874 --> 00:43.769
The central event will
be a pop-and-lock-a-thon.

00:43.923 --> 00:45.640
Winner gets to annex Poland.

00:45.641 --> 00:46.415
Kidding!

00:46.416 --> 00:47.951
The winner gets an
iTunes gift card.

00:47.952 --> 00:50.635
Okay.
- Oh! A break-dance contest.

00:50.636 --> 00:52.068
What should we name our team?

00:52.069 --> 00:54.067
Okay. I'm gonna go
hang myself in my closet.

00:54.068 --> 00:55.033
I'm comin' with.

00:55.853 --> 00:56.928
Is it me, or is this campus

00:56.929 --> 00:58.897
getting more cartoonish every day?

00:58.898 --> 01:00.042
Yep. It's exciting.

01:00.043 --> 01:01.422
I painted a tunnel on
the side of the library.

01:01.423 --> 01:02.913
When it dries, I'm going for it.

01:07.099 --> 01:08.524
Okay. You see
that guy over there?

01:08.628 --> 01:09.619
The one wearing the Gucci suit

01:09.620 --> 01:11.696
and the lightweight
woven wool-mohair blend?

01:11.839 --> 01:13.325
We used to work together.

01:13.326 --> 01:15.634
Cool. So he's from your origins.

01:15.635 --> 01:16.987
This is all I need.

01:16.988 --> 01:19.406
Excuse me, sir.
You're all my friend needs.

01:21.207 --> 01:23.434
Your mouth isn't curved upwards.
Did I misread something?

01:24.806 --> 01:26.607
Ah...Tango?

01:26.608 --> 01:28.445
Sundance. We worked with

01:28.446 --> 01:29.886
different partners. - Got it.

01:29.887 --> 01:31.731
- Ha ha!
- Hey...

01:32.173 --> 01:33.505
What brings you to Greendale?

01:33.506 --> 01:34.623
I'm a teacher.

01:34.838 --> 01:36.796
Wait. That's worse than the truth.

01:36.797 --> 01:37.854
I'm a student.

01:37.855 --> 01:39.281
Hey, I'm in no
position to judge.

01:39.282 --> 01:40.612
I'm here for an
N.A. Meeting, so...

01:40.613 --> 01:42.562
- Narcotics anonymous?
- Remember when you asked

01:42.563 --> 01:45.187
for my secret, I said yoga?
I lied.

01:45.433 --> 01:46.429
I'm Abed. - Hey.

01:46.430 --> 01:47.978
Abed, this is Alan Connor.

01:47.979 --> 01:48.744
This guy and I

01:48.745 --> 01:51.394
used to wipe the courtroom
floor with prosecutors.

01:51.395 --> 01:52.827
D.A. called us the litterbugs,

01:52.828 --> 01:55.124
we put so much trash back
out on those streets.

01:55.855 --> 01:56.770
Come here, come here!

01:56.771 --> 01:59.152
You still ticklish? - Stop that!

01:59.153 --> 02:00.429
Hey, hey, hey.
Let's get a drink, huh?

02:00.430 --> 02:02.288
- Are you allowed?
- Yeah. I quit doing blow,

02:02.289 --> 02:03.404
not being rad.

02:03.405 --> 02:04.510
All right, let's do it.

02:04.511 --> 02:06.414
Wait. Jeff can't go.
He has class.

02:06.415 --> 02:09.044
Well, those cargo pants
would suggest otherwise.

02:09.616 --> 02:10.955
What has this place done to you?

02:10.955 --> 02:12.421
Ah. You have no idea.

02:12.422 --> 02:13.478
Hat club!

02:15.088 --> 02:16.549
Now you have some idea.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:55.353 --> 02:56.457
So...

02:56.841 --> 02:57.801
So?

02:59.466 --> 03:02.214
Anyone that's ever been in
a team pop-and-lock-a-thon

03:02.215 --> 03:04.592
knows you need at least seven
people to stand a chance.

03:04.593 --> 03:06.511
- We have seven.
- Oh, do you?

03:06.627 --> 03:08.557
Word has it on campus
that Winger's too busy

03:08.558 --> 03:10.775
hanging out with his
cool new lawyer friend.

03:10.776 --> 03:13.600
Ha. Slow news day.

03:15.640 --> 03:17.078
That's your Carson?

03:17.079 --> 03:18.229
Jon Stewart.

03:18.230 --> 03:20.626
- You depress me.
- Look, we'll get back to you.

03:20.627 --> 03:21.932
All right, well,
don't take too long.

03:21.933 --> 03:24.357
And don't rip off this exit.

03:26.862 --> 03:28.036
Shoom, shoom.

03:28.627 --> 03:31.596
- Where is Jeff?
- Obviously hanging with Alan.

03:31.597 --> 03:33.232
Those two are like siamese twins

03:33.233 --> 03:35.105
attached at the
cell phone holster.

03:35.106 --> 03:36.391
I haven't met him yet.

03:36.392 --> 03:38.784
Shouldn't we be happy that
Jeff found an old friend?

03:38.785 --> 03:39.993
Our concern is
that Alan is to Jeff

03:39.994 --> 03:41.261
what Rob Lowe was to James Spader

03:41.262 --> 03:42.946
in the 1990 film bad influence.

03:42.947 --> 03:44.376
He's a bad influence.

03:44.387 --> 03:45.318
You saw it?

03:45.319 --> 03:46.537
Hey, uh, guys.

03:46.538 --> 03:48.590
Uh, I'm gonna be a
little bit late today.

03:48.638 --> 03:50.435
Alan and I are gonna
take a quick sidebar.

03:50.436 --> 03:52.482
Mmm, or any bar.

03:53.527 --> 03:55.510
Oh, he's got Britta down!

03:56.712 --> 03:58.828
- You look familiar.
- That's possible.

03:58.829 --> 04:00.817
Have you or someone you
know been injured at work?

04:00.818 --> 04:01.754
Oh!

04:02.217 --> 04:04.607
Yes! A shrimp boat
ran over my cousin.

04:04.608 --> 04:05.897
That's serious. Call me.

04:05.898 --> 04:08.312
And, Jeff, you need to be
more respectful of our time.

04:08.313 --> 04:10.586
Shirley, if killed a man,

04:10.587 --> 04:12.463
as a Christian,
would you forgive me?

04:12.464 --> 04:13.235
I would.

04:13.236 --> 04:14.416
Then either that man's life

04:14.417 --> 04:15.799
is worth less than your time,

04:15.800 --> 04:18.007
or it's okay for me to be late.

04:18.007 --> 04:19.666
Ha ha! No!

04:19.666 --> 04:22.034
You still got the moves, man.

04:22.035 --> 04:24.364
If they gave away
awards for mind games,

04:24.365 --> 04:27.153
the statue'd be Jeff
Winger doing it to a brain.

04:27.154 --> 04:29.103
Come on, Jeff's bush league.

04:29.227 --> 04:30.930
I gave seminars on manipulation.

04:30.931 --> 04:32.817
I could reach into a man's soul

04:32.818 --> 04:35.047
and unravel it with one tug.

04:35.048 --> 04:36.287
Cool. Hit me.

04:37.896 --> 04:39.712
You're bald.
- So are you.

04:39.713 --> 04:40.822
I'll kill you, you...

04:40.823 --> 04:42.918
Come here! 
- Mistrial.

04:45.870 --> 04:47.952
Ha ha ha! Come on.

04:49.054 --> 04:50.052
I have hair.

04:53.831 --> 04:55.878
Father, I have hair.

04:56.829 --> 04:58.332
On a tax evasion case.

04:58.333 --> 04:58.989
Yeah.

04:58.990 --> 05:00.823
God, I miss talking
about this stuff!

05:00.824 --> 05:02.377
Well, you should
visit the office.

05:02.378 --> 05:04.493
Right. I can't
show my face there

05:04.494 --> 05:05.911
after getting busted like that.

05:05.912 --> 05:07.844
Jeff, you know what
lawyers call someone

05:07.845 --> 05:11.379
who defrauds the state bar,
cheats on his SATs,

05:11.380 --> 05:13.258
and cons his way into a firm?

05:13.348 --> 05:16.054
Best...Lawyer...Ever.

05:16.229 --> 05:17.291
Seriously?

05:17.292 --> 05:20.053
Hey, tomorrow night.
Office party.

05:20.054 --> 05:21.069
You're my guest.

05:21.070 --> 05:22.737
Oh. Naw.

05:22.770 --> 05:24.313
Come on, you just
said you missed it.

05:25.338 --> 05:26.231
I do.

05:26.681 --> 05:28.081
I really, really do.

05:32.488 --> 05:33.885
What does Alan
have that we don't?

05:33.886 --> 05:35.737
A butt for Jeff's Weiner.

05:36.780 --> 05:38.898
I mean, we all have butts too.

05:38.899 --> 05:41.437
We have butts.
Just not for the same thi...

05:41.438 --> 05:43.490
I'm trying to say they're gay.

05:43.491 --> 05:45.920
Well, I don't like how much
drinking and carousing they do.

05:45.921 --> 05:47.329
It's a gateway to narcotics.

05:47.330 --> 05:49.868
Narcotics! I know how I know Alan!

05:51.944 --> 05:53.618
But I'm not allowed to say.

05:53.619 --> 05:56.370
Which means that you met
him in narcotics anonymous.

05:56.995 --> 05:58.467
Why bring it up if
you're not allowed?

05:58.468 --> 06:01.592
Because...He said
something at a meeting

06:01.932 --> 06:03.175
about something bad he did. - Oh.

06:03.176 --> 06:04.377
And he might have
done it to Jeff,

06:04.378 --> 06:05.675
but I can't say what it is.

06:05.676 --> 06:08.008
Okay. You've gone from
precious to annoying.

06:08.096 --> 06:10.367
What if you don't say
it out loud but we guess?

06:10.368 --> 06:12.122
- Like charades?
- With this group?

06:12.123 --> 06:13.291
I'm watching.

06:20.744 --> 06:21.910
Four words.

06:22.854 --> 06:25.005
- "Alan got Jeff disbarred."
- Uh...

06:25.006 --> 06:27.172
Oh, please, those junkies
weren't thinking about rules

06:27.173 --> 06:28.472
when they were shooting up scag.

06:28.473 --> 06:30.989
- Jeff, Alan narced on you!
- Narced?

06:30.990 --> 06:34.190
Hmm. But he's like way
too primo for that,

06:34.191 --> 06:35.311
Frank Zappa.

06:35.312 --> 06:37.332
I think he turned you
in to the state bar.

06:37.333 --> 06:39.750
I was in an N.A.
meeting, and he bragged about it.

06:39.751 --> 06:41.832
He doesn't recognize me,
because my hair's longer,

06:41.833 --> 06:43.487
my skin's clearer, I...

06:43.491 --> 06:45.579
I've lost a lot of weight.
Annie.

06:46.302 --> 06:48.410
He said he turned me in?

06:48.411 --> 06:50.475
He said he sent an email

06:50.476 --> 06:52.527
that got a rival coworker fired.

06:52.528 --> 06:54.266
It was around the
time you got caught.

06:54.300 --> 06:56.533
I know they never covered
this on yo, gabba gabba,

06:56.534 --> 06:58.015
but that's called circumstantial.

06:58.016 --> 06:59.925
Any other meaningless
conspiracy theories?

06:59.926 --> 07:03.682
Yes. Did you know that
go-gurt is just yogurt?

07:04.356 --> 07:05.331
You know what a therapist

07:05.332 --> 07:07.233
calls this kind of a
relationship, right?

07:07.234 --> 07:08.215
A gold mine.

07:08.216 --> 07:09.604
Codependent.

07:09.868 --> 07:11.499
You guys don't want
me to be happy.

07:11.500 --> 07:13.909
You want me to need you.

07:13.935 --> 07:15.729
It's getting a little
claustrophobic.

07:15.730 --> 07:17.552
I used to run full-speed

07:17.553 --> 07:19.012
through the boundless wilderness,

07:19.013 --> 07:21.135
and now I'm in the zoo

07:21.339 --> 07:24.074
where the horizon is wallpaper
and the air is stale

07:24.075 --> 07:26.357
and nothing is ever at stake.

07:26.358 --> 07:29.056
In other words, we're not cool.

07:29.243 --> 07:30.954
I never said that.
You may have heard it.

07:30.955 --> 07:32.804
I may have thought it,
and it may be true.

07:32.805 --> 07:34.676
But I never said it.
Jeff, will we see you

07:34.677 --> 07:36.015
tomorrow night at the
pop-and-lock-a-thon?

07:36.016 --> 07:38.001
No, Abed,
I'm going to a cool party

07:38.002 --> 07:39.762
at my cool former law firm

07:39.763 --> 07:41.647
from when my life was cool.

07:44.353 --> 07:46.792
Fine. You can be on the team.

07:47.014 --> 07:48.019
New deal.

07:48.266 --> 07:51.253
If we win, I get to
be in the study group.

07:53.928 --> 07:55.488
The stakes have
never been higher.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.724
I just wanna thank
everybody for coming.

08:02.869 --> 08:04.432
You know, when I became a lawyer,

08:04.433 --> 08:05.556
I had a dream.

08:06.671 --> 08:08.805
I had a dream that one
day I'd be head of a firm

08:09.139 --> 08:10.710
so nobody would be able to talk

08:10.711 --> 08:12.515
about the big,
weird hole in my hand.

08:13.898 --> 08:15.746
I know everybody talks
about it behind my back,

08:15.747 --> 08:18.036
and that's okay.
You know, I would.

08:18.265 --> 08:20.878
What's great, though,
is that you don't stare

08:21.523 --> 08:22.974
or ask any questions.

08:23.205 --> 08:25.219
And as a reward for
your restraint,

08:25.978 --> 08:27.369
got a little something for ya.

08:29.056 --> 08:29.934
There.

08:29.967 --> 08:31.485
That oughta keep you
goin' to Christmas.

08:31.583 --> 08:32.977
Everybody have fun tonight!

08:36.357 --> 08:38.568
Anyone else with that
hand would wear a glove.

08:38.735 --> 08:40.643
He controls a room with it.

08:41.190 --> 08:42.294
He's the master.

08:42.296 --> 08:44.078
Well, he sure is a fan of yours.

08:45.935 --> 08:47.045
Oh, um...

08:47.175 --> 08:48.414
Hey, when you talk to him,

08:48.415 --> 08:49.701
will you mention me?

08:49.991 --> 08:52.027
He keeps passing me
over for partner.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.887
Alan, did you invite me
here with an ulterior motive?

08:56.546 --> 08:58.281
God, I miss this place!

09:01.995 --> 09:03.832
God, it's a sea of Wingers.

09:03.833 --> 09:06.646
This whole place reeks
of moral ambiguity.

09:06.647 --> 09:09.425
Actually, that was me.
I apologize.

09:09.426 --> 09:12.010
Now, you guys are
new to high society,

09:12.011 --> 09:14.435
so just... follow my lead,

09:14.583 --> 09:15.794
everything will be fine.

09:21.617 --> 09:23.067
First, why are you here?

09:23.068 --> 09:24.926
Second, I don't care. Leave.

09:24.927 --> 09:27.848
As a matter of fact,
Jeff, we were invited.

09:27.849 --> 09:29.183
Why would anyone do that?

09:29.184 --> 09:32.101
Hey, you guys made it!

09:32.102 --> 09:33.311
Come on in.

09:35.150 --> 09:37.098
Okay, before this
gets more embarrassing,

09:37.099 --> 09:38.588
what is your misguided plan?

09:38.589 --> 09:42.105
To apologize to you
for casting aspersions

09:42.106 --> 09:43.159
on your friend.

09:43.160 --> 09:44.602
And to show you we can be cool.

09:44.603 --> 09:46.944
Hey! Is that Jeff Winger?

09:47.902 --> 09:49.418
Find Annie and leave.

09:49.419 --> 09:51.056
Ted! Hey, man!

09:51.057 --> 09:52.488
- What's goin' on?
- Wow!

09:53.323 --> 09:55.029
Once Annie gets
Alan's office number,

09:55.030 --> 09:57.892
you guys break into his office,
hack into his emails,

09:57.893 --> 10:00.559
and find proof that
he screwed Jeff over.

10:02.474 --> 10:04.510
Fourth floor. 470.

10:04.654 --> 10:06.818
First he said it was 69.

10:06.901 --> 10:08.919
I wanna rub purell on my brain.

10:10.973 --> 10:12.504
You are so missed here, Jeff.

10:12.505 --> 10:14.515
If we had five guys around
here with your balls,

10:14.516 --> 10:15.898
we wouldn't need 30 lawyers.

10:15.899 --> 10:17.876
True. But we'd
need a good doctor.

10:18.879 --> 10:21.005
Ted, stop hittin' on my date.

10:21.006 --> 10:22.433
Ha ha ha ha ha!

10:22.434 --> 10:23.976
I'm kidding. We can share.

10:24.941 --> 10:26.308
I get the head!

10:26.402 --> 10:29.123
I love the brain in there! Arr,
arr, arr, arr!

10:29.124 --> 10:30.155
I'll eat it.

10:31.197 --> 10:33.016
Hey, everybody,
Jeff Winger's here!

10:33.017 --> 10:34.733
Hey!

10:35.140 --> 10:36.335
Shouldn't we notify someone

10:36.336 --> 10:38.994
that our team's not gonna make
it to the pop-and-lock-a-thon?

10:40.495 --> 10:42.720
You actually think
anybody cares?

10:43.222 --> 10:46.238
Um, checking in for the
Heather pop and locklears.

10:46.239 --> 10:49.685
Okay. And, um...
Where's the rest of your team?

10:49.686 --> 10:50.963
Oh, they'll be here.

10:50.964 --> 10:52.717
I suppose you're allowed
to start by yourself,

10:52.718 --> 10:54.482
but you won't stand a chance
if you don't have someone...

10:54.483 --> 10:55.935
they'll be here!

11:07.607 --> 11:09.504
I brought stuff
people use for capers.

11:11.135 --> 11:12.254
Suction cup.

11:13.247 --> 11:14.307
Credit card.

11:15.524 --> 11:16.617
Chloroform.

11:16.656 --> 11:18.753
The credit card doesn't work,
the chloroform does.

11:18.805 --> 11:21.124
Annie, go back and keep lookout.

11:21.148 --> 11:23.313
Why me lookout?
Why not you guys?

11:23.314 --> 11:24.429
'Cause if someone comes up here,

11:24.430 --> 11:26.406
Kanye and Kumar get taken to jail.

11:26.407 --> 11:29.145
You get taken to dinner.
You guys!

11:29.146 --> 11:30.903
I am the smartest one
in this whole group,

11:30.904 --> 11:33.485
and all I've been used for
is bait and distraction.

11:34.820 --> 11:35.781
Ohh!

11:35.877 --> 11:38.302
Go on your stupid mission.
I hope it sucks.

11:38.574 --> 11:40.326
- What did she say?
- I don't know.

11:40.327 --> 11:41.653
All I heard was suck.

11:42.628 --> 11:44.693
I'm surprised that Alan
hasn't made partner yet.

11:44.694 --> 11:46.403
I'm surprised I
haven't fired him.

11:46.453 --> 11:49.366
Why? I mean, he's got a
better win record than I do.

11:49.367 --> 11:52.106
He's a spineless
trust fund jagoff.

11:52.175 --> 11:53.462
I'll tell you what, Jeff.

11:53.673 --> 11:55.698
You're the best liar
I ever employed.

11:55.699 --> 11:57.442
If you can look me in the eye

11:57.443 --> 11:59.906
and tell me you
actually like Alan,

11:59.907 --> 12:01.560
I'll make him a full partner.

12:03.426 --> 12:06.190
Well, I only ever
really liked one person.

12:06.254 --> 12:07.252
My mom.

12:07.984 --> 12:09.423
And she liked my dad.

12:09.424 --> 12:12.741
And after all the dust
and custody was settled,

12:12.846 --> 12:16.021
the guy I really admired-
not liked, admired...

12:16.022 --> 12:17.656
was the lawyer leaving
the courthouse

12:17.657 --> 12:20.777
in the great-looking suit
and a sky blue Mercedes SLK.

12:20.778 --> 12:22.632
- Sweet ride.
- Sweet job.

12:22.633 --> 12:24.338
Sweet life. He didn't care.

12:24.339 --> 12:25.588
He couldn't care.

12:25.589 --> 12:27.973
And the less he cared,
the better he was.

12:27.974 --> 12:29.690
We are a special breed

12:29.691 --> 12:32.138
because we rise above
the sloppy stuff

12:32.139 --> 12:34.229
and look at the bottom line.

12:34.680 --> 12:37.503
You wanna like your employees?
Open a hair salon.

12:37.504 --> 12:40.270
You wanna win? Make Alan partner.

12:41.606 --> 12:44.051
The student has
become the master.

12:44.108 --> 12:45.376
Thank you, Jeff.

12:45.608 --> 12:47.492
You make me wanna be a worse man.

12:50.111 --> 12:51.654
By the way, just 'cause
you can't work cases here

12:51.655 --> 12:52.973
doesn't mean you can't work.

12:52.974 --> 12:54.512
You can always be a consultant.

12:54.513 --> 12:56.921
Ted...That would be amazing.

12:58.722 --> 13:00.213
Oh. I'll be right back.

13:00.257 --> 13:01.466
I didn't know they had rules.

13:02.642 --> 13:05.064
Hey, Jeff.
I'm sure you know Phillip.

13:05.065 --> 13:08.073
Did you know that if I sleep
with Philip once a month,

13:08.074 --> 13:11.704
I can use his beach house
in Rio whenever I want?

13:11.705 --> 13:12.510
Wow.

13:12.511 --> 13:14.070
You guys are really
on to something.

13:14.071 --> 13:16.311
I think you found the
world's newest profession.

13:16.312 --> 13:18.800
Guys, guys, did you know I
actually have a civil case

13:18.801 --> 13:20.979
against that bitch
that stole my husband?

13:20.980 --> 13:22.618
Shirley, don't sue a stripper.

13:22.619 --> 13:24.150
- Why not?
- She's a stripper.

13:24.151 --> 13:27.270
Life sued her, and she lost.
Where's Pierce?

13:27.299 --> 13:29.032
Jeez, why am I even
worried about him?

13:29.033 --> 13:30.018
Hey.

13:30.425 --> 13:32.042
Did you know there's
an island in Indonesia

13:32.043 --> 13:33.688
where you can hunt people?

13:34.486 --> 13:35.691
We need to talk.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.258
I think this is it.
Abed: Print it.

13:42.154 --> 13:43.125
'Scuse me.

13:43.242 --> 13:45.383
Who are you guys?
This is not your office.

13:45.875 --> 13:47.154
I can explain.

13:50.076 --> 13:52.082
Let me explain.

14:07.766 --> 14:08.979
Oh, my God!

14:10.109 --> 14:12.611
- I didn't know what to do.
- Oh, my God!

14:13.480 --> 14:14.746
I usually have one
foot out of reality,

14:14.747 --> 14:16.166
and even I'm freaking
out right now.

14:16.269 --> 14:17.691
You chloroformed the janitor?

14:17.692 --> 14:19.518
Stop yelling at me!
You're the ones that got caught!

14:19.519 --> 14:20.662
You're the one who's yelling!

14:20.663 --> 14:22.519
We're in big trouble!
We have to do something!

14:22.520 --> 14:25.353
Oh, I don't know what to do.
My whole brain is crying!

14:25.354 --> 14:26.576
Oh! Oh oh oh!

14:26.577 --> 14:28.651
Guys, guys, guys!

14:28.652 --> 14:29.947
Hey, hey, I have an idea.

14:30.284 --> 14:32.082
Okay, it may sound a
little weird, but trust me.

14:43.912 --> 14:45.315
What's...Happening?

14:45.316 --> 14:49.410
Oh! We all got chloroformed!

14:49.411 --> 14:52.436
Somebody chloroformed all of us.

14:52.437 --> 14:54.247
And now we're
regaining consciousness

14:54.248 --> 14:55.264
together.

14:55.887 --> 14:59.062
I don't understand. Who's she?

14:59.936 --> 15:02.457
Why is she holding a rag?

15:17.463 --> 15:18.453
Okay, that was the
worst idea ever.

15:18.454 --> 15:19.547
Can we please just run away now?

15:19.548 --> 15:20.394
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:23.167 --> 15:25.350
It is the fourth straight hour,

15:25.351 --> 15:28.298
and Ben Chang is still on his own.

15:28.675 --> 15:32.157
One can only imagine
what is driving him to...

15:32.158 --> 15:34.601
Push himself to such limits!

15:47.998 --> 15:49.019
My body hurts.

15:50.636 --> 15:51.635
My body hurts.

15:52.965 --> 15:54.315
You jealous because
we're fitting in

15:54.316 --> 15:55.697
with your cool friends?

15:55.698 --> 15:58.213
No. I'm distracted,
watching you mutate.

15:58.214 --> 15:59.659
Britta, you're not a whore.

15:59.660 --> 16:01.486
Shirley, Jesus turned
the other cheek.

16:01.487 --> 16:02.827
He didn't garnish wages.

16:02.828 --> 16:04.770
Pierce, do I even
need to say this?

16:04.771 --> 16:06.968
It is bad to hunt man for sport.

16:06.969 --> 16:08.322
Bad ass.

16:09.262 --> 16:12.166
This is the email that Alan
sent the bar association.

16:14.667 --> 16:16.389
He stabbed you in the back, Jeff.

16:16.481 --> 16:17.928
He's a bad friend.

16:20.702 --> 16:21.658
You're right.

16:22.740 --> 16:24.214
He is a bad friend.

16:27.523 --> 16:29.172
But he is a good lawyer.

16:30.477 --> 16:31.428
Now, I appreciate

16:31.429 --> 16:32.781
you guys caring,

16:32.782 --> 16:35.646
but you have to
understand that I don't.

16:35.730 --> 16:37.369
Caring is lethal around here.

16:37.370 --> 16:38.849
It's... it's a disease.

16:38.850 --> 16:40.915
You guys have it. I don't.

16:40.916 --> 16:43.560
So if you do care about me,

16:43.632 --> 16:44.965
don't infect me.

16:46.143 --> 16:46.842
Now,

16:46.843 --> 16:48.865
go win that pop-and-lock-a-thon.

16:49.436 --> 16:50.636
I'll see you Monday.

16:52.545 --> 16:55.113
It's like watching a soul
slip through our fingers.

16:55.190 --> 16:57.046
But what more can we do?

16:59.001 --> 17:00.459
Would you stop?

17:02.916 --> 17:04.587
Tango!

17:04.960 --> 17:06.631
I don't know how
you did it, man...

17:06.858 --> 17:08.753
But you're looking at
the firm's next partner.

17:08.813 --> 17:11.529
If I wasn't actively
repressing my bi-curiosity,

17:11.530 --> 17:13.688
I would kiss you full
on your beautiful mouth.

17:13.861 --> 17:15.811
Well, maybe you can
return the favor one day.

17:15.813 --> 17:18.315
Maybe...I can
return it right now.

17:19.471 --> 17:20.249
You probably know

17:20.250 --> 17:23.453
that it was someone here at
the firm who turned you in.

17:25.213 --> 17:26.805
God, this is really hard.

17:28.273 --> 17:30.490
Alan... it's okay.

17:30.491 --> 17:31.655
You can tell me.

17:37.370 --> 17:38.590
It was Thompson.

17:39.751 --> 17:41.282
- Thompson.
- Yeah.

17:42.691 --> 17:45.278
Thompson that adopted
three at-risk teens

17:45.279 --> 17:47.854
and donated his kidney to a temp.

17:48.720 --> 17:50.381
- All an act.
- Mm.

17:50.382 --> 17:52.780
Yeah. Why do you think he
quit right after you left?

17:53.439 --> 17:54.830
Well, his... his wife died.

17:55.085 --> 17:56.640
Did she...Jeff?

17:57.246 --> 18:00.314
Did...She?

18:00.449 --> 18:02.785
Anyway...Congrats.

18:03.532 --> 18:05.751
Hey, let's go do some
shots with Phil, huh?

18:05.752 --> 18:07.586
No, you go ahead. I, uh...

18:08.029 --> 18:09.419
I think I caught something...

18:09.658 --> 18:11.205
At... at Greendale.

18:11.206 --> 18:13.787
College chicks. I get ya!

18:15.802 --> 18:16.662
You're bad!

18:29.399 --> 18:30.244
It hurts!

18:30.245 --> 18:32.108
Shamone...It hurts!

18:32.109 --> 18:34.115
Ben, you need to
switch up your moves.

18:35.594 --> 18:36.242
Ohh...

18:36.243 --> 18:37.772
***

18:37.773 --> 18:40.173
***

18:40.174 --> 18:41.493
- oh!
- Oh, my God!

18:41.494 --> 18:43.513
Only two teams left.

18:43.514 --> 18:45.198
The poppy lockstockings,

18:45.199 --> 18:47.741
and the Heather pop and locklears!

18:49.317 --> 18:51.378
- Troy, what's wrong?
- I don't know.

18:51.379 --> 18:52.903
My heart's just not in it.

18:52.904 --> 18:53.689
Maybe we should quit.

18:53.690 --> 18:56.337
I mean, who even cares
about this anyway?

18:56.771 --> 18:59.075
***

18:59.076 --> 19:00.659
- oh, Jeffrey, you're back!
- Oh!

19:01.493 --> 19:03.494
- Did you miss me?
- Took you long enough.

19:04.614 --> 19:05.619
Oh!

19:06.741 --> 19:07.992
Now we got it.

19:08.297 --> 19:09.727
Hey! - Yes!

19:12.717 --> 19:15.088
Jeffrey, did you punch
Alan in his rotten face

19:15.089 --> 19:16.794
and then storm out? - Hell, no.

19:16.795 --> 19:18.124
That guy's useful to me.

19:18.125 --> 19:19.886
Thanks to you,
I've now got leverage

19:19.887 --> 19:22.372
over a spineless jag
that just made partner.

19:22.653 --> 19:24.508
That is the place I want to work.

19:24.597 --> 19:26.489
But I prefer to hang
out with cool people,

19:26.490 --> 19:29.148
people so cool... they care.

19:29.341 --> 19:30.246
Oh!

19:30.639 --> 19:32.603
And now...The puppet.

19:40.616 --> 19:41.710
Jeffrey!

19:44.068 --> 19:46.896
Ah, no parking on the
dance floor, Winger.

19:47.543 --> 19:49.080
No, I'm serious.
You're disqualified.

19:49.081 --> 19:51.655
The winners are the
poppy lockstockings!

19:53.971 --> 19:56.220
Noooooo!

19:56.673 --> 19:58.126
I been popping and locking

19:58.127 --> 20:00.197
for five hours,

20:00.198 --> 20:02.224
and you threw it all away!

20:02.693 --> 20:04.482
The contest doesn't matter.

20:04.576 --> 20:06.638
What's important is
we have each other.

20:07.019 --> 20:09.685
Then...Can I be
in your study group?

20:09.804 --> 20:11.756
Well, that wasn't the deal.

20:12.130 --> 20:14.053
We lost, so...

20:14.463 --> 20:15.939
That was dope, what we did.

20:15.940 --> 20:17.294
That was so good!

20:17.295 --> 20:20.358
The puppet too!
The puppet was so...

20:20.814 --> 20:22.306
I rolled my ankle during that.

20:22.307 --> 20:23.564
- Aw!
- Twisted it?

20:23.565 --> 20:24.891
It was worth it, though.

20:32.055 --> 20:33.412
You know what,
he's bringing us down.

20:33.413 --> 20:35.544
Let's move him. Can we move him?

20:37.637 --> 20:39.061
Psst! Troy!

20:39.462 --> 20:40.355
It's me.

20:40.929 --> 20:41.876
Abed?

20:41.906 --> 20:43.073
I made it through!

20:43.074 --> 20:44.524
I'm a cartoon now.

20:44.662 --> 20:45.837
That's impossible.

20:45.838 --> 20:48.534
Nothing's impossible in here.
Animals can talk.

20:48.535 --> 20:50.116
Your heart is shaped like a heart.

20:50.117 --> 20:52.472
And the smell of pie
can make you float.

20:52.473 --> 20:54.587
You have to believe, Troy.

20:56.374 --> 20:57.645
Wait! You don't have to believe.

20:57.646 --> 20:58.626
I didn't.

21:00.814 --> 21:01.849
I didn't.

21:05.136 --> 21:06.688
I may have done
some damage there.

21:06.888 --> 21:17.088
