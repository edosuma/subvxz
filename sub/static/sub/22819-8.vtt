WEBVTT

01:02.397 --> 01:07.026
It's time!
How I've been impatient.

01:07.110 --> 01:11.906
Now, I can finally fulfill
my promise to the gods,
and kill Lagertha.

01:18.371 --> 01:20.915
I'm ready to avenge
our mother.

01:20.999 --> 01:22.625
Not because she was
a good mother to me,

01:22.709 --> 01:24.461
but because
Lagertha deserves it.

01:26.129 --> 01:27.881
That's good enough
to me.

01:29.632 --> 01:31.676
But are you ready
to deal with Ubbe?

01:33.678 --> 01:34.888
Will you kill him
if you have to,

01:34.971 --> 01:38.475
even if he is your
own flesh and blood?

01:38.600 --> 01:41.436
If I kill Ubbe,
won't my fame be assured?

01:46.816 --> 01:49.486
That's the way to talk!

01:50.403 --> 01:54.073
My love. What are you doing?

01:54.240 --> 01:57.327
I'm coming with you.
Not when you're
carrying my child.

01:57.619 --> 01:59.204
Even if I am
carrying your child,

01:59.287 --> 02:01.873
I am still coming
with you.

02:01.998 --> 02:04.083
I have already
made up my mind.

02:07.170 --> 02:11.674
I should have known
that the woman the gods
chose for my wife

02:11.758 --> 02:15.136
would be very brave
and courageous.

02:15.261 --> 02:18.264
Your wish is my command.

02:18.389 --> 02:21.392
You will sail with us,
my love.

02:27.607 --> 02:29.317
Finish loading!

02:30.276 --> 02:31.528
Your Grace!

02:35.073 --> 02:36.282
Don't call me that.

02:36.658 --> 02:40.787
You think it's a joke,
but you have no
understanding of "grace."

02:42.622 --> 02:43.790
Wait.

02:46.292 --> 02:48.419
I have something for you.

02:55.218 --> 03:00.098
This sword only works
its magic for its owner.

03:00.515 --> 03:03.184
So, have it. Take it.
It's yours.

03:04.811 --> 03:08.439
- Oars ready!
- Ready the sails!

03:14.571 --> 03:16.614
Ready to hoist sails!

03:43.474 --> 03:44.726
It is a proud day,

03:45.852 --> 03:49.897
when a father takes his son
to his first battle.

04:14.339 --> 04:16.591
I will come home to you soon.

04:27.769 --> 04:28.853
Prepare the horses!

04:40.406 --> 04:44.202
Are you ready, my friend?
Of course.

04:44.327 --> 04:46.079
You may have to fight
against your brother.

04:46.162 --> 04:50.249
It's the same for you.
Some trees have to fall
in the forest.

05:19.195 --> 05:22.657
- It's level!
- Yeah, that's good.

05:22.740 --> 05:27.078
I have it! Almost done!

05:27.203 --> 05:29.163
Add some more!

05:38.548 --> 05:41.759
We have food to eat,
water to drink.

05:42.135 --> 05:45.471
We all have reason to be
satisfied with what we have
achieved so far.

05:45.805 --> 05:48.474
But what we also
need to build
is a temple.

05:48.725 --> 05:51.185
A temple to the gods,
who have been so good to us.

05:51.602 --> 05:56.232
And I suggest that Thor,
the god of the farmers,
like us,

05:56.315 --> 05:58.568
shall be the main god
of the temple.

05:58.693 --> 06:02.029
And on the altar,
we shall make a fire,
which must never go out.

06:02.780 --> 06:05.283
The building of the temple
and its upkeep

06:05.575 --> 06:08.494
shall be paid by all of us
in the form of a tax.

06:08.578 --> 06:10.705
I trust this will be
acceptable to everyone.

06:10.788 --> 06:12.623
Why should we
build a temple

06:12.707 --> 06:15.626
when we haven't even
had enough time to build
our own houses?

06:16.043 --> 06:17.920
We give credit
where credit is due.

06:18.629 --> 06:23.217
Not to ourselves
for this opportunity,
but to the gods.

06:23.718 --> 06:27.263
You can build it on my land,
and I will have a care for it.

06:27.472 --> 06:30.558
It does not surprise me,
Flatnose,

06:30.683 --> 06:32.894
to hear you
put yourself forward for this.

06:34.645 --> 06:38.107
Anyone would think
you were trying
to ingratiate yourself,

06:38.399 --> 06:40.860
not with the gods,

06:40.985 --> 06:42.904
but with Floki here!

06:43.237 --> 06:46.282
I don't think my father
is doing anything more
than offering

06:46.365 --> 06:48.159
his services
to our community.

06:48.284 --> 06:49.827
No.

06:49.911 --> 06:52.205
He's trying
to lick Floki's ass.

06:53.414 --> 06:55.374
Anyone can see it.

06:55.500 --> 06:58.794
As if Floki deserves
to have his ass licked.

06:59.128 --> 07:02.340
He fooled all of us
into coming here.

07:02.924 --> 07:06.552
There will be
no crop this year.

07:06.677 --> 07:09.222
So, when we have
eaten our animals,

07:09.555 --> 07:12.600
there will be nothing left
to eat for the winter.

07:12.934 --> 07:15.811
Many of us
will starve to death.

07:16.062 --> 07:19.065
Why should we build a temple
before our own houses?

07:19.148 --> 07:23.402
Floki told us it would
be hard at first.
He didn't lie to us.

07:23.486 --> 07:26.030
He completely lied to us.

07:26.155 --> 07:28.533
He only told the truth
when it was too late.

07:28.908 --> 07:30.451
Bul, you are
your father's son.

07:30.535 --> 07:32.411
Of course,
you should listen to him.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.289
But not if he's wrong.

07:36.582 --> 07:38.709
I know we can make
this settlement work.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.754
Most of us here
are committed
to its success.

07:41.879 --> 07:44.298
- We came here to die.
- No!

07:44.549 --> 07:46.592
No, we will not die!

07:46.717 --> 07:49.720
We will turn this land
into somewhere wonderful
to live!

07:50.012 --> 07:53.849
And we should praise the gods!
Floki is right about that.

07:54.058 --> 07:55.851
Why do we have to argue?

07:57.436 --> 07:58.771
My wife, Thorunn,
is with child.

07:58.854 --> 08:01.357
I want the child to be born
with hope for the future.

08:01.566 --> 08:04.068
That is my grandchild,

08:05.319 --> 08:07.238
and I can see
no hope for it.

08:09.031 --> 08:11.492
If you don't like it
here, Eyvind,

08:12.577 --> 08:14.245
you can always try
and sail back.

08:14.370 --> 08:17.206
No, Floki.

08:17.290 --> 08:21.168
That is precisely
what we cannot do.

08:21.294 --> 08:24.171
By following you here,

08:26.132 --> 08:28.634
we have abandoned our homes,

08:28.801 --> 08:31.762
our town, our Queen.

08:32.430 --> 08:36.225
None of us can ever,
ever go back.

08:36.559 --> 08:39.478
Then we must
make the best of it.

08:39.562 --> 08:43.024
We must tolerate
and love one another.

08:43.107 --> 08:44.442
We must put
the settlement first,

08:44.525 --> 08:46.861
and ourselves only afterwards.

08:47.069 --> 08:49.071
You have
to agree, Eyvind.

08:51.490 --> 08:53.075
You have to.

09:32.156 --> 09:34.033
This is not right.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.663
It is not right that
the sons of Ragnar

09:38.746 --> 09:41.248
should try and slaughter
each other.

09:45.586 --> 09:47.505
We will send emissaries.

09:48.506 --> 09:49.840
I agree.

10:37.722 --> 10:41.058
If we must fight,
then we must fight.

10:41.142 --> 10:45.062
But first, let us discuss the
alternatives, in good faith.

10:45.187 --> 10:47.314
We are willing to do that.

10:47.398 --> 10:51.110
But first,
we must exchange hostages.

10:51.902 --> 10:54.321
Good faith,
although commendable,

10:55.322 --> 10:56.907
it's not really enough.

10:58.409 --> 11:01.704
Your brother will go
with you to your camp.

11:02.079 --> 11:03.831
And your brother
will go to yours.

11:12.381 --> 11:14.467
We meet again
tomorrow, yes?

11:15.259 --> 11:16.927
Yes.

11:31.650 --> 11:32.818
How is Ivar?

11:33.277 --> 11:35.279
He is Ivar.

11:35.362 --> 11:38.449
It's a pity you jumped ship.

11:38.532 --> 11:40.910
I will never understand.
No.

11:41.660 --> 11:42.953
You wouldn't.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.581
No doubt you
regret it now, though.

11:45.748 --> 11:48.292
No. What's the point
of regret?

11:52.630 --> 11:55.716
I saw a figure
amongst your leaders.

11:56.342 --> 11:59.136
The Saxon we met
in Aethelwulf's camp,
Bishop Heahmund.

11:59.220 --> 12:01.722
Why is he here?

12:01.847 --> 12:03.599
Ivar captured
him in battle.

12:03.808 --> 12:06.435
He is a great,
great warrior.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.270
You would do well
to stay out of his way.

12:08.354 --> 12:11.190
He would do well
to stay out of my way.

12:15.861 --> 12:20.616
We want to find a way
of avoiding needless
slaughter.

12:20.699 --> 12:22.201
Please help us, Hvitserk.

12:32.211 --> 12:34.755
This is madness.

12:34.839 --> 12:35.965
Is it?

12:36.799 --> 12:39.927
You are here,
where you belong.
Don't deny it.

12:40.678 --> 12:44.056
Why would you fight
for Lagertha, or Bjorn?

12:44.139 --> 12:45.349
They are not your folk.

12:46.892 --> 12:51.522
Bjorn saved my life.
Isn't that reason enough?

12:51.939 --> 12:54.900
Not really.

12:54.984 --> 12:59.405
We all choose to live
a dangerous life,
that is part of our way.

13:01.073 --> 13:02.366
So, I think that you give

13:02.449 --> 13:05.536
what happened between
you and Bjorn too much
importance.

13:06.579 --> 13:10.040
Family has a greater claim.

13:10.124 --> 13:12.126
I don't want to
fight against you.

13:12.251 --> 13:16.171
I don't want to
have to kill you.

13:16.297 --> 13:18.632
The world would
make no sense.

13:23.178 --> 13:27.016
I suppose none of this makes
any sense to him, anyway.

13:27.099 --> 13:30.144
He's a great warrior.
He doesn't need anything
to make sense.

13:30.895 --> 13:34.690
By the gods, Ivar,
you are just so cynical.

13:36.650 --> 13:39.403
You just don't care,
do you?

13:40.029 --> 13:41.822
I care

13:41.906 --> 13:44.992
about winning this war.

13:45.075 --> 13:49.663
Halfdan, you have
to choose between
a friend or a brother.

13:51.790 --> 13:54.585
To me, the answer is obvious.

14:42.424 --> 14:43.801
Ivar is in the wrong.

14:46.387 --> 14:48.347
Why are you supporting him?
Because I...

14:48.430 --> 14:50.724
Do not tell me it's because
you and him are brothers.

14:50.808 --> 14:52.810
You and I
are brothers, too.

14:54.269 --> 14:57.731
Do not risk
your life for Ivar's.

14:57.815 --> 15:01.860
Haven't the gods already
decided who I shall
sacrifice my life for?

15:01.944 --> 15:05.614
The gods may be just
waiting for your decision.

15:06.657 --> 15:09.410
I do not want to meet you
face-to-face in battle.

15:11.495 --> 15:13.580
I do not want to
have to kill you.

15:14.039 --> 15:16.542
Stay.
You're my little brother.

15:18.293 --> 15:19.962
Stay.

15:23.590 --> 15:27.177
You are a part of my fate.
As I am a part of yours.

15:29.847 --> 15:31.098
Stay.

15:33.976 --> 15:37.020
<i>Sleep, sleep, my son</i>

15:37.229 --> 15:40.232
<i>The seal's asleep in the sea</i>

15:40.649 --> 15:44.862
<i>The swan on the breaker</i>

15:44.945 --> 15:48.490
<i>Seagull on the hill</i>

15:48.574 --> 15:55.122
<i>The cod in the deep water</i>

15:56.290 --> 15:57.458
<i>Sleep</i>

15:58.667 --> 16:00.169
<i>Sleep</i>

16:01.754 --> 16:06.300
<i>I love you</i>

16:20.272 --> 16:24.401
We all know today
we have so many shield-maidens
and warriors-at-arms,

16:25.068 --> 16:27.070
that we must decide
whether we fight,

16:27.738 --> 16:29.239
or we reach
an accommodation,

16:29.323 --> 16:33.243
allowing us to go
live our lives with
integrity and honor.

16:33.494 --> 16:35.370
I call upon my brothers,

16:35.454 --> 16:36.455
Ivar,

16:38.665 --> 16:39.917
Hvitserk.

16:40.876 --> 16:42.961
Let's put aside
our differences,

16:43.045 --> 16:45.839
for the sake of our father.

16:45.923 --> 16:48.258
A civil war
can only bring tragedy,

16:48.801 --> 16:50.511
weaken our family,

16:50.594 --> 16:52.888
and set in train a lifetime
of revenge obligations

16:52.971 --> 16:57.017
for those who manage
to survive! Is that really
what you all want?

16:59.102 --> 17:01.230
I want to speak up
and support Bjorn

17:01.355 --> 17:04.775
and his call for
a peaceful resolution.

17:04.858 --> 17:07.361
It is true I set my face
against my brother.

17:08.946 --> 17:12.157
But if you can
forgive me, Ivar,

17:12.241 --> 17:13.367
let us make an accord.

17:14.493 --> 17:18.288
We are going to war
for the Kingdom of Kattegat.

17:18.413 --> 17:22.960
The Kingdom of Kattegat
was carved out by my husband,
Ragnar Lothbrok,

17:23.794 --> 17:26.296
and then by me.

17:26.380 --> 17:29.341
I am its rightful Queen.

17:32.594 --> 17:37.808
What we should be
discussing is how we
combine our great armies

17:37.891 --> 17:41.061
and direct them out
towards new lands,

17:41.144 --> 17:44.398
new conquests,
new opportunities.

17:45.107 --> 17:48.610
What a terrible pity
to kill our young men

17:48.694 --> 17:52.739
for a piece of land,
which is already ours.

18:00.122 --> 18:01.331
Astrid!

18:03.750 --> 18:05.669
I am happy to see you again.

18:06.587 --> 18:08.338
Whatever has happened, I...

18:09.298 --> 18:11.174
I don't want to fight you.

18:15.304 --> 18:16.513
Astrid!

18:18.724 --> 18:21.184
I am married now.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.854
I am King Harald's wife.

18:35.866 --> 18:38.785
Queen Astrid, I suppose!

18:39.912 --> 18:43.373
Brother, let's not fight.

18:43.498 --> 18:45.751
What can we gain?

18:45.876 --> 18:46.877
Nothing.

18:47.085 --> 18:50.047
On the contrary,

18:50.130 --> 18:51.465
we will gain the world.

18:53.091 --> 18:56.345
Join us, and I will
share it with you.

18:58.263 --> 19:00.307
It is really
up to you, Ivar.

19:01.767 --> 19:04.436
If you decide that you cannot
fight against your brothers,

19:04.519 --> 19:06.939
that you do not want to fight
against your brothers,

19:07.773 --> 19:09.983
then we can find an accord.

19:10.275 --> 19:12.653
And King Harald can't stop us.

19:19.034 --> 19:22.037
You have so much
to lose, Ivar.

19:26.583 --> 19:28.210
If you want war,

19:30.712 --> 19:32.381
then let's have war.

19:32.464 --> 19:35.592
But win or lose,

19:36.301 --> 19:37.844
you lose.

19:39.680 --> 19:42.933
You gain victory
over the other sons of Ragnar,

19:43.642 --> 19:49.815
and people will say
that you are an illegitimate
ruler and a usurper.

19:50.732 --> 19:53.068
And if you lose,

19:53.151 --> 19:56.989
they will say it was
by the will of the gods,

19:57.406 --> 19:59.616
and the will of Ragnar,

19:59.700 --> 20:04.204
who now sups with them
in Valhalla and cries
for us now.

20:06.540 --> 20:08.125
Do not do this, Ivar.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.794
We are the sons of Ragnar.

20:11.461 --> 20:13.714
Is that not enough
for any man?

20:38.113 --> 20:39.656
Bring horns of mead.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.700
We should celebrate.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.746
There will be no battle
today, nor tomorrow.

20:46.163 --> 20:48.331
What are you talking about?

20:48.457 --> 20:50.417
You cannot decide this!

20:50.500 --> 20:52.502
I do not want to fight
against my brothers.

20:52.586 --> 20:55.338
I still hate myself
for killing Sigurd.

20:57.299 --> 21:00.886
This would be
10 times worse.

21:00.969 --> 21:02.679
I... I can't.

21:08.560 --> 21:11.313
I renounce my promise
to kill Lagertha.

21:12.064 --> 21:14.274
She can have Kattegat.
I don't want it.

21:26.620 --> 21:29.331
Ubbe, you're right.

21:29.414 --> 21:31.792
We are all sons of Ragnar.

21:35.295 --> 21:36.379
Forgive me.

21:48.517 --> 21:49.559
Skol!

21:51.228 --> 21:52.395
Skol!
Skol!

22:12.916 --> 22:14.918
How blue are my eyes, huh?

22:15.001 --> 22:17.003
What?
How blue
are my eyes?

22:18.004 --> 22:19.381
Your eyes are very blue.
Hmm.

22:19.464 --> 22:21.842
You remember
I had to ask you
every single morning

22:21.925 --> 22:23.385
how blue the whites
of my eyes were?

22:23.468 --> 22:24.594
Because if they were
very blue,

22:24.678 --> 22:26.221
I was in great danger
of breaking a bone.

22:26.346 --> 22:28.515
Yes. I remember,
it was a big part
of my childhood,

22:28.598 --> 22:30.517
"How blue are
Ivar's eyes today?"

22:30.642 --> 22:35.272
I might break a bone,
but I can never break
a promise.

22:35.397 --> 22:38.608
I can never forgive Lagertha
for murdering our mother.

22:38.692 --> 22:40.902
How can you? Hmm?
How can you?

22:41.361 --> 22:42.529
Hmm?

22:42.612 --> 22:44.823
Our mother!

22:45.031 --> 22:46.825
Of course,
I'm going to kill her!

22:49.369 --> 22:50.662
You can try.

22:50.829 --> 22:52.080
Oh, I will.

22:56.126 --> 22:57.669
You said you wouldn't
fight your brothers.

22:57.752 --> 23:00.630
You are no longer my brother.

23:07.721 --> 23:10.974
You were once my legs,

23:11.057 --> 23:12.601
but not anymore.

23:23.195 --> 23:24.362
This was all a waste of time.

23:24.446 --> 23:28.950
No. Not at all.
You can surrender
Kattegat now.

23:29.117 --> 23:32.996
You've all been talking
about how terrible
the slaughter will be.

23:33.079 --> 23:38.168
How we will kill our
nearest relations and members
of our family.

23:38.251 --> 23:40.921
I don't want to do that.
Let us not do it.

23:41.296 --> 23:44.132
You, Bjorn,

23:44.216 --> 23:46.176
Lagertha,

23:46.676 --> 23:48.220
just go away,
leave this place.

23:49.012 --> 23:51.014
Do not put your men
to the test.

24:08.531 --> 24:09.950
Not now.

24:47.904 --> 24:51.116
You're sure?

24:51.199 --> 24:54.077
Are you going to deny
your brother?

24:55.870 --> 25:00.041
Bjorn saved my life.
I'm indebted.

25:01.626 --> 25:03.878
You're not his blood.

25:07.924 --> 25:12.012
Maybe
we care too much for that.

25:12.971 --> 25:14.014
Maybe.

25:16.975 --> 25:17.976
Maybe.

25:31.031 --> 25:32.365
I'm sorry, brother.

25:35.368 --> 25:36.786
Truly.

25:40.540 --> 25:42.000
Don't be sorry.

25:42.876 --> 25:44.753
No.

25:50.425 --> 25:52.302
Halt!
Hold!

25:57.015 --> 25:58.475
You know I'll kill you.

25:58.933 --> 26:01.269
You understand that?

26:01.519 --> 26:03.730
I will kill you.

26:37.305 --> 26:38.598
Careful, My Lord!

26:46.272 --> 26:47.482
Go!

27:07.043 --> 27:08.086
One more!

27:10.421 --> 27:15.844
Tell me, what was your
impression of the community
at Lindisfarne?

27:15.969 --> 27:18.930
I was not impressed
by their teaching.

27:19.013 --> 27:22.183
I told the Abbot that
they should do more in English
rather than Latin,

27:22.267 --> 27:24.477
and educate
the ordinary people
outside the monastery.

27:25.520 --> 27:28.022
And how did the Abbot respond?

27:28.106 --> 27:31.985
He is too set in his ways,
like most of them.

27:32.068 --> 27:34.362
Nor did he like it
when I told him he was
fooling himself

27:34.445 --> 27:38.658
by believing that God
would save them from
another Viking attack.

27:38.741 --> 27:40.994
Well, what should they do?

27:41.619 --> 27:43.705
Arm all the monks?

27:43.997 --> 27:45.081
No.

27:46.541 --> 27:49.752
It's what grandfather said,

27:49.836 --> 27:51.296
we have to build ships.

27:51.379 --> 27:55.967
We have to build a navy
to prevent these incursions
and attacks.

27:56.050 --> 27:58.011
Once they're here,
it's too late.

27:59.971 --> 28:05.101
You should talk
to your father
about that.

28:05.185 --> 28:07.604
He won't listen.
Of course, he will listen.

28:07.854 --> 28:09.063
No.

28:09.147 --> 28:12.317
Look! He's too busy
training my brother
to be a great warrior.

28:12.483 --> 28:14.068
My son!

28:14.152 --> 28:17.363
Aethelred!

28:18.114 --> 28:20.491
In some ways, he's just like
the Abbot at Lindisfarne,

28:20.575 --> 28:23.453
too set in his ways,
too old-fashioned.

28:25.038 --> 28:27.540
Your father carries
a very heavy burden.

28:27.624 --> 28:30.835
But he is not my father.

28:30.919 --> 28:32.879
My father is dead.

28:33.004 --> 28:35.757
As well you know, Mother.

28:35.965 --> 28:37.926
My boy!

28:38.009 --> 28:39.260
My son!

28:40.136 --> 28:43.473
Take the other end!
I will. One more.
One more tier.

28:43.556 --> 28:44.849
A bit higher there.

28:44.933 --> 28:46.392
One more!

29:01.366 --> 29:04.869
Well, it seems that
Eyvind and his family

29:04.953 --> 29:07.121
truly don't want
to be involved
in this community.

29:07.789 --> 29:11.960
They can't help being
involved, even if they
don't want to be.

29:14.003 --> 29:15.505
Poor Floki.

29:16.839 --> 29:19.759
To have brought such people
to his perfect island.

30:22.739 --> 30:23.906
Bishop Heahmund.

30:46.679 --> 30:48.222
What do you think?

30:48.598 --> 30:51.351
I have a feeling
that Bjorn is playing a game.

30:51.601 --> 30:53.019
What kind of game?

30:53.686 --> 30:56.564
Well, what if he is keeping
a lot of his army in reserve?

30:56.647 --> 30:58.399
What if this battle
is just a feint?

30:58.483 --> 31:00.943
What if his real plan
is to outflank us,

31:01.194 --> 31:04.113
and drive on and try
to destroy our boats?

31:04.280 --> 31:06.449
What should we do?

31:07.116 --> 31:11.412
I'll pull back a third
of our army
to protect our ships.

31:12.538 --> 31:14.415
It is a risk.

31:14.874 --> 31:17.085
But it would be far worse
to lose our entire fleet.

31:18.378 --> 31:21.714
So, I think we should
send Hvitserk with some men
into the woods over there,

31:21.798 --> 31:25.093
and try to outflank them,
dividing Bjorn's forces.

31:28.221 --> 31:30.348
I agree.

31:30.431 --> 31:32.683
If you take Astrid
back with you.

31:32.767 --> 31:34.560
I don't want her to die.

31:34.644 --> 31:36.521
No.
Yes.

31:36.979 --> 31:38.898
I am fighting.

31:39.190 --> 31:41.359
Not today.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.906
Ha! Ha!

31:47.824 --> 31:48.991
Ha!

31:49.075 --> 31:50.076
Move now!

31:50.159 --> 31:52.161
Move out!

31:55.206 --> 31:56.999
Be brave! Be strong!

31:59.919 --> 32:02.088
Go! Move!

32:02.171 --> 32:03.297
Now!

32:17.603 --> 32:18.688
Forward!

32:28.990 --> 32:29.991
Halt.

32:38.499 --> 32:42.211
In the name of Odin!

32:42.628 --> 32:45.214
In the name of my father!

32:48.634 --> 32:50.553
Attack!

32:53.848 --> 32:55.808
Attack!

33:33.304 --> 33:35.806
Hold! Hold!

33:39.852 --> 33:42.647
What are you doing?

33:42.730 --> 33:44.649
I have to listen.

33:44.732 --> 33:48.110
I have to know whether
I am right or wrong.

34:00.790 --> 34:02.208
Shield wall!

34:11.801 --> 34:13.094
Archers!

34:16.931 --> 34:18.015
Loose!

35:09.400 --> 35:10.985
Warriors!

35:11.444 --> 35:13.195
Charge!

36:05.122 --> 36:07.875
Go back! Move!

36:11.712 --> 36:12.963
Run!

36:14.215 --> 36:15.424
Cover!

36:55.005 --> 36:56.465
Warriors!

36:56.549 --> 36:58.717
Get ready!

36:59.051 --> 37:00.052
Charge!

37:38.132 --> 37:40.009
Still no regrets,
brother?

37:40.384 --> 37:43.387
What is there to regret?
You haven't won yet!

37:51.270 --> 37:53.856
Forward!

38:00.654 --> 38:03.866
Rear flank! Rear flank!

38:14.251 --> 38:15.336
With me!

38:15.503 --> 38:17.296
Charge!

38:47.618 --> 38:51.497
I think we should go.
And I think
we should wait.

38:51.705 --> 38:54.208
Good things happen
to people who wait.

39:29.285 --> 39:30.577
Blow the horn!

39:30.995 --> 39:32.121
Summon Ivar!

39:35.749 --> 39:37.042
They need us!

40:24.631 --> 40:26.008
They need us!

40:27.509 --> 40:28.510
It's too late.

40:28.594 --> 40:30.095
No, we have to...
It's too late!

41:32.658 --> 41:36.745
Retreat! Retreat! Retreat!

41:36.870 --> 41:38.455
- Run!
- Fall back!

41:38.539 --> 41:39.832
Run!

41:49.508 --> 41:50.843
Retreat!

41:56.432 --> 41:57.724
Retreat!

42:00.477 --> 42:01.645
Back to the camp!

42:27.421 --> 42:29.173
Get up!

42:30.924 --> 42:32.342
Make way!

42:34.178 --> 42:35.971
We are lost.

42:37.097 --> 42:38.432
Where's Heahmund?

42:39.725 --> 42:42.936
Your Christian's dead. Come.

43:13.842 --> 43:15.677
It's fate.

43:28.357 --> 43:30.859
What's this?

43:36.865 --> 43:40.244
Who is this?
He's a Saxon priest.

43:52.839 --> 43:55.300
He's alive.

43:57.219 --> 44:00.889
No! Save him.
If it's possible.

44:02.391 --> 44:04.226
Why?

44:05.227 --> 44:07.646
I don't know why.

44:07.771 --> 44:11.483
Maybe the gods
know why. Save him!
