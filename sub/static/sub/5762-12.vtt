00:21.408 --> 00:23.374
- Did you feel that?
- Yeah.

00:37.011 --> 00:39.187
Yeah. Yeah.

00:39.312 --> 00:40.692
<i>There's an apartment fire
in Town Square.</i>

00:40.819 --> 00:42.993
<i>- Yeah, I'll be right there.
- Okay.</i>

00:43.538 --> 00:46.926
Pull that hose!
Get the fastest stream on top!

00:57.175 --> 00:58.639
Let's go! Let's go!

00:58.764 --> 00:59.768
- Hey, Will.
- Hey.

00:59.895 --> 01:01.860
- What was it, gas?
Yeah, most likely.

01:01.986 --> 01:04.663
It looks like a couple of floors
collapsed on themselves.

01:04.788 --> 01:06.127
- We got to get in there.
- Yeah, we will.

01:06.252 --> 01:08.763
As soon as we get the word
that it's stable.

01:08.888 --> 01:10.018
Anyone left in the building?

01:10.143 --> 01:12.361
We won't know
until we get inside.

01:19.555 --> 01:22.819
- All clear! All clear! Come on!
- All right, that's it. Let's go.

01:22.944 --> 01:25.914
Go, go, go!
Let's go! Let's go!

01:26.793 --> 01:28.299
Anyone in here?

01:29.470 --> 01:32.900
If anybody can hear us,
make a sound. Please!

01:33.026 --> 01:34.448
Make a sound!

01:35.954 --> 01:38.548
Help me.
Will, I got one.

01:40.639 --> 01:43.024
- Hey, how are you doing?
Help me.

01:43.777 --> 01:47.876
Get me out of here.
I can't... I can't feel anything.

01:48.002 --> 01:50.805
Take it easy. Keep breathing.
We're going to get you out of here.

01:50.930 --> 01:52.561
Jim, get this one. Got it?
Got it.

01:52.687 --> 01:54.068
Let's go.

01:57.038 --> 01:58.126
Lift the beam.
All right.

01:58.251 --> 01:59.296
Come on.

02:00.593 --> 02:02.727
Come on!
It's not moving.

02:02.853 --> 02:05.823
- Come on!
It's not moving.

02:05.948 --> 02:08.166
This one.
We're going to get you out of here.

02:08.291 --> 02:09.797
Come on. Ready?

02:14.524 --> 02:17.117
Damn it.

02:17.243 --> 02:19.167
Jim. Jim, we got another one.

02:19.293 --> 02:22.806
We got two! We need more men!
We got a guy trapped!

02:22.933 --> 02:25.107
I never stopped. Never.

02:28.078 --> 02:30.755
I never stopped. Never.

02:32.470 --> 02:33.474
We'll get you out.

02:33.599 --> 02:34.813
<i>Clancy,
what's going on in there?</i>

02:34.938 --> 02:37.030
Look, I need more men.
I got a guy trapped in here. Please.

02:37.155 --> 02:38.411
<i>- Send them in!
- Listen up.</i>

02:38.536 --> 02:40.585
<i>Are you okay?
The building is unstable.</i>

02:40.712 --> 02:42.259
<i>- Evacuate now.
- Jim.</i>

02:42.385 --> 02:44.267
<i>- I repeat, evacuate now.
- Jim.</i>

02:44.393 --> 02:45.940
I'll be right back.

02:46.065 --> 02:47.530
Jim.
- What?

02:47.655 --> 02:48.785
They're calling us out.

02:48.910 --> 02:50.459
The building's too unstable
and it's coming down.

02:50.584 --> 02:52.843
- We can't leave this guy.
We got to go, it's too unstable.

02:52.968 --> 02:55.394
- Damn it. Your man can move?
- Yeah, I think so.

02:55.520 --> 02:57.402
<i>All right, let's go. Take him.
Everybody out!</i>

02:57.528 --> 02:59.076
<i>The building's going to collapse!</i>

02:59.202 --> 03:01.335
All right, grab his legs.

03:01.460 --> 03:02.673
Let's go.

03:08.697 --> 03:10.538
All right, go!
Go.

03:12.420 --> 03:14.303
Move, move, move.
- Move, move!

03:14.428 --> 03:15.767
Coming out!
Go, go, go!

03:15.892 --> 03:18.026
Let's go! We got a live one
coming out! We need a stretcher.

03:18.152 --> 03:19.156
There's still
one guy in there.

03:19.281 --> 03:20.285
What?

03:20.411 --> 03:22.669
We got to go back in there
and get him. Come on.

03:34.759 --> 03:36.893
Put him in Bay 2.

03:37.018 --> 03:39.654
It was clear. It was obvious.

03:39.779 --> 03:41.202
The guy under the beam,

03:41.327 --> 03:43.167
he was going to die
the minute they took it off of him.

03:43.293 --> 03:46.054
I mean, he was half-dead already
when I got to him.

03:46.179 --> 03:47.434
So you did the right thing.

03:47.559 --> 03:49.401
The other guy, he's sitting up,
he's looking around,

03:49.526 --> 03:51.367
he knows what's going on.

03:51.492 --> 03:52.622
I only have time to get one guy.

03:52.747 --> 03:54.714
I have to make the call
who's got the better shot.

03:54.839 --> 03:56.722
I mean, I had to.

03:57.098 --> 03:58.269
Exactly.

03:59.984 --> 04:03.080
Then why do I feel like
I just condemned a man to death?

04:03.205 --> 04:05.883
Like I...
I should have saved them both?

04:06.008 --> 04:07.681
Because you're you.

04:08.477 --> 04:10.024
That's why I love you.

04:10.986 --> 04:14.416
A man's life was saved tonight,
thanks to you.

04:15.798 --> 04:19.060
Hey, medic. We've got
a half a dozen people coming in,

04:19.185 --> 04:21.654
we're shorthanded in the ER.
Can you help us out?

04:21.779 --> 04:24.498
Yeah, I just got to scrub up.
I'll be right in.

04:25.418 --> 04:28.849
The man who was under the beam,
what was he wearing?

04:28.975 --> 04:30.690
A bathrobe, I think.

04:35.918 --> 04:38.554
- Don't even tell me.
- No. Go.

04:38.680 --> 04:39.976
All right.

05:01.855 --> 05:03.486
<i>Can you see us?</i>

05:32.978 --> 05:34.066
He's losing a lot of blood.

05:34.192 --> 05:37.998
You know, leaving that guy behind,
it was the right thing.

05:39.170 --> 05:40.969
Yeah, that's what
everybody keeps telling me.

05:41.094 --> 05:43.353
Decisions like that
get made all the time.

05:43.478 --> 05:46.198
You don't ask for them,
but you have to make the call.

05:46.323 --> 05:48.456
All you can do is focus
on the ones you can save.

05:50.632 --> 05:53.225
- You're good.
- So are you.

05:53.351 --> 05:54.898
You're sure of yourself.
That's important.

05:55.025 --> 05:58.623
Yeah, I'm not sure what I'm sure about.
Even applying to med school.

05:58.748 --> 06:01.467
- Put pressure on that right there.
- Yeah.

06:01.592 --> 06:03.558
Mid-life career change?

06:04.144 --> 06:05.399
I prefer to think of it as maybe

06:05.524 --> 06:07.156
third-of-the-way-through-my-life
career change.

06:08.495 --> 06:10.293
It's not easy, I know.

06:11.674 --> 06:14.016
Did you do something before this?

06:14.895 --> 06:17.154
It doesn't matter.
Just retract that right there.

06:17.279 --> 06:18.325
Yeah.

06:18.994 --> 06:21.002
Okay, guys, thanks,
we'll take it from here.

06:21.128 --> 06:23.094
Yeah, Doctor.
Thank you.

06:24.474 --> 06:26.190
Whoa!
What are you doing?

06:28.449 --> 06:31.335
You have to be
a little more careful, nurse.

06:32.632 --> 06:34.975
Um, sorry.

06:35.100 --> 06:37.401
Okay,
watch his blood pressure.

06:38.322 --> 06:39.744
Pulse reading.

06:45.809 --> 06:48.277
So the guy left behind
didn't make it?

06:48.403 --> 06:52.628
- He died in the building collapse.
- I'm really sorry.

06:53.674 --> 06:56.268
I just wish there was something
I could do.

06:56.393 --> 06:59.824
Yeah.
I just can't get his face out of my head.

07:01.121 --> 07:04.174
Look, I know I asked, but you didn't
see his ghost in the hospital, did you?

07:04.300 --> 07:05.470
I mean, he's not haunting me.

07:05.597 --> 07:08.482
Well, there's always ghosts
in a hospital, you know that.

07:08.609 --> 07:10.156
And I can't tell who's who.

07:10.282 --> 07:13.336
Yeah, but just something weird
happened in the ER.

07:15.552 --> 07:19.903
Look, if his ghost was around,

07:21.158 --> 07:23.542
could I talk to him through you?

07:23.669 --> 07:26.847
I mean, just to explain
what happened, why.

07:29.023 --> 07:33.541
I guess. I mean,
sometimes ghosts get angry and...

07:33.666 --> 07:36.636
Anyway, you're not being haunted,
so don't even worry about it.

07:36.762 --> 07:40.527
All right.
Well, I'm going to hit the shower.

07:40.652 --> 07:42.325
Do you want tea or juice or something?

07:42.452 --> 07:45.044
Scotch would be better. Juice is good.

08:27.714 --> 08:29.387
Do you want this in there
or by the bed?

08:29.513 --> 08:31.061
In here, please.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.260
When the curtain closes, people die.

08:40.515 --> 08:41.559
Hey.

08:42.145 --> 08:45.033
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I just...

08:45.158 --> 08:46.622
I thought you were in the shower. Duh.

08:46.748 --> 08:47.752
- Careful.
- Yeah.

08:47.877 --> 08:49.802
There's glass everywhere.

09:03.272 --> 09:06.912
Look, I don't know if you're here,
or if you're even listening.

09:07.037 --> 09:08.417
And I know
that you must be really angry

09:08.543 --> 09:10.844
about the way things turned out.

09:11.094 --> 09:13.479
I can help you, if you'll let me.

09:14.860 --> 09:18.875
You have to understand
that my husband wanted to save you.

09:19.001 --> 09:21.762
He just couldn't, and it's not his fault.

09:22.934 --> 09:25.653
You see,
he's really torn up about things,

09:25.778 --> 09:29.961
and I just think if you blame him,
he may never get over it.

09:30.087 --> 09:33.016
You see he's got a lot to deal with,

09:33.141 --> 09:36.194
and just being married to me,
that's a lot to...

09:37.993 --> 09:40.880
Anyway, I know that you've been
through something very bad,

09:41.005 --> 09:42.763
and I just want to...

09:46.401 --> 09:50.334
- Joe? Joe Grimaldi?
- Yeah.

09:52.132 --> 09:54.726
Melinda, right? Jim Clancy's wife.

09:54.852 --> 09:58.073
Yeah, we met a few years ago.
Do you still run the VFW?

09:58.198 --> 10:01.796
I volunteer there. Now I have a...
A landscaping business.

10:01.922 --> 10:03.762
You know, I keep busy.

10:05.352 --> 10:07.569
Did you lose someone in the building?

10:08.322 --> 10:09.618
My brother.

10:10.832 --> 10:12.965
They said he was trapped in there.

10:13.091 --> 10:16.228
The hospital said that he was alive
when they got to him,

10:16.354 --> 10:18.696
but they couldn't get him out.

10:18.822 --> 10:20.788
Your brother.

10:20.914 --> 10:22.838
I just had to come here.

10:23.716 --> 10:25.306
I don't know why.

10:26.812 --> 10:29.866
Just wanted to see all this
for myself, I guess.

10:29.991 --> 10:32.962
- What was your brother's name?
- Vince.

10:33.087 --> 10:36.810
I'm so sorry.
Were the two of you close?

10:38.609 --> 10:41.202
About as close as you can be, I guess.

10:44.172 --> 10:48.022
No, I guess we weren't.
And it was my fault.

10:50.657 --> 10:52.707
What if you could change all that?

10:52.832 --> 10:55.969
What would you do if you could
just talk to him one more time?

10:56.095 --> 10:57.141
What?

10:58.019 --> 11:01.492
Look, I know
how this is going to sound,

11:01.617 --> 11:05.424
but I see spirits. I can talk to them.

11:05.549 --> 11:09.439
I can help them cross over,
and your brother is still here.

11:09.565 --> 11:11.029
He's an earthbound spirit.

11:11.155 --> 11:13.999
- My brother's a ghost?
- Yes.

11:14.125 --> 11:15.798
And Jim, my husband,

11:15.924 --> 11:17.471
he was the paramedic
who found him last night.

11:17.597 --> 11:20.693
And he wanted to save him so badly,

11:20.818 --> 11:23.328
but I just think your brother's coming
after him now because he blames him.

11:23.453 --> 11:26.675
Look! I don't want to hear any of this.

11:26.800 --> 11:28.265
I don't know what it is
you're trying to sell me.

11:28.390 --> 11:31.945
- Please, just hear me out.
- It's not funny, you know?

11:32.071 --> 11:34.079
To mess
with people's emotions like this,

11:34.205 --> 11:37.426
or whatever the hell it is
you're trying to do.

11:37.551 --> 11:39.015
It's not right.

11:39.852 --> 11:41.233
Joe, please.

11:47.968 --> 11:51.858
Excuse me, nurse? Nurse Quinlan?
Do you remember me?

11:51.984 --> 11:55.205
Jim, right? The future doctor.

11:55.330 --> 11:57.422
- Feeling better?
- Well, that's debatable.

11:57.548 --> 12:00.057
Hey, I wanted to ask you.
The guy I had to leave in the building,

12:00.182 --> 12:01.479
were you here
when they brought him in?

12:01.605 --> 12:03.404
Yeah. He was DOA.

12:03.529 --> 12:07.253
But they kept him in the ER
until they reached the next of kin.

12:07.378 --> 12:11.812
Look, I want to try to talk to his family
and explain what happened.

12:11.937 --> 12:14.280
I don't think
the hospital's going to release that.

12:14.406 --> 12:17.795
Yeah, that's why I wanted to ask you.

12:20.890 --> 12:23.316
Don't do this. You know every cliché

12:23.442 --> 12:25.074
about not getting emotionally
involved with the patients.

12:25.199 --> 12:27.165
Yeah, I know all about that,
but I'll tell you, if it was me,

12:27.290 --> 12:28.629
if it was my family,

12:28.755 --> 12:30.136
I'd want to know
exactly what happened.

12:30.261 --> 12:31.431
You know, why decisions were made.

12:31.558 --> 12:34.695
No, this isn't about that guy's family.
You want to make yourself feel better.

12:34.821 --> 12:36.075
You want them to look you in the eye
and say,

12:36.201 --> 12:39.004
"It's okay, we don't hold it against you. "

12:40.928 --> 12:43.229
Okay, maybe.

12:43.354 --> 12:45.069
But you can't tell me
that family wouldn't wanna talk

12:45.194 --> 12:47.830
to the last person
that saw their son alive.

12:47.956 --> 12:50.759
Jim, you can't do this. Take it from me.
You have to be able to let go.

12:50.884 --> 12:53.603
You do your job, you do your best,
but you have to move on.

12:53.729 --> 12:56.448
You have to put up the walls,
otherwise...

12:57.284 --> 12:59.460
Otherwise you lose yourself.

13:00.129 --> 13:02.932
Just move on, save the next patient.

13:03.058 --> 13:06.153
You'll have a lot more wins than losses.
You can't let the...

13:10.378 --> 13:11.884
Hey, what are you doing?

13:12.010 --> 13:13.976
I don't know. I can't...

13:20.544 --> 13:22.008
Wait a minute.

13:22.887 --> 13:25.606
Hey, are you okay? What happened?

13:25.731 --> 13:28.868
I don't know.
I don't know what happened.

13:31.169 --> 13:34.767
I'm sorry, it...
It was some sort of spasm.

13:34.892 --> 13:37.779
No, no, look, do not be sorry.
Don't be sorry.

13:37.904 --> 13:40.163
This had nothing to do with you.

13:41.670 --> 13:42.966
I better...

13:45.267 --> 13:47.316
Are you going to be all right?

13:52.295 --> 13:56.520
So are you here, huh?
I wish I knew.

13:57.608 --> 14:02.293
I don't even know if you can hear me,
but I want to tell you that I'm sorry.

14:03.297 --> 14:05.095
If there was anything else
I could've tried...

14:05.221 --> 14:09.237
If there was any way to save you,
I would have done it, I promise.

14:15.638 --> 14:19.779
But you were so badly hurt.

14:19.904 --> 14:23.502
I knew you were going to die.
I could see it in your eyes.

14:24.799 --> 14:29.986
Leaving you there like that was the
hardest thing I've ever done in my life.

14:34.671 --> 14:36.679
I'm not real good at this.

14:39.105 --> 14:41.741
My wife would know what to say to you.

14:41.867 --> 14:46.091
She knows how to handle grief.
She knows how to handle loss.

14:46.218 --> 14:47.681
Me, not so much.

14:48.685 --> 14:50.400
For so many people,

14:52.242 --> 14:54.709
she knows how to make a difference.

14:57.638 --> 15:02.030
I'm not sure I do,
in the grand scheme of things.

15:02.825 --> 15:06.883
But, look, for whatever it's worth,

15:10.773 --> 15:14.287
accept my apology for what it is.

15:15.291 --> 15:17.885
If you want to punish me, here I am.

15:18.010 --> 15:22.444
But do not take it out
on the people around me.

15:23.574 --> 15:25.331
Or the people I love.

15:31.145 --> 15:32.652
Jim, I'm home.

15:32.777 --> 15:34.116
That's her.

15:36.626 --> 15:38.926
Honey, I'll be down in a minute.

15:42.022 --> 15:43.486
Look, I know
that you have no reason to,

15:43.611 --> 15:45.912
but I really need you
to take a leap of faith.

15:46.038 --> 15:47.669
I know that you would want
your brother to be at peace,

15:47.795 --> 15:49.970
and you can help him do that.

15:51.058 --> 15:53.485
When I left you last night,

15:53.610 --> 15:56.370
I did something
I haven't done in probably 30 years.

15:56.497 --> 15:57.542
What?

15:58.630 --> 16:00.386
I cried. Like a baby.

16:02.394 --> 16:05.741
This isn't just about
not believing in ghosts, is it?

16:09.799 --> 16:13.355
The truth is I was a lousy brother.

16:14.694 --> 16:17.957
I did things.
Things that I'm ashamed of.

16:21.011 --> 16:24.817
About a month or so ago,
I sent Vince a letter.

16:24.942 --> 16:29.586
I tried to explain.
I asked him to forgive me.

16:29.712 --> 16:30.841
I didn't hear back.

16:30.966 --> 16:35.108
Yeah, but this could be your chance
to do it in person. Kind of.

16:35.233 --> 16:38.538
If it's true, and Vince is out there...

16:38.664 --> 16:40.546
Look, I could stand here all day
and talk to you

16:40.672 --> 16:43.767
about unfinished business
and the importance of closure,

16:43.893 --> 16:46.068
but there's much more at stake.

16:46.194 --> 16:50.921
I really believe that your brother's ghost
is trying to hurt my husband.

16:51.046 --> 16:53.598
You're the only one that can help me.

16:56.066 --> 16:59.036
Ghosts usually come back
to where they died.

16:59.162 --> 17:02.508
Your brother knows that I can see him,
so if he senses me here,

17:02.634 --> 17:05.311
maybe he'll come to me.

17:05.436 --> 17:07.905
<i>Dr Lewis, please call
the pharmacy.</i>

17:08.031 --> 17:09.954
<i>Dr Lewis, please call the pharmacy.</i>

17:12.339 --> 17:15.895
If you're here,
I've brought someone to talk to you.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.571
Please.

17:30.202 --> 17:32.084
He's here.

17:32.210 --> 17:35.054
Just speak from your heart,
he can hear you.

17:38.318 --> 17:42.668
I really don't know how to do all this,
or where to start.

17:46.768 --> 17:49.319
If you're really here,

17:50.700 --> 17:53.000
I just want to say I'm sorry.

17:56.055 --> 17:58.271
It's not like you went out of your way
to stay in touch.

17:58.398 --> 18:01.953
I mean, I don't know
why you couldn't pick up the phone.

18:02.078 --> 18:06.220
Yeah. I guess none of that matters.

18:07.433 --> 18:11.240
The thing is, Vince,
I owe you an apology.

18:12.537 --> 18:14.712
When we had that big fight
that Christmas,

18:14.837 --> 18:19.439
I said things I shouldn't have said.
Things I didn't really mean.

18:19.564 --> 18:23.623
Things that changed everything
between us.

18:23.748 --> 18:26.635
If I could take it all back, I would.

18:26.760 --> 18:31.194
I sent you that letter,
and when I didn't get an answer,

18:31.319 --> 18:35.419
I figured you were through with me
and I didn't blame you.

18:35.545 --> 18:41.694
Anyway, I hope you can find it
in your heart to forgive me.

18:44.580 --> 18:45.751
Please.

18:47.927 --> 18:50.312
Is there anything you want to say?

18:53.700 --> 18:57.214
- Yeah. Who is this guy?
- Your brother.

18:57.340 --> 18:59.180
I don't have a brother.

18:59.933 --> 19:02.652
Well, does he forgive me?

19:06.208 --> 19:09.011
Didn't you die in the building collapse?

19:09.136 --> 19:12.023
- What building collapse?
- What's going on?

19:12.148 --> 19:13.905
Well, if you didn't die
in the building collapse,

19:14.031 --> 19:15.537
then why are you
haunting my husband?

19:15.662 --> 19:17.754
I couldn't care less about
your husband.

19:17.879 --> 19:19.386
She's the one I want.

19:20.640 --> 19:22.731
She's the one who killed me.

19:25.325 --> 19:26.413
Okay.

19:32.395 --> 19:33.943
What's going on?

19:40.134 --> 19:41.473
I should've known
this couldn't be real.

19:41.599 --> 19:42.979
Look, it is real, okay?

19:43.104 --> 19:44.778
I just made a mix-up,
and I'm really sorry.

19:44.903 --> 19:47.999
So what, I just poured my heart out
to some dead guy I don't even know?

19:48.124 --> 19:50.342
Look, it means that
your brother crossed over right away.

19:50.467 --> 19:52.350
That he's at peace, okay?
That's a good thing.

19:52.475 --> 19:55.152
Well, maybe he's at peace, but I'm not.

20:01.929 --> 20:04.565
So it wasn't his brother,
it was another guy altogether.

20:04.690 --> 20:06.448
The good news is the ghost
that I thought was haunting you

20:06.573 --> 20:07.911
wasn't haunting you. The bad news...

20:08.037 --> 20:09.292
Wait a minute.

20:10.296 --> 20:12.471
Wait a minute, back up here, Mel.
You told me in the hospital

20:12.597 --> 20:15.065
that you thought
there was not a ghost haunting me.

20:15.191 --> 20:16.445
Well, you know what?

20:16.571 --> 20:18.621
You were really upset,
and I just didn't want to add to it

20:18.746 --> 20:20.252
by telling you that
there was an angry ghost in...

20:20.377 --> 20:22.637
I just wanted to talk this guy.
I wanted to tell him how sorry I was.

20:22.762 --> 20:25.732
This ghost was not in the mood to talk.
He's all about revenge.

20:25.857 --> 20:28.117
Mel, this is wrong, okay?
I don't need to be protected,

20:28.242 --> 20:29.497
and I don't need
to be treated like a child.

20:29.623 --> 20:31.296
I was not treating you like a child.

20:31.421 --> 20:33.973
I was actually looking out for you
a little, like you do for me.

20:34.099 --> 20:35.981
You don't let me look out for you.

20:36.107 --> 20:38.073
And here I am, trying to find
the next of kin to this guy,

20:38.198 --> 20:40.416
somebody to talk to, you're talking
to his brother behind my back.

20:40.541 --> 20:42.842
- It wasn't his brother!
- So what?

20:45.143 --> 20:49.242
Look, I know that I screwed up here,
and we will talk about this later.

20:49.367 --> 20:52.171
Okay? But for right now,
I've really got to get a pin in this thing.

20:52.296 --> 20:55.391
I mean, this ghost is haunting
some nurse at Driscoll.

20:55.517 --> 20:59.491
Jennifer Quinlan.
And he says that she killed him.

20:59.617 --> 21:01.708
What? Wait, is that credible?
Is that true?

21:01.833 --> 21:04.134
I don't know.
I mean, he's been very confused

21:04.261 --> 21:05.348
and a little hard to figure out,

21:05.473 --> 21:08.025
but I did get a name.
Peter. Peter Harrison.

21:08.150 --> 21:10.661
Wait, I know this nurse, okay?
She's solid. She's solid.

21:10.786 --> 21:12.166
What's happening here
is what happened to me.

21:12.292 --> 21:14.258
She had a patient,
he died, he's blaming her.

21:14.384 --> 21:16.810
Well, I need to check online
and see if I can find anything.

21:16.935 --> 21:19.028
In the meantime,
can you please just check on Jennifer

21:19.153 --> 21:21.579
and how Peter Harrison died?

21:21.705 --> 21:24.466
Yeah. Yeah,
I'll check on her when I go in.

21:24.591 --> 21:28.355
- We'll talk about the rest of this later.
- Whatever you want.

21:40.069 --> 21:41.910
Hey, calling it a night?

21:42.035 --> 21:44.712
- Yeah. Just worked a double.
- Boy.

21:46.302 --> 21:48.561
So how are you liking Grandview?

21:48.687 --> 21:53.832
It's okay. A little provincial, maybe.
Still getting my bearings.

21:53.958 --> 21:56.216
Yeah? Where'd you work before?

21:56.342 --> 21:59.103
I moved around a lot.
I've been a bit of a gypsy.

21:59.228 --> 22:01.697
Yeah? But always hospitals, huh?

22:03.077 --> 22:04.834
Are you doing my bio?

22:05.963 --> 22:08.515
Yeah. Look, I'm sorry.
This is going to sound a little weird,

22:08.641 --> 22:12.113
but I came across a name, a patient

22:12.238 --> 22:15.669
I was wondering if you might know.
Peter Harrison.

22:17.677 --> 22:19.183
What is it you want to know?

22:19.308 --> 22:22.152
I want to know
if you know if this patient died,

22:22.278 --> 22:24.495
and if there were any circumstances
surrounding his death

22:24.621 --> 22:26.671
that were a little strange.

22:28.721 --> 22:30.687
You remember
how I told you how important it was

22:30.812 --> 22:32.737
not to get personally involved
with patients?

22:32.862 --> 22:33.907
Yeah.

22:34.034 --> 22:37.254
Well, I wasn't always good
at taking my own advice.

22:38.844 --> 22:42.149
Peter Harrison was
a patient of mine at my old job,

22:42.274 --> 22:46.248
and he was very sick,
and I came to care for him very much.

22:47.252 --> 22:48.508
Too much.

22:49.219 --> 22:52.858
And when he died,
well, I was just wrecked.

22:52.983 --> 22:57.627
I felt helpless and alone, and I knew
I should never have let it go that far.

22:58.421 --> 22:59.970
So you quit?

23:00.806 --> 23:04.320
I wanted to start over someplace
where I didn't know anybody.

23:04.445 --> 23:07.039
Where maybe
I would never know anybody.

23:07.164 --> 23:09.758
- That's it?
- What did you think?

23:10.762 --> 23:14.360
Nothing. I'm sorry. I was just curious.

23:16.327 --> 23:19.547
- Well, I should probably get going.
- Yeah, goodbye.

24:36.226 --> 24:39.155
No, don't! Please don't!

24:41.581 --> 24:44.217
When the curtain closed, I died.

24:45.639 --> 24:47.397
Did someone kill you?

24:48.108 --> 24:52.417
- Was it the nurse? Nurse Quinlan?
- No. It was my doctor.

24:53.504 --> 24:55.595
Dr Sutherland.

24:55.721 --> 24:59.110
No! No! Please, don't!

26:11.647 --> 26:14.576
Jim. Come on in, buddy.

26:14.701 --> 26:16.417
- Thanks, Reed.
- Yeah.

26:19.805 --> 26:23.109
Well, listen, I got nothing.

26:23.821 --> 26:24.992
You mean like nothing suspicious?

26:25.117 --> 26:28.590
No, I mean, like nothing like in nothing.
Look, six months ago,

26:28.715 --> 26:32.313
Jennifer Quinlan, she shows up
in Grandview, rents an apartment,

26:32.438 --> 26:35.826
puts all her paperwork through
the DMV, and the next thing you know,

26:35.953 --> 26:38.295
she's got a job
at the Driscoll County Medical Centre.

26:38.420 --> 26:39.969
All right, but what about before that?

26:40.094 --> 26:42.854
Jim, I'm telling you...
Nothing.

26:42.981 --> 26:44.193
It's like she dropped out of the sky.

26:44.319 --> 26:46.536
I mean, she's got
a fake social security number, yeah,

26:46.662 --> 26:48.251
but no other documentation
of any kind.

26:48.377 --> 26:50.886
I mean, not in Driscoll County,
not in the Northeast.

26:51.013 --> 26:54.066
It's like she's got no past.
Like she's a ghost.

26:55.028 --> 26:56.785
She can't be all bad.

26:57.748 --> 27:00.257
- She does volunteer work.
- Where?

27:25.231 --> 27:27.867
You're going to let her do this again?

27:50.206 --> 27:51.711
Can I help you?

27:53.636 --> 27:55.100
I'm sorry.

27:55.226 --> 27:58.321
- Do I know you?
- No. I don't think so. I'm sorry.

28:28.901 --> 28:30.783
All this from a bumper.

29:27.090 --> 29:28.471
<i>Hello?
- Jim?</i>

29:38.385 --> 29:41.313
Jim. What are you doing here?

29:42.610 --> 29:45.413
I'm just looking for you, Dr Sutherland.

29:46.040 --> 29:48.676
You want to talk to me? Wait a minute.

29:49.763 --> 29:52.775
Nora, talk to me about Peter Harrison.

29:53.989 --> 29:57.335
Or were there others?
Like Peter Harrison's father?

29:57.460 --> 30:01.351
You shouldn't stick your nose
into other people's business, Jim.

30:09.007 --> 30:10.889
I just need this ghost to come to me.

30:11.015 --> 30:12.354
I need something more credible,
you know.

30:12.479 --> 30:14.194
Something I can actually
go to the police with.

30:14.320 --> 30:16.160
Yeah,
but why would the ghost come to you

30:16.285 --> 30:17.917
if it was haunting Dr Sutherland?

30:18.043 --> 30:19.047
I don't know, probably 'cause he knows

30:19.172 --> 30:20.469
that I'm the only one who can see him.

30:20.594 --> 30:22.644
There was no suspicion,
no investigation,

30:22.770 --> 30:24.024
of the San Diego hospital?

30:24.150 --> 30:27.747
Not that I could find. She quit,
and nobody ever saw her again.

30:27.873 --> 30:31.429
Hey, I just came from the hospital,
and Jennifer or Nora Sutherland,

30:31.555 --> 30:33.311
whoever she is,
didn't show up for her shift,

30:33.437 --> 30:34.441
her phone's not picking up,

30:34.567 --> 30:36.658
and she hasn't returned
any of her pages.

30:36.783 --> 30:37.787
She skipped town.

30:37.913 --> 30:39.335
Yeah, well,
what if the ghost skipped with her?

30:39.461 --> 30:42.306
I mean, what if she just shows up
in a new city with a new identity

30:42.431 --> 30:44.021
and kills more people?

30:44.146 --> 30:45.987
There's not a damn thing
we can do without proof.

30:46.112 --> 30:48.371
Okay, you know what?
I need to go home and try something.

30:48.497 --> 30:49.752
- Do you mind?
No, no.

30:49.877 --> 30:51.049
Go. Go do what you have to do.

30:51.174 --> 30:53.977
I promise I'll give you, like,
a month off when this is over.

30:54.103 --> 30:55.692
Call me.
I will.

31:05.899 --> 31:09.121
I really need to talk to you.

31:09.246 --> 31:12.593
The doctor that killed you,
Dr Nora Sutherland,

31:12.718 --> 31:16.106
probably at Sisters of Angels Hospital
in San Diego.

31:23.176 --> 31:25.686
I really need to know what happened.

31:28.029 --> 31:31.208
Any details that I could give the police.

31:31.334 --> 31:33.927
Dr Sutherland,
did she treat your father also?

31:34.053 --> 31:35.685
My father? I don't think so.

31:35.810 --> 31:38.194
Look, you may not be the only person
that she did this to.

31:38.320 --> 31:41.206
And she could do it again,
so please, you have to try...

31:43.424 --> 31:46.351
I remember getting sick.
I was in the hospital for a long time.

31:47.941 --> 31:50.452
Well, we've ruled out a bunch of things,
which is good news,

31:50.577 --> 31:53.756
but we're still going to have to
work you up some more tomorrow.

31:53.882 --> 31:56.308
I don't want you to worry
about anything.

31:56.433 --> 31:58.399
I'm going to be with you on this,
every step of the way.

31:58.525 --> 32:01.662
I started...
I was getting confused, feeling lost.

32:04.215 --> 32:06.515
She was there every day for me.

32:12.413 --> 32:14.338
I fell in love with her.

32:16.388 --> 32:19.148
She made me feel so young,
just like I could do anything.

32:19.274 --> 32:21.951
- So what happened?
- I don't know.

32:22.077 --> 32:25.717
- Please, you have to try.
- No, I do know.

32:29.063 --> 32:31.908
<i>Well, one night she came to me.</i>

32:32.033 --> 32:34.961
<i>I was so sick that night,
but I couldn't even speak.</i>

32:35.086 --> 32:36.593
<i>I was helpless.</i>

32:45.378 --> 32:49.184
The thing is, like, I still feel love for her.

32:50.021 --> 32:54.079
Even now, remembering all this.
I just... I want to know why.

32:54.204 --> 32:57.802
- How she could do this to me.
- Peter, I really need you to concentrate.

32:57.927 --> 33:02.319
I need you to see Dr Sutherland,
and I need you to tell me where she is.

33:05.039 --> 33:06.628
The bus station.

33:09.767 --> 33:10.896
Yeah, I'm heading to the bus station,

33:11.021 --> 33:13.197
and it'll probably be the first day
that bus is actually on time.

33:16.460 --> 33:18.718
<i>Hey, did you ask
if the other ghost is his father?</i>

33:18.844 --> 33:20.391
There is no other ghost.

33:20.518 --> 33:21.522
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

33:21.647 --> 33:24.784
Both ghosts, same guy.
I'll explain it later. Bye.

33:27.378 --> 33:32.105
<i>Express bus boarding
momentarily. Have your tickets ready.</i>

33:41.309 --> 33:45.701
No, don't walk away. Talk to me.
It's time for you to do the right thing.

33:47.374 --> 33:50.637
Peter Harrison told me that
you injected something into his IV drip,

33:50.763 --> 33:53.356
that you closed the curtains,
and that you killed him.

34:02.141 --> 34:03.396
I did it.

34:06.115 --> 34:08.750
- I killed Pete.
- Why?

34:10.507 --> 34:12.431
Because he begged me to.

34:17.870 --> 34:21.216
Peter Harrison is an older man, right?

34:21.342 --> 34:23.601
Are you really saying
you've seen his ghost?

34:23.726 --> 34:27.993
He kept coming to me as a young man.
He was really confused and then...

34:29.206 --> 34:32.092
And then he told me
that you made him feel young.

34:32.219 --> 34:35.900
So I figured out that that's why
I saw him as his younger self.

34:36.025 --> 34:37.991
Ghosts sometimes do that.

34:41.213 --> 34:42.510
He was 78.

34:43.681 --> 34:46.440
End stage Alzheimer's
and a lot of other problems.

34:46.568 --> 34:49.830
He was with us for months.
He had no family.

34:49.956 --> 34:52.884
He had outlived all of his friends.
He was truly alone in the world.

34:53.010 --> 34:54.431
But he just...

34:55.351 --> 34:56.984
I don't know, he had this spark.

34:57.988 --> 35:01.711
<i>He had this amazing life,
had adventures all over the world.</i>

35:02.923 --> 35:05.727
<i>Sometimes he would forget
he was old.</i>

35:05.852 --> 35:07.484
<i>You really believed
he was a young man</i>

35:07.609 --> 35:09.868
<i>with everything in front of him.</i>

35:10.328 --> 35:12.838
<i>I never knew anyone like that before.</i>

35:13.383 --> 35:15.306
I had spent my whole life
obsessed with my career.

35:15.432 --> 35:17.356
I moved through the world
with blinders on.

35:17.482 --> 35:22.041
I never once stopped to look at life
the way this crazy, sick old man did.

35:23.255 --> 35:26.392
And I never looked at it
the same way again.

35:26.518 --> 35:28.902
We became dependent on each other.

35:30.283 --> 35:33.336
I shouldn't have still been his doctor,

35:33.462 --> 35:36.432
but I didn't trust anyone else
to be with him.

35:38.273 --> 35:40.490
And things got harder.

35:40.616 --> 35:45.091
The disease progressed, and he sort of
withdrew into some place in his head

35:45.217 --> 35:46.723
<i>where I couldn't reach him.</i>

35:46.848 --> 35:48.522
<i>I knew he was suffering.</i>

35:48.647 --> 35:51.408
<i>I knew he hated
what was happening to him.</i>

35:52.538 --> 35:53.876
<i>One night,</i>

35:54.001 --> 35:56.888
<i>- all of a sudden, he got real clear.
- Please.</i>

35:57.724 --> 35:59.021
Let me go.

36:00.904 --> 36:03.037
Make this stop.

36:05.422 --> 36:07.890
Please, kill me.

36:09.940 --> 36:14.165
<i>I saw so much suffering
every day in that hospital.</i>

36:41.021 --> 36:42.193
Goodbye.

37:02.357 --> 37:04.573
I held his hand while he died.

37:05.745 --> 37:09.133
And then I felt the most awful guilt.

37:09.259 --> 37:13.484
I realised I had violated my oath.
I had no right to do what I did.

37:14.363 --> 37:16.831
I didn't think
I deserved to be a doctor any more.

37:16.956 --> 37:20.763
So I started over. Or at least I tried to.

37:22.855 --> 37:27.372
You did what I asked you to do.
And I loved you for it.

37:31.263 --> 37:33.313
Listen, Peter's still here.

37:34.861 --> 37:37.078
His spirit is with us right now.

37:37.204 --> 37:38.626
I blamed her.

37:39.755 --> 37:43.896
At the last second, I became so afraid.

37:45.319 --> 37:46.866
Afraid of dying.

37:47.996 --> 37:51.468
And after I was dead,
I couldn't remember why.

37:53.142 --> 37:56.279
Except her, giving me that injection.

37:56.405 --> 37:59.793
He wants you to know
how confused he was when he died.

38:01.340 --> 38:04.604
He thinks I killed him. Murdered him.

38:04.729 --> 38:06.779
But now he knows
what really happened.

38:06.905 --> 38:09.958
He knows that
you were just trying to help him.

38:13.222 --> 38:17.781
Peter, if you can hear me, I'm so sorry.
I never should have done it.

38:18.826 --> 38:20.709
You gave me so much.

38:22.131 --> 38:24.977
Tell her how much she gave me.

38:25.102 --> 38:27.947
Just by listening, just by...

38:30.373 --> 38:31.878
By being there.

38:33.385 --> 38:36.732
I couldn't have had a better friend.

38:36.857 --> 38:40.162
She made those last few months
so rich.

38:40.287 --> 38:42.964
He wants you to know
how much you gave him.

38:43.090 --> 38:46.980
Having you as a friend
made his last months so rich.

38:47.106 --> 38:51.247
Having you for a friend made
my life so rich, Pete.

38:51.373 --> 38:52.879
I'll never forget you.

38:58.735 --> 39:04.090
I think I have to go now.
So many old friends waiting for me.

39:05.512 --> 39:07.102
Right over there.

39:08.650 --> 39:10.448
He's ready to cross over now.

39:10.574 --> 39:12.958
Well, does that mean I'll never...

39:14.381 --> 39:16.807
That he'll never be near me again?

39:17.936 --> 39:22.998
No. Tell her I'll watch over her
like a father would.

39:26.052 --> 39:28.311
The way she watched over me.

39:34.293 --> 39:37.264
He said you'll always be
like a daughter to him.

39:37.389 --> 39:39.773
He'll always be watching over you.

39:48.015 --> 39:50.943
I guess I have to go back
and own up now, don't I?

39:51.068 --> 39:52.658
What do you think?

40:11.273 --> 40:15.248
Jim, I'm sorry
that I held things back from you.

40:15.373 --> 40:17.842
And I know
that you don't need to be protected.

40:17.967 --> 40:20.561
I just feel like I make your life
so complicated sometimes.

40:20.686 --> 40:22.777
And I was trying to spare you

40:22.903 --> 40:25.203
of any more stress
than I already bring you.

40:25.329 --> 40:27.797
You don't bring me any stress, Mel.

40:29.304 --> 40:32.734
- Okay, maybe a little, but...
- Yeah.

40:32.859 --> 40:35.954
I can't think of a smaller price to pay for
everything else you bring me.

40:36.080 --> 40:38.255
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:39.594 --> 40:40.598
You're not going to get fed up

40:40.724 --> 40:45.032
and dump me for one of those girls
who only sees ghosts in the movies?

40:45.158 --> 40:48.295
I'd be bored out of my skull
in about 10 minutes.

40:57.499 --> 41:00.553
I know how much
it would have meant to you

41:00.678 --> 41:04.359
to talk to a relative of the man
that died in that building.

41:05.363 --> 41:08.207
- Yeah.
- There's your chance.

41:11.805 --> 41:14.566
- Joe Grimaldi?
- He's the brother.

41:24.899 --> 41:28.329
I can't tell you how much
I wanted to get him out of there.

41:28.455 --> 41:32.596
To save him. But he was trapped,
and he was really badly hurt.

41:32.721 --> 41:35.608
The other guy was going to live.

41:35.733 --> 41:37.909
I had to make the choice.

41:38.034 --> 41:41.172
He wasn't going to make it?
No matter what, huh?

41:41.298 --> 41:42.302
No.

41:44.561 --> 41:47.322
If it helps any, he wasn't in any pain.

41:47.447 --> 41:51.211
I mean, he wasn't suffering.
I don't think he had any feeling.

41:54.098 --> 41:55.562
I'm sorry, Joe.

41:57.235 --> 42:00.499
Did he say anything, my brother?

42:00.624 --> 42:03.636
No, he wasn't making much sense.
You know they're...

42:03.762 --> 42:06.774
No, I'm wrong. He did say something.

42:06.899 --> 42:10.915
He said, "I never stopped. Never. "

42:16.688 --> 42:19.658
- Joe?
- Does that mean something to you?

42:19.783 --> 42:22.252
I sent my brother a letter.

42:22.377 --> 42:25.766
Asking him to forgive me
for the things I said to him.

42:27.565 --> 42:31.037
And the last thing
I wrote in that letter was,

42:32.166 --> 42:37.730
"I wouldn't blame you if you stopped
loving me a long time ago. "

42:39.947 --> 42:44.758
- Do you think that means that...
- Yes. He forgave you.

42:45.846 --> 42:49.736
And you were the last thing
he was thinking about when he died.

42:53.668 --> 42:54.672
Wow.

42:57.056 --> 43:00.613
I feel like... Like 100 pounds lighter.

43:00.738 --> 43:02.997
Like everything is okay.

43:04.210 --> 43:05.799
Hey, hey.

43:11.322 --> 43:14.376
Just thanks, thanks. Okay. Thanks.

43:15.589 --> 43:16.928
No problem.

43:21.780 --> 43:23.328
Congratulations.

43:25.127 --> 43:28.264
You just made it through
your first crossing over. Sort of.

43:28.390 --> 43:30.606
Wow. That's a feeling.

43:32.155 --> 43:35.501
I mean, just to know
you brought somebody a little peace,

43:35.626 --> 43:37.341
even by accident.

43:37.468 --> 43:41.860
Look, I don't want you to ever feel
like you don't make a difference.

43:44.328 --> 43:46.880
Or that I could make more
of a difference than you.

43:47.005 --> 43:49.180
Sometimes it's just
about the little things,

43:49.306 --> 43:52.025
the things that you do
day in and day out.

43:53.071 --> 43:55.832
The things
that you do every single day,

43:57.756 --> 44:00.224
that's what makes a real difference
in the world.

44:00.350 --> 44:02.859
You heard me talking to that ghost,
didn't you?

44:02.986 --> 44:04.198
A little.

44:08.842 --> 44:10.306
Let's go home.
