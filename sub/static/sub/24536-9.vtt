- <i>Previously on</i> "The Originals"...
- <i>Mardi Gras</i>.

00:02.532 --> 00:04.083
<i>In spite of all our
differences,</i>

00:04.161 --> 00:06.936
<i>the whole city celebrates
Carnival season together.</i>

00:07.013 --> 00:08.587
It's time for vampires

00:08.664 --> 00:11.189
to reclaim
our place as the apex predator

00:11.266 --> 00:12.433
and rid the community

00:12.510 --> 00:14.072
of its abominations.

00:14.327 --> 00:15.668
It's called
a Chambre de Chasse.

00:15.745 --> 00:17.351
It's a magical mental prison.

00:17.428 --> 00:18.520
There's always a way out.

00:18.597 --> 00:19.834
Hope was at St. Anne's.

00:19.911 --> 00:22.030
She's gathering up all of you
to take back the power

00:22.107 --> 00:23.603
that's been split up
inside of you.

00:23.680 --> 00:25.348
It'll destroy her.

00:26.122 --> 00:27.170
Ominous weather.

00:27.247 --> 00:28.256
It's an indication

00:28.333 --> 00:30.147
of what's actually happening
in New Orleans.

00:30.224 --> 00:33.291
We got to get out of here.
The city is about to wash away.

00:33.461 --> 00:35.790
Hope asked for my help.
The one time

00:35.867 --> 00:38.012
she acted out
is because she missed her dad.

00:38.089 --> 00:39.503
You have to stop her.

00:39.580 --> 00:40.543
No.

00:48.428 --> 00:49.690
You need me.

00:49.767 --> 00:51.352
And I need you.

01:07.022 --> 01:10.511
The curse that plagued
our family for seven years

01:10.588 --> 01:13.008
has taken its toll
on all of us.

01:13.561 --> 01:15.274
On our city.

01:16.740 --> 01:18.359
On our home.

01:19.350 --> 01:20.984
On our family.

01:23.311 --> 01:25.131
The consequences

01:25.544 --> 01:28.055
of us being together were grave,

01:28.141 --> 01:32.068
but today,
thanks to you,

01:32.145 --> 01:33.891
we celebrate
a new beginning.

01:33.968 --> 01:36.942
One in which we have the freedom

01:37.019 --> 01:38.738
to stand side by side.

01:38.815 --> 01:39.991
And whatever trials

01:40.068 --> 01:43.443
may come,
we will face them... together,

01:43.652 --> 01:45.068
as a family.

01:45.355 --> 01:46.889
Always and forever.

01:51.818 --> 01:53.975
Would you please
pass the beignets?

01:54.052 --> 01:55.434
Of course.

01:55.774 --> 01:57.093
So, Rebekah

01:57.170 --> 01:58.865
will be back in a few days.

01:58.942 --> 02:01.859
She's just tying up
some loose ends overseas.

02:01.951 --> 02:03.251
It'll be nice
to have her here.

02:03.328 --> 02:06.678
It'll be good to have all of us
under one roof again.

02:14.332 --> 02:15.703
Good morning.

02:20.645 --> 02:23.318
Obviously, there is a lot
for us to discuss.

02:25.283 --> 02:26.343
Hope, let me begin

02:26.420 --> 02:29.068
by telling you
how truly sorry...

02:29.159 --> 02:30.537
Thanks for breakfast,
guys,

02:30.614 --> 02:33.003
but I have homework
to catch up on.

02:41.197 --> 02:43.132
That's not normal.

02:43.209 --> 02:44.578
She's not normal.

02:44.655 --> 02:46.831
She lost her mother, Niklaus.

02:48.587 --> 02:50.127
I shouldn't have
come down here.

02:50.204 --> 02:52.680
At least you can claim amnesia,
unlike our sister,

02:52.757 --> 02:54.323
who willingly aided a child

02:54.400 --> 02:55.517
in ruining her life.

02:55.594 --> 02:57.000
Hope is not a child.

02:57.077 --> 02:58.329
Did you even consider

02:58.406 --> 03:00.493
what absorbing all that magic
could do to her?

03:00.570 --> 03:02.837
- And what choice did I have?
- Deny her.

03:03.667 --> 03:05.573
Defy her.
We had a plan

03:05.650 --> 03:07.418
to keep the dark magic
away from her.

03:07.495 --> 03:09.558
A plan that wasn't working.

03:09.681 --> 03:12.636
Yes, well, thanks to you,
the magic has her now.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.667
So, if my daughter
should be harmed

03:15.744 --> 03:17.534
in any way, shape or form,

03:17.611 --> 03:20.551
I will hold you
personally responsible.

03:26.766 --> 03:29.106

03:33.156 --> 03:34.985
Looks like Emmett
and his nightwalkers

03:35.062 --> 03:37.300
rode out the storm
on your dime.

03:40.829 --> 03:42.072
Yeah.

03:42.571 --> 03:45.816
Is it wrong that I want
to boil everything in bleach?

03:50.115 --> 03:51.761
Hey, tell me...

03:52.392 --> 03:55.047
what part of "I hate
everything you stand for"

03:55.124 --> 03:57.504
do you think gave them
the "mi casa, su casa" vibe?

03:57.581 --> 03:59.694
Yeah, that's the thing.

03:59.771 --> 04:01.634
They don't care what you think.

04:01.711 --> 04:04.175
Or what anybody else thinks,
for that matter.

04:04.704 --> 04:06.321
"We are deeply disturbed

04:06.398 --> 04:09.221
"by the increased violence
in New Orleans.

04:09.298 --> 04:12.315
"There was a time not long ago
when the species coexisted

04:12.392 --> 04:14.696
"because there was order
in the city. Boundaries.

04:14.773 --> 04:16.822
"Everyone knew their place.

04:17.048 --> 04:19.117
"In an effort
to restore stability,

04:19.194 --> 04:21.370
"the vampires reclaim
the French Quarter

04:21.447 --> 04:24.277
- as their rightful home."
- Blah, blah, blah.

04:24.657 --> 04:27.680
They're demanding the werewolves
move back out to the bayou.

04:27.757 --> 04:30.893
Who?
These idiot vampire purists.

04:31.103 --> 04:33.769
Well, another good reason I'm
glad to get out of New Orleans.

04:33.846 --> 04:34.956
You're leaving?

04:35.033 --> 04:37.410
Yeah, first thing
in the morning.

04:37.608 --> 04:39.748
I thought you and Freya
were back together.

04:39.825 --> 04:41.728
- At the funeral...
- No, I love her.

04:42.355 --> 04:45.384
I always will, but...

04:46.046 --> 04:49.290
Whatever, she can't
actually be with me, so...

04:49.937 --> 04:51.574
There's always something
with her family,

04:51.651 --> 04:52.996
and her family's...

04:53.073 --> 04:55.353
- complicated.
- Yeah.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.495
Sh-She has to be here,

05:01.572 --> 05:03.403
and I need to be
somewhere in the world

05:03.480 --> 05:05.321
where I can make a difference.

05:06.155 --> 05:08.597
- You've got to be kidding me.
- Oh.

05:31.916 --> 05:34.114
I know you're there.

05:37.414 --> 05:39.366
I didn't want to disturb you.

05:40.315 --> 05:41.478
Dad, if you're worried,

05:41.555 --> 05:43.520
I'd wish you
just say something.

05:43.886 --> 05:46.708
Helicopter parenting
isn't really your thing.

05:49.742 --> 05:51.824
You bent a fork in half.

05:53.593 --> 05:56.505
Better than sticking it
in the side of Elijah's neck.

05:56.627 --> 05:58.085
He wasn't himself, Hope.

05:58.162 --> 05:59.497
I don't care.

06:00.643 --> 06:02.559
Okay? I'm not ready
to forgive him,

06:02.636 --> 06:04.247
memory or not.

06:04.690 --> 06:07.098
So, it's just Elijah, then?
Nothing more?

06:09.112 --> 06:10.225
All right.

06:10.323 --> 06:12.981
I'll keep saying this
until you believe me:

06:13.775 --> 06:15.042
I'm okay.

06:15.210 --> 06:16.659
I promise.

06:18.143 --> 06:20.504
Look, I know that you think

06:20.581 --> 06:22.733
I made a mistake
doing that spell,

06:22.810 --> 06:26.059
but I swear
I thought it all out.

06:26.150 --> 06:27.661
And you know what,
I'd do it again,

06:27.738 --> 06:29.627
because for once
we're in the same room,

06:29.704 --> 06:31.669
and the world's not ending.

06:35.659 --> 06:38.169
You know, every day

06:38.698 --> 06:40.305
I marvel at your strength

06:40.382 --> 06:41.857
and your grace,

06:42.448 --> 06:44.966
all of which certainly came
from your mother.

06:53.020 --> 06:55.028
I wish she were here.

06:58.019 --> 06:59.958
Yeah, so do I.

07:00.760 --> 07:02.310
More than you know.

07:04.171 --> 07:05.753
Come here.

07:18.576 --> 07:20.497
Klaus, we need to talk.

07:20.574 --> 07:21.952
No. No more talk.

07:22.029 --> 07:23.655
My daughter needs help.
I intend to get it for her.

07:23.732 --> 07:26.086
Please, Klaus,
I am not the enemy.

07:26.678 --> 07:27.926
Okay? Every time

07:28.003 --> 07:29.706
I look at Hope,
I see the child of mine

07:29.783 --> 07:32.797
that I never got to raise.
That's how I feel about her.

07:32.904 --> 07:35.008
That's how much
I want to protect her.

07:36.889 --> 07:40.070
She came to me
in so much pain,

07:40.302 --> 07:42.370
and I knew that she was
gonna take back that power

07:42.447 --> 07:43.749
with or without me.

07:44.631 --> 07:47.270
Okay? So,
I gambled

07:47.347 --> 07:49.898
that if she felt
like we were on her side,

07:49.975 --> 07:51.822
maybe
she would let us help her.

07:53.613 --> 07:55.703
Well, you couldn't
have been more wrong.

07:57.868 --> 08:00.390
Now Vincent will have to come up
with something.

08:00.802 --> 08:02.351
Already did.

08:05.037 --> 08:06.601
Hope's bracelet.

08:06.943 --> 08:09.465
She took it off for
good a few years ago.

08:09.542 --> 08:11.885
Said she didn't need it
anymore, but...

08:12.458 --> 08:13.913
now she does.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.542
Now, this won't stop whatever

08:16.619 --> 08:18.206
the dark magic is doing to her,

08:18.283 --> 08:20.389
but... it could lessen
her suffering

08:20.466 --> 08:22.546
until we find
a permanent solution.

08:29.012 --> 08:30.774
I know you love her.

08:31.450 --> 08:33.044
I never doubted that.

08:33.121 --> 08:35.686
- I just...
- Wish things were different?

08:36.981 --> 08:38.403
Me, too.

08:43.953 --> 08:45.792
You have a visitor.

08:49.841 --> 08:51.237
A voice mail?

08:53.847 --> 08:56.289
You tell me my girlfriend's dead
by voice mail?

08:56.366 --> 08:57.724
You can't even
return my calls.

08:57.801 --> 09:00.229
It all happened so fast.
What happened?

09:00.306 --> 09:01.716
How did she die?

09:03.081 --> 09:04.277
Car crash.

09:04.409 --> 09:05.573
The brakes went out.

09:05.650 --> 09:08.115
She died instantly.

09:08.370 --> 09:10.450
No pain, no suffering at all.

09:13.792 --> 09:15.383
Is Hope all right?

09:15.816 --> 09:17.107
She's coping.

09:17.253 --> 09:18.583
Can I see her?

09:20.027 --> 09:21.700
You know, n-now's...

09:21.777 --> 09:23.247
really not a good time.

09:23.324 --> 09:25.752
I'm sorry, Declan. How
do brakes just fail?

09:25.829 --> 09:27.529
I-It doesn't happen anymore.

09:27.683 --> 09:30.630
I don't know the details, okay?
As you can see,

09:30.761 --> 09:31.939
there was a storm.

09:32.016 --> 09:33.891
So, why was she out in it?
Where was she going?

09:33.968 --> 09:36.080
- I really don't know.
- And that doesn't bother you?

09:36.157 --> 09:37.197
That you don't have
answers?

09:37.274 --> 09:39.398
Because it's killing me
that I don't know what happened.

09:39.475 --> 09:41.202
- Declan, I...
- That I wasn't here

09:41.279 --> 09:44.443
to... to save her,
and that you...

09:45.230 --> 09:47.002
you had a funeral without me

09:47.079 --> 09:48.818
so I couldn't say good-bye.

09:53.354 --> 09:56.747
Something here...
It's not right, Freya.

09:58.847 --> 10:00.489
It just isn't.

10:08.392 --> 10:11.549
<i>♪ Now, now, now, now... ♪</i>

10:15.587 --> 10:17.136
Party's over.

10:17.352 --> 10:18.385
Emmett.

10:18.462 --> 10:21.042
You and your crew are no longer
welcome in New Orleans.

10:21.399 --> 10:23.518
Hardly for you to decide.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.976
You walked away from this city.

10:26.305 --> 10:28.063
Yeah, well, I didn't.

10:28.140 --> 10:30.635
And you don't get to banish
my friends from the Quarter.

10:30.712 --> 10:32.398
"Banishment" is your term.

10:32.475 --> 10:34.344
Mine is "law and order."

10:34.421 --> 10:36.765
Peace and harmony
among the species because

10:36.842 --> 10:38.687
everyone stays
where they belong.

10:38.764 --> 10:40.149
<i>♪ And you know we always... ♪</i>

10:42.517 --> 10:44.387
Those were your rules...

10:45.174 --> 10:46.549
remember?

10:46.743 --> 10:48.484
Oh, no,
don't compare yourself to me.

10:48.561 --> 10:51.600
I won't allow a bunch of dogs
and their half-breed cousins...

10:51.677 --> 10:53.081
Careful.

10:54.105 --> 10:56.274
You don't want
to finish that sentence.

10:58.666 --> 11:00.871
- Josh?
- Hmm?

11:01.190 --> 11:03.390
This place could use
a little more sunshine.

11:03.467 --> 11:04.918
Couldn't agree more.

11:07.303 --> 11:10.254
Enjoy the rest of your
day, Your Highness,

11:10.620 --> 11:13.545
but when the sun goes down,
we'll be in the Quarter.

11:14.886 --> 11:16.548
And if we see any werewolves,

11:16.625 --> 11:19.153
we'll be taking matters
into our own hands.

11:45.440 --> 11:48.496
If you're here to loot,
they already took the good stuff.

11:50.385 --> 11:52.082
Right at this very moment,

11:52.620 --> 11:54.629
I'll take quantity
over quality.

11:54.807 --> 11:57.197
It's bottom shelf.
Might burn a hole in your stomach.

11:57.274 --> 12:00.848
Try me.
I have an excellent constitution.

12:03.440 --> 12:05.298
Leveled by the storm,
I assume.

12:05.375 --> 12:09.582
Well, one might say
that I leveled myself.

12:11.440 --> 12:12.971
Dark days.

12:13.393 --> 12:14.744
Couldn't agree more.

12:14.821 --> 12:15.971
Do tell.

12:17.565 --> 12:19.692
That's not how this works.

12:20.166 --> 12:22.418
The man on your side of the
bar does all the talking.

12:22.495 --> 12:23.799
Please.

12:24.346 --> 12:26.222
You'd be doing me
a kindness.

12:26.698 --> 12:29.731
Perhaps hearing someone else's
pain might ease my own.

12:33.190 --> 12:34.713
I lost someone.

12:36.673 --> 12:37.962
A woman?

12:44.354 --> 12:46.337
How about you let me buy you
a couple of drinks?

12:46.414 --> 12:47.813
You tell me all about it.

12:48.471 --> 12:50.637
I happen to know
a thing or two...

12:51.089 --> 12:53.004
about love denied.

12:55.977 --> 12:57.361
It's Mardi Gras.

12:57.438 --> 13:00.204
Did they really think
they could break our spirits

13:00.281 --> 13:03.301
that easily, after everything
we've been through?

13:03.814 --> 13:07.465
The vampires can't scare us
out of our own city.

13:07.962 --> 13:11.097
So, grab a hammer, some nails.

13:11.174 --> 13:13.793
Let's get this float
on its right-side up.

13:13.963 --> 13:15.541
We will rebuild,

13:15.618 --> 13:20.410
and we will march tonight,
whether they like it or not.

13:21.213 --> 13:22.835
Let's go! Come on.

13:22.912 --> 13:24.096
Come on.

13:26.681 --> 13:28.517
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

13:28.594 --> 13:29.681
How's Hope?

13:29.758 --> 13:31.620
Um... struggling.

13:31.697 --> 13:33.431
- Hmm.
- Klaus is with her.

13:33.508 --> 13:34.918
How pissed is he?

13:35.064 --> 13:37.931
I'd say somewhere
to the left of berating

13:38.008 --> 13:40.926
and to the right
of plucking out hearts.

13:41.501 --> 13:44.571
I assume you got to...
get back to them?

13:44.648 --> 13:47.137
Mm. Are you still
getting on a plane?

13:48.221 --> 13:50.496
Tomorrow. Yes.

13:51.361 --> 13:55.379
Well, then,
I'm not going anywhere.

13:56.775 --> 13:58.487
If we only have one day,

13:58.564 --> 14:00.597
we're gonna make the best of it.

14:00.830 --> 14:02.197
Okay.

14:03.640 --> 14:06.017
Vampires and werewolves
have hated each other

14:06.094 --> 14:07.311
since the dawn of time.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.637
Now, just because some lunatic
decides that he wants

14:09.714 --> 14:11.930
to put that in writing
doesn't make it anything new.

14:12.234 --> 14:13.942
We're in the middle
of Mardi Gras.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.031
This is a sacred time.

14:15.108 --> 14:17.142
And why do you think
he's doing it right now?

14:17.615 --> 14:18.880
And if we
show them attention,

14:18.957 --> 14:20.811
then we're only
feeding the beast.

14:20.936 --> 14:22.778
So, what,
we turn a blind eye?

14:22.855 --> 14:25.267
No, no, no, no, no.
We stay smart.

14:25.548 --> 14:27.612
I mean, witches were
always used as the match

14:27.689 --> 14:29.750
that sets the whole
bonfire ablaze.

14:29.827 --> 14:34.446
Now, if we stay out of it,
maybe cooler heads will prevail.

14:36.741 --> 14:38.649
Or they won't.

14:39.094 --> 14:42.090
And when the nightwalkers are
done harassing the werewolves,

14:42.167 --> 14:43.908
they'll come after us.

14:45.762 --> 14:48.102
Look, we have
to pick a side, Vincent.

14:48.395 --> 14:50.414
There's no way around that.

14:59.817 --> 15:02.209
She's not entirely wrong.

15:11.699 --> 15:14.922
We simply want things restored
to the way they used to be,

15:14.999 --> 15:17.588
minus Marcel's boot
on your throats.

15:17.665 --> 15:19.442
We think it's a fair offer.

15:20.293 --> 15:22.685
Except I never said
I would negotiate with you

15:22.910 --> 15:24.116
about anything.

15:24.193 --> 15:26.491
You're a talented man, Vincent,

15:26.689 --> 15:28.780
a respected leader,
and I can tell

15:28.857 --> 15:31.775
you genuinely care
for your community.

15:31.852 --> 15:35.560
Working with us would be
a wise choice.

15:35.637 --> 15:36.893
Okay, Emmett,
you know what?

15:36.970 --> 15:39.007
That sounds to me
like it's a threat,

15:39.084 --> 15:40.486
and I don't like threats.

15:40.563 --> 15:43.522
I get it. Your life

15:43.667 --> 15:48.523
is much less important to you
than the welfare of your people.

15:49.380 --> 15:52.322
Your responsibility to them
is your greatest motivator.

15:52.399 --> 15:53.674
I'm gonna tell you what.

15:53.751 --> 15:56.697
If one of my witches
gets so much as a paper cut,

15:56.774 --> 15:59.038
I'm coming for you.
I'm gonna rain hellfire down

15:59.115 --> 16:00.689
on each and every single one
of you, so what you really

16:00.766 --> 16:02.494
need to do is go on and get
the hell on up out of here

16:02.571 --> 16:06.046
before I yank your punk ass out
into the sun, you heard me?

16:15.691 --> 16:17.546
Think about what I said.

16:17.719 --> 16:20.405
The offer's only
on the table for so long.

16:26.017 --> 16:28.593
Do you really think this
is gonna keep 'em away?

16:29.997 --> 16:32.223
No, but it'll keep
them above ground,

16:32.300 --> 16:34.393
and the next time Emmett
crawls out of the shadows,

16:34.470 --> 16:37.999
I will rip his face
off his thick skull.

16:40.163 --> 16:42.249
He did have a point,
you know.

16:43.534 --> 16:45.905
Werewolves quarantined
in the bayou,

16:45.982 --> 16:49.749
witches living in fear, vampires
at the top of the food chain.

16:49.954 --> 16:52.906
All right, go on.
Say what's really on your mind.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.851
These are rules
that you created.

16:56.286 --> 16:57.775
Rules that this community
was forced

16:57.852 --> 16:59.499
to live under for decades.

17:00.083 --> 17:01.671
All of this?

17:03.575 --> 17:05.452
It all started with you.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.083
I need you
to put this on.

17:29.708 --> 17:31.041
No, I don't need it.

17:31.118 --> 17:32.656
It's not a request, Hope.

17:32.733 --> 17:33.775
Dad, you said it.

17:33.852 --> 17:35.595
I'm strong.
I can control myself.

17:35.672 --> 17:37.049
No, you can't,
not with this.

17:37.126 --> 17:39.606
I lived with that darkness
for seven years.

17:39.785 --> 17:41.779
I know how awful
it can be.

17:41.948 --> 17:43.644
When I was in proximity
to my siblings,

17:43.721 --> 17:45.411
it was almost unbearable,
and now you...

17:45.702 --> 17:48.334
You're carrying all of it
inside you.

17:49.783 --> 17:52.001
Okay. If, um...
if I put that on,

17:52.078 --> 17:53.812
do you promise
to stop worrying?

17:53.932 --> 17:56.246
I'm your father.
I'm always gonna worry.

17:57.213 --> 17:58.596
Okay.

18:06.441 --> 18:08.919
There. Feel better?

18:09.401 --> 18:13.080
Or were you planning on hovering
over me until the end of time?

18:13.157 --> 18:15.403
Well, the end of time is
a bit extreme.

18:17.431 --> 18:18.942
Thanks, Dad.

19:17.226 --> 19:19.509
Stop... please stop!

19:40.473 --> 19:41.784
When I was in Dublin,

19:41.861 --> 19:43.748
I got her grandmother's
wedding ring,

19:44.182 --> 19:46.022
so I could ask
her to marry me.

19:47.258 --> 19:48.951
Did she know?

19:49.942 --> 19:50.962
Ah, who am I kidding?

19:51.039 --> 19:52.954
She probably would have
turned me down.

19:53.774 --> 19:56.350
I was batting way out
of my league, and...

19:56.953 --> 19:58.850
and she had a hell of a past.

19:59.208 --> 20:00.397
What do you mean?

20:00.666 --> 20:02.332
Ah, an ex.

20:03.495 --> 20:05.490
He really did a
number on her.

20:05.567 --> 20:09.102
I could tell she still
held a candle for the guy.

20:10.506 --> 20:12.112
But when you...

20:13.446 --> 20:15.448
you find a woman that...

20:16.211 --> 20:18.935
Her smile could end wars,
and...

20:19.469 --> 20:22.136
she has a heart as
big as Ireland...

20:25.346 --> 20:27.802
you'd have to be a fool
to let her go.

20:31.965 --> 20:33.472
You all right?

20:38.470 --> 20:40.542
A smile to end a war.

20:45.246 --> 20:47.430
So now you see her face
everywhere you go,

20:47.507 --> 20:49.251
you hear her voice
in your dreams,

20:49.328 --> 20:53.183
and you feel the lingering ghost
of her touch.

20:57.270 --> 20:59.269
You feel responsible.

21:00.464 --> 21:03.852
Perhaps if you had known more,
you could have done...

21:06.187 --> 21:07.712
something.

21:18.912 --> 21:20.706
You're him, aren't you?

21:25.220 --> 21:27.183
The one that broke her heart.

21:41.657 --> 21:44.770
Ivy, there are hateful people
and then there's psychopaths.

21:45.072 --> 21:47.251
Emmett strikes me
as the latter.

21:47.642 --> 21:49.079
That might be true.

21:49.156 --> 21:52.652
But no matter what the night
may hold, just remember that

21:52.782 --> 21:56.777
dawn is always right
around the corner.

21:58.276 --> 22:01.636
You always manage to find
the light in the darkness, huh?

22:02.697 --> 22:05.159
There's always
beauty to be seen.

22:05.431 --> 22:08.644
You just have to focus on
what's right in front of you.

22:09.454 --> 22:11.144
I'm focused.

22:15.065 --> 22:16.933
The lightness suits you.

22:41.220 --> 22:42.779
You're not wearing
your bracelet.

22:42.856 --> 22:45.597
I need, uh, two
drams of absinthe.

22:45.826 --> 22:47.251
You're 15.

22:47.510 --> 22:49.453
It's for a spell.

22:49.530 --> 22:50.742
What kind of spell?

22:51.150 --> 22:52.656
The bracelet's not working, Dad.

22:52.733 --> 22:54.123
- It's not enough.
- Well, then we'll find

22:54.200 --> 22:55.956
something that does work.

23:01.330 --> 23:02.595
Hope...

23:05.524 --> 23:07.224
This is not your responsibility.

23:07.301 --> 23:09.479
It's my mess.
I'll clean it up.

23:10.617 --> 23:12.049
Why'd you come here?

23:12.844 --> 23:14.059
Regret.

23:14.297 --> 23:16.359
I lost so many years
with her, and I...

23:17.680 --> 23:20.096
I wanted to know about her life
without me.

23:20.813 --> 23:24.065
So you're here to mine my pain
for your absolution?

23:25.113 --> 23:28.002
Do you have any understanding
of the damage you caused her?

23:31.954 --> 23:34.151
Her brakes didn't fail,
did they?

23:34.790 --> 23:35.782
No.

23:35.859 --> 23:37.862
There was no car
accident at all.

23:39.869 --> 23:41.737
But you know what happened.

23:43.320 --> 23:44.493
Tell me.

23:44.570 --> 23:46.106
- Tell me how she died.
- You don't want to know.

23:46.183 --> 23:47.220
I have to know.

23:47.297 --> 23:50.098
Declan, hey,
I need a favor from the bar.

23:51.958 --> 23:53.510
What are you doing here?

24:01.609 --> 24:04.455
I remember when we weren't
allowed in the Quarter.

24:05.086 --> 24:08.736
But before that, I remember
the parades we would have.

24:08.902 --> 24:10.384
When I was six,

24:10.461 --> 24:13.138
my mama was
the Queen of Mardi Gras.

24:13.215 --> 24:15.990
I got to sit with
her on the float,

24:16.067 --> 24:17.870
watch her
throw beads.

24:18.072 --> 24:19.994
People having their
hands in the air

24:20.071 --> 24:21.857
for something touched
by their queen.

24:21.934 --> 24:23.718
Aw, you must have been
so proud.

24:23.807 --> 24:25.243
I was.

24:25.851 --> 24:28.176
I thought about that day
a lot when I was...

24:28.253 --> 24:30.120
stuck in the bayou

24:30.246 --> 24:32.115
and what it
meant to have had

24:32.192 --> 24:34.901
a werewolf queen
on Bourbon Street.

24:42.204 --> 24:43.901
You know, I'm good here.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.853
If you could help Freya
with the hats?

24:45.930 --> 24:48.854
Oh, she's fine.
She's-she's got Ivy helping her.

24:49.696 --> 24:51.714
You've got one day
with your girl.

24:51.868 --> 24:53.591
Stop listening to me
yammer about the past

24:53.668 --> 24:55.089
and get over there.

25:00.727 --> 25:02.198
Are-are you Lisina?

25:02.275 --> 25:03.446
I'm sorry.

25:03.930 --> 25:05.729
They told me I had to do this.

25:05.903 --> 25:07.196
Lisina!

25:27.445 --> 25:30.979
Keelin. Keelin.
Open your eyes.

25:32.024 --> 25:33.058
Keelin.

25:33.156 --> 25:35.978
Wake up. Please.

25:36.055 --> 25:37.571
Please wake up.

25:39.211 --> 25:41.585
Hey. Hey.

25:41.662 --> 25:42.683
Hey.

25:43.054 --> 25:44.447
What happened?

25:44.899 --> 25:45.992
A bomb.

25:46.176 --> 25:48.455
A nightwalker
compelled a human.

25:50.196 --> 25:51.908
Where's Lisina?

25:53.796 --> 25:55.557
Where is she?

26:24.511 --> 26:25.569
Ivy!

26:25.652 --> 26:27.050
Ivy!

26:28.402 --> 26:29.425
Ivy!

26:29.502 --> 26:30.982
I'm here, Vincent.

26:37.638 --> 26:39.304
It-It's not my blood.

26:40.409 --> 26:42.851
Oh, my God.

26:52.967 --> 26:54.250
Killing my mom
wasn't enough?

26:54.327 --> 26:55.653
- Now you've come for Declan?
- That's not

26:55.730 --> 26:56.734
what I'm here for.
He killed her.

26:56.811 --> 26:58.154
That's not
what happened.

26:58.231 --> 26:59.346
No, but if you weren't there,

26:59.423 --> 27:01.056
she'd still be alive.

27:03.265 --> 27:04.270
Stop!

27:04.347 --> 27:05.656
- Wh-What's going on with you?
- God, stop!

27:05.733 --> 27:07.397
- Stop! Shut up! Shut up!
- What did you do?

27:07.474 --> 27:09.189
Hey, don't hurt him!

27:10.415 --> 27:11.858
I won't.

27:13.507 --> 27:15.728
We can't do this
in front of him.

27:16.209 --> 27:17.978
Okay, fine.

27:26.531 --> 27:28.368
Now it's just the two of us.

27:39.295 --> 27:41.173
Three innocent people...

27:42.385 --> 27:43.624
gone.

27:48.201 --> 27:51.267
I used to think that what
I was doing was for the best.

27:51.568 --> 27:54.272
The werewolves were dangerous,
the witches unpredictable,

27:54.349 --> 27:57.872
and the vampires, well,
they were my people.

27:59.366 --> 28:00.772
And every day
that New Orleans

28:00.849 --> 28:03.834
didn't fall apart was proof
that I was right.

28:09.671 --> 28:12.876
But these people want violence
for the sake of it,

28:13.062 --> 28:16.329
and I'll be damned if I let them
use my name to do that.

28:25.866 --> 28:27.423
My memory was gone.

28:27.788 --> 28:29.556
I didn't know who she was.

28:29.663 --> 28:31.384
Well, now you do.

28:31.749 --> 28:33.243
How does it feel?

28:33.615 --> 28:35.673
Like the worst pain
I've ever experienced.

28:40.859 --> 28:41.930
I hate you.

28:42.007 --> 28:43.392
I hate me, too.

28:43.639 --> 28:45.595
You let her die.

29:08.461 --> 29:09.767
Hope.

29:29.430 --> 29:31.290
What the
hell was that?

29:57.032 --> 30:00.175
It took a lot of courage for
all of you to come out here tonight,

30:00.374 --> 30:02.763
especially those of you
in the werewolf community.

30:02.840 --> 30:05.385
It's times like these
that either strengthen

30:05.462 --> 30:07.276
or break our bonds.

30:08.921 --> 30:10.807
Tonight, we stand
with you.

30:11.227 --> 30:14.213
We march together
to honor Lisina.

30:14.290 --> 30:16.470
Her legacy, her strength,

30:16.547 --> 30:18.534
and her fighting spirit.

30:18.929 --> 30:20.534
And whatever happens,

30:20.867 --> 30:23.448
we will not back down.

30:23.698 --> 30:25.048
Yeah!

30:31.555 --> 30:33.682
You're joining the march
through the Quarter?

30:33.790 --> 30:35.807
Werewolves deserve
our support.

30:35.884 --> 30:37.883
Ivy, and it's like
what you said to me:

30:37.960 --> 30:39.265
I have to choose a side.

30:39.342 --> 30:40.513
They're gonna attack.

30:40.590 --> 30:42.430
Then we're gonna be ready
for 'em.

30:46.748 --> 30:49.461
I'm headed to the City of the
Dead to pray for the injured.

30:49.568 --> 30:51.239
Well, Ivy, I
tell you what,

30:51.316 --> 30:53.143
if you got a couple prayers
just laying around,

30:53.220 --> 30:55.114
feel free to send
them my way, okay?

30:57.865 --> 30:59.867
You're a good man, Vincent.

31:09.053 --> 31:10.151
Be careful.

31:11.256 --> 31:12.560
Yeah.

31:12.701 --> 31:14.898
I'm gonna see you
on the other side of this, okay?

31:16.803 --> 31:18.352
I'm counting on it.

31:18.908 --> 31:19.996
Yeah.

31:20.885 --> 31:22.232
All right.

31:37.658 --> 31:39.254
I want to march.

31:41.080 --> 31:43.543
You almost got killed today.

31:44.783 --> 31:46.465
But I didn't.

31:46.971 --> 31:48.848
You need to stay here
and rest.

31:49.017 --> 31:51.254
Hey, who's the doctor here?

31:54.799 --> 31:56.027
Marry me.

31:56.104 --> 31:57.129
Oh, what?

31:57.221 --> 31:58.871
Uh! I'm serious.

32:00.283 --> 32:02.227
Is this because
I almost died today?

32:02.304 --> 32:03.308
No.

32:03.385 --> 32:07.020
Well, yes, but no.

32:08.455 --> 32:12.175
Um, two years ago,

32:12.252 --> 32:14.895
I started planning
how I was going to say it.

32:15.005 --> 32:20.184
Um, what that moment would
look like.

32:20.493 --> 32:23.348
I was just
waiting for the right time,

32:23.682 --> 32:26.619
but the right time
never came.

32:26.696 --> 32:28.827
And then, finally, today,

32:28.904 --> 32:30.246
it dawned on me that

32:30.323 --> 32:32.410
there's never
a perfect time.

32:32.768 --> 32:35.004
There's just right now.

32:36.166 --> 32:37.660
And right now,

32:38.774 --> 32:41.347
I don't want to spend
another second without you.

32:45.470 --> 32:47.391
No more reuniting
at funerals.

32:47.468 --> 32:51.151
No more astral projections
from the Middle East.

32:51.228 --> 32:53.860
No more choosing between
you and my family,

32:53.937 --> 32:57.402
because you are
my family, Keelin.

32:57.603 --> 32:59.487
You're everything to me.

33:01.038 --> 33:06.081
So, please, marry me.

33:06.579 --> 33:07.845
Yes.

33:15.634 --> 33:17.048
O-O-Ouch.

33:17.195 --> 33:18.703
Oh, I'm sorry.
Your ribs.

33:18.780 --> 33:21.858
It's perfect.
Everything's perfect.

33:22.706 --> 33:24.480
I love you. I love you so much.

33:24.557 --> 33:25.918
So much.

33:35.792 --> 33:37.286
Drink this.

33:39.010 --> 33:40.787
What are you people?

33:45.760 --> 33:47.426
We're vampires.

33:48.690 --> 33:50.151
Witches.

33:51.948 --> 33:53.481
Other things.

33:54.479 --> 33:56.270
But those are just...

33:56.487 --> 33:58.494
stories for the tourists,
aren't they?

33:58.571 --> 34:00.450
You saw
what you saw.

34:02.292 --> 34:03.768
So everyone in this town,

34:03.845 --> 34:05.880
my friends, they're all... - No.

34:06.183 --> 34:08.121
Some. Not all.

34:10.630 --> 34:12.408
What about Hayley?

34:13.971 --> 34:15.705
Hayley, too.

34:20.783 --> 34:23.716
And, uh,
Hope?

34:24.056 --> 34:25.463
I think you're gonna
need something

34:25.540 --> 34:27.231
a little stronger
than that water.

34:27.822 --> 34:29.942
As if I didn't already.

34:31.635 --> 34:33.081
Um...

34:35.556 --> 34:37.841
So I've-I've been a fool.

34:38.245 --> 34:40.882
An idiot in
the-the dark about...

34:41.670 --> 34:42.820
Hayley and me.

34:42.897 --> 34:44.150
She...

34:44.463 --> 34:48.466
She lied
about... everything.

34:48.659 --> 34:51.911
No, she cared for you
very deeply, my friend.

34:53.065 --> 34:55.341
That much
I'm quite certain of.

34:57.823 --> 35:00.069
Which is why I know
she'd want me to do this.

35:00.322 --> 35:01.966
What are you doing?

35:03.175 --> 35:05.278
You will forget
meeting me here today.

35:05.386 --> 35:08.385
Any questions you have about
Hayley's life or death

35:08.462 --> 35:10.028
will no longer plague you.

35:10.245 --> 35:14.122
You will remember only
her love for you

35:14.667 --> 35:16.955
and the joy and happiness
that you brought to her.

35:17.032 --> 35:19.325
And you will know,
without question,

35:19.761 --> 35:23.216
that Hayley Marshall
is now at peace.

35:25.023 --> 35:29.622
And with that,
you'll be at peace yourself.

35:47.590 --> 35:48.598
What was that?

35:48.675 --> 35:51.124
You won't take my help,
you reject the bracelet,

35:51.201 --> 35:52.540
you're throwing
Elijah around.

35:52.617 --> 35:54.531
It stopped the voices.

35:54.871 --> 35:55.886
What?

35:56.093 --> 35:59.109
Ever since I took the power
back, the whispers...

35:59.186 --> 36:02.880
I can't think, I can't sleep,
I can't even breathe.

36:03.825 --> 36:06.255
But right now, it's silent.

36:08.715 --> 36:10.666
Is this the rest of my life?

36:10.809 --> 36:13.779
A rage that can only be quieted
by violence?

36:16.230 --> 36:19.669
Hope, if violence is what
you need to feel better,

36:21.040 --> 36:23.701
then you have
the perfect father.

36:27.461 --> 36:29.765
And I don't want
a single one of y'all to forget

36:29.842 --> 36:31.505
that these are our streets.

36:32.292 --> 36:34.267
They belong to each
and every single one of us,

36:34.344 --> 36:36.211
and each and every
single one of us are welcome.

36:36.288 --> 36:38.297
No matter what they say...

36:41.721 --> 36:43.935
and no matter what they do.

36:46.108 --> 36:48.044
These are our streets.

37:03.134 --> 37:05.283
So this is where it ends.

37:05.360 --> 37:07.107
Apparently so.

37:30.240 --> 37:32.156
I thought I could handle it.

37:32.233 --> 37:33.781
I really did.

37:34.459 --> 37:36.526
You're handling it
as best you can,

37:36.603 --> 37:40.609
and I'm gonna be here with you
every step of the way.

37:43.619 --> 37:45.953
Will you stay
with me awhile?

37:46.624 --> 37:48.750
Of course I will.

38:01.672 --> 38:05.853
Guérir blese a.
Guérir blese a.

38:06.100 --> 38:10.282
Guérir blese a.
Guérir blese a.

38:10.359 --> 38:11.848
Come on now, Emmett,
you didn't think

38:11.925 --> 38:13.814
I wasn't gonna show up,
now, did you?

38:13.906 --> 38:15.650
So, let me get this straight.

38:15.914 --> 38:18.717
Our solution, everyone in
their corners, separate,

38:18.794 --> 38:20.889
was good enough
when hedemanded it,

38:20.966 --> 38:24.244
but somehow I'm hateful
for proposing the same?

38:24.398 --> 38:26.939
No less hateful
when it was his idea.

38:28.642 --> 38:30.205
That's right.

38:33.680 --> 38:35.455
Marcel can't die,

38:35.689 --> 38:37.098
but you can.

38:37.175 --> 38:40.580
Are the werewolves
really worth dying for?

38:43.140 --> 38:44.936
You're damn right.

39:00.492 --> 39:01.544
Did you do that?

39:01.621 --> 39:03.679
No. Astral projection.

39:03.756 --> 39:05.299
They must have a witch.

39:06.266 --> 39:07.956
Poor Vincent.

39:08.602 --> 39:10.041
You picked a side,

39:10.476 --> 39:11.911
and in doing so, betrayed

39:11.988 --> 39:14.276
the witches and
your sweet Ivy.

39:14.524 --> 39:17.338
You should've taken
me up on my offer.

39:20.989 --> 39:23.158
So what, did he just
come here to bluff?

39:24.031 --> 39:25.737
I think he wanted to sh...

39:25.821 --> 39:28.158
He wanted to find out what
side I was gonna choose.

39:30.914 --> 39:33.479
And he wanted to punish
me if I chose wrong.

39:37.647 --> 39:39.901
Guérir blese a.

39:40.028 --> 39:42.444
Guérir
blese a.

39:42.521 --> 39:44.940
Guérir blese a.

39:45.477 --> 39:48.244
Pour la santé ad salutem.
