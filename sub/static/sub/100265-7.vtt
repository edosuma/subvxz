WEBVTT

00:31.114 --> 00:31.948
Hey!

00:32.323 --> 00:34.200
Might be a better artist than me now.

00:35.201 --> 00:36.661
Don't let it go to your head.

00:36.745 --> 00:38.204
It's not saying much.

00:40.832 --> 00:42.083
That's supposed to be us.

00:43.585 --> 00:45.670
From now on, how about we stick together?

00:47.047 --> 00:47.881
No matter what.

00:54.763 --> 00:56.389
This is where we are now

00:57.599 --> 00:59.934
and this is the <i>Resolute.</i>

01:00.018 --> 01:02.270
You've been there before, twice,

01:02.353 --> 01:05.315
and neither time was that great, but--
Roll with me here.

01:07.442 --> 01:09.027
This is Alpha Centauri.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.112
I've told you all about it.

01:11.654 --> 01:12.614
It's our new home,

01:13.740 --> 01:16.367
and the only way of getting there is you.

01:17.619 --> 01:19.037
I think we'll like it there.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.872
I mean, I think we will.

01:20.955 --> 01:22.874
Thank you. If you hadn't killed SAR,

01:22.957 --> 01:25.126
the robot would still be trapped
down there.

01:27.212 --> 01:28.046
Trust me.

01:28.129 --> 01:29.130
It's going to work.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.682
<i>It'll be the first robot</i>
<i>we've found in one piece.</i>

01:40.058 --> 01:42.227
It'll be fully functional
and more capable.

01:42.310 --> 01:45.855
Testing in three, two, one.

01:49.776 --> 01:50.693
Careful now.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.571
You don't want to damage the thing.

01:54.030 --> 01:55.240
That's our ticket home.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.325
I need to be prepared.

01:59.828 --> 02:02.247
We'll be waiting for you
at the extraction point.

02:02.455 --> 02:05.917
All you have to do is get them inside
and we'll take care of the rest.

02:23.935 --> 02:25.061
How's it feel?

02:25.436 --> 02:26.938
Uh, it tingles.

02:27.021 --> 02:29.399
Good.
It means the fibroblasts are activating.

02:29.482 --> 02:31.651
-Gross.
-No, it's good. It means it's working.

02:31.734 --> 02:32.861
Still gross.

02:33.486 --> 02:34.571
Okay.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.823
-Oh, slow, slow, slow, slow.

02:36.906 --> 02:38.533
It's good to be back together again, huh?

02:39.117 --> 02:40.160
-Come here.
-Yeah.

02:40.952 --> 02:42.370
Glad you're safe, kiddo.

02:42.453 --> 02:44.330
-You too, Dad.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.541
-Oh, this hug must really hurt, huh?

02:46.624 --> 02:47.959
Yeah. It hurts.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.714
So, I saw Dr. Smith being treated earlier.

02:52.797 --> 02:54.424
Which is strange because

02:55.049 --> 02:56.467
she wasn't being arrested.

02:56.759 --> 02:59.262
Yeah, I think she's turning over
a new leaf.

02:59.345 --> 03:01.514
Well, she can turn over
as many new leafs as she wants,

03:01.598 --> 03:03.099
but the tree's still rotten.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.435
She saved Mr. Jackson's life
like a real doctor.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.729
We got bigger problems than Dr. Smith.

03:07.812 --> 03:08.980
Uh, hey! Where are you going?

03:10.064 --> 03:12.692
I was sent down to that planet
to do a job,

03:14.152 --> 03:15.486
and that job's not done.

03:20.283 --> 03:21.701
Permission to come aboard.

03:21.826 --> 03:22.994
Permission granted.

03:26.623 --> 03:29.876
John Robinson. I'm surprised
to see you on your feet so soon.

03:29.959 --> 03:31.336
I get that a lot.

03:33.129 --> 03:36.382
So, uh, I wanted to check where we stand
with the water supply.

03:36.466 --> 03:39.969
It's not ideal, but we did manage to bank
over 200 thousand gallons

03:40.053 --> 03:42.597
from wells one and two before
we became aware it was contaminated.

03:42.680 --> 03:43.598
Where is it?

03:43.681 --> 03:46.517
We have it safely stored in bladders
so there's no risk to the ship.

03:46.601 --> 03:49.103
What happens now?
How do we clean it up so we can leave?

03:49.187 --> 03:51.189
Our scientists devised a process.

03:52.023 --> 03:52.941
It's painstaking.

03:53.024 --> 03:56.277
-I'm told it will take roughly 53 weeks.
-A year?

03:57.028 --> 04:00.406
Longer than we had hoped,
but we'll manage.

04:03.326 --> 04:06.037
That's not the only reason
you came to speak to me, is it?

04:06.120 --> 04:07.705
Well, now that you mention it--

04:07.789 --> 04:09.791
The incident with your daughter,

04:10.625 --> 04:12.502
it was difficult for all of us,

04:12.627 --> 04:15.672
but my duty is to do what's best
for everyone on this ship.

04:15.755 --> 04:17.882
You're a soldier,
you understand the situation I was in.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.133
But I'm also a father,

04:20.218 --> 04:24.681
so the next time you make a decision
that affects the lives of my family,

04:26.015 --> 04:27.517
you better make me a part of it.

04:28.476 --> 04:31.312
Captain, comms have picked up something.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.231
-What is it?
-You'll wanna hear this.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.454
Clear the bridge. Get me Hastings.

04:49.414 --> 04:50.248
What's going on?

04:50.331 --> 04:52.166
We will have to continue this later.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.585
Escort Mr. Robinson off the bridge.

05:03.011 --> 05:05.013
Whoa! It's okay. Don't worry.

05:06.222 --> 05:07.098
It's okay.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.100
Gypsy's a friend.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.230
I think you two got off
on the wrong foot.

05:15.231 --> 05:16.691
This is a horse.

05:17.275 --> 05:18.818
He's a domesticated animal.

05:18.901 --> 05:22.405
Before we had things like chariots,
we used them for transportation.

05:22.864 --> 05:26.075
This is how we calm them down
when they're nervous or upset.

05:28.703 --> 05:29.746
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:29.829 --> 05:30.788
It's okay,

05:30.872 --> 05:32.582
this is called a bit.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.043
We put one in so he doesn't run away.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.545
All right.

05:43.634 --> 05:46.054
Friend Will Robinson.

05:46.137 --> 05:47.513
Yeah. He's a friend.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.724
It's just to make sure
we keep him under control.

05:52.226 --> 05:53.144
It doesn't hurt.

05:53.853 --> 05:54.896
I promise you.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.570
See? He likes to be ridden.

06:03.154 --> 06:04.030
Come on.

06:22.548 --> 06:24.092
I can't tell what its reaction is.

06:24.675 --> 06:25.968
I imagine it's positive.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.513
That thing was hunting my son.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.766
Wanted him so badly
it threw the robot in a pit for 7 months

06:31.849 --> 06:34.060
in the distant chance
that it would lure Will down here.

06:34.143 --> 06:36.604
But why do you suppose
that thing was so interested in your son?

06:37.230 --> 06:38.147
I don't know.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.483
Maybe because what they have is special.

06:41.818 --> 06:44.028
Special things are often
considered a threat.

06:46.030 --> 06:47.156
We should get going.

07:02.547 --> 07:05.341
Guess you could say I've been
sentenced a little mandatory Me Time.

07:08.094 --> 07:08.928
Agh!

07:11.222 --> 07:13.474
Oh, in case you're wondering,
it really hurts.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.184
-I'm really sorry about all this.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.103
The truth is, I owed Penny one, so--

07:17.854 --> 07:19.856
-About that.
- No, no, no. Say no more.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.816
Kid's got a bright future.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.693
Plus, I wanna be written about
in the sequel.

07:23.776 --> 07:26.195
Good, because I'm gonna need
your help again.

07:26.279 --> 07:29.991
The <i>Resolute </i>received an audio signal
this morning, and ever since then,

07:30.074 --> 07:32.368
Kamal and Hastings have been holed up
in the bridge

07:32.452 --> 07:34.871
and they put a freeze on
all the transports from the planet.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.582
That probably just has something
to do with the whole rust business.

07:37.665 --> 07:39.417
I don't think so.
The shuttles were running

07:39.500 --> 07:41.502
right up until the audio signal came in.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.129
Something's not right.

07:43.629 --> 07:44.589
Kamal's face.

07:44.672 --> 07:47.008
-It was like she'd seen a ghost.
-Heard a ghost, technically.

07:47.675 --> 07:49.802
-Every signal that gets picked up by RTS

07:49.886 --> 07:52.096
-is backed up in the server room.
-Recordings?

07:52.180 --> 07:54.390
But the only people that have access
to the server room

07:54.474 --> 07:56.684
are people with the highest
clearance level.

07:57.101 --> 07:59.312
A clearance level that you, my friend,

07:59.395 --> 08:00.313
do not have.

08:00.396 --> 08:03.566
But if anyone could bypass that clearance,
it's Don West, right?

08:03.649 --> 08:04.859
Normally, yes.

08:04.942 --> 08:07.320
But right now,
I can't even bypass my room.

08:07.987 --> 08:08.905
So you're screwed.

08:11.449 --> 08:13.493
<i>I'm afraid</i>
<i>I just can't help you, John.</i>

08:13.576 --> 08:15.912
You're talking about breaking
and entering.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.121
I'm a doctor.

08:17.205 --> 08:19.123
I have a reputation to preserve.

08:19.207 --> 08:21.501
How about we start
by being straight with each other.

08:21.584 --> 08:22.543
I'd love that.

08:22.627 --> 08:25.046
Seems that you've managed
to stay out of trouble

08:25.129 --> 08:27.089
by always being one step ahead.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.716
Two steps, actually.

08:28.799 --> 08:30.176
Yeah, well, you're behind now.

08:30.259 --> 08:32.261
We all are. By a lot.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.639
Doesn't that make you feel uncomfortable?

08:34.722 --> 08:36.599
Well, I have my own office.

08:36.682 --> 08:38.476
Do I look uncomfortable to you?

08:38.559 --> 08:41.979
How about when Captain Kamal
almost blew you out into space

08:42.063 --> 08:43.105
to save her ship.

08:43.189 --> 08:44.774
-Were you comfortable then?
-Oh.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.359
So, I see.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.779
This is really about helping me,

08:50.029 --> 08:50.863
not you.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.367
It's a classic soft-in.

08:54.450 --> 08:55.535
One of my favorites.

08:55.618 --> 08:56.494
Well played.

08:56.577 --> 08:58.538
I am not playing anyone.

08:58.621 --> 09:01.999
I am trying to keep my family safe.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.585
Let's say I were to help you,

09:04.669 --> 09:05.836
what would that entail?

09:07.922 --> 09:12.385
I need to get into a place
only a few people have access to.

09:14.345 --> 09:15.805
And what makes you think that I can--

09:15.888 --> 09:18.558
Because everyone here believes
that you're Dr. Smith,

09:19.350 --> 09:21.852
which means that you have managed
to move around

09:22.103 --> 09:23.104
undetected,

09:23.479 --> 09:26.566
avoid security, alter digital records.

09:26.649 --> 09:30.736
As far as I can tell, if anyone can access
the inaccessible, it's you.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.196
I don't know.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.240
Sounds risky.

09:37.118 --> 09:41.247
Do you honestly believe that
I would come to you of all people

09:41.831 --> 09:45.501
if I didn't feel that
this was absolutely necessary?

09:45.876 --> 09:46.836
No.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.754
I honestly don't.

09:50.298 --> 09:52.550
Fine.

09:54.343 --> 09:58.306
But if I'm sticking my neck out like this,
you and your family are gonna owe me.

09:59.724 --> 10:00.808
Big time.

10:17.575 --> 10:18.909
Adler, do you know what those are?

10:18.993 --> 10:20.953
Haven't come across them before.

10:21.037 --> 10:24.415
I thought you said you had seen everything
this planet has to offer.

10:25.666 --> 10:27.293
Well, we can't ride through them.

10:27.376 --> 10:28.878
We're gonna have to ride around.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.634
Let's see if we can find
an alternate route.

10:41.432 --> 10:42.516
Hey.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.601
That's pretty good.

10:44.644 --> 10:45.978
You want to learn how to feed him?

10:47.313 --> 10:49.065
Here, let me get something for you.

10:52.193 --> 10:53.903
You want a slice of apple, Gypsy?

10:54.779 --> 10:55.905
Here you go.

10:57.406 --> 10:58.282
Go on.

10:58.616 --> 10:59.492
Like this.

11:14.423 --> 11:15.591
That's enough for now.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.134
You don't want overfeed him.

11:38.823 --> 11:39.657
There.

11:39.740 --> 11:42.326
There's a way to the pickup spot,
just to the south.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.161
Where that canyon narrows.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.373
I don't know how you got so good
at all this.

11:47.456 --> 11:48.999
I didn't grow up in the city.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.842
My son has a scar like that.

11:58.592 --> 12:00.219
Oh.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.762
You saw that.

12:02.179 --> 12:03.013
Sorry.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.309
I know you think that

12:07.435 --> 12:10.271
what Will and this Robot have is special.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.356
I thought I had it too...

12:14.024 --> 12:15.151
with Scarecrow,

12:16.235 --> 12:17.445
but it was a lie.

12:20.364 --> 12:21.323
There is some...

12:21.991 --> 12:23.659
base programming in these things,

12:25.745 --> 12:27.538
all intelligences have it.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.958
The primal, lizard part of our brains,

12:31.041 --> 12:33.419
in humans, it's tied to survival.

12:33.544 --> 12:37.006
If we're threatened, we run
or we fight for our lives.

12:37.757 --> 12:41.510
And we have kids,
so that life can continue after we die.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.429
These things aren't alive.

12:44.221 --> 12:45.931
They don't know what life is.

12:47.641 --> 12:48.601
They're killers.

12:50.060 --> 12:54.106
If you strip away all the...
paintings and the high-fives,

12:54.815 --> 12:56.275
that's all you're left with.

13:09.747 --> 13:10.831
What are you doing?

13:14.376 --> 13:15.753
Friend.

13:17.129 --> 13:17.963
Look,

13:18.589 --> 13:20.424
I know you think you're helping him,

13:20.508 --> 13:22.009
but he needs his bit.

13:22.092 --> 13:23.677
He doesn't know any better.

13:24.053 --> 13:26.180
Without it, he'd just wander off.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.059
Hey.

13:32.019 --> 13:33.646
What happened to the horse's bridle?

13:33.729 --> 13:35.272
It was the robot.

13:36.315 --> 13:38.067
What? Why would it do that?

13:38.150 --> 13:39.568
He just doesn't understand.

13:40.694 --> 13:43.823
Okay, Will, I think a lot of people
wouldn't understand.

13:44.323 --> 13:47.451
- You ready to go?
-Yeah. You're gonna have to neck rein.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.787
And mind your seat,
you won't have his mouth.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.122
He'll be harder to control.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.504
<i>Dr. Zoe Smith.</i>

13:58.879 --> 14:00.881
<i>Security access granted.</i>

14:00.965 --> 14:02.550
Seriously? That's it?

14:02.633 --> 14:05.219
All that, "You're gonna owe me stuff"
and all you have to do

14:05.302 --> 14:06.929
is wave your arm in front of a sensor?

14:08.347 --> 14:10.724
You didn't think the only thing
I upgraded was my name,

14:10.808 --> 14:12.810
-did you?
-Unbelievable.

14:13.143 --> 14:15.145
Thank you. And you're welcome.

14:15.646 --> 14:17.231
And you still owe me.

14:34.623 --> 14:35.499
It's a...

14:36.125 --> 14:38.085
a lot of customers you still owe.

14:38.419 --> 14:39.962
Former customers,

14:40.337 --> 14:42.840
now it's just a list of people
I have to hide from.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.594
- Even though you saved my sister?

14:46.677 --> 14:49.013
Former customers don't really care
about that.

14:49.263 --> 14:50.139
You know,

14:50.514 --> 14:52.391
once we get to Alpha Centauri,

14:52.975 --> 14:56.145
everyone will hear about your heroism
and all will be forgiven.

14:56.228 --> 14:58.814
Is that how it works? Yeah. Maybe.

14:59.523 --> 15:00.482
If we get there.

15:00.566 --> 15:04.403
Well, my mom and Will are coming back
with the robot, so we're gonna get there.

15:04.528 --> 15:06.906
You might want to share
some of that optimism with your dad.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.408
-What do you mean?
-You know,

15:09.491 --> 15:11.827
the whole thing on the bridge.
What they heard, and--

15:14.121 --> 15:15.247
He didn't tell you that?

15:15.331 --> 15:16.373
Tell me what?

15:16.457 --> 15:18.083
Oh...

15:18.167 --> 15:21.211
you know, it might be
a father-daughter type conversation.

15:21.295 --> 15:22.963
-Don.
-Honestly, I don't know what it is,

15:23.047 --> 15:24.924
but it concerned your father enough
to go to Smith for help.

15:25.007 --> 15:26.133
Smith?

15:26.216 --> 15:28.260
-Clearly he didn't tell you that either.
-Smith?

15:28.344 --> 15:30.804
Saying her name three times
is not gonna make her disappear.

15:30.888 --> 15:32.890
What could he possibly need
from someone like Smith?

15:32.973 --> 15:36.018
Look, you didn't hear it from me,
but I know where they're going.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.735
- Do you trust him?
-Adler?

15:46.654 --> 15:49.365
Sometimes you gotta work with people
that you don't trust.

15:49.448 --> 15:50.658
You just gotta be smart.

15:50.950 --> 15:51.909
I don't know.

15:52.451 --> 15:53.577
He's pretty smart too.

15:54.161 --> 15:56.622
He built something strong enough
to kill SAR

15:56.705 --> 15:59.041
but he didn't know
we were walking into a trap.

15:59.124 --> 16:00.834
He didn't know we were in danger.

16:03.253 --> 16:05.798
-So why'd he bring him?

16:10.803 --> 16:12.096
It's those things again.

16:12.179 --> 16:14.348
There's no way they'll attack
with him here.

16:14.682 --> 16:15.766
Will's right.

16:16.183 --> 16:17.351
They're not hunting us.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.603
Then what are they hunting?

16:51.051 --> 16:53.053
Danger, Will Robinson!

16:53.137 --> 16:54.388
Mom.

16:57.224 --> 16:58.684
-Will!

16:58.767 --> 17:00.269
-Will!

17:10.362 --> 17:12.239
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

17:13.824 --> 17:16.535
No, Robot! Come back here!

17:19.288 --> 17:20.539
Come back here!

17:21.874 --> 17:24.251
-No!

17:31.216 --> 17:32.342
No! Come back, please!

17:32.426 --> 17:33.886
Robot, no!

17:49.359 --> 17:50.277
Please.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.515
Will told it to come back.

18:20.766 --> 18:21.934
Why didn't it listen to him?

18:22.309 --> 18:24.394
The robot was
just helping its friend.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.106
I thought Will was his friend.

18:29.274 --> 18:30.400
Come on.

18:31.026 --> 18:32.319
We got a ride to catch.

18:38.826 --> 18:41.286
I take back what I said about
you being an amazing doctor.

18:41.370 --> 18:44.665
The fact that you can't keep up
has nothing to do with hypothermia.

18:44.748 --> 18:47.459
I think Dad can handle this,
don't know why you're dragging me into it.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.586
Maybe because you and Smith
have a special connection,

18:49.670 --> 18:52.422
and if push comes to shove
then we're gonna need your help.

18:52.506 --> 18:55.342
Okay, firstly, you are way better
at pushing and shoving than I am,

18:55.425 --> 18:57.594
and I do not have a special connection
with Smith.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.264
I just convinced her
to use her powers for good.

19:00.347 --> 19:02.683
Well, I don't know what kind of good
she'd be doing with Dad,

19:02.766 --> 19:05.853
but Dr. Smith never does anything
without an ulterior motive.

19:07.354 --> 19:09.106
You really know how to work this thing?

19:09.189 --> 19:11.066
I know how to work a computer.

19:11.650 --> 19:12.901
What I don't know

19:12.985 --> 19:15.737
is the exact time
of the original transmission

19:15.821 --> 19:17.406
they heard on the bridge.

19:17.489 --> 19:18.615
Could be any of these.

19:18.699 --> 19:20.450
Great. I'll get comfortable.

19:23.412 --> 19:24.788
You seem a little nervous.

19:24.872 --> 19:25.706
You okay?

19:28.125 --> 19:29.877
Yeah. It's just, um...

19:32.421 --> 19:34.298
I'm not used to this, you know,

19:35.215 --> 19:36.258
having a partner.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.136
I usually go it alone.

19:39.219 --> 19:40.554
-Why's that?
-That way,

19:40.637 --> 19:42.973
the only person you have to trust
is yourself.

19:43.056 --> 19:45.559
Decreases the chances
of getting screwed over.

19:45.642 --> 19:48.270
But then no one's got your back
when things go south.

19:49.354 --> 19:52.524
I've gotten pretty good at making things
go the way I want them to.

19:55.319 --> 19:56.737
Seems a little lonely to me.

19:56.820 --> 19:59.531
What does a man with a wife
and three kids know about loneliness?

20:00.324 --> 20:01.783
Haven't always been this man.

20:03.452 --> 20:04.912
It was nothing, you know,

20:04.995 --> 20:07.414
I just did some stupid things
when I was young.

20:07.497 --> 20:08.957
Got into some fights,

20:09.082 --> 20:10.876
spent a couple of nights in jail.

20:10.959 --> 20:12.544
John Robinson has a record.

20:12.920 --> 20:13.837
What'd you do?

20:14.129 --> 20:17.007
Enough for my mom and dad
to strongly recommend

20:17.090 --> 20:19.343
that I join the Navy to keep out
of trouble.

20:19.426 --> 20:21.887
- And did it work?
-Ah, mostly.

20:21.970 --> 20:23.847
You know what it did do, was teach me

20:24.139 --> 20:26.516
to rely on my brother and sisters
at my side.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.602
I had to trust them with my life.

20:29.645 --> 20:31.605
I think people have to earn your trust.

20:31.855 --> 20:33.982
How can they earn it
if you don't let 'em?

20:34.566 --> 20:37.277
I wouldn't be alive today
if I hadn't put my trust in

20:37.402 --> 20:38.904
Maureen and the kids.

20:39.446 --> 20:43.450
Hell, I even had to learn how
to trust a damn robot.

20:43.825 --> 20:45.285
And now you're trusting me.

20:49.706 --> 20:50.540
Yeah.

20:52.042 --> 20:52.960
Yeah, I am.

20:57.673 --> 21:01.093
-Found it.

21:01.176 --> 21:02.427
I've heard that before.

21:07.516 --> 21:08.392
Me, too.

21:10.143 --> 21:11.895
It's the sound from the alien ship.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.897
That's not just one ship.

21:13.981 --> 21:15.023
Where's it coming from?

21:19.069 --> 21:19.945
Everywhere.

21:29.329 --> 21:30.747
How you doing back there?

21:31.581 --> 21:34.459
Uh, Gypsy's lagging a little,
but we're fine.

21:34.793 --> 21:36.378
-I'm gonna walk him for a minute.
-Okay.

21:41.216 --> 21:42.718
Looks like our ride's here.

21:43.510 --> 21:46.221
What do you think the chances are
they brought fresh coffee?

21:49.808 --> 21:50.642
Mom!

21:50.726 --> 21:52.311
- Mom!

22:01.111 --> 22:02.571
It's gonna be okay, Gypsy.

22:08.410 --> 22:09.911
It's okay.

22:12.539 --> 22:13.373
Oh, no.

22:13.457 --> 22:14.583
It's cut.

22:16.543 --> 22:19.796
Maybe it was grazed by a horn
during the stampede,

22:19.880 --> 22:21.548
but that wouldn't have caused it to--

22:21.631 --> 22:22.507
Could be infected.

22:23.091 --> 22:25.093
That looks like some kind of toxin.

22:26.261 --> 22:27.888
It's bad, isn't it?

22:27.971 --> 22:29.473
It's spreading fast.

22:30.140 --> 22:31.558
Don't worry, buddy.

22:31.641 --> 22:34.269
Oh, Will, I don't--
I don't think he's gonna make it.

22:37.856 --> 22:38.815
Hey, buddy.

22:39.983 --> 22:40.817
I'm here.

22:45.864 --> 22:48.033
He's not like you.

22:49.743 --> 22:50.952
We can't repair him.

23:43.630 --> 23:44.506
Maureen?

23:44.840 --> 23:45.966
Just wait.

23:50.846 --> 23:51.721
What's it doing?

23:53.181 --> 23:55.183
It's grieving.

23:57.519 --> 23:58.562
It can't.

24:24.212 --> 24:25.630
Is the coast clear?

24:25.797 --> 24:26.756
For now.

24:26.923 --> 24:28.884
So, who are you gonna tell about this?

24:28.967 --> 24:31.678
When Maureen gets back,
we'll figure out what this means,

24:31.761 --> 24:33.597
how long we have, and what we do next.

24:33.847 --> 24:35.307
Maureen.

24:36.349 --> 24:37.893
And here I thought we were partners.

24:37.976 --> 24:39.978
And here I thought
you always worked alone.

24:40.687 --> 24:41.897
Touché.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.607
Ready to get out of here?

24:46.234 --> 24:47.277
After you.

24:53.742 --> 24:56.286
Okay, listen to me.
I'm gonna make this clear,

24:57.120 --> 24:58.330
this was my idea.

24:58.413 --> 25:01.458
-I made her come with me.
-We know. Thanks for the tip, Doctor.

25:04.377 --> 25:05.504
This whole time?

25:05.587 --> 25:08.632
John, you have to understand
the position you put me in.

25:09.424 --> 25:11.968
You asked me to commit an illegal act.

25:12.052 --> 25:14.679
More than illegal, mutinous.

25:14.763 --> 25:15.722
Grab him.

25:16.890 --> 25:17.933
Come on!

25:18.141 --> 25:20.435
Someday you're gonna get
what's coming to you.

25:20.519 --> 25:21.353
Dad?

25:21.436 --> 25:23.813
Girls, it's okay,
it's just a misunderstanding.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.148
Go back to the Jupiter.

25:25.398 --> 25:27.192
-Your mom will be back soon.
- What's going on?

25:27.609 --> 25:28.985
It's a misunderstanding.

25:33.823 --> 25:37.619
You did the right thing today.
From what I understand, you...

25:38.328 --> 25:40.705
you lived with the Robinsons
for a while, so...

25:41.790 --> 25:42.791
I'm curious.

25:43.542 --> 25:44.668
Why'd you turn him in?

25:45.544 --> 25:47.671
I want us to get to Alpha Centauri safely.

25:48.421 --> 25:50.465
And the news of those machines out there

25:50.549 --> 25:52.968
would cause widespread panic
in the <i>Resolute.</i>

25:53.343 --> 25:54.511
I couldn't let that happen.

25:54.594 --> 25:57.764
You're right about that. The last thing
we need right now is a panic.

25:59.140 --> 26:02.269
Well, if there's anything else
I can assist you with,

26:02.394 --> 26:04.396
please don't hesitate to ask.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.982
I'm glad to hear you say that, that's--

26:07.941 --> 26:09.693
There's been a change of plans and,

26:11.152 --> 26:14.030
I think you could be extremely valuable
in the days ahead.

26:15.782 --> 26:17.242
Always glad to help.

26:48.732 --> 26:50.442
Let's get the robot loaded first.

26:51.401 --> 26:52.736
Then unpack the horses.

26:55.822 --> 26:56.781
Come on.

27:07.250 --> 27:08.084
Will?

27:11.254 --> 27:12.088
Will.

27:16.051 --> 27:16.885
Listen to me,

27:18.053 --> 27:20.805
you do realize the importance
of what you've done here?

27:21.348 --> 27:24.476
A lot of people are finally gonna get
to go home and see their families.

27:24.559 --> 27:25.935
Don't thank me...

27:26.853 --> 27:27.729
thank him.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.028
Did you give him that?

27:37.155 --> 27:38.031
No.

27:39.324 --> 27:42.202
I guess he wanted something
to remember him by.

27:56.466 --> 27:57.300
Wait.

28:01.429 --> 28:02.681
Change of plans.

28:03.932 --> 28:06.059
We're not gonna use
that storage container.

28:07.185 --> 28:09.312
We'll find another way onto the Jupiter...

28:12.107 --> 28:13.858
that's a little less uncomfortable.

28:19.906 --> 28:22.701
Any attempt to leave this Jupiter
will activate the electromagnet

28:22.784 --> 28:24.786
and result in an electric shock.

28:24.869 --> 28:27.205
Any attempt to tamper
with the proximity sensor

28:27.288 --> 28:28.998
will result in an electric shock.

28:29.082 --> 28:31.793
Any attempt to remove
the ankle device will result in--

28:31.876 --> 28:34.003
In an electric shock. Yeah, I get it.

28:34.254 --> 28:35.213
Thanks.

28:41.469 --> 28:43.054
-Why her?

28:43.138 --> 28:44.180
I needed her help.

28:44.723 --> 28:47.058
No! You're supposed to come to us
if you need help, not her.

28:47.142 --> 28:49.102
-She's conniving and manipulative.
-Let me explain.

28:49.227 --> 28:51.688
Are you really gonna let her
talk about me like that?

28:52.355 --> 28:53.189
Really?

28:53.898 --> 28:56.276
You're just gonna sit there
and act like you've done nothing?

28:56.359 --> 28:57.485
Relax.

28:58.987 --> 28:59.946
I was invited.

29:00.029 --> 29:01.072
Judy. It's okay.

29:01.156 --> 29:03.158
No. What do you mean, it's okay?

29:04.993 --> 29:07.078
Oh. You two were--

29:08.496 --> 29:10.915
Personally, I thought your father's
performance was a bit much,

29:11.833 --> 29:13.460
but I can't argue with the results.

29:14.335 --> 29:15.712
Hastings trusts me.

29:16.379 --> 29:17.213
I'm in.

29:17.297 --> 29:19.466
So, it was all set up?

29:19.549 --> 29:22.010
It was the only way I could find out
what was really going on.

29:22.093 --> 29:23.052
So...

29:23.720 --> 29:24.721
what is really going on?

29:24.804 --> 29:27.348
Hastings asked me to serve
as  the ship's therapist

29:27.432 --> 29:29.893
in an official capacity
for the next few days

29:29.976 --> 29:31.102
to keep everyone calm.

29:31.186 --> 29:32.937
If they're trying to keep
the danger secret,

29:33.021 --> 29:34.731
why are they so concerned
about a reaction?

29:36.024 --> 29:38.943
That's a bit of a good news-
bad news situation.

29:39.027 --> 29:41.488
Why can it never just be a good news-
good news situation?

29:41.571 --> 29:43.615
As soon as Maureen and Will get back...

29:45.033 --> 29:47.744
the <i>Resolute </i>will be ready to leave
for Alpha Centauri.

29:48.244 --> 29:50.079
So the good news is
your family will be safe.

29:50.163 --> 29:50.997
Okay.

29:51.748 --> 29:52.791
What's the bad news?

29:52.874 --> 29:55.960
We'll be leaving
with only those currently on board.

29:57.670 --> 29:58.922
Currently?

29:59.005 --> 30:00.423
There's only enough water to support

30:00.507 --> 30:02.592
the transport of a limited number
of passengers.

30:02.675 --> 30:05.553
But there are hundreds of people
down there on that planet.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.764
Friends, family, children,
what about them?

30:07.847 --> 30:10.183
The decision's been made
to leave them behind.

30:12.352 --> 30:13.478
We're abandoning them.

30:36.251 --> 30:37.252
Maureen here.

30:37.710 --> 30:39.504
When can I start sending up
the rest of our people?

30:40.755 --> 30:42.507
You haven't started yet?

30:42.882 --> 30:45.093
<i>-Why?</i>
-I was hoping you could tell me.

30:45.218 --> 30:47.804
There's been no order yet.
The Jupiters in camp are still grounded.

30:49.430 --> 30:51.641
I don't know anything about it. Really.

30:54.811 --> 30:57.105
As far as I know,
they're still dealing with the quarantine.

30:57.188 --> 30:59.315
<i>They're probably just double checking</i>
<i>the docking bays.</i>

31:00.024 --> 31:01.025
Right.

31:01.693 --> 31:03.611
Maureen, when you get to the <i>Resolute,</i>

31:03.695 --> 31:05.029
tell my son I'll see him soon.

31:05.572 --> 31:06.823
<i>I will, Victor.</i>

31:12.829 --> 31:16.207
Shouldn't be much longer, everyone.
Just, um, just sit tight.

31:19.961 --> 31:20.795
Hey.

31:23.131 --> 31:24.465
When we get back up there,

31:25.258 --> 31:26.968
things are gonna be different
than last time.

31:29.137 --> 31:31.139
This time, you're gonna save everyone.

31:39.647 --> 31:41.566
<i>It should be in chains.</i>

31:42.984 --> 31:44.903
<i>We don't have to force it</i>
<i>to help us.</i>

31:46.195 --> 31:47.780
<i>It decided to on its own.</i>

31:48.823 --> 31:52.118
<i> Which means it can decide</i>
<i>to change its mind on its own, too.</i>

31:52.535 --> 31:54.037
<i> It's not gonna do that.</i>

31:54.913 --> 31:56.289
<i>It cares.</i>

31:56.706 --> 31:58.625
<i>About one boy.</i>

31:58.708 --> 32:00.126
<i>Not just about Will.</i>

32:00.209 --> 32:03.004
<i>It cares about other living things</i>
<i>as well.</i>

32:03.087 --> 32:07.634
You thought Scarecrow had a brain,
now you think Tin Man has a heart?

32:08.718 --> 32:10.511
I suppose so, yeah.

32:11.679 --> 32:13.681
<i>That only makes it</i>
<i>more dangerous.</i>

32:19.771 --> 32:20.605
We're ready.

32:23.024 --> 32:26.402
Robot...<i> </i>remove the engine
from the Jupiter 2.

32:58.059 --> 32:59.936
Hastings to bridge. It's working.

33:02.188 --> 33:03.898
It jams short-range radio signals.

33:05.316 --> 33:06.401
Well, you're the expert.

33:07.193 --> 33:11.906
In fact, you just might be the most
important person on this ship right now.

33:12.490 --> 33:14.450
Maureen, if it's okay with Will,

33:14.534 --> 33:15.868
I'd like to have a word.

33:16.786 --> 33:19.080
Some things happened while you were gone.

33:20.248 --> 33:21.082
What things?

33:21.165 --> 33:23.292
It's better if we speak
in private.

33:28.965 --> 33:30.383
<i>Alien ships.</i>

33:31.217 --> 33:32.719
<i>How many are we talking about?</i>

33:32.802 --> 33:35.888
It's hard to tell,
but given our history with these machines,

33:35.972 --> 33:39.017
I wouldn't stick around
and make an accurate count.

33:39.142 --> 33:41.269
How-- How many people know?

33:41.352 --> 33:42.979
A select few. Adler,

33:43.146 --> 33:44.981
Captain Kamal, and...

33:45.940 --> 33:47.066
your husband.

33:47.734 --> 33:48.776
You told John?

33:48.901 --> 33:50.486
He, uh, well...

33:50.611 --> 33:52.321
he actually found out on his own.

33:52.989 --> 33:55.658
Broke into a high-security
information vault.

33:56.534 --> 33:57.994
-That sounds like him.
-You understand

33:58.077 --> 34:01.039
I had to place him under house arrest,
just for appearances.

34:01.622 --> 34:03.041
You know, once we get to the colony,

34:03.124 --> 34:05.126
we can share drinks
and laugh about it, but till then

34:05.209 --> 34:07.837
-I can't be seen to be playing favorites.
-All right.

34:08.629 --> 34:11.466
I'll make sure the systems are ready,
so when the engine's in place

34:11.549 --> 34:14.052
and all the people on the planet
are back on board,

34:14.594 --> 34:15.678
we'll be ready to go.

34:16.971 --> 34:17.972
That'd be great.

34:31.319 --> 34:32.236
John?

34:35.698 --> 34:36.532
Hey.

34:36.783 --> 34:38.701
I heard you had a dust-up with Hastings?

34:38.785 --> 34:40.536
-What happened?
-Thank goodness you're back.

34:41.329 --> 34:42.830
What is she doing here?

34:44.123 --> 34:45.124
We need to talk.

34:47.335 --> 34:50.630
My dad is still down there.
Everyone is still down there.

34:50.713 --> 34:52.590
Hastings just lied right to my face.

34:52.673 --> 34:55.635
How can they expect us
to just abandon our families?

34:55.718 --> 34:57.470
No one will be left behind.

34:57.553 --> 34:59.639
The <i>Resolute's </i>leaving
soon as that engine is in place.

34:59.722 --> 35:02.058
And even if we can get everyone
back on the ship,

35:02.141 --> 35:04.685
we don't have enough oxygen
to support them.

35:04.769 --> 35:07.522
The water we brought up from the planet
is contaminated.

35:07.605 --> 35:09.941
If we run it through the OGS Systems
to make breathable air,

35:10.024 --> 35:11.109
it'll rot out the pipes.

35:11.192 --> 35:13.694
The <i>Resolute </i>will literally dissolve
from the inside out.

35:13.778 --> 35:15.446
Speaking from personal experience,

35:15.530 --> 35:16.864
that would not be awesome.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.408
There must be some way
to decontaminate the water.

35:19.492 --> 35:21.786
There is, but it would take a year

35:21.869 --> 35:23.996
to collect the amount of ammonia gas
we'd need to do it.

35:24.080 --> 35:27.583
And there's no way Hastings
and his team are waiting around for that.

35:28.835 --> 35:30.169
I need to collect my thoughts.

35:43.141 --> 35:44.725
I think that means we're ready.

35:46.435 --> 35:48.312
Now let's move it to the engine room.

35:55.111 --> 35:56.154
Come on.

36:06.581 --> 36:07.832
-Hey.
-Hey.

36:07.915 --> 36:09.542
We didn't get a chance to talk.

36:09.750 --> 36:10.835
How was it down there?

36:10.918 --> 36:12.420
-How's Will?
- He's good.

36:13.129 --> 36:14.380
He got his friend back,

36:14.630 --> 36:15.631
but...

36:16.591 --> 36:18.759
he's different, somehow.

36:19.552 --> 36:20.595
The robot?

36:20.928 --> 36:22.597
Yeah. He's just, uh...

36:24.557 --> 36:25.474
What is it?

36:25.558 --> 36:28.853
Izabel, what do we know about that planet?

36:36.152 --> 36:37.403
This idea is crazy.

36:37.486 --> 36:38.696
Never stopped us before.

36:38.779 --> 36:39.697
Really wish it would.

36:39.780 --> 36:40.865
Look, we have to try.

36:41.574 --> 36:43.701
We have to explain to them
that there is a way.

36:43.784 --> 36:45.745
Even if you're right
about the planet out there,

36:45.828 --> 36:48.664
Hastings and Kamal will never put
the <i>Resolute </i>at that kind of risk.

36:48.748 --> 36:50.917
Well, then, let's not ask for permission.

36:51.459 --> 36:52.668
That's mutiny.

36:52.752 --> 36:53.628
-Is it?
-Yeah.

36:53.711 --> 36:56.297
Taking a ship somewhere
the captain doesn't want it to go?

36:56.380 --> 36:57.506
That's mutiny.

36:59.926 --> 37:01.594
There will be consequences.

37:01.677 --> 37:03.971
Any worse than for the people
being left behind?

37:11.646 --> 37:14.065
First thing we need is a plan.

37:15.024 --> 37:16.025
I agree.

37:16.943 --> 37:17.985
Totally.
