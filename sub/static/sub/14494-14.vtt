00:30.915 --> 00:33.616
Whirlwind, boy did I miss you.

00:33.651 --> 00:36.820
But, man, you're not so smart.

00:36.854 --> 00:39.389
I mean, you get beat up by me,

00:39.423 --> 00:41.858
you go to jail, you breakout,
then you come back here?

00:41.892 --> 00:45.662
Everybody knows this is where I shop.

00:56.373 --> 00:58.675
But here's the real question.

00:58.709 --> 01:00.343
Why do you like prison so much?

01:02.513 --> 01:04.848
Whirlwind? Dave?

01:04.882 --> 01:09.352
Not feeling chatty today?

01:09.386 --> 01:10.587
What?

01:13.457 --> 01:14.924
Enchantress.

01:14.959 --> 01:16.459
I don't know what you're up to,

01:16.494 --> 01:17.927
but get ready to--

01:23.601 --> 01:25.101
[gasps]

01:29.406 --> 01:30.607
Ow.

01:39.984 --> 01:41.918
What? You think I'm gonna give up?

01:41.952 --> 01:43.319
Think again. I'm an Avenger.

01:43.354 --> 01:44.854
Aah!

01:44.889 --> 01:46.356
[grunts]

01:52.396 --> 01:55.131
One down.

02:07.178 --> 02:09.979
<i>* Our world's about to break *</i>

02:10.014 --> 02:13.416
<i>* Tormented and upset *</i>

02:13.450 --> 02:16.553
<i>* The loss from when wake *</i>

02:16.587 --> 02:19.589
<i>* With no way to go back *</i>

02:19.623 --> 02:22.659
<i>* I'm standing on my own *</i>

02:22.693 --> 02:26.963
<i>* But now I'm not alone *</i>

02:26.997 --> 02:32.001
<i>* Always we will fight as one *</i>

02:32.036 --> 02:34.771
<i>* Till the battle's won *</i>

02:34.805 --> 02:38.141
<i>* With evil on the run *</i>

02:38.175 --> 02:40.810
<i>* We never come undone *</i>

02:40.844 --> 02:44.380
<i>* Assemble, we are strong *</i>

02:44.415 --> 02:47.483
<i>* Forever fight as one *</i>

02:47.518 --> 02:50.820
<i>* Assemble, we are strong *</i>

02:50.854 --> 02:54.791
<i>* Forever fight as one *</i>

02:56.177 --> 02:58.011
[Hawkeye] Okay, so listen.

02:58.046 --> 03:00.814
You realize the Avengers are
a complete disaster, right?

03:00.848 --> 03:04.918
Iron-Man is completely unqualified
to lead a team like this.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.219
Thor is crazy.

03:06.254 --> 03:09.022
The Hulk is a bomb waiting to go off.

03:09.057 --> 03:10.390
Ant-Man couldn't be less interested

03:10.425 --> 03:12.325
in taking down bad guys.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.594
And Wasp belongs on the party circuit.

03:14.629 --> 03:16.363
Not in law enforcement.

03:16.397 --> 03:18.532
You forgot Captain America.

03:22.537 --> 03:25.205
And you, you're a king.

03:25.239 --> 03:28.041
Sitting here in your-- your--

03:28.076 --> 03:29.142
What is this place anyway?

03:29.177 --> 03:30.510
The Wakandan Embassy.

03:30.545 --> 03:33.380
An embassy for crying out loud.

03:33.414 --> 03:36.083
What do you care about the Avengers?

03:36.117 --> 03:38.185
Are you bored?

03:39.721 --> 03:40.954
[gags]

03:42.590 --> 03:44.624
You eat that? What is it?

03:44.659 --> 03:47.494
The juices of the heart shaped herb

03:47.528 --> 03:50.664
enhance the senses of the
kings of the Panther Tribe.

03:50.698 --> 03:54.334
And in point of fact, it
is applied to the skin.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.169
and a lethal poison

03:56.204 --> 03:58.505
to those who are not of the royal line.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.006
[gasps]

04:08.015 --> 04:11.418
[Iron-Man] No, no, no, the suits
have to be in an expandable array.

04:11.452 --> 04:13.353
Interchangeable, too.

04:13.387 --> 04:16.255
So I can have any suit
at any time, in seconds.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.125
<i>[JARVIS] You only have
three suits, sir.</i>

04:18.159 --> 04:20.293
Sure, now, but what if--

04:20.327 --> 04:21.628
Why are you arguing with me?

04:21.661 --> 04:23.330
Just reconfigure it.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.498
<i>[JARVIS] Mansion update.</i>

04:24.532 --> 04:26.967
<i>Avenger ID, Wasp, accepted.</i>

04:27.001 --> 04:29.369
Oh, good. Jan would want
me to have more suits.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.204
Maybe you'll do what she says.

04:31.239 --> 04:33.573
<i>[JARVIS] Ms.
Van Dyne is not-- is not--</i>

04:33.608 --> 04:35.642
JARVIS?

04:35.676 --> 04:37.511
<i>[JARVIS] Catastrophic system error.</i>

04:37.545 --> 04:38.578
Whoa!

04:43.651 --> 04:44.751
Aah!

04:48.055 --> 04:49.322
[strains]

04:52.460 --> 04:54.427
No, Dynamo.

04:54.462 --> 04:56.129
[strains]

04:56.164 --> 04:58.632
Not yet.

04:58.666 --> 05:01.401
[cries out]

05:05.239 --> 05:07.073
<i>[Announcer] Kirby Kibble dog food,</i>

05:07.108 --> 05:10.544
<i>now with the Kirby dots of
real beef that dogs love.</i>

05:14.148 --> 05:19.052
Ugh, stupid commercials.

05:19.086 --> 05:22.689
Hello again, monster.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.024
Huh?

05:27.495 --> 05:29.196
[growlu]

05:56.457 --> 05:58.325
[pants]

06:16.043 --> 06:17.077
Huh?

06:17.111 --> 06:18.278
Tony?

06:28.122 --> 06:30.257
[grunts]

06:33.828 --> 06:35.395
[Captain America cries out]

06:40.134 --> 06:45.772
I told you when we last met
this wasn't over, Captain.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.841
Now it is.

06:51.646 --> 06:53.313
What of Thor?

06:53.347 --> 06:56.249
I haven't forgotten, Enchantress.

06:56.284 --> 07:00.053
The Thunderer and Ant-Man remain.

07:00.087 --> 07:03.590
Avengers, assemble.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.825
[beeps]

07:14.235 --> 07:16.836
[Foster] So is your dad
still taking his big nap?

07:16.871 --> 07:18.638
What did you call it again?

07:18.673 --> 07:20.774
The Odin sleep.

07:20.808 --> 07:25.111
No, he has woken by now.

07:25.146 --> 07:27.814
And you haven't talked to him yet?

07:27.848 --> 07:29.516
Nay, Jane Foster.

07:29.550 --> 07:32.452
I have not returned to
Asgard since we last spoke.

07:32.486 --> 07:34.120
I have been needed here.

07:40.361 --> 07:42.195
The Avengers are formidable,

07:42.229 --> 07:46.800
but the threats they face...

07:46.834 --> 07:49.736
It would seem I am needed more than ever.

07:53.307 --> 07:55.408
[ringing sounds]

07:57.878 --> 07:59.846
This card is troubling.

07:59.880 --> 08:03.350
Iron-Man's technology is
constantly making noises at me.

08:03.384 --> 08:05.752
I think they're calling you, Thor.

08:05.786 --> 08:08.221
Like you said, you're needed.

08:27.308 --> 08:29.876
Ho, Avengers. Ho, computer.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.311
Thor has arrived.

08:31.345 --> 08:33.613
Welcome Asgardian.

08:33.647 --> 08:36.416
I know of thee.

08:36.450 --> 08:39.251
You are Captain America's foe.

08:39.285 --> 08:40.285
Zemo.

08:40.321 --> 08:43.523
[chuckles]

08:43.557 --> 08:45.792
You may call me master.

08:45.826 --> 08:48.128
Now, kneel before me.

08:48.162 --> 08:50.196
Are you mad, mortal?

08:50.231 --> 08:53.833
Thor kneels before no one.

09:04.645 --> 09:08.548
As I said, kneel before your masters.

09:50.918 --> 09:53.453
[Hawkeye] Well, that's not good.

09:53.487 --> 09:56.356
All right, we call in SHIELD, go
in with the Hulkbuster gear--

09:56.390 --> 09:57.523
And destroy the city

09:57.558 --> 09:59.292
in the issuing battle

09:59.326 --> 10:02.996
as well as seal the fates
of our captive teammates.

10:03.030 --> 10:04.330
Well, what do you recommend?

10:06.500 --> 10:08.534
Indeed. It is up to us.

10:19.780 --> 10:21.314
What are you going to do, Zemo?

10:21.348 --> 10:23.883
Do not be so troubled, my Wonderman.

10:23.917 --> 10:26.719
All you need to know is
that if you do as I say,

10:26.754 --> 10:29.055
you will get your humanity back.

10:29.089 --> 10:31.658
And you needn't worry either, Dynamo.

10:31.692 --> 10:32.892
You can have Iron-Man.

10:32.926 --> 10:36.796
I have a much bigger appetite.

10:36.830 --> 10:38.464
When?

10:38.499 --> 10:41.634
When I say so.

11:11.999 --> 11:14.467
[coughs]

11:14.501 --> 11:16.736
Zemo.

11:16.770 --> 11:18.871
Welcome back, Captain.

11:18.906 --> 11:20.907
You've got me, Zemo.

11:20.941 --> 11:24.377
There's no need to involve anyone else.

11:24.411 --> 11:28.881
[laughs]

11:28.916 --> 11:31.718
Ah, but the Avengers are
already spoken for, Captain.

11:31.752 --> 11:35.088
You're new friends have
made powerful enemies.

11:35.122 --> 11:36.689
What do you want?

11:36.724 --> 11:38.424
The war is over.

11:38.459 --> 11:40.393
After all these years,

11:40.427 --> 11:43.129
is revenge on me really
that important to you?

11:43.163 --> 11:46.399
Yes. But now, Captain,

11:46.433 --> 11:48.000
I've been promised the world.

11:48.035 --> 11:52.572
And you will live just long
enough to see me have it.

12:17.498 --> 12:21.434
[groans]

12:21.468 --> 12:24.404
Ssh, be at ease, my love.

12:24.438 --> 12:26.439
You are safe with me.

12:26.473 --> 12:27.840
[strains]

12:27.875 --> 12:30.610
Enchantress?

12:30.644 --> 12:32.879
What are you doing, Amora?

12:32.913 --> 12:37.049
You are an Asgardian, not some
lackey to a mortal villain.

12:37.084 --> 12:39.685
Zemo is but a toy

12:39.720 --> 12:42.588
to be discarded when I tire of him.

12:42.623 --> 12:44.590
What do you want?

12:44.625 --> 12:46.759
You of course.

12:46.794 --> 12:49.629
You have always been my heart's desire.

12:49.663 --> 12:53.132
We could leave Midgard and Asgard behind,

12:53.167 --> 12:54.901
and we can be together.

12:54.935 --> 12:57.136
I say thee nay.

12:57.171 --> 12:58.638
What are you doing, Enchantress?

12:58.672 --> 13:01.974
It's a mistake to keep them alive, Zemo.

13:02.009 --> 13:05.178
I will not be questioned
by you, Abomination.

13:05.212 --> 13:07.046
Don't ignore me.

13:07.080 --> 13:09.615
You got no powers, no strength.

13:09.650 --> 13:10.850
You're nothing.

13:10.884 --> 13:13.219
So why are you giving orders to us?

13:13.253 --> 13:16.155
The Avengers are done
and so is this mission.

13:16.190 --> 13:21.260
The Hulk is still alive, but
the bigger threat is Ant-Man.

13:21.295 --> 13:22.695
[chuckles]

13:22.729 --> 13:25.765
Ant-Man? If you're worried about Ant-Man,

13:25.799 --> 13:29.001
then we really are better off without--

13:31.972 --> 13:34.574
Ant-Man is the last Avenger.

13:34.608 --> 13:35.775
He's a threat.

13:35.809 --> 13:39.579
And you wish to know why I lead?

13:39.613 --> 13:41.514
Because I am better than you.

13:41.548 --> 13:45.518
Ant-Man is not the last Avenger.

13:45.552 --> 13:48.054
There's two more. [grunts]

13:48.088 --> 13:49.589
[electricity crackles]

13:56.530 --> 13:58.531
Okay, that was a good move.

13:58.565 --> 14:01.567
You are worm food, mortal.

14:01.602 --> 14:02.635
[yells]

14:03.804 --> 14:05.505
<i>[Dynamo] Zemo, another Avenger</i>

14:05.539 --> 14:06.706
<i>is inside the mansion.</i>

14:06.740 --> 14:07.907
<i>The Wakandan.</i>

14:09.576 --> 14:12.245
Some one crush him.

14:16.517 --> 14:18.651
[strains]

14:28.595 --> 14:30.930
[cries out]

14:30.964 --> 14:33.666
I owe you some payback, Robin Hood.

14:33.700 --> 14:37.069
Please, I'm begging you.

14:37.104 --> 14:38.538
Brush your teeth.

14:44.244 --> 14:45.611
Hawkeye, are you insane?

14:45.646 --> 14:46.979
Why didn't you bring in SHIELD?

14:47.014 --> 14:48.714
[grunts]

14:48.749 --> 14:50.283
See, I knew it.

14:50.317 --> 14:55.555
Ah, the SHIELD agent
and the Wakandan King.

14:55.589 --> 14:57.023
You should have walked
away from the Avengers

14:57.057 --> 14:59.191
before it came to this.

14:59.226 --> 15:02.028
Now, you must be punished.

15:02.062 --> 15:03.229
I am an Avenger,

15:03.263 --> 15:05.331
and I will meet my end with pride.

15:07.167 --> 15:10.036
I'm gonna meet mine with
kicking and screaming.

15:14.945 --> 15:16.879
[Zemo] You choose, Captain.

15:16.914 --> 15:22.585
Which of your teammates will be
the first to taste my blade?

15:22.620 --> 15:24.988
You know what, Zemo? I want to go first.

15:25.022 --> 15:26.623
I'm tired of listening to you.

15:26.657 --> 15:29.592
Amusing. Did you really believe

15:29.627 --> 15:32.195
the two of you could defeat all of us?

15:32.229 --> 15:35.965
Weird. Purple puss here seems to
think we were trying to defeat him.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.967
[Black Panther] I heard.

15:38.002 --> 15:39.268
He is misguided.

15:39.303 --> 15:41.938
We were not trying to
defeat your team, Baron.

15:41.972 --> 15:43.272
We were simply allowing

15:43.307 --> 15:46.242
Ant-Man uninterrupted access to his lab.

15:46.276 --> 15:49.112
[Hawkeye] Yeah, we picked him
up from the Wakandan Embassy

15:49.146 --> 15:51.648
while you tools were starting
your little siege here.

15:51.682 --> 15:54.017
He just needed to get a few things.

15:54.051 --> 15:56.085
Ugh.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.888
Surrender, Zemo.

15:58.922 --> 16:01.124
End this before anyone gets hurt.

16:04.395 --> 16:06.796
[groans]

16:06.830 --> 16:08.798
Hank?

16:08.832 --> 16:10.667
Are you crazy? Run!

16:10.701 --> 16:14.037
Tear him apart!

16:16.306 --> 16:18.341
Sorry, Simon.

16:18.375 --> 16:20.043
[cries out]

16:27.651 --> 16:30.253
He's shrunk down. Dynamo.

16:39.797 --> 16:41.097
Come on, bug.

16:41.131 --> 16:43.366
What are you--

16:45.069 --> 16:47.203
[cries out]

16:59.049 --> 17:02.819
[groans]

17:07.724 --> 17:11.661
JARVIS, activate remote recall. Mach 7.

17:11.694 --> 17:13.396
<i>[JARVIS] Remote launch activated.</i>

17:18.769 --> 17:21.204
[breathes heavy]

17:24.374 --> 17:28.176
Thor, you would not harm would you?

17:28.212 --> 17:30.313
Nay.

17:33.884 --> 17:35.418
[growls]

17:38.122 --> 17:39.856
But my friend might.

17:41.158 --> 17:44.026
You.

17:44.061 --> 17:46.829
[roars]

17:46.864 --> 17:49.098
Executioner, I need you.

17:59.977 --> 18:01.844
I'd like my shield back now.

18:01.879 --> 18:03.780
It needs to be cleaned.

18:28.872 --> 18:31.407
Simon, I'm glad to see you up and about,

18:31.441 --> 18:33.209
but what are you doing with these people?

18:33.243 --> 18:35.878
You're a good man, you don't
want any part of this.

18:35.913 --> 18:37.413
I don't have any choice.

18:37.447 --> 18:39.949
They're the only reason I'm even alive.

18:39.983 --> 18:43.886
And if I want to stay alive,
I do what they say.

18:56.967 --> 18:58.301
All right, team,

18:58.335 --> 19:02.104
I want this scum out
of my house right now.

19:02.139 --> 19:06.342
Destroy them all!

19:11.949 --> 19:13.583
Stark!

19:13.617 --> 19:15.818
[grunts] [yells]

19:15.853 --> 19:17.887
[grunts]

19:25.195 --> 19:26.863
This is gonna to hurt.

19:26.897 --> 19:29.298
And I won't lie to you, I'm kind of glad.

19:29.333 --> 19:32.568
[groans]

19:41.311 --> 19:42.345
[arrow beeps]

20:10.641 --> 20:13.276
Enchantress, we are leaving.

20:13.310 --> 20:14.644
[roars]

20:19.416 --> 20:20.483
[grunts]

20:43.073 --> 20:45.641
So when did you get back from Wakanda?

20:45.676 --> 20:49.111
Ugh, you know, I'm not so sure I want

20:49.146 --> 20:52.581
to be part of a team I
have to rescue every week.

20:52.616 --> 20:55.451
Perhaps they will elect
you team leader now?

20:55.485 --> 20:57.186
Really? You think?

20:57.220 --> 20:58.421
Okay, stop.

20:58.455 --> 20:59.622
Everyone stop.

20:59.656 --> 21:01.490
Does anyone know what that was all about?

21:01.525 --> 21:03.492
Our enemies wish vengeance upon us.

21:03.527 --> 21:06.329
Defeat does not sit well with some.

21:06.363 --> 21:07.897
I'm not so sure.

21:07.931 --> 21:12.535
Zemo. He seems so certain
of what he was doing

21:12.569 --> 21:15.071
like it was going to put the
world right in his hands.

21:15.105 --> 21:16.505
How?

21:16.540 --> 21:18.941
He said someone had promised it to him.

21:25.449 --> 21:28.684
I told you not to underestimate them.

21:28.719 --> 21:31.620
And you didn't account for
the Panther and Hawkeye.

21:33.256 --> 21:35.257
Enough.

21:35.292 --> 21:38.060
It doesn't matter. None of it does.

21:38.095 --> 21:39.996
For it is all a game.

21:40.030 --> 21:42.198
And you've played your parts.

21:51.341 --> 21:54.477
The pieces are in place, My Lord.
