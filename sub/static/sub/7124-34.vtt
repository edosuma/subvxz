00:04.783 --> 00:06.053
Chips?

00:08.262 --> 00:09.279
Ice cream?

00:09.347 --> 00:10.588
Chips!

00:13.324 --> 00:14.385
Chips.

00:14.462 --> 00:15.548
Ch-i-ips!

00:15.676 --> 00:16.882
Ice cream!

00:19.498 --> 00:20.607
I don't get it.

00:20.684 --> 00:22.115
Ah, just keep watching.

00:22.192 --> 00:24.677
BMO said the second act gets crazy.

00:24.942 --> 00:26.528
Chips chips chips.

00:26.605 --> 00:28.082
Chips chips...

00:28.159 --> 00:29.371
Chips!

00:29.571 --> 00:31.081
Ice cream!

00:33.370 --> 00:34.393
Chips...

00:34.470 --> 00:36.086
Ice cream...

00:44.083 --> 00:45.746
Bravo!

00:46.149 --> 00:48.527
What the stuff was that?!

00:49.165 --> 00:52.428
Now, who wants to invite
me over for dinner?

00:53.481 --> 00:55.166
Come on, kids!

00:55.243 --> 00:57.170
We're going to grandma's.

00:58.830 --> 01:00.769
Dinner?

01:02.521 --> 01:04.384
Please can we invite him to dinner?!

01:04.461 --> 01:05.492
No.

01:05.603 --> 01:08.169
But, Jake, I never ask you for anything.

01:08.246 --> 01:10.244
When did I ever ask you for anything?

01:10.321 --> 01:11.459
Yesterday.

01:11.536 --> 01:14.695
You said, "Jake, please take
me to see Chips and Ice Cream!

01:14.772 --> 01:16.355
It's a Broadway Smash!"

01:16.432 --> 01:18.215
And I believed you.

01:19.808 --> 01:22.292
You don't understand me, Jake.

01:26.647 --> 01:28.075
Please come over for dinner!

01:28.152 --> 01:29.356
I love you!

01:29.850 --> 01:30.875
Yeah.

01:30.952 --> 01:32.672
Dinner sounds great!

01:33.042 --> 01:34.459
Yeah! Wait.

01:34.536 --> 01:36.282
The place where you eat dinner,

01:36.359 --> 01:40.088
does the moon shine through
the window at night?

01:40.411 --> 01:41.457
Sure.

01:41.592 --> 01:42.952
All right!

01:43.029 --> 01:44.965
Let's do it!

01:46.626 --> 01:47.701
Oh, ooh!

01:47.778 --> 01:51.617
And when chips trips over the
turtle, it was so funny!

01:51.694 --> 01:53.387
But also sad.

01:53.464 --> 01:56.803
It made me think about the
fragility of my own life.

01:56.880 --> 01:58.602
Just a little more...

01:58.679 --> 02:00.749
Y'all ready for some sushi burgers?

02:00.826 --> 02:02.018
I don't eat burgers.

02:02.095 --> 02:03.744
Got any chips and ice cream?

02:03.821 --> 02:05.175
Uh... sure.

02:05.252 --> 02:07.356
I just sculpted these buns, though.

02:07.558 --> 02:10.202
Give the man what he wants!

02:12.124 --> 02:13.250
Soooo...

02:13.327 --> 02:15.489
Is your name chips and ice cream?

02:15.566 --> 02:17.621
My name is Morty Rogers.

02:17.698 --> 02:18.925
I see.

02:19.132 --> 02:20.966
Okay! Food's done.

02:24.420 --> 02:27.648
Let's <i> all</i> dig in.

02:29.543 --> 02:31.468
Yes, eat it.

02:31.545 --> 02:33.443
Eat that chips and ice cream.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.338
Oh! Yes, sir!

02:38.979 --> 02:41.250
It's time.

02:42.617 --> 02:44.311
Chips chips chips?

02:44.388 --> 02:45.600
Ice cream ice cream.

02:45.677 --> 02:48.421
No... flipping... way!

02:48.498 --> 02:50.439
By the light of the waxing moon,

02:50.516 --> 02:53.358
which was just unveiled
by the parting clouds,

02:53.435 --> 02:55.948
I command these two imps
that have taken

02:56.025 --> 02:59.351
possession of my ears
to transfer onto the head of

02:59.428 --> 03:03.625
the being who is directly across
from me and is currently eating

03:03.702 --> 03:06.006
chips and ice cream!

03:14.503 --> 03:16.079
Chips chips?

03:16.156 --> 03:17.707
Ice cream...

03:18.208 --> 03:19.216
Huh.

03:19.293 --> 03:20.310
It worked!

03:20.387 --> 03:22.171
I'm a free bear!

03:27.434 --> 03:30.333
Well, now I'm a guy with
these things on my head.

03:30.410 --> 03:32.523
I guess I'm just gonna
roll with the punches.

03:32.600 --> 03:33.643
Uh...

03:33.715 --> 03:34.724
Don't worry, man.

03:34.801 --> 03:36.615
I'm gonna pretend they're not even there.

03:36.683 --> 03:37.694
Chips!

03:37.778 --> 03:38.802
Ice cream!

03:38.870 --> 03:42.320
This is the greatest day of my liiiife!

03:44.618 --> 03:45.812
Chips chips chips...

03:45.889 --> 03:48.239
Chips chips...

03:48.378 --> 03:50.429
Maybe if I put
a towel over my head,

03:50.506 --> 03:51.643
they'll go to sleep.

03:51.720 --> 03:52.901
Huh.
What's on your head?

03:52.978 --> 03:54.097
I don't even notice it.

03:54.174 --> 03:56.270
- Heh.
- Yeah, okay.

03:56.347 --> 03:57.593
Chips chips.

03:57.670 --> 03:58.799
Ice cream.

04:03.252 --> 04:04.466
Chips...

04:05.057 --> 04:06.132
Chips...

04:06.209 --> 04:07.269
Huh?

04:07.945 --> 04:08.961
Chips...

04:09.038 --> 04:10.430

04:10.897 --> 04:12.115

Chips chips chips chips chips!

04:21.880 --> 04:24.390
Ice cream?
Ice cream ice cream ice cream!

04:24.846 --> 04:26.195
All right, that's enough.

04:26.272 --> 04:27.788
They're going outside.

04:27.895 --> 04:29.619
Noooooooo!

04:31.373 --> 04:32.964
- Chips.
- Ice cream.

05:12.882 --> 05:14.955
I got to get to the
farmer's market before all

05:15.032 --> 05:16.432
the choice stuff is gone.

05:16.500 --> 05:17.557
Oh.

05:17.634 --> 05:18.946
Why is BMO on your head?

05:19.023 --> 05:20.335
- He is?!
- Chips chips.

05:20.412 --> 05:21.494
Ice cream.

05:21.562 --> 05:23.241
I'm onto something important.

05:23.318 --> 05:24.909
Quit clownin' around.

05:24.986 --> 05:26.987
Okay. I was done anyhows.

05:29.352 --> 05:31.531
Chips chips...

05:31.881 --> 05:33.799
So, you want me
to pick up any snacks?

05:33.876 --> 05:36.033
Yeah, maybe some ketchup chips?

05:36.110 --> 05:37.300
Chips.

05:37.444 --> 05:39.790
And... some kale...

05:39.867 --> 05:40.859
Chips.

05:40.936 --> 05:42.147
Chips!

05:42.609 --> 05:44.823
And some corn... chips.

05:44.900 --> 05:45.948
Chips!

05:46.016 --> 05:47.533
Okay.

05:49.087 --> 05:50.129
Later, dude.

05:50.197 --> 05:51.225
Later.

05:51.293 --> 05:52.974
<i>Chips!
Ice cream!</i>

05:56.059 --> 05:57.266
Hmm.

05:57.365 --> 05:58.845
Nice choice!

05:58.922 --> 06:00.664
Those are two of my fave.

06:00.741 --> 06:01.770
Chips!

06:01.920 --> 06:03.439
Yeah, we have chips.

06:03.828 --> 06:05.046
Ice cream?

06:05.198 --> 06:06.606
Sorry. I don't have any ice cream,

06:06.683 --> 06:08.048
but I know who does.

06:08.186 --> 06:09.518
Hey, John!

06:09.717 --> 06:10.903
Yo!

06:10.980 --> 06:12.886
I gots a customer for yous!

06:13.005 --> 06:14.776
I'll bag these for you.

06:18.112 --> 06:20.150
Enjoy and stay awesome.

06:20.227 --> 06:21.709
Yo! I got ice creams!

06:21.786 --> 06:22.842
Ice cream?

06:22.937 --> 06:24.724
I recommend the hamburger flavor.

06:24.801 --> 06:27.558
Also, the pizza flavor
is tremendous!

06:27.635 --> 06:28.823
Do you have taco?

06:28.900 --> 06:30.222
One second!

06:30.527 --> 06:32.152
One taco flavored.

06:32.229 --> 06:33.720
You have the best!

06:33.797 --> 06:36.673
You have the best,
out-of-this-world day.

06:36.900 --> 06:39.040
What's your spectacular choice?

06:39.873 --> 06:41.051
No. No!

06:41.128 --> 06:42.130
Stay away!

06:42.207 --> 06:43.961
You can't make me
take them back!

06:44.174 --> 06:45.717
Oh, hey, Morty Rogers.

06:45.794 --> 06:47.263
Ice cream!

06:47.361 --> 06:49.862
Aaaaaaah!

06:50.385 --> 06:51.800
Tremendous!

06:55.377 --> 06:56.588
No more chips.

06:56.665 --> 06:58.240
No more ice cream.

07:00.972 --> 07:02.041
Beans.

07:02.125 --> 07:04.470
That's what
regular-sized-ear folks eat.

07:04.547 --> 07:07.381
Regular old Morty Rogers.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.822

07:34.467 --> 07:37.103
I hope the record is not
scratched or chipped.

07:37.390 --> 07:38.493
Chip?

07:38.655 --> 07:40.186
Ice cream.

07:50.540 --> 07:52.024

08:01.618 --> 08:03.342
Hush! Hush!

08:03.419 --> 08:04.762
Hush!

08:05.689 --> 08:07.373
Noiseless, chips!

08:07.450 --> 08:09.261

08:18.672 --> 08:20.065
Aah! Quiet!

08:20.142 --> 08:22.215
I thought I could just
ignore them, but I can't!

08:22.292 --> 08:24.217
Chips and ice cream have to go!

08:24.294 --> 08:27.204
Listen. Even if I could
find Morty Rogers again,

08:27.288 --> 08:29.597
I don't know how to get these
things to go back to him

08:29.667 --> 08:31.207
or even if they want to.

08:31.284 --> 08:32.982
- Chips chips!
- Ice cream!

08:33.558 --> 08:35.775
I finished with my computations!

08:35.852 --> 08:39.169
As I thought, it's a real
language they are speaking...

08:39.246 --> 08:40.917
Based on intonations!

08:40.994 --> 08:43.086
Chips?
Chips chips chips!

08:43.163 --> 08:44.526
Ice cream?

08:44.661 --> 08:45.849
- Chips chips chips!
- Ice cream ice cream!

08:45.926 --> 08:47.108
Ice Cream!

08:48.395 --> 08:50.388
I know what we have to do.

08:54.129 --> 08:57.983
How many years did I search
for a rube to take my burden?

08:58.060 --> 08:59.532
What's wrong with me?

08:59.609 --> 09:02.017
You two brought me nothing but pain...

09:02.094 --> 09:04.074
And I can't stop thinking of you.

09:04.151 --> 09:05.969
But I don't want you back!

09:06.082 --> 09:07.568
I don't want you!

Chips chips chips...

09:42.784 --> 09:44.359
which was just unveiled
by the parting clouds,

09:44.427 --> 09:46.273
transfer those two imps
that have taken possession

09:46.341 --> 09:47.927
of Jake's ears to the
head of the being who is

09:47.995 --> 09:50.504
watching from the window!
Chips and ice cream!

09:53.930 --> 09:56.033
BMO, it's happening!

09:59.853 --> 10:00.907
No!

10:00.984 --> 10:04.712
My chips! And ice cream!

10:04.789 --> 10:05.658
Free!

10:05.735 --> 10:07.371
Noooo!

10:07.777 --> 10:08.901
Whoa.

10:08.978 --> 10:10.513
What's going on?

10:10.590 --> 10:12.742
Chips and ice cream
wanted to be free.

10:12.819 --> 10:15.745
But they could only be
released if I interrupted

10:15.822 --> 10:18.757
- the transference ritual.
- Free?

10:18.888 --> 10:21.756
I'm sorry for keeping you
dudes as my prisoners

10:21.833 --> 10:23.170
for so many years.

10:23.247 --> 10:26.258
But what am I gonna do
without you?!

10:26.335 --> 10:27.371
Chips.
