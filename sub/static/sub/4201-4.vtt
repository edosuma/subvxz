WEBVTT

00:01.268 --> 00:03.003
April:
PREVIOUSLY ON  CHASING LIFE...

00:03.036 --> 00:05.506
-WILL YOU MARRY ME?
-YOU CAN ALWAYS THINK
ABOUT IT SOME MORE.

00:05.538 --> 00:08.576
-MOM.
-FINE. I AM TOTALLY
SUPPORTIVE OF YOU

00:08.609 --> 00:10.111
AND YOUR WHIRLWIND MARRIAGE.

00:10.144 --> 00:12.512
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
MAKE ANOTHER SACRIFICE.

00:12.545 --> 00:14.615
YOU'RE MAKING ME
LEAVE CHARTON?

00:14.647 --> 00:17.150
I CAN'T REALLY SAY NO
TO APRIL THESE DAYS.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.320
-(cell phone buzzes)
-AND THERE'S THE PERSON
I CAN'T SAY NO TO.

00:19.353 --> 00:20.788
-WHO'S THAT?
-MY EX.

00:21.021 --> 00:24.257
-WE HAVE A MATCH.
-FINALLY.

00:24.291 --> 00:26.727
I FOUND DAD'S
UNPUBLISHED MANUSCRIPT.

00:26.760 --> 00:29.562
OUR DAD...
IS THE WORST.

00:29.597 --> 00:32.665
-IS THAT DAD'S BOOK?
-YEAH.

00:35.201 --> 00:37.438
April's voice:
OUR NATION'S PRESIDENT
WASN'T THE ONLY MAN

00:37.470 --> 00:39.740
PARTAKING IN SOME
NEFARIOUS ACTIVITIES.

00:39.774 --> 00:41.642
I HOPE THEY IMPEACH HIM.

00:41.674 --> 00:44.277
NOW, ROSE,
THAT IS NO WAY TO TALK
ABOUT OUR PRESIDENT.

00:47.615 --> 00:50.817
April's voice:  I CAN'T
IMAGINE WHAT SHE'D THINK
OF ME IF SHE KNEW THE TRUTH.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.520
TRYING TO MAKE UP
FOR THE FACT THAT YOU'RE GOING

00:52.552 --> 00:54.621
TO BE GONE
ON YOUR FISHING TRIP
FOR SO LONG?

00:54.655 --> 00:57.223
-April's voice:  PRECISELY.
-OF COURSE NOT.

00:57.258 --> 01:00.293
REMIND ME AGAIN WHY
YOU'RE GOING TO BE GONE
FOR TWO WHOLE WEEKS?

01:00.326 --> 01:03.164
April's voice:
I DREW A BLANK ON THE EXCUSE
I'D TOLD THIS TIME.

01:03.197 --> 01:06.534
WITH SO MANY LIES,
IT WAS HARDER TO KEEP
TRACK OF THE REALITY.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.234
I HAD THREE JOBS:

01:08.269 --> 01:10.603
KEEPING MY OBLIGATION
DOWN SOUTH COMPLIANT,

01:10.638 --> 01:13.641
MAKING SURE
MY FAMILY IN RHODE ISLAND
REMAINED OBLIVIOUS,

01:13.674 --> 01:15.475
- AND...
-HEY, CARSON,

01:15.509 --> 01:16.777
TURN ON THE TV!

01:16.811 --> 01:18.579
-(gunshot)
-(grunts)

01:18.611 --> 01:20.548
NANCY, ROSE, ELLEN,
STAY DOWN!

01:20.581 --> 01:23.117
-WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T GET UP.
-DAD, WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:23.150 --> 01:24.251
(cocks gun)

01:29.456 --> 01:32.626
-SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
-WELL, FROM WHAT
I'VE READ SO FAR,

01:32.659 --> 01:35.462
IT IS A BOOK ABOUT MAN
WITH TWO FAMILIES,

01:35.496 --> 01:38.331
BECAUSE HE'S A SPY
FIGHTING COMMUNISTS

01:38.365 --> 01:39.500
AT THE TAIL END
OF THE COLD WAR.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.569
BOTH FAMILIES
ARE JUST LIKE US.

01:42.569 --> 01:43.704
APRIL, THERE ARE
PARTS OF THIS BOOK

01:43.736 --> 01:46.206
THAT ARE RIPPED DIRECTLY
FROM MY CHILDHOOD,

01:46.240 --> 01:49.310
LIKE WHEN
THE CHARACTER GOES TO VISIT
HIS "OBLIGATION DOWN SOUTH,"

01:49.343 --> 01:50.777
HE BRINGS HER
AN OLD RECORD--

01:50.811 --> 01:52.680
EXACTLY AS HE USED
TO DO FOR ME.

01:52.712 --> 01:54.747
-TIMOTHY CARSON IS OUR DAD.
-OKAY, OKAY,

01:54.781 --> 01:56.817
MAYBE THERE ARE
SOME SIMILARITIES,

01:56.850 --> 01:59.520
BUT... LAST TIME I CHECKED,
NOBODY GOT SHOT IN MY HOUSE.

01:59.552 --> 02:01.688
AND THE FIRST LINE
OF THE BOOK IS

02:01.721 --> 02:04.792
"THIS IS A STORY
ABOUT HOW I LIVED MY LIFE
AND PLANNED MY DEATH."

02:04.825 --> 02:08.596
DAD DIED IN A CAR ACCIDENT.
HOW DOES TIMOTHY CARSON DIE?

02:08.628 --> 02:11.331
THE BOOK STOPS MID-SENTENCE.
IT'S NOT FINISHED.

02:12.399 --> 02:14.435
NATALIE, MAYBE YOU'RE
MISUNDERSTANDING SOME OF--

02:14.467 --> 02:16.603
SO NOW YOU'RE QUESTIONING
MY READING COMPREHENSION?

02:16.637 --> 02:17.771
NO.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.740
I JUST THINK
THAT YOU MIGHT BE TRYING

02:19.772 --> 02:22.575
TO TURN THIS
INTO SOMETHING
THAT IT ISN'T.

02:22.610 --> 02:25.812
THERE'S NO WAY
OUR DAD IS THIS CHARACTER.
IT'S JUST FICTION.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.781
WE ALL SUFFERED
FROM DAD'S LIE,

02:27.814 --> 02:30.384
AND YOU DEFINITELY GOT
THE WORST OF IT,

02:30.417 --> 02:32.752
BUT I THINK HE WAS
JUST TRYING HIS BEST
TO MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.555
OKAY, YEAH,
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT...

02:34.587 --> 02:36.356
BEFORE THIS BOOK.

02:36.389 --> 02:37.525
BUT NOW THAT I'VE READ IT,

02:37.557 --> 02:39.225
I'VE LEARNED ALL
THE MANIPULATIVE STUFF

02:39.259 --> 02:41.562
HE HAD TO DO TO TRY
TO COVER HIS TRACKS
FOR TWO DECADES--

02:41.594 --> 02:44.430
THE SECRET CREDIT CARDS,
THE PAYING OFF BOTH FAMILIES

02:44.465 --> 02:46.901
WITH MONEY
AND GIFTS TO MAKE SURE
WE STAYED OBLIVIOUS.

02:48.401 --> 02:50.204
JUST... KEEP READING.

02:54.508 --> 02:57.645

03:14.694 --> 03:16.563
April: SO, YOU'LL START
AT THE ALTAR,

03:16.597 --> 03:18.799
THEN THE BRIDESMAIDS WILL
COME DOWN WITH THE GROOMSMEN,

03:18.831 --> 03:20.466
AND THEN I'LL COME DOWN.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.635
WAIT. WHO-- WHO'S WALKING YOU
DOWN THE AISLE?

03:22.670 --> 03:25.772
OH. I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE MY MOM...

03:25.806 --> 03:27.240
OR UNCLE GEORGE.

03:28.241 --> 03:29.610
LET'S SIDEBAR THAT.

03:29.643 --> 03:32.513
I GET THERE, AND THEN
THE AWAKENING  PASSAGE IS READ.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.814
OKAY, WE CAN'T HAVE A READING
FROM THAT BOOK AT OUR WEDDING.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.584
KATE CHOPIN'S WORDS
ARE BEAUTIFUL

03:36.616 --> 03:38.819
"THE VOICE OF THE SEA
SPEAKS TO THE SOUL"?

03:38.852 --> 03:40.721
YEAH, WELL, HER MAIN CHARACTER
ENDS UP KILLING HERSELF

03:40.753 --> 03:41.989
IN THAT SCENE. NO WAY.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.456
OKAY, WELL, WE CAN'T HAVE

03:43.490 --> 03:44.724
SAVAGE GARDEN LYRICS READ
AT OUR WEDDING EITHER.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.293
WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAINST
SAVAGE GARDEN?

03:46.326 --> 03:47.760
YOU'RE TRYING TO BE IRONIC,
AND IRONY DOESN'T WORK

03:47.795 --> 03:48.962
WITH A TRADITIONAL
WEDDING CEREMONY.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.663
OKAY, WE HAVE A PROBLEM,
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT

03:50.698 --> 03:51.865
THIS THING
TO BE A SNOOZEFEST.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.667
THE CEREMONY'S GOTTA BE...
(snaps fingers)

03:53.700 --> 03:55.603
-SHORT AND SWEET.
-MY VOWS AREN'T EVEN
GONNA BE SHORT AND SWEET.

03:55.635 --> 03:57.236
-WE'RE WRITING OUR OWN VOWS?
-(door closes)

03:57.271 --> 03:58.872
-ARE YOU...
-HEY, GUYS.

04:01.008 --> 04:03.009
-EVERYTHING OKAY?
-MM-HMM.

04:03.242 --> 04:04.677
I DON'T KNOW! WHY DON'T YOU ASK

04:04.711 --> 04:05.913
MR. CHICA CHERRY COLA
OVER HERE.

04:05.945 --> 04:07.814
OKAY, I AM SORRY
THAT SAVAGE GARDEN

04:07.848 --> 04:09.782
WAS THE SEMINAL BAND
OF MY YOUTH.

04:09.817 --> 04:13.319
CLEARLY YOU GUYS ARE UNDER
A LOT OF WEDDING STRESS.

04:13.353 --> 04:15.688
YOU'RE CURATING THE CEREMONY,
ARRANGING THE SEATING CHARTS,

04:15.723 --> 04:17.690
NOT TO MENTION FIGURING OUT
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA WEAR.

04:17.725 --> 04:18.959
HEY, AT LEAST I GOT
MY TUX ALREADY.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.894
-SHE STILL DOESN'T
HAVE A DRESS.
-OH MY GOD!

04:20.927 --> 04:22.562
-(whispers) YOU DON'T.
-WHENEVER I HAVE

04:22.596 --> 04:23.896
AN ENGAGED COUPLE COME IN
TO SEE ME--

04:23.930 --> 04:25.598
MOM, IT'S OKAY. YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SHRINK US.

04:25.632 --> 04:27.668
NO, NO, I'M JUST--
I WANNA PROVIDE YOU GUYS

04:27.701 --> 04:30.670
WITH SOME TOOLS TO HELP
YOU COMMUNICATE BETTER.

04:30.704 --> 04:33.340
IT'S IMPORTANT TO LEARN HOW
TO DEAL WITH THE SMALLER ISSUES

04:33.374 --> 04:34.507
BEFORE THE BIGGER ONES
COME ALONG.

04:34.540 --> 04:35.942
THAT WAY YOU'RE PREPARED.

04:35.975 --> 04:37.478
THERE'S A QUESTIONNAIRE

04:37.511 --> 04:39.413
THAT WAS CREATED
BY SOME PSYCHOLOGISTS

04:39.446 --> 04:41.581
TO HELP GAIN A BETTER
UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR PARTNER.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.550
IT'S CALLED
"THE EXPERIMENTAL GENERATION

04:43.584 --> 04:45.485
OF INTERPERSONAL CLOSENESS."

04:46.487 --> 04:48.588
YOU TWO HAVEN'T BEEN
TOGETHER THAT LONG.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.956
I'M SURE THERE'S SOME THINGS

04:49.990 --> 04:52.625
YOU COULD STILL LEARN
ABOUT ONE ANOTHER.

04:54.293 --> 04:55.428
(chuckles)

04:59.699 --> 05:03.569
-(both laughing)
-BUT NOW I HAVE
SO MANY OPTIONS,

05:03.603 --> 05:05.471
I COULD WEAR
PRACTICALLY ANYTHING.

05:05.505 --> 05:07.040
YEAH, UPSIDE TO PUBLIC SCHOOL.

05:07.074 --> 05:09.776
-IT'S STRESSING ME OUT.
-YOU WILL BE FINE.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.846
YEAH, SCHOOL IS SCHOOL.

05:12.879 --> 05:14.848
WHATEVER.

05:14.882 --> 05:17.550
I'M GLAD THAT WE'RE HAVING
FUN TONIGHT, THOUGH.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.687
ME TOO.

05:20.721 --> 05:23.757
MARGO!
WHAT A COINCIDENCE!

05:23.790 --> 05:25.526
JULIET, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

05:25.559 --> 05:28.696
(sighs) I AM PUB HOPPING.

05:28.728 --> 05:30.531
ALONE?

05:30.564 --> 05:33.332
WELL, WHO ELSE AM I GONNA
GO WITH SINCE WE BROKE UP?

05:33.367 --> 05:37.370
-WAIT, THIS IS YOUR EX?
-BRENNA, MEET JULIET.

05:37.403 --> 05:41.074
YOU... HAVE SUCH
A YOUTHFUL GLOW.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.810
NO BAGS UNDER YOUR EYES.
LA MER?

05:43.843 --> 05:46.947
ESTEE LAUDER? LA PRAIRIE?

05:46.980 --> 05:49.716
UM, AVEENO, I THINK.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.619
JULIET IS THIRSTY.
GARCON?

05:52.653 --> 05:56.590
JULIET HAS HAD ENOUGH.
I AM GOING TO TAKE
HER DRUNK ASS HOME.

05:56.622 --> 05:58.992
-BUT IT'S A CUTE
DRUNK ASS, RIGHT?
-(chuckles nervously)

05:59.026 --> 06:03.062
ARE WE STILL ON
FOR THAT NICOLE HOLOFCENER
MOVIE MARATHON AT THE BRATTLE?

06:03.096 --> 06:04.098
OOH.

06:05.432 --> 06:08.367
GOOD. I PROMISE
IT WILL BE LESS DISTRACTING.

06:08.401 --> 06:10.737
-OKAY, YOU'RE GOOD. YES.
-MMM. MMM!

06:10.771 --> 06:13.606
-THE BEST FRIES.
-YEAH. COME ON.

06:31.658 --> 06:33.627
April's voice:
AS THE WEEKS WENT BY,

06:33.659 --> 06:35.795
SO DID THE GRIEVING
FOR GRANDMA IDA.

06:36.797 --> 06:39.699
THE NARRAGANSETT SUN PEEKED
THROUGH THE BLINDS,

06:39.733 --> 06:42.569
CASTING AN APRICOT GLOW
AROUND THE ROOM

06:42.603 --> 06:44.605
AS I GOT READY
FOR MY NEXT TRIP.

06:51.478 --> 06:54.113
-HEY, SWEETIE.
-April's voice:  AS I WENT
TO HIDE MY .45,

06:54.148 --> 06:56.682
I REMEMBERED...
THAT SECRET WAS OUT.

06:56.716 --> 06:58.985
WHY ARE YOU BRINGING
A HOLLIES RECORD WITH YOU
ON YOUR TRIP?

07:00.052 --> 07:03.723
A SECRETARY AT LANGLEY
LIKES BRITISH ROCK
FROM THE '60s,

07:03.757 --> 07:05.858
SO I THOUGHT
IT'D BE NICE.
(chuckles)

07:05.892 --> 07:07.961
April's voice:
THE RECORD WAS FOR LISA,

07:07.995 --> 07:09.963
HER HALF-SISTER
SHE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT.

07:09.997 --> 07:12.966
IT WAS A MATERIAL OBJECT
TO MAKE HER FEEL LOVED.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.470
PERHAPS FRETTING
OVER MY FABRICATIONS WAS
THE LEAST OF MY PROBLEMS,

07:16.502 --> 07:19.572
SINCE EVERYONE AROUND ME
WAS JUST SO EASY TO DECEIVE.

07:19.605 --> 07:21.975
SO, DAD...

07:22.009 --> 07:25.012
EVER SINCE WE FOUND OUT
ABOUT YOU BEING IN THE C.I.A.,

07:25.045 --> 07:27.047
I TOLD YOU, HONEY,
THE FAMILY'S SAFE.

07:27.079 --> 07:29.716
WHAT HAPPENED
THE OTHER DAY WAS JUST
AN ISOLATED THING. IT JUST--

07:29.750 --> 07:31.651
NO, IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.

07:31.685 --> 07:34.153
A C.I.A. AGENT IS
INCREDIBLY NOBLE WORK,

07:34.187 --> 07:35.956
ESPECIALLY IN TODAY'S WORLD,

07:35.988 --> 07:37.858
AND I WANT TO DO IT.

07:37.891 --> 07:40.627
I WANNA FOLLOW
IN YOUR FOOTSTEPS
AND BECOME A SPY.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.196
I'VE EVEN DONE
SOME RESEARCH.

07:42.228 --> 07:44.630
April's voice:
I COULDN'T BELIEVE
MY DAUGHTER'S AUDACITY.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.800
HAD I INFLATED HER ID
SO TREMENDOUSLY,

07:46.834 --> 07:49.802
SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD
WHAT IT TOOK TO BE ME?

07:51.103 --> 07:53.906
ROSE... I JUST DON'T
THINK YOU HAVE IT IN YOU

07:53.941 --> 07:55.709
TO DO THE JOB
THAT I DO, SWEETIE.

07:57.110 --> 07:59.512
April's voice:
ROSE'S DESPAIR WAS PALPABLE.

07:59.545 --> 08:01.747
MAYBE I WAS TOO HARSH.

08:03.716 --> 08:05.685
THERE ARE OTHER JOBS
WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION

08:05.718 --> 08:07.521
THAT YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT FOR,

08:07.553 --> 08:09.021
PERHAPS AN ANALYST.

08:09.055 --> 08:12.925
IT'S A DESK JOB,
BUT YOU'D GET TO USE
THAT BRIGHT BRAIN OF YOURS.

08:12.959 --> 08:16.529
April's voice:  I COULD SEE
THE WHEELS IN ROSE'S HEAD
BEGINNING TO TURN,

08:16.562 --> 08:18.632
LIKE A TRAIN
LEAVING THE STATION,

08:18.665 --> 08:19.932
BYE, SWEETIE.

08:19.966 --> 08:21.701
April's voice:
IT WAS OBVIOUS,
IN THAT MOMENT,

08:21.735 --> 08:24.637
ROSE WAS IMAGINING
HER LIFE AS A C.I.A. ANALYST.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.740
NOT HER DREAM,

08:26.773 --> 08:27.875
BUT A JOB.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.908
-OH.
-NOW YOU SEE WHAT
I'M DEALING WITH?

09:00.941 --> 09:04.110
YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY SAY ABOUT A GUY
WITH A GIANT PET SNAKE?

09:04.144 --> 09:06.779
-HE'S A LOSER.
-OH, WELL, THEY'RE ALL LOSERS.

09:06.812 --> 09:10.850
-WHO ARE ALL LOSERS?
-OH, THE MEN I'VE MET
ON THIS DATING APP.

09:10.884 --> 09:14.587
THE OTHER NIGHT I HAD
A DATE WITH A GUY WHO WAS
A PAUL REVERE LIVING STATUE.

09:14.620 --> 09:17.224
HE CAME STRAIGHT FROM WORK.
THINK ABOUT THAT.

09:17.256 --> 09:19.692
ARE YOU SURE IT'S NOT
A BIG DEAL THAT GRAHAM'S
COMING TO THE WEDDING?

09:19.725 --> 09:23.062
WHAT? NO!
(laughs)

09:23.096 --> 09:26.667
I KNOW YOU SAID
YOU'RE OKAY THAT DOMINIC'S
BRINGING MRS. PLUS-ONE, BUT--

09:26.700 --> 09:29.201
HEY, I AM TOTALLY FINE
WITH IT, OKAY?

09:29.235 --> 09:31.804
THAT BEING SAID,
IT WOULDN'T HURT
TO HAVE A HOT GUY--

09:31.837 --> 09:33.706
PREFERABLY ONE WHO'S
NOT A SERIAL KILLER--

09:33.740 --> 09:36.109
ON MY ARM TO SHOW
THAT WARBY-PARKER
BESPECTACLED PESCATARIAN

09:36.143 --> 09:37.778
THAT I HAVE MOVED ON.

09:37.811 --> 09:41.748
Sara:
I KNEW THERE WAS A REASON
I SAVED THIS ALL THESE YEARS!

09:41.782 --> 09:44.051
OKAY, SO,
WE WERE THINKING

09:44.084 --> 09:45.751
THAT SINCE YOU'RE
STILL DRESS-LESS,

09:45.786 --> 09:47.988
MAYBE YOU COULD WEAR THIS.

09:48.020 --> 09:50.724
BETH SAID SHE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO DO SOME ALTERATIONS.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.326
AND...

09:54.860 --> 09:58.030
OH GAH...
I HAD NO IDEA.

09:58.065 --> 10:01.835
WOW. OH.
MOM, IT'S...

10:01.868 --> 10:04.370
WOW. WOW.

10:04.604 --> 10:09.076
-NOT TOO DATED, RIGHT?
-THAT DRESS IS THE WORST THING
I HAVE EVER SEEN,

10:09.109 --> 10:12.778
-AND YOU WERE A C-SECTION.
-I'M OFFICIALLY IN PANIC MODE.

10:12.812 --> 10:14.380
WELL, THERE'S STILL MY DRESS.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.149
MOM, IF MY DRESS FROM THE '80s
ISN'T GONNA WORK,

10:17.183 --> 10:19.152
I HARDLY THINK
YOURS IS ANY BETTER.

10:19.186 --> 10:20.721
HEY, HEY, HEY,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.755
I'M SURE THAT I CAN
WORK MY MAGIC...

10:22.788 --> 10:24.825
-YEAH.
-...AND TURN IT
INTO SOMETHING

10:24.857 --> 10:26.927
A LITTLE...
LESS RETRO.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.761
LET ME HELP YOU
DOWN THE STAIRS,

10:28.794 --> 10:31.697
-BECAUSE DEATH
BY THIS DRESS...
-OKAY.

10:31.731 --> 10:34.634
...WOULD BE TRAGIC
ON SO MANY LEVELS.

10:37.336 --> 10:40.407
SO, I'M GUESSING YOU DON'T
WANT THE MATCHING HAT.

10:40.639 --> 10:43.243
(laughs)
WAIT, MOM.

10:43.275 --> 10:45.144
I KNOW WE'VE ALREADY
SENT OUT THE INVITATIONS,

10:45.177 --> 10:49.149
BUT I REALIZED
WE DIDN'T INVITE ANY
OF DAD'S OLD FRIENDS.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.150
DO YOU THINK HE'D WANT
ANY OF THEM AT THE WEDDING?

10:51.183 --> 10:54.721
HMM. NEIL, HIS ROOMMATE
AT HAMPSHIRE.

10:54.754 --> 10:56.655
I GUESS I COULD DIG UP
HIS ADDRESS SOMEWHERE.

10:56.690 --> 10:58.924
OR, LIKE, EDWIN SHAW.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.961
I HAVEN'T HEARD
THAT NAME IN A LONG TIME.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.696
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE HE IS.

11:02.729 --> 11:04.264
IT'S LIKE HE FELL OFF
THE FACE OF THE PLANET.

11:04.297 --> 11:05.765
I EVEN TRIED
TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HIM

11:05.798 --> 11:08.100
ABOUT YOUR DAD'S FUNERAL.
I NEVER HEARD BACK.

11:08.134 --> 11:10.703
IT'S A REAL SHAME.

11:14.908 --> 11:17.110
EDWIN D. SHAW.

11:28.788 --> 11:31.792
SO, YOU WANT TO TACKLE
THIS QUESTIONNAIRE?

11:34.827 --> 11:38.197
WHAT IF WE WENT AWAY
TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS?

11:38.230 --> 11:42.903
-A CHANGE
OF SCENERY MIGHT BE NICE.
-WELL, I DO LOVE HOTELS,

11:42.936 --> 11:46.139
AND ALL THE THINGS THAT
YOU CAN DO IN THOSE HOTELS.

11:46.173 --> 11:49.209
-(chuckles) I MEAN SEX.
-OH. (chuckles)

11:49.241 --> 11:52.979
WELL, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO STAY AT THE FEDERAL
IN PROVIDENCE.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.481
WELL, LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOING
TO GET INTIMATE AT THE FEDERAL.

11:55.715 --> 11:59.186
-HMM! YOU MEAN SEX?
-MM-HMM. MMM.

12:16.470 --> 12:19.239
ARE YOU THE GIRL THAT JUST
TRANSFERRED FROM CHARTON?

12:19.272 --> 12:23.777
-UMM, YEAH.
-I CAN'T EVEN--
THAT IS BEYOND AMAZING.

12:23.809 --> 12:25.479
I'M OBSESSED
WITH PRIVATE SCHOOL CULTURE.

12:25.511 --> 12:28.782
GUYS WEARING TIES
TO SCHOOL, IT'S SO HOT.

12:28.815 --> 12:30.417
I'M SYDNEY.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.288
THE SICK KID?
HIS NAME'S FINN.

12:36.322 --> 12:39.292
HE HAS CANCER
AND ONLY ONE LEG.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.394
ISN'T THAT LIKE
THE SADDEST THING EVER?

12:41.427 --> 12:44.063
HE'S ONLY HERE PART-TIME,
BECAUSE HE'S STILL SO SICK,

12:44.096 --> 12:47.334
AND I HEAR THAT
HE HAS TO WEAR
THAT FACE MASK AT ALL TIMES,

12:47.366 --> 12:51.538
WHICH I'M SO CONFUSED BY.
I MEAN, THEY DIDN'T WEAR MASKS
IN  THE FAULT IN OUR STARS.

12:52.538 --> 12:55.207
-RIGHT.
-SO I HAVE A  HARPER'S BAZAAR.

12:55.241 --> 12:57.510
I SUBSCRIBE.
DO YOU WANT TO SIT TOGETHER
AND GO THROUGH IT WITH ME?

12:57.543 --> 13:00.246
CUT OUT SOME STUFF
FOR OUR VISION BOARD?

13:00.279 --> 13:01.380
NO THANKS.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.490
(cell phone clicking)

13:18.298 --> 13:19.865
(cell phone buzzes)

13:31.811 --> 13:34.313
-HOW LONG HAVE
WE BEEN DOING THIS?
-SHH! IT'S BEEN LIKE ONE MINUTE.

13:34.346 --> 13:37.017
THAT'S IT? I THOUGHT
WE WERE JUST SUPPOSED
TO BE ANSWERING QUESTIONS.

13:37.049 --> 13:39.818
WELL, THEY ALSO SUGGEST
KEEPING EYE CONTACT
FOR FOUR MINUTES

13:39.852 --> 13:42.455
TO IMPROVE INTIMACY.
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S WEIRD.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.290
-LET'S JUST DO THE QUESTIONS.
-OH, THANK GOD.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.493
OKAY, LET'S SEE. UM...

13:46.525 --> 13:49.495
"DO YOU HAVE A SECRET HUNCH
ABOUT HOW YOU WILL DIE?"

13:49.528 --> 13:52.532
REALLY? WOW.
WELL, THIS IS GONNA BE...

13:52.566 --> 13:55.368
A BIT OF A STRETCH,

13:55.402 --> 13:56.970
-SO BEAR WITH ME HERE.
-OKAY.

13:57.003 --> 13:59.505
-CANCER.
-ALL RIGHT, YOUR TURN.

13:59.538 --> 14:01.474
(both clear throat)

14:01.508 --> 14:03.876
"WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE FAMOUS?
IN WHAT WAY?"

14:03.909 --> 14:07.547
EXCUSE ME,
I ALREADY AM FAMOUS, OKAY?

14:07.581 --> 14:09.349
I SEIZED
ON LOCAL TELEVISION.

14:09.381 --> 14:13.385
I WAS
A WIDELY TWEETED GIF.
I TRENDED NATIONWIDE.

14:13.419 --> 14:16.456
YOU KNOW, IT'S A MIRACLE
I AM STILL SO HUMBLE.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.591
-(clears throat)
-(laughs)

14:18.625 --> 14:20.961
MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE THIS
A LITTLE MORE SERIOUSLY.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.528
-OKAY.
-OKAY.

14:23.963 --> 14:26.533
"WHAT IS YOUR
MOST TERRIBLE MEMORY?"

14:26.566 --> 14:30.336
-AND IT CAN'T BE CANCER-RELATED.
-OOH, GAME CHANGER.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.438
I LIKE THAT.
LET ME THINK ABOUT IT.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.476
OKAY, THERE WAS
THIS ONE TIME AT EXETER,

14:37.509 --> 14:42.448
I MISSED CURFEW,
AND THE DEAN MADE ME CLEAN
THE JUNIOR BOYS' BATHROOM.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.620
-YEAH.
-THAT'S YOUR MOST
TERRIBLE MEMORY?

14:46.653 --> 14:49.154
16-YEAR-OLD BOYS
ARE DISGUSTING.

14:49.188 --> 14:51.323
-DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
THE AMOUNT OF RAW--
-NO NO, NO NO.

14:51.357 --> 14:52.392
-LET'S MOVE ON.
-MM-HMM.

14:52.424 --> 14:53.592
-HERE YOU GO.
-OKAY.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.461
LET'S SEE HERE.
(clears throat)

14:56.895 --> 14:59.899
"IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU'VE DREAMED OF DOING
FOR A LONG TIME?

14:59.932 --> 15:01.433
"WHY HAVEN'T YOU DONE IT?"

15:06.472 --> 15:10.509
I'VE DREAMED
OF HAVING SEX WITH MY FIANCEE
EVER SINCE WE GOT OFF I-95.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.611
AND WHY HAVEN'T YOU DONE IT?

15:12.645 --> 15:14.913
-I HAVE NO IDEA.
-OH MY GOD.

15:18.284 --> 15:20.287
-April: SO MANY PILLOWS!
-(Leo laughs)

15:23.355 --> 15:25.292
(April laughs)
NO...

15:25.325 --> 15:27.326
-HOO!
-(laughs)

15:27.360 --> 15:29.328
THAT WAS A MUCH BETTER USE
OF FOUR MINUTES.

15:29.361 --> 15:31.063
-FOUR?
-MM-HMM.

15:31.096 --> 15:34.100
RUDE!
THAT WAS AT LEAST FIVE.

15:34.134 --> 15:36.602
(clears throat) MWAH!

15:36.635 --> 15:39.139
-(sighs)
-SO, ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

15:41.441 --> 15:43.375
-CAN WE GET BACK
TO THAT LATER?
-MM-HMM.

15:43.409 --> 15:46.078
I REALLY WANT TO CHECK OUT
THE MIKE KELLEY EXHIBIT
AT THE RISD MUSEUM FOR A BIT.

15:46.111 --> 15:48.615
I KNOW YOU DON'T
LIKE SEEING STUFFED
ANIMALS AS ART, SO...

15:48.648 --> 15:52.686
YUCK. HAVE FUN.
I THINK I'M GONNA GET
A BURGER AT HARRY'S.

15:52.719 --> 15:55.621
I WENT THERE A LOT WHEN I DID
MY PRE-COLLEGE PROGRAM AT BROWN.

15:55.654 --> 15:56.956
-AND, YES...
-WHAT?

15:56.990 --> 15:59.259
...I DID A PRE-COLLEGE
PROGRAM AT BROWN.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.594
OKAY. I'M GONNA GET READY.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.464
OH! WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

16:15.607 --> 16:17.009
EXCUSE ME.
MR. SHAW?

16:18.177 --> 16:20.346
YOU ARE
THREE MINUTES LATE.

16:20.379 --> 16:23.115
I HATE LATECOMERS.
TAKE A SEAT.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.985
I'M SORRY.
I'M... ISABELLE,

16:26.019 --> 16:28.587
AND I WANTED TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUICK QUESTIONS
ABOUT YOUR PROCESS.

16:28.620 --> 16:31.990
WELL, THE SEMINAR'S
ABOUT TO BEGIN AND I DON'T
OFFER ONE-ON-ONE TIME.

16:33.559 --> 16:36.428
BUT FOR YOU,
I COULD MAKE AN EXCEPTION.

16:36.462 --> 16:38.764
HOTEL BAR,
SAY, SEVEN O'CLOCK?

16:38.998 --> 16:40.432
-GREAT.
-(chuckles)

16:40.466 --> 16:42.634
-THANK YOU.
-YES. YOU'RE NOT STAYING?

16:44.370 --> 16:46.438
HELLO, HELLO, EVERYONE,
AND WELCOME.

16:46.472 --> 16:49.576
(clears throat)
AND NOW TO BEGIN,
I WOULD LIKE TO TALK

16:49.609 --> 16:53.645
ABOUT E.M. FORSTER
WHOSE FAMOUS WORDS WERE
"ONLY CONNECT."

16:53.679 --> 16:56.316
THAT'S WHAT
WE DO AS WRITERS,
WE CONNECT.

16:56.349 --> 16:59.085
AND HOW DO WE DO THAT?
BY SHARING SECRETS.

16:59.119 --> 17:02.589
WE OPEN OUR VEINS
AND LET THE BLOOD
POUR ONTO THE PAGE.

17:10.096 --> 17:14.534
-SARA? IS THAT YOU?
-OH MY GOSH!

17:14.567 --> 17:17.636
-BILLY CONTI! GOD!
-(laughs)

17:17.670 --> 17:21.441
-VAN BUREN HIGH SCHOOL.
HOW ARE YOU?
-OH! MY GOD.

17:21.473 --> 17:26.078
-WHAT HAS IT BEEN, 30 YEARS?
-NO, DON'T-- DON'T REMIND ME.

17:26.112 --> 17:31.417
NOBODY CALLS ME BILLY.
WILLIAM. I HAVEN'T BEEN
CALLED BILLY SINCE...

17:31.451 --> 17:34.386
-I CAME OUT IN COLLEGE.
-YOU'RE GAY.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.556
-VERY.
-I PROBABLY SHOULD'VE KNOWN.

17:36.588 --> 17:40.593
-I THOUGHT YOU KNEW.
-WELL, WE WENT TO, WHAT,
FIVE ABBA CONCERTS.

17:40.626 --> 17:42.394
-I LOVE ABBA.
-I KNOW.

17:43.430 --> 17:46.432
SO, TELL ME--
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

17:46.465 --> 17:49.568
I'M THE HEAD CREATIVE DIRECTOR
AT MY GRAPHIC DESIGN FIRM.

17:49.602 --> 17:53.472
MY SON GRADUATED
FROM NORTHWESTERN IN JUNE.

17:53.506 --> 17:57.477
I JUST GOT BACK
FROM A SAFARI
IN SOUTH AFRICA.

17:57.509 --> 18:00.480
SO, HOW ABOUT--
HOW ABOUT YOU?

18:00.512 --> 18:02.382
THINGS ARE WONDERFUL.
REALLY.

18:02.414 --> 18:06.486
MY OLDER DAUGHTER
IS GETTING MARRIED
IN A FEW WEEKS

18:06.519 --> 18:09.521
-TO LEO HENDRIE,
BRUCE'S SON.
-WOW.

18:09.556 --> 18:12.826
AND MY YOUNGER DAUGHTER
JUST FINISHED HER FIRST
SHORT FILM.

18:12.858 --> 18:16.229
THAT'S GREAT YOU-- MMM!
YOU HAVE IT ALL FIGURED OUT.

18:16.261 --> 18:18.631
-IT'S SO GREAT TO SEE YOU.
-I'M SORRY. (chuckles)

18:18.664 --> 18:21.201
I-- I DON'T WANT
TO LIE TO YOU,

18:21.233 --> 18:25.371
BUT MY OLDER DAUGHTER IS
GETTING MARRIED, BUT IT'S
ONLY BECAUSE SHE HAS LEUKEMIA,

18:25.404 --> 18:27.673
AND MY YOUNGER DAUGHTER,
I JUST HAD TO PUT HER
INTO PUBLIC SCHOOL,

18:27.707 --> 18:30.576
BECAUSE I JUST
HAD TO CONCEDE THAT
I CANNOT AFFORD PRIVATE.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.545
OH, AND MY HUSBAND DIED,

18:32.578 --> 18:34.480
AND I FOUND OUT,
CRAZILY ENOUGH,

18:34.513 --> 18:37.483
AFTER HE PASSED AWAY
THAT HE HAS A SECRET FAMILY
LIVING DOWN IN FLORIDA.

18:38.484 --> 18:41.520
YOU KNOW WHAT?
SORRY TO HAVE UNLOADED
THAT ON YOU, BILLY--

18:41.554 --> 18:45.391
-WILLIAM.
-NO, NO, NO, NO.
THAT'S-- THAT'S--

18:46.425 --> 18:51.564
WOW. (clears throat)
I MAY HAVE EXAGGERATED...

18:51.597 --> 18:53.900
A BIT. I--

18:54.133 --> 18:59.471
I JUST WENT ON SAFARI,
BECAUSE MY DIVORCE WAS
RECENTLY FINALIZED.

18:59.506 --> 19:04.210
MY HUSBAND LEFT ME
FOR A 20-YEAR-OLD TWINK.

19:04.243 --> 19:05.511
YOU KNOW?

19:06.546 --> 19:08.480
-OH.
-(chuckles)

19:08.515 --> 19:09.715
-SO...
-I KNOW.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.917
-I SUPPOSE LIFE CAN
BE A BITCH, HUH?
-YEAH.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.653
WELL, ESPECIALLY
WHEN THAT BITCH

19:14.686 --> 19:18.525
IS A HAIRLESS YOUNG MAN
NAMED TRISTAN WHO WAS
BORN IN THE 1990s.

19:18.557 --> 19:19.726
-OH NO.
-YEAH. (laughs)

19:19.759 --> 19:21.693
-(laughs)
-(mutters)

19:23.529 --> 19:26.566
-WELL, CAN WE
CATCH UP SOME MORE?
-YES, YES! YES!

19:26.598 --> 19:29.635
-WHAT ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT?
-OH! ACTUALLY, TONIGHT,

19:29.669 --> 19:32.271
MY GAY MEN'S RUNNING CLUB
IS HAVING A MEET-UP HERE,

19:32.305 --> 19:34.574
BUT YOU SHOULD COME.
NO, NO, YOU SHOULD COME,
YOU SHOULD COME.

19:34.606 --> 19:37.442
IT'S SO MUCH MORE FUN...
THAN IT SOUNDS.

19:37.477 --> 19:39.645
EVERY GET-TOGETHER ENDS
IN AN ABBA SING-ALONG.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.314
-REALLY?
-YES.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.650
OKAY. WELL,
SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.218
NO. LET'S EXCHANGE--

19:45.250 --> 19:47.787
-YEAH, YEAH, OKAY.
-YEAH. HERE, I'VE GOT...

19:48.887 --> 19:51.257
DO YOU--
DO YOU BUMP?

19:51.290 --> 19:52.959
-UH, LET'S SEE.
-HERE.

19:54.192 --> 19:55.595
-NO.
-NO, YOU DON'T BUMP. OKAY.

19:55.627 --> 19:56.962
(lock beeping)

19:59.766 --> 20:02.634
HEY! HOW--
HOW WAS YOUR BURGER?

20:02.669 --> 20:04.336
AWESOME.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.204
BUT YOU KNOW,
WHAT WASN'T AWESOME WAS

20:06.239 --> 20:09.375
GOING TO
THE RISD MUSEUM TO FIND YOU,
AND YOU WEREN'T THERE.

20:09.409 --> 20:14.446
-WHERE WERE YOU?
-CAN WE JUST GO INSIDE FIRST?
DO YOU HAVE YOUR CARD?

20:15.847 --> 20:20.553
OKAY. NATALIE FOUND
THIS UNPUBLISHED MANUSCRIPT
THAT OUR DAD WROTE,

20:20.586 --> 20:24.523
AND IT'S BASICALLY
A THINLY VEILED FICTIONAL
VERSION OF OUR FAMILY.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.558
AT FIRST I THOUGHT
SHE WAS CRAZY,

20:26.593 --> 20:30.496
BUT THEN I READ IT,
AND THERE ARE ACTUAL MOMENTS
FROM MY LIFE DRAMATIZED IN IT.

20:30.529 --> 20:32.765
WHAT DOES THIS
HAVE TO DO WITH YOU
NOT BEING AT THE MUSEUM?

20:32.798 --> 20:36.469
WELL, THE FRIEND
WHO WAS GIVING MY DAD
NOTES ON THE MANUSCRIPT

20:36.501 --> 20:39.638
IS TEACHING A SEMINAR HERE,
AND I THOUGHT I COULD ASK HIM
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.941
BUT WHEN I WENT
TO TALK TO HIM, I COULDN'T
GET ANY FACE TIME,

20:41.974 --> 20:44.743
-SO I HAVE TO MEET HIM
AT THE HOTEL BAR LATER.
-OKAY, SO OUR TRIP TO PROVIDENCE

20:44.777 --> 20:48.981
IS ACTUALLY ABOUT YOU
TRYING TO TRACK DOWN ONE
OF YOUR DAD'S OLD FRIENDS?

20:49.015 --> 20:51.651
LOOK, THIS BOOK--
THERE IS A PART THAT
IS EXACTLY LIKE

20:51.683 --> 20:54.621
THE TIME THAT I TOLD
MY DAD I WANTED TO BE
A NOVELIST JUST LIKE HE WAS,

20:54.653 --> 20:56.655
AND INSTEAD HE SUGGESTED
I GO INTO JOURNALISM.

20:56.689 --> 20:59.692
YOU THINK YOUR DAD'S
OLD FRIEND CAN TELL YOU...?

20:59.726 --> 21:01.693
I DON'T KNOW.
WITH THE WEDDING COMING UP,

21:01.728 --> 21:03.528
I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT
ABOUT MY DAD LATELY,

21:03.563 --> 21:06.031
AND READING THIS BOOK
HAS BEEN REALLY EYE-OPENING.

21:06.265 --> 21:09.769
THE NARRATOR IS
THIS NARCISSISTIC ANTI-HERO,

21:09.801 --> 21:12.838
BUT HE'S ALSO
A LOT LIKE MY DAD,
SO NOW I'M LIKE,

21:12.872 --> 21:15.708
WAS MY DAD
THIS BAD IN REAL LIFE
AS THIS NARRATOR IS?

21:15.741 --> 21:17.910
AND IF THAT ONE SCENE
WAS RIPPED DIRECTLY
FROM MY LIFE,

21:17.943 --> 21:19.645
IS EVERYTHING ELSE
IN THE BOOK TRUE?

21:19.679 --> 21:22.515
DID MY DAD PLAN
HIS OWN DEATH?
WAS HE A SPY?

21:22.548 --> 21:24.983
I HAVE NO IDEA!

21:25.018 --> 21:27.886
-I'M SORRY.
-WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST TELL ME THAT?

21:27.920 --> 21:31.657
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE
TO TALK TO EACH OTHER.

21:32.659 --> 21:36.362
I DIDN'T WANT TO BURDEN YOU
WITH MY CRAZY FAMILY STUFF.

21:36.395 --> 21:39.731
BUT YOUR FAMILY STUFF IS
GONNA BE MY FAMILY STUFF.

21:39.766 --> 21:42.669
AND WHILE I MIGHT NOT
UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING
ABOUT MARRIAGE,

21:42.701 --> 21:46.638
I THINK YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE ABLE TO TELL ANYTHING
TO YOUR SPOUSE,

21:46.673 --> 21:48.674
WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY...

21:48.708 --> 21:50.876
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE
NOT GOOD AT, BECAUSE...

21:50.910 --> 21:52.979
-I MEAN, COME ON,
US TRYING TO...
-(elevator dings)

21:53.011 --> 21:55.480
TAKE THAT QUESTIONNAIRE
SERIOUSLY WAS A DISASTER.

21:55.515 --> 21:57.450
OKAY, YOU CAN'T JUST
BLAME ME FOR THAT, THOUGH.

21:57.482 --> 21:59.018
YOU COULDN'T EVEN ANSWER
WHAT YOUR GREATEST DREAM IS.

21:59.051 --> 22:01.421
-I THOUGHT WE WERE
A COUPLE WHO SHARES.
-(shouts) LIKE YOU...

22:03.955 --> 22:06.558
LIKE YOU HONESTLY
SHARED WITH ME YOUR
MOST TERRIBLE MEMORY?

22:06.592 --> 22:09.061
-HEY, I TOLD YOU EXACTLY--
-OH, PLEASE, I DON'T
BELIEVE THAT.

22:09.095 --> 22:13.499
-THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING--
-OKAY, FINE! YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT MY MOST TERRIBLE MEMORY IS?

22:13.532 --> 22:17.103
IT'S THE TIME I GOT
SUPER DRUNK AND SLEPT WITH
MY BEST FRIEND'S GIRLFRIEND.

22:18.738 --> 22:19.806
HAPPY?

22:21.106 --> 22:23.710
-WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
-LAST TIME I CHECKED,

22:23.742 --> 22:25.478
WE DON'T HAVE TO
TELL EACH OTHER EVERYTHING.

22:35.555 --> 22:36.756
(sighs)
I TRIED TO ALTER IT,

22:36.788 --> 22:39.659
BUT IT'S JUST TOO... NICE.

22:40.859 --> 22:42.828
IT WAS VERY TRENDY
IN THE '80s,

22:42.862 --> 22:44.430
BUT I GUESS
YOU HAD TO BE THERE.

22:44.463 --> 22:46.566
DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED
ON THE SHOULDER PADS.

22:46.598 --> 22:49.568
I MEAN, WHAT KIND
OF A PSYCHOPATH THOUGHT THAT
THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA?

22:49.602 --> 22:51.938
I'M SORRY MY DRESS
MADE YOU SO ANGRY.

22:51.971 --> 22:55.708
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT
THE DRESS. I MEAN...

22:55.741 --> 22:59.077
JUST... I'M NEVER GONNA FIND
A DATE TO APRIL'S WEDDING.

22:59.112 --> 23:01.513
OH. WELL,
IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION,

23:01.547 --> 23:03.415
I'M GOING SOLO
TO THE WEDDING, TOO.

23:03.449 --> 23:06.085
I'M SO TIRED
OF ALL THESE AWFUL DATES

23:06.118 --> 23:07.619
WITH ALL THESE AWFUL MEN!

23:07.653 --> 23:09.922
THAT'S IT. I GIVE UP.

23:10.890 --> 23:14.160
OR MAYBE YOU JUST NEED
A NIGHT OFF FROM BEING ON.

23:14.393 --> 23:17.096
I'M HEADING OVER
TO THE CHARLES
IN A LITTLE BIT.

23:17.130 --> 23:19.397
I RAN INTO AN OLD FRIEND.
HE INVITED ME TO--

23:19.432 --> 23:22.934
-I'M OVER GUYS.
-NO, NO, HE'S GAY.

23:22.969 --> 23:26.571
THEY'RE ALL GAY.
IT'S A GAY MEN'S
RUNNING CLUB MEET-UP.

23:28.106 --> 23:30.643
WELL, I AM SOMEWHAT
OF A GAY ICON.

23:30.675 --> 23:33.578
OKAY. YEAH, LET'S DO IT.

23:33.613 --> 23:36.115
(gasps)
HIGH FIVE FOR US NOT HAVING
TO SHAVE OUR LEGS.

23:36.148 --> 23:39.417
-(laughs)
-YES. GREAT. OH MY GOD!

23:40.619 --> 23:42.721
(women laughing)

23:42.755 --> 23:45.090
I WANNA BE CATHERINE KEENER
WHEN I GROW UP.

23:45.124 --> 23:46.659
OH MAN, TOTALLY.

23:46.692 --> 23:48.760
SHE IS THE BEST ACTRESS
IN THE WORLD,

23:48.795 --> 23:51.596
AND SO AMAZING
IN ALL OF NICOLE'S MOVIES.

23:51.631 --> 23:52.932
IT'S LIKE SHE'S HER MUSE.

23:52.964 --> 23:54.967
EVERY GOOD ARTIST
NEEDS ONE.

23:58.871 --> 24:01.540
SO, HOW WAS JULIET?

24:01.574 --> 24:04.143
SHE'S A DRAMA QUEEN,

24:04.176 --> 24:06.479
BUT LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT HER.

24:06.511 --> 24:08.548
TONIGHT IS ABOUT YOU AND ME.

24:08.580 --> 24:11.717
AND AGAIN, I AM SORRY
WE COULDN'T GO BACK TO MY PLACE.

24:11.750 --> 24:14.086
MY LAZY LANDLORD
IS FINALLY FUMIGATING.

24:14.119 --> 24:17.589
IT'S OKAY. I JUST HOPE THAT
MY MOM DOESN'T COME HOME.

24:17.623 --> 24:20.692
OR ACTUALLY,
MAYBE I KIND OF DO.

24:20.726 --> 24:22.595
ME ON A DATE
WITH A 23-YEAR-OLD

24:22.627 --> 24:25.897
WOULD SO FREAK HER OUT,
AND I'M KIND OF IN THE MOOD
TO FREAK HER OUT.

24:32.137 --> 24:34.640
-(knocks on door)
-(gasps) OH MY GOD.

24:34.673 --> 24:36.541
WHAT IF THAT'S MY MOM?
WHAT IF SHE LEFT HER KEYS?

24:36.576 --> 24:38.644
-HIDE!
-I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T CARE.

24:44.083 --> 24:46.618
BRENNA, SWEETIE, HI.

24:46.652 --> 24:49.588
-UH...
-REALLY, JULIET?

24:49.622 --> 24:52.592
HOW DID YOU KNOW
THAT MARGO...?

24:52.625 --> 24:55.560
WE STILL FOLLOW EACH OTHER
ON PLACE MY PALS, OBVIOUSLY.

24:55.595 --> 24:58.931
AND GERTRUDE WANTED
TO SEE HER MOMMY.
SO CAN WE COME IN?

24:58.964 --> 25:01.267
LOOK AT THIS PLACE, HUH? HI.

25:07.707 --> 25:11.176
-MR. SHAW?
-AH. ISABELLE, YES?

25:11.210 --> 25:14.779
UM, SCOTCH FOR THE LADY, PLEASE.
I HOPE THAT'S OKAY.

25:14.814 --> 25:16.749
YEAH. MMM, SCOTCH.

25:17.950 --> 25:20.786
-(sighs)
-SO, THE ASSIGNMENT
THAT YOU GAVE TO US

25:20.819 --> 25:24.557
IN THE SEMINAR THIS AFTERNOON,
I FOUND IT SO INTERESTING--

25:24.589 --> 25:27.559
WRITING A STORY, ANY GENRE,
ABOUT LOSING YOUR KEYS.

25:27.593 --> 25:28.661
-(chuckles)
-I LOVED IT.

25:28.693 --> 25:30.162
AND I CAN'T WAIT TO READ IT.

25:30.195 --> 25:31.931
I HAVE TO ADMIT--
I'M STARSTRUCK.

25:31.963 --> 25:33.865
I'M SO FASCINATED
BY YOUR ENTIRE HISTORY--

25:33.900 --> 25:37.802
GROWING UP ON A FARM IN MAINE,
PAYING YOUR WAY THROUGH
COLLEGE AT BATES,

25:37.836 --> 25:40.006
AND, AS AN ASPIRING
WRITER MYSELF,

25:40.038 --> 25:42.240
HOW YOU HELD WORKSHOPS
WITH YOUR OTHER WRITER FRIENDS

25:42.275 --> 25:44.143
-TO HELP EDIT EACH OTHER.
-AH YES,

25:44.175 --> 25:46.045
OUR VERY OWN
BLOOMSBURY GROUP.

25:46.077 --> 25:48.780
(scoffs)
THOSE WERE
THE GOOD OLD DAYS...

25:48.814 --> 25:51.983
BEFORE EGO AND BOOK SALES
INTRUDED UPON THE FUN.

25:52.018 --> 25:54.619
WHAT IMPRESSIVE COMPANY,
I MEAN,

25:54.653 --> 25:57.722
-YOU AND THOMAS CARVER.
-(sighs)

25:57.757 --> 25:59.724
NOT TO SPEAK
ILL OF THE DEAD,
BUT THOMAS CARVER?

25:59.759 --> 26:03.261
-(laughs) WHAT AN ASS.
-I THOUGHT YOU TWO
WERE GOOD FRIENDS.

26:03.296 --> 26:05.564
OH, WELL, ONCE UPON A TIME.

26:05.597 --> 26:07.933
THOMAS AND I HAD EDITED
ALL OF EACH OTHER'S WRITING

26:07.967 --> 26:10.803
SINCE WE FIRST MET
AT THE TAM IN THE '80s...

26:10.836 --> 26:13.705
WHEN WE WERE BOTH
STARTING OUR CAREERS.

26:13.739 --> 26:16.608
YES, WE WERE BEST FRIENDS.
(humphs)

26:16.642 --> 26:19.045
BUT THE GUY WAS SHADY.

26:19.077 --> 26:22.347
GET THIS.
THOMAS HAD TWO FAMILIES--

26:22.580 --> 26:25.617
A LEGITIMATE ONE IN BOSTON,
A SECRET ONE IN FLORIDA

26:25.651 --> 26:27.118
HIS WIFE DIDN'T
EVEN KNOW ABOUT.

26:27.153 --> 26:29.989
HUH?
AND IT GETS WORSE.

26:30.021 --> 26:34.759
THE YEAR BEFORE HE DIED,
HE WENT FULL-ON HEMINGWAY.

26:34.794 --> 26:36.628
-THOMAS CARVER?
-YES!

26:36.662 --> 26:38.364
I DIDN'T SEE MUCH OF HIM,
THANK GOD, BUT WHEN I DID,

26:38.596 --> 26:41.634
HE WAS BLOWING MONEY,
DRINKING, PAINKILLERS.

26:41.666 --> 26:44.236
THE GUY HAD DEMONS
EVEN I FIND DARK.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.972
I'M SORRY.
JUST EXCUSE ME
FOR ONE SECOND.

26:47.006 --> 26:48.307
NO. YES, OF COURSE.
TAKE YOUR TIME.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.711
(breathing heavily)

27:01.619 --> 27:04.757
-(pop music playing)
-(laughing, chattering)

27:11.696 --> 27:13.965

27:15.800 --> 27:17.769

27:21.307 --> 27:24.876

27:26.011 --> 27:28.681
AND NOW I JUST--
I FEEL SO SICK.

27:28.713 --> 27:31.049
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WORSE--
THE CLINICAL TRIAL

27:31.083 --> 27:34.720
OR FINDING OUT
THAT MY DAD WAS A JERK.

27:36.288 --> 27:38.691
I'M SORRY.

27:39.892 --> 27:42.427
EVERYTHING I THOUGHT
I KNEW ABOUT HIM IS FAKE.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.296
I HATE HIM.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.097
I COULD CARE LESS
ABOUT HIS BOOK

27:46.132 --> 27:47.932
OR WHATEVER ELSE HE DID.

27:47.967 --> 27:50.802
I JUST-- I'M SORRY,
I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU.

28:01.446 --> 28:05.917

28:05.951 --> 28:07.886
READY TO GET
YOUR WEDDING RECEPTION ON?

28:07.920 --> 28:10.455
-I DON'T THINK
WE WERE INVITED.
-NO, OF COURSE NOT.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.691
BUT I FIGURED,
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED EARLIER,

28:12.724 --> 28:15.294
IT MIGHT BE NICE
TO GET BACK TO OUR ORIGINS,

28:15.326 --> 28:16.929
HAVE ONE
OF OUR ADVENTURES.

28:16.961 --> 28:18.297
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

28:19.397 --> 28:21.099
(chuckles)

28:27.705 --> 28:29.040
(Texas accent)
HOWDY, Y'ALL. WE'RE JUST

28:29.075 --> 28:31.242
A COUPLE OF OLD COLLEGE
FRIENDS FROM DALLAS.

28:31.277 --> 28:32.744
-(clicks tongue)
-(laughs)

28:32.778 --> 28:33.846
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THE BRIDE, Y'ALL?

28:40.419 --> 28:43.221
-(gasps) UMM...
-NOT BAD, HUH?

28:43.255 --> 28:44.990
SARA KNOWS HER STUFF.

28:49.994 --> 28:51.763
-WHA-OH!
-(cheering)

28:56.469 --> 28:59.137
(Canadian accent)
OH YEAH, NO, I'M A COUSIN
FROM CALGARY.

28:59.171 --> 29:01.207
DID YOU TELL HIM
THE STORY ABOUT THE MOOSE?

29:01.240 --> 29:03.375
OH YES, ALL--
ALL "ABOOT" IT.

29:03.409 --> 29:06.144
-MM-HMM.
-I'M NOT CANADIAN.

29:10.015 --> 29:12.117
TRY THE MELOPITA.

29:14.953 --> 29:17.288
-IS THAT GOOD?
-YEAH.

29:17.323 --> 29:18.757
-YEAH?
-IT'S SO GOOD.

29:20.291 --> 29:21.794
(man speaks Greek)

29:25.463 --> 29:28.267
-HERE, TAKE THIS.
-(cheering)

29:31.436 --> 29:32.438
CHEERS.

29:32.471 --> 29:34.874
(pop music playing)

29:34.906 --> 29:37.542
SO, THE FARRAH FAWCETT POSTER
IN YOUR ROOM,

29:37.776 --> 29:39.545
THAT WASN'T BECAUSE
YOU THOUGHT SHE WAS HOT?

29:39.778 --> 29:43.449
OH GOD!
NO, NO, I JUST LOVED
HER FEATHERED HAIR.

29:43.481 --> 29:46.451
-IT WAS SO CHIC.
-(laughs)

29:47.786 --> 29:50.788
YOU REALLY WERE,
PROBABLY, ONE OF THE BEST
BOYFRIENDS I EVER HAD.

29:50.823 --> 29:53.025
NO, YOU WERE
VERY RESPECTFUL.

29:53.057 --> 29:54.292
THAT'S BECAUSE--
NO OFFENSE--

29:54.326 --> 29:57.363
I WAS NEVER INTERESTED
IN ALL THAT, YOU KNOW, STUFF.

29:59.932 --> 30:02.500
-OKAY!
-I MEAN...

30:03.969 --> 30:06.271
WOW. IT'S SO GOOD
TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE.

30:07.306 --> 30:09.909
THE PAST FEW MONTHS
HAVE JUST BEEN...

30:09.942 --> 30:11.410
WELL, I--
I ALREADY TOLD YOU.

30:11.442 --> 30:13.077
-(chuckles)
-YOU KNOW WHAT, THOUGH?

30:13.112 --> 30:15.814
I CAN'T HELP BUT IMAGINE THAT
IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET HARDER.

30:15.847 --> 30:18.150
ONE DAUGHTER GETTING MARRIED
AND LEAVING HOME,

30:18.183 --> 30:20.352
AND THEN THE OTHER ONE
GRADUATING FROM
HIGH SCHOOL AND...

30:21.452 --> 30:26.258
EVEN MY 75-YEAR-OLD
MOTHER HAS A BOYFRIEND,
AND THAT BRIDGE CLUB.

30:26.291 --> 30:28.560
EMMA? WORSHIP HER.

30:28.594 --> 30:31.096
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WENT THROUGH A SIMILAR THING

30:31.130 --> 30:34.599
WHEN MY SON WENT TO COLLEGE.
IT WAS AS IF...

30:34.833 --> 30:36.568
I WAS ENTERING A WHOLE
NEW PHASE OF MY LIFE

30:36.602 --> 30:40.138
WHERE MY KID
WASN'T THE CENTER
OF MY EVERY BREATH.

30:40.172 --> 30:43.474
I WAS-- I FELT LOST.

30:43.509 --> 30:48.113
FORTUNATELY, MY NEIGHBOR,
ROBERT, INTRODUCED ME
TO THE RUNNING CLUB.

30:48.146 --> 30:51.616
NOW, I HAVE
A LIFE THAT'S NOT JUST
ABOUT BEING A DAD.

30:51.849 --> 30:54.586
IT'S WEIRD, BUT IT'S ALSO--
IT'S GRATIFYING.

30:55.587 --> 30:57.388
-TO GETTING THERE.
-(clinks)

31:00.226 --> 31:02.461
"WE ALWAYS KNEW
YOU TWO WOULD TIE THE KNOT,

31:02.493 --> 31:04.563
"EVEN IF IT TOOK NICK
SO LONG TO PROPOSE."

31:04.596 --> 31:07.432
OH, NICK AND YOUR
COMMITMENT ISSUES.

31:07.465 --> 31:10.568
AND NOW, I'D LIKE
TO CALL UP THE BRIDE

31:10.603 --> 31:12.238
TO DANCE WITH HER FATHER.

31:12.270 --> 31:14.906
(cheering)

31:23.882 --> 31:24.950
ARE YOU OKAY?

31:26.352 --> 31:31.490
I... HATE THAT I'M SAD
THAT MY DAD WON'T
BE AT MY WEDDING,

31:31.522 --> 31:35.027
THAT... HE WON'T WALK ME
DOWN THE AISLE, AND...

31:36.494 --> 31:39.365
I'LL NEVER HAVE
A FATHER-DAUGHTER DANCE.

31:43.434 --> 31:47.605
(sighs) MOSTLY I HATE
THAT EVEN AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT I FOUND OUT ABOUT HIM,

31:48.941 --> 31:50.476
I STILL LOVE HIM.

31:52.344 --> 31:55.580
Leo: WELL, THAT'S...
BECAUSE HE'LL ALWAYS
BE YOUR DAD.

31:57.182 --> 31:59.250
IT WAS BETTER NOT
TO KNOW EVERYTHING.

31:59.285 --> 32:02.587
-(crying)
-WELL, YOU SHOULD KNOW
AS MUCH AS YOU WANT.

32:04.022 --> 32:06.557
BUT WHEN IT COMES
TO THE TWO OF US,
IT'S DIFFERENT.

32:06.592 --> 32:09.662
WE SHOULD GET TO KNOW
EVERYTHING ABOUT EACH OTHER.

32:11.096 --> 32:13.231
I'VE DONE SOME
CRAPPY THINGS IN MY LIFE,

32:13.265 --> 32:15.467
LIKE SLEEPING WITH
MY BEST FRIEND'S GIRLFRIEND,

32:15.500 --> 32:18.604
WHICH I MIGHT'VE ONLY DONE
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
I WAS GONNA DIE,

32:18.636 --> 32:22.106
BUT I STILL DID IT.
THAT'S A PART OF WHO I AM.

32:23.575 --> 32:26.612
I WANT YOU
TO KNOW ALL THAT STUFF,
THE GOOD AND THE BAD.

32:27.945 --> 32:30.415
I WANT THAT, TOO. I DO.

32:30.449 --> 32:33.551
IT'S JUST SO HARD
TO BE OPEN ABOUT EVERYTHING

32:33.585 --> 32:36.121
WHEN I'M JUST FINDING OUT
ABOUT MY DAD'S LIES.

32:36.154 --> 32:37.690
I GET THAT.

32:39.424 --> 32:42.461
MAYBE I NEED TO COME TO TERMS
WITH WHO HE REALLY WAS,

32:42.493 --> 32:44.962
AND I'M--
I'M LETTING HIM
HOLD ME BACK

32:44.997 --> 32:48.166
FROM LIVING MY LIFE,
AND THAT'S NO WAY TO LIVE.

33:03.648 --> 33:06.184
-(pop music playing)
-OKAY, FIRST OFF, YOU'RE WRONG.

33:06.218 --> 33:09.288
I'M TELLING YOU, I'M NOT.
I STUDIED ABROAD IN MELBOURNE
FOR SIX MONTHS.

33:09.320 --> 33:10.556
REALLY?
'CAUSE I WAS BORN THERE.

33:10.588 --> 33:12.458
RACE YOU TO FIND OUT
THE ANSWER?

33:12.490 --> 33:15.426
OKAY, FINE.
(laughs)

33:16.761 --> 33:18.430
YES, GOT IT FIRST!

33:18.463 --> 33:20.098
BUT-- OH, DAMN IT,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

33:20.132 --> 33:23.268
THE OFFICIAL FLOWER
OF AUSTRALIA IS
THE GOLDEN WATTLE.

33:23.301 --> 33:25.069
-WHO KNEW?
-I DID.

33:25.104 --> 33:27.538
-YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A BAD AUSSIE.
-WELL, YOU'RE KIND OF A LOSER

33:27.573 --> 33:29.441
FOR HAVING KNOWN THAT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

33:29.474 --> 33:32.310
-THAT'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD KNOW.
-HEY. BETH, YOU HAVING FUN?

33:32.344 --> 33:34.278
BEST NIGHT
IN A WHILE, ACTUALLY.

33:34.313 --> 33:36.448
ANY CHANCE THAT MEANS YOU
MIGHT JOIN THE RUNNING CLUB?

33:36.481 --> 33:39.183
OH, WILLIAM,
WHILE I OFTEN WISH
IT WERE THE CASE,

33:39.218 --> 33:41.653
-I AM NOT A GAY MAN.
-YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE GAY
TO BE IN THE CLUB.

33:41.686 --> 33:43.221
-MY SON GABE'S NOT.
-HM-MMM.

33:43.255 --> 33:44.722
GABE'S YOUR SON?

33:46.191 --> 33:48.126
-YOU'RE NOT GAY.
-(both laugh)

33:48.160 --> 33:49.528
I KNOW. BUMMER.

33:49.560 --> 33:52.564
-I... I JUST ASSUMED...
-OKAY.

33:52.597 --> 33:54.532
THE ABBA SING-ALONG
IS STARTING SOON.

33:54.566 --> 33:55.666
-OKAY.
-COME ON.

33:55.701 --> 33:57.102
YOU'VE GOTTA DO THIS.
IT'S SO MUCH FUN.

33:57.135 --> 33:58.703

YEAH, YOU'VE ALSO ABANDONED
YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES.

34:19.657 --> 34:22.094
GERTRUDE IS DEPRESSED

34:22.126 --> 34:24.663

34:24.695 --> 34:26.664
-"SHE'S JUST A DOG"?
-YEAH.

34:26.697 --> 34:28.766

A BRAIN TRANSPLANT.

34:30.568 --> 34:32.503
CAN I GET SOME TEA
IN THIS HOUSE, PLEASE?

34:32.538 --> 34:34.840

-YEAH.
-NO WONDER YOU ALWAYS

AT THAT PRIVATE SCHOOL.

34:54.626 --> 34:57.663
-WAIT. YOU GO HOME TO HER?
-WELL, OF COURSE.

34:57.695 --> 34:59.864
WE STILL LIVE TOGETHER.

35:00.097 --> 35:04.536
-SO, YOU'RE NOT FUMIGATING.
-NO, BUT I'M LOOKING FOR
A NEW APARTMENT, I SWEAR.

35:04.570 --> 35:06.704
IT'S JUST THAT
GERTRUDE IS STILL MY DOG.

35:06.737 --> 35:09.173
DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT
IT'S BETTER TO BE WITH
SOMEONE YOUR OWN AGE?

35:09.208 --> 35:12.443
-WHAT'S UP WITH YOU
DATING A 40-YEAR-OLD?
-OKAY. YOU CAN'T HELP

AND UNLIKE YOU,

35:15.146 --> 35:17.882
-I AM ACTUALLY LEGAL.
-(scoffs)

35:18.115 --> 35:21.487
LOOK, BRENNA...
JULIET IS STILL
MY BEST FRIEND,

35:21.519 --> 35:25.657
AND I STILL CARE ABOUT HER.
I WILL ALWAYS CARE ABOUT HER.

35:25.690 --> 35:27.693
THANK YOU, MARGO.

35:27.726 --> 35:30.496
THAT ACTUALLY
MEANS A LOT. I...

35:30.528 --> 35:32.364
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND, TOO.

35:38.302 --> 35:40.806
MARGO, IT'S OVER.

35:41.806 --> 35:45.744
YOU GUYS NEED TO GET OUT
OF MY HOUSE, RIGHT NOW.

35:50.349 --> 35:52.317
-GERTRUDE, LET'S GO. (claps)
-(Gertrude whines)

35:55.320 --> 35:56.420
YES, MAY I HELP YOU?

35:57.422 --> 36:00.391
I'M APRIL CARVER,
THOMAS'S DAUGHTER.

36:01.760 --> 36:04.563
OH GOD. (sighs)

36:04.596 --> 36:06.632
I'M SORRY. IF I'D KNOWN,

36:06.664 --> 36:09.668
I WOULD NEVER HAVE
ATTEMPTED TO... SEDUCE--

36:09.701 --> 36:13.672
I READ THE FIRST 200 PAGES
OF THE BOOK THAT MY DAD WAS
WRITING BEFORE HE DIED.

36:13.704 --> 36:15.541
DO YOU KNOW
IF HE EVER FINISHED IT?

36:15.574 --> 36:19.277
(sighs)
WELL, YES, HE DID,
BUT I NEVER SAW IT.

36:19.311 --> 36:22.481
YOUR FATHER ONLY
SENT ME THE FIRST PART
WHEN WE WERE STILL TALKING.

36:22.514 --> 36:25.650
EARLIER, YOU SAID
THAT HE ONLY WENT CRAZY

36:25.684 --> 36:27.552
A YEAR BEFORE HE DIED.

36:27.585 --> 36:29.922
DO YOU KNOW
IF ANYTHING HAPPENED?

36:29.954 --> 36:33.759
NO, I DON'T.
DON'T YOU RECALL SEEING
A... CHANGE IN HIM?

36:34.826 --> 36:37.829
-NO, I WAS AWAY
AT COLLEGE.
-AH.

36:39.231 --> 36:42.668
WELL, YES, IT... (laughs)
IT REALLY WAS AS IF
A SWITCH WAS FLIPPED.

36:42.701 --> 36:45.269
HE TRANSFORMED
INTO A DIFFERENT PERSON.
PERHAPS...

36:46.405 --> 36:48.440
YOU'RE LUCKY YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO SEE THAT SIDE OF HIM.

36:49.440 --> 36:52.878
I'VE READ ALL
OF MY DAD'S BOOKS
HUNDREDS OF TIMES,

36:52.911 --> 36:54.545
BUT THIS ONE...

36:54.579 --> 36:56.347
IT'S DIFFERENT.

36:56.380 --> 36:59.451
WELL, HE WAS WRITING
HIS MANUSCRIPT DURING
THAT PERIOD OF TIME.

37:00.686 --> 37:05.222
ALL I WANT IS TO KNOW MORE.
I HAVE SO MANY THINGS
I WISH I COULD ASK HIM.

37:05.257 --> 37:06.891
THOMAS CARVER WAS
MANY THINGS,

37:06.925 --> 37:09.393
SOME, YES,
NOT SO FLATTERING.

37:09.427 --> 37:11.463
YET ONE THING HE ALWAYS WAS,

37:11.496 --> 37:12.864
WAS A GREAT WRITER.

37:12.898 --> 37:16.400
I TOOK A LOOK
AT YOUR STORY
AFTER YOU LEFT

37:16.434 --> 37:18.269
AND, COME TO THINK OF IT,

37:18.302 --> 37:22.541
READING YOUR WRITING
REMINDED ME OF EDITING...

37:22.574 --> 37:23.809
HIS WORK.

37:24.809 --> 37:26.545
YES, YOU HAVE
YOUR FATHER'S TALENT.

37:26.577 --> 37:29.715
IT MUST RUN
IN THE GENE POOL,
BECAUSE THERE'S...

37:29.748 --> 37:31.949
WELL, THERE'S
REAL PROMISE HERE.

37:48.532 --> 37:49.867
REMEMBER,
GO AT YOUR OWN PACE.

37:49.900 --> 37:51.769
AND IF YOU GET TIRED,
JUST TAKE A BREAK.

37:51.802 --> 37:53.871
OH, AND WATCH OUT
FOR BIKE RIDERS.

37:53.905 --> 37:55.673
THEY ARE NOT
OUR FRIENDS.

37:55.706 --> 37:57.809
WE'RE GONNA MEET
AT THE ARLINGTON ENTRANCE
TO THE PUBLIC GARDEN.

37:57.842 --> 37:59.777
-OKAY. WILLIAM.
-WHAT?

37:59.811 --> 38:03.815
-THANKS. TRULY.
-OH! WE'RE GONNA HAVE
SO MUCH FUN!

38:03.849 --> 38:05.016
(giggles)

38:05.050 --> 38:07.018
-GOD, EVERYONE'S
IN SUCH A RUSH.
-YEAH, I KNOW.

38:07.052 --> 38:08.987
-IT'S TOO EARLY.
-HEY, ARE YOU GUYS COMING?

38:12.623 --> 38:14.626
WELL, I HAVE A CONFESSION,
AND IT'S SHOCKING,

38:14.659 --> 38:16.827
BUT I ABSOLUTELY
HATE RUNNING.

38:16.862 --> 38:20.766
IT SUCKS.
RUNNING CULTURE
MAKES ME SO MAD.

38:20.798 --> 38:23.601
I ONLY SHOWED UP
THIS MORNING BECAUSE
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE HERE.

38:23.635 --> 38:26.938
-I DID THE SAME THING.
-I'M JUST A SOCIAL MEMBER
OF THE CLUB.

38:26.972 --> 38:28.907
CAN'T HELP BUT LOVE
THOSE ABBA SING-ALONGS.

38:28.940 --> 38:31.409
-RIGHT?
-OH MY GOD,
THEY'RE THE BEST!

38:31.443 --> 38:33.679
-WE DON'T NEED THEM.
-YOU'RE RIGHT, WE DON'T.

38:33.711 --> 38:35.681
-ENJOY.
-YEAH, YOU GUYS HAVE FUN.

38:35.713 --> 38:37.516
-GOD, THEY'RE GONNA
HAVE THE WORST TIME.
-(door closes)

38:37.548 --> 38:40.452
-YEAH, WHY WOULD YOU WANNA RUN?
-I CANNOT THINK
OF ANYTHING WORSE!

38:40.485 --> 38:42.653
-IT'S TOO EARLY
TO BE RUNNING.
-(laughs)

38:43.655 --> 38:44.588
OKAY...

38:45.657 --> 38:48.025
-ARE YOU READY?
-ARE YOU?

38:48.059 --> 38:51.730
YEAH, LET'S DO IT.
(clears throat)

38:51.762 --> 38:55.367
"IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU'VE DREAMED OF DOING
FOR A LONG TIME?

38:55.400 --> 38:57.068
"WHY HAVEN'T YOU DONE IT?"

38:57.101 --> 39:01.572
-MMM. HONESTLY...
-THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO BE.

39:02.606 --> 39:05.844
FOR A LONG TIME
I DREAMED OF BEING
A NOVELIST LIKE MY DAD.

39:05.876 --> 39:10.114
AND THE REASON
I DIDN'T DO IT WAS
BECAUSE HE DISCOURAGED ME.

39:11.483 --> 39:13.617
YOU KNOW WHAT?
SCREW MY DAD.

39:13.652 --> 39:15.387
I DON'T NEED
HIS VALIDATION ANYMORE.

39:16.588 --> 39:17.688
I'M GONNA WRITE A BOOK.

39:17.722 --> 39:20.659
(both chuckle)

39:42.880 --> 39:45.684
-HI.
-HEY.

39:49.755 --> 39:52.791
I DROPPED THE DRESS OFF
AT GOODWILL THIS MORNING.

39:52.824 --> 39:54.793
AND THEY TOOK IT?

39:54.826 --> 39:58.463
WELL, I SUPPOSE
IT'LL WIN SOMEONE THE...

39:58.496 --> 40:02.701
TACKIEST HALLOWEEN
COSTUME CONTEST PRIZE.

40:02.733 --> 40:07.172
(gasps)
OH! YOU LOOK GORGEOUS!

40:07.405 --> 40:09.541
-THIS IS DEFINITELY THE ONE.
-YOU SEE?

40:09.574 --> 40:12.844
IT'S A GOOD THING I KEPT
MY BEAUTIFUL WEDDING DRESS.

40:14.012 --> 40:17.581
F.Y.I., IT'S NOT HARD
TO GET OFF.

40:17.615 --> 40:19.451
-OH!
-(both laugh)

40:19.483 --> 40:21.887
I THINK I STILL HAVE
THE VEIL SOMEWHERE.

40:21.920 --> 40:25.657
-LET ME GO FIND IT.
-(laughing)

40:27.125 --> 40:29.661
IT DOESN'T EVEN NEED
THAT MUCH TAILORING.

40:29.693 --> 40:32.063
I MEAN, IT'S PERFECT.

40:33.632 --> 40:35.699
SO, HOW'D
THE QUESTIONNAIRE GO?

40:35.733 --> 40:37.735
OH. WELL, IT WASN'T EASY,

40:37.768 --> 40:40.838
BUT, LUCKILY,
LEO AND I FINALLY
OPENED UP TO EACH OTHER.

40:40.871 --> 40:42.807
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

40:42.840 --> 40:46.978
YEAH, I WISH YOUR FATHER AND I
HAD DONE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
BEFORE WE GOT MARRIED.

40:47.012 --> 40:49.447
THINGS MIGHT'VE GONE
A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY.

40:49.481 --> 40:52.818
MOM, I KNOW WE ALL GOT PAST
DAD'S ONE BIG LIE,

40:52.851 --> 40:57.588
BUT DO YOU THINK THAT
THERE'S ANY CHANCE HE WAS
HIDING OTHER THINGS?

40:58.590 --> 41:02.092
HONEY, I WONDER
ABOUT THAT ALL THE TIME.
I HAVE NO IDEA.

41:02.126 --> 41:05.630
THE ONLY PERSON WHO REALLY
KNEW YOUR DAD WAS GEORGE.

41:06.898 --> 41:10.501
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE THE REAL REASON I HELD
ONTO MY DRESS ALL THOSE YEARS

41:10.534 --> 41:12.670
WASN'T BECAUSE
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT
IT WAS STUNNING.

41:12.704 --> 41:14.139
I THINK...

41:14.172 --> 41:18.809
IT MIGHT'VE JUST
BEEN THAT I REALLY LIKED
THE MEMORY OF THE DAY

41:18.844 --> 41:20.579
AND WHAT IT SYMBOLIZED,

41:20.612 --> 41:23.047
MORE SO
THAN THE ACTUAL PARTS
OF THE MARRIAGE.

41:24.215 --> 41:27.719
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY THAT
YOU TEND TO HAVE THE SAME KIND
OF MARRIAGE AS YOUR PARENTS,

41:27.751 --> 41:29.621
WHICH, APRIL, I...

41:29.653 --> 41:31.590
I HOPE IS NOT
THE CASE WITH YOU.

41:31.623 --> 41:34.259
I MEAN, IF THERE'S
ANYTHING I WANT YOU
TO HAVE LEARNED FROM US,

41:34.492 --> 41:36.760
IT'S THAT YOU SHOULD
DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY
THAN WE DID.

41:37.762 --> 41:40.599
MOST IMPORTANTLY,
JUST BE HONEST
WITH ONE ANOTHER.

41:40.632 --> 41:42.967
IT'S NOT GONNA BE HARD.
LEO'S A GOOD GUY.

41:43.001 --> 41:44.902
-THAT HE IS.
-(chuckles)

41:44.936 --> 41:47.905
IN FACT, HE'S SO GREAT,
HE'S BEEN PRACTICING THOSE
DANCE MOVES YOU TAUGHT HIM.

41:47.938 --> 41:49.673
-REALLY?
-(both laugh)

41:49.708 --> 41:52.277
-THINK MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME
FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT...
-YES.

41:52.510 --> 41:54.713
...IN THIS DRESS,
SO I'M NOT COMPLETELY
OUTSHINED AT MY WEDDING?

41:54.746 --> 41:56.715
-OKAY.
-ALL RIGHT.

41:56.748 --> 41:59.784
-ALL RIGHT, IS THERE
A WAY TO HOLD IT?
-YEAH, THAT'S IT.

42:01.119 --> 42:04.121
-(laughs) COOL.
-OKAY.

42:04.155 --> 42:06.590
-ANOTHER WAY?
-OH! OOH!

42:11.061 --> 42:13.731
(end theme music playing)
