02:20.333 --> 02:21.967
SUCH A RICH DARK BARK ON THERE.

02:21.967 --> 02:23.700
THAT'S WHERE ALL THE FLAVOR IS

02:23.700 --> 02:25.633
JUST FALLING OFF THE BONE.

02:25.633 --> 02:27.333
SHOVE AN APPLE IN HIS MOUTH AND

02:27.333 --> 02:29.933
GET HIM ON THE TABLE.

02:29.933 --> 02:30.633
MOVING ON.

02:30.633 --> 02:32.933
IF THIS CRUISE SHIP'S AROCKING

02:32.933 --> 02:35.733
DON'T WORRY THE POOL TABLE HAS A

02:35.733 --> 02:40.533
BUILT IN GYROSCOPE.

02:40.533 --> 02:43.600
WATCH OUT FOR POOL SHARKS.

02:43.600 --> 02:46.167
DO YOU GET IT?

02:46.167 --> 02:49.567
I WOULDN'T MIND A SELF-LEVELING

02:49.567 --> 02:52.833
STOMACH TO STOP THE WAVES OF

02:52.833 --> 02:56.133
DIARRHEA FROM CRUISE FOOD.

03:02.900 --> 03:05.333
BARGE THAT I WAS ON.

03:05.333 --> 03:07.533
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

STRIKE AWAY FROM FINALLY

03:24.700 --> 03:25.600

03:35.433 --> 03:39.067
>> OH MY GOD.

03:39.067 --> 03:41.167

03:41.167 --> 03:44.667
OUT OF THAT RELATIONSHIP.

03:44.667 --> 03:46.433
>> LUWILL YOU MARRY ME?

03:46.433 --> 03:47.633
>> YES I WILL.

03:47.633 --> 03:51.267
>> EVERY GIRL'S FANTASY, A

03:51.267 --> 03:51.700

03:59.633 --> 04:01.667
HE WENT TO KROGER.

04:01.667 --> 04:03.067
WHILE YOU'RE AT THE HOSPITAL YOU

04:03.067 --> 04:07.633
MIGHT WANT TO CHECK THE OLD

04:10.433 --> 04:11.567
TWO YEARS TOPS.

04:11.567 --> 04:12.067
ON HIS LIFE.

04:12.067 --> 04:13.067
NOT THE MARRIAGE.

04:13.067 --> 04:14.400
THE GUY DOESN'T LOOK HEALTHY TO

04:14.400 --> 04:14.700
ME.

04:14.700 --> 04:17.133

06:58.200 --> 06:58.600
BITCOINS.

06:58.600 --> 07:01.667
SO I WAS 18-YEAR-OLDS WHEN I

MADE MY FIRST MILLION DOLLARS.

07:04.067 --> 07:07.067
IT WAS PRETTY GREAT.

ARE YOU RENTING OR DID YOU BUY

09:47.733 --> 09:48.567
AN APARTMENT?

09:48.567 --> 09:49.400
>> JUST RENTING.

09:49.400 --> 09:51.933

09:56.767 --> 09:58.633
IT LOOKS LIKE A JAPANESE HOTEL

09:58.633 --> 09:59.367
OR SOMETHING.

09:59.367 --> 10:00.400
>> THERE'S THREE BEDS.

>> WHEN DID YOU GET IN ON

10:12.500 --> 10:12.867

10:15.633 --> 10:15.967
2011.

10:15.967 --> 10:17.367
>> HOW MANY COINS DID YOU BUY

10:17.367 --> 10:17.967

10:17.967 --> 10:20.167
>> OVER 100 COINS.

10:20.167 --> 10:21.500
AND I HAVE EVEN MORE NOW.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.567

10:23.900 --> 10:24.500
>> WAY MORE.

10:24.500 --> 10:25.333

10:30.833 --> 10:32.633
>> IT'S LIKE ABOUT $1,200.

10:32.633 --> 10:33.167
>> OKAY.

10:33.167 --> 10:34.500
WELL I CAN'T DO THAT KIND OF

10:34.500 --> 10:34.833

10:34.833 --> 10:37.100
HOW DID YOU HAVE $1,200 AS A

10:37.100 --> 10:37.567
12-YEAR-OLD.

10:37.567 --> 10:39.267

10:39.267 --> 10:41.300
A LITTLE OVER $1,000 FOR MY

10:41.300 --> 10:42.267
SCHOLARSHIP FUND AND I DIDN'T

10:42.267 --> 10:43.767

10:52.733 --> 10:53.800
YOU THAT HAS IT ALL.

10:53.800 --> 10:55.700
>> IF I HAD A THUMB DRIVE ON ME

I'D GET SHOT AND MURDERED SO

10:57.433 --> 10:57.767
FAST.

10:57.767 --> 10:59.433
>> HAVE THERE EVER BEEN THREATS

10:59.433 --> 11:00.533

11:16.633 --> 11:19.200
I WANT ALL OF THIS ON CAMERA.

11:19.200 --> 11:23.133
MY MOM WAS HEAVILY INVESTED IN

11:39.333 --> 11:41.600
>> IT'S LIKE ANY OTHER CURRENCY.

11:41.600 --> 11:44.300
IT CAN RUN SELF-EFFICIENTLY.

11:44.300 --> 11:46.067
>> HOW OFTEN DO THEY INTRODUCE

11:46.067 --> 11:47.533
MORE COINS INTO CIRCULATION?

11:47.533 --> 11:50.167
>> THERE'S THINGS CALLED BITCOIN

11:50.167 --> 11:50.533
MINORS.

11:50.533 --> 11:52.267
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE SERVERS

11:52.267 --> 11:54.100
AND PAID YOU TO RUN PART OF

11:54.100 --> 11:55.333
FACEBOOK ON YOUR LAPTOP.

11:55.333 --> 11:56.767
SO PEOPLE GET PAID FOR

11:56.767 --> 11:57.967
DEDICATING THEIR COMPUTER SPACE

11:57.967 --> 12:00.467
TO RUNNING THE BITCOIN NETWORK.

12:06.967 --> 12:08.467
PEOPLE HAVE TO BE CHEATING THIS.

12:08.467 --> 12:09.767
NOBODY IS REGULATING?

12:09.767 --> 12:12.100

STAY FOREVER.

12:29.967 --> 12:30.833
WHEN IS THE DOLLAR GOING TO

12:30.833 --> 12:31.933
COLLAPSE AND YOU'RE GOING TO

12:31.933 --> 12:32.900
LOSE ALL YOUR MONEY.

12:32.900 --> 12:33.467
>> SOON.

12:33.467 --> 12:35.200
I'M NOT INVESTED OVERSEAS.

12:35.200 --> 12:36.933
DON'T GET AHEAD OF YOURSELF,

12:36.933 --> 12:37.233
KID.

12:37.233 --> 12:39.267
IF BITCOIN WENT TO ZERO RIGHT

12:39.267 --> 12:40.867
NOW, WOULD YOU STILL BE A

12:40.867 --> 12:41.300
MILLIONAIRE?

12:45.667 --> 12:46.900
>> IT WOULD BE A HIT.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.800
>> YEAH, IF ALL OF YOUR REAL

12:48.800 --> 12:52.633
ESTATE PROPERTIES WERE BURNT

12:52.633 --> 12:54.400
DOWN THAT WOULD ALSO SUCK.

12:55.767 --> 12:57.300
BACK UP TO 20,000?

12:57.300 --> 12:58.967
>> PAST 20,000 FOR SURE.

12:58.967 --> 13:00.400
>> WHAT ABOUT SNAKE EYES?

13:00.400 --> 13:01.833
DO YOU THINK SNAKE EYES WILL

13:01.833 --> 13:02.900
EVER GET OVER 20,000.

13:15.900 --> 13:17.633
THE WHOLE THING AND I COMPLETELY

13:17.633 --> 13:18.233
IGNORED IT.
