<i>Though perhaps "cave"</i>

<i>piles of unwashed clothes,</i>

04:43.573 --> 04:45.905
<i>the scent of stale beer</i>

04:45.975 --> 04:48.808
<i>It looked like</i>

<i>I had ever seen in college,</i>

04:48.878 --> 04:52.109
<i>which is precisely</i>
<i>why I neverjoined one.</i>

04:52.982 --> 04:56.850
<i>And according to this notebook,</i>
<i>my real name was Knut Wileton.</i>

04:56.919 --> 05:00.320
<i>That was Knut with a "K,"</i>
<i>so I was named after the king</i>

It seems this Knut Wileton
is into the ten-year plan.

06:53.402 --> 06:57.133
Let me guess: He's a P.E. major
with a minor in underwater
hotel management.

06:57.206 --> 07:01.768
Wrong. You're a physicist
with a shot at the Nobel prize.

07:01.844 --> 07:04.574
Just kidding.
Uh...

07:04.647 --> 07:08.879
Oh. Well, he's an art major.
Some kind of a sculptor.

07:08.951 --> 07:11.249
Probably works in beer cans.

07:11.320 --> 07:14.881
Okay, so, I gotta pass some test
or something, right?

07:14.957 --> 07:17.482
So he can stay in school
and become a great artist.
Is that it?

07:17.560 --> 07:20.495
No.

07:21.631 --> 07:26.125

are gonna plant a bomb

07:48.090 --> 07:53.027
<i>A bomb?</i>
<i>Yeah. Well, there was a lot ofbombs</i>
<i>planted on campuses in the '60s.</i>

<i>Usually protesting departments</i>
<i>whose, uh, research</i>...

07:56.165 --> 07:59.066
<i>Was related to the government's</i>
<i>war efforts in Vietnam.</i>

07:59.135 --> 08:00.397
Yeah.
Yeah?

08:00.469 --> 08:03.632
It goes off at 9:00 p.m.

08:03.706 --> 08:07.073
There wasn't supposed to be
anybody in there.
But this time there was?

08:07.143 --> 08:11.409
Right. A kid who snuck in late
to finish some project.

08:11.480 --> 08:13.471
And it killed him.

08:13.549 --> 08:16.814
Elizabeth went underground
and spent the rest of her life
on the run.

<i>[Sam]</i>

<i>that's happening in Vietnam?</i>

08:40.342 --> 08:43.539
I just...
I just came to apologize.

08:43.611 --> 08:46.376
Is that supposed to make
everything better?
No.

08:46.449 --> 08:48.883
It's supposed to start to make
things a little better.
Mmm.

08:48.951 --> 08:52.182
Well, the best way to do that
is by leaving.

08:52.254 --> 08:55.280
Maybe I could just
jump off a cliff instead.

08:55.358 --> 08:58.054
Well, that would mean
you were smart enough to find one.

08:58.127 --> 09:02.564
Look, Elizabeth,
I want to apologize, and...

09:02.631 --> 09:06.192
maybe we could get together sometime
and talk about what you're doing here.

09:06.268 --> 09:09.760
Do you really think that
I would ever go out with you?

09:09.839 --> 09:14.139
- I'm not talkin' about goin' out with me.
- Sam, you could be passin' up a good thing.

09:14.210 --> 09:16.644
Will you forget about
her body for a moment?

09:20.883 --> 09:23.215
I wasn't talkin' about you.
I don't care.

09:23.285 --> 09:27.551
Elizabeth, I...
I need to talk to you
about what you're doing here.

09:27.623 --> 09:30.956
Well, if it is that important
to you, then talk to Duck.

09:31.026 --> 09:33.654
I'm sure he can explain it
much better than I can.

09:33.729 --> 09:35.594
Here.

09:39.368 --> 09:41.563
No fair moving your lips.

09:45.374 --> 09:48.935
Look, um, are you really serious
about trying to stop the war?

09:49.011 --> 09:51.104
What do you think?

09:51.180 --> 09:54.581
Okay. Okay. Um...

09:54.650 --> 09:56.845
Then I'd like to help.
Good idea, Sam.

09:56.919 --> 09:59.183
[Scoffs]
Why?

09:59.255 --> 10:01.450
Because I agree with you
and Elizabeth. I think
the sooner we end it, the better.

10:01.524 --> 10:05.255
Oh. I see.
You wanna help here
so you can get to her.

10:06.395 --> 10:08.420
No, no. That's...
That's not what I mean.

10:08.497 --> 10:11.330
I... I'm really interested
in trying to end the war.

10:11.400 --> 10:13.493
You know, man, you're like glass.
I see right through you.

10:13.569 --> 10:16.003
Look, I'm not tryin' to hide anything.
I just wanna help.

10:16.071 --> 10:18.665
You keep saying that,
but I don't believe you.

10:18.741 --> 10:20.641
I mean, you just wanna
get to Elizabeth.

10:20.709 --> 10:25.646
Look, if you don't let me help, I mean,
I'm never gonna be able to prove to you
that I'm tellin' the truth.

10:25.714 --> 10:27.978
<i>On a</i>... <i>On a trial basis.</i>
<i>Just-Just for one day.</i>

No way, man.

10:31.053 --> 10:33.886
Thanks, but no thanks.

10:33.956 --> 10:36.652
<i>So you're really not serious</i>
<i>about trying to stop the war.</i>

10:36.725 --> 10:39.193
This is just like some kind of a...
what, a game or somethin'?

10:41.931 --> 10:44.331
You know, serious doesn't begin
to describe how I feel.

10:44.400 --> 10:47.836
Well, if you are serious,
then I don't understand why
you keep turning me down.

10:47.903 --> 10:50.303
I would think you could use
all the help you could get.

10:50.372 --> 10:53.705
You know, I underestimated you.

10:53.776 --> 10:56.973
You're not just some
big, hulking beer can.

10:57.046 --> 10:59.674
You're a lot smarter
than that.

10:59.748 --> 11:02.740
And deceptively smart people
need to be watched.

11:02.818 --> 11:05.378
That's why I'm gonna
be watching you,

11:05.454 --> 11:07.581
making sure that you don't get
anywhere near Elizabeth.

11:13.262 --> 11:15.628
Oh, great. That's good.

11:15.698 --> 11:20.601
Now you not only have
to figure out how to get
on Elizabeth's good side,

11:20.669 --> 11:24.002
you gotta be on the lookout
for that nozzle.

11:29.979 --> 11:34.575
Generally speaking,
oxidation is a loss of electrons...

11:34.650 --> 11:38.108
from an ion, an atom,
or a group of atoms...

11:38.187 --> 11:40.121
[Snoring]

11:40.189 --> 11:45.092
<i>to oxygen or to some other element</i>
<i>that acts in a manner similar to oxygen.</i>

11:45.160 --> 11:47.685
This transfer of electrons
produces heat...

11:47.763 --> 11:50.129
and sometimes light.

11:50.199 --> 11:52.133
Any questions?

11:52.201 --> 11:54.431
[Air Squeaking]

11:56.171 --> 11:58.298
Gentlemen, do you mind?

11:58.374 --> 12:00.205
<i>Thank you.</i>

12:04.413 --> 12:09.248
How do you justify
this department's participation
in a homicidal and illegal war?

12:11.654 --> 12:15.954
I think that the policies
of this university are contributing
to the destruction...

12:16.025 --> 12:19.290
Now, there's a taco I'd really
like to sink my teeth into...

12:19.361 --> 12:21.761
if she wasn't such a dip.
[Giggling]

12:24.500 --> 12:28.459
She's not a dip. She's just...
She's stating her opinion.

12:28.537 --> 12:32.871
The only opinion
you want to hear is...

12:32.942 --> 12:37.106
- [High Voice]
"Yes! Yes! Oh, golly, Knut, yes!"
- Come on.

12:38.647 --> 12:41.639
Hey, 10 bucks say
you can't get her to the luau.

12:41.717 --> 12:44.277
Sam, if you take her
to the luau,

12:44.353 --> 12:48.119
she can't be planting a bomb
in the chemistry building.

12:48.190 --> 12:50.522
<i>[Elizabeth]</i>
<i>By omission or commission,</i>

12:50.593 --> 12:54.996
if you aid in the perpetuation
of an immoral war,
aren't you equally as guilty?

12:55.064 --> 12:57.464
That's a question
for the philosophy department.

12:57.533 --> 13:00.502
This is a chemistry class.

13:00.569 --> 13:04.005
You're on.
<i>[Elizabeth] If you're not part of</i>
<i>the solution, you're part of the problem.</i>

13:04.073 --> 13:06.803
[Clears Throat]
Uh, isn't this really a moot question?

13:08.777 --> 13:11.337
<i>I think the real</i>
<i>question is, uh,</i>

13:11.413 --> 13:13.381
what do
the South Vietnamese want?

13:13.449 --> 13:15.644
<i>[Al]</i>
<i>That's a good point, Sam.</i>

13:15.718 --> 13:17.549
Are we trying to help
a friend in need,

13:17.620 --> 13:22.614
or are we trying to impose our will
upon a weaker country?

13:22.691 --> 13:26.752
Now, a lot of people might feel
that it's immoral to abandon
the war right now.

13:26.829 --> 13:31.823
- It's immoral to continue it!
- And a lot of people feel that way.

13:31.900 --> 13:35.199
But I think that we should take
our cue from the South Vietnamese.

13:35.270 --> 13:40.537
<i>Because once they lose the will</i>
<i>to fight, then no matter</i>
<i>what we want, or do,</i>

13:40.609 --> 13:43.840
I don't think there's
any way we can win.

13:48.217 --> 13:51.311
Hear! Hear!
Yeah.
Cheers.

13:51.387 --> 13:55.380
[Chattering]

13:55.457 --> 13:57.482
Could I, uh...
Could I talk to you
for a moment?

13:57.559 --> 13:59.754
Uh, I have to go
to a meeting.

13:59.828 --> 14:03.320
You mind if I come along?
It's a free country.

14:03.399 --> 14:06.960
Uh, Scooter? Scooter.

14:07.036 --> 14:09.061
Yes, sir,
Your Royal Wildness?

14:09.138 --> 14:11.902
Uh, who told you
to wear your underwear
on the outside of your pants?

14:13.242 --> 14:16.075
Uh, y-you did.

14:16.145 --> 14:20.309
You said whenever I went
to class, I had to do it.

14:20.382 --> 14:25.513
Oh, well, yeah. Good.
So, now you've done it.
You don't have to do it again.

14:25.587 --> 14:28.784
Oh, thank you,
Your Royal Wildness!

14:30.359 --> 14:35.058
- Don't mention it.
- What are you gonna do
with all that hamburger meat?

14:35.130 --> 14:39.794
It's for Dean Stomper's dog.
His dog?

14:39.868 --> 14:42.701
It's supposed to distract him
while I get the basketball.

14:42.771 --> 14:44.898
What basketball?
Well, you know.

14:44.973 --> 14:47.464
The one in his trophy case...

14:47.543 --> 14:50.637
that Wilt Chamberlain signed
and that he shows
at all the alumni meetings.

14:50.713 --> 14:53.113
No, Scooter. You don't have
to steal that basketball.

14:54.216 --> 14:58.312
But Hags and Guna and Will
said if I don't do it,

14:58.387 --> 15:00.651
I won't be in the fraternity.

15:00.723 --> 15:03.248
Uh, well... Um, okay. Listen.

15:03.325 --> 15:05.850
After you steal it,
bring it to me.

15:05.928 --> 15:08.396
Yes, sir.
Scooter...

15:15.504 --> 15:19.372
[Chuckles]
That's pretty...
pretty funny, huh?

15:19.441 --> 15:23.935
It's pretty stupid.
This whole pledge stuff,
it's ridiculous.

15:24.012 --> 15:26.674
It-It's humiliating.
I don't know why you do it.

15:26.749 --> 15:30.845
Well, m-maybe it's-it's like a...
a leftover from primitive times.

15:30.919 --> 15:33.353
What do you mean?

15:33.422 --> 15:36.448
Well, it's like a rite
of passage, an initiation.

15:36.525 --> 15:40.120
You know, like in the olden days,
when a boy wanted
to be considered a man,

15:40.195 --> 15:43.858
he had to go out and kill
a saber-toothed tiger
or something like that.

15:43.932 --> 15:47.868
So then he would be accepted as
an equal amongst the other hunters.

15:47.936 --> 15:49.870
Is that what you mean?
Exactly.

15:49.938 --> 15:55.308
And so now he has to wear
underwear on the outside
of his pants and steal basketballs?

15:55.377 --> 15:57.937
Hmm.
Which, depending
on how you look at it,

15:58.013 --> 16:02.313
is either incredibly lame
or infinitely more civilized.

16:02.384 --> 16:04.682
Oh, you are unbelievable.

16:04.753 --> 16:06.721
No, I figure in another
500,000 years,

16:06.789 --> 16:10.088
we'll have the tigers
wearing underwear
and-and-and stealing basketballs,

16:10.159 --> 16:13.458
and we will have
evolved beyond it.

16:14.463 --> 16:16.397
Maybe.

16:17.800 --> 16:21.031
But will we have evolved
out of war?

16:25.974 --> 16:29.375
<i>How long can we allow</i>
<i>the oppressive agendas...</i>

16:29.444 --> 16:31.503
of a selfish minority...

16:31.580 --> 16:35.539
to control the destiny
of a people located
halfway around the world?

16:35.617 --> 16:37.710
<i>Where is thejustice in that?</i>

16:37.786 --> 16:41.347
<i>The only people who want this war</i>
<i>are those who stand</i>
<i>to make a profit from it.</i>

16:41.423 --> 16:44.551
And the only ideology
that they're concerned with
is the bottom line.

16:44.626 --> 16:47.493
<i>And that is why we must do</i>
<i>whatever it takes,</i>

16:47.563 --> 16:50.031
<i>even if it means that we must</i>
<i>take up arms ourselves.</i>

16:50.098 --> 16:52.032
[Thinking]
There was something
a little spooky about Duck.

16:52.100 --> 16:54.034
A touch of the fanatic, perhaps.

16:54.102 --> 16:57.663
Now maybe the average citizen felt
Thomas Jefferson was kind of spooky...

16:57.739 --> 17:01.402
when he talked to them
about disobeying the laws
of Great Britain, I don't know.

17:01.476 --> 17:06.880
Violence is now the only language
that the-the bloated ruling class
can still understand.

17:06.949 --> 17:09.179
[Thinking]
But then again,
maybe they didn't.

17:09.251 --> 17:13.050

17:15.424 --> 17:19.723
Al, what does Elizabeth see
in a guy like this?
I don't know.

17:19.795 --> 17:23.526
Well, part of it's him,
but mostly it's the cause.

17:23.598 --> 17:28.229
You look at these kids around here,
most of them come from
comfortable backgrounds.

17:28.303 --> 17:32.262
They can afford to go to college,
so they don't have to go to Vietnam.

17:32.341 --> 17:35.868
And sometimes that...
that breeds guilt.

17:35.944 --> 17:38.469
She's tryin' to make up for that?
[Whirring]

17:38.547 --> 17:40.481
Well, guilt is part of it.

17:40.549 --> 17:45.987
Uh, part of it's also
a normal rebellion against
what the parents stand for.

17:46.054 --> 17:48.488
Hers, by the way, are loaded.

17:48.557 --> 17:52.618
<i>And then part of it</i>
<i>is her sincere desire to do...</i>

17:52.694 --> 17:56.755
what she believes is right.
<i>... to serve as a research tool</i>
<i>for the military-industrial complex,</i>

17:56.832 --> 17:59.858

as those who drop the bombs...

17:59.935 --> 18:03.063

are developed right here!

18:11.513 --> 18:15.313

a pretty great speaker.

18:15.384 --> 18:17.318
That's because he's right.

18:17.386 --> 18:19.946
Well, except for
the taking up arms ourselves.

18:20.022 --> 18:21.922
I mean, that kinda sounds
like civil war.

18:21.990 --> 18:24.925
Did you just come along here
to bug me or what?

18:24.993 --> 18:26.984
No, no, no.

18:27.062 --> 18:32.295
Uh, would you come to the luau
with me tomorrow night?

18:35.237 --> 18:38.968
Wh-What? What's the matter?
You don't... You don't like parties?

18:39.975 --> 18:44.674
Not if you call getting drunk
and throwing up a party, no.
Come on.

18:44.746 --> 18:48.238

need to party every once in a while.

28:03.972 --> 28:06.805
Elizabeth, violence
is not gonna stop this war.
But we've gotta end it.

28:06.875 --> 28:11.403
Too many people are dying.
Then stop it by using something
more powerful than violence.

28:11.479 --> 28:15.745
<i>Well, I'm afraid God seems to be</i>
<i>sitting this one out.</i>

28:15.817 --> 28:18.513
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

28:18.586 --> 28:23.956
I know this is a cliché,
but the pen is mightier
than the sword.

28:24.025 --> 28:27.859
Time for rhetoric is over!
You haven't even begun yet.

28:27.929 --> 28:31.330
Do you think 20 people
at an outdoor rally is a big deal?

28:31.399 --> 28:34.459
You need 20,000, 20 million!
That's impossible.

28:34.536 --> 28:36.970
Not with a pen.
Not with publicity.

28:37.038 --> 28:39.529
In any form... newspapers,
magazines, pamphlets, television.

28:39.607 --> 28:43.600
Television?
Television is gonna play a big part
in stopping this war.

28:43.678 --> 28:45.873
Publicity is the key,
not violence.

28:45.947 --> 28:49.940
The only reason why you're saying
this to me is because you want me
to go to some party with you.

28:50.018 --> 28:53.545
You don't care about the people
over there. You don't care about
how many soldiers are dying.

28:53.621 --> 28:55.748
- I do care.
- Hey, hey. Let her go.

28:55.823 --> 28:59.224
Just stay out of this.
Back off!
Don't! Don't!

28:59.294 --> 29:01.285
Stop it!

29:06.868 --> 29:12.329
Look, I lost a brother
in Vietnam, all right?
So don't tell me I don't care.

29:12.407 --> 29:15.638
Well, maybe you should've cared
just a little more about him
before he went.

29:19.047 --> 29:21.038
Knut!

29:22.517 --> 29:24.508
I'm sorry.

29:27.021 --> 29:29.319
I'm really sorry.

29:31.159 --> 29:33.821
Yeah.
Um...

29:33.895 --> 29:36.728
So what are you supposed
to wear to these luau things?

29:38.900 --> 29:41.368
<i>(music) [Rock]</i>

29:44.005 --> 29:45.973
<i>[Knut]</i>
<i>Great, uh</i>...
<i>Great party, huh?</i>

29:46.040 --> 29:48.167
Uh, yeah, yeah.

29:48.242 --> 29:50.767
It reminds me of my parents'
cocktail parties.

29:50.845 --> 29:54.337
Huh?
Oh, a lot of people talking,
but no one really listening.

29:54.415 --> 29:57.976
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Find the limbo pole!</i>
<i>[Glass Shattering]</i>

29:58.052 --> 29:59.917
Your mom and dad
don't listen to you?

29:59.988 --> 30:01.922
I think you're on
to something there, Sam.

30:01.990 --> 30:04.754
Well, you know parents.
Uh, always busy.

30:04.826 --> 30:09.092
Daddy making a lot of money,
Mom busy spending it.

30:09.163 --> 30:12.189
And you get lost in between.

30:12.266 --> 30:14.200
I mean... I mean,
you know what I mean.,

30:14.268 --> 30:17.601
It's like sometimes I feel like I'm
shouting at the top of my lungs,
and nobody seems to hear me.

30:17.672 --> 30:20.664
You know,
"Hello! Is anybody home?"

30:20.742 --> 30:22.733
Exactly. Exactly.

30:25.780 --> 30:27.975
By the way, you look terrific.
That's a great... shirt.

30:28.049 --> 30:29.983
You want a drink?
Please.

30:30.051 --> 30:31.985
That would be great.

30:32.053 --> 30:35.819
Uh, Knut, you know,
I was really thinking about
what you said this afternoon,

30:35.890 --> 30:38.586
and, uh, you were right.

30:38.660 --> 30:42.096
Oh, well...
Hey, hey, hey, Wild Thing.

30:42.163 --> 30:45.621
I'm gonna get myself
a mai tai.
I just...

30:45.700 --> 30:47.634
Let... Let's go in
the other room, okay?

30:47.702 --> 30:50.694
It'll be a little
less crowded, I hope.
Oh, okay.

30:50.772 --> 30:54.606
- <i>[Man]</i>
<i>Hey, hey, where you goin'?</i>
- Excuse us.

30:54.676 --> 30:56.667
Excuse us.

30:58.379 --> 31:00.677
Look, I just...

31:00.748 --> 31:05.447
I... I wanna apologize about
comin' down on you so hard
about all this stuff, and...

31:05.520 --> 31:08.284
Well, you were right.
Publicity is the key.

31:08.356 --> 31:11.291
I mean, look at...
Look what you did
to the toilets at our dorm.

31:11.359 --> 31:14.692
It spread across the campus
in a matter of seconds.

31:14.762 --> 31:18.892
- Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
- That was just a stupid prank though.
We never should have done that.

31:18.966 --> 31:20.991
Well, because it made no point.

31:21.069 --> 31:25.631
But had it been a symbolic gesture
trying to draw attention
to a serious problem,

31:25.707 --> 31:28.198
then that would have been
the best way to go about it.
What are you saying?

31:28.276 --> 31:32.110
Tonight we're gonna do
to the chemistry department
what they have been doing...

31:32.180 --> 31:34.148
all over South Vietnam.

31:34.215 --> 31:36.149
We're gonna bomb it.

31:36.217 --> 31:37.809
That is crazy!
No!

31:37.885 --> 31:41.116
No, it'll draw attention
to the carnage
they're causing in Vietnam.

31:41.189 --> 31:46.058
And-And maybe we can end this war
just that much sooner
so nobody else's brother has to die.

31:47.695 --> 31:51.995
And we would've never thought of it
if you hadn't blown up those toilets.

31:54.936 --> 31:57.496
Elizabeth, I can't let you do this.
It's too late.

31:57.572 --> 32:00.063
What do you mean, too late?

32:00.141 --> 32:03.577
Maybe she put a timing device
on the bomb, and that's
how come she could still be here.

32:03.644 --> 32:06.772
I gotta call Security.
What? No, you can't do that!
I'll get in trouble!

32:06.848 --> 32:10.181
Don't you understand?
Someone's gonna die because of this!
No. Nobody's gonna die.

32:10.251 --> 32:13.414
Nobody's there.
The building's empty.
Not tonight!

32:13.488 --> 32:16.082
<i>[Man, Drunkenly]</i>
<i>Hey, Wild Thing!</i>

32:16.157 --> 32:18.250
I need a phone!

32:18.326 --> 32:20.624
What's wrong
with the one right there?

32:23.297 --> 32:25.322
Operator. Operator.
Operator!

32:25.399 --> 32:29.768
Yeah, listen. I need
Campus Security immediately.
This is an emergency.

32:29.837 --> 32:32.135
Come on. Uh, yeah.
Hello. Security?

32:32.206 --> 32:35.733
I'd like to report a bomb
in the chemistry building.

32:35.810 --> 32:39.678
My name is Sam...
Uh, Wileton.
My name is Wileton.

32:40.715 --> 32:43.684
Yeah, right. Knut Wileton.

32:43.751 --> 32:46.914
No, this is not a prank!
This is real...

32:46.988 --> 32:50.253
Hello? Damn it.
Sam, try it again!

32:50.324 --> 32:52.724
They won't believe me.
That's the fourth call they've had
about a bomb this week.

32:52.794 --> 32:54.853
- Hey, Thing. You seen Scooter?
- No, I haven't.

32:54.929 --> 32:57.124
See, I told you
he'd never make it.
Well, maybe he got lucky.

32:57.198 --> 33:00.361
- Get outta here.
- Make what?

33:00.434 --> 33:03.562
We told him he had to sneak
into the chemistry lab and steal
a copy of Monday's exam.

33:03.638 --> 33:05.572
<i>[Hags]</i>
<i>Normally, you're</i>
<i>the best man for thejob.</i>

33:05.640 --> 33:07.801
<i>[Will] But since</i>
<i>you wouldn't let us cheat off you,</i>
<i>we knew you'd never go for it.</i>

33:07.875 --> 33:11.538
- He should've been back by now.
- Sam, it's quarter to 9:00.

33:11.612 --> 33:14.740
Don't you see?
This is no longer a publicity stunt.

33:14.816 --> 33:16.784
Scooter's gonna die.
Oh, my God.

33:16.851 --> 33:20.753
Please tell me... Just tell me where it is.
Uh, it's in a locker on the top floor
of the chemistry building.

33:20.822 --> 33:24.280
Wait! Knut!
<i>Man, how does he do it?</i>

33:24.358 --> 33:26.292
Maybe he uses deodorant.

33:26.360 --> 33:28.658
What are you doin' here?
You're supposed
to be gettin' blown up!

33:28.729 --> 33:32.256
Hey, hey.
Did you get the exam?
I... didn't get it.

33:32.333 --> 33:34.426
Sam! Come back!

33:34.502 --> 33:37.369
<i>Scooter's here!</i>

33:37.438 --> 33:40.236
Sam, if you don't come back,

33:40.308 --> 33:42.833
Ziggy says it's you and Elizabeth
who are gonna get killed!

33:42.910 --> 33:45.777
Sam!

33:45.847 --> 33:48.111
Hey, where's Wild Thing goin'?

33:50.418 --> 33:53.854
He's protecting the honor
ofTau Kappa Beta, you moron.

33:53.921 --> 33:57.357
He's gettin' the exam.

34:01.762 --> 34:04.060
<i>[Elizabeth]</i>
<i>Knut!</i>
Scooter?

34:04.131 --> 34:06.793
Knut, here!
Sam, he's okay!
He came back to the frat house!

34:06.868 --> 34:09.803
We gotta get you and Elizabeth
out of here!
I can't! Somebody else might come in here.

34:09.871 --> 34:11.804
What's the combination?
Right 28.

34:11.873 --> 34:15.001
Left 7.
Right 13.

34:15.076 --> 34:17.943
I mean, 19!
[Stammering]

34:18.012 --> 34:20.446
Okay, 28, 7, 19.
Hurry up, Sam!

34:21.315 --> 34:23.612
Nineteen...

34:24.619 --> 34:26.610
<i>[Al]</i>
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

34:29.523 --> 34:31.717
<i>[Al]</i>
<i>We've got four minutes</i>
<i>and 37 seconds.</i>

34:31.792 --> 34:34.351
Do you know how
to take this thing apart?
No.

34:34.428 --> 34:37.591
Uh, Duck made it.
Hang on. Look. See that
blue grommet on the top there?

34:37.665 --> 34:40.929
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Don't touch it.
That's the trigger device.

34:41.002 --> 34:43.493
Probably.
Famous last words.

34:43.571 --> 34:47.563
You've gotta cut four wires,
in sequence, in about five seconds.
Cut?

34:47.641 --> 34:50.873
You got anything to cut with
in there? Five seconds?
Uh, no.

34:50.945 --> 34:52.879
Yes, five seconds.
No, I don't.

34:52.947 --> 34:56.507
Try the lab, Sam. Get something
in there. Get two scissors,
because she's gotta help you.

35:06.727 --> 35:08.490
Come on, Sam.
[Beeping]

35:15.603 --> 35:18.094
Here. Take one.
All right.

35:18.172 --> 35:20.902
Okay, now...
white, red, blue, orange.

35:20.975 --> 35:23.307
White, red, blue orange.
Three minutes, 52 seconds.

35:23.377 --> 35:25.971
You gotta cut these,
but do 'em in the order
I tell you to, okay?

35:26.047 --> 35:27.981
Have her do the white and red.
You do the white and the red.

35:28.049 --> 35:30.415
And you do
the blue and the orange.
Do the blue and the orange.

35:30.484 --> 35:32.748
Ready?
Do it! Do it!

35:34.522 --> 35:36.046
[Sam] White.
<i>[Elizabeth]</i>
<i>White.</i>

35:36.123 --> 35:38.387
- Red.
- Red.

35:38.459 --> 35:42.327
Blue, orange.

35:42.396 --> 35:44.523
Orange.
Get the orange!

35:44.598 --> 35:46.623
<i>[Al]</i>
<i>Hurry, Sam!</i>
Orange.

35:48.369 --> 35:50.462
Ahh!

35:50.538 --> 35:53.939
[Gasping]
Oh, thank God.

35:54.008 --> 35:56.408
Oh, thank God.
You can say that again.

35:56.477 --> 35:59.708
You did it, Sam!
Only three minutes
and 25 seconds left.

35:59.780 --> 36:02.840
Twenty-four, 22, 20...

36:02.917 --> 36:05.943
Sam, it's still counting down!
That's impossible.

36:06.020 --> 36:07.681
What's impossible?
Unless...

36:07.755 --> 36:10.849
Unless Duck didn't trust her
and there's <i>...</i> two bombs!
Two bombs!

36:10.925 --> 36:14.156
Two bombs?

36:14.228 --> 36:17.197
- Duck!
- Good job.

36:18.599 --> 36:20.829
Tell me where the other bomb is.
What are you talking about?

36:20.901 --> 36:22.994
Duck, I told him.
He said somebody
was gonna get killed.

36:23.070 --> 36:25.561
Three minutes and eight seconds.
Sam, we gotta get out of here.
And you believed him?

36:25.639 --> 36:27.368
Tell me where the other bomb is.
I'm not tellin' you anything.

36:27.441 --> 36:30.103
Duck, please! Stop it!

36:30.177 --> 36:32.338
You're not gettin' out of here
until you tell me where
the other bomb is.

36:32.413 --> 36:36.713
Man, you really are crazy.
That's why they call me
the Wild Thing.

36:36.784 --> 36:39.344
Knut!

36:49.296 --> 36:53.232
Hey!
Get him, Wild Thing!
Hit him in the head!

36:53.300 --> 36:56.030
<i>Hit him!</i>
<i>Get his legs!</i>

36:56.103 --> 36:59.368
<i>Fifty seconds, Sam!</i>
<i>Knock off theJohn Wayne stuff.</i>

36:59.440 --> 37:02.000
We gotta get out of here.
Bone-crusher.

37:02.076 --> 37:04.374
<i>Come on, Wild Thing!</i>

37:04.445 --> 37:08.040
Give him the head thing
with the knuckle.
Do the knuckle thing.

37:08.115 --> 37:12.211
- Everybody get out of here!
- Stop it! Let's get out of here!

37:13.320 --> 37:15.788
Spread out!

37:15.856 --> 37:18.051
<i>Let go! It's gonna take out</i>
<i>this whole top floor!</i>

37:18.125 --> 37:20.958
Thirty seconds, Sam!
Thirty seconds, Duck.

37:21.028 --> 37:23.428
You ready to die? Huh?
Come on, Duck.
Go to hell.

37:23.497 --> 37:26.762
Thing! Thing! Thing! Thing!
Thing! Thing! Thing! Thing!
<i>Come on, Duck.</i>

37:26.834 --> 37:30.326
<i>I'll stay in here with you.</i>
<i>Twenty-five seconds.</i>
<i>Come on, Duck. Where is it?</i>

37:30.404 --> 37:32.338
It's fail-safe, Sam!

37:32.406 --> 37:35.432
If that bomb goes off,
there's no time to get out of here.
We're all gonna go up!

37:35.509 --> 37:39.275
Twenty seconds, Duck!
It's taped to the back
of the oxygen tanks!

37:42.650 --> 37:46.518
Fifteen seconds, Sam!
Thirteen seconds, Sam.

37:46.587 --> 37:49.078
<i>Twelve, 11</i>...

37:49.156 --> 37:51.954
Hold it. Hold it still.
<i>Nine.</i>

- Two. One.

What's the matter?

38:37.571 --> 38:39.334
Uh,

38:39.406 --> 38:42.398
I keep thinking about
what almost happened.

38:42.476 --> 38:45.104
Elizabeth,
don't torture yourself.
Nobody got hurt.

38:45.179 --> 38:48.706
I know. I know.
But I really should've
listened to you.

38:48.782 --> 38:50.909
God, I am really almost
like my own father.

38:51.986 --> 38:54.511
Well, you know, maybe...
Maybe that's what this is all about.

38:54.588 --> 38:57.921
Only, you just got confused.
What do you mean?

38:57.992 --> 39:01.428
Well, I mean, what if...
what you were trying to do...

39:01.495 --> 39:04.293
on some subconscious level...

39:04.365 --> 39:08.165
was to try and get your parents
to notice you again?

39:08.235 --> 39:11.602
But I really do care
what's happening in Vietnam!
I-I know you do.

39:11.672 --> 39:15.870
And that's great.
But if you could get your parents
to notice your work against the war,

39:15.943 --> 39:19.640
then... they might
notice you too.

39:19.713 --> 39:22.705
Right?
I guess.

39:22.783 --> 39:26.184
Except this time,
you just got a little
carried away, that's all.

39:26.253 --> 39:28.187
[Sighs]
Yeah.

39:28.255 --> 39:31.713
You know, I have to tell you that
one day this war's gonna end...

39:31.792 --> 39:34.124
because people like you
keep chipping away at it.

39:34.195 --> 39:38.154
And that's the only way
you're gonna break through
to your parents too... inch by inch.

39:38.232 --> 39:41.099
So don't give up, all right?
On either of'em.

39:42.269 --> 39:45.568
Okay.
Okay.

39:45.639 --> 39:47.937
Gee, enough boredom
and boring speeches.

39:48.008 --> 39:50.033
You wanna dance?
Sure.

39:50.110 --> 39:52.340
Come on.

39:52.413 --> 39:54.574
What?
Sorry, man.

39:54.648 --> 39:58.880
It's showtime!

Wild Thing! Wild Thing!
Wild Thing! Wild Thing!

40:02.256 --> 40:04.247
Al, what's happening?

40:04.325 --> 40:08.557
Elizabeth goes back to her parents
and ends up a major player
in helping to stop the war!

40:08.629 --> 40:12.087
Then I should be leaping!
Yeah, but first
you got to change!

40:12.166 --> 40:15.602
- Change?
- Maybe you're here
to do something else.

40:15.669 --> 40:18.832
I summon thee,

40:18.906 --> 40:23.366
O God of the Luau!

40:23.444 --> 40:27.210
[Low Chanting]

40:29.116 --> 40:31.243
Al, this is ridiculous.

40:31.318 --> 40:33.411
I don't know, Sam.
Looks pretty neat.

40:33.487 --> 40:36.285
Why haven't I leaped?

40:38.993 --> 40:42.690
Uh, Ziggy says
you gotta jump in the pool first.

40:48.168 --> 40:51.331
You serious?
Yeah.

40:51.405 --> 40:54.203
It seems when Knut did it,
uh, he missed.

40:55.376 --> 40:58.402
Uh-oh.
<i>It left him paralyzed.</i>

40:58.479 --> 41:01.505
Come on.
It's just a couple of feet.

41:01.582 --> 41:04.346
Well, it only takes a teaspoon
of water to drown you.

41:04.418 --> 41:07.182
- He drowned?
- No.

41:07.254 --> 41:09.347
No.
He broke his neck.

41:27.308 --> 41:32.007
I am the great Tau-waii...

41:32.079 --> 41:36.448
Kappa-lua Beta-Hiti,

41:36.517 --> 41:38.382
God of the Luau.

[All Barking]

41:42.389 --> 41:45.381
Let no man refuse...

41:45.459 --> 41:47.893
my hospitality tonight,

41:47.961 --> 41:51.590
lest he shall be forced to suffer...

41:51.665 --> 41:57.103
through the deaths
of a thousand limbos!

41:57.171 --> 41:59.196
[All]
Ooh!

42:00.841 --> 42:02.775
- Bimbo.
- Limbo.

42:02.843 --> 42:04.504
Bimbo.
Lim...

42:04.578 --> 42:08.275
Therefore, my children, go.

42:08.349 --> 42:11.318
Eat with your fingers.

42:11.385 --> 42:14.582
Drink with your toes.

42:14.655 --> 42:16.850
<i>Dance with your lips...</i>

42:16.924 --> 42:20.758
until the dawn smiles down...

42:20.828 --> 42:24.355
upon your warm,
unconscious bodies.

42:24.431 --> 42:27.730
I am...

42:27.801 --> 42:30.429
Tau-waii,

42:30.504 --> 42:33.337
the great Kappa-lua...

42:33.407 --> 42:35.341
Beta-Hiti,

42:35.409 --> 42:40.312
God of the Luau,
and I leave you with this message!

42:40.381 --> 42:44.909
T.K.B. is the life for me!

42:44.985 --> 42:47.886

What the...

43:03.604 --> 43:06.038
<i>T.K.B. is the life for me!</i>
Uh-oh.

43:06.106 --> 43:08.904
<i>T.K.B. is the life for me!</i>

43:08.976 --> 43:11.945
<i>T.K.B. is the life for me!</i>

<i>[Al] Oh, now I know</i>
<i>how Knut broke his neck.</i>

43:15.149 --> 43:17.674
<i>T.K.B. is the life for me!</i>
Sam!

43:17.751 --> 43:19.946

If you wanna leap,
you gotta leap.

That is my Queen T-shirt!
It's not yours, jerk!

44:12.005 --> 44:13.996
Read my lips, barf-head.

44:14.074 --> 44:17.305
That's my shirt,
and I want it back.
<i>[Child] Mommy!</i>
