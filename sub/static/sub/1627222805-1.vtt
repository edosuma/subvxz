02:11.958 --> 02:14.426
Honey, don't forget to
bear those heirloom tomatoes

02:14.493 --> 02:15.928
that Jeb promised
us on your way back,

02:15.995 --> 02:18.765
I want to get those
canned up this week.

02:28.040 --> 02:29.474
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

02:32.044 --> 02:32.979
This is not bacon.

02:34.346 --> 02:36.916
You know what Dr. Kilian
said, your bacon days are over.

02:36.983 --> 02:38.751
I'm the only guy
in the entire block

02:38.818 --> 02:42.621
that has a prescription
for oatmeal, soggy oatmeal.

02:42.688 --> 02:44.891
- It's not!
- It is, what kind of berries?

02:44.957 --> 02:47.359
- Hey!
- Perfect timing!

02:51.596 --> 02:53.766
Oh, come give your
grandma some sugar.

02:53.833 --> 02:55.600
Grandma!

02:55.668 --> 02:56.769
- Hey.
- Hi, good morning.

02:56.836 --> 02:58.738
Good morning, really?

02:58.805 --> 03:00.305
That's just what I needed.

03:01.439 --> 03:02.809
You only love
me for my coffee.

03:02.875 --> 03:04.476
- Just wake up?
- No.

03:04.543 --> 03:06.045
Do not let him fool you,

03:06.112 --> 03:08.613
he did not wake up
until we pulled in.

03:08.681 --> 03:10.783
Really? Is that a fact?

03:10.850 --> 03:12.018
Yeah, he slept
the whole way here.

03:12.084 --> 03:14.519
Kiddo, go get your stuff,
help grandpa load up.

03:14.586 --> 03:15.655
Come on, let's go!

03:15.721 --> 03:17.023
Katie girl, will you
come help me finish

03:17.089 --> 03:18.623
packing up their lunches?

03:19.859 --> 03:20.927
I'm guessing you
are done with that.

03:20.993 --> 03:22.695
I'm very done with that, yes.

03:22.762 --> 03:23.562
- It's good for you.
- Thank you.

03:23.629 --> 03:24.429
- You should eat it.
- Oh,

03:24.496 --> 03:26.666
well then it's good for you too.

03:26.732 --> 03:28.634
Come on kiddo, we're
burning daylight!

03:30.502 --> 03:33.072
Where are my binoculars?

03:33.139 --> 03:34.874
Okay, where was I?

03:39.946 --> 03:40.680
Hi mama.

03:40.746 --> 03:42.849
Hi sweetie, how are you?

03:43.950 --> 03:45.718
I am very tired.

03:45.785 --> 03:48.420
I wanted to come last
night but you know,

03:48.486 --> 03:50.690
I needed to pick
up an extra shift.

03:51.824 --> 03:55.895
Single mothers
just work too hard.

03:55.962 --> 03:59.065
I'm glad you're taking a few
days off and to stay with us.

04:00.199 --> 04:02.034
None of that is
for dad, right?

04:02.101 --> 04:03.236
No.

04:03.302 --> 04:07.907
This is Jessie's BLT and
then the rest is for us.

04:09.208 --> 04:10.743
You know, you need
to keep an eye on him.

04:10.810 --> 04:13.145
Oh, you are
preaching to the choir.

04:13.212 --> 04:16.380
Your father though, he
just loves his bacon.

04:19.652 --> 04:21.786
How are things going
at school, any better?

04:25.224 --> 04:26.726
Not really.

04:26.792 --> 04:28.127
The kids just keep
picking on him

04:28.194 --> 04:31.163
and I don't understand why.

04:31.230 --> 04:34.399
And you had the meeting with
the school and everything?

04:38.204 --> 04:41.539
You need your father to
call, you just let us know.

04:41.606 --> 04:43.508
I might take you up on that

04:43.575 --> 04:48.047
but I'm trying to let the
kids figure it out themselves.

04:48.114 --> 04:50.049
Well, we're here for you.

04:50.116 --> 04:52.151
I appreciate that, I know.

04:53.686 --> 04:55.620
You know, Jesse's been so
excited about this trip,

04:55.688 --> 04:57.890
it's all he's been
talking about all week.

04:57.957 --> 05:00.092
Your father been
just the same,

05:00.159 --> 05:03.162
he has been buzzing
off these walls.

05:03.229 --> 05:06.632
That boy just brings
him so much joy.

05:06.699 --> 05:08.134
So he's been
driving you crazy too?

05:08.200 --> 05:10.970
Yes.

05:11.037 --> 05:12.138
Better get this out to him.

05:12.204 --> 05:14.539
You know, he was ready
to leave an hour ago.

05:17.076 --> 05:18.510
Let's get them off.

05:19.946 --> 05:20.813
Okay!

05:22.148 --> 05:24.784
I got you two sandwiches for
you and grandpa for lunch

05:24.850 --> 05:27.987
but there's a BLT in
there for your breakfast.

05:28.054 --> 05:30.790
And I got you one of those
chocolate donuts you like

05:30.856 --> 05:33.292
but don't let your
grandpa get it.

05:33.359 --> 05:35.161
- Okay.
- Okay?

05:36.996 --> 05:38.530
Thank you.

05:38.596 --> 05:39.732
Give me a kiss.

05:41.067 --> 05:42.668
All right, put your belt on.

05:42.735 --> 05:43.601
Grandma!

05:45.905 --> 05:46.872
Hey kiddo.

05:46.939 --> 05:48.708
I want you to listen
to your grandpa

05:48.774 --> 05:49.875
and stay with him
the whole time, okay?

05:49.942 --> 05:52.745
- Okay.
- He's going to be fine.

05:52.812 --> 05:54.647
It's not like it's
the first time

05:54.714 --> 05:56.215
he's ever been hunting, right?

05:56.282 --> 05:57.615
I'll have him home tonight.

05:57.683 --> 06:00.219
- Bye dad.
- Bye daughter.

06:00.286 --> 06:01.988
- Bye wife.
- Bye husband.

06:09.762 --> 06:10.595
Grandpa!

06:11.697 --> 06:12.798
Grandma said no!

06:12.865 --> 06:14.700
Well, grandma's not
here right now, is she?

06:16.202 --> 06:18.503
Didn't anybody ever tell you

06:21.640 --> 06:25.044
that bacon is bad, bad for you?

06:25.111 --> 06:27.046
So I'm actually
doing you a favor.

06:30.182 --> 06:31.183
You're welcome.

07:18.264 --> 07:19.131
All right.

07:20.232 --> 07:21.967
There's a good spot.

07:25.237 --> 07:26.172
Okay.

07:26.238 --> 07:27.840
Said you gotta
go, so go, go, go!

07:44.423 --> 07:46.725
- Don't forget your backpack.
- I won't.

07:53.966 --> 07:55.034
Check this, please.

07:56.135 --> 07:56.969
Okay.

07:59.738 --> 08:00.739
- Clear.
- Clear.

08:03.209 --> 08:04.543
Excellent.

08:04.643 --> 08:07.146
All right, help me with this,
you know I can't reach here.

08:07.213 --> 08:08.647
Come on, jump, jump, jump!

08:09.415 --> 08:11.183
Oh, got it, good job!

08:14.019 --> 08:14.954
You got everything you need?

08:15.020 --> 08:15.888
Yep.

08:16.922 --> 08:17.790
Me too.

08:46.852 --> 08:47.953
All right, you see 'em?

08:54.059 --> 08:54.927
Yup.

08:59.798 --> 09:03.769
Go for that big buck
right off the main herd.

09:06.272 --> 09:07.139
Got 'em.

09:08.073 --> 09:09.341
Just like we trained.

09:11.277 --> 09:12.845
Slow breaths.

09:14.947 --> 09:17.950
And once you are
trained on your target,

09:18.017 --> 09:20.152
exhale, hold it.

09:21.353 --> 09:24.023
And when you're ready
to take the shot,

09:24.089 --> 09:25.191
you take the shot.

09:26.492 --> 09:28.260
Just like you taught me.

09:40.906 --> 09:42.041
You got him!

09:42.107 --> 09:43.375
All right, grab your gear,

09:43.442 --> 09:45.578
we got to start tracking
before we lose the blood trail.

09:49.515 --> 09:51.116
Came right up this deer trail.

09:52.084 --> 09:53.419
Watch yourself.

09:53.485 --> 09:55.754
That was a good shot.

09:58.524 --> 09:59.391
Look at here.

10:00.627 --> 10:01.727
We got blood.

10:05.264 --> 10:06.999
Which way do you think he went?

10:07.066 --> 10:09.168
Left.

10:09.235 --> 10:10.336
Left's good, come on.

10:12.972 --> 10:14.573
Hey, don't lag behind me.

10:14.641 --> 10:15.808
Come on, hurry up.

10:17.644 --> 10:18.712
Oh yeah.

10:20.980 --> 10:21.981
See this leaf?

10:23.115 --> 10:24.750
This leaf has more blood on it.

10:25.451 --> 10:27.019
See there how frothy it is?

10:27.086 --> 10:27.953
Yeah.

10:28.988 --> 10:30.956
It means you got
him in the lung.

10:41.033 --> 10:43.302
Yeah, I think we're right
up on him now sport!

10:55.514 --> 10:57.883
Jess, come on!

11:02.354 --> 11:05.257
Oh, what do we have here now?

11:05.324 --> 11:06.525
You see all this blood?

11:06.592 --> 11:07.559
Yeah.

11:07.627 --> 11:08.360
You see how the
leaves and the dirt

11:08.427 --> 11:10.863
are all kind of disturbed?

11:10.929 --> 11:15.167
That means he either stopped
here on purpose to take a rest

11:16.468 --> 11:17.569
or he fell down.

11:18.638 --> 11:19.673
Either way that's
great news for us.

11:19.739 --> 11:21.073
I want you to keep
your eyeballs peeled

11:21.140 --> 11:26.145
because I guarantee you he's
just up around the corner here.

11:26.211 --> 11:27.079
Collapsed.

11:33.252 --> 11:34.820
Grandpa, did you hear that?

11:48.334 --> 11:50.436
Come on, I won't hurt you.

11:53.972 --> 11:55.908
It's okay, see?
I won't hurt you.

11:57.376 --> 11:59.111
Wait, there's more!

12:01.146 --> 12:03.115
We're right on
top of him now boy

12:03.182 --> 12:05.184
and I'll tell you
what, he is a big one.

12:08.287 --> 12:09.521
Well, hey there big fella.

12:11.090 --> 12:12.858
Jess, come on,
you're gonna miss.

12:17.996 --> 12:18.864
Jess!

12:23.737 --> 12:26.639
Jess!

12:40.419 --> 12:42.287
Champ, you missed the best part!

12:44.156 --> 12:47.226
Hey, where'd you go champ?

12:52.097 --> 12:52.931
Wow!

13:03.509 --> 13:04.376
Jess!

13:06.578 --> 13:09.314
I'm gonna start
calling you donut boy.

13:12.584 --> 13:13.452
Jess!

13:25.564 --> 13:27.466
Where's my favorite grandson?

13:47.152 --> 13:48.020
Jess!

14:15.748 --> 14:17.650
Oh, there you are.

14:17.717 --> 14:18.984
What are you?

14:28.795 --> 14:31.698
Sure as hell thought I
taught you better than that.

14:35.735 --> 14:36.602
Oh.

14:43.609 --> 14:44.777
Jess?

15:14.573 --> 15:15.374
Jess!

15:16.709 --> 15:18.778
I'm sorry grandpa!

15:18.845 --> 15:20.412
No, Jess!

15:21.580 --> 15:23.115
Jess!

15:25.818 --> 15:27.352
Grandpa!

15:27.419 --> 15:29.054
What? No, no, no!

16:14.566 --> 16:16.101
I'm going to piss.

16:17.704 --> 16:18.638
All right, just make it quick

16:18.705 --> 16:20.172
'cause we're already
running late.

16:20.238 --> 16:21.708
Grab that quad breve.

16:21.774 --> 16:24.777
Wait, is that why you
wanted to stop here?

16:24.844 --> 16:25.945
What?

16:26.012 --> 16:27.714
No, I needed to piss.

16:27.780 --> 16:29.481
Just so happens this place
has really great coffee.

16:29.548 --> 16:30.783
Besides, it's going
to be five days

16:30.850 --> 16:32.384
before I can get another latte.

16:32.451 --> 16:33.552
Yeah, just hurry it up

16:33.619 --> 16:35.120
because they're probably
already waiting on us.

16:36.388 --> 16:37.623
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

16:41.393 --> 16:43.595
Hey, welcome to the Espresso
Chalet, what can I get ya?

16:43.663 --> 16:45.965
Can I get a quad breve latte?

16:46.032 --> 16:46.833
What size you need it in?

16:46.899 --> 16:51.603
Large and a large drip no room

16:51.671 --> 16:53.472
and one of these bad boys.

16:53.538 --> 16:54.406
Okay.

17:03.883 --> 17:05.450
Okay, here you go,
that'd be 8.50.

17:05.517 --> 17:07.686
Awesome, keep change.

17:07.753 --> 17:10.422
Thanks, where are
you boys heading?

17:10.489 --> 17:12.391
Oh, we're hiking
into Salta Sack.

17:12.457 --> 17:14.661
We're going to go the back
way off of highway 20.

17:14.727 --> 17:17.896
Salta Sack huh, aint
that like a 30 mile trek?

17:17.964 --> 17:19.766
Yes sir it is.

17:19.832 --> 17:21.500
Wow, it's beautiful out there.

17:21.566 --> 17:23.935
You guys geared up for that?

17:24.002 --> 17:26.304
Yeah, we've got
everything we need.

17:26.371 --> 17:27.140
Well be careful out there,

17:27.204 --> 17:28.641
there's a blood moon tonight.

17:28.708 --> 17:29.709
And you know what that means.

17:29.776 --> 17:32.577
I'm sorry, what
do you mean by that?

17:32.645 --> 17:34.647
People go missing
during a blood moon.

17:35.547 --> 17:37.249
Leave those boys alone.

17:37.315 --> 17:39.886
He likes to spread conspiracies.

17:39.952 --> 17:41.420
They're not conspiracies.

17:42.454 --> 17:43.690
Right.

17:43.756 --> 17:44.623
Okay.

17:45.825 --> 17:46.793
Time to go?

17:46.859 --> 17:47.827
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:48.861 --> 17:49.762
Thank you.

17:49.829 --> 17:51.229
- Have a nice hike.
- Thank you.

17:56.468 --> 17:58.871
Nick, come on man, let's
go, we're already late.

17:59.872 --> 18:00.740
In the truck.

18:01.808 --> 18:02.675
Alright.

18:03.743 --> 18:05.477
Good luck out there.

18:29.769 --> 18:31.637
- You okay man?
- Yeah.

18:34.640 --> 18:35.775
What's wrong?

18:35.842 --> 18:37.442
Nothing, I'm good.

18:37.509 --> 18:38.477
You look quiet.

18:40.646 --> 18:42.749
What the hell was all
that blood man stuff?

18:43.916 --> 18:45.317
I knew it.

18:45.383 --> 18:47.419
Man, you are an easy mark bro.

19:17.415 --> 19:18.651
- What happened?
- You're taking the blame.

19:18.718 --> 19:19.986
- Why me?
- Yeah.

19:24.123 --> 19:25.224
What's up?

19:25.290 --> 19:27.760
You're late but I will
probably forgive you.

19:27.827 --> 19:28.761
Hi, hi, hi!

19:29.962 --> 19:31.864
It's good to see you.

19:31.931 --> 19:33.498
Boys,

19:33.565 --> 19:35.902
this is my girlfriend, Jordan.

19:35.968 --> 19:37.637
Yeah, Jordan, how ya doing?

19:37.703 --> 19:38.905
I only do handshakes.

19:38.971 --> 19:40.873
Oh, all right,

19:40.940 --> 19:42.507
we can do that,
nice to meet you.

19:42.574 --> 19:43.776
Rebecca's told us all about you.

19:43.843 --> 19:44.944
Not everything I hope.

19:45.011 --> 19:46.679
Oh, everything.

19:48.147 --> 19:49.381
Okay, boys let's get the show
on the road, where's Chuck?

19:49.447 --> 19:52.384
Yeah, where the hell is
Chuck? He's never late.

19:52.450 --> 19:53.186
He's only, what, 10 minutes

19:53.252 --> 19:54.854
to the trail head, right?

19:54.921 --> 19:55.788
Yeah.

20:00.193 --> 20:01.727
Is that?

20:06.565 --> 20:07.800
Doug?

20:07.867 --> 20:10.670
Doug, you invited dirty
fucking Doug on this trip?

20:13.005 --> 20:14.106
Who's dirty Doug?

20:14.173 --> 20:16.608
You said you invited
Chuck, what the hell?

20:20.146 --> 20:21.814
Yeah, that's what I'm
trying to tell you guys.

20:21.881 --> 20:22.815
What are you
trying to tell us?

20:22.882 --> 20:24.217
Okay, Chuck
canceled last minute

20:24.283 --> 20:26.752
and Doug was just standing
there at the bar and you know,

20:26.819 --> 20:29.454
one thing led to another
and he took Chuck's place.

20:30.857 --> 20:32.091
Doug invited himself then.

20:32.158 --> 20:33.458
No.

20:33.525 --> 20:35.094
Well, yeah.

20:36.062 --> 20:36.863
Don't give me that look, man,

20:36.929 --> 20:38.731
you know I can't say no to Doug.

20:38.798 --> 20:40.565
Who wants to fuck?

20:40.633 --> 20:42.101
Oh God.

20:42.168 --> 20:44.103
Yeah bro, I'm good.

20:44.170 --> 20:46.105
- I only do handshakes.
- I'm sorry

20:47.673 --> 20:50.743
for all of what's about
to happen because of you.

20:51.644 --> 20:52.410
You parked in two spots,

20:52.477 --> 20:54.446
you parked in two spots, man!

20:56.182 --> 20:57.449
Let's go boys.

20:57.515 --> 20:59.852
I guess 20 miles aint going
to hike themselves, right?

20:59.919 --> 21:02.387
Oh, Uncle Seth
cookie, this is good.

21:03.689 --> 21:06.558
Hey, I'll eat this, you
burn off calories, fat boy.

21:06.625 --> 21:08.728
Oh, this is my nightmare.

21:08.794 --> 21:09.896
Karma's a bitch, huh?

21:11.764 --> 21:12.665
Lock the trunk.

21:34.253 --> 21:35.121
Dick.

22:24.870 --> 22:28.506
Oh, so how long have
you two been doing it?

22:29.308 --> 22:30.409
You're so gross.

22:30.475 --> 22:32.577
Do you mean how long
have we been together?

22:33.980 --> 22:35.580
He's just jealous.

22:35.648 --> 22:36.614
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:37.950 --> 22:40.886
No, not about the jealous
part, but the together part.

22:40.953 --> 22:42.554
- You know something Doug?
- What?

22:42.620 --> 22:43.789
You're beginning
to grow on me.

22:43.856 --> 22:45.791
Ah, see?

22:45.858 --> 22:48.160
- The romance begins.
- Swear to God.

23:14.720 --> 23:15.855
Nope.

23:25.398 --> 23:27.967
Hey, hey, how much
longer do we got?

23:28.034 --> 23:29.668
Seriously bro?

23:32.204 --> 23:35.741
Okay, we've been
hiking for five hours.

23:35.808 --> 23:37.710
That's like 10, 12 miles.

23:37.777 --> 23:39.078
We still have another five to go

23:39.145 --> 23:40.980
before we even hit first camp.

23:41.047 --> 23:41.914
First camp?

23:43.816 --> 23:44.817
Come on.

23:44.884 --> 23:46.285
Buddy, we talked about this.

23:46.352 --> 23:48.354
We do the bigger
chunk today, 15 miles.

23:48.421 --> 23:51.157
Tomorrow we do the second half,
13 miles to camp Mananall.

23:51.223 --> 23:52.291
Come on, you got this?

23:53.225 --> 23:54.193
I believe in you.

23:56.128 --> 23:57.229
Come on pussy!

23:57.296 --> 23:58.898
- Doug.
- Fuck you, man.

23:58.964 --> 24:01.801
Fuck you, man.

24:03.035 --> 24:04.904
You guys are so
mean to each other.

24:23.222 --> 24:24.490
Hey man.

24:24.557 --> 24:27.159
All right, let's just take
like a quick little break,

24:27.226 --> 24:28.360
let's all catch our breath, huh?

24:28.427 --> 24:29.261
Sounds good to me man.

24:29.328 --> 24:30.595
Let me help you.

24:35.434 --> 24:36.302
Oh, Jesus.

24:37.169 --> 24:38.938
What do you have in here, rocks?

24:41.173 --> 24:42.942
This thing weighs
like 50 pounds.

24:43.008 --> 24:44.710
Did you not follow
my weight restrictions

24:44.777 --> 24:45.711
and packing guide?

24:45.778 --> 24:47.279
Totally, I just,

24:47.346 --> 24:50.282
I may have added a few extra
items to the list though.

24:51.383 --> 24:54.220
He didn't weigh his pack.

24:54.286 --> 24:56.355
This right here is like
five pounds alone man.

24:56.422 --> 24:57.556
You don't even need that.

24:57.622 --> 25:00.726
All right, let's see
what else is in there.

25:00.793 --> 25:02.361
No, that's
totally unnecessary.

25:02.428 --> 25:03.896
We're totally doing that.

25:13.772 --> 25:14.740
Three?

25:14.807 --> 25:16.008
You brought three
pairs of jeans?

25:16.075 --> 25:17.309
No way.

25:17.376 --> 25:18.677
We're only out for five
days, you know that right?

25:18.744 --> 25:21.914
Who wears jeans to hiking,
let alone brings four pairs

25:21.981 --> 25:22.948
for five days?

25:23.015 --> 25:24.049
Hold on.

25:24.116 --> 25:25.951
Why do I even bother
giving you lists?

25:27.820 --> 25:29.822
Dude, I just got that tent.

25:29.889 --> 25:31.824
- Oh shit!
- What?

25:32.958 --> 25:34.293
You're not going to
believe this cookie boy.

25:34.360 --> 25:35.761
What is it?

25:43.169 --> 25:44.403
What?

25:44.470 --> 25:45.804
Wait, is that?

25:49.074 --> 25:49.975
Is this my knife?

25:54.480 --> 25:55.814
Wow.

25:55.881 --> 25:57.149
Okay, I'll tell you what, this
is what we're going to do.

25:57.216 --> 25:59.418
I'm going to take your pack,
you're going to take mine

25:59.485 --> 26:00.586
but we're leaving
behind this chili,

26:00.654 --> 26:03.455
the three pairs of jeans
and this big ass tent.

26:03.522 --> 26:04.790
We'll share my two man.

26:04.857 --> 26:06.792
Not my chili, I'll carry that.

26:06.859 --> 26:08.527
It's the only thing
I brought to eat.

26:08.594 --> 26:10.396
No, you're going
to take all this shit

26:10.462 --> 26:12.264
and stash it behind a rock
or a tree or something.

26:12.331 --> 26:14.900
We'll get it in a couple of
days on our way back out.

26:14.967 --> 26:18.037
We set out on a 30 mile
hike and you brought 10 pounds

26:18.103 --> 26:19.038
of chili with you?

26:20.072 --> 26:22.007
It's eight pounds
and I love chili.

26:22.074 --> 26:23.809
Dude, I love chili
too but there's no way

26:23.876 --> 26:25.144
I'm going to pack all this.

26:26.312 --> 26:27.379
This is what I'm gonna
do, I'm going to take

26:27.446 --> 26:29.148
four of these cans
from you, all right?

26:29.215 --> 26:30.983
- Thanks Doug.
- Go fuck yourself.

26:34.987 --> 26:36.388
Where's my water?

26:36.455 --> 26:38.290
I don't know, maybe
in the chili pile?

26:38.357 --> 26:40.092
Probably in chili.

26:59.411 --> 27:02.214
Holy shit, come
check this out.

27:13.025 --> 27:13.892
Whoa.

27:15.961 --> 27:18.130
What is this thing?

27:18.197 --> 27:20.499
Looks like some sort of
beavers nest or something.

27:20.566 --> 27:24.203
You idiot, beavers don't
build nests, they build dams.

27:24.270 --> 27:27.006
We're not even close to
the water so that's not it.

27:27.072 --> 27:28.274
This is freaky.

27:29.241 --> 27:31.043
- Let's go.
- Yes please.

27:32.311 --> 27:33.747
I think it's pretty cool.

27:37.416 --> 27:40.185
Last time I was in the
beavers nest, it was your mom.

28:00.205 --> 28:01.507
You eating that cold
right out of the can?

28:01.573 --> 28:03.442
Oh yeah, I love it.

28:03.509 --> 28:04.343
Obviously.

28:04.410 --> 28:05.511
Hey!

28:05.577 --> 28:07.379
Don't eat my chili, man!

28:07.446 --> 28:09.448
Sorry chili boy,
this is my Sherpa tax.

28:09.515 --> 28:11.350
Oh, hey baby,
your shoe is untied.

28:11.417 --> 28:12.284
Oh.

28:14.219 --> 28:15.354
What do you mean tax?

28:17.356 --> 28:18.624
Dude, come on man,

28:18.692 --> 28:20.559
I only brought enough for
me to have two cans a day!

28:20.626 --> 28:24.063
Nope, nope, I'll give
you a can of my strogan,

28:24.129 --> 28:24.997
that way you won't go hungry.

28:25.064 --> 28:28.233
Do you even know
what strogan is?

28:28.300 --> 28:29.568
I actually don't.

28:57.262 --> 28:58.130
Hey!

29:20.552 --> 29:21.420
Rebecca?

29:55.454 --> 29:56.321
Rebecca?

29:58.658 --> 29:59.591
Rebecca!

29:59.659 --> 30:02.662
Hey, are you
hurt? Are you okay?

30:02.729 --> 30:04.329
I really think we have to go.

30:06.432 --> 30:07.099
Dude, she's freaking out.

30:07.166 --> 30:09.134
Rebecca, what'd you see?

30:09.201 --> 30:10.235
What's going
on? What happened?

30:10.302 --> 30:12.004
- You didn't see the lady?
- What lady?

30:12.070 --> 30:13.405
Rebecca, what are
you talking about?

30:13.472 --> 30:14.239
What do you mean what lady?

30:14.306 --> 30:15.675
She walked right through you!

30:15.742 --> 30:16.608
I didn't see any lady.

30:16.676 --> 30:17.644
Is she hot?

30:20.345 --> 30:22.080
Rebecca, tell us what you saw.

30:25.317 --> 30:27.219
Blood and her feet-

30:28.487 --> 30:30.155
- Nobody walked by us, I
mean, I would have seen that.

30:30.222 --> 30:32.157
We haven't seen anybody
since this morning.

30:33.358 --> 30:34.426
This is ridiculous.

30:34.493 --> 30:35.961
I'm going to see you
guys up on the trail.

30:37.162 --> 30:39.198
Hey, hey, when was the
last time you had water?

30:39.264 --> 30:41.266
I don't want
any fucking water!

30:41.333 --> 30:43.035
I'm trying to tell
you there is a lady

30:43.101 --> 30:44.603
and she's walking,
she's covered in blood

30:44.671 --> 30:46.706
and she was barefoot.

30:46.773 --> 30:47.841
Okay, now I'm getting scared.

30:47.907 --> 30:50.743
Okay, everyone needs
to just calm down.

30:50.810 --> 30:53.545
Hey look, just drink a
little bit of this, all right?

30:53.612 --> 30:54.513
Drink some water.

30:55.481 --> 30:56.482
Here, let me see that.

30:59.752 --> 31:01.821
Okay cool, so we're
all good now, right?

31:08.661 --> 31:10.062
Oh my God, Doug!

31:12.231 --> 31:13.666
Doug!

31:13.733 --> 31:14.600
Here's his shirt.

31:20.840 --> 31:22.307
There's his pack!

31:27.379 --> 31:28.247
This is weird.

31:29.883 --> 31:32.584
Is it his water bottle?

31:37.222 --> 31:38.791
Holy shit.

31:45.430 --> 31:46.733
Doug!

31:51.436 --> 31:52.271
Doug!

31:56.508 --> 31:57.844
Ola bitches!

31:57.911 --> 31:59.378
Fuck.

31:59.444 --> 32:02.815
Why don't you get
in? This is nice.

32:02.882 --> 32:03.750
All right.

32:09.254 --> 32:10.622
I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

32:10.690 --> 32:14.326
Why not?

32:14.393 --> 32:17.129
Oh Jesus, oh shit.

32:17.195 --> 32:20.432
That's why.

32:20.499 --> 32:21.300
Bro.

32:21.366 --> 32:22.301
What?

32:22.367 --> 32:23.535
Dude no, on you.

32:25.571 --> 32:26.238
What the fuck!

32:26.305 --> 32:27.740
Get it off, get it off!

32:27.807 --> 32:28.908
Get it the fuck off me!

32:28.975 --> 32:31.410
- Come on, get em off!
- Who has the lighter?

32:31.476 --> 32:33.880
Who the fuck has a lighter,
why do you need a lighter?

32:33.947 --> 32:36.481
So how are we gonna get
those bastards off then?

32:36.548 --> 32:37.917
Fine, it's in my shorts!

32:37.984 --> 32:39.652
Oh God, oh God.

32:43.488 --> 32:44.824
Stand still.

32:44.891 --> 32:46.425
Yeah, I am!

32:46.491 --> 32:48.628
Oh wait, wait, wait.

32:48.695 --> 32:49.929
Just let me check something.

32:49.996 --> 32:50.797
Look that way.

32:56.501 --> 32:57.870
Yeah I'm good, okay.

32:57.937 --> 32:58.805
Get them off me.

33:01.607 --> 33:03.475
- No!
- Fuck you man.

33:04.844 --> 33:05.845
Fuck you, man.

33:05.912 --> 33:07.847
Okay, so word to the wise,

33:07.914 --> 33:09.916
most of these Alpine
lakes have leeches in them

33:09.983 --> 33:11.084
so check before you jump.

33:11.149 --> 33:13.786
Yeah, great information,
help me please!

33:13.853 --> 33:16.188
God, do it, do it, do it!

33:23.830 --> 33:25.464
How much farther we got
til we break for camp?

33:25.530 --> 33:27.199
Seriously?

33:27.265 --> 33:28.400
- Seriously?
- What?

33:28.467 --> 33:29.702
I got all these slimy
cocksuckers all over me,

33:29.769 --> 33:31.704
you're worried about how
many miles it is to camp?

33:31.771 --> 33:33.271
It's that many.

33:33.338 --> 33:34.473
- But I was just-
- Just,

33:34.539 --> 33:36.408
- just about two miles that way.
- Stand still.

33:36.475 --> 33:37.609
I am!

33:37.677 --> 33:39.378
- I was just trying to-
- I was just trying to.

33:40.647 --> 33:42.314
- Nevermind.
- Yeah, nevermind.

33:46.518 --> 33:47.654
This one's killing me,
this one's killing me,

33:47.720 --> 33:50.322
this one's killing me,
this one's killing me.

33:50.389 --> 33:51.289
Nope, nope, nope.

33:53.291 --> 33:54.593
Get it, get it.

33:54.661 --> 33:55.762
Don't do that.

34:43.109 --> 34:45.577
Into where I needed to go.

34:48.413 --> 34:49.347
Josh, what's up?

34:50.750 --> 34:52.719
I don't know.

34:52.784 --> 34:55.955
He keeps wanting
more and more and more.

35:07.667 --> 35:08.433
I'm gonna do this, okay?

35:08.500 --> 35:09.568
We're going to figure it out.

35:09.635 --> 35:12.772
This can't just keep
happening like this.

35:20.612 --> 35:21.981
Everything pushes away-

35:22.048 --> 35:23.783
- Dude, this guy's tripping out.

35:23.850 --> 35:25.651
He's fucking losing it.

35:26.686 --> 35:27.987
What is he talking about?

35:29.055 --> 35:30.455
I don't know.

35:30.522 --> 35:31.523
Right here okay?

35:31.590 --> 35:33.860
Right here, right here.

35:33.926 --> 35:36.461
I just don't know what to do.

35:37.395 --> 35:38.664
Let me talk to him.

35:38.731 --> 35:39.999
That's what I'm
saying to you, okay?

35:40.066 --> 35:41.100
What're you gonna say?

35:41.167 --> 35:42.135
If you'd want to
hear me, that's fine.

35:42.201 --> 35:43.002
If you don't want
to listen to me,

35:43.069 --> 35:45.570
that's your problem, not mine.

35:45.638 --> 35:46.605
But we have to change because
I've tried to make it work,

35:46.672 --> 35:48.540
I tried to make
it work, I tried.

35:48.607 --> 35:50.009
Yeah.

35:50.076 --> 35:51.610
Yes, I know we have to,

35:51.677 --> 35:52.879
we have to figure out
a way to make it work.

35:52.945 --> 35:55.081
We're going to figure out
a way to make it work.

35:55.148 --> 35:56.749
We're going to make
it work together.

35:56.816 --> 35:57.683
Okay.

35:58.851 --> 36:00.619
We're going to do this.

36:00.686 --> 36:02.354
It's going to finally stop,
it's going to finally stop.

36:06.159 --> 36:07.827
You didn't mean it.

36:07.894 --> 36:09.729
You love her.

36:09.796 --> 36:11.697
We can get through
this, can't we hun?

36:12.832 --> 36:14.499
Is everything okay?

36:14.566 --> 36:16.068
Oh my God, miss?

36:16.135 --> 36:18.004
We can get through
this, can't we hun?

36:18.070 --> 36:18.738
Miss?

36:21.874 --> 36:23.075
We can get through this.

36:23.142 --> 36:24.376
What the shit?

36:24.442 --> 36:25.577
Are you guys lost?

36:25.645 --> 36:27.046
It's okay, it's okay.

36:27.113 --> 36:29.381
She's just hungry, that's all.

36:29.447 --> 36:30.415
Everything is going to be fine.

36:30.482 --> 36:31.117
Miss, show me
where you've hurt.

36:31.184 --> 36:32.852
Just give her time.

36:34.120 --> 36:36.421
Oh fuck man, your head!

36:38.191 --> 36:39.158
Hey, grab the first aid kit,

36:39.225 --> 36:41.426
this dude took a
spill or something.

36:42.695 --> 36:44.096
Oh my God guys, this is bad.

36:45.530 --> 36:48.000
Yes, I know, I know, I know.

36:48.067 --> 36:52.071
I know that it hurts, but
it's best not to upset it.

36:53.605 --> 36:55.440
Hurry up with that kit.

36:58.878 --> 37:00.947
That's her, that's her!

37:05.218 --> 37:06.752
What's she saying,
I can't make it out?

37:06.819 --> 37:07.787
I don't fucking know,

37:07.854 --> 37:08.855
I got my own shit
going on over here!

37:08.921 --> 37:11.958
Oh God, what are
we going to do now?

37:12.024 --> 37:12.758
What are we going to do now?

37:12.825 --> 37:15.027
Everybody is going to know!

37:15.094 --> 37:16.062
Oh my God.

37:16.128 --> 37:18.998
Oh my God please,
God please help me.

37:19.065 --> 37:20.166
Please help me.

37:20.233 --> 37:22.500
We're here to help,
just tell us what to do.

37:25.805 --> 37:27.874
Oh my God, it's a baby.

37:30.142 --> 37:31.711
What the fuck is that man?

37:31.777 --> 37:33.679
What did you do?

37:33.746 --> 37:34.579
No, stop!

37:34.647 --> 37:35.314
Hey buddy.

37:35.413 --> 37:36.682
Take it easy, calm down.

37:36.749 --> 37:37.850
- Calm down.
- What?

37:39.517 --> 37:40.186
Who are you?

37:40.253 --> 37:41.754
How did you get in here?

37:41.821 --> 37:44.589
You shouldn't be in
here, get out of here!

37:44.657 --> 37:45.624
We ain't going nowhere man.

37:45.691 --> 37:47.059
We're all right
here in the woods.

37:50.997 --> 37:52.131
You kids need
to run along now.

37:52.198 --> 37:54.499
This is a family matter!

37:54.566 --> 37:56.903
We're not gonna run
along, we're right here.

37:56.969 --> 37:59.138
- Whoa!
- Hey, okay!

37:59.205 --> 38:00.206
You heard me!

38:00.273 --> 38:01.140
Calm down.

38:02.174 --> 38:03.342
- I said leave!
- Okay, hey look,

38:03.408 --> 38:05.610
- we need to go, now.
- We just wanted to help.

38:05.678 --> 38:07.046
You're not welcome here!

38:07.113 --> 38:07.914
Hey, that's not needed.

38:07.980 --> 38:09.649
Okay, we're leaving, calm down.

38:09.715 --> 38:13.418
Oh God!

38:17.957 --> 38:19.025
I told you to leave.

38:19.091 --> 38:21.894
I told to leave us
alone, leave us alone,

38:21.961 --> 38:25.563
leave us alone,
please leave us alone!

38:25.631 --> 38:26.866
No, no, no!

38:30.670 --> 38:31.569
I told you.

38:32.939 --> 38:34.740
This is a family matter!

38:57.330 --> 38:58.596
Go, go, go!

39:43.042 --> 39:44.710
Shit.

39:44.777 --> 39:45.644
What?

39:47.279 --> 39:48.613
I forgot Nick's pack.

39:49.315 --> 39:50.182
What?

39:51.217 --> 39:52.084
You doing okay?

39:52.985 --> 39:54.619
I want to go home.

39:54.687 --> 39:56.989
Oh man, I can't believe
you left my stuff.

40:00.993 --> 40:02.962
It's a lost cause now
cause ain't no one of us

40:03.029 --> 40:05.297
going to go back
there and get that.

40:05.364 --> 40:06.432
What was that man?

40:06.499 --> 40:08.367
It's the fucking
lady I told you about-

40:08.434 --> 40:09.635
- No, I'm not talking
about the lady,

40:09.702 --> 40:11.737
I'm talking about the thing
that she was holding up

40:11.804 --> 40:12.604
in her hand.

40:12.671 --> 40:14.807
Yeah, that was a baby right?

40:14.874 --> 40:17.143
Like, please tell
me that was a baby.

40:17.209 --> 40:18.778
Oh my God, my heart
is going so fast,

40:18.844 --> 40:20.079
I don't feel so good.

40:20.146 --> 40:23.649
All right look, maybe we
can like skirt around it

40:24.817 --> 40:26.152
and then we can get
down to the mountain

40:26.218 --> 40:28.154
and we could call
someone, right?

40:28.220 --> 40:30.156
It's too late in
the day to go back.

40:30.222 --> 40:31.657
It'll be dark soon.

40:31.724 --> 40:32.725
Do you want to go
back the way we came

40:32.792 --> 40:34.260
and risk bumping into
them in the dark?

40:34.326 --> 40:38.664
No.

40:38.731 --> 40:39.331
No.

40:39.398 --> 40:40.633
You guys.

40:40.699 --> 40:42.001
Let's just set up camp here.

40:49.809 --> 40:52.044
What the fuck is going on?

40:59.919 --> 41:00.886
What happened?

41:00.953 --> 41:02.288
What did you see?
You can tell me.

41:02.354 --> 41:03.588
I knew what I saw, but I want
to know what all of you saw.

41:03.656 --> 41:07.093
Hey, leave her alone,
she's been through enough.

41:07.159 --> 41:08.260
- What?
- Hey, Nick.

41:09.795 --> 41:10.629
Stop!

41:11.931 --> 41:14.599
You're going to be okay,
we're all going to be okay.

41:15.501 --> 41:16.769
But she's right, man.

41:16.836 --> 41:20.739
We got to set up camp and rest.

41:20.806 --> 41:22.174
- Rest?
- Yeah, fucking rest!

41:22.241 --> 41:23.409
Rest, yeah rest.

41:23.476 --> 41:26.145
You think anybody's going
to sleep after that?

41:26.212 --> 41:29.248
This is far from okay man!

41:29.315 --> 41:32.084
We just saw a dude shoot
himself in the face

41:32.151 --> 41:33.886
and it didn't even phase him!

41:33.953 --> 41:34.619
I know.

41:34.687 --> 41:36.288
I mean, what the fuck?

41:36.355 --> 41:38.124
Hey, you need to settle down.

41:38.190 --> 41:39.258
Settle down?

41:41.060 --> 41:42.161
Settle down?

41:43.062 --> 41:44.363
I should settle down!

41:44.430 --> 41:46.165
I'm going to show
you settle down.

41:46.232 --> 41:48.801
I'm going to settle my
ass the fuck out of here

41:48.868 --> 41:50.302
is what I should do, come on!

41:50.369 --> 41:52.238
Whoa, whoa.

41:52.304 --> 41:53.139
Hey.

41:53.939 --> 41:55.241
- Take a breath.
- Nick.

41:56.208 --> 41:57.042
Calm down.

41:58.177 --> 42:00.779
Okay, you're getting
worked up over nothing.

42:03.048 --> 42:04.083
Yeah, nope.

42:05.151 --> 42:07.720
What the fuck did
you just say to me?

42:07.786 --> 42:10.222
What the did he just
say? For nothing?

42:10.289 --> 42:11.257
Yeah.

42:11.323 --> 42:13.792
For nothing!
Hey, hey, just breathe!

42:13.859 --> 42:16.896
This is the most fucked
up shit I have ever seen!

42:16.962 --> 42:21.967
And you all, you all are acting
like seeing a maggot baby

42:23.335 --> 42:25.905
and a man shooting
himself in the head

42:25.971 --> 42:28.674
as a normal fucking
day of hiking!

42:31.210 --> 42:32.077
It's not!

42:37.349 --> 42:38.217
Fuck!

42:56.235 --> 42:57.102
Nick.

42:58.971 --> 43:00.406
Your food was in the pack, man.

43:01.907 --> 43:02.875
It's all right,
it's all right,

43:02.942 --> 43:05.110
you can have one
of my stroges bro.

43:05.177 --> 43:09.281
Plus, I got these
bad boys right here.

43:11.584 --> 43:12.451
Really Doug?

43:14.019 --> 43:15.321
Are you stupid?

43:15.387 --> 43:17.456
No, you're not getting high!

43:17.523 --> 43:18.824
Okay?

43:18.891 --> 43:20.125
I don't need you tripping balls
in the middle of the woods

43:20.192 --> 43:23.395
singing kumbaya on the
fucking campfire, you idiot!

43:24.463 --> 43:25.331
Okay mom.

43:26.966 --> 43:28.834
What am I going
to sleep in, man?

43:28.901 --> 43:29.902
It's okay.

43:29.969 --> 43:31.403
Hey, you can share
your bed with me.

43:33.105 --> 43:33.973
Thanks.

43:36.375 --> 43:38.244
Actually, I'm good.

43:38.310 --> 43:40.246
I got my space blanket, man.

43:40.312 --> 43:42.047
You can take the bag.

43:42.114 --> 43:43.148
We're in the two man.

43:44.917 --> 43:45.751
We'll be fine.

43:47.886 --> 43:49.755
All right, we're going
to get some firewood.

43:51.156 --> 43:52.224
You want to come with me?

43:53.459 --> 43:55.394
All right, I'll be back.

43:55.461 --> 43:56.262
Be safe.

43:57.463 --> 44:00.899
We're going to set up
camp, just take it easy.

44:05.504 --> 44:08.841
You gonna be all
right? Just breathe.

45:06.999 --> 45:09.368
Would anybody care for some tea?

45:10.502 --> 45:13.105
Nope and you've
probably had enough.

45:13.172 --> 45:15.574
It's a microdose but
I think I'm okay dad.

45:15.642 --> 45:17.443
Sure, I'll have some.

45:17.509 --> 45:18.243
Yeah?

45:18.310 --> 45:20.045
Sure you want to do that?

45:20.112 --> 45:22.047
It's okay, that
will help me relax.

45:25.417 --> 45:27.386
- Thanks.
- Anybody else?

45:27.453 --> 45:28.320
Last call.

45:30.189 --> 45:31.357
No.

45:31.423 --> 45:32.424
Well, more for me.

45:33.459 --> 45:34.393
More for us.

45:38.263 --> 45:41.133
At least somebody
can sleep through this.

45:47.640 --> 45:49.308
Guys actually, I'm kind of done.

45:50.542 --> 45:51.778
You want to come?

45:51.845 --> 45:54.513
Yeah, in a bit, I'm going
to finish this tea first.

45:55.648 --> 45:58.183
- Goodnight y'all.
- Goodnight.

46:27.346 --> 46:29.047
Hey, you should get some rest.

46:31.049 --> 46:32.317
No, I can't sleep.

46:34.219 --> 46:36.488
I'll stay up, keep
the fire going.

46:47.767 --> 46:49.468
Well, I'm going to bed.

46:51.236 --> 46:52.571
- Hey!
- Hey.

46:52.639 --> 46:55.541
Give him a break in a sec
so he can get some rest, okay?

46:55.607 --> 46:56.810
Yes ma'am.

46:56.876 --> 47:01.280
- All right, goodnight guys.
- Goodnight darling.

47:06.552 --> 47:08.086
Won't you go rest up bubba?

47:11.423 --> 47:13.091
No, I'm good for a bit longer.

47:15.561 --> 47:18.230
Besides, sleeping beauty
back there is in my bag so.

47:20.399 --> 47:22.968
All right, well,
how about this?

47:25.304 --> 47:27.272
In a little bit I'll
change your place,

47:27.339 --> 47:31.109
so I'll tend the fire and
you can go sleep in my tent,

47:31.176 --> 47:33.646
sleep in my sleeping back, huh?

47:34.881 --> 47:35.748
How about that?

47:38.183 --> 47:39.284
I'm going to go lay down

47:39.351 --> 47:40.619
and trip some fucking balls

47:40.687 --> 47:43.522
'cause there's no way in
hell I could sleep right now.

47:45.457 --> 47:48.227
- Sounds good.
- All right, deal.

47:48.293 --> 47:49.161
Deal.

47:50.462 --> 47:51.997
Come with me my love.

50:04.262 --> 50:05.197
What the?

50:07.499 --> 50:08.567
Did you guys hear that?

50:11.370 --> 50:12.105
What was that?

50:13.338 --> 50:14.306
It kind of sounded like Doug

50:14.373 --> 50:16.475
but he's still in
there sleeping.

50:18.711 --> 50:19.578
Doug?

50:22.481 --> 50:23.348
Doug?

50:29.521 --> 50:30.522
He's not in there.

50:30.589 --> 50:32.825
What do you mean
he's not in there?

50:32.892 --> 50:34.027
Look, he was really high man,

50:34.093 --> 50:36.328
he might've went off and
wandered into the woods.

50:47.406 --> 50:48.675
Look at these markings.

50:48.741 --> 50:50.442
It's like he dragged his
sleeping bag in that direction.

50:50.509 --> 50:51.844
Why would he do that?

50:51.911 --> 50:54.781
Because he had way too many
mushrooms and he's an idiot?

50:56.983 --> 50:58.450
Didn't bring his headlamp?

50:59.584 --> 51:00.585
Maybe we should
go look for him.

51:00.653 --> 51:02.755
No way, we're safer
here by the fire.

51:05.490 --> 51:07.392
What do you think Nick?

51:07.459 --> 51:08.193
I don't think
we have a choice.

51:08.260 --> 51:09.696
I think we got to go him.

51:15.768 --> 51:16.769
Throw me his lamp.

51:21.573 --> 51:22.775
Come on.

51:22.842 --> 51:23.710
Doug?

51:24.711 --> 51:26.278
Fuck.

51:26.344 --> 51:27.747
Doug?

51:40.927 --> 51:41.761
Doug!

51:48.134 --> 51:49.434
Y'all.

51:49.501 --> 51:51.070
What, what is it?

51:51.137 --> 51:53.840
It's Doug's shoe, he
has to be around here.

51:53.906 --> 51:55.574
Doug!

51:55.641 --> 51:56.743
Here, let me see that.

51:58.010 --> 52:01.013
Man, it's definitely
his, what a fucking idiot!

52:01.080 --> 52:02.815
He has to be close.

52:02.882 --> 52:04.416
Doug!

52:28.674 --> 52:29.341
What's that?

52:31.878 --> 52:33.612
The trail just goes cold.

52:33.679 --> 52:35.648
See how are all these ferns
are smashed up to this point

52:35.715 --> 52:38.550
and then, nothing.

52:40.418 --> 52:41.854
It's like he just disappeared.

52:41.921 --> 52:43.455
Man, he didn't disappear.

52:43.522 --> 52:44.456
He's gotta to be
around here somewhere,

52:44.523 --> 52:46.826
so let's just split up.

52:47.794 --> 52:48.661
Look for signs.

52:50.428 --> 52:51.296
I'll go this way.

52:56.501 --> 52:57.335
Doug!

53:03.109 --> 53:04.143
Guys?

53:04.210 --> 53:05.577
I found his sleeping bag.

53:10.482 --> 53:11.651
What does this mean?

53:12.852 --> 53:14.553
I don't know but that's blood

53:14.619 --> 53:16.388
so he's clearly hurt.

53:16.454 --> 53:17.389
Where are you man?

53:18.390 --> 53:19.959
Looks like
something got to him.

53:20.026 --> 53:21.526
What do you mean something?

53:21.593 --> 53:23.029
Be specific, like an animal?

53:23.095 --> 53:25.430
I don't know Nick, but
it doesn't look good.

53:25.497 --> 53:26.766
Shut up!

53:26.833 --> 53:29.401
I swear to God from here if
we go south, there's a road

53:29.467 --> 53:30.535
and if we go
northeast on the road,

53:30.602 --> 53:31.704
there's a ranger station.

53:31.771 --> 53:32.404
Why are you talking
about a ranger station?

53:32.470 --> 53:33.739
We have to find Doug!

53:33.806 --> 53:36.608
Would've been a lot easier
if you hadn't lost the map!

53:36.676 --> 53:37.643
Lost the map?

53:37.710 --> 53:39.578
The map that is
back at the campfire

53:39.645 --> 53:40.746
where I said we were safe?

53:40.813 --> 53:41.881
Map, that map?

53:41.948 --> 53:43.481
You could be taking
further to the woods-

53:43.548 --> 53:44.416
- Look!

53:46.953 --> 53:48.654
There's a light.

53:51.691 --> 53:53.659
That's gotta be Doug, right?

53:53.726 --> 53:55.427
We gotta find out.

53:57.163 --> 54:00.532
That just sounds
stupid to me but fuck.

54:05.805 --> 54:06.672
Doug!

54:10.243 --> 54:11.110
Whoa.

54:13.913 --> 54:14.814
What the?

54:15.781 --> 54:18.617
What is powering that?

54:20.052 --> 54:22.587
That's a very good question.

54:22.655 --> 54:23.956
Josh, any ideas?

54:24.824 --> 54:25.691
No.

54:28.593 --> 54:29.427
Josh.

54:31.230 --> 54:32.932
Josh, this just
doesn't feel right,

54:32.999 --> 54:34.133
none of this makes sense.

54:34.200 --> 54:35.902
Josh, come down, please!

54:37.169 --> 54:40.538
Dude, this is crazy!

54:40.605 --> 54:43.575
I mean we're like
deep in the cascades.

54:43.643 --> 54:46.712
What, like 50 miles from
another human being?

54:46.779 --> 54:48.513
Who do you think built these?

54:48.580 --> 54:50.716
Or better yet, how did they
get the materials out here?

54:50.783 --> 54:53.886
Okay, this gives me
the heebie-jeebies.

54:53.953 --> 54:55.688
What are you, scared of
some stairs in the woods?

54:55.755 --> 54:57.622
It's not exactly the
stairs that are scary.

54:57.690 --> 55:00.625
It's that they're in the
middle of the woods with power.

55:00.693 --> 55:04.797
Yeah it's like, the lights
are on when no one's home, huh?

55:04.864 --> 55:06.666
You're hysterical,
could you please come down

55:06.732 --> 55:08.167
so we could go find Doug?

55:09.168 --> 55:11.536
Josh, listen to me.

55:11.603 --> 55:14.040
I just, I have a bad feeling
about this, all right?

55:14.106 --> 55:18.044
We need to go and
find Doug, please.

55:21.613 --> 55:23.182
Yeah, you're right, I'm sorry.

55:23.249 --> 55:24.317
But I will tell you,

55:24.383 --> 55:26.052
nobody's going to
believe us about this.

55:26.118 --> 55:28.020
I'm okay with that, let's go!

55:28.087 --> 55:29.989
I mean, there's not
even like a pine needle

55:30.056 --> 55:34.226
or a leaf or a speck
of dust, it's crazy.

55:36.996 --> 55:37.863
Thank you.

55:38.764 --> 55:40.598
- Grandpa!
- Jess!

55:49.709 --> 55:50.443
Guys!

55:50.508 --> 55:51.644
There's a door back here!

55:51.711 --> 55:54.814
Leave at Josh,
we got to go find Doug.

55:58.084 --> 55:59.819
There's somebody in here!

55:59.885 --> 56:00.753
Is it Doug?

56:05.623 --> 56:06.892
I mean, it's gotta be Doug.

56:08.294 --> 56:09.561
What are you doing?

56:11.897 --> 56:12.999
All right, step back.

56:21.674 --> 56:22.775
Are you okay?

56:24.643 --> 56:25.911
Yeah, I think so.

56:28.114 --> 56:30.216
All right, I'm
coming bro, hold on.

56:30.282 --> 56:31.917
Okay.

56:31.984 --> 56:32.852
Oh shit.

56:40.259 --> 56:42.128
What the hell?

56:52.905 --> 56:54.006
Hey, is he okay?

56:55.775 --> 56:57.143
Is Doug down there?

56:57.209 --> 56:58.677
It's pretty dark to tell.

56:59.812 --> 57:01.280
Looks like it goes
way back though.

57:01.347 --> 57:03.082
All right, let's go.

57:03.149 --> 57:04.884
Let's get you up, come on.

57:04.950 --> 57:07.987
Come on.

57:10.189 --> 57:11.123
That's it, come on.

57:17.696 --> 57:18.563
Come on.

57:20.366 --> 57:21.767
- You sure.
- Yup.

57:29.375 --> 57:31.310
Did you hear that?

57:31.377 --> 57:32.645
What is it?

57:33.679 --> 57:35.247
I don't know,
we heard a voice.

57:37.016 --> 57:38.818
It's gotta be Doug.

57:41.854 --> 57:46.358
All right, we got to go find
him, we can't leave him here.

57:46.425 --> 57:48.294
We'll be right back.

57:51.330 --> 57:52.765
Ready?

57:52.832 --> 57:53.699
Yeah.

58:00.272 --> 58:01.140
Doug?

58:02.875 --> 58:04.009
Doug?

58:13.285 --> 58:14.453
Doug?

58:14.520 --> 58:15.988
Sorry.

58:25.097 --> 58:26.298
Is it safe?

58:28.434 --> 58:31.103
Jesus, it's a fucking kid.

58:31.170 --> 58:32.238
Grandpa Jean?

58:32.304 --> 58:33.906
What? No kid.

58:33.973 --> 58:34.940
Who are you?

58:35.007 --> 58:36.208
Where's grandpa Jean?

58:38.944 --> 58:42.815
I don't know kid but we're
the only people down here.

58:42.882 --> 58:44.283
But he was just here.

58:48.921 --> 58:49.889
He found us.

58:50.823 --> 58:51.857
What, who?

58:51.924 --> 58:52.992
Who, your grandpa Jean?

58:53.058 --> 58:55.161
No, the bad man.

59:00.332 --> 59:01.834
Wait, hey kid!

59:03.802 --> 59:04.670
Kid!

59:05.938 --> 59:06.872
Whoa, whoa.

59:13.345 --> 59:15.014
What is this place?

59:16.815 --> 59:17.950
No idea.

59:21.554 --> 59:23.222
The fuck is that?

59:24.356 --> 59:25.958
I don't know.

59:26.025 --> 59:29.762
Let's just find the kid
and get out of here.

59:32.464 --> 59:33.332
Kid.

59:43.242 --> 59:44.376
Kid, hey, hey.

59:48.914 --> 59:50.382
The fuck is that?

59:50.449 --> 59:52.851
It's one of the hunters.

59:52.918 --> 59:54.853
What do you mean hunters?

59:58.390 --> 59:59.892
Nick, get over here, stop.

01:00:02.895 --> 01:00:06.065
He's close, do you
know where the door is?

01:00:06.131 --> 01:00:07.466
Wait, what?

01:00:07.533 --> 01:00:11.003
It always changes the door,
it's never in the same spot.

01:00:12.871 --> 01:00:14.306
What do you mean it changes?

01:00:14.373 --> 01:00:16.408
We literally just
came through the door.

01:00:17.409 --> 01:00:19.144
- You did?
- Yeah.

01:00:19.211 --> 01:00:22.248
- Can you take me there?
- Yes, come on.

01:00:22.314 --> 01:00:23.415
- Yeah, let's go.
- Let's go.

01:00:23.482 --> 01:00:24.350
Go, go, go.

01:00:32.891 --> 01:00:34.193
Hey, wait, wait.

01:00:35.561 --> 01:00:37.229
Are you sure it's that way?

01:00:37.296 --> 01:00:39.498
I think we came from that way.

01:00:39.565 --> 01:00:40.966
No, we passed that tank.

01:00:42.134 --> 01:00:44.169
The tank, there's a
hundred of those tanks.

01:00:49.241 --> 01:00:50.075
Trust me.

01:00:55.147 --> 01:00:56.282
I'm gonna go.

01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:06.058
This way.

01:01:30.215 --> 01:01:32.484
Hey kid, what's wrong?

01:01:33.952 --> 01:01:35.421
What are you doing?

01:01:37.956 --> 01:01:40.192
Holy shit!

01:01:42.194 --> 01:01:44.263
Come on! Come on!

01:01:44.330 --> 01:01:45.297
Take the kid!

01:01:45.364 --> 01:01:46.332
Who's that?

01:01:46.398 --> 01:01:48.133
It doesn't matter,
just take him!

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.501
What are you doing? Come on!

01:01:50.569 --> 01:01:52.304
I don't hear it.

01:01:52.371 --> 01:01:53.572
I think we lost it.

01:01:58.577 --> 01:02:00.512
Oh my God, Josh!

01:02:00.579 --> 01:02:01.447
Fuck!

01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:04.216
Oh shit!

01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:12.391
Where's Josh?

01:02:14.761 --> 01:02:15.961
He's gone.

01:02:16.628 --> 01:02:17.664
Josh is gone.

01:02:17.731 --> 01:02:19.331
Okay, look at me.

01:02:19.398 --> 01:02:21.166
- Stop, we have to leave.
- No.

01:02:21.233 --> 01:02:24.937
We're getting out of
these fucking woods and go!

01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:22.662
No guys stop, wait!

01:03:22.729 --> 01:03:23.797
He's behind us.

01:03:23.863 --> 01:03:24.631
You guys stay here, I'm
going to go get him.

01:03:24.697 --> 01:03:27.166
No! We're coming with you.

01:03:27.232 --> 01:03:29.568
Turn your light off, the moon
is out, we can see just fine.

01:03:29.636 --> 01:03:31.437
Don't want that thing
to see where we are.

01:03:41.748 --> 01:03:43.282
What the?

01:03:59.398 --> 01:04:00.265
Nick.

01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:03.569
What the fuck? What happened?

01:04:03.636 --> 01:04:04.436
Hey, are you okay?

01:04:04.503 --> 01:04:05.370
Yeah.

01:04:06.673 --> 01:04:08.675
I just fell on some
sort of mud puddle.

01:04:08.741 --> 01:04:09.809
Oh God, that's not mud,

01:04:09.876 --> 01:04:11.510
what the hell is that smell?

01:04:11.577 --> 01:04:13.111
I don't know.

01:04:13.178 --> 01:04:16.348
Something died,
bones everywhere.

01:04:31.664 --> 01:04:33.733
I want to go home.

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.434
Let's find that road.

01:04:35.501 --> 01:04:37.469
Yeah, it's back that way.

01:04:50.148 --> 01:04:51.718
It's not just Doug.

01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:55.354
What?

01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:56.789
There are other people here.

01:05:08.701 --> 01:05:10.602
I'm sorry man.

01:05:34.326 --> 01:05:35.327
Run!

01:05:35.394 --> 01:05:36.261
Run!

01:05:37.229 --> 01:05:38.463
Oh God!

01:05:38.530 --> 01:05:39.331
It's coming, hurry!

01:05:39.398 --> 01:05:40.265
Go, go!

01:05:43.502 --> 01:05:44.503
Which way?

01:05:46.906 --> 01:05:48.373
Over there!

01:05:57.215 --> 01:05:58.051
Run!

01:05:59.886 --> 01:06:02.454
Let's go to the other side!

01:06:03.422 --> 01:06:05.324
This is locked too!

01:06:07.392 --> 01:06:08.695
Come on!

01:06:08.761 --> 01:06:10.529
- Rebecca!
- Rebecca hurry!

01:06:10.596 --> 01:06:12.732
Rebecca, come on!

01:06:14.901 --> 01:06:15.768
No!

01:06:39.391 --> 01:06:41.193
Do you see it?

01:06:41.259 --> 01:06:43.128
Jordan, do you see it?

01:06:52.404 --> 01:06:53.271
No.

01:07:06.551 --> 01:07:07.920
Oh God, oh God!

01:07:16.595 --> 01:07:17.730
He won't leave.

01:07:18.698 --> 01:07:19.699
They never do.

01:07:21.433 --> 01:07:24.603
It's always hungry, it
has to feed its kids.

01:07:25.838 --> 01:07:26.939
Kids?

01:07:27.006 --> 01:07:28.074
Yes.

01:07:28.141 --> 01:07:30.777
And they always cry and
cry in the darkness,

01:07:30.843 --> 01:07:32.812
always hungry, always searching.

01:07:34.647 --> 01:07:36.683
Everything in the
darkness is hunting.

01:07:38.718 --> 01:07:40.552
To survive, you
have to keep moving.

01:07:47.359 --> 01:07:50.429
How did you survive
all this time?

01:07:57.070 --> 01:07:58.403
Get the car!

01:08:54.026 --> 01:08:58.930
Josh was a notorious
prankster when we grew up.

01:09:00.767 --> 01:09:05.772
He always found ways to
mess with me and my friends.

01:09:06.671 --> 01:09:08.741
He would scare us all the time.

01:09:11.077 --> 01:09:12.544
And as I got older,

01:09:15.081 --> 01:09:16.948
I learned to stand up to him

01:09:17.015 --> 01:09:19.551
and I would retaliate.

01:09:21.654 --> 01:09:22.621
And of course, Josh,

01:09:22.688 --> 01:09:24.924
he would always
have to one up me,

01:09:29.962 --> 01:09:31.395
but he was my brother.

01:09:32.832 --> 01:09:34.332
He was always there for me.

01:09:37.737 --> 01:09:40.840
I'm sure you can imagine
but I was picked on as a kid

01:09:40.907 --> 01:09:43.575
and when I got picked on,

01:09:43.643 --> 01:09:45.745
Josh, he was there
to settle the score.

01:09:47.647 --> 01:09:48.781
He would help me with my tests

01:09:48.848 --> 01:09:52.718
and always made sure we
had dinner on the table

01:09:52.785 --> 01:09:56.689
because our parents worked
two jobs just to pay rent.

01:09:56.756 --> 01:10:01.761
And Josh, he just took that
role and then in college.

01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:10.803
For all of his faults,
he was still my brother.

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:15.007
And he loved me.

01:10:18.911 --> 01:10:19.979
And now I can't,

01:10:22.982 --> 01:10:24.583
I can't repay him.

01:10:29.055 --> 01:10:31.023
I just left him there die!

01:10:32.925 --> 01:10:34.392
To die by that thing!

01:10:42.268 --> 01:10:45.671
- We did everything we could.
- Oh, I don't know.

01:10:45.738 --> 01:10:48.107
Everything happened so fast.

01:10:48.174 --> 01:10:49.675
All we could do is run

01:10:50.877 --> 01:10:52.577
or that thing would
have killed us all.

01:10:58.084 --> 01:11:01.654
You did the right thing Nick.

01:11:03.022 --> 01:11:04.690
You did the right thing.

01:11:07.793 --> 01:11:10.562
You can repay him by
getting us out of here.

01:11:18.938 --> 01:11:19.772
Yeah.

01:11:51.203 --> 01:11:53.205
Hey, I just realized we
don't know your name kid.

01:11:53.272 --> 01:11:58.210
Jesse.

01:12:07.253 --> 01:12:08.921
Jesse?

01:12:08.988 --> 01:12:09.855
Yeah?

01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:17.529
You said your
grandpa's name was Jean?

01:12:17.595 --> 01:12:18.731
Yeah, grandpa Jean.

01:12:21.667 --> 01:12:22.600
What is it Nick?

01:12:28.908 --> 01:12:29.574
Jesse,

01:12:32.345 --> 01:12:35.181
is your last name Martin?

01:12:36.315 --> 01:12:38.784
Yeah, grandpa Jean
says it was Scottish.

01:12:39.919 --> 01:12:44.724
I know this kid, but
that can't be, that was-

01:12:45.791 --> 01:12:47.492
- What are you
talking about Nick?

01:12:48.794 --> 01:12:52.031
Jesse, did you have a
friend in school named

01:12:54.934 --> 01:12:55.768
Nicholas?

01:12:57.236 --> 01:12:59.504
Yeah, Nicholas Reed.

01:13:00.639 --> 01:13:02.842
We're both in Mr.
Jenson's class.

01:13:02.908 --> 01:13:05.277
He lived two blocks down,
he came over all the time.

01:13:05.344 --> 01:13:07.713
Oh my God.

01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:08.681
What is it?

01:13:08.748 --> 01:13:09.614
That's me.

01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:12.952
I'm Nicholas Reed.

01:13:13.019 --> 01:13:14.053
Nicholas?

01:13:16.022 --> 01:13:16.989
Oh my God.

01:13:19.191 --> 01:13:20.059
No.

01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:22.728
This can't-

01:13:22.795 --> 01:13:24.630
- What are you talking about?

01:13:24.697 --> 01:13:27.033
Okay, so when I
was in grade school,

01:13:27.099 --> 01:13:28.901
there was a kid in my
class who went missing.

01:13:28.968 --> 01:13:30.736
Everyone blamed his
grandfather for losing him

01:13:30.803 --> 01:13:33.139
but when neither one
of them returned,

01:13:33.205 --> 01:13:34.874
headlines went to foul play.

01:13:36.442 --> 01:13:37.676
My friend,

01:13:40.012 --> 01:13:40.946
Jessie Martin

01:13:43.115 --> 01:13:45.651
and his grandfather were
never heard from again.

01:13:51.190 --> 01:13:52.458
Wait a minute.

01:13:52.525 --> 01:13:57.329
Okay, you're saying Jesse
went missing in the nineties?

01:13:57.396 --> 01:13:58.631
Yeah.

01:13:58.697 --> 01:14:03.702
He hasn't aged a day in
the past 20 some odd years?

01:14:07.139 --> 01:14:08.374
Like he time traveled?

01:14:08.441 --> 01:14:09.642
No.

01:14:09.708 --> 01:14:11.043
How is this even possible?

01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:12.378
It's not possible
and there's no way

01:14:12.445 --> 01:14:13.412
that he could time travel

01:14:13.479 --> 01:14:16.082
but when I went
inside those stairs,

01:14:18.918 --> 01:14:20.286
it's like I was
transported somewhere else.

01:14:20.352 --> 01:14:23.289
It's like I was brought
to a different dimension

01:14:23.355 --> 01:14:25.925
and I know that that
sounds really weird saying

01:14:25.991 --> 01:14:27.359
but I don't know.

01:14:29.995 --> 01:14:32.098
There are many
openings in the darkness.

01:14:32.164 --> 01:14:34.333
We never went towards them
because of all the things

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:35.968
that hunted down there.

01:14:39.238 --> 01:14:40.106
We?

01:14:41.373 --> 01:14:43.242
Who else was down
there with you?

01:14:43.309 --> 01:14:44.276
Grandpa Jean.

01:14:46.212 --> 01:14:49.281
Then I lost him and the
grub daddies almost got me.

01:14:50.883 --> 01:14:52.284
So I had to get
through the opening

01:14:52.351 --> 01:14:54.286
and that's when you
guys pulled me out.

01:14:56.222 --> 01:14:58.357
You said grub daddies?

01:14:58.424 --> 01:14:59.391
Yeah.

01:14:59.458 --> 01:15:00.693
There's more than one?

01:15:00.759 --> 01:15:02.294
Yeah, that's what I call them.

01:15:02.361 --> 01:15:03.696
They looked like the little bugs

01:15:03.762 --> 01:15:05.698
that grandma complained always
about eating in her garden.

01:15:08.033 --> 01:15:10.903
What? I don't hear anything.

01:15:10.970 --> 01:15:11.837
Exactly.

01:15:13.305 --> 01:15:14.306
I think it left.

01:15:21.113 --> 01:15:23.349
It never leaves once
it gets the scent.

01:15:23.415 --> 01:15:25.885
It's what grandpa Jean said.

01:15:27.186 --> 01:15:28.821
Hey, I think maybe
we should check.

01:15:28.888 --> 01:15:31.323
Yeah, that's a great idea.

01:15:31.390 --> 01:15:33.225
Windows right there,
you can be my guest.

01:15:33.292 --> 01:15:34.226
- Please.
- Fuck that.

01:15:34.293 --> 01:15:35.594
Are you insane?

01:15:35.661 --> 01:15:38.397
There's no fucking way I'm
ever going to fucking go there.

01:15:38.464 --> 01:15:39.999
- Language.
- Sorry kid.

01:15:46.205 --> 01:15:47.072
All right, fine.

01:15:48.474 --> 01:15:50.676
Let's do this together,
I'll back you up.

01:16:44.463 --> 01:16:45.699
What are you doing?

01:16:45.764 --> 01:16:48.534
I'm looking for anything
we can use as a weapon.

01:16:48.601 --> 01:16:49.835
We can't hide in here forever,

01:16:49.902 --> 01:16:50.936
that thing knows we're in here

01:16:51.003 --> 01:16:52.571
and it's just waiting
for us to slip up!

01:16:52.639 --> 01:16:54.340
Here, you can use this.

01:16:54.406 --> 01:16:56.275
My grandpa gave her
to me for my birthday.

01:16:56.342 --> 01:16:57.943
Why don't you hold
onto that one kid?

01:16:58.010 --> 01:16:59.478
I'm looking for something
a little bit bigger.

01:16:59.545 --> 01:17:00.980
Jordan, check the front.

01:17:03.616 --> 01:17:05.317
Check the front!

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.002
Oh, this is a good sign.

01:17:23.068 --> 01:17:25.170
Yes, are there any bullets?

01:17:33.479 --> 01:17:34.346
Bingo.

01:17:36.282 --> 01:17:37.082
Four shelves.

01:17:37.149 --> 01:17:38.984
It's not going to be enough.

01:17:39.051 --> 01:17:40.953
It's better than nothing.

01:18:07.313 --> 01:18:08.314
He can hear us.

01:18:09.481 --> 01:18:11.083
He can smell real good too.

01:18:17.356 --> 01:18:18.991
I've got an idea.

01:18:20.326 --> 01:18:22.828
Jordan, I need you and
Jesse to make some noise.

01:18:24.229 --> 01:18:25.297
Just to distract long enough

01:18:25.364 --> 01:18:27.132
for me to open up the side door.

01:18:27.199 --> 01:18:28.434
Are you sure about this?

01:18:29.736 --> 01:18:30.602
No.

01:18:32.404 --> 01:18:33.939
But we need to try something.

01:18:35.642 --> 01:18:36.508
Anything.

01:18:38.745 --> 01:18:40.279
- You're with me?
- Yes.

01:18:41.681 --> 01:18:43.115
- You good?
- Yes.

01:18:44.516 --> 01:18:46.820
Peel on back, side wall.

01:18:49.588 --> 01:18:50.456
On my cue.

01:18:52.124 --> 01:18:53.092
Go.

01:19:14.346 --> 01:19:16.148
Okay, it worked, all right.

01:19:17.650 --> 01:19:19.351
It looks like we only have
one more shot at this.

01:19:19.418 --> 01:19:20.886
All right, listen up.

01:19:21.755 --> 01:19:23.021
While Jesse distracts
the creature.

01:19:23.088 --> 01:19:24.623
- Grub daddy.
- Grub daddy.

01:19:24.691 --> 01:19:27.559
Yes, while Jesse
distracts the grub daddy,

01:19:27.626 --> 01:19:28.360
this time, Jordan,

01:19:30.295 --> 01:19:32.097
I need you to come out with me

01:19:32.164 --> 01:19:35.033
with the shotgun and I
need you to shoot it.

01:19:36.235 --> 01:19:37.536
I'd love to.

01:19:37.603 --> 01:19:38.604
You gotta make sure
you have a clear shot

01:19:38.671 --> 01:19:40.539
'cause we only have
those four shelves.

01:19:40.606 --> 01:19:42.174
I've got this.

01:19:42.241 --> 01:19:43.375
You're good?

01:19:44.276 --> 01:19:46.445
Yeah.

01:19:46.512 --> 01:19:48.113
All right.

01:19:51.316 --> 01:19:52.217
Go.

01:19:55.587 --> 01:19:57.156
Wait for it.

01:20:29.856 --> 01:20:31.256
Fuck, safety.

01:20:34.259 --> 01:20:35.527
Jordan.

01:20:40.667 --> 01:20:41.500
Jordan!

01:20:42.635 --> 01:20:47.640
Jordan no!

01:21:11.196 --> 01:21:13.465
Somebody help me!

01:21:15.802 --> 01:21:17.469
Please!

01:21:17.536 --> 01:21:19.706
This could work,
this is gonna work.

01:21:22.207 --> 01:21:24.076
Kid, once I go out there

01:21:24.142 --> 01:21:26.512
I need you to come
and lock this door.

01:21:26.578 --> 01:21:27.513
If it gets me,

01:21:30.282 --> 01:21:32.752
stay here until you're
certain it's gone.

01:21:32.819 --> 01:21:33.720
Okay Nick.

01:21:43.228 --> 01:21:45.030
Over here you son of a bitch!

01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:54.473
Goddam it!

01:22:04.751 --> 01:22:06.585
Who's the daddy now, bitch?

01:23:16.521 --> 01:23:18.357
Can we go home now?

01:23:29.401 --> 01:23:30.268
Yeah.

01:23:32.371 --> 01:23:33.840
Let's get out of here.

01:23:55.293 --> 01:23:55.895
Yes.

01:23:58.563 --> 01:23:59.464
Yeah, he's here.

01:24:02.869 --> 01:24:04.403
I will.

01:24:04.469 --> 01:24:05.337
Yes sir.

01:24:06.706 --> 01:24:07.840
Yeah, we'll be here.

01:24:07.907 --> 01:24:08.775
Okay.

01:24:09.976 --> 01:24:11.610
The mother and grandmother
are on their way.

01:24:11.678 --> 01:24:12.945
That's so weird.

01:24:13.012 --> 01:24:15.882
I must have looked at that
file photo a hundred times

01:24:15.948 --> 01:24:17.416
and that's definitely the kid.

01:24:17.482 --> 01:24:19.484
I mean, that's him, isn't it?

01:24:19.551 --> 01:24:20.987
Yeah, that's him.

01:24:21.054 --> 01:24:23.255
Everyone in town knows about it.

01:24:23.321 --> 01:24:24.556
How long ago was that?

01:24:27.359 --> 01:24:28.460
20 years.

01:24:38.738 --> 01:24:40.605
How's that hot
chocolate, any good?

01:24:41.506 --> 01:24:42.374
I guess.

01:24:44.010 --> 01:24:45.878
Needs more marshmallows though.

01:24:52.852 --> 01:24:53.953
So did you get up there?

01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:55.587
Oh, we got up there all right.

01:24:55.655 --> 01:24:56.956
It ain't good.

01:24:57.023 --> 01:24:59.391
Looks like some animal tore
through those kids up there.

01:24:59.458 --> 01:25:01.359
- You found the brother?
- No, sir.

01:25:02.561 --> 01:25:03.996
Oh ma'am, sorry.

01:25:06.398 --> 01:25:07.566
No trace of the brother

01:25:07.633 --> 01:25:09.501
means we have to question
the survivors more.

01:25:12.105 --> 01:25:13.271
Hey.

01:25:13.338 --> 01:25:15.407
You want me to come
fishing with me sometime?

01:25:16.575 --> 01:25:17.576
That would be fun.

01:25:18.978 --> 01:25:20.245
Sure.

01:25:20.312 --> 01:25:23.015
So I take it you didn't
find any stairs and monsters?

01:25:23.082 --> 01:25:25.584
Yeah, no stairs, no
monsters, crop circles,

01:25:25.651 --> 01:25:27.019
alien aircraft.

01:25:27.086 --> 01:25:30.555
Although it did smell
a little squatchy.

01:25:30.622 --> 01:25:34.426
Now, what we did find
was a big ash pile.

01:25:34.493 --> 01:25:36.028
Definitely some
smoking going on.

01:25:36.095 --> 01:25:38.563
It could have been a
bonfire, I'm just saying.

01:25:38.631 --> 01:25:39.999
Pretty sure drugs were involved.

01:25:40.066 --> 01:25:41.734
I know someone was tripping.

01:25:41.801 --> 01:25:43.335
Why?

01:25:43.401 --> 01:25:45.004
Did you find anything
to support your claim?

01:25:45.071 --> 01:25:46.139
Drugs, paraphernalia?

01:25:46.205 --> 01:25:48.507
No, no, I did not
find a bag of mushrooms.

01:25:48.573 --> 01:25:49.574
No indeed.

01:25:49.642 --> 01:25:51.343
I didn't mention
a bag of mushrooms.

01:25:52.477 --> 01:25:53.746
Oh, you know,
I just remembered

01:25:53.813 --> 01:25:55.347
- I left something in my car.
- What?

01:25:55.413 --> 01:25:57.884
It just dawned on me.

01:25:57.950 --> 01:25:58.818
Here, could you hold it?

01:25:58.885 --> 01:26:00.619
I'll just be a sec.

01:26:00.686 --> 01:26:01.620
The fuck?

01:26:23.575 --> 01:26:24.944
This is my brother's knife.

01:26:28.648 --> 01:26:29.649
Want you to have it.

01:26:33.986 --> 01:26:35.387
Are you sure?

01:26:35.453 --> 01:26:36.454
It's your brother's.

01:26:40.092 --> 01:26:40.960
Yeah.

01:26:51.671 --> 01:26:52.537
Jesse?

01:26:57.475 --> 01:26:58.343
Jesse!

01:26:59.212 --> 01:27:00.780
Jesse?

01:27:00.847 --> 01:27:01.714
Mom?

01:27:04.050 --> 01:27:04.917
Mom?

01:27:09.487 --> 01:27:10.355
Jesse.

01:27:15.493 --> 01:27:16.361
Jesse.

01:27:19.999 --> 01:27:21.167
Jesse?

01:27:21.234 --> 01:27:22.101
Mom?

01:27:23.002 --> 01:27:25.872
- Hey baby, it's me.
- Mom!

01:27:25.938 --> 01:27:30.009
I missed you so much!

01:27:35.513 --> 01:27:36.381
Jesse.

01:27:43.956 --> 01:27:44.824
Grandma?

01:27:51.097 --> 01:27:51.964
My boy.

01:28:02.875 --> 01:28:05.244
Grandma, I'm sorry.

01:28:05.311 --> 01:28:06.679
I lost grandpa.

01:28:07.813 --> 01:28:10.582
I couldn't find
him, it was dark.

01:28:20.326 --> 01:28:23.195
It's not your fault, okay?

01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:27.465
Grandpa's sorry he
forgot the tomatoes.

01:28:35.174 --> 01:28:38.510
Mom.

01:28:38.576 --> 01:28:39.812
Hey Nick.

01:28:39.879 --> 01:28:42.447
We're going to have to ask
you some more questions.

01:28:43.716 --> 01:28:46.185
Yeah, can you just
give me one second?

01:28:46.252 --> 01:28:47.753
I'm afraid I must insist.

01:28:48.721 --> 01:28:49.587
Come on.

01:29:20.753 --> 01:29:21.654
Hey Nick?

01:29:22.822 --> 01:29:23.621
Yeah buddy.

01:29:23.689 --> 01:29:25.557
Thanks for taking me fishing.

01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:29.095
Anytime little man.

01:29:31.697 --> 01:29:32.564
Anytime.

01:29:39.638 --> 01:29:41.741
What you using as bait?

01:29:42.808 --> 01:29:43.676
Grubs.

01:29:59.539 --> 01:30:04.539
