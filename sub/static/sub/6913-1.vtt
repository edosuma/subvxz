Wait, wait.

Slow down.

01:41.068 --> 01:42.968
-Wait.
-What are you doing?

01:42.970 --> 01:46.638
-I forgot my key.

01:49.742 --> 01:50.876
-This is a nice area.

01:50.878 --> 01:53.879
-Right?

01:53.881 --> 01:55.848

02:05.025 --> 02:08.393
-Impressive.
-Thank you.

02:08.395 --> 02:11.130
-What did you say you did again?

02:11.132 --> 02:13.165
-Insider tradings.

02:13.167 --> 02:14.566
-Just so you know,

02:14.568 --> 02:16.068
I don't do this that much,
like, hardly ever,

02:16.070 --> 02:18.303
so don't be nervous.
-Yeah, yeah.

02:19.906 --> 02:21.306
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.275
-You have a girlfriend
or something?

02:23.277 --> 02:25.344
Because I don't care.
It's totally fine.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.712
-No, no, I would never --
i would never --

02:26.714 --> 02:28.247
-you would never
have a girlfriend?

02:28.249 --> 02:29.915
-No, I would never cheat
on a --

02:29.917 --> 02:31.483
-so, you have a --
do you have a girlfriend?

02:31.485 --> 02:36.021
-No, I don't.
I was just -- I wanted a second.

02:37.858 --> 02:40.259
Why don't we have some wine?

02:40.261 --> 02:42.728
I have wine.
Want some?

02:42.730 --> 02:45.264
-Yeah.
-Okay.

02:55.642 --> 02:58.143
-This is a really nice place.

02:58.145 --> 02:59.611
-Think fast.
-What?

03:00.681 --> 03:04.082
-God.
Where did you get this?

03:04.084 --> 03:06.952
-A wine place.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.921
-This is like an $800 bottle.

03:08.923 --> 03:11.890
-Well, then it better be good.

03:16.796 --> 03:19.798
-Whoa.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.099
Just use an opener.

03:21.101 --> 03:23.235
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

03:23.237 --> 03:26.471
Let's get some glasses.

03:28.241 --> 03:30.342
Hey, hey.

03:30.344 --> 03:34.346
That's some
really expensive wine.

03:34.348 --> 03:37.349
All right. I'm good.

03:42.522 --> 03:44.957
-Oh, yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

03:44.959 --> 03:46.158
-There we go.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.293
Mmm.

03:50.798 --> 03:53.565
-Not used to...

04:09.583 --> 04:11.049
-Shit.

04:14.088 --> 04:17.923
Are you crazy?

04:17.925 --> 04:21.593
What?

04:21.595 --> 04:23.929
-Oh!

04:23.931 --> 04:27.566
Jesus Christ.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.568
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

04:29.570 --> 04:32.137
We don't need
to smash everything.

04:32.139 --> 04:34.606
-I'm so drunk.
-Really?

04:34.608 --> 04:38.810
I feel like you
didn't even drink anything.

04:44.017 --> 04:47.319
-Want to go upstairs?

04:57.864 --> 04:59.598
-You're the hottest girl
that has ever shown

04:59.600 --> 05:01.933
an interest in me before.

05:01.935 --> 05:05.470
Are you latina?

05:05.472 --> 05:08.340
I feel like you're latina.

05:14.247 --> 05:17.015
Shit.

05:59.826 --> 06:02.694
Hello?

06:02.696 --> 06:05.464
Lady?

06:11.804 --> 06:14.139
Crazy.

06:34.427 --> 06:36.928
Okay!

06:38.898 --> 06:44.002
I'm just gonna uber so you
don't have to worry about it!

06:44.004 --> 06:46.705
Thank you?

07:34.555 --> 07:36.955
-Fuck you.

07:45.998 --> 07:47.599
Yeah?
-Hey.

07:47.601 --> 07:50.969
Peter.
How was the flight?

07:50.971 --> 07:52.637
-Short flight.
We didn't crash.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.040
Real success story.
What do you want?

07:55.042 --> 07:56.641
-Good.
And the hotel's good?

07:56.643 --> 07:58.510
Everybody's happy
with the accommodations?

07:58.512 --> 08:00.312
-They're super swank, man.

08:00.314 --> 08:02.247
What's up?

08:02.249 --> 08:05.016
-I'm in will's house.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.586
-I'm sorry?

08:07.588 --> 08:09.554
-I'm standing in will's kitchen.

08:09.556 --> 08:12.023
I'm looking
at will's family portrait.

08:12.025 --> 08:13.358
I don't -- i-i...

08:13.360 --> 08:18.997
-Okay, well, you need to explain
to me why you're there.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.066
-I-i -- after you guys
left the banquet,

08:21.068 --> 08:24.169
I met this girl,
and -- and we had drinks

08:24.171 --> 08:25.937
and -- and it was going
really well.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.539
I think she -- I think she --
i think she liked me.

08:27.541 --> 08:29.341
And then I went back
to her house,

08:29.343 --> 08:32.644
and, um, the only problem is,
it's not her house.

08:32.645 --> 08:35.246
It's, uh...

08:35.249 --> 08:37.549
It's will's house.

08:37.551 --> 08:40.051
-Where is she now?

08:40.053 --> 08:41.318
Kevin.

08:41.321 --> 08:44.155
-You know, at the...

08:44.157 --> 08:47.092
Moment, I don't...

08:47.094 --> 08:49.961
-Kevin, where is she now?
This is very important.

08:49.963 --> 08:53.064
-I have to call you back.
-No. Kevin --

09:08.014 --> 09:10.715
-lady!

09:10.717 --> 09:13.852
Hello? Hello?

09:16.056 --> 09:18.657
Peter. Hello?

09:21.627 --> 09:24.329
Oh, fuck.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.331
Hello-- oh, god.
Hello?

09:26.333 --> 09:29.367
Shit.
Oh, my god.

09:29.369 --> 09:30.635
Oh, shit.

09:30.637 --> 09:33.738
Hey, get up!

09:33.740 --> 09:36.308
Get up!
Okay, get up.

09:36.310 --> 09:37.342
Let's go.
Wake up.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.277
Come on.
Come on.

09:39.279 --> 09:40.745
There you go.
Okay.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.881
Okay.
Now we're talking.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.849
Did you take some--

09:44.851 --> 09:46.284
did you take something?

09:46.286 --> 09:48.620
Did you take something?
Look at me. Hey.

09:48.622 --> 09:50.255
Hey! Wake up!

09:52.292 --> 09:53.625
Hey, Peter.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.026
-You tell me
what's going on right now.

09:55.028 --> 09:57.062
-I'm sorry.
I need to call an ambulance.

09:57.064 --> 09:58.663
-Ow.
-This girl took something.

09:58.665 --> 10:00.498
-What's her name?
-Who cares?

10:00.500 --> 10:01.733
She needs an ambulance.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.835
-Calm down.
What is her name?

10:03.837 --> 10:05.003
-Tell me to calm down, Peter.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.905
Look, I don't know her name!

10:06.907 --> 10:08.640
-Well, what does she look like?

10:08.642 --> 10:10.508
-She's little.
She's got brown hair.

10:10.510 --> 10:13.044
She's -- she's -- she's pretty.
I think she's a latina.

10:13.046 --> 10:16.247
-Is she wearing a red dress?
-She was.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.282
Why?

10:17.284 --> 10:19.150
-Okay, we can't call 911.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.820
-What?
-Is she still breathing?

10:21.822 --> 10:23.088
-How did you know
she was wearing a red dress?

10:23.090 --> 10:25.857
-Is she still fucking breathing,
Kevin?

10:25.859 --> 10:27.592
-Yes, she's still breathing!

10:27.594 --> 10:28.927
-Okay, listen to me.

10:28.929 --> 10:31.262
What I'm about to tell you
stays between us.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.565
-Okay.
-Tell me that you understand

10:33.567 --> 10:35.900
the severity of the situation.

10:35.902 --> 10:38.269
This can't be shared
with anyone.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.671
-Uh-huh. Yeah.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.072
-I'm serious, Kevin.

10:41.074 --> 10:43.341
Nobody else knows about this.
-Of course.

10:43.343 --> 10:46.111
-About a year ago,
this girl seduced will.

10:46.113 --> 10:49.280
Was a huge mistake,
one-time thing.

10:49.282 --> 10:50.782
He cut it off immediately,

10:50.784 --> 10:53.518
but she became obsessed
with him.

10:53.520 --> 10:57.656
Now, if you call 911, the press
is gonna get wind of this.

10:57.658 --> 11:00.659
We can't have that,
not this week.

11:00.661 --> 11:02.360
-What am I supposed to do?
-Sit tight.

11:02.362 --> 11:04.929
I'm gonna send one
of our doctors to you.

11:04.931 --> 11:08.967
In the meantime,
you got to make her throw up.

11:08.969 --> 11:11.803
-P-Peter, I'm n-not really,
um, comfortable with that.

11:11.805 --> 11:14.773
-I don't care what you're
comfortable with, Kevin.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.441
That's what you do.

11:16.443 --> 11:17.809
-Okay.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.310
But don't you think
it'd be a lot simpler

11:19.312 --> 11:20.879
if I just took her
to the hospital, then --

11:20.881 --> 11:22.047
then they could do
what they need to do?

11:22.049 --> 11:24.049
-Dr. Newman can get to you

11:24.051 --> 11:26.184
before you can get
to a hospital.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.085
-The foot guy?!

11:27.087 --> 11:29.554
-Yes. He is a foot specialist.

11:29.556 --> 11:31.623
He is also a real physician.

11:31.625 --> 11:33.625
-O--
-oh, Kevin?

11:33.627 --> 11:35.827
-Fine.
-One more thing.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.295
This is your clusterfuck.

11:37.297 --> 11:41.866
If she doesn't make it,
she was your girlfriend.

11:46.072 --> 11:47.072
-Shit.

11:47.074 --> 11:49.908
Here we go.
Okay.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.609
I want to apologize.

11:51.611 --> 11:56.281
I don't want to do this as much
as you don't want to do this.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.782
Okay, all right.

11:57.784 --> 12:00.218
Uh...

12:04.090 --> 12:06.491
There we go.
There we go.

12:08.294 --> 12:11.296
--Oh!

12:18.037 --> 12:19.504
-Okay, you're doing good.

12:19.506 --> 12:22.774
That's good.
That's good.

12:22.776 --> 12:24.509
That feel better?

12:24.511 --> 12:25.777
There you go.
-I'm all better.

12:25.779 --> 12:28.113
-You're good. Good.
-I'm better.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.849
-Hey, Dr. Newman.
-Kevin, hello.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.317
-It took a little trying.

12:32.319 --> 12:35.286
But I got her to throw up,
so everything's good.

12:35.288 --> 12:36.321
-Oh, yeah.

12:36.323 --> 12:39.591
Yeah, you didn't need
to do that.

12:39.593 --> 12:41.025
-What?

12:41.027 --> 12:42.961
-So, her body's already absorbed
whatever she took,

12:42.963 --> 12:46.431
so that didn't really
help at all.

12:46.433 --> 12:47.699
-Great.

12:47.701 --> 12:48.933
-Okay, so
what are we dealing with here?

12:48.935 --> 12:50.735
Is it sleeping pills,
painkillers?

12:50.737 --> 12:52.837
What do we got?

12:52.839 --> 12:54.873
-I-i have no idea.
-Okay.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.374
Uh, look for an empty bottle.

12:56.376 --> 12:59.577
It's probably somewhere close.

12:59.579 --> 13:00.812
-Empty bottle.

13:00.814 --> 13:02.213
-Just look on the floor,

13:02.215 --> 13:04.149
look behind the toilet,
look in the shower.

13:04.151 --> 13:05.517
Just look for that empty bottle.

13:05.519 --> 13:07.185
--You'll be just fine. Okay.

13:07.187 --> 13:09.788
I'm gonna -- I'm gonna lean you
just like that.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.956
Just stay right there.
-Oh, no.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.458
-Okay, Dr. Newman, I'm looking.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.460
-Kevin, just start breathing.
You need to breathe.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.662
-I'm breathing,
I'm breathing, I'm...

13:17.664 --> 13:19.230
Breathing.
How are you?

13:19.232 --> 13:20.799
-Oh, well, thank you for asking.

13:20.801 --> 13:22.433
Today I went to the circus
with my daughter.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.836
-Oh, that sounds like a --
i got it!

13:24.838 --> 13:27.305
It's Xanax.
-Ah, bingo!

13:27.307 --> 13:28.540
We got a winner.

13:28.542 --> 13:29.808
Okay, what's the dosage?

13:29.810 --> 13:31.843
-.5 milligrams.

13:31.845 --> 13:33.978
-Ugh.
And the bottle's empty?

13:33.980 --> 13:35.847
-Yep. Totally -- totally --
totally empty.

13:35.849 --> 13:37.715
-Okay. Sit tight.

13:37.717 --> 13:39.884
I'll be there in 10 minutes.
-Okay.

13:39.886 --> 13:41.085
-You know what?
Hang on a second.

13:41.087 --> 13:42.187
I'm gonna sing you
a little song.

13:42.189 --> 13:44.322
-Okay.
-It's gonna help. Ready?

13:50.263 --> 13:52.530
-Okay. Okay. I'm --
I'm gonna hang up, doctor.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.933
-Okay, great.

14:05.511 --> 14:08.479
-Hi. Doctor, thank you so much.
I am so -- so sorry about this.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.081
-Lead the way. Lead the way.
-She's -- she's upstairs.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.616
Obviously, you know,
t-this is not how

14:11.618 --> 14:13.418
I thought t-this was gonna
happen, you know.

14:13.420 --> 14:16.487
-God. Did you take something?
-Sorry.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.356
-We were in the bathroom.
I don't know if --

14:18.358 --> 14:20.258
if you're supposed to lean
her up like that, but I did.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.427
-Oh. Okay. All right,
this is what I need you to do.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.796
-She threw up a bunch, and...
-Yeah, yeah.

14:24.798 --> 14:26.297
Okay,
this is what I need you to do.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.099
I need you to go to the kitchen,
make a pot of coffee,

14:28.101 --> 14:31.336
pour a mug 3/4 full, then
you fill the rest with whiskey,

14:31.338 --> 14:34.239
and you need like a teaspoon
of brown sugar in it, all right?

14:34.241 --> 14:36.407
-You want me to make
an Irish coffee?

14:36.409 --> 14:41.446
-Whipped cream would be
fantastic.

14:41.448 --> 14:44.148
Go.

14:45.851 --> 14:47.485
She's got great feet.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.072
Okay. She's doing okay.

15:08.074 --> 15:10.541
She's doing okay.
-Here's your Irish coffee.

15:10.543 --> 15:11.776
-That's for you.

15:11.778 --> 15:13.845
All right, so we're not
out of the woods yet.

15:13.847 --> 15:15.413
Normally I'd attach
a heart monitor,

15:15.415 --> 15:16.915
but since that's not an option,

15:16.917 --> 15:18.516
you're just gonna
have to keep her awake.

15:18.518 --> 15:21.853
-Keep her awake? What happens
if she falls asleep?

15:21.855 --> 15:24.022
-Well, then her brain will stop
sending the signal to her lungs

15:24.024 --> 15:26.090
that she needs to breathe.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.792
But you're not gonna let
that happen, so we don't have to

15:27.794 --> 15:30.895
worry about that, do we?

15:30.897 --> 15:32.897
-W-where are you going?

15:32.899 --> 15:34.299
-I'm going home.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.601
Drink up.

15:38.070 --> 15:41.506
-W-wait, doctor.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.808
-Fuck.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.043
-You're leaving?

15:45.045 --> 15:46.411
-You got to give her
a cold shower,

15:46.413 --> 15:48.846
pour some regular coffee --
-you can't leave.

15:48.848 --> 15:50.615
-Listen, she's gonna
be a little confused at first.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.150
-This is an emergency situation.
-Just ask her name.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.618
I'm pretty sure
it's not mort Stevens.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.620
You know what I'm saying?
Ask her where she is,

15:55.622 --> 15:57.221
who she is, who's the president
of the United States,

15:57.223 --> 15:58.489
all that kind of stuff.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.191
-I could really use
your help here.

16:00.193 --> 16:01.693
-Listen, listen, you just
got to keep her awake all night.

16:01.695 --> 16:02.994
You're gonna be fine, okay?

16:02.996 --> 16:04.529
You got this.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.998
That's a fist bump.
You failed.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.866
All right. Good luck.

16:08.868 --> 16:11.502
-C-come on, we -- b--

16:11.504 --> 16:13.571
fucking foot guy.

16:24.016 --> 16:26.117
-No.
-Yes.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.386
-No, no, no, no, no.
-Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

16:28.388 --> 16:31.155
- No, no, no, no.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.490
-No, no, no, not in the bath,
not in the bath.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.059
That's a drowning place.
That's a drowning place.

16:35.061 --> 16:36.327
Okay. Come on.

16:36.329 --> 16:40.431
There we go. There we go.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.900
There you go.
Good girl.

16:42.902 --> 16:44.469
All right.

16:52.378 --> 16:56.080
-Sit, sit, sit.
Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit.

16:56.082 --> 16:57.982
No, no, no,
don't go out of the shower.

16:57.984 --> 16:59.017
Get in the shower.

16:59.019 --> 17:00.918
Sit.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.520
Sit down.

17:03.322 --> 17:05.623
Oh.

17:13.832 --> 17:16.567
Hey. Head up.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.636
Drink it.

17:18.637 --> 17:20.003
-No.

17:20.006 --> 17:21.239
-Drink the coffee.

17:21.241 --> 17:22.940
-I don't want the coffee.
-Tough shit.

17:22.942 --> 17:26.611
Drink the coffee.

17:26.613 --> 17:30.581
I'm supposed
to ask you some questions.

17:30.583 --> 17:34.585
Probably be good if I knew
your name at this point.

17:37.923 --> 17:39.724
-What's your name?

17:39.726 --> 17:41.359
-I don't remember it.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.327
-You can't remember your name?
You have amnesia?

17:43.329 --> 17:44.796
-Do you know my name?

17:44.798 --> 17:46.531
-No, that's why I just
asked you two seconds ago.

17:46.533 --> 17:50.935
-Well, then you're very
romantic 'cause we just had sex.

17:50.937 --> 17:53.204
-Oh, you remember that?

17:53.206 --> 17:56.274
-Barely. Barely.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.910
-That's funny.
Do you know my name?

17:58.912 --> 18:00.711
-Yep.

18:00.713 --> 18:02.513
Fernando.

18:02.515 --> 18:03.614
-What?

18:03.616 --> 18:06.017
-Fernando.
-Do I look like a Fernando?

18:06.019 --> 18:07.151
-You are so racist.

18:07.153 --> 18:08.386
-How is that racist?

18:08.388 --> 18:10.254
-Because you could be
a Fernando.

18:10.256 --> 18:12.557
-I've never been confused
with a Fernando before.

18:12.559 --> 18:14.058
-You're a racist.
-I'm a racist?

18:14.060 --> 18:16.227
-You're a racist.
-Okay.

18:16.229 --> 18:17.695
Drink your coffee.

18:17.697 --> 18:21.065
-I had sex with a racist.

18:21.067 --> 18:23.634
Add it to the list.

18:36.081 --> 18:38.749
-Madeline Parker.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.952
-That's a good name.

18:40.954 --> 18:42.453
That's a pretty name.

18:42.455 --> 18:45.656
-Well, it is nice to meet you,
i guess.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.125
I'm Kevin.

18:48.862 --> 18:50.461
I know you're confused right now

18:50.463 --> 18:53.831
and that there is a lot of stuff
being thrown at you.

18:53.833 --> 18:59.770
But I would like to know why the
fuck we are in my boss's house.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.572
-Excuse me, Kevin,

19:01.574 --> 19:04.809
but I have no idea
what you're talking about.

19:04.811 --> 19:10.915
And I'm really, really, really
foggy, so...

19:10.917 --> 19:16.988
I don't know how to help you
or whatever you are --

19:16.990 --> 19:18.489
-okay.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.725
Well, when everything clears up
up there for you,

19:20.727 --> 19:22.426
we are gonna have a lot
to talk about.

19:22.428 --> 19:23.728
Hey.

19:23.730 --> 19:27.865
Hey!

19:27.867 --> 19:31.169
I'm sorry that I'm gonna --
get the fuck up.

19:31.171 --> 19:32.370
-Ow!

19:32.372 --> 19:34.539
-God damn it.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.174
You're like a fucking child.

19:36.176 --> 19:37.508
-I am so sleepy.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.976
-Yeah, I know you're sleepy.

19:38.978 --> 19:41.012
That's what happens
when you swallow all that Xanax.

19:41.014 --> 19:44.048
-Two quick minutes
and I promise I won't die.

19:44.050 --> 19:45.616
-You know I can't do that.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.151
-Right.
You want to have sex again?

19:47.153 --> 19:48.186
-What? No.

19:48.188 --> 19:49.687
-I know that look.
-No.

19:49.689 --> 19:52.056
-You're tenacious.
-Not interested.

19:52.058 --> 19:58.029
-You mean you've never,
ever wanted to fuck a starfish?

19:58.031 --> 20:02.099
-This is the least attractive
thing I've seen you do.

20:02.101 --> 20:04.402
Ugh.

20:07.839 --> 20:08.973
Okay.

20:08.975 --> 20:11.242
Let's talk.

20:11.244 --> 20:12.710
You have any pets?

20:12.712 --> 20:15.146
-Wow.
That is a boring intro.

20:15.148 --> 20:16.981
-What? You got a cat?
-I got a dog.

20:16.983 --> 20:18.349
-You have a dog?
-Yeah.

20:18.351 --> 20:20.184
-What's his name?
-How do you know it's a he?

20:20.186 --> 20:22.286
-Okay, what's her name?
-It's a he.

20:22.288 --> 20:24.589
-Okay,
what's your male dog's name?

20:24.591 --> 20:25.823
-Fernando.

20:25.825 --> 20:29.260
- The dog's name is Fernando.

20:29.262 --> 20:31.128
-Where are you from?

20:31.130 --> 20:33.030
-My mom's vagina.
-And where was

20:33.032 --> 20:35.800
your mother's vagina located
when you dropped out of it?

20:35.802 --> 20:37.068
-Shitsville, Ohio.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.971
-Shitsville, Ohio?
Is there a six flags near there?

20:39.973 --> 20:42.540
-Yeah.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.775
I guess.

20:44.777 --> 20:47.478
Where are you from?

20:47.480 --> 20:49.113
-Born and raised here.

20:50.850 --> 20:53.884
-What?

20:53.886 --> 20:54.919
-You're fancy.

20:54.921 --> 20:57.054
-That's fancy?
-Yeah.

20:57.056 --> 20:58.556
-Everyone from Allen has money?

20:58.558 --> 20:59.890
-Yeah.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.525
-You know that stereotype
is bullshit, right?

21:01.527 --> 21:03.461
-Okay, yeah,
you're from the ghetto.

21:03.463 --> 21:04.962
-Not from the ghetto
or the slums.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.597
-You've seen some real shit?
-It's not about that.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.032
I'm just saying --
-yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:08.034 --> 21:13.871
-There's a lot
of economic diversity in Allen.

21:13.873 --> 21:17.942
What do you do?

21:17.944 --> 21:19.010
-Wow!

21:19.012 --> 21:21.178
-What do you do?

21:21.180 --> 21:22.313
-Personal architect.

21:22.315 --> 21:23.347
-You're a personal architect?

21:23.349 --> 21:25.316
-I'm a personal.

21:25.318 --> 21:26.984
-What do you do for a living?

21:26.986 --> 21:28.052
-Body painting.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.186
-You're a body painter?

21:29.188 --> 21:30.321
-I paint bodies.

21:30.323 --> 21:31.422
-What is your job?

21:31.424 --> 21:34.225
-I'm a bartender.

21:34.227 --> 21:36.794
What's wrong with you?

21:36.796 --> 21:41.799
I serve overpriced drinks
to townies like you.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.769
-Just 'cause I live here,
that does not make me a townie.

21:44.771 --> 21:47.305
-Okay.

21:47.307 --> 21:49.407
What do you do?
Wait.

21:49.409 --> 21:52.376
Let me guess.

21:52.378 --> 21:55.379
Aspiring actress.

21:56.214 --> 21:59.016
You're gonna make it good.

22:00.686 --> 22:04.221
-I think you know
who I work for.

22:06.693 --> 22:07.892
Fuck it.

22:07.894 --> 22:09.260
This is too awkward
for me right now.

22:09.262 --> 22:13.397
-This is the most infuriating.

22:16.501 --> 22:19.370
Time to exercise!

22:19.372 --> 22:21.639
-Ow! My lungs! You idiot!

22:21.641 --> 22:23.341
-Here we go.
-That really hurts.

22:23.343 --> 22:26.711
-I'm sorry,
but we got to work out.

22:26.713 --> 22:29.780
Okay, we're just gonna
take a little walk.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.649
All right.
Just walk.

22:31.651 --> 22:33.117
That's all you have to do
is just keep yourself --

22:33.119 --> 22:34.352
-oh, my god.

22:34.354 --> 22:35.886
Is that your toenail?
-I'm sorry.

22:35.888 --> 22:39.190
It's been awhile since I --
-your talons.

22:41.127 --> 22:43.494
-Can you hold on one second?
Just please keep walking.

22:43.496 --> 22:45.730
Hey.
-How's it going there, champ?

22:45.732 --> 22:46.997
-You know, I think,
uh, pretty good.

22:46.999 --> 22:49.633
Everything seems to be
under control.

22:49.635 --> 22:51.268
Shit.
-Whoa.

22:51.270 --> 22:52.870
Oh, no.

22:52.872 --> 22:53.938
-Kevin?

22:53.940 --> 22:55.139
-You are so dumb.
-Kevin, what is that?

22:55.141 --> 22:56.240
-Huh?

22:56.242 --> 22:57.942
What?
Here we go.

22:57.944 --> 23:00.211
-What was that?
-You hurt my rib, you idiot!

23:00.213 --> 23:02.012
- Huh?

23:02.014 --> 23:04.248
-Kevin,
you have to talk to me now.

23:04.250 --> 23:05.750
Talk to me now, son.
-Oh, god.

23:05.752 --> 23:08.052
-What was that?
-Oh, god.

23:08.054 --> 23:12.890
-Oh, nothing, uh, a plate fell
and it's making me cough.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.091
-A plate fell.

23:14.093 --> 23:15.659
A plate fell, he says.

23:15.661 --> 23:19.296
-Okay, please don't wreck
coach's house.

23:19.298 --> 23:20.698
-I won't, Peter.

23:20.700 --> 23:23.100
-Hey, fuck you, Peter!

23:23.102 --> 23:24.902
Go fuck yourself, you dickbag!

23:24.904 --> 23:26.170
-Shut up.

23:26.172 --> 23:27.571
- That's for you.

23:27.573 --> 23:29.440
-We -- we got to keep her
under control, Kevin.

23:29.442 --> 23:30.641
-You're dumb!

23:30.643 --> 23:32.009
-Shut the fuck up.

23:32.011 --> 23:34.011
You are being so rude.

23:34.013 --> 23:35.446
-You're a dickhole!

23:35.448 --> 23:36.580
-What is she saying?

23:36.582 --> 23:38.783
-She says you're a dickhole.

23:38.785 --> 23:42.820
-All right, well, at least
she's feeling better, right?

23:42.822 --> 23:44.989
-Yeah, I think she really
turned a corner.

23:44.991 --> 23:48.125
-All right,
well, keep me posted, okay?

23:48.127 --> 23:50.327
-Have you mentioned anything
to will about this?

23:50.329 --> 23:52.129
-No, I'm gonna do that
right now.

23:52.131 --> 23:55.466
-If you could maybe just, um,
reiterate to him when you do

23:55.468 --> 23:57.935
how much I respect him and --
and -- and I would never want

23:57.937 --> 24:00.070
to get involved
in his personal life, of course.

24:00.072 --> 24:03.073
-Look, take it easy.

24:03.075 --> 24:04.742
You're gonna be fine.

24:04.744 --> 24:08.245
Right now, we just
have to keep a lid on this.

24:08.247 --> 24:11.882
Don't let her talk to anyone
and don't let her leave.

24:11.884 --> 24:13.684
-That might be a bit
of a challenge.

24:13.686 --> 24:16.020
-I know you never had sex,
Peter.

24:17.223 --> 24:19.623
I know you're a virgin, Peter!

24:19.625 --> 24:21.859
-Okay, buddy, look,

24:21.861 --> 24:23.694
you're really saving will's ass
on this.

24:23.696 --> 24:25.396
We're not gonna
forget about you.

24:25.398 --> 24:28.299
I'm gonna be on the first plane
out of l.A.X. In the morning.

24:28.301 --> 24:31.402
I should be down there
at 7:00 A.M. to relieve you.

24:31.404 --> 24:32.503
-Okay.

24:32.505 --> 24:35.706
I won't let anybody down.

24:41.012 --> 24:42.446
-What?

24:42.448 --> 24:45.015
-So you know Peter?

24:45.017 --> 24:47.084
-I know <i> a</i> Peter.
-Can we have just,

24:47.086 --> 24:49.286
like, a normal conversation
for two seconds?

24:49.288 --> 24:51.522
I know about you and will.

24:54.259 --> 24:57.261
-I need a fucking cigarette.

24:59.631 --> 25:00.831
-You shouldn't smoke.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.900
It's bad for your health.

25:02.902 --> 25:05.936
-Thank you.

25:08.540 --> 25:10.407
What'd he tell you?

25:10.409 --> 25:11.675
-You know, everything.

25:11.677 --> 25:14.144
That you guys
had a one-night stand

25:14.146 --> 25:17.448
and that you got all crazy
and obsessive.

25:17.450 --> 25:18.983
So typical.

25:18.985 --> 25:23.988
You think he would really
leave his wife and kids for...

25:23.990 --> 25:25.723
-For what?

25:25.725 --> 25:28.559
For what?
I'm interested.

25:28.561 --> 25:30.261
I'm genuinely interested
in what you have to say.

25:30.263 --> 25:31.428
-Nothing.
-For what?

25:31.430 --> 25:32.530
-Nothing.
-For what?

25:32.532 --> 25:33.797
Some crazy slut you take home

25:33.799 --> 25:36.133
for a cheap fuck?
-That's not what I meant.

25:36.135 --> 25:38.102
-Isn't that
what happened tonight?

25:38.104 --> 25:41.238
Isn't that what happened?

25:41.240 --> 25:44.408
-Tonight you...

25:44.410 --> 25:46.877
You took me home.

25:51.149 --> 25:53.183
-And with that, I'm leaving.
-Where you going? Come on.

25:53.185 --> 25:54.485
No, come on.

25:54.487 --> 25:57.254
Let's just relax for a second
and talk.

25:57.256 --> 26:00.824
-Relax?!

26:00.826 --> 26:02.059
-I'm sorry,
but I can't let you leave.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.928
-Where is my dress?
-I don't know.

26:03.930 --> 26:06.330
We took it off in,
like, a big rush.

26:06.332 --> 26:07.565
-Turn around.

26:07.567 --> 26:08.999
Turn around, you perv!
God!

26:09.001 --> 26:11.168
-Okay, I saw it all anyway
like an hour ago.

26:11.170 --> 26:12.403
-Yeah, and then I tried
to kill myself.

26:12.405 --> 26:13.971
You do the math.

26:13.973 --> 26:16.073
-That's not why you tried
to kill yourself. Come on.

26:16.075 --> 26:19.243
-Oh, you know why?
You know why?

26:19.245 --> 26:21.579
-I've never gotten, you know,
that bad of a response.

26:21.581 --> 26:24.148
-Shut up.
Shut up. Shut your mouth.

26:24.150 --> 26:27.084
Zipper.
-I don't think that you should

26:27.086 --> 26:28.852
drive a car really.
-Zipper!

26:28.854 --> 26:30.754
-You took enough drugs
to take down an elephant.

26:30.756 --> 26:33.390
-I appreciate the comparison.
-I'm just saying,

26:33.392 --> 26:35.192
you think you should be
operating heavy machinery?

26:35.194 --> 26:36.427
-It's a dodge neon.

26:36.429 --> 26:38.162
It doesn't exactly qualify
as heavy machinery.

26:38.164 --> 26:40.064
-Anything that's got four wheels
and a motor like that,

26:40.066 --> 26:41.632
that's heavy machinery.
-You know what?

26:41.634 --> 26:44.268
Could you just -- fuck!

26:48.507 --> 26:50.074
I am fine.
-I didn't say --

26:50.076 --> 26:51.642
-i am fine. I am fine.
-I didn't say anything.

26:51.644 --> 26:54.144
You try hopping around
on one heel.

26:54.146 --> 26:56.513
-I just -- i-i don't think
that that's why you fell.

26:56.515 --> 26:59.083
-"I-i-i-i-i-i."

26:59.085 --> 27:00.217
Stupid idiot.

27:00.219 --> 27:03.053
-I don't -- I don't know --
-where's my bra?

27:03.055 --> 27:05.756
Where is my bra?

27:11.196 --> 27:13.364
-I'm serious.

27:13.366 --> 27:14.965
I can't let you leave.

27:14.967 --> 27:18.535
-Shut up.

27:18.537 --> 27:20.671
It's been real, kev.

27:20.673 --> 27:23.674
-You're not going anywhere.

27:23.676 --> 27:25.809
-High-five?
-I'm serious.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.011
-And I'm leaving.

27:27.013 --> 27:30.714
Get the -- you are such a pussy.

27:36.321 --> 27:38.856
-Hold on.

27:43.328 --> 27:47.364
I won't let you.

27:47.366 --> 27:49.967
-Kevin.

27:49.969 --> 27:53.470
Please don't get obsessed.

27:53.472 --> 27:55.673
It's just a one-night stand.

27:58.276 --> 28:00.444
You know --

28:00.446 --> 28:02.379
-damn it, Kevin,
what's so bad if she licks you?

28:02.381 --> 28:03.714
Hey!

28:03.716 --> 28:05.683
I will call the cops.
Do you hear me?

28:05.685 --> 28:07.084
-Do whatever
you got to do, dude.

28:07.086 --> 28:09.386
-I am serious. Don't get
in the car. Please.

28:09.388 --> 28:11.422
I'm begging you.
I was told to keep you here.

28:11.424 --> 28:15.626
Really, i-i-I'm running out
of options here. Please.

28:15.628 --> 28:17.761
Please, I am begging you, do not
put those keys in the ignition.

28:17.763 --> 28:19.329
Please do not put those keys
in the ignition.

28:19.331 --> 28:20.998
Don't start the car.
Don't start the car!

28:21.000 --> 28:22.232
Please!
Don't put it in reverse!

28:22.234 --> 28:23.701
I am begging you!
Do not back

28:23.703 --> 28:25.936
out of this driveway!
-Dude, let go!

28:25.938 --> 28:27.371
-Please.
I can help you.

28:27.373 --> 28:28.605
-Let go!
-I'm serious.

28:28.607 --> 28:29.840
Please just get out of the car.

28:29.842 --> 28:30.908
-You asked for it.

28:30.910 --> 28:32.342
-Please, I am begging you.

28:32.344 --> 28:34.244
Everything that --

28:34.246 --> 28:35.713
oh!

28:35.715 --> 28:37.681
-You asked for it!

28:37.683 --> 28:39.683
-Oh!

28:39.685 --> 28:43.353
Oh, my god! My eyes!

28:43.355 --> 28:45.889
-God damn it.

28:45.891 --> 28:48.492
-I've been nothing
but nice to you!

28:48.494 --> 28:51.762
This entire time!

28:51.764 --> 28:54.298
-I said to let go.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.900
-Oh! Ah!

28:56.902 --> 28:59.603
-Just get up.
-Oh, god!

28:59.605 --> 29:00.604
-Just...

29:00.606 --> 29:01.905
-It feels bad.

29:01.907 --> 29:04.575
It feels like it's really bad.
-Come on.

29:04.577 --> 29:06.777
I got to go, so let's just --
-it burns so bad.

29:06.779 --> 29:08.245
-Okay, you got to stop hunching.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.647
-I don't want to get hit
in the midsection with a corner.

29:10.649 --> 29:13.784
-It was -- okay.

29:13.786 --> 29:16.520
All right. Just hold on.
Oh, my god.

29:16.522 --> 29:19.723
-Oh, god.

29:19.725 --> 29:21.425
Oh, man, it burns so bad.

29:21.427 --> 29:23.393
-Well...

29:23.395 --> 29:25.395
-I'm gonna have to wear
two eye patches to work.

29:25.397 --> 29:27.731
-Nobody wears two eye patches.
Don't do that.

29:27.733 --> 29:29.833
-I think I caught my corneas
on the blades of grass.

29:29.835 --> 29:31.835
-Well, then why'd you
rub your eyes in it?

29:31.837 --> 29:33.270
-To get the burning --

29:33.272 --> 29:34.438
I can't open --

29:34.440 --> 29:35.973
-did -- did it work?
-I can't open my eyes.

29:35.975 --> 29:38.175
It burns my -- it burns my eyes.
-Oh, no.

29:38.177 --> 29:40.911
Oh, no. Let's do this.
-Does it look bad?

29:40.913 --> 29:44.615
--Does it look really bad?

29:44.617 --> 29:45.816
Does it look bad?

29:45.818 --> 29:47.985
Because I have to --
-it --

29:47.987 --> 29:50.487
-does it look crazy?

29:50.489 --> 29:53.157
-Yes.

29:53.159 --> 29:55.125
It doesn't look that bad.
It's okay.

29:55.127 --> 29:58.262
What?

29:58.264 --> 30:01.532
No, no, no. No.

30:01.534 --> 30:02.766
Hey!
-Hey, what?

30:02.768 --> 30:05.169
-Hey!
-Ah!

30:07.206 --> 30:09.807
Ah! Stop it.
-Give me the keys.

30:09.809 --> 30:11.308
Give me the keys.
Give me the keys.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.877
-Ow! Oh!
-Stepped on your foot.

30:13.879 --> 30:18.549
-I'm gonna put you in the sink
and wash you like a little baby.

30:18.551 --> 30:22.386
Get ready.

30:22.388 --> 30:25.756
-Ahh!
Are you fucking kidding me?!

30:36.267 --> 30:39.002
Fuck!

30:40.972 --> 30:44.208
You asshole!

30:44.210 --> 30:45.542
-Where you driving?
Wait.

30:45.544 --> 30:48.612
Easy.

30:48.614 --> 30:50.280
Ow!

30:50.282 --> 30:52.149
Oh!

30:52.151 --> 30:54.952
I wouldn't go in there.
-Fuck!

30:54.954 --> 30:57.120
-There's, like,
poison oak, coyotes,

30:57.122 --> 31:00.524
I heard there's a mountain lion,
like ticks and stuff.

31:00.526 --> 31:03.994
Oh!

31:03.996 --> 31:07.297
You want to --
you want to play scrabble?

31:09.334 --> 31:11.935
-Nerd.

31:14.739 --> 31:17.608
I don't care. I don't care.

31:27.119 --> 31:30.020
-Hey. Hey, what are you doing?

31:30.022 --> 31:33.056
Hey. Are you crazy?
Are you insane?

31:33.058 --> 31:36.159
-I'm not driving,
so why the fuck not?

31:36.161 --> 31:38.295
Okay, okay, no, no, no, no.
You won't let me drink.

31:38.297 --> 31:40.430
You won't let me drive.
You won't let me sleep.

31:40.432 --> 31:42.799
You're getting a little
too controlling, kev.

31:42.801 --> 31:44.434
I don't like that in a guy,
okay?

31:44.436 --> 31:46.637
-I just don't think
you should be drinking whiskey

31:46.639 --> 31:47.971
after downing all those pills.

31:47.973 --> 31:49.439
-And I just don't think
i want to spend

31:49.441 --> 31:50.540
another second with you.

31:50.542 --> 31:51.975
-Well, I'm sorry about that,
but --

31:51.977 --> 31:53.143
-is this Peter?
-What?

31:53.145 --> 31:54.811
-This is Peter. This is Peter.

31:54.813 --> 31:56.546
-What are you talking about?
-Peter put you up to this.

31:56.548 --> 31:58.148
-That's crazy.
-Peter wanted you to babysit me,

31:58.150 --> 31:59.917
keep me here
so I don't do anything crazy.

31:59.919 --> 32:00.918
-I think you're
a little bit --

32:00.920 --> 32:02.486
- aah!

32:02.488 --> 32:04.021
I don't think
that you should be --

32:04.023 --> 32:05.222
-god, that guy is so good!

32:05.224 --> 32:06.623
He manipulated a little baby boy

32:06.625 --> 32:08.692
like you to take care
of the crazy Madeline!

32:08.694 --> 32:11.762
Volatile Madeline!
-Just don't want you to die.

32:11.764 --> 32:13.163
-Oh, you care about me now?

32:13.165 --> 32:14.831
-It's not caring or not.
-You care about me now?

32:14.833 --> 32:16.066
You have no ulterior motive

32:16.068 --> 32:17.334
to keep me here?
Get out of my way.

32:17.336 --> 32:18.735
-What ulterior motive
would I have?

32:18.737 --> 32:19.903
Why do you keep hitting me?!

32:19.905 --> 32:21.505
-You know
what I'm talking about.

32:21.507 --> 32:23.240
-No, I don't!
-I could do a lot of damage

32:23.242 --> 32:24.708
to will if I wanted to.

32:24.710 --> 32:26.243
-Oh, you could do damage?

32:26.245 --> 32:28.111
-Yes, I could.
-Who's gonna listen to you?

32:28.113 --> 32:29.646
-Um, for your information,
i have a friend

32:29.648 --> 32:31.982
at the <i> herald</i> who would be happy
to take my call.

32:31.984 --> 32:34.217
Do not laugh at me.

32:34.219 --> 32:37.688
-I want you to know that will
is beloved at the <i> herald.</i>

32:37.690 --> 32:39.589
-Oh, you are so condescending.
-And if there was ever

32:39.591 --> 32:41.325
a question of your word
versus his...

32:41.327 --> 32:43.527
-Oh, you are so condescending.
-...I would be shocked

32:43.529 --> 32:47.230
if anyone would even entertain
your side of the story.

32:47.232 --> 32:49.399
What is that?
-That's his dick.

32:49.401 --> 32:50.467
-Oh, man.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.536
Oh!

32:52.538 --> 32:54.271
There's no way
to prove that that's will.

32:54.273 --> 32:58.308
That could be anybody.
-Are you kidding?

32:58.310 --> 33:01.178
-Okay, yeah, in full body
it's will, but --

33:01.180 --> 33:02.846
oh, man, is he flexing?

33:02.848 --> 33:04.614
-He's so buff.

33:04.616 --> 33:06.116
This was around Christmas.

33:06.118 --> 33:08.251
-Oh, god, I'm never gonna
be able to unsee that.

33:08.253 --> 33:11.655
-He is gonna look so good
on sportscenter.

33:11.657 --> 33:14.257
Hey! Hey! Oh!

33:14.259 --> 33:16.560
Doesn't matter. They're
all saved to cloud, bitch.

33:16.562 --> 33:19.296
Idiot. That is the last time you
grab something out of my hand!

33:19.298 --> 33:21.031
-What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna destroy a man's

33:21.033 --> 33:23.066
life before the biggest game
of his career?

33:23.068 --> 33:24.468
-I'm sorry.

33:24.470 --> 33:25.936
What?

33:25.938 --> 33:27.337
I know he's your boss
and everything

33:27.339 --> 33:29.773
and you think
he's like super-cool, the man,

33:29.775 --> 33:30.941
but he did this to himself.

33:30.943 --> 33:32.442
-He is more than just my boss.

33:32.444 --> 33:35.045
I have bled silver and blue
since I was a little kid,

33:35.047 --> 33:37.014
and do you have any idea
what it would mean

33:37.016 --> 33:40.584
to bring a national championship
to this school, to this town?

33:40.586 --> 33:42.652
-He completely fucks over
his whole family

33:42.654 --> 33:44.955
and the only thing you can think
about is this stupid game?

33:44.957 --> 33:46.656
-This is will's personal life.

33:46.658 --> 33:49.059
You picked a pretty convenient
time to air some dirty laundry.

33:49.061 --> 33:50.927
-No, no, no.
I didn't have some grand scheme.

33:50.929 --> 33:53.430
I was walking into the ocean
with a pocketful of rocks

33:53.432 --> 33:55.198
and then your dumb ass
came along,

33:55.200 --> 33:56.900
so if you're gonna make me live
this shitty life,

33:56.902 --> 33:58.168
then he's gonna do it, too!

33:58.170 --> 33:59.703
-That's a nice way
to live your life.

33:59.705 --> 34:02.039
I hope the universe gives back
what you put into it.

34:02.041 --> 34:03.673
-I didn't plan this.
I didn't want this.

34:03.675 --> 34:05.609
-Mm-hmm.
-All I wanted to do was to go

34:05.611 --> 34:08.011
to the banquet and talk to will.
-Yeah.

34:08.013 --> 34:11.181
-But Peter intercepted me
and he wouldn't let me do that.

34:11.183 --> 34:14.551
-What would you have
said to him?

34:14.553 --> 34:16.820
Hmm?

34:16.822 --> 34:18.955
I mean, so what?

34:18.956 --> 34:20.524
You banged once.

34:20.525 --> 34:22.059
He sent you a couple dick pics.

34:22.061 --> 34:25.529
That's what middle-aged guys do.

34:28.132 --> 34:31.068
-Wasn't only once.

34:31.070 --> 34:32.502
I know you think I'm this floozy

34:32.504 --> 34:34.571
that he just took home
for a one-night stand,

34:34.572 --> 34:37.607
but you could not be further
from the truth.

34:37.609 --> 34:42.079
-I don't think you're a floozy,
mostly because it's not 1923.

34:42.081 --> 34:43.447
-Oh, god.

34:43.449 --> 34:47.117
-And I know that I have no right
to know this.

34:47.119 --> 34:48.485
I don't even know
why I'm asking.

34:48.487 --> 34:50.320
But...

34:50.322 --> 34:53.190
How long did it go on?

34:56.328 --> 34:59.596
Three -- three -- three weeks?

34:59.598 --> 35:01.731
-No.

35:01.733 --> 35:03.366
-Three months?

35:03.368 --> 35:05.068
-No.

35:05.070 --> 35:07.170
-God. Three years?

35:07.172 --> 35:09.139
Such a long time.

35:09.141 --> 35:11.341
-Yes, it is.

35:11.343 --> 35:12.676
-But he ended it, I guess.

35:12.678 --> 35:15.946
There's -- he knew
that what he had done,

35:15.948 --> 35:17.114
it was wrong.

35:17.116 --> 35:19.883
-Yeah, he ended it
by text message.

35:19.885 --> 35:21.184
-Oh, my god.

35:22.321 --> 35:24.554
It was a classy, classy move.

35:24.556 --> 35:28.291
-I'm sorry.
I've gotten one of those once.

35:28.293 --> 35:30.360
It's no fun.

35:30.362 --> 35:31.962
-What'd it say?

35:31.964 --> 35:34.764
-It said, "Kevin, I think
we should see other people.

35:34.766 --> 35:36.032
Frownie face."

35:36.034 --> 35:38.902
-Oh.

35:38.904 --> 35:41.104
That sucks.

35:41.106 --> 35:43.773
-Such a fucking idiot.

35:46.978 --> 35:50.380
I mean, the man preaches
integrity and accountability.

35:50.382 --> 35:54.518
And what? He's just --
he's just a fucking horndog.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.319
-Well, that's not fair.

35:56.321 --> 35:58.321
That's not accurate.

35:58.323 --> 36:00.557
We had more than just sex.

36:00.559 --> 36:03.160
-It was more than just sex?
-Yeah.

36:03.162 --> 36:05.662
-Well, that makes me feel
a lot better.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.130
49-year-old man,

36:07.132 --> 36:10.800
girl who looks like you -- sure
you got the world to talk about.

36:10.802 --> 36:14.838
-Wow, you are exactly
like everyone in this town!

36:14.840 --> 36:17.474
Everyone has the same attitude
about will.

36:17.476 --> 36:20.510
Will Campbell, coach.
That's it.

36:20.512 --> 36:23.914
-He's more than coach Campbell
to me. He's my mentor.

36:23.916 --> 36:25.949
-He's your mentor?

36:25.951 --> 36:27.751
I don't want to make you sad,

36:27.753 --> 36:30.887
but he's your mentor and you've
never even been in his house.

36:30.889 --> 36:33.623
You didn't even know
this was his house.

36:33.625 --> 36:35.525
He didn't invite you
to any of his cookouts?

36:35.527 --> 36:38.161
-I am one of three
video assistants, okay?

36:38.163 --> 36:41.031
It takes a lot to cultivate
that kind of relationship.

36:41.033 --> 36:43.466
But I know I do a good job
and I know that he has noticed,

36:43.468 --> 36:45.368
and we have talked
multiple times.

36:45.370 --> 36:47.037
-Buddy, buddy, buddy,
okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.

36:47.039 --> 36:50.106
Wait, wait, wait, hey.

36:50.108 --> 36:52.475
I completely get it.

36:52.477 --> 36:55.879
I know exactly the job
he does on people.

36:55.881 --> 36:58.381
Let me guess.
He looked you in the eye.

36:58.383 --> 37:02.552
He remembered your name,
little, like, details about you,

37:02.554 --> 37:08.592
he shook your hand.
He made you feel special, right?

37:08.594 --> 37:13.196
It is sick,
but he is so good at that.

37:13.198 --> 37:17.267
-Well, if he's so full of shit,
how come you liked him?

37:17.269 --> 37:19.202
-Because he didn't do that
to me.

37:19.204 --> 37:20.537
-Okay.
-He didn't.

37:20.539 --> 37:22.439
He never wore that mask
around me.

37:22.441 --> 37:24.441
-I'm sure you saw
the real will Campbell.

37:24.443 --> 37:25.809
-Actually, yes, I did.

37:25.811 --> 37:27.644
-You know he's been
married for 20 years.

37:27.646 --> 37:29.813
-And they've been on auto pilot
for at least half of that.

37:29.815 --> 37:32.582
-If Sarah knew, this whole thing
would be just...

37:32.584 --> 37:35.285
-She hasn't been
complaining so far.

37:35.287 --> 37:36.953
-Sarah knows?

37:36.955 --> 37:38.855
-With will's last contract
extension,

37:38.857 --> 37:43.126
it pays to turn a blind eye,
doesn't it?

37:43.128 --> 37:47.397
-My chest feels really tight.

37:47.399 --> 37:51.901
I think I'm having
a heart attack.

37:51.903 --> 37:53.236
-No, it's your left arm.

37:53.238 --> 37:55.005
-Yeah, yeah,
that's the one that hurts.

37:55.007 --> 37:57.040
-All right, you want a drink?

37:57.042 --> 37:58.308
-I've had too much to drink.

37:58.310 --> 37:59.576
-Because I could really
use a drink.

37:59.578 --> 38:00.810
-I think I need
like a baby aspirin.

38:00.812 --> 38:02.012
They say that --
-we're having drinks.

38:02.014 --> 38:04.514
I'm gonna get us some.

38:16.827 --> 38:19.062
-Good god.

38:19.064 --> 38:21.131
Will's wine is spectacular.

38:21.133 --> 38:24.100
-Mm-hmm.

38:24.102 --> 38:26.102
-You okay?

38:26.104 --> 38:31.308
You're not supposed
to be drinking that much.

38:31.310 --> 38:33.576
-Let's smoke weed.
-No.

38:33.578 --> 38:35.745
-You want to smoke weed?
-No!

38:35.747 --> 38:36.946
-Yeah.

38:36.948 --> 38:39.716
-No!

38:39.718 --> 38:41.318
Can we please get out of here?

38:41.320 --> 38:44.521
-She's 16. She's got weed.
That's a law.

38:44.523 --> 38:46.823
-This is creeping me out.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.992
- Ooh.

38:48.994 --> 38:52.095
-Ooh, what?

38:52.097 --> 38:53.196
-It's a little guitar.

38:53.198 --> 38:54.364
-I think it's a violin.

38:54.366 --> 38:57.467
-I know it's a violin.
My god.

38:57.469 --> 38:59.135
-Please don't.
What are you gonna do with that?

38:59.137 --> 39:04.974
-I'm gonna roll it up and I'm
gonna smoke it like a doobie.

39:12.083 --> 39:14.617
You want to see something cool?

39:17.522 --> 39:19.289
-Super weird.

39:19.291 --> 39:21.057
-Oh, my god.
Sorry.

39:21.059 --> 39:22.826
-Can we get out of this room
now, please?

39:22.828 --> 39:24.260
-Ooh, darts!

39:24.262 --> 39:26.663
-You know, for someone who took
a whole shit-ton of Xanax,

39:26.665 --> 39:28.064
you're bouncing off the walls.

39:28.066 --> 39:30.300
-You see this?
That's some harsh shit.

39:30.302 --> 39:32.035
What do you think
that bitch did?

39:32.037 --> 39:33.503
-Who cares?
Let's go.

39:33.505 --> 39:35.105
-What do you mean, who cares?
-I mean who cares.

39:35.107 --> 39:36.439
Stop -- ow!

39:36.441 --> 39:39.776
Who hands darts
with the needles -- ow!

39:39.778 --> 39:42.412
Fuck! Shit!

39:42.414 --> 39:44.414
-You're out of
your fucking mind!

39:44.416 --> 39:47.884
- I'm just a little tired.

39:50.589 --> 39:52.288
-Come on. Let's get
out of this room, please.

39:52.290 --> 39:54.057
-No, let's play.
-I don't want to play.

39:54.059 --> 39:56.726
-Why?
You afraid I'm gonna beat you?

39:56.728 --> 39:58.561
-Okay, we'll play one game.
-Oh, okay.

39:58.563 --> 40:00.597
-This sock will be the line.

40:00.599 --> 40:02.966
I'm gonna play
standard scoring rules, okay?

40:02.968 --> 40:04.434
-Oh, my god.
-We'll just go by the bars.

40:04.436 --> 40:05.535
-Why are you so serious
all of a sudden?

40:05.537 --> 40:06.836
Why can't we just play

40:06.838 --> 40:08.204
whoever hits
the bull's-eye first wins?

40:08.206 --> 40:10.273
-Because we'll be here all night
if we do that.

40:10.275 --> 40:11.908
-You'll be here all night.

40:11.910 --> 40:14.711
I won't.

40:14.713 --> 40:16.780
-Dang.
Good shot.

40:16.782 --> 40:20.316
-Thanks.

40:20.318 --> 40:21.985
Shit!

40:21.987 --> 40:24.220
T-t-t-the board is clearly
not flush to the wall,

40:24.222 --> 40:26.289
making it very difficult
to catch a good angle.

40:26.291 --> 40:27.657
-Okay, it's not regulation?

40:27.659 --> 40:28.691
-It's not.
It's bullshit.

40:28.693 --> 40:30.527
-Okay.
-It's not fair.

40:30.529 --> 40:34.030
-Is this why the whole team
left you behind?

40:34.032 --> 40:37.767
-What's that supposed to mean?
-I mean, they're all in L.A.

40:37.769 --> 40:39.369
The big game is four days away

40:39.371 --> 40:42.138
and you're here playing darts
with me.

40:42.140 --> 40:44.207
-I don't have to physically
be with the team

40:44.209 --> 40:45.975
to show my worth or contribute.

40:45.977 --> 40:48.445
Thank you, though.

40:48.447 --> 40:51.181
-What do you do then?

40:51.183 --> 40:53.583
-I go through hours of high
school players' video footage

40:53.585 --> 40:55.285
and then I take notes --
-you jerk off on it?

40:55.287 --> 40:58.621
-And I give the notes about the
exceptional players to Peter.

40:58.623 --> 41:00.957
-Hmm.
-Fuck!

41:00.959 --> 41:02.158
Man!

41:02.160 --> 41:05.528
I've never -- I've never shot
this poorly.

41:05.530 --> 41:07.797
-Boom! She's gonna feel that
in the morning,

41:07.799 --> 41:09.499
that Chelsea.
-Who's Chelsea?

41:09.501 --> 41:11.935
-I named her Chelsea because
there's this really mean cunt

41:11.937 --> 41:14.037
that I went to high school with,
and she looks just like her.

41:14.039 --> 41:17.106
-I never had any drama
in high school.

41:17.108 --> 41:18.775
-You mean you never got laid
in high school?

41:18.777 --> 41:21.377
-I mean I was a heavier --
i was --

41:21.379 --> 41:23.513
I weighed a lot more, so...

41:23.515 --> 41:26.516
-How heavy can you get?

41:26.518 --> 41:29.252
-Are you done?

41:29.254 --> 41:31.521
-Can -- can I -- yeah, I'm done.

41:31.523 --> 41:34.524
-Just take a shot.

41:34.526 --> 41:36.125
Aah! Aah!
-That's bullshit.

41:36.127 --> 41:37.360
You were over the line.

41:37.362 --> 41:38.695
I'm sorry.
You're way over.

41:38.697 --> 41:40.263
-No, I wasn't.
-Look where your feet are.

41:40.265 --> 41:41.898
-I was going by that one.
-Why would you go that by sock?

41:41.900 --> 41:43.800
That sock's three feet closer,
and we were --

41:43.802 --> 41:46.169
-you said the sock.
You said stand behind the sock.

41:46.171 --> 41:48.671
You didn't specify which -- hey!

41:48.673 --> 41:51.407
You just can't handle
that I beat you.

41:51.409 --> 41:52.542
-I can handle that you beat me

41:52.544 --> 41:54.043
if you can handle
that you cheated.

41:54.045 --> 41:55.578
-I -- okay, fine.

41:55.580 --> 41:56.779
Whatever helps you sleep
at night, but I won.

41:56.781 --> 41:57.947
-I'll sleep fine at night

41:57.949 --> 41:59.949
knowing that I won
fair and square,

41:59.951 --> 42:01.451
because that's how we do it
at Allen state.

42:01.453 --> 42:02.952
-Oh, my god.

42:02.954 --> 42:05.788
Don't tell me
you actually believe

42:05.790 --> 42:07.390
in all of will's bullshit.

42:07.392 --> 42:08.858
-Yeah, I actually do.

42:08.860 --> 42:11.094
I wouldn't have
gone into coaching if I didn't.

42:11.096 --> 42:12.862
-That's how you got
into coaching?

42:12.864 --> 42:14.130
I thought it was
because you couldn't play.

42:14.132 --> 42:17.133
-I could have played.
-What? Kicker?

42:17.135 --> 42:18.801
I don't think
they let fatties kick the ball.

42:18.803 --> 42:20.169
-Are you just gonna give
me shit all night,

42:20.171 --> 42:21.704
or do you want
me to answer your question?

42:21.706 --> 42:23.907
-Can we do both?

42:23.909 --> 42:26.142
All right.
Answer my question.

42:26.144 --> 42:27.443
-Well, if you must know,

42:27.445 --> 42:29.379
I was actually in the stadium
during the mud bowl.

42:29.381 --> 42:31.180
-I don't know what that is,
but it sounds gross.

42:31.182 --> 42:32.382
-You don't know
what the mud bowl is?

42:32.384 --> 42:33.616
-No, I don't like football.

42:33.618 --> 42:34.918
I told you.
I think it's barbaric.

42:34.920 --> 42:36.352
-What do you and will
talk about?

42:36.354 --> 42:38.588
-History, politics.

42:38.590 --> 42:39.822
We covered a lot.

42:39.824 --> 42:41.491
-And you never went over
the mud bowl?

42:41.493 --> 42:44.827
-No. God.
Mud bowl, mud bowl, mud bowl.

42:44.829 --> 42:46.663
You obviously want to tell me
about the mud bowl.

42:46.665 --> 42:49.866
-No, I don't want to tell you
if you're gonna be like that.

42:49.868 --> 42:52.735
-Will you please tell me
about the mud bowl?

42:52.737 --> 42:54.771
-It was awesome.

42:54.773 --> 42:57.307
I was 14 years old.

42:57.309 --> 43:00.009
My dad took me to the game.
My first time in the stadium.

43:00.011 --> 43:01.811
It's will's first year
as the head coach,

43:01.813 --> 43:03.079
and it is pouring rain.

43:03.081 --> 43:04.814
And at this time,
we're like a cupcake game

43:04.816 --> 43:06.316
on major program schedules.

43:06.318 --> 43:08.217
You know what I mean?
Just so they can get a "w,"

43:08.219 --> 43:09.485
keep they're ranking high.

43:09.487 --> 43:12.589
Notre dame comes in ranked
number one in the nation.

43:12.591 --> 43:15.892
We go toe-to-toe with them
the entire game.

43:15.894 --> 43:18.761
Fourth quarter, we're down
by a touchdown, a minute left.

43:18.763 --> 43:20.430
We're on our own 4 yard line.

43:20.432 --> 43:21.764
We have to drive
the entire field.

43:21.766 --> 43:23.366
We have no time-outs.

43:23.368 --> 43:25.234
How do we do it?
Methodically.

43:25.236 --> 43:26.936
They're in a dime package,
and will knows that.

43:26.938 --> 43:28.605
There's no need
to try to go over the top.

43:28.607 --> 43:32.442
So everything's a quick drop,
short outs, crossing patterns.

43:32.444 --> 43:33.977
If you catch the ball
within the hash marks,

43:33.979 --> 43:35.511
you got to get out of bounds
right away.

43:35.513 --> 43:36.946
We score.

43:36.948 --> 43:39.282
A normal coach --
just kick the extra point,

43:39.284 --> 43:40.650
we'll deal with it in overtime,
right?

43:40.652 --> 43:42.018
We have the momentum.
Not will.

43:42.020 --> 43:44.721
Will calls an end-around
to Marcus Freeman,

43:44.723 --> 43:46.623
who everybody knows
is gonna get the ball

43:46.625 --> 43:47.991
and try to run it
to the end zone.

43:47.993 --> 43:50.593
They've got 10 in the box
stacked against him.

43:50.595 --> 43:51.828
What does Marcus do?

43:51.830 --> 43:53.396
He throws across his body

43:53.398 --> 43:56.933
to a wide-open receiver
in the corner of the end zone.

43:56.935 --> 43:58.735
Two-point conversion good.

43:58.737 --> 44:04.374
The greatest football call in
the history of football calls.

44:04.376 --> 44:05.541
-Wow.

44:05.543 --> 44:07.677
-Yeah.

44:07.679 --> 44:09.946
-So, did they win?
-Yeah, we won!

44:09.948 --> 44:11.948
That was the game
that put Allen state on the map.

44:11.950 --> 44:13.316
-So, what?
You got obsessed

44:13.318 --> 44:15.585
with like a bunch
of 20-year-old neanderthals?

44:15.587 --> 44:17.620
Live vicariously through them?
-I know it sounds crazy,

44:17.622 --> 44:21.057
but this is really important
to a lot of people, to me.

44:21.059 --> 44:23.559
If we lose,
i get depressed for like a week.

44:23.561 --> 44:25.428
-That's what makes you sad?

44:25.430 --> 44:26.763
A football game?

44:26.765 --> 44:28.097
-Will has done a lot
for this community.

44:28.099 --> 44:29.532
He's done a lot for the school.

44:29.534 --> 44:31.801
He has created jobs.
He has helped the economy.

44:31.803 --> 44:33.403
He built
the youth builders program.

44:33.405 --> 44:36.172
-You can say that about
literally every single coach.

44:36.174 --> 44:38.107
All he did was win a few games.
-It's not just that.

44:38.109 --> 44:40.243
Like, my -- my dad and I,
we didn't talk very much,

44:40.245 --> 44:42.078
but every Saturday
we were able to order pizza,

44:42.080 --> 44:44.280
sit on the couch,
and be in each other's presence

44:44.282 --> 44:46.149
while we watched the game.
-Oh, my god. Wait.

44:46.151 --> 44:48.418
Two men eating pizza,
watching football?

44:48.420 --> 44:50.787
Everybody does that.
Will didn't create that.

44:50.789 --> 44:52.855
Don't idolize him.
He's just a guy.

44:52.857 --> 44:55.158
-And to you, he's just a guy?

44:55.160 --> 44:56.726
-Yeah.

44:56.728 --> 44:59.228
-So, it wasn't the power?

44:59.230 --> 45:01.330
-The power?

45:01.332 --> 45:03.399
No.

45:03.401 --> 45:06.369
You don't know
what you're talking about.

45:06.371 --> 45:10.907
-So, please, enlighten me.

45:12.810 --> 45:14.010
Enlighten me.

45:14.012 --> 45:16.512
-Mnh-mnh.
-Come on.

45:16.514 --> 45:20.416
-Mnh-mnh.

45:20.418 --> 45:22.685
Well, I didn't even know
who he was when we met.

45:22.687 --> 45:24.687
-Really?

45:24.689 --> 45:25.922
-Really.

45:25.924 --> 45:27.690
-You didn't know
who will Campbell was?

45:27.692 --> 45:29.625
-No.
I'd only lived here for a year.

45:29.627 --> 45:32.328
And I already told you I don't
give a rat's ass about football.

45:32.330 --> 45:34.497
-Okay.
-He used to come into my bar

45:34.499 --> 45:38.534
after work every day and sneak
into a booth in the back,

45:38.536 --> 45:43.706
order a Sam Adams and work
on his fantasy novel,

45:43.708 --> 45:45.141
and I think that's really --

45:45.143 --> 45:47.777
-I'm sorry.

45:47.779 --> 45:49.779
Did you say fantasy novel?

45:49.781 --> 45:51.180
-Yes, I did.

45:51.182 --> 45:54.383
-With like wizards,
like elves and fairies?

45:54.385 --> 45:57.120
-There were no fairies, okay?
-Like minotaurs?

45:57.122 --> 45:57.987
-No.

45:57.989 --> 45:59.655
-Like half-man, half-tigers?

45:59.657 --> 46:01.257
-See, this attitude right here,

46:01.259 --> 46:03.392
this is why
he never told anyone --

46:03.394 --> 46:05.394
because of annoying stuff
like this.

46:05.396 --> 46:06.829
-What was it called?

46:06.831 --> 46:08.331
-There's no way
I'm telling you that.

46:08.333 --> 46:09.866
-Why?
-Because you're gonna make fun

46:09.868 --> 46:11.267
of it, and then
I'm gonna get mad,

46:11.269 --> 46:12.769
and then I'm gonna punch you,
and I'm tired.

46:12.771 --> 46:14.270
I don't want to do that
right now.

46:14.272 --> 46:16.105
-Fine. I won't make fun of it.
I won't laugh at it.

46:16.107 --> 46:18.975
I won't even --
i won't make a peep.

46:18.977 --> 46:22.211
Just tell me the title.

46:22.213 --> 46:24.147
-"The keepers of galnorea."

46:24.149 --> 46:26.816
- You kidding me?

46:26.818 --> 46:28.117
What was it about?

46:28.119 --> 46:30.353
Wizards who get gonorrhea?

46:30.355 --> 46:32.221
-It's a bad title.
I asked him to change it.

46:32.223 --> 46:34.223
He didn't want to change it.

46:34.225 --> 46:41.297
-So, how do you go from talking
about dragons with stds to...

46:43.433 --> 46:44.867
-What?
-To being --

46:44.869 --> 46:47.036
to being in-- inti--

46:47.038 --> 46:48.571
to, like, having whatever --

46:48.573 --> 46:50.640
-to having sex?

46:50.642 --> 46:52.775
-Yes.

46:52.777 --> 46:54.977
-He gave me a ride home
one night.

46:54.979 --> 46:57.079
And he invited himself up.

46:57.081 --> 46:58.848
He said we didn't have to have
sex because he was married

46:58.850 --> 47:01.717
and whatever,
but I knew what that meant,

47:01.719 --> 47:04.654
so I fucked his brains out
anyway.

47:04.656 --> 47:07.089
-Well, I guess everyone
got what they wanted.

47:07.091 --> 47:09.258
-Oh, god, you're so judgmental.
-I'm not judging.

47:09.260 --> 47:11.260
-You know,
i dated a lot of mean guys,

47:11.262 --> 47:15.598
and he's the only one who didn't
actively make me hate myself.

47:15.600 --> 47:17.300
-Yeah.

47:17.302 --> 47:22.839
He just made you want
to kill yourself.

47:22.841 --> 47:24.207
I'm sorry.
-Goodbye.

47:24.209 --> 47:27.844
-No. That was not cool.

47:30.280 --> 47:31.447
I didn't mean it.

47:31.449 --> 47:33.683
-It's fine.
-No, it's not fine.

47:33.685 --> 47:35.618
-No, really, it's fine.

47:35.620 --> 47:37.086
I didn't even get that right.

47:37.088 --> 47:39.689
I fucked up at fucking up.

47:39.691 --> 47:41.791
That's good.
-No.

47:41.793 --> 47:44.293
-That's good.

47:44.295 --> 47:47.730
-I am positive that if you
get another shot at it,

47:47.732 --> 47:51.067
you're gonna nail it.

47:51.069 --> 47:53.269
Just dead on impact.

47:53.271 --> 47:54.971
I'm assuming you jump
from something.

47:54.973 --> 47:56.839
- That's very mean.

47:56.841 --> 47:59.809
-Seriously,
i believe in you in that.

47:59.811 --> 48:02.044
-Thank you.

48:02.046 --> 48:03.779
-Did you really want to do it?

48:03.781 --> 48:05.648
For real?

48:05.650 --> 48:08.317
-That was the plan.
For real.

48:09.686 --> 48:12.588
I bought those pills
off some sketchy dude downtown.

48:12.590 --> 48:15.458
-Mort Stevens.
-Yeah, I don't
think he was mort.

48:15.460 --> 48:17.526
-How do you know? Could have
been -- anybody could be a mort.

48:17.528 --> 48:20.563
That's racist.

48:20.565 --> 48:22.331
-Touché.

48:22.333 --> 48:26.469
Anyway, I had those pills,
and I kept chickening out,

48:26.471 --> 48:31.173
so I decided that I would come
to the banquet.

48:31.175 --> 48:32.675
I knew tonight
was the last night

48:32.677 --> 48:35.344
that I'd be able to talk to will
before he goes to L.A.

48:35.346 --> 48:39.916
So I snuck in there and I guess
i was hoping

48:39.918 --> 48:45.588
he was gonna talk me out of it,
but that didn't really happen.

48:45.590 --> 48:49.492
-And then you picked me up
at the bar?

48:49.494 --> 48:50.893
-No.

48:50.895 --> 48:53.229
-Well, I wasn't hitting on you.
-Say that so casually,

48:53.231 --> 48:55.031
like it's the truth?
That's not the truth.

48:55.033 --> 48:56.899
-Well, what is the truth?
-You hit on me.

48:56.901 --> 48:58.601
-I did not do anything
like that.

48:58.603 --> 49:00.970
-You complimented my bag.
You said, "hey, nice bag."

49:00.972 --> 49:04.407
-Well, it was nice,
and I was being nice.

49:04.409 --> 49:06.742
-You wanted to get
into my pants.

49:06.744 --> 49:08.711
-You were wearing a dress.

49:08.713 --> 49:10.713
-Come on.

49:10.715 --> 49:13.649
-Fine. I was hitting on you.

49:13.651 --> 49:15.685
But you were the one that said
you wanted to take me home.

49:15.687 --> 49:18.688
-Well, yeah, once I realized
who you worked for,

49:18.690 --> 49:20.122
I thought it'd be
an extra little "fuck you"

49:20.124 --> 49:24.393
to bang you in will's bed.

49:24.395 --> 49:26.595
-Thank you.

49:26.597 --> 49:28.631
-Sorry.
-No.

49:28.633 --> 49:30.266
It's fine.

49:30.268 --> 49:33.235
-I'm a terrible person.

49:34.571 --> 49:36.806
And now the one solid thing
in my life

49:36.808 --> 49:39.542
has completely abandoned me.

49:39.544 --> 49:43.245
-Will was the one solid thing
in your life?

49:43.247 --> 49:46.816
-You know he was gonna
leave Sarah.

49:46.818 --> 49:47.917
-Oh.

49:47.919 --> 49:49.785
Yeah. I'm that girl.

49:49.787 --> 49:54.156
I'm that girl.

49:54.158 --> 49:57.760
Hey, he seduced both of us.

49:57.762 --> 49:59.295
-Yeah.

49:59.297 --> 50:02.765
Except I only
let him fuck me once.

50:02.767 --> 50:06.268
Twice if you count the one time
i let him finish in my mouth.

50:06.270 --> 50:07.737
-Oh!

50:07.739 --> 50:09.105
-I had to. He was my boss.

50:12.010 --> 50:13.709
-Yeah.

50:13.711 --> 50:16.979
It was a wise business decision.

50:16.981 --> 50:18.314
-You still sleepy?

50:18.316 --> 50:21.784
-I'm the most sleepiest
of all times.

50:21.786 --> 50:23.953
-Let's go outside.
-No.

50:23.955 --> 50:25.321
-Come on.
Let's get some fresh air.

50:25.323 --> 50:26.689
-There is airs in here.

50:26.691 --> 50:28.324
-You can have
one of your cigarettes.

50:28.326 --> 50:29.959
By the way, you should switch
to e-cigarettes.

50:29.961 --> 50:31.627
I've read a bunch of articles
that say it's better for you

50:31.629 --> 50:33.162
and it looks cool.
-Will you forward them to me?

50:33.164 --> 50:34.330
Thank you.
-Yeah, no problem.

50:34.332 --> 50:35.531
Come on.
Let's go outside.

50:35.533 --> 50:38.334
-No.

50:38.336 --> 50:40.936
-Come on.

50:40.938 --> 50:42.571
-Okay.

50:42.573 --> 50:44.006
-Let's go.
-You got it, buster.

50:44.008 --> 50:45.374
-I won't even drag you.

50:45.376 --> 50:46.909
-Thank you,
'cause you hurt me last time.

50:46.911 --> 50:47.943
-I know.
I'm sorry about that.

50:47.945 --> 50:49.345
I felt it -- I felt it --

50:49.347 --> 50:52.581
-you've been
throwing me around all night.

50:55.352 --> 50:57.753
-Why don't we go
in the pool, huh?

50:57.755 --> 51:00.356
-Fuck no.
It's freezing. Are you crazy?

51:00.358 --> 51:02.158
-What do you mean?
These conditions are perfect.

51:02.160 --> 51:05.628
-Yeah, looks positively balmy.

51:05.630 --> 51:08.497
-Ideal.

51:08.499 --> 51:11.000
-It's too cold.
-I love going in bodies of water

51:11.002 --> 51:14.336
when you can see
your own breath.

51:14.338 --> 51:15.704
-Do you?

51:15.706 --> 51:18.774
-Oh, yeah.

51:18.776 --> 51:21.944
So, what -- what --
you're a bartender, right?

51:21.946 --> 51:23.712
-Yep.

51:23.714 --> 51:25.414
-What's the five-year plan
there?

51:25.416 --> 51:27.716
-Oh, my god. What are you?
My guidance counselor?

51:27.718 --> 51:29.819
-No, I just want to know.

51:29.821 --> 51:32.221
-I don't have a plan.

51:32.223 --> 51:33.689
I was never very good
at planning.

51:33.691 --> 51:34.890
-What are you good at?

51:34.892 --> 51:38.794
-I don't know, man.
Blowjobs.

51:38.796 --> 51:42.131
-Yeah, you're good at those.

51:42.133 --> 51:46.402
-I rest my case.

51:46.404 --> 51:48.137
-You play a nice violin.

51:48.139 --> 51:50.673
-I gave that up in the ninth
grade along with debate club

51:50.675 --> 51:51.674
and my virginity.

51:51.676 --> 51:52.908
-You write really nicely.

51:52.910 --> 51:54.410
-How would you know that?

51:54.412 --> 51:56.579
-That suicide note
really flowed.

51:56.581 --> 52:00.149
-It was mostly bumper
sticker wisdom, you know.

52:00.151 --> 52:02.485
I have a gift.

52:02.487 --> 52:06.422
What about you?
What's your plan?

52:06.424 --> 52:09.191
-Well, I hope to get
a graduate assistant position

52:09.193 --> 52:10.626
in a few years,
then maybe move up

52:10.628 --> 52:12.428
to an assistant coach
on will's staff.

52:12.430 --> 52:14.830
Then after that hopefully parlay
it into a head coaching gig

52:14.832 --> 52:19.034
somewhere at a small school
that I can make some noise,

52:19.036 --> 52:20.269
just like will did.

52:20.271 --> 52:24.340
-Like will,
like will, like will.

52:24.342 --> 52:25.608
If you're not careful,
you're gonna waste

52:25.610 --> 52:27.209
your whole life
on that stupid game.

52:27.211 --> 52:29.211
-It's not stupid.

52:29.213 --> 52:31.180
Hundreds of players
will tell you

52:31.182 --> 52:33.449
that will is like
a father to them.

52:33.451 --> 52:35.217
That means something.

52:39.323 --> 52:40.990
I'm good at cooking.

52:40.992 --> 52:42.424
-That's cool.

52:42.426 --> 52:43.859
-Don't patronize me.

52:43.861 --> 52:46.228
-No, I think that's awesome.
You should like --

52:46.230 --> 52:47.463
-don't say it.
-What?

52:47.465 --> 52:49.732
-"You should open up
a restaurant."

52:49.734 --> 52:50.966
That's you.

52:50.968 --> 52:52.635
-Spot-on impression of me.

52:52.637 --> 52:54.203
-Right?

52:54.205 --> 52:57.339
-You're good at impressions.

52:57.341 --> 52:59.642
So what's your specialty?
-Jack Nicholson.

52:59.644 --> 53:03.612
-I meant what's your,
like, recipe?

53:03.614 --> 53:04.914
-Are we still talking
about this?

53:04.916 --> 53:07.349
-I'm interested.
-What is <i> your</i> specialty?

53:07.351 --> 53:10.219
-Chinese takeout.
I crush it every time.

53:10.221 --> 53:11.353
-Good one.
-Come on.

53:11.355 --> 53:12.421
I'm serious.
I want to know.

53:12.423 --> 53:13.622
I watch a lot of cooking shows.

53:13.624 --> 53:16.358
-I don't have, like,
a specialty.

53:16.360 --> 53:18.360
I don't make one thing,
you know.

53:18.362 --> 53:20.429
I just -- I can whip up a meal

53:20.431 --> 53:22.231
with anything
you have in your cupboards.

53:22.233 --> 53:23.599
That's my jam.

53:23.601 --> 53:26.802
-So you're like a food genie.

53:26.804 --> 53:29.271
-No, but just something

53:29.273 --> 53:30.906
me and my friends
do every once in awhile.

53:30.908 --> 53:32.942
Like I'll make the food and
they'll bring the booze 'cause

53:32.944 --> 53:35.344
we're all broke as fuck.

53:35.346 --> 53:37.479
-I don't see my friends
that much.

53:37.481 --> 53:38.948
By the time I get off campus,

53:38.950 --> 53:41.884
they're either home in their own
bed or wasted drunk,

53:41.886 --> 53:44.720
and it's like I have
to take care of them.

53:44.722 --> 53:47.389
-Sounds lonely.

53:47.391 --> 53:49.858
-Hmm. Keeps me focused.

53:49.860 --> 53:51.460
-Wow.

53:51.462 --> 53:54.797
You sound exactly like will.

53:54.799 --> 53:57.733
-Well, will always said the key
to success

53:57.735 --> 53:59.702
is preparation and persistence.

53:59.704 --> 54:01.870
-Yeah, I know.

54:01.872 --> 54:07.943
I've seen the fucking t-shirts
and the koozies.

54:07.945 --> 54:09.078
All right.

54:09.080 --> 54:10.346
I'm cold.

54:10.348 --> 54:13.249
Let's go inside.

54:13.251 --> 54:16.318
-Okay.

54:16.320 --> 54:18.020
Can you help me up?

54:18.022 --> 54:19.688
-All right.

54:19.690 --> 54:22.925
You mother --

54:22.927 --> 54:24.927
oh! Oh! Oh!

54:24.929 --> 54:27.263
-I'm sorry! I didn't think
it would be this cold!

54:27.265 --> 54:29.465
What a dumb mistake!
I'm so sorry!

54:29.467 --> 54:31.667
I'm so sorry!
-Oh! Oh, my god!

54:31.669 --> 54:33.168
-Are you okay?!
-Oh, my god!

54:33.170 --> 54:35.104
-I'm so sorry!
-Oh, my --

54:37.074 --> 54:39.708
you fucker.

54:42.679 --> 54:45.681
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

54:50.253 --> 54:52.688
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

54:52.690 --> 54:54.356
-You're sorry?
-I'm sorry. It's just --

54:54.358 --> 54:56.725
I didn't -- I didn't know
how to keep you awake.

54:56.727 --> 54:58.594
-Want to keep me awake,
just say "hey!"

54:58.596 --> 55:01.096
-Just say "hey"? I-i-i-i --

55:01.098 --> 55:02.698
I don't know
if that's like the strongest --

55:02.700 --> 55:03.732
-just say "hey!"

55:03.734 --> 55:06.969
-Can you hand me a towel,
please?

55:10.273 --> 55:15.744
Got a pool in the winter,
you want to heat it, you know?

55:19.684 --> 55:22.084
-Why are you breathing so loud?

55:22.086 --> 55:25.821
-I'm not good at being cold.

55:25.823 --> 55:28.590
-Come here.

55:32.629 --> 55:36.098
Come on. Open your towel.
We need body heat.

55:36.100 --> 55:38.867
-Okay. Yeah.

55:40.303 --> 55:42.871
-Okay.

55:58.455 --> 56:02.291
-Why are you hard?

56:02.293 --> 56:03.459
-I'm --

56:03.461 --> 56:06.295
-oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

56:06.297 --> 56:09.131
No, no.

56:09.133 --> 56:10.733
No.

56:10.735 --> 56:13.569
-Tough moment to read, you know?

56:13.571 --> 56:15.838
-Don't follow me with it.

56:50.306 --> 56:53.275
-What are you doing?

56:53.277 --> 56:55.477
-I'm just whipping something up.

56:55.479 --> 56:57.746
I'm hungry.

56:57.748 --> 56:59.715
-Yeah?

56:59.717 --> 57:03.152
What are you making
with milk and sriracha sauce?

57:03.154 --> 57:04.353
-Don't sound so disgusted.

57:04.355 --> 57:06.655
This is a thing that I make.
God.

57:06.657 --> 57:08.056
-Okay,
you're making a lot of it.

57:08.058 --> 57:10.859
-Well, I'm making enough
for when Peter gets here.

57:10.861 --> 57:13.695
-How do you know
Peter's showing up?

57:13.697 --> 57:15.264
Okay, he just wants to
talk to you.

57:15.266 --> 57:18.667
-Yeah, just a sweet, little
convo between two friends.

57:18.669 --> 57:20.068
-What? Do you think
he's gonna threaten you?

57:20.070 --> 57:22.004
-I am sure they're going
to intimidate me, yeah.

57:22.006 --> 57:24.440
They'll try, at least.
-You can handle that, right?

57:24.442 --> 57:25.874
You're tough.

57:25.876 --> 57:29.077
-Okay. Listen.
This is how it's gonna go down.

57:29.079 --> 57:30.813
Peter's gonna show up
with a blank check

57:30.815 --> 57:33.982
to find out how much
it costs to keep my mouth shut.

57:33.984 --> 57:35.350
-Yeah right.

57:35.352 --> 57:36.385
-Just wait and see.

57:36.387 --> 57:39.121
You'll -- okay.

57:39.123 --> 57:41.857
-Sounds crazy.

57:41.859 --> 57:43.025
-Hey, hey!

57:43.027 --> 57:44.159
-Oh!
-Sorry.

57:44.161 --> 57:45.661
These are for the dish.

57:45.663 --> 57:50.065
I need that back,
actually, so can I have that?

57:50.067 --> 57:52.768
-How much would it cost?
-How much would it cost to what?

57:52.770 --> 57:58.440
-How much would it cost
for you not to say anything?

58:00.244 --> 58:02.811
-Well, I've never had more than
$1,000 in my bank account,

58:02.813 --> 58:04.680
so most days
you can get me pretty cheap.

58:04.682 --> 58:07.015
-But not today.
-No.

58:07.017 --> 58:09.618
Not today.

58:09.620 --> 58:12.788
Hell hath no fury
and the scorn of the woman.

58:12.790 --> 58:14.756
-Scorn of women.
I think -- yeah,

58:14.758 --> 58:16.592
that's how that goes.
-You know what I mean.

58:16.594 --> 58:18.527
-Let's just play this out
for a second, okay?

58:18.529 --> 58:19.828
You go to the press.

58:19.830 --> 58:21.497
They rake will over the coals.

58:21.499 --> 58:22.931
They crucify him.

58:22.933 --> 58:25.601
His wife does the whole
"stand by your man" thing

58:25.603 --> 58:27.269
then will goes back to coaching.

58:27.271 --> 58:29.238
He wins a couple big games.

58:29.240 --> 58:31.073
The press looks at it
like a redemption story.

58:31.075 --> 58:32.708
And then where does that
leave you?

58:32.710 --> 58:34.943
-Bahamas.
-You become a trashy girl

58:34.945 --> 58:36.678
that tried
to break up his marriage.

58:36.680 --> 58:39.281
-Yeah, you're right.
You're absolutely right.

58:41.885 --> 58:44.553
I mean...

58:44.555 --> 58:46.889
If it were <i> just</i> an affair.

58:46.891 --> 58:48.490
But...

58:48.492 --> 58:50.759
It's more than that.

58:50.761 --> 58:53.529
-It's more than that.
-Huh?

58:53.531 --> 58:57.833
-It's more than that.
What?

58:57.835 --> 59:01.370
-I can't -- I can't ruin
your perception of Saint will.

59:01.372 --> 59:03.672
You love him.

59:03.674 --> 59:05.073
-I don't think this will ruin it

59:05.075 --> 59:08.977
after what I've been
through tonight.

59:08.979 --> 59:09.845
-Okay.

59:09.847 --> 59:11.079
Remember when all the --
i can't.

59:11.081 --> 59:13.115
I can't do it.
-Just tell me.

59:13.117 --> 59:15.751
-Remember when all those schools
were recruiting Kyle Walker?

59:15.753 --> 59:18.287
-Yeah, of course.
Usc, ucla, 'bama,

59:18.289 --> 59:19.721
Texas, Nebraska, Arizona.
-Yeah, shh, shh, shh.

59:19.723 --> 59:21.223
No one cares.

59:21.225 --> 59:23.358
Basically all those schools
were jizzing themself

59:23.360 --> 59:25.460
to get Kyle Walker.
-Yeah.

59:25.462 --> 59:27.763
-And then he went
to Allen state?

59:27.765 --> 59:29.498
-He wanted to play for will.

59:29.500 --> 59:31.166
-Have you seen those girls
at usc?

59:31.168 --> 59:35.003
I'm talking like...

59:35.005 --> 59:36.805
-What is that?
-They're hot.

59:36.807 --> 59:38.173
-Look, when you graduate
high school

59:38.175 --> 59:40.008
and you're serious
about college football,

59:40.010 --> 59:42.377
you know the value of being
coached by a living legend.

59:42.379 --> 59:44.613
-Kevin, they paid him.

59:44.615 --> 59:46.048
-Bullshit.
-They paid him.

59:46.050 --> 59:47.849
-That is bullshit.
-I'm telling you the truth.

59:47.851 --> 59:49.217
They paid him.
I was there.

59:49.219 --> 59:51.019
I went on that trip
with will to Houston.

59:51.021 --> 59:54.990
He rolls up to Kyle Walker's
house in a brand-new range rover

59:54.992 --> 59:57.626
and then he takes a cab home?
-So what?

59:57.628 --> 59:59.728
Doesn't mean anything.
-Okay.

59:59.730 --> 01:00:01.263
Well, the championship's
on Monday.

01:00:01.265 --> 01:00:03.532
What do you think will happen
if I leak

01:00:03.534 --> 01:00:04.833
that little tidbit to the press?

01:00:04.835 --> 01:00:06.802
-The ncaa would do
a thorough investigation

01:00:06.804 --> 01:00:11.740
and come up with nothing
because will does not cheat.

01:00:11.742 --> 01:00:13.308
At football.

01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:15.243
-Well, if they looked into it,
they would find plenty.

01:00:15.245 --> 01:00:16.845
And then his whole staff --
and you --

01:00:16.847 --> 01:00:18.547
would be up shit's creek
without a paddle,

01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:20.449
and I don't think the community
would like that very much.

01:00:20.451 --> 01:00:23.785
-Look, obviously I've heard
the rumors any time

01:00:23.787 --> 01:00:25.787
a five-star blue-chip recruit

01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:27.489
comes to a small school
like this.

01:00:27.491 --> 01:00:30.692
And with all the things
that will has done for Allen,

01:00:30.694 --> 01:00:32.194
there's gonna be chatter,
obviously.

01:00:32.196 --> 01:00:34.062
-Hey, hey.
I'm telling you first-hand,

01:00:34.064 --> 01:00:37.466
as a first-hand account,
I'm the source.

01:00:37.468 --> 01:00:40.369
-Will would never do that.

01:00:40.371 --> 01:00:42.437
-Okay, come here.
Come on.

01:00:42.439 --> 01:00:43.972
We're going on a trip.

01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:46.775
Come on.

01:00:52.916 --> 01:00:54.182
Awesome.

01:00:54.184 --> 01:00:55.651
-I know.

01:00:55.653 --> 01:00:59.054
Kind of overwhelming for such
a famously modest guy, right?

01:00:59.056 --> 01:01:02.491
-Wow. This ball was signed
by all the captains

01:01:02.493 --> 01:01:07.329
of the '03 sugar bowl victory.

01:01:07.331 --> 01:01:10.332
-Don't forget all of
these beautifully framed posters

01:01:10.334 --> 01:01:11.800
praising will's genius.

01:01:11.802 --> 01:01:14.302
-He's a pretty good
football coach.

01:01:14.304 --> 01:01:15.737
He's only human.

01:01:15.739 --> 01:01:19.374
-This is a narcissistic shrine
that he made

01:01:19.376 --> 01:01:21.543
and gave to himself.

01:01:21.545 --> 01:01:23.245
Nobody knows this guy.

01:01:23.247 --> 01:01:26.615
They all think
he's some modest family man.

01:01:26.617 --> 01:01:28.550
-Don't you know him?

01:01:28.552 --> 01:01:30.352
Isn't he the real will with you?

01:01:30.354 --> 01:01:34.122
-I don't think
anyone really knows anyone.

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:38.694
-Well, I mean, I don't think
that takes away

01:01:38.696 --> 01:01:40.062
from his coaching
accomplishments

01:01:40.064 --> 01:01:42.264
or the fact
that he's changed the culture --

01:01:42.266 --> 01:01:46.134
-he has created an unattainable
standard for living

01:01:46.136 --> 01:01:47.869
that you try to live up to,

01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:50.605
that he doesn't even
try to live up to.

01:01:50.607 --> 01:01:52.941
-Well...

01:01:52.943 --> 01:01:56.445
It doesn't seem so bad to try.

01:01:56.447 --> 01:01:59.748
I don't know what to tell you.

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:29.377
-Look, I'm just saying you don't
have to put so much pressure

01:02:29.379 --> 01:02:32.314
on yourself, you know?

01:02:32.316 --> 01:02:34.182
You could have a real life
outside this thing.

01:02:34.184 --> 01:02:35.317
Will does.

01:02:35.319 --> 01:02:36.852
-I'm perfectly happy
with my life, thank you.

01:02:36.854 --> 01:02:38.487
-You told me
you never see your friends.

01:02:38.489 --> 01:02:40.222
And when was the last time
you even had a girlfriend?

01:02:40.224 --> 01:02:42.190
-That's none of your business.

01:02:42.192 --> 01:02:44.326
-Well, we just had sex, so it's
kind of sort of my business.

01:02:44.328 --> 01:02:46.294
-It's really not.

01:02:46.296 --> 01:02:47.095
-Oh, my god.

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:48.663
Why are you getting touchy?

01:02:48.665 --> 01:02:49.698
-I'm not getting touchy.

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:51.433
-Have we hit a nerve? Huh?

01:02:51.435 --> 01:02:54.169
-Will you please stop
kicking me?

01:02:54.171 --> 01:02:56.605
-Was tonight your first time?

01:02:56.607 --> 01:02:57.939
You have to tell me if it was.

01:02:57.941 --> 01:03:00.842
-Did it feel like my first time?

01:03:00.844 --> 01:03:03.779
Don't answer that.

01:03:03.781 --> 01:03:07.315
-Do you even go on dates?

01:03:07.317 --> 01:03:11.086
Are you on okcupid?
Nerdlove.Com?

01:03:11.088 --> 01:03:12.320
-This conversation is over.

01:03:12.322 --> 01:03:13.722
-Well, we have to talk
about something.

01:03:13.724 --> 01:03:15.056
-Is nerdlove.Com
even a real website?

01:03:15.058 --> 01:03:16.525
-If we don't --
I'm falling asleep.

01:03:16.527 --> 01:03:18.426
I'm gonna fall asleep
if you don't tell me.

01:03:18.428 --> 01:03:20.662
-Fine. We will go through
my entire relationship history,

01:03:20.664 --> 01:03:22.631
but that means that we have
to go through yours, as well.

01:03:22.633 --> 01:03:23.899
-That's fine with me.

01:03:23.901 --> 01:03:27.669
I just don't think
you can handle it.

01:03:27.671 --> 01:03:30.772
-Try me.

01:03:33.177 --> 01:03:37.179
-He started openly hitting on
other girls in front of me.

01:03:37.181 --> 01:03:38.880
-That's terrible.
What'd you do?

01:03:38.882 --> 01:03:39.981
Break up with him?

01:03:39.983 --> 01:03:42.384
-Hell no.
-Why?

01:03:42.386 --> 01:03:45.086
-Uh, because that's what
he wanted, obviously.

01:03:45.088 --> 01:03:46.755
He wasn't man enough
to break up with me himself,

01:03:46.757 --> 01:03:50.859
so he passive aggressively tried
to get me to break up with him.

01:03:50.861 --> 01:03:52.360
-So you just stuck it out?

01:03:52.362 --> 01:03:53.995
-Yeah.

01:03:53.997 --> 01:03:56.298
I couldn't lose.

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:57.532
-That's good.

01:03:57.534 --> 01:03:59.835
It always important
for a relationship to feel

01:03:59.837 --> 01:04:01.736
like there's a winner
and a loser.

01:04:01.738 --> 01:04:03.972
-Well, technically, I won 'cause

01:04:03.974 --> 01:04:05.640
I got to stay
six months rent-free

01:04:05.642 --> 01:04:07.509
in a dope-ass apartment.

01:04:07.511 --> 01:04:10.078
-Doesn't seem worth it to me.
-Washer/dryer in unit.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:11.379
-You know what?
Forget I said anything.

01:04:11.381 --> 01:04:12.881
You should have
stayed there forever.

01:04:12.883 --> 01:04:14.149
-No.

01:04:14.151 --> 01:04:15.550
-Even if you were being abused.

01:04:15.552 --> 01:04:17.786
I would have said stick it out.

01:04:17.788 --> 01:04:21.022
-Do that laundry
at your leisure.

01:04:21.024 --> 01:04:24.559
-Yeah. Worth it.

01:04:24.561 --> 01:04:27.062
-Now, this is Steve
we're talking about, right?

01:04:27.064 --> 01:04:29.030
-No, no, no, no.
Steve was the ankle fetish.

01:04:29.032 --> 01:04:30.765
-Steve was the ankle fetish.
-Weirdo.

01:04:30.767 --> 01:04:32.033
No, this is --
-Brian?

01:04:32.035 --> 01:04:33.134
-Brent.
-Brent.

01:04:33.136 --> 01:04:34.502
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

01:04:34.504 --> 01:04:36.204
No, it's okay.
It's a lot to keep track of.

01:04:36.206 --> 01:04:38.773
-What are you implying?

01:04:38.775 --> 01:04:40.041
-Nothing.

01:04:40.043 --> 01:04:41.276
-You're trying to say
I'm a whore.

01:04:41.278 --> 01:04:42.777
-No, I am not.
-Yes, you are.

01:04:42.779 --> 01:04:44.346
-I would never -- no.
-It's fine.

01:04:44.348 --> 01:04:45.647
I kinda am.

01:04:45.649 --> 01:04:48.083
-No, you're not.

01:04:48.085 --> 01:04:49.818
You're being really hard
on yourself.

01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:52.020
-I'm not being hard on myself.

01:04:52.022 --> 01:04:55.590
It's the men
who have been hard on me.

01:04:55.592 --> 01:04:57.025
-In you.

01:04:57.027 --> 01:04:58.260
-In me, on me.
-Okay.

01:04:58.262 --> 01:04:59.394
-Play me like a drum.
-Stop it.

01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:00.862
-You don't want to go on?
Okay.

01:05:00.864 --> 01:05:02.063
-Play you like a drum?

01:05:02.065 --> 01:05:03.665
-With their dicks.
-Yeah, I got it.

01:05:03.667 --> 01:05:05.066
-Yeah.

01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:06.735
-I don't like --
i don't want to think about it.

01:05:06.737 --> 01:05:09.104
- Sorry.

01:05:09.106 --> 01:05:12.440
-What's -- you know,
how many dudes we talking?

01:05:12.442 --> 01:05:14.709
-I don't have a number
off the top of my head.

01:05:14.711 --> 01:05:16.278
-There's no final tally?

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:19.614
-I don't tally them every day.
I'm not in jail like...

01:05:19.616 --> 01:05:22.183
-What's your number?
I'll give you mine.

01:05:22.185 --> 01:05:23.818
-I got to think about it.

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:25.353
-Well, me too.
-Okay.

01:05:25.355 --> 01:05:27.222
Let's think.
-Let's think together.

01:05:27.224 --> 01:05:30.458
-Okay.

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:32.460
-I got a guesstimate.
-Yeah, I need one second.

01:05:32.462 --> 01:05:34.229
Hold on.
-Oh, boy.

01:05:34.231 --> 01:05:38.300
I instantly regret doing this.

01:05:38.302 --> 01:05:39.734
-Justin.

01:05:39.736 --> 01:05:42.337
-What?

01:05:42.339 --> 01:05:43.805
-Okay.

01:05:43.807 --> 01:05:46.508
I am ready.

01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:47.776
-Okay, you first.

01:05:47.778 --> 01:05:49.577
-I'm not going first 'cause
then you'll just --

01:05:49.579 --> 01:05:51.313
you'll hear my number and then
you're gonna change yours.

01:05:51.315 --> 01:05:53.181
-We'll go at the same time.
-Okay, that sounds fair.

01:05:53.183 --> 01:05:54.849
-On the count of three.
-Okay.

01:05:54.851 --> 01:05:56.318
-Three --
-wait, wait, wait.

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:57.652
Does the other girl
in a threesome count?

01:05:57.654 --> 01:06:00.588
-What?

01:06:00.590 --> 01:06:01.690
-Are you having a stroke?

01:06:01.692 --> 01:06:03.024
-No, I'm -- I'm --

01:06:03.026 --> 01:06:04.259
I'd love to hear
more about that specific --

01:06:04.261 --> 01:06:06.661
-just do the countdown.
-Okay.

01:06:06.663 --> 01:06:07.929
Three...

01:06:07.931 --> 01:06:10.198
-Two, one.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.600
-8.
-8.

01:06:12.602 --> 01:06:13.668
-We have the same number.

01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:15.737
-Yeah, crazy.

01:06:15.739 --> 01:06:16.905
-Ha!
-Weird.

01:06:16.907 --> 01:06:19.474
-We have the same number.

01:06:22.278 --> 01:06:24.145
-It's actually 12.
-Yeah, mine's 6.

01:06:24.147 --> 01:06:25.313
-Six is respectable.

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:27.082
-No, it's embarrassing.

01:06:27.084 --> 01:06:28.917
You've been with
the right number of people

01:06:28.919 --> 01:06:30.185
for someone your age.

01:06:30.187 --> 01:06:31.519
I've been with like no one.

01:06:31.521 --> 01:06:33.655
-Yeah, that is kind
of embarrassing.

01:06:33.657 --> 01:06:35.190
I'm just kidding.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

01:06:35.192 --> 01:06:37.892
I wish I could take a lot
of mine back.

01:06:37.894 --> 01:06:39.995
-I'd take one back.

01:06:39.997 --> 01:06:41.363
-Ouch.

01:06:41.365 --> 01:06:42.230
Me?

01:06:42.232 --> 01:06:45.567
-No, actually, not you.

01:06:47.536 --> 01:06:48.536
-19.

01:06:48.538 --> 01:06:51.039
-Mine's actually 4 1/2.
-1/2?

01:06:51.041 --> 01:06:52.474
-I didn't finish.

01:06:52.476 --> 01:06:54.909
-I think it counts
if you've got your penis in.

01:06:54.911 --> 01:06:56.244
-Oh, I got in.
-It counts.

01:06:56.246 --> 01:06:57.445
That counts as sex.

01:06:57.447 --> 01:06:59.614
-Okay, so then
it's a solid five.

01:06:59.616 --> 01:07:06.121
-I am very honored to be
the fifth notch in your bedpost.

01:07:06.123 --> 01:07:10.658
-Technically
it's in will's bedpost.

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:11.926
-Yeah, I know.

01:07:11.928 --> 01:07:13.028
I know it well.

01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:15.797
-Ah. No, no, no, no, no.

01:07:15.799 --> 01:07:17.599
-Sorry.

01:07:17.601 --> 01:07:21.236
-What did you get
out of that relationship?

01:07:21.238 --> 01:07:25.840
-This is gonna sound cheesy.
I don't want to say.

01:07:25.842 --> 01:07:28.343
Will believed in me.

01:07:28.345 --> 01:07:31.346
He pushed me to do things.

01:07:31.348 --> 01:07:33.148
And I have a habit of not
following through all the way,

01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:36.051
so that was really good for me.

01:07:36.053 --> 01:07:37.619
He's the one who told me
to take cooking classes.

01:07:37.621 --> 01:07:39.387
I would have never done that
in a million years.

01:07:39.389 --> 01:07:41.189
I would have made fun of it

01:07:41.191 --> 01:07:43.091
and then I would have not
followed through

01:07:43.093 --> 01:07:44.392
and then I would have wished
that I had.

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:45.593
-Well, he was right on point
with that.

01:07:45.595 --> 01:07:47.395
I want to live
in this casserole.

01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:48.696
-Yeah?
-Seriously.

01:07:48.698 --> 01:07:50.198
I want to pay taxes
to this casserole.

01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:55.336
See?

01:08:01.243 --> 01:08:03.445
-No, no, no, no.
What are you doing?

01:08:03.447 --> 01:08:04.913
-I'm cleaning up.
-No.

01:08:04.915 --> 01:08:06.815
We're not cleaning up.
We don't have to clean up.

01:08:06.817 --> 01:08:08.349
-It's rude.

01:08:08.351 --> 01:08:13.054
-I forbid you from doing
anything responsible forever.

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:18.526
Oh, my god.
You really don't know how to be.

01:08:18.528 --> 01:08:22.397
-I don't know
what to do with myself.

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:25.533
-Come on.

01:08:25.535 --> 01:08:27.868
-Safe.

01:08:32.575 --> 01:08:34.843
Wh-- ah.

01:08:41.884 --> 01:08:44.586
Ooh, it's nice out here.

01:08:48.424 --> 01:08:51.192
This is really nice.

01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:56.264
What are we doing?

01:08:56.265 --> 01:08:57.698
-Will you relax?

01:08:57.701 --> 01:08:59.968
-I'm relaxed.
I love -- I love being up high.

01:08:59.970 --> 01:09:01.970
--I feel good, I feel good.

01:09:01.971 --> 01:09:05.840
The air is nice and cool
up here.

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:07.442
What's going on?

01:09:07.444 --> 01:09:10.310
-The sun's gonna come up soon.

01:09:10.313 --> 01:09:12.714
-Yeah, it tends to do that.

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:17.719
-I survived the night.

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:20.321
-Yes, you did.
No thanks to you.

01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:21.923
-I could jump off this roof
right now.

01:09:21.925 --> 01:09:24.591
-Well, please help me inside
before you do 'cause i-i --

01:09:24.594 --> 01:09:27.162
-yeah, no problem.
That'll only take 45 minutes.

01:09:27.163 --> 01:09:28.830
--I might change my mind.

01:09:28.832 --> 01:09:32.567
-I'm winded, too.

01:09:32.569 --> 01:09:34.801
-Thank you.

01:09:34.804 --> 01:09:38.006
I really appreciate it.

01:09:38.008 --> 01:09:40.774
-No problem.

01:09:40.777 --> 01:09:43.745
-You know, I really thought
i wanted to do it.

01:09:43.747 --> 01:09:46.714
But there was this moment when
i was drifting off

01:09:46.716 --> 01:09:48.249
that I thought...

01:09:48.251 --> 01:09:52.053
"No. Oh, shit."

01:09:52.055 --> 01:09:53.688
-You know, you did take me here.

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:55.557
You could have done this
by yourself.

01:09:55.559 --> 01:09:57.358
I f--

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:01.663
I feel like you wanted
to be found someway.

01:10:01.665 --> 01:10:03.631
-Yeah, you're probably right.

01:10:06.336 --> 01:10:09.103
-You know,
i thought about it once.

01:10:09.105 --> 01:10:11.372
-I think everybody
thinks about it.

01:10:11.374 --> 01:10:14.342
-I did more than think about it.

01:10:14.344 --> 01:10:16.878
Senior year,
i drove my dad's car into a tree

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:18.746
and told everyone
i fell asleep at the wheel.

01:10:18.748 --> 01:10:20.715
-Oh, my god.

01:10:20.717 --> 01:10:22.817
-I was going
through a really tough time.

01:10:22.819 --> 01:10:26.254
I wanted to be
valedictorian so bad.

01:10:26.256 --> 01:10:29.357
There was this kid, Steve Kim.

01:10:29.359 --> 01:10:30.992
We were like neck-and-neck.

01:10:30.994 --> 01:10:33.661
I beat that motherfucker.

01:10:33.663 --> 01:10:37.899
I was the valedictorian
of my high school.

01:10:37.901 --> 01:10:40.702
I gave the speech at graduation.

01:10:40.704 --> 01:10:45.873
I thought for sure
i would feel like...

01:10:45.875 --> 01:10:47.475
Fulfilled or something.

01:10:47.477 --> 01:10:51.212
-Yeah.
-I didn't.

01:10:51.214 --> 01:10:55.817
I felt the same way
i had before.

01:10:55.819 --> 01:11:00.021
That's when I realized
my life would be a series

01:11:00.023 --> 01:11:02.991
of fights with the Steve Kims
of the world.

01:11:04.461 --> 01:11:10.999
-And it just seemed daunting
because even if you win,

01:11:11.001 --> 01:11:12.800
it all feels the same.

01:11:12.802 --> 01:11:15.270
-I think you're better off
than Steve Kim.

01:11:15.272 --> 01:11:18.206
You saved a life...

01:11:18.208 --> 01:11:19.474
Cool khakis.

01:11:19.476 --> 01:11:21.142
-He's a partner in instagram.

01:11:21.144 --> 01:11:23.478
-Hmm.

01:11:25.447 --> 01:11:28.916
-Thank you.
I like my khakis.

01:11:35.824 --> 01:11:37.425
Anyway, I walked away
without a scratch.

01:11:37.427 --> 01:11:39.861
Totaled the car.
-Wow. You are so lucky.

01:11:39.863 --> 01:11:41.763
-That is not luck.
-That's luck.

01:11:41.765 --> 01:11:45.600
-That was a saab. That is
good, ol' Swedish engineering.

01:11:45.602 --> 01:11:47.468
Those things are tanks.

01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:49.937
-You trying to sell me
a saab right now?

01:11:49.939 --> 01:11:51.506
-No, I just, you know,

01:11:51.508 --> 01:11:53.041
if I could have you
look over here...

01:11:56.146 --> 01:11:59.681
Anyway, my dad...

01:11:59.683 --> 01:12:05.253
He gave me this
as like something

01:12:05.255 --> 01:12:07.822
to remember the accident by.

01:12:07.824 --> 01:12:11.225
He has no idea
what I think of every time

01:12:11.227 --> 01:12:14.662
I go to look at it.

01:12:55.672 --> 01:12:57.972
Shit.

01:13:00.743 --> 01:13:03.244
Sorry.

01:13:03.246 --> 01:13:05.480
-Go ahead.

01:13:07.349 --> 01:13:10.952
-Hey, Peter.

01:13:10.954 --> 01:13:12.954
Uh, yeah.

01:13:24.466 --> 01:13:27.468
Yeah.

01:13:53.495 --> 01:13:56.864
Madeline?

01:13:58.934 --> 01:14:02.170
Hello?

01:14:06.575 --> 01:14:11.312
Hi. Uh, just, um,
just hold on for one second.

01:14:16.318 --> 01:14:20.121
Hey.

01:14:20.123 --> 01:14:21.689
Hey.

01:14:21.691 --> 01:14:22.957
You're not gonna find them.

01:14:22.959 --> 01:14:25.059
-Leave me alone.

01:14:25.061 --> 01:14:26.627
- You have a phone call.

01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:27.962
-I just want to go home.

01:14:27.964 --> 01:14:29.497
-There's someone
that wants to speak to you.

01:14:29.499 --> 01:14:33.367
-I don't want to talk to Peter.

01:14:33.369 --> 01:14:35.970
-It's not Peter.

01:14:39.174 --> 01:14:42.043
-What?

01:14:54.823 --> 01:14:57.358
Will?

01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:00.761
Come on. Don't tell me that.

01:15:02.564 --> 01:15:04.999
Nope.

01:15:05.001 --> 01:15:09.003
I don't really think
that's appropriate to ask.

01:15:17.513 --> 01:15:20.948
Okay.

01:15:31.059 --> 01:15:33.828
Yeah, right.

01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:36.964
And if I'm not here?

01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:43.905
You can try.

01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:06.193
-So, they'll be here
in 20 minutes.

01:16:10.732 --> 01:16:14.168
Will wants to see me.

01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:21.142
-Then you got what you wanted,
right?

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:28.115
I'm gonna clean up.

01:16:29.084 --> 01:16:31.485
-You know, it was Peter
who told him not to talk to me.

01:16:31.487 --> 01:16:32.987
-Uh-huh.

01:16:32.989 --> 01:16:35.890
Yeah, will had no problem
following through with that.

01:16:35.892 --> 01:16:40.061
Super happy for you.
It's gonna work out great.

01:16:42.297 --> 01:16:44.065
-Dick.

01:16:46.301 --> 01:16:49.170
-Fuck, that wine is good.

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:54.575
Hey, look who's bringing
in the dishes.

01:16:54.577 --> 01:16:56.777
Very responsible.

01:16:56.779 --> 01:16:59.213
You know what?
-What?

01:16:59.215 --> 01:17:01.449
-I'm just making sure
you don't get in trouble, okay?

01:17:01.451 --> 01:17:03.918
-Uh-huh. This has nothing
to do with a certain someone

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:05.286
who happens to be on their way?

01:17:05.288 --> 01:17:07.989
-You have a bigger crush on will
than I do.

01:17:07.991 --> 01:17:09.457
I would think
you're more concerned

01:17:09.459 --> 01:17:10.791
about who's showing up.

01:17:10.793 --> 01:17:12.259
You're trying to save his ass
all night.

01:17:12.261 --> 01:17:14.695
I'm the whore?
You're the fucking whore.

01:17:14.697 --> 01:17:17.798
-This is about more
than just you and me.

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.967
-What is it about?
Football?

01:17:19.969 --> 01:17:24.005
Is it about your idol,
will Campbell?

01:17:24.007 --> 01:17:26.407
Coach?

01:17:26.409 --> 01:17:28.676
I seriously cannot wrap my head

01:17:28.678 --> 01:17:31.045
around why you still
believe in this guy.

01:17:31.047 --> 01:17:33.948
-You don't believe in him
anymore?

01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:36.250
-Okay. Let me just explain

01:17:36.252 --> 01:17:37.752
relationships to you.
-Oh, I would love this.

01:17:37.754 --> 01:17:39.120
-Because you probably never
had one.

01:17:39.122 --> 01:17:40.721
When you have a relationship
with someone,

01:17:40.723 --> 01:17:42.256
you share things, you go deep,

01:17:42.258 --> 01:17:45.126
you have feelings that don't get
washed away so easily!

01:17:45.128 --> 01:17:46.994
-And where does Sarah
fall in all this?

01:17:46.996 --> 01:17:50.231
-You just proved you have no
idea what you're talking about.

01:17:50.233 --> 01:17:52.533
You know,
she has her own secrets, too.

01:17:52.535 --> 01:17:53.768
She's not perfect.

01:17:53.770 --> 01:17:57.171
-Train wreck.

01:17:57.173 --> 01:17:59.073
-Excuse me?

01:17:59.075 --> 01:18:03.244
-I said
you're a fucking train wreck.

01:18:03.246 --> 01:18:04.845
-I'm a fucking train wreck?
-Yeah.

01:18:04.847 --> 01:18:06.580
-Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

01:18:06.582 --> 01:18:08.015
-You think life has to be
this --

01:18:08.017 --> 01:18:09.784
-who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?!

01:18:09.786 --> 01:18:10.851
You can say that to me?!
Look at you!

01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:12.253
You're empty inside!

01:18:12.255 --> 01:18:13.821
You haven't lived a day
in your fucking life

01:18:13.823 --> 01:18:15.122
until you met me!

01:18:15.124 --> 01:18:17.725
-You used me to get to will.

01:18:17.727 --> 01:18:19.393
And now you're gonna
bring him down with you.

01:18:19.395 --> 01:18:21.162
-Yeah, you got me pegged.

01:18:21.164 --> 01:18:23.164
You're so smart.

01:18:23.166 --> 01:18:25.733
-I think I do.

01:18:25.735 --> 01:18:27.601
-Enlighten me.

01:18:27.603 --> 01:18:32.773
-You're just
a scared little girl.

01:18:32.775 --> 01:18:35.176
That's it.

01:18:35.178 --> 01:18:36.277
-Mm-hmm.

01:18:36.279 --> 01:18:39.480
-What about a regular
relationship?

01:18:39.482 --> 01:18:43.284
It's too boring, right?

01:18:43.286 --> 01:18:45.286
Too mundane.

01:18:45.288 --> 01:18:46.554
Got to cry for help.

01:18:46.556 --> 01:18:48.589
Got to pull some shit
like last night, right?

01:18:48.591 --> 01:18:51.358
-Fuck you!

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:54.295
Let me ask you a question
since you're the better person

01:18:54.297 --> 01:18:57.031
here, right? Mr. morality.
-I didn't say that.

01:18:57.033 --> 01:18:59.433
-Let me ask you a question.
-Mm-hmm.

01:18:59.435 --> 01:19:01.435
-What would you have done
if I died last night?

01:19:01.437 --> 01:19:03.070
-Then you'd be dead.

01:19:03.072 --> 01:19:04.438
-You're not listening.

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.440
What would you have done?

01:19:06.442 --> 01:19:10.478
Would you have called 911
finally instead of wasting time

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:13.114
calling Pete,
calling this secret doctor,

01:19:13.116 --> 01:19:15.583
instead of calling someone who
could actually save my life?!

01:19:15.585 --> 01:19:17.418
You're a fucking coward!

01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:19.320
You're a piece of shit!

01:19:19.322 --> 01:19:24.358
I bet -- I bet if Peter
told you to drive by a hospital

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:26.961
and open up the door
and let me fucking tumble out,

01:19:26.963 --> 01:19:28.162
you would you have done it!

01:19:28.164 --> 01:19:29.563
And you want to know
why I know that?

01:19:29.565 --> 01:19:31.332
It's because you're a stupid,
little bitch,

01:19:31.334 --> 01:19:33.400
and you would do anything
they tell you to do

01:19:33.402 --> 01:19:35.770
'cause you don't have
a fucking brain of your own!

01:19:35.772 --> 01:19:38.172
Yeah, walk away.

01:19:38.174 --> 01:19:40.341
I'll tell them you said hi.

01:19:49.651 --> 01:19:52.119
-Call me a fucking bitch.

01:19:52.121 --> 01:19:54.722
You're a bitch.
Fucking bitch.

01:19:54.724 --> 01:19:58.159
Mort st-- fucking bitch.

01:20:06.368 --> 01:20:09.370
-Ow!

01:21:20.175 --> 01:21:24.612
-So, the bedroom is even cleaner
than we found it.

01:21:24.614 --> 01:21:29.917
There's no sign
of illicit love-making anywhere.

01:21:29.919 --> 01:21:33.187
-That's great.

01:21:44.065 --> 01:21:48.035
-And you're gonna be a big hero.

01:21:48.037 --> 01:21:51.405
Your career's gonna take off.

01:21:51.407 --> 01:21:54.341
Sky's the limit.

01:21:59.314 --> 01:22:02.483
-And you'll get will back.

01:22:07.756 --> 01:22:10.658
-Everybody wins.

01:22:55.603 --> 01:22:58.105
-Maddie.

01:23:04.579 --> 01:23:06.880
-Try one of those on.

01:23:06.882 --> 01:23:10.150
-I don't really, uh,
smoke that much.

01:23:10.152 --> 01:23:11.852
-You'll like it.

01:23:14.824 --> 01:23:17.491
Yeah, it's smooth.

01:23:20.996 --> 01:23:23.497
-You know, Kevin, you really
do look like a dog's asshole

01:23:23.499 --> 01:23:25.065
right now.

01:23:25.067 --> 01:23:27.568
-Yeah, well,
it's been a long night.

01:23:29.304 --> 01:23:33.207
-Trust me.
It won't go unappreciated.

01:23:33.942 --> 01:23:35.442
Will and I were talking.

01:23:35.444 --> 01:23:37.211
There might be a spot on
the coaching staff opening up

01:23:37.213 --> 01:23:40.347
that could have your name on it.

01:23:44.185 --> 01:23:45.719
-Coaching staff, huh?

01:23:45.721 --> 01:23:49.156
-Liked the way
you handled yourself.

01:23:53.828 --> 01:23:58.932
-What's gonna happen to her?

01:23:58.934 --> 01:24:02.269
-You look good.

01:24:02.271 --> 01:24:04.171
-You don't have to be here.

01:24:04.173 --> 01:24:06.073
I know you don't have time
for my bullshit.

01:24:06.075 --> 01:24:09.209
-Maddie, don't.
Don't say that.

01:24:09.211 --> 01:24:14.381
-Shouldn't you be with the team,
your family?

01:24:14.383 --> 01:24:16.750
-No.

01:24:16.752 --> 01:24:19.086
I should be right here with you.

01:24:19.088 --> 01:24:20.587
-Right.

01:24:20.589 --> 01:24:23.390
-I needed to see you.
-You're only saying this now

01:24:23.392 --> 01:24:24.625
'cause you don't want me to go
to the press.

01:24:24.627 --> 01:24:27.995
-That's not true.
You want the truth?

01:24:27.997 --> 01:24:29.063
You want the truth
about how I feel?

01:24:29.065 --> 01:24:30.297
-Yeah.
-I love you.

01:24:30.299 --> 01:24:33.500
I want you back in my life.

01:24:33.502 --> 01:24:36.236
I never wanted you
out of my life.

01:24:36.238 --> 01:24:37.771
But it's complicated.

01:24:37.773 --> 01:24:41.075
-It's complicated.
-Yeah, it's complicated.

01:24:41.077 --> 01:24:43.977
You know it is.
-It's complicated.

01:24:43.979 --> 01:24:48.549
-So I don't know
what to do here.

01:24:48.551 --> 01:24:50.717
First thing,
i want to make sure you're okay.

01:24:50.719 --> 01:24:54.021
-I'm fine.

01:24:54.023 --> 01:24:56.924
-I don't think you're fine.
-I'm the best I've ever been.

01:24:58.494 --> 01:25:01.061
-I love you,
and I have missed you.

01:25:01.063 --> 01:25:03.397
God, I missed you.

01:25:03.399 --> 01:25:04.798
-You don't miss me.

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:08.769
You miss late-night quickies
and room service.

01:25:08.771 --> 01:25:10.104
-Well, yeah.

01:25:12.641 --> 01:25:17.077
-Come on, maddie.

01:25:17.079 --> 01:25:19.580
It's more than that
and you know it.

01:25:22.217 --> 01:25:24.051
Will you look at me?

01:25:24.053 --> 01:25:26.253
-What?

01:25:28.156 --> 01:25:29.756
-Never mind.

01:25:29.758 --> 01:25:31.425
-What?

01:25:31.427 --> 01:25:33.427
-[ Chuckles lightly

01:25:33.429 --> 01:25:37.898
did you and Kevin...?

01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:39.299
Here in my house?

01:25:39.301 --> 01:25:42.102
-I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:25:42.104 --> 01:25:44.138
-Did he kiss you?

01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:45.672
-What? Are you jealous?

01:25:45.674 --> 01:25:48.542
-Yeah. I am.

01:25:48.544 --> 01:25:51.545
I'm jealous. How about that.

01:25:51.547 --> 01:25:53.013
-Good.
-Do you like that?

01:25:53.015 --> 01:25:54.248
-I like it a lot.
-Uh-huh.

01:25:54.250 --> 01:25:57.151
-It's different.
-Uh-huh.

01:25:57.153 --> 01:25:59.887
Hey.

01:26:03.658 --> 01:26:05.526
God, maddie,
when I got that call

01:26:05.528 --> 01:26:08.695
and I heard what happened,
i didn't know what to do.

01:26:10.632 --> 01:26:13.467
Hey, I don't want to lose you.

01:26:13.469 --> 01:26:16.036
I don't.
I don't want to lose you.

01:26:16.038 --> 01:26:18.772
I love you.

01:26:19.774 --> 01:26:21.909
-Trust me.
I don't like it, either.

01:26:21.911 --> 01:26:24.878
But if he wants to risk
having her around,

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:28.182
what can I do about it?

01:26:35.156 --> 01:26:37.257
-Kevin.

01:26:37.259 --> 01:26:40.494
Thank you for looking
after maddie last night.

01:26:42.397 --> 01:26:47.034
You all right?

01:26:47.036 --> 01:26:50.671
-I know about Kyle Walker.

01:26:50.673 --> 01:26:53.173
-Yeah,
he's a good football player.

01:26:53.175 --> 01:26:56.276
-How'd you get him to come here?

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:03.884
-What do you know?

01:27:03.886 --> 01:27:07.521
-You know, just the p's.

01:27:07.523 --> 01:27:08.589
-The p's.

01:27:08.591 --> 01:27:11.625
-Persistence, preparation...

01:27:11.627 --> 01:27:12.793
Payoffs.

01:27:12.795 --> 01:27:15.229
-Kevin, I wasn't done
talking to you.

01:27:15.231 --> 01:27:16.530
-It's okay, Pete.
-Yeah.

01:27:16.532 --> 01:27:19.366
I was done with you, though.

01:27:19.368 --> 01:27:21.101
-Okay, Kevin,
you're disappointed in me.

01:27:21.103 --> 01:27:22.736
I get it.

01:27:22.738 --> 01:27:26.139
But everything I've done
is for the sake of this program.

01:27:26.141 --> 01:27:27.708
And one day if you find yourself

01:27:27.710 --> 01:27:30.010
in a position like mine --
and I think you will --

01:27:30.012 --> 01:27:31.545
you're gonna find out
that making tough decisions

01:27:31.547 --> 01:27:34.114
is a big part of the job.

01:27:34.116 --> 01:27:36.550
Trust me when I tell you,

01:27:36.552 --> 01:27:39.720
these decisions are what got us
where we are today.

01:27:39.722 --> 01:27:44.358
-But I don't trust you, so...

01:27:46.961 --> 01:27:49.429
What are you doing?

01:27:50.465 --> 01:27:53.100
What are you doing?

01:27:53.102 --> 01:27:56.270
-Kevin, we appreciate you
taking care of her, all right?

01:27:58.841 --> 01:28:01.074
-Should have given those to you
hours ago.

01:28:01.076 --> 01:28:02.809
-Kevin, listen to me.

01:28:02.811 --> 01:28:04.711
Hey.

01:28:04.713 --> 01:28:06.813
Kevin.

01:28:06.815 --> 01:28:08.915
Think about your future!

01:28:11.854 --> 01:28:14.254
Just needs a little while
to cool down.

01:28:14.256 --> 01:28:16.623
-How do you know?

01:28:16.625 --> 01:28:18.425
-Maddie, you had to get
a good sense of this guy.

01:28:18.427 --> 01:28:21.194
He's upset now,
but he'll come around, right?

01:28:21.196 --> 01:28:25.332
-Yeah, will.

01:28:25.334 --> 01:28:28.468
Besides, you can talk anyone
into anything.

01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:33.340
-Yeah. It was a nice
fucking mess you got us in.

01:28:33.342 --> 01:28:35.208
-I'll go talk to him.

01:28:35.210 --> 01:28:36.443
-Would you?
-Yeah.

01:28:36.445 --> 01:28:38.011
-Just tell him to come back
in here.

01:28:38.013 --> 01:28:40.180
-Yeah, I'll -- I'll just fix it.

01:28:40.182 --> 01:28:42.883
-Thank you.

01:28:48.022 --> 01:28:50.691
All right.

01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:03.403
-Hey.

01:29:03.405 --> 01:29:06.373
-Hi.
-What are you doing?

01:29:06.375 --> 01:29:09.376
-I guess I'm changing
my five-year plan.

01:29:09.378 --> 01:29:11.545
-You want a ride?

01:29:11.547 --> 01:29:13.447
-What about will?

01:29:13.449 --> 01:29:17.050
-I hope he wins.

01:29:21.322 --> 01:29:24.591
Where to?
