<i>You probably already know
what happened.</i>

00:21.849 --> 00:23.057
<i>Then again, you might not.</i>

00:25.059 --> 00:26.578
<i>You might not even give a shit.</i>

00:27.993 --> 00:29.512
<i>But I'm gonna tell you anyway.</i>

00:31.169 --> 00:32.653
<i>We all went about
our daily lives,</i>

00:32.722 --> 00:34.758
<i>oblivious to how bad things
were in the world.</i>

00:36.450 --> 00:38.797
<i>And then they hit
the reset button,</i>

00:38.866 --> 00:42.283
<i>erasing all of their problems
along with hundreds of millions of lives.</i>

00:44.630 --> 00:46.046
<i>No one saw it coming.</i>

00:47.668 --> 00:48.841
<i>The end.</i>

00:58.541 --> 01:00.370
<i>The lucky ones
were dead in seconds.</i>

01:02.407 --> 01:03.925
<i>As for the rest of us,</i>

01:03.994 --> 01:06.411
<i>immune to the black poison,
we had to decide.</i>

01:08.240 --> 01:10.277
<i>Hang on to the civility
of the past,</i>

01:11.761 --> 01:15.144
<i>or become savages
in a new dark future.</i>

01:23.255 --> 01:27.259
<i>Hey, kids, this is 99.2 KILU...</i>

01:27.328 --> 01:31.505
<i>and you're listening to Crazy Al's
radio party, The Last Radio Show.</i>

01:31.574 --> 01:35.612
<i>Here's another safety update
for all you domestics out there,</i>

01:35.681 --> 01:37.649
<i>just trying to stay alive.</i>

01:37.718 --> 01:39.858
<i>If you're new to the area,
listen up,</i>

01:39.927 --> 01:42.447
<i>and I'll fill you in on all the shit
we've been dealing with</i>

01:42.516 --> 01:45.243
<i>here, in the
once beautiful Midwest.</i>

01:45.312 --> 01:48.901
<i>Still no word from the US government.
What a shocker.</i>

01:48.970 --> 01:52.042
<i>But I suppose when you make
the decision to crop dust your country</i>

01:52.112 --> 01:55.736
<i>with deadly chemicals,
there's really not much more to say.</i>

01:55.805 --> 01:59.498
<i>I guess that's what happens when
a democracy turns into a dictatorship.</i>

02:01.121 --> 02:03.157
<i>You thought
we had problems before?</i>

02:03.226 --> 02:06.333
<i>Debts, disease,
dwindling resources?</i>

02:06.402 --> 02:12.235
<i>Some barista put too much syrup in your
macchiato fucking Frappuccino?</i>

02:12.304 --> 02:14.237
<i>You know what I saw
the other day?</i>

02:14.306 --> 02:18.517
<i>A guy wearing a goddamn
deer head holding an AK-47.</i>

02:18.586 --> 02:22.556
<i>The crazy thing is, the son of a bitch
used to be my neighbor.</i>

02:22.625 --> 02:25.869
<i>This once great nation
on God's green earth</i>

02:25.938 --> 02:27.975
<i>no longer belongs to God.</i>

02:28.044 --> 02:30.150
<i>It belongs to the gangs.</i>

02:30.219 --> 02:31.944
<i>That's right, daddy-o,
the Midwest may have been</i>

02:32.013 --> 02:35.603
<i>the land of macaroni casserole,
fresh cut lawns and Schlitz beer,</i>

02:35.672 --> 02:39.573
<i>but we've got some of the worst
gangs in the country.</i>

02:39.642 --> 02:41.920
<i>Nailers, Plowboys,</i>

02:41.989 --> 02:44.785
<i>Gamblers, Cherries, Sheets,</i>

02:44.854 --> 02:46.373
<i>just to name a few.</i>

02:46.442 --> 02:47.788
<i>They're all bad news.</i>

02:47.857 --> 02:50.756
<i>So keep your eyes open,
your guns loaded,</i>

02:50.825 --> 02:54.588
<i>because in this world,
you shoot first, then run like hell.</i>

02:54.657 --> 02:56.452
<i>You dig?</i>

02:56.521 --> 02:58.937
<i>Well, that's enough of my bullshitting,
let's play some music.</i>

02:59.006 --> 03:02.043
<i>We're on day 902
of our weekend oldies marathon.</i>

03:02.112 --> 03:03.355
<i>You might be asking,</i>

03:03.424 --> 03:06.462
<i>"Crazy Al, is this not
the weekend anymore?"</i>

03:06.531 --> 03:08.602
<i>Well, honey,
I just don't give a fuck.</i>

03:08.671 --> 03:12.122
<i>With that said, here's Roosevelt Nettles
on the Chess label</i>

03:12.192 --> 03:13.986
<i>with Drifting Heart.</i>

03:18.198 --> 03:19.785
So you're really doing this.

03:19.854 --> 03:21.684
- Yep.
- Why?

03:21.753 --> 03:23.341
You got everything you need
right here.

03:23.410 --> 03:25.688
You think I don't know that?

03:25.757 --> 03:28.000
I know it's probably the stupidest
thing I've ever done.

03:28.069 --> 03:29.588
But I still love her.

03:29.657 --> 03:31.694
You see, this is why
I never got married.

03:31.763 --> 03:34.593
Look, Mark, I'm not gonna tell you
what to do,

03:34.662 --> 03:36.250
because I know you know
what's out there.

03:36.319 --> 03:38.010
You get one flat tire,
you're fucking dead.

03:42.014 --> 03:44.707
If you still feel this is the only
way to save your marriage,

03:44.776 --> 03:45.949
for the love of God,

03:47.019 --> 03:48.158
take a different car.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.678
I fixed it.

03:50.747 --> 03:52.301
- You fixed it?
- Yep.

03:52.370 --> 03:54.441
Uh, are we still talking about
the same car?

03:55.959 --> 03:57.064
I fixed it.

04:02.518 --> 04:06.280
<i>Crazy Al's radio party.
The music time machine...</i>

04:06.349 --> 04:08.144
<i>Hi, this is Crazy Al.</i>

04:08.213 --> 04:10.940
<i>It looks like it's gonna be
another shitty-ass day, daddy-o.</i>

04:11.009 --> 04:13.253
<i>Thanks for tuning
into KILU radio.</i>

04:13.322 --> 04:15.669
<i>No requests, no dedications,</i>

04:15.738 --> 04:18.464
<i>just a kick ass soundtrack
to your new way of life.</i>

04:18.534 --> 04:21.468
<i>Stay off the freeways
and watch out for those snipers.</i>

04:21.536 --> 04:24.194
<i>And if you see someone
dressed like a ghost,</i>

04:24.264 --> 04:27.612
<i>shoot that motherfucker because Sheets
ain't trick-or-treating.</i>

04:27.681 --> 04:30.822
<i>As that great philosopher
Baba-Oom-Mow-Mow once said</i>

04:30.891 --> 04:35.620
<i>"Doo-wop unto others
as you would have them doo-wop unto you."</i>

04:46.803 --> 04:48.564
Come on, let's make this quick.

04:48.633 --> 04:50.531
Those fuckers
are still out there.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.534
Fuck the Sheets. Fucking pussies.

04:53.603 --> 04:56.088
Those fucking pussies
just kicked our asses.

04:56.157 --> 04:57.952
Come on, let's eat some beans
and get the fuck outta here.

04:58.021 --> 04:59.540
We still got that town
up the road.

05:20.734 --> 05:21.942
Open the door.

06:07.401 --> 06:08.368
Hold down the gas.

06:22.623 --> 06:23.797
You guys want any salt and pepper?

06:35.015 --> 06:37.535
Come one.

06:59.833 --> 07:02.663
<i>Here's another safety update
for all you domestics out there</i>

07:02.732 --> 07:05.183
<i>braving the barren countryside.</i>

07:05.252 --> 07:09.083
<i>It's official that Sheets and Nailers
are in a turf war.</i>

07:09.152 --> 07:11.983
<i>I know you fuckers
can hear me out there.</i>

07:12.052 --> 07:14.572
<i>So do us all a favor
and just kill each other</i>

07:14.641 --> 07:16.436
<i>so we can get on
with our lives.</i>

07:16.505 --> 07:19.197
<i>With that said,
it's time to get safe.</i>

07:19.266 --> 07:21.855
<i>Pull off the roads,
find some shelter,</i>

07:21.924 --> 07:24.409
<i>because the sun is going down.</i>

07:24.478 --> 07:27.654
<i>thirty-five past the hour and you're listening
to Crazy Al's radio party...</i>

07:27.723 --> 07:29.172
We should stay off the roads.

07:29.241 --> 07:30.829
Crash here for the night.

07:30.898 --> 07:31.968
Do you think it's safe?

07:33.522 --> 07:34.592
We'll find out.

09:06.407 --> 09:07.581
This will never be us,
I promise.

09:21.491 --> 09:23.839
Miss Milwaukee,
this is Eagle. Over.

09:27.636 --> 09:29.361
Miss Milwaukee,
this is Eagle. Over.

09:35.436 --> 09:36.541
Mom?

09:41.339 --> 09:42.409
Okay.

09:44.514 --> 09:46.378
I just wanted to let you know
that we're on our way.

09:51.970 --> 09:53.489
<i>I wish I could hear your voice.</i>

09:56.872 --> 09:59.253
<i>I know Mark wants
to fix things between us.</i>

10:02.602 --> 10:06.226
<i>I just don't know how.
We've been broken for too long.</i>

10:13.543 --> 10:15.338
<i>I wish you could tell me
everything's going to be all right.</i>

10:18.548 --> 10:19.515
I miss you.

11:00.349 --> 11:02.420
You remember when we used to complain
about the Milwaukee drive?

11:04.525 --> 11:05.630
Five hours.

11:06.873 --> 11:08.184
Seems like nothing now.

11:12.257 --> 11:14.432
You think I'll be able to, uh...

11:14.501 --> 11:16.089
To get your dad to give me
his gun this time?

11:19.023 --> 11:20.576
The one you always steal
from his safe?

11:20.645 --> 11:21.991
Mmm. The Wildey Magnum?
Yeah.

11:23.027 --> 11:24.131
I doubt it.

11:25.477 --> 11:26.616
He doesn't like you.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.412
No, he does not.

11:31.449 --> 11:34.107
I'm actually pretty sure
the last thing he said to me was

11:34.176 --> 11:36.661
"Get your shit together,
you clown."

11:36.730 --> 11:37.766
It was nice.

11:39.353 --> 11:40.700
That sounds about right.

12:06.484 --> 12:07.692
Good night, Markus.

12:26.366 --> 12:28.126
<i>All right, kids,
it's 20 past the hour</i>

12:28.195 --> 12:31.164
<i>and this is Crazy Al,
bringing you words of wisdom</i>

12:31.233 --> 12:33.407
<i>and a whole lot of good
goddamn music, too.</i>

12:33.476 --> 12:36.617
<i>Hey, we are on day 903 of our
weekend oldies marathon.</i>

12:36.686 --> 12:39.551
<i>With that said,
here's a sleepy little tune.</i>

12:39.620 --> 12:42.002
<i>Denny Reed on the Trey label.</i>

12:42.071 --> 12:44.625
<i>It's called No One Cares.</i>

12:52.323 --> 12:53.634
Where you headed?

12:55.153 --> 12:56.568
You guys and your scary masks.

12:59.675 --> 13:00.814
Argh!

13:03.196 --> 13:05.094
No, stop. Please.

13:06.406 --> 13:08.132
Stop! Stop! Stop, please!

13:08.201 --> 13:09.512
Please don't do it.

13:13.171 --> 13:16.071
My guys are tired. Angry.

13:16.140 --> 13:20.454
They need a little morale boost.
Understand?

13:20.523 --> 13:23.768
Now if you happened to know
where we could find a woman's touch...

13:23.837 --> 13:27.530
- No.
- ...we'd greatly appreciate it.

13:27.599 --> 13:30.879
I wouldn't want these animals
to have to go to town on your friend here.

13:32.328 --> 13:33.571
Not their preference.

13:35.262 --> 13:37.747
We're the same, you and I.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.992
You do this for me,
I'd personally see to it that you live.

13:42.166 --> 13:45.203
Join the Nailers
and own the fucking world.

13:46.066 --> 13:47.757
I'm nothing like you.

13:59.769 --> 14:01.047
Fuck it! Come on.

14:08.986 --> 14:11.851
Wait, please, please.
Listen, I saw someone.

14:14.163 --> 14:17.857
A girl. A girl and a guy,
up Shadow Brook Road.

14:17.926 --> 14:19.582
This house
had Christmas lights.

14:19.651 --> 14:23.276
Did it have a manger?
You know, the baby Jesus thing?

14:24.518 --> 14:26.003
Yeah, we hit that shit up
the other day.

14:26.072 --> 14:28.937
No. No. This was last night.

14:29.006 --> 14:30.007
You just let them go?

14:32.492 --> 14:33.700
They seemed, uh...

14:35.909 --> 14:36.945
They seemed nice.

14:44.366 --> 14:45.539
What about this one?

15:05.318 --> 15:06.250
Fuck!

15:09.322 --> 15:10.116
Fuck him.

15:55.506 --> 15:56.817
I don't want to die here.

15:58.750 --> 15:59.889
We're not.

16:00.821 --> 16:01.961
We are not.

16:15.215 --> 16:16.734
I want to go home.

16:16.803 --> 16:20.151
Hey, we are, okay? We are.
I'm going to take you home, okay?

16:20.220 --> 16:22.015
It's going to be okay,
all right?

16:26.916 --> 16:29.333
Look at me.
Hey, it's going to be fine.

16:29.402 --> 16:30.368
Say it for me.

16:32.474 --> 16:33.578
Come on, say it.

16:35.442 --> 16:36.512
Be careful.

19:16.741 --> 19:18.398
Miss Milwaukee,
this is Eagle. Over.

19:20.504 --> 19:22.471
Miss Milwaukee,
this is Eagle. Over.

19:25.785 --> 19:26.820
Mom?

19:46.944 --> 19:48.739
<i>Here's another safety update</i>

19:48.808 --> 19:50.603
<i>for all you domestics
out there.</i>

19:50.672 --> 19:53.606
<i>Word on the street is
there's a renegade Cherry</i>

19:53.675 --> 19:56.367
<i>saving women and killing
anyone in her way.</i>

19:56.436 --> 19:59.439
<i>Look out, boys,
she's a fucking psycho!</i>

19:59.508 --> 20:02.580
<i>There's also a lone wolf
roaming the countryside,</i>

20:02.649 --> 20:05.204
<i>who likes to get kinky
with a straight razor.</i>

20:05.273 --> 20:07.758
<i>I mean, come on!
Who comes up with this shit?</i>

20:07.827 --> 20:10.726
<i>Is the world really this crazy?
Of course it is,</i>

20:10.795 --> 20:13.315
<i>or my name isn't Crazy Al!</i>

20:42.102 --> 20:44.381
Hold it.

20:44.450 --> 20:47.349
Drop the basket and put the gun
on the ground. Slow.

20:51.767 --> 20:53.597
Don't try anything.
I'm not alone.

20:56.910 --> 20:57.946
Fuck.

21:00.673 --> 21:03.607
Just take whatever you want, okay?
Just let us go.

21:03.676 --> 21:04.849
All I'm looking for...

21:15.274 --> 21:17.862
Is a handshake, friend.

21:30.116 --> 21:31.290
Here.

21:33.084 --> 21:34.223
Take it.

21:38.987 --> 21:40.057
Nathan Wood.

21:42.715 --> 21:45.062
Mark West.

21:45.131 --> 21:47.271
Pleasure to finally meet you.
And, uh...

21:48.583 --> 21:50.688
Nina Monroe.

21:53.070 --> 21:56.004
Sorry for the theatrics,
but you know how it is.

21:56.073 --> 21:57.557
Been a while since
we've seen folks like you.

21:58.765 --> 22:00.595
- We?
- I've been watching you.

22:03.460 --> 22:07.153
Wait. Sorry.
That came out wrong. Listen.

22:07.222 --> 22:10.536
We are the same.
We want the same things.

22:10.605 --> 22:13.608
As a matter of fact, uh...
Well, I know this sounds crazy,

22:13.677 --> 22:15.334
but I was wondering...

22:16.058 --> 22:17.059
Shit. Go.

22:27.380 --> 22:30.349
If you find the blond,
don't mess up her face.

22:32.627 --> 22:34.145
Listen up.

22:34.214 --> 22:36.458
My wife and I would like
to invite you both over for dinner.

22:37.873 --> 22:39.806
- What?
- Uh, sorry, late lunch.

22:41.014 --> 22:42.809
That's Theresa.

22:42.878 --> 22:44.673
You don't have to dress up
or anything.

22:44.742 --> 22:46.813
The girls can open a bottle of wine,
I'll make cocktails,

22:46.882 --> 22:48.021
and you can meet my kids.

22:54.821 --> 22:57.445
The fuck was that?

22:57.514 --> 22:59.826
My son, Steven. All clear?

23:02.864 --> 23:03.934
Clear.

23:08.352 --> 23:11.010
My dad had one of these.
He liked it.

23:12.114 --> 23:14.013
- Yours '81?
- It's '82.

23:14.082 --> 23:18.224
Four wheel drive standard.
Yours five speed?

23:18.293 --> 23:20.640
It's, uh, converted
to automatic, actually.

23:20.709 --> 23:24.403
That faux wood on navy.

23:24.472 --> 23:25.645
Man, it was a different era.

23:26.819 --> 23:28.165
It's running rich.

23:28.234 --> 23:30.167
My guess is the float level
in the carb is off,

23:30.236 --> 23:31.617
but just been messing with it.

23:32.756 --> 23:34.585
Well, my offer still stands.

23:34.654 --> 23:37.623
You can talk it over if you like.
But if you did happen to come,

23:37.692 --> 23:40.488
I might just have an original
service manual for an '81 Eagle.

23:40.557 --> 23:42.179
Bullshit.

23:42.248 --> 23:44.837
My old man's. It'll definitely have
the float level specs.

23:44.906 --> 23:47.529
- You into cars?
- Nah.

23:47.598 --> 23:48.599
I like guns.

23:51.464 --> 23:52.500
You know, uh...

23:55.054 --> 23:57.332
It would mean the world to my wife
and to me, if you would join us.

23:58.402 --> 24:00.956
Oh. We really should get going.

24:01.647 --> 24:02.682
I understand.

24:04.753 --> 24:07.929
I just can't help but think
that we met for a reason.

24:07.998 --> 24:11.001
People like us don't just cross paths,
not out here. And seeing you two

24:13.348 --> 24:14.487
gave me hope.

24:17.904 --> 24:20.804
And I might add that Theresa

24:20.873 --> 24:23.496
makes the best goddamned
green bean casserole you'll ever have.

24:32.229 --> 24:35.094
I guess, if it's on the way.

24:35.163 --> 24:38.269
Well, now that's the spirit!

24:38.338 --> 24:40.893
Steven, let's get this beautiful car
hooked up to the rig.

24:40.962 --> 24:42.826
It'll be safer for us
to ride in the truck.

24:42.895 --> 24:44.621
Pull her around back,
I'll go get the truck ready.

24:57.288 --> 24:59.463
I can't wait for you
to meet Theresa.

24:59.532 --> 25:01.085
I think you girls
will really hit it off.

25:09.438 --> 25:11.233
Shit! Plowboys.

25:13.132 --> 25:14.202
Just sit tight.

25:24.592 --> 25:25.593
Jim.

25:26.559 --> 25:27.629
How's the family?

25:28.319 --> 25:30.011
Safe. Yours?

25:31.219 --> 25:32.289
Steadfast.

25:35.119 --> 25:36.431
So what are you boys
doing out here?

25:39.848 --> 25:43.300
Just patrolling the neighborhood.
Hunting for Gamblers.

25:43.369 --> 25:45.751
You know they stole
nine of my girls?

25:45.820 --> 25:48.581
Fucking freaks! Probably using them
to make babies.

25:50.687 --> 25:53.862
You have some fresh faces
with you.

25:55.381 --> 25:56.865
They're friends.

25:56.934 --> 25:58.764
Couldn't help but notice
the merchandise.

26:02.146 --> 26:04.804
K-98. Where'd you get it?

26:06.116 --> 26:07.600
You see the cooch in the truck?

26:08.843 --> 26:09.982
I call her Betsy.

26:10.672 --> 26:12.778
Is she a Cherry?

26:12.847 --> 26:14.676
- What's she doing down here?
- I don't know.

26:15.263 --> 26:17.403
Deserter, maybe?

26:17.472 --> 26:20.130
Didn't see any more of those
man-hating bitches, so,

26:21.131 --> 26:22.339
I assumed she's alone.

26:23.374 --> 26:26.308
She will turn a pretty penny.

26:26.377 --> 26:28.000
Just relax, sugar pop.

26:31.624 --> 26:37.112
I even injected her with one of those
animal tracking devices.

26:37.181 --> 26:39.183
Just like old Ginger.

26:40.012 --> 26:41.565
This one ain't getting away.

26:41.634 --> 26:43.532
She's a wild one, too.

26:43.602 --> 26:47.709
She bit Bruce's finger clean off
when we caught her. Oh, yeah.

26:49.262 --> 26:51.540
I am going to test drive
her tonight.

26:54.095 --> 26:59.203
So, who is the cha-cha
in the truck?

27:02.310 --> 27:04.657
Don't worry.
Plowboys are pussies.

27:07.177 --> 27:08.903
Don't tell my dad
I said "pussies."

27:15.219 --> 27:18.809
I would really appreciate it

27:18.878 --> 27:20.811
if you would move your plow.

27:22.019 --> 27:23.158
Gonna be late for dinner.

27:25.126 --> 27:26.334
What if I don't?

27:49.909 --> 27:51.462
Give my best to Theresa.

27:52.049 --> 27:53.085
Will do.

28:15.245 --> 28:16.867
I really appreciate
you guys doing this.

28:40.442 --> 28:41.478
As promised.

28:41.547 --> 28:42.790
Oh, my God.

28:43.583 --> 28:46.345
Wow, thank you.

28:46.414 --> 28:50.729
So obviously, you wanna stay off
I-94 and Highway 10.

28:50.798 --> 28:53.214
If the snipers don't get you, the gangs
will spot you from the radio towers.

28:53.283 --> 28:55.803
- Mmm-hmm.
- You came from Two Harbors?

28:55.872 --> 28:57.839
- Yeah, yeah.
- Quaint.

28:58.806 --> 28:59.945
Why did you leave?

29:01.809 --> 29:04.259
Nina wanted to be
with her folks,

29:04.328 --> 29:07.297
so we're making the trek
to Beer Town.

29:08.160 --> 29:09.575
You having second thoughts?

29:11.922 --> 29:13.579
No. No. It's, um...

29:17.307 --> 29:19.481
They, uh... They don't know
that we're coming.

29:21.414 --> 29:23.727
They used to speak over the CB
about every day,

29:25.660 --> 29:27.835
and we haven't heard from them
in a couple of weeks.

29:29.698 --> 29:30.907
You think something happened?

29:35.774 --> 29:39.053
Can't really say that to her
though, can I?

29:39.122 --> 29:41.193
- <i>Dinner's ready!</i>
- Come on.

29:46.232 --> 29:48.545
- Oh, no, I couldn't...
- I don't believe you.

29:48.614 --> 29:50.409
Thank you.

29:58.417 --> 30:01.178
Oh. Sorry, generator.

30:04.009 --> 30:05.355
So what did you do, Nina?

30:06.597 --> 30:08.945
Out there, before.

30:09.014 --> 30:13.087
I worked in a design firm,
in downtown Minneapolis.

30:14.951 --> 30:15.952
And Mark?

30:17.505 --> 30:19.990
Uh, I was in-between jobs.

30:20.059 --> 30:23.373
You know, did some handyman stuff,
construction.

30:23.442 --> 30:26.445
Mark was trying to get
his contractor's license.

30:26.514 --> 30:28.861
I wasn't trying to get,
I was getting it, um...

30:28.930 --> 30:31.243
- That's what I meant.
- Right.

30:37.111 --> 30:39.320
So, Nina, bringing home
the bacon. That's neat.

30:41.011 --> 30:43.255
Bet you took advantage
of that, Mark.

30:43.324 --> 30:44.912
Fishing, drinking beer,
golfing.

30:46.051 --> 30:48.053
Hell, I would have.

30:48.122 --> 30:49.813
<i>For all you lovebirds out there
brazen the barren countryside.</i>

30:49.882 --> 30:54.335
<i>On the Caprice label,
it's called Till by The Angels.</i>

30:54.404 --> 30:55.784
Oh, hon?

30:57.717 --> 30:59.029
Come on, now.

31:00.893 --> 31:02.619
So sorry, our song.

31:04.552 --> 31:09.039
<b> <i>♪ Till then I'll worship you ♪</i> </b>

31:10.696 --> 31:16.288
<b> <i>♪ Till the tropic sun
Turns cold ♪</i> </b>

31:16.357 --> 31:20.361
<b> <i>♪ Till this young world

31:20.430 --> 31:25.366

31:26.781 --> 31:33.305

<b> <i>♪ Till lovers cease to dream ♪</i> </b>

31:51.323 --> 31:53.083
Gross.

31:53.152 --> 31:55.396
Okay. Okay, we have guests.

31:59.952 --> 32:01.298
Sorry, I get carried away.

32:02.506 --> 32:05.544
Man, Crazy Al.

32:05.613 --> 32:08.374
World may have went to shit,
but damn, did radio get better, huh.

32:08.443 --> 32:10.066
- Language.
- Sorry, hon.

32:11.446 --> 32:12.689
You like this music?

32:14.449 --> 32:15.968
It's okay.

32:16.037 --> 32:19.523
So you're a designer.
No artist gangs for you to join?

32:19.592 --> 32:22.492
Theresa.

32:22.561 --> 32:27.393
No, I... I used to work in the office,
handling monetary things.

32:27.462 --> 32:29.085
Budgets, contract negotiations.

32:32.157 --> 32:33.744
I don't think they have
a gang for that.

32:35.470 --> 32:37.956
- The Gamblers.
- The Gamblers?

32:38.025 --> 32:41.994
I saw this Gambler once,
he was wearing a buffalo head.

32:42.063 --> 32:44.893
Hey. You should tell Mark
about the Bobbies.

32:46.792 --> 32:49.001
- The Bobbies?
- I found this Nailer

32:49.070 --> 32:51.452
with my dad once
on the side of the road.

32:51.521 --> 32:54.110
He was stabbed
all over his body.

32:54.179 --> 32:56.146
Blood was everywhere.

32:56.215 --> 32:57.837
All his cuts
were below his chest,

32:57.906 --> 33:00.116
like, whatever was stabbing
at him was short.

33:01.807 --> 33:02.877
Like Bella.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.225
We're thinking they're kids.

33:08.779 --> 33:10.367
Little stabbers.

33:10.436 --> 33:12.059
Hey, Bella. How about
you show me your room?

33:13.784 --> 33:15.062
Sure.

33:15.131 --> 33:16.097
Let's go.

33:19.618 --> 33:20.999
Mark and I will wash up.

33:26.935 --> 33:30.491
You guys seem really happy.

33:30.560 --> 33:32.976
We are.
Nathan is amazing.

33:34.874 --> 33:36.152
What about you and Mark?

33:38.775 --> 33:42.641
Come on. Don't pretend I didn't see
that little thing at dinner.

33:42.710 --> 33:44.815
It's complicated.

33:46.472 --> 33:47.577
Try me.

33:50.304 --> 33:53.893
We were going through
a divorce when

33:55.171 --> 33:56.517
everything happened.

33:58.864 --> 34:00.486
You're still wearing your ring,
I see.

34:02.005 --> 34:03.662
It feels weird to take it off.

34:08.080 --> 34:10.186
In the beginning,
things were different.

34:12.636 --> 34:18.125
He would sneak into my office and leave
sweet notes all over the place for me to find.

34:19.297 --> 34:20.851
We were crazy
about each other.

34:24.234 --> 34:25.511
But then life got hard.

34:27.478 --> 34:31.206
All we did was fight.
It broke my heart.

34:37.833 --> 34:39.110
And then the world changed.

34:41.527 --> 34:44.012
Happiness isn't
out there, Nina.

34:45.668 --> 34:46.808
Not anymore.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.570
It's in front of you.

34:55.161 --> 34:56.922
We need more wine.

34:56.991 --> 34:59.752
Yes.

34:59.821 --> 35:01.099
Dinner was amazing,
by the way.

35:02.893 --> 35:04.274
That's all Theresa.

35:05.724 --> 35:08.175
Those, uh, hamburger steaks
that we had tonight,

35:10.177 --> 35:12.524
do you think you'd be willing
to do some trading?

35:14.284 --> 35:16.321
Dry foods have been getting
a little bit old,

35:16.390 --> 35:19.462
and I've got bullets,
tools, gas.

35:21.429 --> 35:22.913
How about if I just
give you some?

35:24.225 --> 35:25.433
If you can guess what it is.

35:27.125 --> 35:30.404
Um... beef?

35:30.473 --> 35:32.130
Now when was the last time
you saw a cow?

35:33.786 --> 35:36.996
That's a good point. Um...
Uh, Venison?

35:38.929 --> 35:43.279
Mark, when was the last time
you saw a cow, a deer, a dog, bird?

35:43.348 --> 35:45.177
Hell, they all died out
before we started to.

35:46.937 --> 35:50.424
It was...
It was meat, right?

35:50.493 --> 35:54.807
I mean, it wasn't a veggie burger
or a bean patty,

35:54.876 --> 35:57.085
or, I don't know,
some vegan shit.

36:08.752 --> 36:09.995
No.

36:12.687 --> 36:13.826
No.

36:13.895 --> 36:15.725
Not bad, right?

36:15.794 --> 36:18.176
I mean, a little gamey,
but tender.

36:24.389 --> 36:25.424
You okay?

36:27.875 --> 36:29.256
I ate a fucking person?

36:29.325 --> 36:31.637
- We all did.
- Jesus Christ.

36:31.706 --> 36:33.294
Come on, Mark.

36:33.363 --> 36:35.089
The Darwin Awards, we made it.

36:36.470 --> 36:39.645
We didn't drink the government
Kool-Aid.

36:39.714 --> 36:43.615
We escaped the race wars, toxins didn't
do jack shit to our immune systems.

36:43.684 --> 36:46.238
When they hit the reset button
and we said fuck you.

36:46.307 --> 36:48.689
Now I think that allows us
a little freedom.

36:48.758 --> 36:51.933
Good people didn't survive, Mark.

36:53.003 --> 36:54.246
We did.

36:54.315 --> 36:55.868
If you tell Nina what we ate,
I will kill you.

36:57.560 --> 36:59.147
Keeping secrets from your wife?

37:01.288 --> 37:03.048
Not the healthiest choice
in a marriage.

37:03.117 --> 37:04.981
- I assume you tell your wife everything.
- I do.

37:05.050 --> 37:06.879
Then you're a fucking liar.
We're leaving. Nina!

37:06.948 --> 37:08.571
Whoa. Wait, calm down.
Now, listen.

37:10.469 --> 37:13.023
Let me tell you
what's gonna happen.

37:13.092 --> 37:16.579
You and Nina will stay
and continue to have a wonderful time.

37:16.648 --> 37:19.340
And if you don't,

37:22.170 --> 37:25.760
I will bleed you both out
like pigs,

37:25.829 --> 37:28.591
and feed you to my wife
and children. You understand?

37:31.490 --> 37:32.560
Or maybe just you?

37:34.113 --> 37:36.771
Seems to me Nina
would be better off.

37:36.840 --> 37:39.187
One a day,
keeps the blues away.

37:46.264 --> 37:47.265
Is everything all right here?

37:49.301 --> 37:51.441
I was just about to mix up
a couple of cocktails for Mark and me.

37:52.270 --> 37:53.547
You ladies want one?

37:53.616 --> 37:54.858
I make a killer Old Fashioned.

37:58.068 --> 37:59.207
I'm okay.

38:01.106 --> 38:02.245
Yeah, I'm good.

38:04.178 --> 38:05.835
So who wants
to play a board game?

38:05.904 --> 38:07.595
How about Monopoly?

38:08.389 --> 38:09.356
Bella!

38:10.288 --> 38:11.841
Bella! Bella!

38:11.910 --> 38:13.118
Oh, my God!

38:20.643 --> 38:23.335
Didn't expect to see me again,
did you?

38:25.924 --> 38:27.166
Should've finished the job.

38:28.271 --> 38:29.548
It's okay.

38:31.619 --> 38:33.828
Mommy's here.
You're gonna be okay, baby.

38:33.897 --> 38:36.141
Please don't hurt her.
Now, what do you want? Anything.

38:36.210 --> 38:38.661
Just don't hurt my...

38:43.493 --> 38:44.425
Him.

38:46.393 --> 38:47.428
And her.

38:52.053 --> 38:53.227
They're yours.

38:54.711 --> 38:56.575
Just give me my daughter.

38:58.715 --> 38:59.820
Daddy.

38:59.889 --> 39:01.200
It's okay. Mommy's here.

39:04.618 --> 39:07.828
Do what you gotta do.
Just give me my daughter back.

39:09.968 --> 39:11.521
Just give me my daughter back.

39:11.590 --> 39:12.488
Okay.

39:15.076 --> 39:16.146
Go!

39:21.186 --> 39:22.256
Theresa!

39:25.811 --> 39:27.986
Shit. Grab your stuff.
Grab your stuff.

39:47.937 --> 39:49.283
- What about Bella?
- We gotta go.

40:01.744 --> 40:04.022
You okay? Are you hurt?

40:04.885 --> 40:05.886
Nina?

40:08.026 --> 40:09.303
I can't do this anymore.

40:10.304 --> 40:11.616
What? Do what?

40:11.685 --> 40:13.756
Play this delusional game
of survival with you.

40:19.658 --> 40:23.006
Delusional? You wanna talk
about delusional?

40:23.075 --> 40:25.112
Who are you talking to
on that radio, Nina?

40:32.637 --> 40:34.949
I want to get home
to my parents.

40:35.018 --> 40:36.123
You know what?
That's your problem.

40:39.229 --> 40:41.024
If you had just played along
in any of this

40:41.093 --> 40:44.096
instead of running home
to Mommy and Daddy,

40:44.165 --> 40:46.478
you would have realized,
you know what, it's not that bad.

40:46.547 --> 40:47.445
Not that bad?

40:49.205 --> 40:50.586
Look around!

40:50.655 --> 40:51.656
Shit, Nina!

40:56.005 --> 40:56.971
Stay with me.

41:01.148 --> 41:03.253
Just stay with me,
stay with me. Nina. Nina!

41:03.737 --> 41:05.083
Fuck!

41:05.152 --> 41:07.292
Goddamn it! Shit!

41:23.204 --> 41:25.448
Jim, you copy? Over.

41:27.174 --> 41:28.382
Jim, you copy?

41:31.178 --> 41:32.869
Nathan. How's dinner?

41:33.801 --> 41:35.285
Theresa and Bella are dead.

41:37.115 --> 41:38.392
Oh, shit.

41:39.669 --> 41:41.153
What happened?

41:41.222 --> 41:44.053
You remember those friends of
mine I introduced you to today?

41:45.088 --> 41:46.296
How could I forget?

41:48.436 --> 41:50.508
What if I told you,
you could have the girl?

41:55.133 --> 41:56.134
Hell, yeah.

42:13.358 --> 42:15.084
Shit on a fucking shingle.

42:49.670 --> 42:50.671
Oh, my God!

42:52.984 --> 42:55.469
She's a Cherry.
I think she's a Cherry.

42:55.538 --> 42:56.643
Can we go?

44:29.597 --> 44:31.289
<i>Hi, this is Crazy Al</i>

44:31.358 --> 44:33.843
<i>with another safety update
for all you domestics out there.</i>

44:33.912 --> 44:38.779
<i>Gambler territory is now spreading
like a fucking cancer,</i>

44:38.848 --> 44:41.817
<i>so keep your loved ones close,
stay indoors,</i>

44:41.886 --> 44:45.648

catch you and spin that wheel of death,</i>

44:45.717 --> 44:49.341
<i>chances are they're gonna
send you straight to hell!<i></i></i>

44:49.410 --> 44:54.761
Now, here's Rickie Paige and her
never released 1959 track, Forever.

44:54.830 --> 44:57.142

46:44.836 --> 46:47.287
Now where do I get one of those?
Right there!

46:47.356 --> 46:51.429
It would be such a shame to splatter
your brains before all the fun and games.

46:54.915 --> 46:57.228
Will you kindly place that gun
on the ottoman there?

46:58.712 --> 46:59.782
Mmm-hmm.

47:02.612 --> 47:03.648
You can do it.

47:18.145 --> 47:19.284
So handsome.

47:24.945 --> 47:26.878
<i>Let me out of here!</i>

47:26.947 --> 47:29.225
<i>Let me out
of the fucking truck!</i>

47:30.295 --> 47:31.779
<i>Let me out of here.</i>

47:31.849 --> 47:33.851
<i>Let me out of here, you...</i>

47:51.247 --> 47:53.491
Is that all you got?

47:56.943 --> 47:58.634
Fuck!

48:12.855 --> 48:14.857
You know these two poor souls?

48:15.927 --> 48:17.239
Yes.

48:17.308 --> 48:20.345
Seems that they were
following you. Why?

48:21.036 --> 48:22.347
Why what?

48:22.416 --> 48:23.659
Why were they following you?

48:30.114 --> 48:31.253
Why were you following me?

48:33.324 --> 48:35.774
Allow me to introduce myself.

48:36.948 --> 48:40.779
My name is William Cunningham,

48:40.848 --> 48:44.680
but you, my new friend, have the
divine pleasure of calling me Willy.

48:45.474 --> 48:46.682
Oh, that's fantastic.

48:46.751 --> 48:48.926
There are two things
that Willy loves.

48:50.306 --> 48:54.276
A show, and a bit
of the ultra-violence.

48:54.345 --> 48:58.487
That's very original.

48:58.556 --> 49:01.904
- You know it?
- It was my favorite film when I was 17.

49:02.801 --> 49:03.941
Not anymore?

49:07.392 --> 49:08.497
A shame.

49:10.326 --> 49:14.158
Surprised me though. You're the first person
to ever call me out on it.

49:14.227 --> 49:17.402
These fucking simpletons
out here are clueless

49:17.471 --> 49:19.404
when it comes
to classic cinema.

49:19.473 --> 49:22.787
Could you believe this one,
he'd never even heard of <i>Eyes Without a Face.</i>

49:23.374 --> 49:24.547
But, uh...

49:25.755 --> 49:27.550
I was getting ready to...

49:29.725 --> 49:32.900
...teach him all about it.

49:32.970 --> 49:34.902
What do you want?

49:34.972 --> 49:41.116
Ooh! Ah! A man who likes to get
right down to the nitty-gritty.

49:41.185 --> 49:42.703
I like it.

49:42.772 --> 49:44.153
I'm pretty tired, man.
Can you just get to the fucking point?

49:49.676 --> 49:51.195
Meet Bill.

49:53.300 --> 49:56.303
I, uh, call him "The Big."

49:59.548 --> 50:03.931
Now, you and The Big...
Come on, Big.

50:05.795 --> 50:09.937
You're gonna get to know
each other a little bit.

50:10.007 --> 50:14.252
Unless, of course, you wanna finish the job
that I started on these two poor bastards,

50:14.321 --> 50:16.634
with me watching, of course.

50:16.703 --> 50:20.120
That allows you to leave
with your findings and your good looks.

50:23.813 --> 50:25.022
What do you say?

50:26.644 --> 50:27.852
You wanna go Big...

50:29.923 --> 50:31.235
...or you wanna go home?

52:33.150 --> 52:34.944
This is fucking bullshit.

52:49.718 --> 52:52.445
Now that's freedom.
Feel it in your fucking veins.

53:02.489 --> 53:04.353
Argh!

53:25.236 --> 53:26.893
Feel the electricity.

53:26.962 --> 53:28.895
Come on, explore the fear.

53:28.964 --> 53:32.830
That's right, experience life,
you motherfucking cocksuckers.

54:19.325 --> 54:20.705
<i>Goddamn it!</i>

54:25.262 --> 54:28.023
<i>Fucking cow!</i>

54:50.839 --> 54:52.289
You're different
than the rest of us.

54:54.118 --> 54:55.775
Make sure she understands that.

55:18.176 --> 55:19.246
Come on.

56:54.307 --> 56:55.273
Target practice?

56:57.034 --> 56:59.761
Yeah. I, um...

56:59.830 --> 57:02.833
I found a scope down in the cellar.
I'm trying to see if I can make it work.

57:05.525 --> 57:06.457
Can I try?

57:08.148 --> 57:10.219
Okay.

57:10.944 --> 57:11.980
Thanks.

57:30.654 --> 57:32.241
It's, uh, not bad.

57:34.727 --> 57:37.454
- Can I just show you one thing?
- Mmm-hmm.

57:38.282 --> 57:39.283
Okay.

57:39.973 --> 57:41.043
Square up.

57:42.459 --> 57:45.185
Okay. Now, step...
Lean into your front foot.

57:45.254 --> 57:46.393
- Okay.
- There you go.

57:46.463 --> 57:48.534
And relax.

57:50.259 --> 57:53.262
Now, when you pick out a target,
you wanna pick something small.

57:53.331 --> 57:55.472
So, let's say, the zipper,

57:57.094 --> 57:58.716
and then when you pull
on the trigger...

58:00.166 --> 58:04.101
Don't pull just squeeze.
Nice and easy.

58:16.803 --> 58:20.289
Okay. That was really good.

58:21.670 --> 58:22.844
Felt good.

58:24.535 --> 58:25.502
I didn't think I'd like it.

58:26.986 --> 58:29.609
Yeah?
A little change of heart?

58:31.680 --> 58:32.923
Just trying to play along.

58:45.798 --> 58:47.213
Are you gonna ask me
about the suitcase?

58:51.873 --> 58:52.874
No.

58:55.497 --> 58:56.774
I wanna show you something.

58:59.984 --> 59:01.710
We're almost there.
We should go.

59:05.645 --> 59:06.715
It'll only take a second.

59:54.211 --> 59:55.350
This is it, right?

59:57.904 --> 59:59.009
Wow.

01:00:27.451 --> 01:00:28.521
Well?

01:00:31.593 --> 01:00:32.905
This is it.

01:00:34.458 --> 01:00:36.598
I mean, my seats were black,

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:39.981
but I kind of like
the red better.

01:00:46.090 --> 01:00:47.574
Man, a lot of memories
in this car.

01:00:51.475 --> 01:00:52.579
First real date.

01:00:54.202 --> 01:00:56.273
First ticket. First accident.

01:00:57.895 --> 01:00:59.000
First roadie.

01:01:01.347 --> 01:01:02.624
Goose'n down the on-ramps.

01:01:05.627 --> 01:01:06.904
And what about back here?

01:01:10.287 --> 01:01:14.947
Uh, yeah, I was pretty cool
back then,

01:01:15.016 --> 01:01:17.121
but no, not that cool.

01:01:19.365 --> 01:01:20.642
So you never ever?

01:01:21.954 --> 01:01:23.231
Not even in the backseat?

01:01:24.957 --> 01:01:26.234
Never in a car.

01:01:30.134 --> 01:01:31.308
That makes two of us.

01:01:37.383 --> 01:01:40.386
And here we are.

01:02:17.078 --> 01:02:19.425
Oh, my God. My God!

01:03:18.484 --> 01:03:19.934
Come on!

01:03:58.696 --> 01:03:59.836
No!

01:04:02.735 --> 01:04:04.047
<i>Fuck!</i>

01:04:44.225 --> 01:04:46.296
Yo, Wanda, you got my money?

01:04:47.745 --> 01:04:50.438
Oh, baby, baby.

01:04:50.507 --> 01:04:53.372
- Vanilla latte.
- Whoo! Baby!

01:04:53.441 --> 01:04:56.340
Oh, baby, they smell like
sweet Kool-Aid.

01:04:56.409 --> 01:04:57.617
Special cream.

01:05:00.931 --> 01:05:02.312
Check out this dame.

01:05:16.982 --> 01:05:19.432
- Kick his ass, Scratchy!
- Cheating, motherfucker!

01:05:43.318 --> 01:05:44.354
Names?

01:05:47.184 --> 01:05:48.979
What's the money for?

01:05:49.048 --> 01:05:50.325
Names, please.

01:05:51.188 --> 01:05:52.465
What's the goddamn money...

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:56.366
Money's the only God
you have left.

01:05:57.919 --> 01:05:58.920
Names?

01:06:01.198 --> 01:06:02.372
Mark and Nina.

01:06:03.787 --> 01:06:05.030
West.

01:06:05.099 --> 01:06:06.134
Mmm.

01:06:07.584 --> 01:06:08.619
Married.

01:06:11.829 --> 01:06:13.555
Take them to the
Snake Eyes Suite.

01:06:23.013 --> 01:06:25.429
- <i>Yo, this is bullshit.</i>
- <i>Fuck you!</i>

01:06:27.466 --> 01:06:29.571
Stay the fuck out of here
with those manners.

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:32.126
- Eat it!
- Get out of here, you fucking creep.

01:06:33.092 --> 01:06:33.990
Relax.

01:06:59.912 --> 01:07:02.052
No!

01:07:09.439 --> 01:07:10.509
No!

01:07:12.304 --> 01:07:15.238
All right, bets are open!

01:07:15.307 --> 01:07:16.998
Bets are open! All right!

01:07:20.174 --> 01:07:21.209
Get in there.

01:07:21.278 --> 01:07:23.556
Now, bets are open!
Bets are open!

01:07:23.625 --> 01:07:25.041
Big money now! Come on now!

01:07:29.804 --> 01:07:31.599
Fuck!

01:07:31.668 --> 01:07:32.979
No! No!

01:07:37.846 --> 01:07:40.573
Bet them up! Bet them up!
Bet them up! Yeah!

01:07:40.642 --> 01:07:42.955
Let's see some gambling now,
we got fresh meat here.

01:07:43.024 --> 01:07:45.061
We got some live ones,
come on!

01:07:45.130 --> 01:07:46.752
Come on, let's see it!

01:07:50.135 --> 01:07:51.929
All right, bets are closed.

01:07:58.557 --> 01:07:59.661
Mark.

01:07:59.730 --> 01:08:01.732
I don't know.

01:08:13.296 --> 01:08:15.021
Now,

01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:19.060
after my count down from five
I want you both to pull the trigger.

01:08:19.129 --> 01:08:22.477
If you both fail to pull
the trigger on my count,

01:08:22.546 --> 01:08:25.515
I will be forced to add
two bullets to each gun

01:08:25.584 --> 01:08:29.035
thus making the total
bullet count three.

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:30.796
I think you see
where I'm going with this.

01:08:32.037 --> 01:08:35.386
So, do yourselves a favor

01:08:35.456 --> 01:08:37.630
and pull the fucking triggers.

01:08:38.734 --> 01:08:40.702
I heard you two are married.

01:08:40.770 --> 01:08:44.636
You make it six rounds,
and you get to go home.

01:08:44.706 --> 01:08:46.536
Capisce?

01:08:46.604 --> 01:08:47.846
<i>Hey, give me my money.</i>

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:50.055
Yeah!

01:08:54.819 --> 01:08:56.511
Count down with me now.

01:08:56.580 --> 01:09:00.032
Nina, point the gun down
as far as you can and pull the trigger.

01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:01.377
- I can't.
- Three...

01:09:01.447 --> 01:09:02.759
- It's our only chance. You have to.
- Two...

01:09:02.828 --> 01:09:03.828
Wait!

01:09:05.727 --> 01:09:07.212
You got a kiss for me,
little sweetheart?

01:09:08.627 --> 01:09:09.731
A wager.

01:09:10.491 --> 01:09:12.182
I'm listening.

01:09:12.251 --> 01:09:13.942
You put three bullets
in his gun...

01:09:16.117 --> 01:09:17.567
And we walk in two.

01:09:17.636 --> 01:09:18.499
Nina, what are you doing?

01:09:20.397 --> 01:09:22.399
Playing along.

01:09:24.435 --> 01:09:26.817
Higher stakes. Bigger take.

01:09:34.549 --> 01:09:38.381
Ladies and gentlemen,
the stakes have just risen!

01:09:41.935 --> 01:09:43.971
Three bullets in his gun

01:09:44.041 --> 01:09:46.042
and one in the little lady's.

01:09:46.112 --> 01:09:47.183
Three and one!

01:09:52.464 --> 01:09:54.154
This was a good idea.

01:09:55.363 --> 01:09:56.882
Count with me.

01:09:59.264 --> 01:10:02.198
Five, four, three,

01:10:02.646 --> 01:10:04.200
two, one.

01:10:12.277 --> 01:10:13.726
Round two!

01:10:14.555 --> 01:10:15.763
Place your bets!

01:10:15.832 --> 01:10:17.696
We got a marriage
on the line here!

01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:25.048
Count down with me.

01:10:27.326 --> 01:10:30.985
Five, four, three,

01:10:31.054 --> 01:10:32.952
- two, one.
- I'm okay.

01:10:33.781 --> 01:10:35.231
No!

01:10:37.129 --> 01:10:38.406
There you have it!

01:10:38.475 --> 01:10:40.926
A short game but a good game.

01:10:49.797 --> 01:10:51.350
Pay up, bitch! Come on!

01:10:51.419 --> 01:10:52.731
Calling me bitch!

01:10:54.319 --> 01:10:55.389
Whoa, ladies!

01:10:57.356 --> 01:11:00.221
Wanda! Goddamn it...

01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:02.016
I'm gonna kick your ass
out of here!

01:11:10.093 --> 01:11:11.439
Sit the fuck down!

01:11:21.794 --> 01:11:24.141
Fuck yeah! Bitch is hardcore!

01:11:30.355 --> 01:11:31.390
Somebody stop her.

01:11:33.875 --> 01:11:36.326
Stay the fuck back!

01:11:36.395 --> 01:11:38.811
Bitch, you better have a plan
because we're coming to get you.

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:40.744
Shut your fucking mouth!

01:11:40.813 --> 01:11:43.506
Ooh, I'd run as fast
as you can, girl.

01:11:43.575 --> 01:11:45.646
Jacket.
Give me the fucking jacket!

01:11:47.579 --> 01:11:49.235
This bitch is crazy!

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:50.961
Let's rush her.
She can't kill us all.

01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:52.929
Then I'll just have
to kill you first.

01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:56.795
It's okay. Let her go.

01:11:59.211 --> 01:12:01.869
This is gonna be fun.

01:12:08.254 --> 01:12:10.912
Bitch, I'm gonna give you
to the count of five.

01:12:20.266 --> 01:12:21.267
Guns!

01:12:26.134 --> 01:12:27.343
M-3 grease gun.

01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:31.243
The fucking gold grease gun,
motherfucker!

01:12:35.489 --> 01:12:37.870
Give me my fucking Uzi!

01:12:37.939 --> 01:12:38.940
Goddamn it!

01:12:50.193 --> 01:12:51.470
Come on!

01:12:55.094 --> 01:12:55.992
Come on!

01:12:58.097 --> 01:13:00.617
Shoot those motherfuckers!

01:13:09.281 --> 01:13:10.696
Fucking cunt!

01:13:10.765 --> 01:13:12.836
Yeah!

01:13:12.905 --> 01:13:14.459
Yeah! Come on!

01:13:14.528 --> 01:13:16.978
Somebody get my Stutz.

01:13:17.047 --> 01:13:19.464
Who's coming with me?
Who's coming with me?

01:13:20.913 --> 01:13:22.501
Huh? You?

01:13:24.779 --> 01:13:27.679
I just painted flames on my car
so I don't really want to...

01:13:27.748 --> 01:13:30.129
Fuck you! Let's go.

01:14:36.161 --> 01:14:37.576
I don't understand.

01:14:42.685 --> 01:14:44.549
Your father was very ill.

01:14:48.311 --> 01:14:52.557
This was in her hand
when I found her.

01:14:55.352 --> 01:14:58.183
I think your mom just wanted
to be with him.

01:15:28.075 --> 01:15:29.455
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:15:40.363 --> 01:15:41.571
How you feeling?

01:15:43.608 --> 01:15:44.885
I've been better.

01:15:50.649 --> 01:15:51.616
Are you okay?

01:15:56.172 --> 01:15:59.520
No, I'm not.

01:16:02.247 --> 01:16:03.455
But that's okay.

01:16:07.148 --> 01:16:08.149
I'm sorry.

01:16:10.635 --> 01:16:11.567
No.

01:16:14.846 --> 01:16:17.020
I never would have made it here
without you.

01:16:24.165 --> 01:16:25.719
Mom wrote me a letter.

01:16:27.444 --> 01:16:28.618
What'd it say?

01:16:30.586 --> 01:16:32.242
Don't shoot your husband.

01:16:59.442 --> 01:17:01.271
- How you doing, sweetheart?
- Hey.

01:17:02.721 --> 01:17:04.654
I didn't think people mowed
their lawns anymore.

01:17:05.206 --> 01:17:07.105
Well, normality.

01:17:07.174 --> 01:17:10.211
Uh, routine, home life.

01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:12.628
- Keeps us going.
- What about out there?

01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:14.975
The gangs.

01:17:15.044 --> 01:17:18.461
We get a Gambler or two
every so often.

01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:21.084
That's why we have
the car barricades.

01:17:21.153 --> 01:17:23.397
That's why it took so long
to get you in here, hon.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:25.710
Thank you.

01:17:25.779 --> 01:17:27.781
And we do lookout shifts
on the rooftops.

01:17:27.850 --> 01:17:30.093
Javier is up there now.

01:17:30.162 --> 01:17:32.648
Why don't you leave?
Find some place safer.

01:17:34.097 --> 01:17:35.651
Safety doesn't exist anymore.

01:17:36.444 --> 01:17:37.825
You have to fight for it.

01:17:40.725 --> 01:17:41.657
Hey.

01:17:42.692 --> 01:17:44.176
You want to see something cool?

01:17:46.075 --> 01:17:47.835
What am I looking at here?

01:17:47.904 --> 01:17:50.942
Well, basically,
it's a trip wire on steroids.

01:17:51.011 --> 01:17:53.876
Instead of stopping a man,
in theory, it should stop a tank.

01:17:55.118 --> 01:17:57.362
Mark's gonna love this.

01:17:57.431 --> 01:17:59.571
See, someone has to turn
the crank on the boat lift here,

01:18:00.848 --> 01:18:02.505
and that picks up
the slack in the line.

01:18:02.574 --> 01:18:05.059
Once the line is taught,
whatever runs into it

01:18:05.128 --> 01:18:08.718
takes the brunt of that little bad boy
right over there.

01:18:08.787 --> 01:18:12.135
And inside, enough explosive matter
to level a house.

01:18:13.171 --> 01:18:14.724
I made that.

01:18:14.793 --> 01:18:17.244
Well, look at this beautiful
ray of sunshine.

01:18:17.313 --> 01:18:18.245
Phil.

01:18:19.384 --> 01:18:20.316
Hey.

01:18:20.385 --> 01:18:21.524
Welcome home.

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:25.079
We'll talk later.

01:18:25.148 --> 01:18:26.909
- Come by for a refill.
- I will.

01:18:26.978 --> 01:18:28.876
Phil, I need you to
reset that barricade.

01:18:28.945 --> 01:18:30.015
Roger that.

01:18:34.848 --> 01:18:38.299
I'm sorry about your folks.
They were good people.

01:18:40.094 --> 01:18:41.095
Thank you.

01:19:39.705 --> 01:19:40.568
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:19:40.637 --> 01:19:42.260
Welcome to the neighborhood.

01:19:42.329 --> 01:19:44.641
- That's so sweet. Thank you. You shouldn't have.
- You're welcome.

01:19:45.815 --> 01:19:46.885
And what's your name?

01:19:47.886 --> 01:19:48.887
Cynthia.

01:19:48.956 --> 01:19:49.957
You can say hi.

01:19:50.613 --> 01:19:51.683
She's shy.

01:19:53.512 --> 01:19:55.687
Well, that's a very
pretty name.

01:20:22.403 --> 01:20:24.405
I swear I'm looking
at it right now.

01:20:24.474 --> 01:20:26.235
<i>All right, thanks, Phil.
We're coming.</i>

01:21:06.447 --> 01:21:07.448
Nina?

01:21:48.317 --> 01:21:50.906
<i>Phil, a minute from your place.
What's your 20?</i>

01:22:16.655 --> 01:22:17.794
Oh, my God.

01:22:28.426 --> 01:22:31.843
Cynthia! Come here.
Come here. Jump up.

01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:35.295
Run with me. Good girl.

01:22:40.058 --> 01:22:41.335
Well, shit.

01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:45.477
- Whoa, whoa, what's going on?
- Gamblers.

01:22:45.546 --> 01:22:46.720
What? They followed us?

01:22:46.789 --> 01:22:48.549
No. Phil sold us out.

01:22:48.618 --> 01:22:51.725
- What? Who's this?
- Cynthia. It's the neighbor's daughter.

01:22:51.794 --> 01:22:54.072
Hi, sweetie.
Whoa, what are you doing?

01:22:54.141 --> 01:22:55.522
What does it look like I'm doing?

01:22:55.591 --> 01:22:57.351
Nina, no. We should go.

01:22:57.420 --> 01:22:58.283
- We should leave right now.
- We can't just leave these people, Markus.

01:22:58.352 --> 01:22:59.595
This is all they have.

01:23:00.182 --> 01:23:01.148
Nina, wait.

01:23:02.632 --> 01:23:03.633
Cover me.

01:23:40.291 --> 01:23:42.707
Fucking suburbs!

01:23:42.776 --> 01:23:46.124
Remind me to come back here
and burn this whole motherfucking place down.

01:23:49.610 --> 01:23:51.543
That's it.

01:23:51.612 --> 01:23:53.856
Radio Jerry, tell him we found
his brother's car

01:23:53.925 --> 01:23:56.100
and that bitch
who popped a cap in his ass.

01:23:57.929 --> 01:23:59.586
Where the fuck is Phil?

01:24:00.483 --> 01:24:01.553
Shit!

01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:15.222
Shoot that bitch!

01:24:34.793 --> 01:24:36.795
Machine gunner at nine o'clock!

01:24:36.864 --> 01:24:37.865
Here we go.

01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:01.751
Hey, hey,
should I get the wheel?

01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:03.891
Fuck the wheel! There are people trying
to kill us. Kill 'em back!

01:25:05.997 --> 01:25:07.619
Oh, fuck! Go! Go! Go!

01:25:10.898 --> 01:25:12.314
Cynthia! Cynthia!

01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:14.764
Oh, shit!

01:25:23.704 --> 01:25:24.809
Fucking shoot!

01:25:30.401 --> 01:25:31.747
Oh, fuck! Mike!

01:25:34.370 --> 01:25:35.682
Holy buckets!

01:26:06.402 --> 01:26:07.679
No.

01:26:07.748 --> 01:26:11.200
Plowboys!

01:26:11.269 --> 01:26:14.755
Gamblers? What the fuck are
Gamblers doing here?

01:26:14.824 --> 01:26:17.551
Who gives a shit!
Kill the whore.

01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:19.001
Fucking Cherries.

01:26:25.525 --> 01:26:26.491
Let's go, motherfucker!

01:26:59.662 --> 01:27:00.836
Come on!

01:27:03.908 --> 01:27:05.220
Oh, shit!

01:27:23.238 --> 01:27:24.342
There.

01:27:26.758 --> 01:27:28.035
What do you wanna do now?

01:27:28.104 --> 01:27:30.969
You hold the street.
I'll handle this bitch.

01:27:34.490 --> 01:27:35.388
Goddamn it!

01:27:56.995 --> 01:27:58.203
For her.

01:28:06.419 --> 01:28:07.316
Thank you.

01:28:21.710 --> 01:28:22.814
Typical.

01:28:26.093 --> 01:28:27.267
Fuck you.

01:28:42.144 --> 01:28:43.283
One more.

01:29:57.357 --> 01:29:59.083
Cynthia. Cynthia!

01:29:59.152 --> 01:30:00.084
Hurry up!

01:31:01.179 --> 01:31:02.664
I love you, Markus.

01:31:38.182 --> 01:31:39.494
<i>Here's another safety update</i>

01:31:39.563 --> 01:31:41.461
<i>for all you domestics
out there.</i>

01:31:41.530 --> 01:31:45.292
<i>Just when you thought you've heard it all,
something like this comes along.</i>

01:31:45.361 --> 01:31:48.054
<i>Rumor has it,
there's a husband and wife</i>

01:31:48.123 --> 01:31:53.266
<i>that just took out a platoon of Gamblers
in Milwaukee, and they're heading west.</i>

01:31:53.335 --> 01:31:57.719

banging sons of bitches,</i>

<i>these two lovebirds
ain't fucking around.</i>

<i>You see, this is why
I still have hope.</i>

01:32:04.035 --> 01:32:08.695
<i>Because amongst all the savagery,

01:32:08.764 --> 01:32:13.286
<i>and it's the ones who love
that will change the motherfucking world.</i>
