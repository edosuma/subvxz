I was just trying
to do the right thing, man.

39:51.823 --> 39:53.156
For Jesse.

39:57.929 --> 40:00.764
All right.

40:00.766 --> 40:02.999
What about the others?

40:04.603 --> 40:06.603
Do they get a pass?

40:06.605 --> 40:08.772
This time.

40:08.774 --> 40:10.473
Thank you.

40:12.711 --> 40:14.878
Thank you.

40:18.984 --> 40:21.050
[ Sighs ]

40:29.528 --> 40:31.461
There were, uh, complications

40:31.463 --> 40:34.531
with your patient, Jeff,
the paramedic.

40:34.533 --> 40:36.032
He's fine, but the bleed was

40:36.034 --> 40:38.034
on the left side,
not on the right.

40:38.036 --> 40:40.837
I intubated the wrong side?

40:42.007 --> 40:43.840
I could have killed him.

40:43.842 --> 40:47.877
Well, you didn't.
I corrected it, so...

40:47.879 --> 40:49.179
don't do that, leanne.

40:49.181 --> 40:50.713
Don't internalize this.

40:50.715 --> 40:51.881
We all make mistakes.

40:51.883 --> 40:53.950
Not like that one.

40:56.521 --> 40:59.155
What is it Jesse says?

40:59.157 --> 41:00.824
"Lean on each other.

41:00.826 --> 41:03.693
That's what
siblings are for."

41:03.695 --> 41:08.064
You think he's all you have,
but you're wrong, leanne.

41:08.066 --> 41:09.732
You have me.

41:11.036 --> 41:12.902
You have all of us.

41:16.975 --> 41:19.042
Thank you.

41:28.520 --> 41:31.588

42:14.966 --> 42:17.133
Cole:
What are you doing?

42:17.135 --> 42:18.768
Living.
