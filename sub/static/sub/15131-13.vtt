WEBVTT

00:03.303 --> 00:05.238
So, what do you think
of, uh, Alex's decision?

00:05.963 --> 00:07.341
Well, she is right.

00:07.391 --> 00:09.009
It is safer to wait
until after the baby's born

00:09.043 --> 00:10.818
to do a paternity test, so...

00:10.868 --> 00:12.311
- It's the right thing to do.
- Yeah.

00:12.379 --> 00:15.515
Just need to show a little bit of patience.

00:18.885 --> 00:20.686
- But?
- Well, come on, man.

00:20.754 --> 00:23.356
We're not exactly masters of patience

00:23.390 --> 00:24.990
when it comes to Alex.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.260
No, but this isn't
just about you and me anymore.

00:27.294 --> 00:30.362
This is... Or even Alex, for that matter.

00:30.396 --> 00:32.965
So it's...

00:32.999 --> 00:33.966
We wait.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.668
Agreed.

00:37.754 --> 00:38.909
Deal?

00:38.959 --> 00:40.022
Yep.

00:40.753 --> 00:41.740
Deal.

00:47.413 --> 00:49.747
[siren wails in distance]

00:49.815 --> 00:52.884
[monitor beeping]

00:53.656 --> 00:54.686
Alex: So, we'll put in the stent.

00:54.753 --> 00:56.621
I'll handle the vascular if you can retract.

00:56.689 --> 00:57.789
Damn it.

00:57.823 --> 00:59.524
- You okay?
- Yeah.

00:59.559 --> 01:00.692
Yeah, I'm totally fine.

01:00.726 --> 01:02.293
Do you need help putting on your mask?

01:02.360 --> 01:03.628
No, I most certainly do not.

01:03.662 --> 01:06.631
Dr. Reid, could you come here for a sec?

01:07.420 --> 01:09.033
Dr. Katz. Yeah. What do you need?

01:09.068 --> 01:10.568
You shouldn't be in that surgery, Alex.

01:10.603 --> 01:12.303
It was just a hand cramp.

01:12.337 --> 01:14.338
No, there's radioactive
fluoroscopy in there.

01:14.406 --> 01:16.774
You're pregnant, radiation...
bad for babies.

01:16.809 --> 01:19.042
There's no more radiation
than in an ultrasound.

01:19.111 --> 01:20.211
Don't do it.

01:20.245 --> 01:21.645
I'm new here, but I've heard stories,

01:21.679 --> 01:23.013
and you are remarkably unlucky.

01:23.081 --> 01:25.116
I wouldn't take any chances
with your baby right now.

01:25.150 --> 01:27.318
- Seriously?
- Doctor's orders.

01:27.352 --> 01:28.586
Maggie: I'll take the surgery.

01:28.620 --> 01:30.087
Larouche can assist me.

01:30.122 --> 01:31.522
Thanks.

01:31.556 --> 01:34.024
Go, uh, do some paperwork or something.

01:35.660 --> 01:37.127
All right.

01:38.529 --> 01:40.631
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:40.665 --> 01:43.466
So, I, um... I saw on the board

01:43.534 --> 01:45.769
that you've got three hip
replacements this afternoon.

01:45.803 --> 01:46.903
That is correct.

01:46.971 --> 01:48.802
I wanted to see if I could trade you one

01:48.875 --> 01:51.741
for my arthroscopic knee shaving at 5:00.

01:51.775 --> 01:53.943
Want to see if I can hit the gym
sometime today.

01:59.650 --> 02:02.352
Or you could just keep checking
your phone like a teenager.

02:02.386 --> 02:03.786
I'm so sorry, man.

02:03.820 --> 02:05.355
I'm supposed to hear
from my lawyer today about all the...

02:05.422 --> 02:07.157
um...

02:07.191 --> 02:09.692
Yeah. Right.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.995
Um, hey, just forget about
the knee thing, man.

02:13.063 --> 02:15.064
No, mate, honestly, I'm happy to take it.

02:15.098 --> 02:17.667
Anything to take my mind off
the fact that...

02:17.734 --> 02:21.003
I may or may not be going
to trial for a murder.

02:23.000 --> 02:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:30.146 --> 02:33.232
More paperwork. Someone call a code beige.

02:33.282 --> 02:34.680
I feel completely useless.

02:34.758 --> 02:36.991
Hmm. Who are you, and what
have you done with Alex Reid?

02:37.041 --> 02:39.495
Oh she's pregnant and
basically forbidden to work.

02:39.545 --> 02:43.203
You can always do dermatology.
Warts, boils and beyond.

02:43.302 --> 02:44.638
Thanks.

02:44.688 --> 02:48.114
I'm a fledgling obstetrician,
but, uh, you want my advice?

02:48.164 --> 02:49.080
Yes.

02:49.130 --> 02:50.255
Take a walk.

02:50.333 --> 02:52.633
- What?
- Fresh air will do you good.

02:52.668 --> 02:55.469
And it will make me feel like
I'm doing something.

02:55.504 --> 02:56.871
Thanks, Maggie.

02:56.939 --> 02:58.506
You're very welcome.

03:01.485 --> 03:03.405
Hello. I'm Dr. Harris.

03:03.455 --> 03:04.478
What? That's... that's not him?

03:04.546 --> 03:06.180
And you are leaving.

03:06.248 --> 03:07.515
She want to see Dr. Joel.

03:07.549 --> 03:09.149
She already told the other guy.

03:09.184 --> 03:11.118
Okay, well, I'm the guy
who's here right now,

03:11.152 --> 03:12.320
so, Sou, why don't you, um,

03:12.354 --> 03:14.354
tell me what it is that brought you here.

03:14.422 --> 03:17.157
She doesn't speak,
and she is as stubborn as an ox.

03:17.192 --> 03:18.859
Yeah, I can see that.

03:18.893 --> 03:20.260
Look, it took everything I had

03:20.328 --> 03:21.829
to get her to come in here today.

03:21.863 --> 03:22.963
Go get Dr. Joel.

03:23.286 --> 03:26.190
Okay, um, Sou, can I just have a look?

03:26.315 --> 03:27.960
Sou? [speaks khmer] Sou?

03:28.010 --> 03:29.336
Sou? You're holding your mouth.

03:29.370 --> 03:32.239
Can you tell me where... just where you...

03:32.273 --> 03:33.473
Okay, those are your teeth. I...

03:33.507 --> 03:34.907
Look, I need you to sit down right now.

03:34.942 --> 03:36.443
Sit down now, please.

03:36.753 --> 03:38.802
Just... okay.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.113
Um, Sou...

03:41.116 --> 03:42.794
I need you to take this

03:42.871 --> 03:45.285
and apply some pressure on your mouth.

03:45.319 --> 03:47.253
- What happened?
- Okay.

03:47.287 --> 03:51.157
You keep her here and, uh,
I will go get Dr. Joel.

03:53.894 --> 03:54.994
You're going for a hike?

03:55.028 --> 03:56.428
So many things can bite you up there.

03:56.463 --> 03:58.597
Everyone's so worried about me.

03:58.632 --> 04:00.967
Because you're pregnant,
and you had open-heart surgery.

04:01.001 --> 04:02.268
Alex, go easy.

04:02.302 --> 04:03.935
I know, and everybody
keeps saying that, too.

04:03.970 --> 04:06.071
You know, I've been doing more
paperwork than a photocopier.

04:06.639 --> 04:08.473
[chuckles] Look at this.

04:08.507 --> 04:09.607
Shahir.

04:09.675 --> 04:11.342
Okay, you shouldn't lift anything heavy,

04:11.377 --> 04:12.677
and don't refinish furniture.

04:12.745 --> 04:14.312
Hmm. Oh, because of the solvents.

04:14.346 --> 04:15.680
And don't change cat litter.

04:15.748 --> 04:17.415
That's because of the toxoplasmosis.

04:17.483 --> 04:19.084
Well, I don't have a cat.

04:19.152 --> 04:22.019
Where are you getting
all this stuff from, anyway?

04:22.087 --> 04:23.488
Preggyworries.com

04:23.555 --> 04:24.889
I got a cat. Did I tell you?

04:24.923 --> 04:26.223
- No.
- Yeah.

04:26.258 --> 04:28.192
I named her after my favorite actress.

04:28.226 --> 04:30.428
Kathy Bates.

04:30.496 --> 04:32.029
I'm going now.

04:32.063 --> 04:33.864
Okay, well, make sure you call me
as soon as you leave the forest.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.767
- I will. Bye.
- Bye.

04:41.306 --> 04:44.474
[birds chirping]

04:46.344 --> 04:47.878
[sighs]

04:58.489 --> 05:01.157
[metallic jingle]

05:01.192 --> 05:03.259
Hey.

05:03.294 --> 05:05.094
Come here.

05:05.129 --> 05:07.130
What are you doing out here?

05:07.198 --> 05:09.232
Come on!

05:09.266 --> 05:11.267
Man: Someone help, please!

05:11.302 --> 05:14.237
[barking]

05:15.806 --> 05:17.673
Please. Someone help, please.

05:17.708 --> 05:19.442
I'm coming. I'm coming! Oh, my god.

05:19.509 --> 05:21.177
Please.

05:21.245 --> 05:23.412
I'm coming. I'm here to help.

05:23.480 --> 05:25.915
[grunts]

05:25.950 --> 05:28.984
Please. I'm stuck.

05:29.018 --> 05:30.953
Please help me.

05:30.987 --> 05:33.055
[grunting]

05:42.724 --> 05:43.991
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

05:44.026 --> 05:45.092
I can't move.

05:45.126 --> 05:46.226
I can see that. Okay, my name's Alex.

05:46.294 --> 05:47.828
I'm a doctor. What's your name?

05:47.863 --> 05:49.196
Sam.

05:49.264 --> 05:50.598
Is this your dog, Sam?

05:50.632 --> 05:52.600
[sniffles] Yeah. Faro. His name is Faro.

05:52.634 --> 05:54.201
Faro's a good dog.
He brought me right to you.

05:54.235 --> 05:55.302
How long have you been here?

05:55.336 --> 05:56.571
Uh, since this morning.

05:56.638 --> 05:58.138
I-I was trail running,

05:58.173 --> 06:00.441
- and th-there was a storm last night.
- Right.

06:00.475 --> 06:02.809
Okay, so you run cross-country?

06:02.843 --> 06:06.380
Uh, the semi-finals are coming up.

06:06.414 --> 06:08.549
Well, your heart rate's a little fast, Sam.

06:08.583 --> 06:09.816
Can you feel your feet?

06:09.850 --> 06:11.851
Uh...

06:11.919 --> 06:15.021
Uh... yeah.

06:15.090 --> 06:16.790
Sam: - I-I think so.
- Okay.

06:18.358 --> 06:19.593
Aah!

06:19.627 --> 06:20.827
What about your big toe?
Can you move it for me?

06:20.861 --> 06:21.861
Yeah.

06:21.896 --> 06:23.329
- [grunts]
- Good.

06:23.363 --> 06:25.065
And your ankle. Move it up and down.

06:25.099 --> 06:26.833
No. No, no, no.

06:26.867 --> 06:28.068
Is it broken?

06:28.102 --> 06:30.036
Yeah, I think it is.

06:30.104 --> 06:31.537
Okay. I'm gonna call for help.

06:31.606 --> 06:33.239
You just hang in there, all right?

06:33.273 --> 06:35.575
- Okay.
- Hang in there.

06:35.609 --> 06:38.144
Come on.

06:38.178 --> 06:41.013
[groaning]

06:41.047 --> 06:42.881
I'm not getting any cell reception.

06:42.949 --> 06:44.917
So, plan "B."

06:46.753 --> 06:48.287
Sou.

06:48.355 --> 06:50.355
Oh, Sou. Yeah, tiny woman, doesn't speak.

06:50.389 --> 06:51.137
Yeah.

06:51.266 --> 06:52.992
Yeah, she's a patient of mine
over at the clinic.

06:53.059 --> 06:54.627
- She's, uh, cambodian,
- I think. That's her.

06:54.661 --> 06:57.129
She, uh, pulled out three
of her teeth just like that.

06:57.163 --> 06:59.464
Whoa. Okay. What do you think?

06:59.499 --> 07:01.100
Uh, could be a dental issue.

07:01.167 --> 07:03.902
- If she's lucky.
- <i>If</i> she's lucky.

07:03.937 --> 07:06.238
Hi, Sou.

07:06.305 --> 07:09.007
What's happening? You want me to help you?

07:09.074 --> 07:12.277
You want to take a seat up here for me?

07:12.311 --> 07:13.878
That's it, sweetheart.

07:13.946 --> 07:15.046
Thank you.

07:15.080 --> 07:18.517
Okay, Sou, open your mouth up for me.

07:18.551 --> 07:19.917
Open up.

07:19.952 --> 07:23.587
Okay. Just tilt your head back for me.

07:23.622 --> 07:25.156
Charlie, you need to take a look at this.

07:28.326 --> 07:30.394
Okay.

07:30.428 --> 07:32.797
Just give me the "ah." There we go.

07:32.831 --> 07:35.232
- Oh, yeah, that's...
- Yeah.

07:35.267 --> 07:37.334
How long has it been like this, Sou?

07:37.402 --> 07:39.036
How long have you had this?

07:39.103 --> 07:40.471
She's not...

07:40.505 --> 07:42.173
Uh, we... we're gonna have to admit you

07:42.207 --> 07:43.440
to the hospital right away.

07:43.508 --> 07:46.843
Sou, where is your friend, the, um, uh...

07:46.878 --> 07:48.612
- What's that, mate?
- Uh, nothing.

07:48.647 --> 07:51.582
Hey, Zach, where's the, uh,
the girl who came in with Sou?

07:51.650 --> 07:54.051
I have no idea. She came in here alone.

08:03.837 --> 08:04.995
Hello, stranger.

08:05.029 --> 08:06.196
Hey.

08:07.631 --> 08:09.032
Where you been?

08:09.067 --> 08:12.235
Just had to take a couple days off.

08:12.269 --> 08:14.437
It's been lonely here without you.

08:14.471 --> 08:16.706
I bet.

08:16.740 --> 08:17.940
I'm sorry I didn't call.

08:17.974 --> 08:19.942
Yeah, well [clears throat] you're here now.

08:20.010 --> 08:22.512
So, listen.

08:22.546 --> 08:24.480
I, uh, I have my vest.

08:24.515 --> 08:26.416
I have my camo pants,

08:26.450 --> 08:28.751
which are different from my coma pants.

08:28.785 --> 08:30.385
How about a little paintball?

08:32.422 --> 08:33.789
Melanda, I'm, uh...

08:33.823 --> 08:35.791
"Melanda," what?

08:35.826 --> 08:38.126
I'm just not really feeling it right now.

08:38.195 --> 08:39.660
Oh, you'll feel it

08:39.730 --> 08:42.898
once I have you cornered in a bunker.

08:44.267 --> 08:46.768
My head's not in it right now, so...

08:46.836 --> 08:48.937
Is something wrong?

08:48.971 --> 08:50.606
No. I just...

08:50.640 --> 08:52.807
I got a lot on my plate, and...

08:52.842 --> 08:55.110
[sighs]

08:55.144 --> 08:56.478
You're walking like an old man.
What's wrong?

08:56.512 --> 08:58.380
I don't want any paintball!

09:01.817 --> 09:03.384
[scoffs]

09:09.024 --> 09:10.992
Bernice.

09:11.026 --> 09:12.961
Is that you? Bernice?

09:12.995 --> 09:13.995
Yeah, that's me.

09:14.029 --> 09:15.529
- Okay.
- That's my name.

09:15.564 --> 09:16.798
Okay, good.

09:16.832 --> 09:19.166
So, what brought you
into my E.R. today, Bernice?

09:19.200 --> 09:21.235
Oh, I need a note for worker's comp.

09:21.270 --> 09:24.071
I think I have a repetitive
strain injury from work.

09:24.105 --> 09:25.673
- What's your work?
- I'm a dancer.

09:25.707 --> 09:26.807
What kind?

09:26.841 --> 09:29.377
Ballet. I'm a ballerina.

09:29.444 --> 09:32.212
Um, it hurts like the dickens
when I do this.

09:32.247 --> 09:34.514
So don't do that.

09:34.548 --> 09:38.819
It's probably a deep
abdominal strain or, um...

09:38.853 --> 09:40.154
But will you write me a note?

09:40.188 --> 09:42.055
I'm sorry. It's not that easy.

09:42.090 --> 09:43.090
But I can't keep dancing.

09:43.124 --> 09:44.457
You know what?

09:44.492 --> 09:46.026
Why don't you bring it up
with your company physician?

09:46.060 --> 09:47.627
'Cause he'll surely write you a note.

09:47.695 --> 09:49.797
All right, I... [sighs]

09:49.864 --> 09:51.898
I'm a stripper.

09:53.133 --> 09:57.704
My stomach is killing me,
probably from stress, but...

09:57.738 --> 09:59.872
Why didn't you just say that?
You didn't need to lie.

09:59.907 --> 10:01.874
'Cause I thought
you wouldn't take me seriously.

10:01.909 --> 10:04.544
Most people call me champagne.

10:07.047 --> 10:08.948
Okay.

10:08.982 --> 10:10.516
Show me where it hurts, Bernice.

10:10.583 --> 10:13.719
Okay. Does it hurt when I do this?

10:13.787 --> 10:15.387
No.

10:15.422 --> 10:16.655
- This?
- Aah!

10:16.723 --> 10:18.724
Yeah. That hurts a lot.

10:18.758 --> 10:20.126
- You messing with me?
- No.

10:20.160 --> 10:22.261
This is real. For real.

10:22.296 --> 10:23.729
Okay.

10:23.763 --> 10:25.331
Well, I'm gonna have to do an ultrasound,

10:25.398 --> 10:27.299
but we're slammed right now,
so just hang out here

10:27.367 --> 10:28.967
and I'll come back in a little bit, okay?

10:29.001 --> 10:30.436
- Okay.
- Okay. Just hang out.

10:30.503 --> 10:32.904
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10:32.972 --> 10:35.073
Sam: What are you doing?

10:35.107 --> 10:37.443
I'm gonna splint your broken leg, Sam.

10:37.477 --> 10:39.611
I can hardly even feel it.

10:39.679 --> 10:41.579
Well, I guess you're gonna have
to trust me on this one, okay?

10:41.647 --> 10:42.680
It's broken.

10:42.748 --> 10:45.150
And it may seem like small potatoes,

10:45.184 --> 10:46.517
but I got to fix it.

10:46.585 --> 10:48.320
Okay, so you're a runner, right?

10:48.354 --> 10:50.188
Come on. Tell me something.
What do you like?

10:50.256 --> 10:54.125
Uh, magic cards, Andy Samberg.

10:54.193 --> 10:55.493
He's a funny guy.

10:55.527 --> 10:58.796
What about running?
What do you like about it?

10:58.831 --> 11:00.732
When I'm alone, I-I-I-I, you know,

11:00.766 --> 11:02.600
I can hear my-my breathing.

11:02.634 --> 11:03.601
I...

11:03.635 --> 11:04.935
[groans]

11:04.970 --> 11:06.437
Y-you're hurting me.

11:06.505 --> 11:08.573
Are you heckling me?

11:08.607 --> 11:11.075
Tell me about the run, the finals.

11:11.109 --> 11:13.310
I-I-I-I came in 10th last year.

11:13.345 --> 11:15.279
From the whole city?

11:15.313 --> 11:16.780
That's amazing.

11:16.848 --> 11:18.349
I'm, uh...

11:18.383 --> 11:19.950
I'm allergic to peanut butter.

11:19.985 --> 11:21.919
You're not missing much.

11:21.953 --> 11:23.354
Hey, you got a girlfriend?

11:23.388 --> 11:25.489
I, uh, I got a couple.

11:25.523 --> 11:27.324
Okay, Casanova.

11:27.359 --> 11:28.458
I'm gonna go up higher

11:28.526 --> 11:30.527
to try to get cell reception, all right?

11:30.561 --> 11:31.961
No, no, no. Please don't leave. Please.

11:31.996 --> 11:33.162
It's gonna be okay.

11:33.197 --> 11:36.600
Just listen to me. You need to stay warm.

11:36.634 --> 11:38.702
Hey, you ever cozy up with Faro?

11:38.736 --> 11:41.938
Faro, Faro, lie down, boy. Lie down.

11:42.006 --> 11:44.274
[dog whines]

11:44.308 --> 11:45.341
Good. Okay.

11:45.376 --> 11:47.443
I'm gonna be back. Don't worry.

11:47.477 --> 11:51.147
Good boy. Good boy, Faro.

11:58.655 --> 12:00.489
[sighs]

12:06.162 --> 12:08.263
Oh. Okay.

12:10.700 --> 12:12.200
Hi.

12:12.235 --> 12:15.103
Hello, I need an ambulance to
rattlesnake point hiking trail.

12:15.138 --> 12:16.238
I have a teenager.

12:16.272 --> 12:17.907
He's about, uh, a mile and a half in.

12:17.974 --> 12:19.674
He's been trapped under a fallen tree.

12:19.708 --> 12:20.943
He's hypothermic.

12:21.010 --> 12:22.877
He has grade-two strength
through his extremities.

12:22.912 --> 12:24.313
Yes, I'll-I'll stay on the line.

12:24.380 --> 12:27.182
Just, uh... hello? Hello?

12:27.216 --> 12:28.383
[sighs]

12:28.418 --> 12:30.185
No, no, no.

12:30.219 --> 12:31.820
Oh.

12:31.854 --> 12:33.355
Come on.

12:33.389 --> 12:37.992
So, we've discovered a tumor
in the roof of your mouth.

12:38.026 --> 12:40.528
Sou, you have cancer.

12:40.596 --> 12:42.664
[monitor beeping]

12:42.698 --> 12:45.934
Um, the tumor's about the size
of a ping-pong ball.

12:45.968 --> 12:48.903
It's very large for this-this area.

12:48.938 --> 12:50.472
It's partially blocking your airway,

12:50.506 --> 12:52.873
which is why you're having the
difficulties you are breathing.

12:52.941 --> 12:54.942
There's no guarantee we could remove it all,

12:54.977 --> 12:57.211
and, well, quite frankly,
even if we could, there'd...

12:57.279 --> 12:58.479
There'd be no way for us to fix the damage

12:58.513 --> 12:59.613
that we would do to your hard palate.

12:59.647 --> 13:03.417
We just don't see any surgical option.

13:05.387 --> 13:07.088
Sorry.

13:07.122 --> 13:10.090
Do you understand what we're saying?

13:10.157 --> 13:13.760
Okay, is there anyone
we can contact for you?

13:13.828 --> 13:14.928
Her son.

13:14.963 --> 13:17.498
Samnang.

13:17.565 --> 13:18.932
Samnang?

13:18.967 --> 13:20.066
Excuse me. What?

13:20.101 --> 13:22.803
Samnang. Samnang? Your, uh, your son?

13:22.837 --> 13:26.206
His name is Samnang?

13:26.240 --> 13:28.541
Okay. Well, we'll-we'll do our best

13:28.575 --> 13:30.477
to-to get ahold of him.

13:30.511 --> 13:31.544
He won't come.

13:31.612 --> 13:34.314
She hasn't seen him in years.

13:40.854 --> 13:43.322
Well, you can't win them all.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.992
How did you know about the son?

13:46.026 --> 13:48.895
Um... admissions form.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.163
[cellphone vibrates]

13:51.197 --> 13:52.431
Your lawyer?

13:52.465 --> 13:54.099
No. The E.R.

13:54.134 --> 13:56.135
Catch you later.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.904
Thanks, mate.

14:01.541 --> 14:02.974
Who are you?

14:03.009 --> 14:05.244
I'm her sister... Chantou.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.913
And I've been walking beside her
for almost 40 years.

14:07.947 --> 14:10.082
- How?
- It doesn't matter.

14:10.116 --> 14:12.584
Bring Samnang back to her.

14:12.618 --> 14:14.819
I'm not going anywhere until you do.

14:23.729 --> 14:25.363
- Alex: Oh, no, no, no.
- [whines]

14:25.397 --> 14:26.364
Sam?

14:26.398 --> 14:27.832
Sam!

14:27.867 --> 14:30.802
Sam? Talk to me, honey. Talk to me.

14:30.836 --> 14:33.504
I-I-I'm just too tired.

14:33.539 --> 14:36.307
I know you are, but you have to
stay awake, all right?

14:36.341 --> 14:37.575
Sam?

14:37.642 --> 14:39.043
Sam!

14:42.738 --> 14:44.492
Sam, wake up. Wake up, okay?

14:44.526 --> 14:46.561
Can't... can't... look...

14:46.629 --> 14:47.728
You just have to keep going.

14:47.763 --> 14:49.429
I know what you're trying to do. You're...

14:49.464 --> 14:51.866
you're trying to distract me
because I'm dying.

14:51.900 --> 14:53.768
You are not dying.

14:53.802 --> 14:55.069
- I can't feel my feet.
- Okay.

14:55.103 --> 14:57.805
Okay. All right.

14:57.839 --> 15:00.440
I'm gonna take your blood
pressure, honey, okay?

15:00.475 --> 15:01.508
Here we go.

15:02.651 --> 15:04.010
Can you just...

15:04.078 --> 15:05.545
just tell my dad

15:05.613 --> 15:07.714
that I'm not...
I'm not mad at him for leaving?

15:07.782 --> 15:08.948
You can tell him yourself.

15:08.983 --> 15:11.918
No, I can't. I'm too tired.

15:11.952 --> 15:13.654
No, I need you, Sam.
Where's your allergy pen?

15:13.721 --> 15:15.088
My what?

15:15.122 --> 15:16.590
You're allergic to peanuts.
Your allergy pen.

15:16.658 --> 15:17.791
I know it's on you. Where is it?

15:17.825 --> 15:19.493
- My jacket.
- Okay.

15:21.461 --> 15:24.430
- We're working as a team, all right?
- Yes.

15:24.464 --> 15:26.099
- You gonna inject me?
- Sort of.

15:26.133 --> 15:28.902
If I give you a dose,
you'll get one big rush,

15:28.969 --> 15:31.404
but then it'll go away in five minutes,

15:31.471 --> 15:32.638
so what we're gonna do is

15:32.706 --> 15:33.973
we're gonna give you
small doses of epinephrine

15:34.008 --> 15:35.541
to keep your blood pressure up, all right?

15:35.575 --> 15:36.742
Like sprints?

15:36.777 --> 15:38.210
Yes. Exactly.

15:38.244 --> 15:40.179
Okay, you need to stay awake, though.

15:40.213 --> 15:41.414
Stay with me, all right?

15:41.448 --> 15:44.049
There you go. And there it is.

15:44.083 --> 15:45.451
All right.

15:45.519 --> 15:47.286
Good job. You're doing great, okay?

15:47.321 --> 15:48.987
Just hang on a little bit longer.

15:49.022 --> 15:51.056
Just a little bit longer.

15:51.090 --> 15:53.792
[breathing heavily]

15:53.860 --> 15:56.728
There's really nothing we can do.

15:56.796 --> 15:58.463
I can't accept that.

15:58.531 --> 16:00.432
She's been through...

16:00.499 --> 16:02.667
<i>we've</i> been through too much already.

16:02.735 --> 16:04.536
[sighs]

16:04.570 --> 16:06.604
I'm sorry. I...

16:06.672 --> 16:10.141
When she came over, she had nothing.

16:10.175 --> 16:12.844
And then she had him.

16:12.878 --> 16:15.012
- Samnang?
- Yes.

16:15.080 --> 16:18.282
He was her-her everything.

16:18.317 --> 16:21.085
And when they took him away from her,

16:21.119 --> 16:22.487
she never recover.

16:22.521 --> 16:24.356
But he's grown up now.

16:24.423 --> 16:26.290
Bring him back to her.

16:26.325 --> 16:28.492
I don't... I don't know if I can do that.

16:28.526 --> 16:29.760
- I mean, I...
- Please.

16:29.794 --> 16:32.663
She needs someone who can take care of her.

16:32.697 --> 16:35.166
Someone who-who is isn't a...

16:35.234 --> 16:37.168
A ghost?

16:37.236 --> 16:39.503
Yes.

16:39.537 --> 16:45.275
I died 40 years ago on a boat from Cambodia,

16:45.309 --> 16:47.210
escaping the Khmer Rouge.

16:49.614 --> 16:51.382
Yeah.

16:51.416 --> 16:53.517
I'm sorry.

16:53.551 --> 16:56.119
How is it you're still here?

16:56.153 --> 16:57.788
[sighs]

16:57.822 --> 17:01.258
I am inside my sister.

17:03.394 --> 17:05.328
I died.

17:05.363 --> 17:07.964
For days in a shipping container,

17:08.031 --> 17:11.134
she lay beside my dead body.

17:11.167 --> 17:14.069
There was no food.

17:14.105 --> 17:16.839
She would have died, too.

17:20.343 --> 17:21.810
She...?

17:21.845 --> 17:26.281
To survive, yes.

17:26.316 --> 17:28.483
I am inside of her.

17:28.519 --> 17:32.254
I kept her alive. I protect her.

17:32.289 --> 17:36.058
But now I found you.

17:36.126 --> 17:39.061
Help us. Please.

17:43.066 --> 17:44.766
Okay, okay.

17:44.801 --> 17:47.602
Gonna give you another one, okay?

17:47.637 --> 17:49.270
Okay.

17:53.042 --> 17:55.376
There you go. You're doing great.

18:03.619 --> 18:06.921
Come on, kid. Come on.

18:06.956 --> 18:08.222
Sam?

18:08.257 --> 18:10.191
- Sam?
- Yeah?

18:10.225 --> 18:12.226
Just hang on, okay?

18:12.261 --> 18:16.364
[siren wails in distance]

18:16.398 --> 18:18.666
Hey, do you hear that?

18:18.733 --> 18:19.767
That's your ambulance.

18:19.801 --> 18:20.868
It's coming for you, okay, so just...

18:20.936 --> 18:22.336
you have to hang on a little bit longer.

18:22.370 --> 18:23.737
- Can you do that?
- Yeah.

18:23.772 --> 18:24.872
Okay, good.

18:24.906 --> 18:28.375
[siren continues]

18:28.409 --> 18:29.543
What do you got for me, man?

18:29.611 --> 18:31.078
I need you to pop this shoulder back in.

18:31.112 --> 18:33.647
An 83-year-old man with a dislocated scapula

18:33.715 --> 18:36.283
incurred during a tap dance here in the E.R.

18:36.317 --> 18:37.718
The E.R.?

18:39.854 --> 18:41.788
Wait a second. That's it.

18:41.856 --> 18:44.424
That's it. The scapula. Thank you so much.

18:44.459 --> 18:45.625
You are amazing.

18:45.659 --> 18:47.394
I know. So, are you gonna do this?

18:47.428 --> 18:49.529
Amazing. Thank you.

18:50.631 --> 18:52.966
Excuse me.

18:53.001 --> 18:55.101
Hey.

18:55.168 --> 18:56.703
The scapula.

18:56.737 --> 18:58.270
- What?
- The scapula's the thing, mate.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.306
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about Sou.

19:00.374 --> 19:03.376
We can rebuild that hard palate
by using a piece of her scapula.

19:03.410 --> 19:04.644
- Okay.
- Yeah.

19:04.678 --> 19:07.013
I mean, there's a chance
we can still operate.

19:07.047 --> 19:08.381
That's good.

19:08.415 --> 19:11.817
That's very good, because
we can't let this woman die.

19:11.851 --> 19:16.255
I don't know how you do it,
be around sick people all day.

19:16.289 --> 19:17.523
You get used to it.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.992
I don't know how you do what you do.

19:20.060 --> 19:22.861
Hmm. Everybody's born naked.

19:22.896 --> 19:25.864
It's actually kind of cool
when you strip it all away.

19:25.899 --> 19:27.833
You know, you just feel free.

19:29.402 --> 19:32.704
Hmm. Then why do you want to go
on worker's comp?

19:32.739 --> 19:34.673
I need to get out of that club.

19:34.707 --> 19:37.075
My last boyfriend, he bartends there.

19:37.109 --> 19:38.309
He ripped me off.

19:40.446 --> 19:43.982
Well, I don't see any masses
in the right lower quadrant.

19:44.017 --> 19:45.350
Is that good?

19:45.384 --> 19:47.485
Very good.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.954
[sighs]

19:49.988 --> 19:52.457
Yeah. He played me so bad.

19:52.491 --> 19:54.692
And then when I found out
he was doing the same thing

19:54.760 --> 19:55.927
with like three other girls,

19:55.961 --> 19:57.929
I dumped his ass, and he went nuts.

19:57.996 --> 19:59.664
He's basically been stalking me.

19:59.731 --> 20:01.799
- Geez.
- Yeah.

20:01.833 --> 20:03.701
Here, you can, uh, wipe that up.

20:03.735 --> 20:05.436
Sit up when you're done.
Everything's looking normal.

20:05.470 --> 20:06.503
Okay.

20:06.572 --> 20:07.905
It just sucks

20:07.940 --> 20:11.341
because I have to deal with him
on a nightly basis,

20:11.376 --> 20:13.177
which is why I really need out.

20:13.211 --> 20:14.445
- [vomits]
- Ohh.

20:14.512 --> 20:17.114
[coughs]

20:17.182 --> 20:18.515
You okay?

20:18.550 --> 20:20.050
Oh, my god. I'm so sorry.

20:20.085 --> 20:21.485
No, that's okay.

20:21.519 --> 20:24.521
I haven't had anything to drink
since last call, I swear.

20:27.525 --> 20:31.895
I need a full blood panel
and urinalysis, please, right now.

20:31.929 --> 20:33.597
What is wrong with me?

20:33.631 --> 20:34.864
I don't know.

20:34.899 --> 20:37.200
But we're gonna find out. It's okay.

20:37.234 --> 20:38.334
It's okay.

20:38.402 --> 20:41.304
These were my favorite shoes.

20:41.371 --> 20:43.873
I'm really sorry.

20:43.908 --> 20:47.077
[radio chatter]

20:58.388 --> 21:00.456
Can you take him for me?

21:00.491 --> 21:02.291
He needs two liters of crystalloid

21:02.326 --> 21:03.426
and some vasopressors.

21:03.460 --> 21:04.760
- Do you have that on your bus?
- Yeah.

21:04.828 --> 21:06.295
Okay, we'll use the pump
and run it as an infusion.

21:06.330 --> 21:07.630
He'll get that when we get him
to the hospital.

21:07.664 --> 21:09.231
- Which hospital?
- Mimico pediatric.

21:09.265 --> 21:10.899
No, you can't take him there.
They don't have the surgeons.

21:10.934 --> 21:13.268
He has a spinal injury
and serious internal bleeding.

21:13.336 --> 21:14.937
Lady, we're mandated by law
to take him to the nearest hospital.

21:14.971 --> 21:16.238
I'm not a lady. I'm a doctor.

21:16.272 --> 21:17.472
And I'm telling you,

21:17.540 --> 21:19.141
you can't take him to Mimico
because he'll die.

21:19.175 --> 21:20.175
[monitor beeping] We got trouble.

21:20.243 --> 21:23.478
What? Oh, he's in V-fib.

21:23.513 --> 21:24.613
Charge the paddles.

21:24.680 --> 21:26.581
Charging.

21:26.649 --> 21:29.083
[defibrillator whirring] 300 joules.

21:29.152 --> 21:30.418
- You ready?
- Charged.

21:30.453 --> 21:31.686
- Okay.
- Clear.

21:36.825 --> 21:38.860
No. No pulse.

21:38.894 --> 21:39.894
Again.

21:39.928 --> 21:42.730
[defibrillator whirring]

21:42.765 --> 21:44.465
- Clear.
- Yeah?

21:46.201 --> 21:47.802
[flatline]

21:47.870 --> 21:50.104
Come on, come on, come on.

21:50.139 --> 21:51.673
[monitor beeping steadily] [gasping]

21:51.707 --> 21:53.274
Okay, let's go, let's go!

21:53.308 --> 21:54.776
Sam, you're gonna be okay. All right?

21:54.810 --> 21:56.177
One, two, three.

21:56.244 --> 21:57.778
You're doing just fine.

21:57.812 --> 21:59.613
It's gonna be okay, Sam.

22:01.650 --> 22:03.384
[breathing heavily]

22:06.044 --> 22:08.746
So, Zach was talking about
the old guy's scapula,

22:08.780 --> 22:11.215
and it just hit me like a lightning bolt.

22:11.249 --> 22:14.752
Hmm. Oprah calls that the "aha" moment.

22:14.786 --> 22:17.221
What? She does.

22:17.255 --> 22:19.289
Anyway, I remember reading a paper

22:19.324 --> 22:21.959
by Dr. Gilbert and his team over
at Princess Margaret Hospital.

22:21.993 --> 22:24.127
Uh, they were harvesting
these pieces of scapula.

22:24.162 --> 22:26.864
And using them to replace
the hard palate after tumor removal,

22:26.898 --> 22:29.532
but we've never done that here
before, and this tumor is big.

22:29.567 --> 22:30.934
She is also older than I would recommend

22:31.002 --> 22:32.302
for such an extensive surgery, but...

22:32.337 --> 22:33.303
She's tough.

22:33.338 --> 22:34.738
She's tough.

22:34.772 --> 22:36.138
Now, the tumor is blocking the pharynx,

22:36.206 --> 22:38.423
so her breathing's
just gonna keep getting worse.

22:38.496 --> 22:40.610
But it hasn't metastasized
to her brain or her lungs, so...

22:40.644 --> 22:42.912
If we pull this off, she's got
an 80% chance of survival.

22:42.946 --> 22:44.180
Got one shot at this tumor.

22:45.724 --> 22:46.806
Got to get it all.

22:46.856 --> 22:48.174
We'll get it all.

22:48.224 --> 22:49.051
Look at you guys.

22:49.086 --> 22:52.889
You're like two peas in an... ortho-pod.

22:52.956 --> 22:53.956
[chuckling]

22:53.991 --> 22:55.457
Right?

22:55.492 --> 22:56.792
[chuckles]

22:56.860 --> 22:58.761
No? Okay.

22:58.795 --> 23:01.964
[siren wailing]

23:02.532 --> 23:04.433
Listen to me. You can't take him to Mimico.

23:04.467 --> 23:05.534
Lady, it's my job.

23:05.568 --> 23:07.002
I can't let you take this boy

23:07.036 --> 23:08.636
to a hospital that can't treat him.

23:08.704 --> 23:10.772
I'm not putting myself on the line for you.

23:10.806 --> 23:12.507
10875.

23:12.541 --> 23:13.674
What?

23:13.709 --> 23:14.842
10875.

23:14.877 --> 23:16.945
That's my medical college license number.

23:16.979 --> 23:18.846
Put it on the chart. He's my patient.

23:18.881 --> 23:20.448
[monitor beeping rapidly]

23:20.482 --> 23:22.850
His B.P.'s dropping. Come on.
Do the right thing here.

23:25.687 --> 23:27.354
Bro, we're going to Hope Zion.

23:29.157 --> 23:31.191
You're on the hook for this.

23:35.864 --> 23:38.365
What, uh... what are you looking at?

23:38.400 --> 23:39.901
I am looking at your new blood work,

23:39.935 --> 23:41.735
trying to figure out what is wrong with you.

23:41.769 --> 23:42.803
[chuckles]

23:42.837 --> 23:44.104
Any ideas?

23:44.139 --> 23:45.806
Not yet. You're a bit of a mystery.

23:45.840 --> 23:50.244
But I am here for 11 more hours, so...

23:50.278 --> 23:53.113
Don't got to tell me
about long shifts on your feet.

23:53.148 --> 23:55.082
At least you're not in platforms.

23:55.116 --> 23:56.984
[chuckles] Ah! Ohh.

23:57.018 --> 23:58.618
Is the pain getting worse?

23:58.686 --> 24:01.287
Yes. Aren't there any more tests
you can run?

24:01.322 --> 24:04.023
We've run all the tests.
You're a conundrum here.

24:04.058 --> 24:05.158
Oh. Okay.

24:05.225 --> 24:07.494
Well, I'm gonna take that as a compliment.

24:07.528 --> 24:09.095
As long as it doesn't mean "slut."

24:09.129 --> 24:10.964
It doesn't. Are your eyes sore?

24:11.031 --> 24:13.399
Yeah, my vision is getting kind of blurry.

24:13.434 --> 24:15.168
How blurry?

24:15.235 --> 24:19.339
Um, pretty bad, actually.
Maybe I need a new prescription.

24:19.406 --> 24:21.174
What were you drinking last night?

24:21.208 --> 24:23.242
Oh. You'll laugh if I tell you.

24:23.277 --> 24:24.877
Tell me. It's important.

24:24.911 --> 24:26.379
- Blue moons.
- What's in that?

24:26.413 --> 24:28.181
Irish cream, blue curacao, and grenadine.

24:28.215 --> 24:30.149
It's kind of my thing.
All my regulars know it.

24:30.217 --> 24:32.250
- How many of those did you drink?
- I don't know.

24:32.285 --> 24:33.853
It was a busy night.

24:33.887 --> 24:35.554
- Why?
- Jackson!

24:37.724 --> 24:38.924
Why do you always yell at me?

24:38.959 --> 24:40.025
I don't know.

24:40.093 --> 24:41.093
I need you to run a full blood panel

24:41.127 --> 24:42.461
and check for methanol poisoning.

24:42.496 --> 24:43.696
- I'm on it.
- Thank you.

24:43.763 --> 24:45.197
What poisoning?

24:45.264 --> 24:47.265
I'm afraid your ex-boyfriend
might have tried poisoning you.

24:47.300 --> 24:48.400
What?

24:48.468 --> 24:49.868
Blue curacao is a lot like antifreeze.

24:49.935 --> 24:51.470
Wouldn't... wouldn't I have tasted it?

24:51.504 --> 24:52.637
Methanol is very sweet,

24:52.671 --> 24:53.838
and mixed with something like grenadine,

24:53.873 --> 24:55.107
you wouldn't have even known the difference.

24:55.141 --> 24:56.208
- Oh, my god.
Zach: - Okay, you know what else?

24:56.242 --> 24:57.509
We got to get her on a bicarb I.V.,

24:57.576 --> 24:58.743
And let's get an ethanol drip.

24:58.811 --> 25:00.445
- We don't have one.
- What?

25:00.480 --> 25:02.814
Methanol poisoning is rare.
We don't stock an ethanol drip.

25:02.848 --> 25:04.649
Well, th... what are you gonna do?

25:04.683 --> 25:06.818
- No, don't walk away.
- It's okay. It's okay.

25:06.852 --> 25:08.085
Look, we don't have a lot of time

25:08.120 --> 25:09.554
before she's in fulminant liver failure.

25:09.622 --> 25:10.788
I need you to call General

25:10.823 --> 25:12.223
and find out if they have an ethanol drip.

25:12.257 --> 25:13.591
- Yeah, I'm on it.
- Thank you.

25:15.528 --> 25:17.361
Am I gonna die?

25:19.865 --> 25:21.499
No, you are not.

25:23.801 --> 25:25.436
Alex: He's got massive internal bleeding.

25:25.470 --> 25:26.737
My guess is he's got two liters of blood

25:26.771 --> 25:28.039
pooling in his abdomen.

25:28.106 --> 25:29.940
Okay, well, let's decompress
his spine immediately.

25:29.974 --> 25:31.008
Uh, what's his B.P.?

25:31.043 --> 25:32.176
90 over 70.

25:32.210 --> 25:33.444
I've got to find that bleeder and stop it

25:33.512 --> 25:34.578
or he's gonna bleed out.

25:34.612 --> 25:35.779
Okay, we'll stabilize

25:35.813 --> 25:36.947
and I'll take care of his spine afterwards.

25:37.015 --> 25:38.615
- He'll be paralyzed.
- Maybe.

25:38.650 --> 25:39.850
That's not good enough.

25:39.918 --> 25:41.518
What if I can get you
to his spinal fracture?

25:41.553 --> 25:43.486
Could you decompress
from an anterior approach?

25:43.521 --> 25:44.888
- Go in through the front?
- Yeah.

25:44.923 --> 25:45.966
I'll nip whatever bleeders I can find,

25:46.039 --> 25:47.193
shove the guts aside.

25:47.283 --> 25:49.593
You throw in a cage and stabilize the spine.

25:49.627 --> 25:51.294
It's practically orthopedic.

25:51.328 --> 25:53.596
Learned from the best. What do you think?

25:53.630 --> 25:54.864
Okay, let's give it a shot.

25:54.898 --> 25:56.399
Why don't you go get changed,
and I'll prep him?

25:56.467 --> 25:58.068
Okay.

26:04.007 --> 26:05.708
- Hey, Dr. Goran.
- Yeah.

26:05.776 --> 26:08.844
There's an urgent call for you
from an Elizabeth Clayton.

26:08.879 --> 26:10.145
Of course it is.

26:10.213 --> 26:12.281
- My lawyer.
- The verdict must be in.

26:12.315 --> 26:13.783
I should probably take it.

26:13.817 --> 26:15.685
Hey, I can't do this without you, man.

26:19.222 --> 26:22.692
Tell Miss Clayton
I'm gonna have to call her back.

26:22.726 --> 26:24.694
Heading into surgery.

26:30.149 --> 26:33.752
[monitor beeping, ventilator hissing]

26:36.055 --> 26:38.990
Yeah, kid's lucky that you found him.

26:39.025 --> 26:41.158
Or unlucky that a tree fell on him.

26:41.193 --> 26:42.492
[chuckles]

26:42.560 --> 26:44.929
Yeah, I don't think that I can have kids.

26:44.963 --> 26:47.031
I'd literally worry all the time.

26:49.067 --> 26:50.434
Yeah.

26:50.468 --> 26:52.336
You okay?

26:52.403 --> 26:56.606
You look a little, uh, papery over there.

26:56.641 --> 26:59.710
Probably just dehydrated.

26:59.777 --> 27:01.445
Okay.

27:01.512 --> 27:02.713
All right.

27:02.780 --> 27:04.548
I think I've got everything.
What do you think?

27:04.582 --> 27:06.483
Looks... looks-looks very good.

27:06.517 --> 27:07.617
Okay. We're done here.

27:08.953 --> 27:10.554
Shahir, you're up.

27:10.588 --> 27:11.955
Okay. Let's go.

27:11.989 --> 27:14.757
Get me the corpectomy tray
and the spine microscope.

27:18.462 --> 27:20.496
[sighs]

27:22.499 --> 27:23.833
[sighs]

27:27.338 --> 27:28.872
Dr. Katz.

27:28.906 --> 27:30.138
Dr. Hamza called me.

27:30.173 --> 27:31.139
About?

27:31.174 --> 27:32.408
Your adventurous day.

27:32.442 --> 27:33.609
Well, I am totally fine,

27:33.643 --> 27:35.711
and I like to stick with my patients, so...

27:35.779 --> 27:36.979
Yeah, so do I.

27:37.046 --> 27:38.547
And I have two patients...
you and your baby.

27:38.582 --> 27:40.082
You stressed yourself all day
against my orders.

27:40.149 --> 27:41.316
I'd like to do a biometrical scan.

27:41.351 --> 27:43.051
Okay.

27:43.119 --> 27:46.755
Okay. So finish up. See you in 10.

27:48.925 --> 27:50.959
[sighs]

27:51.027 --> 27:53.195
Zach: Okay.

27:53.263 --> 27:56.098
So, we tracked down
an ethanol drip from St. Mo's.

27:56.165 --> 27:57.199
That's good news.

27:57.233 --> 27:59.067
But it's coming by ambulance,

27:59.102 --> 28:00.802
and it's gonna take
about 20 minutes to get here,

28:00.870 --> 28:02.670
so in the meantime,
I need you to drink some vodka.

28:02.705 --> 28:03.705
Don't joke.

28:03.739 --> 28:04.972
I'm not joking.

28:05.007 --> 28:06.708
Your liver might metabolize the vodka

28:06.776 --> 28:07.876
instead of the methanol.

28:07.910 --> 28:08.910
What?

28:08.944 --> 28:10.412
I don't get it.

28:10.479 --> 28:11.813
Okay, listen.

28:11.847 --> 28:13.214
If you drink this vodka,

28:13.248 --> 28:16.050
your liver should ignore
the antifreeze you drank

28:16.084 --> 28:17.886
and absorb the vodka instead.

28:17.920 --> 28:20.754
Vodka will save your life.
Just drink it. Trust me.

28:20.789 --> 28:22.456
Yes, sir.

28:25.427 --> 28:27.861
Oh!

28:27.896 --> 28:28.963
Oh, my god.

28:28.997 --> 28:31.132
I cannot believe he did this to me.

28:31.199 --> 28:34.302
I mean, I knew he was psycho,
but this is some serious bull...

28:34.369 --> 28:36.236
Less talking, more drinking.

28:38.740 --> 28:40.641
Ohh!

28:40.675 --> 28:43.009
Are you gonna have any of that?

28:43.044 --> 28:45.145
I wish.

28:45.212 --> 28:47.548
But I can't.

28:47.582 --> 28:49.316
What are you so worried about?

28:49.350 --> 28:51.652
Hmm.

28:51.686 --> 28:52.785
In my line of work,

28:52.853 --> 28:54.754
you get pretty good at reading people.

28:54.822 --> 28:57.223
Drink.

29:02.296 --> 29:04.197
Ahh.

29:04.231 --> 29:07.167
You should tell me your problem.

29:07.201 --> 29:08.534
Maybe I can help you.

29:12.238 --> 29:14.807
I think I might have prostate cancer.

29:14.842 --> 29:17.042
Oh.

29:17.077 --> 29:18.878
Aren't you a little young?

29:18.946 --> 29:21.781
Yes. I am.

29:21.815 --> 29:23.916
Huh.

29:23.951 --> 29:26.751
So, when will you know?

29:26.819 --> 29:32.891
Well, I had this horribly
painful biopsy 48 hours ago,

29:32.925 --> 29:35.861
and now I'm just kind of waiting
around for the results.

29:37.830 --> 29:41.666
So, if you have it, you can't, uh...

29:41.701 --> 29:44.503
Yeah.

29:44.570 --> 29:45.971
But that's okay, though.

29:46.005 --> 29:48.940
I mean, there's lots
of other stuff that you can do.

29:48.975 --> 29:51.075
It's not all about the hard penis.

29:51.143 --> 29:54.813
It sort of is. And...

29:54.847 --> 29:57.348
I can't even believe I'm having
this conversation with you.

29:57.416 --> 29:58.483
[chuckles]

29:58.517 --> 30:02.020
Hmm. So, you're like me.

30:05.224 --> 30:06.957
You might die, too.

30:12.898 --> 30:15.399
[monitor beeping, instrument whirring]

30:21.039 --> 30:23.774
That is one gnarly-looking tumor.

30:23.808 --> 30:25.308
Absolutely.

30:25.343 --> 30:26.877
A few more cuts and I should...

30:26.945 --> 30:28.612
- Don't you say it.
- Ready to rock 'n' roll.

30:28.680 --> 30:30.213
What? Are you a little
superstitious there, Charlie?

30:30.248 --> 30:32.516
- Eyes on the prize, Joel.
- All right.

30:35.453 --> 30:36.986
Oh.

30:37.021 --> 30:39.622
You've got to be kidding me. Damn it.

30:39.657 --> 30:40.957
Where is all that blood coming from?

30:41.025 --> 30:42.759
- I hit a bleeder in there.
- Yep.

30:42.793 --> 30:43.927
I mean, I've got to be miles away

30:43.961 --> 30:45.728
from the greater palatine artery in there.

30:45.763 --> 30:47.064
Um, bipolar cautery, please.

30:47.098 --> 30:49.532
Thank you.

30:49.567 --> 30:50.967
Look at that.

30:51.001 --> 30:52.201
All of those blood vessels

30:52.235 --> 30:53.903
feeding directly into that tumor.

30:53.938 --> 30:57.173
This thing has really got
its hooks in there, man.

30:58.542 --> 31:00.743
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What is it?

31:00.778 --> 31:02.946
There's still some mass
in the maxillary sinus.

31:02.980 --> 31:05.314
Right... there.

31:05.382 --> 31:07.249
Uh, okay.

31:07.284 --> 31:09.418
This thing just doesn't want
to budge anywhere.

31:09.453 --> 31:11.687
Try dissecting between
the pseudocapsule and the normal tissue.

31:11.721 --> 31:13.456
You got it.

31:13.523 --> 31:15.291
There we are.

31:15.325 --> 31:17.759
- Beautiful.
- Yeah.

31:17.794 --> 31:19.328
Yes.

31:19.396 --> 31:21.262
[sighs]

31:21.297 --> 31:23.164
Okay, does that look like
a negative margin to you?

31:23.199 --> 31:24.466
Best I can tell.

31:24.500 --> 31:25.667
Okay.

31:25.702 --> 31:27.235
Hopefully we got it all,

31:27.303 --> 31:28.937
otherwise this whole thing
would have been for nothing.

31:29.005 --> 31:31.372
Get that to pathology and get
a stat frozen section for me.

31:31.407 --> 31:33.541
All right, ladies and gents,
let's get her flipped,

31:40.549 --> 31:41.616
Oh, great.

31:41.650 --> 31:43.851
Um, go hook it up to Bernice's I.V.

31:43.885 --> 31:46.321
And, uh, get her another bolus
of saline and some bicarb, too.

31:46.355 --> 31:49.424
Sure. Uh, the lab just handed me
these biopsy tests results

31:49.492 --> 31:50.725
for a Frank Kassabian.

31:50.759 --> 31:51.859
I'll take those.

31:51.927 --> 31:53.027
I couldn't find Mr. Kassabian's chart.

31:53.061 --> 31:55.062
That's good. I got it.

32:15.450 --> 32:17.717

32:40.041 --> 32:43.842
Okay. I can see the head.

32:43.910 --> 32:45.478
Yeah.

32:45.512 --> 32:48.747
It looks... like a head.

32:48.782 --> 32:50.216
A healthy head.

32:50.250 --> 32:53.686
You see the, uh, little heart beating there?

32:53.753 --> 32:55.421
Oh, yeah.

All there in the right places,
functioning nicely.

33:18.511 --> 33:19.944

33:19.978 --> 33:23.448
Because I'm a couple weeks late
for my 20-week scan, so...

Oy. Yeah. It's a boy.

- Yes.

- Nigel, get to the point!

You cut it close,
but congratulations, gentlemen.

34:34.050 --> 34:35.150
You took out the entire tumor.

34:35.185 --> 34:36.485

- It's my lawyer.

Good work in there today.

41:49.898 --> 41:52.065
Oh, thank you. You, too.

41:52.100 --> 41:54.101
You know, you made some
very good calls along the way.

41:54.135 --> 41:56.269
[sighs]

41:56.303 --> 41:58.070
Did you want a bite of my muffin?

41:58.138 --> 41:59.539
No.

42:01.475 --> 42:03.410
I'm having a boy, Shahir.

42:05.379 --> 42:07.246
Congratulations. That's amazing.

42:07.314 --> 42:09.449
[chuckles]

42:09.517 --> 42:10.445
Yeah.

42:10.495 --> 42:11.983
What are you gonna do
about the whole "no father" thing?

42:12.019 --> 42:15.087
Um...

42:15.155 --> 42:17.290
I... you know, I'm just
taking it one day at a time.

42:19.293 --> 42:21.827
I'll do it.

42:21.861 --> 42:23.129
What?

42:23.163 --> 42:24.563
Mm-hmm.

42:24.597 --> 42:27.900
Until you have the baby and
you can have a paternity test,

42:27.934 --> 42:29.267
if it's what you want.

42:29.302 --> 42:30.869
Are you serious?

42:30.937 --> 42:32.003
Sure.

42:32.038 --> 42:33.672
I'll do all the male-type things.

42:33.706 --> 42:35.741
I'll-I'll come to lamaze class with you.

42:35.775 --> 42:38.243
Actually, I was thinking
of doing hypnobirthing.

42:38.311 --> 42:40.245
That's very flaky.

42:41.648 --> 42:42.915
But I'll come.

42:42.949 --> 42:44.015
Really?

42:44.050 --> 42:46.617
Mm-hmm. Unless you want someone else.
