WEBVTT

01:12.760 --> 01:14.911
Uh... Why irregular?

01:15.000 --> 01:17.993
They put a ladies' sock
in there with the gents'.

01:19.680 --> 01:20.750
Which one's which?

01:21.680 --> 01:23.512
It's unclear.
Ah.

01:25.160 --> 01:26.560
Eh. I'll roll the dice.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.320
Uh, how much?

01:29.840 --> 01:31.160
You tell me.

01:32.600 --> 01:33.590
Say again?

01:33.680 --> 01:36.957
The sign says, "best offer."
What're you offering?

01:37.040 --> 01:38.030
Well, I mean...

01:39.600 --> 01:41.353
I don't know.
What's fair?

01:41.440 --> 01:43.193
Well, that's not
for me to say.

01:43.280 --> 01:46.717
It's three pairs of socks.
Half of them ladies'.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.156
Probably not
a million dollars.

01:50.120 --> 01:52.077
Uh...

01:52.520 --> 01:56.036
Well, I... I mean,
I don't wanna take advantage.

01:58.360 --> 01:59.794
2 bucks?

02:04.880 --> 02:06.394
Or if that's...

02:08.240 --> 02:09.356
3 bucks?

02:14.480 --> 02:15.596
5.

02:16.400 --> 02:20.030
Tell you what,
you give me $55,
I'll give you the socks...

02:21.040 --> 02:23.191
and throw in this 12 gauge.

02:35.720 --> 02:38.315
I thought you
were getting socks.

02:38.400 --> 02:39.390
In the bag.

02:40.520 --> 02:42.671
What the heck are
you gonna do with that?

02:42.760 --> 02:44.911
It's for protection.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.992
Just be careful
you don't blow
your own face off.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.514
Not loaded, is it?

02:48.600 --> 02:50.273
Well, if anyone
could shoot theirselves

02:50.360 --> 02:51.999
in the face with
an unloaded firearm,

02:52.080 --> 02:53.355
it's you.

03:16.480 --> 03:17.630
Lester?

03:17.800 --> 03:18.995
Yeah!

03:24.280 --> 03:25.270
Ah...

03:41.480 --> 03:42.550
<i>Yeah?</i>

03:42.640 --> 03:44.040
<i>My wife...</i>

03:44.160 --> 03:46.117
<i>she's in the basement
dead and...</i>

03:46.200 --> 03:48.635
<i>I'm freaking out here.
I don't know what to do.</i>

03:48.720 --> 03:51.394
<i>Lester, have you
been a bad boy?</i>

03:53.000 --> 03:55.640
<i>Jeez. Yeah.</i>

03:55.720 --> 03:57.393
<i>Can you come over?</i>

03:59.560 --> 04:01.153
What did you do?

04:02.600 --> 04:04.159
You killed her!

04:09.360 --> 04:11.238
Okay. Okay.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.753
Evening, Lester.

04:28.840 --> 04:30.593
What...
what do you want?

04:30.680 --> 04:33.957
Well, I suppose first
I'd like to come in.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.952
Is Pearl home?
No.

04:36.040 --> 04:38.032
No, she's at my brother's.

04:40.040 --> 04:42.953
Lester, listen
to me very carefully.

04:43.040 --> 04:44.554
I need you to get
down on the ground.

04:44.680 --> 04:46.273
Now, wait...
wait just a second.

04:46.360 --> 04:47.919
Lester, on the ground!

04:48.000 --> 04:49.275
This is not
what it looks like.

06:00.280 --> 06:01.953
Look, I'm sorry...

06:04.000 --> 06:05.400
about...

06:05.480 --> 06:06.800
about electrocuting you.

06:06.880 --> 06:08.155
I was just...

06:09.120 --> 06:11.237
I mean,
this is obviously...

06:12.440 --> 06:14.193
a misunderstanding.

06:14.280 --> 06:16.715
'Cause, like...
like I said...

06:16.800 --> 06:20.476
I'm just...
an insurance salesman.

06:21.280 --> 06:24.671
Now that is not...
I... I got nothing...

06:24.760 --> 06:27.753
The stuff that
you're mixed up in...
Not that you're...

06:27.840 --> 06:29.752
I'm just saying... Well...

06:30.720 --> 06:32.154
So, you see?

06:42.320 --> 06:44.073
You said, "him."

06:44.160 --> 06:45.276
What?

06:45.360 --> 06:48.558
On the ice,
you said... "him."

06:48.640 --> 06:49.994
You said it was "him."

06:51.000 --> 06:52.320
Not you...

06:53.400 --> 06:54.595
"him."

06:55.920 --> 06:56.990
Yeah.

06:59.320 --> 07:02.313
Well... well, I'm just
guessing here, but...

07:02.440 --> 07:04.671
Well, that Hess was not
head stabbed by a girl.

07:04.760 --> 07:07.514
No, no.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.717
No, you said it
like you had a face in mind.

07:11.200 --> 07:12.316
Uh-uh.

07:16.520 --> 07:17.920
No, wait...

07:25.840 --> 07:27.354
Stay with me.
Lester, stay with me.

07:27.440 --> 07:28.954
God. Please, please...

07:29.040 --> 07:30.360
I need a name.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.078
I need a name.

07:34.280 --> 07:35.270
Go ahead.

07:35.400 --> 07:36.390
Wait! Please!

07:36.480 --> 07:37.630
Wait.

07:38.880 --> 07:39.950
God.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.995
Lester...
No! Malvo. Malvo.

07:45.680 --> 07:47.956
Malvo? Is that a first name?

07:52.080 --> 07:53.070
Lester,

07:53.200 --> 07:55.476
eventually, you just
swallow your tongue

07:55.560 --> 07:56.630
and you die like a fish.

07:56.720 --> 07:58.632
Lorne... I think.

07:58.720 --> 08:01.155
Lorne like
the fella from <i>Bonanza.</i>

08:01.240 --> 08:02.640
Lorne Malvo?

08:07.560 --> 08:08.550
Where is he?

08:08.640 --> 08:09.676
I'm gonna throw up.

08:09.800 --> 08:10.790
No.

08:10.880 --> 08:11.950
No, you're not.

08:12.040 --> 08:13.474
If you puke in here,
I'll kill you.

08:13.560 --> 08:14.914
I mean,
I'll actually kill you.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.719
Okay.
Okay?

08:17.600 --> 08:19.910
Lester, we need a location.

08:20.000 --> 08:20.990
Location...

08:22.600 --> 08:24.910
He took... he took my car.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.516
They called me and told me
it was impounded in Duluth.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.159
So he's probably...

08:30.280 --> 08:31.316
I think...
They got a picture...

08:31.400 --> 08:33.437
There's a picture of him...
a picture of him up here.

08:33.520 --> 08:35.477
Yeah, it's from
the law enforcement...
He had it. It's from a...

08:35.559 --> 08:38.280
What do you call it?
An APB. So...

08:41.679 --> 08:43.159
What?

08:45.360 --> 08:48.353
Lorne Malvo? Yeah?

08:48.440 --> 08:50.636
He killed him.
He killed Hess.

08:50.720 --> 08:52.279
I mean...

08:54.280 --> 08:55.270
Okay.

08:56.080 --> 08:58.675
You two are free to go.
Bail's been paid.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.029
Oh, God.

09:02.120 --> 09:03.713
What if we wanna stay?

09:03.800 --> 09:05.075
Pardon?

09:05.880 --> 09:08.440
I don't know.
I mean, what if
we like it here?

09:08.520 --> 09:11.638
Yeah... that's a good one.
On your feet.

09:11.720 --> 09:13.712
You have any doubt
we can find you?

09:13.800 --> 09:14.836
No.

09:18.880 --> 09:21.793
Hey, buddy, you might
wanna have a doctor look
at that hand though.

09:21.880 --> 09:23.678
Looks like it smarts.

09:38.680 --> 09:41.240
<i>...some of
the largest snakes
found in the world.</i>

09:41.320 --> 09:44.392
<i>Many members of
the python family
are ambush predators.</i>

09:44.520 --> 09:47.592
<i>They remain motionless
before they strike.</i>

09:47.680 --> 09:49.399
<i>It's not common
for them to attack humans,</i>

09:49.480 --> 09:51.073
<i>unless, of course,
they're startled.</i>

09:51.160 --> 09:54.949
<i>Now, advancements
in the technological
arena allow us</i>

09:55.040 --> 09:57.760
<i>to examine their existence
in the Everglades.</i>

09:57.840 --> 09:58.830
<i>Now look ahead, they're...</i>

09:58.920 --> 10:00.559
No way around it.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.274
I said more sand.

10:08.360 --> 10:09.430
Back then?

10:09.520 --> 10:10.954
Yeah, wild goose chase.

10:11.040 --> 10:12.440
Salt's okay.

10:12.520 --> 10:14.193
Hang on. Frank calling.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.034
Well, Chief,
there've been some
interesting developments

10:17.120 --> 10:18.440
while you were...
Chief, Frank on the line.

10:18.520 --> 10:20.113
New storm data.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.078
Yeah, Frank.
What you got then?

10:22.160 --> 10:24.391
This case is really...
It's heating up.

10:24.480 --> 10:26.756
That much, huh? Jeez.

10:26.840 --> 10:29.639
They're saying 2 feet
new accumulation.

10:29.720 --> 10:32.110
So...
we got the phone dump back

10:32.200 --> 10:33.839
from Lester's from
the night of the murders.

10:33.920 --> 10:36.594
Okay, thanks much.
You, too.

10:36.680 --> 10:39.195
Call Hoenecker with State,
see if we can get
some more plows,

10:39.280 --> 10:42.637
and, uh, make sure they're
plowing the Chief's drive
every few hours.

10:42.720 --> 10:45.554
Can't have Ida
going into labor under
a snowbound scenario.

10:45.640 --> 10:46.710
Okay, yeah.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.314
Now, what's all this?

10:48.400 --> 10:50.198
I was saying,
we got the phone dump back,

10:50.280 --> 10:52.033
and right around
the time Pearl died,

10:52.120 --> 10:55.158
an outgoing call was
placed from Lester's
to Leroy's Motor Inn.

10:55.240 --> 10:57.277
So I made a call.
No one asked you to.

10:57.360 --> 10:59.158
I know, but you were
in Duluth, so I figured...

10:59.240 --> 11:01.311
Left Knutson in charge.
Right.

11:01.400 --> 11:05.679
So I made a call...
and get this, Lorraine,
the manager--

11:05.760 --> 11:07.513
Lorraine Abbey?

11:07.600 --> 11:10.195
No, sir, Lorraine Babbit.

11:10.280 --> 11:14.035
Curly hair... looks like
she draws her eyebrows
on with a Sharpie?

11:14.120 --> 11:17.397
No, sir,
this is a severe
woman with hard hair.

11:17.480 --> 11:19.437
Anyway, she IDs
the photo of the suspect

11:19.520 --> 11:21.398
from the naked
fella kidnapping.

11:21.480 --> 11:24.837
Says he stayed
one night, that being
the night Hess was killed.

11:24.920 --> 11:27.719
She got a name for
him, too. Lorne Malvo.

11:28.600 --> 11:29.636
And you found this how?

11:29.760 --> 11:30.830
Like I said...

11:30.960 --> 11:32.189
a call was placed
from Lester's house

11:32.280 --> 11:34.317
to the motel where
the suspect was staying.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.232
So, I talked to housekeeping

11:36.320 --> 11:38.039
and they say this
Malvo fella left behind

11:38.120 --> 11:39.190
some tokens from
the Lucky Penny.

11:39.280 --> 11:41.636
They wanna know
how many plows.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.353
At least three,
don't you think?

11:44.440 --> 11:45.999
At least three.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.834
He says he can
give you two good ones
and a pickup with baby plow.

11:49.920 --> 11:51.991
Sir.
Yeah, I'm listening.

11:52.080 --> 11:53.070
Okay, good.

11:53.160 --> 11:56.437
So I go and talk to
the lady that Hess
was with, the dancer,

11:56.520 --> 11:58.591
and she says that
before he was stabbed,

11:58.680 --> 12:00.911
Hess was laughing
about this fella
that he bullied.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.480
Broke the poor
guy's nose, she said.

12:02.560 --> 12:03.994
The same day.

12:04.080 --> 12:05.753
Chief?
Is that a yes
on the baby plow?

12:05.840 --> 12:07.513
So right away,
I'm thinking,

12:07.600 --> 12:11.435
"Who do we know
who got his nose broke
the day Hess died?"

12:11.520 --> 12:13.000
Lester.
Wait.

12:13.120 --> 12:15.191
Chief?
So you see?

12:15.280 --> 12:17.511
Hess breaks Lester's nose.

12:17.600 --> 12:20.957
Lester goes to
the emergency room
where he meets our suspect.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.191
That night
Hess gets killed.

12:23.280 --> 12:24.236
The next day,

12:24.320 --> 12:27.358
Lester places a call
to the motel where
our suspect is staying,

12:27.440 --> 12:29.079
and shortly
thereafter or abouts,

12:29.200 --> 12:30.873
Mrs. Nygaard and
the Chief are murdered.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.235
Chief?

12:32.320 --> 12:34.118
Yeah, tell him
I'll call him back.

12:35.280 --> 12:36.953
He's gotta call you back.

12:37.040 --> 12:38.554
Son of a bitch.

12:38.640 --> 12:39.960
Yes, sir.

12:40.040 --> 12:43.112
So I'm thinking maybe
this is a murder-for-hire
type deal, right?

12:43.240 --> 12:46.472
Where Lester hires this
Malvo fella to kill Hess.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.711
Only maybe Lester
don't got the money to pay

12:48.800 --> 12:50.871
so things get sour.

12:50.960 --> 12:53.794
Listen, I know
it's not my case...

12:53.880 --> 12:54.870
but I'd like your permission

12:55.000 --> 12:57.879
to go back to Lester's house
and see what he has to say.

12:59.240 --> 13:00.993
Not at his house.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.992
Okay, his work then.

13:03.080 --> 13:06.790
No... I'm saying,
he's not at his house.
He's in a holding cell.

13:06.880 --> 13:09.395
Knutson says Lester
took a swing at him.

13:09.480 --> 13:10.800
Not sure if he
was drunk or what.

13:10.880 --> 13:11.870
He's in custody?

13:11.960 --> 13:13.599
I told Dougie to
keep him overnight,

13:13.720 --> 13:15.359
you know,
let him sleep it off.

13:15.480 --> 13:18.917
Well... I mean,
we gotta talk to him,
don't you think?

13:20.240 --> 13:22.038
I guess we'd better.

13:34.600 --> 13:36.592
I need to use your computer.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.080
Yeah.

13:45.840 --> 13:46.956
It's on the front.

13:49.480 --> 13:52.917
Computers at the precinct...
have it on the back.

13:55.080 --> 13:56.594
Here, let me.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.558
What do you need?

14:07.640 --> 14:11.634
There's a pastor
up in Baudette.
Name of Frank Peterson.

14:16.760 --> 14:19.150
A few hits.

14:19.240 --> 14:21.038
A church website...

14:21.120 --> 14:22.679
some stuff from
the local paper.

14:22.760 --> 14:24.638
There anything
with a picture?

14:28.800 --> 14:30.075
Uffda.

14:31.280 --> 14:32.509
What's this for?

14:32.680 --> 14:33.875
A case.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.395
You said there were
other news stories.

14:36.520 --> 14:38.034
Nothing with a picture.

14:38.120 --> 14:39.873
Church fundraiser...

14:40.840 --> 14:43.116
new roof...
that kind of thing.

14:45.080 --> 14:48.790
Check for, uh, Lorne Malvo.
Could you check...

14:54.000 --> 14:55.480
Nothing.
Okay.

14:57.160 --> 15:00.471
He steals a car.
I pull him over.

15:00.560 --> 15:03.758
He drives away.
The car is impounded.

15:03.880 --> 15:05.633
He stays in Duluth.

15:07.760 --> 15:11.197
He stays in Duluth.
I stop him on the street.

15:11.280 --> 15:12.839
On that street.

15:15.280 --> 15:16.475
On foot.

15:17.280 --> 15:19.476
He was on
that street on foot.

15:19.560 --> 15:21.517
<i>Come in, Greta. Over.</i>

15:21.600 --> 15:24.434
Why was he on
that street on foot?

15:24.520 --> 15:25.636
Dad.

15:25.720 --> 15:27.313
<i>Greta, come in, Greta.</i>
Do you wanna...

15:27.400 --> 15:28.470
Oh, right.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.231
Okay. It's almost bedtime.

15:31.320 --> 15:33.710
And, hey...
I may go out for a bit.

15:33.800 --> 15:34.916
Okay.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.070
Come in. Over.

15:39.240 --> 15:40.515
Back for more, huh?

15:40.600 --> 15:42.080
I need a police scanner.

15:42.160 --> 15:44.197
Got a special on
remote control helicopters.

15:45.520 --> 15:47.830
Can you monitor
police activity on it?

15:47.920 --> 15:49.036
Doubt it.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.280
I'll just stick
with the scanner.

15:51.360 --> 15:52.680
Okay.

15:52.760 --> 15:56.800
I got handheld or
dashboard mountable.
Oh. Also...

15:58.000 --> 16:00.196
got this one in pink.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.515
Do I look like I want
a pink police scanner?

16:04.280 --> 16:05.509
I don't know.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.910
Could be a gift for a lady.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.559
And in your experience...

16:10.760 --> 16:13.400
police scanners,
is that a gift
ladies get wet for?

16:13.480 --> 16:14.800
Had an aunt once,

16:14.880 --> 16:17.315
owned a riot shield...
made her own jerky...

16:17.400 --> 16:18.880
I'll just stick
with the black.

16:19.880 --> 16:20.870
Okay.

16:21.600 --> 16:22.795
Anything else?

16:22.880 --> 16:24.200
Yeah,
I need a walkie-talkie.

16:24.280 --> 16:25.873
Yeah...

16:26.600 --> 16:29.160
afraid I can't just
sell you one, stretch.

16:29.240 --> 16:33.234
You see, they come in pairs...
you know, so you can
chat with a friend.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.033
I don't have any friends.

16:36.800 --> 16:38.473
It's a sad story.

16:38.600 --> 16:41.354
I still gotta
sell you two. Hey...

16:41.440 --> 16:44.831
maybe you could make
a friend and give it to him.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.151
Maybe I could
give it to you...

16:47.240 --> 16:51.757
call you up late at night
and you can listen
to me shit on people.

17:01.080 --> 17:03.037
Oh.
Where's your phone?

17:03.120 --> 17:05.680
What are you...
Are you supposed to be here?

17:05.760 --> 17:06.989
The phone?

17:07.079 --> 17:09.595
Yeah, in the...
in the kitchen.

17:14.960 --> 17:15.950
Uh...

17:17.200 --> 17:19.271
What's going on?

17:20.200 --> 17:21.190
What's that?

17:21.960 --> 17:23.598
Don't talk.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.430
Are you calling him?

17:29.520 --> 17:30.636
I said don't talk.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.790
This is exciting.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.197
Yeah.
<i>Let me talk to him.</i>

17:52.960 --> 17:53.950
Where were you?

17:54.040 --> 17:55.076
<i>I was hunting.</i>

17:55.160 --> 17:57.516
<i>I heard about the bugs.
Do you need me to swing by?</i>

17:57.600 --> 17:58.556
It's too late now.

17:58.680 --> 18:01.149
I'm gonna pay.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.640
The blackmail,
I'm gonna pay it.

18:02.720 --> 18:04.439
<i>Tell me what he said.</i>

18:04.560 --> 18:06.199
It doesn't matter now.

18:06.280 --> 18:08.192
I broke a promise.

18:08.280 --> 18:10.749
Me. So I gotta pay.

18:10.840 --> 18:13.753
Look, I can find the guy.
I just need a few more days.

18:13.840 --> 18:18.676
I couldn't sleep last night.
I kept going over
and over it in my head.

18:18.760 --> 18:22.151
And God brought 10 plagues
upon the house of Pharaoh.

18:24.320 --> 18:27.518
<i>Blood and locusts...
flies and boils.</i>

18:28.360 --> 18:30.716
And the last is the death
of the firstborn son.

18:31.520 --> 18:33.477
What exactly do you
think is happening?

18:33.560 --> 18:35.597
The firstborn son.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.353
<i>The Book of Exodus.</i>

18:37.440 --> 18:39.079
<i>God is watching
and He knows.</i>

18:39.160 --> 18:40.196
Knows what?

18:40.960 --> 18:41.950
I told Semenko

18:42.040 --> 18:43.838
to take Dmitri someplace safe
until this all blows over.

18:43.920 --> 18:45.513
He thinks I'm crazy.
Do you think I'm crazy?

18:46.840 --> 18:49.196
We're only as good
as the promises we keep.

18:53.360 --> 18:54.919
Pick me up in an hour.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.759
We'll get
the money.
<i>All right.</i>

19:00.640 --> 19:01.710
So?

19:03.400 --> 19:04.675
He's gonna pay?

19:04.880 --> 19:06.360
Mmm-hmm.
I can't...

19:07.240 --> 19:09.072
A million dollars?

19:10.440 --> 19:12.477
A million... Oh!

19:13.000 --> 19:14.036
Are you kidding me?

19:16.800 --> 19:18.314
Do you have
a closet that locks?
Yeah.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.869
The...
the pantry locks, I think.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.634
Oh, my God. A million...

19:23.720 --> 19:27.680
Hey... how big is that...
a million dollars?

19:27.760 --> 19:30.400
Does it... does it fit
into a suitcase or, like,
a sack or something?

19:30.520 --> 19:32.477
It's gonna be...
it's gotta be
pretty heavy, right?

19:32.560 --> 19:35.075
Hey, can I...
can I lay in it?

19:35.160 --> 19:36.799
You know,
I always liked
that part of movies

19:36.880 --> 19:38.519
where the characters,
they just lay
in a big pile...

19:38.600 --> 19:39.636
You got a drill?

19:39.760 --> 19:40.796
Yeah.

19:41.920 --> 19:43.832
And then they always...
they always take the money,

19:43.920 --> 19:45.832
and they just, like,
throw it up in the air,

19:45.920 --> 19:48.116
and the money just...

19:48.200 --> 19:50.795
just, like, flutters down
on top of them, you know?

19:50.880 --> 19:53.076
God damn.
We're doing this.
We're really...

19:54.160 --> 19:55.150
I got goose bumps.

19:55.240 --> 19:56.310
Wood screws.

19:56.440 --> 19:57.510
Yeah.

19:57.600 --> 20:01.514
I'm gonna buy real
marble for the spa.
6 inches thick.

20:02.280 --> 20:05.751
I got these...
I got these
French lotions on hold.

20:05.840 --> 20:07.559
They smell like sunflowers.

20:08.640 --> 20:09.710
Uh, these?

20:10.440 --> 20:11.715
Longer.
Okay.

20:11.800 --> 20:12.995
So what do we...
what do we do?

20:13.080 --> 20:14.196
Just, like,
call him in the morning,

20:14.280 --> 20:16.397
you know,
tell him where to meet us?

20:16.480 --> 20:17.550
I don't know, these?

20:17.680 --> 20:18.796
Yeah, give me a few.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.553
Look at me.
I'm sweating.

20:20.640 --> 20:23.075
Here. Oh, man.

20:23.200 --> 20:28.070
Hey... do I get to
use that voice thing again?

20:28.160 --> 20:30.834
You know, the...
the Darth Vader,
super sinister, like,

20:30.920 --> 20:32.832
"Luke, I am your father."

20:32.960 --> 20:33.950
Please step in.

20:34.040 --> 20:35.030
Sure.

20:37.120 --> 20:40.113
Hey, you know, I...
I never even asked you,

20:40.200 --> 20:42.317
what are you gonna do
with your share of the money?

20:42.400 --> 20:44.995
I mean,
I told you about my...

20:46.440 --> 20:47.430
Uh...

20:47.880 --> 20:50.952
Yeah, am I...
Did you mean to
lock me in here?

20:51.040 --> 20:52.759
We got a big day tomorrow.
Get some rest.

20:52.840 --> 20:56.880
I don't want you
getting cold feet.
I'll see you in the morning.

20:56.960 --> 21:00.795
No, no, wait.
Hold on now. Heck, I'm...

21:01.680 --> 21:03.080
What am I supposed to...

21:03.160 --> 21:05.629
What... what if I
gotta go to the toilet?

21:05.720 --> 21:08.474
You're a smart guy.
You'll figure something out.

21:14.520 --> 21:15.510
Poop.

21:44.440 --> 21:46.272
I have news.

21:46.360 --> 21:48.556
It's just slowing
down at the shop.

21:50.000 --> 21:50.990
Lester?

21:51.120 --> 21:52.952
It's not my fault.

21:53.080 --> 21:55.834
You bought me...
you bought me the tie.

21:56.560 --> 21:58.074
You... You...

22:07.840 --> 22:09.240
Is it a cut or what is it?

22:09.320 --> 22:11.835
Puncture, maybe.
Hard to tell
with all the gore.

22:12.720 --> 22:14.393
Mr. Nygaard,
can you hear me?

22:15.400 --> 22:18.199
It's the towel sound.
She's washing towels.

22:19.040 --> 22:21.794
Mr. Nygaard,
we're getting you
to the hospital.

22:21.880 --> 22:23.075
What happened to your hand?

22:23.160 --> 22:24.196
Socks.

22:24.360 --> 22:25.396
What about socks?

22:25.480 --> 22:28.871
For $55 he threw
in the shotgun.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.276
I don't understand.
Were you shot?

22:36.000 --> 22:36.990
Mr. Nygaard.

22:40.680 --> 22:43.036
Did you pay Lorne Malvo
to kill Sam Hess?

22:44.040 --> 22:45.872
I never paid him.

22:46.760 --> 22:48.797
Okay, offered to pay then.

22:48.880 --> 22:51.793
Made a deal.
And then... when he
came for the money...

22:51.880 --> 22:54.793
I never paid.
I didn't pay.

22:55.640 --> 22:56.869
Yeah, okay, but...

22:56.960 --> 23:01.113
arrangements were made...
and then...

23:01.200 --> 23:02.873
I don't know,
you tell me,
things went south--

23:02.960 --> 23:03.916
Excuse us, miss.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.673
There...

23:06.680 --> 23:07.796
There.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.036
All right,
we'll get you inside.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.919
Of course.
Left right there.

23:44.040 --> 23:45.554
Is that what
you're looking for then?

24:44.680 --> 24:45.955
Two kids.

24:46.720 --> 24:47.915
I'm sorry?

24:49.560 --> 24:53.110
I got two kids and a wife
who thinks out loud.

24:53.880 --> 24:55.234
This is the time I get.

24:56.720 --> 24:58.951
Accidental for me.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.160
Troubled mind.

25:02.320 --> 25:03.754
I'll come to you.

25:15.080 --> 25:18.278
The winters are cold...
but I can't complain.

25:20.520 --> 25:24.309
My socks have holes...
but again, do I complain?

25:24.400 --> 25:25.390
I do not.

25:27.360 --> 25:30.194
The oldest needs braces...

25:30.280 --> 25:33.796
the youngest once sneezed
for three days straight...

25:35.400 --> 25:37.278
but who could complain?

25:37.360 --> 25:38.635
They're gifts.

25:39.360 --> 25:40.396
Children?

25:40.520 --> 25:41.556
All of it.

25:42.280 --> 25:44.272
The cold, the holes.

25:49.280 --> 25:52.193
Hey, so...
I have a question.

25:52.320 --> 25:54.471
Spiritually, I mean.
Um...

25:54.560 --> 25:56.313
Or not spiritually, but...

25:56.400 --> 26:00.235
I don't know, of...
like, an ethical nature.

26:00.960 --> 26:01.950
Please.

26:03.960 --> 26:05.189
Well...

26:07.320 --> 26:09.516
let's say I know
a person is guilty.

26:09.600 --> 26:14.072
He's committed a crime,
only... you know...
I can't prove it.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.357
Like, he has
everyone else fooled,
but... but I know.

26:20.960 --> 26:21.950
What am I--

26:22.040 --> 26:23.235
Find the proof.

26:23.320 --> 26:26.711
Yeah... okay,
but here's the thing...

26:26.800 --> 26:28.837
I'm no detective.

26:30.520 --> 26:33.240
I mean, Molly, she's...

26:33.360 --> 26:34.589
amazing.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.160
But I just...

26:37.720 --> 26:40.599
And then there's Greta,
you know, and... and...

26:40.680 --> 26:43.991
Am I supposed to
put myself in danger
or do I just...

26:45.360 --> 26:48.671
I don't know,
just... let it go?

26:52.760 --> 26:55.195
A rich man opens
the paper one day.

26:56.160 --> 26:58.277
He sees the world
is full of misery.

26:58.360 --> 26:59.555
Is this a...

26:59.720 --> 27:00.915
It's a parable.

27:02.440 --> 27:04.750
A rich man opens
the paper one day.

27:04.840 --> 27:07.355
He sees the world
is full of misery.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.552
<i>He says...</i>

27:10.640 --> 27:12.996
<i>"I have money.
I can help."</i>

27:15.200 --> 27:18.750
<i>So, he gives away
all of his money...</i>

27:23.200 --> 27:25.271
<i>but it's not enough.</i>

27:25.360 --> 27:27.636
<i>The people are
still suffering.</i>

27:31.680 --> 27:33.558
<i>One day the man
sees another article.</i>

27:36.440 --> 27:41.595
<i>He decides he was
foolish to think just
giving money was enough.</i>

27:41.720 --> 27:43.518
<i>So, he goes to
the doctor and says,</i>

27:43.680 --> 27:45.512
<i>"Doctor, I want to
donate a kidney."</i>

27:47.720 --> 27:50.076
<i>The doctors do the surgery.</i>

27:51.760 --> 27:53.717
<i>It's a complete success.</i>

27:58.080 --> 28:01.517
<i>After, he knows
he should feel good,
but he doesn't...</i>

28:02.680 --> 28:04.956
<i>for people are
still suffering.</i>

28:07.440 --> 28:10.399
<i>So he goes back
to the doctor.</i>

28:10.480 --> 28:14.599
<i>He says, "Doctor,
this time, I want
to give it all."</i>

28:15.760 --> 28:18.195
<i>The doctor says,
"What does that mean,
give it all?"</i>

28:18.280 --> 28:21.398
<i>He says, "This time,
I want to donate my liver...</i>

28:21.480 --> 28:23.119
but not just my liver.

28:23.200 --> 28:25.715
I want to donate my heart,
but not just my heart.

28:25.800 --> 28:28.793
I want to donate my corneas,
but not just my corneas.

28:28.880 --> 28:31.111
<i>I want to
give it all away...</i>

28:32.080 --> 28:33.719
<i>everything I am...</i>

28:33.800 --> 28:35.473
<i>all that I have."</i>

28:36.640 --> 28:38.074
<i>The doctor says,</i>

28:38.160 --> 28:39.674
<i>"A kidney is one thing,</i>

28:39.760 --> 28:42.639
<i>but you can't give away
your whole body,
piece by piece.</i>

28:42.720 --> 28:43.915
<i>That's suicide."</i>

28:44.880 --> 28:46.473
<i>And he sends the man home.</i>

28:50.760 --> 28:53.400
<i>But the man cannot live...</i>

28:53.480 --> 28:58.111
<i>knowing that
the people are suffering
and he could help.</i>

28:59.880 --> 29:02.600
<i>So he gives the one
thing he has left...</i>

29:03.560 --> 29:04.550
<i>his life.</i>

29:12.560 --> 29:15.519
<i>And does it work?
Does it stop the suffering?</i>

29:17.000 --> 29:19.720
You live in the world.
What do you think?

29:20.720 --> 29:23.599
So, he killed
himself for nothing?

29:23.680 --> 29:24.830
Did he?

29:25.760 --> 29:27.319
Well, I mean...

29:29.880 --> 29:31.519
You're saying...

29:35.800 --> 29:37.519
What are you saying?

29:38.280 --> 29:41.591
Only a fool thinks
he can solve
the world's problems.

29:43.680 --> 29:46.195
Yeah, but you gotta
try, don't you?

30:09.200 --> 30:10.270
Nope.

30:57.720 --> 30:58.995
Keep it running.

31:18.280 --> 31:20.556
Say, Dad...

31:20.640 --> 31:23.553
I was talking
to the, uh, bug guy.

31:23.640 --> 31:25.711
He's saying this
is all real odd.

31:25.800 --> 31:30.079
The crickets...
he's saying they're
not local, you know...

31:30.200 --> 31:31.634
not from around here.

31:31.720 --> 31:32.710
He's saying
they're the kind

31:32.800 --> 31:34.996
you buy at a pet store
to feed your lizard or...

31:35.120 --> 31:36.076
God sent them.

31:36.160 --> 31:39.073
Yeah... but, well...

31:39.160 --> 31:42.232
So... I called around
to all the pet stores,

31:42.320 --> 31:43.470
and wouldn't you know--

31:43.560 --> 31:45.313
Look, kid,
I don't have
time for this now.

31:45.400 --> 31:47.357
Just clean it up.
Then pack your shit.

31:47.440 --> 31:49.272
Wally is coming
to take you to the cabin.

31:49.360 --> 31:50.555
Yeah, but, Dad...
No buts!

31:50.640 --> 31:52.871
Just do it.

32:09.400 --> 32:10.720
Excuse me.

32:14.600 --> 32:15.920
Hey there, Molly.

32:16.040 --> 32:17.190
Hey.

32:17.280 --> 32:18.430
Uh, Lester okay?

32:18.520 --> 32:20.989
He's had a bad week,
that's for sure.
Yeah.

32:21.080 --> 32:22.878
What's this?
His third time in?
Yeah.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.913
On the plus side,
the nose is healing nicely.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.673
Well, that's a start.
Yeah.

32:29.120 --> 32:31.635
So... Uh, listen,
about that hand...

32:31.760 --> 32:33.114
Oh, real mess there.

32:33.200 --> 32:35.669
Super infected, nasty stuff.

32:35.760 --> 32:38.434
I drained the wound,
removed the foreign object,

32:38.560 --> 32:42.634
cut away the necrotic tissue,
and filled him full
of IV antibiotics.

32:42.720 --> 32:44.632
He won't lose the hand,
but it came close.

32:44.720 --> 32:47.519
Yeah. Now, when you say...
foreign object...

32:47.600 --> 32:49.193
Shotgun pellet,
looked like.

32:49.320 --> 32:50.800
Had some fabric
attached to it.

32:50.880 --> 32:53.315
So, it's possible the pellet
passed through something

32:53.400 --> 32:56.199
before getting
into Lester's hand.

32:56.280 --> 32:57.760
Yeah, or someone.

32:57.840 --> 32:59.593
Pardon?

32:59.680 --> 33:00.670
Can I talk to him?

33:00.760 --> 33:01.750
Well, he's sedated now,

33:01.840 --> 33:04.674
on account of
he was septic when
you brought him in, so...

33:04.760 --> 33:06.194
Like I said,
real nasty stuff.

33:06.320 --> 33:07.720
Right, yeah, yeah.

33:07.800 --> 33:09.712
Be a while before
he can answer any questions.

33:09.840 --> 33:11.240
Hey, you seen Ida?

33:12.320 --> 33:13.310
Wait, is she here?

33:13.400 --> 33:16.472
Yeah... upstairs.
Just had the baby.

33:16.560 --> 33:18.313
Holy smokes.
Yeah.

33:18.400 --> 33:19.390
Girl or boy?

33:20.560 --> 33:24.349
Bernadette,
I heard, so... girl.

33:25.280 --> 33:26.873
Yeah.
Yeah.

33:26.960 --> 33:29.236
<i>Dr. Esbit, call 1 18.</i>

33:29.360 --> 33:31.317
Excuse me.
All right.

37:07.800 --> 37:09.951
It was the Romans,
wasn't it?

37:14.080 --> 37:15.753
What are you saying?

37:15.840 --> 37:19.550
Saint Lawrence, your window...
the Romans burned him alive.

37:21.120 --> 37:23.077
They did?

37:23.160 --> 37:24.150
You know why?

37:25.040 --> 37:27.236
'Cause he was Christian.

37:27.320 --> 37:28.993
Maybe.

37:30.720 --> 37:34.680
But I think it was
because the Romans
were raised by wolves.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.676
Greatest empire
in human history,
founded by wolves.

37:42.400 --> 37:44.357
You know what wolves do.

37:45.720 --> 37:47.712
They hunt.

37:48.520 --> 37:49.840
They kill.

37:51.840 --> 37:54.435
That's why I never bought
into <i>The Jungle Book.</i>

37:54.520 --> 37:55.795
A boy is raised by wolves,

37:55.880 --> 37:58.634
he becomes friends
with a bear and a panther.

37:58.720 --> 38:00.279
I don't think so.

38:05.560 --> 38:09.440
I knew a guy once.
Had a 110-pound Rottweiler...

38:09.520 --> 38:11.432
and one night,
this girl thought
it'd be funny

38:11.520 --> 38:14.718
to get down on all fours
and let the dog hump her.

38:15.800 --> 38:17.917
The dog still
had its balls.

38:18.880 --> 38:22.430
Well, the dog gets up there,
but he's not in on the joke.

38:23.880 --> 38:27.032
This is just a bitch in heat
as far as he's concerned...

38:27.120 --> 38:30.397
and he's not leaving till
he gets what he came for.

38:31.760 --> 38:35.470
Well, the girl, too late,
realizes the kind of
mistake she's made.

38:35.560 --> 38:37.313
She wants to get up.

38:39.080 --> 38:41.197
But the dog had other ideas.

38:44.880 --> 38:47.554
Had to shoot it
behind the ear to
get it off of her.

38:51.080 --> 38:52.992
I don't... I don't...

38:53.080 --> 38:55.072
Well, I'm saying that...

38:55.160 --> 38:57.277
the Romans,
raised by wolves,

38:57.360 --> 39:00.671
they see a guy
turning water into wine...

39:00.760 --> 39:01.830
what do they do?

39:01.920 --> 39:03.400
They eat him.

39:04.760 --> 39:08.356
'Cause there are no saints
in the animal kingdom.

39:08.440 --> 39:10.432
Only breakfast and dinner.

40:09.280 --> 40:11.590
So what time do
you want me to pick
you up in the morning?

40:11.720 --> 40:14.440
No... we're done.

40:14.520 --> 40:16.671
You can stay the night,
but you gotta hit
the road come dawn.

40:17.800 --> 40:19.678
Here's what I owe you.

40:21.480 --> 40:23.472
Sorry it didn't work out.

40:54.600 --> 40:55.875
Grimly.

40:55.960 --> 40:58.680
<i>Heya... it's Molly.</i>

40:58.760 --> 41:00.399
Oh, yeah,
how you doin' there?

41:00.520 --> 41:02.159
Pretty good.

41:02.240 --> 41:03.799
How's things
going with you?

41:03.880 --> 41:08.477
Not bad. Just...
trying to figure
this thing out.

41:08.560 --> 41:10.677
Yeah, so,
I was wondering...

41:10.760 --> 41:12.353
with this fella
I arrested...

41:13.520 --> 41:17.150
how come he was there,
you know, on the street...

41:17.240 --> 41:18.310
on that street?

41:18.400 --> 41:20.392
I mean,
if he is our guy and not,

41:20.480 --> 41:22.551
you know,
some pastor actually.

41:23.800 --> 41:25.029
<i>So what'd
you come up with?</i>

41:25.120 --> 41:26.918
Well, see...

41:27.000 --> 41:30.072
I'm not sure
what I'm looking
for is the problem.

41:30.160 --> 41:34.632
Plus, you know,
it's dark out, so...
maybe go back out tomorrow.

41:34.760 --> 41:37.036
Oh. I was thinking
I might drive
out in the morning,

41:37.120 --> 41:38.395
take a look at Lester's car.

41:39.240 --> 41:42.836
Thought maybe...
after we could get together.

41:42.920 --> 41:44.149
You know,
compare notes on this thing.

41:45.320 --> 41:48.119
Sure. That'd be...

41:48.200 --> 41:49.475
I'd like that.

41:51.080 --> 41:52.355
Okay, so tomorrow then.

41:53.080 --> 41:54.230
Okay.

42:21.080 --> 42:23.356
<i>What'd you get
for number three?</i>

42:23.440 --> 42:26.114
<i>X squared.
What'd you get for four?</i>

42:28.120 --> 42:29.839
<i>A rhombus?</i>

42:41.560 --> 42:42.596
Help you?

42:42.680 --> 42:44.478
You're not
supposed to be here.

42:45.360 --> 42:48.797
Oh, no, I'm pretty sure
I'm right where
I'm supposed to be.

43:02.640 --> 43:03.960
Hi.

43:04.040 --> 43:05.360
Neighborhood watch.

43:05.440 --> 43:07.397
If you don't move,
I'm gonna have
to call the cops.

43:07.520 --> 43:09.591
Well, friend,
there's no need for that.

43:09.680 --> 43:11.876
This is a nice neighborhood.

43:11.960 --> 43:14.839
Children play in
the streets, my children.

43:14.920 --> 43:18.152
We have block parties...
fruit punch.

43:18.280 --> 43:21.956
We don't need a man
in a dark car doing things.

43:22.800 --> 43:24.280
You mean like sitting?

43:24.360 --> 43:25.714
Don't be a <i>nudnik.</i>

43:25.800 --> 43:27.917
This is a community.

43:28.040 --> 43:30.236
People watch
each other's backs.

43:30.320 --> 43:33.074
Someone gets sick,
someone dies,
you bring a casserole...

43:33.160 --> 43:34.150
help.

43:34.880 --> 43:36.439
Maybe I'm here to help.

43:36.520 --> 43:38.318
No, you have black eyes.

43:38.400 --> 43:39.436
You're trouble.

43:39.520 --> 43:41.955
I'm going inside
and I'm calling the cops.

43:42.040 --> 43:43.076
Which building?

43:43.880 --> 43:46.031
The one with
the Jew bus outside?

43:47.200 --> 43:49.112
There it is.

43:49.200 --> 43:50.714
Now the truth comes out.

43:51.680 --> 43:54.036
You know...
some people think

43:54.120 --> 43:57.796
you don't need alarms
on second story windows.

43:57.880 --> 44:01.430
They think they
can save a few bucks,
you know, and still be safe.

44:02.560 --> 44:03.789
Another way they save money

44:03.880 --> 44:07.556
is they don't
hook up the alarm
to the phone line,

44:07.640 --> 44:10.633
so the bell rings,
but the cops don't come...

44:11.560 --> 44:14.712
or they come,
but only after
the neighbors call...

44:15.840 --> 44:20.039
which... if this community
is tight as you say,

44:20.120 --> 44:21.520
you know...

44:23.080 --> 44:26.517
just might be quick enough
to save your life...

44:26.640 --> 44:29.235
or your children's lives...

44:29.320 --> 44:30.595
maybe.

44:31.840 --> 44:33.240
Se'irim.

44:34.320 --> 44:36.198
You have a nice night.

45:12.280 --> 45:13.714
How come we're all
in the hall then?

45:13.800 --> 45:16.634
Ida kicked us out...
said we were being too loud.

45:16.720 --> 45:19.030
Ah. You know,
she did just
have a baby, so...

45:19.120 --> 45:20.474
Ah. We all agreed it
was a good point.

45:20.640 --> 45:21.960
Yeah.

45:24.800 --> 45:27.599
So you're... being loud
in the hall instead.

45:29.960 --> 45:32.236
All right, boys,
let's... pack it up.

45:32.320 --> 45:33.549
Call her a night.

45:33.640 --> 45:35.677
You really wanna go out there?
No.

45:35.760 --> 45:36.910
Goin' away.
From me.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.559
I gotta protect
the baby here.

45:38.640 --> 45:40.438
Come on...
Bill's got a job to do.

45:40.520 --> 45:42.989
Hey, you're making
too much noise.

45:48.200 --> 45:50.237
Sorry, you sleeping?

45:57.840 --> 46:00.435
Well,
that's a baby, all right.

46:00.520 --> 46:01.840
Smell her.

46:04.320 --> 46:05.310
Okay.

46:13.520 --> 46:15.034
That's what a new
one smells like then.

46:15.120 --> 46:16.190
Yeah.

46:17.680 --> 46:19.160
How you holding up?

46:19.240 --> 46:20.276
Me?

46:20.360 --> 46:22.272
You're the one
just had a baby.

46:22.360 --> 46:23.874
Yeah, but I get
to lie down now.

46:24.040 --> 46:25.520
Yeah.

46:26.440 --> 46:28.272
I just look tired.

46:28.360 --> 46:30.113
Inside, I'm raring to go.

46:35.040 --> 46:36.679
So...

46:39.040 --> 46:40.793
How much do you wanna--
I don't need details.

46:40.880 --> 46:42.872
Just tell me
you're taking care of it.

46:44.280 --> 46:45.873
I'm trying, yeah.

46:53.640 --> 46:55.711
Do you want me
to stay the night?
I could sleep in the chair.

46:55.800 --> 46:57.120
No, I got people coming...

46:57.200 --> 47:00.113
my sister and her daughter.

47:00.200 --> 47:02.192
Be here around
11:00, she said.

47:03.080 --> 47:05.993
They said... Bernadette.

47:06.080 --> 47:08.515
Vern's idea...
his mother's name.

47:09.240 --> 47:11.471
I wanted Allie.

47:11.560 --> 47:14.234
And now he's dead.

47:14.320 --> 47:16.232
That man always knew
how to win an argument.

47:19.960 --> 47:21.314
I think it's pretty, so...

47:21.440 --> 47:23.909
Good 'cause
you're the babysitter.

47:26.320 --> 47:28.676
Now go home.
Let me sleep.

47:28.760 --> 47:30.877
And you do the same.
You look like a raccoon.

47:30.960 --> 47:33.191
Yeah.

47:33.280 --> 47:36.239
I gotta go to
Duluth in the a.m.,
but I'll stop by after, yeah.
