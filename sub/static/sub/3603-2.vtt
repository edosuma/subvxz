35:34.842 --> 35:37.299
You're gonna
make this right.

35:37.386 --> 35:38.876
We'll do anotherjob,

35:38.971 --> 35:41.929
something big enough
we can drop a fat stack
on his desk,

35:42.016 --> 35:44.348
get him off our backs.

35:44.435 --> 35:46.346
I'm not a thief.

35:46.437 --> 35:47.472
Maybe not.

35:47.896 --> 35:50.763
But you certainly handled
those two like a pro.

35:50.858 --> 35:52.974
And that makes you
something, now,
doesn't it?

35:53.068 --> 35:55.525
What's to say I don't do
the same thing to you
and walk out of here?

35:55.612 --> 35:58.149
I thought common courtesy
would do it.

35:58.240 --> 36:01.198
No? Then maybe this.

36:03.871 --> 36:05.736
You might want this,

36:06.540 --> 36:08.576
Peter.

36:12.338 --> 36:13.498
My name's Peter?

36:13.589 --> 36:16.422
Sounds about right,
doesn't it?
Just something I read.

36:17.217 --> 36:19.833
This here's everything
you had on you
when we found you.

36:19.928 --> 36:22.670
Credit cards,
maybe a train ticket.

36:22.765 --> 36:24.096
Could even be
aloveleﬂer

36:25.100 --> 36:27.136
It's all yours.

36:27.770 --> 36:31.934
You just have to help us
with one little job.

36:32.274 --> 36:35.687
What do you say, Peter?

36:38.655 --> 36:41.863
Hello? Mr. Kensei?
Mr. Kensei?

36:41.950 --> 36:44.817
You stole my armor,
left me withal.
Who do you think you are?

36:44.912 --> 36:47.324
I only did it
to save Yaeko.

36:47.414 --> 36:51.202
And to show that
Takezo Kensei is not
a drunk but a hero.

36:51.293 --> 36:53.204
And I did.
You did?

36:53.295 --> 36:56.458
Yes, they're already
telling of your bravery.

36:58.175 --> 37:00.211
And what exactly
did I do on this day?

37:00.302 --> 37:03.886
You disarmed 11 men
and rescued a beautiful girl.

37:04.264 --> 37:07.256
(CHUCKLING) I'm to believe
you did all that
and took no credit?

All right, Carp. I'm in.

37:41.844 --> 37:42.833
Really?

37:42.928 --> 37:44.384
I don't know
what brand of fool
you truly are,

37:44.471 --> 37:46.848
but it appears
listening to you will
grant me more reward.

37:46.932 --> 37:48.763
And more of her.
It will!

37:48.851 --> 37:50.887
You can make me
the hero she sees in me.

37:50.978 --> 37:52.559
As long as you stop drinking.

37:53.063 --> 37:54.439

38:27.764 --> 38:30.221

next time around.

Night shift, don't ask.

39:48.387 --> 39:49.627
Was it a productive trip?

39:50.222 --> 39:52.304
You should have the answer
to that yourself very shortly.

39:52.391 --> 39:54.973
And you didn't arouse
any suspicions?

39:55.269 --> 39:56.475
I don't think so.

at himself for trusting
the bungling professor.

more closely now.

That’s to be expected.
Don’t worry.
