WEBVTT

00:08.240 --> 00:10.800
- Wow. Better than I remember.

00:10.840 --> 00:14.731
- Then you've got a bad memory.

00:20.480 --> 00:23.540
- No. No.

00:23.590 --> 00:26.218
I have to go to work.

00:26.260 --> 00:29.457
- Oh, stop it. Don't you have
lives to go save or something?

00:29.490 --> 00:32.550
- If you're talking
about the ER, this week
has been all toothaches

00:32.600 --> 00:36.058
and sprained ligaments. Oh,
and one bout of food poisoning.

00:36.100 --> 00:38.762
- Guess you'll have to go back
to Nigeria to get your fill.

00:41.170 --> 00:44.401
- Actually, this city
is kind of growing on me.

00:44.440 --> 00:46.670
Keep Saturday night open.

00:46.710 --> 00:48.735
I have a surprise for you.

00:54.650 --> 00:56.618
- Everett Investigations.

00:56.650 --> 00:59.187
Oh, yeah.

00:59.220 --> 01:01.279
Sure. OK.

01:03.860 --> 01:07.159
What's the address?

01:07.200 --> 01:09.521
- Yeah, that's right.
Saturday night.

01:09.570 --> 01:12.334
We're gonna need
the whole place. It's
my daughter's birthday.

01:12.370 --> 01:15.089
Alright, I'll swing by and bring
you a cheque later. Thanks.

01:15.140 --> 01:19.133
- Yeah. 15th.

01:19.180 --> 01:23.105
- Just a little something

01:23.150 --> 01:25.539
we're throwing together,
just some Ellard students

01:25.580 --> 01:27.616
and their parents.
You wouldn't want to be there.

01:27.650 --> 01:30.346
Not that you were asking
to be there. You don't want
to be there, right?

01:30.390 --> 01:32.358
- Yeah, no...

01:32.390 --> 01:34.358
Not unless you want me to be.

01:37.630 --> 01:39.791
- Hello.

01:39.830 --> 01:42.719
- Hey, um, Danon and Brock,
3O mil]1utes?

01:42.770 --> 01:45.568
- [I'm not entirely sure,
but the woman on the phone]

01:45.600 --> 01:47.830
was pretty upset. She said
it was something about a...

01:47.870 --> 01:49.838
dead body.

01:49.870 --> 01:54.409
- Not exactly what
I had in mind.
- Ditto.

01:54.440 --> 01:57.147
- Hey, uh,

01:57.180 --> 02:00.240
what's going on with your hair?
- Nothing.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.885
I just didn't have time
to blow dry.
- Mm-hmm.

02:02.920 --> 02:06.412
And why's that, Ms. Everett?
- Whatever. You have lipstick
on your collar.

02:07.960 --> 02:11.589
- Yes. I am Angie Everett.

02:11.630 --> 02:13.598
This is my partner, Matt Shade.
- Hi.

02:13.630 --> 02:16.758
- Hi. Jacinta Kalfas.
I need to preface with--

02:16.800 --> 02:20.566
this has never happened
to our business before.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.363
This way.

02:25.770 --> 02:29.171
It was supposed to be
Leo Stewart's visitation

02:29.210 --> 02:31.804
and cremation this afternoon.
Father. Grandfather.

02:31.850 --> 02:35.342
President of his mining union.
Recreational bowling champion...

02:35.380 --> 02:37.644
- Right.
So what's the problem?

02:37.690 --> 02:40.887
- This is not Leo Stewart.

02:50.400 --> 02:53.892
- ** I see you and you see me

02:53.940 --> 02:58.229
* Watch you blowin' the lines
when you're making a scene *

02:58.270 --> 03:01.706
* Oh boy, you've got to know

03:01.740 --> 03:03.879
* What my head overlooks

03:03.910 --> 03:06.845
* The senses will show
to my heart *

03:06.880 --> 03:09.348
* When it's watching for lies

03:09.390 --> 03:12.518
* 'Cause you can't escape my

03:12.560 --> 03:14.448
* Private Eyes

03:14.490 --> 03:16.685
* They're watching you

03:16.730 --> 03:18.982
* Private Eyes

03:19.030 --> 03:20.998
* They're watching you,
watching you, watching you *

03:21.030 --> 03:25.228
* Watching you *

03:35.510 --> 03:37.978
- That's not Grampie Leo!

03:38.010 --> 03:40.774
That's not Grampie Leo!

03:42.820 --> 03:44.788
- It was awful.
- Why don't you start

03:44.820 --> 03:47.653
at the beginning?
- Um, OK.

03:47.690 --> 03:50.989
So we got a call
from Leo's daughter Esta.

03:51.030 --> 03:53.897
She wanted us to provide funeral
services for her late father.

03:53.930 --> 03:56.490
She wanted a simple
closed-casket visitation

03:56.530 --> 03:59.021
followed by a cremation.
- So you had the right body

03:59.070 --> 04:00.935
until... _
- Turns out we never dId.

04:00.970 --> 04:03.006
My sister Hanna
picked the body up--

04:03.040 --> 04:05.508
- Hanna, great, there you are.

04:05.540 --> 04:07.872
These are the P15 that
I was telling you about.

04:07.910 --> 04:10.276
- I thought we were going
to talk about this.

04:10.310 --> 04:13.746
- We can't really afford
your services.

04:13.780 --> 04:15.919
- Hanna,
we lost a body!

04:15.950 --> 04:17.986
How are we gonna recover
from that if word gets out?

04:18.020 --> 04:21.012
We're struggling financially.
Our parents retired 7 years ago,

04:21.060 --> 04:23.051
leaving us the business--
- They don't need to know

04:23.090 --> 04:25.024
our whole life story, Jacinta.

04:25.060 --> 04:27.028
What are we supposed
to tell them? Oh my gosh.

04:27.060 --> 04:29.028
Those poor people.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.824
- Fine. I was the one
who picked up the body

04:31.870 --> 04:33.861
from the hospital.
- And you didn't notice

04:33.900 --> 04:36.437
you had the wrong guy?
- The toe-tag said Leo Stewart.

04:36.470 --> 04:38.631
We didn't have a picture yet.

04:38.670 --> 04:40.706
Who dressed him?

04:40.740 --> 04:43.948
- I did. But it was
a closed casket service,

04:43.980 --> 04:46.813
so I didn't focus
on the cosmetology part.

04:46.850 --> 04:48.818
- They're antacids,

04:48.850 --> 04:52.616
Jacinta,
not candy. Look,

04:52.660 --> 04:55.709
I called the hospital morgue
and they told me the records
check out.

04:55.760 --> 04:58.479
- So you have no idea
who this guy is?

05:00.130 --> 05:02.963
- Tonight at 7.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.763
Esta has agreed not to tell
the rest of the family

05:04.800 --> 05:06.665
until we find
the body,

05:06.700 --> 05:08.839
but we need him back by tonight.

05:08.870 --> 05:11.430
- If you could please,
please keep this quiet...

05:11.470 --> 05:13.472
- We'll do our best.

05:15.480 --> 05:18.904
- Thank you.

05:18.950 --> 05:22.681
- The hospital morgue
is downtown, but traffic

05:22.720 --> 05:24.984
is a headache.
- Speaking of which.

05:25.020 --> 05:28.581
Hello, Becca.
]

05:28.620 --> 05:31.487
If you're gonna screw this up,
can you tell me in advance?

05:31.530 --> 05:33.521
- Angie's here.
You're on speaker.

05:33.560 --> 05:35.528
- Hi, Becca.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.824
- [It's Jules' 15th birthday
this weekend,]

05:37.870 --> 05:40.134
[and I am just spread
a little bit thin

05:40.170 --> 05:43.139
- Which is why I told you I'd
take care of it. And yes,
I booked the venue.

05:45.770 --> 05:47.408
]
- My next call.

05:47.440 --> 05:50.443
- I gotta go. But Shadow,

05:50.480 --> 05:53.938
Jules is at Ellard now. And this
is vitally important to her.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.789
- Didn't we just
establish that I--

05:59.990 --> 06:02.720
Why does Becca think
I can't handle this?

06:02.760 --> 06:05.479
Hey, do you wanna come?
- Oh, I would,

06:05.530 --> 06:08.499
but Ken made plans for us.
It's some surprise.

06:08.530 --> 06:10.589
- Really. What kind
of a surprise?

06:10.630 --> 06:12.689
- I have no idea.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.867
- Interesting.

06:14.900 --> 06:17.061
- What's that
supposed to mean?

06:17.110 --> 06:19.908
- Well, it just seems like you
guys are progressing quickly.

06:19.940 --> 06:23.046
- Not at all.
It's totally casual.

06:23.080 --> 06:26.709
- Whatever you need
to tell yourself.
What about you and Mel?

06:26.750 --> 06:29.514
You seem to be spending
a lot of time together lately.

06:29.550 --> 06:32.553
Did you invite her
to Jules' party?
- Uh...

06:32.590 --> 06:35.081
Sort of. Oh look, here we are.

06:42.230 --> 06:45.722
- I don't really know
what to tell you guys...

06:45.770 --> 06:47.635
- Well, could you try
to tell us something?

06:47.670 --> 06:50.161
Like, how this
could have happened?

06:50.210 --> 06:52.906
- A person dies,
they're brought down here,

06:52.940 --> 06:56.034
the funeral director
comes by, gives me a wave...

06:56.080 --> 06:59.618
- That doesn't seem very secure.
- They're dead bodies,

06:59.650 --> 07:03.586
not bars of gold. I mean,
there's a toe, there's a tag,

07:03.620 --> 07:05.918
they take 'em away.

07:05.950 --> 07:09.113
- Does the hospital keep
a log of all the bodies

07:09.160 --> 07:11.685
that come through here?
- Not really.

07:11.730 --> 07:14.654
I mean, I could pull the files
of all the people

07:14.700 --> 07:16.463
who died in the last few days.
- Great.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.468
Yes.
Good idea. Do that.

07:28.980 --> 07:32.575
- Here they are. Oh, um,

07:32.620 --> 07:35.771
but I think they're,
like, confidential.

07:35.820 --> 07:37.788
- Right. Listen,

07:37.820 --> 07:40.983
how about you just do us
a quick little favour

07:41.020 --> 07:43.488
and see if this guy's
in the morgue?
- Sure.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.131
- I kinda
enw the guy.

07:53.170 --> 07:55.832
A certain amount of cluelessness
seems like bliss, no?

08:00.880 --> 08:04.077
Here he comes.
- Nah, man.

08:04.110 --> 08:07.511
Two bodies is all I got.
One brown dude, one grandma.

08:07.550 --> 08:09.609
- Thanks anyway.
And, uh...

08:09.650 --> 08:11.686
good luck in life.

08:15.260 --> 08:19.026
- And what time was his
visitation? OK. Thank you.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.168
- Well,

08:23.200 --> 08:25.168
I called all the funeral homes

08:25.200 --> 08:27.839
that picked up bodies from
Memorial Hospital that day

08:27.870 --> 08:30.930
and I've narrowed it down to
seven that could have been
switched with Leo Stewart

08:30.970 --> 08:33.973
based off age and
closed-casket services.
- Great.

08:36.040 --> 08:37.701
What's the matter?

08:37.750 --> 08:41.277
- All their lives_.
They're so amazmg.

08:41.320 --> 08:43.538
According to his obit,

08:43.590 --> 08:45.649
Larry here traveled
to 80 different countries.

08:45.690 --> 08:47.783
William served
in two wars

08:47.820 --> 08:49.788
and Cyril
has 14 children

08:49.830 --> 08:53.129
and 38 grandchildren.
- Perspective, Zoe.

08:53.160 --> 08:55.321
I see vagabond, PTSD,

08:55.360 --> 08:57.726
and a man who farmed children.

08:57.770 --> 09:00.796
My life is basically a series

09:00.840 --> 09:03.661
of awkward moments separated
by spoonfuls of peanut butter.

09:05.940 --> 09:08.773
- Yeah, that's right,
'Happy Birthday Jules.‘

09:08.810 --> 09:11.608
With lots of sprinkles
and sparklers.

09:11.650 --> 09:14.141
Yeah. Thanks.

09:14.180 --> 09:16.614
DJ, venue, cake-- done.

09:16.650 --> 09:19.118
- OK, calm down, Martha Stewart.
Put on your best sad face.

09:19.150 --> 09:21.983
And this tie. We have a bunch
of Funeral Homes to visit.

09:22.020 --> 09:24.887
- You think one of them ended up
with Leo Stewart's body?

09:24.930 --> 09:27.649
- They had to. And either
they're unaware of it,
or not owning up to it.

09:27.700 --> 09:30.294
So we're going to sneak in, find
the bodies and check it out
for ourselves.

09:30.330 --> 09:33.891
- Hm! Sounds like quite an
undertaking. Heh, heh, heh!

09:33.940 --> 09:35.965
No?

09:38.940 --> 09:40.908
- I'm so sorry to hear
about your loss.

09:40.940 --> 09:44.148
What was your friend's name?
- Dr. Ken Graham.

09:44.180 --> 09:47.843
He impaled himself on one
of his humanitarian awards.

09:47.880 --> 09:51.316
It was awful.
- It's okay, babe.

09:51.350 --> 09:54.251
Maybe take a moment
in the bathroom?

09:54.290 --> 09:56.258
- Yeah.

10:29.360 --> 10:31.681
- And just like that,

10:31.730 --> 10:34.699
Mel was gone. I told her
not to wear heels

10:34.730 --> 10:36.960
on the subway platform.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.797
I need a minute.

10:43.270 --> 10:47.036
OK. Zombies aren't real.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.674
Zombies aren't real.

11:11.900 --> 11:15.165
Six funeral homes down,
one to go.

11:15.200 --> 11:18.704
Here's hoping. Oh no, the
visitation's started already.

11:18.740 --> 11:20.901
- Wait, look.

11:20.940 --> 11:24.706
- It's the John Doe
from Leo's casket!
- Carl White.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.741
Bet you Grandpa Leo's
in his casket?

11:30.290 --> 11:32.417
- You keep watch, I'll take
a look insidCeNEhe casket.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.851
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:35.890 --> 11:38.051
I didn't realise
anyone was here.

11:38.090 --> 11:40.354
I'll come back.
- No, no, it's fine.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.994
I'm Jon, Carl's son.
This is my wife Katie

11:43.030 --> 11:45.123
and this is Ruby.
And you are...?

11:45.170 --> 11:48.037
- Uh, Brad Wilson.

11:48.070 --> 11:50.834
- Thank you so much for coming.

11:50.870 --> 11:54.499
How did you know my dad?
- Uh... a few years ago,

11:54.540 --> 11:57.043
we crossed paths.
It was brief, but um...

11:57.080 --> 12:00.140
he really impacted my life.
- Sounds like Carl.

12:00.180 --> 12:03.013
- Grandpa lived
in our living room

12:03.050 --> 12:05.211
before he moved to the hospital.

12:05.250 --> 12:07.389
- I bet you really
miss him, huh?

12:10.960 --> 12:12.951
Um, you know,

12:13.000 --> 12:15.855
I'd love to take
this moment for all of us,

12:15.900 --> 12:19.392
to bow our heads and
close our eyes tightly

12:19.430 --> 12:22.137
and reflect
on Carl's life.

12:27.510 --> 12:30.900
Is it our man?
- See for yourself.

12:30.950 --> 12:33.077
- Hey.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.975
What are you doing?

12:36.020 --> 12:37.988
Oh my god.

12:38.020 --> 12:39.954
Where's my dad?

12:48.500 --> 12:51.128
- I've been a funeral director
for twenty years,

12:51.170 --> 12:53.365
this has never happened before.
- Funny,

12:53.400 --> 12:55.834
it's the second time
today for us.

12:55.870 --> 12:58.839
- Michael, where's
my dad's body?
- He's at the Kalfas

12:58.870 --> 13:01.509
Funeral Home, in
Leo Stewart's casket.

13:01.540 --> 13:05.340
We can put you in touch,
but we need your help getting
Leo's body back there.

13:05.380 --> 13:07.974
Who are you people?
- We're private investigators.

13:08.020 --> 13:10.386
There was a mix-up
at the hospital morgue.

13:10.420 --> 13:13.457
- Your father's body was taken
to the Kalfas Funeral Home,
under the name

13:13.490 --> 13:15.981
of Leo Stewart.
- And Leo Stewart's body
ended up here,

13:16.020 --> 13:18.921
labeled as your father's.
Except now, he's gone.

13:18.960 --> 13:20.996
- Who picked up

13:21.030 --> 13:23.362
Leo's body from the morgue?
- I did.

13:23.400 --> 13:27.131
The toe tag said Carl White.
I double-checked the paperwork.
- What about the album

13:27.170 --> 13:29.559
of pictures I gave you
for the photo montage?

13:29.600 --> 13:33.275
Did you double
- My assistant prepped the body.

13:33.310 --> 13:36.973
- Remind me to get my name
tattooed on top of my foot.

13:37.010 --> 13:39.399
- Which one of us gets
to tell Jacinta and Hanna?

13:41.620 --> 13:44.248
- You're going to make me
do it, aren't you?

13:44.290 --> 13:47.214
See you in an hour.
- Michael,

13:47.260 --> 13:50.286
who else had access
to the body you prepped?

13:50.330 --> 13:52.252
- Everyone.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.520
- We've talked to the intern,
the Funer_al Director's
A55istant,

13:54.560 --> 13:57.199
the janitor... Nothing so far.

13:57.230 --> 13:59.596
[Were you able to dig anything
up on the rest of the staff
- Nothing yet.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.939
But I have to say, a lot
of strange people work

14:01.970 --> 14:04.507
in the funeral industry. Ooh...

14:06.610 --> 14:09.101
- Ooh, Stan, the hearse driver,

14:09.140 --> 14:11.472
has an anonymous
Ding N Deal account.

14:11.510 --> 14:13.216
how do you know it's him?

14:13.250 --> 14:16.640
as his OKCupid account--
"@olderisbetter1962".

14:19.120 --> 14:21.657
antique jewelry, accessories...

14:21.690 --> 14:24.158
The items are super eclectic,

14:24.190 --> 14:26.158
it's almost as if...

14:26.190 --> 14:28.954
- They were stolen
from dead bodies.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.468
Nice work, Zoe.

14:55.620 --> 14:59.158
- Angie Everett,
Everett Investigations.
And you must be Stan.

15:01.960 --> 15:04.690
- Wondering where you were
yesterday afternoon.
- I was with my wife all day.

15:04.730 --> 15:06.698
- Does she know you're
on OkCupid?
- Yes.

15:06.730 --> 15:08.459
We have _
an open relationship.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.502
- Oh. Well,

15:10.540 --> 15:13.031
can you explain this?

15:13.080 --> 15:15.230
- I peruse yard sales.

15:17.610 --> 15:19.578
There's four bags of salt
missing. Roughly the weight

15:19.610 --> 15:22.989
of a human corpse.
- I maintain the parking lot
in the winter.

15:23.020 --> 15:27.013
- Come on, it hasn't snowed in
weeks. Where's the body, Stan?

15:27.060 --> 15:28.948
Tell me, or I'm gonna call
my very good friend,
Detective Mazhari.

15:28.990 --> 15:31.151
- No, wait.

15:32.730 --> 15:34.994
I sold it.

15:35.030 --> 15:37.590
To who?
- This kid,

15:37.630 --> 15:40.269
Greg something.
He's a med student,

15:40.300 --> 15:43.667
he needed bodies to practice
surgery on. I figured

15:43.710 --> 15:47.476
it was a closed casket,
who's gonna miss it?
It was an easy 800 bucks.

15:49.610 --> 15:53.216
- Pathology Lab,

15:53.250 --> 15:55.070
Carlington University.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.111
- Thanks, Stan.

16:02.690 --> 16:06.023
- Don't even get me started. How
did Jacinta and Hanna take it?

16:06.060 --> 16:08.255
- Like death_ warmed over.
- We're running out of time.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.461
Leo'_s funeral service
is in an hour.

16:14.270 --> 16:17.728
- Stop! Drop the scalpel.

16:17.770 --> 16:21.228
- I didn't kill him.
He was already dead, I swear!

16:23.510 --> 16:26.775
- It's him.
- That's him. Grampie Leo.

16:26.810 --> 16:28.778
What do we do,
call a hearse, or...?

16:28.820 --> 16:31.539
- They'll never make it
across town and back. Uh...

16:33.760 --> 16:37.526
Here. Put these on.
- I don't like where
this is heading.

16:39.690 --> 16:42.659
- Oh no! I think the security
guard just saw us. Move it!

16:42.700 --> 16:45.225
- This thing's got
a wonlq wheel!

16:45.270 --> 16:48.194
Could you have parked
any further away?

16:48.240 --> 16:51.505
- Shut up! Oh!

16:51.540 --> 16:54.202
I am so bleaching this car
when I get home.

16:54.240 --> 16:55.798
- It's a rental.

16:55.840 --> 16:58.775
- Hurry up!

17:02.450 --> 17:05.146
- Ew!

17:09.120 --> 17:11.179
Go, go, go!

17:11.230 --> 17:13.721
- Hey, stop!

17:23.570 --> 17:26.505
- Thanks.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.338
- Well, that's one grave
crisis averted.

17:35.380 --> 17:37.541
Sorry.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.512
- Thank you so much.
You saved us.

17:39.550 --> 17:42.610
- Happy to help.

17:42.660 --> 17:45.652
- Michael Lukins just arrived to
pick him up and he's downstairs
with Hanna right now.

17:45.690 --> 17:48.750
- I have no idea, but you--

17:48.800 --> 17:50.768
- ...can't come in here
and start yelling at me!

17:52.730 --> 17:55.096
This is not our fault!
- Hanna!

17:55.140 --> 17:57.563
- Your family is going
to pay for this.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.760
- I'm screwe_d! That's
what's gomg on!
- Someone broke in

17:59.810 --> 18:02.370
through the garage.
They smashed the window

18:02.410 --> 18:05.607
and unlocked the door.
- Something's missing alright.

18:05.650 --> 18:08.175
The body I was supposed
to be picking up!

18:10.790 --> 18:14.157
- Someone stole
Carl White's body!

18:22.600 --> 18:25.569
- Lemme get this straight. Two
bodies were switched. One went
missing. You found that body,

18:25.600 --> 18:28.160
and now the other one's gone?
What is this, The X

18:28.200 --> 18:31.499
- It's looking more and more
like the original body swap
wasn't a mistake.

18:33.540 --> 18:36.338
- Michael, what was
supposed to happen

18:36.380 --> 18:40.578
to Carl White's body?
- He was supposed to be buried
after his service on Friday.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.872
- He's being cremated
in the morning.

18:42.920 --> 18:45.616
- Maybe somebody switched

18:45.650 --> 18:48.915
the bodies so that Carl would
get cremated instead of Leo.

18:48.960 --> 18:52.418
- Maybe Carl was murdered.

18:52.460 --> 18:54.428
Cremation would
destroy any foren5ics.

18:54.460 --> 18:57.258
- Which explains why they came
back to grab him a second time.
- OK,

18:57.300 --> 19:00.838
do not jump to any conclusions,
please. I will look around,
talk to the techs

19:00.870 --> 19:03.407
and I'll get back to you, OK?

19:08.240 --> 19:11.471
- They don't know anything yet.

19:11.510 --> 19:14.513
- If you don't get
Carl White's body

19:14.550 --> 19:16.279
back in time
for his funeral,

19:16.320 --> 19:19.448
I'm going to sue you guys
for failing to keep custody

19:19.490 --> 19:21.481
of a body.
You'll be finished.

19:23.660 --> 19:25.855
- This is awful.

19:25.890 --> 19:28.495
- Just try to get some sleep.
We'll stay on top of things
and be in touch tomorrow.

19:28.530 --> 19:30.566
- OK.

19:32.770 --> 19:35.330
- Let's go.

19:48.880 --> 19:51.849
- Hey.
- A potato chip, mayo,

19:51.890 --> 19:54.859
and cheese
What're you stressed out about?
- I'm trying to figure out

19:54.890 --> 19:57.950
the guest list for my party.
Ellard politics.

19:57.990 --> 20:00.652
IfI invite Lynn and Skylar,
that means I have to invite

20:00.700 --> 20:03.794
their circle of tight-knit
friends, which includes
twelve more girls,

20:03.830 --> 20:05.764
two of which I don't know,
three I don't really like--

20:05.800 --> 20:08.928
Don't you dare tell anyone that.
- Honey, relax.

20:08.970 --> 20:11.359
I rented Edge Park Hall. There's
plenty of room for everyone.

20:11.410 --> 20:14.937
That place is huge!
- Only the best

20:14.980 --> 20:16.436
for my baby girl.

20:19.350 --> 20:22.513
Hey,
what's wrong, honey?

20:22.550 --> 20:24.984
Talk to me.
- Nothing.

20:25.020 --> 20:26.942
It's just that
I'm used to having

20:26.990 --> 20:28.912
smaller, more
low-key birthdays.

20:28.960 --> 20:31.258
- But you want
this party, right?

20:31.290 --> 20:33.827
- Yes. Yes, totally.

20:33.860 --> 20:35.794
Mom's so excited and you've
done all this planning,

20:35.830 --> 20:37.798
so of course.
It's gonna be great.

20:54.080 --> 20:56.674
- Hey, Zoe.
- Hey.

20:58.850 --> 21:01.284
- My brand new bucket list.

21:01.320 --> 21:03.379
Organized by decade,

21:03.430 --> 21:05.887
separated into categories:

21:05.930 --> 21:07.921
travel, learning,
career, relationships--

21:07.960 --> 21:11.418
- Nice! Wait. You don't
know how to ice skate?

21:11.470 --> 21:14.439
- I never learned.
See? I've done nothing!

21:14.470 --> 21:15.767
- What's all this
under relationship?

21:15.800 --> 21:18.633
OK. I can't unsee that.

21:18.670 --> 21:21.309
- I am expanding my horizons.
- I'd say so.

21:21.340 --> 21:23.444
- Thanks.

21:24.880 --> 21:27.644
- He already left for the ER.

21:27.680 --> 21:29.875
- Ah. What's that,
four nights this week?

21:29.920 --> 21:32.081
Seems a little more
than 'casual' to me.

21:32.120 --> 21:34.953
Have
you figured out if she's coming

21:34.990 --> 21:36.912
to Jules' birthday yet?

21:39.860 --> 21:43.398
- So...

21:43.430 --> 21:45.864
this is all about
Carl White, huh?
- Yeah,

21:45.900 --> 21:48.767
I looked into him.
Machinist for 30 years,

21:48.800 --> 21:50.768
diagnosed with lung cancer
three years ago.

21:54.940 --> 21:57.033
- He might have a life insurance
policy through his union.

21:57.080 --> 21:59.048
- Huh. We should
ask Jon about that.

21:59.080 --> 22:01.617
You know what else?
We should find out

22:01.650 --> 22:03.538
if he had any other visitors
in the hospital in the past
few weeks.

22:03.590 --> 22:05.945
- On it!
- OK, we gotta go.

22:08.890 --> 22:11.927
Oh... That one's overrated,
but definitely try that one.

22:27.410 --> 22:29.537
- Thanks so much for meeting us
on such short notice, Jon.

22:29.580 --> 22:31.548
- Still no word
on my father's body?

22:31.580 --> 22:34.117
- No. Sorry.
- I don't get why anyone

22:34.150 --> 22:36.675
would want to steal a dead body.

22:36.720 --> 22:40.383
Especially my dad's. It's been
hard enough losing him once.

22:40.420 --> 22:43.480
This has been a real
gut punch for my family.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.782
- You're an only
child, right, Jon?
- Yeah. It was just me and Carl

22:45.830 --> 22:49.027
for a long time.
He moved in with my mom

22:49.060 --> 22:51.893
when I was eight.
My biological father was never

22:51.930 --> 22:55.138
in the picture. My mom died
shortly after they were married.

22:55.170 --> 22:58.765
Carl officially adopted me
and raised me alone.

22:58.810 --> 23:01.438
- Did Carl have any other
family?
- No.

23:01.480 --> 23:04.176
He was estranged from his
family. And as close as we were,

23:04.210 --> 23:06.178
he was always fiercely private

23:06.210 --> 23:08.417
about his life growing up.

23:08.450 --> 23:10.645
- Can you think of anyone
who'd want to harm your father?

23:10.690 --> 23:14.012
- We think someone

23:14.060 --> 23:16.153
stole Carl's body to get rid
of forensic evidence,

23:16.190 --> 23:18.681
possibly to cover up a crime.
- That's ridiculous.

23:18.730 --> 23:20.948
Everyone loved my dad.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.696
- I have to ask where you were
last night. It's protocol.

23:26.630 --> 23:28.689
Killed him and tried
to cover it up?

23:30.570 --> 23:33.471
- Inheritance.
That's a good one.

23:33.510 --> 23:35.501
Carl was broke. He spent
everything he had

23:35.540 --> 23:37.906
on experimental
cancer treatments.

23:37.950 --> 23:40.919
I've been putting him up
for the past year.
Remortgaged my house twice

23:40.950 --> 23:42.838
to pay for his medical bills.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.986
The only thing
I'm inheriting is this.

23:46.020 --> 23:49.615
It's the box of Carl's
things I told you about.

23:49.660 --> 23:52.629
- Thank you for bringing it.
- Literally everything
he left behind.

24:10.650 --> 24:12.504
- Carl's mother.
I never knew her.

24:15.020 --> 24:17.944
- It's a text from Zoe.

24:17.990 --> 24:20.914
Carl didn't have any
unexpected visitors,

24:20.960 --> 24:24.020
but three days before he died,
he asked a nurse to
call him a cab.

24:26.030 --> 24:28.897
- To 145 Adelaide St. West.

24:28.930 --> 24:32.093
The nurses tried to talk him out
of it, but he was determined,

24:32.130 --> 24:34.496
despite how sick he was.
- Why would my dad need
to go downtown?

24:36.570 --> 24:39.130
: Donne...

24:39.170 --> 24:41.832
as in Donne's Rye Whislq?

24:41.880 --> 24:44.701
- One of the hundred wealthiest
families in Canada.

24:44.750 --> 24:47.674
I did a commercial
for them back in the 90s.
- I'll make fun of that later.

24:47.720 --> 24:50.518
How the hell are the Donnes
connected to Carl?

24:56.160 --> 24:58.754
- Can I get you
something to drink?

24:58.790 --> 25:02.294
We've been developing
a brand new blend.

25:02.330 --> 25:04.560
- No, thank you, Mr. Donne.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.864
- Reginald, please.

25:06.900 --> 25:08.891
You can call me Reg.
- Sorry to disturb you,

25:08.940 --> 25:11.704
but we wanted to ask you
about Carl White.

25:11.740 --> 25:15.779
- 605, former machinist...

25:15.810 --> 25:18.199
Came to visit you
about a week ago?
- Never seen him before.

25:18.250 --> 25:21.674
I guess I thought,
because you let us in

25:21.720 --> 25:23.278
_as soon as we mentioned
his name, that you knew him.

25:23.320 --> 25:26.016
- No, I...

25:26.050 --> 25:28.018
I heard
The Shadow was here.

25:28.060 --> 25:32.087
_ 1997. You_were
in a commerCIal for us.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.598
- "Take the journey home."

25:36.630 --> 25:40.066
- That's right.
- Yup.
- Look,

25:40.100 --> 25:42.239
I'd love
to help you out,

25:42.270 --> 25:45.068
but I have no idea

25:45.110 --> 25:47.999
who that man is.
- Sure.

25:48.040 --> 25:50.747
Well, thank you for your time.
- Oh, uh,

25:50.780 --> 25:52.839
take a bottle.

25:52.880 --> 25:55.576
On me.
- Thanks.

25:57.920 --> 26:00.912
Nice guy, huh? Free bottle
of whislq. Heh, heh, heh.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.155
- Something about him.
I feel like he's playing us.

26:03.190 --> 26:04.987
- Yeah. Yeah, I get
that vibe too.

26:07.360 --> 26:10.591
Whoa. That photo.

26:10.630 --> 26:13.190
That's the same one

26:13.230 --> 26:17.098
from Carl's personal effects.
Of his mom, Vera.
- "Donne Employee Photo, 1951."

26:17.140 --> 26:18.960
- Carl's mom worked
for the Donnes?

26:19.010 --> 26:21.706
- There's no way that
that's a coincidence.

26:21.740 --> 26:23.901
Carl was here.
Ol' Reggie just lied to us.

26:23.950 --> 26:26.601
- Why would a dying man
come all the way down here

26:26.650 --> 26:28.777
to talk with his mom's
former employer?
- I don't know,

26:28.820 --> 26:31.038
but we're not going to get
a straight answer out of him.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.285
Wasn't there a name on the back
of Jon's photo?
- Yeah.

26:33.320 --> 26:35.652
Yeah, Harriette Somebody.
- OK.

26:35.690 --> 26:37.726
I'll call Jon. Here's hoping
Harriette Somebody

26:37.760 --> 26:40.285
is still alive.

26:40.330 --> 26:43.128
- Look at how young we all
looked! That's Kathy,

26:43.160 --> 26:45.697
Anthony, Sandra,

26:45.730 --> 26:47.937
Betsy, and...

26:47.970 --> 26:50.962
Oh my lord, Vera White.

26:53.010 --> 26:55.706
- She worked at_ the desk
next to mine.

26:55.740 --> 26:57.844
She was a lovely girl.

26:57.880 --> 27:00.849
Then she left suddenly,
in the spring

27:00.880 --> 27:03.986
of 1951, I think.
Yes, that was it.

27:04.020 --> 27:06.181
Poor girl.

27:06.220 --> 27:08.984
Mrs. Donne all
but chased her away.

27:09.020 --> 27:12.888
- Well, it was all
gossip, of course,

27:12.930 --> 27:15.751
but Theodore Donne,
the company owner,

27:15.800 --> 27:17.825
used to spend a great deal
of time at Vera's desk.

27:17.870 --> 27:20.395
He was always
asking her

27:20.430 --> 27:24.662
to stay late or work on
the weekends... I suspect

27:24.710 --> 27:26.962
that Mrs. Donne found out
and chased Vera away.

27:27.010 --> 27:29.729
- Spring of 1951, you said.

27:29.780 --> 27:32.169
Do you remember which month?
- Um,

27:32.210 --> 27:36.078
Oh, it was early May, I think.
It was not long after this
picture was taken.

27:43.160 --> 27:46.357
- Theodore Donne, Reg's father,

27:46.390 --> 27:48.893
was having an affair
with Vera White.

27:48.930 --> 27:51.819
- Vera was sent away
in May of 1951.

27:51.870 --> 27:54.088
Carl was born in October
that same year,

27:54.140 --> 27:56.392
roughly six months later.

27:56.440 --> 27:59.807
- Wait, are you saying what
I think you're saying?
- Carl White

27:59.840 --> 28:02.104
was Theodore's son.

28:02.140 --> 28:04.244
- Reg's half-brother.

28:13.390 --> 28:16.086
- OK, 1951: Vera gets pregnant

28:16.120 --> 28:19.920
with Theodore Donne's child, and
gets sent away by Mrs. Donne.

28:19.960 --> 28:21.723
- Six months later,
she gives birth to Carl.

28:21.760 --> 28:23.921
- Which means Carl White
is Carl Donne.

28:23.970 --> 28:27.224
- And entitled to his share
of the Donne family fortune.

28:27.270 --> 28:29.192
- If I had to guess,

28:29.240 --> 28:31.208
15 million.
- Holy kumquat!

28:31.240 --> 28:34.505
A titch off, boss.
- 400 million.

28:34.540 --> 28:38.078
They only paid me
five grand for that
whisky commercial!

28:38.110 --> 28:41.113
- We need to find that body.

28:41.150 --> 28:44.278
- Why wouldn't Carl ask
for the money earlier?
- Maybe he didn't want it.

28:44.320 --> 28:46.288
Come on,
it's not so crazy.

28:46.320 --> 28:49.118
The Donne family basically
chased his mother away.

28:49.160 --> 28:52.084
Carl probably wanted
nothing to do with it.

28:52.130 --> 28:54.223
- Because of Jon.

28:54.260 --> 28:57.866
Jon had to remortgage his house
twice to pay for Carl's
medical bills.

28:57.900 --> 29:00.937
- Four-year-old daughter,
another one on the way...
- If it was me, I'd want

29:00.970 --> 29:02.790
to make sure my family
was tak%1Kca re of.

29:02.840 --> 29:05.001
so Carl goes to see Reginald
before he dies,

29:05.040 --> 29:08.168
asks him to take care of his
family once he's gone.
- Except Reg

29:08.210 --> 29:11.509
isn't having it. He figures
Carl's on his death bed anyway.

29:11.550 --> 29:13.506
- OK, but why doesn't Jon
just go get it now?

29:13.550 --> 29:16.371
- Because Carl and Jon
don't share the same DNA.

29:16.420 --> 29:18.945
Carl isn't Jon's
biological father,

29:18.990 --> 29:22.414
which is why Reggie
switched the bodies.
- You're right.

29:22.460 --> 29:25.179
Because if Carl were buried,
then Jon could dig up
the body at any point

29:25.230 --> 29:27.482
to test for DNA and claim
his share of the Donne fortune.

29:27.530 --> 29:30.192
- But if the body
gets cremated,

29:30.230 --> 29:33.461
supposedly by accident...
- The link goes away. Forever.

29:33.500 --> 29:35.468
- Well, what're you guys
waiting for?

29:35.500 --> 29:37.297
Go get Reginald Donne
so we can find Carl!

29:41.140 --> 29:43.506
- We know he's behind this.
We just can't prove it.
- So you want me

29:43.540 --> 29:46.270
to execute a search warrant
on one of the most powerful
men in the city,

29:46.310 --> 29:49.040
in the hopes of finding
a dead body stashed in,

29:49.080 --> 29:51.878
let's say his walk
- Yeah. Exactly.

29:51.920 --> 29:54.184
- Like, tonight.
His funeral's tomorrow.

29:54.220 --> 29:57.109
- This is a great idea.
You know what, while I'm at it,

29:57.160 --> 29:59.583
why don't I build a catapult
so that my boss can literally

29:59.630 --> 30:03.054
launch me into space when
this thing falls apart?

30:03.100 --> 30:06.194
- What about the break-in at
the Kalfas Funeral Home?

30:06.230 --> 30:09.199
- There's gotta be something
to implicate Reginald Donne.
- Here.

30:09.240 --> 30:12.539
Analysis came back a few hours
ago. The scene was clean,

30:12.570 --> 30:15.209
no blood, no DNA,
no fingerprints. The only
thing the techs found

30:15.240 --> 30:17.231
was a little latex fiber
on some shards of glass.

30:17.280 --> 30:19.100
- Yeah, from the rubber gloves

30:19.150 --> 30:21.573
the culprit used
to rob the place.
- Wait a minute.

30:21.620 --> 30:24.987
The tox screen shows traces of
formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde,
and methanol.

30:25.020 --> 30:27.545
- Am I supposed to know
what those things are?

30:27.590 --> 30:30.218
- You would if you were a
mortician_. Those are chemicals
used in embalming fIUId.

30:32.030 --> 30:34.123
- I don't understand.

30:34.160 --> 30:37.596
So you're saying
the break
- The gloves used in the robbery

30:37.630 --> 30:41.066
had trace amounts of
embalming fluid on them.

30:41.100 --> 30:44.001
- Well, Hanna and I
are the only ones who have
access to those chemicals,

30:44.040 --> 30:47.134
and we have no reason
to break into our own place.

30:48.980 --> 30:51.642
- Hanna,

30:51.680 --> 30:54.945
did Reginald Donne pay you
to switch Carl White's body

30:54.980 --> 30:57.369
with Leo's?
- That's ridiculous.
Of course not.

31:05.330 --> 31:07.184
- Say something.

31:07.230 --> 31:10.495
- Jacinta...

31:13.030 --> 31:14.998
Wait,
are you saying--

31:15.040 --> 31:17.907
- We've been losing money
for over a year!

31:17.940 --> 31:19.532
We haven't been able
to take a salary in months.

31:19.570 --> 31:22.573
We shouldn't have
to live like this.

31:22.610 --> 31:25.602
- Tell us what happened.

31:25.650 --> 31:28.539
- Mr. Donne came to me
when he figured out

31:28.580 --> 31:31.640
that we were one of the funeral
homes that dealt with
Memorial Hospital.

31:31.690 --> 31:34.682
He offered me

31:34.720 --> 31:37.211
two hundred grand
to switch the toe tags

31:37.260 --> 31:40.058
and take
Carl White's body

31:40.090 --> 31:43.127
instead of Leo's.

31:43.160 --> 31:46.163
- I didn't ask any questions.

31:46.200 --> 31:49.033
But when I called to tell him
that the switch had been
discovered,

31:49.070 --> 31:52.631
he threatened to expose me
if I didn't dispose of the body.

31:52.670 --> 31:54.900
- So you made it look like
a break-in, took the body
and got rid of it.

31:56.740 --> 32:01.211
- I did it for you!

32:01.250 --> 32:05.118
You've wanted to_do this
Since you were a little girl.

32:05.150 --> 32:08.711
You love this world.
But it was never what I wanted.

32:11.190 --> 32:14.455
I couldn't just walk out on you
when the business was failing.

32:14.500 --> 32:17.060
- It's better
than taking a payoff.
- That two hundred grand

32:17.100 --> 32:20.558
was going to pay our debts,
allow me to move on.

32:20.600 --> 32:24.434
I'd finally be free of
everyone's expectations.

32:31.510 --> 32:35.071
Hanna Kalfas,
you are under arrest

32:35.120 --> 32:37.315
for committing Indignity
to a Dead Human Body

32:37.350 --> 32:41.286
and for Felony Disorderly
Conduct in Staging a Robbery.

32:43.490 --> 32:47.551
- I can't believe you did this.
- Wait-- Hanna, what did you do
with Carl's body?

32:47.590 --> 32:50.354
- I dropped him off
at the crematorium

32:50.400 --> 32:53.460
at Ash Field cemetery.

33:17.420 --> 33:21.527
- He's in the back.

33:21.560 --> 33:23.755
- Oh, thank god.

33:30.470 --> 33:32.438
- Here you go.

33:44.190 --> 33:47.079
- Okay, thank you for your time.

33:47.120 --> 33:49.680
- Zilch. The hospital room
was scrubbed clean.

33:49.720 --> 33:51.824
- I can't believe
there's not a trace

33:51.860 --> 33:54.829
of Carl's DNA left.
- Just like that,

33:54.860 --> 33:59.092
he's wiped from existence with
no proof that he's a Donne heir.

33:59.130 --> 34:03.066
What is that?
- Oh, right.

34:03.100 --> 34:06.365
I was saving this for
a less depressive time,

34:06.410 --> 34:09.277
but maybe we could all use
a good laugh right now.

34:17.320 --> 34:19.345
- Life is an exotic journey.

34:19.390 --> 34:21.711
Always something new to see...

34:21.760 --> 34:24.581
to try... to succeed
or fail at...

34:24.630 --> 34:26.655
But no matter how far you go...

34:26.690 --> 34:30.399
remember there's value in
the familiar things as well.

34:30.430 --> 34:32.625
Take the journey home.

34:36.770 --> 34:40.467
- You know, the best part
is the unlit cigar.
- I think it's the frosted tips.

34:43.540 --> 34:45.701
- That's it.

34:45.750 --> 34:48.719
- The cigar.
We gotta talk to Jon.

34:51.350 --> 34:55.150
Life is an exotic journey.

34:55.190 --> 34:58.523
Always something new
to see... to try...

34:58.560 --> 35:00.221
to succeed or fail at...

35:13.240 --> 35:16.698
- This is all a bit
overwhelming. You wanna do what

35:16.740 --> 35:19.743
with the pipe?
- We're gonna test it for DNA.

35:19.780 --> 35:22.647
- Y-STR DNA. It's DNA
specifically passed on

35:22.680 --> 35:24.545
from a male to
their male offspring.

35:24.590 --> 35:27.411
Now, if we can prove that
Carl's matches Reginald's--

35:27.450 --> 35:30.556
- Then it would prove
that Car! is Theodore
Donne's biological son.

35:30.590 --> 35:32.524
- And according to the terms
of Theodore Donne's will,

35:32.560 --> 35:35.597
his estate was to be divided
equally among all heirs.

35:35.630 --> 35:37.598
- Your father had claim
to part of the Donne empire.

35:37.630 --> 35:40.190
And as his only son,
now that claim falls to you.

35:40.230 --> 35:43.495
Look, here's the number
for a friend of mine,

35:43.540 --> 35:46.361
Melanie Parker. She's a
prosecutor, but she can help

35:46.410 --> 35:48.901
set you up
with a civil attorney.
- But get ready for the fight

35:48.940 --> 35:52.171
of your life, because
Reginald Donne is not going
to take this lying down.

35:52.210 --> 35:55.213
- You're gonna need money
for legal fees, and lots of it.

35:55.250 --> 35:57.377
Or you could try
for a contingency lawyer,

35:57.420 --> 36:00.639
but they generally ask for 50%
of your claim.
- Hold on.

36:00.690 --> 36:03.454
Sorry. Do I have
to do this?

36:05.660 --> 36:09.391
- It's just...

36:10.630 --> 36:12.689
It seems like a long shot.

36:12.730 --> 36:15.198
Reginald Donne
is a powerful man.

36:15.240 --> 36:17.196
And I'm already
swimming in debt.

36:17.240 --> 36:19.435
- All we want right now
is to keep our house.

36:19.470 --> 36:21.529
- The stress
of a trial...

36:21.580 --> 36:24.276
isn't worth it
for us.

36:24.310 --> 36:25.902
We're fine.

36:25.950 --> 36:27.975
Really.

36:28.010 --> 36:30.570
We live a humble
life, but...

36:30.620 --> 36:32.941
we're happy.

36:32.990 --> 36:35.618
Do you want
to think about it?

36:38.690 --> 36:41.523
- "You only get one life.

36:41.560 --> 36:43.824
You may as well
live it right."

36:43.860 --> 36:46.693
My... my dad
taught me that.

36:46.730 --> 36:49.335
Thank you, though.

36:49.370 --> 36:51.838
For everything.

37:00.880 --> 37:03.713
- I can't say
I blame them.

37:03.750 --> 37:05.980
I wouldn't want to take _on
Reginald Donne in court either.

37:17.400 --> 37:19.368
- Hello, Reg.

37:19.400 --> 37:21.368
- Shadow.

37:21.400 --> 37:24.039
In the shadows.

37:24.070 --> 37:26.959
Should I be concerned?
- I just came here to talk.

37:27.010 --> 37:29.376
To tell you

37:29.410 --> 37:31.901
that Jon's family won't be
pursuing any legal action
against you.

37:31.950 --> 37:34.271
- Smart man.
- Not just smart.

37:34.320 --> 37:36.880
An honest man. A family man.

37:36.920 --> 37:39.548
Like his father.
Your half-brother.

37:39.590 --> 37:42.684
- Nice try.
Are you wearing a wire?

37:42.720 --> 37:46.383
Trying to get me to admit
something on tape?

37:46.430 --> 37:49.627
- Jon doesn't want your money.
- Then what is there
to talk about?

37:51.830 --> 37:55.368
- All Car! wanted was
to take care of his family.

37:55.400 --> 37:57.368
How much did he
ask you for, Reg?

37:57.400 --> 38:00.528
Three hundred
grand

38:00.570 --> 38:02.709
Come on, that's
a rounding error.

38:02.740 --> 38:04.708
All so his kid
wouldn't get stuck

38:04.750 --> 38:06.775
with the burden
of his medical bills.

38:06.810 --> 38:10.678
- It's a sad story, I admit--
- You know Jon is barely
hanging onto his house?

38:10.720 --> 38:14.315
He took a pay cut so he could
spend more time with his dad,

38:14.360 --> 38:16.385
despite the fact that he's got
a kid of his own and another one

38:16.420 --> 38:18.285
on the way. That's
what families do.

38:20.460 --> 38:22.792
I guess you wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

38:25.600 --> 38:29.661
Hang on, Reg. I got
something for ya.

38:32.710 --> 38:34.678
- It's Carl's pipe.

38:34.710 --> 38:38.032
One of his most
cherished possessmns.

38:38.080 --> 38:41.618
And the last remaining piece
of his DNA on this planet.

38:41.650 --> 38:43.914
You decide which
of those descriptions

38:43.950 --> 38:46.589
means the most to you.

38:57.530 --> 39:00.761
- The venue called.
They said that you forgot
to drop off the cheque.

39:00.800 --> 39:03.132
They've cancelled
the reservation.

39:03.170 --> 39:05.536
- Mom, it's fine.

39:05.570 --> 39:08.471
There's over a hundred kids
that are gonna be showing up
to that hall

39:08.510 --> 39:12.469
in four hours!
- And I'll put up a message on
Facebook saying it's cancelled.

39:12.510 --> 39:14.842
Everyone will survive.

39:14.880 --> 39:18.509
- You were right, Becca. I
couldn't handle it. I dropped
the ball. It's all my fault.

39:18.550 --> 39:21.451
- I knew it!
Why did I trust you--
- No. Wait. Mom.

39:22.960 --> 39:26.384
He did it on purpose.

39:26.430 --> 39:28.648
- It's OK, Jules--
- No, it's not.

39:30.060 --> 39:32.620
Don't be mad.

39:32.670 --> 39:34.763
I didn't want the party.

39:37.700 --> 39:40.100
I know,
and I thought I did.

39:40.140 --> 39:42.779
But you guys were so
excited to plan it, and...

39:42.810 --> 39:45.938
It's just not me.
I'm sorry.

39:48.920 --> 39:51.582
- No. No, I'm sorry.

39:53.520 --> 39:55.852
I should have realized.

39:55.890 --> 40:00.020
- We both should have.
Good news is,

40:00.060 --> 40:02.597
now you can have the party
you really want, right?

40:02.630 --> 40:05.793
And beer.

40:05.830 --> 40:09.459
: No.

40:17.080 --> 40:19.503
- I saw I missed your call,
what's up?

40:19.550 --> 40:21.518
- Listen,

40:21.550 --> 40:24.815
I wanted to explain
about Jules' birthday.
- Matt--

40:27.020 --> 40:30.114
I'm really looking forward
to meeting Jules...
when you're ready.

40:32.560 --> 40:35.120
- I appreciate that. Thanks.

40:35.160 --> 40:37.128
- You're welcome.

40:37.160 --> 40:39.924
Talk to you soon.

40:39.970 --> 40:43.235
- We say that the hour of death

40:43.270 --> 40:47.001
cannot be forecast,

40:47.040 --> 40:50.237
but when we say this

40:50.280 --> 40:52.840
we imagine that hour
as being placed

40:52.880 --> 40:55.872
in an obscure
and distant future.

40:58.080 --> 41:00.981
It _never occurs to us_
that it has any connection

41:01.020 --> 41:04.478
with the day already begun...

41:06.630 --> 41:08.894
- Guess he had
a change of heart.

41:15.100 --> 41:17.239
- We are thankful,

41:17.270 --> 41:19.238
we are grateful,

41:19.270 --> 41:21.579
and we are better--

41:21.610 --> 41:23.771
because of his love.

41:25.750 --> 41:29.868
- ** But we are acting
like we're children *

41:29.920 --> 41:33.913
* Looking to blame
for what we lack *

41:33.950 --> 41:37.886
* Before we lose everything

41:37.920 --> 41:41.151
* We have tomorrow

41:41.190 --> 41:45.160
* Can we forget what
went wrong yesterday *

41:45.200 --> 41:48.260
* Darling

41:48.300 --> 41:50.939
* The world isn't over yet

41:50.970 --> 41:53.006
* We've still got a chance
to place our bets *

41:53.040 --> 41:55.736
* We both made a little mess

41:55.780 --> 41:59.648
* Nothing our two hearts
can't put back *

41:59.680 --> 42:01.841
* I'll never love you less

42:01.880 --> 42:04.246
* Don't let your worries
second guess *

42:04.280 --> 42:05.941
* We'll start over fresh

42:05.990 --> 42:10.780
* Living a life
with no regrets *

42:12.930 --> 42:16.093
* Living a life
with no regrets *

42:19.670 --> 42:21.991
- Yeah, it's me.
- Just open a bottle of wine,
I'll be out in a sec.

42:24.200 --> 42:29.103
- * Thinking that time
has passed you by *

42:31.610 --> 42:36.809
* And you're not close
to where you said you'd be *

42:36.850 --> 42:41.014
* But tell me,
who is in this life? *

42:41.050 --> 42:46.124
* Before we lose everything
we have tomorrow *

42:46.160 --> 42:49.755
* Can we forget
what went wrong *

42:49.800 --> 42:52.018
* Yesterday?

42:52.070 --> 42:53.765
* So darling

42:53.800 --> 42:56.098
* The world isn't over yet

42:56.140 --> 42:59.029
* We've still got a chance
to place our bets *

42:59.070 --> 43:01.368
- Hey, so you remember
that old vintage jacket
you fell in love with

43:01.410 --> 43:04.607
years ago in Kensington Market?

43:04.650 --> 43:08.711
I was on Queen West the other
day, and you're not gonna
believe this, but...

43:08.750 --> 43:11.981
- * Don't let your worries
second guess, we'll start
over fresh *

43:12.020 --> 43:16.912
* Living a life
with no regrets *

43:16.960 --> 43:21.124
* Living a life with
no regrets *

43:25.400 --> 43:28.324
* The world isn't over

43:28.370 --> 43:31.134
* We can always start over

43:31.170 --> 43:35.072
* No weight on our shoulder *
