00:06.000 --> 00:08.900
    Sam.                        

00:09.000 --> 00:11.100
  Sorry, they were out of beer  
nuts and pretzels at the store, 

00:11.200 --> 00:13.900
     but guess what I got?      

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
          Choco Puffs.          

00:16.100 --> 00:18.300
Hey-hey.                        
                 Hey, all right.

00:18.400 --> 00:19.700
    Haven't had these           
    since I was a kid.          

00:19.800 --> 00:21.100
                          CLIFF:
              Hey, look at this.

00:21.200 --> 00:25.100
Uh, "90% real sugar,            
ten percent animal fat."        

00:25.100 --> 00:28.000
God bless America, huh?         

00:29.400 --> 00:31.800
I always liked eating mine      
straight from the box.          

00:31.800 --> 00:33.100
They still have prizes          
in these things?                

00:33.200 --> 00:34.400
                 Boy, I hope so.

00:34.500 --> 00:35.900
                 I remember when
                    I was a kid,

00:36.000 --> 00:38.600
        I got one of those lick-
         and-stick tattoo books.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.500
         Never wore them though.

00:40.600 --> 00:41.700
    Felt pretty silly, huh?     

00:41.700 --> 00:45.300
            No, I'm just waiting
         for a special occasion.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.200
             Yep, I got a prize.

00:48.300 --> 00:50.200
Me, too. Dumb BB game.          

00:50.200 --> 00:52.200
    Yeah, I got one of those    
      cheap plastic rings.      

00:52.200 --> 00:56.100
              Oh, great, another
                    tattoo book.

00:56.200 --> 00:57.200
    (coughs)                    

00:57.300 --> 00:58.200
                  Let's see what
                    Cliffie got.

00:59.800 --> 01:02.000
    Hey, Cliffie got skunked.   

01:02.100 --> 01:03.400

01:14.400 --> 01:17.500
                  Oh, Mr. Clavin
                got the whistle.

01:17.600 --> 01:21.300

02:33.100 --> 02:34.200
How's your throat               
doing there, Cliffie?           

02:34.200 --> 02:35.300
 It's still a little sore, Sam. 

02:35.400 --> 02:36.600
                    Oh, well,   

02:36.700 --> 02:38.500
             here's something we
        used to do in my family.

02:38.500 --> 02:40.900
        Ah! Ah!                 

02:41.000 --> 02:42.700
 You did that for sore throats? 

02:42.800 --> 02:44.500
                        No.     

02:49.900 --> 02:51.200
    Sam...                      

02:51.300 --> 02:53.400
        What...?                

02:53.500 --> 02:55.500
  My hatcheck girl is missing   
         from her post.         

02:55.600 --> 02:57.500
You haven't perchance seen her? 

02:57.600 --> 02:59.100
 What's that supposed to mean?  
Every time something goes wrong 

02:59.200 --> 03:00.600
    in your restaurant          
         it's my fault?         

03:00.700 --> 03:02.100
Like I'm the one who's supposed 
         to keep track          

03:02.200 --> 03:03.400
     of all your employees?     

03:03.400 --> 03:05.300
        You know,               
that really ticks me off.       

03:05.300 --> 03:09.400
 Sam, I can't get the sofa bed  
        to fold back up.        

03:13.400 --> 03:15.100
        Miss Kenderson.         

03:15.100 --> 03:17.700
For the three weeks             
you've been in my employ        

03:17.800 --> 03:21.000
as a hatcheck girl, you've spent
 most of your time downstairs.  

03:21.100 --> 03:22.900
 Today, as luck would have it,  

03:23.000 --> 03:25.400
we actually had a customer      
          with a hat.           

03:27.300 --> 03:28.500
      And where were you?       

03:28.600 --> 03:30.200
    Taking a break.             

03:30.300 --> 03:31.400
It wasn't your break time.      

03:31.400 --> 03:33.100
                    It was mine.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.700
        Miss Kenderson,         
    you're terminated.          

03:34.800 --> 03:36.000
 Get your things and clear out. 

03:36.100 --> 03:37.300
    Fine.                       

03:38.400 --> 03:41.100
Sam, in the future,             
I'd appreciate you              

03:41.200 --> 03:45.300
keeping your hands off          
my hatcheck girls.              

03:45.400 --> 03:46.700
        You know,               
  it's your own stupid fault.   

03:46.800 --> 03:48.100
    I mean, I wouldn't touch    
      your hatcheck girls       

03:48.200 --> 03:50.400
 if you'd hire some waitresses. 

03:51.700 --> 03:53.800
          Hello, all.           

03:53.900 --> 03:55.600
Happy birthday, Dr. Crane.      

03:55.700 --> 03:57.000
     Why, thank you, Woody.     

03:57.100 --> 03:58.500
    How did you know?           

03:58.500 --> 04:00.200
Well, you left your wallet here 
          last night,           

04:00.200 --> 04:02.200
  so I was looking through it   
to find out whose it was.       

04:04.000 --> 04:05.800
  Are you really gonna donate   
      your internal organs      

04:05.800 --> 04:07.600
            in case of accident?

04:07.700 --> 04:09.900
        They take them before   
              you die, you know.

04:13.400 --> 04:15.000
         Yeah, my uncle was just
             in a fender bender.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.700
            They chased him half
             way down the block.

04:19.800 --> 04:22.300
        Well, thank you         
    for sharing that with me    

04:22.400 --> 04:26.000
    on my, uh, special day.     

04:28.200 --> 04:30.400
                So, you got some
                big plans, here?

04:30.500 --> 04:31.700
    Oh, nothing much.           

04:31.800 --> 04:35.100
  I've never been one of those  
who tend to make a big brouhaha.

04:35.100 --> 04:37.200
    As my mother always used    
          to tell me,           

04:37.200 --> 04:38.600
      "Don't get excited.       

04:38.700 --> 04:41.700
     It's just another day      
         of the year."          

04:45.300 --> 04:47.300
              You're kidding me,
        you never had parties   
            when you were a kid?

04:47.400 --> 04:49.200
                Friends over?   
            Cakes? Ice cream?   

04:49.300 --> 04:50.700
              No.               

04:50.800 --> 04:54.600
  Well, once I had a... a bran  
muffin with a pat of oleo.      

04:57.200 --> 04:58.600
        Hey, you know something,
             hey, I got an idea.

04:58.700 --> 05:01.400
             Let's throw Frasier
              a party here, huh?

05:01.400 --> 05:03.200
      You know, the bash that he
     never had, what do you say?

05:03.300 --> 05:05.100
    Yeah. Great idea.           
         (all agreeing)         

05:05.100 --> 05:06.300
     Afternoon, everybody.      

05:06.400 --> 05:07.800
              ALL:              
             Norm!              

05:07.900 --> 05:09.600
 What's going on, Mr. Peterson? 

05:09.700 --> 05:11.800
         Another layer          
     for the winter, Wood.      

05:15.400 --> 05:16.800
             CLIFF:             
    Hey, Norm, did you hear?    

05:16.900 --> 05:19.200
    We're gonna have a big,     
    uh, birthday bash there     

05:19.200 --> 05:21.900
 for Doc Fras.                  
                    Yeah, great.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.300
         Hey, it'll be exciting,
                Mr. Peterson.   

05:23.400 --> 05:25.800
                We're gonna have
             cake and ice cream.

05:25.900 --> 05:29.600
Yeah, we can go crazy and order 
from Pizza-Pizza-Pizza-Pizza.   

05:29.700 --> 05:31.400
                Oh, what do they
                    serve there?

05:33.400 --> 05:35.600
Pizza, you dweeb.               

05:35.700 --> 05:37.000
            You don't have to   
            bite my head off.   

05:37.100 --> 05:40.200
                 I've never been
                there before.   

05:40.300 --> 05:41.100
             I don't know, guys.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.800
             I'm just not in the
            mood for a party.   

05:42.800 --> 05:45.300
            I got some bad news.
What?                           

05:45.400 --> 05:47.900
              Vera lost her job.

05:47.900 --> 05:49.600
         (all groaning)         
                          CLIFF:
                  Her, too, huh?

05:49.600 --> 05:51.400
      Boy, this recession       
     is hitting everybody.      

05:51.400 --> 05:53.700
  Well, they should have gone   
          for the gold          

05:53.800 --> 05:55.700
    and gotten the security     
      of a government job.      

05:55.800 --> 05:57.000
      Yeah, I'll tell you,      

05:57.100 --> 05:59.000
I could spit on that mail       
  and chuck it down the sewer,  

05:59.100 --> 06:02.400
and they couldn't fire me.      

06:02.500 --> 06:04.200
                 How do you know
            that, Mr. Clavin?   

06:05.100 --> 06:07.400
        I-I don't.              

06:07.500 --> 06:10.600
 How about those Celtics, huh?  

06:10.700 --> 06:13.000
It's too bad, man,              
about Vera losing her job.      

06:13.100 --> 06:14.300
                        NORM:   
                        Yeah.   

06:14.400 --> 06:17.100
         We have, like, no money
            coming in at all.   

06:17.200 --> 06:20.500
  If something doesn't happen   
soon, I may have to find a job. 

06:23.300 --> 06:25.200
 You gonna work, Norm?          

06:25.300 --> 06:27.400
                I mean for Vera.

06:27.400 --> 06:30.700
         "You gonna work, Norm?"

06:32.000 --> 06:33.200
        Hi, guys.               

06:33.200 --> 06:34.700
                    Oh, Rebecca,
                  there you are.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.400
  I've been looking everywhere  
            for you.            

06:36.500 --> 06:37.500
  What are you talking about?   

06:37.500 --> 06:39.500
You're just sitting there       
    on your bar stool.          

06:39.600 --> 06:42.100
            I know.             
This is where I look from.      

06:42.200 --> 06:43.800
So what do you need, Norm?      

06:43.900 --> 06:45.000
        Well, it's Vera.        

06:45.100 --> 06:47.200
     She was, uh, laid off      
down at the travel agency.      

06:47.300 --> 06:49.200
 Oh, so you want me to see if I 
can use my corporate connections

06:49.200 --> 06:50.600
    to get her another job?     

06:50.700 --> 06:52.100
                    No.         

06:52.200 --> 06:53.900
  You want me to help her out   
 with some professional resume? 

06:54.000 --> 06:55.200
            Well, no.           

06:55.300 --> 06:56.500
    What do you want, Norm?     

06:56.600 --> 06:58.000
             Well, you see,     

06:58.100 --> 07:00.900
Vera ripped off a bunch of these
    frequent flyer vouchers.    

07:01.000 --> 07:03.900
 And I was wondering if I could 
 trade them in for free beers.  

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
    (scoffs)                    

07:05.100 --> 07:08.100
                     What? What?

07:08.100 --> 07:10.200
         Okay, somebody's got to
          go get all this stuff.

07:10.300 --> 07:11.500
            I want ice cream,   
        balloons, decorations...

07:11.500 --> 07:12.900
I nominate Frasier.             

07:13.000 --> 07:14.400
I second.                       
             All in favor.      

07:14.600 --> 07:15.700
              ALL:              
              Aye!              

07:15.700 --> 07:18.600
You guys are the greatest.      

07:25.600 --> 07:27.400
      Let the party begin.      

07:27.500 --> 07:30.900
The birthday boy is here,       
and I've got the balloons.      

07:30.900 --> 07:32.500
             CARLA:             
 Hey, congratulations, Frasier, 

07:32.600 --> 07:34.100
             on a job well done.

07:34.200 --> 07:35.900
Well, thank you                 
very much.                      

07:38.300 --> 07:41.300
I'll, uh,                       
be right back, Sam.             

07:42.900 --> 07:45.500
    Ah... I love birthdays.     

07:47.600 --> 07:49.000
                        PETE:   
                            Hey.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.200
Isn't that                      
that French guy                 

07:50.300 --> 07:51.500
who's trying to steal           
Woody's girlfriend?             

07:51.600 --> 07:53.600
        Ah, yeah,               
        what a slimebag.        

07:53.700 --> 07:56.100
Yeah, the man's got             
the morals of a snake.          

07:56.100 --> 07:58.200
              I can believe he'd
          show his face in here.

07:58.200 --> 07:59.400
        Hello, fellows.         

07:59.500 --> 08:01.200
 Hey.                           
          Hey, Henri,           
    how're you doing?           

08:03.000 --> 08:04.600
HENRI:                          
Ah, Woody.                      

08:04.600 --> 08:06.300
          Let's hurry           
     and take your picture.     

08:06.300 --> 08:07.500
    I have plans, huh?          

08:07.600 --> 08:08.600
            Oh, yeah, I know.   

08:08.700 --> 08:10.200
            You want to steal   
                  my girlfriend.

08:10.200 --> 08:14.200
No. I could never take          
Kelly away from you.            

08:14.300 --> 08:16.000
Why, just this morning,         
Kelly was telling me            

08:16.000 --> 08:17.900
how much she loves you.         

08:17.900 --> 08:19.500
                    Really?     
  Yes.                          

08:19.600 --> 08:23.300
It got so annoying, I almost had
to kick her out of the shower.  

08:26.000 --> 08:27.500
                 Is that a joke?

08:27.700 --> 08:29.800
Ah! But of course.              

08:29.800 --> 08:31.600
      (laughing)                

08:31.700 --> 08:33.000
    Are you ready?              

08:33.100 --> 08:35.000
          Yeah, I-I just shaved.
             How's my face look?

08:35.100 --> 08:39.299
Mm, as smooth as your girlfriend
        Kelly's bottom.         

08:40.299 --> 08:41.700
                 Is that a joke?

08:41.799 --> 08:44.500
          (laughing):           
      But of course it is.      

08:45.800 --> 08:48.300
 You have to shave much closer. 

08:48.400 --> 08:51.300
        (laughing)              

08:51.400 --> 08:55.700
Where is this, uh, this,        
uh, American sense of humor     

08:55.800 --> 08:57.100
I've heard so much about?       

08:57.100 --> 08:59.900
             Uh, bring me a soda
          and pay for it, Woody.

09:02.600 --> 09:03.800
             Woody,             

09:03.900 --> 09:06.200
you don't even                  
like this man.                  

09:06.200 --> 09:07.300
    He's been bothering you     
        ever since              

09:07.300 --> 09:09.400
  he followed your girlfriend   
        back from Paris.        

09:09.500 --> 09:11.900
And now you're paying him       
    to photograph you?          

09:12.000 --> 09:14.100
        Well, he just borrows   
        money from me anyway.   

09:14.100 --> 09:17.500
  This way I don't have to worry
    about him paying me back.   

09:17.700 --> 09:20.500
      It's good you worked      
        that out, Woody.        

09:22.500 --> 09:24.900
Yeah, besides, this is the first
 formal picture I've had taken  

09:24.900 --> 09:26.300
 since my high school yearbook. 

09:26.400 --> 09:27.500
    I hated that one.           

09:27.500 --> 09:28.600
                 Darned cowlick.

09:28.700 --> 09:30.900
Oh, yeah, when your hair        
all stands up like that?        

09:30.900 --> 09:32.300
                Uh-uh.          

09:37.000 --> 09:37.600
              Sam?              

09:37.700 --> 09:39.300
A thought occurs.               

09:39.300 --> 09:40.300
                            Mmm?

09:40.400 --> 09:42.000
I always have such trouble      
      trying to figure out      

09:42.100 --> 09:44.600
    what to get Frasier         
     for his birthday.          
                         Mm-hmm.

09:44.700 --> 09:47.900
      Do you think perhaps      
 he'd like a photograph of me?  

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
                      Why?      

09:49.100 --> 09:50.300
                    I mean...   

09:51.600 --> 09:52.800
             Of course he would.

09:52.900 --> 09:55.700
      Why would any man not want
          a picture of his wife?

09:55.800 --> 09:56.700
                        I agree.

09:56.700 --> 10:00.600
        A picture of you        
    is what every man wants.    

10:00.700 --> 10:03.800
May I have the honor            
of taking it?                   

10:03.900 --> 10:06.000
            Well, perhaps.      

10:06.100 --> 10:07.800
            But I must warn you.

10:07.900 --> 10:09.700
            I've had bad luck   
             with photographers.

10:09.700 --> 10:11.800
            It seems they always
            overexpose the film,

10:11.900 --> 10:14.100
          and I come out looking
            white as a ghost.   

10:14.100 --> 10:16.600
     Oh.                        

10:16.700 --> 10:19.300
I could put roses               
in your cheeks.                 

10:19.400 --> 10:22.600
And then afterward, maybe       
I could photograph you.         

10:22.700 --> 10:25.500
Why don't you                   
come this way?                  

10:25.500 --> 10:27.900
    Uh, what do you think you   
    would like to be wearing?   

10:28.000 --> 10:30.100
          Uh... an evening gown?

10:30.200 --> 10:32.600
             A black lace teddy?

10:32.600 --> 10:34.600
        My strong male hands?   

10:34.700 --> 10:36.800
 I wasn't thinking of anything  
        like that.              

10:36.900 --> 10:40.000
Oh, come on, Lil,               
loosen up.                      

10:41.400 --> 10:43.300
Let him snap you                
in some lingerie.               

10:43.400 --> 10:45.700
Guys love dirty pictures        
of their babes.                 

10:45.800 --> 10:47.900
Hey, Nick always used           
to take them of me              

10:48.000 --> 10:51.200
until one time I smashed        
his camera and broke his nose.  

10:51.300 --> 10:52.600
  Oh, you got in a fight, huh?  

10:52.600 --> 10:55.400
No, fell off                    
the monkey bars.                

11:02.000 --> 11:04.100
Thank you, Carla.               

11:04.200 --> 11:06.000
Uh, I was thinking more         
of a photograph of me           

11:06.100 --> 11:07.300
he could put                    
in his office.                  
                Mm-hmm.         

11:07.400 --> 11:09.400
A nice formal portrait.         

11:09.500 --> 11:13.100
         Ah, with just a hint of
        smoldering sensuality   

11:13.100 --> 11:14.900
    dancing behind your eyes.   

11:14.900 --> 11:17.800
Well, that goes                 
without saying.                 

11:17.900 --> 11:20.500
    Well, uh, let's just take   
        a few test shots, uh?   

11:20.600 --> 11:23.400
Just to, uh, loosen you up      
before we go back to the studio?

11:23.500 --> 11:25.700
Okay.                           

11:25.800 --> 11:28.100
  Hey, I thought you were here  
      to take <i>my</i> picture.       

11:28.200 --> 11:30.300
And I thought I ordered a soda. 

11:30.300 --> 11:32.700
     You got a point there.     

11:34.000 --> 11:35.700
Okay, okay.                     

11:35.800 --> 11:38.600
Good. Serious.                  

11:38.600 --> 11:40.900
    Happy. Seductive.           

11:41.000 --> 11:43.100
        Angry. Playful.         

11:45.100 --> 11:47.100
     Have you ever modeled      
        professionally?         

11:48.000 --> 11:49.800
          Goodness no.          

11:49.900 --> 11:52.900
    Oh, I know you're lying.    

11:53.000 --> 11:54.600
      Come, let's go back       
         to the studio.         

11:54.600 --> 11:56.200
                      <i>Tres bien.</i>

11:56.300 --> 11:57.900
      <i>Como?</i>                     

11:58.000 --> 12:00.100
        You said, "Let's go back
                 to the studio,"

12:00.200 --> 12:01.700
        and I said, <i>"Tres bien."</i>

12:01.800 --> 12:04.600
No, I'm sorry,                  
I don't understand this.        

12:04.600 --> 12:05.700
                      <i>Tres bien.</i>

12:05.800 --> 12:08.500
Ah, oh, <i>"Tres bien"!</i>            

12:09.800 --> 12:11.700
                 I see I'm going
            to have to teach you

12:11.700 --> 12:13.200
              the French tongue.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.900
 Hey, Henri, I have your soda.  

12:20.900 --> 12:23.000
             Henri?             

12:23.100 --> 12:24.300
Woody, he left.                 

12:25.900 --> 12:28.000
        Well, all right,        
 then I'll just drink his soda. 

12:30.300 --> 12:31.300
      No, I can't do that.      

12:31.400 --> 12:33.500
      That would be wrong.      

12:34.800 --> 12:36.600
        Hi, guys.               

12:36.700 --> 12:38.500
            Rebecca!            

12:38.700 --> 12:39.800
    How did it go with Vera?    

12:39.800 --> 12:41.200
         It went great.         
        I just love her.        

12:41.200 --> 12:42.300
        And guess what?         

12:42.400 --> 12:44.400
      I think I landed her      
    a pretty good job.          

12:44.500 --> 12:46.500
            You're joking.      
No, no,                         
I still have the touch.         

12:46.600 --> 12:48.200
 I helped her with her resume.  
        Where is she working?   

12:48.400 --> 12:50.100
     Then I got her prepped     
    for the interview.          
            Where's she working?

12:50.200 --> 12:51.800
    I even loaned her           
        my lucky scarf.         

12:51.900 --> 12:53.600
                 Yeah, but where
                 is she working?

12:53.700 --> 12:55.600
             VERA:              
             Norm!              

12:55.600 --> 12:57.600
                     Vera!      

13:00.500 --> 13:02.600
                    What are you
                 doing up there?

13:02.700 --> 13:04.300
             VERA:              
    Check your hat, Mister?     

13:05.200 --> 13:08.100
          (screaming)           

13:14.900 --> 13:17.400
 I'll, uh, I'll be right back.  

13:25.700 --> 13:27.300
    Hey, Norm, we need you.     

13:27.400 --> 13:29.000
Pete just hit a bull's-eye      
        and doubled off.        

13:29.100 --> 13:31.500
     You're our last hope.      

13:31.600 --> 13:33.500
             Norm?              

13:34.600 --> 13:36.500
     Norm?                      

13:39.400 --> 13:41.400
                 She's up there.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.200
        What?                   

13:45.300 --> 13:46.900
                Listen.         

13:46.900 --> 13:48.900
     (steps thudding above)     
                  You hear that?

13:49.000 --> 13:50.600
      Hear what?                

13:50.600 --> 13:53.200
                    Vera.       

13:53.300 --> 13:55.700
             She's crossing over
          to the coffee machine.

13:57.500 --> 14:00.200
            No, wait, they could
            be moving the piano.

14:02.600 --> 14:05.500
            Nah, it's her.      

14:05.600 --> 14:08.500
         Come on, man.          
            I know that walk.   

14:08.600 --> 14:10.900
    You can't hear her          
     all the way up there.      

14:10.900 --> 14:12.900
              I wish I couldn't,
                Sam, believe me,

14:12.900 --> 14:15.800
                but that walk is
        burned into my brain.   

14:15.900 --> 14:17.200
                I've heard it   
                  in snow boots.

14:17.200 --> 14:18.300
    I've heard it in flip-flops.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.600
                I've heard it   
                in bare feet.   

14:19.700 --> 14:21.100
    Click-click, click-click,   
                    click-click.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.700
Let the birthday fun begin, Sam!

14:28.800 --> 14:30.600
    The balloons have           
     entered the building.      

14:32.100 --> 14:33.500
    Say, where are the guys?    

14:33.500 --> 14:34.900
They're in the poolroom.        

14:34.900 --> 14:36.300
     Oh, jeez, I'm missing      
          all the fun           

14:36.300 --> 14:37.300
at my own birthday party.       

14:37.400 --> 14:39.200
    Hey, wait up guys!          

14:39.200 --> 14:40.400
                 Hey, be careful
                     back there.

14:40.500 --> 14:41.700
    The dart tournament started.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.700
    (balloons popping)          

14:53.600 --> 14:55.400
        I hate this bar.        

14:58.800 --> 15:01.800
    Norm, Vera's doing          

15:01.800 --> 15:03.200
  a really good job up there.   

15:03.300 --> 15:05.300
     She is just terrific!      

15:05.400 --> 15:07.500
And funny!                      
Listen to this.                 

15:07.600 --> 15:10.500
 How many fat guys does it take 
     to change a lightbulb?     

15:10.500 --> 15:11.800
                I don't know.   

15:11.900 --> 15:14.600
    You can't get a fat guy     
     to change a lightbulb.     

15:15.900 --> 15:17.300
     You can't even get him     
          to come home          

15:17.400 --> 15:19.900
    on Christmas Eve.           

15:20.000 --> 15:22.800
(laughing hysterically)         

15:26.100 --> 15:28.700
Oh, she was telling             
some real cute stories          

15:28.700 --> 15:30.700
about you, too, Norm.           

15:30.800 --> 15:31.900
Hey, why didn't you ever tell us

15:32.000 --> 15:33.500
that your real first name       
          was Hilary?           

15:33.500 --> 15:36.500
    Oh, who cares about that?   

15:36.500 --> 15:37.500
        Hey, guys!              

15:37.600 --> 15:39.400
     Norm's real first name     
        is Hilary!              

15:39.500 --> 15:42.400
                      (laughing)
      Hey, wait a minute.       

15:42.400 --> 15:44.200
Isn't that a girl's name?       

15:45.400 --> 15:47.700
                Hilary was my   
              grandfather's name

15:47.800 --> 15:50.000
    and he once killed a man    
      who laughed at him.       

15:50.000 --> 15:52.100
        What, he just up        
      and killed somebody       

15:52.100 --> 15:53.200
for laughing at his name?       

15:53.200 --> 15:55.800
                    Not exactly.
            He was a surgeon.   

15:55.800 --> 15:57.800
He sort of botched an operation.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.600
Norm, you don't have            
to be defensive.                

16:01.600 --> 16:03.300
I think Hilary's a very         
masculine name.                 

16:03.300 --> 16:04.900
In fact,                        

16:05.000 --> 16:07.500
I think you ought to have it    
monogrammed on your purse.      

16:14.100 --> 16:16.000
      Let the party begin!      

16:16.100 --> 16:16.800
All right!                      

16:16.900 --> 16:18.100
You got the balloons, huh?      

16:18.200 --> 16:18.900
      Well, actually, no.       

16:19.100 --> 16:20.200
They were out of balloons.      

16:20.300 --> 16:22.200
    Fortunately, a colleague    
    of mine was kind enough     

16:22.300 --> 16:25.600
        to give me a box        
      of surgical gloves.       

16:28.700 --> 16:31.000
        If you can't have a good
            time with four dozen

16:31.000 --> 16:33.600
     rubber inflated hands,     
    you're just not trying.     

16:36.000 --> 16:39.400
              Frasier, I've been
                waiting for you.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.100
     Happy Birthday.            

16:42.100 --> 16:43.200
          Well, darling, for me?

16:43.300 --> 16:44.600
Now, Frasier,                   

16:44.700 --> 16:46.300
you know that in the past       

16:46.300 --> 16:48.000
some of my birthday             
presents to you                 

16:48.000 --> 16:49.400
have been a little dull.        

16:49.400 --> 16:51.800
So, this year, I decided        
to try something                

16:51.900 --> 16:53.100
a little more adventurous.      

16:53.200 --> 16:55.400
I thought to myself,            

16:55.500 --> 16:56.900
"What would my husband think    

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
of a provocative photograph     
of his demure wife              

17:00.100 --> 17:03.800
stretched out languidly         
on a bearskin rug?"             

17:03.800 --> 17:05.000
              ALL:              
        Whoo-hoo!               

17:05.099 --> 17:06.700
                  Lilith, surely
                  you're joking.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.099
    I am not.                   

17:10.599 --> 17:13.300
 (bar patrons whistle and howl) 

17:13.400 --> 17:14.900
                Whoo!           

17:18.700 --> 17:20.400
             Well, you're right.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.500
            That certainly is   
                 a bearskin rug.

17:24.900 --> 17:27.700
     And that is definitely you.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.500
                 Oh, how erotic.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.600
              I guess we'll have
          to keep the negatives.

17:31.600 --> 17:33.500
          We'd hate to have them
          falling into the hands

17:33.500 --> 17:35.000
                of <i>Fully Dressed</i>
             <i>Woman's Monthly.</i>   

17:38.000 --> 17:40.100
Frasier, you're forgetting      
what a cheeky monkey I can be.  

17:40.100 --> 17:41.800
It's a gag gift.                

17:41.800 --> 17:43.200
If you wanted us to gag,        

17:43.300 --> 17:44.600
you should have                 
taken a nudie.                  

17:47.900 --> 17:49.200
    Well, you're right, darling.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.300
             And it's hilarious.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.500
        I'll be sure to put this
        right up in my workshop.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.800
You don't have a workshop.      

17:54.800 --> 17:57.000
                Then I'll put it
                  in the closet.

17:58.900 --> 18:01.500
By the way...                   

18:01.600 --> 18:03.000
here are the rest               
of the photographs              

18:03.100 --> 18:04.500
from the session.               

18:04.500 --> 18:05.800
    Why, Lilith, these are...   

18:07.200 --> 18:10.400
      You, you're practically...

18:10.500 --> 18:12.400
        You're only wearing a...

18:13.700 --> 18:15.600
              Oh, baby, baby!   

18:19.500 --> 18:22.600
Happy birthday, Frasier.        

18:22.700 --> 18:24.600
Would you like to go home       
     and get a better look      

18:24.700 --> 18:26.200
    at those?                   
                I sure would.   

18:32.200 --> 18:34.700
      Oh, uh, you can come, too.

18:39.700 --> 18:41.300
                Well, that's it.

18:41.400 --> 18:42.700
                I'm out of here.

18:42.800 --> 18:43.900
      "Out of here"?            

18:44.000 --> 18:46.400
Norm, it's 9:30.                
It's not closing time.          

18:46.500 --> 18:47.800
                        NORM:   
                         I know.

18:47.900 --> 18:49.400
    I'm still leaving.          

18:49.500 --> 18:52.100
Oh, well, I'll drive you,       
          then, okay?           

18:52.100 --> 18:53.400
            No-no-no, I don't   
                    need a ride.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.100
                I didn't even   
                 have any beers.

18:57.600 --> 18:59.500
  I hope you're happy, woman.   

19:01.000 --> 19:03.500
    Look, guys, uh...           

19:03.600 --> 19:06.300
          I can't keep          
      hanging around here.      

19:06.400 --> 19:09.700
      Knowing that <i>she's</i>        
        up there just...        

19:09.800 --> 19:12.000
 spoils the whole thing for me. 

19:12.100 --> 19:14.300
    I'll have to find           
     another bar, I guess.      

19:14.300 --> 19:16.000
     I don't believe this!      

19:16.100 --> 19:18.000
      You're just gonna up      
     and walk out of here?      

19:19.500 --> 19:21.800
Oh, I'm gonna say something that

19:21.900 --> 19:23.800
I thought I'd never say, but... 

19:23.900 --> 19:25.200
    dibs on the first stool!    

19:29.600 --> 19:30.600
         Hey, come on!          

19:30.700 --> 19:32.700
Listen, Cheers wouldn't be      
      Cheers without you.       

19:32.700 --> 19:34.400
            You're the reason   
        why people come here.   

19:34.500 --> 19:35.800
        Oh, what people?        

19:35.900 --> 19:40.000
              Well, the delivery
                man, for one.   

19:42.800 --> 19:44.500
         (Norm screams)         

19:46.500 --> 19:47.700
        She's up there.         

19:47.800 --> 19:49.700
    She's everywhere.           

19:49.800 --> 19:51.400
    Is she like multiplying?    

19:58.400 --> 20:00.300
             Vera?              
(Vera crying)                   

20:00.400 --> 20:01.500
         Are you okay?          

20:01.500 --> 20:03.500
Norm...                         

20:10.000 --> 20:12.600
  Rebecca, have I thanked you   

20:12.600 --> 20:14.300
         for sending me         
     the new hatcheck girl?     

20:14.400 --> 20:16.100
     No, John, you haven't.     

20:16.200 --> 20:17.300
    Well, here's why.           

20:17.400 --> 20:18.600
She was worse                   

20:18.600 --> 20:20.700
    than the last one           
        and I fired her.        

20:20.800 --> 20:23.900
  Hey, do you want to tell me   
      why you fired Vera?       

20:23.900 --> 20:26.000
                    Who are you?
     I'm her husband, Norm.     

20:26.000 --> 20:27.600
                Oh, yes.        

20:27.600 --> 20:29.400
              I didn't recognize
            you without a bar   

20:29.400 --> 20:30.700
      growing out of your chest.

20:34.500 --> 20:35.900
            Well, I fired her   
              because she wasn't

20:36.000 --> 20:37.200
                paying attention
                    to her work.

20:37.300 --> 20:38.200
  What are you talking about?   

20:38.300 --> 20:40.000
          She's a very          
     conscientious worker.      

20:40.000 --> 20:42.300
  How would you describe a woman
         who spends all her time

20:42.400 --> 20:45.100
  on her hands and knees looking
through a knothole in the floor?

20:45.200 --> 20:47.300
        I knew it!              

20:49.300 --> 20:50.600
            Yep, there it is!   

20:50.600 --> 20:52.200
There it is!                    

20:52.300 --> 20:54.200
My good man,                    
you have my sympathy.           

20:54.300 --> 20:57.000
To be married to her            
must be quite an ordeal.        

20:57.100 --> 20:59.700
            Hey, take that back!

20:59.800 --> 21:01.700
    What?                       
                 Take that back!

21:01.800 --> 21:03.300
            You're talking about
            the woman I love!   

21:03.400 --> 21:05.200
         I want you to take that
          back before I turn you

21:05.200 --> 21:06.600
                 into a pretzel!

21:06.700 --> 21:10.600
Well, that's a shape            
I'm sure you're familiar with.  

21:10.700 --> 21:12.400
            I am not kidding!   

21:12.500 --> 21:13.800
All right, all right.           

21:13.800 --> 21:15.800
I take it back. I apologize.    

21:15.900 --> 21:18.100
                All right.      

21:18.100 --> 21:20.200
    Now just go on back upstairs

21:20.200 --> 21:22.700
              before I pound you
        into a... a beer nut!   

21:22.800 --> 21:25.100
Well, thank you.                
I'm tiring of the theme.        

21:29.600 --> 21:32.600
                Wow! Norm,      
                that was sweet. 

21:32.700 --> 21:34.900
     You stood up for your wife.
Shh, shh, shh.                  

21:34.900 --> 21:36.900
                     No, no, no,
        don't be embarrassed.   

21:36.900 --> 21:40.100
Everyone didn't see that,       
        did they?               

21:40.200 --> 21:41.700
                      We saw it.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.400
    I took a picture.           

21:44.600 --> 21:47.300
      Norm, so what if they did?

21:49.300 --> 21:50.500
         You're right.          

21:52.200 --> 21:53.900
Listen, I joke around           
a lot, but...                   

21:54.000 --> 21:56.600
      she's all I've got.       

21:56.600 --> 21:58.400
    I don't know what I'd do    
          without her.          

22:01.300 --> 22:03.200
          I love her.           

22:03.300 --> 22:06.000
                That's sweet.   

22:07.500 --> 22:09.200
                You know, she's,

22:09.300 --> 22:11.800
        she's still up in the   
            stairwell crying.   

22:11.900 --> 22:14.500
 Oh, I know. She'll, she'll go  
      away after a while.       

22:21.500 --> 22:23.700
Yeah, there she goes.           

22:23.800 --> 22:25.500
    You gotta love her!
