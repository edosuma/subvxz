00:04.117 --> 00:05.272
You're doing good there, bud.

00:06.072 --> 00:08.172
Driving like a real pro.

00:09.072 --> 00:11.572
You may wanna show down here just a touch.

00:12.172 --> 00:15.372
We're gonna die, we're gonna die, we're gonna die.

00:15.772 --> 00:17.672
No problem Daddy, you're the boss.

00:18.272 --> 00:20.872
I know what i'm doing old man.
Stick a sock in it.

00:22.972 --> 00:24.972
You're gonna ace that driver's test.

00:25.972 --> 00:28.472
Just focus on the road and stay calm.

00:28.972 --> 00:31.172
I'm gonna throw up!

00:32.372 --> 00:36.872
I will daddy, don't you worry.
That driver's licence is practically already in my hand.

00:37.372 --> 00:41.772
And then I'll nerver have to drive with 
your parental paranoid boy again.

00:52.372 --> 00:54.172
Seatbell, check.

00:55.272 --> 00:56.972
Side view mirror check.

00:58.072 --> 01:01.072
Guy in side view mirror ... 
check him out.

01:06.772 --> 01:09.972
Is it too much to ask people to clean up after their dog?

01:10.372 --> 01:12.172
Is that part of the test, 'cause
 it was not in the manual.

01:12.572 --> 01:15.572
I mean look at this.

01:16.272 --> 01:17.305
Ew... Ew... I'll have to.

01:17.123 --> 01:20.173
You know may be you  could wipe
that off outside my brand new...

01:20.372 --> 01:21.572
car, too late.

01:22.072 --> 01:25.372
Let's get going. 
We're overbooked and I'm all backed up.

01:26.772 --> 01:28.472
Wish I could say the same for the dog!

01:34.372 --> 01:36.772
Both hands on the wheel please.

01:43.372 --> 01:45.072
Head inside the car please.

01:45.472 --> 01:47.572
and close the window, I'm fighting a cold.

01:48.672 --> 01:50.072
But the smell?

01:50.472 --> 01:52.372
It doesn't bother me, thanks for asking.

01:59.672 --> 02:02.772
Look at that, It's already yellow.

02:07.072 --> 02:08.472
OK, that's it.

02:08.771 --> 02:11.172
Get out of my car!

02:11.472 --> 02:13.972
Take your snotty nose and 
your stinky toes with you!

02:18.572 --> 02:22.372
On the bright sight, I used my 
blinker before I pulled over.

03:26.272 --> 03:29.172
But it's not end in the world.
They'll let you take the test again in two weeks.

03:30.272 --> 03:32.372
I know, but it's so not fair!

03:32.772 --> 03:36.172
The only good thing is you're the only one
that I actually told I was doing the test.

03:36.954 --> 03:38.600
Aha ...

03:40.273 --> 03:41.873
What did you do?

03:41.772 --> 03:42.872
well....

03:44.372 --> 03:46.472
<i>Here comes Miley Stewart
she passed her driver test.</i>

03:47.872 --> 03:49.472
<i>She's kicking it behind the wheel
not walking like the rest.</i>

03:50.372 --> 03:52.572
<i>- She can drive it home
- Say what, say what</i>

03:53.672 --> 03:55.672
<i>- I said, she can drive it home
- Say what, say what</i>

03:57.203 --> 04:00.672
<i>Word and respect. Your road.</i>

04:04.225 --> 04:06.572
I may have mentioned it to Oliver.

04:08.246 --> 04:11.072
So, first kid in our class to hit the highway, 
tell us all about it!

04:16.272 --> 04:17.272
Well... I... you know....

04:19.971 --> 04:24.372
Driving I personally think is overrated ...

04:24.772 --> 04:27.272
And It hurts our planet ...

04:27.872 --> 04:29.972
And not driving now that takes some courage!

04:30.981 --> 04:32.572
I don't think I'm gonna drive today or tomorrow

04:34.318 --> 04:36.072
That's how strongly I feel!

04:38.172 --> 04:44.072
You know that is just about the
stupidest thing that I've ever heard.

04:44.472 --> 04:48.172
Ok! Listen up, I'm only gonna say this once
-The truth about it is ...

04:48.947 --> 04:50.272
Hey, Has anybody seen Amsber?

04:51.072 --> 04:56.972
Oh wait! There she is driving her brand
new car with her brand new license.

04:58.115 --> 05:04.627
Look! Look, It's canary yellow 
with matching leather seat....

05:01.322 --> 05:05.628
Which is tacky ... really really tacky.

05:04.662 --> 05:06.272
Yes, Yes, I know what you are thinking.
Isn't she fabulous!

05:08.672 --> 05:10.172
- Raise your hand if you wish you're me.

05:10.472 --> 05:12.072
I do ... I do.

05:13.472 --> 05:15.472
That's it? Only one hand.

05:19.872 --> 05:22.872
You know what? You're all just jelous,
because I got my license before you guys

05:23.728 --> 05:24.272
Yep, First in the class.

05:25.052 --> 05:26.355
Oh no, You're not...

05:26.356 --> 05:28.212
Oh boy! walk.

05:27.647 --> 05:29.972
Don't you ... go ahead, Miley. 
Why don't you tell her?

05:31.972 --> 05:33.072
Ha... ha... funny story.

05:35.572 --> 05:36.972
Help me!

05:37.772 --> 05:38.872
I'm waiting!

05:39.272 --> 05:40.572
she's not to answer you!

05:40.872 --> 05:42.672
Yeah! I don't. 
You're wanna know why?

05:43.872 --> 05:45.172
Bring it on, baby!

05:45.872 --> 05:47.672
Because this is American, that's why!

05:48.172 --> 05:48.772
Yeah!

05:49.272 --> 05:50.772
And in this country people have rights.

05:51.072 --> 05:53.672
And another something called freedom of speech...

05:54.672 --> 05:57.272
or not to speech!

05:58.872 --> 06:00.172
Yeah, She failed, didn't she?

06:00.472 --> 06:02.072
Back to you, baby.

06:03.772 --> 06:06.272
No, I did not fail.

06:06.972 --> 06:11.372
Oh... well, Then I guess that you'll be
driving to the big North Beach party tonight.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.872
Ofcouse that ... that's tonight?

06:14.372 --> 06:15.872
Is there a problem?

06:15.972 --> 06:18.272
- No

06:18.273 --> 06:19.273
<i>- Yes</i>

06:18.872 --> 06:19.972
<i>Oh boy!</i>

06:21.072 --> 06:24.372
<i>I wonder if she like my rap?</i>

06:31.472 --> 06:35.972
Daddy! I have got to drive to that party tonight!

06:36.372 --> 06:38.872
You have to convince them to let me retest the test.

06:39.272 --> 06:42.972
You know, use that: "Well hello darling",
Oh chuck, southern thing of yours.

06:45.172 --> 06:49.272
You know, like you do when you want the lady
at the grocery store use your expired coupons.

06:50.272 --> 06:53.672
Hey Miles, Do you really think if I
could convince DMV at anything

06:53.972 --> 06:56.872
I'd still have this for driver's license photo?

07:00.572 --> 07:02.972
Yeah, I was in the middle of sneeze, 
when they took the picture,

07:03.272 --> 07:06.172
now everytime I show my ID, I gotta go ...

07:07.172 --> 07:09.872
Well, at least ... can drive!

07:10.572 --> 07:14.072
Honney, I know you're dispointed, 
but you can retake the test in the couple weeks.

07:14.572 --> 07:17.372
And until then your borhter can drive you around.

07:17.872 --> 07:21.572
No, no, no, no, no ....

07:21.972 --> 07:24.772
Why, why, why, why, ....

07:36.891 --> 07:39.173
Oh, come on baby, rules are rules.

07:38.672 --> 07:39.872
You're just gonna have to wait.

07:40.820 --> 07:41.172
You're right.

07:41.972 --> 07:48.572
There is nothing else that I can do.

07:50.572 --> 07:52.972

07:54.272 --> 07:59.772
Hey Lily, meet me at the bus stop.
This girl is getting her license.

08:01.172 --> 08:04.972
Hey dad, there look at this.
I just find the picture of me when I was six months old.

08:06.072 --> 08:10.272
Sweet, cuddly and so so happy...

08:11.272 --> 08:15.072
and then you ruined it by having that little devil child..

08:15.772 --> 08:18.372
You gotto learn to laugh at life's little difficulties.

08:20.272 --> 08:22.472
And speaking of little difficulties,

08:22.872 --> 08:24.372
We have a houseguest.

08:25.572 --> 08:27.672

Look son, he's folks are nice people. beside ...

08:47.291 --> 08:50.741
helping out a neighbor is what life's about

08:50.776 --> 08:51.772
Ok, old man, what did they give you?

08:52.472 --> 08:53.772
Laker tickets, court side.

08:56.672 --> 08:59.172
feels so good on the open soars

09:00.772 --> 09:03.272
May be I should head out for VIP parking.

09:08.872 --> 09:11.572
You really think that they're gonna let
you retake the test on the same day?

09:12.780 --> 09:12.972
They have to!

09:13.842 --> 09:16.972
If I don't drive myself to that beach party tonight.
My life will be miserable.

09:17.972 --> 09:20.472
What are you talking about?
You're ... Hannah Montana.

09:21.232 --> 09:22.554
Nah, That doesn't count.

09:22.589 --> 09:26.472
Ok, I'm just going to tell the lady what happened.
Look at that sweet face.

09:28.822 --> 09:30.272
She would definitely make an exception.

09:30.772 --> 09:31.872
No!

09:33.172 --> 09:35.372
Rules are rules, Bargo!

09:36.478 --> 09:37.672
I'm the governor of California.

09:39.289 --> 09:41.172
And I'm the Qeen of this window.

09:41.972 --> 09:45.372

09:46.627 --> 09:47.772
Your appointment has been terminated.

09:49.308 --> 09:50.848

09:51.073 --> 09:52.573

09:54.970 --> 09:56.072
Not for the next two weeks, you won't. Next!

09:58.701 --> 10:00.760
I'm so dead!

10:05.972 --> 10:09.572
Yeah, Honey, Please, the hannah concert is sold out.

10:10.172 --> 10:13.272
If mommy could get you better 
seats you know that she would.

10:15.090 --> 10:17.857
And Hannah is very much alive!

10:20.108 --> 10:24.372
Uhm ha? Next.

10:30.056 --> 10:32.572
- Hello
- Oh my god, It's Hannah Montana!

10:34.872 --> 10:37.472
Today I'm not an international pop sensation.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.472
I'm just another citizen here to take my driver test.

10:42.049 --> 10:45.679
How refreshing is that? Standing in the line, 
waiting her turn, she's just a regular ....

10:45.514 --> 10:46.053
Why are you talking?

10:46.263 --> 10:46.672
I don't know

10:50.305 --> 10:51.072
Oh, no

10:51.972 --> 10:53.872
I must have left my paperwork at home and

10:54.172 --> 10:58.172
grabbed these complimentary
backstage passes by mistake.

10:58.572 --> 11:00.372
Whatever will I do now?

11:01.572 --> 11:04.672
Oh, you don't worry. 
You talented little Hannah about that.

11:05.372 --> 11:07.372
- I'll be just a minute
- Sure

11:10.372 --> 11:11.972
Wait a minute, Let's say you do get the license.

11:13.408 --> 11:15.272
How are you going to drive to that party 
without your dad noticing your car's missing?

11:15.972 --> 11:20.172
Simple. Every Friday night Daddy goes to the gym,
runs on the treadmil for 10 minutes

11:21.072 --> 11:27.079
and then spends the rest of the night
rewarding himself at Busko's House of Chicken Pie.

11:27.772 --> 11:29.961
He should be leaving right about now.

11:35.372 --> 11:41.454
hey, please, don't leave me alone with ... that.

11:42.072 --> 11:44.851
I've got a big swim meet this weeken.

11:44.886 --> 11:47.914
You wouldn't beleive the difference it makes in the butterfly.

11:53.484 --> 11:56.172
- Sorry son, every man for himself
- No!

12:01.358 --> 12:04.799
<i> sometimes I lie to the goverment just</i>

12:04.834 --> 12:08.268
<i>to get my license to drive a car.</i>

12:08.303 --> 12:12.142
<i>And now I'm on the way to the party</i>

12:12.138 --> 12:16.558
<i>to see Amsber and scrubs her face in ah na ... ah </i>

12:20.796 --> 12:22.196
Not good!

12:37.772 --> 12:40.042

12:40.072 --> 12:42.401

12:43.355 --> 12:46.188
Your turn the signal's been on
for the last mile and a half. .

12:46.972 --> 12:51.372
Oh, my face's red. 
You're very good in your job.

12:52.979 --> 12:54.386
They should make you captain.

12:54.572 --> 12:56.602
I'll write a letter, thanks so much for your help.

12:56.097 --> 12:57.982
It's been great work with you. bye bye.

12:57.717 --> 12:59.447
No, not so fast miss!

12:59.482 --> 13:05.072
First, explain to me why your 
license says "Hannah Montana"?

13:05.972 --> 13:10.272
Oh, that's just because ... 
sweet niblets!

13:15.100 --> 13:18.700
No! Please! I just changed my name to Hannah Monata,

13:19.027 --> 13:20.700
'cause I'm a really big fan.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.200
You know, it would happen to you too,
if you were famous. I mean

13:23.500 --> 13:26.000
Los Angelus would be flooded with Diaria's.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.100
It's Diaria.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.300
I knew that! And I'm really sorry!

13:32.700 --> 13:34.300
You just got to beleive me, that I...

13:36.800 --> 13:37.900
or not.

13:38.300 --> 13:41.100
Maybe sometime in here, 
help you remember the truth.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.800
I can't stay in here!

13:46.500 --> 13:48.500
I... I... I... gotta potty.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.200
Right there.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.100
Not this lifetime!

13:56.700 --> 13:59.600
Please, just call my daddy cell phone,
 he'll clear all up for me.

13:59.900 --> 14:01.000
I'll be grounded for like three years,

14:01.400 --> 14:05.200
At least I'll have a bathroom with a door
and the cursy toilet seat that says
come on over and show this about

14:07.300 --> 14:09.400
What's the number?

14:14.800 --> 14:18.800
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't know when I invited
you over then I would get stuck ...

14:23.600 --> 14:25.900
babysitting.

14:29.300 --> 14:32.300
I think that's last week's lamb chop!

14:34.900 --> 14:38.200
I'm sorry, You're just not worth it.

14:38.500 --> 14:42.200
Wait, no! I made clam dip!

14:51.000 --> 14:52.200
Heyo!

14:52.800 --> 14:55.900
Hello, This is officer Diaria, down at Malibu PD.

14:56.200 --> 15:00.700
Have a girl here, says she's your daughter
 and claims to be Hannah Montana

15:01.500 --> 15:03.000
What?

15:03.400 --> 15:05.200
Is Hannah Montana your daughter?

15:05.700 --> 15:10.500
Yes, ofcourse. 
She lives with me and my wife Shikera!

15:11.100 --> 15:15.600
Now, prank somebody else. 
You're killing Rico's beauty buzz

15:17.301 --> 15:21.300
Ok, You have jerked me around 
for two years and I'm sick of it.

15:23.300 --> 15:28.600
Whatever friendship we had is over.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.300
What did he say?

15:35.222 --> 15:38.900
He said I was killing Rico's beauty buzz.

15:39.400 --> 15:42.500
Rico!

15:44.100 --> 15:46.100
You are in a lot of troubles here, miss.

15:46.306 --> 15:51.800
Until I can figure out exactly who you are.
You'll have to kiss your cushion toilet seat good bye.

15:51.961 --> 15:53.700
You've got to beleive me! Come back!

15:54.500 --> 15:55.800
Ok, the truth is...

15:58.300 --> 16:00.100
My real name is Miley Stewart.

15:59.539 --> 16:02.700
I'm just a regular girl, who's secretly pop star, 
but hide it so she can live a normal life.

16:03.100 --> 16:05.400
it's best of both world. Get it? Cute huh?

16:06.800 --> 16:09.300
Where do you kids come up with these ridiculous ideas?

16:09.600 --> 16:11.500
I blame television.

16:11.800 --> 16:16.200
Please, you've gotta beleive me!
I'm Hannah Montana, ask me anything about her.

16:16.300 --> 16:18.800
Alright, If you're gonna stick to this idiot story,

16:18.815 --> 16:21.896
There's only one thing left for me to do.

16:28.900 --> 16:29.900
She's in here.

16:30.900 --> 16:33.100
You know what you have to do.

16:37.700 --> 16:39.400
I'm gonna enjoy this!

16:40.300 --> 16:41.700
Oh yeah!

16:43.600 --> 16:45.200
Who is it?

16:45.500 --> 16:48.500
My daughter. The ultimate Hannah fan.

16:48.800 --> 16:52.100
If you can convince her you're Hannah Montana.
 I'll let you go.

16:52.700 --> 16:53.900
Ofcouse! That willl be easy.

16:54.200 --> 16:55.600
What do you want to know, sweetie?

16:55.900 --> 16:58.900
Don't "sweetie" me, punk!

17:01.400 --> 17:05.490
December 19, 2007 Hannah performed where?

17:05.700 --> 17:06.800
Hartbrough Civic Centre.

17:06.796 --> 17:08.200
- What did she open with?
- Rock Star

17:08.400 --> 17:09.900
- Close with?
- Best of both world

17:09.901 --> 17:10.901
10 minutes ... 

17:12.901 --> 17:14.810
Don't go anywhere this ain't gonna take long

17:14.845 --> 17:18.799
- Oh no, I'm just getting started
- Hannah not-Tana

17:20.800 --> 17:24.194
In between Pump up the Party and I Got Nerve,

17:24.229 --> 17:29.301
Hannah said "I love the you, Connecticut" 
and then winked at the audience.

17:29.300 --> 17:31.219
What eye did she use?

17:32.700 --> 17:35.866
Which eye? Are you kidding me?

17:36.104 --> 17:40.733
- Do I look like I'm kidding? Hu..h

17:42.008 --> 17:45.306
Sweet kid you got there. 
Who's her mother? Godzilla?

17:51.200 --> 17:54.100
Mommy please, you have to come home early.

17:55.300 --> 17:58.200
Jackson doesn't want me here anymore.

17:58.800 --> 18:01.700
No, Mammy, It's my fault.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.891
Why am I such a jerk to the people I care most about?

18:08.631 --> 18:10.868
 Bravo!

18:11.100 --> 18:12.300
- Jackson, What are you doing?

18:12.531 --> 18:15.657
You're right! 
Like that's really mummy on the phone.

18:15.730 --> 18:17.147
She can hear you.

18:17.182 --> 18:18.300
Oh yeah, Well wait till she hear this.

18:19.200 --> 18:21.297
Well hey there pretty mumma.

18:21.506 --> 18:26.786
You wanna come over for a game of hide and seek?
I'll let you find me my sweet little cherio

18:26.821 --> 18:34.291
Oh! Oh no! No, no, I didn't know!
But no ... I had no idea ...

18:35.400 --> 18:36.600
Shame on you!

18:37.000 --> 18:40.927
Just tell her I'm sorry,
and you can stay here as long as you want, ok?

18:41.000 --> 18:42.400
In fact, I'll take the coatch.

18:42.700 --> 18:44.800
I'll even clean my room for you.

18:51.400 --> 18:52.700
Nice work, Mummy.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.757
Together we're unbeatable. 
woa ..ha ..a ..a

19:01.500 --> 19:08.523
November 4, 2006 Hannah,
 jumps on a paparazi's back outside of a Trendy club

19:08.558 --> 19:11.200
What's the head line in Los Angelos Herald?

19:11.266 --> 19:17.200
Ah... I known this... Hannah wild ride! Bam!

19:17.600 --> 19:24.900
March 17, 2005 Sunset boulevar.
 Billboard goes up of Hannah with a zit on her face

19:25.000 --> 19:28.498
- Was it on her cheek or her chin?
- my cheek.

19:29.488 --> 19:30.758
No... my chin.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.800
It had to be my cheek, I always...

19:33.523 --> 19:36.000
It was my cheek! bam bam!

19:36.001 --> 19:40.578
It was her forehead. 
Bang bang, Jerky and ham

19:42.900 --> 19:46.215
We're done here. 
- Listen!

19:45.626 --> 19:51.344
Dont't do the crime,
 if you can do the time. Oh yeah!

19:54.062 --> 19:58.327
<i>You get the limo out front, uh .. ah.. uh</i>

19:59.395 --> 20:02.934
<i>hottest style, every shoe, every color</i>

20:02.935 --> 20:06.831
<i>yeah, when you're famous, it can be kind of fun</i>

20:06.832 --> 20:11.574
<i>It's really you but no one ever discovered</i>

20:11.700 --> 20:13.594
Oh, It really is you.

20:13.629 --> 20:16.374
Alright, Alright. 
I've had enough of that! get off me.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.500
You cannot tell anyone about this, Ok?

20:20.632 --> 20:22.394
Otherwise, I can't be Hannah anymore.

20:22.900 --> 20:24.329
We can't let that happen.

20:24.500 --> 20:28.575
No, we can't. 
Now go tell your daddy to let me out of here.

20:28.610 --> 20:30.748
so I can get home before my dad fights out.

20:32.500 --> 20:35.088
Daddy's little convict say what?

20:40.900 --> 20:44.200
Kids! we do the darnest things

20:44.500 --> 20:48.900
But you gotta love us. 
You gotta love me, right?

20:49.052 --> 20:52.437
You know what! you wanna something so bad 
that you bent the rules to get it.

20:52.500 --> 20:55.116
And anytime you do that it's 
gonna bite you on the butt.

20:57.700 --> 21:01.035
You're right. 
You're absolutely right.

21:01.100 --> 21:04.200
Two hours and 23 minutes in the 
slammer can really change a person.

21:05.200 --> 21:06.300
I learn my lesson.

21:06.500 --> 21:09.200
So any other, you know, punishment
 would be completely pointless.

21:09.286 --> 21:11.800
I wouldn't necessarily go that far with it.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.300
Daddy, please we not go down this road

21:18.800 --> 21:23.600
This is where the party and the last thing 
I want is to be seen being driven by my dad.

21:25.600 --> 21:27.400
Oh no

21:27.900 --> 21:29.300
Oh yes

21:30.700 --> 21:32.100
come on Daddy.

21:32.700 --> 21:35.600
You may as well pull out the blow
 horn and annouce my arrival.

21:36.100 --> 21:38.800
You know me to well darling.

21:39.100 --> 21:40.900
Oh, come on!

21:41.500 --> 21:46.300
Hi everybody, It's Miley stewart's 
Daddy dropping her off at the party

21:46.700 --> 21:50.500
Because she didn't get a license!
 ha ha ha

21:52.000 --> 21:53.900
How's that for punishment?

22:02.600 --> 22:04.400
It is so not fair

22:04.900 --> 22:06.622
Who did the picture on two

22:06.657 --> 22:09.663
Everyone know you do it on three,
 one two three!

22:10.300 --> 22:11.418
It's really not that bad.

22:11.500 --> 22:15.424
Are you kidding? 
It looks like a horse stepped on her face

22:16.300 --> 22:18.000
Oliver, that's ridiculous.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.356
It's more like she ran into a plain glass door! 
ha..ha
