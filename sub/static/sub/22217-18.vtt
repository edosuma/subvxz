Steven, you look so handsome.

00:19.561 --> 00:22.105
-This is Liam, my husband.
-It's Ridley, Liam Ridley.

00:22.647 --> 00:25.483
-I'm engaged, with Sam.
-Cristal's nephew?

-...bequeaths parcel 1-3-2 to Alexis.
-He left her our home!

Where is breakfast?

01:06.691 --> 01:08.693
I was explaining
the former Mrs. Carrington

01:08.777 --> 01:11.321
has invited you to dine in the loft.

01:11.404 --> 01:13.406
Well, not all of you.

01:13.490 --> 01:14.532
Blake and Fallon.

01:14.616 --> 01:15.909
Ever the gracious hostess.

01:16.409 --> 01:19.120
Only way I'm stepping
in that loft again is to burn it down.

01:19.746 --> 01:23.041
Just have Mrs. Gunnerson whip up
something small for the rest of us.

01:23.124 --> 01:27.420
Unfortunately, Alexis has commandeered
the kitchen staff as well.

01:27.504 --> 01:31.382
She's not Grandpa. She can't just waltz
in there and start ordering people around.

01:31.466 --> 01:33.676
Apparently,
she can do whatever she wants here.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.054
Anders, assemble the staff, now.

01:36.137 --> 01:37.138
And what about her?

01:37.222 --> 01:40.099
She's a child playing a child's game.
Best just to ignore her.

01:40.558 --> 01:43.353
Well,
she's not taking my bacon without a fight.

01:46.231 --> 01:47.148
Hmm.

01:47.232 --> 01:49.734
And I thought Bo was the only one
who begged for scraps.

01:49.818 --> 01:53.113
-Well, hello. I was hoping you'd join us.
-Oh, I'm not joining you.

01:53.196 --> 01:56.116
I'm taking back breakfast... and my dog.

01:56.574 --> 01:57.408
Ah.

01:57.492 --> 02:02.163
Well, well, well. Benedict Carrington and
Benedict Jo, of course you both are here.

02:02.455 --> 02:05.250
So, I like eggs Benedict,
you don't have to be nasty about it.

02:05.458 --> 02:08.627
We're just having a meal together, Fallon.
Is that such a crime?

02:08.711 --> 02:10.255
Everything she does is criminal

02:10.338 --> 02:13.341
from her eye shadow
to her patented brand of neglect.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.177
-Blame me for the past if you must.
-Okay.

02:16.261 --> 02:19.764
But please, join us for brunch.
We're celebrating Steven's engagement.

02:20.723 --> 02:22.225
-Engagement?
-Mom.

02:22.308 --> 02:24.269
-She didn't know?
-I was gonna tell you.

02:24.352 --> 02:27.313
-When? On your honeymoon?
-The other day, before you slapped me.

02:27.397 --> 02:28.940
He wanted you to be maid of honor.

02:29.482 --> 02:33.153
We're thinking of a ceremony in Sicily
and then spend the next years traveling.

02:33.236 --> 02:35.697
Steven mentioned that. How fun.

02:36.030 --> 02:38.366
Well,
I won't ruin your little celebration.

02:38.449 --> 02:41.077
I want to celebrate
with the people I love, all of them.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.872
-We're planning a proper engagement party.
-Not with her.

02:43.955 --> 02:46.833
-Where everyone can feel welcome.
-That's a wonderful idea.

02:47.333 --> 02:50.253
-The perfect excuse to get a new outfit.
-With what money?

02:50.336 --> 02:52.297
Sam, you should come with me.

02:52.964 --> 02:56.217
I'll take you to... L. B. Luft Boutique.

02:56.384 --> 02:58.261
Oh, it'll be a great getting-to-know-you.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.638
First you should know,
I look good in everything.

03:00.722 --> 03:04.475
From black tie
to a community theater production of <i>Hair</i>.

03:05.476 --> 03:06.811
Thank you.

Come on, Fallon, what do you say?

03:25.371 --> 03:29.083
and now he wants to pick up like
she just ran to the corner for cigarettes?

03:29.167 --> 03:32.170
-Everyone has a way to deal with trauma.
-By causing more?

03:32.545 --> 03:35.632
She says she's here for us,
but she's here because she's broke

03:35.715 --> 03:37.926
and now she's luring the family back
one by one.

03:38.009 --> 03:40.511
First Steven,
now she's got her sights set on Sammy Jo.

03:40.845 --> 03:43.932
Like the zombie apocalypse.
I'll be the only one with a brain.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.767
Who served you that? I'm starving.

03:46.309 --> 03:47.310
It was in the bowl.

03:52.440 --> 03:56.402
She's out there eating my bacon,
while I am reduced to decorative fruit?

03:56.819 --> 03:59.030
She may have weaseled her way
into that loft,

03:59.113 --> 04:01.741
but she's not making it
into Steven's engagement photos.

04:01.824 --> 04:03.534
We need to get her out of here today.

04:05.787 --> 04:09.582
Thanks for coming. I believe
you all know my wife, Mrs. Carrington.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.961
-What? Of course they do, Blake.
-Then they need reminding.

04:13.044 --> 04:16.172
There's an imposter in the stable house
going by the same name.

04:16.798 --> 04:19.132
You answer to me. And to Cristal.

04:19.216 --> 04:21.302
Not Alexis. Are we clear?

04:23.513 --> 04:25.473
Well, perhaps we need re-introductions.

04:26.849 --> 04:28.685
This is Tony, our gardener...

04:28.768 --> 04:30.895
who cuts as much grass as he smokes.

04:32.146 --> 04:34.232
Jeanette, our best housekeeper...

04:34.857 --> 04:36.526
who can't remember instructions.

04:38.736 --> 04:39.779
Mrs. Gunnerson...

04:41.489 --> 04:45.827
head of the kitchen, whose several
family members eat well at my expense.

04:47.495 --> 04:49.080
However, they all do good work.

04:49.831 --> 04:53.459
And that outweighs
their small deficiencies.

04:54.127 --> 04:57.046
-But they are not indispensable.
-Blake, can we please not do this?

04:57.130 --> 04:59.215
Mrs. Gunnerson,
how long you been with me?

04:59.299 --> 05:00.466
Sixteen years.

05:00.550 --> 05:04.304
Did you have a conversation with
Mrs. Carrington about moving breakfast?

05:04.762 --> 05:07.140
-Yes, sir, Alexis asked--
-Wrong.

05:07.223 --> 05:09.684
You did not have a conversation
with Mrs. Carrington!

05:09.767 --> 05:11.853
You had a conversation with the imposter!

05:12.395 --> 05:15.606
And if I catch any of you
talking to, talking about,

05:15.690 --> 05:19.777
or in any way aiding
that succubus out in the stable house,

05:19.861 --> 05:21.029
you are done here.

05:22.363 --> 05:24.615
And you, Mrs. Gunnerson,
can pack your things.

05:24.699 --> 05:26.451
-Mr. Carrington--
-Back to work.

05:32.206 --> 05:35.710
[sighs] Well, the upside
of having an absentee mother,

05:36.169 --> 05:38.588
her not knowing
I'd have keys to Culhane's place.

05:40.631 --> 05:42.884
So, you and the driver were a couple.

05:42.967 --> 05:45.470
I was trying to figure out
what was going on there.

05:45.553 --> 05:46.721
Well, join the club.

05:46.804 --> 05:49.015
But instead of worrying
about my love life,

05:49.098 --> 05:50.516
why don't you be my lookout?

05:50.767 --> 05:54.270
My mother just moved all of her
priceless trailer trash into this loft,

05:54.353 --> 05:56.272
-so, if she's hiding something--
-Wait.

05:56.898 --> 05:59.484
-You don't know what you're looking for?
-I know my mom.

05:59.567 --> 06:01.986
If she's not slinging mud,
she's rolling around in it,

06:02.070 --> 06:04.072
so, there's got to be some dirt
around here.

06:04.155 --> 06:06.115
She's had people here,
it has to be hidden.

06:06.657 --> 06:09.494
I'd say check behind the paintings,
under window jambs.

06:09.660 --> 06:12.413

if you ask me.

06:14.791 --> 06:17.376
Is this when you say you're on
the FBI's most wanted list?

06:17.460 --> 06:20.296
-Because this family does have a type.
-Not a criminal.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.548
I just like mystery novels.

06:23.299 --> 06:25.802
-And besides, I used to build houses.
-Oh.

06:26.511 --> 06:27.970
I took a crash course on you,

06:28.054 --> 06:31.432
but did it never cross your mind
to ask anything about me?

06:31.516 --> 06:32.809
Don't take it personally.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.104
-How would you know if I did?
-Okay.

06:37.438 --> 06:39.398
So, how did you end up building houses?

06:39.816 --> 06:42.777
I, uh, went to Japan to volunteer
after the tsunami.

06:42.860 --> 06:46.405
Hmm. My dad always joked
that I would marry a Democrat.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.450

he'd be a socialist, too.

Have you called the other part yet?

11:37.905 --> 11:41.325
-I know she's worried about you.
-Please, do not tell her.

11:41.867 --> 11:42.993
Right now, I just...

11:44.245 --> 11:45.746
I just really need some space.

11:45.830 --> 11:49.125
Well, to be honest, I came here
to try to convince you to come back,

11:49.667 --> 11:52.420
but obviously
what is happening here is important.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.338
Michael, who's this?

11:54.922 --> 11:58.134
Oh, this is, um, Mrs. Carrington.

11:58.217 --> 12:01.137
[Cristal] I came to make sure you and
your family have everything you need.

12:01.762 --> 12:03.431
Michael means so much to us.

12:03.889 --> 12:06.600
Truly, he's more than a chauffeur,
he's family.

12:06.684 --> 12:09.812
Chauffeur? You must have him confused
with someone else.

12:10.229 --> 12:13.399
Michael's a vice president
at Carrington Atlantic.

12:17.778 --> 12:19.738
You lied to your father and me?

12:21.574 --> 12:22.825
Ma, I can explain.

12:23.492 --> 12:25.536
Why would you do that, Michael?

12:33.961 --> 12:36.172
I am so sorry, I had no idea.

12:37.047 --> 12:38.215
I tried to warn you. What are you doing here?

12:44.972 --> 12:48.142
I came to pay for whatever
you picked since she can't afford it.

12:48.225 --> 12:51.687
And I wouldn't want my dear brother's
fiancé to walk off empty-handed.

12:51.770 --> 12:54.815
Don't be ridiculous.
I always have special occasion cash.

12:55.191 --> 12:58.319
And what's that?
Two-for-one coupons at the Dollar Store? Wow, I thought you said
your personal space was non-negotiable.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.992
I'm waiting to see
if her card gets declined.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.703
-No such luck.
-[clerk] Just a signature.

13:08.621 --> 13:09.622
Thank you, Mommy.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.332
Come on, let's go.

13:16.253 --> 13:17.129
Excuse me.

13:17.963 --> 13:21.383
I have to ask you to show me your bags.
One of our silent alarms went off.

13:22.259 --> 13:24.220
I've often been told I fit the profile.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.058
You're good. Ma'am?

13:30.518 --> 13:31.352
Excuse me?

13:42.905 --> 13:46.700
-Oh, old habits do die hard.
-I did not take that watch.

13:46.784 --> 13:49.954
-I'm gonna ask you to come with me.
-I have no idea how that got there.

13:50.037 --> 13:51.747
This is unacceptable.

13:51.830 --> 13:55.084
-I am a Carrington.
-Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?

13:56.377 --> 13:58.045
They're going to arrest your mom.

13:58.504 --> 13:59.338
You're welcome.

14:07.179 --> 14:10.516
Now you can afford to buy something pretty
from the vending machine.

14:12.768 --> 14:14.478
Thank God. What a nightmare.

14:15.354 --> 14:18.482
I can't tell you what it means
that you're here for me, Fallon.

14:19.733 --> 14:22.319
Where did she go? You just posted bail.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.196
Oh, that wasn't bail.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.823
Well, then...?

14:27.825 --> 14:28.826
Sam didn't do it.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.370
You put that watch in my bag.

14:31.453 --> 14:33.080
Don't con a con artist, darling.

14:33.372 --> 14:36.834
Now, if you want out of here,
you'll have to agree to my terms.

14:37.376 --> 14:39.378
Terms? [scoffs] What terms?

14:39.461 --> 14:42.548
Simply that you leave. Atlanta. Us.

14:42.631 --> 14:45.634
Don't worry. I'm sure it'll be easier
the second time around.

14:45.718 --> 14:48.220
But I just got back here
and my babies need me.

14:48.304 --> 14:49.471
Especially you, Fallon.

14:49.555 --> 14:52.683
Yes, and I've been enjoying
the mother-daughter bail-bonding time,

14:52.766 --> 14:55.769
but I think we both know
you didn't take Sam shopping just to bond.

14:56.812 --> 14:57.897
Explain this.

14:58.981 --> 15:01.317
You didn't have a problem
at your Brady Brunch.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.861
Steven is sensitive.
I didn't want him to feel judged.

15:03.944 --> 15:07.072
-Nice you're concerned about one of us.
-I care about both of you.

15:07.156 --> 15:10.242
Your goodbye note was a Post-it that said,
"Carbs are for losers."

15:10.326 --> 15:12.912
That bit was motivational
and worked, for the most part.

15:13.662 --> 15:16.749
This bus ticket is non-refundable
and it has your name on it.

15:16.832 --> 15:20.961
If you agree to use it, I'll get you out.
If not, you want to rot here, it's fine.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.212
It's totally up to you.

15:23.714 --> 15:24.548
You made bail.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.053
[Alexis] Thank you, baby.

15:32.806 --> 15:33.849
What?

15:33.933 --> 15:36.352
I'm sorry I told you I was an executive.

15:37.061 --> 15:40.064
But I just didn't want you and Dad
to be disappointed that I was...

15:41.023 --> 15:41.899
only a driver.

15:41.982 --> 15:44.151
You've been hanging
around those people too long

15:44.234 --> 15:47.780
if you think your job has anything to do
with why we're proud.

15:48.280 --> 15:52.117
It would break your father's heart to know
you've forgotten what's important.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.118
[knock on door]

15:55.621 --> 15:58.874
I'm sorry for saying too much earlier
and I want to make it up to you.

15:59.416 --> 16:01.961
-I found a doctor who can help--
-No, you don't have to.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.712
Oh, no, let her finish.

16:03.796 --> 16:06.090
Fair or not, and it's not...

16:06.173 --> 16:08.717
the Carringtons have access
to the best medical care.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.761
Better doctors, better hospitals.

16:10.844 --> 16:13.013
Our family wants to help yours.

16:13.764 --> 16:14.765
Please let us.

16:14.848 --> 16:17.643
Don't know about Michael,
but I say hell yes.

16:18.143 --> 16:20.396
Okay, good.
I was hoping you would say that.

16:20.771 --> 16:23.565
I contacted the head of the hospital.
She was at a conference.

16:23.649 --> 16:27.611
I sent CA's jet for her, and she reviewed
your father's records on the way back.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.030
This is Doctor Kim.

16:31.365 --> 16:32.199
Hello.

16:33.450 --> 16:36.078
I was just speaking to the techs
about your father's tests,

16:36.412 --> 16:39.456
and my hunch is that he has
acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.000
It's more prevalent in children,

16:41.083 --> 16:43.877
but I've seen the numbers rise in adults
the past few years.

16:43.961 --> 16:46.630
-Why is that?
-It's been linked to viral infections,

16:46.714 --> 16:48.007
environmental factors. Regardless of the cause,

16:49.466 --> 16:51.885
we have a clinical trial
that's showing great promise.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.179
I'll make sure
that your father is included.

16:54.263 --> 16:57.808
The one percent is good for some things,
at least one percent of the time.

16:59.393 --> 17:00.310
Thank you for this.

17:01.395 --> 17:02.980
You're part of our family, Michael.

17:03.564 --> 17:04.732
No matter where you work.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.320
Mrs. Gunnerson.

17:13.281 --> 17:14.282
What are you doing?

17:15.617 --> 17:17.243
I told you to pack your suitcase,

17:17.327 --> 17:19.538
so, unless you've been living
out of a tea cart--

17:19.621 --> 17:21.540
-No, sir. I haven't.
-Is that for Alexis?

17:22.124 --> 17:23.459
Did she hire you back?

17:23.541 --> 17:24.417
No, I did.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.170
Thank you.

17:26.795 --> 17:27.628
A word.

17:29.298 --> 17:33.719
Respectfully, sir, Mrs. Gunnerson
has worked for this family for 16 years

17:33.802 --> 17:37.723
-and you love her beef Wellington.
-That's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.

17:38.265 --> 17:41.685
I drew a line. I told them that I would
fire anyone that helped that witch.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.938
Then you'd have to fire me, too, sir.

17:46.732 --> 17:47.816
We need to talk.

17:51.945 --> 17:53.989
You don't just bail Cruella out.
I had a plan.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.657
To let our own mother rot in jail.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.786
That was her plan for your fiancé
until I intervened to save Sam.

17:58.869 --> 18:01.038
Why would I believe anything you say
right now?

18:01.163 --> 18:03.749
Not only did you want to leave her,
you put her there in--

18:03.832 --> 18:05.167
Children, children.

18:06.251 --> 18:07.920
It hurts me to see you two fighting.

18:08.879 --> 18:09.713
I'm fine.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.758
I mean, it was dirty
and morally degrading.

18:12.841 --> 18:14.009
I am famished--

18:14.093 --> 18:17.429
Stop clutching your plastic pearls,
Mother. You did this to yourself.

18:19.223 --> 18:21.934
-What's that?
-[Fallon] I found this in her loft.

18:22.017 --> 18:24.853
She hired a PI to investigate your fiancé.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.106
She's trying to liposuck Sam
out of your life.

18:27.231 --> 18:30.359
I have supported their engagement
since day one.

18:30.442 --> 18:32.277
-Yesterday?
-You, on the other hand,

18:32.361 --> 18:35.155
have tried to ruin Cristal
and her family since the beginning.

18:35.447 --> 18:36.365
Steven told me.

18:37.491 --> 18:41.495
We know what you're doing, Fallon, but
the fact that you'd go to such lengths...

18:44.248 --> 18:46.166
Wait, this is your research on Sam?

18:47.459 --> 18:48.460
What? No.

18:48.544 --> 18:51.296
Trying to pin it on me.
Clever, I'll give you that.

18:51.380 --> 18:52.339
[scoffs]

18:52.840 --> 18:54.508
You don't actually believe her.

18:54.591 --> 18:58.178
You are so desperately clinging
to the idea of one big, happy family,

18:58.262 --> 18:59.805
you can't see what she's doing.

19:00.305 --> 19:02.224
She doesn't care about your future.

19:02.307 --> 19:05.394
Probably because she knows
there's no other way to sink her claws

19:05.477 --> 19:07.604
into your part
of the fortune if he's there.

19:07.688 --> 19:10.774
Then why hasn't she asked me
for a single penny this whole time?

19:10.858 --> 19:13.652
I would have given her anything.
She hasn't had her hand out.

19:13.735 --> 19:17.573
You will go so far to prove a point that
sometimes you just miss it completely.

19:18.198 --> 19:22.202
So, don't involve my fiancé
in your insanity again,

19:22.286 --> 19:24.872
or you won't be invited to the wedding.

19:34.381 --> 19:36.633
You and Alexis always were
thick as thieves.

19:37.301 --> 19:38.343
She'd like to think so.

19:38.635 --> 19:41.346
I have never gone
against the best interests of this family.

19:41.889 --> 19:45.309
Did you force Culhane out
so that wretched beast could move in?

19:45.392 --> 19:46.226
Not at all.

19:46.727 --> 19:49.021
Although, once Culhane expressed
a desire to leave,

19:49.104 --> 19:51.732
I may have mentioned the vacancy.

19:51.982 --> 19:55.360
And I may have delivered
the photo albums to Fallon.

19:55.944 --> 19:57.112
An attempt at détente.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.364
And you were the one
that contacted Alexis.

19:59.448 --> 20:01.241
As executor of your father's will.

20:02.784 --> 20:05.662
This is not about the pull she has
over me,

20:05.871 --> 20:07.164
which I admit she does.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.000
It's about the effect she has on you,

20:10.083 --> 20:12.336
and the truth is
she's a big part of your life.

20:14.004 --> 20:16.506
At your father's house,
you said you missed her.

20:16.590 --> 20:18.884
-While you work out--
-There's nothing to work out.

20:19.593 --> 20:21.678
While you work out what that means,

20:21.762 --> 20:24.890
I have to protect you and this family
from your feud.

20:24.973 --> 20:26.934
I don't need protection.
Not from my ex-wife

20:27.017 --> 20:29.144
and certainly not
from a member of my staff.

20:29.686 --> 20:31.438
I will handle this. I'm a grown man.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.691
I am aware of that, I raised you.

20:36.985 --> 20:37.903
And now you're done.

20:38.987 --> 20:40.030
You're fired.

20:45.953 --> 20:47.496
Well, that was a nightmare.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.581
They were a nightmare.

20:49.665 --> 20:52.042
-The inmates?
-No, my mother and sister.

20:52.626 --> 20:54.878
Fallon says my mother
was trying to set you up

20:54.962 --> 20:57.297
and my mother says
Fallon is trying to set you up.

20:57.381 --> 20:59.841
So, any idea who's telling the truth?

20:59.925 --> 21:02.010
I won't get between a gay boy and his mom.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.720
-But you think she's lying?
-Look,

21:03.804 --> 21:07.391
I didn't see anything, but why would
Fallon all of a sudden turn on me?

21:08.267 --> 21:10.227
I just hate the "she said, she said."

21:10.894 --> 21:12.938
It's like junior high all over again.

21:14.314 --> 21:15.148
I get it.

21:16.024 --> 21:18.277
Even after all the bad things my mom did,

21:18.735 --> 21:20.862
a part of me was happy
she was back in my life.

21:21.613 --> 21:24.074
It's not really the same.
Your mom kidnapped my sister.

21:24.157 --> 21:26.743
If your sister's right,
your mom tried to put me in jail.

21:28.662 --> 21:31.164
It's never easy to realize
your parents are just people.

21:31.957 --> 21:34.418
Especially when they're not
the people you want.

21:34.501 --> 21:36.712
I was never the person
my father wanted me to be.

21:36.795 --> 21:38.255
Or Fallon for that matter.

21:38.755 --> 21:42.843
But my mom never had a problem
with who I was. She never doubted me.

21:45.846 --> 21:47.597
I just wanna give her the same chance.

21:54.021 --> 21:55.647
So, now you've fired Anders?

21:55.731 --> 21:57.941
Why? What happened?
Did he hire himself back?

21:58.900 --> 22:00.277
What are you thinking, Blake?

22:01.361 --> 22:04.489
Anders is your right-hand man.
Your father hired him.

22:06.116 --> 22:08.368
Is this some sort of reaction
to Thomas's death?

22:08.452 --> 22:09.286
Please don't.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.413
We're not in therapy yet.

22:12.956 --> 22:14.958
It's no reaction,
it's a business decision.

22:15.042 --> 22:16.043
Well, it's a poor one.

22:16.626 --> 22:18.503
Years of loyalty and service aside,

22:18.587 --> 22:21.631
what about the fact your son's
engagement party is tomorrow night?

22:21.715 --> 22:22.549
It's a dinner.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.427
Skeleton staff can handle it.

22:26.803 --> 22:29.473
It scares me that you can be so unfeeling

22:29.556 --> 22:33.477
towards people who have been
a vital part of your life and family.

22:33.852 --> 22:35.062
Anders, Culhane.

22:35.145 --> 22:36.188
Culhane left.

22:36.688 --> 22:38.523
And you haven't even asked why.

22:42.486 --> 22:43.612
This is our home.

22:44.946 --> 22:46.490
But it's also a business.

22:47.532 --> 22:49.576
And there's no room for sentimentality.

22:51.036 --> 22:53.872
All those years
I thought Anders was by my side,

22:53.955 --> 22:57.125
it turns out his loyalties still lie
with Alexis.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.795
So, that's what this is about. Her.

23:01.797 --> 23:03.256
Are you still in love with her?

23:04.341 --> 23:05.592
How can you ask me that?

23:07.135 --> 23:08.929
You've seen how miserable I have been

23:09.012 --> 23:11.306
since the moment
she walked back into this house.

23:17.145 --> 23:19.648
How can Steven not see through her lies?

23:19.731 --> 23:22.859
In his defense, it is plausible
you created that file yourself.

23:23.110 --> 23:26.530
That would be next-level diabolical
and take a ton of effort.

23:26.613 --> 23:28.824
You mean
like framing someone for shoplifting?

23:28.907 --> 23:31.785
Framing? I simply shifted the blame
onto the guilty party.

23:31.868 --> 23:35.038
Some would say I did the right thing.
You know, took the high road.

23:35.122 --> 23:38.458
You were just sending him memes
of your mom as the Wicked Witch.

23:38.542 --> 23:40.293
Some people are visual learners.

23:40.377 --> 23:43.004
You think I'm being harsh,
but you don't get the stakes.

23:43.088 --> 23:46.758
I mean my whole life, I could never
really count on either one of my parents.

23:47.134 --> 23:48.468
Steven was the only one.

23:49.052 --> 23:51.054
He was always in my corner,
no matter what.

23:51.138 --> 23:52.722
Right or wrong, thick or thin.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.683
That's what brothers are for.

23:54.766 --> 23:59.062
Yeah, but now with Alexis' loving mother
routine pulling the wool over his eyes,

23:59.146 --> 24:02.732
I'm afraid I might really lose him
to her forever.

24:02.816 --> 24:04.067
And then who would I have?

24:05.402 --> 24:06.820
Well, you'll always have me.

24:07.904 --> 24:10.031
-Until our contract expires.
-Exactly.

24:10.532 --> 24:12.033
Have you ever considered therapy?

24:13.118 --> 24:15.036
Just you, your mom...

24:15.370 --> 24:18.290
and a highly-educated
and courageous shrink?

24:18.373 --> 24:20.834
-Not enough drugs in the world.
-Funny you say that.

24:21.293 --> 24:24.379
My parents' therapist had them
do a session while candy-flipping.

24:24.462 --> 24:28.341
They got so high their truths came out.
Along with involuntary teeth clenching.

24:28.425 --> 24:30.427
But afterwards,
they were stronger than ever.

24:31.052 --> 24:32.929
After they both slept with the therapist.

24:33.013 --> 24:37.058
Well, as far as Steven is concerned,
it's still my word against hers.

24:37.142 --> 24:41.229
So, unless I can get her to tell the truth
without a lie detector or truth serum--

24:41.313 --> 24:43.523
[Sam] The one time I rolled,
it was a total disaster.

24:44.107 --> 24:45.984
I spent three hours in the subway

24:46.526 --> 24:48.778
telling complete strangers my life story.

24:49.321 --> 24:53.074
They thought I was some art installation
and I actually made, like, 20 bucks.

24:54.034 --> 24:57.245
But I told them everything,
and I mean everything.

24:57.829 --> 25:01.499
Now, I'm not saying I could
get the drugs for you, but if I could,

25:02.167 --> 25:05.253
-it might expose your mother.
-She's not gonna dose her mom.

25:05.337 --> 25:08.089
You don't know her then.
I've never seen you so desperate.

25:08.506 --> 25:12.052
I don't think you would be
if you weren't trying to prove the truth.

25:13.386 --> 25:15.013
So, let's prove it.

25:20.143 --> 25:21.603
[chattering]

25:21.686 --> 25:23.563
[mellow jazz music playing on piano]

25:24.147 --> 25:24.981
Thank you.

25:25.148 --> 25:28.902
I told them three times, but they
still couldn't find the right Grenache.

25:29.486 --> 25:31.154
-How is it?
-It's missing something.

25:32.197 --> 25:34.407
Maybe a dash of Mrs. Gunnerson.

25:35.408 --> 25:36.368
It can't be that bad.

25:39.287 --> 25:41.539
Have you hosted a party
without Anders before?

25:43.250 --> 25:44.501
This will be interesting.

25:49.631 --> 25:52.801
You sure you want to drug your mother
in front of Steven's friends?

25:52.884 --> 25:55.553
Relax, we're only spilling tea, not blood.

25:55.637 --> 25:58.139
I'd feel a lot more comfortable
if we had a plan B.

25:58.223 --> 26:00.267
I'd feel more comfortable
if we could rewind,

26:00.350 --> 26:03.561
to when my mother was living her best
<i>Grey Gardens</i> life in her trailer,

26:03.645 --> 26:04.479
but we can't.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.564
As long as we expose her,

26:06.648 --> 26:10.026
I don't care if we give her a horse
tranquilizer and she talks for a month.

26:10.110 --> 26:11.903
One night will be more than enough.

26:12.904 --> 26:14.531
Looks like your mark has arrived.

26:15.407 --> 26:18.243
-Let's go over the plan again.
-It's not <i>Ocean's Eleven</i>, Sam.

26:18.493 --> 26:20.036
Slip some Molly into her drink,

26:20.120 --> 26:23.456
I'll take her to the study and record
her confession about setting you up.

26:23.540 --> 26:26.960
-Don't over-complicate it.
-Well, there's one complication.

26:27.544 --> 26:28.670
I couldn't get Molly.

26:28.962 --> 26:32.299
My dealer gave me Dolly,
apparently the same thing.

26:32.966 --> 26:33.925
[sighs]

26:34.301 --> 26:36.928
Well, I guess if her designer handbags
are knockoffs,

26:37.304 --> 26:38.972
her designer drugs should be, too.

26:42.559 --> 26:43.393
Here we are.

26:44.436 --> 26:45.729
Parents of the groom.

26:46.521 --> 26:47.689
We should share a toast.

26:49.566 --> 26:53.486
Well, surely, we could put aside
our long national nightmare

26:53.862 --> 26:56.072
for the time it takes to clink a glass.

26:56.156 --> 26:56.990
To Steven...

26:57.949 --> 27:01.953
who's getting married despite our efforts
to prove the institution is a sham.

27:02.370 --> 27:03.663
[Alexis chuckles]

27:08.626 --> 27:10.045
Curious soirée.

27:10.879 --> 27:13.173
A bit more eclectic than I expected.

27:13.798 --> 27:15.050
Are we trying to be modern?

27:15.216 --> 27:16.509
I get the subtext.

27:17.093 --> 27:18.136
I fired Anders.

27:18.219 --> 27:21.681
-That's why the pâté tastes like cat food.
-Eating cat food in that trailer?

27:22.724 --> 27:24.017
How could you fire Anders?

27:24.434 --> 27:25.268
He's family.

27:25.518 --> 27:27.937
He's been here
for every milestone in Steven's life.

27:29.022 --> 27:29.856
And yours.

27:30.690 --> 27:34.694
Do you remember that story when you
found out that Anders was the tooth fairy?

27:35.403 --> 27:38.198
You were sick of silver dollars
and you wanted a Lego set.

27:38.740 --> 27:42.911
He spent hours and hours putting that
thing together and then he stepped on it

27:42.994 --> 27:46.039
-and woke you up.
-That's when he became a Lego fan.

27:46.831 --> 27:48.750
He has the Sydney Opera House in his room.

27:48.833 --> 27:49.709
He's a gem.

27:50.210 --> 27:53.129
Always trying to uphold tradition
in the face of chaos.

27:53.213 --> 27:55.423
He kept our children safe
in our hurricane.

27:55.507 --> 27:58.760
Give us a little credit.
It wasn't always stormy.

28:03.932 --> 28:04.766
Well...

28:05.517 --> 28:07.227
I have a party to tend to,

28:08.061 --> 28:09.646
short-staffed and whatnot.

28:24.536 --> 28:27.372
[Alexis] How do you do? It's a pleasure.
I've heard wonderful things.

28:29.999 --> 28:33.962
Mrs. Carrington, Alexis, Mommy.

28:34.045 --> 28:35.547
You look amazing.

28:36.089 --> 28:39.092
But you need to warn us
when you let the cougar out of the cage.

28:40.176 --> 28:41.511
Now, how beautiful is this?

29:00.530 --> 29:02.282
[inaudible dialogue]

29:04.242 --> 29:06.244
Thank the staff for packing up my stuff.

29:06.327 --> 29:08.788
I've got a long drive ahead,
so I should get going.

29:08.872 --> 29:11.458
Why don't you stay for a moment?
The hospital's not far.

29:11.541 --> 29:14.419
No, but my family's house
is way out in Clarke County.

29:16.629 --> 29:18.757
[inaudible dialogue]

29:18.840 --> 29:21.384
Clarke County?
How long have they lived there?

29:21.468 --> 29:22.635
That's where I grew up.

29:24.429 --> 29:25.263
Really?

29:25.346 --> 29:26.973
You've ignored my texts for weeks,

29:27.056 --> 29:30.393
-but you can come to talk to Cristal?
-I'm gonna give you two some space.

29:31.060 --> 29:33.646
I mean, you couldn't even send
a "talk to the hand" emoji?

29:33.730 --> 29:35.356
You left without saying goodbye?

29:35.440 --> 29:37.650
Boyfriends aren't required
to give exit interviews.

29:38.568 --> 29:41.654
If I'd told you, you would have
just tried to convince me to stay.

29:42.238 --> 29:44.532
And I can't be in heavy rotation
for you anymore.

29:44.908 --> 29:47.285
Not to mention,
you've got a fake marriage to uphold.

29:47.368 --> 29:49.078
-So, that's what this is about?
-No.

29:49.162 --> 29:51.414
This is about years
of you putting yourself first,

29:51.498 --> 29:54.250
-and me putting my life on hold.
-We can't even be friends?

29:54.334 --> 29:58.129
What exactly would us being friends
look like, just out of curiosity? When you need me, I'd be there for you
like when you were there for me.

30:02.091 --> 30:03.009
That's all I mean.

30:03.510 --> 30:04.928
Being there for you
was my job.

30:05.637 --> 30:06.554
Then pay me.

30:07.388 --> 30:09.349
You know, just as a friend.

30:09.432 --> 30:11.142
I don't think you qualify, Fallon.

30:13.061 --> 30:14.020
And you know...

30:16.272 --> 30:17.732
we can never be friends.

30:27.075 --> 30:27.909
[Liam] Fallon.

30:30.787 --> 30:33.873
You wanted to do this
before they served dinner. It's time.

30:45.468 --> 30:48.930
Mom, do you think
we could put our war on hold?

30:49.055 --> 30:51.808
At least for tonight.
Let Steven and Sam have a little peace.

30:51.891 --> 30:54.519
And then we can get back
to backstabbing and name-calling.

30:54.644 --> 30:56.729
-Aren't you the sweetest?
-[Fallon] Hmm.

30:58.314 --> 31:00.692
To love that never dies.

31:00.775 --> 31:02.569
And a night we'll never forget.

31:17.750 --> 31:18.585
Hi.

31:20.003 --> 31:21.671
So, how does that work?

31:22.672 --> 31:26.926
Sam being such a connoisseur
of Champagne in public?

31:27.385 --> 31:28.219
What do you mean?

31:29.262 --> 31:31.973
You've announced to the world
that you're in recovery.

31:32.056 --> 31:33.808
You are trying to build up a campaign.

31:33.892 --> 31:36.561
Well, I have some PR to do
once the engagement goes public,

31:36.644 --> 31:38.438
considering the story with Ted, but--

31:38.521 --> 31:40.565
Exactly.
You just don't need another issue.

31:41.566 --> 31:43.026
He's not much of a first lady.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.571
But if it's a project you want,

31:46.654 --> 31:49.073
I will be right here to help you
whip him into shape.

31:56.247 --> 31:57.749
I mean, she seems totally normal.

31:58.291 --> 32:00.168
Maybe she's got some insane tolerance.

32:00.251 --> 32:02.462
I doubt it.
She doesn't seem the Coachella type.

32:06.507 --> 32:07.508
He does though.

32:07.592 --> 32:10.929
You guys are great. It's really...
It's really good.

32:11.012 --> 32:11.888
Oh, my God.

32:12.972 --> 32:14.557
Did I mix up the glasses?

32:15.016 --> 32:17.393
Oh, God. Culhane threw me off my game.

32:17.769 --> 32:20.688
And Steven told me to leave Sam
out of this. Now she's gonna win.

32:21.272 --> 32:23.650
I would get him out of here if I were you.

32:28.738 --> 32:29.614
[exhales sharply]

32:29.697 --> 32:31.074
I think I had the wrong glass.

32:31.157 --> 32:33.785
-Yeah, no kidding.
-No, but it's okay, it's okay.

32:34.243 --> 32:36.746
I mean, I think we should all be high.

32:36.829 --> 32:38.790
You know? Screw family feuding.

32:38.873 --> 32:40.583
We're celebrating love. Life. I want to give a speech.

32:43.211 --> 32:44.837
-No!
-A toast.

I think he's overdosing on something.

Oh, my God, am I?

33:52.947 --> 33:54.741
-Just roll with it.
-Is there a doctor?

33:54.824 --> 33:56.826
Oh, my God, his heart is racing.

33:57.452 --> 33:59.579
I think someone slipped something
in his drink.

34:00.496 --> 34:03.374
Oh, Mom. Tell me you didn't.

34:03.458 --> 34:06.294
What? What are you talking about?
Somebody call an ambulance.

34:06.377 --> 34:08.963
What did you put in his drink?
You don't want him to die.

34:09.047 --> 34:12.467
-I didn't give him anything.
-Just like you didn't try to frame him.

34:12.550 --> 34:15.636
There's a difference between lacing
a drink and slipping a watch in your bag.

34:17.472 --> 34:18.514
And there it is.

34:18.598 --> 34:20.224
-I think I'm good.
-I'm not.

34:20.933 --> 34:25.146
-You tried to have my fiancé arrested?
-No. Well, [sighs] I'll explain later.

34:25.228 --> 34:26.188
Don't bother.

34:34.530 --> 34:35.406
Thank you.

34:36.324 --> 34:39.243
I guess we should wait
before jumping into your wedding plans.

34:39.327 --> 34:40.286
You're kidding.

34:40.369 --> 34:44.081
I thought it was a solid joke, but fine.
Hire a professional. What do I care?

34:44.165 --> 34:47.585
I warned you not to put Sam in the middle,
and that's exactly what you did.

34:48.168 --> 34:50.670
Not to mention you embarrassed me
in front of our friends.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.340
I have major damage control to do

34:52.422 --> 34:56.094
because you brought hug drugs
to a sober politician's engagement party.

34:56.552 --> 34:57.678
I brought it.

34:58.471 --> 35:01.724
It was my bad idea based off
of my parents' weird therapist.

35:01.808 --> 35:02.725
It's a long story.

35:03.226 --> 35:04.769
Sam had nothing to do with it.

35:05.645 --> 35:07.355
We were supposed to give it to Mom.

35:07.897 --> 35:10.566
-It's okay, all right? It was kind of fun.
-Baby. Shh.

35:13.027 --> 35:15.029
What kind of a person
drugs their mother?

35:15.113 --> 35:17.323
What kind person frames her son's fiancé?

35:17.406 --> 35:18.366
The same kind.

35:19.909 --> 35:21.577
You're just like her, Fallon.

35:21.786 --> 35:25.414
You go to the ends of the earth to prove
a point, without caring who you hurt.

35:25.957 --> 35:28.042
This party was to celebrate our engagement

35:28.126 --> 35:30.461
and you turned it
into the battleground for a war

35:30.545 --> 35:32.797
I've been trying to end
from the beginning.

35:32.880 --> 35:36.092
-That's on you for not picking a side.
-I did pick a side. Mine.

35:36.467 --> 35:38.886
For once in my life,
but you just weren't having it.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.096
Come on, just relax.

35:45.434 --> 35:46.269
Are you okay?

35:48.104 --> 35:49.647
I wish I could cheer you up.

35:49.939 --> 35:53.943
I'd offer you the rest of Sam's supply,
but, uh, it's probably not a good idea.

35:54.026 --> 35:55.153
Yeah, not a good idea.

35:56.612 --> 35:57.613
Why did you do that?

35:58.406 --> 35:59.240
What?

36:00.199 --> 36:01.284
Oh, take the blame.

36:02.952 --> 36:05.079
I figured I have no skin in this.

36:05.955 --> 36:09.125
You do. I was trying to protect
your relationship with your brother.

36:09.208 --> 36:10.042
But why?

36:10.668 --> 36:13.087
Since you got here,
you've done nothing but help me.

36:13.171 --> 36:16.007
At the courthouse.
When my grandfather died.

36:16.716 --> 36:18.467
Ever since Cersei returned to reign.

36:19.177 --> 36:22.096
It's not a part of your contract,
you know, being nice.

36:22.805 --> 36:24.056
Yeah, I know.

36:24.140 --> 36:27.810
Well I don't get that, but I've also
been told I'm a terrible friend.

36:27.894 --> 36:28.978
See, that's not true...

36:30.771 --> 36:32.690
or else you wouldn't have protected Sam.

36:34.692 --> 36:37.195
I see you, Fallon Carrington.

36:49.332 --> 36:50.499
[Fallon chuckles]

36:51.167 --> 36:53.544
I've been wanting to do that
since the day I met you.

36:53.669 --> 36:55.254
But then marriage got in the way?

36:55.755 --> 36:57.381
Something always does, doesn't it?

37:00.092 --> 37:00.927
Get some sleep.

37:11.771 --> 37:14.649
I hope you know how sorry I am
about all of this.

37:14.732 --> 37:17.276
I didn't come to forgive you.
I came to ask you to leave.

37:18.986 --> 37:20.863
I'm a screwed-up person, Steven.

37:22.531 --> 37:25.576
-That's part of why I stayed away.
-Then why did you come back?

37:28.246 --> 37:31.374
Was it really about us
or did you just miss being rich?

37:31.457 --> 37:32.625
It was never about money.

37:34.669 --> 37:36.963
I finally have you fully back

37:37.046 --> 37:39.507
and then there's this boy
that I don't know.

37:40.049 --> 37:41.384
And you met him because

37:41.467 --> 37:44.637
-that floozy aunt of his married--
-Don't talk that way about Cristal.

37:46.430 --> 37:48.891
I was afraid that Sam
would take you away from me.

37:48.975 --> 37:53.104
All this talk about traveling
and moving to South America.

37:53.479 --> 37:55.481
I know that a mother...

37:56.857 --> 37:58.985
should be able to let go at my age.

37:59.527 --> 38:02.154
But I have lost so many years with you.

38:02.697 --> 38:04.907
And I don't want to lose another son.

38:07.118 --> 38:07.952
What?

38:08.953 --> 38:11.414
You're not the first-born Carrington,
Steven.

38:18.421 --> 38:22.216
There was a baby boy, named Adam.

38:25.386 --> 38:27.680
-He was kidnapped.
-Mom.

38:27.763 --> 38:31.225
Your father and I did everything
the police wanted us to do.

38:33.602 --> 38:34.437
But...

38:35.563 --> 38:37.648
But we didn't get our son back.

38:38.107 --> 38:39.650
And we lost our marriage.

38:39.734 --> 38:42.028
When your father took you and Fallon
away from me,

38:42.111 --> 38:43.779
I started looking for Adam again.

38:43.904 --> 38:45.948
That's where my money went.

38:47.033 --> 38:50.244
I have hired investigators,
psychics, anything.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.788
Anything to find a-- A trace.

38:54.248 --> 38:55.166
And it...

38:55.958 --> 38:57.293
consumed me.

38:57.835 --> 39:00.963
-How do you know he's alive?
-Because I don't know that he's dead.

39:02.506 --> 39:03.507
There...

39:04.091 --> 39:05.468
There's always a trail.

39:07.595 --> 39:11.557
And when I ran out of money,
there was a PI in D.C.,

39:11.640 --> 39:15.144
and he had tracked him
all the way to El Paso.

39:15.227 --> 39:19.065
Was there proof that Adam was there?

39:19.607 --> 39:23.736
And if money's the reason you stopped,
we can help with that.

39:23.819 --> 39:26.238
-You don't think I should give up?
-How could we?

39:29.200 --> 39:30.201
It's my brother.

39:38.542 --> 39:41.837
-You wanted to see me?
-Yes.

39:43.381 --> 39:44.507
I regret my decision.

39:45.466 --> 39:48.511
Your absence throws the staff off course.

39:49.470 --> 39:53.516
The party last night was a disaster
I'm sure you could have prevented.

39:55.142 --> 39:56.394
And I need you, too.

39:56.477 --> 39:58.521
You are invaluable to this family.

40:00.856 --> 40:01.690
Good. Well...

40:05.027 --> 40:06.862
Fortunately,
I haven't made other plans.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.949
-So, you're available then?
-I'm sure I could find time.

40:10.199 --> 40:12.993
And I'll make a point of avoiding Alexis.

40:13.452 --> 40:14.412
The staff will, too.

40:16.288 --> 40:17.498
You know, the truth is...

40:21.669 --> 40:22.920
I've been a hypocrite.

40:23.921 --> 40:26.924
Blaming you for being swayed by her...

40:28.676 --> 40:29.635
when you were right.

40:30.803 --> 40:31.720
I am, too.

40:33.639 --> 40:36.517
I trusted her with everything,
the mother of my children.

40:36.600 --> 40:39.854
Even after all these years,
I just find it hard to get over

40:40.729 --> 40:41.730
what she did.

40:43.232 --> 40:44.066
And yet...

40:46.402 --> 40:47.570
she still has a pull.

40:48.404 --> 40:50.406
You know me, Anders,
better than anyone.

40:50.489 --> 40:52.158
And I need you to steady me here.

40:52.783 --> 40:54.160
In this and everything. For all the icebergs ahead.

40:57.913 --> 41:01.834
Unfortunately, there may be
a rather large one on its way.

41:02.376 --> 41:04.170
I've been overprotective in general.

41:04.253 --> 41:06.589
I didn't tell you about Culhane's family.

41:07.131 --> 41:09.216
I thought it was best
for the company...

41:10.050 --> 41:13.596
-if you remained in the dark.
-What does his family have to do with us?

41:13.679 --> 41:16.056
There's something you don't know
about his father.

41:21.729 --> 41:25.441
<i>He's quite ill, sir, with a certain</i>
<i>diagnosis that may ring a bell.</i>

41:26.442 --> 41:28.569
He has acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

41:30.446 --> 41:35.409
-<i>It's linked to environmental factors.</i>
-My family's house is in Clarke County.

41:35.951 --> 41:37.119
[Anders] <i>As you surely recall,</i>

41:37.203 --> 41:41.207
<i>CA faced a scandal</i>
<i>in Northeastern Georgia a few years back.</i>

41:42.917 --> 41:47.880
<i>If Culhane realizes the connection between</i>
<i>his father's disease and what CA hid,</i>

41:48.464 --> 41:50.591
<i>it might not be so easy</i>
<i>to handle this time.</i>

41:54.803 --> 41:58.140
Sorry to drop by so early,
but I really need to talk to you.

41:59.975 --> 42:00.809
[Blake] Honey.

42:02.186 --> 42:03.479
Thank you for being here.
