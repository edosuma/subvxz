WEBVTT

00:05.124 --> 00:06.687
Whoa!

00:07.596 --> 00:09.738
Twilight! Mail's here!

00:14.506 --> 00:15.980
Are you all right?

00:17.209 --> 00:21.160
Just had a really
heavy delivery today.

00:21.420 --> 00:23.728
Is it a deluxe set of Special
Edition Ogres & Oubliettes

00:23.816 --> 00:25.198
figurines that I'm
totally surprised by

00:25.285 --> 00:27.172
and haven't been hinting
that I need forever?

00:27.259 --> 00:30.075
Well... it's
for Twilight.

00:30.162 --> 00:31.476
Awww.

00:31.691 --> 00:32.847
Thank you!

00:32.935 --> 00:34.549
You're welcome!

00:34.825 --> 00:36.896
Huh, it's from
Princess Celestia.

00:39.105 --> 00:40.722
So's this.
Really?

00:40.810 --> 00:42.872
She couldn't have
put it into the box?

00:43.341 --> 00:45.878
"My Dearest Twilight.
I have been conducting

00:45.966 --> 00:47.425
a thorough cleaning
of the castle,

00:47.513 --> 00:50.542
and I came across a few items
of yours in your old room.

00:50.630 --> 00:52.330
I thought you might
want them back."

00:52.417 --> 00:54.583
I didn't even know
I'd left anything!

00:55.708 --> 00:57.035
Aw, look!

00:57.122 --> 01:00.105
Remember this? It's the
macaroni picture frame.

01:00.193 --> 01:02.255
Cadance helped me make
when I was a filly!

01:04.563 --> 01:06.919
Who could forget a
masterpiece like that?

01:08.133 --> 01:10.146
My G1 Starswirl figure!

01:10.234 --> 01:12.716
And some of my favorite
school scrolls!

01:13.077 --> 01:15.605
And here's my extra,
extra credit report

01:15.693 --> 01:19.357
on "The Impediments of Using
Magic in Everyday Chores"!

01:20.027 --> 01:22.409
Ha! Still so true!

01:22.566 --> 01:24.281
Is my Smash Fortune
comic in there?

01:24.416 --> 01:25.857
I've been looking
for that for years!

01:26.005 --> 01:27.680
Agh!

01:29.187 --> 01:30.325
Hold this.

01:30.747 --> 01:32.841
Oh, no, oh no, oh no!

01:32.933 --> 01:35.771
What's wrong? It just looks
like an old library book.

01:35.966 --> 01:39.318
Exactly! It belongs to
the Canterlot Library.

01:39.435 --> 01:40.716
That means it's...

01:43.653 --> 01:45.512

02:25.310 --> 02:26.935
You don't understand, Spike.

02:27.044 --> 02:29.294
I have a perfect library
book-return record!

02:29.381 --> 02:30.228
Ahem.

02:30.315 --> 02:32.279
Had a perfect record.

02:32.497 --> 02:35.983
I've never turned in a
book even a minute late!

02:36.112 --> 02:37.559
And this one...

02:37.647 --> 02:40.787
has been overdue since
I left for Ponyville!

02:42.000 --> 02:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:56.019 --> 02:58.611
Make sure you bring
this one back on time.

02:58.699 --> 03:00.924
We've got a long
waiting list of ponies

03:01.020 --> 03:03.027
who can't wait to read it!

03:03.129 --> 03:05.441
I promise I won't
let you down!

03:05.621 --> 03:07.869
Of course you
won't, dear.

03:07.957 --> 03:11.072
If there's anypony I can
trust to take care of a book,

03:11.160 --> 03:13.461
it's you, Twilight Sparkle!

03:13.548 --> 03:18.183
After all, you still hold the
"Best Book Borrower" title.

03:19.676 --> 03:23.074
Ooh! I hope I do forever!

03:24.340 --> 03:28.127
Spike! Quick! Find
me that old copy of.

03:28.215 --> 03:31.457
"Predictions and Prophecies".
What's that for?

03:32.269 --> 03:35.449
Well, it was a gift
for Moondancer but...

03:36.538 --> 03:37.586
Oh, Spike.

03:37.673 --> 03:40.152
You know we don't have time
for that sort of thing.

03:42.010 --> 03:43.890
And then Celestia
sent me to Ponyville

03:43.978 --> 03:45.473
and I forgot
all about this!

03:45.621 --> 03:48.441
Dusty Pages prided herself
that no books were damaged

03:48.529 --> 03:49.910
or lost on her watch.

03:49.998 --> 03:53.113
And I failed her!
I've failed MYSELF!

03:53.245 --> 03:55.285
I take it we're
going to Canterlot.

03:57.892 --> 04:01.433
The sooner the
better, I guess.

04:12.207 --> 04:14.207
Uh, why are we hiding?

04:14.295 --> 04:15.933
Don't you want to
return your book?

04:16.027 --> 04:18.509
Yes, but what if somepony
sees me in there?

04:18.603 --> 04:20.286
I'm the Princess
of Friendship.

04:20.397 --> 04:22.545
Everywhere I go,
ponies recognize me.

04:22.671 --> 04:24.418
I'll stick out
like a sore hoof!

04:24.611 --> 04:28.935
Princess Twilight Sparkle in
a library? Stop the presses!

04:29.023 --> 04:31.105
A late book is a
big deal, Spike!

04:31.192 --> 04:34.004
What if Dusty Pages
revokes my library card?

04:35.499 --> 04:38.527
Or bans me from ever
entering the building again?

04:39.521 --> 04:40.903
Don't you already have
most of those books

04:40.990 --> 04:42.571
in your collection at home?

04:42.664 --> 04:44.931
Yes, but the ones in
there have a special.

04:45.019 --> 04:47.027
Canterlot Library-y smell!

04:47.132 --> 04:48.346
You sniff books?

04:48.434 --> 04:49.894
You don't?

04:52.779 --> 04:55.996
I used to live in a library!
If I'm not a good example

04:56.084 --> 04:57.899
of proper book-borrowing
behavior,

04:57.986 --> 05:00.074
then what kind of
princess am I?

05:00.358 --> 05:03.090
One that makes mistakes
like everypony else.

05:03.178 --> 05:06.828
Trust me, once you return that
book, you'll feel way better.

05:07.028 --> 05:08.129
Thanks, Spike.

05:08.217 --> 05:09.306
Let's go.

05:09.417 --> 05:10.598
Agh!

05:28.616 --> 05:30.644
I have a book to return.

05:30.732 --> 05:34.973
Princess Twilight!
So good to see you!

05:36.670 --> 05:39.457
Need some recommendations
from the new release section?

05:39.840 --> 05:41.842
Is that the
new edition of.

05:41.930 --> 05:44.145
"Mooncurve's Seven
Theories on Bending Time"?

05:44.232 --> 05:46.348
I have been waiting
for the release since...

05:47.397 --> 05:50.855
I mean, uh, no
books today, thanks.

05:52.623 --> 05:55.848
But I do need to speak with
Dusty Pages about a...

05:55.988 --> 05:57.605
Sensitive matter.

05:57.812 --> 05:58.960
Dusty who?

06:00.148 --> 06:02.379
Dusty Pages! The head librarian?

06:02.467 --> 06:04.223
She's worked here forever.

06:06.514 --> 06:08.229
I'm sorry, Princess.
I don't know her.

06:08.363 --> 06:10.504
Now, was there some
other way I can help

06:10.592 --> 06:13.223
the Library's Best
Book Borrower?

06:17.130 --> 06:19.446
Just ask her where to
return an overdue book.

06:19.534 --> 06:21.816
It's no big deal. It
happens all the time!

06:21.904 --> 06:23.558
Not to me, it doesn't!

06:25.503 --> 06:27.363
Fine.

06:27.599 --> 06:30.676
Fine! Oh, no. I didn't even
think about the late fine!

06:30.764 --> 06:32.276
A book out this long
will probably cost

06:32.363 --> 06:33.715
a thousand bits!

06:35.249 --> 06:38.769
She... I mean we, have
an overdue book.

06:38.949 --> 06:42.168
Well, that's no
problem at all.

06:42.256 --> 06:44.777
In fact, it happens
all the time!

06:45.059 --> 06:46.277
See?

06:47.387 --> 06:49.629
I'll just find it
in the card catalog.

06:50.027 --> 06:53.504
Number one-eight-nine-oh-five.
Got it!

06:54.175 --> 06:56.473
Ohhhhh, wow. Eeeesh.

06:56.561 --> 07:00.605
I haven't seen a book
this late in, well, ever.

07:00.693 --> 07:02.923
You need to go and
see First Folio

07:03.112 --> 07:05.613
in the "Grossly Overdue
Book Return Office

07:05.701 --> 07:08.079
for Ponies Who
Should Know Better."

07:08.312 --> 07:11.574
Don't pull any punches
with those names, do ya?

07:11.837 --> 07:13.988
And that office would be...?

07:14.096 --> 07:17.848
In the basement.
Because of the shame.

07:24.027 --> 07:28.183
Whoa. Looks like nopony
ever goes down here.

07:28.271 --> 07:30.910
Nopony except
undependable rule breakers

07:31.012 --> 07:33.176
who deserve all the
horrors this hallway holds.

07:33.264 --> 07:35.951
And their faithful
dragon companions.

07:36.046 --> 07:39.638
Hey, looks like First Folio
left a note on the door.

07:39.726 --> 07:42.154
Abandon hope all
ye who enter?

07:42.824 --> 07:45.037
"Out to lunch on
Restaurant Row."

07:45.125 --> 07:46.973
Guess we'll have
to try back later.

07:47.069 --> 07:50.452
Oh, no. I can't wait another
minute to return this book!

07:50.593 --> 07:51.950
In the time it took
us to get there,

07:52.037 --> 07:53.638
I racked up another...

07:54.541 --> 07:56.656
Seventeen bits in late fees!

07:56.744 --> 07:58.068
We're going to lunch!

07:58.156 --> 07:59.871
Good, cause I'm starving!

08:02.349 --> 08:04.912
Oh. You mean to
find First Folio.

08:05.317 --> 08:07.302
Can we at least
get take-out?

08:09.714 --> 08:12.258
Tell me if you see any
librarian-type ponies.

08:12.346 --> 08:13.628
Twilight, we've
tried this

08:13.687 --> 08:15.521
at three other
restaurants already.

08:15.609 --> 08:17.316
And my late fines
are already up

08:17.404 --> 08:19.200
another 26 more bits!

08:22.058 --> 08:24.474
Waiter, we're
ready to order.

08:24.608 --> 08:26.007
Oh, I'm not actually a...-

08:26.095 --> 08:28.316
Three samosas, two
curry specials...

08:28.404 --> 08:30.150
Do you think that's
enough for the two of us?

08:30.237 --> 08:34.357
I would probably order some
Naan as well? For the table.

08:34.501 --> 08:35.958
Sounds great!

08:36.236 --> 08:38.365
Twilight? Is that you?

08:38.529 --> 08:40.763
Moondancer! How
have you been?

08:41.001 --> 08:44.118
I'm just visiting.
No real reason. Heh.

08:44.307 --> 08:47.057
Well, it's good to see you!
I'm just meeting my friend,

08:47.145 --> 08:49.763
First Folio, for lunch.
Do you want to join us?

08:49.884 --> 08:53.067
First Folio? YES!
I mean, thank you.

08:53.161 --> 08:56.529
Princess Twilight!
Good to meet you!

08:56.617 --> 08:59.857
Did you know your picture
is still up in our library

08:59.945 --> 09:01.893
as the Best Book Borrower.

09:02.029 --> 09:03.207
Yeeeeah.

09:03.295 --> 09:05.787
I was hoping I could talk
to Dusty Pages about that.

09:05.875 --> 09:09.258
Oh, Dusty Pages left
the library moons ago.

09:09.419 --> 09:10.700
Didn't you know?

09:10.788 --> 09:11.951
Mm mm.

09:12.039 --> 09:15.222
Oh, I heard she was
forced to leave.

09:15.309 --> 09:18.926
It's so sad. She
loved the library.

09:19.013 --> 09:21.380
Wait. Forced to leave?

09:21.502 --> 09:25.686
Uh huh, yeah. She had a
perfect librarian record,

09:25.820 --> 09:29.103
until one careless pony
didn't return a book

09:29.190 --> 09:31.038
and ruined it all.

09:31.125 --> 09:32.940
Are you OK, Twilight?

09:34.216 --> 09:36.977
Uh huh... Would...
you excuse me?

09:39.985 --> 09:42.904
That's why you only order
spicy if you can take it.

09:43.873 --> 09:45.485
Twilight, what's wrong?

09:45.573 --> 09:47.972
Dusty Pages isn't working
at the library anymore

09:48.060 --> 09:49.880
because I didn't
return this book.

09:50.077 --> 09:53.615
Spike! I think I got her FIRED!

09:58.700 --> 10:01.912
Twilight! The
library is that way!

10:02.238 --> 10:04.987
Change of plans! We're
going to Dusty's house.

10:05.198 --> 10:07.849
She used to invite me
over for tea all the time.

10:08.029 --> 10:09.685
But what about your late fees?

10:09.812 --> 10:12.373
They're not as important
as making things right.

10:12.493 --> 10:15.310
Wait, so you're not
going to return the book?

10:15.588 --> 10:19.905
No. Dusty Pages is! It's
my fault she lost her job.

10:20.274 --> 10:23.131
So if I give her the book,
she can get her old job back!

10:23.674 --> 10:25.514
It'll fix everything!

10:33.187 --> 10:34.896
Didn't ya see the sign?

10:35.623 --> 10:38.490
"No Salesponies"!

10:38.688 --> 10:40.803
Oh, I'm not
selling anything!

10:40.967 --> 10:42.607
No carolers either.

10:42.695 --> 10:47.279
No surveys, no petitions,
no free literature...

10:51.567 --> 10:52.615
No problem!

10:52.703 --> 10:54.750
I'm just looking for somepony
who used to live here.

10:54.938 --> 10:56.990
I'm pretty sure
this was her house.

10:57.078 --> 10:58.654
Dusty Pages?

10:58.742 --> 10:59.769
Yes!

10:59.857 --> 11:01.107
Hold on.

11:03.618 --> 11:05.900
She moved to Silver somethin'.

11:05.987 --> 11:09.068
Shoals? Seas? Surfer? Whatever.

11:09.156 --> 11:11.318
When you find her,
give her this.

11:14.495 --> 11:16.277
Been stackin' up
for years.

11:16.364 --> 11:19.600
And tell her to
change her address!

12:06.674 --> 12:10.252
Silverstable Community
for the best Golden Years.

12:10.340 --> 12:11.954
This has to be it!

12:12.042 --> 12:13.947
I hope so.

12:14.035 --> 12:17.252
It's the last "Silver" spot
on the map we haven't looked.

12:21.611 --> 12:24.750
Whoa. This place is...

12:24.838 --> 12:26.143
Terrible, I know!

12:26.233 --> 12:29.049
There's not a single
bookshelf in sight.

12:29.403 --> 12:31.285
Poor Dusty.

12:31.372 --> 12:32.486
Excuse me.

12:32.573 --> 12:34.866
Yes. How may I help you?

12:35.072 --> 12:37.546
Do you have a resident
named Dusty Pages?

12:37.650 --> 12:40.795
Oh, yes! Her apartment
is in the next complex.

12:40.883 --> 12:42.183
Ground floor.

12:42.749 --> 12:44.085
Thank you!

12:47.624 --> 12:50.827
I can't believe that my
carelessness sent her here

12:50.915 --> 12:52.382
when she could be
happily surrounded

12:52.470 --> 12:55.094
by millions of
wonderful-smelling books.

12:55.182 --> 12:58.217
You realize that might just
be a "you" thing, right?

13:00.701 --> 13:02.836
There she is! Here we go.

13:17.351 --> 13:18.832
Aarrgghh!

13:18.920 --> 13:20.461
She's bound to
be back soon.

13:20.549 --> 13:22.342
Maybe we should just wait here.

13:22.430 --> 13:24.605
No. We are
fixing this now.

13:24.692 --> 13:27.781
This place isn't that
big. We can find her!

13:32.024 --> 13:34.306
Sorry to interrupt your
plein air painting,

13:34.394 --> 13:37.283
but we're looking for Dusty
Pages. Have you seen her?

13:37.371 --> 13:38.899
Sure have.

13:43.403 --> 13:45.063
And...?

13:45.873 --> 13:48.528
She had to leave
early to get to her

13:48.616 --> 13:50.731
fengbi de ti session.

13:50.818 --> 13:52.433
Which is right
before she leads

13:52.520 --> 13:54.570
the woodworking
class with me.

13:54.762 --> 13:56.844
Then she's on
to windsurfing!

13:56.932 --> 14:00.133
Don't forget theatre rehearsal!

14:00.227 --> 14:04.297
Dusty's playing the
lead role... again.

14:04.433 --> 14:07.352
Then there's her
band practice later.

14:07.468 --> 14:08.797
Thank you!

14:09.736 --> 14:13.344
Wow, Dusty sounds
like one busy pony.

14:13.432 --> 14:15.584
She's just filling her
days with distractions

14:15.672 --> 14:18.559
to cover the pain of
losing the best job ever.

14:18.646 --> 14:20.680
But not for long!

15:22.149 --> 15:25.599
DUSTY PAGES! Finally!
C'mon, Spike.

15:25.803 --> 15:28.850
Wait. She looks
pretty happy up there.

15:32.975 --> 15:34.803
Trust me, it's
all an act.

15:34.891 --> 15:37.236
She'll be a lot happier
when I deliver the good news

15:37.324 --> 15:39.530
that she can go back to
working at the library!

15:42.423 --> 15:44.538
Care to take five, everypony?

15:44.683 --> 15:48.608
Twilight Sparkle? My stars!

15:49.505 --> 15:51.584
It's so wonderful to see you!

15:51.672 --> 15:53.382
What are you
doing here?

15:53.470 --> 15:56.019
I've been looking all
over Equestria for you!

15:56.107 --> 15:58.224
I need to tell
you something.

15:58.312 --> 16:01.522
You brought my
mail! Oh, thank you!

16:02.736 --> 16:06.936
No. I mean, yes, we did, but
that's not why we're here.

16:07.024 --> 16:08.305
I let you down.

16:08.393 --> 16:11.242
And I can't forgive myself
until I set things right.

16:11.330 --> 16:14.479
I don't remember you
doing anything wrong.

16:14.603 --> 16:17.139
You told me to take special
care of a book I checked out

16:17.227 --> 16:20.288
from the Canterlot library.
And I never brought it back!

16:20.548 --> 16:22.983
It was you that
had that book out?

16:23.071 --> 16:26.085
The one that broke
my perfect record?

16:27.634 --> 16:29.919
But now you can bring
it to Canterlot Library

16:30.007 --> 16:31.671
and get your job back!

16:31.759 --> 16:33.173
No thank you!

16:33.261 --> 16:36.477
I don't ever need to
see that library again.

16:36.565 --> 16:39.811
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have somewhere to be!

16:48.442 --> 16:49.575
Do you mind?

16:54.345 --> 16:55.764
I don't understand.

16:55.860 --> 16:58.348
If Dusty Pages won't go
back to Canterlot Library

16:58.436 --> 16:59.553
and explain everything,

16:59.640 --> 17:01.374
then she won't be able
to get her job back.

17:01.462 --> 17:04.944
Even worse, her record
will remain... imperfect!

17:05.093 --> 17:07.075
And yours will, too?

17:07.209 --> 17:09.858
Well. Yeah! But that
doesn't matter anymore.

17:09.945 --> 17:10.989
Really?

17:11.077 --> 17:13.567
Well, maybe a little
bit. Oh, no... BITS!

17:13.654 --> 17:16.388
The late fines! How
much do I owe now?

17:21.651 --> 17:23.366
Uh... You don't want to know.

17:24.595 --> 17:26.809
It would have been worth
all the bits in Equestria

17:26.896 --> 17:28.581
if I'd made things
right with Dusty.

17:28.669 --> 17:30.780
I wish I knew why
she won't go back.

17:30.868 --> 17:32.450
Why don't you ask her?

17:32.538 --> 17:34.219
She didn't seem
to want to talk.

17:34.408 --> 17:35.757
You surprised her.

17:35.845 --> 17:37.936
And she probably had something
else on her schedule.

17:38.024 --> 17:42.593
That thing is PACKED. C'mon,
what've you got to lose?

17:42.816 --> 17:45.561
Now that I've messed
up this much. Nothing.

17:45.759 --> 17:48.108
You're right, Spike.
It's worth a try.

17:48.217 --> 17:51.436
Where do you think she
went? Crochet, bingo...

17:52.626 --> 17:55.709
A squishy fruit
foodfight tournament?

17:58.365 --> 17:59.880
Hey, everypony! We come in...

18:01.264 --> 18:02.653
...pieces.

18:08.975 --> 18:12.621
Stop! We just wanna talk to
Dusty Pages for a moment!

18:12.801 --> 18:13.927
Please?

18:14.238 --> 18:16.649
TIME OUT!

18:18.452 --> 18:19.666
Oof!

18:19.753 --> 18:22.093
Next time, you should rent gear!

18:22.181 --> 18:24.062
We're not actually
here for the game.

18:24.150 --> 18:26.239
I was hoping you'd
give me another chance

18:26.327 --> 18:28.226
to talk to you about
the library book.

18:29.530 --> 18:32.538
This really means a
lot to you, doesn't it?

18:32.791 --> 18:35.028
Mm hm. I know I
ruined your life

18:35.116 --> 18:36.950
by not returning
my book on time.

18:37.037 --> 18:39.671
And I will do anything I
can to make it up to you.

18:39.897 --> 18:42.813
Even promise to never take a
book out of the library again,

18:42.901 --> 18:44.067
if that's what it takes.

18:48.025 --> 18:50.905
That is not the
reaction we expected.

18:51.351 --> 18:54.467
Twilight, dear. You've
got it all backwards!

18:54.555 --> 18:56.637
I'm not upset with you.

18:56.773 --> 18:58.116
You're not?

18:58.204 --> 19:01.587
No! If I'm mad at
anypony, it's me.

19:06.930 --> 19:10.899
All those years I spent
hiding away in that library,

19:11.001 --> 19:12.853
trying to be perfect...

19:12.940 --> 19:14.588
When your book never came in,

19:14.675 --> 19:17.858
I felt something exhilarating!

19:18.032 --> 19:19.179
What was it?

19:19.298 --> 19:20.661
Freedom!

19:20.748 --> 19:21.962
From books?

19:22.049 --> 19:23.860
From perfection!

19:23.973 --> 19:26.656
I was too stubborn to know
when to call it quits.

19:26.744 --> 19:29.293
It took your mistake
to make me realize

19:29.381 --> 19:31.930
that I wasn't living
the life I wanted!

19:32.126 --> 19:34.007
You mean you weren't fired?

19:34.094 --> 19:37.360
You left the library
because you wanted to?

19:37.448 --> 19:40.897
Twilight, your late
book was the best thing

19:40.985 --> 19:42.329
that ever happened to me!

19:42.417 --> 19:45.267
Now, I'm not afraid to try
things I might fail at.

19:45.373 --> 19:47.386
In fact, sometimes messing up

19:47.474 --> 19:49.521
teaches me more than
getting it right!

19:49.746 --> 19:51.418
You're sure you don't
want to return it

19:51.506 --> 19:52.786
and get that
perfect record back?

19:53.912 --> 19:55.342
Agh!

19:55.464 --> 19:58.107
Oh, good. It was
a yellow one.

19:58.232 --> 20:00.115
You can still
see the words!

20:00.280 --> 20:01.628
But it'll have a stain!

20:01.716 --> 20:04.398
That doesn't change
the truth inside it.

20:04.493 --> 20:07.609
Wait. Did you even
read that thing?

20:07.861 --> 20:11.732
Actually, er... no.
I guess I didn't.

20:12.866 --> 20:14.615
"PERFECTION."

20:14.868 --> 20:16.920
And the next part...

20:18.262 --> 20:20.693
The Impossible Pursuit.

20:24.111 --> 20:27.240
Oh. That might've been
useful to look at earlier.

20:31.312 --> 20:35.229
Your total late fees come to...

20:35.317 --> 20:37.654
However much it
is, I'll cover it!

20:37.791 --> 20:40.100
Uh, do you have a
monthly payment plan?

20:40.218 --> 20:41.832
...twenty-eight bits.

20:43.063 --> 20:44.011
That's it?

20:44.098 --> 20:47.848
Yeah. Most ponies don't
know it caps at a month.

20:47.935 --> 20:49.383
Probably because
we don't tell them.

20:52.673 --> 20:55.723
Thank you! Your
account is back to normal.

20:55.811 --> 20:57.613
Although we will be taking down

20:57.701 --> 21:00.264
your Best Book Borrower picture.

21:00.352 --> 21:03.095
Um, is that really necessary?

21:03.183 --> 21:05.420
It just seems so permanent.

21:05.508 --> 21:08.033
I mean, I did return
the book, after all.

21:08.121 --> 21:09.503
Ahem.

21:09.590 --> 21:12.672
OK. Letting the perfection go.

21:12.818 --> 21:14.608
You want me to
reshelf this for you?

21:14.695 --> 21:16.553
Nope. It's an old edition.

21:16.641 --> 21:19.592
We've already replaced
it with a new copy.

21:19.867 --> 21:21.740
In that case, can we keep it?

21:21.828 --> 21:24.443
It might be a good
reminder to have around.

21:25.024 --> 21:28.029
You sure? It's got a stain.

21:28.202 --> 21:30.736
That's what makes it perfect.
