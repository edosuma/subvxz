00:09.343 --> 00:11.745
[theme music]

00:55.656 --> 00:58.392
So this is your idea
of stay out of things?

00:58.426 --> 01:01.895
Hey, all I'm doing
is having a nice little

01:01.929 --> 01:04.232
family casual get-together.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.300
I'm not getting involved.

01:06.334 --> 01:07.535
You can't help
yourself, can you?

01:07.568 --> 01:09.470
You're an addict.

01:09.503 --> 01:10.771
Hey, she's my sister.

01:10.804 --> 01:13.241
And I thought it would be
nice to meet her new friend,

01:13.274 --> 01:16.477
like the supportive,
loving person that I am.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.146
Oh-ho, you're nosy, Alice!

01:18.179 --> 01:18.979
Nosy!

01:22.116 --> 01:22.983
You wrestle?

01:23.016 --> 01:23.884
Yeah.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.253
Yeah, 165 pounds!

01:25.286 --> 01:26.787
Wiry and quick.

01:26.820 --> 01:27.988
Oh, you are!

01:28.021 --> 01:29.357
I are what?

01:29.390 --> 01:31.325
Wiry and quick.

01:31.359 --> 01:32.826
What does that mean?

01:32.860 --> 01:33.761
Oh.

01:33.794 --> 01:37.265
Oh, I didn't mean
quick that way.

01:37.298 --> 01:41.635
[chuckle] Aren't they cute?

01:41.669 --> 01:44.638
Well, they can't
help but be cute, Dan.

01:44.672 --> 01:47.175
They're young, and
they're in love,

01:47.208 --> 01:49.977
and they're headed for a ravine.

01:50.010 --> 01:50.878
Now, now.

01:50.911 --> 01:52.213
Be supportive.

01:52.246 --> 01:54.282
I'm trying to be supportive,
but she's making me puke!

01:54.315 --> 01:56.317
She's acting just like
a high-school girl!

01:56.350 --> 01:57.385
Roseanne.

01:57.418 --> 01:59.553
OK, everybody, dinner's ready.

01:59.587 --> 02:01.088
Come and eat, children.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.356
Aw.

02:02.390 --> 02:03.191
Thank you.

02:15.068 --> 02:18.105
Are they doing
that tongue thing?

02:22.610 --> 02:23.544
Uh--

02:23.577 --> 02:24.378
Yeah.

02:31.919 --> 02:34.154
I used to work for
Sherwood Plate Glass.

02:34.188 --> 02:36.790
I worked with Jim Sherwood
on a couple of jobs.

02:36.824 --> 02:37.691
Nice old guy.

02:37.725 --> 02:38.859
He was a sly old guy.

02:38.892 --> 02:40.127
[interposing voices]
JACKIE: What do you think?

02:40.160 --> 02:41.595
[interposing voices]
ROSEANNE: He's OK.

02:41.629 --> 02:43.464
He's OK?

02:43.497 --> 02:46.534
How can you be in the same room
with this man and say he's OK?

02:46.567 --> 02:47.901
I don't know,
because maybe I still

02:47.935 --> 02:51.805
have partial use of my brain.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.106
You've just got to get lucky.

02:53.140 --> 02:54.808
Yeah, and you've
got to do good work.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.478
Gary's company's
known for its good work.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.747
Gary's got a reputation.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.682
Oh, you two have
got a lot in common.

03:14.595 --> 03:18.065
See, Jackie's got a
reputation for being a good cop.

03:18.098 --> 03:19.733
Oh, no.

03:19.767 --> 03:22.270
No, no, I'm just starting
out on the force.

03:22.303 --> 03:25.172
But Gary's got a very
successful business.

03:25.205 --> 03:28.276
Hey, you risk
your life everyday.

03:28.309 --> 03:29.410
Where's the head?

03:29.443 --> 03:30.244
Yonder.

03:37.618 --> 03:40.020
Ahem.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.489
I'm leaving.

03:41.522 --> 03:42.423
Go.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.558
I don't wanna
hear this anyway.

03:44.592 --> 03:45.759
- Hey, wait for Gary!
- Oh, yeah.

03:45.793 --> 03:47.060
Take Gary.

03:47.094 --> 03:49.963
Take Gary where?

03:49.997 --> 03:51.265
Go show him the grounds.

03:51.299 --> 03:53.000
I'll take him out
back, tell him what he's

03:53.033 --> 03:54.302
really getting himself into.

03:54.335 --> 03:55.603
Dan.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.471
Maybe I'll tell him what
a crazy neurotic family this

03:57.505 --> 03:59.072
really is.

03:59.106 --> 04:01.375
Maybe I'll tell him that you've
still got your stuffed animals,

04:01.409 --> 04:03.977
and that when they're
naughty, you get mad at them!

04:07.481 --> 04:08.882
Well, he's my husband.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.985
I have to tell him everything.

04:12.019 --> 04:12.886
Hey, Gar.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.388
You like motorcycles?

04:14.422 --> 04:16.256
Oh, not really.

04:16.290 --> 04:17.658
You like boats?

04:17.691 --> 04:19.059
Nah.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.928
How about a drafty old garage
with a lot of good junk laying

04:20.961 --> 04:22.195
around?

04:22.229 --> 04:23.964
Oh, yeah, sure.

04:23.997 --> 04:24.965
Come on out.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.667
I'll show you my
motorcycle and my boat.

04:26.700 --> 04:30.404
We can stand around
and get the flu,

04:30.438 --> 04:32.973
and you two hens can yak it up.

04:33.006 --> 04:33.941
Yak, yak, yak!

04:41.148 --> 04:42.483
Nice little work
area you got here.

04:42.516 --> 04:43.384
Yeah.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.785
Thanks.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.186
My little escape.

04:46.219 --> 04:48.456
Yeah, I hear you.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.558
You must have been married.

04:50.591 --> 04:53.827
No, not yet.

04:53.861 --> 04:55.629
Jackie tells me that you
and Roseanne been together

04:55.663 --> 04:56.764
since right out of high school.

04:56.797 --> 04:57.665
Yeah.

04:57.698 --> 04:58.866
Hard to believe.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.934
12 years of high school,
and you go out and do

05:00.968 --> 05:02.970
something completely stupid.

05:03.003 --> 05:05.105
Oh, I'm only kidding.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.006
It's really good.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.174
We're really happy.

05:07.207 --> 05:08.275
It's OK, Dan.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.710
I already know that
anything I tell Jackie

05:09.743 --> 05:10.778
goes right back Roseanne.

05:10.811 --> 05:11.712
Bingo.

05:11.745 --> 05:14.548
Hey, being single
is no bargain.

05:14.582 --> 05:17.117
Let me tell you, it's
tough meeting people.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.586
You seem to be doing OK.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.454
Oh, yeah.

05:20.488 --> 05:24.658
Jackie, she's-- she's something.

05:24.692 --> 05:25.959
Jackie's a good kid.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.862
Yeah, I'm nuts about her, man.

05:28.896 --> 05:32.533
You know, it's like I can't
stop thinking about her.

05:32.566 --> 05:33.867
And the truth is, I
don't want to stop

05:33.901 --> 05:35.102
thinking about her,
because you know,

05:35.135 --> 05:37.871
when I'm thinking
about her, I'm happy.

05:37.905 --> 05:41.041
You know, I mean, she's fun.

05:41.074 --> 05:45.145
She's sexy, and she's bright.

05:45.178 --> 05:49.082
She's a little crazy, too, but
you know, that's OK with me,

05:49.116 --> 05:52.386
because I could use a
little craziness in my life.

05:52.420 --> 05:54.722
She can provide that.

05:54.755 --> 05:55.556
Yeah.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.260
I'm in love with her, Dan.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.517
- You told her that yet?
- No way.

06:23.551 --> 06:24.351
Atta-boy.

06:26.587 --> 06:29.156
I mean, he's good,
and he's gentle.

06:29.189 --> 06:30.558
Isn't he gentle?

06:30.591 --> 06:32.292
And I like his look.

06:32.325 --> 06:34.762
You find him
attractive, don't you?

06:34.795 --> 06:36.464
Look, I just want to
say something to you.

06:36.497 --> 06:37.598
And I just want you know.

06:37.631 --> 06:38.999
The only reason I'm
saying it is because I

06:39.032 --> 06:40.167
care about you so much.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.068
What?

06:41.101 --> 06:42.703
You don't like him?
- Sis.

06:42.736 --> 06:43.704
OK, what, what?

06:43.737 --> 06:45.038
Tell me.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.940
You know, I don't want us
to get into a fight over this.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.075
No, we won't get into a fight.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.643
OK, because that's not
why I'm mentioning it.

06:49.677 --> 06:51.512
- Mentioning what?
- What I'm going to mention.

06:51.545 --> 06:53.814
What?

06:53.847 --> 06:55.716
Remember last year,
you and that guy, Tony?

06:58.986 --> 07:01.622
Oh, Roseanne!

07:01.655 --> 07:03.223
Give me a break!

07:03.256 --> 07:04.825
Tony!

07:04.858 --> 07:10.931
Oh, you-- [laughing] This
is nothing like Tony!

07:10.964 --> 07:17.004
With Tony, I was this gushing
little high-school girl.

07:17.037 --> 07:19.106
I was Tony's love slave.

07:19.139 --> 07:21.575
Tony!

07:21.609 --> 07:24.845
Well, not just
with Tony, Sis--

07:24.878 --> 07:27.180
I mean, you know, you've been
this way with a lot of guys.

07:29.983 --> 07:30.851
Yeah.

07:30.884 --> 07:31.752
Well, maybe I have.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.153
But with Gary, it's different.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.922
See, because Gary
and I do things

07:34.955 --> 07:38.425
that I want to do all the time.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.760
Or we will.

07:39.793 --> 07:43.531
We will, as soon as there's
something that I want to do.

07:46.534 --> 07:48.869
You're so full of it.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.638
OK, just drop it.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.405
Oh, now, she doesn't want
to talk about it anymore.

07:52.439 --> 07:53.941
No, I really
don't, because you're

07:53.974 --> 07:54.975
getting completely defensive.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.476
No, I'm not being
defensive, Roseanne.

07:56.510 --> 07:57.611
You're more defensive than I am.

07:57.645 --> 07:58.946
If you have a problem
with my boyfriend,

07:58.979 --> 08:00.948
why don't you just
come out and say so!

08:00.981 --> 08:03.483
Oh, he's not
taking over my life!

08:03.517 --> 08:06.787
What's that supposed to mean?

08:06.820 --> 08:08.388
Just forget about it, OK?

08:08.421 --> 08:09.790
Never mind.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.225
We obviously cannot discuss
this like two adults,

08:12.259 --> 08:14.427
because one of us is a child.

08:14.461 --> 08:16.296
Oh, how am I
acting like a child?

08:16.329 --> 08:18.098
Oh, forget about it.

08:18.131 --> 08:21.068
Oh, she can blame it,
but she can't name it.

08:23.971 --> 08:27.307
I can blame it, but I
can't-- you are 33 years old!

08:27.340 --> 08:28.408
Well, you're 36 years old.

08:28.441 --> 08:29.342
Yeah!

08:29.376 --> 08:31.011
I am 36 years old!
So what of it?

08:31.044 --> 08:32.312
So what of it?
Just forget about it, OK?

08:32.345 --> 08:33.647
No, not OK!

08:33.681 --> 08:36.016
Don't you have a little pep
rally you want to go off to?

08:36.049 --> 08:37.350
(SCREAMING) I
can't believe I bring

08:37.384 --> 08:38.451
him all the way over here--

08:38.485 --> 08:41.321
[interposing voices]

08:55.202 --> 09:01.108
So you want to go
out to dinner tonight?

09:01.141 --> 09:02.275
Sure, if you do.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.510
What do you feel like?

09:03.543 --> 09:04.678
Oh, I'm easy.

09:04.712 --> 09:06.246
What do you feel like?

09:06.279 --> 09:08.081
Lanford Tavern OK?

09:08.115 --> 09:10.417
Um, yeah, that's fine.

09:10.450 --> 09:12.185
No, if you want to go
somewhere else, just name it.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.086
No, LT's fine.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.421
I don't know if we can get in.

09:14.454 --> 09:15.488
Are you kidding me?

09:15.522 --> 09:17.290
Sam's brother works there.

09:17.324 --> 09:18.258
Sam?

09:18.291 --> 09:19.893
Yeah.

09:19.927 --> 09:21.028
Oh, I've got to tell you.

09:21.061 --> 09:24.364
Friday, Sam's backing
up the truck, you know.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.899
I said, you know,
let me get out,

09:25.933 --> 09:27.367
and I'll help guide you back.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.936
So of course, what does Sam say?

09:28.969 --> 09:30.771
- "No problem, got you covered."
- Yeah.

09:30.804 --> 09:31.972
Right.

09:32.005 --> 09:34.642
So he starts backing up,
no idea where he's going.

09:34.675 --> 09:36.309
And he just roars
the thing backwards

09:36.343 --> 09:38.145
without even looking, stops.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.146
I get out.

09:39.179 --> 09:40.814
He's this far from
the loading dock.

09:40.848 --> 09:41.715
I'm telling you.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.717
This guy's got a sixth sense.

09:43.751 --> 09:44.985
You've got to meet him.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.987
We'll go out with him sometime.

09:47.020 --> 09:47.921
Yeah, we might as well.

09:47.955 --> 09:51.224
You talk about him enough.

09:51.258 --> 09:55.763
What if I meet Sam, and all
he does is tell Gary stories?

09:55.796 --> 09:57.798
Well, you'd
probably love those.

09:57.831 --> 09:58.866
Yeah.

09:58.899 --> 10:02.002
You at work with Sam
in the glass truck.

10:02.035 --> 10:04.204
Hey, what's the matter?

10:04.237 --> 10:06.606
Nothing.

10:06.640 --> 10:07.507
Nothing.

10:07.540 --> 10:11.144
I'm just feeling a little tired.

10:11.178 --> 10:12.545
That's all.

10:12.579 --> 10:13.513
Well, no wonder.

10:13.546 --> 10:14.815
You just used up
a lot of energy.

10:14.848 --> 10:15.949
Yeah.

10:15.983 --> 10:21.188
But I was tired before I
used up all that energy.

10:25.358 --> 10:26.960
Well, you should
have said something.

10:26.994 --> 10:28.395
I thought you'd be mad at me.

10:28.428 --> 10:29.863
Mad at you?

10:29.897 --> 10:33.300
No, I'm-- no, but I am
mad at you for making

10:33.333 --> 10:34.501
love with me when
you didn't really

10:34.534 --> 10:35.936
want to make love with me.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.637
See, I knew
you'd be mad at me.

10:37.671 --> 10:42.642
Jackie, all you had
to do was say something.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.311
It's OK.

10:44.344 --> 10:45.679
It's no big deal.

10:45.713 --> 10:47.748
A lot of people don't like to
make love at the same time.

10:51.018 --> 10:51.885
I'm sorry.

10:51.919 --> 10:52.886
I'm sorry.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.688
Jackie, you don't
have to be sorry.

10:54.722 --> 10:55.989
I'm sorry.

10:56.023 --> 10:56.824
Right.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.994
So next time,
you'll just tell me.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.129
Right.
Right.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.030
OK?

11:03.063 --> 11:03.864
OK.

11:07.367 --> 11:08.668
So how about dinner?

11:08.702 --> 11:10.437
You still feel like going out?

11:10.470 --> 11:11.271
Yeah, if you do.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.250
I've had it, Roseanne.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.318
I have really, really had it.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.419
It's true.

11:26.453 --> 11:27.620
You know?

11:27.654 --> 11:29.790
All we ever wind up doing
is what he wants to do.

11:29.823 --> 11:32.459
If we want to go out and
eat, he picks the restaurant.

11:32.492 --> 11:35.896
If we want to watch TV, he
gets to hold the remote.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.164
Do we ever come
over here and just

11:37.197 --> 11:38.465
hang around with you and Dan?

11:38.498 --> 11:39.366
No.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.168
Right.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.904
Well, you know, maybe he's
making all the decisions

11:43.937 --> 11:46.473
because you're sitting
there grinning like an idiot

11:46.506 --> 11:47.775
and letting him make
all the decisions.

11:47.808 --> 11:48.842
Yeah.

11:48.876 --> 11:52.079
But you see, what he
does is, he lets me

11:52.112 --> 11:55.015
let him make all the decisions.

11:55.048 --> 11:58.786
He knows that I don't want
to watch cable sports news.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.888
Well, have you told him that?

12:00.921 --> 12:02.956
No, but he should know.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.925
I shouldn't have
to tell him that.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.060
No, he should be
able to read your mind.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.495
No, but you know--

12:08.528 --> 12:09.696
you know, Roseanne.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.765
He should know me
better than that by now.

12:11.799 --> 12:13.733
I mean, you'd think.

12:13.767 --> 12:16.804
You know, you are really
messing up a good thing here.

12:16.837 --> 12:19.139
I mean, you meet a
guy, a really nice guy,

12:19.172 --> 12:20.140
and you're blowing it.

12:20.173 --> 12:21.308
You mean, you
really do like him?

12:21.341 --> 12:22.375
Jackie!

12:22.409 --> 12:23.710
Well, I'm afraid.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.278
If I tell him all
this stuff about me,

12:25.312 --> 12:27.014
then he won't like me so much.

12:27.047 --> 12:29.850
Because maybe he's one of
those guys who only likes

12:29.883 --> 12:31.584
women that he can control.

12:31.618 --> 12:34.287
Well, now, you would like
to find out about that.

12:34.321 --> 12:35.956
You know, and if it
is true, then you

12:35.989 --> 12:37.891
don't want him around anyway.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.059
I don't?

12:39.092 --> 12:41.028
No.

12:41.061 --> 12:44.097
Jeez, you are-- you
have your own mood,

12:44.131 --> 12:46.333
you have your own thoughts,
you have your own opinions.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.668
You're a three-dimensional
human being here.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.037
He doesn't even know me.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.204
Well, maybe that's
because you've

12:51.238 --> 12:53.306
been acting like Gidget
on an aphrodisiac

12:53.340 --> 12:54.674
for the past three weeks.

12:57.410 --> 13:01.381
It's just, I like him so
much and I want him to like me.

13:01.414 --> 13:04.051
Well, then just give him a
chance to know the real you.

13:04.084 --> 13:07.855
I mean, maybe he'll like
that girl just as much.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.289
I can't take that
chance, Roseanne!

13:16.496 --> 13:17.898
Have you talked to him?

13:17.931 --> 13:20.633
Because you said you were
going to talk to him.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.269
I am being supportive!

13:22.302 --> 13:25.238
Roseanne, stay out of this.

13:25.272 --> 13:26.439
I am staying out of this.

13:29.076 --> 13:32.679
So did you talk to him?

13:32.712 --> 13:35.182
Why do you have to go?

13:35.215 --> 13:36.516
At 11:30?

13:36.549 --> 13:40.820
Don't tell me
Gary's coming over.

13:40.854 --> 13:42.155
If you don't want
him to come over,

13:42.189 --> 13:44.024
then why don't you just call
him up and tell him that you

13:44.057 --> 13:46.994
don't want him to come over?

13:47.027 --> 13:47.895
No, that's stupid.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.897
You're not going
to make him mad.

13:49.930 --> 13:53.100
You're just going to end
up getting mad at yourself.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.734
You know, she wants
to be by herself,

13:54.767 --> 13:57.104
but she's going to let him
come over and spend the night.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.738
Why can't they just, you know?

13:58.771 --> 14:00.107
Then he can split.

14:10.017 --> 14:10.884
Oh, ick!

14:14.922 --> 14:16.456
You'd better talk to him.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.591
I mean, you know, if
you're tired, just go

14:18.625 --> 14:19.893
and tell him that you're tired.

14:19.927 --> 14:20.961
There's nothing wrong with that.

14:20.994 --> 14:24.731
But you'd better-- yeah, OK.

14:24.764 --> 14:27.234
OK, but you'd
better talk to them.

14:27.267 --> 14:28.468
And then, you call
me in the morning.

14:28.501 --> 14:29.469
OK?

14:29.502 --> 14:30.537
Or else, I'll just
pop over and we'll

14:30.570 --> 14:32.339
have breakfast or something.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.540
Yeah.

14:33.573 --> 14:34.441
OK, bye.

14:34.474 --> 14:37.277
Great.

14:37.310 --> 14:40.880
Now, turn off the light.

14:40.914 --> 14:42.882
She is just totally
gone over the sky.

14:42.916 --> 14:45.585
I mean, she's so
infatuated, she does

14:45.618 --> 14:48.555
whatever he tells her to do, and
she never says anything to him.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.057
I mean, she's just
like this puppet,

14:50.090 --> 14:51.591
and he's just, like,
pulling on her strings.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.426
Roseanne, stay out of it.

14:53.460 --> 14:54.995
[sigh] It's awful.

14:55.028 --> 14:58.031
Because you know, if
she doesn't speak up,

14:58.065 --> 15:00.067
she is, like, gonna
blow it with this guy,

15:00.100 --> 15:02.735
and I really can't stand
to see her do that again.

15:02.769 --> 15:06.073
DAN: Please, I beg you.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.140
ROSEANNE: She's my sister.

15:07.174 --> 15:09.943
DAN: Stay out of
Jackie's love life.

15:09.977 --> 15:15.248
ROSEANNE: Well, maybe I
would if I had one of my own.

15:15.282 --> 15:16.683
DAN: All right.

15:16.716 --> 15:17.985
If that's what it takes.

15:22.889 --> 15:25.792
[knocking on door]

15:27.494 --> 15:28.361
JACKIE: Yeah?

15:28.395 --> 15:29.196
GARY: It's me!

15:36.203 --> 15:38.605
Come on, Jackie, let me in!

15:38.638 --> 15:39.706
I got to talk to you.

15:43.743 --> 15:44.677
What's going on?

15:44.711 --> 15:45.578
Nothing.

15:45.612 --> 15:46.679
I'm just sitting around.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.015
That's not what I'm
talking about, Jackie.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.582
What is going on?

15:49.616 --> 15:52.885
I mean, you say it's
OK for me to come over,

15:52.919 --> 15:54.154
and then you call
me back and tell me,

15:54.187 --> 15:55.422
you know, maybe I
shouldn't come over.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.791
And then, you say, no,
really, it's OK, come on over.

15:58.825 --> 16:01.228
I mean, I thought that you
owe me better than that.

16:01.261 --> 16:02.562
I owe you?

16:02.595 --> 16:05.532
Yeah, you owe me!

16:05.565 --> 16:08.035
OK, look, if you've got a
problem with this relationship,

16:08.068 --> 16:10.437
I think at least you
owe me the courtesy

16:10.470 --> 16:11.971
of telling me face-to-face.

16:12.005 --> 16:14.074
You know, just say, look, Gary,
even though you're the greatest

16:14.107 --> 16:16.276
guy I ever met and even though
this is the best relationship

16:16.309 --> 16:19.779
and the best sex I've ever had,
for some unforeseen, ridiculous

16:19.812 --> 16:21.581
reason, I want to break it off.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.650
Oh, so then, you think
that whatever reason

16:23.683 --> 16:26.353
I might have is just ridiculous.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.521
Amazing.

16:28.555 --> 16:31.458
What, of everything that I
just said, that's the one

16:31.491 --> 16:32.692
thing you focus on?

16:32.725 --> 16:34.294
You couldn't have come
back to me with, gee, Gary,

16:34.327 --> 16:35.762
you really think it's
the best relationship?

16:35.795 --> 16:37.364
Or gee, you really
think it's the best sex?

16:37.397 --> 16:39.932
No, because you just implied
that any reason I might have

16:39.966 --> 16:41.101
is going to be
ridiculous anyway.

16:41.134 --> 16:44.171
Jackie, what are we
talking about here?

16:44.204 --> 16:49.142
Look, you've got something
you want to say to me.

16:49.176 --> 16:50.677
I don't think it's ridiculous.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.045
I want to hear it.

16:52.079 --> 16:53.546
Anything you have to
say, I want to hear it.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.115
You know, as a matter of
fact, I'd like to hear

16:55.148 --> 16:57.350
you say something for a change.

16:57.384 --> 17:00.787
I mean, why do I have to
decide everything all the time?

17:00.820 --> 17:03.156
You know, this is
our relationship.

17:03.190 --> 17:04.924
It's not my relationship.

17:04.957 --> 17:06.826
It's our relationship.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.861
You know, help me
fly the damn plane.

17:08.895 --> 17:13.200
See, I knew this would
happen if we slept together.

17:13.233 --> 17:16.303
All this complicated--
all the conversations

17:16.336 --> 17:17.837
and all this arguing.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.206
Jackie, this
isn't complicated.

17:19.239 --> 17:20.940
This is very simple.

17:20.973 --> 17:22.342
I'm in love with you,
and all of a sudden,

17:22.375 --> 17:23.910
you don't want to see me.
Why?

17:23.943 --> 17:24.744
What did I do?

17:30.317 --> 17:31.718
You're in love with me?

17:43.296 --> 17:45.265
[knocking]

17:45.298 --> 17:46.766
Hello?

17:46.799 --> 17:48.268
JACKIE: Hello!

17:48.301 --> 17:50.237
All right, just give me one sec!

17:50.270 --> 17:52.172
Did you talk to Gary?

17:52.205 --> 17:53.273
Yeah!
Yeah.

17:53.306 --> 17:54.507
Hang on a sec!

17:54.541 --> 17:58.077
I can't hear you in here!

17:58.111 --> 18:01.614
You didn't call me
after you left last night.

18:01.648 --> 18:04.284
I'm assuming he came over,
knowing you're such a wimp,

18:04.317 --> 18:06.719
and you probably
didn't tell him what

18:06.753 --> 18:08.855
you said you were gonna say.

18:08.888 --> 18:12.859
I'm not a wimp, Roseanne.

18:12.892 --> 18:14.127
Do you have any coffee?

18:14.161 --> 18:16.296
No.

18:16.329 --> 18:18.198
So, did you talk to him?

18:18.231 --> 18:19.098
Yeah.

18:19.132 --> 18:20.667
I talked to him.

18:20.700 --> 18:21.934
OK?

18:21.968 --> 18:23.403
Hey, you're the one that
was all upset last night.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.304
You know?

18:24.337 --> 18:25.972
Hey, you've got coffee.

18:26.005 --> 18:29.176
You're sitting there like, oh,
I just want to be by myself.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.778
I don't want Gary to come over.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.313
So did you end up
talking to him,

18:33.346 --> 18:36.949
or did you let him come
over, and then talk to him?

18:36.983 --> 18:39.486
You know, Roseanne,
you've got a big mouth.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.124
Oh, I guess I do.

18:45.158 --> 18:47.227
JACKIE: Yeah.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.127
Yeah, you do.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.996
Thanks a lot.

18:50.029 --> 18:51.764
Well, no need to thank me.

18:56.035 --> 18:58.738
Goodbye, Roseanne.

18:58.771 --> 19:02.409
Uh, Gary could you excuse
us for a couple minutes?

19:02.442 --> 19:03.543
I'd like to talk to Jackie.

19:03.576 --> 19:05.345
Gary, just stay
right where you are.

19:05.378 --> 19:09.316
Gary, could you just, like,
go in the bathroom for a minute?

19:09.349 --> 19:10.783
Um, I'll just--

19:10.817 --> 19:17.457
I'll just-- Yeah.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.291
I'll--

19:24.364 --> 19:25.164
Nice butt.

19:31.238 --> 19:32.171
I'm sorry.

19:32.205 --> 19:33.573
I didn't know he
was in the bathroom.

19:33.606 --> 19:34.474
Yes, you did.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.643
No, I didn't.

19:36.676 --> 19:37.910
What difference
would it make anyway?

19:37.944 --> 19:39.612
I mean, you wouldn't have
said nothing to him if I--

19:39.646 --> 19:43.015
If you hadn't
opened your big mouth.

19:43.049 --> 19:44.217
Yeah.

19:44.251 --> 19:46.953
Because I know how much
you really like this guy!

19:46.986 --> 19:48.221
(WHISPERING LOUDLY) Shut up!

19:48.255 --> 19:50.156
Shut up!

19:50.189 --> 19:51.891
What, you didn't
tell him that, either?

19:51.924 --> 19:53.293
What are you trying to do?

19:53.326 --> 19:54.294
I'm just trying to help!

19:54.327 --> 19:55.762
Well, I don't
need your help, OK?

19:55.795 --> 19:56.963
I'm doing OK by myself.

19:56.996 --> 19:58.197
Because you know why?

19:58.231 --> 20:01.033
That man standing in my
bathroom right now loves me.

20:01.067 --> 20:02.269
No, he doesn't love you.

20:02.302 --> 20:05.405
He loves perfect woman,
the woman with no opinions.

20:05.438 --> 20:07.240
Well, perfect woman just
happens to be in this body

20:07.274 --> 20:08.140
right now.

20:08.174 --> 20:09.242
And who knows?

20:09.276 --> 20:11.244
Maybe I can actually
become perfect woman.

20:11.278 --> 20:14.481
I've been putting it off for
four weeks, so what the hell?

20:14.514 --> 20:15.682
It's working out pretty nice.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.049
He loves me, Roseanne.

20:17.083 --> 20:18.918
Why would I want
to mess that up?

20:18.951 --> 20:21.120
Or no, why would you
want me to mess that up?

20:21.153 --> 20:23.122
I don't!

20:23.155 --> 20:24.291
This isn't even you.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.326
I mean, you're losing
yourself in this guy.

20:26.359 --> 20:27.727
(WHISPERING) He
loves me, Roseanne.

20:27.760 --> 20:31.063
And anyway, I'm not
responsible to you anymore.

20:31.097 --> 20:32.399
Hey, I'll call you.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.232
OK?

20:44.911 --> 20:48.214
I want you out of here.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.916
You're gonna kick me
out of your apartment?

20:49.949 --> 20:51.183
Yeah, yeah.

20:51.217 --> 20:52.585
I'm going to kick you
out of my apartment,

20:52.619 --> 20:54.621
and I want you to
butt out of my life.

20:54.654 --> 20:55.522
Come on, Jackie.

20:55.555 --> 20:56.356
Goodbye.

21:01.093 --> 21:01.894
I'm sorry.

21:09.135 --> 21:10.202
Bye.

21:10.236 --> 21:12.639

ME"]

21:21.881 --> 21:35.094
SONG: I hope that he turns out
to be someone to watch over me.

21:38.798 --> 21:45.638
Someone to watch over me.
