00:38.835 --> 00:43.275
Well, Dmitri,
every search for a hero...

00:43.335 --> 00:46.635
must begin with something
that every hero requires--

00:48.275 --> 00:50.215
a villain.

00:50.275 --> 00:55.115
Therefore, in the search
for our hero, Bellerophon,

00:55.185 --> 00:57.745
we created a monster,

00:59.856 --> 01:01.946
Chimera.

01:05.090 --> 01:08.251
I beg you, Dmitri,
come to Sydney...

01:08.321 --> 01:11.261
and accompany me
to Atlanta immediately.

01:11.321 --> 01:14.621
However we travel,
I must arrive at my destination...

01:14.701 --> 01:17.761
within 20 hours of departure.

01:49.332 --> 01:52.262
Folks, we're
two-and-a-half hours from Atlanta.

01:52.332 --> 01:55.862
Look out your window now. We have
a great view of the Rocky Mountains.

01:55.942 --> 02:01.142
You keep staring at that watch as if
your life depended on it, Doctor.

02:01.212 --> 02:03.142
Oh, yes.

02:03.212 --> 02:05.612
I suppose I'm a bit anxious.

02:05.682 --> 02:08.172
You'll soon be with old friends.

02:08.252 --> 02:10.882
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.

02:10.952 --> 02:14.792
I'm sorry it couldn't be
under happier circumstances.

02:14.862 --> 02:19.322
I'm sorry too.
You are sorry, and I am sorry.

02:23.303 --> 02:26.133
You don't know Gradski
thought the world of you.

02:26.203 --> 02:29.503
Did he... know...

02:29.573 --> 02:32.233
before the end
that you two had succeeded?

02:32.313 --> 02:35.143
Yes, he knew. Just--

02:35.213 --> 02:37.903
Not in time to save him.

02:37.983 --> 02:40.573
No.

02:40.653 --> 02:45.583
After you've been infected with Chimera
for 20 hours, nothing can save you.

02:45.653 --> 02:49.453
Not even Bellerophon.

02:49.523 --> 02:53.653
You can carry them
together... safely?

02:53.733 --> 02:55.663
Yes.

02:55.733 --> 03:00.934
And you'll get us to safe place
with them in Atlanta, thank God.

03:01.004 --> 03:04.844
This is your captain again.
We've experienced a slight...

03:04.914 --> 03:07.034
but abrupt drop in cabin pressure.

03:07.114 --> 03:10.444
As a precaution,
I've released the oxygen masks.

03:10.514 --> 03:12.944
Please put them on and sit back, relax.

03:13.014 --> 03:15.214
There's nothing
to worry about.

03:17.084 --> 03:19.384
Are you concerned?

03:19.454 --> 03:21.394
Not so far.

03:21.454 --> 03:25.324
Just put on your oxygen mask.
I'll see what's going on.

03:25.394 --> 03:28.094
Okay.

03:33.004 --> 03:37.274
Denver Center,
this is Trans-Pac 2207, 747 heavy.

03:37.344 --> 03:40.404
We're unable to maintain
cabin pressurization.

03:40.474 --> 03:43.605
We've initiated a descent
to one six thousand.

03:43.685 --> 03:45.775
Captain--

04:26.956 --> 04:29.896
It seems we have
a problem, Dmitri.

04:29.966 --> 04:35.056
You keep calling me Dmitri.
You really shouldn't.

04:35.136 --> 04:37.656
You are not Dmitri?

04:50.516 --> 04:51.986
No.

04:54.456 --> 04:57.586
Wallis, hold on to this.

05:08.097 --> 05:11.227
Ulrich, remember to pull the--

05:13.577 --> 05:16.107
Remember to pull
the NO2 tank and dump it.

05:16.247 --> 05:18.367
All done, chief.

05:21.377 --> 05:25.817
Terrain. Terrain.
Pull up. Pull up.

05:25.887 --> 05:27.817
Terrain.

05:31.027 --> 05:34.657
Okay, dive, dive!
Checkpoint Charlie in three,

05:34.727 --> 05:36.717
two, one, go!

05:44.208 --> 05:47.898
Terrain. Terrain.
Pull up. Pull up.

05:47.978 --> 05:52.608
Terrain. Terrain.
Pull up. Pull up.

05:52.678 --> 05:57.048
- Terrain. Terrain. Pull up. Pull up.

09:17.453 --> 09:19.393
Good morning, Mr. Hunt.

09:19.453 --> 09:21.393
Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,

09:21.463 --> 09:25.123
involves the recovery of
a stolen item designated ''Chimera. ''

09:25.193 --> 09:27.633
You may select any two team members,

09:27.703 --> 09:31.003
but it is essential that the third
team member be Nyah Nordoff-Hall.

09:31.073 --> 09:35.503
She is a civilian and
a highly capable professional thief.

09:35.573 --> 09:38.373
You have 48 hours
to recruit Miss Nordoff-Hall...

09:38.443 --> 09:41.313
and meet me in Seville
to receive your assignment.

09:41.383 --> 09:45.184
As always, should you or any member
of your IMF team be caught or killed,

09:45.254 --> 09:48.184
the secretary will disavow
all knowledge of your actions.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.284
And, Mr. Hunt,
the next time you go on holiday,

09:51.354 --> 09:54.324
please be good enough to let us know
where you're going.

09:54.394 --> 09:57.764
This message
will self-destruct in five seconds.

09:57.834 --> 10:00.594
If I let you know where I'm going...

10:00.664 --> 10:03.264
then I won't be on holiday.

13:38.079 --> 13:40.009
I see you found it.

13:42.079 --> 13:44.139
What are you doing here?

13:44.219 --> 13:46.850
Think you're the only one
who can pick a lock?

13:48.120 --> 13:51.680
Huh. You're not just
a pretty face after all.

14:09.740 --> 14:12.140
Do you mind if I'm on top?

14:12.210 --> 14:15.480
No. Either way works for me.

14:39.111 --> 14:42.171
- You'll never find it there.
- Damn it!

14:43.881 --> 14:45.711
Find what?

14:45.781 --> 14:49.221
His ex's Bulgari necklace
that goes up for auction on Tuesday.

14:54.121 --> 14:56.421
And are you gonna tell me
where it is?

14:59.591 --> 15:01.531
Far left.

15:12.272 --> 15:14.872
This is very disconcerting.

15:14.942 --> 15:18.502
Hey, you put me here.
I just do as I'm told.

15:19.952 --> 15:22.682
Right.

15:38.632 --> 15:40.572
Hmm!

15:47.042 --> 15:52.273
Now, who are you,
and what's it gonna cost me?

15:52.353 --> 15:55.613
- I wouldn't do that.
- What?

15:55.683 --> 15:58.123
That.

16:04.393 --> 16:07.833
No, no, no.
Tranquilo. Tranquilo.

16:07.893 --> 16:10.023
Mr. Keys, it is you.

16:10.103 --> 16:13.293
It is Mr. Keys,
our security engineer. Apologize!

16:13.373 --> 16:15.833
No, no.
No need to apologize.

16:15.903 --> 16:19.303
Now, Miss Hall, my associate has
your necklace in a very safe place.

16:19.373 --> 16:23.783
But obviously we do feel the alarm
should have gone off a little sooner.

16:23.843 --> 16:26.783
- Isn't that right, Miss Hall?
- Hmm? Oh, absolutely.

16:26.853 --> 16:29.844
Much, much too long, I'd say.

16:31.384 --> 16:33.784
Under the circumstances,
I think we'd recommend...

16:33.854 --> 16:35.884
resetting the sensors
to respond to a lighter load.

16:35.964 --> 16:39.084
How do you feel
about 40 kilos, Miss Hall?

16:39.164 --> 16:42.034
Perfect.

16:42.104 --> 16:44.364
Shall we?

16:47.374 --> 16:49.734
- Miss Hall.
- Hmm?

16:49.804 --> 16:52.704
Haven't you forgotten something?

16:57.284 --> 17:00.014
What are you trying to do, señorita?
Rob me?

17:00.084 --> 17:03.384
The thought had crossed my mind.

17:04.454 --> 17:08.114
I'm missing something here, aside
from my half-million-pound necklace.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.855
Even after I screwed up the job,

17:09.925 --> 17:11.984
I could've walked out of there
with the bloody thing.

17:12.065 --> 17:13.555
At least you walked.

17:13.635 --> 17:15.625
Why did you watch me
go through it all?

17:15.704 --> 17:18.935
I wanted to see how good you were.
I was hoping we might work together.

17:19.005 --> 17:22.595
Sounds terrific.
Muchacho.

17:24.275 --> 17:27.005
Now be serious.
Whatever you're talking about,

17:27.075 --> 17:29.375
you couldn't possibly want me
after tonight's performance.

17:29.445 --> 17:31.935
- You didn't do that badly.
- You apologizing for me?

17:32.015 --> 17:35.175
Quite the gentleman.
Gracias.

17:35.255 --> 17:38.845
Not really.
I triggered the alarm.

17:41.625 --> 17:43.685
Sorry.

17:48.536 --> 17:52.906
I don't do laundry, cook,
or put up with cheeky bastards

17:52.976 --> 17:57.036
who set me up on their territory
so they can poach on mine.

18:20.316 --> 18:22.256
Hola.

18:22.316 --> 18:25.776
Hi.
Would you mind slowing down?

18:27.726 --> 18:31.387
Where did you get this number?
I don't even have it.

18:32.867 --> 18:35.227
Would you like it?

18:51.987 --> 18:55.277
Pull over and listen to me,
will you? Just listen.

18:55.357 --> 18:59.087
- Listen to what?
- I need your help.

18:59.157 --> 19:01.957
- And I think you could use mine.
- Your help?

19:02.027 --> 19:05.467
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about Scotland Yard,

19:05.527 --> 19:09.057
Interpol, every Dutch authority.

19:09.137 --> 19:13.468
- I can make them all go away.
- Oh, bloody hell.

19:13.538 --> 19:16.098
You're a spy!
Well, if you want me,

19:16.178 --> 19:18.798
you've gotta catch me!

19:20.178 --> 19:22.268
Whoa!

19:39.498 --> 19:41.658
You having fun?

19:53.949 --> 19:55.539
Sorry.

20:00.389 --> 20:03.289
Idiota.

20:03.359 --> 20:05.849
Sorry.

20:05.929 --> 20:08.519
Watch the road.
Watch the road.

21:12.161 --> 21:14.491
What's your name?

21:14.561 --> 21:17.091
Ethan Hunt.

21:17.161 --> 21:20.101
Well, Ethan Hunt,

21:20.171 --> 21:23.141
what is it you want
to talk to me about?

21:25.071 --> 21:29.101
A lot more than I thought.

21:29.181 --> 21:33.271
Awfully short notice.

21:33.351 --> 21:36.211
Care to wait a decent interval?

21:36.281 --> 21:38.811
Who wants to be decent?

22:35.413 --> 22:37.503
So what have you got
against spies?

22:37.583 --> 22:40.983
When they've got
your recruiting technique?

22:43.753 --> 22:45.813
This wasn't exactly by the book.

22:45.893 --> 22:47.983
They've got a book for this?

22:48.063 --> 22:50.463
Oh, they've got
a book for everything.

22:50.523 --> 22:54.023
So, this thing
these blokes pinched--

22:54.093 --> 22:56.533
I don't know
that they pinched it.

22:56.603 --> 22:58.763
I don't even know
that they're blokes.

23:01.603 --> 23:04.133
What am I doing here?

23:04.203 --> 23:06.373
And I thought I'm supposed to be...

23:06.443 --> 23:09.503
some kind of thief
to catch a thief.

23:09.583 --> 23:13.574
So do I... sort of.

23:21.694 --> 23:24.214
Damn, you're beautiful.

24:37.856 --> 24:39.916
Espresso? Cappuccino?

24:39.996 --> 24:43.226
- No, thanks.
- Sit down. Sit down.

24:43.296 --> 24:46.286
Festival's a pain in the ass.

24:46.366 --> 24:49.336
Honoring their saints
by setting them on fire.

24:49.406 --> 24:52.566
Lets you know what they think
of saints, doesn't it?

24:52.636 --> 24:55.406
Damn near set me on fire
on my way over here.

24:55.476 --> 24:58.776
Sorry I barged in
on your vacation.

24:58.846 --> 25:00.576
I'm sorry I didn't
let you know where I was.

25:00.646 --> 25:02.846
Don't be. It wouldn't
be a vacation if you did.

25:02.916 --> 25:05.316
You're sorry, and I'm sorry.

25:05.386 --> 25:09.086
Why did you phrase it like that?

25:09.156 --> 25:12.957
- Like what?
- ''You're sorry; I'm sorry.''

25:13.027 --> 25:16.257
You've gotta be kidding.

25:23.837 --> 25:27.777
Well, Dmitri,
once again I need your help.

25:27.847 --> 25:30.777
Just as in the old days, huh?

25:30.847 --> 25:34.247
When you saved our lives,
saved our very sanity.

25:36.087 --> 25:38.107
Dmitri...

25:38.187 --> 25:41.917
we have this little problem.

25:41.987 --> 25:45.387
Every search for a hero...

25:45.457 --> 25:48.827
must begin with something
that every hero requires--

25:48.897 --> 25:51.057
a villain.

25:51.137 --> 25:55.898
Therefore, in the search
for our hero, Bellerophon,

25:55.968 --> 26:00.378
we created a monster, Chimera.

26:00.438 --> 26:03.408
I beg you, Dmitri,

26:03.478 --> 26:07.008
come to Sydney and accompany me
to Atlanta immediately.

26:08.518 --> 26:11.918
However we travel,
I must arrive at my destination...

26:11.988 --> 26:15.118
within 20 hours of departure.

26:15.188 --> 26:20.388
I fear I can entrust this
to no one but you.

26:20.458 --> 26:26.228
Dmitri, as we say,
I'm sorry and you're sorry.

26:26.298 --> 26:28.738
Do you have any idea
what the hell he's talking about?

26:28.808 --> 26:31.568
- An idea? Yeah.
- Like?

26:31.638 --> 26:34.009
Like it's a good idea
to pick him up in a hurry...

26:34.079 --> 26:36.909
and a bad idea to fly him
on a commercial carrier.

26:36.979 --> 26:40.679
-Is he still in Sydney?
-Dr. Vladimir Nekhovich is dead.

26:42.789 --> 26:45.689
So is his colleague Gradski,
but that happened earlier.

26:45.759 --> 26:51.129
We had Nekhovich on a flight from
Sydney that crashed in the Rockies.

26:51.199 --> 26:54.389
- Dead?
- Are you listening to me?

26:56.199 --> 26:59.169
If he didn't want
to go anywhere without me,

26:59.239 --> 27:01.729
how did you get him
on that flight?

27:01.809 --> 27:03.709
Oh, you were there.

27:11.979 --> 27:14.450
When I couldn't find you,
I had to replace you.

27:14.520 --> 27:16.610
Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice.

27:16.690 --> 27:19.710
Now, he doubled you, what,
two or three times?

27:21.090 --> 27:24.220
- Twice.
- What did you think of him?

27:27.230 --> 27:29.760
We had our reservations
about each other.

27:29.830 --> 27:32.430
Isn't it a little late
to be asking me that?

27:32.500 --> 27:35.870
No, not necessarily.
Airline records...

27:35.940 --> 27:40.070
list a Captain Harold Macintosh
as the pilot of flight 2207.

27:40.140 --> 27:43.810
As far as the media and all
government agencies are concerned,

27:43.880 --> 27:46.040
Captain Macintosh
died on the flight.

27:46.120 --> 27:48.280
But, in fact, he missed it.

27:48.350 --> 27:52.450
He did, however,
make the next flight...

27:52.520 --> 27:54.461
in cargo.

27:54.531 --> 27:58.121
Stuffed into a rather small
suitcase, considering his size.

27:58.201 --> 28:01.631
Now, someone on that flight
planned an operation...

28:01.701 --> 28:04.571
designed to bring the plane down
and make it look like an accident.

28:04.641 --> 28:08.471
Someone skillful enough to bring
the whole thing off without a hitch.

28:08.541 --> 28:11.531
So there's one thing we know
that Ambrose doesn't.

28:11.611 --> 28:15.141
You do think it was Ambrose?
You're not surprised?

28:15.211 --> 28:19.081
Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless
he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.

28:19.151 --> 28:24.751
The question is why? What was this,
uh, Chimera, Nekhovich was carrying?

28:24.821 --> 28:27.591
Only Ambrose knows that.

28:27.661 --> 28:33.461
In any case, you must recover this--
whatever-- Chimera, and bring it to us.

28:33.531 --> 28:37.662
In order to do that, I have to figure
out how he plans to make money with it.

28:37.742 --> 28:40.502
That is where Miss Hall comes in.

28:44.172 --> 28:46.112
Excuse me?

28:46.182 --> 28:48.172
Miss Hall and Ambrose
had a relationship...

28:48.252 --> 28:50.082
which he took very seriously.

28:50.152 --> 28:52.952
She walked away, and he's been
wanting her back ever since.

28:53.022 --> 28:56.112
We believe she's our surest
and quickest way of locating him.

28:56.192 --> 28:58.182
And then what?

28:58.262 --> 29:00.952
Well, make sure
she continues to see him,

29:01.022 --> 29:03.652
gets him to confide in her,
and report to you.

29:18.483 --> 29:22.973
You made it sound as if I was recruiting
her for her skills as a thief.

29:23.053 --> 29:27.183
Well, then I misled you,
or you made the wrong assumption.

29:27.253 --> 29:31.193
Either way, we're asking her
to resume a prior relationship,

29:31.263 --> 29:33.493
not do anything
she hasn't already done.

29:33.563 --> 29:36.083
Voluntarily, I might add.

29:38.163 --> 29:41.263
No, she's got no training
for this kind of thing.

29:41.333 --> 29:44.273
What, to go to bed with a man
and lie to him? She's a woman.

29:44.333 --> 29:47.333
She's got all
the training she needs.

29:51.843 --> 29:54.073
I don't think
I can get her to do it.

29:54.143 --> 29:57.554
- You mean it'll be difficult.
- Very.

29:57.614 --> 30:00.814
Well, this is not Mission Difficult,
Mr. Hunt, it's Mission Impossible.

30:00.884 --> 30:03.614
Difficult should be
a walk in the park for you.

30:03.694 --> 30:05.214
I'm open to suggestion.

30:05.294 --> 30:08.124
If you can think of a quicker way,
you're welcome to try.

30:08.194 --> 30:10.184
You might take a look at these...

30:10.264 --> 30:13.134
if you have any further qualms
about getting her to do the job.

31:10.065 --> 31:14.505
How many people are capable
of something like that?

31:18.176 --> 31:21.006
Sean Ambrose, for one.

31:27.986 --> 31:29.916
Right.

31:39.896 --> 31:43.386
This wasn't what
I had in mind, Nyah.

31:46.536 --> 31:49.626
But it is what you'd
like me to do.

31:53.546 --> 31:57.447
What? Oh, let my conscience
be my guide, is that it?

31:57.517 --> 31:58.677
Something like that.

31:58.747 --> 32:00.877
I don't have a conscience.
I'm a bloody thief.

32:05.327 --> 32:07.617
Are you gonna try
and force me to do this?

32:07.687 --> 32:10.127
Generally, I don't favor
coercing someone,

32:10.197 --> 32:13.827
not when there's a chance
my life could end up in their hands.

32:13.897 --> 32:17.097
- Is that the only reason?
- Can you think of a better one?

32:17.167 --> 32:19.827
Me? No.
But I was just hoping that you might,

32:19.907 --> 32:23.137
thinking that somewhere, this got
personal as well as physical!

32:23.207 --> 32:26.337
Would it make you feel any better
if I didn't want you to do this?

32:26.407 --> 32:28.847
- Yeah, much.
- Then feel better!

33:06.488 --> 33:09.318
You know, Sean will never
be anything but suspicious...

33:09.388 --> 33:12.718
if I pitch up saying,
''Hey, honey, I'm home. ''

33:12.788 --> 33:15.188
What wouldn't
make him suspicious?

33:15.258 --> 33:17.919
That I needed him
in some urgent way.

33:19.869 --> 33:23.099
Destitute.
In serious trouble.

33:23.169 --> 33:25.359
The kind I couldn't possibly
sort out myself.

33:27.069 --> 33:32.599
Serious trouble, Nyah, is something
that I can always arrange.

33:35.679 --> 33:39.449
This transponder chip
is completely untraceable.

33:41.819 --> 33:43.979
It transmits your location
to a satellite...

33:44.059 --> 33:47.149
which can be read
by only this computer.

33:47.229 --> 33:49.659
We can then track you
to within three feet.

33:49.729 --> 33:51.659
Anywhere.

33:53.869 --> 33:56.629
Since your arrest, I've
been sending news bulletins...

33:56.699 --> 33:58.570
to every law enforcement agency.

33:58.640 --> 34:01.470
I know Sean Ambrose,

34:01.540 --> 34:04.440
and I guarantee
that after that airline crash,

34:04.510 --> 34:06.670
he's monitoring
everyone of them.

34:06.750 --> 34:09.150
He knows you're there.

34:10.650 --> 34:13.120
And he has the means
to get you out.

34:15.620 --> 34:17.560
Nyah...

34:20.260 --> 34:22.190
Nyah...

34:22.260 --> 34:24.199
I'm not gonna lose you.

35:23.662 --> 35:26.892
Ethan Hunt? G'day, mate.
I'm William Baird. Billy's okay.

35:26.962 --> 35:29.552
Anything you need me to get,
move or watch, just let me know.

35:29.632 --> 35:31.932
I'll have a look around.

35:35.842 --> 35:38.302
- Shit.
- Yes, it is.

35:40.412 --> 35:42.532
This ain't funny.

35:42.612 --> 35:45.872
I just bought
these $800 Gucci shoes,

35:45.952 --> 35:48.072
and you got me in a helicopter
with this man?

36:23.653 --> 36:26.123
Computer's up. We got her.

36:26.193 --> 36:28.653
Let's put in the coordinates
and get a visual.

36:55.444 --> 36:57.534
Visuals aren't coming up.

36:57.614 --> 37:00.544
The satellite doesn't work
as fast as I do.

37:00.614 --> 37:03.984
Yeah, I heard about you, Luther.
Just wanna say it's an honor...

37:04.054 --> 37:07.484
and a pleasure
to be working with you blokes.

37:10.524 --> 37:14.254
Come on. Isn't there any way
we can speed this up?

37:14.324 --> 37:17.264
With what? This is
the only computer that'll do this.

37:17.334 --> 37:19.965
Ohhh!

38:14.526 --> 38:17.456
Ethan, here we go.

38:25.236 --> 38:27.496
Aye.

38:27.566 --> 38:31.506
Now, there's a bloke who knows
how to give a proper welcome.

38:33.246 --> 38:36.676
Don't get me wrong, mate.
You were very friendly also.

38:38.486 --> 38:40.677
- Is it him?
- It's him, Billy.

38:40.747 --> 38:43.417
- So we've got him!
- We don't know what we've got.

38:43.487 --> 38:45.857
'Cause we don't know what he's got,

38:45.927 --> 38:50.157
where he's got it or
what he's doing in Sydney with it.

38:56.397 --> 39:00.337
- Not much luggage.
- I left in a bit of a hurry.

39:00.407 --> 39:02.527
I'm incredibly grateful, Sean.

39:02.607 --> 39:06.337
How in the world did you find me?

39:07.807 --> 39:09.747
How I usually find you, Nyah.

39:11.247 --> 39:13.187
Magic.

39:27.798 --> 39:33.238
Mmm, mmm!
No flies on her.

39:33.308 --> 39:36.938
No bugs, either.
No transmissions.

39:37.008 --> 39:38.938
She's clean.

39:39.008 --> 39:41.308
All cats are.

39:47.948 --> 39:50.718
- Your room?
- Mmm.

39:53.628 --> 39:58.218
- And my room?
- Hmm.

40:12.249 --> 40:16.879
She did it.
She's in the compound.

40:16.949 --> 40:23.649
Yeah? We just rolled up
a snowball and tossed it into hell.

40:23.719 --> 40:27.389
Now we'll see
what chance it has.

40:27.459 --> 40:29.619
Try it on.

40:33.469 --> 40:35.399
Go ahead.

40:41.680 --> 40:44.200
I'm dying to see
if I remembered your size.

41:14.470 --> 41:17.530
You're not interested
in seeing how it looks?

41:17.610 --> 41:19.550
Oh, I am.

41:22.781 --> 41:24.721
Later.

41:47.841 --> 41:50.401
Every search for a hero...

41:50.481 --> 41:53.451
must begin with something
that every hero requires--

41:53.511 --> 41:55.571
a villain.

41:55.651 --> 42:00.051
Therefore, in the search
for our hero, Bellerophon,

42:00.121 --> 42:03.892
we created a monster, Chimera.

42:03.962 --> 42:06.932
Nekhovich was
a molecular biologist.

42:06.992 --> 42:09.192
Why is he going on
about an old Greek myth?

42:09.262 --> 42:13.532
Nekhovich specialized
in recombining DNA molecules.

42:14.832 --> 42:16.772
In the myth,

42:16.842 --> 42:20.502
Bellerophon was a prince
who killed the Chimera.

42:20.572 --> 42:24.142
A monster with the head of a lion...

42:24.212 --> 42:27.082
and the tail of a serpent...

42:27.152 --> 42:30.482
who plagued the ancient world.

42:30.552 --> 42:33.382
I think Nekhovich created
a monster virus named Chimera...

42:33.452 --> 42:36.482
and the antivirus to kill it,

42:36.562 --> 42:38.392
named Bellerophon.

42:38.462 --> 42:41.262
That simple, huh?

42:43.663 --> 42:45.893
Why not?

43:02.733 --> 43:06.023
£37 million.

43:06.103 --> 43:10.563
Now, that's a promising bid
for Nekhovich's work.

43:12.103 --> 43:15.433
Don't look so worried, Hugh.
We're halfway there.

43:18.883 --> 43:21.903
We'll need this at the track...

43:21.983 --> 43:25.244
if we're gonna get the other half.

43:34.724 --> 43:38.684
Well, then... sorted.

43:45.674 --> 43:48.834
Not everything.

43:48.914 --> 43:51.344
Why do you think
she's really here?

43:53.944 --> 43:56.384
From her point of view or mine?

43:56.454 --> 43:59.714
Well, she wasn't
exactly gagging for it...

43:59.784 --> 44:02.654
when she left you six months ago.

44:04.195 --> 44:07.215
The question is,
do you trust her?

44:14.935 --> 44:16.995
One considers her timing, of course.

44:17.075 --> 44:20.665
Getting nicked within a week
of the plane going down.

44:20.745 --> 44:25.405
Suggestive,
even borderline suspicious,

44:25.475 --> 44:28.245
but hardly conclusive.

44:33.425 --> 44:35.715
Well, you've thought about it,
at any rate.

44:41.465 --> 44:44.096
Tell me, Hugh,

44:44.166 --> 44:47.696
you don't exactly hang on Nyah's
every word and gesture, do you?

44:51.506 --> 44:53.836
That's a fairly ratty nail that.

44:58.516 --> 45:00.746
Sean, please!

45:00.816 --> 45:06.376
Suppose she is some sort of Trojan
horse sent in by IMF to spy on us.

45:06.456 --> 45:08.856
Why should I deny myself
the pleasure of a ride or two?

45:11.696 --> 45:15.386
Or don't you think I can learn
more from her than she can from me?

45:15.466 --> 45:17.936
I do! I do! I do! I do!

45:17.996 --> 45:20.796
Now, Hugh,

45:20.866 --> 45:24.036
you must realize
that some of us...

45:24.106 --> 45:26.337
have the burden
of sex to deal with.

45:26.407 --> 45:30.247
And I may or may not know
why she thinks she's here,

45:30.317 --> 45:34.877
but I'm willing to take
the risk, because, Hugh,

45:34.947 --> 45:38.387
I am gagging for it.

46:00.207 --> 46:01.977
Come on!

46:04.417 --> 46:08.248
Darling! You won!

46:08.318 --> 46:12.478
- I suppose I did.
- What made you pick that nag?

46:12.558 --> 46:14.688
He's never won a bloody thing.

46:14.758 --> 46:18.128
- ''Thief in the Night.''
- Say no more.

46:18.198 --> 46:21.288
I'm, uh--

46:21.368 --> 46:25.058
I'm off to grab a drink.
Do you still favor the Bellinis?

46:25.138 --> 46:26.698
Mmm.

46:42.958 --> 46:45.319
''Naturally Vain.''

46:45.389 --> 46:47.379
Pardon me?

46:47.459 --> 46:51.789
Naturally Vain... in the fourth.

46:51.859 --> 46:55.229
Check her out. She's due.

47:08.079 --> 47:11.639
You can speak
as if I'm right by your side.

47:11.719 --> 47:13.649
Where are you?

47:13.719 --> 47:16.309
Mounting enclosure
just off the track, 2:00.

47:30.240 --> 47:32.830
How's it going?

47:32.910 --> 47:35.740
Just like old times.

47:35.810 --> 47:38.440
Just like old times?

47:38.510 --> 47:41.540
Just about.

47:44.280 --> 47:47.380
Tell me who you've run into
at Ambrose's.

47:47.450 --> 47:51.360
Near as I can tell, there's about a half
dozen other blokes about the place.

47:51.420 --> 47:55.790
Maybe more.
Hugh Stamp, old friend of Sean's.

47:55.860 --> 47:59.090
He's the only one I recognize.
And a bit of a creep and then some.

47:59.170 --> 48:02.530
We know him. He's over your left
shoulder, looking at you right now.

48:04.200 --> 48:07.901
Ambrose has photos of newspapers
with money piled on them.

48:07.971 --> 48:10.871
Thirty seven million
on the London Times.

48:10.941 --> 48:14.241
What's that about?

48:14.311 --> 48:16.801
Bids from possible Chimera buyers.

48:27.461 --> 48:30.521
Ambrose is meeting
some bloke in the bar.

48:30.601 --> 48:34.791
Big bloke. Ginger hair.
They're into something.

48:40.971 --> 48:43.461
- Who is this guy?
- Checking now, Ethan.

48:51.052 --> 48:54.852
John McCloy,
CEO Biocyte Pharmaceuticals.

48:54.922 --> 48:57.752
In 1989, acquired Biocyte
in a hostile takeover.

48:59.792 --> 49:02.452
He was Nekhovich's boss.

49:02.532 --> 49:05.962
Right. He worked for him
as a research scientist at Biocyte.

49:06.032 --> 49:09.992
Ambrose is showing something
to McCloy on a digital camera.

49:10.072 --> 49:14.272
Whatever McCloy's
looking at, he's not happy about it.

49:24.622 --> 49:26.212
Ambrose just pulled...

49:26.292 --> 49:28.283
the camera's memory card
and put it into an envelope.

49:30.363 --> 49:33.053
Put it in his inner left
jacket pocket.

49:33.133 --> 49:36.563
Confirm left jacket pocket.

49:36.633 --> 49:39.223
Roger that.

49:41.103 --> 49:44.473
Nyah. Nyah, Ambrose
is on his way back to you.

49:44.543 --> 49:47.203
- There's an envelope inside--
- His left jacket pocket.

49:47.273 --> 49:49.873
That's right.

49:49.943 --> 49:53.403
- Where do I meet you?
- Betting table 12, off the paddock.

49:53.483 --> 49:57.143
- Are you sure you're up to this?
- I'll muddle through.

49:58.653 --> 50:00.883
- There you are!
- See anything you like?

50:00.953 --> 50:04.483
Well, yeah.
''Naturally Vain.''

50:04.563 --> 50:07.184
But they're about to close
the betting, and I haven't a bean.

50:07.264 --> 50:10.164
- Nyah!
- Would you mind terribly?

50:10.234 --> 50:14.104
Not at all.
But, um, you are gonna pay for it.

50:14.174 --> 50:18.074
- And with interest.
- I have no doubt.

50:20.014 --> 50:22.474
Hold on.

50:35.194 --> 50:37.954
Put down a thousand for me.

50:41.294 --> 50:43.394
- To win?
- What else?

50:47.275 --> 50:48.455
-Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
-No worries, mate.

50:48.455 --> 50:50.925
-Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
-No worries, mate.

50:50.985 --> 50:53.685
Luther, digital camera
ready to transmit.

50:53.755 --> 50:55.695
Betting table 12.

51:10.175 --> 51:12.105
- There you go.
- Fine.

51:12.175 --> 51:15.775
Oh, sorry about that, mate.

51:18.315 --> 51:21.515
Say again?

51:21.585 --> 51:24.855
Whatever you're about,
in future, watch your step.

51:24.925 --> 51:27.586
Never know who you might run into.

51:27.656 --> 51:31.286
So where's the loo?

51:31.366 --> 51:35.736
Thanks, mate.

51:56.856 --> 51:58.916
How'd you do?

51:58.996 --> 52:01.556
Don't turn around.

52:01.626 --> 52:03.686
I managed.

52:09.237 --> 52:11.227
You turned around.

52:11.307 --> 52:14.607
What are you gonna do?
Spank me?

52:38.697 --> 52:41.597
I'm booted up.
Go, Ethan.

52:48.177 --> 52:50.648
Are you getting this?

53:01.388 --> 53:04.548
''Sergei Gradski.:

53:04.628 --> 53:07.528
20 hours after exposure. ''

53:46.099 --> 53:47.399
God.

53:55.009 --> 53:57.709
Stamp 's out of the loo.

53:57.779 --> 54:00.719
He's coming out of the tunnel,
heading your way, mate.

54:00.779 --> 54:03.409
- I want you out of Ambrose's place.
- What are you talking about?

54:03.489 --> 54:06.889
What's happened?
What did you see?

54:09.930 --> 54:12.050
Okay, he's coming up
behind you, Ethan.

54:12.130 --> 54:15.860
You've done your job.
I want you out of Australia.

54:15.930 --> 54:18.260
- Thirty steps.
- How do you suggest I go about it?

54:18.340 --> 54:21.700
He's touched your heart.
You need to think it over.

54:21.770 --> 54:24.260
Fifteen, fourteen, twelve, eleven.

54:24.340 --> 54:27.330
I want you out of there now.
Give me the earpiece.

54:27.410 --> 54:30.210
- Nine, Ethan. Eight.
- If you don't get out of there,

54:30.280 --> 54:33.080
I'm coming in and getting you out.

54:33.150 --> 54:36.020
Ethan, get out of there!

54:36.090 --> 54:39.750
You placed your bet, ma'am?

54:39.820 --> 54:43.620
Just.

54:43.690 --> 54:47.250
Horses are ready to race.

54:47.330 --> 54:50.321
They're off!

54:56.841 --> 55:01.281
Come on! Come on! Your nag's
making a run for it on the outside!

55:03.451 --> 55:06.641
Come on! Come on!

55:09.251 --> 55:11.911
You picked another winner!

55:18.901 --> 55:21.991
I thought you
were going to dinner.

55:22.071 --> 55:25.331
Hugh, take care of
the Nekhovich memory card.

55:27.071 --> 55:29.371
Where is it?

55:29.441 --> 55:33.542
In the envelope
in my jacket pocket.

55:34.942 --> 55:38.642
My right jacket pocket.

55:38.722 --> 55:42.852
We at our state-of-the-art
solar-powered Biocyte building,

55:42.922 --> 55:46.292
recognize that eternal vigilance
is the price of health,

55:46.362 --> 55:49.622
whether it's funding the teaching center
at the Royal Prince Edward Hospital,

55:49.692 --> 55:52.182
removing aerosol products
from the market...

55:52.262 --> 55:55.432
or braving the influenza quarantine
at Bruny Island late last month.

55:55.502 --> 55:59.962
At Biocyte, your life
is our life's work.

56:01.672 --> 56:04.502
We've got an opportunity here.

56:04.572 --> 56:08.472
I'm not going to miss it.

56:37.363 --> 56:39.803
George, take me home.

56:56.784 --> 56:58.724
George?

57:01.554 --> 57:04.394
George!

57:12.304 --> 57:15.174
What the hell?

57:18.104 --> 57:20.874
George!

57:27.514 --> 57:30.454
George! George!

57:36.125 --> 57:38.895
Sean?

57:42.395 --> 57:44.335
Sean?

58:21.706 --> 58:24.266
Shhh.

58:25.946 --> 58:27.876
Easy.

58:27.946 --> 58:29.876
Oh, Ethan.

58:29.946 --> 58:31.936
Are you okay?

58:32.016 --> 58:34.616
Yeah, I am now.

59:20.197 --> 59:24.327
- What is this?
- A visit from an old friend.

59:24.407 --> 59:29.237
You crashed
on the plane. You're dead.

59:29.307 --> 59:33.678
Dead, certainly.
But dead is a little extreme.

59:35.448 --> 59:38.938
On the other hand, when my colleague
Gradski had your pulse...

59:39.018 --> 59:43.618
and your blood pressure,
he had less than a day to live.

59:48.358 --> 59:50.528
You are infected with Chimera,
my friend.

59:54.738 --> 59:56.758
No use, my friend.

59:56.838 --> 01:00:00.668
The medical staff
wants no part of this.

01:00:00.738 --> 01:00:04.178
Doctors don't fancy the idea
of dying any more than anybody else.

01:00:04.248 --> 01:00:06.838
How could I possibly be infected?

01:00:06.918 --> 01:00:11.508
That's exactly what Gradski said
27 hours before he died.

01:00:11.588 --> 01:00:15.889
You've got the antidote,
you miserable bastard!

01:00:15.959 --> 01:00:18.259
- You stole Bellerophon! All of it!
- My, my, my.

01:00:18.329 --> 01:00:21.849
I need it! I need it now,
you whacked-out Russian Gypsy!

01:00:21.929 --> 01:00:26.959
And what about Gradski, who you
deliberately infected with Chimera?

01:00:27.039 --> 01:00:28.629
How was I to know they needed...

01:00:28.699 --> 01:00:30.539
to be treated with Bellerophon
within 20 hours?

01:00:30.609 --> 01:00:34.699
- By asking me.
- You still don't get it, do you?

01:00:34.779 --> 01:00:38.979
I needed to know just how bad
the disease was in the real world,

01:00:39.049 --> 01:00:41.379
not just the lab.

01:00:41.449 --> 01:00:44.179
You were genetically splicing
together strains of influenza...

01:00:44.249 --> 01:00:46.919
to create a cure for all influenzas.

01:00:46.989 --> 01:00:50.719
But you were also creating
a disease so terrible in Chimera,

01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:53.160
the cure would be priceless.

01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:56.390
I needed Chimera in order
to peddle Bellerophon.

01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:58.760
It's not that difficult
to understand, is it?

01:00:58.830 --> 01:01:03.030
Look, I've got the virus.
You've got the cure.

01:01:03.110 --> 01:01:05.270
I need them both.

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:07.930
Time was a shot of penicillin
would knock off...

01:01:08.010 --> 01:01:10.310
every bloody bug in the zoo.
Not anymore.

01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:15.180
If I couldn't make money killing
the microscopic little shits out there,

01:01:15.250 --> 01:01:19.210
well, you'd help me put one out
there that I could make money on.

01:01:19.290 --> 01:01:22.620
Well, there it is.
I've confessed.

01:01:22.690 --> 01:01:25.820
I, John C. McCloy,

01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:29.160
am in business to make money.

01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:34.501
Now, forget any deal you may have
made with that thug Ambrose.

01:01:34.571 --> 01:01:38.231
Get me treated,
and let's go back to work.

01:01:38.311 --> 01:01:40.401
You know,

01:01:40.481 --> 01:01:44.541
I think it's a little late for that.

01:01:44.611 --> 01:01:48.781
Do give my regards to Gradski...

01:01:48.851 --> 01:01:51.011
if you see him.

01:02:01.661 --> 01:02:03.601
Well...

01:02:06.471 --> 01:02:08.601
I've heard...

01:02:11.341 --> 01:02:14.432
all I need to hear.

01:02:16.912 --> 01:02:19.712
Nyah...

01:02:19.782 --> 01:02:24.552
it's imperative that we do nothing
to alarm Ambrose.

01:02:24.622 --> 01:02:27.092
What?

01:02:27.162 --> 01:02:29.952
You told me to get out of there
as soon as possible.

01:02:30.032 --> 01:02:33.692
-I thought you were here to collect me!
-Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!

01:02:33.762 --> 01:02:37.392
Listen to me.
There's no time to talk.

01:02:37.472 --> 01:02:42.132
It is critical,
absolutely critical,

01:02:42.202 --> 01:02:46.042
that you do whatever Ambrose asks.

01:02:50.012 --> 01:02:52.242
Do you understand me?

01:02:55.283 --> 01:02:57.953
Don't worry.

01:02:58.023 --> 01:03:02.253
It will all be over...
very soon.

01:03:07.763 --> 01:03:11.353
That's a promise.

01:03:12.853 --> 01:03:14.793
Go on.

01:03:16.353 --> 01:03:18.553
Go on. Off you go.

01:03:49.494 --> 01:03:52.514
Luther, we know this much.
Nekhovich gets on a plane...

01:03:52.594 --> 01:03:55.354
to go to the Center for
Disease Control in Atlanta.

01:03:55.434 --> 01:03:58.454
He's carrying a virus
he created, Chimera,

01:03:58.534 --> 01:04:01.664
and the cure for that virus,
Bellerophon.

01:04:04.774 --> 01:04:06.764
Ambrose doesn't have the virus.

01:04:06.844 --> 01:04:08.774
That's why Ambrose needs McCloy.

01:04:10.714 --> 01:04:13.734
So we go into Biocyte, kill Chimera,

01:04:13.814 --> 01:04:17.775
Ambrose has a cure
without a disease,

01:04:17.855 --> 01:04:20.115
and we're home free.

01:04:20.195 --> 01:04:24.385
You were right.
Hunt stung McCloy tonight.

01:04:24.465 --> 01:04:26.755
So he knows.

01:04:26.835 --> 01:04:31.325
He'll be going into Biocyte.

01:04:31.405 --> 01:04:35.865
Good. Then we'll know
where he'll be, don't we?

01:04:38.275 --> 01:04:40.905
Well done, Hugh.

01:04:40.975 --> 01:04:42.945
Well done.

01:04:52.955 --> 01:04:57.896
Oi! You're home, mate. Home.

01:04:59.466 --> 01:05:02.796
Where's George?

01:05:02.866 --> 01:05:04.896
My regular driver?
Where is he?

01:05:04.966 --> 01:05:07.666
He's gone home sick.
Touch of the flu.

01:05:10.246 --> 01:05:12.576
-Is the building up and running yet?
-Mmm.

01:05:16.446 --> 01:05:20.286
-That's not exactly it.
-Sorry, but this is a Biocyte facility.

01:05:20.356 --> 01:05:23.756
Their storage structure.
I'll have it up in a minute.

01:05:25.926 --> 01:05:29.856
- Okay, take a look at this.
- Start from the inside out.

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:33.086
All storage and production
of Chimera is done here,

01:05:33.166 --> 01:05:35.827
in this lab on the 42ndfloor.

01:05:35.897 --> 01:05:38.927
Hunt's target will be the Chimera,

01:05:39.007 --> 01:05:43.937
stored and manufactured
at Biocyte on the 42nd floor.

01:05:44.007 --> 01:05:48.637
If you look at Hunt's
operational history, and I have,

01:05:48.717 --> 01:05:53.017
he invariably favors
misdirection over confrontation.

01:05:53.087 --> 01:05:57.677
He'll never break into Biocyte from
the bottom where security is heaviest.

01:05:57.757 --> 01:05:59.947
No garage entrances.

01:06:00.027 --> 01:06:04.587
Lobby's protected by five guards
on rotating patrol.

01:06:04.667 --> 01:06:08.097
Not goin' in from the ground.
Show me the atrium.

01:06:08.167 --> 01:06:12.497
The atrium?
One of a kind.

01:06:12.567 --> 01:06:15.337
Runs down through the center
of the building.

01:06:15.407 --> 01:06:18.898
Provides 24-hournaturallight via
mirrors and daylight storage cells.

01:06:18.978 --> 01:06:21.378
Optimal growing conditions
for the virus.

01:06:21.448 --> 01:06:24.678
Ends in a glass floor which doubles
as part of the lab ceiling.

01:06:28.158 --> 01:06:32.218
Uh-uh. The atrium roof
closes at sundown.

01:06:32.288 --> 01:06:35.688
And if the louvers are up for
more than 40seconds at night,

01:06:35.758 --> 01:06:37.818
the civil emergency alarms
are tripped.

01:06:37.898 --> 01:06:39.828
Those, even I can't stop.

01:06:39.898 --> 01:06:42.498
Ethan, we have
a total of 40 seconds...

01:06:42.568 --> 01:06:46.128
to get you in
and the cables out.

01:06:46.208 --> 01:06:50.108
No, Hunt will prefer to enter
Biocyte somewhere from the top...

01:06:50.178 --> 01:06:52.008
where security is minimal.

01:06:52.078 --> 01:06:55.848
He'll undoubtedly engage
in some aerobatic insanity...

01:06:55.918 --> 01:06:59.439
before he'll risk harming a hair
on a security guard's head.

01:07:13.799 --> 01:07:17.199
- Check-check. Got copy?
- You're five-by-five.

01:07:20.609 --> 01:07:23.129
Luther, how we doin '?

01:07:23.209 --> 01:07:26.309
Not there yet,
Ethan. I'll give you the word.

01:07:28.779 --> 01:07:30.749
Billy, ready to go?

01:07:34.419 --> 01:07:36.720
Okay, package away in five--

01:07:36.790 --> 01:07:38.760
I'm not ready.
The louvers aren't moving.

01:07:38.830 --> 01:07:41.120
Come on, Luther! We gotta go!

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:44.060
Wait, there's
a glitch in the access code.

01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:55.270
Luther,
we're out of time. On the count.

01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:58.510
Please, baby, open up, open up.

01:07:58.580 --> 01:08:01.570
- Five, four,
- Come on!

01:08:01.650 --> 01:08:03.880
three, two, one!

01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:06.420
- I'm going now!
- Ethan, wait!

01:08:41.791 --> 01:08:45.991
Twenty five,
twenty four, twenty three,

01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:50.051
twenty two, twenty one, twenty.

01:08:50.131 --> 01:08:53.501
Ethan, you've got 19seconds
to clear the cable.

01:09:02.182 --> 01:09:05.152
Okay, retracting cable!

01:09:09.152 --> 01:09:11.142
Come on!

01:09:11.221 --> 01:09:15.122
Nine, eight, seven, six,

01:09:15.192 --> 01:09:18.721
five, four, three, two--

01:09:20.862 --> 01:09:23.332
Cable's clear!

01:09:36.212 --> 01:09:40.483
Transponder activated.
Reading package and cable clear.

01:09:48.363 --> 01:09:51.153
He'll breach the lab
at the only possible time,

01:09:51.233 --> 01:09:54.252
whether you break in
from the ground or the roof.

01:09:54.333 --> 01:09:57.303
It's 2300 hours, one minute...

01:09:57.373 --> 01:10:00.933
when the air filtration generators will
cover the sound of Hunt's break-in...

01:10:01.003 --> 01:10:03.733
and the rotating guards
make the building vulnerable...

01:10:03.813 --> 01:10:05.473
to our break-in from below.

01:10:07.283 --> 01:10:09.973
Ethan,
the generator's about to go active.

01:10:10.043 --> 01:10:13.973
Just a friendly reminder. We'll be
out of contact for eight minutes.

01:10:46.104 --> 01:10:48.904
I'm betting
Hunt will destroy Chimera...

01:10:48.974 --> 01:10:51.874
rather than attempt
to preserve any part of it.

01:10:51.944 --> 01:10:54.604
He'll have to do it
in two places.

01:10:54.684 --> 01:11:00.145
First, the incubation room
where the growth vials are kept.

01:11:02.395 --> 01:11:06.055
And finally,
in the inoculation chamber...

01:11:06.125 --> 01:11:10.795
holding the last remaining Chimera
virus in three injection guns.

01:11:10.865 --> 01:11:15.565
He won't be allowed to destroy
the virus in those guns.

01:11:30.715 --> 01:11:33.385
What's this?
You're on time, for once?

01:11:33.455 --> 01:11:35.515
Not exactly, sport.

01:11:41.096 --> 01:11:44.296
John C. McCloy.

01:12:04.116 --> 01:12:07.016
Billy, I think we've got a problem.

01:12:07.086 --> 01:12:10.686
Nyah's on the wing up early.
Billy, do you copy?

01:12:10.756 --> 01:12:13.696
Yeah, I got you, Luther.
Sorry, exactly where is she?

01:12:13.766 --> 01:12:16.556
- In the building.
- Say again, mate.

01:12:16.636 --> 01:12:19.467
Sounds like you're saying
she's in the building.

01:12:19.537 --> 01:12:21.967
I am. She is.

01:12:22.037 --> 01:12:25.907
Uh, well, then she's not likely
to be alone, is she, mate?

01:12:25.977 --> 01:12:28.167
She's in the elevator,
headed towards Ethan.

01:12:28.247 --> 01:12:30.407
The question is.:
How many of them?

01:12:30.477 --> 01:12:32.917
I can't get through to Ethan,
not till the generators go.

01:12:32.987 --> 01:12:35.177
- Yeah, well, when's that?
- Not for another...

01:12:35.247 --> 01:12:37.247
five-and-a-half minutes.

01:13:12.828 --> 01:13:16.758
Chimera
in vitro pH and temperature level...

01:13:16.828 --> 01:13:19.588
outside optimal range.

01:13:19.668 --> 01:13:23.358
Chimera in vitro pH
and temperature level...

01:13:23.438 --> 01:13:25.528
outside optimal range.

01:13:25.608 --> 01:13:29.938
Chimera working seed stock pH
at critical level.

01:13:30.008 --> 01:13:33.308
Alert.
Chimera stock life threatened.

01:13:33.378 --> 01:13:37.868
Alert.
Chimera stock life terminated.

01:13:42.659 --> 01:13:45.679
Come on, Ethan.
Come on.

01:14:02.079 --> 01:14:04.239
Subject is contaminant-free.

01:14:04.309 --> 01:14:06.609
Zero contaminant factor.

01:14:18.059 --> 01:14:20.289
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

01:14:20.359 --> 01:14:24.130
Luther, what the hell can we do?

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:26.220
What can we do?

01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:30.260
Hope he kills all the bugs before
the yellow dot gets to the red one.

01:15:21.751 --> 01:15:23.851
However we travel,

01:15:23.921 --> 01:15:28.091
I must arrive at my destination
within 20 hours of departure.

01:15:32.771 --> 01:15:35.231
How was I to know
that he needed to be treated...

01:15:35.301 --> 01:15:38.241
with Bellerophon within 20hours?

01:16:01.132 --> 01:16:03.062
Get him.

01:16:25.323 --> 01:16:27.583
How much longer
before you can reach him?

01:16:27.653 --> 01:16:30.493
We've got29seconds
before the generators turn off,

01:16:30.563 --> 01:16:32.493
then Ethan will be back on-line.

01:16:54.433 --> 01:16:55.863
Ahh!

01:17:19.194 --> 01:17:21.954
Luther! Luther!

01:17:53.425 --> 01:17:55.485
Hold your fire!

01:17:55.565 --> 01:17:58.125
Hold your fire, damn it!

01:18:12.245 --> 01:18:15.475
Well, Hunt...

01:18:15.545 --> 01:18:17.815
how've you been?

01:18:20.515 --> 01:18:22.455
Fighting a bit of a cold.

01:18:22.525 --> 01:18:24.686
Aww.

01:18:27.626 --> 01:18:30.526
You know, that was the hardest part
of having to portray you--

01:18:30.596 --> 01:18:34.826
grinning like an idiot
every 15 minutes.

01:18:34.896 --> 01:18:38.236
I would've thought the hardest part was
curbing that pressing need of yours...

01:18:38.306 --> 01:18:40.276
to get your gun off.

01:18:40.336 --> 01:18:43.506
You were in such a hurry
to knock off that 747...

01:18:43.576 --> 01:18:46.096
you never figured out
where Chimera really was.

01:18:46.176 --> 01:18:48.706
- I knew where it was.
- Oh.

01:18:48.786 --> 01:18:51.716
Then you knew the only way Nekhovich
could smuggle the live virus...

01:18:51.786 --> 01:18:55.546
is by injecting himself and using
his own bloodstream as a petri dish.

01:18:55.626 --> 01:18:58.646
You knew that...
while you were knocking him off,

01:18:58.726 --> 01:19:01.656
destroying the very thing
you came for.

01:19:08.837 --> 01:19:11.707
Stop!
Put a sock in it!

01:19:14.577 --> 01:19:18.537
Hit that bloody gun, and you'll
spray the virus all over the place!

01:19:18.607 --> 01:19:21.907
There it is, guys.

01:19:21.987 --> 01:19:25.107
The last of it.

01:19:25.187 --> 01:19:27.347
What was the top bid?

01:19:27.417 --> 01:19:30.447
Why? You gonna make me
a better offer?

01:19:30.527 --> 01:19:33.687
Than £37 million?
Not really.

01:19:33.757 --> 01:19:36.457
Oh!

01:19:36.527 --> 01:19:40.797
Somebody has been slipping you
our mail.

01:19:40.867 --> 01:19:45.068
Come on out here, you bad girl.

01:19:56.848 --> 01:20:02.048
Sean, she doesn't belong here.
Let her go.

01:20:02.128 --> 01:20:05.388
She wouldn't be here...

01:20:05.458 --> 01:20:08.728
if it wasn't for you, Hunt.

01:20:15.098 --> 01:20:20.058
From this moment, you are
responsible for what happens to her.

01:20:20.138 --> 01:20:23.138
And if you're looking out
for her well-being,

01:20:23.208 --> 01:20:28.149
I suggest you advise her to pick up
the injection gun and bring it to me.

01:20:28.219 --> 01:20:31.189
Ball's in your court, Hunt.

01:20:38.829 --> 01:20:42.919
Nyah's in the building.
Do you copy?

01:20:42.999 --> 01:20:45.159
Thank you.

01:21:00.679 --> 01:21:04.480
How do you know he won't shoot you
the minute he's got it?

01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:07.550
Please. One can't hold Nyah
responsible for her actions.

01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:11.220
You know women, mate.
Like monkeys they are.

01:21:11.290 --> 01:21:15.360
Won't let go of one branch
till they get a grip on the next!

01:21:17.370 --> 01:21:20.340
Get it, Nyah.
I'll cover you.

01:21:52.141 --> 01:21:55.941
I am waiting.

01:22:07.121 --> 01:22:11.751
Things haven't exactly worked out the
way you thought they would, Ethan.

01:22:11.821 --> 01:22:13.551
Sorry.

01:22:30.112 --> 01:22:32.232
You bitch!

01:22:47.822 --> 01:22:51.922
You're not gonna shoot me, Sean.
Not this bitch.

01:22:51.992 --> 01:22:55.622
'Cause she's worth £37 million.

01:23:27.303 --> 01:23:30.033
- What did you think you were doing?
- I wasn't thinking!

01:23:30.103 --> 01:23:33.473
Just trying to stop you
from getting hurt, that's all!

01:23:33.543 --> 01:23:36.843
You who don't have a conscience.

01:23:36.913 --> 01:23:38.843
I guess I lied.

01:24:06.574 --> 01:24:09.774
You can't get us both
out of here, can you?

01:24:22.354 --> 01:24:24.324
I'm infected with Chimera.

01:24:24.394 --> 01:24:27.125
You know you don't have a choice.
Just do it.

01:24:28.535 --> 01:24:30.465
Do it now!

01:24:51.455 --> 01:24:54.255
We've got 19 hours and 58 minutes!

01:24:54.325 --> 01:24:57.725
I'll get Bellerophon
into your system before then!

01:25:00.895 --> 01:25:05.265
Just stay alive!
I'm not going to lose you!

01:26:15.077 --> 01:26:17.437
Feel like pleading for your life?

01:26:22.647 --> 01:26:25.947
Well, then, how about dying...

01:26:26.017 --> 01:26:29.618
so you can make me a lot of money?

01:26:35.158 --> 01:26:38.958
In just a few hours time,
you can be assured...

01:26:39.028 --> 01:26:42.988
of going down in history
as the Typhoid Mary of Oz.

01:26:44.268 --> 01:26:46.608
G'day.

01:26:49.878 --> 01:26:53.178
There's not a chance of locating Nyah
until can access the satellite.

01:26:53.248 --> 01:26:56.808
And there's not a chance of doing that
until I can get this computer fixed.

01:26:56.888 --> 01:26:59.148
How much time does she have left?

01:26:59.218 --> 01:27:02.948
Not long. But whatever happens,
Nyah will take care of Nyah.

01:27:03.028 --> 01:27:05.318
-What do you mean?
-Unless we dose her with Bellerophon,

01:27:05.388 --> 01:27:08.159
Nyah will kill herself.

01:27:08.229 --> 01:27:10.389
So first things first.

01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:07.920
Ethan, Ambrose and his team
have arrived...

01:28:07.990 --> 01:28:10.390
over the bridge,
and Nyah's not with him, mate.

01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:12.390
Copy that.

01:28:18.530 --> 01:28:22.900
You all right, mate? Looks like
pretty heavy security from here.

01:28:22.970 --> 01:28:27.030
What's it look like from there?

01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:29.041
Risky.

01:29:47.092 --> 01:29:50.623
Simon? Simon!

01:29:50.693 --> 01:29:53.293
Stay here.

01:30:08.813 --> 01:30:12.113
Breached the structure
at the 10:00 grating.

01:30:23.733 --> 01:30:27.923
It's a DNA match.
The blood's loaded with Chimera.

01:30:35.644 --> 01:30:38.704
And they certainly have Bellerophon.

01:30:40.744 --> 01:30:43.184
Well, then you've got
both the virus and the antivirus,

01:30:43.254 --> 01:30:45.514
which means I've got
30 million for you.

01:30:45.584 --> 01:30:50.114
Not exactly.
We don't want just your cash.

01:30:50.194 --> 01:30:54.254
- What do you want?
- Stock, Mr. McCloy.

01:30:54.324 --> 01:30:58.884
Stock options,
to be a little more precise.

01:31:05.434 --> 01:31:09.804
Cut her loose...
right in the center of town.

01:31:09.874 --> 01:31:12.145
The more crowded the better.

01:31:14.105 --> 01:31:17.335
Ethan, just picked up an Ambrose
call. Nyah's been dropped off.

01:31:17.415 --> 01:31:20.845
- Where is she?
- Somewhere in Sydney.

01:31:32.095 --> 01:31:35.085
Somewhere in Sydney?
Care to harden the target?

01:31:35.165 --> 01:31:36.725
I can't until...

01:31:36.795 --> 01:31:39.025
I can get the GPS up
on our computer. It's down.

01:31:39.095 --> 01:31:43.725
The clock is ticking.

01:31:43.805 --> 01:31:46.465
How quickly can you manufacture
more of the antivirus?

01:31:46.545 --> 01:31:48.875
No time at all,
once I've got it.

01:31:48.945 --> 01:31:53.106
Good. Biocyte stock is just a few weeks
away from going through the roof.

01:31:53.186 --> 01:31:55.476
- What are you talking about?
- An outbreak of Chimera.

01:31:55.546 --> 01:31:59.546
- Where?
- Downtown Sydney, for a start.

01:31:59.626 --> 01:32:01.556
You create the supply, Mr. McCloy.

01:32:01.626 --> 01:32:03.556
We've just created the demand.

01:32:03.626 --> 01:32:05.556
Three million people in Sydney...

01:32:05.626 --> 01:32:07.656
and 17 million people
in Australia...

01:32:07.726 --> 01:32:10.526
are going to need Bellerophon
within the next few days,

01:32:10.596 --> 01:32:12.896
not to mention
the rest of the world.

01:32:12.966 --> 01:32:15.436
Now, this is how
it's going to work.

01:32:15.506 --> 01:32:17.906
- Wallis, the shares outstanding are?
- 93.4 million.

01:32:17.976 --> 01:32:22.906
Which means, Mr. McCloy, we need to
get our hands on 480,000 options.

01:32:22.976 --> 01:32:25.846
We'll borrow your 30 million
to buy those options.

01:32:25.916 --> 01:32:29.646
Your stock has never sold
above $31 a share.

01:32:29.716 --> 01:32:32.157
When your stock goes north of 200,

01:32:32.217 --> 01:32:36.127
which it will, those options
will be worth billions,

01:32:36.197 --> 01:32:41.527
and I will own 51% of Biocyte.

01:32:41.597 --> 01:32:44.537
This is outrageous.

01:32:44.597 --> 01:32:47.367
I will not let you
take control of my company.

01:32:47.437 --> 01:32:50.167
Sit down.

01:33:29.248 --> 01:33:32.908
You'll be a billionaire.
It's better than being broke.

01:33:32.988 --> 01:33:34.648
I have terrorists and...

01:33:34.718 --> 01:33:37.378
other pharmaceutical
companies standing in line.

01:33:42.958 --> 01:33:45.988
The ball's in your court,
Mr. McCloy.

01:34:41.290 --> 01:34:44.720
Run that bastard down.

01:34:56.970 --> 01:35:01.130
We're running short
on time, Mr. McCloy.

01:35:02.210 --> 01:35:06.110
We have got to conclude
our business.

01:35:06.180 --> 01:35:11.310
Yes. Start the transfer.

01:35:15.521 --> 01:35:20.481
Follow it...
and let me know.

01:36:26.092 --> 01:36:28.822
Uh!

01:36:28.892 --> 01:36:31.122
Raise your hands very slowly.

01:36:31.202 --> 01:36:33.493
Sure you want me to do this?

01:36:33.573 --> 01:36:38.063
Raise your hands very slowly.

01:37:11.343 --> 01:37:14.574
Ethan, Ethan, do you copy?
Do you copy?

01:37:19.514 --> 01:37:21.954
Keep it going!

01:37:29.024 --> 01:37:33.654
Sean, this
rat's reached the end of the maze.

01:37:33.734 --> 01:37:36.354
Is he alive?

01:37:36.434 --> 01:37:39.064
Yeah, more or less.

01:37:40.734 --> 01:37:42.834
Bring him to me.

01:37:42.904 --> 01:37:44.494
Go!

01:37:51.414 --> 01:37:54.385
Sean, transfer completed.

01:38:14.145 --> 01:38:18.085
Well done, Stamp.
Well done.

01:38:37.036 --> 01:38:39.166
Stop mumbling!

01:38:39.236 --> 01:38:42.406
I'm afraid he's got no choice.

01:38:42.476 --> 01:38:44.996
I believe I broke his jaw.

01:38:45.076 --> 01:38:47.606
Stamp, I'm impressed.

01:38:47.676 --> 01:38:50.406
Right. We don't have
a lot of time, Hunt.

01:38:50.486 --> 01:38:52.916
What ever you got to say,
say it now.

01:38:55.086 --> 01:38:58.146
How about giving us a big smile?

01:39:00.526 --> 01:39:02.686
- No?
- What are you doing?

01:39:04.926 --> 01:39:08.796
Get down on your knees.

01:39:11.106 --> 01:39:15.477
Now, this is what's known...

01:39:15.547 --> 01:39:18.277
as getting your gun off.

01:40:28.568 --> 01:40:30.538
There he is!

01:40:40.449 --> 01:40:42.539
Ethan!

01:40:57.399 --> 01:41:00.489
Just back off
and pinpoint your positions!

01:41:59.001 --> 01:42:01.231
Luther, clear the bridge for me!

01:42:05.001 --> 01:42:08.401
Hunt's heading for the bridge,
coming in at 12:00 high.

01:42:25.221 --> 01:42:27.521
Oh, I'm mad now.

01:43:05.962 --> 01:43:08.262
Ha-ha!

01:43:38.093 --> 01:43:41.263
-You all right, mate?
-That punk put a hole in my Versace!

01:44:44.865 --> 01:44:47.565
Ethan, the computer's up.
I've got Nyah.

01:44:47.635 --> 01:44:49.465
She's moved out of the city.

01:44:49.535 --> 01:44:51.665
She's on the north head bluff
approaching the cliffs.

01:44:51.735 --> 01:44:53.935
- But I can't get a visual.
- Copy!

01:44:54.005 --> 01:44:56.605
She's only got
a little time left!

01:44:56.675 --> 01:44:58.945
Track ahead and pick her up!

01:45:05.685 --> 01:45:10.355
-I can't get a good shot.
-Ethan, we won't be able to cover you!

01:45:10.425 --> 01:45:14.085
My earpiece is failing!
You've got me on GPS!

01:45:14.165 --> 01:45:16.325
Bring her to me!

01:45:24.376 --> 01:45:26.776
Billy, north head bluff.
Haul ass.

01:45:53.766 --> 01:45:57.136
- Get out there and keep firing!
- I can't see anything!

01:45:57.206 --> 01:46:00.737
Slow down, mate!
Slow down!

01:47:59.079 --> 01:48:01.740
Range is 2K.

01:50:53.754 --> 01:50:55.954
Ahhh!

01:51:35.135 --> 01:51:38.465
Go ahead.
Use it, Hunt.

01:51:38.535 --> 01:51:41.475
It's not a bad way to go.

01:51:41.545 --> 01:51:45.235
It's a lot better than
the way that bitch is gonna die.

01:52:32.196 --> 01:52:34.256
Hey, there she is!

01:54:38.529 --> 01:54:41.369
Hunt!

01:54:44.100 --> 01:54:47.040
You should've killed me.

01:56:26.742 --> 01:56:29.002
Miss Hall's blood, it appears,

01:56:29.082 --> 01:56:31.742
has absolutely no elements
of the Chimera virus,

01:56:31.812 --> 01:56:33.752
not even antibodies.

01:56:33.812 --> 01:56:36.082
Yes. I gathered as much.

01:56:36.152 --> 01:56:39.082
But you were under specific
instructions, Mr. Hunt,

01:56:39.152 --> 01:56:42.142
to bring back a living sample
of the Chimera virus.

01:56:42.222 --> 01:56:46.063
I'd be very interested to know how,
after you managed this recovery,

01:56:46.133 --> 01:56:48.723
it subsequently got destroyed.

01:56:48.803 --> 01:56:52.293
By fire.
It's the best way, really.

01:56:52.373 --> 01:56:55.933
Oh. Well, Mr. Hunt,

01:56:56.003 --> 01:56:59.633
as for Miss Hall,
in light of her efforts,

01:56:59.713 --> 01:57:03.803
her criminal record
will certainly be expunged.

01:57:03.883 --> 01:57:07.283
Wiped out.
I'm assuming you approve.

01:57:10.353 --> 01:57:12.283
I do.

01:57:12.353 --> 01:57:16.523
Yeah. Where is she now, by the way?
Any idea?

01:57:16.593 --> 01:57:19.293
I don't know.
Not exactly.

01:57:20.493 --> 01:57:22.553
So, what are your plans?

01:57:22.633 --> 01:57:26.574
I don't know.
Uh, some sort of vacation.

01:57:26.634 --> 01:57:29.194
I'll let you know where I'm going.

01:57:29.274 --> 01:57:32.304
You don't have to do that.

01:57:32.374 --> 01:57:35.214
It wouldn't be a vacation
if you did.

01:58:25.365 --> 01:58:27.295
Let's get lost.
