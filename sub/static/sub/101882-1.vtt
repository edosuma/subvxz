(upbeat country music)

00:27.102 --> 00:29.177
¶ It's getting cold again ¶

00:29.196 --> 00:33.866
¶ I'm hoping that this year
we'll get a little snow ¶

00:34.017 --> 00:37.094
¶ Hm, hm ¶

00:37.112 --> 00:39.872
¶ We're taking out
the decorations ¶

00:39.948 --> 00:44.543
¶ Hung up all the
lights and mistletoe ¶

00:44.620 --> 00:47.621
¶ Hm, hm ¶

00:47.773 --> 00:49.882
¶ The counter's
full of cookies ¶

00:49.958 --> 00:54.887
¶ And the living room's
got a big ole tree ¶

00:55.038 --> 00:58.057
¶ Hm, hm ¶

00:58.208 --> 01:00.559
¶ I'm trying to keep
up our traditions ¶

01:00.636 --> 01:05.064
¶ Trying to live up
to our memories ¶

01:05.215 --> 01:08.292
¶ Hm, hm ¶

01:08.310 --> 01:12.963
¶ But I know come starry night ¶

01:12.981 --> 01:18.135
¶ Sitting by that fire light ¶

01:18.487 --> 01:23.415
¶ That there's no Christmas ¶

01:25.160 --> 01:28.145
¶ Without you ¶

01:28.147 --> 01:31.381
(upbeat country music)

01:37.339 --> 01:38.263
- [Carter] Mom, mom!

01:38.415 --> 01:39.339
Mom!

01:39.491 --> 01:40.933
We wrapped our
teacher's presents.

01:41.084 --> 01:42.175
- Ah.

01:42.328 --> 01:43.585
- And you need to judge
which one is best.

01:43.604 --> 01:44.937
- We don't have time.

01:45.088 --> 01:46.271
It's the last day of school
before Christmas break,

01:46.423 --> 01:47.664
you don't want to be late.

01:47.683 --> 01:49.757
- But the loser has to
make both of our beds.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.443
- For a week.

01:51.595 --> 01:54.279
- Oh wow, that's pretty serious.

01:54.431 --> 01:56.840
Okay, well we have five
minutes before we have to leave

01:56.859 --> 01:57.950
so let's do this.

01:58.101 --> 02:00.619
Please place your
presents upon the table.

02:00.696 --> 02:02.287
Very nice.

02:02.364 --> 02:03.697
It's going to be very tough.

02:03.849 --> 02:06.516
Carter, your use of
adhesives is prolific.

02:06.535 --> 02:07.376
- What's prolific?

02:08.871 --> 02:10.379
- Don't worry, it's really good.

02:11.540 --> 02:12.965
- [Carter] All right, I win!

02:13.116 --> 02:15.634
- And Peyton, the way you
seemingly use Christmas flare

02:15.711 --> 02:17.970
as a metaphor for the
accesses of the holidays.

02:18.121 --> 02:18.929
It's insightful.

02:20.048 --> 02:21.031
- Oh yeah.

02:21.049 --> 02:22.808
I'm insightful.

02:23.978 --> 02:25.102
- But who wins?

02:26.388 --> 02:29.148
- It's too difficult to
decide, I call it a tie.

02:30.967 --> 02:33.318
- [Peyton] You
always call a tie.

02:33.470 --> 02:35.571
- Don't forget this, it's
for your show and tell.

02:36.732 --> 02:40.050
- What's up with Nanna's hair?

02:40.052 --> 02:41.568
- [Erin] It was the
style back then.

02:41.720 --> 02:43.720
- It wasn't very stylish.

02:43.739 --> 02:45.497
- Yeah, it's pretty silly.

02:45.649 --> 02:47.499
People liked big
hair in the 90's.

02:47.576 --> 02:49.393
- Do we have one
of these albums?

02:49.411 --> 02:51.319
- Hm, all y'all's
pictures are online.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.505
I can print some out, but later.

02:53.657 --> 02:55.899
We gotta go 'cause I have
an appointment with Tessa.

02:55.918 --> 02:58.068
(phone ringing)

02:58.086 --> 03:00.762
- Why do you never answer
the phone when Grandee calls?

03:02.499 --> 03:03.682
- Okay, come on, we gotta go.

03:03.759 --> 03:04.850
Let's go.

03:04.927 --> 03:06.351
Grab your jackets,
quick, quick, quick.

03:06.503 --> 03:09.688
(upbeat country music)

03:20.108 --> 03:22.850
- When am I ever gonna
need to stack quarters?

03:22.870 --> 03:26.872
- Just pretend you're a bounty
pirate, stacking your gold.

03:27.023 --> 03:29.791
- I'd like to make these
useless fingers walk the plank.

03:31.027 --> 03:34.104
- Even when you aren't
successful, you're

03:34.106 --> 03:35.772
and dexterity equals?

03:35.791 --> 03:37.382
- Blessed independence.

03:38.368 --> 03:40.126
- Oh, hold on.

03:40.279 --> 03:41.386
I don't want to forget,

03:41.538 --> 03:44.389
since this is our
last appointment

03:46.785 --> 03:50.044
- Aw, you shouldn't have
to get me a present.

03:50.064 --> 03:52.880
- I got all my patients a
gift, but yours is special

03:52.900 --> 03:55.400
'cause don't tell anyone
you're my favorite.

03:55.552 --> 03:56.735
- You can't help yourself.

03:58.313 --> 04:00.072
I've got a magnetic personality.

04:00.223 --> 04:01.073
- That's true.

04:01.224 --> 04:01.990
Open it.

04:03.151 --> 04:05.302
- Is this just another exercise?

04:05.320 --> 04:06.495
- No, but good idea.

04:13.087 --> 04:15.003
Oh my, did you do this?

04:16.982 --> 04:17.756
- You like it?

04:17.907 --> 04:18.665
- I love it.

04:18.817 --> 04:20.259
- Good, I'm glad.

04:20.335 --> 04:22.669
- What are you and your girls
doing for Christmas this year?

04:22.821 --> 04:25.155
- We'll just spend
Christmas at my mom's.

04:25.157 --> 04:27.173
- Is your father in the picture?

04:27.326 --> 04:29.326
- My parents haven't been
together since I was nine,

04:29.328 --> 04:31.344
so I don't see my dad very much.

04:31.497 --> 04:34.498
He's a good guy and I
love him, it's just.

04:34.516 --> 04:36.108
- Does he live far from Austin?

04:37.019 --> 04:38.092
- A couple of hours.

04:39.004 --> 04:40.612
- Why don't you
see him more often?

04:43.767 --> 04:45.008
- Do you want to try
stacking the quarters

04:45.027 --> 04:46.952
with these fingers now?

04:48.864 --> 04:53.792
- Sometimes the holidays
can be a lot of pressure.

04:59.374 --> 05:00.132
- Good job.

05:02.528 --> 05:03.260
Great.

05:08.124 --> 05:10.291
- [Nana] I never would have
guessed Phil's Christmas present

05:10.311 --> 05:12.644
was a tropical holiday vacation.

05:12.796 --> 05:14.204
- He knows how much
you hate the cold.

05:14.222 --> 05:18.317
- Do you think I will
look good in this one?

05:18.468 --> 05:20.727
- Hm, you look good
in everything mom.

05:20.879 --> 05:22.821
- Oh, I just want
it to be perfect.

05:22.898 --> 05:26.158
- Oh Erin, I think Phil
is going to propose.

05:26.234 --> 05:26.992
- Really?

05:27.069 --> 05:28.160
- Yeah!

05:28.311 --> 05:29.736
- Aw.

05:29.813 --> 05:31.479
- You know, I never thought
I wanted to be married again

05:31.498 --> 05:35.500
after your dad, but Phil
has melted my heart.

05:35.577 --> 05:38.003
- Mom, I'm so happy for you.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.062
- [Nana] Thank you.

05:39.064 --> 05:41.340
You know, maybe it's time that

05:41.491 --> 05:43.759
you started thinking
about love again too.

05:44.920 --> 05:47.679
- Well, I've got
work and the girls,

05:47.831 --> 05:49.848
I'm thinking about
going back to school.

05:49.999 --> 05:52.166
Where exactly do I
fit in the romance?

05:52.186 --> 05:54.244
- It's been three
years now honey.

05:54.262 --> 05:57.505
- And we're doing great, so
why upset the apple cart?

05:57.524 --> 05:59.916
- You are a wonderful
mama to those girls.

05:59.935 --> 06:02.419
There's nothing wrong with
having somebody to lean on.

06:02.421 --> 06:04.196
- I don't need
anybody to lean on.

06:05.273 --> 06:06.940
- Honey, are you sure
you're okay with this?

06:07.092 --> 06:08.758
- Of course I am.

06:08.777 --> 06:11.787
Mom, you deserve all the
good and wonderful times.

06:13.189 --> 06:13.997
- So do you.

06:15.859 --> 06:16.708
I love you.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.103
- I love you too.

06:20.122 --> 06:21.438
I better go get the girls.

06:21.456 --> 06:23.773
I promised them we'd
make brownies after work.

06:23.792 --> 06:25.967
Have fun packing.

06:28.722 --> 06:29.971
- I am going on vacation.

06:34.711 --> 06:36.377
- [Carter] It's officially
Christmas break.

06:36.397 --> 06:37.971
- You know it's officially
a Christmas break

06:38.123 --> 06:40.047
when we start
decorating the tree.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.401
- Okay, wait until
they cool down.

06:42.552 --> 06:44.794
Now your daddy taught me
how to make those brownies.

06:44.813 --> 06:46.238
- 'Cause you can couldn't cook.

06:46.314 --> 06:48.073
- She still doesn't
know how to cook.

06:48.224 --> 06:49.741
- That is right.

06:50.819 --> 06:52.302
We made a deal
when we got married

06:52.304 --> 06:53.561
that I would make our lunches

06:53.580 --> 06:55.972
because I'm a very
talented sandwich stacker

06:55.991 --> 06:57.157
and daddy would make dinner,

06:57.309 --> 06:58.900
but he taught me to make
the Christmas brownies

06:58.919 --> 07:01.086
because he always used to say,

07:01.163 --> 07:04.481
everyone should have one holiday
recipe they know by heart.

07:04.499 --> 07:06.216
- I miss daddy
more at Christmas.

07:07.653 --> 07:09.836
- Me too, sweetie.

07:09.988 --> 07:11.930
But he's watching us
from heaven, right?

07:14.342 --> 07:17.853
- Yeah, that's how he knows
you burned the first batch.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.609
- Mom, the star's broken.

07:24.686 --> 07:28.113
- Oh, it's not broken,
it's just been loved.

07:29.191 --> 07:31.616
I think I have some tape in
the junk drawer upstairs.

07:33.845 --> 07:35.620
(phone ringing)

07:35.697 --> 07:36.621
- Oh, it's Grandee.

07:39.609 --> 07:40.366
Hi Grandee.

07:40.519 --> 07:41.251
- Peyton, hey.

07:42.704 --> 07:44.463
What do you know what's good?

07:44.614 --> 07:46.965
- We're decorating
our Christmas tree.

07:47.116 --> 07:48.191
- Hi Grandee.

07:48.210 --> 07:49.468
- Hi there, Teddy bear.

07:49.619 --> 07:50.952
Where's your mama at?

07:50.971 --> 07:52.879
- Oh, she's upstairs.

07:53.031 --> 07:55.390
- She sure isn't easy to
get ahold of these days.

07:56.885 --> 07:59.293
- She's really busy.

07:59.313 --> 08:01.128
- Yeah, you know, me too.

08:01.148 --> 08:04.316
We've got a whole mess of new
goats out here on the ranch.

08:04.392 --> 08:05.875
- Really?

08:05.894 --> 08:07.819
- Can you send us pictures?

08:07.896 --> 08:08.987
- Farrah and I were hoping that

08:09.138 --> 08:10.322
maybe you'd come out
Christmas for a visit

08:10.473 --> 08:12.716
and you could see
it for yourself.

08:12.734 --> 08:13.492
- [Carter] Yes!

08:13.568 --> 08:15.218
- Hi dad.

08:15.237 --> 08:17.144
- Can we go to
Grandee's for Christmas?

08:17.164 --> 08:18.663
- To see the baby goats.

08:18.815 --> 08:19.998
- [Dad] We'd love to see you.

08:20.149 --> 08:22.834
Farrah's got the house
all done up for Christmas.

08:22.986 --> 08:24.169
You'll have to be careful,

08:24.320 --> 08:25.587
you come out here she
doesn't decorate you too.

08:27.916 --> 08:29.424
- Oh, I don't know.

08:30.344 --> 08:31.325
- Please.

08:31.345 --> 08:32.902
- Please mom.

08:32.921 --> 08:34.304
- [Grandee] We've never had
a Christmas with the girls.

08:35.423 --> 08:36.515
- Please mom.

08:36.591 --> 08:37.432
- Please.

08:40.503 --> 08:42.336
- Well, I, I did take
the whole week off

08:42.356 --> 08:44.856
since the girls
are out of school.

08:45.008 --> 08:47.359
- [Grandee] Well then
come and spend it with us.

08:47.435 --> 08:48.768
I mean, Farrah would just
about die of happiness

08:48.920 --> 08:50.153
having a crowd to cook for.

08:52.274 --> 08:53.089
- Please mom.

08:53.108 --> 08:54.282
- I love goats so much.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.277
- Okay.

08:57.429 --> 08:58.686
We'll come dad.

08:58.705 --> 08:59.538
- Yes!

09:01.283 --> 09:03.375
- We'll get the rooms ready.

09:03.451 --> 09:04.525
- Sure.

09:04.545 --> 09:05.710
- I can't wait to see you.

09:05.862 --> 09:07.045
- We'll talk to you later.

09:07.196 --> 09:08.288
- Bye Grandee.

09:08.440 --> 09:09.506
- Bye Grandee.

09:13.962 --> 09:16.704
- Well, I guess we're
going to Grandee's.

09:16.723 --> 09:17.538
- Yay!

09:17.558 --> 09:18.390
- Yes!

09:24.973 --> 09:28.149
(subtle country music)

09:31.721 --> 09:35.407
¶ Oh what fun it is to ride
in a one horse open sleigh ¶

09:35.483 --> 09:36.466
¶ Hey ¶

09:36.484 --> 09:38.893
¶ Jingle bells, jingle bells ¶

09:38.912 --> 09:41.580
¶ Jingle all the way ¶

09:41.731 --> 09:45.566
¶ Oh what fun it is
to ride in a one ¶

09:45.586 --> 09:46.643
- [Erin] Uh oh.

09:46.645 --> 09:47.977
- [Carter] That's not the words.

09:47.996 --> 09:49.421
- The presents.

09:49.572 --> 09:50.922
- You gotta get them, mom.

09:59.749 --> 10:01.433
- What am I gonna do?

10:02.344 --> 10:03.435
Ugh, they're everywhere.

10:09.258 --> 10:11.234
Oh, no, no, no, don't
run over the gifts.

10:16.599 --> 10:18.116
Thank you so much for stopping.

10:19.102 --> 10:21.511
Hi, sorry about this.

10:21.529 --> 10:23.029
- Same thing happened
to me one time,

10:23.106 --> 10:25.606
except there was a queen size
mattress on the interstate.

10:25.626 --> 10:26.941
- [Erin] Oh wow,

10:27.018 --> 10:29.535
looks like we could both
use a knot tying class.

10:29.688 --> 10:32.522
- Hey!

10:32.540 --> 10:33.465
Where are you ladies headed?

10:35.043 --> 10:37.118
- Sorry, who were you?

10:37.137 --> 10:37.969
- Mateo.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.046
Need some help?

10:40.123 --> 10:42.790
- Thanks Mateo, but I, I
think I can handle this.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.477
- Well, I mean we can't
really go anywhere

10:45.553 --> 10:48.730
until we're all picked
up, so I'll just help you.

10:50.466 --> 10:51.983
- Farrah is expecting
us for dinner soon

10:52.060 --> 10:53.443
and we're going to be late.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.045
- Are you Gary's daughter?

10:56.064 --> 10:56.804
- Yeah.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.323
You know my dad?

10:58.400 --> 11:00.141
- Yeah.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.161
Him and Farrah come down to
my restaurant pretty regular.

11:03.312 --> 11:04.554
He'd been bragging about

11:04.572 --> 11:06.414
his grandkids coming to
visit him for Christmas.

11:07.726 --> 11:08.958
- Hi, I'm Erin.

11:10.395 --> 11:11.127
- Erin.

11:13.823 --> 11:15.173
Well hey why don't I um,

11:15.324 --> 11:16.900
why don't I load up the
truck with the presents

11:16.918 --> 11:18.159
and I just follow you over?

11:18.178 --> 11:20.904
- Oh, thank you but
I'm really okay.

11:20.922 --> 11:23.264
I think I can handle this.

11:27.412 --> 11:29.854
- All right, okay.

11:29.931 --> 11:30.914
Let's you know what?

11:30.932 --> 11:32.857
Let's, let's load up the truck.

11:33.009 --> 11:34.693
I got a lot of space.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.028
- Yes, thank you.

11:37.105 --> 11:38.421
That would be great.

11:38.440 --> 11:40.198
- Oh, Merry Christmas,
that's heavy.

11:40.349 --> 11:41.116
- Thank you.

11:42.093 --> 11:43.368
- You're welcome.

11:50.193 --> 11:51.358
- Is that man a cowboy?

11:52.287 --> 11:54.771
- Why did you let him
take our presents?

11:54.789 --> 11:57.048
- He's just helping us
take then to Grandee's.

11:57.125 --> 11:59.366
- Then he's the handsome cowboy

11:59.386 --> 12:01.611
and we're the
damsels in distress.

12:01.629 --> 12:03.221
- We are not
damsels in distress.

12:03.298 --> 12:05.706
We are very capable women
who've just unexpectedly

12:05.726 --> 12:06.808
changed our game plan.

12:08.729 --> 12:11.312
He does look a
little like a cowboy.

12:12.457 --> 12:13.189
- Cowboy.

12:17.979 --> 12:18.737
- Here we go.

12:19.722 --> 12:21.906
¶ Jingle bells, jingle bells ¶

12:21.983 --> 12:25.635
¶ Jingle all the way ¶

12:25.637 --> 12:28.872
(upbeat country music)

12:38.241 --> 12:41.509
(upbeat country music)

12:49.436 --> 12:52.270
- There they are!

12:52.347 --> 12:53.271
Hello you!

12:57.519 --> 12:58.443
- Grandee!

12:59.929 --> 13:00.779
- [Greg] Hey you wild cats,
come give Grandee a hug.

13:00.855 --> 13:03.114
- Look at you girls!

13:03.266 --> 13:05.200
Oh, look at you.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.620
Come here you little munchkin,
duck underneath there.

13:08.696 --> 13:10.271
- Hey, did you guys get
yourself a Santa Claus

13:10.290 --> 13:11.531
to hand out your presents?

13:11.607 --> 13:13.774
- She almost lost all
of them out on route 55.

13:13.794 --> 13:15.794
- I tied them to
the top of the car.

13:15.945 --> 13:18.630
- [Farrah] Mateo, you are
a Knight in shining armor.

13:19.782 --> 13:20.706
- Thank you.

13:20.859 --> 13:22.217
- Handsome gentlemen
and he's single.

13:25.621 --> 13:26.805
- Ah.

13:26.956 --> 13:28.214
- Oh you okay?

13:28.366 --> 13:29.623
- Yeah, yeah.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.534
It's just a bum shoulder.

13:31.536 --> 13:33.144
High school football souvenir.

13:34.205 --> 13:35.814
- Well, make sure you hold
it with your whole hand

13:35.965 --> 13:37.315
and not just your fingers.

13:37.466 --> 13:39.818
Keep it close to your body,
don't overextend your arms.

13:39.894 --> 13:41.736
It'll put more
pressure on your back.

13:43.306 --> 13:45.214
Sorry, I am an
occupational therapist

13:45.233 --> 13:47.141
so it's force of habit.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.159
- I don't mind a bit.

13:52.574 --> 13:54.057
- Hey Gary.

13:54.059 --> 13:55.583
- I'm so glad you're here, baby.

13:57.062 --> 13:57.794
- Me too.

13:59.247 --> 14:01.840
- You saved us from a
Christmas or nothing but rocks.

14:01.916 --> 14:03.341
- Hey, the least I could do.

14:03.492 --> 14:04.676
- You didn't bring
me tamales, did you?

14:04.827 --> 14:06.402
- Ah, all out for today.

14:07.255 --> 14:09.906
- Mateo here owns
the Verdosa Cocina.

14:09.908 --> 14:11.165
Best tamales in town.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.852
- Oh, you're the tamale king?

14:13.928 --> 14:17.413
- Yeah, I, I didn't know they
were going to call me that

14:17.432 --> 14:18.523
in the article.

14:18.674 --> 14:20.692
- They ranked your
top tamale in Texas.

14:20.768 --> 14:24.195
- Well um, hey you should come
on down to the restaurant.

14:24.347 --> 14:25.755
We'll give you
the VIP treatment.

14:25.773 --> 14:29.117
Here, this has
the address on it.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.870
- Thanks.

14:32.021 --> 14:32.871
Okay.

14:32.947 --> 14:33.930
- Okay.

14:33.948 --> 14:35.373
- [Mateo] Okay.

14:35.524 --> 14:36.857
- Let me give you a hand with
the rest of those presents.

14:36.877 --> 14:38.601
- All the presents were
safe and sound in the house,

14:38.620 --> 14:40.194
but you know what?

14:40.213 --> 14:42.105
I should probably
head back to work.

14:42.123 --> 14:43.715
Dina's up to her
eyeballs in masa

14:43.866 --> 14:47.110
so you folks have a
good night and uh,

14:47.128 --> 14:48.202
it was really nice meeting you.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.721
- Well, thank you again.

14:49.797 --> 14:50.638
- Yeah.

14:51.966 --> 14:53.391
- Good seeing you.

14:55.044 --> 14:56.227
- Can I help you unload?

14:57.956 --> 14:58.730
- I've got it.

15:01.809 --> 15:04.986
(subtle country music)

15:13.638 --> 15:16.139
- Where's those squirmy
grandkids of mine?

15:16.157 --> 15:18.641
- Well, they were driving us
crazy begging to see the goats.

15:18.660 --> 15:23.146
so Farrah took them out to find
pine cones for her projects.

15:23.164 --> 15:24.163
- You know, I've been trying

15:24.240 --> 15:25.256
to pull that tree
stump out of there

15:25.408 --> 15:27.316
for a couple of weeks now.

15:27.335 --> 15:28.593
- But you decided to do it now?

15:28.670 --> 15:31.337
- Well Curtis lent me
his back hoe for the day.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.915
- You promised them that they
get to feed the baby goats.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.351
- And they will.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.521
- Please don't
disappoint them, okay?

15:42.350 --> 15:43.691
- I will take them.

15:49.357 --> 15:50.782
I'm going to go wash up.

15:52.860 --> 15:55.870
(subtle piano music)

16:04.372 --> 16:07.131
- [Peyton] It's everywhere.

16:07.208 --> 16:10.969
Mom doesn't let us have
glitter in the house.

16:11.120 --> 16:12.119
- Oh, don't worry.

16:12.138 --> 16:13.638
She and I made a
deal that it's okay

16:13.715 --> 16:15.473
if all the glitter
stays at my house.

16:18.870 --> 16:20.961
- [Carter] But how do the
baby goats know who they are

16:20.981 --> 16:22.371
if they don't have names?

16:22.390 --> 16:24.148
- Well, I guess they just know.

16:24.225 --> 16:25.483
- But how?

16:25.634 --> 16:27.968
- Well, I never really
thought about it.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.988
- They have to have names
'cause what if they get lost

16:30.139 --> 16:31.990
and we have to call them home?

16:33.218 --> 16:36.953
- Hm, well you'll just
have to name them I guess.

16:39.982 --> 16:41.749
- This one is Coco.

16:45.154 --> 16:46.562
- And who's that?

16:46.581 --> 16:48.731
- [Carter] And she's Marshmallow
'cause she's all white.

16:48.750 --> 16:51.134
I think this one's Licorice.

16:52.086 --> 16:53.402
- Are they all named after food?

16:53.421 --> 16:54.178
- Of course.

17:05.933 --> 17:07.358
- All right.

17:07.510 --> 17:09.252
How'd you ladies like to help
me wash up the dinner dishes

17:09.270 --> 17:10.844
for my loving bride?

17:10.864 --> 17:12.513
- Okay Grandee.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.423
- Okay, let's start,
come here you.

17:14.425 --> 17:16.159
- Okay, y'all wash and I'll dry.

17:17.186 --> 17:20.371
(subtle country music)

17:31.384 --> 17:32.699
- Can I give Eggnog her bottle?

17:32.719 --> 17:33.718
- You sure can.

17:33.795 --> 17:34.886
- And can I give
her the next one?

17:35.037 --> 17:35.845
- You bet.

17:36.964 --> 17:37.722
- Shotgun!

17:37.799 --> 17:39.223
- I called the next shotgun.

17:39.375 --> 17:40.725
- Oh you didn't.

17:40.802 --> 17:41.967
- Hey, you need to wrap up.

17:42.120 --> 17:44.545
I don't want you getting
another sore throat.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.621
- Thanks mom.

17:45.640 --> 17:46.789
- You want to come with us?

17:46.791 --> 17:48.048
- I was going to take a walk.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.067
- Aw.

17:49.218 --> 17:51.402
- Come on, you
can meet Licorice.

17:51.479 --> 17:53.738
If you rub her belly,
she falls asleep.

17:55.466 --> 17:56.199
- Please mom.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.078
- Okay.

18:00.229 --> 18:01.412
- Yay!

18:01.564 --> 18:04.665
(upbeat country music)

18:09.831 --> 18:12.090
(cheering)

18:22.176 --> 18:24.160
- You got that bottle, Peyton?

18:24.178 --> 18:25.436
- Uh huh.

18:25.588 --> 18:27.438
- [Gary] Okay, I
bet she's hungry.

18:27.515 --> 18:28.272
- Come on.

18:35.782 --> 18:36.614
- There you go.

18:37.842 --> 18:38.574
- Oh, hi.

18:39.861 --> 18:40.952
Oh, it's okay.

18:43.272 --> 18:44.956
Hi, oh she's so sweet.

18:45.107 --> 18:48.517
- Yeah, they tend to get
a bit ornery sometimes.

18:48.536 --> 18:50.461
But Farrah loves having
them little critters around

18:50.613 --> 18:53.131
till they start
eating your begonias.

18:53.207 --> 18:54.615
- What's this one's name?

18:55.710 --> 19:00.555
- Oh, that one is either
Marshmallow or Whip Cream.

19:05.628 --> 19:08.146
- Is that goat for put the
baby down and back away?

19:09.891 --> 19:11.891
- Oh, that's old Luna Belle.

19:12.043 --> 19:13.876
You guys best be
careful around her.

19:13.895 --> 19:15.378
She has a tendency to
nibble at your back side

19:15.380 --> 19:16.821
if you rub her the wrong way.

19:18.232 --> 19:20.491
- Well, I prefer to keep
my backside in one piece.

19:20.643 --> 19:21.717
- Aw, come on.

19:21.719 --> 19:23.286
Where's your sense of adventure?

19:24.389 --> 19:26.122
- Hiding behind my
aversion to pain.

19:27.816 --> 19:29.392
- That was just goat kisses.

19:29.394 --> 19:30.835
- Well, I'm going
to go for my walk.

19:30.912 --> 19:32.728
Girls, listen to Grandee, okay?

19:32.747 --> 19:33.504
- Okay.

19:37.326 --> 19:39.135
- Hey girls, what do we got?

19:44.926 --> 19:47.185
(laughter)

19:53.935 --> 19:57.153
(upbeat country music)

20:01.776 --> 20:03.201
- Hey.

20:03.352 --> 20:04.443
- Oh, hey you.

20:04.595 --> 20:06.095
I was just picking
up some pecans

20:06.113 --> 20:07.279
for my Christmas fruitcake.

20:07.432 --> 20:08.164
- Ah.

20:10.284 --> 20:13.044
- Your daddy is so happy that
you and the girls are here.

20:14.363 --> 20:15.129
- I'm glad.

20:16.216 --> 20:17.381
- He'd love to see
them more often,

20:17.533 --> 20:19.800
he talks about those
girls all the time.

20:22.296 --> 20:23.888
- Things just get so crazy.

20:25.374 --> 20:27.800
- But you made it
home for Christmas.

20:27.952 --> 20:29.810
- Well, the girls
wouldn't let me say no.

20:31.806 --> 20:34.381
I didn't mean it like that.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.652
It just gets complicated
with me and my dad sometimes.

20:40.222 --> 20:43.649
- Your daddy hasn't always
been the most available,

20:44.635 --> 20:46.077
missing out on
spending time with you

20:46.153 --> 20:47.536
has been his biggest regret.

20:50.566 --> 20:52.833
- Well, he's really
good with the girls.

20:54.236 --> 20:55.644
- Sometimes being a grandparent

20:55.646 --> 20:57.571
is easier than being a parent.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.382
All the perks, none
of the pressure.

21:01.910 --> 21:02.927
- I guess that's true.

21:04.839 --> 21:07.598
- Well, I better get these
back up to the house,

21:07.675 --> 21:10.175
those fruit cakes
won't bake themselves.

21:10.328 --> 21:11.060
- Okay.

21:20.338 --> 21:24.189
¶ Deck the halls
with bells of holly ¶

21:24.342 --> 21:28.244
¶ Fa la la la la
la la la la la ¶

21:32.533 --> 21:33.457
- Okay, goofy girls.

21:33.609 --> 21:34.775
Last call for the sleep train.

21:34.794 --> 21:35.776
Come on, let's go.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.036
- [Carter] We have
lots of energy

21:37.188 --> 21:39.038
'cause Grandee gave
us candy canes.

21:39.190 --> 21:40.131
Sugar, sugar!

21:42.877 --> 21:44.376
- Sugar rush.

21:44.529 --> 21:46.378
- Well, you're going to have
to take your sugar rush to bed.

21:46.531 --> 21:47.530
Come on, I gotta go.

21:47.548 --> 21:49.882
- We want Grandee
to read us a story.

21:50.034 --> 21:51.550
- Please Grandee?

21:51.702 --> 21:53.218
- Grandee's busy.

21:53.371 --> 21:54.103
- I don't mind.

21:55.481 --> 21:57.148
- They're wild tonight.

21:57.299 --> 21:58.649
- I'll take it as a challenge.

21:59.635 --> 22:00.893
- Okay.

22:01.045 --> 22:01.877
- Yes.

22:01.896 --> 22:05.656
- All right, let's do it.

22:05.808 --> 22:10.786
Okay, now this is a story
about two little girls

22:14.000 --> 22:16.225
who got stuck in Santa's sleigh

22:16.243 --> 22:17.793
and ended up in the North Pole.

22:22.733 --> 22:25.801
Now, that was more
than 700 years ago.

22:30.999 --> 22:33.184
- Oh, going somewhere honey?

22:33.260 --> 22:35.853
- Oh, just going to grab a
few things for some brownies.

22:35.930 --> 22:37.813
- Oh, me pantry es sous pantry.

22:41.361 --> 22:43.936
- I was actually going to
try to find a coffee place.

22:44.088 --> 22:45.196
I don't have a
sitter very often,

22:45.272 --> 22:48.107
so thought I'd take a
few minutes to myself.

22:48.259 --> 22:50.092
- Oh, well I don't know
where you gonna find coffee

22:50.111 --> 22:51.202
in Ellington this late.

22:57.768 --> 23:00.878
(upbeat country music)

23:21.550 --> 23:23.901
(bell rings)

23:26.631 --> 23:29.740
(subtle country music)

23:48.653 --> 23:53.556
¶ Stack your plates
with fresh tamales ¶

23:54.767 --> 23:58.769
¶ Santa ate well
now he's jolly ¶

24:01.849 --> 24:04.442
(giggling)

24:04.593 --> 24:06.760
- How long have you been here?

24:06.779 --> 24:09.613
- I didn't know those were
the words to that song.

24:10.599 --> 24:12.950
- To be fair, I kind of
made up that last part.

24:13.027 --> 24:14.785
- It was really
good, I'm impressed.

24:17.105 --> 24:17.913
- Thank you.

24:20.685 --> 24:22.918
I would love to make good on
my promise of a tamale feast,

24:25.465 --> 24:28.924
but we just sold out and
the kitchen is closed.

24:29.860 --> 24:30.542
- No problem.

24:30.695 --> 24:31.802
You still got any coffee?

24:32.788 --> 24:33.596
- That I can do.

24:34.865 --> 24:35.598
Be right back.

24:42.130 --> 24:44.556
- Hey, who are you
talking to out there?

24:44.709 --> 24:45.441
- Customer.

24:48.062 --> 24:49.302
- Pretty customer.

24:49.322 --> 24:51.655
I guess that explains
the after hours service.

24:53.217 --> 24:54.233
- That's Gary Burns's daughter.

24:54.385 --> 24:55.618
- Oh she is.

24:56.979 --> 24:59.238
- She read the article
in the Texas Traveler.

24:59.390 --> 25:01.999
I told her to drop
by, try some tamales.

25:05.153 --> 25:06.319
- You know what?

25:06.339 --> 25:08.005
I just remembered, I
forgot to feed the dog.

25:09.233 --> 25:10.582
- When did you get a dog?

25:10.735 --> 25:11.675
- Just a teeny tiny dog.

25:11.827 --> 25:13.010
I may not have mentioned it.

25:13.087 --> 25:13.844
- What?

25:13.921 --> 25:16.180
- Yeah.
You know, anyways

25:16.331 --> 25:17.756
I'm sure that you've got
this all under control.

25:17.908 --> 25:19.683
So you don't mind if I just
pop out and take care of that?

25:19.760 --> 25:21.018
- You don't even like dogs.

25:21.169 --> 25:23.020
- I really do now.

25:23.097 --> 25:26.690
Especially the small ones,
they're just anyway have fun.

25:29.028 --> 25:31.862
(whimsical music)

25:42.691 --> 25:44.542
- Thanks for helping
out with those.

25:44.618 --> 25:46.026
- Yeah.

25:46.045 --> 25:48.712
Thanks for letting me hang
out here for a little while.

25:48.789 --> 25:51.790
It's getting kind of
claustrophobic at the ranch.

25:51.942 --> 25:53.050
- No worries.

25:53.201 --> 25:55.277
- Christmas can be a lot, right?

25:55.296 --> 25:58.389
- Yeah, busiest
time of year for us.

25:58.540 --> 26:00.224
- Oh yeah, Christmas tamales.

26:00.375 --> 26:03.727
- I usually don't see the
light of day until January 1st.

26:07.792 --> 26:09.358
- So do you do this a lot?

26:11.887 --> 26:14.029
- What, salt shakers?

26:15.966 --> 26:18.909
- Invite women over
to your restaurant

26:18.986 --> 26:23.080
and woo them with your
late night hospitality.

26:23.231 --> 26:24.248
- If I'm not mistaken,

26:24.399 --> 26:26.417
you've invited yourself
over at this hour

26:26.568 --> 26:28.160
and as for the hospitality,

26:28.312 --> 26:32.664
I don't tend to waste my
time usually with something,

26:32.817 --> 26:34.758
unless I'm really interested.

26:38.839 --> 26:39.597
- I see.

26:41.659 --> 26:44.893
(upbeat country music)

26:48.256 --> 26:52.501
¶ It's you ¶

26:52.519 --> 26:57.448
¶ Please let it be true ¶

26:58.433 --> 27:01.952
¶ Out of my dreams ¶

27:02.104 --> 27:06.957
¶ You have come alive ¶

27:10.129 --> 27:15.132
¶ I was down ¶

27:15.526 --> 27:20.471
¶ Eyes to the ground ¶

27:20.881 --> 27:25.200
¶ Till you came around ¶

27:25.219 --> 27:28.145
¶ Lifted me up high ¶

27:32.059 --> 27:35.560
- It's getting late, I
should probably head out.

27:36.547 --> 27:38.380
I wouldn't anyone
to worry about me.

27:38.399 --> 27:40.899
- I still owe you
some tamales though.

27:41.051 --> 27:42.785
- I'll hold you to it.

27:45.072 --> 27:45.829
Um,

27:47.892 --> 27:50.392
so I guess I'll see you soon.

27:50.411 --> 27:51.335
- The sooner, the better.

27:53.247 --> 27:54.004
- Bye.

27:59.161 --> 28:04.256
¶ What will I do ¶

28:04.408 --> 28:09.186
¶ If I'm without you ¶

28:10.022 --> 28:13.857
¶ Late in the night ¶

28:13.934 --> 28:17.361
¶ I'm off to say goodbye ¶

28:21.775 --> 28:23.158
- We were worried about you.

28:24.036 --> 28:24.868
- Geez.

28:26.597 --> 28:27.946
You nearly scared me to death.

28:28.098 --> 28:29.540
- I didn't mean to startle you.

28:31.285 --> 28:33.435
Where the heck did you go?

28:33.454 --> 28:35.454
- I just went for a drive.

28:35.606 --> 28:37.289
- You left your phone.

28:37.441 --> 28:39.383
- I'm a grown woman dad.

28:39.534 --> 28:42.127
- Yeah, but we didn't have
any way to get a hold of you.

28:42.279 --> 28:44.513
- I'm home now daddy,
you can go to bed.

28:46.116 --> 28:48.116
- Oh uh, don't forget

28:48.135 --> 28:50.953
Farrah wants to take the
girls into town tomorrow

28:50.971 --> 28:52.730
for the Christmas market.

28:52.881 --> 28:53.689
- I won't.

28:55.717 --> 28:56.641
- Goodnight.

28:56.794 --> 28:57.717
- [Erin] Goodnight.

28:57.737 --> 29:01.980
¶ What can I do ¶

29:02.132 --> 29:06.910
¶ I kinda love you ¶

29:07.654 --> 29:12.583
¶ Kinda love you ¶

29:13.735 --> 29:16.420
¶ What will I do ¶

29:21.835 --> 29:37.516
(upbeat country music)

29:37.668 --> 29:40.778
(upbeat country music)

29:43.783 --> 29:45.282
- Let's go see the Santa.

29:45.433 --> 29:46.691
- Oh yeah.

29:46.844 --> 29:48.285
- We still have so
many presents to buy.

29:51.940 --> 29:53.181
We used to have one
of those Santa's.

29:54.201 --> 29:56.776
- Yeah, but Mom got rid of it
because she said

29:56.796 --> 29:59.463
it was following her around
all the time.

29:59.540 --> 30:00.964
- What?

30:01.116 --> 30:02.800
It's like those
paintings with the eye

30:02.951 --> 30:04.468
that follow you around the room.

30:05.379 --> 30:06.619
- Well look who it is?

30:06.639 --> 30:07.863
- Oh, hi Mateo.

30:07.865 --> 30:09.139
- Hey.

30:09.216 --> 30:10.365
Hey Erin.

30:10.367 --> 30:11.700
- Hi.

30:11.718 --> 30:12.976
- What you up to later on,

30:13.053 --> 30:15.053
you want to help me fill
up the salt shakers again?

30:15.205 --> 30:16.313
- Salt shakers?

30:18.300 --> 30:19.708
- You gonna pay
me the same rate?

30:19.726 --> 30:22.319
- Luke warm coffee,
you got a deal.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.989
- So that's where
you were last night.

30:26.141 --> 30:26.824
Ow.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.328
- So, what are you up to?

30:31.479 --> 30:32.996
- Oh, I just picked
up some presents

30:33.073 --> 30:36.149
and now I'm headed uptown to
drop off these mail orders.

30:36.168 --> 30:38.410
- [Farrah] You know Mateo,
your timing is perfect.

30:38.562 --> 30:40.412
The girls and I need to
pick out a Christmas present

30:40.564 --> 30:41.654
for their mama.

30:41.674 --> 30:42.914
Maybe you could take
her to the post office

30:43.067 --> 30:45.158
and get her out of our
hair for a few minutes.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.585
- What's Erin gonna
do at the post office?

30:46.737 --> 30:47.469
Ow.

30:49.164 --> 30:49.972
You mind?

30:51.333 --> 30:53.016
- No, not at all, not at all.

30:54.169 --> 30:54.852
- I don't mind either.

30:54.928 --> 30:56.261
- Didn't figure you would.

30:56.413 --> 30:58.096
Come on gals, let's play Santa.

30:58.248 --> 31:00.006
- Yay, let's go play Santa.

31:00.025 --> 31:01.507
- See you later.

31:01.527 --> 31:02.359
- Bye.

31:03.770 --> 31:06.922
- Just, it's just this
way past the church booth.

31:06.940 --> 31:08.866
- Can I carry one
of those for you?

31:09.017 --> 31:10.701
- Yeah, sure thanks.

31:10.777 --> 31:11.535
- Oh wow.

31:13.021 --> 31:16.373
What a pretty nativity,
it's so detailed.

31:16.524 --> 31:18.524
- First Church of Ellington
bought this nativity

31:18.544 --> 31:20.711
75 years ago.

31:21.622 --> 31:23.171
It's a big tradition
around here.

31:24.532 --> 31:25.716
- Where's the baby Jesus?

31:27.127 --> 31:28.886
- Oh, they don't put the
baby in until Christmas Eve.

31:29.037 --> 31:31.221
They have this really
wonderful holiday service

31:31.298 --> 31:34.558
down at the church, everybody
holds candles and sings.

31:38.288 --> 31:40.397
- It sounds so beautiful.

31:40.548 --> 31:42.190
- Yeah, it really is.

31:43.310 --> 31:46.236
You gonna be here to see it?

31:46.388 --> 31:48.813
- We're staying
through Christmas.

31:48.966 --> 31:49.698
- Great.

31:56.140 --> 31:58.916
- What time does the
post office close today?

31:59.067 --> 32:00.918
- I forgot we were on a mission.

32:01.069 --> 32:01.919
Follow me.

32:05.165 --> 32:06.882
You better get that
last minute shopping in.

32:08.001 --> 32:11.653
- Oh, did you get all
your parcels mailed?

32:11.672 --> 32:14.598
- Yes ma'am, last
batch is on its way.

32:14.749 --> 32:16.675
- Did the girls get
me something good?

32:16.827 --> 32:18.343
- Maybe, it's a secret.

32:18.495 --> 32:19.844
Gary and the girls are
waiting in the car.

32:19.997 --> 32:21.587
We should probably go.

32:21.607 --> 32:22.940
- Okay, well.

32:23.016 --> 32:27.110
- I made my famous
Christmas fruit cake, Mateo.

32:27.262 --> 32:28.336
Why don't you come over later

32:28.338 --> 32:30.172
and celebrate with
a slice or three?

32:31.191 --> 32:33.075
- I should really head
back to the restaurant.

32:33.953 --> 32:35.786
- So around three o'clock then?

32:37.605 --> 32:40.198
- Who am I to say no to
your famous fruit cake?

32:40.350 --> 32:41.183
I'll be there.

32:41.201 --> 32:43.293
- Best fruit cake you ever had.

32:43.445 --> 32:45.203
- All right, see you then.

32:45.355 --> 32:46.463
- See you then.

32:53.530 --> 32:56.640
(upbeat country music)

33:01.054 --> 33:02.037
- Hey.

33:02.055 --> 33:03.939
Thanks for stopping by.

33:10.731 --> 33:12.397
Hey Dee, what's the scoop?

33:12.549 --> 33:15.475
- Hey, we are already sold
out of the adobo tamales

33:15.494 --> 33:17.402
and we're low on
beans and cheese.

33:17.554 --> 33:19.496
- Christmas rush has
officially started.

33:19.647 --> 33:23.225
- Uh huh, I put some
husks in the sink to soak.

33:23.227 --> 33:24.334
- All right, I'll clean them.

33:24.411 --> 33:26.061
- No, you will not.

33:26.079 --> 33:28.079
You were here half the night
prepping the mail orders.

33:28.232 --> 33:30.990
I will do the husks, just
deal with the take out.

33:31.010 --> 33:33.010
- Thanks, you are best.

33:33.086 --> 33:38.015
Can you, can you hold down
the fort later this afternoon?

33:39.743 --> 33:40.475
I have a thing.

33:41.428 --> 33:42.310
- A thing?

33:43.838 --> 33:45.764
You don't have things,
you practically live here.

33:45.916 --> 33:47.357
What thing?

33:47.509 --> 33:49.151
- It's just a thing.

33:50.587 --> 33:53.363
- Oh, you have a thing
with Ms. Saltshaker.

33:53.515 --> 33:55.924
- Okay, first of all, you
know her name is Erin.

33:55.942 --> 33:58.368
Second of all,
Farrah invited me.

33:58.445 --> 34:02.039
Third of all, we're
having fruitcake.

34:02.190 --> 34:04.499
- Fruitcake, sounds serious.

34:05.786 --> 34:08.270
- Look, if you can't do
it, I'll just tell them.

34:08.288 --> 34:09.546
- Oh, no, no, no.

34:09.697 --> 34:10.380
I can do it.

34:11.866 --> 34:13.458
- Thank you.

34:13.610 --> 34:17.387
- I will just be expecting
more details very soon.

34:21.618 --> 34:22.684
- Got your order, sir.

34:24.288 --> 34:25.062
- Hi.

34:26.047 --> 34:29.958
(upbeat country music)

34:29.976 --> 34:32.294
- Nice little winter
rain rainstorm.

34:32.296 --> 34:34.196
- Ah, just pretend
it's melted snowflakes.

34:38.393 --> 34:39.576
This looks like a good one.

34:39.727 --> 34:41.078
- I haven't done this in ages.

34:41.229 --> 34:43.972
- Well the difference is you
used to shimmy up the tree.

34:45.142 --> 34:48.418
- Yeah, well I think my tree
shimmying days are over.

34:54.927 --> 34:58.670
- I told Farrah I'd give her
500 feet of fake mistletoe

34:58.822 --> 35:01.098
and spring it around the
whole house if she wanted.

35:01.249 --> 35:04.101
She said nope, had
to be the real thing.

35:05.495 --> 35:06.752
You got this?

35:06.772 --> 35:07.604
- Yeah.

35:09.666 --> 35:11.775
- Pretty good with this ladder.

35:11.852 --> 35:16.521
Might have to get you
to prune my peach trees.

35:16.673 --> 35:18.523
- Well, I've been
handling all the yard work

35:18.675 --> 35:20.024
at the house now.

35:20.177 --> 35:21.176
- Yeah, it can't be easy

35:21.178 --> 35:22.410
raising those two
girls by yourself.

35:24.272 --> 35:25.122
- We're doing okay.

35:26.700 --> 35:29.960
- Well Farrah and I, we'd like
to pitch in if you let us.

35:30.036 --> 35:31.628
- Just enjoy being
a fun grandpa.

35:33.690 --> 35:35.465
- Well, I want to be
there for you too.

35:39.212 --> 35:39.970
- Bombs away.

35:43.958 --> 35:46.643
(doorbell rings)

35:50.390 --> 35:51.464
- Hey you.

35:51.483 --> 35:52.390
- Hi.

35:52.542 --> 35:53.441
- Long time no see.

35:57.823 --> 35:59.156
You look great.

35:59.232 --> 35:59.990
- So do you.

36:02.052 --> 36:04.235
I um, I got some pozole.

36:04.388 --> 36:06.329
- Ah, this smells
amazing, thank you.

36:07.391 --> 36:09.557
Mateo brought us pozole.

36:09.576 --> 36:13.319
- Oh, bless you Mateo, saves
me from cooking dinner.

36:13.338 --> 36:16.398
I swear these children insist
eating three meals a day.

36:17.176 --> 36:18.175
- Thanks for having
me over, Farrah.

36:19.252 --> 36:20.844
- Do you want to sit?

36:20.921 --> 36:23.180
- Yeah, don't mind if I do.

36:29.671 --> 36:32.189
- May I offer you a
piece of fruit cake?

36:33.417 --> 36:36.359
- I would love a
piece of fruit cake.

36:36.511 --> 36:40.030
- If you don't like the raisins,
you can just pick them out.

36:40.106 --> 36:40.989
- Gotcha.

36:42.517 --> 36:45.827
- [Peyton] Would you like some
nut mug with your egg nog?

36:46.763 --> 36:48.205
- Don't you mean nutmeg?

36:48.356 --> 36:49.539
- Isn't it nut mug?

36:49.691 --> 36:51.783
'Cause you just
sprinkle it in your mug?

36:51.935 --> 36:53.210
- That does make more
sense, doesn't it?

36:53.361 --> 36:57.214
Yes, yes, I would
love some nut mug.

36:57.365 --> 36:58.215
Thank you.

37:01.703 --> 37:02.886
- Did you make this?

37:03.037 --> 37:04.512
It tastes just like grandma's.

37:05.390 --> 37:07.057
- Why thank you, darling.

37:07.208 --> 37:08.225
I sure did.

37:08.301 --> 37:09.451
- You and Grandee
have the same stars

37:09.469 --> 37:10.393
on the top of your trees.

37:13.123 --> 37:15.398
- That's nice that you
keep the tradition.

37:15.550 --> 37:18.126
- Ah, the Christmas tree just
looks all wrong without it.

37:18.144 --> 37:19.402
- What's the tradition?

37:20.405 --> 37:23.815
- Well, when my mama
and daddy got married,

37:23.967 --> 37:26.150
they didn't have any money to
by store bought decorations

37:26.303 --> 37:27.393
on their first Christmas

37:27.412 --> 37:30.580
and mama, she cut a star
out of a cereal box.

37:30.732 --> 37:32.749
She wrapped in tin foil.

37:32.900 --> 37:34.376
They kept that star for years.

37:35.737 --> 37:38.755
- We've had ours
forever, right mama?

37:38.906 --> 37:41.258
- I made ours when your
daddy and I got married.

37:41.409 --> 37:42.650
- And even when it wore out,

37:42.652 --> 37:45.745
instead of buying a
new fancy tree topper,

37:45.764 --> 37:47.597
mama just made
another tinfoil star

37:48.842 --> 37:51.059
and that's how the
tradition was born.

37:52.679 --> 37:55.013
- I like having a tradition.

37:55.165 --> 37:57.665
Someday, I'm going to
have a tinfoil star.

37:57.684 --> 37:58.566
- Me too.

38:01.187 --> 38:03.613
- Do you have any
family traditions?

38:03.690 --> 38:05.615
- Yup, yup I do

38:05.692 --> 38:07.784
because my mom was Filipino

38:07.935 --> 38:10.287
and my dad's family
was from Mexico,

38:10.438 --> 38:14.124
Mama wanted us to celebrate
both of our family's cultures.

38:14.275 --> 38:17.627
Every Christmas we would
celebrate with fairlitos.

38:18.946 --> 38:20.088
- What's fairlitos?

38:21.708 --> 38:23.633
- Well they're paper bags,

38:23.785 --> 38:25.543
it's a Filipino and
Mexican tradition.

38:25.695 --> 38:28.212
You get to cut these
pretty designs in them

38:28.365 --> 38:30.956
and then put a candle inside

38:30.976 --> 38:33.201
and then place them
all along the walkway

38:33.219 --> 38:35.053
leading up to your house.

38:35.205 --> 38:38.315
For us, it was just a way to
celebrate both of our cultures.

38:39.300 --> 38:41.484
- Can we make fairlitos?

38:41.561 --> 38:44.395
- [Farrah] I think I have
some lunch bags in the pantry.

38:44.548 --> 38:48.491
- Well, get ready to
see the master crafter

38:48.568 --> 38:50.160
and her proteges in action.

38:51.888 --> 38:54.998
(upbeat country music)

39:02.749 --> 39:05.967
(upbeat country music)

39:26.089 --> 39:29.199
(upbeat country music)

39:36.433 --> 39:37.165
- It's beautiful.

39:38.526 --> 39:39.209
- Isn't it?

39:42.622 --> 39:43.713
Sorry to duck out.

39:45.199 --> 39:47.125
I've got to head back to
work, give Dina a break,

39:47.277 --> 39:50.053
but tonight was a lot of fun.

39:50.130 --> 39:53.539
- Yeah, the kids love this.

39:53.558 --> 39:55.216
Looks like we have a
new family tradition.

39:56.043 --> 39:57.785
- I'm glad I got to share it.

39:57.787 --> 40:00.138
I haven't made
fairlitos in years.

40:00.290 --> 40:02.232
I'm always too busy
to even decorate.

40:02.308 --> 40:04.475
- I understand that
kind of craziness.

40:04.628 --> 40:07.028
When you have kids, there's
no taking Christmas off.

40:07.964 --> 40:10.298
- I bet.

40:10.316 --> 40:12.316
- Our first Christmas
after Jake died,

40:12.469 --> 40:15.370
I was still kind of a mess.

40:18.141 --> 40:21.709
- I heard about your
husband, I'm sorry Erin.

40:23.237 --> 40:23.920
- Thank you.

40:25.315 --> 40:26.047
Yeah, it was hard

40:27.500 --> 40:30.409
but I knew I needed to get
it together for those girls

40:30.429 --> 40:33.930
and there's something
about hanging lights

40:34.081 --> 40:36.599
and writing letters
to Santa Claus

40:36.751 --> 40:38.393
that doesn't let
you stay too sad.

40:40.755 --> 40:41.438
- That's true.

40:43.925 --> 40:46.109
- And I've learned to
be pretty independent.

40:48.095 --> 40:50.354
- You like things that way?

40:50.507 --> 40:55.118
- Yeah, mostly but sometimes
I think it would be nice

40:55.269 --> 40:57.787
to share it all with someone.

41:06.298 --> 41:09.466
I shouldn't keep you, I
know you have to go to work.

41:09.542 --> 41:10.300
- Yeah.

41:17.625 --> 41:19.701
Will I see you again though?

41:19.719 --> 41:20.602
- Yeah.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.271
- See you soon.

41:36.477 --> 41:39.662
(subtle country music)

42:08.009 --> 42:10.610
(phone ringing)

42:13.089 --> 42:15.365
- Good morning Tessa,
is everything okay?

42:15.516 --> 42:18.535
- [Tessa] Oh yes, I just
called the brag on myself.

42:19.687 --> 42:20.444
- [Erin] What'd you do?

42:20.597 --> 42:22.997
- I stacked 50 coins today.

42:24.025 --> 42:25.542
- Good job.

42:25.618 --> 42:27.877
- [Tessa] I also
called to check on you.

42:28.029 --> 42:29.771
- What for?

42:29.789 --> 42:31.047
- Well, I was just
thinking about

42:31.198 --> 42:32.382
what you said about your daddy

42:32.458 --> 42:34.801
and I think you should
call him for Christmas.

42:35.887 --> 42:38.203
- Well, believe it or not

42:38.223 --> 42:40.306
I'm staying here at
dad's with the girls.

42:41.451 --> 42:43.351
- Well, how's it going?

42:44.637 --> 42:47.730
- It's good, it's
a little weird.

42:49.550 --> 42:51.568
He's really trying,
but it's hard for me.

42:53.071 --> 42:54.404
- I know.

42:54.555 --> 42:56.814
Sometimes you can be standing
right next to someone

42:56.966 --> 42:59.300
and they still feel a
million miles apart.

43:00.561 --> 43:05.081
If you could just push your
heart open even a tiny crack,

43:05.232 --> 43:07.083
the light will
start creeping in.

43:09.570 --> 43:11.087
- Yeah, I'm pushing, I promise.

43:12.757 --> 43:17.093
- Well if I can stack
50 coins, you can do it.

43:20.006 --> 43:21.989
- Merry Christmas Tessa.

43:21.991 --> 43:23.766
- Merry Christmas sweetheart.

43:41.527 --> 43:42.619
- Hey, what are you doing?

43:42.770 --> 43:44.787
- We're making snowmen pancakes.

43:44.939 --> 43:47.014
- With bacon scarves.

43:47.033 --> 43:47.849
- Cool.

43:47.867 --> 43:49.016
Do you want my help?

43:49.035 --> 43:50.034
- Nope.

43:50.186 --> 43:52.019
Just sit down and
put your feet up.

43:52.021 --> 43:53.421
- Yeah, take a load off.

43:56.801 --> 43:57.800
- Can I have some more?

43:57.877 --> 43:59.469
I only grabbed two.

44:01.881 --> 44:03.364
- Morning darling.

44:03.383 --> 44:05.308
- I wanted to run
something by you, dad.

44:07.294 --> 44:08.269
- What you thinking?

44:09.706 --> 44:11.372
- Well, I've been considering
going back to school

44:11.391 --> 44:13.816
to get my PhD in
occupational therapy.

44:13.968 --> 44:15.376
- What about your job?

44:15.395 --> 44:19.046
- I'd still be working, but
it will let me specialize,

44:19.065 --> 44:20.990
maybe move into management,

44:21.067 --> 44:23.993
or I could even start
teaching at some point,

44:24.070 --> 44:28.313
but it's a lot of
time and so expensive.

44:28.333 --> 44:30.725
- Oh, you need money for school?

44:30.727 --> 44:32.317
- I wouldn't ask you for money

44:32.337 --> 44:33.836
- Farrah and I could pitch in.

44:33.988 --> 44:35.897
- Dad, I have the
money saved for school.

44:35.915 --> 44:38.174
I just wanted to see
what you thought.

44:39.660 --> 44:40.902
- Oh.

44:40.920 --> 44:42.069
- [Peyton] Breakfast is served.

44:42.088 --> 44:43.328
- Come on you two.

44:43.406 --> 44:45.431
These pancakes aren't
going to eat themselves.

44:46.409 --> 44:48.935
(subtle music)

44:57.678 --> 44:58.695
Come on in here.

45:02.108 --> 45:04.117
- Now, you can put
syrup but first

45:05.537 --> 45:06.786
you have to make it snow.

45:07.780 --> 45:09.263
- Dig in everybody.

45:09.282 --> 45:10.790
- Grandee, do you
want some snow?

45:11.876 --> 45:13.042
- I do.

45:13.194 --> 45:14.877
You bet I do.

45:15.029 --> 45:18.297
(upbeat country music)

45:34.807 --> 45:37.984
(upbeat country music)

45:46.244 --> 45:48.411
- You're a little early
for the lunch rush.

45:48.562 --> 45:49.245
- Oh, sorry.

45:49.396 --> 45:50.154
I can come back.

45:50.306 --> 45:52.640
- I'm just kidding, I'm Dina.

45:52.658 --> 45:53.833
- Hi, I'm Erin.

45:54.919 --> 45:56.477
- Well, nice to meet you.

45:56.496 --> 45:57.587
Mateo's in the kitchen.

45:59.758 --> 46:01.257
- I don't want to
get in his way.

46:01.408 --> 46:03.926
- I don't think you have
to worry about that at all.

46:04.929 --> 46:05.928
- Okay.

46:06.080 --> 46:07.430
Oh, thanks for running
things yesterday

46:07.507 --> 46:08.598
so Mateo could come over.

46:08.674 --> 46:10.099
- Are you kidding?

46:10.251 --> 46:11.342
Thank you for having him

46:11.494 --> 46:12.417
think about something
other than tamales

46:12.437 --> 46:13.728
for like an hour or two.

46:17.500 --> 46:18.608
Go save him from himself.

46:19.836 --> 46:20.777
- Okay, nice to meet you.

46:20.928 --> 46:21.736
- You too.

46:29.028 --> 46:30.745
- Dina, can you
pass me a poblano?

46:33.683 --> 46:34.439
- Hi.

46:34.459 --> 46:35.291
- Hey.

46:36.610 --> 46:37.627
- Hey.

46:37.778 --> 46:39.629
- Where did you learn
to cook like that?

46:39.705 --> 46:43.541
- My grandma, she
babysat me all the time.

46:43.693 --> 46:48.137
She said that if I was going
to take up space in her kitchen

46:48.289 --> 46:50.714
that I needed to work.

46:51.701 --> 46:54.869
She started me off
stirring the beans

46:54.871 --> 46:56.437
with his big old wooden spoon.

46:57.798 --> 46:59.148
I loved it.

46:59.225 --> 47:01.709
- I'm imagining you in
a tiny little chef hat.

47:01.727 --> 47:04.821
- I never stopped
cooking after that,

47:04.972 --> 47:08.549
Dina and I opened up a taco
truck right after high school.

47:08.568 --> 47:10.493
We hustled and we hustled

47:10.570 --> 47:14.121
and we saved up enough to
open up the storefront.

47:15.241 --> 47:16.223
The rest is history.

47:16.242 --> 47:18.835
- Wow, she's really nice.

47:18.911 --> 47:19.727
- Yeah.

47:19.745 --> 47:21.395
She's great, isn't she?

47:21.414 --> 47:23.005
- Yeah, honestly.

47:23.157 --> 47:25.232
Between the kids and work,

47:25.251 --> 47:28.419
I feel like I spend most of
my time with little girls

47:28.571 --> 47:30.012
and folks who could
be my grandparents.

47:30.164 --> 47:33.332
So it's nice to actually have
a conversation with someone

47:33.351 --> 47:36.352
who might've graduated high
school in the same decade as me.

47:37.504 --> 47:39.930
Oh, your bad shoulder?

47:40.083 --> 47:43.025
- Yeah, it only hits
me once in a while.

47:43.177 --> 47:45.152
But when it does, it's
a, it's a whopper.

47:46.606 --> 47:48.531
- Oh, here.

47:48.608 --> 47:51.701
Lay your hand flat on this.

47:52.853 --> 47:53.536
- Like that?

47:53.613 --> 47:54.929
- Yeah.

47:54.947 --> 47:57.114
- Are you gonna be cleaning?

47:57.266 --> 47:58.791
- Don't be a sassy patient,

48:00.861 --> 48:03.195
now slowly allow your
arm to move forward

48:03.214 --> 48:04.213
bending at the waist.

48:05.124 --> 48:06.799
- Oh, oh, all right.

48:08.294 --> 48:09.552
I feel that.

48:09.703 --> 48:11.445
- Yeah, it's a good stretch
for your rotator cuff,

48:11.464 --> 48:12.722
helps with range of motion.

48:15.635 --> 48:18.519
Do that everyday for a few
minutes and it should help.

48:21.882 --> 48:23.566
- I think you fixed me.

48:23.717 --> 48:24.483
You fixed me.

48:26.571 --> 48:28.070
Thanks.

48:28.147 --> 48:28.988
- Yeah.

48:34.728 --> 48:36.303
You're gonna burn your peppers.

48:36.322 --> 48:37.079
- What?

48:40.567 --> 48:41.417
- Oh shoot.

48:42.495 --> 48:44.670
(laughter)

48:50.002 --> 48:51.761
- I should probably head out,

48:51.912 --> 48:53.429
but I actually came to ask you

48:53.506 --> 48:56.933
if you would like to come
track reindeer with us today.

48:58.085 --> 49:00.919
- Track reindeer, you're gonna
need to explain that to me.

49:01.922 --> 49:04.848
- It's this thing my dad's
been doing since I was little.

49:05.777 --> 49:06.834
He goes out and
makes reindeer tracks

49:06.852 --> 49:08.444
and throws glitter around

49:08.595 --> 49:11.447
and puts a tape recorder in
the woods of jingle bells,

49:11.598 --> 49:13.449
stuff like that.

49:13.526 --> 49:16.786
Of course we never find any,
but the looking part's fun.

49:20.516 --> 49:21.515
- I have work.

49:21.517 --> 49:22.959
- Yeah, right.

49:23.110 --> 49:24.609
Of course.

49:24.629 --> 49:27.797
- But I can, I can ask Dina
to handle things for me again

49:27.948 --> 49:30.800
and we hire a couple of
helpers this time of year.

49:32.119 --> 49:33.302
- Are you sure
she wouldn't mind?

49:33.454 --> 49:35.196
- Yeah, she'd probably be
happy to get rid of me.

49:35.214 --> 49:40.142
- Okay, well then I guess
I'll see you in a little bit.

49:41.537 --> 49:42.627
- I'll be there.

49:42.647 --> 49:44.313
- Okay, okay.

49:44.465 --> 49:47.650
(upbeat country music)

50:02.391 --> 50:03.499
- Do you think we will see one?

50:03.650 --> 50:05.626
- I hope so, but I don't know.

50:06.653 --> 50:08.229
- I hope they're hungry.

50:08.231 --> 50:09.171
- Reindeer are always hungry.

50:09.323 --> 50:10.998
They need lots of
calories to fly.

50:11.917 --> 50:14.176
- Did you ever
find any reindeer?

50:14.328 --> 50:17.421
- I never saw any, but I
heard their jingle bells.

50:17.573 --> 50:18.514
Oh, I forgot my scarf.

50:18.665 --> 50:20.349
Can you watch for
when Mateo gets here?

50:25.431 --> 50:28.149
- Why do you think reindeer
like reindeer food so much?

50:29.435 --> 50:32.028
- I don't know, maybe
'cause it's sparkly.

50:33.847 --> 50:35.197
- I missed seeing you today.

50:35.349 --> 50:36.590
- I was in and out.

50:36.592 --> 50:40.261
- Erin, listen
about this morning.

50:40.279 --> 50:41.095
- Dad, it's fine.

50:41.113 --> 50:42.613
- No, it's not.

50:42.765 --> 50:43.522
It's not fine.

50:43.541 --> 50:44.373
You were upset.

50:45.434 --> 50:46.208
- I wasn't upset.

50:46.285 --> 50:48.952
I just wanted some advice.

50:49.105 --> 50:50.004
- Oh, okay.

50:55.035 --> 50:58.721
- Well, you went back to school
and you worked full time.

50:58.872 --> 50:59.963
But I was little then,

51:00.116 --> 51:03.350
so I just wanted to
know how you did it.

51:04.711 --> 51:07.063
- Well, you were
with your mom a lot.

51:11.051 --> 51:14.295
- Right, so you don't
think I can do it?

51:14.297 --> 51:16.072
- Well, I think you can do it.

51:16.223 --> 51:17.406
I think you can handle school.

51:17.483 --> 51:20.634
It'll be hard, but you've
always accomplished

51:20.653 --> 51:23.079
everything that you
set your mind to.

51:27.493 --> 51:30.920
- Mateo's here, let's
go catch a reindeer.

51:34.834 --> 51:35.758
- Okay then.

51:42.249 --> 51:43.657
- [Mateo] Stick these
in your pockets.

51:43.659 --> 51:45.676
Reindeer really like carrots.

51:45.828 --> 51:46.602
- Thank you.

51:48.088 --> 51:50.606
- Hi, I see you brought
some reindeer feed.

51:51.517 --> 51:52.566
- Did my research.

51:53.669 --> 51:55.611
- Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.

51:55.688 --> 51:56.946
We best get going.

51:57.022 --> 51:59.173
Farrah's' going to stay here

51:59.191 --> 52:01.951
and keep an eye on the
reindeer scanner for me.

52:02.102 --> 52:03.527
- Reindeer scanner?

52:03.679 --> 52:05.955
- Now the first thing
you've got to know

52:06.106 --> 52:09.792
about tracking reindeer,

52:09.943 --> 52:11.535
is they love the
scent of cookies.

52:11.687 --> 52:13.295
Go on, take one, go on.

52:15.875 --> 52:16.632
Mom?

52:18.118 --> 52:21.137
Rub that in real good,
rub it in your hands.

52:23.883 --> 52:26.142
Get it in there really good.

52:29.889 --> 52:32.439
Oh yeah, reindeer
can't resist that.

52:36.487 --> 52:38.136
- It's tradition.

52:38.156 --> 52:40.447
- Well, I ain't arguing
with tradition, so.

52:46.071 --> 52:46.954
Let's go tracking.

52:49.909 --> 52:51.392
- All right, y'all ready
to track some reindeer?

52:51.410 --> 52:52.409
- Yeah.

52:52.561 --> 52:53.335
- Let's go!

52:55.822 --> 52:59.008
(subtle country music)

53:05.408 --> 53:06.182
You hear that?

53:07.685 --> 53:09.092
- Jingle bells.

53:09.245 --> 53:10.352
- I can hear them too.

53:16.843 --> 53:17.860
- [Carter] I heard something.

53:18.011 --> 53:19.361
They might be in that bush.

53:19.438 --> 53:20.362
- Yeah.

53:20.514 --> 53:22.089
- Sprinkle a little
reindeer feed

53:22.091 --> 53:23.532
and then we can hide
behind the trees

53:23.609 --> 53:25.183
and see if any
reindeer come out.

53:25.203 --> 53:26.493
- Yeah, but do it quietly.

53:35.028 --> 53:37.379
- So will you spend
Christmas with your family?

53:38.365 --> 53:39.882
- No, Mom and dad are both gone.

53:40.867 --> 53:42.200
- I'm sorry.

53:42.220 --> 53:43.535
- It's all right, they
gave me their house

53:43.554 --> 53:45.721
so kind of feels like
they're still around.

53:47.466 --> 53:50.300
And my brother is all
the way out in El Paso,

53:50.453 --> 53:53.971
so usually I spent Christmas
over at Dina's house.

53:54.123 --> 53:55.622
- Oh really?

53:55.641 --> 53:57.882
- Yeah, she's got a huge family
of 10 brothers and sisters.

53:57.902 --> 53:58.734
- Oh wow.

54:00.053 --> 54:00.861
10.

54:01.888 --> 54:04.240
I'm not used to big Christmases.

54:04.316 --> 54:06.408
It's usually just me and
my mom and the girls.

54:08.153 --> 54:11.038
- Do you ever consider
expanding that list?

54:12.641 --> 54:13.749
- [Carter] Mateo!

54:13.826 --> 54:16.310
You have to come hide or
the reindeer won't come.

54:16.328 --> 54:17.828
- Yeah, come over here!

54:17.980 --> 54:18.712
- Be right there.

54:20.816 --> 54:23.926
(subtle country music)

54:42.671 --> 54:44.780
(laughter)

54:53.440 --> 54:54.915
- Oh here, let me help you.

54:58.129 --> 54:58.961
- Thanks.

55:00.447 --> 55:03.190
- Okay, go wash your
hands for dinner.

55:03.208 --> 55:04.207
- Okay.

55:04.360 --> 55:05.208
- Bye.

55:05.361 --> 55:06.043
- Bye.

55:06.195 --> 55:07.094
- I'll have it next time.

55:08.531 --> 55:10.881
- [Carter] You better.

55:11.033 --> 55:12.641
- Sorry we didn't
see any reindeer.

55:12.793 --> 55:14.051
- Maybe next year.

55:14.203 --> 55:16.219
- Is that an
official commitment?

55:16.372 --> 55:17.313
- Now it is, yes.

55:18.632 --> 55:20.107
- Oh, I have something for you.

55:26.215 --> 55:27.548
- What's this?

55:27.566 --> 55:28.973
- I made you something.

55:28.993 --> 55:31.401
It's brownies, it's the only
thing I know how to cook

55:31.554 --> 55:33.495
that doesn't come in a box.

55:33.572 --> 55:36.056
- Wow, well I consider
myself honored.

55:36.075 --> 55:37.891
Oh my God, these smell amazing.

55:37.910 --> 55:39.242
- Don't ruin your dinner,

55:39.395 --> 55:41.170
also please don't try
them in front of me

55:41.246 --> 55:42.412
in case you don't like them

55:42.565 --> 55:44.340
and that way I won't
die of embarrassment.

55:46.660 --> 55:47.676
- Thank you.

55:51.256 --> 55:52.497
You still have
some cookie crumb.

55:52.516 --> 55:53.849
- Oh my gosh.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.851
- All right, I got
it, or I smashed it.

55:58.522 --> 55:59.355
- Thanks.

56:03.268 --> 56:06.269
(phone chimes)

56:06.422 --> 56:07.679
- Let me just.

56:07.698 --> 56:09.089
- Duty calls?

56:09.108 --> 56:10.366
- Yeah, tis the season.

56:11.685 --> 56:12.701
See you soon?

56:12.778 --> 56:13.535
- Yeah.

56:15.689 --> 56:16.372
Keep dancing.

56:17.783 --> 56:19.616
- Ha ha.

56:19.768 --> 56:25.697
(upbeat country music)

56:25.716 --> 56:29.009
(upbeat country music)

56:38.971 --> 56:40.545
- So how was the
day with the girls?

56:40.564 --> 56:42.046
- It was good,

56:42.066 --> 56:44.066
we just picked up some firewood
for the bonfire tonight.

56:44.143 --> 56:46.217
- Yeah, it's going
to be a nice night.

56:46.237 --> 56:48.812
- You should call Mateo
and ask him to come.

56:48.964 --> 56:51.648
- He's taken so much
time off already.

56:51.800 --> 56:53.150
- Oh, come on.

56:53.226 --> 56:54.985
Something tells me he won't
mind taking a little more.

56:55.137 --> 56:57.395
Have you seen the
way he looks at you?

56:57.415 --> 56:58.247
- No.

57:00.251 --> 57:01.750
- I have known
that boy for years

57:01.827 --> 57:03.752
and he's never come
over for fruitcake

57:03.904 --> 57:05.754
and you know how good
my fruit cake is.

57:06.815 --> 57:07.756
- That's a good point.

57:09.334 --> 57:11.985
Maybe I'll just drive up there
and invite him in person.

57:11.987 --> 57:13.820
- Now you're talking.

57:13.822 --> 57:14.838
- Do you mind
watching the girls?

57:14.990 --> 57:16.657
- Not a bit, there's
plenty we can do.

57:16.675 --> 57:18.082
- Thanks.

57:18.102 --> 57:18.934
Wish me luck.

57:19.011 --> 57:19.768
- Good luck.

57:21.254 --> 57:23.513
- And your fruitcake
is really good.

57:23.666 --> 57:25.941
I don't even like fruitcake.

57:29.613 --> 57:32.448
- Hm, I've really
out done myself.

57:34.009 --> 57:37.119
(upbeat country music)

57:48.040 --> 57:49.298
- How can I help you ma'am?

57:50.617 --> 57:52.709
- Yeah, I'm looking
for some burnt peppers,

57:52.861 --> 57:53.760
you got any of those?

57:54.955 --> 57:57.139
- Only for my
special person list.

57:59.384 --> 58:01.977
- We're having a bonfire
tonight, Farrah invited you.

58:02.054 --> 58:04.221
- I wish you were the
one who was inviting me.

58:05.224 --> 58:07.149
- Well then I am
officially asking you

58:07.300 --> 58:09.818
to attend our family
holiday bonfire.

58:10.879 --> 58:13.471
- And I'm officially accepting.

58:13.491 --> 58:16.049
- I also realized I still
haven't tried your tamales.

58:16.068 --> 58:18.401
- Right, we can remedy
that right away.

58:18.554 --> 58:19.786
Meet me at our booth.

58:24.226 --> 58:24.908
- Hey.

58:25.060 --> 58:26.001
- Hey girl, how are you?

58:26.152 --> 58:26.910
- Good, how are you?

58:27.062 --> 58:27.744
- Awesome, thank you.

58:27.896 --> 58:29.838
Oh, I did try your brownies.

58:29.990 --> 58:32.991
It was a challenge to
get even a little piece

58:33.010 --> 58:34.325
out of your Mateo's hand,

58:34.345 --> 58:36.345
but he did let me try them
and they were delicious.

58:36.421 --> 58:37.346
- Thank you.

58:37.422 --> 58:38.180
- Nice to see you.

58:38.331 --> 58:39.014
- You too.

58:41.260 --> 58:45.503
- They were super delicious
and they're also all gone.

58:45.523 --> 58:46.504
- What?

58:46.524 --> 58:47.931
I just gave them
to you last night.

58:48.083 --> 58:48.932
- [Mateo] What can I say?

58:49.084 --> 58:50.025
I have a sweet tooth.

58:51.678 --> 58:55.489
Now, if you don't like
this, we can not be friends.

58:56.516 --> 59:01.495
- Okay.

59:03.690 --> 59:04.873
We can definitely
still be friends.

59:05.025 --> 59:06.024
What is this?

59:06.043 --> 59:07.525
- Chicken (speaking
Spanish) tamale.

59:07.545 --> 59:08.860
It's my specialty,

59:08.879 --> 59:11.271
my mom's chicken and
(speaking Spanish) recipe

59:11.273 --> 59:12.548
and my grandma's tamale.

59:12.624 --> 59:13.382
- It's so good.

59:15.294 --> 59:17.553
- You know, I bet your mom
would be really proud of you

59:17.704 --> 59:19.279
still keeping both
your traditions alive.

59:20.299 --> 59:24.351
- Yeah, well I hope to
pass them on someday.

59:28.473 --> 59:32.192
- Dina doesn't mind
me distracting you

59:33.629 --> 59:36.572
- Dina says that I don't
take enough breaks.

59:36.723 --> 59:40.576
She thinks that I don't leave
myself enough mental space

59:40.727 --> 59:44.079
to be creative and she's
been pretty philosophical

59:44.230 --> 59:45.581
since starting yoga.

59:49.478 --> 59:51.545
- Well, you do work a lot.

59:52.906 --> 59:55.832
- That's what it takes
to build the business.

59:55.984 --> 1:00:00.429
- Don't you have any hobbies
or places you wanna see?

1:00:00.505 --> 1:00:01.430
- Yeah.

1:00:01.581 --> 1:00:03.432
Once in a while I
like to go fishing

1:00:03.508 --> 1:00:07.160
and whatever we catch,
we put it on the menu.

1:00:07.179 --> 1:00:08.495
- There's gotta be
something you like

1:00:08.497 --> 1:00:09.730
that isn't work related.

1:00:12.835 --> 1:00:13.775
- I like you.

1:00:16.171 --> 1:00:16.903
- I like you too.

1:00:22.786 --> 1:00:24.745
- I also like two step.

1:00:27.774 --> 1:00:28.790
How about you?

1:00:30.686 --> 1:00:32.628
- Like every self
respecting Texas girl.

1:00:33.856 --> 1:00:36.965
(upbeat country music)

1:00:58.714 --> 1:01:00.322
(phone ringing)

1:01:00.473 --> 1:01:01.882
- [Mom] You're
lucky you caught me.

1:01:01.900 --> 1:01:04.901
Phil and I have been
in the pool all day.

1:01:05.053 --> 1:01:06.553
- Any news?

1:01:06.555 --> 1:01:08.646
- Well, he proposed last night

1:01:08.666 --> 1:01:12.793
on the beach under the
stars, it was like a movie.

1:01:13.987 --> 1:01:17.321
- Oh mom, I'm so happy for you.

1:01:17.341 --> 1:01:21.176
- So I guess we will be
planning a spring wedding.

1:01:21.327 --> 1:01:22.803
Will you be my maid of honor?

1:01:24.181 --> 1:01:26.139
- Oh mom, of course I will.

1:01:27.351 --> 1:01:29.592
- I am so excited.

1:01:29.745 --> 1:01:31.745
Well we've been talking
about me this whole time.

1:01:31.763 --> 1:01:32.929
What about you?

1:01:33.081 --> 1:01:34.764
- Well, don't get too excited

1:01:34.917 --> 1:01:39.085
but I think I may
have met someone.

1:01:39.087 --> 1:01:39.861
- A man?

1:01:40.923 --> 1:01:42.197
- No, a unicorn.

1:01:42.274 --> 1:01:43.323
Yes, a man.

1:01:44.760 --> 1:01:47.869
He owns a restaurant in
town and he's really nice.

1:01:47.946 --> 1:01:50.931
He's come over a few times
and he's great with the girls.

1:01:50.949 --> 1:01:52.165
- Aw, good for you honey.

1:01:53.359 --> 1:01:54.284
Now I want details.

1:01:55.528 --> 1:01:57.713
- Well, that's all the
details I have for now.

1:01:57.789 --> 1:01:58.547
- Fine.

1:01:59.866 --> 1:02:01.675
So how are things
going with your dad?

1:02:04.204 --> 1:02:05.369
- Okay.

1:02:05.389 --> 1:02:07.514
- Well that doesn't
sound very convincing.

1:02:10.043 --> 1:02:11.560
- Can I ask you a question, mom?

1:02:11.636 --> 1:02:12.728
- Yeah, anything.

1:02:14.380 --> 1:02:16.398
- Do you ever still
get mad at dad?

1:02:16.549 --> 1:02:19.476
- Honey, I haven't spoken
with your dad in years.

1:02:19.628 --> 1:02:23.238
- Well, I don't mean like a
fight, I mean about the past.

1:02:24.316 --> 1:02:26.408
- Well, if I were to let
myself think about it

1:02:26.485 --> 1:02:30.153
I might feel hurt but
being mad about the past

1:02:30.305 --> 1:02:32.372
is such a waste
of precious time.

1:02:35.401 --> 1:02:36.585
Now, if you're feeling guilty

1:02:36.661 --> 1:02:39.087
about spending Christmas
with your dad, don't.

1:02:40.816 --> 1:02:41.923
- It's not that.

1:02:42.075 --> 1:02:45.001
- Oh honey, Phil
is waving for me.

1:02:45.153 --> 1:02:46.094
I gotta go.

1:02:46.246 --> 1:02:47.262
- [Erin] I love you mom.

1:02:47.413 --> 1:02:49.264
- Oh, I love you sweetheart.

1:02:49.415 --> 1:02:50.390
Merry Christmas.

1:02:51.584 --> 1:02:54.102
(subtle music)

1:03:03.505 --> 1:03:05.947
(subtle music)

1:03:22.374 --> 1:03:25.967
- Your daddy calls
this his love tree.

1:03:29.455 --> 1:03:30.639
- I didn't know he did this.

1:03:30.790 --> 1:03:32.215
- Oh yeah.

1:03:32.367 --> 1:03:33.809
He says he carves the names

1:03:33.960 --> 1:03:35.977
of all the people he
loves on this tree

1:03:36.054 --> 1:03:38.204
because even if he
can't be with them

1:03:38.206 --> 1:03:40.056
to watch them grow
up or grow old,

1:03:40.208 --> 1:03:43.151
he can watch this tree
grow big and strong

1:03:43.228 --> 1:03:45.111
and know that
everything will be okay.

1:03:46.973 --> 1:03:47.781
- So sweet.

1:03:50.552 --> 1:03:52.569
- He couldn't love you
or those girls more,

1:03:52.721 --> 1:03:53.995
or be more proud of you.

1:04:00.579 --> 1:04:02.003
Well, I better get
back up to the house.

1:04:02.080 --> 1:04:05.656
I promised the girls
we'd bedazzle some

1:04:05.676 --> 1:04:06.508
- Okay.

1:04:09.680 --> 1:04:11.754
- Smells like it's
going to snow.

1:04:11.907 --> 1:04:13.181
- We never get snow here.

1:04:15.410 --> 1:04:16.852
What does snow smell like?

1:04:17.003 --> 1:04:19.813
- I can't describe it, but
this nose is never wrong.

1:04:23.085 --> 1:04:25.527
(subtle music)

1:04:45.883 --> 1:04:46.798
- I'm up.

1:04:47.959 --> 1:04:50.110
- I didn't mean to wake you.

1:04:50.128 --> 1:04:52.053
- I can't sleep anyway.

1:04:53.965 --> 1:04:55.348
Thinking about Erin.

1:04:56.468 --> 1:04:58.810
- Just give her some time.

1:05:02.124 --> 1:05:07.027
- I just, I feel like everything
I say is the wrong thing.

1:05:08.480 --> 1:05:09.905
She barely even looks at me.

1:05:11.633 --> 1:05:14.075
- Well, unfortunately there's
not an expiration date

1:05:14.152 --> 1:05:15.327
on a broken heart.

1:05:17.155 --> 1:05:20.081
You're just going to have to
be patient until Erin's ready.

1:05:21.993 --> 1:05:25.979
- I just, it just feels like

1:05:25.997 --> 1:05:29.174
I'm hanging myself out
there like a punching bag.

1:05:30.502 --> 1:05:32.093
- Then let her punch it out.

1:05:33.155 --> 1:05:34.821
Erin's babies adore you

1:05:34.839 --> 1:05:36.489
and you have to do
everything you can

1:05:36.508 --> 1:05:38.683
to stay in their
and Erin's life.

1:05:46.259 --> 1:05:47.925
- What would I do without you?

1:05:47.945 --> 1:05:50.528
- Starve and never
match your socks.

1:05:51.764 --> 1:05:54.908
(subtle country music)

1:06:12.043 --> 1:06:13.301
- Oh, can I have another one?

1:06:13.378 --> 1:06:15.619
- You already had five.

1:06:16.640 --> 1:06:19.365
- Two were s'mores and
two were for my stomach.

1:06:19.384 --> 1:06:21.384
- Aren't they all
for your stomach?

1:06:21.536 --> 1:06:23.886
- My stomach likes
to mix things up.

1:06:24.039 --> 1:06:24.887
- Fair enough.

1:06:25.816 --> 1:06:27.874
- Hand one of those
to your fella.

1:06:27.892 --> 1:06:29.275
- Dad, seriously?

1:06:31.971 --> 1:06:33.046
Here you go.

1:06:33.064 --> 1:06:33.989
- Thanks.

1:06:35.550 --> 1:06:38.309
- I'm telling you, sea
salt, dark chocolate,

1:06:38.328 --> 1:06:39.643
perfect s'mores.

1:06:39.663 --> 1:06:41.621
- Well far be it for me
to argue with the chef.

1:06:49.397 --> 1:06:51.006
- You know Erin,

1:06:53.585 --> 1:06:55.677
this is the best Christmas
that I've had in a long time.

1:06:57.848 --> 1:07:02.934
- Me too.

1:07:09.100 --> 1:07:12.193
(subtle guitar music)

1:07:16.366 --> 1:07:20.260
¶ Silent night ¶

1:07:20.278 --> 1:07:24.039
¶ Holy night ¶

1:07:24.115 --> 1:07:27.709
¶ All is calm ¶

1:07:27.860 --> 1:07:31.362
¶ All is bright ¶

1:07:31.381 --> 1:07:36.384
¶ Round young virgin
mother and child ¶

1:07:38.797 --> 1:07:41.306
¶ Holy infant ¶

1:07:47.397 --> 1:07:49.731
- Thanks for inviting
me over tonight,

1:07:49.808 --> 1:07:51.066
I had a lot of fun.

1:07:51.142 --> 1:07:54.194
Kinda, kinda felt like I
was a part of the family.

1:07:55.238 --> 1:07:56.071
- Good.

1:07:57.299 --> 1:08:00.466
- So uh, am I gonna
see you tomorrow

1:08:00.468 --> 1:08:01.868
at the Christmas Eve service?

1:08:04.915 --> 1:08:09.918
- Good.

1:08:11.922 --> 1:08:15.090
- Mom, how many
lizards are leaping?

1:08:15.166 --> 1:08:16.007
- Um, 10.

1:08:17.260 --> 1:08:19.427
- I told you it was 10, Carter.

1:08:25.343 --> 1:08:26.434
- I'd better go referee.

1:08:27.846 --> 1:08:30.330
I have a feeling this could
turn to a controversy.

1:08:30.332 --> 1:08:32.857
- Goodnight, see you tomorrow.

1:08:34.760 --> 1:08:35.610
- Tomorrow.

1:08:37.430 --> 1:08:39.906
(subtle music)

1:08:51.035 --> 1:08:52.293
(knocking)

1:08:52.445 --> 1:08:54.295
Girls, you can't come in,
I'm doing secret stuff.

1:08:54.447 --> 1:08:55.130
- It's me.

1:08:55.281 --> 1:08:56.381
- Okay, come in quick.

1:08:59.952 --> 1:09:01.302
Do you like a challenge?

1:09:04.883 --> 1:09:08.893
- Erin, I've been wanting to
talk to you about something.

1:09:13.316 --> 1:09:16.317
I'm sorry I wasn't around much,

1:09:16.469 --> 1:09:18.378
but I thought I was
doing the right thing

1:09:18.396 --> 1:09:22.548
for you and your mom by
being a good provider.

1:09:23.568 --> 1:09:28.329
I know the damage is done and
well, maybe it's too late.

1:09:40.084 --> 1:09:41.301
- It's just hard for me,

1:09:43.087 --> 1:09:44.904
especially to watch
you with the girls

1:09:44.906 --> 1:09:47.998
because when I was their age,

1:09:48.018 --> 1:09:53.079
you were always working and
then when you and mom split up,

1:09:53.097 --> 1:09:54.522
I saw you even less.

1:09:56.526 --> 1:10:00.278
- Yeah, I missed a lot
when you were little.

1:10:01.698 --> 1:10:03.531
- But it's not just
when I was little, dad.

1:10:03.608 --> 1:10:06.701
You missed my high
school graduation.

1:10:06.852 --> 1:10:08.369
- Well, I had to go
to that conference

1:10:08.521 --> 1:10:11.097
and I told you that,
you said you understood.

1:10:12.267 --> 1:10:15.501
- I just said that because I
didn't know how to talk to you.

1:10:19.031 --> 1:10:21.382
It felt like you
were a stranger.

1:10:25.280 --> 1:10:26.137
- A stranger?

1:10:29.951 --> 1:10:33.811
Erin, all I want is a
chance to start again.

1:10:35.398 --> 1:10:40.401
- I know, but I've
got a cut so deep,

1:10:41.813 --> 1:10:43.696
I don't think it's
ever going to heal.

1:10:45.483 --> 1:10:50.411
- Do you want to heal, Erin?

1:10:50.488 --> 1:10:51.329
- What?

1:10:53.141 --> 1:10:55.166
- Do you want to heal it?

1:11:02.667 --> 1:11:04.175
- I can't do this.

1:11:12.827 --> 1:11:15.603
I thought I could handle
spending Christmas here but,

1:11:17.181 --> 1:11:17.939
I can't.

1:11:19.350 --> 1:11:21.258
- [Gary] Erin,

1:11:21.278 --> 1:11:22.110
Erin,

1:11:23.021 --> 1:11:24.353
Erin doll.

1:11:24.506 --> 1:11:26.430
- This should be
colored, maybe pink.

1:11:27.284 --> 1:11:29.342
- There's a little
change of plans, girls.

1:11:29.360 --> 1:11:30.118
- What?

1:11:31.195 --> 1:11:32.436
- Well, mommy needs to go home

1:11:32.455 --> 1:11:35.123
so we're going to have
to leave Grandee's house.

1:11:35.199 --> 1:11:38.793
- But it's Christmas
Eve, we can't go.

1:11:38.944 --> 1:11:40.686
- And Farrah got
us special outfits

1:11:40.688 --> 1:11:43.706
for the service tonight and
she said the pastor said

1:11:43.858 --> 1:11:46.692
we could carry the baby
Jesus to the manger.

1:11:46.711 --> 1:11:48.469
- [Carter] And I told
Santa we would be here

1:11:48.546 --> 1:11:51.055
and he won't know where
to take our presents.

1:11:52.033 --> 1:11:52.765
- Erin.

1:11:57.055 --> 1:11:58.646
- Okay, we can stay.

1:11:58.723 --> 1:12:01.874
But we need to leave first
thing tomorrow morning, okay?

1:12:01.893 --> 1:12:03.318
- Okay, thank you.

1:12:05.046 --> 1:12:06.228
- Farrah, do you mind
watching the girls?

1:12:06.381 --> 1:12:07.822
I'm just going to
go for a drive.

1:12:07.899 --> 1:12:08.564
- Of course.

1:12:08.716 --> 1:12:09.574
- Thanks.

1:12:13.163 --> 1:12:14.053
- Erin.

1:12:14.072 --> 1:12:15.054
Erin, don't.

1:12:15.073 --> 1:12:16.622
- Gary, just give
her some space.

1:12:23.581 --> 1:12:24.839
- Your mom is just
going to go out

1:12:24.990 --> 1:12:26.323
and do some last minute
Christmas shopping

1:12:26.343 --> 1:12:29.427
while we get these
cinnamon rolls all ready.

1:12:31.997 --> 1:12:35.183
(subtle country music)

1:12:56.021 --> 1:12:56.871
- Go ahead.

1:12:58.783 --> 1:13:00.208
- Everything okay?

1:13:00.359 --> 1:13:04.453
Let's um, let's head
over to the booth.

1:13:04.606 --> 1:13:06.547
- I'm so sorry, I know
you're really busy.

1:13:07.550 --> 1:13:08.716
I just wanted to
let you know that

1:13:08.868 --> 1:13:11.552
we're leaving tomorrow morning

1:13:11.704 --> 1:13:13.279
right after the girls wake up.

1:13:14.298 --> 1:13:16.557
- I thought you were
staying through Christmas.

1:13:18.286 --> 1:13:19.619
You all right?

1:13:19.637 --> 1:13:23.398
- It's my dad, he and I
don't communicate very well.

1:13:25.217 --> 1:13:26.234
I came out here this Christmas

1:13:26.385 --> 1:13:28.194
to see if I could fix that.

1:13:29.647 --> 1:13:30.738
- And it can't be fixed?

1:13:33.484 --> 1:13:35.868
- When I was little, my
dad worked all the time,

1:13:37.563 --> 1:13:41.899
like all the time and I
see him now with my girls

1:13:41.918 --> 1:13:45.753
and instead of appreciating
the granddad he's become,

1:13:45.905 --> 1:13:48.497
it's like, I, like I'm jealous

1:13:48.650 --> 1:13:50.425
that he wasn't that
kind of dad for me.

1:13:52.003 --> 1:13:54.745
- Look, I'm not trying
to defend your dad,

1:13:54.764 --> 1:13:58.174
but I can at least tell
you what it's like.

1:13:58.326 --> 1:14:03.229
I've sacrificed a lot in
my life for this restaurant

1:14:04.832 --> 1:14:07.833
and that's the reason why I
don't have a wife or a family.

1:14:07.835 --> 1:14:13.189
- Oh, yeah I understand.

1:14:13.341 --> 1:14:13.931
Yeah.

1:14:13.950 --> 1:14:15.174
- Here.

1:14:15.193 --> 1:14:16.284
- No, I'm really glad
that you told me now

1:14:16.360 --> 1:14:17.118
rather than later.

1:14:18.179 --> 1:14:20.955
- Wait, wait, hold on a second.

1:14:21.106 --> 1:14:24.417
- Look, I don't want to be a
distraction from your work.

1:14:26.779 --> 1:14:29.464
- That's not what
I meant at all.

1:14:31.968 --> 1:14:34.093
- But it's what you said.

1:14:45.707 --> 1:14:48.816
- Hey Erin, hey wait up.

1:14:48.968 --> 1:14:51.944
- I got to go Dina, but it
was so nice meeting you.

1:14:53.156 --> 1:14:58.159
- Look, sometimes that
strong silent type thing

1:15:00.054 --> 1:15:03.906
that Mateo does comes
across like he doesn't care,

1:15:04.058 --> 1:15:04.999
but he does.

1:15:09.154 --> 1:15:10.630
- He's still inside, isn't he?

1:15:11.991 --> 1:15:12.798
I mean, I'm leaving.

1:15:15.661 --> 1:15:16.677
- Give him a chance.

1:15:24.003 --> 1:15:25.261
- If there's one
thing that I learned

1:15:25.413 --> 1:15:26.845
when I lost my husband,

1:15:28.173 --> 1:15:30.525
it's how it's foolish to
waste a second of your time.

1:15:33.104 --> 1:15:36.322
(subtle country music)

1:15:48.360 --> 1:15:53.439
¶ Star of wonder ¶

1:15:53.624 --> 1:15:58.627
¶ Star of night ¶

1:15:59.130 --> 1:16:03.224
¶ Star of warm,
beauty and bright ¶

1:16:09.957 --> 1:16:11.307
- Where's mom?

1:16:11.459 --> 1:16:12.400
- Is she going to miss us

1:16:12.476 --> 1:16:15.218
putting the baby
Jesus in the nativity?

1:16:15.238 --> 1:16:20.132
- Don't you worry about
your mama, she'll be here.

1:16:20.151 --> 1:16:25.154
¶ Your perfect light ¶

1:16:25.640 --> 1:16:28.583
¶ Your perfect light ¶

1:16:32.404 --> 1:16:33.921
- What are you doing?

1:16:34.073 --> 1:16:36.073
- Packing tamale orders.

1:16:36.092 --> 1:16:37.499
- Go get Erin.

1:16:37.652 --> 1:16:39.076
- She's upset with me.

1:16:39.095 --> 1:16:40.486
- And so what?

1:16:40.488 --> 1:16:41.654
- It's Christmas Eve.

1:16:41.672 --> 1:16:43.672
We have a ton of tamale
orders to get out

1:16:43.825 --> 1:16:46.008
and we're running low on
chicken (speaking Spanish)

1:16:46.160 --> 1:16:47.935
- I can make the tamales.

1:16:48.087 --> 1:16:50.679
- No, no, I can't
put that on you.

1:16:50.832 --> 1:16:52.231
- You aren't putting it on me.

1:16:53.351 --> 1:16:55.517
This is how it works.

1:16:55.670 --> 1:16:59.280
We help each other so that we
don't make stupid mistakes.

1:16:59.357 --> 1:17:03.433
And just a hint, if you don't
leave here to go get her

1:17:03.453 --> 1:17:06.954
that might be the stupidest
mistake of your life.

1:17:07.031 --> 1:17:09.457
So, go get her.

1:17:12.778 --> 1:17:14.795
- You're right, you're right.

1:17:17.191 --> 1:17:18.023
You're the best.

1:17:18.025 --> 1:17:19.950
- You think I don't know that?

1:17:19.969 --> 1:17:22.303
Now get out of here
before I change my mind.

1:17:22.454 --> 1:17:27.141
¶ Star of wonder ¶

1:17:27.292 --> 1:17:32.271
¶ Star of night ¶

1:17:33.632 --> 1:17:38.611
¶ Star of warm,
beauty and bright ¶

1:17:43.384 --> 1:17:45.660
¶ Westward leading ¶

1:17:45.736 --> 1:17:50.222
¶ Stare receding ¶

1:17:50.241 --> 1:17:55.169
¶ Guide us to your
perfect light ¶

1:17:59.825 --> 1:18:02.802
¶ Your perfect light ¶

1:18:05.239 --> 1:18:07.089
(phone ringing)

1:18:07.241 --> 1:18:08.349
- Hello?

1:18:08.500 --> 1:18:10.142
- Mrs. Tessa?

1:18:11.354 --> 1:18:12.853
- Is this Erin?

1:18:13.005 --> 1:18:14.146
Merry Christmas.

1:18:15.358 --> 1:18:17.650
- I'm so sorry to bother
you on Christmas Eve.

1:18:18.844 --> 1:18:20.269
- Oh, you're no bother at all.

1:18:20.421 --> 1:18:22.254
I'm just waiting for my son
to come pick me up for church.

1:18:22.273 --> 1:18:24.514
- [Erin] Oh, that
sounds like fun.

1:18:24.534 --> 1:18:26.534
- Alright, go ahead
and spit it out, honey.

1:18:26.685 --> 1:18:28.160
I can hear your gears turning.

1:18:30.039 --> 1:18:31.280
- How do you forgive someone

1:18:31.432 --> 1:18:33.499
when you can't stop
being angry with them?

1:18:36.287 --> 1:18:40.214
- Well, forgiveness,
forgiveness isn't amnesia.

1:18:42.460 --> 1:18:45.219
It's like giving someone
the benefit of the doubt.

1:18:45.370 --> 1:18:46.887
They can be better next time.

1:18:51.543 --> 1:18:55.062
- I think I'm the one that
needs to be better next time.

1:18:55.139 --> 1:18:57.639
- [Tessa] Oh sweetheart,
if you've gotten that far,

1:18:57.792 --> 1:18:59.734
you've already won
half the battle.

1:19:03.798 --> 1:19:04.405
(horn honking)

1:19:04.556 --> 1:19:06.741
Oh my Jason's here, honey.

1:19:06.817 --> 1:19:07.908
I hate to cut you off, but.

1:19:08.060 --> 1:19:10.578
- No, no, go and have
a wonderful night

1:19:11.989 --> 1:19:13.247
and thank you, Mrs. Tessa.

1:19:14.325 --> 1:19:15.491
- You're welcome sweetheart.

1:19:15.643 --> 1:19:17.084
Merry Christmas.

1:19:17.161 --> 1:19:18.043
- Merry Christmas.

1:19:21.499 --> 1:19:24.717
(subtle country music)

1:19:35.179 --> 1:19:40.107
¶ Oh come let us adore
him Christ the Lord ¶

1:19:43.262 --> 1:19:44.236
- You may be seated.

1:19:47.283 --> 1:19:49.950
Please bow your heads
and join me in prayer.

1:19:52.455 --> 1:19:54.079
- She's still not here.

1:19:57.276 --> 1:20:00.628
- [Pastor] Lord, we thank you
for the blessing of Christmas

1:20:06.710 --> 1:20:10.453
that you sent your son to
Earth, a tiny vulnerable baby,

1:20:10.473 --> 1:20:13.766
and yet the King of Kings.

1:20:17.146 --> 1:20:20.105
- Erin, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

1:20:20.966 --> 1:20:21.890
- I'm fine.

1:20:22.043 --> 1:20:23.466
I should really
get to the girls.

1:20:23.486 --> 1:20:25.561
- I just need a minute.

1:20:25.713 --> 1:20:29.064
What I said about not
having a wife and a family,

1:20:29.216 --> 1:20:31.233
that's a choice that
I made in the past,

1:20:31.385 --> 1:20:35.496
but now I want all that
and I want it with you.

1:20:40.895 --> 1:20:44.797
- I just, I need you to be sure.

1:20:48.010 --> 1:20:50.135
- I'm absolutely certain.

1:20:51.663 --> 1:20:54.181
(subtle music)

1:21:04.752 --> 1:21:07.086
- [Pastor] Through
that tiny baby,

1:21:07.104 --> 1:21:10.155
we all may be
forgiven of our sins.

1:21:13.761 --> 1:21:17.204
Thank you Lord for the
gift of forgiveness,

1:21:18.933 --> 1:21:23.002
help us to remember that gift,
this and every other night.

1:21:24.438 --> 1:21:25.170
Amen.

1:21:28.609 --> 1:21:30.275
Now, if the children
would come forward

1:21:30.277 --> 1:21:32.052
to line up and get the candles

1:21:32.204 --> 1:21:34.463
and adults, please
line up behind them

1:21:34.615 --> 1:21:35.890
for the Christmas vigil.

1:21:37.301 --> 1:21:38.058
Thank you.

1:21:39.470 --> 1:21:42.187
- We get to carry
the baby Jesus.

1:21:45.384 --> 1:21:48.460
¶ Away in the manger ¶

1:21:48.479 --> 1:21:52.406
¶ No crib for a bed ¶

1:21:52.557 --> 1:21:56.135
¶ The little Lord Jesus ¶

1:21:56.137 --> 1:22:00.139
¶ Lay down his sweet head ¶

1:22:00.157 --> 1:22:03.375
¶ The stars in the sky ¶

1:22:06.071 --> 1:22:07.588
- Dad, can I talk to you?

1:22:07.665 --> 1:22:08.923
- Yeah.

1:22:08.999 --> 1:22:13.761
¶ The little Lord Jesus
asleep on the hay ¶

1:22:15.172 --> 1:22:16.764
- I want you in
the girls' lives.

1:22:19.176 --> 1:22:20.893
I want you in my life.

1:22:32.597 --> 1:22:35.115
- I guess it means
you're gonna stay?

1:22:35.267 --> 1:22:35.950
- We're staying.

1:22:38.937 --> 1:22:40.287
I love you daddy, I'm sorry.

1:22:42.941 --> 1:22:45.417
- I love you too and I'm sorry.

1:22:55.454 --> 1:22:59.264
¶ The little Lord Jesus asleep ¶

1:23:07.132 --> 1:23:09.149
- [Pastor] And that concludes
our Christmas Eve service.

1:23:09.226 --> 1:23:11.485
May God bless you everyone.

1:23:19.737 --> 1:23:20.736
- Oh, it's so cold.

1:23:20.888 --> 1:23:21.495
- I know

1:23:22.906 --> 1:23:26.291
(upbeat Christmas music)

1:23:29.897 --> 1:23:31.296
- It's snowing!

1:23:35.494 --> 1:23:38.846
(upbeat Christmas music)

1:23:51.585 --> 1:23:52.359
- Yay!

1:23:56.607 --> 1:23:59.608
- Oh, I think that
might be for you.

1:23:59.760 --> 1:24:02.870
(upbeat country music)

1:24:13.215 --> 1:24:14.048
- Happy Holidays.

1:24:14.124 --> 1:24:14.882
- Merry Christmas.

1:24:16.627 --> 1:24:18.794
- Got you some
Christmas tamales.

1:24:18.946 --> 1:24:20.462
- Please tell me they're
chicken (speaking Spanish)

1:24:20.614 --> 1:24:22.556
- Yeah, they're chicken
(speaking Spanish)

1:24:22.707 --> 1:24:24.558
- Farrah's ham's not going to
be ready for a couple hours,

1:24:24.635 --> 1:24:26.393
I'm gonna start losing
my winter patty.

1:24:28.972 --> 1:24:31.214
- Well, I have
something for you.

1:24:31.233 --> 1:24:32.808
- Oh, you didn't have
to get me anything.

1:24:32.960 --> 1:24:34.068
- It's something I made.

1:24:42.986 --> 1:24:45.913
It's the start of
a new tradition.

1:24:46.064 --> 1:24:49.249
(subtle country music)

1:24:57.259 --> 1:24:58.092
Let's go.

1:24:59.153 --> 1:25:02.262
(upbeat country music)

1:25:17.762 --> 1:25:19.596
¶ It's getting cold again ¶

1:25:19.615 --> 1:25:24.693
¶ I'm hoping that this year
we'll get a little snow ¶

1:25:24.845 --> 1:25:27.621
¶ Hm, hm ¶

1:25:27.698 --> 1:25:30.457
¶ Taking out the decorations ¶

1:25:30.609 --> 1:25:34.870
¶ Hung up all the
lights and mistletoe ¶

1:25:35.022 --> 1:25:37.798
¶ Hm, hm ¶

1:25:37.875 --> 1:25:39.967
¶ The counter's
full of cookies ¶

1:25:40.118 --> 1:25:45.139
¶ And the living room
has got a big ole tree ¶

1:25:45.215 --> 1:25:48.367
¶ Hm, hm ¶

1:25:48.369 --> 1:25:51.036
¶ I'm trying to keep
up our traditions ¶

1:25:51.054 --> 1:25:55.557
¶ I'm trying to live
up to our memories ¶

1:25:55.709 --> 1:25:58.377
¶ Hm, hm ¶

1:25:58.395 --> 1:26:03.398
¶ But I know come starry night ¶

1:26:03.550 --> 1:26:08.495
¶ Sitting by that fire light ¶

1:26:08.889 --> 1:26:13.667
¶ That there's no Christmas ¶

1:26:15.412 --> 1:26:17.963
¶ Without you ¶

1:26:19.066 --> 1:26:22.176
(subtle country music)
