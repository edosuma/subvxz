03:01.185 --> 03:03.037
Fay.

03:37.472 --> 03:39.407
Excuse me, sir?

03:40.641 --> 03:41.951
Excuse me?

03:43.644 --> 03:46.022
Could you tell me
how to get back on route 80?

03:47.148 --> 03:50.168
Sure, honey, just go down the road
about a mile, turn right at the light.

03:50.318 --> 03:51.586
Hey!

03:51.736 --> 03:54.614
Toss the bag on the seat and
I won't blow your fucking head off.

03:54.739 --> 03:57.946
- Are you kidding me?
- You can die laughing if you think so.

03:58.076 --> 04:00.870
Ain't gonna ask you again.

04:02.288 --> 04:04.223
Dumb ass!

04:29.649 --> 04:32.251
Hey! Hey, watch it!

04:32.401 --> 04:34.712
Pay attention, will ya?

04:35.780 --> 04:37.256
Okay.

04:45.123 --> 04:47.917
I was expecting maybe 10 or 15 grand.

04:48.042 --> 04:51.020
So what? We hit the jackpot!

04:55.800 --> 04:56.984
What's wrong?

04:57.135 --> 05:00.238
We gotta get out of Nevada, honey.
That's what's wrong.

05:00.388 --> 05:03.032
You promised me we could go to Vegas.

05:03.307 --> 05:06.410
I don't think you understand the kind
of people that we're dealing with, honey.

05:06.561 --> 05:09.122
You better listen to what I'm saying.

05:11.816 --> 05:15.445
I think we should head north for a while,
maybe just hide out.

05:15.570 --> 05:19.073
Okay. We'll split the money fifty-fifty.

05:19.198 --> 05:22.093
You do what you want. I'm going to Vegas.

05:23.160 --> 05:24.954
Honey, don't fuck with me.

05:25.079 --> 05:28.224
Okay? Don't fuck with me.
I'm not in the mood for it.

05:28.583 --> 05:31.627
You let me off with my half
at the next bus stop.

05:31.752 --> 05:34.188
'Cause I'm going to Vegas.

05:36.007 --> 05:38.985
- What did you say?
- You heard.

06:14.712 --> 06:18.190
- Open the door, Fay.
- No!

06:18.549 --> 06:21.027
Open the door and let me in!
Open the door!

06:21.469 --> 06:23.779
Fuck you, Vince.

06:28.184 --> 06:32.038
Take your hand off the lock.
Open the door!

06:46.160 --> 06:48.554
You ain't going anywhere without me.

06:49.330 --> 06:53.643
If I thought that money was gonna come
between us, I'd just as soon burn it up.

07:13.604 --> 07:16.290
We gotta stay together, baby.

07:17.858 --> 07:19.585
Right?

07:49.056 --> 07:52.034
Come on, honey, I gotta take a piss.

07:53.894 --> 07:55.955
You can go by yourself.

07:56.105 --> 07:58.624
I've seen you do it before.

07:59.733 --> 08:02.920
Yeah, well, I like your company.

08:15.166 --> 08:18.352
Idaho. You're gonna love it there, baby.

08:19.295 --> 08:23.190
I know a little place...
called Hell's Canyon.

08:23.340 --> 08:25.551
It's real peaceful up there.

08:25.676 --> 08:28.571
Lots of hunting, and fishing...

08:28.721 --> 08:33.058
We could hide out for six months,
maybe a year.

08:33.183 --> 08:35.910
Who knows? Maybe we'll never come back.

08:38.230 --> 08:39.999
Yeah.

08:44.486 --> 08:47.423
I bet you're starting to get hungry.

09:14.016 --> 09:18.704
Guess we won't be going
to Hell's Canyon after all, Vince?

10:18.706 --> 10:23.477
Jesus, Jack.
Got anything here that's worth a shit?

10:32.136 --> 10:34.446
Hey, there's nothing in there.

10:39.810 --> 10:42.704
Hey, who's this?

10:43.939 --> 10:46.625
- Wife, girlfriend, or something?
- It's personal.

10:47.526 --> 10:50.212
Nice looking piece of ass.

11:00.122 --> 11:02.683
- Jack.
- I said it was personal.

11:02.833 --> 11:05.310
Did you forget the rules?

11:10.466 --> 11:13.110
You took out a loan, Jack.

11:14.011 --> 11:16.572
You gotta pay it back.

11:21.768 --> 11:24.538
Ten grand. Next Wednesday.

11:30.944 --> 11:33.338
Don't fuck it up.

12:15.739 --> 12:19.801
Can you believe this? At her age.

12:19.952 --> 12:23.622
You know, I'd never try to change
what I was dealt to begin with. Would you?

12:23.747 --> 12:25.974
I hope I don't live long enough
to worry about it.

12:26.333 --> 12:29.353
You got a good point there.
Now, check out time is 11, hon.

12:29.503 --> 12:31.313
Okay.

12:33.006 --> 12:36.134
- Could I borrow that?
- Oh, go ahead.

12:36.259 --> 12:38.470
I don't read 'em anyway.

12:38.595 --> 12:40.822
Thanks.

12:42.099 --> 12:45.077
Daddy! Daddy, there's a man
in the bathroom!

12:50.148 --> 12:52.834
- See!
- Are you alright?

12:58.949 --> 13:02.344
That fucking bitch.

13:08.792 --> 13:10.102
I need a ride.

13:10.252 --> 13:13.397
I'd give you a ride, mister,
but I don't have any room.

13:13.547 --> 13:16.858
- Sure we do, Dad, we got plenty of room.
- Go wait in the car, son.

13:29.896 --> 13:32.290
No room?

13:40.741 --> 13:46.138
Eight hundred,
seventy-five thousand dollars.

14:33.293 --> 14:36.563
Well, how about Holback Chapel,
any of those guys ever pay up?

14:36.713 --> 14:41.484
Those deadbeats are even broker
than you are, if that's possible.

14:47.057 --> 14:49.826
Leave it, Teri, leave it.
What difference does it make?

14:59.778 --> 15:01.880
Hey, look.

15:02.822 --> 15:05.550
What about that place in Maine?

15:05.700 --> 15:08.203
Where you and Kathy used to go.

15:08.328 --> 15:10.513
What's it called...

15:10.664 --> 15:13.892
something "Harbor?"

15:15.543 --> 15:17.646
"Safe Harbor."

15:19.172 --> 15:21.650
Yeah, Safe Harbor.

15:23.093 --> 15:27.238
Reno's eaten away at you,
for Christ's sake.

15:28.473 --> 15:31.660
There's nothing here for you anymore.

15:47.117 --> 15:49.594
Happy anniversary.

17:33.640 --> 17:35.683
Can I help you?

17:35.808 --> 17:37.852
I'm...

17:37.977 --> 17:40.538
looking for Mr. Andrews.

17:41.147 --> 17:43.166
That's me.

17:43.816 --> 17:47.086
- And you're Mrs....
- Miss. Fay Forrester.

17:47.737 --> 17:49.672
Come in.

17:50.114 --> 17:53.952
The work you do is totally confidential,
isn't that right?

17:54.077 --> 17:56.387
That's right. It's guaranteed.

17:56.537 --> 17:58.306
Well...

17:59.249 --> 18:01.559
There's a man.

18:02.001 --> 18:04.103
We were...

18:05.505 --> 18:07.815
involved in a relationship.

18:09.008 --> 18:12.820
He's not right in the head.
He's trying to kill me.

18:13.054 --> 18:15.323
I see.

18:17.433 --> 18:20.036
I don't love him anymore.

18:20.186 --> 18:22.747
I tried to make that clear to him,
but he won't accept it.

18:22.897 --> 18:25.041
And he won't leave me alone.

18:25.191 --> 18:28.570
See, there's no one
to protect me from him.

18:28.695 --> 18:30.905
My folks are both passed away.

18:31.030 --> 18:33.408
I don't have any other family.

18:33.533 --> 18:36.094
There's no one I can turn to.

18:36.452 --> 18:38.554
And you've tried talking to the police?

18:38.705 --> 18:43.434
I can't prove anything. They can't arrest
the guy unless he murders me.

18:43.710 --> 18:47.480
- And what do you want me to do?
- I want you to kill me.

18:48.923 --> 18:50.775
I mean...

18:51.134 --> 18:53.695
I wanna make it look
like I've been killed.

18:54.137 --> 18:56.347
That's a bit extreme, isn't it?

18:56.472 --> 18:58.324
Look...

18:59.058 --> 19:01.327
I made a...

19:01.644 --> 19:04.497
I made a real mess out of things.

19:07.400 --> 19:10.294
I... I want Fay Forrester to die,

19:10.445 --> 19:14.532
so I can take on a new identity.
Is that too much to ask?

19:14.657 --> 19:19.287
It's not that easy. What you want me
to do is illegal. It's a kind of fraud.

19:19.412 --> 19:22.598
This man is gonna kill me.
You think I care about fraud?

19:22.749 --> 19:25.476
I'm just saying that it's not
without a lot of risk.

19:26.335 --> 19:29.147
I'll pay you ten thousand dollars.

19:29.297 --> 19:31.899
Half now, the other half after I'm dead.

19:34.510 --> 19:37.722
That's a lot of money
to be carrying around.

19:37.847 --> 19:40.324
Please, Mr. Andrews.

19:41.809 --> 19:44.245
I can't sleep at night.

19:44.854 --> 19:47.373
I'm scared all the time.

19:48.024 --> 19:50.543
The next time he finds me...

19:53.112 --> 19:55.715
You have to help me!

20:03.831 --> 20:06.768
Ms. Forester,
are you telling me the truth?

20:17.929 --> 20:20.907
This is from the last time I saw him.

20:48.960 --> 20:52.813
Ten thousand's plenty. I'll take half now,
and the other half when the job's done.

20:52.964 --> 20:55.149
Plus expenses.

20:59.095 --> 21:01.364
- So you'll do it?
- Yeah.

21:03.140 --> 21:05.059
Thank you.

21:05.184 --> 21:09.372
There's no guarantee it'll work, and you're
gonna have to be honest with me.

21:11.691 --> 21:13.793
Of course.

21:16.112 --> 21:17.905
I don't know, Jack.

21:18.030 --> 21:21.075
Something about it don't seem right.
You think this girl is telling you the truth?

21:21.200 --> 21:23.010
No.

21:24.161 --> 21:26.597
You should see her.

21:26.747 --> 21:29.308
Anyway, her money's green either way.

21:29.959 --> 21:32.270
Just cause you'd stick your neck
out for a skirt in trouble,

21:32.420 --> 21:36.007
- that don't mean that I have to.
- You interested or not?

21:36.132 --> 21:40.511
Take it easy, I'm just saying...
that you got this nice guy complex.

21:40.636 --> 21:45.032
This whole thing with Kathy.
Sometimes you act like an asshole.

21:46.892 --> 21:50.162
I got a piano salesman for a psychiatrist.

21:51.856 --> 21:56.210
- Only difference is I give advice for free.
- Alan, it's just a job.

21:57.111 --> 21:59.071
You in or not?

21:59.196 --> 22:03.217
Yeah. What the hell,
what's the worst that could happen?

22:03.367 --> 22:06.220
- When do I start?
- Right now.

22:06.370 --> 22:10.683
I need a pint of type A negative blood.

22:12.376 --> 22:14.228
Seriously?

22:24.680 --> 22:27.658
And will that be a single or a double?

22:29.393 --> 22:32.997
I'd like a double bed, but I'm single.

22:35.733 --> 22:37.626
Okay.

22:38.360 --> 22:39.670
Room 15.

22:39.820 --> 22:43.090
What you wanna do, is go out this door...

22:43.365 --> 22:45.159
and...

22:45.284 --> 22:47.595
you go... you go right... you go...

22:47.745 --> 22:51.182
- Straight... why don't I just show you?
- Okay.

22:53.125 --> 22:56.520
- I'll get this for you.
- I'll take that.

22:57.004 --> 22:59.648
- You sure, Ms. Forester?
- Really.

22:59.965 --> 23:01.859
Alright.

23:03.219 --> 23:05.696
Why don't you call me Fay?

23:06.889 --> 23:10.826
- Alright, Fay. Call me Tim.
- Okay, Tim.

23:10.976 --> 23:14.105
So you're sure the clerk
in the motel will remember you?

23:14.230 --> 23:17.291
- He'll remember me.
- Alright.

23:18.317 --> 23:20.361
Then...

23:20.486 --> 23:23.172
should be able to go tonight.

23:25.658 --> 23:28.135
Oh, yeah, here's...

23:29.662 --> 23:31.972
Your new ID.

23:34.166 --> 23:37.186
- West Virginia?
- It was all I could get.

23:41.841 --> 23:43.984
Great!

23:44.134 --> 23:46.487
They look so real.

23:50.182 --> 23:53.077
What do you think you'll do after tonight?

23:54.770 --> 23:58.749
I don't know. I haven't really
thought about it that much.

24:01.360 --> 24:05.923
- You like to gamble?
- Depends on what's at stake.

24:17.751 --> 24:19.603
Seven.

24:24.800 --> 24:27.653
- Seven.
- Alright!

24:57.333 --> 24:59.351
Hi!

24:59.752 --> 25:01.687
Hi.

25:30.115 --> 25:32.051
How'd you do at craps?

25:32.201 --> 25:36.055
Great. I won five hundred dollars.

25:36.872 --> 25:41.585
- You had those guys at the table going.
- Yeah, it was fun.

25:41.710 --> 25:44.188
Wish you could've joined me.

26:08.946 --> 26:10.531
What's that?

26:10.656 --> 26:12.366
Blood.

26:12.491 --> 26:14.885
Same type as yours.

26:15.661 --> 26:19.848
- How'd you get blood?
- It's not that hard.

26:40.352 --> 26:43.163
This is the part I've been waiting for.

26:46.525 --> 26:49.069
The murderer probably...

26:49.194 --> 26:53.490
came here, and... had a few drinks
with you. Go ahead.

26:53.615 --> 26:56.593
The cops love lipstick and...

26:56.743 --> 26:59.012
fingerprints.

27:02.791 --> 27:04.685
So...

27:04.918 --> 27:09.106
You were probably there on the bed, and...

27:10.007 --> 27:13.177
he was here...

27:13.302 --> 27:14.678
Yeah?

27:14.803 --> 27:18.949
And he probably made a pass at me.
Come here.

27:23.979 --> 27:25.872
Probably...

27:27.065 --> 27:29.293
drunk, and...

27:30.152 --> 27:32.296
tried to rough you up.

27:36.658 --> 27:39.094
Yeah, but I tried to fight him off.

27:39.244 --> 27:42.973
Show me how. We gotta make it look real.

27:46.793 --> 27:49.563
You can do better than that, Jack.

27:50.005 --> 27:54.610
You gotta do a good job.
This is costing me a lot of money.

27:58.180 --> 28:00.616
Come on. Come on, rip it!

28:00.766 --> 28:03.410
I would've put up a fight.

28:09.816 --> 28:11.877
And then...

28:12.694 --> 28:16.089
the murderer gets tired of wrestling.

28:16.406 --> 28:18.967
And decides...

28:19.117 --> 28:21.328
to kill the bitch.

28:21.453 --> 28:23.889
And take her money.

28:31.213 --> 28:33.106
Exhibit A.

28:40.889 --> 28:43.433
Wanna put some on me?

28:43.558 --> 28:47.996
I gotta put some...
holes in your dress, first.

29:01.076 --> 29:04.471
Wouldn't it be easier
if I took my dress off?

29:11.294 --> 29:13.146
Sorry.

29:38.864 --> 29:43.552
I always wondered what it'd be like
to die a really violent death.

29:44.202 --> 29:46.663
Well, now you know.

29:46.788 --> 29:48.557
Yeah.

29:58.300 --> 30:01.111
Just lie there like you're dead.

30:12.063 --> 30:14.291
You left everything in here?

30:14.441 --> 30:17.127
Except my car keys, which you have.

30:38.673 --> 30:41.067
Don't laugh, you're dead.

31:00.612 --> 31:04.257
- What are you doing?
- Putting you in the trunk.

31:04.783 --> 31:06.676
Quiet!

31:43.988 --> 31:46.216
We did it?

31:49.577 --> 31:52.205
I can't wait to start being Vera Billings.

31:52.330 --> 31:55.934
- You're still gonna have to be careful.
- Yeah, I know.

31:57.919 --> 31:59.896
You know...

32:00.046 --> 32:02.565
I gotta tell you something.

32:04.092 --> 32:06.736
When I first met you...

32:08.763 --> 32:11.408
I thought you were a loser.

32:16.271 --> 32:18.540
Why'd you hire me?

32:18.690 --> 32:21.084
Why'd you take the job?

32:28.283 --> 32:30.093
Anyway...

32:30.618 --> 32:32.804
I was wrong.

32:33.454 --> 32:36.307
You make a great murderer.

33:00.899 --> 33:03.793
Why don't you come over
to my room when you get back?

33:05.987 --> 33:08.798
I'll pay you the rest of your cash.

33:10.575 --> 33:11.801
We'll celebrate.

33:11.951 --> 33:15.805
It'll take me a couple of hours
to go to the lake and back.

33:17.916 --> 33:20.310
I don't mind.

36:38.199 --> 36:40.051
Jesus!

36:40.952 --> 36:43.930
I'm sorry.
I was just trying to be careful.

36:46.958 --> 36:49.435
What're you sneaking up on me
like that for?

36:49.585 --> 36:53.940
I'm sorry, I was just try... take it easy.

36:54.507 --> 36:56.926
She didn't go all the way down?

36:57.051 --> 37:01.697
No. Doesn't matter.
The cops will just find it sooner.

37:03.224 --> 37:07.328
Yeah. This is a spooky place at night.

37:09.814 --> 37:12.249
You know, this used to be
sacred Indian land?

37:12.400 --> 37:16.671
They say that there's ghosts,
ghosts and spirits, you know?

37:18.030 --> 37:20.508
So when do we get paid?

37:21.283 --> 37:24.470
- Tomorrow.
- Want some?

37:25.830 --> 37:28.391
Hallelujah, boy.

37:53.607 --> 37:55.501
Fay?

38:09.915 --> 38:13.644
Hi. I'm looking for a woman named
Billings. Have you seen her?

38:13.794 --> 38:16.422
I remember her, good looking.
Friend of yours?

38:16.547 --> 38:18.441
Yeah.

38:19.216 --> 38:21.694
- It's important.
- Well, let's see.

38:22.011 --> 38:25.990
She only checked in early this morning,
and she checked out about two hours ago.

38:26.140 --> 38:30.411
I know because I had to get her
a cab to take her to the airport.

38:31.270 --> 38:33.080
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, of course I'm sure.

38:33.230 --> 38:36.876
I wouldn't forget a thing like that.
I'm not that old.

38:46.785 --> 38:48.471
Unbelievable.

38:48.829 --> 38:51.682
Oh, yeah, I remember her. Definitely.

38:52.583 --> 38:54.877
- Hard to forget if you know what I mean.
- Yeah.

38:55.002 --> 38:58.731
Yeah, she took flight 405 to Las Vegas.

38:59.089 --> 39:02.943
- Got away from you.
- Yeah, she sure did.

39:04.428 --> 39:06.322
When's the next flight?

39:06.472 --> 39:09.241
Next available is...

39:09.600 --> 39:11.911
tomorrow morning, 11 am.

39:12.519 --> 39:14.830
Thanks for all your help.

39:15.439 --> 39:17.333
Good luck.

39:23.572 --> 39:25.591
Hey, Andrews.

39:25.741 --> 39:28.744
Jack Andrews,
we got a warrant for your arrest.

39:28.869 --> 39:30.971
The hell you do.

39:32.206 --> 39:34.183
Come on.

39:37.586 --> 39:40.981
- You got a warrant for that?
- Yeah. Get him out of here.

39:47.721 --> 39:51.742
- When did you first meet Fay Forrester?
- Never heard of her.

39:52.059 --> 39:54.436
Where were you at 11:40 last night, Jack.

39:54.561 --> 39:57.356
Drinking. With friends. Alan Swayze.

39:57.481 --> 40:00.526
- What's his phone number?
- You got a phone book, look it up.

40:00.651 --> 40:03.837
- Ever been in the Rancho Sierra?
- What's that, a whorehouse?

40:05.906 --> 40:08.784
- Got any debts, Jack?
- A few, why?

40:08.909 --> 40:13.138
- How'd you get that broken finger?
- Closing the file cabinet.

40:13.998 --> 40:16.016
Who gave you the scratch
on the face, Jack?

40:16.250 --> 40:17.977
What scratch?

40:20.170 --> 40:23.215
You used to be a pretty normal,
law-abiding citizen, Jack.

40:23.340 --> 40:26.860
Degree in business,
insurance investigator for three years.

40:27.302 --> 40:30.723
- Married... briefly.
- And you got a point?

40:30.848 --> 40:35.119
Well, then things kinda go downhill.
1987, drunk and disorderly.

40:35.477 --> 40:38.230
'88, a week in jail
for withholding evidence.

40:38.355 --> 40:39.790
I was protecting a client.

40:40.024 --> 40:44.987
Two current moving violations,
and $270 in outstanding parking tickets.

40:45.112 --> 40:47.131
Parking tickets. You got me.

40:56.290 --> 40:59.059
Jack, there's somebody I want you to meet.

41:02.463 --> 41:05.232
Is this the man you saw last night?

41:06.216 --> 41:08.193
Take your time.

41:10.929 --> 41:13.849
- No, he doesn't look anything like him.
- You sure?

41:13.974 --> 41:17.202
This guy was big, mean-looking!

41:17.352 --> 41:20.873
I can't believe Fay was with this guy.
I can't believe she's...

41:21.023 --> 41:23.542
It's okay, Tim, thanks.

41:42.503 --> 41:44.897
You're a murder suspect
in this case, Jack.

41:45.047 --> 41:48.342
And as such, you're forbidden by law
from leaving Washoe County

41:48.467 --> 41:50.928
without permission in writing from me.

41:51.053 --> 41:54.448
- You understand that, Jack.
- You're wasting your time.

41:56.350 --> 41:58.035
You know...

41:58.185 --> 42:00.646
there was another woman
that disappeared...

42:00.771 --> 42:03.874
in a car, in a lake,
a couple of years ago.

42:04.107 --> 42:06.944
You were there, Jack.
Maybe there's a connection.

42:07.069 --> 42:11.507
Hey, Sam, come on. Everybody knows
that was an accident. Give the guy a break.

42:11.657 --> 42:15.093
Oh, yeah, sure,
that was an accident, wasn't it?

42:15.244 --> 42:17.429
He managed to save his own skin...

42:17.788 --> 42:20.098
Son of a bitch! Get him out of here!

42:20.249 --> 42:23.477
Get him out of here
before I break his fucking neck!

42:23.627 --> 42:25.312
Get him out of here!

43:03.792 --> 43:07.187
A suspect, Reno private
investigator Jack Andrews,

43:07.546 --> 43:09.756
was arrested in connection
with the alleged murder,

43:09.881 --> 43:12.634
but was released this morning
after questioning.

43:12.759 --> 43:16.321
That ain't gonna be too good
for business, is it, Jack?

43:17.055 --> 43:19.157
So, you think she set you up or what?

43:19.307 --> 43:21.476
She wouldn't set me up,
I'd blow her whole scheme.

43:21.601 --> 43:23.645
There had to be some minor connection.

43:23.770 --> 43:26.832
Unless she wanted people to think
that she was trying to be dead.

43:27.107 --> 43:31.169
I don't care what she's trying to pull.
She owes me and I wanna collect.

43:32.154 --> 43:34.756
Oh, man, you hear what you're saying?

43:35.198 --> 43:37.300
Listen to you!

43:37.534 --> 43:41.330
Jack, blow it off. You leave town
and Hendricks is gonna send you to jail.

43:41.455 --> 43:44.182
Then I'll do the 30 days and pay the fine.

43:53.341 --> 43:56.178
I want you to check
all the hotels in Vegas.

43:56.303 --> 44:00.323
She's probably under
the name of Vera Billings.

44:00.474 --> 44:02.617
Vera Billings.

44:02.976 --> 44:05.103
Alright. I'll get on it right away.

44:05.228 --> 44:07.939
And try to get back here
as soon as you can.

44:08.064 --> 44:10.917
I got nobody minding the store
'til Teri comes back.

44:14.738 --> 44:17.866
What do you say, Jack? Going somewhere?

44:17.991 --> 44:20.827
No. Just walking my friend to his car.

44:20.952 --> 44:23.555
- Have a nice trip.
- Yeah. Thanks, Jack.

44:23.997 --> 44:26.266
Excuse me, boys.

44:27.167 --> 44:29.519
Drive careful.

44:30.754 --> 44:33.857
What are you guys doing here?
I still got a couple of days.

44:34.007 --> 44:38.403
Heard you was in jail.
Thought there might be a problem.

44:46.937 --> 44:49.247
There's thirty-four hundred.

44:50.357 --> 44:55.153
Very good, Jack. Very good.
Where'd you get it?

44:55.278 --> 44:58.115
Don't you read the papers?
I killed somebody.

44:58.240 --> 45:00.342
Funny guy!

45:04.496 --> 45:07.891
Come on, you'll get
the rest in three days.

45:13.380 --> 45:16.983
Now, I really hope you're not
thinking about leaving town.

45:17.300 --> 45:21.112
Now why would I want to do that?
I'm very happy here.

45:23.473 --> 45:26.034
Take care of that finger.

45:55.255 --> 45:56.773
Yes.

45:56.923 --> 46:00.694
I've been waiting
for my checking account balance.

46:02.512 --> 46:04.097
Great.

46:04.222 --> 46:07.117
Seven hundred and thirty-two...

46:25.535 --> 46:28.121
Sorry, we're closed.

46:28.246 --> 46:34.102
- Yeah, well, the door was open.
- My fault, sorry, but we're closed.

46:34.502 --> 46:38.898
- Are you Jack?
- Yeah, but... like I said...

46:41.217 --> 46:43.403
Jack Andrews.

46:55.607 --> 46:58.860
- What'd you do with Fay Forrester.
- Never heard of her.

46:58.985 --> 47:01.379
You're a fucking liar.

47:03.323 --> 47:05.884
The cops got it wrong.
I never heard of her.

47:06.493 --> 47:08.954
I've never heard of her!

47:09.079 --> 47:10.805
Well, I'm gonna kill you anyway.

47:21.758 --> 47:24.652
Alright, hold it! I said hold it!

47:31.184 --> 47:33.745
Your gun ain't loaded, Jack.

48:05.343 --> 48:08.279
How you feeling? Feeling alright?

48:56.519 --> 48:59.230
Hi, how are ya? This is Jim Peterson,
calling from Reno.

48:59.355 --> 49:02.333
I got some information here
for Mr. Maranot.

49:06.112 --> 49:08.256
Sit down.

49:26.466 --> 49:28.568
- Jim!
- Hey, Jonesy, how ya doing?

49:28.718 --> 49:29.777
<i>I'm fine, I'm fine.</i>

49:29.927 --> 49:34.265
<i>Look, Mr. Maranot says the money was
wrapped in green rubber bands, all hundreds.</i>

49:34.390 --> 49:38.728
Yeah, well, a couple of my boys picked up
some cash that matches that description

49:38.853 --> 49:42.190
from some small-time gambler
named Jack Andrews.

49:42.315 --> 49:46.461
He's got some half-assed private
eye business. You ever heard of him?

49:46.778 --> 49:47.920
No.

49:48.071 --> 49:50.281
I sent my boys to pick him up,
but he was gone.

49:50.406 --> 49:55.178
Well, keep looking, okay? If you find him,
Mr. Maranot is going to be very appreciative.

49:55.328 --> 49:59.015
- Okay, Jonesy. We'll keep looking.
- <i>Okay, Big Jim. Be good.</i>

49:59.165 --> 50:01.017
Right.

50:01.626 --> 50:03.352
That Andrews is dead meat.

50:18.434 --> 50:22.205
- Yeah, Collect from Jack.
- Hey, Jack, what the hell happened here?

50:22.355 --> 50:24.123
Fay's boyfriend happened.

50:24.273 --> 50:27.568
He's mean, and he may still be hanging
around there. So watch out for yourself.

50:27.693 --> 50:31.739
- Me? What about you? Are you alright?
- Fine. Did you find her?

50:31.864 --> 50:35.910
I checked all the big places and there was
no Vera Billings registered anywhere.

50:36.035 --> 50:39.414
- Damn.
- <i>But there was a...</i>

50:39.539 --> 50:43.309
a Virginia Billingsly
registered at the Hilton.

50:43.501 --> 50:46.963
What do you say, this babe is one of the
most cunning criminal minds of the century.

50:47.088 --> 50:48.564
Yeah, that sounds like her.

50:48.714 --> 50:51.859
Listen, Alan, I'll talk to you later.
I'll call you this afternoon.Thanks.

50:52.009 --> 50:54.612
- <i>Take it easy, man.</i>
- Bye.

50:55.054 --> 50:57.615
Virginia Billingsly.

51:21.831 --> 51:23.850
Excuse me.

51:24.000 --> 51:28.479
I've got a special delivery
for a Virginia Billingsly.

51:28.629 --> 51:31.399
Virginia... Billingsly.

51:31.841 --> 51:36.529
- Oh, would you like me to ring her room?
- Oh, no, no, I have to hand deliver it.

51:37.346 --> 51:40.491
I'm sorry, sir, I'm not allowed to give you
her room number. It's hotel policy.

51:40.641 --> 51:44.729
Oh, I understand. But... See...

51:44.854 --> 51:46.647
She's an old friend, and...

51:46.772 --> 51:50.860
She doesn't know I'm coming into town,
and I wanted to surprise her.

51:50.985 --> 51:53.546
I'm sorry.
The best I could do is call her.

51:53.738 --> 51:55.089
Okay.

51:55.239 --> 51:59.218
- Who should I say is calling?
- Jack Reno.

52:09.795 --> 52:12.840
I'm sorry, sir, she's not answering.
Would you like to leave a message?

52:12.965 --> 52:16.527
- No, I'll... I'll come back later.
- Okay.

52:31.692 --> 52:33.544
Hi. What can I get ya?

53:06.018 --> 53:07.019
Yeah?

53:07.144 --> 53:09.538
<i>This is Spiv. I think I found something
you'd be interested in.</i>

53:09.688 --> 53:10.790
Oh, yeah?

53:37.550 --> 53:40.361
That's quite a dress you got there, Fay.

53:41.137 --> 53:43.864
Jack, honey, hi. How're you doing?

53:44.014 --> 53:47.101
You have to say goodbye
to your friends, Virginia.

53:47.226 --> 53:51.330
- I'm on a roll here.
- Sorry, boys, time to go.

53:51.897 --> 53:54.208
Come on, Virginia.

53:56.735 --> 53:59.255
Sorry, fellas. Gotta run.

54:03.450 --> 54:05.636
So...

54:07.079 --> 54:09.640
Want a drink or something?

54:13.502 --> 54:16.063
Met your boyfriend.

54:27.683 --> 54:31.495
- Does he know about me?
- Not yet.

54:49.622 --> 54:51.765
I'm sorry.

54:53.167 --> 54:57.855
I didn't want to run away from you.
But I was scared.

54:59.757 --> 55:02.776
I didn't want anything to happen to you.

55:06.388 --> 55:09.199
I'll pay you the rest of your cash.

55:33.582 --> 55:36.435
You better just take your money and go.

55:41.840 --> 55:43.968
What's going on?

55:44.093 --> 55:46.028
- What's going on?
- Housekeeping.

55:46.178 --> 55:47.821
Come back later?

55:51.392 --> 55:53.477
Yeah. Yeah, that's him alright.

55:53.602 --> 55:56.663
That's the son of a bitch who shot Marty,
and she's the one who drove away in the car.

55:56.814 --> 55:59.249
Who are you guys, you got the...

55:59.858 --> 56:03.504
- Put the gun down and relax.
- Where's the money?

56:04.446 --> 56:06.673
There it is.

56:07.282 --> 56:10.536
There it is. On the floor.
That's my briefcase!

56:10.661 --> 56:12.471
Don't move.

56:16.875 --> 56:18.685
See.

56:19.294 --> 56:21.063
That's it alright.

56:22.089 --> 56:23.941
You're dead, chump.

56:51.493 --> 56:54.221
I don't wanna go to jail, Jack.

57:03.589 --> 57:05.482
Come on.

57:06.175 --> 57:07.651
Come on!

57:28.030 --> 57:30.324
Where'd you get the money?

57:30.449 --> 57:33.368
I'll tell you later.
Just drive the goddamn car.

57:33.493 --> 57:34.928
You'll tell me later?

57:40.167 --> 57:43.186
Jesus, Jack are you crazy?

57:44.546 --> 57:46.773
What are you doing?

57:47.716 --> 57:49.651
Jack, I'm scared!

57:49.801 --> 57:52.362
What are you afraid of?
It was self-defense.

57:52.512 --> 57:54.932
They'll check out my...

57:55.057 --> 57:57.951
- They'll find out other things.
- What things, Fay?

58:01.313 --> 58:05.167
Vince stole the money,
and I stole it from Vince.

58:06.568 --> 58:10.297
These guys in Winemuka,
they were working for the mob.

58:10.530 --> 58:13.675
Stealing money from casinos somehow.

58:14.743 --> 58:19.264
Vince killed one of them.
I was there. It was awful.

58:19.414 --> 58:22.459
The other guy was the one
who was just in the hotel room.

58:22.584 --> 58:25.646
So we took off.

58:26.088 --> 58:30.025
I tried to get away,
but he'd have killed me for sure!

58:30.175 --> 58:32.235
So, I...

58:32.761 --> 58:35.989
later, he fell asleep, and I hit him.

58:37.099 --> 58:39.743
I hit him on the head.

58:41.186 --> 58:44.539
I wanted to tell you the truth before...

58:44.690 --> 58:47.084
but how could I?

58:51.613 --> 58:54.783
I don't want to go to jail, Jack!

58:54.908 --> 58:57.386
I'll die in there!

58:57.953 --> 59:00.305
Is that what you want?

59:11.633 --> 59:13.510
- Yes, sir?
- Is everything okay here, folks?

59:13.635 --> 59:17.572
Yes, she's just... a little upset.

59:18.432 --> 59:21.076
- Okay.
- Thanks.

01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:36.401
Fay.

01:01:34.526 --> 01:01:37.696
We're here. It's good.

01:01:37.821 --> 01:01:41.341
It's safe. You'll love it.

01:01:49.207 --> 01:01:53.395
Do you have any money?
I mean, can I have some? I'm broke.

01:01:58.133 --> 01:02:00.443
For the rooms.

01:02:06.516 --> 01:02:08.451
Rooms?

01:02:19.154 --> 01:02:21.798
You know the air conditioner doesn't work.

01:02:22.741 --> 01:02:24.384
It's okay.

01:02:25.869 --> 01:02:28.388
The ice machine doesn't work either.

01:02:29.205 --> 01:02:30.890
It's alright.

01:02:39.591 --> 01:02:43.386
Alrighty, Mr. Burl.
Let's see, it'll be you, and...

01:02:43.511 --> 01:02:45.405
My wife.

01:02:46.514 --> 01:02:48.408
Alrighty.

01:02:49.142 --> 01:02:50.952
Now...

01:02:52.937 --> 01:02:55.248
26... 27...

01:02:55.398 --> 01:02:57.625
28... 29...

01:02:57.775 --> 01:02:59.986
30... 40...

01:03:00.111 --> 01:03:02.655
60... 80... 100.

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:04.366
Thank you.

01:03:04.491 --> 01:03:06.426
Okay.

01:03:07.911 --> 01:03:11.973
You know, you look familiar to me.
Have you been up here before?

01:03:12.123 --> 01:03:15.185
No. Wish I had, though. Beautiful spot.

01:03:15.585 --> 01:03:17.812
Well, alrighty.

01:03:17.962 --> 01:03:19.856
Thanks.

01:05:11.075 --> 01:05:13.970
- Fay?
- Yeah?

01:05:15.913 --> 01:05:19.892
- I've been thinking about tomorrow.
- Oh, yeah?

01:05:21.252 --> 01:05:23.855
There's a place up in Maine.

01:05:24.005 --> 01:05:28.151
I used to work in insurance,
I found it. It's called...

01:05:28.301 --> 01:05:30.236
"Safe Harbor."

01:05:32.263 --> 01:05:34.574
I was married.

01:05:35.099 --> 01:05:37.410
She died, and...

01:05:39.604 --> 01:05:43.040
- I never wanted to stay in Reno, but...
- Shit!

01:05:48.362 --> 01:05:50.465
I never wanted to stay in Reno.

01:05:54.118 --> 01:05:56.954
She and I thought we'd go there.

01:05:57.079 --> 01:06:00.308
There's some really
beautiful houses along the coast.

01:06:00.458 --> 01:06:02.852
I think it'd be a good place for us.

01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:08.191
- You want me to go with you to Maine?
- Why not?

01:06:18.601 --> 01:06:20.953
I figure you and I...

01:06:21.395 --> 01:06:23.356
have a chance to start over.

01:06:23.481 --> 01:06:26.459
Most people don't get that second chance.

01:06:30.154 --> 01:06:33.633
- You really feel that way about me?
- No.

01:06:34.075 --> 01:06:37.678
- I think you're a greedy, two-faced bitch.
- What?

01:06:37.995 --> 01:06:41.432
There's no reason
I should trust you, but I want to.

01:06:43.167 --> 01:06:46.938
If you're straight with me,
maybe we could help each other.

01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:01.410
What do you say?

01:07:12.530 --> 01:07:15.466
<i>Two suspects have been identified
in yesterday's brutal slaying</i>

01:07:15.616 --> 01:07:17.910
<i>in a Hilton Hotel room of Stanley Jones,</i>

01:07:18.035 --> 01:07:21.222
<i>son-in-law of prominent Las Vegas
businessman William Maranot.</i>

01:07:21.372 --> 01:07:24.934
<i>Police are searching for a woman
using the name Virginia Billingsly.</i>

01:07:25.084 --> 01:07:29.672
<i>The male suspect has been identified
as Jack Andrews, a resident of Reno.</i>

01:07:29.797 --> 01:07:31.924
<i>A manhunt for these suspects
is currently underway</i>

01:07:32.049 --> 01:07:34.777
<i>and roadblocks have been set up
at checkpoints around the state.</i>

01:07:34.927 --> 01:07:39.573
<i>Anyone having information that could help
the investigation should call the Neva...</i>

01:07:42.059 --> 01:07:45.104
Maranot's only the biggest
crime family in Nevada, Fay.

01:07:45.229 --> 01:07:48.499
- Let's just get out of here.
- Roadblocks!

01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:51.669
We couldn't get 20 miles.

01:08:10.337 --> 01:08:12.898
You know what to do, Jack.

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:15.301
Kill me.

01:08:15.426 --> 01:08:17.694
Kill me again.

01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:24.493
You did it before. You could do it again.

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.497
We could die together.

01:08:36.697 --> 01:08:39.591
- <i>Stage and Studio.</i>
- Hi, Alan, it's me.

01:08:40.033 --> 01:08:43.095
Jack. Everybody's looking for you.

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:48.250
- Yeah, well... I'm gonna fix things.
- <i>Wait, wait, how can I find you?</i>

01:08:48.375 --> 01:08:51.520
Listen, I'm not going to be here
long anyway. It doesn't matter.

01:08:51.670 --> 01:08:54.439
Well, where are you going, man?

01:08:55.716 --> 01:08:57.401
It's not important.

01:08:57.551 --> 01:09:00.763
What about your place? All your stuff's
gonna get trashed. You've been evicted.

01:09:00.888 --> 01:09:04.033
<i>I don't care about any of that stuff.
If you can get any of it, it's yours.</i>

01:09:04.183 --> 01:09:08.328
Are you doing this for her?
Hey, don't do anything stupid, man.

01:09:08.479 --> 01:09:11.122
Don't worry, everything's fine.

01:09:12.691 --> 01:09:14.919
Say... say hi to Teri for me.

01:09:16.237 --> 01:09:19.907
<i>Listen, I'm going to send you
and her some money. So...</i>

01:09:20.032 --> 01:09:22.384
<i>look out for it.</i>

01:09:23.702 --> 01:09:26.930
- Hey, look, I gotta get going.
- Hey, wait...

01:09:27.081 --> 01:09:30.309
- Jack! Jack!
- Take it easy.

01:09:30.459 --> 01:09:32.269
Bye.

01:09:35.756 --> 01:09:38.734
- <i>Yes, this is the operator.</i>
- Operator...

01:09:38.884 --> 01:09:42.279
could you tell me
where that call originated from?

01:09:42.429 --> 01:09:45.783
<i>Yes, it was from Overton, Nevada.</i>

01:09:46.183 --> 01:09:48.077
Overton?

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:50.996
Thanks.

01:09:56.151 --> 01:09:58.003
Overton?

01:09:59.697 --> 01:10:01.298
Lake Mead.

01:10:17.131 --> 01:10:20.192
I figure we gotta swim
about 200 yards to the shore.

01:10:20.342 --> 01:10:22.820
It's perfect because it's one
of the deepest parts of the lake.

01:10:22.970 --> 01:10:25.489
It's gonna make
a pretty good escape route.

01:10:28.726 --> 01:10:30.786
Here we are.

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:39.111
This is it.

01:10:39.236 --> 01:10:43.507
Yeah. That's Indian Rock.
See? I'll show you.

01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:47.052
Right here.
This is where I'll sink the boat.

01:10:47.202 --> 01:10:50.122
They'll search and search for us
for months, but they'll never find us.

01:10:50.247 --> 01:10:53.959
The debris coming up,
that can only mean one thing.

01:10:54.084 --> 01:10:58.147
Of course, like I say, we'll have a healthy
swim to the shore. And then about...

01:10:58.297 --> 01:11:00.816
a five mile hike up to the drop point.

01:11:00.966 --> 01:11:02.985
Five miles?

01:11:03.135 --> 01:11:04.903
You'll make it.

01:11:05.054 --> 01:11:07.448
Drop point's up there. And at that point,

01:11:07.598 --> 01:11:11.368
we'll pick up the money and the supplies
we need to make the last leg of the hike.

01:11:11.518 --> 01:11:13.062
Where do we hide the money?

01:11:13.187 --> 01:11:15.998
We bury it, along with the supplies.
Right here.

01:11:16.356 --> 01:11:20.044
On Indian Land. We hike 14 miles
across the state line into Arizona.

01:11:20.194 --> 01:11:23.297
We'll buy a used car in Dalton for cash.

01:11:25.908 --> 01:11:28.719
It was a lot easier last time.

01:11:29.036 --> 01:11:32.264
Well... this time it's for keeps.

01:11:38.712 --> 01:11:42.691
We faked the whole thing, man!
She's not... she's not really dead.

01:11:42.841 --> 01:11:45.110
She's not dead.

01:11:54.895 --> 01:11:58.373
Yeah, well, I knew she wasn't dead.

01:12:01.735 --> 01:12:04.296
She's with your friend...

01:12:04.446 --> 01:12:08.634
- isn't she? Isn't she?
- I don't know, I swear, man.

01:12:09.409 --> 01:12:11.929
I think so, I don't know.

01:12:16.667 --> 01:12:19.061
Don't lie to me, Al.

01:12:19.211 --> 01:12:21.897
I don't like to be lied to.

01:12:35.811 --> 01:12:38.330
I'm going alone, Fay.

01:12:40.274 --> 01:12:43.126
- What?
- I'll bury the money, and the stuff.

01:12:43.277 --> 01:12:45.504
Be back in a couple of hours.

01:12:45.654 --> 01:12:48.507
- It'll be safer that way.
- I wanna go.

01:12:49.116 --> 01:12:52.219
You wanna go? Why?

01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:55.514
Because...

01:12:55.956 --> 01:13:00.143
- I'm afraid.
- Afraid? Of what?

01:13:01.461 --> 01:13:03.772
I'm afraid you won't come back.

01:13:03.922 --> 01:13:06.275
Don't you trust me?

01:13:15.058 --> 01:13:17.536
You don't have to take the money.

01:13:17.686 --> 01:13:21.707
Trust me. I'll be back
in a couple of hours.

01:13:25.235 --> 01:13:26.336
Okay.

01:13:37.706 --> 01:13:40.726
You better come back, you son of a bitch.

01:13:40.876 --> 01:13:44.438
- Where the fuck are they?
- I don't know, man.

01:13:46.381 --> 01:13:49.151
Fuck, man! Leave me alone!

01:13:51.011 --> 01:13:53.447
I don't know, man!

01:13:55.849 --> 01:13:58.201
I'm not asking you again.

01:14:00.103 --> 01:14:01.747
Where are they?

01:14:04.733 --> 01:14:07.127
Son of a bitch!

01:14:09.613 --> 01:14:13.742
You know, you got a whole pack
of these... swishy cigarettes here.

01:14:13.867 --> 01:14:16.178
That's a whole pack, man.

01:14:16.328 --> 01:14:18.805
You better start talking to me.

01:14:22.376 --> 01:14:24.920
Overton! He called from Overton, man.

01:14:25.045 --> 01:14:27.522
That's all I know, I swear.

01:14:29.633 --> 01:14:32.402
Well, where the fuck is Overton?

01:14:33.804 --> 01:14:35.906
Where's Overton?

01:14:36.598 --> 01:14:39.910
It's up by Lake Mead, on the northern tip.

01:14:43.730 --> 01:14:45.540
Okay, Al.

01:14:45.732 --> 01:14:48.585
Betcha can't wait to get
out of that chair, can you?

01:14:54.324 --> 01:14:56.176
Relax.

01:14:56.326 --> 01:14:59.579
Look, just let me go, man. I promise
I won't say anything. Just let me go.

01:14:59.704 --> 01:15:02.891
- You'll never see me again.
- Sure, Al.

01:15:03.041 --> 01:15:04.851
Yep.

01:16:13.486 --> 01:16:15.088
And one of those.

01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:17.632
Thanks.

01:16:33.632 --> 01:16:36.151
What are all the cop cars for?

01:16:36.301 --> 01:16:38.720
They're looking for some killers.

01:16:38.845 --> 01:16:41.473
Shot some folks up in Vegas, I hear.

01:16:41.598 --> 01:16:46.036
Them Arizona cops, they watch the border
while the Nevada cops go to lunch.

01:16:52.275 --> 01:16:54.528
That's mighty neighborly of them.

01:16:54.653 --> 01:16:56.755
Yeah, it is.

01:16:58.031 --> 01:17:01.009
Well, thanks.

01:19:25.136 --> 01:19:27.071
Fay!

01:19:36.939 --> 01:19:40.209
You might live through the rest of the day
if you tell me where my money is.

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:42.712
Jack, he's crazy.

01:19:42.862 --> 01:19:44.589
He'll kill you.

01:19:44.822 --> 01:19:47.675
Tell him where it is.
He'll let us go if you just tell him.

01:19:48.034 --> 01:19:50.161
She's right.

01:19:50.286 --> 01:19:53.014
I am fucking nuts.

01:19:55.708 --> 01:19:57.977
Pull the trigger.

01:20:37.041 --> 01:20:41.796
Okay, Mr. half-assed Dick Tracy,
tell me where the money is...

01:20:41.921 --> 01:20:45.383
- or I'll shoot the bitch.
- Jack!

01:20:45.508 --> 01:20:48.611
- Go ahead.
- Jack!

01:20:48.761 --> 01:20:51.280
Tell him, please!

01:20:51.848 --> 01:20:53.741
Come on.

01:20:54.142 --> 01:20:56.911
- Kill her.
- Jack!

01:21:26.883 --> 01:21:29.485
What exactly do you want, Jack?

01:21:32.305 --> 01:21:34.198
Fay.

01:21:35.892 --> 01:21:41.330
Half the money. Two days head start
till I tell you where your half is.

01:21:45.651 --> 01:21:48.337
- Is that all?
- It's fair.

01:21:48.821 --> 01:21:52.592
- That's better than nothing, Vince.
- Shut up!

01:21:52.742 --> 01:21:55.052
What'll it be, Vince?

01:22:05.046 --> 01:22:07.607
I need to think this over.

01:22:36.953 --> 01:22:39.038
How're ya feeling, Jack?

01:22:39.163 --> 01:22:41.265
Feeling alright?

01:22:44.210 --> 01:22:46.562
How's your finger?

01:23:09.402 --> 01:23:10.878
Nice wallet.

01:24:09.837 --> 01:24:11.313
Hey!

01:24:22.683 --> 01:24:26.078
That bastard's never gonna hurt me again!

01:24:27.454 --> 01:24:29.807
Sorry, Fay.

01:24:33.669 --> 01:24:35.980
Are you alright?

01:24:36.505 --> 01:24:39.358
Open up in there, I'm coming in.

01:25:00.738 --> 01:25:03.966
We're almost there. Get the map out.

01:25:06.452 --> 01:25:10.139
- I left it.
- Left it?

01:25:10.664 --> 01:25:14.727
We still have to walk out of the state.
I guess we'll have to wing it.

01:25:37.232 --> 01:25:39.293
Come on, Fay.

01:26:23.445 --> 01:26:26.548
Guess we won't be going
to Maine after all, Jack?

01:26:29.576 --> 01:26:31.845
Go ahead, honey. Finish him off.

01:26:49.513 --> 01:26:51.682
I think I got him.

01:26:51.807 --> 01:26:54.201
Let's make sure.

01:27:04.027 --> 01:27:05.779
Hey!

01:27:08.448 --> 01:27:12.386
Let's get the hell out of here.
Hey, hey! Gimme that!

01:27:12.536 --> 01:27:14.955
No more bullshit, you understand me?

01:27:20.586 --> 01:27:22.688
Nice truck.

01:27:24.923 --> 01:27:28.550
Hey, genius left the keys. Take this.

01:27:38.353 --> 01:27:40.455
- Fuck... Jesus!
- Fuck!

01:27:40.606 --> 01:27:41.440
Bastard!

01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:45.252
- <i>Roger 34, what's your 20?</i>
- <i>I-15 southbound.</i>

01:27:45.777 --> 01:27:49.323
- Turn around. Go back.
- We're gonna have to get out of here now.

01:27:49.448 --> 01:27:51.675
What do we do?
How do we get our money back?

01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:56.346
Shit!

01:28:04.338 --> 01:28:07.424
Unit 52. Shots fired.
I'm in pursuit of a white Cadillac.

01:28:07.549 --> 01:28:11.695
<i>Tag numbers are wrong, but the model's
correct. I think it's Jack Andrews.</i>

01:28:15.515 --> 01:28:18.285
You're lucky we heard those shots.

01:28:28.653 --> 01:28:32.716
- You're gonna have to go to the doctor.
- No, no.

01:28:35.494 --> 01:28:39.139
How 'bout at the reservation?
There won't be any trouble.

01:28:39.915 --> 01:28:41.808
Okay.

01:31:16.087 --> 01:31:21.259
<i>They asked me how I knew</i>

01:31:21.384 --> 01:31:25.572
<i>My true love was true</i>

01:31:28.308 --> 01:31:31.811
<i>I, of course replied</i>

01:31:31.936 --> 01:31:35.482
<i>Something here inside</i>

01:31:35.607 --> 01:31:39.169
<i>Cannot be denied</i>

01:31:44.574 --> 01:31:49.996
<i>They said someday you'll find</i>

01:31:50.121 --> 01:31:54.267
<i>All who love are blind</i>

01:31:57.253 --> 01:32:01.007
<i>When you heart's on fire</i>

01:32:01.132 --> 01:32:04.552
<i>You must realize</i>

01:32:04.677 --> 01:32:09.073
<i>Smoke gets in your eyes</i>

01:32:13.770 --> 01:32:16.706
<i>So I chaffed them</i>

01:32:16.856 --> 01:32:20.251
<i>And I gaily laughed</i>

01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:25.882
<i>To think they could doubt my love</i>

01:32:28.576 --> 01:32:34.432
<i>Yet today, my love has flown away</i>

01:32:35.083 --> 01:32:41.064
<i>I am without my love</i>

01:32:43.258 --> 01:32:44.926
<i>Now</i>

01:32:45.051 --> 01:32:48.763
<i>Laughing friends deride</i>

01:32:48.888 --> 01:32:53.368
<i>Tears I cannot hide</i>

01:32:55.979 --> 01:32:59.832
<i>So I smile and say</i>

01:32:59.983 --> 01:33:03.336
<i>When a lovely flame dies</i>

01:33:03.486 --> 01:33:07.924
<i>Smokes gets in your eyes</i>

01:33:12.704 --> 01:33:15.556
<i>So I chaffed them</i>

01:33:15.707 --> 01:33:19.060
<i>And I gaily laughed</i>

01:33:19.502 --> 01:33:25.608
<i>To think they could doubt my love</i>

01:33:26.801 --> 01:33:30.571
<i>And yet today</i>

01:33:30.722 --> 01:33:34.409
<i>My love has flown away</i>

01:33:34.559 --> 01:33:39.998
<i>And I'm without my love</i>

01:33:42.608 --> 01:33:44.235
<i>Now</i>

01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:48.131
<i>Laughing friends deride</i>

01:33:48.281 --> 01:33:53.261
<i>Tears I cannot hide</i>

01:33:55.329 --> 01:33:59.334
<i>So I smile and say</i>

01:33:59.459 --> 01:34:04.605
<i>When a lovely flame dies</i>

01:34:04.756 --> 01:34:05.773
<i>Smokes gets in your eyes</i>
