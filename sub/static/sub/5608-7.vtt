WEBVTT

00:07.715 --> 00:09.449
NICKY:
Your 40th birthday, I mean...

00:09.827 --> 00:11.193
wow!

00:11.195 --> 00:12.861
Yeah, wow.

00:12.863 --> 00:14.163
You feel any different?

00:14.166 --> 00:16.533
Not yet.

00:16.534 --> 00:18.267
Well, you look amazing.

00:18.270 --> 00:19.803
We're on the phone.
You can't see me.

00:19.805 --> 00:21.638
I mean in general.

00:21.640 --> 00:22.806
You mean, for 40?

00:22.808 --> 00:24.641
For 30, even.

00:24.643 --> 00:25.942
(intercom rings)

00:25.944 --> 00:27.076
Somebody's buzzing.

00:27.078 --> 00:28.311
Hold on.

00:30.981 --> 00:33.783
(indistinct chatter)

00:33.785 --> 00:35.151
Officer Keith Roosevelt?

00:35.153 --> 00:36.419
Who wants to know?

00:36.421 --> 00:37.887
Detective Investigator Langraf,

00:37.889 --> 00:39.222
District Attorney's Squad.

00:39.224 --> 00:41.558
I'm inviting you down
to Central Booking.

00:41.560 --> 00:42.826
For what?

00:42.828 --> 00:44.294
To be charged
with official misconduct.

00:44.296 --> 00:45.695
JANKO: I'm not going anywhere!
What misconduct?

00:45.697 --> 00:47.497
Jamie? Reagan!

00:50.067 --> 00:51.534
Hey, what's going on?

00:51.536 --> 00:52.602
This clown

00:52.604 --> 00:54.370
is inviting me down
to Central Booking.

00:54.372 --> 00:55.371
I'm showing
you respect.

00:55.373 --> 00:57.841
How about you show me some?

00:57.843 --> 00:58.708
Charged with?

00:58.710 --> 00:59.676
Official misconduct

00:59.678 --> 01:00.743
and tampering
with public records.

01:00.745 --> 01:02.545
I call BS.
For what?

01:02.547 --> 01:03.913
Ticket-fixing.

01:03.915 --> 01:05.281
Do you know who
my partner's father is?

01:05.283 --> 01:06.883
Do you?
I can read,

01:06.885 --> 01:08.585
so I can guess.

01:08.587 --> 01:10.587
I bet I could guess
who his sister is, too.

01:11.455 --> 01:12.689
Now let's go.
Hey.

01:12.691 --> 01:14.591
You don't got to
treat her like a perp.

01:14.593 --> 01:15.792
Please.

01:17.862 --> 01:19.028
Let's not make
this any worse.

01:19.030 --> 01:20.330
I'm right behind you.

01:28.072 --> 01:29.539
He can't do that.

01:29.541 --> 01:31.507
Yes, he can.
He reviewed the evidence

01:31.509 --> 01:32.642
and decided you
didn't have enough

01:32.644 --> 01:33.943
on Sergeant Bauer
to indict him

01:33.945 --> 01:36.246
for conspiracy to possess
a controlled substance.

01:36.248 --> 01:37.947
Which is the whole reason
we had a wire up on him.

01:37.949 --> 01:39.015
I know.

01:39.017 --> 01:40.783
But the ancillary
stuff we harvested...

01:40.785 --> 01:42.418
Ticket-fixing is chump change.

01:42.420 --> 01:44.020
Not to the acting DA.

01:44.022 --> 01:45.755
He wanted some
scalps, period.

01:45.757 --> 01:46.856
So there are guys from the squad

01:46.858 --> 01:48.558
making collars
at the precinct as we speak.

01:48.560 --> 01:49.993
As we speak?

01:49.995 --> 01:51.127
I don't even get a heads-up?

01:51.129 --> 01:52.395
This is your heads-up.

01:52.397 --> 01:53.830
And you didn't
get this from me.

01:53.832 --> 01:56.065
He thought I was gonna
give the heads-up to the cops?

01:56.067 --> 01:58.801
This is between
you and him.

01:58.803 --> 02:00.069
Who you calling?

02:00.071 --> 02:01.104
Who do you think?

02:01.106 --> 02:02.105
Your old man?

02:02.107 --> 02:04.007
No, the DA.

02:04.009 --> 02:05.975
Then take a breath.
Why?

02:05.977 --> 02:07.176
Because you're too pissed off.

02:07.178 --> 02:09.044
It'd be like drinking
and dialing,

02:09.047 --> 02:12.215
and friends
don't let friends...

02:13.083 --> 02:14.384
So go get dressed

02:14.386 --> 02:15.785
and I'll give you a lift in.

02:18.489 --> 02:20.623
(sighs)

02:21.926 --> 02:23.726
You and your ADAs

02:23.728 --> 02:26.162
and the detectives of
your Investigations Squad

02:26.164 --> 02:27.664
are all way out
of line here,

02:27.666 --> 02:28.865
and this department

02:28.867 --> 02:30.667
expects and demands

02:30.669 --> 02:32.302
that you void those arrests

02:32.304 --> 02:33.970
and drop all the charges
immediately.

02:33.972 --> 02:35.805
(receiver crashes down)

02:35.807 --> 02:37.774
I'll give him an hour.

02:37.776 --> 02:39.309
I'll give him
a punch in the nose.

02:39.311 --> 02:40.843
No, you won't.

02:40.845 --> 02:42.078
You got through
that whole conversation

02:42.080 --> 02:43.379
without dropping
a single curse word.

02:43.381 --> 02:44.447
How the hell
do you do that?

02:44.449 --> 02:46.349
I was partially raised by nuns.

02:46.351 --> 02:47.884
I want you to go
down to Central Booking

02:47.886 --> 02:49.585
and make sure our officers

02:49.587 --> 02:51.287
make no statements to the press.

02:51.289 --> 02:54.190
What happens in an hour,
when this good-for-nothing

02:54.192 --> 02:55.658
hasn't done a thing
to walk it back?

02:57.094 --> 02:58.361
You got a crystal ball,
Detective?

02:58.363 --> 02:59.429
BAKER:
No, sir.

02:59.431 --> 03:00.930
Just an informed opinion

03:00.932 --> 03:02.098
about the acting DA.

03:02.100 --> 03:04.300
Then check with me in an hour.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:18.782 --> 03:19.983
How'd it go?

03:19.985 --> 03:22.085
Our acting DA's gone
right off the rails,

03:22.087 --> 03:24.053
down an embankment,
through an orphanage

03:24.055 --> 03:26.356
and smack into the gas pumps.

03:26.358 --> 03:28.291
Told you I should've come.

03:28.293 --> 03:30.660
Wouldn't have made
a lick of difference.

03:30.662 --> 03:32.862
You know he's asking me to be
the office's face on this thing?

03:32.864 --> 03:33.796
Can you imagine?

03:33.798 --> 03:35.031
What'd he say?

03:35.033 --> 03:38.501
That it's--
and I'm basically quoting here--

03:38.503 --> 03:40.003
"your golden opportunity

03:40.005 --> 03:41.571
"to show this office
and this city

03:41.573 --> 03:43.606
"that you can wear
the blindfold of justice

03:43.608 --> 03:45.975
where the NYPD is concerned."

03:45.977 --> 03:47.643
He's right.

03:47.645 --> 03:49.579
He's right?

03:49.581 --> 03:50.780
Yes.

03:51.648 --> 03:52.949
Listen to me for a minute.

03:52.951 --> 03:55.284
No.
Yes.

03:55.286 --> 03:56.953
Do you have any idea
how many cases

03:56.955 --> 03:59.255
are routed around your desk
because of your family ties?

03:59.257 --> 04:01.057
I just took on a cop!

04:01.059 --> 04:02.625
The wires that got us into this

04:02.627 --> 04:04.293
were up because of
my investigation!

04:04.295 --> 04:06.229
I don't have proof, but I'm
guessing he put you on it

04:06.231 --> 04:07.764
as some kind of test.

04:08.632 --> 04:10.400
Find out once and for all.

04:10.402 --> 04:13.503
So,  that logic, I'm beholden

04:13.505 --> 04:15.071
to prosecute beat cops

04:15.073 --> 04:17.140
for pulling friends and family
tickets off the pile?

04:17.142 --> 04:18.408
A perk that goes

04:18.410 --> 04:21.010
back well into the last century,
at least?

04:21.012 --> 04:22.111
Come on, Erin.

04:22.113 --> 04:23.312
Shift your weight.

04:23.314 --> 04:24.580
What if this is the DA's version

04:24.582 --> 04:25.982
of your father's
broken windows policy?

04:25.984 --> 04:27.483
That nipping crime

04:27.485 --> 04:28.651
at the lowest levels

04:28.653 --> 04:29.886
deters more serious stuff?

04:29.888 --> 04:32.955
We're talking
about summonses here.

04:32.957 --> 04:34.157
It's still official misconduct

04:34.159 --> 04:35.591
and tampering
with public records.

04:35.593 --> 04:37.460
I'm on your side,

04:37.462 --> 04:39.028
but if you back away from this,

04:39.030 --> 04:40.430
you'll be hanging a sign
from the door that says

04:40.432 --> 04:43.733
"Erin Reagan, Department
of Selective Justice."

04:49.807 --> 04:51.140
So I hit the lights
and leaned in.

04:51.142 --> 04:52.542
Saw the one guy for,
like, a split second,

04:52.544 --> 04:54.577
pulling the cover
off the car.

04:54.579 --> 04:56.045
Then the second one--
or however many--

04:56.047 --> 04:57.280
hit me from behind.

04:57.282 --> 04:59.215
Okay, but you say you got
a good look at the one guy?

04:59.217 --> 05:01.517
A good look at a guy with
a stocking over his head.

05:01.519 --> 05:02.819
About my height,

05:02.821 --> 05:03.953
T-shirt and cargo shorts.

05:03.955 --> 05:05.288
You said "however many."

05:05.290 --> 05:06.556
How come?

05:06.558 --> 05:08.558
They taped my mouth and eyes
so I-I couldn't see,

05:08.560 --> 05:10.059
but I could
sort of hear.

05:10.061 --> 05:12.195
Not sure if it was
two voices or more.

05:16.500 --> 05:18.267
It's true?

05:18.269 --> 05:19.168
Who are you?

05:19.170 --> 05:20.169
I'm Owen Cairo.

05:20.171 --> 05:21.337
I-I rent this unit.

05:21.339 --> 05:22.472
What did you do?

05:22.474 --> 05:23.873
How could you let
this happen?

05:23.875 --> 05:25.174
Don't you have a gun?

05:25.176 --> 05:26.375
BAEZ:
Okay, Mr. Cairo.

05:26.377 --> 05:27.710
Look, there's been a robbery.

05:27.712 --> 05:29.645
That's why I'm here!

05:29.647 --> 05:31.347
Only thing appears
to be missing

05:31.349 --> 05:32.615
is a 1968 Ford.

05:32.617 --> 05:34.350
The only thing?

05:35.052 --> 05:36.853
It's the whole thing!

05:36.855 --> 05:38.187
Well, I don't follow you.

05:38.189 --> 05:40.590
That '68 Ford

05:40.592 --> 05:43.526
is the Mustang that
Steve McQueen drove in <i>Bullitt.</i>

05:45.696 --> 05:47.396
You do know <i>Bullitt,</i> Detective?

05:47.398 --> 05:48.564
Of course I do.

05:48.566 --> 05:49.765
It's the greatest
car chase ever filmed.

05:49.767 --> 05:52.535
Then you know that
the car McQueen drove in,

05:52.537 --> 05:55.138
it is, to millions of men,

05:55.140 --> 05:56.706
the stuff that
dreams are made of.

05:56.708 --> 05:57.974
Yeah, I'm with you on that.

05:57.976 --> 05:59.709
Not to mention,
probably worth millions.

05:59.711 --> 06:01.077
CAIRO:
Yes.

06:01.079 --> 06:03.346
And no one knows how many.

06:03.348 --> 06:05.648
And now it's gone!

06:05.650 --> 06:07.116
(groaning)

06:10.521 --> 06:12.622
<i>Bullitt</i> Mustang.

and it's been
in the family ever since.

06:51.540 --> 06:53.974
Hidden away, out of sight?

06:53.976 --> 06:56.076
That was my
father's wishes.

06:56.078 --> 06:57.044
Why?

06:57.046 --> 06:58.846
Why keep
such a beautiful machine

06:58.848 --> 07:00.314
away from the rest of the world?

07:00.316 --> 07:02.816
That secret died with him.

07:02.818 --> 07:04.184
(sighs)

07:04.186 --> 07:05.786
But his will was very specific

07:05.788 --> 07:09.390
as to the use
of the <i>Bullitt</i> Mustang.

07:09.392 --> 07:11.225
Namely, no use at all?

07:11.227 --> 07:13.660
Except for it to be driven

07:13.662 --> 07:16.397
under the cover of night
for an hour every week.

07:16.399 --> 07:17.931
Warm up the gaskets
and fluids,

07:17.933 --> 07:21.335
keep it in its original
operating state.

07:21.337 --> 07:22.770
Driven by...?

07:22.772 --> 07:24.371
For the last 20 years, me.

07:24.373 --> 07:26.040
You and...?

07:26.042 --> 07:27.341
No one.

07:27.343 --> 07:29.676
I gave a few rides, but...

07:29.678 --> 07:31.345
I was the only driver.

07:31.347 --> 07:32.413
DANNY:
Does anybody else

07:32.415 --> 07:34.915
in the world know where

07:34.917 --> 07:36.250
or exactly what this machine is?

07:36.252 --> 07:37.818
A few.

07:37.820 --> 07:39.686
I can give you their names,

07:39.688 --> 07:42.689
but, well, there's one
on the very top of the list.

07:42.691 --> 07:43.891
Okay.

07:43.893 --> 07:47.061
Well, we contacted
some experts from Major Case.

07:47.063 --> 07:49.363
Should be here
in about five, ten minutes.

07:49.365 --> 07:50.898
We'll take a break till then,
and you can talk to them.

07:50.900 --> 07:52.933
No.

07:52.935 --> 07:54.134
No,

07:54.136 --> 07:55.869
you have to handle this.

07:55.871 --> 07:57.071
Just... just the two of you.

07:57.073 --> 07:58.906
You need an expert
to handle this.

07:58.908 --> 08:00.941
This is the Mona Lisa of cars.

08:00.943 --> 08:02.009
No.

08:02.011 --> 08:04.778
Uh, i-if other people
get involved,

08:04.780 --> 08:06.313
it could get out.

08:06.315 --> 08:07.981
We have kept this

08:07.983 --> 08:10.984
a secret for a very long time,
Detectives.

08:10.986 --> 08:13.053
Please. I don't want to shine

08:13.055 --> 08:15.722
a spotlight on my family

08:15.724 --> 08:17.724
on top of all of this.

08:20.628 --> 08:22.629
Who's the person at
the top of your list?

08:22.631 --> 08:24.131
My wife.

08:24.133 --> 08:25.132
Sybil.

08:25.134 --> 08:28.168
Okay. Go on.

08:28.170 --> 08:31.538
Our prenup stipulates

08:31.540 --> 08:33.974
that if the marriage doesn't
last more than ten years,

08:33.976 --> 08:35.476
she gets nothing.

08:35.477 --> 08:37.010
You've been married how long?

08:37.011 --> 08:38.345
Six.

08:39.313 --> 08:41.248
She's having an affair.

08:43.083 --> 08:44.952
And so it makes sense

08:44.954 --> 08:46.887
that she would arrange for

08:46.889 --> 08:49.456
the sale of the Mustang,
sub Rosa,

08:49.458 --> 08:52.226
and be able to walk away

08:52.228 --> 08:55.095
with substantially more
than nothing.

08:55.097 --> 08:57.030
You <i>know</i> she's having an affair?

08:57.032 --> 08:58.265
She's supposed to be

08:58.267 --> 09:01.502
in St. Maarten with
her girlfriends this weekend

09:01.504 --> 09:03.137
and I know for a fact

09:03.139 --> 09:06.673
that she's holed up
in a hotel here in town.

09:08.510 --> 09:10.978
I had her...

09:10.980 --> 09:12.179
Followed?

09:13.515 --> 09:15.215
She's young

09:15.217 --> 09:16.950
and beautiful,

09:16.952 --> 09:19.353
and I am getting older

09:19.355 --> 09:22.289
and more invisible every day.

09:29.998 --> 09:31.565
ERIN:
And I want to underline

09:31.567 --> 09:34.301
that the stance of
this acting district attorney

09:34.303 --> 09:36.236
and the ADAs on this case

09:36.238 --> 09:38.505
is that the officers
are innocent

09:38.507 --> 09:40.841
unless and until proven guilty,

09:40.843 --> 09:42.276
and that there is no agenda here

09:42.278 --> 09:45.012
other than carrying out
our duties

09:45.014 --> 09:47.447
wearing the blindfold
of justice.

09:47.449 --> 09:49.516
Ms. Reagan, can you confirm
that these charges

09:49.518 --> 09:51.852
grew out of wiretaps
that you had warranted

09:51.854 --> 09:55.088
based on a more serious
corruption investigation?

09:55.090 --> 09:57.724
I cannot comment
on other investigations

09:57.726 --> 09:59.526
as they do or do not relate

09:59.528 --> 10:02.796
to the officers
charged in this case.

10:02.798 --> 10:04.364
So you had wires up on beat cops

10:04.366 --> 10:08.535
trying to nail them
for Mickey Mouse ticket-fixing?

10:08.537 --> 10:10.337
<i>I'll send him a nice bottle...</i>
<i>Please.</i>

10:10.339 --> 10:11.638
ERIN: That's the acting DA's
statement and not mine.

10:11.640 --> 10:13.440
But I would like to add
that I, and this office,

10:13.442 --> 10:16.443
have nothing but respect
for Commissioner Reagan

10:16.445 --> 10:17.911
and the department he commands.

10:17.913 --> 10:20.214
Hell of a way of showing it.

10:20.216 --> 10:21.748
That's all for now. Thank you.

10:24.352 --> 10:25.752
We need to craft

10:25.754 --> 10:27.054
a statement in response.

10:27.056 --> 10:28.789
I know that.

10:28.791 --> 10:30.190
Do you want to write it?

10:31.059 --> 10:33.427
No, that's your job.

10:33.429 --> 10:35.829
Especially today.

10:37.198 --> 10:38.732
I'll get on right it.

10:38.734 --> 10:40.100
We have to be bigger than them.

10:40.102 --> 10:41.201
Okay.

10:41.203 --> 10:42.236
We could lay our response

10:42.238 --> 10:44.332
at the acting DA's feet, but then...
Good idea.

10:44.333 --> 10:45.640
Leave her out of it.
...it would look like

10:45.641 --> 10:48.075
I'm assuming that
she's just following orders...

10:48.077 --> 10:49.977
It could.
...instead of standing up

10:49.979 --> 10:51.278
on her own two feet

10:51.280 --> 10:53.447
and saying what's
on her own mind.

10:53.449 --> 10:55.182
Which you'd want to communicate.
But as importantly,

10:55.184 --> 10:56.850
I don't want a single
one of our people

10:56.852 --> 11:00.821
assuming that I would
hold back on my response

11:00.823 --> 11:02.422
because she's involved.

11:02.424 --> 11:03.890
That, too.

11:03.892 --> 11:06.293
Let me get a draft started.

11:08.730 --> 11:11.231
I'm sorry about this, boss.

11:11.233 --> 11:14.668
Me, too.

11:16.671 --> 11:19.873
Baker, did ADA Reagan
return my call yet?

11:19.875 --> 11:22.209
Not as of yet, sir.

11:23.411 --> 11:25.412
Could you try her again?

11:25.414 --> 11:27.714
Yes, sir.

11:36.157 --> 11:38.625
JANKO:
<i>Name's Ruth.</i>

11:38.627 --> 11:41.128
<i>She lives in my building.</i>

11:41.130 --> 11:42.262
She's, like, in her 80s?

11:42.264 --> 11:44.331
She still takes pride
in the fact that she drives.

11:44.333 --> 11:46.633
She's a great old broad.

11:46.635 --> 11:48.468
Hilarious.

11:48.470 --> 11:50.871
So I move her car for her on
alternate side parking days.

11:50.873 --> 11:52.873
And a couple times,
I was late to the chore.

11:52.875 --> 11:54.107
Ticket on the windshield.

11:54.109 --> 11:55.175
Yeah, 90 bucks.

11:55.177 --> 11:56.743
If she had
that kind of money,

11:56.745 --> 11:58.412
she'd rent a monthly space.

11:58.414 --> 11:59.613
So you pulled them.

11:59.615 --> 12:00.847
Yeah, wouldn't you?

12:00.849 --> 12:01.982
I would.

12:01.984 --> 12:05.319
As anybody
in our shoes would.

12:07.922 --> 12:08.855
That's the one.

12:08.857 --> 12:09.856
The one what?

12:09.858 --> 12:11.058
The one we want.

12:11.060 --> 12:12.326
Judge Schlossberg.

12:12.328 --> 12:14.561
Uncle and patron
of the acting DA.

12:14.563 --> 12:16.029
Well, he hasn't
done anything.

12:16.031 --> 12:17.264
Not yet.

12:17.266 --> 12:18.131
What are you up to?

12:18.133 --> 12:19.833
Little payback?

12:23.471 --> 12:25.605
Hollywood stop.

12:25.607 --> 12:27.107
That's a violation.

12:27.109 --> 12:28.642
(siren wails)

12:28.644 --> 12:31.578
JANKO:
<i>Well, look at you, Reagan.</i>

12:33.281 --> 12:34.614
(grunts)

12:34.616 --> 12:37.684
Sir, get back
in the car, please.

12:37.686 --> 12:40.587
I'm sorry, Officers,
did you read my license plate?

12:40.589 --> 12:42.622
Yeah, we did read
your license plate.

12:42.624 --> 12:43.857
Did you read the stop sign?

12:43.859 --> 12:44.858
Are you kidding?!

12:44.860 --> 12:45.859
Oh, afraid not,

12:45.861 --> 12:47.294
Your Honor.

12:47.296 --> 12:49.830
Son, can you get a handle on
your cute little partner here?

12:49.832 --> 12:51.665
Sir, she's simply
pointing out

12:51.667 --> 12:53.633
your moving violation,
as is her job.

12:53.635 --> 12:54.701
I didn't break any law.

12:54.703 --> 12:57.070
You rolled through
the stop sign.

12:58.473 --> 13:01.141
Reagan, as in Frank?

13:01.143 --> 13:03.477
He's my father, yes,
and ADA Erin Reagan's

13:03.479 --> 13:05.379
my sister, who works
for your nephew,

13:05.381 --> 13:08.148
who opened up this particular
can of worms this morning.

13:08.150 --> 13:10.517
You got a beef, I suggest
you take it up with him.

13:10.519 --> 13:12.085
This is harassment,
Officer Reagan.

13:12.087 --> 13:14.187
No, this was a routine
traffic stop, sir.

13:14.189 --> 13:15.822
Strictly by the book.

13:17.091 --> 13:20.193
Have a good day.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.961
You have to understand
this is a boutique hotel.

13:38.962 --> 13:40.695
Got it.
With a reputation

13:40.697 --> 13:42.631
for utmost discretion.

13:42.633 --> 13:43.899
Got it.

13:43.901 --> 13:45.133
I'll be discreet,
I promise.

13:45.135 --> 13:47.569
I left my bullhorn
and machine gun in the car.

13:47.571 --> 13:48.703
(knocking)

13:48.705 --> 13:49.771
(shushes)

13:49.773 --> 13:51.006
Police!

13:51.008 --> 13:52.474
Open up!

13:52.476 --> 13:54.943
Mrs. Cairo,
open up!

13:54.945 --> 13:58.680
Okay, would you do your thing,
Mr., uh, Kyle?

13:59.615 --> 14:01.750
(lock beeps)

14:01.752 --> 14:03.952
(music playing loudly)

14:04.954 --> 14:07.222
Mrs. Cairo?

14:07.224 --> 14:08.790
Detective Reagan.

14:14.931 --> 14:15.931
(music shuts off)

14:15.933 --> 14:17.332
Just want to ask you
a few questions.

14:17.334 --> 14:20.235
You have no right!
Hey! Hey!

14:20.237 --> 14:22.270
I'm a detective!

14:22.272 --> 14:23.605
So, my husband had
me followed again?!

14:23.607 --> 14:24.940
Well, you tell him
he's wasting his time.

14:24.942 --> 14:27.409
I'm a detective.

14:27.411 --> 14:30.378
Detective Reagan, NYPD.

14:30.380 --> 14:32.580
You're a police detective.

14:34.083 --> 14:35.583
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

14:35.585 --> 14:36.818
Geez, are you okay?

14:36.820 --> 14:39.154
Yeah, I'm okay.
You missed.

14:40.089 --> 14:41.556
Is anybody else in that bedroom?

14:41.558 --> 14:43.792
No.

14:45.494 --> 14:48.196
How about you--
are you all right?

14:48.198 --> 14:49.864
I'm not supposed
to be on my feet.

14:49.866 --> 14:51.866
I just had my boobs,
ass and tummy done.

14:51.868 --> 14:53.601
Oh.

14:53.603 --> 14:56.438
And I had nothing to do with
that damn car going missing.

14:56.440 --> 14:58.840
Assuming that's why you're here.

15:01.944 --> 15:04.846
A 1968 Mustang 390 GT,

15:04.848 --> 15:08.817
fastback, highland green
with vintage California plates.

15:08.819 --> 15:11.286
Detective Baez.

15:11.288 --> 15:13.755
Boy, Adam, Edward, Zebra.

15:13.757 --> 15:15.156
If you hear anything,

15:15.158 --> 15:17.092
I'd really appreciate
a call back.

15:17.094 --> 15:18.360
Thank you.

15:18.362 --> 15:20.328
Alert an outfit
called Horseless Carriage.

15:20.330 --> 15:22.163
They transport most
of the valuable automobiles

15:22.165 --> 15:23.498
in this country.

15:23.500 --> 15:25.767
I was just on with them.

15:25.769 --> 15:26.901
Good for you.

15:26.903 --> 15:28.536
And who are you?

15:28.538 --> 15:29.938
Sam Guttman.

15:29.940 --> 15:32.340
I'm a rare automobile broker...

15:32.342 --> 15:33.908
with a keen interest

15:33.910 --> 15:36.244
in the car you're
trying to find.

15:36.246 --> 15:38.146
I'm not sure it's for sale.

15:38.148 --> 15:40.915
Everything's for sale
for the right price.

15:40.917 --> 15:43.585
May I sit?

15:46.422 --> 15:48.723
How did you know to look me up?

15:48.725 --> 15:51.393
That's not important.

15:51.395 --> 15:52.460
It is to me.

15:52.462 --> 15:53.995
No laws were broken, Detective.

15:53.997 --> 15:55.296
Can we leave it at that?

15:55.298 --> 15:57.165
Do you all talk to each other?

15:57.167 --> 15:58.500
About something like this?

15:58.502 --> 16:00.168
My, yes.

16:00.170 --> 16:01.803
So, do you have anything for me?

16:01.805 --> 16:03.872
Got a trade.

16:03.874 --> 16:07.175
Well, if it helps me
solve this case.

16:07.177 --> 16:09.210
I'll tell you what I have.

16:09.212 --> 16:10.445
Opportunity.

16:10.447 --> 16:11.713
If you can
provide me contact

16:11.715 --> 16:14.816
with the current possessor
of the <i>Bullitt</i> Mustang,

16:14.818 --> 16:16.451
and it results
my brokering a purchase,

16:16.453 --> 16:18.686
I'd give you 20%
of my commission.

16:18.688 --> 16:21.256
I'm trying to catch the guy,
not help him.

16:21.258 --> 16:23.258
And I'm not for sale.

16:23.260 --> 16:24.592
Of course not.

16:26.095 --> 16:28.296
But consider this.

16:34.103 --> 16:36.638
Money like that
buys some piece of mind.

16:36.640 --> 16:39.841
With plenty left over
for rationale.

16:43.813 --> 16:46.981
You call me if you learn
of anything, Mr. Guttman.

16:46.983 --> 16:48.283
And if you do

16:48.285 --> 16:49.584
and you don't call me,

16:49.586 --> 16:52.420
you'll be buying yourself
a whole lot of trouble.

16:55.091 --> 16:56.491
Can you show him the door?

16:57.593 --> 17:00.128
I will be seeing you.

17:04.066 --> 17:05.333
A few people for a ride?

17:05.335 --> 17:06.267
Yeah.

17:06.269 --> 17:07.702
Owen's BS-ing you there.

17:07.704 --> 17:08.837
It was a lot
more people than that.

17:08.839 --> 17:10.939
And some he'd only met,
like, once.

17:10.941 --> 17:12.540
Oh.

17:12.541 --> 17:13.907
I warned him.

17:13.910 --> 17:15.977
Why would he mislead us?

17:15.979 --> 17:18.012
You got to understand
my husband, Detective.

17:18.013 --> 17:19.347
He was that kid, you know,

17:19.348 --> 17:21.182
had his parents
throw his birthday party

17:21.184 --> 17:23.084
at the go-kart track
or the paintball park,

17:23.086 --> 17:24.786
'cause he was afraid
if it was just his party,

17:24.788 --> 17:26.054
no one would come.

17:26.056 --> 17:27.489
Insecure.

17:27.491 --> 17:28.522
Times a hundred!

17:28.525 --> 17:30.158
Aha.

17:30.160 --> 17:31.893
I'm so sick of having
people following me,

17:31.895 --> 17:34.229
but I know where it comes from.

17:34.231 --> 17:36.598
The no self-esteem in him.

17:36.600 --> 17:37.732
So I put up with it.

17:37.734 --> 17:38.867
And you did
all this work,

17:38.869 --> 17:41.169
but you still plan
on staying with him?

17:41.171 --> 17:42.737
I did it for Owen.

17:42.739 --> 17:44.405
I'm not going anywhere.

17:44.407 --> 17:46.374
Then why'd you tell him
you were going to St. Maarten?

17:46.376 --> 17:47.675
(short laugh)

17:47.677 --> 17:50.078
I wanted to surprise him.

17:50.080 --> 17:53.414
I didn't think the private eye
would stick around the airport.

17:53.416 --> 17:54.549
(sighs)

17:54.551 --> 17:56.484
If you'll excuse me,

17:56.486 --> 17:58.686
it's time for my pill,
which means another nap.

18:02.424 --> 18:03.925
Detective?

18:03.927 --> 18:05.460
I love my husband.

18:05.462 --> 18:07.695
But you're gonna need
to be tough with him.

18:07.697 --> 18:09.731
He's probably embarrassed
about how many people

18:09.733 --> 18:12.534
he took to go look
at that stupid car of his.

18:12.536 --> 18:15.670
How little he knew
about most of them.

18:15.672 --> 18:17.038
I will.

18:17.040 --> 18:20.742
There's just one thing
I don't quite get.

18:20.744 --> 18:22.577
I'm happy to help if I can.

18:22.579 --> 18:23.912
You and Mr. Cairo,

18:23.914 --> 18:26.848
you're kind of an unusual match.

18:26.850 --> 18:28.850
You mean what's a chick like me

18:28.852 --> 18:31.219
doing with one
of the Brooks Brothers?

18:31.221 --> 18:32.787
Like that, yeah.

18:32.789 --> 18:36.391
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be a country vet.

18:36.393 --> 18:39.694
A little older,
a Doctor Without Borders.

18:39.696 --> 18:41.930
But both of those
take medical school,

18:41.932 --> 18:44.232
and I was never much for school;
ask anyone.

18:44.234 --> 18:46.668
Right.
And then I met Owen,

18:46.670 --> 18:48.536
who's very smart

18:48.538 --> 18:50.705
and... has a heart of gold

18:50.707 --> 18:53.575
by the way, and...

18:53.577 --> 18:56.911
I realized I had someone
to heal and nurture

18:56.913 --> 19:00.181
for the rest of my life.

19:02.418 --> 19:04.986
Leave your card on the table,

19:04.988 --> 19:08.423
and I'll be in touch
if I think of anything.

19:08.425 --> 19:10.592
Will do.

19:13.596 --> 19:14.762
(knocking)

19:14.764 --> 19:16.331
ALEX:
So, one of the cops arrested

19:16.333 --> 19:18.433
at the 12th was
your brother's partner.

19:18.435 --> 19:19.934
Yeah, Eddie.
I saw the list.

19:19.936 --> 19:22.003
A couple hours ago,
they ticketed Judge Schlossberg

19:22.005 --> 19:23.204
for a Hollywood stop

19:23.206 --> 19:24.839
outside the parking lot.

19:24.841 --> 19:26.140
Janko and your brother.

19:26.142 --> 19:27.375
Was it a bad stop?

19:27.377 --> 19:28.710
It doesn't matter-- the judge is

19:28.712 --> 19:30.211
characterizing it
as harassment and retaliation.

19:30.213 --> 19:31.779
Apparently he
called his nephew

19:31.781 --> 19:33.548
and offered to
supply the books

19:33.550 --> 19:35.083
to throw at these accused cops.

19:35.085 --> 19:37.552
So now everyone's just going,
"This means war"?

19:37.554 --> 19:39.254
Did you talk to your old man?

19:39.256 --> 19:40.922
Just for a second.

19:40.924 --> 19:42.924
I'm going over there
after I get out of here.

19:42.926 --> 19:44.859
Also, the arresting detectives
from the squad

19:44.861 --> 19:46.628
need ten minutes with you

19:46.630 --> 19:48.296
to go over the grand
jury strategies

19:48.298 --> 19:50.031
on the charged cops,
if you're up for it.

19:50.033 --> 19:52.900
I'm not really up
for any of this.

19:52.902 --> 19:55.536
The conference room
in the DA's office.

19:55.538 --> 19:57.772
Come on.

19:57.774 --> 19:59.274
And just for the record,

19:59.276 --> 20:00.608
anybody who asks, I told them
you jumped at the chance

20:00.610 --> 20:02.710
when the DA asked you
to take the lead on this.

20:02.712 --> 20:03.745
Who asked?

20:03.747 --> 20:04.912
More than you think.

20:04.914 --> 20:06.180
Because?

20:06.182 --> 20:08.716
Because no one
expected you to.

20:08.718 --> 20:10.118
Where is everyone?

20:10.120 --> 20:12.320
It's not even 6:00.

20:12.322 --> 20:13.988
Hmm.

20:13.990 --> 20:15.823
There aren't
detectives in there.

20:15.825 --> 20:18.126
That's a surprise party
for my 40th.

20:18.128 --> 20:19.694
I am not in the mood
for this.

20:19.696 --> 20:21.095
I am not going in there.

20:21.097 --> 20:22.530
I'd just be a wet blanket.

20:22.532 --> 20:23.698
Then you just fake it.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.066
You got a bunch
of your colleagues in there

20:25.068 --> 20:26.334
that really want to wish you
a happy birthday,

20:26.336 --> 20:27.368
especially on this one.

20:27.370 --> 20:28.703
Why, 'cause it's my 40th?

20:28.705 --> 20:30.838
And your own Independence Day
in a lot of their eyes,

20:30.840 --> 20:32.240
so come on.
I don't--

20:32.242 --> 20:33.441
Alex, I don't, I don't want to.
Come on, Erin, Erin.

20:33.443 --> 20:35.610
Alex, stop it!
Too-too bad.

20:35.612 --> 20:37.612
(clears his throat)

20:40.115 --> 20:42.183
ALL:
Surprise!

20:43.385 --> 20:45.086
Wow!
(laughs)

20:45.088 --> 20:46.487
Oh, my God!

20:46.489 --> 20:48.823
Thank you.

20:48.825 --> 20:51.592
Thank you, thank you.

20:51.594 --> 20:53.294
(chuckles)

20:55.698 --> 20:57.899
Jean, go home.

20:59.635 --> 21:00.968
FRANK:
Independence Day?

21:00.970 --> 21:02.270
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

21:02.272 --> 21:03.938
ERIN: It means there's
a lot of people

21:03.940 --> 21:06.107
who didn't think I
could or would do it.

21:06.109 --> 21:08.142
That is
so incredibly misguided,

21:08.144 --> 21:10.144
I don't know
where to start.

21:10.146 --> 21:11.679
No it's not, Dad.
Don't play dumb.

21:11.681 --> 21:14.349
The opposite-- I'm trying
to be smart enough to understand

21:14.351 --> 21:16.317
why you'd let yourself
get roped into this.

21:16.319 --> 21:18.052
I didn't get roped into it.

21:18.054 --> 21:19.620
I was asked,
I thought about it,

21:19.622 --> 21:20.788
I said yes.

21:20.790 --> 21:22.890
It was your idea
to arrest those cops?

21:22.892 --> 21:24.258
I didn't say that.

21:24.260 --> 21:26.928
So, the acting DA comes
to you after the fact

21:26.930 --> 21:28.329
and shames you

21:28.331 --> 21:29.764
into taking the lead
in this charade,

21:29.766 --> 21:31.899
otherwise you look soft on cops.

21:31.901 --> 21:33.401
That is not how it happened.

21:33.403 --> 21:35.470
Well, pretty damn close.

21:35.472 --> 21:38.539
Can you just please
listen to me for once?!

21:39.942 --> 21:42.343
Yeah, sure.

21:42.345 --> 21:44.545
I can listen.

21:46.348 --> 21:47.548
I was given a choice...

21:47.550 --> 21:49.117
And comparing this
to broken windows--

21:49.119 --> 21:51.018
what the hell is that?!

21:51.020 --> 21:52.687
We have mountains
of data suggesting

21:52.689 --> 21:55.189
there is
a direct correlation

21:55.191 --> 21:57.158
between targeting
lower level crimes

21:57.160 --> 21:59.427
to prevent bigger ones
from ever happening!

21:59.429 --> 22:00.728
It wasn't my analogy.

22:00.730 --> 22:02.530
And there's
not one iota

22:02.532 --> 22:04.632
of evidence suggesting
collaring cops

22:04.634 --> 22:06.601
to squash a summons

22:06.603 --> 22:10.238
has any effect eradicating
corruption at higher levels!

22:10.240 --> 22:11.439
I didn't say it.

22:11.441 --> 22:13.775
Well, you danced around it.

22:13.777 --> 22:15.443
Well, what the hell
was I supposed to do?

22:15.445 --> 22:17.111
Like you've never
coughed up some jive

22:17.113 --> 22:19.547
on account the mayor liked
the way it sounded?

22:20.849 --> 22:23.217
Now, I don't want
to fight with you,

22:23.219 --> 22:25.620
but I am not gonna take
a lesson from you here either.

22:25.622 --> 22:28.623
I will tell you in private
what I said in public.

22:28.625 --> 22:31.859
I have nothing but respect
for you and this department.

22:31.861 --> 22:33.728
You have a hell
of a way of showing it...

22:33.730 --> 22:37.098
But this DA's office,
and this particular ADA,

22:37.100 --> 22:39.367
also has a duty, a license,

22:39.369 --> 22:42.003
and the full support
of the rule of law

22:42.005 --> 22:45.239
to call 'em like we see it,
even if the perps wear blue

22:45.241 --> 22:47.208
and hide behind that old skirt

22:47.210 --> 22:50.178
of a long
and cherished tradition.

22:52.948 --> 22:56.951
You know... I never
thought I'd say this,

22:56.953 --> 22:58.686
but I heard contempt
in your voice.

22:58.688 --> 23:01.722
No, Dad, you hear your daughter
unable and unwilling

23:01.724 --> 23:03.357
to see it your way.

23:03.359 --> 23:05.927
And I don't enjoy it either,
but there it is.

23:12.634 --> 23:16.370
I have my birthday
dinner with Nicky.

23:16.372 --> 23:18.239
I'm gonna be late.

23:19.408 --> 23:21.042
Where are you going?

23:21.044 --> 23:24.712
Apparently cheap
and delicious Cuban-Chinese

23:24.714 --> 23:27.381
is making a comeback
in Morningside Heights.

23:27.383 --> 23:30.117
She's insisting
on treating, so...

23:31.920 --> 23:34.121
So.

23:36.191 --> 23:38.359
Well...

23:43.098 --> 23:44.732
Happy birthday.

23:44.734 --> 23:46.534
Thanks, Dad.

23:51.907 --> 23:53.774
Wait!

23:57.279 --> 23:59.480
(mutters)

24:11.754 --> 24:13.055
All right, settle down.

24:14.324 --> 24:16.692
I think you all know
why he's here.

24:16.694 --> 24:20.896
So with no further ado, our
union president, Johnny Lyons.

24:26.069 --> 24:28.704
So, this is what
the criminal class looks like.

24:28.706 --> 24:31.006
(officers chuckle)

24:31.008 --> 24:32.975
Hey, you know that movie
<i>The Untouchables?</i>

24:32.977 --> 24:35.978
Sean Connery goes, "He sends
one of yours to the hospital,

24:35.980 --> 24:37.713
"you send one of his
to the morgue.

24:37.715 --> 24:39.448
That-That's the Chicago way."

24:39.450 --> 24:43.118
Well, they send some of ours
to Central Booking,

24:43.120 --> 24:46.788
so we'll send all of theirs
to caseload hell.

24:46.790 --> 24:49.524
And that is the NYPD way, right?
(officers chatter in affirmation)

24:49.526 --> 24:52.995
Oh, and how about this,
Mr. Acting District Attorney?

24:52.997 --> 24:55.330
Anything less than
a Class A felony,

24:55.332 --> 24:58.467
and our guys can't make it
to your courts to testify.

24:58.469 --> 25:01.536
Yeah, you want to treat us like
a bunch of third-grade kids.

25:01.538 --> 25:04.873
Let's see how those wheels
of justice turn without us.

25:04.875 --> 25:07.109
Now, are you with me?
(officers affirm)

25:07.111 --> 25:09.011
Are you with me?
(officers affirm again)

25:09.013 --> 25:12.648
No. I am not.

25:13.916 --> 25:15.150
Ten-hut!

25:22.025 --> 25:24.993
Hello, Johnny.

25:24.995 --> 25:27.796
An unexpected pleasure,
Commissioner.

25:27.798 --> 25:30.032
Emphasis on "unexpected."

25:30.034 --> 25:31.466
You've got that right.

25:31.468 --> 25:34.269
As you were.

25:36.572 --> 25:38.840
I'm as mad as you are

25:38.842 --> 25:41.843
that the DA's office
disrespected us this way,

25:41.845 --> 25:45.180
but I do not want to hear
another word about a blue flu.

25:45.182 --> 25:46.448
Understood?

25:46.450 --> 25:47.816
OFFICERS:
Yes, sir.

25:47.818 --> 25:49.017
Understood?

25:49.019 --> 25:50.485
OFFICERS:
Yes, sir!

25:50.487 --> 25:52.788
Officer Janko, step forward.

26:01.364 --> 26:03.532
Squash some summonses, did you?

26:05.668 --> 26:06.868
Don't answer.

26:09.172 --> 26:13.108
If you did, would it have been
to line your own pockets?

26:13.976 --> 26:15.777
No, sir.

26:15.779 --> 26:18.280
Would you have personally
profited in any way?

26:18.282 --> 26:20.449
JANKO:
No, sir.

26:20.451 --> 26:22.551
Let's say there's
an old lady in my building,

26:22.553 --> 26:24.152
who's on a tight budget.

26:24.154 --> 26:27.589
90 bucks a pop, that would sink
her for the entire month.

26:29.058 --> 26:31.526
Officer Roosevelt.

26:31.528 --> 26:33.829
Yes, sir.

26:33.831 --> 26:35.497
Would you personally
profit in any way?

26:35.499 --> 26:38.433
Say, accept a fat
tip in exchange?

26:38.435 --> 26:40.902
No, sir.

26:42.405 --> 26:44.740
I believe you.

26:44.742 --> 26:46.374
I believe both of you,

26:46.376 --> 26:51.046
but, see, there is
no way to prove

26:51.048 --> 26:53.448
that there wasn't
a quid pro quo.

26:53.450 --> 26:55.383
And appearances matter.

26:56.853 --> 27:01.523
When I started on the job,

27:01.525 --> 27:03.291
all our meals were on the arm.

27:03.293 --> 27:06.561
I never paid for food or drink,

27:06.563 --> 27:08.830
and come Christmastime I had
enough gift bottles of booze

27:08.832 --> 27:10.899
to start my own saloon.

27:10.901 --> 27:12.234
(officers chuckle)

27:12.236 --> 27:14.269
It was a perk.

27:14.271 --> 27:16.438
Of a job that doesn't have many.

27:18.040 --> 27:20.041
Like pulling summonses.

27:21.577 --> 27:25.147
But the bosses put an end to it.

27:25.149 --> 27:28.517
"Appearances," they said.

27:28.519 --> 27:32.988
And on a rookie salary,
with mouths to feed,

27:32.990 --> 27:35.690
I can tell you that it hurt.

27:35.692 --> 27:39.461
But... they were right.

27:39.463 --> 27:41.296
But this isn't that.

27:41.298 --> 27:42.564
The patrol guide clearly states

27:42.566 --> 27:45.233
that you cannot accept
free goods and services

27:45.235 --> 27:47.269
'cause you're on the job.

27:47.271 --> 27:49.137
Or squash tickets either.

27:53.042 --> 27:57.112
Now... I am going
to straighten this out

27:57.114 --> 27:59.748
with the acting DA,

27:59.750 --> 28:03.018
and you are going to make
your court appearances or else.

28:03.020 --> 28:07.455
In the meantime, if you're
going to summons a judge

28:07.457 --> 28:10.125
or get an ADA's car booted

28:10.127 --> 28:13.728
or breathalyze a clerk...

28:13.730 --> 28:17.265
just make damn sure
you can show cause.

28:23.539 --> 28:25.807
There's pretty much
nothing I don't know.

28:29.846 --> 28:32.180
Ten-hut!

28:44.527 --> 28:46.127
Reagan, like the president.

28:46.129 --> 28:47.829
We just want
to talk to him.

28:47.831 --> 28:49.831
Please tell him to give me a
call as soon as he gets this.

28:49.833 --> 28:51.032
Thank you.

28:51.034 --> 28:52.968
Venezuela? Since when?

28:52.970 --> 28:55.270
Okay, thanks.

28:55.272 --> 28:57.172
I'm 0 for 8, how about you?

28:57.174 --> 28:58.473
Nada.

28:58.475 --> 29:00.508
Seems Mr. Cairo's got
a long list of acquaintances

29:00.510 --> 29:01.810
and none of 'em local.

29:01.812 --> 29:03.812
Right.
You know, I've got a confession to make.

29:03.814 --> 29:07.249
I've never seen <i>Bullitt.</i>

29:08.718 --> 29:10.218
You've never seen <i>Bullitt?</i>

29:10.220 --> 29:11.553
Yeah, I just said that.

29:11.555 --> 29:13.488
So tell me what the big deal is.

29:13.490 --> 29:15.156
'Cause from where I'm sitting,

29:15.158 --> 29:18.827
everybody's in a tizzy over some
used car from an old movie.

29:18.829 --> 29:20.095
Whoa, whoa.

29:20.097 --> 29:22.497
A car that was in the greatest
car chase ever filmed

29:22.499 --> 29:24.566
with the coolest
movie star ever.

29:24.568 --> 29:27.335
Yeah, okay, but still.

29:27.337 --> 29:29.337
You've seen <i>The Wizard of Oz?</i>

29:29.339 --> 29:31.206
Yeah, of course.

29:31.208 --> 29:32.874
Okay, well, it's Dorothy's
ruby red slippers.

29:32.876 --> 29:34.709
It's Neil Armstrong's
space suit.

29:34.711 --> 29:37.279
It's Bruce Springsteen's
Fender Esquire

29:37.281 --> 29:38.914
on the cover of <i>Born to Run.</i>

29:38.916 --> 29:41.616
It's a thing
that you could touch

29:41.618 --> 29:44.686
that stands for a whole feeling
that you had about things,

29:44.688 --> 29:47.522
what was cool and inspired you.

29:50.159 --> 29:52.761
I mean, that's a lot
to put on an old Ford.

29:54.964 --> 29:59.034
Look, you either get it
or you don't.

29:59.036 --> 30:01.202
Back to work.

30:08.010 --> 30:10.412
ALL: ♪ Happy birthday... ♪
Stop.

30:10.414 --> 30:12.080
Stop.

30:12.082 --> 30:13.715
Stop.
What?

30:13.717 --> 30:14.849
You can't sing that.

30:14.851 --> 30:15.951
Pop.

30:15.953 --> 30:17.085
Why?

30:17.087 --> 30:19.254
We can't sing "Happy
Birthday" to Aunt Erin?

30:19.256 --> 30:20.889
No, not unless you want
to pay the company

30:20.891 --> 30:22.223
that owns the rights.

30:22.225 --> 30:23.291
I read about that.

30:23.293 --> 30:24.392
I thought they
settled that.

30:24.394 --> 30:26.161
Not yet.

30:26.163 --> 30:29.197
The lawyers for the publishing
company are making an appeal.

30:29.199 --> 30:30.899
They're still fighting
over this ridiculous non-issue,

30:30.901 --> 30:32.300
as lawyers do.

30:32.302 --> 30:34.769
I'm a little lost here.

30:34.771 --> 30:36.004
Well, long story short,

30:36.006 --> 30:38.273
according to the intellectual
property statutes,

30:38.275 --> 30:40.408
you couldn't sing
the "Happy Birthday" song

30:40.410 --> 30:41.743
unless you paid a royalty

30:41.745 --> 30:43.845
to the company that
owned the copyright,

30:43.847 --> 30:45.580
or you were breaking the law.

30:46.549 --> 30:48.683
Pretty silly, don't you think?

30:48.685 --> 30:51.019
Nice, both of
you, very sweet.

30:51.021 --> 30:52.354
Okay, but people
have been singing

30:52.356 --> 30:53.855
"Happy Birthday"
forever for free.

30:53.857 --> 30:56.891
Their point being-- is that the
cops had been pulling tickets

30:56.893 --> 31:00.929
forever as a courtesy for free,
and now they can't.

31:00.931 --> 31:01.888
Ah.

31:01.912 --> 31:04.175
Because of an overreaching
district attorney's office.

31:04.634 --> 31:06.835
With a bunch of schoolmarms
and hall monitors

31:06.837 --> 31:08.336
running the joint,
apparently.

31:08.338 --> 31:09.938
Down the street
from a police department

31:09.940 --> 31:12.207
who thinks they're
above the law, apparently.

31:12.209 --> 31:13.541
Hey, let's keep it civil.

31:13.543 --> 31:14.743
You started this.

31:14.745 --> 31:16.111
He did.

31:16.113 --> 31:17.178
You both did.

31:17.180 --> 31:18.947
Can we please
change the subject?

31:18.949 --> 31:20.615
(man clears throat)

31:21.951 --> 31:25.286
Uh, yes, you're right, Nicky.

31:25.288 --> 31:26.588
Uh, we should take a moment

31:26.590 --> 31:28.490
to celebrate
your mother's birthday.

31:28.492 --> 31:30.759
Thank you.

31:32.094 --> 31:34.162
I should blow out these candles
before I burn down this cake.

31:34.164 --> 31:35.964
Don't forget
to make a wish.

31:35.966 --> 31:39.801
I think I'm a little old
for that, but... here we go.

31:40.970 --> 31:43.038
ALL:
Yay.

31:44.573 --> 31:46.941
I remember your 17th, do you?

31:46.943 --> 31:48.243
Remind me.

31:48.245 --> 31:51.913
You and Karen Schultz
and Betsy Hamilton

31:51.915 --> 31:54.249
had a little beach
party down at Rockaway.

31:54.251 --> 31:56.351
Right.
And on the way back,

31:56.353 --> 31:59.587
uh, they got stopped for
speeding on the Belt.

32:00.623 --> 32:02.257
Okay, Dad.

32:02.259 --> 32:03.925
And one of the
boys in the back,

32:03.927 --> 32:06.594
a star running back of the
football team, as I remember...

32:06.596 --> 32:07.629
Mm-hmm, Jim Sperling.

32:07.631 --> 32:08.930
That's it.

32:08.932 --> 32:11.066
Well, he had an
open can of beer

32:11.068 --> 32:12.834
and a half case
more on the floor.

32:12.836 --> 32:15.770
And he was gonna get kicked
off the football team.

32:15.772 --> 32:17.405
It's not really a good story,
Dad, so let's just...

32:17.407 --> 32:21.276
Yeah, well, your mother
had the officer call me.

32:21.278 --> 32:23.611
And I had the
summons squashed.

32:23.613 --> 32:28.349
And that, boys and girls, is
what we call the good old days.

32:28.351 --> 32:29.617
(others affirm)

32:29.619 --> 32:31.719
JAMIE:
Good old days.

32:39.795 --> 32:41.696
I know something's wrong.

32:41.698 --> 32:44.466
He never misses watching
<i>60 Minutes</i> with me.

32:44.468 --> 32:46.334
Owen said if I watch <i>60 Minutes</i>

32:46.336 --> 32:48.403
and read <i>The Economist</i>
cover-to-cover every week,

32:48.405 --> 32:50.438
it's like a vaccine against
all the crap that's out there,

32:50.440 --> 32:52.373
and we watch it together
every Sunday.

32:52.375 --> 32:54.242
Why don't you just slow...?

32:54.244 --> 32:55.910
Plus his mother hasn't
heard from him.

32:55.912 --> 32:57.946
So she called me, and I told her
about the car gone missing,

32:57.948 --> 32:59.681
and she about had a stroke.

33:01.517 --> 33:02.684
Mrs. Cairo.

33:02.686 --> 33:05.086
She says that Owen's
almost broke.

33:05.088 --> 33:06.588
She controls his trust,

33:06.590 --> 33:08.156
and she said if he
tries to sell the car,

33:08.158 --> 33:09.457
he could get himself killed.

33:09.459 --> 33:12.560
How could selling a car
get someone killed?

33:12.562 --> 33:13.828
She wouldn't tell me.

33:13.830 --> 33:16.364
Says I'm not family
and I never will be.

33:16.366 --> 33:18.333
That stupid bitch.

33:18.335 --> 33:21.035
Okay. Does she have a name?

33:21.037 --> 33:22.604
Cloris.

33:22.606 --> 33:25.373
Okay, does Cloris have
a number, an address?

33:25.375 --> 33:26.941
Yeah, of course.

33:26.943 --> 33:28.376
Got a pen?

33:28.378 --> 33:31.012
(phone ringing)
Yeah.

33:31.014 --> 33:32.347
Detective Baez.

33:35.351 --> 33:36.818
When did it come in?

33:36.820 --> 33:38.286
Okay.

33:38.288 --> 33:39.554
Thanks.

33:41.023 --> 33:43.458
That was one of the car
transporters I canvassed.

33:43.460 --> 33:45.393
Mm-hmm.
About an hour ago,

33:45.395 --> 33:48.596
they got a rush order
pickup for a '68 Ford,

33:48.598 --> 33:49.864
going from Jones Beach

33:49.866 --> 33:51.599
to a dock in Baltimore.

33:51.601 --> 33:53.801
Okay.

33:57.806 --> 33:59.307
Detective Reagan...

33:59.309 --> 34:02.210
please...

34:02.212 --> 34:04.579
don't let anything
happen to him.

34:17.186 --> 34:19.353
(siren wailing)

34:20.422 --> 34:23.491
Cloris, this is Detective Reagan
with the NYPD.

34:23.493 --> 34:24.891
I'm gonna ask you
some questions,

34:24.893 --> 34:28.262
I need you to answer them
completely and honestly, okay?

34:28.264 --> 34:31.098
Ma'am... ma'am,
with all due respect,

34:31.100 --> 34:32.333
I'm trying to save your son.

34:32.335 --> 34:33.601
So would you do me a favor

34:33.603 --> 34:35.937
and just answer
the damn questions?

34:39.274 --> 34:41.609
♪ ♪
(tires screeching)

34:42.610 --> 34:43.911
Bingo.

34:43.913 --> 34:45.446
We're in the right spot.

34:49.885 --> 34:52.786
"Horseless Carriage."

34:54.755 --> 34:57.425
(tires squeal)
Police! Hey!

34:57.427 --> 35:00.895
Keep the truck in park and stay
in the cab, you understand me?

35:00.897 --> 35:03.264
Yeah, Detective,
but you better get in line.

35:03.266 --> 35:04.465
What?!

35:05.767 --> 35:08.069
Son of a bitch.

35:09.171 --> 35:11.138
(tires screech)

35:11.140 --> 35:13.341
Take him around the front.
Yeah.

35:14.243 --> 35:15.509
Keep your hands on the wheel!

35:18.080 --> 35:19.480
Hey, get out of the car.

35:19.482 --> 35:20.681
Come on! Get out!

35:21.617 --> 35:22.817
Get over there.

35:27.322 --> 35:29.423
Good evening, Detective Baez.

35:29.425 --> 35:30.625
You know this guy?

35:30.627 --> 35:33.194
Yeah, he's a fence
for rare cars.

35:33.196 --> 35:34.629
Now that hurts.

35:34.631 --> 35:37.131
I can arrest you
for hindering prosecution!

35:37.133 --> 35:38.699
GUTTMAN:
On the contrary!

35:38.701 --> 35:39.834
How do you think
the transporters got

35:39.836 --> 35:41.002
your cell number
to call you?

35:41.004 --> 35:42.503
Did you give them your card?

35:43.438 --> 35:44.538
No.

35:44.540 --> 35:45.973
But you did give it to me.

35:45.975 --> 35:47.475
I had your card.

35:48.844 --> 35:50.544
I told them how
to get ahold of you.

35:51.713 --> 35:53.014
I'm not a fence.

35:53.016 --> 35:54.782
I'm a legitimate businessman.

35:54.784 --> 35:57.985
I represent a party willing
to go as high as $6 million

35:57.987 --> 36:01.222
for the clean title
of the <i>Bullitt</i> Mustang.

36:01.224 --> 36:02.957
Great.
That's a nice touch

36:02.959 --> 36:05.559
with the '68 Charger here.

36:05.561 --> 36:07.161
It's the other car in
the <i>Bullitt</i> chase scene.

36:07.163 --> 36:09.196
I'm glad you appreciate it.

36:09.198 --> 36:10.464
(engine revving in distance)

36:10.466 --> 36:11.866
I do.

36:11.868 --> 36:14.602
(engine rumbling)

36:14.604 --> 36:15.903
Hey, Danny, is that it?

36:15.905 --> 36:18.039
Get over there.

36:20.909 --> 36:22.410
(engine rumbling)

36:22.412 --> 36:24.679
That's it.
That's it.

36:24.681 --> 36:25.613
I said stay over there.

36:25.615 --> 36:26.647
Get, you know,
get in the car.

36:26.649 --> 36:28.616
Come on!
Get your ass in there!

36:28.618 --> 36:31.052
Stay there.
Staying in.

36:46.702 --> 36:49.236
(engine turns off)

36:52.674 --> 36:53.941
I'm Owen Cairo.

36:53.943 --> 36:56.177
I believe you're expecting me?

36:56.179 --> 36:57.278
No...

36:57.280 --> 36:59.380
I'm afraid we were, Mr. Cairo.

36:59.382 --> 37:00.981
You're under arrest

37:00.983 --> 37:04.518
for insurance fraud and
falsely reporting an incident.

37:04.520 --> 37:05.786
This is my car.

37:05.788 --> 37:06.887
I know that.

37:06.889 --> 37:08.155
But you got greedy.

37:08.157 --> 37:09.657
You had it stolen

37:09.659 --> 37:11.959
so you could double-dip
and collect the insurance.

37:11.961 --> 37:14.895
So, it may be your car,
but now your ass is mine.

37:14.897 --> 37:15.930
CAIRO:
We can settle this.

37:15.932 --> 37:18.199
Let me just
get the car on its way...

37:18.201 --> 37:19.633
No can do.

37:19.635 --> 37:21.302
I own it.
Yeah.

37:21.304 --> 37:22.536
The title, free and clear.

37:22.538 --> 37:24.472
I... I have the right
to sell it.

37:24.474 --> 37:25.706
Yeah, but then we'd have to add

37:25.708 --> 37:27.808
felony, fraud and
misrepresentation

37:27.810 --> 37:28.876
to your list of charges.

37:28.878 --> 37:30.644
Or you could face
an early grave,

37:30.646 --> 37:32.713
depending on who the buyer is.

37:32.715 --> 37:35.282
What are you talking about?

37:36.518 --> 37:38.753
That's not the <i>Bullitt</i> Mustang.

37:40.055 --> 37:42.690
It's just a green '68.

37:42.692 --> 37:45.459
No.

37:46.762 --> 37:48.262
Yeah.

37:49.164 --> 37:51.565
Yeah, you can check
the VIN number.

37:51.567 --> 37:54.568
It's over there on the...
passenger side dashboard.

37:54.570 --> 37:56.170
Right over there, you see?
Go ahead!

37:56.172 --> 37:57.905
Check it.

37:57.907 --> 38:00.141
Mr. Cairo, this car
was manufactured

38:00.143 --> 38:02.042
six months
after the <i>Bullitt</i> car.

38:02.044 --> 38:03.444
My father bought
the <i>Bullitt</i> car from...

38:03.446 --> 38:04.779
Yes, he did.

38:04.781 --> 38:06.781
And then he bought
this one a week later

38:06.783 --> 38:08.983
from a used car
lot in Garden City

38:08.985 --> 38:13.354
as a dummy car for insurance in
case somebody got a crazy idea

38:13.356 --> 38:15.723
to pull a stunt like
you're doing right now.

38:15.725 --> 38:18.459
Where's the other car?

38:18.461 --> 38:21.629
I'm afraid only your
mother knows that.

38:25.367 --> 38:27.868
Damn them.

38:32.774 --> 38:35.443
Damn them to hell.

38:35.445 --> 38:36.710
Hands behind
your back.

38:36.712 --> 38:38.412
DANNY: If it's any
consolation, Mr. Cairo,

38:38.414 --> 38:42.049
and I hope it is, your
wife truly loves you.

38:42.918 --> 38:45.352
(sobs quietly)

38:47.389 --> 38:50.124
You drive him,
I'll drive the evidence.

38:50.126 --> 38:53.294
Oh, sure, okay.

39:09.377 --> 39:11.445
(knocks on door)

39:11.447 --> 39:13.881
I have ADA Reagan.

39:15.183 --> 39:17.084
Sent your detail to my office.

39:17.086 --> 39:19.386
Looked like I was
being arrested.

39:19.388 --> 39:21.889
And how'd that feel?

39:21.891 --> 39:23.591
Not funny.

39:25.060 --> 39:27.995
I need a few minutes
of your time.

39:29.564 --> 39:31.499
Please?

39:37.205 --> 39:40.241
Well, maybe more
than a few minutes,

39:40.243 --> 39:41.876
depending on how this goes.

39:41.878 --> 39:43.410
For what?

39:43.412 --> 39:45.713
For you and me to go over these

39:45.715 --> 39:48.315
and come up with a compromise,

39:48.317 --> 39:51.318
uh, regarding my officers
and your charges against them

39:51.320 --> 39:54.021
that we can take to your boss
and get him to sign off on.

39:54.023 --> 39:56.524
This isn't something
you and I should be doing.

39:56.526 --> 39:58.392
I think it is.

39:58.394 --> 40:01.061
We don't run the district
attorney's office-- me or you.

40:01.063 --> 40:05.432
No, but we do run
a family business.

40:08.770 --> 40:11.739
And the moment you chose
to pick up that microphone

40:11.741 --> 40:14.775
and call out my officers--
and you had the right,

40:14.777 --> 40:18.412
the responsibility even,
I'll give you that--

40:18.414 --> 40:23.317
but you made a choice that
impacted the family business.

40:26.187 --> 40:28.989
And what always comes first?

40:30.659 --> 40:32.826
Family.

40:48.009 --> 40:50.678
Okay.

40:50.680 --> 40:52.880
Let's get to work.

40:57.052 --> 40:59.219
Officer Keith Roosevelt.

41:10.599 --> 41:11.765
Francis X.

41:11.767 --> 41:12.933
Frank.

41:12.935 --> 41:15.436
I have to go by the name
on the license.

41:15.438 --> 41:17.471
Don't make trouble.

41:17.473 --> 41:19.006
How'd you swing this?

41:19.008 --> 41:20.708
Told his mother
I'd do what I could

41:20.710 --> 41:22.476
during my testimony at trial.

41:22.478 --> 41:23.477
Name?

41:23.479 --> 41:25.012
Francis X.

41:25.014 --> 41:27.381
Do what you could?

41:27.383 --> 41:29.083
Well, nothing untoward.

41:29.085 --> 41:32.052
You know, no priors,
pillar of the community.

41:32.054 --> 41:33.120
That type of junk.

41:33.122 --> 41:34.722
Right this way, please.

41:35.857 --> 41:37.224
(whispering):
All right.

41:37.226 --> 41:38.726
(claps once)

41:45.667 --> 41:48.469
Enjoy.

41:53.675 --> 41:57.378
(theme music from <i>Bullitt</i> plays)

42:05.186 --> 42:06.854
(chuckles)

42:06.856 --> 42:09.857
I'm impressed.

42:09.859 --> 42:11.859
I got the chills.

42:11.861 --> 42:13.394
You got the chills?

42:13.396 --> 42:14.762
Damn.

42:14.764 --> 42:16.196
What?

42:16.198 --> 42:18.732
I don't know, just damn.

42:18.734 --> 42:21.168
Yeah, damn.

42:21.170 --> 42:23.737
Wow, look at
it, Gramps.

42:28.143 --> 42:29.677
HENRY:
The real deal.

42:34.582 --> 42:36.950
Wow.

42:36.952 --> 42:38.952
Hey, will you, um,

42:38.954 --> 42:40.587
take a picture of us?

42:40.589 --> 42:41.488
With the car?

42:41.490 --> 42:43.090
Hey, let's
take a picture.

42:51.700 --> 42:53.734
Best Christmas
card photo ever.

42:53.736 --> 42:54.968
(chuckles)

42:56.741 --> 42:57.941
