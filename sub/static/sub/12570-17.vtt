00:03.667 --> 00:05.459
- I hope Jessie's
- audition went well.

00:05.500 --> 00:07.621
- Does anyone know - what it was for?
- (DOOR CLOSING)

00:11.042 --> 00:12.626
- I just had
- the worst day ever.

00:13.292 --> 00:14.792
- Well, mine just
- got better.

00:14.834 --> 00:16.626
(LAUGHING)

00:16.667 --> 00:18.355
Okay, so I thought

00:18.356 --> 00:20.042
I was auditioning

00:16.667 --> 00:20.042
for a local TV commercial.

00:20.083 --> 00:21.188
Then, suddenly they

00:21.189 --> 00:22.292
zip me into this get-up,

00:22.334 --> 00:24.310
- and I'm standing on - the street,
trying to - Get people to eat at

00:24.334 --> 00:26.042
- "Dan's Diggity
- Dog Delight!"

00:26.083 --> 00:28.844
- Which, by the way, - smells worse than
- The inside of this costume.

00:29.083 --> 00:30.188
Seriously, who wore this

00:30.189 --> 00:31.292
before me, Big Foot?

00:32.083 --> 00:34.751
ALL: Oh! Whoa!

00:35.459 --> 00:36.459
Why didn't you just

00:36.460 --> 00:37.460
take the suit off?

00:37.500 --> 00:38.605
Although that mustard

00:38.606 --> 00:39.709
brings out your eyes.

00:40.542 --> 00:42.042
- Because the zipper
- got stuck.

00:42.083 --> 00:43.852
- And then the bus driver
- said he wouldn't let me on

00:43.876 --> 00:45.542
- Because food
- is not allowed.

00:47.083 --> 00:48.459
It is New York,

00:48.460 --> 00:49.834
I am sure no one noticed.

00:49.876 --> 00:51.459
Oh, yeah?

00:51.500 --> 00:52.772
I was chased for

00:52.773 --> 00:54.042
20 blocks by hungry dogs

00:51.500 --> 00:54.042
and angry vegans.

00:54.083 --> 00:55.626
- Considering they
- don't eat meat,

00:55.667 --> 00:58.108
- Those lentil lovers - have a surprising
- Amount of stamina.

00:59.334 --> 01:00.688
Well, I'm just glad

01:00.689 --> 01:02.042
you finally got...

do something to take

my career to the next level.

me my theme.

It's "Love."

- Oh, this is perfect!
- I know all about love.

So, what do you guys

03:06.981 --> 03:08.083
think of my script?

03:05.876 --> 03:08.083
Be honest.

03:08.125 --> 03:10.083
- Unless you hated it,
- then be quiet.

03:11.083 --> 03:12.083
It is riveting,

Madame Tarantino.

I don't know who

03:15.523 --> 03:17.042
this Zuni character is,

03:17.083 --> 03:19.042
- but I find the scene
- where she happily

03:19.083 --> 03:20.542
Finishes her homework

03:20.543 --> 03:22.000
totally unbelievable.

03:23.083 --> 03:25.042
- Am I to assume I will
- play the role of Duke,

03:25.083 --> 03:27.000
- The suave
- ladies' man?

03:28.626 --> 03:29.730
I'm pretty sure

03:29.731 --> 03:30.834
that's me, dude.

03:31.083 --> 03:32.334
But the only other

03:32.335 --> 03:33.584
boy role is Tavi,

03:33.626 --> 03:35.126
the pathetic wretch

03:35.127 --> 03:36.626
whose only friend

03:33.626 --> 03:36.626
is a wizard.

- to say, "Lizard."

Oh! Oh...

03:42.834 --> 03:43.939
Zuri, you are also in

03:43.940 --> 03:45.042
charge of set design.

03:45.083 --> 03:46.792
- Great, what's
- my budget?

03:46.834 --> 03:47.876
Nothing.

03:47.918 --> 03:49.459
- Then that's what
- you're getting.

03:50.083 --> 03:51.226
- Bertram, you are
- craft services.

Ooh, what's that?

03:52.626 --> 03:53.918
- It means you
- feed the crew.

- Oh, so basically
- what I always do.

03:55.959 --> 03:57.480

03:57.481 --> 03:59.000
in your glamorous world

03:55.959 --> 03:59.000

- we only have

04:02.083 --> 04:04.042
- 13 hours to get this
- movie in the can.

04:04.083 --> 04:05.083
I better go get Tony a

04:05.084 --> 04:06.084
copy of the script.

04:06.125 --> 04:07.584
Do you really think

04:07.585 --> 04:09.042
Tony wants to re-create

04:09.083 --> 04:11.042
- how you met
- and fell in love?

04:11.083 --> 04:12.563
Even though you dumped him

04:12.564 --> 04:14.042
and stomped on his heart?

04:14.083 --> 04:16.041
- Not that I'm
- taking sides.

04:17.083 --> 04:18.563
The breakup was mutual,

04:18.564 --> 04:20.041
but maybe you're right.

04:20.083 --> 04:21.563
It might be kind of

04:21.564 --> 04:23.042
awkward to act out our

04:20.083 --> 04:23.042
relationship on camera.

04:23.083 --> 04:24.480
It was awkward enough

04:24.481 --> 04:25.876
for those of us who had

04:23.083 --> 04:25.876
to watch it in real life.

04:27.083 --> 04:28.959
- So, who is going
- to play "Toby,"

04:31.834 --> 04:34.584

04:35.792 --> 04:37.000
- And you can
- keep him.

04:39.083 --> 04:40.876
- Why don't you hire
- Nicolas Cage?

04:40.918 --> 04:42.000
He'll do anything.

04:42.918 --> 04:44.584
- I can't afford
- Nicolas Cage!

04:44.626 --> 04:45.730
Can't even afford

04:45.731 --> 04:46.834
to download

04:44.626 --> 04:46.834
one of his movies.

04:46.876 --> 04:48.727
- And I don't have - the time to sit
- And audition

04:48.751 --> 04:49.876
Tons of young,

04:49.877 --> 04:51.000

- Including,
- now, myself.

05:10.083 --> 05:12.042
- I'm making a movie
- about our relationship.

05:12.083 --> 05:13.126
And these guys are

05:13.127 --> 05:14.167
auditioning to play you.

05:14.209 --> 05:15.375
Oh.

05:15.417 --> 05:17.143
- But why didn't you just
- ask me to play me?

05:17.167 --> 05:18.522
I mean, I saw that

05:18.523 --> 05:19.876
movie where Lincoln

05:17.167 --> 05:19.876
played himself.

05:20.292 --> 05:21.668
That wasn't Lincoln.

05:21.669 --> 05:23.042
It was...

05:20.292 --> 05:23.042
Don't bother.

05:23.083 --> 05:24.563
I spent two hours trying

05:24.564 --> 05:26.042
to explain to him

05:23.083 --> 05:26.042
that E.T. was a puppet.

05:26.334 --> 05:28.000
He rode a bicycle!

05:29.876 --> 05:31.522
Okay, well, if you're

05:31.523 --> 05:33.167
okay with it, I'd love

05:29.876 --> 05:33.167
to have you play you.

05:34.565 --> 05:35.918
a great me.

(CHUCKLES)

05:35.959 --> 05:37.543
Oh, Jessie, I just

05:37.544 --> 05:39.125
thought of a way to make

05:35.959 --> 05:39.125
your script better.

05:39.167 --> 05:41.000
Maybe even good!

05:42.083 --> 05:44.000
- Your love story
- needs a twist.

05:45.918 --> 05:47.043
I don't care that

05:47.044 --> 05:48.167
our two kinds are

05:45.918 --> 05:48.167
forbidden to love,

05:48.959 --> 05:50.042
- we belong
- together!

05:55.125 --> 05:57.059
- That's actually pain.
- You're standing on my paw.

Oh, sorry.

- I know,
- and they're lovely,

a slight flea problem.

Aw, wolfman!

06:11.209 --> 06:12.584

06:12.585 --> 06:13.959
supposed to be good

06:11.209 --> 06:13.959
for three months!

Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi!

with teeth marks?

06:19.334 --> 06:20.647

like this...

- I haven't seen - you at any of
- The pack meetings.

06:25.083 --> 06:26.042
- What kind of
- werewolf are you?

06:26.083 --> 06:27.792
- I'm a were-poodle!
- (CHUCKLING)

06:28.083 --> 06:29.083
- You're not
- very scary.

06:29.125 --> 06:30.834
But I'm adorable!

06:30.876 --> 06:32.000
And hypoallergenic.

06:32.751 --> 06:33.772
You have a little

06:33.773 --> 06:34.792
human in your fangs.

06:35.083 --> 06:36.918
- (CAT MEWING)
- Ooh, cat! (CHUCKLES)

06:38.459 --> 06:39.563
Where's a silver bullet

06:39.564 --> 06:40.667
when you need one?

06:42.334 --> 06:44.083
- Okay, even if
- I wanted to do that,

06:44.125 --> 06:45.709
Which I don't,

06:45.751 --> 06:47.314
where would I find

06:47.315 --> 06:48.876
a werewolf costume

06:45.751 --> 06:48.876
on such short notice?

06:48.918 --> 06:50.226
- Easy, just shave
- Bertram's back

06:50.250 --> 06:51.751
- And glue it
- all over Tony.

06:53.626 --> 06:54.668
Okay, I can't tell you

06:54.669 --> 06:55.709
how many different ways

06:53.626 --> 06:55.709
that makes me nauseous.

06:58.417 --> 07:00.250
Okay people,

07:00.251 --> 07:02.083
we only have 10 hours

06:58.417 --> 07:02.083
to finish this film.

07:02.125 --> 07:04.059
- We need to shoot - the scene where
- "Chantal" meets "Toby."

07:04.083 --> 07:05.083
Hey, who's this

07:05.084 --> 07:06.084
"Toby" guy?

07:06.125 --> 07:07.584
You! Seriously,

07:07.585 --> 07:09.042
you have the memory

07:06.125 --> 07:09.042
of a goldfish.

07:11.042 --> 07:12.542
So I am "Tavi,"

07:12.543 --> 07:14.042
and Luke is "Duke."

07:14.083 --> 07:16.000
- How do you get
- "Chantal" from Jessie?

07:16.209 --> 07:17.751
- I just always
- liked that name.

07:18.250 --> 07:19.792
Where's Zuri?

07:21.083 --> 07:22.188
I'm sorry,

07:22.189 --> 07:23.292
but it took me forever

07:21.083 --> 07:23.292
to get her to wear this.

07:23.334 --> 07:24.688
I don't wear

07:24.689 --> 07:26.042
tutus anymore.

07:26.083 --> 07:27.417
What am I, a kid?

07:28.292 --> 07:30.042
- She bites harder
- than Mrs. Kipling.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.563
And at least Mrs. K

07:31.564 --> 07:33.042
apologizes by leaving

07:30.083 --> 07:33.042
a rat at your door.

07:35.083 --> 07:36.126
Zuri, this is how

07:36.127 --> 07:37.167
you were dressed

07:35.083 --> 07:37.167
when we met.

07:37.209 --> 07:38.543
Now get in position

07:38.544 --> 07:39.876
and no more biting.

07:40.209 --> 07:41.209
Okay, can we finally

07:41.210 --> 07:42.210
get the first shot!

07:42.250 --> 07:44.042
- Craft services is
- here with lunch!

07:44.083 --> 07:46.125
- No, Bertram, no,
- we don't have time to eat!

07:46.167 --> 07:47.543
But I worked so hard.

07:47.544 --> 07:48.918
I even chopped stuff.

07:49.125 --> 07:50.918
Okay, fine!

07:52.083 --> 07:53.042
- (MUFFLED VOICE)
- Happy now?

07:53.083 --> 07:54.435
- There were
- toothpicks in those.

07:54.459 --> 07:56.042
(GAGGING)

07:58.250 --> 07:59.500
Okay.

07:59.542 --> 08:01.226
- Do you know - what you have to do?
- Of course.

08:01.250 --> 08:03.042
- When you fall - to the ground
- I say,

08:03.083 --> 08:04.834
- "Aw, man. - Are you okay?"
- Mmm-hmm.

08:04.876 --> 08:06.268
- Then help you up,
- like when we first met.

08:06.292 --> 08:07.376
Great. And since

08:07.377 --> 08:08.459
I can't afford a cab,

08:08.500 --> 08:10.125
- I'm just going to
- run and fall.

08:10.167 --> 08:11.189
Okay,

08:11.190 --> 08:12.209
let's do this!

08:12.250 --> 08:13.334
Action!

08:14.083 --> 08:15.167
Whoa!

08:15.209 --> 08:16.459
Aw...

08:16.500 --> 08:18.292
- What's my
- line again?

08:18.334 --> 08:20.000
"Aw, man!"

08:22.083 --> 08:23.563
Ten bucks says the battery

08:23.564 --> 08:25.042
in the camera dies

08:22.083 --> 08:25.042
before we get this.

08:25.083 --> 08:26.292
(BOTH LAUGHING)

08:26.334 --> 08:27.876
Okay, Tony,

08:27.918 --> 08:29.042
- let's try
- this again.

08:29.584 --> 08:30.918
Action!

08:31.417 --> 08:32.918
Whoa!

08:32.958 --> 08:34.125
Aw, Mom!

08:35.082 --> 08:37.000
Aw, man!

08:37.042 --> 08:39.042
- Sorry, Jessie... Chantal...
- Whoever you are.

08:41.292 --> 08:43.125
- Okay, let's
- try 'er again.

08:44.959 --> 08:46.209
- Action!
- Whoa!

08:49.083 --> 08:50.167
Really?

08:50.168 --> 08:51.250
Hey, I'm still

08:49.083 --> 08:51.250
on the clock!

08:52.209 --> 08:53.584
Jessie, I've

08:53.585 --> 08:54.959
been thinking.

08:56.125 --> 08:57.604
What this movie needs

08:57.605 --> 08:59.083
is some real action,

08:59.125 --> 09:00.355
and a new leading man.

09:00.356 --> 09:01.584
(CHUCKLES)

09:03.459 --> 09:05.167
- Thank you so much
- for rescuing me

09:05.209 --> 09:06.230
From Dr. Dastardly's

09:06.231 --> 09:07.250
volcano lair.

09:07.292 --> 09:09.209
- You saved me
- just in time.

09:09.500 --> 09:10.834
I know,

09:11.083 --> 09:13.000
- your toes are
- still smoking.

09:15.626 --> 09:17.250
- And the rest
- of you, too.

09:18.417 --> 09:19.855
Why, thank you.

09:19.856 --> 09:21.292
But I don't even

09:18.417 --> 09:21.292
know your name.

09:21.584 --> 09:23.000
Ross.

09:23.250 --> 09:24.250
Luke Ross.

09:25.083 --> 09:26.125
And you are?

09:26.167 --> 09:27.189
Dimples.

09:27.190 --> 09:28.209
Dimples Galore.

09:29.209 --> 09:31.000
(TIRES SCREECHING)

09:31.042 --> 09:32.059
- How are we going to
- get away from those

09:32.083 --> 09:33.959
- Evil spies who want to
- blow up the world,

09:34.000 --> 09:35.226
- Even though it means
- their death as well?

09:35.250 --> 09:37.090
- Which I find to be
- kinda counter-intuitive.

09:38.209 --> 09:40.125
- I don't know what
- that word means,

09:40.167 --> 09:41.584
But you're so cute

09:41.585 --> 09:43.000
I might look it up later.

09:45.083 --> 09:46.583
Now, before I force

09:46.584 --> 09:48.083
those evil spies

09:45.083 --> 09:48.083
off that cliff

09:48.125 --> 09:49.772
with an assortment

09:49.773 --> 09:51.417
of wicked cool gadgets,

09:51.459 --> 09:52.813
how about a

09:52.814 --> 09:54.167
high-speed kiss?

09:56.626 --> 09:57.793
Wow, that is

09:57.794 --> 09:58.959
action-packed.

09:59.083 --> 10:00.230
But I would just make

10:00.231 --> 10:01.375
one small change.

10:03.209 --> 10:04.459
- Farewell,
- Mr. Ross.

10:11.083 --> 10:12.602
- Maybe I should have
- thought this through.

10:12.626 --> 10:14.042
(TIRES SCREECHING)

10:14.083 --> 10:15.125
(SCREAMING)

10:18.167 --> 10:19.959
- There is no way
- I'm doing a movie

10:20.000 --> 10:21.334
Where women wear

10:21.335 --> 10:22.667
skimpy clothes

10:20.000 --> 10:22.667
and are objectified.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.309
- Then you're going to
- hate the sequel.

10:26.083 --> 10:27.459
Okay, let's get moving!

10:27.500 --> 10:29.064
But Tony has over

10:29.065 --> 10:30.626
20 lines in this scene.

10:30.667 --> 10:32.125
- What are we
- going do?

10:32.167 --> 10:33.375
I'll shoot around him.

10:33.417 --> 10:35.178
- What does that mean?
- I'll fix it in post.

10:35.209 --> 10:36.605
Come again?

10:36.606 --> 10:38.000
Oh, just go point the camera

10:35.209 --> 10:38.000
and capture the magic!

10:41.667 --> 10:43.042
Chantal,

10:43.083 --> 10:44.542
you are amazing.

10:45.083 --> 10:46.688
Your eyes remind me

10:46.689 --> 10:48.292
of a full baboon.

10:49.083 --> 10:50.083
Cut!

10:51.209 --> 10:53.000
Again! Tony,

10:53.125 --> 10:54.813
for the tenth time,

10:54.814 --> 10:56.500
the line is,

10:53.125 --> 10:56.500
"A full moon."

10:56.542 --> 10:58.272
It's not romantic to say

10:58.273 --> 11:00.000
that my eyes remind you

10:56.542 --> 11:00.000
of a monkey's butt.

11:00.834 --> 11:02.125
Sorry, but

11:02.167 --> 11:04.059
- re-living our - relationship
- Is making me feel

11:04.083 --> 11:06.042
- Kind of
- uncomfortable.

11:06.083 --> 11:07.605
Or it could just be

11:07.606 --> 11:09.125
from eating 10 helpings

11:06.083 --> 11:09.125
of pasta fazool.

11:10.083 --> 11:12.042
- Back in a minute!
- Or an hour.

11:12.083 --> 11:13.500
- That fazool
- binds you right up.

11:15.626 --> 11:17.189
Jessie, when

11:17.190 --> 11:18.751
you said I was "in

11:15.626 --> 11:18.751
charge of the boom,"

11:18.792 --> 11:19.897
I thought I would

11:19.898 --> 11:21.000
get to blow stuff up.

11:21.375 --> 11:22.959
At least you do not have

11:22.960 --> 11:24.542
to keep peering through

11:21.375 --> 11:24.542
this camera for hours.

11:24.584 --> 11:25.834
My right eye

11:25.835 --> 11:27.083
refuses to open.

making food with

11:28.459 --> 11:32.209
"Fazool" in the name.

11:32.250 --> 11:34.209
- Great, any more
- complaints?

11:34.250 --> 11:35.272
Yes. Your movie

11:35.273 --> 11:36.292
is boring.

11:37.459 --> 11:38.855
I meant any complaints

11:38.856 --> 11:40.250
that don't make me sad?

11:40.292 --> 11:41.751
No. But I have an idea

11:41.752 --> 11:43.209
how to spice this up.

11:45.292 --> 11:46.334
Wait!

11:46.375 --> 11:48.083
No! Let me go.

12:08.189 --> 12:09.250
with a mustache.

12:09.292 --> 12:10.334
It tends to make you

12:10.335 --> 12:11.375
a little cranky!

- Well, your plan will
- never work!

12:14.167 --> 12:16.334
will save me!

- that cowpoke?

Zuri, I have to

12:28.231 --> 12:29.375
shoot a love story.

12:29.417 --> 12:30.793
There is nothing

12:30.794 --> 12:32.167
romantic about being

12:29.417 --> 12:32.167
crushed by a train.

12:32.209 --> 12:34.083
Jessie, it's a metaphor.

12:34.125 --> 12:35.709
- You're so
- one-dimensional.

12:37.083 --> 12:38.834
Jessie, I have some

12:38.835 --> 12:40.584
choices for your clothes

12:37.083 --> 12:40.584
for the next scene!

12:40.626 --> 12:42.105
I went in your closet,

12:42.106 --> 12:43.584
but then I just got

12:40.626 --> 12:43.584
dizzy and depressed,

12:43.626 --> 12:44.792
so...

12:45.167 --> 12:47.042
- So I brought you
- some of Mom's stuff.

12:47.083 --> 12:48.209
Oh, thanks, Emma,

12:48.250 --> 12:50.059
- but I want to wear - the exact outfit
- I had on

12:50.083 --> 12:51.792
- When I went on my
- first date with Tony.

12:51.834 --> 12:53.251
Okay, but no wonder

12:53.252 --> 12:54.667
your relationship

12:51.834 --> 12:54.667
didn't work out.

12:59.751 --> 13:00.814
Wait, you still

13:00.815 --> 13:01.876
need make-up!

13:01.918 --> 13:03.834
- I have to make you look
- two years younger!

13:03.876 --> 13:05.435
- FYI, you have way more
- worry-lines now

13:05.459 --> 13:07.083
- Than when you
- started working here.

13:07.417 --> 13:08.751
I can't imagine why!

13:10.000 --> 13:11.643
- Look, If I'm going to - get this
film ready - For the contest,

13:11.667 --> 13:12.939
I have to get this scene

13:12.940 --> 13:14.209
where Tony and I

13:11.667 --> 13:14.209
kiss in the teacup!

13:14.250 --> 13:15.542
Now, go get him.

13:16.167 --> 13:17.459
- Zuri, where's
- my teacup?

13:17.500 --> 13:19.000
Right here!

13:20.125 --> 13:21.292
Ta-da!

13:22.542 --> 13:24.292
- It's smaller
- than I expected.

13:24.334 --> 13:25.709
And less teacup-y.

13:25.959 --> 13:27.209
- And more
- cardboard-y.

13:28.250 --> 13:29.709
- You get what
- you pay for.

13:30.584 --> 13:32.185
- How is the audience
- supposed to believe that

13:32.209 --> 13:34.125
- Toby and Chantal
- are trapped in there?

13:34.167 --> 13:35.625
Uh, kneel down.

13:35.626 --> 13:37.083
Problem solved.

13:37.125 --> 13:38.125
I want a producer

13:38.126 --> 13:39.126
credit for that.

13:40.083 --> 13:41.125
Uh, Jessie,

13:41.167 --> 13:43.042
- we have a
- small issue.

13:43.083 --> 13:44.083
How small?

13:48.125 --> 13:49.626
- I'd say about
- three sizes.

13:49.667 --> 13:51.355
Who would have

13:51.356 --> 13:53.042
suspected a $15 tux

13:49.667 --> 13:53.042
was dry clean only.

13:53.083 --> 13:54.709
Everyone!

13:54.751 --> 13:55.772
On the bright side,

13:55.773 --> 13:56.792
at least your outfit

13:54.751 --> 13:56.792
matches the teacup.

13:57.209 --> 13:58.376
Now get in, we need

13:58.377 --> 13:59.542
to start the scene.

13:59.834 --> 14:01.667
- Ravi, is the water
- effect ready?

14:01.709 --> 14:03.250
- Why does Ravi
- get to do it?

14:03.292 --> 14:04.563
Dousing people

14:04.564 --> 14:05.834
with water is

14:03.292 --> 14:05.834
my specialty!

14:05.876 --> 14:07.334
And yet, the concept

14:07.335 --> 14:08.792
of bathing eludes you.

14:09.167 --> 14:10.334
Guys, knock it off.

14:10.335 --> 14:11.500
We need to get going!

14:12.584 --> 14:15.292
Ready, and action!

14:15.626 --> 14:17.501
I cannot believe

14:17.502 --> 14:19.375
we're trapped in this

14:15.626 --> 14:19.375
huge teacup.

14:20.167 --> 14:21.417
- (WHISPERING)
- Down! Down!

14:23.542 --> 14:24.939
Well, at least

14:24.940 --> 14:26.334
we're finally

14:23.542 --> 14:26.334
alone together, Toby.

14:26.375 --> 14:27.772
And nothing can ruin

14:27.773 --> 14:29.167
this perfect moment.

14:29.209 --> 14:30.375
(CLICKS)

14:31.500 --> 14:33.376
I said, nothing can ruin

14:33.377 --> 14:35.250
this perfect moment.

14:35.292 --> 14:36.167
(CLICKING)

14:36.209 --> 14:37.251
Ravi! Ruin this

14:37.252 --> 14:38.292
perfect moment!

14:39.250 --> 14:41.125
- It should
- be working...

14:41.500 --> 14:42.668
Never mind.

14:42.669 --> 14:43.834
Let's just skip to

14:41.500 --> 14:43.834
the kissing scene,

14:43.876 --> 14:45.292
- we're running
- out of time!

14:45.334 --> 14:47.125
- Oh, Toby...
- Um, Jessie...

14:47.167 --> 14:48.460
It's Chantal!

14:48.461 --> 14:49.751
No, I'm talking

14:47.167 --> 14:49.751
to you, Jessie.

14:50.209 --> 14:51.768
- I just don't feel
- comfortable kissing you,

14:51.792 --> 14:53.125
- Now that we're
- broken up.

14:53.167 --> 14:54.792
- It's called
- "Acting."

14:54.834 --> 14:56.042
I know it's awkward,

14:56.043 --> 14:57.250
but this movie is really

14:54.834 --> 14:57.250
important to me!

14:57.292 --> 14:59.209
- I understand,
- but I just can't!

14:59.250 --> 15:00.918
Just think back

15:00.959 --> 15:02.730
to how in love we were

15:02.731 --> 15:04.500
at this incredibly sweet,

15:00.959 --> 15:04.500
romantic moment.

15:04.542 --> 15:06.334
- Now kiss me, - you greasy
- Haired mook!

15:06.876 --> 15:08.542
(CLOTH RIPPING)

15:10.083 --> 15:11.522
I'm sorry, Jessie.

15:11.523 --> 15:12.959
You'll just have to finish

15:10.083 --> 15:12.959
your movie without me.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.375
It's just too weird!

15:14.792 --> 15:16.667
- And now that I've
- split my pants,

15:17.292 --> 15:18.500
- It's a little
- too drafty.

15:19.250 --> 15:20.293
Wait, Tony,

15:20.294 --> 15:21.334
come back!

15:21.375 --> 15:23.226
- This is the most - important scene
- In the movie!

15:23.250 --> 15:24.417
- Who am I going
- to kiss?

15:24.459 --> 15:25.751
- Me, me!
- I'll do it!

15:25.792 --> 15:27.250
(GLASS SHATTERING)

15:27.292 --> 15:29.439
Oh, now I see why

15:29.440 --> 15:31.584
they call it a "Boom."

15:27.292 --> 15:31.584
(CHUCKLING)

15:31.626 --> 15:33.542
Cut. Just cut.

15:33.918 --> 15:35.209
- Can't anything
- go right?

15:39.375 --> 15:41.334
- Well, the water effect
- is working.

15:46.334 --> 15:47.334
Jessie, we know

15:47.335 --> 15:48.335
you're upset,

15:48.375 --> 15:49.709
- but you can't just
- sit around

15:49.751 --> 15:50.959
And drown your

15:50.960 --> 15:52.167
sorrows in fro-yo.

15:52.459 --> 15:53.855
Why not? It's the only thing

15:53.856 --> 15:55.250
I've done today without

15:52.459 --> 15:55.250
messing it up.

15:56.083 --> 15:58.250
Jessie, that's not true.

15:58.292 --> 15:59.626
Thank you, Zuri.

15:59.667 --> 16:00.689
I was talking

16:00.690 --> 16:01.709
about the fro-yo.

16:01.751 --> 16:03.250
- You've got it all
- over you.

16:04.459 --> 16:05.522
Oh, man, this was

16:05.523 --> 16:06.584
a designer dress.

16:06.626 --> 16:08.334
- This is getting
- sadder and sadder.

16:09.334 --> 16:10.438
Okay, guys, I don't

16:10.439 --> 16:11.542
know if you're noticed,

16:11.584 --> 16:13.417
but my acting career

16:13.418 --> 16:15.250
hasn't exactly gone

16:11.584 --> 16:15.250
the way I thought it would.

16:15.292 --> 16:16.626
- No.
- You're kidding.

16:16.667 --> 16:17.959
I've not noticed.

16:17.960 --> 16:19.250
Your last job

16:16.667 --> 16:19.250
was as a hot dog.

16:20.417 --> 16:21.667
Love you.

16:23.292 --> 16:24.459
Hey, look,

16:25.292 --> 16:27.209
- I know I've been really
- stressed out lately,

16:27.250 --> 16:28.793
And I'm sorry if

16:28.794 --> 16:30.334
I've been a little

16:27.250 --> 16:30.334
too harsh on you.

16:30.834 --> 16:32.209
- All I ever wanted
- was to do

16:32.250 --> 16:33.602
- Something creative
- with my life,

16:33.626 --> 16:35.834
And I just...

16:35.876 --> 16:37.084
I'm afraid that

16:37.085 --> 16:38.292
this movie is

16:35.876 --> 16:38.292
my last chance.

16:38.751 --> 16:40.168
Jessie, you're

16:40.169 --> 16:41.584
an amazingly

16:38.751 --> 16:41.584
talented person.

16:42.042 --> 16:43.771
Yeah, we know

16:43.772 --> 16:45.500
you'll make it if you

16:42.042 --> 16:45.500
just keep trying.

16:45.542 --> 16:47.501
You must continue

16:47.502 --> 16:49.459
the pursuit of your

16:45.542 --> 16:49.459
cinematic aspirations.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.059
- He took the words
- right out of my mouth.

16:51.083 --> 16:53.000
- And made them
- big and confusing.

16:54.083 --> 16:55.375
Thank you, guys.

16:55.417 --> 16:56.792
I really appreciate it.

16:56.834 --> 16:58.105
But there's only an

16:58.106 --> 16:59.375
hour until the deadline.

16:59.417 --> 17:00.980
Even if I could manage

17:00.981 --> 17:02.542
to piece together a film

16:59.417 --> 17:02.542
from what we shot,

17:02.584 --> 17:04.041
- I still don't
- have an ending.

17:04.083 --> 17:05.666
I know! I have got

17:05.667 --> 17:07.250
the perfect way

17:04.083 --> 17:07.250
to end your movie!

I don't care if that

17:12.147 --> 17:13.291
evil mystic did turn

17:11.000 --> 17:13.291
you into a lizard.

17:13.334 --> 17:14.666

- a little rat blood.

Princess, I am so

17:22.565 --> 17:24.334
touched by your love,

17:24.375 --> 17:25.688

I cast upon him.

17:27.041 --> 17:29.000

- we dance!

17:29.042 --> 17:30.709
Wait, why?

17:30.751 --> 17:31.855
Because it is the end

17:31.856 --> 17:32.959
of a Bollywood movie.

17:30.751 --> 17:32.959
It is what we do!

18:11.876 --> 18:12.960

18:12.961 --> 18:14.042
out of my budget.

18:14.083 --> 18:15.751
- Along with
- waterproof mascara.

There's gotta

18:18.252 --> 18:19.459
be something

18:17.042 --> 18:19.459
you can do.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.210
Thanks, guys, but

18:21.211 --> 18:22.918
this whole thing

18:19.500 --> 18:22.918
was a disaster.

- And not only did I
- waste all of your time,

18:27.083 --> 18:28.542
Not to mention

18:28.543 --> 18:30.000
creating a big pile

18:27.083 --> 18:30.000

- Wait a minute, that
- shouldn't be on film.

19:14.083 --> 19:16.124
- That's what I - thought when I
- Read your script.

19:17.083 --> 19:18.563
No, I mean, I told

19:18.564 --> 19:20.042
Ravi to cut before

19:17.083 --> 19:20.042
that happened.

19:20.083 --> 19:21.563
Well, judging by

the fact that there is

eight hours of footage,

19:23.083 --> 19:25.000

- Wasn't in your script

19:35.083 --> 19:36.251
Is actually

19:36.252 --> 19:37.417
kind of entertaining.

19:37.459 --> 19:38.792
Wait a second.

19:39.042 --> 19:40.959
- Bertram, that gives
- me a great idea!

You're going to quit

- packed your bags.

- I know how I'm going - to finish my movie!
- Mmm.

- just for fun.

20:29.022 --> 20:30.083
Sometimes, the path

20:27.959 --> 20:30.083
to love can be paved

20:30.125 --> 20:32.000
- with a lot of bumps
- and bruises.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.584
And maybe things

20:36.585 --> 20:38.167
don't turn out exactly

20:35.000 --> 20:38.167
how you planned.

20:42.083 --> 20:43.980
But sometimes you find

20:43.981 --> 20:45.876
love in places that

20:42.083 --> 20:45.876
you least expect it.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.542
So even though

20:51.543 --> 20:53.000
I set out to shoot

20:50.083 --> 20:53.000

I do not know what

21:07.981 --> 21:09.042
was more beautiful,

21:09.083 --> 21:10.626
your poetic narration,

21:10.627 --> 21:12.167
or the way I framed

21:09.083 --> 21:12.167
that final shot.

21:13.834 --> 21:15.542
I can't believe you

21:15.543 --> 21:17.250
finished that whole thing

21:13.834 --> 21:17.250
in just 24 hours!

21:17.292 --> 21:18.668
Yeah, we never thought

21:18.669 --> 21:20.042
you could pull it off.

21:20.083 --> 21:21.083
But you guys seemed

21:21.084 --> 21:22.084
so supportive!

21:22.125 --> 21:24.042
- You know how when
- I have a math test,

21:24.083 --> 21:25.438
And you say I can

21:25.439 --> 21:26.792
ace it, but we both

21:24.083 --> 21:26.792
know you're lying?

21:26.834 --> 21:27.877
Yeah.

21:27.878 --> 21:28.918
It was like that.

21:30.083 --> 21:31.959
(SOBBING)

21:32.667 --> 21:33.730
Wow, it even

21:33.731 --> 21:34.792
made Bertram cry.

21:35.083 --> 21:36.500
It's not the movie.

21:36.542 --> 21:38.334
I just wasted 20 bucks

21:38.335 --> 21:40.125
on an "At Least

21:36.542 --> 21:40.125
You Tried" card.

about quitting

- and for letting
- you down.

22:14.083 --> 22:15.605
It was just awkward

22:15.606 --> 22:17.125
playing romantic scenes

22:14.083 --> 22:17.125
with my ex, you know?

22:17.167 --> 22:19.042
- It's okay. It was
- weird for me, too.

22:19.083 --> 22:20.542
- If it makes you
- feel better,

22:20.584 --> 22:21.647
I was pretending you

22:21.648 --> 22:22.709
were James Franco

22:20.584 --> 22:22.709
the whole time.

22:23.167 --> 22:24.480
You mean during

22:24.481 --> 22:25.792
the filming, or while

22:23.167 --> 22:25.792
we were dating?

22:27.042 --> 22:29.000
- Let's not re-hash
- the past.

22:30.083 --> 22:31.563
Oh, Tony, this is from

22:31.564 --> 22:33.042
The Quick Flicks Festival!

22:35.083 --> 22:36.292
- My film got
- accepted!

22:36.334 --> 22:38.292
- Congratulations!
- (LAUGHING)

22:39.083 --> 22:40.125
Oh, that's...

22:41.959 --> 22:43.685
- So, when do we - start filming
- The sequel?

22:43.709 --> 22:44.896
Well, I thought it was

22:44.897 --> 22:46.083
awkward for you

22:43.709 --> 22:46.083
playing my boyfriend.

22:46.125 --> 22:47.147
Awkward-schmawkward,

22:47.148 --> 22:48.167
this thing's a hit!

22:49.042 --> 22:50.310
- Okay, you can be in it
- if you can tell me

22:50.334 --> 22:52.125
- Just one of
- your lines.

22:54.083 --> 22:55.626
- Thought so.
- (ELEVATOR PINGS)

22:56.083 --> 22:57.083
Aw, man!

22:58.083 --> 22:59.083
That doesn't count.
