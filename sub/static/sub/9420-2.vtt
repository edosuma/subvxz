02:23.277 --> 02:25.344
He had stalked me for a year in

02:25.346 --> 02:26.645
My room through the webcam on my

02:26.647 --> 02:28.247
Computer.

02:30.417 --> 02:32.417
Out how to install some software

On your laptop so that your

02:33.487 --> 02:35.220
Webcam was always live streaming

02:35.222 --> 02:36.688
To him?

02:36.690 --> 02:38.423
>> yeah. He blackmailed me for

02:38.425 --> 02:40.058
Three months, knew, literally,

02:40.060 --> 02:41.493
Everything about me.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.628
He had photos of me putting on

02:42.630 --> 02:43.795
Outfits, then he started

02:43.797 --> 02:45.731
Photoshopping my face onto,

02:45.733 --> 02:47.099
Like, naked girls' bodies.

02:47.101 --> 02:48.167
>> whoa.

02:48.169 --> 02:49.268
>> he gave me three options

02:49.270 --> 02:50.936
And it was 1--to skype with him

02:50.938 --> 02:52.104
For five minutes and do whatever

02:52.106 --> 02:55.140
He said, 2--to snapchat him,

02:55.142 --> 02:56.575
Or 3--to send him better quality

02:56.577 --> 02:59.945
Photos from what he did have.

02:59.947 --> 03:02.181
Then the fbi got involved, so

03:02.183 --> 03:03.415
Now he's in prison.

>> jeez.

Just like i don't know where

04:44.351 --> 04:45.717
It's gonna lead.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.586
This was back in june.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.921
I made an okcupid profile.

04:49.923 --> 04:52.257
I saw this guy who i thought was

04:52.259 --> 04:53.258
Attractive.

04:53.260 --> 04:54.426
He said, "don't message me if

04:54.428 --> 04:56.561
You're just looking for sex."

04:56.563 --> 05:01.033

Guy who was looking for a

05:02.569 --> 05:04.770
Relationship.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.138
In my mind i'm like, "okay, this

05:06.140 --> 05:08.040
Is strange but, i mean, i'm

05:08.042 --> 05:09.074
Open-minded."

05:09.076 --> 05:10.676
So i gave him my number, and we

05:10.678 --> 05:12.678
Chatted for a little while.

05:12.680 --> 05:13.845
It was like, "oh, i really wanna

05:13.847 --> 05:15.314
Hang out, you seem so cool,

05:15.316 --> 05:16.281
You're so pretty, you're so

05:16.283 --> 05:17.849
Nice," so i thought i'd give it

05:17.851 --> 05:20.752
A whirl, and he sent me a text

05:20.754 --> 05:23.455
With a picture, and it was not

05:23.457 --> 05:25.390
The same person that was on his

05:25.392 --> 05:30.662
Profile.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.164
I, like, called him out.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.232
I was not interested any

05:34.234 --> 05:35.767
Further, so i completely cut him

05:35.769 --> 05:38.370
Off.

05:38.372 --> 05:39.304
I hadn't even given him a

05:40.507 --> 05:42.240
Call.

05:42.242 --> 05:44.643
I was like...Excuse me?

05:44.645 --> 05:46.645
I wanna know who this guy is,

05:46.647 --> 05:48.180
What his motivation is...

Either.

06:50.310 --> 06:51.610
>> well, this is a very

06:51.612 --> 06:52.844
Interesting story, because

06:52.846 --> 06:53.945
Courtney, she's not really

06:53.947 --> 06:55.147
A "hopeful."

06:55.149 --> 06:56.248
>> right, she didn't really ask

06:56.250 --> 06:57.616
For this.

06:57.618 --> 06:58.650
>> we're doing it because it's

06:58.652 --> 07:00.886
Sort of a necessary evil.

07:00.888 --> 07:03.522
Look at this fall foliage.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.157
You wanna do the honors?

07:05.159 --> 07:06.091
>> okay.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.860
[ding-dong]

07:08.862 --> 07:10.262
>> hey, guys.

07:10.264 --> 07:11.296
>> hello!

07:11.298 --> 07:12.297
>> how are you?

07:12.299 --> 07:13.265
>> i'm good, how are you?

07:13.267 --> 07:14.499
>> good to meet you in person.

07:14.501 --> 07:15.667
>> is it cool if they all come

07:15.669 --> 07:16.601
In too?

07:16.603 --> 07:17.569
>> yeah, absolutely.

07:17.571 --> 07:18.437
>> all right, come on, guys.

07:18.439 --> 07:19.738
>> sorry.

07:19.740 --> 07:20.639
>> is that little monster right

07:20.641 --> 07:21.673
There?

07:21.675 --> 07:22.641
>> there he is right there,

07:22.643 --> 07:23.575
Yeah...Cobin.

07:23.577 --> 07:24.409
>> oh, he's so cute.

07:24.411 --> 07:25.477
>> he looks like a rock star

07:25.479 --> 07:26.378
Baby somehow.

07:26.380 --> 07:27.245
>> both: Yeah.

07:27.247 --> 07:28.814
>> okay...

07:28.816 --> 07:31.983
So tell us all about yourself.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.452
>> i was born in anchorage,

07:33.454 --> 07:34.886
Alaska.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.121
My mom was a figure-skating

07:36.123 --> 07:37.556
Coach, had us skating three

07:37.558 --> 07:38.523
Times a day.

07:38.525 --> 07:40.425
I did that for seven years.

07:40.427 --> 07:41.426
>> whoa!

07:41.428 --> 07:42.427
>> so we ended up moving to

07:42.429 --> 07:43.795
Georgia, and then i met my son's

07:43.797 --> 07:45.330
Dad, and he was just a big

07:45.332 --> 07:47.032
Bundle of trouble, so...

07:47.034 --> 07:48.433
>> is he still in the picture?

07:48.435 --> 07:50.569
>> no. He's not around at all.

07:50.571 --> 07:51.837
Which is fine.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.572
>> but then, six months ago,

07:53.574 --> 07:55.640
You met isaak.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.409
You see in his profile that he

07:57.411 --> 07:58.877
Doesn't ever want to have sex.

07:58.879 --> 08:01.480
>> he sold me on this idea of

08:01.482 --> 08:03.615
Just hanging out with no

08:03.617 --> 08:04.916
Pressure.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.318
>> i mean, what kind of a lame

08:06.320 --> 08:08.420
Guy puts that in his profile?

08:08.422 --> 08:09.721
>> [laughs]

08:09.723 --> 08:10.822
>> why are we looking at

08:10.824 --> 08:11.756
Brandon?

08:11.758 --> 08:12.824
>> 'cause brandon's got a tinder

08:12.826 --> 08:14.459
That says "not looking for

08:14.461 --> 08:17.963
Hookup."

08:17.965 --> 08:19.197
So you're talking to isaak.

08:19.199 --> 08:20.565
>> we started texting, and he

08:20.567 --> 08:22.467
Was like, "i'll send you a pic,"

08:22.469 --> 08:23.568
And the picture he sent me

08:23.570 --> 08:25.303
Looked absolutely nothing like

08:25.305 --> 08:29.040
The pictures on the profile.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.208
Immediately i was like, who is

08:30.210 --> 08:31.142
That?

08:31.144 --> 08:32.777
And he was like, "uh...That's

08:32.779 --> 08:33.912
Me."

08:33.914 --> 08:35.380
I'm like, "no, it's not."

08:35.381 --> 08:36.914
I was just like, "no, we're not

08:36.917 --> 08:37.782
Hanging out."

08:37.784 --> 08:38.783
He's like, "are you sure?

08:38.784 --> 08:39.618
Is it still fine?

08:39.620 --> 08:40.652
Please tell me it's still fine

08:40.654 --> 08:41.553
And we can still hang out."

08:41.554 --> 08:42.888
I'm like, "no, we can't, no."

08:42.890 --> 08:44.289
Mm-mm.

08:44.291 --> 08:45.757
And then...

08:45.759 --> 08:47.325
He kept texting.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.294
>> it's pretty obsessive of him

08:49.296 --> 08:50.462
From only talking to you for a

08:50.464 --> 08:51.396
Couple of weeks.

08:51.398 --> 08:52.697
>> i wanna hear him explain

08:52.699 --> 08:53.865
Everything.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.333
Maybe he'll give me some answers

08:55.335 --> 08:57.903
For why my guy did it to me too.

08:57.905 --> 08:58.870
This, i think, will be good for

08:58.872 --> 09:00.171
Both you and i.

09:00.173 --> 09:01.206
>> all right, let's go check it

09:01.208 --> 09:02.140
Out.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.775
So this is currently the profile

09:03.777 --> 09:05.110
For isaak.

09:05.112 --> 09:06.378
Just right off the bat:

09:06.380 --> 09:07.913
"hi. I have three college

09:07.915 --> 09:09.180
Degrees, and i do massage

09:09.182 --> 09:10.682
Therapy."

09:10.684 --> 09:12.918
Last online--this morning.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.152
Wow, so he's still very active

09:14.154 --> 09:15.253
On here.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.421
>> mm-hmm.

09:16.423 --> 09:17.455
>> let's take a closer look at

09:17.457 --> 09:18.456
These profile pictures.

09:18.458 --> 09:19.324
That was what you saw initially.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.325
>> that's what i saw.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.027
>> he looks nice.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.128
>> here he is with some friends.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.296
>> on the left, yeah, supposedly

09:24.298 --> 09:26.131
With some friends, whatever.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.032
And i'm still thinking, "uh, you

09:27.034 --> 09:27.933
Know, okay, cool."

09:27.935 --> 09:28.900
>> yeah, all right...

09:28.902 --> 09:29.935
>> he has friends...

09:29.937 --> 09:31.403
>> when i got the picture that

09:31.405 --> 09:33.204
He texted me, it looked nothing

09:33.206 --> 09:34.506
Like the pictures on the

09:34.508 --> 09:35.640
Profile.

09:35.642 --> 09:36.708
[dramatic music]

09:36.710 --> 09:38.176
>> what?

09:38.178 --> 09:39.277
Whoa!

09:39.279 --> 09:41.279
So different.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.547
>> we know very little about

09:42.549 --> 09:43.715
This guy.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.116
Is isaak even his real name?

09:45.118 --> 09:46.484
We don't know anything.

09:46.486 --> 09:47.986
So before we kind of reach out

09:47.988 --> 09:49.654
To this guy, i'd like to know

09:49.656 --> 09:51.256
More about him primarily just to

09:51.258 --> 09:52.524
Be sure that we're not dealing

09:52.526 --> 09:53.358
With a criminal.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.359
>> yeah.

09:54.361 --> 09:55.193
>> i wanna know.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.294
I wanna know why.

09:56.296 --> 09:57.796
>> i want answers for you.

09:57.798 --> 09:58.997
You know?

09:58.999 --> 10:01.766
Like i wanna know too.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.234
>> thanks, guys.

10:03.236 --> 10:04.269
I feel a lot better...

10:04.271 --> 10:05.203
>> don't worry.

10:05.205 --> 10:05.937
>> knowing that y'all are...

10:05.939 --> 10:06.805
>> yeah.

10:06.807 --> 10:07.739
>> around to help.

10:07.741 --> 10:08.573
>> you're not alone.

10:08.575 --> 10:09.808
>> i've been through this, so i

10:09.810 --> 10:10.775
Know.

10:10.777 --> 10:11.743
>> awesome.

10:11.745 --> 10:12.744
>> yeah. Good to meet you.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.813
>> yeah, you too.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.214
>> i mean, this guy is really

10:16.216 --> 10:18.350
Prepared to do anything to get

10:18.352 --> 10:19.417
This girl's attention, and

10:19.419 --> 10:20.885
That's a big concern.

10:20.887 --> 10:22.087
>> it happened to me, but, like

10:22.089 --> 10:23.488
It's so weird seeing it happen

10:23.490 --> 10:24.756
To someone else.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.157
This gives me the chills, like

10:26.159 --> 10:28.860
Thinking about it.

10:32.064 --> 10:34.299

♪ for each other ♪

10:37.938 --> 10:38.837
Chairs.

10:38.839 --> 10:39.638
>> i know, it's actually fun.

10:39.640 --> 10:40.438
I'm like, "whee!"

10:40.440 --> 10:42.240
>> so...Here's what we know.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.476
Courtney went online.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.011
She meets this guy.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.212
>> both: Isaak.

10:47.214 --> 10:48.380
>> he's not interested in sex

10:48.382 --> 10:49.848
At all.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.116
Courtney's kinda curious.

10:51.118 --> 10:53.485
He then sends her a picture,

10:53.487 --> 10:55.520
And it's a guy that definitely

10:55.522 --> 10:56.588
Doesn't look like the guy she

10:56.590 --> 10:58.023
Thought she was talking to.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.324
Courtney says no thanks...

10:59.326 --> 11:00.392
>> yeah.

11:00.394 --> 11:02.494
>> only to find out that he has

11:02.496 --> 11:04.362
Created a fake email,

11:04.364 --> 11:06.131
Impersonating her, to reach out

11:06.133 --> 11:08.233
To our casting team saying how

11:08.235 --> 11:09.601
Much she wants to meet this guy

11:09.603 --> 11:10.635
She met online, which is

11:10.637 --> 11:11.603
Obviously not the case.

11:11.605 --> 11:12.837
>> right.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.005
>> priority number one, though,

11:14.007 --> 11:15.373
Is basically making sure that

11:15.375 --> 11:16.808
This guy, whoever he is, isn't

11:16.810 --> 11:18.109
Dangerous.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.577
>> right.

11:19.579 --> 11:20.945
>> let's run the picture on his

11:20.947 --> 11:23.081
Dating profile that looks like

11:23.083 --> 11:23.748
A heat shot.

11:23.750 --> 11:24.783
>> head shot.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.351
I've never done this before.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.285
>> got him!

11:27.287 --> 11:28.119
>> ah!

11:28.121 --> 11:29.754
>> oh, my god.

11:29.756 --> 11:31.589
A lotta hits on this picture.

On with the same picture, same

11:38.098 --> 11:39.130
User name.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.832
He copy/pasted all of his same,

11:40.834 --> 11:42.067
Like who i am and what i'm

11:42.069 --> 11:43.001
Looking for.

11:43.003 --> 11:43.968
That seems kind of weird.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.403
>> that's really creepy.

11:45.405 --> 11:46.438
>> let's just quickly do an

11:46.440 --> 11:47.706

35:31.430 --> 35:32.496
>> i would never in a million

35:32.498 --> 35:34.231
Years do anything like that.

35:34.233 --> 35:35.765
>> it's similar in a sense.

35:35.767 --> 35:36.700
>> i just wanted to make it

35:36.702 --> 35:38.435
Clear that i admit what i did

35:38.437 --> 35:40.470
Was wrong by using a fake photo.

35:40.472 --> 35:41.638
>> yeah, i mean, you do

35:41.640 --> 35:42.706
Definitely understand it's not

35:42.708 --> 35:44.441
Okay.

35:44.443 --> 35:45.842
>> yeah.

35:45.844 --> 35:47.077
>> there were a couple things

35:47.079 --> 35:48.612
That we heard...

35:48.614 --> 35:49.546
>> okay.

35:49.548 --> 35:51.314
>> in our investigation.

35:51.316 --> 35:52.883
We spoke to a girl named karla.

35:52.885 --> 35:53.817
Someone had told her that you

35:53.819 --> 35:54.985
Showed up looking for her at

35:54.987 --> 35:56.419
Her job, and she had been a

35:56.421 --> 35:57.888
Little curious as to what your

35:57.890 --> 35:59.656
Intentions were.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.858
>> all i remember is when i

36:01.860 --> 36:02.993
Stopped working there, i did go

36:02.995 --> 36:03.927
Back.

36:03.929 --> 36:04.928
I was catching up with some of

36:04.930 --> 36:05.929
The people who worked there.

36:05.931 --> 36:06.897
And in my conversations with the

36:06.899 --> 36:08.298
Coworkers, my only guess is

36:08.300 --> 36:10.300
Maybe her name came up, and then

36:10.302 --> 36:11.968
After i left, one of them said,

36:11.970 --> 36:13.303
"oh, he was here, and he

36:13.305 --> 36:14.404
Mentioned you."

36:14.406 --> 36:15.338
And that may have been

36:15.340 --> 36:16.506
Over-exaggerated into, "oh, my

36:16.508 --> 36:17.941
Gosh, he came here to see me."

36:17.943 --> 36:18.808
Things can easily get

36:18.810 --> 36:19.709
Misunderstood with girls

36:19.711 --> 36:21.077
Sometimes.

36:21.079 --> 36:22.279
>> can i ask you--we saw a bunch

36:22.281 --> 36:23.747
Of posts regarding the <i> judge</i>

36:23.749 --> 36:25.982
<i>Mathis</i> appearance?

36:25.984 --> 36:27.050
>> i did sue a girl.

36:27.052 --> 36:28.051
She owed me a small amount of

36:28.053 --> 36:28.952
Rent.

36:28.954 --> 36:29.853
But, of course, you know, with

36:29.855 --> 36:31.254
Statesboro being a small town,

36:31.256 --> 36:32.589
Everyone has something

36:32.591 --> 36:34.157
Clever and negative to say.

36:34.159 --> 36:35.625
>> well, was there any element

36:35.627 --> 36:37.961
Of foot-related...

36:37.963 --> 36:38.995
>> i agreed to loan her the

36:38.997 --> 36:40.397
Money, and then i did point out

36:40.399 --> 36:41.665
That i have--i am a massage

36:41.667 --> 36:42.866
"therapist."

36:42.868 --> 36:43.967
But i wasn't just giving a foot

36:43.969 --> 36:45.001
Massage.

36:45.003 --> 36:46.603
>> you didn't give her the money

36:46.605 --> 36:48.238
In exchange for her letting

You...

>> massage.

>> massage her feet?

36:51.410 --> 36:52.342
>> well, i never gave her the

36:52.344 --> 36:55.545
Money--it was a loan.

36:55.547 --> 36:56.780
Yeah.

36:56.782 --> 36:58.882
>> all right.

37:02.653 --> 37:04.154
>> we were kind of curious,

37:04.156 --> 37:05.355
What's it been like for you

37:05.357 --> 37:06.523
Growing up?

37:06.525 --> 37:08.758
>> well, growing up, i thought i

37:08.760 --> 37:10.260
Was normal in the sense that i

37:10.262 --> 37:11.928
Did find women attractive, and

37:11.930 --> 37:12.929
Girls, you know, i found them

37:12.931 --> 37:14.564
Attractive in an innocent way.

37:14.566 --> 37:15.899
But, unlike other guys, i didn't

37:15.901 --> 37:18.168
Like...Wanna act on it.

37:18.170 --> 37:19.135
I didn't know that i was

37:19.137 --> 37:20.136
Different.

37:20.138 --> 37:21.204
The only thing i knew about me

37:21.206 --> 37:22.072
That was different was that i

37:22.074 --> 37:24.040
Noticed classmates dating,

37:24.042 --> 37:25.375
Having girlfriends, and i was

37:25.377 --> 37:27.277
Just happy just being friends.

37:27.279 --> 37:28.511
I didn't know about sex till i

37:28.513 --> 37:30.180
Was almost 20.

37:30.182 --> 37:31.248
I thought it was just a way of

37:31.250 --> 37:32.115
Having a baby.

37:32.117 --> 37:33.183
I didn't know it was something

37:33.185 --> 37:34.251
That couples did regularly for

37:34.253 --> 37:35.418
Pleasure at all.

37:35.420 --> 37:36.920
>> surely, you must have been

37:36.922 --> 37:38.888
Exposed to...The concept of

37:38.890 --> 37:40.090
Casual sex for pleasure

37:40.092 --> 37:41.091
Through--

37:41.093 --> 37:42.025

37:42.928 --> 37:43.927

37:43.929 --> 37:44.894
Without cable until i was almost

37:44.896 --> 37:45.862
In high school.

37:45.864 --> 37:48.265
Second, um...My mom was very

37:48.267 --> 37:49.332
Picky about the shows we can

37:49.334 --> 37:50.567
Watch so, yeah, i never came

37:50.569 --> 37:52.435
Across that stuff.

>> you never really got a talk

37:54.306 --> 37:55.438
From your parents and none of

37:56.608 --> 37:57.707
Up?

37:57.709 --> 37:58.742
>> never. I didn't have a lot of

37:58.744 --> 37:59.643
Guy friends.

37:59.645 --> 38:00.543
I've been judged:

38:00.545 --> 38:01.845
"that guy's effing weird!

38:01.847 --> 38:03.079
Not into sex?"

38:03.081 --> 38:04.748
People brought to my attention

38:04.750 --> 38:06.583
The term being asexual.

38:06.585 --> 38:07.751
I'm just made differently.

38:07.753 --> 38:08.818
I didn't choose it, i didn't

38:08.820 --> 38:10.053
Desire it, i didn't just think

38:10.055 --> 38:11.321
One day, "okay, i'm not gonna be

38:11.323 --> 38:12.489
Into sex."

38:12.491 --> 38:14.024

Homosexual, whatever you

38:17.062 --> 38:18.461
Identify as, you need to embrace

It.

Of my life.

Doesn't want that contact.
