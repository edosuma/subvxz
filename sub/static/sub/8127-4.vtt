Hi, Ma. I just love             
rainy days, don't you?          

00:56.890 --> 00:59.858
Yeah. It was raining            
on our honeymoon.               

00:59.860 --> 01:01.860
        Oh, that's romantic--   

01:01.862 --> 01:04.529
         you and Daddy          
         in your cozy hotel room

01:04.531 --> 01:06.464
                in Atlantic City
                in the rain.    

01:06.466 --> 01:08.800
Oh, it wasn't                   
so romantic.                    

01:08.802 --> 01:10.301
Archie was so mad.              

01:10.303 --> 01:11.302
He kept saying,                 

01:11.304 --> 01:13.604
"Here we are,                   
stuck in this hotel room

                Oh, Ma... no.

    Hey, did I tell you         
    that riddle Tammy told me   

01:21.548 --> 01:23.614
        about the surgeon       
        who couldn't operate?   

01:23.616 --> 01:24.615

Oh, excuse me, Gloria.          

01:27.554 --> 01:28.953
The sweet rolls are ready,      

01:28.955 --> 01:31.622
      and Archie hates it       
     when the sugar drips.      

01:32.692 --> 01:33.692
                    Gloria...   

01:33.694 --> 01:35.160
  Good morning, Michael, dear.  

01:35.162 --> 01:36.527
             Never mind         
             the "good morning."

01:36.529 --> 01:38.797
            Look at this.       
            See that?           

01:38.799 --> 01:40.598
        I'm sick and tired      
        of putting on this shirt

01:40.600 --> 01:42.200
         every time             
         you wash it, Gloria,   

01:42.202 --> 01:43.668
          and finding there's   
          no button there.      

01:43.670 --> 01:45.804
                Look at that.   
All right, Michael.             

01:45.806 --> 01:48.039
    Gloria, didn't I tell you   
    to fix it? Didn't I?        

01:48.041 --> 01:49.640
      All right, Michael.       
         I'm busy now.          

01:49.642 --> 01:51.076
    I'll do it later.           

01:51.078 --> 01:53.178
     Gloria, this has been      
going on for three weeks!       

01:53.180 --> 01:54.045
         Sew it on now!         

01:55.480 --> 01:56.581
Sew it on yourself!             

01:56.583 --> 01:57.982
             What?              

02:00.186 --> 02:01.186
Where's it                      
written down                    

02:01.188 --> 02:03.487
that a woman has to do          
all the sewing?                 

02:03.489 --> 02:05.389
    Gloria, you're my wife!     

02:05.391 --> 02:06.991
What's that got                 
to do with it?                  

02:06.993 --> 02:08.425
You sew it on!                  

02:08.428 --> 02:09.426
                  Well, I can't.

02:09.429 --> 02:10.294
Why not?                        

02:11.997 --> 02:13.598
    You got the sewing kit!     

02:14.767 --> 02:16.667
            Well, I'll go get it
            for you right now.  

02:16.669 --> 02:18.103
No. No. No.                     
Wait a second.                  

02:18.105 --> 02:20.805
Gloria, I mean, uh,             
you do it better than me.       

02:20.807 --> 02:22.240
You always do it.               

02:22.242 --> 02:25.243
That's because I want to,       
  not because you order me to.  

02:25.245 --> 02:26.211
Okay, forget it!                

02:27.579 --> 02:30.448
             Ma, could you sew  
             a button on for me?

02:30.450 --> 02:31.449
          Sure, Mike.           

02:31.451 --> 02:32.751
No, you don't, Ma.              

02:32.753 --> 02:34.585
He's gonna                      
do it himself.                  

02:34.587 --> 02:38.089
    Oh, I didn't know           
    you liked sewing, Mike.     

02:38.091 --> 02:39.758
                      I don't!  
                      I hate it!

02:39.760 --> 02:41.525
                     Forget it! 
                     I'll do it!

02:41.527 --> 02:42.660
                     I'll do it!

        Meathead,               

02:43.663 --> 02:44.963
      do it in quiet, huh.      

02:44.965 --> 02:47.365
Okay!                           

02:47.367 --> 02:49.000
  What's the matter with him?   

02:49.002 --> 02:50.735
         Can't a person         
 get a cheerful "good morning"  

02:50.737 --> 02:52.170
      around here no more?      

02:52.172 --> 02:53.872
[CHEERFULLY]                    
Good morning!                   

03:01.046 --> 03:02.247
            Not from you, Edith.

03:02.249 --> 03:05.250
            We already seen     
            each other upstairs.

03:05.252 --> 03:08.452
Yeah, but that was              
lying down.                     

03:10.790 --> 03:12.824
Remember, Archie?               

03:12.826 --> 03:15.260
We both woke up together,       

03:15.262 --> 03:16.995
and we looked at each other,    

03:16.997 --> 03:19.164
and I said,                     
"Good morning, Archie,"         

03:19.166 --> 03:20.765
and you rolled over.            

03:25.938 --> 03:28.173
         Edith, where's         
    my regular prune juice?     

03:28.175 --> 03:29.974
      This ain't Sunsweet.      

03:29.976 --> 03:31.542
Oh, I'm sorry, Archie.          

03:31.544 --> 03:33.678
Ferguson's market               
was sold out,                   

03:33.680 --> 03:35.814
but Sybil Gooley                
at the checkout stand           

03:35.816 --> 03:38.917
said this kind                  
tasted just the same.           

03:38.919 --> 03:40.218
    Well, tell Sybil Gooley     

03:40.220 --> 03:42.854
I don't drink prune juice       
         for the taste.         

03:47.226 --> 03:49.928
    I know.                     

03:49.930 --> 03:51.095
          And look at this here.

03:51.097 --> 03:53.664
  The eggs ain't runny enough,  
             Edith.             

03:53.666 --> 03:56.600
 How am I going to dip my toast 
    into a hard yolk?           

03:56.602 --> 03:58.870
Complaints,                     
complaints...                   

03:58.872 --> 04:01.005
First Michael,                  
now you, Daddy.                 

04:01.007 --> 04:03.374
You men treat us                
like unpaid servants.           

04:03.376 --> 04:05.243
That's what we are              
to you-- servants.              

04:05.245 --> 04:06.878
"Cook this,                     
clean that, sew this."          

04:06.880 --> 04:08.446
            Come on.            
            Will you let me eat?

04:10.049 --> 04:13.151
             EDITH:             
    Mike, what did you          
    do to your finger?          

04:15.020 --> 04:16.254
Nothing, Ma.                    

04:16.255 --> 04:17.521
        Did you cut yourself,   
        Michael?                

04:17.523 --> 04:20.291
Yeah. I'm just acting silly     
over that stupid button.        

04:20.293 --> 04:21.659
                      I'm sorry.

04:21.661 --> 04:24.262
No. You were right.             
I was wrong.                    

04:25.998 --> 04:27.098
                      Oh, Edith,

04:27.100 --> 04:28.766
             do they have to be 
             slobbering that way

04:28.768 --> 04:29.633
    on a Sunday morning here?   

04:31.470 --> 04:32.770
                 How did you    
                 do it, Michael?

04:32.772 --> 04:35.706
I stuck my finger               
trying to sew the button on.    

04:35.708 --> 04:38.109
    Oh, wait a minute.          
         Wait a minute.         

04:38.111 --> 04:40.211
    You, the husband,           
     were sewing something?     

04:40.213 --> 04:41.612
 Yeah. What's wrong with that?  

04:41.614 --> 04:44.648
    Well, if you don't know,    
    I ain't gonna tell you.     

04:46.718 --> 04:49.320
          Well, tell me, because
          I don't know either.  

04:49.322 --> 04:50.621
    He's the husband.           

04:50.623 --> 04:52.023
            He ain't            
supposed to be doing that.      

04:52.025 --> 04:53.157
     That's the wife's job.     

04:53.159 --> 04:55.894
        That is nothing         
but a male chauvinist attitude! 

04:55.896 --> 04:58.029
  Will you tell me something?   

04:58.031 --> 05:01.432
 What is this "male chauvinist" 
  you keep throwing up at me?   

05:01.434 --> 05:03.834
 It's not a "what," it's a who. 

05:03.836 --> 05:05.203
            You see,            
there was this Frenchman,       

05:05.205 --> 05:06.905
and his name was Chauvin,       

05:06.907 --> 05:08.873
        and he was              
    the original chauvinist.    

05:08.875 --> 05:12.110
And he was a beautiful          
piano player too.               

05:16.648 --> 05:17.748
MICHAEL: What?                  

05:17.750 --> 05:19.250
Yeah, Chauvin.                  

05:19.252 --> 05:23.721
Cornel Wilde took his part      
in the picture...               

05:23.723 --> 05:26.657
and he wrote                    
some lovely songs:              

05:26.659 --> 05:29.660
¶ I'm always                    
Chasing rain... ¶               

05:29.662 --> 05:32.397
        All right! All right.   
        Put a lid on it, huh.   

05:32.399 --> 05:34.299
Ma, that's Chopin.              

05:34.301 --> 05:35.934
Chauvin was an officer          
with Napoleon.                  

05:35.936 --> 05:38.836
         Well, what has         
      a dead frog soldier       

05:38.838 --> 05:39.971
    got to do with me?          

05:39.973 --> 05:41.472
          Everything.           

05:41.474 --> 05:44.008
            You see,            
Chauvin was a stupid nationalist

05:44.010 --> 05:46.177
          who believed          
that everything French was best,

05:46.179 --> 05:47.412
  and that women were no good.  

05:47.414 --> 05:48.579
                Well, who cares?

05:48.581 --> 05:49.713
            All I'm saying is   

05:49.715 --> 05:51.615
              no self-respecting
              American husband  

05:51.617 --> 05:53.717
        would do his own sewing.

05:53.719 --> 05:56.720
Oh, what about                  
Dr. Nelson, the surgeon?        

05:56.722 --> 05:59.657
He does a lot of sewing.        

05:59.659 --> 06:02.427
              On people, Edith--
              he sews on people.

06:02.429 --> 06:04.895
    Well, he must have          
     practiced on something     

06:04.897 --> 06:06.264
  before he started on people.  

06:09.401 --> 06:11.035
That reminds me, Gloria--       

06:11.037 --> 06:13.504
     you were gonna tell me     
something about a surgeon       

06:13.506 --> 06:14.772
    and you never finished.     

06:14.774 --> 06:15.974
             Well, yeah.        
             That was the riddle

06:15.976 --> 06:17.241
             that Tammy Robinson
             told me.           

06:17.243 --> 06:18.776
                 I bet you'll   
                 never guess it.

06:18.778 --> 06:19.978
Who's Tammy Robinson?           

06:19.980 --> 06:21.212
              Oh, she's the girl

06:21.214 --> 06:22.813
      that's running            
      the female fair exhibition

06:22.815 --> 06:24.082
              down at the store.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.283
          She's coming          
          over here this morning

06:25.285 --> 06:26.617
        so we can work on it.   

06:26.619 --> 06:28.386
     Oh, what's she coming      
         over here for?         

06:28.388 --> 06:31.589
     Can't we have a Sunday     
in this house with no visitors? 

06:31.591 --> 06:33.124
  What a day this is gonna be.  

06:33.126 --> 06:34.925
          And look at           
  that rain out there, Edith!   

06:34.927 --> 06:36.894
    I'm sorry, Archie.          

06:36.896 --> 06:40.798
     Daddy, you've got her      
    saying she's sorry          

06:40.800 --> 06:42.700
like it's her fault             
it's raining.                   

06:42.702 --> 06:44.435
    Well, it ain't my fault.    

06:45.570 --> 06:48.606
Well, tell us                   
about the riddle.               

06:48.608 --> 06:52.477
      Okay. Now, you see,       
there's this father and his son,

06:52.479 --> 06:54.512
and they're driving along       
        in a car,               

06:54.514 --> 06:57.648
      and the car crashes,      
and the father is killed.       

06:57.650 --> 06:59.417
Oh, that's so sad.              

06:59.419 --> 07:02.420
        Oh, jeez,               
it's only a story, Edith.       

07:02.422 --> 07:04.522
 Anyway, the father is killed,  

07:04.524 --> 07:06.391
    and the little boy          
    is badly injured,           

07:06.393 --> 07:07.858
so they rush him to a hospital, 

07:07.860 --> 07:09.660
         take him into          
      the operating room.       

07:09.662 --> 07:13.297
 The surgeon walks in and says, 
 "I can't operate on this boy.  

07:13.299 --> 07:14.832
         He's my son."          

07:14.834 --> 07:16.667
        How come?               

07:16.669 --> 07:17.902
    Well, that's easy.          

07:17.904 --> 07:19.270
  The surgeon was his father.   

07:19.272 --> 07:21.539
    Well, he ain't supposed     
 to operate on his own family.  

07:21.541 --> 07:23.341
    Daddy, I just said          
     the father was killed.     

07:23.343 --> 07:26.244
        Oh, then it was         
the stepfather was killed       

07:26.246 --> 07:27.545
    and the surgeon's           
        the real father.        

07:27.547 --> 07:29.713
              No.               

07:29.715 --> 07:31.249
    I know!                     

07:31.251 --> 07:34.318
The surgeon                     
was a Christian Scientist.      

07:34.320 --> 07:35.520
They never operate.             

07:42.261 --> 07:45.829
    How could the surgeon be    
 a Christian Scientist, Edith?  

07:45.831 --> 07:48.499
         Them dumbbells         
don't even allow sickness.      

07:50.969 --> 07:53.037
    If the father was dead,     
     what's the difference      

07:53.039 --> 07:54.805
  what kind of a religious nut  
            he was?             

07:54.807 --> 07:58.376
Hey... the father was a priest, 
             right?             

07:58.378 --> 07:59.677
Like a Catholic father.         

07:59.679 --> 08:02.246
        No, it was a real father
        and his real son.       

08:02.248 --> 08:04.115
Hmm...Let me get this straight: 

08:04.117 --> 08:06.417
    A father and a son          
      were in a car crash.      

08:06.419 --> 08:07.518
     The father is killed,      

08:07.520 --> 08:09.153
          and the son           
is rushed to the hospital.      

08:09.155 --> 08:10.654
They bring him to surgery.      

08:10.656 --> 08:12.957
    Surgeon walks in, says,     
 "I can't operate on that boy.  

08:12.959 --> 08:13.958
         He's my son."          

08:13.960 --> 08:15.426
                That's right.   

08:15.428 --> 08:18.262
All right. Is it a case         
of mistaken identity?           

08:18.264 --> 08:19.263
                That's wrong.   

08:19.265 --> 08:20.898
        Of course it's wrong.   

08:20.900 --> 08:22.666
Well, how can you               
be so sure?                     

08:22.668 --> 08:23.934
You don't know                  
the answer.                     

08:23.936 --> 08:25.970
            Well, I know that it
            ain't the answer.   

08:25.972 --> 08:28.573
Well, maybe the answer          
has something to do             

08:28.575 --> 08:31.976
with people that come back      
from the hereafter,             

08:31.978 --> 08:34.145
like that milk company.         

08:35.679 --> 08:36.679
    Oh, reincarnation?          

08:36.682 --> 08:37.548
                        Yeah!   

08:44.889 --> 08:47.558
         No. No, that's         
      not the answer, Ma.       

08:47.560 --> 08:48.792
     You give up, Michael?      

08:48.794 --> 08:50.995
            Yeah. Yeah.         
            Michael gives up.   

08:50.997 --> 08:51.996
              What's the answer?

08:51.998 --> 08:53.231
            No. No.             
        I don't give up.        

08:53.233 --> 08:54.832
         I bet I get it         
         before you do.         

08:54.834 --> 08:55.866
                  What are you  
                  talking about?

08:55.868 --> 08:56.867
            A quarter you don't.

08:56.869 --> 08:57.868
        Yeah. You're on.        

08:57.870 --> 08:59.103
         You want to make a bet?

08:59.105 --> 09:00.271
                        Okay.   
             Sure.              

09:00.273 --> 09:02.140
        Gloria, don't be        
        telling him the answer. 

09:02.142 --> 09:03.474
            No cheating here.   

09:03.476 --> 09:04.708
                Go on, Edith.   

09:04.710 --> 09:06.710
      Get my coffee and bring it
      over here, will you?      

09:06.712 --> 09:10.881
 Tammy is so smart to think up  
    a hard riddle like that.    

09:10.883 --> 09:12.683
         She didn't think it up.

09:12.685 --> 09:13.951
How do you know she didn't?     

09:13.953 --> 09:16.354
        Because riddles         
    ain't thought up.           

09:16.356 --> 09:20.258
         They come out          
  of newspapers and magazines.  

09:20.260 --> 09:22.260
    Well, Tammy could           
      have thought it up.       

09:22.262 --> 09:24.195
She's a very clever girl.       

09:24.197 --> 09:26.531
You know, the whole female fair 
    was all her idea.           

09:26.533 --> 09:28.899
  "Female fair"? What's that?   

09:28.901 --> 09:31.302
     Oh, it's Tammy's idea      
    for an exhibition           

09:31.304 --> 09:33.137
on the women's liberation       
        movement.               

09:33.139 --> 09:35.773
     Ah, good night, nurse.     
      Another one of them.      

09:35.775 --> 09:37.575
You letting your wife get       
    mixed up in that?           

09:37.577 --> 09:38.609
                        Why not?

09:38.611 --> 09:40.711
         Why not--              
         because I got a feeling

09:40.713 --> 09:45.316
    that female fairs           
is run by female fairies.       

09:46.885 --> 09:48.819
That's a horrible               
thing to say                    

09:48.821 --> 09:50.254
about my friend Tammy.          

09:50.256 --> 09:54.792
I know a female fairy,          
and she ain't horrible.         

09:54.794 --> 09:56.994
            What female fairy   
            do you know?        

09:56.996 --> 09:59.297
    Tinkerbell in <i>Peter Pan.</i>    

10:01.132 --> 10:05.636
    Yeah... I remember when     
I was a freshman in high school,

10:05.638 --> 10:08.706
        the senior class        
    put on <i>Peter Pan.</i>           

10:08.708 --> 10:12.109
    Oh, it was so beautiful,    
            I cried.            

10:12.111 --> 10:14.078
I'll never forget               
how Peter Pan                   

10:14.080 --> 10:16.447
talked to the audience.         

10:16.449 --> 10:19.116
        Peter was played        
        by Spunky Finch,        

10:19.118 --> 10:22.386
     and she had new braces     
         on her teeth,          

10:22.388 --> 10:26.657
and as soon as the spotlight hit
     all that silver wire,      

10:26.659 --> 10:28.492
          oh, it just           
      gave you goosebumps.      

10:30.495 --> 10:36.467
Well, anyway, Peter said,       
  "Do you believe in fairies?   

10:36.469 --> 10:38.636
 "Say it quick if you believe.  

10:38.638 --> 10:41.038
        If you believe,         
    clap your hands!"           

10:44.576 --> 10:47.378
    And then everybody          
      clapped their hands,      

10:47.380 --> 10:51.582
  and Peter said, "Thank you!   
     Thank you! Thank you!"     

10:53.318 --> 10:56.420
"And now to rescue Wendy!"      

10:56.422 --> 10:59.423
Oh, oh, oh! I just love theater.

11:00.559 --> 11:03.294
      Is the curtain down?      

11:03.296 --> 11:05.062
                    Yeah.       

11:05.064 --> 11:06.364
Good, because                   
I got the answer                

11:06.366 --> 11:07.898
to that there riddle            
over there.                     

11:07.900 --> 11:10.434
 The kid on the operating table 
      was his own double.       

11:13.972 --> 11:14.972
                    What?       

11:14.974 --> 11:16.073
        Double. Double.         

11:16.075 --> 11:17.275
You know what a double is.      

11:17.277 --> 11:19.277
         They got them          
  in all their stories there,   

11:19.279 --> 11:23.648
     like in that picture,      
  <i>The Prince and the Porpoise.</i>  

11:23.650 --> 11:25.916
No, Daddy.                      
That's not the answer.          

11:25.918 --> 11:27.050
                Wrong.          

11:27.052 --> 11:29.086
  Well, any jerk can sit there  
        saying, "Wrong."        

11:29.088 --> 11:30.688
        I don't hear you        
    coming up with nothing!     

11:30.690 --> 11:32.890
          Hey, we got a bet     
          that I come up with it

11:32.892 --> 11:33.924
         before you, that's all.

11:33.926 --> 11:35.793
        Aw.                     
                I'd better clear
                the table.      

11:35.795 --> 11:36.894
Oh, I'll help you, Ma.          

11:36.896 --> 11:37.895
I'll help you too.              

11:37.897 --> 11:39.430
         Wait a minute!         

11:39.432 --> 11:41.865
 I don't want all of yous going 
 in the kitchen together there. 

11:41.867 --> 11:43.668
She'll be giving him the answer 
        behind my back.         

11:43.670 --> 11:45.469
        Gloria, don't you say   
        nothing to him in there!

11:45.471 --> 11:46.470
  I won't say anything, Daddy.  

11:46.472 --> 11:47.471
                 You keep an eye

11:47.473 --> 11:48.673

17:03.789 --> 17:07.023
     "For man is the image      
    and glory of God,           

17:07.026 --> 17:09.093
         but the woman          
     is the glory of man."      

17:09.095 --> 17:11.694
  St. Paul, First Corinthians,  
        11, verse seven.        

17:11.696 --> 17:12.796
                That's terrible.

17:12.798 --> 17:14.698
    That's beautiful.           
        It's the Bible.         

17:14.700 --> 17:16.000
    Wait a minute.              

17:16.002 --> 17:17.201
You've gotta hear               
this one too.                   

17:17.203 --> 17:18.801
You wanna hear                  
what the orthodox Jew says      

17:18.804 --> 17:20.436
every morning                   
in his prayers?                 

17:20.439 --> 17:21.972
I can live without it.          

17:25.911 --> 17:28.645
    "Blessed art thou,          
        O Lord our God,         

17:28.647 --> 17:31.115
 that I was not born a woman."  

17:31.117 --> 17:33.083
Well, like I always say,        

17:33.085 --> 17:35.052
there's some good               
in all religions.               

17:36.254 --> 17:38.188
What about this from the Koran: 

17:38.190 --> 17:40.490
"Men are superior to women      

17:40.492 --> 17:43.093
because God has given them      
         pre-eminence."         

17:43.095 --> 17:44.428
      That's really awful.      

17:44.430 --> 17:45.930
            When I hear         
            things like that,   

17:45.932 --> 17:48.098
                 I thank God    
                 I'm an atheist.

17:56.908 --> 17:58.409
Listen, Tammy, there,           

17:58.411 --> 18:01.045
            I hope,             
on top of everything else,      

18:01.047 --> 18:02.612
     you ain't one of them      
          unbelievers,          

18:02.614 --> 18:04.014
 like that Meathead over here.  

18:04.016 --> 18:06.116
            Oh, no,             
  I go to church, Mr. Bunker,   

18:06.118 --> 18:08.319
but I don't have to agree       
 with everything in <i>The Bible.</i>  

18:08.321 --> 18:10.354
         I don't think          
    that men have the right     

18:10.356 --> 18:12.056
to control women's lives.       

18:12.058 --> 18:13.824
Yeah, like abortion laws.       

18:13.826 --> 18:15.725
      Abortion! On Sunday!      

18:15.727 --> 18:17.694
    Hey, Arch, she's right.     

18:17.696 --> 18:19.496
    I mean, why should a man    
         have the right         

18:19.498 --> 18:21.698
    to tell a woman what she    
     can do with her body?      

18:21.700 --> 18:23.434
    Get off the woman's body    
          on a Sunday!          

18:25.370 --> 18:27.704
      Talking about things      
like that in this house--       

18:27.706 --> 18:29.473
abortions and all of that.      

18:29.475 --> 18:31.275
    Even the president          
    of the U.S. of A.           

18:31.277 --> 18:33.077
Took time out to say that       
        that was wrong.         

18:33.079 --> 18:35.779
Nixon would soon change his mind
      if he got pregnant.       

18:38.316 --> 18:39.716
    I ain't gonna stay here     
        and listen              

18:39.718 --> 18:41.518
to no more of this here garbage.

  Where are you going, Archie?  

18:45.391 --> 18:47.491
  Down to Kelsey's Bar, Edith,  

18:47.493 --> 18:50.660
where people still have a little
    respect for the Sabbath.    

18:54.265 --> 18:56.266
         And then this guy      
         puts a gun to his head,

18:56.268 --> 18:57.434
        and says to his wife,   

18:57.436 --> 18:59.169
             "Don't laugh, baby,
             you're next."

19:16.255 --> 19:17.254
                    What?       

19:17.256 --> 19:19.256
 I got a great riddle for you.  

19:19.258 --> 19:20.557
 Anybody here good at riddles?  

19:20.559 --> 19:22.759
A riddle? Ol' Barney here       
is an expert on them things.    

19:22.761 --> 19:24.361
              Well, to be honest
              with you, Arch,   

19:24.363 --> 19:26.397
      the riddle ain't been born
      that I can't figure out.  

19:26.399 --> 19:27.597
                That's right.   

19:27.599 --> 19:29.133
    Well, that's good,          
      because here it is,       

19:29.135 --> 19:30.634
      and it's a toughie.       

19:30.636 --> 19:33.570
Now, father and son go out      
    for a drive in the car.     

19:33.572 --> 19:34.671
  All right, there's a crash.   

19:34.673 --> 19:35.672
                        Yeah.   

19:35.674 --> 19:37.341
      The father's killed.      

19:37.343 --> 19:38.942
         Now, they rush         
    the kid to the hospital     

19:38.944 --> 19:41.045
    for emergency operation.    

19:41.047 --> 19:42.513
     The surgeon comes in,      

19:42.515 --> 19:44.114
takes one look at the kid       
        and says,               

19:44.116 --> 19:50.754
    "Hold it, hold it.          
I cannot operate on my own son."

19:50.756 --> 19:52.689
    Now explain that.           

19:52.691 --> 19:55.859
    Boy, that kid was lucky.    

19:55.861 --> 19:58.128

  the nut that operated on me?

      leaving the hospital      

20:06.705 --> 20:08.138
      than when I went in.      

20:10.007 --> 20:12.409
  Get back to the riddle, huh?  

20:12.411 --> 20:14.478
    Why couldn't the surgeon    
      operate on the kid?       

20:14.480 --> 20:16.346
          A pushover.           

20:16.348 --> 20:18.582
        Because the son         
    was a son-in-law.

          The surgeon           
     was the boy's mother!      

22:27.079 --> 22:28.712
You're right!                   

22:28.714 --> 22:31.515
    Oh, good for you,           
    Mrs. Bunker!                

22:31.517 --> 22:33.217
                 Why didn't I   
                 think of that?!

22:33.219 --> 22:36.019
         That's wrong!          
    What's the real answer?     

22:36.021 --> 22:38.255
        That's it.              
        Mrs. Bunker is right.   

22:38.257 --> 22:40.557
         Gee, you know,         
  that never entered my head,   

22:40.559 --> 22:41.958
that a woman could be a surgeon.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.860
        Look at the way         
  I've been trained to think.   

22:43.862 --> 22:44.994
Like a chauvinist.              
                        Right.  

22:44.996 --> 22:46.597
  Well, if that's the answer,   

22:46.599 --> 22:48.064
that's the dumbest riddle       
         I ever heard.          

22:49.634 --> 22:51.568
            I'll tell you what's
            dumb, Mr. Bunker--  

22:51.570 --> 22:53.237
          that we have all been 
          conditioned to believe

22:53.239 --> 22:54.871
                that only men   
                can be surgeons.

22:54.873 --> 22:56.673
                Aw, what are you
                talking about?  

22:56.675 --> 22:58.475
     With all the millions      
    of doctors in the world,    

22:58.477 --> 23:00.277
          who the hell          
 ever heard of a woman surgeon? 

23:00.279 --> 23:02.979
Daddy, there are thousands      
of women surgeons in the world. 

23:02.981 --> 23:04.981
Oh, well, not around here.      

23:04.983 --> 23:06.516
            Maybe in            
    your oriental countries,    

23:06.518 --> 23:10.354
where they got that there       
 chinky-puncture or something.  

23:13.658 --> 23:16.025
        Ma, you were very smart 
        to have thought of that.

23:16.027 --> 23:18.695
Oh, thank you, Mike.            

23:18.697 --> 23:20.830
But I'm sorry I thought of it   

23:20.832 --> 23:22.466
         before you did, Archie.

23:22.468 --> 23:24.834
Aw, who cares, Edith?           
It was a dumb riddle.           

23:24.836 --> 23:26.236
It was made up by a woman,      

23:26.238 --> 23:29.273
    it's got a make-believe     
woman doctor in it there,       

23:29.275 --> 23:30.874
     and I ain't surprised      
        that you got it,        

23:30.876 --> 23:32.909
 because it's a woman's riddle. 

23:32.911 --> 23:34.745
      I don't want to hear      
    no more about it.           

23:34.747 --> 23:36.946
                  And give me   
                  back my cigar.

Oh, my, that was                
a clever riddle                 

23:48.594 --> 23:50.260
Tammy gave us.                  

23:50.262 --> 23:52.862

                riddle for yous.

23:54.933 --> 23:56.700
Oh, good!                       

23:58.035 --> 24:00.537
            How long            
    does it take one dingbat    

24:00.539 --> 24:02.806
  to go 20 feet for one beer?   

24:11.716 --> 24:14.918
    How long does it take...    

24:14.920 --> 24:16.019
                 Oh, never mind!

24:16.021 --> 24:17.487
                  Just go out   
                  to the kitchen

24:17.489 --> 24:19.122
            and bring me back   
            a can of beer.      

24:19.124 --> 24:21.191
Oh. Right away, Archie.         

24:21.193 --> 24:23.327
            How long            
  does it take one dingbat...   

24:36.474 --> 24:39.343
