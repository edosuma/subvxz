00:03.837 --> 00:06.674
[music playing]

00:08.776 --> 00:10.811
I help pick the numbers.

00:10.844 --> 00:13.181
Again.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.316
I help pick the numbers.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.485
Again.

00:17.518 --> 00:20.388
I help pick the numbers.

00:20.421 --> 00:23.591
The more I watch, the
more beautiful she becomes.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.059
I must meet her.

00:25.093 --> 00:28.662
Well, her name is Jackie
Harris, she's divorced,

00:28.696 --> 00:31.865
part owner of a diner, lives
in a small town called Lanford,

00:31.899 --> 00:35.303
and in high school,
she was spirit captain.

00:35.336 --> 00:37.471
Whatever that is.

00:37.505 --> 00:39.740
Lovely.

00:39.773 --> 00:40.908
We are going to Lanford.

00:48.916 --> 00:49.717
Where it is Lanford?

00:51.085 --> 00:54.555
[theme song]

00:54.588 --> 00:59.026
(SINGING) If what doesn't
kill us is making us stronger,

00:59.059 --> 01:04.031
we're gonna last longer than
that greatest wall in China

01:04.064 --> 01:07.034
or that rabbit with the drum.

01:07.067 --> 01:12.005
If there's one thing that
I've learned while waiting

01:12.039 --> 01:16.009
for my turn it's that in
each life some rain falls

01:16.043 --> 01:19.012
but you also get some sun.

01:19.046 --> 01:26.487
And we'll make out better
than OK, hear what I say.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.422
Yeah, any day.

01:45.005 --> 01:46.540
OK, grandma.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.409
Say hi to dad.

01:48.442 --> 01:49.310
Yeah.

01:49.343 --> 01:51.312
I love you, too.

01:51.345 --> 01:53.113
I miss you, too.

01:53.147 --> 01:54.448
Yeah, I really love you, too.

01:57.151 --> 01:59.920
This is DJ.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.390
DJ Conner.

02:02.423 --> 02:04.825
Bye.

02:04.858 --> 02:10.231
Oh God, that's it.

02:10.264 --> 02:11.699
It's it.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.901
Dating, hell, hell, dating.

02:13.934 --> 02:14.802
It's the same.

02:14.835 --> 02:16.204
It's not different.

02:16.237 --> 02:18.572
You know, I thought
that I had been

02:18.606 --> 02:23.477
to the dark side of dating,
Roseanne, but I was wrong.

02:23.511 --> 02:25.813
He whined to me all
night long about

02:25.846 --> 02:29.283
how his ex-wife was trying to
soak every last dime from him.

02:29.317 --> 02:32.486
And then he waited for
me to pick up the check.

02:32.520 --> 02:35.923
So, that makes me
Jackie the Loser Magnet.

02:38.592 --> 02:39.860
Well, now at
least you're going

02:39.893 --> 02:41.662
after guys that are
ambitious enough

02:41.695 --> 02:44.031
to date you for your money.

02:44.064 --> 02:45.866
You don't even know, Roseanne.

02:45.899 --> 02:47.735
You've never had to date.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.770
Oh please, dating's
just like hunting.

02:49.803 --> 02:52.973
You get lucky,
you go home early.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.175
I don't need a man.

02:55.209 --> 02:57.678
I am financially secure.

02:57.711 --> 03:01.882
I am emotionally stable.

03:01.915 --> 03:04.918
I got my Andy, I have my family.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.387
What about sex?

03:06.420 --> 03:09.156
I am so through with that.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.724
I am giving up on
the whole mess.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.426
I'm getting rid of my
short skirts and my heels

03:12.460 --> 03:16.530
and my makeup and my
tweezers and I'm free.

03:16.564 --> 03:18.466
I'm a free woman.

03:18.499 --> 03:19.367
I feel great.

03:24.372 --> 03:27.140
I'm going to go
upstairs and get my son

03:27.174 --> 03:30.077
and we're going to go home
and start our new life.

03:33.113 --> 03:34.382
You want to stay over?

03:34.415 --> 03:35.283
Yeah.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.116
Yeah.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.493
You know, some things
don't change no matter

03:45.526 --> 03:46.927
how much money you've got.

03:46.960 --> 03:50.631
Like, I don't consider
doing the ketchups work.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.333
You see?

03:52.366 --> 03:54.635
It's more like a challenge.

03:54.668 --> 03:57.838
No, it's work, Jackie, and I'm
no longer up to that challenge.

04:10.551 --> 04:13.587
Um, can you help me?

04:13.621 --> 04:17.425
I mean-- I mean--

04:17.458 --> 04:18.459
can I-- can I--

04:18.492 --> 04:19.360
can you help--

04:19.393 --> 04:20.260
[laughter]

04:20.294 --> 04:22.296
Sorry.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.865
Is there something that
I could get for you?

04:24.898 --> 04:29.703
Um, lunch.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.104
Yes, lunch.

04:31.138 --> 04:33.407
Um, we have no real specials.

04:33.441 --> 04:37.411
But without getting too
personal could I recommend

04:37.445 --> 04:38.946
the double loose meat combo?

04:38.979 --> 04:41.048
It comes with a drink
so that's your best buy.

04:43.751 --> 04:48.822
I don't know what that is
but I'll try it if you say

04:48.856 --> 04:50.290
so, Jackie.

04:50.324 --> 04:52.926
How did you know my name?

04:52.960 --> 04:56.330
I saw you on television
and I had to meet you.

04:56.364 --> 04:58.231
Oh really?

04:58.265 --> 05:00.200
I'm Carlos Charmaine.

05:00.233 --> 05:01.869
I'm from Moldavia.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.136
Oh, Moldavia.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.906
Oh, I've heard of Moldavia.

05:05.939 --> 05:11.545
I watch that Carmen
Sandiego show.

05:11.579 --> 05:13.547
It's one of my
favorite shows, as well.

05:13.581 --> 05:14.715
Oh, really?

05:14.748 --> 05:17.518
Well what do you do there
in Moldavia, Carlos?

05:17.551 --> 05:22.356
Well, actually, I'm a prince.

05:22.390 --> 05:23.190
A prince?

05:25.959 --> 05:27.828
The Prince of Moldavia.

05:27.861 --> 05:31.131
The Prince of Moldavia.

05:31.164 --> 05:31.965
OK.

05:35.002 --> 05:38.672
I have a Duke and Duchess
waiting on their fries.

05:38.706 --> 05:41.409
And so I will be right back.

05:41.442 --> 05:42.242
OK?

05:46.647 --> 05:50.117
Loser, loser, loser.

05:50.150 --> 05:51.318
See?

05:51.351 --> 05:53.421
This guy is looking really
good and then he goes

05:53.454 --> 05:54.588
and tells me he's a prince.

05:54.622 --> 05:55.523
Can you believe that?

05:55.556 --> 05:57.057
Well, give him
a chance, Jackie.

05:57.090 --> 06:01.361
I mean, if he was a big loser he
would told you he was the king.

06:01.395 --> 06:03.897
Sam, where'd you put the--

06:03.931 --> 06:08.268
oh my God, Prince Carlos.

06:08.301 --> 06:10.003
The only straight man
in the world that can

06:10.037 --> 06:11.004
get away with wearing purple.

06:13.541 --> 06:14.775
What?

06:14.808 --> 06:17.277
Wait a minute, you're telling
me that guy's for real?

06:17.310 --> 06:20.581
- Hello.
- No, that's-- it's not--

06:20.614 --> 06:21.982
it's not possible.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.717
Look, trust me to
point out loyalty

06:23.751 --> 06:25.819
and I will trust you
to point rodeo stars.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.558
He can't be a prince.

06:30.591 --> 06:34.762
He has no scepter
or no entourage.

06:34.795 --> 06:37.164
Except for that double
wide limousine out there

06:37.197 --> 06:39.733
with the little flags
on the antennas.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.935
Oh my God.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.804
My God, he's a prince.

06:43.837 --> 06:46.106
And he came here to see me.

06:46.139 --> 06:47.641
Oh no, what if you're
supposed to be a virgin?

06:53.213 --> 06:55.382
Oh my god I forgot
to get him his water.

07:03.223 --> 07:04.091
Your water.

07:08.562 --> 07:10.464
No, no.

07:10.498 --> 07:13.834
Please, this always happens.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.836
There's no easy way to tell
someone you're a prince.

07:19.640 --> 07:20.908
Cough, cough, cough.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.210
This is my sister.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.779
Roseanne Conner of
the Lanford Connors.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.147
My pleasure.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.717
And may I say that television
does neither of you justice.

07:29.750 --> 07:36.256
Wow, that's so sweet, even
if you are just blowing smoke.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.526
That's Leon Carp.

07:38.559 --> 07:39.927
Mr. Carp.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.262
Hi.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.064
My husband is not
going to believe this.

07:49.336 --> 07:51.138
Jackie, at the risk
of seeming forward,

07:51.171 --> 07:53.240
I would like to ask for the
pleasure of your company

07:53.273 --> 07:54.207
at dinner.

07:54.241 --> 07:55.442
Oh no, that's
not forward at all.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.044
That is-- that's right.

07:57.077 --> 08:00.113
Oh, what she said.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.481
I thought perhaps
we could go to one

08:01.515 --> 08:02.983
of my favorite eating places.

08:03.016 --> 08:05.385
Oh my God, you have a favorite
eating place in Lanford?

08:05.418 --> 08:08.155
We don't.

08:08.188 --> 08:10.323
No, I was thinking
of Manhattan.

08:10.357 --> 08:11.725
Oh Manhattan.

08:14.728 --> 08:17.565
The New York, Manhattan?

08:17.598 --> 08:19.667
We'll take my plane, if
that's all right with you.

08:19.700 --> 08:22.102
Oh, well, I
don't know, Carlos.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.004
What she means is that
she doesn't know you.

08:24.037 --> 08:26.774
So in the tradition of
royalty and the dating game,

08:26.807 --> 08:29.710
I should chaperone.

08:29.743 --> 08:32.512
Well, of course, you're
welcome to join us, I insist.

08:32.546 --> 08:34.748
And bring the rest of
your family, as well.

08:34.782 --> 08:36.016
Whatever makes Jackie happy.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.384
Oh, I think that
makes her happy.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.519
Oh I'm happy.

08:39.553 --> 08:43.123
And I'll get Darlene and David
to watch little Andy and Jerry

08:43.156 --> 08:44.524
and that'll make me happy.

08:44.558 --> 08:45.425
Good.

08:45.458 --> 08:46.760
You guys have fun.

08:46.794 --> 08:50.197
I'll be home sitting in
the tub listening to Moller

08:50.230 --> 08:52.199
and brooding.

08:52.232 --> 08:55.035
Hey, can our cousin
Leon come, too?

08:55.068 --> 08:56.269
Of course, the
more the merrier.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.976
[giggling]

09:05.012 --> 09:07.414
Oh boy.

09:07.447 --> 09:09.349
I'll make the arrangements.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.183
Until tomorrow.

09:35.843 --> 09:38.245
This is, like, right
out of a fairy tale.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.681
Even the commode is exquisite.

09:40.714 --> 09:44.351
It has one of those delightful
old world spritzing devices.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.690
The only thing we're
missing is people riding

09:49.723 --> 09:53.393
in coach to feel superior to.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.396
You know, this pillow
is goose down-filled.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.998
I just want to bite it.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.704
So, what do you
guys want to do

10:03.737 --> 10:05.105
first when we get to New York?

10:05.138 --> 10:06.606
Well, I don't know
about the rest of ya,

10:06.640 --> 10:08.475
but me and Leon are
going down to the village

10:08.508 --> 10:09.342
to get something pierced.

10:16.850 --> 10:19.219
Yeah, and then we'll all head
over to "Saturday Night Live"

10:19.252 --> 10:21.521
and see if they've figured out
when to end their skits yet.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.395
I want to go to
the Cotton Club,

10:28.428 --> 10:31.231
sing a hot jazz tune with
the boys in the band,

10:31.264 --> 10:34.267
be part of a Harlem Renaissance.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.603
We'll drop you off.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.905
[gasp]

10:37.938 --> 10:39.707
Oh my God.

10:39.740 --> 10:43.210
Oh my God, Carlos.

10:43.243 --> 10:48.115
oh-- I-- oh, I will definitely
get this dry cleaned.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.616
Oh that is gorgeous.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.919
Thank you so much.

10:51.952 --> 10:54.187
Well, New York gets rather
chilly this time of year.

10:54.221 --> 10:57.157
And it matches
perfectly what I have on.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.458
I bought several of them.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.995
I picked that one out when
I saw what you were wearing.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.096
They're all for you.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.833
Oh, I don't know what to say.

11:05.866 --> 11:09.669
Carlos, I know that you
only saw me on television

11:09.703 --> 11:11.038
for eight seconds.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.306
And I have been
told that I do make

11:13.340 --> 11:16.977
a very strong first impression,
especially on a dress.

11:17.010 --> 11:20.881
But what exactly was it.

11:20.914 --> 11:25.152
You see,ed so real, your
look, your smile, the way

11:25.185 --> 11:28.221
your hair touches your eyelash.

11:28.255 --> 11:34.227
And your voice, when I heard
your voice, I had to find you.

11:34.261 --> 11:36.296
I helped pick the numbers.

11:36.329 --> 11:40.768
Oh, you do a good me.

11:40.801 --> 11:45.172
Now scoot it on
over there, prince.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.975
Wow, this is incredible.

11:48.008 --> 11:49.810
So give me the dirt
on your family.

11:49.843 --> 11:50.710
What is it?

11:50.744 --> 11:53.947
Adultery, alcoholism, bleeders?

11:53.981 --> 11:55.615
Roseanne.

11:55.648 --> 11:57.918
Isn't she fun?

11:57.951 --> 11:59.987
Well, actually, if you
wouldn't find it too boring,

12:00.020 --> 12:01.321
I have some home movies.

12:01.354 --> 12:02.155
Oh, great.

12:07.494 --> 12:10.030
Here's some of
the royal family.

12:10.063 --> 12:10.864
That's the Queen Mother.

12:14.434 --> 12:15.235
Oh, sweet.

12:18.005 --> 12:22.843
Well now, is she the queen
or the mother of the queen?

12:22.876 --> 12:25.445
We've been trying to figure
that out for centuries.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.214
We just sort of let
them both sit there.

12:29.950 --> 12:34.754
Here's the coronation of
my father, King Carlos IX.

12:34.788 --> 12:35.655
Great king.

12:35.688 --> 12:36.890
He died a few years ago.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.025
Oh, I'm so sorry.

12:38.058 --> 12:38.859
Was he beheaded?

12:43.563 --> 12:48.201
Well now, if the king died,
why aren't you the king?

12:48.235 --> 12:51.805
In my country, the queen
rules after the king's death.

12:51.839 --> 12:52.672
Viva Moldavia.

12:56.176 --> 12:59.012
Here's my aunt,
Princess Marguerite.

12:59.046 --> 13:01.849
She has a great personality,
makes all of her own clothes,

13:01.882 --> 13:04.852
and just loves horses.

13:04.885 --> 13:08.221
Well, she's not exactly
postage stamp material,

13:08.255 --> 13:11.391
now is she?

13:11.424 --> 13:13.293
Look at the parade.

13:13.326 --> 13:16.363
So, is this some big
national holiday?

13:16.396 --> 13:18.598
No, that's when I got
an A on my report card.

13:21.935 --> 13:26.773
Oh, here's the wedding of my
brother to Francis Berguson.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.209
We called her Bergi.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.611
[inaudible] It was
a beautiful affair.

13:31.644 --> 13:34.114
We had Sir George
Shulty conducting

13:34.147 --> 13:35.949
the National Orchestra.

13:35.983 --> 13:41.021
Dan and I had the
Balinda Zelinsky Five.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.355
PILOT: We're
approaching the airport.

13:42.389 --> 13:43.991
Everyone please
return to your seats

13:44.024 --> 13:47.394
and fasten your seat belts.

13:47.427 --> 13:51.098
Look, Jackie, New York
City is lit up just for you.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.000
You know what?

13:53.033 --> 13:56.369
I'm so happy I
almost believe that.

13:56.403 --> 13:58.305
I say we buzz the
Statue of Liberty.

14:13.887 --> 14:17.824
God, this is so beautiful,
I just can't believe it.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.092
How much did this cost?

14:19.126 --> 14:20.860
Don't answer her.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.595
I don't mind.

14:22.629 --> 14:23.430
Seven noroms.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.702
You guys, the
Empire State Building.

14:29.736 --> 14:30.904
Whoa.

14:30.938 --> 14:32.639
I read that if you drop a
marshmallow off the top,

14:32.672 --> 14:35.275
you could kill someone.

14:35.308 --> 14:38.478
Man, what a brutal way to go.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.647
Excuse me, sweetheart,
I'm with the prince.

14:40.680 --> 14:41.514
I'd like a gin and tonic.

14:44.918 --> 14:46.886
They're playing our song.

14:46.920 --> 14:51.424
Oh, we have a song.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.859
Shall we dance?

14:52.892 --> 14:53.726
Thank you.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.398
Thank heaven, I've been
dying to tell you what

14:58.431 --> 15:00.934
I heard in the powder room.

15:00.968 --> 15:05.472
Well, I hope it wasn't hey,
lady, you're in the men's room.

15:05.505 --> 15:06.873
No.

15:06.906 --> 15:11.178
I heard that a certain prince
has a questionable reputation.

15:11.211 --> 15:13.380
He's been linked with
everyone from Princess

15:13.413 --> 15:16.950
Stephanie to Markie Post.

15:16.984 --> 15:17.985
So what?

15:18.018 --> 15:19.352
Jackie's been
linked with everyone

15:19.386 --> 15:21.621
from the meter man
to that photographer

15:21.654 --> 15:22.622
just passing through town.

15:22.655 --> 15:25.092
What's the difference?

15:25.125 --> 15:28.695
Roseanne, I know I'm about to
violate the entire foundation

15:28.728 --> 15:30.097
of our six year relationship.

15:30.130 --> 15:33.100
But dance with me?

15:33.133 --> 15:37.370
Oh Leon, I hoped
you never ask.

15:37.404 --> 15:39.172
Come on, Roseanne,
if you have a good time

15:39.206 --> 15:41.141
you can blame it
on the champagne.

15:41.174 --> 15:42.342
Fine, I'll do it.

15:42.375 --> 15:46.246
Just keep moving your
feet and don't look at me.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.481
The prince is
just a regular guy.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.950
Kind of needy, he
leans on me a lot.

15:50.984 --> 15:56.756
Oh DJ, how about dancing with
your poor lonesome old grandma?

15:56.789 --> 15:59.626
Nice timing, grandma.

15:59.659 --> 16:03.163
Now listen, if an interested
gentleman should come in,

16:03.196 --> 16:07.367
you just cha cha
cha away, all right?

16:07.400 --> 16:11.138
You know one fun thing
about being a prince?

16:11.171 --> 16:15.242
If I start to dance faster,
the band will keep up with me.

16:15.275 --> 16:16.676
Oh really?

16:16.709 --> 16:17.510
Watch.

16:22.515 --> 16:23.916
Now's my chance.

16:31.491 --> 16:34.061
Oh Roseanne, I
don't know what it is.

16:34.094 --> 16:37.864
I can't explain the feeling
but I think I'm in love.

16:40.133 --> 16:40.933
Kill me.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.577
New York.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.345
Just like I pictured it.

16:52.379 --> 16:55.215
Skyscrapers and everything.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.584
Hey, who do you like in that
fight between the cabbie

16:57.617 --> 17:00.187
and the screaming transvestite?

17:00.220 --> 17:02.522
Man, Central Park is awesome.

17:02.555 --> 17:03.890
You know, now that
we have the money,

17:03.923 --> 17:05.225
we should build a house here.

17:05.258 --> 17:07.994
Oh yeah, what the New York
City skyline really needs

17:08.027 --> 17:13.500
is an aluminum sided tract
home with a satellite dish.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.602
Don't wave, Becky, this
town is full of grifters

17:15.635 --> 17:19.172
and confidence men.

17:19.206 --> 17:22.609
[whistle]

17:27.680 --> 17:30.550
Well, if that wasn't just
about the coolest thing

17:30.583 --> 17:33.820
I've ever seen.

17:33.853 --> 17:35.122
Your carriage, my lady.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.022
Thank you, my sir.

17:36.055 --> 17:36.923
Shotgun.

17:36.956 --> 17:38.091
Wait, I got shotgun.

17:38.125 --> 17:40.860
I wanna sit in the
middle like Audrey Hepburn

17:40.893 --> 17:41.828
in "Breakfast at Tiffany's".

17:41.861 --> 17:43.163
You know, oddly
enough, this smells

17:43.196 --> 17:45.898
better than a regular cab.

17:45.932 --> 17:47.367
DJ, get in the back.

17:47.400 --> 17:51.171
I want to sit in the front so
I can do tricks with the whip.

17:51.204 --> 17:54.107
Roseanne, may I
have a word with you.

17:54.141 --> 17:55.642
Yes, of course, Carlos.

17:55.675 --> 17:59.146
But, I mean, it was only an
ashtray and there was a million

17:59.179 --> 17:59.946
of them lying around.

18:07.687 --> 18:10.123
Roseanne, I think you know
the great affection I have

18:10.157 --> 18:11.858
for you and your entire family.

18:11.891 --> 18:15.828
Oh, well, we think you
are one hell of a prince.

18:15.862 --> 18:20.167
It's just that I wanted
to ride alone with Jackie.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.569
She really likes you.

18:22.602 --> 18:25.438
And I really like her.

18:25.472 --> 18:26.973
Well, how are we
supposed to know

18:27.006 --> 18:28.675
for sure that this
isn't just another one

18:28.708 --> 18:31.411
of your royal flings?

18:31.444 --> 18:33.079
Roseanne, if all
I wanted was to have

18:33.112 --> 18:35.215
a fling with your sister,
do you think I would have

18:35.248 --> 18:37.850
invited your entire family?

18:37.884 --> 18:38.951
[bells ringing]

18:38.985 --> 18:41.354
(SINGING) Bang bang
bang went the trolley,

18:41.388 --> 18:43.690
ring ring ring went the bell.

18:47.594 --> 18:50.397
Well, you do have a
point there, Carlos.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.799
And I'll tell you what, I
don't care if you're a prince

18:52.832 --> 18:55.468
or whatever you are as long
as you are decent to my sister

18:55.502 --> 18:57.036
because she's the
only one I've got

18:57.069 --> 18:59.239
and she's been through enough.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.940
You have my word.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.976
My royal word.

19:04.010 --> 19:10.350
Everybody out of the cab, this
one's for Jackie and Carlos.

19:10.383 --> 19:15.922
[inaudible]

19:15.955 --> 19:17.790
Come on, mother.

19:17.824 --> 19:18.725
Shall we?

19:18.758 --> 19:21.694
Let's shall.

19:21.728 --> 19:24.564
You know, Carlos, these
kind of perfect days

19:24.597 --> 19:25.965
don't usually happen to me.

19:25.998 --> 19:29.336
Or any kind of perfect
day, as a matter of fact.

19:29.369 --> 19:33.139
Jackie, words can't express
the effect you've had on me.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.941
I feel as though I've
known you my entire life.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.949
[inaudible]

19:42.982 --> 19:44.817
God, I love this town.

19:55.262 --> 19:56.128
[applause]

19:56.162 --> 19:59.532
Thank you, thank you.

19:59.566 --> 20:03.670
Thank you, it's great to be
back home in the Cotton Club.

20:07.607 --> 20:13.246
This next number is for all of
you who have lived the blues,

20:13.280 --> 20:16.616
like I have.

20:16.649 --> 20:21.354
Johnny, give me a D-minor
and lay it down slow.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.323
[playing piano]

20:23.356 --> 20:24.324
MALE SPEAKER: Sing it, mama.

20:24.357 --> 20:29.762
Sing it [inaudible] damn.

20:29.796 --> 20:36.235
(SINGING) I don't know
why but I'm feeling so sad.

20:36.269 --> 20:39.138
[applause]

20:40.707 --> 20:48.348
I never had, never
had no kissing.

20:48.381 --> 20:52.385
Oh, what I've been missing.

20:52.419 --> 21:06.499
[inaudible] I heard it said
that the thrill of romance

21:06.533 --> 21:10.637
can be like a heavenly dream.

21:15.207 --> 21:21.714
I go to bed with a prayer
that you'll make love to me.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.819
Strange as it seems.

21:30.523 --> 21:33.760
[music playing]
