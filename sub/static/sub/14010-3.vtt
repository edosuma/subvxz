00:03.012 --> 00:04.812
<i>Previously on</i> Damages...

00:04.814 --> 00:06.580
McCLAREN: I didn't
know Naomi Walling.

00:06.782 --> 00:09.116
She contacted my organization
as a whistleblower.

00:09.118 --> 00:13.420
I don't know how her personal
correspondence made its way into the leak.

00:13.422 --> 00:14.421
Every life lost is a tragedy.

00:14.423 --> 00:16.723
PARSONS: Ms. Hewes cannot
prove that my client had any

00:16.725 --> 00:19.059
reasons to expose
Ms. Walling's personal life.

00:19.061 --> 00:22.930
HEWES: I filed a wrongful death
suit against Mr. McClaren.

00:22.932 --> 00:25.532
The first thing that we're gonna
need to do is find out if your

00:25.534 --> 00:28.702
mother had a personal
relationship with Mr. McClaren.

00:28.704 --> 00:32.171
SIMON: This scandal has given
many of our donors pause.

00:32.174 --> 00:33.173
We have a cash flow problem.

00:33.175 --> 00:35.175
HEWES: So you're
looking for a job.

00:35.177 --> 00:38.178
FRANKLIN: Actually, an old friend of
yours has already offered me one.

00:38.180 --> 00:40.180
So how about you double
the girl's offer?

00:40.182 --> 00:43.283
I figure that's a fair price to
keep someone from your past from

00:43.285 --> 00:44.585
working for the other side.

00:44.587 --> 00:46.220
She offered me a job.

00:46.222 --> 00:48.755
You were right, she does not
want me to work for you.

00:48.757 --> 00:49.656
PARSONS: Naomi Walling.

00:49.658 --> 00:52.326
She rented a room the night
before the leak went public.

00:52.328 --> 00:53.160
That's him.

00:53.162 --> 00:54.862
PARSONS: - Who?
- McClaren.

00:54.864 --> 00:56.964
He definitely met with
Walling before she died.

00:56.966 --> 00:58.198
Told you he was interesting.

00:58.200 --> 01:00.267
PARSONS: He's also a liar.

(elevator bell dings)

02:14.076 --> 02:16.076
FRANKLIN: You'll have
a lot of work to do.

02:16.078 --> 02:19.713
PARSONS: Well, I won't
have any work to do.

02:19.715 --> 02:21.648
PARSONS: If I lose
this round...

02:21.650 --> 02:22.582
(elevator bell dings)

02:22.584 --> 02:25.919
the fight's over.

02:25.921 --> 02:30.724
My client will fire me, I'll be
out of a job, and so will you.

02:30.726 --> 02:31.858
(elevator bell dings)

02:31.860 --> 02:34.327
FRANKLIN: Oh.

02:36.297 --> 02:38.231
You better win, then.

02:38.233 --> 02:41.701
(elevator bell dings)

02:41.703 --> 02:43.303
HUANG: Ms. Parsons,
Ms. Franklin.

02:43.305 --> 02:45.005
They're ready for you
in the conference room.

02:45.007 --> 02:47.707
This way.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.910
PARSONS: Here we go.

02:54.589 --> 02:56.316
FRANKLIN: I wanted to thank
you for your offer, but I've

02:56.318 --> 02:58.919
decided to accept another job.

02:58.921 --> 03:01.922
HEWES: Need I ask whom
you've decided to work for?

03:01.924 --> 03:05.225
FRANKLIN: Oh, I don't think
my answer will surprise you.

03:05.227 --> 03:08.061
HEWES: Well, I wish
you the best of luck.

03:08.063 --> 03:10.664
Enjoy your return to the law.

03:10.666 --> 03:13.934
FRANKLIN: It's good to be back.

03:27.682 --> 03:29.716
NOVAK: Hey, there.

03:31.786 --> 03:34.220
McCLAREN: Thanks
for coming back.

03:34.222 --> 03:36.056
NOVAK: All you had
to do was ask.

03:36.058 --> 03:38.625
You know that.

03:38.627 --> 03:40.627
McCLAREN: I hired
everyone back, actually.

03:40.629 --> 03:42.395
NOVAK: Good.

03:42.397 --> 03:46.099
Because we're all in this
for one reason, you.

03:46.101 --> 03:48.735
And if you stop trusting
us, you'll have no one.

03:48.737 --> 03:51.805
McCLAREN: I know.

03:55.943 --> 03:59.512
NOVAK: I got you something.

03:59.514 --> 04:03.383
Found it in one of those
airport boutiques.

04:03.385 --> 04:05.285
McCLAREN: Very nice.

04:05.287 --> 04:06.286
Thank you.

04:06.288 --> 04:09.789
NOVAK: I'm not endorsing your habit, but...
I don't see you

04:09.791 --> 04:11.458
using your old one anymore.

04:11.460 --> 04:13.259
McCLAREN: I misplaced it.

04:13.261 --> 04:15.295
NOVAK: Why doesn't
that surprise me?

04:15.297 --> 04:18.765
It's probably back in
Brussels somewhere.

04:22.635 --> 04:24.373
PARSONS: - Just in the conference room.
- All right.

04:24.618 --> 04:25.585
FRANKLIN: Hi.

04:25.730 --> 04:26.611
PARSONS: - Hi. Sorry.
FRANKLIN: - Sorry.

04:27.117 --> 04:28.742
PARSONS: Just in the
conference room, as well. Thank you.

04:28.744 --> 04:29.743
Welcome.

04:29.745 --> 04:30.744
Follow me.

04:30.746 --> 04:33.413
FRANKLIN: Thank you.

04:33.415 --> 04:34.881
Wow.

04:34.883 --> 04:36.282
Looks nice.

04:36.284 --> 04:37.717
PARSONS: It's getting there.

04:37.719 --> 04:42.922
So...
I thought I'd put you in here.

04:42.924 --> 04:45.925
FRANKLIN: Perfect.

04:45.927 --> 04:47.327
My Lord.

04:47.329 --> 04:50.096
I didn't realize there
would be so much stuff.

04:50.098 --> 04:51.264
PARSONS: This is everything.

04:51.266 --> 04:54.200
Including all of Naomi
Walling's personal e-mails.

04:54.202 --> 04:56.202
Why don't you get
yourself settled.

04:56.204 --> 04:57.971
I have a meeting with
McClaren's people at 11:00.

04:57.973 --> 05:00.440
FRANKLIN: Oh, do you
want me to sit in?

05:00.442 --> 05:05.545
PARSONS: No, I'd like you to stay
here and go through the leak.

05:05.547 --> 05:06.546
FRANKLIN: All of it?

05:06.548 --> 05:07.681
PARSONS: Please.

05:07.683 --> 05:11.651
Code it and pull everything bearing
on Rachel Walling's case against us.

05:11.653 --> 05:13.019
FRANKLIN: Busy work.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.454
I get it.

05:14.456 --> 05:17.023
PARSONS: You get what?

05:17.025 --> 05:19.693
FRANKLIN: You don't want
me meeting the clients.

05:19.695 --> 05:23.096
And I understand that.

05:23.098 --> 05:23.963
(sighs)

05:23.965 --> 05:28.501
You hired me to keep me away from Patty
Hewes, and you don't trust me yet.

05:28.503 --> 05:30.503
I don't blame you.

05:30.505 --> 05:33.907
PARSONS: I also hired you because
you've been up against her in court.

05:33.909 --> 05:36.409
FRANKLIN: You read
my case history.

05:36.411 --> 05:38.411
PARSONS: Of course.

05:38.413 --> 05:41.681
FRANKLIN: I only faced
her once-- 1987.

05:41.683 --> 05:44.451
It was a small domestic case.

05:44.453 --> 05:46.519
PARSONS: It took guts.

05:50.925 --> 05:54.661
NOVAK: So Rutger tells me some hacker
has more information on Princefield?

05:54.663 --> 05:55.395
McCLAREN: Yeah.

05:55.397 --> 05:57.130
But he wants us to pay for it.

05:57.132 --> 05:59.132
NOVAK: What did you say?

05:59.134 --> 06:02.602
McCLAREN: I told him I
don't pay for information.

06:02.604 --> 06:05.038
NOVAK: So we'll just have
to find it ourselves.

06:05.040 --> 06:06.606
McCLAREN: Working on it.

06:06.608 --> 06:09.008
But first, I have to
deal with the lawsuit.

06:09.010 --> 06:13.046
Uh, Ellen Parsons is
coming over to talk to me.

06:20.221 --> 06:22.255
(video game sound effects)

06:36.003 --> 06:38.071
Namaste, you bitches.

06:47.681 --> 06:49.649
PARSONS: In order for the
standard of wrongful death to

06:49.651 --> 06:52.285
apply, the plaintiff has to
prove that you harmed Naomi

06:52.287 --> 06:56.189
Walling intentionally, that you leaked
her personal information with malice.

06:56.191 --> 06:57.524
McCLAREN: I understand.

06:57.526 --> 07:00.093
PARSONS: At the online symposium,
you stated publicly

07:00.095 --> 07:01.561
that you'd never even met her.

07:01.563 --> 07:03.897
McCLAREN: That's right.

07:03.899 --> 07:07.100
PARSONS: So, did you?

07:07.102 --> 07:08.268
McCLAREN: Did I what?

07:08.270 --> 07:11.137
PARSONS: Ever meet
Naomi Walling?

07:11.139 --> 07:12.105
McCLAREN: Never.

07:12.107 --> 07:14.174
PARSONS: You can state
unconditionally that you never

07:14.176 --> 07:16.242
made personal contact
with Naomi Walling?

07:16.244 --> 07:20.580
McCLAREN: Yes, I can state
that unconditionally.

07:20.582 --> 07:23.616
PARSONS: Never had occasion to speak
with Naomi Walling in person?

07:23.618 --> 07:25.618
McCLAREN: What's wrong with you?

07:25.620 --> 07:27.887
I just said "never."

07:27.889 --> 07:30.924
PARSONS: Then I need you
to explain this to me.

07:37.798 --> 07:40.500
That's Naomi Walling.

07:44.338 --> 07:45.772
And that's you.

07:45.774 --> 07:47.740
McCLAREN: How did you get this?

07:47.742 --> 07:49.609
PARSONS: Not really the point.

07:49.611 --> 07:53.546
This was filmed in a Manhattan hotel
shortly before Naomi Walling's death.

07:53.548 --> 07:55.315
NOVAK: That's not Channing.

07:55.317 --> 07:56.316
PARSONS: Yeah.

07:56.318 --> 07:58.418
It is.

07:58.420 --> 08:01.421
McCLAREN: Well done.

08:01.423 --> 08:05.058
You nailed me.

08:05.060 --> 08:07.126
Which means you're
having me investigated.

08:07.128 --> 08:08.761
PARSONS: You lied in public.

08:08.763 --> 08:11.397
McCLAREN: See, I told you
she was the right lawyer.

08:11.399 --> 08:13.433
PARSONS: Channing,
you lied in public.

08:13.435 --> 08:15.201
McCLAREN: Yes, I lied.

08:15.203 --> 08:17.337
Naomi Walling and I
met in the city.

08:17.339 --> 08:19.472
SIMON: Jesus Christ, Channing.

08:19.474 --> 08:22.909
How am I supposed to protect you if you
won't even follow our own protocols?

08:22.911 --> 08:24.010
We have a strict policy.

08:24.012 --> 08:26.212
Channing doesn't meet
with whistleblowers.

08:26.214 --> 08:27.113
McCLAREN: But she insisted.

08:27.115 --> 08:29.716
It was a condition of her
turning over the information.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.851
PARSONS: I don't care that you
met with her, I just want to

08:31.853 --> 08:33.385
know why you didn't
tell me about it.

08:33.388 --> 08:35.520
McCLAREN: Because I
protect my sources.

08:35.523 --> 08:38.924
And she didn't want anyone
to know she met with me.

08:38.927 --> 08:43.462
But now that it's out in the
open, I may as well tell you.

08:43.465 --> 08:44.831
We met twice.

08:44.833 --> 08:46.232
The first time was in Rome.

08:46.234 --> 08:47.567
She contacted me.

08:47.569 --> 08:48.635
PARSONS: Why in Rome?

08:48.637 --> 08:51.871
McCLAREN: Because that's
where I was at the time.

08:51.873 --> 08:55.341
PARSONS: So why did you meet
with her again in New York?

08:55.343 --> 08:57.877
McCLAREN: Once she had
evidence against the Fund, we

08:57.879 --> 09:02.348
flew to the States so Rutger could
talk to her and finalize the details.

09:02.350 --> 09:04.250
They met without me.

09:04.252 --> 09:05.618
Protocol.

09:05.620 --> 09:07.120
PARSONS: Is that true?

09:07.122 --> 09:07.887
SIMON: Yes.

09:07.889 --> 09:11.858
She had collected the data, but
by then, she was no longer

09:11.860 --> 09:15.695
certain she wanted to go
through with the leak.

09:15.697 --> 09:17.697
PARSONS: So you contacted her.

09:17.699 --> 09:18.698
McCLAREN: No.

09:18.700 --> 09:19.999
She contacted me again.

09:20.001 --> 09:23.937
She asked me to meet
her at that hotel.

09:27.107 --> 09:28.341
It's good to see you again.

09:28.343 --> 09:30.410
NAOMI: You, too.

09:38.719 --> 09:39.886
McCLAREN: Sorry about this.

09:39.888 --> 09:42.422
I've learned it's
better to be discreet.

09:42.424 --> 09:43.856
NAOMI: Oh, I understand.

09:43.858 --> 09:46.159
Thank you for coming.

09:46.161 --> 09:47.026
Sit.

09:47.028 --> 09:49.062
Do you want a drink
or something?

09:49.064 --> 09:50.530
McCLAREN: No, thanks.

09:50.532 --> 09:51.664
Do you mind if I smoke?

09:51.666 --> 09:53.733
NAOMI: No, go ahead.

09:58.739 --> 10:01.674
I was uncomfortable not
speaking to you directly.

10:01.676 --> 10:03.876
McCLAREN: Well, here I am.

10:08.582 --> 10:10.883
PARSONS: And what
happened there?

10:10.885 --> 10:12.251
McCLAREN: Not much.

10:12.253 --> 10:14.887
(lighter clicks)

10:14.889 --> 10:17.223
Naomi just needed
some reassurance.

10:17.225 --> 10:19.025
NAOMI: Yeah, but if I do
this, what will happen at

10:19.027 --> 10:21.494
Princefield after
the news breaks?

10:21.496 --> 10:24.097
McCLAREN: The SEC will
most likely investigate.

10:24.099 --> 10:30.103
Uh, and your colleagues will naturally
want to know the source of the leak.

10:30.105 --> 10:31.337
But they'll never find out.

10:31.339 --> 10:34.107
NAOMI: You mean the encryption
code Mr. Simon gave me.

10:34.109 --> 10:36.075
McCLAREN: We're the only
ones who can unlock it.

10:36.077 --> 10:39.112
And afterwards, there's no trace of
where the information came from.

10:39.114 --> 10:41.581
NAOMI: And this process--
you oversee it yourself?

10:41.583 --> 10:43.649
McCLAREN: I do.

10:47.621 --> 10:51.891
Naomi, we've done this many
times before, and none of our

10:51.893 --> 10:55.294
sources has ever been
publicly exposed.

10:57.631 --> 11:02.135
Trust me, everything
will be okay.

11:06.740 --> 11:08.441
NAOMI: All right.

11:08.443 --> 11:12.278
You'll get the files tonight.

11:15.282 --> 11:17.717
McCLAREN: I appreciate
what you're doing.

11:17.719 --> 11:22.688
I... I know it's not easy.

11:22.690 --> 11:26.859
This will be the last time
that we see each other.

11:30.330 --> 11:35.668
So, um... good-bye.

11:35.670 --> 11:39.872
PARSONS: So, in the end, she was
willing to provide you with the leak.

11:39.874 --> 11:42.075
McCLAREN: Yes.

11:42.077 --> 11:45.078
PARSONS: And how did her personal
information get included?

11:45.080 --> 11:46.813
NOVAK: Naomi did not
know what she was doing.

11:46.815 --> 11:48.681
She sent us too
much information.

11:48.683 --> 11:50.683
PARSONS: But you didn't
have to post it.

11:50.685 --> 11:52.919
McCLAREN: That was our mistake.

11:52.921 --> 11:56.222
It...
slipped through the cracks.

11:56.224 --> 11:57.457
PARSONS: Okay, fine.

11:57.459 --> 11:59.092
But intent is everything.

11:59.094 --> 12:00.393
You meant no harm.

12:00.395 --> 12:02.395
SIMON: Naomi had agreed
to provide information.

12:02.397 --> 12:04.397
Why would Channing
want to embarrass her?

12:04.399 --> 12:07.900
PARSONS: That's the
center of our defense.

12:07.902 --> 12:11.437
Is there anything Rachel Walling
knows that could hurt you?

12:11.439 --> 12:13.439
McCLAREN: Naomi's daughter?

12:13.441 --> 12:14.440
I don't see how there could be.

12:14.442 --> 12:17.443
PARSONS: Well, she wouldn't be suing you
if she didn't have a story to tell.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.745
SIMON: You look worried.

12:19.747 --> 12:24.183
PARSONS: With no solid evidence, it's going
to be Rachel's word against Channing's.

12:24.185 --> 12:27.820
Rachel is young,
innocent and a victim.

12:27.822 --> 12:29.922
So we're already way behind.

12:29.924 --> 12:31.924
SIMON: So how do you
plan to take the lead?

12:31.926 --> 12:35.328
PARSONS: Before I can have a strategy,
I need all the information.

12:35.330 --> 12:39.398
I have Channing's story.

12:41.568 --> 12:45.905
So now I need to depose
Rachel and get hers.

12:48.075 --> 12:51.110
(dog toy squeaks)

13:04.158 --> 13:05.391
SANCHEZ: Mrs. Parsons?

13:05.393 --> 13:07.760
DENISE: Yes?

13:07.762 --> 13:09.395
SANCHEZ: Long time.

13:09.397 --> 13:11.197
DENISE: Christopher Sanchez!

13:11.199 --> 13:12.865
Oh, my goodness!

13:12.867 --> 13:13.866
SANCHEZ: How you been?

13:13.868 --> 13:15.301
DENISE: Oh, look at you.

13:15.303 --> 13:16.802
I'm terrific!

13:16.804 --> 13:20.540
Last time I saw you, you were in a blue
tuxedo with a great big cloud of ruffles.

13:20.542 --> 13:23.509
SANCHEZ: Oh, you have
no proof of that.

13:23.511 --> 13:24.644
DENISE: You look wonderful.

13:24.646 --> 13:26.345
SANCHEZ: So do you.

13:26.347 --> 13:29.649
DENISE: Ellie told me about what
you went through a few months ago.

13:29.651 --> 13:31.617
I was sorry to hear about it.

13:31.619 --> 13:33.019
SANCHEZ: She was a big help.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.020
DENISE: I'm so glad.

13:34.022 --> 13:36.022
SANCHEZ: You must
be proud of her.

13:36.024 --> 13:37.223
DENISE: I am.

13:37.225 --> 13:39.292
EMIL: Denise.

13:39.294 --> 13:41.294
What are you doing?

13:41.296 --> 13:43.696
DENISE: Oh, I ran into an old
friend of my daughter's.

13:43.698 --> 13:44.764
EMIL: Well, get changed.

13:44.766 --> 13:45.765
Let's go.

13:45.767 --> 13:47.433
DENISE: Well... we're talking.

13:47.435 --> 13:48.434
EMIL: Well, stop talking.

13:48.436 --> 13:50.636
Your shift started
four minutes ago.

13:50.638 --> 13:54.073
Cassidy's waiting
to go on break.

13:54.075 --> 13:55.474
DENISE: I'm sorry, Chris.

13:55.476 --> 13:56.475
He's so rude.

13:56.477 --> 13:58.477
SANCHEZ: That's all
right, Mrs. Parsons.

13:58.479 --> 13:59.478
Sounds like you're needed.

13:59.480 --> 14:01.180
DENISE: Um...
it was great to see you.

14:01.182 --> 14:02.615
SANCHEZ: It was
great to see you.

14:02.617 --> 14:03.616
DENISE: Oh.

14:03.618 --> 14:04.617
Oh, uh, tell your
mom I said hi.

14:04.619 --> 14:05.651
SANCHEZ: I will.

14:05.653 --> 14:06.652
All right, you take care, okay?

14:06.654 --> 14:07.653
DENISE: Okay.

14:07.655 --> 14:08.487
SANCHEZ: Bye.

14:08.489 --> 14:10.556
DENISE: Bye.

14:14.895 --> 14:18.397
PARSONS: I want to start Rachel
Walling's deposition this week.

14:18.399 --> 14:19.398
HEWES: When will it finish?

14:19.400 --> 14:21.400
PARSONS: When I come to
the end of my questions.

14:21.402 --> 14:23.202
HEWES: No.

14:23.204 --> 14:25.171
Nothing open-ended.

14:25.173 --> 14:29.508
I'm concerned about
Rachel's emotional state.

14:29.510 --> 14:32.478
She's still reeling from
her mother's death.

14:32.480 --> 14:33.779
(sniffs)

14:33.781 --> 14:35.114
I'll give you one day.

14:35.116 --> 14:37.283
PARSONS: To cover her
mother's history, their

14:37.285 --> 14:43.589
relationship, the suicide,
the leaks and McClaren?

14:43.591 --> 14:45.558
I want four days.

14:45.560 --> 14:47.193
HEWES: Two days.

14:47.195 --> 14:48.961
But it has to be at my office.

14:48.963 --> 14:50.830
Rachel's comfortable there.

14:50.832 --> 14:52.164
PARSONS: Your office is fine.

14:52.166 --> 14:53.633
Two days isn't enough.

14:53.635 --> 14:54.967
I need three, at least.

14:54.969 --> 14:57.603
HEWES: You'll take two days, or
I'll file a petition with the

14:57.605 --> 15:05.011
court saying that Rachel is too grief
stricken to be deposed at all right now.

15:05.013 --> 15:06.045
PARSONS: Okay.

15:06.047 --> 15:07.947
Two days.

15:07.949 --> 15:08.981
Eight-hour sessions.

15:08.983 --> 15:10.383
HEWES: Four hours.

15:10.385 --> 15:11.717
Rachel's a high school senior.

15:11.719 --> 15:14.854
She's struggling to regain
some sense of normalcy.

15:14.856 --> 15:16.989
She has grief counseling
every afternoon.

15:16.991 --> 15:19.425
PARSONS: If she's stable
enough to file a lawsuit, she

15:19.427 --> 15:21.093
can find the time to be deposed.

15:21.095 --> 15:23.362
Four hours is absurd.

15:23.364 --> 15:26.365
I'll give her seven hours
with two half-hour breaks.

15:26.367 --> 15:30.269
HEWES: Some of us have
other clients, Ellen.

15:30.271 --> 15:32.905
Six hours, two breaks.

15:32.907 --> 15:35.107
PARSONS: Six hours, one break.

15:35.109 --> 15:36.542
HEWES: Done.

15:36.544 --> 15:39.612
(cell phone rings)

15:41.815 --> 15:44.150
HEWES: I hear you've
hired a staff.

15:44.152 --> 15:47.753
PARSONS: One associate.

15:47.755 --> 15:51.457
Your old friend, Kate Franklin.

15:51.459 --> 15:58.030
HEWES: After a 25-year layoff, you
have to wonder if she can still hack it.

15:58.032 --> 15:59.498
PARSONS: I don't know.

15:59.500 --> 16:03.569
She seems to know a lot.

16:05.339 --> 16:11.243
HEWES: You know why this is
my favorite kind of lawsuit?

16:11.245 --> 16:14.814
Because all the facts of
the case are in question.

16:14.816 --> 16:21.087
So if the facts won't win
it or lose it, what will?

16:21.089 --> 16:24.090
PARSONS: One of us.

16:24.092 --> 16:27.693
HEWES: On a nice, big stage.

16:27.695 --> 16:33.165
PARSONS: I'll see you at
the deposition, Patty.

16:39.373 --> 16:42.375
SIMON: Hello.

16:42.377 --> 16:45.678
- So, by way of an update...
- Yes, yes, yes.

16:45.680 --> 16:47.580
Get to it, please.

16:47.582 --> 16:49.849
SIMON: Everything
is proceeding well.

16:49.851 --> 16:51.617
Don't be ridiculous.

16:51.619 --> 16:54.019
Failure is failure.

16:54.021 --> 16:56.622
And this is failure.

16:56.624 --> 17:01.026
SIMON: - Well, call it what you will...
- I just did.

17:01.028 --> 17:02.928
Failure.

17:02.930 --> 17:06.665
Now what happens
with the lawsuit?

17:06.666 --> 17:12.238
SIMON: We have to be prepared for
it to drag on, which means...

17:12.240 --> 17:13.472
More money.

17:13.473 --> 17:16.442
More money, more
money, more money.

17:16.444 --> 17:17.443
You always ask for more money.

17:17.444 --> 17:20.179
SIMON: Well, at the moment, you're
our only source of funding.

17:20.181 --> 17:22.448
As you know, we can't exist
without private donations,

17:22.450 --> 17:26.819
and... now we need money
to pay for the attorney.

17:26.820 --> 17:28.421
Mm-hmm.

17:28.423 --> 17:35.961
This attorney... she's worth it?

17:35.963 --> 17:38.330
She's very young.

17:38.332 --> 17:43.369
And I think...
too attractive to be good.

17:43.371 --> 17:46.572
SIMON: Channing chose her.

17:46.574 --> 17:52.044
That's because Channing
thinks with his penis.

17:52.046 --> 17:54.280
I'm asking, is the
girl any good?

17:54.282 --> 17:55.281
(Simon sighs)

17:55.283 --> 17:57.283
You said this would
be dismissed quickly.

17:57.285 --> 18:00.553
SIMON: Yeah, well, I was wrong.

18:00.555 --> 18:06.058
Can you help with
the funding or not?

18:06.060 --> 18:09.628
I'll see what I can
arrange on short notice.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.630
SIMON: Thank you.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.332
Mr. Simon.

18:13.334 --> 18:18.103
If you wish to accomplish your
goals, you do not do it alone.

18:18.105 --> 18:21.240
Never forget that.

18:21.242 --> 18:24.310
(seagulls cawing)

18:27.380 --> 18:29.849
(music playing loudly)

18:29.851 --> 18:32.051
SANCHEZ: I'm glad you finally
got a chance to get away.

18:32.053 --> 18:33.052
PARSONS: Yeah.

18:33.054 --> 18:34.320
Me, too.

18:34.322 --> 18:38.257
The next two days are
going to be rough.

18:38.259 --> 18:40.993
SANCHEZ: So, how's
the case going?

18:40.995 --> 18:45.064
PARSONS: I have no idea
what the truth is.

18:45.066 --> 18:46.999
McClaren is bizarre.

18:47.001 --> 18:49.235
He lies.

18:49.237 --> 18:50.536
I call him on it.

18:50.538 --> 18:53.272
He admits he's lying,
and then moves on.

18:53.274 --> 18:55.741
Like nothing matters.

18:55.743 --> 18:58.544
I don't know.

18:58.546 --> 18:59.712
How are you?

18:59.714 --> 19:01.447
How's your week been?

19:01.449 --> 19:07.319
It's funny because, uh... you know,
I'm working at V.A. out in Jersey.

19:07.321 --> 19:09.021
I ran into your mom.

19:09.023 --> 19:10.523
PARSONS: Where?

19:10.525 --> 19:13.292
SANCHEZ: At the Hudson
Square pharmacy.

19:13.294 --> 19:15.261
I didn't know she worked there.

19:15.263 --> 19:18.197
PARSONS: She doesn't.

19:18.199 --> 19:21.967
SANCHEZ: The manager
seemed to think she does.

19:21.969 --> 19:23.969
PARSONS (laughing): My mom?

19:23.971 --> 19:27.039
SANCHEZ: Yeah.

19:27.041 --> 19:29.708
PARSONS: That's crazy.

19:29.710 --> 19:33.212
She didn't tell
me she got a job.

19:33.214 --> 19:34.647
(laughs)

19:34.649 --> 19:36.916
SANCHEZ: Why would she
hide that from you?

19:36.918 --> 19:39.318
PARSONS: I don't know.

19:39.320 --> 19:40.452
I don't want to know.

19:40.454 --> 19:42.488
(laughs)

19:42.490 --> 19:44.356
HEWES: Sure I can't get
you something to drink?

19:44.358 --> 19:45.324
RACHEL: No, thanks. Hi.

19:45.326 --> 19:46.025
I'm good.

19:46.027 --> 19:46.892
HEWES: Sit.

19:46.894 --> 19:50.896
RACHEL: All right.

19:50.898 --> 19:54.033
HEWES: So.

19:54.035 --> 20:00.339
The first day of a deposition is
really just a fact-finding mission.

20:00.341 --> 20:05.144
The opposing attorney will ask you
questions to hear your side of the story.

20:05.146 --> 20:08.013
HERNDON: And even more important
than the questions are your answers.

20:08.015 --> 20:09.014
Right?

20:09.016 --> 20:10.149
Now, keep 'em short.

20:10.151 --> 20:13.752
Make sure you answer the questions
asked, but only the questions asked.

20:13.754 --> 20:16.589
If you don't understand the
question, ask her to repeat it.

20:16.591 --> 20:18.691
But don't be a smart-ass.

20:18.693 --> 20:24.997
No sarcasm, no jokes, no...
HEWES: Thank you, Bill.

20:24.999 --> 20:30.035
But your most important
responsibility is very simple,

20:30.037 --> 20:33.105
tell the truth.

20:36.843 --> 20:40.546
What is it?

20:40.548 --> 20:43.282
RACHEL: When you asked me if
my mother had a personal

20:43.284 --> 20:49.822
relationship with McClaren,
I told you they never met.

20:49.824 --> 20:52.191
That wasn't true.

20:52.193 --> 20:54.927
They did meet.

20:54.929 --> 20:57.997
HEWES: Why did you lie to me?

21:01.201 --> 21:03.836
NAOMI: All right, have fun.

21:03.838 --> 21:05.204
RACHEL: Yeah.

21:05.206 --> 21:06.271
Bye.

21:06.273 --> 21:08.040
NAOMI: Bye.

21:08.042 --> 21:10.409
I love you.

21:12.779 --> 21:18.917
RACHEL: I... I was afraid it
would make my mom look worse.

21:18.919 --> 21:22.521
Okay, everyone on TV, they're-they're
only talking about the sex stuff.

21:22.523 --> 21:28.861
Nobody is giving her any credit for
exposing insider trading at Princefield.

21:28.863 --> 21:33.265
My mom told me that
she and McClaren met.

21:33.267 --> 21:36.368
More than once.

21:36.370 --> 21:40.739
HEWES: Are you saying your mother had
a sexual relationship with McClaren?

21:40.741 --> 21:43.542
RACHEL: Yes.

21:43.544 --> 21:47.112
They slept together once,
but it didn't end well.

21:47.114 --> 21:49.248
HEWES: Rachel, are you making
this up because you think it

21:49.250 --> 21:50.883
would be good for our case?

21:50.885 --> 21:55.387
RACHEL: I'm not lying.

21:55.389 --> 21:59.324
HEWES: Okay, then.

21:59.326 --> 22:02.528
We need to hear everything
you know about it.

22:02.530 --> 22:05.130
The story you tell in this
deposition is going to be the

22:05.132 --> 22:08.100
foundation for our whole case.

22:08.102 --> 22:11.804
Do you understand?

22:11.806 --> 22:15.607
RACHEL: Yes.

22:26.553 --> 22:27.686
(phone ringing)

22:27.688 --> 22:29.021
DENISE: Ellen!

22:29.023 --> 22:30.656
PARSONS: Hey, Ma.

22:30.658 --> 22:32.591
Uh, hang on.

22:32.593 --> 22:34.727
Ellen Parsons.

22:37.731 --> 22:39.732
PARSONS: Now's not a good time.

22:39.734 --> 22:43.168
Can I call you when I'm
back in the office?

22:46.072 --> 22:49.208
DENISE: What are you doing here?

22:49.210 --> 22:51.577
PARSONS: You're
working here now?

22:51.579 --> 22:53.846
DENISE: Just for the
past few months.

22:53.848 --> 22:55.247
Who told you?

22:55.249 --> 22:56.615
PARSONS: Chris Sanchez.

22:56.617 --> 22:58.250
DENISE: Oh, yes.

22:58.252 --> 22:59.985
Oh, it was so nice to see him.

22:59.987 --> 23:01.253
Oh, he's so handsome.

23:01.255 --> 23:02.821
I always liked Chris.

23:02.823 --> 23:06.759
- He was so...
PARSONS: - Mom, when did you get a job?

23:06.761 --> 23:07.760
Is everything okay?

23:07.762 --> 23:09.294
DENISE: Oh, yes, fine.

23:09.296 --> 23:10.329
It's fine.

23:10.331 --> 23:12.464
PARSONS: Then why
didn't you tell me?

23:12.466 --> 23:14.500
DENISE: Well, there's
nothing to tell.

23:14.502 --> 23:16.902
I mean, I like having the extra
pocket money with the holidays

23:16.904 --> 23:18.103
coming up and everything.

23:18.105 --> 23:22.407
And, uh, your father and I
thought it was a good plan.

23:24.144 --> 23:25.410
DENISE: Oh, my God, Ellie.

23:25.412 --> 23:28.180
Why do you always have
to assume the worst?

23:28.182 --> 23:29.181
I love it here.

23:29.183 --> 23:30.182
Terrific people.

23:30.184 --> 23:31.350
We spend the whole
day laughing.

23:31.352 --> 23:34.186
And I'm learning a
ton about business.

23:34.188 --> 23:38.857
Truly, I couldn't be happier.

23:38.859 --> 23:39.958
PARSONS: Okay.

23:39.960 --> 23:44.997
DENISE: So, please, I don't
want you to worry about me.

23:44.999 --> 23:47.900
PARSONS: All right, I won't.

23:47.902 --> 23:52.871
- Well, I got to get back to the
office, so, um... - Okay.

23:52.873 --> 23:53.872
PARSONS: So bye, Ma.

23:53.874 --> 23:55.941
DENISE: Bye, sweetie.

24:01.147 --> 24:03.182
PARSONS: I'm glad you're
enjoying yourself.

24:03.184 --> 24:04.683
DENISE: Yeah.

24:16.629 --> 24:17.629
HEWES: Ellen.

24:17.631 --> 24:18.764
PARSONS: Patty.

24:18.766 --> 24:23.802
Ms. Walling, before we go on the
record, I want to tell you how

24:23.804 --> 24:26.071
truly sorry I am for your loss.

24:26.073 --> 24:27.105
RACHEL: Thank you.

24:27.107 --> 24:30.209
PARSONS: Are you
okay to get started?

24:32.612 --> 24:35.113
HEWES: The floor's all yours.

24:42.055 --> 24:44.489
PARSONS: Ms. Walling, to the
best of your knowledge,

24:44.491 --> 24:47.693
what were the circumstances surrounding
your mother's decision to contact

24:47.695 --> 24:49.161
Mr. McClaren's organization?

24:49.163 --> 24:52.998
RACHEL: My mom contacted
Channing McClaren shortly after

24:53.000 --> 24:56.368
she became aware that there was
criminal activity at her job.

24:56.370 --> 24:58.670
PARSONS: You're referring to
alleged insider trading at

24:58.672 --> 24:59.571
Princefield Investments?

24:59.573 --> 25:00.472
RACHEL: Yes.

25:00.474 --> 25:04.676
My mom discovered Fund 23
was making illegal trades.

25:04.678 --> 25:08.247
She was very upset, and she
wanted to expose what she knew.

25:08.249 --> 25:12.184
PARSONS: Did she tell you why she
didn't go through official channels?

25:12.186 --> 25:13.652
Why she didn't go to the SEC?

25:13.654 --> 25:16.188
RACHEL: She said she wanted
to remain anonymous.

25:16.190 --> 25:20.092
She was afraid her career would
be ruined if she went public.

25:20.094 --> 25:22.628
That's why she contacted
Mr. McClaren.

25:22.630 --> 25:25.964
PARSONS: Did she tell you
how she contacted him?

25:25.966 --> 25:28.166
RACHEL: Yes.

25:28.168 --> 25:30.502
My mom was in Rome
for a business trip.

25:30.504 --> 25:34.306
She knew Mr. McClaren was living
in Europe, so she spoke with him.

25:34.308 --> 25:37.242
PARSONS: In person?

25:37.244 --> 25:38.744
RACHEL: Yes.

25:42.282 --> 25:45.250
PARSONS: And were you at
this meeting in Rome?

25:45.252 --> 25:46.718
RACHEL: No.

25:46.720 --> 25:50.856
PARSONS: Then how do you know Mr.
McClaren and your mother met in person?

25:50.858 --> 25:52.557
RACHEL: She told me.

25:52.559 --> 25:55.160
And she told me they
slept together.

25:55.162 --> 25:58.163
PARSONS: Did your mother tell
you if she sought out

25:58.165 --> 26:01.300
Mr. McClaren on her own volition?

26:01.302 --> 26:02.534
RACHEL: What do you mean?

26:02.536 --> 26:05.871
PARSONS: Did anyone force your
mom to meet with Mr. McClaren?

26:05.873 --> 26:07.205
RACHEL: No.

26:07.207 --> 26:13.011
Like I said, Princefield was breaking
the law, and my mom wanted to stop it.

26:13.013 --> 26:15.614
PARSONS: So your mother told you
she voluntarily sought out

26:15.616 --> 26:18.016
Mr. McClaren in Rome in
order to ask for his help?

26:18.018 --> 26:20.152
RACHEL: Yes.

26:20.154 --> 26:22.287
PARSONS: Did Mr. McClaren
agree to help her?

26:22.289 --> 26:23.021
RACHEL: Yes.

26:23.023 --> 26:26.625
He told her to go back to New York
and get records of the crime.

26:26.627 --> 26:28.560
Then they would meet again.

26:28.562 --> 26:30.662
PARSONS: And did that happen?

26:30.664 --> 26:32.064
RACHEL: Yes.

26:32.066 --> 26:34.967
She collected evidence
for several months.

26:34.969 --> 26:39.638
And then they met
again in New York.

26:41.374 --> 26:43.275
PARSONS: Where in New York?

26:43.277 --> 26:46.912
RACHEL: At a hotel.

26:48.915 --> 26:51.216
McCLAREN: It's good
to see you again.

26:51.218 --> 26:53.552
NAOMI: You, too.

26:53.554 --> 26:58.890
PARSONS: So Mr. McClaren showed up
yet again at your mother's request.

26:58.892 --> 27:01.159
RACHEL: I'm not sure who
asked to speak to who.

27:01.161 --> 27:06.965
PARSONS: Did you mother tell you what
happened the second time they met?

27:06.967 --> 27:09.034
RACHEL: Yes.

27:09.036 --> 27:12.104
Mr. McClaren attacked her.

27:12.106 --> 27:14.272
McCLAREN: Sorry about this.

27:14.274 --> 27:16.441
I've learned it's
better to be discreet.

27:16.443 --> 27:17.809
NAOMI: Oh, I understand.

27:17.811 --> 27:19.144
Thank you for coming.

27:19.146 --> 27:20.312
Sit.

27:20.314 --> 27:22.647
Do you want a drink
or something?

27:22.649 --> 27:24.049
McCLAREN: No, thanks.

27:24.051 --> 27:25.417
Do you mind if I smoke?

27:25.419 --> 27:27.686
NAOMI: No, go ahead.

27:32.625 --> 27:35.394
I was uncomfortable not
speaking to you directly.

27:35.396 --> 27:39.064
McCLAREN: Well, here I am.

27:51.044 --> 27:54.079
NAOMI: What will happen at
Princefield after the news breaks?

27:54.081 --> 27:56.948
McCLAREN: The SEC will most
likely investigate, and your

27:56.950 --> 28:00.719
colleagues will naturally want
to know the source of the leak.

28:00.721 --> 28:03.021
But they'll never find out.

28:03.023 --> 28:05.524
NAOMI: The encryption
code Mr. Simon gave me.

28:05.526 --> 28:08.226
McCLAREN: We're the only
ones who can unlock it, and

28:08.228 --> 28:11.229
afterwards, there's no trace of
where the information came from.

28:11.231 --> 28:15.300
NAOMI: And this whole process,
you oversee yourself?

28:15.302 --> 28:18.103
McCLAREN: I do.

28:22.275 --> 28:24.476
So there's nothing
to worry about.

28:24.478 --> 28:25.777
NAOMI: No, please, don't.

28:25.779 --> 28:30.282
Sleeping with you in
Rome was a mistake.

28:30.284 --> 28:38.256
Uh... I'm afraid this is something
I can't follow through on.

28:38.258 --> 28:40.392
McCLAREN: What isn't?

28:40.394 --> 28:41.293
NAOMI: The leak.

28:41.295 --> 28:42.394
I can't do it.

28:42.396 --> 28:43.962
I'm sorry.

28:43.964 --> 28:46.531
McCLAREN: What did you say?

28:46.533 --> 28:48.800
NAOMI: I'm not going to do it.

28:48.802 --> 28:52.404
I just... I have to...
I have to consider my daughter.

28:54.774 --> 28:57.642
PARSONS: So your mother
reported all of this to you?

28:57.644 --> 29:00.345
RACHEL: Yes.

29:02.348 --> 29:04.649
We were very close.

29:04.651 --> 29:06.952
McCLAREN: Why am I here, Naomi?

29:06.954 --> 29:08.253
You already spoke to Rutger.

29:08.255 --> 29:10.155
Why call me?

29:10.157 --> 29:11.756
NAOMI: I just wanted to talk.

29:11.758 --> 29:13.925
McCLAREN: Just stop
dicking me around!

29:13.927 --> 29:18.363
I have waited six months
for this information!

29:21.968 --> 29:23.301
NAOMI: All right.

29:23.303 --> 29:24.669
You need to leave right now.

29:24.671 --> 29:28.140
McCLAREN: You think I
can't take what I want?

29:31.077 --> 29:33.812
Why did you call me, huh?

29:33.814 --> 29:35.547
Why did you call me here?

29:35.549 --> 29:36.548
NAOMI: Stop it.

29:36.550 --> 29:37.549
Stop!

29:37.551 --> 29:39.017
McCLAREN: Just to say no?

29:39.019 --> 29:40.452
I don't think so.

29:40.454 --> 29:41.486
NAOMI: Get off!

29:41.488 --> 29:43.555
McCLAREN: I think this
is what you want.

29:43.557 --> 29:44.556
NAOMI: Get off me!

29:44.558 --> 29:48.960
McCLAREN: If I give you what you
want, will you give me what I want?

29:48.962 --> 29:49.961
Huh?

29:49.963 --> 29:52.597
NAOMI: Get off!

29:54.433 --> 29:57.869
McCLAREN: I'm giving you
a chance to be a hero.

29:57.871 --> 30:01.339
(McClaren grunts)

30:01.341 --> 30:02.407
Oh, fuck!

30:02.409 --> 30:05.177
NAOMI: I swear to God, you get
the fuck out of here right

30:05.179 --> 30:06.811
now or I will call the police.

30:11.250 --> 30:15.487
McCLAREN: That'd be a
big fucking mistake.

30:15.489 --> 30:23.662
If you care about your daughter as
much as you say... don't let me down.

30:25.364 --> 30:28.099
(door opens and closes)

30:34.640 --> 30:37.742
PARSONS: That's quite a
dramatic account, Ms. Walling.

30:37.744 --> 30:38.777
HEWES: Objection.

30:38.779 --> 30:40.178
A question would be helpful.

30:40.180 --> 30:42.948
PARSONS: Ms. Walling, did you
witness the alleged assault you

30:42.950 --> 30:44.416
just described?

30:44.418 --> 30:47.319
RACHEL: No.

30:47.321 --> 30:50.755
PARSONS: And have you ever had occasion
to discover your mother lied to you?

30:50.757 --> 30:52.123
RACHEL: No.

30:52.125 --> 30:54.993
Never.

30:54.995 --> 30:56.027
PARSONS: Impressive.

30:56.029 --> 30:58.697
I don't think most people could
say that about their mothers.

30:58.699 --> 30:59.698
HEWES: Objection.

30:59.700 --> 31:03.435
What's the question?

31:03.437 --> 31:06.371
PARSONS: Isn't it possible that
your mother may have lied

31:06.373 --> 31:10.041
to you about what happened
with Mr. McClaren?

31:10.043 --> 31:12.043
RACHEL: Why would she lie?

31:12.045 --> 31:15.647
The whole reason she went to
Mr. McClaren was to tell the

31:15.649 --> 31:18.083
truth about what she knew.

31:18.085 --> 31:23.355
PARSONS: Isn't it possible that
your mother may have lied to you?

31:23.357 --> 31:24.689
RACHEL: I knew her.

31:24.691 --> 31:29.661
And I could see she was
telling me the truth.

31:29.663 --> 31:32.464
PARSONS: When was the last
time you spoke to your mother?

31:32.466 --> 31:35.900
RACHEL: I was out with friends.

31:35.902 --> 31:39.437
She called to tell
me she loved me.

31:39.439 --> 31:45.477
And, uh...
and that she was doing better.

31:45.479 --> 31:48.513
I told her I loved her.

31:48.515 --> 31:56.554
Then I went home later and...
found her dead.

31:58.424 --> 32:00.659
PARSONS: I'm sorry, Rachel.

32:00.661 --> 32:05.697
Aside from that, do you understand that
everything you said here today is

32:05.699 --> 32:07.766
secondhand knowledge?

32:07.768 --> 32:10.535
There isn't one detail you can
provide about these events

32:10.537 --> 32:12.270
that you yourself witnessed.

32:12.272 --> 32:16.174
Everything you can contribute
to this case-- absolutely all

32:16.176 --> 32:18.276
your testimony--
is simply hearsay.

32:18.278 --> 32:19.678
HEWES: Objection.

32:19.680 --> 32:22.747
Will you please refrain
from bullying my client?

32:22.749 --> 32:25.483
PARSONS: Frankly, I'm surprised
counsel didn't caution you.

32:25.485 --> 32:28.920
Despite your laundry list of accusations,
there's nothing you can prove.

32:28.922 --> 32:31.923
You can't be certain your
mother ever met Mr. McClaren,

32:31.925 --> 32:37.362
because you never
witnessed them together.

32:37.364 --> 32:39.931
Isn't that correct?

32:43.269 --> 32:45.070
Answer the question.

32:45.072 --> 32:48.273
Do you have one shred of
evidence that you can provide

32:48.275 --> 32:53.178
to support any of the claims
you've made here today?

32:53.180 --> 32:54.913
RACHEL: Yes.

32:54.915 --> 32:56.648
I have something.

32:56.650 --> 32:57.816
PARSONS: Well, let me guess.

32:57.818 --> 32:59.984
Your mother gave it to you.

32:59.986 --> 33:03.955
RACHEL: Yes, she did.

33:03.957 --> 33:05.490
(object clatters on table)

33:05.492 --> 33:09.594
But it belongs to Mr. McClaren.

33:10.663 --> 33:12.697
He threw it at her.

33:12.699 --> 33:16.134
Or so my mom said.

33:33.252 --> 33:35.787
HEWES: Any further questions?

33:39.225 --> 33:41.192
McCLAREN: None of that happened.

33:41.194 --> 33:43.194
The girl fabricated
the whole story.

33:43.196 --> 33:44.195
PARSONS: It doesn't matter.

33:44.197 --> 33:46.197
NOVAK: How can the
truth not matter?

33:46.199 --> 33:48.199
PARSONS: What matters is
whose truth plays better.

33:48.201 --> 33:49.267
And hers was quite detailed.

33:49.269 --> 33:51.669
McCLAREN: Lots of things are
detailed that aren't true.

33:51.671 --> 33:54.205
PARSONS: Her level of sexual
detail was quite plausible.

33:54.207 --> 33:56.107
McCLAREN: That's because
you've never had sex with me.

33:56.109 --> 33:57.108
SIMON: Channing.

33:57.110 --> 34:00.111
McCLAREN: What makes that description
of me even remotely credible?

34:00.113 --> 34:01.112
SIMON: I know.

34:01.114 --> 34:03.114
McCLAREN: Let me
be crystal clear.

34:03.116 --> 34:05.183
I met Naomi Walling twice.

34:05.185 --> 34:09.087
And beyond a simple handshake, we
had absolutely no physical contact.

34:09.089 --> 34:10.422
I did not coerce her.

34:10.424 --> 34:12.389
I did not assault her.

34:12.391 --> 34:14.958
Now, I have nothing more
to add to this discussion.

34:14.960 --> 34:15.760
Except that I'm hungry.

34:15.762 --> 34:20.098
I'm going to get
something to eat.

34:26.205 --> 34:28.739
PARSONS: Did Channing ever own
a metal cigarette case with

34:28.742 --> 34:32.010
his name engraved on it?

34:32.012 --> 34:32.877
NOVAK: Yes.

34:32.879 --> 34:34.245
He lost it.

34:34.246 --> 34:37.282
PARSONS: Rachel Walling has it.

34:37.284 --> 34:39.583
She said that he threw it
at her mother in the hotel.

34:39.585 --> 34:41.219
SIMON: Well, she's
a fucking liar.

34:41.221 --> 34:43.087
NOVAK: Is she going to sink us?

34:43.089 --> 34:46.357
PARSONS: I don't know yet.

34:46.359 --> 34:49.527
But I still have one
more day to depose her.

34:49.529 --> 34:51.529
The funds can be arranged.

34:51.531 --> 34:52.964
Your money will
not be an issue.

34:52.966 --> 34:53.965
SIMON: That's very good news.

34:53.967 --> 34:55.099
Thank you.

34:55.101 --> 34:58.970
However, we cannot tolerate
a protracted trial.

34:58.972 --> 35:02.240
If Ellen Parsons can't produce
results quickly, replace her.

35:02.242 --> 35:06.377
SIMON: - Well, I understand, but...
- This is not a debate.

35:06.379 --> 35:07.545
SIMON: Channing wants her.

35:07.547 --> 35:08.880
You know how he can be.

35:08.882 --> 35:11.616
I don't give shits
for how he can be.

35:11.618 --> 35:15.587
If she fails, fire her.

35:15.589 --> 35:17.655
SIMON: I understand.

35:19.959 --> 35:22.694
PARSONS: You were right
about my mom, by the way.

35:22.696 --> 35:24.729
She is working there.

35:24.731 --> 35:28.800
Something's got to
be seriously wrong.

35:28.802 --> 35:32.337
SANCHEZ: Maybe your parents
just need a little extra money.

35:32.339 --> 35:34.372
PARSONS: No.

35:34.374 --> 35:36.007
She's hiding something worse.

35:36.009 --> 35:37.475
I know her.

35:37.477 --> 35:39.344
SANCHEZ: You didn't
ask her what it was?

35:39.346 --> 35:40.044
PARSONS: Nope.

35:40.046 --> 35:43.882
She wanted me to, but for the first
time in my life, I didn't ask.

35:43.884 --> 35:47.485
I don't have time in my life for
another Parsons family drama.

35:47.487 --> 35:48.353
SANCHEZ: Okay.

35:48.355 --> 35:51.589
PARSONS: I'm not going
to let her suck me in.

35:51.591 --> 35:52.957
SANCHEZ: Okay.

35:52.959 --> 35:54.626
PARSONS: I mean, why
should I, you know?

35:54.628 --> 35:56.794
It's enough already.

36:06.805 --> 36:08.840
(quiet clattering)

36:20.753 --> 36:22.787
(quiet clattering continues)

36:40.739 --> 36:41.673
DENISE: Chris?

36:41.675 --> 36:42.840
SANCHEZ: Mrs. Parsons.

36:42.842 --> 36:43.942
DENISE: Oh, I didn't know.

36:43.944 --> 36:44.809
I'm so sorry.

36:44.811 --> 36:46.811
SANCHEZ: No, no,
no, no, it's okay.

36:46.813 --> 36:47.812
Come in, come in.

36:47.814 --> 36:48.813
Are you okay?

36:48.815 --> 36:49.814
DENISE: I'm sorry.

36:49.816 --> 36:50.815
SANCHEZ: No, it's okay.

36:50.817 --> 36:51.816
PARSONS: Mom?

36:51.818 --> 36:53.451
DENISE: I'm-I'm so sorry.

36:53.453 --> 36:55.119
PARSONS: What-what's the matter?

36:55.121 --> 36:55.853
DENISE: I'm sorry.

36:55.855 --> 36:58.389
- I wouldn't have come, but...
PARSONS: - No, no, it's okay.

36:58.391 --> 36:59.357
What-what's wrong?

36:59.359 --> 37:00.425
What do you need?

37:00.427 --> 37:02.026
DENISE: Can I stay with you?

37:02.028 --> 37:04.362
(sobbing softly)

37:04.364 --> 37:05.363
PARSONS: Of course.

37:05.365 --> 37:06.364
Of course.

37:06.366 --> 37:09.267
DENISE: It'll just
be a few days.

37:09.269 --> 37:11.336
(sobbing)

37:13.839 --> 37:15.473
AURORO: Oh, Ms. Hewes.

37:15.475 --> 37:17.909
Did you want to see these?

37:17.911 --> 37:20.044
HEWES: What's that for?

37:20.046 --> 37:22.847
AURORO: It's her
birthday, remember?

37:22.849 --> 37:26.851
I thought Catherine may
enjoy choosing one herself.

37:26.853 --> 37:28.252
HEWES: Oh.

37:28.254 --> 37:30.321
Oh, yes, of course.

37:30.323 --> 37:34.525
Well, whatever Catherine
wants is all right with me.

37:34.527 --> 37:37.495
AURORO: I was thinking Catherine
could celebrate with

37:37.497 --> 37:39.464
her preschool friends
on Saturday.

37:39.466 --> 37:41.866
Happy to make a special
dinner on the night itself.

37:41.868 --> 37:44.035
HEWES: That sounds perfect.

37:44.037 --> 37:46.104
(news playing quietly over TV)

37:55.447 --> 37:57.915
CATHERINE: Go away.

37:57.917 --> 38:00.051
HEWES: Catherine.

38:00.053 --> 38:03.454
You know you're not
supposed to play with this.

38:05.391 --> 38:06.924
(computer chimes)

38:09.294 --> 38:10.628
(computer chimes)

38:20.973 --> 38:23.074
PARSONS: Isn't it possible that
your mother may have lied

38:23.076 --> 38:26.044
to you about what happened
with Mr. McClaren?

38:26.046 --> 38:27.979
RACHEL: Why would she lie?

38:27.981 --> 38:29.414
The whole reason
she went to Mr. McClaren

38:29.416 --> 38:34.519
was to tell the
truth about what she knew.

38:34.521 --> 38:36.721
RACHEL: She called to
tell me she loved me.

38:36.723 --> 38:39.824
I told her I loved her.

38:39.826 --> 38:48.099
And then I went home later and...
found her dead.

38:48.101 --> 38:50.168
(Parsons sighs)

38:57.643 --> 39:01.079
PARSONS: Are you
able to save me?

39:01.081 --> 39:03.314
You find a smoking gun?

39:03.316 --> 39:06.918
FRANKLIN: I'm sorry,
but there isn't one.

39:06.920 --> 39:10.021
I have been through everything.

39:10.023 --> 39:13.357
FRANKLIN: Here's the e-mail
correspondence between Rachel

39:13.359 --> 39:18.229
and Naomi Walling over
the last six months.

39:18.231 --> 39:20.231
PARSONS: Anything
jump out at you?

39:20.233 --> 39:21.232
FRANKLIN: No.

39:21.234 --> 39:22.800
It's just
mother-daughter stuff.

39:22.802 --> 39:24.302
They were close.

39:24.304 --> 39:25.703
PARSONS: How close?

39:25.705 --> 39:27.772
FRANKLIN: Very.

39:30.375 --> 39:34.145
And I used the police report to
put together a timeline leading

39:34.147 --> 39:36.180
up to Naomi's suicide.

39:42.121 --> 39:47.024
PARSONS: Rachel is out with
friends, comes home, finds her

39:47.026 --> 39:51.863
mother's naked body
dead in the tub.

39:51.865 --> 39:55.833
FRANKLIN: It's horrible.

39:55.835 --> 39:59.103
PARSONS: But nothing that contradicts
what she said the other day?

39:59.105 --> 40:02.206
FRANKLIN: Nothing I could find.

40:02.208 --> 40:07.345
Um, here are the phone
records from that night.

40:11.717 --> 40:14.852
PARSONS: Hmm, there's
lots of blocked numbers.

40:14.854 --> 40:18.289
Which could be McClaren, but
there's just no way of knowing.

40:18.291 --> 40:19.223
FRANKLIN: I'm sorry.

40:19.225 --> 40:21.359
I wish I could have
found something.

40:21.361 --> 40:22.693
PARSONS: Ah, don't be sorry.

40:22.695 --> 40:24.762
I can't find anything, either.

40:27.032 --> 40:29.367
Why did you circle that call?

40:32.604 --> 40:37.074
FRANKLIN: Oh, it
seemed sad to me.

40:37.076 --> 40:43.281
I just noticed that right before she
killed herself, she made one last call.

40:43.283 --> 40:45.483
PARSONS: To Rachel.

40:45.485 --> 40:48.653
Who was out with friends.

40:48.655 --> 40:51.756
FRANKLIN: Maybe she wanted to
say good-bye to her daughter.

40:58.263 --> 41:00.298
PARSONS: Hmm.

41:05.470 --> 41:08.039
Kate, could you come
in early tomorrow?

41:08.041 --> 41:09.774
FRANKLIN: Sure.

41:09.776 --> 41:11.175
PARSONS: Good.

41:11.177 --> 41:14.679
I'd like you to join
me at the deposition.

41:21.119 --> 41:25.923
SIMON: So I've straightened out our
financial situation for the moment.

41:25.925 --> 41:27.225
Payment for work to date.

41:27.227 --> 41:28.192
PARSONS: Thank you so much.

41:28.194 --> 41:29.594
Please, have a seat.

41:29.596 --> 41:32.997
SIMON: Unfortunately, our donors'
enthusiasm for the cause

41:32.999 --> 41:35.700
has also made them restless.

41:35.702 --> 41:38.836
I've explained how things have
progressed so far, and they

41:38.838 --> 41:42.573
don't have much
confidence in you.

41:42.575 --> 41:45.343
PARSONS: They're not my client.

41:45.345 --> 41:47.445
SIMON: Look, Ms. Parsons,
I like you, I do.

41:47.447 --> 41:48.446
You've won me over.

41:48.448 --> 41:52.016
PARSONS: - But...
SIMON: - But I don't make the decisions.

41:52.018 --> 41:55.119
Without the generosity of our
benefactors, we cease to exist.

41:55.121 --> 41:59.023
Even Channing can't
say no to them.

41:59.025 --> 42:02.426
PARSONS: What are
you telling me?

42:02.428 --> 42:04.462
SIMON: I've been
given a directive.

42:04.464 --> 42:09.066
If this deposition continues to
go south, we'll be forced to

42:09.068 --> 42:10.968
find another attorney.

42:10.970 --> 42:15.139
PARSONS: Mr. Simon, one
deposition does not make a case.

42:20.545 --> 42:23.447
SIMON: I'm afraid it might.

42:29.988 --> 42:32.256
(elevator whirring)

42:32.258 --> 42:34.325
(elevator bell dings)

42:36.728 --> 42:38.095
(elevator bell dings)

42:38.097 --> 42:39.530
FRANKLIN: You all right?

42:39.532 --> 42:41.832
PARSONS: What?

42:41.834 --> 42:43.034
FRANKLIN: Are you all right?

42:43.036 --> 42:46.404
- You seem...
PARSONS: - I'm fine.

42:46.406 --> 42:48.072
(elevator bell dings)

42:48.074 --> 42:54.545
PARSONS: This deposition today-- if it
doesn't go better than last week...

42:54.547 --> 42:56.547
FRANKLIN: You'll have
a lot of work to do.

42:56.549 --> 42:58.282
PARSONS: Well, I won't
have any work to do.

42:58.284 --> 43:01.786
(elevator bell dings)

43:01.788 --> 43:03.788
HUANG: Ms. Parsons,
Ms. Franklin.

43:03.790 --> 43:05.790
They're ready for you
in the conference room.

43:05.792 --> 43:07.959
This way.

43:07.961 --> 43:10.661
PARSONS: Here we go.

43:10.663 --> 43:13.831
PARSONS: As I'm sure you're aware,
several of the e-mails in

43:13.833 --> 43:15.633
the leak were written to you.

43:15.635 --> 43:19.170
It's clear your mother
confided in you, trusted you.

43:19.172 --> 43:20.705
Didn't she?

43:20.707 --> 43:23.374
RACHEL: I told you,
we talked a lot.

43:23.376 --> 43:27.111
We were very open
with each other.

43:27.113 --> 43:29.981
PARSONS: I was also looking at
the phone records from the

43:29.983 --> 43:31.882
day your mother died.

43:31.884 --> 43:35.286
Am I correct, she called
you several times?

43:35.288 --> 43:36.954
RACHEL: Yes.

43:36.956 --> 43:39.590
PARSONS: I'd like to
ask you about a few.

43:39.592 --> 43:42.593
There was a call at 5:07 p.m.

43:42.595 --> 43:44.595
Do you recall that?

43:44.597 --> 43:50.401
RACHEL: A little after 5:00...
I was coming home from choir practice.

43:50.403 --> 43:52.603
Um, I called about dinner.

43:52.605 --> 43:55.840
She was upset and hadn't really
been eating, so I asked if I

43:55.842 --> 43:57.808
could bring something
home for her.

43:57.810 --> 43:58.776
PARSONS: Okay.

43:58.778 --> 44:04.081
And then about a half hour later--
at 5:49 p.m.-- she called you.

44:04.083 --> 44:05.383
Do you remember why?

44:05.385 --> 44:08.386
RACHEL: She wanted me to buy
some newspapers on my way home.

44:08.388 --> 44:12.523
I told her she should stop reading
them, they would only upset her more.

44:12.525 --> 44:14.625
PARSONS: So what did you do?

44:14.627 --> 44:19.163
RACHEL: She wanted me to
buy them anyway, so I did.

44:19.165 --> 44:20.564
PARSONS: I see.

44:20.566 --> 44:24.135
And then she called you again
about 40 minutes later.

44:24.137 --> 44:26.337
Do you remember what
that call was about?

44:26.339 --> 44:28.339
RACHEL: The subway had
taken longer than usual.

44:28.341 --> 44:32.309
She was wondering where I was.

44:32.311 --> 44:33.477
PARSONS: Got it.

44:33.479 --> 44:35.679
Um, let's see.

44:35.681 --> 44:38.616
There's another call I
want to ask you about.

44:38.618 --> 44:43.854
It was later that
night at 11:01 p.m.

44:43.856 --> 44:48.392
Am I correct, that was the last time
you ever talked to your mother?

44:48.394 --> 44:51.562
RACHEL: Yes.

44:51.564 --> 44:53.164
PARSONS: Do you recall
what you were doing?

44:53.166 --> 44:56.467
RACHEL: As I said
before, I was out.

44:56.469 --> 44:59.103
A friend's parents had
just gotten divorced.

44:59.105 --> 45:02.973
So a few of us were
trying to cheer her up.

45:02.975 --> 45:06.477
My mom called to check on me.

45:06.479 --> 45:08.279
HEWES: Are-are we done here?

45:08.281 --> 45:10.281
PARSONS: I still
have 20 minutes.

45:10.283 --> 45:12.283
HEWES: My client is exhausted.

45:12.285 --> 45:13.284
She needs a break.

45:13.286 --> 45:15.052
PARSONS: We only
agreed on one break.

45:15.054 --> 45:19.256
But I can see that Rachel
is tired, so sure.

45:19.258 --> 45:20.958
Let's take five.

45:20.960 --> 45:24.261
HEWES: Are you all right?
- RACHEL: Yeah.

45:32.938 --> 45:34.705
HEWES: Oh, it's a long day.

45:34.707 --> 45:36.140
(chuckles)

45:36.142 --> 45:38.409
How are you holding up?

45:38.411 --> 45:41.545
PARSONS: I'm fine.

45:41.547 --> 45:43.714
HEWES: No, you're not.

45:43.716 --> 45:44.715
(sniffs)

45:44.717 --> 45:45.950
You're fishing in there.

45:45.952 --> 45:50.054
You should be going for the jugular,
not going through phone records.

45:50.056 --> 45:52.223
(sniffs)

45:52.225 --> 45:55.226
Well, don't beat
yourself up, Ellen.

45:55.228 --> 45:59.063
Sometimes the facts just
aren't on your side.

45:59.065 --> 46:02.066
PARSONS: There aren't
any facts in this case.

46:02.068 --> 46:03.734
You said so yourself.

46:03.736 --> 46:08.372
It's just you against me.

46:08.374 --> 46:14.145
HEWES: Well...
you've got 20 minutes.

46:14.147 --> 46:16.213
Good luck.

46:21.419 --> 46:24.455
PARSONS: Thanks for
hanging in there, Rachel.

46:24.457 --> 46:26.991
We're almost done.

46:26.993 --> 46:29.660
Ms. Franklin, can you tell
me when 20 minutes is up?

46:29.662 --> 46:33.030
I don't want to keep Rachel
any longer than I have to.

46:33.032 --> 46:34.031
FRANKLIN: Of course.

46:34.033 --> 46:35.232
PARSONS: Thanks.

46:35.234 --> 46:39.170
I'd like to go back to
that last phone call.

46:39.172 --> 46:42.439
The night your mother
died, you went out?

46:42.441 --> 46:44.842
RACHEL: Yes.

46:44.844 --> 46:47.711
(low chatter)

46:49.014 --> 46:53.217
PARSONS: You said your mother seemed
upset, but you left her alone.

46:53.219 --> 46:54.218
Why?

46:54.220 --> 46:55.219
RACHEL: I told you.

46:55.221 --> 46:59.557
My best friend was having a
tough time, and my mom had my

46:59.559 --> 47:05.596
cell number, so if she
needed anything...

47:07.999 --> 47:11.035
...she could call me.

47:15.707 --> 47:18.742
PARSONS: And she did call you.

47:18.744 --> 47:21.178
To "check on you," you said?

47:21.180 --> 47:23.547
RACHEL: Yes.

47:25.750 --> 47:30.354
PARSONS: And that was the last
time you ever spoke to her, right?

47:30.356 --> 47:31.355
HEWES: Objection.

47:31.357 --> 47:32.256
Asked and answered.

47:32.258 --> 47:36.193
PARSONS: What did she
say when she called?

47:37.896 --> 47:39.697
RACHEL: Mom, hi.

47:39.699 --> 47:42.032
That she loved me.

47:42.034 --> 47:45.369
And I told her I loved her.

47:45.371 --> 47:47.738
PARSONS: You got to
tell her you loved her.

47:47.740 --> 47:49.807
I'm sure that
must be a comfort.

47:51.743 --> 47:53.277
RACHEL: Yeah.

47:53.279 --> 47:58.182
PARSONS: Can you walk me through
that final conversation?

47:58.184 --> 47:59.550
RACHEL: What do you mean?

47:59.552 --> 48:02.753
PARSONS: Well, um, you seem
to have an excellent memory

48:02.755 --> 48:04.888
for conversations
with your mother.

48:04.890 --> 48:08.792
I imagine the very last time you
ever spoke to her must be pretty

48:08.794 --> 48:11.262
clear in your mind.

48:11.264 --> 48:14.999
Am I right?

48:15.001 --> 48:17.401
RACHEL: Yes, I remember it.

48:17.403 --> 48:21.338
PARSONS: How did the
conversation start?

48:27.345 --> 48:28.312
RACHEL: She called.

48:28.314 --> 48:30.314
Hi...

48:30.316 --> 48:33.651
I answered and asked
how she was feeling.

48:33.653 --> 48:35.452
She said she was doing better.

48:35.454 --> 48:38.656
PARSONS: What did you say?

48:38.658 --> 48:42.526
RACHEL: I said... "Good."

48:42.528 --> 48:44.762
Good.

48:44.764 --> 48:49.366
Then she asked when I would be
home, and I said that I wouldn't

48:49.368 --> 48:51.669
be too late.

48:51.671 --> 48:54.238
PARSONS: And then...?

48:54.240 --> 48:56.974
RACHEL: She said not to worry.

48:56.976 --> 48:58.942
She was doing better.

48:58.944 --> 49:03.714
PARSONS: So she said she
was doing better twice?

49:03.716 --> 49:05.582
RACHEL: Yes.

49:05.584 --> 49:07.284
PARSONS: Then what?

49:07.286 --> 49:12.056
RACHEL: Um, well, she said not...
she said not to worry about her.

49:12.058 --> 49:13.257
(sighs)

49:13.259 --> 49:18.128
That I should talk to my friend
and try to cheer her up.

49:18.130 --> 49:22.066
PARSONS: And then what?

49:22.068 --> 49:27.438
RACHEL: I said, "Are you sure?"

49:27.440 --> 49:30.641
And she said, "Yes."

49:30.643 --> 49:34.878
And then I told her
that I loved her.

49:34.880 --> 49:38.182
PARSONS: Is that when she
told you that she loved you?

49:38.184 --> 49:40.484
RACHEL: Yes.

49:40.486 --> 49:46.123
I said that I would
see her soon.

49:46.125 --> 49:51.362
She said good night...
and then I said good night back... and

49:51.364 --> 49:55.332
then she hung up.

49:55.334 --> 49:57.000
PARSONS: And that was it?

49:57.002 --> 49:59.069
She didn't say anything else?

49:59.071 --> 50:00.070
RACHEL: No.

50:00.072 --> 50:01.939
That was all.

50:04.609 --> 50:05.642
PARSONS: Okay, Rachel.

50:05.644 --> 50:08.379
I'm going to read back
the phone call to you.

50:08.381 --> 50:12.483
Stop me if I'm getting
anything wrong, okay?

50:12.485 --> 50:16.353
"Hey, Mom, how
are you feeling?"

50:16.355 --> 50:18.689
"I'm doing better."

50:18.691 --> 50:19.923
"Good."

50:19.925 --> 50:21.725
"When will you be home?"

50:21.727 --> 50:23.660
"Not too late."

50:23.662 --> 50:27.297
"Well, don't worry
about me, Rachel."

50:27.299 --> 50:28.465
"I'm doing better."

50:28.467 --> 50:31.068
"Talk to your friend."

50:31.070 --> 50:34.071
"Try to cheer her up."

50:34.073 --> 50:36.306
"Are you sure, Mom?"

50:36.308 --> 50:38.909
"Yes, I'm sure."

50:38.911 --> 50:41.345
"I love you."

50:41.347 --> 50:45.582
"I love you, too, Rachel."

50:45.584 --> 50:47.117
"I'll see you soon."

50:47.119 --> 50:49.086
"Good night."

50:49.088 --> 50:51.822
"Good night."

50:54.392 --> 50:56.393
Does that sound about right?

50:56.395 --> 50:58.495
RACHEL: Yes.

50:58.497 --> 51:03.300
PARSONS: Ms. Franklin, could you
hand me the phone records, please?

51:10.909 --> 51:14.678
Rachel, do you see the
column with the dates?

51:14.680 --> 51:17.114
And the highlighted
call at the bottom?

51:17.116 --> 51:19.349
RACHEL: Yeah.

51:19.351 --> 51:21.919
PARSONS: That's the call
you just described.

51:21.921 --> 51:26.557
Next to it, you can see how long
the call lasted for according to

51:26.559 --> 51:29.159
the phone company.

51:29.161 --> 51:33.797
What does that say?

51:33.799 --> 51:36.233
RACHEL: Two seconds.

51:36.235 --> 51:40.571
PARSONS: Now, while I was
recounting your version of the

51:40.573 --> 51:45.209
call, Ms. Franklin was timing
it, and according to you, the

51:45.211 --> 51:50.113
conversation would have
lasted at least 25 seconds.

51:50.115 --> 51:52.683
There's no way that you could
have said all of that to each

51:52.685 --> 51:53.650
other, could you?

51:53.652 --> 51:54.651
HEWES: Objection.

51:54.653 --> 51:57.354
The plaintiff does not
accept your timing as fact.

51:57.356 --> 51:59.523
PARSONS: Well, you can
argue that in court.

51:59.525 --> 52:04.461
My question to Rachel is, what
really happened at 11:01 p.m.?

52:04.463 --> 52:10.834
That two-second call went to voice mail,
got disconnected or you ignored it.

52:10.836 --> 52:14.505
What you just recounted is the phone
call that you wished you'd had...

52:14.507 --> 52:15.472
HEWES: Objection!

52:15.474 --> 52:18.842
Speculation.

52:18.844 --> 52:26.683
RACHEL: No... Ms. Parsons...
you're right.

52:26.685 --> 52:31.522
We didn't even speak.

52:31.524 --> 52:34.424
I just missed the call.

52:36.327 --> 52:38.328
Yeah, Mom?

52:38.330 --> 52:40.697
Mom?

52:40.699 --> 52:45.702
I answered, but she...
she'd already hung up.

52:48.006 --> 52:51.775
Okay, it was just my mom.

52:51.777 --> 52:52.809
I'll call her later.

52:52.811 --> 52:54.778
Should we get food?

52:54.780 --> 52:55.779
(sighs)

52:55.781 --> 53:00.117
PARSONS: You didn't call her
back, so you feel guilty...?

53:00.119 --> 53:02.920
So you made up that whole
conversation, didn't you?

53:02.922 --> 53:04.087
HEWES: We're done here.

53:04.089 --> 53:08.292
PARSONS: My 20 minutes aren't up,
and she is required to answer.

53:15.166 --> 53:19.369
RACHEL: Yes, I made it up.

53:19.371 --> 53:22.539
PARSONS: And how do we know
you haven't been lying about

53:22.541 --> 53:26.577
everything you've said throughout
this entire deposition?

53:35.653 --> 53:38.355
You don't have to answer that.

53:40.325 --> 53:41.858
Now we're done.

53:41.860 --> 53:43.927
(papers shuffling)

54:10.121 --> 54:13.423
FRANKLIN: It's been a long time
since I was part of a deposition.

54:13.425 --> 54:15.492
PARSONS: It's also been a
long time since you've been

54:15.494 --> 54:17.761
across the table
from Patty Hewes.

54:17.763 --> 54:24.935
FRANKLIN: Well...
the case back then was a lot different.

54:24.937 --> 54:26.436
For one thing, I lost.

54:26.438 --> 54:29.506
So you've already
got one on me.

54:43.454 --> 54:44.421
(glass shattering)

54:44.423 --> 54:46.423
(objects clattering)

54:46.425 --> 54:48.492
(exasperated sigh)

54:53.064 --> 54:54.031
(Auroro chuckling)

54:54.033 --> 54:55.032
AURORO: Ooh!

54:55.034 --> 54:56.033
HEWES: Mmm.

54:56.035 --> 54:58.035
AURORO: Look what we have
for our special girl.

54:58.037 --> 55:00.837
HEWES: Happy
birthday, Catherine.

55:00.839 --> 55:01.838
(clapping)

55:01.840 --> 55:03.807
Happy birthday.

55:03.809 --> 55:05.642
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

55:05.644 --> 55:07.911
Don't-don't you...
don't you want to make a wish?

55:07.913 --> 55:10.847
CATHERINE: No, thank you.

55:10.849 --> 55:12.916
(intercom buzzing)

55:17.922 --> 55:19.923
HEWES: Yes, Perry?

55:19.925 --> 55:20.924
AURORO: Here we go.

55:20.926 --> 55:21.925
Ah!

55:21.927 --> 55:25.328
HEWES: What, she's here now?

55:25.330 --> 55:26.963
(sighs)

55:26.965 --> 55:28.498
Well, yeah, all right.

55:28.500 --> 55:29.499
Yes, okay.

55:29.501 --> 55:32.569
Yeah, let her...
let her come up.

55:32.571 --> 55:35.605
AURORO: All right,
now, let's see.

55:35.607 --> 55:36.773
What side shall we cut from?

55:36.775 --> 55:37.774
It's so big.

55:37.776 --> 55:40.177
A big piece, huh,
for a big girl?

55:40.179 --> 55:42.746
(elevator bell dings)

55:44.582 --> 55:46.850
FRANKLIN: Hi.

55:46.852 --> 55:48.452
I'm sorry to disturb you.

55:48.454 --> 55:51.855
HEWES: No, not at all.

55:51.857 --> 55:54.958
What can I do for you?

55:54.960 --> 55:56.593
FRANKLIN: Nothing, really.

55:56.595 --> 56:04.067
Uh... you just haven't returned
his messages, and, um...

56:04.069 --> 56:09.272
well, I just thought you should
know that he wants to talk to you.

56:09.274 --> 56:12.676
HEWES: Why would he
possibly want to do that?

56:12.678 --> 56:15.979
FRANKLIN: Because he's dying.

56:21.953 --> 56:24.554
HEWES: Well, thank
you for coming.

56:24.556 --> 56:29.659
It's my granddaughter's
birthday, so got to get back.

56:29.661 --> 56:32.629
(Franklin sighs)

56:32.631 --> 56:35.632
FRANKLIN: Well.

56:35.634 --> 56:37.968
You've been told.

56:40.071 --> 56:41.304
HEWES: Good night, Kate.

56:41.306 --> 56:43.907
FRANKLIN: Good night.
