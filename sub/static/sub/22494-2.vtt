00:37.818 --> 00:40.153
and now the secret origin of

00:40.187 --> 00:43.523
Mo-larr, eternian dentist!

00:43.658 --> 00:45.358
Moe larrstein was just an

00:45.426 --> 00:48.228
Average citizen until, one

00:48.262 --> 00:49.696
Fateful day...

00:50.398 --> 00:54.067
...The day he took his s. A.T.S!

00:55.136 --> 00:56.970
With a math score of 520, the

00:57.038 --> 00:58.872
University of eternia was

00:58.906 --> 01:01.074
Marginally impressed.

01:01.208 --> 01:04.144
Acceptance!

01:04.245 --> 01:06.646
Now there was only one thing

01:06.714 --> 01:09.849
Left to do - apply for a

01:09.884 --> 01:12.852
Student loan!

01:12.920 --> 01:14.454
An unsubsidized loan was

01:14.488 --> 01:16.556
Available at a rate of 6.8%.

01:16.624 --> 01:18.725
But in the most dramatic twist

01:18.793 --> 01:20.627
Yet, moe qualified for a

01:20.661 --> 01:22.696
Subsidized federal loan at a

01:22.763 --> 01:25.231
Rate of 5.6%!

01:25.266 --> 01:27.434
Moe suddenly realized that his

01:27.468 --> 01:29.769
Student loan was tax-deductible.

01:29.804 --> 01:31.871
His deduction could be claimed

01:31.906 --> 01:33.607
Whether or not he itemized said

01:33.641 --> 01:35.508
Deductions, as long as he used

01:35.543 --> 01:37.444
The proceeds from the loans for

01:37.511 --> 01:39.312
Qualified education expenses,

01:39.347 --> 01:41.348
Such as room, board, tuition,

01:41.415 --> 01:43.883
Fees, books, and other supplies.

01:43.951 --> 01:45.785
His deductions were valid, but

01:45.820 --> 01:47.954
Only if he attended classes at

01:47.989 --> 01:50.223
Least part-time in a recognized

01:50.257 --> 01:52.392
And accredited program!

01:52.426 --> 01:54.394
When we return, learn which of

01:54.428 --> 01:56.496
Mo-larr's credits transferred to

01:56.530 --> 01:57.597
His new school.

01:57.665 --> 02:00.333
The answers will shock you.

02:01.936 --> 02:05.305
and I'm also a client.

02:05.339 --> 02:06.740
and now a sneak peek at

02:06.774 --> 02:07.941
"transformers 3."

02:07.975 --> 02:09.042
careful, sam.

02:09.076 --> 02:11.511
If megatron gets the allspark,

02:11.579 --> 02:13.513
He will rule the entire

02:13.547 --> 02:15.315
Universe.

02:15.383 --> 02:17.917
Or it might kill him and then

02:17.952 --> 02:19.686
Possibly raise him from the

02:19.754 --> 02:21.755
Dead.

02:21.789 --> 02:23.189
Frankly, sam, I don't

02:23.257 --> 02:24.991
Know what the allspark does.

02:25.126 --> 02:27.260
starts Friday.

02:27.361 --> 02:28.728
so, after you discarded the

02:28.796 --> 02:29.829
Official massachusetts

02:29.864 --> 02:31.264
Curriculum, what did you teach

02:31.298 --> 02:32.198
Your science class?

02:32.266 --> 02:33.366
well, I simply told my

02:33.434 --> 02:34.834
Students that when you study how

02:34.869 --> 02:36.102
The pieces of our world fit

02:36.137 --> 02:37.370
Together, it's obvious it was

02:37.438 --> 02:38.538
Made by a higher creative

02:38.606 --> 02:39.239
Intelligence.

02:42.510 --> 02:44.010
he's a monster!

02:44.045 --> 02:44.811
no, please!

02:44.845 --> 02:45.979
I don't want this!

02:46.013 --> 02:46.980
Aah!

02:47.014 --> 02:48.882
now rub it in.

02:48.916 --> 02:49.716
Rub it in all over.

02:50.818 --> 02:51.818
oh, yeah.

02:51.886 --> 02:53.186
That's the stuff.

02:53.254 --> 02:55.188
Oh, yeah, I smell it.

02:55.222 --> 02:56.956
I can smell you from here.

02:56.991 --> 02:58.158
Oh, my goodness.

02:58.192 --> 02:59.693
Oh, if I puncture you, you're

02:59.727 --> 03:01.728
Gonna ooze juices.

03:01.796 --> 03:03.263
and now a sneak peek at

03:03.330 --> 03:04.364
"transformers 3."

03:04.432 --> 03:05.632
yo, dude, have you seen my

03:05.700 --> 03:06.232
Teddy bear?

03:06.267 --> 03:07.434
yeah, my mom said it was

03:07.468 --> 03:07.801
Dirty.

03:07.868 --> 03:08.635
She was cleaning it.

03:08.669 --> 03:09.636
dude, I had a bag of

03:09.704 --> 03:10.603
Angel dust in there!

03:10.638 --> 03:11.538
oh, no!

03:12.606 --> 03:13.173
no, mom!

03:13.240 --> 03:14.441

Pumpkin dollars!

03:15.342 --> 03:16.342
mom, mom, mom, mom!

03:16.410 --> 03:18.244
Mom, you are talking crazy.

03:18.312 --> 03:20.880
aaaaaaaaah!

03:20.915 --> 03:22.215

03:22.249 --> 03:24.217

03:26.220 --> 03:28.254
starts Friday.

03:28.355 --> 03:29.956
well, I'd like to do that,

03:29.990 --> 03:31.524
But it's against my religion,

03:31.592 --> 03:32.225
You know.

03:36.063 --> 03:37.964
raaaaah!

03:37.998 --> 03:41.701
Oh! You must be here for the -

03:41.769 --> 03:43.203

Hey, feel free to look around

03:44.672 --> 03:46.773

03:48.476 --> 03:50.477
The -

03:57.518 --> 03:59.853
who dares disturb the slumber

03:59.887 --> 04:01.321
Of the ancients?!

04:01.355 --> 04:03.056
Prepare to be -

04:03.090 --> 04:03.490
Oh!

04:03.557 --> 04:04.591
You want that.

04:04.625 --> 04:05.792
Oh, heavens, yes.

04:05.860 --> 04:06.960
It's all yours.

04:06.994 --> 04:08.428
In fact, if you'd like -

04:08.496 --> 04:09.863
No way!

04:09.897 --> 04:11.698
Tell me you did not just -

04:11.766 --> 04:12.398
Oh, that is -

04:12.466 --> 04:13.833
That's just spiteful is what

04:13.868 --> 04:14.334
That is!

04:14.401 --> 04:15.135
You know what?

04:15.202 --> 04:16.369
you, all right?

04:16.403 --> 04:19.672
Just you!

04:19.740 --> 04:20.640

I can do impressions!

04:24.712 --> 04:25.745
"I am a jew. "

04:25.780 --> 04:26.780
"hey! I'm a cabbie!"

04:26.847 --> 04:28.114
"I'm an angry lady!"

04:28.149 --> 04:30.116
It's wonderful!

04:32.987 --> 04:34.087
I created

04:34.121 --> 04:36.122

much appreciate you letting

05:37.551 --> 05:38.551
Me stay here, son.

05:38.586 --> 05:40.186
I'm sure the bank just had some

05:40.221 --> 05:41.454
Kind of computer snafu.

05:41.488 --> 05:42.622
You know, that happens all the

05:42.690 --> 05:43.089
Time.

05:43.123 --> 05:45.325
I'll be out of here in no time.

05:45.359 --> 05:46.960

Breach the -

05:47.862 --> 05:49.462
adam! Hey, check it out -

05:49.530 --> 05:50.597
Cheese and crackers.

05:50.631 --> 05:51.798
I call 'em "chackers. "

05:51.866 --> 05:53.233
Who wants some chackers?

05:53.267 --> 05:54.100
Oh, the towel.

05:54.168 --> 05:55.902
Well, me and chackers here get a

05:55.936 --> 05:57.337
Little crumby watching my

05:57.371 --> 05:59.505
Stories.

05:59.540 --> 06:00.440
Ah, you guys are working.

06:00.507 --> 06:01.641
I'll be in the den.

06:01.709 --> 06:04.544
I have the power!

06:04.578 --> 06:06.446
but do you have the remote?

06:06.480 --> 06:07.247
Ha ha!

06:07.314 --> 06:08.248
I was just joking.

06:08.315 --> 06:09.716
I thought it'd be, you know...

06:09.783 --> 06:11.184
Anyway, you're busy.

06:14.188 --> 06:15.355
hey, adam!

06:15.389 --> 06:16.990
I can't find discovery channel

06:17.057 --> 06:17.991
For the life of me.

06:18.025 --> 06:18.992
Do we even get that?

06:19.059 --> 06:19.993
It's shark week!

06:20.060 --> 06:20.793
# bum, bum, ba #

06:20.828 --> 06:21.895
Love me some shark week.

06:21.929 --> 06:23.162
Never missed it.

06:23.230 --> 06:23.496
True story.

06:23.530 --> 06:24.530
All right, if you think of the

06:24.598 --> 06:25.899
Channel, give me a little

06:25.933 --> 06:26.266
Shouty-shout.

06:26.333 --> 06:27.667
Back to work.

06:28.802 --> 06:29.869
Sack whack!

06:29.904 --> 06:31.771
I'm sure you'll be happy here,

06:31.805 --> 06:33.506
Dad.

06:33.540 --> 06:35.041
so, this is me placing an

06:35.075 --> 06:36.576
Order for some spicy nachos,

06:36.610 --> 06:38.244
Some guacamole - wouldn't mind

06:38.312 --> 06:39.245
That on the side.

06:39.313 --> 06:40.780
If you don't mind, the mild

06:40.814 --> 06:41.881
Kind, 'cause -

06:41.916 --> 06:43.316
you'll observe "lights out,"

06:43.350 --> 06:44.951
Or I'll knock your lights out.

06:44.985 --> 06:47.387
Take that in.

06:57.298 --> 06:58.431
this might hurt a bit.

06:58.499 --> 06:59.232
I doubt it.

07:01.702 --> 07:03.870
Once I transfer my consciousness

07:03.938 --> 07:05.605
Into a smurf body, I'll

07:05.673 --> 07:07.607
Infiltrate their village and

07:07.675 --> 07:09.008
Destroy them all.

07:09.043 --> 07:09.676
meow?

07:09.710 --> 07:10.743
will I what?

07:10.778 --> 07:11.511
meow?

07:11.578 --> 07:13.212
will I them before I

07:13.280 --> 07:14.047
Eat them?

07:14.114 --> 07:15.114
meow, meow.

07:15.149 --> 07:16.215
oh, cook!

07:16.283 --> 07:17.784
Will I cook them before I eat

07:17.851 --> 07:18.418
Them?

07:19.286 --> 07:21.321
'cause I was like, "oh... "

07:21.388 --> 07:22.956
I mean, you were almost looking

07:23.023 --> 07:24.324
For a new apartment, man.

07:24.391 --> 07:25.959
Seriously.

07:34.635 --> 07:36.202
ah, damn. Lost already.

07:36.904 --> 07:38.204
What is that?!

07:38.238 --> 07:39.572
A wolf?! A fox?!

07:39.606 --> 07:41.040
Some other "party of five"

07:41.108 --> 07:43.943
Actor?!

07:43.978 --> 07:46.579
And it's out of here!

07:48.115 --> 07:49.282
Yes, now, where was I?

07:49.316 --> 07:52.218
Oh, yes, terrified.

07:55.556 --> 07:56.489
I don't know what you're

07:56.557 --> 07:57.190
Blurring out.

07:57.257 --> 07:59.659
Smurfs don't have nipples.

08:01.295 --> 08:02.996
Not arousing.

08:03.030 --> 08:04.731
a new smurf?

08:04.765 --> 08:06.165
Most unusual.

08:06.200 --> 08:07.900
What is your name, outsider?

08:07.935 --> 08:09.369
gargam- garga- uh...

08:09.436 --> 08:10.370
Gargle smurf.

08:10.437 --> 08:11.371
oh, really?

08:11.438 --> 08:13.172
Well, tell me - how did you

08:13.207 --> 08:14.273
Smurf that name?

08:14.341 --> 08:16.109
if you're asking whether I

08:16.143 --> 08:18.077
Will gargle your balls, sir, the

08:18.112 --> 08:19.078
Answer is no.

08:19.113 --> 08:20.113
wha- moi?

08:20.147 --> 08:21.481
That wasn't what I meant at all.

08:21.548 --> 08:22.915
more like closet smurf!

08:22.950 --> 08:24.283
then it's settled.

08:24.318 --> 08:26.252
Gargle smurf must pass our tests

08:26.286 --> 08:27.820
To become a member of our

08:27.855 --> 08:28.521
Village.

08:30.391 --> 08:31.557
And vanity's gay.

08:33.394 --> 08:35.193
"smurf" is not only a noun

08:35.229 --> 08:36.895
But also a verb, adjective,

08:36.929 --> 08:38.364
Adsmurf, and a dangling

08:38.399 --> 08:39.332
Partismurfle.

08:39.366 --> 08:40.366
Now you try.

08:40.400 --> 08:41.801
uh, the smurf...

08:41.835 --> 08:42.534
yes.

08:42.568 --> 08:43.703
...Smurfed...

08:43.736 --> 08:44.537
mm-hmm.

08:44.571 --> 08:46.172
...In a very smurfy...

08:46.240 --> 08:47.640
mm.

08:47.708 --> 08:48.508
...Smurf.

08:48.542 --> 08:49.575
It's like you're not even

08:49.610 --> 08:50.610
Trying!

08:50.677 --> 08:52.512
now you must tame your very

08:52.546 --> 08:53.946
Own smurf-eating bird.

08:53.981 --> 08:55.148
did somebody say

08:55.215 --> 08:56.015
"smurf-eating?"

08:56.050 --> 08:57.050
both: Shut up!

09:00.888 --> 09:04.290
you can do it, gargle!

09:04.324 --> 09:06.926
I smurfed it!

09:06.960 --> 09:09.962
Aah! Aaaaaaaaaaah!

09:09.997 --> 09:12.932
Aaaaaah!

09:12.966 --> 09:15.034
It's trying to feed me to its

09:15.102 --> 09:15.968
Young.

09:18.238 --> 09:20.039
Yeah, you won't get me.

09:21.208 --> 09:22.675
I'm so proud!

09:22.743 --> 09:24.577
Your bird accepted you as one of

09:24.611 --> 09:25.945
Its very own children.

09:26.013 --> 09:27.547
Did you bond with your new

09:27.581 --> 09:29.115
Brothers and sisters?

09:29.183 --> 09:30.316
I sure did.

09:30.350 --> 09:31.651
# chum, yum yum #

09:31.685 --> 09:32.552

09:32.586 --> 09:34.120

09:43.130 --> 09:44.030

09:44.064 --> 09:45.565
I'm gargamel.

09:48.402 --> 09:49.402
Wait, wait!

09:49.470 --> 09:51.037
I see how wrong I was all these

09:51.105 --> 09:51.637
Years!

09:51.672 --> 09:52.805

09:52.840 --> 09:53.739

09:53.807 --> 09:56.175
He ate farmer smurf last year!

09:56.210 --> 09:58.111

09:58.145 --> 10:00.279
Bitter and old, but here, I've

10:00.314 --> 10:02.381
Learned what it means to love.

10:02.449 --> 10:04.817

10:06.186 --> 10:08.654

10:09.756 --> 10:11.557

10:11.625 --> 10:12.825
Death with a pipe!

10:12.893 --> 10:14.627

10:14.661 --> 10:15.561
Great smurf.

10:15.629 --> 10:17.430
smurfette, I finally feel

10:17.464 --> 10:18.464
Like I belong!

10:18.499 --> 10:20.266
No one's ever depende me

10:20.300 --> 10:21.267
Before.

10:33.647 --> 10:34.647

10:34.715 --> 10:36.182
Hey...

10:36.250 --> 10:37.717

10:39.586 --> 10:40.186

10:40.254 --> 10:41.821

10:41.889 --> 10:43.356
Look, I know I messed up, but

10:43.423 --> 10:44.824
You know what they say - a

10:44.858 --> 10:46.325
Man's home is his castle, and,

10:46.360 --> 10:47.727
Uh, well, adam, my castle's

10:47.794 --> 10:49.228
Filled with death and urine.

10:49.263 --> 10:51.063
So, uh, what do you say?

10:51.198 --> 10:52.265
Can dear old dad get his old

10:58.605 --> 10:58.871
Take a hike.

10:58.906 --> 10:59.906
You remember when you fell off

10:59.940 --> 11:01.240
The structure and you had those

11:01.275 --> 11:02.542
Stitches, and - and I ran you

11:02.609 --> 11:03.709
To the hospital?

11:03.777 --> 11:04.343
Hmm?

11:04.411 --> 11:05.511
Okay, guilty.

11:05.546 --> 11:07.246
That was "kramer vs. Kramer,"

11:07.314 --> 11:08.614
But we saw it together.

11:08.682 --> 11:09.715
Okay, let's think about this

11:09.783 --> 11:10.149
One.

11:10.184 --> 11:11.517

Yeah, you're working.
