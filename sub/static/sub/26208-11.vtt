00:02.468 --> 00:04.771
My name is Lena Grisky
and I go to the best
ballet school in the world.

00:04.771 --> 00:06.206
I have a secret.

00:06.206 --> 00:08.141
I'm a time traveler from 1905

00:08.141 --> 00:11.011
and my boyfriend Henri
is doing everything he can
to get me home.

(Lena) Previously... I landed an
amazing part in the mid-season
showcase: pairs with Max!

00:50.283 --> 00:51.518
So I guess
we're working together.

00:51.518 --> 00:52.719
Thea's not happy about it.

00:52.719 --> 00:55.321
I'm Lena's understudy.

00:55.321 --> 00:57.157
But she'll just have to deal.

00:58.959 --> 01:01.394
<i>Oh, and Henri and the Time</i>
Collectors have nearly finished
<i>their own port-a-portal.</i>

01:02.128 --> 01:03.664
Where is what?
The missing piece!

01:03.664 --> 01:05.632
So he can come and get me.

01:12.506 --> 01:15.542
(Lena) I can't believe
it's already
the mid-season show!

01:15.542 --> 01:20.380
There's this ritual that
I used to do, where I'd gather
all my petticoats, and then I...

01:20.380 --> 01:23.183
Ines? Are you okay?

01:23.183 --> 01:26.553
(Ines) Did you say
petticoats Lena? Don't.

01:27.320 --> 01:28.755
Noted.

01:29.590 --> 01:32.559
So, are you super excited?

01:32.559 --> 01:35.696
If by super-excited
you mean full of anxiety
and sick to my stomach

01:35.696 --> 01:39.700
about the biggest show
of my life, then yeah, Lena,
I'm totally psyched.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.101
Psst!

01:41.868 --> 01:44.404
Blok rehearsal tonight at 5 pm.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.206
Pass it on.

01:47.373 --> 01:51.177
Dude, I was waiting
for you at breakfast.
What's up?

01:51.645 --> 01:54.447
You're not still mad
I'm Max's understudy,
are you?

01:54.447 --> 01:55.749
Pffff.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.485
I get it. You're competitive.

01:59.485 --> 02:02.556
Don't worry, dude,
you'll get it next time.

02:04.257 --> 02:08.328
Anyhoo... Mini-muffin?

02:11.798 --> 02:13.333
Fine.

02:15.569 --> 02:20.574
That's really... (coughs)

02:21.341 --> 02:23.176
(Ines laughs)

02:23.810 --> 02:27.781
(Dash coughs)
Hmmm...

02:36.557 --> 02:38.324
(Dash coughs)

02:39.893 --> 02:43.263
Today's all about
the mid-season show.
No time to waste.

02:43.263 --> 02:45.265
Get ready. Let's go.

02:46.466 --> 02:47.934
(Etienne) Let's go!

02:49.435 --> 02:51.638
Boom goes the prank bomb!

02:51.638 --> 02:54.307
What was in that, mustard?

02:54.307 --> 02:59.345
(chuckles) Mustard, vinegar,
and Brussels sprouts.

02:59.345 --> 03:01.214
Okay.
You know.

03:01.214 --> 03:03.684
So
you want to play, huh?
Hm-hm.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.485
Game on.

03:06.820 --> 03:11.291
(classical piano music plays)

03:27.674 --> 03:30.511
No, no, no. Stop.

03:30.511 --> 03:33.980
This piece is about connection
and you're not even
looking at each other.

03:36.482 --> 03:39.385
Homework.
Learn your partner's role.

03:39.385 --> 03:40.621
(Jeff) What?

03:41.688 --> 03:45.559
I barely know
my part for the corps.
Or Max's.

03:45.559 --> 03:48.294
And now I have to learn Thea's?

03:49.563 --> 03:53.967
Cool. And thank you.
And please, sir,
can I have another?

03:53.967 --> 03:56.336
(Etienne) This piece is
for the mid-season show.

03:56.336 --> 03:59.039
Come back having perfected
your partner's role

03:59.039 --> 04:02.876
and show me that you've learned
something about connection.

04:03.510 --> 04:04.845
Dismissed.

04:10.016 --> 04:13.319
(Jeff stamps off)

04:16.456 --> 04:20.994
(magical tinkling noises)

04:26.366 --> 04:28.434
I'm not saying
you're not in charge.

04:28.434 --> 04:31.437
I'm just saying I have
some ideas of how to get
the portal running.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.439
Have you even tried
reversing the wires?

04:33.439 --> 04:35.776
Of course I've tried
switching the wires.

04:35.776 --> 04:39.846
I'm the brains around here.
And I am in charge.

04:39.846 --> 04:42.749
(Clive) Oh no, not again...

04:43.449 --> 04:44.518
(Clive) Oh!

04:49.723 --> 04:53.393
Holy moly, it's working!

04:55.328 --> 04:57.363
Maybe Clive should be in charge.

04:57.864 --> 05:00.366
(Frank) No! No!
(both grunting)

05:01.067 --> 05:02.435
(Henri groans)

05:04.538 --> 05:08.875
Pinky, it's an unstable portal!
It'll only last a few hours.

05:08.875 --> 05:13.947
Take the watch, it's synced,
it's synced to the portal.

05:14.848 --> 05:18.418
It will tell you when
the power is running low.
Get Clive!

05:18.418 --> 05:19.720
On it!

05:21.655 --> 05:25.992
No! Henri!
Henri! Please!

05:26.893 --> 05:29.495
You don't know
how the port-a-portal works!

05:29.495 --> 05:31.832
You're going to ruin
the mission!

05:32.666 --> 05:35.536
(Henri) I'm sorry, mate. (pants)

05:37.370 --> 05:39.405
The future awaits.

05:40.507 --> 05:43.710
The only thing
that matters is Lena.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.797
(Pinky) We did it.
The port-a-portal worked.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.566
I bet they have croissants here.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.433
Had them in 1905 too, Clive.

06:07.433 --> 06:11.772
Oh, right. (chuckles)
Croissants are the best.

06:12.072 --> 06:13.874
You hear that? No.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.777
It's the sweet sound of
no one bossing us around.

06:17.077 --> 06:22.616
Oh yeah!
No Frank means more fun.

06:23.817 --> 06:25.619
(chuckles)

06:25.619 --> 06:30.791
Frank's only figured out how
to make the portal last for a
few hours so we need to hurry.

06:30.791 --> 06:35.629
On the other hand,
once we get Lena
and the timepiece,

06:35.629 --> 06:38.699
maybe we don't have
to go back...
Yeah.

06:38.699 --> 06:41.134
Maybe we keep them
for ourselves...
Yeah.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.504
I could be the boss...

06:43.504 --> 06:44.470
(door opens)

06:45.171 --> 06:46.206
Hi, Henri!

06:46.206 --> 06:48.509
New plan!
You get the girl.
I'll get Henri.

06:48.509 --> 06:51.011
Meet me back here
at 7.45 sharp!

06:57.851 --> 07:00.587
(Henri pants)

07:01.588 --> 07:05.526
Dear Leng. Dear Leng?
That's not good.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.595
Come on, focus.

07:10.496 --> 07:11.998

08:14.695 --> 08:16.262
Do you think
he's coming tonight?

08:16.262 --> 08:19.032
Wouldn't he have told you
if he was actually coming?

08:20.133 --> 08:24.070
I guess. I just have
a really weird feeling.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.843
I can't take any chances.
I'm gonna go to the roof
right now just in case...

08:29.843 --> 08:32.245
Dude, chill.
That's hours away.

08:32.245 --> 08:36.216
Come to the Blok.
It'll take your mind off things.
Then later I can go up with you.

08:36.717 --> 08:37.784
Okay?

08:38.785 --> 08:41.522
Yeah, you're right.
I just need to keep busy.

08:43.557 --> 08:46.960
Hey man.
I got two salads. Want one?

08:48.562 --> 08:51.765
Thank you, my friend.
I would love one.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.773
Ooh, ah, a bug.

08:59.773 --> 09:02.308
(Dash) Dude!
You got me.

09:02.809 --> 09:04.611
Dude, it's like
you're not even trying.

09:04.611 --> 09:07.347
Oh, man.
I really thought
I had you there.

09:07.347 --> 09:10.951
(loud honk)
(Dash) Wow! (students laugh)

09:10.951 --> 09:16.189
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
that is how it's done.
Boom goes the prank-o-mite!

09:16.189 --> 09:17.724
Hm-hm.

09:20.126 --> 09:22.663
(chuckles)
What is going on over there?

09:22.663 --> 09:25.298
Apparently, the boys
are childish and
are having a "prank off."

09:26.132 --> 09:30.236
A practical joking contest?
I was the best at those
back home.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.374
Truly. I was unrivaled.

09:34.374 --> 09:40.146
Sure, but uhm...
Do you not think
1905 pranks were a little...

09:40.781 --> 09:45.118
What's the polite way
of saying this... lame?

09:45.118 --> 09:46.787
They are not!

09:47.788 --> 09:50.056
I once filled my tutor's bag
with clay.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.026
It was so heavy
he couldn't even lift it.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.095
What a daredevil.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.998
I'm failing. I need a prank.

09:59.365 --> 10:03.770
(Dash) Got one! I'm going
to use my muscle cream.
Thanks, guys!

10:03.770 --> 10:07.608
Oh, I am so getting in on this.

10:11.077 --> 10:13.780
(people chattering)
(car horns honking)

10:14.214 --> 10:15.649
No.

10:24.991 --> 10:26.092
Now I got you, mate.

10:29.696 --> 10:32.232
Hello, gorgeous!

10:33.867 --> 10:36.837
Sweet sweet melon
wrapped in fresh fresh mint!

10:39.205 --> 10:42.809
(Pinky) Ah! C'est la vie!

10:43.877 --> 10:46.112
(Lena)
These tunnels are like a maze.

10:47.180 --> 10:51.317
Ah, it's really frustrating.
Henri just doesn't
tell me anything.

10:51.317 --> 10:55.055
Don't worry.
The Blok will distract you.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.422
You're right.

10:56.422 --> 10:58.959
(Jeff) Come on! Can we
just run over the moves
for Etienne's class?

10:58.959 --> 11:00.727
I need to learn like
a zillion parts.

11:00.727 --> 11:02.295
No! This is
a Blok rehearsal.

11:03.864 --> 11:07.067
I think it's important that
we do... I just really need
to run over it, man.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.235
I know you...
(Max) Fine!

11:09.235 --> 11:11.404
Etienne first, then the Blok.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.006
I'll start.

11:14.240 --> 11:18.311
(copies Max)
Yo. You ready, chica?
This is how we do it.

11:18.311 --> 11:24.217
My way.
Because I'm always right.
And I'm cool and mysterious.

11:24.217 --> 11:27.721
(Max copies Lena)
That is not how I do it.
Have you no manners?

11:27.721 --> 11:30.724
(Jeff gasps)
(Lena chuckles)

11:30.724 --> 11:32.526
Burn.

11:32.526 --> 11:37.898
(Dash) Is it just me or is it
getting really hot in here?
You want to get the door, Jeff?

11:38.264 --> 11:40.400
(Jeff) Okay, I'll bite.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.202
Guys, guys, guys!

11:43.804 --> 11:45.906
(Jeff) It's not opening.
It's like stuck.

11:45.906 --> 11:50.243
Boom goes the prank-o-mite!
Who's the prank master?

11:50.243 --> 11:52.846
(Jeff) Wow. You slimed a door.

11:52.846 --> 11:55.882
(Dash) That's no slime.
That's muscle cream.

11:55.882 --> 11:59.820
(Jeff laughs) (Dash)
Don't touch your eyes
though, that stuff burns.

12:00.954 --> 12:09.963
Oh, I've been schooled.
The crown is yours, man.
First, worst prank ever.

12:09.963 --> 12:13.333
Second, what kind of
muscle cream is this?!

12:13.333 --> 12:18.071
(Lena) Wait, you used
your cream on the door?
Oh no...

12:19.773 --> 12:21.374
I switched the cream for glue.

12:21.775 --> 12:24.444
What? Why?!

12:25.879 --> 12:29.382
I wanted to join
your practical joking contest.
(laughs nervously)

12:29.382 --> 12:33.820
Wow. I'll admit,
that's a good one. (chuckles)

12:40.861 --> 12:45.932
This isn't ordinary glue.
I made it.

12:45.932 --> 12:50.336
It's extra-strength cement glue.

12:50.336 --> 12:54.140
I'm really sorry,
I thought it would be funny.

12:54.140 --> 12:57.043
I didn't realize...
(others grunt and sigh)

12:57.944 --> 13:01.414
(Dash) So we're stuck down here,
locked in the basement
with cement glue?!

13:01.414 --> 13:03.950
All the other tunnels
lead to dead ends.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.552
This is the only way out.

13:05.552 --> 13:12.392
(Dash) We could be down here
for days. Guys! We're doomed.
I'll call someone.

13:13.459 --> 13:17.197
This is a dead zone, remember?
As if I haven't already tried.

13:17.197 --> 13:20.934
(Ines) OK. We'll just have
to wait until someone
comes and finds us.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.936
(Dash) What if we miss curfew?

13:22.936 --> 13:24.204
What if I have to go
to the bathroom?

13:27.941 --> 13:30.143
What if I miss Henri?

13:37.851 --> 13:43.423
(Lena jiggling the door knob,
kicking the door)

13:43.423 --> 13:46.192
Hey, I know
you wanna get out,
but the door isn't moving.

13:46.192 --> 13:51.231
(Lena) Why did I do this?
What if this is my only chance?
What if I never...

13:51.231 --> 13:54.535
Don't worry.
We'll find another way.

13:54.901 --> 13:56.537
(Dash) Get off!

13:56.537 --> 13:59.305
What? This was your prank.

13:59.305 --> 14:01.141
(Dash) Technically
this one's on Lena.

14:01.908 --> 14:04.978
Actually, it was you two
that started it. Come on.

14:04.978 --> 14:07.147
(Dash and Jeff sigh)

14:08.214 --> 14:12.152
(Ines) Look, don't worry
No one is going to blame you.
It's all going to be fine.

14:16.322 --> 14:18.625
(voices in the distance)

14:18.625 --> 14:20.326
I can hear their voices.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.395
The door is stuck.

14:24.898 --> 14:26.232
Lena.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.635
There's another door.

14:36.109 --> 14:37.410
(Clive) Are you Lena?

14:38.411 --> 14:39.880
Are you Lena?

14:40.547 --> 14:43.650
(video game sounds)

14:43.650 --> 14:46.352
What is that sweet siren song?

14:47.053 --> 14:49.956
Future games!
I love future games!

14:52.693 --> 14:55.328
Wow. That's crackerjack.
What does this do?

14:55.328 --> 14:57.230
Shh... I'm going to get
the high score.

14:57.230 --> 15:00.300
I bet I could beat you.
You should give it to me.
Let me try.

15:00.300 --> 15:04.204
Go left.
Jump. Mash.
Down. Turn.

15:04.204 --> 15:05.739
Hey!

15:05.739 --> 15:08.408
Best of three?
Frank would never let me do this
in the middle of a mission.

15:08.408 --> 15:12.513
So don't tell him, OK?
I'll go first.

15:12.513 --> 15:15.215
And likely second.
You're not in a rush, are you?

15:15.516 --> 15:16.983
Have you played that before?

15:16.983 --> 15:21.655
No. But I'm a natural.
Gather round, kids.
This is going to be epic.

15:22.388 --> 15:25.158
Hey, before I get
knee-deep
in gaming glory,

15:25.158 --> 15:27.193
anyone here seen a girl
called Lena?

15:27.961 --> 15:31.998
No? No?
Right-o then.
Mission attended to.

15:31.998 --> 15:35.035
Next stop,
the forest of doom....

15:41.675 --> 15:44.678
(Jeff gasps)
I've got it!

15:44.678 --> 15:47.413
Let's play Truth or Dare. Dash?

15:47.413 --> 15:50.517
(Dash) Truth. Admit you're
the world's worst
prankster.

15:50.517 --> 15:54.555
(Dash) What? No.
I'm awesome.
You're the worst. (laughs)

15:55.155 --> 15:57.658
Next. Ines, Truth or Dare.

15:57.658 --> 15:59.059
(Ines) Uh... Dash.
I'm a little busy.

15:59.059 --> 16:03.564
(Jeff) Oh, come on,
I've seen you reading
those space-math books!

16:03.564 --> 16:05.331
Fine. Truth.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.200
Admit you're my girlfriend.

16:07.200 --> 16:11.204
(Jeff) Oooh!
Going right for the juggler.

16:11.204 --> 16:12.338
You mean the jugular?

16:13.039 --> 16:15.041
Whatever,
you figured it out.

16:15.041 --> 16:17.077
Okay.
I've changed my mind.
Dare.

16:17.377 --> 16:20.013
(Dash) Then, I dare you
to be my girlfriend.

16:20.013 --> 16:22.148
Oh, come on,
you like me, just admit it.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.518
No, Dash.
I don't like you.
I've never liked you.

16:24.518 --> 16:27.087
And I've told you this
about a thousand times.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.093
(Thea) My turn.
Truth or Dare...

16:33.093 --> 16:34.260
(Dash) Sorry, Ines.

16:34.260 --> 16:35.228
Lena.

16:35.529 --> 16:37.030
I don't want to play.

16:38.364 --> 16:41.401
Come on.
Tell us five things you love
about your boyfriend, Henri.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.403
She said
she didn't want to play.

16:47.307 --> 16:50.076
I'm the one who got us into
this, so I should get us out.

16:50.076 --> 16:52.145
There has to be
a way out of here.

16:58.284 --> 17:01.387
(Henri, out of breath)

17:12.132 --> 17:15.135
(whooshing sound, ticking clock)

17:15.135 --> 17:16.302
This way!

17:16.302 --> 17:19.105
What? How do you know?

17:19.405 --> 17:23.644
(Jeff) Yeah...
This isn't the making of
a bad horror movie.

17:23.644 --> 17:27.480
A dark tunnel
full of cobwebs.
No, thank you.

17:27.480 --> 17:30.183
Nope. Truth or Dare is back on!

17:30.183 --> 17:33.086
Thea, I dare you
to rehearse with me.

17:33.086 --> 17:34.755
(sighing)

17:36.623 --> 17:39.626
Alright. Let's split up.

17:39.626 --> 17:42.095
I've been here before.
I can feel it.

17:43.797 --> 17:48.268
Hey, uh. Before, I didn't mean
to say anything... Please don't.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.338
(Thea) We may
as well rehearse.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.408
(Jeff) Check this out!

18:01.181 --> 18:02.849
(Jeff sighs)

18:03.584 --> 18:05.118
What's up?

18:06.853 --> 18:08.755
He's always with her.

18:09.523 --> 18:11.692
Dancing with her,
taking her side.

18:11.692 --> 18:15.361
Following her into
dark dirty tunnels!

18:15.361 --> 18:22.102
(chuckles) I'm sorry, T.
Max is a heartbreaker.
Believe me, I get it.

18:23.236 --> 18:27.307
Oh man, I'm so hungry. Oh!

18:30.711 --> 18:32.646
Ohhhh! (spits it out)

18:33.346 --> 18:38.484
I dipped that in chili oil.
That was for Dash.
Oh God, I pranked myself!

18:38.484 --> 18:40.854
(Jeff) My mouth is on fire!

18:40.854 --> 18:43.890
(Jeff yells)

18:43.890 --> 18:45.926
Oh, I need water, water!

18:45.926 --> 18:49.796
What are all those boxes
doing here?

18:54.701 --> 18:56.236
Let's go.

18:56.236 --> 18:57.804
(lisps) What about the others?

18:57.804 --> 18:59.573
They'll figure it out.

18:59.573 --> 19:02.876
Come on, I've got a monster
prank idea to get them back,
but we need a bit of lead time.

19:02.876 --> 19:06.613
(lisps)
You are devious. I love it.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.852
(video game noises)

19:13.720 --> 19:14.521
Yes!!

19:17.758 --> 19:22.262
Thank you.
Thank you, small ballerinas.
I love this enthusiasm.

19:23.363 --> 19:26.332
I bet you didn't even know
the secret world existed.

19:26.332 --> 19:29.402
You have to level up first,
then you go down the tunnel
to meet the wizard.

19:29.670 --> 19:30.904
He's the key for everything.

19:31.337 --> 19:33.540
That was great.
Wait, who are you?

19:33.540 --> 19:37.978
Never mind that.
Watch.
Ah... the secret potion.

19:37.978 --> 19:39.479
This turns the witch into slime.

19:39.479 --> 19:42.849
You just punch this button here.
Over and over, like this.
Here, you try.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.851
Yeah! M... more.

19:45.519 --> 19:48.622
Duck left. Yes! See?

19:48.889 --> 19:52.358
The wizard is right
through that cave. Go.

19:52.358 --> 19:55.562
Uh... we need to stop,
it's almost curfew.

19:55.562 --> 20:00.433
Yeah, but let me level up.
You can't stop in the middle
of Marshland.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.836
Wait, what?
What time is it?

20:05.639 --> 20:09.375
Whoa. It's almost eight!
I've got to run.
Thanks for the fun.

20:09.375 --> 20:12.278
Hey! That rhymes!

20:12.278 --> 20:15.015
You folks are aces.
This is a nice place.

20:15.015 --> 20:18.852
Keep on dancing.
I love your shoes.
Toodles.

20:25.959 --> 20:28.028
Phew. I'm so glad
we got out of there.

20:28.028 --> 20:30.430
At least we can put it
everywhere.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.534
(Thea) Watch it!

20:34.668 --> 20:38.471
My toes are valued at
twenty thousand dollars.
Each!

20:38.471 --> 20:39.506
You watch it.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.675
What?
You what?

20:41.675 --> 20:42.876
Who are you anyway?

20:44.578 --> 20:46.647
They call me the wizard.

20:46.647 --> 20:51.451
(kids) Hey! Come back!
Wait, my game!

20:52.953 --> 20:54.420
So...

20:54.420 --> 20:57.991
(Lena) This is all my fault.
If I don't get out of here,
if I miss...

20:57.991 --> 21:00.727
Hey, Lena. Lena.

21:03.429 --> 21:04.731
You're gonna be fine.

21:06.667 --> 21:12.873
I mean, we can rehearse
before class.

21:12.873 --> 21:17.644
And I mean, I hate to say it,
but you pretty much nailed
your impression of me.

21:18.912 --> 21:20.547
You got this.

21:36.329 --> 21:37.998
Stairs!

21:39.533 --> 21:41.568
Stairs...

21:41.768 --> 21:45.672
(to himself)
Great. What am I doing?

21:51.612 --> 21:52.679
Lena!

22:02.088 --> 22:04.625
Henri!
He's here! I know it!

22:04.858 --> 22:07.060
(Lena) Henri?
Lena?

22:07.493 --> 22:09.596
(Henri) Lena!
Henri.

22:09.963 --> 22:12.633
(Max) Lena!
Did you find a way out?

22:13.433 --> 22:16.503
A door. Awesome.

22:18.038 --> 22:19.372
Who were you talking to?

22:23.777 --> 22:24.845
Oh! Hey, Pinky!

22:24.845 --> 22:27.648
You didn't get the girl?!
You didn't get Henri?!

22:27.648 --> 22:29.482
Is it me, or is it just bad?

22:29.482 --> 22:32.452
Oh, it's bad.
It's really bad.
Frank is gonna be so mad.

22:32.452 --> 22:34.755
This time travel stuff
is harder than I thought.
(Henri panting)

22:36.690 --> 22:39.025
No! No! (groans)

22:39.025 --> 22:41.662
(Pinky) Victory!
We're not total failures!

22:41.662 --> 22:44.397
Leave me here!
You don't need me!

22:48.702 --> 22:51.171
Lena.
What was that, mate?

22:51.171 --> 22:54.007
No. No. Nothing.

22:55.642 --> 22:58.845
Henri? Henri!

22:58.845 --> 23:00.614
(door shuts)

23:06.452 --> 23:08.855
(running footsteps approaching)

23:11.592 --> 23:19.633
(out of breath) See, we did it.
Everything's okay. Come on.

23:19.633 --> 23:21.467
Yeah, just a minute.

23:28.542 --> 23:30.010
Oh, Henri.

23:42.022 --> 23:43.156
(Etienne) One.

23:45.559 --> 23:46.793
Good.

23:50.496 --> 23:51.565
Bad.

23:55.836 --> 23:59.205
OK. You two, just...
just stop, OK?

24:05.746 --> 24:08.048
What on earth are you doing?

24:09.115 --> 24:12.118
I'm really sorry but
something is happening.
I just don't know what!

24:12.118 --> 24:13.887
Stop it right now!

24:14.555 --> 24:16.489
(holds back laughter)
I'm sorry, sir,
but I just can't!

24:16.489 --> 24:18.592
(students laugh)

24:18.592 --> 24:21.161
(Ines) What is happening
right now?

24:21.161 --> 24:22.929
Boom goes the prank-o-mite!

24:23.496 --> 24:25.031
Boom goes the...
excuse me?

24:26.633 --> 24:29.570
Sorry. Uh...
Me and Dash had a thing,

24:29.570 --> 24:31.905
and I put itching powder
in his tights.

24:31.905 --> 24:33.707
Trust me, it was well-deserved.

24:33.940 --> 24:37.210
You, Ms Carré's office.
You, go change.

24:37.210 --> 24:38.745
You...

24:39.245 --> 24:40.514
Are you... itchy?

24:40.847 --> 24:42.516
It seems so, sir.

24:42.883 --> 24:44.150
Go.

24:44.851 --> 24:46.587
(Jeff) Cheeky.

24:48.088 --> 24:51.157
(chuckles) She got us stuck
in the tunnel!
She deserved it!

24:51.157 --> 24:52.626
Out!

25:18.985 --> 25:21.822
Henri, I'm so sorry...

25:21.822 --> 25:24.691
I can't believe you were here
and I missed you.

25:24.691 --> 25:26.727
That was you, wasn't it?

25:33.634 --> 25:36.069
I didn't just imagine it, did I?

25:36.069 --> 25:37.971
You know when you want
something so badly

25:37.971 --> 25:41.274
that sometimes you think
it's there when really...

25:41.274 --> 25:43.977
it was never
really there at all?
